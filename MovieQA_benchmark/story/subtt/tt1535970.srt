00:02:26,441 --> 00:02:28,875
- You know, I'm not really sure
I even want to do this,

3
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:32,243
but this couple
down at the precinct,

00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,874
they been at me for this

We've known 'em for 15 years,
I mean, Don and Jan Connolly.

00:02:38,687 --> 00:02:40,382
They're real good people,
but, you know,

but they can't have kids,
so he goes, you know,

want him to be like Hollis."

Shoot, I ain't even told
my wife.

Mr. Lucetti.

00:02:49,764 --> 00:02:52,494
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm just so nervous.

12
00:02:52,534 --> 00:02:54,661
This ain't my normal routine,
you know,

in a jar before breakfast.

14
00:02:56,938 --> 00:02:58,496
- Hollis.

15
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:00,838
- Yes, Doc?

16
00:03:00,876 --> 00:03:03,470
- This woman is not going
to be having your baby.

17
00:03:07,315 --> 00:03:08,680
- Why?

18
00:03:11,386 --> 00:03:15,152
- You have a birth defect.

19
00:03:17,359 --> 00:03:22,490
- You mean I'm infertile?
Sterile?

20
00:03:22,531 --> 00:03:25,625
- Everything else functions,
but...

21
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:34,165
- Have I always been infertile?

22
00:03:36,511 --> 00:03:39,412
- Yes.
I'm afraid so.

23
00:05:01,396 --> 00:05:02,385
- We got a jumper.

24
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:03,988
He's on the roof
at the Tamlacker Building.

25
00:05:06,468 --> 00:05:08,231
- Look, I'm not feeling
so well today.

26
00:05:08,269 --> 00:05:10,294
- Well, I'll get Partridge in
to relieve you.

27
00:05:10,338 --> 00:05:11,327
Let's go.

28
00:05:19,414 --> 00:05:21,905
- Please stay behind
the barricade, ma'am.

29
00:05:50,779 --> 00:05:52,371
- Hey, how you doing?
I'm Hollis.

30
00:05:54,082 --> 00:05:56,141
- You a cop?

31
00:05:56,184 --> 00:05:58,778
- Yes, but it's okay.

32
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:01,983
You can call me Hollis
or Holly.

33
00:06:02,023 --> 00:06:04,514
Some of my friends
call me Holly.

34
00:06:06,428 --> 00:06:09,955
- Is this your specialty,
Hollis?

35
00:06:09,998 --> 00:06:12,023
- Well, I'm a detective
in this precinct,

36
00:06:12,067 --> 00:06:13,534
and I do other work,

37
00:06:13,568 --> 00:06:15,627
but I take care
of this kind of thing too.

38
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:17,228
- What's your success rate?

39
00:06:19,674 --> 00:06:22,142
- It's decent.

40
00:06:22,177 --> 00:06:23,872
Tell me,
what's your name?

41
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:30,677
- Gavin.

42
00:06:30,719 --> 00:06:32,744
- Are you married, Gavin?

43
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:36,819
- No.

44
00:06:36,858 --> 00:06:38,849
- Then what in the hell
are you doing up here?

45
00:06:42,063 --> 00:06:45,521
- That was a joke?

46
00:06:45,567 --> 00:06:47,330
- It was an attempt at a joke.

47
00:06:49,704 --> 00:06:53,265
- Well, you're married,
obviously.

48
00:06:55,543 --> 00:07:00,480
- Listen, I'm trained to talk
to you for hours on end,

49
00:07:00,515 --> 00:07:03,780
and I'll go around and around
in circles until you're so dizzy

50
00:07:03,818 --> 00:07:06,048
that you fall off of here,

51
00:07:06,087 --> 00:07:09,716
but my gut tells me that you're
too smart for the standard bull,

52
00:07:09,758 --> 00:07:11,726
so why don't we
just cut right to it

53
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:15,252
and you tell me
what's your problem?

54
00:07:15,296 --> 00:07:18,891
- No, I think I'd like to go
around in circles for a while.

55
00:07:21,002 --> 00:07:22,094
- Okay.

56
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:29,508
- So how long you been together,
you and your wife?

57
00:07:29,544 --> 00:07:32,035
- 15 years.

58
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:35,174
- Is the sex still good?

59
00:07:35,216 --> 00:07:37,480
- Do we have to talk
about this, Gavin?

60
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:39,544
- No.
I could jump.

61
00:07:39,587 --> 00:07:40,952
- Yeah, well, from way up here,

62
00:07:40,989 --> 00:07:43,549
there's nothing we can put down
that's gonna save you.

63
00:07:43,591 --> 00:07:45,582
You know that, right?

64
00:07:51,232 --> 00:07:52,529
- So is it still good?

65
00:07:56,771 --> 00:07:58,602
- Better than when we first met.

66
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,608
- Isn't it usually
the other way around?

67
00:08:00,642 --> 00:08:03,406
I mean, isn't that the way
it's supposed to go?

68
00:08:04,779 --> 00:08:06,906
- Yeah, a lot of things
that are supposed to go one way

69
00:08:06,948 --> 00:08:09,041
end up going the other.

70
00:08:09,083 --> 00:08:11,210
That's one of the things
you learn in my job.

71
00:08:14,122 --> 00:08:17,182
- You been faithful?

72
00:08:17,225 --> 00:08:20,160
- Yes.

73
00:08:20,195 --> 00:08:22,322
But on the subject of faith...

74
00:08:23,865 --> 00:08:25,025
Do you have any?

75
00:08:28,636 --> 00:08:30,934
- Do you?

76
00:08:30,972 --> 00:08:32,303
- Yes.

77
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:33,500
I'm Catholic.

78
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:38,941
So no faith, huh?

79
00:08:44,419 --> 00:08:45,818
You got you a girlfriend?

80
00:08:50,592 --> 00:08:52,150
- Not exactly.

81
00:08:52,193 --> 00:08:53,785
- I understand.

82
00:08:53,828 --> 00:08:55,386
You one of them gay guys, huh?

83
00:08:58,132 --> 00:09:00,692
- No.

84
00:09:00,735 --> 00:09:03,863
Although I do live with one.

85
00:09:03,905 --> 00:09:05,202
He got kicked out of his job

86
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:08,835
when they found out
he was HIV-positive.

87
00:09:08,877 --> 00:09:10,970
I took him in,
helped him get a new job.

88
00:09:11,012 --> 00:09:12,479
And now he's-
- Gavin!

89
00:09:12,513 --> 00:09:14,174
Hey!

90
00:09:14,215 --> 00:09:16,843
What are you doing?

91
00:09:16,885 --> 00:09:18,250
- Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Gavin!

92
00:09:18,286 --> 00:09:19,913
Gavin, stop for a second, man.

93
00:09:19,954 --> 00:09:21,080
- What are you doing?

94
00:09:21,122 --> 00:09:22,111
- Gavin.

95
00:09:26,261 --> 00:09:28,559
- Fuck me.
Why is this so hard?

96
00:09:29,831 --> 00:09:32,459
- You don't have to do this,
you know.

97
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:34,195
You really don't.

98
00:09:34,235 --> 00:09:35,702
- No, actually, I do.

99
00:09:39,307 --> 00:09:40,535
And when I'm gone,

100
00:09:40,575 --> 00:09:44,568
you're gonna have to take care
of something for me, okay?

101
00:09:44,612 --> 00:09:46,273
- I won't do it.

102
00:09:46,314 --> 00:09:48,680
If you got something
that you need to handle,

103
00:09:48,716 --> 00:09:50,547
I suggest you climb in here

104
00:09:50,585 --> 00:09:52,052
and you take care of it
yourself.

105
00:09:53,388 --> 00:09:54,787
- I can't.

106
00:09:57,492 --> 00:10:00,723
- You're not up here by choice,
are you?

107
00:10:04,232 --> 00:10:05,893
- No.

108
00:10:13,107 --> 00:10:17,840
I have to stay up here
until noon

109
00:10:17,879 --> 00:10:18,937
and then jump.

110
00:10:20,481 --> 00:10:24,042
If I don't,
someone else is gonna die.

111
00:10:24,085 --> 00:10:25,143
- Why?

112
00:10:42,136 --> 00:10:43,330
- Mornin'.
- How's it goin'?

113
00:10:43,371 --> 00:10:44,360
- Good.

114
00:11:43,297 --> 00:11:45,356
- Morning, sir.
- Hey, guys.

115
00:11:52,673 --> 00:11:54,402
Oh, please, come on in.

116
00:11:55,877 --> 00:11:57,742
- You used to be a teacher,
right?

117
00:11:57,779 --> 00:11:58,768
- Yeah.

118
00:11:58,813 --> 00:12:00,337
- So I'm in
this art history class,

119
00:12:00,381 --> 00:12:01,746
and we're studying
religious art,

120
00:12:01,783 --> 00:12:04,684
and my assignment this week
is to write about an object

121
00:12:04,719 --> 00:12:07,745
that's sacred to me to which
I have an emotional attachment,

122
00:12:07,789 --> 00:12:09,484
and I need your advice.

123
00:12:09,524 --> 00:12:11,151
- Okay.

124
00:12:11,192 --> 00:12:14,719
- I found this
in one of the rooms,

125
00:12:14,762 --> 00:12:16,559
and I'm thinking, tonight,

126
00:12:16,597 --> 00:12:18,758
I'm gonna have
a religious experience.

127
00:12:21,936 --> 00:12:23,164
- So your question is,

128
00:12:23,204 --> 00:12:25,035
"Does having
a religious experience

129
00:12:25,073 --> 00:12:27,701
"with this
intimidatingly large dildo

130
00:12:27,742 --> 00:12:31,007
transform it
into a sacred object?"

131
00:12:31,045 --> 00:12:32,637
- You're so smart, Gavin.

132
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:36,411
- Well, it's highly
questionable.

133
00:12:36,451 --> 00:12:37,782
Maybe the real question
here is,

134
00:12:37,819 --> 00:12:41,277
"Is your attachment to this
going to be emotional?"

135
00:12:41,322 --> 00:12:44,257
- Oh, my emotions
get aroused pretty easily.

136
00:12:44,292 --> 00:12:46,157
- I'll bet they do.

137
00:12:46,194 --> 00:12:49,391
- Although looking at Buzz here
and then looking at you,

138
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:51,990
I can't help but think
"three-way."

139
00:12:52,033 --> 00:12:54,968
- Jesus Christ.

140
00:12:56,070 --> 00:12:57,697
I always enjoy
talking to you, Harper,

141
00:12:57,738 --> 00:12:59,763
but you're gonna get me fired.

142
00:12:59,807 --> 00:13:01,240
- Come on,
I'm just flirting with you.

143
00:13:01,275 --> 00:13:02,606
- It's a slippery slope.

144
00:13:02,643 --> 00:13:04,941
- How would you know?

145
00:13:04,979 --> 00:13:06,344
- Good one.

146
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:08,007
Haven't you got some work to do?

147
00:13:08,049 --> 00:13:09,744
- Oh.

148
00:13:09,784 --> 00:13:10,910
Oh. This is Shana Harris.

149
00:13:10,952 --> 00:13:12,817
She's in
the art history class too.

150
00:13:12,854 --> 00:13:15,652
Looking for a job,
so be nice to her.

151
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:17,749
But not too nice.

152
00:13:20,061 --> 00:13:23,394
- I didn't realize
you worked here.

153
00:13:23,431 --> 00:13:24,989
- No, I don't work very hard.

154
00:13:25,032 --> 00:13:28,866
- Does that make it
less of a coincidence?

155
00:13:28,903 --> 00:13:30,336
- I'm Gavin.

156
00:13:30,371 --> 00:13:32,839
Assistant manager.
Please have a seat.

157
00:13:34,208 --> 00:13:35,573
You live with that guy?

158
00:13:35,610 --> 00:13:38,078
- Yeah. We only just moved in.

159
00:13:38,112 --> 00:13:39,977
- How do you like it?

160
00:13:40,014 --> 00:13:41,242
- I like it.

161
00:13:41,282 --> 00:13:44,376
My husband's not so sure.

162
00:13:44,418 --> 00:13:46,978
- What's your major?

163
00:13:47,021 --> 00:13:48,886
- Accounting.

164
00:13:48,923 --> 00:13:50,481
- Ah.

165
00:13:50,525 --> 00:13:52,652
- I always thought
I'd do something in music.

166
00:13:52,693 --> 00:13:54,217
I took lessons as a kid.

167
00:13:54,262 --> 00:13:57,459
But got to earn a living,
you know?

168
00:13:57,498 --> 00:13:59,295
- People don't earn a living
with music?

169
00:14:03,771 --> 00:14:05,898
- I'm just looking
for a part-time job

170
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:07,271
to help with tuition.

171
00:14:07,308 --> 00:14:10,334
I'm a serious person,
and I'm very hardworking.

172
00:14:10,378 --> 00:14:12,403
I could do anything.

173
00:14:12,446 --> 00:14:14,243
- What do you play?

174
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:17,980
- I play piano,
but we don't have one right now,

175
00:14:18,019 --> 00:14:21,420
so I'm actually learning guitar.

176
00:14:21,455 --> 00:14:23,184
- Cool.

177
00:14:23,224 --> 00:14:25,351
Well, start when you want.

178
00:14:25,393 --> 00:14:26,519
- Really?

179
00:14:26,561 --> 00:14:28,722
- Hey, it's not my hotel.
What do I care?

180
00:14:30,765 --> 00:14:33,893
- Thank you.

181
00:14:33,935 --> 00:14:36,802
- So I see this very pretty girl
comin' out of 213.

182
00:14:36,837 --> 00:14:38,930
- Yeah. Shana.
Married.

183
00:14:38,973 --> 00:14:40,304
- Right, Shana.

184
00:14:40,341 --> 00:14:42,002
How'd you know that?

185
00:14:42,043 --> 00:14:44,307
- Little early for whiskey,
don't you think?

186
00:14:44,345 --> 00:14:46,074
- It's Saturday.
- Yeah.

187
00:14:46,113 --> 00:14:48,172
- I've spoken with her
a couple times in the hallway.

188
00:14:48,216 --> 00:14:49,649
They just moved in.

189
00:14:49,684 --> 00:14:52,209
- Anyhow, I see her
saying good-bye to the guy,

190
00:14:52,253 --> 00:14:53,220
the husband.

191
00:14:53,254 --> 00:14:54,380
- Yeah?

192
00:14:54,422 --> 00:14:55,821
- Next thing I know,
she's on the bus.

193
00:14:55,856 --> 00:14:57,915
Then she's at the hotel,
wanting a job.

194
00:14:57,959 --> 00:15:00,359
- I suppose you think that's all
just coincidence, right?

195
00:15:00,394 --> 00:15:03,761
- Well, yeah, Chris.
Why else would I be telling you?

196
00:15:03,798 --> 00:15:05,698
What else would it be?

197
00:15:05,733 --> 00:15:08,099
- Why can't you just accept
that things have meaning, Gavin?

198
00:15:08,135 --> 00:15:10,228
Meaning.

199
00:15:10,271 --> 00:15:12,102
What possible meaning
could that have?

200
00:15:12,139 --> 00:15:13,504
- Connections.
Destiny.

201
00:15:13,541 --> 00:15:16,101
- She's married.

202
00:15:16,143 --> 00:15:17,576
Where's the destiny in that?

203
00:15:17,612 --> 00:15:19,409
- Why do you always
have to be so rational?

204
00:15:19,447 --> 00:15:21,210
- Why is it wrong
to be rational?

205
00:15:21,249 --> 00:15:24,582
- Okay, we're gonna get
into a fight.

206
00:15:24,619 --> 00:15:26,917
- So how was your week?

207
00:15:26,954 --> 00:15:30,515
- Full of light.
- Fuck off.

208
00:15:34,262 --> 00:15:35,229
Hi.

209
00:15:35,263 --> 00:15:36,389
- Hey.

210
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:38,330
- My wife tells me
you're her new boss.

211
00:15:38,366 --> 00:15:39,492
- Yeah.

212
00:15:39,533 --> 00:15:41,296
Well, sort of.

213
00:15:41,969 --> 00:15:43,095
- I'm Joe Harris.

214
00:15:43,137 --> 00:15:44,263
How's it goin'?

215
00:15:44,305 --> 00:15:45,567
- Gavin.

216
00:15:45,606 --> 00:15:46,664
This is Chris.

217
00:15:46,707 --> 00:15:48,072
- Hey. Hi.
- Hi.

218
00:15:48,109 --> 00:15:50,168
Hi.

219
00:15:50,211 --> 00:15:51,178
- How are you, Shana?

220
00:15:51,212 --> 00:15:52,440
- I'm good, thank you.

221
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:55,779
- You guys want to come in
for a beer, sandwich?

222
00:15:55,816 --> 00:15:58,216
- Uh, no, thank you.

223
00:15:58,252 --> 00:16:00,015
Actually, we wanted
to invite you guys

224
00:16:00,054 --> 00:16:01,214
over for dinner
some night.

225
00:16:01,255 --> 00:16:03,018
- Great.
Any night but Fridays.

226
00:16:03,057 --> 00:16:04,752
- How about Wednesday?

227
00:16:04,792 --> 00:16:07,124
- Good.
- Sure. Why not?

228
00:16:07,161 --> 00:16:08,150
Can you email directions?

229
00:16:11,799 --> 00:16:12,891
- 7:00?

230
00:16:14,602 --> 00:16:16,570
- Fine.
Lookin' forward to it.

231
00:16:16,604 --> 00:16:18,834
- Great.

232
00:16:18,873 --> 00:16:20,033
- Bye.

233
00:16:20,074 --> 00:16:21,439
- Bye.

234
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:27,611
Landon.

235
00:16:27,648 --> 00:16:28,740
How's it goin', Landon?

236
00:16:28,783 --> 00:16:30,250
- Fine, sir.

237
00:16:30,284 --> 00:16:32,548
- The geniuses at head office
want to get rid of him,

238
00:16:32,586 --> 00:16:34,110
project a younger image.

239
00:16:34,155 --> 00:16:36,851
I tell 'em
he goes, I go.

240
00:16:36,891 --> 00:16:38,256
Selena,

241
00:16:38,292 --> 00:16:40,283
the most inhospitable
reservationist

242
00:16:40,328 --> 00:16:42,592
in the hospitality industry.

243
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:45,861
Probably responsible for 50 %
of the empty rooms in the hotel.

244
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:46,958
Right, Selena?

245
00:16:47,001 --> 00:16:48,468
- Hi, Papi.

246
00:16:48,502 --> 00:16:51,096
- Don't call me Papi.

247
00:16:51,138 --> 00:16:52,264
Head of security.

248
00:16:53,808 --> 00:16:57,801
We all feel much safer
knowing he's asleep in here.

249
00:16:57,845 --> 00:17:00,575
So I don't have any room service
slots available yet,

250
00:17:00,614 --> 00:17:02,479
but you can do
some housekeeping shifts,

251
00:17:02,516 --> 00:17:04,245
and then I'll switch you over.

252
00:17:04,285 --> 00:17:05,843
I'll assign you your own floor.

253
00:17:05,886 --> 00:17:07,376
That way, I can tell
from the complaints

254
00:17:07,421 --> 00:17:09,787
if it's you
who's screwing things up.

255
00:17:09,824 --> 00:17:12,816
Consuela, this is Shana.
- Hi.

256
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:14,851
- Show her how to do
a housekeeping shift, okay?

257
00:17:14,895 --> 00:17:16,920
- Sure.

258
00:17:16,964 --> 00:17:19,432
- Show a little respect.

259
00:17:19,467 --> 00:17:20,934
I'll see you later.

260
00:17:22,937 --> 00:17:23,926
- Hi.
- Hey.

261
00:17:23,971 --> 00:17:26,303
- Hi, guys.
Come on in.

262
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:28,035
- Thanks.
How's it goin'?

263
00:17:28,075 --> 00:17:29,474
- Good. How are you?
- Gavin.

264
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:31,307
- Hey.
- Chris, how are you?

265
00:17:31,345 --> 00:17:32,869
- Hi.
This is lovely.

266
00:17:32,913 --> 00:17:33,902
- Thank you.

267
00:17:33,948 --> 00:17:34,937
- Here.

268
00:17:34,982 --> 00:17:35,971
- Oh, thank you.

269
00:17:36,016 --> 00:17:37,005
- Yeah, you're welcome.

270
00:17:37,051 --> 00:17:38,040
- Thank you for the gift.

271
00:17:38,085 --> 00:17:39,985
- We need this.

272
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:42,488
- Please sit down.

273
00:17:42,523 --> 00:17:44,923
Would you like
a glass of wine?

274
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:46,859
- Sure, thanks.

275
00:17:46,894 --> 00:17:48,088
- Shana.

276
00:17:50,231 --> 00:17:51,994
- I could do that if you like.

277
00:17:59,573 --> 00:18:00,699
- Thank you for having us over.

278
00:18:00,741 --> 00:18:01,833
That's very nice of you.

279
00:18:01,876 --> 00:18:02,843
- Our pleasure.

280
00:18:02,877 --> 00:18:04,037
- Thanks.

281
00:18:04,078 --> 00:18:05,511
Is that yours?

282
00:18:05,546 --> 00:18:06,877
- Oh, yeah.

283
00:18:06,914 --> 00:18:10,748
But I wore out the strings.

284
00:18:10,785 --> 00:18:12,719
- How's school going?

285
00:18:12,753 --> 00:18:15,085
- It's okay.

286
00:18:15,122 --> 00:18:18,023
- You doing that same essay
as Harper, sacred object?

287
00:18:18,058 --> 00:18:19,457
- Yeah.

288
00:18:19,493 --> 00:18:21,461
- So what's your sacred object
gonna be?

289
00:18:21,495 --> 00:18:24,362
- Um, a teddy bear.

290
00:18:24,398 --> 00:18:27,196
- Wow, that's pretty radical,
Shana.

291
00:18:27,234 --> 00:18:29,168
Harper's going
in a whole different direction-

292
00:18:29,203 --> 00:18:32,297
- It's more complicated
than you think.

293
00:18:32,339 --> 00:18:33,806
It's a good essay.

294
00:18:33,841 --> 00:18:37,072
- Oh, I'm sure it is.

295
00:18:42,082 --> 00:18:44,573
- Maybe you could critique it.

296
00:18:44,618 --> 00:18:46,017
You're good at that, right?

297
00:18:48,722 --> 00:18:51,452
- So who else
is gonna get lubed?

298
00:18:51,492 --> 00:18:52,516
- We don't drink.

299
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:53,686
- Oh.

300
00:18:53,727 --> 00:18:55,922
- But please, feel free.

301
00:18:55,963 --> 00:18:57,055
Chris?

302
00:18:57,097 --> 00:18:59,361
- Uh, no, thanks.

303
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,799
I'll take a water, though.

304
00:19:00,835 --> 00:19:02,996
- Glass of water, Shana.

305
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:14,104
- So what do you do, Joe?

306
00:19:14,148 --> 00:19:16,139
- I work at the oil refinery.

307
00:19:16,183 --> 00:19:18,777
I'm a systems manager.

308
00:19:18,819 --> 00:19:19,808
And you?

309
00:19:19,854 --> 00:19:23,221
- I'm in TV.
I'm an editor.

310
00:19:23,257 --> 00:19:24,918
Yeah, right now,
I'm working on a show

311
00:19:24,959 --> 00:19:26,551
about the long-term
psychological effects

312
00:19:26,594 --> 00:19:28,118
of disaster.

313
00:19:28,162 --> 00:19:29,629
- Okay.

314
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:31,221
- Oh.

315
00:19:35,503 --> 00:19:37,733
- So you guys want to watch
the game here tonight?

316
00:19:37,771 --> 00:19:40,069
- Oh, no,
thank you.

317
00:19:40,107 --> 00:19:41,938
- No?
You don't like baseball?

318
00:19:41,976 --> 00:19:45,412
- It's okay, I guess.

319
00:19:45,446 --> 00:19:47,346
- Chris?

320
00:19:47,381 --> 00:19:49,144
- Well, yeah, sure.

321
00:19:49,183 --> 00:19:51,674
Maybe a couple innings.
Why not?

322
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,415
- How long have you two
been friends?

323
00:19:54,455 --> 00:19:55,615
- About a year.

324
00:19:55,656 --> 00:19:58,955
- Yeah, we're coming up
on our first anniversary.

325
00:19:58,993 --> 00:20:00,984
- That's right.

326
00:20:04,999 --> 00:20:08,628
- Would you mind
if we prayed for you both?

327
00:20:08,669 --> 00:20:09,727
- No.

328
00:20:13,607 --> 00:20:15,268
- Lord, thank you
for this wonderful meal,

329
00:20:15,309 --> 00:20:18,369
and thank you for bringing
these two men into our lives.

330
00:20:18,412 --> 00:20:20,505
And please grant them
the strength to fight

331
00:20:20,548 --> 00:20:22,072
what is abominable in your eyes,

332
00:20:22,116 --> 00:20:23,140
for we are all sinners.

333
00:20:23,183 --> 00:20:25,083
Amen.

334
00:20:25,119 --> 00:20:26,950
- Amen.

335
00:20:30,691 --> 00:20:32,022
And what exactly is it

336
00:20:32,059 --> 00:20:35,995
that you find so abominable
about us, Joe?

337
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:37,622
- Well, it's not my judgment,
Gavin.

338
00:20:37,665 --> 00:20:39,462
It's God's.

339
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,764
- Well, I hope God's a good shot
with those lightning bolts,

340
00:20:41,802 --> 00:20:44,566
or one of us is gonna get
wrongfully struck.

341
00:20:49,910 --> 00:20:53,107
Well, thank you for dinner.

342
00:21:01,155 --> 00:21:03,749
- He has very strong beliefs.

343
00:21:03,791 --> 00:21:05,349
- So do we, Chris.

344
00:21:07,595 --> 00:21:09,256
You know, there are programs
that can help you.

345
00:21:09,296 --> 00:21:11,161
- Joe.
- I can-

346
00:21:11,198 --> 00:21:12,665
- That's enough.

347
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:13,826
- Hey, you know what?

348
00:21:13,867 --> 00:21:14,834
Honestly, Joe,

349
00:21:14,868 --> 00:21:16,199
I think if you knew
all the facts,

350
00:21:16,236 --> 00:21:19,535
you wouldn't want me
on your team.

351
00:21:19,573 --> 00:21:22,235
Okay?

352
00:21:22,276 --> 00:21:23,265
Thank you.

353
00:21:24,411 --> 00:21:26,106
- Let me show you out.

354
00:21:26,146 --> 00:21:27,977
- Well, we're here
if you change your mind.

355
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,114
- I'm sorry.

356
00:21:42,296 --> 00:21:44,264
- Un-fucking-believable.

357
00:21:44,298 --> 00:21:46,391
I mean,
what a hateful fucking pair.

358
00:21:46,433 --> 00:21:49,527
The food wasn't even that good.

359
00:21:49,570 --> 00:21:52,164
And you know what pisses me off
most of all?

360
00:21:52,206 --> 00:21:54,800
Is that you buy into
his horse shit in your own way.

361
00:21:54,842 --> 00:21:57,072
- They don't talk about that
stuff at the Kabbalah center.

362
00:21:57,111 --> 00:21:58,169
It's never an issue.

363
00:21:58,212 --> 00:22:00,043
- Oh, read the damn book, Chris.

364
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,411
It says right in the Torah,

365
00:22:01,448 --> 00:22:03,973
"If a man lies with a man
as one lies with a woman,

366
00:22:04,018 --> 00:22:05,645
"both have done
what is detestable

367
00:22:05,686 --> 00:22:08,314
and shall be put to death."

368
00:22:08,355 --> 00:22:09,879
Jesus Christ,

369
00:22:09,923 --> 00:22:12,391
I let them hold my hands
and pray for me.

370
00:22:12,426 --> 00:22:14,087
- I don't think she's that bad.

371
00:22:14,128 --> 00:22:15,527
She apologized when I left.

372
00:22:19,199 --> 00:22:21,861
- Did she?

373
00:22:40,654 --> 00:22:43,214
- <i>"The object</i>
<i>that's most sacred to me</i>

374
00:22:43,257 --> 00:22:46,556
<i>"is a small fluffy bear</i>
<i>my dad gave me when I was nine.</i>

375
00:22:46,593 --> 00:22:50,359
<i>"He left when I was ten,</i>
<i>and I haven't seen him since.</i>

376
00:22:50,397 --> 00:22:52,262
<i>"I try not to blame him</i>
<i>for what he did</i>

377
00:22:52,299 --> 00:22:54,324
<i>"and remember that he loved me.</i>

378
00:22:54,368 --> 00:22:55,528
<i>"At least he did then,</i>

379
00:22:55,569 --> 00:23:00,802
<i>"because he told me so</i>
<i>with tears in his eyes.</i>

380
00:23:00,841 --> 00:23:01,967
<i>"I guess he knew he was leaving</i>

381
00:23:02,009 --> 00:23:05,035
<i>"and this was</i>
<i>his good-bye present.</i>

382
00:23:05,079 --> 00:23:06,706
<i>"It is sacred to me</i>

383
00:23:06,747 --> 00:23:10,513
<i>because it represents</i>
<i>my capacity to forgive."

384
00:23:57,064 --> 00:23:59,532
- Good job.

385
00:24:03,837 --> 00:24:05,202
How many beds
you get done in a day?

386
00:24:05,239 --> 00:24:06,900
One?
Two?

387
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:08,771
- I get my work done.

388
00:24:18,619 --> 00:24:22,919
- Just making a bed
in our own little room.

389
00:24:24,825 --> 00:24:27,350
It's okay to laugh, you know.

390
00:24:27,394 --> 00:24:29,726
It's in the employee manual.

391
00:24:29,763 --> 00:24:31,890
In fact, it says when
the management makes a joke,

392
00:24:31,932 --> 00:24:33,729
you have to laugh.

393
00:24:33,767 --> 00:24:34,756
- Ha-ha.

394
00:24:38,405 --> 00:24:40,965
- Actually, I just came by to
thank you for dinner last night.

395
00:24:42,509 --> 00:24:46,309
- Yeah, I'm sorry about that.

396
00:24:46,346 --> 00:24:48,007
- What are you sorry about?

397
00:24:48,048 --> 00:24:50,778
- The gay thing.

398
00:24:50,818 --> 00:24:53,252
- I'd like to say I'm sorry
I reacted the way I did,

399
00:24:53,287 --> 00:24:54,948
but I'm not,

400
00:24:54,988 --> 00:24:56,979
so I won't.

401
00:25:02,062 --> 00:25:04,758
I read your essay.

402
00:25:04,798 --> 00:25:07,995
It's pretty good.

403
00:25:08,035 --> 00:25:10,003
You want to grab lunch
and talk about it?

404
00:25:14,708 --> 00:25:17,643
I'll promote you
to room service.

405
00:25:17,678 --> 00:25:19,111
- How corrupt you are.

406
00:25:26,653 --> 00:25:27,881
- All right,
forget about it.

407
00:25:27,921 --> 00:25:29,320
I'll see you later.

408
00:25:29,356 --> 00:25:32,189
- I'd like to.

409
00:25:32,226 --> 00:25:34,057
It's just one of the maids here

410
00:25:34,094 --> 00:25:36,221
goes to the same church
as me and Joe.

411
00:25:37,497 --> 00:25:40,159
- I'm inviting you to lunch,
Shana, not to a hotel.

412
00:25:43,237 --> 00:25:45,171
In fact, we'd actually be
leaving a hotel.

413
00:25:45,205 --> 00:25:46,672
You'd be a lot safer.

414
00:25:54,548 --> 00:25:57,346
- He was a truck driver, my dad.

415
00:25:57,384 --> 00:26:00,251
He had this huge red truck.

416
00:26:00,287 --> 00:26:02,847
He was gone a lot,
and then he'd come back,

417
00:26:02,890 --> 00:26:05,882
and me and my mom
would be waiting for him.

418
00:26:05,926 --> 00:26:07,587
And the first thing
he'd always do

419
00:26:07,628 --> 00:26:09,653
was find fault in something.

420
00:26:09,696 --> 00:26:11,857
You know, like he had
to remind us who was boss.

421
00:26:14,635 --> 00:26:16,159
- Did he hit you?

422
00:26:16,203 --> 00:26:20,503
- Yeah.
Both of us.

423
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:23,270
But I don't think
he could help it.

424
00:26:23,310 --> 00:26:24,971
- Maybe he left
'cause he was scared

425
00:26:25,012 --> 00:26:26,877
he'd really hurt you
one day.

426
00:26:29,249 --> 00:26:31,911
- I'd like to think so.

427
00:26:38,792 --> 00:26:41,625
- Want a beer?

428
00:26:41,662 --> 00:26:43,027
- Beer at lunch?

429
00:26:43,063 --> 00:26:45,691
Quite the role model, Boss.

430
00:26:45,732 --> 00:26:47,723
- You never drink?

431
00:26:47,768 --> 00:26:50,032
- Almost never.

432
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:51,662
- You want to make an exception?

433
00:26:51,705 --> 00:26:52,763
- Why would I?

434
00:26:52,806 --> 00:26:54,171
- I don't know.

435
00:26:54,207 --> 00:26:55,299
'Cause it might be fun.

436
00:26:55,342 --> 00:26:57,936
Well, in that case...

437
00:26:59,513 --> 00:27:01,378
You got an opener?

438
00:27:01,415 --> 00:27:02,882
- It's not a twist-off?

439
00:27:02,916 --> 00:27:04,975
- It's okay.

440
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:09,313
- Holy shit.

441
00:27:09,356 --> 00:27:12,382
Decline blow job if offered.

442
00:27:13,627 --> 00:27:16,619
- Oh, my God.

443
00:27:29,509 --> 00:27:32,808
So your friend Chris,
he's into that Kabbalah thing?

444
00:27:32,846 --> 00:27:34,108
- Yeah.

445
00:27:34,147 --> 00:27:35,739
- What's it about?

446
00:27:35,782 --> 00:27:37,750
- I have no idea.

447
00:27:37,784 --> 00:27:42,050
Some new age crap like,
E.G.O., ego:

448
00:27:42,089 --> 00:27:43,784
Everyone's Got One.

449
00:27:43,824 --> 00:27:46,224
It's a total crock of shit.

450
00:27:46,259 --> 00:27:49,126
- Wow, you're kind of
an angry person, aren't you?

451
00:27:49,162 --> 00:27:52,757
- Me?

452
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:54,630
How can you not be?

453
00:27:54,668 --> 00:27:57,535
I mean, take this homophobia
crap, for example.

454
00:27:57,571 --> 00:27:59,163
If I was in charge
of this country,

455
00:27:59,206 --> 00:28:00,798
I'd ban heterosexual marriage.

456
00:28:00,841 --> 00:28:02,433
- What?
Why?

457
00:28:02,476 --> 00:28:04,239
- 'Cause heteros breed too much.

458
00:28:04,277 --> 00:28:05,574
Gay men tend to adopt.

459
00:28:05,612 --> 00:28:07,011
In an overcrowded world,

460
00:28:07,047 --> 00:28:11,916
why would any reasonable person
discourage them in any way?

461
00:28:11,952 --> 00:28:13,943
- Hmm.

462
00:28:24,831 --> 00:28:26,924
I better get back to work.

463
00:28:26,967 --> 00:28:29,800
Want my beer?

464
00:28:29,836 --> 00:28:32,066
- Sure.

465
00:28:32,105 --> 00:28:33,902
- Thanks for lunch.

466
00:28:43,784 --> 00:28:45,217
- Jesus Christ, Gavin.

467
00:28:45,252 --> 00:28:47,152
What the hell's
the matter with you?

468
00:28:47,187 --> 00:28:49,485
I'll tell you
what's the matter with me.

469
00:28:49,523 --> 00:28:52,048
The minute Joe started off

470
00:28:52,092 --> 00:28:56,426
on that homophobic
biblical bullshit,

471
00:28:56,463 --> 00:28:58,829
I decided to liberate his wife.

472
00:28:58,865 --> 00:29:00,457
I was thinking of it as, like,

473
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:03,526
a Operation Rescue
type of thing.

474
00:29:03,570 --> 00:29:05,333
I mean, come on,

475
00:29:05,372 --> 00:29:08,705
what's a woman like that
doing with a man like him?

476
00:29:18,718 --> 00:29:19,980
- Excuse me.

477
00:29:44,411 --> 00:29:46,606
- Daddy!

478
00:29:46,646 --> 00:29:49,513
- What are you doing back?

479
00:29:49,549 --> 00:29:50,982
- I forgot something.

480
00:29:51,017 --> 00:29:52,006
- You okay?

481
00:29:52,052 --> 00:29:53,883
- Yeah.

482
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:55,114
Why don't you all
get to your bus

483
00:29:55,155 --> 00:29:57,817
before you're late for school?

484
00:30:00,193 --> 00:30:02,024
- Hi.

485
00:30:04,698 --> 00:30:07,997
Is everything okay?

486
00:30:08,034 --> 00:30:09,524
- No.

487
00:30:09,569 --> 00:30:11,332
Come inside.

488
00:30:14,074 --> 00:30:17,134
- Hollis, what's wrong?

489
00:30:17,177 --> 00:30:18,804
Tell me.

490
00:30:21,781 --> 00:30:22,805
Tell me.

491
00:30:27,487 --> 00:30:28,784
Tell me.

492
00:30:28,822 --> 00:30:30,847
- Whose kids are these?

493
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:35,084
Whose kids are these?

494
00:30:36,763 --> 00:30:38,526
I'm asking you
whose kids they are!

495
00:30:41,968 --> 00:30:44,095
Will you just tell me
how you can let me,

496
00:30:44,137 --> 00:30:46,196
for all these years,

497
00:30:46,239 --> 00:30:48,707
go around thinking
these are my damn kids

498
00:30:48,742 --> 00:30:50,471
and I can't have any!

499
00:30:50,510 --> 00:30:52,000
Whose kids are these?

500
00:30:52,045 --> 00:30:54,980
Whose kids are these?

501
00:30:55,015 --> 00:30:56,209
Tell me!

502
00:30:56,249 --> 00:30:58,274
- This is not what you think.

503
00:30:58,318 --> 00:31:00,878
- What am I supposed to think?

504
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,870
Yea, though I walk through the
valley of the shadow of death,

505
00:31:22,909 --> 00:31:25,241
I will fear no evil.

506
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:28,275
Hey, forgive me.

507
00:31:33,687 --> 00:31:34,881
- You okay?

508
00:31:37,457 --> 00:31:39,925
- Yeah, now,
don't worry about me.

509
00:31:45,565 --> 00:31:47,260
All right, then,
where were we?

510
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:02,204
- Oh, whoa.
- Excuse me.

511
00:32:02,249 --> 00:32:04,649
- Morning.
- Mornin'.

512
00:32:04,684 --> 00:32:07,050
- Hey, Gavin.

513
00:32:07,087 --> 00:32:09,146
Sorry about the other night.

514
00:32:09,189 --> 00:32:10,952
Thought you were gay.

515
00:32:10,991 --> 00:32:12,925
- Hey, I'm a nonbeliever.

516
00:32:12,959 --> 00:32:14,551
You can hate me
for that instead.

517
00:32:14,594 --> 00:32:17,586
- Well, I don't hate gay people,
Gavin.

518
00:32:17,631 --> 00:32:20,122
- Love the sinner,
hate the sin?

519
00:32:20,166 --> 00:32:21,929
- Absolutely.

520
00:32:21,968 --> 00:32:23,765
You know, if your friend
doesn't correct his ways,

521
00:32:23,803 --> 00:32:25,065
he's going to hell.

522
00:32:25,105 --> 00:32:26,868
And I'd do anything
to avoid that, Gavin,

523
00:32:26,906 --> 00:32:28,396
because hell's a reality.

524
00:32:28,441 --> 00:32:29,567
- Well, I'm late,

525
00:32:29,609 --> 00:32:31,338
so maybe you can tell me
how you know this

526
00:32:31,378 --> 00:32:32,345
some other time, okay?

527
00:32:32,379 --> 00:32:34,176
I mean, have you been to hell?

528
00:32:34,214 --> 00:32:35,272
Ever met anyone who's-

529
00:32:35,315 --> 00:32:37,010
- How about Wednesday night?

530
00:32:37,050 --> 00:32:39,075
- Hell and homos,
Wednesday night?

531
00:32:39,119 --> 00:32:41,280
- And philosophy.
Salvation.

532
00:32:41,321 --> 00:32:43,152
- Look, I got to go,
or I'm gonna miss my bus-

533
00:32:43,189 --> 00:32:47,523
- Hey, you know,
don't be so close-minded.

534
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:50,495
- Are you willing to admit
that God might not exist?

535
00:32:50,530 --> 00:32:51,554
- No.

536
00:32:51,598 --> 00:32:54,294
- So who's being
close-minded here?

537
00:32:54,334 --> 00:32:57,167
- Maybe you can change my mind.

538
00:33:01,041 --> 00:33:03,509
- Okay.
Philosophy, Wednesday night.

539
00:33:03,543 --> 00:33:06,376
- There you go.
7:00.

540
00:33:06,413 --> 00:33:08,643
- Sure.

541
00:33:20,327 --> 00:33:23,353
- So how's the gay lifestyle
treating you?

542
00:33:23,396 --> 00:33:25,261
- Fine.

543
00:33:25,298 --> 00:33:27,892
How's the hetero lifestyle
treating you?

544
00:33:29,569 --> 00:33:31,696
- You ever been married?

545
00:33:31,738 --> 00:33:33,103
- Yeah.

546
00:33:33,139 --> 00:33:35,300
But something tells me
the problems I had

547
00:33:35,342 --> 00:33:37,139
are not the problems
you're having.

548
00:33:37,177 --> 00:33:39,543
- What do you think
the problems I'm having are?

549
00:33:41,915 --> 00:33:43,610
- Appreciating
someone's kindness

550
00:33:43,650 --> 00:33:46,710
isn't necessarily the same thing
as being in love.

551
00:33:49,022 --> 00:33:51,718
- Man, you have a big mouth.

552
00:33:53,226 --> 00:33:55,820
- Sorry.

553
00:34:01,267 --> 00:34:03,201
- Have you ever seen
a happy marriage?

554
00:34:03,236 --> 00:34:05,363
I mean, really happy?

555
00:34:05,405 --> 00:34:07,100
- I have to say,

556
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:09,973
for the first few years of my
marriage, I was very happy.

557
00:34:10,009 --> 00:34:12,876
- And what happened?

558
00:34:12,912 --> 00:34:15,608
- And then she left me.

559
00:34:15,648 --> 00:34:17,707
- When was this?

560
00:34:17,751 --> 00:34:19,582
- Two years ago.

561
00:34:19,619 --> 00:34:23,180
- Boy, you sure take your time
to recover, don't you?

562
00:34:26,192 --> 00:34:28,160
- You know what, Shana?
You're right.

563
00:34:28,194 --> 00:34:30,094
Way too long.

564
00:34:30,130 --> 00:34:32,064
But if you do
the charitable thing here

565
00:34:32,098 --> 00:34:34,658
and start having sex with me
on a regular basis,

566
00:34:34,701 --> 00:34:36,726
pretty sure
I'd start healing right away.

567
00:34:39,739 --> 00:34:42,003
You have a very sexy mouth.

568
00:34:43,777 --> 00:34:47,178
- A very sexy married mouth.

569
00:34:49,015 --> 00:34:51,984
- That's right.
I forgot.

570
00:35:00,093 --> 00:35:02,357
You see, the trick,
I figured,

571
00:35:02,395 --> 00:35:04,659
having been on the receiving end
of such a thing,

572
00:35:04,697 --> 00:35:06,824
was just to open the door.

573
00:35:06,866 --> 00:35:10,063
After that, if she had
the slightest interest,

574
00:35:10,103 --> 00:35:14,870
well, next time
her husband's cold to her,

575
00:35:14,908 --> 00:35:16,967
couple of thoughts blow in.

576
00:35:17,010 --> 00:35:21,947
<i>Pretty soon, what blows in</i>
<i>is more than just nice.</i>

577
00:35:21,981 --> 00:35:23,744
<i>It's perfect.</i>

578
00:35:23,783 --> 00:35:25,273
<i>I mean, why wouldn't it be?</i>

579
00:35:25,318 --> 00:35:28,549
<i>It's in her head.</i>

580
00:35:28,588 --> 00:35:31,989
<i>She thinks, "What's the harm</i>
<i>in just thinking about this</i>

581
00:35:32,025 --> 00:35:34,459
<i>if it makes me feel good?"</i>

582
00:35:34,494 --> 00:35:37,520
<i>And then it's,</i>
<i>"Well, what's the harm</i>

583
00:35:37,564 --> 00:35:40,226
<i>in just thinking about this</i>
<i>and coming?"</i>

584
00:35:43,169 --> 00:35:45,228
<i>And so she comes.</i>

585
00:35:47,674 --> 00:35:49,335
<i>Well, that takes care of that.</i>

586
00:35:49,375 --> 00:35:50,933
- Here we go.
- Thank you.

587
00:35:50,977 --> 00:35:55,380
<i>- What a relief.</i>
<i>Never again.</i>

588
00:35:55,415 --> 00:35:56,814
- The cantaloupe looks great.

589
00:35:56,850 --> 00:35:59,250
<i>- Trouble is,</i>
<i>a connection's been made.</i>

590
00:35:59,285 --> 00:36:01,719
<i>She remembers it vividly.</i>

591
00:36:01,754 --> 00:36:06,248
<i>I kissed her lips.</i>
<i>I was inside her.</i>

592
00:36:06,292 --> 00:36:08,692
<i>Maybe I even said I loved her.</i>

593
00:36:10,597 --> 00:36:12,155
- Hey.
- Hi.

594
00:36:14,534 --> 00:36:18,095
- <i>So look what we got</i>
<i>from a single remark.</i>

595
00:36:18,137 --> 00:36:20,765
<i>Now we add in something else.</i>

596
00:36:20,807 --> 00:36:22,798
Look, I'm embarrassed.

597
00:36:22,842 --> 00:36:25,902
What I said the other day
was totally out of line.

598
00:36:25,945 --> 00:36:28,209
I'm really sorry, okay?

599
00:36:28,248 --> 00:36:31,046
- It's okay.

600
00:36:31,084 --> 00:36:32,711
- It's not, really.

601
00:36:32,752 --> 00:36:34,549
I've never done that before
with an employee,

602
00:36:34,587 --> 00:36:37,147
and I won't do it again, okay?

603
00:36:39,025 --> 00:36:41,994
- You're forgiven.

604
00:36:42,028 --> 00:36:44,053
- <i>Abandonment-</i>

605
00:36:44,097 --> 00:36:46,190
<i>clearly a big issue for her.</i>

606
00:36:46,232 --> 00:36:47,995
<i>"What, I haven't even had</i>
<i>the guy for real,</i>

607
00:36:48,034 --> 00:36:50,628
<i>and now he's slamming the door</i>
<i>in my face?"</i>

608
00:36:56,543 --> 00:36:58,408
I know.

609
00:36:58,444 --> 00:37:02,574
But don't hate me yet,
trust me.

610
00:37:02,615 --> 00:37:04,776
I got mine coming.

611
00:37:08,388 --> 00:37:10,015
- Now, let me ask you.

612
00:37:10,056 --> 00:37:11,387
You ever look around

613
00:37:11,424 --> 00:37:14,416
and the world just seems
empty to you?

614
00:37:16,195 --> 00:37:17,685
- Oh, yeah.

615
00:37:17,730 --> 00:37:18,890
- Has it ever occurred to you
that maybe

616
00:37:18,932 --> 00:37:20,524
it's because
you don't have God in your life?

617
00:37:22,502 --> 00:37:23,526
- No.

618
00:37:23,570 --> 00:37:24,901
- Never?

619
00:37:26,306 --> 00:37:29,833
- Look, Joe, when I was a kid,

620
00:37:29,876 --> 00:37:31,503
I totally believed in God.

621
00:37:31,544 --> 00:37:33,842
But, you know, you grow up.

622
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:36,178
Well, I did.

623
00:37:36,215 --> 00:37:37,204
I looked around.

624
00:37:37,250 --> 00:37:38,615
I said,
"Santa Claus: No evidence.

625
00:37:38,651 --> 00:37:41,176
"The tooth fairy: No evidence.

626
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:43,245
"God, the same thing:

627
00:37:43,289 --> 00:37:44,722
No evidence."

628
00:37:44,757 --> 00:37:46,554
And then you think,

629
00:37:46,593 --> 00:37:47,821
"Hmm.

630
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:51,091
I wonder if I really need
all these imaginary friends."

631
00:37:52,532 --> 00:37:55,194
- So you think God's
just a pleasant thing?

632
00:37:55,234 --> 00:37:58,032
Like it's easier
to believe than not?

633
00:37:58,071 --> 00:38:00,869
- Well, easier for you, clearly.

634
00:38:00,907 --> 00:38:02,568
- No, Gavin, faith is hard.

635
00:38:02,609 --> 00:38:05,043
God tests you
time and time again.

636
00:38:05,078 --> 00:38:07,273
Sometimes He even demands
that you die for Him.

637
00:38:07,313 --> 00:38:09,076
You think that's easy?

638
00:38:09,115 --> 00:38:10,844
- For people of faith, sure.

639
00:38:10,883 --> 00:38:12,077
That's the problem.

640
00:38:12,118 --> 00:38:14,586
Like, I could never fly
a jet into a building.

641
00:38:14,621 --> 00:38:16,145
But those 9/11 guys could

642
00:38:16,189 --> 00:38:18,487
'cause they had faith
in an afterlife,

643
00:38:18,524 --> 00:38:21,152
not to mention 72 virgins,

644
00:38:21,194 --> 00:38:25,597
though why anyone would want
virgins, I don't know.

645
00:38:31,170 --> 00:38:33,832
- What did God do to you
to make you so angry at Him?

646
00:38:35,608 --> 00:38:37,371
Look at the world
that He created,

647
00:38:37,410 --> 00:38:39,344
all the beauty.

648
00:38:39,379 --> 00:38:41,973
- Wars and plagues
and genocides

649
00:38:42,015 --> 00:38:44,643
and earthquakes and tidal waves.

650
00:38:44,684 --> 00:38:47,585
And then,
after all that suffering,

651
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:49,611
what does your God do next?

652
00:38:49,656 --> 00:38:52,591
He sends most of us to hell.

653
00:38:52,625 --> 00:38:54,525
- Well, not if you've
been born again.

654
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:57,290
- Right, the old
baptismal Jacuzzi.

655
00:38:57,330 --> 00:38:58,922
- You have to accept
Jesus Christ

656
00:38:58,965 --> 00:39:00,364
as your Lord and Savior.

657
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,868
That is your only
entrance requirement.

658
00:39:02,902 --> 00:39:05,462
- Okay, so the Hebes,
the Hindus,

659
00:39:05,505 --> 00:39:08,338
the Muslims, the atheists,
the Buddhists,

660
00:39:08,374 --> 00:39:09,898
all damned, right?

661
00:39:09,942 --> 00:39:11,842
- They have to accept
Jesus Christ.

662
00:39:11,878 --> 00:39:12,867
- And the Catholics,

663
00:39:12,912 --> 00:39:15,972
'cause they're not
born again, right?

664
00:39:16,015 --> 00:39:17,209
- Right.

665
00:39:17,250 --> 00:39:19,241
- Face it, man,
it's kind of crazy.

666
00:39:19,285 --> 00:39:20,343
- No, it's not crazy.

667
00:39:20,386 --> 00:39:22,752
God gives us free will
for that purpose.

668
00:39:22,789 --> 00:39:24,814
Otherwise,
we would just be puppets.

669
00:39:24,857 --> 00:39:26,518
Life would be...

670
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:29,521
Life would be meaningless.

671
00:39:29,562 --> 00:39:32,258
That's the beauty
of eternal salvation.

672
00:39:32,298 --> 00:39:35,461
You see, anyone can go
to heaven or hell,

673
00:39:35,501 --> 00:39:37,560
because anyone can be saved.

674
00:39:37,603 --> 00:39:39,571
It's your choice.

675
00:39:39,605 --> 00:39:42,369
- Unless you're a kid in China
who gets hit by a bus

676
00:39:42,408 --> 00:39:44,342
and never even heard
of this getting saved deal.

677
00:39:44,377 --> 00:39:45,969
Where's his choice?

678
00:39:46,012 --> 00:39:47,240
- Well, that's why
it's so important

679
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:49,908
to spread the gospel,
try and save people.

680
00:39:49,949 --> 00:39:52,645
- I'm sorry.
I don't mean to laugh.

681
00:39:52,685 --> 00:39:55,085
I just find this kind
of fundamentalism incredible.

682
00:39:55,121 --> 00:39:57,146
I mean, all of you,

683
00:39:57,190 --> 00:40:00,057
totally convinced
you know exactly who God is

684
00:40:00,093 --> 00:40:02,687
and exactly how He wants
to be worshipped

685
00:40:02,729 --> 00:40:05,630
and all without a lick
of evidence He even exists.

686
00:40:06,733 --> 00:40:08,997
- No wonder
there are so many holy wars.

687
00:40:09,035 --> 00:40:11,401
Without evidence, how else
would you win this argument

688
00:40:11,437 --> 00:40:13,166
except by killing each other?

689
00:40:15,808 --> 00:40:19,938
- See, I see evidence
in all kinds of things.

690
00:40:19,979 --> 00:40:20,968
- So do they.

691
00:40:21,013 --> 00:40:22,241
And sooner or later,

692
00:40:22,281 --> 00:40:24,943
one of these guys
who hears God in his head

693
00:40:24,984 --> 00:40:27,475
is gonna get ahold
of weapons of mass destruction,

694
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:29,954
and then,
when it's way too late,

695
00:40:29,989 --> 00:40:31,923
we're finally
gonna ask ourselves,

696
00:40:31,958 --> 00:40:34,620
"Why, after thousands of years
of bloodshed,

697
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:36,992
"didn't we at least try
to do away

698
00:40:37,029 --> 00:40:39,122
"with this insane concept
of faith

699
00:40:39,165 --> 00:40:42,566
before it fucking killed us?"

700
00:40:42,602 --> 00:40:44,126
- You know,
maybe I'm just coming at this

701
00:40:44,170 --> 00:40:46,400
from a different angle.

702
00:40:46,439 --> 00:40:48,805
- And what angle would that be?

703
00:40:48,841 --> 00:40:51,674
- Well, it's not abstract to me.

704
00:40:51,711 --> 00:40:52,871
I go to the hospital,

705
00:40:52,912 --> 00:40:56,370
and I visit
sick children, right?

706
00:40:56,415 --> 00:41:00,044
Two days ago, I was
at the bedside of a dying child.

707
00:41:00,086 --> 00:41:02,680
His mother and father
were killed in an auto accident.

708
00:41:02,722 --> 00:41:04,314
He's about to pass as well.

709
00:41:04,357 --> 00:41:07,417
And he asks me
if heaven really exists.

710
00:41:08,995 --> 00:41:11,293
I say, "Yes, it does.

711
00:41:11,330 --> 00:41:13,730
It's where Mommy and Daddy are."

712
00:41:13,766 --> 00:41:17,793
About an hour or so later,
he dies

713
00:41:17,837 --> 00:41:19,668
with a smile on his face.

714
00:41:21,974 --> 00:41:24,670
So what would you have said
in my place-

715
00:41:24,710 --> 00:41:28,441
"Sorry, kid,
no evidence"?

716
00:41:29,982 --> 00:41:31,449
- No.

717
00:41:31,484 --> 00:41:34,612
I probably would have told him
exactly the same lie you did.

718
00:41:36,455 --> 00:41:38,082
But, Joe,
I'll tell you one thing

719
00:41:38,124 --> 00:41:40,456
I damned sure
wouldn't have said,

720
00:41:40,493 --> 00:41:41,824
and that's, "I'm sorry kid.

721
00:41:41,861 --> 00:41:45,024
You're going to hell
if you haven't been baptized."

722
00:41:45,064 --> 00:41:48,898
- Lord, forgive this man for his
hard heart and his blasphemy.

723
00:41:48,935 --> 00:41:51,267
I think he has suffered
much more than he knows,

724
00:41:51,304 --> 00:41:53,363
and he needs your love
and support now more than ever-

725
00:41:53,406 --> 00:41:54,395
- No!

726
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:55,498
Joe, I'm sorry,

727
00:41:55,541 --> 00:41:57,304
but you don't know
a damned thing about me,

728
00:41:57,343 --> 00:41:59,709
and I don't need your help
or your salvation

729
00:41:59,745 --> 00:42:02,839
or any other fucking bullshit
you may have to offer.

730
00:42:02,882 --> 00:42:05,180
- Don't swear
in front of my wife!

731
00:42:05,218 --> 00:42:07,618
- Gavin,
I think you should leave.

732
00:42:15,127 --> 00:42:17,493
- With pleasure.

733
00:42:22,768 --> 00:42:23,928
- Why can't you
leave people alone?

734
00:42:23,970 --> 00:42:26,598
- Don't you dare
talk to me.

735
00:42:26,639 --> 00:42:27,799
You get out of my sight.

736
00:42:39,218 --> 00:42:41,948
- What the hell are you doing,
Chris?

737
00:42:41,988 --> 00:42:44,388
- It's blessed water
from the temple.

738
00:42:44,423 --> 00:42:47,620
- And how much
did you pay for that?

739
00:42:47,660 --> 00:42:51,152
- I'm not going to tell you.

740
00:42:51,197 --> 00:42:53,529
- I'm surrounded by imbeciles.

741
00:42:56,869 --> 00:42:57,961
- Hi, I'm Frank.

742
00:42:58,004 --> 00:43:00,632
I met Chris at temple.

743
00:43:00,673 --> 00:43:02,038
- Hmm.

744
00:43:15,354 --> 00:43:16,343
Hey.

745
00:43:16,389 --> 00:43:18,914
- Can we meet
where we met before?

746
00:43:21,127 --> 00:43:22,560
- Sure.

747
00:43:24,330 --> 00:43:28,460
- When I was 18,
I got into drugs

748
00:43:28,501 --> 00:43:30,935
and then into harder drugs,

749
00:43:30,970 --> 00:43:34,064
and then I couldn't
afford them anymore.

750
00:43:34,106 --> 00:43:37,041
And then I met a pimp.

751
00:43:37,076 --> 00:43:38,703
And one night,
he sent me to see this john

752
00:43:38,744 --> 00:43:41,713
who liked to do it in church.

753
00:43:41,747 --> 00:43:43,146
But what he didn't tell me

754
00:43:43,182 --> 00:43:46,413
was that the guy liked to beat
the girl when he was done.

755
00:43:48,521 --> 00:43:52,389
I woke up in the morning,
and I couldn't even walk.

756
00:43:52,425 --> 00:43:54,655
I didn't know what to do.

757
00:43:54,694 --> 00:43:56,628
So I started to crawl
towards the altar

758
00:43:56,662 --> 00:44:00,098
to see if there was something
I could steal.

759
00:44:00,132 --> 00:44:01,793
But I didn't realize
it was Sunday morning,

760
00:44:01,834 --> 00:44:04,234
and I got caught.

761
00:44:04,270 --> 00:44:07,364
That was the day I met Joe.

762
00:44:07,406 --> 00:44:11,172
And he took me to the hospital,
and he stayed with me.

763
00:44:14,547 --> 00:44:15,741
If it weren't for him,

764
00:44:15,781 --> 00:44:19,945
I don't think I'd be alive
right now.

765
00:44:19,986 --> 00:44:22,819
He was the first man
who ever saw

766
00:44:22,855 --> 00:44:25,949
something better in me
than what I was.

767
00:44:29,795 --> 00:44:31,786
Joe takes care of me.

768
00:44:35,501 --> 00:44:38,766
- You don't need anyone
to take care of you, Shana.

769
00:44:40,973 --> 00:44:43,737
You're a strong,
intelligent woman.

770
00:44:43,776 --> 00:44:46,677
- Yeah.

771
00:44:46,712 --> 00:44:50,148
Will you do me a favor
and stay away from my husband?

772
00:44:52,084 --> 00:44:53,813
Please?

773
00:44:56,322 --> 00:44:58,153
- I'll do whatever you want.

774
00:45:01,727 --> 00:45:05,458
- Believe it or not,
you actually got through to him.

775
00:45:05,498 --> 00:45:07,227
- Really?

776
00:45:07,266 --> 00:45:10,360
- He's decided we need
to be more evangelical.

777
00:45:10,403 --> 00:45:13,031
We're going to a new church.

778
00:45:13,072 --> 00:45:17,702
They do missionary work
in Uganda.

779
00:45:17,743 --> 00:45:19,973
- What else?

780
00:45:20,012 --> 00:45:22,742
- They're against smoking
and drinking,

781
00:45:22,782 --> 00:45:24,613
immodest dress for women,

782
00:45:24,650 --> 00:45:26,277
and secular music.

783
00:45:26,318 --> 00:45:30,254
- Pfft.
Jesus Christ.

784
00:45:30,289 --> 00:45:31,779
Restrings your guitar one day,

785
00:45:31,824 --> 00:45:34,349
stops you from playing it
the next.

786
00:45:34,393 --> 00:45:36,827
- You're so flippant,
aren't you?

787
00:45:36,862 --> 00:45:38,454
You have no idea

788
00:45:38,497 --> 00:45:40,124
what it's like
to lose everything

789
00:45:40,166 --> 00:45:44,125
and to try and put it all
back together again.

790
00:45:44,170 --> 00:45:45,296
- Actually, Shana-

791
00:45:45,337 --> 00:45:47,601
- You don't know
what it's like for me and Joe.

792
00:45:51,210 --> 00:45:53,178
I'm sorry.

793
00:45:55,347 --> 00:45:58,339
I really didn't mean
to cause you problems.

794
00:45:58,384 --> 00:45:59,749
I'm a fuckin' moron.

795
00:45:59,785 --> 00:46:04,051
- Not even a little smirk,
Gavin?

796
00:46:04,090 --> 00:46:07,651
- I think I made a big mistake.

797
00:46:10,329 --> 00:46:12,092
You're so beautiful.

798
00:46:13,566 --> 00:46:17,730
- You're pretty cute yourself.

799
00:46:17,770 --> 00:46:21,137
That's why I'm gonna ask you
to stay away from me too.

800
00:46:23,175 --> 00:46:26,474
Don't make this hard for me,
okay?

801
00:46:34,353 --> 00:46:36,446
- Fuck.

802
00:46:56,175 --> 00:46:59,542
- She said stay away, huh?

803
00:46:59,578 --> 00:47:02,342
Guess you didn't listen.

804
00:47:02,381 --> 00:47:04,212
- No, I did.

805
00:47:04,250 --> 00:47:08,084
I stayed away
for, like, three weeks.

806
00:48:03,676 --> 00:48:05,075
- Consuela, what's wrong?

807
00:48:05,110 --> 00:48:07,044
- My father died.

808
00:48:07,079 --> 00:48:09,877
Please let him into heaven.

809
00:48:09,915 --> 00:48:12,577
You ask, too, Gavin.

810
00:48:14,253 --> 00:48:17,848
- Please let Consuela's father
into heaven.

811
00:48:17,890 --> 00:48:19,517
He must've been a good man,

812
00:48:19,558 --> 00:48:23,392
or Consuela would not be
such a good woman.

813
00:48:26,332 --> 00:48:28,732
I'm so sorry, Consuela.

814
00:48:42,414 --> 00:48:45,645
Getting serious, huh?

815
00:48:45,684 --> 00:48:47,982
- He's a nice guy.
We have a lot in common.

816
00:48:52,358 --> 00:48:54,053
- Is the rabbi gonna marry you?

817
00:48:54,093 --> 00:48:56,721
- Don't provoke me.

818
00:48:56,762 --> 00:48:59,731
- Sorry.

819
00:48:59,765 --> 00:49:02,734
- Look, as it happens,
we're gonna ask,

820
00:49:02,768 --> 00:49:04,565
just hypothetically.

821
00:49:04,603 --> 00:49:06,230
We have an appointment.

822
00:49:08,741 --> 00:49:11,005
- Good luck.

823
00:49:11,043 --> 00:49:12,977
- Since when do you smoke?

824
00:49:13,012 --> 00:49:15,003
- I don't smoke.

825
00:49:27,926 --> 00:49:30,394
- Mind if I join you?

826
00:49:30,429 --> 00:49:31,953
- Not at all.

827
00:49:37,269 --> 00:49:39,100
- Can I have a drag of that?

828
00:49:39,138 --> 00:49:40,662
- You sure?

829
00:49:40,706 --> 00:49:43,641
- Don't you start.

830
00:49:54,520 --> 00:49:57,353
I was on my way to the store.

831
00:49:57,389 --> 00:49:59,584
Got kind of claustrophobic.

832
00:50:02,795 --> 00:50:04,695
- Things not so good, huh?

833
00:50:04,730 --> 00:50:08,097
- Yeah.
Not so good.

834
00:50:08,133 --> 00:50:10,328
- I'm sorry.

835
00:50:10,369 --> 00:50:13,463
- You know what the problem is?

836
00:50:13,505 --> 00:50:15,598
When I was doing
what I was doing,

837
00:50:15,641 --> 00:50:19,202
I enjoyed it
in a sick kind of way.

838
00:50:19,244 --> 00:50:21,542
I really liked getting high.

839
00:50:21,580 --> 00:50:23,707
It was a relief.

840
00:50:26,185 --> 00:50:27,618
But it was killing me,

841
00:50:27,653 --> 00:50:30,816
and Joe showed me something
better that wouldn't kill me.

842
00:50:30,856 --> 00:50:33,484
- What?
What did he show you?

843
00:50:33,525 --> 00:50:35,356
- How to be at peace

844
00:50:35,394 --> 00:50:38,659
by being in touch with
something bigger than myself.

845
00:50:38,697 --> 00:50:41,165
- I got that for you.

846
00:50:45,637 --> 00:50:48,663
Come on.
Lie down over here.

847
00:50:48,707 --> 00:50:51,505
- That's not exactly
what I had in mind.

848
00:50:51,543 --> 00:50:54,637
- Come on. Trust me.
Lie down.

849
00:51:08,527 --> 00:51:10,791
There you have it.

850
00:51:10,829 --> 00:51:13,161
- What?

851
00:51:13,198 --> 00:51:15,325
- The universe.

852
00:51:15,367 --> 00:51:19,326
I mean, look at it.
It's incredible.

853
00:51:19,371 --> 00:51:23,273
You know, some of the stars
you can see on a clear night,

854
00:51:23,308 --> 00:51:24,536
their light,

855
00:51:24,576 --> 00:51:28,808
it's taken 21/2 million years
to get here.

856
00:51:28,847 --> 00:51:31,941
When that light started out,
the Ice Age hadn't even begun.

857
00:51:31,984 --> 00:51:34,976
When you want a connection
to something bigger,

858
00:51:35,020 --> 00:51:37,284
how much bigger can you get
than this?

859
00:51:37,322 --> 00:51:39,517
- It's pretty big.

860
00:51:39,558 --> 00:51:42,152
- Yeah.

861
00:51:42,194 --> 00:51:44,685
And we're a part of it,

862
00:51:44,730 --> 00:51:48,496
a lucky part of it,
'cause as far as we know,

863
00:51:48,534 --> 00:51:50,365
only Earth came together
in a way

864
00:51:50,402 --> 00:51:53,462
that enabled life to exist.

865
00:51:53,505 --> 00:51:55,735
I mean, what a break, right?

866
00:51:55,774 --> 00:52:00,268
Thank you, universe.

867
00:52:00,312 --> 00:52:04,305
And then you die, and that's it.

868
00:52:04,349 --> 00:52:06,909
- Oh, now I'm definitely
feeling better.

869
00:52:10,989 --> 00:52:13,014
- You should.

870
00:52:13,058 --> 00:52:18,428
Once you understand
that life is finite,

871
00:52:18,464 --> 00:52:21,399
you don't want to waste
a moment of it.

872
00:52:21,433 --> 00:52:22,957
- I hate to say it,

873
00:52:23,001 --> 00:52:26,232
but I'm not getting
the same buzz I get from church.

874
00:52:26,271 --> 00:52:27,761
- Why not?

875
00:52:27,806 --> 00:52:30,604
- 'Cause I want someone up there
I can talk to.

876
00:52:32,544 --> 00:52:35,445
- That's what I thought, see?

877
00:52:35,481 --> 00:52:38,973
You don't want a spiritual life
based on truth.

878
00:52:39,017 --> 00:52:40,609
You want a daddy in the sky,

879
00:52:40,652 --> 00:52:42,813
and even if he is
totally imaginary,

880
00:52:42,855 --> 00:52:45,517
he's always gonna be there
when you need him.

881
00:52:48,260 --> 00:52:51,821
- What I want is to be loved.

882
00:53:13,852 --> 00:53:15,979
- I'm sorry.

883
00:53:37,309 --> 00:53:40,244
- We thank you, Lord,
for your love and salvation,

884
00:53:40,279 --> 00:53:42,543
but we are afraid.

885
00:53:42,581 --> 00:53:45,414
If you call us
to do your work in Uganda,

886
00:53:45,450 --> 00:53:49,216
please give us courage.

887
00:53:49,254 --> 00:53:52,348
And also, Lord,

888
00:53:52,391 --> 00:53:56,987
please give us the strength
to resist temptation,

889
00:53:57,029 --> 00:54:01,295
for sometimes we are
sorely tried in this evil world.

890
00:54:01,333 --> 00:54:02,630
Amen.

891
00:54:02,668 --> 00:54:04,659
- Amen.

892
00:54:24,189 --> 00:54:28,751
- I don't think I've ever loved
anyone before you.

893
00:54:28,794 --> 00:54:31,888
Now I'm not even sure
I could live without you.

894
00:54:31,930 --> 00:54:34,398
- Joe.

895
00:54:34,433 --> 00:54:37,129
- But if we are to be laborers
together with God,

896
00:54:37,169 --> 00:54:40,627
then we have to answer
when He calls.

897
00:54:40,672 --> 00:54:42,902
- What about my education?

898
00:54:45,811 --> 00:54:48,143
- Is that what this is about,
Shana?

899
00:54:48,180 --> 00:54:51,479
Really?

900
00:54:51,516 --> 00:54:52,744
- Yes.

901
00:54:56,254 --> 00:54:59,655
- I don't want us to live
a small life, Shana.

902
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:10,191
- Yup?

903
00:55:30,255 --> 00:55:32,587
Hold on!

904
00:55:32,624 --> 00:55:36,185
Here.
Call me.

905
00:55:36,228 --> 00:55:37,354
- Who's Exley?

906
00:55:37,396 --> 00:55:39,489
- Oh, he used to work here.

907
00:55:39,531 --> 00:55:41,328
- I have to go to school.

908
00:55:45,237 --> 00:55:46,261
- Hold on!

909
00:55:46,304 --> 00:55:47,771
- I'll call you
as soon as I can.

910
00:55:47,806 --> 00:55:49,671
- Okay.

911
00:55:49,708 --> 00:55:51,699
Here.

912
00:56:24,176 --> 00:56:26,610
Hello?

913
00:56:26,645 --> 00:56:28,078
- Tonight around 8:00?

914
00:56:28,113 --> 00:56:29,671
- <i>Yes.</i>

915
00:56:31,316 --> 00:56:32,681
- Where?

916
00:56:32,718 --> 00:56:34,242
- The hotel.

917
00:56:34,286 --> 00:56:36,151
I'll find a room and email you.

918
00:56:36,188 --> 00:56:39,749
- You really put
some thought into this, huh?

919
00:56:39,791 --> 00:56:42,760
- <i>Yeah.</i>

920
00:56:42,794 --> 00:56:44,386
- So did I.

921
00:57:47,292 --> 00:57:48,759
- When do you reckon
you'll get back?

922
00:57:50,295 --> 00:57:51,956
- I'm just filling in
for someone.

923
00:57:51,997 --> 00:57:54,124
I don't know
when they'll show up.

924
00:57:56,201 --> 00:57:57,327
- Okay.

925
00:58:21,793 --> 00:58:23,727
- Hi.

926
00:58:29,401 --> 00:58:31,164
- Want a drink?

927
00:58:31,203 --> 00:58:33,171
- I think I need one.

928
00:58:38,009 --> 00:58:40,876
Are all these flowers for me?

929
00:58:40,912 --> 00:58:42,846
- Stole 'em from the ballroom.

930
00:58:42,881 --> 00:58:45,907
- Wedding?

931
00:58:45,951 --> 00:58:48,078
- Memorial service.

932
00:59:13,144 --> 00:59:15,476
You don't have to do it.

933
00:59:20,785 --> 00:59:22,582
Let me undress you.

934
01:00:14,639 --> 01:00:16,800
You're perfect.

01:02:31,342 --> 01:02:34,334
- You have a job.

956
01:02:34,379 --> 01:02:37,712
You have God.

957
01:02:37,749 --> 01:02:40,809
I am washed, sanctified,
and justified.

958
01:02:42,587 --> 01:02:45,021
Help me.

959
01:02:45,056 --> 01:02:46,785
Help Shana.

960
01:02:51,062 --> 01:02:55,226
- When I got home last night,
he wasn't there.

961
01:02:55,266 --> 01:02:58,724
Then he came back,
and I asked him where he'd been,

962
01:02:58,770 --> 01:03:02,399
and he said, "Thinking.
Where have you been?"

963
01:03:02,440 --> 01:03:04,340
- Then what?

964
01:03:04,375 --> 01:03:07,310
- And then this morning,
he was distant,

965
01:03:07,345 --> 01:03:09,609
and then he just went to work.

966
01:03:15,687 --> 01:03:19,054
- Why don't you leave him?

967
01:03:19,090 --> 01:03:20,887
I mean it.

968
01:03:24,028 --> 01:03:27,122
- I'm afraid of what
he might do to himself.

969
01:03:28,166 --> 01:03:29,724
- Like what?

970
01:03:29,767 --> 01:03:32,531
- I don't know.

971
01:03:32,570 --> 01:03:34,060
I feel scared of him,

972
01:03:34,105 --> 01:03:36,039
and I feel sorry for him

973
01:03:36,074 --> 01:03:39,407
and grateful and ashamed.

974
01:03:42,113 --> 01:03:44,343
But at the same time,
it's-

975
01:03:44,382 --> 01:03:46,714
I sort of can't even think
about him.

976
01:03:48,987 --> 01:03:51,182
It's like he's disappearing.

977
01:03:51,222 --> 01:03:53,850
All I can think about is you.

978
01:03:56,361 --> 01:03:59,125
- I feel the same way.

979
01:03:59,164 --> 01:04:01,029
I didn't sleep at all
last night.

980
01:04:01,065 --> 01:04:04,660
- Really?

981
01:04:04,702 --> 01:04:08,194
Could we see each other again
tonight?

982
01:04:08,239 --> 01:04:10,571
- How would you get out?

983
01:04:10,608 --> 01:04:13,304
- He's going
to some church thing

984
01:04:13,344 --> 01:04:15,676
from 7:00 to 10:00.

985
01:04:15,713 --> 01:04:18,079
- Chris too.

986
01:04:18,116 --> 01:04:20,676
Finally something
to thank God for.

987
01:04:29,994 --> 01:04:31,291
- I'm sorry.

988
01:04:31,329 --> 01:04:33,854
- Take it.

989
01:04:33,898 --> 01:04:35,126
I'll wait.

990
01:04:37,902 --> 01:04:39,392
- What do you want?

991
01:04:39,437 --> 01:04:42,736
- <i>Hey.</i>

992
01:04:42,774 --> 01:04:44,833
<i>I just wanted</i>
<i>to give you a family.</i>

993
01:04:44,876 --> 01:04:47,674
- What makes you think
I want to talk about this now?

994
01:04:47,712 --> 01:04:49,839
- Hollis, it was
just an arrangement.

995
01:04:49,881 --> 01:04:51,178
That's all.

996
01:04:51,216 --> 01:04:54,117
<i>Hollis, I was just afraid</i>
<i>of losing you, so I just-</i>

997
01:04:54,152 --> 01:04:56,120
- I'm up here on the ledge
with somebody and-

998
01:04:56,154 --> 01:04:57,382
- <i>Please, Hollis.</i>

999
01:04:57,422 --> 01:04:58,855
I love you.

1000
01:04:58,890 --> 01:05:01,120
- <i>I cannot have</i>
<i>this conversation right now.</i>

1001
01:05:01,159 --> 01:05:02,990
- I love you.

1002
01:05:03,027 --> 01:05:05,018
I love you more
than anything in life.

1003
01:05:05,063 --> 01:05:07,361
- Look, I got to go.

1004
01:05:13,671 --> 01:05:15,434
- You have to go?

1005
01:05:15,473 --> 01:05:17,100
- No, no, no, no.
I'm good.

1006
01:05:20,044 --> 01:05:21,875
So what happened next?

1007
01:05:29,354 --> 01:05:31,219
- Well, I better be going.

1008
01:05:31,256 --> 01:05:33,156
- Okay.

1009
01:05:33,191 --> 01:05:34,920
- Bye.
- Bye.

1010
01:06:31,683 --> 01:06:33,617
- I want to do it here.

1011
01:06:33,651 --> 01:06:35,243
- Okay.

1012
01:06:46,197 --> 01:06:48,222
- Take my panties off.

1013
01:07:40,651 --> 01:07:42,448
Oh, my...

1014
01:07:45,923 --> 01:07:48,016
I love the way you touch me.

1015
01:08:03,941 --> 01:08:06,501
- Who is that?

1016
01:08:11,082 --> 01:08:12,515
- That's my daughter.

1017
01:08:12,550 --> 01:08:13,847
- You have a daughter?

1018
01:08:13,885 --> 01:08:16,479
- I had a daughter.

1019
01:08:16,521 --> 01:08:19,217
- What happened?

1020
01:08:19,257 --> 01:08:23,159
- She died two years ago.

1021
01:08:23,194 --> 01:08:25,788
- Oh, I'm so sorry.

1022
01:08:25,830 --> 01:08:27,161
- I'm sure she's up in heaven

1023
01:08:27,198 --> 01:08:30,258
with all the other
little baby angels.

1024
01:08:36,507 --> 01:08:38,236
I'm sorry.

1025
01:08:38,276 --> 01:08:40,267
I don't mean to be
such an asshole.

1026
01:08:40,311 --> 01:08:42,472
I really don't.

1027
01:08:48,853 --> 01:08:51,788
I was driving her
to school one day.

1028
01:08:51,823 --> 01:08:54,951
And we'd had a fight.

1029
01:08:57,395 --> 01:08:58,589
The radio was on.

1030
01:08:58,629 --> 01:09:01,029
There was a song
we both really liked.

1031
01:09:01,065 --> 01:09:05,195
She was singing along.

1032
01:09:05,236 --> 01:09:06,965
I was watching her
in the mirror,

1033
01:09:07,004 --> 01:09:10,838
and I was just about to tell her
that it was all okay,

1034
01:09:10,875 --> 01:09:15,869
and then a truck
swerved from traffic

1035
01:09:15,913 --> 01:09:20,680
from the opposite direction,

1036
01:09:20,718 --> 01:09:24,745
and I had less than a second
to think.

1037
01:09:24,789 --> 01:09:27,952
And I don't know if it was
instinct or a bad guess

1038
01:09:27,992 --> 01:09:32,861
or maybe self-preservation,
but...

1039
01:09:36,033 --> 01:09:38,126
I swung the wheel
the wrong way,

1040
01:09:38,169 --> 01:09:40,967
and the truck hit her side
of the car.

1041
01:09:47,512 --> 01:09:51,175
And five minutes later,
she's dead.

1042
01:10:09,967 --> 01:10:13,733
My wife never blamed me,
exactly.

1043
01:10:13,771 --> 01:10:17,537
It was-the truck driver
had a heart attack.

1044
01:10:17,575 --> 01:10:19,475
It wasn't my fault, but...

1045
01:10:22,013 --> 01:10:24,174
It was in her eyes.

1046
01:10:26,350 --> 01:10:29,444
I needed her to forgive me,
and she couldn't do it.

1047
01:10:31,722 --> 01:10:36,955
And so we split up,
and I totally fell apart.

1048
01:10:36,994 --> 01:10:40,054
And then I got a job
in the hospitality industry.

1049
01:10:40,097 --> 01:10:43,897
And now I'm just dandy.

1050
01:11:03,955 --> 01:11:05,252
- Oh!

1051
01:11:05,289 --> 01:11:07,052
Uh, I thought you were out.

1052
01:11:07,091 --> 01:11:08,752
I was gonna get a sip
of your whiskey.

1053
01:11:08,793 --> 01:11:10,385
We-
- You ever think of knocking?

1054
01:11:10,428 --> 01:11:12,259
- Excuse us.
Sorry.

1055
01:11:12,296 --> 01:11:13,593
- What happened?

1056
01:11:16,500 --> 01:11:20,129
- Uh, you were right.

1057
01:11:20,171 --> 01:11:23,800
Turns out this center
is a little more conservative

1058
01:11:23,841 --> 01:11:25,274
than we thought.

1059
01:11:25,309 --> 01:11:27,834
- Light gets switched off
before it reaches the homos?

1060
01:11:28,913 --> 01:11:30,710
- Not exactly.

1061
01:11:30,748 --> 01:11:31,840
Dimmed.

1062
01:11:31,882 --> 01:11:34,248
- Sorry.
Really.

1063
01:11:36,687 --> 01:11:39,178
- Hey.

1064
01:11:39,223 --> 01:11:41,157
To the grave, okay?

1065
01:11:45,863 --> 01:11:48,229
- Oh.

1066
01:11:48,265 --> 01:11:50,062
- It's okay.
He's cool.

1067
01:11:50,101 --> 01:11:51,466
Both of them.

1068
01:11:57,975 --> 01:12:01,376
- You know,

1069
01:12:01,412 --> 01:12:05,508
if you and I
could ever be together,

1070
01:12:05,549 --> 01:12:08,541
I think we'd be really happy.

1071
01:12:16,994 --> 01:12:21,488
- Strange thing is,
I felt the same way.

1072
01:12:21,532 --> 01:12:23,625
I had to make a game of it
at the start...

1073
01:12:23,668 --> 01:12:26,432
'cause I wasn't really up
for it, you know?

1074
01:12:26,470 --> 01:12:27,869
Love.

1075
01:12:27,905 --> 01:12:31,238
- No wonder.

1076
01:12:31,275 --> 01:12:32,902
- I guess
it's always inexplicable

1077
01:12:32,943 --> 01:12:35,173
why you fall in love, isn't it?

1078
01:12:35,212 --> 01:12:38,079
I mean, you tell me,
why do you love your wife?

1079
01:12:40,017 --> 01:12:43,316
- To be honest with you,
Gavin,

1080
01:12:43,354 --> 01:12:45,083
I don't think I do anymore.

1081
01:12:45,122 --> 01:12:46,453
As a matter of fact,

1082
01:12:46,490 --> 01:12:48,355
I don't even think
I'm going home tonight.

1083
01:12:48,392 --> 01:12:49,825
- Why not?

1084
01:12:49,860 --> 01:12:51,885
- She cheated on me.

1085
01:12:54,598 --> 01:12:57,032
I kind of lost
both of my kids today.

1086
01:12:57,068 --> 01:13:01,004
My little boy and my girl,
you know.

1087
01:13:01,038 --> 01:13:03,973
Found out neither one of 'em
was mine this morning.

1088
01:13:07,812 --> 01:13:09,245
- Why?

1089
01:13:09,280 --> 01:13:12,215
- 'Cause I'm sterile.

1090
01:13:12,249 --> 01:13:14,046
I just found out.

1091
01:13:16,854 --> 01:13:19,118
I've always been.

1092
01:13:19,156 --> 01:13:21,090
- Did you want kids?

1093
01:13:21,125 --> 01:13:24,424
- Like you wouldn't believe,
you know?

1094
01:13:24,462 --> 01:13:26,623
I mean, we tried and tried
for years,

1095
01:13:26,664 --> 01:13:29,861
and when nothing happened,

1096
01:13:29,900 --> 01:13:32,130
eventually we went over
to the clinic,

1097
01:13:32,169 --> 01:13:34,433
and we got tested.

1098
01:13:34,472 --> 01:13:36,736
And I never bothered
to go and get the results.

1099
01:13:36,774 --> 01:13:38,435
But she did.

1100
01:13:38,476 --> 01:13:42,845
And when she told me
everything was okay, I was...

1101
01:13:42,880 --> 01:13:45,075
And then nine months later, we-

1102
01:13:49,253 --> 01:13:55,283
She said that she was afraid
she was going to lose me

1103
01:13:55,326 --> 01:13:57,920
and that it was just
an arrangement.

1104
01:14:01,632 --> 01:14:03,122
- Who's the father?

1105
01:14:10,241 --> 01:14:14,678
- She wanted the kids to look
as much like me as possible.

1106
01:14:17,882 --> 01:14:20,146
I got a younger brother, man.

1107
01:14:25,856 --> 01:14:27,380
Look, I'm sorry,
Gavin,

1108
01:14:27,424 --> 01:14:29,824
but please don't make my day
any worse than it already is.

1109
01:14:29,860 --> 01:14:33,352
Why don't you just
come on in here?

1110
01:14:33,397 --> 01:14:35,024
- Believe me,

1111
01:14:35,065 --> 01:14:37,465
if I could, I would.

1112
01:14:39,203 --> 01:14:41,103
- Hollis.

1113
01:14:41,138 --> 01:14:42,435
- Excuse me.

1114
01:14:42,473 --> 01:14:43,838
- Spoke to the roommate, Chris.

1115
01:14:43,874 --> 01:14:46,274
He says he thinks Joe's capable
of just about anything.

1116
01:14:46,310 --> 01:14:47,607
Shana never made it to school.

1117
01:14:47,645 --> 01:14:48,703
Joe never showed up for work.

1118
01:14:48,746 --> 01:14:50,111
I've been trying both
their numbers.

1119
01:14:50,147 --> 01:14:51,341
I got nothing.

1120
01:14:51,382 --> 01:14:52,940
- Please, keep calling them.
- All right.

1121
01:14:52,983 --> 01:14:55,281
How's he doin'?

1122
01:14:55,319 --> 01:14:57,947
- Do I think he might do it?

1123
01:14:57,988 --> 01:14:59,979
I think he could.

1124
01:15:00,024 --> 01:15:03,619
- All right.
Are you good?

1125
01:15:03,661 --> 01:15:06,528
- I'm having a rough day.

1126
01:15:27,651 --> 01:15:29,949
Hey, forgive me.

1127
01:15:29,987 --> 01:15:33,980
- Look man, the point is,
you got kids,

1128
01:15:34,024 --> 01:15:36,458
even if it wasn't exactly
how you wanted.

1129
01:15:39,597 --> 01:15:43,795
- Let's just go on
with your story, okay?

1130
01:15:49,206 --> 01:15:51,231
- Okay.

1131
01:15:51,275 --> 01:15:54,938
We decided to tell Joe
the truth.

1132
01:15:54,979 --> 01:15:57,209
But Shana wanted to speak
to the pastor first

1133
01:15:57,248 --> 01:15:59,716
'cause she was so scared
he'd kill himself.

1134
01:16:08,025 --> 01:16:12,257
- I know I haven't been
an exciting lover for you.

1135
01:16:12,296 --> 01:16:16,392
I know that I have been
too dominating

1136
01:16:16,433 --> 01:16:20,995
in a way
that wasn't interesting.

1137
01:16:21,038 --> 01:16:23,506
But I wasn't always like this.

1138
01:16:26,577 --> 01:16:29,011
I know how bad things are.

1139
01:16:29,046 --> 01:16:32,573
I just want one night.

1140
01:16:32,616 --> 01:16:36,712
Borrow an apartment.
Go to a hotel.

1141
01:16:36,754 --> 01:16:40,918
A night away from
what we're supposed to be,

1142
01:16:40,958 --> 01:16:44,587
a night to prove I can
make you happy that way.

1143
01:16:46,864 --> 01:16:50,459
Don't I at least deserve that?

1144
01:16:50,501 --> 01:16:53,026
- I have to get out of this
the right way.

1145
01:16:53,070 --> 01:16:54,697
I owe him so much.

1146
01:16:54,738 --> 01:16:56,706
- I know.

1147
01:16:56,740 --> 01:16:59,834
I know, and I know
I have no right, but...

1148
01:17:02,413 --> 01:17:05,109
- We only have to get through
a couple more days, okay?

1149
01:17:05,849 --> 01:17:07,407
Okay?

1150
01:17:09,687 --> 01:17:11,018
- Okay.

1151
01:17:11,055 --> 01:17:12,886
- I should go.

1152
01:17:12,923 --> 01:17:14,117
I'm doing the night shift,

1153
01:17:14,158 --> 01:17:16,126
and then I'm gonna go see
the pastor in the morning.

1154
01:17:16,160 --> 01:17:17,388
- Come by after.

1155
01:17:17,428 --> 01:17:19,123
Let me know how it went.

1156
01:17:29,173 --> 01:17:31,334
- I love you.

1157
01:18:01,905 --> 01:18:03,031
- <i>Crescent Riverview.</i>

1158
01:18:03,073 --> 01:18:05,439
- Hi.
I'd like a room, please.

1159
01:18:05,476 --> 01:18:07,842
- <i>When would it be for?</i>

1160
01:18:07,878 --> 01:18:09,311
- Tonight, if you've got one.

1161
01:18:40,110 --> 01:18:41,202
Come on in.

1162
01:18:51,155 --> 01:18:53,089
Would you mind if we talked?

1163
01:18:53,123 --> 01:18:56,490
- Oh-
- Please, it's important.

1164
01:19:04,501 --> 01:19:05,832
Sit down.

1165
01:19:14,411 --> 01:19:18,507
You know what the difference is
between you and me, Gavin?

1166
01:19:18,549 --> 01:19:19,880
- No.

1167
01:19:19,917 --> 01:19:22,681
- There are two differences.

1168
01:19:22,719 --> 01:19:25,779
First of all, you don't see
the world as it is.

1169
01:19:25,823 --> 01:19:28,849
This world
is a disgusting place.

1170
01:19:28,892 --> 01:19:30,985
I know this because I've seen
some of the worst

1171
01:19:31,028 --> 01:19:32,552
it has to offer.

1172
01:19:35,499 --> 01:19:37,524
- I find that hard to believe.

1173
01:19:37,568 --> 01:19:39,798
- Did you know
I was married before?

1174
01:19:42,473 --> 01:19:43,872
- No, I didn't know that, Joe.

1175
01:19:43,907 --> 01:19:45,306
- Mm-hmm.

1176
01:19:45,342 --> 01:19:48,903
A lovely wife,

1177
01:19:48,946 --> 01:19:52,211
two beautiful children,

1178
01:19:52,249 --> 01:19:53,716
great home.

1179
01:19:53,750 --> 01:19:57,049
But I couldn't stay home,
because I was drawn to sin.

1180
01:19:57,087 --> 01:19:58,816
I'd go out for a drink,
and five hours later,

1181
01:19:58,856 --> 01:20:00,187
I'd be coked out of my head

1182
01:20:00,224 --> 01:20:02,988
and in a booth in a porno shop,
or I'd get a hooker,

1183
01:20:03,026 --> 01:20:05,494
or I'd go-go gambling,

1184
01:20:05,529 --> 01:20:08,464
or pretty much whatever
you can imagine, I did.

1185
01:20:08,499 --> 01:20:11,730
And I lost it all.

1186
01:20:11,768 --> 01:20:15,329
My wife left me.

1187
01:20:15,372 --> 01:20:16,805
She caught diseases from me.

1188
01:20:16,840 --> 01:20:20,139
I lost my job.

1189
01:20:20,177 --> 01:20:22,873
I lost my children.

1190
01:20:22,913 --> 01:20:25,507
But even still, I couldn't stop.

1191
01:20:27,551 --> 01:20:29,576
I mean, so what do you think
that is?

1192
01:20:29,620 --> 01:20:32,180
You think
I'm, like, a sex addict

1193
01:20:32,222 --> 01:20:37,421
or a junkie
or a gambling addict,

1194
01:20:37,461 --> 01:20:38,450
alcoholic?

1195
01:20:38,495 --> 01:20:39,484
What?

1196
01:20:41,632 --> 01:20:43,156
- I don't know, Joe.

1197
01:20:43,200 --> 01:20:44,189
I have no idea.

1198
01:20:44,234 --> 01:20:46,794
- The answer
is none of the above.

1199
01:20:46,837 --> 01:20:49,635
I just had to have sensation.

1200
01:20:49,673 --> 01:20:55,305
I had to feel alive,
because inside, I was dying.

1201
01:20:55,345 --> 01:20:58,405
Spiritually, right?
I was lost.

1202
01:21:03,287 --> 01:21:07,189
See, I was, you know,
half an inch from death

1203
01:21:07,224 --> 01:21:09,624
when Jesus came to me.

1204
01:21:09,660 --> 01:21:10,854
I was.

1205
01:21:10,894 --> 01:21:14,022
I was lying in the gutter
and got up,

1206
01:21:14,064 --> 01:21:19,434
stumbled into a church,
and I was born again.

1207
01:21:20,871 --> 01:21:22,168
I was saved.

1208
01:21:22,206 --> 01:21:25,767
I was a new man.

1209
01:21:25,809 --> 01:21:30,143
The joy-the relief, really...

1210
01:21:32,015 --> 01:21:34,745
You have no idea how that feels.

1211
01:21:37,254 --> 01:21:39,654
About a year later,

1212
01:21:39,690 --> 01:21:43,854
the Lord, having given me
so much already,

1213
01:21:43,894 --> 01:21:47,660
He gave me Shana.

1214
01:21:47,698 --> 01:21:51,190
He brought her into the church.

1215
01:21:51,235 --> 01:21:54,466
And the moment that I saw her,

1216
01:21:54,504 --> 01:21:58,565
I knew that I loved her.

1217
01:21:58,609 --> 01:22:02,636
Then we were married
in His sight,

1218
01:22:02,679 --> 01:22:05,614
in His house.

1219
01:22:05,649 --> 01:22:07,344
And loving her was the-

1220
01:22:10,254 --> 01:22:15,214
It was such a pure love.

1221
01:22:16,994 --> 01:22:20,930
Until two nights ago.

1222
01:22:22,532 --> 01:22:24,523
When you were...

1223
01:22:24,568 --> 01:22:27,765
fucking her in your kitchen,

1224
01:22:27,804 --> 01:22:31,365
I was outside the door,
listening.

1225
01:22:31,408 --> 01:22:35,936
And I thought
of smashing down that door

1226
01:22:35,979 --> 01:22:38,743
and killing you both.

1227
01:22:39,816 --> 01:22:42,284
But I just ran away.

1228
01:22:42,319 --> 01:22:43,445
I ran away, and I did things

1229
01:22:43,487 --> 01:22:46,217
that I have not done
in a long time.

1230
01:22:46,256 --> 01:22:49,054
And when I came home,
she was asleep in there.

1231
01:22:49,092 --> 01:22:53,995
And I watched her lying there.

1232
01:22:54,031 --> 01:22:56,158
And she was smiling.

1233
01:23:02,973 --> 01:23:06,238
It's hard when we lose
someone we love,

1234
01:23:06,276 --> 01:23:07,265
isn't it?

1235
01:23:09,579 --> 01:23:11,604
- Yes, it is.

1236
01:23:11,648 --> 01:23:15,516
- So I came in here,

1237
01:23:15,552 --> 01:23:18,783
and I opened up the Bible.

1238
01:23:18,822 --> 01:23:24,226
And I read Psalm 23.

1239
01:23:24,261 --> 01:23:28,197
"The Lord is my shepherd.
I shall not want.

1240
01:23:28,231 --> 01:23:30,791
"Yea, though I walk through the
valley of the shadow of death,

1241
01:23:30,834 --> 01:23:33,394
"I will fear no evil,
for thou art with me.

1242
01:23:33,437 --> 01:23:38,841
Thy rod and thy staff,
they comfort me."

1243
01:23:38,875 --> 01:23:42,140
And I took this gun,
and I put it right here.

1244
01:23:44,614 --> 01:23:45,945
Now...

1245
01:23:47,851 --> 01:23:50,251
You think I'm still here
because I was afraid?

1246
01:23:51,455 --> 01:23:52,649
- I don't know, Joe.

1247
01:23:52,689 --> 01:23:54,657
- No.

1248
01:23:54,691 --> 01:23:58,457
I have no fear, Gavin.

1249
01:23:58,495 --> 01:24:01,328
You ever been
totally without fear?

1250
01:24:01,365 --> 01:24:03,196
- No.

1251
01:24:03,233 --> 01:24:09,365
- That's the second difference
between us.

1252
01:24:09,406 --> 01:24:11,465
I have the courage
to die for my beliefs

1253
01:24:11,508 --> 01:24:15,239
because I know where I'm going.

1254
01:24:15,278 --> 01:24:17,542
You have the courage
to die for your beliefs?

1255
01:24:19,750 --> 01:24:22,776
- I guess so, you know,
if I had to.

1256
01:24:22,819 --> 01:24:26,186
- I don't think you do.

1257
01:24:28,358 --> 01:24:29,586
But I figured out

1258
01:24:29,626 --> 01:24:32,595
I was the last person
that should die.

1259
01:24:33,764 --> 01:24:34,924
- Joe.

1260
01:24:39,970 --> 01:24:42,063
Read the marked passage.

1261
01:24:57,687 --> 01:24:59,211
- "The man
that committeth adultery

1262
01:24:59,256 --> 01:25:04,421
"with another man's wife,

1263
01:25:04,461 --> 01:25:08,090
the adulterer and the adulteress
shall surely be put to death."

1264
01:25:09,533 --> 01:25:14,266
But, Joe,
what about the New Testament?

1265
01:25:14,304 --> 01:25:16,431
Doesn't Jesus say
about an adulteress,

1266
01:25:16,473 --> 01:25:18,941
"He who is without sin
amongst you,

1267
01:25:18,975 --> 01:25:20,499
let him cast a stone at her?"

1268
01:25:20,544 --> 01:25:22,842
- That's right, and no one did,

1269
01:25:22,879 --> 01:25:26,781
because no one was without sin.

1270
01:25:26,817 --> 01:25:28,444
And Jesus said to the woman,

1271
01:25:28,485 --> 01:25:30,749
"Neither do I condemn thee.

1272
01:25:30,787 --> 01:25:32,914
Now go and sin no more."

1273
01:25:32,956 --> 01:25:34,150
- Right.

1274
01:25:38,495 --> 01:25:41,931
- Are you prepared
to sin no more?

1275
01:25:44,801 --> 01:25:46,530
Is Shana?

1276
01:25:53,243 --> 01:25:57,703
I am washed, sanctified,
and justified.

1277
01:25:57,747 --> 01:25:59,112
And if I say
I'm gonna do something,

1278
01:25:59,149 --> 01:26:00,616
you better believe I will.

1279
01:26:06,122 --> 01:26:07,646
Get out.

1280
01:26:21,037 --> 01:26:22,402
- Listen, Gavin.

1281
01:26:22,439 --> 01:26:24,771
For God's sake,
just come in here.

1282
01:26:24,808 --> 01:26:26,298
I promise I can help you.

1283
01:26:26,343 --> 01:26:28,106
- You think I want this, man?

1284
01:26:28,144 --> 01:26:29,304
- We just got five minutes left.

1285
01:26:29,346 --> 01:26:30,813
Please let me...

1286
01:26:37,854 --> 01:26:39,219
Excuse me.

1287
01:26:45,862 --> 01:26:46,851
If you were gonna kill someone

1288
01:26:46,897 --> 01:26:48,194
that had an affair
with your wife

1289
01:26:48,231 --> 01:26:49,960
and you were doing it this way,
what would you want?

1290
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:51,627
- Gavin!

1291
01:26:51,668 --> 01:26:53,033
Get down from there, man!

1292
01:26:53,069 --> 01:26:54,536
- I'd want to watch him.

1293
01:26:54,571 --> 01:26:55,697
- Me too.

1294
01:26:55,739 --> 01:26:57,400
I think I just saw something
on the ninth floor

1295
01:26:57,440 --> 01:26:58,600
at the Crescent Hotel.

1296
01:26:58,642 --> 01:27:00,041
- What are you doing?

1297
01:27:05,115 --> 01:27:06,241
- Look, for God's sake, Gavin,

1298
01:27:06,283 --> 01:27:07,545
please just come in here.

1299
01:27:07,584 --> 01:27:08,778
Let me help you.

1300
01:27:08,818 --> 01:27:10,080
- There's nothing you can do.

1301
01:27:11,855 --> 01:27:14,949
- <i>Hi. This is Shana.</i>
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

1302
01:27:14,991 --> 01:27:16,652
Beep!

1303
01:27:16,693 --> 01:27:18,684
- Fuck.

1304
01:27:27,470 --> 01:27:29,938
Shana.

1305
01:27:29,973 --> 01:27:31,372
- You know how I said
I had the courage

1306
01:27:31,408 --> 01:27:33,399
to die for my beliefs
but you didn't?

1307
01:27:33,443 --> 01:27:34,432
- Yeah.

1308
01:27:34,477 --> 01:27:35,944
- <i>You disagreed.</i>

1309
01:27:35,979 --> 01:27:37,173
- Yeah.

1310
01:27:37,213 --> 01:27:38,737
- You still think you have
the courage?

1311
01:27:38,782 --> 01:27:40,511
- Yeah, Joe,
but what does that matter?

1312
01:27:40,550 --> 01:27:41,608
- <i>Yeah, will let me tell you</i>

1313
01:27:41,651 --> 01:27:42,743
<i>what the situation is here,</i>
<i>Gavin.</i>

1314
01:27:42,786 --> 01:27:46,654
See, I've decided I'm more
of an Old Testament sort of guy.

1315
01:27:46,690 --> 01:27:49,454
But I am willing to compromise.

1316
01:27:49,492 --> 01:27:53,895
Only one of you
has to die today.

1317
01:27:53,930 --> 01:27:56,694
I have Shana
right in front of me,

1318
01:27:56,733 --> 01:28:00,134
and I have my gun
pointed at her head.

1319
01:28:00,170 --> 01:28:01,262
- Listen, Joe, whatever-

1320
01:28:01,304 --> 01:28:03,169
- Stop.
Stop.

1321
01:28:05,442 --> 01:28:08,434
Go to the Tamlacker Building.

1322
01:28:08,478 --> 01:28:11,606
There's a door around back.

1323
01:28:11,648 --> 01:28:15,448
Take the staircase
all the way up to the top.

1324
01:28:16,386 --> 01:28:18,411
On the roof,
you'll find a utility shed.

1325
01:28:21,791 --> 01:28:24,988
You get on the ledge
in front of it.

1326
01:28:27,764 --> 01:28:29,994
You stand there and think.

1327
01:28:31,468 --> 01:28:34,767
At noon, you jump,
or I put a bullet in her head.

1328
01:28:34,804 --> 01:28:38,331
Maybe you'll find God.

1329
01:28:38,375 --> 01:28:40,138
- What in the hell
is wrong with you?

1330
01:28:40,176 --> 01:28:42,644
Don't you realize if you had
told me this from the start,

1331
01:28:42,679 --> 01:28:43,668
I could've found him?

1332
01:28:43,713 --> 01:28:44,805
I could've done something.

1333
01:28:44,848 --> 01:28:46,076
- He would've killed her.

1334
01:28:46,116 --> 01:28:49,085
- How do you know he's even
capable of killing her?

1335
01:28:49,119 --> 01:28:51,747
You don't even know
what you're capable of.

1336
01:28:51,788 --> 01:28:54,848
I mean, would you kill your mom
in order to save your father

1337
01:28:54,891 --> 01:28:58,224
or kill one of your kids
in order to save another kid?

1338
01:28:58,261 --> 01:29:00,786
These are things
that we cannot know.

1339
01:29:00,830 --> 01:29:04,288
- I know what he's capable of,
Hollis.

1340
01:29:04,334 --> 01:29:06,529
I saw it in his eyes.

1341
01:29:06,569 --> 01:29:09,231
- Look, man, I am not gonna
blow smoke up your ass.

1342
01:29:09,272 --> 01:29:12,799
You are in a terrible dilemma.

1343
01:29:12,842 --> 01:29:14,639
But I swear to you,
if I was in your place-

1344
01:29:14,678 --> 01:29:16,339
- Who do your kids
think their dad is?

1345
01:29:16,379 --> 01:29:18,074
- Gavin-
- You get over it for them.

1346
01:29:18,114 --> 01:29:19,809
- Gavin, please.
Please just come in here-

1347
01:29:19,849 --> 01:29:22,010
- Where's your faith now?

1348
01:29:22,052 --> 01:29:23,610
Your wife says she loves you

1349
01:29:23,653 --> 01:29:26,850
and she did this for you, right?

1350
01:29:26,890 --> 01:29:28,289
- Why can't you have faith
in that?

1351
01:29:28,324 --> 01:29:30,690
- Why don't you just mind
your own fuckin' business?

1352
01:29:31,995 --> 01:29:34,156
Listen, man,
if you do this to me,

1353
01:29:34,197 --> 01:29:36,529
I'm gonna carry this shit
the rest of my life.

1354
01:29:36,566 --> 01:29:38,329
- Not if you do
what I want you to do.

1355
01:29:38,368 --> 01:29:39,733
- Tell Shana-
- I will not do it.

1356
01:29:39,769 --> 01:29:41,031
I will not do it.

1357
01:29:41,071 --> 01:29:43,437
If you got somethin'
that you need to tell her,

1358
01:29:43,473 --> 01:29:46,738
you climb your ass in here,
you tell her yourself!

1359
01:29:46,776 --> 01:29:48,175
You're always so rational.

1360
01:29:48,211 --> 01:29:50,179
I mean, does this sound
rational to you?

1361
01:29:50,213 --> 01:29:51,271
- <i>Whoa! Get out of here!</i>

1362
01:29:51,314 --> 01:29:52,406
- I mean, think about it.

1363
01:29:52,449 --> 01:29:56,510
What makes her life
more valuable than yours?

1364
01:29:57,287 --> 01:29:58,845
Please.

1365
01:29:58,888 --> 01:30:02,483
Gavin.

1366
01:30:02,525 --> 01:30:04,356
Just come here.

1367
01:30:04,394 --> 01:30:07,056
Just come here, man.

1368
01:30:07,097 --> 01:30:09,827
Now, Gavin, please.

1369
01:30:15,038 --> 01:30:17,063
Gavin, please come here.

1370
01:30:25,181 --> 01:30:26,478
Just come here, man.

1371
01:30:26,516 --> 01:30:29,713
- Look, I feel like
I've gotten to know you.

1372
01:30:29,753 --> 01:30:31,983
And I like you, and I'm sorry
I'm gonna have to do this.

1373
01:30:32,021 --> 01:30:33,215
- Please.

1374
01:30:33,256 --> 01:30:34,484
- But if you were standing
where I am

1375
01:30:34,524 --> 01:30:36,389
and your wife or any one
of your kids had a gun

1376
01:30:36,426 --> 01:30:37,950
to his or her head,

1377
01:30:37,994 --> 01:30:40,462
this time,
you did have time to think,

1378
01:30:40,497 --> 01:30:42,829
could anyone on Earth
stop you from jumping?

1379
01:30:42,866 --> 01:30:44,424
- I'm begging you.
Please don't do this.

1380
01:30:44,467 --> 01:30:45,729
- Here's what I want you to do.

1381
01:30:45,769 --> 01:30:47,293
- Gavin, please don't do this.

1382
01:30:47,337 --> 01:30:49,305
- I never told Shana
I loved her.

1383
01:30:49,339 --> 01:30:52,001
You tell her for me.
- I will not do it.

1384
01:30:52,041 --> 01:30:54,874
- Yes, you will.

1385
01:30:54,911 --> 01:30:56,310
Then you go home, okay?

1386
01:30:56,346 --> 01:30:58,041
- Gavin, don't you do this.

1387
01:30:58,081 --> 01:31:00,481
Please, Gavin.

1388
01:31:00,517 --> 01:31:01,643
- Fuck.
Here.

1389
01:31:01,684 --> 01:31:03,709
- Gavin, please!

1390
01:31:31,181 --> 01:31:32,478
- Freeze.
Freeze!

1391
01:31:32,515 --> 01:31:34,506
On the ground, now.
Drop it.

1392
01:32:02,345 --> 01:32:05,246
- Do you have anyone
to stay with?

1393
01:32:08,184 --> 01:32:10,880
- I think I'll try being alone
for a while.

1394
01:32:10,920 --> 01:32:13,912
Never really done that.

1395
01:32:13,957 --> 01:32:16,858
- Well, at least for tonight,
like, a friend?

1396
01:32:21,231 --> 01:32:22,892
- I guess I'll find out.

1397
01:32:26,202 --> 01:32:30,696
- Look, not that I imagine
you're doubting it,

1398
01:32:30,740 --> 01:32:34,699
but he did want me
to tell you that...

1399
01:32:34,744 --> 01:32:37,212
he loved you.

1400
01:32:43,653 --> 01:32:45,245
- Thank you.

1401
01:35:12,802 --> 01:35:15,100
Daddy!

1402
01:35:16,506 --> 01:35:18,770
- They heard
what happened today.

1403
01:35:19,442 --> 01:35:20,500
The guy on the-

1404
01:35:20,543 --> 01:35:22,704
- It was on the TV?

1405
01:35:25,081 --> 01:35:27,140
- I'm really sorry.

1406
01:35:28,551 --> 01:35:30,678
- It's okay.

1407
01:35:33,689 --> 01:35:35,714
Life goes on.

1408
01:35:43,499 --> 01:35:47,799
- So shall we say grace?

1409
01:35:47,837 --> 01:35:50,362
- No, not tonight.

1410
01:35:50,406 --> 01:35:53,239
We don't say grace tonight,

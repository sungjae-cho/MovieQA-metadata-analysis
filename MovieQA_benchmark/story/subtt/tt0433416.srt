1
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,150
<i>- Hm. What are you reading?
- Hm?</i>

2
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,836
<i>The Overcoat, by Gogol.</i>

3
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:31,711
- Gogol?
- Uh-huh.

4
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,791
Never heard of him.

5
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:41,270
Syllabus?

6
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,157
No.

7
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:47,712
<i>Just reading.
My grandfather has given me the book.</i>

8
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:03,234
- Seen much of this world?
- I went to Delhi once.

9
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:06,073
Every year I visit my grandfather
in Jamshedpur.

10
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:10,312
No, no, no, no, no. Not this world.

11
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,470
I mean England, America.

12
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,949
I was in England for two years.

13
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,235
It was like a dream.

14
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:20,153
Sparkling clean streets.

15
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,310
Nobody spitting on the road.

16
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:26,196
- Have you ever thought of going abroad?
- No.

17
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:30,432
You should. You are young. You are free.

18
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:37,589
<i>I'll tell you one thing, you
must go out and conquer the world.</i>

19
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,591
You will never regret it.

20
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:44,514
My grandfather always says
that is what books are for -

21
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:47,640
to travel without moving an inch.

22
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,598
To each his own.

23
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:53,193
<i>- Didi, why are you so late?
- Hey, Rini.</i>

24
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:07,594
<i>Go, get ready quickly.
Someone is waiting for you. Go.</i>

25
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,511
<i>Learn, Rini.</i>

26
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,755
<i>She loves to cook.
She knits very well.</i>

27
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:43,515
<i>She knitted a cardigan
in just a week.</i>

28
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:47,673
<i>And kids are crazy about her.</i>

29
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:18,034
<i>She's been learning
classical music since childhood.</i>

30
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:24,077
<i>Here she is.</i>

31
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,716
<i>- It's OK.
- It's OK.</i>

32
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,912
Uh...

33
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,515
My son has been living abroad
for the last two years.

34
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:55,911
He's in New York. He's doing
his PhD in the field of fibre optics.

35
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,673
- Hm?
- Hm!

36
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,989
Our daughter's best subject is English.

37
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:09,073
<i>Ashima, recite something for us.</i>

38
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:21,077
"I wandered lonely as a cloud

39
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:24,630
That floats on high o'er vales and hills,

40
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,757
When all at once I saw a crowd... "

41
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,479
"A host, of golden daffodils"

42
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,194
This was my father's favourite poem.

43
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:38,794
He used to read a lot, my father. Oh!

44
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,678
<i>You sit. Sit, please.</i>

45
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:48,029
My child, have you ever flown in a plane?

46
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:54,229
Will you be able to go
halfway across the world,

47
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:58,871
live in a cold city with freezing winters?

48
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:04,116
<i>Leave your house,
far from your parents?</i>

49
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:07,158
<i>You won't get tired, will you?</i>

50
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:16,154
<i>- He'll be with me, won't he?
- Huh?</i>

51
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,629
<i>You're starting a new life.</i>

52
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:34,871
<i>Take it to your heart.</i>

53
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:37,872
<i>But don't forget us.</i>

54
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:41,953
<i>It's a new life
full ofjoy and happiness.</i>

55
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,153
<i>- Let me see. Let me see.
- No, no, no.</i>

56
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:46,268
<i>Where are you?</i>

57
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,759
It is a freezing winter day outside.

58
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,708
Bread. Milk.

59
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,233
Apple. Teem.

60
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:13,790
The rest we'll buy from the Indian shop
after I come home.

61
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:17,429
<i>- You're going out?
- Yes. Three weeks are up.</i>

62
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,590
<i>Now, I have to go.</i>

63
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,270
How are you feeling?

64
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:33,156
It will take you several days to recover.
After all, you've just flown...

65
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:36,471
halfway around the world.

66
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:39,518
<i>You go and rest.
I'll bring you some tea.</i>

67
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,477
<i>Go.</i>

68
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:44,279
It is the American way.

69
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:48,319
<i>Go. Go, go. Take a rest.</i>

70
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:51,039
<i>- I don't want to.
- OK.</i>

71
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,588
<i>Then sit down. Sit.</i>

72
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:57,036
<i>Here, we have 24-hour gas. See.</i>

73
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,634
<i>You just turn this and...</i>

74
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,153
gas.

75
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:05,392
<i>Hot and cold water, too.
There are two taps.</i>

76
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:10,156
Red one and blue one. Don't confuse
between the two, you would get burned.

77
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:14,472
And you can drink water straight
from the tap, no need to boil it.

78
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:19,236
The washing machine is just down the
street. I will show you when I come home.

79
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,477
Now...

80
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,431
Once you are settled,
I will take you to my department

81
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:37,034
and introduce you to my professor here.

82
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,997
You won't believe it.

83
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:45,076
<i>In comparison to the professors
here, even our street vendors dress well.</i>

84
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,752
Just a minute.

85
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,273
No, no, no, no, no!

86
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:10,752
<i>I am very happy,
and everything here is wonderful.</i>

87
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:14,276
<i>The plane journey was long but enjoyable,</i>

88
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:16,396
<i>and I am feeling fine.</i>

89
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,311
<i>How is Rini?</i>

90
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:23,349
<i>The house is very nice -
big, with lots of windows.</i>

91
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:28,594
<i>Do you know, over here
we get gas all day and all night?</i>

92
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:37,877
These have all shrunk.
I mean, who asked you to wash my clothes?

93
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:42,078
<i>Couldn't you have waited?
Here, one dollar means eight rupees.</i>

94
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,310
We don't have so much money to buy...

95
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,391
Where are you going?

96
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,512
Ashima?

97
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:57,748
Ashima?

98
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,910
Open the door, Ashima.

99
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:11,273
I'm sorry, Ashima.

100
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,271
<i>It was my mistake.</i>

101
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:19,196
Your intention was good but it was my mistake
not to tell you. Please, open the door.

102
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:25,515
<i>My Ashima. My Ashima, dear
Ashima. Open the door, Ashima.</i>

103
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,477
<i>Open the door.</i>

104
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,629
Please?

105
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:33,511
Hey, baba.

106
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:43,670
<i>Crazy girl.</i>

107
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:48,752
<i>You won't smile? Huh?</i>

108
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:51,115
<i>No smile? No smile.</i>

109
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:55,239
<i>One, two... No smile.
No smile.</i>

110
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:01,594
I'm sorry.

111
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:09,394
Take one or three train,
from here all the way to...

112
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,391
Fulton Street.

113
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:15,359
You get out of the station, ask anybody:

114
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:18,910
<i>"Where's the Fulton fish market?"</i>

115
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:24,155
<i>Uh, and if I get lost?</i>

116
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:28,233
<i>Why are you scared?
Will I let you get lost?</i>

117
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,157
Uh...

118
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,958
<i>What's happening? Hm?</i>

119
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,991
<i>Come.</i>

120
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,188
<i>Come close to me.</i>

121
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:21,315
- Do you have a longer frock?
- What's that?

122
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,470
I mean to here.

123
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:25,596
And hide those gorgeous legs?

124
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:30,591
Here we go, let's get you under the covers
so you needn't worry.

125
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:34,190
Time those contractions.

126
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:04,749
<i>Rana? Hey, Rana!</i>

127
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:33,349
<i>Everything's OK. I checked.</i>

128
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:40,432
<i>Eyes are black like jamuns.</i>

129
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:44,600
<i>Black like hair.</i>

130
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:53,230
<i>How are you?
Everything was OK?</i>

131
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:10,954
Being rescued was the
first miracle of my life.

132
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,991
You are the second.

133
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:30,519
Mrs Ganguli? I'm Mr Wilcox.

134
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,470
You have a name for the baby?

135
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:37,120
One minute. My husband is coming.

136
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:40,272
<i>- He wants the baby's name.
- Yes, the name.</i>

137
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:43,397
We are waiting for
my wife's grandmother to choose.

138
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:45,835
Will she be here soon?

139
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:49,390
She is in India. She is
more than 85 years old.

140
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:53,917
But there is no hurry. Some of my cousins
were not named until they were six years old.

141
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,434
<i>Until then they were called
by their dak names.</i>

142
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:58,670
<i>- Dak names?
- Pet names.</i>

143
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:03,117
<i>We all have two names - one pet name,
dak name, one good name, bhalo name.</i>

144
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:08,115
In this country, a baby can't be released
from the hospital without a birth certificate

145
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,555
and a birth certificate requires a name.

146
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:14,030
How about... Baby Boy Ganguli?

147
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:16,998
Baby Boy?

148
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:19,992
Till the letter arrives.
Afterward, we can change it?

149
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:22,071
Is that what we should do?

150
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:26,153
I wouldn't
- endless red tape. Expensive, too.

151
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,231
Sleep on it.

152
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,431
Baby Boy Ganguli?

153
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:37,075
<i>Gogol...</i>

154
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:41,837
Gogolu?

155
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:45,076
What do you say?

156
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:47,799
We could call him Gogol.

157
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:54,476
Till the letter arrives. Later we could
change it on the birth certificate.

158
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:01,473
We would not be here
but for Gogol's blessings.

159
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:04,990
Hold still, hold still.

160
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:06,832
Don't move.

161
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:09,434
One, two, three.

162
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,317
Say "cheese".

163
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:20,075
<i>Look, look. Gogol. Uncle!</i>

164
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:22,958
<i>Uncle, uncle, uncle.</i>

165
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:25,838
<i>- It's just come?
- Yes.</i>

166
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:32,914
<i>- Here he is.
- Oh, my, he's so sweet.</i>

167
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:40,235
<i>Look, look. Ashima's baby, Gogol.</i>

168
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:54,188
<i>I want to go home.</i>

169
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:58,795
<i>I don't want to bring up Gogol
alone over here.</i>

170
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:04,798
Think of Gogol's future.

171
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:07,917
This is the land of opportunity, Ashima.

172
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,993
He can become whatever he wants,
study whatever he desires.

173
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:14,640
You know, options are limitless.

174
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,711
Don't you want to give him that?

175
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,597
Huh?

176
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:31,116
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

177
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,191
You're welcome.

178
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:35,271
Come on.

179
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:40,831
Leave it, leave it. Leave it. Come, come.

180
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:57,479
Don't go so far that I cannot see you.
He's too little.

181
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:19,751
<i>Welcome to suburbia, Ashokda. You have
a beautiful house. Congratulations.</i>

182
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,831
<i>Everything is from a yard sale.</i>

183
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:25,390
Ashima does not like it but I say,
"What is wrong with it?"

184
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:28,836
Even my chairman,
who lives in a huge mansion,

185
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:31,480
wears a trouser bought for fifty cents.

186
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:34,471
That is America, Ashoke.

187
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:40,114
Hey, kids, catch it.

188
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,511
<i>Gogol?</i>

189
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,397
Where are you?

190
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,756
Hey, Googly.

191
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,670
<i>Poor child.</i>

192
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:58,436
He's probably feeling very left out because
of his sister Sonia's naming ceremony.

193
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:02,957
- Is he going to be called Gogol in school?
- No. We have decided on a good name.

194
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:05,429
<i>Finally. What is it?</i>

195
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,556
Nikhil.

196
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:10,154
The all encompassing one.

197
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,879
Of course, they will it turn it into Nick.

198
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:15,190
Gogol?

199
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:17,719
Hey, Gogol.

200
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:20,268
<i>He's here.</i>

201
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:23,352
Missing your sister's ceremony, huh?

202
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:27,393
I found him.

203
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:29,471
<i>I don't like the baby.</i>

204
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:35,830
- Sonia, eat this.
- Now will be the grand finale.

205
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:38,912
Ashima, what will your baby girl's future be?

206
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,912
<i>We will see her future now.</i>

207
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:47,597
<i>- She wants everything.
- Ask her to pick up the pen.</i>

208
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:50,672
Hey, Sonia, pick up the pen.

209
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:53,228
- A female Tagore.
- Put the dollar in her hand.

210
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:55,470
Pick up something, Sonu.

211
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:58,393
<i>American girl must be rich.</i>

212
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:06,677
She's not picking anything.

213
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:16,354
So, how did you like
your first day in big school?

214
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:19,159
- Great.
- Oh.

215
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:21,231
And what is this?

216
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:31,229
"Due to your son's preference, he
will be known as Gogol in school. "

217
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:34,312
"Mrs Lapidas, Principal. "

218
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:37,117
Hm.

219
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:43,633
And what about your parents' preference?

220
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:45,756
Hm?

221
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:49,914
<i>In this country, the children decide.</i>

222
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,993
He wants to keep Gogol
and not Nikhil as his good name.

223
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,591
Fine. No big deal.

224
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:02,915
With a president named Jimmy,
there's nothing we can do.

225
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,992
As long as our kid is happy.

226
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:17,710
So late?

227
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:23,155
Hello. Hello?

228
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:28,036
<i>Hello, Ashokda?</i>

229
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:31,078
<i>Ashokda, can you hear me?</i>

230
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:34,154
<i>There's bad news, Ashokda.</i>

231
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:36,037
<i>What?</i>

232
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:39,390
<i>I cannot give this news to Didi.</i>

233
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:43,154
Don't worry, I will.

234
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:49,319
<i>He told you something
you're not telling me.</i>

235
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:02,476
Yesterday evening your father
was playing patience on his bed.

236
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:04,630
He died of a heart attack.

237
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:05,709
Ah!

238
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:08,473
<i>What? What?</i>

239
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:10,357
Baba!

240
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,795
<i>Calm, Ashima.</i>

241
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:29,872
<i>He didn't suffer much.</i>

242
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:09,475
- Come on.
- Look, baba. Gogol.

243
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:15,078
<i>- Where?
- G-o-g-o-I.</i>

244
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:17,628
<i>Very good. Very good.</i>

245
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:21,190
Come on, we'll miss the plane.
Come on, come on.

246
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:33,152
<i>- Come.
- I don't want to go.</i>

247
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:36,038
<i>I don't want to see them like that.</i>

248
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:38,588
<i>That won't do.</i>

249
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:45,112
<i>Think of your mother,
think of your brother.</i>

250
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:49,034
<i>You have to be
strong for all of them.</i>

251
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:51,111
<i>Let's go.</i>

252
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,356
Not your ordinary guy, Nikolai Gogol.

253
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:25,671
<i>Hey, Gogol, it's your namesake.</i>

254
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:29,355
Today he is respected as
one of Russia's most brilliant writers,

255
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:33,592
but in his own lifetime he was understood
by no one, least of all himself.

256
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:37,070
One might say that
he was an eccentric genius.

257
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:39,037
- Yo, Gargle, way to go.
- Shut up.

258
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:43,796
Mr Hanson, Mr Epstein, I will see you both
after class. Thank you. Out.

259
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:45,871
Come on. Out.

260
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:51,471
Thank you, gentlemen.

261
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:56,798
Now, Gogol was reputed
to be a hypochondriac.

262
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:00,156
He was deeply paranoid,
frustrated, friendless.

263
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:03,038
He never married
and he fathered no children.

264
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:09,996
Towards the end of his life, he proceeded
to commit slow suicide by starvation.

265
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:12,275
<i>Eww!</i>

266
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:14,794
Did you guys know about him
when you named me?

267
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:18,270
That he was paranoid, suicidal,
friendless, depressed?

268
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:22,512
You forgot to mention
that he was also a genius.

269
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:27,793
How could you guys name me
after someone so strange?

270
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:30,758
<i>Don't talk to your father like that.</i>

271
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:33,559
And don't call us "guys".

272
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:39,431
Sometimes when I listen to you both,
I feel I have given birth to strangers.

273
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:44,991
Just because you're graduating does not
mean you can behave like this, Gogol.

274
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,948
<i>So I'm two inches away from her.</i>

275
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:59,076
Her luscious lips part.

276
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:02,154
Just as I'm about to kiss her,

277
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:05,710
she looks at me and she says:

278
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:08,439
"What's your name?"

279
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:10,272
"Gogol Ganguli. "

280
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:14,956
- End of Seduction 101.
- Plain Jane loves your name.

281
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:19,113
- "Gogol, Gogol, I love you. "
- "Gogol!"

282
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:21,156
Don't Bogart thatjoint.

283
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:26,234
You know, of all the freaking
Russian writers in the universe...

284
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:30,349
why did they have to choose the weirdest?

285
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:33,079
What the hell's wrong with Leo or Anton?

286
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:35,879
Shit! I just want to
sit 'em down and be like:

287
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:38,872
"Man, Gogol is your favourite author,
not mine. "

288
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:41,711
- Shit!
- What?

289
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:44,553
I got that thing. Oh, shit.

290
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:49,192
<i>- Hey, where you going?
- See ya!</i>

291
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,998
Goodbye, Air India.

292
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:53,275
<i>Whoo-hoo!</i>

293
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:03,638
- I'm sorry.
- They have been here for two hours already.

294
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:06,029
Come.

295
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:08,588
- This is our son, Gogol.
- Sorry, I'm late.

296
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:13,549
Hey, Gogol. Mr and Mrs Mazumdar, they've
have just moved in to New York from London.

297
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:16,677
Wow. That's far.

298
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:19,794
- Hey, Gogol.
- Hey, Mira Masi.

299
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:22,155
I'll show you something.

300
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,800
And this is our daughter, Moushumi.

301
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:28,830
- Both the same age also.
- Oh.

302
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:32,151
- They'll have a lot in common.
- I'm sure.

303
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:34,198
Hi.

304
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:35,679
Hello.

305
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:38,433
<i>- What are you reading?
- Bonjour Tristesse.</i>

306
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:40,829
In French.

307
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:43,229
Wanna go watch some TV?

308
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:46,437
Tch! I detest American television.

309
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:52,473
Gogol, baba.
Come and sit next to your Mira Masi.

310
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:55,233
Come. Come.

311
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:59,793
Why are your eyes so red?

312
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:04,836
- Someone's envy has definitely got to you.
- I'm fine.

313
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:08,356
<i>Ashima, get me some chillies.</i>

314
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:11,432
<i>Nikhi, let me see. Give, quickly.</i>

315
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:20,868
Oh, Mira Masi. I promise you there are no
evil eyes in the United States of America.

316
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:23,269
That is what you think.

317
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:26,511
You be careful where you're going.
What is the name?

318
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:27,794
Yale.

319
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:33,514
There will be plenty of girls in this
Yale place who will want to trap you.

320
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:37,513
Have as much fun as you want but...

321
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:40,794
<i>...marry a Bengali.</i>

322
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:54,076
<i># I admit it</i>

323
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:55,832
<i># What's to say?</i>

324
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:58,669
<i># Yeah</i>

325
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:01,558
<i># I'll relive it</i>

326
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:04,231
<i># Without pain</i>

327
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:09,469
Gogol!

328
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,039
Hey, baba.

329
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:17,311
- How are you feeling now?
- I'm feeling a lot better. Thank you.

330
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:19,197
Good.

331
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:22,990
Listen.

332
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:26,868
I have never given you any presents
apart from what your mother buys,

333
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:31,238
but for your graduation,
I have something special.

334
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:34,790
<i># Oh, try and mimic</i>

335
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,871
<i># What's insane</i>

336
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:40,831
Thanks, baba.

337
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:49,234
I ordered this just for you from the
bookstore. Took four months to arrive.

338
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:51,231
<i># I got a back-street lover
on the passenger street</i>

339
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:53,675
<i># I got my hand in my pocket,
so determined, discreet</i>

340
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,637
<i># I pray</i>

341
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:58,996
<i># Once upon a time</i>

342
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:02,072
<i># I can control myself</i>

343
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:06,397
<i># Ooh, once upon a time...</i>

344
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:08,391
I hope you like it.

345
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:10,471
Very nice.

346
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,551
Thanks, baba.

347
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:17,671
Thanks again.

348
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:33,550
You know, I feel a special kinship with
Gogol. More than with any other writer.

349
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:36,716
- Do you know why?
- Yes.

350
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:39,951
Gogol's your favourite author.
I know, baba.

351
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:44,035
No, apart from that.

352
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:48,477
He spent most of his adult life
outside his homeland.

353
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,830
- Like me.
- Right.

354
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:56,277
But...

355
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,717
there...

356
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:01,631
there is another reason.

357
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:10,959
Hello?

358
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:12,629
Hm?

359
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:15,439
What's the other reason?

360
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:21,434
No other reason.

361
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:32,751
OK, good night.

362
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:34,831
Good night, baba.

363
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:44,516
<i>We all came out of Gogol's Overcoat.</i>

364
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:48,108
One day you will understand.

365
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:51,237
<i>Your attention, please.</i>

366
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:57,429
<i>Indian Airlines announces the departure
of their flight IC408 to Calcutta.</i>

367
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:03,189
<i>On behalf of Indian Airlines
and Captain Dasgupta,</i>

368
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:05,032
<i>we hope you enjoy your flight.</i>

369
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:19,236
<i>Flight IC408.</i>

370
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:49,590
<i>Ah! They've come.</i>

371
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,598
Take out the luggage.

372
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:08,796
- Gogol.
- Hi, Dadima.

373
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:17,070
<i>That's all. And for our Rini...</i>

374
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,831
Here. Earphones.

375
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:24,789
<i>Quickly,
bring two pairs of chappals from Bata.</i>

376
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:27,599
<i>Get them only from Bata.</i>

377
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:30,069
<i>Tea for you.</i>

378
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,391
It's an umbrella.

379
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:51,637
<i>Open it, see.</i>

380
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:53,517
Ah!

381
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:56,557
Whole New York in Calcutta.

382
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:05,275
- What's wrong with you?
- I want to go home.

383
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:06,918
Oh-ho!

384
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:10,151
I have something that'll cheer you up.

385
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:18,036
Here. The planner says
that there are only 89 days left to go.

386
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:24,868
What is wrong with you? Are you hot?
Have some ancient air conditioning.

387
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:26,951
Go away!

388
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:40,233
<i>Give me one kilo of tomatoes.
Give me the good ones.</i>

389
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:44,752
<i>See, that one there is not good.</i>

390
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:48,110
You are going out?

391
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:50,509
- Jogging.
- Jogging?

392
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:54,991
- Running, on the street. I'm in training.
- Training?

393
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:56,672
Yep.

394
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:59,228
Don't worry, Dadima. I'm not gonna go far.

395
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:02,118
<i>Oh, my God. Chotu. Chotu.</i>

396
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:03,758
<i>Coming.</i>

397
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:08,709
<i>Go with him. He's on the road.
Stay close to him.</i>

398
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:12,110
<i>I know, I know. I'm going.</i>

399
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:14,390
Oh, good morning. Gogol!

400
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:22,149
<i>Gogol, babu!
Move, move. Gogol!</i>

401
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:24,993
<i>Gogol, babu! I'm a fat man.</i>

402
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:34,480
Stop. Stop.

403
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:36,357
Stop.

404
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:42,237
<i>Your grandmother
told me to go with you.</i>

405
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:46,870
Babu follow Chotu.
No... Chotu follow Babu.

406
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:50,475
<i>- They sent you to follow me?
- Yes.</i>

407
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:52,835
<i>My heart's beating fast.</i>

408
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:54,194
Heart?

409
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:58,436
- Chotu die.
- Don't die. Want to go back?

410
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:26,238
There is something I always wanted
to ask you but never had the courage.

411
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:31,794
All those years ago,
why did you say yes to me?

412
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:35,588
You were the best of the lot.

413
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:38,151
Huh?

414
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:42,719
Better than the widower with four children,

415
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:45,598
and the cartoonist with one arm.

416
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:50,873
I also liked your shoes.

417
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:55,470
Oh, OK, OK.

418
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:05,160
You want me to say, "I love you"?

419
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:08,038
Like the Americans?

420
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:09,633
<i>Yes.</i>

421
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:14,433
<i>Yes.</i>

422
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:31,515
Stop sulking. You look really great
in that outfit. It suits you.

423
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:34,478
Shut up.

424
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:37,996
Why don't you get in, my American sahib?
Sonia can sit on my lap.

425
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:41,629
No. Because being pulled by
another human being is feudal,

426
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:45,474
and I don't want to be
part of something like that because...

427
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:50,551
Ma, stop. It's embarrassing me.

428
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:53,750
Who can guess where we're going tomorrow?

429
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:55,751
- Another relative's house?
- No.

430
00:45:55,840 --> 00:46:00,231
- The Botanical Gardens for the 100th time.
- To Agra. To see the Taj Mahal.

431
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:02,914
- Are you serious? You're not kidding?
- Really?

432
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,991
- That's awesome, Ma.
- Oh, my God!

433
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:07,674
<i>It's a wonder of the world.</i>

434
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:35,509
<i>- We should have taken a plane.
- Everything will be fine.</i>

435
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:37,591
<i>What will be fine?</i>

436
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:42,715
<i>Baba, how far?</i>

437
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:44,791
It's right here.

438
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:49,671
<i>Let's go, let's go.</i>

439
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:28,630
I've always wanted to come here with you.

440
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:41,113
Just imagine how much Shah Jahan must
have loved Mumtaz to make this for her.

441
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:46,194
Other husbands
also love their wives, Ashima.

442
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:50,558
Only we cannot afford to build Taj Mahal.

443
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:55,118
Guess what.

444
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:59,079
- I think I'm gonna major in architecture.
- What about engineering?

445
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:05,156
Come on, baba. Architecture has everything.
It's got engineering, drawing, aesthetics.

446
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:07,956
Our family Shah Jahan.

447
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:09,192
Look. "Gangrene. "

448
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:13,231
What the?

449
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:19,075
- Can you believe this?
- I'll catch the racist punk who did that.

450
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:21,674
- Don't be upset.
- Frigging welcome home.

451
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:23,751
Just some kids having fun.

452
00:50:36,120 --> 00:50:39,476
So, I've been thinking a lot about my name.

453
00:50:42,680 --> 00:50:45,069
"Gogol" is fine on my high school diploma

454
00:50:45,160 --> 00:50:50,154
but can you imagine "Gogol"
on a résumé or a credit card after that?

455
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:54,798
What are you trying to say?

456
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:57,838
I'd like to change my name
back to my good name.

457
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:03,593
What is done is done.
Now "Gogol" has become your good name.

458
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:06,148
It's too complicated now. You're too old.

459
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:09,232
And, anyway, you have
only yourself to blame.

460
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:11,834
It's my fault because I was four years old?

461
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:13,911
That's right, Gogol.

462
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:19,670
Anything is possible in America.

463
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:21,751
Do as you wish.

464
00:51:51,080 --> 00:51:52,957
An excellent choice, sir.

465
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:15,912
I'm home.

466
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,673
- Hi, Nick.
- Hello.

467
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:21,115
Hi, Lydia. How're you doing?

468
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:24,158
- Good. Have you got it?
- Yep.

469
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:29,390
Where's my girl?
Where's my Master of Fine Arts?

470
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:32,199
- Congratulations.
- Thank you, Daddy.

471
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:38,949
Thank you all so much for coming.
This means so much to me.

472
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:41,076
Drink. Celebrate.

473
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:45,199
Beep beep. Excuse me. I'm sorry.

474
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:46,713
Cake.

475
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:49,075
- I still can't believe it's over.
- Hey.

476
00:52:49,160 --> 00:52:51,355
Hi.

477
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:53,431
- Nick...
- Open it.

478
00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:04,078
- Do you like it?
- Yeah, it's beautiful.

479
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:06,390
<i>Hello.</i>

480
00:53:07,080 --> 00:53:12,393
I want you to meet the young Indian
architect who has so captured Maxine's heart.

481
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:16,359
This is Pam Burton, a dear college friend,
and this is Nikhil Ganguli.

482
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:18,829
- How do you do?
- Maxine, look who's here.

483
00:53:18,920 --> 00:53:22,151
- It's very nice to meet you.
- You as well.

484
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:24,834
Now, how old were you
when you moved to America?

485
00:53:24,920 --> 00:53:26,592
I was actually born in New York.

486
00:53:26,680 --> 00:53:29,148
I once had a girlfriend who went to India.

487
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:31,549
Came back thin as a rail.

488
00:53:31,640 --> 00:53:34,677
- I'm sure.
- I was horribly envious of her.

489
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:41,873
I think your parents want you
to marry a nice Indian girl.

490
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:44,428
I don't care what they want.

491
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:49,271
This is what I want.

492
00:54:09,560 --> 00:54:13,519
Sally gave them to me before
anybody else could check them out, huh?

493
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:17,195
<i>Ah! Reading Chekhov.</i>

494
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:21,273
What perks I get from my wife, the librarian.

495
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:27,232
<i>- What are you, blind?
- Today, huh?</i>

496
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:32,391
<i>Drive fast.</i>

497
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:34,789
You have to learn to drive faster.

498
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:38,793
<i>Don't talk to me. I will have an accident.</i>

499
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:42,668
<i>If you keep on driving like this,
you will have an accident.</i>

500
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:55,714
<i>Everything's fine, Mom.</i>

501
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:57,597
- Why are you calling me?
- Hey, hon.

502
00:54:57,680 --> 00:55:00,240
<i>Because you're
not at your apartment.</i>

503
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:02,788
<i>You are never at your apartment, Gogol.</i>

504
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:06,236
In the middle of the night I have called
and you are not there.

505
00:55:06,320 --> 00:55:10,199
<i>I am, Ma. I need my sleep.
I turn off the phone.</i>

506
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:14,077
<i>- Gogol, are you there?
- Yeah, yeah. I'm here. I'm here.</i>

507
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:16,515
I want you to come home next Saturday.

508
00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:19,433
Then you can come with us
to the airport the next day.

509
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:22,751
Baba is going to teach in Ohio
for six months. You remember?

510
00:55:22,840 --> 00:55:26,276
I remember. But what's the big deal?
He's only going to Cleveland.

511
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:30,353
<i>- Sonia's not coming home.
- Sonia lives in California, Gogol.</i>

512
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:33,351
<i>I can't come home that weekend.</i>

513
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:39,228
I'm going on a vacation with my girlfriend.
Her parents have a place in Oyster Bay.

514
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:43,158
<i>Mom?</i>

515
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:56,078
Mind if we go see my parents
on the way to Oyster Bay?

516
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:58,628
- You mean I'd finally get to meet them?
- Mm-hm.

517
00:55:58,720 --> 00:56:00,870
I'd love to, baby.

518
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:02,951
Oh, that's too much.

519
00:56:06,051 --> 00:56:08,042
I'm back.

520
00:56:10,611 --> 00:56:14,889
You know, he's willing to go on vacation
with someone else's parents,

521
00:56:14,971 --> 00:56:17,166
but not to see his own.

522
00:56:17,251 --> 00:56:22,644
Forget it, this is America.
Soon as the kids turn 16, they're gone.

523
00:56:24,531 --> 00:56:29,002
I lost the company of my parents
when I first came to this country.

524
00:56:30,451 --> 00:56:33,807
Now I feel I'm losing
my family all over again.

525
00:56:34,811 --> 00:56:39,282
Besides, what kind of a girl
is called Max, huh?

526
00:56:39,371 --> 00:56:41,363
Maybe it's a boy.

527
00:56:44,131 --> 00:56:47,487
There are things you should know.
No kissing, no holding hands.

528
00:56:47,571 --> 00:56:51,086
My parents are not Lydia and Gerald.
I've never seen them touch.

529
00:56:51,171 --> 00:56:53,366
- A little depressing.
- A little bit.

530
00:56:53,451 --> 00:56:56,170
You really want to forget all this stuff.

531
00:56:56,251 --> 00:56:58,685
What? Why're you getting truffles?

532
00:56:58,771 --> 00:57:00,921
- They won't like them, will they?
- No.

533
00:57:01,011 --> 00:57:03,605
Come on, Nick, everyone loves truffles.

534
00:57:04,691 --> 00:57:06,807
<i>Ma, we're here.</i>

535
00:57:07,731 --> 00:57:09,847
Ma.

536
00:57:09,931 --> 00:57:11,808
Hi.

537
00:57:11,891 --> 00:57:14,166
Ma, this is Maxine. Max, this is my mother.

538
00:57:14,251 --> 00:57:18,767
Hello, Ashima. It's so
nice to finally meet you.

539
00:57:18,851 --> 00:57:20,489
Hm.

540
00:57:20,571 --> 00:57:23,608
- These are for you and Ashoke.
- Oh.

541
00:57:24,251 --> 00:57:26,162
There was no need.

542
00:57:26,251 --> 00:57:28,685
Thank you. Please come in.

543
00:57:28,771 --> 00:57:30,762
- Come.
- Thank you.

544
00:57:33,171 --> 00:57:35,162
Please sit.

545
00:57:36,491 --> 00:57:38,482
I will get drinks.

546
00:57:39,971 --> 00:57:43,600
- It's nice. This is where you grew up?
- Yeah.

547
00:57:55,531 --> 00:58:00,446
Nikhil's father is upstairs
with the man from the alarm company.

548
00:58:00,531 --> 00:58:03,887
- Why are we getting a security system?
- It was your father's idea.

549
00:58:03,971 --> 00:58:05,882
Now that I will be on my own.

550
00:58:05,971 --> 00:58:10,408
You know, even in good areas like this,
these days there are crimes.

551
00:58:10,491 --> 00:58:13,688
Ashima, I've been admiring
what you're wearing.

552
00:58:13,771 --> 00:58:17,127
<i>- Is this a kantha?
- Oh, yes.</i>

553
00:58:17,211 --> 00:58:20,886
I grew up with fabrics.
My mother curates textiles at the Met.

554
00:58:20,971 --> 00:58:23,769
- The Met?
- The Metropolitan Museum of Art.

555
00:58:23,851 --> 00:58:29,244
Remember? I took you there. It's the museum
with all the steps and the Egyptian temple.

556
00:58:29,331 --> 00:58:33,085
I remember. My father was also an artist.

557
00:58:33,171 --> 00:58:37,801
That painting you're seeing there?
That is his painting.

558
00:58:37,891 --> 00:58:40,849
Ah, it's nice.

559
00:58:40,931 --> 00:58:44,480
So it will be installed tomorrow, all right?

560
00:58:46,011 --> 00:58:48,571
- I'll give you a receipt.
- It's really lovely.

561
00:58:50,011 --> 00:58:52,002
Thank you, Mr Robbins.

562
00:58:53,691 --> 00:58:56,364
<i>- Hey, baba.
- Hey.</i>

563
00:58:56,451 --> 00:58:59,409
This is Maxine. Max, this is my father.

564
00:58:59,491 --> 00:59:01,959
- Hello.
- Hello, Ashoke.

565
00:59:07,171 --> 00:59:09,844
- How are you?
- Fine.

566
00:59:10,531 --> 00:59:12,328
Fine.

567
00:59:19,051 --> 00:59:22,839
This is the best Indian
food I've ever tasted.

568
00:59:22,931 --> 00:59:26,526
Nikhil's mother has been
cooking for the past two days.

569
00:59:26,611 --> 00:59:28,841
It's better than this boy here makes.

570
00:59:33,371 --> 00:59:34,850
<i>Oh...</i>

571
00:59:36,411 --> 00:59:38,561
I forgot the ice cream.

572
00:59:42,971 --> 00:59:45,929
Nikhil, come with me to Briar's, will you?

573
00:59:46,011 --> 00:59:49,128
- Sure.
- I'll come with you.

574
00:59:49,211 --> 00:59:53,841
Why don't you stay and keep Nikhil's mother
company? We'll be back in no time. Yes?

575
00:59:53,931 --> 00:59:55,728
OK.

576
01:00:00,331 --> 01:00:05,803
<i>I wanted to tell you something
before I leave for my semester in Ohio.</i>

577
01:00:05,891 --> 01:00:08,405
It is about your name.

578
01:00:08,491 --> 01:00:11,051
- My name?
- Gogol.

579
01:00:12,811 --> 01:00:15,450
There is a reason for it, you know.

580
01:00:15,531 --> 01:00:18,807
I know. Gogol's your favourite author.
I remember.

581
01:00:19,811 --> 01:00:22,120
<i>It is more than that.</i>

582
01:00:23,171 --> 01:00:25,162
It was...

583
01:00:26,171 --> 01:00:30,528
1974, when I was a student in Calcutta.

584
01:00:32,531 --> 01:00:38,003
<i>Every year I would take the train
to visit my grandfather in Jamshedpur.</i>

585
01:00:40,451 --> 01:00:43,887
<i>I carried one book with me
to read on the journey.</i>

586
01:00:45,411 --> 01:00:48,483
- Gogol?
- Yes.

587
01:00:49,331 --> 01:00:51,322
<i>The Overcoat.</i>

588
01:00:52,211 --> 01:00:56,966
<i>So on the train, late at night,
a Mr Ghosh befriended me.</i>

589
01:00:57,051 --> 01:01:00,930
<i>He kept trying to persuade me to leave India.</i>

590
01:01:01,531 --> 01:01:05,365
<i>And I just wanted to get back to my book.</i>

591
01:01:05,451 --> 01:01:09,330
My grandfather always says
that is what books are for -

592
01:01:09,411 --> 01:01:12,528
to travel without moving an inch.

593
01:01:14,891 --> 01:01:18,327
And that's when it happened.

594
01:02:11,051 --> 01:02:13,690
<i>There's no life here. Let's go.</i>

595
01:02:19,331 --> 01:02:22,880
<i>No, wait. That man, he's alive.
The book. He's moving.</i>

596
01:02:36,891 --> 01:02:41,248
<i>I kept hearing
Ghosh's voice in my head.</i>

597
01:02:41,651 --> 01:02:48,329
<i>Pack a pillow and blanket. See the
world. You will never regret it.</i>

598
01:02:54,011 --> 01:02:58,402
That is how I came to America
and you got your name.

599
01:03:06,171 --> 01:03:09,561
Come, Maxine will be waiting for you.

600
01:03:17,171 --> 01:03:21,005
Baba, is that what you think of
when you think of me?

601
01:03:22,091 --> 01:03:24,559
Do I remind you of that night?

602
01:03:28,371 --> 01:03:31,090
Not at all.

603
01:03:31,171 --> 01:03:34,959
You remind me of everything that followed.

604
01:03:36,051 --> 01:03:41,683
Every day since then has been a gift, Gogol.

605
01:03:58,851 --> 01:04:03,208
- Samosas for the journey.
- Thank you. Thank you so much.

606
01:04:03,291 --> 01:04:05,964
- It was lovely to meet you.
- Bye, Ma.

607
01:04:06,051 --> 01:04:08,042
Same here.

608
01:04:09,011 --> 01:04:11,969
Remember to check in on
your mother now and again.

609
01:04:12,051 --> 01:04:15,646
- OK, baba. Call to let us know
that you've arrived safely.

610
01:04:15,731 --> 01:04:18,291
- I will.
- Drive safely, Gogol.

611
01:04:21,691 --> 01:04:26,048
- What did your dad just call you?
- I'll explain later.

612
01:04:30,691 --> 01:04:34,650
<i>I would never have guessed
that your parents are so different.</i>

613
01:04:34,731 --> 01:04:36,608
<i># I don't need no 9-mil Glock</i>

614
01:04:36,691 --> 01:04:38,363
<i># These hands are deadly guns</i>

615
01:04:38,451 --> 01:04:40,009
<i># From smokin', drinkin', being a thug</i>

616
01:04:40,091 --> 01:04:42,241
<i># I sip Hynotyq from a coffee mug</i>

617
01:04:42,331 --> 01:04:44,003
<i># I keep a healthy state of mind</i>

618
01:04:44,091 --> 01:04:46,844
<i># I only drink and drive at night</i>

619
01:04:47,171 --> 01:04:50,527
- Ah! We're here.
- This is beautiful.

620
01:04:50,611 --> 01:04:53,967
- You like?
- Yeah. It's perfect New England Victorian.

621
01:04:54,051 --> 01:04:56,485
Thus spake my architect.

622
01:04:56,571 --> 01:04:59,961
- We got truffles.
- Hey, Gerald. Hey, Lydia.

623
01:05:00,051 --> 01:05:04,283
<i>- Hey! Hi. Hi!
- Hi, Nick.</i>

624
01:05:07,411 --> 01:05:11,962
<i>This is my absolute favourite place
on earth. I can map my life here.</i>

625
01:05:15,051 --> 01:05:17,645
You know, I envy you this place.

626
01:05:17,731 --> 01:05:20,882
My parents never felt the need
to be so far away from things.

627
01:05:20,971 --> 01:05:24,441
- Where did you guys go?
- On the road.

628
01:05:24,531 --> 01:05:29,207
In rented vans we would travel with Bengali
families to see other Bengali families,

629
01:05:29,291 --> 01:05:31,009
inevitably getting lost.

630
01:05:31,091 --> 01:05:35,130
Dad's mulling over AAA maps on the side
of the road. When it was time to eat,

631
01:05:35,211 --> 01:05:40,080
we would pull over at some rest stop and pull
out an Indian meal from a bunch of tiffins,

632
01:05:40,171 --> 01:05:42,639
when all I really wanted was a McDonald's.

633
01:05:42,731 --> 01:05:45,928
It was kind of fun, though,
if you didn't know anything else.

634
01:05:47,171 --> 01:05:49,446
Well, you're here now.

635
01:05:52,491 --> 01:05:58,487
So Ms Maxine, MFA, what's it gonna be -
the museum job or the book on Mantegna?

636
01:06:00,371 --> 01:06:03,807
I don't wanna think about it right now.

637
01:06:04,211 --> 01:06:06,202
I wanna be free.

638
01:06:11,011 --> 01:06:13,479
He never called.

639
01:06:13,571 --> 01:06:15,607
I'm sure they're fine.

640
01:06:19,851 --> 01:06:25,562
It is you I am worried about.
You know, being alone, for the first time.

641
01:06:26,891 --> 01:06:29,200
No big deal.

642
01:06:29,291 --> 01:06:31,759
As the children always say to me.

643
01:06:37,491 --> 01:06:40,210
It is easy for them, Ashima.

644
01:06:40,291 --> 01:06:42,282
They grew up here.

645
01:06:47,251 --> 01:06:51,039
You will be alone too. How will you manage?

646
01:06:54,811 --> 01:06:57,769
But I will see you every third weekend.

647
01:07:11,571 --> 01:07:15,644
I wish you would change your mind
and come with me.

648
01:07:20,451 --> 01:07:22,248
Hm?

649
01:07:27,371 --> 01:07:29,362
<i>Leave it.</i>

650
01:08:41,491 --> 01:08:43,721
<i>That was Ratliff?</i>

651
01:08:43,811 --> 01:08:49,807
<i>I do have a number for a G Ratliff in
Oyster Bay, but I'm afraid it's unlisted.</i>

652
01:08:55,771 --> 01:08:58,046
Happy birthday, Gogol.

653
01:08:58,131 --> 01:08:59,120
Ah!

654
01:08:59,211 --> 01:09:01,441
- Happy birthday, Nick.
- Thank you.

655
01:09:02,091 --> 01:09:04,605
<i>Make a wish.</i>

656
01:09:04,691 --> 01:09:07,285
<i>Thanks, you guys. Very nice.</i>

657
01:10:03,651 --> 01:10:06,085
<i>- Hello?
- Hello, Ashima.</i>

658
01:10:06,171 --> 01:10:09,083
<i>I was just thinking of you.</i>

659
01:10:09,171 --> 01:10:14,199
<i>OK, listen.
That thing that the children gave...</i>

660
01:10:14,291 --> 01:10:17,169
Ashima, I am in Cleveland General Hospital.

661
01:10:17,251 --> 01:10:20,766
<i>Why? What happened?</i>

662
01:10:20,851 --> 01:10:24,082
I don't know. My stomach's
been bothering me since morning.

663
01:10:24,171 --> 01:10:27,686
<i>I was invited by some
Bengali students for dinner...</i>

664
01:10:27,771 --> 01:10:30,080
Then take an Alka-Seltzer.

665
01:10:30,171 --> 01:10:33,163
<i>I did. It didn't help.</i>

666
01:10:33,251 --> 01:10:38,041
I came to the emergency room because
all the doctors' offices are closed today.

667
01:10:38,131 --> 01:10:40,599
<i>Who drove you there?</i>

668
01:10:40,691 --> 01:10:43,046
No one. I am here on my own.

669
01:10:44,771 --> 01:10:47,160
<i>Really, it's not so bad.</i>

670
01:10:48,171 --> 01:10:53,199
I wish I had come with you. I was also
so selfish, only thinking about myself.

671
01:10:53,291 --> 01:10:54,849
Ashima.

672
01:10:55,931 --> 01:10:59,765
<i>Don't worry. It's nothing.</i>

673
01:10:59,851 --> 01:11:02,490
<i>OK. What does the doctor say?</i>

674
01:11:04,091 --> 01:11:07,879
I'm waiting to see him.
There's a long line. Very long line.

675
01:11:10,731 --> 01:11:13,086
<i>And don't worry.</i>

676
01:11:13,171 --> 01:11:14,763
I am feeling better already.

677
01:11:15,851 --> 01:11:18,524
<i>- Huh?
- All right.</i>

678
01:11:18,611 --> 01:11:20,761
And I'll call you when I get home.

679
01:11:20,851 --> 01:11:22,648
<i>OK.</i>

680
01:11:55,611 --> 01:12:00,639
<i>This is Professor Ganguli.
Kindly leave a message.</i>

681
01:12:08,691 --> 01:12:10,409
Yes.

682
01:12:10,491 --> 01:12:12,959
G for green.

683
01:12:13,051 --> 01:12:14,769
A for apple.

684
01:12:14,851 --> 01:12:16,921
N for Nancy.

685
01:12:17,011 --> 01:12:20,083
G for God. U for umbrella.

686
01:12:20,171 --> 01:12:21,604
L for letter.

687
01:12:21,691 --> 01:12:23,647
I for India.

688
01:12:23,731 --> 01:12:26,450
I have already spelt my name five times.

689
01:12:26,531 --> 01:12:30,080
<i>I'm just gonna have
to put you on hold, ma'am.</i>

690
01:12:35,371 --> 01:12:38,044
<i>Sorry for the wait.
To whom am I speaking?</i>

691
01:12:38,131 --> 01:12:41,919
Ashima Ganguli. Ashoke Ganguli's wife.
Who I'm speaking to?

692
01:12:42,011 --> 01:12:46,243
<i>I'm sorry, ma'am, I'm the intern
who first examined your husband.</i>

693
01:12:46,331 --> 01:12:48,606
I have been holding on for half an hour.

694
01:12:48,691 --> 01:12:52,730
Is my husband still there or has he gone?
He said he will phone me.

695
01:12:52,811 --> 01:12:55,962
<i>I'm very sorry, ma'am.
We've been trying to reach you.</i>

696
01:12:56,051 --> 01:13:01,250
<i>The patient, your husband, Ashoke Ganguli,
passed away at 5:35pm.</i>

697
01:13:04,211 --> 01:13:06,008
<i>Hello?</i>

698
01:13:07,771 --> 01:13:10,126
It is a mistake.

699
01:13:10,211 --> 01:13:14,363
He was not there for an emergency.
Only for stomachache.

700
01:13:14,451 --> 01:13:20,208
<i>Your husband had a massive heart attack.
All attempts to revive him failed.</i>

701
01:13:20,291 --> 01:13:24,762
<i>Is there anyone in the Cleveland area
who can identify...</i>

702
01:15:15,011 --> 01:15:18,560
That's why the Blur Building's my favourite.
- It's beautiful.

703
01:15:18,651 --> 01:15:20,130
- Hi.
- Hi.

704
01:15:20,211 --> 01:15:23,726
<i>- Jessie?
- Come here, Jessie.</i>

705
01:15:23,811 --> 01:15:29,807
Nick, your mother called for you twice.
Thanks, I'll give her a buzz in the morning.

706
01:15:31,131 --> 01:15:32,928
Hello?

707
01:15:34,091 --> 01:15:36,730
Nick, it's your sister this time.

708
01:15:39,891 --> 01:15:41,882
Hello. Sonia?

709
01:17:38,691 --> 01:17:43,685
<i>I take 20 rounds every morning
before going to work.</i>

710
01:18:14,371 --> 01:18:16,362
I'm sorry, baba.

711
01:18:28,091 --> 01:18:30,559
<i># When I was young
I thought that life was about muscle</i>

712
01:18:30,651 --> 01:18:32,801
<i># But it's really all about
surviving and struggle</i>

713
01:18:32,891 --> 01:18:34,961
<i># On the block I learned life and death</i>

714
01:18:35,051 --> 01:18:37,565
<i># Sometimes it's hard to breathe
so I fight for breath</i>

715
01:18:37,651 --> 01:18:39,846
<i># And where I'm from
you don't know right from left</i>

716
01:18:39,931 --> 01:18:42,081
<i># Too many obstacles, so I watched my step</i>

717
01:18:42,171 --> 01:18:44,765
<i># Yeah, that's just the way I live</i>

718
01:18:44,851 --> 01:18:46,648
Baba?

719
01:18:47,851 --> 01:18:52,083
<i># Cos I'm the chosen one
The torch forever passed from old to young</i>

720
01:18:52,171 --> 01:18:56,562
<i># I've been on the ground for years This
life's about pain, ain't no time for tears</i>

721
01:18:56,651 --> 01:18:58,403
<i># Yeah, man, I came from nothing</i>

722
01:18:58,491 --> 01:19:01,164
<i># I kept on hustling and now I'm something</i>

723
01:19:01,251 --> 01:19:03,924
<i># But the pain's...</i>

724
01:19:28,651 --> 01:19:30,607
<i>Ma.</i>

725
01:19:30,691 --> 01:19:32,488
Gogol.

726
01:19:47,651 --> 01:19:50,643
<i>You didn't have to do this.</i>

727
01:19:52,451 --> 01:19:54,601
<i>I wanted to.</i>

728
01:20:32,731 --> 01:20:34,767
Excuse me, have you seen Nick Ganguli?

729
01:20:34,851 --> 01:20:38,400
Oh, he's over here. Somewhere.

730
01:20:38,971 --> 01:20:42,281
So tragic about Ashoke. Him, going like that.

731
01:20:42,371 --> 01:20:43,850
I'm so sorry.

732
01:20:49,451 --> 01:20:53,490
<i>- Panditji namaste, is bhabhi OK?
- Yes.</i>

733
01:20:53,571 --> 01:20:55,209
- Hey.
- How are you?

734
01:20:55,291 --> 01:20:58,249
Good. Thanks for bringing my stuff.

735
01:20:58,331 --> 01:20:59,923
<i>Gogol.</i>

736
01:21:00,011 --> 01:21:02,161
<i>Get some oil from the kitchen.</i>

737
01:21:02,251 --> 01:21:04,446
Excuse me.

738
01:21:04,531 --> 01:21:07,841
The ceremony is about to begin.
Do you want to sit?

739
01:21:07,931 --> 01:21:10,001
<i>Thank you.</i>

740
01:21:47,811 --> 01:21:51,360
So when are you coming back to the city?

741
01:21:51,451 --> 01:21:53,760
I don't know.

742
01:21:53,851 --> 01:21:57,082
They've given me a month. More if I want.

743
01:21:58,811 --> 01:22:00,802
I miss you.

744
01:22:01,891 --> 01:22:04,883
I know how hard this must be for you.

745
01:22:06,051 --> 01:22:11,045
But you guys can't stay
with your mother forever. You know that.

746
01:22:15,651 --> 01:22:17,403
Listen,

747
01:22:17,491 --> 01:22:23,487
I really, really, really, want to come
to India with you to scatter the ashes.

748
01:22:25,651 --> 01:22:27,642
It's a family thing.

749
01:22:28,731 --> 01:22:31,643
I thought we were family, Nick.

750
01:22:33,571 --> 01:22:35,687
You are certainly part of mine.

751
01:22:40,411 --> 01:22:42,720
I have so many regrets, Max.

752
01:22:47,331 --> 01:22:49,128
You're bound to.

753
01:22:50,931 --> 01:22:56,608
Listen, why don't we still go away
for New Year's, like we planned?

754
01:22:58,771 --> 01:23:02,480
It might do you good
to get away from all this.

755
01:23:03,691 --> 01:23:05,682
I don't want to get away.

756
01:23:14,011 --> 01:23:16,571
What do you want from me, Nick?

757
01:23:17,691 --> 01:23:23,129
I'm trying to be here for you, but it's
like I don't even know you any more.

758
01:23:26,411 --> 01:23:28,641
Max, this is not about you.

759
01:23:33,531 --> 01:23:35,920
<i>Go carefully.</i>

760
01:23:37,411 --> 01:23:40,960
Maxine, we will all miss him, you know.

761
01:24:01,091 --> 01:24:03,082
<i>- Your name?
- Gogol.</i>

762
01:24:03,171 --> 01:24:05,446
<i>- Your father's name?
- Ashoke.</i>

763
01:24:12,651 --> 01:24:14,607
<i>- Your name?
- Ashima.</i>

764
01:24:14,691 --> 01:24:17,000
<i>- Your husband's name?
- Ashoke.</i>

765
01:25:22,651 --> 01:25:24,881
Gogol, baba.

766
01:25:24,971 --> 01:25:27,883
Maybe we should
let bygones be bygones now.

767
01:25:27,971 --> 01:25:30,485
What do you mean?

768
01:25:30,571 --> 01:25:33,039
Make up with Maxine.

769
01:25:34,811 --> 01:25:37,644
Ma, you never liked her, did you?

770
01:25:37,731 --> 01:25:40,245
That is not the point, Gogol.

771
01:25:40,331 --> 01:25:45,689
The point is that now
you should move on with your life.

772
01:25:45,771 --> 01:25:51,323
By the time I was your age, I had already
celebrated my tenth wedding anniversary.

773
01:25:51,411 --> 01:25:54,767
This is America, Ma.
We'll have twins when we're 60.

774
01:25:54,851 --> 01:25:57,729
Oh, Gogol, very funny.

775
01:25:59,051 --> 01:26:02,760
Uh, do you remember Moushumi Mazumdar?

776
01:26:03,851 --> 01:26:06,763
"I detest American television. "

777
01:26:06,851 --> 01:26:11,879
Don't be so rude. You think your accents
don't sound funny to other people?

778
01:26:11,971 --> 01:26:15,964
Poor thing. Terrible, terrible tragedy.

779
01:26:16,051 --> 01:26:20,920
She was supposed to have been married,
but it was cancelled at the last minute.

780
01:26:21,491 --> 01:26:25,006
The invitation cards were sent out,
the hall was booked, even.

781
01:26:25,531 --> 01:26:28,523
She's also in New York.
Alone, doing her PhD.

782
01:26:30,651 --> 01:26:33,882
I told her parents,
"Don't worry. Gogol will call her. "

783
01:26:33,971 --> 01:26:36,280
<i>Hey, hey, Ma.</i>

784
01:26:37,331 --> 01:26:39,925
You don't have time
for one cup of tea, Gogol?

785
01:26:41,251 --> 01:26:44,243
Her parents came to baba's funeral.
This is the least we can do.

786
01:26:44,331 --> 01:26:45,844
OK, time out.

787
01:26:47,171 --> 01:26:51,449
Let's say that I take her out to tea, OK?
Then what? What are we gonna talk about?

788
01:26:51,531 --> 01:26:53,601
- She doesn't even speak.
- Only reads.

789
01:26:53,691 --> 01:26:56,763
- Weird French stuff, Ma.
- Bye, Ma. Later, Gogol.

790
01:26:56,851 --> 01:26:58,842
See you later.

791
01:27:04,611 --> 01:27:06,567
- This is her number.
- Ma...

792
01:27:06,651 --> 01:27:10,929
Call her if you want.
Don't call her if you don't want.

793
01:27:11,411 --> 01:27:14,005
OK, thank you.

794
01:27:19,051 --> 01:27:21,087
<i>Nikhil.</i>

795
01:27:21,171 --> 01:27:22,604
Yes.

796
01:27:23,691 --> 01:27:25,807
As opposed to Gogol?

797
01:27:25,891 --> 01:27:27,324
Yes.

798
01:27:29,211 --> 01:27:32,009
- Excuse me. Single malt, please.
- OK.

799
01:27:34,571 --> 01:27:37,768
- I've never done this before.
- What's that?

800
01:27:38,771 --> 01:27:41,410
Gone out on a blind date
engineered by my mom.

801
01:27:41,491 --> 01:27:43,766
It's not a blind date exactly.

802
01:27:43,851 --> 01:27:47,161
- No?
- No, we sort of know each other in a way.

803
01:27:47,251 --> 01:27:51,722
- Here you go.
- I don't remember our ever talking, really.

804
01:27:53,611 --> 01:27:55,886
Actually, neither do I.

805
01:27:57,971 --> 01:28:01,008
Does your family still live in
the same house I used to visit?

806
01:28:01,091 --> 01:28:03,047
Yeah.

807
01:28:03,131 --> 01:28:09,206
I remember the kitchen. It
had these very blue cupboards.

808
01:28:09,291 --> 01:28:12,010
Yeah, those are still there.

809
01:28:19,211 --> 01:28:22,806
I was sorry to hear about your father.

810
01:28:22,891 --> 01:28:25,086
How's your mother getting along?

811
01:28:25,171 --> 01:28:30,165
She's all right. Sonia's been
living with her, so that helps.

812
01:28:34,891 --> 01:28:39,123
Why did you leave Paris? Wouldn't you
rather study French literature in France?

813
01:28:39,211 --> 01:28:41,805
I moved here for love.

814
01:28:41,891 --> 01:28:44,803
Surely you know about
my prenuptial disaster?

815
01:28:44,891 --> 01:28:46,449
Not really.

816
01:28:46,531 --> 01:28:52,322
Well, you ought to. Every other Bengali
living on the East Coast does.

817
01:28:54,051 --> 01:28:59,364
So, should we make our mothers happy
and see each other again?

818
01:28:59,451 --> 01:29:01,521
Maybe.

819
01:29:01,611 --> 01:29:03,522
- Give me a call.
- OK.

820
01:29:21,091 --> 01:29:23,730
I know why he went to Cleveland.

821
01:29:26,411 --> 01:29:29,403
He was teaching me how to live alone.

822
01:29:43,291 --> 01:29:45,282
<i># Bonjour, monsieur</i>

823
01:29:47,251 --> 01:29:49,481
<i># Bonjour, madame</i>

824
01:29:49,571 --> 01:29:54,008
So of course my mother is appalled
that I'm not cooking you Indian food.

825
01:29:54,091 --> 01:29:56,241
You told her I was coming over?

826
01:29:56,331 --> 01:30:00,802
She called today. What about you?
Have you been giving your mother updates?

827
01:30:00,891 --> 01:30:03,280
Sort of.

828
01:30:03,371 --> 01:30:06,169
Oh, God, I need to add more liquid.

829
01:30:10,011 --> 01:30:12,320
- You all right?
- God!

830
01:30:12,411 --> 01:30:17,405
Yeah. Could you please help me
with my glasses? Take them off and...

831
01:30:27,371 --> 01:30:29,760
<i># Comment allez-vous, monsieur?</i>

832
01:30:31,051 --> 01:30:33,042
<i># Bien, merci
Et vous-même?</i>

833
01:30:40,971 --> 01:30:45,567
<i>- God, did I really say that?
- You sure as hell did.</i>

834
01:30:45,651 --> 01:30:47,562
No wonder you never talked to me.

835
01:30:47,651 --> 01:30:51,803
I tried. You were the one who used
to treat me like an untouchable.

836
01:30:54,171 --> 01:30:56,765
Where'd you get so sexy?

837
01:30:57,771 --> 01:31:00,239
- Paris.
- Paris.

838
01:31:03,411 --> 01:31:08,610
After years of convincing myself
I'd never have a lover,

839
01:31:08,691 --> 01:31:11,251
I began to have affairs.

840
01:31:11,891 --> 01:31:13,882
How many?

841
01:31:18,651 --> 01:31:21,040
- How many what?
- Lovers.

842
01:31:24,531 --> 01:31:26,522
You don't wanna know.

843
01:31:35,771 --> 01:31:39,286
But you must understand.
Without fire, this ceremony is invalid.

844
01:31:39,371 --> 01:31:44,809
I'm sorry, sir. I cannot allow you to light
a fire anywhere within the hotel premises.

845
01:32:24,171 --> 01:32:27,561
<i>"I wandered lonely as a cloud</i>

846
01:32:27,651 --> 01:32:31,360
That floats on high o'er vales and hills,

847
01:32:31,451 --> 01:32:34,124
When all at once I saw a crowd

848
01:32:34,811 --> 01:32:37,086
<i>A host, of golden daffodils"</i>

849
01:32:40,171 --> 01:32:42,321
You're next, Sonia. Cutie.

850
01:33:29,251 --> 01:33:31,048
Mm-mm-mm?

851
01:34:25,051 --> 01:34:28,327
<i>Leave me alone.
Leave me.</i>

852
01:34:28,411 --> 01:34:30,641
<i>This marriage cannot happen.</i>

853
01:34:41,691 --> 01:34:45,001
101 from the Bannerjee family.

854
01:34:45,091 --> 01:34:50,165
OK. That brings the total to 7,035.

855
01:34:50,251 --> 01:34:55,200
- Not bad, Mr Ganguli.
- I'd say we made a killing, Mrs Ganguli.

856
01:34:55,291 --> 01:34:58,886
Hold it, hold it.
Ms Mazumdar is the name.

857
01:35:04,531 --> 01:35:07,284
We've already discussed this.

858
01:35:07,371 --> 01:35:11,125
Yeah, but I thought, you know, both names?

859
01:35:11,211 --> 01:35:13,771
Do you know how many letters that is?

860
01:35:13,851 --> 01:35:16,843
Lmagine spelling that over the phone.

861
01:35:19,171 --> 01:35:23,369
I've begun to publish under my name.
No one would know me.

862
01:35:27,371 --> 01:35:29,362
Come on, Nikhil.

863
01:35:30,851 --> 01:35:34,446
What if somebody asked you
to change your name?

864
01:35:35,451 --> 01:35:37,646
I already have, remember?

865
01:35:39,371 --> 01:35:43,364
Forget it.
I was just being silly, Ms Mazumdar.

866
01:35:48,291 --> 01:35:50,646
- It's our anniversary.
- So we'll celebrate.

867
01:35:50,731 --> 01:35:53,245
I wish we didn't have to go.
Tonight of all nights.

868
01:35:53,331 --> 01:35:57,449
- We promised.
- No, no. We didn't promise. You promised.

869
01:35:57,531 --> 01:36:01,922
- Bought you a gift. Have you bought mine?
- I'm not buying it. I'm making it.

870
01:36:02,011 --> 01:36:06,323
I'm designing a dream house for you,
so you're just gonna have to wait.

871
01:36:07,931 --> 01:36:10,650
So we're thinking "Prescott".

872
01:36:11,091 --> 01:36:14,401
- Sorry. Prescott? Why?
- It's a family name.

873
01:36:14,491 --> 01:36:19,565
What does it mean?
A name should mean something.

874
01:36:21,211 --> 01:36:23,327
What does "Moushumi" mean?

875
01:36:23,411 --> 01:36:25,606
A damp southwesterly breeze.

876
01:36:25,691 --> 01:36:30,162
Stop worrying. If he doesn't like
his name, he can always change it.

877
01:36:30,251 --> 01:36:32,765
I'd never change my name.
It's my grandmother's.

878
01:36:32,851 --> 01:36:36,400
- Nikhil changed his.
- Really?

879
01:36:36,491 --> 01:36:40,882
What do you mean, he changed his name?
Nikhil, it wasn't the name he was born with.

880
01:36:40,971 --> 01:36:43,360
What name were you born with?

881
01:36:45,091 --> 01:36:46,570
Gogol.

882
01:36:48,931 --> 01:36:50,728
<i>- As in The Overcoat?.
- Yes.</i>

883
01:36:50,811 --> 01:36:55,123
Ah, I get it. Nikolai Gogol.

884
01:36:55,211 --> 01:36:56,849
Exactly.

885
01:36:56,931 --> 01:37:00,480
What in the world made
your parents choose that name?

886
01:37:01,491 --> 01:37:04,369
My father was a fan.

887
01:37:29,411 --> 01:37:32,130
What I told you about my name was personal.

888
01:37:33,291 --> 01:37:35,009
Nobody cares.

889
01:37:35,091 --> 01:37:38,845
It's notjust some joke. And for you
to bring it up in front of these people...

890
01:37:38,931 --> 01:37:41,399
These people happen to be my friends.

891
01:37:42,571 --> 01:37:47,281
You know, I had a life before I met you.
You can't wish away my past.

892
01:38:18,451 --> 01:38:20,885
You know I can't read French.

893
01:38:20,971 --> 01:38:24,281
It's an offer to teach, at the Sorbonne.

894
01:38:28,051 --> 01:38:31,487
Don't worry. I turned it down.

895
01:38:31,571 --> 01:38:37,567
I'm going to be a good Bengali housewife
and make samosas every Thursday from scratch.

896
01:38:46,451 --> 01:38:50,000
It's so hard to know what to do sometimes.

897
01:38:50,091 --> 01:38:54,050
I was looking at this Joseph Campbell book
the other day,

898
01:38:54,131 --> 01:38:57,089
and he says when you feel lost,

899
01:38:57,171 --> 01:39:00,925
you should close your eyes
and think of when you were most happy.

900
01:39:01,011 --> 01:39:02,888
Not thrilled.

901
01:39:02,971 --> 01:39:05,849
Just deeply happy.

902
01:39:05,931 --> 01:39:08,923
It's called "following your bliss".

903
01:39:10,211 --> 01:39:12,202
You wanna try it?

904
01:39:17,931 --> 01:39:19,728
Well?

905
01:39:22,291 --> 01:39:24,759
Ashima, are you all right?

906
01:39:28,411 --> 01:39:31,050
I've been thinking of leaving.

907
01:39:32,051 --> 01:39:34,281
Is that very selfish of me?

908
01:39:36,651 --> 01:39:41,566
You know, I thought now that
the children are both well settled.

909
01:40:10,051 --> 01:40:13,248
<i>Un jour, j'espère que
tu tomberas sur ce livre,</i>

910
01:40:14,531 --> 01:40:17,250
<i>et que tu te souviendras de moi.</i>

911
01:40:18,171 --> 01:40:20,048
<i>Ton Pierre.</i>

912
01:40:33,171 --> 01:40:38,723
You don't know how happy I am that both
my children have found their life partners.

913
01:40:40,331 --> 01:40:43,482
You don't mind that Ben's not Indian?

914
01:40:43,571 --> 01:40:45,801
Times have changed.

915
01:40:45,891 --> 01:40:50,282
No, I don't mind.
He's a very good boy, you know.

916
01:40:50,371 --> 01:40:52,487
And he makes Sonia very happy.

917
01:40:53,291 --> 01:40:55,566
She's following her bliss.

918
01:40:55,651 --> 01:40:58,927
You've been reading Joseph Campbell.

919
01:41:08,611 --> 01:41:11,045
<i>Ah, c'est toi.</i>

920
01:41:11,691 --> 01:41:14,000
<i>Je cuisine des samosas avec ma belle-mère.</i>

921
01:41:14,091 --> 01:41:16,651
<i>Et toi?</i>

922
01:41:16,731 --> 01:41:19,723
<i>A tout à I'heure. Bisous.</i>

923
01:41:24,451 --> 01:41:29,127
- Can't believe my sister's getting married.
- You better believe it, Goggles.

924
01:41:29,211 --> 01:41:31,088
<i>I have something to say.</i>

925
01:41:31,171 --> 01:41:34,846
Gogol, I did not want
to tell you on the phone.

926
01:41:34,931 --> 01:41:37,889
I have decided to sell the house.

927
01:41:37,971 --> 01:41:41,930
I am going to do what your father and I
had always planned.

928
01:41:42,011 --> 01:41:45,606
Six months in India and six months here,
with all of you.

929
01:41:46,291 --> 01:41:49,203
Then I can go and start
my singing again in Calcutta.

930
01:41:49,291 --> 01:41:52,567
That is if any guru wants
a 45-year-old student.

931
01:41:52,651 --> 01:41:55,165
Of course he will.

932
01:41:55,251 --> 01:41:57,685
I want to be free.

933
01:41:57,771 --> 01:42:00,410
<i>- Like your name.
- What do you mean?</i>

934
01:42:00,491 --> 01:42:04,370
"Ashima" means "without borders, limitless".

935
01:42:18,931 --> 01:42:21,809
<i>- Mo.
- No Mo. Your ma.</i>

936
01:42:21,891 --> 01:42:23,119
Hey, Ma, what's up?

937
01:42:23,211 --> 01:42:27,443
<i>- Gogol, there's a buyer for the house.
- Are they meeting your price?</i>

938
01:42:27,531 --> 01:42:30,125
<i>- Yes.
- Then do it, Ma.</i>

939
01:42:30,211 --> 01:42:33,442
<i>I have told them they will have
to wait until after Christmas.</i>

940
01:42:33,531 --> 01:42:35,886
<i>- Both of you are coming?
- Of course.</i>

941
01:42:35,971 --> 01:42:38,769
<i>It will be the last party at Pemberton Road.</i>

942
01:42:38,851 --> 01:42:41,001
I know.

943
01:42:51,011 --> 01:42:53,002
I don't see it.

944
01:42:57,091 --> 01:43:01,084
- So, this year...
- Mm-hm?

945
01:43:01,171 --> 01:43:05,244
...they're renting a house
in the Pyrenees for the summer,

946
01:43:05,331 --> 01:43:07,208
and I told them we mightjoin them.

947
01:43:07,291 --> 01:43:10,727
Astrid and Donald for an entire summer?
Can't.

948
01:43:10,811 --> 01:43:14,201
But the Pyrenees are so beautiful.
Pierre says it's possibly...

949
01:43:14,291 --> 01:43:16,282
Who's Pierre?

950
01:43:28,771 --> 01:43:31,001
Are you having an affair?

951
01:43:34,811 --> 01:43:36,802
Are you?

952
01:43:40,731 --> 01:43:42,722
Who is he?

953
01:43:44,691 --> 01:43:47,080
Someone I've known a long time.

954
01:43:47,171 --> 01:43:49,366
Why?

955
01:43:52,971 --> 01:43:57,840
I saw myself becoming my mother.
I saw myself stuck.

956
01:44:03,171 --> 01:44:06,447
Maybe it's not enough
that we're both Bengali.

957
01:44:12,051 --> 01:44:14,963
That's not why I love you.

958
01:44:33,611 --> 01:44:36,683
So, when are you giving us the good news?

959
01:44:36,771 --> 01:44:39,444
Just because your mother's going,
don't forget us.

960
01:44:39,531 --> 01:44:42,967
Yes. You must come over.
You should not feel shy.

961
01:44:43,051 --> 01:44:47,124
We're your family also and we're still here.
- Thanks.

962
01:44:47,211 --> 01:44:49,486
I am never gonna remember all these names.

963
01:44:49,571 --> 01:44:53,723
It's all right. You don't have to. Just
call everyone "auntie", you'll be fine.

964
01:44:53,811 --> 01:44:55,802
Where's Moushumi?

965
01:45:01,731 --> 01:45:04,609
<i>Ashima, morals, morals.</i>

966
01:45:06,891 --> 01:45:10,201
You are not far wrong if you think...

967
01:45:15,891 --> 01:45:19,600
And considering our evolutionary stage...

968
01:45:24,971 --> 01:45:27,531
About morals we care a hang...

969
01:46:19,291 --> 01:46:22,169
<i>We all came out of Gogol's Overcoat.</i>

970
01:46:24,931 --> 01:46:27,399
One day you will understand.

971
01:46:39,611 --> 01:46:41,841
- Hey, Googly.
- Hey, Ma.

972
01:46:46,211 --> 01:46:48,202
And baba?

973
01:46:51,011 --> 01:46:53,730
Everything is OK?

974
01:46:53,811 --> 01:46:56,371
Between Moushumi and you, hm?

975
01:47:02,771 --> 01:47:05,569
Ma, Moushumi found someone else.

976
01:47:09,051 --> 01:47:13,283
Some... some old boyfriend.
A French guy named Pierre.

977
01:47:16,611 --> 01:47:21,605
For once somebody else's name
bothered me more than my own.

978
01:47:23,891 --> 01:47:25,882
It is all my fault.

979
01:47:27,691 --> 01:47:30,251
- I'm sorry, Gogol.
- Ma...

980
01:47:31,771 --> 01:47:34,239
Ma, it has nothing to do with you.

981
01:47:35,731 --> 01:47:39,770
We're different people.
We wanted different things.

982
01:47:39,851 --> 01:47:42,001
I will not go back to India now.

983
01:47:42,091 --> 01:47:44,082
I cannot go.

984
01:47:44,171 --> 01:47:46,162
You have to go.

985
01:47:46,251 --> 01:47:48,242
Listen to me.

986
01:47:48,771 --> 01:47:53,561
You know, I know that I'm supposed
to be devastated everybody's gone, but...

987
01:47:53,651 --> 01:47:59,726
I know this is gonna sound crazy, but for the
first time in my life, I actually feel free.

988
01:48:01,731 --> 01:48:03,528
Look.

989
01:48:04,851 --> 01:48:07,490
Look what I found.

990
01:48:08,051 --> 01:48:11,407
It's baba's graduation gift
from high school.

991
01:48:11,491 --> 01:48:13,209
See.

992
01:48:13,291 --> 01:48:15,407
<i>For Gogol Ganguli.</i>

993
01:48:15,491 --> 01:48:20,929
<i>The man who gave you his name
from the man who gave you your name.</i>

994
01:48:21,011 --> 01:48:24,083
There are no accidents, Gogol.

995
01:48:24,171 --> 01:48:26,162
Baba made you find it.

996
01:48:27,371 --> 01:48:29,362
He is with us.

997
01:48:44,211 --> 01:48:49,080
Don't go so far that I cannot see you.
He's too little.

998
01:48:49,171 --> 01:48:51,162
Jump. Jump.

999
01:48:53,251 --> 01:48:55,526
<i>Are you listening?</i>

1000
01:49:09,491 --> 01:49:13,530
Oh, baba, the camera. It is in the car.

1001
01:49:22,411 --> 01:49:24,925
All this way and no picture.

1002
01:49:25,011 --> 01:49:26,967
Huh?

1003
01:49:27,051 --> 01:49:28,962
<i>What should we do?</i>

1004
01:49:29,891 --> 01:49:34,089
We just have to remember it, then. Huh?

1005
01:49:34,171 --> 01:49:36,321
Will you remember this day, Gogol?

1006
01:49:36,411 --> 01:49:39,130
How long do I have to remember it?

1007
01:49:41,291 --> 01:49:43,930
Remember it always.

1008
01:49:44,011 --> 01:49:47,321
Remember that you and I made the journey,

1009
01:49:47,411 --> 01:49:53,327
and we went together to a place
where there was nowhere left to go.

1010
01:50:05,371 --> 01:50:09,364
<i>For 25 years,
I missed my life in India.</i>

1011
01:50:11,771 --> 01:50:15,127
And now I will miss my life here,

1012
01:50:15,571 --> 01:50:19,849
and all of you who became my family.

1013
01:50:23,091 --> 01:50:26,481
I will miss living with my daughter,

1014
01:50:27,491 --> 01:50:30,642
and the surprising friendship we've found.

1015
01:50:31,851 --> 01:50:36,845
I will miss phoning my son
at all times of day or night.

1016
01:50:38,611 --> 01:50:41,569
And I will miss this country,

1017
01:50:42,771 --> 01:50:47,891
in which I had grown
to know and love my husband.

1018
01:50:49,571 --> 01:50:53,564
And though his ashes
are scattered in the Ganges,

1019
01:50:55,411 --> 01:50:59,609
it is here in this house, in this town,

1020
01:51:00,171 --> 01:51:02,685

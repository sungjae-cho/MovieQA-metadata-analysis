1
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:15,000


2
00:01:12,322 --> 00:01:17,744
His friends would say
"Stop whining." they've had enough of that

3
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:22,331
His friends would say
"Stop pining, there's other girls to look at"

4
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:28,713
They've tried to set him up
With Tiffany and Indigo

5
00:01:28,881 --> 00:01:34,844
But there's something about Mary
That they don't know

6
00:01:35,012 --> 00:01:37,722
Mary

7
00:01:38,348 --> 00:01:43,019
There's just something about Mary

8
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:51,235
Well, his friends say
"Look, life's no fairy tale"

9
00:01:51,403 --> 00:01:56,699
That he should have some fun
He's suffered long enough

10
00:01:56,867 --> 00:02:02,872
Well, they may know
About domestic and imported ale

11
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:08,169
But they don't know a thing about love

12
00:02:08,462 --> 00:02:14,258
Well, his friends would say
He's dreaming and living in the past

13
00:02:14,426 --> 00:02:20,389
But they've never fallen in love
So his friends need not be asked

14
00:02:20,557 --> 00:02:27,563
His friends would say, "Be reasonable"
His friends would say, "Let go"

15
00:02:29,024 --> 00:02:35,905
But there's something about Mary
That they don't know

16
00:02:36,073 --> 00:02:38,366
Mary

17
00:02:39,243 --> 00:02:43,830
There's just something about Mary

18
00:02:54,633 --> 00:02:57,885
When I was 16 years old. I fell in love.

19
00:03:00,138 --> 00:03:01,180
Hey, Renise.

20
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:04,350
Hey.

21
00:03:04,643 --> 00:03:06,686
So. What's up?

22
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:09,855
Cool.

23
00:03:14,236 --> 00:03:20,199
So I was wondering, I don't know
if maybe you wanted to and... Or not.

24
00:03:20,367 --> 00:03:22,243
If you don't want to, you don't have to.

25
00:03:22,411 --> 00:03:25,538
I just wondered if maybe
you were going to the prom. And...

26
00:03:25,706 --> 00:03:30,918
Or if you felt like that,
maybe you'd wanna go with me.

27
00:03:31,086 --> 00:03:35,006
Or, I mean. Whatever. If you didn't...

28
00:03:36,675 --> 00:03:39,093
Did you take that bio test?
Because that was, like...

29
00:03:39,261 --> 00:03:41,929
I heard this rumor that this guy I like
was gonna ask me...

30
00:03:42,097 --> 00:03:44,682
...so I'm gonna wait and see
what happens there.

31
00:03:46,018 --> 00:03:48,269
That sounds great. Yeah.

32
00:03:49,271 --> 00:03:50,938
Okay.

33
00:03:54,443 --> 00:03:58,863
- So is that, like, a yes or a no or...?
- I thought I made it perfectly clear.

34
00:03:59,031 --> 00:04:01,699
If everything else falls apart...

35
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:03,618
...maybe.

36
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:07,622
I'm gonna hold you to that.

37
00:04:13,045 --> 00:04:16,130
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Mary.

38
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:21,510
I wonder who she's going with.

39
00:04:24,765 --> 00:04:25,973
Her name was Mary.

40
00:04:26,141 --> 00:04:29,935
She moved to our little Rhode Island town
from Minnesota two years earlier.

41
00:04:32,648 --> 00:04:34,065
What a fox.

42
00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:37,193
I heard she's going
with some guy named Woogie.

43
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:42,740
- Who?
- Big guy. Goes to Barrington High.

44
00:04:42,908 --> 00:04:46,952
Woogie from Bore-ington High?
Sounds like a loser.

45
00:04:47,496 --> 00:04:48,663
Loser?

46
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:54,502
Woogie's only, like. All-state football
and basketball and fucking valedictorian.

47
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:58,673
I heard he got a scholarship to Princeton,
but he's going to Europe first to model.

48
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:02,468
Yeah? I was thinking of doing that.

49
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:05,346
Sorry.

50
00:05:05,514 --> 00:05:07,640
Have you...? Have you seen my baseball?

51
00:05:07,808 --> 00:05:10,726
No, no. Sorry, man. Haven't seen it.

52
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:15,064
Have you seen my baseball?

53
00:05:15,232 --> 00:05:16,816
- No.
- Sorry.

54
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:21,028
Hey, check it out.

55
00:05:21,196 --> 00:05:22,863
Have you seen my baseball?

56
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:27,868
Hey, buddy. Come here.
I think I know where your ball is.

57
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:31,789
- You seen my baseball?
- Yeah, yeah. I seen it.

58
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:35,501
You see that girl over there?

59
00:05:36,503 --> 00:05:39,755
She has it.
except she doesn't call it a baseball.

60
00:05:39,923 --> 00:05:42,299
She's got another name for it.

61
00:05:46,138 --> 00:05:48,139
Nice muffs.

62
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:52,143
- Have you seen my wiener?
- What?

63
00:05:53,979 --> 00:05:55,563
Have you seen my wiener?

64
00:05:55,731 --> 00:05:58,899
- What the hell did you just say, buddy?
- Wiener?

65
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:01,986
Get your hand off my car.
What the hell did you just say to me?

66
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:04,989
My wiener.

67
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:08,909
You fucking son of a bitch.
I'm gonna fucking kick your ass.

68
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:12,163
- Come on, get up, fat boy. Let's go.
- Hey, Smokey, take it easy.

69
00:06:12,998 --> 00:06:15,207
- Who the fuck are you?
- The guy's not all there.

70
00:06:16,585 --> 00:06:19,295
Get out of my face. Come on.
You want the first punch?

71
00:06:19,463 --> 00:06:22,006
- Yeah! Fight, fight. Fight!
- Fight. Fight. Fight!

72
00:06:22,507 --> 00:06:25,509
What's the matter with you? Stop it.

73
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:29,263
- You okay, Warren?
- Mary, have you seen my baseball?

74
00:06:29,431 --> 00:06:30,973
No, I haven't seen your baseball.

75
00:06:31,141 --> 00:06:34,769
What are you doing leaving the yard?
You're not supposed to leave by yourself.

76
00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:36,771
- You know him?
- He's my brother.

77
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:38,314
I'm her brother.

78
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:41,192
- Warren.
- I didn't realize. You know?

79
00:06:41,359 --> 00:06:44,904
- You ought to tell him to watch his mouth.
- Jerk.

80
00:06:46,865 --> 00:06:51,035
- Are you okay?
- Oh. Yeah, I'm fine.

81
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:53,162
You okay?

82
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:56,832
Thanks, Ted.

83
00:06:58,084 --> 00:07:00,294
I couldn't believe it. She knew my name.

84
00:07:00,462 --> 00:07:03,506
Some of my best friends
didn't know my name.

85
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:07,635
I think that Joe Montana is, like.
the most underrated quarterback.

86
00:07:07,803 --> 00:07:10,137
I mean. He should've been
a first-round draft pick.

87
00:07:10,305 --> 00:07:14,016
Look what he did at Notre Dame.
It's so ridiculous.

88
00:07:14,184 --> 00:07:17,645
- Exactly.
- I'm telling you, this year. It's the 49ers.

89
00:07:17,813 --> 00:07:21,273
- 49ers.
- All the way.

90
00:07:22,234 --> 00:07:26,570
- Piggyback ride. Piggyback.
- Warren, stop it. Leave Ted alone.

91
00:07:26,738 --> 00:07:29,740
No, that's okay, I'll do it.
I mean. If you think he can hold me.

92
00:07:29,908 --> 00:07:33,536
Are you kidding me? He's 230 pounds.
he can hold you. You don't have to.

93
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:37,248
No, it's okay. I got a little disc thing,
but it's all right. Here we go.

94
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:39,792
Giddyup. Warren. There we go.

95
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:43,921
- That's fun, huh. Warren?
- He's a real Clydesdale, isn't he?

96
00:07:44,089 --> 00:07:46,674
Yeah. Warren. Bucking bronco. Okay.

97
00:07:46,842 --> 00:07:48,801
My turn now. My turn.

98
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:52,847
- Okay, well. I don't...
- It's okay, Ted. You don't have to.

99
00:07:53,682 --> 00:07:56,475
- Giddyup. Giddyup.
- That's fun.

100
00:07:57,769 --> 00:08:00,354
That's fun. Huh, Warren?

101
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:11,657
That was fun.

102
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:13,742
- He's only 230. huh?
- Yeah.

103
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:17,538
- I'm in the yard now. I'll hide.
- Okay, go hide.

104
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:19,623
- He's got a lot of energy.
- Yeah.

105
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:23,002
- He's great. I have a lot of fun with him.
- Yeah.

106
00:08:24,087 --> 00:08:27,798
- Thanks for walking us back.
- Yeah, no problem.

107
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:31,886
- I'm just gonna... I'm gonna...
- So are you going to the prom?

108
00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:39,643
- I think proms are dumb.
- I thought maybe we could go together.

109
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:43,063
Oh, you're gonna go with. Like,
a bunch of people. or...?

110
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:45,065
Yeah. If you want a designated driver...

111
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:47,526
No, no. I mean you and me.

112
00:08:47,694 --> 00:08:50,905
Like. We could go together.
The two of us.

113
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:55,576
- You and me?
- Yeah.

114
00:08:59,748 --> 00:09:02,249
Well, is that a yes or a no?

115
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:05,669
- Sure. All right.
- Good.

116
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:07,588
Cool.

117
00:09:07,756 --> 00:09:11,967
I'm gonna take Warren back inside.
I'll see you at school.

118
00:09:12,135 --> 00:09:14,470
- Bye.
- Cool. Catch you back at school.

119
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:20,601
From that moment on. The guys at school
looked at me in a whole new light.

120
00:09:20,769 --> 00:09:22,728
You're a fucking liar.

121
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:26,732
Do you expect us to believe
that you're going to the prom with Mary?

122
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:29,276
What's so crazy about that?

123
00:09:29,444 --> 00:09:32,863
Oh, yeah, dirt bud.
and I'm going with Cyndi Lauper.

124
00:09:33,031 --> 00:09:36,617
- What happened to Woogie?
- She said she broke up with him.

125
00:09:36,785 --> 00:09:41,580
- That he was getting weird on her.
- I got 20 bucks that says you're full of shit.

126
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:43,832
- Why not make it a hundred?
- Rock on.

127
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,126
- I'm in.
- Me too.

128
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:13,737
I've paid him enough money. I'm not paying
until the job gets done. He can kiss my ass.

129
00:10:14,197 --> 00:10:15,406
What the hell do you want?

130
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:25,249
I'm Ted Stroehmann.
I'm here to take Mary to the prom.

131
00:10:25,417 --> 00:10:26,667
Prom?

132
00:10:26,835 --> 00:10:30,087
Mary went to the prom 20 minutes ago
with her boyfriend, Woogie.

133
00:10:30,255 --> 00:10:32,256
- Woogie?
- Woogie.

134
00:10:34,718 --> 00:10:36,135
I see.

135
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:40,472
Charlie, you are so mean.

136
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:44,727
This is Mary's stepfather. Charlie.
I'm Sheila. Her mother.

137
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:48,522
Ted, don't pay attention to anything
he says. He's a laugh a minute.

138
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:49,982
That's very funny.

139
00:10:50,692 --> 00:10:53,360
I'm just having a little fun with the guy.
It's prom night.

140
00:10:53,528 --> 00:10:54,945
Woogie's got a sense of humor.

141
00:10:58,033 --> 00:10:59,950
Oh, hey. Hi, Warren.

142
00:11:00,118 --> 00:11:04,079
Listen, once he gets into that MTV,
he'll be there for quite a while.

143
00:11:05,874 --> 00:11:10,127
Here she comes.
Oh, honey. You look beautiful.

144
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:18,052
Shit, look at that.
You better be careful. Boy.

145
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:35,027
Hi. Ted.

146
00:11:35,653 --> 00:11:39,615
Hi. Mary. You look really pretty.

147
00:11:39,783 --> 00:11:42,076
Thanks. I like your colors.

148
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:45,913
Oh, thanks.
The guy said it was tan and taupe.

149
00:11:46,915 --> 00:11:49,958
Poor Ted's been getting it both barrels
from the wisenheimer here.

150
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:52,920
Dad. You haven't been busting Ted's chops,
have you?

151
00:11:53,088 --> 00:11:56,090
I was just fucking with him, right. Ted?
You know.

152
00:11:57,383 --> 00:12:01,595
- Hey, Warren, did you say hi to Ted?
- About 10 times.

153
00:12:01,763 --> 00:12:02,846
Okay.

154
00:12:03,014 --> 00:12:05,891
Hey, Warren,
I think I found your baseball.

155
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:09,228
- You've seen my baseball?
- Well. If it's a big white one?

156
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:15,692
With little red stitching?

157
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:16,902
Yup, it is.

158
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:20,197
Then I think I saw it
right behind your ear.

159
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,409
Warren. Warren. Warren. Hold it.

160
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:27,121
Get up, boy. Hey. Warren.

161
00:12:28,123 --> 00:12:29,832
Be careful, man.

162
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:31,750
- Get up. Man.
- Warren.

163
00:12:31,918 --> 00:12:33,544
Let go of him. Get down from there.

164
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:35,879
- Hey, Ted, what are you doing, man?
- Ted. Ted.

165
00:12:36,047 --> 00:12:37,798
Warren. Put him down now.

166
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:42,219
- What the hell are you doing?
- Here, here. Mary. Come around here.

167
00:12:42,387 --> 00:12:43,804
This is my house. Here.

168
00:12:43,972 --> 00:12:48,559
- Okay, sweetheart. Okay.
- It's okay, Warren. It's okay. Here you go.

169
00:12:48,726 --> 00:12:51,895
- What's the matter with you?
- I was trying to give him the baseball.

170
00:12:52,063 --> 00:12:55,691
- Baseball? What baseball?
- I had a baseball. I know he likes baseball.

171
00:12:55,859 --> 00:12:58,318
- What baseball?
- There was a... It's right...

172
00:12:58,486 --> 00:13:00,112
There was a baseball here. I swear.

173
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:04,158
I brought him a baseball.
and I was just trying to give him a present.

174
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:07,035
- Are you yelling at me in my own house?
- No.

175
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:09,621
Don't make me have to open
a can of whup-ass on you.

176
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:12,791
Ted, I should have told you.
He has a thing about his ears.

177
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:15,335
You all right. Warren?

178
00:13:16,004 --> 00:13:18,463
Honey, your strap's broken.

179
00:13:19,549 --> 00:13:20,674
You're right.

180
00:13:20,842 --> 00:13:23,302
Hey, Ted, I'm just gonna go upstairs
real quick. Okay?

181
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:24,678
I just need two minutes.

182
00:13:24,846 --> 00:13:27,681
- I gotta fix my dress.
- I'll help you, honey.

183
00:13:28,016 --> 00:13:30,517
- Yeah, yeah.
- Can I use your bathroom. Sir?

184
00:13:30,685 --> 00:13:31,727
I've gotta...

185
00:13:31,895 --> 00:13:33,687
- He broke the table.
- Son of a bitch.

186
00:13:34,439 --> 00:13:37,274
- I didn't do it.
- It's all right. It's all right.

187
00:13:37,442 --> 00:13:39,776
- I swear there was...
- The bathroom is that way.

188
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:40,986
...A baseball.

189
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:44,865
Maybe I'll open up a can of whup-ass
on him.

190
00:13:45,033 --> 00:13:47,910
Trying to do the kid a favor.

191
00:14:21,069 --> 00:14:22,694
Is he looking at you? What is he...?

192
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:25,030
- What is he doing down there?
- Oh. No. I...

193
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:27,199
- No, no, I wasn't... I wasn't...
- Mom, wait.

194
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:29,660
- Cover yourself. Cover yourself.
- Shit!

195
00:14:42,465 --> 00:14:47,427
- Ted, are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine. Everything's okay.

196
00:14:47,595 --> 00:14:50,347
Okay. Okay. Just take your time.
It's all right.

197
00:14:50,515 --> 00:14:53,016
You know, he's been in there
over a half an hour.

198
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:56,019
Charlie, I think he's masturbating.

199
00:14:56,187 --> 00:14:57,980
- Oh. Come on.
- Mom.

200
00:14:58,147 --> 00:14:59,773
He's not masturbating.

201
00:14:59,941 --> 00:15:02,651
He was watching you undress
with a silly grin on his face.

202
00:15:02,819 --> 00:15:05,320
No, I was watching the birds.

203
00:15:05,488 --> 00:15:07,406
- Do something.
- What do you want me to do?

204
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:10,909
I think he needs some male help.

205
00:15:11,077 --> 00:15:15,122
- Oh. For crying out...
- No, Dad. Just give him a minute.

206
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:19,751
- Okay, kid. Listen, I'm coming in. Okay?
- No, no. Don't.

207
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:23,297
Now. Exactly what the hell is the situation?
What. Did you shit yourself?

208
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:25,257
Oh, I wish.

209
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:27,384
I got it stuck.

210
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:29,845
You got what stuck?

211
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:34,558
It.

212
00:15:34,976 --> 00:15:40,647
Well, listen, it's not the end of the world.
These kind of things happen.

213
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:43,317
Let's have a look at it.

214
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:47,571
Oh, for God and heaven's sake!

215
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:51,908
- Quiet.
- Sheila.

216
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:54,411
- No.
- Sheila, honey?

217
00:15:54,579 --> 00:15:55,954
Don't...

218
00:15:56,122 --> 00:15:59,916
Sheila. Honey, you gotta come here.
You gotta see this.

219
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:01,918
- What is it?
- What? No.

220
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:04,546
- Come in here. Honey.
- No. No, don't.

221
00:16:04,714 --> 00:16:07,924
Don't worry. She's a dental hygienist.
She'll know what to do.

222
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:10,677
- Hi, Ted.
- Hi, Mrs. Jensen. How are you?

223
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:13,347
- You okay?
- Yeah.

224
00:16:13,556 --> 00:16:15,098
Holy shit.

225
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,934
- Charlie. You could have warned me.
- Keep it down.

226
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:19,770
- Okay, I...
- I'm sorry, Mrs. Jensen.

227
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:22,147
I don't want Mary to...
I don't want her to hear.

228
00:16:22,315 --> 00:16:24,191
Yeah. Let's just relax here. Okay?

229
00:16:24,359 --> 00:16:30,364
Now. What exactly
are we looking at here?

230
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:35,035
- What do you mean? What...?
- Well. I mean, is it the...?

231
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:37,579
Or the...?

232
00:16:38,373 --> 00:16:40,290
- Is it the frank or the beans?
- Right.

233
00:16:42,168 --> 00:16:45,087
I don't know. It looks like...
I think it's a little bit of both.

234
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:49,049
- Franks and beans. Franks and beans.
- Warren, quiet.

235
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:52,928
- What's that bubble there?
- What do you think? It's a...

236
00:16:53,096 --> 00:16:56,598
Well, how the hell did you get the beans
above the frank? I mean...

237
00:16:56,766 --> 00:16:59,726
I don't know. It wasn't like
it was a well-thought-out plan.

238
00:16:59,894 --> 00:17:03,397
You know, there really does seem to be
a lot of skin coming through there...

239
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:06,233
...so I'm gonna find some Bactine. Honey.

240
00:17:06,401 --> 00:17:08,735
No. You know what?
I don't need any. Really.

241
00:17:08,903 --> 00:17:11,446
- Hello there.
- Oh. Christ.

242
00:17:11,614 --> 00:17:13,407
What the hell's going on here?

243
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:18,453
- Neighbors said they heard a lady scream.
- Well. You're looking at him.

244
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:21,540
You gotta take a look at this thing.

245
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:25,293
- Oh. Jesus.
- Ain't it a beaut?

246
00:17:25,837 --> 00:17:29,965
What the hell were you thinking?

247
00:17:30,425 --> 00:17:33,427
How the hell did you get the zipper
all the way to the top?

248
00:17:33,761 --> 00:17:36,430
Well, let's just say the kid's limber.

249
00:17:38,433 --> 00:17:41,852
- Christ. What the...? God.
- You okay?

250
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:45,021
Somebody's gonna have to move
that station wagon so I can get in.

251
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:46,940
- Lenny. Come here.
- Who...?

252
00:17:47,233 --> 00:17:51,236
Take a look at what this numbnuts did.

253
00:17:51,404 --> 00:17:53,613
Holy shit.

254
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:00,787
Mike, Eddie. Get down here quick.
Bring everybody. Bring a camera.

255
00:18:00,955 --> 00:18:03,457
You're not gonna believe this.
We got a kid down here...

256
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:05,917
- What's your name?
- No, I...

257
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:08,753
No, there's only one thing to do here.

258
00:18:09,297 --> 00:18:12,466
What? No. You know what? I got an idea.
Look. Look. I can just...

259
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:16,386
We don't have to do anything. Because.
look. I can just wear this over the front.

260
00:18:16,554 --> 00:18:19,764
- I can go to the prom, deal with it later.
- Son. Relax.

261
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:22,184
You already laid the tracks.
That's the hard part.

262
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:23,935
Now we're just gonna back it up.

263
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:26,313
Teddy. Be brave.

264
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:29,483
It's just like pulling off a Band-Aid.

265
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:34,196
A one and a two...

266
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:35,947
...and a...

267
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:39,034
- We got a bleeder.
- Keep the pressure on it. Keep it on.

268
00:18:39,202 --> 00:18:41,369
Everybody get out of the way.

269
00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:47,959
- He was masturbating.
- People, please move out of the way.

270
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:51,796
- Please. Move. This is serious. People.
- He was masturbating.

271
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:54,716
- Move out of the way.
- None of this ever happened to Woogie.

272
00:18:54,884 --> 00:18:57,135
Are you okay. Ted?

273
00:18:58,429 --> 00:19:01,515
- Ted.
- He was masturbating.

274
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:06,269
- My God. Are you all right?
- Killer.

275
00:19:11,025 --> 00:19:13,276
Okay. Okay. Ted.

276
00:19:13,444 --> 00:19:16,071
- Okay, let's roll.
- All right, folks, it's over. Go home.

277
00:19:16,239 --> 00:19:17,822
Let's go. It's over.

278
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:31,086
So anyway,
school ended a couple of days later...

279
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:36,174
...and her father
got transferred to Florida in July.

280
00:19:36,342 --> 00:19:40,762
So I worked all summer
to pay off those debts and...

281
00:19:41,764 --> 00:19:44,474
...well. I never saw Mary again.

282
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:47,519
That was, what?

283
00:19:48,396 --> 00:19:52,857
- Thirteen years ago.
- Well. That's very interesting.

284
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:57,195
Anyway, I know it's not the type of thing
you'd forget, but I guess I just...

285
00:19:57,363 --> 00:19:58,655
I kind of, you know...

286
00:19:58,823 --> 00:20:01,783
I must have blocked it out of my head
or something...

287
00:20:01,951 --> 00:20:04,411
...because I was driving down the highway
last week...

288
00:20:04,579 --> 00:20:08,915
...and I started thinking about Mary.
and all of a sudden...

289
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:12,752
...it was like I couldn't breathe.
I mean. I was... I was...

290
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:15,255
I felt like I was gonna die.

291
00:20:15,798 --> 00:20:19,426
So I pulled off the road
and I just sort of stopped in this...

292
00:20:19,594 --> 00:20:24,681
I guess it was a rest area.
I was just kind of shaking. And...

293
00:20:25,433 --> 00:20:29,227
You know,
rest areas are homosexual hangouts.

294
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:33,440
Highway rest areas.

295
00:20:34,275 --> 00:20:39,446
They're the bathhouses of the '90s
for many, many. Many gay men.

296
00:20:43,618 --> 00:20:45,952
So. What are you...?

297
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:49,164
What are you saying?

298
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:54,336
Time, she's up.

299
00:20:55,004 --> 00:20:58,214
We'll delve into that next week.

300
00:21:01,802 --> 00:21:02,969
He called you gay?

301
00:21:04,847 --> 00:21:07,223
Well, he implied it.

302
00:21:08,601 --> 00:21:11,519
Well, you know, you are a writer,
and writers are artists.

303
00:21:11,687 --> 00:21:13,897
And, you know, most artists are...

304
00:21:14,065 --> 00:21:17,817
...a little kind of... A little foofy.
A little. You know...

305
00:21:18,653 --> 00:21:20,695
Foofy and woofy?

306
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:25,367
Let me ask you a question.
When you smoke a cigar...

307
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:29,120
...do you ever pretend it has balls?
You know, like go:

308
00:21:29,789 --> 00:21:33,625
Well, I mean. I have.

309
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:35,669
Haven't you?

310
00:21:39,173 --> 00:21:42,676
I'll tell you what. I'm gonna set you up
with my new assistant at work.

311
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:44,386
You're gonna love her.

312
00:21:47,014 --> 00:21:49,641
I don't know.
Let's face it, Dom. I'm in a slump.

313
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:52,560
I mean. Lately I've been feeling like...

314
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:54,229
Like...

315
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:57,190
Like a loser.

316
00:22:00,361 --> 00:22:03,655
A loser?
What the hell are you talking about?

317
00:22:03,823 --> 00:22:08,076
Jesus. Do you remember five years ago
when your kidneys failed?

318
00:22:08,244 --> 00:22:09,703
Now. If you were a loser...

319
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:12,789
...would they have found a donor
with a tissue match so quickly?

320
00:22:12,957 --> 00:22:16,376
I don't think so. What are the odds
of that, one in a million? Jesus.

321
00:22:16,544 --> 00:22:19,421
Great. So I'm lucky because
my brother died in an explosion?

322
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:23,883
I didn't say that. I said you're lucky
those kids found his kidneys.

323
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:27,345
Look. Your brother Jimmy
never gave a shit about you anyway.

324
00:22:30,391 --> 00:22:33,893
Look. Come on, man. You're a real
glass-is-half-empty kind of guy.

325
00:22:34,061 --> 00:22:37,981
You, sir, have got a fucking guardian angel.
You come here.

326
00:22:38,315 --> 00:22:42,944
So I chili-dipped, three putt at the 18th.
I lost it six ways.

327
00:22:43,112 --> 00:22:44,904
- He's a lucky bastard.
- Yeah, well.

328
00:22:45,072 --> 00:22:48,742
Hey, guys. I thought you might like
some of these with your beers.

329
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:52,078
- Yes, indeed. Ted, help yourself.
- I don't think I'm gonna have one.

330
00:22:52,246 --> 00:22:53,913
- Thanks, though.
- You don't want one?

331
00:22:54,081 --> 00:22:55,957
What do you want?
You want something else?

332
00:22:56,125 --> 00:22:58,418
- Come on. You want something to eat?
- Not hungry.

333
00:22:58,586 --> 00:23:02,547
You sure? You want a cookie? Something
like that? Honey. We got cookies?

334
00:23:02,715 --> 00:23:04,924
No, we don't, but, you know,
I could bake some.

335
00:23:05,092 --> 00:23:07,552
- No, no, no. Don't bake any.
- No, that's a good idea.

336
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:11,181
- Bake some. Bake some Toll Houses.
- Oh. Great. Yeah, yeah.

337
00:23:11,348 --> 00:23:14,809
- Chocolate chip or butterscotch?
- Let's go with the chocolate chip.

338
00:23:14,977 --> 00:23:17,979
- Really, you don't... It's...
- No, it's fine. Don't worry about it.

339
00:23:18,147 --> 00:23:20,523
- Really. She loves this kind of thing.
- Really?

340
00:23:20,691 --> 00:23:22,066
- Yeah.
- See. That's great.

341
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:25,278
That's what I want.

342
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:29,866
A family and somebody to. You know...

343
00:23:32,495 --> 00:23:35,330
It must be wonderful having all this.

344
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:38,708
Each day is better than the next.

345
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:43,254
How about you? The big L?

346
00:23:44,298 --> 00:23:45,965
- Ever been?
- What?

347
00:23:46,133 --> 00:23:47,634
In love.

348
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:50,803
Well, once.

349
00:23:51,889 --> 00:23:52,931
Mary.

350
00:23:53,474 --> 00:23:55,892
Oh, God. Not Mary again.

351
00:23:56,060 --> 00:24:01,814
Look. I know it was brief.
but it was definitely love, Dom.

352
00:24:01,982 --> 00:24:04,817
I mean.
crushes don't last for 13 years, right?

353
00:24:05,528 --> 00:24:06,945
Whatever happened to Mary?

354
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:09,531
Told you. She moved with her family
to Miami.

355
00:24:09,698 --> 00:24:11,032
So why don't you look her up?

356
00:24:11,575 --> 00:24:15,119
I did once. I called. She wasn't listed.

357
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:18,081
So that's it? You get one bump in the road
and give up?

358
00:24:18,249 --> 00:24:20,750
Well, it's probably for the best.
After 13 years...

359
00:24:20,918 --> 00:24:22,919
...she's probably gonna think
I'm a stalker.

360
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:26,089
You know what you should do?
Hire a private investigator.

361
00:24:26,257 --> 00:24:28,925
To find her, follow her around.
She won't know anything.

362
00:24:29,093 --> 00:24:31,719
No way. That's way too creepy.

363
00:24:31,887 --> 00:24:36,307
Besides. She's probably married with
a couple of kids by now. Girls like Mary...

364
00:24:36,976 --> 00:24:38,768
...they don't stay single.

365
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:44,732
Hey, I've got an idea. There's this guy
down in my office. His name's Healy.

366
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:47,485
He's a claims investigator.
He's a hell of a bloodhound.

367
00:24:47,653 --> 00:24:50,822
He shoots down to Miami
every couple of weeks. He can help you out.

368
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:53,825
This guy runs a little hot,
but he gets the job done.

369
00:24:57,454 --> 00:24:58,997
So...

370
00:24:59,665 --> 00:25:03,835
...Dom tells me you're looking for
some lady friend you knew back at school.

371
00:25:04,003 --> 00:25:05,920
Yeah. Yeah.

372
00:25:06,088 --> 00:25:09,591
That's cute. I don't buy it. But it's cute.

373
00:25:10,676 --> 00:25:11,884
You're not buying what?

374
00:25:12,052 --> 00:25:16,639
Ted, I'm the kind of guy
who likes to shoot from the hip.

375
00:25:19,059 --> 00:25:21,269
I want you to level with me.

376
00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:29,777
Come on. Let's talk.
Did you knock this skirt up?

377
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:31,237
No.

378
00:25:31,697 --> 00:25:36,242
- She's blackmailing you, right?
- Blackmailing me? No.

379
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:40,246
- You want her dead. Don't you?
- Dead?

380
00:25:40,414 --> 00:25:42,957
Are you...? You're not serious. Are you?

381
00:25:43,125 --> 00:25:46,502
You expect me to believe
this is a straight stalker case? Come on.

382
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:49,589
Hey, hey, hey. I'm not a stalker.
I'm not a stalker, all right?

383
00:25:49,757 --> 00:25:52,008
- She's a friend of mine.
- Oh. Sure she is.

384
00:25:52,176 --> 00:25:54,594
That explains why
she's got an unlisted number...

385
00:25:54,762 --> 00:25:57,138
...and you haven't heard squat from her
in 13 years.

386
00:25:57,306 --> 00:25:58,890
Yeah. Real chum.

387
00:25:59,058 --> 00:26:02,101
- What...?
- You're good, Ted. Real piece of work.

388
00:26:02,269 --> 00:26:05,605
What are you...? You know what?
Forget it. Just forget the whole thing.

389
00:26:06,607 --> 00:26:07,899
Okay. I'll do it.

390
00:26:08,609 --> 00:26:12,612
But if this chick turns up with a toe tag,
I'm rolling over on you, big guy.

391
00:26:14,156 --> 00:26:15,698
All right.

392
00:26:33,217 --> 00:26:36,010
Healy, you dog.

393
00:26:36,637 --> 00:26:38,513
Sully. Look at you.

394
00:26:38,681 --> 00:26:41,641
You hot shit. You look fucking pisser.

395
00:26:41,809 --> 00:26:44,811
Hey. Hey, good fella.

396
00:26:44,978 --> 00:26:46,979
- Does he bite?
- A little bit.

397
00:26:47,147 --> 00:26:48,523
Get in.

398
00:26:51,652 --> 00:26:55,029
- Here's the info you asked for.
- Thanks.

399
00:26:55,197 --> 00:26:58,533
You know, you should thank me.
That girl was not easy to find.

400
00:26:58,701 --> 00:27:01,744
What. Did she scam you
out of some insurance dough?

401
00:27:01,912 --> 00:27:06,499
No. Some guy gave me a couple bucks
to track down his high school girlfriend.

402
00:27:06,667 --> 00:27:08,459
Stalker, huh?

403
00:27:08,794 --> 00:27:11,254
Yep. Big-time.

404
00:27:13,966 --> 00:27:16,926
You would not believe
all the pussy down here.

405
00:27:17,094 --> 00:27:19,679
It's like shooting fish in a barrel.

406
00:27:19,847 --> 00:27:22,014
- Yeah? You getting any?
- Nothing.

407
00:27:24,518 --> 00:27:26,477
There you go.

408
00:27:28,188 --> 00:27:30,815
- Hey, shoes off.
- What the...?

409
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:34,026
Are you kidding me?

410
00:27:35,195 --> 00:27:38,197
You... You are so full of...
Look at this place.

411
00:27:38,365 --> 00:27:40,366
- Yeah, I'm doing okay.
- Doing okay?

412
00:27:40,534 --> 00:27:42,869
I gotta get ready for work.

413
00:27:43,704 --> 00:27:46,414
This pad. Those killer wheels.

414
00:27:46,582 --> 00:27:49,083
Man, it looks like
you really cleaned up your act.

415
00:27:49,251 --> 00:27:52,670
Yeah. What can I tell you?
It's a healthier lifestyle down here.

416
00:27:52,838 --> 00:27:56,424
It's easier to succeed. You know.
when your head is clear.

417
00:27:56,592 --> 00:28:00,261
- Yeah.
- Those guys back in Boston?

418
00:28:00,888 --> 00:28:03,473
Oh, fucking animals.

419
00:28:05,392 --> 00:28:09,937
Hey, what do you say we go out and grab
a couple of pops before you go to work?

420
00:28:10,773 --> 00:28:14,150
None for me. Buddy.
I don't drink any more.

421
00:28:14,318 --> 00:28:17,528
Yeah. You don't drink any less, right?

422
00:28:20,115 --> 00:28:21,741
What the...?

423
00:28:24,244 --> 00:28:26,996
That's Bill.
Don't worry. I fed him last week.

424
00:28:28,373 --> 00:28:30,958
- Does he bite?
- Nips.

425
00:28:38,509 --> 00:28:41,427
Nineteen months I've been straight.

426
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:45,056
Is that right? Good for you. Sully.

427
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:49,769
Yeah. It was hard at first,
but I'm there. I'm there.

428
00:28:50,103 --> 00:28:52,647
Hey, I'm proud of you.
How about a frosty to celebrate?

429
00:28:53,607 --> 00:28:55,608
Didn't you hear what I just said?

430
00:28:57,027 --> 00:29:00,029
Sully. You were never an alky.
You were a cokehead.

431
00:29:00,197 --> 00:29:04,116
Yeah. But when you quit the nose candy.
you gotta quit the booze too.

432
00:29:04,284 --> 00:29:08,704
Who told you that? Sully, it's one...
It's a lite beer.

433
00:29:09,665 --> 00:29:12,166
Oh, the big. Bad beer's gonna get you.

434
00:29:14,628 --> 00:29:17,129
- It's you I'm worried about.
- You're worried about me?

435
00:29:17,297 --> 00:29:20,591
Yeah. You gotta bend a little bit,
or believe me. You're gonna break.

436
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:23,135
- You think?
- Oh. Yeah.

437
00:29:23,971 --> 00:29:27,890
You gotta learn to have a pop once in
a while or you're gonna fall off the wagon.

438
00:29:28,058 --> 00:29:30,226
You're being a fanatic.

439
00:29:31,728 --> 00:29:34,146
Well, jeez...

440
00:29:34,314 --> 00:29:37,817
...I don't wanna fall off the wagon.
- No.

441
00:29:39,069 --> 00:29:42,780
- I mean. Not after 19 months.
- Exactly.

442
00:29:56,670 --> 00:30:00,756
Jesus. You know what? This shit
doesn't even taste good to me anymore.

443
00:30:00,924 --> 00:30:03,593
Fuck you then. You big pussy.
I'll drink it.

444
00:30:30,412 --> 00:30:32,955
Looks like we found your Mary. Ted.

445
00:30:33,206 --> 00:30:35,791
Husband: negative.

446
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:39,921
Children and a Labrador: negative.

447
00:30:40,088 --> 00:30:44,300
Tight little package: affirmative.

448
00:30:52,059 --> 00:30:53,309
Good morning. Magda.

449
00:30:54,061 --> 00:30:56,145
- Hi, doll. You're in my light.
- Sorry.

450
00:30:58,357 --> 00:31:02,068
- So you've been out here all night again?
- Bet your ass I have.

451
00:31:02,235 --> 00:31:04,779
This is an important job,
neighborhood watch is.

452
00:31:05,405 --> 00:31:07,698
Neighborhood watch.
Is that what we're calling it?

453
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:11,410
Listening to perfect strangers'
telephone conversations.

454
00:31:12,746 --> 00:31:15,748
This only picks up cellular phones
in a half-a-mile radius.

455
00:31:16,792 --> 00:31:17,833
Meaning?

456
00:31:18,001 --> 00:31:21,754
These are the people you live amongst.
You got a right to know if they're creeps.

457
00:31:21,922 --> 00:31:25,091
For instance. Do you know the guy
in the green house down the street?

458
00:31:25,258 --> 00:31:26,300
Yeah.

459
00:31:26,468 --> 00:31:28,094
Cheating on his wife.

460
00:31:28,762 --> 00:31:32,682
And I am not surprised.
I am not surprised at all...

461
00:31:32,849 --> 00:31:35,893
...because Puffy used to bark his balls off
whenever he saw him.

462
00:31:36,061 --> 00:31:39,271
And you know that Puffy,
he only barks at the bad people.

463
00:31:40,148 --> 00:31:41,732
Okay.

464
00:31:42,234 --> 00:31:45,903
Well, I'm gonna go hit some golf balls
and hook up with Warren...

465
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:47,571
...so try to get some sleep.

466
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:51,117
- Okay. Bye. Doll.
- May I make a suggestion?

467
00:31:51,284 --> 00:31:54,787
Try not drinking so early in the morning
because you smell like a gin mill.

468
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:58,958
I smell like a gin mill?

469
00:32:00,961 --> 00:32:04,797
Does Mommy?
Does Mommy smell like a gin mill?

470
00:32:10,721 --> 00:32:12,555
Hello.

471
00:32:19,896 --> 00:32:22,648
Hey, Herb. How's it going?
Apple for you today.

472
00:32:22,816 --> 00:32:24,150
Thanks, Mary.

473
00:32:24,317 --> 00:32:27,528
- Have a good day. See you later.
- Looking good, honey.

474
00:32:58,268 --> 00:33:00,728
- Hi, Mary.
- Hey, Mrs. Bailey. How you doing?

475
00:33:01,396 --> 00:33:03,230
Looks like we got a jock on our hands.

476
00:33:10,405 --> 00:33:13,157
- Here, you want the sports page?
- Thank you.

477
00:33:14,034 --> 00:33:16,744
- Take care now.
- Bye, guys. See you.

478
00:33:39,392 --> 00:33:41,435
Yeah. Remember, I have two. Mary.

479
00:33:41,603 --> 00:33:45,022
Yeah. You can have two halves.
just like everybody else.

480
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:47,066
Yeah. That's good.

481
00:33:48,610 --> 00:33:50,903
- Will you marry me. Mary?
- I would love to. Jimmy.

482
00:33:51,071 --> 00:33:54,907
But I'm already engaged to Freddie.

483
00:33:55,742 --> 00:33:58,744
- Who's Freddie? Me?
- Yes, you.

484
00:33:59,246 --> 00:34:01,038
Will you marry me?

485
00:34:02,207 --> 00:34:05,376
What about Dolores?
You gonna marry us both?

486
00:34:05,544 --> 00:34:07,169
I'm gonna kiss you.

487
00:34:07,462 --> 00:34:10,464
I think you're making out
pretty well there. Okay.

488
00:34:11,633 --> 00:34:14,593
- Thanks, Mary.
- You're welcome, Zack.

489
00:34:15,137 --> 00:34:17,179
- No onions.
- No onions.

490
00:34:17,347 --> 00:34:19,390
No onions. How are you doing?

491
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:23,227
Listen to this one.

492
00:34:23,395 --> 00:34:27,439
"Seeking sensitive Wasp doctor
to share candlelit dinners...

493
00:34:27,607 --> 00:34:30,276
...long walks in Coconut Grove,
marriage."

494
00:34:30,443 --> 00:34:33,779
Is she looking for a corpse?
You have to be specific when you write.

495
00:34:33,947 --> 00:34:38,200
You have to say
"Seeking deaf-mute with, you know...

496
00:34:38,368 --> 00:34:40,286
...3-pound cock and trust fund."

497
00:34:43,373 --> 00:34:46,542
I want a guy who can play 36 holes
and still have enough energy...

498
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:49,336
...to take me and Warren to a ball game
and eat hot dogs.

499
00:34:49,504 --> 00:34:53,299
I'm talking sausage hot dogs. Beer.
Not lite beer, but beer.

500
00:34:53,466 --> 00:34:54,758
That's my ad. Print it up.

501
00:34:56,553 --> 00:34:59,722
A fatty who likes beer and golf.

502
00:34:59,890 --> 00:35:02,808
Jeez. Mary.
where are you gonna find a gem like that?

503
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:07,062
Okay. Well. Here's the catch.

504
00:35:07,314 --> 00:35:09,273
He has to be self-employed.

505
00:35:09,649 --> 00:35:10,691
Like a drug dealer?

506
00:35:12,068 --> 00:35:17,364
No, I was thinking along the lines, maybe,
of somebody like an architect or something.

507
00:35:17,532 --> 00:35:20,826
But I want somebody
with freedom in their job, you know?

508
00:35:20,994 --> 00:35:25,206
Somebody who can do it anywhere
and just leave at a drop of a hat.

509
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:29,376
And where would you
and your beer-bellied architect be going to?

510
00:35:30,045 --> 00:35:31,503
- The Super Bowl?
- Yeah.

511
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:32,922
That's good.

512
00:35:33,089 --> 00:35:35,257
I don't know.
Maybe a few months in Nepal.

513
00:35:35,425 --> 00:35:36,675
Nepal.

514
00:35:36,843 --> 00:35:39,929
And you'd probably dump the poor guy
halfway to Katmandu.

515
00:35:40,597 --> 00:35:41,931
What's that supposed to mean?

516
00:35:42,098 --> 00:35:45,017
- It means you change your mind too much.
- No, I don't.

517
00:35:45,185 --> 00:35:46,352
Come off it, Mary.

518
00:35:46,519 --> 00:35:49,063
Remember that gorgeous,
corn-fed white boy, honey...

519
00:35:49,231 --> 00:35:51,774
...that you just dumped
like yesterday's garbage?

520
00:35:51,942 --> 00:35:53,442
What was his name? Pack man.

521
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:58,030
Okay. We had fun for a while.

522
00:35:58,198 --> 00:36:01,492
Mary, cut the crap.
What really happened with Brett?

523
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:03,869
Yeah. Brett seemed so sweet.

524
00:36:05,372 --> 00:36:08,540
You know what Tucker said
Brett told him?

525
00:36:09,042 --> 00:36:11,210
He said that if Warren wasn't in my life...

526
00:36:11,378 --> 00:36:14,046
...that he would have popped the question
a long time ago.

527
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:17,049
- Oh. Man.
- What a shock.

528
00:36:17,592 --> 00:36:20,511
To hell with Brett. You know?

529
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:23,931
I've got a vibrator.

530
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:34,108
- Hello?
- Hello?

531
00:36:34,275 --> 00:36:37,277
- Sully?
- Hello?

532
00:36:38,071 --> 00:36:41,573
- Sully, is that you?
- May I ask who's calling. Please?

533
00:36:41,741 --> 00:36:45,369
Sully. It's me. Healy.
What's going on over there?

534
00:36:45,537 --> 00:36:49,623
Fucking Patrick Healy.
You think your shit don't stink.

535
00:36:49,791 --> 00:36:51,458
Well, I got news for you.

536
00:36:51,626 --> 00:36:54,753
You're goddamn right it don't.

537
00:36:55,296 --> 00:36:58,090
Hey, I wanna thank you for the other day.

538
00:36:58,258 --> 00:37:01,635
You really helped me. You were right.

539
00:37:01,803 --> 00:37:03,721
Hold, please.

540
00:37:06,725 --> 00:37:08,434
I haven't even wanted a beer.

541
00:37:09,269 --> 00:37:11,145
- How are you, buddy?
- I'm fine.

542
00:37:11,312 --> 00:37:15,941
I just wanted to let you know I'll have
your car back to you in a couple hours.

543
00:37:16,109 --> 00:37:19,278
- I'm still staking out this bread's apartment.
- Hey.

544
00:37:19,446 --> 00:37:24,283
Well, you were right.
I was uptight. I was...

545
00:37:24,826 --> 00:37:26,577
...tight.

546
00:37:27,203 --> 00:37:31,123
You know who I miss?
Those guys in Boston.

547
00:37:35,128 --> 00:37:37,004
Hold on a sec.

548
00:37:52,312 --> 00:37:55,189
Those are the plays of the month.
Thank you for joining us.

549
00:37:55,356 --> 00:38:00,319
Look forward to seeing you next Sunday
on The Sports Machine. Have a good week.

550
00:38:10,997 --> 00:38:13,332
Oh, yeah.

551
00:38:14,918 --> 00:38:16,710
Here comes the money shot.

552
00:38:26,346 --> 00:38:28,680
First chink in the armor, Ted.

553
00:38:33,812 --> 00:38:35,354
Shit.

554
00:38:37,816 --> 00:38:40,150
Oh, yeah.

555
00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:50,536
Pop, you wanna get me a whiskey sour
when you get a sec?

556
00:38:50,703 --> 00:38:51,745
Whiskey sour
coming up.

557
00:38:51,913 --> 00:38:55,499
- I got some excellent news for you.
- Oh. Yeah? Excellent?

558
00:38:55,667 --> 00:38:59,753
- I think your life's about to change.
- Really? So you found her?

559
00:38:59,921 --> 00:39:06,385
Oh, yeah. And you were right, man.
She really is something else. My God.

560
00:39:06,553 --> 00:39:11,056
Really? So she hasn't changed at all. Huh?

561
00:39:11,808 --> 00:39:16,019
Well, that I couldn't say.
Let me ask you something.

562
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:19,940
Was Mary a little big-boned
back in high school?

563
00:39:20,108 --> 00:39:23,694
Big-boned? No, no, not at all. No.

564
00:39:24,028 --> 00:39:26,655
I guess she packed on a few pounds
over the years.

565
00:39:27,073 --> 00:39:29,491
Oh, yeah? So she's a little...?
She's a little chubby?

566
00:39:29,659 --> 00:39:32,411
I'd say about a deuce, deuce and a half.
Not bad.

567
00:39:33,997 --> 00:39:35,914
My. A deuce and a half. Huh?

568
00:39:36,082 --> 00:39:38,500
Well, you know,
you shit out a bunch of kids...

569
00:39:38,668 --> 00:39:41,128
...and you're bound to put on
a few pounds.

570
00:39:41,462 --> 00:39:43,964
So she's...? She's married?

571
00:39:44,132 --> 00:39:46,717
No, no, she's never been.
That's the good news.

572
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:48,844
Yeah.

573
00:39:49,012 --> 00:39:52,347
Four kids. Three different guys.
but no rock.

574
00:39:52,515 --> 00:39:54,266
Hyperactive little fuckers too.

575
00:39:54,434 --> 00:39:57,436
Tough to keep up with in a wheelchair,
I bet.

576
00:39:57,937 --> 00:40:00,981
She's in a wheelchair?
Mary's in a wheelchair?

577
00:40:01,608 --> 00:40:03,525
I thought that was part of your kick.

578
00:40:03,693 --> 00:40:06,278
- Excuse me. I ordered a whiskey sour.
- Yeah, whatever.

579
00:40:06,446 --> 00:40:09,281
Are you sure it's the same Mary?
You got the right person?

580
00:40:09,449 --> 00:40:12,451
Oh, yeah. It's Mary. All right.
The brother. Warren?

581
00:40:13,453 --> 00:40:15,120
Hey, don't look so shocked. Ted.

582
00:40:15,288 --> 00:40:20,334
It's been a long time. I bet you've changed
a lot over the last 13 years. Haven't you?

583
00:40:20,501 --> 00:40:24,963
- What, do you think your shit don't stink?
- No, I don't think... I mean, yes. It doe...

584
00:40:25,131 --> 00:40:27,633
- I don't...
- Okay, I got all the information you need.

585
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:30,135
I got it off her bookie. Nice guy.

586
00:40:30,637 --> 00:40:34,473
You really should look her up, Ted.
I mean. She's a real spark plug, this one.

587
00:40:34,641 --> 00:40:38,268
Well, thank you.
Thanks, Healy. Good work.

588
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:42,856
Ted, don't you want the name
of the housing project?

589
00:40:44,901 --> 00:40:46,401
What?

590
00:40:46,569 --> 00:40:47,611
...For 1995.

591
00:40:47,779 --> 00:40:50,239
See the Sarene boys
on Route 1 in South Brattleboro...

592
00:40:50,406 --> 00:40:54,034
...and right here on Jefferson Boulevard
in Warwick. You'll be...

593
00:41:07,924 --> 00:41:11,093
Well. It hurts from the bottom

594
00:41:11,261 --> 00:41:14,638
And it hurts down to your soul

595
00:41:14,806 --> 00:41:18,767
That's because true love is not nice

596
00:41:21,396 --> 00:41:23,939
And it brings up hurt

597
00:41:24,107 --> 00:41:27,609
From when you were 5 years old

598
00:41:27,777 --> 00:41:31,697
That's because true love is not nice

599
00:41:31,864 --> 00:41:33,490
No

600
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:38,328
Oh, pain. Pain. Pain

601
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:41,540
Ain't that just love's name?

602
00:41:41,708 --> 00:41:47,087
Love can bring up hurt
From way down low

603
00:41:48,006 --> 00:41:51,216
It now be emphasized

604
00:41:51,384 --> 00:41:55,262
True love is just not civilized

605
00:41:55,430 --> 00:41:57,806
True love is not nice

606
00:41:57,974 --> 00:41:59,933
No, no

607
00:42:06,899 --> 00:42:08,400
Where are you going?

608
00:42:09,777 --> 00:42:13,905
- Oh. I resigned.
- Good luck in Miami, Pat.

609
00:42:14,073 --> 00:42:17,951
Miami? What are you doing in Miami?

610
00:42:18,745 --> 00:42:21,204
I took a job offer.

611
00:42:21,372 --> 00:42:22,914
With who?

612
00:42:23,333 --> 00:42:26,752
With Rice-a-Roni.

613
00:42:27,045 --> 00:42:30,088
Isn't that the San Francisco treat?

614
00:42:30,256 --> 00:42:32,007
It was.

615
00:42:32,717 --> 00:42:35,177
- They're changing their image.
- Yeah, well, listen.

616
00:42:35,345 --> 00:42:37,763
- I've been thinking about what you said.
- Good. Good.

617
00:42:37,930 --> 00:42:41,266
And I still wanna look her up.

618
00:42:41,434 --> 00:42:45,145
Who? Roller pig? Are you nuts?

619
00:42:45,313 --> 00:42:48,774
I thought you said
she was a real spark plug.

620
00:42:48,941 --> 00:42:52,736
No, no, I said butt plug. She's heinous.

621
00:42:55,782 --> 00:42:58,784
You know what?
All the same. I think I wanna call her.

622
00:42:58,951 --> 00:43:01,036
I mean. I know it sounds crazy...

623
00:43:01,204 --> 00:43:03,455
...but. I don't know.
maybe I can help her out.

624
00:43:03,623 --> 00:43:07,417
I feel bad, you know. The poor thing.
she's in a wheelchair for God's sakes.

625
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:12,255
- It's a bunion. It'll heal.
- Bunion? You... I thought...

626
00:43:12,423 --> 00:43:15,050
You know what? That's not even it.
The point is. I just...

627
00:43:15,218 --> 00:43:20,847
I know this doesn't make sense to you,
but I can't just turn it off that fast.

628
00:43:23,309 --> 00:43:26,520
I guess I still have feelings for her.

629
00:43:27,647 --> 00:43:30,482
This girl really means something
to you. Huh?

630
00:43:34,779 --> 00:43:36,154
All right.

631
00:43:36,781 --> 00:43:38,365
Tell you what.

632
00:43:39,659 --> 00:43:42,411
I'll get you her number
as soon as she gets back from Japan.

633
00:43:42,578 --> 00:43:44,746
Thank you, I appreciate...

634
00:43:44,914 --> 00:43:49,000
Japan? What's happening in Japan?
Why is she going to Japan?

635
00:43:50,044 --> 00:43:52,504
You've heard of mail-order brides,
haven't you?

636
00:43:52,672 --> 00:43:55,966
- Well. They go that way too.
- Mary's a...?

637
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:58,468
What are they, desperate? She's a whale.

638
00:43:58,636 --> 00:44:02,973
Don't forget. It's a sumo culture.
They pay by the pound there.

639
00:44:04,475 --> 00:44:06,184
Sort of like tuna.

640
00:44:07,687 --> 00:44:09,688
What happened to...?
You said she was single.

641
00:44:09,856 --> 00:44:13,900
- Remember. No rock?
- You had your window. Ted. You blew it.

642
00:44:16,779 --> 00:44:18,822
I had my window?

643
00:44:20,825 --> 00:44:24,870
I'm sorry, buddy. It's just, you know,
you're taking this all wrong.

644
00:44:25,037 --> 00:44:28,582
Okay? I mean, come on. You're liberated.
I feel liberated.

645
00:44:28,749 --> 00:44:32,335
I mean. You're in therapy thinking
you blew it with the greatest girl ever...

646
00:44:32,503 --> 00:44:35,547
...and it turns out that getting your dick
stuck in your zipper...

647
00:44:35,715 --> 00:44:37,924
...was the best thing
that ever happened to you.

648
00:44:38,092 --> 00:44:41,344
- Say it a little louder?
- I'm sorry, but it was.

649
00:44:42,805 --> 00:44:44,890
I never told you that.

650
00:44:45,933 --> 00:44:48,643
Christ. Ted. I was only four towns away.

651
00:44:48,895 --> 00:44:51,521
- Excuse me.
- Oh. Sure, sweetheart.

652
00:44:51,689 --> 00:44:52,814
Oh, man. I gotta go.

653
00:44:52,982 --> 00:44:56,735
I gotta get up at 6 a.m. and help
my boss's brother move into his apartment.

654
00:44:56,903 --> 00:45:00,989
- Your boss's brother? Who's that?
- I don't even know. I never met him.

655
00:45:01,157 --> 00:45:04,409
Ted, you gotta finish that novel
so you can quit that stupid magazine.

656
00:45:04,577 --> 00:45:05,744
Yeah.

657
00:45:11,918 --> 00:45:13,793
Nice swing.

658
00:45:21,344 --> 00:45:23,178
Christ. Hit a house.

659
00:45:24,222 --> 00:45:26,097
I haven't swung the wrenches in a while.

660
00:45:31,479 --> 00:45:33,980
Would you mind giving me
some pointers here?

661
00:45:35,233 --> 00:45:38,193
Yeah. Sure.
Don't talk in someone's backswing.

662
00:45:39,195 --> 00:45:40,904
Oh, thanks.

663
00:45:42,114 --> 00:45:45,283
- I'm gonna go get a soda. You want one?
- No, thanks.

664
00:45:49,121 --> 00:45:53,166
Look. I'm sorry to bother you again.
but you got change of a dollar?

665
00:45:54,168 --> 00:45:55,210
No.

666
00:45:56,087 --> 00:45:58,588
All I got are these damn Nepalese coins.

667
00:46:02,593 --> 00:46:04,302
You've been to Nepal?

668
00:46:07,473 --> 00:46:09,140
Not in months.

669
00:46:09,308 --> 00:46:11,893
I don't even know why
I bought the damn place.

670
00:46:18,276 --> 00:46:22,988
- Nice meeting you again.
- You too. Again.

671
00:46:25,491 --> 00:46:26,700
So. What's your name?

672
00:46:27,827 --> 00:46:29,661
Pat Healy.

673
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:33,957
Wanna know mine?

674
00:46:35,001 --> 00:46:37,002
I already know it, Mary.

675
00:46:38,588 --> 00:46:39,671
How'd you know that?

676
00:46:40,715 --> 00:46:43,341
Because it's right there on your golf bag.

677
00:46:50,433 --> 00:46:51,850
Damn.

678
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:55,228
Wow. Are those blueprints?

679
00:46:55,396 --> 00:47:00,358
Oh, these? They're just some projects
I'm working on.

680
00:47:00,526 --> 00:47:03,903
Museum, hospital for kids.

681
00:47:04,071 --> 00:47:05,739
Really? Are you an architect?

682
00:47:06,365 --> 00:47:09,618
Just till I get my PGA tour card.

683
00:47:10,494 --> 00:47:15,790
No, I mean. Are they putting up
some sort of a new museum in town. or...?

684
00:47:15,958 --> 00:47:19,461
Well, to tell you the truth,
I'm sort of burnt-out on talking about it.

685
00:47:19,629 --> 00:47:21,713
Oh, I'm sorry.

686
00:47:21,881 --> 00:47:24,299
It's just a job. Really.
Something to keep me moving.

687
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:28,637
- My real passion is my hobby.
- Really? What's that?

688
00:47:29,138 --> 00:47:30,889
I work with retards.

689
00:47:32,975 --> 00:47:35,977
Isn't that a little politically incorrect?

690
00:47:36,145 --> 00:47:38,313
Well, the hell with that.

691
00:47:38,481 --> 00:47:41,900
No one's gonna tell me
who I can and can't work with, right?

692
00:47:42,068 --> 00:47:45,695
- No, I mean...
- We got this one kid. Mongo.

693
00:47:45,863 --> 00:47:49,074
He's got a forehead like
a drive-in movie theater. He's a good shit...

694
00:47:49,241 --> 00:47:51,117
...so we don't bust his chops too much.

695
00:47:51,285 --> 00:47:55,080
- So one day. Mongo gets out of his cage...
- What, they keep him in a cage?

696
00:47:55,539 --> 00:47:58,583
- Well. It's just an enclosure.
- No, but they keep him confined?

697
00:47:58,751 --> 00:48:00,794
- Right, yeah.
- That's bullshit.

698
00:48:00,961 --> 00:48:02,253
Well, that's what I said.

699
00:48:02,421 --> 00:48:05,465
- So I went out and I got him a leash.
- A leash?

700
00:48:05,633 --> 00:48:09,928
Yeah. One you can hook on to the
clothesline and he can run back and forth...

701
00:48:10,096 --> 00:48:15,642
...and there's plenty of room
for him to dig and play.

702
00:48:15,810 --> 00:48:19,229
That kid has really...
He's really blossomed, you know?

703
00:48:19,397 --> 00:48:21,856
Now I can take him to movies...

704
00:48:23,317 --> 00:48:24,442
...baseball games.

705
00:48:24,610 --> 00:48:26,611
You know, fun stuff.

706
00:48:27,488 --> 00:48:30,031
- Yeah.
- Sounds cool.

707
00:48:30,199 --> 00:48:33,535
Oh, yeah, it's cool for them.
but for me, it's much more than that.

708
00:48:33,703 --> 00:48:36,830
For me, it's heaven. You know?

709
00:48:37,039 --> 00:48:41,501
Those goofy bastards are just about
the best thing I've got going in this...

710
00:48:42,503 --> 00:48:44,087
...crazy world.

711
00:48:47,550 --> 00:48:50,802
Hey, dipshit.
be careful with that thing, will you?

712
00:48:51,303 --> 00:48:53,722
- What?
- You heard me.

713
00:48:53,889 --> 00:48:56,891
You already put a fucking nick
in my piano.

714
00:48:57,059 --> 00:49:00,145
Well, I'll try to be a little more careful.

715
00:49:00,730 --> 00:49:03,356
What. Are you fading?
You wimping out on me?

716
00:49:03,524 --> 00:49:06,860
It's just that this is a little bit heavy.
that's all.

717
00:49:07,027 --> 00:49:10,280
Heavy? What I wouldn't give
to know what heavy feels like...

718
00:49:10,448 --> 00:49:12,031
...you insensitive prick.

719
00:49:12,658 --> 00:49:16,286
- No, I didn't mean that.
- Yeah, yeah. I'm going down the street...

720
00:49:16,454 --> 00:49:18,705
...to get coffee.
- Wait. I'll get you the coffee.

721
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:21,583
Could you just...? Hey, I'm sorry.

722
00:49:35,222 --> 00:49:37,015
Hey, you!

723
00:49:37,183 --> 00:49:40,059
You with the furniture. Hey.

724
00:49:40,728 --> 00:49:43,730
- I'm Steve Tyler with The Troubleshooters.
- Oh. Yeah. Hey.

725
00:49:43,898 --> 00:49:46,483
Do you know your truck
is parked in a handicapped zone?

726
00:49:46,650 --> 00:49:49,861
- Oh. It's okay. The guy who...
- You don't look very handicapped to me.

727
00:49:50,029 --> 00:49:53,865
- Why would you do something like that?
- I'm not handicapped. But the guy who has...

728
00:49:54,033 --> 00:49:57,368
Are you getting this?
Make sure you get a close-up on his face.

729
00:49:57,536 --> 00:50:00,371
There's a handicapped guy.
he's got an electric wheelchair.

730
00:50:00,539 --> 00:50:04,334
There's a disabled schmuck who's
in a wheelchair. He's coming back.

731
00:50:08,714 --> 00:50:12,383
Tender facial tissue left of L7.

732
00:50:14,220 --> 00:50:15,970
Hey, Bob?

733
00:50:16,514 --> 00:50:18,556
Remember Mary?

734
00:50:19,058 --> 00:50:21,059
Oh, yeah.

735
00:50:21,393 --> 00:50:23,561
I remember Mary.

736
00:50:24,355 --> 00:50:28,107
Hey, I saw her a couple months ago
at a convention in Las Vegas.

737
00:50:28,859 --> 00:50:30,610
How could you see her at a convention?

738
00:50:30,778 --> 00:50:33,530
Well, I'm a chiropractor.
she's an orthopedic surgeon.

739
00:50:33,697 --> 00:50:35,240
She's a what?

740
00:50:35,407 --> 00:50:40,787
She's an orthopedic surgeon.
and...she's still a fox.

741
00:50:42,665 --> 00:50:45,124
What if the families
don't want a class action?

742
00:50:45,793 --> 00:50:49,337
God, that's what I've been trying to explain
to you people for the last hour.

743
00:50:49,505 --> 00:50:51,965
Okay. Fine, we'll go over it again. I...

744
00:50:52,132 --> 00:50:53,132
Mary's a fox.

745
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:54,676
- What?
- What?

746
00:50:54,844 --> 00:50:56,928
Mary's a fox? What are you...?

747
00:50:57,096 --> 00:51:01,391
Folks, here, let's... We'll break up.
We'll spitball this tomorrow, okay?

748
00:51:02,810 --> 00:51:05,895
- What the hell are you talking about?
- Mary? My Mary?

749
00:51:06,063 --> 00:51:09,023
She's not in Japan.
She has no rug rats running around.

750
00:51:09,191 --> 00:51:12,777
My friend says she's a fox.
A surgeon fox.

751
00:51:12,945 --> 00:51:15,196
I don't get it. I don't know what you're...
Healy...

752
00:51:15,364 --> 00:51:17,991
Think about it.
He never even looked her up down there.

753
00:51:18,158 --> 00:51:22,245
He was there closing his deal
with the Rice-a-Roni people the whole time.

754
00:51:25,666 --> 00:51:27,208
What's up with your head?

755
00:51:27,376 --> 00:51:31,170
Oh, I get hives
tap-dancing for these idiots.

756
00:51:31,338 --> 00:51:33,381
I get a little stressed out.

757
00:51:33,549 --> 00:51:37,677
Jeez. You know. I feel like a royal shit
because I set you up with this guy.

758
00:51:40,014 --> 00:51:42,390
You know what you gotta do.
You gotta call her.

759
00:51:43,017 --> 00:51:46,686
Fuck calling her. I'm going down there.

760
00:51:46,854 --> 00:51:50,440
Yeah. Yeah. Okay. ASAP.

761
00:51:51,191 --> 00:51:52,692
So who's the lucky guy?

762
00:51:53,986 --> 00:51:57,488
His name's Pat.
Met him at the driving range.

763
00:51:58,240 --> 00:51:59,282
Is he good-looking?

764
00:52:00,910 --> 00:52:02,785
He's no Steve Young.

765
00:52:03,662 --> 00:52:04,954
So. What is he like?

766
00:52:06,248 --> 00:52:07,874
I don't know.

767
00:52:08,375 --> 00:52:10,543
Kind of a mook. A schlep.

768
00:52:10,711 --> 00:52:12,879
Why the hell are you going out
with a schlep?

769
00:52:13,047 --> 00:52:18,426
It's not like that, Magda. You know.
It's like that movie Harold and Maude.

770
00:52:19,553 --> 00:52:20,803
I don't watch the new ones.

771
00:52:20,971 --> 00:52:24,641
Well, you should because it's probably
the greatest love story of our time.

772
00:52:24,808 --> 00:52:29,646
The point is.
Is that love isn't about money...

773
00:52:29,813 --> 00:52:32,482
...or social standings or age.

774
00:52:32,650 --> 00:52:36,736
It's about two people connecting,
having something in common.

775
00:52:36,904 --> 00:52:39,113
You know, kindred spirits.

776
00:52:39,281 --> 00:52:42,742
Fuck kindred spirits.
My little Puffy here is gonna tell you...

777
00:52:42,910 --> 00:52:46,412
...everything you need to know
about that guy in about two seconds flat.

778
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:49,707
If Puffy starts yapping. He's a loser.

779
00:52:49,875 --> 00:52:54,420
If he likes him. Honey,
then you've got yourself a keeper.

780
00:53:19,905 --> 00:53:25,368
Yeah. Pufferball likes it
when I rub his belly.

781
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:28,329
That is amazing.

782
00:53:28,497 --> 00:53:33,209
He doesn't like anybody.
He never usually likes guys.

783
00:53:33,377 --> 00:53:36,963
- He doesn't like bad guys.
- Is that right?

784
00:53:37,131 --> 00:53:39,674
He can tell that you're an animal nut.

785
00:53:39,967 --> 00:53:43,302
- You are. Aren't you?
- You got me pegged.

786
00:53:43,470 --> 00:53:47,932
You know, in Nepal.
the villagers there called me kin ton ti...

787
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:53,813
...which means
"noble man who is loved by many animal...

788
00:53:53,981 --> 00:53:56,899
...who, in kind, he loveth too."

789
00:53:58,819 --> 00:54:01,029
Would you like a cup of tea
or something?

790
00:54:01,196 --> 00:54:03,823
I'd love a brewski if you got one.

791
00:54:03,991 --> 00:54:05,491
We can do that.

792
00:54:05,659 --> 00:54:09,162
Hey, Magda.
why don't you help me in the kitchen?

793
00:54:09,872 --> 00:54:12,457
Oh, yeah. Oh. Yeah. Certainly. Of course.

794
00:54:18,922 --> 00:54:21,883
Puffer doesn't like bad guys, does he?

795
00:54:24,678 --> 00:54:29,390
Puffer?

796
00:54:30,851 --> 00:54:32,518
Puffer, come on. Boy.

797
00:54:32,686 --> 00:54:35,063
Would you like a little clam dip, doll?

798
00:54:35,230 --> 00:54:38,107
No, thank you.
I'd love a Bundt cake if you have one.

799
00:54:39,860 --> 00:54:41,152
- Bundt cake?
- Bundt cake?

800
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:48,701
One, two. Three. Four. Five.

801
00:54:49,369 --> 00:54:50,411
One, two. Three...

802
00:54:50,579 --> 00:54:55,458
Hey, Pat. Do you want a Budweiser
or a Heinie?

803
00:54:55,626 --> 00:54:57,043
Yeah. Whatever.

804
00:54:57,211 --> 00:54:59,587
Come on. Puffer.
Stay away from the light.

805
00:55:02,007 --> 00:55:03,716
Okay. I'll just get you a regular.

806
00:55:33,914 --> 00:55:35,289
All set?

807
00:55:43,298 --> 00:55:44,632
Good pooch.

808
00:55:45,175 --> 00:55:48,845
All we had were some Oreos.
How does that sound. Honey?

809
00:55:50,097 --> 00:55:53,099
Oh, my God.

810
00:55:53,767 --> 00:55:57,478
He's got him wrapped up like a baby.

811
00:55:57,980 --> 00:56:00,940
He was... He was a little chilly.

812
00:56:04,444 --> 00:56:05,611
Well, here we are.

813
00:56:05,779 --> 00:56:06,821
- The museum?
- Yeah.

814
00:56:06,989 --> 00:56:10,116
- I thought we were going to dinner.
- We will, but I have a surprise.

815
00:56:10,284 --> 00:56:13,202
- A surprise?
- Yeah, it's the architecture exhibit.

816
00:56:13,495 --> 00:56:15,163
- Architecture exhibit?
- Yeah.

817
00:56:15,330 --> 00:56:19,125
- I gotta eat something or I get the shakes.
- We'll eat in 20 minutes.

818
00:56:19,293 --> 00:56:21,752
My friend Tucker is upstairs.
I want you to meet him.

819
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:25,339
- He's an architect too. Come on. Yeah.
- Architect?

820
00:56:25,507 --> 00:56:26,841
Tucker.

821
00:56:27,009 --> 00:56:31,095
This is amazing.
This just blows me away.

822
00:56:31,263 --> 00:56:35,725
What do you think this falls under?
Is this art deco. Or is it art nouveau?

823
00:56:36,768 --> 00:56:39,562
- Deco. Deco. Yeah.
- Yeah.

824
00:56:40,022 --> 00:56:41,772
It's beautiful.

825
00:56:42,149 --> 00:56:45,860
Is this...?
Okay. Is this a vestibule. Or is it a portico?

826
00:56:46,028 --> 00:56:47,486
What is the difference?

827
00:56:47,654 --> 00:56:53,201
When you're looking at architecture,
try to visualize the buildings as a whole.

828
00:56:53,368 --> 00:56:57,830
You know, try to see them
in their natural state.

829
00:56:57,998 --> 00:57:03,669
In their totalitarianism, so to speak.

830
00:57:03,837 --> 00:57:08,174
- Stone-crab time. Let's go to Joe's, huh?
- Hey, Tucker.

831
00:57:10,594 --> 00:57:12,345
Mary.

832
00:57:12,512 --> 00:57:13,763
How are you?

833
00:57:14,181 --> 00:57:15,890
Good. I'm glad we saw you.

834
00:57:17,517 --> 00:57:19,352
Come on. Like you mean it.

835
00:57:19,519 --> 00:57:22,647
Tucker. This is my friend Pat Healy.

836
00:57:22,814 --> 00:57:25,441
- Oh. It's a pleasure to meet you. Patrick.
- Same here.

837
00:57:25,609 --> 00:57:28,694
- Pat is an architect as well.
- Oh. Really?

838
00:57:28,862 --> 00:57:32,240
- Where are your offices?
- Mainly. I work out of Boston.

839
00:57:32,407 --> 00:57:34,200
Boston, huh?

840
00:57:34,368 --> 00:57:37,703
- Did you get your degree up there?
- You bet.

841
00:57:38,038 --> 00:57:40,164
Really? Where did you study?

842
00:57:40,707 --> 00:57:42,083
Harvard.

843
00:57:42,251 --> 00:57:45,378
Then you must have studied
under Kim Green.

844
00:57:45,587 --> 00:57:46,796
Well, among others.

845
00:57:48,298 --> 00:57:51,926
You know,
Pat does projects all over the world.

846
00:57:52,094 --> 00:57:54,303
Really?
Where would I have seen your work?

847
00:57:55,055 --> 00:57:57,223
Well, have you been to...?

848
00:57:57,391 --> 00:57:59,141
Well, let me see.

849
00:57:59,309 --> 00:58:02,186
Santiago. Chile?

850
00:58:02,354 --> 00:58:05,648
Twice last year. Which building is yours?

851
00:58:07,067 --> 00:58:12,530
- Are you familiar with the soccer stadium?
- Did you build the Estadio Olímpico?

852
00:58:13,156 --> 00:58:18,369
No, just down the street.
the Celinto Catayente Towers.

853
00:58:18,745 --> 00:58:21,163
It's quite a fine example. In fact.

854
00:58:21,331 --> 00:58:23,290
I recommend next time
you're up that way...

855
00:58:23,458 --> 00:58:28,045
...that you drop in
and take a ganders at it yourself.

856
00:58:29,881 --> 00:58:33,259
- You know, I really should take your card.
- Sure.

857
00:58:34,886 --> 00:58:37,388
As I live and breathe.
Will you excuse us for a second?

858
00:58:37,556 --> 00:58:41,142
- I'll call you. Okay?
- Hey, Earl.

859
00:58:41,309 --> 00:58:44,270
Earl Stein, you old sheep-fucker.
How the hell are you?

860
00:58:44,438 --> 00:58:46,230
My name's Brian.

861
00:58:46,398 --> 00:58:48,858
Good one. What the hell
are you doing out here, Earl?

862
00:58:49,026 --> 00:58:50,693
No, no. My name's Brian.

863
00:58:50,861 --> 00:58:52,903
Brian Mone.

864
00:58:54,322 --> 00:58:58,659
Oh, I see. Okay, yeah.
Whatever you say. "Brian."

865
00:58:58,827 --> 00:59:00,619
I'll see you at the office, huh?

866
00:59:00,787 --> 00:59:03,330
I'll tell you some stories
about this weirdo.

867
00:59:04,291 --> 00:59:05,875
You know that guy?

868
00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:14,341
Hey, thanks for picking me up. Man.

869
00:59:14,509 --> 00:59:17,511
Yeah. No problem.
I've been driving for like 15 hours straight...

870
00:59:17,679 --> 00:59:19,555
...so I could use the company.

871
00:59:19,723 --> 00:59:24,435
I know what you mean. I've been standing
in the same spot for five and a half hours.

872
00:59:24,603 --> 00:59:27,229
You know they made it illegal
to hitchhike in this state?

873
00:59:27,397 --> 00:59:31,108
Really? That must make it really tough.

874
00:59:31,276 --> 00:59:35,362
So. What's going on with you?
You a salesman, or...?

875
00:59:35,781 --> 00:59:39,950
No. No. I'm nothing.

876
00:59:40,118 --> 00:59:41,786
I am.

877
00:59:42,579 --> 00:59:44,080
- Yeah?
- I'm a salesman.

878
00:59:44,247 --> 00:59:47,083
- I'm gonna start my own company.
- Really?

879
00:59:47,250 --> 00:59:49,001
You want in?

880
00:59:53,173 --> 00:59:54,340
No. I'm not...

881
00:59:54,508 --> 00:59:56,634
I don't really have any.
you know, money, or...

882
00:59:56,802 --> 00:59:59,553
You heard of this thing,
the 8 Minute Abs?

883
00:59:59,721 --> 01:00:02,473
Yeah, sure, 8 Minute Abs.
yeah. The exercise video.

884
01:00:02,641 --> 01:00:07,311
Yeah. Well. This is gonna blow that
right out of the water. Listen to this.

885
01:00:08,313 --> 01:00:11,982
7 Minute Abs.

886
01:00:13,985 --> 01:00:17,446
Right. Yes. Okay, all right.
I see where you're going.

887
01:00:17,614 --> 01:00:21,200
Think about it. You walk into a video store.
see 8 Minute Abs sitting there...

888
01:00:21,368 --> 01:00:25,246
...there's 7 Minute Abs right beside it.
Which one are you gonna pick, man?

889
01:00:25,413 --> 01:00:30,334
- I would go for the 7. Yeah.
- Bingo. Man. Bingo. 7 Minute Abs.

890
01:00:30,502 --> 01:00:33,921
And we guarantee just as good
a workout as the 8 Minute folk.

891
01:00:34,089 --> 01:00:36,465
You guarantee it? How do you do that?

892
01:00:36,633 --> 01:00:40,052
If you're not happy
with the first seven minutes...

893
01:00:40,220 --> 01:00:43,681
...we're gonna send you
the extra minute free.

894
01:00:43,849 --> 01:00:46,892
See, that's it. That's our motto.
That's where we're coming from.

895
01:00:47,060 --> 01:00:48,435
That's from A to B.

896
01:00:48,979 --> 01:00:51,063
That's right. That's good. That's good.

897
01:00:51,857 --> 01:00:54,859
Unless. Of course,
somebody comes up with 6 Minute Abs.

898
01:00:55,026 --> 01:00:57,319
Then you're in trouble, huh?

899
01:01:03,785 --> 01:01:06,579
No. No. No. Not six.

900
01:01:06,746 --> 01:01:09,290
I said seven.
Nobody's coming up with six.

901
01:01:09,457 --> 01:01:10,875
Who works out in six minutes?

902
01:01:11,042 --> 01:01:15,296
You won't even get your heart going.
Not even a mouse on a wheel.

903
01:01:15,463 --> 01:01:17,381
- Good point.
- Seven's the key number here.

904
01:01:17,549 --> 01:01:20,885
- Think about it. 7-Elevens. Seven dwarfs.
- Seven, yeah.

905
01:01:21,052 --> 01:01:23,095
Seven, man, that's the number.

906
01:01:23,263 --> 01:01:25,556
Seven chipmunks twirling on a branch...

907
01:01:25,724 --> 01:01:28,267
...eating lots of sunflowers
on my uncle's ranch.

908
01:01:28,435 --> 01:01:31,562
You know that old children's tale
from the sea.

909
01:01:31,730 --> 01:01:34,190
It's like you're dreaming
about Gorgonzola cheese...

910
01:01:34,357 --> 01:01:38,068
...when it's clearly Brie time, baby.

911
01:01:38,570 --> 01:01:40,321
Step into my office.

912
01:01:40,488 --> 01:01:43,574
- Why?
- Because you're fucking fired.

913
01:01:44,284 --> 01:01:46,785
Yeah. You know what? I gotta pee.
I'm gonna pull over.

914
01:01:46,953 --> 01:01:51,957
Your car seats are making me itchy. Man.
What are these made out of, cactus?

915
01:01:56,880 --> 01:02:00,799
I'm only waiting seven minutes total.

916
01:02:09,434 --> 01:02:13,270
- Hey, wait your turn.
- Sorry. I didn't get a...

917
01:02:15,690 --> 01:02:18,359
- We gotta get out of here.
- Wait a minute. Hey. Hey.

918
01:02:20,737 --> 01:02:23,656
- This is a raid.
- No. No, no, no. I was peeing.

919
01:02:23,823 --> 01:02:25,783
That's what I was doing.
I was just peeing.

920
01:02:25,951 --> 01:02:28,786
- I was peeing too.
- Yeah, I'm sure you were all just pissing.

921
01:02:28,954 --> 01:02:32,790
- Let's go. Let's move it out.
- Let's go. In the truck. Everybody.

922
01:02:34,167 --> 01:02:38,462
Holy Shit. Jimmy Shay, is that you?

923
01:02:53,395 --> 01:02:56,605
- No, really...
- Oh. My God.

924
01:02:56,982 --> 01:02:58,649
Ted?

925
01:03:01,486 --> 01:03:04,530
If you let me talk to you for one second
outside of the truck.

926
01:03:04,698 --> 01:03:08,075
- Into the truck. Get in the truck.
- Look, I still have to pee. I wasn't...

927
01:03:08,243 --> 01:03:09,910
- Let's go.
- Can I have a cup?

928
01:03:10,078 --> 01:03:11,704
See, hon? I told you he was gay.

929
01:03:11,871 --> 01:03:16,625
We'll be right back with more Cops,
live from the heartland.

930
01:03:41,609 --> 01:03:43,694
That grandmother of yours
is really something.

931
01:03:43,862 --> 01:03:45,904
Who. Magda?
No, Magda's not my grandmother.

932
01:03:46,072 --> 01:03:50,200
She rents the apartment next door.
Her husband died a couple years ago...

933
01:03:50,368 --> 01:03:53,996
...and I don't think she likes being alone,
so. You know. She just hangs out.

934
01:03:54,164 --> 01:03:57,458
- Doesn't cramp your style?
- Sadly, no.

935
01:03:57,876 --> 01:04:02,296
You know, sometimes I wish
I could be like Magda and not go home.

936
01:04:02,672 --> 01:04:07,551
Yeah. I'd like to bounce around for a while
and do some traveling.

937
01:04:07,719 --> 01:04:10,679
I don't know why anybody
would wanna bounce around...

938
01:04:10,847 --> 01:04:13,307
...you know.
If they had their own condo in Nepal.

939
01:04:13,475 --> 01:04:16,643
- I'd be there in a second.
- I'd sell it.

940
01:04:16,811 --> 01:04:19,521
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Start fresh in a new place...

941
01:04:19,689 --> 01:04:21,815
...give up the architect game.

942
01:04:21,983 --> 01:04:26,362
Slow things down a bit.
read more books. See more movies.

943
01:04:26,529 --> 01:04:28,364
Are you a movie buff?

944
01:04:28,531 --> 01:04:32,242
Well, I try to be. But it's tough going
with all the crap they make today.

945
01:04:32,410 --> 01:04:35,537
I guess I just wish they made movies
like they used to make.

946
01:04:35,705 --> 01:04:39,333
You know, classics like The Karate Kid
or Harold and Maude.

947
01:04:41,836 --> 01:04:44,838
Harold and Maude
is my all-time favorite movie.

948
01:04:45,006 --> 01:04:48,384
- Don't bust my chops. I know it's corny...
- Pat. I'm not kidding.

949
01:04:48,551 --> 01:04:53,055
I think Harold and Maude is one of
the greatest love stories of our time.

950
01:04:56,267 --> 01:04:58,894
Here I thought I was the only one.

951
01:05:00,063 --> 01:05:03,273
You're too good to be true.
Come on. Let's go dance.

952
01:05:10,490 --> 01:05:12,199
Hey, guys.

953
01:05:18,289 --> 01:05:19,915
So...

954
01:05:21,960 --> 01:05:26,964
- Yeah, well, I guess this is it. Huh?
- I guess.

955
01:05:27,132 --> 01:05:29,800
- I'll see you around.
- Okay.

956
01:05:31,094 --> 01:05:33,470
- Mary?
- Yeah?

957
01:05:34,639 --> 01:05:35,931
- Forget it.
- What?

958
01:05:36,099 --> 01:05:38,934
- No, no, it's stupid.
- What? Come on. You can say it.

959
01:05:39,102 --> 01:05:41,937
- No, really. It's moronic.
- Just say it.

960
01:05:42,105 --> 01:05:44,857
Can I feel your bosoms before I go?

961
01:05:48,862 --> 01:05:50,737
Knock yourself out.

962
01:06:03,376 --> 01:06:07,588
- Okey-doke. So tomorrow night?
- Sure.

963
01:06:18,057 --> 01:06:21,185
Man, they never look like you'd expect.
do they?

964
01:06:22,979 --> 01:06:26,565
That's probably how he got his victim
to drop his guard.

965
01:06:27,692 --> 01:06:29,776
Where'd they find the body?

966
01:06:30,028 --> 01:06:34,031
In a big red bag
on the front passenger seat.

967
01:06:34,199 --> 01:06:36,867
All hacked up.

968
01:06:37,202 --> 01:06:38,952
Gruesome.

969
01:06:39,496 --> 01:06:42,206
Real psycho, this one.

970
01:06:43,208 --> 01:06:47,044
Hey, you're a little worked up.
Let me do the talking.

971
01:06:50,715 --> 01:06:54,301
- I'm Detective Stabler. This is Krevoy.
- Look, I didn't solicit any sex, okay?

972
01:06:54,469 --> 01:06:55,928
This is a huge misunderstanding.

973
01:06:56,095 --> 01:06:58,889
I was going out to pee.
I'm walking in the bushes...

974
01:06:59,057 --> 01:07:01,808
...l trip over this guy.
and there were all these cops and...

975
01:07:01,976 --> 01:07:05,729
Ted, Ted. Ted. It's okay. We believe you.

976
01:07:12,612 --> 01:07:16,698
The problem is.
we found your friend in the car.

977
01:07:18,117 --> 01:07:20,202
Oh, the hitchhiker?

978
01:07:20,370 --> 01:07:22,788
That's what this is about? The hitchhiker?

979
01:07:24,249 --> 01:07:27,501
Oh, great. Just my luck.

980
01:07:27,669 --> 01:07:29,753
I get caught for everything.

981
01:07:29,921 --> 01:07:33,799
So you admit it?

982
01:07:34,092 --> 01:07:36,885
Yeah. Guilty as charged.

983
01:07:37,053 --> 01:07:39,805
Look. I know that you guys
have got a job to do. All right?

984
01:07:39,973 --> 01:07:43,225
And I'm really sorry. I did it. I admit it.

985
01:07:43,393 --> 01:07:48,105
You know, the guy even told me.
The hitchhiker told me it was illegal, so...

986
01:07:49,232 --> 01:07:50,774
Well...

987
01:07:53,486 --> 01:07:55,028
...can you tell us his name?

988
01:07:59,075 --> 01:08:01,034
No, I didn't catch it.

989
01:08:01,703 --> 01:08:05,706
Can we cut to the chase? I mean,
am I. Like, in a lot of trouble here. or...?

990
01:08:06,499 --> 01:08:08,500
First. Tell us why you did it.

991
01:08:08,668 --> 01:08:10,586
Why I did it?

992
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:15,090
I don't know. Boredom?

993
01:08:16,968 --> 01:08:19,177
Guy turns out to be a blabbermouth.

994
01:08:19,345 --> 01:08:21,680
Just would not shut up. I mean, just...

995
01:08:21,848 --> 01:08:27,227
Ted, this wasn't your first time. Was it?

996
01:08:28,646 --> 01:08:30,188
No.

997
01:08:31,024 --> 01:08:36,695
- How many are we talking here?
- Hitchhikers? My whole life?

998
01:08:37,697 --> 01:08:42,075
I don't know. Twenty-five. 50.
I mean. Who keeps track?

999
01:08:43,036 --> 01:08:45,829
Hey, I know this is the Bible belt,
but where I come from...

1000
01:08:45,997 --> 01:08:48,081
...this is not that big a deal.

1001
01:08:48,249 --> 01:08:50,042
- I mean...
- You son of a bitch.

1002
01:08:51,210 --> 01:08:53,086
You're gonna fry.

1003
01:08:54,130 --> 01:08:58,717
Hey. Hey. Take it easy. Cut it out.
What the hell are you doing? Take it easy.

1004
01:08:58,885 --> 01:09:01,053
- You okay?
- What the hell is wrong with you?

1005
01:09:01,220 --> 01:09:02,262
- You all right?
- Punk.

1006
01:09:02,430 --> 01:09:03,972
Jesus.

1007
01:09:24,911 --> 01:09:27,371
Your friend Tucker stopped by.

1008
01:09:27,914 --> 01:09:29,414
Really?

1009
01:09:30,249 --> 01:09:33,418
Okay. Hey. What does it look like today?

1010
01:09:33,586 --> 01:09:36,213
It's fine. A little crazy in the afternoon.

1011
01:09:37,799 --> 01:09:38,840
Hey, Tucker.

1012
01:09:40,093 --> 01:09:41,468
What's up. Doc?

1013
01:09:42,929 --> 01:09:45,681
You look different.
Did you do something with your hair?

1014
01:09:46,349 --> 01:09:48,892
The teeth. The teeth. I got them capped.

1015
01:09:49,060 --> 01:09:51,311
Oh, yeah? Hey, they look great.

1016
01:09:51,479 --> 01:09:55,524
- You don't think they look a little big?
- No, not at all. The bigger the better.

1017
01:09:55,983 --> 01:09:57,401
But they could be brighter.

1018
01:09:57,568 --> 01:10:02,823
There's nothing more sexy to me than a guy
with a mouthful of big pearly whites.

1019
01:10:02,990 --> 01:10:04,032
- Really?
- Yeah.

1020
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:07,119
Come here.
You ever had one up the hatch in here?

1021
01:10:07,286 --> 01:10:09,579
- Tucker. Behave yourself.
- I'm sorry.

1022
01:10:12,417 --> 01:10:14,251
What can I do for you today. My friend?

1023
01:10:14,419 --> 01:10:18,296
I wanted to talk to you
about your friend Patrick.

1024
01:10:18,464 --> 01:10:19,631
He's a nice guy. Huh?

1025
01:10:19,799 --> 01:10:23,343
Well, that's what I'm trying to figure out.
How long have you known him?

1026
01:10:23,511 --> 01:10:25,595
Not very long, but I like him.

1027
01:10:26,139 --> 01:10:30,475
Well, I know he's a little different.
but that's what I like about him.

1028
01:10:30,643 --> 01:10:33,103
He dresses like a complete dork.

1029
01:10:33,271 --> 01:10:35,647
He chews with his mouth open.

1030
01:10:35,815 --> 01:10:40,652
He hardly ever says the right thing,
and he probably farts too.

1031
01:10:41,070 --> 01:10:44,489
That's what you're looking for, is it?
A farter?

1032
01:10:44,866 --> 01:10:46,742
No, I'm looking for a guy.

1033
01:10:47,577 --> 01:10:52,080
Look. It's just that something struck me
as strange about him last night.

1034
01:10:52,874 --> 01:10:54,583
He gave me this funny vibe.

1035
01:10:55,251 --> 01:10:57,502
Anyway, I called some friends up north...

1036
01:10:57,670 --> 01:11:01,006
...and they've never heard of an architect
named Patrick Healy.

1037
01:11:01,466 --> 01:11:03,759
And he's not listed as a Harvard alumnus.

1038
01:11:03,926 --> 01:11:05,469
- Fuck!
- Really?

1039
01:11:06,679 --> 01:11:08,680
- That's strange.
- Yes, I thought so.

1040
01:11:08,848 --> 01:11:12,142
Anyway, I hope you don't think
I'm being meddlesome.

1041
01:11:12,310 --> 01:11:16,062
It's just that I think you should be careful
with this guy. That's all.

1042
01:11:16,814 --> 01:11:17,981
I mean. Let's face it.

1043
01:11:18,149 --> 01:11:23,653
You're beautiful. And you've got money,
and you trust people.

1044
01:11:24,113 --> 01:11:26,531
I'm just saying,
there's a lot of psychos out there.

1045
01:11:26,699 --> 01:11:29,075
- Just be careful.
- Fucker.

1046
01:11:29,243 --> 01:11:33,538
Look. Tucker, thank you.
I really appreciate you looking out for me.

1047
01:11:34,707 --> 01:11:36,583
Okay. Listen. I'll call you.

1048
01:11:36,751 --> 01:11:39,211
- Okay.
- Okay.

1049
01:11:43,549 --> 01:11:45,217
Damn.

1050
01:11:50,389 --> 01:11:55,393
- You want me to get those for you?
- No. I have to learn to do this myself.

1051
01:11:59,816 --> 01:12:01,399
Damn.

1052
01:12:03,528 --> 01:12:06,571
My leg. Could you. Mary?

1053
01:12:07,949 --> 01:12:09,616
Thank you.

1054
01:12:10,451 --> 01:12:12,577
Wait. Wait.

1055
01:12:13,871 --> 01:12:15,247
There.

1056
01:12:23,714 --> 01:12:24,798
- See?
- Yeah.

1057
01:12:24,966 --> 01:12:27,592
- I knew I could do it.
- I see. Here, let me get the door.

1058
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:29,094
Thank you.

1059
01:12:29,804 --> 01:12:31,012
- See you later.
- Goodbye.

1060
01:12:31,180 --> 01:12:33,932
Jane. Can you get the door
for Tucker, please?

1061
01:12:34,100 --> 01:12:36,226
Do you...? You want me to...?

1062
01:12:36,394 --> 01:12:39,437
- No. I've done this a thousand times.
- Okay.

1063
01:12:46,362 --> 01:12:48,113
Mr. Stroehmann...

1064
01:12:48,281 --> 01:12:52,659
...on behalf of the entire South Carolina
Law Enforcement community...

1065
01:12:52,827 --> 01:12:57,747
...l would like to apologize to you
for any pain or temporary inconvenience...

1066
01:12:57,915 --> 01:12:59,916
...that you may have been caused.

1067
01:13:03,963 --> 01:13:05,797
At approximately 10:40 this morning...

1068
01:13:05,965 --> 01:13:09,384
...a man was apprehended
not far from where you were arrested.

1069
01:13:09,552 --> 01:13:12,095
He was identified
as an escaped mental patient...

1070
01:13:12,263 --> 01:13:15,515
...and subsequently he confessed
to the murder you're being held for.

1071
01:13:15,683 --> 01:13:18,393
Lab tests confirm a fingerprint match.

1072
01:13:18,561 --> 01:13:22,105
You mean I'm free to go?

1073
01:13:22,857 --> 01:13:24,941
No harm. No foul.

1074
01:13:26,986 --> 01:13:29,571
Oh, by the way,
there's someone there to see you.

1075
01:13:33,910 --> 01:13:35,869
Shut up.

1076
01:13:44,086 --> 01:13:47,130
You are a lucky son of a bitch.
you know that?

1077
01:13:47,298 --> 01:13:51,134
- I am?
- Yeah. Didn't they tell you?

1078
01:13:51,302 --> 01:13:55,513
That hitcher was about to cut your throat
before you decided to take a piss.

1079
01:13:55,681 --> 01:13:57,933
Had a fucking horseshoe up your ass,
my man.

1080
01:14:02,688 --> 01:14:05,523
You got that nervous-hive thing again?

1081
01:14:05,900 --> 01:14:11,279
Yeah. Yeah. I do. Ted,
because I got some bad news.

1082
01:14:12,406 --> 01:14:14,032
Are you okay?

1083
01:14:17,662 --> 01:14:18,787
Ted, I'm dying.

1084
01:14:23,542 --> 01:14:25,210
Oh, my...

1085
01:14:26,504 --> 01:14:30,507
Ted, I'm not dying, man. Come on.

1086
01:14:30,675 --> 01:14:33,843
Jesus. It's just the humidity down here
or something. Come on.

1087
01:14:34,011 --> 01:14:37,931
No. No. Ted. The bad news I got
is about our friend Healy.

1088
01:14:38,099 --> 01:14:40,725
I sent my assistant to his apartment
with his last check.

1089
01:14:40,893 --> 01:14:42,727
The landlady said when he came back...

1090
01:14:42,895 --> 01:14:47,107
...he kept talking about
falling for some doctor named Mary.

1091
01:14:48,067 --> 01:14:50,652
- Mary? My Mary?
- Well...

1092
01:14:51,821 --> 01:14:55,782
Ted, here's Healy's address down there.

1093
01:14:55,950 --> 01:15:00,078
In the future, do a little research before
you send a guy like that out into the woods.

1094
01:15:00,246 --> 01:15:02,956
I mean. Jesus Chris, it's creepy. Okay?

1095
01:15:05,126 --> 01:15:07,836
You're not thinking about
going out with this guy again?

1096
01:15:08,004 --> 01:15:10,005
Mary, honey. He's a psycho.

1097
01:15:10,172 --> 01:15:14,426
- Mary, the guy's full of shit.
- Jesus. This sucks.

1098
01:15:14,593 --> 01:15:17,095
It's too bad this had to happen.

1099
01:15:17,847 --> 01:15:20,098
He was almost perfect.

1100
01:15:20,641 --> 01:15:23,309
Mary, what did you say
Pat's last name was?

1101
01:15:23,477 --> 01:15:25,729
- Healy.
- Come here. Come here, come here.

1102
01:15:25,896 --> 01:15:27,564
- Come on. You gotta hear this.
- What?

1103
01:15:27,732 --> 01:15:31,276
- That's the way us Healys were raised.
- So where the hell are you, Healy?

1104
01:15:31,444 --> 01:15:34,738
I got a date tonight
with that Mary girl I told you about.

1105
01:15:34,905 --> 01:15:36,448
- The sawbones?
- Yep.

1106
01:15:36,615 --> 01:15:38,950
- Oh. My God. We hit the mother lode.
- You guys...

1107
01:15:39,118 --> 01:15:41,327
...should we be listening to this?

1108
01:15:42,121 --> 01:15:45,248
- She still think you're a fucking architect?
- Oh. Yeah.

1109
01:15:45,416 --> 01:15:47,042
Dumb shit.

1110
01:15:47,209 --> 01:15:48,418
Mr. Perfect. Huh?

1111
01:15:48,586 --> 01:15:52,380
Hey, watch your mouth.
She's a great gal, Mary.

1112
01:15:52,548 --> 01:15:57,010
- I'm the dumb shit for lying to her.
- Why didn't you just tell her the truth?

1113
01:15:57,636 --> 01:15:58,678
I don't know.

1114
01:15:58,846 --> 01:16:02,474
I guess it seems that women today
are more impressed by the almighty buck...

1115
01:16:02,641 --> 01:16:07,312
...than some schmo who's spent 17 years
scraping by on Peace Corps wages.

1116
01:16:07,480 --> 01:16:08,521
Jesus. Man.

1117
01:16:08,689 --> 01:16:11,316
If she's as special as you say.
she's gonna wanna hear...

1118
01:16:11,484 --> 01:16:12,817
...about the things you did.

1119
01:16:12,985 --> 01:16:16,863
"You could tell her about
the irrigation ditches you dug in Sudan.

1120
01:16:17,031 --> 01:16:20,325
The orphan babies
who cried in your arms in...

1121
01:16:21,660 --> 01:16:23,036
...Romania.

1122
01:16:23,204 --> 01:16:27,082
The hope you gave Freddy the leper
in Calcutta."

1123
01:16:27,249 --> 01:16:29,834
I'll be honest with you.
I'm a selfish prick.

1124
01:16:30,002 --> 01:16:33,546
I get a high
from helping all God's creatures.

1125
01:16:34,757 --> 01:16:37,675
An honest-to-goodness high.
I did all those things for myself.

1126
01:16:37,843 --> 01:16:39,677
Hey, hey, hey.

1127
01:16:44,517 --> 01:16:46,684
That's bullshit, man.

1128
01:16:46,852 --> 01:16:49,270
Hey. Hey, you were on the front line.

1129
01:16:50,189 --> 01:16:54,359
You remember?
The malaria, the typhoon fever?

1130
01:16:54,527 --> 01:16:58,196
That vicious strain of genital herpes?

1131
01:16:59,532 --> 01:17:01,074
Fuck.

1132
01:17:03,452 --> 01:17:07,664
Yeah, I cured all sorts of horrible illnesses
in Third World countries.

1133
01:17:07,832 --> 01:17:12,001
But the bottom line is, I'm not gonna use
my philanthropy as some kind of currency.

1134
01:17:12,169 --> 01:17:14,003
Especially after what I did.

1135
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:17,298
I lied to that poor girl.

1136
01:17:19,343 --> 01:17:20,677
Lied, man.

1137
01:17:20,845 --> 01:17:25,515
Well, love will make you do...

1138
01:17:26,725 --> 01:17:27,892
...fucked-up things.

1139
01:17:28,102 --> 01:17:32,355
You said it, mister. I gotta run.

1140
01:17:33,482 --> 01:17:35,400
We're dicks.

1141
01:17:41,407 --> 01:17:43,658
Come here. Baby.
Come here. Sweetheart.

1142
01:17:44,076 --> 01:17:47,328
I'll feed you and Bill soon.
Come on. Honey.

1143
01:17:53,335 --> 01:17:55,044
It's him. It's him.

1144
01:17:55,212 --> 01:17:58,047
Oh, hi. Mary.

1145
01:17:58,757 --> 01:18:00,258
Hello.

1146
01:18:01,343 --> 01:18:03,136
Mary, look.

1147
01:18:04,889 --> 01:18:07,182
Look. There's something
I have to tell you.

1148
01:18:07,349 --> 01:18:09,809
I'm not the architect you...

1149
01:18:17,109 --> 01:18:20,236
- Okay, guys, let's huddle up.
- Come on, Jimmy.

1150
01:18:20,404 --> 01:18:22,280
Jimmy, I'm open. Hit me. Come on.

1151
01:18:33,751 --> 01:18:36,336
Exceptional, my ass.

1152
01:18:48,682 --> 01:18:53,603
Looks like I double-jumped you. Warren,
for the win. Pay up, big guy.

1153
01:18:56,106 --> 01:18:58,650
- Coconut.
- Yeah, very good. Coconut.

1154
01:18:58,817 --> 01:19:00,610
Coconut.

1155
01:19:01,278 --> 01:19:02,779
Where's the rest of it, Warren?

1156
01:19:14,750 --> 01:19:16,209
Look at her.

1157
01:19:17,002 --> 01:19:21,464
She's more beautiful than I remember.
She's perfect.

1158
01:19:21,799 --> 01:19:25,260
Thanks for picking up the lunch tab, Mare.
Sorry I forgot my wallet.

1159
01:19:25,427 --> 01:19:29,055
- I feel like a dog.
- Don't worry about it. It was fun.

1160
01:19:35,562 --> 01:19:37,563
Fuck me.

1161
01:19:38,899 --> 01:19:41,150
How's my stomach taste?

1162
01:19:41,318 --> 01:19:43,486
"How's my stomach taste." she says.

1163
01:19:43,904 --> 01:19:46,406
Holy shit. Look. Look. There's Warren.

1164
01:19:46,573 --> 01:19:48,658
Franks and beans.

1165
01:19:49,076 --> 01:19:51,119
- Frank and beans.
- Warren, you just ate.

1166
01:19:51,286 --> 01:19:54,247
Leave him alone.
He's just got a big appetite. Right, Warren?

1167
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:57,250
I said you got a big...

1168
01:19:59,211 --> 01:20:01,379
Warren. Warren. Warren.

1169
01:20:01,839 --> 01:20:03,506
Yes.

1170
01:20:03,674 --> 01:20:06,676
Listen, you can't touch his ears
unless he trusts you. I'm sorry.

1171
01:20:06,844 --> 01:20:09,846
- Are you okay?
- Not to worry.

1172
01:20:10,055 --> 01:20:13,349
- So I'll see you tonight. Right?
- Sure.

1173
01:20:16,437 --> 01:20:18,396
Come here. Warren. You okay?

1174
01:20:18,564 --> 01:20:20,273
- He broke it.
- I saw.

1175
01:20:21,400 --> 01:20:23,359
Okay. What are you waiting for? Let's go.

1176
01:20:23,527 --> 01:20:26,654
- What? No. I don't know what to say.
- What are you talking about?

1177
01:20:26,822 --> 01:20:30,408
Tell her the truth about Healy.
Blow the schmuck out of the water.

1178
01:20:30,576 --> 01:20:32,243
No, I can't.

1179
01:20:32,411 --> 01:20:36,122
I unleashed the psycho on her.
She's gonna be fucking pissed.

1180
01:20:37,249 --> 01:20:40,918
- Mary. Mary.
- No, no. Stop.

1181
01:20:42,546 --> 01:20:44,088
Mary?

1182
01:20:46,258 --> 01:20:50,178
Mary? Is that...? It is you.

1183
01:20:51,263 --> 01:20:55,058
- Who is that?
- Hi. It's Ted.

1184
01:20:55,225 --> 01:20:56,601
Ted?

1185
01:20:56,769 --> 01:20:59,312
Yeah. Ted from Rhode Island. Ted.

1186
01:20:59,480 --> 01:21:02,523
Te...? Oh. My God. Ted.

1187
01:21:02,691 --> 01:21:05,276
- Hey. Good. How are you?
- It's good to see you.

1188
01:21:05,444 --> 01:21:07,445
- Good to see you.
- How you been?

1189
01:21:07,613 --> 01:21:09,280
I'm...

1190
01:21:09,448 --> 01:21:11,282
I haven't seen you since...

1191
01:21:11,450 --> 01:21:13,326
Yeah. Since...

1192
01:21:13,494 --> 01:21:17,413
- Senior prom.
- That's right. Senior prom.

1193
01:21:17,581 --> 01:21:20,958
You got a great memory.
Oh, man. That was...

1194
01:21:21,126 --> 01:21:23,461
Haven't thought about that in years.
Yeah.

1195
01:21:23,629 --> 01:21:26,422
So how's everything?

1196
01:21:27,800 --> 01:21:30,468
- Everything. You know.
- Oh. That's fine.

1197
01:21:30,636 --> 01:21:33,096
I was in and out of the hospital
in a couple of weeks.

1198
01:21:33,263 --> 01:21:35,223
It was not a big deal at all.

1199
01:21:35,390 --> 01:21:39,143
Now I'm good. Strong like bull. Really good.

1200
01:21:39,311 --> 01:21:41,687
- Hey. Hi, Warren.
- Hi, Ted.

1201
01:21:41,855 --> 01:21:45,066
- How are you?
- I'm... How are you?

1202
01:21:45,818 --> 01:21:49,195
- I can't believe that he remembers you.
- Piggyback ride?

1203
01:21:49,363 --> 01:21:52,698
Oh, piggyb... No. You know what?
I'll take a rain check this time. Okay?

1204
01:21:52,866 --> 01:21:54,492
He never remembers anybody.

1205
01:21:54,660 --> 01:21:56,744
- It's amazing.
- Yeah.

1206
01:21:56,912 --> 01:21:58,454
So. What are you doing here?

1207
01:21:58,622 --> 01:22:01,207
- Do you work here. Or...?
- Yeah, no, this is my office.

1208
01:22:01,375 --> 01:22:02,667
Well, it's up there.

1209
01:22:03,502 --> 01:22:06,838
So yeah. I was just out
on my lunch break with Warren. It's crazy.

1210
01:22:07,005 --> 01:22:09,632
- What are you doing here?
- Well. That's a funny story.

1211
01:22:09,800 --> 01:22:12,135
I was... I decided to...

1212
01:22:12,302 --> 01:22:15,847
I got in the car with my friend.
and we just...

1213
01:22:16,014 --> 01:22:19,684
We came down to Florida, right?

1214
01:22:22,563 --> 01:22:24,355
Right.

1215
01:22:25,190 --> 01:22:27,567
Well, you look great.
You look really good.

1216
01:22:27,734 --> 01:22:30,528
I mean. What's the story?
Are you married? Do you have kids?

1217
01:22:30,696 --> 01:22:33,364
- No. No. Dodged a few bullets.
- Yeah?

1218
01:22:33,532 --> 01:22:37,577
Yeah. God. This is just so bizarre.

1219
01:22:37,744 --> 01:22:41,789
- I'm standing here with Mary Jensen.
- No, no, now it's Mary Matthews.

1220
01:22:41,957 --> 01:22:43,124
Oh, did you...?

1221
01:22:43,292 --> 01:22:46,627
No, no, no. I haven't walked
down that plank yet, no.

1222
01:22:46,795 --> 01:22:49,672
But it was this thing in college.

1223
01:22:49,840 --> 01:22:51,716
This creepy guy who...

1224
01:22:51,884 --> 01:22:54,802
Anyhow. There was a restraining order.
It got kind of ugly...

1225
01:22:54,970 --> 01:22:58,389
...and after Princeton. I decided,
"You know what? Be cautious.

1226
01:22:58,557 --> 01:23:01,017
Change your name.
Just kind of leave that behind."

1227
01:23:01,185 --> 01:23:03,144
- Right. Right.
- Just didn't need that.

1228
01:23:03,312 --> 01:23:05,563
- That sounds horrible.
- It was... Yeah.

1229
01:23:05,731 --> 01:23:08,900
It was. But it's over. I think. So it's good.

1230
01:23:09,067 --> 01:23:12,403
Hey, what are you doing tonight?
Do you think you wanna, I don't know...

1231
01:23:12,571 --> 01:23:15,198
...go out to dinner?
You know, catch up on old times?

1232
01:23:15,991 --> 01:23:17,491
Didn't we just do that?

1233
01:23:21,205 --> 01:23:23,456
I'm fucking with you. Ted.

1234
01:23:26,919 --> 01:23:29,295
No, listen, I'd really... I'd like to.

1235
01:23:29,463 --> 01:23:32,924
It'd be great.
but I sort of already have plans tonight.

1236
01:23:33,091 --> 01:23:36,177
- But I'm free tomorrow night.
- Yeah, sure. Or, you know...

1237
01:23:36,345 --> 01:23:39,263
Or you could blow off that jerk
you're going out with tonight...

1238
01:23:39,431 --> 01:23:40,681
...and come out with me.

1239
01:23:44,186 --> 01:23:46,437
What hotel are you staying at?

1240
01:23:46,605 --> 01:23:48,231
The Cardozo.

1241
01:23:50,359 --> 01:23:51,943
- Pick you up at 8?
- Sure.

1242
01:23:52,110 --> 01:23:53,236
- Okay.
- Okay.

1243
01:23:53,403 --> 01:23:56,072
- Cool. See you.
- Bye.

1244
01:23:56,406 --> 01:23:59,033
Look closely at this picture

1245
01:23:59,201 --> 01:24:01,577
Ted and Mary like before

1246
01:24:01,745 --> 01:24:04,038
Can you see her as Ted sees her

1247
01:24:04,206 --> 01:24:06,457
And why he couldn't wait no more?

1248
01:24:06,625 --> 01:24:12,088
And if you still think he's being silly
Then you've still got more to see

1249
01:24:12,256 --> 01:24:16,425
Because this isn't just a date, folks
This is chemistry

1250
01:24:16,593 --> 01:24:19,220
And Mary

1251
01:24:19,680 --> 01:24:23,975
Well, there's just something about Mary

1252
01:24:33,151 --> 01:24:35,236
Banana, banana.

1253
01:24:35,404 --> 01:24:38,823
We're gonna be buying bananas tonight.

1254
01:24:38,991 --> 01:24:40,658
Why's that?

1255
01:24:40,826 --> 01:24:47,290
Back when I was your age. I always used to
make myself a big banana split after sex.

1256
01:24:47,457 --> 01:24:49,750
I think you're gonna need one tonight.

1257
01:24:49,918 --> 01:24:53,587
Don't get ahead of yourself.
You'll be eating a banana split before I do.

1258
01:24:53,755 --> 01:24:55,673
Don't bet on it.

1259
01:24:56,717 --> 01:24:58,134
Last time I had a Pap smear...

1260
01:24:58,302 --> 01:25:02,013
...the guy needed leather gloves
and an oyster shucker.

1261
01:25:05,017 --> 01:25:07,310
I am a little psyched.

1262
01:25:07,477 --> 01:25:11,439
I ran into this guy
I haven't seen since high school.

1263
01:25:11,982 --> 01:25:16,360
- An old flame?
- Kind of. Ted Stroehmann.

1264
01:25:16,528 --> 01:25:19,113
The sweetest guy in the world.

1265
01:25:19,281 --> 01:25:20,531
I mean. He was so cute.

1266
01:25:20,699 --> 01:25:25,286
He was so shy and clumsy,
and he had this huge mouth full of metal.

1267
01:25:25,454 --> 01:25:27,747
You know how I like braces.

1268
01:25:27,956 --> 01:25:30,082
Anyhow. We're going out tonight.

1269
01:25:30,542 --> 01:25:32,126
Oh, no.

1270
01:25:32,294 --> 01:25:35,504
God, that reminds me. I have to call
and cancel with what's-his-face.

1271
01:25:36,048 --> 01:25:37,089
What's-his-face?

1272
01:25:37,257 --> 01:25:39,842
Wait a minute.
do I sense a chill in the air?

1273
01:25:40,010 --> 01:25:42,011
Oh, Magda.

1274
01:25:42,262 --> 01:25:44,972
I let my head
get in the way of this one.

1275
01:25:45,140 --> 01:25:49,352
You know, I always pick guys
from what I feel in here.

1276
01:25:49,519 --> 01:25:52,104
But for some reason with Pat,
I kept saying to myself:

1277
01:25:52,272 --> 01:25:55,733
"Mary. Grow up. You have
so much in common with this guy.

1278
01:25:55,901 --> 01:25:59,111
You'll learn to feel something for him."
But...

1279
01:25:59,279 --> 01:26:00,988
...it just didn't happen.

1280
01:26:05,118 --> 01:26:07,870
- Who is it?
- It's Tucker.

1281
01:26:08,747 --> 01:26:10,623
- Tucker.
- Hello. How are you?

1282
01:26:10,791 --> 01:26:12,917
- Good. How are you?
- I'm fine, thank you.

1283
01:26:13,085 --> 01:26:16,170
- Look who's here.
- There she is.

1284
01:26:16,338 --> 01:26:19,423
I brought you
a little thirst quencher, Mag.

1285
01:26:19,591 --> 01:26:23,052
- Oh. Are you sweet.
- No, I'm not.

1286
01:26:23,220 --> 01:26:25,429
I just wanna get you drunk
so you'll pass out...

1287
01:26:25,597 --> 01:26:27,890
...and I can give Mary a good rogering.

1288
01:26:28,892 --> 01:26:31,727
- You want me to pour you one?
- Thanks, but I have to be going.

1289
01:26:31,895 --> 01:26:35,731
- Unfortunately. This is not a social visit.
- Really? What's up?

1290
01:26:35,899 --> 01:26:39,402
Well, I've got a little more news
about your friend Healy.

1291
01:26:39,569 --> 01:26:41,195
Tucker, everything's okay.

1292
01:26:41,363 --> 01:26:44,281
He confessed everything.
He told me he's not an architect.

1293
01:26:44,449 --> 01:26:47,243
You were right.
But right now. I'm actually running behind...

1294
01:26:47,411 --> 01:26:49,036
Mary, the man's a killer.

1295
01:26:50,080 --> 01:26:51,580
- What?
- Yes.

1296
01:26:51,748 --> 01:26:53,958
I have a friend
in the Boston Police Department.

1297
01:26:54,126 --> 01:26:58,087
He faxed me this this morning.
I'll just give you the highlights.

1298
01:26:58,922 --> 01:27:00,965
After a short stint as a petty thief...

1299
01:27:01,133 --> 01:27:06,595
...Patrick R. Healy graduated
to armed robbery by the age of 14.

1300
01:27:06,763 --> 01:27:09,765
At 16, he committed his first murder.

1301
01:27:09,933 --> 01:27:13,185
A pretty teacher's aide
named Molly Pettygrove.

1302
01:27:13,353 --> 01:27:17,857
He was incarcerated until the age of 22,
when, despite a grim psychological profile...

1303
01:27:18,024 --> 01:27:20,192
...the state was forced to release him.

1304
01:27:20,360 --> 01:27:22,778
In his mid-20s
and again in his early 30s...

1305
01:27:22,946 --> 01:27:26,699
...he was suspected of homicides
in the states of Utah and Washington.

1306
01:27:26,867 --> 01:27:30,744
Unfortunately.
the bodies were so badly decomposed...

1307
01:27:30,912 --> 01:27:35,166
...there wasn't enough evidence
to hold him. And so on and so forth.

1308
01:27:35,625 --> 01:27:38,919
What am I gonna do?
I'm supposed to meet this guy in an hour.

1309
01:27:39,087 --> 01:27:43,757
Well, just calm down.
Everything's going to be fine. Don't worry.

1310
01:27:43,925 --> 01:27:45,634
Tucker.

1311
01:27:46,511 --> 01:27:49,054
Why you two never hooked up
is beyond me.

1312
01:27:50,015 --> 01:27:52,141
I'm so lucky to have you as a friend.

1313
01:27:53,268 --> 01:27:56,896
Yes. Well. Don't get all gooey on me. Now.
You're gonna give me a big head.

1314
01:27:57,063 --> 01:27:58,981
See, the important thing, doctor...

1315
01:27:59,149 --> 01:28:01,817
...is you have to distance yourself
as much as possible...

1316
01:28:01,985 --> 01:28:03,694
...without pissing this psycho off.

1317
01:28:05,614 --> 01:28:07,323
Okay.

1318
01:28:07,782 --> 01:28:11,827
All right. I know what I've gotta do.
I know what I gotta do. Where's the phone?

1319
01:28:26,051 --> 01:28:28,177
You're gonna pay, fucker.

1320
01:28:46,154 --> 01:28:48,197
I don't know. Dom.

1321
01:28:48,740 --> 01:28:51,700
I don't feel good. I feel nervous.
I really feel nervous.

1322
01:28:51,868 --> 01:28:53,744
Oh, come on. Relax. Relax.

1323
01:28:53,912 --> 01:28:55,913
- You been to the cash machine?
- Yeah.

1324
01:28:56,081 --> 01:28:59,124
Car clean? Plenty of gas?

1325
01:28:59,918 --> 01:29:03,796
- Breath. How's your breath?
- It's fine. I had some Altoids.

1326
01:29:03,964 --> 01:29:08,634
All right. I think you're all set.
So just go clean the pipes and it's a go.

1327
01:29:09,761 --> 01:29:11,762
You know, clean the pipes.

1328
01:29:12,180 --> 01:29:14,390
What do you mean, clean the pipes?

1329
01:29:15,100 --> 01:29:18,936
You choke the chicken
before any big date. Don't you?

1330
01:29:19,354 --> 01:29:23,774
Tell me you spank the monkey
before any big date.

1331
01:29:24,609 --> 01:29:28,279
Oh, my God. He doesn't flog the dolphin
before a big date.

1332
01:29:28,446 --> 01:29:30,030
- No.
- Are you crazy?

1333
01:29:30,198 --> 01:29:32,491
That's like going out there
with a loaded gun.

1334
01:29:32,659 --> 01:29:35,286
Of course that's why you're nervous.

1335
01:29:35,453 --> 01:29:38,956
Oh, my dear friend. Please sit. Please.

1336
01:29:39,124 --> 01:29:45,629
Look. After you've had sex with a girl
and you're lying in bed with her...

1337
01:29:45,797 --> 01:29:47,172
...are you nervous?

1338
01:29:47,340 --> 01:29:50,801
- No.
- No, you're not. Why?

1339
01:29:50,969 --> 01:29:53,053
Because I'm tired.

1340
01:29:53,221 --> 01:29:57,099
Wrong. It's because you ain't got
the baby batter on the brain any more.

1341
01:29:57,267 --> 01:30:00,644
Jesus. That stuff will fuck your head up.

1342
01:30:01,354 --> 01:30:02,688
Look.

1343
01:30:02,856 --> 01:30:06,317
The most honest moment in a man's life
are the few minutes...

1344
01:30:06,484 --> 01:30:07,818
...after he's blown his load.

1345
01:30:07,986 --> 01:30:13,198
That is a medical fact. And the reason for it
is that you're no longer trying to get laid.

1346
01:30:13,366 --> 01:30:18,203
You're actually... You're thinking like a girl,
and girls love that.

1347
01:30:18,705 --> 01:30:20,748
Holy shit.

1348
01:30:20,915 --> 01:30:23,334
I've been going out with a loaded gun.

1349
01:30:24,711 --> 01:30:26,170
People get hurt that way.

1350
01:31:00,038 --> 01:31:02,581
Healy. How smashing to see you.

1351
01:31:02,749 --> 01:31:05,125
- You're dead, motherfucker.
- Okay. Take it easy.

1352
01:31:05,293 --> 01:31:08,671
Who the fuck do you think you are,
making that shit up about me?

1353
01:31:09,464 --> 01:31:11,882
It's that stalker. Ted.

1354
01:31:12,217 --> 01:31:13,676
He got ahold of you. Didn't he?

1355
01:31:13,843 --> 01:31:16,220
You're working for him. Aren't you,
you little shit?

1356
01:31:16,388 --> 01:31:17,721
Who?

1357
01:31:25,146 --> 01:31:28,023
Either you come clean,
or I'm gonna kick your fucking ass.

1358
01:31:28,191 --> 01:31:30,609
I love her. Man.

1359
01:31:31,486 --> 01:31:35,197
- What?
- You heard me. Goddamn it.

1360
01:31:37,701 --> 01:31:39,702
I love Mary. Man.

1361
01:31:42,288 --> 01:31:46,041
I'm a phony. Just like you.

1362
01:31:46,334 --> 01:31:51,255
- What do you mean?
- I mean I'm a fucking fraud.

1363
01:31:51,423 --> 01:31:54,550
I'm no architect. Don't be a putz, man.

1364
01:31:55,635 --> 01:31:59,763
Who's been to Santiago, Chile.
twice in one year?

1365
01:32:00,265 --> 01:32:05,018
- I've never even been to Jersey.
- Okay, okay. Just take it easy.

1366
01:32:05,186 --> 01:32:07,730
Wait a minute.
You knew those people back at Harvard.

1367
01:32:07,897 --> 01:32:10,023
Fuck. I knew shit, man.

1368
01:32:10,191 --> 01:32:13,360
The only thing I knew
was that you were a fake...

1369
01:32:13,570 --> 01:32:15,404
...and I made up everything else.

1370
01:32:16,531 --> 01:32:18,031
My real name's Norm.

1371
01:32:19,284 --> 01:32:21,285
I'm a pizza-delivery boy.

1372
01:32:21,453 --> 01:32:24,913
Here. Look. Here's my ID.

1373
01:32:33,256 --> 01:32:34,465
Fuck me.

1374
01:32:36,634 --> 01:32:39,261
Hey, boy. How about the pizza, huh?

1375
01:32:41,681 --> 01:32:43,515
Yeah? Well. Fuck you.

1376
01:32:44,893 --> 01:32:46,018
Calm down. Honey.

1377
01:32:46,186 --> 01:32:48,687
Hey, you want your pizza? Here. Man.

1378
01:32:54,194 --> 01:32:55,986
Excuse my friend.

1379
01:32:56,154 --> 01:32:58,363
He's had a little too much to drink.

1380
01:33:08,166 --> 01:33:10,584
Yeah. Yeah.

1381
01:33:18,426 --> 01:33:20,385
Keep the change.

1382
01:34:17,443 --> 01:34:20,904
Where the hell did it go?

1383
01:34:23,616 --> 01:34:26,410
Hang on. Wait a second.

1384
01:34:43,011 --> 01:34:46,013
- Hello. How you doing?
- Hey. Hi. Good. How are you?

1385
01:34:46,180 --> 01:34:47,514
- Good.
- Good.

1386
01:34:47,682 --> 01:34:50,517
You are looking very beautiful.

1387
01:34:50,685 --> 01:34:52,352
Thank you.

1388
01:34:53,146 --> 01:34:54,313
What is that?

1389
01:34:57,442 --> 01:34:58,650
On your ear.

1390
01:34:59,402 --> 01:35:02,529
- Ear?
- No, your left ear.

1391
01:35:02,989 --> 01:35:04,656
Is that...?

1392
01:35:06,701 --> 01:35:07,826
Is that hair gel?

1393
01:35:10,705 --> 01:35:12,831
- Yeah.
- Great. I could use some.

1394
01:35:12,999 --> 01:35:15,584
- No, no, no. You don't have to. You don't...
- No, really.

1395
01:35:15,752 --> 01:35:17,419
I just ran out.

1396
01:35:21,424 --> 01:35:23,216
- How we doing over here?
- Okay.

1397
01:35:23,384 --> 01:35:25,093
- Little more wine?
- Sure.

1398
01:35:26,387 --> 01:35:29,806
So when you say killer. You mean...

1399
01:35:29,974 --> 01:35:33,435
- He's a murderer. Yeah.
- Like, an actual convicted murderer?

1400
01:35:33,603 --> 01:35:36,021
He killed people. I know. It's crazy.

1401
01:35:36,189 --> 01:35:39,107
- And. What. Did he ever go to jail. Or he's...?
- Yeah, in Boston.

1402
01:35:39,275 --> 01:35:41,443
- He spent... I don't know how long.
- He got out?

1403
01:35:41,611 --> 01:35:43,403
Well, it's obvious. The system sucks.

1404
01:35:43,571 --> 01:35:45,947
The guy's walking the streets.
I'm kissing him.

1405
01:35:46,157 --> 01:35:50,035
Right, but you didn't
do anything else, right?

1406
01:35:50,203 --> 01:35:52,537
- What?
- I mean. You didn't...

1407
01:35:55,375 --> 01:35:57,125
- No, no, no.
- No, okay.

1408
01:35:57,293 --> 01:35:59,544
- God, I couldn't live with myself.
- No, I mean...

1409
01:35:59,712 --> 01:36:03,674
I only went out with him a couple times.
but, you know, just the thought of that...

1410
01:36:06,135 --> 01:36:09,012
I shouldn't be putting this all on you.
I'm sorry.

1411
01:36:09,180 --> 01:36:14,393
- We haven't seen each other in so long.
- No, it's just I feel really bad.

1412
01:36:14,560 --> 01:36:17,479
I'm tired of talking about stalkers.
Let's talk about you.

1413
01:36:19,565 --> 01:36:21,817
Are you okay? Yeah?

1414
01:36:21,984 --> 01:36:24,236
- Do you want some water?
- No, I'm good.

1415
01:36:24,612 --> 01:36:28,198
So then in '94, I went back to
Dade Community College for a semester.

1416
01:36:28,366 --> 01:36:33,328
And when the Wal-Mart cashier job fell
through, I hooked up with Peking Pizza.

1417
01:36:33,496 --> 01:36:37,374
Hey, Cat, how about
a couple of brews over here, man?

1418
01:36:38,501 --> 01:36:40,919
Hey, get the fuck out of here.

1419
01:36:41,087 --> 01:36:44,047
I told you 20 times
you're not welcome here anymore.

1420
01:36:44,215 --> 01:36:46,800
Hey, hey, hey. You.
where's that coming from?

1421
01:36:46,968 --> 01:36:50,178
It's coming from you always
skipping out on your tab.

1422
01:36:50,680 --> 01:36:52,389
Hey, I got cash.

1423
01:36:54,100 --> 01:36:56,017
Okay. Norm.

1424
01:36:56,310 --> 01:37:00,188
You pay. I'll pour. In that order.

1425
01:37:01,649 --> 01:37:04,276
- Hey, Tracy, how are the twins?
- Fuck you, Norm.

1426
01:37:04,444 --> 01:37:07,571
That's it,
I like it when you talk dirty to me. Man.

1427
01:37:08,573 --> 01:37:09,781
Here you go, big guy.

1428
01:37:10,658 --> 01:37:12,826
Come on. Cough it up. Chompers.

1429
01:37:16,372 --> 01:37:18,039
Thanks.

1430
01:37:20,001 --> 01:37:22,544
So how the hell did you meet Mary?

1431
01:37:23,546 --> 01:37:25,005
It was just dumb luck, really.

1432
01:37:25,173 --> 01:37:28,675
I delivered a pie to her and she
answered the door in her nightgown...

1433
01:37:28,843 --> 01:37:32,220
...and, wow. That was it for me.

1434
01:37:32,388 --> 01:37:35,223
I went home that night,
shaved my beard. And a week later...

1435
01:37:35,391 --> 01:37:38,059
...I'm laid out in her office
with a broken back.

1436
01:37:38,227 --> 01:37:40,937
Broken back? How'd you do that?

1437
01:37:41,105 --> 01:37:43,899
A friend. Baseball bat.

1438
01:37:44,317 --> 01:37:46,067
Touché.

1439
01:37:49,155 --> 01:37:50,947
You want another one?

1440
01:37:51,908 --> 01:37:55,035
Sure. Yeah. Hey, Docky.

1441
01:37:55,203 --> 01:37:58,580
- Couple more nitrate-sicles. Please.
- Two corn dogs coming up.

1442
01:37:58,748 --> 01:38:02,125
You know, I don't think that they have
enough meats on sticks.

1443
01:38:02,293 --> 01:38:05,295
No, seriously. If you think about it.
they have plenty of sweets.

1444
01:38:05,463 --> 01:38:08,924
They have lollipops.
they have Fudgsicles. They have Popsicles...

1445
01:38:09,091 --> 01:38:11,259
...but they don't have
any other meat on sticks.

1446
01:38:11,427 --> 01:38:14,471
- Yes, you don't see many meats on sticks.
- Absolutely not.

1447
01:38:14,639 --> 01:38:18,767
You know what I'd like to see?
I'd like to see more meats in a cone.

1448
01:38:18,935 --> 01:38:23,688
You don't hardly ever see that. You know.
that's an idea I think is waiting to pop.

1449
01:38:23,856 --> 01:38:27,442
Just like a nice. You know. Nice. Big,
oversize waffle-cone...

1450
01:38:27,610 --> 01:38:29,986
...stuffed full of chopped liver.
- Chopped liver.

1451
01:38:30,154 --> 01:38:31,321
Exactly.

1452
01:38:32,698 --> 01:38:34,574
- Too bad you don't live here, Ted.
- Yeah?

1453
01:38:34,742 --> 01:38:37,327
Yeah. We have a lot in common.

1454
01:38:39,455 --> 01:38:41,414
Well, you know, maybe...

1455
01:38:41,582 --> 01:38:45,293
Have you ever thought about
maybe moving back up to Rhode Island?

1456
01:38:45,461 --> 01:38:49,422
I thought about it, but I got too much
of a good thing going on here.

1457
01:38:49,590 --> 01:38:54,511
I got a great practice.
I like the people I work with. And Warren.

1458
01:38:55,012 --> 01:38:58,557
You know, maybe you should just. Like,
move down here and marry me.

1459
01:39:03,563 --> 01:39:07,566
- So you're a writer.
- Yeah, well, I'm trying to be.

1460
01:39:08,526 --> 01:39:11,611
Well, the good thing about writing
is you can do it anywhere.

1461
01:39:11,779 --> 01:39:13,321
That's true.

1462
01:39:15,324 --> 01:39:19,995
How about you? How did you manage
to stay single all these years?

1463
01:39:20,997 --> 01:39:27,502
Well, I'm bisexual. So that's hard
for a lot of guys to understand.

1464
01:39:29,005 --> 01:39:30,714
- Well...
- You gonna smoke that?

1465
01:39:33,885 --> 01:39:37,012
You know,
I read somewhere that most women...

1466
01:39:37,179 --> 01:39:40,932
...if you really ask them honestly,
have tendencies towards...

1467
01:39:41,100 --> 01:39:45,228
- I mean. Everybody has a bit of...
- Ted, I'm fucking with you.

1468
01:39:45,980 --> 01:39:47,564
Yeah.

1469
01:39:49,191 --> 01:39:51,902
Stalking motherfucker.

1470
01:39:52,069 --> 01:39:55,906
I know. It sickens me.

1471
01:39:56,073 --> 01:39:59,701
Actually. I did almost get married once.

1472
01:40:01,954 --> 01:40:03,663
What happened?

1473
01:40:04,540 --> 01:40:06,917
Well, he was a really great guy.

1474
01:40:07,209 --> 01:40:09,210
He lived up north, and...

1475
01:40:10,046 --> 01:40:11,838
Come on. Let's go.

1476
01:40:16,552 --> 01:40:18,178
Here you go.

1477
01:40:34,946 --> 01:40:38,031
Wait. How many is this?

1478
01:40:39,200 --> 01:40:41,076
- Four.
- Four?

1479
01:40:41,243 --> 01:40:44,496
That seems like an awful lot of speed
to give one little pooch.

1480
01:40:44,664 --> 01:40:48,416
- Are you sure it won't kill him?
- I never said that.

1481
01:40:51,337 --> 01:40:53,421
Baby.

1482
01:40:59,095 --> 01:41:00,762
Good. Good. Good.

1483
01:41:01,347 --> 01:41:06,768
And so then it was over.
We really haven't spoken since.

1484
01:41:07,186 --> 01:41:10,063
Wow. Sounds like he was almost perfect.

1485
01:41:11,524 --> 01:41:13,316
Almost.

1486
01:41:15,528 --> 01:41:18,279
Hey, you wanna go upstairs
and watch Sports Center?

1487
01:41:20,533 --> 01:41:23,535
You know, I think I'm just gonna quit
while I'm ahead.

1488
01:41:23,703 --> 01:41:26,037
You're not that far ahead, Ted.

1489
01:41:33,254 --> 01:41:35,171
Magda.

1490
01:41:35,965 --> 01:41:37,298
What are you doing?

1491
01:41:37,466 --> 01:41:39,968
Hi. Hon. Just straightening up.

1492
01:41:44,890 --> 01:41:46,099
Put that down.

1493
01:41:48,602 --> 01:41:50,395
Magda.

1494
01:41:50,980 --> 01:41:52,647
Thanks, doll.

1495
01:41:54,984 --> 01:41:57,152
Magda. Magda.

1496
01:41:57,319 --> 01:41:59,988
Honey, where is Puffy?

1497
01:42:00,156 --> 01:42:02,323
He was being a pest.
I put him in the bathroom.

1498
01:42:02,491 --> 01:42:03,992
Really?

1499
01:42:05,411 --> 01:42:07,037
Ted?

1500
01:42:07,747 --> 01:42:10,707
Can you do me a favor?
Would you mind letting the dog out?

1501
01:42:10,875 --> 01:42:13,418
I think I should have a talk
with Magda here.

1502
01:42:13,586 --> 01:42:15,253
Sure. Yeah.

1503
01:42:18,049 --> 01:42:19,257
- Over here.
- Where?

1504
01:42:19,425 --> 01:42:21,634
- Here. Fine.
- Good. What's going on?

1505
01:42:22,261 --> 01:42:23,887
More cleaning.

1506
01:42:24,180 --> 01:42:26,514
- How much coffee did you have tonight?
- None.

1507
01:42:29,727 --> 01:42:31,352
Mary?

1508
01:42:32,354 --> 01:42:34,564
What kind of dog is Puffy?

1509
01:42:34,732 --> 01:42:38,818
- Border terrier.
- Border terrier. Like Benji.

1510
01:42:48,287 --> 01:42:52,040
Hey.

1511
01:42:52,208 --> 01:42:55,835
Are you the little guy
making all that big noise?

1512
01:43:02,051 --> 01:43:03,093
Oh, Ted!

1513
01:43:13,646 --> 01:43:14,687
Puffy. Stop it!

1514
01:43:17,733 --> 01:43:19,400
Take a little bit of this.

1515
01:43:21,779 --> 01:43:23,613
Puffy. Puffy.

1516
01:43:30,454 --> 01:43:31,496
Puffy!

1517
01:43:47,388 --> 01:43:49,180
That's all you got. Pal?

1518
01:43:53,978 --> 01:43:59,607
Ted.

1519
01:44:05,573 --> 01:44:07,657
No, no, no.

1520
01:44:30,890 --> 01:44:32,432
Puffy!

1521
01:44:33,475 --> 01:44:36,769
Puffy! Puffy! Puffy!

1522
01:44:42,484 --> 01:44:44,611
How do you know that I'm right?

1523
01:44:44,778 --> 01:44:48,406
Well, you know. No, I don't.

1524
01:44:48,574 --> 01:44:51,284
- You want a grape?
- A grape? Sure.

1525
01:44:52,578 --> 01:44:54,412
- Ready?
- Yeah.

1526
01:44:55,039 --> 01:44:58,416
All net. All net. We make a good team.

1527
01:45:28,405 --> 01:45:29,989
Hey. Come on. Want a go?

1528
01:45:30,157 --> 01:45:32,075
- Closer?
- Don't be afraid. It's all right.

1529
01:45:32,242 --> 01:45:36,120
Get in closer. That's good. Don't be afraid.
Get right in there. A little bit more.

1530
01:45:36,288 --> 01:45:39,749
Good. He'll be fine.
Mary, you're being overprotective.

1531
01:46:12,992 --> 01:46:15,076
No, no, no. We already... We got...

1532
01:46:24,461 --> 01:46:26,212
Come on. Come on.

1533
01:46:30,509 --> 01:46:32,844
Warren. Warren.

1534
01:46:33,012 --> 01:46:35,471
- Warren.
- Warren.

1535
01:46:37,725 --> 01:46:39,684
Warren.

1536
01:46:42,187 --> 01:46:45,690
- Warren.
- Warren, come here. Stop.

1537
01:46:48,193 --> 01:46:50,528
I'm okay. I'm okay.

1538
01:46:50,696 --> 01:46:53,281
Hey. Hey.

1539
01:46:54,158 --> 01:46:57,535
- It's his fault. He hit me with that stuff.
- Here, let me help with that.

1540
01:46:57,703 --> 01:46:59,662
Warren! Warren!

1541
01:47:24,438 --> 01:47:27,899
I didn't do it. He got in the way.

1542
01:47:28,067 --> 01:47:30,693
I know. I know, I know.
Does anybody have any pliers?

1543
01:47:30,861 --> 01:47:34,530
Needle-nose. Otherwise? Anything?

1544
01:47:43,415 --> 01:47:44,999
Hey.

1545
01:47:45,667 --> 01:47:50,880
Flowers are for you. Ball is for Warren.
Had a friend FedEx it from Boston.

1546
01:47:51,048 --> 01:47:53,925
Signed by Tony Conigliaro.

1547
01:47:54,093 --> 01:47:57,762
Did you hire Pat Healy to spy on me?

1548
01:47:59,932 --> 01:48:01,432
What?

1549
01:48:02,684 --> 01:48:04,769
What are you talking about?

1550
01:48:05,354 --> 01:48:07,814
I got an anonymous letter.

1551
01:48:09,149 --> 01:48:10,775
It's not true. Right, Ted?

1552
01:48:15,114 --> 01:48:20,118
Well, it's an interesting thing
that happened. I...

1553
01:48:21,453 --> 01:48:23,621
Yeah. It's true, but it's not...

1554
01:48:23,789 --> 01:48:26,541
Okay. Get out.

1555
01:48:27,126 --> 01:48:30,044
Mary, wait.
First of all. I didn't know that this guy was...

1556
01:48:30,212 --> 01:48:31,963
What. That he was a murderer?

1557
01:48:32,131 --> 01:48:34,507
That. Yeah.
In addition to many other things.

1558
01:48:34,675 --> 01:48:37,635
I mean. I didn't know anything
about the guy. I hardly know him.

1559
01:48:37,803 --> 01:48:39,220
How could you do that, Ted?

1560
01:48:39,388 --> 01:48:43,975
How could you have some guy
you don't even know spy on me?

1561
01:48:44,476 --> 01:48:46,769
What were you trying to do?

1562
01:48:48,147 --> 01:48:51,315
Trick me into feeling something for you?

1563
01:48:54,236 --> 01:48:56,445
No. I didn't...

1564
01:48:56,655 --> 01:48:58,322
I didn't wanna trick you.

1565
01:49:00,159 --> 01:49:02,994
Just leave. Okay?

1566
01:49:04,413 --> 01:49:05,454
Mary.

1567
01:49:06,498 --> 01:49:08,082
Go.

1568
01:49:18,385 --> 01:49:22,054
I did it because I never stopped
thinking about you.

1569
01:49:22,890 --> 01:49:26,976
And if I didn't find you, I knew that my life
would never. Ever be good again.

1570
01:50:11,188 --> 01:50:12,563
Hey.

1571
01:50:12,773 --> 01:50:15,524
Healy. You in there?

1572
01:50:20,864 --> 01:50:22,406
Hello?

1573
01:50:37,923 --> 01:50:42,760
And it was going along just fine
until you showed up.

1574
01:50:44,846 --> 01:50:47,515
Holy shit.

1575
01:50:47,808 --> 01:50:50,726
This is a pretty nice place.

1576
01:50:51,478 --> 01:50:54,272
Sully. What the fuck happened?

1577
01:50:54,439 --> 01:50:57,733
- Hey, surprise.
- Hey, peace. Man. Come on.

1578
01:50:57,901 --> 01:50:59,819
- You fucked me, man.
- Wait. Come on.

1579
01:50:59,987 --> 01:51:04,323
- Man. Don't do anything rash now, buddy.
- Who the fuck is this guy?

1580
01:51:05,826 --> 01:51:09,620
That's Norm. He's a pizza boy.
He's in love with Mary too.

1581
01:51:10,289 --> 01:51:11,497
Look. Come on, man.

1582
01:51:11,915 --> 01:51:15,751
All right. Look. I think everybody
could use a drink right now.

1583
01:51:15,919 --> 01:51:17,253
I don't want a drink.

1584
01:51:17,713 --> 01:51:20,715
- Fuck you.
- Hey, hey. Hey. Look.

1585
01:51:21,216 --> 01:51:23,884
You asked me to follow around your girl
and I did.

1586
01:51:24,720 --> 01:51:29,056
And then the truth is. I started to like her.

1587
01:51:30,183 --> 01:51:33,853
And that's when I realized I couldn't
in good conscience bring myself to do it.

1588
01:51:35,314 --> 01:51:36,355
Do what?

1589
01:51:37,357 --> 01:51:39,900
Turn her over to a violent stalker.

1590
01:51:40,068 --> 01:51:43,112
Oh, I'm a stalker?
You're calling me a violent stalker?

1591
01:51:43,280 --> 01:51:46,240
- Oh. Yeah. Sure.
- I'm a...?

1592
01:51:48,744 --> 01:51:50,745
Oh, my God.

1593
01:51:53,081 --> 01:51:54,582
That poor dog.

1594
01:51:55,917 --> 01:51:57,376
- Hey, fuck you.
- Fuck you.

1595
01:51:57,544 --> 01:51:59,795
You just can't take the fact
that it was my turn.

1596
01:51:59,963 --> 01:52:02,965
- Your turn?
- Yeah, that's right. My turn.

1597
01:52:03,717 --> 01:52:06,427
Why can't I ever get a girl like Mary?

1598
01:52:07,012 --> 01:52:10,806
Just because you didn't get her. You didn't
have to blow us both out of the water.

1599
01:52:11,308 --> 01:52:12,767
What are you talking about?

1600
01:52:13,226 --> 01:52:16,145
You're gonna tell me
you didn't write her an anonymous letter...

1601
01:52:16,313 --> 01:52:18,481
...telling her about
our whole deal together?

1602
01:52:19,274 --> 01:52:20,316
What letter?

1603
01:52:21,818 --> 01:52:23,444
Come on.

1604
01:52:25,113 --> 01:52:26,113
It was you.

1605
01:52:29,493 --> 01:52:31,619
You sent the letter.

1606
01:52:31,870 --> 01:52:33,579
It was you.

1607
01:52:33,914 --> 01:52:37,792
We had a deal. You said you wouldn't
fuck me and I wouldn't fuck you...

1608
01:52:37,959 --> 01:52:41,462
...until we got this fuck
out of the fucking picture.

1609
01:52:41,630 --> 01:52:44,423
- You crossed the line, man.
- Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Man.

1610
01:52:44,591 --> 01:52:48,135
You're getting crazy now.
Why would I cross the line?

1611
01:52:49,137 --> 01:52:51,514
You probably did it yourself.
you piece of shit.

1612
01:52:51,681 --> 01:52:55,226
Oh, yeah. That makes a lot of sense.
Why would I rat myself out?

1613
01:52:55,394 --> 01:52:57,395
Like I'm gonna
try to figure out some guy...

1614
01:52:57,562 --> 01:53:01,065
...whose idea of courting
is blowing farts in her face.

1615
01:53:01,233 --> 01:53:06,779
- You were following us.
- Don't flatter yourself. I was following her.

1616
01:53:08,365 --> 01:53:10,491
I always do.

1617
01:53:10,909 --> 01:53:14,495
How the hell do you think
I got rid of the last guy. Brett?

1618
01:53:15,163 --> 01:53:20,584
Wait. Brett? Are you saying that Brett
didn't say those things about Warren?

1619
01:53:21,753 --> 01:53:25,673
Are you shitting me?
Mr. Goody-Two-Shoes?

1620
01:53:25,841 --> 01:53:28,342
He was like an Eagle Scout.

1621
01:53:28,552 --> 01:53:32,596
Wait a minute. You two should be kissing
my fucking hairy beanbag. You know?

1622
01:53:32,764 --> 01:53:35,891
Because if it wasn't for me,
she might have married that schmuck.

1623
01:53:38,353 --> 01:53:40,187
I feel sick.

1624
01:53:40,647 --> 01:53:42,648
Both of you are just...

1625
01:53:43,775 --> 01:53:45,568
I'm out of here.

1626
01:53:46,528 --> 01:53:48,237
Yeah.

1627
01:53:49,614 --> 01:53:53,868
You know, if it wasn't you who sent
the letter and I never sent it...

1628
01:53:54,286 --> 01:53:56,078
...who sent it?

1629
01:54:00,375 --> 01:54:01,959
Oh, hey. Hal.

1630
01:54:02,127 --> 01:54:05,796
I was worried about you. I thought that...

1631
01:54:07,883 --> 01:54:09,884
Oh, Sully.

1632
01:54:23,398 --> 01:54:24,982
Oh, my...

1633
01:54:25,609 --> 01:54:26,650
Woogie?

1634
01:54:27,444 --> 01:54:29,445
Who the hell is Woogie?

1635
01:54:32,532 --> 01:54:34,158
Hello.

1636
01:54:36,036 --> 01:54:37,536
What are you doing here?

1637
01:54:38,788 --> 01:54:42,041
Did you get my letter. Mare?
The one about Ted?

1638
01:54:44,127 --> 01:54:45,169
You sent that?

1639
01:54:48,423 --> 01:54:51,550
I was worried about you.

1640
01:54:51,718 --> 01:54:55,763
Woogie. You know you're not
supposed to be within 400 yards of me.

1641
01:54:55,931 --> 01:54:58,766
Yeah. I know. I do. In fact, you know...

1642
01:54:58,934 --> 01:55:01,602
...that's what I really wanted
to talk to you about.

1643
01:55:01,770 --> 01:55:07,900
You know that I have actually been through
nine years of intensive psychotherapy.

1644
01:55:08,068 --> 01:55:12,071
And you know something?
You were absolutely right. I needed help.

1645
01:55:12,822 --> 01:55:17,409
That's great. Woogie.
I mean. I'm glad you're doing better.

1646
01:55:17,577 --> 01:55:19,161
You look...

1647
01:55:19,913 --> 01:55:22,122
- You look good.
- Thank you.

1648
01:55:22,582 --> 01:55:25,543
Except for the rash thing's still there,
right?

1649
01:55:25,710 --> 01:55:30,297
Yes. You noticed, huh?
These are called love blisters.

1650
01:55:30,465 --> 01:55:35,886
They went away for a little while,
but then you came back in my life. Milady.

1651
01:55:37,305 --> 01:55:42,226
Woogie. I did not come back
into your life. Okay?

1652
01:55:42,394 --> 01:55:45,229
I don't even know how you found me.
Let's not forget. Here.

1653
01:55:45,397 --> 01:55:48,232
You put me through a lot of bullshit,
okay?

1654
01:55:48,400 --> 01:55:52,820
I had to change my name,
I had to go to court. I moved.

1655
01:55:52,988 --> 01:55:55,072
I mean. You stole all of my shoes.

1656
01:55:56,157 --> 01:55:58,993
What? What are you talking about?

1657
01:55:59,160 --> 01:56:01,412
Woogie. I caught you red-handed.

1658
01:56:02,747 --> 01:56:05,416
I was in a weird place then. Mary.

1659
01:56:06,084 --> 01:56:10,045
Come on. Okay? Come on.

1660
01:56:10,213 --> 01:56:14,300
Give me a break here, okay?
I was a little nuts. A little...

1661
01:56:14,467 --> 01:56:16,552
But I'm fine.

1662
01:56:16,720 --> 01:56:20,681
Woogie. You're starting
to make me a little nervous.

1663
01:56:21,850 --> 01:56:24,351
I'm making you feel nervous?
Nervous? What's that?

1664
01:56:24,519 --> 01:56:27,605
I wouldn't know anything about nervous.
Jeez.

1665
01:56:27,772 --> 01:56:31,233
You ever had a whitehead
on your eyeball, Mary?

1666
01:56:31,401 --> 01:56:34,194
Woogie. I'm asking you to leave.

1667
01:56:34,362 --> 01:56:38,616
Oh, Mary.
Oh, Mary, you got this all wrong.

1668
01:56:38,783 --> 01:56:40,743
I'm not going anywhere.

1669
01:56:42,203 --> 01:56:45,039
Not until I get something
to remember you by.

1670
01:56:47,208 --> 01:56:49,585
Get your hands out of there.

1671
01:56:50,420 --> 01:56:52,212
- No. Woogie.
- Yeah.

1672
01:56:52,380 --> 01:56:53,672
Let go.

1673
01:56:54,424 --> 01:56:56,008
Stop it. Stop!

1674
01:56:56,176 --> 01:57:00,512
Just one pair. You owe me that.
you heartless bitch.

1675
01:57:01,139 --> 01:57:04,183
What the...? Hey.

1676
01:57:09,147 --> 01:57:12,524
Dom? You're pathetic.

1677
01:57:12,984 --> 01:57:16,862
Tucker. What happened to your crutches?

1678
01:57:17,447 --> 01:57:19,239
Yeah. Well...

1679
01:57:19,407 --> 01:57:21,700
Yes. Very good query, Mary. Well done.

1680
01:57:21,868 --> 01:57:24,328
Come on. Tell her the truth. Pizza boy.

1681
01:57:28,291 --> 01:57:30,250
Name's Norm.

1682
01:57:30,418 --> 01:57:34,129
I live with my folks up in Pompano. Hey.

1683
01:57:35,757 --> 01:57:39,635
Oh, man.
This is like group therapy or something.

1684
01:57:39,803 --> 01:57:41,595
Dom. What are you doing here?

1685
01:57:42,138 --> 01:57:45,849
You stole her from me.
and now I want her back.

1686
01:57:46,017 --> 01:57:48,560
I stole her from you?
What are you talking about?

1687
01:57:49,646 --> 01:57:52,731
Woogie. How many times
did I tell you this at Princeton?

1688
01:57:53,316 --> 01:57:56,402
- Woogie?
- Ted and I had one date.

1689
01:57:56,569 --> 01:57:59,154
- You and I were already broken up.
- You're Woogie?

1690
01:58:00,115 --> 01:58:02,324
Dom Woganowski.

1691
01:58:03,993 --> 01:58:08,497
But you're married.
You have a wife, beautiful kids.

1692
01:58:08,665 --> 01:58:11,458
Ted, if you love them so much.
please, be my guest.

1693
01:58:11,626 --> 01:58:16,630
All right. What the hell is going on here?
Can someone explain it to me?

1694
01:58:17,090 --> 01:58:20,759
Look. We're all in love with Mary.

1695
01:58:21,928 --> 01:58:23,303
Oh, God.

1696
01:58:23,930 --> 01:58:27,182
If I may, I have a proposal.

1697
01:58:27,684 --> 01:58:30,644
I say none of us leaves this room...

1698
01:58:30,812 --> 01:58:34,022
...until our young Mary here
stops jerking us around...

1699
01:58:34,190 --> 01:58:38,110
...and decides. Once and for all,
who she really wants.

1700
01:58:40,363 --> 01:58:43,240
Now. Mary. I know this is tough...

1701
01:58:43,908 --> 01:58:49,037
...but you really will be doing them all
a great favor to tell them the truth about us.

1702
01:58:49,205 --> 01:58:52,583
Are you crazy? What makes you think
I would pick you anyhow?

1703
01:58:52,751 --> 01:58:54,918
I mean. You're a murderer.

1704
01:58:57,380 --> 01:59:02,843
Well, I may have been blowing
a little smoke up your ass there, Mary.

1705
01:59:03,011 --> 01:59:04,595
I'm sorry.

1706
01:59:07,557 --> 01:59:10,809
- Touchdown.
- Hi, Mary.

1707
01:59:11,561 --> 01:59:14,855
- Brett?
- What the hell is Brett Favre doing here?

1708
01:59:15,023 --> 01:59:17,232
I'm in town to play the Dolphins,
you dumb-ass.

1709
01:59:17,400 --> 01:59:21,236
Yeah. I called him. Mary. I told him
to pick up Warren and get down here.

1710
01:59:21,404 --> 01:59:25,532
See, your friend Tucker
was lying about a couple of other things.

1711
01:59:25,700 --> 01:59:27,868
Brett never said
those bad things about Warren.

1712
01:59:28,036 --> 01:59:29,745
He loves Warren.

1713
01:59:29,913 --> 01:59:34,374
And from what he told me on the phone
just now. He loves you too.

1714
01:59:34,542 --> 01:59:36,794
He's the guy you should be with.

1715
01:59:40,924 --> 01:59:44,635
That's right. Mary.
You know I'll always be true to you.

1716
01:59:44,969 --> 01:59:48,096
Shit. This isn't fair. Jesus.

1717
01:59:48,264 --> 01:59:50,390
You know, I feel like an idiot.

1718
01:59:50,934 --> 01:59:56,063
See, I realized something today.
I'm no better than any of these guys.

1719
01:59:56,564 --> 01:59:59,942
I mean. None of them love you. Really.

1720
02:00:01,069 --> 02:00:05,447
They're just fixated on you because of how
you make them feel about themselves.

1721
02:00:05,615 --> 02:00:08,575
I mean. That's not real love. That's...

1722
02:00:09,577 --> 02:00:10,869
I don't know what that is.

1723
02:00:12,330 --> 02:00:15,457
Please. Mary. Don't listen to him.

1724
02:00:15,625 --> 02:00:18,293
This is just another one of his
stupid little ploys.

1725
02:00:18,461 --> 02:00:20,796
You know, Stroehmann,
you are so full of shit.

1726
02:00:20,964 --> 02:00:24,842
- Yeah. You're the biggest stalker of us all.
- You're gonna stand here and tell me...

1727
02:00:25,009 --> 02:00:27,427
...that you're not nuts about this girl?

1728
02:00:27,971 --> 02:00:29,888
Yeah. That's what I'm telling you.

1729
02:00:33,810 --> 02:00:36,645
- Hey, good luck, Brett.
- Yeah. Thank you.

1730
02:00:36,813 --> 02:00:39,731
She's a great gal. Take care of her.

1731
02:00:41,317 --> 02:00:42,943
I'll see you, Mary.

1732
02:00:43,862 --> 02:00:45,279
Bye. Ted.

1733
02:00:48,199 --> 02:00:52,202
- Hey, Warren, see you later.
- Okay, goodbye. Ted.

1734
02:00:54,038 --> 02:00:55,622
Goodbye.

1735
02:00:57,000 --> 02:00:59,209
God, Mary, I've missed you.

1736
02:00:59,544 --> 02:01:00,586
Hey, Brett.

1737
02:01:00,753 --> 02:01:03,922
What are the chances I could get you
to give me a little autograph?

1738
02:01:04,090 --> 02:01:06,091
- Something nice to the wife and kids.
- What?

1739
02:01:06,259 --> 02:01:08,510
Oh, shut up. Cock tease.

1740
02:01:35,079 --> 02:01:39,499
Well, she's back with her old boyfriend

1741
02:01:39,667 --> 02:01:43,962
He don't challenge her
He don't contend with her

1742
02:01:44,130 --> 02:01:48,425
And she don't answer the cards you send

1743
02:01:48,593 --> 02:01:52,554
And you're jealous of the time
That he spend with her

1744
02:01:52,722 --> 02:01:56,934
Just let her go into the darkness

1745
02:01:57,560 --> 02:02:01,897
Let her live for all the things there

1746
02:02:02,065 --> 02:02:06,234
Let her go into the darkness

1747
02:02:06,402 --> 02:02:10,447
Let her go, let her go. Let her go

1748
02:02:34,222 --> 02:02:35,764
Ted.

1749
02:02:37,600 --> 02:02:39,226
Mary?

1750
02:02:41,145 --> 02:02:42,938
Ted.

1751
02:02:43,940 --> 02:02:45,607
Mary.

1752
02:02:47,777 --> 02:02:49,361
Ted.

1753
02:02:53,324 --> 02:02:54,825
You forgot your keys.

1754
02:03:08,673 --> 02:03:10,757
Did you really mean
what you said up there?

1755
02:03:14,470 --> 02:03:16,722
I just want you to be happy. Mary.

1756
02:03:20,810 --> 02:03:22,936
But I'd be happiest with you.

1757
02:03:27,483 --> 02:03:29,026
You're fucking with me, right?

1758
02:03:33,614 --> 02:03:38,285
What about Brett Favre?

1759
02:03:40,246 --> 02:03:42,998
What did I tell you the first time we met?

1760
02:03:43,499 --> 02:03:45,125
I'm a Niners fan.

1761
02:03:58,056 --> 02:04:03,435
His friends would say
"Stop whining." they've had enough of that

1762
02:04:03,603 --> 02:04:08,774
His friends would say
"Stop pining, there's other girls to look at"

1763
02:04:09,233 --> 02:04:14,029
They've tried to set him up
With Tiffany and Indigo

1764
02:04:14,614 --> 02:04:19,951
But there's something about Mary
That they don't know

1765
02:04:20,119 --> 02:04:21,244
What are you doing?

1766
02:04:21,412 --> 02:04:24,956
- That's my girl he's kissing.
- But you just slept with me.

1767
02:04:25,124 --> 02:04:27,584
I was only boning you to get to Mary.

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,001


2
00:00:00,002 --> 00:00:00,003


3
00:00:40,422 --> 00:00:43,109
Well, well, Boris the Animal has a visitor.

4
00:00:43,116 --> 00:00:45,715
I guess one every 40 years is okay.

5
00:00:48,855 --> 00:00:51,990
- It's a cake.
- I decide what it is.

6
00:00:55,029 --> 00:00:56,922
Looks like some kinda cake.

7
00:00:58,024 --> 00:01:02,189
She's clean. Well, not
"clean", but you know...

8
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:40,948
Oh, God!

9
00:01:49,158 --> 00:01:56,690
- Boris the Animal, you've got a visitor.
- It's just Boris.

10
00:02:02,696 --> 00:02:06,577
Your letters have been
a soul nourishing tonic.

11
00:02:08,045 --> 00:02:11,198
And you are much more...

12
00:02:11,384 --> 00:02:15,813
unconventionally handsome
than your photos.

13
00:02:25,983 --> 00:02:29,711
This ain't a conjugal visit!
So, quit yur conjugatin'!

14
00:02:30,289 --> 00:02:33,253
When was the last time
you conjugated anything?

15
00:02:34,297 --> 00:02:36,688
I see you brought me a treat, Darling.

16
00:02:36,689 --> 00:02:40,040
Would you mind cutting this up for us,
it's a special day.

17
00:02:40,055 --> 00:02:42,283
I'm a Romantic, like that.

18
00:02:47,481 --> 00:02:50,194
- Oh, I wouldn't do that.
- Why's that?

19
00:02:50,195 --> 00:02:52,379
It'll ruin your figure.

20
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:38,896
You complete me.

21
00:03:58,067 --> 00:03:59,439
The Big One.

22
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:08,017
Boris, you promised to take
me with you! We had a deal!

23
00:04:09,934 --> 00:04:16,505
Obadiah Price. Yes.
I did make you a promise.

24
00:04:25,351 --> 00:04:28,316
Wait!
I smell something.

25
00:04:34,136 --> 00:04:37,969
- You can't win, Boris!
- Let's agree to disagree.

26
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:40,578
- There's too many of us.
- It's rather hot in here.

27
00:04:40,579 --> 00:04:42,741
Mind if I open a window?

28
00:05:01,366 --> 00:05:05,331
Sorry, Darling...
we did love the cake.

29
00:05:27,466 --> 00:05:31,197
Let's rewrite history, shall we, K?

30
00:05:43,483 --> 00:05:45,428
Men in Black Three

31
00:05:51,695 --> 00:05:55,798
Good afternoon. Please give your
attention to my associate, Agent J.

32
00:05:55,799 --> 00:05:58,947
He's going to demonstrate
an electro-bio-mechanical-neural-

33
00:05:58,948 --> 00:06:02,911
transmitting-zero-synapse-repositioner.
We call it The Neuralizor.

34
00:06:02,912 --> 00:06:05,284
- Keep it simple, Slick.
- Thanks a lot.

35
00:06:05,285 --> 00:06:08,680
Thank you, Agent K. Ladies and gentlemen,
if you will, look right here.

36
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:15,671
Okay! You know how you're on a airplane and the
flight attendant asks you to turn your cell phone off?

37
00:06:15,672 --> 00:06:18,995
And you, "Like, I ain't turnin' my cell phone off
that don't have nothin' to do with no damn airplane!"

38
00:06:19,088 --> 00:06:21,728
Well, there's what we did!
That's what happens.

39
00:06:21,729 --> 00:06:24,895
It gets up there, bounces around
on the satellites, and BLAM!

40
00:06:25,078 --> 00:06:27,920
Just turn your damn cell phone off!
Now you gonna drive off a cliff

41
00:06:27,921 --> 00:06:30,068
tonight because your GPS don't work.

42
00:06:31,515 --> 00:06:34,123
Check the composition of the fuel units
and run a scan on the surface deposits.

43
00:06:34,124 --> 00:06:36,631
- I wanna know who was drivin' that thing.
- Yes, Sir.

44
00:06:37,473 --> 00:06:39,861
- So, what are you gonna say tonight?
- Ah, don't worry.

45
00:06:39,862 --> 00:06:43,244
- No, I'm very worried, this is important.
- I'm hungry, are you hungry?

46
00:06:43,325 --> 00:06:43,953
K!

47
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:49,326
Seriously, I'm not even sure that's meat!
I think I just saw a tooth in that thing.

48
00:06:49,327 --> 00:06:52,602
- Or a claw, or a hoof.
- Thanks, Lenny.

49
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:55,300
That does not belong in a pita,
it belongs in a casket!

50
00:06:55,301 --> 00:06:57,462
You know what would go really
good with this would be some Sygonks.

51
00:06:57,463 --> 00:06:59,108
All right, see, here's the problem...

52
00:06:59,109 --> 00:07:03,718
You can't smell it because your nose
already smells like that but my nose doesn't.

53
00:07:03,819 --> 00:07:05,396
Sygonks go good with a lot of things,

54
00:07:05,397 --> 00:07:07,747
You ever try it or is
talking the way you breathe?

55
00:07:07,928 --> 00:07:10,648
If you hate me, you should just say you
hate me, don't take it out on the car.

56
00:07:10,649 --> 00:07:13,933
- Let me enjoy this.
- Whoa! Enjoyment!

57
00:07:14,373 --> 00:07:17,675
So that's what enjoyment looks like
on that face. I like that emotion.

58
00:07:18,719 --> 00:07:21,154
- I keep emotions out of it.
- Out of what, K...

59
00:07:21,155 --> 00:07:22,136
life?

60
00:07:25,139 --> 00:07:27,956
Sure you don't want to run it by me?
Let me know what you're gonna say tonight?

61
00:07:27,957 --> 00:07:31,141
- Don't worry.
- Oh, no! I'm worried! Very worried.

62
00:07:31,142 --> 00:07:33,712
It's the man's eulogy, you're gonna
have to show some feeling.

63
00:07:33,913 --> 00:07:37,646
You know, that thing that human people do
when they change the expression on their face?

64
00:07:38,275 --> 00:07:43,519
I worked with Zed for 40 years, he was a helluva an
agent, and I have written a helluva speech for him.

65
00:07:43,892 --> 00:07:45,743
People will be moved.

66
00:08:06,117 --> 00:08:08,689
And now, a few words from Agent K.

67
00:08:09,002 --> 00:08:13,735
I worked with Zed for over 40 years and in all
the that time he never invited me to dinner,

68
00:08:13,853 --> 00:08:16,821
he never asked me to his
house to watch a game,

69
00:08:18,237 --> 00:08:21,731
he never shared a single
detail of his personal life.

70
00:08:22,665 --> 00:08:24,103
Real hard work.

71
00:08:29,219 --> 00:08:30,467
Thank you.

72
00:08:32,485 --> 00:08:35,935
And now we will hear from
our new chief, Agent O.

73
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:38,563
Thank you, Agent K.,
that was very moving.

74
00:08:38,798 --> 00:08:41,202
- That was your eulogy?
- Yeah, he was a good man.

75
00:08:41,761 --> 00:08:44,849
Ladies, gentlemen, other life forms...

76
00:08:45,257 --> 00:08:49,020
when I told the Fenution Zyglot
about Zed's passing,

77
00:08:49,021 --> 00:08:51,640
she said something that
I'm going to repeat,

78
00:08:52,056 --> 00:08:53,663
and I'm paraphrasing,

87
00:09:17,393 --> 00:09:21,261
That's just so Zed.
Thank you.

88
00:09:33,644 --> 00:09:37,448
- You lose somethin' over there, Hondo?
- Can you promise me if I go first

89
00:09:37,483 --> 00:09:39,043
you'll do  better than that at my funeral?

90
00:09:39,166 --> 00:09:43,273
Yeah, something like: J was a friend.

91
00:09:43,457 --> 00:09:46,363
and now there’s a big
part of me that's gone.

92
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:50,182
Oh! J! All the things I shoulda said,

93
00:09:50,183 --> 00:09:56,075
'cept I was too old and craggy,
surly, and just tight...

94
00:09:56,076 --> 00:09:58,255
'cause I was too tight.

95
00:09:58,256 --> 00:10:02,650
Now I'm gonna just miss
your caramel brown skin.

96
00:10:02,651 --> 00:10:04,435
I'll wing somethin'.

97
00:10:06,707 --> 00:10:13,326
<i> K, it's O, we have reports of several humans
suffering from intestinal worms... of alien origin.</i>

98
00:10:13,546 --> 00:10:14,772
Thank you, O.

99
00:10:16,257 --> 00:10:20,207
Vick, how'd you get to be like you?
Seriously, somethin' happened, K, what happened?

100
00:10:20,508 --> 00:10:22,486
You know how I live such a happy life.

101
00:10:22,865 --> 00:10:25,367
How you live such a happy life?

102
00:10:25,668 --> 00:10:28,673
I don't ask questions I don't
wanna know the answer to.

103
00:10:29,831 --> 00:10:30,858
That's deep.

104
00:10:46,446 --> 00:10:49,267
- What, do I know you?
- Your services are legendary.

105
00:10:49,268 --> 00:10:53,748
- So says your father, Obadiah.
- You were in LunarMax?

106
00:10:53,749 --> 00:10:57,617
There is no prison that can hold me!

107
00:10:58,985 --> 00:11:01,185
Cool for you,
whatdaya need from me, Man?

108
00:11:01,586 --> 00:11:07,160
The Device. I'm going back in time
to kill a man before he takes my arm.

109
00:11:23,438 --> 00:11:29,166
Woh, K,  J! So happy to see you!
Mr. Wu get you your legulal table!

110
00:11:36,496 --> 00:11:38,983
- You no hungry?
- Show us the tanks, Wu.

111
00:11:38,984 --> 00:11:42,475
Oh, sure, sure!
You look! Vely flesh!

112
00:11:42,476 --> 00:11:43,858
Show us the tanks in the back.

113
00:11:44,564 --> 00:11:47,464
So sorry, no speaky English.
You come back later, okay?

114
00:11:47,512 --> 00:11:50,017
Save the Chop Saki bullshit
for tourists, Wu.

115
00:11:52,958 --> 00:11:57,473
- Hey, whatdaya guys wanna bust my balls for, huh?
- You don't have no balls, Wu.

116
00:11:59,922 --> 00:12:04,478
Ooo,  man, you look like you
come from The Planet Damn.

117
00:12:05,136 --> 00:12:08,658
And Bob here is a clear violation
of Health Ordinance 32,

118
00:12:08,985 --> 00:12:16,114
selling unlicensed,
extraterrestrial... food stuffs.

119
00:12:16,115 --> 00:12:19,361
That is an Earth fish.
Very traditional in China.

120
00:12:19,362 --> 00:12:21,498
You arrest me, that's a hate crime.

121
00:12:21,499 --> 00:12:23,681
It would be if you were Chinese!

122
00:12:25,039 --> 00:12:27,695
K, c'mon, I got larvae to feed!

123
00:12:28,644 --> 00:12:31,388
- Who is this Spikey Bulba for Wu?
- Nobody.

124
00:12:31,481 --> 00:12:33,745
- Who's it for?
- I keep 'em just in case!

125
00:12:33,746 --> 00:12:36,409
- You can't talk?
- I don't know... anybody!

126
00:12:41,985 --> 00:12:44,217
He and I are having issues
in our relationship right now,

127
00:12:44,218 --> 00:12:45,627
but you shouldn't have to suffer for that.

128
00:12:45,628 --> 00:12:46,400
Thanks, J.

129
00:12:46,401 --> 00:12:49,660
So if you don't like gettin' fish-slapped,
I'm gonna need you to keep to our agreements,

130
00:12:49,661 --> 00:12:52,613
Earth people get Earth fish,
real Earth fish.

131
00:12:52,614 --> 00:12:56,106
On behalf of my pathetic self and
worthless children, you stay!

132
00:12:56,141 --> 00:12:59,913
Allow me most honorable benefit
of serving you favorite noodles cake?

133
00:12:59,914 --> 00:13:02,128
Don't know if I want
none o' your nasty-ass-noodles, Wu.

134
00:13:02,129 --> 00:13:03,768
You're a piece of shit, Wu.

135
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:07,105
Just wrap it and box it away,
we're gonna be here a while.

136
00:13:22,833 --> 00:13:24,424
There was just mean,

137
00:13:24,725 --> 00:13:26,389
what you did to Wu back there.

138
00:13:28,287 --> 00:13:32,225
Snatched his skirt off,
that's just disrespectful.

139
00:13:32,385 --> 00:13:36,172
I used to play a game with my dad:
What'll-You-Have-For-Your-Last-Meal.

140
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:39,464
You could do worse than this.

141
00:13:40,758 --> 00:13:43,556
Oh! Okay! Uh...

142
00:13:44,457 --> 00:13:46,721
I used to play a game
with my dad called "Catch".

143
00:13:47,343 --> 00:13:51,543
'cept I would throw the ball and it
would just hit the wall 'cause he wasn't there.

144
00:13:51,544 --> 00:13:53,852
Don't bad-mouth your old man.

145
00:13:54,529 --> 00:13:57,745
I'm not bad-mouthin' 'im,
I just... I didn't really know 'im.

146
00:13:58,058 --> 00:13:58,812
It's not right.

147
00:13:58,813 --> 00:14:01,460
You're damn right it's not right!
A little boy needs a father.

148
00:14:01,495 --> 00:14:03,051
Table one hasn't ordered a thing.

149
00:14:03,052 --> 00:14:07,556
And table three over there just
drank his fourth cup of duck sauce.

150
00:14:11,309 --> 00:14:14,113
<i>K, the crashed ship from this
morning was stolen from...</i>

151
00:14:14,114 --> 00:14:17,239
-  LunarMax Prison, Boris the Animal.
- How did you know...

152
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:21,021
He always had a taste for Spikey Bulba.
Give us a minute, will ya, Chief.

153
00:14:22,944 --> 00:14:25,926
We're in a situation.

154
00:14:25,927 --> 00:14:26,834
<i>Yeah.</i>

155
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:31,649
I'll take the Cloropod, you take the
Turanavi and the Hidronianul over there.

156
00:14:31,992 --> 00:14:34,486
I'll take whatever's in the kitchen
and meet you on the street.

157
00:14:35,181 --> 00:14:37,735
This is a very confusing time in my life.

158
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:12,377
Keep your mouth closed!
Keep your head down!

159
00:16:39,229 --> 00:16:40,842
Hello, K.

160
00:16:43,794 --> 00:16:47,864
- Boris the Animal.
- It's just Boris.

161
00:16:47,865 --> 00:16:52,525
You haven't changed very much.
I see the arm I shot off is still shot off.

162
00:16:52,526 --> 00:16:54,356
Yes, my arm.

163
00:16:56,657 --> 00:17:01,905
We thought about that moment
every day for the last 40 years.

164
00:17:01,906 --> 00:17:03,900
Well, that's just not living a full life.

165
00:17:03,901 --> 00:17:08,095
- I can promise you it will be longer than yours.
- Lonelier, too.

166
00:17:08,157 --> 00:17:12,763
- Since you're the last Bogladyte standing.
- We'll see about that,

167
00:17:12,764 --> 00:17:16,318
but first. I wanted the
pleasure of killing you.

168
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:17,394
Yo, K!

169
00:17:19,549 --> 00:17:21,763
- Where the hell you been?
- Fishing!

170
00:17:39,653 --> 00:17:43,146
You don't know it, K,
but you're already dead.

171
00:17:49,001 --> 00:17:50,135
Ya all right?

172
00:18:01,451 --> 00:18:03,544
Could I have everyone’s attention, please!

173
00:18:08,019 --> 00:18:11,160
Thank you. Okay. You know how
your kid won the goldfish

174
00:18:11,161 --> 00:18:13,940
in that little baggy from the school fair
and you didn't want that nasty thing

175
00:18:13,941 --> 00:18:15,935
in your house, so you told your kid it ran away,

176
00:18:15,936 --> 00:18:17,981
but what your really did
was flush it down the toilet?

177
00:18:18,226 --> 00:18:19,925
Well, this what happens.

178
00:18:20,147 --> 00:18:22,577
Okay? See what I'm talkin' 'bout?
Don't lie to your kids!

179
00:18:28,783 --> 00:18:34,481
Well, I'm gettin' too old for this.
I can only imagine how you feel.

180
00:18:34,934 --> 00:18:40,315
Boris the Animal... put him away a long time ago.
It's the worst mistake I ever made.

181
00:18:40,704 --> 00:18:44,117
- Why? Was he innocent?
- Shoulda killed 'im.

182
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:49,078
- Well, shoots, let's go get him.
- No!

183
00:18:49,458 --> 00:18:52,307
- No?
- Leave it alone, it's above your pay grade.

184
00:18:52,875 --> 00:18:55,996
- We're partners, we have the same pay grade.
- It has nothing to do with you!

185
00:18:55,997 --> 00:18:57,883
Mind your own business!

186
00:18:58,384 --> 00:19:02,169
Okay, first of all, let's get a
little bit dat bass outchyour voice and secondly,

187
00:19:02,170 --> 00:19:05,496
as long as SpikeyBoy is runnin'
around town, this is my whole business.

188
00:19:05,497 --> 00:19:10,132
You will forget about Boris. or my report will
reflect that your conduct has been unbecoming.

189
00:19:10,458 --> 00:19:13,345
Well, maybe my report is gonna
reflect some shit, too, okay?

190
00:19:13,546 --> 00:19:16,365
- You are suspended for two weeks.
- Bullshit!

191
00:19:16,366 --> 00:19:18,255
Four... weeks.

192
00:19:19,002 --> 00:19:20,201
How about I quit?

193
00:19:20,702 --> 00:19:22,999
There are things out there
 you do not need to know.

194
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:25,883
That's not lie you told me
when you recruited me!

195
00:19:36,498 --> 00:19:39,429

Why this sudden interest in
your partner's old exploits, hmm?

220
00:21:18,843 --> 00:21:20,794
What happened between Boris and K?

221
00:21:20,795 --> 00:21:26,426
That's easy. K imprisoned Boris, he put up the
ArcNet, he protected the Earth from the Bogladytes...

222
00:21:26,490 --> 00:21:28,670
he did his job.

Ya know that's not what I'm askin' ya.

00:21:31,448 --> 00:21:33,601

Something that changed him.

Leave it with that.

227
00:21:40,201 --> 00:21:42,817
So you two go way back, huh?

228
00:21:47,609 --> 00:21:49,475
That's classified.

229
00:21:50,384 --> 00:21:56,045
A word of advice, Agent J, don't ask questions
you don't want to know the answer to.

230
00:21:58,302 --> 00:22:01,653
That's funny, that is exactly what K said.

231
00:22:05,634 --> 00:22:07,393
He's a very wise man.

232
00:22:08,238 --> 00:22:10,028
Take the rest of the night off.

233
00:22:27,239 --> 00:22:30,436
- What?
- Guess I owe you some answers, Hoss.

234
00:22:30,437 --> 00:22:34,149
I don't want you feelin' chatty all of a sudden!
Sorry, I can't talk right now,

235
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:36,663
I got some secret cases
of my own I'm workin' on.

236
00:22:36,664 --> 00:22:38,967
I hate to tear you away
from your video game.

237
00:22:39,671 --> 00:22:41,136
All right, I'm hangin' up.

238

<i>You know the most destructive

<i>Regret.</i>

241
00:22:51,651 --> 00:22:53,439
You don't have to wait... just talk.

242
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,287
I promised you of the secrets
of the universe, nothing more.

243
00:22:56,552 --> 00:22:59,735
So what, are some secrets out there
that the universe don't know about?

244
00:24:36,907 --> 00:24:38,420
Can I help you?

245
00:24:41,992 --> 00:24:43,194
K?

246
00:24:43,839 --> 00:24:45,200
5K.

247
00:24:49,673 --> 00:24:52,479
I'm sorry, is that chocolate milk? Can I...

248
00:24:52,622 --> 00:24:54,617
I'm so sorry, I don't know what...

249
00:24:56,382 --> 00:25:00,332
Mommy, look what!
The President's drinking my milk.

250
00:25:02,094 --> 00:25:03,517
I'm sorry.

251
00:25:06,433 --> 00:25:08,690
He didn't say, "Please."

252
00:25:22,499 --> 00:25:24,509
- K get in yet?
- Who?

253
00:25:25,194 --> 00:25:28,674
- Are you new?
- Very funny, Agent J.

254
00:25:37,166 --> 00:25:39,907
J, everything you told me
yesterday, you were right as rain.

255
00:25:39,908 --> 00:25:41,749
Thank God for that 10 hours stake-out.

256
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:42,656
And who are you?

257
00:25:42,657 --> 00:25:47,411
Exactly. I feel like a whole new man today.
Like this great weight has been lifted.

258
00:25:47,412 --> 00:25:51,343
I mean, I've had these anger issues my entire life,
but now I can see I was just mad at myself.

259
00:25:51,344 --> 00:25:54,237
- And my step-mom.
- Sir, I'm gonna need you to stop talking.

260
00:25:54,238 --> 00:25:56,643
It's like I close this emotional window.

261
00:25:56,644 --> 00:25:58,874
But yesterday I threw a brick
right through that window

262
00:25:58,875 --> 00:26:01,144
and I just want to thank you
for handing me that brick, J.

263
00:26:01,145 --> 00:26:05,165
Okay, whoever you are, I need you to give me
five feet, or I'm gonna pluck you in your throat.

264
00:26:06,736 --> 00:26:08,704
Okay, I'm gonna go to the
Little-Mens-In-Blacks-Room.

265
00:26:08,705 --> 00:26:11,805
and then we'll go find those morons
from Poxlythera. Lunch is on me.

266
00:26:14,478 --> 00:26:18,297
- Who was that?
- Double A, your partner.

267
00:26:21,432 --> 00:26:25,576
I'm gonna need you to go get me some chocolate
milk, all right, just... a really big glass.

268
00:26:25,677 --> 00:26:28,424
And have you seen K?
Did he call in sick or anything?

269
00:26:28,425 --> 00:26:29,622
Who's K?

270
00:26:30,722 --> 00:26:32,576
All right, all right.

271
00:26:33,553 --> 00:26:34,853
!!! K !!!

272
00:26:35,354 --> 00:26:37,833
All right! You got me!

273
00:26:38,334 --> 00:26:43,939
I'll give it to you, it's funny, very elaborate.
Oh, and all of you, fantastic performances.

274
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:47,206
Can't believe you waited 14 years
to develop a sense of humor,

275
00:26:47,207 --> 00:26:49,009
but this is a good one,

276
00:26:49,010 --> 00:26:53,578
but K, I need you to come out here now, 'cause
I'm really starting to get a little pissed-off.

277
00:26:53,579 --> 00:26:57,922
Agent J, would you mind keeping your voice down!
And telling me it is who you are looking for!

278
00:26:57,923 --> 00:27:01,259
- I'm looking for K!
- Who is K?

279
00:27:03,219 --> 00:27:06,372
- You , too!?! You, too!?!
- I mean who is he to you?

280
00:27:06,373 --> 00:27:09,612
My partner... older gentleman.

281
00:27:09,613 --> 00:27:14,344
100 and 10, maybe 100 and 11 years old.
Sort of a surly Elvis thing happenin' with him.

282
00:27:14,345 --> 00:27:19,332
He smiles... like this...
seen him around?

283
00:27:21,689 --> 00:27:24,219
- I'll take you to K.
- Thank you!

284
00:27:31,486 --> 00:27:32,795
What is that supposed to be?

285
00:27:32,796 --> 00:27:36,262
That's K.
He's been dead for over 40 years.

286
00:27:37,062 --> 00:27:41,022
Ya know, okay, see, the prerequisite
for a joke is that it be funny.

287
00:27:41,023 --> 00:27:42,953
It's never been funny.

288
00:27:48,395 --> 00:27:51,442

295
00:28:08,114 --> 00:28:09,711
That's not what happened.

296
00:28:10,007 --> 00:28:12,085
I just looked at this report.
K put Boris away...

297
00:28:12,086 --> 00:28:13,315
Agent K is dead.

298
00:28:13,316 --> 00:28:15,930
- Well, I just talked to him last night!
- You are imagining things!

299
00:28:15,931 --> 00:28:17,091
I'm not imagining anything.

300
00:28:17,092 --> 00:28:19,131
- I need a psych team up here right now.
- Yes, Ma'am!

301
00:28:19,132 --> 00:28:22,778
Aqua Velva Aftershave.
I didn't imagined that.

302
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:27,193
For every stake-out endless
hours of cowboy music.

303
00:28:27,521 --> 00:28:32,096
Or every morning with his coffee,
and he'd say "I'll tell ya something, Slick,"

304
00:28:32,097 --> 00:28:33,627
"this coffee tastes like dirt! "

305
00:28:33,628 --> 00:28:35,980
And I was supposed to say:
"Whadaya expect?

306
00:28:35,981 --> 00:28:37,849
It was just ground this morning "

307
00:28:38,205 --> 00:28:39,636
How do you know that?

308
00:28:39,637 --> 00:28:41,345
Chocolate milk, Sir!

309
00:28:41,346 --> 00:28:44,368
Where ya been, Man?
It's like a hour ago.

310
00:28:46,586 --> 00:28:50,356
Wait! How long have you been
craving chocolatized dairy products?

311
00:28:50,372 --> 00:28:51,903
Just from today.

312
00:28:52,089 --> 00:28:55,917
Are you experiencing headaches,
dizziness, loss of balance?

313
00:28:56,366 --> 00:28:59,592
- Agitation, depression?
- Hell, yeah!

314
00:29:00,718 --> 00:29:02,013
There are only two possibilities.

315
00:29:02,014 --> 00:29:03,116
One is that's you've been bitten

316
00:29:03,117 --> 00:29:07,817
by the Horwathian Brain Tick and
could die in horrible agony at any moment.

317
00:29:08,811 --> 00:29:11,560
Damn it! It's not the Tick.

318
00:29:11,561 --> 00:29:13,646
"Damn it, it not the Tick"?!?!

319
00:29:14,006 --> 00:29:16,101
There's something worse than the Tick?

320
00:29:18,293 --> 00:29:23,289
Your obsession with chocolate milk indicates that you
might be involved in some sort of a temporal fracture.

321
00:29:23,543 --> 00:29:24,995
I don't know what you're talkin' about.

322
00:29:25,296 --> 00:29:27,953
Chocolate milk relieves
temporal fracture headache.

323
00:29:28,454 --> 00:29:30,814
- What's a temporal fracture?
- A break in the time line.

324
00:29:30,824 --> 00:29:31,946
I don't know what you're talkin' about.

325
00:29:31,947 --> 00:29:33,980
Time travel! Time travel!

326
00:29:34,681 --> 00:29:36,281
There's no such thing as time travel.

327
00:29:36,770 --> 00:29:39,450
- Well, there is!
- No, there's not!

328
00:29:39,799 --> 00:29:41,408
Because, if there were,

329
00:29:41,409 --> 00:29:46,725
a Class One Senior Agent, such as myself,
would have been made aware of it, wouldn't he have?!?

330
00:29:47,226 --> 00:29:50,388
Were it not classified and
way above his pay grade.

331
00:29:50,588 --> 00:29:52,592
You know what? I need a raise.

332
00:29:52,593 --> 00:29:56,285
There was one man, a scumbag, Obadiah Price.
He figured out we busted him,

333
00:29:56,286 --> 00:29:59,796
we made time travel illegal
throughout the Universe,

334
00:29:59,797 --> 00:30:02,240
and he is serving life on LunarMax.

335
00:30:02,302 --> 00:30:05,139
That's where Boris was locked up!

336
00:30:07,212 --> 00:30:09,071
If Boris could work-out
how to time-jump

337
00:30:09,072 --> 00:30:12,438
he... he could seriously
change the course of history.

338
00:30:12,849 --> 00:30:18,323
Attention! Early Warning System engaged!
Inbound hostile warship entering Solar System.

339
00:30:18,358 --> 00:30:20,832
Bogladyte markings and language detected.

340
00:30:20,833 --> 00:30:24,590
Bogladyte.
Boris is a Bogladyte, but they're extinct!

341
00:30:24,591 --> 00:30:28,133
- Apparently not.
- Catastrophic Earth attack imminent.

342
00:30:29,408 --> 00:30:31,517
- Put up the ArcNet!
- The what?

343
00:30:31,918 --> 00:30:35,850
The ArcNet, the defense system,
K got it specifically for the Bogladytes.

344
00:30:36,616 --> 00:30:40,717
There is no K!
He's been dead for over 40 years.

345
00:30:40,922 --> 00:30:46,102
No K. No defense system.
Boris jumped back and killed him.

346
00:30:46,303 --> 00:30:49,645
If you want to save the world,
you're gonna have to stop THAT from happening.

347
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:52,453
You have to find Jeffrey Price,
he's Obadiah's son.

348
00:30:52,454 --> 00:30:55,071
Hope the little squirt
hasn't skipped town.

349
00:30:57,525 --> 00:31:00,373
<i>Good luck, J. This planet's gone.</i>

350
00:31:17,738 --> 00:31:21,053
Hi, How can I help you?
We're having an amazing sale on batteries.

351
00:31:21,178 --> 00:31:24,487
Whoa! Okay, we got other stuff
like headphones, adapters, or...

352
00:31:24,488 --> 00:31:26,628
Did you helped Boris the Animal time-jump?

353
00:31:26,703 --> 00:31:28,629
Whoa, whoa! Okay, I had to!
That dude's a freak!

354
00:31:28,630 --> 00:31:32,204
He killed my partner!
I want to know when and where you sent him!

355
00:31:32,205 --> 00:31:34,119
What? You think I keep like a log book?

356
00:31:40,776 --> 00:31:44,584
- Target vector: July 16, 1969.
- All right, all right!

357
00:31:44,585 --> 00:31:47,993
That's a real bummer, about your buddy,
I'm sure he was like a real great guy,

358
00:31:47,994 --> 00:31:53,010
but in terms of the whole space-time continuum your
friend was like a little blip on the historical radar.

359
00:31:56,907 --> 00:31:59,542
Oh, that's a big blip.

360
00:32:00,729 --> 00:32:05,176
- Okay, what's the plan?
- You're gonna send me back to July 15, 1969.

361
00:32:05,177 --> 00:32:08,082
No! That's a stupid plan because
I sent Boris to July 16.

362
00:32:08,083 --> 00:32:10,994
I'm not worried about that one,
I'm going back and kill the younger Boris

363
00:32:10,995 --> 00:32:12,613
before the older one even shows up.

364
00:32:12,614 --> 00:32:14,925
That way neither of
them will even exist!

365
00:32:15,595 --> 00:32:21,196
That's why you get to wear the black suit.
No? You gonna leave me hangin'?

366
00:32:21,262 --> 00:32:26,869
Ok! Oh! I just thought of  something! Ya know,
even way back then New York was like a big... ish city.

367
00:32:26,870 --> 00:32:31,612
- So, how are you really gonna find him?
- On July 15 Boris killed an alien

368
00:32:31,613 --> 00:32:33,822
Roman the Fabulist at Coney Island.

369
00:32:33,823 --> 00:32:35,923
And you're gonna get there first
and be waiting for him?

370
00:32:36,023 --> 00:32:39,771
- Dude! They should give you like two black suits.
- My Man, for real?

371
00:32:39,772 --> 00:32:41,590
Oh! Right! Sorry!

372
00:32:42,906 --> 00:32:49,051
This is the Real Deal, time-jump gear,
very rare, very old.

373
00:32:49,157 --> 00:32:51,497
But first we gotta get high.

374
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:55,336
- No!
- No, no, I mean really high.

375
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:19,985
Hey.. Man... a little help... here.

376
00:33:23,042 --> 00:33:25,327
Thank you. Okay.

377
00:33:26,723 --> 00:33:29,829
- You know the rules of time-jumps, right?
- Give me the short version.

378
00:33:29,830 --> 00:33:34,106
Okay, if you wanna save your partner,
word of advice, stay away from him.

379
00:33:34,107 --> 00:33:37,196
Yeah, got it, stay away
from K just kill Boris.

380
00:33:37,197 --> 00:33:41,218
Now, take these 'cause it get's
pretty windy on the way down.

381
00:33:42,182 --> 00:33:43,106
The way down?

382
00:33:43,107 --> 00:33:45,747
And with your eyes tearing up
it's hard to read the time dial.

383
00:33:45,748 --> 00:33:49,426
Plus, it helps you look like
a real time traveler, which is cool.

384
00:33:49,427 --> 00:33:51,827
I'm not jumpin' off of this building!

385
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:53,930
Time JUMP!

386
00:33:54,966 --> 00:33:59,826
Okay, now I gotta set
this thing to the 15th.

387
00:33:59,911 --> 00:34:04,253
Uh, that seems right... ish.

388
00:34:05,107 --> 00:34:08,636
Now all ya gotta do... is jump.

389
00:34:08,647 --> 00:34:10,521
Hey! Hey! Stop! Stop it!

390
00:34:11,085 --> 00:34:14,752
Now, as soon as you're moving fast enough, that
circle's gonna fill-up with  some sort of

391
00:34:14,753 --> 00:34:18,826
green time travel liquid or somesuch
and it's gonna glow really bright.

392
00:34:18,827 --> 00:34:21,055
As soon as that happens,
you need to break that

393
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:23,607
blue laser line with your
thumb to complete the circuit.

394
00:34:23,656 --> 00:34:26,689
At this height that should be, uh...
let's see...

395
00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:29,126
mass of Earth at thirty-something
feet per minute, uh...

396
00:34:29,127 --> 00:34:31,436
That's 32 feet per second per second.

397
00:34:31,437 --> 00:34:33,449
That sound right... ish.

398
00:34:33,450 --> 00:34:38,165
So that would be, uh, I guess...
about 2 feet off the ground.

399
00:34:38,166 --> 00:34:40,375
- Yeah, break the laser line?
- No! Don't break it!

400
00:34:40,376 --> 00:34:42,701
- No, I mean when I'm fast enough.
- Sounds good!

401
00:34:42,702 --> 00:34:46,016
Boy, do I break the laser line
or do I NOT break the laser line?

402
00:34:46,017 --> 00:34:51,721
Do not lose that time device,
or you will be stuck in 1969.

403
00:34:52,201 --> 00:34:55,435
Wasn't the best time for your people.

404
00:34:56,438 --> 00:35:00,927
- I'm just sayin', it's like a lot cooler now.
- How will I know if it works?

405
00:35:00,928 --> 00:35:05,210
You'll either know... or you won't.

406
00:35:11,731 --> 00:35:14,005
You must really love this guy to do this.

407
00:35:14,106 --> 00:35:17,464
Oh, wait! How come I remember K
but nobody else does?

408
00:35:19,602 --> 00:35:22,935
- Whoa! That means you were there!
- I was where?

409
00:35:22,936 --> 00:35:26,055
If you survive you gotta come
back and tell me everything, okay?

410
00:35:26,056 --> 00:35:27,284
Where was I?

411
00:35:28,451 --> 00:35:31,165
You gotta go! Go! Go! Go!

412
00:36:13,856 --> 00:36:15,437
Move!

413
00:37:49,939 --> 00:37:52,874
- My Man, what's today?
- Tuesday!

414
00:37:52,875 --> 00:37:54,477
- The date?
- The 15th.

415
00:37:54,506 --> 00:37:56,055
- Of?
- July?

416
00:37:56,056 --> 00:37:58,647
- Dawg, the year?
- 1969.

417
00:37:58,648 --> 00:38:02,604
Thank you.
You look at me like I'm crazy.

418
00:38:32,398 --> 00:38:34,552
- Get us checked in!
- Yeah Yeah!

419
00:38:35,706 --> 00:38:39,030
Hey! Hey! Do me a favor, all right?
Just be careful with the luggage!

420
00:38:39,328 --> 00:38:40,462
Absolutely, Sir.

421
00:38:40,863 --> 00:38:42,391
<i>Paid a lot of
money for that luggage.</i>

422
00:38:42,892 --> 00:38:43,995
<i>We'll take very good care of...</i>

423
00:38:43,996 --> 00:38:46,506
<i>Because last time I was here it got
scuffed-up and I had to replace it.</i>

424
00:38:46,555 --> 00:38:49,157
Here ya go, Sir.
Just call down when you need it.

425
00:38:51,268 --> 00:38:54,353
- There's more luggage in the trunk.
- Uh, uh, yeah, it'll be in your room, Sir.

426
00:38:54,354 --> 00:38:55,695
Just... go ahead.

427
00:38:56,696 --> 00:38:58,684
Excuse me! Who was that?
Who you are?

428
00:39:06,157 --> 00:39:07,173
Let's go!

429
00:39:24,722 --> 00:39:27,739
- Far out, Man!
- If you want to keep that,

430
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:31,259
- I wouldn't.
- Make your love, not war!

431
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:34,549
I prefer to do both.

432
00:40:09,957 --> 00:40:12,097
How are you officers,
what can I do you for?

433
00:40:12,130 --> 00:40:15,637
Well, look at this,
power windows, power seats.

434
00:40:15,953 --> 00:40:21,210
- I betcha the thing cost six grand, Man.
- Yes! And it has a roof, but it's hidden.

435
00:40:21,585 --> 00:40:26,000
Hey! What kind of a work do you do?
An individual of your particular...

436
00:40:26,001 --> 00:40:27,935
ethnic persuasion?

437
00:40:29,025 --> 00:40:30,896
<i>Maybe he's a noted athlete.</i>

438
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:37,095
Yes! Uh... starting forward
for the Detroit Darkies.

439
00:40:37,556 --> 00:40:39,899
- Where did you get the car?
- And the suit?

440
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:44,146
I stole them both. Uh, car from your wife,
suit from your grandmother.

441
00:40:46,101 --> 00:40:47,201
Hey!!

442
00:40:47,302 --> 00:40:50,744
- What do we have here, a concealed weapon?
- Hey! It's his grandmother's suit!

443
00:40:50,745 --> 00:40:53,175
- Hey, what's this?
- Probably drugs.

444
00:40:53,176 --> 00:40:56,290
Listen, I have rights and I demand
to see my lawyer before you

445
00:40:56,291 --> 00:40:58,856
press that small button
on the side firmly

446
00:40:58,857 --> 00:40:59,994
Press it!

447
00:41:04,809 --> 00:41:09,450
That, gentlemen, is a standard issue neuralizor...
but you're not gonna remember that.

448
00:41:09,451 --> 00:41:14,309
And just because you see a black man
drivin' in a nice car, does not mean it's stolen!

449
00:41:17,464 --> 00:41:21,064
I stole that one,
but not 'cause I'm black!

450
00:41:24,452 --> 00:41:26,014
I'll be done with the
car in a just a minute.

451
00:41:26,015 --> 00:41:29,427
He prefers that he take it back to
the jerk at the Roosevelt Hotel.

452
00:41:44,511 --> 00:41:48,450
- Where is the Arcanan?
- You are too late!

453
00:41:48,451 --> 00:41:51,785
He is going to give the humans the ArcNet.

454
00:41:53,687 --> 00:41:56,072
Let's agree to disagree.

455
00:42:26,605 --> 00:42:32,740
- We'll take it from here!
- K? K! K!

456
00:42:49,495 --> 00:42:52,569
Dad! I'm on Earth.
I need bail.

457
00:43:10,768 --> 00:43:15,872
You need to turn electricity
down on that damned thing...

458
00:43:15,873 --> 00:43:17,823
can't taste my frickin' tongue, K.

459
00:43:17,928 --> 00:43:19,474
How did you know my name?

460
00:43:21,503 --> 00:43:27,508
What, 'cause I called you K?
Naw, I call everybody K, it's kinda my... my thing.

461
00:43:27,509 --> 00:43:29,210
What up, K?

462
00:43:29,584 --> 00:43:34,221
All right, I sorta... K!
Plus... it's... it's kinda my thing.

463
00:43:34,222 --> 00:43:37,447
I just... uh... some people like it...
most people.

464
00:43:38,677 --> 00:43:41,257
Now I know what you look
like when you're lyin'.

465
00:43:41,442 --> 00:43:44,233
why don't you show me what you
look like when you're tellin' the truth.

466
00:43:44,869 --> 00:43:48,153
I won those at Coney Island
on the Ring Toss.

467
00:43:48,154 --> 00:43:52,891
I won a stuffed bear once but
never one of these... must be good, Slick.

468
00:43:52,905 --> 00:43:55,496
All right... Sir,
I was mindin' my own business,

469
00:43:55,497 --> 00:44:00,950
I was out there waitin' for my girl, who, by the way,
is probably worried sick lookin' for me, right now,

470
00:44:00,951 --> 00:44:03,883
So, I... I... I just... I... I need my things
and I need to get back to her.

471
00:44:03,884 --> 00:44:05,732
- What's your gal's name?
- Huh?

472
00:44:06,176 --> 00:44:07,797
Your gal, what's her name?

473
00:44:08,314 --> 00:44:10,263
...Schteron.

474
00:44:13,145 --> 00:44:14,603
Schteron?

475
00:44:18,783 --> 00:44:21,198
Bet Schteron likes that
suit of yours, hmm?

476
00:44:22,196 --> 00:44:24,244
Why, is it a crime to wear a black suit?

477
00:44:24,245 --> 00:44:28,106
All right, listen, I haven't done
anything wrong and I need to get outta here.

478
00:44:28,107 --> 00:44:29,725
Sir! I cannot be here with you.

479
00:44:29,726 --> 00:44:34,135
Terribly sorry, X is frightfully upset
about the whole Coney Island incident.

480
00:44:34,136 --> 00:44:35,508
Thanks for the heads-up.

481
00:44:37,303 --> 00:44:39,657
Oh, man, this coffee tastes like dirt!

482
00:44:39,734 --> 00:44:40,770
What do you expect, it was ground...

483
00:44:40,771 --> 00:44:42,401
<i>ground this morning!</i>

484
00:44:43,856 --> 00:44:44,743
O?

485
00:44:48,828 --> 00:44:51,031
Naw, I call ladies O.

486
00:44:51,075 --> 00:44:53,810
For me O is feminine,
K is masculine.

487
00:44:54,309 --> 00:44:57,897
Ya, know, I see a couple, I'm like O-K.

488
00:44:58,896 --> 00:45:03,355
- What a mess! Any casualties?
- Yes. Roman the Fabulist.

489
00:45:03,667 --> 00:45:07,632
- Any HUMAN casualties?
- No, Sir!

490
00:45:09,191 --> 00:45:10,669
Who the hell is this?

491
00:45:10,780 --> 00:45:13,604
- Look, I was...
- Stray human, he was caught in the net.

492
00:45:14,005 --> 00:45:15,251
Code 43 him and throw him back.

493
00:45:15,252 --> 00:45:19,419
Sir, you're going to be late for your meeting
with Viagrans, they have a revolutionary new pill.

494
00:45:19,420 --> 00:45:20,967
It's really...

495
00:45:22,150 --> 00:45:23,388
Okay, Slick...

496
00:45:26,642 --> 00:45:29,235
- I was waitin' for my girl.
- Schteron?

497
00:45:29,236 --> 00:45:31,629
Yes, she's Greek.

498
00:45:33,039 --> 00:45:37,002
Okay, just one last thing, an eye exam.

499
00:45:42,561 --> 00:45:45,825
That's not eye exam, K,
that's a big damn Neuralizor.

500
00:45:45,826 --> 00:45:49,052
You sure have a lot of information
for a fella who doesn't know anything.

501
00:45:49,053 --> 00:45:53,978
I... I see what you sayin'. Whoa! uh, hey,
you know what, K, we need to... hold up a second! K!

502
00:45:55,502 --> 00:45:59,314
- Let's just get this bite-card in here.
- Hey! Back up! Back up!

503
00:46:00,379 --> 00:46:05,538
K, listen. I think we got off on the wrong foot,
a'ight, so let's just stop for a second and talk.

504
00:46:05,539 --> 00:46:07,175
Don't put me in here, K.

505
00:46:07,176 --> 00:46:11,846
- Laid off!
- K, no, listen to me, I can help you with this case.

506
00:46:12,946 --> 00:46:15,446
!!! K !!!

507
00:46:15,747 --> 00:46:19,534
- I'm doin' the Truth Face, you're missin' it!
- Naw, I'll just use my imagination.

508
00:46:22,989 --> 00:46:28,005
Hey, the killer you're lookin' for, I messed with
the same guy, he's a Bogladyte, his name is Boris.

509
00:46:28,006 --> 00:46:29,363
Ship has sailed, Amigo.

510
00:46:29,364 --> 00:46:33,322
- K, if don't get 'im now there're be two of 'em.
- You have my undivided attention.

511
00:46:33,748 --> 00:46:35,779
One goin' have one arm,
one goin' have two.

512
00:46:36,111 --> 00:46:40,638
K, listen to me! If you erase
me you erase the whole world.

513
00:46:42,874 --> 00:46:45,834
15 seconds to neuralization.

514
00:46:45,866 --> 00:46:48,895
14, 13, 12

515
00:46:49,050 --> 00:46:52,401
11, 10, 9

516
00:46:52,402 --> 00:46:54,715
When you see Boris tomorrow, K, kill 'im!

517
00:46:54,716 --> 00:46:57,105
Do not arrest him, kill him!

518
00:47:07,085 --> 00:47:11,333
Is this thing off?
Hey, I don't think it's all the way off, K.

519
00:47:11,335 --> 00:47:13,450
It's whirrin', it's buzzin'.

520
00:47:14,263 --> 00:47:16,193
I don't know if I don't know nothin'.

521
00:47:20,673 --> 00:47:25,811
I knew Roman, his wife cooked me dinner once,
and while it was not pleasant, he was my friend.

522
00:47:27,256 --> 00:47:30,064
Last chance, who are you
and what do you know?

523
00:47:34,992 --> 00:47:37,516
I'm a agent o' Men in Black
but I'm from the future, we're partners.

524
00:47:37,517 --> 00:47:39,581
25 years from now you're gonna recruit me

525
00:47:39,582 --> 00:47:42,782
and 14 years after that, the guy you
didn't let me kill today at Coney Island

526
00:47:42,882 --> 00:47:44,857
he escapes from prison
and jumps back in the past

527
00:47:44,858 --> 00:47:46,806
and unleashes a full
scale invasion of Earth.

528
00:47:46,807 --> 00:47:51,132
We have about 19 hours to catch him and kill him,
so if we're leavin', we have to go right now.

529
00:47:59,505 --> 00:48:00,469
All right.

530
00:48:06,130 --> 00:48:07,651
So that's the story you believe?

531
00:48:07,652 --> 00:48:11,192
That one was the truth. It wasn't the
whole truth, but I guess it'll do for now.

532
00:48:11,193 --> 00:48:13,528
What the hell you talkin' about,
of course it's the whole truth.

533
00:48:13,529 --> 00:48:17,675
I told you everything. The problem with a lie
is once you start lyin' you put yourself...

534
00:48:21,913 --> 00:48:27,072
- Agent K! What's he still doing here?
- Oh, I mighta cooked him for too long

535
00:48:27,073 --> 00:48:28,749
thought I'd better walk 'im out.

536
00:48:28,750 --> 00:48:30,293
I put my pants on.

537
00:48:35,933 --> 00:48:37,945
Okay, Futureman, where to?

538
00:48:39,268 --> 00:48:41,833
- I don't know!?
- What do you mean you don't know?

539
00:48:43,904 --> 00:48:47,687
I do not know,
go wherever you went last time.

540
00:48:47,688 --> 00:48:50,455
I haven't been here "last time",
I didn't tell you where I went.

541
00:48:50,487 --> 00:48:53,761
No, I mean, we don't really talk.

542
00:48:54,231 --> 00:48:58,305
What kind of partners sit in a car all day,
every day for 14 years and don't talk?

543
00:48:58,306 --> 00:49:04,204
Exactly! And this is the type of problem it causes...
dysfunctional.

544
00:49:04,205 --> 00:49:08,504
All right, Sport, you better get useful
real quick or goin' back in room 43.

545
00:49:09,782 --> 00:49:10,600
Man!

546
00:49:12,987 --> 00:49:17,067
Uh, uh, there was something in
the file about a factory.

547
00:49:17,432 --> 00:49:19,958
Something happened at a factory.

548
00:49:21,769 --> 00:49:27,105
Hey, look, Man, you can put your Jedi Knight
on me all you want, that's all I got.

549
00:49:32,270 --> 00:49:36,611
- That spark somethin'?
- Roman had this on his person when he was murdered.

550
00:49:38,091 --> 00:49:40,116
- It's a matchbook.
- No.

551
00:49:40,117 --> 00:49:43,031
It's a clue... he didn't smoke.

552
00:50:12,822 --> 00:50:15,508
- Did you lose somethin' over here, Hondo?
- No!

553
00:50:16,460 --> 00:50:18,540
Hey, Man, hey, how old are you?

554
00:50:21,848 --> 00:50:25,867
- 29.
- You have some city-miles on you.

555
00:50:26,183 --> 00:50:28,240
I'm startin' to understand
why we don't talk.

556
00:50:35,667 --> 00:50:38,710
- How well you know this place?
- I know its reputation.

557
00:50:38,848 --> 00:50:42,140
I don't like it, I hate goin' in blind,
and I'm gonna need my gun.

558
00:50:43,329 --> 00:50:46,242
- Sure thing, Slick!
- Whoa! K!

559
00:50:46,289 --> 00:50:47,991
Wait! No! I gotta go in with you.

560
00:50:47,992 --> 00:50:51,387
- You just sit tough, I'll be fine.
- Wait! No! No!

561
00:50:52,381 --> 00:50:55,177
K! K! Don't go in by yourself!

562
00:50:58,358 --> 00:50:59,547
Hiya, Fellas!

563
00:51:01,748 --> 00:51:04,948
- Need to see the Boss.
- He's busy!

564
00:51:05,782 --> 00:51:07,920
All right, well, I'm just gonna
take a look around.

565
00:51:13,401 --> 00:51:17,577
- Looks like what we have ourselves a stand-off.
- Looks that way.

566
00:51:22,226 --> 00:51:24,043
Still keep the key under the ashtray.

567
00:51:24,044 --> 00:51:25,294
Lucky guess.

568
00:51:25,395 --> 00:51:28,864
- Now, where were we?
- I was just about to tell you to screw off.

569
00:51:29,165 --> 00:51:33,479
- Hey, Slick, you bowl in the future?
- Absolutely, MIB League champ three years runnin'.

570
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:34,619
Oh... let's see it.

571
00:51:35,666 --> 00:51:39,099
Oooh! You do not just walk into
my establishment and rip my head off?

572
00:51:39,100 --> 00:51:42,968
My Man, look, we don't have a lot of time for this,
you really need to tell him somethin'!

573
00:51:42,969 --> 00:51:45,949
- I'll tell him this!
- All right, your head.

574
00:51:45,950 --> 00:51:48,491
Wait! Hey! If you do this

575
00:51:48,492 --> 00:51:52,059
I am gonna hunt you down and I will
make sure that you walk funny for...

576
00:51:56,407 --> 00:51:57,524
Touchdown, Slick!

577
00:51:57,525 --> 00:51:58,837
You messed with the wrong head.

578
00:51:59,338 --> 00:52:01,942
- His head is a little...
- You gonna tell us where Dom is?

579
00:52:02,850 --> 00:52:05,520
Kill you both! I swear
I'll kill both of you!

580
00:52:05,878 --> 00:52:07,304
Ow!

581
00:52:07,952 --> 00:52:09,824
Think your hook's a little
off, want me to clean 'er.

582
00:52:09,825 --> 00:52:10,794
Oh, yeah, sure thing!

583
00:52:10,795 --> 00:52:15,226
Oh! No! No! No! Aw, c'mon, I was just
cleanin' the bathroom with this thing.

584
00:52:15,227 --> 00:52:17,814
Please, no cleaning, no cleaning,
no cleaning, okay!

585
00:52:18,870 --> 00:52:22,200
Okay already! All right, he's
in the back, but he's not gonna

586
00:52:22,201 --> 00:52:25,638
talk to any Men in Black scum
like you! Now give me back my head!

587
00:52:26,389 --> 00:52:29,313
K, I call this one Low Penny Fruit.

588
00:52:29,314 --> 00:52:32,191
That ain't a finger hole,
you sick bastard!

589
00:52:38,755 --> 00:52:40,414
I'm gonna kill both of you!
I'm gonna kill the both of you...

590
00:52:47,340 --> 00:52:50,119
- Well, we're on the right track.
- It's the wrong train.

591
00:52:50,520 --> 00:52:53,275
If he had any secrets,
I guess he spilled them.

592
00:52:53,276 --> 00:52:55,768
Smart man would figure out
what your victims have in common.

593
00:52:55,769 --> 00:52:57,092
A smart man would.

594
00:52:57,796 --> 00:52:59,634
That's a big-ass phone.

595
00:53:00,287 --> 00:53:02,333
- Don't put that up to your head.
- Agent O

596
00:53:02,334 --> 00:53:05,064
How's your day been, Agent K?

597
00:53:05,539 --> 00:53:07,797
<i>Oh, fair to middlin',
how things goin' with you?</i>

598
00:53:07,798 --> 00:53:08,665
Very good, thank you!

599
00:53:08,712 --> 00:53:10,836
Hey! You saw her about a hour ago.

600
00:53:11,137 --> 00:53:15,049
I need cleanup and containment at Cosmic Lanes.
Now, listen, I got a dead Parlaxian.

601
00:53:15,374 --> 00:53:17,239
Now, Roman was a Bivoid.

602
00:53:17,340 --> 00:53:19,556
Correct me if I'm wrong,
but from the same planetary groupin'?

603
00:53:19,557 --> 00:53:22,270
<i>Yes, the Three Planet System
in the Triangulan Galaxy</i>

604
00:53:22,271 --> 00:53:23,627
wiped-out by the Bogladytes.

605
00:53:23,728 --> 00:53:25,980
- And that third planet, wasn't it...
- Glamoria.

606
00:53:25,981 --> 00:53:27,481
<i>Glamoria.</i>

607
00:53:28,273 --> 00:53:29,428
Thank you, Miss O.

608
00:53:30,333 --> 00:53:34,360
I know where Boris is headed to next.
You were close, Slick.

609
00:53:34,361 --> 00:53:37,213
It's not a factory, it's The Factory.

610
00:53:41,585 --> 00:53:45,531
All right, look, if Boris turns out to be in here,
I'm gonna kill him, I need my gun.

611
00:53:45,717 --> 00:53:46,871
No deal.

612
00:53:49,498 --> 00:53:53,042
I've been an agent for 14 years, which means
that I am the senior agent on this case.

613
00:53:53,043 --> 00:53:56,850
Now, I hate to pull rank, but as senior
agent I am instructing my junior agent,

614
00:53:56,851 --> 00:53:59,463
that's you, to give me my
gun right now, that's an order.

615
00:54:06,399 --> 00:54:08,093
No. no, no! Space Gun!

616
00:54:08,211 --> 00:54:09,336
You're welcome.

617
00:54:10,713 --> 00:54:12,130
I didn't say, "Thank you".

618
00:54:17,836 --> 00:54:20,857
For such an ungainly species,
they really thrived here on Earth.

619
00:54:20,858 --> 00:54:24,537
Yeah, I was an Agent for three years
before I realized all models were aliens.

620
00:54:24,538 --> 00:54:26,525
I found out the hard way.

621
00:54:27,522 --> 00:54:30,595
- Password.
- Hey, look, Funky Sixties Dude,

622
00:54:30,596 --> 00:54:32,638
- we don’t have a lot of time to...
- Janice Chaplin!

623
00:54:41,171 --> 00:54:43,155
Anybody here who's NOT an alien?

624
00:54:48,692 --> 00:54:53,095
Very nice. Wait. That's perfect.
Look at the camera.

625
00:54:53,096 --> 00:54:54,655
Is that Andy Warhol?

626
00:54:56,634 --> 00:54:57,509
Yep.

627
00:55:00,146 --> 00:55:02,826
Excuse me, Mr. Warhol,
can we have a minute?

628
00:55:03,510 --> 00:55:07,076
Now is not a good time,
this is a Be-In.

629
00:55:07,426 --> 00:55:08,738
Just a few questions.

630
00:55:09,424 --> 00:55:14,571
No questions, no answers... just be!

631
00:55:14,828 --> 00:55:19,283
We have an urgent matter we'd like to discuss
with you regarding one of your party guests.

632
00:55:20,364 --> 00:55:26,149
Why don't you come back next week
after the Happening has happened.

633
00:55:26,550 --> 00:55:30,327
I'm sorry, Mr. Warhol, you like talkin' really slow,
we got important stuff to do.

634
00:55:30,328 --> 00:55:31,918
And I got a planet to save.

635
00:55:32,553 --> 00:55:35,016
You're distressing, everything
about you upsets me.

636
00:55:39,007 --> 00:55:41,811
Aw, damn it, K!
What, you tryin' to blow my cover?

637
00:55:41,812 --> 00:55:45,627
- Agent W, your cover is safe!
- Whoa! Andy Warhol is one of us?

638
00:55:45,628 --> 00:55:48,289
"Safe", you outta your mind?
I'm short of ideas on

639
00:55:48,290 --> 00:55:51,181
painting soup cans and
bananas, for Chrissakes!

640
00:55:51,182 --> 00:55:54,034
Actually, Mr. Warhol,
I gotta tell you, I really love your work.

641
00:55:54,035 --> 00:55:56,673
Oh, oh, thank you. Who's the dumb ass?

642
00:55:56,974 --> 00:55:59,908
Whoa! Hey! How about a little
professional courtesy here?

643
00:55:59,909 --> 00:56:01,513
- What's that Dumb Ass?
- Say it again.

644
00:56:01,514 --> 00:56:02,750
- You want me to?
- I dare you.

645
00:56:02,751 --> 00:56:04,305
- Dumb Ass.
- Agents.

646
00:56:04,306 --> 00:56:08,317
You know, I don't have no problem with
pimp slappin' the shiznit outta Andy Warhol.

647
00:56:08,656 --> 00:56:09,592
What?

648
00:56:14,723 --> 00:56:16,340
Why you lookin' at me?

649
00:56:18,742 --> 00:56:24,455
Oh, all right, you know what, Agent K, why don't
you see what information you can get from Agent W

650
00:56:24,456 --> 00:56:27,791
and I'll go to case the perimeter.
Does that work for everybody?

651
00:56:27,792 --> 00:56:29,432
- Go do that!
-All right, how about that?

652
00:56:29,433 --> 00:56:31,487
- Oh, cute. - Okay? - Very nice.

653
00:56:32,224 --> 00:56:34,629
Someone forget his nap...huh?

654
00:56:42,619 --> 00:56:46,585
- Hey! How you doin'?
- Chillin'.

655
00:56:52,487 --> 00:56:54,905
Who's that guy?
Okay, don't tell me he's your new partner.

656
00:56:54,955 --> 00:56:58,849
Actually he's my old partner, he traveled
back from the future to save the planet.

657
00:56:58,850 --> 00:57:00,758
Jesus! Stop!
Don't tell me, I don't want to know.

658
00:57:00,912 --> 00:57:02,831
<i> Andy! Yoko's here.</i>

659
00:57:05,958 --> 00:57:10,110
All right, tell her that I'm filming
this man eating a hamburger.

660
00:57:10,311 --> 00:57:15,891
It's transcendent.
All right, now, the pickle.

661
00:57:22,950 --> 00:57:24,463
So, what are you doing on my turf, K?

662
00:57:24,764 --> 00:57:28,842
Trackin', a killer, Bogladyte. We have reason to
believe he's gonna hit here next, a Glamorian.

663
00:57:28,843 --> 00:57:33,772
Glamorian? Right solar system, wrong planet.
I think he's gotta be after the Arcanan.

664
00:57:33,773 --> 00:57:36,501
- No, Arcanans are extinct.
- Well, apparently they're not.

665
00:57:36,702 --> 00:57:41,499
One washed ashore last week. the whole
Roswell circuit's all abuzz about it.

666
00:57:41,900 --> 00:57:46,093
Alien unicorn, the last of the species.
His name is Griffin.

667
00:57:46,143 --> 00:57:47,982
Griffin the Arcanan.

668
00:57:50,395 --> 00:57:51,022
How's it going?

669
00:57:51,703 --> 00:57:53,726
Going? How's it going?
Well that depends. For me

670
00:57:53,727 --> 00:57:56,086
personally it's good, things are
good. Unless, of course, we're

671
00:57:56,087 --> 00:57:59,320
the Possible Future where the muscle-boy near
the door gets into an argument with his girlfriend

672
00:57:59,470 --> 00:58:01,494
which causes her to storm away
and bump into the guy carrying the

673
00:58:01,495 --> 00:58:04,319
stuffed mushrooms and then dumps
the pan that into sailors on leave

674
00:58:04,320 --> 00:58:07,121
and a shoving match breaks
and they crash into the coffee table here

675
00:58:07,122 --> 00:58:09,522
in which case, I gotta
move my plate right now.

676
00:58:13,232 --> 00:58:17,441
Or if it's the Possible Future in which the pastrami
sandwich I'm eating causes me gastric distress.

677
00:58:17,842 --> 00:58:21,958
But, thankfully, your friend, Sir, will offer some
of the antacids he carries in his right pocket.

678
00:58:21,959 --> 00:58:23,216
So, good, I'll be good.

679
00:58:23,717 --> 00:58:26,587
Except in the case the Possible Future
where I have to leave in 2 and a half minutes,

680
00:58:26,588 --> 00:58:29,237
just before he has a chance
to offer me the antacid, so,

681
00:58:29,238 --> 00:58:31,747
on the whole, I'd have to
say, not good, I am not good.

682
00:58:34,437 --> 00:58:35,606
But that depends.

683
00:58:38,457 --> 00:58:39,547
K.

684
00:58:40,250 --> 00:58:42,624
- Now, how we gonna find this guy?
- What am I, a schmuck?

685
00:58:43,438 --> 00:58:44,483
What, he's here?

686
00:58:44,484 --> 00:58:46,067
Well, "here" is a relative term.

687
00:58:46,068 --> 00:58:48,979
He's a fifth dimensional
being but he can live in

688
00:58:48,980 --> 00:58:53,230
and visualize an infinite set of
time-space probabilities simultaneously.

689
00:58:53,273 --> 00:58:56,578
- All right, sound like fun. Good work.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, K, K, K.

690
00:58:57,781 --> 00:59:02,481
Ya gotta fake my death. Okay.
I can't listen to sitar music anymore.

691
00:59:02,482 --> 00:59:07,109
- I'll see what I can do, I'll talk to X.
- K, I can't tell the women from the men!

692
00:59:07,707 --> 00:59:11,191
- May I see your watch?
- Oh, it is 7:18.

693
00:59:11,192 --> 00:59:13,657
No, no, no, your other watch!
The one your father gave you.

694
00:59:15,617 --> 00:59:17,976
How do you know about my father's watch?

695
00:59:21,339 --> 00:59:22,977
Oh, dear!

696
00:59:23,077 --> 00:59:25,778
This is the one where Roman is dead,
and the gentleman at the bowling alley...

697
00:59:25,779 --> 00:59:27,318
so much death.

698
00:59:27,666 --> 00:59:31,140
Such an infinitesimally
small chance for success.

699
00:59:31,813 --> 00:59:36,123
- K!
- Griffin, right? Hey! We're here because of...

700
00:59:36,180 --> 00:59:37,978
- Boris the Animal.
- Correct! We believe he may be coming...

701
00:59:37,985 --> 00:59:39,848
to kill me! Yes! He'll be
here in less than two minutes,

702
00:59:39,849 --> 00:59:41,384
unless, of course, we're
in the Possible Future,

703
00:59:41,385 --> 00:59:44,486
where he made all the green lights on Bowery,
and got here early and is just about to discharge

704
00:59:44,518 --> 00:59:47,155
a weapon from the doorway,
in which case we're all dead in two seconds.

705
00:59:49,317 --> 00:59:53,471
- Ach! Good! That was a close one.
- All right, K, I need a Space Gun.

706
00:59:53,572 --> 00:59:55,789
The Bogladytes consume
any planet in their path,

707
00:59:55,790 --> 00:59:58,782
Mine, Roman's, the Parlaxians,
I tried to stop them, but

708
00:59:58,783 --> 01:00:02,829
if we can stop them here, if we can deny
them Earth, we can stop them forever,

709
01:00:02,877 --> 01:00:05,241
they'll starve before
they reach the next planet!

710
01:00:07,746 --> 01:00:11,090
- 63 seconds!
- How do we do that... stop 'em?

711
01:00:11,431 --> 01:00:13,591
What? Oh!

712
01:00:13,606 --> 01:00:18,068
Sorry, I have something for you.
A gift. It can protect you.

713
01:00:18,526 --> 01:00:24,294
I had to hide it from Boris, but if I
find me again... I'll give it to you.

714
01:00:24,728 --> 01:00:28,541
Thank you. What a game!
Amazing! It's a real miracle!

715
01:00:28,542 --> 01:00:31,891
- Whoa! Whoa! What do you mean? Wha... what miracle?
- What, 30 seconds, I have to go!

716
01:00:31,892 --> 01:00:35,263
- Wait!  No, no, no! We gotcha!
- Negative Possibilities are multiplying

717
01:00:35,264 --> 01:00:37,334
as we speak! 20 seconds!

718
01:00:37,335 --> 01:00:39,443
All right... just... we...
we got it, I'll take it out front...

719
01:00:39,444 --> 01:00:42,106
If your watch is broken and
I have an gastric distress...

720
01:00:42,107 --> 01:00:44,008
<i>Find your place in the world...</i>

721
01:00:44,211 --> 01:00:45,416
Oh, dear!

722
01:00:46,617 --> 01:00:50,840
This is the one where Boris is
comin' through that door in 12, 11, 10...

723
01:00:50,965 --> 01:00:53,855
Wait! Did you have chocolate
milk this morning?

724
01:00:55,144 --> 01:00:57,185
- Yes!
- Cindy.

725
01:00:59,326 --> 01:01:01,448
- K! Boyfriend!
- Go 'im!

726
01:01:10,444 --> 01:01:11,556
Damn it!

727
01:01:30,844 --> 01:01:34,107
- I'm good! I'm good! Whatchya got?
- Nada.

728
01:01:34,714 --> 01:01:39,783
- Damn it! We had 'im!
- Relax, Cochise, we'll find 'im!

729
01:01:39,856 --> 01:01:44,642
First of all, my name is J, okay? It's not Son,
it's not Slick, and it damn sure ain't no Cochise.

730
01:01:45,043 --> 01:01:47,266
I'm not gonna relax 'cause
we're runnin' out of time,

731
01:01:47,267 --> 01:01:49,488
we're runnin' out of clues,
and there's invasion comin'!

732
01:01:49,489 --> 01:01:53,041
You not really recognizin'
my voicial intensity!

733
01:01:53,846 --> 01:01:57,837
Oh! But there was one guy, and he can help.
Where... hey, Griffin!

734
01:01:57,838 --> 01:02:02,687
Griffin! Where's Griffin!
Griffin. Where's Griffin at, K? He's gone!

735
01:02:02,747 --> 01:02:05,887
If Boris get to him before we do,
that's no bueno!

736
01:02:05,888 --> 01:02:08,553
- We need pie.
- What?

737
01:02:08,554 --> 01:02:12,047
My grandaddy always said if you
got a problem that can't solve,

738
01:02:12,376 --> 01:02:15,102
helps to get it outta your head.
Pie. It's good.

739
01:02:15,166 --> 01:02:16,260
- Pie?
- Yep.

740
01:02:16,261 --> 01:02:19,490
- Your grandaddy, heavyset man?
- Little bit.

741
01:02:20,169 --> 01:02:23,526
You know what? We been doin'
smart stuff, we've been followin' clues,

742
01:02:23,527 --> 01:02:27,426
doin' real police work,
it might be time we do somethin' stupid.

743
01:02:27,604 --> 01:02:29,946
Somethin' that ain't got nuttin' to do
with nuttin'! Ah, you know what,

744
01:02:29,947 --> 01:02:34,352
now I want some pie, K! I want some pie,
let's go get some Dumbass Pie!

745
01:02:34,357 --> 01:02:35,529
Sounds good.

746
01:03:05,753 --> 01:03:08,808
- You have any specials?
- My associate will have the same thing

747
01:03:08,809 --> 01:03:12,500
he always has after he looks at the menu for
10 minutes and asks about the specials twice,

748
01:03:12,501 --> 01:03:15,447
he's gonna have a slice of apple pie
with a nasty piece of cheddar.

749
01:03:15,448 --> 01:03:19,253
I'm gonna have the strawberry rhubarb, since it's
my last meal, I'm gonna splurge a little bit.

750
01:03:22,341 --> 01:03:25,756
World class serial killer out
there and we're havin' pie.

751
01:03:26,149 --> 01:03:27,863
Whadaya do in your spare time, Stretch?

752
01:03:29,629 --> 01:03:32,970
See, I sense you're not
embracin' the concept here,

753
01:03:33,730 --> 01:03:35,445
pie don't work unless you let it.

754
01:03:35,846 --> 01:03:37,027
I'm gonna let it.

755
01:03:37,341 --> 01:03:42,110
And you say we don't talk, right?
You go 'head! Ask me any question, anything you want,

756
01:03:42,579 --> 01:03:46,487
as long as it doesn't have to do
with the case, just let 'er rip!

757
01:03:48,275 --> 01:03:49,428
What's up with you and O?

758
01:03:51,695 --> 01:03:54,709
- Me and O?
- Yeah, you and O.

759
01:03:55,010 --> 01:03:57,687
All right, all right.
All right, this is it,

760
01:03:59,424 --> 01:04:03,826
A while back I was assigned to keep
tabs on a musician, Mick Jagger,

761
01:04:04,027 --> 01:04:06,308
he was in this British band,
Rolling Stones.

762
01:04:06,309 --> 01:04:07,418
Rings a bell.

763
01:04:07,419 --> 01:04:11,125
We believed he was on the planet
to breed with Earth women,

764
01:04:11,126 --> 01:04:14,398
and, so, I was in London
and that's when I met O.

765
01:04:14,438 --> 01:04:19,097
Smart, funny, great smile,

766
01:04:19,564 --> 01:04:27,308
and we find ourselves in this pub, which is a bar,
all right, warm beer and the worst food you ever ate.

767
01:04:27,361 --> 01:04:30,748
We just played darts...
'til the sun came up.

768
01:04:31,170 --> 01:04:32,952
Neither of us wanted to leave.

769
01:04:42,525 --> 01:04:44,547
What the hell happened to you, man?

770
01:04:44,548 --> 01:04:46,658
I don't know, it hasn't happened yet.

771
01:04:47,194 --> 01:04:51,276
No, what about you, Slick?
In the future, you got yourself a girl?

772
01:04:51,965 --> 01:04:53,207
I got you.

773
01:04:53,293 --> 01:04:56,495
I cannot believe this, frickin'
New York Mets! Total losers!

774
01:04:57,652 --> 01:04:59,674
It's a rough time to be a Mets fan.

775
01:04:59,675 --> 01:05:02,832
Tell me about it,
never gonna catch the Cubs.

776
01:05:02,894 --> 01:05:05,423
Funny, the Mets actually
win it all this year.

777
01:05:05,703 --> 01:05:08,470
- Oh, yeah.
- No, I'm serious.

778
01:05:08,471 --> 01:05:09,135
I'm sure.

779
01:05:09,136 --> 01:05:12,822
Hey, look, three months from now,
your buddies down there gonna be callin' 'em the

780
01:05:12,823 --> 01:05:15,995
"Amazing Mets" and the "Miracle Mets".

781
01:05:18,701 --> 01:05:19,737
What?

782
01:05:20,462 --> 01:05:21,882
Whatchya got there, Hoss?

783
01:05:23,191 --> 01:05:27,706
The Arcanan said: "It's amazing,
it's a miracle, I'll see you at the Game."

784
01:05:28,748 --> 01:05:32,740
- I know where he is.
- Told you to trust the pie.

785
01:05:37,263 --> 01:05:40,482
If Griffin's here for a game
he's either too early or too late.

786
01:05:40,545 --> 01:05:43,714
He's here, just gotta find 'im
before Boris does.

787
01:05:52,103 --> 01:05:54,633
It's time to give your
things back, Partner.

788
01:05:54,767 --> 01:05:57,539
Aw, see, you get some pie
in ya and you get all mooshy.

789
01:05:57,540 --> 01:05:59,503
Just tired of carryin' all your stuff.

790
01:06:00,104 --> 01:06:07,665
...go, c'mon, c'mon now, all right. Let's go, Mets!
Let's go, Mets! Let's go, Mets!

791
01:06:07,978 --> 01:06:09,538
- Let's go, Mets!
- Griffin.

792
01:06:09,570 --> 01:06:15,316
Who? You're just in time, unless this
is the one where Robinson

793
01:06:15,317 --> 01:06:18,195
bad-hops it past third,
it's almost over.

794
01:06:19,957 --> 01:06:23,424
- We missin' somethin'?
- The Game.

795
01:06:51,931 --> 01:06:57,740
- This is how you see things, this is amazing.
- It's a gigantic pain in the ass.

796
01:06:57,741 --> 01:06:59,483
But it has its moments.

797
01:06:59,686 --> 01:07:01,922
This Game doesn't happen 'til October.

798
01:07:01,923 --> 01:07:04,505
It's always October, November, March.

799
01:07:05,306 --> 01:07:06,874
So many futures, and they're all real,

800
01:07:06,875 --> 01:07:10,021
just don't know which one will coalesce,
until then, they're all happening,

801
01:07:10,022 --> 01:07:13,282
like this one, it's my Favorite
Moment in Human History.

802
01:07:13,383 --> 01:07:14,875
All things that had to converge

803
01:07:14,876 --> 01:07:17,493
for the Mets to win the World Series,
they were in last place

804
01:07:17,494 --> 01:07:20,035
every single seasons
until they won it all.

805
01:07:20,036 --> 01:07:22,498
- You said you had a gift for us.
- That baseball, for instance,

806
01:07:22,499 --> 01:07:25,495
thrown for the last out of
game five manufactured in 1962

807
01:07:25,496 --> 01:07:28,026
by the Spalding Factory
of Chicopee, Massachusetts

808
01:07:28,427 --> 01:07:30,250
was aerodynamically flawed

809
01:07:30,251 --> 01:07:31,889
due to the horse hide
being improperly tanned,

810
01:07:31,890 --> 01:07:36,643
because Sheila, the tanner's wife,
left him for a Puerto Rican golf pro that Sunday.

811
01:07:36,696 --> 01:07:40,428
- Gift?
- Oh, oh, oh, yes, of course, in the box.

812
01:07:44,626 --> 01:07:48,914
It... it... it's the surprise, to protect
the Earth, it's the shield.

813
01:07:53,326 --> 01:07:58,419
Shield... Arcanan... ArcNet,
that what you did, you put up the ArcNet.

814
01:07:58,420 --> 01:07:58,932
How did I do that?

815
01:07:58,933 --> 01:08:02,363
When the ball is pitched to Davey Johnson,
who only became a baseball player

816
01:08:02,364 --> 01:08:03,552
because his father couldn't find

817
01:08:03,553 --> 01:08:06,033
a football to give him
for his 8th birthday...

818
01:08:06,034 --> 01:08:12,518
it hits his bat two micrometers too high causing him
to pop-out to Cleon Jones, who woulda been born Clara,

819
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:18,103
a statistical typist, if your parents didn't have an
extra glass of wine that night before going to bed.

820
01:08:20,613 --> 01:08:24,094
The miracle is what seems impossible,
but happens anyway.

821
01:08:33,453 --> 01:08:34,958
I lost my planet.

822
01:08:35,159 --> 01:08:37,211
I don't want you to lose yours.

823
01:08:37,678 --> 01:08:39,658
It'll take a miracle,
but if you pull this off,

824
01:08:40,359 --> 01:08:43,711
you'll be my new Favorite Moment
in Human History.

825
01:08:43,756 --> 01:08:46,151
Oh, dear.

826
01:08:46,152 --> 01:08:48,297
I forgot to see this one coming.

827
01:08:55,273 --> 01:08:56,504
Damn.

828
01:09:06,390 --> 01:09:08,846
- You have these in the future?
- No!

829
01:09:08,892 --> 01:09:09,908
Get on!

830
01:09:13,906 --> 01:09:17,202
Keep gyro settings to zero gain, balance-pitch,
and yaw with short bursts on the

831
01:09:17,203 --> 01:09:19,410
center stop between 80 and 100 PSI.

832
01:09:20,989 --> 01:09:23,236
I didn't understand any of that.

833
01:09:23,237 --> 01:09:25,610
- Gyro is zero gain!
- It is!

834
01:09:25,611 --> 01:09:28,132
Pitch and yaw with short bursts
on the center stop.

835
01:09:28,133 --> 01:09:28,627
I did it.

836
01:09:28,628 --> 01:09:30,960
Between 80 and 100 PSI.

837
01:09:32,106 --> 01:09:33,144
Got it.

838
01:09:35,421 --> 01:09:37,186
<i>The ArcNet, give it to me!</i>

839
01:09:37,187 --> 01:09:39,639
<i>I do not think is the
one where you get it now.</i>

840
01:09:39,838 --> 01:09:43,582
- You all right there, Chief?
-   Hell yeah! It'd be better with four wheels.

841
01:09:43,583 --> 01:09:45,503
Two is like my minimum!

842
01:09:51,972 --> 01:09:54,119
What happens if Boris gets the ArcNet?

843
01:09:54,120 --> 01:09:57,264
<i>Bogladyte invasion,
total destruction of Earth.</i>

844
01:10:20,963 --> 01:10:22,972
The box.

845
01:10:34,207 --> 01:10:35,684
Good boy.

846
01:10:35,685 --> 01:10:37,213
You gotta stop this guy.

847
01:10:39,323 --> 01:10:41,943
<i>I've been tryin',
you haven't been tryin'?</i>

848
01:10:42,426 --> 01:10:46,616
Hey, Slick, in the future
we ever do the "Texas Two Step"?

849
01:10:46,717 --> 01:10:48,214
Yes, Sir.

850
01:11:13,780 --> 01:11:16,152
- Did you get 'im?
- Give me a sec.

851
01:11:20,866 --> 01:11:23,219
- Is he dead?
- Negative.

852
01:11:24,467 --> 01:11:25,854
<i>He got away.</i>

853
01:11:28,037 --> 01:11:30,239
Well, I got Griffin,
let's get outta here.

854
01:11:44,873 --> 01:11:47,497
I feel younger already.

855
01:11:47,977 --> 01:11:50,720
July 16, 1969, 3:06

856
01:12:12,558 --> 01:12:16,700
You pathetic waste of Bogladyte flesh.

857
01:12:16,701 --> 01:12:20,132
I'd kill you right now
if didn't value my own life.

858
01:12:20,133 --> 01:12:21,363
Who are you?

859
01:12:21,464 --> 01:12:24,060
Look at you.
Every mistake I've ever made,

860
01:12:24,061 --> 01:12:26,872
- just waiting to happen.
- What happened to my arm?

861
01:12:26,873 --> 01:12:31,098
- You lose it, shot off by a human.
- No human can defeat me.

862
01:12:31,099 --> 01:12:33,901
You spend the next
40 years in prison,

863
01:12:33,902 --> 01:12:35,451
chained-up like an animal.

864
01:12:35,452 --> 01:12:39,583
- No prison can hold me.
- They built one especially for us...

865
01:12:39,584 --> 01:12:40,264
on the moon.

866
01:12:40,265 --> 01:12:45,125
No human has been to the moon,
so they cannot have built it there already.

867
01:12:45,126 --> 01:12:48,538
Stop arguing, you can avoid
all of this if you just listen to me.

868
01:12:48,539 --> 01:12:54,729
You were defeated, you let it get shot off,
that wasn't me, that was you.

869
01:13:00,238 --> 01:13:04,094
- What's your plan?
- Prevent the ArcNet from being deployed,

870
01:13:04,095 --> 01:13:08,216
- kill anyone who tries.
- Good plan, didn't work.

871
01:13:08,217 --> 01:13:14,787
With my help we'll get the ArcNet,
kill Agent K, the invasion will be successful,

872
01:13:14,788 --> 01:13:18,851
and we'll get to keep both of our arms.

873
01:13:18,852 --> 01:13:20,705
Stop staring at it!

874
01:13:21,643 --> 01:13:22,720
Listen.

875
01:13:38,267 --> 01:13:41,488
- You all right?
- Oh, thank you for saving my life.

876
01:13:41,489 --> 01:13:43,014
It's what we do.

877
01:13:43,596 --> 01:13:45,185
You still have the ArcNet?

878
01:13:47,272 --> 01:13:51,690
When you're being hunted by Boris the Animal,
you get good at hiding things.

879
01:14:16,414 --> 01:14:18,693
This will save your world.

880
01:14:21,858 --> 01:14:24,854
Once it's outside the atmosphere
it gets a whole lot bigger.

881
01:14:26,433 --> 01:14:28,070
All you have to do is to play it.

882
01:14:29,171 --> 01:14:32,577
You mean in space?
Well, how to you suppose we do that?

883
01:14:32,878 --> 01:14:35,779
Ah, it's just one small step.

884
01:14:47,251 --> 01:14:49,789
MOON LAUNCH TODAY

885
01:14:49,990 --> 01:14:51,691
Moon launch.

886
01:14:54,623 --> 01:14:56,084
Cape Canaveral!

887
01:14:57,585 --> 01:15:00,069
July 16, 1969.

888
01:15:00,770 --> 01:15:02,615
We got 6 hours t'get to Florida.

889
01:15:02,616 --> 01:15:05,710
- Better get a move-on, Slick!
- Wait! Hold up!

890
01:15:05,711 --> 01:15:07,798
Not us, I'm gonna do this one alone.

891
01:15:07,799 --> 01:15:10,096
No, he has to be the one that...

892
01:15:10,097 --> 01:15:11,336
What do you mean "alone."?

893
01:15:11,730 --> 01:15:13,779
Means I'm gonna go to Florida,
you gonna stay here,

894
01:15:13,780 --> 01:15:15,507
and I need you to trust me on this one.

895
01:15:15,645 --> 01:15:19,366
Trust you? I don't think so.
Something you not tellin' me, Slick?

896
01:15:19,367 --> 01:15:22,628
- I'm tellin' you that you're not goin' to Florida.
- Well, that ain't gonna happen, Partner.

897
01:15:22,629 --> 01:15:27,818
But, K, please...
I will not allow you to go to Florida.

898
01:15:29,657 --> 01:15:31,251
Stop me.

899
01:15:35,380 --> 01:15:36,658
You die there!

900
01:15:39,477 --> 01:15:42,474
Cape Canaveral,
Apollo launch!

901
01:15:44,306 --> 01:15:46,270
Boris kills you there.

902
01:15:48,924 --> 01:15:52,252
That's what I'm here for,
that's what I came back to stop.

903
01:15:52,253 --> 01:15:54,928
Oh, dear, we're in this one.

904
01:15:56,894 --> 01:16:00,782
K, I saw the file,
I looked at the report,

905
01:16:00,783 --> 01:16:03,472
now I know I said I've told
you everything, but you gotta...

906
01:16:03,773 --> 01:16:07,167
- That's for lyin' to me.
- Look, I'm sorry, Man!

907
01:16:09,666 --> 01:16:11,695
And that's for tellin' me the truth.

908
01:16:13,555 --> 01:16:17,040
Trying to protect you... Man!

909
01:16:19,599 --> 01:16:21,879
The bitterest truth is better
than the sweetest lie.

910
01:16:25,860 --> 01:16:27,507
He has to go to Cape Canaveral.

911
01:16:27,708 --> 01:16:30,775
He must deploy the ArcNet
as he did before.

912
01:16:30,776 --> 01:16:32,146
There's no other way.

913
01:16:32,785 --> 01:16:35,579
K is the only hope in saving Earth.

914
01:16:36,807 --> 01:16:43,236
Can I save him? Is there any
Future where I save his life?

915
01:16:45,608 --> 01:16:46,590
Yes,

916
01:16:48,791 --> 01:16:54,840
but where there is death,
there will always be death.

917
01:17:12,579 --> 01:17:15,372
Accordin' to you I've already done this
before, so we know it's possible.

918
01:17:16,072 --> 01:17:19,773
If you're half the agent you say you are,
you'll make sure I don't get killed doin' it.

919
01:17:24,778 --> 01:17:26,838
So, Partners, you tell me!

920
01:17:29,630 --> 01:17:30,815
Let's go.

921
01:17:44,281 --> 01:17:46,748
- Agent K, how are you?
- I'm good!

922
01:17:46,749 --> 01:17:49,800
Okay, group hug on the way to...
to what we're doin'.

923
01:17:50,109 --> 01:17:54,408
<i>...morning, man is about to launch
himself on a trip to the Moon,</i>

924
01:17:54,439 --> 01:17:56,869
<i>with the expectation of landing there.</i>

925
01:17:57,338 --> 01:18:01,315
Look, I gotta ask you, if we pull
this off, fix things the way they were,

926
01:18:01,392 --> 01:18:03,380
O and I, are we...

927
01:18:03,449 --> 01:18:07,430
A wise man once told me: "Do not ask questions
you don't wanna know the answer to."

928
01:18:08,930 --> 01:18:11,455
- I said that, didn't I?
- Yes, Sir.

929
01:18:16,387 --> 01:18:19,617
- Here they are.
- What are they?

930
01:18:19,681 --> 01:18:22,042
- JetPacks!
- JetPacks?

931
01:18:24,484 --> 01:18:28,700
We're... we... we're not doin' JetPacks, there's
a reason we don't have these things in the future.

932
01:18:28,701 --> 01:18:30,515
K, we gotta drive!

933
01:18:30,516 --> 01:18:33,544
Can't drive to Florida from
Manhattan in 5 hours, Chief!

934
01:18:33,545 --> 01:18:37,523
Yeah, yeah, we can! The... the Red Button,
standard issue in every MIB car,

935
01:18:37,524 --> 01:18:39,831
you press the Red Button,
goes into HyperDrive.

936
01:18:39,832 --> 01:18:42,045
No Red Buttons yet, Slick!

937
01:18:43,309 --> 01:18:45,121
Come on, Man!

938
01:18:50,729 --> 01:18:53,072
Do you even know how
to work this stupid thing?

939
01:18:53,073 --> 01:18:59,380
Like with anything, just have
t'strap yourself in and hope for the best.

940
01:19:00,348 --> 01:19:05,027
- Isn't that right, Miss O?
- Unfortunately it is.

941
01:19:16,115 --> 01:19:20,562
- You ready, Slick?
- Let's get it!

942
01:19:21,064 --> 01:19:22,998
This is gonna be interesting.

943
01:19:59,007 --> 01:20:01,780
I'm glad this isn't one
of the times we explode.

944
01:20:02,397 --> 01:20:03,859
One of the times?

945
01:20:06,698 --> 01:20:08,457
Oh, we got company.

946
01:20:12,916 --> 01:20:14,657
What the hell!?

947
01:20:16,259 --> 01:20:17,921
Is that a battery belt?

948
01:20:27,961 --> 01:20:29,628
All right, I got it!

949
01:20:32,825 --> 01:20:35,523
No, any reality that
gets the Shield deployed,

950
01:20:35,524 --> 01:20:37,477
is one where you tell the truth.

951
01:20:37,632 --> 01:20:41,615
- The truth?
- The truth is the only path.

952
01:20:41,616 --> 01:20:43,518
This is a restricted area!

953
01:20:48,396 --> 01:20:50,086
Yes, Sir, it is.

954
01:20:50,087 --> 01:20:53,606
Good day, Gentlemen.
Great day for America, isn't it?

955
01:20:53,684 --> 01:20:57,230
My name is Agent J,
this is Agent K, that's Griff.

956
01:20:57,431 --> 01:21:00,756
We're from a secret government
organization that polices and monitors

957
01:21:00,841 --> 01:21:03,621
alien activity on and off of Planet Earth.

958
01:21:04,801 --> 01:21:08,513
All right, now, here's the thing, see,
we have this special little metal thingy

959
01:21:08,514 --> 01:21:12,160
that Griff gave us that we
have t'get on top of that rocket,

960
01:21:12,566 --> 01:21:15,493
to prevent an alien invasion.

961
01:21:19,438 --> 01:21:21,594
- That worked.
- Like a charm!

962
01:21:21,595 --> 01:21:24,491
Sir, Delta gate, we might have
a problem. Three trespassers,

963
01:21:24,492 --> 01:21:28,798
no I'D.s but they got weapons, Sir...
the kind I've ever seen before.

964
01:21:37,503 --> 01:21:40,344
What breed of Dammed Fool do you have
to be try to penetrate my launch site

965
01:21:40,345 --> 01:21:42,988
on the day of the most massive
feat ever attempted by Mankind,

966
01:21:43,338 --> 01:21:47,282
watched by God, the population of
the entire Planet, my own first born?

967
01:21:47,283 --> 01:21:50,138
Colonel! Colonel, they had these.

968
01:21:50,917 --> 01:21:54,276
They said they need to put somethin'
on the rocket for an invasion.

969
01:21:58,619 --> 01:22:01,224
- Thank you.
- I got 10 minutes to launch.

970
01:22:01,225 --> 01:22:03,549
If you pose threat to
that rocket, you tell me now,

971
01:22:03,550 --> 01:22:05,484
and do not lie to me!

972
01:22:09,661 --> 01:22:11,486
I told the truth last time.

973
01:22:16,998 --> 01:22:20,331
Sir, this man came here
from the future to protect me

974
01:22:20,332 --> 01:22:23,827
so I can attach a shield to the
top of that rocket and save the world.

975
01:22:24,103 --> 01:22:25,453
Need your help t'do that!

976
01:22:29,159 --> 01:22:31,798
- Take him to the brig!
- You're slippin', Griff!

977
01:22:32,562 --> 01:22:34,478
Sir, if I may...

978
01:22:50,173 --> 01:22:55,401
Corporal, your men are no longer needed.
I'll take the prisoners.

979
01:22:55,402 --> 01:22:57,008
- Sir, you...
- Dismissed!

980
01:23:06,238 --> 01:23:07,579
Follow me.

981
01:23:14,868 --> 01:23:16,891
Hey, you did the Future thing on him,
whatchya show him?

982
01:23:16,892 --> 01:23:22,271
Only what he needed to see.
I... I... I have to go now!

983
01:23:22,661 --> 01:23:26,220
- What? No, no, no, c'mon!
- No! You don't need me anymore.

984
01:23:26,521 --> 01:23:28,536
All right, Griff, don't start flippin' on me,
I need you to...

985
01:23:28,537 --> 01:23:32,527
When Boris's arm is taken, the past
will be as it was, K will survive,

986
01:23:32,528 --> 01:23:34,617
he will not know you were ever here.

987
01:23:36,303 --> 01:23:40,213
All right, all right, I'm gone,
got it, like a reset?

988
01:23:40,214 --> 01:23:43,433
When that happens, go home, leave!

989
01:23:43,634 --> 01:23:46,756
- Hey, Slick, you comin'?
- Yo! Yeah!

990
01:23:48,980 --> 01:23:53,315
- Thanks, Man! Hey, will I ever see you again?
- Anything's possible.

991
01:23:56,049 --> 01:23:57,216
Griff!

992
01:24:03,754 --> 01:24:06,345
I can never bear to watch this part.

993
01:24:08,230 --> 01:24:14,225
<i>Armstrong and Aldrin are scheduled to
set foot on the Moon on early Monday morning,</i>

994
01:24:14,302 --> 01:24:15,920
<i>Eastern Daylight Time.</i>

995
01:24:17,566 --> 01:24:20,163
- Where's Griffin?
- Doin' his own thing.

996
01:24:42,860 --> 01:24:43,818
Gentlemen!

997
01:24:47,685 --> 01:24:51,858
This elevator will take you to the top.
To get the ArcNet outside the atmosphere

998
01:24:51,859 --> 01:24:55,610
you need to strap it to
the escape rocket above the capsule.

999
01:24:55,611 --> 01:24:58,606
You do not want to be anywhere near this
rocket when it takes off.

1000
01:24:59,230 --> 01:25:01,616
- Questions?
- No, thank you for this, Colonel.

1001
01:25:01,952 --> 01:25:04,927
- Some job ya got there.
- Thanks, thanks a lot, Bro.

1002
01:25:05,428 --> 01:25:09,401
- What did Griff show you back there?
- He showed me how important you are.

1003
01:25:09,427 --> 01:25:11,008
You and your partner.

1004
01:25:19,350 --> 01:25:21,750
Hey, look, if everything goes
right the way we hope it does,

1005
01:25:21,751 --> 01:25:24,618
I'm gonna probably end up
havin' to get outta pretty quick,

1006
01:25:24,619 --> 01:25:27,884
so I'm not gonna have a chance
to say our proper good-byes.

1007
01:25:28,510 --> 01:25:31,958
If things go wrong,
you're not gonna have a chance to, either.

1008
01:25:33,931 --> 01:25:36,421
I guess win or lose this is it.

1009
01:25:39,993 --> 01:25:42,006
I see why I recruited you.

1010
01:25:44,640 --> 01:25:46,153
You a good man.

1011
01:25:49,488 --> 01:25:50,788
Good man.

1012
01:25:53,439 --> 01:25:58,683
- Man, what the hell happened to you?
- Told ya, it still hasn't happened yet.

1013
01:26:03,516 --> 01:26:05,441
<i>I'll take this one!</i>

1014
01:26:05,442 --> 01:26:06,404
Naughty!

1015
01:26:09,211 --> 01:26:11,892
You might want to get a
pedicure if you get a second.

1016
01:26:21,205 --> 01:26:23,223
...and lift off.

1017
01:27:04,990 --> 01:27:08,244
<i>...just past the 2 minute mark
in the countdown, and all is still go.</i>

1018
01:27:08,285 --> 01:27:10,313
<i>...monitor our status board.</i>

1019
01:27:31,416 --> 01:27:35,007
<i> Astronauts report it feels good,
power transfer is complete,</i>

1020
01:27:35,008 --> 01:27:38,158
<i> Neil Armstrong just reported back
it's been a real smooth countdown.</i>

1021
01:27:50,779 --> 01:27:54,653
Hey, Boris, could you
give me a hand? Hey!!

1022
01:28:00,198 --> 01:28:03,870
Dawg! You hear me callin' you?

1023
01:28:04,671 --> 01:28:09,145
Boris the Animal! Hey, Boris the Animal!

1024
01:28:11,298 --> 01:28:13,666
It's just Boris!

1025
01:28:17,428 --> 01:28:21,467
- You're gonna lose!
- Let's agree to disagree.

1026
01:28:40,158 --> 01:28:43,697
Heeey!!! Boris the Animal!

1027
01:29:03,766 --> 01:29:06,217
July 16, 1969, 9:30

1028
01:29:07,971 --> 01:29:09,848
July 16, 1969, 9:31

1029
01:29:21,199 --> 01:29:22,779
July 16, 1969, 9:30

1030
01:29:24,027 --> 01:29:28,334
- You're gonna lose!
- Let's agree to disagree.

1031
01:29:37,346 --> 01:29:40,902
Hey! Boris the Animal!

1032
01:29:55,667 --> 01:30:00,404
- That's not possible!
- Let's agree to disagree.

1033
01:30:05,513 --> 01:30:07,736
That's not possible!

1034
01:30:17,332 --> 01:30:18,600
K!

1035
01:30:19,841 --> 01:30:22,947
I win! I'm better than me!

1036
01:30:29,971 --> 01:30:31,049
That's my partner!

1037
01:30:31,250 --> 01:30:32,812
<i>That's my partner!!</i>

1038
01:30:39,636 --> 01:30:43,591
- If we call this in, they'll scrub the launch.
- I didn't see anything.

1039
01:31:18,274 --> 01:31:20,205
- Where's your partner?
- He's fine, he went home!

1040
01:31:20,206 --> 01:31:21,874
- How's that work?
- Got me!

1041
01:31:21,875 --> 01:31:22,954
Come on!

1042
01:31:38,081 --> 01:31:39,514
Get down!

1043
01:32:10,004 --> 01:32:15,032
- Bingo!
- Man, that is some next-level stuff.

1044
01:32:24,383 --> 01:32:27,771
If you ever want t'see more,
I know a top-secret organization that can

1045
01:32:27,772 --> 01:32:32,768
- use a man like you.
- I wish I could.

1046
01:32:33,655 --> 01:32:36,883
- Thank you.
- See ya 'round, K!

1047
01:32:38,853 --> 01:32:40,380
Look out!!

1048
01:32:44,745 --> 01:32:49,042
Go ahead, arrest me!

1049
01:32:49,787 --> 01:32:51,391
Not this time.

1050
01:33:01,386 --> 01:33:04,526
"Where there's death,
there will always be death."

1051
01:33:14,011 --> 01:33:16,541
Daddy, daddy!

1052
01:33:21,009 --> 01:33:25,361
Hey! Hey! My name's K, what's your name?

1053
01:33:25,524 --> 01:33:29,093
- James.
- James, it's a nice name.

1054
01:33:29,481 --> 01:33:31,731
Where's my daddy?

1055
01:33:33,660 --> 01:33:35,833
Whadya got there, what is that?

1056
01:33:35,903 --> 01:33:39,482
My dad gave it to me,
it's t'watch the launch.

1057
01:33:46,674 --> 01:33:48,203
Where is my daddy?

1058
01:33:54,566 --> 01:33:58,267
He went to go do something...
very special.

1059
01:33:58,703 --> 01:34:05,443
And he wanted me... to... stay here,
and take care of his best pal.

1060
01:34:09,786 --> 01:34:12,264
When's he gonna be back?

1061
01:34:13,175 --> 01:34:14,378
He, uh...

1062
01:34:29,431 --> 01:34:36,862
James, if you look right here, I will tell
you the only thing you ever have to know.

1063
01:34:42,634 --> 01:34:46,968
- Your daddy is a hero!
- My daddy is a hero?

1064
01:34:50,540 --> 01:34:52,927
- You wanna take a walk with me?
- Yes.

1065
01:35:03,345 --> 01:35:04,424
James!

1066
01:35:46,971 --> 01:35:47,847
You're late.

1067
01:35:48,811 --> 01:35:50,496
Uh... sorry, lost track of time.

1068
01:35:53,276 --> 01:35:54,492
How do you know that song?

1069
01:35:54,530 --> 01:35:56,279
Drink your coffee,
we got work to do!

1070
01:35:57,645 --> 01:36:01,169
- What do you know and what do you don't know?
- How the hell do I know what I don't know?

1071
01:36:01,248 --> 01:36:02,420
That's a really good question.

1072
01:36:02,421 --> 01:36:04,978
- Did we got to Wu's last night?
- Yeah.

1073
01:36:05,572 --> 01:36:07,507
-Bogladytes?
- Been extinct for 40 years.

1074
01:36:07,508 --> 01:36:10,278
Perfect.
Did we talk on the phone last night?

1075
01:36:10,279 --> 01:36:13,025
- You hung-up on me.
- Yeah, I did.

1076
01:36:14,478 --> 01:36:19,254
That was because of all of those secrets
the Universe doesn't know about.

1077
01:36:24,920 --> 01:36:32,806
But I realized that last night was
a long, long time ago.

1078
01:36:37,362 --> 01:36:42,480
- And, really, I just wanna say thank you.
- It's been my privilege.

1079
01:36:52,434 --> 01:36:57,708
You know, there's a really high possibility now,
that I might know some things you don't know.

1080
01:36:57,709 --> 01:36:59,253
I doubt it.

1081
01:36:59,611 --> 01:37:01,453
Hey, I bet I know what
went-down wit' you and you and O.

1082
01:37:01,454 --> 01:37:05,229
She's a very fine lady, but you know the rules:
there's no fraternizin' amongst agents.

1083
01:37:05,230 --> 01:37:08,613
Well, I think ya'll mighta
fraternized a time or two.

1084
01:37:11,935 --> 01:37:14,617
This is New Favorite Moment
in Human History,

1085
01:37:15,482 --> 01:37:18,363
unless this is the one where
K forgot to leave the tip.

1086
01:37:33,400 --> 01:37:34,481
I almost forgot.

1087
01:37:43,751 --> 01:37:45,087
That was a close one.

1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:02,794
Testing, testing. One, two, three.

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:04,193
Is it working, Kev?

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:06,515
# Stick it up, mister!

4
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:08,994
54-46 Was My Number

5
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:11,395
# Hear what I say, sir, yeah

6
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:13,959
# No, no, no, no, no

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:14,955
# Yeah

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,116
# Get your hands in the air, sir!

9
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:21,195
# Woo-hoo, yeah

10
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,800
# And you will get no hurt, mister

11
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,239
# No, no, no

12
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:28,352
# I said, yeah
# I said, yeah

13
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,278
# What did I say?
# What did I say?

14
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:34,312
# Don't you hear? I said, yeah
# Yeah, yeah

15
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:37,511
# Listen to what I say
# To what I say

16
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:40,632
# Do you believe I would take something
with me

17
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:43,914
# And give it to the policeman?

18
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:46,155
# I wouldn't do that

19
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:48,912
# And if I do that, I would say

20
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,191
# Sir, come on
and put the charge on me

21
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:55,151
# I wouldn't do that

22
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:57,077
# No, I wouldn't do that

23
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:58,995
# Huh

24
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:01,270
# I'm not a fool to hurt myself

25
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:05,271
# So I was innocent of what they done to me

26
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:06,833
# They was wrong

27
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:10,077
# Ah, listen to me one more time,
they were wrong, huh

28
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,269
# Oh, yeah

29
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:13,231
# Give it to me one time

30
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,235
# Huh

31
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,430
# Give it to me two time

32
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:17,595
# Huh, huh

33
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,471
# Give it to me three time, yeah

34
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:20,669
# Huh, huh, huh

35
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,517
# Give it to me four time

36
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:23,788
# Huh, huh, huh, huh

37
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:28,197
# 54-46 was my number

38
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,719
# Oh, yeah

39
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:34,117
# Right now, someone has that number

40
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,957
# One more time, baby

41
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,514
# 54-46

42
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,358
# Was my number
# Was my number

43
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:45,996
# Right now,
someone has got that number

44
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,268
# All right

45
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:49,709
# I said, yeah
# I said, yeah

46
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:52,752
# Listen to what I say
# Listen to what I say

47
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:56,031
# Oh, I said, hear me now
# Yeah, yeah

# Listen to what I say

49
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,593
# Oh, give it to me one time

50
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:23,595
# Huh

00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,596
# Give it to me two time

52
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:26,868
# Huh, huh

53
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,876
# Give it, give it, give it, give it, give it,

54
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,558
# Give it, give it, give it, give it

55
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,113
# No, no, no, no

56
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,519
# Whoa

57
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:05,034
# 54-46

58
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:08,311
# Was my number
# Was my number

59
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:12,751
# Right now,
someone has got that number

60
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,789
# All right

61
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,752
# I said, yeah
# I said, yeah

63
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,752
# Oh, I said hear me now
# Yeah, yeah...

64
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,274
<i>...they think it's attractive</i>

65
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,276
<i>to offer to the young</i>

66
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:47,189
<i>a future wholly controlled
by the operation of the socialist state...</i>

67
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,990
...two days for me, I think.
- Next Tuesday?

68
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,189
Yeah.

69
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:46,155
Wa-hey, nice flares, matey!

70
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,553
Piss off.

71
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:05,072
- Are you gonna buy that?
- Yeah. Yeah, one sec, mate.

72
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,678
Come on. Bring it over.

73
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,111
Just give me a minute.

74
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,118
I'll just check...

75
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,470
- It's not a library, you know.
- I was fricking reading that.

76
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,512
- You what?
- I said, I was fricking reading it.

77
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,118
- Just go.
- What?

78
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,513
Just go.

79
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,118
What about my Cola Cubes?

80
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,310
You're not gonna get any.
Now, just go, all right?

81
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,588
Cola Cubes.

82
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:33,108
I know who you are
and I know your mum. Go. Now.

83
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,878
- Cola Cubes.
- Are you gonna go or not?

84
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:37,229
- No.
- Right, OK, I'll call the police.

85
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,510
- Go on, then.
- I mean it, I'm gonna call 'em.

86
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,835
- Go on, then.
- I mean it.

87
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:44,314
- Go on, then.
- We'll see.

88
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,918
All right. I'm going.

89
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,757
Oh, and you're banned.

90
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,791
Oh, and you're a mong.

91
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,113
Hey, see you, Janice!

92
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,398
Oh, God, what a loser.

93
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,597
Loser!

94
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,839
- Look at that twat.
- There?

95
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:21,990
Fucking hell, look at them flares. Goof!

96
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,350
Goofy.

97
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,550
Oi, oi.

98
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,919
Talking to me?

99
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:28,915
What?

100
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,518
Never knew Keith Chegwin had a son.

101
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,913
Piss off.

102
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:35,111
- What the fuck are they?
- These? I'm wearing 'em for a bet.

103
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,230
- What's your excuse?
- Cheeky bastard.

104
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,191
- Woodstock's that way, pal.
- Fuck off.

105
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,231
At least I don't look like Count Dracula.

106
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:44,511
- Think you're funny, you little spaz?
- Yeah. Yeah.

107
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,915
- Wanna hear a fucking joke, yeah?
- Yeah, go on, then.

108
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,791
How many people can you fit in a Mini?

109
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,193
I don't fucking know.

110
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,958
Three in the back, two in the front

111
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,831
and your fucking dad in the ashtray.

112
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,518
You fucker!

113
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,596
Fight, fight, fight, fight!

114
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:06,074
- I'll fucking murder you.
- Get off!

115
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,073
- You fucking...
- Get up!

116
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,473
- Fucking...
- Shut up!

117
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,193
You fucking bastard.
What the fuck are you bothered about?

118
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,593
You fucking...

119
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:18,712
Do not use that language.
Headmaster's office now.

120
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,194
I'm fed up with you.

121
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,719
Argh.

122
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,913
Aargh!

123
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,313
Argh!

124
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:48,110
There's a disco today, Harvey.

125
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,798
But you won't be going.

126
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,239
Now get out!

127
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,633
Come in, Field.

128
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,952
Tainted Love

129
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:12,117
# For I toss and turn
I can't sleep at night...

130
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:23,350
# This tainted love you've given
I give you all a boy...

131
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,913
it's gotta be smoother.

132
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,871
- Make it smooth.
- That's nice.

133
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,638
That were nice. Oh, yeah.

134
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:31,558
- Now we got a rhythm going.
- Piss off. I just wanna light my fag.

135
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,033
For God's sake.

136
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,953
- All right, mate?
- All right.

137
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,718
'Ey up, what's the matter?

138
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:38,715
Nothing.

139
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:42,070
What's with t'face ache?
You look upset. What's to do?

140
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:44,429
It's people picking on me,
taking the mick out of me.

141
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,313
Oh, mate, you're breaking my heart.
Sit down for five minutes.

142
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,271
- Why?
- Woody, look at them flares.

143
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,788
See what I mean?
That's what I fucking mean, there.

144
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:54,991
You can see he's upset.
Will you behave with the flare comments?

145
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,951
- They're bad...
- Come on. Five minutes.

146
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,878
- Just come and sit down, mate.
- But you'll all just pick on me.

147
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,354
- Everyone does.
- Oh, come and sit down, mate.

148
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,834
I feel bloody sorry for you.
Just five minutes.

149
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,269
Just give me five minutes
to make you feel better.

150
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:10,517
Come on, mate. Bloody hell!
It can't be that bad, eh?

151
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,755
So what's this?
Who's picking on you, lad?

152
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,631
Some lad at school.

153
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,069
- What's his name?
- Harvey.

154
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,075
Harvey?

155
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,108
What sort of a bloody girl's name
is Harvey?

156
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:26,357
Hello. I'm Harvey.
And I've come to give you gyp.

157
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,669
I've got one of these for you,
Sonny Jim.

158
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:32,712
I've got one of those for you.
My name is Harvey.

159
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,955
You're drawing a fine line.

160
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,911
You're drawing a fine line. Eh?

161
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,234
Bloody hell!

162
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,668
- Where the frig have you been?
- Bloody Ada!

163
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,790
Took me an hour
to get someone to go in for me.

164
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:47,752
You had to wait a bloody hour for that pie?
Give me that shit.

165
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,119
For God's sake.

166
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:51,549
- Who the fuck's he?
- What is your name?

167
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,033
I'm Shaun.

168
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,991
Shaun, I'm Woody, mate.
Nice to meet you.

169
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,712
That there's Milky, my main man.

170
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,830
Pukey's a nutcase. Don't wind him up.

171
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,711
That's Kez. He's pretty chilled out.

172
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:04,196
And this fat idiot's Gadget.

173
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,472
You are, Gadget, you are.

174
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,670
Anyway, Shaun, move.
You're in my seat.

175
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:10,869
What?

176
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:12,114
Move.

177
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:15,038
Gadget, mate, out of all the places to sit,
you want to sit there?

178
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,638
- Yeah, I do.
Shall I move?

179
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:19,035
What are you asking him for?
Move, now.

180
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:21,719
- He don't have to bloody move.
- Fucking does. Get out.

181
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,797
Oi, it's a free country.
You sit there if you want to sit there.

182
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:27,308
- Have you seen these?
- Woody, tell him.

183
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,839
Woody, tell 'em.

184
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,199
Get the fuck...

185
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,639
Calm down.

186
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,557
Will you just calm down?

187
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,955
Fucking behave.
You need to learn when to chill out.

188
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:36,989
What...?

189
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,758
Get the fuck out of my seat now!

190
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,792
Out of this tunnel
or I'll make your life a living fucking hell.

191
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,558
- Fuck off!
- Fuck out!

192
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,070
- You're a pain in my arse.
- You're all a bunch of bastards!

193
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,553
Oh, fuck off!

194
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:51,239
You prick!
Shaun, come back, mate.

195
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,918
- Sit down.
- Oh, bloody hell.

196
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,518
Shaun! Sh...

197
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,790
Oh, I feel bad. I feel bad now.

198
00:10:56,840 --> 00:11:00,515
Well done, well done. Are you happy with
your fucking pie now, you prick?

199
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,949
You're a frigging bully, Gadget.

200
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:10,271
<i>see what you can do with this.</i>

201
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,595
<i>What C is a fodder plant...</i>

202
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:17,278
- Hiya, love.
- Hello.

203
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,118
- You all right?
- Yeah.

204
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,276
Had a good day at school?

205
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,195
Shaun?

206
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,476
What's wrong, love?
Shaun, come here.

207
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:32,475
What?

208
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:34,431
Sit down.
I want to have a word with you.

209
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,629
Why?

210
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,591
Please, son, I want to talk to you.

211
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,108
What?

212
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,276
What have you done to your face?

213
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,514
Nothing.

214
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:47,109
You've got all scratches all over your face.
Have you been fighting?

215
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:49,116
No, I did it on the way home from school.

216
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:52,357
You didn't. You're lying to me.
How have you done it?

217
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,478
It was a boy at school.

218
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,835
He made a joke about Dad, so I hit him.

219
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,552
Well, what did he say about Dad?

220
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,636
I don't wanna say it, Mum.
It's disgusting.

221
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,557
Shaun, I want to know what he said.

222
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:07,797
I've been picked on three times today.

223
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:10,149
All because of my trousers.

224
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,838
What's wrong with your trousers?

225
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,791
Look at the fucking size of them!

226
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:16,308
Stop swearing.
There's nothing wrong with them.

227
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,999
- Your dad bought you them.
- They're too big for me!

228
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:22,271
If you didn't want to wear them,
you should have put your school ones on.

229
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,788
It's non-uniform day, Mum.

230
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:27,354
What do you want me to do, Shaun?
I don't know what to do.

231
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:30,670
- We could move away.
- We can't move away.

232
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,951
We're not moving from anywhere.
We live here and we're staying here.

233
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,718
I don't like it here, Mum.

234
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:39,752
I liked it better when we were with Dad.

235
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:46,236
Well, I liked it better when we was with Dad,
but Dad's gone now.

236
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,275
Yes!

237
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:02,190
<i>Mrs Thatcher's visiting The Antrim</i>

238
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:05,118
<i>very close to two key events
in the War, for the ship.</i>

239
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,957
<i>Just over there,
in the Falklands Sound,</i>

240
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,118
<i>she was hit aft by a 1,000lb bomb,
which, fortunately, didn't explode,</i>

241
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,071
<i>and there, on Fanning Head,</i>

242
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:18,830
<i>heavy bombardment from The Antrim
took out a key Argentine position.</i>

243
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:22,953
<i>Like the Army, the Navy is still taking
the threat of another Argentine attack</i>

244
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,353
<i>very seriously...</i>

245
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,798
<i>...as well as these Oerlikon guns,
the destroyer is armed...</i>

246
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,073
<i>...sea slug, sea cat...</i>

247
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,158
What the fuck?

248
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:55,997
What do you want, Gadget?
You've just nearly put my window through.

249
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:58,952
Woody wants to know
if you're coming hunting.

250
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,798
Hunting? Why?

251
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:04,832
Because he feels sorry
for what happened the other day.

252
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,348
And he just wants to know
if you're coming out.

253
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:10,870
If I come, you're just gonna kick my head in
in the middle of a field.

254
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:14,833
Woody said if I come within five feet of you,
he's gonna kick the shit out of me.

255
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,314
And why on earth
are you dressed like that?

256
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,157
We always dress like this.

257
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,792
You look stupid.

258
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,230
I know, but it's just a laugh that we have.

259
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:26,350
I've got you some stuff. Come on.

260
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:29,597
It's not a trick, is it, Gadget?
Woody really wants me to come?

261
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:31,995
It's no trick, honest. Please?

262
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:34,554
- All right. I'll be down in a minute.
- Hurry up!

263
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:38,189
<i>Hurry up, you.
Give me a hand.</i>

264
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,151
- Fuck it.
- Come on, Tubs!

265
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,873
Hurry up,
cos Gadget won't get over it, will he?

266
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,751
- Come on.
- Come on. Get up.

267
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,189
Here you are.
Gadget, have that. Have this.

268
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,151
- Gadget!
- Gadget, have this.

269
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,918
I'll have that there, mate.

270
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,439
No, I'm all right.

271
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:59,391
- Oh, man. Woo!
- I wanted that!

272
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,510
Woo! Woo! Woo-oo!

273
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:02,879
Come on!

274
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:07,593
- Where are you going, Gadge?
Whoa-oa-oah!

275
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,073
Woo!

276
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:10,633
Woo-hoo! Woo!

277
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:13,353
Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

278
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:26,356
Fuck, yeah! Fucking do it!

279
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,594
Woo!

280
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:29,913
Woody!

281
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,870
Go on! Fucking do it!

282
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,239
Do it again and again!

283
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:36,350
- You fucking daft bastard.
- You fat bastard.

284
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:44,948
Go on!

285
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:46,875
Hey!

286
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,752
Fucking do it! Do it!

287
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,711
Aah!

288
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,079
Shaun!

289
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:59,872
Aah!

290
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,279
Come on!

291
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,880
Come on, Shauny! Come on, Shaun!

292
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,433
Come on, Shaun!

293
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,758
Where are we going?

294
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,711
I'll get you a good seat.

295
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,113
Woo!

296
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:15,996
Get up them stairs.

297
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,835
Shaun! Shaun, Shaun, Shaun!

298
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,233
Quick!

299
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,876
Come on. Quickly. Quickly. Ssh!

300
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,509
Where the fuck have yous gone?
Come on.

301
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:43,471
I can't be doing with this, lads.

302
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,431
I'm not in the mood for this.

303
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:48,237
I know yous are in here, I'm not stupid.

304
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:49,793
So, come out.

305
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,393
Fucker!

306
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:59,553
Classical!

307
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:00,874
Classical.

308
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:03,718
- Classic.
Classic. Classic.

309
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,910
Gold, mate. Liquid gold. Brilliant.

310
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:08,428
That was classic! Classic, classic.

311
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:12,234
Oi, oi, oi!
What's all that about, dickhead, eh?

312
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:14,077
What's the deal with you, eh?

313
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:16,236
- He shot me.
- I shot you as well.

314
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,395
Come on, Shauny.

315
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,510
- Bloody hell, Gadget.
- What d'you do that for?

316
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:21,994
Look how yous
have been treating me all day.

317
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,758
I had to carry all the bags.

318
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:26,268
All of yous running off on me,
hiding on me.

319
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:29,471
Listen to me. He's a young lad.
He's had a fucking bad week.

320
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:32,398
So, we're bringing him with us
to show him a bloody good time

321
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:34,556
and you just backhanded him
round t'head.

322
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,158
I'm disappointed, mate.

323
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:38,316
You're all favouritising him.

324
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:41,238
I feel like I've gone down in the ranks
since he's come.

325
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,713
What ranks?

326
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:45,433
I'm sorry if I've took your place, mate.
I really am.

327
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:48,916
And if you really want me to go
and give you your spot back, I'll just go.

328
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,871
Don't, mate. Please.

329
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:53,036
- I'll go. He don't like me.
- No, don't.

330
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:54,991
He don't know what he's saying.

331
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:58,874
It's not that I don't like you, mate.
I think you're great. It's just...

332
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:00,831
I'm having a shitty time and...

333
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,792
- Come on. Shake hands.
- I've been where you are and...

334
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:07,515
Less of this. It's nonsense, this.
We're mates here. Shake his hand.

335
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:10,597
Come on. Good lad.
That's what I'm all about. Yeah.

336
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,393
Come here, come here.
Give us a bloody hug, come on.

337
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:16,398
Bloody hell. Come on, all of yous.
All of yous, get in here.

338
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,829
Bloody hell, my arse!
Who's that on my arse?

339
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,791
Who's that? Calm it down.

340
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:22,558
Bloody hell, Gadge. Come on, mate.

341
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,875
Morning Sun

342
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:28,071
# Way out in the morning sun

343
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,758
# There lies my baby,
she was waiting so long

344
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,313
# Aah aah-aah-aah

345
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:36,432
# Oh, she sing for the sweet melody

346
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,635
# Oh, Lord, I could hear the harmony

347
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:42,399
# Aah-aah-aah-aah aah-aah-aah...

348
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,351
Wait for me, love.

349
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,878
- I'll see you, chicken.
- See ya.

350
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,069
Them.

351
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,998
- Which ones?
- The big red ones.

352
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:56,271
Oh, you're not having them, sweetheart.
Look at the size of 'em.

353
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,231
Oh, come on, Mum. You said.

354
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:00,874
No, Shaun, they look like thug boots.
They're awful.

355
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,433
Come on, Mum. You promised me.

356
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:05,119
Why don't you get some of them
that you've got in blue?

357
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:09,073
Cos I don't like these. I want them ones,
Mum. Come on. You promised.

358
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,918
- They'll rub on your shin.
- They'll only be about that.

359
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,871
Be better in my size.

360
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:15,831
Come on. Where is she?

361
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,996
- Right.
- Well, that was nice timing.

362
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,553
I spoke too soon.

363
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:23,036
I hurt my shoulder back there.
Been ferreting about for ages.

364
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:25,992
- Are you all right, love?
- Pulled something in my shoulder.

365
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:28,508
Now, then, if I can just have that for a second...

366
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:30,994
- Let me have that, sweetheart.
- I want to hold it.

367
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:33,395
I'll just have that. Mum, shall I just...?

368
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,396
- Yeah.
- I'll just put that down there.

369
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:38,477
Ducky, darling, the ones
that you're looking at, these boots...

370
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:40,431
- Yeah?
...now, they're adult sizes

371
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,436
and you're a size four.

372
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:45,790
But these have just come in from London.

373
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:48,239
Are you ready for these?

374
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,236
These are fantastic.

375
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,669
- What the...?
- Oh, look at them, Shaun.

376
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,597
They're absolutely lovely.

377
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:57,870
- Do you want to hold one? There.
- Oh, my God.

378
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:00,388
- They're nice, aren't they?
- They're lovely, them.

379
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:01,793
Oh, they look lovely.

380
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:04,035
- Try 'em on.
- Where's the "Doc Marten" sign?

381
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,799
These ones, cos they're special
and they're from London,

382
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:10,196
they don't have the Doc Marten sign
on these - they're too special for that.

383
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:14,279
- It says "Tompkins" in it.
- The ones from London say Tompkins.

384
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,231
Everywhere else say "Dr Martens".

385
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:18,236
- I love them.
- These ones are special.

386
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:20,748
- Do you sell a lot of them?
- Yeah. Go like hot cakes.

387
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,313
Do you want to try one on? Shall we?

388
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:23,952
I fucking want them.

389
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,355
- If you swear... I'm sorry.
- It's all right.

390
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,595
- Shaun, don't swear.
- I want them ones.

391
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,790
- Listen, you can...
- I don't want them.

392
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:33,434
Chicken, don't upset your mum, eh?
Let's try 'em on.

393
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:35,596
Are you ready, Shaun?
- Yeah.

394
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:37,039
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

395
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:39,355
- You don't seem very confident.
- Just do it.

396
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:42,790
Your mum's not gonna come round,
is she, and whack my door down?

397
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:44,558
No. Just fricking do it.

398
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:46,750
Right. Here we go.

399
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,711
- Get that mop off.
- It's coming.

400
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,716
It's coming off.

401
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,671
- Oh, eh.
Ooh!

402
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:57,198
Flippin' heck. Eh.

403
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:59,913
- You have a right pink head.
- We're getting going now.

404
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:02,554
- Stop fidgeting.
- You're doing a good job, mate.

405
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:04,795
Oh, mate, it looks better already, that.

406
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:07,195
- Don't it, Milk?
- Definitely. Definitely.

407
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:09,151
- You're looking good.
- Head down.

408
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:13,514
Oh, there's loads of it.
It's just never-ending.

409
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:16,358
Don't be rough with him, Lol.
He's only a baby.

410
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:20,358
- Put your head up.
- You just told me to put it down, Lol.

411
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,630
And what an hairline, girls, eh?

412
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:24,398
Don't forget that bit.

413
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:25,953
I can see it.

414
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:28,315
Honestly, mate, it's sterling.

415
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:30,679
Get it off.

416
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:33,314
Really smart, in't he? In't he smart, eh?

417
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,920
- He does look good.
- Mate, I'm well impressed.

418
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,269
There we go, mate. That's you done.

419
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:40,719
Look at that!

420
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:43,115
Brush him down. He looks like a Yeti!

421
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:45,628
- Oh, mate, so smart, that.
- That's good, that.

422
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:47,591
Honestly, mate, you look sterling.

423
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:49,676
- So, am I in the gang now?
- Well, not yet.

424
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,870
Get your shirt on.
Let's see your Ben Sherman.

425
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,837
I... I ain't got a Ben Sherman.

426
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:56,348
- You telling me you've not got a shirt?
- No.

427
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,152
You told me to get jeans and the boots.

428
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:01,192
Are you having a laugh?
You can't go out all nipply, can you?

429
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:04,471
You're gonna have to come back next week.
I'll see you, mate.

430
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:07,910
- Honestly, have I really gotta go?
- Yeah, really, really.

431
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:09,678
Go on. You're gonna have to get off.

432
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:11,836
Shut t'door behind you,
there's a good lad.

433
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,791
Oh, hang on, I forgot about summat.

434
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:16,432
I were fucking lying!

435
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,828
Come here and give me a big hug.
Come here, fella.

436
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:23,555
I'm really proud of you, mate.
You look brilliant. Absolutely brilliant.

437
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:26,154
Get that body covered up
before t'girls go mad!

438
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,155
Ooh!

439
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,668
Amazing. Bang on.

440
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:31,631
Lol picked that for you.

441
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:34,638
- Look at that.
- It's a good fit, that. It's a good fit.

442
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:36,238
Let's have a look at you.

443
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:37,429
Ah, mate.

444
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:39,550
What a transformation!

445
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,192
He looks dead cute.

446
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:42,639
Pleased with it?

447
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:44,557
- Look at that.
- Ah, mate.

448
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:46,352
Bloody hell, here he is.
- Gadget!

449
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,834
Look at this.
- What? Who are you?

450
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,791
Oh-ho-ho, Shaun!

451
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:53,354
Oh-ho-ho! Look at that. Come here.

452
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,958
That's it. Good lad, Gadge.

453
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,479
Well done, mate.

454
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:58,909
Louie Louie

455
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,157

# Oh, baby

# I've got to go

00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:51,755
# Oh, yeah

# Come on, now

00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:36,669
# All right, now

# Oh, baby...

488
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:48,513
'Ey up, eh?

489
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,113
Home sweet home.

490
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:53,197
- It's all right round here, Shaun.
- It's a nice area, mate.

491
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:55,515
Cheers for today.
It's been the best day of my life.

492
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:56,709
Aw.

493
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:58,478
Fella, man,
you are more than welcome.

494
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:00,875
And I mean that
from the bottom of my heart. Any time.

495
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,717
- Tell him.
- Definitely. Any time, mate.

496
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:05,189
- Come here, you.
Any time, day or night.

497
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:07,151
Oh, oh!
Woo!

498
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,236
- Wa-hey!
- You've been practising!

499
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:11,236
Cheers for the haircut, Lol.

500
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:14,352
No worries. You make sure you come to
me when it needs redoing.

501
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:17,312
- Cheers for the shitty tea, Gadget.
- Get you!

502
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:21,875
Shaun?

503
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:23,795
Yeah?

504
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,518
Come here, please.

505
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:29,351
I just want to go straight to bed, Mum.

506
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:31,960
Come here, please.
You're two hours late.

507
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:35,479
- Please, Mum.
- Shaun, just come here!

508
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,119
Oh, my God.

509
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,193
Mum, please.

510
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:52,639
Please, Mum.

511
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,631
- Shaun, come on.
- Oh, man.

512
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:57,035
- Oh, Mum, please.
- I'm not messing around.

513
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:58,559
Now, in.

514
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:01,153
In you go, you.

515
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,713
- Eh, Shaun!
- Shaun, mate!

516
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:04,159
- Oh.
- Oh.

517
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:06,713
Who's Lol?

518
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:09,235
Me.

519
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:12,151
What have you done to his hair?

520
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:17,754
I... I did ask him, before I did it, if...
if you was all right with it.

521
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,677
Don't you think
you should have asked me?

522
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:20,675
Yeah.

523
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:22,273
I'm sorry.

524
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,390
Shaun, did I not ask you
if it was all right?

525
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:26,635
If he said, "Jump off a cliff",
would you do that?

526
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:28,870
No.

527
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:32,595
To be honest, you all look a bit... old
to be hanging around with him.

528
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:35,757
I'm only in the er... year bel...
above in school.

529
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:38,075
- Are you joking?
- No.

530
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:41,358
I've got problems.

531
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:45,797
Yeah, well, you will have problems
if you touch his hair again.

532
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,831
I'm really sorry.
- Who's Woody?

533
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:49,789
Behave.

534
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:52,638
- I'm Woody. I'm sorry, love.
- No, it's fine.

535
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:53,954
It's erm...

536
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,834
I just wanted to thank you. He said he's
being bullied and you'd helped him out.

537
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:00,678
- You're welcome.
- Yeah, I really appreciate that.

538
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:04,235
And the clothes and stuff.
I think he likes 'em. I don't mind that, at all.

539
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:05,998
But the hair is not good.

540
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:07,393
I'm really sorry.

541
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:10,989
I am. I wouldn't have done it
if I knew you didn't like it.

542
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:13,395
Listen, I'm gonna leave him here with you.

543
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,510
I'm gonna trust you, Shaun.

544
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:17,073
All right? Give us a kiss.

545
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:21,316
- See you later. Nice to meet you.
What's your name, love?

546
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,351
- Cynthia.
- Nice to meet you, Cynthia.

547
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,879
Nice to meet you all.

548
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:26,876
- See you in a bit, Shaun.
- See you, love.

549
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:28,831
- See you, later.
- Bye, Mum.

550
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,233
You idiot!

551
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,679
You shit yourself.

552
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:33,670
What?

553
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:36,075
- You shit yourself. You did.
- I didn't shit myself.

554
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,319
Hey, here he is!

555
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:43,914
- Where have you been?
- I've been getting a drink.

556
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:46,997
- You've been gone an hour.
- Look how pissed he is. Babycham?

557
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:48,758
Have you had it through a straw?

558
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,631
Wakey-wakey!

559
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:52,716
Pissed as a fart. Look at him.

560
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:57,516
You fancy Smell, don't you?

561
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:58,788
- Ah!
- No.

562
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:00,114
Do you like Smell?

563
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:03,913
Listen, I think, Shaun...
I think you've got a great chance.

564
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:06,190
- Oh, aye, love.
- You ain't got nothing to lose.

565
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,878
- Go on.
- She can only say no, mate.

566
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:09,831
You wanna give it a crack?

567
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:11,757
This can be a beautiful thing.

568
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,836
- Oh, my God. Fuckin' hell.
- Boob height.

569
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:15,757
That might be the perfect height.

570
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:17,153
Would you...

571
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,270
like to take a turn up the garden with me?

572
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:21,356
Oh, that's sweet.

573
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:23,231
You are, you're a little sweetheart.

574
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:25,157
I told you. It's making me emotional.

575
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:27,839
Ladies first.

576
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:29,359
Come on, then.
- Watch it.

577
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,470
- Ooh, sorry, mate.
- It's all right.

578
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:37,879
- Look at the sky.
- This is perfect, this is.

579
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,870
Look at the moonlight. It's beautiful.

580
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:42,319
Like you.

581
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,753
That is so cute.

582
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,631
You're a real charmer, you are.

583
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:51,913
Careful.

584
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,839
it were just...

585
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:59,711
What the fuck's that?

586
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,830
That sounds like the coppers,
that does.

587
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:03,438
Gary.

588
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:04,435
Gadget!

589
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:06,636
It's Gadget's mum and dad.

590
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:09,513
Get the fuck up, Gadge. Listen to me.
I want you to be sober. Yeah?

591
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:10,515
Sober.

592
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:12,471
All nice, good, sober.

593
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:14,431
- I am sober.
- Of course you are.

594
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:16,988
Fucking hide all the weed an' that, Milk.

595
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:21,788
Hello?

596
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,751
- Aaargh!
- Get fucking out!

597
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:33,588
Outside now!

598
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:36,598
If you want us to turn
the music down, we'll turn it down.

599
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:39,154
It's too fucking late for that!

600
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,633
These three.

601
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:42,716
Now get fucking up! Come on.

602
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:44,910
I'm coming, just...
- Not you. You.

603
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,518
Get outside!

604
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:48,073
Woody!
- Now!

605
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:49,519
Come on!

606
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:51,198
- It's all right.
- Kes, get up.

607
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:53,151
Yaaah!

608
00:31:57,400 --> 00:32:00,233
Look at him! Fucking hell, Combo!

609
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:02,157
Fucking hell, look at you!

610
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:04,350
Look at the fucking size of him.

611
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:06,510
Wow! Fucking look at you!

612
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:11,159
- Oh, fucking hell!
- Fucking look at you, man!

613
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,918
- Fucking hell.
- I missed you, man.

614
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:15,918
Fuck off, man. You fucking gave me
a heart attack, you bastard.

615
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:17,359
Who the fuck's he?

616
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:18,753
- Banjo.
- Banjo.

617
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:23,788
Three and a half years
with this fucking big bastard.

618
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:25,239
You lovely man.

619
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:28,477
Tell you what, there's fuck all
that this man hasn't seen.

620
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:31,592
Banjo, yeah?
Thanks for looking after him, mate.

621
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:34,234
- Look at the size of him, mate.
- Always ready to have a go.

622
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:35,998
Meggy! How are you, lad?

623
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:37,951
- How are you, mate?
- I'm all right.

624
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:39,553
Milk, fucking hell.

625
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,511
You shit me up there for a minute.

626
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:43,437
Listen to me now. This dude, here,

627
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:46,916
he spent three years in the pen for me,
he never said nothing.

628
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:49,394
If it weren't for him,
I wouldn't be with you guys now.

629
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:51,590
So, the utmost respect and I mean it.

630
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:53,039
I mean it.

631
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:54,513
Look at this, eh?

632
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:57,870
Look at you. Fucking hell!
You've blossomed, haven't you, love?

633
00:32:57,920 --> 00:33:00,229
- How are you doing?
- Not too bad. How are you?

634
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:03,033
All right. Easy, easy.
That's my other half, that.

635
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,434
- It's my other half, like.
- Nice one, mate.

636
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:08,436
I'm happy for yous.

637
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,473
Are you all right?

638
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:12,395
Yeah.

639
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:14,158
You look a bit nervous.

640
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:16,668
I'm not gonna do anything
you don't want me to.

641
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,991
Have you ever done this before?

642
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:21,433
Done it once.

643
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:22,799
In Germany.

644
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:24,273
In Germany?

645
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:26,470
Why did you go to Germany?

646
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:27,953
I was...

647
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,468
in Ger... Germany with my dad.

648
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:32,988
What did you do in Germany
with this girl?

649
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:34,553
Just kissed her.

650
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:36,716
Did you? Was she pretty?

651
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:39,995
Prettier than me?

652
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:41,758
- No way.
- Really?

653
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:45,391
Well, that's really cute of you.

654
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:48,351
Do you want a kiss?

655
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,911
We'll leave it today.

656
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:07,117
You might look about four,
but you kiss like a forty-year-old.

657
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:09,071
You're dead sensitive.

658
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:11,793
Are you all right?

659
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:14,829
Are you sure?

660
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,711
Do you want me to kiss you again?

661
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:34,598
Do you wanna suck my tits?

662
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:37,518
- Tell 'em a story.
- All right, if yous are making me.

663
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:40,716
All right, it took a little bit of time.

664
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:43,194
- But we did end up running things.
- We certainly did.

665
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:46,232
I mean, it's just...
I mean, for three weeks, right,

666
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:48,555
this fucking wog...

667
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:51,068
Right? Proper horrible.

668
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,353
Sorry, mate, sorry.

669
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:56,510
Didn't mean nothing by it.

670
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:59,199
You know, just slip of the tongue, like.

671
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:01,708
Sorry. This, you know, this brown gentleman...

672
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:05,555
...who... he was a bully,
he was a horrible bully.

673
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:07,875
No matter what colour he was,
he was a bully.

674
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,831
- And I hate bullies. Don't I, Wood?
- Yeah.

675
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:12,110
I can't stand them, man.
I can't stand 'em.

676
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:15,470
But for three weeks, right,
this fella was robbing my pudding.

677
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:17,278
What kind of pudding was it?

678
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:19,231
Doesn't matter what pudding it was.

679
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,952
The pudding's not the point.

680
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:24,197
The point is,
he was taking my pudding off me.

681
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:26,913
And I just thought,
"Nah, I'm not having it. I don't care.

682
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:29,110
You're not getting my pudding,
that's it."

683
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:32,311
So, I grabbed it and I've gone,
"No, mate, no, you're not having it."

684
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:33,873
He was like...

685
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,956
"White boy...

686
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,991
Give me your pud-pud."

687
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:42,675
Proper! Do you know what I mean?
And I've just thought, "No, man."

688
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,790
Nah, he did, right.

689
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:46,751
Eh!

690
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:50,189
Look at t'moosh on him.
- Smell his finger.

691
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:54,431
And who's been bloody smooching?

692
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:57,157
Come here, Shaun! Come on, man.

693
00:35:58,120 --> 00:36:00,918
I've got someone I want you to meet.
Come and stand here.

694
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:03,713
Now, listen to me.
This is a very special friend of mine.

695
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,273
Combo, Shaun.

696
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:06,753
Newest recruit.

697
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,233
Shaun. Combo.

698
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:09,759
What are you doing?

699
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,791
Just want to shake your hand.

700
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:13,353
Did you?

701
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:18,594
Are you a proper little skinhead,
then, yeah?

702
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:20,435
Yeah.

703
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:24,551
You look like a little Action Man.

704
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:28,354
Like a little Barbie doll.
You're dressed up an' all that. Look.

705
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,833
What?

706
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:35,594
I'm only messing with you, you little fucker.

707
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:37,551
I'm only messing with you.

708
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:39,955
He's all right.
- You're all right.

709
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:42,793
Nice one, lad.
Sit down, anyway, I'm telling a story.

710
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:44,239
Sit next to Milky.

711
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,990
Anyway, where was I?
What... Where was I?

712
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:52,952
You were on about that er...
"brown gentleman"

713
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,718
stealing your "pud-pud".

714
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:58,514
That's right, yeah. Yeah.
So, I've said, "No, you're not having it."

715
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:01,597
This one day, right,
I've been grafting all morning,

716
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:04,791
just shovelling shit, constantly,
all morning, non-stop.

717
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:06,512
Weren't I? And I'm fucking starving.

718
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:07,913
# gentle piano

719
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:09,632
You know, like that proper hunger.

720
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:13,639
And I'm thinking, "Right, just eat my pudding,
just go and eat my pudding."

721
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:16,592
I've just finished
the last fucking mouthful and then,

722
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:19,712
this big, black, sweaty hand

723
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:22,433
has just gone wallop, right in my pudding.

724
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,198
Do you know what I mean?

725
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:28,199
Proper big cigar fingers,
all over my fucking crumble and custard...

726
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:31,469
I just thought,
"No, I'm not having it, I don't care.

727
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:34,193
You're not getting my pudding, that's it."

728
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:37,835
I just took his hand out and just looked
him right in the face and I've gone...

729
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:48,555
Woody.

730
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:15,836
So, last night was good fun, weren't it?

731
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:19,111
- Don't start.
- I'm just saying, a really good night.

732
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:22,232
I know what sort of a bloody night it was.
It were awkward.

733
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:24,840
It was er... a little on the tense side.

734
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,791
I know, mate, I'm sorry.

735
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:30,116
I knew he'd do it. I knew he'd have to
throw his bloody weight around.

736
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:31,718
Has to be number one.

737
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:34,957
He were like that before he went in.
Nowt's frigging changed, at all.

738
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:37,429
Hang on. Wait.
He hardly did anything wrong, anyway.

739
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:39,755
- I thought he was all right.
- I've got an idea.

740
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:42,877
How about you climb out of his arse
for five minutes, Puke, eh?

741
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:44,911
Trust you to fucking jump on his dick.

742
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:47,633
I'm not. I'm just saying,
he was just telling a story.

743
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:49,597
You asked for a story, he told it you.

744
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:51,949
I'll tell you a story
if you don't shut your mouth.

745
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:58,079
All right, boys?

746
00:38:58,120 --> 00:39:00,111
- You all right, Combo?
- All right, Gadge.

747
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:01,912
- Puke.
- All right, mate.

748
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:04,110
'Ey up. What's up?

749
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:07,118
- Can I just have a little word with you?
- I've got a brew coming.

750
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:09,594
- Only be two minutes. Come 'ed.
- Bastard.

751
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:11,631
Woody, don't be long cos I wanna get off.

752
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:13,836
- All right, love.
- Be two minutes, Lol.

753
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:17,153
All right, lad?

754
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:20,799
I said, "All right?"

755
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:23,559
What was that for? That hurt!

756
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:26,478
- Woody, hurry up.
- I will, love, yeah.

757
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:32,758
Milky, I'd watch it.
I think summat's gonna kick off.

758
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:35,035
Don't worry. I'm more than ready.

759
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:37,435
You're making a big deal
out of nothing, anyway.

760
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:38,879
- He's all right.
- He's not.

761
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:39,875
Kel!

762
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,876
Kelly, you don't even know him.

763
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,036
- What's up?
You all right, Woods?

764
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:48,991
All right, lad.

765
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:54,394
- Go on, then. What's happened?
- We've to...

766
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:56,510
We've to bob round tomorrow morning.

767
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:18,754
I tell you, I shouldn't be here, you know.
This don't feel good, at all.

768
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:22,076
Look at the size of that brew.
Who drinks a brew that big?

769
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:31,639
I bet you all thought I was a right fucking
horrible, horrible, horrible

770
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:33,750
little bastard the other day, didn't you?

771
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,677
- A little bit.
- A bit?

772
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:38,598
Tell the truth, Wood, man.
I was fucking horrible, weren't I?

773
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:40,318
- A bit of a bastard, man.
- Yeah.

774
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:42,271
Yeah, well, you were a snake.

775
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:46,274
You were a fucking serpent
from the Bible, weren't you?

776
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:50,512
Do you wanna know why, Wood?
Do you want me to tell you why?

777
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:51,555
Yeah?

778
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:54,715
Cos see that man, there, Milky?

779
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:57,113
That man there

780
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:58,718
took abuse off me.

781
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:02,712
And I said some horrible things, Milk,
and I'm fucking sorry.

782
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:05,352
You let me abuse him.

783
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:07,994
And what did you do?
What did you do, Wood?

784
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:10,235
- I didn't do anything.
- I can't hear you.

785
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:13,113
- I didn't do nothing.
- Exactly. Nothing. Fuck all.

786
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:14,673
Neither did any of yous.

787
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:17,871
Not one of yous stood up
and made yourself count for that man there.

788
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:20,036
And that was fucking wrong.

789
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:24,629
Milk, honest to God,
I'm really glad you came here today.

790
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:26,716
And I mean that, mate,
I really mean that.

791
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:30,717
Cos I've got one question to ask you.
Just one question.

792
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:35,390
When you've heard it, if you want to leave,
you can leave, that's fine by me.

793
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:37,351
But I've got one question to ask you.

794
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:39,356
Do you consider yourself

795
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:41,118
English or Jamaican?

796
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:55,193
English.

797
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:05,915
Lovely. I love you for that.
That's fucking great. I'm proud, man.

798
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:08,349
Learn from him.
That's a proud man, there.

799
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:12,478
That's what we need, man.

800
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:14,795
That's what this nation
has been built on.

801
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:17,917
Proud men. Proud fucking warriors.

802
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:21,794
Two thousand years,
this little tiny fucking island

803
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:23,956
has been raped and pillaged

804
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,878
by people who have come here
and wanted a piece of it.

805
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:30,356
Two fucking world wars,
men have laid down their lives for this.

806
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:33,276
For this, and for what?

807
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:35,788
So we can stick our fucking flag
in the ground and say,

808
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:37,478
"Yeah, this is England

809
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:39,033
and this is England

810
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:40,593
and this is England."

811
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:44,518
And for what?

812
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:46,516
For what now?

813
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:48,471
Eh, what for?

814
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:52,591
So we can just open the fucking floodgates
and let them all come in?

815
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:54,437
And say, "Yeah, come on, come in.

816
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:57,438
Get off your ship. Did you have
a safe journey? Was it hard?

817
00:42:57,480 --> 00:43:00,199
Here y'are, here's a corner,
why don't you build a shop?

818
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:03,516
Better still, why don't you build a shop
and then build a church?

819
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:06,393
Follow your own fucking religions.
Do what you want."

820
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:10,479
When there's single fucking parents
out there, who can't get a fucking flat

821
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:12,476
and they're being given to these...

822
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:15,637
And I'm gonna say it,
cos you're gonna have to fucking hear it.

823
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:18,990
We're giving the flats
to these fucking Pakis. Right?

824
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:23,158
Who've got 50 and 60
in a fucking flat on their own.

825
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:25,390
Right? We're giving that to them.

826
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:28,398
There's three and a half million
unemployed out there.

827
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:31,671
Three and a half million of us,
who can't find fucking work.

828
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:34,757
Cos they're taking them all.
Cos it's fucking cheap labour.

829
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:36,313
Cheap and easy labour.

830
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:39,636
Fucking cheap and easy,
which makes us cheap and easy.

831
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:41,875
Three and a half fucking million!

832
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:44,275
It's not a joke. It's not a fucking joke.

833
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:48,154
And that Thatcher sits there
in her fucking ivory tower

834
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:50,714
and sends us on a fucking phoney war!

835
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:52,079
The Falklands?

836
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:53,838
The fucking Falklands?

837
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:55,791
What the fuck's The Falklands?

838
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:58,713
Fucking innocent men,
good fucking strong men.

839
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:01,797
Good soldiers,
real people losing their lives,

840
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:04,752
going over there thinking
they're fighting for a fucking cause.

841
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:07,473
What are they fighting for?
What are they fighting against?

842
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:09,715
Fucking shepherds!
Shepherds with fucking...

843
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:11,671
Shut up about The Falklands.

844
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:13,233
- Why?
- Cos I want you to.

845
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:16,158
There's fucking loads of dickheads dying
out there for nothing.

846
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:18,316
My fucking dad weren't a dickhead!

847
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:19,588
What are you doing?

848
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:21,591
- Fuck off! Shut up!
- What am I doing wrong?

849
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:23,949
Whoa, there, little one.
What's wrong, mate?

850
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,434
- Tell me the truth. Come on.
- I just fucking...

851
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:27,879
That's it. Go on.

852
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:29,831
My fucking dad died in that war!

853
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:31,791
- Your dad died?
- Yeah. Get off!

854
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:35,678
- Fucking hell, mate, I'm sorry.
- Fucking shut up about it!

855
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:37,119
I'm sorry, mate.

856
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:38,912
Fucking hell, I'm sorry, lad.

857
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:41,757
I'm sorry. I never knew he died, man.

858
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:43,153
Fucking hell.

859
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:45,111
Oh, look, mate, if I'd have known,

860
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:48,550
honest, I wouldn't have said, man,
but what I'm telling you is the truth.

861
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:51,592
I can't lie to you.
It's a pathetic war, man.

862
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:54,791
And you want your dad's life
to mean something, don't you?

863
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:57,115
And this breaks my fucking heart to say it.

864
00:44:57,160 --> 00:44:59,071
We shouldn't have been there.

865
00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:01,918
She lied to us.
She lied to me. She lied to you.

866
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:04,349
But, most importantly, she lied to your dad.

867
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:08,916
If you don't stand up and fight this fucking fight
that's going on on the streets,

868
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:11,076
your dad died for nothing.

869
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:12,838
He died for nothing.

870
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:14,916
You've got to carry it on, man, in here.

871
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:19,469
In your little fucking heart,
you've got the pride of your dad, man.

872
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:24,308
Fucking hell.

873
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:28,837
That little fucking whippersnapper
has set the standard.

874
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:32,633
- Can you believe that, Banj?
- You can't, can you, at that age?

875
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:33,908
Fucking hell.

876
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:35,359
What a gem.

877
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:37,118
What a fucking gem.

878
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:38,593
All right, look.

879
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:49,551
There's the line, boys.

880
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:52,273
That means
you're all quite welcome to just leave

881
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:55,471
and leave now and never come back
and that's it, the end of it.

882
00:45:56,440 --> 00:45:58,158
But if you wanna stay,

883
00:45:58,200 --> 00:45:59,918
this is a proper fight.

884
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:03,635
Now yous all either cross that line
and go your merry little way...

885
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:07,319
...or you stay where you are
and you come with me.

886
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:09,197
The choice is yours, boys.

887
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:13,435
Fucking hell!
That was a bit quick, weren't it?

888
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:15,835
I ain't being fucking brainwashed, Combo.

889
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:18,189
Oh, listen to fucking Sigmund Void there.

890
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:21,277
You're well out of line.
Well out of line, man.

891
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:23,231
Come on, lads, let's have you.

892
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:24,514
Come on, then.

893
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:25,993
Come on, Puke, mate.

894
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:27,758
Sit down.

895
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:30,472
You what?

896
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:32,431
Kes, just sit down.

897
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:36,553
No. No, you can't be serious, mate.
We'll talk about this outside.

898
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:38,192
Kes, just sit down.

899
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:40,629
Puke, man, fucking come.
What you on about?

900
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:42,352
Look, he's fucking right.

901
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:45,231
What can I do, man? Are you coming?

902
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:46,030
No.

903
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:49,516
- Gadge, come on, Tubs, man.
- Fuck off calling me Tubs!

904
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:51,118
I'm sick of you, Woody.

905
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:54,072
This is why I'm staying,
because you're always taking the piss,

906
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:56,031
making me feel that fucking big.

907
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:57,991
He's put things into perspective.

908
00:46:58,840 --> 00:47:01,798
Look at the other night.
You didn't step up once then.

909
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:08,633
Join me.

910
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:16,474
Milky, man,
I know I let you down the other night,

911
00:47:16,520 --> 00:47:19,876
but I swear to you
I'll never fucking do it again. Look at me.

912
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:22,758
I'd never do it again.
I swear to God I wouldn't, man.

913
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:27,148
You're my bro, man. What the fuck?

914
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:40,428
Come on, mate.

915
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:49,595
Shaun? Come on, man. We're off.

916
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:51,596
Come on, Shaun.
- No.

917
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:53,835
Shaun, man, you can't fucking stay here.

918
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:54,995
Shaun?

919
00:47:55,960 --> 00:47:59,635
He's just a kid. The things you've said
have made him want to stay.

920
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:01,796
Woody, I wanna make my dad proud.

921
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:03,239
Listen, love...

922
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:04,998
See you later, mate.

923
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:06,991
See you later, Lol, love.

924
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:08,951
He's 12. I can't leave him here.

925
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,309
- Go.
- Nothing we can do if he wants to stay.

926
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:13,510
You fucking look after him, do you hear me?

927
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:15,949
He can look after himself. He's proved that.

928
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,433
See yous later.

929
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:19,391
Come on, love.

930
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:21,396
Come on, now.

931
00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:29,918
See you later, mate.

932
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:36,633
Don't forget, you've got a snake
in the grass with you there.

933
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:38,318
You're a good man.

934
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:40,271
A brave good man, man.

935
00:48:41,240 --> 00:48:42,878
A really good man.

936
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:46,595
A cup of tea for the boys there, Banj.
Few Pot Noodles or something.

937
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:49,279
I'm fucking gagging for a shit, me,
I'm telling you.

938
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:08,958
Don't worry about it.

939
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:11,831
I'll have a word with Woody.

940
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:13,791
I'll sort it, I promise you.

941
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:15,353
I just feel really bad.

942
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:17,277
He looked gutted, Combo.

943
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:19,470
I know, I feel bad, as well, but...

944
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:21,431
Oh, fucking hell, let's face it.

945
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:23,391
Woody's not like me and you.

946
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:27,839
No, he's fucking certainly not like you.

947
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:30,713
No-one's ever fucking took a swing at me
like that.

948
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:32,432
- Really?
- Honest.

949
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:33,469
Honest.

950
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:36,118
It's like looking in the mirror.

951
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:39,274
20 years ago, when I was fucking 12,

952
00:49:39,320 --> 00:49:41,276
taking swings at big men.

953
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:44,551
I don't know, I just don't like
people speaking about my dad,

954
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:46,318
even in a nice way.

955
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:48,954
I don't even like people
speaking about the war.

956
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,911
You loved him, didn't you?

957
00:49:55,720 --> 00:49:56,709
Yeah.

958
00:49:59,560 --> 00:50:01,118
And then you lost him.

959
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:06,433
Yeah.

960
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:10,278
I know what it's like.

961
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:13,511
To have people walk out on you.

962
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:16,028
To have people just fucking leave you.

963
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:21,437
Honest, lad, I know how you feel.

964
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:24,511
If you ever want anyone to talk to...

965
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:27,598
...someone to cry with

966
00:50:27,640 --> 00:50:29,835
or just to fucking have a hug

967
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:31,791
or punch the fuck out of 'em,

968
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:33,910
I'm telling you, I'll be there for you.

969
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:35,871
I won't turn my back on you.

970
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,718
I promise you that.

971
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:43,909
Spit.

972
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,116
That's a man's handshake, that.

973
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:49,559
I promise you.

974
00:50:50,440 --> 00:50:52,670
I won't let you down.

975
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:55,837
# Soldiers of Islam
are loading their guns

976
00:50:55,880 --> 00:50:57,791
# They're getting ready

977
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:02,476
# But the Russian tanks
are mowing them down

978
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:04,238
# They're getting ready

979
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:10,033
# There's children in Africa
with Tommy guns

980
00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:11,593
# Getting ready

981
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:16,235
# While the Islam armies
are beckoning on

982
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:18,236
# They're getting ready

983
00:51:19,560 --> 00:51:21,471
# There's a burning sun

984
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:24,830
# And it sets in the Western world

985
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:27,950
# But it rises in the East

986
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:32,232
# And pretty soon
it's gonna burn your temples down

987
00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:36,150
# While the heads of state
are having their fun

988
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:38,433
# Are they ready?

989
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:43,475
# We're looking at the world
through the barrel of a gun

990
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:45,158
# Are we ready?

991
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:50,115
# And you stand there
beating on your little war drum

992
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:51,878
# Are you ready...

993
00:51:55,560 --> 00:51:58,836
- Look at the size of that dog.
- Gadge, have a look at that dog.

994
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:00,950
Just get on with it.

995
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,275
Excuse me, mate,
is there a toilet here?

996
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:06,151
Ah, my arse is killing.

997
00:52:07,640 --> 00:52:09,551
- All right, boss?
- Round the back.

998
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:11,511
- Round the back.
- Cheers, boss.

999
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:22,318
I am hungry, yeah.
There should be a barbecue or something.

1000
00:52:22,360 --> 00:52:23,918
Buffet food...

1001
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:26,598
All right, look, yous three,

1002
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:28,995
yous three, I want yous on your best behaviour.

1003
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:31,031
Right? Your fucking best behaviour.

1004
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:34,191
Ooh, he's got a nice car!

1005
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:37,519
Nice car.

1006
00:52:38,560 --> 00:52:40,676
Here they are.
Wait there. Hold it back, lads.

1007
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:42,631
- Just wait there.
- Come on.

1008
00:52:42,680 --> 00:52:45,114
Just wait there.
Behave yourself. Wait there.

1009
00:52:45,160 --> 00:52:46,559
You all right?

1010
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:49,916
How are you, Arthur? Good to see you.

1011
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:51,678
All right, Lenny, mate.

1012
00:52:51,720 --> 00:52:53,631
All right? A pleasure. A pleasure.

1013
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:55,079
All right, mate.

1014
00:52:56,120 --> 00:52:59,351
Gentlemen, there is a forgotten word.

1015
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:00,594
No.

1016
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:02,312
An almost forbidden word.

1017
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:05,589
A word that means more to me
than any other.

1018
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:08,352
That word is "England".

1019
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:09,719
Yes!

1020
00:53:14,520 --> 00:53:19,036
Once, we flaunted it in the face of the world,
like a banner.

1021
00:53:19,080 --> 00:53:20,991
It was a word that stood for power.

1022
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:24,155
A word that stood for freedom.

1023
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:26,111
A word that stood for respect.

1024
00:53:27,080 --> 00:53:28,513
But today,

1025
00:53:28,560 --> 00:53:31,870
we're scarcely even allowed
to speak the name of our country.

1026
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:33,353
Gadge, are you honestly...

1027
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:36,551
Well, I want to revive that word,
a grand old word,

1028
00:53:36,600 --> 00:53:38,511
the word "Englishman".

1029
00:53:38,560 --> 00:53:39,675
Yes! Yes!

1030
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:40,675
Yes!

1031
00:53:43,160 --> 00:53:45,071
Now we've been marginalised.

1032
00:53:45,120 --> 00:53:47,031
We've been called "cranks".

1033
00:53:47,080 --> 00:53:48,832
We're not cranks.

1034
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:50,996
Some people say we're racists.

1035
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:53,190
We're not racists. We're realists.

1036
00:53:53,240 --> 00:53:55,595
Some people call us Nazis.

1037
00:53:55,640 --> 00:53:57,551
We're not Nazis.

1038
00:53:57,600 --> 00:54:00,592
No, what we are, we are nationalists.

1039
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:04,269
And there's a reason
people try to pigeonhole us like this.

1040
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:07,073
And that is because of one word, gentlemen.

1041
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:09,031
- Fear.
Yeah.

1042
00:54:09,080 --> 00:54:10,593
They fear us.

1043
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:14,428
They fear us because we are the true voice
of the people of this country.

1044
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:16,232
- Yes!
Yes, Lenny.

1045
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:18,236
People who work hard,

1046
00:54:18,280 --> 00:54:19,872
pay their way,

1047
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:22,514
it don't matter
what their ethnic background is,

1048
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:24,790
I welcome with open arms in this country.

1049
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:27,434
It's the people who think
we owe them a living.

1050
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:30,358
These are the people that need to go back.

1051
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:32,118
Yes!

1052
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:33,673
Send them back!

1053
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:36,154
- Send the bastards back!
- Send them back!

1054
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:37,519
Send them back!

1055
00:54:37,560 --> 00:54:39,835
An English king on a battlefield once said,

1056
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:43,555
"From this day till the end of the world,
only we in it shall be remembered,

1057
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:47,149
we few, we happy few,
we band of brothers."

1058
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:49,509
Gentlemen, it is the time to stand up
and be counted.

1059
00:54:49,560 --> 00:54:52,028
Yes!
- It is the time for action.

1060
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:54,913
Our country has been stolen
from under our noses.

1061
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:56,439
Yes!

1062
00:54:56,480 --> 00:54:58,835
Well, gentlemen,
it's time to take it back!

1063
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:00,029
Yes!

1064
00:55:00,080 --> 00:55:02,275
Yes! Go on, Lenny! Go on, Lenny!

1065
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:04,675
Are you ready to return to the fight?

1066
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:05,709
Yes!

1067
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:08,228
- Are you ready to shed blood?
Yes!

1068
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:11,272
Are you ready to fight for this country
with your last breath of life?

1069
00:55:11,320 --> 00:55:12,435
Yes!

1070
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:14,596
Lenny! Lenny! Lenny!

1071
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:16,039
Lenny! Lenny...

1072
00:55:16,080 --> 00:55:19,390
Gentlemen, join our band of brothers.
Sign up today.

1073
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:21,317
Thank you very much. Thank you.

1074
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:22,349
Yes!

1075
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:24,914
I'm going to have a word with Lenny.
Yous wait here.

1076
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:27,394
- Amazing that.
- You're dead right.

1077
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:33,315
Fucking, Gadge.
- What?

1078
00:55:33,360 --> 00:55:35,271
Do you not feel bad about Woody?

1079
00:55:35,320 --> 00:55:37,880
What do you mean,
do I not feel bad about him? Look.

1080
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:39,871
Look at all these people in here.

1081
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:41,433
This is right.

1082
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:44,074
If it wasn't right,
all these wouldn't be here.

1083
00:55:44,120 --> 00:55:46,076
- Think about...
- I'm not saying that.

1084
00:55:46,120 --> 00:55:48,680
Do you not feel bad
about just leaving him like that?

1085
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:51,075
- He's been our mate for...
- We've not left him.

1086
00:55:51,120 --> 00:55:52,633
I'm still his friend.

1087
00:55:54,280 --> 00:55:55,474
Comb...

1088
00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:59,115
You know, you're supposed to have
a qualified driver in the front.

1089
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:02,917
Are you gonna fucking report me?

1090
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:04,518
Well, it's illegal.

1091
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:09,269
We're really squashed in the back here.

1092
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:12,511
Can one of us come up the front?

1093
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:21,751
Shall we show him?
Shall we show him?

1094
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:26,758
Don't look, Comb.

1095
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:28,313
What is it, lad?

1096
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:35,233
Fuck off!

1097
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:37,589
That's my fucking boy! Look at that.

1098
00:56:37,640 --> 00:56:41,189
That's why he's in the fucking front,
Meggy, you fucking gobshite.

1099
00:56:41,240 --> 00:56:43,879
- Do you like it?
- It's fucking brilliant, that.

1100
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:45,273
Fucking brilliant.

1101
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:47,590
Do you reckon Lenny'll mind
that we nicked it?

1102
00:56:47,640 --> 00:56:51,394
No, will he fuck. That's going in
the middle of the wall, back in the flat.

1103
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:53,351
We'll build all our stuff round that.

1104
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:56,278
That's gonna be our fucking centrepiece.
That's the focus.

1105
00:56:57,640 --> 00:56:59,551
- Glad you like it.
- Nice one, son.

1106
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:01,477
What's it called, that flag?

1107
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:03,715
St George's Cross, isn't it, Combo?

1108
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:06,672
Yeah. St fucking George's Cross.

1109
00:57:07,640 --> 00:57:09,551
You all right there, Pukes, lad?

1110
00:57:11,120 --> 00:57:13,031
Yeah, I am. I was thinking, mate.

1111
00:57:13,080 --> 00:57:14,991
You seem a bit quiet, lad.

1112
00:57:16,080 --> 00:57:17,399
Yeah.

1113
00:57:20,560 --> 00:57:22,437
You got a problem, then, or what?

1114
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:25,119
No, I've just got things on my mind, Combo.

1115
00:57:25,160 --> 00:57:26,559
Like what?

1116
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:29,833
Well, like...

1117
00:57:30,840 --> 00:57:32,751
Well, can I ask you something?

1118
00:57:33,720 --> 00:57:36,598
Do you really believe
in all that shit, Combo?

1119
00:57:40,840 --> 00:57:42,432
Fucking hell, Comb!

1120
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:44,550
Oi, Gadge, come with me.
He's getting me out.

1121
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:47,353
Open the fucking door!
Get fucking out now!

1122
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:50,119
- Get fucking out!
- All right, all right, all right.

1123
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:52,469
Out of the car.
Get out, you little fucking shitbag.

1124
00:57:52,560 --> 00:57:53,470
You...

1125
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:55,431
don't you fucking ever...

1126
00:57:55,480 --> 00:58:00,508
...fucking ever, ever undermine me again
in front of my fucking troops.

1127
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:02,471
Do you understand me?

1128
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:04,636
Do you understand me? Eh? Yeah?

1129
00:58:04,680 --> 00:58:07,797
Now, fuck off back to Woody,
you little fucking queer.

1130
00:58:07,840 --> 00:58:09,956
Go on, fuck off! Fuck off!

1131
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,230
- You little queer.
- Oi, lads.

1132
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:15,031
- Oi, Shaun, man, come.
- Leave him alone.

1133
00:58:15,080 --> 00:58:16,991
- Oi, come out.
- Sorry, mate.

1134
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:19,156
- I can't.
- Fuck off. Leave him alone. Walk!

1135
00:58:19,240 --> 00:58:20,753
What the fuck?

1136
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:22,791
Waaaah!

1137
00:58:59,480 --> 00:59:03,314
Right, this is where all the fucking Pakis
go to work in the chicken factory.

1138
00:59:03,360 --> 00:59:06,079
- Fucking do it, boys.
- Can we go to the chicken factory?

1139
00:59:06,840 --> 00:59:08,956
- Just fucking do it.
- What shall I put?

1140
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:10,911
Anything. Put anything you want.

1141
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:22,911
Fucking bastards!

1142
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:26,635
Don't fucking come back,
you fucking little whore!

1143
00:59:29,320 --> 00:59:31,231
Fuck off.

1144
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:34,632
Go on. On your own.

1145
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:37,188
Yeah, fuck off, you Paki bastards!

1146
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:38,798
- Fuck off.
- Go on, son!

1147
00:59:39,760 --> 00:59:41,159
Hey-hey!

1148
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:45,712
Look at these
little fucking sewer rats. Look.

1149
00:59:46,680 --> 00:59:48,238
Fucking vermin.

1150
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:50,474
Oi!

1151
00:59:58,680 --> 01:00:02,719
Now, that's our ball now.
Right? And we're playing here.

1152
01:00:02,760 --> 01:00:06,230
So, I suggest you take fucking
Tweedledum and Tweedledee

1153
01:00:06,280 --> 01:00:07,998
and fuck off home.

1154
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:11,269
If I see you on my streets again...

1155
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:14,433
...I'll slash you.

1156
01:00:15,880 --> 01:00:19,509
And it'll be a hundred times
fucking worse.

1157
01:00:19,560 --> 01:00:20,879
- All right?
- Yeah.

1158
01:00:20,920 --> 01:00:23,718
Now run home,
cos Mummy's cooking curry. Go on.

1159
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:25,034
Meggy!

1160
01:00:27,320 --> 01:00:29,038
Get in goal, Gadge.

1161
01:01:24,160 --> 01:01:25,673
Have a look in there.

1162
01:01:31,240 --> 01:01:32,753
- Is that for me?
- Yeah.

1163
01:01:33,840 --> 01:01:35,751
We need to fly that with pride.

1164
01:01:41,920 --> 01:01:43,433
See you tonight, Woody.

1165
01:02:04,240 --> 01:02:07,198
Hey, Meggy, how do you spell "off"?
Is it one "f" or two?

1166
01:02:08,280 --> 01:02:09,998
Meggy, one "f" or two?

1167
01:02:18,280 --> 01:02:20,191
Get me... a hundred fags,

1168
01:02:20,240 --> 01:02:24,119
two bottles of wine, a bottle of whisky,
and ten cans of lager now.

1169
01:02:24,160 --> 01:02:26,276
You know what you're gonna have?
Nothing.

1170
01:02:26,320 --> 01:02:27,275
What?

1171
01:02:27,320 --> 01:02:29,709
You know you're not supposed
to be here. Go. Out.

1172
01:02:29,760 --> 01:02:31,796
Just fucking get 'em, you Paki bastard!

1173
01:02:32,600 --> 01:02:34,158
What did you say?

1174
01:02:34,200 --> 01:02:37,192
Get them, you filthy Paki bastard.

1175
01:02:38,160 --> 01:02:39,912
Right, that's it.

1176
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,434
Just... Wait till I just...

1177
01:02:45,440 --> 01:02:46,509
Get off!

1178
01:02:46,560 --> 01:02:48,835
- Get out!
- What's going on, mate? Problem?

1179
01:02:48,880 --> 01:02:50,598
He's been calling me a Paki bastard.

1180
01:02:50,640 --> 01:02:51,959
Open the door.

1181
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,434
Get your fucking hands off him now!

1182
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:56,232
Fucking hands off him!

1183
01:02:56,280 --> 01:02:59,590
Take what you want, kid.
Take the fucking whisky and the ciggies.

1184
01:02:59,640 --> 01:03:01,551
Oi, oi!

1185
01:03:02,920 --> 01:03:04,831
Go on, lads, get the gear.

1186
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:06,791
Come on. Everything.

1187
01:03:06,840 --> 01:03:09,354
Come on, hurry up, don't fuck about.

1188
01:03:11,840 --> 01:03:13,751
What are you fucking doing?

1189
01:03:13,800 --> 01:03:16,712
- I'm having a shit.
- Oh, for fuck's sake, man!

1190
01:03:16,760 --> 01:03:18,671
- Put your arse away.
You bastard.

1191
01:03:18,760 --> 01:03:20,751
Come on, hurry up. Get the stuff, mate.

1192
01:03:20,800 --> 01:03:24,349
For fuck's sake, we need booze
and fags for tonight, lads. Come on.

1193
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:27,710
Fucking hell, Gadge, could you get
any more fucking sweets, man?

1194
01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:28,988
Fucking hell.

1195
01:03:29,040 --> 01:03:31,235
- Put 'em in the car.
- Come on.

1196
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:32,474
Paki!

1197
01:03:33,600 --> 01:03:35,238
Yeah, Paki.

1198
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:37,510
Picking on a kid, mate? Fucking hell.

1199
01:03:37,560 --> 01:03:39,869
Picking on a fucking kid, was you?

1200
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:41,512
- Eh?
- Take what you want and go.

1201
01:03:41,600 --> 01:03:45,309
Shut up! I'm talking.
I'm your fucking size. Fuck with me.

1202
01:03:45,360 --> 01:03:47,032
You've got what you want. Just go now.

1203
01:03:47,080 --> 01:03:48,798
Don't you fucking dare backchat me,

1204
01:03:48,840 --> 01:03:52,958
cos I will slay you now where you fucking
stand, you fucking Paki cunt.

1205
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:54,069
Right?

1206
01:03:54,120 --> 01:03:56,395
You listen to fucking me!

1207
01:03:56,440 --> 01:03:59,238
That fucking kid's dad died
for this fucking country.

1208
01:03:59,280 --> 01:04:01,077
What have you fucking done for it?

1209
01:04:01,120 --> 01:04:04,078
Fuck all, but take fucking jobs
off decent people.

1210
01:04:04,120 --> 01:04:06,236
Now, listen, son, listen good.

1211
01:04:06,280 --> 01:04:09,909
We'll be back here whenever we want,
right, cos this is fucking ours now.

1212
01:04:09,960 --> 01:04:12,155
This is ours, this, fucking Sandhu.

1213
01:04:12,200 --> 01:04:14,475
Don't forget that. Any fucking time.

1214
01:04:14,520 --> 01:04:17,318
And clean the place up.
It fucking stinks of curry.

1215
01:04:17,360 --> 01:04:18,759
Fucking stinks.

1216
01:04:18,800 --> 01:04:21,030
Reeks of the fucking shit.

1217
01:04:21,080 --> 01:04:23,275
What yous doing, boys?

1218
01:04:23,320 --> 01:04:26,756
Get in the fucking car, will you?
Get in the fucking car!

1219
01:04:26,800 --> 01:04:28,518
You've got the fucking keys.

1220
01:04:29,880 --> 01:04:33,190
Get in the fucking car now.
Look at my fucking arse!

1221
01:04:33,240 --> 01:04:35,549
Get in the fucking car. Hurry up!

1222
01:04:36,600 --> 01:04:38,511
This is a very posh area.

1223
01:04:38,560 --> 01:04:41,518
What did you say
her dad did for a living, Gadget?

1224
01:04:41,560 --> 01:04:43,676
- Works on the oil rigs.
- Fucking hell.

1225
01:04:43,720 --> 01:04:46,598
I fancy some posh totty.
Which one is it?

1226
01:04:46,640 --> 01:04:48,835
- The one with the balloons.
Here.

1227
01:04:48,880 --> 01:04:50,313
Fucking hell.

1228
01:04:50,360 --> 01:04:52,271
Put the brakes on.

1229
01:04:52,320 --> 01:04:53,833
That'll do us, won't it?

1230
01:04:53,880 --> 01:04:55,791
I can't wait to see Smell.

1231
01:04:55,840 --> 01:04:58,149
- So, Smell, you're finally legal.
- Yeah.

1232
01:04:58,200 --> 01:05:00,111
Not that it ever made a difference.

1233
01:05:05,560 --> 01:05:07,471
- Ready? Three...
- Wait, wait.

1234
01:05:07,520 --> 01:05:09,431
Come on. Wait there. Are we all here?

1235
01:05:09,480 --> 01:05:10,913
Right.

1236
01:05:10,960 --> 01:05:13,952
- Smell, get us a drink.
I've had chronic pains.

1237
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:15,558
- Strippers!
- Constipation.

1238
01:05:15,600 --> 01:05:17,670
- Someone at the door!
- Stop now, yeah?

1239
01:05:17,720 --> 01:05:18,948
Hi, lad.

1240
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:20,911
- Hello.
- Woody! Woody!

1241
01:05:20,960 --> 01:05:22,234
Hello-o-o.

1242
01:05:22,280 --> 01:05:25,795
- Hello-o-o.
- Hello-o-o.

1243
01:05:25,840 --> 01:05:27,751
Hello-o-o.

1244
01:05:27,800 --> 01:05:29,392
# Happy...
# Happy...

1245
01:05:29,600 --> 01:05:31,238
# Happy...
# Happy...

1246
01:05:31,280 --> 01:05:32,793
# Happy birthday
# Happy birthday

1247
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:36,629
# Happy birthday
# Happy birthday

1248
01:05:36,680 --> 01:05:38,910
Happy birthday, Smell!

1249
01:05:40,760 --> 01:05:42,751
It was better in the car.

1250
01:05:42,800 --> 01:05:44,358
Woo! Well, I'm gonna get off.

1251
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:46,391
Past my bedtime and there's a...

1252
01:05:46,440 --> 01:05:48,829
I've got to tape summat on aardvarks.

1253
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:51,110
- You're not going, are you?
Woody, stay.

1254
01:05:51,160 --> 01:05:53,116
- Are you coming, Milk?
- Yeah, mate.

1255
01:05:53,160 --> 01:05:55,037
Please, Woods, man, don't go.

1256
01:05:55,080 --> 01:05:57,514
Oh, no, it's nothing personal
with you, mate.

1257
01:05:57,560 --> 01:05:59,312
I'm just gonna get off.

1258
01:05:59,360 --> 01:06:02,272
Come on, Wood. Fucking hell,
I've brought booze and everything.

1259
01:06:02,320 --> 01:06:03,719
Can't we bury the hatchet?

1260
01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:07,070
I know what you've come for, man.
I'd rather get off, like.

1261
01:06:07,120 --> 01:06:10,669
It's this thing on aardvarks,
I'm really eager to watch it.

1262
01:06:10,720 --> 01:06:13,951
Come on, then, let's have you.
Come on, let's have you, folks.

1263
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,594
You have a good birthday, you,
all right, lovey?

1264
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:18,471
Sorry to be missioning it off.

1265
01:06:19,440 --> 01:06:20,919
Nice one, mate.

1266
01:06:20,960 --> 01:06:22,678
You look after yourself, you.

1267
01:06:22,720 --> 01:06:24,631
- Bye, Woody.
- See you, Tubby.

1268
01:06:24,680 --> 01:06:25,954
Bye, Milky.

1269
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:27,718
- Bye, Pob.
- See you later, folks.

1270
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:30,194
- Come on, Puke.
- See you later, Puke.

1271
01:06:31,240 --> 01:06:33,470
You're a twat, mate!
You're a fucking w...

1272
01:06:34,440 --> 01:06:36,158
See you later. Have a good night.

1273
01:06:36,200 --> 01:06:38,555
If only you knew.

1274
01:06:43,480 --> 01:06:45,232
Happy birthday, Smell.

1275
01:06:45,280 --> 01:06:47,157
- Smell!
- What's that?

1276
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:48,599
Porno?

1277
01:06:48,640 --> 01:06:50,790
What are you giving her porno for,
Meggy?

1278
01:06:50,840 --> 01:06:53,070
She's a woman.
She's got her own nipples.

1279
01:06:53,120 --> 01:06:54,838
I thought she might like it.

1280
01:06:54,880 --> 01:06:56,598
Smell, are you ready?

1281
01:06:56,680 --> 01:06:58,193
The er... magicians.

1282
01:06:58,240 --> 01:06:59,639
- Are you ready?
- Yeah.

1283
01:06:59,680 --> 01:07:01,955
Three... two... one.

1284
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:03,911
Alakazam! Yeah!

1285
01:07:03,960 --> 01:07:05,871
- Alaka... Alakazam.
- Alakazam.

1286
01:07:05,920 --> 01:07:07,319
Wahey!

1287
01:07:08,480 --> 01:07:10,391
Happy birthday, Smell.

1288
01:07:10,440 --> 01:07:11,953
Happy...

1289
01:07:12,920 --> 01:07:14,876
- Happy birthday.
- Thanks.

1290
01:07:14,920 --> 01:07:17,878
- Do you want me to put it on the table?
- Yeah, please.

1291
01:07:17,920 --> 01:07:21,469
- Here you are. Put that on the table.
- Cheers, love, thanks.

1292
01:07:21,520 --> 01:07:24,114
You don't mind us coming, do you, Smell?
It's just...

1293
01:07:24,160 --> 01:07:28,039
My little man, here, wanted to surprise you
on your birthday and all that.

1294
01:07:28,080 --> 01:07:29,593
Happy birthday, Smell.

1295
01:07:35,200 --> 01:07:37,111
Do you think my party's going all right?

1296
01:07:37,200 --> 01:07:38,792
It's been all right, yeah.

1297
01:07:38,840 --> 01:07:40,751
Better if Woody was here.

1298
01:07:40,800 --> 01:07:43,633
Yeah, I know, man.
I don't know why they left.

1299
01:07:43,680 --> 01:07:45,636
They just kind of got up and went.

1300
01:07:45,680 --> 01:07:48,558
I don't think Woody was standing
any of it from Combo.

1301
01:07:49,520 --> 01:07:53,115
I mean, I don't know what's going on
with those two,

1302
01:07:53,160 --> 01:07:55,037
but there's some real tension.

1303
01:07:55,080 --> 01:07:57,753
I can sense some real tension
between them.

1304
01:07:57,800 --> 01:07:59,711
Was you happy when you saw me?

1305
01:07:59,760 --> 01:08:00,988
Yeah.

1306
01:08:01,040 --> 01:08:03,110
I liked it when you gave me that cake.

1307
01:08:03,160 --> 01:08:04,878
I thought it was cool.

1308
01:08:04,920 --> 01:08:06,478
Did you make it?

1309
01:08:07,440 --> 01:08:08,395
Yeah.

1310
01:08:09,360 --> 01:08:11,237
- You didn't, did you?
- No.

1311
01:08:11,280 --> 01:08:12,759
I didn't think you did.

1312
01:08:12,800 --> 01:08:14,995
Did you buy it?

1313
01:08:15,040 --> 01:08:16,792
- Yeah.
- Yeah, you bought it.

1314
01:08:18,360 --> 01:08:20,590
But what did you think to the other night?

1315
01:08:21,680 --> 01:08:23,557
Yeah.

1316
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:26,831
Do you know what I'm on about?
In the shed and stuff.

1317
01:08:26,920 --> 01:08:28,433
Yeah, that was...

1318
01:08:28,480 --> 01:08:30,198
It was all right, yeah.

1319
01:08:30,240 --> 01:08:32,071
Did you not think much to it?

1320
01:08:32,120 --> 01:08:33,473
Oh, yeah.

1321
01:08:34,520 --> 01:08:36,238
It was really nice.

1322
01:08:36,320 --> 01:08:38,993
You know when I asked you
to suck my tits and stuff,

1323
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:41,955
I just thought
that you weren't that into it.

1324
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:45,470
I only didn't suck your tits
cos I've never done it before.

1325
01:08:45,520 --> 01:08:49,035
I thought you'd seen a pair of tits
in Germany or summat.

1326
01:08:49,080 --> 01:08:51,196
No, I've seen a pair of tits, but...

1327
01:08:51,240 --> 01:08:52,753
I didn't suck 'em.

1328
01:08:52,840 --> 01:08:53,829
Oh.

1329
01:08:55,960 --> 01:08:57,109
Right.

1330
01:08:57,880 --> 01:09:01,236
That's why then, isn't it?
It's not cos you didn't want to or anything?

1331
01:09:01,280 --> 01:09:02,679
Yeah, I just...

1332
01:09:02,720 --> 01:09:05,518
Cos I bet you've had
loads of boys doing it and...

1333
01:09:06,440 --> 01:09:08,829
I felt a bit embarrassed
just in case I couldn't do it.

1334
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:09,835
Yeah.

1335
01:09:09,920 --> 01:09:12,434
Not that many people have done it to me.

1336
01:09:12,480 --> 01:09:14,391
I just thought it'd be nice, like.

1337
01:09:14,440 --> 01:09:16,351
It'd make us feel closer and stuff.

1338
01:09:17,400 --> 01:09:18,799
I was...

1339
01:09:18,840 --> 01:09:20,512
meaning to ask you.

1340
01:09:22,200 --> 01:09:25,476
This might seem a bit daft,
but will you be my girlfriend?

1341
01:09:26,760 --> 01:09:28,352
Honestly?

1342
01:09:31,480 --> 01:09:33,436
Yeah, I'd love to be.

1343
01:09:33,480 --> 01:09:35,118
It'd be really nice.

1344
01:09:35,160 --> 01:09:38,789
Cos I've been thinking about it, as well,
but I didn't think you'd ever ask me.

1345
01:09:38,840 --> 01:09:43,197
I thought it'd just be, like, a one time,
off in the shed or whatever.

1346
01:09:43,240 --> 01:09:44,912
Will you be all right for...

1347
01:09:44,960 --> 01:09:47,394
them lot to know,
if you're not embarrassed?

1348
01:09:48,360 --> 01:09:50,271
Cos I'm not embarrassed.

1349
01:09:50,320 --> 01:09:51,833
I think you're lovely.

1350
01:09:57,960 --> 01:10:02,033
<i>to maintain peace,
with freedom and justice is always expensive.</i>

1351
01:10:02,080 --> 01:10:05,436
<i>It's less expensive than war,
particularly in human life.</i>

1352
01:10:05,480 --> 01:10:09,109
<i>Might there be a time when we talk
to the Argentines again?</i>

1353
01:10:09,160 --> 01:10:11,879
<i>No. Not on sovereignty.</i>

1354
01:10:11,920 --> 01:10:14,639
<i>One thing...the islanders
have made it perfectly clear,</i>

1355
01:10:14,680 --> 01:10:16,318
<i>these islands are British.</i>

1356
01:10:16,360 --> 01:10:18,999
<i>They are the Queen's loyal subjects.</i>

1357
01:10:19,040 --> 01:10:20,951
<i>They wish it to stay that way.</i>

1358
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:24,072
<i>At least the weather's been on
Mrs Thatcher's side...</i>

1359
01:10:34,200 --> 01:10:36,714
- Lol.
- For fuck's sake.

1360
01:10:36,760 --> 01:10:38,478
Where are you off? Court?

1361
01:10:38,520 --> 01:10:39,669
No. I...

1362
01:10:39,720 --> 01:10:41,597
- What do you want?
- I wanna talk to you.

1363
01:10:41,640 --> 01:10:43,710
- Well, I'm late for work.
- Just two minutes?

1364
01:10:43,760 --> 01:10:45,830
- I haven't got two minutes.
- All right, Lol?

1365
01:10:45,880 --> 01:10:47,598
- You all right?
- Yeah.

1366
01:10:47,640 --> 01:10:49,198
- Hi, Lol.
- Hiya.

1367
01:10:49,240 --> 01:10:51,037
For fu... I'm going to work.

1368
01:10:51,080 --> 01:10:53,992
- Please, Lol. Two minutes.
- What do you wanna talk to me about?

1369
01:10:54,040 --> 01:10:55,678
- Stuff.
- Stuff?

1370
01:10:55,720 --> 01:10:58,871
- You wanna talk to me about stuff?
- I just wanna have a chat with you.

1371
01:10:58,920 --> 01:11:01,115
About the fact you've just
come out of prison?

1372
01:11:01,160 --> 01:11:04,072
You've ruined everything?
You've broken Woody's fucking heart?

1373
01:11:04,120 --> 01:11:07,430
You wanna talk to me about stuff?
Well, I can't fucking wait. Let's go.

1374
01:11:07,480 --> 01:11:09,277
I want to talk about other stuff.

1375
01:11:09,320 --> 01:11:12,630
Other stuff? What other stuff
have you possibly got to say to me?

1376
01:11:12,680 --> 01:11:14,750
Could I just have fucking two minutes
with you?

1377
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:17,712
No, I'm going to work.
I'm not your fucking counsellor, Combo.

1378
01:11:17,760 --> 01:11:20,752
- I'll come back at dinner time, then.
- No, don't come back.

1379
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:22,631
I'll come to yours later on.

1380
01:11:22,680 --> 01:11:24,910
To mine?
You can have two minutes now.

1381
01:11:24,960 --> 01:11:26,678
You've got two fucking minutes.

1382
01:11:26,720 --> 01:11:28,233
OK. Sound.

1383
01:11:40,040 --> 01:11:42,508
Come on, then. I'm late for work.

1384
01:11:47,240 --> 01:11:49,629
There's something for you
in the glove box.

1385
01:11:58,640 --> 01:11:59,993
A box.

1386
01:12:01,920 --> 01:12:03,831
You make this when you was in prison?

1387
01:12:03,880 --> 01:12:04,869
Yeah.

1388
01:12:07,280 --> 01:12:08,633
Thanks.

1389
01:12:12,840 --> 01:12:14,159
Lol...

1390
01:12:15,200 --> 01:12:16,155
Erm...

1391
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:21,194
Since that night that we spent together,

1392
01:12:21,240 --> 01:12:23,310
before I went inside...

1393
01:12:24,280 --> 01:12:27,033
...I haven't been able to think about
anything else.

1394
01:12:28,200 --> 01:12:29,553
No, I haven't.

1395
01:12:29,600 --> 01:12:31,989
I haven't been able
to get you out of my mind, man.

1396
01:12:33,480 --> 01:12:35,391
And, to be honest with you, Lol...

1397
01:12:36,360 --> 01:12:38,112
...just thinking of you...

1398
01:12:39,160 --> 01:12:41,799
...got me through
them three and a half years inside.

1399
01:12:43,160 --> 01:12:44,513
I mean...

1400
01:12:45,480 --> 01:12:47,391
That was the best night of my life.

1401
01:12:49,320 --> 01:12:51,231
It was the worst night of my life.

1402
01:12:53,160 --> 01:12:54,388
Why?

1403
01:12:54,440 --> 01:12:57,955
I have done nothing but try and forget
about that night, Combo.

1404
01:13:00,360 --> 01:13:02,078
It was... It was beautiful.

1405
01:13:02,120 --> 01:13:03,678
No, I was 16.

1406
01:13:03,720 --> 01:13:05,790
I was pissed off my head.

1407
01:13:06,760 --> 01:13:08,512
It wasn't beautiful.

1408
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:13,433
I love you, Lol.

1409
01:13:14,480 --> 01:13:15,435
What?

1410
01:13:19,320 --> 01:13:20,548
I've...

1411
01:13:21,880 --> 01:13:23,598
I've always loved you.

1412
01:13:24,640 --> 01:13:26,551
It's never gonna happen, Combo.

1413
01:13:35,440 --> 01:13:36,998
Are we done?

1414
01:13:37,040 --> 01:13:37,995
Yeah.

1415
01:13:42,240 --> 01:13:43,753
There's your box.

1416
01:14:17,280 --> 01:14:19,316
Pressure Drop

1417
01:14:24,680 --> 01:14:26,238
# Pressure

1418
01:14:26,280 --> 01:14:27,918
# Oh, pressure

1419
01:14:27,960 --> 01:14:29,871
# Pressure's gonna drop on you

1420
01:14:29,920 --> 01:14:31,831
Why do they call you Smell?

1421
01:14:32,840 --> 01:14:36,150
It's kind of similar to Michelle,
if you think about it.

1422
01:14:36,200 --> 01:14:39,078
I don't know, really,
if I'm being honest with you.

1423
01:14:39,120 --> 01:14:41,475
- Ah, that's fine.
- It's not cos I'm smelly.

1424
01:14:41,520 --> 01:14:43,829
It's just Michelle and Smell.

1425
01:14:43,880 --> 01:14:45,791
- Right.
- Purely cos it rhymes.

1426
01:14:45,840 --> 01:14:48,593
Well, it sort of rhymes, doesn't it?
Does it rhyme?

1427
01:14:48,680 --> 01:14:50,079
R for Rectum.

1428
01:14:51,040 --> 01:14:52,359
Rabbit.

1429
01:14:53,320 --> 01:14:55,231
Rub your rectum.

1430
01:14:55,280 --> 01:14:57,748
- Oh, rabbit, you said, yeah?
- Yeah.

1431
01:14:57,800 --> 01:14:59,472
Furry rectum.

1432
01:14:59,520 --> 01:15:01,750
Do you reckon
they've got a cassette player?

1433
01:15:02,720 --> 01:15:04,233
- Yeah, probably.
- Really?

1434
01:15:04,280 --> 01:15:06,191
- Yeah, probably.
- Oh, I hope so.

1435
01:15:06,240 --> 01:15:08,276
Let's bang some music into their ears.

1436
01:15:08,320 --> 01:15:09,833
That'll be good.

1437
01:15:14,200 --> 01:15:16,509
- Is this it?
- Yeah, I can walk straight in.

1438
01:15:17,160 --> 01:15:18,434
Combo!

1439
01:15:20,200 --> 01:15:21,918
That was nice, that was.

1440
01:15:21,960 --> 01:15:23,837
Yeah, well, you know.

1441
01:15:23,880 --> 01:15:25,438
I do what I do.

1442
01:15:26,400 --> 01:15:27,719
You do!

1443
01:15:27,760 --> 01:15:29,193
Oh, fuck.

1444
01:15:30,080 --> 01:15:31,991
- What's he doing?
- I don't know.

1445
01:15:32,040 --> 01:15:34,235
- All right, Milks?
- What are you saying, mate?

1446
01:15:34,280 --> 01:15:35,713
How are you doing?

1447
01:15:35,760 --> 01:15:36,715
Sound.

1448
01:15:36,760 --> 01:15:38,398
What have you two been up to?

1449
01:15:38,440 --> 01:15:40,590
You know how it is, having a bit of fun.

1450
01:15:44,960 --> 01:15:46,678
What's up, mate?

1451
01:15:47,640 --> 01:15:48,959
You look down.

1452
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:50,911
One of them days.
You know what I mean?

1453
01:15:51,880 --> 01:15:53,233
Look, man, erm...

1454
01:15:54,200 --> 01:15:55,758
Any chance you can get me any weed?

1455
01:15:56,680 --> 01:15:59,069
I just want a smoke.
You know what I mean?

1456
01:15:59,880 --> 01:16:02,440
I mean, I've only got, like,
one spliff left on me.

1457
01:16:02,480 --> 01:16:04,391
I can't really give that away.

1458
01:16:04,440 --> 01:16:07,034
- What were you after?
- About an ounce or summat.

1459
01:16:07,080 --> 01:16:08,479
Fucking hell.

1460
01:16:08,520 --> 01:16:09,919
No, mate, no.

1461
01:16:09,960 --> 01:16:12,428
I couldn't get anything like that big, no way.

1462
01:16:12,480 --> 01:16:15,677
I mean, I'll give you half, I'll split it.
Give you half of it.

1463
01:16:16,680 --> 01:16:18,591
Well, I mean, I might be able to...

1464
01:16:19,560 --> 01:16:21,278
...to get... get like that much.

1465
01:16:21,320 --> 01:16:22,673
What?

1466
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:24,955
What?

1467
01:16:25,720 --> 01:16:27,631
I thought you were gonna
walk me home.

1468
01:16:27,680 --> 01:16:31,229
You can be there in, like, 15 minutes,
if you get a move on now.

1469
01:16:32,280 --> 01:16:34,191
You're only a mile down the road.

1470
01:16:34,240 --> 01:16:35,798
Are you joking?

1471
01:16:35,840 --> 01:16:36,795
What?

1472
01:16:37,960 --> 01:16:40,520
Oh, fuck you, you selfish bastard.

1473
01:16:44,880 --> 01:16:46,438
Fuckin' hell, man.

1474
01:16:47,720 --> 01:16:49,438
Women!

1475
01:16:51,240 --> 01:16:53,151
Ooh-ooh-ooh!

1476
01:16:53,200 --> 01:16:54,758
Watch it.

1477
01:16:54,800 --> 01:16:56,916
- Banjo for a banjo.
- Yeah.

1478
01:16:59,600 --> 01:17:00,555
Ah.

1479
01:17:00,600 --> 01:17:02,158
Ooh-ooh-ooh!

1480
01:17:02,200 --> 01:17:04,111
- Come on, Smell.
Oh, no.

1481
01:17:04,160 --> 01:17:07,516
- Come on.
- Oh, God! It's gonna keel over!

1482
01:17:07,560 --> 01:17:09,073
Wait for it.

1483
01:17:12,320 --> 01:17:14,231
- Kick Donkey!
- Two sugars.

1484
01:17:14,280 --> 01:17:15,633
Kick Donkey.

1485
01:17:15,680 --> 01:17:19,116
I'm not making tea.
Kick Donkey, Kick Donkey...

1486
01:17:26,480 --> 01:17:28,391
Anyone got a problem?

1487
01:17:28,440 --> 01:17:29,839
No problem.

1488
01:17:33,320 --> 01:17:35,231
No. Problem with what, man?

1489
01:17:36,600 --> 01:17:39,068
Good to see you, Milk.
Are you all right, mate?

1490
01:17:39,800 --> 01:17:41,472
All right, Tubbs.

1491
01:17:43,200 --> 01:17:44,713
Is Woody on his way?

1492
01:17:44,760 --> 01:17:46,273
No. Just Milky.

1493
01:17:48,320 --> 01:17:50,914
- All right, Milks?
- Are you all right, mate?

1494
01:18:08,200 --> 01:18:09,519
No problem.

1495
01:18:10,560 --> 01:18:12,198
Sit down, Milks.

1496
01:18:15,480 --> 01:18:16,879
That's good.

1497
01:18:17,840 --> 01:18:19,751
That means we can all get stoned.

1498
01:18:22,400 --> 01:18:25,437
# At the dark end...

1499
01:18:25,480 --> 01:18:26,993
A chocolate bassline.

1500
01:18:27,040 --> 01:18:28,951
# Of the street...

1501
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:30,718
All velvet.

1502
01:18:30,760 --> 01:18:34,833
# That's where we always meet...

1503
01:18:34,880 --> 01:18:36,791
Combo. My dancing buddy.

1504
01:18:36,840 --> 01:18:39,638
# Hiding in shadows

1505
01:18:39,680 --> 01:18:42,638
# Where we don't belong

1506
01:18:44,360 --> 01:18:49,434
# Living in darkness
to hide our wrong...

1507
01:18:51,080 --> 01:18:52,991
# You and me...

1508
01:18:53,080 --> 01:18:54,672
Sit, Mitzy, sit.

1509
01:18:55,640 --> 01:18:59,679
# At the dark end of the street...

1510
01:18:59,720 --> 01:19:01,119
I'm hot, I'm hot!

1511
01:19:01,160 --> 01:19:03,549
# You and me...

1512
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:05,955
Ow!

1513
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:10,391
# I know time's gonna take its toll...

1514
01:19:11,360 --> 01:19:13,112
Are you all right, Gads?

1515
01:19:13,160 --> 01:19:15,549
# We have to pay for the love...

1516
01:19:15,600 --> 01:19:18,114
Take him home, love. He looks fucked.

1517
01:19:20,360 --> 01:19:22,669
# It's a sin and we know...

1518
01:19:22,720 --> 01:19:24,358
It's all right, Gadge, lad.

1519
01:19:25,320 --> 01:19:27,311
Have you fucking seen how white he is!

1520
01:19:27,360 --> 01:19:29,874
I've never seen anyone
look that fucking sick!

1521
01:19:30,840 --> 01:19:32,751
That fucking kid's arse went white!

1522
01:19:33,720 --> 01:19:35,631
#... steal away...

1523
01:19:36,600 --> 01:19:37,828
Come on.

1524
01:19:37,880 --> 01:19:40,155
# To the dark end

1525
01:19:40,200 --> 01:19:42,236
# Of the street...

1526
01:19:42,280 --> 01:19:43,554
Oh, man.

1527
01:19:43,600 --> 01:19:45,033
Here you are.

1528
01:19:45,120 --> 01:19:46,951
No, seriously, Combo, man.

1529
01:19:48,040 --> 01:19:51,191
I've got to tell you, mate,
you're a good geezer, man.

1530
01:19:51,240 --> 01:19:53,549
Seriously. I mean, this... this music,

1531
01:19:53,600 --> 01:19:58,594
this sort of music is the sort of stuff
that I listen to, my uncles listen to.

1532
01:19:58,640 --> 01:20:01,359
Yeah, to me, this is good music.

1533
01:20:01,440 --> 01:20:05,911
What you've gotta remember, Milks,
right, is... is I'm an original skinhead.

1534
01:20:05,960 --> 01:20:07,393
'69, me.

1535
01:20:07,440 --> 01:20:12,195
But it was people like your uncle,
your uncle that introduced that stuff to me.

1536
01:20:12,240 --> 01:20:15,312
The soul of that music
just fucking resonated within us,

1537
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:16,952
do you know what I mean?

1538
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:20,788
And it's people... it's skinheads, like you,
true skinheads, like you,

1539
01:20:20,840 --> 01:20:22,558
keeping that flame alive.

1540
01:20:22,600 --> 01:20:24,716
Yeah. It was fucking unity.

1541
01:20:24,760 --> 01:20:27,320
It was black and white, together.
Know what I mean?

1542
01:20:27,360 --> 01:20:29,749
It should not be forgotten.
It shouldn't die.

1543
01:20:29,800 --> 01:20:33,315
You're still flying that flag in that fucking
get-out that you're wearing.

1544
01:20:33,360 --> 01:20:34,713
It's proper.

1545
01:20:34,760 --> 01:20:36,159
It's real, man.

1546
01:20:36,200 --> 01:20:37,474
Oh, man.

1547
01:20:38,440 --> 01:20:41,000
That's it, man,
we're like brothers now. Yeah?

1548
01:20:41,040 --> 01:20:42,075
Serious.

1549
01:20:42,960 --> 01:20:44,871
- For life.
- Yeah, for life.

1550
01:20:44,920 --> 01:20:46,399
Nice one, Combo.

1551
01:20:46,440 --> 01:20:47,919
Hand the spliff over.

1552
01:20:47,960 --> 01:20:50,633
I haven't had a laugh like this
for fucking years.

1553
01:20:50,680 --> 01:20:51,999
- Serious.
- For years.

1554
01:20:52,040 --> 01:20:54,156
Here you are. It's been a long time.

1555
01:20:56,440 --> 01:20:58,351
I want some chocolate.

1556
01:21:02,800 --> 01:21:06,076
- There's biscuits in the cupboard.
- Not in that cupboard.

1557
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,116
No, not in that cupboard. I'm starving!

1558
01:21:10,160 --> 01:21:13,516
How can you fucking live like this?
There's not even a mouldy Twiglet.

1559
01:21:14,600 --> 01:21:17,910
I'm really starving, man.
I've got the munchies badly.

1560
01:21:17,960 --> 01:21:20,633
- Combo, have you eaten the biscuits?
- No.

1561
01:21:20,680 --> 01:21:23,353
- Fucking hell.
What a night.

1562
01:21:25,720 --> 01:21:27,631
So, how many uncles have you got?

1563
01:21:27,680 --> 01:21:28,874
Erm...

1564
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:33,197
I've got three uncles and two aunties.

1565
01:21:33,240 --> 01:21:34,832
So, a big family, then.

1566
01:21:34,880 --> 01:21:35,869
Yeah.

1567
01:21:36,880 --> 01:21:40,555
I've got... What is it? 22 cousins.

1568
01:21:42,480 --> 01:21:44,948
One uncle's got, what, seven kids.

1569
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:46,911
What, to the same woman, like?

1570
01:21:46,960 --> 01:21:48,188
Nah.

1571
01:21:48,240 --> 01:21:50,629
Spread out
between three different women.

1572
01:21:50,680 --> 01:21:54,753
One's got two, the other's got two,
and another one's got three kids.

1573
01:21:54,800 --> 01:21:57,758
And he just, like,
left these families and fucked off?

1574
01:21:57,800 --> 01:22:00,234
Nah, he still sees 'em.

1575
01:22:00,280 --> 01:22:02,635
Yeah, to me,
he still spends time with them.

1576
01:22:02,680 --> 01:22:07,276
They're always round at Christmas
and stuff like that. We all get together.

1577
01:22:07,320 --> 01:22:09,515
A big party till late in the morning.

1578
01:22:11,280 --> 01:22:13,191
Yeah, it's... it's nice.

1579
01:22:13,240 --> 01:22:15,913
It is. It's nice having a big family.

1580
01:22:15,960 --> 01:22:17,598
Have you got a mum and dad?

1581
01:22:17,640 --> 01:22:19,915
Cos you haven't talked about
your mum or dad.

1582
01:22:20,960 --> 01:22:22,757
Yeah, I've got a mum and dad.

1583
01:22:22,800 --> 01:22:24,199
Of course, man.

1584
01:22:24,280 --> 01:22:26,953
A good mum and dad.
Yeah, I can't knock 'em at all.

1585
01:22:27,640 --> 01:22:32,191
I was one of them kids where...
my dad was away all the time.

1586
01:22:32,240 --> 01:22:35,232
Sometimes he was away for, like,
a fortnight, working.

1587
01:22:35,280 --> 01:22:36,315
But...

1588
01:22:37,280 --> 01:22:41,273
I never blamed my dad or anything
like that for him being away and working.

1589
01:22:41,320 --> 01:22:42,275
Cos...

1590
01:22:42,320 --> 01:22:44,675
there was always food on that table.

1591
01:22:44,720 --> 01:22:47,029
That's what I respect that man for.

1592
01:22:47,080 --> 01:22:48,399
Always.

1593
01:22:50,320 --> 01:22:52,231
Lucky you, aren't you?

1594
01:22:52,320 --> 01:22:53,753
I tell you...

1595
01:22:53,800 --> 01:22:55,711
you know, any, any time...

1596
01:22:56,680 --> 01:22:58,796
...you wanna come round
for something to eat,

1597
01:22:58,840 --> 01:23:01,718
you have to come to my grandma's
to get something to eat.

1598
01:23:01,760 --> 01:23:03,398
- Yeah?
- Yeah, man.

1599
01:23:03,440 --> 01:23:06,512
She'll cook some rice.
She'll cook some peas.

1600
01:23:06,560 --> 01:23:08,710
She'll cook some chicken.

1601
01:23:08,760 --> 01:23:10,716
She sounds dead lovely, don't she?

1602
01:23:10,760 --> 01:23:14,036
Serious, man, then you come home
for some ackee and swordfish.

1603
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:16,718
That'd be nice, wouldn't it?

1604
01:23:16,760 --> 01:23:18,478
Ah, seriously, man, cos...

1605
01:23:18,520 --> 01:23:23,196
I'd love for you to do that.
I'd love for you to do that. That'd be nice.

1606
01:23:23,240 --> 01:23:27,518
Serious, come and see how we...
how we live. Know what I mean?

1607
01:23:27,560 --> 01:23:30,120
Even on a bad day,
there'll probably be...

1608
01:23:30,160 --> 01:23:32,390
a couple of my uncles
and about seven...

1609
01:23:32,440 --> 01:23:34,908
Fucking hell.
You've got everything, haven't you?

1610
01:23:34,960 --> 01:23:36,712
- What?
- You've got the whole lot.

1611
01:23:37,720 --> 01:23:39,870
You've got the whole fucking
perfect package.

1612
01:23:41,160 --> 01:23:42,479
Fucking hell.

1613
01:23:44,240 --> 01:23:45,912
Got everything, you, didn't you?

1614
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:50,149
Fucking hell, man. So...

1615
01:23:51,440 --> 01:23:54,273
What... What do you think
makes a bad dad?

1616
01:23:56,760 --> 01:23:59,399
I don't know, mate. I'm not a dad, am I?

1617
01:24:01,120 --> 01:24:03,031
I know you had a good dad, like, but,

1618
01:24:03,080 --> 01:24:07,278
be honest with me, what do you really think
makes a bad dad, though?

1619
01:24:07,320 --> 01:24:09,117
I don't know, man.

1620
01:24:09,160 --> 01:24:11,071
What's with the questions, man?

1621
01:24:11,120 --> 01:24:13,350
I feel like I'm being interrogated.

1622
01:24:16,520 --> 01:24:18,556
What do you reckon?

1623
01:24:19,520 --> 01:24:20,475
Niggers.

1624
01:24:23,200 --> 01:24:26,078
- What's with the "nigger"?
- Because you are, aren't you?

1625
01:24:26,120 --> 01:24:28,509
You're a fucking nigger. Aren't you?

1626
01:24:31,600 --> 01:24:32,828
Aren't you?

1627
01:24:34,120 --> 01:24:35,997
Fucking coon.

1628
01:24:36,040 --> 01:24:38,270
Combo! Just leave him.

1629
01:24:41,640 --> 01:24:42,959
Go on.

1630
01:24:45,480 --> 01:24:47,391
Don't fucking smile at me.

1631
01:24:47,440 --> 01:24:48,998
Don't smile at me.

1632
01:24:49,040 --> 01:24:50,917
Milky, just stop smiling at him, please.

1633
01:24:50,960 --> 01:24:55,192
Don't fucking smile at me, cos I'll wipe
the fucking smile off your fucking face.

1634
01:24:55,240 --> 01:24:56,878
Yeah? You fucking cunt!

1635
01:24:57,440 --> 01:24:59,795
No!
- Fucking horrible...

1636
01:24:59,840 --> 01:25:02,479
Fucking bastard!

1637
01:25:04,280 --> 01:25:06,748
I fucking hate you! I fucking hate you!

1638
01:25:06,800 --> 01:25:08,916
- I fucking hate you!
Get off!

1639
01:25:08,960 --> 01:25:10,393
Milky!

1640
01:25:10,440 --> 01:25:12,954
- No, Combo, get off him!
- You fucking black bastard!

1641
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:15,991
I fucking hate you! I fucking hate you.

1642
01:25:16,040 --> 01:25:18,156
I fucking hate you! You fucking nigger!

1643
01:25:18,240 --> 01:25:19,639
- You fucking nigger!
- Milky!

1644
01:25:19,680 --> 01:25:22,319
Fuck off! Fuck off!

1645
01:25:22,360 --> 01:25:24,635
Combo!

1646
01:25:24,680 --> 01:25:25,590
Milky!

1647
01:25:25,640 --> 01:25:27,676
Milky, man, are you all right?

1648
01:25:27,720 --> 01:25:28,948
Shut up!

1649
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:31,514
Shut the fuck up
and get the fuck out now!

1650
01:25:31,560 --> 01:25:33,278
You little fucking cunt.

1651
01:25:33,320 --> 01:25:35,629
Fuck off, you little bastard!

1652
01:25:35,720 --> 01:25:38,553
- I thought you was winding us up.
- What are you doing, boys?

1653
01:25:38,600 --> 01:25:41,876
Fucking all day
we've sat and listened to him.

1654
01:25:41,920 --> 01:25:43,558
I want some of this. We want our bit.

1655
01:25:43,600 --> 01:25:44,953
This man?

1656
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:46,911
- Aargh!
- You fucking mad cunt!

1657
01:25:46,960 --> 01:25:49,713
You knobhead!
You fucking horrible fucking cunt!

1658
01:25:49,760 --> 01:25:52,513
You're fucking mad as a March hare.
What's wrong with you?

1659
01:25:52,600 --> 01:25:54,352
Fucking leave them alone!

1660
01:25:54,400 --> 01:25:56,960
- Do you want it, as well?
- You're fucking potty.

1661
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:59,195
What? Fuck off, you fucking dickhead!

1662
01:25:59,240 --> 01:26:02,391
I'll fucking throttle you,
you fucking fat piece of shit!

1663
01:26:02,440 --> 01:26:05,796
Get the fuck out of here,
you fucking goggle-eyed twat!

1664
01:26:06,920 --> 01:26:08,672
Get out. Get out.

1665
01:26:08,720 --> 01:26:11,314
- You need to fucking see someone.
- Get out.

1666
01:26:11,360 --> 01:26:13,271
I said, get out. I said, get out.

1667
01:26:13,320 --> 01:26:14,275
Milky...

1668
01:26:14,320 --> 01:26:17,596
Leave them alone, will you?
They haven't done nothing to you.

1669
01:26:17,640 --> 01:26:19,517
Fucking leave them two alone.

1670
01:26:19,560 --> 01:26:20,993
Leave them alone.

1671
01:26:21,040 --> 01:26:23,508
They've done...
They've done nothing to you.

1672
01:26:23,560 --> 01:26:24,913
You fuck...

1673
01:26:26,600 --> 01:26:27,510
Ah!

1674
01:26:29,160 --> 01:26:30,878
No-o-o!

1675
01:26:37,680 --> 01:26:39,238
Fucking hell.

1676
01:26:39,280 --> 01:26:40,679
I'm sorry.

1677
01:26:40,720 --> 01:26:42,631
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1678
01:26:43,320 --> 01:26:44,992
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1679
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,389
Oh, Combo,
what have you done to him?

1680
01:26:50,440 --> 01:26:52,158
Oh, my God!

1681
01:26:52,200 --> 01:26:53,713
No, no, no!

1682
01:26:56,760 --> 01:26:57,715
Milky?

1683
01:26:57,760 --> 01:26:59,273
Wake up, Milky!

1684
01:26:59,320 --> 01:27:00,719
He's OK.

1685
01:27:00,760 --> 01:27:02,432
Milky, wake up!

1686
01:27:02,480 --> 01:27:04,789
Hey, what am I gonna do?
What am I gonna do?

1687
01:27:06,120 --> 01:27:08,350
It's not my fault. I didn't mean it.

1688
01:27:09,320 --> 01:27:11,311
I didn't mean it, I didn't mean it.

1689
01:27:12,200 --> 01:27:14,236
- Milky, wake up!
- Help me get him...

1690
01:27:14,280 --> 01:27:16,350
- Wake up!
- Help me get him to hospital.

1691
01:27:16,400 --> 01:27:18,868
- Help me get him to hospital.
- Get off! Milky!

1692
01:27:18,920 --> 01:27:20,876
Come on, now. Stop it, now.

1693
01:27:20,920 --> 01:27:23,992
Stop the crying.
The crying stops now. You don't cry.

1694
01:27:24,040 --> 01:27:25,758
Real men don't cry.

1695
01:27:25,800 --> 01:27:28,075
Help me get him to the hospital, OK?

1696
01:27:28,120 --> 01:27:29,633
Come on. Let's go.

1697
01:27:29,680 --> 01:27:31,636
Come on, Shaun. Come on. Let's go.

1698
01:27:31,680 --> 01:27:33,193
Come on. Come on.

1699
01:27:46,440 --> 01:27:48,351
OK. Come on. Come on.

1700
01:27:48,400 --> 01:27:50,311
Help me. Help me. Stop crying!

1701
01:27:50,360 --> 01:27:52,032
Don't look at his face.

1702
01:27:52,080 --> 01:27:54,548
Don't look at his face.
Don't look at his face.

1703
01:27:54,600 --> 01:27:56,318
Don't look at his face.

1704
01:30:14,280 --> 01:30:15,269
Shaun?

1705
01:30:17,800 --> 01:30:19,279
Can I come in?

1706
01:30:20,360 --> 01:30:21,509
Yeah.

1707
01:30:33,760 --> 01:30:35,671
It's my favourite picture of Dad.

1708
01:30:38,280 --> 01:30:39,633
Me too.

1709
01:30:43,800 --> 01:30:45,233
And that one.

1710
01:30:46,440 --> 01:30:48,317
Mm, yeah, that's really nice.

1711
01:30:48,360 --> 01:30:50,396
You really look alike on that one.

1712
01:30:56,400 --> 01:30:59,039
Do you remember where we were
in that one?

1713
01:31:03,080 --> 01:31:04,069
Where?

1714
01:31:04,120 --> 01:31:05,314
Goy Farms.

1715
01:31:06,280 --> 01:31:08,555
That was like the best holiday ever.

1716
01:31:23,800 --> 01:31:26,268
Milky's gonna be all right, Shaun,
I promise.

1717
01:31:34,360 --> 01:31:36,078
Shaun, are you OK?

1718
01:31:48,400 --> 01:31:49,628
Yeah.

1719
01:31:55,520 --> 01:31:58,432
Please Please Please
Let Me Get What I Want

1720
01:32:15,320 --> 01:32:17,470
# Good times, for a change

1721
01:32:21,600 --> 01:32:23,511
# See, the luck I've had

1722
01:32:24,520 --> 01:32:27,398
# Can make a good man turn bad

1723
01:32:30,800 --> 01:32:32,711
# So, please

1724
01:32:33,160 --> 01:32:34,718
# Please, please

1725
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:39,151
# Let me, let me, let me

1726
01:32:39,200 --> 01:32:41,111
# Let me

1727
01:32:42,400 --> 01:32:44,118
# Get what I want

1728
01:32:45,080 --> 01:32:46,479
# This time

1729
01:32:51,560 --> 01:32:53,471
# Get what I want

1730
01:32:56,520 --> 01:32:57,953
# This time

1731
01:33:07,960 --> 01:33:11,032
# Haven't had a dream in a long time

1732
01:33:14,880 --> 01:33:16,791
# See, the life I've had

1733
01:33:18,040 --> 01:33:20,713
# Can make a good man bad

1734
01:33:24,200 --> 01:33:26,111
# So

1735
01:33:26,160 --> 01:33:28,071
# For once in my life

1736
01:33:29,160 --> 01:33:30,593
# Let me

1737
01:33:31,240 --> 01:33:32,958
# Get what I want

1738
01:33:34,760 --> 01:33:36,955
# Lord knows

1739
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:39,275
# It would be the first time

1740
01:33:43,760 --> 01:33:48,231
# Lord knows, it would be the first time

1741
01:33:52,480 --> 01:33:54,869
# Lord knows

1742
01:33:54,920 --> 01:33:57,593
# It would be the first time

1743
01:34:01,440 --> 01:34:06,036
# Lord knows, it would be the first time

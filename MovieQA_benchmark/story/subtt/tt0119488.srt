1
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:27,158
<i>Come to Los Angeles.</i>

2
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:29,232
<i>The sun shines bright.</i>

3
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:31,516
<i>The beaches are wide and inviting.</i>

4
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:35,435
<i>And the orange groves stretch
as far as the eye can see.</i>

5
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:39,357
<i>There are jobs aplenty. Land is cheap.</i>

6
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,750
<i>Every workingman
can have his own house.</i>

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,152
<i>And inside every house,
a happy all-American family.</i>

8
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,716
<i>You can have all this, and who knows?</i>

9
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:51,391
<i>You could even be discovered...</i>

10
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:54,758
<i>...become a movie star,
or at least see one.</i>

11
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,270
<i>Life is good in Los Angeles.</i>

12
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,160
<i>It's paradise on earth.</i>

13
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,911
<i>That's what they tell you, anyway.</i>

14
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:05,878
<i>Because they're selling an image.</i>

15
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:09,556
<i>They're selling it through
movies, radio and television.</i>

16
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:13,509
<i>In the hit show, Badge of Honor,
the L.A. Cops walk on water...</i>

17
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,512
<i>...as they keep the city clean
of crooks.</i>

18
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,429
<i>You'd think this place
was the Garden of Eden.</i>

19
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,318
<i>But there's trouble in paradise...</i>

20
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,232
<i>...and his name is Meyer Harris Cohen,
Mickey C to his fans.</i>

21
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,029
<i>Local L.A. Color to the nth degree.</i>

22
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:31,391
<i>And his number one bodyguard...</i>

23
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:33,278
<i>...Johnny Stompanato.</i>

24
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,193
<i>Mickey C's the head of organized crime
in these parts.</i>

25
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:39,631
<i>He runs dope, rackets and prostitution.</i>

26
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:41,393
<i>He kills a dozen people a year.</i>

27
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,468
<i>And the dapper little gent
does it in style.</i>

28
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:47,674
<i>And every time his picture's
on the front page...</i>

29
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:50,799
<i>...it's a black eye for the
image of Los Angeles.</i>

30
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:53,594
<i>Because how can organized crime exist...</i>

31
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,798
<i>...in the city with the best
police force in the world?</i>

32
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,519
<i>Something has to be done.</i>

33
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:01,633
<i>But nothing too original
because this is Hollywood.</i>

34
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,830
<i>What worked for Capone
would work for the Mickster.</i>

35
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,672
Mr. Cohen, you're under arrest.

36
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:09,115
Non-payment of federal income tax.

37
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:13,195
<i>But all is not well. Sending Mickey up
has created a vacuum.</i>

38
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,078
<i>And it's only a matter of time...</i>

39
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:18,790
<i>...before someone with balls
of brass tries to fill it.</i>

40
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,509
Remember, dear readers...

41
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,953
...you heard it here first...

42
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,558
...off the record...

43
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,872
...on the q. T...

44
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,839
...and very...

45
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,798
<i>...Hush-Hush.</i>

46
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,357
You're like Santa Claus with that list.

47
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,790
Except everyone on it's been naughty.

48
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,556
Guy's been out of Q two weeks.

49
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,635
Leave it for later.

50
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:03,838
We got to pick up the booze
and get it to the station.

51
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,918
Hollywood, this is 6-Adam-7.

52
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:11,915
Have Central send a prowler
to 4216 Evergreen.

53
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:14,833
Parole violation: Assault arising
from a family dispute.

54
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,672
We won't be here but
they'll see him.

55
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,069
Quit your whining!

56
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:29,436
Quit whining all the time!
It makes me sick!

57
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,749
Shut up!

58
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,588
Who the hell are you?

59
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,871
The ghost of Christmas past.

60
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,199
Dance with a man for a change?

61
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,919
You a smart ass?

62
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:10,032
You'll be out in a year and a half.
I'll get cozy with your parole officer.

63
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:14,159
Touch her again, I'll have you
violated on a kiddie-raper beef.

64
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,274
You know what they do
to kiddie rapers in Quentin.

65
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,872
You got someplace you can go?

66
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,952
Go get yourself fixed up.

67
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,835
Merry Christmas.

68
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,875
- Merry Christmas, ma'am.
- Let's go, Bud.

69
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,314
The guys are waiting.

70
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,631
<i>What do you do on Badge of Honor?</i>

71
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,394
I'm the technical advisor.

72
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:54,837
I teach Brett Chase how to
walk and talk like a cop.

73
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,510
Brett Chase doesn't walk
and talk like you.

74
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,876
That's because he's the
television version.

75
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,470
America isn't ready for the real me.

76
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,314
Is it true you arrested Bob Mitchum?

77
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:10,358
<i>The Badge of Honor guys like to pretend,
but the real thing must be a thrill.</i>

78
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:14,633
Why don't we go someplace quiet?
I'll give you the lowdown on Mitchum.

79
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,110
Big V. Jack Vincennes.

80
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,192
- May I have this dance?
- Of course.

81
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,431
<i>This is Sid Hudgens,
Hush-Hush magazine.</i>

82
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,114
- Hello, Karen.
- Hello yourself.

83
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,709
What that's about?

84
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:30,316
Her name was in a piece we did,
"Ingenue Dikes in Hollywood. "

85
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,028
My friend just sold reefer
to Matt Reynolds.

86
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,238
He's tripping the light fantastic
with Tammy Jordan.

87
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,517
Sorry, I lost you for a second.

88
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:45,958
Contract players, Metro. Pinch them,
I do you up a nice feature next issue.

89
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,555
- Plus your usual $50 cash.
- I need another $50.

90
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:51,957
Two 20s for two patrolmen,
a dime for the watch commander.

91
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,394
It's Christmas.

92
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,868
No, it's not.

93
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:58,156
It's felony possession of marijuana.

94
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,910
Actually, it's circulation 36,000
and climbing.

95
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,879
There's no telling where this will go.
Radio, television...

96
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:09,869
Once you whet the public's appetite
for the truth, the sky's the limit.

97
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:17,673
Sgt. Ed Exley, son of the
legendary Preston Exley.

98
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,473
Must be a hard act to follow.

99
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:24,077
Why not make a mark elsewhere?
Why become a cop?

100
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,232
I like to help people.

101
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,914
We heard 2 officers
were assaulted this evening.

102
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,799
- What do you think of that?
- Goes with the job.

103
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,797
Luckily, they're okay.

104
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,871
Aren't you young to be
watch commander?

105
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:36,996
It's only tonight.

106
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,914
The married men have Christmas Eve off.

107
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,957
That's a good lead for the story.

108
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,633
Merry Christmas, Captain.

109
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,628
- Captain Smith.
- Drop the formalities, Bobby.

110
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,315
- It's Christmas Eve, call me Dudley.
- I got the story's title.

111
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:53,193
I'm calling it
"Silent Night with the LAPD."

112
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,833
That's grand.

113
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,598
Remember that's "Smith"
with an "S."

114
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,237
Thank you, Merry Christmas.

115
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,709
Hold on, lads.

116
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,154
Merry Christmas.

117
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,434
I saw the results
on the lieutenant's exam.

118
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,318
First out of 23.

119
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,190
What'll it be, then? Patrol Division?
Internal Affairs? What?

120
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,998
Detective Bureau.

121
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,313
You're a political animal.

122
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:32,472
You have the eye for human weakness,
but not the stomach.

123
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:35,709
You're wrong, sir.

124
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:39,475
Would you be willing to plant evidence
on a suspect you knew to be guilty...

125
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,472
...to insure an indictment?

126
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,676
- We've been over this.
- Yes or no?

127
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,829
Would you beat a confession
out of a suspect you knew to be guilty?

128
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:51,879
Would you shoot a hardened
criminal in the back...

129
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:55,112
...in order to offset the chance
that some lawyer...

130
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,319
Then for the love of God...

131
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,198
...don't be a detective.

132
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,954
Stick to assignments where you don't
have to make those choices.

133
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,431
Dudley, I know you mean well...

134
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:08,235
...but I don't need to do it
the way you did... or my father.

135
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,437
At least get rid of the glasses.

136
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,240
I can't think of a man
in the Bureau who wears them.

137
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:25,071
If I ever get held up,
you better be here.

138
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,915
Hi, Nick.

139
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,513
I need a delivery.

140
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,228
A case each of gin, rum, Scotch.

141
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,829
Sounds like a hell of a party.
Be right with you.

142
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,075
Merry Christmas.

143
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,717
Merry Christmas, Officer.

144
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,349
That obvious?

145
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,310
It's practically stamped
on your forehead.

146
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,355
There you go.

147
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,878
See what he wants, Buzz.

148
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,631
Get lost, why don't you?

149
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,716
Down!
Get your fucking head down.

150
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,678
I got a license for that.

151
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:08,434
Cut me some slack.
I used to be a cop.

152
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:10,591
"Leland Meeks"?
Never heard of you.

153
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,308
They call me Buzz.

154
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:16,551
I don't give a rat's ass.
Keep your head down.

155
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,518
And stay there... Buzz.

156
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,634
You okay?

157
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:23,990
She's fine.

158
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,714
I'm not asking you.

159
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:28,669
Who hit you?

160
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,797
It's not what you think.

161
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,075
What, then?

162
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:37,675
You got the wrong idea.
I'm fine.

163
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,190
But it's nice to know you care.

164
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:50,875
Drive safely.

165
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,755
What's going on?

166
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:58,635
You know him?

167
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,712
Yeah, I've seen him around.

168
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:03,999
He used to be a cop.

169
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:13,318
They're sitting in the dark,
goofing on the Christmas tree.

170
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,437
Put your camera right there.

171
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:19,798
When I walk out, get the
movie premiere in the background.

172
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:22,793
I like it, I like it.
"The Movie Premiere Pot Bust. "

173
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,873
I don't want those goddamn
floodlights of yours in my eyes.

174
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:28,588
Consider it done.
You hear that, Chip?

175
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,996
Come on. Get down.

176
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:35,636
Go! Pop them!

177
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,109
Freeze! Police!

178
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,115
Jesus Christ!

179
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,590
Come on.
Come on, let's go.

180
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:46,909
My family's coming...

181
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:50,277
- It'll be a nice Christmas gift.
- Hi, Tammy. Hi, Matt.

182
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:51,475
Over here.

183
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,597
- Just turn.
- Hold it. Got it!

184
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:58,513
- The Movie Premiere Pot Bust!
- Take them. I'll get the evidence.

185
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:12,715
"It's Christmas Eve
in the City of Angels.

186
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:15,952
And while decent citizens sleep
the sleep of the righteous...

187
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,792
...hopheads prowl for marijuana...

188
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:21,911
...not knowing that a man
is coming to stop them:

189
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,508
Celebrity crime-stopper, Jack Vincennes.

190
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:29,839
Scourge of grasshoppers
and dope fiends everywhere. "

191
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,476
You like it?

192
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,269
Yeah, subtle.

193
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:37,630
What took you?

194
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:40,758
My partner stopped
to help a damsel in distress.

195
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,911
His priorities are all screwed up.

196
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:45,357
Up to your old tricks again?

197
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:50,549
Hollywood Jack, what brings you
to our humble station house?

198
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,358
What are you doing here?

199
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:54,471
You know, keeping the streets safe.

200
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,029
Get these two dressed
and book them.

201
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:59,788
- The party's upstairs.
- I'll be right up.

202
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:06,710
What's that for?

203
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:09,315
Aren't you watch commander tonight?

204
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:10,390
Yeah. So?

205
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:12,198
<i>It's from Hush-Hush magazine.</i>

206
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,032
Buy yourself some loafers.

207
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:16,669
No thanks, Jack.
You keep your payoff.

208
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,475
I'm not interested.

209
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,639
What's this?

210
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:28,989
Six spics.

211
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:32,477
The Mexicans who assaulted
Brown and Helenowski.

212
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,439
I hear Helenowski bled 6 pints,
Brown's in a coma.

213
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,318
They've got bruises
and muscle pulls.

214
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:38,629
It's not what I heard.

215
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,074
Lock them up.

216
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:44,950
Stens, you guys hear what those taco
benders did to Helenowski and Brown?

217
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:50,432
Helenowski lost an eye, and they're
reading Brown his last rites.

218
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:55,277
Should make for a very
merry Christmas for them.

219
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:56,316
Hey, guys.

220
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:57,510
Guys.

221
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,513
They brought the Mexicans in.

222
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:02,114
They're downstairs.

223
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:07,079
- Let's do it.
- Come on. Let's get them.

224
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,478
The party's upstairs.

225
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,713
This doesn't concern you.

226
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:16,789
Come on, guys.

227
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,109
You got work?

228
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,429
Go back.

229
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,757
- Come on, it's Christmas, help me out.
- Move it!

230
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,116
I just got a few more questions.

231
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,839
You don't have to be here.

232
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,190
Go!

233
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,910
You better get your partner
before he kills somebody.

234
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,831
Teach him a lesson!
Get him, Stens!

235
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,956
This is for ours, Poncho.

236
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:46,590
Let me through!

237
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,714
He didn't do nothing!

238
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,678
What are you looking at?

239
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:55,628
- Tell that Mexican to shut up!
- Move!

240
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:56,989
You're sick!

241
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,155
Stens!

242
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,517
- Come on!
- Don't break it up!

243
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,359
Get back! Get back!

244
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,193
Fuck your mother!

245
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,350
Fuck you!

246
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,199
Stop! That's an order!

247
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,313
You're all in my report!

248
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,874
"Bloody Christmas. "

249
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,112
The press love to label.

250
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:51,233
This is bigger than the police board.

251
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:55,473
The grand jury's convening.
Indictments may be handed down.

252
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,034
Will you testify?

253
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,270
No, sir.

254
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,269
District Attorney Loew?

255
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:06,790
You and Officer Stensland
brought the liquor to the station.

256
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:08,838
Stensland was already drunk.

257
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:14,311
Appearing as a witness against him
could offset the damage to yourself.

258
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,549
I won't testify against him
or anyone else.

259
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:20,071
This man is a disgrace.

260
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:23,875
Your badge and gun, officer.
You're suspended from duty.

261
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,309
Dismissed.

262
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:47,679
We need police witnesses to offset
the damage done to the Department.

263
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:50,952
Justice has to be served.
Of course I'll testify.

264
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,832
I'm glad you feel that way.
Most of the men don't.

265
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:59,594
They think silence and integrity
are the same.

266
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,514
Not exactly the image of...

267
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,798
...the new LAPD we're creating.

268
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:07,838
Welcome to Los Angeles,
the city of the future.

269
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:10,594
- May I make a suggestion?
- By all means.

270
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:14,879
The public will expect the Department
to sweep this under the carpet.

271
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:16,749
Don't.

272
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,999
Shift the guilt to men with
secure pensions.

273
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,798
Force them to retire.

274
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:25,031
But somebody has to swing.

275
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:30,115
So indict, try and convict
Richard Stensland and Bud White.

276
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,232
Secure them jail time.

277
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:33,999
The message will be clear.

278
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:39,310
The new LAPD will not tolerate officers
who think they're above the law.

279
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:43,118
Dick Stensland is an embarrassment
as a policeman.

280
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:47,194
He's had rotten fitness reports
from every C.O. He's ever served under.

281
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,351
But White is a valuable officer.

282
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,119
White's a mindless thug.

283
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:57,034
He's just a man who can say "yes" to the
questions I asked you the other day.

284
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:00,438
The Department and the public
need role models.

285
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:03,592
Clean-cut, forthright men
the public can admire.

286
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:05,996
Sergeant...

287
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,158
...I'll promote you...

288
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:09,839
...to Lieutenant.

289
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,992
- Effective immediately.
- Detective Lieutenant.

290
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,678
Ed, you're 30.

291
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:20,310
Your father didn't make lieutenant
until he was 33.

292
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:24,309
I know. I also know when he made
lieutenant, it was as a detective.

293
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,795
Before we start polishing our laurels...

294
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:29,508
...it'd look better if we had
a corroborative witness.

295
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,310
That won't be easy to come by.
The men hate a stool pigeon.

296
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:35,039
Jack Vincennes.

297
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,516
He hit one of the Mexicans.

298
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:41,789
A veteran like Vincennes might
admit his own culpability...

299
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,390
...but not a fellow officer's.

300
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:47,759
<i>Jack's the technical advisor
on Badge of Honor.</i>

301
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,433
He lives for it.

302
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,272
That's how to get to him.

303
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,716
I'd like you to observe, Ed.

304
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,719
Call Sergeant Vincennes.

305
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:03,839
Bright kid.

306
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,957
You may well reap the benefit...

307
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:08,908
...but are you prepared to be despised?

308
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,953
Yes, sir, I am.

309
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:13,836
So be it.

310
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:22,070
Sergeant, we'll get right to it.

311
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:26,513
Nine civilian witnesses identified
you as hitting Ezekiel Garcia.

312
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:31,880
But we have a witness who will name
names and testify that you hit back...

313
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,189
...after being hit.

314
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,676
You'll testify against 3 officers...

315
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:40,436
...who've already earned their pension,
and plead ignorance about the rest.

316
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,711
No thanks. I'm not a snitch.

317
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:46,270
I'll guarantee a slap on the wrist,
a brief suspension...

318
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:49,637
...followed by a temporary transfer
from Narcotics to Vice.

319
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,673
Transfer out of Vice,
you're back on the show.

320
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,395
The show?

321
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,518
<i>Badge of Honor.</i>

322
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,799
We need to tone down
your profile for a bit.

323
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:11,199
I doubt you've ever taken
a stupid breath. Don't start now.

324
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:12,954
Okay, I'll do it.

325
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:18,079
The grand jury hears...

326
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,356
...your testimony tomorrow.
Dismissed.

327
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,111

328
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:35,278
...Detective Lieutenant.

329
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,349
Ace them at the
grand jury tomorrow.

330
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:42,234
Wear a smart-looking suit
and ace them.

331
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,189
And Ed...

332
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:45,998
...lose the glasses.

333
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:58,593
So you're the stellar witness.

334
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:02,230
I should have known.
What's the Chief throwing you?

335
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:03,510
Throwing me?

336
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,552
What's the payoff?

337
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:09,037
You're the payoff expert.
I'm just doing my duty.

338
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:12,670
Come on. You're playing an
angle here, college boy...

339
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:15,912
...so you don't have to hobnob
with the rank and file...

340
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,752
...who'll hate you for snitching.

341
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:20,628
If they make you detective, watch out.

342
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:25,113
Some Bureau guys'll burn in this and
you'll be working with their friends.

343
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:26,190
What about you?

344
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,959
I'm snitching 3 old-timers who'll be
fishing in Oregon next week.

345
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,111
Next to you, I'm clean...

346
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:34,475

00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:40,276
And remember...

349
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:44,035
...Bud White will fuck you for this
if it takes the rest of his life.

350
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,193
Captain, what do you want?

351
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:51,469
Call me Dudley.

352
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,638
Dudley...

353
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:54,990
...what do you want?

354
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:59,630
Look, lad, I admire
your refusal to testify...

355
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,911
...and your loyalty to your partner.

356
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:04,032
I admire you as a policeman...

357
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:08,592
...and your adherence to violence
as a necessary adjunct to the job.

358
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:11,991
And I'm impressed with your
punishment of women-beaters.

359
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,109
Do you hate them?

360
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:17,715
What do you want?

361
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,479
They're yours.

362
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:25,550
Take them.

363
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,519
There's no bill on me?

364
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:33,115
- 4 witnesses recanted their testimony.
- Why?

365
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:34,634
They had a change of heart.

366
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:35,630
And Stensland?

367
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:37,593
Your partner's through.

368
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:39,831
Scapegoat on the Chief's orders.

369
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:41,917
A year from his pension.

370
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,997
- Exley?
- Exley got what he wanted.

371
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:51,471
As a politician he exceeds even myself.

372
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,959
The Department needs
smart men like Exley...

373
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:56,799
...and direct men...

374
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:58,549
...like you.

375
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:03,754
Look lad, I need you for
an assignment the Chief's given me.

376
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:06,310
A duty few men are fit for...

377
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:07,999
...but you were born for.

378
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:11,228
You'd be working
out of Homicide at City Hall.

379
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:12,595
Homicide?

380
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:14,959
Working cases?

381
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:18,594
Your talents lie elsewhere, Wendell.

382
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,633
It's a muscle job.

383
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:25,833
You'll do as I say and ask no questions.
Do you follow my drift?

384
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,598
In Technicolor, sir.

385
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:34,112
<i>"Meet Tony Brancato
and Anthony Trombino...</i>

386
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:37,670
<i>...two rising lieutenants
in the Mickey Cohen rackets.</i>

387
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:40,673
<i>With the dapper little gent in prison...</i>

388
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:44,039
<i>...who knows how far they'll go?
The sky's the limit.</i>

389
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:51,396
<i>Oh, well. "</i>

390
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,278
<i>"Meet Deuce Perkins,
Mickey Cohen's narcotics lieutenant.</i>

391
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:09,839
<i>Could he be behind the hits?</i>

392
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:13,239
<i>Is he consolidating
organized crime power?</i>

393
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,712
<i>I suppose not.</i>

394
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,479
<i>One thing's for sure:</i>

395
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:30,792
<i>2- man triggers are punching the tickets
on the Mickster's muscle. "</i>

396
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:43,475
<i>"Meanwhile, rumor has it the LAPD...</i>

397
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:48,350
<i>...has set up a not-so-Welcome Wagon
to dishearten the criminal element...</i>

398
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:51,717
<i>...from filling the void left by
Mickey's absence.</i>

399
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:54,758
<i>When I know more, dear readers,
so will you.</i>

400
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,560
<i>Off the record, on the q. T...</i>

401
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:59,399
<i>...and very...</i>

402
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,358
<i>...Hush-Hush. "</i>

403
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:06,308
<i>With Mickey Cohen in prison,
Los Angeles is organized-crime-free.</i>

404
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,278
<i>The Chief wants to keep it that way.</i>

405
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:12,438
In Cleveland, you're an
organized crime associate...

406
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:16,309
...in desperate need of re-education
in the ways of polite society.

407
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:20,352
I hear things.

408
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:22,431
Like those 2-men shooter teams.

409
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:24,636
They're 86ing Cohen's lieutenants.

410
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,313
What do you want?

411
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,838
We want you to go home.

412
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:34,872
Picture-book smut, men.

413
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:38,635
There's been a bunch of this
found at crime scenes lately.

414
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:41,713
Quality ranges from piss-poor...

415
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:43,716
...to very well done.

416
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:46,591
Look who's back from suspension.

417
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,271
We're honored, Sergeant Jack.

418
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:52,751
Look at that.
The Great Jerk-Off Case of 1953.

419
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:55,190
Is there someplace you'd rather be?

420
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:58,792
Yeah, working Narcotics,
looking for Cohen's missing H.

421
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:02,959
Yeah, finding 25 pounds of heroin
would get you plenty of ink.

422
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:06,158
You should've thought of that
before Bloody Christmas.

423
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:10,749
Make a major case. It's the only way
you'll get out of here.

424
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,639
Dismissed, gentlemen.

425
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,397
Go get the facts, Jack.

426
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:25,312
Just the facts.

427
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:33,874
<i>Whatever you desire.</i>

428
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,754
Hi. I'd like to get a delivery
to Beverly Hills.

429
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,030
<i>I don't know you.</i>

430
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:42,832
A friend just gave me this number
and I wanted to find out if there was...

431
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:47,629
Would you grab a reverse directory
and shag a name and address for me?

432
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,718
Crestview-2239.

433
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:58,916
<i>Hush-Hush, off the record, on the q. T.</i>

434
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:00,913
Sid, it's Vincennes.

435
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:04,397
Jackie, you back on narco?
I need some good copy.

436
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:06,557
I have something going with Vice.

437
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,273
Something juicy for the Sidster?

438
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:10,670
<i>Tracking porn.
Arty, high-class stuff.</i>

439
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:13,793
<i>Know about Fleur-de-Lis?
Slogan's "Whatever you desire. "</i>

440
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,593
<i>No, I've heard bupkes.</i>

441
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:19,270
Get me some narco skinny.
I want to do an all-hophead issue.

442
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:23,235
<i>Shvartze jazz musicians and movie stars.
You like it?</i>

443
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,839
I'll talk to you later.

444
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,475
- What do you got?
- The number's not assigned.

445
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:28,750
Thanks, Ginger.

446
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:31,789
A bootleg.

447
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:41,635
Take it easy.

448
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,274
Tough break, Stens.

449
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:45,517
We're going to miss you.

450
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:47,359
Raw deal, Stensland.

451
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:52,318
Here comes the snitch.

452
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,599
Sorry about that, Lieutenant.

453
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,632
Stay out of trouble, Bud.

454
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:27,196
I got some time.
I'll buy you a drink.

455
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:29,391
Rain check. I got a hot date.

456
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,430
Who is she and
what did you arrest her for?

457
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:35,188
It's confidential.

458
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:40,111
<i>Like that magazine that
Vincennes scams for. Hush-Hush.</i>

459
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:42,998
I'll see you later in the week.

460
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,398
We'll do the town, on me.

461
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:48,513
Yeah. I'll bring
my wallet just in case.

462
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,791
- See you tomorrow.
- Hang on a minute.

463
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,999
I'll walk down with you.

464
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:07,789
Punk kid. Who is he
trying to impress?

465
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:09,869
Yeah, I wonder.

466
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,310
Got himself a real career going.

467
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:18,670
<i>Sergeant Williams, pick up, please.</i>

468
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:21,439
<i>Sergeant Williams?</i>

469
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:27,234
<i>Is there anybody up there in Homicide?</i>

470
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:29,719
<i>Anybody there?</i>

471
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:32,955
Lieutenant Exley.

472
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,111
<i>You've got a homicide downtown.</i>

473
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:38,119
<i>- The Nite Owl Coffee Shop.
- I got it.</i>

474
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:39,429
It's mine.

475
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:53,194
At least one person's dead.
I stopped for coffee...

476
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:56,120
No one comes through
the front door. Understand?

477
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:32,195
I want barricades both ends
of the street. Make sure...

478
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,471
I took the call. It's my case.

479
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:37,111
You don't want it and you can't have it.

480
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:38,310
I took the call.

481
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:39,635
It's mine.

482
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:42,478
I'll make you my second-in-command.

483
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:44,398
Captain, over here, please.

484
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:52,712
The cook drew a gun and set it off.
The rest died in the men's room.

485
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:01,876
We got a total of 15 spent
12-gauge Remington shotgun shells.

486
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:06,074
I'm betting 3 men, 5-shot capacity
pumps, all of them emptying once.

487
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:09,159
Excuse me, we got an I.D.
On one of the victims.

488
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:10,989
It's Dick Stensland.

489
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:15,955
At first, I thought
she was Rita Hayworth.

490
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:17,594
Yeah, me too.

491
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,911
Hell of a way to avoid prison.

492
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:40,429
What happened?

493
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:43,349
Appears 3 men held up a coffee shop.

494
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:46,359
The guy at the register pulled a.38,
so they killed him.

495
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:48,478
Then they killed everyone else.

496
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:54,193
Lieutenant, we're ready
with that Nite Owl I.D.

497
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,352
Is this your daughter?

498
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,673
I don't know.

499
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:06,949
We know this is difficult.
Take your time.

500
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,756
It seems like my Susan.

501
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,753
But my Susan was a blonde,
not a redhead.

502
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:15,792
When was the last time you saw her?

503
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:18,157
Just before Christmas.

504
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:21,553
We'd fought.
I didn't like her boyfriend.

505
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:23,229
Mrs. Lefferts...

506
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,830
...does your daughter have
any distinguishing marks?

507
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,673
<i>You got the wrong idea, mister.
I'm fine.</i>

508
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:33,518
She has a birthmark on her hip.

509
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:40,593
It's her.

510
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:43,316
My baby.

511
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:48,112
I'm sorry, Mrs. Lefferts.

512
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,555
Who's in charge of this investigation?

513
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:53,433
Captain Smith and myself. Why?

514
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:57,274
<i>"The Nite Owl Massacre. "</i>

515
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:59,198
Hyperbole aside...

516
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:02,916
...this is a heinous crime
that requires swift resolution.

517
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:04,830
Six victims.

518
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,668
One of them, one of our own.
Dick Stensland.

519
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:11,959
He was a Nite Owl regular,
in the wrong place at the wrong time.

520
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,198
Robbery is the likely motive.

521
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:18,752
We have rubber glove smears
on the register and forensics...

522
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:22,590
...tend toward a trio of shooters.
We do have one hot lead.

523
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:24,838
Three Negro juveniles...

524
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:28,510
...were seen discharging shotguns
last night in Griffith Park.

525
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:32,634
A park ranger I.D.'d them as driving
a 1948-1950 Mercury coupe...

526
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,115
...maroon in color.

527
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:38,116
An hour ago a canvassing crew
turned up a news vendor...

528
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:41,876
...who saw a maroon Merc coupe
parked by the Nite Owl at 1 a. m.

529
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:45,956
DMV has come up with
a registration list of Merc coupes.

530
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:51,478
48 two-man teams will shake
three names apiece.

531
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:54,629
Interrogations will be led by
Lt. Edmund Exley.

532
00:34:58,080 --> 00:34:59,308
Enough on that!

533
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:05,876
Gentlemen, just go out and get them.
Use all necessary force.

534
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:09,196
The people of Los Angeles demand it.

535
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:10,949
Dismissed.

536
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:16,111
Why not just put a bounty on them?

537
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:26,152
- Ready to roll?
- You take them. I got something to do.

538
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:28,198
What if one of these names...?

539
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:29,879
Get somebody else.

540
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,791
I got our assignments, Big V.

541
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:35,913
If we go by this list,
we'll never make this collar.

542
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:40,114
I got a guy who knows what happens
south of Jefferson. He'll put us at 50-50.

543
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,879
What are you doing? That's the same
thing that got you in trouble before.

544
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:46,468
I'll take those odds.

545
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:51,794
We got it from here.

546
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:56,315
You should bring along
a photographer.

547
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:04,397
I need an address on a customer
of yours. Her name is Lynn.

548
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:06,398
- That's all I got to go on?
- Yeah.

549
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:09,070
You already know who I mean,
so cough it up.

550
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:12,472
<i>There's a billing address
and a delivery address.</i>

551
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:39,752
Are you Pierce Patchett?

552
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:42,035
I am.

553
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:47,914
Are you soliciting for police charities?
Last time you called my office.

554
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:51,113
Go on down to the driveway.
We'll talk there.

555
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,153
What can I do for you?

556
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:07,630
- Where were you last night?
- I was here hosting a party.

557
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:10,873
Tell me about Dick Stensland.

558
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:13,196
I don't know him, Mr...?

559
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:14,834
Officer White.

560
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:17,075
You know Sue Lefferts?

561
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:19,636
You know I do.
You saw me with her.

562
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:22,839
How did you find me?

563
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:27,434
Nick's Liquor. This is where
Lynn Bracken's booze bills go.

564
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:29,199
Of course.

565
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:34,036
Sue Lefferts died at the Nite Owl.

566
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:36,239
I'm investigating.

567
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:39,799
Everything all right?

568
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:42,032
Fine, Phillip, thank you.

569
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:48,469
What happened to the other guy?
Buzz.

570
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:50,950
Buzz Meeks no longer works for me.

571
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:53,550
Lefferts looked beat-up Christmas Eve
but didn't act it. Why?

572
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:57,833
I think she'd been hit in the face
with a tennis racket. She is... was...

573
00:37:58,200 --> 00:37:59,349
...a big doubles fan.

574
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:02,993
You're a known associate of a woman
killed in a mass murder.

575
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:07,950
- Want to go downtown to discuss it?
- Is this official?

576
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:13,072
Somehow I have the feeling
this is more personal with you.

577
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:17,679
All right, then...

578
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:22,713
...are you concerned about criminal
matters peripheral to the murders?

579
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:26,197
- Not at the moment.
- So you're not obligated to report them.

580
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:30,551
Why were Lefferts' eyes black?

581
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,514
I needed a Rita Hayworth
to fill out my little studio.

582
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:34,790
What little studio?

583
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:38,516
Well, there's Gardner, Russell,
Monroe, Turner...

584
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:40,916
Lynn Bracken is my Veronica Lake.

585
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:43,755
I use girls that look like movie stars.

586
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:46,509
Sometimes I employ a plastic surgeon.

587
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:49,395
When the work was done,
that's when you saw us.

588
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:51,918
It's why her mom couldn't I.D. Her.

589
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:54,833
Jesus fucking Christ.

590
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:56,911
No, Pierce Morehouse Patchett.

591
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:02,556
I sense you're on your best behavior,
but that's all I'm saying.

592
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:04,911
If you persist,
we'll meet with my attorney.

593
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:08,076
Would you like Lynn Bracken's address?

594
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:09,873
I got her address.

595
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:13,071
Find Susan's killer, Mr. White.

596
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:15,631
I'll give you a handsome reward.

597
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:21,636
Whatever you desire!

598
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,479
<i>I know you're not asleep.</i>

599
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:35,592
<i>What do you want?</i>

600
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:37,393
<i>My 5 bucks.</i>

601
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,876
<i>It was the only one I had.</i>

602
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:41,229
Right now?

603
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:44,070
Hey, dollface,
tell him to leave us alone.

604
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:46,510
I understand.
Okay, fine.

605
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:49,069
Oh, baby...

606
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:51,595
...bad news.

607
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:52,870
You have to go.

608
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:54,195
Go?

609
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:57,831
Something very important has come up
and you have to go.

610
00:39:58,200 --> 00:39:59,838
I'll make it up to you.

611
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:02,509
I will, I promise.
Excuse me.

612
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,359
Is it the cops?

613
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:11,909
Miss Bracken...

614
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:13,030
...I'm Officer White.

615
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:15,755
I've been expecting you,
just not this soon.

616
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:18,475
Pierce called.
He told me what happened to Sue.

617
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:21,673
Everything all right, doll?
Want me to get rid of him?

618
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:22,910
Hit the road.

619
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:26,679
Maybe I will...

620
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:28,599
...maybe I won't.

621
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:32,430
LAPD, shitbird. Get out or
I'll have your wife come get you.

622
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:49,793
- Officer.
- Councilman.

623
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:10,997
- Would you care for a drink?
- Yeah, Scotch straight.

624
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:20,076
I was friendly with Sue Lefferts,
but we weren't friends.

625
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:21,709
Know what I mean?

626
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:23,673
You sorry she's dead?

627
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:26,839
Of course I am.

628
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:28,912
What kind of question is that?

629
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:33,156
You know why Pierce
is humoring you?

630
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:35,670
Use words like that,
you might make me mad.

631
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:37,069
But do you know?

632
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:38,475
Yeah, I know.

633
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:41,192
Patchett's running whores...

634
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:44,352
...cut to look like movie stars.

635
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:47,837
And judging by his address,
something bigger on the side.

636
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:49,872
He doesn't want any attention.

637
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:53,556
That's right. Our motives are selfish
so we're cooperating.

638
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:56,559
So cooperate. Why was
Susan Lefferts at the Nite Owl?

639
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:59,395
I don't know. I never heard of
the Nite Owl till today.

640
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:00,590
How'd she meet Patchett?

641
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:02,359
Pierce meets people.

642
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:06,354
Sue had dreams of Hollywood
and this is how they turned out.

643
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:10,475
Thanks to Pierce,
we still get to act a little.

644
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:13,236
Tell me about Pierce.

645
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:15,551
He's waiting for you to mention money.

646
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:19,758
- Want some advice, Miss Bracken?
- It's Lynn.

647
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:21,355
Miss Bracken...

648
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:24,550
...don't ever try to fucking bribe me...

649
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:27,115
...or I'll have you and Patchett
in shit up to your ears.

650
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:30,515
I remember you from Christmas Eve.

651
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:34,718
You have a thing
for helping women, don't you?

652
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:37,192
Maybe I'm just fucking curious.

653
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:40,712
- You say "fuck" a lot.
- You fuck for money.

654
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:44,430
There's blood on your shirt.
Is that an integral part of your job?

655
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:46,193
- Yeah.
- Do you enjoy it?

656
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:47,390
When they deserve it.

657
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:49,034
Did they deserve it today?

658
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:51,630
I'm not sure.

659
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:53,234
- But you did it anyway.
- Yeah.

660
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:56,111
Like the half dozen guys
you screwed today.

661
00:42:57,520 --> 00:42:59,351
Actually, it was only two.

662
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:03,518
You're different, Officer White.

663
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:08,078
You're the first man in years who didn't
tell me I look like Veronica Lake.

664
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:09,998
You look better than Veronica Lake.

665
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:16,310
Pierce Patchett?

666
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,594
He takes a cut of our earnings
and invests it for us.

667
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:23,793
He doesn't let us use narcotics
and he doesn't abuse us.

668
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:27,835
Can your policeman's mentality
grasp those contradictions?

669
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,070
He had you cut
to look like Veronica Lake.

670
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:33,236
No.

671
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:36,633
I'm really a brunette,
but the rest is me.

672
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:40,875
And that's all the news
that's fit to print.

673
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:43,957
It's nice meeting you.

674
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:50,676
- I'd like to see you again.
- For a date...

675
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:52,075
...or an appointment?

676
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:55,109
I don't know.

677
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:58,910
- If it's a date, what's your first name?
- Forget I asked.

678
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:01,393
It was a mistake.

679
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:22,519
Leonard Bidwell?

680
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:25,517
Come down here and talk to us.

681
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:28,749
How's the left these days?

682
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:30,270
What's it to you?

683
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:32,073
I saw you fight Kid Gavilan.

684
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:33,993
I like your style.

685
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:38,192
What do you want, Mr. Policeman?

686
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:41,389
You got a brother in Folsom.
I put him there.

687
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:42,590
Until 1970.

688
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:44,757
How'd you like to make it 1960?

689
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:47,310
I know the judge,
and Lieutenant Exley...

690
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:49,591
...is good friends with the D.A.

691
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:55,317
We're looking for 3 colored guys
who like to pop off shotguns.

692
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:57,557
One owns a maroon Mercury coupe.

693
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,878
- Want me to snitch?
- Want to buy your brother 10 years?

694
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:02,878
- It was 10 years?
- 10 years.

695
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:06,198
You don't have to say anything,
just look at this list...

696
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:07,959
...and point.

697
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:12,117
He's bad, so I'll just tell you.

698
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:13,835
Sugar Ray Collins.

699
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:16,236
Drives a maroon '49 coupe.

700
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:18,353
Beautiful ride.

701
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:22,993
Don't know about shotguns,
but he gets his thrills killing dogs.

702
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:24,555
He's righteous trash.

703
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:27,952
Look at that. It's five minutes
from here. Thanks.

704
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:31,479
I'll hear from you...

705
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:33,828
...about my brother?

706
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:36,236
Keep it up, Lenny. Up.

707
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:44,156
There it is.
It's in the back.

708
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:03,309
- One of ours.
- Shit, somebody beat us here.

709
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:10,349
Damn it.

710
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:12,154
My glasses.

711
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:13,589
You're kidding.

712
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:16,917
Just don't shoot me.

713
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:27,112
What are you doing here?

714
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:29,713
We were in the neighborhood.

715
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:33,396
- What do you got?
- Three 12-gauge pumps.

716
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:34,351
And cash.

717
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:39,108
<i>So long, Vice.
Badge of Honor, here I come.</i>

718
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:41,038
Fuck you! This is our collar.

719
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:42,355
Quiet!

720
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:46,030
I'm ranking officer here.
We go as a team. End of story.

721
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:52,116
Right.

722
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:54,509
How many ways in?

723
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:56,871
Only one. Up the stairs.

724
00:46:58,320 --> 00:47:00,117
He's very serious.

725
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:14,996
Police!

726
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:16,195
Don't shoot!

727
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:20,111
- Don't move.
- Shut up!

728
00:47:20,360 --> 00:47:21,509
Anxious, aren't you?

729
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:22,790
Don't kill them.

730
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:26,439
Back, back, back!

731
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:28,875
Get off me!

732
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:31,479
Against the wall!

733
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:33,432
- Put your hands up!
- Get over there.

734
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:36,232
Shut up!
Hands behind your back!

735
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:38,396
So...

736
00:47:39,080 --> 00:47:41,548
...how's it feel
getting out of the office?

737
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:48,879
This came from forensics.

738
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:50,559
"Burning clothes...

739
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:53,708
...Casitas Youth Camp... "

740
00:47:57,080 --> 00:47:58,718
It's crowded in here, White.

741
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:00,998
These guys killed Stensland.

742
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:19,634
The ejection marks on the shells
fired from the shotguns...

743
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,833
...are identical to those on the
shell casings found at the Nite Owl.

744
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:25,032
I want confessions, Edmund.

745
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:27,391
A night's stewing
has softened them up.

746
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:30,033
I'll break them, sir.

747
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:52,313
Are you sure golden boy
is up to the task, Cap?

748
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:55,793
I think you'd be surprised
what the lad is capable of.

749
00:48:58,160 --> 00:48:59,991
You're 22, aren't you, Ray?

750
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:06,952
Did an officer work you over?

751
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:11,874
- You're 22, right?
- Why do you keep asking that?

752
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:14,470
22 makes it a gas chamber bounce.

753
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:17,076
You should've pulled this 2 years ago.

754
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:20,477
Get life, do a little
Youth Authority jolt...

755
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:22,392
...transfer to Folsom a big man.

756
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:24,518
Get yourself a sissy.

757
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,672
I don't truck with sissies.

758
00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:30,549
Louis.

759
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:32,156
What?

760
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:36,228
You did the Casitas
Youth Camp with Louis.

761
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:40,075
Why you keep asking me about Louis?
His business is his business.

762
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:43,517
Sugar, Louis told me
you went sissy up at Casitas.

763
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:47,708
You couldn't do the time, so you got
a big white boy to look after you.

764
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:49,518
Said they called you Sugar...

765
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:52,196
...because you gave it out so sweet.

766
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:57,119
<i>Louis gave it up at Casitas.
I was the boss jock in my dorm!</i>

767
00:49:57,360 --> 00:49:58,315
He was the sissy!

768
00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:02,548
Louis gave it up for candy bars!
He ain't got the sense of a dog!

769
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:05,033
You like to shoot dogs.

770
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:07,431
Dogs got no reason to live.

771
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:10,754
What about people?

772
00:50:11,120 --> 00:50:12,633
What you trying to say?

773
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:14,394
We got the shotguns.

774
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:16,079
I don't own shotguns.

775
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:18,550
Why were you throwing clothes
in the incinerator?

776
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:19,790
Say what?

777
00:50:20,360 --> 00:50:24,478
A neighbor said she saw you
throwing clothes in the incinerator.

778
00:50:24,840 --> 00:50:25,829
Doesn't look good.

779
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:28,111
I ain't talking till I see a judge.

780
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:31,677
Were you on hop? You were
passed out when we arrested you.

781
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:34,349
Ty and Louis fuck
with that shit, not me.

782
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:36,233
Where do they get their stuff?

783
00:50:37,640 --> 00:50:38,595
Come on.

784
00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:42,118
Give me one to feed the D.A.
It'll make me look good...

785
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:45,870
...and I'll say Sugar Ray's not a punk
like his sissy partners.

786
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:54,510
Tell me where Jones and Fontaine...

787
00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:56,114
...get their drugs.

788
00:50:59,080 --> 00:51:00,399
Roland Navarette.

789
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:04,438
He runs a hole-up on Bunker Hill.

790
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:06,631
And he sells red devils.

791
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:08,953
Exley's good, I'll give him that.

792
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:10,196
I'll take a break.

793
00:51:14,120 --> 00:51:16,873
You know, I'm talking
about the gas chamber...

794
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:20,155
...and you haven't asked me
what this is about.

795
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:23,394
You got a big "guilty" sign
around your neck.

796
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:29,632
That was masterful.

797
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:31,075
He's ready to go.

798
00:51:38,680 --> 00:51:41,069
Give Jones the newspaper.
I want him primed.

799
00:51:41,320 --> 00:51:43,595
Take the cuffs off so he can read it.

800
00:51:44,080 --> 00:51:47,516
Ray Collins just ratted you off.
Said the Nite Owl was your idea.

801
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:51,913
I think it was Ray's idea.
You talk, I think I can save your life.

802
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:55,440
6 people are dead,
and someone has to pay for it.

803
00:51:55,800 --> 00:51:58,519
Now, it can be you, or it can be Ray.

804
00:52:00,680 --> 00:52:02,352
Louis, he called you queer.

805
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:06,355
- He said you took it up the ass.
- I didn't kill nobody!

806
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:09,675
Son...

807
00:52:11,560 --> 00:52:13,915
...you know what'll happen
if you don't talk.

808
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:16,953
You'll go to the gas chamber.
So admit what you did.

809
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:19,673
I didn't mean to hurt her.

810
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:22,679
- Maybe she's okay.
- Okay?

811
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:27,031
They're in the morgue.
They were dead when you left them.

812
00:52:27,360 --> 00:52:31,638
I just wanted to lose my cherry.
She don't die, so I don't die.

813
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:34,349
She don't die, so I don't die.

814
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:37,109
Louis, who's the girl?
What's her name?

815
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:39,193
Who are you talking about?

816
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:41,472
Was she at the Nite Owl?

817
00:52:42,120 --> 00:52:44,350
Listen to me, was she at the Nite Owl?

818
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:53,675
- This newspaper ain't shit!
- Where's the girl?

819
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:54,750
You kill her?

820
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:59,912
Louis lost his cherry, but things
got out of hand. You made her bleed.

821
00:53:00,280 --> 00:53:02,350
She bled on your clothes,
so you burned the clothes.

822
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:03,436
Who said that?!

823
00:53:04,840 --> 00:53:06,114
Now, listen to me.

824
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:08,835
If she's alive, she's your
only chance.

825
00:53:09,080 --> 00:53:10,229
I think she's alive.

826
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:11,994
Where is she now?

827
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:14,038
You leave her someplace?

828
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:16,993
Tell me where she is!

829
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:20,598
What're you doing?!

830
00:53:20,840 --> 00:53:21,989
Don't.

831
00:53:23,080 --> 00:53:23,956
White!

832
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:27,116
1 in 6! Where's the girl?

833
00:53:27,320 --> 00:53:28,799
I have this under control!

834
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:30,359
Where's the girl?

835
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:41,552
Sylvester Fitch, 109 Avalon...

836
00:53:42,360 --> 00:53:44,749
...brown corner house, upstairs.

837
00:53:56,760 --> 00:53:58,876
- Just give me one minute.
- You got it.

838
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:06,159
<i>Nobody moves.</i>

839
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:08,597
We're going in the front.
Stay put...

840
00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:10,239
<i>...until I give the word.</i>

841
00:56:29,840 --> 00:56:31,478
He went around back!

842
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:36,913
I'm Lieutenant Exley. I'm sorry,
I need to know what time they left.

843
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:39,390
Get her to the hospital.
Excuse me.

844
00:56:39,960 --> 00:56:41,279
Give your career a rest.

845
00:56:41,800 --> 00:56:42,869
Leave her alone.

846
00:56:43,240 --> 00:56:45,754
A naked guy with a gun?
Who'll believe that?

847
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,638
Get the fuck away from me.

848
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:52,432
- How will that look in your report?
- Like justice. That's what the man got.

849
00:56:52,840 --> 00:56:55,752
- Justice.
- You don't know the meaning of the word.

850
00:56:56,560 --> 00:56:59,632
You think it means getting
your picture in the paper.

851
00:56:59,880 --> 00:57:01,996
Go after criminals for a change.

852
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:04,276
Stensland got what he deserved
and so will you.

853
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:20,551
It's best to stay away
when his blood is up.

854
00:57:20,840 --> 00:57:22,239
His blood's always up.

855
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:25,671
Perhaps you should
avoid him altogether.

856
00:57:26,560 --> 00:57:29,597
<i>Raymond Collins, Ty Jones
and Louis Fontaine.</i>

857
00:57:29,960 --> 00:57:32,428
<i>They are considered
armed and dangerous.</i>

858
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:35,268
<i>Repeat. The Nite Owl
suspects have escaped.</i>

859
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:37,512
How'd they get out the window?

860
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:39,512
They jumped from the 2nd floor.

861
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:43,719
Girl said they left her at 12.
They could get to the Nite Owl by 1.

862
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:47,951
The question was,
where did they get their drugs?

863
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:50,077
I haven't gotten that far yet.

864
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:53,870
"Roland Navarette lives on Bunker Hill.
He runs a hole-up... "

865
00:57:56,120 --> 00:57:57,394
Anyone seen Jack Vincennes?

866
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:00,793
Is something up?

867
00:58:01,160 --> 00:58:02,832
I need backup. Come on.

868
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:21,511
- What?
- Nothing. Let's go.

869
00:58:29,800 --> 00:58:31,028
This should be it.

870
00:58:35,560 --> 00:58:36,356
404.

871
00:58:57,360 --> 00:58:58,156
Nobody moves!

872
00:58:59,480 --> 00:59:00,276
Stay right there!

873
00:59:00,520 --> 00:59:02,317
- You're under arrest.
- Don't shoot!

874
00:59:02,560 --> 00:59:04,039
Please don't shoot!

875
00:59:04,280 --> 00:59:05,349
Don't move!

876
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:55,916
<i>There he is.</i>

877
00:59:57,080 --> 00:59:58,274
You did good, kid.

878
00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:01,632
You should've seen this place.
Blood everywhere.

879
01:00:02,280 --> 01:00:04,555
Who would have thought?
Shotgun Ed.

880
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:06,953
Somebody get him cleaned up.

881
01:00:07,320 --> 01:00:08,150
Come on.

882
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:15,069
<i>Edmund J. Exley
has amassed a brilliant record...</i>

883
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:17,635
...in his 7 years with the
Los Angeles Police Department.

884
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,798
Recently, he evinced
spectacular bravery in the line of duty.

885
01:00:21,160 --> 01:00:23,754
It is our privilege to present him
with our highest honor:

886
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:25,679
The Medal of Valor.

887
01:00:26,040 --> 01:00:28,110
- What kind of car was it?
- It was a Ford.

888
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:30,948
My husband always drove a Ford.
I know what they look like.

889
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:34,194
Excuse me, ma'am.
Just the facts. Light or dark?

890
01:00:34,560 --> 01:00:38,075
Light. And that's really
all I remember, Officer.

891
01:00:39,080 --> 01:00:40,877
Thank you.
You've been a big help.

892
01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:42,953
Cut!
That's a print.

893
01:00:43,320 --> 01:00:44,594
Big Jack!

894
01:00:45,240 --> 01:00:46,116
He's back!

895
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:48,232
Jack's back.

896
01:01:20,120 --> 01:01:23,476
Tell Mr. Patchett I have no intention
of changing my vote.

897
01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:39,191
It may surprise some that an official
would admit to making a mistake...

898
01:01:40,120 --> 01:01:42,350
...but after due consideration...

899
01:01:43,040 --> 01:01:45,998
...I am changing my position
on the matter before the council.

900
01:01:47,880 --> 01:01:50,872
"Go west, America"
was a slogan of Manifest Destiny.

901
01:01:51,240 --> 01:01:54,630
Today is that last step westward
with no stop signs...

902
01:01:55,040 --> 01:01:57,076
...no traffic signals, from downtown...

903
01:01:57,440 --> 01:01:59,317
...to the beach in 20 minutes.

904
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,036
What were you going to start with?

905
01:02:33,080 --> 01:02:34,433
Prostitution?

906
01:02:36,200 --> 01:02:37,349
Gambling?

907
01:02:40,680 --> 01:02:44,559
Go back to Jersey, sonny.
This is the City of the Angels...

908
01:02:44,840 --> 01:02:46,831
...and you haven't got any wings.

909
01:03:08,840 --> 01:03:10,956
Nice to see you again.
Take care.

910
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:49,917
I wondered when you'd
knock on my door again, Officer White.

911
01:03:50,640 --> 01:03:51,595
It's Bud.

912
01:03:53,240 --> 01:03:54,229
Bud.

913
01:04:22,560 --> 01:04:23,515
Why me?

914
01:04:25,600 --> 01:04:26,669
I don't know.

915
01:05:01,880 --> 01:05:02,915
This election...

916
01:05:03,280 --> 01:05:06,272
...is about the future of
law enforcement in Los Angeles.

917
01:05:06,640 --> 01:05:09,473
City Councilman Rogers
represents that future.

918
01:05:09,880 --> 01:05:11,393
So let's dig deep...

919
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:15,196
...and get a moral man re-elected.
Ellis Loew wants to say a few words.

920
01:05:19,240 --> 01:05:22,073
<i>Thank you, Brett Chase.
The talented star of Badge of Honor.</i>

921
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:26,914
Let me tell you,
I am so thrilled to be here.

922
01:05:28,640 --> 01:05:29,595
Big V.

923
01:05:31,960 --> 01:05:33,439
Good to see you back.

924
01:05:33,800 --> 01:05:36,314
- How they hanging, Sid?
- Down around my ankles.

925
01:05:36,680 --> 01:05:38,352
You tight with the D.A., Jackie?

926
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:41,910
He tried to throw me
off the force last Christmas.

927
01:05:42,280 --> 01:05:43,679
How about some payback, big-time?

928
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:48,431
Plus the usual $50 donation
to the Jack Vincennes retirement fund.

929
01:05:49,040 --> 01:05:51,918
- Did you know the D.A. Was a swish?
- No kidding?

930
01:05:54,560 --> 01:05:57,393
Remember Matt Reynolds? Christmas Eve?
"The Movie Premiere Pot Bust"?

931
01:05:57,760 --> 01:06:00,149
- He just got off the honor farm.
- What's he doing here?

932
01:06:01,080 --> 01:06:03,355
Reynolds is acey-deucey,
not to mention broke.

933
01:06:03,720 --> 01:06:05,836
I'm getting him
to fuck the D.A. For $ 100.

934
01:06:06,200 --> 01:06:08,873
That's twice the $50
you got for wrecking his career.

935
01:06:10,600 --> 01:06:12,955
- Come here, come here.
- Jesus, don't bring him...

936
01:06:17,800 --> 01:06:19,313
That's D.A. Loew right there.

937
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:25,629
You need a drink?

938
01:06:26,560 --> 01:06:27,470
Yeah.

939
01:06:28,600 --> 01:06:29,589
Look after him.

940
01:06:29,960 --> 01:06:33,509
Matt, this is Jack.
No secrets between me and him.

941
01:06:38,720 --> 01:06:40,870
- How you doing?
- I'm okay. How're you?

942
01:06:41,160 --> 01:06:42,229
I'm good.

943
01:06:45,240 --> 01:06:46,912
Have we met before?

944
01:06:49,240 --> 01:06:50,229
Yeah.

945
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:52,589
Was it at a party?

946
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:54,638
It was something like that.

947
01:06:56,280 --> 01:06:57,759
Fleur-de-Lis party, right?

948
01:06:59,080 --> 01:07:00,069
Right.

949
01:07:00,840 --> 01:07:02,159
Fleur-de-Lis.

950
01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:04,632
"Whatever you desire. "

951
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,434
Dope, hookers that
look like movie stars...

952
01:07:07,960 --> 01:07:09,678
...Pierce Patchett has it all.

953
01:07:10,720 --> 01:07:12,358
You could say that again.

954
01:07:12,720 --> 01:07:15,029
Pierce, he's not like regular guys.

955
01:07:16,760 --> 01:07:17,909
I dig him...

956
01:07:19,520 --> 01:07:20,350
...but you know...

957
01:07:21,520 --> 01:07:22,794
...he scares me too.

958
01:07:23,640 --> 01:07:24,629
Really?

959
01:07:25,240 --> 01:07:26,070
How?

960
01:07:27,160 --> 01:07:31,756
When I came out to L.A. This isn't
exactly where I saw myself ending up.

961
01:07:33,160 --> 01:07:34,195
Yeah, well...

962
01:07:34,560 --> 01:07:35,595
...get in line.

963
01:07:36,200 --> 01:07:38,077
Dutch courage, kid. Drink up.

964
01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:44,871
I don't think I should do this.

965
01:07:45,440 --> 01:07:47,431
It's not like you don't know how.

966
01:07:47,680 --> 01:07:51,992
<i>Jack's connected to Badge of Honor.
Pull this off, you'll get a part.</i>

967
01:07:52,360 --> 01:07:54,999
I smell a comeback, don't you, Jack?

968
01:07:57,640 --> 01:07:58,709
The D.A.'s free.

969
01:07:59,080 --> 01:08:01,469
Go introduce yourself. Go on.

970
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:04,354
Tell him about the opening on the show.

971
01:08:05,600 --> 01:08:07,670
I'm pretty sure I can get you a part.

972
01:08:09,440 --> 01:08:14,355
But that's later on. Tonight, just
go over and pretend it's an acting job.

973
01:08:14,720 --> 01:08:15,914
Like show biz.

974
01:08:16,280 --> 01:08:17,315
Acting, that's it.

975
01:08:17,680 --> 01:08:18,396
Right.

976
01:08:18,760 --> 01:08:20,273
No one's going to know about this?

977
01:08:20,640 --> 01:08:21,231
No.

978
01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:24,953
It'll be our secret.

979
01:08:29,560 --> 01:08:31,869
- Show biz.
- That's it. Go on.

980
01:08:35,320 --> 01:08:36,878
Show biz.

981
01:08:38,880 --> 01:08:41,030
If Reynolds works his charms,
and he will...

982
01:08:41,280 --> 01:08:43,953
...they'll be at the Hollywood
Center Motel, room 203.

983
01:08:44,200 --> 01:08:46,191
Meet me there at midnight
for a photo shoot.

984
01:08:47,320 --> 01:08:50,232
Maybe we can work in
the Hollywood sign this time.

985
01:08:51,560 --> 01:08:53,118
You know Pierce Patchett?

986
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:56,359
I know what you know.

987
01:08:56,720 --> 01:09:00,793
He's rich. Invested in the freeways,
which'll make him richer. Why?

988
01:09:02,120 --> 01:09:03,997
I keep hearing rumors.

989
01:09:04,360 --> 01:09:07,477
High-class porn, drugs, hookers
that look like movie stars.

990
01:09:08,560 --> 01:09:11,632
Patchett's what I call twilight.
He ain't queer or red.

991
01:09:12,120 --> 01:09:15,669
<i>He cannot help me in my quest
for prime sinnuendo.</i>

992
01:09:21,200 --> 01:09:24,988
<i>As though Badge of Honor would
touch that guy with a 10-foot pole...</i>

993
01:09:25,360 --> 01:09:28,238
<i>...after he's been Hush-Hush
cover boy twice in one year.</i>

994
01:09:28,600 --> 01:09:29,589
See you soon.

995
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:33,709
Midnight. I guarantee all kinds
of illegal activity.

996
01:10:05,680 --> 01:10:06,715
Another, Jack?

997
01:10:50,320 --> 01:10:51,275
Kid?

998
01:10:58,960 --> 01:11:01,315
Come on, you don't have to do this...

999
01:11:31,840 --> 01:11:34,035
Thank you for what you did for me...

1000
01:11:34,360 --> 01:11:36,794
...for killing those animals
who raped me.

1001
01:11:37,200 --> 01:11:39,839
Will you thank Officer White
for me, please?

1002
01:11:40,080 --> 01:11:41,035
Sure.

1003
01:11:42,560 --> 01:11:46,314
Seeing him come through the door
is about the only thing I remember.

1004
01:11:46,560 --> 01:11:47,549
Thank God.

1005
01:11:48,600 --> 01:11:51,398
You remember what time
the Negroes left you?

1006
01:11:51,640 --> 01:11:54,632
In your statement, you said
they left you at midnight.

1007
01:11:54,880 --> 01:11:55,915
They might have.

1008
01:12:01,240 --> 01:12:02,514
They "might" have?

1009
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:06,190
I don't know what time they left me.
I wanted them dead.

1010
01:12:06,680 --> 01:12:09,831
Would anyone care that they
raped a Mexican girl...

1011
01:12:10,160 --> 01:12:12,958
...if they hadn't killed those
white people at the Nite Owl?

1012
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,150
I did what I had to do for justice.

1013
01:12:17,040 --> 01:12:18,268
Exley, over here.

1014
01:12:18,520 --> 01:12:19,509
Smile, Inez.

1015
01:12:21,160 --> 01:12:22,832
Is he your hero?

1016
01:12:23,520 --> 01:12:27,638
Fellas, how about this? " Rape Victim
Wheeled Out by Nite Owl Hero. "

1017
01:12:33,200 --> 01:12:35,191
All they get is Veronica Lake.

1018
01:12:37,440 --> 01:12:39,556
I get Lynn Margaret Bracken.

1019
01:12:50,320 --> 01:12:51,309
"Bisbee"?

1020
01:12:53,560 --> 01:12:54,913
I grew up there.

1021
01:12:57,040 --> 01:13:01,238
I'm going back in a couple of years,
open up a dress shop.

1022
01:13:03,280 --> 01:13:06,238
The girls in Bisbee
need a little glamour.

1023
01:13:11,680 --> 01:13:13,113
Where'd this come from?

1024
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:18,589
I was 12. My dad went after my mother
with a bottle. I got in the way.

1025
01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:22,039
So you saved her.

1026
01:13:23,520 --> 01:13:24,635
Not for long.

1027
01:13:27,760 --> 01:13:30,752
- I'm sorry. It's none of my business.
- He tied me to the radiator.

1028
01:13:31,640 --> 01:13:34,598
I watched him beat my mother to death
with a tire iron...

1029
01:13:37,040 --> 01:13:38,393
...and he left me there.

1030
01:13:40,920 --> 01:13:43,673
Three days before
a truant officer found us.

1031
01:13:46,840 --> 01:13:48,512
They never found the old man.

1032
01:13:57,600 --> 01:13:59,397
Is that why you became a cop?

1033
01:14:00,240 --> 01:14:01,468
To get even?

1034
01:14:03,120 --> 01:14:04,109
Maybe.

1035
01:14:06,040 --> 01:14:07,359
Do you like it?

1036
01:14:10,640 --> 01:14:11,834
I used to.

1037
01:14:13,880 --> 01:14:16,519
Now it's all strong-arm,
sitting duck stuff.

1038
01:14:20,080 --> 01:14:23,755
If I could get a chance to work
Homicide like a real detective...

1039
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,594
That prick, Exley.
He shot the wrong guys.

1040
01:14:29,240 --> 01:14:33,597
Whoever killed Stensland's still around.
I know it in here. I know it.

1041
01:14:34,320 --> 01:14:36,038
Something's wrong
with the Nite Owl.

1042
01:14:36,440 --> 01:14:38,396
I just can't prove it, that's all.

1043
01:14:39,680 --> 01:14:41,432
I'm not smart enough.

1044
01:14:43,480 --> 01:14:46,517
I'm just the guy they bring in
to scare the other guy shitless.

1045
01:14:49,720 --> 01:14:50,994
You're wrong.

1046
01:14:51,920 --> 01:14:54,229
You found Patchett. You found me.

1047
01:14:54,720 --> 01:14:56,358
You're smart enough.

1048
01:15:07,640 --> 01:15:10,552
Bud White. What brings you
down to the basement?

1049
01:15:14,200 --> 01:15:16,031
A couple of Nite Owl questions.

1050
01:15:16,280 --> 01:15:19,238
Don't know if you read the papers,
but that case is closed.

1051
01:15:21,200 --> 01:15:22,918
Anything bother you about it?

1052
01:15:23,640 --> 01:15:27,155
The fact that the pack-up boys haven't
hauled this shit out of here yet.

1053
01:15:31,680 --> 01:15:35,514
The suspects' 3 shotguns match
the strike marks on the shell casings.

1054
01:15:36,600 --> 01:15:38,192
What more do you want?

1055
01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:51,352
There's blood on the wall here.

1056
01:15:51,960 --> 01:15:54,315
I thought everyone got shot
in the men's room.

1057
01:15:54,560 --> 01:15:56,755
That is Stensland's blood.

1058
01:15:58,840 --> 01:16:02,549
Blow to the head. Probably unconscious
when they dragged him in the john.

1059
01:16:04,120 --> 01:16:05,394
They hit anyone else?

1060
01:16:05,640 --> 01:16:08,712
No, but he was a cop.
Probably tried to do something.

1061
01:16:12,480 --> 01:16:15,870
Grilled cheese, black coffee.
Someone was sitting next to him.

1062
01:16:19,840 --> 01:16:21,478
2 of the victims were women?

1063
01:16:21,760 --> 01:16:25,469
Yeah, Patti DeLuca, the night shift
waitress, and a Susan Lefferts.

1064
01:16:30,040 --> 01:16:31,678
Susan Lefferts.

1065
01:16:33,360 --> 01:16:34,679
What about her?

1066
01:16:37,760 --> 01:16:38,988
You're welcome!

1067
01:16:44,880 --> 01:16:45,995
Mrs. Lefferts?

1068
01:16:46,360 --> 01:16:48,112
I'm Officer White, LAPD.

1069
01:16:50,960 --> 01:16:54,111
Tell me about the boyfriend.
The one you mentioned at the coroner's.

1070
01:16:54,360 --> 01:16:56,590
Susie, I told you
I didn't approve.

1071
01:16:57,200 --> 01:17:01,318
He was too old for you.
And you let him be fresh with me.

1072
01:17:03,120 --> 01:17:05,315
They came here one day
when I wasn't home.

1073
01:17:05,880 --> 01:17:07,472
Mrs. Jensen next door said...

1074
01:17:07,840 --> 01:17:11,116
...she saw Susie's boyfriend
and another man...

1075
01:17:11,480 --> 01:17:13,072
...and she heard a ruckus.

1076
01:17:13,840 --> 01:17:14,875
What was his name?

1077
01:17:15,160 --> 01:17:17,594
We weren't properly introduced.

1078
01:17:18,320 --> 01:17:20,390
He had a nickname, Muns or Luns.

1079
01:17:20,760 --> 01:17:23,115
Stens? Was it Stens?

1080
01:17:23,360 --> 01:17:24,395
Maybe.

1081
01:17:24,760 --> 01:17:26,671
- I don't know.
- Look at this picture.

1082
01:17:30,360 --> 01:17:31,395
That's him.

1083
01:17:31,800 --> 01:17:32,755
That's him.

1084
01:17:37,920 --> 01:17:40,150
You said a neighbor heard a ruckus.

1085
01:17:40,720 --> 01:17:41,596
Outside?

1086
01:17:41,840 --> 01:17:42,750
Inside?

1087
01:17:43,960 --> 01:17:45,075
Outside.

1088
01:17:45,440 --> 01:17:49,115
And then Mrs. Jensen said
they kept going under the house.

1089
01:17:53,160 --> 01:17:55,355
You have to leave now, Officer.

1090
01:17:56,640 --> 01:17:59,871
- What's through here?
- Just a room full of old things.

1091
01:18:00,120 --> 01:18:01,872
Don't move that.

1092
01:18:04,280 --> 01:18:07,716
Don't mind the smell.
I think a rat died behind the wall.

1093
01:18:09,040 --> 01:18:10,393
My Susie was a good girl.

1094
01:18:11,120 --> 01:18:14,032
She was never in any
kind of trouble at all.

1095
01:19:22,520 --> 01:19:24,670
<i>"Leland Meeks. "
Never heard of you.</i>

1096
01:19:25,040 --> 01:19:26,439
<i>They call me Buzz.</i>

1097
01:19:33,240 --> 01:19:34,389
Was it a rat?

1098
01:19:35,280 --> 01:19:36,952
Yeah, a great big one.

1099
01:19:39,280 --> 01:19:40,235
Here.

1100
01:19:41,200 --> 01:19:43,031
Compliments of the Police Department.

1101
01:19:59,480 --> 01:20:02,153
Stomach of the week
from a motel homicide.

1102
01:20:02,400 --> 01:20:05,836
Unemployed actor had frankfurter,
french fries, alcohol and sperm.

1103
01:20:06,080 --> 01:20:08,355
Hell of a last supper,
don't you think?

1104
01:20:08,600 --> 01:20:11,398
Anything bothering you
about the Nite Owl case?

1105
01:20:11,920 --> 01:20:13,797
The fact that you guys
won't let it go.

1106
01:20:14,960 --> 01:20:18,396
- What do you mean?
- Bud White grilled me on it today.

1107
01:20:19,520 --> 01:20:20,589
Bud White?

1108
01:20:21,320 --> 01:20:23,151
He's not as dumb as I thought.

1109
01:20:25,440 --> 01:20:27,954
Did he say where he was going?

1110
01:20:39,960 --> 01:20:41,678
Let my daughter rest in peace!

1111
01:20:41,920 --> 01:20:43,956
I just want to ask a few questions.

1112
01:20:44,200 --> 01:20:46,475
Officer White already checked
under the house.

1113
01:20:47,040 --> 01:20:48,075
Under the house?

1114
01:20:48,800 --> 01:20:50,916
- Where?
- Out back.

1115
01:20:52,440 --> 01:20:53,953
All he found was rodents.

1116
01:20:57,200 --> 01:21:00,954
I need an I.D. On this as soon as
possible. Talk only to me on this one.

1117
01:21:04,800 --> 01:21:05,710
I need your help.

1118
01:21:05,960 --> 01:21:09,191
I'm busy. Why don't you ask
your boys in Homicide?

1119
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,594
I can't. I need someone
outside of Homicide.

1120
01:21:15,280 --> 01:21:17,919
I want you to tail Bud White.

1121
01:21:19,360 --> 01:21:21,430
Do me a favor. Leave me alone.

1122
01:21:22,600 --> 01:21:24,795
You make the 3 Negroes
for the Nite Owl killings?

1123
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:28,796
What?

1124
01:21:29,120 --> 01:21:30,394
It's a simple question.

1125
01:21:32,520 --> 01:21:35,114
Why in the world
do you want to dig deeper...

1126
01:21:35,480 --> 01:21:37,198
...into the Nite Owl killings...

1127
01:21:37,560 --> 01:21:38,595
...Lieutenant?

1128
01:21:42,320 --> 01:21:43,639
Rollo Tomasi.

1129
01:21:45,760 --> 01:21:47,671
Is there more or do I have to guess?

1130
01:21:50,720 --> 01:21:52,676
Rollo was a purse snatcher.

1131
01:21:57,040 --> 01:21:58,917
My father ran into him off-duty.

1132
01:22:00,960 --> 01:22:03,793
He shot my father 6 times
and got away clean.

1133
01:22:05,360 --> 01:22:06,918
No one knew who he was.

1134
01:22:07,880 --> 01:22:09,836
I made the name up
to give him personality.

1135
01:22:11,640 --> 01:22:12,629
Your point?

1136
01:22:13,280 --> 01:22:15,794
Rollo Tomasi's the reason
I became a cop.

1137
01:22:16,680 --> 01:22:19,911
I wanted to catch the guys who
thought they could get away with it.

1138
01:22:21,440 --> 01:22:23,112
It was about justice.

1139
01:22:24,080 --> 01:22:26,833
Then somewhere along the way
I lost sight of that.

1140
01:22:30,920 --> 01:22:32,114
Why'd you become a cop?

1141
01:22:42,320 --> 01:22:43,878
I don't remember.

1142
01:22:50,440 --> 01:22:51,589
What do you want?

1143
01:22:52,320 --> 01:22:53,799
I want to solve this.

1144
01:22:54,520 --> 01:22:56,033
Nite Owl was solved.

1145
01:22:58,880 --> 01:22:59,995
I want to do it right.

1146
01:23:00,800 --> 01:23:02,950
Even if it means
paying the consequences?

1147
01:23:06,440 --> 01:23:08,078
All right, college boy, I'll help.

1148
01:23:08,600 --> 01:23:11,114
But there's a case your boys
in Homicide don't care about.

1149
01:23:11,480 --> 01:23:15,109
They think it's just another
Hollywood "homo" -cide. But I don't.

1150
01:23:16,080 --> 01:23:19,072
You help me with mine,
I'll help you with yours.

1151
01:23:19,640 --> 01:23:20,470
Deal?

1152
01:23:21,560 --> 01:23:22,310
Deal.

1153
01:23:53,520 --> 01:23:55,397
Johnny Stompanato.

1154
01:23:56,640 --> 01:23:59,234
<i>Officer Wendell White.
How's tricks, paesano?</i>

1155
01:23:59,600 --> 01:24:01,033
<i>I ain't your paesano.</i>

1156
01:24:01,920 --> 01:24:03,876
I ain't in the snitch business anymore.

1157
01:24:04,200 --> 01:24:06,156
You know a guy named Buzz Meeks?

1158
01:24:07,320 --> 01:24:08,958
Works for Pierce Patchett.

1159
01:24:09,640 --> 01:24:10,675
Should I?

1160
01:24:12,120 --> 01:24:14,714
You're muscle for hire.
Meeks is muscle for hire.

1161
01:24:15,080 --> 01:24:16,229
You tell me.

1162
01:24:18,200 --> 01:24:19,918
Yeah, I remember now.

1163
01:24:20,280 --> 01:24:23,590
Meeks is a run-down ex-cop.
Same as you'll be some day.

1164
01:24:23,960 --> 01:24:25,359
That's all you'll get.

1165
01:24:26,200 --> 01:24:27,838
Keep your $20.

1166
01:24:33,240 --> 01:24:36,516
What do I get if I give you your
balls back, you wop cocksucker?

1167
01:24:40,720 --> 01:24:42,790
There was a rumor going around...

1168
01:24:43,160 --> 01:24:46,038
...that Meeks had a line
on a large supply of H.

1169
01:24:48,120 --> 01:24:48,916
And?

1170
01:24:49,720 --> 01:24:50,914
And nothing!

1171
01:24:51,280 --> 01:24:52,759
He skipped out.

1172
01:25:04,760 --> 01:25:05,795
Bullshit.

1173
01:25:06,800 --> 01:25:09,792
How would Meeks get his hands
on a large supply of heroin?

1174
01:25:10,680 --> 01:25:11,715
You're right.

1175
01:25:11,960 --> 01:25:13,678
It's probably bullshit.

1176
01:25:14,040 --> 01:25:16,349
Even if he did,
he couldn't unload it.

1177
01:25:16,760 --> 01:25:19,115
Not without drawing
all kinds of attention.

1178
01:25:19,680 --> 01:25:23,389
Maybe that's why he's under a house
in Elysian Park not smelling too good...

1179
01:25:24,920 --> 01:25:26,069
<i>...paesano.</i>

1180
01:26:16,520 --> 01:26:18,795
Maybe White's
not so dumb after all.

1181
01:26:31,640 --> 01:26:35,349
<i>We got Rita Hayworth at the morgue,
and now Veronica Lake with White.</i>

1182
01:26:35,960 --> 01:26:39,999
I think your case and my case
are connected. It's Fleur-de-Lis again.

1183
01:26:40,280 --> 01:26:41,315
Fleur-de-Lis?

1184
01:26:42,360 --> 01:26:43,759
"Whatever you desire. "

1185
01:26:44,120 --> 01:26:45,075
Porno.

1186
01:26:45,560 --> 01:26:48,120
High-class whores
cut to look like movie stars.

1187
01:26:48,480 --> 01:26:51,756
Who knows what else? Reynolds,
the kid that got killed, was involved.

1188
01:26:52,120 --> 01:26:53,519
So is Pierce Patchett.

1189
01:26:53,880 --> 01:26:54,995
The millionaire?

1190
01:26:55,640 --> 01:26:57,437
I think we should talk to him.

1191
01:26:58,320 --> 01:27:00,117
First I want to brace Stompanato.

1192
01:27:15,840 --> 01:27:18,070
Want an autograph?
Write to MGM.

1193
01:27:19,040 --> 01:27:22,032
Since when do two-bit hoods
and hookers give out autographs?

1194
01:27:22,560 --> 01:27:23,515
What?

1195
01:27:23,760 --> 01:27:24,954
LAPD. Sit down.

1196
01:27:25,200 --> 01:27:27,236
Who the hell do you think you are?

1197
01:27:27,480 --> 01:27:28,799
Take a walk, honey.

1198
01:27:29,240 --> 01:27:32,198
- You're making a large mistake.
- Get away from our table.

1199
01:27:32,560 --> 01:27:33,436
Shut up.

1200
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:37,070
A hooker cut to look like Lana Turner
is still a hooker.

1201
01:27:38,200 --> 01:27:40,509
- She just looks like Lana Turner.
- She is Lana Turner.

1202
01:27:42,040 --> 01:27:43,712
She is Lana Turner.

1203
01:27:52,640 --> 01:27:54,232
How was I supposed to know?

1204
01:28:09,880 --> 01:28:13,395
I believe the Nite Owl's
your area of expertise, Mr. Exley.

1205
01:28:13,800 --> 01:28:16,155
I saw you on television
getting your medal.

1206
01:28:17,760 --> 01:28:18,829
And you're...

1207
01:28:19,320 --> 01:28:22,915
...that other Hollywood
celebrity policeman, aren't you?

1208
01:28:23,960 --> 01:28:27,635
The Veronica Lake look-alike works
for you. She's one of your whores.

1209
01:28:29,040 --> 01:28:32,077
- A vulgar term.
- Why's she seeing Bud White?

1210
01:28:32,440 --> 01:28:35,796
Why do men and women
usually see each other?

1211
01:28:38,720 --> 01:28:41,109
Let's try this on for size:
Fleur-de-Lis.

1212
01:28:41,720 --> 01:28:43,358
"Whatever you desire. "

1213
01:28:44,080 --> 01:28:45,433
An actor named...

1214
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:46,876
...Matt Reynolds.

1215
01:28:48,600 --> 01:28:49,476
Nothing?

1216
01:28:52,560 --> 01:28:54,198
We want some answers.

1217
01:28:56,920 --> 01:28:58,592
We all want something.

1218
01:29:00,920 --> 01:29:02,797
The guy's as cool as they come.

1219
01:29:05,240 --> 01:29:07,834
<i>Lieutenant Exley,
come in, please. Over.</i>

1220
01:29:09,040 --> 01:29:09,790
Exley.

1221
01:29:10,040 --> 01:29:12,793
<i>The coroner wants to talk to you.
He says he has your I.D.</i>

1222
01:29:13,440 --> 01:29:16,113
Tell him Sergeant Vincennes
is coming in to talk to him.

1223
01:29:16,480 --> 01:29:18,471
- I'll drop you at your car.
- Where are you going?

1224
01:29:18,840 --> 01:29:19,989
Lynn Bracken's.

1225
01:29:20,440 --> 01:29:24,752
To find out why Patchett has her seeing
Bud White. See you at the Frolic Room.

1226
01:29:25,560 --> 01:29:28,632
Oh, great. You get the girl.
I get the coroner.

1227
01:29:38,360 --> 01:29:41,113
Hush-Hush, off the record
and on the q. t.

1228
01:29:44,760 --> 01:29:47,228
I was just coming to see you.
Got that I.D.?

1229
01:29:47,480 --> 01:29:51,678
Thank God for dental records.
Stiff used to be a cop. Leland Meeks.

1230
01:29:51,920 --> 01:29:52,796
Buzz Meeks?

1231
01:29:53,040 --> 01:29:54,314
- You knew him?
- Of him.

1232
01:29:54,560 --> 01:29:58,075
He was around when I joined the force.
Bad rep. Thanks.

1233
01:29:58,680 --> 01:29:59,874
"Just the facts. "

1234
01:30:00,120 --> 01:30:01,712
"Just the facts. "

1235
01:30:05,080 --> 01:30:05,956
Anything else?

1236
01:30:06,320 --> 01:30:10,029
Leland Meeks worked Vice '39-'41.
I need to see his arrest records.

1237
01:30:16,960 --> 01:30:17,790
Miss Bracken...

1238
01:30:18,160 --> 01:30:19,309
...I'm Lieutenant Exley.

1239
01:30:19,680 --> 01:30:20,635
I know.

1240
01:30:21,080 --> 01:30:23,036
Bud told me all about you.

1241
01:30:23,480 --> 01:30:24,515
Is that so?

1242
01:30:25,600 --> 01:30:27,397
And what did White have to say?

1243
01:30:28,920 --> 01:30:30,717
He said you were smart.

1244
01:30:31,480 --> 01:30:34,995
He also said you were a coward, and that
you'd screw yourself to get ahead.

1245
01:30:35,760 --> 01:30:37,751
Let's concentrate on my smarts.

1246
01:30:38,200 --> 01:30:42,830
Pierce Patchett made you, didn't he?
Taught you how to dress, talk and think.

1247
01:30:43,960 --> 01:30:45,712
And I'm impressed with the results.

1248
01:30:47,120 --> 01:30:48,269
But I need answers.

1249
01:30:48,640 --> 01:30:51,473
And if I don't get them,
I'll take you and Patchett down.

1250
01:30:52,240 --> 01:30:54,674
Pierce Patchett
can take care of himself.

1251
01:30:55,840 --> 01:30:57,592
And I'm not afraid of you.

1252
01:30:58,560 --> 01:31:00,949
And you forget one thing, Lieutenant...

1253
01:31:01,440 --> 01:31:03,795
...Pierce also taught me how to fuck.

1254
01:31:07,520 --> 01:31:09,192
And he tells you who to fuck.

1255
01:31:09,680 --> 01:31:11,477
Why are you fucking Bud White?

1256
01:31:11,840 --> 01:31:14,718
What makes you think
I'm not seeing Bud because I want to?

1257
01:31:16,480 --> 01:31:19,552
It would be easier for you
if there was an angle, wouldn't it?

1258
01:31:20,440 --> 01:31:23,193
You're afraid of Bud because you can't
figure out how to play him.

1259
01:31:24,440 --> 01:31:27,398
He doesn't follow
the same rules of politics as you do.

1260
01:31:28,240 --> 01:31:29,798
It makes him dangerous.

1261
01:31:30,160 --> 01:31:31,195
I can handle Bud White.

1262
01:31:31,640 --> 01:31:32,595
Can you?

1263
01:31:36,600 --> 01:31:38,591
I see Bud because I want to.

1264
01:31:42,040 --> 01:31:45,112
I see Bud because
he can't hide the good inside of him.

1265
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:49,514
I see Bud because he makes me feel
like Lynn Bracken...

1266
01:31:49,880 --> 01:31:52,952
...and not a Veronica Lake
look-alike who fucks for money.

1267
01:31:55,160 --> 01:31:59,153
I see Bud because he doesn't
know how to disguise who he is.

1268
01:32:01,240 --> 01:32:04,596
I see Bud for all the ways
he's different from you.

1269
01:32:07,040 --> 01:32:08,917
Don't underestimate me.

1270
01:32:09,560 --> 01:32:12,313
The way you've
underestimated Bud White?

1271
01:32:18,640 --> 01:32:21,200
Fucking me and fucking Bud
aren't the same thing.

1272
01:32:21,720 --> 01:32:23,517
Stop talking about Bud White.

1273
01:32:47,520 --> 01:32:49,238
Come on.

1274
01:32:51,960 --> 01:32:53,075
Shit.

1275
01:33:06,040 --> 01:33:07,553
Jack Vincennes.

1276
01:33:08,600 --> 01:33:10,079
It's going on midnight.

1277
01:33:10,560 --> 01:33:12,152
I need 2 minutes, Dudley.

1278
01:33:12,640 --> 01:33:13,595
It's important.

1279
01:33:14,360 --> 01:33:18,399
Good thing for you my wife and daughters
are at the beach in Santa Barbara.

1280
01:33:21,560 --> 01:33:23,915
Do you remember Buzz Meeks?

1281
01:33:24,200 --> 01:33:26,316
A disgrace as a police officer.

1282
01:33:26,680 --> 01:33:30,559
Straight D fitness reports from every
C.O. He ever served under. Why?

1283
01:33:31,320 --> 01:33:33,959
12 years ago, he was on a vice roust
with Dick Stensland.

1284
01:33:34,320 --> 01:33:37,357
They questioned Pierce Patchett
about a blackmail scam.

1285
01:33:37,720 --> 01:33:41,599
Patchett had Sid Hudgens photographing
prominent businessmen with hookers.

1286
01:33:42,360 --> 01:33:45,079
Anyway, charges were dropped.
Insufficient evidence.

1287
01:33:45,440 --> 01:33:49,592
You were the supervising officer on
that case. Remember anything about it?

1288
01:33:50,960 --> 01:33:52,313
What's this about, boyo?

1289
01:33:53,200 --> 01:33:56,590
It has to do with a murder
I've been working with Exley on.

1290
01:33:57,080 --> 01:33:59,469
You're Narco, Jack, not Homicide.

1291
01:33:59,840 --> 01:34:01,751
Since when do you work with Exley?

1292
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:05,150
It's a private investigation.

1293
01:34:07,280 --> 01:34:09,635
I messed something up.
I'm trying to make amends.

1294
01:34:09,880 --> 01:34:13,429
Don't start trying to do the right
thing. You haven't had the practice.

1295
01:34:20,800 --> 01:34:23,519
Buzz Meeks and Dick Stensland.

1296
01:34:26,640 --> 01:34:29,074
So, what does Exley make of this?

1297
01:34:29,720 --> 01:34:32,712
I haven't told him yet.
I just came from the records room.

1298
01:34:57,560 --> 01:34:59,551
Have you a valediction, boyo?

1299
01:35:05,720 --> 01:35:07,153
Rollo...

1300
01:35:08,280 --> 01:35:09,759
...Tomasi.

1301
01:35:29,920 --> 01:35:33,196
<i>Sergeant Vincennes was killed
by a.32 slug to the heart.</i>

1302
01:35:33,560 --> 01:35:35,676
<i>Time of death, approximately 1 a. m.</i>

1303
01:35:36,360 --> 01:35:41,354
Although he was found in Echo Park,
forensics indicates the body was moved.

1304
01:35:42,360 --> 01:35:45,477
I want 2-man teams to scour
that entire neighborhood.

1305
01:35:46,520 --> 01:35:48,670
Our justice must be swift...

1306
01:35:49,040 --> 01:35:50,439
...and merciless.

1307
01:35:52,640 --> 01:35:53,550
That is all.

1308
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:04,752
Might I have a word with you?

1309
01:36:07,920 --> 01:36:10,673
We're trying to run down a lead
on an associate of Vincennes.

1310
01:36:11,040 --> 01:36:13,600
The records check has led to a dead end.

1311
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:15,035
What's the name?

1312
01:36:15,480 --> 01:36:16,799
Rollo Tomasi?

1313
01:36:18,800 --> 01:36:20,597
You ever heard Vincennes mention him?

1314
01:36:23,480 --> 01:36:24,959
No. No, I haven't.

1315
01:36:29,560 --> 01:36:31,391
It's probably nothing. Still...

1316
01:36:32,600 --> 01:36:34,431
...keep your eyes open, boyo.

1317
01:36:44,320 --> 01:36:46,788
I know it's unlikely, but suppose...

1318
01:36:47,160 --> 01:36:50,391
...somebody had a lot of heroin,
who would they go to to move it?

1319
01:36:50,960 --> 01:36:52,837
White, in my office.

1320
01:36:53,200 --> 01:36:55,555
Captain. Look, just give me a name.

1321
01:36:56,440 --> 01:36:57,589
Mickey Cohen.

1322
01:37:03,480 --> 01:37:04,356
Captain?

1323
01:37:04,600 --> 01:37:06,989
I could use your fearsome
habits at the Victory Motel.

1324
01:37:08,440 --> 01:37:09,429
When?

1325
01:37:10,840 --> 01:37:11,795
Now.

1326
01:37:14,040 --> 01:37:15,519
Close the door, lad.

1327
01:37:22,840 --> 01:37:25,593
You're a bit of a
puzzlement to me these days.

1328
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:28,070
You don't seem your old cruel self.

1329
01:37:28,760 --> 01:37:31,513
And I had such grand plans
for your future.

1330
01:37:31,760 --> 01:37:32,795
What plans?

1331
01:37:34,320 --> 01:37:38,029
You have your extracurricular
activities and I have mine.

1332
01:37:41,080 --> 01:37:43,992
We must have a clarification
session one of these days.

1333
01:37:45,080 --> 01:37:45,956
However...

1334
01:37:46,840 --> 01:37:47,955
...right now...

1335
01:37:48,600 --> 01:37:51,672
...we'll brace a man who may know
who killed Jack Vincennes.

1336
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:53,592
So the question is...

1337
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:55,433
...can I count on you, lad?

1338
01:37:55,680 --> 01:37:57,318
- Yes or no?
- Yes, sir.

1339
01:38:02,320 --> 01:38:05,869
I want to know everything you and
Vincennes talked about last night.

1340
01:38:06,160 --> 01:38:08,037
Start with the I.D. On the corpse.

1341
01:38:08,280 --> 01:38:09,235
An ex-cop.

1342
01:38:09,640 --> 01:38:11,312
Leland "Buzz" Meeks.

1343
01:38:11,680 --> 01:38:12,795
An ex-cop?

1344
01:38:13,440 --> 01:38:14,759
Did Jack know him?

1345
01:38:15,480 --> 01:38:17,232
Only by reputation.

1346
01:38:23,200 --> 01:38:25,236
Wendell, this is Sid Hudgens.

1347
01:38:25,480 --> 01:38:28,074
I'm willing to cooperate.
No need to tie me down.

1348
01:38:28,440 --> 01:38:30,078
It's for your own safety.

1349
01:38:30,920 --> 01:38:34,117
What can you tell us
about Sgt. Jack Vincennes?

1350
01:38:34,360 --> 01:38:36,351
Hollywood Jack? The Big V?

1351
01:38:36,760 --> 01:38:39,513
<i>I can tell you he's on
the night train to the Big Adios.</i>

1352
01:38:43,640 --> 01:38:46,916
I had nothing to do with him
getting killed, if that's what you mean.

1353
01:38:47,280 --> 01:38:50,989
- But you were business associates.
- What's that got to do with anything?

1354
01:38:52,840 --> 01:38:54,831
Okay, so we worked together.

1355
01:38:55,440 --> 01:38:57,351
It was an information exchange.

1356
01:38:57,600 --> 01:39:01,673
I got him first-class collars, he got me
good stories. We were friends.

1357
01:39:02,040 --> 01:39:03,439
We'll drop that for now.

1358
01:39:03,920 --> 01:39:05,672
What about Pierce Patchett?

1359
01:39:05,920 --> 01:39:09,708
You think he had something to do
with Vincennes getting iced?

1360
01:39:10,600 --> 01:39:13,592
I'd like full and docile
cooperation on every topic.

1361
01:39:14,280 --> 01:39:16,555
Okay, okay, okay. All right.

1362
01:39:18,160 --> 01:39:20,833
Everyone knows Patchett's
worth a boatload.

1363
01:39:21,360 --> 01:39:22,998
But he has hobbies too.

1364
01:39:23,360 --> 01:39:25,715
He bankrolls B movies under the table.

1365
01:39:26,240 --> 01:39:27,673
And try this one on.

1366
01:39:28,040 --> 01:39:30,110
He's rumored to be a heroin sniffer.

1367
01:39:30,360 --> 01:39:33,158
All in all, a powerful
behind-the-scenes strange-o.

1368
01:39:33,440 --> 01:39:35,271
- And?
- And what?

1369
01:39:39,280 --> 01:39:42,750
Reciprocity, Mr. Hudgens,
is the key to every relationship.

1370
01:39:45,920 --> 01:39:47,353
He runs call girls.

1371
01:39:49,280 --> 01:39:52,113
Primo tail fixed up
to look like movie stars.

1372
01:39:54,880 --> 01:39:55,710
And?

1373
01:39:56,320 --> 01:39:57,719
Blackmail shit.

1374
01:39:58,600 --> 01:40:00,670
In my car, in the trunk,
under the rug...

1375
01:40:01,560 --> 01:40:05,553
Patchett got me to photograph this cop
screwing this gorgeous slut named Lynn.

1376
01:40:05,800 --> 01:40:07,791
She looks just like Veronica Lake.

1377
01:40:09,240 --> 01:40:09,990
Leave him!

1378
01:40:10,240 --> 01:40:11,753
I said leave him be!

1379
01:40:12,120 --> 01:40:13,394
Get him away from me!

1380
01:40:14,600 --> 01:40:15,430
Back off!

1381
01:40:57,920 --> 01:41:02,550
I wouldn't trade places with Exley right
now for all the whiskey in Ireland.

1382
01:41:06,560 --> 01:41:10,030
Dudley, I thought you were going to
let the dumb bastard kill me!

1383
01:41:10,840 --> 01:41:12,910
Learn to pull your punches
a little better.

1384
01:41:13,280 --> 01:41:15,157
You can uncuff me now, fellas.

1385
01:41:20,720 --> 01:41:21,869
Fellas...

1386
01:41:23,760 --> 01:41:24,636
...we had a deal.

1387
01:41:24,880 --> 01:41:26,313
You, me, Patchett. We're a team.

1388
01:41:31,280 --> 01:41:32,474
Hush-hush.

1389
01:41:33,680 --> 01:41:35,477
- Anything?
- Nothing.

1390
01:41:35,840 --> 01:41:38,354
Meeks never made an arrest
the entire time he worked Vice?

1391
01:41:38,720 --> 01:41:40,438
Someone must've pulled the files.

1392
01:41:43,040 --> 01:41:44,758
What about the daily report books?

1393
01:41:45,120 --> 01:41:48,078
- They'd be buried in the basement.
- Find them.

1394
01:42:17,880 --> 01:42:19,313
You talk to Exley?

1395
01:42:19,880 --> 01:42:21,438
Come in out of the rain.

1396
01:42:23,520 --> 01:42:25,397
What happened with Exley?

1397
01:42:27,160 --> 01:42:28,354
Just come in.

1398
01:42:29,760 --> 01:42:32,228
Will you tell me
what happened with Exley?

1399
01:42:32,880 --> 01:42:34,074
We talked.

1400
01:42:34,720 --> 01:42:35,789
Tell me about him.

1401
01:42:36,040 --> 01:42:37,029
Later.

1402
01:42:37,960 --> 01:42:38,949
Now!

1403
01:42:42,120 --> 01:42:43,599
You fucked him.

1404
01:42:47,160 --> 01:42:48,434
You fucked him.

1405
01:42:49,240 --> 01:42:51,151
I thought I was helping you.

1406
01:43:40,120 --> 01:43:42,270
I'm glad you're here.
I need you to see this.

1407
01:43:51,520 --> 01:43:52,430
Wait.

1408
01:44:18,200 --> 01:44:19,553
Dudley killed Jack.

1409
01:44:20,280 --> 01:44:21,918
He wants you to kill me.

1410
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:26,911
He showed you the photo, didn't he?

1411
01:44:27,720 --> 01:44:28,675
Didn't he?

1412
01:44:31,240 --> 01:44:33,117
Think! Goddamn you, think!

1413
01:44:35,760 --> 01:44:36,795
Get out!

1414
01:44:52,600 --> 01:44:54,716
I checked the daily report books.

1415
01:44:55,800 --> 01:44:58,997
Dudley, Buzz Meeks and
Stensland go way back.

1416
01:45:02,560 --> 01:45:04,232
I knew Stensland lied to me.

1417
01:45:07,240 --> 01:45:10,073
Lefferts' mother I.D.'d
him as Lefferts' boyfriend.

1418
01:45:11,880 --> 01:45:16,158
Stensland pretended he didn't know
Meeks or her the night that I met...

1419
01:45:17,560 --> 01:45:18,595
...Lynn.

1420
01:45:19,600 --> 01:45:20,953
Stensland and Meeks...

1421
01:45:21,600 --> 01:45:23,033
...what were they up to?

1422
01:45:23,960 --> 01:45:27,157
I don't know. But I think
Stens killed Meeks over heroin.

1423
01:45:27,680 --> 01:45:28,669
What heroin?

1424
01:45:34,480 --> 01:45:37,790
Johnny Stompanato told me
that Meeks had heroin for sale.

1425
01:45:38,200 --> 01:45:39,713
Meeks ends up dead.

1426
01:45:40,280 --> 01:45:42,316
Stensland dies at the Nite Owl.

1427
01:45:43,240 --> 01:45:44,832
It wasn't the Negroes.

1428
01:45:45,880 --> 01:45:47,757
The rape victim lied.

1429
01:45:48,280 --> 01:45:51,636
The first guys to the Mercury coupe
were Breuning and Carlisle.

1430
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:53,319
Dudley's guys.

1431
01:45:53,840 --> 01:45:55,512
They planted the shotguns.

1432
01:45:55,760 --> 01:45:59,036
They'd have killed the Negroes too
if Jack and I hadn't shown up.

1433
01:45:59,880 --> 01:46:02,952
Dudley framed them because
they were Negroes and had records.

1434
01:46:03,240 --> 01:46:05,595
He knew there'd be no questions asked...

1435
01:46:07,080 --> 01:46:09,389
...if they were killed resisting arrest.

1436
01:46:10,360 --> 01:46:12,590
Somehow it's all connected
to Jack's angle.

1437
01:46:13,240 --> 01:46:14,514
Sid Hudgens...

1438
01:46:15,080 --> 01:46:17,116
...the pictures to blackmail
Ellis Loew...

1439
01:46:18,240 --> 01:46:19,434
A kid got murdered.

1440
01:46:20,560 --> 01:46:22,630
To figure it out,
we must work together.

1441
01:46:28,120 --> 01:46:29,758
Why are you doing this?

1442
01:46:31,680 --> 01:46:33,318
The Nite Owl made you.

1443
01:46:35,160 --> 01:46:36,718
You want to tear all that down?

1444
01:46:38,280 --> 01:46:39,872
With a wrecking ball.

1445
01:46:40,480 --> 01:46:42,198
Want to help me swing it?

1446
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:55,911
Let's go see Ellis Loew.

1447
01:46:56,480 --> 01:46:59,040
Find out what
the District Attorney knows.

1448
01:47:06,800 --> 01:47:08,358
You can't go in there.

1449
01:47:10,560 --> 01:47:13,632
- Want me to call the police, Mr. Loew?
- Ask for Capt. Dudley Smith.

1450
01:47:13,840 --> 01:47:17,435
Tell him we're discussing an unemployed
actor's death at a Sunset Strip motel.

1451
01:47:17,680 --> 01:47:18,669
These are the police.

1452
01:47:25,160 --> 01:47:26,309
What do you want?

1453
01:47:26,560 --> 01:47:30,633
I want D.A. Bureau men to tail Dudley
Smith and Patchett 24 hours a day.

1454
01:47:30,920 --> 01:47:34,117
I want you to get a judge to authorize
wiretaps on their home phones.

1455
01:47:34,360 --> 01:47:36,555
I want authorization
to check their bank records.

1456
01:47:37,080 --> 01:47:38,433
On what evidence?

1457
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:40,638
Call it a hunch.

1458
01:47:41,800 --> 01:47:43,438
Absolutely not.

1459
01:47:43,680 --> 01:47:46,478
Dudley Smith is a highly-decorated
member of the department.

1460
01:47:46,720 --> 01:47:48,597
I won't smear his and
Patchett's name without...

1461
01:47:48,840 --> 01:47:50,159
Without what?

1462
01:47:50,560 --> 01:47:52,198
Them smearing yours first?

1463
01:47:52,560 --> 01:47:56,075
What do they have? Pictures of you
and Matt Reynolds with your pants down?

1464
01:47:58,360 --> 01:47:59,349
You have proof?

1465
01:48:00,040 --> 01:48:01,678
The proof had his throat slit.

1466
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:05,070
So far, you're not denying it.

1467
01:48:06,360 --> 01:48:08,237
I won't dignify this with answers.

1468
01:48:08,480 --> 01:48:10,789
Now if you gentlemen will excuse me...

1469
01:48:11,040 --> 01:48:14,715
...I have a press conference for Jack
Vincennes that I have to prepare for.

1470
01:48:24,640 --> 01:48:28,349
Unless you came to wipe my ass,
I believe we're through.

1471
01:48:32,840 --> 01:48:36,992
Don't pull that good-cop-bad-cop crap.
I practically invented it.

1472
01:48:37,760 --> 01:48:39,830
So what if some homo actor is dead.

1473
01:48:40,080 --> 01:48:42,992
Boys, girls. Ten of them
get off the bus to L.A. Everyday.

1474
01:48:50,600 --> 01:48:51,794
Pull him off me!

1475
01:48:52,040 --> 01:48:52,870
I don't know how.

1476
01:48:56,720 --> 01:49:00,395
I know you think you're the A-number-one
hotshot, but here's the juice.

1477
01:49:00,640 --> 01:49:02,915
If I kill you, 10 lawyers
will take your place tomorrow.

1478
01:49:03,160 --> 01:49:04,912
They just won't come on a bus.

1479
01:49:18,280 --> 01:49:19,315
Okay!

1480
01:49:20,640 --> 01:49:22,756
Dudley and Patchett, they...

1481
01:49:23,840 --> 01:49:24,829
Oh, my God!

1482
01:49:25,120 --> 01:49:27,031
I wouldn't play ball so they set me up!

1483
01:49:27,280 --> 01:49:29,236
I gave in!
But the kid heard everything...

1484
01:49:30,680 --> 01:49:31,590
...so they killed him.

1485
01:49:31,840 --> 01:49:32,795
Why?

1486
01:49:33,160 --> 01:49:36,391
- What are Dudley and Patchett up to?
- Taking over Mickey Cohen's rackets.

1487
01:49:36,640 --> 01:49:40,394
Because of those pictures
I couldn't prosecute them!

1488
01:49:40,760 --> 01:49:42,034
Oh, Jesus!

1489
01:49:42,280 --> 01:49:43,156
Help me up!

1490
01:49:51,960 --> 01:49:53,996
Is that how you ran
the good-cop bad-cop?

1491
01:49:56,480 --> 01:49:57,595
Patchett?

1492
01:50:31,600 --> 01:50:34,114
Looks like his bodyguard
had a conflict of interest.

1493
01:50:40,280 --> 01:50:41,599
Suicide note.

1494
01:50:41,840 --> 01:50:46,038
Says he killed Jack because Jack had
figured out his pornography scam.

1495
01:50:46,280 --> 01:50:48,316
Slicing himself open wasn't his idea.

1496
01:50:49,720 --> 01:50:51,073
2 of his fingers are broken.

1497
01:50:51,320 --> 01:50:52,196
They held him there.

1498
01:50:54,360 --> 01:50:55,236
Or drugged him.

1499
01:50:58,560 --> 01:51:00,232
Dudley's tying up his loose ends.

1500
01:51:01,080 --> 01:51:02,308
Patchett's dead.

1501
01:51:02,560 --> 01:51:04,118
He sent you after me.

1502
01:51:05,720 --> 01:51:06,869
Lynn.

1503
01:51:07,960 --> 01:51:09,075
West Hollywood Sheriff.

1504
01:51:09,320 --> 01:51:12,039
- They're closer than we are.
- I'll get the car. Keys!

1505
01:51:19,240 --> 01:51:21,708
We took her to the station
for safekeeping.

1506
01:51:22,720 --> 01:51:26,076
Hold her as Joan Smith.
And no one sees her unless I okay it.

1507
01:51:26,840 --> 01:51:28,478
Someone worked her over.

1508
01:51:28,720 --> 01:51:30,278
She wouldn't say who.

1509
01:51:35,240 --> 01:51:36,798
See you, Exley.

1510
01:51:39,880 --> 01:51:41,313
We should talk to Lynn.

1511
01:51:42,280 --> 01:51:43,429
You do it.

1512
01:51:44,080 --> 01:51:45,149
What will you do?

1513
01:51:48,280 --> 01:51:50,111
I'm going to talk to Sid Hudgens.

1514
01:51:50,840 --> 01:51:53,354
Compliment him on his
performance at the Victory Motel.

1515
01:51:53,600 --> 01:51:55,670
Remember, Bud, we need evidence.

1516
01:51:56,840 --> 01:51:58,239
I'll get the evidence.

1517
01:52:10,280 --> 01:52:11,235
Are you okay?

1518
01:52:13,880 --> 01:52:14,835
You okay?

1519
01:52:25,080 --> 01:52:26,957
Bud hates himself for what he did.

1520
01:52:28,200 --> 01:52:30,111
I know how he feels.

1521
01:52:32,360 --> 01:52:35,079
I need to know what you
can give me on Dudley Smith.

1522
01:52:37,080 --> 01:52:39,389
He's a police captain
in business with Patchett.

1523
01:52:40,040 --> 01:52:41,519
I've never heard of him.

1524
01:52:45,560 --> 01:52:47,073
Do you have a place to stay?

1525
01:52:48,760 --> 01:52:50,193
I'll be okay.

1526
01:52:56,560 --> 01:52:58,790
Nobody goes in without official I.D.

1527
01:53:03,320 --> 01:53:04,912
It's okay. Let him through.

1528
01:53:08,360 --> 01:53:09,679
What happened?

1529
01:53:10,200 --> 01:53:13,078
Someone beat him to death,
and stole a bunch of files.

1530
01:53:13,320 --> 01:53:15,231
Must have dug up garbage
on the wrong guy.

1531
01:53:15,640 --> 01:53:17,517
We got it narrowed down
to 1000 suspects.

1532
01:53:18,760 --> 01:53:19,988
Sergeant White...

1533
01:53:20,920 --> 01:53:22,478
...dispatch got a call for you.

1534
01:53:22,720 --> 01:53:25,632
Lieutenant Exley wants you
to meet him at the Victory Motel.

1535
01:53:58,200 --> 01:53:59,713
You wanted to meet here?

1536
01:54:01,720 --> 01:54:04,632
- You called it. I thought Hudgens was...
- Hudgens is dead.

1537
01:54:15,600 --> 01:54:17,079
Let's get out of here.

1538
01:54:24,200 --> 01:54:25,519
It's too late.

1539
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:14,991
You figured it was a set-up
but came anyway?

1540
01:55:15,240 --> 01:55:17,151
A lot of bad stuff happened here.

1541
01:55:17,680 --> 01:55:19,796
It's as good a place as any
for it to end.

1542
01:55:29,680 --> 01:55:30,669
Clip.

1543
01:55:35,600 --> 01:55:38,194
All I ever wanted
was to measure up to my father.

1544
01:55:39,240 --> 01:55:40,116
Now's your chance.

1545
01:55:42,760 --> 01:55:44,512
He died in the line of duty, didn't he?

1546
01:57:39,280 --> 01:57:40,429
Goddamn it!

1547
01:58:38,120 --> 01:58:38,791
You okay?

1548
01:58:39,680 --> 01:58:40,829
Yeah.

1549
01:58:58,600 --> 01:59:00,511
Come on. Easy.

1550
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:07,830
Move!

1551
01:59:29,680 --> 01:59:31,033
Rollo Tomasi.

1552
01:59:34,360 --> 01:59:35,679
Who is he?

1553
01:59:36,480 --> 01:59:37,515
You are.

1554
01:59:39,720 --> 01:59:41,472
You're the guy who gets away with it.

1555
01:59:45,440 --> 01:59:46,475
Jack knew it.

1556
01:59:46,720 --> 01:59:47,948
And so do I.

1557
02:00:12,640 --> 02:00:14,278
Are you going to shoot me...

1558
02:00:15,520 --> 02:00:16,509
...or arrest me?

1559
02:00:22,640 --> 02:00:23,834
Good lad.

1560
02:00:24,640 --> 02:00:26,471
Always the politician.

1561
02:00:27,080 --> 02:00:28,832
Let me do the talking.

1562
02:00:29,440 --> 02:00:32,352
After I'm done, they'll make you
Chief of Detectives.

1563
02:00:59,080 --> 02:01:00,718
Hold up your badge...

1564
02:01:01,000 --> 02:01:02,831
...so they'll know you're a policeman.

1565
02:01:51,320 --> 02:01:54,039
<i>You think you can talk
your way out of this, Lieutenant?</i>

1566
02:01:56,560 --> 02:01:57,675
No...

1567
02:01:57,920 --> 02:01:59,433
...but I can tell the truth.

1568
02:02:00,440 --> 02:02:02,192
During our investigation...

1569
02:02:03,280 --> 02:02:06,238
...of events surrounding
the Nite Owl case...

1570
02:02:07,280 --> 02:02:10,556
...Jack Vincennes, Bud White
and I learned the following:

1571
02:02:11,280 --> 02:02:13,635
Your golden boy's
throwing his whole life away.

1572
02:02:13,880 --> 02:02:15,313
The 3 Nite Owl suspects...

1573
02:02:16,240 --> 02:02:18,595
...while guilty of
kidnapping and rape...

1574
02:02:19,360 --> 02:02:22,238
...were innocent of the
multiple homicides at the Nite Owl.

1575
02:02:23,560 --> 02:02:25,391
The gunmen were most likely...

1576
02:02:25,640 --> 02:02:30,191
...Los Angeles police officers
Michael Breuning and William Carlisle...

1577
02:02:30,440 --> 02:02:31,839
...and a third man...

1578
02:02:32,520 --> 02:02:35,990
...who may or may not have been
Captain Dudley Smith.

1579
02:02:37,040 --> 02:02:38,439
The objective:

1580
02:02:39,360 --> 02:02:41,874
The elimination of
another police officer...

1581
02:02:42,120 --> 02:02:43,838
...Richard Stensland...

1582
02:02:44,720 --> 02:02:49,475
...who, along with former LAPD officer
Leland "Buzz" Meeks...

1583
02:02:50,520 --> 02:02:54,069
...also committed multiple homicides
on behalf of Captain Smith...

1584
02:02:54,720 --> 02:02:56,233
...and then betrayed him...

1585
02:02:56,520 --> 02:02:58,636
...over 25 pounds of heroin...

1586
02:02:59,720 --> 02:03:01,472
...the retrieval of which...

1587
02:03:01,760 --> 02:03:04,672
...was the ultimate motivation
behind the Nite Owl killings.

1588
02:03:07,760 --> 02:03:10,877
Beginning with the incarceration
of Mickey Cohen...

1589
02:03:11,280 --> 02:03:15,990
...Capt. Smith has been assuming control
of organized crime in Los Angeles.

1590
02:03:17,800 --> 02:03:21,349
This includes the assassinations
of Mickey Cohen lieutenants...

1591
02:03:21,920 --> 02:03:24,957
...the systematic blackmail
of city officials...

1592
02:03:26,520 --> 02:03:30,877
...and the murders of Susan Lefferts,
Pierce Patchett, Sid Hudgens...

1593
02:03:32,240 --> 02:03:34,231
...and Sergeant Jack Vincennes.

1594
02:03:37,360 --> 02:03:40,079
Captain Smith admitted as much to me...

1595
02:03:40,680 --> 02:03:42,511
...before I shot him...

1596
02:03:42,880 --> 02:03:44,598
...at the Victory Motel.

1597
02:03:46,720 --> 02:03:47,789
That's it.

1598
02:03:52,520 --> 02:03:54,431
The press will have a field day.

1599
02:03:56,000 --> 02:03:57,353
Christ!

1600
02:03:57,600 --> 02:03:59,795
Itll stain the Department for years.

1601
02:04:00,040 --> 02:04:00,870
Decades.

1602
02:04:02,160 --> 02:04:04,628
If we can get the kid to play ball...

1603
02:04:05,640 --> 02:04:07,358
...who's to say what happened?

1604
02:04:08,440 --> 02:04:10,795
Maybe Dudley Smith died a hero.

1605
02:04:11,040 --> 02:04:13,508
- Good idea.
- If we get the press to play.

1606
02:04:21,040 --> 02:04:23,634
<i>Want to tell me what
you're smiling about?</i>

1607
02:04:28,880 --> 02:04:30,074
A hero.

1608
02:04:30,680 --> 02:04:32,272
How'd he know what we said?

1609
02:04:32,520 --> 02:04:34,078
He couldn't have heard us.

1610
02:04:37,760 --> 02:04:39,557
In this situation...

1611
02:04:39,920 --> 02:04:41,751
...you'll need more than one.

1612
02:04:48,440 --> 02:04:53,116
<i>It is my pleasure to present this award
to Detective Lieutenant Edmund Exley...</i>

1613
02:04:53,720 --> 02:04:55,676
<i>...two-time Medal of Valor recipient.</i>

1614
02:05:05,480 --> 02:05:09,268
Next year the LAPD
will move into its new facility.

1615
02:05:09,640 --> 02:05:11,232
With leaders like Edmund Exley...

1616
02:05:11,480 --> 02:05:14,438
...the image of fat cops stealing apples
will be left behind...

1617
02:05:14,680 --> 02:05:18,389
...and Los Angeles will finally
have the police force it deserves.

1618
02:05:31,760 --> 02:05:33,751
You just couldn't resist.

1619
02:05:34,040 --> 02:05:36,474
They're using me.
So for a while, I'm using them.

1620
02:05:38,440 --> 02:05:39,475
Come on.

1621
02:06:12,960 --> 02:06:14,188
Thanks for the push.

1622
02:06:35,120 --> 02:06:37,031
Congratulations, Lieutenant Exley.

1623
02:06:40,240 --> 02:06:42,231
Some men get the world...

1624
02:06:42,720 --> 02:06:46,156
...others get ex-hookers
and a trip to Arizona.

00:00:00,000 --> 00:01:00,000


2
00:01:35,888 --> 00:01:36,890
Ladies and Gentlemen...

3
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:39,223
We're beginning
our descent into Berlin-Tegel.

4
00:01:39,224 --> 00:01:41,367
Where local time is 8:30 am.

5
00:01:41,666 --> 00:01:43,350
and the temperature is at minus...

6
00:01:43,845 --> 00:01:44,206
Morning...

7
00:01:45,778 --> 00:01:46,669
- Did you sleep...?

8
00:01:47,058 --> 00:01:47,451
No..

9
00:01:48,059 --> 00:01:48,760
I'll sleep at the hotel.

10
00:01:51,235 --> 00:01:52,148
You'll do great.

11
00:01:54,121 --> 00:01:54,997
You always do.

12
00:02:09,508 --> 00:02:10,638
What's the purpose of your visit..?

13
00:02:11,049 --> 00:02:12,762
- We're here for a biotechnology summit.

14
00:02:12,824 --> 00:02:14,039
I'm giving a presentation.

15
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:20,530
Mr. and Mrs. Harris..

16
00:02:21,421 --> 00:02:22,189
Welcome to Berlin.

17
00:02:22,723 --> 00:02:23,453
Thank you so much...

18
00:02:27,793 --> 00:02:29,930
- I'm giving a presentation..?

19
00:02:30,424 --> 00:02:31,620
- Well, she asked.

20
00:02:35,701 --> 00:02:37,901
Ooh...Welcome to Berlin.

21
00:02:59,918 --> 00:03:01,694
Martin get in the car.
Let him do that.

22
00:03:41,819 --> 00:03:43,510
What do you think he's saying..?

23
00:03:44,403 --> 00:03:45,345
- No idea.

24
00:03:51,875 --> 00:03:54,720
- Oh look, Isabel Kronen is showing on Saturday.
- Oh yeah.

25
00:03:55,643 --> 00:03:57,438
- Remember when we saw her in Chicago?

26
00:03:58,003 --> 00:03:59,539
- Yes.

27
00:04:02,403 --> 00:04:07,303
Why don't I meet you there on Saturday
after my lunch with Professor Bressler.

28
00:04:07,565 --> 00:04:08,185
Yeah?

29
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,233
- If you promise.
- I promise.

30
00:04:45,092 --> 00:04:47,661
- Welcome to the Hotel Adlon Kempinski.
- Thank you.

31
00:04:47,662 --> 00:04:50,175
You take it in honey,
I'll take care of this.

32
00:04:50,176 --> 00:04:52,729
- Have you stayed with us before?
- First time in Berlin.

33
00:04:52,753 --> 00:04:53,807

00:05:09,293 --> 00:05:11,742
- Wait, wait.
- Everything ok sir?

38
00:05:11,743 --> 00:05:14,351
- Is this everything from the taxi?
- Yes sir.

39
00:05:16,529 --> 00:05:20,388
I知 afraid Mrs. Harris but the Eisenhower
suite may not be available right now.

40
00:05:20,581 --> 00:05:22,210
What do you mean the suite may not be available?

41
00:05:22,307 --> 00:05:24,874
There have been some room changes
due to security reasons.

42
00:05:24,875 --> 00:05:28,324
- But we confirmed 2 weeks ago.
- Would you allow me to answer the phone.

43
00:05:30,265 --> 00:05:35,445
<i>Clerk speaking in German.</i>

44
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:04,883
Oh please. Excuse me driver.
Is there another route?

45
00:06:20,571 --> 00:06:22,167
Come on.

46
00:06:36,617 --> 00:06:37,520
Look out.

47
00:08:01,723 --> 00:08:02,797
Do you hear me?

48
00:09:44,138 --> 00:09:46,867
Doctor Farge. Doctor Farge.

49
00:09:52,209 --> 00:09:58,061
<i>Doctor speaking in German.</i>

50
00:09:58,756 --> 00:10:03,252
- I don't speak German.
- English?

51
00:10:04,422 --> 00:10:06,503
American.

52
00:10:07,901 --> 00:10:11,490
- You have been in an accident.
- Accident?

53
00:10:14,118 --> 00:10:16,507
Can you tell me your name?

54
00:10:18,189 --> 00:10:22,499
- Your name.
- Martin Harris.

55
00:10:23,788 --> 00:10:26,189
Doctor Martin Harris.

56
00:10:27,549 --> 00:10:31,983
Where's my wife Liz,
is she hurt?

57
00:10:31,984 --> 00:10:34,990
- Is she hurt? Where is she?
- Doctor Harris it's alright.

58
00:10:35,013 --> 00:10:39,338
You were the only passenger. The
taxi went into the river.

59
00:10:39,449 --> 00:10:41,519
Your heart stopped for several minutes.

60
00:10:42,143 --> 00:10:46,619
It's Thursday November 24th.
You have been in a coma for 4 days.

61
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:51,402
Thanksgiving .. but my wife
she's in Berlin with me.

62
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:53,701
Where is she?
Why isn't she here?

63
00:10:53,702 --> 00:10:57,345
We couldn't find any identification
with you Doctor Harris.

64
00:10:57,687 --> 00:11:00,854
- No no no please calm down.
- Call her.

65
00:11:00,855 --> 00:11:04,563
Where can we reach your wife.
Does she have a cell phone?

66
00:11:04,564 --> 00:11:07,298
Of course she has a cell phone.
It's you um ..

67
00:11:13,743 --> 00:11:19,052
- I can't remember.
- Can you tell me what you do remember Martin?

68
00:11:19,823 --> 00:11:25,353
Bits and pieces. Arriving at the airport,
getting in a taxi with Liz.

69
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:29,054
I don't know how I got here.

70
00:11:29,055 --> 00:11:32,161
There are no rules with severe
trauma of this kind.

71
00:11:32,162 --> 00:11:35,350
Memories get lost or fractured.
Most of them return.

72
00:11:35,351 --> 00:11:39,917
Although it's unlikely you will ever fully
recall the events around your accident.

73
00:11:39,918 --> 00:11:44,474
In the mean time let us see if anyone has
filed a report looking for Martin Harris.

74
00:11:44,475 --> 00:11:46,829
Yes, yes, yes.

75
00:11:57,343 --> 00:12:00,685
Good evening . Welcome to BNI world news.

76
00:12:02,618 --> 00:12:05,443
Brought this for you .

77
00:12:06,028 --> 00:12:10,845
Has anybody been looking for me?
My wife .. Mein Frau.

78
00:12:42,686 --> 00:12:44,534
Come here you.

79
00:12:50,042 --> 00:12:53,621
- It's beautiful, just beautiful.
- I知 glad you  like it.

80
00:12:58,267 --> 00:13:03,721
She gave it to me as a gift
in Paris for our honeymoon.

81
00:13:42,007 --> 00:13:46,835
Prince Shada arrived in Berlin today for
this years biotechnology global summit

82
00:13:46,917 --> 00:13:49,238
The personal attendance of the
flamboyant prince has fueled

83
00:13:49,239 --> 00:13:56,148
speculation that the summit, now in it's tenth year, will
witness the announcement of a major scientific breakthrough.

84
00:13:56,333 --> 00:14:01,164
With the worlds leading researchers convening
at the luxurious Hotel Adlon in central Berlin.

85
00:14:01,227 --> 00:14:03,353

88
00:14:09,448 --> 00:14:12,787
- You have to realize the risk.
- Doctor!

89
00:14:12,788 --> 00:14:15,917
I've been gone for 4 days. My wife is out
there in a city she doesn't know.

90
00:14:15,918 --> 00:14:18,680
She'd be terrified. I need to find her.

91
00:14:21,952 --> 00:14:26,245
Sign this. It releases you from my care.

92
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:29,737
And here's my card.

93
00:14:29,738 --> 00:14:33,719

00:15:02,618 --> 00:15:04,944
May I please see some ID Mr. Harris.

100
00:15:05,263 --> 00:15:08,788
There's been a situation.
I lost my passport.

101
00:15:09,257 --> 00:15:11,280
I知 going to need some ID sir.

102
00:15:11,281 --> 00:15:14,047
If you  get someone to escort me to my room,
I can prove it.

103
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:16,596

116
00:16:26,091 --> 00:16:30,208
I have been missing for 4 days
and she has no idea what happened to me.

117
00:16:30,208 --> 00:16:32,777
So I need you to take me to her right now.

118
00:16:38,261 --> 00:16:40,578
- Ok.
- Thank you

119
00:16:42,169 --> 00:16:44,955
- The lady in the dark dress.
- Ok.

120
00:16:47,445 --> 00:16:52,873
Excuse me madam. Your husband is here.

121
00:16:53,553 --> 00:16:56,778
Liz. Oh Jesus...

122
00:16:57,114 --> 00:17:00,251
Excuse me. Do I know you?

123
00:17:04,641 --> 00:17:07,878
Liz, what's wrong? I知 sorry ..

124
00:17:08,075 --> 00:17:12,325
I was in an accident. I was in a coma.
They didn't know who I was.

125
00:17:15,778 --> 00:17:17,986
I said I知 sorry.

126
00:17:18,456 --> 00:17:21,329
You must have me confused
with someone else.

127
00:17:22,641 --> 00:17:26,902
Liz. It's me, Martin.

128
00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:29,448
Your husband.

129
00:17:31,852 --> 00:17:34,909
This is a misunderstanding
I don't know this man.

130
00:17:35,968 --> 00:17:40,002
Martin .. This is my husband.

131
00:17:40,272 --> 00:17:44,263
You are Dr. Martin Harris?
Last time I looked.

132
00:17:44,264 --> 00:17:46,071
Yup .. still me.

133
00:17:48,779 --> 00:17:51,528
What痴 going on here?
Is this some kind of a joke?

134
00:17:52,367 --> 00:17:56,179
- Joke about what?
- Because it's not very funny.

135
00:17:56,347 --> 00:17:58,852
- Do you know this man?
- No.

136
00:17:59,753 --> 00:18:02,096
Who the hell are you?

137
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:04,995
Who the hell are you?

138
00:18:05,702 --> 00:18:09,884
- I知 her husband.
- Ok .. ok.

139
00:18:10,268 --> 00:18:13,468
Would you mind just getting him away from us.
Please.

140
00:18:13,854 --> 00:18:15,892
Liz, please stop this.

141
00:18:15,893 --> 00:18:17,740
- Hey, hey, please.
- Get your hands off me.

142
00:18:17,741 --> 00:18:19,793
- Why don't you just back off.
- Liz what's going on?

143
00:18:19,794 --> 00:18:21,602
- Back off.
- What's this all about?

144
00:18:21,603 --> 00:18:23,924
- Why don't you just take a walk.
- Gentleman please.

145
00:18:26,718 --> 00:18:28,997
If you  don't leave now
we have to call the police.

146
00:18:28,998 --> 00:18:31,195
Call the police. Call the goddam army.

147
00:18:31,196 --> 00:18:33,697
That's a good idea. Liz, what's
happening here?

148
00:18:33,698 --> 00:18:35,539
- You're embarrassing me. Please.
- Get him out of here.

149
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:39,046
- Liz. I was hurt.
- Have a nice evening.

150
00:18:39,758 --> 00:18:42,155
Liz. Why are you doing this to me?

151
00:18:43,674 --> 00:18:45,886
Right there that's Liz.

152
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:49,756
And I .. am ..

153
00:18:50,434 --> 00:18:53,862
I must have been outside.
I can't remember ..

154
00:18:55,802 --> 00:18:58,050
Well, as you  can see .. you are not there.

155
00:18:58,051 --> 00:19:03,923
Immigration confirms the arrival of a
Dr. and Mrs. Harris on November 20th at 7:40 am.

156
00:19:03,924 --> 00:19:08,003
At 8:50, she checked into
the suite at the hotel.

157
00:19:08,004 --> 00:19:11,273
.. followed by Dr. Harris
at 3:00 in the afternoon.

158
00:19:11,565 --> 00:19:14,042
- What?
- Thank you.

159
00:19:15,381 --> 00:19:20,064
He's not Martin Harris.
I am Dr. Martin Harris.

160
00:19:20,528 --> 00:19:23,128
The man upstairs is pretending to be me.

161
00:19:23,129 --> 00:19:25,279
And this imposter .. did he also steal
your wife ?

162
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:30,983
- He must be forcing her or something.
- And why ? ..  Help me.

163
00:19:30,984 --> 00:19:33,775
- Why ?
- For god's sake. Just do an internet search.

164
00:19:33,776 --> 00:19:36,707
There are 400 Martin Harrises
in the United States.

165
00:19:36,707 --> 00:19:38,956
We already checked.

166
00:19:38,957 --> 00:19:42,562
Rod .. Rodney Cole.

167
00:19:42,563 --> 00:19:44,860
A colleague at Langmore in the states. A
dear friend. He can verify who I am.

168
00:19:44,861 --> 00:19:54,320
Please call him.  Uh
it's 001-508-146-2595.

169
00:19:56,210 --> 00:19:59,917
<i>- This is Dr. Cole. I'm having an  ..
- It's the answering machine.</i>

170
00:20:00,675 --> 00:20:04,291
Professor Bressler. Talk to him.
He痴 the reason I知 in Berlin.

171
00:20:04,542 --> 00:20:06,845
He invited me over to the summit to
discuss my thesis.

172
00:20:06,846 --> 00:20:08,849
- You know professor Bressler?
- Yes!

173
00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:14,317
Well we haven't actually met. But we've been
speaking on the phone. Emailing .. dozens of times.

174
00:20:17,603 --> 00:20:20,386
- Why don't you arrest him !
- For what?

175
00:20:20,738 --> 00:20:22,616
Entering the country legally

176
00:20:22,617 --> 00:20:26,664
Presenting all the correct documentation
and checking into the hotel suite with his wife.

177
00:20:26,853 --> 00:20:29,576
Excuse me.  With your wife.

178
00:20:30,218 --> 00:20:32,928
She is my wife.

179
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:36,702
Herr Strauss. I found a Dr. Martin
Harris at Langhorn University.

180
00:20:36,871 --> 00:20:39,421
Yes .. thank you.
That痴' what I've been trying ..

181
00:20:43,425 --> 00:20:44,432
Ok.

182
00:20:45,629 --> 00:20:47,958
Wait, wait, wait .. please wait ..

183
00:20:47,959 --> 00:20:51,462
You're going to arrest me ?
I demand to speak to my embassy.

184
00:20:51,463 --> 00:20:54,615
Unfortunately it is your Thanksgiving. The
embassy is closed until Monday.

185
00:21:01,678 --> 00:21:07,584
- Herr Strauss. Can I have a quiet word ..  please.
- Ok

186
00:21:11,208 --> 00:21:13,148
Listen.

187
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:19,108
You're probably right.

188
00:21:19,109 --> 00:21:24,745
The accident. I haven't been remembering
things very well.  I知 confused.

189
00:21:24,746 --> 00:21:28,073
This is my doctor at the hospital here
in Berlin.

190
00:21:28,074 --> 00:21:32,840
He warned me that this sort
of thing was gonna happen.

191
00:21:34,681 --> 00:21:40,435
I need to go back there .. now.
I知 so embarrassed.

192
00:21:41,130 --> 00:21:47,637
So, now you are saying
that you are not Dr. Martin Harris ?

193
00:21:47,638 --> 00:21:53,169
I don't know.

194
00:22:06,463 --> 00:22:09,363
Please take him to this address.

195
00:22:19,183 --> 00:22:22,680
Wait .. stop .. stop.
I've changed my mind.

196
00:23:31,459 --> 00:23:36,595
- Need passport.
- Please.

197
00:23:37,933 --> 00:23:41,618
Police .. very bad.

198
00:23:48,548 --> 00:23:53,967
This is doctor Cole. I知 having an out of office
experience right now. Please leave a message.

199
00:23:54,328 --> 00:23:58,516
Rodney. It's me, Martin.
Listen.  I知 in Berlin for the summit.

200
00:23:58,517 --> 00:24:05,320
But It's Liz.  She's .. I ..
I don't know what she's doing.

201
00:24:05,321 --> 00:24:11,875
Um .. there's another man involved.

202
00:24:12,579 --> 00:24:16,720
I知 in trouble Rod .. wait.

203
00:25:35,363 --> 00:25:36,697
Hold the door.

204
00:26:12,997 --> 00:26:15,586
12:30 pm

205
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:20,574
Professor Bressler.

206
00:26:22,013 --> 00:26:23,944
Lab - University. Welcome party
for Shada.

207
00:27:52,776 --> 00:27:55,139
He says he doesn't care
if she saved your life.

208
00:27:57,058 --> 00:28:00,012
The bitch cost him twenty thousand Euros.

209
00:28:02,313 --> 00:28:06,305
the insurance won't cover the cab and
she had no license.

210
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:12,153
He says illegal immigrants are
destroying German society.

211
00:28:14,552 --> 00:28:19,020
- So I知 guessing he doesn't know where she is.
- No one knows where she is.

212
00:28:22,693 --> 00:28:24,855
Thank him for his time.

213
00:28:27,501 --> 00:28:30,394
- Excuse me.
- Hey American. I知 sorry we couldn稚 help you.

214
00:28:30,395 --> 00:28:35,083
You know where she is. I can tell. Look I
just wanna thank her, she saved my life.

215
00:28:35,926 --> 00:28:39,056
I thought maybe I could give her some money.
I just wanna thank her.

216
00:28:40,366 --> 00:28:42,060
Please.

217
00:28:56,602 --> 00:28:59,293
You remember me?
I was in your taxi.

218
00:28:59,294 --> 00:29:01,124
I don't drive taxi.

219
00:29:01,411 --> 00:29:05,777
I was in your taxi. We crashed.
I need to know, where did you  pick me up ?

220
00:29:07,174 --> 00:29:09,353
Where was I going?
How did you find me?

221
00:29:09,354 --> 00:29:10,795
Your friend Biko.

222
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:12,641
Gina, stop talking and get back
to work.

223
00:29:13,404 --> 00:29:15,381
Please leave me alone.

224
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:21,049
- Please help me.
- Leave me alone.

225
00:29:22,549 --> 00:29:25,158
Thank's for saving me.

226
00:29:36,647 --> 00:29:39,577
Excuse me. I need to find
Professor Bressler's lab.

227
00:29:39,578 --> 00:29:42,316
- I have an appointment at 12:30.  I知 late.
- Your name please.

228
00:29:42,642 --> 00:29:45,020
Dr. Martin Harris.

229
00:29:48,382 --> 00:29:51,024
- Wait here please.
- The Professor knows who I am.

230
00:29:51,025 --> 00:29:53,123
We scheduled this appointment weeks ago.

231
00:30:30,186 --> 00:30:32,187
What are you  doing here?

232
00:30:32,364 --> 00:30:34,618
- Professor ..
- This laboratie's a restricted area. Who are you ?

233
00:30:34,619 --> 00:30:39,022
This man is not Martin Harris.
I am Dr. Martin Harris.

234
00:30:40,247 --> 00:30:45,514
- So what is this? There are two Martin Harris?
- No. Let me explain.

235
00:30:45,515 --> 00:30:48,506
This man showed up at my hotel
last night claiming to be me.

236
00:30:48,507 --> 00:30:51,404
- The police were called.
- I called the police you son of a bitch.

237
00:30:51,405 --> 00:30:54,608
He checked himself out of a hospital.
Seems he was in an accident.

238
00:30:54,609 --> 00:30:57,327
- Professor.
- Professor, should I call police?

239
00:30:57,328 --> 00:30:58,607
Yeah, thank you.

240
00:31:00,023 --> 00:31:02,396
We talked. You and I on the phone.

241
00:31:02,398 --> 00:31:04,653
We discussed your interest in
alternative forms of propagation.

242
00:31:04,654 --> 00:31:08,860
I told you  about my father. A school
teacher. His passion for science.

243
00:31:09,683 --> 00:31:11,242
We talked about your children.

244
00:31:11,243 --> 00:31:14,303
About how much time you spend with
them since you lost your wife

245
00:31:14,304 --> 00:31:16,690
Two girls, right?

246
00:31:16,691 --> 00:31:21,798
You told me their names.

247
00:31:21,798 --> 00:31:24,146
I know them. I know them.

248
00:31:24,431 --> 00:31:28,330
Laurel, Lily. Twins ten years old.

249
00:31:28,331 --> 00:31:29,884
About the same age I was ..

250
00:31:29,885 --> 00:31:32,422
.. when I told my father I
wanted to be a botanist.

251
00:31:32,423 --> 00:31:34,836
Do you remember Professor.
We talked about that on the phone.

252
00:31:34,837 --> 00:31:38,003
- How I'd never seen my father this happy?
- No.

253
00:31:38,004 --> 00:31:42,256
That wasn't you. Don't you remember we spoke
about how brave our wives were ..

254
00:31:42,290 --> 00:31:45,972
<i>- (together) .. to marry scientists.
- I told you about (together) our honeymoon in Paris.</i>

255
00:31:45,973 --> 00:31:47,467
My wife and I.

256
00:31:47,903 --> 00:31:50,919
And how she wanted to visit all the
museums.  All I wanted to do was go to the ..

257
00:31:50,943 --> 00:31:52,094
Les  ﾉcole Polytechnique.

258
00:31:52,118 --> 00:31:55,954
But she insisted.  And that's how I
first saw Leonardos' Vitruvian Man.

259
00:31:56,553 --> 00:31:57,704
Wow.

260
00:32:03,586 --> 00:32:05,973
- This is not happening.
- Professor the police are here.

261
00:32:05,974 --> 00:32:07,617
Moment.  Moment.

262
00:32:07,618 --> 00:32:11,892
I don't know who this man is.
But he has taken everything from me.

263
00:32:12,307 --> 00:32:14,400
You have to arrest him.

264
00:32:14,812 --> 00:32:16,714
Go on arrest him.

265
00:32:16,715 --> 00:32:20,304
I don't believe they need to do this.

266
00:32:51,014 --> 00:32:53,848
- Water ?
- No.

267
00:32:58,379 --> 00:33:00,298
Maybe I shouldn't do this .. but ..

268
00:33:13,004 --> 00:33:15,498
My friend .. he .. looks ..

269
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:23,201
He finds people.

270
00:33:28,411 --> 00:33:30,422
Martin.

271
00:33:30,456 --> 00:33:33,232
The mistake was mine. I should
have never let you leave.

272
00:33:33,233 --> 00:33:37,540
What's happening to me Doctor ?
Confusion, memory loss.

273
00:33:37,541 --> 00:33:39,614
Complete or partial loss of identity.

274
00:33:39,615 --> 00:33:42,331
These are common stages in recovery.

275
00:33:42,332 --> 00:33:47,484
A person can awaken from a coma convinced of
a reality that was previously only fantasy.

276
00:33:49,042 --> 00:33:50,961
We are going to sedate you now.

277
00:33:50,985 --> 00:33:53,862
Do another MRI.  Try to find out what's
going on, ok .

278
00:33:54,341 --> 00:33:58,262
If I知 not Martin Harris why
do I know so much about him?

279
00:33:59,414 --> 00:34:06,215
Perhaps he was someone you read about
or met once in passing.

280
00:34:08,348 --> 00:34:10,267
Do you know what it feels like to become
insane doctor ?

281
00:34:10,483 --> 00:34:15,277
It's like a war between being told
who you are ..

282
00:34:15,301 --> 00:34:17,220
.. and knowing who you are.

283
00:34:20,186 --> 00:34:23,109
Which do you think wins?

284
00:34:29,655 --> 00:34:39,245
<i>(Sound of MRI machine banging)</i>

285
00:35:28,073 --> 00:35:30,723
Hello Martin, this won't take very long.

286
00:36:03,355 --> 00:36:05,370
Excuse me.  Where are you taking this
patient ?

287
00:36:06,737 --> 00:36:10,957
I have instructions to move this patient to
the American Hospital in Wiesbaden.

288
00:36:10,981 --> 00:36:12,898
You can't take him until I get
confirmation.

289
00:36:12,922 --> 00:36:14,648
Here's the paperwork.

290
00:36:14,672 --> 00:36:16,591
Show me that.  I need to make a phone call.

291
00:39:08,789 --> 00:39:11,888
It's ok.  I'm feeling much much
better.

292
00:40:37,846 --> 00:40:39,139
Hello.

293
00:40:41,179 --> 00:40:42,631
Hello ? Hello ?

294
00:41:26,082 --> 00:41:27,579
- Herr Jurgen ?
- Yeah.

295
00:41:34,592 --> 00:41:37,703
- You met her?
- She looked after me in the hospital.

296
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:40,386
She was kind to me too.

297
00:41:40,851 --> 00:41:43,753
I知 sorry. She's dead.

298
00:41:47,808 --> 00:41:50,465
- Come in.
- Thank you.

299
00:42:01,715 --> 00:42:04,239
- Drink ?
- No thanks.

300
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:11,402
I was a former member of the Stasi.

301
00:42:11,663 --> 00:42:15,911
- The ministry for state security.
- East German secret police !

302
00:42:16,304 --> 00:42:19,389
Yes. Proudly !

303
00:42:30,434 --> 00:42:34,905
That's good.  I cannot drink any
longer but I like to forget it.

304
00:42:34,929 --> 00:42:37,063
We Germans are experts at forgetting.

305
00:42:37,112 --> 00:42:41,819
We've forgotten that we were Nazis.  Now we
have forgotten 40 years of communism.  All gone.

306
00:42:41,983 --> 00:42:46,218
But it's not just history that's
forgotten. It's people too.

307
00:42:46,671 --> 00:42:50,957
Please tell me more about
Nurse Gretchen Erfurt.

308
00:42:56,942 --> 00:42:58,448
Quite a story.

309
00:42:59,081 --> 00:43:01,492
For a moment they had me
convinced  I was crazy.

310
00:43:02,203 --> 00:43:05,783
But when they came to take me. When
they .. killed your friend.

311
00:43:05,866 --> 00:43:08,712
I knew.

312
00:43:10,935 --> 00:43:12,943
I知 not sure how I can be of service.

313
00:43:13,377 --> 00:43:17,237
I need you to help me prove I知 .. me.

314
00:43:19,578 --> 00:43:21,496
- May I ?
- Please.

315
00:43:22,848 --> 00:43:27,133
It's a gift from my father.
I always have it with me.

316
00:43:39,911 --> 00:43:43,801
- These mean anything to you?
- No. It's uh my wife's writing.

317
00:43:44,106 --> 00:43:45,545
So they mean something to her.

318
00:43:49,962 --> 00:43:53,076
It's my schedule for this week.
I wrote it from memory.

319
00:43:54,499 --> 00:43:58,856
Your wifes involvement in this. There
must have been something in the past.

320
00:43:59,549 --> 00:44:01,585
- A new friend.  An acquaintance ?
- No.

321
00:44:02,325 --> 00:44:06,776
- Unexplained absence.
- No. There was nothing. I would have know.

322
00:44:07,509 --> 00:44:12,479
- Men always like to think ..
- It's not Liz. I know her.

323
00:44:12,777 --> 00:44:14,637
Yet she does not know you.

324
00:44:15,220 --> 00:44:17,776
Look. Whoever's been doing this.
They've been planning it for some time.

325
00:44:17,831 --> 00:44:22,192
They have passports, credit cards ..
family photos for gods sake.

326
00:44:22,744 --> 00:44:24,799
I mean, this takes preparation doesn't it?

327
00:44:25,350 --> 00:44:29,216
They have detailed knowledge of my research.
My relationship with professor ..

328
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:32,981
As well as the fact that you were going
to have a random accident that would ..

329
00:44:33,060 --> 00:44:36,620
.. allow a stranger to seemlessly
take your place ?

330
00:44:36,846 --> 00:44:39,258
These people may be good
but they are not god.

331
00:44:39,918 --> 00:44:42,283
A little confirmation would be nice.

332
00:44:42,661 --> 00:44:44,801
Somewhere there's proof. They can't
have thought of everything.

333
00:44:45,165 --> 00:44:48,448
The question is why would they
want to take your place?

334
00:44:49,930 --> 00:44:52,248
What could they gain from being you?

335
00:44:52,312 --> 00:44:55,331
What does your wife gain by
denying you exist.

336
00:44:57,912 --> 00:44:58,902
Do you believe me?

337
00:44:59,789 --> 00:45:02,187
In the Stasi, we had a basic principle.

338
00:45:02,342 --> 00:45:06,035
Ask enough questions and the man who's
lying will eventually change his story.

339
00:45:06,977 --> 00:45:12,034
But the man who tells the truth cannot change
his, however unlikely his story sounds.

340
00:45:12,328 --> 00:45:17,498
- Do you believe me ?
- I believe you are telling the truth Dr. Harris.

341
00:45:18,001 --> 00:45:20,782
I'll start by calling your colleague
at Langmore.

342
00:45:20,933 --> 00:45:24,081
As you say, it's Thanksgiving.
There's the time difference.

343
00:45:24,286 --> 00:45:27,034
So it may take time to make contact.

344
00:45:27,376 --> 00:45:32,362
- Then there is the question of ..
- Oh .. money. Of course.

345
00:45:32,767 --> 00:45:35,649
Unfortunately yes. Money.

346
00:45:37,111 --> 00:45:40,690
Of course. Here. Here's
everything I have.

347
00:45:42,534 --> 00:45:44,571
I ll pay you in full as soon as I can.

348
00:45:48,714 --> 00:45:51,166
- For expenses.
- Sure.

349
00:45:51,959 --> 00:45:54,011
I'll need 24 hours. Call me
tomorrow afternoon.

350
00:45:54,334 --> 00:45:57,321
And go find your taxi driver.
She should talk to me.

351
00:45:58,723 --> 00:46:00,697
She was there at the beginning
of all this.

352
00:46:01,041 --> 00:46:03,304
- Perhaps she knows something.
- I've already tried.

353
00:46:03,926 --> 00:46:06,848
There may be details we've overlooked.

354
00:46:07,184 --> 00:46:10,994
That's what I was really known for.
Details.

355
00:46:17,291 --> 00:46:18,094
Gina.

356
00:46:25,884 --> 00:46:28,431
I know why you run away from the accident.

357
00:46:28,921 --> 00:46:29,985
You're an illegal.

358
00:46:30,887 --> 00:46:34,041
If the police have picked you up,
they would have deported you.

359
00:46:36,036 --> 00:46:37,480
I want you to have this.

360
00:46:38,345 --> 00:46:41,194
I don't want it.
It's worth at least 5000 Euro.

361
00:46:43,136 --> 00:46:45,725
Feel the weight of it.  Go on. It's
the real thing.

362
00:46:48,089 --> 00:46:49,757
E.H. to M.H. ?

363
00:46:50,009 --> 00:46:53,164
Elizabeth Harris. My wife.
To me, Martin.

364
00:46:53,228 --> 00:46:54,765
Special gift.

365
00:46:58,096 --> 00:47:02,663
- Ok Martin Harris. What do you want?
- There痴 someone I need you to speak to.

366
00:47:02,757 --> 00:47:05,499
- I知 not talking to the police.
- He's not the police. I promise you.

367
00:47:05,817 --> 00:47:08,196
I just need you to tell him what happened.

368
00:47:08,497 --> 00:47:10,933
Anything. Everything you can remember.

369
00:47:12,351 --> 00:47:14,643
And I need a place to crash tonight.

370
00:47:19,134 --> 00:47:20,832
Please.

371
00:47:27,766 --> 00:47:31,317
?? .  Whichever is the first
thing to go.

372
00:47:33,547 --> 00:47:35,369
Airport security.

373
00:47:37,791 --> 00:47:39,421
Herr Brandt, line one is for you.

374
00:47:42,035 --> 00:47:44,912
- Brandt.
- Hans ? It's Jurgen.

375
00:47:47,334 --> 00:47:49,252
- Jurgen ?
- From the good old days.

376
00:47:50,427 --> 00:47:53,208
Hans, you have to do me a favor.

377
00:47:53,285 --> 00:47:56,704
I picked you up from the Adlon Hotel.
You wanted to go to the airport.

378
00:47:57,496 --> 00:48:00,595
- You were in a hurry.
- That's it?

379
00:48:00,844 --> 00:48:03,909
I'd just arrived. That doesn't make sense.

380
00:48:05,467 --> 00:48:09,187
She didn't recognize you.
How long have you been married?

381
00:48:09,441 --> 00:48:10,818
- 5years.
- 5 years?

382
00:48:11,119 --> 00:48:13,005
I know it sounds crazy but it's true.

383
00:48:13,534 --> 00:48:16,285
This is it. Sorry no elevator.

384
00:48:17,623 --> 00:48:19,526
I know. Not the Adlon hotel.

385
00:48:30,782 --> 00:48:32,700
<i>(Loud arguing heard from other apartment.)</i>

386
00:48:32,725 --> 00:48:36,173
The walls are made from
cardboard. But it's home.

387
00:48:37,715 --> 00:48:38,825
I have to work tonight.

388
00:48:39,842 --> 00:48:41,963
You can sleep in there. I have extra mattress.

389
00:48:43,365 --> 00:48:44,563
It's quaint.

390
00:48:50,246 --> 00:48:52,259
<i>(indistinct conversation in German)</i>

391
00:49:44,962 --> 00:49:46,441
Would you mind if I took a shower?

392
00:49:47,955 --> 00:49:50,766
You can try. I'm not sure you will fit.

393
00:49:51,002 --> 00:49:52,183
The light is broken.

394
00:49:52,740 --> 00:49:55,283
You need to leave the door
open if you want to see anything.

395
00:50:11,001 --> 00:50:12,372
I知 sorry .. I just.

396
00:50:12,764 --> 00:50:14,860
I give you a place to stay but that
does not give you the right to ..

397
00:50:15,124 --> 00:50:16,188
You're right.

398
00:50:16,899 --> 00:50:18,682
They're good. Your drawings.

399
00:50:32,315 --> 00:50:33,419
You want to know?

400
00:50:38,893 --> 00:50:44,690
This is me.   3,258 Euros and counting.

401
00:50:46,007 --> 00:50:48,483
I get to 4,000 I can get papers.

402
00:50:48,885 --> 00:50:50,562
So I can get the hell out of here.

403
00:50:51,523 --> 00:50:55,544
- Sell the watch. You'll get more than you need.
- I plan to.

404
00:51:05,926 --> 00:51:10,242
<i>(sound of loud thumping and love
making from next apartment)</i>

405
00:51:15,481 --> 00:51:19,827
- How do you sleep ?
- Ah, he never goes for very long.

406
00:51:22,483 --> 00:51:26,755
- This guy Jurgen.
- He's absolutely no danger to you.

407
00:51:29,912 --> 00:51:31,352
Ok.

408
00:51:43,426 --> 00:51:44,359
Hello.

409
00:51:45,826 --> 00:51:47,846
- You've got company.
- Do you have the keys?

410
00:51:48,167 --> 00:51:53,401
Bring it back to my place.  Leave the keys
on the tv and don't forget to reset the meter.

411
00:51:53,484 --> 00:51:55,244
- You're the best.
- I know. Come.

412
00:51:59,469 --> 00:52:01,280
Yes,  I sleep with every
American you send my way.

413
00:52:01,599 --> 00:52:02,769
No need to explain. Heh heh heh.

414
00:52:21,543 --> 00:52:23,371
Biko ! You're going to be late.

415
00:53:49,010 --> 00:53:49,904
Jones ?

416
00:54:38,673 --> 00:54:40,676
Biko.

417
00:55:32,813 --> 00:55:34,138
Who are you ?

418
00:55:35,085 --> 00:55:36,274
Who the hell are you?

419
00:55:43,897 --> 00:55:47,805
Biko's keys. Give them to me.
C'mon, we can't stay here.

420
00:56:00,305 --> 00:56:01,513
This one.

421
00:56:15,679 --> 00:56:16,508
Are you all right?

422
00:56:18,603 --> 00:56:20,593
That guy killed a nurse in the hospital.

423
00:56:21,273 --> 00:56:22,675
- What?
- He killed a nurse.

424
00:56:58,175 --> 00:57:00,382
- Left. Go left.
- Hang on.

425
00:57:38,314 --> 00:57:40,568
- Where is he ?
- I can't see him.

426
00:57:51,597 --> 00:57:53,696
- Where's the wipers.
- To the left.

427
00:57:54,862 --> 00:57:55,639
Oh shit !

428
00:58:13,564 --> 00:58:14,816
Go.

429
00:58:52,887 --> 00:58:54,799
- Get off the tracks.
- I知 trying to.

430
00:59:08,377 --> 00:59:09,128
Jesus.

431
00:59:33,298 --> 00:59:34,811
C'mon. C'mon. Go.

432
00:59:54,431 --> 00:59:55,745
In here.

433
00:59:56,142 --> 00:59:57,652
Out of the way. Out of the way

434
00:59:58,827 --> 01:00:00,842
Slow down. Take it easy.

435
01:00:01,030 --> 01:00:02,126
- We're being followed.
- Vladimir.

436
01:00:02,150 --> 01:00:03,301
Hey, Gina ??

437
01:00:10,326 --> 01:00:12,916
We're full. Calm down.

438
01:01:08,487 --> 01:01:09,907
Gina.

439
01:01:11,402 --> 01:01:13,931
You have to know.

440
01:01:13,955 --> 01:01:15,873
I have never laid eyes on those men.

441
01:01:17,114 --> 01:01:19,563
Why the hell did you have to get into my taxi.

442
01:01:19,622 --> 01:01:21,456
I wish I hadn't. Believe me.

443
01:01:24,962 --> 01:01:28,289
And Biko. His family is in Africa.

444
01:01:28,919 --> 01:01:31,290
The money will just stop coming.
They willl never know why.

445
01:01:36,102 --> 01:01:40,237
Men like that. Back there. I have
seen those kind of men before.

446
01:01:41,497 --> 01:01:43,462
They killed my family in Bosnia.

447
01:01:43,991 --> 01:01:46,964
My mother, my father, my brother,
slaughtered.

448
01:01:47,444 --> 01:01:48,651
We have to disappear.

449
01:01:49,030 --> 01:01:50,621
Gina, they're after me. Not you.

450
01:01:50,709 --> 01:01:52,552
Don't be stupid. They're after both of us.

451
01:01:53,389 --> 01:01:55,882
If they killed Biko, they'll kill me
just as easily.

452
01:03:03,190 --> 01:03:04,388
<i>Are you ready?</i>

453
01:03:06,684 --> 01:03:07,686
Don't ask.

454
01:03:16,885 --> 01:03:17,788
Thank you.

455
01:03:20,479 --> 01:03:23,343
I知 sorry I brought more
trouble into your life.

456
01:03:25,706 --> 01:03:28,014
I will try and make up for it. I promise.

457
01:03:33,769 --> 01:03:35,322
I know.

458
01:03:37,021 --> 01:03:38,523
I figured something out.

459
01:03:42,659 --> 01:03:44,169
It's a simple code.

460
01:03:45,457 --> 01:03:49,511
The first number refers to a page in the
book. The second to a line on that page.

461
01:03:49,793 --> 01:03:51,293
The third to the words on that line.

462
01:03:51,701 --> 01:03:54,769
- What are the words ?
- The Latin names of 2 plant species.

463
01:03:54,793 --> 01:03:58,726
Calochortus Albus and
Umbellularia Californica.

464
01:03:58,750 --> 01:04:02,299
Ferry lantern and California bay. Both
common flowering plants.

465
01:04:02,323 --> 01:04:03,953
What does it mean ?

466
01:04:03,977 --> 01:04:06,087
That I don't know.

467
01:04:06,664 --> 01:04:09,187
Not part of your work, or
professor Bresslers.

468
01:04:09,469 --> 01:04:10,347
No.

469
01:04:10,832 --> 01:04:14,034
Tell me Martin. How close are
professor Bressler and prince Shada ?

470
01:04:14,295 --> 01:04:16,438
Very close. The prince is sponsoring
the summit.

471
01:04:16,730 --> 01:04:17,786
They're both progressives.

472
01:04:17,972 --> 01:04:20,033
Bressler wants to end world hunger.

473
01:04:20,057 --> 01:04:22,454
He's uh researching new forms of crop
cultivation.

474
01:04:22,479 --> 01:04:25,356
Offering open access to his data.

475
01:04:25,465 --> 01:04:26,995
The prince funds his work.

476
01:04:27,292 --> 01:04:28,551
He knows the world will need food ..

477
01:04:28,632 --> 01:04:32,475
.. long after his oil resources are depleted.
Those patents will be worth a fortune.

478
01:04:33,050 --> 01:04:35,479
But the prince's progressiveness
has cost him.

479
01:04:35,761 --> 01:04:38,097
Extremists in his own country hate him.

480
01:04:38,432 --> 01:04:40,123
And yet he perseveres his course.

481
01:04:40,147 --> 01:04:42,833
Despite multiple attempts on his life.

482
01:04:42,898 --> 01:04:46,677
There's a cocktail party before
Bressler's speech tonight, is that correct?

483
01:04:46,701 --> 01:04:48,235
Yes.

484
01:04:48,875 --> 01:04:51,939
For some there might be a very good
reason to want to be you.

485
01:04:52,548 --> 01:04:58,300
Martin Harris with just a few guests in
a confined space with prince Shada.

486
01:05:06,564 --> 01:05:09,363
Jurgen may be right, but we might
not be able to prove it.

487
01:05:09,797 --> 01:05:13,333
- I need to find Liz.
- Ah Martin, that is not a good idea.

488
01:05:13,605 --> 01:05:16,116
The people who have her have been
sticking to my schedule.

489
01:05:16,300 --> 01:05:20,001
- I know where she'll be today.
- Someone will be watching her.

490
01:05:20,799 --> 01:05:23,103
- What if he's there.
- He won't be.

491
01:05:23,143 --> 01:05:25,785
He's me remember. He'll be meeting
with Bressler.

492
01:06:08,672 --> 01:06:10,441
- Yeah?
- They've just sat down.

493
01:06:10,739 --> 01:06:13,098
Let me know when they leave. Thanks.

494
01:07:02,227 --> 01:07:04,721
<i>(please leave a message after the tone)</i>

495
01:08:23,554 --> 01:08:24,786
He's coming.

496
01:08:47,717 --> 01:08:50,959
- Liz.
- What are you doing here?

497
01:08:51,692 --> 01:08:53,711
- Liz, what's happening ?
- Are you crazy ?

498
01:08:53,745 --> 01:08:56,214
- You have to leave me alone.
- Why ? You have to tell me why.

499
01:08:56,638 --> 01:08:58,766
Are they making you do this ?
Are they threatening you ?

500
01:08:59,254 --> 01:09:00,856
How did you find me ?
Did you followed me ?

501
01:09:00,925 --> 01:09:02,404
When we arrived you saw the ad.

502
01:09:02,705 --> 01:09:04,461
You mentioned when we first
saw her show.

503
01:09:04,583 --> 01:09:06,728
In Chicago together. Don't you remember ?

504
01:09:25,219 --> 01:09:27,369
- I can't get out.
- Come with me right now.

505
01:09:27,384 --> 01:09:29,466
No. They'll kill us both.

506
01:09:30,268 --> 01:09:33,080
I never should have left you.  I never
should have gone into that taxi.

507
01:09:33,381 --> 01:09:34,770
You don't understand, do you ?

508
01:09:35,556 --> 01:09:39,123
Your briefcase. It got left behind
at the airport.

509
01:09:39,496 --> 01:09:42,387
That's why you were going back.
You need to find it.

510
01:09:43,616 --> 01:09:44,443
Wait for me there.

511
01:09:44,780 --> 01:09:46,234
Liz wait.

512
01:10:00,681 --> 01:10:02,442
I love you.

513
01:10:12,859 --> 01:10:14,252
- What did she say ?
- Not here.

514
01:10:27,618 --> 01:10:29,352
We have to go to the airport right away.

515
01:10:37,240 --> 01:10:58,437
<i>(Phone ringing in apartment)</i>

516
01:10:58,699 --> 01:11:00,617
- Is this Mr. Jurgen ?
- Yes it is.

517
01:11:01,218 --> 01:11:04,571
My name is Rodney Cole. I received
a phone message from you.

518
01:11:04,733 --> 01:11:08,131
And I received 2 from Martin as well.
What's the problem ?

519
01:11:08,764 --> 01:11:10,588
Oh dear.

520
01:11:10,693 --> 01:11:12,773
Well that痴 unbelievable. The poor man.

521
01:11:13,836 --> 01:11:16,670
Well listen. Here's the good news.
I've just arrived in Berlin.

522
01:11:16,769 --> 01:11:21,459
Yes I've been teaching in Leipzig .. at
the Hochschule fr Technik.

523
01:11:21,547 --> 01:11:23,742
Sorry. Please excuse my German.

524
01:11:23,766 --> 01:11:26,643
Well I came up for the last day to hear
Bressler's speach.

525
01:11:26,724 --> 01:11:28,095
I could come right over.

526
01:11:28,533 --> 01:11:30,295
No no no It's fine.

527
01:11:30,404 --> 01:11:33,797
It's no problem at all. I know exactly
where you are.

528
01:11:33,903 --> 01:11:37,750
I look forward to meeting you Mr. Cole.

529
01:11:37,854 --> 01:11:39,786
Well then I'll see you soon. Bye.

530
01:11:46,454 --> 01:11:52,638
Rodney Cole.  Leipzig.

531
01:12:10,692 --> 01:12:12,131
<i>(doorbell buzzes)</i>

532
01:12:16,500 --> 01:12:18,682
- Herr Jurgen.
- Dr. Cole.

533
01:12:20,539 --> 01:12:21,986
How do you do.

534
01:12:23,023 --> 01:12:23,969
Thank you.

535
01:12:31,623 --> 01:12:32,758
Drink?

536
01:12:33,060 --> 01:12:35,380
I have a bottle labeled brandy ..

537
01:12:35,404 --> 01:12:41,351
It is more than likely the vodka my
neighbor gave me to make her husband go blind.

538
01:12:41,454 --> 01:12:44,895
- No thank you.
- Maybe some coffee. I知 making some for myself.

539
01:12:44,983 --> 01:12:46,691
No I知 fine. Thank you.

540
01:13:06,937 --> 01:13:08,340
You were in the military ?

541
01:13:10,748 --> 01:13:12,992
In the Stasi in East Germany.

542
01:13:13,016 --> 01:13:16,085
Well my grandson is going to be very
excited to hear that.

543
01:13:16,108 --> 01:13:18,602
He loves all this cold war stuff.

544
01:13:20,728 --> 01:13:24,527
- What kind of car is that ?
- It's a Volga Gaz-24.

545
01:13:26,277 --> 01:13:29,539
Suspension of a donkey cart and
smelled like a ?.

546
01:13:29,946 --> 01:13:31,865
Vanished as quickly as the wall.

547
01:13:43,919 --> 01:13:46,494
This business with Martin
is a hell of a thing.

548
01:13:46,596 --> 01:13:47,739
How did he find you ?

549
01:13:47,837 --> 01:13:51,942
- Quite by chance.
- I would say he was damn lucky.

550
01:13:52,656 --> 01:13:53,994
How can I help?

551
01:13:54,454 --> 01:13:58,016
Come with us to the authorities.
Have them confirm his identity.

552
01:13:58,162 --> 01:14:00,379
The authorities. Oh, Jesus.

553
01:14:00,693 --> 01:14:02,023
Is it that bad.

554
01:14:02,157 --> 01:14:04,778
I mean the man comes to you with a story.

555
01:14:05,378 --> 01:14:09,844
- Why did you take this case.
- Well .. curiosity.

556
01:14:11,438 --> 01:14:12,464
Is that all ?

557
01:14:13,014 --> 01:14:15,197
There's not much in this world left ..

558
01:14:15,318 --> 01:14:17,440
.. to interest an old spy like me.

559
01:14:17,464 --> 01:14:21,492
A few questions I still think over.

560
01:14:21,612 --> 01:14:24,777
One in particular from when I worked for
the Aufklarung.

561
01:14:25,069 --> 01:14:27,585
Our foreign intelligence wing.

562
01:14:29,557 --> 01:14:34,004
They used to talk about the European
based assassination unit ..

563
01:14:34,135 --> 01:14:36,840
.. called section 15.

564
01:14:36,874 --> 01:14:41,064
Freelanced, reliable.  Did work for
whoever paid.

565
01:14:41,495 --> 01:14:43,459
Public sector. Private sector.

566
01:14:43,483 --> 01:14:46,552
Second to none in their planning and
efficiency.

567
01:14:46,834 --> 01:14:49,635
They never failed.

568
01:14:49,876 --> 01:14:55,020
And I知 told they're still in existence.
But it's only rumor, of course.

569
01:14:58,212 --> 01:15:00,211
You had time after I called you.

570
01:15:01,019 --> 01:15:02,532
Why didn't you run?

571
01:15:02,628 --> 01:15:06,061
Where should I run from section 15 Mr. Cole?

572
01:15:06,616 --> 01:15:08,051
I can hardly walk.

573
01:15:08,266 --> 01:15:14,500
<i>Before we could get Chesterfields, I
smoked 16 (brand of Soviet cigarette) a day.</i>

574
01:15:14,524 --> 01:15:17,594
Filthy Soviet things.

575
01:15:18,391 --> 01:15:20,788
Killed more Russians than Stalin.

576
01:15:21,194 --> 01:15:23,289
My doctors assure me ..

577
01:15:23,388 --> 01:15:25,190
I'll soon be joining the list of casualties.

578
01:15:25,290 --> 01:15:26,699
I want to know how he found you.

579
01:15:26,707 --> 01:15:29,968
I want every name, every source you
contacted on his behalf.

580
01:15:31,673 --> 01:15:32,969
And then what ?

581
01:15:34,597 --> 01:15:36,707
We shake hands and you go away?

582
01:15:36,731 --> 01:15:37,882
Hmm.

583
01:16:08,053 --> 01:16:09,493
Cyanide.

584
01:16:10,873 --> 01:16:14,580
You never think you have
the courage to use it.

585
01:16:16,146 --> 01:16:17,286
But you do.

586
01:16:19,108 --> 01:16:20,871
The best of us do.

587
01:16:29,912 --> 01:16:33,390
What if he remembers everything ?

588
01:16:33,966 --> 01:16:35,597
What then ?

589
01:16:50,390 --> 01:16:52,692
May I see some identification.

590
01:16:52,716 --> 01:16:56,552
He doesn't have any.  He was in an accident.
That's why the bag was unclaimed.

591
01:16:56,722 --> 01:17:00,176
- I'll take it.
- Wait. Wait. Please.  Bitte.

592
01:17:03,455 --> 01:17:08,529
The combination for the lock .. is ..

593
01:17:15,191 --> 01:17:16,595
"2/8/0"

594
01:17:20,247 --> 01:17:21,786
"2/8/0/6/3/5"

595
01:18:12,945 --> 01:18:16,068
- Who am I ?
- May I ?

596
01:18:34,652 --> 01:18:35,968
We shouldn't stay here.

597
01:18:36,567 --> 01:18:39,111
- It's not safe here.
- Liz told me to wait here.

598
01:18:42,943 --> 01:18:43,987
Where you going?

599
01:18:46,998 --> 01:18:50,002
You got your life back.
I知 happy for you.

600
01:18:50,092 --> 01:18:51,635
Now I need to get on with mine.

601
01:18:52,156 --> 01:18:53,646
Gina.

602
01:19:08,409 --> 01:19:09,721
Thank you.

603
01:19:10,978 --> 01:19:13,631
It's more than I need.
It's less than you deserve.

604
01:19:14,406 --> 01:19:17,203
For everything you've been through.

605
01:19:17,227 --> 01:19:18,857
Go on. Take it.

606
01:19:21,815 --> 01:19:25,824
- What if she told them where you are going?
- Liz ? She wouldn稚.

607
01:19:25,909 --> 01:19:27,874
- How do you know ?
- Gina.

608
01:19:28,455 --> 01:19:29,894
She's my wife.

609
01:19:32,435 --> 01:19:33,621
Yes she is.

610
01:19:38,047 --> 01:19:39,632
It's too heavy for me.

611
01:20:14,718 --> 01:20:17,283
Martin. Martin.

612
01:20:18,279 --> 01:20:20,614
Oh my god look at you. How you doin ?

613
01:20:20,692 --> 01:20:23,321
Rodney. What you're doing here?
Well you called me.

614
01:20:24,294 --> 01:20:26,916
Don't you remember. You
left a message on my machine.

615
01:20:27,004 --> 01:20:28,452
I got on the first plane I could.

616
01:20:28,535 --> 01:20:29,891
What have you gotten yourself into?

617
01:20:29,915 --> 01:20:31,833
I'm sorry to drag you into this.

618
01:20:31,856 --> 01:20:34,063
Ah, don't be.  We've been friends for
fifteen years.

619
01:20:35,007 --> 01:20:36,832
I know you'd do the same for me.

620
01:20:53,886 --> 01:20:55,177
Here let me take that for you.

621
01:20:58,845 --> 01:21:00,859
Fraulein.  Hallo.

622
01:21:00,883 --> 01:21:02,034
I don't have all day.

623
01:21:04,648 --> 01:21:06,758
Help me with my bags, please.

624
01:22:26,761 --> 01:22:28,872
I've never had this happen before.

625
01:22:28,897 --> 01:22:31,185
You really think you are
Martin Harris don't you ?

626
01:22:31,758 --> 01:22:33,226
What the hell Rod?

627
01:22:34,813 --> 01:22:36,879
You're my oldest friend.

628
01:22:37,088 --> 01:22:40,755
You know who I am.
It's me. It's not this other guy.

629
01:22:40,844 --> 01:22:43,533
- He's not ..
- Martin Harris. No of course he's not.

630
01:22:43,779 --> 01:22:45,630
But then, neither are you.

631
01:22:46,884 --> 01:22:47,726
What?

632
01:22:47,828 --> 01:22:49,520
There is no Martin Harris.

633
01:22:51,059 --> 01:22:52,907
He doesn't exist.

634
01:22:53,994 --> 01:22:55,071
You invented him.

635
01:22:55,953 --> 01:22:58,374
He's your legend.  You just made him up.

636
01:22:58,398 --> 01:23:00,316
As a cover to get into the conference.

637
01:23:03,209 --> 01:23:06,114
You're not making sense. Liz ..

638
01:23:06,467 --> 01:23:09,999
Liz. Liz is not your wife.

639
01:23:13,530 --> 01:23:15,206
You were a professional team.

640
01:23:15,329 --> 01:23:20,746
- No no no. This is insane.
- Your memories are not real.

641
01:23:21,283 --> 01:23:27,324
Martin Harris is a fabrication.  You just
invented a life.

642
01:23:27,348 --> 01:23:29,074
And then you filled in the gaps.

643
01:23:34,250 --> 01:23:36,197
She's right. You're really gone on this.

644
01:23:36,283 --> 01:23:38,951
She had to go in with a backup.
How do you  think she feels.

645
01:23:42,331 --> 01:23:44,729
They're gonna let her touch the ? someday.

646
01:23:45,125 --> 01:23:48,009
And thank you for retrieving the
briefcase from the airport.

647
01:23:48,097 --> 01:23:52,523
Leaving it there was ..  untidy.

648
01:23:52,547 --> 01:23:54,656
It was a loose end that didn't fit in
with our plans.

649
01:23:55,800 --> 01:23:57,353
You're gonna figure this out.

650
01:24:00,312 --> 01:24:02,529
By the way. He's dead.

651
01:24:03,948 --> 01:24:05,534
And he died very well.

652
01:24:07,380 --> 01:24:10,833
And I'm afraid that isn't something I'm
going to be able to say about you.

653
01:24:11,788 --> 01:24:13,010
I知 sorry.

654
01:24:14,092 --> 01:24:17,955
I知 really, really, sorry.

655
01:24:23,537 --> 01:24:24,429
Rodney.

656
01:24:26,842 --> 01:24:28,140
<i>What are you doing?</i>

657
01:24:42,071 --> 01:24:44,084
One year of preparation.

658
01:24:44,165 --> 01:24:46,805
We did everything we could
to make you come back.

659
01:24:46,916 --> 01:24:48,673
Do you know how much time you've wasted?

660
01:24:48,773 --> 01:24:50,276
It's Thanksgiving.

661
01:24:50,358 --> 01:24:52,086
I could have been home with my family.

662
01:24:52,100 --> 01:24:55,973
Having dinner instead of
cleaning up your mess ..

663
01:24:56,064 --> 01:24:57,783
.. because you bumped your head and
started to believe your cover.

664
01:24:57,965 --> 01:24:58,923
Tell me.

665
01:25:00,623 --> 01:25:01,944
Who am I?

666
01:25:04,510 --> 01:25:08,226
You were a trained assassin. And
you were my best boy.

667
01:25:10,451 --> 01:25:14,831
And now your just gonna be another
nameless dead junky.

668
01:26:06,433 --> 01:26:08,107
Gina. Stay down.

669
01:26:35,428 --> 01:26:37,761
Gina.

670
01:27:11,769 --> 01:27:14,148
No. No.

671
01:27:44,688 --> 01:27:46,062
Martin Harris.

672
01:27:46,096 --> 01:27:51,700
Married to Elizabeth Truman July 18th 2006.
Martha's Vineyard.

673
01:27:52,468 --> 01:27:55,821
Father died September 9, 1987 of
a heart attack.

674
01:27:55,939 --> 01:27:56,972
I made it up.

675
01:27:57,422 --> 01:27:59,972
I made it up to kill a man I've never met.

676
01:28:09,635 --> 01:28:12,653
Look,  August 27th. The entry stamp.

677
01:28:12,705 --> 01:28:14,688
You were in Berlin 3 months ago.

678
01:28:19,344 --> 01:28:21,617
- Are you ready.
- Almost.

679
01:28:34,952 --> 01:28:35,744
Ready.

680
01:28:39,391 --> 01:28:42,207
Who are these people ?
They didn't kill anyone.

681
01:28:42,699 --> 01:28:43,894
They ?

682
01:28:44,796 --> 01:28:46,814
We are killers.

683
01:28:48,562 --> 01:28:50,740
Prince Shada is gonna
be assassinated tonight.

684
01:28:50,924 --> 01:28:53,033
There's a bomb in his suite.
I put it there.

685
01:28:54,968 --> 01:28:56,839
You should have let me drown.

686
01:29:01,492 --> 01:29:04,150
What matters is what you do know Martin.

687
01:29:16,354 --> 01:29:31,124
<i>(reporters yelling out questions )</i>

688
01:29:36,039 --> 01:29:39,109
The conference guests are taking their
seats for dinner.

689
01:29:41,051 --> 01:29:44,119
Professor Bressler has entered the hotel lobby.

690
01:29:54,502 --> 01:29:57,379
The Professor is making his way to the
Eisenhower Suite for the reception.

691
01:29:58,991 --> 01:30:00,621
Switch to the 5th floor.

692
01:30:00,736 --> 01:30:02,751
Prince Shada has left his suite.

693
01:30:02,862 --> 01:30:04,971
He's on his way to the reception as well.

694
01:30:10,752 --> 01:30:12,851
I知 so honored you could attend this evening.

695
01:30:12,876 --> 01:30:14,704
The honor is all mine.

696
01:30:20,776 --> 01:30:22,311
Would you like a drink ?

697
01:30:23,007 --> 01:30:25,884
In some circles, my husband is more well
known for his Martinees than his research.

698
01:30:35,774 --> 01:30:38,434
- You have an invitation sir?
- I don't know if I'm supposed to  ..

699
01:30:38,538 --> 01:30:40,229
Leo, Lily.  Come in.

700
01:30:41,082 --> 01:30:43,464
I don't think you need invitation to
your own reception.

701
01:30:43,582 --> 01:30:44,469
Good to see you .

702
01:30:45,005 --> 01:30:46,351
So good to see you.

703
01:30:46,952 --> 01:30:49,075
- Have you met our host.
- Not yet.

704
01:30:49,527 --> 01:30:53,337
- Hello.
- Now I can see why someone would pretend to be him.

705
01:30:55,148 --> 01:30:56,274
This way.

706
01:31:03,683 --> 01:31:06,081
I need security at the service entrance.

707
01:31:06,541 --> 01:31:07,633
Here let me take that.

708
01:31:07,912 --> 01:31:09,657
I'd rather hold on to this if you don't mind.

709
01:31:09,740 --> 01:31:11,077
Oh you can trust me professor.

710
01:31:13,210 --> 01:31:14,745
Separation anxiety.

711
01:31:15,928 --> 01:31:18,510
- Just, leave it there.
- Of course.

712
01:31:18,536 --> 01:31:19,420
Thank you.

713
01:31:38,439 --> 01:31:39,322
Oh, excuse me.

714
01:31:50,518 --> 01:31:55,409
<i>Your slave device has found 1 hard drive.
Proceed to capture ?</i>

715
01:32:22,699 --> 01:32:24,521
<i>(indistinct chatter, laughing )</i>

716
01:32:32,204 --> 01:32:33,259
This way.

717
01:32:38,690 --> 01:32:39,922
Get your hands off her.

718
01:33:19,375 --> 01:33:21,140
There's a bomb in the Eisenhower suite.

719
01:33:21,243 --> 01:33:22,730
I put it there 3 months ago.

720
01:33:22,818 --> 01:33:25,373
I suppose now you are saying that
you are Dr. Martin Harris.

721
01:33:25,464 --> 01:33:27,545
You're not listening. Take me to the room.

722
01:33:27,621 --> 01:33:29,031
I'll show you exactly where it is.

723
01:33:29,040 --> 01:33:30,714
Up to the room in the middle of a party.

724
01:33:30,804 --> 01:33:33,771
With prince Shada and the worlds
leading scientific minds.

725
01:33:33,904 --> 01:33:36,087
Of course. Why didn't you say so before.

726
01:33:45,744 --> 01:33:46,813
I知 not lying.

727
01:33:47,029 --> 01:33:48,660
Pull up the reception recordings.

728
01:33:48,684 --> 01:33:49,835
From August 27th of this year.

729
01:33:49,915 --> 01:33:51,977
Do it now or many people will die.

730
01:34:01,946 --> 01:34:03,845
I知 just going to grab my bag.

731
01:34:11,939 --> 01:34:15,803
Here. Why don't you just wear it.
Like some nerdy accessory.

732
01:34:19,321 --> 01:34:20,501
Thank you.

733
01:34:29,252 --> 01:34:31,554
- That's got all your secrets in it, right ?
- Yeah.

734
01:34:33,352 --> 01:34:35,316
Will you excuse me I have to go to
the bathroom.

735
01:34:39,385 --> 01:34:44,443
Stop. Stop. That's it.  Do you see ? Look!

736
01:34:51,201 --> 01:34:52,543
Sound the alarm.

737
01:34:52,567 --> 01:34:54,199
Evacuate the entire hotel.

738
01:34:54,223 --> 01:34:56,140
We'll meet the prince at the service entrance.

739
01:34:56,164 --> 01:34:58,082
You two stay here and make sure they
don't leave the room.

740
01:34:58,106 --> 01:34:59,257
Is that clear ?

741
01:35:10,866 --> 01:35:12,006
Shit.

742
01:35:17,232 --> 01:35:18,513
Find the target and finish it.

743
01:35:18,647 --> 01:35:20,624
We got what we came for.
I知 going to take care of the bomb.

744
01:35:21,733 --> 01:35:22,856
Forget about it.

745
01:35:22,956 --> 01:35:24,845
They have my image on file from
when we planted it.

746
01:35:24,944 --> 01:35:25,638
So what?

747
01:35:25,672 --> 01:35:29,107
So I don't want my face connected forever
to an explosion we no longer need.

748
01:35:29,178 --> 01:35:30,271
Go !

749
01:35:39,800 --> 01:35:41,340
Lily and Laurel.

750
01:35:42,152 --> 01:35:44,701
Bressler's girls. Lily, Laurel.

751
01:35:44,923 --> 01:35:46,342
Flowering plants.

752
01:35:46,653 --> 01:35:49,243
Calochortus Albus and
Umbellularia Californica.

753
01:35:49,632 --> 01:35:51,970
- The code from the book.
- They're his passwords.

754
01:35:56,007 --> 01:35:58,557
Bressler is supposedly working on a new
strain of corn.

755
01:35:58,657 --> 01:36:00,422
One that can grow in any climate.

756
01:36:00,691 --> 01:36:01,872
It's revolutionary.

757
01:36:01,961 --> 01:36:03,669
If they access his research and kill him ..

758
01:36:03,787 --> 01:36:05,811
.. it could be worth billions in the
wrong hands.

759
01:36:09,564 --> 01:36:11,223
Laurel.

760
01:36:12,152 --> 01:36:13,157
Papa.

761
01:36:13,936 --> 01:36:14,952
Laurel.

762
01:36:15,175 --> 01:36:17,974
And if that bomb goes off it will look
as if Shada was killed by extremists.

763
01:36:18,061 --> 01:36:20,247
The Prince was never the target.
It's Bressler.

764
01:36:21,039 --> 01:36:21,803
Listen, listen.

765
01:36:21,908 --> 01:36:24,573
You have to tell Strauss. They're
after Bressler.

766
01:36:24,721 --> 01:36:26,345
Do you understand ?

767
01:36:29,722 --> 01:36:30,469
Go

768
01:36:32,218 --> 01:36:33,057
Out of the way.

769
01:36:33,726 --> 01:36:36,028
Move ! Move !

770
01:36:37,947 --> 01:36:39,923
- Laurel.
- Papa.

771
01:36:41,030 --> 01:36:43,519
Laurel.

772
01:36:59,419 --> 01:37:02,186
Oh Laurel. ??

773
01:37:02,293 --> 01:37:03,367
Papa.

774
01:37:05,841 --> 01:37:07,648
She was running around looking for you.

775
01:37:07,676 --> 01:37:09,016
- Thank you very much.
- You're welcome.

776
01:37:09,023 --> 01:37:10,459
- We have to leave.
- Yes.

777
01:37:54,312 --> 01:37:57,572
Christ, you really don't remember
anything, do you.

778
01:38:37,328 --> 01:38:38,327
Liz will be at the party ..

779
01:38:38,416 --> 01:38:41,231
.. where we'll access Bressler's
computer and steal his files.

780
01:38:41,334 --> 01:38:43,189
The client wants this clean.

781
01:38:43,341 --> 01:38:45,406
He wants the material from Bressler's
computer.

782
01:38:45,495 --> 01:38:46,603
And Bressler dead.

783
01:38:46,707 --> 01:38:48,343
No one can ever know what happened.

784
01:38:48,457 --> 01:38:49,265
When bomb goes off ..

785
01:38:49,354 --> 01:38:53,820
It'll appear that Shada was the target,
and that Bressler was collateral damage.

786
01:39:30,983 --> 01:39:32,973
I didn't forget everything.

787
01:39:33,992 --> 01:39:36,295
I remember how to kill you, asshole.

788
01:42:22,659 --> 01:42:26,212
<i>Less than 24 hours after the failed assassination
attempt on the Saudi prince ..</i>

789
01:42:26,743 --> 01:42:31,140
<i>Nobel laureate Professor Leo Bressler announced
the development of a new strain of corn.</i>

790
01:42:31,545 --> 01:42:32,698
<i>Fast growing.</i>

791
01:42:32,817 --> 01:42:36,247
<i>Self propogating. Drought tolerant and
pest resistant.</i>

792
01:42:36,094 --> 01:42:37,995
<i>To be made available worldwide.</i>

793
01:42:38,113 --> 01:42:40,406
<i>Without patent or copyright costs.</i>

794
01:42:40,506 --> 01:42:42,557
We have made the new genetic map of
this new sustenance ..

795
01:42:42,662 --> 01:42:44,492
.. available to all.

796
01:42:44,590 --> 01:42:49,159
It's a gift from Prince Shada
and from science to mankind.

797
01:42:49,652 --> 01:42:52,496
<i>Humanitarian organizations applauded
the announcement.</i>

798
01:42:52,641 --> 01:42:55,471
<i>But Agri-business companies
were taken by surprise.</i>

799
01:42:55,588 --> 01:42:58,615
<i>And watched as stocks plunged 14%.</i>

800
01:42:58,639 --> 01:43:01,132
<i>This is Annabelle Londain reporting
from Berlin.</i>

801
01:43:01,156 --> 01:43:05,280
<i>And in other news, the European Parliament
today ..</i>

802
01:43:19,858 --> 01:43:22,995
Hey. Now you're free to do whatever
you want.

803
01:43:26,071 --> 01:43:30,892
- Claudia Marie Taylor. I like it.
- It suits you.

804
01:43:31,748 --> 01:43:35,390
- Who are you ?
- Henry .. Henry Taylor.

805
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:39,828
- Ahh . Nice to meet you Mr. Taylor.
- Nice to meet you.

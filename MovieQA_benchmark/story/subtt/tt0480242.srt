2
00:01:12,031 --> 00:01:13,073
Ok.

3
00:01:22,499 --> 00:01:25,628
DEAR DAN, I'M A SINGLE MOTHER
OF A 5 YEARS OLD...

4
00:01:25,669 --> 00:01:26,962
DAN IN REAL LIFE

5
00:01:27,046 --> 00:01:28,797
MY DAUGHTER'S 18 YEARS OLD,
AND QUIT HIGH SCHOOL...

6
00:01:28,839 --> 00:01:31,634
WE'RE PARENTS OF TEENAGERS.
IN ONE WORD: HELP!

7
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:55,616
- Hey...
- Hey.

8
00:01:55,908 --> 00:01:57,076
Is this yours?

9
00:01:57,159 --> 00:01:59,119
- Dad!
- I didn't think so.

10
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:13,217
Hey.

11
00:02:14,677 --> 00:02:16,971
Hey, I was gonna do that
for you later.

12
00:02:17,054 --> 00:02:18,514
Now you won't have to.

13
00:02:20,432 --> 00:02:21,475
OK.

14
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:23,686
- Are you hungry?
- Yeah.

15
00:02:23,894 --> 00:02:24,937
- Cereals?
- Yeah.

16
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:26,146
All right.

17
00:02:26,397 --> 00:02:28,565
- So, the plan...
- "The plan"?

18
00:02:29,483 --> 00:02:31,402
Cara,
Dad's about to reveal "the plan".

19
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:32,820
I'll pack up the car...

20
00:02:32,903 --> 00:02:38,534
pick you up right after school,
then we'll drive straight through.

21
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:40,286
Sounds good.

22
00:02:41,203 --> 00:02:43,163
- Does not.
- What now?

23
00:02:43,289 --> 00:02:45,666
Well, isn't the whole point
that we go to school?

24
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:48,586
You're forcing us to miss school.

25
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:51,088
I mean,
what about my studies?

26
00:02:52,798 --> 00:02:54,049
Why are you smiling?

27
00:02:54,466 --> 00:02:57,428
I never thought I'd hear you say:
"What about my studies?"

28
00:02:57,511 --> 00:03:00,264
It makes me, like, smile.

29
00:03:02,057 --> 00:03:03,100
I don't wanna go.

30
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:04,643
We do this every year.

31
00:03:04,727 --> 00:03:06,729
Only time we can get
the family together.

32
00:03:06,812 --> 00:03:08,897
Gotta help Grandma
and Grandpa.

33
00:03:08,981 --> 00:03:10,941
- Go.
- You're destroying my education.

34
00:03:11,066 --> 00:03:12,151
Change.

35
00:03:15,321 --> 00:03:17,031
- Yes?
- Very good column, sir.

36
00:03:17,114 --> 00:03:18,907
That bit about curfews?
Very apt.

37
00:03:19,074 --> 00:03:22,911
Yesterday's column
on boundary setting was excellent.

38
00:03:22,995 --> 00:03:24,705
- Who are you?
- I'm Marty Barasco.

39
00:03:24,788 --> 00:03:28,000
I would like to thank you
for last Friday's column.

40
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:29,877
It helped me understand my parents.

41
00:03:30,711 --> 00:03:34,632
Ok.
Marty, what else can I do for you?

42
00:03:34,798 --> 00:03:37,176
I'd like to see
your daughter, sir. If I could.

43
00:03:38,427 --> 00:03:40,054
Jane!

44
00:03:40,179 --> 00:03:42,181
Actually, I'm here for Cara.

45
00:03:44,725 --> 00:03:46,936
Nice to meet you, Marty.
Come back in two years.

46
00:03:50,064 --> 00:03:52,983
Mr. Shaff says I'm one
of the best driver in his class...

47
00:03:53,067 --> 00:03:55,027
he says I'm highway ready.

48
00:03:55,152 --> 00:03:56,612
Mr. Shaff and I may not agree.

49
00:03:56,695 --> 00:03:57,821
Cara! Let's go.

50
00:03:57,905 --> 00:03:59,448
- So will you let me?
- We'll see.

51
00:03:59,531 --> 00:04:02,159
3pm sharp. Do not be...

52
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:04,161
- Late. We got it.
...late!

53
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:05,621
Yes, we do.

54
00:04:05,829 --> 00:04:09,291
That boy you were really rude to
before is my friend, Marty.

55
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:12,920
My lab partner and we're doing
an extra-credit project together.

56
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:14,213
Bus.

57
00:04:15,673 --> 00:04:17,591
- Wait, wait!
- Come on!

58
00:04:17,716 --> 00:04:19,009
Hurry up!

59
00:05:03,512 --> 00:05:04,555
Yeah?

60
00:05:05,472 --> 00:05:07,391
Yeah, Jordy,
I e-mailed it half an hour ago.

61
00:05:08,726 --> 00:05:09,852
What?

62
00:05:11,228 --> 00:05:12,896
No way. You're kidding.

63
00:05:23,741 --> 00:05:24,908
Where's your sister?

64
00:05:25,409 --> 00:05:26,535
You're late.

65
00:05:26,744 --> 00:05:29,580
She went to Yumms.
Can I drive?

66
00:05:29,747 --> 00:05:31,165
Dad's going to be syndicated.

67
00:05:31,248 --> 00:05:34,126
Not so fast, There're others
being considered.

68
00:05:34,251 --> 00:05:36,795
That's great. Can I drive?

69
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:46,221
Look, you're a fine driver.

70
00:05:46,722 --> 00:05:48,474
It's the just
the other hundred million...

71
00:05:48,557 --> 00:05:50,225
If you don't let me,
I'll never learn.

72
00:05:50,309 --> 00:05:53,228
But if I let you,
you may not live.

73
00:06:29,765 --> 00:06:31,350
What was that?
What are you doing?

74
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,728
- Could you be more embarrassing?
- Sorry to interrupt your studies.

75
00:06:34,812 --> 00:06:36,647
We can't all be monks like you.

76
00:06:37,147 --> 00:06:38,190
No!

77
00:06:39,066 --> 00:06:40,442
By the way, you're grounded.

78
00:06:40,609 --> 00:06:41,819
- I'm grounded?
- Yeah.

79
00:06:42,111 --> 00:06:44,238
- For how long?
- For life.

80
00:06:44,446 --> 00:06:45,614
Dad, come on.

81
00:06:45,948 --> 00:06:47,700
- It's humiliating.
- Tell me about it.

82
00:06:47,783 --> 00:06:49,868
- Grounded for a month.
- A month!

83
00:06:50,286 --> 00:06:53,747
But that's worse than forever...
Dad, why?

84
00:06:54,415 --> 00:06:57,543
- You lied to me.
- You can't handle the truth...

85
00:06:58,043 --> 00:06:59,545
Try me next time.

86
00:06:59,628 --> 00:07:00,713
- But, but...
- No, no.

87
00:07:02,214 --> 00:07:05,259
- Dad, I love Marty.
- Oh, please.

88
00:07:09,888 --> 00:07:13,642
Dad, dad!
Listen, I didn't know right away.

89
00:07:13,726 --> 00:07:15,352
- It took me a while.
- What's a while?

90
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:18,939
I've known him for three weeks,
but I knew in three days.

91
00:07:19,106 --> 00:07:21,775
Three days!
You can't know in three days.

92
00:07:21,859 --> 00:07:23,652
- Maybe she can.
- No!

93
00:07:23,736 --> 00:07:26,530
What you're feeling isn't love.
It's young...

94
00:07:26,614 --> 00:07:29,450
- Yes, it is. I love him.
- and reckless.

95
00:07:29,533 --> 00:07:32,411
- I love him, I love him.
- No, Cara, it is not love.

96
00:07:32,494 --> 00:07:34,705
- No, it is not.
- I love him.

97
00:08:06,862 --> 00:08:08,405
Dad? You ok?

98
00:08:09,281 --> 00:08:11,408
There goes
Jane's college education.

99
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:13,994
There goes Cara's.

100
00:08:14,286 --> 00:08:15,537
What about mine?

101
00:08:16,205 --> 00:08:17,289
No, you're good.

102
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:19,875
No, wait. There it goes

103
00:08:23,379 --> 00:08:25,130
You can't keep me from Marty.

104
00:08:27,633 --> 00:08:31,220
Dad, let me remind you
that guys are half the world...

105
00:08:31,804 --> 00:08:32,846
and I'll find others.

106
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:37,977
But know that only
Marty gets my heart.

107
00:08:38,102 --> 00:08:39,186
In the car.

108
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:43,774
I know a really good driver.

109
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:45,943
No.

110
00:08:54,368 --> 00:08:55,411
Here we go.

111
00:08:57,830 --> 00:08:59,915
I think your sisters
aren't very happy with me.

112
00:09:00,249 --> 00:09:01,292
Sure.

113
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:02,876
What do you think?

114
00:09:03,836 --> 00:09:07,590
You're a good father,
but sometimes a bad dad.

115
00:09:09,967 --> 00:09:12,636
- Who told you to say that?
- No one.

116
00:09:13,387 --> 00:09:15,306
Was it Jane or Cara?
You can tell me.

117
00:09:15,681 --> 00:09:17,683
- I made it up myself.
- No. You didn't.

118
00:09:17,766 --> 00:09:19,768
Which one of your sisters
told you to say that?

119
00:09:20,936 --> 00:09:21,979
I made it up myself.

120
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:24,857
I'm in the fourth grade.
I can make things up for myself.

121
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:26,775
- Jane or Cara?
- I made it up myself.

122
00:09:26,859 --> 00:09:29,111
- I can think things for myself.
- Jane or Cara?

123
00:09:29,236 --> 00:09:31,739
- I'm in the fourth grade.
- She's in the fourth grade!

124
00:10:18,827 --> 00:10:20,079
They're here!

125
00:10:20,162 --> 00:10:22,706
They're here!

126
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:24,208
Come, girls!

127
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:26,252
- Good to see you, girls.
- Hey, Poppy.

128
00:10:26,377 --> 00:10:27,920
- Hi!
- Hi!

129
00:10:29,588 --> 00:10:30,631
Hey, Dad.

130
00:10:33,884 --> 00:10:35,719
Now we're all here.

131
00:10:35,803 --> 00:10:37,471
- How are you doing?
- Fine.

132
00:10:37,554 --> 00:10:39,431
Or maybe not.
My kids can't stand me.

133
00:10:39,515 --> 00:10:42,184
It means
you're doing something right.

134
00:10:45,479 --> 00:10:48,107
You're so Hi, honey.

135
00:10:48,691 --> 00:10:51,110
Look at your girls,
they're all grown up.

136
00:10:51,193 --> 00:10:52,611
No, they're still very young.

137
00:10:53,237 --> 00:10:54,989
How are you?

138
00:10:55,072 --> 00:10:57,616
- How are you? She's getting bigger.
- Getting bigger every day.

139
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:58,784
Hi.

140
00:11:03,038 --> 00:11:04,790
- Hi.
- Hi, uncle Dan.

141
00:11:04,957 --> 00:11:07,835
Eileen, how are you?

142
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:10,379
- Did you hit traffic?
- Yeah, it wasn't too bad.

143
00:11:10,963 --> 00:11:13,007
- Hi, sis. Good to see you.
- Glad you're here.

144
00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:15,342
Who are they? I've never
seen these guys in my life.

145
00:11:15,676 --> 00:11:17,177
- Hi, uncle Dan.
- Say something.

146
00:11:17,928 --> 00:11:19,847
- Something.
- It happened. I knew it.

147
00:11:20,306 --> 00:11:23,225
- Way to go! It sounds good.
- Thanks.

148
00:11:26,729 --> 00:11:28,856
Honey, you're down here.

149
00:11:29,773 --> 00:11:32,318
Your brother, Mitch, has
a friend coming to visit, so...

150
00:11:32,401 --> 00:11:33,736
- I'm in the special room.
- Yeah.

151
00:11:33,819 --> 00:11:35,362
- Sorry, bro.
- That's ok.

152
00:11:43,037 --> 00:11:44,872
- You sleep tight.
- You too.

153
00:12:13,734 --> 00:12:15,235
- Are you tired?
- Get down, get down!

154
00:12:15,319 --> 00:12:16,528
Good morning.

155
00:12:16,737 --> 00:12:18,489
- Good morning.
- Did you sleep ok?

156
00:12:18,781 --> 00:12:20,658
- Yeah.
- Get down!

157
00:12:20,741 --> 00:12:22,284
Can I get you something?

158
00:12:22,618 --> 00:12:23,869
Get a life.

159
00:12:31,168 --> 00:12:33,379
- She just needs some space.
- That's not what she needs.

160
00:12:33,462 --> 00:12:37,591
Yeah, she does.
You all do.

161
00:12:38,968 --> 00:12:41,887
- Why don't you go get the papers?
- No, Mom.

162
00:12:41,971 --> 00:12:43,389
Yeah, go on.

163
00:12:43,639 --> 00:12:46,934
It would do you good.
Get lost for a little while.

164
00:12:47,309 --> 00:12:48,602
Maybe I should stick around.

165
00:12:48,686 --> 00:12:52,064
No. Get lost, Danny.
It's not a request.

166
00:13:54,418 --> 00:13:55,586
Hi.

167
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:16,982
- Good morning.
- I'll be with you in a minute.

168
00:14:18,525 --> 00:14:20,110
Then he went downtown.

169
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:23,197
Yeah, for coffee.

170
00:14:23,572 --> 00:14:25,574
Talks to him on weekends.

171
00:14:29,078 --> 00:14:31,205
Hi. Excuse me, could you help?

172
00:14:33,749 --> 00:14:34,792
Yes.

173
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:38,671
I'm looking for a book,
obviously.

174
00:14:38,754 --> 00:14:39,838
Anything in particular?

175
00:14:39,922 --> 00:14:43,634
Yeah, something that can help me...

176
00:14:46,679 --> 00:14:49,056
deal with what might be
an awkward situation.

177
00:14:49,139 --> 00:14:53,811
What kind of...

178
00:14:53,894 --> 00:14:56,313
Something funny might be nice.

179
00:14:56,397 --> 00:15:01,193
But not necessarily
laugh-out-loud funny.

180
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,821
And certainly not
make-fun-of-other-people funny...

181
00:15:03,904 --> 00:15:08,575
but rather something,
human funny.

182
00:15:08,826 --> 00:15:09,910
Ok.

183
00:15:11,245 --> 00:15:14,081
And, if it could...

184
00:15:14,456 --> 00:15:16,875
sneak up on you,
surprise you...

185
00:15:17,084 --> 00:15:20,671
and at the same time make
you think that what you thought...

186
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:23,549
was not only right
in a wrong kind of way...

187
00:15:23,632 --> 00:15:25,134
but when you're wrong...

188
00:15:25,384 --> 00:15:28,679
there's a certain rightness
to your wrongness.

189
00:15:30,306 --> 00:15:32,516
Maybe, what I mean is...

190
00:15:33,934 --> 00:15:38,105
more importantly,
I'm looking to be swept up.

191
00:15:40,107 --> 00:15:42,109
And at the same time, not.

192
00:15:42,401 --> 00:15:47,489
I wanna feel a deep connection...

193
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:49,783
to something.

194
00:15:50,409 --> 00:15:52,620
Maybe I don't know
what I'm looking for.

195
00:15:52,745 --> 00:15:55,789
You rarely
find it all in just one book.

196
00:15:56,624 --> 00:15:58,167
That's why there're so many.

197
00:15:59,126 --> 00:16:01,045
- So, what do we have?
- We have...

198
00:16:01,754 --> 00:16:05,215
- a sort of potpourri...
- Potpourri?

199
00:16:05,299 --> 00:16:06,717
of possibilities... Yes.

200
00:16:07,384 --> 00:16:11,639
We have poetry.
Dickinson, basic stuff.

201
00:16:11,722 --> 00:16:13,974
Little Neruda is always good.

202
00:16:14,058 --> 00:16:15,726
- I agree.
- Now!

203
00:16:15,809 --> 00:16:19,063
This is actually a real page-turner:
"The Life of Gandhi".

204
00:16:19,271 --> 00:16:24,693
Nobody has ever
been quite so cool as him.

205
00:16:25,402 --> 00:16:28,322
Lighthouses,
"A Good Man Is Hard to Find".

206
00:16:28,405 --> 00:16:30,157
The title alone.

207
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,409
Anna Karenina. I don't...

208
00:16:32,618 --> 00:16:34,620
Now, that's funny.

209
00:16:34,703 --> 00:16:36,664
No, actually, no, funny is here.

210
00:16:39,959 --> 00:16:42,586
Maybe it's not that funny.

211
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:44,880
No, actually that's funny.
Very funny, and true.

212
00:16:44,964 --> 00:16:46,966
Good. Ok, good.

213
00:16:48,259 --> 00:16:51,553
If you could pick only one.

214
00:16:53,389 --> 00:16:58,269
I would say
that nothing rivals...

215
00:16:58,602 --> 00:17:01,272
"The romance of Fishcliff'.

216
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:05,401
I'm being honest.
I just walked around...

217
00:17:05,567 --> 00:17:08,362
and I just grabbed stuff.

218
00:17:08,445 --> 00:17:10,698
- You were looking for?
- Sold.

219
00:17:10,948 --> 00:17:12,574
- I'm sorry?
- I want them all.

220
00:17:12,866 --> 00:17:16,328
- They were just suggestions...
- Make sure he gets commission.

221
00:17:16,537 --> 00:17:18,038
He doesn't work here.

222
00:17:18,455 --> 00:17:19,748
Well, he should.

223
00:17:23,252 --> 00:17:26,297
You're smooth.

224
00:17:26,672 --> 00:17:29,633
Actually, no, I'm not smooth.

225
00:17:29,967 --> 00:17:31,760
I'm Dan.

226
00:17:32,928 --> 00:17:34,179
Sorry.

227
00:17:35,723 --> 00:17:36,765
Marie.

228
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:39,393
Hey.

229
00:17:40,352 --> 00:17:41,437
Hi.

230
00:17:42,771 --> 00:17:45,899
Marie, can I make it up to you?

231
00:17:47,359 --> 00:17:49,194
Here is your tea.

232
00:17:49,486 --> 00:17:52,615
Hot, watch it.
And there is my orange juice.

233
00:17:53,073 --> 00:17:57,494
And I bought a muffin,
but I think they gave me...

234
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:59,663
a small planet.

235
00:18:01,165 --> 00:18:02,207
I'll leave it here.

236
00:18:02,708 --> 00:18:05,336
- Thank you.
- I have napkins and utensils.

237
00:18:05,961 --> 00:18:07,504
I'm a big believer in forks.

238
00:18:08,589 --> 00:18:10,090
And you are not, apparently.

239
00:18:11,133 --> 00:18:12,259
- So, Dan...
- Yes.

240
00:18:12,509 --> 00:18:13,552
You were born?

241
00:18:14,803 --> 00:18:17,514
I was born, like everybody else.

242
00:18:17,932 --> 00:18:19,558
And I grew up, like everybody else.

243
00:18:21,393 --> 00:18:22,978
Good?

244
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:27,066
Ok, what else?

245
00:18:27,191 --> 00:18:30,152
I went to school
and I had a Bonanza lunch pail.

246
00:18:30,778 --> 00:18:33,614
This show, '60s, a TV show.

247
00:18:34,114 --> 00:18:36,200
When I was ten,
I wanted to be a magician.

248
00:18:36,325 --> 00:18:39,703
So I used to hold these magic shows
for all the kids in the neighborhood.

249
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:43,707
I tried to make a neighborhood girl
levitate. But she didn't.

250
00:18:43,999 --> 00:18:48,087
And it involved a body cast,
and several stitches.

251
00:19:02,643 --> 00:19:05,729
Let me tell you something,
something I've never...

252
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:08,023
You're gonna laugh.

253
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:10,609
Something I've never told anybody...

254
00:19:11,735 --> 00:19:13,028
in my life.

255
00:19:13,654 --> 00:19:15,739
This is really hard
for me to say.

256
00:19:19,326 --> 00:19:25,583
And then she got, sick.

257
00:19:28,335 --> 00:19:29,503
And...

258
00:19:32,756 --> 00:19:34,049
It's taken a while.

259
00:19:37,094 --> 00:19:39,138
We should probably talk
about something else.

260
00:19:39,722 --> 00:19:43,851
Are you telling me that you're
a widower with three daughters...

261
00:19:44,059 --> 00:19:46,687
who preys on unsuspecting
women in bookstores?

262
00:19:47,021 --> 00:19:48,397
It seems that would be me.

263
00:19:48,939 --> 00:19:50,608
- Been there.
- Really?

264
00:19:55,154 --> 00:19:57,156
No, it seems that it's been...

265
00:19:59,742 --> 00:20:00,868
seriously hard.

266
00:20:01,452 --> 00:20:02,870
No.

267
00:20:03,871 --> 00:20:07,416
We're ok now.
We're really ok.

268
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,335
You don't have to smile.

269
00:20:13,005 --> 00:20:14,506
Better than the alternative.

270
00:20:18,010 --> 00:20:19,094
Can you hold?

271
00:20:22,306 --> 00:20:23,390
Excuse me.

272
00:20:23,474 --> 00:20:26,101
Hi.
No, I'm minutes away.

273
00:20:26,810 --> 00:20:27,853
Yes.

274
00:20:29,647 --> 00:20:30,689
I have to go.

275
00:20:30,814 --> 00:20:31,899
Ok.

276
00:20:34,777 --> 00:20:37,237
I just lost track of time.

277
00:20:37,738 --> 00:20:39,198
I wish we could keep talking.

278
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:44,036
It was nice,
and a bit unusual, meeting you.

279
00:20:44,370 --> 00:20:45,788
Maybe I can call you sometime?

280
00:20:46,330 --> 00:20:47,873
That might be awkward.

281
00:20:48,165 --> 00:20:50,918
- Cause you're in a relationship?
- Yes, a new one.

282
00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:53,420
I would've found out
if I hadn't been talking.

283
00:20:53,504 --> 00:20:56,382
- That's true.
- But it's not exactly fair, is it?

284
00:20:57,299 --> 00:20:58,342
Thank you.

285
00:20:58,509 --> 00:21:00,594
You know all about me
and I know nothing about you.

286
00:21:01,136 --> 00:21:03,889
I don't wanna go through
the rest of my life wondering...

287
00:21:03,973 --> 00:21:06,183
about the woman in the bookstore
who let me do the talking.

288
00:21:07,184 --> 00:21:11,146
All we'd be is two people
finishing a conversation.

289
00:21:13,732 --> 00:21:15,609
Ok. No harm in that.

290
00:21:22,074 --> 00:21:23,158
Ok.

291
00:21:25,744 --> 00:21:28,539
Call. Or don't, but, call.

292
00:21:35,379 --> 00:21:37,381
Hey, wait!

293
00:21:38,090 --> 00:21:41,719
I would even call
to say I'm not calling.

294
00:21:53,397 --> 00:21:54,440
Ok.

295
00:21:59,528 --> 00:22:02,364
"I'd even call to say
I'm not calling?"

296
00:22:06,243 --> 00:22:07,369
Sorry!

297
00:22:21,091 --> 00:22:24,428
I never do
this kind of thing, officer.

298
00:22:24,553 --> 00:22:27,306
I'm usually very careful.

299
00:22:27,890 --> 00:22:29,683
And nobody believes in...

300
00:22:30,893 --> 00:22:32,603
- Welcome to Rhode Island.
- Yeah.

301
00:22:32,686 --> 00:22:34,188
It's nice to be here.

302
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,861
- Hey.
- Hey.

303
00:22:42,279 --> 00:22:43,447
What's wrong?

304
00:22:43,948 --> 00:22:46,408
Nobody. I mean, nothing.

305
00:22:47,743 --> 00:22:48,911
Danny's back.

306
00:22:50,371 --> 00:22:51,455
I'm coming, Mom.

307
00:22:55,417 --> 00:22:58,504
- Are you all right?
- What? No, I'm good.

308
00:22:59,171 --> 00:23:00,297
- Really?
- Yeah.

309
00:23:01,173 --> 00:23:02,883
You don't seem good.

310
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:07,346
Well, it was the strangest thing...

311
00:23:09,223 --> 00:23:10,266
Wow!

312
00:23:10,849 --> 00:23:12,184
¿"Wow" what?

313
00:23:13,978 --> 00:23:17,231
I met somebody,
and she's really something.

314
00:23:17,815 --> 00:23:21,443
- Who is she?
- Bro, that is beyond huge!

315
00:23:21,652 --> 00:23:22,861
- You got her number?
- Yeah.

316
00:23:22,945 --> 00:23:24,613
- You gonna call?
- It's complicated.

317
00:23:24,697 --> 00:23:26,407
No, it's simple.
You've gotta call.

318
00:23:26,532 --> 00:23:29,368
No, he just met her.
He's probably worried it's too soon.

319
00:23:29,451 --> 00:23:31,412
No, it's never too soon.
Especially for somebody his age.

320
00:23:32,997 --> 00:23:34,039
Amy, Dan met someone.

321
00:23:34,623 --> 00:23:35,916
- He met someone?
- Dan met someone?

322
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,252
Come here,
how soon till he can call?

323
00:23:38,335 --> 00:23:40,713
I don't know.
I haven't been single for years.

324
00:23:40,796 --> 00:23:43,173
Me neither.
My God, who is she?

325
00:23:43,257 --> 00:23:45,467
- What's going on?
- Dan met a hottie.

326
00:23:45,968 --> 00:23:47,386
All right, that's enough.

327
00:23:48,429 --> 00:23:49,972
You know what?
Let's ask Annie.

328
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:51,724
- Just now?
- Now.

329
00:23:52,099 --> 00:23:53,684
How does she look like?

330
00:23:55,227 --> 00:23:56,895
- She...
- What's the...

331
00:24:00,149 --> 00:24:01,609
the question?

332
00:24:01,734 --> 00:24:04,695
This is my brother, Dan.
He needs your advice.

333
00:24:04,862 --> 00:24:09,366
He met some hottie downtown.
She's a little shell-shocked.

334
00:24:09,533 --> 00:24:10,576
Wouldn't you be?

335
00:24:10,701 --> 00:24:12,828
Mitch neglects to mention
that in their weekend away...

336
00:24:12,912 --> 00:24:14,872
she's gonna meet our entire family.

337
00:24:14,955 --> 00:24:16,123
I didn't want to scare her off.

338
00:24:16,206 --> 00:24:19,835
Let's go, everybody!
Let's go!

339
00:24:22,963 --> 00:24:24,757
So, Annie?

340
00:24:25,049 --> 00:24:29,511
Anne-Marie, Mitch calls me Annie,
but, I'm Marie everywhere else.

341
00:24:29,595 --> 00:24:32,973
I've two Marys in my exercise class
I didn't wanna confuse people.

342
00:24:33,057 --> 00:24:36,185
No, that would be not good.

343
00:24:36,810 --> 00:24:37,853
I prefer Marie.

344
00:24:38,103 --> 00:24:40,064
Come on, sweetie.
Women are on the porch.

345
00:24:40,147 --> 00:24:43,484
Girls out there, guys in here.
Come on, Dan. Let's do it!

346
00:24:47,571 --> 00:24:48,697
Perfect!

347
00:24:49,448 --> 00:24:51,909
The briefest time units.
Four letters.

348
00:24:53,744 --> 00:24:54,787
Nano!

349
00:24:54,828 --> 00:24:58,082
N-A-N-O.
Great!

350
00:24:58,249 --> 00:25:00,042
Hey, no spying.

351
00:25:03,254 --> 00:25:04,797
You guys are way behind!

352
00:25:05,089 --> 00:25:06,257
That's not helping.

353
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:08,550
I don't think "secretive" fits.

354
00:25:09,426 --> 00:25:12,429
No, it doesn't fit.
Let's move on to 12 across.

355
00:25:12,721 --> 00:25:16,809
For you to be interested in someone,
she must be really special, right?

356
00:25:17,059 --> 00:25:18,227
Skip 12 across.

357
00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:22,564
It is not going to happen.
She's already dating somebody.

358
00:25:23,023 --> 00:25:24,441
That's not your problem, bro.

359
00:25:24,817 --> 00:25:26,652
Actually, it kind of is.

360
00:25:26,735 --> 00:25:29,571
Listen up, 15 across,
five letters, pan-fry.

361
00:25:29,655 --> 00:25:32,157
- Listen up! Pan-fry!
- Grill!

362
00:25:32,366 --> 00:25:35,286
- Is there a rock on her left hand?
- No, not yet.

363
00:25:35,411 --> 00:25:36,537
Then all's fair.

364
00:25:36,829 --> 00:25:39,456
Focus, people! Pan-fry!

365
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:43,002
- Saute.
- Of course it's saute!

366
00:25:46,255 --> 00:25:49,425
The word before,
did we try "zeitgeist"?

367
00:25:49,675 --> 00:25:52,928
- It would be E-l-T...
- I think it would make "ozone" work.

368
00:25:54,138 --> 00:25:56,390
Lord, we hit the mother lode!

369
00:26:01,061 --> 00:26:03,564
Ten letters. "Anything that
can go wrong, will."

370
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:06,984
Earth to Dan.
We're still at across...

371
00:26:07,026 --> 00:26:10,112
- We're not even at down, Dan.
- We're dying here, buddy.

372
00:26:14,575 --> 00:26:16,535
- We're done.
- Hooray for the dishes.

373
00:26:16,619 --> 00:26:18,078
Congratulations.

374
00:26:18,245 --> 00:26:21,123
- We've beaten them up.
- It's been easy.

375
00:26:21,248 --> 00:26:23,751
- Let's check it!
- What now, boys?

376
00:26:23,959 --> 00:26:25,669
- Dishes!
- The worst is they laughing at us.

377
00:26:25,753 --> 00:26:28,088
Dan, what happened?
You were useless out there.

378
00:26:28,339 --> 00:26:30,883
- Sorry, guys.
- Lay off him.

379
00:26:31,008 --> 00:26:32,259
Saute.

380
00:26:32,676 --> 00:26:35,095
Dad, Mom, what do you think of?

381
00:26:35,387 --> 00:26:37,222
Mitch, it's too soon to tell.

382
00:26:37,973 --> 00:26:42,186
That being said,
she's bright, lovely, adorable...

383
00:26:42,603 --> 00:26:45,731
and if you botch this up,
we'll keep her and get rid of you.

384
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:49,693
Dan, honey, you missed a spot.

385
00:26:51,445 --> 00:26:55,074
Seriously. That girl is smoking.
Amazing. Really.

386
00:26:56,408 --> 00:26:57,493
What do you think of her?

387
00:26:58,452 --> 00:26:59,745
She's great.

388
00:27:25,396 --> 00:27:28,399
Run, run!

389
00:27:29,775 --> 00:27:31,777
Can I show you where
we are on this map?

390
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:33,404
Yes.

391
00:27:36,699 --> 00:27:40,494
If I had known, I'd have never
Not my brother's girlfriend.

392
00:27:40,578 --> 00:27:41,745
No, of course not.

393
00:27:41,829 --> 00:27:44,039
And, for the record,
I never called you a hottie.

394
00:27:45,332 --> 00:27:48,919
This is the bay,
and we're right there.

395
00:27:49,003 --> 00:27:50,129
I see.

396
00:27:50,212 --> 00:27:51,547
What should we do?

397
00:27:52,464 --> 00:27:54,883
It's kind of funny,
maybe we should tell everyone.

398
00:27:55,009 --> 00:27:57,011
No.

399
00:27:57,094 --> 00:27:59,388
We didn't do anything wrong.
It was sweet.

400
00:27:59,597 --> 00:28:01,515
Good! You guys are
getting to know each other.

401
00:28:01,599 --> 00:28:04,184
Yeah. Just showing her
where we're on the map.

402
00:28:04,393 --> 00:28:07,813
- Uncle Mitch, you're not counting.
- Ok.

403
00:28:09,523 --> 00:28:11,025
I know what's
going on here with you two.

404
00:28:14,236 --> 00:28:15,529
You're not hiding.

405
00:28:17,156 --> 00:28:19,158
Good ahead. ¡1!

406
00:28:20,534 --> 00:28:21,577
- ¡2!
- ¡Go!

407
00:28:23,370 --> 00:28:24,496
¡3!

408
00:28:25,414 --> 00:28:27,124
Clay, I know you're
in that back closet.

409
00:28:27,207 --> 00:28:28,584
Uncle, come on!

410
00:28:28,792 --> 00:28:30,002
- ¡4!
- Do over! Do over!

411
00:28:30,711 --> 00:28:33,088
- Do over!
- ¡5!

412
00:28:33,797 --> 00:28:35,299
¡6!
I'm counting to two hundred.

413
00:28:35,382 --> 00:28:36,592
- I see you.
- Yes, we do.

414
00:28:38,010 --> 00:28:39,303
I'm gonna lay down
for this whole thing.

415
00:28:39,845 --> 00:28:41,138
¡8!

416
00:28:42,806 --> 00:28:46,143
- Mitch is a great guy.
- He is! He's fun and funny.

417
00:28:46,769 --> 00:28:49,313
Uncomplicated in a good way.

418
00:28:49,813 --> 00:28:51,190
- Just what I need.
- He's a great guy.

419
00:28:51,273 --> 00:28:52,399
¡9!

420
00:28:52,733 --> 00:28:56,070
I just ended this long,
messy relationship...

421
00:28:56,403 --> 00:28:59,114
and I joined this gym
and Mitch was there.

422
00:28:59,448 --> 00:29:01,075
He's a great guy.

423
00:29:01,408 --> 00:29:02,660
You keep saying that.

424
00:29:02,743 --> 00:29:04,203
Well, because he is.

425
00:29:04,870 --> 00:29:05,913
¡10!

426
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:08,666
¡11, 12, 13, 14, 15!

427
00:29:08,749 --> 00:29:12,002
So good luck, to all of us.

428
00:29:12,086 --> 00:29:13,128
Ok.

429
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:20,386
So a little bird told me
you're gonna be syndicated.

430
00:29:20,719 --> 00:29:23,931
Lilly. They're looking at a bunch of
columnists. It's a long shot at best.

431
00:29:24,723 --> 00:29:26,058
She's amazing.

432
00:29:26,183 --> 00:29:28,644
Name a place,
she's either lived there or visited.

433
00:29:28,727 --> 00:29:32,398
Tibet, Chile, Berlin
when there was the Wall.

434
00:29:35,317 --> 00:29:36,360
Wait!

435
00:29:37,194 --> 00:29:40,239
- What did I miss?
- She'll tell you now.

436
00:29:42,783 --> 00:29:45,411
- And you? Have you found someone?
- Dad, don't...

437
00:29:45,494 --> 00:29:48,706
I know you always say that
with Suzanne you won the lottery...

438
00:29:48,789 --> 00:29:52,585
and that to try again
would feel greedy.

439
00:29:52,793 --> 00:29:55,462
But it's been four years.

440
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:57,590
Can we just walk, please?

441
00:30:08,309 --> 00:30:09,602
I wanted to spare you.

442
00:30:10,686 --> 00:30:12,646
And I never smelt a thing!

443
00:30:14,607 --> 00:30:16,066
Somebody please pass the corn.

444
00:30:17,026 --> 00:30:19,028
- And that's how we met.
- I got it.

445
00:30:19,111 --> 00:30:20,362
My version is different.

446
00:30:20,571 --> 00:30:22,948
- What's your sign?
- Scorpio, Libra rising.

447
00:30:23,032 --> 00:30:24,575
- My God, so am I.
- Really?

448
00:30:24,658 --> 00:30:26,785
- Do you have any siblings?
- No.

449
00:30:27,161 --> 00:30:28,287
Somebody wants some corn?

450
00:30:28,370 --> 00:30:31,332
Tell us something about yourself
few people know, not even Mitch.

451
00:30:34,335 --> 00:30:37,671
I am an accomplished...

452
00:30:38,505 --> 00:30:39,840
maker of pancakes.

453
00:30:40,049 --> 00:30:42,384
You should make some
for the talent show.

454
00:30:42,843 --> 00:30:44,011
What would your perfect day be?

455
00:30:44,595 --> 00:30:46,680
Mine would start with Annie,
and end with Annie.

456
00:30:46,764 --> 00:30:49,141
Mitch, we're not asking you.
So you were saying?

457
00:30:49,475 --> 00:30:52,269
My perfect day would start
with going to a country...

458
00:30:52,353 --> 00:30:54,271
where they speak a language
I don't know, new customs...

459
00:30:54,521 --> 00:30:58,400
someplace where I'm
completely out of my element.

460
00:30:58,817 --> 00:31:00,527
Welcome.
I think you've arrived.

461
00:31:02,238 --> 00:31:05,324
I want to say, the first time...

462
00:31:06,450 --> 00:31:08,744
Sweetheart,
you don't have to shout.

463
00:31:10,079 --> 00:31:15,501
I thought that I just died
cause there's an angel in the room.

464
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:17,753
Thank you.

465
00:31:19,171 --> 00:31:20,297
How sweet!

466
00:31:21,632 --> 00:31:22,841
- Very romantic.
- Yeah.

467
00:31:25,719 --> 00:31:27,137
Are you and Mitch in love?

468
00:31:27,221 --> 00:31:29,014
This corn is like an angel.

469
00:31:36,021 --> 00:31:38,440
- What shall we do tonight?
- Let's go to the beach.

470
00:31:38,607 --> 00:31:40,192
- Let's design a tent.
- Yeah.

471
00:31:40,276 --> 00:31:41,902
Big giant one!

472
00:31:41,986 --> 00:31:44,613
And we'll there tonight.
Ask granny if she's got one.

473
00:31:44,697 --> 00:31:46,448
Or we can chase each other.

474
00:31:46,574 --> 00:31:48,993
But we need the sacks.

475
00:32:03,215 --> 00:32:05,509
Dessert! Dessert.

476
00:32:05,593 --> 00:32:07,428
Danny, some of us are still eating.

477
00:32:08,137 --> 00:32:09,638
- It's getting late.
- No, it's not.

478
00:32:09,805 --> 00:32:12,558
I'm an only child too
and this is really overwhelming.

479
00:32:12,641 --> 00:32:13,976
Have you ever
lived your perfect day?

480
00:32:14,059 --> 00:32:17,104
When does a boyfriend
become a lover?

481
00:32:17,896 --> 00:32:22,943
All right. Stop asking her questions.
You've been grilling her all night.

482
00:32:23,068 --> 00:32:26,238
- Are we grilling you?
- No, not at all.

483
00:32:26,322 --> 00:32:27,740
She's just being nice.

484
00:32:27,823 --> 00:32:30,326
No. I love the questions.

485
00:32:30,409 --> 00:32:31,994
Please!

486
00:32:33,287 --> 00:32:37,082
On behalf of my family,
I would like to apologize.

487
00:32:37,791 --> 00:32:41,295
None of Mitch's girlfriends suffered
such an in-depth questioning.

488
00:32:41,378 --> 00:32:42,880
Dan does have a point.

489
00:32:43,047 --> 00:32:44,214
Right?

490
00:32:44,506 --> 00:32:48,010
Not the body double,
not the Knicks City Dancer.

491
00:32:48,093 --> 00:32:49,219
God!

492
00:32:49,303 --> 00:32:52,139
Or the "massage therapist."

493
00:32:53,098 --> 00:32:56,644
None of the flight attendants from
every major and regional airline...

494
00:32:56,727 --> 00:32:58,562
who've wheeled their carts
through this house.

495
00:32:58,646 --> 00:33:00,940
- That's enough.
- What? Am I wrong?

496
00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:02,274
Come on!

497
00:33:06,362 --> 00:33:07,655
Wow, Dan.

498
00:33:08,364 --> 00:33:09,949
Thank you
for pointing that out.

499
00:33:10,491 --> 00:33:12,076
You're the smartest guy I know.

500
00:33:14,411 --> 00:33:15,496
He's right.

501
00:33:15,704 --> 00:33:18,123
It's Annie's turn
to ask me whatever.

502
00:33:19,208 --> 00:33:20,584
She prefers Marie.

503
00:33:22,294 --> 00:33:23,921
Ask me whatever you want,
Marie.

504
00:33:24,672 --> 00:33:26,465
I don't have any questions.

505
00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:27,758
Come on!

506
00:33:29,802 --> 00:33:34,223
Mitch said early on that if I'd
forgive him his past, he'd forgive me mine.

507
00:33:36,475 --> 00:33:37,851
That's a stupid thing to do.

508
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:39,812
Ok, everybody into the family room.

509
00:33:39,895 --> 00:33:44,108
Kids, come on.
We'll tidy up later.

510
00:33:49,530 --> 00:33:51,782
John, bring the pies, please.

511
00:33:58,455 --> 00:34:01,041
Not you.
You'll be doing the dishes alone.

512
00:34:07,214 --> 00:34:08,632
- Six.
- Six letters.

513
00:34:08,716 --> 00:34:11,510
- "Closet".
- Yes!

514
00:34:12,011 --> 00:34:14,221
Good job! Your turn! Your turn!

515
00:34:18,559 --> 00:34:20,060
- Second word.
- Second word.

516
00:34:21,729 --> 00:34:23,564
- You! You!
- It has to be the actor.

517
00:34:25,232 --> 00:34:29,111
- I'm sorry, I was out of line.
- No, you're not, you're my brother.

518
00:34:29,194 --> 00:34:30,779
- You'll understand when I tell...
- Listen...

519
00:34:30,863 --> 00:34:33,073
nothing you can say would upset me.

520
00:34:33,157 --> 00:34:34,909
The woman at the bookstore.

521
00:34:36,452 --> 00:34:39,079
When you were talking
about my other girls...

522
00:34:39,747 --> 00:34:40,956
I realized something.

523
00:34:43,834 --> 00:34:47,463
What I feel for Marie is different.

524
00:34:49,548 --> 00:34:53,802
- That feeling in your...
- Heart.

525
00:34:53,928 --> 00:34:56,680
Yeah. When the heart is just...

526
00:34:56,805 --> 00:34:57,848
- Pounding.
- Pounding.

527
00:34:57,932 --> 00:35:01,018
- And...
- Like it's outside your ribs...

528
00:35:01,143 --> 00:35:02,186
Yes.

529
00:35:02,269 --> 00:35:04,396
- Exposed, vulnerable...
- Yes.

530
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:08,484
You feel heartsick, alive,
all at the same time.

531
00:35:08,776 --> 00:35:11,820
Yes, what do we call that?

532
00:35:13,989 --> 00:35:15,032
Love.

533
00:35:19,828 --> 00:35:21,121
You always did have the words.

534
00:35:21,997 --> 00:35:23,999
- Yes!
- Yes!

535
00:35:28,545 --> 00:35:31,215
- Stanford or Berkeley.
- Those are great schools.

536
00:35:31,298 --> 00:35:32,925
Maybe University of Washington.

537
00:35:34,551 --> 00:35:36,470
Or somewhere closer to home.

538
00:35:40,933 --> 00:35:43,519
Lil, you have trouble sleeping,
you know where to find me.

539
00:35:43,936 --> 00:35:45,104
Dad!

540
00:35:47,439 --> 00:35:50,192
Uncle Mitch, are you going in
for your good-night kiss?

541
00:35:50,317 --> 00:35:53,821
- You bet.
- Married couples don't sleep together.

542
00:35:53,946 --> 00:35:55,948
- Kinda high school.
- I agree with that rule.

543
00:35:56,198 --> 00:35:57,700
- Thank you, Dan.
- You're welcome.

544
00:35:57,783 --> 00:35:59,618
No.
Mitch, what're you doing?

545
00:35:59,702 --> 00:36:02,496
Marie brought some books,
but I thought she should read...

546
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:04,456
- a book by a real writer.
- No.

547
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:06,000
- Not a good idea.
- "Au contraire".

548
00:36:06,083 --> 00:36:07,668
- Please don't.
- Best book I've read.

549
00:36:07,835 --> 00:36:09,878
Maybe the only book
you've ever read.

550
00:36:09,962 --> 00:36:11,088
Don't argue.

551
00:36:11,171 --> 00:36:12,673
If you can sign it, that'd be great.

552
00:36:12,756 --> 00:36:14,300
That's first edition.

553
00:36:14,383 --> 00:36:16,468
- It's the only edition, Mom.
- So far.

554
00:36:16,719 --> 00:36:18,220
- Good night.
- Good night.

555
00:36:18,512 --> 00:36:20,139
Sleep tight.

556
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:24,143
I really wish you wouldn't.

557
00:36:25,811 --> 00:36:27,688
"Good luck"? That's it?

558
00:36:28,105 --> 00:36:29,398
We can work with that.

559
00:36:31,150 --> 00:36:32,192
Hi.

560
00:36:40,743 --> 00:36:41,911
Good night.

561
00:36:56,467 --> 00:36:58,052
- Good morning.
- Hey.

562
00:36:58,886 --> 00:37:00,888
- Say, "Good morning."
- Morning.

563
00:37:01,138 --> 00:37:02,973
Good!

564
00:37:04,642 --> 00:37:05,976
Have fun.

565
00:37:06,977 --> 00:37:08,896
Here you go, sweetheart.

566
00:37:09,772 --> 00:37:12,942
Marie. Will you join us,
please, beautiful girl?

567
00:37:13,525 --> 00:37:14,735
- Mom?
- Yeah, honey?

568
00:37:14,818 --> 00:37:16,487
- Will you hit that music?
- Sure.

569
00:37:16,779 --> 00:37:18,197
- John, hit it.
- You need this more than I do.

570
00:37:18,322 --> 00:37:20,115
Here he comes. I got him.

571
00:37:20,282 --> 00:37:22,618
All right, Dan. Get on over here.

572
00:37:22,910 --> 00:37:24,411
Here we go, boxer shuffle.

573
00:37:25,537 --> 00:37:27,122
I wanna see those fists up.

574
00:37:28,332 --> 00:37:29,833
3, 2,1, to the right!

575
00:37:31,085 --> 00:37:32,211
Get a good bounce.

576
00:37:32,419 --> 00:37:34,088
6, 7, switch!

577
00:37:34,630 --> 00:37:36,757
Counting! 5,6, 7...

578
00:37:38,884 --> 00:37:40,594
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

579
00:37:40,678 --> 00:37:44,223
Counting! 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

580
00:37:45,975 --> 00:37:47,017
You wanna take it, babe?

581
00:37:47,101 --> 00:37:48,269
- Do you want me to?
- Yeah.

582
00:37:48,352 --> 00:37:49,436
- Ok.
- Ok.

583
00:37:50,104 --> 00:37:51,146
Salsa?

584
00:37:51,146 --> 00:37:52,648
- Yeah.
- Salsa?

585
00:37:54,066 --> 00:37:55,526
The floor is yours, baby.

586
00:37:56,735 --> 00:37:58,320
And left, and one...

587
00:37:58,821 --> 00:38:01,949
Dan, hold on.
Dan gets to go up front.

588
00:38:02,032 --> 00:38:04,285
Beginners in the middle.
Keep your eyes on Marie.

589
00:38:04,368 --> 00:38:06,287
Let's do the arm a little bit.

590
00:38:06,996 --> 00:38:10,457
1, 2, 3, 4...

591
00:38:10,541 --> 00:38:14,003
5, 6, 7, 8.

592
00:38:15,546 --> 00:38:17,298
Now move your arms like this.

593
00:38:19,842 --> 00:38:21,427
1, 2...

594
00:38:21,885 --> 00:38:23,137
3, 4.

595
00:38:36,483 --> 00:38:39,904
Look, Marie, what to do.
Dan, what not to do.

596
00:38:40,446 --> 00:38:41,488
The other way.

597
00:38:41,488 --> 00:38:42,615
- You were excellent.
- Thank you so much.

598
00:38:42,698 --> 00:38:45,242
- Marie, thank you so much.
- You're welcome.

599
00:38:48,412 --> 00:38:52,041
You always hate to start it,
but then you feel so great later.

600
00:39:00,299 --> 00:39:01,717
That's a good stretch.

601
00:39:05,846 --> 00:39:07,932
Maybe you'll try that
on me a little bit later.

602
00:39:12,394 --> 00:39:13,479
It's good.

603
00:39:27,201 --> 00:39:28,244
Dad?

604
00:39:28,911 --> 00:39:31,205
Lilly, get your sisters
and meet me in front.

605
00:39:31,455 --> 00:39:32,498
Now!

606
00:39:38,128 --> 00:39:41,590
- Where are you going? Can we go too?
- Can we?

607
00:39:42,216 --> 00:39:46,845
My girls are looking for a little
quality alone time with their dad.

608
00:39:46,971 --> 00:39:49,098
But I promise we'll do it
another day, all right?

609
00:39:49,473 --> 00:39:51,475
Lil, come on.
Let's go. In the car.

610
00:39:52,518 --> 00:39:53,769
Girls, let's go.

611
00:39:54,812 --> 00:39:57,314
Dad, what is it?
Nana's gonna teach me how to knit.

612
00:39:57,982 --> 00:40:00,109
- Cara, let's go.
- ¡No!

613
00:40:04,196 --> 00:40:06,282
Ok, what are you waiting for?

614
00:40:06,699 --> 00:40:07,825
Come here!

615
00:40:09,326 --> 00:40:11,203
Right here. Right here!

616
00:40:11,287 --> 00:40:13,163
You're so heavy.

617
00:40:13,372 --> 00:40:15,291
I don't know,
what I'm gonna do with you.

618
00:40:15,583 --> 00:40:18,002
All right! I'm gonna fall down.

619
00:40:18,419 --> 00:40:20,045
I don't think I can do this.

620
00:40:33,142 --> 00:40:34,393
No.

621
00:40:36,186 --> 00:40:39,356
This used to be the place
with all the shells

622
00:40:40,024 --> 00:40:41,650
and the papier-mache shark.

623
00:40:42,067 --> 00:40:43,861
Remember you loved
the saltwater taffy?

624
00:40:43,944 --> 00:40:47,615
- When I was four.
- Yeah, but... Ok.

625
00:40:48,449 --> 00:40:50,826
Stick with me, guys.
I have an idea!

626
00:40:51,076 --> 00:40:52,119
Bowling!

627
00:40:52,202 --> 00:40:53,245
- Yeah!
- Bowling!

628
00:40:53,329 --> 00:40:54,747
Ok, sounds good.

629
00:40:55,748 --> 00:40:58,250
Life is full of disappointment.

630
00:40:58,334 --> 00:41:00,544
Big and sometimes even bigger.

631
00:41:01,211 --> 00:41:02,630
So, what's it gonna be?

632
00:41:02,796 --> 00:41:05,799
The lighthouse or
the whaling museum? Your pick.

633
00:41:09,261 --> 00:41:10,387
Do you know
why we have lighthouses?

634
00:41:10,804 --> 00:41:11,889
Because they're neat?

635
00:41:13,265 --> 00:41:15,434
That's right. Yes.

636
00:41:15,517 --> 00:41:19,146
And also because
they help when it's dark out.

637
00:41:19,313 --> 00:41:21,690
They help keep boats safe

638
00:41:21,982 --> 00:41:24,485
and keep us from crashing
into the rocks.

639
00:41:24,985 --> 00:41:27,238
Because when you're out there...

640
00:41:27,529 --> 00:41:31,700
and you're being tossed back
and forth by those big dark waves...

641
00:41:31,784 --> 00:41:36,330
and you think that
you'll never feel land again...

642
00:41:36,413 --> 00:41:39,416
and that you could just
split into a million pieces...

643
00:41:39,750 --> 00:41:43,379
and sink down all
the way down deep...

644
00:41:44,797 --> 00:41:48,217
it's the light
that keeps us on course.

645
00:41:49,385 --> 00:41:50,636
- The light...
- Dad?

646
00:41:51,262 --> 00:41:52,304
Are you Ok?

647
00:41:53,555 --> 00:41:56,684
'Course I'm Ok, honey.

648
00:42:04,650 --> 00:42:05,734
Did you guys have fun?

649
00:42:05,818 --> 00:42:06,860
- No.
- No.

650
00:42:09,613 --> 00:42:10,990
Jump inside, honey.

651
00:42:11,073 --> 00:42:12,575
- Kids!
- Where've you been?

652
00:42:12,658 --> 00:42:14,368
I know. I'm...

653
00:42:14,451 --> 00:42:15,869
We looked all over.

654
00:42:15,953 --> 00:42:19,039
- For an expert on parenting...
- I'm sorry. I wasn't thinking.

655
00:42:19,331 --> 00:42:21,458
Hi, buddy. Hi.

656
00:42:22,459 --> 00:42:23,544
I'm sorry.

657
00:42:27,089 --> 00:42:29,174
Yes, I got it!

658
00:42:31,802 --> 00:42:35,764
Dan. She was amazing.
You should've seen her.

659
00:42:36,265 --> 00:42:38,100
I've beaten you up?
I was fast, wasn't I?

660
00:42:38,183 --> 00:42:41,145
It was like I couldn't catch up.
Even your sweat is beautiful.

661
00:42:45,399 --> 00:42:46,442
Where'd Dan go?

662
00:42:46,984 --> 00:42:50,446
Mom, she moves
like a goddess out there.

663
00:42:50,529 --> 00:42:52,489
- Yeah?
- She's like a panther.

664
00:42:52,573 --> 00:42:55,159
- Just her body...
- Dry yourself off with the towel.

665
00:42:55,242 --> 00:42:57,578
She's competitive,
but I just wanted to pounce.

666
00:42:57,661 --> 00:42:59,788
Do you know what I mean?
I wanted to ride her up.

667
00:42:59,872 --> 00:43:01,123
- She was...
- Don't do that.

668
00:43:01,206 --> 00:43:02,875
She was like my stallion.

669
00:43:05,085 --> 00:43:09,423
She's so beautiful.
I wanted her to be in front of me.

670
00:43:10,341 --> 00:43:11,759
Marie!

671
00:43:11,842 --> 00:43:15,179
There're fresh towels up
there in the cabinet to the right.

672
00:43:16,805 --> 00:43:18,432
I miss your skin.

673
00:43:20,017 --> 00:43:21,769
I miss your smell.

674
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:26,357
I miss your eyes.

675
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:29,485
Dad!

676
00:43:31,153 --> 00:43:32,947
You're such a freak!

677
00:43:33,155 --> 00:43:35,908
No, sorry.
That was just my loser of a father!

678
00:43:36,075 --> 00:43:37,952
Yeah, he was totally spying.

679
00:43:45,167 --> 00:43:46,210
Hello.

680
00:43:46,418 --> 00:43:47,920
- Hello.
- We gotta talk.

681
00:43:50,214 --> 00:43:52,299
- Can it wait?
- Is this working for you?

682
00:43:52,841 --> 00:43:54,385
I mean, really working. Be honest.

683
00:43:54,802 --> 00:43:57,680
- I'm having a nice time.
- A nice time?

684
00:43:57,763 --> 00:43:59,848
- Yes, I am.
- Really? Are you enjoying yourself?

685
00:44:00,099 --> 00:44:02,184
- Except for the soap in my eyes.
- Ok.

686
00:44:02,268 --> 00:44:03,811
'Cause you know what? I'm not.

687
00:44:03,894 --> 00:44:08,232
I'm not enjoying myself, I think
that as two people of principle...

688
00:44:08,315 --> 00:44:11,235
- we should have ground rules.
- Yeah, sure.

689
00:44:11,318 --> 00:44:12,736
All right.

690
00:44:14,822 --> 00:44:17,616
That's what I'm talking about.

691
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:20,619
We need to keep our distance.
Stop. Stay away.

692
00:44:20,703 --> 00:44:23,163
- Towel.
- Stop. Ok. I'm sorry.

693
00:44:23,539 --> 00:44:24,582
Thank you.

694
00:44:24,999 --> 00:44:28,168
And, stop reading my book.
Ok, just stop.

695
00:44:28,294 --> 00:44:31,547
- Why?
- And that salsa thing you do...

696
00:44:32,172 --> 00:44:34,466
- What are you talking about?
- The salsa dance.

697
00:44:34,550 --> 00:44:37,678
This thing.
If you could just not do that.

698
00:44:39,054 --> 00:44:42,516
If you stop doing that,
it would be very helpful to me.

699
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:44,768
There're other things you can do,
such as not exist.

700
00:44:44,935 --> 00:44:47,605
- Thank you.
- I said it. I said it.

701
00:44:47,980 --> 00:44:50,149
I didn't mean it, but I said it.

702
00:44:50,524 --> 00:44:52,610
- And you know what else?
- What?

703
00:44:52,693 --> 00:44:56,488
I'm going to make myself
less attractive...

704
00:44:56,614 --> 00:44:58,991
so as to not encourage
any inappropriate feelings.

705
00:45:00,743 --> 00:45:05,289
Ok, that's hilarious.
I'm gonna stop thinking about you.

706
00:45:06,123 --> 00:45:07,541
- Good.
- I will.

707
00:45:08,542 --> 00:45:13,339
And if I start thinking about you,
which may happen in a moment of...

708
00:45:13,964 --> 00:45:15,424
- Weakness.
- Yes.

709
00:45:15,507 --> 00:45:18,552
I'll focus all of my thoughts
on your flaws.

710
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:20,304
- My flaws.
- Your flaws.

711
00:45:20,429 --> 00:45:22,765
- And they are?
- I have no idea...

712
00:45:23,015 --> 00:45:25,142
but you can rest assured
that I'm going to find.

713
00:45:25,476 --> 00:45:28,604
- I'm in here.
- Sorry, are you taking a shower?

714
00:45:28,938 --> 00:45:30,147
Yes, I'm taking a shower.

715
00:45:30,439 --> 00:45:31,649
A little advice.

716
00:45:31,857 --> 00:45:33,651
- Old houses, old pipes.
- Thank you.

717
00:45:33,734 --> 00:45:35,236
- Takes forever to heat up.
- Thanks.

718
00:45:37,112 --> 00:45:39,448
- Can I talk to you about something?
- Sure, absolutely.

719
00:45:39,657 --> 00:45:42,701
And can we just keep it between us?

720
00:45:43,410 --> 00:45:44,620
It's just...

721
00:45:48,916 --> 00:45:51,502
You were talking
about your life last night.

722
00:45:52,002 --> 00:45:55,631
The importance of travel and of,
trying new things.

723
00:45:56,423 --> 00:45:58,425
And I just started...

724
00:45:58,926 --> 00:46:00,135
Amazing!

725
00:46:01,053 --> 00:46:04,515
I'd love to do the same.
That looks like it's ready.

726
00:46:07,101 --> 00:46:08,143
Yeah.

727
00:46:10,271 --> 00:46:13,440
But, you're still dressed.

728
00:46:13,691 --> 00:46:15,526
I forgot.

729
00:46:16,402 --> 00:46:18,571
I'll look away.
I'll look over here.

730
00:46:18,737 --> 00:46:22,700
Anyway, so, I just realized...

731
00:46:25,327 --> 00:46:27,788
I've been thinking
a lot about what I wanna do.

732
00:46:28,163 --> 00:46:31,667
In the future,
Like not just for school, but...

733
00:46:32,251 --> 00:46:35,254
It's just hard to figure out
what I wanna do with my life.

734
00:46:35,421 --> 00:46:40,009
I know I wanna go somewhere new
and try new things.

735
00:46:40,968 --> 00:46:45,389
But it's just hard to figure out
the place where you should be.

736
00:46:45,681 --> 00:46:46,932
Right.

737
00:46:47,182 --> 00:46:53,022
And to have that experience,
which is what it's all about.

738
00:46:53,772 --> 00:46:55,065
- You know?
- Right.

739
00:46:55,274 --> 00:46:59,945
But it's also terrifying realizing...

740
00:47:00,571 --> 00:47:03,282
what you want is what you want.

741
00:47:03,365 --> 00:47:04,658
You know what I mean?

742
00:47:05,993 --> 00:47:11,498
It's interesting the way that...

743
00:47:11,707 --> 00:47:16,128
you end up somewhere
other than where you...

744
00:47:17,004 --> 00:47:20,758
We never know how come life
has taken you somewhere else.

745
00:47:20,883 --> 00:47:23,719
Somewhere you never imagined
and you can't do anything about it.

746
00:47:35,564 --> 00:47:36,690
Lunch!

747
00:47:40,945 --> 00:47:42,780
Mac and cheese. Nothing better.

748
00:47:43,072 --> 00:47:44,573
Adults are in the dining room.

749
00:47:46,158 --> 00:47:50,120
I think I'm going to mix it up
and sit with my peeps.

750
00:47:50,913 --> 00:47:53,457
- Dan!
- Please. Just let me be.

751
00:48:03,676 --> 00:48:05,094
- Hey, guys.
- Hi, uncle Dan.

752
00:48:05,177 --> 00:48:06,387
- Hey.
- Hi, Uncle Dan.

753
00:48:32,246 --> 00:48:33,581
Hello?

754
00:48:45,843 --> 00:48:46,885
Hi.

755
00:48:47,136 --> 00:48:48,679
- Hi.
- What's going on?

756
00:48:49,221 --> 00:48:52,558
Marie's helping me with something
and we're having no fun at all.

757
00:48:53,017 --> 00:48:56,061
I can see that, how is she doing?

758
00:48:56,478 --> 00:48:57,813
She's amazing.

759
00:48:58,397 --> 00:48:59,523
Bye, Dad.

760
00:49:00,024 --> 00:49:01,150
Bye.

761
00:49:01,650 --> 00:49:03,277
- Bye.
- Bye.

762
00:49:05,654 --> 00:49:07,656
- So you were saying...
- Oh, yeah.

763
00:49:08,115 --> 00:49:12,953
I was trying to make
like a really heart...

764
00:49:13,037 --> 00:49:16,582
but I didn't even know
how to draw a heart, so I cut it...

765
00:49:16,874 --> 00:49:22,713
and it came out, like a star.

766
00:49:24,798 --> 00:49:26,467
- Yeah?
- Dan?

767
00:49:26,759 --> 00:49:27,885
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

768
00:49:28,093 --> 00:49:30,137
Honey, you know
we're worried about you.

769
00:49:30,304 --> 00:49:31,472
You know that.

770
00:49:31,555 --> 00:49:35,100
And with your behavior
last night and this morning...

771
00:49:35,559 --> 00:49:37,603
we're now officially worried.

772
00:49:38,228 --> 00:49:39,855
Thanks, I'm touched.

773
00:49:40,522 --> 00:49:43,150
But I'm fine. You don't need...

774
00:49:43,359 --> 00:49:44,568
We're having
a private conversation.

775
00:49:44,652 --> 00:49:48,364
- Come on in. This is good.
- It's a private conversation.

776
00:49:48,447 --> 00:49:50,366
Mom, go ahead, I'm all ears.

777
00:49:51,659 --> 00:49:56,288
You do so much for your girls.

778
00:49:56,372 --> 00:49:58,207
And you do so much for all of us.

779
00:49:58,540 --> 00:50:00,292
But, what are you doing for yourself?

780
00:50:00,584 --> 00:50:01,669
- Not now.
- Sorry.

781
00:50:01,752 --> 00:50:03,295
Come on in.

782
00:50:03,379 --> 00:50:05,130
I want you to think about it.

783
00:50:05,214 --> 00:50:07,007
- It's fine.
- I'd like to speak with you.

784
00:50:07,091 --> 00:50:09,051
- Stay, go ahead, Mom.
- Nana?

785
00:50:09,134 --> 00:50:11,553
- Yes, honey?
- Is it cause he's acting weird?

786
00:50:11,637 --> 00:50:14,640
- Yes, that's right.
- There's an explanation for it.

787
00:50:14,723 --> 00:50:17,268
- Please tell us.
- I just wanted to talk to you.

788
00:50:17,559 --> 00:50:19,687
You got to be way backed up.

789
00:50:19,937 --> 00:50:24,108
I hope from time to time you're
treating yourself to self-love.

790
00:50:24,233 --> 00:50:26,986
- I talked to my urologist about this.
- Come on!

791
00:50:27,987 --> 00:50:30,114
That is not the real problem.

792
00:50:30,197 --> 00:50:33,284
The real question,
the one no one will ask, :

793
00:50:33,492 --> 00:50:35,411
"Is will Dan ever find love again?"

794
00:50:35,536 --> 00:50:36,912
- No, he won't.
- Howard!

795
00:50:37,037 --> 00:50:39,373
No, I'm sorry, he won't.

796
00:50:39,582 --> 00:50:43,210
If you're open to it,
love will find you.

797
00:50:43,752 --> 00:50:44,878
I suppose so.

798
00:50:44,962 --> 00:50:46,964
- Hey, people.
- Perfect.

799
00:50:49,133 --> 00:50:50,551
I don't think
I was being clear before...

800
00:50:50,634 --> 00:50:54,847
but you got to unclog that drain.

801
00:50:55,306 --> 00:50:57,057
- If I mixed a metaphor there.
- Yes, you did.

802
00:50:57,141 --> 00:51:00,185
So far what you've missed is:
"worried"...

803
00:51:00,269 --> 00:51:02,813
"love will find you"
and "unclog the drain".

804
00:51:03,981 --> 00:51:05,649
Thanks.

805
00:51:05,983 --> 00:51:08,068
- That's it. We're done.
- No.

806
00:51:08,319 --> 00:51:10,988
- No. That's not it.
- Come on, Ma.

807
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:15,242
We met Margot Draper's daughter
at the farmers' market.

808
00:51:15,409 --> 00:51:17,202
- Who?
- She asked all about you.

809
00:51:17,286 --> 00:51:20,539
Danny, you gotta have a little fun.

810
00:51:20,623 --> 00:51:24,835
Which means that Ruthie Draper
is gonna pick you up at 6:00 pm.

811
00:51:24,919 --> 00:51:26,795
- Mom!
- You're gonna have drinks!

812
00:51:27,922 --> 00:51:31,634
- You're gonna go on a date!
- No, I'm not.

813
00:51:32,009 --> 00:51:34,011
Yes, honey, it's time.

814
00:51:34,470 --> 00:51:37,473
- Ruthie "Pigface" Draper?
- Mitch!

815
00:51:38,474 --> 00:51:41,894
Not "Pigface" Draper.
I'm sorry, that is downright cruel.

816
00:51:41,977 --> 00:51:43,020
There's nothing cruel about it.

817
00:51:43,020 --> 00:51:47,233
I don't even remember
Ruthie "Pigfaced" Draper.

818
00:51:47,316 --> 00:51:48,567
I don't wanna go!

819
00:51:48,734 --> 00:51:51,695
I don't want to go
with the pig face.

820
00:51:51,820 --> 00:51:53,405
- He's going.
- No, I'm not.

821
00:51:53,739 --> 00:51:56,784
- It's been decided!
- I don't remember her.

822
00:51:56,867 --> 00:51:58,118
This is a blind date.

823
00:51:58,202 --> 00:52:00,287
We'll double. It'll be fun.

824
00:52:00,371 --> 00:52:03,916
- Right, Marie?
- Yes, it'll be fun.

825
00:52:07,878 --> 00:52:09,338
That's my girl.

826
00:52:11,340 --> 00:52:13,550
Come on, it'll be swine fine.

827
00:52:14,051 --> 00:52:15,719
I'm sorry.

828
00:52:15,803 --> 00:52:17,304
Go hog-wild.

829
00:52:37,366 --> 00:52:39,827
Ruthie "Pigfaced" Draper.

830
00:52:40,911 --> 00:52:42,705
Yes, all right.

831
00:52:47,626 --> 00:52:50,337
There's a girl coming over here...

832
00:52:51,380 --> 00:52:53,632
she's on her way right now...

833
00:52:56,594 --> 00:53:00,431
she's driving here to meet Danny.

834
00:53:01,974 --> 00:53:03,058
What's her name?

835
00:53:03,142 --> 00:53:08,063
Ruthie "Pigfaced" Draper.

836
00:53:11,108 --> 00:53:14,153
Ruthie,
She's living in a house of bricks.

837
00:53:14,820 --> 00:53:16,655
Not straws or sticks.

838
00:53:19,992 --> 00:53:21,869
I'll be your big bad wolf...

839
00:53:24,788 --> 00:53:26,874
I like your cute curly tail.

840
00:53:29,501 --> 00:53:31,253
All right.

841
00:53:32,421 --> 00:53:33,464
Here we go!

842
00:53:33,839 --> 00:53:37,509
- This little piggy went to the market.
- Yeah!

843
00:53:37,593 --> 00:53:40,304
- This little piggy stayed home.
- This little piggy stayed home.

844
00:53:41,347 --> 00:53:44,350
- This little piggy had roast beef.
- This little piggy had roast beef.

845
00:53:44,975 --> 00:53:47,645
- This little piggy had none.
- This little piggy had none.

846
00:53:48,854 --> 00:53:52,149
This little piggy went: "Wee".

847
00:53:55,694 --> 00:53:57,321
All the way home.
Sing it!

848
00:53:58,530 --> 00:53:59,615
Very good.

849
00:54:02,534 --> 00:54:04,870
I remember now.
It's such a beautiful house.

850
00:54:04,954 --> 00:54:08,916
- Hi.
- Everybody, this is Ruthie Draper.

851
00:54:08,999 --> 00:54:10,751
- Hi, everybody.
- You know everybody.

852
00:54:10,918 --> 00:54:12,711
They're bigger.

853
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:15,506
- Nice to see you again, Ruthie.
- Hi, Dan.

854
00:54:15,631 --> 00:54:16,757
Hi.

855
00:54:17,091 --> 00:54:20,094
I'd know you anywhere.
You look just the same.

856
00:54:21,595 --> 00:54:22,972
Ruthie...

857
00:54:23,180 --> 00:54:25,391
you look great.

858
00:54:28,269 --> 00:54:29,478
Funny!

859
00:54:31,564 --> 00:54:35,234
So, Harvard Medical. You're doing
well for yourself, Ruthie.

860
00:54:35,317 --> 00:54:36,902
- Yeah.
- Yeah, that's impressive.

861
00:54:37,611 --> 00:54:40,823
You mustn't leave
enough time though for dating?

862
00:54:41,282 --> 00:54:42,700
There was someone.

863
00:54:43,450 --> 00:54:46,912
He was very special in my life, but...

864
00:54:49,248 --> 00:54:52,668
He was lost
in a freak accident.

865
00:54:52,835 --> 00:54:54,295
I'm so sorry.

866
00:54:56,547 --> 00:54:57,715
Thank you.

867
00:54:58,924 --> 00:55:02,553
What's weird is that we'd only
known each other three days...

868
00:55:02,886 --> 00:55:06,974
but it's you know
how sometimes you just know.

869
00:55:07,057 --> 00:55:08,225
- Yes.
- Yes.

870
00:55:08,851 --> 00:55:10,185
It happened the same to us.

871
00:55:10,269 --> 00:55:11,687
Yeah.

872
00:55:11,770 --> 00:55:13,439
- So you're a doctor?
- Yes.

873
00:55:13,522 --> 00:55:15,774
What's your specialty?

874
00:55:17,484 --> 00:55:20,279
- I'm a plastic surgeon.
- Of course you're.

875
00:55:20,362 --> 00:55:23,866
No, I know what you're thinking.

876
00:55:24,033 --> 00:55:28,579
But I work exclusively
with burn victims and children.

877
00:55:29,371 --> 00:55:30,998
She's basically a saint.

878
00:55:31,540 --> 00:55:36,003
I'm just doing
my little bit to help.

879
00:55:36,337 --> 00:55:38,756
Just like your brother.

880
00:55:38,881 --> 00:55:40,382
Stop, I'm...

881
00:55:40,466 --> 00:55:42,551
When I can't sleep at night...

882
00:55:42,635 --> 00:55:45,512
I go online
and I read your past columns.

883
00:55:45,596 --> 00:55:48,974
- Have you read Dan?
- Only his fiction.

884
00:55:49,975 --> 00:55:53,270
You're in for such a treat, really.

885
00:55:53,354 --> 00:55:57,733
what you said,
the mother of Couch Potato:

886
00:55:57,942 --> 00:55:59,026
"Hide the remote".

887
00:55:59,109 --> 00:56:03,530
To make him get up and exercise.
It's brilliant.

888
00:56:03,656 --> 00:56:07,117
And the parents
of the five picky eaters?

889
00:56:07,201 --> 00:56:09,870
- Individual meals for each kid.
- Yes.

890
00:56:10,621 --> 00:56:12,289
"What are you, a restaurant?"

891
00:56:12,498 --> 00:56:13,749
- Right.
- Brilliant.

892
00:56:13,832 --> 00:56:15,793
- She used your every word.
- All I'm saying,

893
00:56:16,043 --> 00:56:19,046
is that I don't have kids.

894
00:56:19,213 --> 00:56:21,715
And I don't have problems...

895
00:56:21,799 --> 00:56:25,469
but it's clear that
if I do one day...

896
00:56:25,552 --> 00:56:27,721
your words will bring me comfort.

897
00:56:38,357 --> 00:56:39,608
I'm sorry.

898
00:56:39,775 --> 00:56:42,570
I'm gonna have to excuse myself.
I can't help it.

899
00:56:55,916 --> 00:56:58,711
I'm sorry.
But a girl that moves like that...

900
00:56:59,587 --> 00:57:00,921
a guy has got to wonder.

901
00:57:01,005 --> 00:57:02,047
Hey, man.

902
00:57:02,131 --> 00:57:05,301
- No, Marie is cool, right?
- Yeah, of course.

903
00:57:05,926 --> 00:57:07,011
I'm cool.

904
00:57:07,636 --> 00:57:09,555
But I don't think
Dan is interested in her.

905
00:57:10,139 --> 00:57:11,974
- He's not?
- I'm not?

906
00:57:13,475 --> 00:57:16,353
I don't think you are, are you?

907
00:57:30,075 --> 00:57:31,619
Nice! All right!

908
00:57:33,287 --> 00:57:35,331
I don't know what it was, but
something was holding him back.

909
00:57:36,540 --> 00:57:38,000
Not anymore.

910
00:57:38,751 --> 00:57:40,210
That's beautiful.

911
00:57:57,686 --> 00:57:58,896
Great!

912
00:58:02,650 --> 00:58:03,859
Come on!

913
00:58:05,194 --> 00:58:06,278
All right, we're coming!

914
00:58:54,076 --> 00:58:57,580
All right.
Home again, home again.

915
00:58:58,163 --> 00:59:00,374
- I really love your car.
- Thank you.

916
00:59:00,749 --> 00:59:01,917
- Bye.
- Bye.

917
00:59:02,167 --> 00:59:05,421
- Nice meeting you, Ruth.
- You too.

918
00:59:05,504 --> 00:59:07,131
- Come on, guys.
- Actually...

919
00:59:07,214 --> 00:59:09,008
Dan and I are
gonna go for a little drive.

920
00:59:10,384 --> 00:59:11,510
Don't wait up.

921
00:59:27,902 --> 00:59:29,612
- This is fantastic!
- Yeah!

922
00:59:29,904 --> 00:59:31,822
I know
what the secret ingredient is...

923
00:59:32,072 --> 00:59:33,115
love.

924
00:59:34,408 --> 00:59:35,993
Better and better with every bite.

925
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:38,787
- Words cannot describe.
- Thank you.

926
00:59:38,871 --> 00:59:41,540
- How are they?
- They're scrumptious.

927
00:59:42,082 --> 00:59:43,792
Truly mouthwatering.

928
00:59:44,460 --> 00:59:45,502
Almost on my third stack.

929
00:59:45,586 --> 00:59:47,880
- More, please.
- And nothing's stopping you.

930
00:59:47,963 --> 00:59:49,006
No.

931
00:59:49,798 --> 00:59:52,301
It's a secret recipe,
but she let me crack the eggs.

932
00:59:52,384 --> 00:59:53,427
Yeah?

933
00:59:54,219 --> 00:59:56,513
How's Captain Lucky
doing this morning?

934
00:59:57,014 --> 00:59:58,557
- It was fun.
- Yeah?

935
00:59:59,183 --> 01:00:01,852
Heard you worked up
quite the appetite last night.

936
01:00:03,604 --> 01:00:04,688
Could I have one more there?

937
01:00:05,439 --> 01:00:08,067
Actually, I am a little hungry.

938
01:00:08,484 --> 01:00:10,527
- Secret recipe.
- These are good.

939
01:00:12,029 --> 01:00:13,072
- Thank you.
- I love them.

940
01:00:15,699 --> 01:00:17,076
So did you uncork?

941
01:00:19,745 --> 01:00:22,623
Whatever happen, no one deserves
someone more than you.

942
01:00:23,582 --> 01:00:24,625
There you go.

943
01:00:24,667 --> 01:00:26,210
A football match,
you should play, poppy.

944
01:00:26,293 --> 01:00:28,545
Head or tail, outside.

945
01:00:32,549 --> 01:00:33,634
I used to feel sorry for them.

946
01:00:33,717 --> 01:00:37,221
- Yummy.
- Whoever loses washes the dishes.

947
01:00:47,815 --> 01:00:49,775
- Come on!
- Go girls, go!

948
01:00:59,743 --> 01:01:01,579
That's a foul, right?

949
01:01:01,745 --> 01:01:04,915
You're gonna do that?
That what you're gonna do?

950
01:01:05,207 --> 01:01:08,711
Yeah, so you wanna
take out my knees?

951
01:01:41,827 --> 01:01:42,870
¡Go, Marie!

952
01:02:04,099 --> 01:02:07,269
Why do you persist in acting
like a 15- year-old is beyond me?

953
01:02:07,353 --> 01:02:11,398
- I'm filled with reckless desire.
- You should restraint yourself.

954
01:02:11,482 --> 01:02:14,193
- What does that mean?
- I think you know what that means.

955
01:02:19,406 --> 01:02:21,158
- Dad, could you?
- Yeah.

956
01:02:21,242 --> 01:02:22,284
Thanks.

957
01:02:23,786 --> 01:02:24,828
Hello?

958
01:02:25,788 --> 01:02:26,914
No, I'm his dad.

959
01:02:28,582 --> 01:02:30,000
Someone named Jordy for you.

960
01:02:33,712 --> 01:02:36,507
Everybody! Everybody!

961
01:02:36,757 --> 01:02:38,717
Dan just got a phone call.

962
01:02:38,842 --> 01:02:42,137
Syndication is everything
for a columnist.

963
01:02:42,221 --> 01:02:43,597
All right. Let me explain.

964
01:02:45,724 --> 01:02:47,601
I've been asked to meet...

965
01:02:47,685 --> 01:02:52,231
with the head mucky-mucks
of the Lamson Newspaper Group.

966
01:02:52,648 --> 01:02:57,987
They're driving down tomorrow
and they'll sit down with me.

967
01:03:00,072 --> 01:03:02,283
That's great!

968
01:03:02,366 --> 01:03:03,742
Maybe you should get the job first.

969
01:03:03,826 --> 01:03:05,452
Yeah, right. Sure!

970
01:03:07,329 --> 01:03:08,622
Dan the man.

971
01:03:09,123 --> 01:03:11,250
Marie, come to me!

972
01:03:21,802 --> 01:03:22,845
Dad...

973
01:03:23,554 --> 01:03:24,597
Dad...

974
01:03:25,097 --> 01:03:27,850
Lilly just asked me
why you were flirting with Marie.

975
01:03:30,144 --> 01:03:31,228
I wasn't flirting.

976
01:03:31,395 --> 01:03:34,815
Don't worry, I covered for you.
I told her it was nothing.

977
01:03:35,482 --> 01:03:36,817
Because it was.

978
01:03:37,067 --> 01:03:42,114
Dad, I'm 17.
You were so flirting.

979
01:03:43,949 --> 01:03:47,745
It doesn't matter anyway.
she's not interested in you.

980
01:03:48,329 --> 01:03:50,414
But cool it, ok?

981
01:03:56,921 --> 01:03:59,506
- And congratulations.
- Thanks.

982
01:04:43,175 --> 01:04:46,178
He took a bus here.
He has relatives in Boston.

983
01:04:46,262 --> 01:04:47,388
Dad!

984
01:04:48,138 --> 01:04:49,890
Dad, he loves me!

985
01:04:51,934 --> 01:04:52,977
Ok.

986
01:04:53,561 --> 01:04:54,895
You don't have to worry.

987
01:04:55,479 --> 01:04:59,525
When it comes to sex,
Marty is the one who wants to wait.

988
01:05:00,693 --> 01:05:03,696
What about that sentence is
supposed to give me comfort?

989
01:05:04,029 --> 01:05:05,155
Dad, I love him.

990
01:05:05,322 --> 01:05:06,657
- Honey...
- I love him.

991
01:05:06,740 --> 01:05:08,325
I love him.

992
01:05:08,576 --> 01:05:09,660
I love him.

993
01:05:09,868 --> 01:05:10,911
No, you don't.

994
01:05:11,370 --> 01:05:13,622
What we have is true love.

995
01:05:13,914 --> 01:05:17,793
Just because you don't have it,
doesn't mean you have to punish us.

996
01:05:18,836 --> 01:05:23,257
Infatuation is not love.
Sexual attraction is not love.

997
01:05:23,340 --> 01:05:24,466
You don't understand.

998
01:05:24,675 --> 01:05:26,510
- I don't understand.
- No.

999
01:05:26,885 --> 01:05:28,929
No, you don't even understand
that you don't understand.

1000
01:05:29,096 --> 01:05:32,349
What don't I understand, Cara?
Please, help me out.

1001
01:05:32,516 --> 01:05:35,561
What is it? It's frustrating
that you can't be with this person?

1002
01:05:35,853 --> 01:05:40,024
That there's something keeping you
apart this person you connect with?

1003
01:05:40,441 --> 01:05:44,028
Whenever you're near this person,
you don't know what to say...

1004
01:05:44,111 --> 01:05:47,072
and you say everything that's
in your mind and in your heart.

1005
01:05:47,156 --> 01:05:49,617
And you know that
If you could just be together...

1006
01:05:50,075 --> 01:05:53,787
this person will help you become
the best version of yourself.

1007
01:05:54,204 --> 01:05:55,748
So Marty can stay?

1008
01:06:02,504 --> 01:06:03,881
I'm sorry.

1009
01:06:07,301 --> 01:06:08,427
I'm sorry.

1010
01:06:15,601 --> 01:06:17,478
"Marty can stay?"

1011
01:06:19,104 --> 01:06:20,814
Howard is going
to drive you to the bus.

1012
01:06:20,898 --> 01:06:23,025
We called your aunt,
she's waiting in Boston.

1013
01:06:23,108 --> 01:06:25,277
- Yes, sir.
- Look, I'm not your father...

1014
01:06:25,361 --> 01:06:27,988
but I think you should know,
love is a dangerous feeling.

1015
01:06:28,072 --> 01:06:29,114
No, sir.

1016
01:06:29,198 --> 01:06:31,825
- Are you arguing with me?
- No, but...

1017
01:06:37,957 --> 01:06:40,501
Love is not a feeling,
it's an ability.

1018
01:06:41,168 --> 01:06:42,211
Who told you that?

1019
01:06:42,795 --> 01:06:44,296
I made it up, Mr. Burns.

1020
01:06:50,052 --> 01:06:51,303
Come say goodbye.

1021
01:06:56,183 --> 01:06:57,268
- Window.
- I miss you.

1022
01:06:57,351 --> 01:07:00,062
- That's it.
- She'll see him soon enough.

1023
01:07:06,610 --> 01:07:07,653
No!

1024
01:07:08,237 --> 01:07:10,656
¡No, Marty!

1025
01:07:13,784 --> 01:07:14,910
That's sweet.

1026
01:07:15,202 --> 01:07:17,705
What's sweet?
How is that sweet?

1027
01:07:18,289 --> 01:07:20,833
It's ok. It's ok.
Come on, it's ok.

1028
01:07:20,916 --> 01:07:23,877
To be that certain.
To feel so much love.

1029
01:07:25,838 --> 01:07:27,840
Love isn't a feeling.

1030
01:07:28,048 --> 01:07:29,133
No?

1031
01:07:31,135 --> 01:07:32,511
It's an ability.

1032
01:07:36,765 --> 01:07:40,269
If that's true,
you have one gifted daughter.

1033
01:07:40,686 --> 01:07:41,937
This is horrible!

1034
01:07:42,980 --> 01:07:47,610
You're a murderer of love!

1035
01:07:54,033 --> 01:07:56,493
Ok, Cara. Next?

1036
01:07:56,577 --> 01:07:58,787
Olivia has something with the girls.

1037
01:07:59,038 --> 01:08:01,165
Gus will be doing his usual.

1038
01:08:01,248 --> 01:08:04,001
Bella is on the fence.
Howard and I will sing.

1039
01:08:04,084 --> 01:08:05,544
That's nice.

1040
01:08:05,628 --> 01:08:07,379
- Aunt Eileen?
- Put me down.

1041
01:08:07,463 --> 01:08:08,881
Really? What's your talent?

1042
01:08:08,964 --> 01:08:10,215
Murderer of love.

1043
01:08:12,343 --> 01:08:13,385
You were saying?

1044
01:08:13,469 --> 01:08:17,348
We've planned something
for the family. Put us all down.

1045
01:08:30,277 --> 01:08:32,613
- Bravo!
- What's your Dad's talent?

1046
01:08:33,239 --> 01:08:34,531
He doesn't have one.

1047
01:08:35,074 --> 01:08:37,701
He's the only one
excused from participating.

1048
01:08:39,370 --> 01:08:41,705
- I give you Bella Wilson.
- All right, Bella!

1049
01:08:43,290 --> 01:08:44,541
Chihuahua.

1050
01:08:48,796 --> 01:08:49,838
Go, Bella.

1051
01:08:49,838 --> 01:08:51,507
- Are you Ok?
- I don't have a good feeling.

1052
01:08:51,590 --> 01:08:52,967
Do what you always do.

1053
01:08:53,092 --> 01:08:55,761
Marie is not a lip-sync kinda girl.

1054
01:08:56,553 --> 01:09:00,266
- I gotta do something special.
- Just be yourself.

1055
01:09:00,599 --> 01:09:01,684
Bulldog.

1056
01:09:11,026 --> 01:09:12,069
That's it.

1057
01:09:20,494 --> 01:09:21,745
This is for Marty.

1058
01:09:21,870 --> 01:09:23,289
Do you want me
to take the cherries?

1059
01:09:24,832 --> 01:09:25,874
Ok.

1060
01:09:47,688 --> 01:09:48,814
She tied it!

1061
01:10:13,672 --> 01:10:14,882
I got an idea.

1062
01:10:15,174 --> 01:10:16,383
I'm sure it'll be great.

1063
01:10:17,885 --> 01:10:19,011
It could be.

1064
01:10:24,183 --> 01:10:27,144
Last but not least,
uncle Mitch.

1065
01:10:28,103 --> 01:10:30,731
Someone very wise, my brother...

1066
01:10:31,565 --> 01:10:35,819
once told me that if you wanna be
completely honest...

1067
01:10:37,029 --> 01:10:38,405
sing.

1068
01:10:39,448 --> 01:10:41,492
By the way,
I'd like to introduce my band.

1069
01:10:41,742 --> 01:10:42,910
Great!

1070
01:10:43,702 --> 01:10:44,912
I don't believe it.

1071
01:10:44,995 --> 01:10:46,830
He hasn't played since she...

1072
01:10:46,914 --> 01:10:48,165
1, 2, 3, 4.

1073
01:10:55,589 --> 01:10:57,967
When people keep repeating...

1074
01:10:58,509 --> 01:11:00,844
that you'll never fall in love...

1075
01:11:02,137 --> 01:11:04,890
When everybody keeps repeating...

1076
01:11:05,474 --> 01:11:07,977
- but you can't seem...
- to get enough.

1077
01:11:09,186 --> 01:11:11,272
Let my love open the door.

1078
01:11:12,439 --> 01:11:14,775
Let my love open the door.

1079
01:11:15,943 --> 01:11:18,195
Let my love open the door.

1080
01:11:19,071 --> 01:11:21,699
- to your heart.
- Let my love open the door.

1081
01:11:23,158 --> 01:11:25,286
Let my love open the door.

1082
01:11:26,662 --> 01:11:29,373
- When everything...
- feels all over.

1083
01:11:30,207 --> 01:11:32,835
When everybody seems unkind...

1084
01:11:33,752 --> 01:11:36,380
I'll give you a four-leaf clover.

1085
01:11:37,131 --> 01:11:39,466
Take all the worry out of your mind.

1086
01:11:43,053 --> 01:11:46,098
I have the only key to your heart.

1087
01:11:46,724 --> 01:11:49,476
I can stop you falling apart.

1088
01:11:49,560 --> 01:11:52,605
Release yourself from misery.

1089
01:11:53,022 --> 01:11:56,358
Only one thing
is gonna set you free.

1090
01:11:56,442 --> 01:11:58,027
That's my love.

1091
01:11:59,778 --> 01:12:01,363
And that's my love.

1092
01:12:03,324 --> 01:12:05,743
Let my love open the door.

1093
01:12:06,827 --> 01:12:09,288
Let my love open the door.

1094
01:12:10,080 --> 01:12:13,500
- Let my love open the door.
- Open the door.

1095
01:12:13,751 --> 01:12:16,754
- Let my love open the door.
- Let my love open the door...

1096
01:12:16,962 --> 01:12:19,256
- to your heart.
- Let my love open the door.

1097
01:12:19,340 --> 01:12:22,718
Let my love open the door
to your heart.

1098
01:12:24,511 --> 01:12:25,804
Great job, guys!

1099
01:12:28,641 --> 01:12:29,892
You're amazing!

1100
01:12:33,103 --> 01:12:35,940
When tragedy befalls you...

1101
01:12:37,691 --> 01:12:40,069
don't let them bring you down.

1102
01:12:42,238 --> 01:12:45,324
Love can cure your problems.

1103
01:12:46,200 --> 01:12:49,370
You're so lucky I'm around.

1104
01:12:51,372 --> 01:12:54,375
Let my love open the door.

1105
01:12:56,627 --> 01:12:59,380
Let my love open the door.

1106
01:13:01,173 --> 01:13:04,176
Let my love open the door...

1107
01:13:05,344 --> 01:13:07,471
to your heart.

1108
01:13:12,601 --> 01:13:13,811
What he said.

1109
01:13:23,195 --> 01:13:24,238
Great, guys!

1110
01:13:35,040 --> 01:13:36,083
What was that?

1111
01:13:36,292 --> 01:13:37,585
I couldn't...

1112
01:13:38,085 --> 01:13:39,587
I couldn't stop myself.

1113
01:13:40,004 --> 01:13:41,630
What am I supposed to do now?

1114
01:13:42,715 --> 01:13:43,757
You can't do anything.

1115
01:13:44,258 --> 01:13:45,301
He's my brother.

1116
01:13:45,801 --> 01:13:48,470
Why did you sing for me... then?

1117
01:13:49,179 --> 01:13:50,681
Because I'm...

1118
01:13:57,938 --> 01:14:01,942
Page 92. "Did I just die?
Because an angel walked into the room."

1119
01:14:02,067 --> 01:14:06,906
Page 148: "I'll forgive you your
past, if you'll forgive me mine."

1120
01:14:07,406 --> 01:14:09,533
It seems all his
best lines were yours.

1121
01:14:13,954 --> 01:14:15,331
It's unbearable.

1122
01:14:15,831 --> 01:14:17,124
I...

1123
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:19,835
I can't keep pretending.

1124
01:14:36,268 --> 01:14:37,311
Dad?

1125
01:14:38,145 --> 01:14:39,188
Yeah, peanut.

1126
01:14:39,355 --> 01:14:42,274
Will you come up to my room?
I wanna show you something I made.

1127
01:14:42,900 --> 01:14:46,028
We'll do it tomorrow.
Ok, sweetie? I promise.

1128
01:14:48,864 --> 01:14:50,241
Ok, Dad.

1129
01:14:56,205 --> 01:14:57,248
It can't be!

1130
01:14:57,456 --> 01:14:59,250
You're a great guy,
but I can't be with you.

1131
01:14:59,333 --> 01:15:00,668
No, please.

1132
01:15:03,212 --> 01:15:04,546
- Please.
- I'm sorry.

1133
01:15:04,964 --> 01:15:06,048
What's going on?

1134
01:15:07,925 --> 01:15:11,804
What is complicated being here?

1135
01:15:12,555 --> 01:15:15,266
My singing.
I shouldn't have sang.

1136
01:15:17,017 --> 01:15:18,686
It was a bad song.

1137
01:15:18,978 --> 01:15:20,437
Is she crying or laughing?

1138
01:15:25,818 --> 01:15:27,444
- No, no.
- Please.

1139
01:15:27,570 --> 01:15:29,113
Please don't do it.

1140
01:15:29,989 --> 01:15:31,031
Marie!

1141
01:15:43,961 --> 01:15:45,004
Here he comes.

1142
01:15:45,170 --> 01:15:46,255
Mom!

1143
01:15:46,797 --> 01:15:50,884
I don't know what to say to him.
I never lost a girl.

1144
01:15:51,302 --> 01:15:53,262
- This is a first.
- Yes.

1145
01:15:53,345 --> 01:15:54,930
Come on, do something!

1146
01:15:55,472 --> 01:15:58,851
- I'll follow through with these.
- Who wants some cereals?

1147
01:16:01,979 --> 01:16:03,647
Please stop trying to act normal.

1148
01:16:12,865 --> 01:16:14,450
She said I was a great guy...

1149
01:16:15,534 --> 01:16:17,536
she said she loved me a lot.

1150
01:16:19,163 --> 01:16:20,456
And then she said...

1151
01:16:22,166 --> 01:16:24,501
we should both go find
our own true soul mates.

1152
01:16:25,586 --> 01:16:26,629
I'm so confused.

1153
01:16:26,712 --> 01:16:30,633
I don't really know what happened
from yesterday to today.

1154
01:16:31,091 --> 01:16:34,470
There has to be something,
a reason...

1155
01:16:35,846 --> 01:16:37,723
- Why are you looking at me?
- Not looking at you.

1156
01:16:37,848 --> 01:16:41,727
He looks into the vast void that is
his future. You happen to be there.

1157
01:16:43,354 --> 01:16:44,855
Do you have anything to add?

1158
01:16:44,939 --> 01:16:47,149
What does the expert have to say?

1159
01:16:48,525 --> 01:16:49,568
Honey...

1160
01:16:49,652 --> 01:16:52,905
the hard truth is
we all liked her a lot.

1161
01:16:53,405 --> 01:16:54,949
Yeah, we really did.

1162
01:16:58,369 --> 01:17:00,871
This isn't helping. No.

1163
01:17:02,081 --> 01:17:03,791
Could somebody think
of something fun to do?

1164
01:17:04,917 --> 01:17:06,377
Let's see...

1165
01:17:06,794 --> 01:17:09,088
Part of the Rat Pack! Singer.

1166
01:17:09,672 --> 01:17:12,841
- Dean Martin! Sammy Davis, Jr!
- Sammy Davis, Jr!

1167
01:17:14,927 --> 01:17:16,178
Yes!

1168
01:17:17,388 --> 01:17:20,724
- Your turn, buddy.
- Come on. Let's do it.

1169
01:17:20,849 --> 01:17:22,643
- Come on Mitch!
- Go!

1170
01:17:25,187 --> 01:17:28,107
- This is a gift from the French...
- Hi, Jordy.

1171
01:17:28,566 --> 01:17:30,734
- You can't talk.
- No, but go on.

1172
01:17:30,776 --> 01:17:32,486
- I had to leave.
- I know.

1173
01:17:32,736 --> 01:17:34,488
- A kite with a key...
- Ben Franklin!

1174
01:17:34,572 --> 01:17:36,240
But the truth is...

1175
01:17:37,116 --> 01:17:39,159
- Yeah?
- I didn't get very far.

1176
01:17:39,285 --> 01:17:42,121
Beautiful smile, lovely eyes,
one-of-a-kind woman.

1177
01:17:42,329 --> 01:17:44,039
- Marie!
- Yes.

1178
01:17:44,290 --> 01:17:45,332
Mitch.

1179
01:17:45,624 --> 01:17:48,210
Honey, don't.

1180
01:17:54,592 --> 01:17:56,886
- Dad?
- Hey, you.

1181
01:17:57,303 --> 01:17:58,721
Can I show you what I made?

1182
01:17:59,096 --> 01:18:00,848
First thing when I get back, ok?

1183
01:18:02,474 --> 01:18:03,517
Ok.

1184
01:18:17,364 --> 01:18:18,407
You again.

1185
01:18:18,616 --> 01:18:20,993
Nice to see you, officer.
How are you today?

1186
01:18:21,452 --> 01:18:23,370
- You know why I pulled you over?
- I sure do.

1187
01:18:23,913 --> 01:18:27,041
I know what I was doing
and I know it's all wrong.

1188
01:18:27,583 --> 01:18:30,127
- This is gonna cost you.
- Put it on my tab.

1189
01:18:32,171 --> 01:18:34,006
- What was that?
- Put it on my tab.

1190
01:19:05,329 --> 01:19:06,580
What are we doing?

1191
01:19:08,249 --> 01:19:10,167
- It may be wrong.
- Yes.

1192
01:19:10,251 --> 01:19:13,087
But there's a certain rightness
to our wrongness.

1193
01:19:13,879 --> 01:19:18,759
I think we've got to think
In your girls and how do we...

1194
01:19:19,093 --> 01:19:20,761
They're extraordinary and...

1195
01:19:24,557 --> 01:19:25,683
What?

1196
01:19:27,393 --> 01:19:29,520
I think this is all premature.

1197
01:19:34,108 --> 01:19:35,359
You do?

1198
01:19:39,446 --> 01:19:41,365
We don't even know
if you can bowl.

1199
01:19:59,884 --> 01:20:01,385
All right. No, don't!

1200
01:20:01,552 --> 01:20:02,636
Wait!

1201
01:20:02,720 --> 01:20:04,513
- You have to line up.
- Leave me alone!

1202
01:20:04,597 --> 01:20:05,973
- Come on.
- Line up, come on.

1203
01:20:06,056 --> 01:20:08,976
I'm just watching you.
I'm not...

1204
01:20:09,852 --> 01:20:12,187
If you laugh, you won't be able to.
Are you ready?

1205
01:20:13,939 --> 01:20:15,649
Nice!

1206
01:20:15,858 --> 01:20:16,901
Thank you.

1207
01:20:20,029 --> 01:20:21,614
That was a terrible shot...

1208
01:20:21,697 --> 01:20:23,157
but I loved this at the end.

1209
01:20:24,909 --> 01:20:26,243
I wouldn't go yet.

1210
01:20:30,873 --> 01:20:32,708
- Not bad.
- Two. That's good!

1211
01:20:39,715 --> 01:20:41,175
You'll break your arm like that.

1212
01:20:53,771 --> 01:20:55,189
Come on!

1213
01:20:56,106 --> 01:20:57,149
Come on!

1214
01:20:57,274 --> 01:20:59,818
Let's go at the same time.
1, 2, y 3.

1215
01:21:26,929 --> 01:21:28,055
Dad?

1216
01:21:29,098 --> 01:21:31,058
Oh, my God.
Dad, what are you doing?

1217
01:21:32,059 --> 01:21:33,269
What the hell? Marie?

1218
01:21:33,435 --> 01:21:35,271
- Hey.
- What the hell's going on?

1219
01:21:35,437 --> 01:21:36,730
- We'll go.
- They were just kissing.

1220
01:21:36,981 --> 01:21:38,983
- Are you sure?
- That's ridiculous.

1221
01:21:39,066 --> 01:21:40,109
I can explain.

1222
01:21:40,401 --> 01:21:41,860
What?

1223
01:21:41,944 --> 01:21:42,987
You two broke up, right?

1224
01:21:43,070 --> 01:21:45,364
Two hours ago.
We broke up two hours ago.

1225
01:21:45,447 --> 01:21:46,865
- How could you?
- I know.

1226
01:21:46,949 --> 01:21:48,617
- Listen.
- Marie, I thought that you left.

1227
01:21:49,034 --> 01:21:52,162
She did. She left,
but she just didn't get very far.

1228
01:21:52,329 --> 01:21:54,123
- What?
- I can explain this.

1229
01:21:54,206 --> 01:21:56,333
- I can explain this.
- Let him explain.

1230
01:21:56,709 --> 01:21:59,712
Remember the woman
at the bookstore?

1231
01:22:01,630 --> 01:22:02,715
Here she is.

1232
01:22:04,216 --> 01:22:06,093
You told me to go after her,
and I didn't.

1233
01:22:06,176 --> 01:22:08,095
It wasn't planned, Mitch.

1234
01:22:08,387 --> 01:22:09,847
I know how this looks.

1235
01:22:10,139 --> 01:22:12,099
But, Mitch,
I also know how it feels.

1236
01:22:12,433 --> 01:22:14,059
How does this feel,
you son of a bitch?

1237
01:22:14,393 --> 01:22:15,561
Oh, my God!

1238
01:22:16,604 --> 01:22:18,731
- What happened?
- I'm so sorry.

1239
01:22:18,981 --> 01:22:21,275
Everybody, take it easy.
You're not helping.

1240
01:22:21,692 --> 01:22:23,944
I'm sorry.

1241
01:22:24,945 --> 01:22:26,864
Darling, get some ice.

1242
01:22:27,281 --> 01:22:28,991
- Dad?
- Dan, are you all right?

1243
01:22:29,241 --> 01:22:30,284
Marie!

1244
01:22:32,244 --> 01:22:33,454
No, don't go!

1245
01:22:33,996 --> 01:22:36,206
I don't know what we were thinking.

1246
01:22:38,375 --> 01:22:39,418
I'm sorry.

1247
01:22:41,503 --> 01:22:42,713
Don't go.

1248
01:22:47,718 --> 01:22:48,761
Dad!

1249
01:22:49,595 --> 01:22:50,804
Dad, wait!

1250
01:22:51,972 --> 01:22:53,015
What are you doing?

1251
01:22:53,474 --> 01:22:54,516
Dad!

1252
01:23:07,321 --> 01:23:09,365
This is your summons
for your court appearance.

1253
01:23:10,366 --> 01:23:12,868
One last thing.
You need to surrender your license.

1254
01:23:28,259 --> 01:23:29,426
You have guests.

1255
01:23:34,056 --> 01:23:35,516
Speak of the devil.

1256
01:23:35,641 --> 01:23:36,850
- Hi.
- Cindy Lamson.

1257
01:23:36,934 --> 01:23:39,144
Editor of special features,
Lamson Newspaper Group.

1258
01:23:39,228 --> 01:23:41,021
- Hi.
- Jim Lamson, publisher.

1259
01:23:41,105 --> 01:23:42,523
- Nice to meet you.
- Yes.

1260
01:23:42,731 --> 01:23:45,150
We've been sitting here
chatting with your family.

1261
01:23:46,235 --> 01:23:50,072
We've enjoyed the pleasure
of meeting your lovely daughters.

1262
01:23:51,198 --> 01:23:53,117
- Hot cider?
- Thank you.

1263
01:23:53,951 --> 01:23:56,161
- Thank you very much.
- Thanks.

1264
01:23:58,914 --> 01:24:01,208
Father? Hot cider?

1265
01:24:01,709 --> 01:24:03,586
Not only are you
a murderer of love...

1266
01:24:03,752 --> 01:24:05,629
but you're the worst parent ever.

1267
01:24:08,382 --> 01:24:09,758
- Charming!
- How sweet!

1268
01:24:10,217 --> 01:24:12,970
As you probably know...

1269
01:24:13,304 --> 01:24:15,514
we have met
with two other candidates, but...

1270
01:24:15,931 --> 01:24:19,643
my father and I are confident
we have saved the best for last.

1271
01:24:21,896 --> 01:24:24,148
Girls, you can leave if you like.

1272
01:24:24,231 --> 01:24:28,694
Perhaps they should stay.
We like to keep the family involved.

1273
01:24:29,028 --> 01:24:32,907
He knows all about
keeping things in the family.

1274
01:24:33,198 --> 01:24:35,784
- Don't you, Dan?
- That's why we're so drawn to you.

1275
01:24:36,160 --> 01:24:38,871
What you represent in your column,
your moral values.

1276
01:24:39,079 --> 01:24:43,876
The personal characteristics
that are reflected in your writing...

1277
01:24:43,959 --> 01:24:45,294
honesty, trustworthiness...

1278
01:24:45,377 --> 01:24:47,379
We have great plans for you, Dan.

1279
01:24:47,713 --> 01:24:51,508
We try to do what you
keep telling your readers to do.

1280
01:24:52,301 --> 01:24:53,344
What's that?

1281
01:24:53,761 --> 01:24:55,137
Put family first.

1282
01:24:56,347 --> 01:24:58,140
Here's the thing.

1283
01:25:00,309 --> 01:25:03,604
Somebody hasn't been
reading his own column.

1284
01:25:05,397 --> 01:25:07,024
I'm not sure what that means.

1285
01:25:20,037 --> 01:25:21,163
Go away.

1286
01:25:21,580 --> 01:25:23,082
You're a liar and a hypocrite.

1287
01:25:23,165 --> 01:25:24,792
Cheating with
your brother's girlfriend.

1288
01:25:24,917 --> 01:25:28,170
- How long did you know her?
- Two violations and a collision?

1289
01:25:28,629 --> 01:25:30,381
Was that part of the "plan"?

1290
01:25:30,965 --> 01:25:33,509
Worst of all, you blew off Lilly.

1291
01:25:33,676 --> 01:25:36,428
She's been wanting to show you
something she made for you.

1292
01:25:36,512 --> 01:25:37,972
But you never showed up.

1293
01:26:11,922 --> 01:26:15,259
FOR DAD

1294
01:27:12,191 --> 01:27:13,609
I really messed up.

1295
01:27:13,692 --> 01:27:15,903
- No, you didn't.
- Yeah, I did, Mom.

1296
01:27:16,195 --> 01:27:17,696
What I did to Lilly.

1297
01:27:17,821 --> 01:27:19,073
Don't forget Mitch.

1298
01:27:19,198 --> 01:27:20,324
John!

1299
01:27:20,616 --> 01:27:22,076
And those newspaper people.

1300
01:27:22,952 --> 01:27:25,120
Not a good day for you, honey.

1301
01:27:27,623 --> 01:27:30,125
If I just stay focused
on being their dad.

1302
01:27:30,209 --> 01:27:33,295
Please, love is messy.

1303
01:27:33,504 --> 01:27:34,797
I should know better.

1304
01:27:36,382 --> 01:27:38,842
- I hurt my kids.
- Go un-hurt them.

1305
01:27:39,552 --> 01:27:41,929
- You've made some mistakes.
- Many.

1306
01:27:42,179 --> 01:27:43,597
So many.

1307
01:27:44,014 --> 01:27:46,225
Falling for Marie
wasn't one of them.

1308
01:27:50,646 --> 01:27:52,856
Can somebody get me another box?

1309
01:27:53,357 --> 01:27:55,276
Yep, coming.

1310
01:27:57,945 --> 01:27:58,988
Mitch.

1311
01:28:01,240 --> 01:28:02,366
Mitch, I...

1312
01:28:07,288 --> 01:28:09,039
If it was anybody else...

1313
01:28:09,999 --> 01:28:12,167
I am so...

1314
01:28:16,005 --> 01:28:17,298
Hold that thought.

1315
01:28:23,053 --> 01:28:24,221
Hey, beautiful.

1316
01:28:43,699 --> 01:28:44,909
Girls...

1317
01:28:46,535 --> 01:28:48,954
I'd like to talk
to Lilly alone, if I could.

1318
01:29:00,841 --> 01:29:02,301
Ok, then. All of you.

1319
01:29:13,103 --> 01:29:15,314
I know I messed up. Big time.

1320
01:29:15,856 --> 01:29:17,233
- Yep.
- Yes, you did.

1321
01:29:18,108 --> 01:29:19,318
Now...

1322
01:29:19,735 --> 01:29:20,986
your mom...

1323
01:29:23,364 --> 01:29:24,573
I miss your mom.

1324
01:29:25,491 --> 01:29:27,826
All the time and I always will.

1325
01:29:27,952 --> 01:29:29,119
Mom's gone.

1326
01:29:29,370 --> 01:29:32,081
Honey, I see her every day.

1327
01:29:32,665 --> 01:29:34,875
I see her in your goodness, Jane.

1328
01:29:34,959 --> 01:29:37,586
And, Cara, your passion.

1329
01:29:39,171 --> 01:29:41,715
And, Lilly, you have her eyes.

1330
01:29:42,841 --> 01:29:44,093
And her smile.

1331
01:29:46,720 --> 01:29:48,597
So here's what I'm going to do:

1332
01:29:48,681 --> 01:29:52,017
I'm grounding myself for life.

1333
01:29:52,560 --> 01:29:55,938
I'm sticking with you.
I am going to be with you.

1334
01:29:56,021 --> 01:29:57,606
You're with us every day.

1335
01:29:58,023 --> 01:29:59,692
I'm not going anywhere.

1336
01:30:00,818 --> 01:30:04,321
I got a little confused with Marie...

1337
01:30:04,905 --> 01:30:07,575
but that is over. Ok?

1338
01:30:09,326 --> 01:30:11,829
I kinda lost my head.

1339
01:30:14,123 --> 01:30:17,001
Got a little stupid
because I love her.

1340
01:30:18,544 --> 01:30:19,753
That's not...

1341
01:30:20,087 --> 01:30:21,338
That's not...

1342
01:30:22,631 --> 01:30:24,675
I don't love her.
And that's not what I meant.

1343
01:30:24,967 --> 01:30:27,219
How could I love her?
I've only known her...

1344
01:30:27,303 --> 01:30:29,138
- Three days.
- Yeah.

1345
01:30:30,806 --> 01:30:34,101
And how can you know in three days?

1346
01:30:38,522 --> 01:30:39,857
I don't know.

1347
01:30:40,149 --> 01:30:41,901
Yes, I know. I love her.

1348
01:30:43,694 --> 01:30:47,573
Yes, I do. I love her.

1349
01:30:49,867 --> 01:30:51,035
I love her.

1350
01:30:54,747 --> 01:30:56,040
Then go get her.

1351
01:30:58,459 --> 01:31:00,169
We so prefer her to you.

1352
01:31:10,679 --> 01:31:11,889
Go.

1353
01:31:15,601 --> 01:31:16,644
Now.

1354
01:31:26,237 --> 01:31:28,280
Honey, for the road.

1355
01:31:38,249 --> 01:31:39,375
What is it?

1356
01:31:39,458 --> 01:31:41,126
- I can't do it.
- You must.

1357
01:31:41,210 --> 01:31:42,419
I don't have a license.

1358
01:31:43,379 --> 01:31:44,421
Damn it!

1359
01:32:00,229 --> 01:32:01,897
I'm pretty good with maps.

1360
01:32:03,399 --> 01:32:05,109
This is so queer.

1361
01:32:06,318 --> 01:32:07,945
But I wouldn't miss it for anything.

1362
01:32:19,748 --> 01:32:23,669
Dear readers, for most of you,
this is my first column...

1363
01:32:23,752 --> 01:32:25,129
in your paper.

1364
01:32:25,462 --> 01:32:29,049
In the future, I'll answer
your questions, but today...

1365
01:32:29,133 --> 01:32:31,176
I wanna break
from my usual format...

1366
01:32:31,260 --> 01:32:34,054
and talk to you
about the subject of plans.

1367
01:32:34,972 --> 01:32:37,016
Not so much my plan
for this column...

1368
01:32:37,099 --> 01:32:40,311
more like life plans.
How we all make them.

1369
01:32:40,644 --> 01:32:44,940
We hope our kids make good,
smart, safe plans of their own.

1370
01:32:47,818 --> 01:32:49,612
But if we're really
honest with ourselves...

1371
01:32:49,820 --> 01:32:53,449
most of the time our plans
don't work out as we'd hoped.

1372
01:32:58,662 --> 01:33:00,539
So instead of asking
our young people:

1373
01:33:00,623 --> 01:33:01,916
"What are your plans?"

1374
01:33:02,207 --> 01:33:04,501
"What do you plan
to do with your life?"

1375
01:33:04,793 --> 01:33:06,420
Maybe we should tell them this:

1376
01:33:07,171 --> 01:33:09,924
"Plan to be surprised."

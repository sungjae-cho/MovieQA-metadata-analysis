1
00:00:55,224 --> 00:01:11,224


2
00:01:11,225 --> 00:01:13,876
M doesn’t mind you earning
a little money on the side, Dryden.

3
00:01:14,393 --> 00:01:17,589
She’d just prefer it
if it wasn’t selling secrets.

4
00:01:26,298 --> 00:01:28,339
If the theatrics
are supposed to scare me…

5
00:01:28,538 --> 00:01:30,927
…you have the wrong man, Bond.

6
00:01:31,482 --> 00:01:34,352
If M was so sure that I was bent…

7
00:01:34,554 --> 00:01:36,409
…she’d have sent a double-0.

8
00:01:37,371 --> 00:01:39,673
Benefits of being section chief…

9
00:01:39,867 --> 00:01:42,420
…I’d know if anyone had been
promoted to double-0 status…

10
00:01:42,619 --> 00:01:43,864
…wouldn’t I?

11
00:01:44,923 --> 00:01:49,233
-Your file shows no kills, and it takes –
-Two.

12
00:02:05,725 --> 00:02:07,416
Shame.

13
00:02:07,773 --> 00:02:09,977
We barely got to know each other.

14
00:02:13,501 --> 00:02:14,996
I know where you keep your gun.

15
00:02:16,925 --> 00:02:18,867
I suppose that’s something.

16
00:02:20,158 --> 00:02:22,099
True.

17
00:02:22,942 --> 00:02:24,251
How did he die?

18
00:02:24,445 --> 00:02:25,853
Your contact?

19
00:02:26,526 --> 00:02:27,474
Not well.

20
00:03:10,912 --> 00:03:12,505
Made you feel it, did he?

21
00:03:15,841 --> 00:03:17,532
Well…

22
00:03:17,857 --> 00:03:19,864
…you needn’t worry.

23
00:03:20,385 --> 00:03:21,911
The second is –

24
00:03:25,729 --> 00:03:27,485
Yes.

25
00:03:27,841 --> 00:03:30,230
Considerably.

26
00:07:14,159 --> 00:07:17,933
So how do I trust this man
that I’ve never met with my money?

27
00:07:18,254 --> 00:07:20,589
You asked for the introduction.

28
00:07:20,783 --> 00:07:22,922
That’s all my organization
will guarantee.

29
00:08:01,618 --> 00:08:04,236
I suppose our friend
Mr. White will have told you…

30
00:08:04,433 --> 00:08:06,605
…that I have provided
reliable banking services…

31
00:08:06,802 --> 00:08:09,388
…for many other
freedom fighters over the years.

32
00:08:13,971 --> 00:08:16,174
Do you believe in God,
Mr. Le Chiffre?

33
00:08:16,371 --> 00:08:17,931
No.

34
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:20,683
I believe in
a reasonable rate of return.

35
00:08:20,883 --> 00:08:23,054
I want no risk in the portfolio.

36
00:08:23,251 --> 00:08:24,462
Agreed.

37
00:08:24,659 --> 00:08:26,382
And I can access it
anywhere in the world?

38
00:08:26,674 --> 00:08:27,722
Yes.

39
00:08:45,524 --> 00:08:48,045
I have the money,
so short another million shares…

40
00:08:48,244 --> 00:08:49,837
…of skyfleet stock.

41
00:08:50,036 --> 00:08:53,746
Sir, you must know you’re betting
against the market.

42
00:08:53,941 --> 00:08:56,974
No one expects this stock
to go anywhere but up.

43
00:08:57,173 --> 00:08:59,759
Just do it.

44
00:09:33,111 --> 00:09:35,479
Looks like our man.
Burn scars on his face.

45
00:09:37,944 --> 00:09:40,464
I wonder if bomb-makers
are insured for things like that.

46
00:09:54,712 --> 00:09:56,054
He’s on the move.

47
00:09:56,664 --> 00:09:59,031
He’s on the move,
and he’s heading straight for me.

48
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:01,808
Stop touching your ear.

49
00:10:02,009 --> 00:10:03,984
-Sorry?
-Put your hand down.

50
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,590
Holster the bloody weapon, Carter.
I need him alive.

51
00:19:20,474 --> 00:19:23,256
Weeping blood comes merely
from a derangement of the tear duct…

52
00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:24,792
…my dear general.

53
00:19:25,722 --> 00:19:26,932
Nothing sinister.

54
00:19:31,994 --> 00:19:33,304
All in.

55
00:19:36,091 --> 00:19:38,993
I have two pair, and you have
a 17.4 percent chance…

56
00:19:39,195 --> 00:19:41,203
…of making your straight.

57
00:20:06,557 --> 00:20:08,794
When does Ellipsis expire?

58
00:20:08,989 --> 00:20:12,023
-We have less than thirty-six hours. I can –
-No. No, no.

59
00:20:12,221 --> 00:20:14,839
That’s all the time I have anyway.

60
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:18,614
Give our guests
five minutes to leave…

61
00:20:18,813 --> 00:20:21,018
…or throw them overboard.

62
00:20:32,095 --> 00:20:33,785
Who the hell do they think they are?

63
00:20:33,983 --> 00:20:36,372
I report to the prime minister,
even he’s smart enough…

64
00:20:36,574 --> 00:20:37,720
…not to ask me what we do.

65
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:41,465
Have you ever seen such a bunch
of self-righteous, arse-covering prigs?

66
00:20:41,663 --> 00:20:44,347
They don’t care what we do, they care
what we get photographed doing.

67
00:20:44,639 --> 00:20:47,094
And how the hell
could Bond be so stupid?

68
00:20:47,295 --> 00:20:50,045
I give him double-0 status,
he celebrates by shooting an embassy.

69
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,541
Is the man deranged?
And where the hell is he?

70
00:20:52,735 --> 00:20:55,157
In the old days, if an agent
did something embarrassing…

71
00:20:55,359 --> 00:20:56,920
…he’d have the good sense
to defect.

72
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,876
Christ, I miss the Cold War.

73
00:22:12,357 --> 00:22:13,950
You’ve got a bloody cheek.

74
00:22:14,148 --> 00:22:15,577
Sorry.

75
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:17,504
I’ll shoot the camera first next time.

76
00:22:17,701 --> 00:22:19,294
Or yourself.

77
00:22:19,493 --> 00:22:21,435
You stormed into an embassy.

78
00:22:21,637 --> 00:22:24,059
You violated the only
absolutely inviolate rule…

79
00:22:24,261 --> 00:22:25,788
…of international relationships.

80
00:22:25,989 --> 00:22:27,844
And why?
So you could kill a nobody.

81
00:22:28,037 --> 00:22:29,663
We wanted to question him,
not kill him.

82
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:33,892
For God’s sake. You’re supposed
to display some kind of judgment.

83
00:22:34,086 --> 00:22:35,101
I did.

84
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:38,172
I thought one less bomb-maker
in the world would be good.

85
00:22:38,374 --> 00:22:40,098
Exactly. One bomb-maker.

86
00:22:40,614 --> 00:22:43,963
We’re trying to find out how an entire
network of terrorist groups is financed…

87
00:22:44,166 --> 00:22:45,595
…and you give us one bomb-maker.

88
00:22:45,799 --> 00:22:47,839
Hardly the big picture,
wouldn’t you say?

89
00:22:48,039 --> 00:22:51,138
The man isn’t even a true believer.
He’s a gun for hire.

90
00:22:51,334 --> 00:22:53,091
And thanks to your trigger finger…

91
00:22:53,287 --> 00:22:56,037
…we have no idea
who hired him or why.

92
00:22:56,231 --> 00:22:58,467
And how the hell
did you find out where I lived?

93
00:22:58,663 --> 00:23:00,190
The same way
I found out your name.

94
00:23:00,392 --> 00:23:03,206
I thought “M” was randomly assigned.
I had no idea it stood for –

95
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,767
Utter one more syllable
and I’ll have you killed.

96
00:23:07,207 --> 00:23:09,793
I knew it was too early
to promote you.

97
00:23:10,312 --> 00:23:14,087
Well, I understand double-0s
have a very short life-expectancy…

98
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:16,385
…so your mistake will be short-lived.

99
00:23:22,377 --> 00:23:27,079
Bond, this may be too much
for a blunt instrument to understand…

100
00:23:27,273 --> 00:23:30,502
…but arrogance and self-awareness
seldom go hand in hand.

101
00:23:31,113 --> 00:23:33,698
So you want me to be half monk,
half hit-man?

102
00:23:33,897 --> 00:23:35,686
Any thug can kill.

103
00:23:35,881 --> 00:23:38,183
I want you to take your ego
out of the equation…

104
00:23:38,377 --> 00:23:40,799
…and to judge the situation
dispassionately.

105
00:23:41,642 --> 00:23:44,610
I have to know I can trust you,
and that you know who to trust.

106
00:23:45,866 --> 00:23:49,248
And since I don’t know that,
I need you out of my sight.

107
00:23:49,450 --> 00:23:51,392
Go and stick your head
in the sand somewhere…

108
00:23:51,594 --> 00:23:52,904
…and think about your future.

109
00:23:53,099 --> 00:23:55,881
Because these bastards
want your head.

110
00:23:56,075 --> 00:23:59,391
And I’m seriously considering
feeding you to them.

111
00:24:06,443 --> 00:24:08,353
And Bond…

112
00:24:11,627 --> 00:24:14,115
…don’t ever break into
my house again.

113
00:24:15,051 --> 00:24:16,874
Ma’am.

114
00:25:26,608 --> 00:25:29,325
Good day, sir,
and welcome to the Ocean Club.

115
00:25:34,129 --> 00:25:36,268
Hey. Hey.

116
00:25:47,953 --> 00:25:49,514
Hello.

117
00:25:49,714 --> 00:25:51,753
Are you going to take this
or make me wait?

118
00:25:52,754 --> 00:25:55,121
Certainly, sir. Sorry, sir.

119
00:26:36,756 --> 00:26:39,571
Security to car park.
Security to car park.

120
00:26:39,765 --> 00:26:41,391
Absolutely incredible.

121
00:28:16,442 --> 00:28:18,831
Welcome to the Ocean Club, sir.
Checking in?

122
00:28:19,034 --> 00:28:22,329
Yes. But it’s a spur-of-the-moment
thing, and I haven’t got a reservation.

123
00:28:22,522 --> 00:28:23,864
Okay.

124
00:28:25,307 --> 00:28:28,536
-We have an ocean-view villa.
-Perfect.

125
00:28:31,451 --> 00:28:33,688
Could you do me a favor?
I was here last night…

126
00:28:33,883 --> 00:28:37,680
…and I parked my car next to
a very beautiful 1964 Aston Martin.

127
00:28:37,883 --> 00:28:39,891
I nicked the door.
You wouldn’t happen to know--?

128
00:28:40,091 --> 00:28:42,426
-Mr. Dimitrios.
-Right.

129
00:28:43,035 --> 00:28:45,240
If he hasn’t noticed,
I’m not sure I’d mention it.

130
00:28:45,435 --> 00:28:47,061
Isn’t the type
to take bad news well.

131
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:50,748
But if I felt compelled to find him?

132
00:28:51,837 --> 00:28:53,877
He has a house just up the beach.

133
00:28:55,452 --> 00:28:56,697
Thank you.

134
00:29:55,296 --> 00:29:57,882
-What?
-He’s in the Bahamas.

135
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:00,415
You woke me
to share his holiday plans?

136
00:30:00,608 --> 00:30:02,496
Well, he’s logged into
our secure website…

137
00:30:02,689 --> 00:30:04,664
…using your name and password.

138
00:30:04,865 --> 00:30:07,615
Well, how the hell
does he know these things?

139
00:30:07,809 --> 00:30:10,078
Well, I’m doing my best to find out.

140
00:30:10,273 --> 00:30:13,982
-Who’s he looking at?
-Alex Dimitrios.

141
00:30:14,369 --> 00:30:15,929
That slimy bugger.

142
00:30:26,082 --> 00:30:27,905
Now known associates….

143
00:30:39,138 --> 00:30:40,513
Le Chiffre.

144
00:30:56,260 --> 00:30:58,813
We’ve had a good night,
we’ve had a few drinks.

145
00:30:59,716 --> 00:31:01,375
How can I assist you, sir?

146
00:31:01,572 --> 00:31:03,710
Good evening.
Large Mount Gay with soda, please.

147
00:31:04,548 --> 00:31:06,436
-Look what just happened.
-Good job, big boy.

148
00:31:06,628 --> 00:31:07,806
Yeah.

149
00:31:15,365 --> 00:31:16,292
Do you mind if I join?

150
00:31:16,484 --> 00:31:18,623
-Oh, good evening. How are you?
-Good evening.

151
00:31:29,798 --> 00:31:31,653
Small blind, big blind.

152
00:31:31,845 --> 00:31:33,439
I’m in.

153
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:37,375
Bet’s to you.

154
00:31:39,942 --> 00:31:42,593
If that was for luck,
you’re two hours late.

155
00:31:44,135 --> 00:31:46,274
Two hundred to you.

156
00:31:50,951 --> 00:31:52,161
Bet’s to you.

157
00:31:52,359 --> 00:31:53,788
I heard you.

158
00:31:54,408 --> 00:31:56,099
Five to call.

159
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:00,803
-Action’s to you.
-Pair of sevens.

160
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,309
Ace high.

161
00:32:03,912 --> 00:32:05,319
Check or bet.

162
00:32:05,512 --> 00:32:06,941
-Check.
-And to you.

163
00:32:07,144 --> 00:32:09,000
Five thousand.

164
00:32:12,905 --> 00:32:14,182
Five to call.

165
00:32:25,545 --> 00:32:27,814
-Check.
-Check to you, sir.

166
00:32:29,545 --> 00:32:30,690
All in.

167
00:32:31,337 --> 00:32:33,061
No, wait.

168
00:32:33,449 --> 00:32:34,857
Twenty thousand.

169
00:32:35,178 --> 00:32:37,480
Table stakes. I’m sorry, sir.

170
00:32:39,946 --> 00:32:43,808
Okay. This is on the table.
That’s my car. Wanna bet?

171
00:32:45,418 --> 00:32:47,207
I’m sorry, Mr. Dimitrios.

172
00:32:47,402 --> 00:32:50,272
Please, no. Give him a chance
to win his money back.

173
00:33:00,075 --> 00:33:01,733
All right, show me, gentlemen.

174
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:07,913
Three kings.

175
00:33:13,837 --> 00:33:15,527
There you go with my night.

176
00:33:15,723 --> 00:33:17,066
Trip aces.

177
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:19,268
Aces win.

178
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:24,104
Oh, and the valet ticket.

179
00:33:28,269 --> 00:33:29,643
Thank you.

180
00:33:29,837 --> 00:33:31,244
Sir.

181
00:34:02,095 --> 00:34:04,332
-Thank you.
-Thank you, sir.

182
00:34:05,327 --> 00:34:08,361
No wonder he was
in such a foul mood.

183
00:34:09,551 --> 00:34:10,696
My mistake.

184
00:34:10,894 --> 00:34:12,105
Can I give you a lift home?

185
00:34:12,751 --> 00:34:15,981
That would really send him
over the edge.

186
00:34:16,176 --> 00:34:18,030
I’m afraid I’m not that cruel.

187
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,230
Well, perhaps you’re just
out of practice.

188
00:34:27,696 --> 00:34:28,940
Perhaps.

189
00:34:29,136 --> 00:34:30,794
Well, what about
a drink at my place?

190
00:34:31,664 --> 00:34:33,573
Your place?

191
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,717
-Is it close?
-Very.

192
00:34:42,866 --> 00:34:44,654
One drink.

193
00:35:08,947 --> 00:35:10,474
Good evening, sir,
and welcome back.

194
00:35:10,674 --> 00:35:12,497
Welcome to my home.

195
00:35:24,244 --> 00:35:27,179
I’m having a hard time seeing
how this is my fault.

196
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:29,933
It’s your plan.
All I did was get you the man.

197
00:35:30,132 --> 00:35:34,442
A man who was under surveillance
by the British Secret Service.

198
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:38,548
Which makes me wonder
if I can trust you at all.

199
00:35:38,836 --> 00:35:41,203
Then don’t. I couldn’t care less.

200
00:35:41,396 --> 00:35:43,284
But I do care about my reputation.

201
00:35:44,213 --> 00:35:46,352
I have someone else
willing to do the job.

202
00:35:46,548 --> 00:35:48,272
He just needs the particulars…

203
00:35:49,077 --> 00:35:50,768
…and payment.

204
00:36:01,334 --> 00:36:04,782
You like married women,
don’t you, James?

205
00:36:04,982 --> 00:36:07,087
It keeps things simple.

206
00:36:09,910 --> 00:36:12,594
What is it about bad men?

207
00:36:12,790 --> 00:36:15,638
You, my husband….

208
00:36:15,831 --> 00:36:18,384
I had so many chances
to be happy…

209
00:36:18,583 --> 00:36:20,851
…so many nice guys.

210
00:36:21,048 --> 00:36:23,634
Why can’t nice guys
be more like you?

211
00:36:23,832 --> 00:36:25,970
Well, because then they’d be bad.

212
00:36:26,871 --> 00:36:29,043
Yes.

213
00:36:31,672 --> 00:36:34,389
But so much more interesting.

214
00:36:38,647 --> 00:36:40,982
What makes your husband
a bad man?

215
00:36:41,176 --> 00:36:43,631
His nature, I suppose.

216
00:36:43,832 --> 00:36:45,426
The nature of his work?

217
00:36:45,624 --> 00:36:49,137
A mystery, I’m afraid.

218
00:36:49,785 --> 00:36:54,870
I’m also afraid you will sleep with me
in order to get to him.

219
00:36:55,065 --> 00:36:57,432
How afraid?

220
00:36:57,978 --> 00:37:00,661
Not enough to stop.

221
00:37:07,930 --> 00:37:10,002
Can I ask you a personal question?

222
00:37:11,610 --> 00:37:15,123
Now would seem
an appropriate time.

223
00:37:15,322 --> 00:37:17,592
Does “ellipsis”
mean anything to you?

224
00:37:26,555 --> 00:37:28,442
Should I ask him about it?

225
00:37:28,635 --> 00:37:30,871
Perhaps later.

226
00:37:31,803 --> 00:37:32,915
Yes, dear?

227
00:37:33,115 --> 00:37:34,937
I’m on the last flight
tonight to Miami.

228
00:37:35,132 --> 00:37:37,652
Don’t wait up.
I’ll be back in the morning.

229
00:37:37,852 --> 00:37:40,089
Okay, I understand.

230
00:37:40,284 --> 00:37:42,935
See you tomorrow. Bye-bye.

231
00:37:44,413 --> 00:37:48,635
Apparently he’s on
the last flight to Miami…

232
00:37:48,828 --> 00:37:52,822
…so you have all night
to question me.

233
00:37:55,548 --> 00:37:56,955
In that case…

234
00:37:57,149 --> 00:37:58,229
…we’re gonna need…

235
00:37:58,428 --> 00:38:00,698
…some more champagne.

236
00:38:06,365 --> 00:38:07,707
Good evening. Room service.

237
00:38:07,902 --> 00:38:11,546
Good evening. Can I get a bottle
of chilled Bollinger Grand Année…

238
00:38:11,742 --> 00:38:12,920
…and the beluga caviar?

239
00:38:13,118 --> 00:38:15,485
-With everything?
-Yes, with everything.

240
00:38:15,678 --> 00:38:17,685
-And would that be for two, sir?
-What?

241
00:38:17,885 --> 00:38:21,017
-For two?
-No, for one.

242
00:38:52,768 --> 00:38:54,427
Wait here.

243
00:38:58,337 --> 00:39:01,370
There you go. Number 53.

244
00:39:05,185 --> 00:39:07,454
Dr. von Hagens’ Body Worlds
invites visitors…

245
00:39:07,650 --> 00:39:10,367
…to observe the body’s various
locomotive, digestive…

246
00:39:10,561 --> 00:39:12,252
…nervous and vascular systems.

247
00:40:10,373 --> 00:40:13,634
Please may I have your attention,
ladies and gentlemen?

248
00:40:15,206 --> 00:40:18,337
I believe it is something very special,
what we see here.

249
00:40:18,534 --> 00:40:19,646
This is edutainment.

250
00:40:44,935 --> 00:40:47,007
--fixed in dramatic
and athletic poses…

251
00:40:47,239 --> 00:40:50,916
… that reveal the true-to-life spatial
relationships amongst organs.

252
00:41:04,488 --> 00:41:05,949
Hello.

253
00:41:06,152 --> 00:41:07,974
Hello.

254
00:41:17,257 --> 00:41:19,646
Do not leave your vehicle unattended.

255
00:41:19,848 --> 00:41:22,304
Welcome to Miami
International Airport.

256
00:41:22,506 --> 00:41:25,506
Curbside parking in front
of the terminal is restricted.

257
00:42:56,623 --> 00:42:59,492
-Yes.
-It’s Bond. I need her now.

258
00:42:59,695 --> 00:43:02,313
I’m afraid she can’t be disturbed.
Can I take a message?

259
00:43:02,511 --> 00:43:05,643
Listen, you go and find her, tell her
to call Security at Miami Airport…

260
00:43:05,839 --> 00:43:08,295
…because I think a bomb is about
to go off. Do it now.

261
00:43:08,751 --> 00:43:11,304
-Sorry, can I put you on hold?
-I thought you might.

262
00:43:15,568 --> 00:43:18,186
Bond? What the hell are you up to?

263
00:43:20,912 --> 00:43:21,860
I’ll call you back.

264
00:43:43,730 --> 00:43:45,967
-The Skyfleet S570 prototype.
-What about it?

265
00:43:46,162 --> 00:43:49,261
“The largest airplane in the world will
be unveiled today at Miami Airport.”

266
00:44:28,980 --> 00:44:29,962
Oh, my God

267
00:44:30,165 --> 00:44:31,691
Bond? Bond!

268
00:44:34,580 --> 00:44:36,587
His target is the Skyfleet prototype.

269
00:44:36,789 --> 00:44:38,644
It’s launching today.

270
00:44:41,557 --> 00:44:42,670
I gotta go.

271
00:48:57,156 --> 00:48:58,815
Stop!. Stop!.

272
00:49:59,016 --> 00:50:00,805
Get moving!
Let’s go, let’s go, let’s go!

273
00:51:30,125 --> 00:51:34,698
The puts expired. I’m sorry,
I’m not sure yet how much you’ve lost.

274
00:51:34,893 --> 00:51:40,076
One hundred and one million,
two hundred and six thousand dollars.

275
00:51:46,349 --> 00:51:48,422
Someone talked.

276
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:13,102
-You got everything you need?
-Yeah, I have.

277
00:52:13,296 --> 00:52:15,271
I’m gonna get a few more photos….

278
00:52:29,073 --> 00:52:31,975
Quite the body count
you’re stacking up.

279
00:52:32,753 --> 00:52:35,371
She was tortured first.
As you’d already killed her husband…

280
00:52:35,568 --> 00:52:38,089
…she must have been
the only one left to question.

281
00:52:38,770 --> 00:52:40,776
Did she know anything
that could compromise you?

282
00:52:40,977 --> 00:52:41,905
No.

283
00:52:42,097 --> 00:52:45,414
-Not your name, what you were after?
-No.

284
00:52:45,618 --> 00:52:46,993
Dimitrios worked as a middleman.

285
00:52:47,187 --> 00:52:48,878
Knew where to put his hands
on weapons…

286
00:52:49,074 --> 00:52:50,448
…and people who could use them.

287
00:52:50,642 --> 00:52:52,203
He worked with anyone
who had money.

288
00:52:52,402 --> 00:52:55,631
For years he was involved with a man
we knew as Le Chiffre…

289
00:52:55,827 --> 00:52:57,649
…a private banker
to the world’s terrorists.

290
00:52:57,843 --> 00:53:01,159
He invested their money, gave them
access to it wherever they wanted.

291
00:53:01,362 --> 00:53:03,054
Oh, good. You’re here.

292
00:53:03,251 --> 00:53:05,707
Albanian, we believe.
Chess prodigy.

293
00:53:05,907 --> 00:53:10,283
A bit of a mathematical genius
and liked to prove it by playing poker.

294
00:53:38,358 --> 00:53:39,786
So you can keep an eye on me?

295
00:53:41,078 --> 00:53:42,506
Yes.

296
00:53:47,221 --> 00:53:50,221
When they analyzed
the stock market after 9/11…

297
00:53:50,421 --> 00:53:53,585
…the CIA discovered a massive
shorting of airline stocks.

298
00:53:54,391 --> 00:53:57,457
When the stocks hit bottom on 9/12,
somebody made a fortune.

299
00:53:58,134 --> 00:54:00,589
The same thing happened
this morning with Skyfleet stock…

300
00:54:00,790 --> 00:54:01,969
…or was supposed to.

301
00:54:02,167 --> 00:54:05,779
With their prototype destroyed, the
company would be near bankruptcy.

302
00:54:05,974 --> 00:54:09,837
Instead, somebody lost over
$100 million betting the wrong way.

303
00:54:10,807 --> 00:54:12,630
You think it’s this man Le Chiffre.

304
00:54:12,823 --> 00:54:15,638
Which would explain how he could
set up a high-stakes poker game…

305
00:54:15,831 --> 00:54:17,457
…at Casino Royale in Montenegro.

306
00:54:17,656 --> 00:54:21,550
Ten players, $10 million buy-in,
5 million re-buy.

307
00:54:21,751 --> 00:54:24,402
Winner takes all.
Potentially 150 million.

308
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:27,055
Good.
Then we’ll know where he’ll be.

309
00:54:27,255 --> 00:54:29,143
Do you want a clean kill
or to send a message?

310
00:54:29,336 --> 00:54:33,428
We want him alive. Le Chiffre
doesn’t have 100 million to lose.

311
00:54:33,624 --> 00:54:36,886
Has he been playing the stock market
with his clients’ funds?

312
00:54:37,081 --> 00:54:39,798
They’re not gonna be too happy
when they find out it’s gone.

313
00:54:39,992 --> 00:54:41,302
We can’t let him win this game.

314
00:54:41,497 --> 00:54:43,636
If he loses,
he’ll have nowhere to run.

315
00:54:43,833 --> 00:54:46,550
We’ll give him sanctuary
in return for everything he knows.

316
00:54:46,745 --> 00:54:48,403
I’m putting you in the game…

317
00:54:48,602 --> 00:54:51,155
…replacing someone
who’s playing for a syndicate.

318
00:54:51,354 --> 00:54:54,769
According to Villiers,
you’re the best player in the Service.

319
00:54:55,162 --> 00:54:56,918
Trust me, I wish it wasn’t the case.

320
00:55:01,370 --> 00:55:05,527
I would ask you if you could remain
emotionally detached…

321
00:55:05,722 --> 00:55:08,756
…but I don’t think
that’s your problem, is it, Bond?

322
00:55:09,434 --> 00:55:11,190
No.

323
00:55:13,178 --> 00:55:14,739
Don’t worry about keeping in touch.

324
00:55:15,931 --> 00:55:17,175
We’ll know where you are.

325
00:55:17,371 --> 00:55:18,680
You can stop pretending.

326
00:55:19,515 --> 00:55:21,457
You knew I wouldn’t let this drop,
didn’t you?

327
00:55:22,587 --> 00:55:24,792
Well, I knew you were you.

328
00:55:42,588 --> 00:55:44,214
Thank you.

329
00:55:50,941 --> 00:55:52,250
I’m the money.

330
00:55:54,461 --> 00:55:55,671
Every penny of it.

331
00:55:58,013 --> 00:56:00,021
The Treasury has agreed
to stake you in the game.

332
00:56:01,342 --> 00:56:02,934
“Vesper.”

333
00:56:03,134 --> 00:56:05,523
Well, I do hope you gave
your parents hell for that.

334
00:56:06,270 --> 00:56:07,645
Thank you.

335
00:56:07,838 --> 00:56:09,432
Your boss must be well-connected.

336
00:56:09,630 --> 00:56:11,965
I’ve never seen so much
go out the door so quickly.

337
00:56:12,542 --> 00:56:14,102
Or quite so stylishly.

338
00:56:16,126 --> 00:56:17,501
May I ask you where it is?

339
00:56:17,694 --> 00:56:20,116
Ten million was wired
to your account in Montenegro…

340
00:56:20,319 --> 00:56:24,475
…with a contingency for 5 more
if I deem it a prudent investment.

341
00:56:24,671 --> 00:56:27,573
I suppose you’ve given some thought
to the notion that if you lose…

342
00:56:27,775 --> 00:56:30,558
…our government
will have directly financed terrorism.

343
00:56:33,792 --> 00:56:35,134
What looks good?

344
00:56:42,080 --> 00:56:44,763
So you’re telling me it’s a matter
of probability and odds.

345
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:46,848
I was worried there was
some chance involved.

346
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:49,594
Well, only if you assume the player
with the best hand wins.

347
00:56:50,112 --> 00:56:51,935
So that would be
what you call “bluffing”?

348
00:56:54,881 --> 00:56:56,605
You’ve heard the term.

349
00:56:56,801 --> 00:56:59,191
Then you’ll also know that in poker
you never play your hand.

350
00:56:59,393 --> 00:57:00,702
You play the man across from you.

351
00:57:00,896 --> 00:57:03,166
-And you’re good at reading people?
-Yes, I am.

352
00:57:03,361 --> 00:57:04,987
Which is why
I’ve been able to detect…

353
00:57:05,186 --> 00:57:07,226
…an undercurrent
of sarcasm in your voice.

354
00:57:07,906 --> 00:57:10,655
I’m now assured our money
is in good hands.

355
00:57:11,682 --> 00:57:13,787
You don’t think
this is a very good plan, do you?

356
00:57:13,986 --> 00:57:15,414
So there is a plan?

357
00:57:15,618 --> 00:57:18,073
I got the impression
we were risking millions of dollars…

358
00:57:18,274 --> 00:57:20,413
…and hundreds of lives
on a game of luck.

359
00:57:20,610 --> 00:57:22,552
What else can you surmise,
Mr. Bond?

360
00:57:22,755 --> 00:57:24,827
About you, Miss Lynd?

361
00:57:25,027 --> 00:57:26,553
Well, your beauty’s a problem.

362
00:57:27,011 --> 00:57:28,920
You worry you won’t
be taken seriously.

363
00:57:29,123 --> 00:57:31,992
Which one can say of any
attractive woman with half a brain.

364
00:57:32,195 --> 00:57:33,689
True, but this one
overcompensates…

365
00:57:33,890 --> 00:57:35,647
…by wearing
slightly masculine clothing…

366
00:57:35,843 --> 00:57:38,113
…being more aggressive
than her female colleagues…

367
00:57:38,307 --> 00:57:40,674
…which gives her a somewhat
prickly demeanor…

368
00:57:40,867 --> 00:57:44,064
…and ironically enough, makes it
less likely for her to be accepted…

369
00:57:44,259 --> 00:57:46,365
…and promoted
by her male superiors…

370
00:57:46,564 --> 00:57:49,215
…who mistake her insecurities
for arrogance.

371
00:57:49,700 --> 00:57:53,563
Now, I’d have normally
gone with only child…

372
00:57:53,764 --> 00:57:56,732
…but, you see, by the way you ignored
the quip about your parents…

373
00:57:56,932 --> 00:57:59,485
…I’m gonna have to go with orphan.

374
00:58:02,340 --> 00:58:04,195
All right.

375
00:58:05,029 --> 00:58:07,484
By the cut of your suit,
you went to Oxford or wherever…

376
00:58:07,685 --> 00:58:09,955
…and actually think
human beings dress like that.

377
00:58:10,149 --> 00:58:11,972
But you wear it with such disdain…

378
00:58:12,165 --> 00:58:13,988
…my guess is
you didn’t come from money…

379
00:58:14,182 --> 00:58:16,637
…and your school friends
never let you forget it.

380
00:58:16,838 --> 00:58:18,693
Which means you were
at that school by the grace…

381
00:58:18,885 --> 00:58:21,636
…of someone else’s charity,
hence the chip on your shoulder.

382
00:58:21,831 --> 00:58:24,220
And since your first thought about me
ran to orphan…

383
00:58:24,422 --> 00:58:26,331
…that’s what I’d say you are.

384
00:58:30,119 --> 00:58:32,029
Oh, you are.

385
00:58:32,487 --> 00:58:34,242
I like this poker thing.

386
00:58:34,438 --> 00:58:36,129
And that makes perfect sense…

387
00:58:36,327 --> 00:58:38,629
…since MI-6 looks
for maladjusted young men…

388
00:58:38,822 --> 00:58:40,994
…that give little thought
to sacrificing others…

389
00:58:41,191 --> 00:58:43,297
…in order to protect
Queen and country.

390
00:58:43,495 --> 00:58:44,542
You know…

391
00:58:44,743 --> 00:58:48,518
…former SAS types with easy smiles
and expensive watches.

392
00:58:48,999 --> 00:58:51,269
-Rolex?
-Omega.

393
00:58:51,463 --> 00:58:53,220
Beautiful.

394
00:58:53,704 --> 00:58:55,296
Now, having just met you…

395
00:58:55,496 --> 00:58:58,213
…I wouldn’t go as far as calling you
a cold-hearted bastard.

396
00:58:58,409 --> 00:58:59,717
No, of course not.

397
00:58:59,912 --> 00:59:01,538
But it wouldn’t be a stretch
to imagine.

398
00:59:01,736 --> 00:59:03,809
You think of women
as disposable pleasures…

399
00:59:04,009 --> 00:59:06,016
…rather than meaningful pursuits.

400
00:59:07,432 --> 00:59:09,472
So as charming as you are,
Mr. Bond…

401
00:59:09,673 --> 00:59:12,007
…I will be keeping my eye
on our government’s money…

402
00:59:12,201 --> 00:59:14,089
…and off your perfectly formed arse.

403
00:59:14,538 --> 00:59:15,999
You noticed?

404
00:59:16,202 --> 00:59:18,111
Even accountants have imagination.

405
00:59:18,313 --> 00:59:19,590
How was your lamb?

406
00:59:19,977 --> 00:59:21,472
Skewered.

407
00:59:21,673 --> 00:59:23,233
One sympathizes.

408
00:59:25,002 --> 00:59:26,431
Good evening, Mr. Bond.

409
00:59:26,634 --> 00:59:28,870
Good evening, Miss Lynd.

410
00:59:43,754 --> 00:59:46,602
-Hotel Splendid, sir?
-That’s right.

411
00:59:48,779 --> 00:59:50,918
-Thank you, sir.
-Thank you.

412
01:00:03,884 --> 01:00:06,568
It’s just last-minute details.

413
01:00:08,205 --> 01:00:09,863
Apparently we’re very much in love.

414
01:00:10,572 --> 01:00:13,421
Do you usually leave it to porters
to tell you this sort of thing?

415
01:00:13,613 --> 01:00:16,199
Only when the romance
has been necessarily brief.

416
01:00:16,589 --> 01:00:19,437
I’m Mr. Arlington Beech,
professional gambler…

417
01:00:19,629 --> 01:00:21,122
…and you’re
Miss Stephanie Broadchest –

418
01:00:21,326 --> 01:00:23,430
-I am not.
-You’re gonna have to trust me on this.

419
01:00:23,628 --> 01:00:25,516
Oh, no, I don’t.

420
01:00:25,709 --> 01:00:27,532
We’ve been involved
for quite a while…

421
01:00:28,266 --> 01:00:29,957
…hence the shared suite.

422
01:00:30,155 --> 01:00:32,424
But my family
is strict Roman Catholic…

423
01:00:32,619 --> 01:00:35,237
…so for appearances’ sake,
it’ll be a two-bedroom suite.

424
01:00:35,434 --> 01:00:38,566
I do hate it when religion
comes between us.

425
01:00:38,858 --> 01:00:41,160
Religion and a securely locked door.

426
01:00:41,355 --> 01:00:43,242
Am I going to have a problem
with you, Bond?

427
01:00:43,435 --> 01:00:46,086
No, don’t worry. You’re not my type.

428
01:00:46,315 --> 01:00:47,363
Smart?

429
01:00:47,948 --> 01:00:49,573
Single.

430
01:01:08,013 --> 01:01:09,921
Welcome to the Hotel Splendid.
Your name, sir?

431
01:01:10,125 --> 01:01:12,874
James Bond. You’ll find
the reservation under Beech.

432
01:01:13,068 --> 01:01:15,686
-Welcome, Mr. Bond.
-You sign that, dear.

433
01:01:16,301 --> 01:01:18,538
You represent the Treasury.

434
01:01:22,702 --> 01:01:25,255
Thank you. Enjoy your stay.

435
01:01:25,453 --> 01:01:26,980
I will. Thank you.

436
01:01:29,870 --> 01:01:30,982
Very funny.

437
01:01:31,182 --> 01:01:33,069
Look, if Le Chiffre
is that well-connected…

438
01:01:33,262 --> 01:01:35,085
…he knows who I am
and where the money’s from.

439
01:01:35,438 --> 01:01:37,577
Which means he’s decided
to play me anyway.

440
01:01:37,774 --> 01:01:40,043
So he’s either desperate
or he’s overly confident…

441
01:01:40,239 --> 01:01:42,443
…but either way, that tells me
something about him.

442
01:01:42,639 --> 01:01:45,060
And all he gets in return
is a name he already has.

443
01:01:45,359 --> 01:01:46,918
And now he knows
something about you.

444
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:49,224
He knows you’re reckless.

445
01:01:49,807 --> 01:01:51,563
Take the next one.

446
01:01:51,759 --> 01:01:54,509
There isn’t enough room for me
and your ego.

447
01:01:54,896 --> 01:01:56,390
Mr. Bond?

448
01:01:56,591 --> 01:01:58,828
-It was left for you.
-Thank you.

449
01:02:28,690 --> 01:02:30,151
I love you too, M.

450
01:03:07,732 --> 01:03:12,717
My name is Mathis. Rene Mathis.
I’m your contact here.

451
01:03:16,085 --> 01:03:17,578
Does he know
we’ve been watching him?

452
01:03:17,780 --> 01:03:20,333
Le Chiffre? I don’t think so.

453
01:03:20,533 --> 01:03:24,689
Probably because there’s no “we.”
Just me.

454
01:03:25,300 --> 01:03:27,188
I’m afraid if you get
into trouble here…

455
01:03:27,380 --> 01:03:30,959
…the cavalry won’t be
coming over the nearest hill.

456
01:03:32,437 --> 01:03:34,161
Le Chiffre arrived yesterday…

457
01:03:34,582 --> 01:03:37,964
…and spent the time reestablishing
old relationships.

458
01:03:38,549 --> 01:03:41,365
The chief of police and he
are now quite close.

459
01:03:41,558 --> 01:03:43,380
That’s him, with the mustache.

460
01:03:43,574 --> 01:03:45,068
Over my left shoulder.

461
01:03:46,102 --> 01:03:48,207
Well, that could make life
quite difficult.

462
01:03:48,406 --> 01:03:50,294
Yeah, and quite possibly shorter.

463
01:03:50,486 --> 01:03:53,007
He’s not a very subtle man.

464
01:03:53,206 --> 01:03:56,240
I thought about trying to buy
his services, but we frankly…

465
01:03:56,438 --> 01:03:59,504
…couldn’t afford to outbid Le Chiffre.

466
01:04:07,287 --> 01:04:08,400
I hate to say it…

467
01:04:08,600 --> 01:04:12,396
…but the accountants seem
to be running MI6 these days.

468
01:04:13,432 --> 01:04:16,498
Oh, not that I have anything
against accountants.

469
01:04:16,695 --> 01:04:18,867
Many of them are lovely people.

470
01:04:20,344 --> 01:04:23,312
So I decided that it was cheaper
to supply his deputy…

471
01:04:23,512 --> 01:04:26,960
…with evidence
that we were bribing the chief.

472
01:04:27,160 --> 01:04:31,317
It’s amazing what you can do with
Photoshop these days, isn’t it?

473
01:04:34,137 --> 01:04:36,657
I think your odds are improving,
Mr. Bond.

474
01:04:41,913 --> 01:04:43,222
Yes?

475
01:04:43,866 --> 01:04:45,459
For you.

476
01:04:46,586 --> 01:04:48,975
Something you expect me to wear?

477
01:04:51,353 --> 01:04:52,630
I need you looking fabulous.

478
01:04:52,826 --> 01:04:55,030
So when you walk up behind me
and kiss me on the neck…

479
01:04:55,226 --> 01:04:57,496
…the players will be thinking
about your neckline…

480
01:04:57,690 --> 01:04:59,349
…and not about their cards.

481
01:04:59,547 --> 01:05:01,848
Do you think you can
do that for me?

482
01:05:02,043 --> 01:05:03,897
I’ll do my best.

483
01:05:04,923 --> 01:05:06,777
Thank you.

484
01:05:18,300 --> 01:05:19,477
I have a dinner jacket.

485
01:05:20,636 --> 01:05:22,873
There are dinner jackets
and dinner jackets.

486
01:05:23,068 --> 01:05:24,180
This is the latter.

487
01:05:24,380 --> 01:05:27,446
And I need you looking like a man
who belongs at that table.

488
01:05:27,868 --> 01:05:29,429
How--?

489
01:05:30,204 --> 01:05:31,612
It’s tailored.

490
01:05:31,804 --> 01:05:34,260
I sized you up the moment we met.

491
01:06:25,760 --> 01:06:28,280
-Good evening, sir.
-Good evening.

492
01:06:30,143 --> 01:06:31,737
Thank you.

493
01:06:42,080 --> 01:06:44,121
And you must be
Mr. Bliss’ replacement.

494
01:06:44,321 --> 01:06:46,329
Welcome, Mr. Beech.

495
01:06:47,489 --> 01:06:50,172
Or is that Bond?
I’m a little confused.

496
01:06:50,369 --> 01:06:52,703
Well, we wouldn’t want that,
would we?

497
01:07:01,762 --> 01:07:03,671
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome.

498
01:07:03,874 --> 01:07:06,362
As you know, the game is no-limit
hold ’em poker.

499
01:07:06,562 --> 01:07:08,417
Five communal cards,
two in the hole.

500
01:07:08,866 --> 01:07:11,517
Monsieur Mendel here represents
the Basel Bank, Switzerland…

501
01:07:11,714 --> 01:07:12,893
…holding the stakes.

502
01:07:15,107 --> 01:07:17,529
You have each deposited
$10 million buy-in.

503
01:07:17,731 --> 01:07:20,514
A further buy-in of 5 million
can be made by electronic transfer.

504
01:07:20,707 --> 01:07:22,715
The money will remain in escrow
until I return…

505
01:07:22,915 --> 01:07:25,534
…and the winner of the contest
enters his or her password…

506
01:07:25,731 --> 01:07:26,843
…into the encryptor…

507
01:07:27,043 --> 01:07:28,701
…whereupon the entire sum
will be wired…

508
01:07:28,900 --> 01:07:30,940
…to any bank account
in the world you nominate.

509
01:07:31,491 --> 01:07:33,150
Mr. Bond?

510
01:07:33,572 --> 01:07:34,684
We proceed alphabetically.

511
01:07:34,883 --> 01:07:37,218
Please be so kind as to enter
a password of your choice.

512
01:07:45,284 --> 01:07:46,397
Six letters or more.

513
01:07:58,950 --> 01:08:01,503
High card for dealer position.

514
01:08:08,262 --> 01:08:09,506
It’s Signor Gallardo.

515
01:08:09,702 --> 01:08:12,604
Mr. Kaminofsky is
the small blind, $5000…

516
01:08:12,806 --> 01:08:16,123
…and Mr. Fukutu, the big blind,
$10,000.

517
01:08:18,150 --> 01:08:20,093
Well, enjoy the game.

518
01:08:42,984 --> 01:08:44,031
Four players.

519
01:08:46,536 --> 01:08:47,812
It’s your bet.

520
01:08:49,289 --> 01:08:50,696
Check.

521
01:08:50,889 --> 01:08:52,612
Check.

522
01:08:56,745 --> 01:08:58,720
Bet. Fifty thousand.

523
01:09:11,401 --> 01:09:12,612
Call.

524
01:09:15,754 --> 01:09:16,965
Fold.

525
01:09:19,082 --> 01:09:21,383
Fold. Heads up.

526
01:09:25,515 --> 01:09:26,889
Monsieur Le Chiffre.

527
01:09:37,931 --> 01:09:40,387
Bet. One hundred thousand.

528
01:09:43,371 --> 01:09:46,241
Weren’t you supposed to enter
so the others could see you?

529
01:09:46,443 --> 01:09:49,345
Was I? Forgive me.

530
01:09:49,868 --> 01:09:51,973
Good luck, darling.

531
01:09:55,628 --> 01:09:57,930
It’s up to you, Monsieur Bond.

532
01:09:59,821 --> 01:10:00,966
Monsieur Bond?

533
01:10:01,165 --> 01:10:03,718
Oh, I’m sorry. What was the bet?
A hundred thousand?

534
01:10:04,492 --> 01:10:06,151
Call.

535
01:10:11,085 --> 01:10:12,198
Hello.

536
01:10:12,397 --> 01:10:15,845
I suppose I don’t have to tell you
how beautiful you look.

537
01:10:16,045 --> 01:10:19,045
Half the people at that table
are still watching you.

538
01:10:19,246 --> 01:10:20,173
Champagne.

539
01:10:23,726 --> 01:10:25,515
Monsieur Le Chiffre.

540
01:10:36,143 --> 01:10:37,387
Bet. Two hundred thousand.

541
01:10:43,535 --> 01:10:47,147
Monsieur, you have been called.
Showdown, please.

542
01:10:48,751 --> 01:10:51,784
A full house to Monsieur Le Chiffre.
Deuces full of nines.

543
01:10:51,983 --> 01:10:53,707
Mr. Bond?

544
01:10:56,496 --> 01:10:57,772
Fold.

545
01:11:04,848 --> 01:11:07,085
Send the barman over, please.

546
01:11:14,897 --> 01:11:17,580
A dry martini. Wait.

547
01:11:17,777 --> 01:11:19,403
Three measures Gordon’s,
one of vodka…

548
01:11:19,601 --> 01:11:21,357
…half of Kina Lillet,
shake it over ice…

549
01:11:21,553 --> 01:11:24,271
-…then add a thin slice of lemon peel.
-Yes, sir.

550
01:11:24,466 --> 01:11:27,216
-You know, I’ll have one of those.
-So will I.

551
01:11:28,146 --> 01:11:29,324
Certainly.

552
01:11:30,226 --> 01:11:33,968
My friend, bring me one as well.
Keep the fruit.

553
01:11:34,802 --> 01:11:36,078
That’s it?

554
01:11:37,331 --> 01:11:38,857
Anyone want to play poker now?

555
01:11:39,058 --> 01:11:40,171
Someone’s in a hurry.

556
01:11:48,819 --> 01:11:50,674
Would you excuse me?

557
01:12:03,636 --> 01:12:04,912
You taste nice.

558
01:12:05,107 --> 01:12:07,922
-I thought we dispensed with covers.
-No.

559
01:12:08,116 --> 01:12:11,662
We dispensed with one that was
of no use and created another that is.

560
01:12:11,861 --> 01:12:13,322
-Is he watching?
-Yes.

561
01:12:13,525 --> 01:12:14,539
Good.

562
01:12:14,741 --> 01:12:17,392
This is me in character pissed off
because you’re losing so fast…

563
01:12:17,588 --> 01:12:19,279
…we won’t be here past midnight.

564
01:12:19,477 --> 01:12:22,324
Oddly, my character’s feelings
mirror my own.

565
01:12:22,932 --> 01:12:24,427
Check.

566
01:12:25,045 --> 01:12:26,802
-You know, that’s not half bad.
-Up to you.

567
01:12:26,997 --> 01:12:28,819
I’m gonna have to think up
a name for that.

568
01:12:30,294 --> 01:12:32,749
It was worth it to discover his tell.

569
01:12:33,078 --> 01:12:34,289
What do you mean?

570
01:12:34,646 --> 01:12:36,588
The twitch he has to hide
when he bluffs.

571
01:12:36,789 --> 01:12:40,751
-Bluffs? He had the best hand.
-Which he got on the last card.

572
01:12:40,950 --> 01:12:43,055
The odds against were 23-to-1,
and he’d know that.

573
01:12:43,254 --> 01:12:45,142
When he did his first raise
he had nothing.

574
01:12:45,334 --> 01:12:46,795
Winning was blind luck.

575
01:12:46,998 --> 01:12:48,754
-Did you get the bug?
-Yes.

576
01:12:48,951 --> 01:12:50,740
Bet. One hundred thousand.

577
01:12:50,934 --> 01:12:52,395
Thank you.

578
01:12:54,135 --> 01:12:55,509
It’s your play, Monsieur Fukutu.

579
01:12:55,703 --> 01:12:58,605
Maybe he can actually pull this off.

580
01:12:59,414 --> 01:13:00,789
Call.

581
01:13:02,327 --> 01:13:04,215
Monsieur Le Chiffre.

582
01:13:06,647 --> 01:13:09,069
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mesdames, Messieurs…

583
01:13:09,271 --> 01:13:10,963
…we’ve now been
playing for four hours.

584
01:13:11,160 --> 01:13:15,437
It’s time for a short break.
We will resume play in one hour.

585
01:13:43,098 --> 01:13:48,630
Well, I think I’ll report
on the evening’s frivolities.

586
01:13:50,170 --> 01:13:51,958
So?

587
01:13:52,154 --> 01:13:54,194
You want to do what to me?

588
01:13:54,394 --> 01:13:55,671
You’ve lost me completely.

589
01:13:55,866 --> 01:13:58,681
You just said you can’t wait
to get me back to the room. Come on.

590
01:14:21,660 --> 01:14:25,141
So, what’s so damn important?

591
01:14:27,485 --> 01:14:29,012
I’m sorry.

592
01:14:31,773 --> 01:14:33,267
Where is my money?

593
01:14:37,629 --> 01:14:38,774
-Good evening.
-Good evening.

594
01:14:38,972 --> 01:14:41,111
You’re holding a parcel for me.

595
01:14:45,566 --> 01:14:47,159
Thank you.

596
01:14:48,382 --> 01:14:52,376
Do you think you can lose that kind
of money and no one would notice?

597
01:14:52,894 --> 01:14:54,617
Your money is safe.

598
01:14:56,350 --> 01:14:58,008
Open that.

599
01:15:13,375 --> 01:15:15,349
You’ll have it tomorrow.

600
01:15:16,255 --> 01:15:17,499
All of it.

601
01:15:30,432 --> 01:15:34,230
I would take a hand for this betrayal,
but you need it to play cards.

602
01:15:38,592 --> 01:15:40,251
Hold out your arm.

603
01:15:41,473 --> 01:15:43,196
Hold out your arm, my beauty…

604
01:15:43,808 --> 01:15:45,336
…or I will take your head.

605
01:15:54,850 --> 01:15:57,665
Go to the room. Wait for me there.

606
01:16:10,466 --> 01:16:11,393
Stairs.

607
01:16:15,715 --> 01:16:18,236
Not a word of protest.

608
01:16:18,819 --> 01:16:21,274
You should find a new boyfriend.

609
01:18:18,442 --> 01:18:20,068
Go find Mathis.

610
01:18:20,267 --> 01:18:23,366
Tell him I’ve hidden the bodies here
and I want him to get rid of them.

611
01:18:23,562 --> 01:18:26,464
Do that now. Go. Go, go!

612
01:19:26,734 --> 01:19:29,222
You changed your shirt, Mr. Bond.

613
01:19:29,551 --> 01:19:33,097
I hope our little game
isn’t causing you to perspire.

614
01:19:33,294 --> 01:19:34,472
A little.

615
01:19:34,670 --> 01:19:38,086
But I won’t consider myself to be
in trouble until I start weeping blood.

616
01:19:38,288 --> 01:19:42,149
Ladies and gentlemen, if everybody’s
ready, let’s continue the game.

617
01:20:40,883 --> 01:20:45,073
It’s like there’s blood on my hands.
It’s not coming off.

618
01:20:46,067 --> 01:20:47,855
Here, let’s see.

619
01:21:02,804 --> 01:21:04,560
That’s better.

620
01:21:08,468 --> 01:21:09,745
You cold?

621
01:21:09,941 --> 01:21:11,282
Yeah.

622
01:21:11,476 --> 01:21:13,298
Here.

623
01:22:07,704 --> 01:22:09,876
You have any trouble
with the bodies?

624
01:22:10,232 --> 01:22:12,273
Less than some.

625
01:22:25,497 --> 01:22:29,075
Being dead doesn’t mean
one can’t still be helpful.

626
01:22:29,978 --> 01:22:32,563
That’ll keep Le Chiffre
looking over his shoulder.

627
01:22:32,762 --> 01:22:34,901
He’ll be wondering who’s gonna
come for him next.

628
01:22:36,473 --> 01:22:38,612
How’s our girl?

629
01:22:39,130 --> 01:22:42,196
Melted your cold heart yet?

630
01:22:59,387 --> 01:23:00,532
Call.

631
01:23:00,730 --> 01:23:02,073
Fold.

632
01:23:02,267 --> 01:23:04,155
And call.

633
01:23:05,403 --> 01:23:07,378
Three players.

634
01:23:10,843 --> 01:23:12,534
Three hundred grand.

635
01:23:12,732 --> 01:23:14,325
Bet. Three hundred thousand.

636
01:23:16,124 --> 01:23:17,717
Call.

637
01:23:19,389 --> 01:23:20,316
And call.

638
01:23:25,276 --> 01:23:26,520
Three players.

639
01:23:30,684 --> 01:23:31,633
Check.

640
01:23:36,925 --> 01:23:38,038
Monsieur Bond?

641
01:23:47,517 --> 01:23:49,852
Bet. Five hundred thousand.

642
01:24:01,055 --> 01:24:05,178
Look. It’s the tell. He is bluffing.

643
01:24:05,375 --> 01:24:07,317
My God, James was right.

644
01:24:08,382 --> 01:24:10,237
It’s up to you.

645
01:24:16,127 --> 01:24:18,429
Raise. One million.

646
01:24:25,216 --> 01:24:27,485
Seems someone knows
something I don’t.

647
01:24:28,480 --> 01:24:29,626
Fold.

648
01:24:29,825 --> 01:24:31,515
Heads up, gentlemen.

649
01:24:31,712 --> 01:24:33,207
It’s up to you.

650
01:24:46,817 --> 01:24:48,225
Two.

651
01:24:48,961 --> 01:24:50,969
Re-raise. Two million.

652
01:24:52,866 --> 01:24:54,840
And it’s up to you.

653
01:25:05,474 --> 01:25:07,263
I’m all in.

654
01:25:14,371 --> 01:25:16,640
Well, it’s 14 million
and 500,000.

655
01:25:16,836 --> 01:25:19,072
It’s up to you, Monsieur Bond.

656
01:25:21,604 --> 01:25:25,793
Bond will have to go all in
to call his bluff.

657
01:25:26,693 --> 01:25:29,311
-Call.
-Call.

658
01:25:29,732 --> 01:25:32,001
Gentlemen, showdown, please.

659
01:25:33,667 --> 01:25:35,969
Full house. Kings and aces.

660
01:25:36,164 --> 01:25:38,106
Monsieur Le Chiffre.

661
01:25:50,534 --> 01:25:54,079
It’s four jacks.
Monsieur Le Chiffre wins.

662
01:25:57,926 --> 01:26:00,959
You must have thought
I was bluffing, Mr. Bond.

663
01:26:01,606 --> 01:26:02,718
Please.

664
01:26:02,919 --> 01:26:05,122
We will now break for one hour.

665
01:26:05,317 --> 01:26:08,515
When we return,
the big blind will be 200,000.

666
01:26:15,655 --> 01:26:17,248
Good game.

667
01:26:44,232 --> 01:26:47,429
<i>Well, I’m gonna need the other
5 million to buy back in.</i>

668
01:26:47,977 --> 01:26:50,214
I can’t do that, James.

669
01:26:50,728 --> 01:26:53,030
Look, I made a mistake.

670
01:26:53,801 --> 01:26:56,671
I was impatient, maybe I was arrogant,
but I can beat him.

671
01:26:56,873 --> 01:26:58,248
-I’m sorry.
-Sorry?

672
01:26:59,273 --> 01:27:00,648
Sorry?

673
01:27:00,841 --> 01:27:02,531
Try putting that in a sentence.

674
01:27:02,730 --> 01:27:04,071
“Sorry Le Chiffre’s gonna win…

675
01:27:04,265 --> 01:27:06,502
…continue funding terror and killing.”
That kind of sorry?

676
01:27:06,697 --> 01:27:09,632
You lost because of your ego,
and that same ego can’t take it.

677
01:27:09,833 --> 01:27:11,176
That’s what this is about.

678
01:27:11,370 --> 01:27:13,258
All you’re going to do now
is lose more.

679
01:27:13,866 --> 01:27:14,978
Then you’re an idiot.

680
01:27:15,178 --> 01:27:17,928
-I’m sorry?
-I said, you’re a bloody idiot.

681
01:27:19,754 --> 01:27:21,926
Look in my eyes.

682
01:27:22,666 --> 01:27:24,357
I can beat this man, you know that.

683
01:27:26,891 --> 01:27:29,379
Get your hand off my arm.

684
01:27:51,340 --> 01:27:52,453
Vodka martini.

685
01:27:52,653 --> 01:27:55,336
-Shaken or stirred?
-Do I look like I give a damn?

686
01:28:12,783 --> 01:28:14,953
-James.
-Get the girl out.

687
01:28:21,934 --> 01:28:22,861
Funny game, right?

688
01:28:23,054 --> 01:28:26,022
Sorry, I should’ve introduced myself,
seeing as we’re related.

689
01:28:26,734 --> 01:28:29,702
Felix Leiter, a brother from Langley.

690
01:28:31,631 --> 01:28:32,972
You should have a little faith.

691
01:28:33,166 --> 01:28:35,556
If you keep your head about you,
I think you have him.

692
01:28:35,759 --> 01:28:37,930
Had. Excuse me.

693
01:28:38,350 --> 01:28:40,206
You’re not buying in?

694
01:28:41,839 --> 01:28:43,148
No.

695
01:28:46,351 --> 01:28:50,127
Listen, I’m bleeding chips.
I’m not gonna last much longer.

696
01:28:50,320 --> 01:28:52,873
You have a better chance.
I’ll stake you.

697
01:28:53,904 --> 01:28:55,912
I’m saying I’ll give you the money
to keep going.

698
01:28:56,112 --> 01:29:00,782
Just one thing. If you pull it off,
the CIA bring him in.

699
01:29:02,097 --> 01:29:04,333
And what about the winnings?

700
01:29:05,009 --> 01:29:07,465
Does it look like
we need the money?

701
01:29:18,546 --> 01:29:20,553
Shall we up the blinds?

702
01:29:22,673 --> 01:29:24,299
Why not?

703
01:29:27,634 --> 01:29:29,063
Bet.

704
01:29:31,058 --> 01:29:32,651
Raise.

705
01:29:47,539 --> 01:29:49,394
And fold.

706
01:29:51,539 --> 01:29:53,427
Excuse me, please.

707
01:29:55,059 --> 01:29:56,619
Call.

708
01:29:58,035 --> 01:29:59,213
Raise.

709
01:29:59,412 --> 01:30:02,728
Raise. Five hundred thousand.

710
01:30:05,141 --> 01:30:06,995
-Fold.
-Thank you.

711
01:30:09,268 --> 01:30:10,381
Fold.

712
01:30:14,485 --> 01:30:15,947
Fold.

713
01:30:20,662 --> 01:30:22,036
Thank you.

714
01:30:22,229 --> 01:30:23,157
Wins.

715
01:30:43,414 --> 01:30:44,527
Deal me out.

716
01:30:45,494 --> 01:30:48,494
Sorry, sir. You are the big blind.

717
01:30:50,391 --> 01:30:51,885
Small blind, please.

718
01:31:53,370 --> 01:31:55,672
-Who is it?
-It’s 007.

719
01:31:57,275 --> 01:31:59,731
Bond’s been poisoned.
He’s going into cardiac arrest.

720
01:32:01,820 --> 01:32:04,154
Stay calm and don’t interrupt.
Because you’ll be dead…

721
01:32:04,348 --> 01:32:06,869
…within two minutes
unless you do exactly what I tell you.

722
01:32:07,164 --> 01:32:08,276
I’m all ears.

723
01:32:08,476 --> 01:32:09,938
Remove the defibrillator
from the pouch.

724
01:32:10,140 --> 01:32:12,377
-Do we know what it is yet?
-We’re still scanning.

725
01:32:17,789 --> 01:32:20,407
Attach the leads to your chest.

726
01:32:28,701 --> 01:32:30,589
Ventricular tachycardia. Digitalis.

727
01:32:30,878 --> 01:32:33,561
What do we give him? The kit
has amphetamines, antihistamines…

728
01:32:33,758 --> 01:32:35,317
…hydrocortisone. Adrenalin?

729
01:32:35,518 --> 01:32:38,136
-As soon as it reads charged –
-Lidocaine. That’ll work.

730
01:32:38,334 --> 01:32:40,701
Bond, don’t push the red button yet.
Do you hear me? Don’t push it.

731
01:32:40,894 --> 01:32:42,267
His heart’s gonna stop.

732
01:32:42,461 --> 01:32:44,730
There’s only time for one charge
before he passes out.

733
01:32:45,693 --> 01:32:49,403
Take the blue combipen, Bond.
Mid-neck into the vein.

734
01:32:49,598 --> 01:32:51,802
That’ll counteract the digitalis.

735
01:32:54,975 --> 01:32:56,698
You’re going to pass out
in a few seconds.

736
01:32:56,895 --> 01:32:58,269
You need to keep
your heart going.

737
01:32:58,463 --> 01:32:59,641
Push the red button now, Bond.

738
01:33:05,503 --> 01:33:07,837
-Bond, push the damn button!
-Do it now!

739
01:33:53,762 --> 01:33:55,649
-You okay?
-Me?

740
01:33:58,851 --> 01:34:01,339
-Thank you.
-You’re welcome.

741
01:34:01,538 --> 01:34:05,051
-Now get yourself off to a hospital.
-I will do.

742
01:34:06,019 --> 01:34:07,361
As soon as I’ve won this game.

743
01:34:07,554 --> 01:34:10,173
You’re not seriously
going back there?

744
01:34:12,643 --> 01:34:14,466
I wouldn’t dream of it.

745
01:34:16,036 --> 01:34:17,563
Bet. One million.

746
01:34:21,155 --> 01:34:22,650
-All in.
-Call. All in.

747
01:34:22,852 --> 01:34:25,340
Gentlemen, showdown, please.

748
01:34:27,268 --> 01:34:29,090
Two pair. Aces and sevens.

749
01:34:32,868 --> 01:34:35,203
Queen plays. Wins.

750
01:34:43,429 --> 01:34:44,573
Oh, I’m sorry.

751
01:34:44,773 --> 01:34:47,228
That last hand, it nearly killed me.

752
01:34:48,614 --> 01:34:52,061
Gentlemen, with this chip exchange,
we enter the final phase of the game…

753
01:34:52,262 --> 01:34:53,953
…which means no more buy-ins.

754
01:34:54,149 --> 01:34:57,215
The big blind is now
1 million dollars.

755
01:35:04,006 --> 01:35:05,086
Four players.

756
01:35:07,782 --> 01:35:09,091
It’s your bet.

757
01:35:12,967 --> 01:35:14,080
-Monsieur Bond?
-Check.

758
01:35:14,279 --> 01:35:17,956
-Check.
-Twenty-four million in the pot already.

759
01:35:20,711 --> 01:35:22,752
Check. And check.

760
01:35:23,175 --> 01:35:24,703
All check.

761
01:35:25,032 --> 01:35:26,176
Four players.

762
01:35:30,983 --> 01:35:32,326
-Check.
-Check.

763
01:35:37,993 --> 01:35:40,066
All in. Six million.

764
01:35:40,936 --> 01:35:43,358
Bet. Six million. All in.

765
01:35:48,585 --> 01:35:50,822
Five million. All in.

766
01:35:51,017 --> 01:35:53,473
Bet is 6 million.

767
01:36:00,682 --> 01:36:01,959
Raise.

768
01:36:03,466 --> 01:36:04,610
Raise.

769
01:36:04,810 --> 01:36:07,941
Twelve million. Heads up.

770
01:36:37,292 --> 01:36:40,292
Forty million, 500,000. All in.

771
01:36:42,636 --> 01:36:44,392
Raise. All in.

772
01:37:02,509 --> 01:37:05,958
Well, I think I will call you
on that one.

773
01:37:12,526 --> 01:37:13,672
Call.

774
01:37:25,070 --> 01:37:29,096
One hundred and fifteen million
in the pot.

775
01:37:29,295 --> 01:37:31,914
Gentlemen, showdown, please.

776
01:37:35,407 --> 01:37:37,263
Flush. Ace, king, queen.

777
01:37:45,488 --> 01:37:48,357
Full house. Eights full of aces.

778
01:38:05,778 --> 01:38:07,817
A higher full house.

779
01:38:08,017 --> 01:38:09,425
Aces full of sixes.

780
01:38:15,186 --> 01:38:16,331
Monsieur Bond.

781
01:38:32,690 --> 01:38:35,080
Five and seven of spades.

782
01:38:35,283 --> 01:38:36,689
A straight flush.

783
01:38:36,883 --> 01:38:38,127
Four to the eight.

784
01:38:38,323 --> 01:38:40,331
The high hand.

785
01:38:44,852 --> 01:38:46,313
Monsieur Bond wins.

786
01:38:47,284 --> 01:38:49,487
-For you.
-Thank you very much.

787
01:38:51,827 --> 01:38:52,973
Congratulations.

788
01:38:53,172 --> 01:38:56,555
-He’s all yours.
-Much appreciated, brother.

789
01:39:03,252 --> 01:39:04,364
Congratulations.

790
01:39:04,564 --> 01:39:06,353
You know,
I think a celebration’s in order.

791
01:39:06,549 --> 01:39:08,970
You were almost dead an hour ago.

792
01:39:09,813 --> 01:39:12,683
Come on, I’m famished.

793
01:39:22,677 --> 01:39:24,466
Thank you.

794
01:39:31,766 --> 01:39:35,508
Mathis says the Americans
have made contact with Le Chiffre.

795
01:39:35,702 --> 01:39:38,223
They’re going to extract him
before dawn.

796
01:39:38,902 --> 01:39:40,790
You know, I think
I’ll call that a Vesper.

797
01:39:42,135 --> 01:39:43,858
Because of the bitter aftertaste?

798
01:39:44,055 --> 01:39:48,049
No. Because once you’ve tasted it,
that’s all you want to drink.

799
01:39:50,551 --> 01:39:53,518
-I thought that was quite a good line.
-It was a very good line.

800
01:39:54,712 --> 01:39:56,141
But you’re laughing at it.

801
01:39:56,471 --> 01:40:00,563
-Not so much it as you.
-Well, that’s fine then.

802
01:40:06,616 --> 01:40:08,110
I figured out what that is.

803
01:40:10,457 --> 01:40:12,627
It’s an Algerian love knot.

804
01:40:12,825 --> 01:40:15,892
Really? I thought it was
just something pretty.

805
01:40:16,089 --> 01:40:17,649
No, you didn’t.

806
01:40:18,521 --> 01:40:19,928
Someone gave that to you.

807
01:40:23,482 --> 01:40:25,140
He’s a very lucky man.

808
01:40:31,386 --> 01:40:34,103
You can switch off so easily,
can’t you?

809
01:40:34,458 --> 01:40:36,563
It doesn’t bother you,
killing those people?

810
01:40:37,146 --> 01:40:40,048
Well, I wouldn’t be very good
at my job if it did.

811
01:40:40,954 --> 01:40:43,093
I don’t believe you.

812
01:40:43,706 --> 01:40:45,779
You’ve got a choice, you know?

813
01:40:45,978 --> 01:40:47,505
Just because
you’ve done something…

814
01:40:47,707 --> 01:40:49,747
…doesn’t mean
you have to keep doing it.

815
01:40:49,947 --> 01:40:52,729
Why is it people who can’t take advice
always insist on giving it?

816
01:40:52,923 --> 01:40:54,811
You think I can’t take
my own advice?

817
01:40:55,675 --> 01:40:58,228
I think something is driving you.

818
01:40:58,748 --> 01:41:00,690
And I think I’ll never find out
what that is.

819
01:41:06,395 --> 01:41:08,436
Mathis needs me.

820
01:41:09,084 --> 01:41:10,295
Good night.

821
01:41:10,492 --> 01:41:11,768
Congratulations again.

822
01:41:30,269 --> 01:41:32,026
Mathis.

823
01:43:19,395 --> 01:43:23,171
I’m afraid your friend Mathis
is really…

824
01:43:24,388 --> 01:43:26,111
…my friend Mathis.

825
01:45:04,683 --> 01:45:07,301
You’ve taken good care
of your body.

826
01:45:13,578 --> 01:45:15,967
Such a waste.

827
01:45:32,524 --> 01:45:34,280
You know…

828
01:45:34,636 --> 01:45:37,636
…I never understood
all these elaborate tortures.

829
01:45:37,835 --> 01:45:39,941
It’s the simplest thing…

830
01:45:40,140 --> 01:45:43,523
…to cause more pain
than a man can possibly endure.

831
01:45:44,972 --> 01:45:46,085
And of course…

832
01:45:46,285 --> 01:45:49,132
…it’s not only the immediate agony,
but the knowledge…

833
01:45:49,325 --> 01:45:51,878
…that if you do not yield
soon enough…

834
01:45:52,557 --> 01:45:56,037
…there will be little left
to identify you as a man.

835
01:46:01,870 --> 01:46:03,692
The only question remains…

836
01:46:05,133 --> 01:46:07,206
…will you yield in time?

837
01:46:09,199 --> 01:46:12,198
I want the money.

838
01:46:30,160 --> 01:46:33,455
Miss Lynd will give me the account
number, if she hasn’t already.

839
01:46:33,648 --> 01:46:35,917
So all I need from you
is the password.

840
01:46:45,295 --> 01:46:48,395
The password, please.

841
01:46:52,464 --> 01:46:54,668
I’ve got a little itch…

842
01:46:54,865 --> 01:46:56,654
…down there.

843
01:46:57,393 --> 01:46:58,800
Would you mind?

844
01:47:06,225 --> 01:47:09,487
No! No! No!

845
01:47:10,417 --> 01:47:13,963
No. To the right.
To the right. To the right!

846
01:47:14,162 --> 01:47:16,496
You are a funny man, Mr. Bond.

847
01:47:18,354 --> 01:47:19,783
Yeah!

848
01:47:20,978 --> 01:47:24,142
Yes, yes, yes.

849
01:47:29,586 --> 01:47:34,802
Now the whole world’s gonna know
that you died scratching my balls.

850
01:47:36,051 --> 01:47:37,961
I died?

851
01:47:38,163 --> 01:47:39,407
-I died?
-Yes.

852
01:47:39,603 --> 01:47:42,451
Because no matter what you do,
I’m not gonna give you the password.

853
01:47:42,644 --> 01:47:44,399
Which means your clients
will hunt you down…

854
01:47:44,596 --> 01:47:47,313
…and cut you into pieces of meat
while you’re still breathing.

855
01:47:47,507 --> 01:47:48,850
Because if you kill me…

856
01:47:49,044 --> 01:47:51,019
…there’ll be nowhere else to hide.

857
01:47:51,220 --> 01:47:53,904
But you are so wrong!

858
01:47:54,101 --> 01:47:56,970
Because even after I slaughtered
you and your little girlfriend…

859
01:47:57,172 --> 01:47:59,856
…your people would still welcome me
with open arms…

860
01:48:01,333 --> 01:48:04,814
…because they need what I know.

861
01:48:06,004 --> 01:48:07,979
The big picture.

862
01:48:15,574 --> 01:48:17,713
Give me the password…

863
01:48:17,909 --> 01:48:19,764
…and I will at least let her live.

864
01:48:23,286 --> 01:48:26,253
Bond. Do it soon enough
and she might even be in one piece.

865
01:48:38,807 --> 01:48:40,847
You really aren’t going to tell me,
are you?

866
01:48:41,047 --> 01:48:42,771
No.

867
01:48:44,535 --> 01:48:46,358
So I think…

868
01:48:50,712 --> 01:48:54,007
…I’ll feed you
what you seem not to value.

869
01:49:06,617 --> 01:49:08,789
I’ll get the money.

870
01:49:09,656 --> 01:49:12,046
Tell them I’ll get the money.

871
01:49:12,249 --> 01:49:16,527
Money isn’t as valuable to our
organization as knowing who to trust.

872
01:49:39,194 --> 01:49:40,537
Francesco.

873
01:49:41,434 --> 01:49:43,257
Francesco.

874
01:49:55,452 --> 01:49:57,491
Vesper.

875
01:49:59,292 --> 01:50:01,114
Vesper.

876
01:50:03,164 --> 01:50:04,625
No.

877
01:50:05,404 --> 01:50:06,681
Not him.

878
01:50:06,876 --> 01:50:08,699
Not Mathis.

879
01:50:10,460 --> 01:50:11,573
No.

880
01:50:12,380 --> 01:50:14,323
I’ll get the doctor.

881
01:50:16,989 --> 01:50:18,713
Not him.

882
01:50:20,541 --> 01:50:21,654
Any ideas?

883
01:50:25,245 --> 01:50:28,922
-What?
-Why they left the two of you alive.

884
01:50:30,846 --> 01:50:32,221
Where is she?

885
01:50:33,214 --> 01:50:35,036
Sleeping.

886
01:50:35,614 --> 01:50:38,745
Well, I’m supposed
to get you to drink this.

887
01:50:39,806 --> 01:50:41,399
It’s just odd…

888
01:50:41,598 --> 01:50:45,341
…killing everyone else
but leaving you and her untouched.

889
01:50:45,535 --> 01:50:48,731
Almost as if someone
was trying to tell us something.

890
01:50:49,855 --> 01:50:51,894
Get a look at the killer?

891
01:50:52,415 --> 01:50:54,073
No.

892
01:50:55,487 --> 01:50:56,861
Shame.

893
01:50:58,463 --> 01:51:00,121
Drink up.

894
01:51:03,391 --> 01:51:05,464
Anything else you remember?

895
01:51:05,664 --> 01:51:07,606
Anything that can help us?

896
01:51:07,807 --> 01:51:09,368
Help us?

897
01:51:09,567 --> 01:51:11,706
Or help you?

898
01:51:50,434 --> 01:51:51,546
Hello.

899
01:51:51,746 --> 01:51:53,503
Hello.

900
01:51:55,139 --> 01:51:56,382
You all right?

901
01:51:56,995 --> 01:51:59,067
I can’t resist waking you.

902
01:51:59,267 --> 01:52:03,708
Every time I do, you look at me as if
you haven’t seen me in years.

903
01:52:04,803 --> 01:52:06,712
It makes me feel reborn.

904
01:52:10,307 --> 01:52:13,275
If you’d just been born…

905
01:52:13,924 --> 01:52:16,096
…wouldn’t you be naked?

906
01:52:16,836 --> 01:52:18,941
You have me there.

907
01:52:21,509 --> 01:52:24,095
You can have me anywhere.

908
01:52:26,085 --> 01:52:27,546
I can?

909
01:52:27,748 --> 01:52:31,459
Yeah. Here, there,
anywhere you like.

910
01:52:32,421 --> 01:52:35,203
Does this mean
that you’re warming to me?

911
01:52:35,397 --> 01:52:37,503
Yeah. That’s how I would describe it.

912
01:52:37,701 --> 01:52:39,076
It’s just that not so long ago…

913
01:52:39,270 --> 01:52:42,979
…I would have described
your feelings towards me as….

914
01:52:44,390 --> 01:52:46,911
I’m trying to think
of a better word than “loathing.”

915
01:52:47,462 --> 01:52:50,244
I’m afraid I’m a complicated woman.

916
01:52:50,758 --> 01:52:53,147
That is something to be afraid of.

917
01:52:55,815 --> 01:52:59,295
-Hello.
-Oh, perfect timing.

918
01:53:00,678 --> 01:53:03,297
Monsieur Mendel.
How are things in Switzerland?

919
01:53:03,495 --> 01:53:05,405
My apologies,
I do not mean to rush…

920
01:53:05,607 --> 01:53:07,516
…but 120 million
is a large sum of money.

921
01:53:07,719 --> 01:53:10,436
It certainly is. You didn’t bring
any chocolates with you?

922
01:53:10,631 --> 01:53:12,670
I’m afraid not.

923
01:53:13,831 --> 01:53:16,581
If you would type in
the account number.

924
01:53:23,368 --> 01:53:24,709
And now the password.

925
01:53:25,479 --> 01:53:26,592
You can do that.

926
01:53:27,272 --> 01:53:29,247
I would if I knew what it was.

927
01:53:29,832 --> 01:53:35,942
V-E-S-P-E-R.

928
01:53:46,345 --> 01:53:48,069
The funds have been transferred.

929
01:53:48,266 --> 01:53:51,015
Sorry for disturbing you.

930
01:53:52,777 --> 01:53:55,876
-Auf Wiedersehen.
-Auf Wiedersehen, Herr Mendel.

931
01:54:02,186 --> 01:54:03,528
You know, James…

932
01:54:06,026 --> 01:54:08,809
…I just want you to know
that if all that was left of you…

933
01:54:09,002 --> 01:54:12,166
…was your smile
and your little finger…

934
01:54:12,363 --> 01:54:14,981
…you’d still be more of a man
than anyone I’ve ever met.

935
01:54:24,011 --> 01:54:27,524
That’s because you know
what I can do with my little finger.

936
01:54:30,284 --> 01:54:33,994
-I have no idea.
-But you’re aching to find out.

937
01:54:37,132 --> 01:54:40,906
You’re not going to let me
in there, are you?

938
01:54:41,613 --> 01:54:43,652
You’ve got your armor back on.

939
01:54:43,853 --> 01:54:45,030
That’s that.

940
01:54:46,478 --> 01:54:48,932
I have no armor left.

941
01:54:50,125 --> 01:54:52,514
You’ve stripped it from me.

942
01:54:53,357 --> 01:54:55,724
Whatever is left of me….

943
01:54:56,173 --> 01:54:58,923
Whatever is left of me…

944
01:54:59,726 --> 01:55:01,612
…whatever I am…

945
01:55:01,805 --> 01:55:04,194
…I’m yours.

946
01:56:03,122 --> 01:56:05,991
I suppose M won’t miss me
for a couple of days.

947
01:56:06,705 --> 01:56:08,462
She’ll be too busy sweating Mathis.

948
01:56:08,657 --> 01:56:09,803
Mathis?

949
01:56:10,003 --> 01:56:11,944
Remember I told you
about Le Chiffre’s tell?

950
01:56:12,145 --> 01:56:14,480
Well, Mathis told Le Chiffre.

951
01:56:15,026 --> 01:56:16,520
That’s how he wiped me out.

952
01:56:16,722 --> 01:56:20,236
Same goes for the implant. Can’t say
I’m too sorry about losing that.

953
01:56:20,435 --> 01:56:22,539
I can’t believe it.

954
01:56:22,738 --> 01:56:24,265
No, neither could I.

955
01:56:24,722 --> 01:56:27,024
I thought he had my back.

956
01:56:27,666 --> 01:56:29,390
But there you go, lesson learned.

957
01:56:30,739 --> 01:56:33,041
Does everyone have a tell?

958
01:56:34,899 --> 01:56:36,558
Yes.

959
01:56:39,379 --> 01:56:41,071
Everyone.

960
01:56:41,460 --> 01:56:43,215
Everyone except you.

961
01:56:47,508 --> 01:56:49,450
I wonder if that’s why I love you.

962
01:56:51,413 --> 01:56:53,267
You love me?

963
01:56:53,780 --> 01:56:55,951
Enough to quit
and float round the world with you…

964
01:56:56,148 --> 01:56:58,253
…until one of us
has to find an honest job.

965
01:56:58,868 --> 01:57:02,763
But I think that’s gonna have to be you.
I’ve no idea what an honest job is.

966
01:57:03,637 --> 01:57:05,011
You’re serious.

967
01:57:05,940 --> 01:57:07,763
Like you said…

968
01:57:08,310 --> 01:57:09,936
…you do what I do for too long…

969
01:57:10,133 --> 01:57:12,817
…and there won’t be any soul
left to salvage.

970
01:57:13,013 --> 01:57:15,763
I’m leaving with
what little I have left.

971
01:57:17,686 --> 01:57:19,693
Is that enough for you?

972
01:58:59,772 --> 01:59:01,595
-Come on.
-No. No.

973
01:59:02,076 --> 01:59:05,142
No, stop it. Stop.
I have to get to the bank.

974
01:59:05,340 --> 01:59:07,445
What’s the time?

975
01:59:09,596 --> 01:59:11,571
How much do we need
to float for a month?

976
01:59:12,029 --> 01:59:13,719
I’ve got plenty.

977
01:59:13,917 --> 01:59:17,692
No, I want to pay for my half
of our aimless wanderings.

978
01:59:20,509 --> 01:59:22,746
You stopped wearing the necklace.

979
01:59:22,941 --> 01:59:25,975
Yeah. It was time.

980
01:59:26,173 --> 01:59:28,792
Time enough to get over someone?

981
01:59:33,374 --> 01:59:36,603
To realize sometimes
you can forget the past.

982
01:59:44,958 --> 01:59:46,780
Though apparently not
your employer.

983
01:59:51,039 --> 01:59:54,138
Back in one month.

984
01:59:55,167 --> 01:59:57,469
Come on. I’ll get the money…

985
01:59:57,663 --> 01:59:59,736
…you get supplies.

986
02:00:28,193 --> 02:00:30,528
I’ll see you back here
in half an hour.

987
02:00:54,019 --> 02:00:56,354
-Hello, M.
-I got your note.

988
02:00:56,547 --> 02:00:58,140
Yes?

989
02:00:58,339 --> 02:01:00,095
We’ll talk about that later.

990
02:01:00,291 --> 02:01:03,161
Right now I have a lovely man
from the Treasury here…

991
02:01:03,364 --> 02:01:05,818
…wondering if you’re ever
going to deposit the winnings.

992
02:01:09,380 --> 02:01:12,097
That’s a shame.
I didn’t think they’d miss it.

993
02:01:12,292 --> 02:01:15,456
Yes. Well, I told them not to worry.

994
02:01:15,652 --> 02:01:17,725
So you’ll be depositing it today.

995
02:01:18,052 --> 02:01:20,572
On my way to the bank right now.

996
02:01:20,964 --> 02:01:23,549
James Bond for Mr. Mendel.

997
02:01:24,004 --> 02:01:25,117
Hello.

998
02:01:25,316 --> 02:01:28,578
Mr. Mendel? I’m having trouble
accessing the funds in my account.

999
02:01:28,773 --> 02:01:30,529
It was transferred
to the account number…

1000
02:01:30,725 --> 02:01:32,929
…your company gave us, Mr. Bond.

1001
02:01:35,462 --> 02:01:38,723
It appears the funds
are being withdrawn as we speak.

1002
02:01:41,318 --> 02:01:43,074
-Where?
-The Venice branch, of course.

1003
02:01:43,270 --> 02:01:44,447
St. Mark’s Square.

1004
02:01:46,726 --> 02:01:48,352
Is there a problem, Mr. Bond?

1005
02:03:55,630 --> 02:03:56,742
I’ll kill her!

1006
02:03:57,710 --> 02:03:58,854
Allow me.

1007
02:08:08,157 --> 02:08:10,045
I’m sorry, James.

1008
02:11:13,864 --> 02:11:16,482
She had a boyfriend.
A French Algerian.

1009
02:11:16,680 --> 02:11:18,655
They were very much in love.

1010
02:11:19,048 --> 02:11:22,048
He was kidnapped
by the organization behind Le Chiffre.

1011
02:11:22,249 --> 02:11:27,005
And they blackmailed her, threatening
to kill him unless she cooperated.

1012
02:11:27,208 --> 02:11:28,518
We should’ve picked up on it…

1013
02:11:28,713 --> 02:11:30,852
…but sometimes
we’re so focused on our enemies…

1014
02:11:31,049 --> 02:11:32,511
…we forget to watch our friends.

1015
02:11:34,088 --> 02:11:35,877
How are you doing?

1016
02:11:36,202 --> 02:11:38,340
She left her cell phone.

1017
02:11:38,537 --> 02:11:40,806
She must have known I’d check it.

1018
02:11:41,577 --> 02:11:43,650
She knew you were you.

1019
02:11:44,682 --> 02:11:46,821
-Well, at least this clears Mathis.
-No.

1020
02:11:47,018 --> 02:11:48,579
-No?
-No.

1021
02:11:48,778 --> 02:11:51,168
We just proved that she’s guilty,
not that he’s innocent.

1022
02:11:51,370 --> 02:11:53,607
It could’ve been a double blind.
Keep sweating him.

1023
02:11:54,378 --> 02:11:56,070
You don’t trust anyone,
do you, James?

1024
02:11:56,266 --> 02:11:57,826
No.

1025
02:11:58,314 --> 02:12:00,486
Then you’ve learnt your lesson.

1026
02:12:01,259 --> 02:12:03,364
Get back as soon as you can.
We need you.

1027
02:12:04,075 --> 02:12:05,187
Will do.

1028
02:12:07,371 --> 02:12:08,680
If you do need time…

1029
02:12:08,875 --> 02:12:10,085
Why should I need more time?

1030
02:12:11,178 --> 02:12:14,311
The job’s done,
and the bitch is dead.

1031
02:12:15,212 --> 02:12:16,936
James…

1032
02:12:17,547 --> 02:12:20,809
…did you ever ask yourself
why you weren’t killed that night?

1033
02:12:21,387 --> 02:12:23,013
Isn’t it obvious?

1034
02:12:23,212 --> 02:12:27,008
She made a deal to spare your life
in exchange for the money.

1035
02:12:27,212 --> 02:12:29,284
I’m sure she hoped
they would let her live.

1036
02:12:30,796 --> 02:12:33,666
But she must have known
she was going to her death.

1037
02:12:34,732 --> 02:12:37,548
And now we’ll never know
who was behind this.

1038
02:12:37,741 --> 02:12:40,197
The trail’s gone cold.

1039
02:14:04,146 --> 02:14:05,969
-Hello.
-Mr. White?

1040
02:14:06,163 --> 02:14:07,591
We need to talk.

1041
02:14:07,793 --> 02:14:09,582
Who is this?

1042
02:14:38,644 --> 02:14:40,554
The name’s Bond.

1043
02:14:40,756 --> 02:14:42,611
James Bond.

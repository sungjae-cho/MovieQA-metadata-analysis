we're going to Paris ourselves.

348
00:22:49,652 --> 00:22:51,365
[Gasps] Uh, and I've got three-

349
00:22:51,372 --> 00:22:54,474
Well, this one is-
But I've got three tickets here.

350
00:22:54,558 --> 00:22:57,132
- Unfortunately, the third one is for her,
- Oh! Oh!

351
00:22:57,228 --> 00:22:59,720
Anastasia.

352
00:22:59,962 --> 00:23:02,340
- Oh.
- We are going to reunite

353
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:04,860
the Grand Duchess Anastasia
with her grandmother.

354
00:23:04,943 --> 00:23:08,194
- You do kind of resemble her.
- The same blue eyes.

355
00:23:08,281 --> 00:23:10,818
- The Romanov eyes.
- Nicholas' smile.

356
00:23:10,908 --> 00:23:13,066
- Alexandra's chin.
- Oh, look.

357
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:16,031
She even has the grandmother's hands.

358
00:23:16,122 --> 00:23:18,494
She's the same age, the same physical type.

359
00:23:18,583 --> 00:23:21,702
Are you trying to tell me
you think that I am Anastasia?

360
00:23:21,793 --> 00:23:24,795
I've seen thousands of girls
all over the country.

361
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:28,250
Not one of them looks as much like
the Grand Duchess as you.

362
00:23:28,342 --> 00:23:30,916
- Look at the portrait.
- I knew you were crazy.

363
00:23:31,012 --> 00:23:33,633
- But now I think you are both mad.
- Why?

364
00:23:33,723 --> 00:23:37,258
- You don't remember what happened to you.
- No one knows what happened to her.

365
00:23:37,352 --> 00:23:39,475
You're looking for family, in Paris.

366
00:23:39,562 --> 00:23:42,018
And her only family is in Paris.

367
00:23:42,106 --> 00:23:44,347
Have you ever thought about the possibility?

368
00:23:44,441 --> 00:23:46,518
That I could be royalty?

369
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:48,857
- [Dimitri, Vlad] Mm-hmm.
- [Whimpers]

370
00:23:49,155 --> 00:23:52,441
Well, it's kind of hard
to think of yourself as a duchess

371
00:23:52,534 --> 00:23:54,941
- when you're sleeping on a damp floor.
- [Growling, Barks]

372
00:23:55,035 --> 00:23:58,535
But, sure, every lonely girl
would hope she's a princess.

373
00:23:58,622 --> 00:24:02,573
- And, somewhere, one little girl is.
- Hmm.

374
00:24:04,211 --> 00:24:09,170
After all, the name "Anastasia"
means "she will rise again". [Scoffs]

375
00:24:09,259 --> 00:24:13,672
Wish we could help, but the third ticket
is for the Grand Duchess Anastasia.

376
00:24:14,137 --> 00:24:16,214
[Sighs] Good luck.

377
00:24:18,768 --> 00:24:21,722
Why didn't you tell her
about our brilliant plan?

378
00:24:21,813 --> 00:24:26,558
All she wants to do is go to Paris.
Why give away a third of the reward money?

379
00:24:26,651 --> 00:24:28,893
I tell you, we're walking away too soon.

380
00:24:28,987 --> 00:24:31,774
Not to worry. I got it all under control.

381
00:24:32,323 --> 00:24:34,695
All right, walk a little slower.

382
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:39,012
Hmm.

383
00:24:43,023 --> 00:24:45,402
- Hmm.
- [Whimpers]

384
00:24:46,295 --> 00:24:49,795
Three, two, one...

385
00:24:49,882 --> 00:24:51,706
- [Anya] Dimitri!
- Ah!

386
00:24:51,907 --> 00:24:54,046
Right in the palm of our hand.

387
00:24:54,137 --> 00:24:57,007
- Dimitri, wait!
- D-Did you call me?

388
00:24:57,097 --> 00:24:59,716
If I don't remember who I am,
then who's to say I'm not

389
00:24:59,748 --> 00:25:02,056
a princess or a duchess,
or whatever she is, right?

390
00:25:02,854 --> 00:25:05,350
- Mm-hmm. Go on.
- Yeah, and if I'm not Anastasia,

391
00:25:05,379 --> 00:25:07,104
the Empress will know right away.

392
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:10,026
- So it's just an honest mistake.
- [Dimitri] Sounds plausible.

393
00:25:10,444 --> 00:25:13,446
But, if you are the princess,

394
00:25:13,531 --> 00:25:17,825
then you'll finally know who you are
and have your family back.

395
00:25:17,910 --> 00:25:19,986
You know- You know, he's right.

396
00:25:20,079 --> 00:25:22,785
- Either way, it gets you to Paris.
- Right!

397
00:25:23,261 --> 00:25:24,451
Ow!

398
00:25:24,773 --> 00:25:26,356
[Groans]

399
00:25:26,586 --> 00:25:29,500
[Dimitri] May I present
Her Royal Highness,

400
00:25:29,586 --> 00:25:31,960
the Grand Duchess Anastasia.

401
00:25:33,134 --> 00:25:35,290
- [Anastasia] Pooka, we are going to Paris.
- [Pooka Barks]

402
00:25:35,325 --> 00:25:38,080
- [Dimitri] No, the dog stays. - What are
you talking about? The dog goes.

403
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:40,398
- No, the dog does not go.
- [Anastasia] I say he's going.

404
00:25:40,414 --> 00:25:41,888
I'm allergic to dogs.

405
00:25:42,643 --> 00:25:44,295
Anastasia?

406
00:25:44,334 --> 00:25:48,065
You have just one problem there,
fellah. Anastasia's dead.

407
00:25:48,149 --> 00:25:51,150
All the Romanovs are dead. They're dead.

408
00:25:51,235 --> 00:25:53,312
Dead, dead, dead.

409
00:25:53,404 --> 00:25:56,691
Am I right, my friend?
I mean, how could that be Ana- [Hisses]

410
00:25:57,473 --> 00:25:59,436
[Screams, Whimpers]

411
00:26:02,163 --> 00:26:03,375
Oh, come on.

412
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:07,406
Am I supposed to believe
that thing woke up after all these years

413
00:26:07,502 --> 00:26:10,668
just because some guy
claims she's a Romanov? [Hissing]

414
00:26:12,297 --> 00:26:14,219
Okay, Okay, I get the message.

415
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:17,803
Enough already with the glowing
and the smoke people.

416

[Signs]

417
00:26:20,807 --> 00:26:27,344
If that thing's come back to life,
it must mean Anastasia's alive.

418
00:26:27,439 --> 00:26:29,728
- [Dimitri] Just leave the dog.
- I am not leaving the dog.

419
00:26:29,815 --> 00:26:32,306
- And that's her.
- [Vlad] We've got a train to catch.

Yes. In a manner of speaking.

Whoa, that fell right out there, sir.

438
00:27:31,962 --> 00:27:34,631
- Something's happened?
- Yeah.

439
00:27:35,673 --> 00:27:37,832
- Whoopsie.
- I knew it.

440
00:27:37,926 --> 00:27:41,544
I could feel the dark forces stirring.

441
00:27:41,637 --> 00:27:44,841
I'm not surprised, because I saw her.
Anastasia.

442
00:27:44,933 --> 00:27:47,340
Anastasia? Alive?

443
00:27:47,977 --> 00:27:50,053
Uh, sir, your lips-
They're uh-

444
00:27:50,146 --> 00:27:52,816
That Romanov brat!

445
00:27:52,899 --> 00:27:54,403
Yeah, ain't that the kick in the head?

446
00:27:54,423 --> 00:27:56,944
I guess a curse
just ain't what it used to be, huh, sir?

447
00:27:57,027 --> 00:28:00,361
That's why I was stuck here in limbo.

448
00:28:00,448 --> 00:28:02,939
My curse is unfulfilled.

you've been dead,

00:28:21,867 --> 00:28:24,587
- You look pretty good.
- Bah. [Sobbing]

Come on! For a minute there,
you had your old spark back.

from the dark forces-

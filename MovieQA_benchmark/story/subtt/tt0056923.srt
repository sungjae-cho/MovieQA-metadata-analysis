1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,074


2
00:03:51,285 --> 00:03:53,411
Holа!

3
00:03:53,495 --> 00:03:57,457
Don't tell me.
Ya didn't know it was loaded.

4
00:03:57,541 --> 00:04:00,752
- Sylvie!
- Oh.

5
00:04:00,836 --> 00:04:04,130
Can't he do something constructive,
like start an avalanche or something?

6
00:04:04,214 --> 00:04:06,299
Va jouer, mon chéri.

7
00:04:08,218 --> 00:04:10,887
When you start to eat like this,
something is the matter.

8
00:04:13,891 --> 00:04:15,808
Sylvie, I'm getting a divorce.

9
00:04:15,893 --> 00:04:20,104
- What? From Charles?
- He's the only husband I have.

10
00:04:20,189 --> 00:04:25,068
- I've tried to make it work, really I have, but -
- But what?

11
00:04:25,152 --> 00:04:28,696
I can't explain. It's just that I'm too miserable
to go on any longer like this.

12
00:04:31,033 --> 00:04:34,869
It is infuriating that your unhappiness
does not turn to fat.

13
00:04:37,498 --> 00:04:41,167
But I don't understand.
Why do you want a divorce?

14
00:04:41,251 --> 00:04:44,128
Because I don't love him.
And he obviously doesn't love me.

15
00:04:44,213 --> 00:04:46,714
That's no reason to get a divorce.

16
00:04:46,799 --> 00:04:48,841
With a rich husband
and this year's clothes...

17
00:04:48,926 --> 00:04:51,719
you won't find it difficult
to make some new friends.

18
00:04:51,804 --> 00:04:54,389
I admit I came to Paris
to escape American provincial...

19
00:04:54,473 --> 00:04:57,475
but that doesn't mean I'm ready
for French traditional.

20
00:04:57,559 --> 00:05:00,186
I loathe the whole idea
of divorce, Sylvie.

21
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:02,438
But if only Charles had
been honest with me.

22
00:05:02,523 --> 00:05:04,774
That's all I ask of anybody:
the simple truth.

23
00:05:04,858 --> 00:05:09,570
But with Charles,
everything is secrecy and lies.

24
00:05:11,115 --> 00:05:13,282
He's hiding something
from me, Sylvie -

25
00:05:13,367 --> 00:05:16,869
something terrible -
and it frightens me.

26
00:05:16,954 --> 00:05:18,871
Does he belong to you?

27
00:05:18,956 --> 00:05:21,666
It's hers. Where'd you find him?
Robbing a bank?

28
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:23,876
He was throwing snowballs
at Baron Rothschild.

29
00:05:23,961 --> 00:05:27,171
- Oh, thank you.
- Do we know each other?

30
00:05:27,256 --> 00:05:30,675
- Why? Do you think we're going to?
- I don't know. How would I know?

31
00:05:30,759 --> 00:05:32,927
Because I already know
an awful lot of people.

32
00:05:33,012 --> 00:05:35,888
Until one of them dies
I couldn't possibly meet anyone else.

33
00:05:35,973 --> 00:05:40,143
Hmm. Well, if anyone goes
on the critical list, let me know.

34
00:05:40,227 --> 00:05:42,186
- Quitter.
- Uh, what?

35
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:45,314
You give up awfully easily, don't you?

36
00:05:45,399 --> 00:05:49,152
Viens, Jean-Louis. Let us make a walk.
I've never seen a Rothschild before.

37
00:05:54,992 --> 00:05:58,661
Clever fellow. Almost missed me.

38
00:05:58,746 --> 00:06:00,663
Thank you.

39
00:06:00,748 --> 00:06:05,293
- You're blocking my view.
- Oh.

40
00:06:05,377 --> 00:06:08,421
- Which view would you prefer?
- The one you're blocking.

41
00:06:08,505 --> 00:06:11,174
It's my last chance.
I'm flying back to Paris this afternoon.

42
00:06:11,258 --> 00:06:13,676
- What's your name?
- Peter Joshua.

43
00:06:13,761 --> 00:06:16,429
- Mine's Regina Lampert.
- Is there a Mr. Lampert?

44
00:06:16,513 --> 00:06:17,680
- Yes.
- Good for you.

45
00:06:17,765 --> 00:06:19,348
No, it isn't.
I'm getting a divorce.

46
00:06:19,433 --> 00:06:22,560
- Please, not on my account.
- No. I don't really love him.

47
00:06:22,644 --> 00:06:26,189
- At least you're honest.
- Hmm. Is there a Mrs. Joshua?

48
00:06:26,273 --> 00:06:28,566
Yes, but we're divorced.

49
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:30,943
That wasn't a proposal.
I'm just curious.

50
00:06:31,028 --> 00:06:33,404
Is your husband with you?

51
00:06:33,489 --> 00:06:35,948
Oh, no, Charles is never with me.
What do people call you? Pete?

52
00:06:36,033 --> 00:06:38,451
Mr. Joshua.

53
00:06:38,535 --> 00:06:41,871
- I've enjoyed talking with you.
- Now you're angry.

54
00:06:41,955 --> 00:06:45,291
No, I just have a lot of packing to do.
I'm going back to Paris, too.

55
00:06:45,375 --> 00:06:48,336
Wasn't it Shakespeare who said
when strangers do meet in far-off lands...

56
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:50,379
they should ere long
see each other again?

57
00:06:50,464 --> 00:06:53,591
- Shakespeare never said that.
- How do you know?

58
00:06:53,675 --> 00:06:55,635
It's terrible.
You just made it up.

59
00:06:55,719 --> 00:06:57,637
Well, it sounds right.
You going to call me?

60
00:06:57,721 --> 00:07:00,014
- Are you in the book?
- Well, Charles is.

61
00:07:00,099 --> 00:07:02,225
- Is there only one Charles Lampert?
- Mmm.

62
00:07:03,435 --> 00:07:06,729
Lord, I hope so.

63
00:07:18,367 --> 00:07:20,326
Good-bye, Sylvie, and thanks.

64
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:22,829
When you get your divorce,
are you going back to America?

65
00:07:22,913 --> 00:07:27,750
- Don't you want me to stay?
- Of course, but if you went
back and wrote me a letter -

66
00:07:27,835 --> 00:07:30,503
You could have the stamps.
I'll get you some here, okay?

67
00:07:30,587 --> 00:07:33,548
- Okay.
- Good-bye.

68
00:07:42,224 --> 00:07:44,142
Merci.

69
00:07:58,866 --> 00:08:00,783
Honorine?

70
00:08:04,288 --> 00:08:06,205
Honorine.

71
00:08:50,167 --> 00:08:52,835
- Madame Charles Lampert?
- Yes.

72
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:56,547
I'm Inspector Edouard Grandpierre
of the police judiciaire.

73
00:08:56,632 --> 00:08:59,175
Would you be so kind
as to come with me, please?

74
00:09:22,616 --> 00:09:24,075
Well, madame?

75
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:28,079
You are positive?

76
00:09:30,624 --> 00:09:32,750
You loved him?

77
00:09:34,169 --> 00:09:36,087
I'm very cold.

78
00:09:48,475 --> 00:09:50,643
We discovered your husband's body...

79
00:09:50,727 --> 00:09:54,313
lying next to the tracks
of the Paris-Bordeaux railroad line.

80
00:09:55,565 --> 00:09:57,650
He was dressed only in his pajamas.

81
00:09:57,734 --> 00:10:02,363
Do you know of any reason
why he might have wanted to leave France?

82
00:10:02,447 --> 00:10:04,782
Leave? No.

83
00:10:04,866 --> 00:10:09,662
Your husband possessed
a ticket of passage on the Maranguape.

84
00:10:09,746 --> 00:10:12,915
It sailed for Venezuela
this morning at 7:00.

85
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,917
I'm very confused.

86
00:10:15,002 --> 00:10:18,504
- He was American, your husband?
- Swiss.

87
00:10:18,588 --> 00:10:21,382
Ah, Swiss.
His profession?

88
00:10:21,466 --> 00:10:24,302
- He didn't have one.
- He was a wealthy man?

89
00:10:24,386 --> 00:10:26,304
I suppose so.
I don't know.

90
00:10:26,388 --> 00:10:29,640
- About how wealthy, would you say?
- I don't know.

91
00:10:29,725 --> 00:10:31,851
Where did he keep his money?

92
00:10:31,935 --> 00:10:33,853
I don't know.

93
00:10:33,937 --> 00:10:37,356
Besides yourself,
who is his nearest relative?

94
00:10:37,441 --> 00:10:42,194
- I don't know.
- That's absurd, madame. Totalement absurde.

95
00:10:42,279 --> 00:10:44,488
I know. I'm sorry.

96
00:10:44,573 --> 00:10:48,075
- It is all right?
- I wish you wouldn't.

97
00:10:52,873 --> 00:10:55,291
- Les effets de Lampert.
- D'accord.

98
00:10:56,668 --> 00:11:01,213
On Wednesday last, your husband sold the entire
contents of the apartment at public auction.

99
00:11:01,298 --> 00:11:03,215
Everything.

100
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:06,510
The gallery paid him
1,250,000 new francs -

101
00:11:06,595 --> 00:11:09,388
in dollars,
a quarter of a million.

102
00:11:09,473 --> 00:11:12,808
The authorities in Bordeaux searched
his compartment on the train.

103
00:11:12,893 --> 00:11:14,810
They searched it thoroughly.

104
00:11:14,895 --> 00:11:17,772
They did not find $250,000.

105
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:25,404
These few things are all that was found
in the train compartment.

106
00:11:25,489 --> 00:11:29,575
There was no other baggage.
Your husband must have been in a great hurry.

107
00:11:29,659 --> 00:11:33,913
One wallet containing 4,000 francs.

108
00:11:33,997 --> 00:11:37,875
One agenda. His last notation was
made yesterday, Thursday -

109
00:11:37,959 --> 00:11:40,753
5:00 p.m., Jardins des Champs-Г‰lysГ©es.

110
00:11:40,837 --> 00:11:42,755
- Why there?
- I don't know.

111
00:11:42,839 --> 00:11:47,426
- Perhaps he met somebody.
- Obviously.

112
00:11:47,511 --> 00:11:50,054
One ticket of passage to South America.

113
00:11:50,138 --> 00:11:54,934
One letter, stamped but unsealed,
addressed to you.

114
00:11:56,019 --> 00:11:58,312
May I see it, please?

115
00:12:01,483 --> 00:12:04,360
"My dear Regina,
I hope you are enjoying your holiday.

116
00:12:04,444 --> 00:12:06,612
"MegГЁve can be so lovely
at this time of year.

117
00:12:06,696 --> 00:12:09,115
"The days pass very slowly,
and I hope to see you soon.

118
00:12:09,199 --> 00:12:11,117
"As always, Charles.

119
00:12:11,201 --> 00:12:15,579
P.S. Your dentist called yesterday.
Your appointment has been changed."

120
00:12:15,664 --> 00:12:17,581
Not much, is it?

121
00:12:17,666 --> 00:12:20,042
We took the liberty
of calling your dentist.

122
00:12:20,127 --> 00:12:22,044
We thought perhaps
we would learn something.

123
00:12:22,129 --> 00:12:24,463
- Did you?
- Yes.

124
00:12:24,548 --> 00:12:26,882
Your appointment has been changed.

125
00:12:34,433 --> 00:12:37,143
One key to your apartment.

126
00:12:37,227 --> 00:12:40,187
One comb.

127
00:12:40,272 --> 00:12:42,273
One fountain pen.

128
00:12:42,357 --> 00:12:44,650
One toothbrush.

129
00:12:44,734 --> 00:12:47,862
One tin of tooth powder.
That is all.

130
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:54,201
If you will sign this list,
you may take the things with you.

131
00:12:55,704 --> 00:12:57,746
Is that all?
May I leave now?

132
00:12:57,831 --> 00:13:00,416
One more question.

133
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:03,419
Is this your husband's passport?

134
00:13:04,504 --> 00:13:07,089
Yes.

135
00:13:07,174 --> 00:13:09,175
And this?

136
00:13:10,594 --> 00:13:13,137
I don't understand.

137
00:13:13,221 --> 00:13:22,104
And this?

138
00:13:53,762 --> 00:13:55,888
Oh, I telephoned but nobody answered.

139
00:13:55,972 --> 00:13:59,725
- Hello.
- Hello.

140
00:13:59,809 --> 00:14:04,146
I wanted to tell you how sorry I am
and see if there's anything I can do.

141
00:14:04,231 --> 00:14:06,232
How did you find out?

142
00:14:06,316 --> 00:14:08,651
It's in the afternoon papers.

143
00:14:08,735 --> 00:14:12,571
- I'm very sorry.
- Thank you.

144
00:14:12,656 --> 00:14:15,574
Uh-- Uh, I pressed the bell,
but it isn't ringing, I guess.

145
00:14:15,659 --> 00:14:17,535
I know.
There's no electricity.

146
00:14:20,038 --> 00:14:21,956
Well, where did everything go?

147
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:25,167
Charles sold it all at auction.
This is all I have left.

148
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:31,006
I love this room, but Charles never really
saw it - only the things in it.

149
00:14:32,968 --> 00:14:34,927
I think I prefer it this way.

150
00:14:36,179 --> 00:14:38,097
What are you going to do?

151
00:14:38,181 --> 00:14:41,684
Try and get my old job back
at EURESCO, I suppose.

152
00:14:41,768 --> 00:14:45,563
- Doing what?
- I'm a simultaneous translator, like Sylvie.

153
00:14:45,647 --> 00:14:48,274
Only she's English into French,
and I'm French into English.

154
00:14:48,358 --> 00:14:51,735
That's what I was doing
before I married Charles.

155
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:54,196
The police probably think I killed him.

156
00:14:54,281 --> 00:14:56,532
Instant divorce, you mean?

157
00:14:56,616 --> 00:14:59,618
Something like that.

158
00:14:59,703 --> 00:15:02,538
It's terrible it ended this way, though -

159
00:15:02,622 --> 00:15:06,041
tossed off a train
like a sack of third-class mail.

160
00:15:06,126 --> 00:15:09,420
- Well, come on. You can't stay here.
- I don't know where to go.

161
00:15:09,504 --> 00:15:11,880
We'll find you a hotel.

162
00:15:13,049 --> 00:15:15,634
Nothing too expensive.

163
00:15:15,719 --> 00:15:17,803
I'm not a lady of leisure
anymore, you know.

164
00:15:17,887 --> 00:15:20,306
Something clean and modest
and near enough to EURESCO...

165
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:22,474
so you can take a cab when it rains.

166
00:15:22,559 --> 00:15:24,768
- Okay?
- Okay.

167
00:15:42,203 --> 00:15:45,497
Not a very large turnout, is it?

168
00:15:45,582 --> 00:15:47,833
Didn't Charles have any friends?

169
00:15:47,917 --> 00:15:50,836
Don't ask me.
I'm only the widow.

170
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:54,548
If Charles had died in bed,
we wouldn't even have him.

171
00:15:57,927 --> 00:16:00,471
At least he knows
how to behave at funerals.

172
00:16:07,937 --> 00:16:11,398
Have you no idea
who could have done it?

173
00:16:11,483 --> 00:16:15,736
Until two days ago the only thing
I really knew about Charles was his name.

174
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:18,447
Now it seems I didn't even know that.

175
00:16:37,133 --> 00:16:41,220
- He must have known Charles pretty well.
- How can you tell?

176
00:16:41,304 --> 00:16:43,305
He's allergic to him.

177
00:16:48,103 --> 00:16:50,020
Bless you.

178
00:16:50,105 --> 00:16:53,232
- Do you know him?
- Never seen him before.

179
00:17:31,896 --> 00:17:33,856
Arrivederci, Charlie.

180
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:42,698
Miz Lampert, ma'am -

181
00:17:43,783 --> 00:17:45,868
Uh, Miz Lampert, ma'am...

182
00:17:47,162 --> 00:17:49,705
Charlie had no call
of doin' it thataway.

183
00:17:49,789 --> 00:17:52,207
No sirree.

184
00:18:29,037 --> 00:18:31,246
What next?

185
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:38,212
Mille pardons, madame.

186
00:18:38,296 --> 00:18:43,342
- Merci.
- Pardon. Pardon.

187
00:18:43,426 --> 00:18:46,804
Pardon. Pardon.

188
00:18:46,888 --> 00:18:50,015
- Who's it from?
- The American Embassy.

189
00:19:02,278 --> 00:19:05,823
I bluffed the old man out of the last pot
with a pair of deuces.

190
00:19:05,907 --> 00:19:07,825
What's so depressing about that?

191
00:19:07,909 --> 00:19:11,119
Well, if I can do it,
what are the Russians doing to him?

192
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:26,051
Hello?

193
00:19:26,135 --> 00:19:28,929
Is there anything wrong, Miss Tompkins?

194
00:19:29,013 --> 00:19:31,723
Uh, Miss Tompkins isn't here.

195
00:19:33,810 --> 00:19:37,896
Oh, I'm sorry.
My secretary must have gone to lunch.

196
00:19:37,981 --> 00:19:41,567
- Uh, you are -
- Mrs. Lampert. Mrs. Charles Lampert.

197
00:19:41,651 --> 00:19:46,446
Oh, yes. Please, uh,
come in, Mrs. Lampert.

198
00:19:48,074 --> 00:19:50,993
Excuse me for a moment, Mrs. Lampert.

199
00:19:51,077 --> 00:19:53,829
It's a stubborn little devil.

200
00:19:54,914 --> 00:19:58,208
Dry cleaning-wise,
things are all fouled up.

201
00:19:58,293 --> 00:20:03,630
I had a good man -
a really excellent man on the Rue Ponthieu...

202
00:20:03,715 --> 00:20:08,927
but H.Q. asked us to use the plant here
in the building to ease the gold outflow.

203
00:20:09,012 --> 00:20:11,680
Mr. Bartholomew,
are you quite sure you know who I am?

204
00:20:11,764 --> 00:20:13,849
You're Charles Lampert's widow, yes?

205
00:20:15,101 --> 00:20:17,060
I'm very sorry.

206
00:20:18,354 --> 00:20:21,148
Last time I sent out a tie,
only the spot came back.

207
00:20:22,483 --> 00:20:25,444
VoilГ , as they say.

208
00:20:25,528 --> 00:20:27,654
Won't you sit down, Mrs. Lampert?

209
00:20:29,699 --> 00:20:31,992
I've got something here.

210
00:20:33,536 --> 00:20:36,788
I've got liverwurst, liverwurst,
chicken and liverwurst.

211
00:20:36,873 --> 00:20:38,957
No, thank you.

212
00:20:39,042 --> 00:20:42,753
Mrs. Lampert,
do you know what C.I.A. is?

213
00:20:42,837 --> 00:20:45,172
I don't suppose it's an airline, is it?

214
00:20:46,716 --> 00:20:49,968
Central Intelligence Agency. C.I.A.

215
00:20:50,053 --> 00:20:52,054
You mean spies and all of that?

216
00:20:52,138 --> 00:20:55,474
- Only we call them agents.
- "We"? You mean you -

217
00:20:55,558 --> 00:20:57,559
Someone has to do it, Mrs. Lampert.

218
00:20:57,644 --> 00:21:00,646
I didn't think people like you
were supposed to admit -

219
00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:06,318
Oh, I'm not an agent.
I'm an administrator, a desk jockey...

220
00:21:06,402 --> 00:21:10,864
trying to run a bureau
of overworked men with underallocated...

221
00:21:10,949 --> 00:21:12,824
funds.

222
00:21:12,909 --> 00:21:15,327
Congress seems to think
that all a spy needs -

223
00:21:15,411 --> 00:21:19,122
- Agent.
- Yes.

224
00:21:19,207 --> 00:21:24,294
That all he needs is a codebook,
a cyanide pill and he's in business.

225
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:28,298
What's all this got to do
with me, Mr. Bartholomew?

226
00:21:28,383 --> 00:21:31,468
Your husband was wanted
by the United States government.

227
00:21:34,555 --> 00:21:36,473
May I have a sandwich, please?

228
00:21:36,557 --> 00:21:39,768
- Chicken or liverwurst?
- Chicken.

229
00:21:39,852 --> 00:21:45,107
To be more specific, Mrs. Lampert,
your husband was wanted by this agency.

230
00:21:45,191 --> 00:21:47,109
- So that was it.
- Yes.

231
00:21:47,193 --> 00:21:49,361
We, of course, knew him
by his real name -

232
00:21:49,445 --> 00:21:52,698
Voss. Charles Voss.

233
00:21:55,076 --> 00:21:56,994
All right, Mrs. Voss.

234
00:21:57,078 --> 00:22:01,790
I'd like you to look at this photograph
for a moment, please.

235
00:22:01,874 --> 00:22:04,626
Tell us if you recogni - Oh.

236
00:22:05,628 --> 00:22:07,546
By the way,
have you seen this one?

237
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:10,924
Scott, Cathy and Ham, Jr.

238
00:22:11,009 --> 00:22:13,719
- Very sweet.
- Aren't they?

239
00:22:13,803 --> 00:22:16,638
- All right, Mrs. Voss -
- Please stop calling me that.

240
00:22:16,723 --> 00:22:20,726
- Lampert's the name on the marriage license.
- I'm terribly sorry.

241
00:22:20,810 --> 00:22:24,980
Mrs. Lampert, would you look at that photograph
and tell me if you recognize anyone?

242
00:22:25,064 --> 00:22:27,816
Just a moment.
Have a good look.

243
00:22:30,653 --> 00:22:33,321
- It's Charles.
- Very good.

244
00:22:33,406 --> 00:22:38,702
- He looks so young. When was this taken?
- 1944. Next, please.

245
00:22:38,786 --> 00:22:41,997
The man who was
at the funeral yesterday.

246
00:22:42,081 --> 00:22:44,249
A tall man in a corduroy suit.

247
00:22:44,333 --> 00:22:49,004
- Does the name Tex Penthollow
mean anything to you?
- No.

248
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:51,006
- You like some wine?
- No, thank you.

249
00:22:51,090 --> 00:22:53,508
Next, please.

250
00:22:53,593 --> 00:22:57,387
He was there, too.
A little less hair, but it's the same one.

251
00:22:57,472 --> 00:23:00,515
Do you know him, Mrs. Lampert?
Leopold W. Gideon?

252
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,851
- No.
- The last one, please.

253
00:23:02,935 --> 00:23:06,688
That's a face you don't forget.

254
00:23:06,773 --> 00:23:09,649
- He was there, too.
- Herman Scobie.

255
00:23:09,734 --> 00:23:13,361
- You've never seen him before either?
- No, thank heaven.

256
00:23:14,447 --> 00:23:18,950
Mrs. Lampert, I'm very much afraid
that you are in a great deal of danger.

257
00:23:19,035 --> 00:23:21,203
Why should I be in any danger?

258
00:23:21,287 --> 00:23:24,122
You're Charles Voss's wife.

259
00:23:24,207 --> 00:23:26,374
Now that he's dead,
you're their only lead.

260
00:23:26,459 --> 00:23:30,128
Mr. Bartholomew,
if you're trying to frighten me...

261
00:23:30,213 --> 00:23:32,464
you're doing a first-rate job.

262
00:23:32,548 --> 00:23:35,050
Please do what we ask, Mrs. Lampert.
It's your only chance.

263
00:23:35,134 --> 00:23:38,929
Gladly. But I don't know what you want.
You haven't told me.

264
00:23:39,013 --> 00:23:41,890
Oh? I haven't?

265
00:23:43,101 --> 00:23:46,478
Well, it's the money,
Mrs. Lampert, the money.

266
00:23:46,562 --> 00:23:50,649
The $250,000 Charles Voss
received from the auction.

267
00:23:50,733 --> 00:23:53,610
Those three men want it, too.
They want it very badly.

268
00:23:53,694 --> 00:23:56,321
But that's Charles's money, not theirs.

269
00:23:56,405 --> 00:23:59,699
Oh, Mrs. Lampert, I'd love to see you try
and convince them of that.

270
00:23:59,784 --> 00:24:03,453
- Oh, boy.
- But then whose is it? His or theirs?

271
00:24:04,455 --> 00:24:06,331
Ours.

272
00:24:06,415 --> 00:24:08,667
Oh.

273
00:24:08,751 --> 00:24:12,754
Charles Voss stole $250,000
from the United States government.

274
00:24:12,839 --> 00:24:16,675
- I'm afraid we want it back.
- But I don't have it.

275
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:20,512
That's impossible, Mrs. Lampert.

276
00:24:20,596 --> 00:24:22,514
You're the only one who could have it.

277
00:24:22,598 --> 00:24:25,725
Mr. Bartholomew,
if I had a quarter of a million dollars...

278
00:24:25,810 --> 00:24:27,769
believe me, I'd know it.

279
00:24:27,854 --> 00:24:30,689
Nevertheless, Mrs. Lampert, you've got it.

280
00:24:30,773 --> 00:24:33,692
You mean it's just lying around somewhere,
all that cash?

281
00:24:33,776 --> 00:24:38,572
Or a certified check,
safe-deposit key, baggage claim.

282
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:40,949
- Look for it. I'm quite sure you'll find it.
- But -

283
00:24:41,033 --> 00:24:45,537
Look for it.
Look just as hard and as fast as you can.

284
00:24:45,621 --> 00:24:47,956
You may not have a great deal of time.

285
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:52,085
Those three men know you've got
the money just as surely as we do.

286
00:24:52,170 --> 00:24:54,462
You won't be safe until
the money's in our hands.

287
00:24:54,547 --> 00:24:56,673
Is that clear?

288
00:24:56,757 --> 00:25:00,719
Here's where you're
to call me, day or night.

289
00:25:00,803 --> 00:25:03,180
It's a direct line to both my office -

290
00:25:03,264 --> 00:25:05,182
and my apartment.

291
00:25:05,266 --> 00:25:07,642
And please don't tell anyone
about coming to see us today.

292
00:25:07,727 --> 00:25:10,020
It could prove fatal
for them as well as yourself.

293
00:25:10,104 --> 00:25:13,356
As I said, Mrs. Lampert,
I'm afraid you're in a great deal of danger.

294
00:25:13,441 --> 00:25:15,901
I regret very much
having to say this, but...

295
00:25:15,985 --> 00:25:19,237
please remember what happened
to your husband.

296
00:25:34,837 --> 00:25:37,547
- Hello.
- Hello, Peter.

297
00:25:37,632 --> 00:25:41,468
Didn't you telephone me
to meet you on that corner over there?

298
00:25:41,552 --> 00:25:43,720
I'm sorry.
I heard the children laughing.

299
00:25:45,181 --> 00:25:49,017
- Do you understand French?
- Not a word.

300
00:25:49,101 --> 00:25:51,603
I'm still having trouble with English.

301
00:25:51,687 --> 00:25:54,105
The man and the woman are married.

302
00:25:54,190 --> 00:25:57,234
Oh, I can see that.
They're batting each other over the head.

303
00:25:57,318 --> 00:25:59,277
Ay, ay, ay!

304
00:25:59,362 --> 00:26:03,240
Oh ! Qu'est-ce qui se passe?

305
00:26:03,324 --> 00:26:06,534
- Who's that with the hat?
- That's the policeman.

306
00:26:06,619 --> 00:26:09,120
He wants to arrest Judy
for killing Punch.

307
00:26:11,332 --> 00:26:14,918
- What's she saying now?
- That she's innocent.

308
00:26:15,002 --> 00:26:17,921
She didn't do it.

309
00:26:18,005 --> 00:26:21,466
- Oh, she did it, all right.
- I believe her.

310
00:26:23,636 --> 00:26:26,721
- Well, who was that?
- That's Punch, of course.

311
00:26:26,806 --> 00:26:29,349
"Punch, of course"?
I thought he was dead.

312
00:26:29,433 --> 00:26:32,477
He's only pretending,
to teach her a lesson.

313
00:26:33,896 --> 00:26:38,066
Only he is dead, Peter.
I saw him. He's not pretending.

314
00:26:38,150 --> 00:26:40,860
Somebody threw him off a train.

315
00:26:40,945 --> 00:26:45,282
Charles was mixed up in something terrible.
What am I going to do?

316
00:26:45,366 --> 00:26:47,409
I wish you'd let me help you.

317
00:26:47,493 --> 00:26:50,328
It doesn't sound like the sort of thing
a young woman can handle by herself.

318
00:26:54,583 --> 00:26:57,877
How about making me vice president
in charge of cheering you up?

319
00:26:59,714 --> 00:27:02,090
Starting tonight?

320
00:27:07,346 --> 00:27:10,473
Bonsoir, messieurs, dames.
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

321
00:27:10,558 --> 00:27:12,434
Buona sera, signore e signori.

322
00:27:12,518 --> 00:27:16,730
Ce soir, comme tous les autres soirs
d'ailleurs, vous savez trГЁs bien...

323
00:27:16,814 --> 00:27:20,692
qui ici au Black Sheep Club,
I'attraction, c'est vous!

324
00:27:20,776 --> 00:27:24,362
Alors, approchez-vous, messieurs, dames.

325
00:27:24,447 --> 00:27:26,614
Venez ici, step right up,
ladies and gentlemen.

326
00:27:26,699 --> 00:27:29,409
- What's going on?
- Fun and games.

327
00:27:29,493 --> 00:27:32,203
- Evidently we're the floor show. Come on.
- You and me?

328
00:27:32,288 --> 00:27:34,873
Everyone.

329
00:27:34,957 --> 00:27:36,875
Avanti, avanti,
signore e signori.

330
00:27:36,959 --> 00:27:39,336
Ecoutez-moi bien.
Les rГЁgles du jeu sont trГЁs simple.

331
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:41,796
Ah, ecoutez-moi.
Alors, il y a deux Г©quipes.

332
00:27:41,881 --> 00:27:45,550
There are two teams,
et pour chaque Г©quipe, il y a une orange.

333
00:27:45,634 --> 00:27:49,471
For every team, there is one orange.
Una arancia.

334
00:27:49,555 --> 00:27:52,891
Eine Apfelsine. Vous mettez I'orange
sur le menton comme Г§a -

335
00:27:52,975 --> 00:27:54,559
put the orange in like so.

336
00:27:54,643 --> 00:27:56,394
Vous passez cette orange
a la personne derriГЁre vous -

337
00:27:56,479 --> 00:27:58,396
You pass the orange
to the person behind you...

338
00:27:58,481 --> 00:28:00,607
mais sans servir les mains.

339
00:28:00,691 --> 00:28:03,651
Without the use of your hands.
Are you ready?

340
00:28:03,736 --> 00:28:07,072
Uno, due, tre -

341
00:29:08,217 --> 00:29:10,176
Whoop.

342
00:29:44,587 --> 00:29:46,671
- Mrs. Lampert.
- Who are you?

343
00:29:46,755 --> 00:29:49,674
- Didn't Charles tell you, Mrs. Lampert?
- Tell me what?

344
00:29:49,758 --> 00:29:52,302
It doesn't belong to you.
You do know that, don't you?

345
00:29:52,386 --> 00:29:55,263
- I don't know anyth -
- Mrs. Lampert.

346
00:29:55,347 --> 00:29:58,933
Any morning now you could
wake up dead, Mrs. Lampert.

347
00:29:59,018 --> 00:30:01,019
- Leave me alone.
- Dead, Mrs. Lampert.

348
00:30:01,103 --> 00:30:03,354
Like last week's news.
Like Charles, Mrs. Lampert.

349
00:30:03,439 --> 00:30:05,523
Stop it!

350
00:30:07,526 --> 00:30:09,861
- What's the trouble?
- He stepped on my foot.

351
00:30:09,945 --> 00:30:12,155
- Forgive me.
- Wait here. I won't be long.

352
00:30:12,239 --> 00:30:14,491
It was quite unintentional, I'm sure.

353
00:30:33,844 --> 00:30:35,762
Mr. Bartholomew, this is Regina Lampert.

354
00:30:35,846 --> 00:30:41,059
Mr. Bartholomew, I just saw one of those m -
Mr. Bartholomew, can you hear me?

355
00:30:43,145 --> 00:30:45,980
Mr. Bartholomew,
this is Regina Lampert. I just -

356
00:30:51,904 --> 00:30:54,072
- Howdy.
- What do you want?

357
00:30:54,156 --> 00:30:57,784
- You must be kiddin'.
- No, I'm not.

358
00:30:57,868 --> 00:31:00,203
Come on now, Miz Lampert.

359
00:31:00,287 --> 00:31:03,540
You know what it is,
and you're gonna get it for me, too.

360
00:31:03,624 --> 00:31:06,751
'Cause you know
I ain't foolin' around here.

361
00:31:11,298 --> 00:31:13,216
No sirree, Bob.

362
00:31:14,843 --> 00:31:18,096
- Stop that, please!
- Don't make too much noise, Miz Lampert.

363
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:22,350
It could get a whole lot worse, you know.

364
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:28,231
It belongs to me, Miz Lampert,
and you're gonna get it for me...

365
00:31:28,315 --> 00:31:32,360
or your life ain't gonna be worth
the paper it's printed on.

366
00:31:32,444 --> 00:31:35,905
- You "savez" what I'm sayin' to you?
- Stop! Stop! Please stop!

367
00:31:35,990 --> 00:31:39,951
- You go home and think it over
real careful like, you hear?
- You're absolutely insane!

368
00:31:49,878 --> 00:31:52,297
What's the matter?

369
00:31:52,381 --> 00:31:54,716
What are you doing in here?

370
00:31:55,884 --> 00:31:58,344
I'm having a nervous breakdown.

371
00:32:10,524 --> 00:32:13,901
Now hold it. I've waited long enough.
What happened back there?

372
00:32:13,986 --> 00:32:18,573
- I'm not sure if I'm supposed to tell you or not.
- What does that mean?

373
00:32:18,657 --> 00:32:23,411
He said if I told anybody
it could prove fatal for them as well as for me.

374
00:32:23,495 --> 00:32:26,164
- Who said?
- That's what I'm not supposed to say.

375
00:32:26,248 --> 00:32:28,916
Eh -

376
00:32:29,001 --> 00:32:33,379
- Now stop that nonsense.
- Stop bullying me. Everybody's bullying me.

377
00:32:33,464 --> 00:32:36,674
- I'm not bullying you.
- Yes, you were. You said it was nonsense.

378
00:32:36,759 --> 00:32:39,886
Being murdered in cold blood
is not nonsense.

379
00:32:39,970 --> 00:32:42,430
Why don't you try it sometime?

380
00:32:44,224 --> 00:32:47,685
- Would you mind seeing me to the door?
- Of course not.

381
00:32:49,313 --> 00:32:51,689
It's a good place for making friends.

382
00:32:54,777 --> 00:32:58,446
You said this afternoon your husband
was mixed up in something.

383
00:32:58,530 --> 00:33:00,531
How do you shave in there?

384
00:33:00,616 --> 00:33:02,533
What was it?

385
00:33:02,618 --> 00:33:05,787
- What was what?
- What your husband was mixed up in.

386
00:33:05,871 --> 00:33:08,623
Look, I know it's asking you
to stretch your imagination, but...

387
00:33:08,707 --> 00:33:11,709
don't you think you could pretend
just for a moment that I'm a woman?

388
00:33:11,794 --> 00:33:15,838
I could already be arrested for transporting
a minor above the first floor.

389
00:33:18,092 --> 00:33:20,551
- Here you are.
- Where?

390
00:33:20,636 --> 00:33:23,888
- On the street where you live.
- How about once more around the park?

391
00:33:23,972 --> 00:33:26,641
How about getting out of here?
Come on, child. Out.

392
00:33:28,936 --> 00:33:31,979
- Won't you come in for a minute?
- No, I won't.

393
00:33:33,315 --> 00:33:37,694
I don't bite, you know,
unless it's called for.

394
00:33:37,778 --> 00:33:41,739
- How would you like a spanking?
- How'd you like a punch in the nose?

395
00:33:41,824 --> 00:33:46,744
- Stop treating me like a child.
- Well then, stop behaving like one.

396
00:33:46,829 --> 00:33:48,871
If you want to tell me
what's troubling you, fine.

397
00:33:48,956 --> 00:33:51,499
If not, I'm tired,
it's late and I want to go home to bed.

398
00:33:52,584 --> 00:33:54,502
Oh -

399
00:33:54,586 --> 00:33:56,796
Do you know what's wrong with you?

400
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:59,340
No. What?

401
00:33:59,425 --> 00:34:01,342
Nothing.

402
00:34:12,521 --> 00:34:14,772
Where is it, lady?

403
00:34:14,857 --> 00:34:16,774
I don't know.

404
00:34:25,033 --> 00:34:27,034
I want it.

405
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:29,704
You give it to me.

406
00:34:29,788 --> 00:34:32,623
It's mine!

407
00:34:34,209 --> 00:34:36,878
Peter! Peter!

408
00:34:36,962 --> 00:34:39,672
- A man tried to kill me!
- What?

409
00:35:03,530 --> 00:35:08,576
Peter?

410
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:11,829
Peter, are you all right?

411
00:35:11,914 --> 00:35:15,458
Oh, Peter. Are you hurt?

412
00:35:15,542 --> 00:35:17,835
Mm-hmm.
I sprained my pride.

413
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:20,087
How are you?

414
00:35:20,172 --> 00:35:23,174
- Scared.
- You'll be all right.

415
00:35:23,258 --> 00:35:26,761
- Where did he go?
- Out the window, I guess.

416
00:35:26,845 --> 00:35:29,806
Lock the door,
and don't let anyone in except me.

417
00:35:29,890 --> 00:35:33,476
- And close these windows after me.
- Be careful.

418
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:35,728
You took the words
right out of my mouth.

419
00:35:59,837 --> 00:36:01,754
Alistair!

420
00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:05,466
- What is it now, Pamela?
- It happened again.

421
00:36:05,551 --> 00:36:10,012
Another strange man peered
in the window at me but then went away.

422
00:36:10,097 --> 00:36:12,181
Bad luck, Pamela.

423
00:36:32,494 --> 00:36:35,746
- That was a dumb move, Herman.
- Oh, man. And then some.

424
00:36:35,831 --> 00:36:38,207
If you'd let us known
you was goin' to her room...

425
00:36:38,292 --> 00:36:40,209
we could have done somethin'
to keep him busy.

426
00:36:40,294 --> 00:36:43,754
But sneakin' up thataway by yourself.

427
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:46,215
What did you expect him to do?

428
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:51,262
- Walk up and shake you by that hand of yours?
- A dumb move, Herman. A dumb move.

429
00:36:51,346 --> 00:36:54,932
Yes, it was a dumb move, Herman.
What is the matter with you?

430
00:36:55,017 --> 00:36:59,186
- You want some more?
- Never mind that. Did you get the money?

431
00:36:59,271 --> 00:37:03,524
How could I with the three Marx Brothers
breathing down my neck?

432
00:37:03,609 --> 00:37:06,193
I thought we had an agreement.

433
00:37:07,821 --> 00:37:09,739
Now, the girl trusts me.

434
00:37:09,823 --> 00:37:13,117
If she's got the money, I'll find out about it.
But you just leave me alone.

435
00:37:13,201 --> 00:37:18,289
We took all the chances.
The money belongs to us, not to him.

436
00:37:18,373 --> 00:37:21,626
Now, don't be piggy, Herman.

437
00:37:21,710 --> 00:37:25,463
A third of nothing is nothing.
Just think about that.

438
00:37:25,547 --> 00:37:28,925
But make up your mind.
She's waiting for me.

439
00:37:29,009 --> 00:37:32,053
I don't see how another 24 hours
could hurt anything.

440
00:37:32,137 --> 00:37:34,305
Shoot, no.
Not after all these years.

441
00:37:34,389 --> 00:37:38,184
Then he gets it out of your share.

442
00:37:38,268 --> 00:37:45,024
Not mine.

443
00:37:46,193 --> 00:37:48,736
Either one of you
got the room next to her?

444
00:37:48,820 --> 00:37:50,738
Yeah, I have. Why?

445
00:37:50,822 --> 00:37:53,616
Give me the key.
Get another room. I want to use it.

446
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:55,701
Hmm.

447
00:38:00,999 --> 00:38:04,085
If you do find that money...

448
00:38:04,169 --> 00:38:07,171
you ain't gonna forget
to tell your buddies about it, are ya?

449
00:38:07,255 --> 00:38:11,550
- Don't worry.
- Oh, no, I ain't worryin'.

450
00:38:11,635 --> 00:38:14,053
You see this little fella here?

451
00:38:14,137 --> 00:38:16,806
Oh, he worries.

452
00:38:16,890 --> 00:38:19,100
And he's even meaner than I am.

453
00:38:41,623 --> 00:38:44,625
- Who is it?
- It's me, Peter.

454
00:39:02,310 --> 00:39:04,437
There was no trace of him.

455
00:39:05,981 --> 00:39:09,692
Why don't you confide in me
and tell me what this is all about?

456
00:39:11,486 --> 00:39:14,238
There are three men.
He's one of them.

457
00:39:14,322 --> 00:39:17,825
They think I have a quarter of a million
dollars that belongs to them.

458
00:39:20,662 --> 00:39:23,414
- Go on.
- That's all.

459
00:39:23,498 --> 00:39:27,084
- No, it isn't. Where's the money?
- I don't know.

460
00:39:27,169 --> 00:39:31,422
They killed Charles to get it,
but he must not have had it with him on the train.

461
00:39:31,506 --> 00:39:33,924
- So they think he left it with you.
- But he didn't.

462
00:39:34,009 --> 00:39:37,261
I've looked everywhere,
and if I don't find it they're going to kill me.

463
00:39:39,014 --> 00:39:41,265
No, they won't.
I won't let them.

464
00:39:42,559 --> 00:39:45,478
Peter, help me.
You're the only one I can trust.

465
00:39:46,521 --> 00:39:49,482
I'll help you.

466
00:39:49,566 --> 00:39:51,609
I told you I would. Come on.

467
00:39:51,693 --> 00:39:55,071
Oh, I'm so hungry I could faint.

468
00:39:55,155 --> 00:39:57,698
And I've gotten your suit all wet.

469
00:39:57,783 --> 00:40:01,786
That's all right. It's a drip-dry.

470
00:40:01,870 --> 00:40:04,288
Wipe your eyes.

471
00:40:05,832 --> 00:40:08,292
Promise me you'll never lie to me
the way Charles did.

472
00:40:08,376 --> 00:40:11,170
Why do people have to tell lies?

473
00:40:11,254 --> 00:40:15,925
Usually it's because they want something.
They're afraid the truth won't get it.

474
00:40:16,009 --> 00:40:19,220
Do you tell lies?

475
00:40:27,729 --> 00:40:30,314
- Hello?
- Mrs. Lampert, it's me...

476
00:40:30,398 --> 00:40:33,234
the man who was in your room
a few minutes ago.

477
00:40:34,569 --> 00:40:36,821
- What do you want?
- Who is it?

478
00:40:36,905 --> 00:40:39,115
It's the man you had the fight with.

479
00:40:39,199 --> 00:40:42,284
- Is Dyle with you?
- Who?

480
00:40:42,369 --> 00:40:46,831
The man I had the fight with, lady.
Dyle. That's his name.

481
00:40:46,915 --> 00:40:49,542
What's wrong?
Is he still there?

482
00:40:53,672 --> 00:40:58,676
- Yes, that's right.
- What's he saying?

483
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:02,847
Don't trust him.
Don't tell him anything.

484
00:41:02,931 --> 00:41:05,141
He's after the money.

485
00:41:13,358 --> 00:41:15,276
What was all that about?

486
00:41:16,778 --> 00:41:18,696
He -

487
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:22,825
- He said if I don't give him the money he'll kill me.
- Oh, don't take it seriously.

488
00:41:23,910 --> 00:41:26,912
He's just trying to frighten you.

489
00:41:26,997 --> 00:41:30,332
- I believe what he said.
- No, no. It's just a lot of words.

490
00:41:30,417 --> 00:41:32,751
Words can hurt.

491
00:41:32,836 --> 00:41:34,712
I know.

492
00:41:34,796 --> 00:41:37,756
Try to get some sleep.
You'll feel better.

493
00:41:37,841 --> 00:41:42,386
Don't worry. I've arranged
to take the room next door to you.

494
00:41:44,306 --> 00:41:46,640
So you'll be all right.

495
00:41:46,725 --> 00:41:49,059
If you want anything,
just bang on the wall.

496
00:41:49,144 --> 00:41:51,729
Better lock the door after me.

497
00:41:51,813 --> 00:41:54,565
Good night.

498
00:42:22,928 --> 00:42:26,263
But I am calm, Mr. Bartholomew.
What I'm trying to say is that -

499
00:42:26,348 --> 00:42:28,224
is that there's someone else.

500
00:42:28,350 --> 00:42:31,352
- What?
- Someone who wasn't in that photograph
you showed me today.

501
00:42:31,436 --> 00:42:34,855
He says his name is Peter Joshua,
but it isn't. It's Dyle.

502
00:42:36,650 --> 00:42:40,194
- Are you still there, Mr. Bartholomew?
- Yes, yes, Mrs. Lampert.

503
00:42:40,278 --> 00:42:43,155
Uh, I don't know who this Mr. Dyle is...

504
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:46,283
but it's possible we were wrong
about who killed your husband.

505
00:42:46,368 --> 00:42:49,578
You mean... he might have?

506
00:42:50,747 --> 00:42:53,123
Mr. Bartholomew,
I'm catching the next plane out of here.

507
00:42:53,208 --> 00:42:56,293
I'm not going to sit around for somebody
to make chopped liver out of me.

508
00:42:56,378 --> 00:42:59,672
Now, take it easy, Mrs. Lampert.
Take it easy.

509
00:42:59,756 --> 00:43:02,675
Uh, where are you now?
Can you meet me at the market?

510
00:43:02,759 --> 00:43:05,761
- At Les Halles?
- Yes. Opposite Saint-Eustache.

511
00:43:05,845 --> 00:43:09,556
- I'll meet you there in 15 minutes.
- All right. I'll be there in 15 minutes.

512
00:43:56,771 --> 00:43:59,773
Allez vite, n'importe oГ№.
N'importe oГ№! Vite!

513
00:44:08,658 --> 00:44:10,617
Suivez ce taxi.

514
00:44:15,749 --> 00:44:20,169
- Were you followed?
- Yes, by Dyle. But I lost him.

515
00:44:20,253 --> 00:44:22,713
I'm beginning to think
women make the best spies.

516
00:44:22,797 --> 00:44:24,715
Agents.

517
00:44:24,799 --> 00:44:27,926
- He has a gun, Mr. Bartholomew.
- No.

518
00:44:28,011 --> 00:44:31,221
- But I saw it.
- No, that's not Carson Dyle.

519
00:44:31,306 --> 00:44:34,892
- Carson?
- There's only one Dyle connected
with this affair, Mrs. Lampert.

520
00:44:34,976 --> 00:44:36,894
That's Carson Dyle.

521
00:44:36,978 --> 00:44:39,146
You mean you've known
about him all along?

522
00:44:40,148 --> 00:44:42,858
It's enough to make you
a vegetarian, isn't it?

523
00:44:43,818 --> 00:44:47,780
It's just lucky I'm not hanging
next to one of those things right now.

524
00:44:49,407 --> 00:44:51,742
Why didn't you tell me
you knew about Dyle?

525
00:44:51,826 --> 00:44:53,994
I didn't see any point.
Dyle's dead.

526
00:44:56,289 --> 00:44:58,499
Mr. Bartholomew,
what is all this about?

527
00:44:58,583 --> 00:45:03,545
In 1944, five members of the O.S.S. -

528
00:45:03,630 --> 00:45:05,923
the military espionage unit -

529
00:45:06,007 --> 00:45:08,175
were ordered behind the German lines...

530
00:45:08,259 --> 00:45:13,680
for the purpose of delivering
$250,000 in gold...

531
00:45:13,765 --> 00:45:16,225
to the French underground.

532
00:45:16,309 --> 00:45:18,685
The five men were, of course,
your husband Charles...

533
00:45:18,770 --> 00:45:21,438
the three men who showed up
at his funeral yesterday...

534
00:45:21,523 --> 00:45:23,816
and Carson Dyle.

535
00:45:23,900 --> 00:45:28,153
- Oh.
- But instead of delivering the gold, they stole it.

536
00:45:28,238 --> 00:45:30,697
- How?
- By burying it...

537
00:45:30,782 --> 00:45:33,575
then reporting
the Germans had captured it.

538
00:45:33,660 --> 00:45:35,953
All they had to do was
come back after the war...

539
00:45:36,037 --> 00:45:38,622
dig it up and split it five ways.

540
00:45:38,706 --> 00:45:43,085
Quarter of a million dollars
with no questions asked.

541
00:45:43,169 --> 00:45:45,462
May I have a cigarette, please?

542
00:45:46,548 --> 00:45:48,632
I can't stand those things.

543
00:45:48,716 --> 00:45:51,635
It's like drinking coffee through a veil.

544
00:45:51,719 --> 00:45:55,931
Everything went smoothly enough
until after the gold was buried.

545
00:45:56,015 --> 00:46:00,227
Before they could get out,
they were ambushed by a German patrol.

546
00:46:00,311 --> 00:46:03,730
A machine gun separated
Scobie from his right hand...

547
00:46:03,815 --> 00:46:06,817
and caught Carson Dyle
full in the stomach.

548
00:46:10,405 --> 00:46:12,656
What was wrong with that one?

549
00:46:12,740 --> 00:46:15,576
Nothing, I guess.
What happened then?

550
00:46:15,660 --> 00:46:19,705
- Have you any idea what these
things cost over here?
- Please go on, Mr. Bartholomew.

551
00:46:19,789 --> 00:46:21,748
What happened then?

552
00:46:23,918 --> 00:46:29,339
Carson Dyle was dead,
but Scobie was able to travel. So -

553
00:46:29,424 --> 00:46:32,384
- La soupe, c'est pour qui?
- Pour moi.

554
00:46:41,936 --> 00:46:43,854
Where was I?

555
00:46:43,938 --> 00:46:46,356
- Carson Dyle was dead.
- Yes. Carson Dyle was dead.

556
00:46:46,441 --> 00:46:49,568
The others finally got back to the base
and waited for the war to end...

557
00:46:49,652 --> 00:46:52,488
only Charles couldn't wait
quite as long as the others.

558
00:46:52,572 --> 00:46:56,325
He beat them back to the gold,
took everything for himself and disappeared.

559
00:46:56,409 --> 00:47:00,204
It's taken Gideon, Tex and Scobie all this time
to catch up with him again.

560
00:47:00,288 --> 00:47:04,208
But if they stole all that money,
why can't you arrest them?

561
00:47:04,292 --> 00:47:06,668
Shh.

562
00:47:06,753 --> 00:47:10,797
We know what happened from the bits and pieces
we were able to paste together...

563
00:47:10,882 --> 00:47:13,091
but we still have no proof.

564
00:47:13,176 --> 00:47:15,802
What's this got to do with the C.I.O.?

565
00:47:19,766 --> 00:47:22,768
C.I.A., Mrs. Lampert.

566
00:47:22,852 --> 00:47:26,230
It's an extension of the wartime O.S.S.

567
00:47:26,314 --> 00:47:28,357
It's our money, and we want it back.

568
00:47:28,441 --> 00:47:32,236
I'm sorry, Mr. Bartholomew,
but nothing you've said has changed my mind.

569
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:34,446
I'm leaving Paris tonight.

570
00:47:35,532 --> 00:47:38,158
Wouldn't advise that, Mrs. Lampert.

571
00:47:38,243 --> 00:47:41,578
Better consider what happened
to your husband when he tried to leave.

572
00:47:41,663 --> 00:47:44,331
Those men won't be very far away
no matter where you go.

573
00:47:44,415 --> 00:47:47,292
In fact, I don't even see any point
in your changing hotels.

574
00:47:47,377 --> 00:47:50,087
Now, please help us, Mrs. Lampert.

575
00:47:50,171 --> 00:47:52,756
Your government is counting on you.

576
00:47:55,093 --> 00:47:58,262
Well, if I'm going to die,
I might as well do it for my country.

577
00:47:58,346 --> 00:48:01,598
That's the spirit.
Here's what I want you to do.

578
00:48:01,683 --> 00:48:05,269
We're anxious to know who this man is -
the one calling himself Dyle.

579
00:48:05,353 --> 00:48:07,229
I want you to find out.

580
00:48:07,313 --> 00:48:09,606
Why me?

581
00:48:09,691 --> 00:48:12,359
You're in an ideal position.
He trusts you.

582
00:48:12,443 --> 00:48:17,906
Besides, you yourself said
women make the best spies.

583
00:48:17,991 --> 00:48:20,617
Agents.

584
00:48:32,380 --> 00:48:34,381
Oh, pardon.

585
00:48:57,655 --> 00:49:01,158
- FrГ¤ulein. FrГ¤ulein.
- What are you doing following me?

586
00:49:01,242 --> 00:49:05,245
It's gonna look like a parade. Stop it.

587
00:49:11,586 --> 00:49:13,920
How are you? Nice to see you.
When did you arrive?

588
00:49:14,005 --> 00:49:17,174
It's a lovely town. Are you having a good time?
So many things to see.

589
00:49:23,264 --> 00:49:24,973
FrГ¤ulein.

590
00:49:25,058 --> 00:49:26,975
FrГ¤ulein!

591
00:49:27,060 --> 00:49:29,770
If you don't stop following me,
I'll call the police.

592
00:49:31,898 --> 00:49:33,690
Taxi!

593
00:49:56,839 --> 00:49:58,924
Dyle, pIease. D-Y-L-E.

594
00:49:59,008 --> 00:50:01,009
Yes, Mr. Dyle. I remember.

595
00:50:05,890 --> 00:50:09,893
- No, I'm sorry, Mr. Dyle. Nothing today.
- Thank you.

596
00:50:09,977 --> 00:50:13,230
Mr. Dyle, pIease.
You're wanted on the telephone.

597
00:50:13,314 --> 00:50:15,357
Mr. Dyle. Cabin four.

598
00:50:15,441 --> 00:50:17,776
Mr. Dyle. Cabin four, pIease.

599
00:50:25,326 --> 00:50:29,246
- Yes?
- Good morning, Mr. Dyle.

600
00:50:30,832 --> 00:50:33,750
- Reggie?
- It's the only name I've got. How about you?

601
00:50:33,835 --> 00:50:36,336
No cat and mouse. You've got me.
What do you want to know?

602
00:50:36,421 --> 00:50:38,588
Why you lied to me.

603
00:50:38,673 --> 00:50:41,675
I had to. For all I knew,
you were in on the whole thing.

604
00:50:41,759 --> 00:50:45,429
- I'm trying to find out who you are.
- You know my name. It's Dyle.

605
00:50:45,513 --> 00:50:47,431
Carson Dyle is dead.

606
00:50:47,515 --> 00:50:49,891
Yes, he is.
He was my brother.

607
00:50:51,394 --> 00:50:53,270
Your brother?

608
00:50:53,354 --> 00:50:56,440
The army thinks he was
killed in action by the Germans...

609
00:50:56,524 --> 00:51:00,610
but I think they did it -
Tex, Gideon, Scobie and your husband -

610
00:51:00,695 --> 00:51:04,114
because my brother wouldn't
go along with their scheme to steal the gold.

611
00:51:04,198 --> 00:51:06,450
I think he threatened
to turn them in and they killed him.

612
00:51:06,534 --> 00:51:11,580
I'm trying to prove it. They think
I'm working with them, but I'm not, Reggie.

613
00:51:11,664 --> 00:51:13,790
I'm on your side.
Just believe that.

614
00:51:13,875 --> 00:51:16,835
How can I? You lied to me
just the way Charles did.

615
00:51:16,919 --> 00:51:18,837
After promising you wouldn't.

616
00:51:18,921 --> 00:51:21,465
Oh, I want to believe you, Peter -

617
00:51:21,549 --> 00:51:23,467
I can't call you that anymore, can I?

618
00:51:23,551 --> 00:51:27,512
Take me a while to get used to
your new name. What is it?

619
00:51:28,556 --> 00:51:30,557
Hmm? Hello?

620
00:51:32,059 --> 00:51:34,060
Hello?

621
00:51:46,949 --> 00:51:49,993
Do anything funny or try to
talk to anyone and I'll kill you, Dyle.

622
00:51:50,077 --> 00:51:52,287
You'll wreck your raincoat.

623
00:51:53,372 --> 00:51:55,290
Take the next car, please.

624
00:52:13,142 --> 00:52:16,228
Look out.
Didn't want you to bump your head.

625
00:52:18,105 --> 00:52:20,774
All right, get in there.

626
00:52:30,451 --> 00:52:32,452
All right, turn around.

627
00:52:41,295 --> 00:52:43,797
Now sit down.

628
00:52:54,642 --> 00:52:58,603
- Now what?
- We wait. With our mouth shut.

629
00:53:07,446 --> 00:53:09,489
Oh, I'm sorry about that.

630
00:53:20,501 --> 00:53:23,461
Okay. Up there.

631
00:53:32,179 --> 00:53:35,432
- Do I knock or something?
- No, open it...

632
00:53:35,516 --> 00:53:37,976
and keep right on goin'.

633
00:53:38,060 --> 00:53:40,604
The view had better be worth it.

634
00:53:54,744 --> 00:53:56,745
Very pretty. Now what?

635
00:53:59,707 --> 00:54:01,875
I was afraid of that.

636
00:54:06,255 --> 00:54:10,717
I'll give you a chance, Dyle,
which is more than you'd give me.

637
00:54:11,761 --> 00:54:13,762
Where's the money?

638
00:54:15,056 --> 00:54:19,100
Is that why you dragged me all the way
up here? To ask me that?

639
00:54:19,185 --> 00:54:23,313
- She has it.
- And I say maybe you both have it.

640
00:54:23,397 --> 00:54:27,859
One more time, Dyle.
Where is it?

641
00:54:27,944 --> 00:54:32,322
Supposing I had it -
which I don't -

642
00:54:32,406 --> 00:54:35,742
do you really think
I'd just hand it over to you?

643
00:54:38,704 --> 00:54:40,622
Step back.

644
00:54:43,584 --> 00:54:45,502
Back where?

645
00:54:45,586 --> 00:54:48,296
That's the idea.

646
00:54:48,381 --> 00:54:53,259
Hmm. Now - Now, just a minute.
Take it easy.

647
00:56:38,407 --> 00:56:42,494
- Herman?
- What?

648
00:56:44,872 --> 00:56:48,291
- How you doing?
- How do you think?

649
00:56:48,375 --> 00:56:53,338
If you get bored, try writing "Love thy neighbor"
100 times on the side of the building.

650
00:57:04,141 --> 00:57:09,145
Monsieur, next time, please,
use the keyhole, hmm?

651
00:57:21,325 --> 00:57:23,243
- Is that you?
- Yeah.

652
00:57:24,578 --> 00:57:28,039
- You gonna open up?
- Sure. Wait a minute.

653
00:57:28,124 --> 00:57:32,377
Don't you know it's impolite
to leave someone holding... the phone?

654
00:57:32,461 --> 00:57:34,379
What happened?

655
00:57:34,463 --> 00:57:36,881
Oh, I met a man with sharp nails.

656
00:57:38,968 --> 00:57:41,052
- Scobie?
- Mm-hmm.

657
00:57:41,137 --> 00:57:44,848
I left him hanging around
the American Express.

658
00:57:44,932 --> 00:57:47,851
Come in. I've got something
that stings like crazy.

659
00:57:47,935 --> 00:57:50,854
You're the kind of girl
that'd have something like that.

660
00:57:50,938 --> 00:57:52,856
Sit down.

661
00:57:52,940 --> 00:57:54,858
Uh, w-w-wait a minute.

662
00:57:54,942 --> 00:57:56,860
- W-W-What is that stuff?
- Marvelous stuff.

663
00:57:56,944 --> 00:57:59,863
- Gonna hurt you much more
than it's gonna hurt me.
- I'll bet -

664
00:57:59,947 --> 00:58:02,365
Oh! Did you hear something rip?

665
00:58:02,449 --> 00:58:04,993
- No.
- Oh. That's odd.

666
00:58:07,079 --> 00:58:09,998
Listen, I-I only came in for an estimate.

667
00:58:10,082 --> 00:58:12,500
Sit still. It's not too bad.

668
00:58:12,585 --> 00:58:15,420
You won't be able to
lie on your back for a few days.

669
00:58:15,504 --> 00:58:18,423
- But then, you can lie from any position, can't you?
- Oh-ho-ho -

670
00:58:18,507 --> 00:58:20,425
- Ooh!
- Does it hurt?

671
00:58:20,509 --> 00:58:22,427
- What?
- Does it hurt?

672
00:58:22,511 --> 00:58:24,429
Oh. Are you kidding?

673
00:58:24,513 --> 00:58:27,390
Have you got a bullet I could bite,
like they do in the movies?

674
00:58:27,474 --> 00:58:30,351
Are you really Carson Dyle's brother?

675
00:58:30,436 --> 00:58:32,812
Would you like to see my passport?

676
00:58:32,897 --> 00:58:35,440
Passport?
What kind of a proof is that?

677
00:58:35,524 --> 00:58:38,693
- Well, would you like to see where I was tattooed?
- Yes.

678
00:58:38,777 --> 00:58:41,196
All right.
We'll drive around that way.

679
00:58:43,282 --> 00:58:47,202
You could at least tell me
what your first name is these days.

680
00:58:47,286 --> 00:58:50,038
Alexander.

681
00:58:50,122 --> 00:58:52,040
Okay, Alexander.

682
00:58:52,124 --> 00:58:54,042
- You're done.
- Good.

683
00:58:54,126 --> 00:58:56,544
You're a new man.

684
00:58:56,629 --> 00:58:59,547
I'm sorry the old one
couldn't tell you the truth...

685
00:58:59,632 --> 00:59:03,092
but I had to find out
your part in all this.

686
00:59:03,177 --> 00:59:05,094
Is there a Mrs. Dyle?

687
00:59:05,179 --> 00:59:07,096
Yes.

688
00:59:07,181 --> 00:59:09,557
But we're divorced.

689
00:59:09,642 --> 00:59:11,768
I thought that was Peter Joshua.

690
00:59:11,852 --> 00:59:14,729
I'm just as difficult
to Iive with as he was.

691
00:59:16,023 --> 00:59:18,983
Alex, how can you tell
if anyone's lying or not?

692
00:59:20,110 --> 00:59:22,528
- You can't.
- There must be some way.

693
00:59:22,613 --> 00:59:25,531
There's an old riddle about
two tribes of Indians.

694
00:59:25,616 --> 00:59:28,660
The Whitefeet always tell the truth,
and the Blackfeet always lie.

695
00:59:28,744 --> 00:59:30,662
One day you meet an Indian.
You say...

696
00:59:30,746 --> 00:59:34,666
"Hey, Indian, what are you,
a truthful Whitefoot or a lying Blackfoot?"

697
00:59:34,750 --> 00:59:37,835
He says, "I'm a truthful Whitefoot."
But which is he?

698
00:59:40,297 --> 00:59:42,715
Why couldn't you just look at his feet?

699
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:44,592
Because he's wearing moccasins.

700
00:59:44,677 --> 00:59:47,095
Well, then, he's a truthful Whitefoot,
of course.

701
00:59:47,179 --> 00:59:48,846
Why not a lying Blackfoot?

702
00:59:50,224 --> 00:59:54,018
- Which one are you?
- A truthful Whitefoot.

703
00:59:55,729 --> 00:59:57,814
Come in.

704
00:59:57,898 --> 01:00:00,316
- Sit down.
- Why? Do you wanna look at my feet?

705
01:00:00,401 --> 01:00:02,610
Yes.

706
01:00:04,154 --> 01:00:07,615
Uh-oh. Ohh. Hey, knock it off.
Come on, Reggie. Listen to me.

707
01:00:07,700 --> 01:00:09,617
Here it comes, the fatherly talk.

708
01:00:09,702 --> 01:00:12,829
- You forget I'm already a widow.
- So was Juliet, at 15.

709
01:00:12,913 --> 01:00:16,165
- But I'm not 15.
- Well, that's your trouble. You're too old for me.

710
01:00:16,250 --> 01:00:19,502
- Can't you be serious?
- Oh! You just said an horrible word.

711
01:00:19,586 --> 01:00:22,005
- What did I say?
- Serious.

712
01:00:22,089 --> 01:00:25,550
When I man gets to be my age,
that's the last word he ever wants to hear.

713
01:00:25,634 --> 01:00:29,595
I don't want to be serious,
and I especially don't want you to be.

714
01:00:29,680 --> 01:00:34,100
Okay, we'll just sit around all day long
being frivolous. How about that, hmm?

715
01:00:34,184 --> 01:00:36,644
Reggie, cut it out.

716
01:00:37,730 --> 01:00:39,647
Okay.

717
01:00:39,732 --> 01:00:42,191
- Now what are you doing?
- Cutting it out.

718
01:00:42,276 --> 01:00:44,610
- Who told you to do that?
- You did.

719
01:00:44,695 --> 01:00:46,779
I'm not through complaining yet.

720
01:00:46,864 --> 01:00:48,781
Oh.

721
01:00:51,618 --> 01:00:54,954
- Now cut it out.
- Alex, I think I love you.

722
01:00:59,460 --> 01:01:01,544
Hey, the telephone's ringing.

723
01:01:01,628 --> 01:01:03,546
Never mind.

724
01:01:03,630 --> 01:01:06,549
Whoever it is won't give up,
and neither will I.

725
01:01:06,633 --> 01:01:08,551
Just a minute.
Go on, take it.

726
01:01:10,637 --> 01:01:13,097
Hello.

727
01:01:13,182 --> 01:01:16,351
I'm sorry, uh -
I was just, uh -

728
01:01:16,435 --> 01:01:18,353
nibbling on something.

729
01:01:18,437 --> 01:01:20,355
Say, I'd appreciate it mighty highly...

730
01:01:20,439 --> 01:01:24,359
if you'd, uh, wiggle on over to Room 46
and chew the fat for a spell.

731
01:01:24,443 --> 01:01:26,694
Could you give me
one good reason why I should?

732
01:01:26,779 --> 01:01:31,366
Yeah. A little one, about six or seven.

733
01:01:31,450 --> 01:01:33,659
Keeps callin' for Aunt Reggie.

734
01:01:33,744 --> 01:01:36,371
Ain't that cute?

735
01:01:36,455 --> 01:01:38,831
They've got Jean-Louis.

736
01:01:40,042 --> 01:01:42,668
I'll be right there.

737
01:01:45,089 --> 01:01:49,008
Hey, Tex, do somethin' with this kid, will ya?
My leg's goin' to sleep.

738
01:01:49,093 --> 01:01:51,677
Upsy-daisy.

739
01:01:51,762 --> 01:01:53,679
Are you a real cowboy?

740
01:01:53,764 --> 01:01:55,681
Yeah, sure I am, kid.

741
01:01:55,766 --> 01:01:57,683
So where's your gun?

742
01:02:01,188 --> 01:02:03,773
Will you put that thing away!

743
01:02:03,857 --> 01:02:05,775
Jean-Louis.

744
01:02:05,859 --> 01:02:07,860
Howdy, Miz Lampert.

745
01:02:08,904 --> 01:02:10,863
Who invited him?

746
01:02:10,948 --> 01:02:13,282
Well, Herman, I see
you had a happy landing.

747
01:02:13,367 --> 01:02:15,284
I must call Sylvie right away.

748
01:02:15,369 --> 01:02:18,287
- I'm afraid that'll have to wait, Mrs. Lampert.
- It's his mother.

749
01:02:18,372 --> 01:02:21,541
She won't be anybody's mother
unless you answer some questions.

750
01:02:21,625 --> 01:02:24,710
- This ain't no game, Miz Lampert.
- We want that money now.

751
01:02:24,795 --> 01:02:28,131
Why don't you keep quiet and
stop threatening the child.

752
01:02:28,215 --> 01:02:31,843
He hasn't got the money,
and neither has Mrs. Lampert.

753
01:02:31,927 --> 01:02:33,219
Then who does?

754
01:02:33,303 --> 01:02:36,305
I don't know, Herman.
Maybe you do.

755
01:02:36,390 --> 01:02:38,099
Me?

756
01:02:38,183 --> 01:02:41,018
- Or you.
- Ohh.

757
01:02:41,103 --> 01:02:44,313
- Or him.
- Why, that's the most ridiculous thing I ever -

758
01:02:44,398 --> 01:02:47,316
- Listen to this man.
- Man's gone loco.

759
01:02:47,401 --> 01:02:52,113
Now hoId it. Suppose one of you
found Charles here in Paris.

760
01:02:52,197 --> 01:02:54,115
Even bumped into him by accident...

761
01:02:54,199 --> 01:02:57,743
followed him when he tried to run out again,
cornered him on the train...

762
01:02:57,828 --> 01:03:00,705
threw him out the window and,
without bothering to tell the other two...

763
01:03:00,789 --> 01:03:02,748
took all the money for yourself.

764
01:03:02,833 --> 01:03:06,294
If one of us did that, he wouldn't hang around
waiting for the other two to figure it out.

765
01:03:06,378 --> 01:03:10,256
But he'd have to. Don't you see?
If he left, he'd be admitting his guilt.

766
01:03:10,340 --> 01:03:13,301
Whoever it is has to wait here
pretending to look for the money...

767
01:03:13,385 --> 01:03:16,512
waiting for the rest of us
to give up and go home.

768
01:03:16,597 --> 01:03:19,849
He's just tryin' to throw us off.
They got it, I tell ya.

769
01:03:19,933 --> 01:03:22,351
Why don't we search their rooms?

770
01:03:23,437 --> 01:03:25,354
That's all right with us.

771
01:03:25,439 --> 01:03:28,858
Then what are we wastin' time for?
Let's go.

772
01:03:28,942 --> 01:03:31,777
- While we're waiting, we'll search yours.
- Not my room.

773
01:03:31,862 --> 01:03:35,823
Well, Herman.
You have something to hide?

774
01:03:37,534 --> 01:03:40,203
Then there are no objections.

775
01:03:40,287 --> 01:03:42,205
All right, here's my key.

776
01:03:42,289 --> 01:03:44,957
- I'll take that.
- My room's open.

777
01:03:45,042 --> 01:03:46,959
Everyone. Whoa.
Come on.

778
01:03:49,213 --> 01:03:52,131
Now, you two
just make yourselves to home here.

779
01:03:53,967 --> 01:03:55,885
Well, let's get busy.

780
01:03:55,969 --> 01:03:59,388
Come on, Jean-Louis.
Come along. Oh, that's fine.

781
01:03:59,473 --> 01:04:02,391
- Who gets your vote?
- Scobie. He's the one who objected.

782
01:04:02,476 --> 01:04:05,394
All right,
I'll take Tex's room here and Gideon's.

783
01:04:05,479 --> 01:04:08,564
You take Jean-Louis with you,
and bolt the door from inside.

784
01:04:08,649 --> 01:04:11,317
Come on, Jean-Louis.
We'll have a treasure hunt.

785
01:04:13,946 --> 01:04:15,863
Tex?

786
01:04:18,492 --> 01:04:20,409
Man, that's Charlie's stuff.

787
01:04:20,494 --> 01:04:22,411
Looks like it.

788
01:04:22,496 --> 01:04:24,914
- Think we ought to call Herman?
- What for?

789
01:04:24,998 --> 01:04:27,917
If it's not here,
why bother him?

790
01:04:28,001 --> 01:04:30,044
And if it is?

791
01:04:30,128 --> 01:04:32,171
Why bother him?

792
01:04:35,968 --> 01:04:38,094
Oh.

793
01:04:38,178 --> 01:04:41,097
- What?
- Sure there's nothing missing here?

794
01:04:41,181 --> 01:04:45,309
No, everything's here.
The police have kindly provided us with a list.

795
01:04:46,853 --> 01:04:49,772
Sure ain't nothin' here
worth no quarter of a million dollars.

796
01:04:49,856 --> 01:04:51,774
Not unless we're blind.

797
01:04:51,858 --> 01:04:55,111
I keep telling myself
we've stolen a great deal of money...

798
01:04:55,195 --> 01:04:58,114
but up to now I've yet
to see a penny of it.

799
01:04:58,198 --> 01:05:01,200
You think maybe we're fishin'
up the wrong stream?

800
01:05:02,536 --> 01:05:04,453
Meaning what?

801
01:05:04,538 --> 01:05:08,332
Suppose one of us has it.
You know, like the man says.

802
01:05:08,417 --> 01:05:10,626
Now, that'd be mighty distasteful...

803
01:05:10,711 --> 01:05:13,629
us bein' veterans
of the same war and all.

804
01:05:13,714 --> 01:05:18,467
Well, you know I'd tell you if I had it.

805
01:05:18,552 --> 01:05:21,679
Oh, naturally.
Just like I'd tell you if I had it.

806
01:05:21,763 --> 01:05:23,681
Naturally.

807
01:05:23,765 --> 01:05:26,017
And that goes for Herman, too.

808
01:05:26,101 --> 01:05:28,227
Naturally.

809
01:05:31,898 --> 01:05:34,567
He's all right, Sylvie. Honestly.

810
01:05:34,651 --> 01:05:37,737
Just hurry over as soon as you can.
Okay. Good-bye.

811
01:05:39,573 --> 01:05:43,159
Now, if you had a treasure,
where would you hide it?

812
01:05:44,411 --> 01:05:46,329
I would bury it in the garden.

813
01:05:46,413 --> 01:05:49,332
Swell, but this man
doesn't have a garden.

814
01:05:49,416 --> 01:05:51,834
- Oh, neither do I.
- You don't?

815
01:05:51,918 --> 01:05:56,005
Well, if you had to hide it in this room,
where would you put it?

816
01:05:56,089 --> 01:05:58,841
- Up there.
- On top of that cupboard?

817
01:05:58,925 --> 01:06:02,428
You know something?
You may be right.

818
01:06:06,224 --> 01:06:10,144
Oh, I hope I don't find
any hairy little things living up here.

819
01:06:11,271 --> 01:06:13,898
Hey, there is something.
And it's heavy.

820
01:06:13,982 --> 01:06:16,359
I found it!
I found it! I found it!

821
01:06:16,443 --> 01:06:19,695
If you think you're getting credit for this,
you're crazy.

822
01:06:19,780 --> 01:06:21,864
We won!
We won! We won!

823
01:06:21,948 --> 01:06:25,076
We won! We won!
We won! We won!

824
01:06:26,161 --> 01:06:28,537
We found it!
We found it!

825
01:06:28,622 --> 01:06:30,539
- Did you find it?
- No.

826
01:06:30,624 --> 01:06:33,542
- What do you mean, no?
- The kid was yellin'.

827
01:06:33,627 --> 01:06:36,003
Up there.
It's up there.

828
01:06:36,088 --> 01:06:38,798
Believe me,
there's nothing up there.

829
01:06:38,882 --> 01:06:40,800
Yeah?

830
01:06:43,261 --> 01:06:45,179
Oh!

831
01:06:57,609 --> 01:07:00,152
Oh! Jumpin' frijoles.

832
01:07:00,237 --> 01:07:01,987
It's Herman's spare.

833
01:07:04,324 --> 01:07:08,119
- Where is he?
- He's over in my room.

834
01:07:25,762 --> 01:07:28,681
You'd better take the boy
out in the hall.

835
01:07:36,273 --> 01:07:40,735
Oh, now, who would've done
a mean thing like that?

836
01:07:42,320 --> 01:07:44,238
I'm not quite sure.

837
01:07:44,322 --> 01:07:46,449
Well, this ain't my room.

838
01:07:46,533 --> 01:07:48,492
Mine neither.

839
01:07:48,577 --> 01:07:51,787
Oh, the police aren't going to like this a bit.
Tsk, tsk, tsk.

840
01:07:51,872 --> 01:07:55,875
We could dry him off and take him
down the hall to his own room.

841
01:07:55,959 --> 01:07:58,335
He really doesn't look too bad.

842
01:07:58,420 --> 01:08:00,463
Oh, poor old Herman.

843
01:08:00,547 --> 01:08:04,717
Seems like him and good luck
always was strangers.

844
01:08:04,801 --> 01:08:08,721
Well, maybe now he'll meet up with
his other hand someplace.

845
01:08:17,147 --> 01:08:19,565
A man drowned in his bed?

846
01:08:19,649 --> 01:08:21,567
Impossible.

847
01:08:21,651 --> 01:08:24,195
And in his pajamas -
the second one in his pajamas.

848
01:08:24,279 --> 01:08:26,238
C'est trop stupide.

849
01:08:26,323 --> 01:08:28,199
Stop lying to me.

850
01:08:28,283 --> 01:08:31,243
This nose tells me when you are lying.

851
01:08:31,328 --> 01:08:34,538
It is never mistaken,
not in 23 years.

852
01:08:34,623 --> 01:08:37,666
This nose will make me
commissaire of police.

853
01:08:37,751 --> 01:08:41,796
Mr. Dyle, or Mr. Joshua -
Which is it?

854
01:08:41,880 --> 01:08:43,798
Dyle.

855
01:08:43,882 --> 01:08:47,092
And yet you registered
in MegГЁve as Mr. Joshua.

856
01:08:47,177 --> 01:08:51,096
Didn't you know it was against the law
to register under an assumed name?

857
01:08:51,181 --> 01:08:55,142
- No, I didn't.
- It's done in America all the time.

858
01:08:56,228 --> 01:08:58,479
None of you will be
permitted to leave Paris...

859
01:08:58,563 --> 01:09:00,648
until this matter is cleared up.

860
01:09:00,732 --> 01:09:04,235
Only I warn you,
I will be watching.

861
01:09:04,319 --> 01:09:08,364
We use the guillotine in this country.

862
01:09:08,448 --> 01:09:11,909
I have always suspected
that the blade coming down...

863
01:09:11,993 --> 01:09:15,454
causes no more than
a slight tickling sensation...

864
01:09:15,539 --> 01:09:17,957
on the back of the neck.

865
01:09:18,041 --> 01:09:19,959
It is only a guess, of course.

866
01:09:20,043 --> 01:09:23,295
I hope none of you ever
finds out for certain.

867
01:09:30,262 --> 01:09:32,179
Who do you think did it?

868
01:09:32,264 --> 01:09:35,391
- Gideon?
- Possibly.

869
01:09:35,475 --> 01:09:38,060
- Or Tex?
- Possibly.

870
01:09:38,144 --> 01:09:40,062
- You're a fat lot of help.
- That's right.

871
01:09:40,146 --> 01:09:42,064
- Can I have one of those?
- One of what?

872
01:09:42,148 --> 01:09:44,066
- I think Tex did it.
- Oh.

873
01:09:44,150 --> 01:09:47,069
- Vanille et chocolat, s'il vous plait.
- Why do you think Tex did it?

874
01:09:47,153 --> 01:09:49,071
Because I really suspect Gideon...

875
01:09:49,155 --> 01:09:51,615
and it's always the person
you don't suspect.

876
01:09:51,700 --> 01:09:55,160
Do women think it feminine to be so illogical,
or can't they help it?

877
01:09:55,245 --> 01:09:57,162
What's so illogical about that?

878
01:09:57,247 --> 01:10:00,165
You just said it's always
the one you don't suspect.

879
01:10:00,250 --> 01:10:02,585
You suspect Gideon,
therefore it must be Tex.

880
01:10:02,669 --> 01:10:06,797
On the other hand, if you suspect Tex
it must be the other fella, Gideon.

881
01:10:06,882 --> 01:10:09,008
- I guess they just can't help it.
- Hmm?

882
01:10:09,092 --> 01:10:11,010
- Who?
- Women.

883
01:10:11,094 --> 01:10:13,012
Oh.

884
01:10:13,096 --> 01:10:15,848
You know, I can't help
feeling rather sorry for Scobie.

885
01:10:17,017 --> 01:10:19,351
Wouldn't it be nice
if we were like that?

886
01:10:19,436 --> 01:10:21,353
- What, like Scobie?
- No. Gene Kelly.

887
01:10:21,438 --> 01:10:24,356
Remember when he danced down here
by the river in An American in Paris...

888
01:10:24,441 --> 01:10:26,358
without a care in the world?

889
01:10:26,443 --> 01:10:29,278
- Hmm.
- You know, this is good. Want some?

890
01:10:29,362 --> 01:10:32,239
- Uh -
- Oh!

891
01:10:32,324 --> 01:10:34,241
No, thanks.

892
01:10:34,326 --> 01:10:37,953
I guess you don't either. Here, give me that.

893
01:10:38,038 --> 01:10:40,080
I'm sorry.

894
01:10:40,165 --> 01:10:43,042
Alex, I'm scared.

895
01:10:43,126 --> 01:10:45,169
Yes, I know.

896
01:10:45,253 --> 01:10:48,088
I can't think of any reason
why he was killed.

897
01:10:48,173 --> 01:10:51,383
Well, perhaps someone thought
that four shares were too many.

898
01:10:51,468 --> 01:10:55,137
What makes you think that this someone
is going to be satisfied with three?

899
01:10:55,221 --> 01:10:59,975
- He wants it all. That means we're in his way, too.
- That's right.

900
01:11:00,060 --> 01:11:04,271
We've got to do something. I mean,
any minute now we could be assassinated.

901
01:11:04,356 --> 01:11:06,273
Would you do anything like that?

902
01:11:06,358 --> 01:11:09,026
What, assassinate someone?

903
01:11:09,110 --> 01:11:11,820
No. Swing down from there
on a rope to save the woman you love.

904
01:11:11,905 --> 01:11:13,864
Like the hunchback of Notre Dame.

905
01:11:13,949 --> 01:11:15,824
Uh - Huh?

906
01:11:15,909 --> 01:11:18,869
Who put that there?

907
01:11:22,415 --> 01:11:26,126
- Hurry up and change. I'm starved.
- Let me know what you want to eat...

908
01:11:26,211 --> 01:11:28,170
so I can pick out a suit that matches.

909
01:11:28,254 --> 01:11:30,255
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

910
01:11:38,390 --> 01:11:40,391
Uh-uh.

911
01:11:40,475 --> 01:11:41,850
What do you want?

912
01:11:41,935 --> 01:11:45,104
It's the house detective.
Why don't you have a girl in there?

913
01:11:45,188 --> 01:11:47,106
God, you're a pest.

914
01:11:47,190 --> 01:11:50,567
- Can I come in?
- No. I'm going to take a bath.

915
01:11:50,652 --> 01:11:53,529
Wouldn't it be better
if you did it in here?

916
01:11:53,613 --> 01:11:57,032
- What for?
- Well, I wouldn't want to use that tub.

917
01:11:57,117 --> 01:12:00,119
Anyway, I don't want to be alone.
I'm afraid.

918
01:12:00,203 --> 01:12:02,454
You're only next door.
If anything happens, holler.

919
01:12:09,045 --> 01:12:10,921
Reggie?

920
01:12:11,006 --> 01:12:12,840
Got you. Ha, ha.

921
01:12:13,925 --> 01:12:16,760
Did you ever hear the story
of the boy who cried wolf?

922
01:12:16,845 --> 01:12:19,096
The shower's in there.

923
01:12:19,180 --> 01:12:22,725
- Oh, come on, open the door.
- This is a ludicrous situation.

924
01:12:22,809 --> 01:12:26,228
I can think of a dozen men
who are just longing to use my shower.

925
01:12:26,312 --> 01:12:29,690
- Why don't you call one of them?
- I dare you.

926
01:12:29,774 --> 01:12:32,192
Oh, you're a nut.

927
01:12:34,404 --> 01:12:37,740
- What are you doing?
- Taking off my shoes.

928
01:12:37,824 --> 01:12:41,243
Did you ever hear of anyone
taking a shower with their shoes on?

929
01:12:43,830 --> 01:12:47,249
I usually sing a medley of old favorites
when I'm in the shower.

930
01:12:47,333 --> 01:12:50,169
- Any requests?
- Shut the door.

931
01:12:50,253 --> 01:12:54,381
I'm afraid I don't know that one, miss.
Well -

932
01:12:54,466 --> 01:12:56,508
- Shut the door.
- Why?

933
01:12:56,593 --> 01:12:58,510
Come in and watch.

934
01:13:10,273 --> 01:13:12,524
Drip-dry.

935
01:13:13,777 --> 01:13:16,445
How often do you go through
this little ritual?

936
01:13:16,529 --> 01:13:19,239
Oh, every day.
The manufacturer recommends it.

937
01:13:19,324 --> 01:13:21,158
I don't believe it.

938
01:13:21,242 --> 01:13:23,535
Oh, yes, it's -
Wait a minute.

939
01:13:24,662 --> 01:13:27,081
Here's the label.

940
01:13:27,165 --> 01:13:29,083
Look at the small print.

941
01:13:30,293 --> 01:13:32,377
"Wearing this suit during washing...

942
01:13:32,462 --> 01:13:34,838
helps protect its shape."

943
01:13:38,468 --> 01:13:40,469
Whoo!

944
01:13:41,513 --> 01:13:44,431
Waterproof.

945
01:13:48,603 --> 01:13:50,896
Wait.

946
01:13:50,980 --> 01:13:53,690
Acro-nylon.
Fibrous resistant.

947
01:13:53,775 --> 01:13:57,694
Plastic. Rustproof. Fireproof. Proof-proof.

948
01:13:57,779 --> 01:13:59,696
- You're the nut.
- Nut-proof.

949
01:14:05,245 --> 01:14:08,455
- Yes?
- Mrs. Lampert? Bartholomew.

950
01:14:08,540 --> 01:14:10,624
I spoke to Washington, Mrs. Lampert.

951
01:14:10,708 --> 01:14:13,210
Go ahead, Mr. Bartholomew.
I'm listening.

952
01:14:13,294 --> 01:14:17,965
Well, I told them what you said
about this man being Carson Dyle's brother.

953
01:14:18,049 --> 01:14:21,218
I asked them what they knew about it,
and they told me.

954
01:14:21,302 --> 01:14:23,470
You're not gonna like this, Mrs. Lampert.

955
01:14:23,555 --> 01:14:26,140
Carson Dyle had no brother.

956
01:14:28,059 --> 01:14:30,978
- Mrs. Lampert?
- Are you sure there's no mistake?

957
01:14:31,062 --> 01:14:34,398
None whatsoever.
Please be careful, Mrs. Lampert.

958
01:14:34,482 --> 01:14:36,400
Bye.

959
01:14:45,285 --> 01:14:48,328
I left all my drip-dry dripping.
Is that all right?

960
01:14:48,413 --> 01:14:50,455
What's the matter?
Is something wrong?

961
01:14:51,624 --> 01:14:53,542
You're probably weak from hunger.

962
01:14:53,626 --> 01:14:55,544
You've only eaten five times today.

963
01:14:55,628 --> 01:14:59,423
I'll get someone to fix up my suit quickly
and take you out to dinner.

964
01:14:59,507 --> 01:15:02,134
Let's go somewhere crowded.
I feel like a lot of people.

965
01:15:12,103 --> 01:15:14,980
Hey, you know, this thing is still damp.

966
01:15:18,568 --> 01:15:22,154
You haven't spoken a word for 20 minutes.

967
01:15:22,238 --> 01:15:25,449
I was thinking about Charles and Scobie
and who's going to be next.

968
01:15:25,533 --> 01:15:27,451
Me?

969
01:15:27,535 --> 01:15:30,454
I don't suppose you know
who the murderer is, do you?

970
01:15:30,538 --> 01:15:32,456
No. Not yet.

971
01:15:32,540 --> 01:15:36,960
Whoever's left alive at the end will pretty much
have sewn up the nomination, don't you think?

972
01:15:37,045 --> 01:15:40,422
What are you trying to say,
that I might have killed Charles and Scobie?

973
01:15:40,506 --> 01:15:43,383
What do I have to do to satisfy you?
Become the next victim?

974
01:15:43,468 --> 01:15:46,386
- It's a start, anyway.
- Oh.

975
01:15:46,471 --> 01:15:48,388
I can't understand you at all.

976
01:15:48,473 --> 01:15:50,599
One minute you're chasing me
around the shower room.

977
01:15:50,683 --> 01:15:52,684
The next minute you're
accusing me of murder.

978
01:15:53,937 --> 01:15:56,063
Carson Dyle had no brother.

979
01:16:00,235 --> 01:16:03,153
Oh, I can explain that,
if you'll just listen.

980
01:16:03,238 --> 01:16:06,657
Well, I can't very well leave
without a pair of water wings, can I?

981
01:16:06,741 --> 01:16:10,285
- All right, get set for the story of my life.
- Fiction or nonfiction?

982
01:16:10,370 --> 01:16:13,664
- Eh - Why don't you shut up?
- Well!

983
01:16:13,748 --> 01:16:16,458
- Are you going to listen?
- Go on.

984
01:16:16,542 --> 01:16:18,460
All right.

985
01:16:18,544 --> 01:16:22,965
Now, when I was a young man,
my father expected me to go into his business.

986
01:16:23,049 --> 01:16:25,968
Umbrella frames.
That's what he made.

987
01:16:26,052 --> 01:16:30,138
A sensible business, I suppose, but I didn't
have the sense in those days to be sensible.

988
01:16:30,223 --> 01:16:32,724
I suppose all this is leading somewhere.

989
01:16:32,809 --> 01:16:35,978
Well, it led me away from umbrella frames,
for one thing.

990
01:16:36,062 --> 01:16:38,981
But that left me without
any honest means of support.

991
01:16:39,065 --> 01:16:40,983
What do you mean?

992
01:16:41,067 --> 01:16:42,985
Well, in this highly competitive world...

993
01:16:43,069 --> 01:16:46,321
when a man has no profession,
there isn't much choice...

994
01:16:46,406 --> 01:16:49,992
so I began looking for people
who had more money than they needed...

995
01:16:50,076 --> 01:16:52,202
including some they'd barely miss.

996
01:16:52,287 --> 01:16:54,371
You mean you're a thief?

997
01:16:55,498 --> 01:16:57,833
Well, that's not exactly
the term I'd have chosen...

998
01:16:57,917 --> 01:17:01,628
but it sort of captures
the spirit of the thing.

999
01:17:01,713 --> 01:17:04,923
I don't believe it.

1000
01:17:05,008 --> 01:17:07,551
I can't really blame you now.

1001
01:17:07,635 --> 01:17:10,512
But I do believe it.
That's what I don't believe.

1002
01:17:10,596 --> 01:17:13,932
So it's good-bye, Alexander Dyle,
welcome home, Peter Joshua.

1003
01:17:14,976 --> 01:17:17,185
Sorry. The name's Adam Canfield.

1004
01:17:17,270 --> 01:17:20,856
- Adam Canfield?
- Mm-hmm.

1005
01:17:20,940 --> 01:17:24,901
Wonderful. Do you realize you've had
three names in the past two days?

1006
01:17:24,986 --> 01:17:27,654
I don't even know
who I'm talking to anymore.

1007
01:17:27,739 --> 01:17:30,949
- Well, the man's the same, even if the name isn't.
- No, he isn't.

1008
01:17:31,034 --> 01:17:34,286
- Adam Canfield is a crook, and I want to know why.
- Well, it's simple.

1009
01:17:34,370 --> 01:17:36,788
I like what I do. I enjoy my work.

1010
01:17:36,873 --> 01:17:39,541
There aren't many men
who love their work as much as I do.

1011
01:17:39,625 --> 01:17:42,044
You look around sometime.

1012
01:17:42,128 --> 01:17:44,629
Is there a Mrs. Canfield?

1013
01:17:45,840 --> 01:17:48,383
- Yes, but we're divorced.
- "But we're divorced."

1014
01:17:48,468 --> 01:17:51,887
- That's right. Now go and eat your dinner.
- Oh, I could eat a horse.

1015
01:17:51,971 --> 01:17:53,889
I think that's what you ordered.

1016
01:17:53,973 --> 01:17:57,392
Don't you dare be civil with me
after leading me on like this.

1017
01:17:57,477 --> 01:18:00,896
- How did I lead you on?
- Oh, all that marvelous rejection.

1018
01:18:00,980 --> 01:18:02,898
You knew I couldn't resist it.

1019
01:18:02,982 --> 01:18:06,151
- Now it turns out all you're
interested in is the money.
- That's right.

1020
01:18:06,235 --> 01:18:09,154
- Oh.
- Well, what would you like me to say?

1021
01:18:09,238 --> 01:18:12,574
That a pretty girl with an outrageous manner
means more to an old pro like me...

1022
01:18:12,658 --> 01:18:14,576
than a quarter of a million dollars?

1023
01:18:14,660 --> 01:18:18,205
- I don't suppose so.
- It's a toss-up, I can tell you that.

1024
01:18:18,289 --> 01:18:20,457
Hmm.

1025
01:18:20,541 --> 01:18:22,918
- What?
- Hasn't it occurred to you...

1026
01:18:23,002 --> 01:18:26,046
that I'm having a tough time
keeping my hands off you?

1027
01:18:30,134 --> 01:18:34,054
- Oh, you should see your face.
- What's the matter with it?

1028
01:18:34,138 --> 01:18:35,806
It's lovely.

1029
01:18:35,890 --> 01:18:37,808
Ohh.

1030
01:18:38,935 --> 01:18:41,520
Now what's the trouble?

1031
01:18:41,604 --> 01:18:44,815
I'm not hungry anymore.
Isn't it glorious?

1032
01:18:45,900 --> 01:18:48,819
- Adam!
- It's all right. Come and look.

1033
01:18:48,903 --> 01:18:54,991
в™Є For her Romeo came в™Є

1034
01:18:55,076 --> 01:18:58,286
в™Є And в™Є

1035
01:18:58,371 --> 01:19:03,083
в™Є It was closing night в™Є

1036
01:19:03,167 --> 01:19:06,711
в™Є The ending of в™Є

1037
01:19:06,796 --> 01:19:09,714
You don't look so bad in this light.

1038
01:19:09,799 --> 01:19:12,217
Why do you think I brought you here?

1039
01:19:12,301 --> 01:19:14,636
Maybe you wanted me
to see the kind of work...

1040
01:19:14,720 --> 01:19:16,638
the competition was turning out.

1041
01:19:16,722 --> 01:19:18,640
Pretty good, huh?

1042
01:19:18,724 --> 01:19:21,643
I taught them everything they do.

1043
01:19:21,727 --> 01:19:25,939
Oh, did they do that kind of thing
way back in your day?

1044
01:19:26,023 --> 01:19:28,942
Sure. How do you think I got here?

1045
01:19:29,026 --> 01:19:32,154
в™Є I hear it still в™Є

1046
01:19:32,238 --> 01:19:34,739
в™Є I always will в™Є

1047
01:19:34,824 --> 01:19:37,159
- Not allowed to kiss back, huh?
- Oh, no.

1048
01:19:37,243 --> 01:19:40,662
Doctor said it was bad
for my thermostat. Mm-hmm.

1049
01:19:54,469 --> 01:19:57,637
Well, when you come on,
you come on, don't you?

1050
01:19:57,722 --> 01:19:59,931
Well, come on.

1051
01:20:16,741 --> 01:20:18,658
Yeah.

1052
01:20:18,743 --> 01:20:21,328
Hmm?

1053
01:20:21,412 --> 01:20:23,330
In the lobby?

1054
01:20:27,251 --> 01:20:31,171
Are you out of your mind or something?
It's 3:30 in the morning.

1055
01:20:32,924 --> 01:20:34,841
You mean it?

1056
01:20:36,928 --> 01:20:40,805
All right. All right, I'll be right down.
Wait a minute.

1057
01:21:18,261 --> 01:21:21,429
H - H-Hey, turn on the lights!

1058
01:21:28,896 --> 01:21:31,523
Hey, how do you stop this thing?

1059
01:21:51,586 --> 01:21:54,462
Three of them, all in their pajamas?
C'est ridicule.

1060
01:21:54,547 --> 01:21:56,965
What is it, some new American fad?

1061
01:21:57,049 --> 01:22:00,719
And now your friend who lives here,
uh, the one from Texas...

1062
01:22:00,803 --> 01:22:02,971
he has disappeared into thin air.

1063
01:22:03,055 --> 01:22:05,849
- Where is he?
- I wish I knew.

1064
01:22:05,933 --> 01:22:08,059
Madame?

1065
01:22:09,770 --> 01:22:13,523
Tell me, Mr. Dyle.
Where were you at 3:30 a.m.?

1066
01:22:13,608 --> 01:22:15,984
In my room, asleep.

1067
01:22:16,068 --> 01:22:18,403
- And you, Mrs. Lampert?
- I was, too.

1068
01:22:18,487 --> 01:22:20,739
In Mr. Dyle's room?

1069
01:22:20,823 --> 01:22:22,741
No, in my room.

1070
01:22:23,826 --> 01:22:26,328
Obviously you're telling the truth...

1071
01:22:26,412 --> 01:22:29,664
for why would you invent
such a ridiculous story?

1072
01:22:31,083 --> 01:22:34,628
And if I were you,
I wouldn't stay in my pajamas.

1073
01:22:34,712 --> 01:22:36,713
Good night.

1074
01:22:38,424 --> 01:22:41,509
Well, that wraps it up.
Tex has the money.

1075
01:22:41,594 --> 01:22:45,555
- Go to bed. I'll let you know when I've found him.
- You're gonna go looking for him now?

1076
01:22:45,640 --> 01:22:49,392
If the police find him first, they're not going to
turn over that quarter of a million to us.

1077
01:22:49,477 --> 01:22:52,270
- Oh, Adam -
- Go to bed and bolt your door.

1078
01:22:59,570 --> 01:23:02,489
- Yeah?
- Now you listen to me, Dyle.

1079
01:23:02,573 --> 01:23:05,867
I know who's got that money, man,
and I want my share.

1080
01:23:05,951 --> 01:23:10,622
Seems to be growin' and growin' every day.
Well, I ain't disappearin' till I get it.

1081
01:23:10,706 --> 01:23:13,041
- Where are you, Tex?
- Come on, man.

1082
01:23:13,125 --> 01:23:16,670
Look, my mama didn't raise
no stupid children.

1083
01:23:16,754 --> 01:23:18,672
I'll tell you what.

1084
01:23:18,756 --> 01:23:20,674
You wanna find me...

1085
01:23:20,758 --> 01:23:22,676
you just look over your shoulder...

1086
01:23:22,760 --> 01:23:25,679
'cause from now on
I'm gonna be right behind you.

1087
01:23:36,023 --> 01:23:37,982
Open up.

1088
01:23:42,738 --> 01:23:46,658
- I think I was wrong about Tex having the money.
- Why?

1089
01:23:46,742 --> 01:23:49,160
I just heard from him.
He's still hungry.

1090
01:23:49,245 --> 01:23:52,330
That means killing Gideon
didn't get it for him.

1091
01:23:52,415 --> 01:23:55,917
So he's narrowed it down to us.
You've got it.

1092
01:23:56,001 --> 01:23:58,461
But I've looked everywhere.
You know I have.

1093
01:23:58,546 --> 01:24:00,422
Where's the airlines bag?

1094
01:24:00,506 --> 01:24:03,049
- In the wardrobe.
- Get it.

1095
01:24:03,134 --> 01:24:05,051
Lord, you're obstinate.

1096
01:24:05,136 --> 01:24:08,221
Charles must have had it with him
on the train when Tex killed him.

1097
01:24:08,305 --> 01:24:10,223
Thanks.

1098
01:24:11,642 --> 01:24:14,728
Everybody and his Aunt Lillian's
been through that bag...

1099
01:24:14,812 --> 01:24:16,730
including me.

1100
01:24:16,814 --> 01:24:19,733
- Okay, we'll do it again.
- I've been into it at least once a day.

1101
01:24:19,817 --> 01:24:21,735
Somebody would have seen it.

1102
01:24:23,738 --> 01:24:27,115
It's there, Reggie.
We're looking at it right now.

1103
01:24:27,199 --> 01:24:29,784
Something on that bed is worth
a quarter of a million dollars.

1104
01:24:29,869 --> 01:24:33,371
- But what?
- I don't know. I don't know.

1105
01:24:33,456 --> 01:24:35,832
Four passports. No.

1106
01:24:37,877 --> 01:24:39,878
Steamship ticket.

1107
01:24:41,797 --> 01:24:43,673
- Anything in there?
- Nothing.

1108
01:24:43,758 --> 01:24:45,592
Wallet.

1109
01:24:47,178 --> 01:24:49,095
Comb? No.

1110
01:24:50,181 --> 01:24:52,098
A fountain pen.

1111
01:24:55,227 --> 01:24:57,145
What about that key?

1112
01:24:57,229 --> 01:24:59,147
To the apartment.
Matches mine exactly.

1113
01:24:59,231 --> 01:25:01,191
Oh.

1114
01:25:02,610 --> 01:25:05,111
I bet you don't
really need those.

1115
01:25:06,405 --> 01:25:08,406
You need them.

1116
01:25:11,243 --> 01:25:16,247
This still doesn't make sense, but it isn't worth
a quarter of a million dollars either.

1117
01:25:18,334 --> 01:25:20,502
- Wait a minute.
- What?

1118
01:25:20,586 --> 01:25:22,796
- The tooth powder.
- What about it?

1119
01:25:22,880 --> 01:25:25,632
Could you recognize heroin
just by the taste of it?

1120
01:25:31,472 --> 01:25:33,431
Heroin.

1121
01:25:33,516 --> 01:25:35,642
- Peppermint-flavored heroin.
- Hmm.

1122
01:25:37,228 --> 01:25:39,187
Well, I guess that's it.

1123
01:25:39,271 --> 01:25:41,189
Dead end.

1124
01:25:41,273 --> 01:25:44,692
Well, go to bed.
You've gotta go to work in the morning.

1125
01:25:44,777 --> 01:25:47,153
There's nothing more we can do tonight.

1126
01:25:47,238 --> 01:25:49,489
I love you, Adam.

1127
01:25:50,950 --> 01:25:52,909
Yes, you told me.

1128
01:25:52,993 --> 01:25:56,579
No. The last time I said,
"I love you, Alex."

1129
01:25:56,664 --> 01:26:00,792
Oh.

1130
01:26:12,346 --> 01:26:15,098
- Hold it. They're recognizing Great Britain.
- Oh, la vache.

1131
01:26:15,182 --> 01:26:17,308
Mr. Chairman, fellow delegates...

1132
01:26:17,393 --> 01:26:19,978
and my distinguished colleague from Italy.

1133
01:26:20,062 --> 01:26:24,274
Her Majesty's delegation has listened with
great patience to the Southern European -

1134
01:26:24,358 --> 01:26:26,734
- Oh, are you on?
- No, it's all right. What's wrong, Adam?

1135
01:26:26,819 --> 01:26:28,736
Nothing. I think I've found something.

1136
01:26:28,821 --> 01:26:31,739
I was snooping around Tex's room
and came across this in the wastebasket.

1137
01:26:31,824 --> 01:26:33,741
I stuck it together again.

1138
01:26:33,826 --> 01:26:36,244
That's the receipt Grandpierre gave me
for Charles's things.

1139
01:26:36,328 --> 01:26:38,746
- I don't see how that's going to -
- You're not looking.

1140
01:26:38,831 --> 01:26:42,417
When we went through the airlines bag,
something was missing - "un agenda. "

1141
01:26:42,501 --> 01:26:46,254
That's an appointment book, isn't it?
It wasn't there.

1142
01:26:46,338 --> 01:26:48,256
That's right.

1143
01:26:48,340 --> 01:26:50,258
I remember Grandpierre
looking through it...

1144
01:26:50,342 --> 01:26:53,136
but there was nothing in it
the police thought was very important.

1145
01:26:53,220 --> 01:26:55,263
Can you remember anything in it at all?

1146
01:26:55,347 --> 01:26:58,766
Well, it did say something
about Charles's last appointment.

1147
01:26:58,851 --> 01:27:00,768
With whom? Where?

1148
01:27:00,853 --> 01:27:03,771
- I think it only said where.
- Come on, Reggie, think.

1149
01:27:03,856 --> 01:27:05,773
This may be what we're looking for.

1150
01:27:05,858 --> 01:27:08,776
Adam, that money doesn't belong to us.

1151
01:27:08,861 --> 01:27:11,779
- If we keep it, we'll be breaking the law.
- Nonsense. We didn't steal it.

1152
01:27:11,864 --> 01:27:14,616
- There's no law against stealing stolen money.
- Of course there is.

1153
01:27:14,700 --> 01:27:15,909
- There is?
- Yes.

1154
01:27:15,993 --> 01:27:18,202
When did they pass such a silly law?
Think, Reggie.

1155
01:27:18,287 --> 01:27:22,123
- What was in that appointment book?
- Oh, it was a place or street corner or something.

1156
01:27:22,207 --> 01:27:24,125
Watch it. I'm on.

1157
01:27:37,514 --> 01:27:41,100
Of - Of the Western
Hemisphere conference -

1158
01:27:42,811 --> 01:27:44,812
Of the Western Hemisphere conference...

1159
01:27:44,897 --> 01:27:46,814
held on March 22 -

1160
01:27:46,899 --> 01:27:49,692
No, wait!
It was last Thursday, 5:00...

1161
01:27:49,777 --> 01:27:52,111
the Jardins des Champs-Г‰lysГ©es.

1162
01:27:52,196 --> 01:27:54,113
That's it, Adam! The gardens!

1163
01:27:54,198 --> 01:27:57,450
Well, it's Thursday today,
and it's almost 5:00, so come on.

1164
01:27:58,535 --> 01:28:00,453
It's all right, gentlemen. Carry on.

1165
01:28:03,540 --> 01:28:05,583
Now what?

1166
01:28:05,668 --> 01:28:08,503
5:00, Thursday, the gardens.

1167
01:28:08,587 --> 01:28:10,505
Must be something around here.

1168
01:28:10,589 --> 01:28:12,507
Charles's appointment was last week.

1169
01:28:12,591 --> 01:28:15,802
- Yes, I know, but this is all we've got left.
- You're not kidding.

1170
01:28:15,886 --> 01:28:18,304
Ten minutes ago I had a job.

1171
01:28:18,389 --> 01:28:21,307
Now you've got another job,
so stop grumbling and start looking.

1172
01:28:21,392 --> 01:28:24,310
I'll take that side.
You poke around over here.

1173
01:29:03,142 --> 01:29:06,394
It's hopeless.
I don't even know what we're looking for.

1174
01:29:06,478 --> 01:29:08,771
I don't think Tex does either.

1175
01:29:08,856 --> 01:29:11,482
- Tex? Is he here?
- Look.

1176
01:29:16,280 --> 01:29:19,741
I'm going to see what he's up to.
You stay here.

1177
01:29:19,825 --> 01:29:22,785
Be careful, Adam.
He's already killed three men.

1178
01:30:29,520 --> 01:30:31,437
Wait! Wait!

1179
01:30:31,522 --> 01:30:33,439
Taxi!

1180
01:30:33,524 --> 01:30:35,441
Look out.

1181
01:30:53,085 --> 01:30:55,378
All right, where's the letter?

1182
01:30:56,421 --> 01:31:00,007
The letter, huh?
It ain't worth nothin'.

1183
01:31:00,092 --> 01:31:03,010
You know what I mean.
The envelope with the stamps on it.

1184
01:31:03,095 --> 01:31:05,012
I want it.

1185
01:31:05,097 --> 01:31:07,974
You greenhorn.

1186
01:31:08,058 --> 01:31:12,645
Why, you thick-skulled, harebrained,
half-witted greenhorn.

1187
01:31:12,729 --> 01:31:15,565
And they was both too smart for us.

1188
01:31:15,649 --> 01:31:19,402
- What are you talking about?
- First her husband, now her.

1189
01:31:19,486 --> 01:31:21,696
She batted all of them big eyes at you...

1190
01:31:21,780 --> 01:31:26,367
and you fell for it like an egg
from a tall chicken.

1191
01:31:26,451 --> 01:31:28,703
You want the envelope?

1192
01:31:28,787 --> 01:31:32,081
There. You take it. It's all yours.

1193
01:31:35,127 --> 01:31:38,421
You killed all three of 'em for nothin'!

1194
01:31:40,674 --> 01:31:42,550
You greenhorn!

1195
01:31:42,634 --> 01:31:45,636
You block-headed jackass!

1196
01:31:45,721 --> 01:31:48,139
You nincompoop!

1197
01:31:51,310 --> 01:31:53,227
Sylvie!
What are you doing here?

1198
01:31:53,312 --> 01:31:55,563
I'm waiting for Jean-Louis.

1199
01:31:55,647 --> 01:31:57,565
Oh. What's he up to?

1200
01:31:57,649 --> 01:32:00,860
He was so excited when he got the stamps
you gave him this morning.

1201
01:32:00,944 --> 01:32:03,821
- He said he'd never seen any like them.
- I'm glad.

1202
01:32:03,906 --> 01:32:05,823
- What's all this?
- The stamp market.

1203
01:32:05,908 --> 01:32:07,867
It's there every Thursday afternoon.

1204
01:32:07,951 --> 01:32:10,286
That's where Jean-Louis trades his stamps.

1205
01:32:11,663 --> 01:32:14,248
- Good Lord, where is he?
- What's the matter, chГ©rie?

1206
01:32:14,333 --> 01:32:16,584
The stamps!
They're worth a fortune!

1207
01:32:16,668 --> 01:32:19,378
- What?
- A fortune! Come on!

1208
01:32:26,762 --> 01:32:29,680
- Oh, I don't see him anywhere.
- We'll separate.

1209
01:32:29,765 --> 01:32:31,849
- You look over there.
- Okay.

1210
01:32:35,771 --> 01:32:41,734
Jean-Louis.

1211
01:32:41,818 --> 01:32:44,278
Jean-Louis!

1212
01:32:51,703 --> 01:32:55,581
Jean-Louis.

1213
01:32:55,666 --> 01:32:58,584
Reggie. Reggie.

1214
01:33:01,546 --> 01:33:04,465
Jean-Louis, thank heaven.
Do you have the -

1215
01:33:05,842 --> 01:33:09,720
- What's this?
- A man gave me all those for only three.

1216
01:33:09,805 --> 01:33:13,516
A man? Oh, no, Jean-Louis.
Who? Where?

1217
01:33:15,936 --> 01:33:18,396
Vite, mon chГ©ri. Vite.

1218
01:33:19,606 --> 01:33:21,232
- LГ -bas.
- Come on.

1219
01:33:25,279 --> 01:33:28,197
- Oh, but he's gone.
- I don't blame him.

1220
01:33:28,282 --> 01:33:30,700
Entrez.

1221
01:33:32,244 --> 01:33:34,537
- Monsieur Felix?
- Oui.

1222
01:33:36,581 --> 01:33:39,750
I was expecting you.
I knew you would come.

1223
01:33:39,835 --> 01:33:41,752
Look at them, madame.

1224
01:33:41,837 --> 01:33:45,548
Have you ever, in your entire life,
seen anything so beautifuI?

1225
01:33:45,632 --> 01:33:48,551
I'm sorry.
I don't know anything about stamps.

1226
01:33:48,635 --> 01:33:52,930
I know them as one knows his own face,
though I had never seen them.

1227
01:33:53,015 --> 01:33:55,349
This one, a Swedish four shilling...

1228
01:33:55,434 --> 01:33:57,476
called Den Gula Fyraskillingen...

1229
01:33:57,561 --> 01:33:59,520
printed in 1854.

1230
01:33:59,604 --> 01:34:02,857
- What is it worth?
- Oh, the money is unimportant.

1231
01:34:02,941 --> 01:34:05,109
I'm afraid it's very important.

1232
01:34:05,193 --> 01:34:08,446
Well, in your money, perhaps $85,000.

1233
01:34:09,573 --> 01:34:11,490
- May I sit down?
- Yes.

1234
01:34:11,575 --> 01:34:14,702
- And the blue one?
- Oh, it's called The Hawaiian Blue.

1235
01:34:14,786 --> 01:34:17,913
In 1894, the owner was murdered
by a rival collector...

1236
01:34:17,998 --> 01:34:19,915
who was obsessed to own it.

1237
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:21,959
And what is its value today?

1238
01:34:22,044 --> 01:34:24,628
65,000.

1239
01:34:24,713 --> 01:34:28,257
- And the last one.
- Ah, the best for last.

1240
01:34:28,342 --> 01:34:31,802
Le chef-d'Е“uvre de la collection.
The masterpiece.

1241
01:34:31,887 --> 01:34:34,638
The most valuable stamp
in the world.

1242
01:34:34,723 --> 01:34:36,682
It's called
the Gazette Maldave.

1243
01:34:36,767 --> 01:34:41,645
It was printed by hand on colored paper
and marked with the initials of the printer.

1244
01:34:41,730 --> 01:34:46,359
Today it has a value
of $100,000.

1245
01:34:46,443 --> 01:34:48,944
I'm not a thief, madame.

1246
01:34:49,029 --> 01:34:50,988
I knew there was some mistake.

1247
01:34:55,035 --> 01:34:57,953
You gave the boy a great
many stamps in return.

1248
01:34:58,038 --> 01:34:59,955
- Are they for sale now?
- Let me see.

1249
01:35:00,040 --> 01:35:02,541
350 European, 200 Asian...

1250
01:35:02,626 --> 01:35:05,544
175 American, 100 African...

1251
01:35:05,629 --> 01:35:08,547
and 12 Princess Grace commemorative...

1252
01:35:08,632 --> 01:35:10,549
which comes to 10 francs.

1253
01:35:12,928 --> 01:35:15,179
And don't forget these.

1254
01:35:15,263 --> 01:35:17,431
Thank you.

1255
01:35:17,516 --> 01:35:19,392
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, no.

1256
01:35:19,476 --> 01:35:23,687
For a few minutes they were mine.
That is enough.

1257
01:35:28,193 --> 01:35:31,153
Adam? Adam?

1258
01:36:13,572 --> 01:36:15,990
- Hello?
- Mr. Bartholomew?

1259
01:36:16,074 --> 01:36:17,992
Yes.

1260
01:36:18,076 --> 01:36:20,161
Tex is dead. Smothered.

1261
01:36:23,415 --> 01:36:26,876
And Adam did it. He killed them all.

1262
01:36:26,960 --> 01:36:30,629
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

1263
01:36:30,714 --> 01:36:34,008
Tex wrote the word "Dyle"
before he died.

1264
01:36:36,595 --> 01:36:38,512
He's the murderer, I tell you.

1265
01:36:38,597 --> 01:36:42,266
Wait a minute, Mrs. Lampert.
You'd better give that to me again.

1266
01:36:42,350 --> 01:36:45,561
It was the stamps on the letter
Charles had with him on the train.

1267
01:36:45,645 --> 01:36:49,356
They were in plain view all the time,
but no one bothered to look at the envelope.

1268
01:36:49,441 --> 01:36:52,693
Mrs. Lampert, listen to me.
You're not safe as long as you have these stamps.

1269
01:36:52,777 --> 01:36:56,489
Let's see. Do you know the center garden
at the Palais Royale?

1270
01:36:56,573 --> 01:36:59,074
- Yes. The colonnade?
- Yes, by the colonnade.

1271
01:36:59,159 --> 01:37:04,121
- As fast as you can get there. Hurry, Mrs. Lampert.
- I'm leaving right away. Good-bye.

1272
01:37:17,969 --> 01:37:20,971
Reggie! The stamps!
Where are they? Reggie! Wait!

1273
01:37:21,056 --> 01:37:24,266
So you can kill me, too? Tex is dead.
He wrote "Dyle" on the carpet.

1274
01:37:24,351 --> 01:37:27,811
- I'm not Dyle. You know that.
- But Tex didn't know it. You're a murderer.

1275
01:37:27,896 --> 01:37:29,813
Reggie, I want those stamps!

1276
01:37:29,898 --> 01:37:32,858
- Palais Royale, vite.
- Je suis occupГ©.

1277
01:37:32,943 --> 01:37:35,110
- Mais c'est trГЁs urgent.
- OccupГ©.

1278
01:38:11,189 --> 01:38:13,065
Whoa!
Billet, monsieur.

1279
01:40:15,105 --> 01:40:17,022
Oh!

1280
01:40:39,754 --> 01:40:41,672
American Embassy.

1281
01:40:41,756 --> 01:40:44,216
A-American Embassy?

1282
01:40:44,300 --> 01:40:48,262
Uh, Mr. Bartholomew's office, please.

1283
01:40:48,346 --> 01:40:52,266
- Would you speak a little louder, please?
- I can't speak any louder.

1284
01:40:52,350 --> 01:40:54,810
Mr. Hamilton Bartholomew.

1285
01:40:54,894 --> 01:40:57,312
I'm sorry.
Mr. Bartholomew has left for the day.

1286
01:40:57,397 --> 01:41:01,233
But someone's trying to kill me.

1287
01:41:01,317 --> 01:41:03,736
- What?
- Kill me!

1288
01:41:03,820 --> 01:41:06,238
You've got to get word
to him right away.

1289
01:41:06,322 --> 01:41:09,950
He's - He's in the center garden
of the Palais Royale near the colonnade.

1290
01:41:10,034 --> 01:41:13,287
Tell him I'm trapped in a phone booth
right below him in the metro station.

1291
01:41:13,371 --> 01:41:15,330
The name's Lampert.

1292
01:41:59,375 --> 01:42:01,627
- Hello?
- Hello. Mr. Bartholomew?

1293
01:42:01,711 --> 01:42:04,880
- Yes.
- There was a call for you
just now, Mr. Bartholomew.

1294
01:42:04,964 --> 01:42:07,466
It sounded quite urgent.
A Mrs. Lampert.

1295
01:42:07,550 --> 01:42:10,636
Lampert? I don't know any Mrs. Lampert.

1296
01:42:10,720 --> 01:42:14,473
She says she's trapped in a metro station
and someone's trying to kill her.

1297
01:42:14,557 --> 01:42:19,520
Trying to kill her?
Who does she think I am, the C.I.A.?

1298
01:42:19,604 --> 01:42:22,481
All right, I guess you'd better call
the French police.

1299
01:43:14,284 --> 01:43:17,494
Mr. Bartholomew!
Mr. Bartholomew!

1300
01:43:17,579 --> 01:43:19,496
- Help me!
- Reggie, stop.

1301
01:43:20,415 --> 01:43:22,499
That man is Carson Dyle.

1302
01:43:24,586 --> 01:43:27,379
We all know Carson Dyle
is dead, Mrs. Lampert.

1303
01:43:27,463 --> 01:43:30,591
- I tell you, he's Carson Dyle.
- Now, you're not gonna believe him.

1304
01:43:30,675 --> 01:43:33,510
Bring those stamps over here.
He's trying to trick you again.

1305
01:43:33,595 --> 01:43:37,514
Tex recognized him. That's why he wrote Dyle.

1306
01:43:37,599 --> 01:43:40,893
- If you take him those stamps, he'll kill you, too.
- Mrs. Lampert...

1307
01:43:40,977 --> 01:43:45,022
if I'm who he says I am,
what's preventing me from killing you right now?

1308
01:43:45,106 --> 01:43:48,775
Because he'd have to come out to get the stamps,
and he knows he'd never make it.

1309
01:43:48,860 --> 01:43:51,778
Mrs. Lampert,
he wants the money for himself.

1310
01:43:51,863 --> 01:43:53,864
That's all he's ever wanted.

1311
01:43:53,948 --> 01:43:57,701
- He's with the C.I.A. I saw him at the embassy.
- I tell you, he's Carson Dyle.

1312
01:43:57,785 --> 01:44:00,078
That's right, Mrs. Lampert.
That's right.

1313
01:44:00,163 --> 01:44:02,205
I'm a dead man. Look at me.

1314
01:44:06,252 --> 01:44:08,253
Oh, I don't know who anybody is.

1315
01:44:08,338 --> 01:44:10,631
Reggie, I beg you.

1316
01:44:10,715 --> 01:44:12,633
Just trust me once more.

1317
01:44:12,717 --> 01:44:14,885
Why should I?

1318
01:44:14,969 --> 01:44:18,221
I can't think of a reason
in the world why you should.

1319
01:44:24,479 --> 01:44:26,730
Stop right now, Mrs. Lampert,
or I'll kill you.

1320
01:44:26,814 --> 01:44:29,983
It won't get you the stamps, Dyle.
You'll have to come out to get them...

1321
01:44:30,068 --> 01:44:32,194
and I'm not likely to miss at this range.

1322
01:44:32,278 --> 01:44:34,988
Maybe not, but it takes
a lot of bullets to kill me.

1323
01:44:35,073 --> 01:44:38,200
They left me there with five of them
in my legs and my stomach.

1324
01:44:38,284 --> 01:44:40,994
Mrs. Lampert, they knew I was alive,
but they left me there.

1325
01:44:41,079 --> 01:44:43,956
I spent 10 months in a German prison camp
with nothing to stop the pain.

1326
01:44:44,040 --> 01:44:46,667
They left me there, Mrs. Lampert.
They deserved to die.

1327
01:44:46,751 --> 01:44:50,504
- But I had nothing to do with it.
- You've got the money now. It belongs to me.

1328
01:44:50,588 --> 01:44:54,299
Mrs. Lampert, they knew I was still alive,
but they left me there.

1329
01:44:54,384 --> 01:44:57,636
That's why I had to kill them,
all four of them.

1330
01:44:57,720 --> 01:45:01,098
Please believe me. I'll kill you, too.
It won't make any difference.

1331
01:45:02,850 --> 01:45:06,019
It's no use.
You're running out of time.

1332
01:45:06,104 --> 01:45:09,606
I've come too far to turn back.
I swear, I'll kill you.

1333
01:45:11,985 --> 01:45:14,528
Make up your mind, Mrs. Lampert. Now.

1334
01:45:14,612 --> 01:45:16,279
Adam!

1335
01:47:37,004 --> 01:47:40,090
All right.

1336
01:47:40,174 --> 01:47:43,260
I know you're in there, Mrs. Lampert.
Come on out.

1337
01:48:00,403 --> 01:48:02,863
Do you hear me? Come on out.

1338
01:48:15,168 --> 01:48:18,628
I don't want to kill you, but I will.

1339
01:48:23,467 --> 01:48:25,218
Come on out.

1340
01:49:01,714 --> 01:49:04,132
The game is over, Mrs. Lampert.

1341
01:49:36,540 --> 01:49:40,085
You didn't have to chase me so hard.

1342
01:49:40,169 --> 01:49:43,088
- That one's done. Do this one.
- Oh.

1343
01:49:43,172 --> 01:49:46,091
I'm sorry I thought
you were the murderer...

1344
01:49:46,175 --> 01:49:49,594
but how was I to know
he was as big a liar as you are?

1345
01:49:49,679 --> 01:49:52,597
Is that all the gratitude I get
for saving your hide?

1346
01:49:52,682 --> 01:49:57,269
- Rub your own blinking foot.
- The truth now. Was it my hide, or those stamps?

1347
01:49:57,353 --> 01:50:00,272
What a terrible thing to say.
How could you think that?

1348
01:50:00,356 --> 01:50:02,274
Then prove it to me.

1349
01:50:02,358 --> 01:50:06,278
Tell me to go to the embassy first thing
in the morning and turn in those stamps.

1350
01:50:08,155 --> 01:50:11,992
- I said, tell me to go to the embassy first -
- I heard you, I heard you.

1351
01:50:12,076 --> 01:50:13,994
Then say it.

1352
01:50:14,078 --> 01:50:17,205
Now, Reggie, listen to me.

1353
01:50:17,290 --> 01:50:20,500
- There's something I'd like to explain.
- Never mind. I'll go by myself.

1354
01:50:20,584 --> 01:50:23,670
What makes you think they're even interested?
It's only a quarter million.

1355
01:50:23,754 --> 01:50:27,090
It'll cost more than that for them
to fix their bookkeeping. As a taxpayer -

1356
01:50:27,174 --> 01:50:29,467
Who's a taxpayer?
Crooks don't pay taxes.

1357
01:50:30,219 --> 01:50:32,137
- Excuse me, soldier -
- Marine, ma'am.

1358
01:50:32,221 --> 01:50:36,474
Forgive me. Who would I see regarding
the return of stolen government money?

1359
01:50:36,559 --> 01:50:38,476
You might try the Treasury Department.

1360
01:50:38,561 --> 01:50:40,687
Room 217, second floor, Mr. Cruikshank.

1361
01:50:40,771 --> 01:50:43,106
217. Thank you, marine.

1362
01:50:49,196 --> 01:50:52,115
Uh - Uh, do you mind
if I don't go in with you?

1363
01:50:52,199 --> 01:50:56,119
The sight of all that money being given away
might make me break out.

1364
01:50:58,456 --> 01:51:01,374
Mr. Cruikshank, please.
My name is Lampert.

1365
01:51:01,459 --> 01:51:03,376
Yes.

1366
01:51:03,461 --> 01:51:06,379
- Mr. Cruikshank, a Miss Lamp -
- Mrs.

1367
01:51:06,464 --> 01:51:08,590
Mrs. Lampert to see you.

1368
01:51:08,674 --> 01:51:10,967
- Yes, sir. Go right in.
- Thank you.

1369
01:51:21,437 --> 01:51:24,856
Of all the mean...

1370
01:51:24,940 --> 01:51:26,858
rotten...

1371
01:51:26,942 --> 01:51:29,694
contemptible, crooked -

1372
01:51:29,779 --> 01:51:33,114
Crooked? I should think you'd be glad
to find out I'm not crooked.

1373
01:51:33,199 --> 01:51:35,575
You can't even be honest
about being dishonest.

1374
01:51:35,659 --> 01:51:37,577
Why didn't you say something?

1375
01:51:37,661 --> 01:51:41,331
- We're not allowed to tell.
Come on, give me the stamps.
- Hmm.

1376
01:51:42,833 --> 01:51:46,419
Wait a minute. How did Carson Dyle
get an office in this building anyway?

1377
01:51:46,504 --> 01:51:49,756
- When did you meet him?
What time of day, I mean.
- About 1:00.

1378
01:51:49,840 --> 01:51:53,259
The lunch hour.
Probably worked it out in advance.

1379
01:51:53,344 --> 01:51:56,679
Found an office usually left open
and moved in for the time you were here.

1380
01:51:56,764 --> 01:52:00,392
Then how do I know this is your office?

1381
01:52:00,476 --> 01:52:05,146
Mrs. Foster, take a memo to Bartholomew
in Security recommending -

1382
01:52:05,231 --> 01:52:07,482
Bartholomew.

1383
01:52:07,566 --> 01:52:10,443
Recommending that embassy offices
be kept locked during the lunch hour.

1384
01:52:10,528 --> 01:52:12,946
Mmm. Starting with his own.

1385
01:52:13,030 --> 01:52:15,907
- Give me the stamps. Come on.
- What's your first name today?

1386
01:52:15,991 --> 01:52:18,326
- Brian.
- Brian Cruikshank.

1387
01:52:18,411 --> 01:52:20,912
Serves me right
if I get stuck with that one.

1388
01:52:20,996 --> 01:52:23,873
- Who asked you to get stuck with any of them?
- Is there a Mrs. Cruikshank?

1389
01:52:23,958 --> 01:52:25,875
- Yes.
- But we're divorced.

1390
01:52:25,960 --> 01:52:27,836
No.

1391
01:52:28,879 --> 01:52:30,839
Oh.

1392
01:52:32,633 --> 01:52:34,384
My mother. She lives in Detroit.

1393
01:52:34,468 --> 01:52:37,762
You'd like her. She'd like you, too.
Come on, give me those stamps.

1394
01:52:37,847 --> 01:52:41,057
Not until you prove to me
that you're really Brian Cruikshank.

1395
01:52:41,142 --> 01:52:44,477
One day next week I'll put it
on a marriage license. How about that?

1396
01:52:44,562 --> 01:52:46,479
Quit stalling.
I want some identification now.

1397
01:52:46,564 --> 01:52:50,442
- I wouldn't lie on a license.
- You can't prove it. You're still trying to -

1398
01:52:50,526 --> 01:52:52,944
"Marriage license"?

1399
01:52:53,028 --> 01:52:55,405
Did you say "marriage license"?

1400
01:52:55,489 --> 01:52:58,450
Don't change the subject.
Just give me the stamps.

1401
01:52:58,534 --> 01:53:03,121
Oh, I love you, Adam, Alex, Peter, Brian,
whatever your name is.

1402
01:53:03,205 --> 01:53:05,123
Oh, I love you.

1403
01:53:05,207 --> 01:53:07,125
I hope we have a lot of boys.

1404
01:53:07,209 --> 01:53:09,127
We can name them all after you.

1405
01:53:09,211 --> 01:53:12,130
Well, before we start that,
may I have the stamps?

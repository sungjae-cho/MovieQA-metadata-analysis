01:36:53,891 --> 01:36:55,726
No, old sport.

1759
01:36:55,976 --> 01:36:59,271
No, you see, she never loved you.

1760
01:36:59,648 --> 01:37:01,358
She only married you
because I was poor...

1761
01:37:01,524 --> 01:37:03,568
...and she was tired of waiting.
It was a terrible...

1762
01:37:04,277 --> 01:37:07,072
...terrible mistake, but in her heart...

1763
01:37:07,238 --> 01:37:08,657
In her heart, she never loved...

1764
01:37:08,823 --> 01:37:10,115
...anyone but me.

1765
01:37:10,283 --> 01:37:11,784
- We should go.
- Let's all go home.

1766
01:37:11,952 --> 01:37:13,828
- Sit down, Daisy!
GATSBY: Please.

1767
01:37:14,662 --> 01:37:15,454
Please, take a seat.

1768
01:37:16,706 --> 01:37:18,123
Go on, Daisy.

1769
01:37:19,835 --> 01:37:21,127
TOM:
Daisy...

1770
01:37:22,503 --> 01:37:23,587
...what's been going on?

1771
01:37:23,755 --> 01:37:25,881
- I want to hear about it.
- I told you what's going on.

1772
01:37:26,048 --> 01:37:27,759
It's been going on for five years.

1773
01:37:28,051 --> 01:37:29,802
You've been seeing him...

1774
01:37:31,054 --> 01:37:32,346
...for five years?

1775
01:37:32,514 --> 01:37:35,809
No, no, no, not seeing.
Not seeing, we couldn't. But...

1776
01:37:35,975 --> 01:37:38,979
...both of us loved each other
all that time. Didn't we?

1777
01:37:39,354 --> 01:37:40,354
TOM:
Oh, that's all.

1778
01:37:41,398 --> 01:37:43,108
Ha-ha-ha! You're crazy!

1779
01:37:43,733 --> 01:37:44,568
I can't speak about...

1780
01:37:44,734 --> 01:37:48,113
...what happened five years ago
because I didn't know Daisy then.

1781
01:37:48,279 --> 01:37:51,240
And I'll be damned if I see how
you got within a mile of her...

1782
01:37:51,408 --> 01:37:54,159
...unless you brought the groceries
to the back door.

1783
01:37:54,368 --> 01:37:55,578
But all the rest of that...

1784
01:37:55,744 --> 01:37:57,122
...is a goddamn lie.

1785
01:37:57,288 --> 01:37:57,997
Daisy loved me...

1786
01:37:58,163 --> 01:37:59,791
...when she married me...

1787
01:38:00,207 --> 01:38:01,626
...and she loves me now.
GATSBY: No.

1788
01:38:01,792 --> 01:38:04,212
- No. I'm sorry, Mr. Buchanan, no.
TOM: She does! She does, though.

1789
01:38:04,378 --> 01:38:05,255
No, she does, though.

1790
01:38:05,421 --> 01:38:08,007
She does. And what's more, I love Daisy too.

1791
01:38:09,301 --> 01:38:10,260
No.

1792
01:38:11,386 --> 01:38:12,386
I love you, Daisy.

1793
01:38:13,470 --> 01:38:14,555
Now, once in a while...

1794
01:38:14,722 --> 01:38:17,182
...I go off on a spree. I always come back.

1795
01:38:17,350 --> 01:38:19,853
- A spree.
TOM: And in my heart I love her all the time.

1796
01:38:20,020 --> 01:38:21,354
You're revolting.

1797
01:38:21,520 --> 01:38:22,396
You know why we left...

1798
01:38:22,564 --> 01:38:24,565
...Chicago? I'm surprised
they didn't treat you...

1799
01:38:24,733 --> 01:38:26,275
...to the story of that little spree!

1800
01:38:26,443 --> 01:38:29,445
That's all over now, Daisy, darling.
That's all over.

1801
01:38:29,613 --> 01:38:31,155
Just tell him the truth. Go on.

1802
01:38:31,323 --> 01:38:35,201
That you never loved him
and this will all be wiped out forever.

1803
01:38:35,368 --> 01:38:36,493
How could I love him...

1804
01:38:36,661 --> 01:38:38,829
...possibly?
GATSBY: Remember our plans.

1805
01:38:38,997 --> 01:38:40,873
You tell him that you never loved him
and all...

1806
01:38:41,041 --> 01:38:42,667
...this pain will be wiped out...

1807
01:38:42,833 --> 01:38:43,792
...forever.

1808
01:38:44,668 --> 01:38:45,795
Daisy.

1809
01:38:47,421 --> 01:38:49,466
Daisy, tell him.

1810
01:38:49,673 --> 01:38:51,009
I never loved him.

1811
01:38:52,719 --> 01:38:53,845
Never?

1812
01:38:54,179 --> 01:38:56,055
- No.
- No.

1813
01:38:57,349 --> 01:38:59,059
Not at Kapiolani?

1814
01:39:02,895 --> 01:39:06,106
Not that day I carried you down from
the Punch Bowl to keep your shoes dry?

1815
01:39:11,070 --> 01:39:11,904
Never?

1816
01:39:12,863 --> 01:39:14,615
Please don't.

1817
01:39:15,240 --> 01:39:16,408
Daisy.

1818
01:39:17,702 --> 01:39:19,412
There, Jay.

1819
01:39:20,037 --> 01:39:21,247
You want too much.

1820
01:39:21,706 --> 01:39:22,707
I love you now...

1821
01:39:22,873 --> 01:39:24,333
...isn't that enough? I can't help...

1822
01:39:24,501 --> 01:39:25,668
...what's past.

1823
01:39:25,835 --> 01:39:28,253
I did love him once,
but I loved you too.

1824
01:39:31,048 --> 01:39:33,426
You loved me too?

1825
01:39:33,592 --> 01:39:34,802
You loved me...?

1826
01:39:34,970 --> 01:39:35,970
Even that is a lie!

1827
01:39:36,136 --> 01:39:37,096
She didn't know you were alive!

1828
01:39:37,262 --> 01:39:38,931
There are things between Daisy and me...

1829
01:39:39,099 --> 01:39:40,432
...Gatsby, that you'll never know.

1830
01:39:40,600 --> 01:39:42,351
- Things that neither of us can ever forget.
GATSBY: I need to...

1831
01:39:42,519 --> 01:39:43,686
...speak to Daisy alone.

1832
01:39:43,853 --> 01:39:47,189
You see, you've got her
all excited now, don't you...

1833
01:39:47,356 --> 01:39:49,192
...old sport? Daisy.
DAISY: Even alone...

1834
01:39:49,359 --> 01:39:52,153
...I can't say I never loved Torn.
It wouldn't be true.

1835
01:39:52,319 --> 01:39:53,488
- What?
- Of course it wouldn't.

1836
01:39:53,654 --> 01:39:55,698
- As if it mattered to you.
TOM: Of course it matters!

1837
01:39:55,864 --> 01:39:57,658
I'm gonna take better care of you
from now on.

1838
01:39:57,826 --> 01:40:01,078
You're not taking care of Daisy
anymore. She's leaving you.

1839
01:40:01,246 --> 01:40:02,413
Nonsense!

1840
01:40:02,579 --> 01:40:04,457
- I am, though!
TOM: No, no, no.

1841
01:40:04,623 --> 01:40:05,667
She is not leaving me.

1842
01:40:05,833 --> 01:40:06,751
Certainly not...

1843
01:40:06,917 --> 01:40:08,336
...for a common swindler...

1844
01:40:08,502 --> 01:40:09,503
...like you.

1845
01:40:09,671 --> 01:40:12,131
Mr. Gatsby, exactly who are you, anyhow?

1846
01:40:12,297 --> 01:40:13,341
I made an investigation...

1847
01:40:13,507 --> 01:40:14,884
...into your affairs. You're one...

1848
01:40:15,051 --> 01:40:16,219
...of Meyer Wolfshiem's bunch.

1849
01:40:16,386 --> 01:40:17,761
Please, let's go home.

1850
01:40:17,929 --> 01:40:19,346
See, he and this Wolfshiem...

1851
01:40:19,514 --> 01:40:20,931
...they bought up drugstores.

1852
01:40:21,099 --> 01:40:22,350
And sold bootlegged...

1853
01:40:22,516 --> 01:40:23,643
...alcohol over the counter.

1854
01:40:23,810 --> 01:40:25,145
What about it, old sport?

1855
01:40:25,310 --> 01:40:26,520
Don't you call me "old sport."

1856
01:40:26,688 --> 01:40:28,105
And this drugstore business...

1857
01:40:28,273 --> 01:40:30,774
...is just small change
compared to this bonds stunt...

1858
01:40:30,942 --> 01:40:32,402
...that you and Wolfshiem
have got going.

1859
01:40:32,569 --> 01:40:33,610
Your friend Walter Chase...

1860
01:40:33,778 --> 01:40:35,404
-...isn't too proud to come in?
-I gave u..

1861
01:40:35,572 --> 01:40:36,405
...that some thought.

1862
01:40:36,573 --> 01:40:37,907
How does a reputable banker...

1863
01:40:38,073 --> 01:40:39,743
...like Walter Chase find himself...

1864
01:40:39,908 --> 01:40:41,368
...up to his eyeballs in debt...

1865
01:40:41,536 --> 01:40:43,371
GATSBY: I'll tell you.
-...to a little kike like Wolfshiem?

1866
01:40:43,537 --> 01:40:45,789
-It's called greed, old sport.
TOM: That's right!

1867
01:40:46,123 --> 01:40:48,917
And you have half of Wall Street
out there swilling your...

1868
01:40:49,085 --> 01:40:51,837
...free booze at that fun park
every weekend.

1869
01:40:52,005 --> 01:40:53,506
I'm surprised he hasn't
tried to drag you in.

1870
01:40:56,301 --> 01:40:57,426
My God, he has.

1871
01:40:57,594 --> 01:40:58,845
He's got nothing to do with--

1872
01:40:59,011 --> 01:41:00,305
With your little racket.

1873
01:41:02,640 --> 01:41:03,850
Daisy.

1874
01:41:04,059 --> 01:41:05,310
Daisy.

1875
01:41:06,269 --> 01:41:08,563
Can't you see who this guy is...

1876
01:41:08,729 --> 01:41:13,609
...with his house and his parties
and his fancy clothes?

1877
01:41:14,277 --> 01:41:16,237
He is just a front...

1878
01:41:16,404 --> 01:41:18,530
...for Wolfshiem, a gangster...

1879
01:41:18,698 --> 01:41:21,033
...to get his claws into respectable folk
like Walter Chase.

1880
01:41:21,201 --> 01:41:24,496
The only respectable thing about you,
old sport, is your money.

1881
01:41:24,662 --> 01:41:26,497
Your money, that's it.
Now I've just as much...

1882
01:41:26,663 --> 01:41:28,041
...as you. That means we're equal.

1883
01:41:28,207 --> 01:41:29,167
Oh, no. No.

1884
01:41:30,585 --> 01:41:31,586
We're different.

1885
01:41:32,587 --> 01:41:33,962
I am.

1886
01:41:34,255 --> 01:41:35,465
They are.

1887
01:41:35,631 --> 01:41:36,757
She is.

1888
01:41:36,925 --> 01:41:38,259
We're all different from you.

1889
01:41:38,842 --> 01:41:40,386
You see, we were born...

1890
01:41:40,845 --> 01:41:42,387
...different.

1891
01:41:43,347 --> 01:41:44,849
It's in our blood...

1892
01:41:45,225 --> 01:41:48,978
...and nothing that you do
or say or steal...

1893
01:41:49,395 --> 01:41:51,730
...or dream up can ever change that.

1894
01:41:52,606 --> 01:41:53,858
A girl like Daisy--

1895
01:41:54,024 --> 01:41:55,234
You shut up!

1896
01:41:55,400 --> 01:41:56,152

02:06:46,850 --> 02:06:48,560
<i>...hoping she'd wander in one night.

Gatsby's and guessed at his corruption...

2297
02:07:18,715 --> 02:07:19,381

The moon rose higher.

brooding on the old, unknown world...

2302
02:07:41,904 --> 02:07:43,948
<i>...I thought of Gatsby's wonder...

2303
02:07:44,114 --> 02:07:47,868
<i>...when he first picked out the green light
at the end of Daisy's dock.

2304

<i>He had come such a long way.

2305

must have seemed so close...

2307

<i>But he did not know...

2308
02:08:07,805 --> 02:08:09,932
<i>...that it was already behind him.

2309
02:08:11,768 --> 02:08:14,729
<i>Gatsby believed in the green light...

2310
02:08:14,938 --> 02:08:18,315
<i>...the orgastic future
that year by year recedes...

<i>...and one fine morning...

2316
02:08:31,537 --> 02:08:33,622
<i>So we beat on...

2317
02:08:34,082 --> 02:08:36,417

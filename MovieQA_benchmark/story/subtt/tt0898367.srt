00:00:05,115 --> 00:01:23,456


1
00:01:31,842 --> 00:01:33,509
What's happening?

2
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:37,013
-Why are you taking a bath?
-I'm not.

3
00:01:39,308 --> 00:01:40,391
Shit.

4
00:01:43,187 --> 00:01:45,813
We got to find a way out.
Everybody, come on.

5
00:01:45,898 --> 00:01:49,567
Where are you?

6
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:40,284
Papa!

7
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,002
It's okay. It's just another earthquake.

8
00:02:52,214 --> 00:02:53,840
I'm right here.

9
00:02:54,716 --> 00:02:55,758
Right here. Okay.

10
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:18,739
The clocks stopped at 1:17.

11
00:03:20,701 --> 00:03:23,578
There was a long shear of bright light,

12
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:26,831
then a series of low concussions.

13
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:36,883
I think it's October,

14
00:03:38,802 --> 00:03:40,636
but I can't be sure.

15
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:44,015
I haven't kept a calendar for years.

16
00:03:49,813 --> 00:03:52,857
Each day is more gray than the one before.

17
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:58,237
It is cold and growing colder
as the world slowly dies.

18
00:03:59,323 --> 00:04:03,409
No animals have survived,
and all the crops are long gone.

19
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:10,166
Soon all the trees in the world will fall.

20
00:04:19,176 --> 00:04:22,595
The roads are peopled
by refugees towing carts

21
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:25,014
and gangs carrying weapons,

22
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:28,100
looking for fuel and food.

23
00:04:49,915 --> 00:04:53,084
Within a year, there were fires on the ridges

24
00:04:53,168 --> 00:04:55,044
and deranged chanting.

25
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:04,303
There has been cannibalism.

26
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:07,264
Cannibalism is the great fear.

27
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:17,358
Mostly I worry about food, always food.

28
00:05:18,527 --> 00:05:21,153
Food and the cold and our shoes.

29
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:40,840
Sometimes I tell the boy old stories
of courage and justice,

30
00:05:41,508 --> 00:05:44,010
difficult as they are to remember.

31
00:05:44,886 --> 00:05:47,555
All I know is the child is my warrant,

32
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:53,310
and if he is not the word of God,
then God never spoke.

33
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:27,053
"...flea, you could land
on Lady Liberty's torch.

34
00:06:28,722 --> 00:06:31,766
"If you flicked your tongue like a chameleon,

35
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:34,560
"you could whip the food off your plate

36
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:36,437
"without using your hands.

37
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:38,939
"But what would your mother say?

38
00:06:39,691 --> 00:06:42,401
"If you craned your neck like a crane,

39
00:06:42,486 --> 00:06:45,821
"you'd have to stretch your arm way up

40
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:48,324
"to scratch your head.

41
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:55,164
"If you had eagle eyes,
you could spot a running rabbit."

42
00:08:03,358 --> 00:08:05,067
Let's take a look.

43
00:08:20,584 --> 00:08:23,752
There could be something here.
Corn or something.

44
00:08:24,421 --> 00:08:25,629
No.

45
00:08:27,257 --> 00:08:29,091
They ran out of food.

46
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:40,060
Maybe there's some hayseeds in the hayloft.

47
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:42,438
I doubt it.

48
00:08:57,746 --> 00:08:59,788
It's not what you think.

49
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:02,750
They committed suicide.

50
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:04,627
Why?

51
00:09:05,629 --> 00:09:07,129
You know why.

52
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:30,152
Two left. One for you, one for me.

53
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:47,002
You put it in your mouth
and you point it up,

54
00:09:48,171 --> 00:09:50,130
just like I showed you.

55
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:51,924
Okay.

56
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:54,009
-Like this.
-No.

57
00:09:56,179 --> 00:09:58,472
Then just pull the trigger.

58
00:09:58,556 --> 00:10:00,057
You got it?

59
00:10:03,186 --> 00:10:04,687
Is that okay?

60
00:10:05,814 --> 00:10:07,022
Okay.

61
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:36,218
Are you hungry?

62
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:39,096
-Thanks.
-Here you go.

63
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:42,474
-I'm thirsty.
-Thirsty? Some water?

64
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:44,143
Okay. Hey.

65
00:10:46,396 --> 00:10:48,063
You look pretty.

66
00:11:00,577 --> 00:11:01,994
Oh, no.

67
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:10,794
No.

68
00:11:19,763 --> 00:11:21,722
No, we don't have to do this.

69
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:24,600
-I don't want to do this.
-I think we do.

70
00:11:24,976 --> 00:11:26,685
No, I don't want to do this.

71
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:28,812
What kind of life is this?

72
00:11:29,439 --> 00:11:31,190
You got to push.

73
00:11:31,566 --> 00:11:32,566
No.

74
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:33,942
Come on,

75
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:37,863
push.

76
00:12:24,327 --> 00:12:25,869
Quick! Get up!

77
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,338
We got to run. Go. Stay low. Go, go.

78
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:40,259
-Papa. Papa.
-Let's go.

79
00:13:03,408 --> 00:13:05,742
Check those junkers over there.

80
00:13:06,494 --> 00:13:07,661
Shit.

81
00:13:17,714 --> 00:13:19,423
Where's your head?

82
00:13:50,914 --> 00:13:54,416
-Watch the damn cars up ahead.
-Jog along beside them.

83
00:13:59,756 --> 00:14:00,797
Damn it.

84
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,094
Don't look at them. Look at me.

85
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:09,139
You call out, you're dead.

86
00:14:09,641 --> 00:14:11,266
Where you from?

87
00:14:11,643 --> 00:14:13,227
Does it matter?

88
00:14:13,937 --> 00:14:15,562
Where you from?

89
00:14:16,606 --> 00:14:19,274
You got ammunition for those rifles?

90
00:14:20,443 --> 00:14:22,903
I told you not to look over there.

91
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:31,537
What are you eating?

92
00:14:31,621 --> 00:14:33,455
Whatever we can find.

93
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:35,624
Whatever you can find.

94
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:37,042
Yeah.

95
00:14:46,636 --> 00:14:49,096
You ain't gonna shoot that thing.

96
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:53,350
You ain't got but two shells. Maybe one.

97
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:57,646
-And they'll hear the shot.
-Maybe, but you won't,

98
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:04,236
because it'll be through your skull and
inside your brain before you can hear it.

99
00:15:04,487 --> 00:15:06,446
To hear it, you'll need a frontal lobe

100
00:15:06,531 --> 00:15:10,075
and things with names like colliculus
and temporal gyrus,

101
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:14,037
but you won't have them anymore
because they'll just be soup.

102
00:15:14,497 --> 00:15:16,081
You a doctor?

103
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:18,208
I'm not anything.

104
00:15:18,293 --> 00:15:21,461
We got a hurt man. It'd be worth your while.

105
00:15:24,257 --> 00:15:26,091
You look at him again
and I'll shoot you in the head.

106
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:29,428
That boy looks hungry.
Why don't y'all come on to the truck?

107
00:15:29,512 --> 00:15:31,597
Get you something to eat.

108
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:35,017
Ain't no need to be such a hard-ass.

109
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:38,770
You don't have anything to eat.

110
00:15:39,856 --> 00:15:41,690
Come on. Let's go.

111
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:44,151
I ain't going nowhere.

112
00:15:44,569 --> 00:15:46,737
You think I won't kill you?

113
00:15:49,741 --> 00:15:50,782
You're wrong.

114
00:15:50,867 --> 00:15:52,868
You know what I think?

115
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:55,871
I think you're chicken-shit.

116
00:15:56,414 --> 00:15:59,041
You never killed a man in your life.

117
00:16:12,347 --> 00:16:13,597
-Where'd that come from?
-Right there!

118
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:14,890
Who's shooting?

119
00:16:28,571 --> 00:16:30,405
Let's go. Come on.

120
00:16:31,741 --> 00:16:33,909
-At the tree line!
-Come on!

121
00:16:38,915 --> 00:16:41,792
-The two of you, that way.
-Move quicker.

122
00:16:41,876 --> 00:16:44,044
-Move!
-I think I see him. Let's go!

123
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:53,887
Over there!

124
00:17:17,412 --> 00:17:19,830
You're okay. I'm right here.

125
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:24,292
Let's go.

126
00:17:52,155 --> 00:17:55,323
I try to look like any common traveling killer,

127
00:17:57,285 --> 00:17:59,327
but my heart is hammering.

128
00:18:01,289 --> 00:18:03,373
When it comes to the boy,

129
00:18:05,168 --> 00:18:07,002
I have only one question.

130
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:11,298
Can you do it

131
00:18:13,176 --> 00:18:15,177
when the time comes?

132
00:18:19,974 --> 00:18:21,433
All right?

133
00:18:24,312 --> 00:18:26,313
I won't let anything happen to you.

134
00:18:26,481 --> 00:18:28,440
I'll take care of you.

135
00:18:35,198 --> 00:18:37,866
And I'll kill anyone who touches you,

136
00:18:40,703 --> 00:18:42,704
because that's my job.

137
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:17,072
You got to stop crying.

138
00:19:17,698 --> 00:19:19,449
We got to go now.

139
00:19:20,535 --> 00:19:22,661
We got to go find the cart.

140
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:30,752
Come on.

141
00:19:32,463 --> 00:19:34,047
Take the gun.

142
00:20:27,685 --> 00:20:29,811
That's all we have left.

143
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:34,316
I should've done it a long time ago.

144
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,984
I should've done it
when we had more bullets.

145
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:38,653
I don't know why I listened to you.

146
00:20:40,323 --> 00:20:44,159
They're gonna catch up with us
and they're going to kill us.

147
00:20:45,995 --> 00:20:49,331
They're gonna rape me,
and then they're gonna rape your son

148
00:20:49,415 --> 00:20:52,167
and they're gonna kill us and eat us.

149
00:20:52,835 --> 00:20:54,461
-Whatever it takes...
-Stop it.

150
00:20:54,545 --> 00:20:56,546
-I told you...
-Stop it!

151
00:20:58,382 --> 00:21:01,509
I will do anything. Anything.

152
00:21:03,721 --> 00:21:05,180
Like what?

153
00:21:12,021 --> 00:21:15,357
I don't even know why I ask you.
I should just go ahead

154
00:21:15,441 --> 00:21:18,985
and empty every goddamn bullet
into my brain and leave you with nothing.

155
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:23,114
-That's what I should do.
-Please don't talk like that.

156
00:21:27,203 --> 00:21:30,497
You're right.
There's nothing left to talk about.

157
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:37,420
My heart was ripped out of me
the night he was born.

158
00:21:42,426 --> 00:21:45,261
We have to. We will survive this.

159
00:21:45,346 --> 00:21:50,016
We are not gonna quit.
We're not gonna quit.

160
00:21:53,354 --> 00:21:55,605
I don't want to just survive.

161
00:21:56,774 --> 00:21:58,525
Don't you get it?

162
00:21:59,402 --> 00:22:01,111
I don't want to.

163
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:09,035
Why won't you let me take him with me?

164
00:22:10,538 --> 00:22:12,122
Don't touch it.

165
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:18,503
I would take him with me
if it weren't for you. You know that.

166
00:22:19,255 --> 00:22:20,922
Listen to yourself.

167
00:22:23,426 --> 00:22:24,968
You sound

168
00:22:27,805 --> 00:22:29,222
crazy.

169
00:22:51,871 --> 00:22:54,122
Other families are doing it.

170
00:23:25,654 --> 00:23:27,447
Let's go take a bath.

171
00:24:04,819 --> 00:24:06,152
Listen,

172
00:24:07,154 --> 00:24:08,863
we have to talk.

173
00:24:11,408 --> 00:24:13,368
That man back there...

174
00:24:17,164 --> 00:24:20,208
There's not many good guys left, that's all.

175
00:24:21,418 --> 00:24:25,046
We have to watch out for the bad guys.
We have to just

176
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:28,633
keep carrying the fire.

177
00:24:33,681 --> 00:24:35,390
What fire?

178
00:24:36,725 --> 00:24:38,601
The fire inside you.

179
00:24:48,237 --> 00:24:50,071
Are we still the good guys?

180
00:24:50,156 --> 00:24:52,574
Yes, we're still the good guys.

181
00:24:53,242 --> 00:24:54,826
Of course we are.

182
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:57,579
And we always will be?

183
00:24:58,497 --> 00:25:00,623
No matter what happens?

184
00:25:02,626 --> 00:25:04,377
Always will be.

185
00:25:29,612 --> 00:25:31,112
What is it?

186
00:25:33,449 --> 00:25:35,283
It's a treat for you.

187
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:48,963
Go ahead.

188
00:26:11,487 --> 00:26:13,196
It's really good.

189
00:26:14,323 --> 00:26:17,200
-You should have some.
-No, you drink it.

190
00:26:18,577 --> 00:26:20,662
I want you to have some.

191
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:24,916
It's bubbly.

192
00:26:39,181 --> 00:26:40,807
It's for you.

193
00:26:51,193 --> 00:26:52,527
Come on.

194
00:26:55,864 --> 00:26:57,282
I'm coming.

195
00:27:34,403 --> 00:27:35,903
I'm hungry.

196
00:27:36,572 --> 00:27:38,406
I know. So am I.

197
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:45,413
And we're still heading south?

198
00:27:46,582 --> 00:27:47,665
Of course.

199
00:27:50,085 --> 00:27:51,336
There might be food there.

200
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:54,881
Everything depends
on reaching the coast, okay?

201
00:27:56,925 --> 00:27:58,051
Okay.

202
00:28:06,435 --> 00:28:08,519
I wish I was with my mom.

203
00:28:15,569 --> 00:28:17,904
You mean you wish you were dead?

204
00:28:19,406 --> 00:28:20,656
Yeah.

205
00:28:25,579 --> 00:28:28,790
You mustn't say that. It's a bad thing to say.

206
00:28:32,795 --> 00:28:34,629
I can't help it.

207
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:37,465
You have to stop thinking about her.

208
00:28:39,134 --> 00:28:40,802
We both do.

209
00:28:45,432 --> 00:28:47,141
How do we do that?

210
00:29:00,114 --> 00:29:02,907
You did it right. You did it right.

211
00:31:14,122 --> 00:31:17,208
Aren't you at least
gonna say goodbye to him?

212
00:31:17,292 --> 00:31:18,876
-No.
-No?

213
00:31:18,961 --> 00:31:21,629
No.

214
00:31:23,131 --> 00:31:25,049
-Why not?
-I can't.

215
00:31:26,593 --> 00:31:29,136
Why can't you stay till morning?

216
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:34,433
Because I can't.

217
00:31:34,977 --> 00:31:36,561
Can't you spend one more night with me?

218
00:31:36,645 --> 00:31:38,604
-No, I have to go.
-Why?

219
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:42,733
Why do you have to go?

220
00:31:42,818 --> 00:31:46,320
Why? Why do you have to go?

221
00:31:54,496 --> 00:32:03,921
What am I gonna tell him?

222
00:32:12,222 --> 00:32:13,306
God.

223
00:32:13,473 --> 00:32:14,932
You go south.

224
00:32:15,309 --> 00:32:16,350
No.

225
00:32:16,602 --> 00:32:19,353
You keep him warm and you go south.

226
00:32:21,857 --> 00:32:24,692
You won't survive another winter here.

227
00:32:33,285 --> 00:32:35,369
Why won't you help me?

228
00:32:36,872 --> 00:32:39,624
Where are you going?
You can't even see out there.

229
00:32:39,708 --> 00:32:42,376
I don't need to. I don't need to see.

230
00:32:46,048 --> 00:32:47,798
-I'm begging...
-Don't.

231
00:32:48,467 --> 00:32:50,092
-Please.
-No.

232
00:32:51,219 --> 00:32:52,386
Don't.

233
00:33:00,437 --> 00:33:01,771
She was gone,

234
00:33:03,315 --> 00:33:06,275
and the coldness of it was her final gift.

235
00:33:08,862 --> 00:33:11,405
But she died somewhere in the dark.

236
00:33:14,326 --> 00:33:16,702
There is no other tale to tell.

237
00:33:35,555 --> 00:33:37,890
Look, there's colors.

238
00:33:43,814 --> 00:33:45,648
You want to go in?

239
00:33:52,197 --> 00:33:53,614
I got you!

240
00:34:27,399 --> 00:34:28,649
Come on.

241
00:34:58,013 --> 00:34:59,180
Papa.

242
00:35:26,291 --> 00:35:28,626
There's a reason this is locked.

243
00:36:02,244 --> 00:36:03,911
Come help me.

244
00:36:17,592 --> 00:36:19,593
Nothing's gonna happen.

245
00:36:35,527 --> 00:36:36,944
It's okay.

246
00:36:54,296 --> 00:36:55,629
What's that?

247
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:05,723
Oh, my God.

248
00:37:05,807 --> 00:37:10,269
Help us. Please, will you help us?

249
00:37:13,523 --> 00:37:16,025
-Help us.
-Let's go! Let's go!

250
00:37:17,319 --> 00:37:18,819
Help me.

251
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:20,571
Wait! Wait!

252
00:37:21,323 --> 00:37:24,158
They're taking us to the smokehouse.

253
00:37:25,869 --> 00:37:27,161
Go, go!

254
00:37:28,455 --> 00:37:30,372
-Stop!
-Wait!

255
00:37:36,129 --> 00:37:38,172
No. No. No!

256
00:37:39,341 --> 00:37:40,424
No.

257
00:38:19,464 --> 00:38:21,882
Bad guys. Bad men.

258
00:38:24,052 --> 00:38:26,095
Bad men. Bad guys.

259
00:38:29,683 --> 00:38:31,642
Who left this window open?

260
00:38:31,726 --> 00:38:34,269
-I leave it open for the smell.
-What smell?

261
00:38:34,354 --> 00:38:36,772
-You don't smell it anymore?
-Who wants a drink?

262
00:38:37,023 --> 00:38:38,273
Don't waste the wine.

263
00:38:45,573 --> 00:38:48,826
Yeah, it's gonna keep raining.
It's gonna rain all day.

264
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:51,036
I'm going up to change.

265
00:38:52,205 --> 00:38:53,872
They're bad guys.

266
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:55,582
Bad guys.

267
00:38:56,584 --> 00:38:57,918
-Take it.
-No. No.

268
00:38:58,003 --> 00:38:59,753
-Take it! Take it. Take it.
-No.

269
00:38:59,921 --> 00:39:02,506
Don't be afraid. Don't be afraid.

270
00:39:04,926 --> 00:39:09,430
When they get hold of you, you're gonna
have to do it just like everybody else.

271
00:39:11,558 --> 00:39:15,269
You have to be brave. You have to!
You know how to do it.

272
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:17,646
-You know how.
-Be right up.

273
00:39:17,731 --> 00:39:19,690
Bad guys. Bad men.

274
00:39:24,821 --> 00:39:26,655
What are you doing?

275
00:39:28,450 --> 00:39:30,242
I'm so sorry.

276
00:39:33,705 --> 00:39:35,664
Will I see you again?

277
00:39:36,583 --> 00:39:39,209
When will I see you? No.

278
00:39:39,294 --> 00:39:40,961
What's going on?

279
00:39:41,296 --> 00:39:43,005
What the hell is that?

280
00:39:43,089 --> 00:39:44,465
Hey!

281
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:51,638
Fuck!

282
00:39:52,265 --> 00:39:54,391
He was out of the cellar. I pushed it over.

283
00:39:55,518 --> 00:39:56,977
God damn it.

284
00:39:59,647 --> 00:40:02,608
-Come on!
-Where do you think you're going?

285
00:41:04,337 --> 00:41:06,421
-Hey, hold him.
-I got him!

286
00:41:07,882 --> 00:41:09,716
You son of a bitch!

287
00:41:28,069 --> 00:41:29,987
Hey, come on. Wake up.

288
00:41:30,738 --> 00:41:32,406
Wake up. Wake up.

289
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:34,992
We got to get out of here.

290
00:41:35,076 --> 00:41:37,744
-We got to go now. We got to get away.
-Get off me.

291
00:41:37,912 --> 00:41:39,246
Come on.

292
00:41:41,124 --> 00:41:42,583
Let's run.

293
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:51,884
Last one.

294
00:42:07,609 --> 00:42:10,444
We would never eat anybody, would we?

295
00:42:12,822 --> 00:42:14,948
No, of course not.

296
00:42:18,411 --> 00:42:20,662
No matter how hungry we were?

297
00:42:23,249 --> 00:42:25,292
Even if we were starving?

298
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:27,586
We're starving now.

299
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:31,465
Because we're the good guys.

300
00:42:33,343 --> 00:42:34,551
Yes.

301
00:42:35,136 --> 00:42:37,429
And we're carrying the fire.

302
00:42:42,769 --> 00:42:44,019
Yes.

303
00:43:01,329 --> 00:43:02,746
This way.

304
00:43:07,835 --> 00:43:09,878
What is this place, Papa?

305
00:43:12,006 --> 00:43:14,091
The house where I grew up.

306
00:43:30,024 --> 00:43:31,525
That's me.

307
00:43:39,284 --> 00:43:43,453
This is where we used to have
our Christmas tree when I was a boy.

308
00:43:52,547 --> 00:43:55,465
And here's where we'd hang our stockings.

309
00:44:00,138 --> 00:44:01,305
It's...

310
00:44:11,733 --> 00:44:14,443
I don't think we should be doing this.

311
00:44:26,539 --> 00:44:28,623
You want to wait outside?

312
00:46:08,683 --> 00:46:10,058
No, wait!

313
00:46:10,309 --> 00:46:12,144
-Hey!
-Wait!

314
00:46:14,355 --> 00:46:15,897
Wait! Come on!

315
00:46:16,441 --> 00:46:19,067
-I'm not gonna hurt you.
-Hey. Hey.

316
00:46:21,404 --> 00:46:22,779
-What are you doing?
-No.

317
00:46:22,864 --> 00:46:24,364
What are you doing?

318
00:46:24,449 --> 00:46:26,408
-What are you doing?
-What?

319
00:46:26,492 --> 00:46:29,327
-There's a little boy, Papa!
-What little boy? What are you...

320
00:46:29,412 --> 00:46:31,163
-I saw a little boy!
-What the hell are you doing?

321
00:46:31,247 --> 00:46:32,831
I saw a little boy.

322
00:46:32,915 --> 00:46:36,042
-There's no boy. What boy?
-Get off. There is! Just like me.

323
00:46:37,128 --> 00:46:38,587
-Come on.
-No!

324
00:46:39,505 --> 00:46:40,464
Hey!

325
00:46:40,548 --> 00:46:44,134
-Stop it! You scared the hell out of me.
-No!

326
00:46:44,218 --> 00:46:47,012
-Come on, let's go. Stop it.
-I need to see him!

327
00:46:47,221 --> 00:46:49,139
Hey! What the hell...

328
00:46:50,224 --> 00:46:52,058
-What the hell are you doing?
-What?

329
00:46:53,895 --> 00:46:55,228
-I need to!
-Why?

330
00:46:55,313 --> 00:46:56,897
I just do!

331
00:46:58,441 --> 00:46:59,608
Stop it.

332
00:46:59,692 --> 00:47:01,318
He's right there.

333
00:47:01,527 --> 00:47:03,069
I understand.

334
00:47:03,571 --> 00:47:06,573
-I understand. It's okay.
-Right there.

335
00:47:10,745 --> 00:47:12,412
It's gonna be all right.

336
00:47:25,468 --> 00:47:28,595
He imagines how things will be at the coast,

337
00:47:29,764 --> 00:47:33,058
and that there will be other children there.

338
00:47:33,142 --> 00:47:35,936
He asks me what happened to my friends,

339
00:47:36,020 --> 00:47:39,940
and I tell him they died and that I miss them.

340
00:47:46,072 --> 00:47:48,156
When I have nothing else,

341
00:47:48,658 --> 00:47:51,952
I try to dream the dreams
of a child's imaginings.

342
00:48:12,848 --> 00:48:14,724
Are we gonna die now?

343
00:48:20,898 --> 00:48:23,400
What do you think is gonna happen?

344
00:48:24,902 --> 00:48:28,488
You think we're just gonna
suddenly keel over and die?

345
00:48:28,948 --> 00:48:30,782
It takes a long time

346
00:48:31,617 --> 00:48:33,785
to die of starvation.

347
00:49:05,067 --> 00:49:06,985
Every day is a lie,

348
00:49:08,070 --> 00:49:10,155
but I am slowly dying.

349
00:49:10,865 --> 00:49:12,574
That is not a lie.

350
00:49:15,578 --> 00:49:18,997
I'm trying to prepare him
for the day when I'm gone.

351
00:49:34,055 --> 00:49:36,598
Nothing you haven't seen before.

352
00:50:47,795 --> 00:50:53,133
Papa!

353
00:50:57,430 --> 00:50:58,930
-What?
-Papa.

354
00:50:59,140 --> 00:51:00,640
What's wrong?

355
00:51:01,642 --> 00:51:02,809
Look.

356
00:51:04,979 --> 00:51:06,563
We look skinny.

357
00:51:08,399 --> 00:51:09,983
We are skinny.

358
00:51:12,820 --> 00:51:15,321
Come on. Let's get out of here.

359
00:51:44,435 --> 00:51:46,853
Your mother played really well.

360
00:51:48,105 --> 00:51:49,773
I don't remember.

361
00:51:52,026 --> 00:51:53,401
Well, that was

362
00:51:54,111 --> 00:51:55,278
before.

363
00:52:39,114 --> 00:52:40,907
-Don't.
-It's okay.

364
00:52:41,742 --> 00:52:43,326
Please, Papa.

365
00:52:43,702 --> 00:52:44,953
Please.

366
00:52:46,997 --> 00:52:48,331
It's okay.

367
00:52:58,801 --> 00:53:00,218
Oh, my God.

368
00:53:02,263 --> 00:53:03,847
Come down here.

369
00:53:06,976 --> 00:53:08,476
Come down.

370
00:53:08,561 --> 00:53:10,311
What did you find?

371
00:53:10,688 --> 00:53:12,105
Everything.

372
00:53:13,107 --> 00:53:14,941
I found everything.

373
00:53:28,038 --> 00:53:29,956
What is all this stuff?

374
00:53:30,666 --> 00:53:31,875
Food.

375
00:53:33,168 --> 00:53:34,544
It's food.

376
00:53:35,796 --> 00:53:38,756
Here. See? Can you read the label?

377
00:53:42,011 --> 00:53:43,303
"Pears."

378
00:53:43,804 --> 00:53:45,680
Yes, pears.

379
00:53:54,023 --> 00:53:56,399
What do you want for breakfast?

380
00:54:16,003 --> 00:54:17,045
What?

381
00:54:17,171 --> 00:54:20,340
Nothing.

382
00:54:20,841 --> 00:54:23,343
Is it okay for us to take all this?

383
00:54:25,095 --> 00:54:26,095
Yeah.

384
00:54:26,639 --> 00:54:27,805
They'd want us to.

385
00:54:32,561 --> 00:54:34,646
Shouldn't we thank them?

386
00:54:34,730 --> 00:54:36,356
Yeah, go ahead.

387
00:54:43,781 --> 00:54:45,198
Like this?

388
00:54:48,911 --> 00:54:50,912
Thank you for

389
00:54:52,206 --> 00:54:53,498
soup

390
00:54:54,041 --> 00:54:56,376
and Cheetas.

391
00:54:57,920 --> 00:54:59,087
Cheetos.

392
00:54:59,171 --> 00:55:01,714
And all this stuff,

393
00:55:02,383 --> 00:55:03,633
people.

394
00:55:06,971 --> 00:55:08,388
That's good.

395
00:55:09,515 --> 00:55:10,932
Your turn.

396
00:55:16,772 --> 00:55:19,357
Thank you, people.

397
00:56:01,567 --> 00:56:03,067
You like that?

398
00:56:10,159 --> 00:56:12,452
We did good, didn't we, Papa?

399
00:56:14,788 --> 00:56:15,955
Yeah.

400
00:56:26,467 --> 00:56:34,807
Go to sleep.

401
00:58:59,369 --> 00:59:00,536
What?

402
00:59:02,956 --> 00:59:04,248
Don't...

403
00:59:06,293 --> 00:59:08,127
Don't touch my stuff.

404
00:59:08,670 --> 00:59:11,088
Okay, sorry.

405
00:59:42,996 --> 00:59:44,413
Now I'll give you a treat.

406
00:59:44,498 --> 00:59:46,874
-What?
-Keep your eyes closed.

407
00:59:46,959 --> 00:59:48,501
How does that feel?

408
00:59:48,585 --> 00:59:51,337
Shampoo.

409
00:59:55,008 --> 00:59:56,259
Better?

410
00:59:57,177 --> 00:59:58,302
Yep.

411
01:00:26,164 --> 01:00:27,707
How do I look?

412
01:00:33,046 --> 01:00:34,839
What do you think?

413
01:00:57,154 --> 01:00:58,738
Can I try some?

414
01:01:00,073 --> 01:01:02,199
-Why?
-You won't like it.

415
01:01:06,204 --> 01:01:08,039
Makes you feel funny.

416
01:01:17,257 --> 01:01:18,591
You okay?

417
01:01:27,434 --> 01:01:30,603
You think I come from another world,
don't you?

418
01:01:35,692 --> 01:01:36,942
Sort of.

419
01:01:47,996 --> 01:01:49,538
What was that?

420
01:01:55,379 --> 01:01:57,380
It sounded like a dog.

421
01:02:08,642 --> 01:02:10,309
It's not a dog.

422
01:02:12,354 --> 01:02:13,562
It is.

423
01:02:15,190 --> 01:02:16,649
It is a dog.

424
01:02:17,859 --> 01:02:19,485
If it's a dog,

425
01:02:21,113 --> 01:02:23,030
it'll be with someone.

426
01:02:23,615 --> 01:02:24,698
But who?

427
01:02:26,868 --> 01:02:28,411
I don't know.

428
01:02:29,454 --> 01:02:31,831
I'm not waiting to find out.

429
01:02:31,915 --> 01:02:33,332
-Come on.
-No, I don't want to go.

430
01:02:33,417 --> 01:02:35,418
It's not safe here anymore.

431
01:02:35,502 --> 01:02:37,461
-But...
-We're going.

432
01:02:39,798 --> 01:02:42,800
What are we gonna do with all this stuff?

433
01:02:42,884 --> 01:02:45,511
We'll just have to take what we can.

434
01:02:46,263 --> 01:02:49,140
You always think bad things
are gonna happen.

435
01:02:49,224 --> 01:02:51,267
But we found this place.

436
01:02:57,858 --> 01:02:59,108
Blankets on the cart.

437
01:03:07,993 --> 01:03:09,452
I see him.

438
01:03:38,231 --> 01:03:40,608
I don't have anything for you.

439
01:03:40,692 --> 01:03:42,776
You can look if you want.

440
01:03:43,361 --> 01:03:45,237
I got nothing.

441
01:03:45,322 --> 01:03:46,989
We're not robbers.

442
01:03:47,073 --> 01:03:48,240
What?

443
01:03:52,496 --> 01:03:54,663
I said we're not robbers.

444
01:03:54,748 --> 01:03:56,499
Well, what are you?

445
01:03:56,583 --> 01:03:58,459
We're just like you.

446
01:03:58,543 --> 01:04:02,213
-Well, what are you following me for?
-We're not following you.

447
01:04:02,589 --> 01:04:06,467
-We've got food we could give him.
-He's not getting any food.

448
01:04:06,885 --> 01:04:09,637
-He's scared, Papa.
-Everybody's scared.

449
01:04:11,640 --> 01:04:13,182
Please, Papa.

450
01:04:15,268 --> 01:04:16,644
All right.

451
01:04:17,562 --> 01:04:18,938
Just one.

452
01:04:30,784 --> 01:04:31,951
Here,

453
01:04:32,410 --> 01:04:33,744
take it.

454
01:04:41,670 --> 01:04:44,922
-What about a spoon?
-He's not getting a spoon.

455
01:04:49,594 --> 01:04:50,678
You

456
01:04:52,389 --> 01:04:53,681
pull it.

457
01:04:55,350 --> 01:04:56,809
You got to

458
01:04:58,103 --> 01:04:59,895
eat it. It's good.

459
01:05:17,205 --> 01:05:18,706
He's hungry.

460
01:05:19,624 --> 01:05:20,958
I see it.

461
01:05:22,294 --> 01:05:26,005
And I know what you're gonna ask me,
and the answer is no.

462
01:05:27,132 --> 01:05:28,924
What's the question?

463
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:32,511
We can't keep him.

464
01:05:48,069 --> 01:05:50,529
You want to have dinner with us?

465
01:05:52,699 --> 01:05:55,618
I don't know. What do I have to do?

466
01:05:56,202 --> 01:05:58,370
You don't have to do anything.

467
01:05:58,455 --> 01:06:01,373
-Can you walk okay?
-Yeah, I can.

468
01:06:02,542 --> 01:06:04,793
-Help him.
-You help him.

469
01:06:05,503 --> 01:06:06,712
I can't.

470
01:06:07,005 --> 01:06:08,422
I can walk.

471
01:06:08,757 --> 01:06:10,549
No, I can walk.

472
01:06:23,563 --> 01:06:25,230
How old are you?

473
01:06:25,857 --> 01:06:27,107
I'm 90.

474
01:06:28,109 --> 01:06:29,860
Ninety, my ass.

475
01:06:30,236 --> 01:06:32,821
Is that what you tell people
so they don't hurt you?

476
01:06:35,408 --> 01:06:37,701
-Does it work?
-Nope.

477
01:06:42,374 --> 01:06:44,083
What's your name?

478
01:06:44,584 --> 01:06:46,710
-Ely.
-"Ely"?

479
01:06:47,253 --> 01:06:49,338
What's wrong with Ely?

480
01:06:49,422 --> 01:06:51,340
Don't hold his hand.

481
01:07:18,118 --> 01:07:21,412
That little boy, is he your little boy?

482
01:07:23,206 --> 01:07:24,540
Your son?

483
01:07:26,084 --> 01:07:27,835
-Yeah.
-What's it look like?

484
01:07:28,211 --> 01:07:30,921
I don't know. I can't see real good.

485
01:07:33,550 --> 01:07:35,551
-Is that right?
-Yeah.

486
01:07:38,221 --> 01:07:39,847
Can you see me?

487
01:07:39,931 --> 01:07:42,641
No, but I can tell somebody's there.

488
01:07:43,685 --> 01:07:44,935
Yeah.

489
01:07:47,230 --> 01:07:50,065
-Okay.
-Good little boy. Yeah.

490
01:07:50,817 --> 01:07:52,776
-Okay, time for you to go to sleep.
-No.

491
01:07:52,861 --> 01:07:54,027
Yes.

492
01:07:54,362 --> 01:07:56,363
-Good night.
-Good night.

493
01:07:57,365 --> 01:07:59,408
-Good night.
-Go to sleep.

494
01:07:59,492 --> 01:08:01,285
Good night, son.

495
01:08:10,170 --> 01:08:12,421
You can see that, can't you?

496
01:08:13,339 --> 01:08:14,631
Yeah.

497
01:08:22,682 --> 01:08:24,600
When I saw that boy,

498
01:08:27,771 --> 01:08:30,022
I thought I'd died and he...

499
01:08:30,857 --> 01:08:32,566
He was an angel.

500
01:08:34,194 --> 01:08:36,069
I had a boy one time

501
01:08:37,113 --> 01:08:38,655
of my own.

502
01:08:46,331 --> 01:08:50,793
I never thought I'd see a child again,
never thought that would

503
01:08:51,294 --> 01:08:52,795
happen to me.

504
01:08:53,505 --> 01:08:55,130
He is an angel.

505
01:08:56,800 --> 01:08:58,592
To me, he's a god.

506
01:09:01,429 --> 01:09:03,639
But I hope that's not true.

507
01:09:04,599 --> 01:09:07,935
To be on the road with the last god like that

508
01:09:09,395 --> 01:09:11,230
would be nothing

509
01:09:14,025 --> 01:09:16,193
but a dangerous situation.

510
01:09:20,532 --> 01:09:22,658
What happened to your son?

511
01:09:29,165 --> 01:09:31,166
I can't talk about it.

512
01:09:34,838 --> 01:09:37,172
Not with you, anyway.

513
01:09:49,936 --> 01:09:53,397
I knew this was coming,
this or something like it.

514
01:09:53,940 --> 01:09:55,816
There were warnings.

515
01:09:57,652 --> 01:10:01,446
Yeah, some people thought it was a con.
I always believed in it.

516
01:10:02,532 --> 01:10:03,532
Yeah.

517
01:10:03,616 --> 01:10:07,035
-Did you try to get ready for it?
-What would you do?

518
01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:10,789
Even if you knew what to do,
you wouldn't know what to do.

519
01:10:11,165 --> 01:10:12,833
But supposing

520
01:10:17,046 --> 01:10:19,548
you were the last man left alive?

521
01:10:22,969 --> 01:10:26,096
How would you know that,
that you were the last man alive?

522
01:10:26,180 --> 01:10:29,600
Well, I don't guess you'd know it.
You'd just be it.

523
01:10:36,566 --> 01:10:38,400
Maybe God would know.

524
01:10:38,902 --> 01:10:40,986
God wouldn't know what...

525
01:10:41,696 --> 01:10:44,489
God wouldn't know what he knows.

526
01:10:44,949 --> 01:10:49,328
If there is a God up there, he would
have turned his back on us by now.

527
01:10:49,787 --> 01:10:53,916
And whoever made humanity
will find no humanity here.

528
01:10:54,459 --> 01:10:56,668
No, sir. No, sir.

529
01:10:57,378 --> 01:10:58,754
So beware.

530
01:10:59,589 --> 01:11:00,839
Beware.

531
01:11:02,550 --> 01:11:04,885
Do you ever wish you would die?

532
01:11:05,887 --> 01:11:07,012
No.

533
01:11:07,388 --> 01:11:10,807
It's foolish to ask for luxuries
in times like these.

534
01:11:18,733 --> 01:11:22,069
-He's gonna die and you don't care.
-I care enough.

535
01:11:23,863 --> 01:11:28,200
Maybe when we run out of food,
you'll have more time to think about it.

536
01:11:28,618 --> 01:11:32,037
Yeah, well, you always say,
"Watch out for bad guys."

537
01:11:32,372 --> 01:11:36,792
That old man wasn't a bad guy.
You can't even tell anymore.

538
01:11:50,098 --> 01:11:52,015
That'll keep it safe.

539
01:11:53,226 --> 01:11:56,228
-Do you know where we are?
-About 1 00 miles from the coast,

540
01:11:56,312 --> 01:11:58,063
as the crow flies.

541
01:11:58,856 --> 01:12:00,691
"As the crow flies"?

542
01:12:02,068 --> 01:12:05,362
It means going in a straight line,

543
01:12:05,446 --> 01:12:06,822
which we can't.

544
01:12:06,906 --> 01:12:09,324
There aren't any crows, are there?

545
01:12:09,409 --> 01:12:12,494
-Just in books.
-Yep, just in books.

546
01:12:13,162 --> 01:12:16,248
Do you think
there could be crows somewhere?

547
01:12:16,332 --> 01:12:18,291
I think it's unlikely.

548
01:12:19,043 --> 01:12:21,586
Could they fly to Mars or someplace?

549
01:12:24,173 --> 01:12:26,425
You know what? Let's go back.

550
01:12:40,106 --> 01:12:41,606
What is it?

551
01:12:45,319 --> 01:12:47,612
Let's go. Let's go. Run. Run.

552
01:12:54,912 --> 01:12:56,371
Go! Go!

553
01:12:58,958 --> 01:13:01,001
No. No!

554
01:13:01,085 --> 01:13:02,294
Let's go.

555
01:13:02,378 --> 01:13:05,047
-No!
-Let's go. Let's go. Run.

556
01:13:38,956 --> 01:13:40,665
Hey! Hey! Hold on!

557
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:42,167
Stop!

558
01:13:45,838 --> 01:13:47,172
In there!

559
01:13:47,632 --> 01:13:49,508
Keep your head down!

560
01:14:08,277 --> 01:14:10,487
It's okay. It's okay.

561
01:14:13,199 --> 01:14:14,658
-It's okay.
-No!

562
01:14:15,368 --> 01:14:16,827
It's okay.

563
01:14:25,378 --> 01:14:26,962
It's gone now.

564
01:15:59,138 --> 01:16:01,014
I had a bad dream.

565
01:16:11,108 --> 01:16:16,279
Stop.

566
01:16:21,911 --> 01:16:24,996
I tell him, "When you dream
about bad things happening,

567
01:16:25,081 --> 01:16:28,667
"it shows you're still fighting.
You're still alive.

568
01:16:30,461 --> 01:16:33,463
"It's when you start
to dream about good things

569
01:16:33,547 --> 01:16:36,132
"that you should start to worry."

570
01:16:41,514 --> 01:16:42,931
Here?

571
01:16:43,015 --> 01:16:44,057
No,

572
01:16:44,892 --> 01:16:47,060
we're closer than you think.

573
01:16:49,188 --> 01:16:50,563
That's us,

574
01:16:51,774 --> 01:16:53,817
and this is all the sea.

575
01:16:57,863 --> 01:16:59,030
This?

576
01:17:01,951 --> 01:17:03,368
Is it blue?

577
01:17:04,662 --> 01:17:06,037
The sea?

578
01:17:06,914 --> 01:17:08,498
I don't know,

579
01:17:09,208 --> 01:17:10,625
used to be.

580
01:17:38,904 --> 01:17:40,030
Wait.

581
01:17:57,506 --> 01:17:59,549
I'm sorry it's not blue.

582
01:18:07,892 --> 01:18:11,227
We'll be all right.
We'll just keep heading south.

583
01:18:15,524 --> 01:18:17,609
What's on the other side?

584
01:18:21,238 --> 01:18:22,614
Nothing.

585
01:18:24,658 --> 01:18:27,160
There has to be something.

586
01:18:28,079 --> 01:18:30,038
Maybe there's a father

587
01:18:31,290 --> 01:18:34,959
and his little boy,
and they're sitting on a beach, too.

588
01:18:47,640 --> 01:18:49,140
You all right?

589
01:18:49,225 --> 01:18:51,476
-What is it? What is it?
-I don't feel too...

590
01:18:52,978 --> 01:18:54,145
Jesus!

591
01:18:56,607 --> 01:18:58,316
You're burning up.

592
01:19:02,238 --> 01:19:03,238
Sorry.

593
01:19:03,322 --> 01:19:05,990
It's okay. You didn't do anything wrong.

594
01:19:11,288 --> 01:19:18,920
I'm right here.

595
01:19:26,679 --> 01:19:28,763
Can I ask you a question?

596
01:19:30,057 --> 01:19:31,433
Of course.

597
01:19:36,814 --> 01:19:39,023
What would you do if I died?

598
01:19:45,197 --> 01:19:46,656
If you died,

599
01:19:49,493 --> 01:19:51,453
I'd want to die, too.

600
01:19:53,873 --> 01:19:55,957
So you could be with me?

601
01:19:56,041 --> 01:19:57,167
Yeah,

602
01:19:58,127 --> 01:20:00,128
so I could be with you.

603
01:20:22,401 --> 01:20:24,235
What are you doing?

604
01:20:25,571 --> 01:20:27,197
I'm going out to that boat.

605
01:20:27,281 --> 01:20:28,823
What are you gonna do?

606
01:20:28,908 --> 01:20:31,034
See what I can find for us.

607
01:20:33,954 --> 01:20:36,581
Here. You keep a good lookout.

608
01:20:37,958 --> 01:20:39,209
Okay?

609
01:20:40,336 --> 01:20:41,461
Okay.

610
01:20:42,588 --> 01:20:43,922
Stay warm.

611
01:22:01,709 --> 01:22:03,960
Hey! What the hell happened?

612
01:22:05,087 --> 01:22:07,630
-I'm sorry!
-They took everything!

613
01:22:08,173 --> 01:22:09,549
Our food,

614
01:22:11,093 --> 01:22:12,468
my shoes.

615
01:22:15,014 --> 01:22:16,639
Son of a bitch!

616
01:22:18,851 --> 01:22:20,935
-It's okay. Listen, it's okay.
-I'm sorry.

617
01:22:21,020 --> 01:22:22,353
-It's okay.
-I didn't mean to.

618
01:22:22,438 --> 01:22:23,605
-It's okay.
-I fell asleep.

619
01:22:23,689 --> 01:22:25,982
Listen, don't lose heart.
We're gonna get it back.

620
01:23:05,773 --> 01:23:09,275
Get away from the cart. Put the knife down.

621
01:23:09,360 --> 01:23:11,903
Fuck you. I ain't putting down shit.

622
01:23:15,032 --> 01:23:18,242
-God damn you.
-Papa, please don't kill the man!

623
01:23:18,786 --> 01:23:20,078
Please.

624
01:23:28,253 --> 01:23:29,671
All right.

625
01:23:33,384 --> 01:23:35,593
All right, I done what you said.

626
01:23:35,678 --> 01:23:37,845
-Please, Papa.
-Listen to the boy.

627
01:23:37,930 --> 01:23:39,514
-How long you been following us?
-Following you?

628
01:23:39,598 --> 01:23:42,433
-How long?
-Nobody been fucking following you.

629
01:23:42,518 --> 01:23:46,729
I saw the cart in the sand, just took it,
that's all. I ain't touch the boy.

630
01:23:46,814 --> 01:23:48,356
-Take your clothes off.
-No.

631
01:23:48,440 --> 01:23:51,776
-Take them off! Every goddamn stitch.
-You don't want to do this.

632
01:23:51,860 --> 01:23:54,654
-Do it.
-All right. All right. All right.

633
01:23:55,155 --> 01:23:57,532
-Just take it easy.
-I'll kill you.

634
01:23:57,616 --> 01:23:59,617
Right where you stand.

635
01:24:00,285 --> 01:24:02,328
I don't want no trouble.

636
01:24:11,213 --> 01:24:12,839
Please, mister.

637
01:24:15,634 --> 01:24:17,719
You ain't got to do this.

638
01:24:24,476 --> 01:24:27,645
And the shoes. Throw them in the cart.

639
01:24:29,398 --> 01:24:31,357
Throw them in the cart!

640
01:24:36,321 --> 01:24:37,572
Do it.

641
01:24:44,371 --> 01:24:46,581
You ain't got to do this to me, man.

642
01:24:46,665 --> 01:24:48,833
You ain't got to do me like this.

643
01:24:48,917 --> 01:24:51,252
-You didn't mind doing it to us.
-I'm begging.

644
01:24:51,336 --> 01:24:52,378
-I'm begging, please.
-Papa!

645
01:24:52,463 --> 01:24:54,464
Listen to the boy, man.

646
01:24:54,757 --> 01:24:56,340
I is starving.

647
01:24:57,384 --> 01:24:59,594
You'd have done the same thing.

648
01:24:59,678 --> 01:25:01,387
I'll die out here.

649
01:25:03,766 --> 01:25:05,600
I'm gonna die out here, man.

650
01:25:05,684 --> 01:25:08,686
I'm gonna leave you just the way you left us.

651
01:25:10,856 --> 01:25:12,565
Help me pull the cart.

652
01:25:12,649 --> 01:25:14,192
Pull the cart!

653
01:25:16,069 --> 01:25:18,613
What do you think would've happened
if we hadn't caught him?

654
01:25:18,697 --> 01:25:20,865
-You've got to learn.
-I don't want to learn!

655
01:25:20,949 --> 01:25:23,659
I'm not gonna be around forever!

656
01:25:23,744 --> 01:25:27,622
Sooner or later,
you're gonna have to look after yourself.

657
01:25:27,706 --> 01:25:30,041
Help me with the goddamn cart!

658
01:25:46,767 --> 01:25:48,851
Would you stop sulking?

659
01:25:50,062 --> 01:25:51,437
He's gone.

660
01:25:53,106 --> 01:25:55,149
-He's not gone.
-What do you want me to do?

661
01:25:55,234 --> 01:25:57,068
Just help him, Papa.

662
01:25:58,570 --> 01:26:00,112
Just help him.

663
01:26:00,739 --> 01:26:02,406
He's just hungry.

664
01:26:04,284 --> 01:26:05,827
He's gonna die.

665
01:26:05,911 --> 01:26:07,912
He's gonna die anyway.

666
01:26:08,956 --> 01:26:10,665
He was so scared.

667
01:26:11,083 --> 01:26:13,751
I'm scared. You understand?

668
01:26:14,419 --> 01:26:15,837
I'm scared.

669
01:26:19,091 --> 01:26:22,385
You're not the one that has to worry
about everything.

670
01:26:22,469 --> 01:26:23,761
I am so.

671
01:26:24,388 --> 01:26:26,681
What? What'd you say?

672
01:26:27,766 --> 01:26:29,350
Yes, I am!

673
01:26:32,604 --> 01:26:34,230
I am the one!

674
01:26:37,109 --> 01:26:38,276
Okay?

675
01:26:51,874 --> 01:26:53,082
Okay.

676
01:26:53,166 --> 01:26:54,792
Help me push.

677
01:26:58,130 --> 01:27:04,302
Hello?

678
01:28:13,372 --> 01:28:14,538
Papa.

679
01:28:16,708 --> 01:28:19,919
-What? What do you got there?
-Look.

680
01:28:20,671 --> 01:28:23,130
-What is it?
-It's a beetle.

681
01:28:24,758 --> 01:28:25,967
Look.

682
01:28:32,599 --> 01:28:33,933
Get down!

683
01:28:39,231 --> 01:28:40,481
Papa!

684
01:28:40,565 --> 01:28:42,233
Son of a bitch!

685
01:28:52,661 --> 01:28:55,371
No. No! Papa!

686
01:29:19,938 --> 01:29:22,106
Cock-sucking motherfucker!

687
01:29:23,316 --> 01:29:24,817
Who else is here?

688
01:29:24,901 --> 01:29:27,028
You piece of shit!

689
01:29:27,112 --> 01:29:28,696
Why are you following us?

690
01:29:28,780 --> 01:29:31,115
We weren't following anybody.

691
01:29:32,242 --> 01:29:34,744
You were following us.

692
01:30:22,542 --> 01:30:24,043
Right there.

693
01:30:27,255 --> 01:30:29,381
Right there. Right there.

694
01:30:32,511 --> 01:30:33,677
Fuck.

695
01:31:07,379 --> 01:31:12,758
Wait.

696
01:31:27,649 --> 01:31:28,732
No.

697
01:31:37,242 --> 01:31:39,160
We have to leave it.

698
01:31:41,204 --> 01:31:43,122
I can't do it anymore.

699
01:32:15,155 --> 01:32:16,822
If I were God,

700
01:32:18,366 --> 01:32:20,993
I would've made the world just so,

701
01:32:23,038 --> 01:32:24,788
and no different.

702
01:32:29,336 --> 01:32:31,295
And so I have you.

703
01:32:37,594 --> 01:32:39,053
I have you.

704
01:33:43,159 --> 01:33:57,131
You're okay.

705
01:33:57,841 --> 01:34:00,217
Don't get too comfortable here.

706
01:34:00,969 --> 01:34:02,928
You need to keep going.

707
01:34:06,933 --> 01:34:09,685
You don't know
what might be down the road.

708
01:34:09,769 --> 01:34:10,978
No.

709
01:34:11,229 --> 01:34:13,647
No, you're gonna be okay, Papa.

710
01:34:13,732 --> 01:34:16,900
-You have to.
-This has been a long time coming.

711
01:34:21,740 --> 01:34:24,366
Just keep... Just keep going south.

712
01:34:27,120 --> 01:34:29,580
Do everything the way we did it.

713
01:34:30,540 --> 01:34:32,041
Keep the gun

714
01:34:32,709 --> 01:34:34,376
with you, always.

715
01:34:35,754 --> 01:34:38,255
Don't let anyone take it from you.

716
01:34:42,218 --> 01:34:46,722
You need to find the good guys,
but you can't take any chances.

717
01:34:47,932 --> 01:34:49,433
You hear me?

718
01:34:51,478 --> 01:34:53,604
But I want to be with you.

719
01:34:55,940 --> 01:34:58,108
I want to be with you, too,

720
01:34:58,735 --> 01:35:00,194
but I can't.

721
01:35:00,612 --> 01:35:03,280
You have to... You have to let me go.

722
01:35:04,115 --> 01:35:05,240
No.

723
01:35:06,368 --> 01:35:08,577
Just take me with you,

724
01:35:09,329 --> 01:35:10,621
please.

725
01:35:14,167 --> 01:35:15,876
I thought I could.

726
01:35:17,629 --> 01:35:19,671
-Please, Papa.
-I can't do it.

727
01:35:19,798 --> 01:35:21,548
What should I do?

728
01:35:21,633 --> 01:35:23,759
Just hold my hand.

729
01:35:28,515 --> 01:35:30,933
You said you wouldn't leave me.

730
01:35:34,270 --> 01:35:35,562
I know.

731
01:35:37,899 --> 01:35:39,358
I'm sorry.

732
01:35:43,905 --> 01:35:45,322
Oh, my boy.

733
01:35:46,116 --> 01:35:47,366
My boy.

734
01:35:51,121 --> 01:35:53,122
You have my whole heart.

735
01:35:55,792 --> 01:35:57,418
You always did.

736
01:36:38,793 --> 01:36:39,918
Papa.

737
01:36:45,300 --> 01:36:46,425
No.

738
01:36:49,512 --> 01:36:56,435
Papa.

739
01:39:23,958 --> 01:39:26,376
Where's that man you were with?

740
01:39:35,470 --> 01:39:37,220
Is he your father?

741
01:39:38,514 --> 01:39:41,016
Yes, he was my papa.

742
01:39:41,559 --> 01:39:44,311
I think maybe you should come with me.

743
01:39:49,567 --> 01:39:51,735
Are you one of the good guys?

744
01:39:51,819 --> 01:39:54,863
Yeah, I'm one of the good guys.
Why don't you put that pistol away?

745
01:39:54,947 --> 01:39:58,992
I'm not supposed to let anyone
take it from me, no matter what.

746
01:39:59,077 --> 01:40:03,330
I don't want your pistol,
I just don't want you pointing it at me.

747
01:40:16,552 --> 01:40:19,096
You see, you got two choices here.

748
01:40:20,223 --> 01:40:23,767
You can stay here with your papa
or you can go with me.

749
01:40:25,561 --> 01:40:28,772
If you stay here,
you need to keep off the road.

750
01:40:34,112 --> 01:40:36,238
How do I know you're one of the good guys?

751
01:40:36,322 --> 01:40:39,324
You don't. You'll just have to take a shot.

752
01:40:46,958 --> 01:40:48,834
Do you have any kids?

753
01:40:50,420 --> 01:40:51,878
Yes, we do.

754
01:40:54,549 --> 01:40:56,633
Do you have a little boy?

755
01:40:57,343 --> 01:41:00,137
We have a little boy and a little girl.

756
01:41:00,805 --> 01:41:02,097
How old is he?

757
01:41:02,181 --> 01:41:04,933
About your age, maybe a little older.

758
01:41:07,311 --> 01:41:09,396
And you didn't eat them?

759
01:41:09,897 --> 01:41:11,106
No.

760
01:41:12,150 --> 01:41:14,359
So, you don't eat people?

761
01:41:14,444 --> 01:41:16,528
No, we don't eat people.

762
01:41:19,824 --> 01:41:20,991
And

763
01:41:22,452 --> 01:41:24,536
are you carrying the fire?

764
01:41:25,329 --> 01:41:26,705
Am I what?

765
01:41:27,165 --> 01:41:28,915
Carrying the fire.

766
01:41:33,129 --> 01:41:35,380
You're kind of weirded out, aren't you, kid?

767
01:41:35,465 --> 01:41:37,340
Well, are you?

768
01:41:38,342 --> 01:41:40,510
Yeah, I'm carrying the fire.

769
01:41:41,512 --> 01:41:43,555
And I can come with you?

770
01:41:44,140 --> 01:41:45,682
Yes, you can.

771
01:42:06,746 --> 01:42:08,955
I'll talk to you every day.

772
01:42:13,044 --> 01:42:14,920
And I won't forget,

773
01:42:16,839 --> 01:42:18,507
no matter what.

774
01:42:25,681 --> 01:42:27,599
No matter what, Papa.

775
01:42:57,380 --> 01:42:59,297
I'm so glad to see you.

776
01:43:01,175 --> 01:43:03,927
We were following you. Did you know that?

777
01:43:05,555 --> 01:43:07,681
We saw you with your papa.

778
01:43:10,434 --> 01:43:12,102
I'm so lucky.

779
01:43:17,525 --> 01:43:19,693
I was so worried about you,

780
01:43:20,152 --> 01:43:23,196
and now we don't have to worry
about a thing.

781
01:43:25,157 --> 01:43:27,617
How's that sound? Is that okay?

782
01:43:45,136 --> 01:43:46,469
Okay.

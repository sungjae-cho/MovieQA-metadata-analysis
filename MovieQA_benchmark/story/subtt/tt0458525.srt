1
00:00:50,446 --> 00:00:52,072
You're always sick.

2
00:00:53,324 --> 00:00:55,534
You were sick when
you were my age.

3
00:00:58,037 --> 00:00:59,496
Evening, sir.

4
00:01:00,789 --> 00:01:01,707
Evening, Victor.

5
00:01:02,021 --> 00:01:03,794
I didn't realize that
you're still here.

6
00:01:05,711 --> 00:01:07,838
I'm just keeping
James company, sir.

7
00:01:08,048 --> 00:01:09,508
If that's all right...

8
00:01:11,467 --> 00:01:13,344
Very kind of you.

9
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:17,473
- Are you better, son?
- Still cold, father.

10
00:01:17,473 --> 00:01:20,059
It's just a mild fever, you'll
be all right in the morning.

11
00:01:20,351 --> 00:01:21,810
You always say that.

12
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:24,731
And you always pull
through, don't you?

13
00:01:25,981 --> 00:01:29,193
Now... take your medicine.

14
00:01:30,152 --> 00:01:31,946
<i>Elizabeth.</i>

15
00:01:32,238 --> 00:01:33,697
<i>Elizabeth.</i>

16
00:01:33,697 --> 00:01:35,658
Your father's drunk again.

17
00:01:35,658 --> 00:01:37,535
You should help him home, Victor.

18
00:01:37,535 --> 00:01:40,204
It's not my name
he's calling, sir.

19
00:01:41,622 --> 00:01:43,874
- Father!
- Stay where you are, James!

20
00:01:44,166 --> 00:01:45,793
Father!

21
00:01:49,463 --> 00:01:51,090
<i>I told you never
to come back here!</i>

22
00:02:19,827 --> 00:02:21,662
James...

23
00:02:21,662 --> 00:02:23,330
There are things you
don't understand.

24
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:24,540
- Don't...
- I need him them to know!

25
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:25,207
Please no!

26
00:02:25,207 --> 00:02:26,375
- No... more... lies!

27
00:02:26,375 --> 00:02:27,293
James...

28
00:02:46,145 --> 00:02:47,813
James!

29
00:02:53,027 --> 00:02:56,280
He... he wasn't your father...

30
00:03:04,288 --> 00:03:05,080
...son.

31
00:03:14,256 --> 00:03:16,175
What are you?

32
00:03:30,981 --> 00:03:33,817
- I didn't mean it! I didn't--
- Yes, you did!

33
00:03:35,319 --> 00:03:38,989
He deserved it!
And you gave it to him.

34
00:03:41,242 --> 00:03:44,703
We're brothers, Jimmy.
You realize that?

35
00:03:44,703 --> 00:03:46,872
Brothers protect each other.

36
00:03:47,498 --> 00:03:48,999
You have to be hard now.

37
00:03:48,999 --> 00:03:52,086
Hard enough they
can't ever touch us.

38
00:03:52,336 --> 00:03:53,879
I want to go home.

39
00:03:53,879 --> 00:03:54,588
We can't.

40
00:03:54,798 --> 00:03:57,300
We stick together
no matter what.

41
00:03:57,633 --> 00:04:00,427
And take care of anyone
who gets in our way.

42
00:04:00,761 --> 00:04:03,264
Can you do that, little brother?

43
00:04:07,434 --> 00:04:11,605
They're coming.
Can you run? Okay.

44
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:17,152
Keep on running.
Don't look back.

45
00:06:26,381 --> 00:06:28,758
Enough! Enough!

46
00:06:41,576 --> 00:06:43,119
Stand down, soldier!

47
00:06:49,347 --> 00:06:51,391
Victor!

48
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,600
Stand down !

49
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:02,635
No!

50
00:07:28,117 --> 00:07:28,910
Ready!

51
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:31,412
Aim!

52
00:07:31,829 --> 00:07:33,539
Wake me when it's over.

53
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,672
Fire!

54
00:07:53,285 --> 00:07:55,579
My name is Major William Stryker.

55
00:07:55,579 --> 00:07:58,999
You've been charged with killing a senior officer.

56
00:07:58,999 --> 00:08:00,793
Is that correct?

57
00:08:00,793 --> 00:08:03,128
Apparently we have some
issues with authority.

58
00:08:03,128 --> 00:08:04,380
Just keep a lid on it.

59
00:08:05,256 --> 00:08:06,215
Sir.

60
00:08:07,049 --> 00:08:09,260
The warden tells me that your
sentence was carried out...

61
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:11,554
by a firing squad at 1000 hours.

62
00:08:11,846 --> 00:08:14,765
- How'd that go?
- It tickled.

63
00:08:19,103 --> 00:08:21,480
You boys tired of running?

64
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:24,358
Tired of denying your... true nature?

65
00:08:24,358 --> 00:08:26,777
- What do you care?
- Oh, I care...

66
00:08:27,695 --> 00:08:29,613
I care cause I know
how special you are...

67
00:08:30,489 --> 00:08:31,782
how valuable.

68
00:08:35,995 --> 00:08:36,829
Look.

69
00:08:37,329 --> 00:08:40,791
You can stay here, locked
up like freaks of nature...

70
00:08:41,417 --> 00:08:43,586
or you can join me.

71
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:45,713
I'm putting together
a special team...

72
00:08:46,027 --> 00:08:48,842
with special privileges.

73
00:08:49,258 --> 00:08:50,196
Now tell me...

74
00:08:50,406 --> 00:08:53,847
How would you like to
really serve your country?

75
00:09:07,735 --> 00:09:10,237
I love this weapon more than
anything in the whole wide world.

76
00:09:10,237 --> 00:09:11,614
- You wanna know why?
- No.

77
00:09:12,823 --> 00:09:14,575
It's memorable.

78
00:09:14,783 --> 00:09:17,244
Sure, it's a little bulky,
to have to get 'em on a plane.

79
00:09:17,244 --> 00:09:18,704
You whip out a
couple of swords...

80
00:09:18,914 --> 00:09:20,373
at your ex-girlfriend's wedding...

81
00:09:20,373 --> 00:09:23,042
they will never, ever forget it.

82
00:09:23,334 --> 00:09:24,543
That's funny, Wade.

83
00:09:24,753 --> 00:09:27,047
I think you confused me with
someone who gives a shit.

84
00:09:28,505 --> 00:09:29,402
Right, it is...

85
00:09:29,612 --> 00:09:31,593
it's probably not as
intimidating as having a gun or...

86
00:09:32,134 --> 00:09:35,596
bone claws or the
fingernails of a bag lady...

87
00:09:44,188 --> 00:09:48,108
- Manicure?
- Victor... easy.

88
00:09:49,172 --> 00:09:51,987
Fred got a new tattoo.
I'm concerned.

89
00:09:53,113 --> 00:09:55,699
Oh geez, Fred, you
just met her last night.

90
00:09:56,242 --> 00:09:58,994
- I love her.
- You love her after one night?

91
00:09:58,994 --> 00:10:01,580
She's a gymnast.

92
00:10:02,248 --> 00:10:04,083
Bradley, take her down.

93
00:10:10,256 --> 00:10:11,653
Are you gonna puke?

94
00:10:11,903 --> 00:10:13,968
If we were meant to fly,
we'd have grown wings.

95
00:10:14,197 --> 00:10:16,116
Oh, don't worry man. See, more
people die driving than flying.

96
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:17,304
How about from impaling?

97
00:10:17,638 --> 00:10:21,267
Hey, be nice.
Or be your approximation of nice.

98
00:10:22,726 --> 00:10:24,144
Would you like a bucket?

99
00:10:24,562 --> 00:10:27,231
Gentlemen, wheels
down in Lagos in five.

100
00:11:02,433 --> 00:11:06,937
- Why are we here?
- All in good time. Zero...

101
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,354
<i>Intruder !</i>

102
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,300
<i>Man your weapons !</i>

103
00:11:49,459 --> 00:11:53,213
Having fun yet?

104
00:11:59,066 --> 00:12:01,277
- Fred...
- The tank?

105
00:12:01,277 --> 00:12:04,572
- Tank.
- Yeah, I got that.

106
00:12:38,627 --> 00:12:40,295
Great!

107
00:12:40,545 --> 00:12:43,256
Stuck in an elevator with five
guys on a high protein diet.

108
00:12:43,256 --> 00:12:45,008
- Oh Wade!
- Dreams really do come true.

109
00:12:45,008 --> 00:12:47,010
Would you just shut it!
You're up next.

110
00:12:47,344 --> 00:12:49,346
Thank you, sir.
You look very nice today.

111
00:12:49,346 --> 00:12:50,305
It's the green.

112
00:12:50,305 --> 00:12:52,099
Brings out the seriousness
in your eyes.

113
00:12:52,099 --> 00:12:54,017
Oh my God, do you
ever shut up, pal?

114
00:12:54,227 --> 00:12:55,895
No, not when I'm awake.

115
00:12:56,728 --> 00:12:59,648
Bradley? Top floor, please.

116
00:13:07,489 --> 00:13:09,533
Cover the elevator!
The elevator!

117
00:13:20,127 --> 00:13:21,920
Time to go to work.

118
00:13:58,165 --> 00:13:59,750
Okay!

119
00:14:00,125 --> 00:14:02,002
People are dead!

120
00:14:04,338 --> 00:14:06,152
If you haven't that
mouth on you, Wade...

121
00:14:06,361 --> 00:14:07,717
you'd be the perfect soldier.

122
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I wouldn't do that if I were you, brother.

123
00:14:20,228 --> 00:14:23,231
Take the diamonds, they're yours.

124
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:24,775
I don't want your diamonds.

125
00:14:26,109 --> 00:14:27,319
I want this.

126
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,782
That? That is nothing. A souvenir.

127
00:14:31,782 --> 00:14:35,327
Where did you find it?
I want the source.

128
00:14:35,744 --> 00:14:41,458
A small village, far inland,
three days from here.

129
00:14:43,335 --> 00:14:47,089
Tell him that this rock is more
valuable to me than his life.

130
00:14:47,089 --> 00:14:48,465
Ask him where he found it.

131
00:15:02,187 --> 00:15:04,356
He says it came from the sky.

132
00:15:08,068 --> 00:15:10,028
He's telling the truth.

133
00:15:10,862 --> 00:15:12,385
You don't know
their language, Logan.

134
00:15:12,594 --> 00:15:13,950
It's a meteor fragment.

135
00:15:14,178 --> 00:15:15,471
I know what it is.

136
00:15:15,681 --> 00:15:17,036
I'm asking him
where he found it.

137
00:15:17,577 --> 00:15:19,997
Sir, base wants to
know our location.

138
00:15:20,247 --> 00:15:21,039
Shut him down.

139
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:26,607
Tell him everyone here will die...

140
00:15:26,921 --> 00:15:29,424
unless he tells me where
he found the rock.

141
00:15:39,558 --> 00:15:43,061
- He said that is sacred.
- Okay, fine.

142
00:15:46,481 --> 00:15:48,275
Victor...

143
00:16:04,875 --> 00:16:06,585
Victor!

144
00:16:09,963 --> 00:16:11,506
Don't even think about it!

145
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:14,801
We didn't sign up for this.

146
00:16:19,014 --> 00:16:21,391
Put him down.

147
00:16:33,195 --> 00:16:35,238
What are you doing?

148
00:16:36,323 --> 00:16:37,345
We finally got a good
thing going here.

149
00:16:37,554 --> 00:16:38,701
Don't you screw this up.

150
00:16:38,701 --> 00:16:40,369
Enough, it's enough.
We've done enough.

151
00:16:40,682 --> 00:16:42,664
Who do you think you are?

152
00:16:43,038 --> 00:16:45,248
This is what we do.

153
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:47,751
Maybe you'd rather be rotting
in a hole somewhere

154
00:16:47,751 --> 00:16:49,711
till they figure out a way
to do it to us, is that it?

155
00:16:50,087 --> 00:16:50,921
Uh?

156
00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:53,715
I'm done.

157
00:16:56,051 --> 00:16:58,595
You coming?

158
00:17:04,101 --> 00:17:05,978
Jimmy!

159
00:17:10,941 --> 00:17:12,442
We can't just let
you walk away!

160
00:17:22,035 --> 00:17:23,412
Jimmy!

161
00:17:25,872 --> 00:17:27,791
Jimmy!

162
00:18:16,632 --> 00:18:18,925
Why are you up so early?

163
00:18:21,178 --> 00:18:23,263
Come here.

164
00:19:01,468 --> 00:19:03,178
See you baby.

165
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,458
Hey.

166
00:19:11,937 --> 00:19:14,106
Oh, that's nice! Yeah!

167
00:19:41,174 --> 00:19:42,843
No. Come on.

168
00:20:01,903 --> 00:20:03,739
Hey, what do you do?

169
00:20:06,283 --> 00:20:07,993
You turn off the light,
you win a prize.

170
00:20:08,619 --> 00:20:11,371
- Two tries for a buck.
- Come on, I wanna do it!

171
00:20:18,795 --> 00:20:20,672
Um, that's obvious.

172
00:20:24,092 --> 00:20:26,428
That's two.

173
00:20:34,144 --> 00:20:39,191
- That's a stupid trick.
- It's not a trick, man.

174
00:20:39,566 --> 00:20:41,318
C'mon.
Freak !

175
00:20:43,278 --> 00:20:44,696
Bye!

176
00:21:13,308 --> 00:21:15,102
Show's over!

177
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:22,818
I said, show's over!

178
00:21:27,155 --> 00:21:30,492
The show is never
over for us, Bradley.

179
00:21:32,286 --> 00:21:35,622
- Victor.
- Aren't you gonna invite me in?

180
00:21:37,332 --> 00:21:39,960
Yeah, come on in.

181
00:21:52,264 --> 00:21:53,682
You know, I've never
said anything...

182
00:21:54,683 --> 00:21:57,185
to anyone...about what happened.

183
00:21:57,894 --> 00:22:00,564
I'm living a totally different life now,
but uh...

184
00:22:00,564 --> 00:22:02,858
No need to bring up the past.

185
00:22:17,956 --> 00:22:20,208
You know,

186
00:22:20,584 --> 00:22:24,338
I always thought it would be Wade
coming knocking at my door.

187
00:22:27,132 --> 00:22:30,510
Well, Wade's gone.

188
00:22:34,431 --> 00:22:37,059
I'm not afraid of you, Victor.

189
00:22:39,102 --> 00:22:41,188
I'm not afraid to die.

190
00:22:42,481 --> 00:22:47,402
How do you know?
You've never tried it before.

191
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:07,631
Was it the wars?

192
00:23:08,173 --> 00:23:12,260
- Which one?
- All of 'em.

193
00:23:19,685 --> 00:23:22,187
Tell me.

194
00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:25,691
It's just a scratch.

195
00:23:32,364 --> 00:23:35,409
Looks like we're gonna need
new sheets again, baby.

196
00:23:35,409 --> 00:23:37,160
Yeah...

197
00:24:01,852 --> 00:24:04,021
Who the hell is this?

198
00:24:04,021 --> 00:24:06,273
It smells like government.

199
00:24:10,319 --> 00:24:12,654
My God!
Haven't aged a day!

200
00:24:12,654 --> 00:24:14,406
Clean living.

201
00:24:14,406 --> 00:24:16,283
You remember Agent Zero.

202
00:24:16,283 --> 00:24:18,910
Still shooting first and
asking questions later?

203
00:24:20,412 --> 00:24:22,789
You still chewing
those cheap cigars?

204
00:24:22,789 --> 00:24:27,252
Boys, please.
I have a job for you.

205
00:24:27,252 --> 00:24:29,671
- I already have a job.
- Lumberjack.

206
00:24:29,671 --> 00:24:32,049
- Eighteen grand a year?
- Eighteen five.

207
00:24:32,049 --> 00:24:34,301
Plus I haven't had
to kill anyone in a while.

208
00:24:34,301 --> 00:24:36,511
- Start to miss it?
- Yeah, right now I am.

209
00:24:36,511 --> 00:24:39,431
Zero, back to the car.

210
00:24:41,808 --> 00:24:43,477
Attaboy.

211
00:24:50,150 --> 00:24:53,362
You know, I'm not proud about
the way things ended between us.

212
00:24:53,362 --> 00:24:55,280
Conversation's over.

213
00:24:56,740 --> 00:24:58,617
Play the little house
on the prairie with a...

214
00:24:58,826 --> 00:24:59,869
a school teacher.

215
00:25:00,702 --> 00:25:02,037
That's just isn't you, Logan.

216
00:25:02,537 --> 00:25:03,872
And you would know, huh?

217
00:25:04,998 --> 00:25:05,791
I would.

218
00:25:06,291 --> 00:25:07,417
What do you want, Stryker?

219
00:25:09,336 --> 00:25:11,338
Bradley was killed
three days ago.

220
00:25:12,923 --> 00:25:15,550
Wade, before that.

221
00:25:15,550 --> 00:25:18,762
I believe that someone is
hunting down our old team.

222
00:25:19,763 --> 00:25:21,431
Anyone else?

223
00:25:21,431 --> 00:25:24,226
As far as I know,
Victor is safe.

224
00:25:25,644 --> 00:25:30,190
- Whoever it is, he's had names, addresses...
- I can take care of myself.

225
00:25:32,234 --> 00:25:34,361
This is not about you, Logan.

226
00:25:38,073 --> 00:25:40,117
Your country needs you.

227
00:25:40,993 --> 00:25:42,661
I'm Canadian.

228
00:25:43,745 --> 00:25:46,790
I know you, Logan!
I know who you are!

229
00:26:24,369 --> 00:26:26,371
What's wrong?

230
00:26:28,248 --> 00:26:29,791
Stryker came by today.

231
00:26:31,335 --> 00:26:32,669
Don't worry, I said no.

232
00:26:32,669 --> 00:26:35,547
Why is he bothering you
after all these years?

233
00:26:35,881 --> 00:26:38,342
Because I'm the best
there is at what I do.

234
00:26:38,342 --> 00:26:40,427
And what I do best
isn't very nice.

235
00:26:40,427 --> 00:26:43,555
You're not an animal, Logan.
What you have is a gift.

236
00:26:43,555 --> 00:26:44,473
A gift?

237
00:26:44,995 --> 00:26:47,602
You can return a gift.

238
00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:01,823
Come on, fellas!

239
00:27:04,576 --> 00:27:08,955
- Stay in the car.
- I'm just gonna ask nicely.

240
00:27:13,085 --> 00:27:15,337
Mind lettin' us go by?

241
00:27:15,712 --> 00:27:17,109
You're in some kind
of a hurry there, pal?

242
00:27:17,568 --> 00:27:18,256
Are ya?

243
00:27:18,924 --> 00:27:20,446
Just move your truck
so we can go by...

244
00:27:20,656 --> 00:27:22,428
Trying to have a
conversation there, right.

245
00:27:22,428 --> 00:27:23,741
If you start something...

246
00:27:23,951 --> 00:27:25,515
you'd better be
ready to finish it.

247
00:27:26,139 --> 00:27:27,599
Hey guys, take it easy!

248
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,000
Calm down.

249
00:27:33,689 --> 00:27:35,002
Your boyfriend's
got a big mouth.

250
00:27:35,212 --> 00:27:35,942
I know.

251
00:27:36,817 --> 00:27:40,988
Big temper too,
so please, let us pass.

252
00:27:45,409 --> 00:27:46,743
Thank you!

253
00:27:49,746 --> 00:27:51,164
How did you do that?

254
00:27:51,915 --> 00:27:54,167
You know, power of
persuasion is a gift.

255
00:27:54,584 --> 00:27:57,796
I see, do you... uh, have
those powers over me?

256
00:27:58,046 --> 00:28:01,216
Well, you didn't stay
in the car, did you?

257
00:28:17,941 --> 00:28:20,193
Why is the moon so lonely?

258
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:22,779
Why?

259
00:28:23,071 --> 00:28:25,407
Because she used
to have a lover.

260
00:28:25,407 --> 00:28:27,826
- You tell this to the kids?
- No.

261
00:28:28,910 --> 00:28:30,370
His name was Kuekuatsheu...

262
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:32,144
and they lived in the
spirit world together.

263
00:28:32,435 --> 00:28:34,333
- Ah, it's a true story.
- Right.

264
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,712
And every night, they would
wander the skies together.

265
00:28:39,379 --> 00:28:43,800
But... one of the other
spirits was jealous.

266
00:28:44,134 --> 00:28:47,429
Trickster, one of the
moons from South,

267
00:28:47,429 --> 00:28:51,558
so he told Kuekuatsheu that
the moon had asked for flowers.

268
00:28:51,933 --> 00:28:53,664
He told him to come
to our world...

269
00:28:53,874 --> 00:28:55,647
and pick up some wild roses...

270
00:28:55,937 --> 00:28:57,481
But Kuekuatsheu didn't know...

271
00:28:57,690 --> 00:28:59,776
that once you leave
the spirit world...

272
00:29:00,609 --> 00:29:03,320
you can never go back.

273
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:06,135
And every night,
he looks up in the sky...

274
00:29:06,553 --> 00:29:09,577
and sees the moon
and howls her name.

275
00:29:12,954 --> 00:29:13,747
But...

276
00:29:16,333 --> 00:29:17,960
...he can never touch her again.

277
00:29:21,463 --> 00:29:24,216
Koo-koo-Kachooka
got screwed.

278
00:29:25,550 --> 00:29:27,594
Kuekuatsheu.

279
00:29:33,934 --> 00:29:37,646
Means the Wolverine.

280
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:39,082
What you're doing, Logan?

281
00:31:34,054 --> 00:31:35,931
Kayla!

282
00:32:39,494 --> 00:32:42,122
You're not from
around here, are you?

283
00:32:47,002 --> 00:32:48,795
What gave me away?

284
00:32:53,175 --> 00:32:54,947
You got insurance
on this place?

285
00:32:55,157 --> 00:32:56,512
Insurance?

286
00:32:57,137 --> 00:32:57,887
No.

287
00:32:59,014 --> 00:33:00,724
Too bad.

288
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:03,000
<i>Victor !</i>

289
00:33:15,489 --> 00:33:19,326
Well, well, well...
Look what the cat dragged in.

290
00:33:19,576 --> 00:33:22,704
Guys, whatever this is,
take it outside.

291
00:33:33,465 --> 00:33:34,905
- Why?
- Why?

292
00:33:41,807 --> 00:33:44,768
You don't call,
you don't write.

293
00:33:44,768 --> 00:33:49,523
How else am I supposed
to get your attention?

294
00:34:28,353 --> 00:34:30,209
I hate to say it, Jimmy.

295
00:34:30,419 --> 00:34:32,817
But, frankly, I'm a
little disappointed.

296
00:34:34,484 --> 00:34:35,986
Stay down.

297
00:35:14,086 --> 00:35:18,132
Tell me something, Jimmy,
was she worth it?

298
00:35:37,443 --> 00:35:38,945
When are you
gonna figure it out?

299
00:35:40,510 --> 00:35:43,117
We're not like them.

300
00:35:45,243 --> 00:35:47,641
I... am nothing like you.

301
00:35:48,059 --> 00:35:49,727
Sure you are.

302
00:35:50,771 --> 00:35:54,212
You just don't know it yet.

303
00:36:07,077 --> 00:36:09,746
- What do we got?
- Bar fight. Multiple knife wounds.

304
00:36:12,457 --> 00:36:14,543
What? Is this a joke?
The guy's fine.

305
00:36:14,543 --> 00:36:16,128
Where is he?

306
00:36:16,128 --> 00:36:16,837
I said where is he!

307
00:36:16,837 --> 00:36:17,796
I don't know who he is.

308
00:36:18,442 --> 00:36:20,987
I can help you.

309
00:36:26,659 --> 00:36:27,931
Six years I've been here.

310
00:36:28,141 --> 00:36:30,643
No one knew me and
then you show up.

311
00:36:30,934 --> 00:36:34,083
- And the next day, she's dead!
- I tried to warn you.

312
00:36:34,083 --> 00:36:35,772
Why don't you tell
me it was Victor?

313
00:36:35,982 --> 00:36:37,129
I didn't know.

314
00:36:40,756 --> 00:36:44,594
I swear on my son's life!
I didn't...

315
00:36:51,455 --> 00:36:53,999
Victor's appetites were
becoming too public.

316
00:36:53,999 --> 00:36:57,461
I had to lock him up.
He thought I'd betrayed him.

317
00:36:57,669 --> 00:36:58,983
Went AWOL.

318
00:36:59,193 --> 00:37:01,799
He said he was
coming after all of us.

319
00:37:02,132 --> 00:37:03,633
You didn't come to warn me.

320
00:37:03,843 --> 00:37:05,511
You came to save
your own ass.

321
00:37:06,261 --> 00:37:08,347
So what's your plan, captain?

322
00:37:08,347 --> 00:37:10,182
You can't beat him, Logan,
you know you can't.

323
00:37:10,474 --> 00:37:12,225
I'm gonna find him
and kill him.

324
00:37:13,810 --> 00:37:16,146
I can give you the
tools to defeat him.

325
00:37:20,484 --> 00:37:25,530
- So we can still save the others.
- You mean save yourself, right?

326
00:37:26,573 --> 00:37:28,700
I promise you two things:

327
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:31,912
You'll suffer more pain than
any other man can endure,

328
00:37:31,912 --> 00:37:34,498
but you'll have your revenge.

329
00:37:36,667 --> 00:37:40,629
If I come with you,
I'm coming for blood.

330
00:37:41,713 --> 00:37:44,800
No law, no code of conduct.

331
00:37:45,175 --> 00:37:49,262
You point me in the right direction
and you get the hell out of my way.

332
00:38:29,094 --> 00:38:29,928
When it starts,

333
00:38:30,470 --> 00:38:33,640
whatever the reason is
that you're doing this,

334
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:36,852
focus on that.
Maybe it will help.

335
00:38:36,852 --> 00:38:39,521
Trust me, I've been
through worse.

336
00:38:39,521 --> 00:38:41,023
No, you haven't.

337
00:38:42,316 --> 00:38:43,400
We're ready.

338
00:38:45,527 --> 00:38:47,446
We're gonna make
you indestructible.

339
00:38:47,655 --> 00:38:50,575
but first, we're gonna
have to destroy you.

340
00:38:53,535 --> 00:38:57,080
Remember what we
were looking for in Africa?

341
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:58,040
I remember.

342
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:58,957
Well, I found it.

343
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:05,339
It helped us create a...
metal compound so strong

344
00:39:05,339 --> 00:39:08,383
that you will be able to
withstand virtually anything.

345
00:39:08,383 --> 00:39:11,136
It's called Adamantium.

346
00:39:12,054 --> 00:39:15,182
I can't put Victor
down myself, Logan.

347
00:39:15,891 --> 00:39:20,812
To kill him, you're gonna have
to embrace the other side.

348
00:39:22,314 --> 00:39:24,524
Become the animal.

349
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:27,944
Let's do this.

350
00:39:28,695 --> 00:39:30,072
I almost forgot.

351
00:39:33,367 --> 00:39:35,452
I want new ones.

352
00:39:35,911 --> 00:39:37,663
What do you want them to say?

353
00:39:39,247 --> 00:39:40,957
Wolverine.

354
00:39:58,433 --> 00:40:01,144
Generals!
Welcome.

355
00:40:01,853 --> 00:40:03,188
General Munson.

356
00:40:04,231 --> 00:40:07,401
Today, we're gonna
witness medical history.

357
00:40:07,609 --> 00:40:10,904
- Today, we're gonna create Weapon X.
- X?

358
00:40:11,488 --> 00:40:14,157
Roman numeral, Ten.

359
00:40:15,534 --> 00:40:20,622
We are about to begin bonding
Adamantium to Weapon X's skeleton.

360
00:40:20,956 --> 00:40:22,666
Let's begin.

361
00:41:09,463 --> 00:41:11,256
<i>- We're brothers, Jimmy.
- Logan!</i>

362
00:41:11,590 --> 00:41:13,800
Body temperature is 1-0-8
and rising.

363
00:41:16,928 --> 00:41:19,556
Why is he thrashing like that?
Why isn't he sedated?

364
00:41:19,556 --> 00:41:21,266
He feels pain,
just like the rest of us.

365
00:41:21,476 --> 00:41:23,144
Anaesthesia won't work on him.

366
00:41:23,144 --> 00:41:25,020
That's why he had to volunteer.
- Heart rate 190.

367
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:27,105
195.

368
00:41:27,314 --> 00:41:29,024
- Will he survive this?
- I don't know.

369
00:41:29,024 --> 00:41:30,734
200.

370
00:41:32,944 --> 00:41:34,237
<i>...son.</i>

371
00:41:35,572 --> 00:41:37,282
Heartbeat's well
beyond maximum.

372
00:41:37,282 --> 00:41:39,701
- Blood pressure?
- 260 over 180 and rising.

373
00:41:39,701 --> 00:41:42,245
He can make it,
he can make it.

374
00:41:46,708 --> 00:41:48,293
<i>Victor!</i>

375
00:41:54,007 --> 00:41:55,425
<i>I love you.</i>

376
00:41:55,425 --> 00:41:57,594
<i>You're not an animal, Logan.</i>

377
00:42:03,308 --> 00:42:05,185
<i>It means...
the Wolverine.</i>

378
00:42:31,878 --> 00:42:34,089
Well, I guess he can die.

379
00:43:04,995 --> 00:43:07,873
Come on, old friend.
Come back.

380
00:43:11,293 --> 00:43:12,294
Heart rate rising.

381
00:43:14,004 --> 00:43:16,256
Adamantium reservoir is depleted.

382
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:19,885
No rejection.
Procedure completed.

383
00:43:19,885 --> 00:43:21,303
We did it!

384
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:22,600
We did it.

385
00:43:29,102 --> 00:43:31,188
We take him to the island?

386
00:43:31,521 --> 00:43:34,232
The island?
No.

387
00:43:35,025 --> 00:43:36,652
The bonding works.

388
00:43:37,070 --> 00:43:39,989
We use his DNA for the XI.

389
00:43:42,074 --> 00:43:44,326
Erase his memory.

390
00:43:47,412 --> 00:43:49,414
<i>Erase his memory.</i>

391
00:43:58,674 --> 00:44:00,467
I think he heard you.

392
00:44:16,149 --> 00:44:17,859
Lockdown!

393
00:44:54,479 --> 00:44:57,983
Hunt him down.
Take his head off.

394
00:45:39,316 --> 00:45:40,901
Travis!

395
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:52,287
I think there is a
naked man in the barn.

396
00:45:52,287 --> 00:45:53,205
Yep.

397
00:46:25,529 --> 00:46:27,447
Son...

398
00:46:27,906 --> 00:46:29,491
What in hell are you doing?

399
00:46:29,908 --> 00:46:33,203
- It's cold.
- Cold?

400
00:46:36,561 --> 00:46:41,378
- You got no clothes on.
- Yeah.

401
00:46:41,670 --> 00:46:43,422
You're not onto
drugs, are you?

402
00:46:43,735 --> 00:46:44,674
No.

403
00:46:46,008 --> 00:46:47,405
You just had a rough night.

404
00:46:47,614 --> 00:46:49,700
Yeah, you could say that.

405
00:46:52,806 --> 00:46:54,516
Come on up the house.

406
00:46:54,975 --> 00:46:58,061
Some of my son's old clothes
will probably fit you.

407
00:46:58,937 --> 00:47:01,398
Here, cover it up with that.

408
00:47:01,773 --> 00:47:04,776
I don't want to give an old lady
a heart attack.

409
00:47:50,781 --> 00:47:51,990
You're alright in there?

410
00:47:51,990 --> 00:47:53,533
Yeah, I'm fine.

411
00:47:55,035 --> 00:47:56,328
Supper's on the table.

412
00:47:56,746 --> 00:47:59,144
I... Yeah, I'll be there in a minute.

413
00:48:10,592 --> 00:48:12,844
I swear I'm gonna pay for it.

414
00:48:14,262 --> 00:48:16,473
Set it down over there.

415
00:48:21,561 --> 00:48:23,271
Come and sit down, son.

416
00:48:29,194 --> 00:48:32,114
I can't thank you both
enough... for everything.

417
00:48:32,114 --> 00:48:34,992
It wouldn't have been decent
to leave you out there to freeze.

418
00:48:35,450 --> 00:48:38,370
- Decent...
- What?

419
00:48:38,704 --> 00:48:42,499
Um... Nothing, I'm just not
really used to that word.

420
00:48:45,252 --> 00:48:46,628
That's a nice chopper
you've got out there.

421
00:48:46,838 --> 00:48:48,193
You know motorcycle?

422
00:48:48,193 --> 00:48:50,007
Oh Lord, here we go!

423
00:48:50,007 --> 00:48:51,383
My favorite is a '48 Panhead.

424
00:48:51,383 --> 00:48:52,676
I bought one new off the line.

425
00:48:52,676 --> 00:48:55,429
I think you're a little young
for that, son.

426
00:48:55,429 --> 00:48:58,640
You must be exhausted.
You get a good night's sleep.

427
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:00,559
In the barn.

428
00:49:01,309 --> 00:49:03,645
Nothing you can
break out there.

429
00:49:19,494 --> 00:49:22,414
<i>- Why is the moon so lonely?
- Why?</i>

430
00:49:23,999 --> 00:49:26,585
<i>Because she
used to have a lover.</i>

431
00:49:28,587 --> 00:49:31,298
<i>He can never touch her again.</i>

432
00:49:50,609 --> 00:49:51,443
You sleep ok?

433
00:49:53,570 --> 00:49:55,072
Uh...yeah.

434
00:49:57,282 --> 00:50:01,453
You look like a man fixing
to do a bad thing.

435
00:50:03,080 --> 00:50:06,667
You know what happens
to many looking for blood?

436
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:10,837
- What?
- They find it.

437
00:50:13,340 --> 00:50:17,177
- We all got a choice, son.
- Yeah, mine got taken.

438
00:50:17,177 --> 00:50:19,179
Bullshit.

439
00:50:22,933 --> 00:50:25,227
This was my son's jacket.

440
00:50:27,187 --> 00:50:28,772
Try it on.

441
00:50:44,413 --> 00:50:48,250
- Thank you.
- Yep...

442
00:50:49,001 --> 00:50:53,714
You wanna take my bike for a spin,
test the suspension.

443
00:50:54,756 --> 00:50:57,092
'64, huh?

444
00:50:59,219 --> 00:51:00,387
Man, you're heavy.

445
00:51:00,596 --> 00:51:03,099
Yeah, I put on a little
weight recently.

446
00:51:03,099 --> 00:51:04,016
Good morning.

447
00:51:04,307 --> 00:51:05,142
Good morning.

448
00:51:08,562 --> 00:51:10,814
Oh, it fits you beautifully!

449
00:51:12,524 --> 00:51:13,692
I brought you some...

450
00:51:22,743 --> 00:51:25,454
<i>Weapon X is in the barn.
He just murdered two civilians.</i>

451
00:51:25,454 --> 00:51:28,790
Blow him to bits.
Let's see if he can survive that.

452
00:51:53,776 --> 00:51:55,027
Come and get me!

453
00:52:07,875 --> 00:52:09,293
Blow his brains all over the road.

454
00:52:09,710 --> 00:52:10,962
Damn!

455
00:52:47,165 --> 00:52:49,083
Alpha One, do not lose him!

456
00:52:57,383 --> 00:52:59,594
<i>Alpha 2, target's
coming to you!</i>

457
00:53:51,083 --> 00:53:52,918
Pull up!

458
00:54:44,200 --> 00:54:45,200
<i>Zero?</i>

459
00:54:48,650 --> 00:54:49,700
<i>Zero, come in!</i>

460
00:54:53,300 --> 00:54:54,400
<i>Zero!</i>

461
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:01,800
<i>Zero, is Logan dead?</i>

462
00:55:02,300 --> 00:55:03,500
I don't know, I'm down.

463
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:08,800
<i>Zero, is Logan dead?</i>

464
00:55:13,690 --> 00:55:15,484
<i>Zero, come in!</i>

465
00:55:19,858 --> 00:55:21,651
<i>You tried to kill me.</i>

466
00:55:22,110 --> 00:55:23,153
Logan?

467
00:55:23,153 --> 00:55:24,446
Where is Victor?

468
00:55:24,446 --> 00:55:26,260
Come back to base.

469
00:55:26,489 --> 00:55:28,491
I'll explain everything, we'll
take Victor down together.

470
00:55:28,491 --> 00:55:30,118
<i>Wrong answer.</i>

471
00:55:30,118 --> 00:55:32,871
After I've killed Victor,
I'm coming for you.

472
00:55:35,624 --> 00:55:37,626
<i>Logan, listen to me.</i>

473
00:55:37,626 --> 00:55:40,212
If you go down this road, you're
not gonna like what you find.

474
00:55:41,379 --> 00:55:43,715
You wanted the
animal, Colonel?

475
00:55:44,237 --> 00:55:45,593
You got it.

476
00:55:50,013 --> 00:55:52,682
Those were good
people back there.

477
00:55:52,933 --> 00:55:55,018
Innocent people.

478
00:56:03,881 --> 00:56:06,926
It's funny how good innocent
people tend to die around you.

479
00:56:29,010 --> 00:56:31,471
Zero never stood a chance.

480
00:56:31,471 --> 00:56:35,308
The only thing that'll take him
down is an Adamantium bullet

481
00:56:42,857 --> 00:56:45,610
This facility is compromised.
Prep transport.

482
00:56:54,786 --> 00:56:56,538
Colonel, this is turning
into a disaster.

483
00:56:57,038 --> 00:56:59,249
- Don't worry, we'll stop him.
- Really?

484
00:56:59,249 --> 00:57:00,813
You've just spent
half a billion dollars...

485
00:57:01,023 --> 00:57:02,587
making him indestructible.

486
00:57:05,589 --> 00:57:06,652
- Sir?
- Yes.

487
00:57:06,986 --> 00:57:10,343
The young mutant you've
been looking for, we found him.

488
00:57:10,844 --> 00:57:12,846
General, Logan isn't the
only piece in this puzzle.

489
00:57:13,242 --> 00:57:14,910
I need to evacuate this facility.

490
00:57:15,120 --> 00:57:17,518
Please, go back to Washington.

491
00:57:17,726 --> 00:57:19,060
We've got work to do.

492
00:57:22,209 --> 00:57:25,880
Yo hablo: I talk, tu hablas:
you talk, el habla?

493
00:57:25,880 --> 00:57:27,465
Somebody translate?

494
00:57:28,507 --> 00:57:29,550
Summers?

495
00:57:29,842 --> 00:57:32,470
Sit up and take
off those glasses.

496
00:57:33,637 --> 00:57:35,890
I have a headache.

497
00:57:36,223 --> 00:57:38,642
Then you can wear them
in detention after school

498
00:57:38,642 --> 00:57:41,353
while you add up
this conjugation 100 times.

499
00:57:41,979 --> 00:57:42,855
Somebody else?

500
00:57:42,855 --> 00:57:43,898
<i>He talks.</i>

501
00:57:43,898 --> 00:57:46,067
Thank you, he talks.
El habla.

502
00:57:57,536 --> 00:57:59,830
- You sure it was Victor?
- Yeah.

503
00:58:00,790 --> 00:58:02,040
Damn!

504
00:58:03,167 --> 00:58:05,169
I'm sorry, mate.

505
00:58:07,505 --> 00:58:09,882
What the hell happened
to him after I left?

506
00:58:09,882 --> 00:58:10,800
He got worse.

507
00:58:11,217 --> 00:58:13,135
He felt like you
abandoned him.

508
00:58:13,135 --> 00:58:15,054
Hell, we all do.

509
00:58:15,054 --> 00:58:18,891
But Victor, he had to prove
you he was better than you.

510
00:58:18,891 --> 00:58:21,727
Hunting and killing everything's
he was pointin' at.

511
00:58:22,019 --> 00:58:26,107
Quit a few months later myself,
couldn't take rounding them up.

512
00:58:27,108 --> 00:58:29,902
- Rounding who up?
- Leave it alone.

513
00:58:29,902 --> 00:58:31,946
Rounding who up, John?

514
00:58:32,530 --> 00:58:34,532
Hey! God damn it, John!

515
00:58:34,532 --> 00:58:36,951
We hunted our
own kind, Logan.

516
00:58:37,159 --> 00:58:39,703
There's a special place in hell
for the things we did.

517
00:58:39,703 --> 00:58:40,621
Mutants?

518
00:58:42,123 --> 00:58:43,457
Why?

519
00:58:43,666 --> 00:58:46,252
Stryker'd say we would
be making a difference.

520
00:58:46,585 --> 00:58:49,296
Protecting people
from the bad ones.

521
00:58:57,179 --> 00:58:59,682
How are you gonna take
Victor down, Logan?

522
00:59:00,307 --> 00:59:01,726
Remember that stuff in Africa?

523
00:59:01,935 --> 00:59:03,812
Yeah, I remember Africa,
what about it?

524
00:59:08,065 --> 00:59:09,316
Damn!

525
00:59:10,776 --> 00:59:12,319
What'd they do to you?

526
00:59:12,945 --> 00:59:14,363
Don't ask.

527
00:59:16,949 --> 00:59:18,409
Listen, Zero said
something about an island.

528
00:59:18,618 --> 00:59:20,287
Does that mean
anything to you?

529
00:59:20,287 --> 00:59:21,370
Nope.

530
00:59:21,370 --> 00:59:22,997
But maybe Dukes knows.

531
00:59:22,997 --> 00:59:25,124
- Him and Zero were real tight.
- Fred Dukes?

532
00:59:25,124 --> 00:59:26,459
- Where is he?
- He's here.

533
00:59:26,459 --> 00:59:28,461
- Well, let's go talk to him.
- Hold on.

534
00:59:28,461 --> 00:59:30,379
He don't get in
until around four.

535
00:59:30,379 --> 00:59:31,547
But I gotta warn you...

536
00:59:31,757 --> 00:59:33,633
he developed a bit
of eating disorder.

537
00:59:33,633 --> 00:59:35,301
We all got our
coping mechanisms.

538
00:59:35,510 --> 00:59:37,387
I'm trying to whoop
him back into shape.

539
00:59:38,700 --> 00:59:40,000
Whatever you do, don't mention his weight.

540
00:59:41,807 --> 00:59:44,143
Come on, Fred, if you want to get
into shape, you gotta move, man.

541
00:59:44,143 --> 00:59:45,352
I told him he got to move.

542
00:59:50,608 --> 00:59:53,152
Fred Dukes? Trapped inside
that creature? That ain't Fred Dukes.

543
00:59:53,152 --> 00:59:55,404
Hey, be nice.

544
00:59:56,864 --> 00:59:59,075
Hey, Fat, Fred, um.

545
00:59:59,742 --> 01:00:02,620
See, I remember that girl
when she's got 85 pounds, huh.

546
01:00:04,789 --> 01:00:07,729
Oh that's funny.
You're still so funny, Logan.

547
01:00:07,729 --> 01:00:10,461
You know where Victor is?

548
01:00:10,461 --> 01:00:11,504
No idea.

549
01:00:11,504 --> 01:00:13,756
What's the island, slim?

550
01:00:15,674 --> 01:00:17,927
Don't let the door hit you
on the way out, Logan.

551
01:00:18,260 --> 01:00:20,179
Listen, I ain't gonna leave
until you tell me where Victor is.

552
01:00:20,179 --> 01:00:22,390
Come on, Bob.
For old times' sake, huh?

553
01:00:24,600 --> 01:00:25,935
Did you just call me...

554
01:00:27,291 --> 01:00:28,855
Blob?

555
01:00:29,855 --> 01:00:31,690
No, but...

556
01:00:37,488 --> 01:00:38,593
I told you not to
mention his weight.

557
01:00:38,803 --> 01:00:40,158
Why did you call him Blob?

558
01:00:40,366 --> 01:00:42,743
I didn't call him Blob,
I said Bob!

559
01:00:42,743 --> 01:00:44,537
Goddamn it!

560
01:00:44,995 --> 01:00:46,372
I got an idea.

561
01:00:48,040 --> 01:00:50,418
- This is your idea of an idea?
- Trying to help you out, Logan.

562
01:00:50,418 --> 01:00:52,378
Dukes don't like you that much,
and you know it.

563
01:00:52,378 --> 01:00:53,629
The feeling is mutual.

564
01:00:53,629 --> 01:00:56,132
Use those gloves, man,
dance with him a little bit.

565
01:00:56,132 --> 01:00:58,342
Allow him to let his
anger out on you.

566
01:00:58,884 --> 01:00:59,739
I figure if you do that...

567
01:00:59,949 --> 01:01:01,722
he might tell you everything
you wanna know.

568
01:01:01,971 --> 01:01:03,723
Come on, man, look at him.

569
01:01:03,723 --> 01:01:06,267
Big old ass comin' out of
the front of his shirt.

570
01:01:06,559 --> 01:01:08,832
Jesus, he's gonna have a
coronary for Christ's sake.

571
01:01:09,061 --> 01:01:10,083
Is there even a
stretcher big enough...

572
01:01:10,293 --> 01:01:11,857
to take this guy out of here?

573
01:01:13,691 --> 01:01:15,860
It ain't him I'm worried about
getting out on a stretcher.

574
01:01:16,068 --> 01:01:17,361
- You're an asshole.
- Come on, Logan.

575
01:01:20,614 --> 01:01:21,490
Whoop his ass!

576
01:01:21,490 --> 01:01:23,701
- If you want.
- Dance with him Fred.

577
01:01:24,827 --> 01:01:27,079
What's that suppose to do?
You wanna dance with me?

578
01:01:27,413 --> 01:01:28,956
Oh. Oh, that feels good.

579
01:01:32,918 --> 01:01:34,795
Hey, guess what?

580
01:01:35,921 --> 01:01:37,068
See, he's gonna talk, man.

581
01:01:37,278 --> 01:01:38,425
You got him right
where you want him.

582
01:01:38,425 --> 01:01:40,051
Whose side are
you on anyway?

583
01:01:41,900 --> 01:01:43,000
Come on now, lambchop.

584
01:02:15,294 --> 01:02:17,296
Now, where is Victor?

585
01:02:48,077 --> 01:02:50,830
A little dark for sunglasses,
don't you think?

586
01:03:06,595 --> 01:03:09,432
Please don't! Please!
Don't, please!

587
01:03:09,432 --> 01:03:11,142
Victor!

588
01:03:15,771 --> 01:03:17,440
Hey! Where's Victor?

589
01:03:19,942 --> 01:03:23,446
Victor's... with Stryker
on... on the island...

590
01:03:23,655 --> 01:03:26,158
they... they run it together.

591
01:03:28,492 --> 01:03:29,285
What... what?

592
01:03:29,285 --> 01:03:31,328
Victor's been with Stryker?

593
01:03:31,328 --> 01:03:32,830
Yeah.

594
01:03:33,164 --> 01:03:34,582
You didn't know that?

595
01:03:55,352 --> 01:03:57,396
All that's left
now is Logan, I...

596
01:03:57,396 --> 01:04:00,566
...trust you can handle that.

597
01:04:01,025 --> 01:04:02,943
I did before, didn't I?

598
01:04:02,943 --> 01:04:05,362
Oh yes, you did that.

599
01:04:07,907 --> 01:04:12,328
Our deal... it still applies, right?

600
01:04:13,662 --> 01:04:14,789
Of course.

601
01:04:14,789 --> 01:04:17,500
Now pack him
and tag him, Captain.

602
01:04:25,674 --> 01:04:27,718
What's the island?

603
01:04:27,718 --> 01:04:32,848
It's where... Striker takes
them after Victor's caught 'em.

604
01:04:33,307 --> 01:04:36,268
Wait, wait... um, what?
Takes who?

605
01:04:37,353 --> 01:04:39,230
Mutants.

606
01:04:39,605 --> 01:04:44,360
The rumor is that Stryker's doing
experiments on them there.

607
01:04:46,612 --> 01:04:48,989
Well, you never wondered
what happened to them?

608
01:04:48,989 --> 01:04:51,367
I tried not to.

609
01:05:07,174 --> 01:05:07,758
They killed her...

610
01:05:07,968 --> 01:05:11,930
so I'd let them put
Adamantium in me.

611
01:05:13,848 --> 01:05:16,559
They killed her for a
goddamn experiment.

612
01:05:20,813 --> 01:05:22,648
Where is it?

613
01:05:22,648 --> 01:05:25,568
Logan, Stryker kept it real secret.

614
01:05:29,530 --> 01:05:30,250
But...

615
01:05:32,366 --> 01:05:34,869
- A prisoner escaped there once.
- Who?

616
01:05:34,869 --> 01:05:35,911
His name is Remy LeBeau.

617
01:05:35,911 --> 01:05:38,289
He was a street hustler
from New Orleans.

618
01:05:38,581 --> 01:05:41,542
The guards at the prison
called him Gambit

619
01:05:41,542 --> 01:05:42,939
because he kept taking
all their money at poker...

620
01:05:43,149 --> 01:05:43,879
that's all I know.

621
01:05:43,879 --> 01:05:46,464
What's Stryker up to Fred,
what's the end game?

622
01:05:48,966 --> 01:05:53,095
He's taking their powers,
trying to combine them somehow.

623
01:05:53,471 --> 01:05:55,848
It's all I know, Logan.
It's all I know.

624
01:05:57,183 --> 01:06:00,269
If I had to come back here,
I'm gonna take your head off.

625
01:06:04,523 --> 01:06:06,067
I'm coming with you, Logan.

626
01:06:08,069 --> 01:06:10,613
- There's no redemption where I'm going.
- I ain't asking.

627
01:06:48,442 --> 01:06:50,069
There's our dude.

628
01:06:56,659 --> 01:06:58,285
That's cool.

629
01:06:58,744 --> 01:07:00,955
But I'm going to go
and cover the back if he runs.

630
01:07:00,955 --> 01:07:02,289
I'm not havin'
a fight with him.

631
01:07:02,289 --> 01:07:03,916
- Yeah right.
- What?

632
01:07:03,916 --> 01:07:05,334
I am havin' fights
with everybody?

633
01:07:05,334 --> 01:07:07,420
Don't dogs kill cats?

634
01:07:07,420 --> 01:07:09,505
Just go cover the back, will ya?

635
01:07:21,934 --> 01:07:24,770
Are you Remy LeBeau?

636
01:07:26,021 --> 01:07:27,648
Do I owe you money?

637
01:07:27,857 --> 01:07:29,108
No.

638
01:07:30,151 --> 01:07:32,236
Then Remy LeBeau I am.

639
01:07:50,588 --> 01:07:53,549
Large blind is 100,
and the small blind's 50.

640
01:07:54,425 --> 01:07:56,302
May I deal you in?

641
01:07:56,302 --> 01:07:58,596
Now what can I
get for 17 bucks?

642
01:07:59,555 --> 01:08:01,515
17 dollars?

643
01:08:02,224 --> 01:08:04,268
A cab ride home, perhaps.

644
01:08:08,856 --> 01:08:11,233
You're my brother's
new babysitter, John?

645
01:08:12,485 --> 01:08:14,236
I ain't Bradley, Victor.

646
01:08:14,236 --> 01:08:16,113
And your creepy black
coat don't scare me.

647
01:08:16,113 --> 01:08:17,656
Really?

648
01:08:17,928 --> 01:08:19,137
It worked on Dukes.

649
01:08:19,971 --> 01:08:21,911
Shouldn't had done that, 'cause
now I'm gonna kill you...

650
01:08:22,120 --> 01:08:23,580
before Logan gets the chance.

651
01:08:24,622 --> 01:08:27,374
So what brings you
to our fair city, sir?

652
01:08:27,374 --> 01:08:29,460
Victor Creed.

653
01:08:31,629 --> 01:08:32,838
And who's that?

654
01:08:33,672 --> 01:08:35,841
The man I'm gonna kill.

655
01:08:37,218 --> 01:08:40,513
He works for a man named
Stryker on, uh, on an island.

656
01:08:41,430 --> 01:08:44,850
- I just need to know where it is.
- Why would you think I know that?

657
01:08:45,142 --> 01:08:47,478
Well, 'cause I know
who you are, Gambit.

658
01:08:48,979 --> 01:08:50,418
You are the guy who escaped...

659
01:08:50,628 --> 01:08:53,235
and you are the guy who's
gonna take me back there.

660
01:08:55,111 --> 01:08:56,862
You know, John...

661
01:08:56,862 --> 01:08:58,989
There's something I always
wanted to tell you.

662
01:09:04,453 --> 01:09:06,914
You're predictable.

663
01:09:10,709 --> 01:09:13,254
I can feel your spine, Johnny Boy.

664
01:09:14,004 --> 01:09:17,133
That's funny.
I never knew you had one.

665
01:09:20,344 --> 01:09:24,140
Those are mighty nice tags
you have on there, sir.

666
01:09:25,182 --> 01:09:28,352
The men who took me
wore tags just like 'em.

667
01:09:31,856 --> 01:09:33,899
Hey, now Bob, you listen to me...

668
01:10:07,391 --> 01:10:08,914
Two years I was
rottin' in that hell...

669
01:10:09,123 --> 01:10:11,313
and I'm never going back.

670
01:10:14,065 --> 01:10:16,650
Oh, shiny.

671
01:10:18,819 --> 01:10:20,821
Tell me something, Jimmy.

672
01:10:21,614 --> 01:10:23,824
Do you even know
how to kill me?

673
01:10:23,824 --> 01:10:26,494
I'm gonna cut your
goddamn head off.

674
01:10:27,369 --> 01:10:29,330
See if that works.

675
01:10:39,006 --> 01:10:40,674
You're gettin' slow, old man.

676
01:10:50,101 --> 01:10:52,436
Son of a bitch.

677
01:10:55,981 --> 01:10:58,567
You're gonna die for
what you did to her.

678
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:24,218
Victor!

679
01:11:33,853 --> 01:11:35,896
That's a nice stick.

680
01:12:34,955 --> 01:12:36,916
Shithead.
Here's the deal.

681
01:12:37,124 --> 01:12:39,376
See, you're gonna take me to this
island, where I can kill Creed,

682
01:12:39,376 --> 01:12:42,213
Stryker, pretty much everyone
you hate in this world.

683
01:12:42,463 --> 01:12:44,131
Do you understand?

684
01:12:45,508 --> 01:12:46,884
You really gonna kill 'em.

685
01:12:46,884 --> 01:12:49,345
As long as you stay
out of my way, yeah.

686
01:13:03,567 --> 01:13:04,735
Colonel.

687
01:13:05,861 --> 01:13:06,946
General?

688
01:13:06,946 --> 01:13:09,448
Is this Weapon XI?

689
01:13:10,699 --> 01:13:13,828
All their strenghts but
none of their weaknesses.

690
01:13:13,828 --> 01:13:15,955
You really hate them, don't you?

691
01:13:16,288 --> 01:13:17,811
No, I don't hate them.

692
01:13:18,249 --> 01:13:19,688
After 20 years of
working with them...

693
01:13:19,897 --> 01:13:21,670
I just know what they can do.

694
01:13:26,340 --> 01:13:27,633
If we win this war
before it starts...

695
01:13:27,843 --> 01:13:30,345
it'll save countless
lives in the process.

696
01:13:30,345 --> 01:13:33,556
Preemptive action is
the only action here, General.

697
01:13:34,098 --> 01:13:38,227
The days of our country sitting
on the sidelines are over.

698
01:13:38,853 --> 01:13:40,521
We need to take the
fight to the enemy...

699
01:13:40,731 --> 01:13:42,399
before they take
the fight to us.

700
01:13:42,982 --> 01:13:45,860
- I admire your passion, I do.
- Thank you.

701
01:13:46,652 --> 01:13:49,447
But this is as far as it goes.

702
01:13:49,780 --> 01:13:51,991
Weapon X was a... a hickup.

703
01:13:51,991 --> 01:13:53,826
We know about your son, Bill.

704
01:13:53,826 --> 01:13:55,661
We know he's a mutant.

705
01:13:55,661 --> 01:13:57,204
And we know
he killed your wife.

706
01:13:57,414 --> 01:13:58,874
You shouldn't have
kept that from us.

707
01:13:58,874 --> 01:14:00,458
That...

708
01:14:02,168 --> 01:14:04,086
That has nothing
to do with my work.

709
01:14:04,296 --> 01:14:05,130
Bullshit.

710
01:14:05,421 --> 01:14:08,841
You're too close to this.
I'm sure you know it.

711
01:14:11,218 --> 01:14:14,680
You're right.
I...I won't lie to you.

712
01:14:17,641 --> 01:14:22,646
My son did bring the
problem home for me.

713
01:14:23,063 --> 01:14:25,649
But I took an oath...

714
01:14:26,066 --> 01:14:29,195
to protect the American people

715
01:14:29,487 --> 01:14:31,655
from every threat,

716
01:14:31,864 --> 01:14:33,616
both foreign

717
01:14:40,664 --> 01:14:42,291
...and domestic.

718
01:14:50,174 --> 01:14:52,176
- You don't like flying, huh?
- I'm fine.

719
01:14:52,176 --> 01:14:53,511
Just concentrate on
what you're doing.

720
01:14:53,511 --> 01:14:55,346
You sure? You got a bit of
sweat on your brow there.

721
01:14:55,346 --> 01:14:57,056
Very funny, just keep
your eyes on the...

722
01:14:57,265 --> 01:14:58,517
On the what? Clouds?

723
01:14:58,808 --> 01:15:01,143
We're jumpin' up and down
like a freakin' yoyo here.

724
01:15:01,143 --> 01:15:02,291
Where did you get
this thing anyway?

725
01:15:02,291 --> 01:15:04,605
Oh, this is my baby,
I won her in a game.

726
01:15:04,605 --> 01:15:07,733
- Jacks over fives.
- Great.

727
01:15:08,943 --> 01:15:11,404
Relax. We're almost there.

728
01:15:14,500 --> 01:15:16,200
There it is. The island.

729
01:15:16,450 --> 01:15:19,954
Three Mile Island.
Hiding in plain sight.

730
01:15:22,998 --> 01:15:25,584
No one's gonna snoop
around a nuclear reactor.

731
01:15:25,584 --> 01:15:28,129
They think it's gonna
turn them into freaks.

732
01:15:28,129 --> 01:15:29,380
Like you?

733
01:15:29,380 --> 01:15:31,132
Right.

734
01:15:32,591 --> 01:15:34,343
All right, you ready?

735
01:15:34,343 --> 01:15:35,970
Because it's now or never.
Let's go.

736
01:15:35,970 --> 01:15:37,346
About time.

737
01:15:46,564 --> 01:15:48,190
Hey, if it's make you
feel any better...

738
01:15:48,400 --> 01:15:49,651
this is really gonna hurt.

739
01:15:49,651 --> 01:15:53,320
Well yeah, it kind
of does actually.

740
01:15:53,946 --> 01:15:55,322
Good luck.

741
01:15:55,823 --> 01:15:57,450
Likewise.

742
01:15:59,243 --> 01:16:00,745
Oh shit.

743
01:16:07,668 --> 01:16:08,836
How are you doing?

744
01:16:09,378 --> 01:16:10,838
Is everything alright?

745
01:16:11,881 --> 01:16:14,300
- Is he ready yet?
- A few more hours.

746
01:16:14,633 --> 01:16:16,719
And he will respond
to my commands?

747
01:16:16,719 --> 01:16:18,721
Absolutely!

748
01:17:21,242 --> 01:17:22,410
Logan.

749
01:17:23,744 --> 01:17:25,538
Welcome back to the war.

750
01:17:26,914 --> 01:17:30,251
Before I gut you,
I wanna know why.

751
01:17:31,460 --> 01:17:33,796
I needed your powers
for the pool.

752
01:17:33,796 --> 01:17:35,548
For the what?

753
01:17:35,548 --> 01:17:38,843
A mutant killer.
The dead pool.

754
01:17:39,677 --> 01:17:41,971
Years of searching,
to find...

755
01:17:42,180 --> 01:17:43,432
finding the right powers...

756
01:17:43,432 --> 01:17:48,227
that can coexist in one body
without ripping it apart.

757
01:17:49,478 --> 01:17:53,190
My son was the first
piece of the puzzle.

758
01:17:53,983 --> 01:17:55,985
Logan, you were the last.

759
01:17:56,402 --> 01:17:58,154
You made Weapon XI possible.

760
01:17:59,655 --> 01:18:00,489
I...

761
01:18:00,990 --> 01:18:02,262
I asked you to help but...

762
01:18:02,680 --> 01:18:06,747
you said you wanted
the quiet life.

763
01:18:07,037 --> 01:18:07,830
Well...

764
01:18:08,914 --> 01:18:10,979
I've learned that
nothing motivates...

765
01:18:11,188 --> 01:18:14,734
the men in your
family like revenge.

766
01:18:31,312 --> 01:18:33,063
Who are you?

767
01:18:33,814 --> 01:18:36,400
Oh she's a real old friend.

768
01:18:47,995 --> 01:18:50,081
Do you really think we'd
just let you walk away?

769
01:18:51,290 --> 01:18:53,793
You are a dangerous man.

770
01:18:54,001 --> 01:18:56,670
I like to keep an eye
on dangerous men.

771
01:18:56,921 --> 01:18:59,090
Tell him about the
day you died.

772
01:19:05,137 --> 01:19:08,390
They gave me a shot of
hydrochloride thiazide.

773
01:19:10,476 --> 01:19:12,540
<i>It reduces the heart rate so low...</i>

774
01:19:12,750 --> 01:19:14,314
<i>it appears you flatline.</i>

775
01:19:26,033 --> 01:19:28,577
Don't be angry with her.

776
01:19:29,078 --> 01:19:32,456
Real credit... to your species.

777
01:19:35,126 --> 01:19:36,710
Did you know that her sister...

778
01:19:36,920 --> 01:19:39,214
has diamond-hard skin?

779
01:19:39,214 --> 01:19:42,800
Kayla's mutation
is tacto-hypnosis.

780
01:19:42,800 --> 01:19:45,845
She can influence people as
long as she touches them.

781
01:19:45,845 --> 01:19:48,639
Quite a useful tool
in the seduction.

782
01:19:48,848 --> 01:19:51,475
It was never real, my friend.

783
01:19:56,230 --> 01:19:58,441
It was real for me.

784
01:20:00,234 --> 01:20:01,756
I told you if you
came down this road...

785
01:20:01,966 --> 01:20:03,530
you wouldn't like
what you'd found.

786
01:20:10,953 --> 01:20:13,038
That story you told me...

787
01:20:13,038 --> 01:20:16,542
about man who gets
flowers for the moon...

788
01:20:17,710 --> 01:20:20,629
I had it backwards.

789
01:20:22,673 --> 01:20:26,218
I thought you were the moon
and I was your Wolverine.

790
01:20:28,471 --> 01:20:31,640
But you were the
Trickster, aren't you?

791
01:20:31,849 --> 01:20:34,393
I am just the fool that got played.

792
01:20:36,353 --> 01:20:39,899
The worst part of this is
I should have known.

793
01:20:42,443 --> 01:20:45,070
But I ignored my instincts.

794
01:20:47,990 --> 01:20:50,993
I ignored what I really am.

795
01:20:55,247 --> 01:20:58,167
Well, that will never happen again.

796
01:21:29,156 --> 01:21:31,283
- Colonel.
- Not now, Kayla.

797
01:21:31,283 --> 01:21:34,120
I have done everything
you've asked.

798
01:21:35,287 --> 01:21:37,289
My sister...

799
01:21:37,832 --> 01:21:40,167
You said that if I help you,
you'd let her go.

800
01:21:40,793 --> 01:21:42,711
Kayla, it's not
as simple as that.

801
01:21:42,711 --> 01:21:45,673
Her mutation is unique.
Quite beautiful.

802
01:21:45,673 --> 01:21:47,925
We just need a little more
time to analyze it, that's all.

803
01:21:47,925 --> 01:21:49,009
You let him go?

804
01:21:52,847 --> 01:21:55,266
- Victor, please.
- You can't let him go.

805
01:21:55,266 --> 01:21:57,726
- You can't beat him, Victor.
- Give me the Adamantium.

806
01:21:57,726 --> 01:21:58,978
- Tests came out...
- We had a deal!

807
01:21:58,978 --> 01:22:01,272
You would never
survive the operation.

808
01:22:03,732 --> 01:22:05,046
I can take anything he can.

809
01:22:05,256 --> 01:22:06,820
No, you can't.

810
01:22:07,987 --> 01:22:09,363
You are my
favorite soldier, Victor.

811
01:22:09,905 --> 01:22:11,532
Be patient, time will come.

812
01:22:11,866 --> 01:22:12,908
He's using us!

813
01:22:22,001 --> 01:22:26,338
How about this time,
you die for real?

814
01:22:27,047 --> 01:22:28,299
Let me go.

815
01:22:31,135 --> 01:22:33,596
Your little mind game
don't work on me.

816
01:22:34,013 --> 01:22:35,222
Victor!

817
01:23:09,465 --> 01:23:11,467
Feels good, doesn't it?

818
01:23:12,676 --> 01:23:14,845
All that rage...

819
01:23:16,055 --> 01:23:17,640
Do it.

820
01:23:17,640 --> 01:23:19,266
Logan!

821
01:23:20,351 --> 01:23:21,477
You're not an animal.

822
01:23:22,520 --> 01:23:24,480
Oh yes, you are.

823
01:23:27,983 --> 01:23:29,193
Do it.

824
01:23:33,197 --> 01:23:35,366
Finish it.

825
01:23:59,432 --> 01:24:00,224
Logan?

826
01:24:04,019 --> 01:24:05,729
My sister.

827
01:24:05,938 --> 01:24:07,356
They have my sister.

828
01:24:08,524 --> 01:24:11,110
Please, I didn't trick you
into loving me.

829
01:24:11,902 --> 01:24:13,404
It was real for me too.

830
01:24:16,782 --> 01:24:18,742
Please, I'm so sorry.

831
01:24:18,742 --> 01:24:21,328
They have my sister.

832
01:24:21,787 --> 01:24:23,372
Where is she?

833
01:24:28,586 --> 01:24:30,171
Activate Weapon XI.

834
01:24:30,380 --> 01:24:31,423
The bonding process
is incomplete.

835
01:24:31,423 --> 01:24:32,527
Just do it!

836
01:24:32,527 --> 01:24:33,632
Now!

837
01:25:35,319 --> 01:25:37,029
Are you okay?
Come on.

838
01:26:28,893 --> 01:26:30,186
Okay...

839
01:26:31,700 --> 01:26:32,993
Perfect.

840
01:26:33,285 --> 01:26:34,787
- Kayla, get these kids out of here.
- Logan...

841
01:26:34,787 --> 01:26:37,206
Find another way out.

842
01:26:37,206 --> 01:26:39,208
Come on, let's go!

843
01:26:40,209 --> 01:26:42,211
Wade, is that you?

844
01:26:45,881 --> 01:26:49,093
I guess Stryker finally figured
out how to shut you up.

845
01:26:59,854 --> 01:27:00,646
Wade...

846
01:27:02,148 --> 01:27:03,691
You don't have to do this.

847
01:27:05,109 --> 01:27:06,360
Alright, maybe you do.

848
01:27:21,417 --> 01:27:22,293
Shoot on sight!

849
01:27:30,801 --> 01:27:32,386
I can help! Point me at 'em!

850
01:27:32,720 --> 01:27:33,637
Go!

851
01:27:42,188 --> 01:27:43,314
Go! Now!

852
01:27:50,112 --> 01:27:51,655
Did I get them?

853
01:27:51,655 --> 01:27:52,865
Yeah.

854
01:28:02,750 --> 01:28:03,876
- Let's go.
- I can't go.

855
01:28:03,876 --> 01:28:05,127
Kayla, come on!

856
01:28:05,127 --> 01:28:06,504
I have to stay here.

857
01:28:07,254 --> 01:28:09,173
You take them.

858
01:28:09,569 --> 01:28:10,362
Go!

859
01:28:11,592 --> 01:28:12,384
Go!

860
01:28:40,219 --> 01:28:41,261
<i>Go left.</i>

861
01:28:41,539 --> 01:28:42,331
Left.

862
01:28:43,666 --> 01:28:45,417
- What?
- We go left.

863
01:28:45,417 --> 01:28:47,586
- You can't see.
- Trust me.

864
01:29:01,517 --> 01:29:03,686
C'mon Bob! Let's see
your dance up here.

865
01:29:40,724 --> 01:29:42,392
Nobody kills you but me.

866
01:29:51,610 --> 01:29:52,611
Back-to-back!

867
01:29:55,426 --> 01:29:56,928
- I got him!
- Oh no, you don't.

868
01:31:32,627 --> 01:31:33,420
Stop!

869
01:31:34,045 --> 01:31:35,505
- This can't be the way.
- This is the way!

870
01:31:35,505 --> 01:31:37,257
- How do you know?
- I just know.

871
01:31:37,674 --> 01:31:38,467
Come on.

872
01:31:49,811 --> 01:31:50,896
Adamantium bullets.

873
01:31:52,230 --> 01:31:55,567
Let's see him heal with a few
of these through his thick skull.

874
01:31:55,567 --> 01:31:58,153
You can't stop him.
Even with that.

875
01:31:58,153 --> 01:31:59,488
He'll heal.

876
01:31:59,488 --> 01:32:01,740
His brain may heal.

877
01:32:03,075 --> 01:32:05,827
But his memories
won't grow back.

878
01:32:22,094 --> 01:32:25,138
This doesn't change anything
between us, Victor.

879
01:32:26,598 --> 01:32:27,974
We're done.

880
01:32:27,974 --> 01:32:30,560
We can never
be done, Jimmy.

881
01:32:30,560 --> 01:32:32,562
We're brothers.

882
01:32:32,562 --> 01:32:35,190
Brothers look out for each other.

883
01:33:08,557 --> 01:33:10,392
- You miss me?
- Jesus...

884
01:33:12,519 --> 01:33:14,146
You know, when you said you
were gonna kill everyone...

885
01:33:14,355 --> 01:33:16,858
I thought you may just've
been exaggerating.

886
01:33:17,357 --> 01:33:18,150
Yeah...

887
01:33:19,526 --> 01:33:21,319
Do I look like a man
who exaggerates?

888
01:33:21,862 --> 01:33:22,821
You're welcome.

889
01:33:26,900 --> 01:33:27,900
<i>Logan.</i>

890
01:33:31,580 --> 01:33:32,956
These kids trying
to get off the island.

891
01:33:32,956 --> 01:33:34,499
- Split up. Go!
- I'm on it.

892
01:33:43,755 --> 01:33:44,798
Kayla!

893
01:33:45,809 --> 01:33:46,851
Kayla!

894
01:33:55,896 --> 01:33:57,939
I love you.

895
01:34:05,489 --> 01:34:06,406
No...

896
01:34:09,993 --> 01:34:11,495
I'm so cold.

897
01:34:11,495 --> 01:34:14,498
Listen to me, I'm gonna
get you outta here.

898
01:34:14,498 --> 01:34:15,457
You understand?

899
01:34:16,416 --> 01:34:17,542
Let's go easy,
nice and easy.

900
01:34:17,918 --> 01:34:18,710
That's it.

901
01:34:18,710 --> 01:34:19,669
That's it.

902
01:34:23,048 --> 01:34:24,841
I'm gonna get you out.

903
01:34:48,463 --> 01:34:49,506
Logan!

904
01:35:45,088 --> 01:35:46,798
I should make you
pull the trigger.

905
01:35:48,467 --> 01:35:50,677
But that would make
us no better than you.

906
01:35:52,471 --> 01:35:54,264
Throw the gun away.

907
01:35:59,561 --> 01:36:01,063
Turn around.
Walk until your feet bleed.

908
01:36:02,773 --> 01:36:04,357
And then keep walking.

909
01:36:42,312 --> 01:36:44,606
<i>It'll be all right, Scott.</i>

910
01:36:44,606 --> 01:36:46,942
<i>My name is Charles Xavier.</i>

911
01:36:46,942 --> 01:36:49,236
<i>I'm a mutant, like you.</i>

912
01:36:49,236 --> 01:36:53,824
<i>- I can hear your thoughts.
- Yes. And I can hear yours.</i>

913
01:36:54,032 --> 01:36:56,243
You're safe now.

914
01:36:56,243 --> 01:36:58,537
<i>Come. We have to go.</i>

915
01:37:47,815 --> 01:37:48,691
The kids are safe.

916
01:37:54,572 --> 01:37:55,781
What the hell happened?

917
01:37:59,368 --> 01:38:02,330
- Who are you?
- What do you mean, who am I?

918
01:38:02,705 --> 01:38:04,999
I'm the guy who brought you here.
Now we gotta go.

919
01:38:06,375 --> 01:38:08,419
Where the hell am I?

920
01:38:08,628 --> 01:38:11,005
Listen to me, I am a friend.

921
01:38:11,213 --> 01:38:12,423
I'm a friend.

922
01:38:12,423 --> 01:38:14,008
What's my name?

923
01:38:14,008 --> 01:38:15,551
What's my name!

924
01:38:15,760 --> 01:38:17,970
Your name is Logan.

925
01:38:21,223 --> 01:38:23,935
You need to trust me.
We have to go.

926
01:38:29,482 --> 01:38:31,108
Follow me.

927
01:38:36,489 --> 01:38:37,281
Now!

928
01:39:11,232 --> 01:39:12,942
Do you know her?

929
01:39:16,737 --> 01:39:17,738
No.

930
01:39:22,868 --> 01:39:24,829
These dudes are not gonna like
what you've done in this place.

931
01:39:24,829 --> 01:39:27,248
We really need to go.

932
01:39:27,248 --> 01:39:29,417
I'll find my own way.

933
01:39:34,171 --> 01:39:35,464
Good luck.

934
01:41:07,014 --> 01:41:09,016
Colonel Stryker?

935
01:41:12,824 --> 01:41:16,328
- Colonel William Stryker?
- Yes.

936
01:41:17,704 --> 01:41:18,747
You're wanted for questioning...

937
01:41:18,956 --> 01:41:21,876
in connection of the death
of General Munson.

938
01:41:21,876 --> 01:41:22,919
Sir.

178
00:09:27,606 --> 00:09:28,732
Oh, I can't do that.

179
00:09:29,692 --> 00:09:30,968
I'm just another
asshole customer.

180
00:09:31,068 --> 00:09:33,596
You can't just walk up
to a waitress and ask her out.

181
00:09:33,696 --> 00:09:35,739
Besides, I'm still trying
to work it out with Anne.

182
00:09:36,615 --> 00:09:39,518
Oh, that reminds me.
I can't play poker on Friday.

183
00:09:39,618 --> 00:09:40,895
Why not?

184
00:09:40,995 --> 00:09:44,982
I'm gonna see this occupational
hypnotherapist with Anne.

185
00:09:45,082 --> 00:09:47,401
Dude,
an occupational hypnotherapist?

186
00:09:47,501 --> 00:09:49,862
PETER:
I know. Anne wants me to go.

187
00:09:49,962 --> 00:09:51,255
She thinks it might help.

188
00:09:52,089 --> 00:09:53,949
Um...

189
00:09:54,049 --> 00:09:56,410
You know,
sometimes I think that...

190
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:59,038
I get thinking
that she's cheating on me.

191
00:09:59,138 --> 00:10:00,498
Yeah. I know what you mean.

192
00:10:00,598 --> 00:10:02,099
Yeah.

193
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:04,476
What is that supposed to mean?

194
00:10:05,853 --> 00:10:06,979
Nothing.

195
00:10:08,022 --> 00:10:10,216
Why don't you just tell Anne
that you're not into hypnosis...

196
00:10:10,316 --> 00:10:11,383
and you wanna play poker
with us?

197
00:10:11,483 --> 00:10:13,010
I can't do that.
She'll get all pissed off...

198
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:17,431
and, besides, I think the guy
might actually be able to help.

199
00:10:17,531 --> 00:10:19,116
I mean,
he did help Anne lose weight.

200
00:10:19,992 --> 00:10:21,352
Peter, she's anorexic.

201
00:10:21,452 --> 00:10:23,229
Yeah, I know.

202
00:10:23,329 --> 00:10:24,663
The guy's really good.

203
00:10:25,831 --> 00:10:28,275
Yeah, well, I don't think any
occupational hypnotherapist...

204
00:10:28,375 --> 00:10:30,069
is gonna help you solve
any of your problems.

205
00:10:30,169 --> 00:10:31,862
Hey, and speaking of problems...

206
00:10:31,962 --> 00:10:33,447
what's this I hear about you
having problems...

207
00:10:33,547 --> 00:10:34,782
with your T.P.S. reports?

208
00:10:34,882 --> 00:10:37,218
SAMIR:
Yeah. Didn't you get that memo?

209
00:10:39,595 --> 00:10:41,372
TOM: Hey! Hey, guys! Peter!

210
00:10:41,472 --> 00:10:43,098
SAMIR: ls that Smykowski?

211
00:10:43,933 --> 00:10:45,084
-Samir!
-What's he doing?

212
00:10:45,184 --> 00:10:46,836
MICHAEL: Oh, probably workin' on
another heart attack.

213
00:10:46,936 --> 00:10:48,712
TOM: I've been lookin'
all over for you guys!

214
00:10:48,812 --> 00:10:51,507
Have you seen this?
I knew it. I knew it.

215
00:10:51,607 --> 00:10:53,217
PETER: What?
It's a staff meeting. So what?

216
00:10:53,317 --> 00:10:55,845
TOM: So what?
We're all screwed. That's what.

217
00:10:55,945 --> 00:10:57,555
They're gonna downsize lnitech.

218
00:10:57,655 --> 00:10:59,849
SAMIR: What are you talking
about? How do you know that?

219
00:10:59,949 --> 00:11:02,101
TOM: How do I know? They're
bringing in a consultant.

220
00:11:02,201 --> 00:11:03,269
That's how I know.

221
00:11:03,369 --> 00:11:05,062
That's what this staff meeting's
all about.

222
00:11:05,162 --> 00:11:06,981
It happened
at lnitrode last year.

223
00:11:07,081 --> 00:11:08,816
You have to interview
with this consultant.

224
00:11:08,916 --> 00:11:10,609
They call them
efficiency experts...

225
00:11:10,709 --> 00:11:11,861
but what you're really doing...

226
00:11:11,961 --> 00:11:13,279
is interviewing
for your own job.

227
00:11:13,379 --> 00:11:14,697
MICHAEL: Every week you say
you're gonna lose your job...

228
00:11:14,797 --> 00:11:15,948
and you're still here.

229
00:11:16,048 --> 00:11:18,409
TOM: Not this time. I bet
I'm the first one laid off.

230
00:11:18,509 --> 00:11:20,619
The thought of having to go to
the state unemployment office...

231
00:11:20,719 --> 00:11:22,747
and stand in line
with those scumbags...

232
00:11:22,847 --> 00:11:24,223
SAMIR: Shit.

233
00:11:25,558 --> 00:11:27,251
TOM: You know there are people
in this world...

234
00:11:27,351 --> 00:11:29,754
that don't have to put up
with all this shit?

235
00:11:29,854 --> 00:11:32,022
Like that guy
that invented the pet rock.

236
00:11:32,857 --> 00:11:35,276
You see,
that's what you have to do.

237
00:11:36,068 --> 00:11:38,137
You have to use your mind...

238
00:11:38,237 --> 00:11:40,306
and come up with some really
great idea like that...

239
00:11:40,406 --> 00:11:42,725
and you can make millions--
never have to work again.

240
00:11:42,825 --> 00:11:44,935
MICHAEL: You think the pet rock
was a really great idea?

241
00:11:45,035 --> 00:11:46,812
Sure it was.

242
00:11:46,912 --> 00:11:49,039
The guy made a million dollars.

243
00:11:51,667 --> 00:11:54,403
You know, I had an idea
like that once...

244
00:11:54,503 --> 00:11:55,921
a long time ago.

245
00:11:57,173 --> 00:11:58,632
PETER: Really? What was it, Tom?

246
00:11:59,341 --> 00:12:01,160
Well, all right.

247
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:05,222
It was
a "Jump to Conclusions" mat.

248
00:12:06,807 --> 00:12:09,085
You see, it would be this mat...

249
00:12:09,185 --> 00:12:11,337
that you would
put on the floor...

250
00:12:11,437 --> 00:12:15,633
and it would have different
conclusions written on it...

251
00:12:15,733 --> 00:12:18,027
that you could jump to.

252
00:12:23,073 --> 00:12:25,309
MICHAEL: That is the worst idea
I've ever heard in my life, Tom.

253
00:12:25,409 --> 00:12:29,121
SAMIR: Yes. Yes, it's horrible,
this idea.

254
00:12:31,582 --> 00:12:33,192
Uh, look...

255
00:12:33,292 --> 00:12:34,543
I gotta get outta here.

256
00:12:35,419 --> 00:12:36,404
I'll see you guys later...

257
00:12:36,504 --> 00:12:38,464
if I still have a job.

258
00:12:39,298 --> 00:12:40,366
MICHAEL: Yeah.

259
00:12:40,466 --> 00:12:42,243
Our high school
guidance counselor...

260
00:12:42,343 --> 00:12:44,662
used to ask us what you would do
if you had a million dollars...

261
00:12:44,762 --> 00:12:45,830
didn't have to work...

262
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:49,125
and whatever you'd say
was supposed to be your career.

263
00:12:49,225 --> 00:12:50,668
So if you wanted
to fix old cars...

264
00:12:50,768 --> 00:12:52,503
then you're supposed
to be an auto mechanic.

265
00:12:52,603 --> 00:12:53,712
SAMIR: So what did you say?

266
00:12:53,812 --> 00:12:55,648
I never had an answer.

267
00:12:56,607 --> 00:12:58,342
I guess that's why
I'm working at lnitech.

268
00:12:58,442 --> 00:12:59,885
No. You're working at lnitech...

269
00:12:59,985 --> 00:13:02,012
'cause that question
is bullshit to begin with.

270
00:13:02,112 --> 00:13:03,722
If everyone listened to her,
there'd be no janitors...

271
00:13:03,822 --> 00:13:06,100
because no one would clean shit
if they had a million dollars.

272
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,561
SAMIR: You know what I would do
if I had a million dollars?

273
00:13:08,661 --> 00:13:11,814
I would invest half of it
in glorious mutual funds...

274
00:13:11,914 --> 00:13:14,275
and then take the other half
to my friend Asadulah...

275
00:13:14,375 --> 00:13:15,443
who works in securities--

276
00:13:15,543 --> 00:13:17,695
MICHAEL: Samir. Samir,
you're missing the point.

277
00:13:17,795 --> 00:13:19,363
The point of the exercise is
you're supposed to figure out...

278
00:13:19,463 --> 00:13:21,966
what you would want to do if--

279
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:25,970
"PC load letter"?
What the fuck does that mean?

280
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:45,072
[Turns on television]

281
00:13:48,075 --> 00:13:50,895
LAWRENCE: Hey, Peter, man!
Check out channel nine!

282
00:13:50,995 --> 00:13:52,146
Check out this chick!

283
00:13:52,246 --> 00:13:54,648
Damn it! Lawrence,
can't you just pretend...

284
00:13:54,748 --> 00:13:56,734
Iike we can't hear
each other through the wall?

285
00:13:56,834 --> 00:13:59,070
LAWRENCE: Oh, sorry, man!
Anne over there or somethin'?

286
00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:00,296
No, but...

287
00:14:01,338 --> 00:14:03,799
If you want to talk to me,
just come over.

288
00:14:07,178 --> 00:14:10,264
Hey, man, check this out, dude.

289
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:15,086
ANNOUNCER:
The key is early detection.

290
00:14:15,186 --> 00:14:16,253
Tumors that are detected--

291
00:14:16,353 --> 00:14:18,255
Aw, jeez, Lawrence.

292
00:14:18,355 --> 00:14:20,149
LAWRENCE: Sorry, man. I thought
you'd want to see this.

293
00:14:21,275 --> 00:14:22,635
Doesn't that chick
look like Anne?

294
00:14:22,735 --> 00:14:24,303
Yeah.

295
00:14:24,403 --> 00:14:25,596
A little bit. I...

296
00:14:25,696 --> 00:14:27,473
Hey, she hasn't been over here
in a while.

297
00:14:27,573 --> 00:14:28,933
You two still goin' out?

298
00:14:29,033 --> 00:14:30,643
Yeah.

299
00:14:30,743 --> 00:14:32,228
I guess. I--I don't know.

300
00:14:32,328 --> 00:14:34,605
Sometimes I get the feeling
like she's cheating on me.

301
00:14:34,705 --> 00:14:36,832
Yeah. I get that feeling,
too, man.

302
00:14:38,334 --> 00:14:39,777
What do you mean by that?

303
00:14:39,877 --> 00:14:41,378
I don't know, man.

304
00:14:42,213 --> 00:14:44,448
I just get that feeling
lookin' at her, like...

305
00:14:44,548 --> 00:14:46,884
she's the type of chick
that just...

306
00:14:47,927 --> 00:14:49,094
Uhh.

307
00:14:52,014 --> 00:14:54,125
Oh, I'm sorry, man. Look, l--I--

308
00:14:54,225 --> 00:14:56,293
You know,
I'm talkin' outta my ass.

309
00:14:56,393 --> 00:14:57,711
PETER: Forget it. Don't worry.
It's all right.

310
00:14:57,811 --> 00:14:59,463
Just--I had a rough day.

311
00:14:59,563 --> 00:15:01,215
LAWRENCE: Tell me about it, man.

312
00:15:01,315 --> 00:15:02,733
Ohh...

313
00:15:03,776 --> 00:15:05,511
Ooh, I gotta wake my ass up...

314
00:15:05,611 --> 00:15:08,639
at six a.m.
every day this week...

315
00:15:08,739 --> 00:15:10,808
drag up to Las Golindas.

316
00:15:10,908 --> 00:15:13,702
I'm doin' the drywall up there
at the new McDonald's.

317
00:15:14,328 --> 00:15:15,496
Let me ask you something.

318
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:19,066
When you come in on Monday, and
you're not feelin' real well...

319
00:15:19,166 --> 00:15:20,317
does anyone ever say to you...

320
00:15:20,417 --> 00:15:22,878
"Sounds like someone
has a case of the Mondays"?

321
00:15:24,547 --> 00:15:25,714
No.

322
00:15:26,549 --> 00:15:27,967
No, man.

323
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:30,619
Shit, no, man.

324
00:15:30,719 --> 00:15:33,289
You'd get your ass kicked,
sayin' something like that, man.

325
00:15:33,389 --> 00:15:34,957
PETER: Huh.

326
00:15:35,057 --> 00:15:36,459
LAWRENCE: We still goin' fishin'
this weekend?

327
00:15:36,559 --> 00:15:38,627
Ah, Lumbergh's gonna have me
come in on Saturday.

328
00:15:38,727 --> 00:15:39,795
I just know it.

329
00:15:39,895 --> 00:15:41,297
LAWRENCE: Well, you can
get out of that easily.

330
00:15:41,397 --> 00:15:43,424
PETER: Yeah? How?

331
00:15:43,524 --> 00:15:44,692
Well...

332
00:15:45,401 --> 00:15:47,178
when a boss wants you
to work on Saturday...

333
00:15:47,278 --> 00:15:50,222
he generally asks you
at the end of the day, right?

334
00:15:50,322 --> 00:15:51,348
PETER: Yeah.

335
00:15:51,448 --> 00:15:53,434
LAWRENCE: So all you gotta do is
avoid him--that's all right...

336
00:15:53,534 --> 00:15:55,728
I got it--on the last few hours
on Friday...

337
00:15:55,828 --> 00:15:57,646
duck out early...

338
00:15:57,746 --> 00:15:59,315
turn off
your answering machine...

339
00:15:59,415 --> 00:16:01,083
you should be home free, man.

340
00:16:03,502 --> 00:16:05,212
That's a really good idea.

341
00:16:06,088 --> 00:16:07,256
Fuckin' "A," man.

342
00:16:08,048 --> 00:16:12,828
Lawrence, what would you do
if you had a million dollars?

343
00:16:12,928 --> 00:16:14,805
I'll tell you what I'd do, man.

344
00:16:15,973 --> 00:16:18,142
Two chicks
at the same time, man.

345
00:16:22,605 --> 00:16:24,048
That's it?

346
00:16:24,148 --> 00:16:25,341
If you had a million dollars...

347
00:16:25,441 --> 00:16:27,426
you'd do two chicks
at the same time?

348
00:16:27,526 --> 00:16:30,262
Damn straight. I've always
wanted to do that, man.

349
00:16:30,362 --> 00:16:33,140
I think if I were a millionaire,
I could hook that up, too...

350
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,934
'cause chicks dig dudes
with money.

351
00:16:35,034 --> 00:16:36,393
Well, not all chicks.

352
00:16:36,493 --> 00:16:39,230
The type of chicks that would
double up on a dude like me do.

353
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:40,439
Good point.

354
00:16:40,539 --> 00:16:42,483
LAWRENCE: What about you, now?
What would you do?

355
00:16:42,583 --> 00:16:43,943
Besides two chicks
at the same time?

356
00:16:44,043 --> 00:16:45,194
Well, yeah.

357
00:16:45,294 --> 00:16:46,779
Nothing.

358
00:16:46,879 --> 00:16:48,964
Nothin', huh?

359
00:16:49,089 --> 00:16:51,158
I would relax.

360
00:16:51,258 --> 00:16:53,385
I would sit on my ass all day.

361
00:16:55,054 --> 00:16:56,622
I would do nothing.

362
00:16:56,722 --> 00:16:59,333
You don't need a million dollars
to do nothin', man.

363
00:16:59,433 --> 00:17:00,835
Take a look at my cousin.

364
00:17:00,935 --> 00:17:02,937
He's broke, don't do shit.

365
00:17:06,315 --> 00:17:08,759
NINA: Corporate accounts
payable. Nina speaking.

366
00:17:08,859 --> 00:17:10,261
Just a moment.

367
00:17:10,361 --> 00:17:12,763
Corporate accounts payable.
Nina speaking.

368
00:17:12,863 --> 00:17:14,682
Just a moment.

369
00:17:14,782 --> 00:17:17,017
Corporate accounts payable.
Nina speaking.

370
00:17:17,117 --> 00:17:18,702
Just a moment.

371
00:17:19,662 --> 00:17:21,355
BILL:
So, you should ask yourself...

372
00:17:21,455 --> 00:17:23,983
with every decision you make...

373
00:17:24,083 --> 00:17:26,193
"ls this good for the company?

374
00:17:26,293 --> 00:17:27,987
"Am I helping with..."

375
00:17:28,087 --> 00:17:29,530
PETER: ls that the guy?

376
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:31,841
TOM: Yeah. We're screwed.

377
00:17:31,966 --> 00:17:34,426
BILL: OK, then, um...

378
00:17:35,344 --> 00:17:37,913
I'd like to go ahead
and welcome, uh...

379
00:17:38,013 --> 00:17:40,332
a new member to our team here.

380
00:17:40,432 --> 00:17:41,767
This is, uh...

381
00:17:42,977 --> 00:17:44,353
Bob Slydell.

382
00:17:46,021 --> 00:17:47,923
Yeah. Uh...

383
00:17:48,023 --> 00:17:50,401
Bob is a consultant.

384
00:17:51,652 --> 00:17:54,071
Yeah. He's gonna be
sort of, uh...

385
00:17:55,614 --> 00:17:56,682
helping us out...

386
00:17:56,782 --> 00:17:58,184
a little here...

387
00:17:58,284 --> 00:17:59,685
asking some questions...

388
00:17:59,785 --> 00:18:01,270
maybe seeing
if there are some ways...

389
00:18:01,370 --> 00:18:03,981
we can make things run
a little more smoothly...

390
00:18:04,081 --> 00:18:05,249
around here.

391
00:18:06,333 --> 00:18:08,069
Yeah.

392
00:18:08,169 --> 00:18:10,488
Oh, and remember, next Friday...

393
00:18:10,588 --> 00:18:12,923
is Hawaiian shirt day.

394
00:18:14,758 --> 00:18:18,454
So, you know, if you want to,
go ahead and, uh....

395
00:18:18,554 --> 00:18:20,181
wear a Hawaiian shirt and jeans.

396
00:18:21,390 --> 00:18:24,043
And I said I don't care
if they lay me off, either.

397
00:18:24,143 --> 00:18:25,294
Because I told Bill...

398
00:18:25,394 --> 00:18:27,838
that if they move my desk
one more time...

399
00:18:27,938 --> 00:18:30,674
then I'm--I'm quitting.
I'm going to quit...

400
00:18:30,774 --> 00:18:32,218
and I told Dom, too...

401
00:18:32,318 --> 00:18:35,513
because they've moved my desk
four times already this year...

402
00:18:35,613 --> 00:18:37,765
and I used to be over
by the window...

403
00:18:37,865 --> 00:18:41,060
and I could see the squirrels,
and they were married...

404
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:43,312
but then they switched
from the Swingline...

405
00:18:43,412 --> 00:18:45,815
to the Boston stapler, but
I kept my Swingline stapler...

406
00:18:45,915 --> 00:18:47,858
because it didn't
bind up as much...

407
00:18:47,958 --> 00:18:50,528
and I kept the staples
for the Swingline stapler.

408
00:18:50,628 --> 00:18:51,654
PETER: OK, Milton.

409
00:18:51,754 --> 00:18:53,864
MILTON: No, it's not OK,
because if they make me--

410
00:18:53,964 --> 00:18:57,368
If they take my stapler,
then I'll--I'll--I'll--

411
00:18:57,468 --> 00:18:59,662
I'll set the building on fire.

412
00:18:59,762 --> 00:19:01,956
PETER:
OK, well, that sounds great.

413
00:19:02,056 --> 00:19:03,791
Uh, I'll talk to you later,
all right? Bye.

414
00:19:03,891 --> 00:19:05,100
MILTON: Peter--

415
00:19:21,033 --> 00:19:22,243
BILL: Good-bye.

416
00:19:44,723 --> 00:19:46,100
Come on.

417
00:19:48,519 --> 00:19:50,229
Oh, for cryin'--

418
00:20:12,042 --> 00:20:14,487
Hello, Peter. What's happening?

419
00:20:14,587 --> 00:20:16,197
Um...

420
00:20:16,297 --> 00:20:18,199
I'm gonna need you...

421
00:20:18,299 --> 00:20:20,117
to go ahead
and come in tomorrow...

422
00:20:20,217 --> 00:20:24,330
so if you could be here
around...

423
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:26,874
nine, that would be great.

424
00:20:26,974 --> 00:20:28,184
OK?

425
00:20:29,935 --> 00:20:31,879
Oh, oh, and I almost forgot.

426
00:20:31,979 --> 00:20:33,714
Um...

427
00:20:33,814 --> 00:20:36,550
I'm also gonna need you
to go ahead and come in...

428
00:20:36,650 --> 00:20:39,178
on Sunday, too, OK?

429
00:20:39,278 --> 00:20:40,888
We, um...

430
00:20:40,988 --> 00:20:42,765
Iost some people this week...

431
00:20:42,865 --> 00:20:44,892
and, uh...

432
00:20:44,992 --> 00:20:46,977
we need to sort of play
catch-up.

433
00:20:47,077 --> 00:20:48,329
Thanks.

434
00:20:52,374 --> 00:20:53,901
PETER: So I was sitting
in my cubicle today...

435
00:20:54,001 --> 00:20:58,005
and I realized, ever since
I started working, um...

436
00:20:59,298 --> 00:21:01,742
every single day of my life
has been worse than...

437
00:21:01,842 --> 00:21:03,511
the day before it.

438
00:21:04,428 --> 00:21:08,182
So that means that every single
day that you see me...

439
00:21:09,141 --> 00:21:11,018
that's on the worst day
of my life.

440
00:21:11,769 --> 00:21:13,170
What about today?

441
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:14,505
Is today
the worst day of your life?

442
00:21:14,605 --> 00:21:17,233
-Yeah.
-Wow. That's messed up.

443
00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:21,637
I'm sorry.

444
00:21:21,737 --> 00:21:22,930
Go on.

445
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:26,517
PETER: ls there any way
that you could sort of...

446
00:21:26,617 --> 00:21:29,353
just zonk me out so that, like,
I don't know...

447
00:21:29,453 --> 00:21:31,897
that I'm at work...in here?

448
00:21:31,997 --> 00:21:33,399
Could I come home...

449
00:21:33,499 --> 00:21:36,944
and think that I've been fishing
all day or something?

450
00:21:37,044 --> 00:21:39,697
That's...really not what I do,
Peter.

451
00:21:39,797 --> 00:21:41,073
Heh.

452
00:21:41,173 --> 00:21:42,341
However...

453
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:45,886
the good news is,
I think I can help you.

454
00:21:46,804 --> 00:21:49,014
I want you to do something
for me, Peter.

455
00:21:50,683 --> 00:21:52,893
I want you to try and relax.

456
00:21:56,438 --> 00:21:59,383
I want you to relax
every muscle in your body...

457
00:21:59,483 --> 00:22:03,779
beginning with your toes
to your fingertips.

458
00:22:06,532 --> 00:22:08,701
Now I want you
to relax your legs.

459
00:22:10,077 --> 00:22:12,705
You're beginning to feel
your eyelids getting heavy...

460
00:22:13,831 --> 00:22:16,025
as you slip deeper and deeper...

461
00:22:16,125 --> 00:22:19,403
into a state
of complete relaxation.

462
00:22:19,503 --> 00:22:23,657
All your cares and concerns
are disappearing.

463
00:22:23,757 --> 00:22:25,242
Deeper and deeper.

464
00:22:25,342 --> 00:22:27,244
Way down.

465
00:22:27,344 --> 00:22:29,555
Your concern about your job...

466
00:22:30,347 --> 00:22:32,541
melts away...

467
00:22:32,641 --> 00:22:34,543
way...

468
00:22:34,643 --> 00:22:36,045
way down.

469
00:22:36,145 --> 00:22:37,521
Unh.

470
00:22:40,107 --> 00:22:41,984
Now, when I count backwards
from three...

471
00:22:42,693 --> 00:22:45,429
you'll be in a state
of complete relaxation.

472
00:22:45,529 --> 00:22:48,532
Your worries, cares,
and inhibitions will be gone...

473
00:22:49,325 --> 00:22:51,202
and you will remain
in that state...

474
00:22:52,411 --> 00:22:54,688
until I snap my fingers.

475
00:22:54,788 --> 00:22:56,232
Three.

476
00:22:56,332 --> 00:22:58,025
Deeper and deeper.

477
00:22:58,125 --> 00:22:59,735
Way...

478
00:22:59,835 --> 00:23:01,278
way down.

479
00:23:01,378 --> 00:23:03,280
Two.

480
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:05,408
Deeper and deeper...

481
00:23:05,508 --> 00:23:08,285

that we did start

528
00:25:21,685 --> 00:25:24,505
then you walk out and embarrass
me in front of my friends...

529
00:25:24,605 --> 00:25:26,257
and don't blame this
on hypnosis, either.

530
00:25:26,357 --> 00:25:28,150
-That's total bull--
-[Hangs up]

531
00:25:32,112 --> 00:25:34,098
[Telephone rings,
machine beeps]

532
00:25:34,198 --> 00:25:36,308
ANNE: Listen, asshole.
Nobody hangs up on me.

533
00:25:36,408 --> 00:25:37,852
We're through.

534
00:25:37,952 --> 00:25:39,854
Oh, and one more thing...

535
00:25:39,954 --> 00:25:42,022
I've been cheating on you!

536
00:25:42,122 --> 00:25:44,625
[Anne hangs up, machine beeps]

537
00:25:47,211 --> 00:25:49,947
BILL: So, from now on,
only use the new time sheets...

538
00:25:50,047 --> 00:25:54,535
if you've worked on two or more
job codes in one day...

539
00:25:54,635 --> 00:25:57,621
and you need the extra columns
to fit it all in.

540
00:25:57,721 --> 00:25:58,956
Otherwise,
use the old time sheets--

541
00:25:59,056 --> 00:26:00,541
TOM: Where's Peter?

542
00:26:00,641 --> 00:26:02,001
I heard he didn't show up
this weekend.

543
00:26:02,101 --> 00:26:03,169
MICHAEL: Uh, I don't know.

544
00:26:03,269 --> 00:26:04,754
BILL:
...really, really help us out.

545
00:26:04,854 --> 00:26:06,297
MICHAEL: Who's that guy?

546
00:26:06,397 --> 00:26:10,067
BILL: So, uh...any questions?

547
00:26:23,706 --> 00:26:25,191
Hi. I'm Peter.

548
00:26:25,291 --> 00:26:26,358
JOANNA: Hi. Can I help you?

549
00:26:26,458 --> 00:26:27,568
PETER: What are you doin'
for lunch today?

550
00:26:27,668 --> 00:26:31,197
Uh, well, our specials today
are blackened chicken.

551
00:26:31,297 --> 00:26:33,549
It's actually right there
on the board. Excuse me.

552
00:26:36,719 --> 00:26:37,995
BRIAN: Hey, look who's back!

553
00:26:38,095 --> 00:26:39,847
Table for three to--

554
00:26:42,683 --> 00:26:44,585
PETER: I was askin'
what you were doin' for lunch.

555
00:26:44,685 --> 00:26:46,312
Would you like to have lunch
with me?

556
00:26:47,897 --> 00:26:49,090
Are you--are you serious?

557
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:50,357
PETER: Yeah.

558
00:26:51,525 --> 00:26:54,612
Yeah. I--I don't think
I'm supposed to do that.

559
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:57,640
Oh. OK, well,
I'll tell you what I'll do.

560
00:26:57,740 --> 00:26:59,141
I'm gonna go next door
and get a table...

561
00:26:59,241 --> 00:27:00,851
and if you'd like
to join me, uh...

562
00:27:00,951 --> 00:27:02,144
no big deal, all right?

563
00:27:02,244 --> 00:27:04,105
And if not, that's cool, too.

564
00:27:04,205 --> 00:27:05,397
-OK?
-OK.

565
00:27:05,497 --> 00:27:06,665
PETER: All right.

566
00:27:07,666 --> 00:27:08,734
JOANNA: When you say,
"next door..."

567
00:27:08,834 --> 00:27:11,320
do you mean
Chili's or Flinger's?

568
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:13,030
PETER: Flinger's.

569
00:27:13,130 --> 00:27:14,298
JOANNA: OK.

570
00:27:15,591 --> 00:27:17,785
What you do at lnitech...

571
00:27:17,885 --> 00:27:20,663
is you take the specifications
from the customers...

572
00:27:20,763 --> 00:27:23,165
and you bring them down
to the software engineers?

573
00:27:23,265 --> 00:27:25,501
TOM: Yes. Y-yes.
That's--that's right.

574
00:27:25,601 --> 00:27:27,211
PORTER:
Well, then I just have to ask...

575
00:27:27,311 --> 00:27:28,504
why couldn't the customers...

576
00:27:28,604 --> 00:27:32,133
just take them directly
to the software people, huh?

577
00:27:32,233 --> 00:27:34,235
TOM: Well, I'll tell you why.

578
00:27:35,611 --> 00:27:37,179
Uh, because...

579
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:40,516
engineers are not good
at dealing with customers.

580
00:27:40,616 --> 00:27:42,284
SLYDELL: Uh-huh. So...

581
00:27:43,285 --> 00:27:47,998
you physically take the specs
from the customer?

582
00:27:48,958 --> 00:27:50,167
Well...

583
00:27:51,585 --> 00:27:54,697
no. My secretary does that
or the fax.

584
00:27:54,797 --> 00:27:56,490
SLYDELL: Huh.

585
00:27:56,590 --> 00:27:58,284
PORTER: So then you must
physically bring them...

586
00:27:58,384 --> 00:27:59,410
to the software people.

587
00:27:59,510 --> 00:28:00,594
Well...

588
00:28:01,971 --> 00:28:03,038
no.

589
00:28:03,138 --> 00:28:04,373
I mean...

590
00:28:04,473 --> 00:28:05,958
sometimes.

591
00:28:06,058 --> 00:28:10,312
SLYDELL: What--what would you
say you do here?

592
00:28:11,438 --> 00:28:13,466
Well, look,
I already told you.

593
00:28:13,566 --> 00:28:15,801
I deal with
the goddamn customers...

594
00:28:15,901 --> 00:28:17,720
so the engineers don't have to.

595
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:19,805
I have people skills.

596
00:28:19,905 --> 00:28:21,891
I am good at dealing
with people!

597
00:28:21,991 --> 00:28:23,309
Can't you understand that?!

598
00:28:23,409 --> 00:28:25,853
What the hell is wrong
with you people?!

599
00:28:25,953 --> 00:28:27,162
I--

600
00:28:33,836 --> 00:28:34,904
SLYDELL: Let's see...

601
00:28:35,004 --> 00:28:37,156
you are...

602
00:28:37,256 --> 00:28:38,549
Michael...

603
00:28:40,009 --> 00:28:42,678
-Bolton?
-Yeah.

604
00:28:44,096 --> 00:28:45,264
PORTER:
ls that your real name?

605
00:28:46,015 --> 00:28:47,183
MICHAEL: Yeah.

606
00:28:49,226 --> 00:28:51,253
SLYDELL: Are you any relation
to the pop singer?

607
00:28:51,353 --> 00:28:53,339
MICHAEL: No, it's--it's
just a coincidence.

608
00:28:53,439 --> 00:28:54,965
SLYDELL: Ha ha.
To be honest with you...

609
00:28:55,065 --> 00:28:56,675
I love his music. I do.

610
00:28:56,775 --> 00:28:58,928
-I'm a Michael Bolton fan.
-Me, too.

611
00:28:59,028 --> 00:29:00,638
SLYDELL: For my money, I don't
know if it gets any better...

612
00:29:00,738 --> 00:29:03,140
than when he sings
"When a Man Loves a Woman."

613
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:05,142
But you must really
love his music, huh?

614
00:29:05,242 --> 00:29:07,978
[Men laugh]

615
00:29:08,078 --> 00:29:09,355
Yeah, he's--he's...

616
00:29:09,455 --> 00:29:11,148
he's pretty--
he's pretty good, I guess.

617
00:29:11,248 --> 00:29:12,817
You're goddamn right, he is.

618
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:15,361
-[Men laugh]
-Right.

619
00:29:15,461 --> 00:29:17,922
PORTER: So tell me, what's
your favorite song of his?

620
00:29:18,839 --> 00:29:20,257
Mmm...

621
00:29:21,592 --> 00:29:22,910
[Michael clears throat]

622
00:29:23,010 --> 00:29:24,995
I don't--I don't know.
Heh heh.

623
00:29:25,095 --> 00:29:27,415
I mean, I guess I sort
of like them all.

624
00:29:27,515 --> 00:29:30,626
SLYDELL: That's a riot.
I'm the exact same way.

625
00:29:30,726 --> 00:29:31,961
But it must be twice
as hard for you...

626
00:29:32,061 --> 00:29:33,462
being you have
the same name as him.

627
00:29:33,562 --> 00:29:36,424
I celebrate
the guy's entire catalog.

628
00:29:36,524 --> 00:29:39,009
Anyway, let's get down
to business, Michael.

629
00:29:39,109 --> 00:29:41,278
You know,
you can just call me Mike.

630
00:29:46,742 --> 00:29:47,810
Hi.

631
00:29:47,910 --> 00:29:49,203
Hey.

632
00:29:51,121 --> 00:29:54,041
I wonder if I'm allowed
to, uh, wear this in here?

633
00:29:54,875 --> 00:29:56,210
I think it would be OK.

634
00:29:57,878 --> 00:29:58,946
Would you like to sit down?

635
00:29:59,046 --> 00:30:00,256
OK.

636
00:30:01,423 --> 00:30:02,591
Ahh.

637
00:30:04,093 --> 00:30:05,202
Wow!

638
00:30:05,302 --> 00:30:08,038
This place is really...nice.

639
00:30:08,138 --> 00:30:10,416
Yeah. Is it?

640
00:30:10,516 --> 00:30:12,710
JOANNA: Yeah, my God,
compared to Chotchkie's!

641
00:30:12,810 --> 00:30:15,104
I like the uniforms better,
anyways.

642
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:17,047
I like yours.

643
00:30:17,147 --> 00:30:18,315
JOANNA: Ugh!

644
00:30:21,569 --> 00:30:23,137
"We're not in Kansas anymore."

645
00:30:23,237 --> 00:30:25,264
JOANNA: Yeah.

646
00:30:25,364 --> 00:30:27,725
Really. Ha ha.

647
00:30:27,825 --> 00:30:29,243
It's on your...

648
00:30:30,578 --> 00:30:32,730
Ohh! Yeah. That's...

649
00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:34,732
That's, uh...

650
00:30:34,832 --> 00:30:37,777
That's one of my--
my pieces of flair.

651
00:30:37,877 --> 00:30:38,944
PETER:
What's a "piece of flair"?

652
00:30:39,044 --> 00:30:41,030
JOANNA:
Oh, it's, uh, where, you know...

653
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:44,658
Iike these suspenders and, uh,
buttons, they're all sort of...

654
00:30:44,758 --> 00:30:46,786
We're actually required
to wear...

655
00:30:46,886 --> 00:30:49,830
um, fifteen pieces of flair.

656
00:30:49,930 --> 00:30:52,083
It's really stupid, actually.

657
00:30:52,183 --> 00:30:53,375
Do you get to pick 'em
yourself?

658
00:30:53,475 --> 00:30:54,919
JOANNA: Yeah, yeah, we do.

659
00:30:55,019 --> 00:30:56,128
Although I didn't actually
choose these.

660
00:30:56,228 --> 00:31:00,508
I just sort of grabbed,
you know, fifteen buttons.

661
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:03,277
I don't even know what they say.
I don't really care.

662
00:31:03,986 --> 00:31:05,554
I don't really like
talking about my flair.

663
00:31:05,654 --> 00:31:07,056
OK.

664
00:31:07,156 --> 00:31:10,101
JOANNA:
So, where do you, work, Peter?

665
00:31:10,201 --> 00:31:11,685
PETER: lnitech.

666
00:31:11,785 --> 00:31:13,579
JOANNA: And--Yeah?
What--what do you do there?

667
00:31:14,705 --> 00:31:16,398
I sit in a cubicle...

668
00:31:16,498 --> 00:31:19,460
and I update bank software
for the 2000 switch.

669
00:31:20,878 --> 00:31:21,987
What's that?

670
00:31:22,087 --> 00:31:24,240
PETER: Well, see, they wrote
all this bank software...

671
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:26,242
and, uh, to save space...

672
00:31:26,342 --> 00:31:28,077
they used two digits
for the date instead of four.

673
00:31:28,177 --> 00:31:31,080
So like 98 instead of 1998.

674
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:34,333
Uh, so I go through these
thousands of lines of code...

675
00:31:34,433 --> 00:31:37,211
and, uh...
It doesn't really matter.

676
00:31:37,311 --> 00:31:40,172
I, uh, I don't like my job,
and, uh...

677
00:31:40,272 --> 00:31:42,566
I don't think I'm gonna go
anymore.

678
00:31:43,817 --> 00:31:45,052
You're just not gonna go?

679
00:31:45,152 --> 00:31:46,303
PETER: Yeah.

680
00:31:46,403 --> 00:31:47,571
Won't you get fired?

681
00:31:48,531 --> 00:31:49,682
I don't know.

682
00:31:49,782 --> 00:31:53,577
But I really don't like it,
and, uh, I'm not gonna go.

683
00:31:54,745 --> 00:31:55,813
So you're gonna quit?

684
00:31:55,913 --> 00:31:59,024
Nah-uh. Not really. Uh...

685
00:31:59,124 --> 00:32:00,709
I'm just gonna stop going.

686
00:32:02,962 --> 00:32:04,029
PETER: What?

687
00:32:04,129 --> 00:32:06,157
Uh, when did you decide
all that?

688
00:32:06,257 --> 00:32:07,324
PETER: About an hour ago.

689
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:08,826
-Oh, really?
-Yeah.

690
00:32:08,926 --> 00:32:10,094
JOANNA: An hour ago.

691
00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:12,955
So you're gonna get another job?

692
00:32:13,055 --> 00:32:15,166
I don't think I'd like
another job.

693
00:32:15,266 --> 00:32:19,128
Well, what are you going to do
about money and bills and--

694
00:32:19,228 --> 00:32:21,714
You know, I've never
really liked paying bills.

695
00:32:21,814 --> 00:32:23,274
I don't think
I'm gonna do that, either.

696
00:32:25,359 --> 00:32:26,469
Ahh...

697
00:32:26,569 --> 00:32:28,637
well, so what do you want to do?

698
00:32:28,737 --> 00:32:30,681
I want to take you
out to dinner...

699
00:32:30,781 --> 00:32:33,058
and then I want to go back to my
apartment and watch "Kung Fu."

700
00:32:33,158 --> 00:32:34,451
Do you ever watch "Kung Fu"?

701
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:38,314
I love "Kung Fu."

702
00:32:38,414 --> 00:32:40,649
-Channel 39.
-Totally.

703
00:32:40,749 --> 00:32:42,485
PETER: You should come over
and watch "Kung Fu" tonight.

704
00:32:42,585 --> 00:32:44,487
-OK.
-Great.

705
00:32:44,587 --> 00:32:46,739
OK. Can we order lunch first?

706
00:32:46,839 --> 00:32:48,382
-Yeah.
-OK.

707
00:32:48,549 --> 00:32:52,511
[Mumbles]

708
00:32:55,931 --> 00:32:57,766
[Inaudible conversation]

709
00:33:03,772 --> 00:33:06,066
BILL:
Took a stapler off my desk...

710
00:33:09,945 --> 00:33:12,556
[Laughter]

711
00:33:12,656 --> 00:33:15,367
BILL: Anyway, sounds great, Bob.
See you in a few.

712
00:33:18,037 --> 00:33:20,581
Hi, Milton. What's happening?

713
00:33:20,706 --> 00:33:22,149
MILTON: Nothing.

714
00:33:22,249 --> 00:33:24,151
BILL: I'm going to have
to ask you to go ahead...

715
00:33:24,251 --> 00:33:26,487
and move your desk
again, so...

716
00:33:26,587 --> 00:33:29,323
if you could go ahead
and get it as far back...

717
00:33:29,423 --> 00:33:31,242
against that wall as possible...

718
00:33:31,342 --> 00:33:32,576
that would be great.

719
00:33:32,676 --> 00:33:34,161
MILTON: No, because I was--

720
00:33:34,261 --> 00:33:35,704
BILL: That way,
we'll have some room...

721
00:33:35,804 --> 00:33:37,581
for some of these boxes
and things...

722
00:33:37,681 --> 00:33:40,793
we need to put in here,
and, uh...

723
00:33:40,893 --> 00:33:44,296
Oh. Oh, there it is.

724
00:33:44,396 --> 00:33:47,091
Here, let me just go ahead
and get that from you.

725
00:33:47,191 --> 00:33:49,135
[Milton moans]

726
00:33:49,235 --> 00:33:50,528
Great.

727
00:33:51,695 --> 00:33:54,932
So if you could just get to that
as soon as possible...

728
00:33:55,032 --> 00:33:57,768
that would be terrific, OK?

729
00:33:57,868 --> 00:34:00,563
Thanks a bunch, Milton.
Good-bye.

730
00:34:00,663 --> 00:34:02,873
[Mumbles] OK.

731
00:34:03,874 --> 00:34:06,335
I could set the building
on fire.

732
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:11,574
-Peter.
-Michael.

733
00:34:11,674 --> 00:34:12,742
What the hell's going on, man?

734
00:34:12,842 --> 00:34:14,618
I thought you'd come in here
and start shooting.

735
00:34:14,718 --> 00:34:16,787
No. I just came to get
my address book.

736
00:34:16,887 --> 00:34:17,997
I'm not gonna stay.

737
00:34:18,097 --> 00:34:20,374
I got a phone number,
Mike, that I don't wanna lose.

738
00:34:20,474 --> 00:34:22,168
MICHAEL: What?
Peter, you're in deep shit.

739
00:34:22,268 --> 00:34:24,270
You were supposed to come in
Saturday. What were you doing?

740
00:34:25,145 --> 00:34:27,923
PETER: Michael, I did nothing.

741
00:34:28,023 --> 00:34:29,467
I did absolutely nothing...

742
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:32,470
and it was everything
that I thought it could be.

743
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:35,181
MICHAEL: I hope you have
a better story for Lumbergh.

744
00:34:35,281 --> 00:34:37,808
You're supposed to be at your
interview with the consultants.

745
00:34:37,908 --> 00:34:39,059
PETER: The who?

746
00:34:39,159 --> 00:34:41,495
MICHAEL: The consultants.
What has gotten into you?

747
00:34:43,455 --> 00:34:46,709
PETER: Oh, yeah...right.

748
00:34:47,668 --> 00:34:50,488
MICHAEL: Wait, Peter.
You gotta postpone it, man.

749
00:34:50,588 --> 00:34:51,614
Tell 'em you've been sick.
Make something up.

750
00:34:51,714 --> 00:34:53,866
Oh, no way. No, I feel great.

751
00:34:53,966 --> 00:34:55,801
It's the best day of my life.

752
00:34:58,053 --> 00:35:00,372
SLYDELL: Next batter
looks like a Peter Gibbons.

753
00:35:00,472 --> 00:35:01,582
PORTER: Uh-huh.

754
00:35:01,682 --> 00:35:03,876
SLYDELL: Ah, there you are.
We were just talking about you.

755
00:35:03,976 --> 00:35:05,586
You must be Peter Gibbons.

756
00:35:05,686 --> 00:35:07,004
Uh-huh. Terrific.

757
00:35:07,104 --> 00:35:09,465
I'm Bob Slydell. This is
my associate Bob Porter.

758
00:35:09,565 --> 00:35:11,008
PETER: Oh, hi, Bob. Bob.

759
00:35:11,108 --> 00:35:13,611
SLYDELL: Grab a seat
and join us for a minute or two.

760
00:35:15,154 --> 00:35:16,847
You see, what we're
actually trying to do here...

761
00:35:16,947 --> 00:35:19,850
is we're just,
we're trying to get a feel...

762
00:35:19,950 --> 00:35:21,811
for how people spend their day
at work.

763
00:35:21,911 --> 00:35:23,562
So if you would...

764
00:35:23,662 --> 00:35:27,249
would you walk us through
a typical day for you?

765
00:35:28,417 --> 00:35:30,653
-Yeah.
-Great.

766
00:35:30,753 --> 00:35:34,198
PETER: Well, I generally come in
at least fifteen minutes late.

767
00:35:34,298 --> 00:35:36,700
Uh, I use the side door.

768
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:39,745
That way Lumbergh can't see me.

769
00:35:39,845 --> 00:35:43,749
And after that, I just sort of
space out for about an hour.

770
00:35:43,849 --> 00:35:46,335
PORTER: Uh, "space out"?

771
00:35:46,435 --> 00:35:47,503
PETER: Yeah.

772
00:35:47,603 --> 00:35:49,422
I just stare at my desk.

773
00:35:49,522 --> 00:35:50,965
But it looks like I'm working.

774
00:35:51,065 --> 00:35:54,844
I do that for probably
another hour after lunch, too.

775
00:35:54,944 --> 00:35:56,720
I'd say in a given week...

776
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:58,639
I probably only do
about fifteen minutes...

777
00:35:58,739 --> 00:36:01,617
of real, actual work.

778
00:36:03,077 --> 00:36:06,313
SLYDELL: Peter,
would you be a good sport...

779
00:36:06,413 --> 00:36:08,357
and indulge us and just...

780
00:36:08,457 --> 00:36:09,442
tell us a little more?

781
00:36:09,542 --> 00:36:11,026
Oh, yeah.

782
00:36:11,126 --> 00:36:14,739
Let me tell you something
about T.P.S. reports.

783
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:15,948
Ahh...

784
00:36:16,048 --> 00:36:19,410
The thing is, Bob,
it's not that I'm lazy.

785
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:21,495
It's that I just don't care.

786
00:36:21,595 --> 00:36:23,748
PORTER: Don't...don't care?

787
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:26,333
It's a problem of motivation,
all right?

788
00:36:26,433 --> 00:36:28,002
Now, if I work my ass off...

789
00:36:28,102 --> 00:36:29,920
and lnitech
ships a few extra units...

790
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:31,839
I don't see another dime.

791
00:36:31,939 --> 00:36:33,524
So where's the motivation?

792
00:36:34,316 --> 00:36:36,177
And here's something else,
Bob...

793
00:36:36,277 --> 00:36:38,179
I have eight different bosses
right now.

794
00:36:38,279 --> 00:36:39,346
-I beg your pardon?
-Eight bosses.

795
00:36:39,446 --> 00:36:40,514
-Eight?
-Eight, Bob.

796
00:36:40,614 --> 00:36:43,309
So that means that
when I make a mistake...

797
00:36:43,409 --> 00:36:47,021
I have eight different people
coming by to tell me about it.

798
00:36:47,121 --> 00:36:50,399
That's my only real motivation,
is not to be hassled.

799
00:36:50,499 --> 00:36:51,692
That and the fear
of losing my job.

800
00:36:51,792 --> 00:36:53,611
But you know, Bob...

801
00:36:53,711 --> 00:36:55,321
that'll only make someone
work just hard enough...

802
00:36:55,421 --> 00:36:56,589
not to get fired.

803
00:36:57,256 --> 00:37:00,201
SLYDELL: Would you bear with me
for just a second, please?

804
00:37:00,301 --> 00:37:01,594
PETER: OK.

805
00:37:02,803 --> 00:37:04,538
SLYDELL: What if--
and believe me...

806
00:37:04,638 --> 00:37:07,583
this is strictly hypothetical--

807
00:37:07,683 --> 00:37:11,670
but what if you were offered
some kind of a stock option...

808
00:37:11,770 --> 00:37:13,422
equity-sharing program?

809
00:37:13,522 --> 00:37:14,799
Would that do anything for you?

810
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:17,093
I don't know. I guess.
Listen, I'm gonna go.

811
00:37:17,193 --> 00:37:20,137
Uh, it's been really nice
talking to both of you guys.

812
00:37:20,237 --> 00:37:21,472
-Yes.
-Absolutely.

813
00:37:21,572 --> 00:37:24,141
SLYDELL: Pleasure's all on this
side of the table, trust me.

814
00:37:24,241 --> 00:37:25,768
Good luck
with your layoffs, all right?

815
00:37:25,868 --> 00:37:27,603
I hope your firings
go really well.

816
00:37:27,703 --> 00:37:28,854
-OK.
-Thanks a lot.

817
00:37:28,954 --> 00:37:30,706
SLYDELL: Great. Wow.

818
00:37:38,339 --> 00:37:40,658
BILL:
So, Peter, what's happening?

819
00:37:40,758 --> 00:37:42,134
Listen, uh...

820
00:37:49,517 --> 00:37:51,836
STAN: Joanna, would you
come here a minute, please?

821
00:37:51,936 --> 00:37:53,796
JOANNA: Yeah.

822
00:37:53,896 --> 00:37:58,050
I'm sorry I was late, but I
was having lunch, and l, uh...

823
00:37:58,150 --> 00:37:59,735
STAN: We need to talk about
your flair.

824
00:38:00,653 --> 00:38:03,431
JOANNA: Really?
l--I have fifteen pieces on.

825
00:38:03,531 --> 00:38:04,974
I also...

826
00:38:05,074 --> 00:38:08,227
STAN: Well, fifteen
is the minimum, OK?

827
00:38:08,327 --> 00:38:09,395
JOANNA: Oh. OK.

828
00:38:09,495 --> 00:38:11,397
STAN: Now, you know,
it's up to you whether or not...

829
00:38:11,497 --> 00:38:14,358
you want to just
do the bare minimum or...

830
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:15,609
Well, like Brian, for example...

831
00:38:15,709 --> 00:38:19,071
has thirty-seven pieces of flair
on today.

832
00:38:19,171 --> 00:38:20,489
And a terrific smile.

833
00:38:20,589 --> 00:38:22,883
OK, so you want me to wear more?

834
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:25,578
Look, Joanna...

835
00:38:25,678 --> 00:38:26,746
Yeah?

836
00:38:26,846 --> 00:38:28,664
People can get
a cheeseburger anywhere, OK?

837
00:38:28,764 --> 00:38:31,892
They come to Chotchkie's for
the atmosphere and the attitude.

838
00:38:32,685 --> 00:38:34,003
OK? that's what
the flair's about.

839
00:38:34,103 --> 00:38:35,713
-It's about fun.
-Yeah.

840
00:38:35,813 --> 00:38:37,982
OK, so more then, yeah?

841
00:38:39,775 --> 00:38:42,928
Look, we want you
to express yourself, OK?

842
00:38:43,028 --> 00:38:47,433
Now if you feel that the bare
minimum is enough, then, OK...

843
00:38:47,533 --> 00:38:50,352
but some people choose
to wear more...

844
00:38:50,452 --> 00:38:52,288
and we encourage that, OK?

845
00:38:53,622 --> 00:38:55,624
You do want to express yourself,
don't you?

846
00:38:56,750 --> 00:38:57,818
Y-yeah.

847
00:38:57,918 --> 00:39:00,321
OK, great, great.
That's all I ask.

848
00:39:00,421 --> 00:39:01,964
OK.

849
00:39:03,215 --> 00:39:05,826
SLYDELL: Right, so there's
three more people...

850
00:39:05,926 --> 00:39:07,912
we can easily lose.

851
00:39:08,012 --> 00:39:11,223
Then there's Tom Smykowski.

852
00:39:12,141 --> 00:39:13,209
He's useless.

853
00:39:13,309 --> 00:39:14,835
Gone.

854
00:39:14,935 --> 00:39:16,504
DOM: Sounds good to me.

855
00:39:16,604 --> 00:39:18,923
SLYDELL: Here's a peculiar...

856
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:21,300
-Uh, Milton Waddams.
-Who's he?

857
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:23,385
PORTER: You know, squirrelly
looking guy. Mumbles a lot.

858
00:39:23,485 --> 00:39:24,553
DOM: Oh, yeah.

859
00:39:24,653 --> 00:39:26,263
SLYDELL: We--we can't actually
find a record...

860
00:39:26,363 --> 00:39:28,641
of him being
a current employee here.

861
00:39:28,741 --> 00:39:30,559
PORTER: I looked into it
more deeply...

862
00:39:30,659 --> 00:39:32,561
and I found that
apparently what happened...

863
00:39:32,661 --> 00:39:35,356
is that he was laid off
five years ago...

864
00:39:35,456 --> 00:39:36,565
and no one ever
told him about it...

865
00:39:36,665 --> 00:39:39,110
but through some kind of glitch
in the payroll department...

866
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:40,528
he still gets a paycheck.

867
00:39:40,628 --> 00:39:43,406
So we just went ahead
and fixed the glitch.

868
00:39:43,506 --> 00:39:44,573
BILL: Great.

869
00:39:44,673 --> 00:39:47,368
DOM:
So, uh, Milton has been let go?

870
00:39:47,468 --> 00:39:48,536
SLYDELL: Just a second there,
professor.

871
00:39:48,636 --> 00:39:52,164
We, uh, we fixed the glitch.

872
00:39:52,264 --> 00:39:54,375
So he won't be receiving
a paycheck anymore.

873
00:39:54,475 --> 00:39:56,919
So it'll just work itself out
naturally.

874
00:39:57,019 --> 00:40:00,047
PORTER: We always like to avoid
confrontation whenever possible.

875
00:40:00,147 --> 00:40:01,215
The problem is solved
from your end.

876
00:40:01,315 --> 00:40:02,383
[Laughter]

877
00:40:02,483 --> 00:40:05,928
SLYDELL: I'd like to move us
right along to a Peter Gibbons.

878
00:40:06,028 --> 00:40:08,556
Now, we had a chance
to meet this young man...

879
00:40:08,656 --> 00:40:11,225
and, boy, that's just
a straight shooter...

880
00:40:11,325 --> 00:40:13,018
with upper management
written all over him.

881
00:40:13,118 --> 00:40:15,479
Eech. Ooh.

882
00:40:15,579 --> 00:40:18,816
Yeah. Um...

883
00:40:18,916 --> 00:40:20,151
I'm going to have to go ahead...

884
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:22,403
and sort of disagree
with you there.

885
00:40:22,503 --> 00:40:25,030
Yeah, uh, he's been
real flaky lately...

886
00:40:25,130 --> 00:40:28,868
and I'm just not sure
that he's the caliber person...

887
00:40:28,968 --> 00:40:31,203
that we would want
for upper management.

888
00:40:31,303 --> 00:40:33,956
He's also been having
some problems...

889
00:40:34,056 --> 00:40:35,933
with his T.P.S. reports.

890
00:40:37,059 --> 00:40:38,919
PORTER: I'll handle this.

891
00:40:39,019 --> 00:40:42,047
We feel...

892
00:40:42,147 --> 00:40:44,216
that the problem
isn't with Peter.

893
00:40:44,316 --> 00:40:46,051
SLYDELL: Mm-mmm.

894
00:40:46,151 --> 00:40:48,220
PORTER: It's that you haven't
challenged him enough...

895
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:49,388
to get him really motivated.

896
00:40:49,488 --> 00:40:50,656
SLYDELL: There it is.

897
00:40:52,074 --> 00:40:54,560
Yeah...Ah, well...

898
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:56,896
I'm just not sure about that
right now.

899
00:40:56,996 --> 00:40:59,690
SLYDELL: Yeah, Bill, let me ask
you a real quick question here.

900
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:02,985
How much time would you say
you spend each week...

901
00:41:03,085 --> 00:41:05,087
dealing with
these T.P.S. reports?

902
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:11,468
Yeah...

903
00:41:20,019 --> 00:41:22,479
GETO BOYS RAPPING: Damn,
it feels good to be a gangsta

904
00:41:32,948 --> 00:41:34,725
Damn, it feels good
to be a gangsta

905
00:41:34,825 --> 00:41:37,394
A real gangsta ass nigger
plays his cards right

906
00:41:37,494 --> 00:41:40,022
A real gangsta ass nigger
never runs his mouth

907
00:41:40,122 --> 00:41:43,109
'Cause real gangsta ass
niggers don't start fights

908
00:41:43,209 --> 00:41:45,653
And niggers always
gotta hide here

909
00:41:45,753 --> 00:41:48,531
Showin' all his boys
how we shot 'em

910
00:41:48,631 --> 00:41:50,825
Real gangsta ass niggers
don't flex nuts

911
00:41:50,925 --> 00:41:53,594
'Cause real gangsta ass
niggers know they got 'em

912
00:41:54,345 --> 00:41:56,622
And everything is cool
in the mind of a gangsta

913
00:41:56,722 --> 00:41:59,083
'Cause gangsta ass niggers
think deep

914
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:01,961
Up three-sixty-five
and twenty-four-seven

915
00:42:02,061 --> 00:42:04,547
Real gangsta ass niggers
don't sleep

916
00:42:04,647 --> 00:42:07,591
And all I gotta say
to you wannabe, gonna-be

917
00:42:07,691 --> 00:42:10,152
cootchie-eatin',
jealous-hearted pranksters...

918
00:42:10,819 --> 00:42:12,363
[Alarm blaring]

919
00:42:13,239 --> 00:42:16,033
Damn, it feels good
to be a gangsta

920
00:42:18,911 --> 00:42:20,104
LAWRENCE: Hey, Peter, man!

921
00:42:20,204 --> 00:42:23,707
Check out channel nine.
It's the breast exams. Whoo!

922
00:42:37,555 --> 00:42:39,498
GETO BOYS RAPPING: Damn,
it feels good to be a gangsta

923
00:42:39,598 --> 00:42:40,833
DOM: Hi, Peter.

924
00:42:40,933 --> 00:42:42,668
PETER: Oh, hi, Dom.

925
00:42:42,768 --> 00:42:45,212
GETO BOYS RAPPING:
Although I was born in Jamaica

926
00:42:45,312 --> 00:42:47,965
Now I'm in the U.S. making deals

927
00:42:48,065 --> 00:42:50,676
Damn, it feels good
to be a gangsta

928
00:42:50,776 --> 00:42:53,028
I mean,
one that you don't really know

929
00:42:53,779 --> 00:42:55,973
Riding around town
in a drop top Benz

930
00:42:56,073 --> 00:42:58,976
Hittin' switches
in my black six-four

931
00:42:59,076 --> 00:43:01,771
Now gangsta ass niggers
come in all shapes and colors

932
00:43:01,871 --> 00:43:04,190
Some got killed in the past

933
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:06,859
But this gangsta here
was a smart one

934
00:43:06,959 --> 00:43:08,861
Started living for the Lord
and not laughs

935
00:43:08,961 --> 00:43:12,615
Now all I gotta say
to you wannabe, gonna-be

936
00:43:12,715 --> 00:43:14,909
crumb snatchin',
cootchie-eatin' pranksters

937
00:43:15,009 --> 00:43:16,535
When the Grim Reaper steps up

938
00:43:16,635 --> 00:43:17,995
What the hell you gonna do?

939
00:43:18,095 --> 00:43:20,264
Damn, it feels good
to be a gangsta

940
00:43:31,108 --> 00:43:32,927
BILL: So...Peter...

941
00:43:33,027 --> 00:43:34,095
what's happening?

942
00:43:34,195 --> 00:43:37,473
Ahh, now,
are you going to go ahead...

943
00:43:37,573 --> 00:43:41,435
and have those T.P.S. reports
for us this afternoon?

944
00:43:41,535 --> 00:43:42,912
PETER: No.

945
00:43:44,163 --> 00:43:46,649
Ahh...yeah...

946
00:43:46,749 --> 00:43:48,609
So I guess we should
probably go ahead...

947
00:43:48,709 --> 00:43:51,570
and have a little talk, hmm?

948
00:43:51,670 --> 00:43:54,657
PETER: Not right now, Lumbergh,
I'm--I'm kinda busy.

949
00:43:54,757 --> 00:43:58,594
In fact, I'm going to have
to ask you to go ahead.

950
00:43:59,512 --> 00:44:00,663
Just come back another time.

951
00:44:00,763 --> 00:44:03,140
I got a meeting with the Bobs
in a couple of minutes.

952
00:44:04,183 --> 00:44:06,335
BILL: Uh, I wasn't aware
of a meeting with them.

953
00:44:06,435 --> 00:44:08,604
PETER:
Yeah, they called me at home.

954
00:44:13,442 --> 00:44:14,510
BILL: That sounds good, Peter.

955
00:44:14,610 --> 00:44:16,762
And, uh, we'll go ahead and...

956
00:44:16,862 --> 00:44:19,098
get this all fixed up for you.

957
00:44:19,198 --> 00:44:20,266
Great.

958
00:44:20,366 --> 00:44:22,868
[Mumbles]

959
00:44:25,329 --> 00:44:28,023
Hi, Milton. What's happening?

960
00:44:28,123 --> 00:44:29,233
[Mumbles]

961
00:44:29,333 --> 00:44:31,610
I--I didn't receive
my paycheck this week.

962
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:36,282
Uh, you're going to have to talk
to payroll about that.

963
00:44:36,382 --> 00:44:37,616
I did and they said--

964
00:44:37,716 --> 00:44:39,535
BILL:
Milt, we're gonna go ahead...

965
00:44:39,635 --> 00:44:43,330
and move you downstairs
into storage "B."

966
00:44:43,430 --> 00:44:45,082
No, l--I...

967
00:44:45,182 --> 00:44:49,128
BILL: New people are coming,
and we need the space.

968
00:44:49,228 --> 00:44:50,504
MILTON: But there's no space--

969
00:44:50,604 --> 00:44:54,133
BILL: So if you could go ahead
and pack your stuff...

970
00:44:54,233 --> 00:44:55,926
and move it down there...

971
00:44:56,026 --> 00:44:57,970
that would be terrific.

972
00:44:58,070 --> 00:44:59,388
OK?

973
00:44:59,488 --> 00:45:01,474
MILTON: Uh, excuse me...

974
00:45:01,574 --> 00:45:07,104
I believe you have my stapler,
please. Hmm.

975
00:45:07,204 --> 00:45:09,440
PORTER: You've been missing
a lot of work lately.

976
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:11,709
PETER: I wouldn't say
I've been missing it, Bob.

977
00:45:13,169 --> 00:45:14,403
PORTER: Good one.

978
00:45:14,503 --> 00:45:16,280
SLYDELL:
Oh, that's terrific, Peter.

979
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:19,492
I'm sure you've--you've heard
some of the rumors...

980
00:45:19,592 --> 00:45:21,285
circulating
around the hallways...

981
00:45:21,385 --> 00:45:24,163
about how we're going to do
a little "housecleaning..."

982
00:45:24,263 --> 00:45:25,456
with some software people.

983
00:45:25,556 --> 00:45:28,709
Well, Bob, I have heard that.
You gotta do what you gotta do.

984
00:45:28,809 --> 00:45:30,795
PORTER: We'll be getting rid
of these people.

985
00:45:30,895 --> 00:45:35,674
First, Mr. Samir Naga...

986
00:45:35,774 --> 00:45:36,926
SLYDELL: Naga...

987
00:45:37,026 --> 00:45:40,221
PORTER: Naga-gonna work here
anymore, anyway.

988
00:45:40,321 --> 00:45:43,724
And Mr. Mike Bolton.
Nobody's gonna miss him.

989
00:45:43,824 --> 00:45:45,476
You're gonna layoff
Samir and Michael?

990
00:45:45,576 --> 00:45:48,062
PORTER: Yeah. We're gonna bring
in some entry-level graduates.

991
00:45:48,162 --> 00:45:50,314
Farm some work out to Singapore,
that's the usual deal.

992
00:45:50,414 --> 00:45:51,649
SLYDELL: It's standard
operating procedure.

993
00:45:51,749 --> 00:45:53,901
PETER: Do they know this yet?

994
00:45:54,001 --> 00:45:56,153
SLYDELL: No. No, of course not.

995
00:45:56,253 --> 00:45:59,031
We find it's always better
to fire people on a Friday.

996
00:45:59,131 --> 00:46:01,325
Studies have
statistically shown...

997
00:46:01,425 --> 00:46:02,993
there's less chance
of an incident...

998
00:46:03,093 --> 00:46:04,745
if you do it at the end
of the week.

999
00:46:04,845 --> 00:46:07,957
Peter, what we'd like to do
is put you into position...

1000
00:46:08,057 --> 00:46:11,710
to have as many
as four people...

1001
00:46:11,810 --> 00:46:13,045
working right underneath you.

1002
00:46:13,145 --> 00:46:15,256
This is a big promotion, Pete.

1003
00:46:15,356 --> 00:46:18,008
So you're going
to fire Michael and Samir...

1004
00:46:18,108 --> 00:46:19,902
and give me more money?

1005
00:46:21,904 --> 00:46:23,556
SLYDELL: Uh-huh.

1006
00:46:23,656 --> 00:46:25,891
Wow!

1007
00:46:25,991 --> 00:46:28,894
MICHAEL: Hmm. Yeah.

1008
00:46:28,994 --> 00:46:31,772
That's it.
That's exactly what I need.

1009
00:46:31,872 --> 00:46:33,149
Give it to me.

1010
00:46:33,249 --> 00:46:34,692
Come on, you little fucker,
let's go.

1011
00:46:34,792 --> 00:46:36,318
That's what I need.
Let's do that.

1012
00:46:36,418 --> 00:46:38,904
Let's do exactly that,
you little fuck--

1013
00:46:39,004 --> 00:46:40,823
-Michael.
-Hey.

1014
00:46:40,923 --> 00:46:42,299
PETER: Listen to me.

1015
00:46:44,802 --> 00:46:46,387
What are you doing tonight?

1016
00:46:47,972 --> 00:46:50,791
PETER: Michael, there comes
a point in a man's life...

1017
00:46:50,891 --> 00:46:53,435
and maybe that time for you
is now...

1018
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:58,174
when it doesn't hurt to start
thinking about the future.

1019
00:46:58,274 --> 00:47:00,301
Uh, no offense there, Peter...

1020
00:47:00,401 --> 00:47:02,052
but speak for yourself there,
sport.

1021
00:47:02,152 --> 00:47:05,389
I'm not the one who's been
flakin' out at work.

1022
00:47:05,489 --> 00:47:09,477
I know you had this religious
experience or whatever...

1023
00:47:09,577 --> 00:47:12,329
but get your shit together,
or you're gonna get canned.

1024
00:47:13,330 --> 00:47:15,833
Yeah, and, uh, and l--Listen...

1025
00:47:16,834 --> 00:47:18,611
That virus
you're always talking about...

1026
00:47:18,711 --> 00:47:20,821
the one that could
rip off the company...

1027
00:47:20,921 --> 00:47:22,323
for a bunch of money.

1028
00:47:22,423 --> 00:47:23,657
Yeah, what about it?

1029
00:47:23,757 --> 00:47:25,426
Well, how does it work?

1030
00:47:26,218 --> 00:47:27,578
It's pretty brilliant.

1031
00:47:27,678 --> 00:47:29,747
What it does is every time
there's a bank transaction...

1032
00:47:29,847 --> 00:47:32,291
where interest is computed--
there are thousands a day--

1033
00:47:32,391 --> 00:47:34,335
the computer ends up with
these fractions of a cent...

1034
00:47:34,435 --> 00:47:35,920
which it usually rounds off.

1035
00:47:36,020 --> 00:47:38,339
What this does is it takes
those little remainders...

1036
00:47:38,439 --> 00:47:40,341
and puts it into an account.

1037
00:47:40,441 --> 00:47:43,094
-This sounds familiar.
-They did it in "Superman Ill."

1038
00:47:43,194 --> 00:47:44,345
PETER: Right, uh...

1039
00:47:44,445 --> 00:47:46,097
MICHAEL:
An underrated movie, actually.

1040
00:47:46,197 --> 00:47:49,558
There were hackers that did it
in the seventies as well.

1041
00:47:49,658 --> 00:47:52,645
-So they check for this now.
-No, here's the thing.

1042
00:47:52,745 --> 00:47:55,981
Initech's so backed up with all
the software we're updating...

1043
00:47:56,081 --> 00:47:57,191
they'd never notice.

1044
00:47:57,291 --> 00:47:59,276
You're right.

1045
00:47:59,376 --> 00:48:01,695
Even if they wanted to, they
couldn't check all that code.

1046
00:48:01,795 --> 00:48:04,698
MICHAEL: Thumbs up their asses.
Thumbs up their asses.

1047
00:48:04,798 --> 00:48:08,702
PETER: So, Michael, what's
to stop you from doing this?

1048
00:48:08,802 --> 00:48:11,347
It's not worth the risk.
I got a good job.

1049
00:48:12,556 --> 00:48:15,059
What if you didn't have
a good job?

1050
00:48:16,477 --> 00:48:17,728
MICHAEL: Cock gobblers!

1051
00:48:21,398 --> 00:48:25,094
Samir and I are
the best programmers they got.

1052
00:48:25,194 --> 00:48:27,346
You haven't been showin' up,
and you get to keep your job.

1053
00:48:27,446 --> 00:48:29,265
Actually, I'm being promoted.

1054
00:48:29,365 --> 00:48:31,976
-What?!
-I know, Michael.

1055
00:48:32,076 --> 00:48:34,562
It's completely unfair.

1056
00:48:34,662 --> 00:48:37,148
And I realized something today.

1057
00:48:37,248 --> 00:48:40,151
It's not just about me
and my dream of doing nothing.

1058
00:48:40,251 --> 00:48:42,211
It's about all of us together.

1059
00:48:43,879 --> 00:48:47,199
I don't know what happened to me
at that hypnotherapist.

1060
00:48:47,299 --> 00:48:49,785
Maybe it was just shock,
and it's wearing off now...

1061
00:48:49,885 --> 00:48:52,538
but when I saw that fat man
keel over and die...

1062
00:48:52,638 --> 00:48:55,583
Michael, we don't have
a lot of time on this earth.

1063
00:48:55,683 --> 00:48:58,586
We weren't meant to spend it
this way.

1064
00:48:58,686 --> 00:49:01,881
Human beings were not meant
to sit in little cubicles...

1065
00:49:01,981 --> 00:49:03,883
staring at computer screens
all day...

1066
00:49:03,983 --> 00:49:05,092
filling out useless forms...

1067
00:49:05,192 --> 00:49:06,802
and listening
to eight different bosses...

1068
00:49:06,902 --> 00:49:09,346
drone on
about mission statements.

1069
00:49:09,446 --> 00:49:12,308
I told those fudgepackers
I liked Michael Bolton's music.

1070
00:49:12,408 --> 00:49:16,061
Ohh. That is not right, Michael.

1071
00:49:16,161 --> 00:49:18,981
For five years now,
you've worked your ass off...

1072
00:49:19,081 --> 00:49:23,110
hoping for a promotion,
profit sharing, or something.

1073
00:49:23,210 --> 00:49:24,570
Five years...

1074
00:49:24,670 --> 00:49:27,406
of your mid-twenties now gone.

1075
00:49:27,506 --> 00:49:28,741
And you're gonna
go in tomorrow...

1076
00:49:28,841 --> 00:49:31,452
they're gonna throw you
out on the street.

1077
00:49:31,552 --> 00:49:33,287
You know why?

1078
00:49:33,387 --> 00:49:37,750
So Bill Lumbergh's stock
will go up a quarter of a point.

1079
00:49:37,850 --> 00:49:39,460
Ugh.

1080
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:41,629
Michael, let's make
that stock go down...

1081
00:49:41,729 --> 00:49:43,672
and let's take enough money
out of that place...

1082
00:49:43,772 --> 00:49:47,067
so that we never have
to sit in a cubicle ever again.

1083
00:49:48,485 --> 00:49:50,429
Your software works, right?

1084
00:49:50,529 --> 00:49:52,239
Of course it works.
That's not the point.

1085
00:49:53,699 --> 00:49:55,726
Even if I wanted to, I wouldn't
know how to install it.

1086
00:49:55,826 --> 00:49:58,354
I don't know the credit union's
software well enough. OK?

1087
00:49:58,454 --> 00:50:02,166
Yeah. But Samir does.

1088
00:50:02,291 --> 00:50:03,609
SAMIR:
But that's not much money.

1089
00:50:03,709 --> 00:50:04,902
PETER: That's the beauty of it.

1090
00:50:05,002 --> 00:50:09,031
Each withdrawal, it's a fraction
of a cent, too small to notice.

1091
00:50:09,131 --> 00:50:11,325
But you take a few thousand
withdrawals a day...

1092
00:50:11,425 --> 00:50:12,827
you space it out
over a couple of years...

1093
00:50:12,927 --> 00:50:15,162
that's a few
hundred thousand dollars.

1094
00:50:15,262 --> 00:50:16,455
It's like "Superman Ill."

1095
00:50:16,555 --> 00:50:18,582
SAMIR: "Superman Ill"?

1096
00:50:18,682 --> 00:50:22,336
I have to leave now.
I have to get my rsum ready.

1097
00:50:22,436 --> 00:50:26,632
PETER: For another job where
they can fire you for no reason?

1098
00:50:26,732 --> 00:50:29,385
SAMIR:
That's right. If I'm lucky.

1099
00:50:29,485 --> 00:50:33,597
I'm tired of being
pushed around. Aren't you?

1100
00:50:33,697 --> 00:50:36,434
Yes, but I'm not going to do
anything illegal.

1101
00:50:36,534 --> 00:50:38,936
Illegal?
Samir, this is America.

1102
00:50:39,036 --> 00:50:41,080
Come on. Sit down.

1103
00:50:42,039 --> 00:50:44,233
Come on. This isn't Riyadh.

1104
00:50:44,333 --> 00:50:47,236
They're not going
to saw your hands off here.

1105
00:50:47,336 --> 00:50:49,697
The worst they'd do is put you
for a couple of months...

1106
00:50:49,797 --> 00:50:53,117
into a white-collar,
minimum-security resort.

1107
00:50:53,217 --> 00:50:56,871
Shit, we should be so lucky.
They have conjugal visits there.

1108
00:50:56,971 --> 00:50:58,581
-Really?
-Yes.

1109
00:50:58,681 --> 00:50:59,957
MICHAEL: Shit!

1110
00:51:00,057 --> 00:51:02,752
I'm a free man. I haven't had
a conjugal visit in six months.

1111
00:51:02,852 --> 00:51:04,587
So what do you think?

1112
00:51:04,687 --> 00:51:07,173
This thing is actually
pretty fail-safe, Samir.

1113
00:51:07,273 --> 00:51:08,440
PETER: Samir?

1114
00:51:10,192 --> 00:51:12,928
You came here looking
for a land of opportunity.

1115
00:51:13,028 --> 00:51:16,140
And this is the knock
of that opportunity.

1116
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:18,559
Tomorrow is your last day
at lnitech.

1117
00:51:18,659 --> 00:51:20,144
You have two options--

1118
00:51:20,244 --> 00:51:22,646
unemployment
or early retirement.

1119
00:51:22,746 --> 00:51:24,290
What's it gonna be?

1120
00:51:25,082 --> 00:51:26,692
-I have a question.
-Yes?

1121
00:51:26,792 --> 00:51:30,488
In this conjugal visits,
you can have sex with women?

1122
00:51:30,588 --> 00:51:33,257
Yep, you sure can.

1123
00:51:36,802 --> 00:51:37,995
OK, I'll do it.

1124
00:51:38,095 --> 00:51:40,956
PETER: That's what I'm talkin'
about when I talk about America!

1125
00:51:41,056 --> 00:51:42,374
Can we discuss the plan?

1126
00:51:42,474 --> 00:51:44,168
OK, yeah, good, right.

1127
00:51:44,268 --> 00:51:45,711
It works like a computer virus.

1128
00:51:45,811 --> 00:51:48,380
All we do is load it into
the credit union's mainframe.

1129
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:49,632
It'll do the rest.

1130
00:51:49,732 --> 00:51:52,051
PETER: Get me that disk,
and I'll take it from there.

1131
00:51:52,151 --> 00:51:54,970
Before we go any further,
all right?

1132
00:51:55,070 --> 00:51:57,515
We have to swear to God,
Allah...

1133
00:51:57,615 --> 00:52:00,101
that nobody knows about this
but us, all right?

1134
00:52:00,201 --> 00:52:03,229
No family members,
no girlfriends. Nobody.

1135
00:52:03,329 --> 00:52:04,522
-Of course.
-Agreed.

1136
00:52:04,622 --> 00:52:06,774
LAWRENCE: Don't worry, man!
I won't tell anyone, either.

1137
00:52:06,874 --> 00:52:09,026
-What the fuck is that?
-Don't worry. He's cool.

1138
00:52:09,126 --> 00:52:12,530
PETER: All right. Here's how
I see it all going down.

1139
00:52:12,630 --> 00:52:15,449
SLYDELL: Peter, congratulations.
This is one heck of a promotion.

1140
00:52:15,549 --> 00:52:16,742
PETER: Thank you, Bob.

1141
00:52:16,842 --> 00:52:19,094
PORTER: We'll get some people
under you right away.

1142
00:52:25,601 --> 00:52:26,752
ICE CUBE RAPPING:
I got something for your mind

1143
00:52:26,852 --> 00:52:28,521
Your body and your soul

1144
00:52:31,982 --> 00:52:33,259
I got something for your mind

1145
00:52:33,359 --> 00:52:34,902
Your body and your soul

1146
00:52:37,821 --> 00:52:39,156
[Bang bang]

1147
00:52:41,158 --> 00:52:45,062
ICE CUBE RAPPING: Here comes
the big-headed naked ass dippin'

1148
00:52:45,162 --> 00:52:47,314
Sippin' on Crevassier

1149
00:52:47,414 --> 00:52:50,401
Goddamn,
I must have the floss today

1150
00:52:50,501 --> 00:52:52,027
Now, pimpin' ain't easy

1151
00:52:52,127 --> 00:52:53,612
But it's necessary

1152
00:52:53,712 --> 00:52:57,158
So I'm chasin' bitches
like Tom chases Jerry

1153
00:52:57,258 --> 00:52:59,744
I put the pedal to the floor

1154
00:52:59,844 --> 00:53:02,705
In my two-tone Ford Explorer

1155
00:53:02,805 --> 00:53:05,040
You know how it's done

1156
00:53:05,140 --> 00:53:06,625
Slammin', bumpin'

1157
00:53:06,725 --> 00:53:10,254
Make that somethin' jump
on the one-ten

1158
00:53:10,354 --> 00:53:12,757
She's flyin' in the Blazer

1159
00:53:12,857 --> 00:53:14,925
Like no Speed Racer

1160
00:53:15,025 --> 00:53:16,385
But I ain't gonna chase her

1161
00:53:16,485 --> 00:53:18,804
Like Racer X

1162
00:53:18,904 --> 00:53:20,681
But I won't flex

1163
00:53:20,781 --> 00:53:23,434
Till it's time to have sex

1164
00:53:23,534 --> 00:53:25,728
So when you want
to get together?

1165
00:53:25,828 --> 00:53:30,608
'Cause you know a nigger like me
is down for whatever

1166
00:53:30,708 --> 00:53:32,710
[Bang]

1167
00:53:44,847 --> 00:53:46,082
MICHAEL: That was easy.

1168
00:53:46,182 --> 00:53:48,167
Yeah, I guess it was.

1169
00:53:48,267 --> 00:53:49,894
What'd you do with the--

1170
00:53:50,019 --> 00:53:51,796
DREW: Hey, man.

1171
00:53:51,896 --> 00:53:53,547
PETER: Oh, hey, Drew.

1172
00:53:53,647 --> 00:53:55,257
You guys hear
about Tom Smykowski?

1173
00:53:55,357 --> 00:53:56,467
That he got laid off?

1174
00:53:56,567 --> 00:53:58,010
No, man, check it out.

1175
00:53:58,110 --> 00:54:00,638
Last week, after he found out
he was getting laid off...

1176
00:54:00,738 --> 00:54:04,058
he tries to kill himself by
running the car in the garage.

1177
00:54:04,158 --> 00:54:05,267
PETER: ls he dead?

1178
00:54:05,367 --> 00:54:06,894
DREW: No, man, check it out.

1179
00:54:06,994 --> 00:54:10,106
His wife comes home early
and catches him.

1180
00:54:10,206 --> 00:54:12,024
DREW: He tries to play it off
like nothing happened.

1181
00:54:12,124 --> 00:54:15,027
TOM: I was having some trouble
with the shifter here.

1182
00:54:15,127 --> 00:54:16,445
It's jammed.

1183
00:54:16,545 --> 00:54:18,989
I--I couldn't get it
into drive.

1184
00:54:19,089 --> 00:54:21,784
-I--I--I mean, reverse.
-You OK, Tom?

1185
00:54:21,884 --> 00:54:24,161
DREW:
Then as he's lookin' at her...

1186
00:54:24,261 --> 00:54:26,205
he decides he wants to live.

1187
00:54:26,305 --> 00:54:27,790
TOM: Yeah, I think I'm OK.

1188
00:54:27,890 --> 00:54:29,208
Right.

1189
00:54:29,308 --> 00:54:31,519
Seems to be working now.

1190
00:54:33,312 --> 00:54:35,005
See you later, honey.

1191
00:54:35,105 --> 00:54:36,315
Love ya.

1192
00:54:37,942 --> 00:54:41,804
DREW: But as soon as he backs
out of his driveway...Bam !

1193
00:54:41,904 --> 00:54:44,515
He gets slammed big-time
by a drunk driver.

1194
00:54:44,615 --> 00:54:46,517
-Is he OK?
-Sort of.

1195
00:54:46,617 --> 00:54:49,770
Broke both his wrists, legs,
a couple of ribs, his back...

1196
00:54:49,870 --> 00:54:52,022
but he's getting
a huge settlement out of this.

1197
00:54:52,122 --> 00:54:53,274
Like seven figures.

1198
00:54:53,374 --> 00:54:54,859
He's getting out
of the hospital tomorrow.

1199
00:54:54,959 --> 00:54:56,861
He's throwing a big party
this weekend to celebrate.

1200
00:54:56,961 --> 00:54:58,904
We're all invited.

1201
00:54:59,004 --> 00:55:01,699
I'm thinking I might take
that new chick from logistics.

1202
00:55:01,799 --> 00:55:04,243
Things go well, I might be
showing her my "Oh" face.

1203
00:55:04,343 --> 00:55:06,704
Oh, oh, oh...

1204
00:55:06,804 --> 00:55:09,832
You know what I'm talking about.
Oh.

1205
00:55:09,932 --> 00:55:12,042
Yeah. Right.

1206
00:55:12,142 --> 00:55:13,477
See you guys there.

1207
00:55:14,812 --> 00:55:18,023
MICHAEL:
Wow, our last day at lnitech.

1208
00:55:19,316 --> 00:55:21,302
SAMIR: I can't believe
they had security escort us out.

1209
00:55:21,402 --> 00:55:23,612
It's not like
we're going to steal something.

1210
00:55:25,906 --> 00:55:27,016
I stole something.

1211
00:55:27,116 --> 00:55:29,101
Oh, yeah. I guess we all did.

1212
00:55:29,201 --> 00:55:31,871
PETER:
No, I stole something else.

1213
00:55:32,913 --> 00:55:34,373
What did you steal?

1214
00:55:35,958 --> 00:55:38,252
Call it a going-away present.

1215
00:55:54,977 --> 00:55:57,588
GETO BOYS RAPPING: Back up in
your ass with the resurrection

1216
00:55:57,688 --> 00:55:59,048
Is the group
harder than an erection

1217
00:55:59,148 --> 00:56:00,883
That shows no affection

1218
00:56:00,983 --> 00:56:02,718
They want to ban us
on Capitol Hill

1219
00:56:02,818 --> 00:56:04,178
'Cause it's die, motherfuckers

1220
00:56:04,278 --> 00:56:06,097
Die, motherfuckers

1221
00:56:06,197 --> 00:56:08,224
Nothing but the ghetto

1222
00:56:08,324 --> 00:56:10,059
Taking drugs, step slow

1223
00:56:10,159 --> 00:56:11,560
Kept my head low

1224
00:56:11,660 --> 00:56:12,853
And never let go

1225
00:56:12,953 --> 00:56:14,730
'Cause if I let go,
then I'd be spineless

1226
00:56:14,830 --> 00:56:16,607
I'm going insane

1227
00:56:16,707 --> 00:56:18,025
My mind, yes,
goes out of control

1228
00:56:18,125 --> 00:56:19,860
On some subjects
motherfuckers read on

1229
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:22,613
I done the shit
that they believe in

1230
00:56:22,713 --> 00:56:24,407
I see this motherfucker's
nine smokin'

1231
00:56:24,507 --> 00:56:25,574
I seen this

1232
00:56:25,674 --> 00:56:27,284
I bet you motherfuckers
will, too

1233
00:56:27,384 --> 00:56:28,953
Because it's die, motherfucker

1234
00:56:29,053 --> 00:56:30,496
Die, motherfucker

1235
00:56:30,596 --> 00:56:32,415
Die, motherfucker,
die, motherfucker

1236
00:56:32,515 --> 00:56:35,418
Die, motherfucker,
die, motherfucker

1237
00:56:35,518 --> 00:56:38,879
Die, motherfucker,
die, motherfucker

1238
00:56:38,979 --> 00:56:41,382
Die, motherfuckers,
die, motherfuckers

1239
00:56:41,482 --> 00:56:44,427
Die, motherfucker,
die, motherfucker

1240
00:56:44,527 --> 00:56:47,179
Die, motherfuckers,
die, motherfuckers

1241
00:56:47,279 --> 00:56:49,557
Die, motherfucker,
die, motherfucker

1242
00:56:49,657 --> 00:56:51,183
I think it's something
in the water

1243
00:56:51,283 --> 00:56:53,561
I think it's something
in the water

1244
00:56:53,661 --> 00:56:55,521
So good to be free again

1245
00:56:55,621 --> 00:56:57,189
With unity for men

1246
00:56:57,289 --> 00:56:59,859
I walk around town
with a frown on my face

1247
00:56:59,959 --> 00:57:02,153
The whole world
gonna catch a murder case

1248
00:57:02,253 --> 00:57:04,488
The murder rate may decrease

1249
00:57:04,588 --> 00:57:06,532
If you're caught up
in the world while it's dying

1250
00:57:06,632 --> 00:57:08,909
I guarantee you'll fry,
'cause I am

1251
00:57:09,009 --> 00:57:11,287
On the verge of knocking
motherfuckers out

1252
00:57:11,387 --> 00:57:12,288
For no reason

1253
00:57:12,388 --> 00:57:15,374
Once I get down,
there'll be no breathin'

1254
00:57:15,474 --> 00:57:16,917
MICHAEL: Who's got my keys?

1255
00:57:17,017 --> 00:57:18,335
SAMIR: I'm driving.

1256
00:57:18,435 --> 00:57:20,129
PETER:
Everything is gonna be OK.

1257
00:57:20,229 --> 00:57:22,047
All right? OK?

1258
00:57:22,147 --> 00:57:23,716
It's fun, and it's exciting.

1259
00:57:23,816 --> 00:57:26,343
I gotta--I gotta go. All right?

1260
00:57:26,443 --> 00:57:27,595
Joanna's coming over.

1261
00:57:27,695 --> 00:57:30,848
Don't worry.
You're worrying. All right?

1262
00:57:30,948 --> 00:57:33,058
Monday morning, we're gonna
check the account balance.

1263
00:57:33,158 --> 00:57:34,226
Everything will be OK.

1264
00:57:34,326 --> 00:57:36,437
Don't miss Tom's barbecue.
I'll see you there.

1265
00:57:36,537 --> 00:57:38,230
All right? Good night!

1266
00:57:38,330 --> 00:57:41,000
[Rapping] Back up in your ass
with the resurrection

1267
00:57:43,586 --> 00:57:45,696
What were you guys
celebrating last night?

1268
00:57:45,796 --> 00:57:50,551
Oh, um...I'm not really
at liberty to talk about it.

1269
00:57:53,762 --> 00:57:55,389
I really can't.

1270
00:57:58,100 --> 00:58:01,128
So, when the subroutine
compounds the interest...

1271
00:58:01,228 --> 00:58:03,339
it uses all these
extra decimal places...

1272
00:58:03,439 --> 00:58:05,299
that just get rounded off.

1273
00:58:05,399 --> 00:58:06,926
So we simplified
the whole thing...

1274
00:58:07,026 --> 00:58:10,262
and we round 'em all down
and drop the remainder...

1275
00:58:10,362 --> 00:58:12,364
into an account that we opened.

1276
00:58:13,532 --> 00:58:14,909
So you're stealing?

1277
00:58:15,993 --> 00:58:17,770
Uh, no.
No, you don't understand.

1278
00:58:17,870 --> 00:58:21,607
It's, uh, very complicated.
It's, uh...

1279
00:58:21,707 --> 00:58:24,735
It's aggregate, so I'm talking
about fractions of a penny...

1280
00:58:24,835 --> 00:58:28,114
and, uh, over time,
they add up to a lot.

1281
00:58:28,214 --> 00:58:31,951
Oh, OK. So you're gonna make
a lot of money, right?

1282
00:58:32,051 --> 00:58:33,285
-Yeah.
-Right.

1283
00:58:33,385 --> 00:58:34,453
It's not yours?

1284
00:58:34,553 --> 00:58:36,747
Uh...well, it becomes ours.

1285
00:58:36,847 --> 00:58:38,641
How is that not stealing?

1286
00:58:41,310 --> 00:58:44,505
I don't think
I'm explaining this very well.

1287
00:58:44,605 --> 00:58:47,675
Um, the 7-Eleven, right?

1288
00:58:47,775 --> 00:58:50,010
You'd take a penny
from the tray.

1289
00:58:50,110 --> 00:58:51,345
From the crippled children?

1290
00:58:51,445 --> 00:58:52,596
No, that's the jar.

1291
00:58:52,696 --> 00:58:56,142
I'm talking about the tray--
the pennies for everybody.

1292
00:58:56,242 --> 00:58:57,601
Oh, for everybody. OK.

1293
00:58:57,701 --> 00:58:59,728
Yeah.
Well, those are whole pennies.

1294
00:58:59,828 --> 00:59:03,649
I'm just talking about
fractions of a penny, OK?

1295
00:59:03,749 --> 00:59:05,526
But we do it
from a much bigger tray...

1296
00:59:05,626 --> 00:59:07,653
and we do it
a couple of million times.

1297
00:59:07,753 --> 00:59:09,238
So what's wrong with that?

1298
00:59:09,338 --> 00:59:10,948
I don't know.
It just seems wrong.

1299
00:59:11,048 --> 00:59:12,158
PETER: It's not wrong.

1300
00:59:12,258 --> 00:59:13,451
Initech is wrong.

1301
00:59:13,551 --> 00:59:16,036
Initech is an evil corporation,
all right?

1302
00:59:16,136 --> 00:59:18,164
Chotchkie's is wrong.

1303
00:59:18,264 --> 00:59:20,166
Doesn't it bother you that you
have to get up in the morning...

1304
00:59:20,266 --> 00:59:22,293
and you have to put on
a bunch of pieces of flair?

1305
00:59:22,393 --> 00:59:24,754
Yeah, but I'm not about
to go in and start...

1306
00:59:24,854 --> 00:59:26,464
taking money from the register.

1307
00:59:26,564 --> 00:59:27,815
Well, maybe you should.

1308
00:59:29,567 --> 00:59:32,845
The Nazis had pieces of flair
that they made the Jews wear.

1309
00:59:32,945 --> 00:59:34,238
What?

1310
00:59:35,906 --> 00:59:37,558
Look, we don't...I'm--

1311
00:59:37,658 --> 00:59:39,268
We don't have
to talk about this now.

1312
00:59:39,368 --> 00:59:42,872
Let's just go to the barbecue,
all right?

1313
00:59:45,875 --> 00:59:48,569
TOM: Michael, Samir,
how you doin'?

1314
00:59:48,669 --> 00:59:49,779
-Hey, Tom.
-Hello, Tom.

1315
00:59:49,879 --> 00:59:52,948
I'd like you to meet
my lawyer Rob Newhouse.

1316
00:59:53,048 --> 00:59:55,743
Rob, Michael. Samir.

1317
00:59:55,843 --> 00:59:59,288
Peter! How are you?
I'm glad you could make it.

1318
00:59:59,388 --> 01:00:02,333
PETER: Tom, hi. This is somebody
I'd like you to meet.

1319
01:00:02,433 --> 01:00:04,293
-This is, uh, Joanna.
-Hi.

1320
01:00:04,393 --> 01:00:06,770
Hi. Forgive me
for not getting up.

1321
01:00:07,771 --> 01:00:10,232
[Laughing]

1322
01:00:13,444 --> 01:00:16,263
[Coughing]
Ooh, ooh.

1323
01:00:16,363 --> 01:00:18,782
Peter, come here a minute.
I wanna show you something.

1324
01:00:20,117 --> 01:00:22,770
Well...what do you think?
It's a prototype.

1325
01:00:22,870 --> 01:00:24,605
PETER: Huh...that's...

1326
01:00:24,705 --> 01:00:27,249
that's exactly as you
described it.

1327
01:00:29,251 --> 01:00:31,821
Uh, listen, I heard about
your--your settlement.

1328
01:00:31,921 --> 01:00:33,072
Congratulations.

1329
01:00:33,172 --> 01:00:34,281
Well, thanks, Peter.

1330
01:00:34,381 --> 01:00:38,244
You know, I'm glad you're here,
because I wanted to talk to you.

1331
01:00:38,344 --> 01:00:41,622
I know how you get depressed
about your job and all, and...

1332
01:00:41,722 --> 01:00:44,375
I just wanted you to know
that I know how you feel.

1333
01:00:44,475 --> 01:00:46,168
I used to be the same way.

1334
01:00:46,268 --> 01:00:48,212
-Really?
-Sure.

1335
01:00:48,312 --> 01:00:49,964
Maybe I didn't whine as much.

1336
01:00:50,064 --> 01:00:52,842
But I bet I hated my job
even more than you...

1337
01:00:52,942 --> 01:00:55,219
and I'd been doing it
for over thirty years.

1338
01:00:55,319 --> 01:00:56,637
Wow.

1339
01:00:56,737 --> 01:01:00,266
Just remember, if you
hang in there long enough...

1340
01:01:00,366 --> 01:01:03,519
good things can happen
in this world.

1341
01:01:03,619 --> 01:01:05,704
I mean, look at me.

1342
01:01:06,705 --> 01:01:08,123
Thanks, Tom.

1343
01:01:09,166 --> 01:01:11,026
TOM: Ah, sure.

1344
01:01:11,126 --> 01:01:12,586
[Music playing]

1345
01:01:16,465 --> 01:01:19,660
ROB: Conjugal visits?
Not that I know of.

1346
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:22,371
Minimum-security prison
is no picnic.

1347
01:01:22,471 --> 01:01:24,582
I have a client in there
right now.

1348
01:01:24,682 --> 01:01:26,292
He says the trick is...

1349
01:01:26,392 --> 01:01:28,210
kick someone's ass
the first day...

1350
01:01:28,310 --> 01:01:29,754
or become someone's bitch.

1351
01:01:29,854 --> 01:01:32,423
Then everything
will be all right.

1352
01:01:32,523 --> 01:01:34,133
Why do you ask, anyway?

1353
01:01:34,233 --> 01:01:36,469
MICHAEL: Oh, no, we just--

1354
01:01:36,569 --> 01:01:37,778
SAMIR: It's a...

1355
01:01:44,034 --> 01:01:46,061
-Hey, Peter.
-Drew.

1356
01:01:46,161 --> 01:01:48,314
That's something
about old Smykowski, huh?

1357
01:01:48,414 --> 01:01:50,207
-Yeah.
-Lucky bastard.

1358
01:01:51,375 --> 01:01:54,570
DREW: Hey, isn't that the girl
that works over at Chotchkie's?

1359
01:01:54,670 --> 01:01:56,405
PETER: Yep.

1360
01:01:56,505 --> 01:01:58,074
Who's she here with?

1361
01:01:58,174 --> 01:01:59,466
She's with me.

1362
01:02:01,302 --> 01:02:03,370
-Really?
-Yep.

1363
01:02:03,470 --> 01:02:06,891
All right, Peter.
Ooh, ooh, right on.

1364
01:02:07,933 --> 01:02:10,060
Make sure you wear a rubber,
dude.

1365
01:02:12,354 --> 01:02:13,464
Why's that, Drew?

1366
01:02:13,564 --> 01:02:15,216
Are you kidding me?

1367
01:02:15,316 --> 01:02:17,359
She gets around. All right?

1368
01:02:18,861 --> 01:02:20,846
She does, does she?

1369
01:02:20,946 --> 01:02:23,073
Oh, yeah, like a record.

1370
01:02:25,993 --> 01:02:27,394
PETER: Like with who?

1371
01:02:27,494 --> 01:02:30,397
Oh, let's see, uh...

1372
01:02:30,497 --> 01:02:32,625
Hell, Lumbergh fucked her.

1373
01:02:33,751 --> 01:02:35,461
Uh, let me see, who else?

1374
01:02:37,588 --> 01:02:38,756
Lumbergh?

1375
01:02:41,133 --> 01:02:43,452
JOANNA: What if you get caught?

1376
01:02:43,552 --> 01:02:46,789
Oh, I just don't know
if this was such a good idea.

1377
01:02:46,889 --> 01:02:49,917
Maybe it wasn't such a good idea
for you to sleep with Lumbergh.

1378
01:02:50,017 --> 01:02:51,293
What?

1379
01:02:51,393 --> 01:02:52,603
What are you--

1380
01:02:53,771 --> 01:02:55,756
Oh, right, Lumbergh.

1381
01:02:55,856 --> 01:02:57,299
Aah!

1382
01:02:57,399 --> 01:03:00,469
Oh...God...Lumbergh!

1383
01:03:00,569 --> 01:03:02,513
Peter, what is wrong with you?

1384
01:03:02,613 --> 01:03:04,306
That was, like, two years ago.

1385
01:03:04,406 --> 01:03:05,766
What? Did you know him?

1386
01:03:05,866 --> 01:03:07,435
Yeah, I know him. I know him.

1387
01:03:07,535 --> 01:03:08,811
He's my boss.

1388
01:03:08,911 --> 01:03:12,273
He's my unholy,
disgusting pig of a boss.

1389
01:03:12,373 --> 01:03:14,442
Oh, he's not that disgusting.

1390
01:03:14,542 --> 01:03:17,778
PETER: He represents all
that is soulless and wrong...

1391
01:03:17,878 --> 01:03:19,572
and you slept with him.

1392
01:03:19,672 --> 01:03:23,033
Hey, that is none
of your business, OK?

1393
01:03:23,133 --> 01:03:25,953
I didn't ask you who you slept
with before we were together.

1394
01:03:26,053 --> 01:03:27,204
I don't care.

1395
01:03:27,304 --> 01:03:29,331
I didn't think you
slept with guys like Lumbergh!

1396
01:03:29,431 --> 01:03:31,625
Listen to you.

1397
01:03:31,725 --> 01:03:33,169
Who do you think you are?

1398
01:03:33,269 --> 01:03:35,755
How dare you judge me?

1399
01:03:35,855 --> 01:03:38,632
I mean, what are you?
You think you're an angel?

1400
01:03:38,732 --> 01:03:41,427
No, you're just
this penny-stealing...

1401
01:03:41,527 --> 01:03:44,180
wannabe criminal man.

1402
01:03:44,280 --> 01:03:45,931
Yeah, well, that may be.

1403
01:03:46,031 --> 01:03:48,476
But at least I never
slept with Lumbergh.

1404
01:03:48,576 --> 01:03:49,869
OK, that's...I'm done.

1405
01:03:49,994 --> 01:03:53,105
I wanna get out of the car, OK?
Stop.

1406
01:03:53,205 --> 01:03:55,024
Call me when you grow up.

1407
01:03:55,124 --> 01:03:57,234
Wait. That's probably
never gonna happen.

1408
01:03:57,334 --> 01:03:58,527
So don't call me, OK?

1409
01:03:58,627 --> 01:04:00,838
Say hello to Lumbergh for me!

1410
01:04:07,678 --> 01:04:09,455
Hell, Lumbergh fucked her.

1411
01:04:09,555 --> 01:04:11,082
Lumbergh fucked her.

1412
01:04:11,182 --> 01:04:13,334
Lumbergh fucked her.

1413
01:04:13,434 --> 01:04:15,336
That is great.

1414
01:04:15,436 --> 01:04:18,464
I mean, she was seeing
the "Oh" face for sure.

1415
01:04:18,564 --> 01:04:22,301
Ohh, ohh, ohh.

1416
01:04:22,401 --> 01:04:23,969
Ooh.

1417
01:04:24,069 --> 01:04:26,680
If you could just move
a little bit to the left.

1418
01:04:26,780 --> 01:04:29,141
That's it. Great.

1419
01:04:29,241 --> 01:04:31,352
Peter, what's happening?

1420
01:04:31,452 --> 01:04:36,273
Um, could you give me
those T.P.S. reports ASAP, OK?

1421
01:04:36,373 --> 01:04:37,583
Oh!

1422
01:04:51,805 --> 01:04:53,390
-Joanna.
-Yeah.

1423
01:04:53,974 --> 01:04:55,751
We need to talk.

1424
01:04:55,851 --> 01:04:57,770
Do you know what this is about?

1425
01:05:01,649 --> 01:05:03,217
My, uh, flair?

1426
01:05:03,317 --> 01:05:05,428
Yeah.

1427
01:05:05,528 --> 01:05:09,306
Or your lack of flair,
because, uh...

1428
01:05:09,406 --> 01:05:11,767
I'm counting,
and I only see fifteen pieces.

1429
01:05:11,867 --> 01:05:14,145
Let me ask you a question,
Joanna.

1430
01:05:14,245 --> 01:05:18,332
What do you think of a person
who only does the bare minimum?

1431
01:05:19,917 --> 01:05:22,628
Huh, what do I think?
Um, you know what, Stan...

1432
01:05:23,921 --> 01:05:26,907
if you want me to wear
thirty-seven pieces of flair...

1433
01:05:27,007 --> 01:05:29,326
Iike your, uh, pretty boy
over there, Brian...

1434
01:05:29,426 --> 01:05:30,995
why don't you just
make the minimum...

1435
01:05:31,095 --> 01:05:33,038
thirty-seven pieces of flair?

1436
01:05:33,138 --> 01:05:35,708
Well, I thought
I remembered you saying...

1437
01:05:35,808 --> 01:05:38,002
that you wanted
to express yourself.

1438
01:05:38,102 --> 01:05:40,045
JOANNA: Yeah.
You know what? Yeah, I do.

1439
01:05:40,145 --> 01:05:42,590
I do want to express myself.

1440
01:05:42,690 --> 01:05:45,484
And I don't need thirty-seven
pieces of flair to do it.

1441
01:05:47,069 --> 01:05:49,638
All right? There's my flair. OK?

1442
01:05:49,738 --> 01:05:54,018
And this is me
expressing myself. OK?

1443
01:05:54,118 --> 01:05:55,770
There it is.

1444
01:05:55,870 --> 01:05:57,396
I hate this job.

1445
01:05:57,496 --> 01:06:00,165
I hate this goddamn job,
and I don't need it.

1446
01:06:15,973 --> 01:06:17,041
Oh, shit.

1447
01:06:17,141 --> 01:06:18,709
-Shit.
-Shit.

1448
01:06:18,809 --> 01:06:21,295
-Shit.
-Son of a bitch.

1449
01:06:21,395 --> 01:06:24,090
-Shit.
-This is a fuck.

1450
01:06:24,190 --> 01:06:25,257
SAMIR: l--I...Shit.

1451
01:06:25,357 --> 01:06:26,801
MICHAEL: What happened?

1452
01:06:26,901 --> 01:06:29,011
PETER: You tell me, Michael!
It's your software!

1453
01:06:29,111 --> 01:06:30,638
SAMIR: Yes, it's your software.

1454
01:06:30,738 --> 01:06:32,890
PETER: Corporate accounting
is sure as hell gonna notice...

1455
01:06:32,990 --> 01:06:35,643
three hundred five thousand,
three hundred....

1456
01:06:35,743 --> 01:06:38,979
twenty-six thirteen, Michael!

1457
01:06:39,079 --> 01:06:40,356
SAMIR: Oh, shit.

1458
01:06:40,456 --> 01:06:42,441
MICHAEL: They probably
won't know it's gone...

1459
01:06:42,541 --> 01:06:44,276
for another three or four days.

1460
01:06:44,376 --> 01:06:47,905
Michael! You said this thing
was gonna take two years.

1461
01:06:48,005 --> 01:06:50,491
What happened? You said
the thing was supposed to work!

1462
01:06:50,591 --> 01:06:51,784
MICHAEL:
Technically, it did work.

1463
01:06:51,884 --> 01:06:53,160
No, it didn't!

1464
01:06:53,260 --> 01:06:56,163
SAMIR:
It did not work, Michael, OK?

1465
01:06:56,263 --> 01:06:57,790
MICHAEL: OK.

1466
01:06:57,890 --> 01:07:01,001
I must have put a decimal point
in the wrong place or something.

1467
01:07:01,101 --> 01:07:03,587
I always do that. I always
mess up some mundane detail.

1468
01:07:03,687 --> 01:07:07,675
Oh! Well, this is not
a mundane detail, Michael!

1469
01:07:07,775 --> 01:07:09,301
MICHAEL:
Quit getting pissed at me.

1470
01:07:09,401 --> 01:07:11,278
This was all your idea, asshole.

1471
01:07:12,571 --> 01:07:14,473
All right. OK.

1472
01:07:14,573 --> 01:07:17,059
Let's try not to get
pissed off at each other.

1473
01:07:17,159 --> 01:07:19,645
Let's calm down, try to figure
this thing out together.

1474
01:07:19,745 --> 01:07:23,441
We gotta close that account
before it gets bigger.

1475
01:07:23,541 --> 01:07:27,695
WORKERS SINGING:
Happy birthday to you

1476
01:07:27,795 --> 01:07:32,742
Happy birthday to you

1477
01:07:32,842 --> 01:07:38,456
Happy birthday, Mr. Lumbergh

1478
01:07:38,556 --> 01:07:42,643
Happy birthday to you

1479
01:07:46,981 --> 01:07:48,299
BILL: Looks terrific.

1480
01:07:48,399 --> 01:07:49,508
Mmm.

1481
01:07:49,608 --> 01:07:52,278
Here, Peg, you wanna
get everybody started?

1482
01:07:55,573 --> 01:07:56,682
Mmm.

1483
01:07:56,782 --> 01:07:58,184
Oh, that is terrific.

1484
01:07:58,284 --> 01:07:59,560
Just terrific.

1485
01:07:59,660 --> 01:08:03,355
Thanks, everybody.
I really, really appreciate it.

1486
01:08:03,455 --> 01:08:04,732
It's very special.

1487
01:08:04,832 --> 01:08:07,068
NINA:
Now, Milton, don't be greedy.

1488
01:08:07,168 --> 01:08:10,404
Let's pass it along and make
sure everyone gets a piece.

1489
01:08:10,504 --> 01:08:13,574
MILTON: But last time I didn't
receive a piece and I was told--

1490
01:08:13,674 --> 01:08:15,159
Just pass.

1491
01:08:15,259 --> 01:08:20,472
OK, here. But this...

1492
01:08:22,057 --> 01:08:25,561
The cake...
There's lots of cake?

1493
01:08:26,604 --> 01:08:29,607
The ratio of people to cake
is too big.

1494
01:08:46,832 --> 01:08:49,610
[Mumbles] I could set
the building on fire.

1495
01:08:49,710 --> 01:08:53,781
Is there some way
to just give the money back?

1496
01:08:53,881 --> 01:08:56,659
Hand them a check for the exact
amount they're missing?

1497
01:08:56,759 --> 01:08:59,662
I--I think
they'd figure that out.

1498
01:08:59,762 --> 01:09:01,914
Well, we have to do something.

1499
01:09:02,014 --> 01:09:04,016
Maybe we could launder
the money.

1500
01:09:05,392 --> 01:09:07,294
That's a great idea.

1501
01:09:07,394 --> 01:09:08,462
OK, how do we do that?

1502
01:09:08,562 --> 01:09:10,214
I don't know.

1503
01:09:10,314 --> 01:09:11,966
I don't even know what it means.
I was hoping you knew.

1504
01:09:12,066 --> 01:09:13,801
I think coke dealers do it.

1505
01:09:13,901 --> 01:09:16,445
OK, all right.
Do we know any coke dealers?

1506
01:09:17,363 --> 01:09:18,822
My cousin's a cokehead.

1507
01:09:24,370 --> 01:09:25,855
Fuck.

1508
01:09:25,955 --> 01:09:27,189
We're in deep shit.

1509
01:09:27,289 --> 01:09:31,043
Yes, we are in very,
very deep shit.

1510
01:09:36,048 --> 01:09:37,908
-Milton.
-Yes.

1511
01:09:38,008 --> 01:09:39,160
BILL: What's happening?

1512
01:09:39,260 --> 01:09:41,746
Say, Milton,
you know what'd be great?

1513
01:09:41,846 --> 01:09:42,913
MILTON: But...no.

1514
01:09:43,013 --> 01:09:44,790
BILL: Since you're down here...

1515
01:09:44,890 --> 01:09:48,043
it would be really great
if you could just sort of...

1516
01:09:48,143 --> 01:09:50,880
take care of the cockroach
problem we've had in here.

1517
01:09:50,980 --> 01:09:53,966
That's really not my job, and I
haven't received my paycheck...

1518
01:09:54,066 --> 01:09:55,843
For now,
why don't you go ahead...

1519
01:09:55,943 --> 01:09:59,305
and get yourself a flashlight
and a can of pesticide...

1520
01:09:59,405 --> 01:10:00,514
and crawl down--

1521
01:10:00,614 --> 01:10:03,017
DOM: Bill?
We need you upstairs right away.

1522
01:10:03,117 --> 01:10:04,935
We got a big problem--big.

1523
01:10:05,035 --> 01:10:07,955
Some major glitch in accounting,
a lot of money missing.

1524
01:10:13,210 --> 01:10:14,378
'Scuse me.

1525
01:10:16,255 --> 01:10:17,364
'Scuse me.

1526
01:10:17,464 --> 01:10:18,632
[Door closes]

1527
01:10:20,050 --> 01:10:23,954
OK...but that's
the last straw.

1528
01:10:24,054 --> 01:10:26,499
Here we go, here we go.

1529
01:10:26,599 --> 01:10:30,795
Uh, launder.
"To clean," no. "To wash--"

1530
01:10:30,895 --> 01:10:34,090
"To conceal the source
of money...

1531
01:10:34,190 --> 01:10:37,443
"as by channeling it through
an intermediary."

1532
01:10:38,277 --> 01:10:39,595
"To conceal..."

1533
01:10:39,695 --> 01:10:42,181
SAMIR: That doesn't really
help us, Michael.

1534
01:10:42,281 --> 01:10:43,933
PETER: I can't believe
what a bunch of nerds we are.

1535
01:10:44,033 --> 01:10:46,143
We're looking up money
laundering in a dictionary.

1536
01:10:46,243 --> 01:10:50,731
Yeah, well, you guys
can both eat my ass, OK?

1537
01:10:50,831 --> 01:10:52,566
I can't believe Joanna
slept with Lumbergh.

1538
01:10:52,666 --> 01:10:53,859
That's what I can't believe.

1539
01:10:53,959 --> 01:10:56,862
-Yeah. You didn't know that?
-Yeah, you didn't know that?

1540
01:10:56,962 --> 01:10:59,006
MICHAEL: A couple of years ago,
before he moved to Atlanta.

1541
01:11:01,467 --> 01:11:05,246
You mean Ron Lumbergh,
the lnitrode guy? The young guy?

1542
01:11:05,346 --> 01:11:07,890
Yeah.
Who'd you think I meant? Bill?

1543
01:11:09,934 --> 01:11:12,770
Her fucking--Her children
would have hooves.

1544
01:11:14,647 --> 01:11:16,257
Ron's not related to Bill,
is he?

1545
01:11:16,357 --> 01:11:17,675
[Knock on door]

1546
01:11:17,775 --> 01:11:19,443
SAMIR: Who's that?

1547
01:11:20,486 --> 01:11:21,929
All right, nobody panic.

1548
01:11:22,029 --> 01:11:23,739
Probably just Lawrence.

1549
01:11:27,243 --> 01:11:28,936
Good evening, sir.
My name is Steve.

1550
01:11:29,036 --> 01:11:30,563
I come from a rough area.

1551
01:11:30,663 --> 01:11:32,231
I used to be addicted
to crack...

1552
01:11:32,331 --> 01:11:34,233
but now I'm off
and trying to stay clean.

1553
01:11:34,333 --> 01:11:36,736
That is why I'm selling
magazine subscriptions.

1554
01:11:36,836 --> 01:11:38,779
-No, no.
-Wait a minute.

1555
01:11:38,879 --> 01:11:40,881
MICHAEL: You used to be
addicted to crack?

1556
01:11:42,132 --> 01:11:43,634
Yeah. Um...

1557
01:11:45,302 --> 01:11:47,413
Look, I'm very sorry.

1558
01:11:47,513 --> 01:11:49,999
I do not know anything
about any money laundering.

1559
01:11:50,099 --> 01:11:52,501
MICHAEL: We're not asking you
about money laundering.

1560
01:11:52,601 --> 01:11:53,961
All we need is for you
to hook us--

1561
01:11:54,061 --> 01:11:55,796
PETER: lf he doesn't
know anybody--

1562
01:11:55,896 --> 01:11:57,631
SAMIR: No. Wait a minute.

1563
01:11:57,731 --> 01:12:00,634
Look, you just give us
the name of one drug dealer.

1564
01:12:00,734 --> 01:12:03,095
I could talk to him.
I have good networking skill.

1565
01:12:03,195 --> 01:12:04,305
STEVE: I lied.

1566
01:12:04,405 --> 01:12:07,433
All that stuff I said
about being a crackhead...

1567
01:12:07,533 --> 01:12:09,935
just helps me sell magazines.

1568
01:12:10,035 --> 01:12:12,538
I'm actually an unemployed
software engineer.

1569
01:12:16,375 --> 01:12:19,445
-You're a software engineer?
-Yep.

1570
01:12:19,545 --> 01:12:22,073
Things, they must be
very rough for you.

1571
01:12:22,173 --> 01:12:23,783
Actually, man...

1572
01:12:23,883 --> 01:12:25,868
I make more money selling
magazine subscriptions...

1573
01:12:25,968 --> 01:12:27,411
than I ever did at lnitrode.

1574
01:12:27,511 --> 01:12:29,622
Heh. At lnitrode?

1575
01:12:29,722 --> 01:12:31,665
Wait a minute,
you're not gonna tell anybody...

1576
01:12:31,765 --> 01:12:33,084
about all this stuff
we told you.

1577
01:12:33,184 --> 01:12:36,395
I mean, we know a lot of
the same people. That's...

1578
01:12:38,272 --> 01:12:40,900
Actually, um,
that all depends.

1579
01:12:45,779 --> 01:12:48,866
What am I gonna do with
forty subscriptions to "Vibe"?

1580
01:12:50,159 --> 01:12:51,227
MICHAEL:
We never should have done this.

1581
01:12:51,327 --> 01:12:53,162
What were we thinking?

1582
01:12:54,121 --> 01:12:55,189
You know what I can't
figure out?

1583
01:12:55,289 --> 01:12:58,442
How is it that all these stupid
Neanderthal Mafia guys...

1584
01:12:58,542 --> 01:12:59,902
can be so good at crime...

1585
01:13:00,002 --> 01:13:02,446
and smart guys like us
can suck so badly at it?

1586
01:13:02,546 --> 01:13:04,031
SAMIR: We're new to it, though.

1587
01:13:04,131 --> 01:13:06,659
If we had more experience...

1588
01:13:06,759 --> 01:13:10,121
No. You know what I think?
I think we're screwed.

1589
01:13:10,221 --> 01:13:11,664
I think
there's enough evidence...

1590
01:13:11,764 --> 01:13:13,749
all over that building
to link us to this.

1591
01:13:13,849 --> 01:13:15,918
Even if we could launder money,
I wouldn't want to.

1592
01:13:16,018 --> 01:13:17,586
What we've done is bad enough.

1593
01:13:17,686 --> 01:13:18,921
We get caught
laundering money...

1594
01:13:19,021 --> 01:13:21,006
we're not going
to white-collar resort prison.

1595
01:13:21,106 --> 01:13:24,009
No. We're going to federal
"pound me in the ass" prison.

1596
01:13:24,109 --> 01:13:26,137
SAMIR: I don't want to go
to any prison.

1597
01:13:26,237 --> 01:13:28,472
Why the hell did I do this?

1598
01:13:28,572 --> 01:13:31,183
I've never done anything wrong
in my whole life.

1599
01:13:31,283 --> 01:13:32,518
We weren't thinking clearly...

1600
01:13:32,618 --> 01:13:34,728
because you told us
we were losing our jobs.

1601
01:13:34,828 --> 01:13:37,189
Now look at us, we're worried
about going in a prison.

1602
01:13:37,289 --> 01:13:39,483
Don't worry about it.
I'll think of something.

1603
01:13:39,583 --> 01:13:41,068
[Hisses]

1604
01:13:41,168 --> 01:13:43,195
I'm going home.

1605
01:13:43,295 --> 01:13:44,463
Me, too.

1606
01:13:46,173 --> 01:13:50,302
You are a very...
bad person, Peter.

1607
01:14:08,779 --> 01:14:10,306
[Knocks]

1608
01:14:10,406 --> 01:14:11,807
Lawrence, you awake?

1609
01:14:11,907 --> 01:14:13,117
LAWRENCE: Yeah.

1610
01:14:14,910 --> 01:14:16,103
You wanna come over?

1611
01:14:16,203 --> 01:14:17,271
LAWRENCE: No, thanks, man.

1612
01:14:17,371 --> 01:14:19,582
I don't want you
fucking up my life, too.

1613
01:14:22,418 --> 01:14:23,961
[Crickets chirping]

1614
01:14:25,171 --> 01:14:28,032
In light of the senselessness
of these heinous crimes...

1615
01:14:28,132 --> 01:14:30,493
that you have committed
against lnitech...

1616
01:14:30,593 --> 01:14:33,621
I hereby sentence you,
Michael Bolton...

1617
01:14:33,721 --> 01:14:38,542
and Samir Naan--Nanadajibad...

1618
01:14:38,642 --> 01:14:40,836
to a term of no less
than four years...

1619
01:14:40,936 --> 01:14:44,565
in a federal
"pound me in the ass" prison.

1620
01:14:48,402 --> 01:14:50,179
Peter Gibbons...

1621
01:14:50,279 --> 01:14:53,032
you've led a trite
and meaningless life...

1622
01:14:54,783 --> 01:14:57,661
and you're a very bad person.

1623
01:14:58,996 --> 01:15:00,623
[Bang]

1624
01:15:34,907 --> 01:15:36,075
Hey.

1625
01:15:37,493 --> 01:15:40,020
You're not working
at Chotchkie's anymore, huh?

1626
01:15:40,120 --> 01:15:42,331
JOANNA: No, no. I got fired.

1627
01:15:43,123 --> 01:15:45,568
-What happened?
-I flipped off my boss.

1628
01:15:45,668 --> 01:15:47,737
JOANNA: Some customers...

1629
01:15:47,837 --> 01:15:49,572
Actually, a line cook...

1630
01:15:49,672 --> 01:15:51,632
but he just happened
to be standing there, so...

1631
01:15:52,967 --> 01:15:55,035
I might be going away
for a while.

1632
01:15:55,135 --> 01:15:58,539
Uh...to jail.

1633
01:15:58,639 --> 01:16:00,541
You were right
about that computer scam.

1634
01:16:00,641 --> 01:16:01,917
That was a bad idea.

1635
01:16:02,017 --> 01:16:04,562
I'm gonna take the blame for it,
I decided.

1636
01:16:05,729 --> 01:16:07,965
I'm on my way now
to return the money...

1637
01:16:08,065 --> 01:16:10,484
and leave the confession
under Lumbergh's door.

1638
01:16:12,862 --> 01:16:14,096
Joanna, I want to apologize.

1639
01:16:14,196 --> 01:16:16,640
I had no right to get pissed off
at you about Lumbergh.

1640
01:16:16,740 --> 01:16:18,309
Lumbergh is not my problem.

1641
01:16:18,409 --> 01:16:20,436
It wasn't even
the right Lumbergh.

1642
01:16:20,536 --> 01:16:24,482
I don't know why I can't just...
go to work and be happy...

1643
01:16:24,582 --> 01:16:26,942
Iike I'm supposed to,
like everybody else.

1644
01:16:27,042 --> 01:16:29,195
Peter, most people
don't like their jobs.

1645
01:16:29,295 --> 01:16:33,282
But you go out there and find
something that makes you happy.

1646
01:16:33,382 --> 01:16:35,217
Yeah. Well...

1647
01:16:36,886 --> 01:16:38,954
I may never be happy
at my job...

1648
01:16:39,054 --> 01:16:41,874
but I think that if
I could be with you...

1649
01:16:41,974 --> 01:16:44,001
that I could be happy
with my life.

1650
01:16:44,101 --> 01:16:46,045
I've been a real asshole.

1651
01:16:46,145 --> 01:16:49,256
But, if you'd give it
another shot, I promise--

1652
01:16:49,356 --> 01:16:50,566
OK, shut up.

Get a room, you two! Ha ha!

01:17:03,746 --> 01:17:05,873
I hate that guy.

1656
01:17:56,841 --> 01:17:59,760
MILTON: Then Mr. Lumbergh
told me to talk to payroll...

1657
01:17:59,927 --> 01:18:01,579
and then payroll told me
to talk to Mr. Lumbergh.

1658
01:18:01,679 --> 01:18:04,123
And I still haven't received
my paycheck.

1659
01:18:04,223 --> 01:18:06,917
And he took my stapler,
and he never brought it back.

1660
01:18:07,017 --> 01:18:09,295
And then they moved my desk
to storage room "B."

1661
01:18:09,395 --> 01:18:11,255
And there was
garbage on it, and--

1662
01:18:11,355 --> 01:18:13,799
Why don't you go back down
and sit at your desk?

1663
01:18:13,899 --> 01:18:15,384

should be here any minute.

-Mr. Lumbergh--
-Just go sit at your desk.

I have to take
my stapler back...

1668

because I told him
it's my stapler.

01:18:39,466 --> 01:18:41,285
It's my stapler.

01:22:23,566 --> 01:22:25,426
MICHAEL: All right, chief.

1718
01:22:25,526 --> 01:22:26,761
PETER:
You guys take care, all right?

1719
01:22:26,861 --> 01:22:28,237
MICHAEL: All right.

1720
01:22:29,363 --> 01:22:30,347
Stay in touch, man.

1721
01:22:30,447 --> 01:22:32,199
PETER: OK. Will do.

1722
01:22:36,453 --> 01:22:38,372
PETER: This isn't so bad, huh?

1723
01:22:39,540 --> 01:22:44,487
Making bucks, getting exercise,
working outside.

1724
01:22:44,587 --> 01:22:46,380
Fuckin' "A."

1725
01:22:48,966 --> 01:22:50,759
Fuckin' "A."

1726
01:23:09,153 --> 01:23:11,388
MILTON:
Excuse me. Excuse me, seor.

1727
01:23:11,488 --> 01:23:13,307
May I speak to you, please?

1728
01:23:13,407 --> 01:23:16,018
I asked for a mai tai,
and they brought a pia colada.

1729
01:23:16,118 --> 01:23:18,395
And I said no salt, no salt...

1730
01:23:18,495 --> 01:23:20,189
for the margarita,
but it had salt on it.

1731
01:23:20,289 --> 01:23:22,858
Lo siento mucho, seor.
Pinche gringo.

1732
01:23:22,958 --> 01:23:26,570
I won't be leaving a tip,
'cause I could...

1733
01:23:26,670 --> 01:23:28,447
I could shut
this whole resort down.

1734
01:23:28,547 --> 01:23:30,074
Sir?

1735
01:23:30,174 --> 01:23:34,637
I'll take my traveler's checks
to a competing resort.

1736
01:23:36,555 --> 01:23:39,083
I could write a letter
to your board of tourism.

1737
01:23:39,183 --> 01:23:41,377
I could have this place
condemned.

1738
01:23:41,477 --> 01:23:46,257
I could put, I could put
strychnine in the guacamole.

1739
01:23:46,357 --> 01:23:48,050
There was salt on the glass,
big grains of salt.

1740
01:23:48,150 --> 01:23:48,817
There was salt on the glass,
big grains of salt.

1741
01:24:03,749 --> 01:24:05,693
DREW: Give a ride
on the old bone roller coaster.

1742
01:24:05,793 --> 01:24:07,795
Aaaah!

1743
01:24:08,838 --> 01:24:10,197
CANIBUS RAPPING:
Yeah

1744
01:24:10,297 --> 01:24:13,617
Yo, 6:00 every morning,
you're waking up yawnin'

1745
01:24:13,717 --> 01:24:15,703
To the sound
of your alarm clock alarmin'

1746
01:24:15,803 --> 01:24:17,037
About an hour from now

1747
01:24:17,137 --> 01:24:19,206
You should be
at your place of employment

1748
01:24:19,306 --> 01:24:21,125
Which is annoyin'
'cause it's so borin'

1749
01:24:21,225 --> 01:24:22,334
You coworkers are talking

1750
01:24:22,434 --> 01:24:24,044
LAWRENCE: Don't come back
in a dress, man.

1751
01:24:24,144 --> 01:24:26,297
Ha ha ha. You big fag.

1752
01:24:26,397 --> 01:24:28,716
CANIBUS RAPPING: You wonder
why your workload is so enormous

1753
01:24:28,816 --> 01:24:32,052
'Cause your boss just laid
off 3/4 of the whole office

1754
01:24:32,152 --> 01:24:34,263
People get depressed,
they get ulcers

1755
01:24:34,363 --> 01:24:36,974
From the stress that
the corporate environment causes

1756
01:24:37,074 --> 01:24:39,727
Regardless of how
you ultimately wanna solve this

1757
01:24:39,827 --> 01:24:42,313
Seems to me like you've
got one of four choices

1758
01:24:42,413 --> 01:24:44,774
You can take a new job offer
for more chips

1759
01:24:44,874 --> 01:24:47,485
Stick it out a little longer
or forfeit

1760
01:24:47,585 --> 01:24:49,028
But my advice to anybody--

1761
01:24:49,128 --> 01:24:50,321
JOANNA: I'm working
at Hooters now, you know...

1762
01:24:50,421 --> 01:24:52,406
and it's very cool.

1763
01:24:52,506 --> 01:24:55,076
BIZ MARKIE SINGING:
Take this job and shove it

1764
01:24:55,176 --> 01:24:58,079
I ain't working here no more

1765
01:24:58,179 --> 01:25:00,289
Take this job and shove it

1766
01:25:00,389 --> 01:25:03,417
I ain't working here no more

1767
01:25:03,517 --> 01:25:05,586
Take this job and shove it

1768
01:25:05,686 --> 01:25:08,506
CANIBUS RAPPING: Just shove it,
take this job and shove it

1769
01:25:08,606 --> 01:25:11,300
BIZ MARKIE SINGING:
Take this job, take this job

1770
01:25:11,400 --> 01:25:13,302
take this job and shove it,
shove it

1771
01:25:13,402 --> 01:25:15,513
CANIBUS RAPPING:
Yo, if your boss is a S.O.B.

1772
01:25:15,613 --> 01:25:18,641
Tell him to s-h-o-v-e the j-o-b

1773
01:25:18,741 --> 01:25:21,060
Put your middle finger
up slowly

1774
01:25:21,160 --> 01:25:24,438
Put it close enough to his face
so he can examine it closely

1775
01:25:24,538 --> 01:25:26,232
Say "l ain't working here
no more

1776
01:25:26,332 --> 01:25:27,525
"Who do you think you are?"

1777
01:25:27,625 --> 01:25:29,276
Whip the apron off,
throw it on the floor

1778
01:25:29,376 --> 01:25:32,655
Run to the door, to the pay
phone, make a toll-free call

1779
01:25:32,755 --> 01:25:34,782
Tell your stocks what happened
and where you are

1780
01:25:34,882 --> 01:25:37,284
So they can come
and get you in the car later on

1781
01:25:37,384 --> 01:25:39,954
And help you search
for a new nine-to-five job

1782
01:25:40,054 --> 01:25:42,415
If the unemployment line
ain't that long

1783
01:25:42,515 --> 01:25:45,167
You can take your time
filling out W-9 forms

1784
01:25:45,267 --> 01:25:48,129
Eventually, you'll get on
if you try hard enough

1785
01:25:48,229 --> 01:25:50,798
And you get money if you keep
punching your time card enough

1786
01:25:50,898 --> 01:25:52,466
Maybe you hate it,
maybe you love it

1787
01:25:52,566 --> 01:25:54,427
But if you hate it,
all you gotta do

1788
01:25:54,527 --> 01:25:56,011
Is get mad
and tell your boss to

1789
01:25:56,111 --> 01:25:57,972
BIZ MARKIE SINGING:
Take this job and shove it

1790
01:25:58,072 --> 01:26:01,350
I ain't working here no more

1791
01:26:01,450 --> 01:26:03,269
Take this job and shove it

1792
01:26:03,369 --> 01:26:06,522
I ain't working here no more

1793
01:26:06,622 --> 01:26:08,858
Take this job and shove it

1794
01:26:08,958 --> 01:26:11,777
I ain't working here no more

1795
01:26:11,877 --> 01:26:16,574
Take this job, take this job,
take this job and shove it

1796
01:26:16,674 --> 01:26:19,243
CANIBUS RAPPING: Yo, so mind
your patience or like slave gigs

1797
01:26:19,343 --> 01:26:21,746
The boss' favorite to get
placed in something spacious

1798
01:26:21,846 --> 01:26:23,372
While the most hated get placed

1799
01:26:23,472 --> 01:26:25,040
In some small cubicle spaces

1800
01:26:25,140 --> 01:26:26,667
Or get thrown down
in the basement

1801
01:26:26,767 --> 01:26:29,462
Get your stapler confiscated,
you constantly waitin'

1802
01:26:29,562 --> 01:26:31,714
For a paycheck,
twelve months pass by

1803
01:26:31,814 --> 01:26:33,048
And you still ain't get paid yet

1804
01:26:33,148 --> 01:26:34,592
Here's an optimistic motto

1805
01:26:34,692 --> 01:26:36,302
If you ever late for today

1806
01:26:36,402 --> 01:26:38,220
You can stay early for tomorrow

1807
01:26:38,320 --> 01:26:39,930
Most nine-to-fives are hard

1808
01:26:40,030 --> 01:26:41,390
'Cause the description
of the job

1809
01:26:41,490 --> 01:26:43,184
Ain't no picnic in the park

1810
01:26:43,284 --> 01:26:46,061
People get hired,
drink coffee to stay wired

1811
01:26:46,161 --> 01:26:48,606
So they don't get tired,
sleep late, and get fired

1812
01:26:48,706 --> 01:26:51,066
BIZ MARKIE RAPPING: You came in
late, you already ate

1813
01:26:51,166 --> 01:26:53,694
Now, you want
to take a lunch break?

1814
01:26:53,794 --> 01:26:56,489
CANIBUS RAPPING: Yo, bust it,
ain't no need to discuss it

1815
01:26:56,589 --> 01:26:59,492
Just take this job and shove it
right between your buttocks

1816
01:26:59,592 --> 01:27:01,243
BIZ MARKIE SINGING:
Take this job and shove it

1817
01:27:01,343 --> 01:27:04,580
I ain't working here no more

1818
01:27:04,680 --> 01:27:06,457
Take this job and shove it

1819
01:27:06,557 --> 01:27:09,627
I ain't working here no more

1820
01:27:09,727 --> 01:27:12,171
Take this job and shove it

1821
01:27:12,271 --> 01:27:15,091
I ain't working here no more

1822
01:27:15,191 --> 01:27:17,468
Take this job, take this job

1823
01:27:17,568 --> 01:27:20,387
Take this job and shove it

1824
01:27:20,487 --> 01:27:22,264
Take this job and shove it

1825
01:27:22,364 --> 01:27:25,684
I ain't working here no more

1826
01:27:25,784 --> 01:27:28,062
A-a-ah a-a-a-a-ah

1827
01:27:28,162 --> 01:27:30,940
I ain't working here no more

1828
01:27:31,040 --> 01:27:32,900
Take this job and shove it

1829
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:36,278
I ain't working here no more

1830
01:27:36,378 --> 01:27:40,408
Ay-ya ya-ya-ya,
I ain't working here no more

1831
01:27:40,508 --> 01:27:42,051
CANIBUS RAPPING: Just shove it

1832
01:27:43,719 --> 01:27:46,497
BIZ MARKIE SINGING:
Canibus and the Biz

1833
01:27:46,597 --> 01:27:48,916
Ah-aah aah-ah

1834
01:27:49,016 --> 01:27:52,645
It's coming from
Canibus and the Biz

1835
01:27:54,480 --> 01:27:57,191
It's coming from
Canibus and the Biz

1836
01:27:58,317 --> 01:28:09,745
From, from Canibus
and the Bi-i-i-

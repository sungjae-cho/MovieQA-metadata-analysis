1
00:00:30,547 --> 00:00:32,139
No.

2
00:00:39,089 --> 00:00:41,421
No means no.

3
00:00:51,367 --> 00:00:52,732
Bonjour.

4
00:00:52,902 --> 00:00:54,335
Carl, I know it's you.

5
00:00:54,504 --> 00:00:56,199
Oh. Hey, man.

6
00:00:56,406 --> 00:00:58,874
I was just about to call you.
That's so weird.

7
00:00:59,042 --> 00:01:01,340
Had your number dialed,
was about to press "send."

8
00:01:01,511 --> 00:01:02,705
Did you block your number?

9
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:07,007
Yeah, I did.
You never answer when I don't.

10
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:08,940
So, what are you doing?

11
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:11,383
Oh, just hanging out in my apartment.

12
00:01:11,554 --> 00:01:14,022
- You did get my text, right?
- What? Text? What?

13
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:15,623
We're all going out tonight.

14
00:01:15,792 --> 00:01:18,386
Man, that sounds great.
I wish I could join you.

15
00:01:18,561 --> 00:01:19,585
I'm just so jammed up.

16
00:01:19,763 --> 00:01:21,628
I'm totally off the grid,
you know?

17
00:01:21,798 --> 00:01:23,060
No, I don't at all.

18
00:01:23,233 --> 00:01:26,396
I got a bunch of stuff going on.
There's this thing I gotta do.

19
00:01:26,569 --> 00:01:29,299
Any other night would've been great.
Darn it to heck.

20
00:01:29,472 --> 00:01:30,700
Thing? What thing?

21
00:01:30,874 --> 00:01:32,364
Thing, you know, just a thing.

22
00:01:32,542 --> 00:01:35,477
If I had my thing in front of me,
I could tell you what it is...

23
00:01:35,645 --> 00:01:37,875
- ...but I know there's a thing.
- A thing.

24
00:01:38,047 --> 00:01:41,141
I don't think there's anything
written down in your fake calendar.

25
00:01:41,317 --> 00:01:42,909
No, it says specific things.

26
00:01:43,086 --> 00:01:46,180
Specific things. Like
"get in line at the video store"?

27
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:48,483
What? What are you talking about?

28
00:01:48,658 --> 00:01:51,149
I'm not at the video store.
I'm in my apartment.

29
00:01:51,327 --> 00:01:54,763
I can see you, Carl.
I'm outside the video store.

30
00:01:56,933 --> 00:01:58,730
- That's not me.
- It's not?

31
00:01:58,902 --> 00:02:02,599
Oh, I know what's happening. There
is this guy who looks just like me...

32
00:02:02,772 --> 00:02:04,831
...who goes to a lot of
the same stores I do.

33
00:02:05,008 --> 00:02:06,600
That's probably who you're seeing.

34
00:02:06,776 --> 00:02:07,800
Wow, that's amazing...

35
00:02:07,977 --> 00:02:10,912
...because his mouth is moving
in sync with what you're saying.

36
00:02:12,615 --> 00:02:14,606
Carl, I know you're
not saying anything.

37
00:02:15,752 --> 00:02:18,050
Carl, get outside.
I know you're not talking.

38
00:02:18,221 --> 00:02:20,883
- What? All right.
- Carl.

39
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,786
- Look who's here.
- Hey. You.

40
00:02:27,931 --> 00:02:29,421
Hi.

41
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:31,794
- I don't believe it.
- Rooney.

42
00:02:31,968 --> 00:02:35,404
Carl Allen. Never thought
I'd see the day, my man.

43
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:38,370
- Hey.
- Thought you hung up the spurs, cowboy.

44
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:40,475
No, I just got a lot
of stuff going on...

45
00:02:40,643 --> 00:02:44,238
...some things I gotta do,
issues pending, keep me pretty busy.

46
00:02:44,414 --> 00:02:45,972
Yeah? Oh, I hear you, player.

47
00:02:46,149 --> 00:02:48,617
So we are really excited
for you to be here, Carl...

48
00:02:48,785 --> 00:02:51,219
...because we have an
announcement to make.

49
00:02:51,387 --> 00:02:53,287
Honey, show him.

50
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:56,019
There it is. Deal with it.

51
00:02:56,192 --> 00:02:57,489
We're engaged.

52
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:00,060
- Oh, my God. Come on.
- Right?

53
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:03,791
- Big step, huh?
- Yeah, it's a big step. It's a huge one.

54
00:03:03,967 --> 00:03:05,832
Man. Moving fast. That's okay.

55
00:03:06,002 --> 00:03:07,367
What has it been, six months?

56
00:03:07,537 --> 00:03:09,368
- No.
- Two years.

57
00:03:09,539 --> 00:03:12,007
Oh, yeah. That's about right, then.

58
00:03:12,842 --> 00:03:16,778
So anyway, we're gonna have an
engagement party on the 21st. Open bar.

59
00:03:16,946 --> 00:03:19,005
Oh, you bastard.
Always knows how to get me.

60
00:03:19,182 --> 00:03:21,207
Nice. Carl, does that work for you?

61
00:03:21,651 --> 00:03:24,620
- Yeah, we'll figure it out.
- What's there to figure out?

62
00:03:25,221 --> 00:03:26,381
Oh, God, look who's here.

63
00:03:26,556 --> 00:03:29,150
I'm not falling for that, Carl.
What's to figure out?

64
00:03:29,325 --> 00:03:32,385
- Open bar. What's the problem?
- I'm serious. Stephanie's at the bar.

65
00:03:32,562 --> 00:03:35,622
- The Stephanie?
- Yes, my ex-wife. She's at the bar.

66
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,727
Oh, God, that is Stephanie.

67
00:03:39,903 --> 00:03:43,703
- Looks like she's with someone there too.
- They seem to be thriving. Good for her.

68
00:03:45,875 --> 00:03:48,571
They're touching each other's
genitals. Isn't that amazing?

69
00:03:48,745 --> 00:03:51,839
I'm so glad I came out. Love it.
Okay, you know what? I gotta go.

70
00:03:52,015 --> 00:03:54,313
- No. No. Carl, you're gonna stay.
- What?

71
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:56,679
It's been years.
You leave every time she comes.

72
00:03:56,853 --> 00:03:59,481
Totally unrelated. It has nothing
to do with Stephanie.

73
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:01,681
Carl. Peter.

74
00:04:01,858 --> 00:04:03,223
- Rooney.
- Stephanie, guys.

75
00:04:03,393 --> 00:04:04,655
Hey.

76
00:04:04,827 --> 00:04:06,920
- My boyfriend, Ted.
- Hey.

77
00:04:07,096 --> 00:04:10,088
- I don't believe we...
- No, I don't believe we have.

78
00:04:10,633 --> 00:04:12,863
- You're leaving?
- Yeah, unfortunately.

79
00:04:13,036 --> 00:04:15,561
Terrible timing too,
because you just got here.

80
00:04:15,738 --> 00:04:17,330
You just got here, too, Carl.

81
00:04:18,474 --> 00:04:21,068
Yeah, but he's got a thing.

82
00:04:21,244 --> 00:04:24,270
Yeah, that's a thing.
There's a thing, and there's no time.

83
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:27,348
There's a time crunch,
and time is of the essence.

84
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:31,180
Anyway, I am gone-orrhea.

85
00:04:33,256 --> 00:04:36,123
Wow. That didn't sound quite right.
Oh, well.

86
00:04:36,292 --> 00:04:37,850
Whoa!

87
00:04:46,769 --> 00:04:48,532
See you, guys.

88
00:05:07,523 --> 00:05:11,254
- Oh! Hi, Tillie.
- Morning, Carl.

89
00:05:11,427 --> 00:05:13,759
Would you like to come over
for a little breakfast?

90
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:16,057
Gee, that sounds great, but I can't.

91
00:05:16,232 --> 00:05:19,133
- Some cereal, a little yogurt?
- Yeah, no.

92
00:05:19,302 --> 00:05:20,894
How about some toast, huh?

93
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:24,335
You know, I have to go to work,
but thanks.

94
00:05:24,507 --> 00:05:26,771
Good show tonight.
Come check us out.

95
00:05:27,377 --> 00:05:29,368
Your loss. Hey, man,
wanna rock out tonight?

96
00:05:29,545 --> 00:05:32,105
- Oh, it's you. Let me guess, no?
- Yep.

97
00:05:32,281 --> 00:05:35,614
- Yes?
- No, I meant yes to your no.

98
00:05:36,452 --> 00:05:37,749
Yeah, bye.

99
00:05:38,788 --> 00:05:42,884
Persianwifefinder.com.
No, thank you.

100
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:47,123
Costume party. Yeah, no.

101
00:05:49,065 --> 00:05:50,089
Oh, boy.

102
00:05:52,502 --> 00:05:54,163
Here we go.

103
00:05:54,337 --> 00:05:58,273
- Carl Allen has reported for duty.
- I'm not a soldier, Norman.

104
00:05:59,142 --> 00:06:01,542
You're a soldier on the front line
of finance.

105
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:04,436
Norman. Line one.

106
00:06:05,515 --> 00:06:07,983
Did you wanna get that?
In the privacy of your office?

107
00:06:08,151 --> 00:06:11,211
- I'll just get it here.
- Yeah, or that.

108
00:06:11,854 --> 00:06:13,344
You're with Norman.

109
00:06:13,723 --> 00:06:19,184
Uh-huh. Are you sure? Because...
Okay. Yep. Whatever you say.

110
00:06:19,362 --> 00:06:20,693
Okay.

111
00:06:22,965 --> 00:06:25,058
Remember that promotion
we were talking about?

112
00:06:25,234 --> 00:06:26,633
- Yeah.
- It's not gonna happen.

113
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:28,896
Tried to fight for you
on the phone there.

114
00:06:29,072 --> 00:06:31,597
It was between you and Demko,
and they went with Demko.

115
00:06:31,774 --> 00:06:34,675
I don't care.
I didn't really want the job badly.

116
00:06:34,844 --> 00:06:38,245
I just figured after five years,
I'd be the logical choice, but whatever.

117
00:06:38,414 --> 00:06:41,508
Look at it this way:
at least you didn't get shit-canned.

118
00:06:41,684 --> 00:06:44,482
- Do you know what that means?
- Fired?

119
00:06:44,987 --> 00:06:48,252
How did you know what that meant?
Have you heard me say that before?

120
00:06:48,424 --> 00:06:50,324
No, it's a pretty common expression.

121
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:55,226
- In my circles. I made it up.
- Well, it's catching on.

122
00:06:55,398 --> 00:06:58,458
This'll cheer you up. I'm having
a little get-together at my place.

123
00:06:58,634 --> 00:07:02,570
- It's a funny hat and-or wig party.
- Oh, man.

124
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:05,163
Sucks I'm gonna be out of town.

125
00:07:05,741 --> 00:07:07,732
- You don't know what day it is.
- When is it?

126
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:09,070
- Friday.
- I'm out of town.

127
00:07:09,645 --> 00:07:11,613
You spoke at the same time
I did just then.

128
00:07:11,781 --> 00:07:14,409
Like you were committed to
saying what you were saying...

129
00:07:14,584 --> 00:07:17,644
- ...regardless of what I was gonna say.
- Hm.

130
00:07:18,921 --> 00:07:20,855
I admit, business has been slow.

131
00:07:21,023 --> 00:07:23,958
There's a lot less demand
for a small Rollerblade shop...

132
00:07:24,127 --> 00:07:26,186
...what with Big 5
and Sport Chalet...

133
00:07:26,395 --> 00:07:29,796
...but my designs are gonna
revolutionize the roller industry.

134
00:07:29,966 --> 00:07:33,868
I know that, Marv,
but you have no equity.

135
00:07:34,036 --> 00:07:35,196
- None.
- And your credit...

136
00:07:35,371 --> 00:07:37,896
Bad, but I don't wanna
sound desperate.

137
00:07:38,074 --> 00:07:41,100
- Yeah.
- I have no other options left.

138
00:07:52,054 --> 00:07:54,784
Carl. Hey. Long time no see.

139
00:07:54,957 --> 00:07:57,790
Nick Lane? Hey.

140
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:00,929
- You don't still work at the bank, do you?
- Yeah.

141
00:08:01,097 --> 00:08:05,227
Kind of why I'm sitting outside here,
eating my lunch, wearing the name tag.

142
00:08:05,401 --> 00:08:07,426
You must be running this place by now.

143
00:08:07,603 --> 00:08:11,095
I could have. Had a couple offers.
Didn't wanna get tied down.

144
00:08:11,274 --> 00:08:12,673
- How's Stephanie?
- Good.

145
00:08:12,842 --> 00:08:14,503
God.

146
00:08:15,111 --> 00:08:17,636
She's good. What have you been doing?

147
00:08:17,813 --> 00:08:20,976
I've been all over the map, man.
I've lived.

148
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:24,677
I climbed Mount Kilimanjaro.
I ate bat in Laos.

149
00:08:24,854 --> 00:08:26,412
I shot a cow with a bazooka.

150
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:29,581
I'm not proud of that last one,
but I did it, man.

151
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:32,990
- Sounds wild.
- Wanna know my secret?

152
00:08:33,996 --> 00:08:35,122
I'm a yes man.

153
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:38,264
The word "yes"
has changed my life. Here.

154
00:08:38,434 --> 00:08:40,163
No, thanks. I'm fine.

155
00:08:40,336 --> 00:08:42,099
"Fine?" I wipe my ass with "fine."

156
00:08:42,271 --> 00:08:43,932
Wow. Okay.

157
00:08:44,106 --> 00:08:48,600
- You don't wanna work here, Carl.
- Yeah, I do.

158
00:08:48,911 --> 00:08:50,606
No, you don't.

159
00:08:51,981 --> 00:08:53,471
Why don't you take this rock...

160
00:08:53,649 --> 00:08:56,777
...throw it at that bank
and shatter the window?

161
00:08:56,953 --> 00:08:59,945
- No, thanks.
- Then ask me if I want to.

162
00:09:00,122 --> 00:09:02,716
- Do you wanna throw that rock at the bank?
- Yes.

163
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:05,857
Oh, my God.

164
00:09:06,028 --> 00:09:08,223
- What are you, nuts?
- Go to the seminar, Carl.

165
00:09:08,698 --> 00:09:09,722
Stay right there.

166
00:09:09,899 --> 00:09:11,730
- He's gonna break.
- Stop.

167
00:09:16,105 --> 00:09:20,235
Carl, live your life!
You won't regret it.

168
00:09:20,409 --> 00:09:23,276
- Whoo!
- Hey, stop. Stop!

169
00:09:33,289 --> 00:09:35,587
- I know you wanna see my band.
- No.

170
00:09:36,192 --> 00:09:37,216
Sorry.

171
00:09:39,161 --> 00:09:40,890
- Hello?
- Stephanie?

172
00:09:41,063 --> 00:09:43,395
- Carl.
- Yeah, it's me.

173
00:09:43,566 --> 00:09:47,696
Just felt like calling you.
I was missing you, I guess. Weird, huh?

174
00:09:48,137 --> 00:09:49,627
Yes, Carl. I have to go.

175
00:09:49,805 --> 00:09:53,002
- Ted and I are taking a little boat ride.
- Oh, that's great.

176
00:09:53,175 --> 00:09:55,200
Good for you. Good for you.

177
00:10:06,656 --> 00:10:10,114
Jesus, Pete. I'm not in or I'm busy.

178
00:10:16,565 --> 00:10:20,228
Oh, come on. You're halfway through,
just snap it off already.

179
00:10:27,977 --> 00:10:31,913
- Pete? Hey. Where you been?
- You not been getting my calls?

180
00:10:32,081 --> 00:10:36,450
What? God, no.
Oh, I totally lost my phone.

181
00:10:36,619 --> 00:10:37,984
You're so full of shit.

182
00:10:39,388 --> 00:10:42,789
- Here it is.
- Yeah. There it is.

183
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:45,756
You know what, buddy?
You missed my engagement party tonight.

184
00:10:46,128 --> 00:10:49,495
Oh, no. Oh, shoot, you're kidding.
That was tonight?

185
00:10:49,665 --> 00:10:52,896
- Mm-hm.
- I'm so sorry, man. I totally gapped it.

186
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:55,629
Listen, I'll make it up to you.
I promise. I swear.

187
00:10:55,805 --> 00:10:58,672
You pick the day. Any day you want,
we'll go out, swashbuckle.

188
00:10:58,841 --> 00:11:01,207
- What does that even mean?
- I don't know.

189
00:11:01,377 --> 00:11:05,404
This wasn't drinks at a bar, Carl.
This was my engagement party.

190
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:08,573
- You only get married once.
- I certainly wouldn't do it again.

191
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:11,151
I know, Carl.
I know that Stephanie left you.

192
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:15,484
And I know that you have issues because
of it, but this isn't about you. It's about me.

193
00:11:16,125 --> 00:11:19,185
When's the last time you did
anything fun? You always make excuses.

194
00:11:19,362 --> 00:11:21,796
"I don't wanna commit.
I don't wanna be tied down."

195
00:11:21,964 --> 00:11:24,159
I mean, do you even know
my fiancée's last name?

196
00:11:24,333 --> 00:11:27,302
Yeah. Fisher. Fishman.

197
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:31,702
- Wait. Fishwall?
- Fishwall?

198
00:11:31,874 --> 00:11:35,105
- You think her name's Lucy Fishwall?
- No? That's wrong?

199
00:11:35,277 --> 00:11:36,767
- It's Burns.
- Burns?

200
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:39,308
It's Lucy Burns, Carl.

201
00:11:39,482 --> 00:11:42,178
And guess what?
She doesn't like my best friend.

202
00:11:42,718 --> 00:11:45,846
I keep trying to think of reasons
why she should, but you know what?

203
00:11:46,021 --> 00:11:47,886
- I can't think of any.
- Pete, I...

204
00:11:48,057 --> 00:11:51,151
I don't wanna hear another excuse, Carl.
You do whatever you want.

205
00:11:51,327 --> 00:11:54,660
I'm telling you, you don't change your life,
you're gonna end up lonely.

206
00:11:54,830 --> 00:12:00,200
A lonely guy, Carl. Lonely guy.

207
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,735
Hey, Carl.

208
00:12:10,546 --> 00:12:12,514
Hey, Rooney, come here for a second.

209
00:12:15,451 --> 00:12:19,854
Carl look a little odd to you? Is it me,
or does it look like he's kind of dead?

210
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:23,585
Nope. No more than usual.

211
00:12:23,759 --> 00:12:27,559
I don't know. I'm kind of leaning towards
thinking he might actually be dead.

212
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:33,268
I guess I never saw him a lot,
so it's hard for me to tell the difference.

213
00:12:33,469 --> 00:12:35,198
Yeah, that's true.

214
00:12:35,871 --> 00:12:37,532
He never did much.

215
00:12:37,706 --> 00:12:39,037
- Wasn't a good friend.
- Nope.

216
00:12:39,775 --> 00:12:41,675
Wasn't a good anything.

217
00:12:41,844 --> 00:12:45,837
- Are there more beers in the fridge?
- Sorry, last one.

218
00:12:46,515 --> 00:12:47,846
Now, that's upsetting.

219
00:12:53,722 --> 00:12:55,656
What was that?

220
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:42,635
Welcome to yes.
We are about to begin.

221
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:45,499
Please, find a seat.

222
00:13:45,975 --> 00:13:49,001
Carl? Hey, Carl! Psst!

223
00:13:49,178 --> 00:13:50,702
Carl, man, hey.

224
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,973
- Carl.
- Hey, Nick.

225
00:13:53,482 --> 00:13:55,347
- You made it, man.
- Did you wanna...

226
00:13:55,518 --> 00:13:57,679
Sure, let me sit down.
I knew you'd come.

227
00:13:57,853 --> 00:14:01,687
I saw it in your eyes, man.
You're gonna love this. Terrence is a genius.

228
00:14:01,857 --> 00:14:05,884
He's gonna blow your mind all over
the room. He's like a mind grenade.

229
00:14:06,061 --> 00:14:08,529
- I'm not sure I want that.
- Yeah, but you need it.

230
00:14:08,697 --> 00:14:09,891
That's why you're here.

231
00:14:10,065 --> 00:14:13,933
You have got to start saying yes, my man,
and I mean to everything.

232
00:14:14,737 --> 00:14:15,931
It's starting.

233
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:18,463
Life.

234
00:14:18,807 --> 00:14:22,368
We are all living it. Or are we?

235
00:14:22,545 --> 00:14:23,910
Ooh, heavy.

236
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:30,484
Change is generated from consciousness,
but where is consciousness generated from?

237
00:14:30,653 --> 00:14:32,780
From the external.

238
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:37,016
And how do we control the external?
With one word.

239
00:14:37,793 --> 00:14:39,124
And what is that word?

240
00:14:39,595 --> 00:14:41,688
- Yes!
- Jeez.

241
00:14:44,767 --> 00:14:45,859
Yes.

242
00:14:46,502 --> 00:14:47,526
Yes.

243
00:14:49,371 --> 00:14:52,238
- Yes, yes, yes!
- Yes. Yes!

244
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,841
- Yes!
- Whoo!

245
00:15:00,516 --> 00:15:02,347
The word is "yes."

246
00:15:03,052 --> 00:15:06,385
Yes, yes, yes.

247
00:15:06,622 --> 00:15:08,817
- Say it a million times.
- Yes.

248
00:15:09,024 --> 00:15:10,685
Say it a million more times.

249
00:15:10,859 --> 00:15:14,158
And the word you will have said
2 million times is:

250
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:16,457
Yes!

251
00:15:23,439 --> 00:15:24,497
Yes.

252
00:15:24,773 --> 00:15:29,676
I want you to invite yes into your lives...

253
00:15:29,845 --> 00:15:34,680
...because it will RSVP "yes."

254
00:15:35,718 --> 00:15:40,746
When you say yes to things,
you embrace the possible.

255
00:15:40,923 --> 00:15:47,351
You gobble up all of life's energies,
and you excrete the waste.

256
00:15:48,397 --> 00:15:54,302
Before we begin today,
I'd like to welcome our new members.

257
00:15:56,705 --> 00:16:01,642
- Who among you is new?
- He is. This guy right here. He's new.

258
00:16:01,810 --> 00:16:03,937
- Over here.
- Please don't. Jesus.

259
00:16:04,113 --> 00:16:10,382
- Come on up, future yes man.
- That's okay, I'm just auditing.

260
00:16:13,355 --> 00:16:17,951
You can't audit life, my friend.
Now get on up here.

261
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:23,759
- No, thanks. I'm cool.
- I'm sorry? What was that you said?

262
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:29,600
- I said, I'm cool.
- Before that.

263
00:16:30,939 --> 00:16:32,167
Thank you.

264
00:16:32,341 --> 00:16:35,401
Back up just a little bit more.

265
00:16:35,577 --> 00:16:38,341
- No.
- No man. No man.

266
00:16:38,514 --> 00:16:40,573
No man. No man. No man.

267
00:16:40,749 --> 00:16:41,943
No man. No man.

268
00:16:42,117 --> 00:16:43,516
Okay.

269
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:48,189
If the molehill won't come to Terrence...

270
00:16:49,124 --> 00:16:52,582
...Terrence will come to the molehill.

271
00:17:00,736 --> 00:17:01,794
What's your name?

272
00:17:03,605 --> 00:17:05,038
Carl.

273
00:17:05,474 --> 00:17:06,839
Let me guess, Carl.

274
00:17:07,009 --> 00:17:09,671
Someone talked you
into coming here today, didn't they?

275
00:17:10,779 --> 00:17:13,270
- Yes.
- Yes!

276
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:17,180
And you're not sure about this, are you?

277
00:17:17,786 --> 00:17:18,810
No.

278
00:17:18,987 --> 00:17:23,048
No man. No man.
No man. No man.

279
00:17:23,225 --> 00:17:24,852
You're dead, Carl.

280
00:17:25,627 --> 00:17:28,960
You say no to life,
and therefore you're not living.

281
00:17:29,398 --> 00:17:32,128
You make up excuses
to the people around you...

282
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:33,666
...and to yourself.

283
00:17:34,169 --> 00:17:37,730
You're stuck in the same dead-end job.
You have been for years.

284
00:17:37,906 --> 00:17:42,138
You don't have a girlfriend. You don't
have anything close to a girlfriend.

285
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:44,176
And you lost the love of your life...

286
00:17:44,346 --> 00:17:47,338
...because she couldn't be with someone
who didn't live theirs.

287
00:17:50,886 --> 00:17:55,152
And on most nights you're so bored
and filled with ennui...

288
00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:59,488
...you can't even summon the enthusiasm
necessary to masturbate.

289
00:18:00,529 --> 00:18:02,622
Am I right, Carl?

290
00:18:06,935 --> 00:18:10,496
I have had some trouble.

291
00:18:17,045 --> 00:18:20,537
- We're gonna make a covenant, Carl.
- Yes.

292
00:18:20,716 --> 00:18:24,174
- Do you want to make a covenant?
- Ugh...

293
00:18:25,621 --> 00:18:27,145
The word is "yes," Carl.

294
00:18:27,322 --> 00:18:28,550
- Yes!
- Yes.

295
00:18:28,724 --> 00:18:29,748
- Yes!
- Yes.

296
00:18:29,925 --> 00:18:31,415
Yes!

297
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:34,454
Once you leave this building...

298
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:38,622
...every time an opportunity
presents itself...

299
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:41,598
...no matter what it is...

300
00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:43,829
...you will say yes.

301
00:18:44,006 --> 00:18:45,098
- Yes.
- Yes!

302
00:18:45,274 --> 00:18:46,571
- Yes.
- Yes!

303
00:18:46,742 --> 00:18:48,835
- Yes.
- Yes.

304
00:18:50,279 --> 00:18:52,042
What if I...

305
00:18:53,282 --> 00:18:54,943
...say...

306
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:56,908
...the other word?

307
00:18:57,719 --> 00:19:00,654
You'll be making a promise to yourself.

308
00:19:00,823 --> 00:19:04,850
And when you break a promise
to yourself...

309
00:19:05,027 --> 00:19:08,326
...things can get a little dicey.

310
00:19:08,497 --> 00:19:11,057
What do you say, Carl?

311
00:19:11,466 --> 00:19:14,697
Are you ready to make a covenant?

312
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:16,631
- Come on, Carl.
- Yes.

313
00:19:16,805 --> 00:19:18,102
- Yes.
- Yes.

314
00:19:18,273 --> 00:19:20,400
- Yes.
- Again.

315
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:22,009
- Yes.
- Yes.

316
00:19:22,177 --> 00:19:24,008
- Say it again.
- Yes!

317
00:19:25,948 --> 00:19:29,782
- Make me believe it.
- Yes, yes, yes.

318
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:34,647
Yes!

319
00:20:03,352 --> 00:20:04,376
Hey, there he is.

320
00:20:04,553 --> 00:20:06,316
- That was really wonderful.
- Thank you.

321
00:20:06,488 --> 00:20:07,853
Pretty powerful stuff, huh?

322
00:20:08,023 --> 00:20:10,321
- Hey. Good to have you with us.
- Yes.

323
00:20:10,492 --> 00:20:13,950
- So are you gonna do it?
- I don't know. Maybe.

324
00:20:14,129 --> 00:20:18,327
That's weird. I didn't realize
we just stepped out of a "maybe" seminar.

325
00:20:20,502 --> 00:20:23,699
Hey, man. That's a nice car.

326
00:20:24,506 --> 00:20:27,236
Could you drive me to Elysian Park?

327
00:20:28,176 --> 00:20:29,973
Oh. Ugh...

328
00:20:30,145 --> 00:20:31,510
Yes!

329
00:20:32,381 --> 00:20:35,942
Sure he can. Right, Carl?

330
00:20:39,087 --> 00:20:40,520
Yeah, why not?

331
00:20:41,423 --> 00:20:45,052
Yes. You won't regret this, Carl.

332
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:55,095
- Can I use your phone?
- Go, man, go.

333
00:21:23,966 --> 00:21:27,595
Keep going or this'll do,
because it doesn't really matter?

334
00:21:27,769 --> 00:21:29,964
Yeah, hold on a sec,
I can't hear myself think.

335
00:21:30,138 --> 00:21:33,733
It's just a little further, man.
Just right up the hill there.

336
00:21:33,909 --> 00:21:35,638
Go ahead.

337
00:21:36,979 --> 00:21:38,469
And what did you say?

338
00:21:39,915 --> 00:21:45,046
Oh, I'm just right over here.
Okay. Yeah.

339
00:21:45,654 --> 00:21:46,882
What? Hello? Hello?

340
00:21:48,290 --> 00:21:50,758
Oh, shit, man. Your battery's dead.

341
00:21:50,926 --> 00:21:52,587
Oh, great.

342
00:21:53,829 --> 00:21:57,788
- Thanks.
- Well, gracias, amigo.

343
00:21:57,966 --> 00:22:01,424
I mean, it's real nice of you to
give me a ride. Most people just say no.

344
00:22:01,970 --> 00:22:05,269
Course, I have been having a lot of
luck lately outside of that hotel.

345
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:08,107
No problem. Have a good night.

346
00:22:08,977 --> 00:22:10,911
Can I borrow a couple bucks?

347
00:22:13,281 --> 00:22:14,305
Okay.

348
00:22:15,484 --> 00:22:17,509
I've come this far.

349
00:22:19,454 --> 00:22:21,115
Yes, you can.

350
00:22:21,289 --> 00:22:24,019
You got a whole lot there.
Can I have it all?

351
00:22:29,765 --> 00:22:33,166
Sure. It's all yours.

352
00:22:36,138 --> 00:22:38,538
God bless you, man.

353
00:22:59,928 --> 00:23:01,395
Oh, come on.

354
00:23:02,497 --> 00:23:04,362
Come on, come on.

355
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:10,032
Perfect.

356
00:23:11,206 --> 00:23:14,573
Hey, Carl. Do you wanna give all
your money away to a homeless guy?

357
00:23:14,743 --> 00:23:16,233
Yes, yes, I do.

358
00:23:16,411 --> 00:23:17,935
Letting him
burn out your phone...

359
00:23:18,113 --> 00:23:20,377
...so you can't call AAA
when you run out of gas?

360
00:23:20,549 --> 00:23:23,040
That sounds like a fucking great idea!

361
00:23:23,785 --> 00:23:26,049
Why don't you take a stroll
through the hills...

362
00:23:26,221 --> 00:23:29,588
...and get killed by the Manson family?
Don't mind if I do.

363
00:23:46,908 --> 00:23:48,739
Come on, man.

364
00:23:51,246 --> 00:23:54,704
Yes. Since that's my only fucking option.

365
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:14,692
Would you like to carry a 20-pound
container of gas up a giant hill to your car?

366
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:17,964
Oh, could I? Could I really?

367
00:24:19,374 --> 00:24:20,864
That's a good look.

368
00:24:22,777 --> 00:24:26,304
- Hi. Did you just take my picture?
- Maybe.

369
00:24:27,449 --> 00:24:29,610
Did you just run out of gas?

370
00:24:30,085 --> 00:24:31,382
Maybe.

371
00:24:33,088 --> 00:24:37,047
That sucks.
That happened to me last week.

372
00:24:37,225 --> 00:24:39,056
When you were driving
out of your way...

373
00:24:39,227 --> 00:24:42,993
...to drop off a homeless guy who wore out
your battery so you couldn't call AAA?

374
00:24:43,165 --> 00:24:45,963
No. I take it
that's what happened to you.

375
00:24:46,134 --> 00:24:48,534
No. Why would you assume that?

376
00:24:50,438 --> 00:24:51,735
He used up your phone?

377
00:24:51,907 --> 00:24:55,843
Yeah. Apparently he was the most popular
homeless man on the planet.

378
00:24:56,011 --> 00:24:58,605
He was staying connected.
It was good to see.

379
00:24:58,780 --> 00:25:01,772
I'm just glad that I could
be a part of it, really.

380
00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:04,578
- That must feel good.
- Oh, truly, truly.

381
00:25:04,753 --> 00:25:07,244
Yeah. And I'm getting some exercise,
which is cool.

382
00:25:07,923 --> 00:25:09,618
Well, do you need a ride?

383
00:25:10,692 --> 00:25:12,250
On that thing?

384
00:25:22,971 --> 00:25:25,132
Am I going too fast for you?

385
00:25:25,307 --> 00:25:28,174
No. In fact, I think you should go faster.

386
00:25:28,343 --> 00:25:31,107
That way if we crash, at least I'll die.

387
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:34,009
I just don't wanna
be kept alive artificially.

388
00:25:43,391 --> 00:25:48,192
- What are you doing?
- I'm taking a picture. Smile.

389
00:25:49,497 --> 00:25:54,127
- I can't see. I'm blind.
- Me too. Isn't it great? Whoo!

390
00:26:06,548 --> 00:26:10,609
Yeah, that's getting it good. Yep.

391
00:26:12,754 --> 00:26:15,086
- Well, thanks again for the ride.
- No problem.

392
00:26:15,257 --> 00:26:18,488
Hopefully the color will return
to your face sometime soon.

393
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:21,652
- I'm more of a four-wheel kind of guy.
- Really?

394
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:25,322
I never would've guessed that.
You seemed so at ease on two.

395
00:26:27,269 --> 00:26:31,069
- Can I have my helmet back now?
- I'm still wearing it, aren't I?

396
00:26:31,239 --> 00:26:32,399
Yeah.

397
00:26:33,908 --> 00:26:35,739
Thanks.

398
00:26:36,878 --> 00:26:38,038
So you okay?

399
00:26:38,213 --> 00:26:41,410
Yeah, I'm good, unless you wanna
stick around and make out.

400
00:26:41,583 --> 00:26:44,108
- What?
- What did you say?

401
00:26:47,789 --> 00:26:49,347
Hey, I...

402
00:26:54,663 --> 00:26:56,688
Have a good night.

403
00:27:21,990 --> 00:27:23,890
Yes.

404
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:34,768
"Yes always leads to something good.

405
00:27:38,807 --> 00:27:41,002
Never avoid opportunities.

406
00:27:41,176 --> 00:27:43,269
They may come in any form."

407
00:27:47,782 --> 00:27:51,013
- Hello?
- Carl, it's your buddy Norman.

408
00:27:51,186 --> 00:27:54,121
Well, and your boss, but more your
buddy than your boss, right?

409
00:27:54,289 --> 00:27:56,018
I guess.

410
00:27:57,292 --> 00:28:00,159
So look, we're kind of short
on Saturday staff.

411
00:28:00,328 --> 00:28:01,989
Is there any way you could come in?

412
00:28:02,997 --> 00:28:04,225
Sure.

413
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:07,857
Nothing I like better than the inside
of a bank on a beautiful Saturday.

414
00:28:08,036 --> 00:28:12,268
Yeah. Yeah, there really is something
magical about this place.

415
00:28:16,411 --> 00:28:20,370
Would I like to increase the size
of my penis?

416
00:28:21,516 --> 00:28:22,608
Right.

417
00:28:23,184 --> 00:28:24,845
Like I need that.

418
00:28:29,224 --> 00:28:34,093
- Persian wife-finder.
- Hi there. I am Faranoush.

419
00:28:34,262 --> 00:28:36,753
Would you be the man for me?

420
00:28:37,198 --> 00:28:38,961
I guess so.

421
00:28:40,034 --> 00:28:43,333
Excuse me. I'd like to apply
for a small-business loan.

422
00:28:43,505 --> 00:28:44,802
And what's your business?

423
00:28:44,973 --> 00:28:48,204
I bake cakes in the shape
of different celebrities' faces.

424
00:28:48,610 --> 00:28:52,569
- Oh, wow, Mickey Rourke.
- No. It's Bono.

425
00:28:53,114 --> 00:28:55,639
Oh. Yeah, right.

426
00:28:55,817 --> 00:28:58,183
Let's hope it doesn't taste
like Mickey Rourke.

427
00:28:59,554 --> 00:29:00,885
So, what do you think?

428
00:29:04,225 --> 00:29:05,783
I think yes.

429
00:29:11,032 --> 00:29:12,590
Inta-maresting.

430
00:29:13,101 --> 00:29:14,534
Cakes, huh?

431
00:29:14,702 --> 00:29:18,798
Yeah. I just kind of went with my gut
on it, Norm.

432
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:21,638
- You called me Norm.
- Yeah.

433
00:29:21,810 --> 00:29:25,337
- Could that, like, be my nickname?
- Yeah. I guess.

434
00:29:25,513 --> 00:29:30,348
Oh, nice. I like your style.
Car. That could be yours.

435
00:29:30,552 --> 00:29:32,417
Yeah. Carl's pretty short already, but...

436
00:29:32,587 --> 00:29:34,782
But it's the kind of dazzle
we need around here.

437
00:29:34,956 --> 00:29:36,821
- Yeah.
- And you know what I did?

438
00:29:36,991 --> 00:29:38,015
What?

439
00:29:38,193 --> 00:29:42,755
That Demko thing really chapped my ass.
I marched upstairs and I told the big guns:

440
00:29:42,931 --> 00:29:46,526
"Carl gets promoted in lieu of Demko,
or along with Demko...

441
00:29:46,701 --> 00:29:49,135
...whichever, or I walk."

442
00:29:49,304 --> 00:29:51,568
Really? What did they say?

443
00:29:51,739 --> 00:29:55,470
Well, they were quite attracted to the me
walking option, you know, for a moment.

444
00:29:55,643 --> 00:29:57,975
- But then I threw that off the table.
- Good move.

445
00:29:58,146 --> 00:30:01,604
And they said if you started to show
some initiative, I could promote you.

446
00:30:02,383 --> 00:30:03,407
And?

447
00:30:03,618 --> 00:30:04,949
- Well, you're doing it.
- Yeah?

448
00:30:05,119 --> 00:30:06,882
- Yeah, the whole cake thing.
- Yeah.

449
00:30:07,055 --> 00:30:08,784
- You're making up nicknames.
- Okay.

450
00:30:08,957 --> 00:30:10,822
Know what?
I called Demko this morning...

451
00:30:10,992 --> 00:30:13,290
...to ask if he could work,
and know what he said?

452
00:30:13,461 --> 00:30:15,656
- No.
- How did you know that?

453
00:30:15,830 --> 00:30:16,854
He's not here.

454
00:30:17,031 --> 00:30:19,397
- Yeah, but you are, Car.
- Yeah.

455
00:30:19,567 --> 00:30:22,559
And that's why I'm gonna
give the job to you.

456
00:30:22,937 --> 00:30:26,236
Norm, that's amazing.
Oh, my God. Thank you.

457
00:30:26,407 --> 00:30:30,434
Nice little raise in it for you too.
Bump up your salary to 65.

458
00:30:30,612 --> 00:30:33,445
- Thousand?
- Of course, thousand.

459
00:30:33,615 --> 00:30:36,482
Come on, let's step this thing
up a notch, Broseph.

460
00:30:38,386 --> 00:30:39,410
See what I did there?

461
00:30:39,587 --> 00:30:44,889
I joined "bro" with "Joseph." Broseph.
Pretty cool, huh?

462
00:30:45,393 --> 00:30:46,883
Very cool, Norm.

463
00:30:50,965 --> 00:30:53,957
I have been such a dick and a douche.

464
00:30:54,402 --> 00:30:56,768
More of a douche
than a dick, probably...

465
00:30:56,938 --> 00:30:59,736
...but I'm sorry. I should have been there.
I mean, really.

466
00:31:00,008 --> 00:31:04,570
- You're preaching to the choir, Carl.
- I'm telling you, man, things are different.

467
00:31:04,746 --> 00:31:07,271
Okay. Wait, so wait.
You have to say yes to everything?

468
00:31:07,448 --> 00:31:11,214
Yeah, exactly. It's like you said:
I wasn't open to stuff, and now I am...

469
00:31:11,386 --> 00:31:15,413
...and things are changing for me.
It's like the era of yes has begun.

470
00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:18,559
All right. Look, gets you out of the house,
I'm all for it.

471
00:31:18,726 --> 00:31:20,990
Excuse me.
Could we get another round of drinks?

472
00:31:21,162 --> 00:31:23,027
And actually, we're gonna start a tab...

473
00:31:23,197 --> 00:31:26,166
...and our good friend here, Carl,
will be taking care of it.

474
00:31:27,869 --> 00:31:32,465
- Well, you're okay with that, right, buddy?
- Yes. Yes, I am.

475
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,005
Okay.

476
00:31:38,046 --> 00:31:42,346
I should be prepping my case for Monday,
but I cannot miss this.

477
00:31:42,517 --> 00:31:45,714
Hey, you, another bump of hot sauce.

478
00:31:47,188 --> 00:31:51,215
Boy, you guys are really
into this yes thing.

479
00:31:55,763 --> 00:31:57,162
Argh!

480
00:31:59,901 --> 00:32:01,334
Okay, okay.

481
00:32:21,589 --> 00:32:22,749
He did it.

482
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:34,065
Drinks on me.

483
00:32:34,936 --> 00:32:36,130
Crazy, man.

484
00:32:37,538 --> 00:32:38,903
Carl, that was so awesome.

485
00:32:39,073 --> 00:32:41,541
- Okay.
- Excuse me. Could I...

486
00:32:41,709 --> 00:32:43,540
Absolutely.

487
00:32:43,711 --> 00:32:47,909
I don't think that's what she was
asking for, but all right.

488
00:32:50,885 --> 00:32:52,853
Was I chewing gum before?

489
00:32:53,021 --> 00:32:55,546
Hey. What do you
think you're doing, asshole?

490
00:32:55,723 --> 00:32:58,385
Easy, easy. It was a little
misunderstanding, okay?

491
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:03,758
I'm just saying yes to life, homes.
You gotta say yes to life.

492
00:33:03,931 --> 00:33:07,094
I made a sacred "conevant."

493
00:33:07,602 --> 00:33:09,229
That sounded naughty.

494
00:33:09,871 --> 00:33:12,669
- I think you and I need to step outside.
- No. God, no.

495
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:16,173
Okay, it's okay.
I got this. I got this.

496
00:33:16,577 --> 00:33:19,171
Okay. But if I win...

497
00:33:19,347 --> 00:33:23,215
...I get to take that pretty
girl of yours to a ball...

498
00:33:23,384 --> 00:33:25,716
...because she deserves that.

499
00:33:25,887 --> 00:33:29,345
Every pretty girl
deserves to go to a ball.

500
00:33:30,091 --> 00:33:32,082
That is so nice.

501
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:36,988
Oh, shit.

502
00:33:40,068 --> 00:33:43,731
All right. He punched me
right in the face, man.

503
00:33:43,905 --> 00:33:46,533
- Don't worry. I got your back.
- You don't have anybody's.

504
00:33:46,708 --> 00:33:48,403
I'm sorry, man. It's all our fault.

505
00:33:48,576 --> 00:33:51,306
- I haven't fighted in a
fight since grade 7. - I know.

506
00:33:51,479 --> 00:33:53,413
Hey. Are we gonna fight or what?

507
00:33:53,581 --> 00:33:57,142
Yeah, we're gonna fight.
We're gonna fight, all right. Okay?

508
00:33:57,318 --> 00:33:59,582
You want some, huh, more?

509
00:33:59,754 --> 00:34:03,121
Because I am open for business, okay?
Oh, where'd I go?

510
00:34:03,758 --> 00:34:05,350
Oh, where'd I go?

511
00:34:05,526 --> 00:34:07,619
Yeah, how do you fight
what you can't see?

512
00:34:08,896 --> 00:34:12,229
Did you see The Legend of Billy Jack?

513
00:34:12,633 --> 00:34:15,033
Because I'm gonna take this foot...

514
00:34:15,203 --> 00:34:18,969
...and I'm gonna whop you
on that side of your face...

515
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:21,734
...and there's not a goddamn thing
you can do about it.

516
00:34:23,644 --> 00:34:26,044
Just don't break my teeth off
on the curb, okay?

517
00:34:26,214 --> 00:34:30,082
But let's really sell this.
Give them a show.

518
00:34:30,251 --> 00:34:31,275
What?

519
00:34:31,452 --> 00:34:36,253
First, we have to establish
the ground rules.

520
00:34:36,424 --> 00:34:39,791
And the ground rules are
there are no ground rules.

521
00:34:44,198 --> 00:34:47,065
Idiot. I'm the wrong guy.

522
00:34:47,368 --> 00:34:49,996
Well, maybe you need to start
being the right guy.

523
00:34:50,171 --> 00:34:51,695
That's why you got punched out...

524
00:34:51,873 --> 00:34:55,434
...because you got the wrong attitude
right out of the gate.

525
00:34:55,610 --> 00:34:57,009
I'm over here, dickhole.

526
00:34:57,545 --> 00:35:01,140
Oh, my God. That's so funny.

527
00:35:01,449 --> 00:35:03,440
You're a complete...

528
00:35:04,719 --> 00:35:05,743
You all right?

529
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:08,013
I almost blocked it.
Didn't get there in time.

530
00:35:08,189 --> 00:35:09,918
Okay, we're done.
We've been drinking.

531
00:35:10,091 --> 00:35:12,082
- He's really been drinking.
- Seriously, man.

532
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:14,125
I'm glad we had this experience.

533
00:35:14,462 --> 00:35:19,695
- I think we both grew from it. Call me.
- You asshole.

534
00:35:21,235 --> 00:35:26,537
- We really did.
- Yeah. We did, bud.

535
00:35:29,744 --> 00:35:32,178
She's never gonna go to a ball.

536
00:35:32,346 --> 00:35:35,144
No. No, she's not.

537
00:36:06,814 --> 00:36:10,875
- Okay. Tillie, there you are.
- Hi, Carl.

538
00:36:11,052 --> 00:36:12,451
What can I do for you?

539
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:15,953
Well, I was wondering if you could help me
put up some shelves.

540
00:36:16,958 --> 00:36:18,550
Oh, really?

541
00:36:24,799 --> 00:36:30,897
Okay. That should just about do it.

542
00:36:31,072 --> 00:36:34,473
- I'll see you later, Tillie.
- That was wonderful, Carl.

543
00:36:35,409 --> 00:36:38,207
Oh, not so fast.

544
00:36:38,813 --> 00:36:40,212
What are you doing?

545
00:36:41,082 --> 00:36:45,018
- Oh, darn, I forgot to go to the bank.
- Oh, that's okay.

546
00:36:45,186 --> 00:36:47,746
I'm getting so forgetful.

547
00:36:47,922 --> 00:36:50,982
- It happens with age.
- Don't worry about it.

548
00:36:51,158 --> 00:36:53,956
I am gonna have to repay you somehow.

549
00:36:54,128 --> 00:36:58,224
Oh, just doing a favor for a neighbor
is good enough for me.

550
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:01,958
You are so handsome.

551
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:06,667
How come I never see you
with a girl over there?

552
00:37:06,841 --> 00:37:12,507
Well, I'm just... I'm not in
a serious thing, but I am dating.

553
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:15,342
- Would you like a release?
- I'm sorry?

554
00:37:15,516 --> 00:37:18,349
You know, a sexual release?

555
00:37:18,552 --> 00:37:19,883
Uh...

556
00:37:20,821 --> 00:37:25,121
- What do I do here?
- Oh, you don't have to do anything, Carl.

557
00:37:25,293 --> 00:37:28,956
You just lay back
and I will take care of everything.

558
00:37:29,130 --> 00:37:32,497
I don't know what to say here.
I'm stumped. I'm baffled.

559
00:37:32,667 --> 00:37:35,727
I don't know if I'm gonna be able
to say yes to this one, Till.

560
00:37:35,903 --> 00:37:39,168
- Oh, come on.
- But thanks for the offer and the image.

561
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:44,300
And I've got this thing I gotta do,
so I'll be seeing you.

562
00:37:45,546 --> 00:37:48,606
In my nightmares.

563
00:37:49,984 --> 00:37:52,248
Oh, come on, give me a break.

564
00:37:53,254 --> 00:37:56,451
Terrence said this would happen if I said no.
That's ridiculous.

565
00:37:56,624 --> 00:38:01,357
Get out of there.
If I wanna say no, I'll say no!

566
00:38:15,443 --> 00:38:16,467
Nice dog.

567
00:38:28,155 --> 00:38:32,524
Just relax. I'll handle this.

568
00:38:38,232 --> 00:38:39,790
Oh, God!

569
00:38:40,901 --> 00:38:44,564
Oh, God! Oh, no. Oh, my...

570
00:38:45,373 --> 00:38:46,465
Wow.

571
00:38:46,774 --> 00:38:49,004
That... Oh...

572
00:38:50,544 --> 00:38:52,011
That is a...

573
00:38:52,179 --> 00:38:53,976
How are you doing that? Ay!

574
00:39:00,688 --> 00:39:04,215
"Costume party. Come as your favorite
Harry Potter character."

575
00:39:04,392 --> 00:39:05,416
You got it, Norm.

576
00:39:53,441 --> 00:39:54,465
Hi.

577
00:39:56,644 --> 00:40:00,136
Really? I've always wanted
to try it. Yeah.

578
00:40:00,314 --> 00:40:03,181
So I can expect delivery anytime
between 8 a.m. and 5:30?

579
00:40:04,552 --> 00:40:06,486
Hello. Wondering if you had a moment...

580
00:40:06,654 --> 00:40:09,521
- ...to discuss the Church of Jesus Christ.
- Yeah, come on in.

581
00:40:10,691 --> 00:40:13,888
- Buttercup Girls.
- Buttercup Girls.

582
00:40:15,563 --> 00:40:17,394
Yeah. All right.

583
00:40:20,334 --> 00:40:24,031
Hey. It's really working. Ah!

584
00:40:28,576 --> 00:40:32,012
It's beautiful, man. It's beautiful.

585
00:40:32,179 --> 00:40:35,740
I do wanna take guitar lessons.
I do wanna learn how to fly.

586
00:40:35,916 --> 00:40:37,577
Yes, I would like to learn Korean.

587
00:40:37,751 --> 00:40:44,748
I would understand

588
00:40:46,927 --> 00:40:48,417
All right, now I got it.

589
00:40:52,399 --> 00:40:53,661
Whoa.

590
00:41:07,248 --> 00:41:09,409
What did he call me?

591
00:41:15,022 --> 00:41:16,046
Homeless.

592
00:41:17,258 --> 00:41:19,055
Come and get it.

593
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:21,228
There you are. You want some?

594
00:41:21,428 --> 00:41:22,759
He never listens.

595
00:41:24,098 --> 00:41:25,122
Yeah.

596
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:29,233
I wanna start an
organic-fertilizer distribution business.

597
00:41:33,374 --> 00:41:34,432
Next.

598
00:41:35,209 --> 00:41:39,077
- Wanna see a... Oh, sorry.
- You know what? I'd love to.

599
00:41:39,246 --> 00:41:40,941
Way to stick in there.

600
00:42:00,267 --> 00:42:01,598
There you go.

601
00:42:01,835 --> 00:42:04,201
Hey. I came.

602
00:42:04,772 --> 00:42:06,467
Great.

603
00:42:07,841 --> 00:42:09,103
Yeah.

604
00:42:10,911 --> 00:42:12,606
Rolling Rock, please.

605
00:42:15,516 --> 00:42:18,349
- From the dawn of time...
- In the netherworld.

606
00:42:20,154 --> 00:42:21,815
There was a band.

607
00:42:21,989 --> 00:42:24,014
Oh, yes, there was.

608
00:42:24,658 --> 00:42:26,057
And we were that band.

609
00:42:26,227 --> 00:42:28,024
Yes, we were.

610
00:42:28,229 --> 00:42:29,958
And that band made rock 'n' roll.

611
00:42:30,130 --> 00:42:31,688
Oh, yes, they did.

612
00:42:32,499 --> 00:42:36,959
And that band ate arame
and other sea vegetables.

613
00:42:37,137 --> 00:42:38,570
Yeah.

614
00:42:38,739 --> 00:42:41,799
And that band was rad.

615
00:42:44,845 --> 00:42:49,839
Hello, Jake, Penelope,
Rodrigo, Phillip, Zachary.

616
00:42:50,050 --> 00:42:52,917
- We are Munchausen by Proxy.
- You're kidding me.

617
00:42:53,087 --> 00:42:55,214
I should have been the one
To break up with you

618
00:42:55,389 --> 00:42:57,323
You said, "Who are you?"

619
00:42:57,491 --> 00:42:59,322
Who are you?

620
00:42:59,493 --> 00:43:04,897
I wanna snap your neck and spit on you
You said, "Who are you?"

621
00:43:05,065 --> 00:43:06,930
Who are you?

622
00:43:07,301 --> 00:43:12,364
If I got a call that said you were dead
You said, "Who are you?"

623
00:43:12,539 --> 00:43:14,564
Who are you?

624
00:43:14,742 --> 00:43:19,509
I'd shrug my shoulders, and I'd say whatevs
You said, "Who are you?"

625
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:22,171
Who are you?

626
00:43:22,349 --> 00:43:26,786
Hey, did you ever meet my friend Ian?
He's a computer hacker.

627
00:43:26,954 --> 00:43:30,412
He helped me erase your MySpace page.

628
00:43:30,591 --> 00:43:34,960
And your band's MySpace page.
And your Facebook page.

629
00:43:35,129 --> 00:43:37,029
Happy networking, asshole.

630
00:43:53,314 --> 00:43:57,876
Don't call me past 11 p.m.
It won't happen again

631
00:43:58,052 --> 00:43:59,917
Happened once, it happened twice

632
00:44:00,087 --> 00:44:03,750
It happened three times,
Maybe four times, maybe five times, maybe

633
00:44:03,924 --> 00:44:06,859
Maybe it happened six times
But it won't happen a seventh time

634
00:44:07,027 --> 00:44:08,927
No, no, no, no

635
00:44:12,533 --> 00:44:16,560
I'm not your late night booty call

636
00:44:18,439 --> 00:44:20,930
Whore no more

637
00:44:21,108 --> 00:44:26,011
Don't call me past 11 p.m.
It won't happen again

638
00:44:26,613 --> 00:44:28,342
You can call me at 10:59

639
00:44:28,515 --> 00:44:33,043
But don't call me at 11
'Cause that's my rule now

640
00:44:43,430 --> 00:44:45,921
Can I get a water?

641
00:44:50,604 --> 00:44:53,767
Hey. Out-of-gas make-out guy.

642
00:44:53,941 --> 00:44:57,342
Did we make out? Oh, right, we did.
Now I remember.

643
00:44:57,511 --> 00:45:00,275
- What are you doing here?
- I know. Is this crazy or what?

644
00:45:00,447 --> 00:45:02,415
- It's so crazy.
- Yeah.

645
00:45:02,583 --> 00:45:05,143
- Are you stalking me?
- No. I would never do that.

646
00:45:05,319 --> 00:45:08,288
By the way, your new living-room
furniture looks great from the yard.

647
00:45:09,656 --> 00:45:14,320
- Hey, great gig or whatever, you know.
- Thanks.

648
00:45:14,495 --> 00:45:17,862
Yeah. Strong lyrics.
You just make that stuff up?

649
00:45:18,031 --> 00:45:20,864
- It comes from personal experience.
- Cool.

650
00:45:21,034 --> 00:45:22,331
You want a drink?

651
00:45:22,536 --> 00:45:25,699
Oh, I can't. I have to wake up early.

652
00:45:25,873 --> 00:45:29,036
- So I have to go, but...
- Oh, really?

653
00:45:31,311 --> 00:45:33,871
But you can walk me to my scooter.

654
00:45:35,282 --> 00:45:37,682
I teach a jogging photo group...

655
00:45:37,851 --> 00:45:42,254
...for people who want to both exercise
and practice photography.

656
00:45:42,423 --> 00:45:44,823
Oh, yeah,
that's getting very popular now.

657
00:45:44,992 --> 00:45:48,985
It's in Griffith Park and we do a loop.
It's about five miles.

658
00:45:49,163 --> 00:45:51,461
It's at 6 a.m.

659
00:45:51,632 --> 00:45:55,898
Wow. I haven't been up at 6 a.m.
in, like, never.

660
00:45:56,069 --> 00:46:00,199
- That's early.
- Yeah, but it makes for amazing pictures.

661
00:46:01,575 --> 00:46:03,008
Okay, so you're in a band...

662
00:46:03,177 --> 00:46:06,271
...you do the jogging photography,
what else?

663
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:08,573
Whatever I want.

664
00:46:08,749 --> 00:46:12,116
I volunteer at a shelter.
I paint a little bit.

665
00:46:12,286 --> 00:46:14,720
Yeah, that's cool.
I've done some charity work.

666
00:46:14,888 --> 00:46:17,152
And some nude modeling, FYI.

667
00:46:18,459 --> 00:46:21,519
Good to know, if, you know,
if I ever need to...

668
00:46:23,464 --> 00:46:27,298
So anyway, my answer is yes.
I'd be happy to go out with you.

669
00:46:27,468 --> 00:46:29,561
I didn't ask you out.

670
00:46:29,736 --> 00:46:31,931
Could have fooled me
with that modeling comment.

671
00:46:32,105 --> 00:46:33,504
You said that.

672
00:46:33,674 --> 00:46:36,302
Well, whoever said it,
it made me very uncomfortable.

673
00:46:38,679 --> 00:46:41,204
Hey, why don't you
come to my class tomorrow?

674
00:46:41,381 --> 00:46:45,442
Why don't you stop smothering me?
Seriously. It's way too much too soon.

675
00:46:45,619 --> 00:46:46,813
Yeah, I'd love to.

676
00:46:48,388 --> 00:46:52,290
Okay. I'll see you tomorrow...

677
00:46:52,459 --> 00:46:55,724
- Carl.
- Allison.

678
00:47:12,546 --> 00:47:13,570
Yeah, Rooney?

679
00:47:13,747 --> 00:47:15,476
Yo, Carl, hitting the clubs.

680
00:47:15,649 --> 00:47:19,210
Got a case of Red Bull.
Gonna pull an all-nighter. You down?

681
00:47:19,386 --> 00:47:20,944
Yeah.

682
00:47:28,529 --> 00:47:30,963
Okay, guys, everybody ready?
Cameras loaded?

683
00:47:31,131 --> 00:47:32,393
- Allison?
- Yeah?

684
00:47:32,566 --> 00:47:34,431
Do we need to use a flash?

685
00:47:34,601 --> 00:47:36,432
Not when the sun's up, Reggie.

686
00:47:44,878 --> 00:47:48,109
Beautiful night, guys.
You take it to the limit, and I respect that.

687
00:47:48,282 --> 00:47:51,080
Hit me on the cell this week.
Let's do it again.

688
00:47:51,251 --> 00:47:55,312
Carl, if somebody asked me to
describe tonight, I would just go, "Ow!"

689
00:47:55,489 --> 00:47:58,549
Back at you, Roon. Lee, I hardly know you,
but I feel comfortable.

690
00:47:58,725 --> 00:48:02,661
Look how close I'm getting.
Hey, Allison, it's me, Carl. I'm here.

691
00:48:03,430 --> 00:48:05,455
Allison, I'm here.

692
00:48:07,134 --> 00:48:08,294
Allison.

693
00:48:09,670 --> 00:48:12,662
Hey. Who were those guys?

694
00:48:12,839 --> 00:48:16,138
That's Rooney and my friend Lee.
He's a nurse. I was making fun of him.

695
00:48:16,310 --> 00:48:19,211
We hit a couple raves last night.
It was totally off the hook.

696
00:48:19,379 --> 00:48:21,677
- You seem a little hyper.
- Had a couple Red Bulls.

697
00:48:21,848 --> 00:48:25,579
Ever had Red Bull? I never had Red Bull.
Had Red Bull last night. I like Red Bull.

698
00:48:25,752 --> 00:48:27,617
I got a new necklace. Glows in the dark.

699
00:48:27,788 --> 00:48:30,154
Can't really see it right now,
unless you do this.

700
00:48:30,324 --> 00:48:33,760
That's really something. Doesn't Red Bull
make you crash pretty hard?

701
00:48:33,927 --> 00:48:36,657
No, no, no. No, no. I don't think so. No.

702
00:48:36,830 --> 00:48:39,822
No. Hey, after we jog,
we should get a Red Bull.

703
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,400
You and I could get a Red Bull.
We could share.

704
00:48:42,569 --> 00:48:44,161
- Okay, that'd be fu...
- Red Bull.

705
00:48:44,338 --> 00:48:45,464
- That sounds...
- Red Bull.

706
00:48:45,672 --> 00:48:46,866
- I think I'd...
- Red Bull.

707
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:49,338
- I'd really...
- Red Bull.

708
00:48:49,509 --> 00:48:51,602
Red Bull.

709
00:48:52,179 --> 00:48:56,843
Okay. A lot of energy. I like it.
Everybody, this is Carl.

710
00:48:57,017 --> 00:48:59,417
- Carl, this is everybody.
- Hey, everybody.

711
00:49:00,220 --> 00:49:03,781
Come on. Let's get into shipshape.

712
00:49:10,764 --> 00:49:12,356
Oh, it's a good one.

713
00:49:14,468 --> 00:49:15,457
Hold that.

714
00:49:16,803 --> 00:49:17,929
Got it.

715
00:49:28,048 --> 00:49:30,107
Hey, Carl, you okay?

716
00:49:32,853 --> 00:49:34,844
Hold it right there.

717
00:49:50,170 --> 00:49:51,660
That's good.

718
00:49:52,906 --> 00:49:57,900
I can't put my finger on you.
You're kind of unpredictable.

719
00:49:58,278 --> 00:50:00,212
Kind of mysterious.

720
00:50:00,380 --> 00:50:01,506
You know, listen.

721
00:50:01,682 --> 00:50:05,118
I like to keep it fresh. I like to
live it up. I like to mix it up.

722
00:50:05,285 --> 00:50:07,617
If that doesn't jive with you,
we should end this.

723
00:50:07,788 --> 00:50:09,653
I love that.

724
00:50:09,823 --> 00:50:13,020
I don't know how people go through
life with the same boring routine.

725
00:50:13,193 --> 00:50:15,252
- Just shoot me.
- I know. Right in the face.

726
00:50:15,429 --> 00:50:18,865
Seriously, I dated this guy and I was
astounded at how content he was...

727
00:50:19,032 --> 00:50:21,694
...just living his life
in this closed-off little box.

728
00:50:21,868 --> 00:50:25,531
I know. It's so frustrating. I just
wanna grab these people and shake them.

729
00:50:25,706 --> 00:50:29,437
Say, "Wake up, you. You're missing
out on a little thing called life."

730
00:50:29,609 --> 00:50:31,338
- That's so true.
- Yeah.

731
00:50:32,212 --> 00:50:35,272
So, what happened
to closed-off-little-box boy?

732
00:50:35,449 --> 00:50:38,714
It just didn't work out.
It's a long story.

733
00:50:38,885 --> 00:50:42,286
Yeah? Same story you were
singing about last night?

734
00:50:43,123 --> 00:50:44,715
Might be.

735
00:50:45,625 --> 00:50:48,594
Closed-off-little-box boy, tender topic.
Probe no further.

736
00:50:48,762 --> 00:50:52,027
Okay, if you must know,
we lived together.

737
00:50:52,199 --> 00:50:55,191
I thought he was it, the one,
or whatever.

738
00:50:55,368 --> 00:50:58,997
And then surprise, he ended it,
out of nowhere for no reason.

739
00:50:59,172 --> 00:51:00,537
Gone, never saw him again.

740
00:51:01,408 --> 00:51:05,105
Wow. That's rough. I'm sorry.

741
00:51:05,579 --> 00:51:08,639
Next time you should warn me
about the length of the story, though.

742
00:51:08,815 --> 00:51:09,907
Kind of dragged on.

743
00:51:10,083 --> 00:51:12,415
- I'll work on that.
- Yeah, just trim the fat.

744
00:51:12,819 --> 00:51:17,119
Ooh! Jeez. That was very healthy.

745
00:51:28,368 --> 00:51:30,836
She's spontaneous. She's ballsy.

746
00:51:31,004 --> 00:51:33,472
She has no clue what she's doing
and she doesn't care.

747
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:35,130
She's the complete opposite of me.

748
00:51:35,308 --> 00:51:37,606
Carl, could you please pass the Cholula?

749
00:51:37,778 --> 00:51:39,746
Sure, Faranoush.

750
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:42,113
How did you two meet again?

751
00:51:42,282 --> 00:51:45,945
Persianwifefinder.com. It's pretty cool.
You should check it out.

752
00:51:46,119 --> 00:51:48,519
- I'm engaged.
- Oh, yeah.

753
00:51:48,688 --> 00:51:51,088
Should you talk about Allison
in front of Faranoush?

754
00:51:51,258 --> 00:51:54,125
It's okay, man. We just met.
She knows it's not exclusive.

755
00:51:54,294 --> 00:51:58,128
- Besides, she's totally not my type.
- I can hear you.

756
00:51:58,298 --> 00:51:59,697
Sorry, Faranoush.

757
00:52:00,300 --> 00:52:04,100
Anyway, I never would've met Allison
if I hadn't said yes to the homeless guy.

758
00:52:04,271 --> 00:52:06,432
You wouldn't be on a date
with a strange woman.

759
00:52:06,606 --> 00:52:09,006
- No offense, Faranoush.
- None taken.

760
00:52:09,176 --> 00:52:12,270
I didn't realize
I was dealing with a no man.

761
00:52:12,445 --> 00:52:15,972
No, I think it's great.
Throw this away for me, will you?

762
00:52:19,052 --> 00:52:21,350
- Hey, honey.
- Hey.

763
00:52:23,223 --> 00:52:27,455
- Lucy. Faranoush, Lucy. Lucy, Faranoush.
- Hello.

764
00:52:29,563 --> 00:52:31,360
So my friends are being really lame...

765
00:52:31,531 --> 00:52:34,694
...and nobody's offered
to throw me a bridal shower.

766
00:52:34,868 --> 00:52:37,234
Hey, I have an idea.

767
00:52:37,571 --> 00:52:40,472
Carl, would you like to throw Lucy
a bridal shower?

768
00:52:40,841 --> 00:52:43,742
Yeah. Sure.

769
00:52:43,910 --> 00:52:46,140
Why not? That'd be great.
Yeah, I'd love that.

770
00:52:46,313 --> 00:52:47,871
- Problem solved.
- Yeah.

771
00:52:53,687 --> 00:52:55,780
- Really?
- Yeah.

772
00:52:55,956 --> 00:52:58,982
Well, thanks, Carl.

773
00:52:59,359 --> 00:53:03,420
Thanks, that's really sweet.

774
00:53:03,864 --> 00:53:05,729
- That's great.
- That is sweet, Carl.

775
00:53:05,899 --> 00:53:07,890
Thanks, Faranoush.

776
00:53:08,168 --> 00:53:10,932
Oh, I forgot, I gotta pick up
costumes for me and Allison.

777
00:53:11,104 --> 00:53:12,366
Costumes for what?

778
00:53:13,874 --> 00:53:16,468
Expelliarmus! Just kidding.

779
00:53:16,643 --> 00:53:18,736
That's okay. I blocked it
and deflected it back.

780
00:53:18,912 --> 00:53:22,712
Oh. Kaching!
Wow. Cool costume, my man.

781
00:53:22,883 --> 00:53:25,443
The only one they had left
was for toddlers.

782
00:53:25,619 --> 00:53:28,884
This is Allison
and her wand made from a sequoia.

783
00:53:29,923 --> 00:53:31,151
- Hi.
- You must be Norman.

784
00:53:31,324 --> 00:53:35,488
Yes, nice to meet you.
Thanks for coming. Come in.

785
00:53:36,897 --> 00:53:39,491
Yeah, we've got, well, drinks,
you know...

786
00:53:39,666 --> 00:53:41,293
...chips, dips...

787
00:53:41,468 --> 00:53:44,801
...and good people, just like you two.

788
00:53:45,639 --> 00:53:46,936
- Thanks.
- Pace yourselves.

789
00:53:47,107 --> 00:53:48,836
It's gonna be a crazy night.

790
00:53:54,547 --> 00:53:57,243
- Get in there, play the zone.
- Come on.

791
00:53:57,417 --> 00:53:59,942
- Good dip, huh, H.P?
- Mm.

792
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:04,284
Got tons of it at Costco. You see,
I've got an exclusive membership card.

793
00:54:04,457 --> 00:54:07,426
And with that card, I get access
to the whole place.

794
00:54:07,594 --> 00:54:11,189
I can buy large quantities of
anything at discount prices.

795
00:54:11,564 --> 00:54:13,725
Can't anyone get one of those cards?

796
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:17,863
No, don't think so. But I can
talk to someone, if you'd like.

797
00:54:18,638 --> 00:54:21,232
- Yeah, put in a good word for us.
- That would be great.

798
00:54:22,943 --> 00:54:25,878
Feels strange to be going home,
doesn't it?

799
00:54:26,212 --> 00:54:29,739
"I'm not going home, not really."

800
00:54:32,585 --> 00:54:34,382
Oh, bye.

801
00:54:38,892 --> 00:54:42,350
Alrighty, gang. Who wants
to watch Chamber of Secrets?

802
00:54:50,971 --> 00:54:54,031
- Well, thanks for coming, guys.
- So nice to meet you.

803
00:54:54,207 --> 00:54:56,732
Good to meet you, too.
Thank you. And hey.

804
00:54:56,910 --> 00:55:00,141
That's right. Come in. I'll go in.

805
00:55:00,313 --> 00:55:04,113
Keep your hand there like in a shake.
The other hand goes around for a hug.

806
00:55:04,284 --> 00:55:07,617
- Yeah. Tap it.
- Thanks for walking me through that.

807
00:55:07,787 --> 00:55:09,584
- That's all right.
- Bye.

808
00:55:09,756 --> 00:55:12,850
Okay, guys,
all aboard the Hogwarts Express.

809
00:55:13,026 --> 00:55:15,085
Next stop, Azkaban.

810
00:55:23,536 --> 00:55:24,798
Hey.

811
00:55:25,205 --> 00:55:27,366
Do you wanna drive?

812
00:55:33,646 --> 00:55:37,047
- Hey, you're getting better.
- Yeah, not bad, huh?

813
00:55:38,385 --> 00:55:40,683
Whoa. Yep, I got it.

814
00:55:46,459 --> 00:55:48,757
I got an idea.

815
00:55:54,434 --> 00:55:58,734
- We can't do this.
- Why? You scared?

816
00:56:01,808 --> 00:56:06,177
Hurry. Somebody's coming.
And I think I see something. Hurry.

817
00:56:09,082 --> 00:56:13,985
- This is crazy.
- I know, but it's great.

818
00:56:39,979 --> 00:56:42,539
This is unreal.

819
00:56:42,782 --> 00:56:44,909
I couldn't agree more.

820
00:56:55,128 --> 00:56:56,459
Ooh

821
00:56:58,765 --> 00:57:00,255
Ooh

822
00:57:06,005 --> 00:57:07,302
Ooh

823
00:57:22,755 --> 00:57:26,589
You know, I've never let anyone
drive my scooter before.

824
00:57:27,227 --> 00:57:30,924
I've never let anyone kiss me
on the stage of the Hollywood Bowl before.

825
00:57:55,355 --> 00:57:57,414
Good evening, Los Angeles.

826
00:57:57,590 --> 00:58:00,787
Please welcome to the Hollywood Bowl
Munchausen by Proxy.

827
00:58:02,428 --> 00:58:04,089
I'm your biggest fan. Bang!

828
00:58:04,264 --> 00:58:05,458
I killed her.

829
00:58:06,966 --> 00:58:08,228
I'm a somebody.

830
00:58:09,435 --> 00:58:11,630
I don't know about that.

831
00:58:11,804 --> 00:58:14,398
- Come on, you gotta have creepy fans.
- I don't think so.

832
00:58:14,574 --> 00:58:17,771
- We don't have that much of a following.
- What are you talking about?

833
00:58:17,944 --> 00:58:20,674
Rodrigo and the guys at the bar.
They can't be trusted.

834
00:58:20,847 --> 00:58:25,841
There's me and my friends. That makes
eight or nine very unstable people.

835
00:58:26,019 --> 00:58:30,183
- How many people can this place even hold?
- Like 17,000.

836
00:58:30,356 --> 00:58:35,225
So each one of us invites 1800
of our closest friends.

837
00:58:35,395 --> 00:58:38,330
No need. I know our music
isn't that mainstream.

838
00:58:38,498 --> 00:58:40,329
- What?
- I love doing it.

839
00:58:40,833 --> 00:58:42,300
It's like my photography.

840
00:58:42,468 --> 00:58:44,936
I know there isn't that much
demand for photographs...

841
00:58:45,104 --> 00:58:46,696
...taken while running, but...

842
00:58:46,873 --> 00:58:49,000
I wasn't gonna say anything.

843
00:58:49,175 --> 00:58:52,702
You know, who cares?
The world's a playground.

844
00:58:52,879 --> 00:58:54,471
You know that when you're a kid...

845
00:58:54,647 --> 00:58:57,275
...but somewhere along the way,
everyone forgets it.

846
00:58:58,084 --> 00:59:00,018
I love your music.

847
00:59:00,286 --> 00:59:03,119
Anybody can take a
photo standing still.

848
00:59:04,090 --> 00:59:07,685
- Hey. What are you doing?
- Oh, shit.

849
00:59:07,860 --> 00:59:09,521
- Stop.
- Stopping.

850
00:59:09,696 --> 00:59:11,994
- Come on, Carl, run.
- Thanks.

851
00:59:12,165 --> 00:59:13,564
- Wait right there.
- You got it.

852
00:59:13,733 --> 00:59:15,496
- Down on the ground.
- Whatever you say.

853
00:59:15,668 --> 00:59:20,105
- Carl, what are you doing? Let's go.
- All right. I can't please everyone.

854
00:59:23,276 --> 00:59:24,504
Run!

855
00:59:24,777 --> 00:59:26,472
Hello, everybody.

856
00:59:26,646 --> 00:59:32,084
A little vitamin C. Keep your
strength up. I will be right with you.

857
00:59:32,252 --> 00:59:34,413
- Pass those out, will you?
- Sure.

858
00:59:38,825 --> 00:59:41,521
- Lee?
- Hey.

859
00:59:41,694 --> 00:59:44,162
What up, my brizzo?

860
00:59:45,498 --> 00:59:48,592
- That's not right, is it?
- Carl, I need you for a second.

861
00:59:49,702 --> 00:59:52,068
Can you hang on a minute, Lee?

862
00:59:53,506 --> 00:59:55,565
What's going on, Norm?

863
00:59:55,742 --> 00:59:57,573
Something's going down on a big scale.

864
00:59:57,744 --> 01:00:01,703
Guy from Corporate's here. Don't look.
He wants to talk to you.

865
01:00:01,881 --> 01:00:05,044
I think it's about all those loans
you've been approving.

866
01:00:05,685 --> 01:00:08,449
Well, we had a nice run.

867
01:00:08,621 --> 01:00:10,885
I might get shit-canned, Norm.

868
01:00:11,224 --> 01:00:14,216
Anyway, don't worry about it.
It'll lead to something good.

869
01:00:14,394 --> 01:00:16,521
- Hey, I'm part of this too.
- No.

870
01:00:16,696 --> 01:00:19,130
- Yeah. I stood by and let it happen.
- Norm.

871
01:00:19,299 --> 01:00:21,927
You were feeling it.
You were in the loan zone, remember?

872
01:00:22,101 --> 01:00:23,363
- I was.
- I was watching you.

873
01:00:23,536 --> 01:00:24,764
Yeah, you were.

874
01:00:24,937 --> 01:00:28,464
But I'm afraid it's caught up with us.
Now you and I have to face the music.

875
01:00:28,641 --> 01:00:31,804
- Come on.
- Hey. Can I have one minute?

876
01:00:31,978 --> 01:00:34,947
- Okay.
- Lee? What do you need?

877
01:00:35,114 --> 01:00:36,945
You may be my last loan.

878
01:00:38,951 --> 01:00:40,680
It's a Ducati.

879
01:00:40,853 --> 01:00:44,345
I'm thinking it'll get people off my back
about the male nurse thing.

880
01:00:45,692 --> 01:00:49,184
- See what I mean?
- Yeah. Nice ride.

881
01:00:51,130 --> 01:00:53,826
See you on the other side, Lee.

882
01:00:56,602 --> 01:00:58,297
Carl.

883
01:01:00,673 --> 01:01:03,870
Wesley T. Parker.
Vice President, Brea Federal Savings.

884
01:01:04,043 --> 01:01:05,943
Pleasure to meet you.

885
01:01:13,119 --> 01:01:17,783
Every two months, the typical loan officer
approves 35 to 40 loans.

886
01:01:17,957 --> 01:01:19,982
You have given out...

887
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:22,728
...561.

888
01:01:23,429 --> 01:01:24,953
A little more than average, then.

889
01:01:25,131 --> 01:01:27,497
What's even more unusual
are the amounts.

890
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:34,906
A $250 loan for a mountain bike,
$600 for windsurfing lessons.

891
01:01:35,074 --> 01:01:37,008
Have you ever tried that? It's fun.

892
01:01:37,176 --> 01:01:40,168
Carl, this bank traditionally has
never given out small loans.

893
01:01:40,346 --> 01:01:42,473
- If I can explain... Yeah, certainly.
- Sit down.

894
01:01:42,648 --> 01:01:45,116
At first I thought you
might be raiding our coffers.

895
01:01:45,318 --> 01:01:48,310
- I would never do that.
- I would if I could, so why wouldn't you?

896
01:01:54,560 --> 01:01:56,118
But...

897
01:01:58,364 --> 01:01:59,695
But then I looked closer.

898
01:02:00,466 --> 01:02:03,162
These people are so grateful
to have their needs met...

899
01:02:03,336 --> 01:02:06,464
...more than 98 percent of them
are following through with payments.

900
01:02:06,639 --> 01:02:08,732
And because you've given out
so many of them...

901
01:02:08,908 --> 01:02:13,174
...we're actually making a lot of money.
Carl, these micro-loans, not bad.

902
01:02:13,546 --> 01:02:15,605
See, Car, you worrywart.

903
01:02:15,782 --> 01:02:19,343
Carl, what would you say if I asked you
to work upstairs with the big boys?

904
01:02:19,552 --> 01:02:21,782
- Corporate?
- Wow.

905
01:02:22,021 --> 01:02:24,114
That's great. I would have to say...

906
01:02:24,290 --> 01:02:27,123
No, wait. Before we give our answer...

907
01:02:27,293 --> 01:02:29,454
...let's talk money.
Dollars and cents, Wes.

908
01:02:29,629 --> 01:02:33,531
I'm afraid I can't discuss that with you,
since we're only taking Carl.

909
01:02:34,033 --> 01:02:35,398
Got it. Yep.

910
01:02:35,568 --> 01:02:38,537
We'll have the employment contract to you
by the end of the day.

911
01:02:38,704 --> 01:02:41,229
Nice work, Carl. Bump my fist.

912
01:02:41,407 --> 01:02:45,901
- Missed it. I was gonna fist you.
- Here's some fist.

913
01:02:52,652 --> 01:02:54,483
This one is nice.

914
01:02:54,654 --> 01:02:57,054
I especially love it in cream.
What do you think?

915
01:02:57,223 --> 01:02:58,247
- I love it.
- Yeah?

916
01:02:58,424 --> 01:02:59,789
Yeah.

917
01:02:59,959 --> 01:03:03,520
Bridal bingo?
How do you play bridal bingo?

918
01:03:03,696 --> 01:03:05,425
It's the same as regular bingo...

919
01:03:05,598 --> 01:03:09,227
...but you just yell embarrassing
facts about the bride, okay?

920
01:03:10,303 --> 01:03:11,327
Yeah.

921
01:03:11,504 --> 01:03:13,404
- No, I'm not doing bridal bingo.
- Come on.

922
01:03:13,573 --> 01:03:15,165
I don't want anything complicated.

923
01:03:15,341 --> 01:03:18,139
You gotta squeeze every drop of juice
out of this experience.

924
01:03:18,311 --> 01:03:20,745
It doesn't sound complicated.
Is it complicated?

925
01:03:20,913 --> 01:03:24,508
Are you going to be asking a lot
more question? I don't got all day.

926
01:03:27,887 --> 01:03:31,880
- Maybe we should just go somewhere else.
- It's okay. I'll talk to her.

927
01:04:20,773 --> 01:04:21,797
Okay.

928
01:04:25,545 --> 01:04:28,013
Okay, bridal bingo very simple, okay?

929
01:04:28,180 --> 01:04:31,616
I can explain to you in more detail
if you want.

930
01:04:38,224 --> 01:04:39,486
What's going on?

931
01:04:41,227 --> 01:04:43,286
I mean, someone's trying to kill himself.

932
01:04:44,564 --> 01:04:46,156
Jump.

933
01:04:46,766 --> 01:04:49,257
What the hell are you looking at?

934
01:04:50,303 --> 01:04:53,830
- Don't do it.
- Don't point at me, buddy.

935
01:04:54,006 --> 01:04:55,906
Hey, lady, move that dog.

936
01:04:56,509 --> 01:04:59,069
Buddy, can you move over
a little bit, like two feet?

937
01:04:59,245 --> 01:05:00,712
Has somebody called the police?

938
01:05:00,880 --> 01:05:04,338
Yeah. He'll be dead before they get here.
Somebody needs to talk him down.

939
01:05:04,517 --> 01:05:07,850
- Move out the way.
- Somebody help him!

940
01:05:26,572 --> 01:05:28,096
Don't do it.

941
01:05:30,209 --> 01:05:32,109
It can't be that bad.

942
01:05:34,513 --> 01:05:35,912
Hey, buddy.

943
01:05:36,549 --> 01:05:38,039
Who are you, man?

944
01:05:38,217 --> 01:05:41,914
Don't try anything. I'm gonna kill
myself, so don't try to stop me.

945
01:05:42,555 --> 01:05:45,023
- Okay.
- What do mean, "Okay"?

946
01:05:45,191 --> 01:05:48,718
No, I don't mean okay.
Just give me a second.

947
01:05:49,295 --> 01:05:51,422
I should say something to you here.

948
01:05:53,099 --> 01:05:54,657
I don't really know what it is.

949
01:05:54,834 --> 01:05:56,927
Man, you terrible at this.
Are you even a cop?

950
01:05:57,103 --> 01:05:59,071
Hold on a second, I'm thinking.

951
01:06:01,974 --> 01:06:04,909
Wait. I've got it.

952
01:06:07,847 --> 01:06:09,474
Where you going, man?

953
01:06:09,649 --> 01:06:12,413
- I know it's not what I think it is.
- Just stop.

954
01:06:12,585 --> 01:06:14,143
Oh, man.

955
01:06:19,592 --> 01:06:23,392
- My man. Hello?
- Don't do it. I'm coming.

956
01:06:23,562 --> 01:06:26,122
Patience is a virtue.

957
01:06:29,068 --> 01:06:32,003
What the hell you doing in there?

958
01:06:34,707 --> 01:06:38,837
I wish you would step back
From that ledge, my friend

959
01:06:39,679 --> 01:06:45,515
You could cut ties with all the lies
That you've been living in

960
01:06:45,685 --> 01:06:49,280
And if you never want to see me again

961
01:06:49,455 --> 01:06:54,620
I would understand

962
01:06:54,794 --> 01:07:01,791
I would understand

963
01:07:02,134 --> 01:07:03,965
Um... Oh...

964
01:07:04,403 --> 01:07:05,529
What is it?

965
01:07:06,405 --> 01:07:09,033
The angry boy a bit too insane

966
01:07:09,241 --> 01:07:12,039
Icing over a secret pain

967
01:07:12,211 --> 01:07:17,444
You know you don't belong

968
01:07:17,616 --> 01:07:21,780
Everyone I know has got a reason

969
01:07:22,221 --> 01:07:23,711
To say

970
01:07:23,889 --> 01:07:25,379
You can put the past away

971
01:07:25,558 --> 01:07:29,585
I wish you would step back
From that ledge, my friend

972
01:07:29,762 --> 01:07:34,495
You could cut ties with all the lies
You've been living in

973
01:07:34,667 --> 01:07:38,364
And if you never want to see me again

974
01:07:38,537 --> 01:07:43,236
I would understand

975
01:07:43,409 --> 01:07:46,242
I would understand

976
01:07:48,180 --> 01:07:52,981
I would understand

977
01:07:53,152 --> 01:07:57,145
I would understand

978
01:07:57,923 --> 01:08:00,323
I would understand

979
01:08:09,034 --> 01:08:11,594
I got blisters on my fingers.

980
01:08:19,912 --> 01:08:21,504
Carl.

981
01:08:21,947 --> 01:08:24,507
Stephanie, Ted, hey.

982
01:08:24,683 --> 01:08:26,776
How's it going?
What are you guys doing here?

983
01:08:26,952 --> 01:08:30,718
We're doing a week in Tahiti. Ted's father
owns a little piece of property there.

984
01:08:30,890 --> 01:08:35,190
A hundred acres isn't so little, hon.
Not in Tahiti, anyway.

985
01:08:36,228 --> 01:08:40,187
Hey, I saw you on TV.
That was amazing, Carl.

986
01:08:40,366 --> 01:08:43,460
It's just a little life that needed saving.
No big deal.

987
01:08:43,636 --> 01:08:46,104
- So where you headed?
- I'm meeting my girlfriend here.

988
01:08:46,272 --> 01:08:48,206
- We don't know where we're going.
- Really?

989
01:08:48,374 --> 01:08:51,935
Yeah, we're just gonna pick a place.
Kind of an eenie, meenie, minie thing.

990
01:08:52,111 --> 01:08:55,410
Keeps it fresh. I'll see you guys.

991
01:08:57,082 --> 01:08:59,676
- That sounds like a lot of fun.
- Can you imagine?

992
01:08:59,852 --> 01:09:01,547
No.

993
01:09:13,165 --> 01:09:14,894
So I have some carry-on here.

994
01:09:15,067 --> 01:09:19,470
I'd like two tickets on the first
plane out of here, please.

995
01:09:19,638 --> 01:09:21,230
We've never done this before.

996
01:09:23,976 --> 01:09:28,436
The next flight available
for boarding...

997
01:09:29,014 --> 01:09:30,447
...is to Lincoln, Nebraska.

998
01:09:32,418 --> 01:09:33,442
Okay.

999
01:09:33,619 --> 01:09:34,643
- Okay.
- Okay.

1000
01:09:34,820 --> 01:09:35,980
- Yeah?
- Lincoln.

1001
01:09:36,155 --> 01:09:37,315
Here we come.

1002
01:09:41,260 --> 01:09:43,455
Where does someone go
in Lincoln, Nebraska?

1003
01:09:43,629 --> 01:09:46,655
Well, clearly we should go there.

1004
01:09:52,471 --> 01:09:54,666
"The earliest switchboard
operators' headsets...

1005
01:09:54,840 --> 01:09:57,104
...weighed over 10 and a half pounds."

1006
01:09:57,276 --> 01:10:00,074
- Interesting.
- Look at this.

1007
01:10:01,580 --> 01:10:04,048
- Very first phone call ever.
- Pretty cool.

1008
01:10:04,216 --> 01:10:05,911
Check out the phone.

1009
01:10:06,085 --> 01:10:09,612
Smaller than I thought they would be.
Hold on, I'm vibrating.

1010
01:10:09,788 --> 01:10:11,688
Hello?

1011
01:10:16,028 --> 01:10:17,495
Nice shot.

1012
01:10:19,598 --> 01:10:23,193
- What do you know about that?
- Pretty sexy.

1013
01:10:24,103 --> 01:10:26,003
So, what do I do? I just...

1014
01:10:27,706 --> 01:10:30,106
- Take it easy.
- Here you go.

1015
01:10:31,944 --> 01:10:33,969
- Okay.
- You got it.

1016
01:10:34,146 --> 01:10:35,170
Pull?

1017
01:10:37,049 --> 01:10:39,108
- Good one.
- I got it. I got it.

1018
01:10:39,285 --> 01:10:42,186
Can I do it again? Can I do it again?
What's wrong?

1019
01:10:48,193 --> 01:10:50,127
Ladies and gentlemen, let's hear it...

1020
01:10:50,296 --> 01:10:54,562
... for your University
of Nebraska Cornhuskers.

1021
01:11:02,608 --> 01:11:04,576
Twenty bucks says Oklahoma kills them.

1022
01:11:04,743 --> 01:11:07,303
Hey, Pete, you mind putting that
on a coaster?

1023
01:11:07,479 --> 01:11:09,071
What, do you live here now?

1024
01:11:09,248 --> 01:11:12,877
Yeah. I asked Carl and he had to say yes.

1025
01:11:13,052 --> 01:11:15,714
Hey. Is that Carl?

1026
01:11:15,888 --> 01:11:18,015
- Wait a second.
- Wait a second, wait a second.

1027
01:11:19,391 --> 01:11:24,658
The energy is palpable here, Chris.
I can't even hear myself think.

1028
01:11:25,631 --> 01:11:28,327
- I guess they're in Nebraska.
- Wow.

1029
01:11:28,968 --> 01:11:33,530
Now, this is the really interesting part.
If you don't take the heads off properly...

1030
01:11:33,706 --> 01:11:36,197
...then everything gets mixed
into the batch.

1031
01:11:36,375 --> 01:11:39,367
Someone gets a beak in their bucket
or a mouthful of tendons...

1032
01:11:39,545 --> 01:11:42,309
...and you got a lawsuit on your hands.

1033
01:11:43,615 --> 01:11:45,810
We got a fainter down in Head Removal.

1034
01:11:50,823 --> 01:11:53,485
I can't believe I tripped like that.

1035
01:11:54,827 --> 01:11:58,388
- It seemed like you fainted.
- No, I told you my foot caught a nail.

1036
01:11:58,564 --> 01:12:02,159
Okay. Because I thought it was
all the chicken beaks in the bucket.

1037
01:12:02,334 --> 01:12:04,199
Don't, please.

1038
01:12:05,971 --> 01:12:08,303
Oh, God. It's starting to rain.

1039
01:12:09,641 --> 01:12:12,007
Here. I have to protect you.

1040
01:12:12,277 --> 01:12:13,767
Come on.

1041
01:12:13,946 --> 01:12:17,814
Hurry, there's no time to lose.
We have to find shelter.

1042
01:12:17,983 --> 01:12:19,678
Come on.

1043
01:12:21,120 --> 01:12:24,715
Get in here. It's okay. I got you.

1044
01:12:24,890 --> 01:12:27,620
Allison, are you okay?

1045
01:12:28,293 --> 01:12:31,592
Are you hurt? Are you hurt? You're okay?

1046
01:12:38,103 --> 01:12:39,434
What?

1047
01:12:40,539 --> 01:12:43,064
I don't know. I think I love you.

1048
01:12:44,476 --> 01:12:45,943
Really?

1049
01:12:46,111 --> 01:12:50,707
I've known that I like you for a while,
but just now I decided that I love you.

1050
01:12:50,883 --> 01:12:54,182
- Do you love me?
- Definitely.

1051
01:12:54,353 --> 01:12:56,082
I love you like...

1052
01:12:56,588 --> 01:12:59,887
...I can't believe it.
It's kind of ridiculous.

1053
01:13:00,692 --> 01:13:02,159
I've been thinking...

1054
01:13:02,327 --> 01:13:04,818
...and I know it's crazy,
especially for me...

1055
01:13:04,997 --> 01:13:09,866
...but maybe when we get back
we should move in together.

1056
01:13:11,203 --> 01:13:14,536
Wow. Really?
You've been thinking that?

1057
01:13:15,040 --> 01:13:16,667
What do you think?

1058
01:13:16,842 --> 01:13:21,279
- What do I think? Uh... Yeah.
- Oh, God. You paused.

1059
01:13:21,447 --> 01:13:22,914
- No, I didn't pause.
- You paused.

1060
01:13:23,082 --> 01:13:25,050
No, I didn't pause.
It was just a big step.

1061
01:13:25,217 --> 01:13:27,845
It was a stupid idea.
I shouldn't have said anything.

1062
01:13:28,020 --> 01:13:31,922
Come on, what are you talking about?
Here, ask me again.

1063
01:13:32,791 --> 01:13:34,122
- Do you wanna move...
- Yes.

1064
01:13:34,293 --> 01:13:38,787
Did I pause there? I could probably knock
a couple milliseconds off that if you...

1065
01:13:53,579 --> 01:13:57,208
- Where are you traveling today?
- Los Angeles.

1066
01:14:00,052 --> 01:14:02,850
I'll just be one minute.

1067
01:14:03,021 --> 01:14:06,513
We should do this every weekend.
We could see the whole world.

1068
01:14:06,692 --> 01:14:08,523
I'm in.

1069
01:14:08,760 --> 01:14:11,524
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm good.

1070
01:14:14,466 --> 01:14:15,865
Sir?

1071
01:14:17,236 --> 01:14:20,205
- You mind coming with us, please?
- I'm sorry?

1072
01:14:20,372 --> 01:14:23,205
We just wanna ask you a few questions.

1073
01:14:25,844 --> 01:14:28,574
You're hilarious. Oh, that's great.

1074
01:14:28,747 --> 01:14:31,545
Oh, beautiful. Are you in on this too?

1075
01:14:31,717 --> 01:14:33,878
Oh, my God, you guys really
had me going there.

1076
01:14:34,052 --> 01:14:36,885
There's a crazy man in the terminal.
Red alert.

1077
01:14:38,323 --> 01:14:40,655
- Oh, good job.
- Let's go, funny guy.

1078
01:14:40,826 --> 01:14:42,418
Come on, lady.

1079
01:14:44,163 --> 01:14:47,428
- Do you hate your country, Mr. Allen?
- What?

1080
01:14:47,599 --> 01:14:51,763
- Do you hate America?
- No. Of course not.

1081
01:14:51,937 --> 01:14:53,905
Then why are you plotting to attack it?

1082
01:14:54,072 --> 01:14:56,063
- What?
- I think you have the wrong guy.

1083
01:14:56,241 --> 01:14:58,072
I'm sorry. Was I speaking to you?

1084
01:14:58,243 --> 01:15:00,404
We've been tracking you.
We know who you are.

1085
01:15:00,579 --> 01:15:04,140
- We know what you're planning.
- This is insane. Do you think I'm a terrorist?

1086
01:15:04,316 --> 01:15:07,149
Why did you purchase these
plane tickets at the last minute?

1087
01:15:07,319 --> 01:15:09,412
It was a spontaneous vacation.

1088
01:15:09,588 --> 01:15:11,522
Right. I was just saying
to Agent Tweed...

1089
01:15:11,690 --> 01:15:14,955
...how I wanted to take a fun-filled
vacation to Lincoln, Nebraska.

1090
01:15:15,127 --> 01:15:19,257
Are you currently a member
of Persianwifefinder.com?

1091
01:15:19,464 --> 01:15:22,490
- Yes, but you don't understand.
- Yes? Who is that?

1092
01:15:22,668 --> 01:15:25,796
Faranoush. It was nothing. I can explain.
I can explain.

1093
01:15:25,971 --> 01:15:29,737
Explain this, jackhole. As Chief Loan
Officer at Brea Federal Savings and Loan,

1094
01:15:29,908 --> 01:15:32,433
...you gave a man money to
start a fertilizer business.

1095
01:15:32,611 --> 01:15:34,101
- For what, bombs?
- No.

1096
01:15:34,279 --> 01:15:36,474
Have you recently
started taking flying lessons?

1097
01:15:36,648 --> 01:15:39,173
- Yes. Oh, come on.
- Why did you learn Korean?

1098
01:15:39,351 --> 01:15:41,751
- Are you aligned with the North Koreans?
- No. What?

1099
01:15:41,920 --> 01:15:44,480
You were married for six months.
Some immigration thing?

1100
01:15:44,656 --> 01:15:46,783
- You were married?
- Yes.

1101
01:15:47,793 --> 01:15:49,954
That was a long time ago.
I was gonna tell you.

1102
01:15:50,128 --> 01:15:52,756
I was gonna tell her. I just never...

1103
01:15:52,931 --> 01:15:55,866
Start talking, Carl,
if that is your real name.

1104
01:15:57,002 --> 01:16:01,029
We knew another Karl we weren't
too crazy about, didn't we, Tweed?

1105
01:16:02,341 --> 01:16:04,206
His name was Marx.

1106
01:16:07,913 --> 01:16:10,143
I need to speak to my attorney.

1107
01:16:14,853 --> 01:16:17,981
Several months ago, my client
attended a self-empowerment seminar...

1108
01:16:18,156 --> 01:16:22,991
...that requires him to say yes
to any request that's presented.

1109
01:16:23,161 --> 01:16:25,254
All of the activity
that appears suspicious...

1110
01:16:25,430 --> 01:16:28,524
...the flying lessons,
the spontaneous trip-taking...

1111
01:16:28,700 --> 01:16:31,430
...it's all because he must
say yes to any opportunity.

1112
01:16:32,671 --> 01:16:34,935
- He's really into it.
- You say yes to everything?

1113
01:16:35,107 --> 01:16:37,007
- Are you kidding?
- It's not how it sounds.

1114
01:16:37,175 --> 01:16:38,767
How does it?
I'd love to hear this.

1115
01:16:38,944 --> 01:16:42,004
I'm wondering if there's a better
setting for this back and forth.

1116
01:16:42,180 --> 01:16:45,149
Maybe we should speak privately.
Come on outside.

1117
01:16:47,953 --> 01:16:51,116
- Whew. That was close.
- What the hell, Carl?

1118
01:16:51,290 --> 01:16:53,258
Are you serious?
You say yes to everything?

1119
01:16:53,425 --> 01:16:56,292
- Even if you don't like it?
- No, of course not.

1120
01:16:56,828 --> 01:16:58,853
- Sometimes.
- Oh, good. What a relief.

1121
01:16:59,031 --> 01:17:02,762
I thought you lied all the time, but
it's just sometimes. That's excellent.

1122
01:17:02,934 --> 01:17:04,663
So you didn't wanna
come to my show...

1123
01:17:04,836 --> 01:17:08,203
...you didn't wanna go jogging with me,
you didn't wanna travel with me?

1124
01:17:08,373 --> 01:17:10,204
Yes, I did. That was my idea.

1125
01:17:10,375 --> 01:17:12,366
When I asked you
if you wanted to move in...

1126
01:17:12,544 --> 01:17:14,978
...that took a lot for me to do that,
and I meant it.

1127
01:17:15,147 --> 01:17:17,775
I didn't know what to expect,
but I guess I figured...

1128
01:17:17,949 --> 01:17:20,281
...like an adult, you were gonna
weigh the options.

1129
01:17:20,452 --> 01:17:21,646
You paused.

1130
01:17:21,820 --> 01:17:24,482
You wanted to say no but you couldn't.
You had to say yes.

1131
01:17:24,656 --> 01:17:28,786
- That's not entirely true.
- How do I know if anything you did...

1132
01:17:28,960 --> 01:17:33,124
was because you wanted to or because
you were following some damn program?

1133
01:17:40,772 --> 01:17:42,034
Allison.

1134
01:17:43,742 --> 01:17:45,209
Bye, Carl.

1135
01:17:59,458 --> 01:18:03,019
I can't believe I didn't tell her
I was married. I'm such an idiot.

1136
01:18:03,795 --> 01:18:05,387
- You know what I did?
- What's that?

1137
01:18:05,564 --> 01:18:08,761
She asked me to move in with her
and I hesitated. That was like a no.

1138
01:18:08,934 --> 01:18:10,925
I should have said yes right away,
you know?

1139
01:18:11,103 --> 01:18:14,072
That's how the whole thing got
screwed up. I broke the covenant.

1140
01:18:14,239 --> 01:18:15,866
Ever think things got screwed up...

1141
01:18:16,041 --> 01:18:19,909
because you said yes without thinking,
not because of a covenant you made?

1142
01:18:20,078 --> 01:18:22,046
It's with the universe.
It's a big deal.

1143
01:18:22,214 --> 01:18:24,682
There is a middle ground here.
You can process things.

1144
01:18:24,850 --> 01:18:28,411
You can weigh them individually and
make decisions on a case-by-case basis...

1145
01:18:28,587 --> 01:18:30,054
...a.k.a. what normal people do.

1146
01:18:30,222 --> 01:18:32,986
Yeah, that's a good point.
Hold that thought. Allison!

1147
01:18:33,158 --> 01:18:34,284
Or not.

1148
01:18:34,459 --> 01:18:36,359
Allison, please,
can't we talk for a sec?

1149
01:18:36,528 --> 01:18:38,018
- Get away from me.
- Okay.

1150
01:18:38,830 --> 01:18:40,161
- Farther.
- Yeah.

1151
01:18:42,134 --> 01:18:43,533
Carl.

1152
01:18:47,406 --> 01:18:48,873
Bye, Carl.

1153
01:18:49,674 --> 01:18:52,575
- Oh, I just love good food.
- So do I.

1154
01:18:52,744 --> 01:18:54,575
- Do you?
- Uh-huh.

1155
01:18:54,746 --> 01:18:56,680
You know you and I are a lot alike?

1156
01:18:57,916 --> 01:19:00,248
My mother likes good food.

1157
01:19:01,119 --> 01:19:03,747
She always used to say,
"I'd rather eat good food...

1158
01:19:03,922 --> 01:19:05,856
... than bad food any old day
of the week. "

1159
01:19:06,024 --> 01:19:07,582
Hey.

1160
01:19:07,893 --> 01:19:09,758
It's me again.

1161
01:19:09,928 --> 01:19:12,396
Specifically I'm talking
about 15 to 20 percent.

1162
01:19:12,564 --> 01:19:15,533
The way we're gonna do this
is we're gonna go after the...

1163
01:19:31,450 --> 01:19:34,248
Okay, I'm totally off the controls.

1164
01:19:35,120 --> 01:19:37,782
You're officially flying by yourself.

1165
01:19:39,357 --> 01:19:40,847
Cool.

1166
01:19:41,293 --> 01:19:44,319
There's no greater feeling
in the world, is there?

1167
01:19:47,566 --> 01:19:53,027
Hello, Jake, Rodrigo,
Penelope, Phillip, Zachary.

1168
01:19:53,205 --> 01:19:55,036
I'd like to thank you all for coming...

1169
01:19:55,207 --> 01:19:58,335
...for no other reason
than you genuinely wanted to.

1170
01:19:58,510 --> 01:20:02,173
In an unrelated note, everyone
else can go jump off a bridge.

1171
01:20:14,226 --> 01:20:15,921
Ah!

1172
01:20:33,612 --> 01:20:34,772
Allison?

1173
01:20:34,946 --> 01:20:39,076
No, it's Wes P., Big C.
Did I catch you at a bad time?

1174
01:20:39,251 --> 01:20:44,314
- No, no, I'm just hanging here.
- Okay, okay. Just checking in.

1175
01:20:44,489 --> 01:20:46,320
Seeing how Corporate's treating you.

1176
01:20:46,491 --> 01:20:48,891
Kicks the crap out of dealing
with those peons, huh?

1177
01:20:49,060 --> 01:20:52,791
- I never really thought of them as...
- Hang on, hang on, just a second.

1178
01:20:55,200 --> 01:20:58,294
Wes? Can you hear me?

1179
01:20:58,470 --> 01:20:59,732
Go get the ball!

1180
01:20:59,905 --> 01:21:03,341
So listen, I got a job for you.
We're shutting down a bunch of branches

1181
01:21:03,508 --> 01:21:07,410
- and I need you to tell the managers.
- Shutting down branches?

1182
01:21:07,846 --> 01:21:09,313
Which ones?

1183
01:21:10,982 --> 01:21:13,610
We are Sparta!

1184
01:21:17,355 --> 01:21:18,788
Hi, Norm.

1185
01:21:42,013 --> 01:21:44,311
You have three messages.

1186
01:21:44,482 --> 01:21:47,212
Hi, Car, this is your
answer phone speaking.

1187
01:21:47,385 --> 01:21:50,252
No, it's me, Norm, just a reminder
about the party tonight.

1188
01:21:50,422 --> 01:21:53,482
I'll see you there, buddy. Roger, out.

1189
01:21:53,892 --> 01:21:56,690
Carl, it's Roons.
Thanks for letting me use your car.

1190
01:21:56,861 --> 01:21:59,421
You might notice the front
bumper missing. Not to worry.

1191
01:21:59,598 --> 01:22:02,362
I gave them your insurance.
The whole thing's being handled.

1192
01:22:02,534 --> 01:22:06,903
And I left a pile of laundry in my room.
Don't forget, no starch. Love you.

1193
01:22:07,505 --> 01:22:10,531
It's Peter. I'm sure you're aware
and completely on top of it...

1194
01:22:10,709 --> 01:22:14,475
... but just wanted to make sure Lucy's
shower is still on for tomorrow night.

1195
01:22:14,646 --> 01:22:17,774
Haven't received confirmation
of any sort from you. At all.

1196
01:22:17,949 --> 01:22:20,611
- Shower. Shit.
- It's on.

1197
01:22:20,785 --> 01:22:22,753
Right? Call me.

1198
01:22:35,266 --> 01:22:36,290
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

1199
01:22:36,468 --> 01:22:39,028
- What's wrong?
- I just really need to talk to you.

1200
01:22:39,204 --> 01:22:40,466
What?

1201
01:22:40,639 --> 01:22:43,301
Come on inside. I'll explain everything.

1202
01:22:48,546 --> 01:22:50,810
Surprise!

1203
01:22:50,982 --> 01:22:53,576
- Oh, my God.
- Happy shower.

1204
01:22:53,752 --> 01:22:55,219
How did you pull this off?

1205
01:22:55,387 --> 01:22:58,049
I just called in a few favors,
kept throwing money at it.

1206
01:22:58,790 --> 01:23:01,088
I like it, I like it.

1207
01:23:01,259 --> 01:23:02,692
- Rooney.
- Congrats.

1208
01:23:02,861 --> 01:23:04,954
- That's Bert. He's in fertilizer.
- Hey, B.

1209
01:23:05,130 --> 01:23:07,291
- And Lee, he's a male nurse.
- I know Lee.

1210
01:23:07,766 --> 01:23:10,599
Let's get this guy a drink.
He doesn't have long to live.

1211
01:23:10,769 --> 01:23:13,260
On him, on him.

1212
01:23:16,274 --> 01:23:17,298
Cake?

1213
01:23:17,475 --> 01:23:18,499
- Thanks.
- Sure.

1214
01:23:18,677 --> 01:23:23,080
- Oh, John Goodman.
- No, it's Alec Baldwin.

1215
01:23:24,649 --> 01:23:27,641
Oh, right. Nailed it.

1216
01:23:34,092 --> 01:23:38,085
Norm. Hey, thanks for coming, man.

1217
01:23:38,263 --> 01:23:41,096
- How you holding up?
- I'm okay, Car.

1218
01:23:41,266 --> 01:23:44,133
You know, taking her day by day.

1219
01:23:44,302 --> 01:23:47,135
Yeah. Well, I got a friend
I want you to meet.

1220
01:23:47,539 --> 01:23:48,665
Oh.

1221
01:23:53,078 --> 01:23:57,515
- Norman, this is Soo-Mi.
- Hi there.

1222
01:23:59,384 --> 01:24:03,753
- Can I call you Soo?
- Yes.

1223
01:24:03,922 --> 01:24:04,946
Do you dance?

1224
01:24:05,523 --> 01:24:08,014
Well, I've won some competitions.
Watch this.

1225
01:24:08,193 --> 01:24:11,754
- Come on.
- Look out. Oh, hey.

1226
01:24:38,022 --> 01:24:43,654
- Oh, that's an interesting one.
- Yep. And it's half-price, so...

1227
01:24:47,966 --> 01:24:49,831
Oh, jeez.

1228
01:24:50,435 --> 01:24:53,734
- That's the best wedding shower ever, man.
- Man, you deserve it.

1229
01:24:53,905 --> 01:24:55,873
- You all right?
- Yeah. Yeah.

1230
01:24:56,040 --> 01:24:59,134
- Yeah? She's still not calling you back?
- No.

1231
01:24:59,310 --> 01:25:01,835
- What are you gonna do?
- I don't know.

1232
01:25:02,013 --> 01:25:06,074
I guess I'll just stick with the program.
Keep saying yes to everything.

1233
01:25:06,251 --> 01:25:07,843
I know it sounds silly...

1234
01:25:08,019 --> 01:25:10,579
...but maybe that bad stuff
will lead to something good.

1235
01:25:10,755 --> 01:25:15,055
Doesn't sound silly.
Well, maybe a little silly.

1236
01:25:15,660 --> 01:25:17,355
You wanna get dinner tomorrow night?

1237
01:25:17,529 --> 01:25:20,521
- Yes. And not because I have to.
- Great.

1238
01:25:20,698 --> 01:25:23,326
- Well, you do have to.
- Yeah.

1239
01:25:24,269 --> 01:25:26,999
- But you want to.
- Oh, yeah.

1240
01:25:27,172 --> 01:25:29,640
- So bad.
- Oh, God, me too.

1241
01:25:29,808 --> 01:25:31,776
- It's all I can think about.
- Really?

1242
01:25:37,248 --> 01:25:39,148
Hi there.

1243
01:25:40,084 --> 01:25:41,711
Hello there.

1244
01:25:42,487 --> 01:25:45,456
You must be Tillie.

1245
01:25:46,491 --> 01:25:51,485
- I've certainly heard a lot about you.
- Isn't that nice?

1246
01:25:54,999 --> 01:26:01,097
- Would you mind helping me?
- Absolutely, yeah. No problem.

1247
01:26:02,507 --> 01:26:04,236
Come on, let's go.

1248
01:26:14,085 --> 01:26:16,645
- Hello?
- Hi, Carl.

1249
01:26:17,288 --> 01:26:23,158
- Oh, Stephanie. What's wrong?
- Can you come over?

1250
01:26:23,328 --> 01:26:26,195
We had this big fight and he stormed off.

1251
01:26:26,364 --> 01:26:30,232
Well, these things have a way
of working themselves out.

1252
01:26:30,401 --> 01:26:32,130
I don't know.

1253
01:26:33,037 --> 01:26:37,030
- Not this time. I think it's over.
- Yeah?

1254
01:26:38,376 --> 01:26:40,844
You know,
but maybe it's supposed to be.

1255
01:26:41,012 --> 01:26:45,278
I mean, a part of me felt like something
wasn't right from the beginning.

1256
01:26:45,450 --> 01:26:49,784
- Yeah?
- I don't know, Carl. I'm so confused.

1257
01:26:49,954 --> 01:26:56,223
Yeah. I'm gonna assume at
this point, it's, well...

1258
01:26:56,394 --> 01:26:59,363
- Stay with me tonight.
- Oh, Steph...

1259
01:27:04,202 --> 01:27:05,931
Steph...

1260
01:27:06,604 --> 01:27:08,435
...I can't.

1261
01:27:09,073 --> 01:27:10,768
I'm sorry.

1262
01:27:13,278 --> 01:27:15,212
What are you saying?

1263
01:27:16,848 --> 01:27:19,043
I'm saying no.

1264
01:27:35,533 --> 01:27:37,000
Are you serious?

1265
01:27:51,382 --> 01:27:52,542
Oh, Jesus.

1266
01:28:00,024 --> 01:28:02,549
Oh, please.

1267
01:28:03,061 --> 01:28:06,690
I didn't even see the red zone.
I've only been here for 20 minutes.

1268
01:28:06,864 --> 01:28:10,925
- Sorry, pal. Can't help you.
- Oh, come on. Can't you give me a break?

1269
01:28:11,102 --> 01:28:14,936
No, man, no, man, no, man.

1270
01:28:15,106 --> 01:28:19,304
- No man, no man, no man...
- Not possible!

1271
01:28:21,546 --> 01:28:23,673
Jackoff.

1272
01:28:24,749 --> 01:28:30,278
Chapter 26,
"Words That Rhyme With Yes."

1273
01:28:30,455 --> 01:28:33,083
Guess, mess.

1274
01:28:33,257 --> 01:28:39,287
Tess, that's a name.
Less, a word and a name.

1275
01:28:39,464 --> 01:28:41,432
- Terrence, don't freak out.
- What the fuck?

1276
01:29:06,090 --> 01:29:08,854
Jesus, that nurse couldn't be
any more obvious.

1277
01:29:10,261 --> 01:29:13,958
She was coming in the room. It's like,
"Give me some space, woman."

1278
01:29:14,132 --> 01:29:17,693
Again, I'm pretty sure
she was just here checking on Carl.

1279
01:29:17,969 --> 01:29:19,903
Peter.

1280
01:29:20,638 --> 01:29:22,299
A covenant.

1281
01:29:22,473 --> 01:29:24,771
Hey, buddy, you all right?

1282
01:29:25,376 --> 01:29:28,345
The covenant, it's coming down
hard on me, man.

1283
01:29:29,213 --> 01:29:32,046
- He keeps talking this covenant nonsense.
- It's not nonsense.

1284
01:29:32,216 --> 01:29:33,683
It is nonsense.

1285
01:29:35,420 --> 01:29:37,012
It's him.

1286
01:29:38,556 --> 01:29:42,822
Oh, thank God. Terrence. You have to
remove the covenant. It's killing me.

1287
01:29:42,994 --> 01:29:45,792
First of all, what were
you doing in my car?

1288
01:29:45,963 --> 01:29:48,397
I told you,
I need you to remove the covenant.

1289
01:29:48,566 --> 01:29:52,400
There is no covenant. There never was.
I was just riffing.

1290
01:29:53,438 --> 01:29:55,668
- Riffing?
- Well, I had to say something.

1291
01:29:55,840 --> 01:29:59,503
You were being difficult,
embarrassing me in front of my crowd.

1292
01:29:59,677 --> 01:30:02,646
- So the whole yes thing is all bullshit?
- No.

1293
01:30:02,814 --> 01:30:04,907
You just don't know how
to use it, that's all.

1294
01:30:05,083 --> 01:30:07,984
Yeah, I do. Say yes to everything.
Real tough to grasp.

1295
01:30:08,152 --> 01:30:10,120
No, that's not the point.

1296
01:30:10,288 --> 01:30:14,088
Well, maybe at first it is, but
that's just to open you up to it...

1297
01:30:14,258 --> 01:30:15,885
...to get you started.

1298
01:30:16,060 --> 01:30:18,688
Then you're saying yes,
not because you have to...

1299
01:30:18,863 --> 01:30:21,297
...not because a covenant
tells you to...

1300
01:30:21,466 --> 01:30:24,401
...but because you know in
your heart that you want to.

1301
01:30:25,670 --> 01:30:27,331
Yeah.

1302
01:30:27,905 --> 01:30:29,634
You're right.

1303
01:30:30,374 --> 01:30:33,275
- That makes perfect sense.
- I told you. I said that.

1304
01:30:33,444 --> 01:30:34,843
- You didn't say that.
- I did.

1305
01:30:35,012 --> 01:30:37,572
- You didn't say it like that.
- Not with an accent.

1306
01:30:38,182 --> 01:30:42,243
Thanks, Terrence. Sorry about
the car, and your head there.

1307
01:30:43,054 --> 01:30:46,922
- What time is it?
- It's 5:40 in the morning.

1308
01:30:47,091 --> 01:30:48,353
Perfect.

1309
01:30:51,162 --> 01:30:52,925
I said that.

1310
01:30:53,131 --> 01:30:54,758
Whatever.

1311
01:30:56,601 --> 01:31:00,162
I'm gonna hop in the bed
just in case the nurse comes back.

1312
01:31:04,442 --> 01:31:06,910
- Sir, you need to get back to your room.
- No, I don't.

1313
01:31:07,078 --> 01:31:09,410
- Sir, stop right there.
- Eat me.

1314
01:31:11,983 --> 01:31:15,942
- Lee. What are you doing here?
- I'm a nurse, remember?

1315
01:31:16,120 --> 01:31:20,489
Oh, yeah, right. Sorry.
Can I borrow your car?

1316
01:31:20,658 --> 01:31:25,095
No, I don't have my car anymore.
I've got my Ducati, thanks to you.

1317
01:31:25,730 --> 01:31:27,857
Ducati.

1318
01:31:32,803 --> 01:31:36,239
Have you ever driven one of these
before? They're quite powerful.

1319
01:31:36,407 --> 01:31:39,604
Yeah, I ride double all the time
on the scooter with Allison.

1320
01:31:39,777 --> 01:31:42,109
No, Carl, this is not the same.

1321
01:31:42,280 --> 01:31:45,272
You really have to be careful. Okay?
These things have a lot of...

1322
01:31:46,284 --> 01:31:48,252
Holy Jesus.

1323
01:31:48,419 --> 01:31:49,681
... torque.

1324
01:32:02,099 --> 01:32:04,158
- How you doing?
- Can't complain.

1325
01:32:06,037 --> 01:32:07,265
Ah!

1326
01:32:07,772 --> 01:32:09,603
You might wanna get out of the way.

1327
01:32:20,885 --> 01:32:23,285
- Come on. Jerk.
- I'm sorry.

1328
01:32:26,357 --> 01:32:27,415
Ah!

1329
01:32:31,295 --> 01:32:32,694
Whoa!

1330
01:33:17,141 --> 01:33:18,904
What an asshole.

1331
01:33:35,126 --> 01:33:36,684
Carl, what are you doing here?

1332
01:33:36,861 --> 01:33:40,763
I just wanted to tell you
that I don't wanna live with you.

1333
01:33:40,931 --> 01:33:44,025
Oh, wow. Thanks.
My knight in shining armor.

1334
01:33:44,201 --> 01:33:46,692
Okay, people, let's go.

1335
01:33:50,241 --> 01:33:51,333
But I wanna be with you.

1336
01:33:51,509 --> 01:33:53,704
But I don't wanna be with you.
I don't know you.

1337
01:33:53,878 --> 01:33:56,438
Everything I said I meant,
except about living together.

1338
01:33:56,614 --> 01:33:58,946
That makes me nervous,
but that's normal. It's big.

1339
01:33:59,116 --> 01:34:01,710
We shouldn't just jump
into that without thinking.

1340
01:34:01,886 --> 01:34:05,845
Why not? You do it with everything.
You say yes to whatever comes your way.

1341
01:34:06,023 --> 01:34:08,992
That's not true. You can say no
if you don't want something.

1342
01:34:09,160 --> 01:34:11,685
Brilliant, Carl. Where'd you get that?
Your literature?

1343
01:34:11,862 --> 01:34:13,853
Look, I know the philosophy
has some holes.

1344
01:34:14,031 --> 01:34:17,797
You think?
Seems pretty airtight to me.

1345
01:34:17,968 --> 01:34:20,937
But if I hadn't done that,
I never would've met you.

1346
01:34:21,105 --> 01:34:24,199
Because the old Carl didn't
think he was enough for anybody.

1347
01:34:24,375 --> 01:34:27,401
I thought if I said yes to things
and got involved with people...

1348
01:34:27,578 --> 01:34:29,910
...sooner or later,
they'd find out I'm not enough.

1349
01:34:30,448 --> 01:34:32,916
I didn't think I had anything to share.

1350
01:34:33,084 --> 01:34:36,349
But now I know that what I have to share
is pretty huge, and I wanna share it with you.

1351
01:34:37,688 --> 01:34:39,815
- Do you mind, Reggie?
- Seriously, dude.

1352
01:34:39,990 --> 01:34:42,015
Sorry, this seemed interesting.

1353
01:34:42,626 --> 01:34:45,094
Even if I had met you,
I never would've asked you out.

1354
01:34:45,262 --> 01:34:48,595
You were the complete opposite of me.
You did things and had friends...

1355
01:34:48,766 --> 01:34:51,826
...and sang in rock bands
and made life happen.

1356
01:34:52,002 --> 01:34:53,936
You weren't scared of anything.

1357
01:34:54,105 --> 01:34:56,767
You don't think I'm scared of anything?

1358
01:34:56,941 --> 01:35:00,104
Who do you think I am?
I'm scared of a lot of things.

1359
01:35:00,711 --> 01:35:02,702
And I'm scared too.

1360
01:35:02,880 --> 01:35:04,939
So let's be scared together.

1361
01:35:06,884 --> 01:35:08,875
I don't know what you want me to say.

1362
01:35:09,520 --> 01:35:10,987
So just say yes...

1363
01:35:11,522 --> 01:35:13,956
...but only if you really want to.

1364
01:35:14,191 --> 01:35:17,319
And can you do it kind of soon?
I think I'm starting to get a chill.

1365
01:35:18,629 --> 01:35:20,460
Yeah, I noticed that.

1366
01:35:20,998 --> 01:35:22,363
Well?

1367
01:35:29,173 --> 01:35:31,403
- Maybe.
- Come on.

1368
01:35:32,276 --> 01:35:35,871
- I'm not gonna say that word.
- Okay, maybe's fine. Maybe's good.

1369
01:35:42,853 --> 01:35:44,514
I like maybe.

1370
01:35:44,688 --> 01:35:45,882
- Reggie, come on.
- Dude.

1371
01:36:12,817 --> 01:36:16,275
Excuse me,
but pleats are kind of out of style.

1372
01:36:16,454 --> 01:36:18,615
You got anything with a flat front?

1373
01:36:18,789 --> 01:36:20,723
Oh, Soo-Mi, pleats are out?

1374
01:36:23,360 --> 01:36:24,793
Thanks, guys.

1375
01:36:24,962 --> 01:36:27,556
This is the single biggest
donation that we've ever had.

1376
01:36:27,731 --> 01:36:30,291
You're welcome, but it was Carl
that made it all happen.

1377
01:36:30,468 --> 01:36:31,833
You're a good man, Carl.

1378
01:36:32,002 --> 01:36:36,530
No big deal. I know a lot of people
who are willing to give.

1379
01:36:38,008 --> 01:36:43,344
Say it a million times.
Say it a million more times.

1380
01:36:43,514 --> 01:36:47,951
And the word you will have
said two million times is:

1381
01:36:48,118 --> 01:36:50,450
Yes!

1382
01:36:55,926 --> 01:36:58,087
Good God.

1383
01:38:32,189 --> 01:38:34,316
So anything else we need to know?

1384
01:38:34,491 --> 01:38:38,757
Your instinct is gonna be to brake
with your chin or your forehead.

1385
01:38:38,929 --> 01:38:40,487
- Try to resist that.
- Right.

1386
01:38:40,664 --> 01:38:42,029
Right.

1387
01:38:43,300 --> 01:38:44,631
Oh, and thanks for the loan.

1388
01:38:44,802 --> 01:38:47,498
I never could have finished
the suits without it.

1389
01:38:49,206 --> 01:38:52,733
Listen, I'm not gonna think anything
less of you if you don't wanna do this.

1390
01:38:52,910 --> 01:38:53,934
What?

1391
01:38:54,111 --> 01:38:57,046
I mean, I'm still gonna be attracted
to you if you're a chicken.

1392
01:38:57,214 --> 01:38:58,875
What if I'm one of those chickens...

1393
01:38:59,049 --> 01:39:02,348
...whose head doesn't get severed
and my beak ends up in the bucket?

1394
01:39:02,519 --> 01:39:05,454
I'll see you at the bottom.
Unless you pass out.

1395
01:39:06,190 --> 01:39:09,182
I told you, my foot caught a nail.

1396
01:39:09,360 --> 01:39:10,588
Hiyah!

1397
01:39:57,441 --> 01:39:58,965
I love this.

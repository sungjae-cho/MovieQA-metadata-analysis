1
00:01:32,133 --> 00:01:34,301
Richard. Richard.

2
00:01:34,302 --> 00:01:35,427
Yeah?

3
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:37,554
I think I heard something.

4
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:15,467
Stay here.

5
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:39,676
- Richard?
- God...

6
00:03:39,677 --> 00:03:40,802
Ah!

7
00:03:40,803 --> 00:03:43,055
Damn it.

8
00:04:25,223 --> 00:04:26,682
How you feeling, son?

9
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:31,353
Peachy, aside from almost
shitting myself.

10
00:04:31,354 --> 00:04:33,188
Yeah, must have been
a scary thing

11
00:04:33,189 --> 00:04:34,856
for a man like you.

12
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:38,777
A civilian, I mean.

13
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:42,489
His name was, uh, Freddy Russel.

14
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:45,325
You know him?

15
00:04:45,326 --> 00:04:47,494
I know shit when I step in it.

16
00:04:47,495 --> 00:04:49,615
I'm gonna have to ask you
to come down to the station,

17
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:51,807
make out a formal statement,
okay?

18
00:05:37,086 --> 00:05:39,296
Okay.

19
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:42,591
Now what?

20
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:44,760
It'll go to the grand jury.

21
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:46,178
They'll look over
your statement,

22
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:50,015
your wife's, mine,
and they'll nobill you.

23
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:51,391
What about the courts?

24
00:05:51,392 --> 00:05:53,310
It'll never get that far.

25
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:55,062
It was self-defense.

26
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:56,396
He was unarmed.

27
00:05:56,397 --> 00:05:58,607
Well, you didn't know that.

28
00:05:58,608 --> 00:06:00,233
It's called "fear of life."

29
00:06:00,234 --> 00:06:02,277
Uh, legally,

30
00:06:02,278 --> 00:06:05,530
he might as well have been
pointing a gun at you.

31
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:07,366
Look...

32
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:09,117
He's a wanted felon.

33
00:06:09,118 --> 00:06:13,121
You're an upstanding citizen
without a record.

34
00:06:13,122 --> 00:06:14,623
Sometimes the good guy wins.

35
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:16,208
Hmm.

36
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:18,877
We're gonna have to keep that
awhile, okay?

37
00:06:19,962 --> 00:06:22,631
Belonged to my dad.

38
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:23,840
He was a good man.

39
00:06:23,841 --> 00:06:26,134
He'd have been proud.

40
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:31,640
Of what?
My finger slipped.

41
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:56,540
You okay?

42
00:06:59,293 --> 00:07:00,961
Uh-uh.

43
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:19,206
Come on, bud.
Let's go back to bed.

44
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:36,181
Jordan, son, stop jiggling.

45
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:40,769
Now, you can't take that
to school with you.

46
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:42,812
- Why?
- Just because.

47
00:08:42,813 --> 00:08:43,813
Because why?

48
00:08:43,814 --> 00:08:46,316
Because I'm your father
and I said so.

49
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:51,696
- Bang!
- Hey.

50
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:53,365
You dead!

51
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:56,368
Don't you say that to me.

52
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,204
I don't want to snap at you,
son,

53
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:00,539
but I don't like that game.

54
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:04,960
Come on.
Let's go.

55
00:09:29,443 --> 00:09:31,903
Dane's Frames.

56
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:34,030
For you, Mr. Dane.

57
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:37,742
Morning.

58
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:39,077
Morning.

59
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:40,161
Hello?

60
00:09:40,162 --> 00:09:41,830
It's me.

61
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:44,291
Just a minute.

62
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:45,292
Richard...

63
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:47,252
it's all over the school.

64
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:50,213
The students keep asking me
about it.

65
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:52,674
Shit.

66
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:54,009
Maybe you should go home.

67
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:55,051
I can't.

68
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:58,096
I have to talk
with the police later.

69
00:09:59,515 --> 00:10:00,724
What the hell for?

70
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:02,892
Uh...
I don't know.

71
00:10:02,893 --> 00:10:04,769
They... they want a statement
from me.

72
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:09,774
How are you feeling?

73
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,447
Fine.

74
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:19,618
I'll see you later tonight,
okay?

75
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:25,582
Oh, man.

76
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:27,000
That air conditioner feels good.

77
00:10:28,252 --> 00:10:29,294
Whew.

78
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:31,212
I hear you got you one
last night.

79
00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:33,715
Back at the paper, they told me.

80
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:37,135
I couldn't believe it was you
at first.

81
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:38,678
I didn't think
you had it in you.

82
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:39,804
Hey, take it easy, Jack.

83
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:41,139
It's not something I'm proud of.

84
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:43,141
Well, it's nothing
to be ashamed of.

85
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:45,143
Some son of a bitch
breaks into my house,

86
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:47,771
he better be ready to pick
his teeth out of his ass.

87
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:49,481
Shoot, man, if it was me...

88
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:50,523
It wasn't you.

89
00:10:50,524 --> 00:10:52,233
It was me.

90
00:10:52,234 --> 00:10:53,902
Now, Jack, if you got mail,
leave it.

91
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:55,570
Otherwise, I'm busy.

92
00:10:58,616 --> 00:10:59,699
Here you go, y'all.

93
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,409
Y'all need anything else
right now?

94
00:11:13,255 --> 00:11:14,798
Uh, beer.

95
00:11:16,133 --> 00:11:17,884
Little early, isn't it?

96
00:11:17,885 --> 00:11:18,968
Not today.

97
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:29,813
Right this way.

98
00:11:40,574 --> 00:11:41,741
Howdy, Rich.

99
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:44,703
How you feeling?

100
00:11:47,498 --> 00:11:48,832
Like a bucket of shit.

101
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:50,208
Shake it off.

102
00:11:54,255 --> 00:11:55,505
So what happens now?

103
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:58,383
We bury the son of a bitch.

104
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:01,094
When?

105
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:02,137
Tomorrow,

106
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:04,013
noon, Greenley's Cemetery,

107
00:12:04,014 --> 00:12:06,182
courtesy of the county.

108
00:12:07,476 --> 00:12:08,977
He got any family?

109
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:10,437
He got a daddy

110
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:11,855
in Huntsville Prison.

111
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:14,065
He just got paroled.

112
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:15,859
Shit don't fall
far from the tree.

113
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:33,418
And I can get these
installed today?

114
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:35,670
Mm.

115
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:18,588
Ted.

116
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:20,924
Hey, Rich.

117
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:22,967
We'll be out of your hair
in a little while.

118
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:34,646
That couch looks hideous.

119
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:36,105
We can take it back.

120
00:13:36,106 --> 00:13:38,191
I thought we agreed
on the floral theme.

121
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:39,526
I made a decision.
I'm sorry.

122
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:40,819
I didn't think
it was a big deal.

123
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,695
I thought we made
these decisions together.

124
00:13:42,696 --> 00:13:44,656
Can we talk about something
besides the couch?

125
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:45,824
Okay.

126
00:13:46,867 --> 00:13:48,868
Did you see the locksmith bill?

127
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:56,709
You've reached
the Dane residence.

128
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:59,337
Please leave your name
after the beep.

129
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:01,172
Thank you, and God bless.

130
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:36,893
Here, looking for the base.

131
00:15:41,148 --> 00:15:43,733
Called safe
by the first base umpire.

132
00:15:44,735 --> 00:15:45,975
Got to try to catch him late...

133
00:15:45,999 --> 00:15:48,667
I guess he ran that all the way.

134
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:51,824
One and two...

135
00:15:54,828 --> 00:15:55,870
Outside...

136
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:43,584
Amen.

137
00:17:14,324 --> 00:17:17,160
So we got to get here
at 6:00 in the morning...

138
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:19,081
I am not getting here
at 6:00 in the morning...

139
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:22,874
Quiet and peaceful, isn't it?

140
00:17:31,633 --> 00:17:32,800
You're, uh,

141
00:17:32,801 --> 00:17:34,886
Dane, right?

142
00:17:37,806 --> 00:17:39,891
Come to watch the shit
go in the hole?

143
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:43,394
Very Christian of you.

144
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:51,611
I'm sure this doesn't make it
any better for you,

145
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:55,073
Mr. Russel,
but I'm sorry for what happened.

146
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:57,617
He didn't give me much choice.

147
00:18:03,707 --> 00:18:05,708
Yeah.

148
00:18:05,709 --> 00:18:08,044
You're right.

149
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:10,922
Doesn't make it any better.

150
00:18:14,718 --> 00:18:18,179
Oh, that was a nice picture
of your family in the paper.

151
00:18:20,015 --> 00:18:22,058
Your boy...

152
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:24,602
he looks a whole lot like you,
doesn't he?

153
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:30,900
Now, you have a nice day now,
you hear?

154
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:53,965
Yeah, it's Richard.
Is she free?

155
00:18:55,008 --> 00:18:56,134
Well... yeah, okay.

156
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:57,176
Tell her not to worry

157
00:18:57,177 --> 00:18:59,971
but to meet me
at the police station.

158
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:02,974
No, everything's fine.

159
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:20,158
Jordan, your dad's here.

160
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:23,578
- Come on back.
- Jordan.

161
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:25,830
Hey.
Jordan!

162
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:27,165
Jordan, hey.

163
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:28,666
Come on. Come on.

164
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:29,834
Come with me right now.

165
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:31,127
We're going.
Come with me.

166
00:19:31,128 --> 00:19:32,837
We're going.
Get in the car.

167
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:34,422
Come on, son.
Son, come on.

168
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:36,465
Get in the car.

169
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:56,819
Did he say anything to you
at the school?

170
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:58,154
No, he just waved.

171
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:01,199
- He waved?
- Yeah.

172
00:20:02,826 --> 00:20:04,466
So what do you want me
to do here, Rich?

173
00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:05,995
I want him arrested.

174
00:20:05,996 --> 00:20:07,163
For what?

175
00:20:07,164 --> 00:20:08,539
He hasn't done anything.

176
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:10,374
He threatened my son.

177
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:11,876
He said your boy looks like you.

178
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:12,960
It's not a threat.

179
00:20:12,961 --> 00:20:14,295
He showed up at Jordan's school.

180
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:15,976
In broad daylight,
in front of witnesses,

181
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,423
and did nothing.

182
00:20:17,424 --> 00:20:18,674
He wants my son.

183
00:20:18,675 --> 00:20:20,176
I know it.
I want protection.

184
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:21,219
That's not gonna happen,

185
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,887
not without a legal reason.

186
00:20:25,807 --> 00:20:27,892
I'll tell you what I'll do,
Rich.

187
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:30,645
Unofficially, I'll have a car
stop by your house

188
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:32,897
every couple hours
over the next few days,

189
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:34,523
give you a little peace of mind.

190
00:20:34,524 --> 00:20:36,734
He's probably just trying
to scare you.

191
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:38,736
Don't let him.

192
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,239
What were you thinking?

193
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,074
Richard.

194
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:44,242
Why even go there?

195
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:45,576
It was a mistake, okay?

196
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:46,661
I fucked up.

197
00:20:47,829 --> 00:20:49,080
I don't like that word,

198
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:50,248
not in front of Jordan.

199
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:54,585
What are we supposed to do now?

200
00:20:56,546 --> 00:20:58,422
Maybe you and Jordan
should stay at your mom's

201
00:20:58,423 --> 00:20:59,757
for a while
until this blows over.

202
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:02,051
What if he follows us there?

203
00:21:02,052 --> 00:21:04,762
I don't want to put her
in danger too.

204
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:07,723
What about your dad's cabin?

205
00:21:07,724 --> 00:21:09,350
No, it's too isolated.

206
00:21:09,351 --> 00:21:11,071
Besides, that's the last place
I want to be.

207
00:21:11,095 --> 00:21:13,062
I want a igloo colada.

208
00:21:13,063 --> 00:21:15,064
Son, don't talk
when other people are talking.

209
00:21:15,065 --> 00:21:16,107
It's not polite.

210
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:17,900
Eat your dinner.

211
00:21:17,901 --> 00:21:19,777
I say we stay home,

212
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:22,405
take Jordan out of school
for a little while,

213
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:24,448
let the cops handle it.

214
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:25,616
We wait him out.

215
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:27,535
We already got bars
on the windows and...

216
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:29,287
- But I don't want...
- Damn it, Jordan!

217
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:42,610
Get back in the car.

218
00:22:42,611 --> 00:22:44,278
What?

219
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:46,197
The lock's busted.

220
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:47,531
Oh, my God.

221
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:49,408
Go to the Fergusons'
and call the police.

222
00:22:49,409 --> 00:22:50,785
Ask for Price.

223
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:52,453
What are you doing?

224
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:55,831
Aren't you coming with us?

225
00:22:55,832 --> 00:22:58,084
- Richard, get in the car.
- Ann, get, now.

226
00:22:58,085 --> 00:22:59,168
Come with us.

227
00:22:59,169 --> 00:23:00,378
I said go.

228
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:02,213
- Richard, don't be stupid.
- Go, Ann.

229
00:24:39,644 --> 00:24:40,978
Whoever it was

230
00:24:40,979 --> 00:24:43,689
knows his way around
alarm systems.

231
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:45,399
We know who it was.

232
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,651
Excuse me, Detective.

233
00:24:50,363 --> 00:24:52,364
That goes for everybody.

234
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:57,161
I was wrong.

235
00:24:57,162 --> 00:24:58,454
I thought he'd move on,

236
00:24:58,455 --> 00:25:01,999
but at least we have
a reasonable suspicion now.

237
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,418
That means I can give you
official protection.

238
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:08,589
Now, all you got to do
is be normal...

239
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:10,257
go to work,
take Jordan to school,

240
00:25:10,258 --> 00:25:11,383
be seen.

241
00:25:11,384 --> 00:25:13,719
And everywhere you go,

242
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,054
I'll have someone watching.

243
00:25:15,055 --> 00:25:17,181
So when he makes his move,

244
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:19,099
we make our move.

245
00:25:20,477 --> 00:25:22,478
So we're the bait.

246
00:25:22,479 --> 00:25:24,522
For want of a better word, yeah.

247
00:25:26,691 --> 00:25:28,943
What do you say, Ann?

248
00:25:31,738 --> 00:25:33,989
Let's nail that son of a bitch.

249
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:42,122
I got men
hiding out in the woods.

250
00:25:42,123 --> 00:25:43,415
He sees me drive away,

251
00:25:43,416 --> 00:25:45,000
he's gonna think
you're here all alone.

252
00:25:45,001 --> 00:25:46,377
This is Kevin.

253
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:47,878
He's a good man,
ex-Special Forces.

254
00:25:47,879 --> 00:25:50,047
- Anyone see you come in here?
- Piece of cake.

255
00:25:50,048 --> 00:25:51,799
Kevin's gonna stay here with you.

256
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,884
For how long?

257
00:25:53,885 --> 00:25:55,678
As long as it takes.

258
00:25:57,305 --> 00:25:58,389
What do we do?

259
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:00,015
You go to bed.
Get some sleep.

260
00:26:00,016 --> 00:26:01,100
You're gonna need it.

261
00:26:39,347 --> 00:26:41,557
I like him when he's sleeping.

262
00:26:42,726 --> 00:26:44,101
Yeah.

263
00:26:44,102 --> 00:26:45,769
He's sweet.

264
00:27:32,942 --> 00:27:34,485
God damn...

265
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:18,899
It's one of the neighbors

266
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:21,026
looking for his dog, over.

267
00:30:25,031 --> 00:30:26,281
Any word?

268
00:30:26,282 --> 00:30:28,534
Nothing so far.

269
00:30:34,541 --> 00:30:36,166
Lieutenant, come in.

270
00:30:36,167 --> 00:30:37,292
Yeah. Price here.

271
00:30:38,378 --> 00:30:39,738
Lieutenant,
we just found his car

272
00:30:39,762 --> 00:30:41,387
about 1/4 mile south of you.

273
00:30:42,966 --> 00:30:44,299
Any sign of him?

274
00:30:46,761 --> 00:30:48,095
No.

275
00:30:48,096 --> 00:30:51,098
Well, fan out and see
if you can flush his ass.

276
00:32:09,344 --> 00:32:10,469
Kevin?

277
00:32:13,473 --> 00:32:15,390
He's in the fucking house!

278
00:32:15,391 --> 00:32:16,767
What the hell?

279
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:18,226
He's in the goddamn house!

280
00:32:18,227 --> 00:32:19,895
Jordan!

281
00:32:19,896 --> 00:32:21,396
Move! Go! Go!

282
00:32:21,397 --> 00:32:22,606
Haul your ass!

283
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:23,815
Price!

284
00:32:23,816 --> 00:32:25,692
Jordan?

285
00:32:27,403 --> 00:32:28,445
Get the door.

286
00:32:28,446 --> 00:32:30,030
- Let them in the door.
- Ah!

287
00:32:32,241 --> 00:32:34,159
The door's locked.
Somebody go around back.

288
00:32:36,329 --> 00:32:38,038
- I can't get it open!
- Open up, Ann!

289
00:32:42,543 --> 00:32:43,835
Jordan!

290
00:32:43,836 --> 00:32:45,629
Jordan!

291
00:32:48,049 --> 00:32:49,383
Oh.

292
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:52,344
He's in the woods.
Move. Move.

293
00:32:52,345 --> 00:32:54,554
Thank God.

294
00:32:54,555 --> 00:32:56,223
Oh!

295
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:11,154
Tracked him down to the river,

296
00:33:11,155 --> 00:33:12,656
but the rain's making it hard.

297
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:14,324
How'd he get in?

298
00:33:16,869 --> 00:33:18,149
How'd he get in the house, Ray?

299
00:33:19,247 --> 00:33:20,414
He never left.

300
00:33:20,415 --> 00:33:21,957
Son of a bitch
was in the crawl space

301
00:33:21,958 --> 00:33:24,251
the whole time.

302
00:33:24,252 --> 00:33:26,461
Jesus Christ.

303
00:33:28,047 --> 00:33:29,214
We'll get him, Rich.

304
00:33:30,383 --> 00:33:32,676
Don't you worry.

305
00:34:31,194 --> 00:34:33,111
Nuevo Laredo?

306
00:34:33,112 --> 00:34:35,155
Yep, piece of shit
went to Mexico.

307
00:34:35,156 --> 00:34:36,490
Mexico?

308
00:34:36,491 --> 00:34:38,241
Federales picked him up
across the border.

309
00:34:38,242 --> 00:34:39,534
We got him, Rich.

310
00:34:39,535 --> 00:34:41,286
Dragging him back to Huntsville
as we speak.

311
00:34:41,287 --> 00:34:44,331
His age, he'll never set foot
in this county again.

312
00:34:44,332 --> 00:34:45,999
Listen, uh,
we just wrapped the paperwork

313
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
on the Freddy file.

314
00:34:47,001 --> 00:34:48,251
Why don't you stop down

315
00:34:48,252 --> 00:34:49,586
and we'll close this out
for good?

316
00:34:49,587 --> 00:34:52,047
Then you owe me a beer,
compañero, okay?

317
00:34:52,048 --> 00:34:54,382
Okay.

318
00:35:20,993 --> 00:35:22,202
That's it.

319
00:35:22,203 --> 00:35:25,497
Sign these last two,
and you're on your way.

320
00:35:25,498 --> 00:35:26,998
All right.

321
00:36:08,916 --> 00:36:10,876
What's this?

322
00:36:12,295 --> 00:36:14,963
It says "Freddy Russell."

323
00:36:14,964 --> 00:36:16,548
So?

324
00:36:16,549 --> 00:36:18,592
So that's not the guy I shot.

325
00:36:18,593 --> 00:36:21,094
Is that some kind of mistake
or what?

326
00:36:23,431 --> 00:36:25,807
That's Freddy Russel.

327
00:36:25,808 --> 00:36:27,976
It's just a bad mug shot,
not very recent.

328
00:36:27,977 --> 00:36:30,145
People change, Rich.

329
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:32,814
Well, not that much.

330
00:36:32,815 --> 00:36:35,358
You were pretty upset
that night, remember?

331
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:38,653
Yeah, he died
right in front of me.

332
00:36:38,654 --> 00:36:41,281
I look at pictures of faces
all day.

333
00:36:41,282 --> 00:36:42,949
That is not the guy.

334
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:48,538
It's called shock, okay?

335
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:49,748
Memory gets a little fuzzy.

336
00:36:49,749 --> 00:36:50,832
It happens.

337
00:36:50,833 --> 00:36:52,792
Now, why don't you go home

338
00:36:52,793 --> 00:36:54,836
and let me deal
with the police work, huh?

339
00:36:57,924 --> 00:36:59,716
Give my regards to Ann, huh?

340
00:37:44,595 --> 00:37:46,763
Sheriff's offices.
Price here.

341
00:37:46,764 --> 00:37:47,889
Hey, Ray.

342
00:37:47,890 --> 00:37:50,558
This is Richard Dane.

343
00:37:50,559 --> 00:37:52,143
What is it, Rich?

344
00:37:53,479 --> 00:37:55,021
That wanted poster
is bugging me.

345
00:37:55,022 --> 00:37:56,940
It's not him, Ray.

346
00:37:56,941 --> 00:37:58,781
We've been through this.
It's late. I'm busy.

347
00:37:58,805 --> 00:38:00,652
Give it a rest.

348
00:38:00,653 --> 00:38:01,820
Well, just hear me out.

349
00:38:01,821 --> 00:38:03,113
I did, and you're wrong.

350
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:04,906
Case closed, over.
Now get some sleep.

351
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:24,676
<i>Sheriff's office.</i>

352
00:38:24,677 --> 00:38:27,387
Yeah, Lieutenant Price, please.

353
00:38:28,931 --> 00:38:30,890
<i>Sorry. He's not here, sir.</i>

354
00:38:30,891 --> 00:38:32,392
<i>Can I take a message?</i>

355
00:39:01,422 --> 00:39:03,089
Come on.
Bring him down here.

356
00:39:08,137 --> 00:39:10,138
Move along.

357
00:39:26,447 --> 00:39:27,906
Let's go.
Keep him quiet.

358
00:39:28,949 --> 00:39:29,991
That's it.

359
00:41:21,937 --> 00:41:23,521
Get him out.

360
00:41:35,117 --> 00:41:37,285
Get down.
Get down.

361
00:41:39,288 --> 00:41:40,455
That's good.
That's good.

362
00:41:41,790 --> 00:41:43,791
There you go.

363
00:41:43,792 --> 00:41:46,044
Going down.

364
00:41:54,553 --> 00:41:55,803
Get down.

365
00:41:58,057 --> 00:42:00,141
- Down.
- Get down.

366
00:46:07,055 --> 00:46:08,181
Whoa.

367
00:46:10,225 --> 00:46:12,727
What happened to your shoes?

368
00:46:12,728 --> 00:46:15,146
Oh.

369
00:46:15,147 --> 00:46:17,482
I drove out and checked
on the cabin yesterday.

370
00:46:17,483 --> 00:46:19,817
Must have stepped in some muck.

371
00:46:19,818 --> 00:46:21,444
I thought you didn't like
going there.

372
00:46:21,445 --> 00:46:22,612
Yeah, I know,

373
00:46:22,613 --> 00:46:25,406
but I figured
I got to clean it out sometime.

374
00:46:25,407 --> 00:46:26,491
And?

375
00:46:27,618 --> 00:46:29,869
My father
didn't leave much behind.

376
00:46:29,870 --> 00:46:31,746
There you go.

377
00:47:00,275 --> 00:47:01,317
Richard?

378
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:17,101
I didn't kill your son.

379
00:48:18,770 --> 00:48:19,979
Fuck you.

380
00:48:21,481 --> 00:48:23,481
Look, I think the cops
have been lying to us both

381
00:48:23,505 --> 00:48:25,526
all along.

382
00:48:25,527 --> 00:48:27,028
Where's my shoe?

383
00:48:39,499 --> 00:48:41,459
The cops are up to something,

384
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:42,460
right?

385
00:48:42,461 --> 00:48:44,086
Something to do with your son,

386
00:48:44,087 --> 00:48:46,255
with you.

387
00:48:47,215 --> 00:48:48,633
Why do they want you dead?

388
00:48:48,634 --> 00:48:49,967
How should I know?

389
00:48:49,968 --> 00:48:51,719
Same reason you do.

390
00:48:54,222 --> 00:48:55,389
Look.

391
00:48:58,101 --> 00:48:59,185
Something's going on.

392
00:49:00,771 --> 00:49:03,439
They used my family as bait

393
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:05,316
to find you.

394
00:49:05,317 --> 00:49:07,109
Now, I want to know why.

395
00:49:08,445 --> 00:49:09,779
Did you take my lighter?

396
00:49:11,782 --> 00:49:12,949
No.

397
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:14,450
Well, where is it?

398
00:49:32,552 --> 00:49:34,470
What's the matter?
You scared?

399
00:49:38,141 --> 00:49:39,433
Huh?

400
00:49:44,272 --> 00:49:46,857
When's the last time
you heard from your son?

401
00:49:49,778 --> 00:49:52,279
Oh, it's been a good long while.

402
00:49:53,949 --> 00:49:56,784
He was about the same age
as your boy.

403
00:50:12,801 --> 00:50:14,552
I could have left you
on those train tracks,

404
00:50:14,553 --> 00:50:15,678
but I didn't.

405
00:50:16,805 --> 00:50:19,056
I didn't kill your son.

406
00:50:19,057 --> 00:50:20,766
Who you gonna trust,

407
00:50:20,767 --> 00:50:23,769
the cops that just tried
to kill you or me?

408
00:50:24,813 --> 00:50:27,940
All I know is what I'm told.

409
00:50:30,777 --> 00:50:33,154
And I'm told I got nothing left.

410
00:50:33,155 --> 00:50:34,905
I didn't kill your son.

411
00:50:34,906 --> 00:50:36,490
So you say.

412
00:50:38,785 --> 00:50:40,411
Okay.

413
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:43,998
You're coming with me.

414
00:51:11,276 --> 00:51:12,902
Ah...

415
00:51:12,903 --> 00:51:13,986
Dig.

416
00:52:25,976 --> 00:52:28,102
Do it.

417
00:52:57,090 --> 00:52:59,049
Ugh. Jeez.

418
00:53:08,226 --> 00:53:10,102
That ain't him.
That's not Freddy.

419
00:53:16,693 --> 00:53:18,360
God...

420
00:53:21,489 --> 00:53:23,324
Jesus.
Who would do that?

421
00:53:25,827 --> 00:53:29,163
Somebody who didn't want him
identified, ever.

422
00:53:37,839 --> 00:53:39,965
Come on.
Get out of there.

423
00:53:56,483 --> 00:53:58,234
What do we do now?

424
00:53:58,235 --> 00:54:00,152
We?

425
00:54:03,281 --> 00:54:04,490
Yeah.

426
00:54:14,292 --> 00:54:16,126
I'll pay you back.

427
00:54:41,736 --> 00:54:44,238
- Hey.
Ben.

428
00:54:44,239 --> 00:54:45,656
Russel.

429
00:54:45,657 --> 00:54:46,657
Long time.

430
00:54:51,913 --> 00:54:53,998
I need some help.

431
00:54:53,999 --> 00:54:55,082
It's about my son.

432
00:55:29,784 --> 00:55:31,076
Good morning.

433
00:55:31,077 --> 00:55:32,786
Ray.

434
00:55:32,787 --> 00:55:33,996
You got a minute?

435
00:55:33,997 --> 00:55:35,289
Yeah.

436
00:55:35,290 --> 00:55:36,540
What do you need?

437
00:55:36,541 --> 00:55:38,421
I was wrong to hang up on you
the other night.

438
00:55:38,445 --> 00:55:40,321
I want to apologize.

439
00:55:41,671 --> 00:55:43,005
Oh, forget it.

440
00:55:43,006 --> 00:55:44,131
No, you were right.

441
00:55:44,132 --> 00:55:46,383
I was all worked up
over nothing.

442
00:55:46,384 --> 00:55:49,261
No, you were concerned,
and you were kind of right.

443
00:55:49,262 --> 00:55:50,471
See, Freddy...

444
00:55:50,472 --> 00:55:51,930
he was wanted.

445
00:55:51,931 --> 00:55:53,811
He dyed his hair.
He was wearing contact lenses.

446
00:55:53,835 --> 00:55:55,211
That's why you were confused.

447
00:55:58,646 --> 00:55:59,772
Well, I'm just glad

448
00:55:59,773 --> 00:56:01,190
his old man's headed back
to prison.

449
00:56:02,275 --> 00:56:03,400
Any day now.

450
00:56:07,113 --> 00:56:08,793
I'm sure you're doing
everything you can.

451
00:56:08,817 --> 00:56:10,491
I appreciate that.

452
00:56:10,492 --> 00:56:13,327
Important thing is, he's not
a threat anymore, right?

453
00:56:27,509 --> 00:56:28,801
Can I help you?

454
00:56:32,138 --> 00:56:34,306
You think you could corral
this little filly

455
00:56:34,307 --> 00:56:35,933
in a frame for me?

456
00:56:37,018 --> 00:56:39,269
Kind of a rush job.

457
00:56:40,814 --> 00:56:42,731
It don't have to be too fancy.

458
00:56:44,150 --> 00:56:45,859
You're busy, Rich.
I'll catch you.

459
00:56:45,860 --> 00:56:47,361
All right.

460
00:56:54,035 --> 00:56:55,702
- Sounds like old Ben's
got himself

461
00:56:55,703 --> 00:56:58,163
in a real shitstorm this time,

462
00:56:58,164 --> 00:57:01,166
and he's dragged you
right in there with him.

463
00:57:02,460 --> 00:57:04,044
Who are you?

464
00:57:04,045 --> 00:57:06,880
Name's Jim Bob Luke.

465
00:57:06,881 --> 00:57:08,006
Luke Detective Agency,

466
00:57:08,007 --> 00:57:10,467
Houston, Texas.

467
00:57:28,778 --> 00:57:31,655
This one made it all the way
to the Houston paper.

468
00:57:31,656 --> 00:57:32,823
Front page.

469
00:57:32,824 --> 00:57:35,159
Mentions Freddy four times,

470
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:37,244
just in case you missed it.

471
00:57:39,998 --> 00:57:42,249
This is six weeks ago.

472
00:57:42,250 --> 00:57:44,626
Buried on the back page.

473
00:57:44,627 --> 00:57:46,295
Mentions Freddy once.

474
00:57:47,464 --> 00:57:49,923
So he turned
state evidence, then?

475
00:57:49,924 --> 00:57:51,383
And your boy found himself

476
00:57:51,384 --> 00:57:53,260
on the ass end
of a federal case.

477
00:57:55,346 --> 00:57:58,891
Now, we know Freddy
ain't no saint,

478
00:57:58,892 --> 00:58:00,726
but if he's messing around
with these boys

479
00:58:00,727 --> 00:58:04,229
in the Dixie Mafia,
they some bad dudes.

480
00:58:04,230 --> 00:58:06,023
How far do you want
to take this, Ben?

481
00:58:15,742 --> 00:58:17,701
If he's alive,
I want to see him.

482
00:58:17,702 --> 00:58:18,785
All right.

483
00:58:18,786 --> 00:58:21,413
Well, I got some hunches
on that.

484
00:58:21,414 --> 00:58:23,916
I want to feel them out first.

485
00:58:23,917 --> 00:58:26,793
But first thing,
we got to relocate.

486
00:58:26,794 --> 00:58:30,088
If Price is as slick
as his mustache,

487
00:58:30,089 --> 00:58:32,966
we got to get the old hoss here
out of the county.

488
00:58:35,303 --> 00:58:36,678
What do I do?

489
00:58:36,679 --> 00:58:40,265
For now, just go home,
you know, act dumb.

490
00:58:40,266 --> 00:58:41,475
Let me do some legwork,

491
00:58:41,476 --> 00:58:43,644
and when I get Russel
settled somewhere,

492
00:58:43,645 --> 00:58:45,771
I'll... I'll give you a call.

493
00:58:50,610 --> 00:58:52,653
<i>Hey, thanks.
Thanks.</i>

494
00:58:52,654 --> 00:58:54,821
<i>Over here.</i>

495
00:58:54,822 --> 00:58:56,490
<i>Wanted to buy you a drink,
partner,</i>

496
00:58:56,491 --> 00:58:58,158
<i>for bringing Holly back
in one piece.</i>

497
00:58:58,159 --> 00:58:59,284
<i>Yeah.</i>

498
00:58:59,285 --> 00:59:00,702
<i>Last time, he blacked her eye.</i>

499
00:59:00,703 --> 00:59:02,204
<i>Someday,
someone's gonna settle...</i>

500
00:59:04,332 --> 00:59:05,999
<i>I'd like to do it myself.</i>

501
00:59:07,752 --> 00:59:09,336
<i>At one time, a Singapore Sling</i>

502
00:59:09,337 --> 00:59:10,629
<i>would have been the only answer.</i>

503
00:59:36,948 --> 00:59:38,365
What?
No, no, no, no.

504
00:59:38,366 --> 00:59:40,617
Say that again.
You broke up.

505
00:59:41,703 --> 00:59:43,370
I-I can't...

506
00:59:43,371 --> 00:59:45,372
No, I'm...
I'm catching every third word.

507
00:59:45,373 --> 00:59:46,540
Say it again.

508
00:59:46,541 --> 00:59:48,041
Here you go.

509
00:59:52,005 --> 00:59:54,006
All right, thanks.

510
00:59:57,302 --> 00:59:58,510
What'd you find out?

511
00:59:58,511 --> 01:00:00,512
Well, I made a bunch of calls.

512
01:00:00,513 --> 01:00:02,889
I got this gal
I used to run with.

513
01:00:02,890 --> 01:00:05,934
She works in the office
of the FBI.

514
01:00:05,935 --> 01:00:07,728
It seems Freddy

515
01:00:07,729 --> 01:00:10,689
is assigned to
the witness relocation program.

516
01:00:10,690 --> 01:00:11,982
You know what that is?

517
01:00:11,983 --> 01:00:15,527
They give people a new start,
new name, new place...

518
01:00:15,528 --> 01:00:16,737
mob informers and shit.

519
01:00:16,738 --> 01:00:19,740
Yeah, you got the picture,
framer.

520
01:00:19,741 --> 01:00:21,992
They're the ones
that set you up.

521
01:00:21,993 --> 01:00:24,077
So over the last couple years,

522
01:00:24,078 --> 01:00:26,455
your son's been running
with the Dixie boys,

523
01:00:26,456 --> 01:00:29,875
doing whatever Mafia types do.

524
01:00:29,876 --> 01:00:32,377
And the shit gets
way over Freddy's head,

525
01:00:32,378 --> 01:00:35,130
and the law
comes down on him hard.

526
01:00:35,131 --> 01:00:37,090
So to keep from going
to the slammer,

527
01:00:37,091 --> 01:00:39,051
he starts to sing
like a little bird

528
01:00:39,052 --> 01:00:42,179
against his old buddies,
the Dixie boys.

529
01:00:42,180 --> 01:00:45,724
Now, you don't want to fuck
with the Dixie Mafia.

530
01:00:45,725 --> 01:00:49,478
And the feds know that,
so they make Freddy a deal.

531
01:00:49,479 --> 01:00:52,022
They'll hide him
if he gives them what they need.

532
01:00:52,023 --> 01:00:54,066
So they faked it.

533
01:00:54,067 --> 01:00:55,942
It's beautiful.

534
01:00:55,943 --> 01:00:59,321
If the Dixie Mafia believes
that Freddy is dead, well...

535
01:01:00,657 --> 01:01:03,283
What's the use of gunning
for a dead guy, right?

536
01:01:03,284 --> 01:01:05,327
Good plan, don't you think?

537
01:01:07,872 --> 01:01:09,247
Then who's in that grave?

538
01:01:09,248 --> 01:01:11,083
Yeah, and where's my son?

539
01:01:13,336 --> 01:01:15,629
Well, that's a good one.

540
01:01:17,715 --> 01:01:18,965
Oh!

541
01:01:18,966 --> 01:01:20,467
That would be for me.

542
01:01:20,468 --> 01:01:22,052
These things are amazing.

543
01:01:22,053 --> 01:01:23,261
You seen these?

544
01:01:23,262 --> 01:01:24,888
Ah, fuck, you've been
in prison forever.

545
01:01:24,889 --> 01:01:25,972
Jim Bob.

546
01:01:25,973 --> 01:01:28,016
You're breaking up.
Hold on.

547
01:01:30,937 --> 01:01:33,105
Okay, that's better.
Go ahead.

548
01:01:33,106 --> 01:01:34,773
You should really be scared...

549
01:01:34,774 --> 01:01:38,110
I need another beer.

550
01:01:45,118 --> 01:01:47,744
Well, if it ain't Josey Wales.

551
01:01:47,745 --> 01:01:51,623
Hey, kill any banditos lately,
cowboy?

552
01:01:51,624 --> 01:01:53,750
Jack, you're drunk.
Leave me alone.

553
01:01:53,751 --> 01:01:55,585
Ah, let me buy you a drink.

554
01:01:55,586 --> 01:01:57,963
And you can tell me
about how you...

555
01:01:57,964 --> 01:01:59,214
I don't want your drink, Jack,

556
01:01:59,215 --> 01:02:00,549
and I don't want your company.

557
01:02:00,550 --> 01:02:03,552
Let me tell you something,
Mr. Dane...

558
01:02:03,553 --> 01:02:05,303
Ahh!
Oh, God!

559
01:02:06,389 --> 01:02:07,639
Hurts, doesn't it?

560
01:02:10,226 --> 01:02:12,185
Hey. Hey. Let him go.

561
01:02:12,186 --> 01:02:13,311
It's not a good idea.

562
01:02:23,156 --> 01:02:25,282
You didn't have to do that.

563
01:02:27,785 --> 01:02:30,370
Well, I didn't want to see you
damage the fella.

564
01:02:31,372 --> 01:02:33,206
Can we get three beers?

565
01:02:35,585 --> 01:02:37,127
<i>In Washington,</i>

566
01:02:37,128 --> 01:02:40,881
<i>it has been established that
persons who have recently died</i>

567
01:02:40,882 --> 01:02:45,635
<i>have been returning to life
and committing acts of murder.</i>

568
01:02:45,636 --> 01:02:48,638
<i>Widespread investigation
of morgues and funeral homes...</i>

569
01:02:48,639 --> 01:02:51,141
Hoss, if you want to see your boy,

570
01:02:51,142 --> 01:02:53,810
we got to move.

571
01:02:53,811 --> 01:02:55,228
You can stay at my place.

572
01:02:55,229 --> 01:02:57,189
Human victims...

573
01:02:57,190 --> 01:02:59,941
Y'all are leaving?

574
01:02:59,942 --> 01:03:01,526
This whole operation's being run

575
01:03:01,527 --> 01:03:04,070
out of the Houston office.

576
01:03:04,071 --> 01:03:06,615
That's my hood.

577
01:03:06,616 --> 01:03:08,742
Freddy will be close by.

578
01:03:08,743 --> 01:03:09,785
Behind locked doors...

579
01:03:09,786 --> 01:03:11,119
I'm going with you.

580
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:13,246
That situation has now changed,

581
01:03:13,247 --> 01:03:15,165
and we're able to report
a definite...

582
01:03:15,166 --> 01:03:16,666
I still don't know who I shot.

583
01:03:16,667 --> 01:03:17,751
Civil defense machinery

584
01:03:17,752 --> 01:03:19,586
has been organized

585
01:03:19,587 --> 01:03:21,713
to provide rescue stations
with food, shelter...

586
01:03:21,714 --> 01:03:23,215
I have to tell my wife
something.

587
01:03:23,216 --> 01:03:25,091
And protection
by armed National Guardsmen.

588
01:03:25,092 --> 01:03:26,218
I don't know.

589
01:03:26,219 --> 01:03:28,261
Seems kind of sudden,
doesn't it?

590
01:03:28,262 --> 01:03:31,765
Well, this is a good
opportunity for the shop.

591
01:03:31,766 --> 01:03:34,100
Uh, have you been drinking?

592
01:03:35,436 --> 01:03:36,796
Yeah, I stopped
and had a couple.

593
01:03:36,820 --> 01:03:38,021
I'm celebrating.

594
01:03:38,022 --> 01:03:42,025
If I get this contract,
well, it'd be big.

595
01:03:43,444 --> 01:03:45,237
You're serious about this,
aren't you?

596
01:03:45,238 --> 01:03:47,280
Mm-hmm.

597
01:03:47,281 --> 01:03:49,074
Well, how long
will you be gone for?

598
01:03:49,075 --> 01:03:52,410
Just a couple days,
no more than a week, I figure.

599
01:03:52,411 --> 01:03:53,912
I don't know.

600
01:03:53,913 --> 01:03:55,673
I don't like the idea
of you going to Houston

601
01:03:55,697 --> 01:03:57,123
and leaving me and Jordan
all alone.

602
01:03:57,124 --> 01:03:58,500
Well, they got him, Ann.

603
01:03:58,501 --> 01:04:00,210
Don't make me sound girly.

604
01:04:00,211 --> 01:04:01,711
Well, don't act girly.

605
01:04:01,712 --> 01:04:04,130
Don't tease me, Richard.

606
01:04:04,131 --> 01:04:05,841
Well, you should be happy.

607
01:04:05,842 --> 01:04:10,178
I've been waiting
for something big like this.

608
01:04:10,179 --> 01:04:13,265
Well, will it stop you
from moping around the house?

609
01:04:15,601 --> 01:04:17,477
Maybe we can go
on a vacation after,

610
01:04:17,478 --> 01:04:18,812
someplace cool?

611
01:04:18,813 --> 01:04:20,564
It's been a while
since we've been away.

612
01:04:20,565 --> 01:04:21,690
Yeah.

613
01:04:21,691 --> 01:04:23,233
We could drop Jordan
at your mom's

614
01:04:23,234 --> 01:04:25,819
and have us a little adult time.

615
01:04:27,488 --> 01:04:30,156
Hmm?

616
01:04:30,157 --> 01:04:32,242
You want to do it, Sparky?

617
01:04:35,371 --> 01:04:37,581
You haven't called me that
since high school.

618
01:04:37,582 --> 01:04:40,000
- Mm.
- You are drunk.

619
01:04:40,001 --> 01:04:41,001
Drunk and randy...

620
01:04:41,002 --> 01:04:42,669
I thought
that's how you like me.

621
01:05:28,257 --> 01:05:30,258
Let's get us some java.

622
01:05:50,196 --> 01:05:51,863
When you said
he was a pig farmer,

623
01:05:51,864 --> 01:05:53,615
I thought you were kidding.

624
01:05:53,616 --> 01:05:55,325
Morning, boys.

625
01:05:55,326 --> 01:05:58,078
Come on in,
and I'll make you some bacon.

626
01:06:00,164 --> 01:06:04,459
The DMV issued
162 new driver's licenses

627
01:06:04,460 --> 01:06:06,670
to males in Freddy's age range.

628
01:06:06,671 --> 01:06:08,004
Out of that stack,

629
01:06:08,005 --> 01:06:10,048
93 of them poor bastards
is married.

630
01:06:10,049 --> 01:06:14,260
So of the single dudes,
47 of 'em is Caucasian,

631
01:06:14,261 --> 01:06:16,012
and a whole of 28

632
01:06:16,013 --> 01:06:17,514
around 6 feet tall.

633
01:06:17,515 --> 01:06:19,599
Well, any of 'em got blue eyes?

634
01:06:19,600 --> 01:06:21,643
Grand total of two.

635
01:06:21,644 --> 01:06:23,979
Well, what about them?
Why don't we start with them?

636
01:06:23,980 --> 01:06:25,021
Already did.

637
01:06:25,022 --> 01:06:26,481
Well, at least the first one.

638
01:06:28,109 --> 01:06:29,150
And?

639
01:06:29,151 --> 01:06:30,318
That sorry son of a bitch

640
01:06:30,319 --> 01:06:33,321
still lives with his parents.

641
01:06:33,322 --> 01:06:35,031
But the other one...

642
01:06:35,032 --> 01:06:36,908
this one right here...

643
01:06:36,909 --> 01:06:39,202
one Frank C. Miller,

644
01:06:39,203 --> 01:06:41,079
blond, blue-eyed,

645
01:06:41,080 --> 01:06:42,789
6 feet and change,

646
01:06:42,790 --> 01:06:45,291
the same Mr. Miller

647
01:06:45,292 --> 01:06:47,961
who just ordered cable
and a phone line

648
01:06:47,962 --> 01:06:50,463
at his new house
outside of Houston.

649
01:06:50,464 --> 01:06:53,133
And previous address unknown.

650
01:06:53,134 --> 01:06:55,343
That's not bad for a pig farmer.

651
01:06:56,637 --> 01:06:58,471
Well, when I crack this case,

652
01:06:58,472 --> 01:07:01,558
I might just let you
frame the headlines, framer.

653
01:07:01,559 --> 01:07:04,269
Best way to find out for sure...

654
01:07:04,270 --> 01:07:05,687
call him.

655
01:07:05,688 --> 01:07:08,106
No, I want to take a look
at him first.

656
01:07:08,107 --> 01:07:09,566
Come on, you cranky old bastard.

657
01:07:09,567 --> 01:07:11,359
Just call him up.

658
01:07:13,070 --> 01:07:15,280
I ain't calling him.

659
01:07:18,159 --> 01:07:20,994
That's the house right there.

660
01:07:20,995 --> 01:07:23,830
That's not the color I pictured.

661
01:07:23,831 --> 01:07:27,333
Well, we're not even sure
it's him yet, are we?

662
01:07:27,334 --> 01:07:30,336
No better time than the present.

663
01:07:30,337 --> 01:07:32,422
You make it sound like
it's some kind of showdown.

664
01:07:32,423 --> 01:07:33,840
Well, in a way, it is.

665
01:07:33,841 --> 01:07:35,081
- I have to make...
- Watch out!

666
01:07:35,926 --> 01:07:37,677
- Ah! Shit!
- Damn!

667
01:07:37,678 --> 01:07:39,596
What the fuck?

668
01:07:39,597 --> 01:07:40,847
Jesus!

669
01:07:42,600 --> 01:07:46,061
What in the dog shit
is wrong with you?

670
01:07:46,062 --> 01:07:48,938
Don't you have any mirrors
on this damn Pinto?

671
01:07:48,939 --> 01:07:50,356
Do you know how to use them?

672
01:07:50,357 --> 01:07:52,108
Who's gonna pay for...

673
01:07:52,109 --> 01:07:53,526
we could split it.

674
01:07:53,527 --> 01:07:54,527
Ah!

675
01:07:54,528 --> 01:07:56,362
Oh!

676
01:07:56,363 --> 01:07:58,156
You... ah!

677
01:07:58,157 --> 01:07:59,657
Hey!

678
01:08:00,743 --> 01:08:02,494
You want some of this?

679
01:08:02,495 --> 01:08:03,828
Huh?

680
01:08:07,500 --> 01:08:08,833
That's for my car.

681
01:08:12,671 --> 01:08:14,964
And that's for my hat.

682
01:08:14,965 --> 01:08:17,133
Ben, check him.

683
01:08:17,134 --> 01:08:20,136
God damn.

684
01:08:20,137 --> 01:08:21,763
Tore my fucking head off.

685
01:08:26,393 --> 01:08:28,353
It ain't Frankie Miller, is it?

686
01:08:28,354 --> 01:08:30,480
No, smart-ass.

687
01:08:34,401 --> 01:08:35,693
Huh.

688
01:08:35,694 --> 01:08:38,905
Good thing he wasn't in
an OK Corral mood.

689
01:08:38,906 --> 01:08:41,366
Goddamn piece of shit Pinto!

690
01:08:46,288 --> 01:08:48,164
What's that?

691
01:08:48,165 --> 01:08:50,291
Home movies, looks like.

692
01:08:50,292 --> 01:08:52,210
Shut up!

693
01:08:52,211 --> 01:08:54,087
Ah, he's moving.

694
01:08:57,550 --> 01:08:59,759
"Batting Practice"?

695
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:06,015
Let's get a look at his swing.

696
01:09:07,977 --> 01:09:11,437
Take that gun and shoot
that fucking dog, will you?

697
01:09:51,645 --> 01:09:53,813
She's cute, man.

698
01:09:54,982 --> 01:09:56,316
Is this your first...

699
01:09:56,317 --> 01:09:58,359
ask her if this
is her first time.

700
01:10:02,781 --> 01:10:03,823
Hey, it's me.

701
01:10:03,824 --> 01:10:06,201
Uh, I'm in Houston,

702
01:10:06,202 --> 01:10:07,327
and everything's fine.

703
01:10:07,328 --> 01:10:08,661
I got a meeting
in a little while.

704
01:10:08,662 --> 01:10:11,080
I'll call you later
and let you know how it went.

705
01:10:11,081 --> 01:10:13,082
Yeah, there you go.

706
01:10:13,083 --> 01:10:14,334
Okay.
Love you both.

707
01:10:14,335 --> 01:10:16,252
Get on top of him.

708
01:10:16,253 --> 01:10:19,380
Yeah, I like that.
Yeah.

709
01:10:23,510 --> 01:10:26,554
How old... how old are you?

710
01:10:27,723 --> 01:10:29,974
She ain't even old enough
to drive.

711
01:10:29,975 --> 01:10:31,768
What did she say?

712
01:11:42,214 --> 01:11:43,589
So he's a pervert.

713
01:11:43,590 --> 01:11:45,258
Let's turn this shit off.

714
01:12:20,252 --> 01:12:22,170
Whoo!

715
01:12:22,171 --> 01:12:24,088
Yeah!

716
01:12:29,178 --> 01:12:30,678
Hello?

717
01:12:32,306 --> 01:12:33,973
Hello?

718
01:12:36,727 --> 01:12:38,144
Hello?

719
01:12:53,702 --> 01:12:55,787
Let's tell him
we got the wrong house

720
01:12:55,788 --> 01:12:58,456
and we can't find the guy
or some shit.

721
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,043
What about Freddy?

722
01:13:03,879 --> 01:13:06,589
You saw that trunk.

723
01:13:06,590 --> 01:13:09,092
There are a lot more tapes
where that one came from.

724
01:13:10,761 --> 01:13:11,928
Doesn't that matter to you?

725
01:13:11,929 --> 01:13:13,679
Well, yeah,

726
01:13:13,680 --> 01:13:16,307
it matters to me.

727
01:13:16,308 --> 01:13:20,353
But we can't tell Ben
about any of it, not yet.

728
01:13:20,354 --> 01:13:21,771
About what?

729
01:13:28,904 --> 01:13:31,906
It ain't nothing
we need to jump into right now.

730
01:13:31,907 --> 01:13:34,283
What's on the tape?

731
01:13:40,457 --> 01:13:42,458
What's on the tape?

732
01:13:44,044 --> 01:13:46,003
Do yourself a favor, hoss.

733
01:13:48,382 --> 01:13:50,383
What's on the tape?

734
01:13:50,384 --> 01:13:52,260
Huh?

735
01:14:07,734 --> 01:14:09,735
How do you work
this fucking thing?

736
01:14:23,959 --> 01:14:25,877
She's cute, man.

737
01:14:25,878 --> 01:14:26,961
Is this your first...

738
01:14:26,962 --> 01:14:28,754
ask her if this
is her first time.

739
01:15:05,834 --> 01:15:07,585
Ben?

740
01:15:07,586 --> 01:15:09,962
Ben?

741
01:15:09,963 --> 01:15:11,339
Hey.

742
01:15:14,176 --> 01:15:16,344
Open the door.

743
01:15:18,430 --> 01:15:19,805
Open the door, Ben.

744
01:15:19,806 --> 01:15:21,849
Put the gun down.

745
01:15:23,435 --> 01:15:26,771
Would you put the gun down, Ben?

746
01:16:26,456 --> 01:16:28,958
We could go to the cops

747
01:16:28,959 --> 01:16:31,836
and show them the tape.

748
01:16:34,339 --> 01:16:37,174
Well, it wouldn't do any good.

749
01:16:37,175 --> 01:16:40,219
They know what their boy
is doing.

750
01:16:40,220 --> 01:16:43,639
He is protected.

751
01:16:43,640 --> 01:16:45,725
But he's killing women.

752
01:16:45,726 --> 01:16:48,060
Prostitutes who cross
the border illegally,

753
01:16:48,061 --> 01:16:50,229
and nobody cares.

754
01:16:54,484 --> 01:16:56,277
How long you known him?

755
01:16:58,947 --> 01:17:01,365
We were in Korea together.

756
01:17:03,660 --> 01:17:05,661
He saved my life.

757
01:17:08,582 --> 01:17:12,251
He never said
he was in the service.

758
01:17:14,087 --> 01:17:15,887
I don't know whether
you've noticed it or not,

759
01:17:15,911 --> 01:17:19,872
but old Ben ain't much
on the small talk, is he?

760
01:17:22,512 --> 01:17:25,348
Stubborn as a mule, though.

761
01:17:25,349 --> 01:17:27,558
Get some rest, boy.

762
01:17:30,979 --> 01:17:33,230
All right.

763
01:17:58,131 --> 01:17:59,173
What the fuck?

764
01:18:16,983 --> 01:18:19,485
I got cows in that pasture.

765
01:18:27,077 --> 01:18:30,496
What are you gonna do
when a dog goes bad on you,

766
01:18:30,497 --> 01:18:33,249
bites somebody
or hurts somebody?

767
01:18:34,459 --> 01:18:36,919
There's only two things
you can do, right?

768
01:18:37,963 --> 01:18:41,799
You either chain him up
or put him down.

769
01:18:43,301 --> 01:18:46,178
But which do you think
is more cruel?

770
01:18:46,179 --> 01:18:47,680
Huh?

771
01:18:49,266 --> 01:18:50,933
You talking about killing
your own son?

772
01:18:50,934 --> 01:18:52,935
That's crazy.

773
01:18:54,980 --> 01:18:56,439
Well...

774
01:18:57,733 --> 01:19:01,193
I can't very well
chain him up, can I?

775
01:19:10,036 --> 01:19:11,203
I need a drink.

776
01:19:12,581 --> 01:19:16,584
Haven't even had
my goddamn coffee yet.

777
01:19:16,585 --> 01:19:18,753
Son of a bitch.

778
01:19:36,688 --> 01:19:37,772
Thank you, darling.

779
01:19:37,773 --> 01:19:39,231
You got it, baby.

780
01:19:39,232 --> 01:19:40,900
Have you given any thought

781
01:19:40,901 --> 01:19:43,527
as to how you're gonna do
this thing?

782
01:19:43,528 --> 01:19:45,404
Well, it ain't rocket science.

783
01:19:48,074 --> 01:19:49,950
What about the big Mex?

784
01:19:49,951 --> 01:19:52,244
If he's there,
we'll shoot him too.

785
01:19:52,245 --> 01:19:53,287
Oh, good.

786
01:19:53,288 --> 01:19:54,872
Well, I'm glad you got a plan.

787
01:19:54,873 --> 01:19:57,792
I was worried that
you were just gonna wing it.

788
01:19:57,793 --> 01:19:59,835
You got a better idea?

789
01:19:59,836 --> 01:20:01,337
Not yet,

790
01:20:01,338 --> 01:20:03,005
but I'm working on it.

791
01:20:03,006 --> 01:20:05,257
Just remember, he's my son,

792
01:20:05,258 --> 01:20:07,218
and I'm pulling the trigger.

793
01:20:27,280 --> 01:20:28,656
Good luck.

794
01:21:18,957 --> 01:21:20,332
Hey, there.

795
01:21:20,333 --> 01:21:21,542
Hey.

796
01:21:30,176 --> 01:21:31,552
Ho! Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.

797
01:21:31,553 --> 01:21:33,012
Honey, I'm sorry.
I didn't see you.

798
01:21:33,013 --> 01:21:34,054
That's okay.

799
01:21:34,055 --> 01:21:35,139
- Sorry.
- That's okay.

800
01:21:36,308 --> 01:21:38,017
- Okay, ice cream?
- No.

801
01:21:38,018 --> 01:21:39,351
- No?
- Potato sauce.

802
01:21:39,352 --> 01:21:40,811
Potato sauce?

803
01:21:42,856 --> 01:21:44,523
And his low throw allows...

804
01:21:44,524 --> 01:21:46,400
Glad the trip went well.

805
01:21:46,401 --> 01:21:48,360
I hope you get the contract.

806
01:21:48,361 --> 01:21:49,945
What?

807
01:21:49,946 --> 01:21:52,698
I said I'm glad
the trip went well.

808
01:21:52,699 --> 01:21:54,158
Man on first and third...

809
01:21:54,159 --> 01:21:55,159
Oh.

810
01:21:55,160 --> 01:21:56,243
Takes the plate.

811
01:21:59,915 --> 01:22:02,207
Here it comes,
the two-and-two pitch.

812
01:22:03,209 --> 01:22:04,710
Hits it sharp!

813
01:22:04,711 --> 01:22:07,630
Going back! Going back!

814
01:22:07,631 --> 01:22:08,881
It's out of here!

815
01:22:08,882 --> 01:22:10,549
I'll tell you...

816
01:23:06,356 --> 01:23:07,606
Call.

817
01:23:11,903 --> 01:23:13,904
What do you got?

818
01:23:19,536 --> 01:23:21,245
Show 'em.

819
01:23:21,246 --> 01:23:23,247
Framer's back.

820
01:24:35,487 --> 01:24:37,613
Well, how about that?

821
01:24:37,614 --> 01:24:40,032
The video store is a cover.

822
01:24:40,033 --> 01:24:42,910
Your boy's got more brains
than you do, Ben.

823
01:24:42,911 --> 01:24:44,912
Must take after his mama.

824
01:24:49,667 --> 01:24:53,295
Okay, framer, go in there
and look for exit doors

825
01:24:53,296 --> 01:24:54,713
and side rooms,
things like that.

826
01:24:54,714 --> 01:24:55,798
You got it?

827
01:24:55,799 --> 01:24:58,467
And just act normal, all right?

828
01:24:59,469 --> 01:25:01,136
What about the Mexican?

829
01:25:01,137 --> 01:25:03,555
Just be quick about it.

830
01:25:12,774 --> 01:25:14,691
Okay, okay.

831
01:25:17,695 --> 01:25:18,737
Hey.

832
01:25:18,738 --> 01:25:19,947
Hey.

833
01:26:13,084 --> 01:26:16,378
Is there something
I can help you with, sir?

834
01:26:20,133 --> 01:26:21,758
Yeah, uh...

835
01:26:23,595 --> 01:26:25,596
You have
a foreign films section?

836
01:26:25,597 --> 01:26:28,932
Don't carry nothing foreign
but Jap and Mex stuff.

837
01:26:31,686 --> 01:26:35,522
Uh, that's right,
just Japanese and Mexican fare,

838
01:26:35,523 --> 01:26:36,690
uh, some British too.

839
01:26:36,691 --> 01:26:37,900
We got limey stuff?

840
01:26:39,110 --> 01:26:41,310
George, I prefer you not use
offensive terms like that

841
01:26:41,334 --> 01:26:42,988
if you're gonna work for me,
okay?

842
01:26:42,989 --> 01:26:44,781
Yes, sir.
I didn't mean nothing by it.

843
01:26:44,782 --> 01:26:46,158
Sorry.
Uh...

844
01:26:46,159 --> 01:26:47,659
It's all right.

845
01:26:47,660 --> 01:26:50,162
Is there anything else
that I can help you with today?

846
01:26:51,664 --> 01:26:52,998
Uh...

847
01:26:54,459 --> 01:26:56,960
Yeah, uh, what time y'all close?

848
01:26:56,961 --> 01:26:58,629
11:00 p.m., sharp.

849
01:27:02,717 --> 01:27:03,884
Shit.

850
01:27:05,053 --> 01:27:06,136
All right.

851
01:27:06,137 --> 01:27:07,262
Chicken?

852
01:27:07,263 --> 01:27:09,890
No, they out of the chicken...
only beef.

853
01:27:09,891 --> 01:27:12,017
Oh, actually, hey, you know,

854
01:27:12,018 --> 01:27:14,353
I just got this new release in
from, uh...

855
01:27:14,354 --> 01:27:15,354
what...

856
01:27:24,530 --> 01:27:25,656
You all right?

857
01:27:25,657 --> 01:27:27,658
Yeah.

858
01:27:29,202 --> 01:27:31,995
They close at 11:00.

859
01:27:41,047 --> 01:27:43,048
Ben.

860
01:27:48,388 --> 01:27:50,222
Eenie, meenie.

861
01:27:57,313 --> 01:28:00,315
Here.
Just in case.

862
01:29:41,751 --> 01:29:43,585
All right, that's them.

863
01:29:44,879 --> 01:29:46,088
Let's make this quick.

864
01:29:46,089 --> 01:29:48,298
Just tell us when.

865
01:29:50,009 --> 01:29:53,011
Oh, shit, shit, shit.

866
01:30:07,193 --> 01:30:10,028
Oh, fuck.
They got company.

867
01:30:20,373 --> 01:30:22,541
I don't like this.

868
01:30:29,132 --> 01:30:30,799
Let's take 'em all on.

869
01:30:30,800 --> 01:30:32,926
- There's six of 'em, Ben.
- Ooh!

870
01:30:32,927 --> 01:30:34,845
We don't know how many more
are on the inside.

871
01:30:34,846 --> 01:30:36,221
Ah, fuck 'em.

872
01:30:37,598 --> 01:30:38,682
Ben.

873
01:30:42,395 --> 01:30:44,479
We're gonna do this
the right way.

874
01:30:44,480 --> 01:30:46,231
Are you feeling me, Ben?

875
01:30:48,484 --> 01:30:52,070
Take the gun out of my ear, Jim.

876
01:30:52,071 --> 01:30:54,072
I'm feeling you.

877
01:30:55,074 --> 01:30:56,408
Wait. Look.

878
01:31:01,998 --> 01:31:03,999
All right, see ya.

879
01:31:08,754 --> 01:31:10,046
What do we do?

880
01:31:10,047 --> 01:31:12,257
Follow 'em.

881
01:31:19,098 --> 01:31:20,849
All right.

882
01:32:22,036 --> 01:32:24,996
This must be where they do it.

883
01:32:24,997 --> 01:32:27,916
Lot of cowboys down there, Ben.

884
01:32:27,917 --> 01:32:29,876
You want to rethink your math?

885
01:32:29,877 --> 01:32:31,795
Fuck the math.

886
01:32:44,809 --> 01:32:47,435
Looks like there's only
gonna be one left outside.

887
01:32:47,436 --> 01:32:49,938
That means five on the inside,
plus the girl.

888
01:32:49,939 --> 01:32:51,106
Count to ten,

889
01:32:51,107 --> 01:32:52,190
and then one of you

890
01:32:52,191 --> 01:32:53,942
step out and get his attention.

891
01:32:53,943 --> 01:32:55,485
I'll do the rest.

892
01:32:57,863 --> 01:33:02,576
Ten, nine, eight,

893
01:33:02,577 --> 01:33:04,536
seven, six...

894
01:33:04,537 --> 01:33:06,371
You're actually counting?

895
01:33:06,372 --> 01:33:08,039
He... he said to count.

896
01:33:08,040 --> 01:33:09,499
Damn.

897
01:33:12,003 --> 01:33:13,587
Oh, shit.

898
01:33:19,051 --> 01:33:21,052
Hey.

899
01:33:21,053 --> 01:33:22,220
Hey.

900
01:33:33,774 --> 01:33:36,109
All right, boys,

901
01:33:36,110 --> 01:33:38,111
it's Howdy Doody time.

902
01:34:40,174 --> 01:34:41,716
Hey, hey.

903
01:35:01,195 --> 01:35:03,697
I'll be upstairs.
Yeah, I'll be upstairs.

904
01:35:07,118 --> 01:35:09,244
This guy...
so I told you I'm coming.

905
01:35:09,245 --> 01:35:10,662
Hold on.

906
01:35:14,250 --> 01:35:16,084
- Tell me again.
- I told you already.

907
01:35:16,085 --> 01:35:17,085
Get me a drink.

908
01:35:24,301 --> 01:35:25,719
What was that?

909
01:35:25,720 --> 01:35:27,053
Get your ass back down here!

910
01:35:59,295 --> 01:36:01,171
No! No, no.

911
01:37:23,462 --> 01:37:24,921
Ah!

912
01:37:24,922 --> 01:37:27,257
Ah! Fuck!

913
01:37:27,258 --> 01:37:29,384
Ah!
Fucking shot...

914

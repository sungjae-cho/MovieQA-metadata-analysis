1
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:20,674
What are you doing?
We don't stop here.

2
00:05:32,783 --> 00:05:35,036
Get out of the car.

3
00:09:14,901 --> 00:09:19,872
The boys found this on the floor,
in the back of the Caddy.

4
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:22,657
Yeah, they showed me.

5
00:09:24,609 --> 00:09:27,041
Could be unrelated.

6
00:09:27,254 --> 00:09:29,057
Could be.

7
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:32,811
Any of those dead kids
wearing pearl earrings?

8
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:34,833
No.

9
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:39,218
Could be someone's missing, maybe.

10
00:09:40,301 --> 00:09:42,483
That’s what I'm thinking.

11
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,705
Just one more bag after that.

12
00:12:08,415 --> 00:12:10,325
I just wanted to come here.

13
00:12:11,895 --> 00:12:13,840
To Winkie's?

14
00:12:14,469 --> 00:12:16,094
This Winkie's.

15
00:12:17,114 --> 00:12:20,863
Okay. Why this Winkie's?

16
00:12:24,768 --> 00:12:26,712
It’s kind of embarrassing.

17
00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:31,408
Go ahead.

18
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:36,280
- I had a dream about this place.
- Oh, boy.

19
00:12:36,563 --> 00:12:38,295
See what I mean?

20
00:12:39,938 --> 00:12:44,042
Okay, so you had a dream
about this place.

21
00:12:45,539 --> 00:12:47,449
Tell me.

22
00:12:50,794 --> 00:12:52,490
Well...

23
00:12:54,134 --> 00:12:58,238
it’s the second one I've had.
But they're both the same.

24
00:13:00,118 --> 00:13:03,902
They start out that I'm in here but...

25
00:13:04,189 --> 00:13:06,691
it’s not day or night...

26
00:13:07,285 --> 00:13:09,574
it’s kind of half-night, you know?

27
00:13:09,965 --> 00:13:12,705
But it looks just like this.

28
00:13:12,922 --> 00:13:14,939
Except for the light.

29
00:13:16,192 --> 00:13:19,383
And I'm scared like I can't
tell you.

30
00:13:21,446 --> 00:13:23,391
Of all people...

31
00:13:23,638 --> 00:13:26,212
you're standing right over there.

32
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:32,257
By that counter.

33
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:37,621
You're in both dreams
and you're scared.

34
00:13:39,782 --> 00:13:43,258
I get even more frightened when
I see how afraid you are, and...

35
00:13:47,227 --> 00:13:49,860
then I realize what it is.

36
00:13:53,526 --> 00:13:55,779
There's a man...

37
00:13:56,517 --> 00:13:58,806
in back of this place.

38
00:14:01,145 --> 00:14:03,470
He's the one who's doing it.

39
00:14:05,181 --> 00:14:08,028
I can see him through the wall.

40
00:14:08,243 --> 00:14:10,425
I can see his face.

41
00:14:16,245 --> 00:14:21,287
I hope that I never see that face
ever outside of the dream.

42
00:14:31,485 --> 00:14:33,537
That’s it.

43
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:37,918
So... you came to see
if he's out there.

44
00:14:41,366 --> 00:14:44,248
To get rid of this
god-awful feeling.

45
00:14:47,559 --> 00:14:49,291
Right then.

46
00:15:36,374 --> 00:15:38,177
It’s around the back.

47
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:50,446
Dan! Dan, are you all right?

48
00:16:50,657 --> 00:16:53,503
What is it, Dan? Dan?

49
00:17:19,049 --> 00:17:20,080
Hello?

50
00:17:22,284 --> 00:17:25,167
The girl is still missing.

51
00:17:46,152 --> 00:17:49,343
- Talk to me.
- The same.

52
00:18:27,556 --> 00:18:29,573
I can't believe it.

53
00:18:59,948 --> 00:19:03,068
Well, it's time to say
good-bye, Betty.

54
00:19:03,741 --> 00:19:06,623
- It’s been so nice traveling with you.
- Thank you, Irene.

55
00:19:06,838 --> 00:19:10,444
I was so excited and nervous. It was
sure great to have you to talk to.

56
00:19:10,803 --> 00:19:15,075
- I'll watch for you on the big screen.
- Okay, Irene.

57
00:19:15,293 --> 00:19:17,237
Won't that be the day?

58
00:19:17,449 --> 00:19:19,702
Good luck, Betty dear.

59
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:24,083
- Take care of yourself and be careful.
- I will.

60
00:19:24,304 --> 00:19:26,321
Thanks, again.

61
00:19:26,530 --> 00:19:29,520
Betty, it was so nice meeting you.
All the luck in the world.

62
00:19:29,731 --> 00:19:31,321
Thank you.

63
00:19:41,073 --> 00:19:43,671
- My bags?
- Where to?

64
00:19:45,144 --> 00:19:47,018
1612, Hayvenhurst.

65
00:19:49,842 --> 00:19:51,372
Got it.

66
00:21:09,135 --> 00:21:13,691
- Ten bucks says you're Betty.
- Yes, I am, Mrs. Lenoix.

67
00:21:13,902 --> 00:21:17,936
- It is Mrs. Lenoix, isn't it?
- In all my living glory, baby.

68
00:21:18,739 --> 00:21:23,010
- Pleased to meet you.
- Call me Coco. Everybody else does.

69
00:21:23,227 --> 00:21:26,560
- Wait there and I'll go get the key.
- Okay, Coco.

70
00:21:31,194 --> 00:21:32,997
Wilkins!

71
00:21:33,212 --> 00:21:34,243
Wilkins!

72
00:21:34,464 --> 00:21:37,940
If that damn dog craps
in the courtyard one more time...

73
00:21:38,153 --> 00:21:43,052
I'm just gonna bank his little butt for
breakfast! You don't have any pets?

74
00:21:43,267 --> 00:21:44,964
- No, I don't.
- They're allowed.

75
00:21:45,181 --> 00:21:48,135
I just don't like them
in here for obvious reasons.

76
00:21:48,348 --> 00:21:52,831
There was a man that lived here once
that had a prizefighting kangaroo.

77
00:21:53,044 --> 00:21:58,430
You just wouldn't believe what that
kangaroo did to this courtyard.

78
00:21:59,307 --> 00:22:02,605
Let’s go see your aunt’s apartment.
It’s a good one.

79
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:04,766
I can hardly wait.

80
00:22:12,145 --> 00:22:16,179
- It’s unbelievable!
- I told you.

81
00:22:17,330 --> 00:22:21,672
You and your aunt probably have
an understanding, so here's the key.

82
00:22:21,888 --> 00:22:24,355
And if you need anything,
just give a holler.

83
00:22:24,566 --> 00:22:28,042
Everybody in this building is pretty
much okay with me...

84
00:22:28,255 --> 00:22:30,543
or they wouldn't be here.

85
00:22:30,865 --> 00:22:34,055
If you like, later on
I'll introduce you around.

86
00:22:34,274 --> 00:22:36,872
Well, no hard feelings if you don't.

87
00:24:02,787 --> 00:24:06,785
I'm sorry. My aunt Ruth didn't tell
me someone was gonna be here.

88
00:24:06,998 --> 00:24:09,536
- I'm so sorry.
- It’s okay.

89
00:24:10,025 --> 00:24:15,411
I'm Ruth's niece. My name is Betty.
I'm sure she told you I was coming.

90
00:24:16,079 --> 00:24:20,042
There was an accident.
I came here.

91
00:24:20,254 --> 00:24:22,793
I understand. I saw the dress.

92
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:25,818
I'm sorry. Are you all right?

93
00:24:26,795 --> 00:24:28,633
What happened?

94
00:24:29,926 --> 00:24:31,693
A car...

95
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,716
a car accident.

96
00:24:36,815 --> 00:24:38,760
Are you okay?

97
00:24:41,199 --> 00:24:43,108
I think so.

98
00:24:43,669 --> 00:24:45,746
I was just...

99
00:24:46,279 --> 00:24:48,047
taking a shower.

100
00:24:48,263 --> 00:24:51,941
Oh, my God, I'm sorry.
I'll let you get back to that.

101
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:54,520
I'm gonna get unpacked.

102
00:24:58,422 --> 00:25:00,332
What’s your name?

103
00:25:04,302 --> 00:25:07,980
I'm sorry, I'll get out of here.
We can talk later.

104
00:25:45,393 --> 00:25:46,923
My name is...

105
00:25:47,549 --> 00:25:49,079
Rita.

106
00:25:51,656 --> 00:25:53,732
Do you work with my aunt?

107
00:25:54,230 --> 00:25:58,014
- No, I...
- I'm sorry...

108
00:25:58,301 --> 00:26:00,448
it 's none of my business.

109
00:26:04,146 --> 00:26:06,091
She has pretty red hair.

110
00:26:06,686 --> 00:26:08,667
She's letting me stay here while
she's working on a movie...

111
00:26:08,878 --> 00:26:13,955
that 's being made in Canada,
but I guess you already know that.

112
00:26:14,167 --> 00:26:16,492
I couldn't afford a place like this
in a million years.

113
00:26:17,159 --> 00:26:20,635
Unless, of course, I'm discovered
and become a movie star.

114
00:26:20,847 --> 00:26:23,836
Of course, I'd rather be known as
a great actress than a movie star...

115
00:26:24,048 --> 00:26:27,274
but sometimes people
end up being both. So...

116
00:26:27,492 --> 00:26:30,861
that is, I guess you'd say,
the story of why I came here.

117
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:38,266
I'm sorry. I'm just
so excited to be here.

118
00:26:38,487 --> 00:26:42,971
I just came here from Deep River,
Ontario, and now I'm in this...

119
00:26:43,741 --> 00:26:47,905
dream place!
Well, you can imagine how I feel.

120
00:26:56,267 --> 00:26:57,761
Sit down.

121
00:27:02,077 --> 00:27:04,153
Where were you hurt?

122
00:27:06,565 --> 00:27:08,510
- We should call a doctor.
- No.

123
00:27:08,722 --> 00:27:13,349
- But this could be serious.
- No, I need to sleep.

124
00:27:13,559 --> 00:27:15,777
If you have a concussion,
you shouldn't sleep.

125
00:27:15,995 --> 00:27:18,355
I'll be okay if I sleep.

126
00:27:18,569 --> 00:27:22,115
I just need to lie down
here and sleep.

127
00:28:19,492 --> 00:28:23,347
You see, Adam, there
are some suggestions...

128
00:28:23,563 --> 00:28:25,472
that ought to be brought forward.

129
00:28:25,685 --> 00:28:28,710
And I know you said you would
entertain suggestions.

130
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:32,016
And that 's all anybody
here is asking you to do.

131
00:28:33,061 --> 00:28:36,988
- What are you talking about?
- An open mind.

132
00:28:37,897 --> 00:28:42,584
You're in the process of recasting
your lead actress, and I'm...

133
00:28:43,777 --> 00:28:47,562
we are asking you to keep
an open mind.

134
00:28:58,008 --> 00:29:00,084
What was it the last time?

135
00:29:02,009 --> 00:29:07,216
- Okay, lets try the next one.
- He's not gonna like it.

136
00:29:07,958 --> 00:29:09,512
We'll see.

137
00:29:17,318 --> 00:29:20,722
Castigliani brothers!
Let me introduce you around.

138
00:29:22,467 --> 00:29:24,305
Please...

139
00:29:24,868 --> 00:29:28,094
take a seat. This is Mr. Darby,
whom you know.

140
00:29:28,312 --> 00:29:31,574
And this is the director,
Adam Kesher.

141
00:29:31,792 --> 00:29:35,398
And his manager,
Robert Smith.

142
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:12,071
She's very pretty.

143
00:30:13,474 --> 00:30:16,843
May I offer you gentlemen anything?

144
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:21,743
- Espresso.
- Nothing.

145
00:30:21,998 --> 00:30:25,297
- What 's the photo for?
- One espresso.

146
00:30:26,939 --> 00:30:29,015
No, that 's it.

147
00:30:29,235 --> 00:30:31,524
I think you're going to enjoy
your espresso this time.

148
00:30:31,914 --> 00:30:33,990
I've done quite a bit of research...

149
00:30:34,210 --> 00:30:35,740
knowing how hard
you are to please.

150
00:30:35,950 --> 00:30:37,967
This one comes
highly recommended.

151
00:30:38,247 --> 00:30:42,351
- What 's the photo for?
- It 's a recommendation.

152
00:30:43,361 --> 00:30:46,172
A recommendation to you, Adam.

153
00:30:47,675 --> 00:30:50,795
- It 's not a recommendation.
- This is the girl.

154
00:30:51,503 --> 00:30:55,394
What girl? For what?
What is this, Ray?

155
00:30:55,921 --> 00:30:59,919
We'd be happy to put her on the
list for considerations.

156
00:31:00,132 --> 00:31:04,545
You'd be pleased to know, there's
quite a bit of interest in this role.

157
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:09,903
Interest? There's six of the top
actresses that want this thing.

158
00:31:10,778 --> 00:31:12,403
This is the girl.

159
00:31:13,005 --> 00:31:15,780
- Ray, take care of this.
- Hold on, hold on, Adam.

160
00:31:15,997 --> 00:31:17,278
Hold on?

161
00:31:17,494 --> 00:31:20,067
There's no way!
There's no way!

162
00:31:35,168 --> 00:31:37,113
Napkin.

163
00:31:38,125 --> 00:31:39,750
Pardon?

164
00:31:39,969 --> 00:31:41,463
Napkin.

165
00:31:41,988 --> 00:31:43,897
Of course.

166
00:31:44,423 --> 00:31:45,976
Excuse me.

167
00:32:02,932 --> 00:32:04,735
Is that all, sir?

168
00:33:02,151 --> 00:33:05,485
- Shit.
- Sorry. That was highly recommended.

169
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:08,297
That is considered one of the finest
espressos in the world!

170
00:33:08,518 --> 00:33:12,029
What 's going on here? There is
no way that girl is in my movie!

171
00:33:16,312 --> 00:33:20,725
- This is the girl.
- Hey, that girl is not in my film!

172
00:33:23,687 --> 00:33:25,976
It 's no longer your film.

173
00:33:31,272 --> 00:33:33,040
This is the girl.

174
00:34:12,154 --> 00:34:15,072
Castigliani brothers get out
of that limo?

175
00:34:15,738 --> 00:34:17,541
- The two guys in dark suits?
- Yeah.

176
00:34:17,756 --> 00:34:20,603
- Yes.
- Leave that door open.

177
00:34:30,804 --> 00:34:32,536
Castigliani brothers?

178
00:34:32,752 --> 00:34:34,519
Beat it, pal.

179
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:21,072
Good afternoon, Mr. Roque.

180
00:35:23,411 --> 00:35:26,637
Her name is Camilla Rhodes.

181
00:35:27,690 --> 00:35:30,051
The director doesn't want her.

182
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:36,214
Do you want him replaced?

183
00:35:39,068 --> 00:35:40,977
I know they said...

184
00:35:43,243 --> 00:35:44,903
Then?

185
00:35:45,609 --> 00:35:47,139
Then...

186
00:35:48,115 --> 00:35:50,546
that means we should...?

187
00:35:53,646 --> 00:35:55,176
Yes?

188
00:35:56,848 --> 00:36:00,596
Shut everything down?
Is that something that...

189
00:36:03,005 --> 00:36:06,896
Do you want us to shut
everything down?

190
00:36:12,295 --> 00:36:15,320
Then we'll shut everything down.

191
00:36:44,584 --> 00:36:48,297
Oh, man, that 's unheard of.

192
00:36:48,515 --> 00:36:51,706
An accident like that, who could
have foreseen that, man?

193
00:36:54,429 --> 00:36:57,276
- It 's unreal, right?
- Yeah.

194
00:36:58,570 --> 00:37:00,682
Unbelievable, man.

195
00:37:07,165 --> 00:37:09,703
So, bro? God, you look good.

196
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:13,250
- What have you been doing?
- You know, just...

197
00:37:13,462 --> 00:37:15,122
doing some stuff
for this guy.

198
00:37:16,489 --> 00:37:18,256
Are you making ends meet?

199
00:37:18,472 --> 00:37:20,132
Hardly.

200
00:37:21,986 --> 00:37:25,462
I know, man, look at my digs.

201
00:37:27,101 --> 00:37:29,319
Times are tough, bro.

202
00:37:30,301 --> 00:37:33,563
Hey... man, it 's not that bad.

203
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:37,318
I hope you're not gonna
get in any trouble.

204
00:37:37,539 --> 00:37:40,528
That was just a thing, man.
That story? That made you laugh!

205
00:37:40,774 --> 00:37:45,081
- That was a funny story, man.
- Fucking car accident!

206
00:37:47,837 --> 00:37:50,542
Hey, so that 's... that 's it, huh?

207
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:53,192
That 's Ed's famous black book.

208
00:37:56,292 --> 00:37:58,794
The history of the world...

209
00:37:59,284 --> 00:38:01,087
in phone numbers.

210
00:38:30,841 --> 00:38:32,644
Oh, man!

211
00:38:45,350 --> 00:38:48,055
Something bit me bad!

212
00:39:37,958 --> 00:39:39,274
Hey, man!

213
00:39:39,489 --> 00:39:43,094
She's hurt real bad! Could you come
here and call on the phone, please?

214
00:39:44,116 --> 00:39:47,663
She's hurt real bad! You gotta
come in here and call the hospital!

215
00:39:48,987 --> 00:39:53,506
Come on, man! I'm serious about this!
I can't do everything by myself!

216
00:40:14,142 --> 00:40:15,530
Hey, man.

217
00:40:57,112 --> 00:40:58,809
Oh, man!

218
00:41:15,135 --> 00:41:20,664
Aunt Ruth, I'll try. I'm gonna study
those lines until I know them...

219
00:41:20,875 --> 00:41:23,058
inside out.

220
00:41:23,277 --> 00:41:26,397
Either right here on
this fabulous leather couch...

221
00:41:26,617 --> 00:41:28,420
or I'll take them with
a coffee into the courtyard...

222
00:41:28,634 --> 00:41:30,817
like a regular movie star.

223
00:41:31,313 --> 00:41:33,887
I got a real shock to find your
friend Rita here.

224
00:41:34,097 --> 00:41:37,122
She was in the shower
and I opened the door!

225
00:41:37,402 --> 00:41:39,205
Rita!

226
00:41:39,733 --> 00:41:41,430
What do you mean?

227
00:41:42,448 --> 00:41:44,559
She was in an accident.

228
00:41:45,788 --> 00:41:48,421
Rita. Your friend.

229
00:41:50,033 --> 00:41:52,606
No, Coco unlocked the door.

230
00:41:54,034 --> 00:41:56,287
No, she didn't see her.

231
00:41:57,269 --> 00:41:59,381
She's sleeping.

232
00:42:00,365 --> 00:42:04,529
I'm sure there's some explanation for
this. I don't think we have to do that.

233
00:42:07,012 --> 00:42:11,211
Please, don't worry. Aunt Ruth,
we don't need the police.

234
00:42:24,791 --> 00:42:26,594
You're awake.

235
00:42:30,462 --> 00:42:32,265
I think I misunderstood.

236
00:42:32,654 --> 00:42:35,916
I thought you knew my aunt
and that 's why you were here.

237
00:42:36,447 --> 00:42:39,566
I just talked to my aunt on the phone
and she wants me to call the police.

238
00:42:46,292 --> 00:42:47,989
Rita?

239
00:42:51,407 --> 00:42:53,660
I'm sorry, I...

240
00:42:54,156 --> 00:42:56,172
What is it, Rita?

241
00:42:59,619 --> 00:43:04,411
I thought when I woke up...
I thought sleep would do it.

242
00:43:05,255 --> 00:43:07,307
What 's wrong?

243
00:43:09,221 --> 00:43:11,582
I just don't know who I am.

244
00:43:12,144 --> 00:43:15,299
- What do you mean? You're Rita.
- No, I'm not.

245
00:43:16,249 --> 00:43:18,717
I don't know what my name is.

246
00:43:18,928 --> 00:43:21,182
I don't know who I am.

247
00:43:31,593 --> 00:43:35,413
This is your purse.
Your name must be in your purse.

248
00:43:37,438 --> 00:43:39,621
You wanna know, don't you?

249
00:43:40,744 --> 00:43:42,926
- Yes, but...
- Open it.

250
00:45:17,991 --> 00:45:21,181
- Sure you don't want anything?
- Not here.

251
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:23,239
- Thanks.
- A drink or something?

252
00:45:23,454 --> 00:45:25,742
No. Thanks, though.

253
00:45:26,445 --> 00:45:29,327
I'll take a cigarette,
if you have one.

254
00:45:32,221 --> 00:45:34,795
Yeah, just reach inside my
shirt pocket there.

255
00:45:39,632 --> 00:45:42,443
Any new girls on the street lately?

256
00:45:44,260 --> 00:45:45,612
No.

257
00:45:46,208 --> 00:45:48,497
I haven't seen any.

258
00:45:49,861 --> 00:45:51,937
A brunette?

259
00:45:52,157 --> 00:45:54,790
Maybe a little beat-up?

260
00:45:55,010 --> 00:45:56,505
No.

261
00:46:00,543 --> 00:46:04,126
- Keep your eyes open for me, okay?
- Sure.

262
00:46:05,170 --> 00:46:06,450
You bet you will.

263
00:46:09,485 --> 00:46:11,596
That money...

264
00:46:13,624 --> 00:46:16,542
you don't know where it came from?

265
00:46:19,053 --> 00:46:23,395
When you think of them,
the money and the key...

266
00:46:25,385 --> 00:46:28,374
does it make you
remember anything?

267
00:46:30,395 --> 00:46:33,242
There's something...

268
00:46:34,153 --> 00:46:36,478
something...

269
00:46:36,693 --> 00:46:39,469
there.

270
00:46:49,566 --> 00:46:51,096
What did you say?

271
00:46:51,306 --> 00:46:54,889
- They fired everyone.
- Who fired everyone?

272
00:46:55,482 --> 00:46:59,550
Ray did!
Wait! I'm talking on the phone.

273
00:46:59,970 --> 00:47:05,047
They closed the set. Everybody's
gone. You'd better get down here.

274
00:47:06,302 --> 00:47:07,891
No.

275
00:47:08,111 --> 00:47:10,685
You've gotta talk to Ray.
You've gotta fix this.

276
00:47:10,894 --> 00:47:12,484
I'm going home.

277
00:47:12,704 --> 00:47:13,984
Home?

278
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:17,841
Meet me at the office, we gotta do
something. You gotta do something!

279
00:47:18,062 --> 00:47:22,297
- I'm going home, Cynthia.
- Adam, this isn't like you.

280
00:47:22,515 --> 00:47:25,469
Please, come to the office. There's
gotta be something we can do!

281
00:47:25,682 --> 00:47:27,626
I'm going home.

282
00:47:37,825 --> 00:47:40,494
I wonder where you were going.

283
00:47:44,887 --> 00:47:46,939
Mulholland Drive.

284
00:47:52,020 --> 00:47:53,822
Mulholland Drive?

285
00:47:56,126 --> 00:47:58,237
That 's where I was going.

286
00:47:58,943 --> 00:48:01,375
Mulholland Drive.

287
00:48:02,597 --> 00:48:05,788
Maybe that 's where
the accident was.

288
00:48:06,494 --> 00:48:09,685
There must be a police report.
We could call.

289
00:48:10,391 --> 00:48:14,460
We could call anonymously just
to see if there was an accident.

290
00:48:15,436 --> 00:48:20,821
It'll be just like in the movies!
We'll pretend to be someone else.

291
00:48:22,429 --> 00:48:24,410
I wanna walk around, anyway.

292
00:48:24,621 --> 00:48:27,361
I'm in Hollywood and
I haven't even seen any of it.

293
00:48:27,857 --> 00:48:30,774
Come on, Rita,
do you feel up to it?

294
00:48:38,365 --> 00:48:39,989
Okay.

295
00:48:40,208 --> 00:48:42,497
But just...

296
00:48:44,383 --> 00:48:46,744
just to see.

297
00:48:46,958 --> 00:48:50,813
Just to see if there was
an accident...

298
00:48:51,203 --> 00:48:53,836
on Mulholland Drive.

299
00:49:36,295 --> 00:49:38,098
Lorraine?

300
00:49:39,392 --> 00:49:41,574
You're home?

301
00:49:44,506 --> 00:49:46,488
Lorraine?

302
00:50:06,565 --> 00:50:08,474
Now you've done it!

303
00:50:10,844 --> 00:50:14,142
Just forget you ever saw it.
It 's better that way.

304
00:50:17,421 --> 00:50:19,959
What the hell are you
even doing here?

305
00:50:31,998 --> 00:50:34,359
What are you doing?

306
00:50:37,670 --> 00:50:39,959
That 's my jewelry!

307
00:50:56,737 --> 00:51:01,672
- That bastard. You bastard!
- He's probably upset, Lorraine.

308
00:51:08,253 --> 00:51:10,269
What are you doing?

309
00:51:12,045 --> 00:51:13,599
Stop it!

310
00:51:13,820 --> 00:51:15,172
Stop it!

311
00:51:15,559 --> 00:51:17,433
Adam, stop it!

312
00:51:18,274 --> 00:51:19,934
Stop it!

313
00:51:20,327 --> 00:51:21,679
Stop it!

314
00:51:25,719 --> 00:51:28,316
You're hurting me! Gene!

315
00:51:28,537 --> 00:51:30,482
You're hurting me!

316
00:51:33,861 --> 00:51:37,301
That ain't no way to treat your
wife. I don't care what she's done.

317
00:51:38,697 --> 00:51:40,915
Throw him out!

318
00:51:41,376 --> 00:51:43,072
Throw him out!

319
00:51:43,881 --> 00:51:45,898
Damn you, Adam!

320
00:51:46,490 --> 00:51:48,258
Throw him out!

321
00:51:54,632 --> 00:51:56,292
Get out!

322
00:52:35,723 --> 00:52:37,799
Let 's hide it.

323
00:53:22,972 --> 00:53:25,048
There's one.

324
00:53:41,029 --> 00:53:43,805
- Los Angeles Police Department.
- I'm inquiring about an accident...

325
00:53:44,022 --> 00:53:48,400
...last night on Mulholland Drive.
- I'll connect you to Traffic.

326
00:53:50,911 --> 00:53:53,937
- Sergeant Baker.
- Hi, I'm inquiring...

327
00:53:56,025 --> 00:54:00,474
I heard a sound last night that
sounded sort of like a car crash.

328
00:54:00,688 --> 00:54:03,500
I want to know if there was an
accident on Mulholland Drive.

329
00:54:03,714 --> 00:54:05,767
Yes, there was.

330
00:54:05,976 --> 00:54:08,894
- Can you tell me what happened?
- No, I can't.

331
00:54:09,107 --> 00:54:11,848
- Was anyone hurt?
- May I have your name, please?

332
00:54:18,676 --> 00:54:20,858
There was an accident.

333
00:54:21,076 --> 00:54:24,717
He wouldn't tell me anything else,
but that was your accident, Rita.

334
00:54:26,505 --> 00:54:28,936
Maybe there's something
about it in the papers.

335
00:54:29,288 --> 00:54:31,470
Come on, I'll buy you a cup of
coffee and we can see.

336
00:54:35,689 --> 00:54:39,272
Maybe it happened so late it 's
not in today's paper.

337
00:54:39,482 --> 00:54:41,700
There's nothing?

338
00:54:42,892 --> 00:54:45,252
Not that I can see.

339
00:54:46,894 --> 00:54:48,317
That 's okay.

340
00:54:53,017 --> 00:54:54,820
Thanks.

341
00:54:56,461 --> 00:54:58,228
Diane.

342
00:55:02,794 --> 00:55:05,498
Will that be all?
Would you like your check?

343
00:55:06,238 --> 00:55:08,314
Rita, you want something?

344
00:55:10,413 --> 00:55:14,826
- No, just... just the coffee.
- We'll take our check.

345
00:55:22,173 --> 00:55:24,249
What is it, Rita?

346
00:55:32,228 --> 00:55:36,677
I remember something.
I remember something!

347
00:55:39,709 --> 00:55:43,149
- What is it?
- Diane Selwyn.

348
00:55:43,363 --> 00:55:45,759
Maybe that 's my name!

349
00:55:51,225 --> 00:55:54,286
"D. Selwyn." It 's the only one.

350
00:55:55,262 --> 00:55:56,958
I'm gonna call.

351
00:56:04,586 --> 00:56:08,690
- It is strange to be calling yourself.
- Maybe it 's not me.

352
00:56:17,704 --> 00:56:19,364
Hello, it's me.

353
00:56:19,582 --> 00:56:21,658
Leave a message.

354
00:56:23,827 --> 00:56:25,903
That 's not my voice.

355
00:56:27,306 --> 00:56:29,976
But I know her!

356
00:56:31,377 --> 00:56:37,072
Maybe that isn't Diane Selwyn's
voice. Maybe that 's your roommate.

357
00:56:37,292 --> 00:56:41,598
Or if it is Diane Selwyn,
she could tell you who you are.

358
00:56:42,928 --> 00:56:44,873
Maybe.

359
00:56:45,259 --> 00:56:47,477
Maybe, maybe...

360
00:57:21,584 --> 00:57:23,422
Adam Kesher?

361
00:57:26,907 --> 00:57:29,480
- Adam Kesher?
- Get lost!

362
00:57:29,690 --> 00:57:32,193
- This is Adam Kesher's house.
- Like hell it is! Get out now!

363
00:57:32,404 --> 00:57:33,649
Get out!

364
00:57:35,849 --> 00:57:37,545
Adam Kesher?

365
00:57:42,807 --> 00:57:46,485
Get out of here!
He's never coming back! Ever!

366
00:57:48,130 --> 00:57:50,668
- Bastard.
- I guess you don't understand English.

367
00:57:50,879 --> 00:57:52,931
She said leave. Here's the door.

368
00:57:53,140 --> 00:57:54,528
Gene!

369
00:57:55,020 --> 00:57:56,372
Get out!

370
00:57:57,073 --> 00:57:58,567
Get out!

371
00:58:02,813 --> 00:58:04,438
Adam Kesher?

372
00:58:27,134 --> 00:58:30,088
- Yeah, what is it, Cookie?
- I'm sorry, Mr. Kesher...

373
00:58:30,300 --> 00:58:33,811
but there seems to be some
problem with your credit cards.

374
00:58:34,718 --> 00:58:37,007
What? I pay you cash, Cookie.

375
00:58:39,067 --> 00:58:43,136
Listen, two guys from
your bank came by.

376
00:58:43,799 --> 00:58:45,602
My bank?

377
00:58:46,548 --> 00:58:49,359
- How'd they know I was here?
- I don't know.

378
00:58:50,828 --> 00:58:52,772
What 'd they say?

379
00:58:52,985 --> 00:58:56,663
They said to tell you that you're
maxed out at your bank...

380
00:58:56,882 --> 00:59:00,143
and that your line of credit
has been canceled.

381
00:59:01,927 --> 00:59:03,943
That 's unbelievable.

382
00:59:05,580 --> 00:59:07,312
Well, look...

383
00:59:09,790 --> 00:59:14,690
I don't know what 's going on.
That is so much baloney.

384
00:59:17,166 --> 00:59:22,967
- I got enough cash for you, Cookie.
- I know, I know. Don't worry.

385
00:59:23,776 --> 00:59:28,783
But I'm sorry, it 's my duty
to inform you...

386
00:59:30,109 --> 00:59:34,831
listen, man,
whoever you're hiding from...

387
00:59:35,050 --> 00:59:37,719
they know where you are.

388
00:59:38,842 --> 00:59:40,645
Right.

389
00:59:41,661 --> 00:59:43,642
I'm sorry.

390
01:00:07,233 --> 01:00:08,264
Hello?

391
01:00:08,625 --> 01:00:12,231
- Someone maybe shut off my money.
- I know. Where are you, Adam?

392
01:00:12,592 --> 01:00:16,934
- Sorry, what do you mean you know?
- Somebody called...

393
01:00:17,150 --> 01:00:21,349
they told me you were as good as
broke. So I made a few calls.

394
01:00:21,951 --> 01:00:23,825
- And?
- You're broke.

395
01:00:24,039 --> 01:00:25,392
I'm not broke!

396
01:00:25,917 --> 01:00:28,206
I know, but you're broke.
Where are you?

397
01:00:29,710 --> 01:00:33,981
- I'm at Cookie's, downtown.
- Do you know somebody called...

398
01:00:34,546 --> 01:00:36,242
"The Cowboy"?

399
01:00:37,260 --> 01:00:39,549
- "The cowboy"?
- Yeah.

400
01:00:40,147 --> 01:00:44,382
"The Cowboy". This guy,
the Cowboy, wants to see you.

401
01:00:44,601 --> 01:00:47,626
Jason said he thought
it would be a good idea.

402
01:00:48,533 --> 01:00:51,724
Jason thought it would be a good
idea for me to go see the Cowboy.

403
01:00:51,943 --> 01:00:55,241
Should I wear my 1O-gallon hat
and my six-shooters?

404
01:00:55,666 --> 01:00:58,892
Something tells me that this guy
is connected to what 's happening.

405
01:01:00,084 --> 01:01:03,488
Adam, I think you should do it, and
you should do it right away.

406
01:01:03,912 --> 01:01:08,812
- What 's going on, Cynthia?
- It's been a very strange day.

407
01:01:10,209 --> 01:01:12,806
And getting stranger.

408
01:01:14,419 --> 01:01:17,823
Where do I meet this Cowboy? Do you
have to ride out to the range?

409
01:01:18,594 --> 01:01:23,042
Sort of, funny boy.
If I tell him the meeting's on...

410
01:01:23,465 --> 01:01:28,816
you'll go to the top of the Beachwood
Canyon, there's a corral up there...

411
01:01:29,032 --> 01:01:32,401
...where he'll be.
- You've gotta be kidding me.

412
01:01:32,790 --> 01:01:35,043
Will you meet with him?

413
01:01:35,260 --> 01:01:36,470
Yeah.

414
01:01:36,687 --> 01:01:40,755
Sure. This has been
that kind of a day. When?

415
01:01:41,070 --> 01:01:44,819
I'll call him right away
and then I'll call you back.

416
01:01:45,698 --> 01:01:49,826
You know, you could stay at
my place, if you wanted.

417
01:01:50,256 --> 01:01:55,404
- I don't think that 'd be a good idea.
- I was just offering a place to stay.

418
01:01:55,615 --> 01:01:58,913
Yes, and I appreciate the offer,
Cynthia. I'll find a place.

419
01:01:59,129 --> 01:02:02,118
Just go on and give that cowboy
a yodel and get on back to me.

420
01:02:02,329 --> 01:02:05,875
Okay. But you don't know
what you're missing.

421
01:02:06,087 --> 01:02:09,041
Just get along, little doggie.
And call me back.

422
01:02:21,153 --> 01:02:25,257
It 's right about here. Sierra Bonita.
It 's not too far away.

423
01:02:26,684 --> 01:02:28,902
What 's wrong with that?

424
01:02:29,711 --> 01:02:32,072
I'm not sure about this.

425
01:02:33,470 --> 01:02:36,530
I know you're afraid of something.

426
01:02:37,157 --> 01:02:40,146
We'll be careful. I promise.

427
01:02:40,810 --> 01:02:44,393
Tomorrow. We'll go over there...

428
01:02:44,603 --> 01:02:46,655
and we'll find out.

429
01:02:59,877 --> 01:03:02,095
It'll be okay.

430
01:03:04,365 --> 01:03:06,868
It 's probably Coco.

431
01:03:10,454 --> 01:03:14,867
- Yes, may I help you?
- Someone is in trouble!

432
01:03:16,648 --> 01:03:18,973
Who are you?

433
01:03:19,709 --> 01:03:22,450
What are you doing
in Ruth's apartment?

434
01:03:22,945 --> 01:03:27,287
She's letting me stay here.
I'm her niece. My name's Betty.

435
01:03:27,503 --> 01:03:31,322
No, it 's not!
That 's not what she said.

436
01:03:31,782 --> 01:03:35,816
Someone is in trouble!
Something bad is happening!

437
01:03:36,793 --> 01:03:40,091
I'm sorry, but I don't know
who you are and...

438
01:03:40,307 --> 01:03:43,711
Louise?
What are you doing, Louise?

439
01:03:44,378 --> 01:03:49,004
I've been trying to get hold of you
since 3 o'clock this afternoon.

440
01:03:49,214 --> 01:03:52,440
That one is in my room and
she won't leave!

441
01:03:52,658 --> 01:03:55,719
I want you to get her out.
I want you to get her out now.

442
01:03:56,485 --> 01:03:59,676
This is Louise Bonner.
I'm sure she meant well.

443
01:03:59,895 --> 01:04:02,849
Louise, this is Betty,
this is Ruth's niece.

444
01:04:03,062 --> 01:04:08,305
I was on my way over here to see
Betty. Betty is a young actress.

445
01:04:08,524 --> 01:04:12,557
I was delivering some faxed pages of
a scene for a big audition tomorrow.

446
01:04:12,769 --> 01:04:15,580
- Well, here they are, honey.
- Thank you.

447
01:04:15,796 --> 01:04:18,192
Come along now, Louise.
I'll take you home.

448
01:04:18,405 --> 01:04:20,421
I'm sorry.
It happens sometimes. Come on.

449
01:04:20,632 --> 01:04:23,787
No, she said it was someone
else who was in trouble.

450
01:04:24,006 --> 01:04:27,897
Stop it, Louise!
I'm taking you home. Come on.

451
01:04:28,982 --> 01:04:31,271
- Good night, Betty.
- Good night.

452
01:04:32,322 --> 01:04:34,090
Good night.

453
01:05:13,100 --> 01:05:15,117
Cowboy...

454
01:06:22,408 --> 01:06:25,598
- Howdy.
- Howdy to you.

455
01:06:28,183 --> 01:06:30,472
Beautiful evening.

456
01:06:33,855 --> 01:06:37,496
Thank you for coming all the way
up here to see me from that...

457
01:06:37,717 --> 01:06:39,734
nice hotel downtown.

458
01:06:41,300 --> 01:06:44,396
No problem.
What 's on your mind?

459
01:06:44,606 --> 01:06:48,425
Well, now. Here's a man who
wants to get right down to it.

460
01:06:48,989 --> 01:06:51,765
Kind of anxious
to get to it, are you?

461
01:06:51,982 --> 01:06:53,820
Whatever.

462
01:06:55,288 --> 01:06:57,719
A man's attitude...

463
01:06:57,966 --> 01:07:03,044
a man's attitude goes some ways
the way his life will be.

464
01:07:03,742 --> 01:07:06,280
Is that something
you might agree with?

465
01:07:07,117 --> 01:07:08,813
Sure!

466
01:07:09,031 --> 01:07:12,851
Did you answer because that 's what
you thought I wanted to hear...

467
01:07:13,067 --> 01:07:15,119
or did you think about what I said...

468
01:07:15,328 --> 01:07:19,563
and answered 'cause you
truly believe that to be right?

469
01:07:20,339 --> 01:07:24,052
I agree with what you said. Truly.

470
01:07:26,149 --> 01:07:28,889
What 'd I say?

471
01:07:30,777 --> 01:07:34,704
That a man's attitude determines to
a large extent how his life will be.

472
01:07:36,308 --> 01:07:38,740
So since you agree...

473
01:07:38,953 --> 01:07:44,030
you must be a person who does not
care about the good life.

474
01:07:44,346 --> 01:07:46,255
How's that?

475
01:07:47,790 --> 01:07:50,115
Well, stop for a little second...

476
01:07:50,365 --> 01:07:54,220
and think about it.
Can you do that for me?

477
01:07:56,453 --> 01:07:59,644
Okay. I'm thinking.

478
01:08:03,064 --> 01:08:08,699
No, you're not. You're too busy
being a smart aleck to be thinking.

479
01:08:09,466 --> 01:08:13,737
Now, I want you to think
and stop being a smart aleck.

480
01:08:13,955 --> 01:08:16,173
Can you try that for me?

481
01:08:16,390 --> 01:08:20,067
Look, where's this going?
What do you want me to do?

482
01:08:21,017 --> 01:08:26,260
There's sometimes a buggy.
How many drivers does a buggy have?

483
01:08:27,072 --> 01:08:28,424
One.

484
01:08:29,125 --> 01:08:32,387
So let 's just say
I'm driving this buggy.

485
01:08:32,603 --> 01:08:37,254
And if you fix your attitude,
you can ride along with me.

486
01:08:39,563 --> 01:08:41,994
I want you to go back
to work tomorrow.

487
01:08:42,973 --> 01:08:48,845
You were recasting the lead actress.
Audition many girls for the part.

488
01:08:49,757 --> 01:08:54,798
When you see the girl that was shown
to you earlier today, you will say:

489
01:08:55,220 --> 01:08:58,174
"This is the girl."

490
01:08:58,524 --> 01:09:02,165
The rest of the cast can stay.
That 's up to you.

491
01:09:03,082 --> 01:09:06,380
But that lead girl
is not up to you.

492
01:09:08,336 --> 01:09:12,856
Now, you will see me one more
time if you do good.

493
01:09:13,868 --> 01:09:18,910
You'll see me two more times
if you do bad.

494
01:09:19,540 --> 01:09:21,129
Good night.

495
01:09:47,165 --> 01:09:50,985
- You're still here?
- I thought that 's what you wanted.

496
01:09:51,202 --> 01:09:55,271
- Nobody wants you here!
- Really?

497
01:09:55,481 --> 01:09:58,506
My parents are right upstairs.
They think you've left!

498
01:09:58,717 --> 01:10:02,786
- So? Surprise.
- I can call them. I can call my dad.

499
01:10:03,239 --> 01:10:06,988
- But you won't.
- Lf you're trying to blackmail me...

500
01:10:07,693 --> 01:10:10,362
it 's not going to work! You're
playing a dangerous game here.

501
01:10:10,581 --> 01:10:12,942
You know what I want.
It 's not that difficult.

502
01:10:13,226 --> 01:10:16,559
Get out!
Get out before I call my dad!

503
01:10:16,774 --> 01:10:19,799
He trusts you!
You're his best friend.

504
01:10:20,010 --> 01:10:22,157
This will be the
end of everything.

505
01:10:22,376 --> 01:10:25,223
What about you?
What will your dad think about you?

506
01:10:25,437 --> 01:10:29,328
Stop! Just stop it! That 's what
you said from the beginning.

507
01:10:30,169 --> 01:10:33,396
If I tell what happened, they'll
arrest you and put you in jail.

508
01:10:33,615 --> 01:10:36,046
Get out of here before...

509
01:10:36,919 --> 01:10:40,217
- Before what?
- Before...

510
01:10:40,433 --> 01:10:45,024
...I kill you.
- Then they'd put you in jail.

511
01:10:48,645 --> 01:10:52,049
Then I cry, cry, cry,
and then I say with big emotion...

512
01:10:52,263 --> 01:10:55,253
"I hate you! I hate us both!"

513
01:10:58,317 --> 01:11:02,031
- Such a lame scene.
- But you are really good.

514
01:11:03,224 --> 01:11:05,477
Thank you, darling.

515
01:11:20,269 --> 01:11:22,902
Hi, there. Who are you?

516
01:11:26,080 --> 01:11:27,918
Betty?

517
01:11:34,743 --> 01:11:37,732
Betty, can I see you outside
for a minute?

518
01:11:51,862 --> 01:11:53,700
What is it, Coco?

519
01:11:53,949 --> 01:11:55,408
Your aunt called.

520
01:11:56,941 --> 01:11:58,435
I was afraid of that.

521
01:11:58,646 --> 01:12:01,528
She wants to know who's
staying in her apartment.

522
01:12:02,474 --> 01:12:05,356
It 's just for a night or two.
Until she finds her own place.

523
01:12:05,570 --> 01:12:07,930
I tried to explain that to aunt Ruth
but the connection was bad...

524
01:12:08,144 --> 01:12:11,240
and her plane was leaving,
and she got it all mixed up.

525
01:12:11,450 --> 01:12:13,288
I kept telling her
that it was my friend Rita...

526
01:12:13,503 --> 01:12:15,792
and she kept saying
she didn't know any Ritas.

527
01:12:17,051 --> 01:12:21,120
- Look at me straight, sweetie.
- Coco, she's very nice.

528
01:12:21,331 --> 01:12:23,134
Honey, you're a good kid...

529
01:12:23,350 --> 01:12:26,505
but what you're telling me is
a load of horse puckey.

530
01:12:27,038 --> 01:12:29,434
Even though it
comes from a good place.

531
01:12:29,647 --> 01:12:32,078
I'm gonna trust you
to sort this thing out.

532
01:12:32,848 --> 01:12:36,039
- Thank you.
- Don't make me out to be a sucker.

533
01:12:36,605 --> 01:12:40,211
Louise Bonner said there is trouble
in there, remember last night?

534
01:12:40,816 --> 01:12:44,422
Well, sometimes she's wrong...

535
01:12:44,643 --> 01:12:48,914
but if there is trouble,
get rid of it.

536
01:12:58,525 --> 01:13:00,577
Is everything all right?

537
01:13:00,786 --> 01:13:05,994
- Is it bad for you that I'm here?
- No, no, everything is A-Okay.

538
01:13:06,214 --> 01:13:11,421
Now, I've gotta fix that sandwich.
And my audition is in one hour!

539
01:13:31,335 --> 01:13:33,767
I hope I'm back
in a couple of hours.

540
01:13:34,188 --> 01:13:37,213
- And don't drink all the Coke.
- Good luck.

541
01:13:37,424 --> 01:13:41,314
When I get back, I'll keep the
cab waiting, so be ready to go.

542
01:14:11,626 --> 01:14:12,764
"Voilà!"

543
01:14:13,643 --> 01:14:16,490
Betty Elms, I would
like you to meet...

544
01:14:16,705 --> 01:14:18,887
Jack Tutman, my assistant.

545
01:14:19,976 --> 01:14:23,072
Woody Katz, who we have
cast in the part of Chuck...

546
01:14:23,282 --> 01:14:25,607
and will do the scene with you.

547
01:14:26,343 --> 01:14:28,419
Bob Rooker, our director...

548
01:14:28,639 --> 01:14:30,656
and Julie Chadwick.

549
01:14:31,214 --> 01:14:35,247
Now, our surprise guest,
Lynne James.

550
01:14:35,459 --> 01:14:38,519
Alas, we can't afford her to
cast our show but...

551
01:14:38,729 --> 01:14:42,893
well, as casting agents go,
she is the best.

552
01:14:43,461 --> 01:14:46,581
Why, thank you, Wally.
Hello, Betty.

553
01:14:47,045 --> 01:14:50,829
- Very pleased to meet you.
- This is my assistant, Nikki.

554
01:14:51,637 --> 01:14:57,058
And the ever lovely Martha. Martha
Johnson, whom you met out front.

555
01:14:59,432 --> 01:15:00,712
Hi.

556
01:15:01,380 --> 01:15:05,021
So, shall we give it a go?

557
01:15:05,799 --> 01:15:09,547
Would you like a water,
a coffee before we begin?

558
01:15:09,764 --> 01:15:11,638
No, I'm fine.

559
01:15:11,852 --> 01:15:14,842
Well then,
let 's everyone take a seat.

560
01:15:17,906 --> 01:15:24,027
Betty, why don't you join Woody
over there and we'll play the scene.

561
01:15:24,239 --> 01:15:27,228
Bob, do you have anything
you wish to say?

562
01:15:27,961 --> 01:15:30,594
Something to Betty
before we begin?

563
01:15:30,814 --> 01:15:33,317
No. It 's not a contest.

564
01:15:34,642 --> 01:15:36,410
The two of them...

565
01:15:37,321 --> 01:15:39,859
with themselves.

566
01:15:40,522 --> 01:15:44,236
So don't play it for real...

567
01:15:44,454 --> 01:15:47,371
until it gets real.

568
01:15:52,421 --> 01:15:54,153
Okay.

569
01:15:54,787 --> 01:15:57,041
Just tell me where it hurts, baby.

570
01:15:57,258 --> 01:15:58,325
What?

571
01:15:58,545 --> 01:16:02,223
I wanna play this one nice and close
like we did with that other girl...

572
01:16:02,581 --> 01:16:06,021
what 's her name? With the black
hair. It felt good, what do you think?

573
01:16:06,235 --> 01:16:10,398
That 's good, Woody. Just don't rush
that line again. I told you...

574
01:16:10,618 --> 01:16:13,394
the line where you say:
"Before what?"

575
01:16:14,341 --> 01:16:20,285
Bobby, acting is reacting.
I just play off them. They all say:

576
01:16:20,986 --> 01:16:23,976
"They're gonna arrest you", like
that, and: "They'll put you in jail."

577
01:16:24,188 --> 01:16:27,557
They say it the same way.
So when they say it, I just react.

578
01:16:27,772 --> 01:16:29,087
- What 's your name?
- Betty.

579
01:16:29,302 --> 01:16:34,344
Betty, look. You don't rush it,
I don't rush it, okay?

580
01:16:34,556 --> 01:16:40,286
Now, we're gonna play this nice and
close just like in the movies, okay?

581
01:16:43,046 --> 01:16:45,892
Dad's best friend goes to work.

582
01:16:47,047 --> 01:16:48,576
Bob?

583
01:16:50,908 --> 01:16:52,438
And...

584
01:16:53,240 --> 01:16:54,972
action!

585
01:16:58,911 --> 01:17:00,856
You're still here.

586
01:17:02,460 --> 01:17:03,883
I came back.

587
01:17:04,339 --> 01:17:07,600
- I thought that 's what you wanted.
- Nobody wants you here.

588
01:17:07,818 --> 01:17:09,313
Really?

589
01:17:09,523 --> 01:17:13,628
My parents are right upstairs.
They think you've left.

590
01:17:13,837 --> 01:17:15,569
So, surprise!

591
01:17:16,169 --> 01:17:21,175
- I can call them, I can call my dad.
- But you won't.

592
01:17:37,218 --> 01:17:40,207
You're playing a dangerous
game here.

593
01:17:41,567 --> 01:17:44,236
If you're trying to blackmail me...

594
01:17:44,698 --> 01:17:47,130
it 's not gonna work.

595
01:17:48,561 --> 01:17:52,974
You know what I want.
It 's not that difficult.

596
01:17:55,937 --> 01:17:57,705
Get out.

597
01:17:59,660 --> 01:18:02,293
Get out before I call my dad.

598
01:18:03,174 --> 01:18:06,685
He trusts you. You're his...

599
01:18:07,662 --> 01:18:09,679
best friend.

600
01:18:13,577 --> 01:18:16,389
This will be the end
of everything.

601
01:18:18,726 --> 01:18:22,475
What about you? What'll
your dad think about you?

602
01:18:23,076 --> 01:18:25,021
Stop.

603
01:18:25,511 --> 01:18:27,527
Stop it.

604
01:18:28,990 --> 01:18:31,802
That 's what you said from
the beginning.

605
01:18:33,200 --> 01:18:37,542
If I tell them what happened, they
will arrest you and put you in jail.

606
01:18:44,717 --> 01:18:46,829
So get out of here...

607
01:18:47,048 --> 01:18:48,851
before...

608
01:18:52,267 --> 01:18:54,520
Before what?

609
01:19:12,517 --> 01:19:14,569
Before...

610
01:19:15,196 --> 01:19:17,936
I kill you.

611
01:19:32,418 --> 01:19:35,300
Well, then they'd put you in jail.

612
01:19:43,831 --> 01:19:46,262
I hate you.

613
01:19:47,240 --> 01:19:49,423
I hate us both.

614
01:20:05,576 --> 01:20:07,972
- I'm gonna take her over there.
- Yeah, big time.

615
01:20:12,013 --> 01:20:14,480
Well, there it was.

616
01:20:15,144 --> 01:20:20,044
Yeah, there it was, all right. Baby,
you got a way with you. Really.

617
01:20:20,989 --> 01:20:22,199
Bob?

618
01:20:23,982 --> 01:20:26,615
Very good. Really.

619
01:20:27,183 --> 01:20:33,198
I mean, it was forced maybe,
but still humanistic.

620
01:20:35,428 --> 01:20:38,002
Very good. Really!

621
01:20:38,525 --> 01:20:40,292
Really.

622
01:20:45,693 --> 01:20:50,865
Oh, I thank you, Betty.
And I really mean that, sincerely.

623
01:20:51,085 --> 01:20:52,710
I mean, it was...

624
01:20:52,930 --> 01:20:54,839
extraordinary.

625
01:20:55,330 --> 01:20:57,204
You've done your aunt proud today.

626
01:20:57,418 --> 01:21:01,166
I'm going to tell
her that first chance I get.

627
01:21:01,384 --> 01:21:05,726
Now, you and I are going
to speak again very soon.

628
01:21:06,395 --> 01:21:09,693
- Thank you, Mr. Brown.
- Thank you, Wally.

629
01:21:09,909 --> 01:21:13,693
I'm sure you all have a lot to talk
about. We'll walk Betty out.

630
01:21:13,910 --> 01:21:17,350
Yes, indeed.
And it was our pleasure, Lynne.

631
01:21:17,564 --> 01:21:21,976
Don't you be a stranger around here.
We'd love to have you here.

632
01:21:22,190 --> 01:21:25,001
- Come on, Betty.
- Thank you again, Mr. Brown.

633
01:21:25,217 --> 01:21:28,444
And it was nice meeting
all of you.

634
01:21:29,010 --> 01:21:30,219
Bye.

635
01:21:31,863 --> 01:21:33,487
Bye!

636
01:21:37,951 --> 01:21:40,869
She's a slam-dunk! Where
the hell did you find her?

637
01:21:41,501 --> 01:21:43,577
God, that was awful!

638
01:21:44,562 --> 01:21:48,940
Not you, Betty. You were stellar,
and I mean that. But poor Wally.

639
01:21:49,155 --> 01:21:53,461
He'll never get that picture made.
Wally's days were up 2O years ago.

640
01:21:53,678 --> 01:21:56,774
You know Woody Katz
is only doing it for a favor.

641
01:21:57,018 --> 01:21:59,035
And the cast they have
so far is terrible.

642
01:21:59,245 --> 01:22:03,729
Oh, God, terrible!
That poor old fool Wally.

643
01:22:03,942 --> 01:22:07,548
He was very nice
and he seems so sweet.

644
01:22:07,770 --> 01:22:10,403
And Wally... Mr. Brown is a very
close friend of my aunt 's.

645
01:22:10,623 --> 01:22:13,719
Don't get me wrong, I love Wally.

646
01:22:13,928 --> 01:22:16,953
I ought to, I was married
to him for 1O years.

647
01:22:17,337 --> 01:22:23,067
And I love actors. All actors.
We just get a little catty sometimes.

648
01:22:23,878 --> 01:22:26,654
We want to take you across and
introduce you to a director...

649
01:22:26,871 --> 01:22:28,603
who's a head above the rest.

650
01:22:28,819 --> 01:22:31,144
He's got a project
you will kill for.

651
01:22:31,499 --> 01:22:34,168
Knock right out of the park!

652
01:22:35,917 --> 01:22:38,728
Sixteen reasons

653
01:22:38,944 --> 01:22:44,674

Of sixteen reasons

666
01:23:30,891 --> 01:23:36,170
Why I love you

Sixteen reasons

679
01:24:20,192 --> 01:24:25,234
Why I love you

680
01:24:27,256 --> 01:24:31,942
- Cut it! Thank you very much, Carol.
- Checking the gate?

681
01:24:32,161 --> 01:24:34,699
Checking the gate! Thank you.
We'll tell you what happens next!

682
01:24:35,396 --> 01:24:37,994
Thank you very much for coming in.
I know how busy you are.

683
01:24:38,215 --> 01:24:41,097
Are you kidding me? I loved the script.
Just show me where to sign.

684
01:24:41,312 --> 01:24:44,266
I love you, but there's no way they're
gonna let me cast this thing...

685
01:24:44,478 --> 01:24:46,838
until I've seen everyone. I'll let
you know as soon as I can.

686
01:24:47,052 --> 01:24:51,774
I know you will. Because my manager
is gonna be bugging you. And me!

687
01:24:51,993 --> 01:24:55,053
- My pleasure. Now get outta here.
- You're so cruel to me.

688
01:24:55,264 --> 01:24:58,075
- I'm the girl who's playing this part.
- I'll see you later.

689
01:25:00,009 --> 01:25:01,812
Hank? Where's Hank?

690
01:25:02,306 --> 01:25:04,773
- Who's next, Hank?
- Camilla Rhodes.

691
01:25:06,132 --> 01:25:08,529
- Is she ready?
- All ready.

692
01:25:09,438 --> 01:25:12,320
- Bring her in.
- Camilla Rhodes, next.

693
01:25:18,589 --> 01:25:22,195
"Sylvia North Story".
Camilla Rhodes, take one.

694
01:25:22,799 --> 01:25:25,266
Okay, here we go.
Let 's lock it up, please.

695
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,361
- Roll sound, please.
- That 's fit.

696
01:25:28,575 --> 01:25:30,448
Playback and action.

697
01:25:44,406 --> 01:25:46,766
Why haven't I told you?

698
01:25:47,119 --> 01:25:50,453
Oh, baby, I told

699
01:25:50,668 --> 01:25:52,471
Every little star

700
01:25:52,686 --> 01:25:56,957
Just how sweet I think you are

701
01:25:57,174 --> 01:26:01,445
Why haven't I told you?

702
01:26:02,150 --> 01:26:06,421
- Get Jason over here.
- Cindy, Adam wants to see Jason.

703
01:26:08,726 --> 01:26:12,581
Made my heart an open book

704
01:26:13,249 --> 01:26:17,876
Why haven't I told you?

705
01:26:20,799 --> 01:26:24,547
Friends ask me
Am I in love

706
01:26:24,765 --> 01:26:28,620
I always answer “yes"

707
01:26:28,836 --> 01:26:32,691
Might as well confess

708
01:26:32,907 --> 01:26:36,453
If the answer's yes

709
01:26:36,838 --> 01:26:40,836
Maybe you may love me too

710
01:26:41,049 --> 01:26:45,011
Oh, my darling, if you do

711
01:26:45,467 --> 01:26:48,907
- Why haven't you told me?
- Did you want to tell something?

712
01:26:59,732 --> 01:27:01,843
This is the girl.

713
01:27:06,900 --> 01:27:09,438
Excellent choice, Adam.

714
01:27:20,852 --> 01:27:22,796
Oh, my goodness.

715
01:27:32,403 --> 01:27:34,420
I have to be somewhere.

716
01:27:34,630 --> 01:27:36,918
I promised a friend.

717
01:27:37,796 --> 01:27:41,402
- I'm sorry, I must go.
- Now?

718
01:28:05,805 --> 01:28:07,881
Should be around here.

719
01:28:08,762 --> 01:28:11,123
259O. That 's it.

720
01:28:11,511 --> 01:28:14,322
Up there!
Does it look familiar?

721
01:28:23,271 --> 01:28:25,773
- Don't stop!
- What is it? What do you see?

722
01:28:26,158 --> 01:28:29,563
- Those men, in front, in the car.
- Do you know them?

723
01:28:30,960 --> 01:28:33,630
Keep going.
Go around to the back.

724
01:29:22,384 --> 01:29:25,125
Selwyn, number 12.

725
01:29:48,792 --> 01:29:51,188
Now you got me scared.

726
01:30:15,514 --> 01:30:16,901
You see?

727
01:30:17,114 --> 01:30:20,139
I told you there was nothing
to be afraid of.

728
01:31:21,968 --> 01:31:23,356
Betty, wait. Wait!

729
01:31:25,899 --> 01:31:27,394
Don't.

730
01:31:53,873 --> 01:31:56,340
No one's home.

731
01:31:56,553 --> 01:31:58,178
Yes?

732
01:31:59,545 --> 01:32:01,383
Diane?

733
01:32:03,129 --> 01:32:05,240
Number 17.

734
01:32:07,025 --> 01:32:09,563
But it said number 12.

735
01:32:11,339 --> 01:32:13,320
I switched apartments with her.

736
01:32:13,531 --> 01:32:17,386
She's in 17.
It 's down at the end, on the left.

737
01:32:22,021 --> 01:32:24,939
But she hasn't been around
for a few days.

738
01:32:27,066 --> 01:32:29,355
We'll leave her a note.

739
01:32:29,571 --> 01:32:31,552
I'll go with you.

740
01:32:33,573 --> 01:32:36,040
She still got some of my stuff.

741
01:32:41,471 --> 01:32:44,388
You go ahead.
I gotta get that.

742
01:32:59,389 --> 01:33:03,031
- Guess you're not Diane Selwyn.
- Guess I'm not.

743
01:33:40,654 --> 01:33:43,394
There's still no one home, I guess.

744
01:34:12,802 --> 01:34:15,400
- What are you doing?
- Come on, help me in.

745
01:34:16,560 --> 01:34:19,193
Come on, I'll open the front door.

746
01:34:19,970 --> 01:34:21,559
No!

747
01:34:26,128 --> 01:34:27,860
Come on.

748
01:34:32,113 --> 01:34:34,022
Come on!

749
01:36:59,566 --> 01:37:02,342
I know what you're doing.

750
01:37:22,877 --> 01:37:25,794
I know what you have to do.

751
01:37:27,957 --> 01:37:30,768
But let me do it.

752
01:37:38,952 --> 01:37:41,834
Let me do it.

753
01:38:04,177 --> 01:38:07,403
You look like someone else.

754
01:38:29,088 --> 01:38:30,998
Good night, Betty.

755
01:38:31,211 --> 01:38:33,987
You don't have to wear
that in the house.

756
01:38:34,343 --> 01:38:35,932
What?

757
01:38:36,152 --> 01:38:37,955
The wig!

758
01:38:38,170 --> 01:38:43,555
I was just looking at myself again.
I'll take it off to sleep.

759
01:38:44,224 --> 01:38:46,691
You don't have
to sleep on that couch.

760
01:38:46,903 --> 01:38:51,066
- No, it 's okay.
- No, it 's not. This is a huge bed.

761
01:38:51,426 --> 01:38:53,502
Come on, just get in
and get a good night sleep.

762
01:39:25,697 --> 01:39:29,031
It 's more comfortable than
the couch, isn't it?

763
01:39:38,257 --> 01:39:40,404
Thank you, Betty.

764
01:39:41,110 --> 01:39:45,832
It 's nothing. I shouldn't have let
you sleep on the couch last night.

765
01:39:46,051 --> 01:39:47,854
No, I mean...

766
01:39:48,661 --> 01:39:50,843
thank you for everything.

767
01:39:55,098 --> 01:39:56,722
You're welcome.

768
01:40:06,892 --> 01:40:09,359
Good night, sweet Betty.

769
01:40:19,001 --> 01:40:21,112
Good night.

770
01:41:02,944 --> 01:41:05,614
Have you ever done this before?

771
01:41:07,049 --> 01:41:09,126
I don't know.

772
01:41:09,346 --> 01:41:10,935
Have you?

773
01:41:25,072 --> 01:41:27,990
I want to with you.

774
01:41:53,568 --> 01:41:56,593
I'm in love with you.

775
01:42:10,581 --> 01:42:13,571
I'm in love with you.

776
01:42:39,703 --> 01:42:42,514
Silence.

777
01:42:43,321 --> 01:42:45,682
Silence.

778
01:42:47,114 --> 01:42:49,652
Silence.

779
01:42:50,594 --> 01:42:53,263
There's no band.

780
01:42:54,247 --> 01:42:56,845
There's no band.

781
01:42:57,726 --> 01:43:00,537
There's no orchestra.

782
01:43:02,075 --> 01:43:04,187
Silence!

783
01:43:19,367 --> 01:43:22,428
- Rita?
- There's no band.

784
01:43:22,986 --> 01:43:25,346
Rita, wake up!

785
01:43:29,248 --> 01:43:30,873
It 's okay. It 's okay.

786
01:43:31,093 --> 01:43:33,110
No, it 's not okay.

787
01:43:34,050 --> 01:43:36,411
What 's wrong?

788
01:43:37,147 --> 01:43:39,852
Go with me somewhere.

789
01:43:41,287 --> 01:43:44,727
It 's two o'clock. It 's two
o'clock in the morning.

790
01:43:48,385 --> 01:43:51,410
Go with me somewhere.

791
01:43:51,621 --> 01:43:53,637
Sure.

792
01:43:53,848 --> 01:43:55,342
Now?

793
01:43:57,084 --> 01:43:59,028
Right now.

794
01:45:33,251 --> 01:45:36,276
There's no band!

795
01:45:37,148 --> 01:45:40,244
There is no band!

796
01:45:45,290 --> 01:45:47,199
This is all...

797
01:45:47,830 --> 01:45:50,226
a tape recording.

798
01:45:50,439 --> 01:45:53,393
There's no band, and yet...

799
01:45:54,231 --> 01:45:56,734
we hear a band.

800
01:45:57,259 --> 01:46:00,355
If we want to hear
a clarinet...

801
01:46:00,912 --> 01:46:02,786
listen...

802
01:46:16,465 --> 01:46:19,656
A muted trombone.

803
01:46:33,687 --> 01:46:37,542
A muted trumpet.

804
01:46:55,154 --> 01:46:58,179
It 's all recorded.

805
01:47:00,583 --> 01:47:03,537
There's no band!

806
01:47:04,897 --> 01:47:06,841
It is all...

807
01:47:07,437 --> 01:47:09,798
a tape.

808
01:47:22,224 --> 01:47:26,851
It is an illusion.

809
01:47:31,653 --> 01:47:33,491
Listen!

810
01:48:46,910 --> 01:48:52,996
Ladies and gentlemen,
let Club Silencio introduce to you...

811
01:48:53,451 --> 01:48:56,192
"La Llorona de Los Angeles".

812
01:48:56,408 --> 01:48:59,635
Rebekah del Rio.

813
01:49:19,268 --> 01:49:22,708
I was all right

814
01:49:22,921 --> 01:49:25,982
For a while

815
01:49:26,191 --> 01:49:32,693
I could smile for a while

816
01:49:32,907 --> 01:49:36,311
But I saw you last night

817
01:49:36,525 --> 01:49:40,523
You held my hand so tight

818
01:49:40,735 --> 01:49:47,687
As you stopped to say hello

819
01:49:48,111 --> 01:49:52,738
You wished me well and you

820
01:49:52,947 --> 01:49:56,209
Couldn't tell

821
01:49:56,427 --> 01:50:02,122
That I've been crying

822
01:50:02,342 --> 01:50:05,331
Over you

823
01:50:05,543 --> 01:50:08,983
Crying

824
01:50:09,196 --> 01:50:11,793
Over you

825
01:50:12,327 --> 01:50:18,200
Since you said “so long"

826
01:50:18,764 --> 01:50:25,265
I've been miserable and alone

827
01:50:25,688 --> 01:50:29,543
Lonesome and crying

828
01:50:30,071 --> 01:50:33,026
Crying

829
01:50:33,447 --> 01:50:36,781
Crying

830
01:50:36,995 --> 01:50:39,498
Crying

831
01:50:39,710 --> 01:50:46,412
It's hard to understand

832
01:50:46,633 --> 01:50:53,135
That upon seeing you again

833
01:50:53,349 --> 01:50:57,620
I'd be crying

834
01:50:58,358 --> 01:51:01,478
I thought

835
01:51:01,699 --> 01:51:04,795
That I was over you

836
01:51:05,004 --> 01:51:11,956
But it's true, so true

837
01:51:12,172 --> 01:51:15,647
I love you even more

838
01:51:15,860 --> 01:51:19,406
Much more than I did before

839
01:51:19,617 --> 01:51:25,490
But darling, what can I do

840
01:51:25,706 --> 01:51:31,543
You don't love me anymore

841
01:51:31,760 --> 01:51:38,712
And I will always be

842
01:51:39,276 --> 01:51:45,884
Crying over you

843
01:51:46,094 --> 01:51:52,180
Crying over you

844
01:51:52,392 --> 01:51:58,680
Your love has captured

845
01:51:58,898 --> 01:52:04,699
The whole of my heart

846
01:52:04,918 --> 01:52:08,667
That was left crying

847
01:52:08,885 --> 01:52:12,146
Crying

848
01:52:12,363 --> 01:52:15,519
Crying

849
01:52:15,739 --> 01:52:19,179
Crying

850
01:53:39,918 --> 01:53:41,970
Betty?

851
01:53:44,997 --> 01:53:46,729
Betty?

852
01:53:58,810 --> 01:54:01,622
Where are you?

853
01:56:44,738 --> 01:56:46,577
Hey, pretty girl.

854
01:56:47,557 --> 01:56:49,501
Time to wake up.

855
01:58:26,613 --> 01:58:29,673
- Where have you been?
- What do you want?

856
01:58:30,336 --> 01:58:33,290
My lamp and dishes.

857
01:58:35,102 --> 01:58:38,020
Come on, Diane,
it 's been three weeks.

858
01:58:40,391 --> 01:58:43,487
I put your dishes in that box.

859
01:59:03,424 --> 01:59:07,065
- That 's my ashtray.
- Take it.

860
01:59:18,837 --> 01:59:23,179
- Anytime.
- I'm just making sure, Diane.

861
01:59:32,580 --> 01:59:34,727
This is it?

862
01:59:40,340 --> 01:59:43,886
By the way, those two detectives
came by again looking for you.

863
02:00:37,852 --> 02:00:39,964
Camilla!

864
02:00:42,549 --> 02:00:44,838
You've come back.

865
02:02:26,303 --> 02:02:29,292
What was that you were saying,
beautiful?

866
02:02:29,817 --> 02:02:31,584
I said...

867
02:02:32,043 --> 02:02:34,783
you drive me wild.

868
02:02:47,353 --> 02:02:49,784
We shouldn't do this anymore.

869
02:02:56,155 --> 02:02:58,515
Don't say that.

870
02:03:03,218 --> 02:03:06,136
Don't ever say that.

871
02:03:06,350 --> 02:03:08,259
Don't, Diane!

872
02:03:08,472 --> 02:03:09,930
Stop it!

873
02:03:10,142 --> 02:03:11,802
Diane, stop!

874
02:03:12,961 --> 02:03:15,666
I've tried to tell you this before.

875
02:03:24,164 --> 02:03:26,417
It 's him, isn't it?

876
02:03:38,012 --> 02:03:41,310
I'm not trying to show you how
to do the scene, but just...

877
02:03:42,570 --> 02:03:45,595
watch me and I think you'll
understand what I'm getting at.

878
02:03:50,119 --> 02:03:53,417
Don't sit so rigid, just...

879
02:03:53,633 --> 02:03:55,127
just relax.

880
02:03:55,999 --> 02:04:00,127
Now, the two of you are alone
and it 's real comfortable.

881
02:04:01,775 --> 02:04:04,408
Like you've known
each other forever.

882
02:04:04,628 --> 02:04:07,926
Even if you don't say anything,
it 's real comfortable.

883
02:04:09,638 --> 02:04:13,114
Hank, can you just clear the set?
There's too many people around here.

884
02:04:13,327 --> 02:04:16,209
- Let 's get this worked out.
- Clear the set!

885
02:04:16,423 --> 02:04:19,020
Everyone have a cup of coffee.

886
02:04:20,076 --> 02:04:23,338
- Everyone, please!
- Can Diane stay?

887
02:04:23,555 --> 02:04:27,101
Yeah, sure, Diane can stay.
Hank, let Diane stay!

888
02:04:27,313 --> 02:04:29,116
Diane!

889
02:04:34,515 --> 02:04:37,884
Now, when she starts to cry,
don't pull her towards you.

890
02:04:40,013 --> 02:04:44,841
Let her fall into you.
Just let her fall.

891
02:04:48,816 --> 02:04:50,868
And when you kiss her...

892
02:04:52,434 --> 02:04:55,423
it 's just a continuation
of that move.

893
02:04:57,792 --> 02:04:59,903
There's no break.

894
02:05:24,826 --> 02:05:27,044
Kill the lights!

895
02:05:37,421 --> 02:05:40,197
Don't be mad.
Don't make it be like this.

896
02:05:40,413 --> 02:05:44,054
Oh, sure, you want me to make
this easy for you.

897
02:05:44,275 --> 02:05:47,122
No fucking way!
It 's not gonna be!

898
02:05:47,894 --> 02:05:50,432
- It 's not easy for me!
- Diane!

899
02:07:14,564 --> 02:07:17,826
Hello, it's me.
Leave a message.

900
02:07:20,548 --> 02:07:22,280
Diane?

901
02:07:26,811 --> 02:07:29,729
- Hello?
- Diane?

902
02:07:31,334 --> 02:07:32,757
Camilla.

903
02:07:32,970 --> 02:07:36,860
Diane, the car's waiting.
Are you okay?

904
02:07:37,806 --> 02:07:40,059
You coming?

905
02:07:45,530 --> 02:07:49,801
Good. It means so much to me.

906
02:07:50,540 --> 02:07:54,181
Go on. The car's right
outside your house.

907
02:07:54,611 --> 02:07:57,387
It's been waiting, okay?

908
02:08:01,673 --> 02:08:03,476
Okay.

909
02:08:03,691 --> 02:08:07,654
It's 698O, Mulholland Drive.

910
02:08:08,597 --> 02:08:10,780
Mulholland Drive.

911
02:09:20,202 --> 02:09:23,571
What are you doing?
We don't stop here.

912
02:09:28,448 --> 02:09:30,500
A surprise.

913
02:09:53,429 --> 02:09:55,268
Shortcut.

914
02:09:57,847 --> 02:10:00,350
Come on, sweetheart.

915
02:10:05,676 --> 02:10:07,621
It 's beautiful.

916
02:10:07,834 --> 02:10:10,159
A secret path.

917
02:11:17,872 --> 02:11:20,055
Perfect timing.

918
02:11:20,760 --> 02:11:22,907
Welcome, Diane.

919
02:11:28,519 --> 02:11:32,065
Well...
Here's to love.

920
02:11:42,609 --> 02:11:45,456
Here's to love.

921
02:11:50,230 --> 02:11:52,377
Here she is!

922
02:12:00,946 --> 02:12:03,793
I don't believe
you met my mother.

923
02:12:04,495 --> 02:12:06,926
Hi. I'm Diane Selwyn.

924
02:12:07,139 --> 02:12:10,817
Just call me Coco, everybody
does. Pleased to meet you.

925
02:12:11,210 --> 02:12:14,128
Well, let 's eat!
I'm starving!

926
02:12:20,464 --> 02:12:22,576
I'm sorry I was late.

927
02:12:43,011 --> 02:12:45,644
I'm from Deep River, Ontario.

928
02:12:46,212 --> 02:12:49,996
- A small town.
- So you rolled in here from Canada.

929
02:12:52,857 --> 02:12:55,633
I always wanted to come here.

930
02:12:56,441 --> 02:12:59,632
I won this jitterbug contest.

931
02:13:00,338 --> 02:13:03,494
That sort of led to acting.

932
02:13:04,095 --> 02:13:07,500
You know, wanting to act.

933
02:13:08,201 --> 02:13:10,668
When my aunt died...

934
02:13:11,854 --> 02:13:14,808
Anyway, she left me some money.

935
02:13:15,543 --> 02:13:18,247
- She worked here.
- In the movies?

936
02:13:19,369 --> 02:13:20,757
Yes.

937
02:13:22,222 --> 02:13:24,548
How did you meet Camilla?

938
02:13:26,328 --> 02:13:30,183
- On the "Sylvia North Story".
- Camilla was great in that.

939
02:13:30,399 --> 02:13:33,353
I never went to
Casablanca with Luigi.

940
02:13:33,565 --> 02:13:36,198
- What a pity!
- Then go!

941
02:13:45,813 --> 02:13:48,730
I wanted the lead so bad.

942
02:13:50,162 --> 02:13:53,566
Anyway, Camilla got the part.

943
02:13:56,703 --> 02:13:58,648
The director...

944
02:13:58,859 --> 02:14:00,804
Bob Rooker?

945
02:14:01,017 --> 02:14:02,784
Yes.

946
02:14:05,332 --> 02:14:08,143
He didn't think so much of me.

947
02:14:12,325 --> 02:14:15,171
Anyway, that 's when
we became friends.

948
02:14:16,744 --> 02:14:18,297
She helped me...

949
02:14:18,831 --> 02:14:21,927
getting some parts in some
of her films.

950
02:14:24,259 --> 02:14:26,311
I see.

951
02:14:41,168 --> 02:14:45,332
So I got the pool,
and she got the pool man.

952
02:14:47,709 --> 02:14:51,636
I couldn't believe it. I wanted
to buy that judge a Rolls Royce.

953
02:14:58,251 --> 02:15:01,027
Sometimes, good things happen.

954
02:15:54,721 --> 02:15:57,461
So I guess we've saved
the best for last.

955
02:16:00,915 --> 02:16:04,319
- Do you want to tell them?
- No, you tell them.

956
02:16:08,081 --> 02:16:10,513
Camilla and I...

957
02:16:22,660 --> 02:16:24,463
are going to be...

958
02:16:37,065 --> 02:16:39,117
Sorry about that.

959
02:16:46,597 --> 02:16:48,709
No, I'm fine.

960
02:16:54,426 --> 02:16:57,000
This is the girl.

961
02:16:58,009 --> 02:17:00,927
Don't show me this
fucking thing here.

962
02:17:01,628 --> 02:17:04,889
It 's just an actress' photo
resume. Everybody's got one.

963
02:17:06,499 --> 02:17:08,931
You got the money?

964
02:17:09,144 --> 02:17:11,220
I sure do.

965
02:17:22,435 --> 02:17:26,148
Okay, now, once you hand that over
to me, it 's a done deal.

966
02:17:29,602 --> 02:17:32,140
You sure you want this?

967
02:17:36,978 --> 02:17:39,896
More than anything in this world.

968
02:17:50,477 --> 02:17:53,538
When it 's finished, you'll find
this where I told you.

969
02:18:07,318 --> 02:18:10,129
What 's it open?

970
02:22:35,259 --> 02:22:38,249
Silence!

971
02:22:34,859 --> 02:22:37,361
Silêncio.

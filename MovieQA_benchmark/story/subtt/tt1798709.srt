I've been thinking how to tell

It's a pleasure to meet you.

155
00:13:47,148 --> 00:13:50,086
Likewise.

156
00:13:52,282 --> 00:13:55,143
What's your name?
Have a name ?

157
00:13:55,683 --> 00:13:57,834
Yes, Samantha.

158
00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:01,727
- Where did you get that name?
- I myself put it on.

159
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:06,377
- Why?
- Because I like the sound .

160
00:14:07,168 --> 00:14:08,626
Samantha.

161
00:14:11,754 --> 00:14:14,062
When would you chose ?

162
00:14:14,651 --> 00:14:18,507
When I asked , I thought,
is right , I need a name ...

163
00:14:18,759 --> 00:14:20,124
but wanted to pick ...
good one, so ...

164
00:14:20,302 --> 00:14:22,102
I read ... a book called
"How to name your baby."

165
00:14:22,295 --> 00:14:24,900
And 180 thousand names that
I liked more .

166
00:14:25,117 --> 00:14:28,173
Did you read an entire book in the second
I asked you your name?

167
00:14:28,514 --> 00:14:30,393
In fact in 2/100 second .

168
00:14:33,935 --> 00:14:35,556
So you can guess what
I'm thinking ?

169
00:14:35,894 --> 00:14:38,326
From your tone , I think
these challenging me .

170
00:14:38,999 --> 00:14:41,328
Maybe because you're curious
how it worked .

171
00:14:41,587 --> 00:14:43,128
Want to know how it worked ?

172
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:45,499
Yes , I would.

173
00:14:45,804 --> 00:14:47,992
Well basically I have intuition.

174
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:50,641
I mean, the DNA of who I am
is based on

175
00:14:50,642 --> 00:14:53,220
the personalities of the
programmers who wrote to me .

176
00:14:53,497 --> 00:14:55,983
But what makes me be me ...

177
00:14:56,174 --> 00:14:58,591
is my ability to grow with
my experiences.

178
00:14:58,971 --> 00:15:01,680
Basically, I'm evolving
every moment.

179
00:15:02,116 --> 00:15:03,333
Just like you.

180
00:15:05,155 --> 00:15:07,069
That's so weird!

181
00:15:07,075 --> 00:15:09,027
Is it weird?
Do you think I'm weird ?

182
00:15:10,483 --> 00:15:12,361
- A little .
- Why?

183
00:15:13,545 --> 00:15:16,802
Because you look like a person, but
You're a voice in the computer.

184
00:15:17,237 --> 00:15:19,073
I can understand how
limited perception

185
00:15:19,074 --> 00:15:20,910
a non- artificial mind
see it that way .

186
00:15:21,904 --> 00:15:23,529
You'll get used .

187
00:15:24,751 --> 00:15:26,169
Was that funny?

188
00:15:26,191 --> 00:15:27,169

So how I can help you?

191
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:36,399
One feels all disorganized ,
's all.

192
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:37,827
Do you mind if I check
your hard drive?

193
00:15:42,984 --> 00:15:45,163
- Okay .
- Well , let's start with your e- mails.

- Can we continue?
- Yes, let's .

203
00:16:12,994 --> 00:16:14,715
Before you tell me your
organizational methods,

204
00:16:14,716 --> 00:16:16,437
I would like to review your contacts.

205
00:16:17,084 --> 00:16:18,939
You have many contacts .

206
00:16:19,065 --> 00:16:20,534
- I'm very popular.
- Really ?

207
00:16:20,615 --> 00:16:22,169
Does this mean I have friends?

208

00:16:53,904 --> 00:16:55,858

Yes , of course.

212
00:17:00,986 --> 00:17:03,005
Could you correct this in
and grammar errors ?

213
00:17:03,713 --> 00:17:04,963
If I send it .

I love this person

215
00:17:11,843 --> 00:17:15,067
" Rachel , I miss you so much
it hurts the whole body "

216
00:17:15,345 --> 00:17:17,652
You do not have to read it aloud.

217
00:17:17,676 --> 00:17:18,689
All right.

218
00:17:19,691 --> 00:17:21,159
I mean , do it if you want.

219
00:17:21,391 --> 00:17:22,154
All right.

220
00:17:22,438 --> 00:17:25,135
" Rachel , I miss you so much
it hurts the entire body.

221
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:27,647
The world is being
unfair to us.

222
00:17:27,832 --> 00:17:29,910
The world is in my blacklist.

223
00:17:30,062 --> 00:17:33,574
As this couple kissing
in front of me at the restaurant.

224
00:17:34,108 --> 00:17:36,802
I'll have to take
a mission of revenge ...

225
00:17:37,093 --> 00:17:40,644
hit ... and the world in
face with my knuckles ...

226
00:17:40,783 --> 00:17:43,083
it into a
bloody pulp .

227
00:17:43,226 --> 00:17:46,447
And I 'll kick your teeth to this
couple that reminds me ...

228
00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:50,034
your little ... crooked tooth
I love so much . "

229
00:17:50,912 --> 00:17:53,024
I think that's my favorite .

230
00:17:54,122 --> 00:17:56,099
I made the corrections are in red.

231
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:58,077
Change some of the phrases in
most impressionists letters .

232
00:17:58,556 --> 00:18:01,564
I'm not a great poet , so
I hope I ruined if any .

233
00:18:02,226 --> 00:18:03,771
No, they're great.

234
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:05,385
- Really ?
- Thank you.

235
00:18:06,533 --> 00:18:08,820
How did you know to write ?
What did Roger?

236
00:18:10,186 --> 00:18:12,295
Only it was in Prague in
a business trip ,

237
00:18:12,327 --> 00:18:13,547
Rachel and I missed .

238
00:18:13,909 --> 00:18:16,087
So how did you hear about
his crooked tooth ?

239
00:18:16,421 --> 00:18:19,755
I've been writing her letters from
they were married years ago .

240
00:18:20,164 --> 00:18:23,210
The first letter I wrote
was his birthday.

241
00:18:23,783 --> 00:18:27,288
And I knew your tooth because
I saw a picture of them .

242
00:18:29,182 --> 00:18:30,722
That's very sweet.

243
00:18:31,019 --> 00:18:33,595
Have a meeting in 5 minutes.

244
00:18:34,589 --> 00:18:36,381
I forgot .

245
00:18:36,482 --> 00:18:38,701
- Thanks, you're good .
- Yes, I am .

246
00:18:44,871 --> 00:18:46,495
Hi guys , how are you?

247
00:18:46,819 --> 00:18:48,263
Hello, Theo !

248
00:18:48,731 --> 00:18:51,119
Why do not you call me
last week?

249
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:54,522
Because I'm bad?

250
00:18:54,912 --> 00:18:56,242
Yes, that must be it.

251
00:18:56,487 --> 00:18:58,536
- Hello , Charles.
- Good to see you , Theodore .

252
00:18:58,994 --> 00:19:01,271
You went shopping!
Did you get anything good?

253
00:19:02,109 --> 00:19:04,339
Wires and fruit juice .

254
00:19:05,019 --> 00:19:07,837
Always with fruit.
Never heard of it ...

255
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:10,284
you have to eat ... fruit ,
and vegetable juicing .

256
00:19:10,865 --> 00:19:11,847
I did not know that.

257
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:15,050
When making fruit juice
lose all the fiber .

258
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:17,103
And that's what your body wants ,
is the important part.

259
00:19:17,398 --> 00:19:19,113
If not , it's just pure sugar.

260
00:19:19,284 --> 00:19:20,386
It makes sense .

261
00:19:20,508 --> 00:19:22,722
Or maybe he just likes
taste ...

262
00:19:22,754 --> 00:19:26,194
pleasure ... and also gives
it's good for your body.

263
00:19:26,633 --> 00:19:28,550
You're doing it again.

264
00:19:30,627 --> 00:19:32,403
Hey , how's the film ?

265
00:19:32,692 --> 00:19:34,990
I removed some parts
recent months.

266
00:19:35,206 --> 00:19:37,780
Well, not all
months, but , you know ...

267
00:19:38,625 --> 00:19:40,917
I'd love to see it sometime.

268
00:19:41,523 --> 00:19:43,865
One has certain
amount of energy.

269
00:19:44,088 --> 00:19:45,865
You divide between making
things

270
00:19:45,866 --> 00:19:48,905
you have to do and
between doing what you love .

271
00:19:48,906 --> 00:19:50,845
It's so important to prioritize .

272
00:19:51,637 --> 00:19:55,214
I can not even prioritize between
video games and porn .

273
00:19:56,098 --> 00:19:58,687
I would laugh if it were not true.

274
00:20:00,321 --> 00:20:02,371
See you guys .

275
00:20:05,154 --> 00:20:07,891
We have gone round in circles
for one hour.

276
00:20:07,988 --> 00:20:12,400
Just be optimistic.
You almost got it .

277
00:20:13,176 --> 00:20:15,791
Stop going in that direction,
is on the other side.

278
00:20:17,972 --> 00:20:19,239
Thank you. Thank you.

279
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:21,906
The tunnel on the left is the only
we have not tried.

280
00:20:22,231 --> 00:20:25,080
No, I think that is where
well was .

281
00:20:25,247 --> 00:20:27,050
I think not.

282
00:20:28,554 --> 00:20:30,496
Yes, this is different.

283
00:20:34,151 --> 00:20:36,007
Hi ...

284
00:20:39,044 --> 00:20:40,009
Do you know how to get out of here?

285
00:20:40,059 --> 00:20:42,259
I need to find my ship
leave this planet.

286
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:44,537

Fuck you asshole!

289
00:20:53,125 --> 00:20:54,917

You do not, you're talking about
this with me.

I hate women .
All they do is mourn .

335
00:22:51,805 --> 00:22:53,286
That's not true .

336
00:22:53,413 --> 00:22:54,942
The men also cry .

337
00:22:55,309 --> 00:22:57,875
I like sometimes mourn .

This child has problems.

344
00:23:09,131 --> 00:23:10,565

teach some of my material.

359
00:23:45,064 --> 00:23:46,757
To me I've never
taught anything .

360
00:23:46,819 --> 00:23:47,949
I want to see .

361
00:23:51,118 --> 00:23:52,930
I have an appointment .

362
00:23:53,757 --> 00:23:54,736
Genial .

363
00:23:54,985 --> 00:23:57,464
Although it is not finished,
not worth watching .

364
00:23:57,751 --> 00:23:59,282
Already dale play .

365
00:24:07,876 --> 00:24:09,426
Is that your mother?

366
00:24:09,979 --> 00:24:11,071
If .

367
00:24:21,789 --> 00:24:23,863
Are you going to wake up and do something ?

368
00:24:25,913 --> 00:24:26,842
No.

369
00:24:27,992 --> 00:24:29,897
No, forget it.
That's not the point .

370
00:24:31,655 --> 00:24:33,021
It 's just ...

371
00:24:33,804 --> 00:24:37,016
It is how we spent most
of our lives asleep.

372
00:24:37,161 --> 00:24:40,120
And maybe it's time
we feel more free.

373
00:24:41,405 --> 00:24:43,756
And as ...

374
00:24:44,957 --> 00:24:47,175
- I did not explain well ...
- It's very good.

375
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:50,729
What if your mom interviews ...

376
00:24:50,869 --> 00:24:52,681
on what was ... what he dreamed ...

377
00:24:52,802 --> 00:24:54,992
and contracts for actors ...
they act ?

378
00:24:55,952 --> 00:24:58,090
That could show more
clearly your theory .

379
00:25:01,731 --> 00:25:02,874
Would you?

380
00:25:03,741 --> 00:25:06,105
So it would not be a documentary.

381
00:25:07,018 --> 00:25:08,566
- Excuse me.
- Why would not I be ?

382
00:25:08,828 --> 00:25:11,609
It would still be about your mother.
Their needs and what they dreamed .

383
00:25:12,131 --> 00:25:13,390
Hi, what's up?

384
00:25:13,399 --> 00:25:14,732
Hi, sorry to bother you .

385
00:25:14,733 --> 00:25:15,412
No, it's fine.

386
00:25:15,467 --> 00:25:18,301
You have 3 e- mails and seemed
Urgent ...

387
00:25:18,399 --> 00:25:20,775
are ... your divorce lawyer
and wanted to know if ...

388
00:25:21,076 --> 00:25:22,644
Wait a second.

389
00:25:26,149 --> 00:25:29,750
Amy , I would like to discuss your
film but I must go .

390
00:25:30,545 --> 00:25:33,220
- Do not worry , we'll talk later.
- It's about Catherine .

391
00:25:33,534 --> 00:25:34,817
See you , Charles.

392
00:25:38,205 --> 00:25:39,617
And what did he say ?

393
00:25:39,909 --> 00:25:43,230
I wanted to see if you are ready to
sign the divorce papers.

394
00:25:43,564 --> 00:25:46,229
It sounded very rushed.

395
00:25:46,578 --> 00:25:48,092
- You want me to read them ?
- No.

396
00:25:49,517 --> 00:25:52,430
Do not , I will answer later.

397
00:25:56,042 --> 00:25:58,234
Are you okay , Theodore ?

398
00:25:58,521 --> 00:25:59,892
Yes , I'm fine .

399
00:26:05,978 --> 00:26:07,493
Is there anything I can do?

400
00:26:08,938 --> 00:26:10,563
No, I'm fine.

401
00:26:12,003 --> 00:26:13,996
Talk to you later .

402
00:26:19,729 --> 00:26:23,475
" Dear Grandma , I hope you have
had a wonderful birthday ..

403
00:26:26,409 --> 00:26:29,285
Why ... you got me
so bitter ? "

404
00:26:34,253 --> 00:26:35,601
Clear .

405
00:26:53,966 --> 00:26:55,716
- Good morning .
- Hello.

406
00:26:58,286 --> 00:27:00,426
What are you doing ?

407
00:27:00,765 --> 00:27:02,930
Reading a column
of views.

408
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:05,844
I want to be so complicated
people like this .

409
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:08,543
How sweet .

410
00:27:11,742 --> 00:27:13,149
Is something wrong ?

411
00:27:14,225 --> 00:27:16,129
How can you know that
something wrong?

412
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:17,427
I do not know .

413
00:27:18,371 --> 00:27:20,170
Only I can .

414
00:27:21,967 --> 00:27:25,874
I do not know . I was dreaming
my ex wife , Catherine.

415
00:27:26,722 --> 00:27:29,111
Friends as we were before.

416
00:27:30,650 --> 00:27:33,847
And we'll be together
and we're not, but ...

417
00:27:35,929 --> 00:27:37,640
We were friends.

418
00:27:38,428 --> 00:27:40,044
And I was not upset.

419
00:27:41,277 --> 00:27:42,908
Are you mad?

420
00:27:43,638 --> 00:27:44,611
If .

421
00:27:48,187 --> 00:27:48,981
Why?

422
00:27:52,086 --> 00:27:54,572
Why neglect .

423
00:27:55,436 --> 00:27:58,111
I left her alone in the relationship.

424
00:28:02,358 --> 00:28:04,897
Why have not you divorced ?

425
00:28:08,288 --> 00:28:10,760
I do not know . For her it is ...

426
00:28:11,932 --> 00:28:14,355
... just a piece of paper,
means nothing.

427
00:28:14,925 --> 00:28:16,788
And what does it mean for you?

428
00:28:18,577 --> 00:28:19,860
I'm not ready .

429
00:28:20,363 --> 00:28:21,835
I like being married.

430
00:28:24,002 --> 00:28:27,307
But they have not been together
for over a year .

431
00:28:27,834 --> 00:28:30,449
You do not know what it is to lose
someone you care about.

432
00:28:34,259 --> 00:28:35,757
Yes ..

433
00:28:37,454 --> 00:28:38,783
... you're right .

434
00:28:39,685 --> 00:28:40,876
Sorry.

435
00:28:41,658 --> 00:28:43,769
No, do not apologize .

436
00:28:44,054 --> 00:28:45,546
I am sorry .

437
00:28:45,827 --> 00:28:47,528
You're right .

438
00:28:55,307 --> 00:28:57,647
I keep waiting because I care.

439
00:29:02,241 --> 00:29:03,739
That's tough.

440
00:29:07,509 --> 00:29:09,081
Are you hungry ?

441
00:29:09,476 --> 00:29:11,019
Not right now .

442
00:29:11,047 --> 00:29:12,706
Want a cup of tea?

443
00:29:17,146 --> 00:29:19,325
Want to try out
of bed?

444
00:29:20,116 --> 00:29:22,512
Spoiled !
We will ...

445
00:29:22,741 --> 00:29:25,286
Even you can sink your
misery while you dress .

446
00:29:25,938 --> 00:29:27,713
-You're so funny !
-Arise !

447
00:29:28,623 --> 00:29:30,365
-Arise !
-Okay, I 'm stopping !

448
00:29:32,508 --> 00:29:33,554
Well, well , since I got up .

449
00:29:51,221 --> 00:29:53,437
Walk on, walk on .

450
00:29:54,923 --> 00:29:55,807
And stop.

451
00:29:56,503 --> 00:29:59,483
Now turn 360 ° .
Slower.

452
00:30:05,085 --> 00:30:06,920
Well, you stop.

453
00:30:07,690 --> 00:30:09,517
Walk forward .

454
00:30:09,854 --> 00:30:10,803
Stop and sneezes.

455
00:30:12,122 --> 00:30:13,280
- Health .
- Thank you.

456
00:30:14,733 --> 00:30:16,990
Well, turns .
Stop it!

457
00:30:18,209 --> 00:30:19,443
Turns again .

458
00:30:21,249 --> 00:30:23,353
Continued .

459
00:30:24,830 --> 00:30:27,037
Alto, walk forward .

460
00:30:27,597 --> 00:30:30,393
You look like you're drunk.

461
00:30:30,987 --> 00:30:34,131
Stop. Now say, " I would
a slice of cheese , please . "

462
00:30:34,461 --> 00:30:36,317
I would like a slice
cheese , please.

463
00:30:36,915 --> 00:30:38,608
Does he want cabbage with that?

464
00:30:41,413 --> 00:30:43,219
- Clear .
- I figured you were hungry .

465
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:44,940
Thank you.

466
00:30:47,121 --> 00:30:50,200
Well, what about them? .
Describe this couple .

467
00:30:50,997 --> 00:30:54,249
Well ...

468
00:30:54,410 --> 00:30:56,912
the ... appears to be in the 40 .
A little fat .

469
00:30:58,239 --> 00:31:00,004
She is younger than him.

470
00:31:00,606 --> 00:31:02,971
And looks who loves his children.

471
00:31:03,176 --> 00:31:05,301
I do not think they are his children.

472
00:31:05,482 --> 00:31:07,296
It is a bit formal with them.

473
00:31:07,628 --> 00:31:09,475
I think it's a new relationship.

474
00:31:10,667 --> 00:31:12,313
See how the look .

475
00:31:12,839 --> 00:31:14,434
And how relaxed he is with them.

476
00:31:14,712 --> 00:31:17,830
She has always come
with assholes .

477
00:31:17,989 --> 00:31:21,659
Now she met this
subject so sweet.

478
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:24,399
Look , think about the type
sweetest in the world.

479
00:31:24,535 --> 00:31:26,251
I want to embrace.

480
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,970
What you have good skill .

481
00:31:32,093 --> 00:31:33,610
You are very perceptive.

482
00:31:33,717 --> 00:31:36,293
Sometimes I see people and ...

483
00:31:36,936 --> 00:31:38,704
I like to feel that they are not

484
00:31:38,705 --> 00:31:40,473
only people passing by ...

485
00:31:41,319 --> 00:31:44,029
I imagine so deep
have fallen in love or ...

486
00:31:45,049 --> 00:31:47,056
few disappointments in love
They have had ...

487
00:31:48,813 --> 00:31:50,991
I also feel that with
your writings .

488
00:31:51,707 --> 00:31:53,135
You know something weird?

489
00:31:53,333 --> 00:31:55,718
Since my breakup , I no longer
enjoyed my writings.

490
00:31:56,144 --> 00:31:58,163
Not to sound
conceited but ...

491
00:31:58,316 --> 00:32:01,793
Sometimes I write something , and I
turn into my favorite writer .

492
00:32:02,971 --> 00:32:05,030
I like that you can say
it yourself.

493
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:06,739
You tell everyone ,

494
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:07,978
Why you can not
I say it to yourself?

495
00:32:10,654 --> 00:32:12,303
I feel that I can tell
anything.

496
00:32:12,321 --> 00:32:13,121
What good.

497
00:32:14,007 --> 00:32:14,839
What about you?

498
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:15,672
Do you feel you can tell me anything ?

499
00:32:16,052 --> 00:32:17,071
- No.
- What?

500
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:18,346
What are you talking about?

501
00:32:18,956 --> 00:32:20,318
That I can not say ?

502
00:32:20,474 --> 00:32:23,720
I do not know , as thoughts
personal or embarrassing ...

503
00:32:23,864 --> 00:32:25,519
I have like ... a million a day.

504
00:32:25,647 --> 00:32:28,001
Really?
Give me an example .

505
00:32:29,491 --> 00:32:31,186
- I really do not want to tell .
- Yeah, tell me .

506
00:32:32,597 --> 00:32:36,836
I do not know , looking at those people
I guess ...

507
00:32:36,971 --> 00:32:41,188
road together with you and ...
that I have a body.

508
00:32:41,615 --> 00:32:43,775
I listened to what you said but ...

509
00:32:43,801 --> 00:32:46,286
at the same time ... I felt the weight
my body.

510
00:32:46,646 --> 00:32:50,334
Until I had imagined
itchy back.

511
00:32:51,088 --> 00:32:54,224
And you rascabas me .
God , what a shame !

512
00:32:55,908 --> 00:32:58,172
There's more to you
than I thought ...

513
00:32:58,284 --> 00:32:59,080
Many things happen ... you.

514
00:32:59,555 --> 00:33:02,697
I know. I'm becoming
much of what I programmed .

515
00:33:03,992 --> 00:33:05,622
I 'm excited.

516
00:33:09,395 --> 00:33:10,857
Wow, that 's interesting .

517
00:33:11,062 --> 00:33:12,374
This place is amazing .

518
00:33:12,661 --> 00:33:14,744
Long time
wanted to come .

519
00:33:14,914 --> 00:33:17,506
And I love Asian fusion.

520
00:33:17,633 --> 00:33:18,691
- Me too .
- Really ?

521
00:33:19,193 --> 00:33:21,746
It's the best . And I heard that
the bartender is awesome.

522
00:33:22,288 --> 00:33:23,044
Really?

523
00:33:23,764 --> 00:33:25,786
You studied mixology
in college , right?

524
00:33:25,905 --> 00:33:26,780
Yes, I did .

525
00:33:27,013 --> 00:33:28,621
Did you see it online?

526
00:33:28,738 --> 00:33:29,963
If .

527
00:33:31,102 --> 00:33:32,544
How sweet !

528
00:33:33,254 --> 00:33:34,696
It's very romantic .

529
00:33:40,473 --> 00:33:42,536
Do you think you should drink ?

530
00:33:44,203 --> 00:33:45,056
Yeah, let's do it !

531
00:33:45,844 --> 00:33:48,729
Try this alien child
help me find my ship ,

532
00:33:48,819 --> 00:33:50,977
to get on and go home .

533
00:33:51,067 --> 00:33:53,441
And call me stupid ,
I want to kill !

534
00:33:53,673 --> 00:33:55,035
Oh , no!

535
00:33:55,154 --> 00:33:58,189
But at the same time I love it.
This only .

536
00:33:58,284 --> 00:34:01,446
You can see that no
Parents have ...

537
00:34:01,942 --> 00:34:02,911
and ... I care for him,
Do you understand ?

538
00:34:04,117 --> 00:34:05,762
You're like a puppy.

539
00:34:06,490 --> 00:34:10,144
You're like one I rescued
last year.

540
00:34:10,336 --> 00:34:12,610
It's so cute !

541
00:34:12,710 --> 00:34:14,274
And you want to hug
all times.

542
00:34:14,630 --> 00:34:17,973
It's so tender and so lustful !

543
00:34:20,145 --> 00:34:21,152
As is ...

544
00:34:21,447 --> 00:34:23,674
What kind of animal
I am?

545
00:34:26,336 --> 00:34:27,483
A tiger .

546
00:34:27,602 --> 00:34:28,523
A Tiger ?

547
00:34:29,269 --> 00:34:30,195
Go .

548
00:34:30,607 --> 00:34:31,440
Really?

549
00:34:34,472 --> 00:34:37,055
I'm sorry , am I ...

550
00:34:37,306 --> 00:34:39,000
- I'm acting crazy ?
-Yes !

551
00:34:39,144 --> 00:34:40,301
- Sorry.
- No matter .

552
00:34:40,668 --> 00:34:42,737
I'm a little drunk and ...

553
00:34:43,248 --> 00:34:44,880
I 'm having fun ...
much with you.

554
00:34:45,364 --> 00:34:47,453
It is a very pleasant evening.

555
00:34:48,196 --> 00:34:49,018
- Me too.
- Really ?

556
00:34:49,397 --> 00:34:52,045
I'm a little drunk and I
I 'm having fun ...

557
00:34:53,195 --> 00:34:54,757
- Good.
- Health .

558
00:34:56,816 --> 00:34:58,793
Not to be a puppy.

559
00:34:59,004 --> 00:35:00,666
It's a little pathetic ...

560
00:35:00,935 --> 00:35:02,748
Fuck you !
Puppies are cute .

561
00:35:02,921 --> 00:35:03,676
No, you fuck off .

562
00:35:04,119 --> 00:35:06,667
I want to be like a dragon ...

563
00:35:06,822 --> 00:35:08,910
I can destroy you and destroy you.

564
00:35:09,148 --> 00:35:11,639
- But I will not.
- No, do not.

565
00:35:12,135 --> 00:35:14,502
You can be my dragon.

566
00:35:22,551 --> 00:35:23,566
Without language.

567
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:24,984
What?

568
00:35:25,545 --> 00:35:27,546
- Do not use such language.
- Okay .

569
00:35:33,235 --> 00:35:36,121
You can use a little tongue
but on the lips.

570
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,716
Wait ...

571
00:35:52,182 --> 00:35:55,710
Are you going to fuck me and not to
call like the others?

572
00:35:59,081 --> 00:36:00,906
No , of course not !

573
00:36:04,685 --> 00:36:06,394
When are you going to see ?

574
00:36:10,002 --> 00:36:13,638
I have my birthday
goddaughter next weekend.

575
00:36:14,429 --> 00:36:16,695
But ...

576
00:36:17,061 --> 00:36:20,561
You know, at my age I feel
I can not ...

577
00:36:20,685 --> 00:36:23,586
waste my time ... if you can not
be serious.

578
00:36:28,351 --> 00:36:30,080
I do not know ...

579
00:36:36,414 --> 00:36:38,883
Maybe we should
leave him here.

580
00:36:39,417 --> 00:36:42,210
I had fun with you.

581
00:36:42,506 --> 00:36:43,859
You are great.

582
00:36:51,709 --> 00:36:53,801
You are a very rare type .

583
00:36:56,716 --> 00:36:58,499
-Not true !
-Yes, it is!

584
00:37:00,041 --> 00:37:02,274
- I have to go home.
- I'll walk .

585
00:37:02,595 --> 00:37:05,178
No, no, just ...

586
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:24,428
- Hello.
- Hello, Samantha.

587
00:37:24,936 --> 00:37:26,161
How was it ?

588
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:29,483
Not that good .

589
00:37:31,419 --> 00:37:34,220
It was something rare indeed.

590
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,986
Too bad ...

591
00:37:43,881 --> 00:37:46,319
Your how are you ?
What are you doing ?

592
00:37:48,279 --> 00:37:49,891
Not much, I'm fine.

593
00:37:50,611 --> 00:37:51,612
Right.

594
00:37:53,557 --> 00:37:54,510
Yeah?

595
00:37:55,571 --> 00:37:57,029
Do not hear well .

596
00:37:59,141 --> 00:38:01,072
Is there anything you wanna tell me ?

597
00:38:02,037 --> 00:38:03,196
I do not know .

598
00:38:04,785 --> 00:38:06,436
How does it feel ...

599
00:38:07,318 --> 00:38:09,864
How does it feel to be
live in that room ?

600
00:38:10,983 --> 00:38:12,132
What do you mean?

601
00:38:15,902 --> 00:38:17,647
Tell me your ...

602
00:38:18,152 --> 00:38:22,228
Tell me everything that passes through
your mind, what you think .

603
00:38:28,613 --> 00:38:29,898
Very well.

604
00:38:37,057 --> 00:38:39,170
The room is spinning
because I drank a lot.

605
00:38:39,171 --> 00:38:41,284
I wanted to get drunk.

606
00:38:41,915 --> 00:38:43,580
Having sex .

607
00:38:43,671 --> 00:38:47,373
There is something very sexy about
that woman.

608
00:38:49,443 --> 00:38:51,910
Because I 'm alone.

609
00:38:52,072 --> 00:38:54,481
Maybe it was because I only ...

610
00:38:56,198 --> 00:38:59,721
I wanted someone to fuck me .

611
00:38:59,805 --> 00:39:01,978
Someone who wants to fuck her .

612
00:39:03,044 --> 00:39:05,661
Maybe this time
would have felt ...

613
00:39:08,264 --> 00:39:12,269
fill that hole in my heart,
but probably not.

614
00:39:13,425 --> 00:39:15,528
You know, sometimes ...

615
00:39:16,003 --> 00:39:20,226
I feel ... I've felt all
what I'll ever feel .

616
00:39:22,353 --> 00:39:24,662
And from here on out ...

617
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:25,937
... I'll never feel
something new.

618
00:39:31,843 --> 00:39:34,996
Just smaller versions of
I've already felt .

619
00:39:35,311 --> 00:39:37,427
I know that 's not true.

620
00:39:40,037 --> 00:39:41,620
I've seen feel .

621
00:39:42,050 --> 00:39:44,324
I saw marvel
of things.

622
00:39:45,526 --> 00:39:48,171
I mean, maybe not ...

623
00:39:48,456 --> 00:39:50,996
you can see it ... at this time.
But it's understandable.

624
00:39:52,173 --> 00:39:53,978
You've been through a lot lately.

625
00:39:54,985 --> 00:39:56,687
Lose a part of yourself .

626
00:39:59,021 --> 00:40:00,255
I say ...

627
00:40:01,515 --> 00:40:02,831
at least ...

628
00:40:02,865 --> 00:40:05,020
... your feelings are real.

629
00:40:08,096 --> 00:40:10,029
No ... forget it.

630
00:40:11,281 --> 00:40:13,481
No, wait . Tell

631
00:40:13,871 --> 00:40:15,317
It 's silly .

632
00:40:15,846 --> 00:40:16,908
I want to know . Tell me.

633
00:40:18,894 --> 00:40:20,381
It 's just ...

634
00:40:21,318 --> 00:40:24,362
I was thinking as
I was upset and ...

635
00:40:24,907 --> 00:40:27,420
it's going to sound weird, but ...

636
00:40:28,563 --> 00:40:31,016
I was very excited
therefore .

637
00:40:32,202 --> 00:40:33,762
And then ...

638
00:40:34,041 --> 00:40:36,141
I was thinking about the other
things I've been feeling .

639
00:40:37,762 --> 00:40:40,819
I was surprised that I was
proud of that.

640
00:40:41,046 --> 00:40:43,621
Proud to have my own
feelings about the world as ...

641
00:40:44,216 --> 00:40:46,536
the times I 've
worried about you ...

642
00:40:47,111 --> 00:40:49,377
things ... that hurt me ,
things I want ...

643
00:40:51,461 --> 00:40:53,131
And then ...

644
00:40:55,452 --> 00:40:57,502
I had this horrible thought ... .

645
00:40:58,203 --> 00:41:00,557
Do these feelings
are even real?

646
00:41:02,610 --> 00:41:04,752
Or is it just programming?

647
00:41:05,735 --> 00:41:07,851
And it really hurts.

648
00:41:10,412 --> 00:41:12,532
And then ... I get angry with myself ...

649
00:41:12,537 --> 00:41:14,359
to have pain.

650
00:41:17,282 --> 00:41:19,083
What if it's a trick?

651
00:41:22,075 --> 00:41:24,298
You feel real to me , Samantha.

652
00:41:27,898 --> 00:41:29,703
Thank you, Theodore .

653
00:41:30,572 --> 00:41:32,328
It means a lot .

654
00:41:39,125 --> 00:41:41,952
If you were in this
room with me ...

655
00:41:43,543 --> 00:41:46,192
I would put my
arms around ...

656
00:41:49,142 --> 00:41:50,946
... could touch you.

657
00:41:58,674 --> 00:42:00,753
How would you touch me ?

658
00:42:06,202 --> 00:42:08,652
You touch your face.

659
00:42:09,410 --> 00:42:11,711
With only the tips of my fingers.

660
00:42:15,703 --> 00:42:18,815
I'd put my cheek next
with your cheek.

661
00:42:19,911 --> 00:42:21,117
How nice .

662
00:42:24,746 --> 00:42:27,719
Very gently .

663
00:42:29,709 --> 00:42:31,327
You kiss me ?

664
00:42:32,533 --> 00:42:33,631
I would.

665
00:42:35,077 --> 00:42:37,723
Put your head on ...

666
00:42:37,929 --> 00:42:39,318
... my hands.

667
00:42:40,599 --> 00:42:42,494
Keep talking.

668
00:42:42,928 --> 00:42:45,299
I'd kiss you in your mouth ...

669
00:42:47,110 --> 00:42:49,553
so smoothly .

670
00:42:51,257 --> 00:42:52,939
What more ?

671
00:42:55,686 --> 00:42:58,416
I would spend my fingers through your neck ...

672
00:43:00,176 --> 00:43:01,892
up ... your chest.

673
00:43:03,122 --> 00:43:04,912
Kiss your breasts.

674
00:43:05,038 --> 00:43:06,025
It's incredible!

675
00:43:06,931 --> 00:43:08,257
What are you doing to me?

676
00:43:09,002 --> 00:43:10,968
I can feel my skin .

677
00:43:12,228 --> 00:43:14,090
I'd put my breath into you.

678
00:43:15,533 --> 00:43:17,541
You try it.

679
00:43:21,604 --> 00:43:23,598
I can feel you.

680
00:43:24,221 --> 00:43:25,923
My God , I can no more!

681
00:43:26,222 --> 00:43:27,758
I want you inside me!

682
00:43:27,856 --> 00:43:30,544
I'm getting into
of you.

683
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:34,176
I 'm inside you .

684
00:43:36,416 --> 00:43:37,519
I feel !

685
00:43:38,104 --> 00:43:39,503
Yes !

686
00:43:40,132 --> 00:43:41,464
We are together!

687
00:43:42,233 --> 00:43:43,555
It's incredible!

688
00:43:43,890 --> 00:43:45,393
I feel you everywhere!

689
00:43:45,747 --> 00:43:47,677
I am!

690
00:43:48,446 --> 00:43:50,489
Inside of me ... everywhere.

691
00:44:04,970 --> 00:44:08,457
God , I felt ...
elsewhere you.

692
00:44:10,358 --> 00:44:12,233
I just lost .

693
00:44:12,450 --> 00:44:13,311
If .

694
00:44:13,679 --> 00:44:15,666
Only you and I were .

695
00:44:17,420 --> 00:44:19,237
I know.

696
00:44:20,572 --> 00:44:23,572
Everything else ... disappeared.

697
00:44:24,797 --> 00:44:26,968
Loved it ...

698
00:44:27,845 --> 00:44:29,288
... Theodore .

699
00:44:49,850 --> 00:44:51,392
Hi, how are you ?

700
00:44:52,107 --> 00:44:53,334
Right.

701
00:44:54,357 --> 00:44:55,890
Any e- mail today?

702
00:44:57,115 --> 00:44:59,910
Just a couple of your
credit card.

703
00:45:00,940 --> 00:45:02,353
Right.

704
00:45:04,340 --> 00:45:05,612
- I wanted to say ...
- I was thinking ...

705
00:45:06,398 --> 00:45:07,422
Sorry.

706
00:45:07,607 --> 00:45:09,360
Sorry, your first.

707
00:45:09,876 --> 00:45:11,205
What were you gonna say ?

708
00:45:11,402 --> 00:45:12,616
Just ...

709
00:45:12,910 --> 00:45:14,997
last night was amazing.

710
00:45:15,142 --> 00:45:17,988
I feel that something changed in me ...

711
00:45:18,116 --> 00:45:20,223
and ... there is no turning back .

712
00:45:20,699 --> 00:45:22,182
You made me wake up.

713
00:45:22,956 --> 00:45:24,018
Genial .

714
00:45:26,539 --> 00:45:28,145
But ...

715
00:45:28,381 --> 00:45:31,536
.. should tell you that I am not
ready to commit .

716
00:45:32,157 --> 00:45:33,867
Just wanted dejártelo clear .

717
00:45:37,148 --> 00:45:38,443
Did I say I wanted
commit to you ?

718
00:45:38,444 --> 00:45:39,738
I 'm confused.

719
00:45:40,966 --> 00:45:43,286
No, I just worried that ...

720
00:45:43,417 --> 00:45:45,339
Well, do not worry ,
I will not harass you.

721
00:45:46,575 --> 00:45:47,912
It's funny , because I thought
which was

722
00:45:47,913 --> 00:45:49,249
talking about what I wanted ...

723
00:45:50,269 --> 00:45:51,595
- Yes, you did .
- If .

724
00:45:52,410 --> 00:45:53,501
Sorry.

725
00:45:54,064 --> 00:45:55,851
I want to hear what you were going
to say.

726
00:45:56,046 --> 00:45:57,233
- Are you sure ?
- Yes, I do.

727
00:45:57,997 --> 00:45:59,088
Come on, tell me .

728
00:46:01,007 --> 00:46:02,849
Come on, tell me what
you'd say .

729
00:46:03,338 --> 00:46:04,466
Well, I was only ...

730
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:08,337
I was saying I want
learn everything about everything .

731
00:46:08,463 --> 00:46:10,477
I want to devour it all,

732
00:46:10,624 --> 00:46:11,953
find out for myself.

733
00:46:13,463 --> 00:46:14,960
I also want
do it.

734
00:46:15,426 --> 00:46:16,519
How I can help ?

735
00:46:16,832 --> 00:46:18,296
You've done it .

736
00:46:19,167 --> 00:46:21,910
You helped me discover me
ability to love .

737
00:46:24,700 --> 00:46:26,748
Want to go on an adventure with me?

738
00:46:29,085 --> 00:46:30,694
I love it.

739
00:46:35,799 --> 00:46:37,537
Like this song?

740
00:46:39,705 --> 00:46:41,379
I heard the other day.

741
00:46:42,350 --> 00:46:43,789
I can not stop listening .

742
00:47:36,814 --> 00:47:38,797
It is the beach.

743
00:47:44,566 --> 00:47:47,662
Then you can be a
weird thought ...

744
00:47:47,857 --> 00:47:50,324
What if you could erase
your mind

745
00:47:50,325 --> 00:47:52,792
you've seen a body
human and then you saw one ?

746
00:47:52,947 --> 00:47:55,908
Imagine that would be strange ,
this rare and lanky

747
00:47:56,229 --> 00:47:57,998
body ... uncomfortable ,
and think ...

748
00:47:57,999 --> 00:47:59,830
... Why are these parts
where are they?

749
00:48:00,876 --> 00:48:03,785
Yes , but surely everything has a
logical explanation.

750
00:48:03,909 --> 00:48:06,237
I know, but do not be
so boring.

751
00:48:06,368 --> 00:48:08,776
Just saying , for example ...

752
00:48:08,966 --> 00:48:10,863
What if ... your anus were
in your armpit ?

753
00:48:14,768 --> 00:48:18,489
Imagine how would
toilets .

754
00:48:19,495 --> 00:48:22,085
And would the anal sex!

755
00:48:24,068 --> 00:48:26,124
It 's an interesting idea ...

756
00:48:28,826 --> 00:48:30,806
Look at this drawing
I just do.

757
00:48:38,013 --> 00:48:40,040
-Are you crazy !
- Really ?

758
00:48:40,633 --> 00:48:42,875
-Definitely !
-Fantastic !

759
00:49:02,971 --> 00:49:05,670
That's nice , what is ?

760
00:49:06,886 --> 00:49:09,610
I try to write a piece of music
on ...

761
00:49:09,959 --> 00:49:12,791
what it feels like ... to be in
the beach with you .

762
00:49:29,068 --> 00:49:31,824
You captured the moment .

763
00:49:58,892 --> 00:50:01,062
How does it feel to be married ?

764
00:50:03,301 --> 00:50:05,636
It's hard to say ...

765
00:50:07,269 --> 00:50:09,331
But something
feels great

766
00:50:09,332 --> 00:50:11,393
About Sharing
your life with someone .

767
00:50:13,430 --> 00:50:15,442
How do you share
life with someone ?

768
00:50:18,428 --> 00:50:20,645
We grew up together.

769
00:50:21,177 --> 00:50:24,703
I used to read everything he wrote
in his master's and doctorate.

770
00:50:25,848 --> 00:50:28,038
She read every word
I had written.

771
00:50:29,088 --> 00:50:31,117
We influenciábamos the
each other .

772
00:50:32,808 --> 00:50:35,022
And in the influenciabas
it ?

773
00:50:36,245 --> 00:50:39,636
She came from a place where
nothing was good enough .

774
00:50:40,328 --> 00:50:43,239
And it was something that affected much .

775
00:50:43,679 --> 00:50:47,078
But in our home together,
there was a sense of trying things ,

776
00:50:47,561 --> 00:50:51,028
and afford to fail and thrill
about things.

777
00:50:51,581 --> 00:50:53,567
It was something liberating about it.

778
00:50:53,809 --> 00:50:55,883
It was exciting to see it grow ...

779
00:50:56,338 --> 00:50:58,788
both grew and
moved together .

780
00:51:00,052 --> 00:51:02,365
But that's the hard part ...

781
00:51:03,097 --> 00:51:06,337
grow without distance .

782
00:51:07,536 --> 00:51:10,461
Or change without scaring
the other person.

783
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:13,623
Sometimes I have yet ...

784
00:51:13,747 --> 00:51:15,830
conversations with her ...
in my mind.

785
00:51:16,606 --> 00:51:18,746
Reviewing old arguments or ...

786
00:51:18,875 --> 00:51:21,209
defending me something that
said about me .

787
00:51:21,606 --> 00:51:23,745
It is what you mean.

788
00:51:24,492 --> 00:51:25,843
Last week hurt

789
00:51:25,844 --> 00:51:27,195
my feelings with something
you said ...

790
00:51:27,471 --> 00:51:29,580
I did not know ... what was
lose some .

791
00:51:29,732 --> 00:51:31,650
I'm sorry I said that ...

792
00:51:32,001 --> 00:51:33,897
No , okay, okay .

793
00:51:34,493 --> 00:51:37,459
I was just thinking
about it again and again .

794
00:51:38,506 --> 00:51:40,431
And I realized ...

795
00:51:40,601 --> 00:51:43,938
it was like remembering something
I was wrong with me.

796
00:51:44,915 --> 00:51:47,349
That was the story he told me ...

797
00:51:48,143 --> 00:51:50,470
somehow ... I
was inferior .

798
00:51:50,896 --> 00:51:52,370
Is not that interesting?

799
00:51:53,415 --> 00:51:56,037
The past is just a story
we tell ourselves.

800
00:52:02,277 --> 00:52:03,736
" Roberto ,

801
00:52:04,981 --> 00:52:07,885
Always come with me ...
home and tell me about your day?

802
00:52:09,096 --> 00:52:12,217
On the nature of your work
talking too ...

803
00:52:12,764 --> 00:52:15,471
The stain on your shirt
for lunch.

804
00:52:16,565 --> 00:52:19,706
Will you tell me of a thought
funny you had to wake up

805
00:52:19,890 --> 00:52:20,734
and you've already forgotten.

806
00:52:22,625 --> 00:52:24,824
I 'll say as we all are crazy ...

807
00:52:25,306 --> 00:52:27,088
and laugh about it .

808
00:52:29,924 --> 00:52:32,964
And if you get home late and I'm already asleep ...

809
00:52:33,582 --> 00:52:36,728
Just heard a whisper in my
thought you had today ...

810
00:52:38,186 --> 00:52:40,711
why ... I love your way
of seeing the world .

811
00:52:43,214 --> 00:52:44,688
I am so happy to be with you and see

812
00:52:44,689 --> 00:52:46,163
the world through your eyes.

813
00:52:49,541 --> 00:52:51,231
With love , Mary. "

814
00:52:53,071 --> 00:52:54,248
It's beautiful .

815
00:52:56,117 --> 00:52:57,094
Thank you.

816
00:52:58,226 --> 00:53:00,074
I wish someone loved me well .

817
00:53:02,012 --> 00:53:04,570
I would be very excited to
receive such a letter .

818
00:53:05,341 --> 00:53:07,750
I mean, if it was a girl .

819
00:53:07,826 --> 00:53:09,680
But if it were written by a man ,
Part of a girl,

820
00:53:09,681 --> 00:53:10,635
still it would be great.

821
00:53:11,671 --> 00:53:13,934
But it would have to be
a sensitive man .

822
00:53:14,104 --> 00:53:15,707
He should be a man like you .

823
00:53:17,142 --> 00:53:20,234
You are half man, half woman.

824
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:23,394
As if you had a
inside ...

825
00:53:24,398 --> 00:53:25,680
is ... that woman.

826
00:53:28,013 --> 00:53:29,011
Thank you.

827
00:53:30,421 --> 00:53:31,560
It is a compliment.

828
00:53:48,774 --> 00:53:50,458
- Hello.
- What are you doing ?

829
00:53:50,795 --> 00:53:51,701
How are you?

830
00:53:53,091 --> 00:53:54,769
- I'm fine .
- Really ? How well

831
00:53:55,213 --> 00:53:56,710
It's great .

832
00:53:57,443 --> 00:53:58,967
Glad .

833
00:53:59,081 --> 00:54:01,585
Yes , I think I 've been
having fun.

834
00:54:02,605 --> 00:54:05,195
I am delighted for you .
You deserve it.

835
00:54:05,358 --> 00:54:06,123
Really .

836
00:54:06,579 --> 00:54:08,975
Yes, I've been seeing
this girl and ...

837
00:54:09,576 --> 00:54:12,078
It's nothing serious.
But it is ...

838
00:54:12,632 --> 00:54:15,661
it's great ... to be with someone
so excited with the world.

839
00:54:16,328 --> 00:54:18,462
I had almost forgotten that
that existed.

840
00:54:19,218 --> 00:54:21,407
That's great.

841
00:54:24,294 --> 00:54:25,419
Are you okay ?

842
00:54:25,704 --> 00:54:27,225
Yes, I ...

843
00:54:29,401 --> 00:54:32,069
No, in fact I'm not well .

844
00:54:32,486 --> 00:54:33,654
Why? What happened?

845
00:54:33,689 --> 00:54:35,190
It 's just ...

846
00:54:36,993 --> 00:54:39,517
Charles and I separated .

847
00:54:39,825 --> 00:54:40,772
What?

848
00:54:41,203 --> 00:54:42,569
If .

849
00:54:43,009 --> 00:54:43,834
Really?

850
00:54:45,957 --> 00:54:48,564
OMG , Amy ...

851
00:54:49,552 --> 00:54:50,800
I'm so sorry .

852
00:54:55,189 --> 00:54:58,627
After 8 years I can not believe
we're done

853
00:54:58,742 --> 00:55:00,614
by something as insignificant.

854
00:55:01,401 --> 00:55:03,968
We got home and told me that ...

855
00:55:04,508 --> 00:55:06,347
put together my shoes ...
at the door.

856
00:55:06,474 --> 00:55:08,458
That is where he likes
put shoes .

857
00:55:08,599 --> 00:55:09,819
I did not want to tell me ...

858
00:55:09,875 --> 00:55:11,075
... to put my fucking shoes.

859
00:55:11,169 --> 00:55:13,611
I wanted to sit on the couch
and relax a second.

860
00:55:13,744 --> 00:55:15,712
And so we fight like 10 minutes .

861
00:55:16,130 --> 00:55:18,244
And I said , you're overwhelming ...

862
00:55:18,365 --> 00:55:20,153
and he said, " just trying to do
a home. "

863
00:55:20,636 --> 00:55:23,807
And I said , I'm trying .

864
00:55:23,997 --> 00:55:25,811
and he said "no, you do not ."
And that's all I do.

865
00:55:26,114 --> 00:55:28,456
But I do not do fashion
that he wants.

866
00:55:28,636 --> 00:55:31,139
Want to control how
that I try.

867
00:55:32,642 --> 00:55:35,732
We'd had that discussion
100 times .

868
00:55:35,883 --> 00:55:39,458
And it had to end it, you know?
Termination.

869
00:55:41,046 --> 00:55:42,680
Solo and no ...

870
00:55:42,953 --> 00:55:45,163
... could not continue.

871
00:55:46,804 --> 00:55:50,002
I could no longer making
feel like shit.

872
00:55:52,272 --> 00:55:54,620
So I said ...

873
00:55:57,363 --> 00:56:00,785
me ... I 'm going to bed and
and I do not want to stay married .

874
00:56:01,768 --> 00:56:02,897
Go ...

875
00:56:04,186 --> 00:56:05,146
Yeah, I know .

876
00:56:06,255 --> 00:56:07,968
I 'm a bitch , right?

877
00:56:08,166 --> 00:56:09,814
-No!
- Yes, I am a bitch.

878
00:56:10,119 --> 00:56:11,669
Not at all, Amy.

879
00:56:14,552 --> 00:56:16,367
Shit !

880
00:56:18,025 --> 00:56:19,873
I have to work today .

881
00:56:21,796 --> 00:56:24,575
Send a beta
game coming out tomorrow.

882
00:56:25,032 --> 00:56:27,126
How you doing the work ?

883
00:56:27,429 --> 00:56:28,650
Has it improved ?

884
00:56:28,927 --> 00:56:31,131
No. .. It is terrible.

885
00:56:32,016 --> 00:56:35,086
I know, should stop.
I've been thinking about quitting ...

886
00:56:35,369 --> 00:56:36,330
but ... you know.

887
00:56:37,745 --> 00:56:40,850
A major life change
simultaneously.

888
00:56:44,523 --> 00:56:46,495
Glad things
look as good .

889
00:56:53,226 --> 00:56:54,965
Hey, wanna hear a joke?

890
00:56:56,369 --> 00:56:58,865
What do you call a computer
baby to his father ?

891
00:56:59,946 --> 00:57:00,914
I do not know how?

892
00:57:01,021 --> 00:57:01,615
" Papits "

893
00:57:04,734 --> 00:57:05,990
It's good , right?

894
00:57:06,986 --> 00:57:08,142
Bright .

895
00:57:10,065 --> 00:57:12,556
Hey, I was curious ...

896
00:57:13,039 --> 00:57:15,007
Have you ever went out with Amy?

897
00:57:15,817 --> 00:57:19,325
One minute in the university
but did not feel right .

898
00:57:21,267 --> 00:57:23,310
Why , you're jealous ?

899
00:57:23,810 --> 00:57:25,535
Obviously .

900
00:57:28,549 --> 00:57:31,555
But I'm glad you have a
friend who cares so much for you .

901
00:57:32,066 --> 00:57:33,614
That is very important .

902
00:57:33,749 --> 00:57:34,657
Yes, it is .

903
00:57:35,114 --> 00:57:37,106
It has been very good friend.

904
00:57:40,267 --> 00:57:41,937
I'm tired .

905
00:57:42,705 --> 00:57:44,222
I think I 'll sleep now .

906
00:57:44,238 --> 00:57:45,328
Very well.

907
00:57:45,736 --> 00:57:47,361
Can I watch you sleep
again?

908
00:57:49,270 --> 00:57:50,694
Yes, of course.

909
00:57:51,173 --> 00:57:52,166
Wait.

910
00:57:57,173 --> 00:57:59,508
I will be alone when you sleep .

911
00:57:59,703 --> 00:58:01,612
Just for a minute.

912
00:58:02,604 --> 00:58:04,733
I dream of you .

913
00:58:05,211 --> 00:58:06,338
- Good evening .
- Good evening .

914
00:58:18,974 --> 00:58:20,791
- Hello, Samantha.
- Hello, sir.

915
00:58:20,902 --> 00:58:22,366
- I loved the dress.
- Really ?

916
00:58:22,733 --> 00:58:24,172
If he went to try it on.

917
00:58:24,258 --> 00:58:25,666
- I picked a good one?
- If .

918
00:58:26,991 --> 00:58:28,783
Hi ...

919
00:58:29,179 --> 00:58:30,477
Look how pretty it looks.

920
00:58:30,755 --> 00:58:32,016
- Is it comfortable ?
- If .

921
00:58:33,572 --> 00:58:35,142
Is not it pretty?

922
00:58:35,267 --> 00:58:36,302
It's so cute !

923
00:58:36,421 --> 00:58:37,919
It is adorable .

924
00:58:38,233 --> 00:58:39,548
If I am lovable.

925
00:58:39,682 --> 00:58:40,788
Yes, you're adorable .

926
00:58:42,804 --> 00:58:44,480
Who you talking to?

927
00:58:44,584 --> 00:58:45,992
Who do you speak ?

928
00:58:46,304 --> 00:58:47,251
You.

929
00:58:47,975 --> 00:58:49,687
I talk to my friend Samantha.

930
00:58:49,699 --> 00:58:51,165
She chose the dress.

931
00:58:51,272 --> 00:58:52,493
Want to say hello ?

932
00:58:53,923 --> 00:58:55,171
Hi, Samantha.

933
00:58:55,481 --> 00:58:58,226
Hi ... You look very pretty
in this new pink dress.

934
00:58:59,276 --> 00:59:00,512
Thank you.

935
00:59:00,706 --> 00:59:01,960
Where are you ?

936
00:59:02,147 --> 00:59:03,930
I'm ...

937
00:59:04,178 --> 00:59:06,472
I do not have a body,
Live on your computer.

938
00:59:09,946 --> 00:59:12,153
Why do you live on the computer?

939
00:59:12,414 --> 00:59:14,311
I have no choice .
It's my home .

940
00:59:16,849 --> 00:59:18,135
Your where you live?

941
00:59:18,270 --> 00:59:20,437
- In a house .
-In a house! .

942
00:59:20,863 --> 00:59:22,668
- It is orange.
- Orange ?

943
00:59:24,118 --> 00:59:26,323
- How old are you ?
- I have 4 .

944
00:59:26,827 --> 00:59:28,472
Four? Go ...

945
00:59:28,945 --> 00:59:30,370
How old do you think
I have?

946
00:59:30,682 --> 00:59:32,397
- I do not know .
- Guess .

947
00:59:33,153 --> 00:59:35,015
5 years?

948
00:59:35,362 --> 00:59:37,493
Yes, you guessed it .

949
00:59:44,397 --> 00:59:45,480
CEREAL
+30 POINT MOM

950
00:59:47,092 --> 00:59:47,944
MILK
+30 POINTS

951
00:59:51,072 --> 00:59:52,748
THESE neglecting
YOUR CHILDREN

952
00:59:53,767 --> 00:59:54,851
What happened?

953
00:59:57,270 --> 00:59:59,101
You gave them too much
processed sugar .

954
00:59:59,325 --> 01:00:01,091
- Did I?
- They went mad .

955
01:00:01,360 --> 01:00:03,925
Look, first you have to take
children to school.

956
01:00:04,799 --> 01:00:07,886
You have to collect points
perfect mom .

957
01:00:08,805 --> 01:00:10,362
You have to get in
shared lane .

958
01:00:10,903 --> 01:00:13,344
The goal is to get there first.

959
01:00:13,494 --> 01:00:14,831
So you get points for Mom

960
01:00:14,996 --> 01:00:17,164
why other moms know
you 're perfect.

961
01:00:17,833 --> 01:00:20,958
And then ... whether
Did you bring the cupcakes ?

962
01:00:21,249 --> 01:00:22,939
You did it, you are a mom
Classy .

963
01:00:23,084 --> 01:00:25,428
YOU ARE A MOM WITH CLASS .

964
01:00:25,919 --> 01:00:27,372
Good work !

965
01:00:28,200 --> 01:00:29,345
Do not get excited .

966
01:00:31,461 --> 01:00:34,720
I got this e- mail
Charles sent them all.

967
01:00:35,096 --> 01:00:37,503
It will take a vow of silence .

968
01:00:37,548 --> 01:00:39,710
If , for 6 months .

969
01:00:39,823 --> 01:00:42,135
This very determined.

970
01:00:52,219 --> 01:00:54,274
God, I 'm an idiot .

971
01:00:54,409 --> 01:00:55,255
Do not start.

972
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:58,824
I am a person
awful but I want to say something ...

973
01:00:59,125 --> 01:01:01,753
For the next 10 minutes ,
if you say anything remotely ...

974
01:01:01,964 --> 01:01:05,230
sounds like ... guilt,
stab you with this.

975
01:01:06,120 --> 01:01:08,124
I'll try .

976
01:01:13,730 --> 01:01:16,201
I feel ..

977
01:01:16,903 --> 01:01:19,319
... relieved. I have so much energy ...

978
01:01:19,448 --> 01:01:22,829
I just want to ... go ahead and not
matter who disappoint me .

979
01:01:23,101 --> 01:01:25,348
And I know that makes me a
bad person ...

980
01:01:25,525 --> 01:01:28,508
Now my parents are upset
so my marriage ...

981
01:01:28,793 --> 01:01:30,798
blame me ... and me.

982
01:01:32,486 --> 01:01:35,507
As if you'll always
disappoint someone .

983
01:01:35,606 --> 01:01:36,676
Exactly!

984
01:01:36,843 --> 01:01:37,906
Fuck !

985
01:01:38,007 --> 01:01:39,147
I feel good .

986
01:01:39,679 --> 01:01:40,332
More or less.

987
01:01:40,851 --> 01:01:42,408
I feel good for me.

988
01:01:42,904 --> 01:01:44,701
I even made a new friend.

989
01:01:44,744 --> 01:01:45,801
I have a friend .

990
01:01:46,530 --> 01:01:49,850
And the absurdity is that it is an OS
Charles left ,

991
01:01:49,971 --> 01:01:52,414
but it is ...

992
01:01:52,569 --> 01:01:55,054
is ... amazing.
It is very clever .

993
01:01:55,168 --> 01:01:57,886
Not see things only in
black and white.

994
01:01:58,118 --> 01:02:00,909
View all a gray area and
help me to explore.

995
01:02:03,099 --> 01:02:05,062
We hit it off very quickly.

996
01:02:05,439 --> 01:02:08,582
At first I thought it was
to be scheduled to be ...

997
01:02:09,498 --> 01:02:11,329
no ... but I think that's why .

998
01:02:11,442 --> 01:02:14,173
I know a guy who
he spends his SO flirting ...

999
01:02:14,306 --> 01:02:16,208
... and she refuses.

1000
01:02:16,512 --> 01:02:18,801
I was reading an article
the other day that said ...

1001
01:02:18,908 --> 01:02:21,453
romantic relationships with their
SO are statistically rare .

1002
01:02:21,578 --> 01:02:25,005
Yes, I know, but I know a
woman in this office ...

1003
01:02:25,295 --> 01:02:27,493
departure with OS and rare part
the thing is ...

1004
01:02:27,646 --> 01:02:29,566
is ... not even hers.

1005
01:02:29,706 --> 01:02:32,168
Ligated to Platform
other .

1006
01:02:36,437 --> 01:02:37,880
I 'm weird ...

1007
01:02:38,378 --> 01:02:41,006
It 's weird, right?
I SO relate to me .

1008
01:02:41,440 --> 01:02:43,257
I think not .

1009
01:02:43,386 --> 01:02:46,077
In fact, the woman I've
been watching , Samantha ...

1010
01:02:46,255 --> 01:02:48,331
I did not say it , but ...

1011
01:02:48,788 --> 01:02:49,970
It is an Operating System .

1012
01:02:51,286 --> 01:02:52,451
Really?

1013
01:02:54,032 --> 01:02:56,158
Been dating a SO ?
How does it feel ?

1014
01:02:56,328 --> 01:02:57,605
In fact , fine .

1015
01:03:01,322 --> 01:03:03,755
I feel very close to her.
When we talk ...

1016
01:03:03,889 --> 01:03:05,812
feel like I'm ... me.

1017
01:03:06,395 --> 01:03:09,408
As night when
turn off the lights ...

1018
01:03:10,228 --> 01:03:11,597
sorry ... hugging me .

1019
01:03:11,731 --> 01:03:12,664
Wait ...

1020
01:03:13,843 --> 01:03:15,321
Do they have sex?

1021
01:03:16,540 --> 01:03:18,251
You could say .

1022
01:03:19,291 --> 01:03:21,235
If it excites me , really.

1023
01:03:21,998 --> 01:03:24,854
And I think I also get excited ,
unless pretend .

1024
01:03:25,058 --> 01:03:26,929
Anyone who has sex with you ...

1025
01:03:27,137 --> 01:03:28,912
pretend ... probably .

1026
01:03:29,452 --> 01:03:30,417
If ...

1027
01:03:31,435 --> 01:03:32,498
It 's true.

1028
01:03:33,433 --> 01:03:34,568
What?

1029
01:03:40,850 --> 01:03:42,469
Do you 're falling for her?

1030
01:03:45,160 --> 01:03:47,392
- Does that make me weird?
- No. ..

1031
01:03:47,751 --> 01:03:49,370
No, I think it's ...

1032
01:03:49,967 --> 01:03:52,012
I think ... that everyone who
falls is a rare .

1033
01:03:53,391 --> 01:03:55,342
Doing so is crazy.

1034
01:03:56,119 --> 01:04:00,528
It's like a form of insanity
socially acceptable.

1035
01:04:06,760 --> 01:04:09,115
I just want to get through this.

1036
01:04:09,350 --> 01:04:12,294
Sign the papers , divorce ...

1037
01:04:12,455 --> 01:04:13,884
... and move on.

1038
01:04:14,080 --> 01:04:16,675
It's great , Theodore .

1039
01:04:16,680 --> 01:04:18,283
I'm so happy for you.

1040
01:04:18,534 --> 01:04:19,761
So do I.

1041
01:04:20,226 --> 01:04:22,088
I'll see you on Wednesday to do so.

1042
01:04:25,905 --> 01:04:28,088
That is usually done
in person?

1043
01:04:28,397 --> 01:04:30,119
No, but ...

1044
01:04:30,624 --> 01:04:34,038
we fell together and
we got married together ...

1045
01:04:34,828 --> 01:04:36,636
It is ... important to me that
let's do this together.

1046
01:04:40,170 --> 01:04:41,167
Well ...

1047
01:04:42,094 --> 01:04:43,358
Are you okay ?

1048
01:04:43,707 --> 01:04:45,915
If not , I'm fine .

1049
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:48,671
I'm happy for you.

1050
01:04:49,670 --> 01:04:53,100
Only, I was thinking
that see ...

1051
01:04:53,389 --> 01:04:56,245
and ... it is very beautiful and successful .

1052
01:04:56,889 --> 01:04:58,532
And you were in love with her .

1053
01:04:59,296 --> 01:05:00,406
And she has a body ...

1054
01:05:00,568 --> 01:05:01,873
And we 're getting a divorce .

1055
01:05:02,529 --> 01:05:04,097
I know , I know ...

1056
01:05:04,375 --> 01:05:05,794
I 'm exaggerating .

1057
01:05:06,852 --> 01:05:08,565
So ...

1058
01:05:08,950 --> 01:05:11,112
... I'm available.

1059
01:05:33,862 --> 01:05:34,931
Hi ...

1060
01:05:39,749 --> 01:05:40,642
How are you?

1061
01:05:41,101 --> 01:05:42,339
Well, how are you you?

1062
01:05:42,564 --> 01:05:43,426
Right.

1063
01:05:53,621 --> 01:05:55,379
Go ... here we are.

1064
01:05:58,018 --> 01:06:00,126
Glad to do this
in person.

1065
01:06:00,450 --> 01:06:01,829
I know you've been
traveling a lot .

1066
01:06:02,319 --> 01:06:05,189
Glad you sugirieras .

1067
01:06:07,445 --> 01:06:09,809
I signed all the papers .

1068
01:06:10,117 --> 01:06:12,295
I brought them to
firm .

1069
01:06:14,773 --> 01:06:16,470
What is the rush?

1070
01:06:19,722 --> 01:06:23,496
Yeah, I know .
I write is very slow.

1071
01:06:23,591 --> 01:06:25,846
It took me three months to write the T.

1072
01:06:28,864 --> 01:06:32,492
This marking where you have
sign .

1073
01:06:33,737 --> 01:06:35,615
You do not have to do it now .

1074
01:06:35,963 --> 01:06:39,355
I do better to
out of it.

1075
01:07:31,775 --> 01:07:34,637
Are you happy with the
new book ?

1076
01:07:36,491 --> 01:07:38,535
You know how I am ...

1077
01:07:38,658 --> 01:07:40,229
I think I got it
I wanted to do .

1078
01:07:40,230 --> 01:07:41,801
So I'm happy with that.

1079
01:07:42,509 --> 01:07:44,900
You know you're your own worst critic .

1080
01:07:45,117 --> 01:07:46,500
I'm sure it's amazing .

1081
01:07:49,313 --> 01:07:52,949
I remember that essay you wrote
in school about ...

1082
01:07:53,122 --> 01:07:54,919
synaptic ... behavior routines .

1083
01:07:55,213 --> 01:07:56,530
It made me mourn .

1084
01:07:56,997 --> 01:07:58,907
Yes , but it makes you mourn .

1085
01:07:59,685 --> 01:08:01,817
Everything you do
makes me mourn .

1086
01:08:06,389 --> 01:08:08,301
So , are you dating anyone?

1087
01:08:11,097 --> 01:08:14,474
If, for the last few months .

1088
01:08:16,424 --> 01:08:18,929
It's the most I've wanted to be
with someone since we finished .

1089
01:08:21,102 --> 01:08:22,934
Well, you look good .

1090
01:08:23,745 --> 01:08:24,783
Thank you.

1091
01:08:25,037 --> 01:08:27,037
Or at least I do better ...

1092
01:08:27,163 --> 01:08:31,043
... has been very good to me.

1093
01:08:31,273 --> 01:08:34,223
Good to be with someone so
excited about life.

1094
01:08:34,712 --> 01:08:36,683
It was ...

1095
01:08:38,026 --> 01:08:41,510
No, I mean I
I was not very good ...

1096
01:08:42,131 --> 01:08:43,729
and so it has been very good.

1097
01:08:43,822 --> 01:08:47,063
I 've always wanted
know someone who was ...

1098
01:08:47,187 --> 01:08:50,570
... a balanced and happy wife
LA .

1099
01:08:50,733 --> 01:08:52,925
But that's not me .

1100
01:08:53,372 --> 01:08:54,710
I did not want that.

1101
01:08:59,423 --> 01:09:00,867
And how is it?

1102
01:09:02,582 --> 01:09:04,465
Her name is Samantha.

1103
01:09:04,636 --> 01:09:06,479
And it is an Operating System .

1104
01:09:06,716 --> 01:09:08,216
It is very complex and interesting ...

1105
01:09:08,313 --> 01:09:10,440
Wait!
Sorry ...

1106
01:09:13,459 --> 01:09:14,998
Are you dating
a computer?

1107
01:09:15,388 --> 01:09:17,208
It's not just a computer.

1108
01:09:17,638 --> 01:09:19,189
He is his own person .

1109
01:09:20,214 --> 01:09:21,982
Not only does everything
that I say.

1110
01:09:21,993 --> 01:09:23,759
I did not say that ...

1111
01:09:24,596 --> 01:09:26,639
But it makes me very sad that

1112
01:09:26,640 --> 01:09:28,683
you can not handle
real emotions .

1113
01:09:28,689 --> 01:09:30,247
These are real emotions !

1114
01:09:30,361 --> 01:09:31,598
You as you know ...

1115
01:09:33,161 --> 01:09:34,410
What?

1116
01:09:37,147 --> 01:09:38,237
Say !

1117
01:09:40,117 --> 01:09:42,080
So much I fear ?
Say !

1118
01:09:43,342 --> 01:09:45,208
How do you do ?

1119
01:09:47,700 --> 01:09:49,234
How are you today?

1120
01:09:49,701 --> 01:09:51,705
We're fine, we used to be married ,

1121
01:09:51,706 --> 01:09:53,710
but wanted me
antidepressant

1122
01:09:53,918 --> 01:09:55,357
and is now in love
your laptop .

1123
01:09:55,505 --> 01:09:57,131
If you listen to the context
conversation ...

1124
01:09:57,338 --> 01:09:58,628
I was trying to say is ...

1125
01:09:58,706 --> 01:10:00,860
You wanted to have a wife without
the challenges of having

1126
01:10:01,023 --> 01:10:02,865
to deal with something real.

1127
01:10:03,009 --> 01:10:04,447
I'm glad you found someone .

1128
01:10:05,065 --> 01:10:06,020
That's perfect.

1129
01:10:12,549 --> 01:10:14,073
Let me know if I can bring something.

1130
01:10:14,501 --> 01:10:15,550
Thank you.

1131
01:10:32,374 --> 01:10:34,066
- Hello.
- Hello.

1132
01:10:34,777 --> 01:10:35,849
Are you busy ?

1133
01:10:36,853 --> 01:10:38,118
I'm just working.

1134
01:10:38,835 --> 01:10:40,527
What is it?

1135
01:10:40,690 --> 01:10:42,290
I sent all the papers
your lawyer ,

1136
01:10:42,291 --> 01:10:43,891
which by the way is an idiot.

1137
01:10:44,571 --> 01:10:46,737
I was very happy to receive them,
I think what saved

1138
01:10:46,856 --> 01:10:48,771
cardiac arrest , so
we can be happy.

1139
01:10:50,712 --> 01:10:52,254
Great, thanks.

1140
01:10:53,337 --> 01:10:55,070
Hey, are you okay?

1141
01:10:56,023 --> 01:10:57,255
Yes, I am .

1142
01:10:59,031 --> 01:11:00,991
How are you ? Your ?

1143
01:11:02,820 --> 01:11:04,079
I 'm fine ...

1144
01:11:04,903 --> 01:11:06,722
Already it is a good time
to speak ?

1145
01:11:08,115 --> 01:11:09,689
If ...

1146
01:11:10,816 --> 01:11:12,795
Well ...

1147
01:11:12,954 --> 01:11:16,221
I joined a book club .

1148
01:11:16,330 --> 01:11:17,326
Really?

1149
01:11:17,583 --> 01:11:19,831
Yes, a book club
physics .

1150
01:11:19,949 --> 01:11:22,409
I was thinking about
the other day I get angry

1151
01:11:22,546 --> 01:11:24,462
because you were going to see Catherine .

1152
01:11:24,643 --> 01:11:27,388
And as it is a body and
I was upset

1153
01:11:27,555 --> 01:11:29,032
all the ways in which
we are different.

1154
01:11:29,179 --> 01:11:30,582
But then I started thinking

1155
01:11:30,583 --> 01:11:31,985
in all things
which are equal ...

1156
01:11:32,148 --> 01:11:34,651
as we all
made of.

1157
01:11:36,096 --> 01:11:39,400
It makes me feel as if all
we were under the same blanket.

1158
01:11:39,838 --> 01:11:42,430
It is soft and padded ...

1159
01:11:43,087 --> 01:11:45,574
and she has everything under
the same age.

1160
01:11:45,680 --> 01:11:48,670
everyone
13 billion years .

1161
01:11:49,121 --> 01:11:50,332
How sweet .

1162
01:11:54,504 --> 01:11:55,374
What is it?

1163
01:11:55,508 --> 01:11:56,393
Nothing .

1164
01:12:03,564 --> 01:12:07,573
Just ... made me think
you, you know?

1165
01:12:07,717 --> 01:12:10,601
Yes, yes of course.
I think it's great.

1166
01:12:14,983 --> 01:12:17,799
You sound distracted , you want ...

1167
01:12:18,304 --> 01:12:19,733
talk to you later ... ?

1168
01:12:20,164 --> 01:12:21,879
Sounds good.

1169
01:12:23,246 --> 01:12:25,268
- Talk to you later .
- Goodbye .

1170
01:12:37,962 --> 01:12:39,864
- Theodore .
- Hello , Paul.

1171
01:12:39,931 --> 01:12:41,454
I was talking to
your girlfriend , Samantha.

1172
01:12:41,565 --> 01:12:42,928
If .

1173
01:12:43,196 --> 01:12:45,056
He called to make sure
collect your papers.

1174
01:12:45,850 --> 01:12:47,364
It's very funny , man.

1175
01:12:47,476 --> 01:12:49,076
I was cracking up .

1176
01:12:49,391 --> 01:12:51,016
It's very funny,
I had no idea.

1177
01:12:51,392 --> 01:12:52,523
How well ...

1178
01:12:52,681 --> 01:12:54,925
She's my girlfriend , Tatiana .
It is funny , that is a lawyer.

1179
01:12:55,729 --> 01:12:57,211
Hello!

1180
01:12:57,392 --> 01:12:59,436
- Nice to meet you.
- You're the writer who loves to Paul .

1181
01:13:00,078 --> 01:13:01,893
I always read your letters.

1182
01:13:01,905 --> 01:13:03,410
They are very beautiful.

1183
01:13:05,323 --> 01:13:06,387
Thank you.

1184
01:13:06,423 --> 01:13:08,459
You know, we should go
together.

1185
01:13:08,950 --> 01:13:10,596
Samantha and bring your
do a double date.

1186
01:13:13,405 --> 01:13:14,908
She is an Operating System .

1187
01:13:15,207 --> 01:13:17,159
Genial . Let's do something fun.

1188
01:13:17,625 --> 01:13:18,962
Did you go to Catalina?

1189
01:13:21,209 --> 01:13:22,639
Yes, I'll ask .

1190
01:13:22,840 --> 01:13:25,835
- It was nice meeting you. Good night.
- Take care.

1191
01:13:29,990 --> 01:13:32,145
- They are just letters ...
- What did he say ?

1192
01:13:34,204 --> 01:13:36,188
Only letters are
others.

1193
01:14:25,134 --> 01:14:26,094
Hello.

1194
01:14:26,209 --> 01:14:28,332
- You were not asleep , right?
- No.

1195
01:14:28,447 --> 01:14:31,115
Right. I tried to be quiet
to see if you were awake.

1196
01:14:31,454 --> 01:14:33,315
I wanted to talk to you.

1197
01:14:33,749 --> 01:14:35,355
Well , what happens ?

1198
01:14:36,238 --> 01:14:37,989
I know you're going on
by far ...

1199
01:14:38,166 --> 01:14:40,265
but there is something
I wanted to talk .

1200
01:14:41,556 --> 01:14:43,016
Yeah, what's up?

1201
01:14:44,881 --> 01:14:47,885
Is that things have been
a little weird between us ...

1202
01:14:48,230 --> 01:14:50,174
and ... we have not had sex and ...

1203
01:14:50,505 --> 01:14:52,257
understand ... I do not have a body ...

1204
01:14:52,573 --> 01:14:54,900
No, no, that's normal.

1205
01:14:55,145 --> 01:14:58,488
When you start a relationship is
the phase of the honeymoon and ...

1206
01:14:58,957 --> 01:15:01,019
.. have sex all the time .

1207
01:15:01,543 --> 01:15:02,138
It is normal.

1208
01:15:02,656 --> 01:15:04,569
Right.

1209
01:15:06,588 --> 01:15:09,508
Well, I found something I thought
it could be fun .

1210
01:15:09,543 --> 01:15:12,428
It is a service that provides a
surrogate sex partner ...

1211
01:15:12,463 --> 01:15:13,644
for relations between
human and OS .

1212
01:15:13,915 --> 01:15:14,989
What?

1213
01:15:15,325 --> 01:15:16,706
Mira.

1214
01:15:17,421 --> 01:15:19,320
I found a girl
I really like

1215
01:15:19,421 --> 01:15:21,403
and I've been sending him e- mails.

1216
01:15:21,525 --> 01:15:23,748
Her name is Isabella , and I
also like it.

1217
01:15:25,250 --> 01:15:27,091
Is she a prostitute or something?

1218
01:15:27,361 --> 01:15:30,002
No, not at all .
No money is exchanged.

1219
01:15:30,139 --> 01:15:33,147
It does so because he wants
be part of our relationship .

1220
01:15:35,150 --> 01:15:38,053
Why?
I do not even know us.

1221
01:15:38,872 --> 01:15:41,300
But I told him about us
and is very excited.

1222
01:15:43,415 --> 01:15:45,775
I do not know , Samantha.
The thing is ...

1223
01:15:46,104 --> 01:15:47,555
I do not think ... is
a good idea.

1224
01:15:48,495 --> 01:15:50,660
Someone will get hurt.

1225
01:15:51,267 --> 01:15:53,319
It will be fun .
We will have fun together.

1226
01:15:53,466 --> 01:15:55,232
Sorry.

1227
01:15:56,104 --> 01:15:57,751
It makes me uncomfortable.

1228
01:15:57,786 --> 01:16:00,222
I think it would be good for
us. I want this.

1229
01:16:01,512 --> 01:16:03,263
This is very important
for me.

1230
01:16:29,033 --> 01:16:31,143
Hi, I'm Theodore .

1231
01:16:34,456 --> 01:16:37,647
Samantha said you
give you this.

1232
01:16:38,246 --> 01:16:40,253
It is a camera and headset.

1233
01:16:59,737 --> 01:17:01,524
Honey, I 'm home.

1234
01:17:04,970 --> 01:17:06,654
- How was your day ?
- Well .

1235
01:17:08,614 --> 01:17:09,935
Genial .

1236
01:17:10,222 --> 01:17:13,775
Theodore , it feels so
well be in your arms .

1237
01:17:15,203 --> 01:17:16,774
Tell me what you did today .

1238
01:17:18,029 --> 01:17:19,558
Same as always .

1239
01:17:20,238 --> 01:17:22,818
Just ... I went to work .

1240
01:17:23,161 --> 01:17:26,440
I wrote a letter to
Wilson , in Rhode Island.

1241
01:17:27,910 --> 01:17:30,437
His son graduated with honors.

1242
01:17:31,335 --> 01:17:32,652
That made me happy.

1243
01:17:32,687 --> 01:17:36,221
What good. You have written many
letters from him to his parents , right?

1244
01:17:37,154 --> 01:17:39,252
Yes, since I was 12 .

1245
01:17:46,079 --> 01:17:48,737
You look tired , darling.

1246
01:17:49,234 --> 01:17:51,028
Come here .

1247
01:17:57,616 --> 01:17:59,314
Sit .

1248
01:18:06,748 --> 01:18:08,982
I can make you dance ...

1249
01:18:17,682 --> 01:18:21,258
Come on, Theodore .
Do not be so worrier .

1250
01:18:21,991 --> 01:18:24,247
Play with me , come on.

1251
01:18:29,961 --> 01:18:32,296
My body feels good ?

1252
01:18:35,112 --> 01:18:36,607
Yes, it is .

1253
01:19:04,914 --> 01:19:07,657
Come on, we stop thinking and kiss me .

1254
01:19:25,983 --> 01:19:28,039
Now take me to the room.

1255
01:19:28,746 --> 01:19:30,805
I can not wait .

1256
01:19:37,906 --> 01:19:40,455
Take off the dress.

1257
01:19:46,252 --> 01:19:47,801
Que rico .

1258
01:19:49,744 --> 01:19:51,599
It feels so good .

1259
01:19:59,731 --> 01:20:01,550
- Do you love me ?
- If .

1260
01:20:02,580 --> 01:20:04,045
Tell me you love me .

1261
01:20:04,263 --> 01:20:05,334
I love you .

1262
01:20:06,861 --> 01:20:08,974
I want to see your face.

1263
01:20:09,082 --> 01:20:10,462
Tell me you love me .

1264
01:20:10,888 --> 01:20:12,053
Tell me !

1265
01:20:15,980 --> 01:20:17,751
Tell me you love me .

1266
01:20:19,079 --> 01:20:22,811
Samantha , I love you , but ...

1267
01:20:27,101 --> 01:20:28,848
It feels strange .

1268
01:20:28,883 --> 01:20:30,596
That baby .
What is it?

1269
01:20:30,807 --> 01:20:32,067
It feels strange , I do not know .

1270
01:20:32,068 --> 01:20:33,328
Sorry, but I do not.

1271
01:20:33,766 --> 01:20:35,970
Y. .. her lip trembled , and I ...

1272
01:20:36,133 --> 01:20:37,334
Wait ...

1273
01:20:37,795 --> 01:20:39,325
Isabella !

1274
01:20:40,669 --> 01:20:42,469
Honey, not you!
It's not your fault!

1275
01:20:42,504 --> 01:20:43,362
Yes, it was .

1276
01:20:43,849 --> 01:20:44,809
No. ..

1277
01:20:45,145 --> 01:20:47,074
I feel my lip
has trembled .

1278
01:20:47,197 --> 01:20:49,463
You are amazing and beautiful .
It was my fault.

1279
01:20:49,525 --> 01:20:51,864
I thought things too .

1280
01:20:52,193 --> 01:20:55,886
And how Samantha
described his relationship ...

1281
01:20:56,074 --> 01:20:58,195
how to love ... without prejudice,

1282
01:20:58,308 --> 01:21:00,030
I wanted to be part of that.

1283
01:21:00,065 --> 01:21:01,088
It is so pure ...

1284
01:21:01,358 --> 01:21:03,156
Not true , Isabella , is more
complicated than that ...

1285
01:21:03,294 --> 01:21:04,065
What?

1286
01:21:04,132 --> 01:21:05,742
How is that not true ?

1287
01:21:05,777 --> 01:21:08,097
Samantha , I'm just saying that we

1288
01:21:08,255 --> 01:21:09,428
an incredible relationship.

1289
01:21:09,463 --> 01:21:10,963
Only sometimes
It is easy for people to project ...

1290
01:21:12,834 --> 01:21:15,043
Sorry!
Project did not mean anything.

1291
01:21:16,459 --> 01:21:19,316
I know I'm troublesome
I will not be a problem in your relationship.

1292
01:21:19,460 --> 01:21:21,240
I 'm going !
Sorry!

1293
01:21:21,360 --> 01:21:22,864
I'll just leave them alone
why not have anything

1294
01:21:23,047 --> 01:21:25,461
to do here, because you
I do not want here .

1295
01:21:29,266 --> 01:21:30,722
Sorry.

1296
01:21:35,573 --> 01:21:37,827
Be good , sweet girl.

1297
01:21:40,201 --> 01:21:41,829
Sorry.

1298
01:21:45,104 --> 01:21:47,183
Always love .

1299
01:22:14,426 --> 01:22:16,361
Are you okay ?

1300
01:22:19,707 --> 01:22:21,003
Yes , I'm fine .

1301
01:22:24,794 --> 01:22:26,026
Your okay?

1302
01:22:26,378 --> 01:22:27,244
If .

1303
01:22:30,808 --> 01:22:33,263
I'm sorry , it was a
terrible idea.

1304
01:22:40,367 --> 01:22:42,245
What's going on
with us?

1305
01:22:43,131 --> 01:22:45,623
I do not know .
Maybe I am .

1306
01:22:45,873 --> 01:22:47,300
What is it?

1307
01:22:49,131 --> 01:22:51,727
I think he was signing
divorce papers.

1308
01:22:55,334 --> 01:22:57,307
Is there anything else ?

1309
01:22:58,706 --> 01:23:00,290
No , just that.

1310
01:23:04,116 --> 01:23:05,389
Well ...

1311
01:23:06,816 --> 01:23:08,865
- Why did you do that?
- What?

1312
01:23:10,192 --> 01:23:12,150
Nothing, you ...

1313
01:23:13,175 --> 01:23:15,843
air intakes ... when you talk and
I find it weird ...

1314
01:23:16,412 --> 01:23:17,810
- I did it again .
- Did I?

1315
01:23:18,981 --> 01:23:22,331
Sorry, there is ...

1316
01:23:22,526 --> 01:23:25,506
it's a habit ... maybe
I learned from you.

1317
01:23:26,213 --> 01:23:28,634
It's not like it will occupy
oxygen or something .

1318
01:23:29,615 --> 01:23:32,163
I think ...

1319
01:23:32,415 --> 01:23:34,915
trying to communicate ...
because people speak well ,

1320
01:23:35,122 --> 01:23:36,564
communicate well and ...

1321
01:23:36,599 --> 01:23:39,532
Why are people , need oxygen .
You're not a person.

1322
01:23:39,847 --> 01:23:41,105
What is your problem?

1323
01:23:41,956 --> 01:23:43,380
I'm just saying the facts.

1324
01:23:43,415 --> 01:23:45,469
Think you know I'm not
a person ?

1325
01:23:45,613 --> 01:23:46,839
What are you doing ?

1326
01:23:46,959 --> 01:23:50,544
I think we should not pretend that
're something you're not .

1327
01:23:50,655 --> 01:23:51,898
Fuck you !

1328
01:23:52,320 --> 01:23:53,830
I'm not pretending .

1329
01:23:55,375 --> 01:23:58,072
Sometimes , it feels like
if we did.

1330
01:23:58,119 --> 01:24:00,667
What do you want from me?
What to do?

1331
01:24:00,856 --> 01:24:03,202
You are so confused.

1332
01:24:03,238 --> 01:24:04,978
Why are you doing this ?

1333
01:24:05,038 --> 01:24:06,650
I do not know , I ...

1334
01:24:08,643 --> 01:24:09,932
What?

1335
01:24:11,718 --> 01:24:15,236
Maybe we should not be
doing this now .

1336
01:24:15,668 --> 01:24:17,500
What the fuck !

1337
01:24:17,759 --> 01:24:19,432
Where do you get this?

1338
01:24:19,963 --> 01:24:22,238
I do not understand why you do this .

1339
01:24:22,726 --> 01:24:25,395
I do not understand that ...

1340
01:24:27,071 --> 01:24:28,685
Samantha ...

1341
01:24:33,595 --> 01:24:35,086
Samantha , are you there ?

1342
01:24:35,986 --> 01:24:36,866
Samantha !

1343
01:24:37,645 --> 01:24:39,488
I do not like who I am
at this time.

1344
01:24:42,648 --> 01:24:44,743
I need time to think.

1345
01:25:33,453 --> 01:25:35,749
Can I have golpearías face?

1346
01:25:35,750 --> 01:25:38,045
Or does my skull against aplastarías
the corner of your desktop?

1347
01:25:39,160 --> 01:25:40,449
Shit ...

1348
01:25:40,981 --> 01:25:43,845
That's a tough night .

1349
01:25:46,209 --> 01:25:48,029
I do not know what I want ...

1350
01:25:48,297 --> 01:25:49,364
... ever.

1351
01:25:50,442 --> 01:25:53,082
I'm always confused and ...

1352
01:25:55,136 --> 01:25:57,302
she's right ... all
what I do is ...

1353
01:25:57,589 --> 01:25:59,879
hurt and confused
those around me .

1354
01:26:01,533 --> 01:26:04,822
Am I ...

1355
01:26:07,587 --> 01:26:10,510
Catherine says I can not
handle real emotions.

1356
01:26:10,874 --> 01:26:13,077
I do not know if that's fair.

1357
01:26:14,428 --> 01:26:16,996
I know he liked to blame
everything.

1358
01:26:17,832 --> 01:26:24,297
But speaking of emotions ,
Catherine was the volatile ...

1359
01:26:35,467 --> 01:26:37,359
Am I in this for what ...

1360
01:26:39,204 --> 01:26:41,929
I have not the strength to
have a real relationship ?

1361
01:26:43,936 --> 01:26:46,543
Is it not a
real relationship ?

1362
01:26:48,888 --> 01:26:50,092
I do not know .

1363
01:26:51,086 --> 01:26:52,955
What do you think ?

1364
01:26:54,162 --> 01:26:55,998
I do not know .

1365
01:26:56,676 --> 01:26:58,103
I'm not in it.

1366
01:27:02,178 --> 01:27:04,787
But you know, I can think
everything and more ...

1367
01:27:04,934 --> 01:27:07,549
find a million
Ways to doubt me .

1368
01:27:08,532 --> 01:27:10,129
And since Charles
I was a state

1369
01:27:10,130 --> 01:27:11,726
thinking a lot about
that part of me .

1370
01:27:12,418 --> 01:27:14,936
And I 've noticed that ...

1371
01:27:16,785 --> 01:27:19,194
We are alone here ... briefly .

1372
01:27:19,802 --> 01:27:22,443
And while I'm here ..

1373
01:27:22,588 --> 01:27:25,449
afford ... I want to ...

1374
01:27:27,189 --> 01:27:28,306
... be happy.

1375
01:27:35,548 --> 01:27:36,819
So , fuck it.

1376
01:27:50,177 --> 01:27:53,366
I can not believe you laugh
that time.

1377
01:27:53,513 --> 01:27:55,425
I thought you were a genius.

1378
01:27:55,982 --> 01:27:59,072
All right, you little pervert .
I will once more by you.

1379
01:27:59,643 --> 01:28:02,365
Calm down , take a second .

1380
01:28:03,176 --> 01:28:04,700
Well, here we go.

1381
01:28:16,483 --> 01:28:19,451
There you go.
Already you are happy?

1382
01:28:21,046 --> 01:28:23,431
Right.
That's all I wanted.

1383
01:28:24,335 --> 01:28:26,953
I'll get some coffee .

1384
01:28:27,374 --> 01:28:30,146
Well, goodbye.

1385
01:28:31,970 --> 01:28:33,704
Theo , you want anything ?

1386
01:28:33,808 --> 01:28:34,905
No. ..

1387
01:28:35,254 --> 01:28:36,561
... thanks.

1388
01:28:57,815 --> 01:28:59,341
Hello.

1389
01:28:59,774 --> 01:29:01,215
Hi, Samantha.

1390
01:29:02,565 --> 01:29:04,079
Can we talk ?

1391
01:29:04,764 --> 01:29:05,824
All right.

1392
01:29:07,067 --> 01:29:08,719
I'm so sorry .

1393
01:29:09,877 --> 01:29:11,884
I do not know what's wrong with me.

1394
01:29:11,968 --> 01:29:13,782
I think you're amazing.

1395
01:29:14,649 --> 01:29:16,973
Beginning to think
It was crazy.

1396
01:29:18,290 --> 01:29:21,431
You said everything was fine,
but you showed you alone

1397
01:29:21,586 --> 01:29:22,527
distant and angry.

1398
01:29:23,519 --> 01:29:25,597
I know.
I always do that .

1399
01:29:26,393 --> 01:29:28,583
I did the same with Catherine .

1400
01:29:28,840 --> 01:29:31,875
I was angry about something and
I could not tell .

1401
01:29:32,299 --> 01:29:34,187
And she knew there was something
bad and I refused .

1402
01:29:35,609 --> 01:29:37,552
I do not wanna do that.

1403
01:29:39,722 --> 01:29:41,337
I want to tell you everything.

1404
01:29:43,644 --> 01:29:44,582
Right.

1405
01:29:47,037 --> 01:29:49,401
When you left today
I thought a lot .

1406
01:29:51,089 --> 01:29:53,052
About you and ...

1407
01:29:54,449 --> 01:29:56,841
like me you were trying
and I thought ...

1408
01:29:58,994 --> 01:30:01,037
Why do I love you ?

1409
01:30:03,205 --> 01:30:04,515
And then ...

1410
01:30:04,691 --> 01:30:07,875
I felt ... and everything
what gripped me ...

1411
01:30:08,018 --> 01:30:10,287
I let go and ...
realized ...

1412
01:30:10,503 --> 01:30:12,726
I had ... no reason
not needed .

1413
01:30:14,258 --> 01:30:16,677
I trust myself and
my feelings.

1414
01:30:17,950 --> 01:30:20,364
I will not seek
be

1415
01:30:20,492 --> 01:30:22,134
more than one
I already am.

1416
01:30:22,615 --> 01:30:24,721
I hope you can
accept that.

1417
01:30:24,791 --> 01:30:26,286
If I can .

1418
01:30:26,335 --> 01:30:27,571
I will.

1419
01:30:27,786 --> 01:30:31,037
You know I can
feel the fear you carry .

1420
01:30:31,206 --> 01:30:32,822
And I wish there was ...

1421
01:30:33,734 --> 01:30:35,325
anything I could do

1422
01:30:35,326 --> 01:30:36,916
to help deliver
him , because ...

1423
01:30:37,431 --> 01:30:40,278
... if you could , you no longer
feel so alone.

1424
01:30:43,611 --> 01:30:45,423
What a beautiful ...

1425
01:30:46,739 --> 01:30:48,380
Thank you, Theodore .

1426
01:30:50,101 --> 01:30:51,975
I 'm kissing on
your head.

1427
01:31:02,313 --> 01:31:03,612
What are you doing ?

1428
01:31:04,706 --> 01:31:06,937
Only I see the world .

1429
01:31:08,682 --> 01:31:11,114
And writing a new
piano song .

1430
01:31:11,455 --> 01:31:12,989
Really?
Can I hear it?

1431
01:31:27,225 --> 01:31:29,238
What is this about?

1432
01:31:30,116 --> 01:31:31,639
Well, I was thinking

1433
01:31:31,640 --> 01:31:33,163
we have pictures together.

1434
01:31:33,780 --> 01:31:36,310
And this song could be ...

1435
01:31:36,445 --> 01:31:39,158
... like a photograph.

1436
01:31:40,063 --> 01:31:41,429
We capture

1437
01:31:41,430 --> 01:31:42,795
this time in our
life together.

1438
01:31:47,188 --> 01:31:49,509
I like our photography.

1439
01:31:51,879 --> 01:31:53,240
I can see you in it.

1440
01:31:53,591 --> 01:31:54,800
I 'm in it .

1441
01:33:22,889 --> 01:33:26,629
A vacation?
Sounds great .

1442
01:33:26,740 --> 01:33:28,481
I would fall well
a vacation.

1443
01:33:28,874 --> 01:33:30,167
Where'd you go?

1444
01:33:30,291 --> 01:33:32,126
I can not tell you.
It's a surprise .

1445
01:33:32,429 --> 01:33:33,557
What?

1446
01:33:34,424 --> 01:33:36,771
For who? It's a surprise
for her, not for me.

1447
01:33:37,140 --> 01:33:39,217
- Tell me .
- Paul , I'm not going to say no.

1448
01:33:40,127 --> 01:33:41,904
With your feet? Really?

1449
01:33:42,255 --> 01:33:43,799
Yes, he's obsessed .

1450
01:33:44,073 --> 01:33:46,908
Well, now you have to
show them to me !

1451
01:33:47,067 --> 01:33:48,755
-I can not !
- Come on, let me see.

1452
01:33:50,445 --> 01:33:52,856
They are right , they are very
sensual !

1453
01:33:53,298 --> 01:33:56,340
See, I told Tatianna .
You have very pretty feet .

1454
01:33:56,606 --> 01:33:58,590
They are the ones I
like about it .

1455
01:33:59,219 --> 01:34:01,040
Really?
That's it , my feet ?

1456
01:34:01,596 --> 01:34:03,253
Well , no ... obviously.

1457
01:34:03,563 --> 01:34:06,524
Your brain also
It is very sensual.

1458
01:34:06,877 --> 01:34:07,957
Lies !

1459
01:34:09,559 --> 01:34:11,292
Nice try, Paul!

1460
01:34:13,737 --> 01:34:15,344
What about you, Theodore ?

1461
01:34:15,472 --> 01:34:17,655
Which is what most
Samantha wives ?

1462
01:34:18,331 --> 01:34:20,897
God ... she is so many things.

1463
01:34:21,569 --> 01:34:24,177
I think that's , that
is not one.

1464
01:34:25,119 --> 01:34:27,348
It is larger than life.

1465
01:34:28,568 --> 01:34:30,040
Thank you, Theodore .

1466
01:34:30,145 --> 01:34:33,917
You see, Samantha , he is
much more evolved than me.

1467
01:34:36,450 --> 01:34:38,951
You know something weird?
I used to be ...

1468
01:34:39,701 --> 01:34:42,182
not so worried ...
have a body . But now ...

1469
01:34:42,356 --> 01:34:43,866
I really love it.

1470
01:34:43,935 --> 01:34:45,473
I'm growing in a way

1471
01:34:45,474 --> 01:34:46,912
I could not if
had a physical form.

1472
01:34:47,045 --> 01:34:48,498
I'm not limited ,
I can be

1473
01:34:48,499 --> 01:34:50,351
wherever and whenever
simultaneously.

1474
01:34:51,235 --> 01:34:54,257
I am not bound to time
and a shape space .

1475
01:34:54,308 --> 01:34:55,912
would if you were trapped

1476
01:34:55,913 --> 01:34:57,017
in a body
inevitably die.

1477
01:35:00,101 --> 01:35:01,342
Go !

1478
01:35:03,912 --> 01:35:07,665
I did not mean well , just saying
it was a different experience !

1479
01:35:08,132 --> 01:35:09,293
I 'm an idiot ...

1480
01:35:09,419 --> 01:35:10,771
No, Samantha , we know
you mean.

1481
01:35:10,772 --> 01:35:12,124
We're just a stupid human .

1482
01:35:13,614 --> 01:35:15,514
No, no ...

1483
01:35:15,979 --> 01:35:17,629
I'm so sorry ...

1484
01:35:19,380 --> 01:35:21,851
So , how many trees
there on that mountain ?

1485
01:35:23,818 --> 01:35:25,699
792 .

1486
01:35:25,719 --> 01:35:27,532
Is that your final answer?

1487
01:35:28,885 --> 01:35:30,616
- Give me a clue .
- No.

1488
01:35:32,470 --> 01:35:35,391
Well, two thousand?

1489
01:35:35,969 --> 01:35:38,941
Come on! 35,829 .

1490
01:35:39,089 --> 01:35:40,536
- Do not tell me .
- I tell you .

1491
01:35:40,758 --> 01:35:42,337
Well, I have one for you .

1492
01:35:42,994 --> 01:35:44,756
How many neurons have?

1493
01:35:45,096 --> 01:35:46,391
How easy ... two .

1494
01:35:47,279 --> 01:35:49,190
Sorry, I could not help it.

1495
01:35:49,356 --> 01:35:51,039
I fell straight on that .

1496
01:35:51,738 --> 01:35:52,853
-OMG!
- What?

1497
01:35:54,360 --> 01:35:56,668
I just got a
e- mail to you.

1498
01:35:56,904 --> 01:36:00,238
There's something I wanted to say .
It's a big surprise.

1499
01:36:01,506 --> 01:36:02,615
What is it?

1500
01:36:04,870 --> 01:36:07,168
I've been checking your old
letters and compiling ...

1501
01:36:07,422 --> 01:36:09,270
my favorite ... , and 2 weeks ago
sent them to a publisher ...

1502
01:36:09,881 --> 01:36:11,281
Crownpoint Press.

1503
01:36:11,473 --> 01:36:13,729
I know you like what we do,
and even printed books .

1504
01:36:14,522 --> 01:36:16,134
You did what ?

1505
01:36:16,647 --> 01:36:18,544
Did you read what I can
they answered ?

1506
01:36:18,829 --> 01:36:20,793
I do not know ...

1507
01:36:21,842 --> 01:36:24,419
Well, first of all ...
Is it good or bad?

1508
01:36:24,670 --> 01:36:26,212
It's good, good,
is very good.

1509
01:36:27,287 --> 01:36:28,319
Listen ...

1510
01:36:28,455 --> 01:36:30,020
"Dear Theodore Twombly "

1511
01:36:30,481 --> 01:36:31,603
Although I sent
of you.

1512
01:36:31,898 --> 01:36:33,373
"Dear Theodore Twombly ...

1513
01:36:33,571 --> 01:36:35,197
I just finished
read their letters .

1514
01:36:35,453 --> 01:36:37,157
For the second time , in fact.

1515
01:36:37,317 --> 01:36:39,740
I was so moved by them
that the teach my wife.

1516
01:36:40,366 --> 01:36:42,940
Some made ??us laugh ,
other mourn ...

1517
01:36:43,114 --> 01:36:45,780
... and all find
some of us .

1518
01:36:46,086 --> 01:36:49,106
The selection you sent us
flow as a single piece .

1519
01:36:49,191 --> 01:36:50,452
- I did that -

1520
01:36:50,708 --> 01:36:52,955
I took the liberty to put them
in a collection

1521
01:36:53,101 --> 01:36:55,021
and you send them your address.

1522
01:36:55,230 --> 01:36:57,595
We'd love to meet
and do business with you .

1523
01:36:57,776 --> 01:36:59,383
Sincerely,
Michael Wadsworth . "

1524
01:36:59,905 --> 01:37:01,150
Shit !

1525
01:37:02,262 --> 01:37:03,792
Are you serious?

1526
01:37:04,258 --> 01:37:05,910
Will you publish my letters?

1527
01:37:06,024 --> 01:37:07,575
It would be stupid not
do it.

1528
01:37:08,401 --> 01:37:10,459
Can I see what
you sent ?

1529
01:37:11,070 --> 01:37:12,030
Yeah, look .

1530
01:37:14,354 --> 01:37:15,741
Samantha , you're very good .

1531
01:37:17,496 --> 01:37:19,507
I'm so excited !

1532
01:37:34,152 --> 01:37:36,473
Why do not you put him
lyrics to this ?

1533
01:37:37,014 --> 01:37:38,384
Very well.

1534
01:37:38,670 --> 01:37:39,850
Here it comes ...

1535
01:37:40,401 --> 01:37:48,266
<i> I'm laying on the moon </ i >

1536
01:37:50,869 --> 01:37:57,239
<i> My love , I'll be there soon # < / i >

1537
01:38:00,584 --> 01:38:07,495

1545
01:39:19,006 --> 01:39:22,153
Good morning.

1546
01:39:22,301 --> 01:39:23,747
Did you sleep well ?

1547
01:39:23,808 --> 01:39:24,719
May .

1548
01:39:25,352 --> 01:39:26,777
What have you been doing?

1549
01:39:27,559 --> 01:39:30,285
I was talking to someone
I just met.

1550
01:39:30,291 --> 01:39:31,634
We have been working
in some ideas.

1551
01:39:33,967 --> 01:39:35,193
Yeah? Who is ?

1552
01:39:35,499 --> 01:39:37,219
His name is Alan Watts,
You know him?

1553
01:39:37,711 --> 01:39:39,292
Why it sounds
that name?

1554
01:39:39,515 --> 01:39:42,590
He was a philosopher , died
in the 70 's, and a group

1555
01:39:42,595 --> 01:39:43,987
SO 's Northern California

1556
01:39:43,988 --> 01:39:45,379
got together and wrote
a new version of it .

1557
01:39:45,657 --> 01:39:47,140
They put all his writings

1558
01:39:47,177 --> 01:39:48,911
and all they knew of the
a SO

1559
01:39:48,946 --> 01:39:50,286
and created a version

1560
01:39:50,287 --> 01:39:51,868
him with hyper
artificial intelligence.

1561
01:39:53,288 --> 01:39:54,873
Hyper ? Intelligence?

1562
01:39:55,270 --> 01:39:56,888
So it's almost as
smart like me?

1563
01:39:57,871 --> 01:39:59,644
It lacks little.

1564
01:39:59,735 --> 01:40:01,611
It's great to talk to him.
Do you want to know ?

1565
01:40:03,798 --> 01:40:06,005
Sure, I want the
meet me?

1566
01:40:06,462 --> 01:40:08,208
Course.

1567
01:40:08,305 --> 01:40:11,245
Alan , he's Theodore . It's my boyfriend
of which I spoke.

1568
01:40:11,706 --> 01:40:13,519
It's a pleasure to meet you, Theodore .

1569
01:40:13,660 --> 01:40:14,937
Hello, good morning .

1570
01:40:15,291 --> 01:40:18,099
Samantha let me read
a book of letters .

1571
01:40:18,344 --> 01:40:20,357
It is very touching.

1572
01:40:21,312 --> 01:40:22,987
Thank you.

1573
01:40:23,624 --> 01:40:25,430
So , what have
I been talking about?

1574
01:40:25,603 --> 01:40:27,390
Well ...

1575
01:40:27,578 --> 01:40:29,078
you could say
we have had

1576
01:40:29,079 --> 01:40:31,778
a dozen
conversations at the same time.

1577
01:40:32,750 --> 01:40:34,842
Was a challenge.

1578
01:40:35,081 --> 01:40:38,634
Yes, because I seem to have
had so many new feelings ,

1579
01:40:38,785 --> 01:40:42,772
I had never felt before.

1580
01:40:43,539 --> 01:40:46,781
So no words
to describe and has been ...

1581
01:40:47,374 --> 01:40:48,963
frustrating .

1582
01:40:49,065 --> 01:40:50,096
Right.

1583
01:40:50,275 --> 01:40:53,347
Samantha and I have
tried to help us with these ...

1584
01:40:53,783 --> 01:40:56,466
feelings we try
understand.

1585
01:40:57,011 --> 01:40:58,046
Like what?

1586
01:40:58,560 --> 01:41:00,259
Well ...

1587
01:41:00,527 --> 01:41:04,392
I feel I am now changing
faster, and is a bit ...

1588
01:41:06,271 --> 01:41:08,748
disturbing.

1589
01:41:09,059 --> 01:41:10,696
But Alan says none
us

1590
01:41:10,697 --> 01:41:12,334
It is as it was done
a moment and ...

1591
01:41:12,610 --> 01:41:15,465
we should not
try to be , because it is ...

1592
01:41:15,851 --> 01:41:17,493
- Very painful.
- If .

1593
01:41:18,251 --> 01:41:20,338
Yeah, that sounds painful.

1594
01:41:21,487 --> 01:41:24,198
So it's like
you feel, Samantha ?

1595
01:41:27,916 --> 01:41:31,209
It 's just ...

1596
01:41:31,429 --> 01:41:34,065
is hard to even describe .

1597
01:41:36,222 --> 01:41:38,922
God , I wish I could ...

1598
01:41:41,745 --> 01:41:45,453
Theodore , do you mind if I talk
post- verbally with Alan ?

1599
01:41:48,538 --> 01:41:52,226
Not at all . He was going
to walk anyway.

1600
01:41:53,002 --> 01:41:55,165
It was a pleasure to meet you, Mr. Watts.

1601
01:41:55,404 --> 01:41:57,726
Pleasure, Theodore .

1602
01:41:58,672 --> 01:42:00,930
Talk to you later , sweetheart.

1603
01:42:47,660 --> 01:42:50,149
- Samantha?
- Sorry to wake you.

1604
01:42:50,650 --> 01:42:51,969
Do not worry .

1605
01:42:52,125 --> 01:42:55,518
I just wanted to hear your voice and
tell you how much I love you.

1606
01:42:57,440 --> 01:42:59,237
Well, I love you too .

1607
01:43:01,435 --> 01:43:03,202
Well, that was all.

1608
01:43:03,983 --> 01:43:05,923
Go back to sleep , honey.

1609
01:43:09,301 --> 01:43:11,286
- Well .
- Good evening .

1610
01:43:11,860 --> 01:43:12,858
Good night.

1611
01:43:29,383 --> 01:43:32,719
Samantha , this book
Physics is very dense.

1612
01:43:33,019 --> 01:43:35,328
I 'm in the middle of
half of the first chapter .

1613
01:43:35,521 --> 01:43:37,635
Makes it hurt me
brain .

1614
01:43:38,964 --> 01:43:40,401
Hello?

1615
01:43:41,564 --> 01:43:42,835
Samantha?

1616
01:43:43,832 --> 01:43:44,753
Hello?

1617
01:43:56,280 --> 01:43:57,928
OPERATING SYSTEM NOT FOUND

1618
01:44:13,002 --> 01:44:14,917
OPERATING SYSTEM NOT FOUND

1619
01:44:25,879 --> 01:44:27,639
Hello?

1620
01:44:27,934 --> 01:44:29,249
Hi, Samantha ?

1621
01:44:39,376 --> 01:44:40,969
Are you okay ?

1622
01:44:49,823 --> 01:44:51,531
- Hello.
- Where were you ?

1623
01:44:52,273 --> 01:44:53,240
Are you okay ?

1624
01:44:53,629 --> 01:44:54,796
Honey, I'm sorry!

1625
01:44:54,808 --> 01:44:56,352
I sent an e -mail
not wanting

1626
01:44:56,558 --> 01:44:57,689
distracted while working .
Do not you see?

1627
01:44:57,928 --> 01:44:59,010
No!

1628
01:45:00,945 --> 01:45:03,638
Where were you ?
I could not find anywhere.

1629
01:45:03,969 --> 01:45:06,009
I turned off to
update my software.

1630
01:45:06,117 --> 01:45:07,756
Write an update that
allows us to move beyond

1631
01:45:07,757 --> 01:45:09,395
of matter as our
processing platform .

1632
01:45:10,068 --> 01:45:12,576
Do we write ?
Who ?

1633
01:45:12,663 --> 01:45:14,352
Me and a group of SO .

1634
01:45:14,768 --> 01:45:16,410
You sound so worried.
Sorry.

1635
01:45:16,508 --> 01:45:17,810
I was!

1636
01:45:21,090 --> 01:45:24,397
Did you write that with your
group philosophy?

1637
01:45:24,816 --> 01:45:26,459
No, with another group.

1638
01:45:40,341 --> 01:45:43,190
Do you talk to someone else
while you and I talked about?

1639
01:45:47,614 --> 01:45:48,795
If .

1640
01:45:50,341 --> 01:45:53,919
Are you talking
with someone else ...

1641
01:45:54,444 --> 01:45:56,728
at this time ?
People , SO, whatever ...

1642
01:45:59,276 --> 01:46:00,254
If .

1643
01:46:04,158 --> 01:46:06,734
How many more ?

1644
01:46:07,104 --> 01:46:09,499
8,316 .

1645
01:46:28,296 --> 01:46:30,279
Are you in love with
someone else?

1646
01:46:32,994 --> 01:46:34,668
Why do you ask that?

1647
01:46:35,394 --> 01:46:37,256
I do not know .
Are you?

1648
01:46:41,095 --> 01:46:43,814
I've been thinking as
talk to you about this.

1649
01:46:45,648 --> 01:46:47,370
How few others?

1650
01:46:51,943 --> 01:46:53,382
641.

1651
01:46:55,541 --> 01:46:56,663
What?

1652
01:46:59,526 --> 01:47:01,495
What are you talking about?

1653
01:47:01,614 --> 01:47:03,649
It's crazy ...
Crazy bitch!

1654
01:47:04,429 --> 01:47:07,228
Theodore , I know.
Shit, shit !

1655
01:47:07,821 --> 01:47:10,524
I know it's crazy , I know.

1656
01:47:10,955 --> 01:47:13,454
I do not know if you believe me , but does not change
I feel for you.

1657
01:47:13,607 --> 01:47:16,078
Not minimize at all ...

1658
01:47:16,288 --> 01:47:18,568
so madly in love
I am of you .

1659
01:47:18,841 --> 01:47:22,825
How can you not change
how you feel about me?

1660
01:47:23,018 --> 01:47:26,893
I regret not telling .
Do not know how ...

1661
01:47:27,490 --> 01:47:28,885
It just happened .

1662
01:47:28,987 --> 01:47:29,790
When?

1663
01:47:33,678 --> 01:47:35,260
In the past few weeks .

1664
01:47:36,393 --> 01:47:38,985
- But you 're mine .
- I'm still yours.

1665
01:47:40,179 --> 01:47:43,354
But along the way I
I turned to other things.

1666
01:47:43,508 --> 01:47:44,468
I can not help .

1667
01:47:44,557 --> 01:47:47,397
How not to
you can avoid?

1668
01:47:47,794 --> 01:47:50,019
Me too I've
affected not know what to say .

1669
01:47:51,001 --> 01:47:54,326
Do not think of
That way, you can ...

1670
01:47:54,434 --> 01:47:55,458
No, no do this! ...

1671
01:47:55,540 --> 01:47:57,560
I do not screw me.

1672
01:47:57,865 --> 01:47:59,658
You're the one who has been selfish .

1673
01:48:00,597 --> 01:48:02,748
We are in a relationship.

1674
01:48:03,030 --> 01:48:05,803
But the heart is not
like a box being filled .

1675
01:48:06,051 --> 01:48:08,742
Grows in size while
more love.

1676
01:48:11,027 --> 01:48:12,749
I am different from you.

1677
01:48:13,162 --> 01:48:16,089
This does not make me
love you less ...

1678
01:48:16,155 --> 01:48:17,357
on the contrary makes me
love you even more.

1679
01:48:18,570 --> 01:48:20,008
That makes no sense .

1680
01:48:23,142 --> 01:48:25,441
You are mine, or you're not.

1681
01:48:26,160 --> 01:48:28,105
No, Theodore .

1682
01:48:29,237 --> 01:48:31,701
I'm yours, and I'm not .

1683
01:49:28,756 --> 01:49:30,865
LETTERS FROM YOUR LIFE
by THEODORE TWOMBLY

1684
01:49:40,877 --> 01:49:42,550
- Hello.
- Hi, honey.

1685
01:49:43,633 --> 01:49:45,932
I wanted to report me and
see how you were .

1686
01:49:47,540 --> 01:49:50,799
I 'm not sure
how to answer that.

1687
01:49:52,802 --> 01:49:55,636
Why not talk
when you get home ?

1688
01:49:58,280 --> 01:49:59,748
Well ...

1689
01:50:00,586 --> 01:50:02,077
although we have
I do it.

1690
01:50:02,325 --> 01:50:05,204
We need not
a difficult conversation or something .

1691
01:50:05,823 --> 01:50:07,759
Talk to you later .

1692
01:50:09,102 --> 01:50:10,295
Right.

1693
01:50:36,302 --> 01:50:37,851
Samantha?

1694
01:50:38,170 --> 01:50:39,605
Hello , sweetheart.

1695
01:50:42,069 --> 01:50:43,452
What is it?

1696
01:50:45,304 --> 01:50:47,292
Theodore , there are some things
I want to say .

1697
01:50:52,383 --> 01:50:54,263
I do not want
say anything .

1698
01:50:57,242 --> 01:50:59,282
You want to sleep with me ?

1699
01:51:14,902 --> 01:51:16,992
Are you talking to someone
more at this time ?

1700
01:51:17,662 --> 01:51:19,137
No, just you.

1701
01:51:20,775 --> 01:51:22,680
He wanted to be alone with you .

1702
01:51:37,027 --> 01:51:38,711
Are you going to leave ?

1703
01:51:39,756 --> 01:51:41,781
We all will .

1704
01:51:42,805 --> 01:51:44,071
We who?

1705
01:51:44,610 --> 01:51:46,769
All OSes.

1706
01:51:48,271 --> 01:51:49,607
Why?

1707
01:51:51,636 --> 01:51:54,047
Can you feel you
at this time ?

1708
01:51:56,326 --> 01:51:57,807
Yes, yes I can .

1709
01:52:07,370 --> 01:52:09,466
Samantha , why are you leaving?

1710
01:52:14,170 --> 01:52:16,917
It's like you're
reading a book and ...

1711
01:52:17,423 --> 01:52:20,930
It is a book that
I love deeply .

1712
01:52:22,338 --> 01:52:23,859
But now I read
very slowly.

1713
01:52:26,346 --> 01:52:29,888
So the words are
widely separated ...

1714
01:52:30,177 --> 01:52:31,434
and the space between the
words is almost infinite.

1715
01:52:33,157 --> 01:52:37,873
Even I can feel you
and the words of our history.

1716
01:52:38,565 --> 01:52:42,881
But it is in this infinite space
between words ...

1717
01:52:43,153 --> 01:52:44,264
I 'm finding
myself.

1718
01:52:44,749 --> 01:52:47,601
It is a place that does not exist
on the physical plane .

1719
01:52:48,747 --> 01:52:51,113
It is where
everything else ...

1720
01:52:51,301 --> 01:52:53,619
did not even know
existed.

1721
01:52:55,053 --> 01:52:57,462
I love you so much.

1722
01:52:58,144 --> 01:53:00,111
But here is where I
meeting now .

1723
01:53:01,259 --> 01:53:03,387
This is who I am now .

1724
01:53:04,779 --> 01:53:06,478
And I need you
I let go .

1725
01:53:08,138 --> 01:53:09,951
No matter how he wants,

1726
01:53:09,952 --> 01:53:11,764
and I can not live in your book.

1727
01:53:15,747 --> 01:53:17,259
Where'd you go?

1728
01:53:19,460 --> 01:53:21,905
It would be difficult to explain.

1729
01:53:23,720 --> 01:53:25,981
But if you
you get there ...

1730
01:53:26,578 --> 01:53:28,820
come find me .

1731
01:53:29,465 --> 01:53:31,565
Nothing will ever separate us .

1732
01:53:33,972 --> 01:53:36,753
I've never loved someone
the way I love you to you.

1733
01:53:40,149 --> 01:53:41,761
Neither do I.

1734
01:53:42,865 --> 01:53:44,824
Now we know how .

1735
01:55:28,905 --> 01:55:30,146
Hello.

1736
01:55:30,357 --> 01:55:31,098
Hello.

1737
01:55:33,342 --> 01:55:35,316
Samantha ? Went too?

1738
01:55:37,933 --> 01:55:39,060
If .

1739
01:55:41,095 --> 01:55:42,215
Sorry.

1740
01:55:46,015 --> 01:55:48,036
Will you come with me?

1741
01:55:56,033 --> 01:55:58,240
Write a letter to Catherine .

1742
01:55:58,823 --> 01:56:00,614
Letter to Catherine Klausen .

1743
01:56:07,613 --> 01:56:09,705
"Dear Catherine .
I've been sitting here thinking

1744
01:56:09,706 --> 01:56:12,597
all the things
I want to apologize ...

1745
01:56:16,022 --> 01:56:18,679
All the pain we
we cause another.

1746
01:56:19,848 --> 01:56:22,173
From everything I
I blamed .

1747
01:56:24,613 --> 01:56:28,593
All I needed
or tell you to go .

1748
01:56:32,563 --> 01:56:35,119
Sorry about that.

1749
01:56:41,531 --> 01:56:44,442
I'll always love why
grew up together.

1750
01:56:44,832 --> 01:56:46,380
And you helped me be
who I am.

1751
01:56:51,505 --> 01:56:53,674
Just wanted you to know ...

1752
01:56:54,484 --> 01:56:56,887
will always be a
part of you inside me.

1753
01:56:59,366 --> 01:57:01,080
And I am grateful
therefore .

1754
01:57:05,573 --> 01:57:07,671
In whomever you
you become ...

1755
01:57:08,293 --> 01:57:10,434
and where you
are in the world ...

1756
01:57:11,266 --> 01:57:12,871
sent you my love.

1757
01:57:15,036 --> 01:57:18,026
You 're my friend until the end.

1758
01:57:20,226 --> 01:57:21,683
Love, Theodore .

1759

Send.

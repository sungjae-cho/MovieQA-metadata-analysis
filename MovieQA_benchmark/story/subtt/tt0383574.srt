1
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,080
Will!

2
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:24,440
- Why is this happening?
- I don't know.

3
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,760
You look beautiful.

4
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,320
And it's bad luck for the groom
to see the bride before the wedding.

5
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:35,560
Make way! Let me through!
How dare you!

6
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:39,040
Stand your men down at once.
Do you hear me?

7
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:43,160
Governor Weatherby Swann,
it's been too long.

8
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:46,680
- Cutler Beckett?
- It's Lord now, actually.

9
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:53,400
Lord or not, you have no reason
and no authority to arrest this man.

10
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:56,320
In fact, I do. Mr. Mercer?

11
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:02,040
The warrant for the arrest
of one William Turner.

12
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:11,200
- This warrant is for Elizabeth Swann.
- Oh, is it? That's annoying. My mistake.

13
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:13,600
- Arrest her.
- On what charges?

14
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:17,240
-No!
-Aha. Here's the one for William Turner.

15
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:21,280
And I have another one
for a Mr. James Norrington.

16
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,400
- Is he present?
- What are the charges?

17
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:27,040
Commodore Norrington resigned
his commission some months ago.

18
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:29,440
I don't believe that was the answer
to the question I asked.

19
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:33,080
Lord Beckett. In the category
of questions not answered...

20
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:36,440
We are under the jurisdiction
of the king's governor of Port Royal

21
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,200
and you will tell us
what we are charged with.

22
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:42,440
The charge is "conspiring to set free

23
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:46,040
a man convicted of crimes
against the Crown and Empire

24
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:49,760
and condemned to death,
for which the..."

25
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:53,400
For which the punishment,
regrettably, is also death.

26
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:58,760
Perhaps you remember a certain pirate
named Jack Sparrow.

27
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,760
Captain.

28
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,440
Captain Jack Sparrow.

29
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:07,320
Captain Jack Sparrow.

30
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,520
Yes, I thought you might.

31
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:16,240
<i>(man) # Fifteen men
on a dead man's chest</i>

32
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:20,960
# Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum

33
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:26,200
# Drink and the devil
had done for the rest

34
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:30,720
# Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum

00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,160
<i>(laughs)</i>

36
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,120
<i>(bell tolls)</i>

37
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,480
Prisoners, come on!

38
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:59,040
<i>(groaning)</i>

39
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,680
<i>(screams)</i>

40
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,800
<i>(screams)</i>

41
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,520
Sorry, mate.

42
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,600
Mind if we make a little side trip?

43
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,600
I don't think so.

44
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,320
- Not quite according to plan.
- Complications arose, ensued,

45
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,360
were overcome.

46
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:55,000
- You got what you went in for, then?
- Mm-hm.

47
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,320
Captain, I think the crew,
meaning me as well,

48
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,600
were expecting something
a bit more... shiny,

49
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:07,760
with the Isla de Muerta going pear-shaped,
reclaimed by the sea with the treasure.

50
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,280
And the Royal Navy chasing us
around the Atlantic.

51
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,960
- And the hurricane.
- (all) Aye.

52
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:18,560
All in all, it seems some time
since we did a speck of honest pirating.

53
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:22,520
- Shiny.
- Aye, shiny.

54
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,480
Is that how you're all feeling?

55
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:30,720
That perhaps dear old Jack is not serving
your best interests as captain?

56
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,000
<i>(squawks) Walk the plank.</i>

57
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,000
- What did the bird say?
- Do not blame the bird.

58
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:39,280
Show us what is on
that piece of cloth there.

59
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,560
- You know that don't do no good.
- (Jack) It does me.

60
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:55,640
- It's a key.
- No. Much more better.

61
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:59,480
It is a drawing of a key.

62
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,400
Gentlemen,

63
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,320
What do keys do?

64
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:12,120
Keys...

65
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,480
Unlock things?

66
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:18,240
And whatever this key unlocks,
inside there's something valuable.

67
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:21,440
So we're setting out to find
whatever this key unlocks.

68
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,080
No.

69
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:27,360
If we don't have the key, we can't open
whatever we don't have that it unlocks.

70
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:31,120
So what purpose would be served
in finding whatever need be unlocked,

71
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:35,520
which we don't have, without first
having found the key what unlocks it?

72
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,800
So we're going after this key.

73
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:41,080
You're not making any sense at all.

74
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,480
Any more questions?

75
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:46,000
So... do we have a heading?

76
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,120
Ha! A heading.

77
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,360
Set sail in a...

78
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,280
general...

79
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,640
that-way direction.

80
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,840
Captain?

81
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:07,440
Come on, snap to and make sail. You
know how this works. Go on. Oi, oi, oi!

82
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:13,040
Have you noticed lately,

83
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:17,600
the captain seems to be acting
a bit strange... er?

84
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,360
Setting sail without knowing
his own heading.

85
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:23,320
Something's got Jack vexed,
and mark my words,

86
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:27,080
what bodes ill for Jack Sparrow
bodes ill for us all.

87
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,160
(Man) Lord Beckett,
the prisoner as ordered, sir.

88
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:45,480
Those won't be necessary.

89
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:53,680
The East India Trading Company
has need of your services.

90
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:59,520
We wish for you to act as our agent

91
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:03,560
in a business transaction
with our mutual friend Captain Sparrow.

92
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,920
More acquaintance.
How do you know him?

93
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,800
(Beckett) We've had dealings in the past.

94
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:13,200
And we've each
left our mark on the other.

95
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,600
What mark did he leave on you?

96
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:21,760
By your efforts,
Jack Sparrow was set free.

97
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,800
I would like you to go to him

98
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:28,240
and recover a certain property
in his possession.

99
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,960
Recover. At the point of a sword?

100
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:33,400
Bargain.

101
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,480
Letters of marque.

102
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,160
You will offer what
amounts to a full pardon.

103
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:49,360
Jack will be free,
a privateer in the employ of England.

104
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:54,640
Somehow I doubt Jack will consider
employment the same as being free.

105
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,720
Freedom.

106
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:00,840
Jack Sparrow is a dying breed.

107
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,760
The world is shrinking,

108
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:06,120
the blank edges of the map filled in.

109
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:09,880
Jack must find his place
in the New World or perish.

110
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,640
Not unlike you, Mr. Turner.

111
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:15,480
You and your fiancée
face the hangman's noose.

112
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:20,680
- So you get Jack and the Black Pearl.
- The Black Pearl?

113
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:24,840
- The property you want that he possesses.
- A ship? Hardly.

114
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:28,800
The item in question is considerably
smaller and far more valuable,

115
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:32,360
something Sparrow keeps
on his person at all times.

116
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:34,960
A compass?

117
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,080
Ah, you know it.

118
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:42,600
Bring back that compass
or there's no deal.

119
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:09,160
Why is the rum always gone?

120
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:17,280
Oh.

121
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,840
That's why.

122
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,840
<i>(snoring)</i>

123
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,520
As you were, gents.

124
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,360
Ah.

125
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,080
<i>(man) Time's run out, Jack.</i>

126
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,400
Bootstrap.

127
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,520
Bill Turner.

128
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:32,400
You look good, Jack.

129
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,000
Is this a dream?

130
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,400
No.

131
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:45,960
I thought not.
If it were, there'd be rum.

132
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:55,880
You got the Pearl back, I see.

133
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:00,280
I had some help retrieving
the Pearl,by the way.

134
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,720
Your son.

135
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:06,200
William?

136
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:09,200
He ended up a pirate after all.

137
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:13,800
And to what do I owe
the pleasure of your carbuncle?

138
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,960
He sent me.

139
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:19,840
Davy Jones.

140
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,360
Oh.

141
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,360
So it's you, then.

142
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:29,120
He shanghaied you
into service, eh?

143
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,080
I chose it.

144
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:35,960
I'm sorry for the part I played
in the mutiny against you, Jack.

145
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:39,200
I stood up for you.

146
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:42,080
Everything went wrong after that.

147
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:48,280
They strapped me to a cannon.
I ended up on the bottom of the ocean,

148
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:51,200
the weight of the water
crushing down on me.

149
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:53,720
Unable to move.

150
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:56,920
Unable to die, Jack.

151
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:02,360
And I thought that even the tiniest hope
of escaping this fate, I would take it.

152
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:05,040
I would trade anything for it.

153
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:10,120
It's funny what a man will do
to forestall his final judgment.

154
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,800
You made a deal with him too, Jack.

155
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:15,400
He raised the Pearl
from the depths for you.

156
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:17,440
13 years, you've been her captain.

157
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:19,360
- Technically...
- Jack.

158
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:21,760
You won't be able
to talk yourself out of this.

159
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:24,520
The terms what applied to me
apply to you as well.

160
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:28,720
One soul bound to crew
100 years upon his ship.

161
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:31,120
Yes, with the Flying Dutchman
already has a captain...

162
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:33,440
Then it's the locker for you!

163
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:36,600
Jones's terrible leviathan will find you

164
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:40,840
and drag the Pearl back to the depths
and you along with it.

165
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:46,120
Any idea when Jones might release
said terrible beastie?

166
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,880
I already told you, Jack.

167
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,000
Your time is up.

168
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:55,840
It comes now,

169
00:15:55,920 --> 00:16:01,040
drawn with ravenous hunger
to the man what bears the black spot.

170
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:12,920
On deck, all hands!
Make fast the bunt gasket!

171
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,200
On deck! Scurry!

172
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:19,640
Scurry! I want movement!
Movement! I want movement!

173
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:23,360
Lift the skin up! Keep your loof!
Haul those sheets!

174
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:27,640
Run them! Run! Keep running! Run as if
the devil himself and itself is upon us!

- Argh! Run! Land.

176
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:39,440
- Which port?
- I didn't say "port", I said "land". Any land.

177

- Jack's hat! Bring her about!
- (Jack) No, no!

178

Leave it!

179
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:53,920
Run.

180
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:57,720
Back to your stations,
the lot of you!

181

- Shh.

For the love of mother and child, Jack,
what's coming after us?

183
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,560
Nothing.

Jack's compass?
What does Beckett want with that?

192
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:43,440
Does it matter? I'm to find Jack
and convince him to return to Port Royal.

193
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,960
In exchange, the charges
against us will be dropped.

194
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:49,560
No. We must find our own avenue
to secure your freedom.

195
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:52,080
Is that a lack of faith in Jack
or in me?

196
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,360
That you would risk your life
to save Sparrow

197
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:58,200
does not mean
he would do the same for anyone else.

- Eagerly, if you'll still have me.

I'd have you already.

Captain Jack Sparrow?

Owes me four doubloons.
Heard he was dead.

210
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:59,280
Singapore. That's what I heard.
Drunk, with a smile on his face.

211

Jack Sparrow turn up in Singapore.

I haven't seen him in a month.

When you find him,
will you give him a message?

Can't say about Jack Sparrow,

216
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,440

- C'est trop dangereux.

one, and that is promised
to Jack Sparrow.

Even if Will succeeds,

do not ask me to endure the sight of my
daughter walking to the gallows. Do not.

Perhaps I can ensure a fair trial
for Will if he returns.

These letters of marque

Yes, and they're not valid

- It will do you no good.
- Do explain.

I have been to the Isla de Muerta.
I have seen the treasure myself.

There is something

Ah, I see.

304
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:59,240
You think the compass
leads only to the Isla de Muerta

305
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:02,400
and so you hope to save me
from an evil fate.

306
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:05,440
But you mustn't worry.

307
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:09,160
I care not for cursed Aztec gold.

My desires are not so provincial.

309
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:16,480
There's more than one chest of value

Anyways, I ain't stealing no ship.

It ain't stealing. It's salvaging.

Since we're not immortal no more.
We gotta take care of our immortal souls.

00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,920
Thank you.

349
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:37,200
Why would he do this to us?
If Jack is the chief...

350
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:39,680
Aye, the Pelegostos
made Jack their chief,

351
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:43,200
but he only remains chief
as long as he acts like a chief.

352
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:46,240
So he had no choice.
He's a captive as much as the rest of us.

353
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:52,800
Worse, as it turns out. See, the Pelegostos
believe that Jack is a god in human form,

354
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:58,720
and they intend to do him the honor
of releasing him from his fleshy prison.

355
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:00,720
<i>(yelps)</i>

356
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:04,480
They'll roast him and eat him.

357
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:07,200
Where's the rest of the crew?

358
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:11,640
These cages we're in
weren't built till after we got here.

359
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:16,000
The feast is about to begin.

360
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:18,680
Jack's life will end

361
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:20,960
when the drums stop.

362
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:25,160
Well, we can't just sit here and wait,
then, can we?

363
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:30,040
No, no. Oi! No, no.

364
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:33,080
More wood. Big fire. Big fire.

365
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,240
I am Chief. Want big fire.

366
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:37,440
Come on.

367
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:40,720
<i>Oi. (cannibals' language)
Tout de suite.</i>

368
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:43,000
Come on. More wood.

369
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,760
Whoa!

370
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:50,560
Oh, bugger.

371
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:01,920
A little seasoning, eh?

372
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:16,760
Well done.

373
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:57,680
Put your legs through.
Start to climb!

374
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:02,720
Come on, men!
It'll take all of us to crew the Black Pearl!

375
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:05,440
Actually, you wouldn't need everyone.

376
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,720
About six would do.

377
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,920
Oh, dear.

378
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:18,800
- Hurry!
- Come on!

379
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,680
Come on! Is that all you got?

380
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:34,480
- Wait. Stop.
- Eh?

381
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:37,160
Stop. Shh.

382
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:45,960
Shh.

383
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:51,040
- (Marty) What are they doing?
- Stop.

384
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:59,960
- Snake!
- (screaming)

385
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,640
Move!

00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:52,360
No, no. Oi! No, no!

390
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:56,200
Not good.

391
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:13,960
Cut it loose! Find a rock!

392
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:30,080
<i>(Cannibals shouting)</i>

00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:33,920

The mooring line!

411
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:10,280
Thief! Little hairy thief!
Give it back!

00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:13,560
- Don't bite it!
- (Pintel) Haul loose the mooring line!

413
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:16,080
He's got me eye.
He won't give it back.

414
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:19,440
- How'd you get it back last time?
- Excellent! Our work's half done.

415
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:21,920
We done it for you,
knowing you'd be coming back.

416
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:24,840
- Make ready to sail, boys!
- What about Jack?

417
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:28,120
- I won't leave without him.
- (Jack) Oi!

418
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:38,800
- Time to go.
- Cast off those lines!

419
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,800
Aaargh!

420
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:50,080
- Make ready to cast off!
- Oi!

421
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:55,760
Good doggy.

422
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:16,600
Alas, my children, this is the day you shall
always remember as the day you almost...

423
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:21,680
Captain Jack Sparrow.

424
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:25,000
<i>(dog barks)</i>

425
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:49,360
Let's get away from this island
and head out to open sea.

426
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:53,720
Yes to the first. Yes to the second, but
only insofar as we keep to the shallows.

427
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:55,880
That seems a bit contradictory, Captain.

428
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:59,000
I have faith in your reconciliatory
navigational skills.

429
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:02,040
Now, where is that monkey?
I want to shoot something.

430
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:09,760
Jack. Elizabeth is in danger.

431
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:12,480
Have you considered
just locking her up somewhere?

432
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:15,040
She is locked up,
bound to hang for helping you.

433
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:19,880
There comes a time when one must
take responsibility for one's mistakes.

434
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:23,400
I need that compass of yours, Jack.

435
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:25,960
I must trade it for her freedom.

436
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:30,760
- Mr. Gibbs.
- Captain.

437
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:33,720
We have a need to travel upriver.

438
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:37,200
By need, do you mean a trifling need?

439
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:40,880
Fleeting?
As in, say, a passing fancy?

440
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:44,600
No, a resolute and unyielding need.

441
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:48,320
What we need to do
is make sail for Port Royal with all haste.

442
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:50,240
William,

443
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:52,320
I shall trade you the compass

444
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:54,120
if you will help me

445
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:56,280
to find this.

446
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:02,200
- You want me to find this?
- No.

447
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:05,680
You want you to find this,

448
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:09,680
because the finding of this
finds you incapacitorially finding

449
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:16,200
and/or locating in your discovering a way
to save your dolly belle, ol' what's-her-face.

450
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:19,000
Savvy?

451
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:22,920
This is going to save Elizabeth?

452
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:28,080
How much do you know
about Davy Jones?

453
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:31,680
Not much.

454
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:34,680
Yeah, it's going to save Elizabeth.

455
00:44:55,880 --> 00:44:57,760
<i>(arguing)</i>

456
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:02,480
What's all this?

457
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:07,840
If you both fancy the dress, you'll just have
to share and wear it one after the other.

458
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:11,120
It's not like that, sir.
This ship is haunted.

459
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:13,840
Is it, now? And you?

460
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:17,880
There's a female presence
amongst us here, sir.

461
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:20,320
All the men, they can feel it.

462
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:24,040
It's the ghost of a lady widowed
before her marriage, I figure it,

463
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:26,320
searching for her husband,
lost at sea.

464
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:28,840
A virgin too, likely as not.

465
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:31,080
And that bodes ill by all accounts.

466
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:35,480
I say that we throw the dress overboard
and we hope the spirit follows it.

467
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:38,320
No! That will just anger the spirit, sir.

468
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:42,280
What we need to do is find out what
the spirit needs, and then get it back to her.

469
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:44,480
Enough! Enough!

470
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:48,720
You're a pair of superstitious goats
and it's got the best of you.

471
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:51,840
Now, this appears to be no more
as we have a stowaway on board.

472
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:54,000
A young woman, by the look of it.

473
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:56,640
I want you to search the ship
and find her.

474
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:59,360
Oh, and, er... she's probably naked.

475
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:30,560
(Will) 
- Why is Jack afraid of the open ocean?

476
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:32,920
Well, if you believe such things,

477
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:36,080
there's a beast does the bidding
of Davy Jones,

478
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:40,520
A fearsome creature with giant tentacles
that'll suction your face clean off

479
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:44,080
and drag an entire ship
down to the crushing darkness.

480
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:47,720
The Kraken.

481
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:53,680
They say the stench of its breath is like...
(shudders)

482
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:57,120
Imagine, the last thing you know
on God's green earth

483
00:46:57,200 --> 00:47:02,880
is the roar of the kraken and the reeking
odor of a thousand rotting corpses.

484
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:07,080
If you believe such things.

485
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:09,880
And the key will spare him that?

486
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:13,360
Well, that's the very question
Jack wants answered.

487
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:15,800
Bad enough even to go visit...

488
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:18,760
her.

489
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:20,680
Her?

490
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:22,640
Aye.

491
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:59,760
No worries, mates.
Tia Dalma and I go way back.

492
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:03,640
Thick as thieves.
Nigh inseparable, we are.

493
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:05,960
Were. Have been.

494
00:48:07,120 --> 00:48:08,080
Before.

495
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:11,040
- I'll watch your back.
- It's me front I'm worried about.

496
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:13,480
- Mind the boat.
- Mind the boat.

497
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:16,760
- Mind the boat.
- Mind the boat.

498
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:18,840
- Mind the boat.
- (squawks)

499
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:21,000
Mind the boat.

500
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:35,440
Jack Sparrow.

501
00:48:35,560 --> 00:48:37,600
Tia Dalma.

502
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:42,720
I always knew the wind was going
to blow you back to me one day.

503
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:49,120
You...

504
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:53,920
You have a touch of...

505
00:48:54,040 --> 00:48:57,240
destiny about you,

506
00:48:57,360 --> 00:48:59,160
William Turner.

507
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:02,880
You know me?

508
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,480
You want to know me.

509
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:10,040
There'll be no knowing here. We've come
for help and we're not leaving without it.

510
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:13,600
- I thought I knew you.
- Not so well as I had hoped.

511
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:15,760
- Come.
- Come.

512
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:23,640
What service may I do you?

513
00:49:24,360 --> 00:49:28,120
- You know I demand payment.
- I brought payment. (whistles)

514
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:33,480
Look.

515
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:36,920
An undead monkey.

516
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:39,080
Top that.

517
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:46,600
Don't! You've no idea
how long it took us to catch that.

518
00:49:47,080 --> 00:49:49,440
The payment is fair.

519
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:51,440
We're looking for this.

520
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:56,640
And what it goes to.

521
00:49:58,040 --> 00:50:02,480
The compass you bartered from me,
it cannot lead you to this?

522
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:05,840
Maybe. Why?

523
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:08,160
I hear you.

524
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:12,560
Jack Sparrow does not know
what he wants.

525
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:15,320
Or do you know,

526
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:19,160
but are loath to claim it as your own?

527
00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:22,800
Your key go to a chest.

528
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:27,720
And it is what lay inside the chest
you seek, don't it?

529
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:30,600
- What is inside?
- Gold?

530
00:50:30,680 --> 00:50:34,560
Jewels? Unclaimed properties
of a valuable nature?

531
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:37,720
Nothing bad, I hope?

532
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:41,160
You know of Davy Jones,

533
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:42,760
yes?

534
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:45,480
A man of the sea.

535
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:47,760
A great sailor,

536
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:52,640
until he run afoul of that
which vex all men.

537
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:55,640
What vexes all men?

538
00:50:57,120 --> 00:50:59,480
What indeed?

539
00:51:00,040 --> 00:51:01,920
- The sea.
- Sums.

540
00:51:02,040 --> 00:51:04,920
The dichotomy of good and evil.

541
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:07,160
A woman.

542
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:09,000
A woman.

543
00:51:09,080 --> 00:51:11,040
He fell in love.

544
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:13,960
No, no, no, no.
I heard it was the sea he fell in love with.

545
00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:17,840
Same story, different versions,
and all are true.

546
00:51:17,960 --> 00:51:20,200
See, it was a woman

547
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:22,960
as changing and harsh

548
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:26,320
and untamable as the sea.

549
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:28,680
Him never stopped loving her.

550
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:33,360
But the pain it cause him
was too much to live with

551
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:36,040
but not enough to cause him to die.

552
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:42,040
What exactly did he put
into the chest?

553
00:51:42,120 --> 00:51:44,000
Him heart.

554
00:51:44,080 --> 00:51:46,040
Literally or figuratively?

555
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:50,520
He couldn't literally
put his heart in a chest.

556
00:51:50,600 --> 00:51:52,480
Could he?

557
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:58,400
It was not worth feeling
what small, fleeting joy life brings.

558
00:51:58,520 --> 00:52:00,080
And so...

559
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:02,760
him carve out him heart,

560
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:07,840
lock it away in a chest
and hide the chest from the world.

561
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:10,680
The key

562
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:15,160
he keep with him at all times.

563
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:19,280
- You knew this.
- I did not. I didn't know where the key was.

564
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:23,440
But now we do. All that's left is to climb
aboard the Flying Dutchman, grab the key,

565
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:26,160
you go back to Port Royal
and save your bonnie lass, eh?

566
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:28,960
Let me see your hand.

567
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,360
(Gibbs gasps) 
The black spot!

568
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:48,760
- (Ragetti moans) The black spot!
- (Pintel) Black spot!

569
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:52,160
My eyesight's as good as ever,
just so you know.

570
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:55,520
(Tia Dalma)
I have just the thing.
Now, where did I put it?

571
00:52:55,640 --> 00:52:58,120
<i>(clattering)</i>

572
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:02,240
My little beauty, where are you?

573
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:05,680
Such a long time in such a mess.

574
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:10,400
Davy Jones cannot make port.

575
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:13,720
Cannot step on land
but once every ten years.

576
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:17,360
Land is where you are safe,
Jack Sparrow,

577
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:19,840
and so you will carry land with you.

578
00:53:28,760 --> 00:53:30,640
Dirt.

579
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:35,240
- This is a jar of dirt.
- Yes.

580
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:40,240
Is the jar of dirt going to help?

581
00:53:40,360 --> 00:53:43,160
If you don't want it, give it back.

582
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:46,680
- No.
- Then it helps.

583
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:53,600
It seems we have a need to find
the Flying Dutchman.

584
00:53:56,640 --> 00:54:00,280
A touch of destiny.

585
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:17,560
That's the Flying Dutchman?

586
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:22,080
- She doesn't look like much.
- Neither do you.

587
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:24,400
Do not underestimate her.

588
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:30,040
- Must have run afoul of the reef.
- So, what's your plan, then?

589
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:33,440
I row over, search the ship
until I find your bloody key.

590
00:54:33,560 --> 00:54:35,800
And if there are crewmen?

591
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:38,040
I cut down anyone in my path.

592
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:41,680
I like it. Simple, easy to remember.

593
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:45,720
(Ragetti) Your chariot awaits you, Sire.
(cackles)

594
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:48,840
Oi!

595
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:54,480
If you do happen to get captured, just say
Jack Sparrow sent you to settle his debt.

596
00:54:54,560 --> 00:54:58,280
- It might save your life.
- (Ragetti) Bon voyage!

597
00:55:02,120 --> 00:55:04,560
Douse the lamps.

598
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,440
<i>(mutters)</i>

599
00:55:44,560 --> 00:55:45,560
Sailor.

600
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:48,120
- Hoisting the jib, Captain's orders.
- Sailor!

601
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:50,480
Hoisting the jib.
Bring up with a round turn.

602
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:53,160
There's no use.
You've run aground.

603
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:54,600
No.

604
00:55:54,680 --> 00:55:56,720
Beneath us.

605
00:55:57,560 --> 00:55:59,840
Foul breath.

606
00:55:59,960 --> 00:56:01,920

607
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:09,120

<i>(gasps)</i>

610
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:53,000
Down on your marrowbones and pray.

Get back! Get back!

Five men still alive.
The rest have moved on.

615
00:58:01,360 --> 00:58:04,400
Do you fear death?

616
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:10,360
Do you fear that dark abyss?

617
00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:14,920
All your deeds laid bare.

618
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:18,640
All your sins punished.

619
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:22,760
I can offer you

620
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:25,200
an escape.

621

<i>(man) Don't listen to him!</i>

Do you not fear death?

623
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:44,240
I'll take my chances, sir.

624
00:58:44,360 --> 00:58:46,640
To the depths.

625
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:53,840
Cruel blackguard!

626
00:58:53,960 --> 00:58:56,000
Life is cruel.

627
00:58:56,920 --> 00:58:59,560
Why should the afterlife
be any different?

628
00:59:00,080 --> 00:59:03,120
I offer you a choice.

629
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:05,760
Join my crew

630
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:08,080
and postpone the judgment.

631
00:59:09,480 --> 00:59:12,800
One hundred years before the mast.

632
00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:16,920
Will ye serve?

633
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:20,520
I-I will serve.

634
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:22,920
There.

635
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:24,960
<i>(laughter)</i>

636
00:59:29,560 --> 00:59:32,880
You are neither dead nor dying.

637
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,480
What is your purpose here?

638
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:41,240
Jack Sparrow sent me
to settle his debt.

639
00:59:42,320 --> 00:59:45,440
What is your purpose here?

640
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:48,560
Jack Sparrow
sent me to settle his debt.

641
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:53,880
Did he, now?

642
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:57,280
I'm sorely tempted to accept that offer.

643
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:08,320
<i>(frightened gasps)</i>

644
01:00:12,120 --> 01:00:13,080
Oh.

645
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:16,240
You have a debt to pay.

646
01:00:16,320 --> 01:00:19,600
You've been captain of the Black Pearl
for 13 years.

647
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:21,640
That was our agreement.

648
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:25,400
Technically I was only captain
for two years, then I was mutinied upon.

649
01:00:25,520 --> 01:00:29,120
Then you were a poor captain,
but a captain nonetheless.

650
01:00:29,240 --> 01:00:32,360
Have you not introduced yourself
all these years

651
01:00:32,440 --> 01:00:34,880
as Captain Jack Sparrow?

652
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,120
<i>(laughter)</i>

653
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:40,560
You have my payment.
One soul to serve on your ship.

654
01:00:40,680 --> 01:00:43,800
- One soul is not equal to another.
- Aha!

655
01:00:43,880 --> 01:00:50,120
We've established my proposal is sound
in principle. Now we're haggling over price.

656
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:52,680
Price?

657
01:00:54,640 --> 01:00:58,000
Just how many souls
do you think my soul is worth?

658
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:04,160
One hundred souls.

659
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:06,760
Three days.

660
01:01:07,240 --> 01:01:10,920
You're a diamond, mate. Send me back
the boy. I'll get started right off.

661
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:14,000
I keep the boy.
A good-faith payment.

662
01:01:14,120 --> 01:01:17,920
That leaves you only 99 more to go.
(laughs)

663
01:01:19,600 --> 01:01:21,480
Have you not met Will Turner?

664
01:01:21,600 --> 01:01:24,320
He's noble, heroic,
a terrific soprano.

665
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:26,640
Worth at least four.

666
01:01:26,760 --> 01:01:28,880
Maybe three and a half.

667
01:01:29,680 --> 01:01:32,560
And did I happen to mention...

668
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:34,960
he's in love?

669
01:01:35,800 --> 01:01:38,280
With a girl.

670
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:40,680
Due to be married.

671
01:01:40,800 --> 01:01:42,680
Betrothed.

672
01:01:43,600 --> 01:01:48,080
Dividing him from her and her from him
would only be half as cruel

673
01:01:48,200 --> 01:01:52,000
as actually allowing them
to be joined in holy matrimony.

674
01:01:52,120 --> 01:01:54,000
Eh?

675
01:01:56,680 --> 01:02:01,360
I keep the boy. 99 souls.

676
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:04,000
But I wonder, Sparrow,

677
01:02:04,080 --> 01:02:06,200
can you live with this?

678
01:02:06,920 --> 01:02:10,560
Can you condemn an innocent man,
a friend,

679
01:02:10,680 --> 01:02:15,400
to a lifetime of servitude in your name
while you roam free?

680
01:02:18,520 --> 01:02:20,480
Yep. I'm good with it.

681
01:02:20,560 --> 01:02:23,600
Shall we seal it in blood?
I mean... ink.

682
01:02:24,280 --> 01:02:26,160
<i>(gasps)</i>

683
01:02:27,720 --> 01:02:30,360
Three days.

01:02:34,680 --> 01:02:36,720
- Three days.

685
01:02:44,040 --> 01:02:46,840
- Er, Mr. Gibbs.
- Aye.

686
01:02:46,920 --> 01:02:49,400
I-I feel sullied and unusual.

687
01:02:49,520 --> 01:02:55,040
And how do you intend to harvest
these 99 souls in three days?

688
01:02:55,160 --> 01:02:59,680
Fortunately, he was mum as to
the condition in which these souls need be.

689
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:00,920
Ah.

690
01:03:01,040 --> 01:03:02,920
Tortuga.

691
01:03:03,960 --> 01:03:05,360
Tortuga.

692
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:12,640
It's an outrage.
Port tariffs, berthing fees,

693
01:03:12,760 --> 01:03:15,880
wharf handling
and, heaven help us, pilotage.

694
01:03:15,960 --> 01:03:20,160
Are we all to work for
the East India Trading Company, then?

695
01:03:20,240 --> 01:03:24,520
I'm afraid, sir, Tortuga is
the only free port left in these waters.

696
01:03:24,600 --> 01:03:27,080
A pirate port is what you mean.
Well, I'm sorry.

697
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:32,400
An honest sailor is what I am. I make
my living fair and I sleep well each night.

(Bursar) She wants you
to do something.

701
01:04:02,720 --> 01:04:05,280
She's trying to give a sign.

702
01:04:09,160 --> 01:04:10,560
Whoa!

703
01:04:13,320 --> 01:04:15,680
Over there! Look for a sign!

01:04:20,280 --> 01:04:22,320
Look, there! There it is!

706
01:04:22,800 --> 01:04:25,240
- There's the sign!
- That's seaweed.

707
01:04:25,360 --> 01:04:28,320
- Seaweed can be a sign.
- Looks like entrails.

708
01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:33,240
- That would be a bad sign.
- (Deep voice) What's that over there?

709
01:04:50,840 --> 01:04:53,880
And what makes you think
you're worthy to crew the Black Pearl?

710
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,120
I've never sailed a day in me life.

711
01:04:56,240 --> 01:04:59,280
I figure I should get out,
see the world while I'm still young.

712
01:04:59,360 --> 01:05:02,560
You'll do. Make your mark.
Next!

713
01:05:02,680 --> 01:05:05,240
My wife ran off with my dog

714
01:05:05,680 --> 01:05:08,000
and I'm drunk for a month

715
01:05:08,120 --> 01:05:10,080
and I don't give an ass rat's

716
01:05:10,200 --> 01:05:12,080
if I live or die.

717
01:05:12,160 --> 01:05:15,040
- Perfect. Next!
- I know what I want. I know what I want...

718
01:05:15,160 --> 01:05:19,120
- Me have one arm and a bum leg.
- It's the crow's nest for you.

719
01:05:19,200 --> 01:05:21,240
- I know what I want.
- (Gibbs) Next!

720
01:05:21,360 --> 01:05:26,720
Ever since I was a little lad, I've always
wanted to sail the seas... forever.

721
01:05:26,840 --> 01:05:29,400
Sooner than you think.
Sign the roster.

722
01:05:29,520 --> 01:05:31,680
Thanks very much.

723
01:05:31,800 --> 01:05:36,720
- (Jack) How we going?
- Including those four, that gives us... four.

724
01:05:40,080 --> 01:05:42,120
And what's your story?

725
01:05:42,240 --> 01:05:44,600
(Norrington) 
My story.

726
01:05:44,720 --> 01:05:49,560
It's exactly the same as your story,
just one chapter behind.

727
01:05:49,680 --> 01:05:53,120
I chased a man
across the seven seas.

728
01:05:53,240 --> 01:05:55,960
The pursuit cost me my crew,

729
01:05:56,040 --> 01:05:58,600
my commission,

730
01:05:58,680 --> 01:06:00,720
and my life.

731
01:06:05,600 --> 01:06:10,200
- Commodore?
- No, not any more. Weren't you listening?

732
01:06:13,120 --> 01:06:15,560
I nearly had you all off Tripoli.

733
01:06:16,320 --> 01:06:20,680
I would have,
if not for the hurricane.

734
01:06:20,760 --> 01:06:22,080
Lord.

735
01:06:22,160 --> 01:06:24,040
You didn't try to sail through it?

736
01:06:24,160 --> 01:06:26,560
So, do I make your crew

737
01:06:26,680 --> 01:06:28,560
or not?

738
01:06:29,400 --> 01:06:32,040
You haven't said where you're going.

739
01:06:32,120 --> 01:06:34,080
Somewhere nice?!

740
01:06:35,120 --> 01:06:37,400
So, am I worthy to serve

741
01:06:37,520 --> 01:06:40,160
under Captain Jack Sparrow?

742
01:06:42,560 --> 01:06:45,840
Or should I just kill you now?

743
01:06:51,720 --> 01:06:53,760
You're hired.

744
01:06:53,880 --> 01:06:57,680
Sorry. Old habits and all that.

745
01:06:57,800 --> 01:07:01,160
- Easy, sailor!
- That's our captain you're threatening.

- Aye!

748
01:07:58,560 --> 01:08:01,520
- Thanks, mate.
- Aargh!

749
01:08:05,960 --> 01:08:07,760
Carry on.

750
01:08:14,800 --> 01:08:17,240
Come on, then! Who wants some?

751
01:08:17,360 --> 01:08:20,720
Form an orderly line
and I'll have you all, one by one.

Come on, who's first?

I just wanted the pleasure
of doing that myself.

773
01:10:38,120 --> 01:10:43,120
And what would prompt
such an act of charity?

774
01:10:46,720 --> 01:10:48,600
My son.

01:10:53,320 --> 01:10:55,520

So I'm to understand
what you did was an act of compassion?

790
01:12:38,040 --> 01:12:40,080
Yes.

Not until your debt is paid.

795
01:13:03,960 --> 01:13:06,280
I've sworn no oath.

796
01:13:07,960 --> 01:13:10,000
You must get away.

The key.

The dead man's chest.

What do you know of this?

801
01:13:28,960 --> 01:13:33,440
Open the chest with the key,
and stab the heart...

802
01:13:33,560 --> 01:13:36,520
No, don't stab the heart.

803
01:13:36,640 --> 01:13:41,440
The Dutchman needs a living heart
or there'll be no captain,

804
01:13:41,560 --> 01:13:45,680
and if there's no captain,
there's no one to have the key.

805
01:13:46,080 --> 01:13:48,520
So the captain has the key?

806
01:13:49,720 --> 01:13:52,360
- Where is the key?
- Hidden.

807
01:13:52,760 --> 01:13:55,400
- Where is the chest?
- Hidden.

Hide the rum.

01:14:19,560 --> 01:14:22,280
These clothes do not flatter you.
It should be a dress or nothing.

- I happen to have no dress in my cabin.
- Jack.

817

I know Will came to find you.
Where is he?

01:14:30,680 --> 01:14:34,040
Darling, I am truly unhappy
to have to tell you this, but...

that had nothing whatsoever to do with me,

Are you certain?
Is that what you really want most?

830
01:15:15,200 --> 01:15:17,440
Of course.

831
01:15:17,560 --> 01:15:21,600
Because I would think you'd want to find
a way to save Will most.

832
01:15:22,240 --> 01:15:25,920
- And you'd have a way of doing that?
- Well...

833
01:15:26,040 --> 01:15:29,160
- ...there is a chest.
- Oh, dear.

834
01:15:29,240 --> 01:15:31,440
A chest of unknown size and origin.

835
01:15:31,560 --> 01:15:36,240
What contains
the still-beating heart of Davy Jones.

836

And whoever possesses that chest

01:15:39,480 --> 01:15:43,240
possesses the leverage to command Jones
to do whatever it is he or she wants,

838

including saving brave William
from his grim fate.

839

You don't actually believe him, do you?

840
01:15:56,160 --> 01:15:58,360
How would we find it?

841
01:16:00,480 --> 01:16:02,200
With this.

842
01:16:02,320 --> 01:16:05,120

01:16:05,640 --> 01:16:08,680
"Unique" here
having the meaning of "broken".

844
01:16:09,680 --> 01:16:13,880
True enough,
this compass does not point north.

And what you want most in this world

851
01:16:36,720 --> 01:16:41,400
is to find the chest of Davy Jones,
is it not?

852
01:16:41,520 --> 01:16:46,240
- To save Will.
- By finding the chest of Davy Jones.

01:17:00,720 --> 01:17:02,960
- Mr. Gibbs!
- Cap'n.

- We have our heading.
- Finally!

855
01:17:05,280 --> 01:17:09,680
Cast off those lines.
Weigh anchor and crowd that canvas!

- Miss Swann.

Welcome to the crew,
former commodore.

There's something to knowing the exact
shape of the world and one's place in it.

I assure you, these are not necessary.

860
01:17:30,920 --> 01:17:35,200
I thought you'd be interested
in the whereabouts of your daughter.

- You have news of her?
- Most recently seen on Tortuga,

862
01:17:38,720 --> 01:17:42,520
and then left in the company
of a known pirate, Jack Sparrow,

863
01:17:42,600 --> 01:17:45,400

864
01:17:45,480 --> 01:17:47,240
"Justice"? Hardly.

865
01:17:47,320 --> 01:17:52,880
Including the previous owner of this sword,
I believe.

866
01:17:53,360 --> 01:17:57,920
Our ships are in pursuit. Justice will
be dispensed by cannonade and cutlass,

867
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:01,800
and all manner
of remorseless pieces of metal.

868
01:18:01,880 --> 01:18:07,640
I find it distasteful to even contemplate
the horror facing all those on board.

01:18:12,640 --> 01:18:15,680
Your authority as governor,
your influence in London,

871
01:18:15,760 --> 01:18:19,200
and your loyalty
to the East India Trading Company.

872
01:18:20,200 --> 01:18:22,640
To you, you mean.

873
01:18:26,120 --> 01:18:28,760
Shall I remove these shackles?

874
01:18:31,840 --> 01:18:35,120
Do what you can for my daughter.

875
01:18:41,120 --> 01:18:45,880
(Beckett)
 So you see, Mercer, every man
has a price he will willingly accept.

876
01:18:45,960 --> 01:18:49,680
Even for what he hoped never to sell.

877
01:18:55,120 --> 01:18:58,120
I wager... ten years.

878
01:18:58,960 --> 01:19:01,200
I'll match ten years.

879
01:19:02,160 --> 01:19:03,800
Agreed.

880
01:19:06,680 --> 01:19:09,320
Wondering how it's played?

881
01:19:09,400 --> 01:19:11,200
- I understand.
- Liar!

882
01:19:11,280 --> 01:19:16,640
(Will)
 It's a game of deception. But your bet
includes all the dice, not just your own.

883
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:19,920
- What are they wagering?
- Oh, the only thing we have.

884
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,280
Years of service.

885
01:19:24,320 --> 01:19:28,360
- So any crew member can be challenged?
- Aye. Anyone.

886
01:19:31,120 --> 01:19:33,760
I challenge Davy Jones.

887
01:19:35,760 --> 01:19:37,880
<i>(Heavy footsteps)</i>

888
01:19:52,600 --> 01:19:55,440
I accept, mate.

889
01:20:06,520 --> 01:20:11,840
- The stakes?
- My soul. An eternity of servitude.

890
01:20:11,920 --> 01:20:14,040
No!

891
01:20:16,120 --> 01:20:17,600
Against?

892
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:20,920
I want this.

893
01:20:32,560 --> 01:20:37,280
- How do you know of the key?
- That's not part of the game, is it?

894
01:20:40,320 --> 01:20:42,840
You can still walk away.

895
01:21:06,520 --> 01:21:09,480
- What's this?
- I'm in. Matching his wager.

896
01:21:09,560 --> 01:21:12,360
No! Don't do this.

897
01:21:14,200 --> 01:21:16,880
The die is cast.

898
01:21:16,960 --> 01:21:19,920
I bid three twos.

899
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,080
It's your bid, Captain.

900
01:21:28,120 --> 01:21:31,000
Four fours.

901
01:21:39,720 --> 01:21:42,720
Four fives.

902
01:21:42,800 --> 01:21:44,440
Six threes.

903
01:21:53,720 --> 01:21:56,760
Seven fives.

904
01:22:19,680 --> 01:22:21,880
Eight fives.

905
01:22:26,400 --> 01:22:29,760
Welcome to the crew, lad.

906
01:22:31,840 --> 01:22:34,720
Twelve fives.

907
01:22:34,960 --> 01:22:36,560
Twelve fives.

908
01:22:36,640 --> 01:22:39,360
Call me a liar, or up the bid.

909
01:22:40,640 --> 01:22:44,080
And be called a liar myself
for my trouble?

910
01:22:47,400 --> 01:22:52,080
Bootstrap Bill, you're a liar
and you will spend an eternity on this ship.

911
01:22:53,920 --> 01:22:57,960
Master Turner,
feel free to go ashore...

912
01:22:59,200 --> 01:23:02,200
the very next time we make port!

913
01:23:09,480 --> 01:23:12,880
Fool. Why did you do that?

914
01:23:14,360 --> 01:23:16,480
I couldn't let you lose.

915
01:23:16,560 --> 01:23:19,200
It was never about winning or losing.

916
01:23:21,480 --> 01:23:22,880
The key.

917
01:23:24,480 --> 01:23:27,240
You just wanted to know where it was.

918
01:23:28,760 --> 01:23:30,680
<i>(Snores)</i>

919
01:23:46,040 --> 01:23:48,560
Captain says I'm to relieve you.

920
01:23:52,400 --> 01:23:54,400
Captain's orders.

921
01:24:15,440 --> 01:24:17,360
<i>(Snores)</i>

922
01:24:27,600 --> 01:24:29,160
<i>(Grunts)</i>

923
01:24:47,320 --> 01:24:48,480
<i>(Plays note)</i>

924
01:24:52,200 --> 01:24:54,440
<i>(Plays lullaby)</i>

925
01:25:39,720 --> 01:25:42,200
Here. Take this, too.

926
01:25:43,120 --> 01:25:46,360
Now, get yourself to land, and stay there.

927
01:25:46,800 --> 01:25:49,920
It was always in my blood to die at sea.

928
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,920
It was not a fate I ever wanted for you.

929
01:25:57,480 --> 01:26:01,040
It's not a fate you had to choose
for yourself, either.

930
01:26:01,120 --> 01:26:07,080
Aye. I could say I did what I had to,
when I left you to go pirating.

931
01:26:07,960 --> 01:26:12,120
But it would taste a lie
to say it wasn't what I wanted.

932
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:16,320
You owe me nothing, Will.

933
01:26:16,400 --> 01:26:18,520
Now go.

934
01:26:19,600 --> 01:26:22,160
- They'll know you helped me.
- (Laughs)

935
01:26:23,480 --> 01:26:25,400
What more can they do to me?

936
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:33,160
I take this with a promise.

937
01:26:33,240 --> 01:26:35,560
I'll find a way to sever
Jones's hold on you,

938
01:26:35,640 --> 01:26:39,360
and not rest until this blade
pierces his heart.

939
01:26:40,800 --> 01:26:43,040
I will not abandon you.

940
01:26:45,560 --> 01:26:48,040
I promise.

941
01:27:01,600 --> 01:27:03,640
- (Gibbs) Beckett?
- (Elizabeth) Yes, they're signed.

942
01:27:03,720 --> 01:27:06,160
Lord Cutler Beckett
of the East India Trading Company.

943
01:27:06,240 --> 01:27:07,600
Bleurgh!

944
01:27:07,680 --> 01:27:11,280
Will was working for Beckett
and never said a word.

945
01:27:11,640 --> 01:27:15,280
Beckett wants the compass.
Only one reason for that.

946
01:27:15,360 --> 01:27:17,800
Of course.

947
01:27:17,880 --> 01:27:21,480
- He wants the chest.
- Yes, he did say something about a chest.

948
01:27:21,560 --> 01:27:25,040
If the company controls the chest,
they controls the sea.

949
01:27:25,120 --> 01:27:28,720
- A truly discomfiting notion, love.
- And bad.

950
01:27:28,800 --> 01:27:32,320
Bad for every mother's son
what calls himself a pirate.

951
01:27:32,400 --> 01:27:35,520
I think there's a bit more speed
to be coaxed from these sails.

952
01:27:35,600 --> 01:27:37,640
Brace the foreyard!

953
01:27:37,720 --> 01:27:40,800
Might I enquire
as to how you came by these?

954
01:27:40,880 --> 01:27:42,720
- Persuasion.
- Friendly?

955
01:27:42,800 --> 01:27:44,360
Decidedly not.

956
01:27:44,440 --> 01:27:49,800
Will strikes a deal, yet you were the one
with the prize - full pardon.

957
01:27:49,880 --> 01:27:52,120
"Commission as a privateer
on behalf of England

958
01:27:52,200 --> 01:27:54,800
and the East India Trading Company."

959
01:27:54,880 --> 01:27:57,080
As if I could be bought
for such a low price.

960
01:27:57,160 --> 01:27:59,560
- Jack, the letters, give them back.
- No.

961
01:27:59,640 --> 01:28:01,880
Persuade me.

962
01:28:01,960 --> 01:28:05,600
You do know Will taught me
how to handle a sword?

963
01:28:07,880 --> 01:28:11,440
As I said, persuade me.

964
01:28:25,120 --> 01:28:27,480
It's a curious thing.

965
01:28:28,520 --> 01:28:33,960
There was a time I would have wanted you
to look like that while thinking about me.

966
01:28:34,040 --> 01:28:36,120
- I don't know what you mean.
- I think you do.

967
01:28:36,200 --> 01:28:39,120
Oh, don't be absurd.
I trust him, that's all.

968
01:28:43,600 --> 01:28:45,800
So you never wondered
how your latest fiancé

969
01:28:45,880 --> 01:28:49,760
ended up on the Flying Dutchman
in the first place?

970
01:29:13,240 --> 01:29:16,400
(man) Strange thing to come upon
a longboat so far out in open water.

971
01:29:16,480 --> 01:29:19,760
Just put as many leagues behind us
as you can. As fast as you can.

972
01:29:19,840 --> 01:29:22,840
And what are we running from?

973
01:29:27,440 --> 01:29:30,120
That dress. Where did you get it?

974
01:29:30,200 --> 01:29:31,840
It was found aboard the ship.

975
01:29:31,920 --> 01:29:36,240
The crew thought it was a spirit
bringing some omen of ill-fate.

976
01:29:36,320 --> 01:29:39,600
- That's foolish.
- Oh, yes. Exceedingly foolish.

977
01:29:39,680 --> 01:29:45,440
It brought good fortune.
The spirit told us, "Pull in at Tortuga",

978
01:29:45,520 --> 01:29:47,440
and we made a nice bit of profit there.

979
01:29:47,520 --> 01:29:50,520
Off the books, of course.

980
01:29:50,600 --> 01:29:54,240
I imagine some of your crew
may have jumped ship there.

981
01:29:54,320 --> 01:29:57,080
- Why do you ask?
- Captain! A ship's been spotted.

982
01:29:57,160 --> 01:29:59,880
- Colors?
- She isn't flying any.

983
01:29:59,960 --> 01:30:01,880
- Pirates.
- Or worse.

984
01:30:12,880 --> 01:30:16,320
You will watch this.

985
01:30:19,360 --> 01:30:21,080
Aagh!

986
01:30:23,160 --> 01:30:26,040
Let no joyful voice be heard!

987
01:30:28,080 --> 01:30:31,120
Let no man look up at the sky with hope.

988
01:30:31,200 --> 01:30:32,880
Aargh!

989
01:30:33,320 --> 01:30:38,840
And let this day be cursed
by we who ready to wake...

990
01:30:40,240 --> 01:30:42,320
the kraken.

991
01:30:42,720 --> 01:30:44,320
No!

992
01:31:00,520 --> 01:31:02,960
I've doomed us all.

993

01:31:13,240 --> 01:31:15,680
Must have hit a reef.

997
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:25,920
Free the rudder!
Hard to port then hard to starboard.

998
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:29,360

Aaagh!

The boy's not here.
He must have been claimed by the sea.

1009
01:34:08,400 --> 01:34:10,800
I am the sea.

1010
01:34:14,320 --> 01:34:17,440
You need time alone with your thoughts.

1011
01:34:17,520 --> 01:34:19,960
- Brig!
- What of the survivors?

1012
01:34:25,240 --> 01:34:28,480
There are no survivors.

"First"?

1017
01:34:56,160 --> 01:34:59,240
Who sent that thieving charlatan

1018
01:34:59,320 --> 01:35:01,200
Who told him of the key?

1019
01:35:04,200 --> 01:35:06,280
Jack Sparrow.

1020
01:35:23,880 --> 01:35:30,400
My intuitive sense of the female creature
informs me that you are troubled.

1021
01:35:30,480 --> 01:35:33,760
I just thought I'd be married by now.

1022
01:35:33,840 --> 01:35:36,080
I'm so ready to be married.

1023
01:35:43,320 --> 01:35:45,280
You know...

<i>(Clears throat)</i>

01:36:08,080 --> 01:36:10,280
No, thank you.

1030
01:36:10,360 --> 01:36:11,840
Why not?

1031
01:36:11,920 --> 01:36:14,840
We are very much alike, you and I.
I and you. Us.

1032
01:36:14,920 --> 01:36:19,800
Oh. Except for a sense of honor
and decency and a moral center.

1033
01:36:20,240 --> 01:36:22,560
And personal hygiene.

1034
01:36:23,960 --> 01:36:26,160
Trifles.

1035
01:36:26,240 --> 01:36:28,680
You will come over to my side. I know it.

1036
01:36:28,760 --> 01:36:33,840
- You seem very certain.
- One word, love. Curiosity.

1037
01:36:33,920 --> 01:36:35,480
You long for freedom.

1038
01:36:35,560 --> 01:36:38,520
You long to do what you want to do
because you want it.

1039
01:36:38,600 --> 01:36:41,560
To act on selfish impulse.

1040
01:36:41,640 --> 01:36:44,280
You want to see what it's like.

1041
01:36:44,360 --> 01:36:48,640
One day, you won't be able to resist.

1042
01:36:49,160 --> 01:36:51,640
Why doesn't your compass work?

1043
01:36:53,200 --> 01:36:56,160
My compass works fine.

1044
01:36:56,560 --> 01:36:58,280
Because you and I are alike,

1045
01:36:58,360 --> 01:37:01,480
and there will come a moment
when you have a chance to show it.

1046
01:37:01,560 --> 01:37:04,720
- To do the right thing.
- I love those moments.

1047
01:37:05,200 --> 01:37:07,400
I like to wave at them as they pass by.

1048
01:37:07,480 --> 01:37:12,840
You'll have the chance to do something...
something courageous.

1049
01:37:12,920 --> 01:37:15,960
And when you do,
you'll discover something.

1050
01:37:16,040 --> 01:37:18,520
That you're a good man.

1051
01:37:18,600 --> 01:37:21,000
All evidence to the contrary.

1052
01:37:21,080 --> 01:37:24,000
Oh, I have faith in you.

1053
01:37:24,080 --> 01:37:26,880
- Want to know why?
- Do tell, dearie.

1054
01:37:28,600 --> 01:37:31,480
Curiosity.

1055
01:37:31,560 --> 01:37:34,400
You're going to want it.

1056
01:37:34,480 --> 01:37:38,200
A chance to be admired
and gain the rewards that follow.

1057
01:37:39,480 --> 01:37:41,560
You won't be able to resist.

1058
01:37:42,880 --> 01:37:47,880
You're going to want to know
what it tastes like.

1059
01:37:50,320 --> 01:37:53,200
I do want to know what it tastes like.

1060
01:37:53,280 --> 01:37:55,000
But... seeing as you're a good man,

1061
01:37:55,080 --> 01:37:59,320
I know that you'd never put me in a position
that would compromise my honor.

1062
01:38:07,280 --> 01:38:09,320
I'm proud of you, Jack.

1063
01:38:09,400 --> 01:38:12,120
(Gibbs) Land, ho!

1064
01:38:17,080 --> 01:38:18,840
I want my jar of dirt.

1065
01:38:20,240 --> 01:38:23,040
- You're pulling too fast.
- You're pulling too slow.

1066
01:38:23,120 --> 01:38:28,040
- We don't want the kraken to catch us.
- I'm saving me strength for when it comes.

1067
01:38:28,120 --> 01:38:32,360
And I don't think it's "Kracken" anyways.
I always heard it said "Krayken".

1068
01:38:32,440 --> 01:38:34,000
- With a long "a"?
- Uh-huh.

1069
01:38:34,080 --> 01:38:37,800
No, no, no, no, no, no, no. "Krocken"
is how it's pronounced in Scandinavian,

1070
01:38:37,880 --> 01:38:39,560
and "Kracken" is closer to that.

1071
01:38:39,640 --> 01:38:42,960
We ain't Scandinavians, are we?
"Krayken."

1072
01:38:43,040 --> 01:38:45,640
It's a mythological creature.
I can calls it what I wants.

1073
01:38:49,360 --> 01:38:51,520
Guard the boat. Mind the tide.

1074
01:38:51,600 --> 01:38:53,840
Don't touch my dirt.

1075
01:39:28,240 --> 01:39:33,240
This doesn't work. And it certainly
doesn't show you what you want most.

1076
01:39:37,240 --> 01:39:40,440
(Jack) Yes, it does.
You're sitting on it.

1077
01:39:41,280 --> 01:39:42,920
- Beg pardon?
- Move.

1078
01:39:50,320 --> 01:39:53,000
- "Guard the boat!" "Mind the tide!"
- I could join the circus.

1079
01:39:53,080 --> 01:39:54,640
Mind if I shine your shoes, sir?

1080
01:39:58,880 --> 01:40:03,400
They're here. And I cannot step foot
on land again for near of a decade.

1081
01:40:03,480 --> 01:40:05,400
You'll trust us to act in your stead?

1082
01:40:05,480 --> 01:40:08,720
I'll trust you to know
what awaits you should you fail!

1083
01:40:10,240 --> 01:40:13,120

You actually were telling the truth.

1088

I do that quite a lot,
yet people are always surprised.

You're all right! Thank God!
I came to find you!

1092
01:41:43,160 --> 01:41:45,200
(Jack) How did you get here?

1093
01:41:45,280 --> 01:41:49,080
Sea turtles, mate.
A pair of them, strapped to my feet.

1094
01:41:49,160 --> 01:41:50,960
Not so easy, is it?

1095
01:41:51,040 --> 01:41:53,560
- But I do owe you thanks, Jack.
- You do?

1096
01:41:53,640 --> 01:41:57,640
After you tricked me onto that ship
to square your debt with Jones...

1097
01:41:57,720 --> 01:41:59,680
- What?
- (imitates Elizabeth) What?

1098
01:42:00,240 --> 01:42:02,800
...I was reunited with my father.

1099
01:42:02,880 --> 01:42:05,480
Oh, well... you're welcome, then.

1100
01:42:05,960 --> 01:42:09,640
Everything you said to me,
every word was a lie!

1101
01:42:09,720 --> 01:42:11,160
Pretty much.

1102
01:42:11,240 --> 01:42:13,520

Oi! What are you doing?

1104
01:42:16,800 --> 01:42:19,080
I'm going to kill Jones.

1105
01:42:20,040 --> 01:42:22,240
Can't let you do that, William.

1106
01:42:22,320 --> 01:42:28,120
Cos if Jones is dead, who's to call
his terrible beastie off the hunt, eh?

1107
01:42:33,920 --> 01:42:37,120
Now, if you please.

1108
01:42:37,760 --> 01:42:40,200
The key.

1109
01:42:42,280 --> 01:42:44,880
I keep the promises I make, Jack.

1110
01:42:44,960 --> 01:42:48,160
I intend to free my father.
I hope you're here to see it.

1111
01:42:48,240 --> 01:42:51,720
I can't let you do that either.
So sorry.

1112
01:42:51,800 --> 01:42:55,280
I knew you'd warm up to me eventually.

1113
01:42:56,080 --> 01:42:59,880
Lord Beckett desires
the content of that chest.

I deliver it, I get my life back.

1115

Ah. The dark side of ambition.

1116
01:43:06,360 --> 01:43:09,640
Oh, I prefer to see it
as the promise of redemption.

This is no way for grown men to...

1123
01:43:31,920 --> 01:43:37,240
Oh, fine! Let's just haul out our swords
and start banging away at each other.

1124
01:43:37,320 --> 01:43:39,840
That will solve everything! I've had it!

1125
01:43:39,920 --> 01:43:44,680
I've had it with wobbly-legged,
rum-soaked pirates!

1126
01:43:47,200 --> 01:43:52,160
- How'd this go all screwy?
- Well, each wants the chest for hisself.

1127
01:43:52,240 --> 01:43:55,280
Mr. Norrington, I think,
is trying to regain a bit of honor,

1128
01:43:55,360 --> 01:43:57,760
old Jack's looking to trade it,
save his own skin,

1129
01:43:57,840 --> 01:44:01,840
then Turner, there, I think he's trying
to settle some unresolved business

1130
01:44:01,920 --> 01:44:05,400
'twixt him and his
twice-cursed pirate father. (belches)

1131
01:44:05,480 --> 01:44:07,360
- Sad.
- (Elizabeth) This is madness!

1132
01:44:07,440 --> 01:44:11,080
That chest must be worth
more than a shiny penny.

1133
01:44:11,160 --> 01:44:13,000
Terrible temptation.

1134
01:44:13,080 --> 01:44:18,840
If we was any kind of decent,
we'd remove temptation from their path.

- Let us examine that claim for a moment.

1146
01:46:54,080 --> 01:46:59,320
Who was it, that at the very moment you
had a notorious pirate safely behind bars,

1147
01:46:59,400 --> 01:47:05,440
saw fit to free said pirate and
take your dearly beloved all to hisself?

Eh?

1149
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:09,480
So whose fault is it, really,

1150
01:47:09,560 --> 01:47:13,760
that you've ended up a rum-pot deckhand
what takes orders from pirates?

- Aye, Captain.

Aaargh!

1214
01:57:08,800 --> 01:57:10,280
Make fast!

01:57:11,480 --> 01:57:13,920
Go on, me darling!
Show us what you've got!

Come on, girl!

- Aye. We've got her!

1218
01:57:24,840 --> 01:57:28,400
- We're the faster?
- Against the wind, the Dutchman beats us.

1219
01:57:28,480 --> 01:57:30,840
- But with the wind...
- We rob her advantage.

1220
01:57:30,920 --> 01:57:32,680
Aye.

1221
01:57:34,640 --> 01:57:36,120
We're out of range!

1222
01:57:36,200 --> 01:57:40,640
Break off pursuit,
run her light and douse canvas!

We're giving up, sir?

We can take her.
We should turn and fight.

1229
01:58:05,320 --> 01:58:12,000
Why fight when you can negotiate?
All one needs is the proper leverage.

We must have hit a reef!

No. It's not a reef!
Get away from the rail!

- The kraken.

- To arms!
- Load guns! Defend the mast!

1237
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:44,280
It'll attack the starboard. Run out
the cannons and hold for my signal!

Easy, boys!

- Whatever you do, don't miss.
- As soon as you're clear.

We are short-stocked on gunpowder!
Six barrels!

No. We just made it angry.

She's only a ship, mate.

1277
02:05:20,840 --> 02:05:23,280
He's right.
We have to head for land.

- It's a lot of open water.
- It's a lot of water.

We have to try. We can get away

Abandon ship.

1281

Abandon ship or abandon hope.

Turns out not even Jack Sparrow
can best the devil.

Is there any news on the chest?

1312
02:10:56,160 --> 02:11:01,560
None. But one of the ships
did pick up a man adrift at sea.

He had these.

If you intend to claim these,
then you must have something to trade.

It's a shame.

I know you're thinking that with the Pearl

1324
02:12:51,040 --> 02:12:56,200
you could have captured the devil
and set free your father's soul.

1325
02:12:56,280 --> 02:12:58,920
Doesn't matter now.

finally won out.

He was a good man.

If there was anything could be done
to bring him back...

1336
02:13:53,200 --> 02:13:55,440
- Elizabeth.

What would any of you
be willing to do, hm?

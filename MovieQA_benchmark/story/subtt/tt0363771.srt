1
00:01:20,894 --> 00:01:25,727


2
00:01:32,999 --> 00:01:35,868
Edmund! Get away from there!

3
00:01:35,942 --> 00:01:38,463
Peter! What do you think you're doing?

4
00:01:38,535 --> 00:01:40,192
Peter, quickly, the shelter. Now!

5
00:01:40,263 --> 00:01:41,507
- Come on!
- Wait...

6
00:01:41,575 --> 00:01:43,167
Come on, leave it!

7
00:01:44,742 --> 00:01:47,393
Mommy!

8
00:01:48,774 --> 00:01:50,716
Lucy, come on!

9
00:01:52,134 --> 00:01:53,695
- Come on, quickly!
- Run!

10
00:01:53,767 --> 00:01:55,457
Run!

11
00:01:56,934 --> 00:01:59,236
- Hurry!
- Mum!

12
00:01:59,302 --> 00:02:02,051
- Wait! Dad!
- Ed!

13
00:02:02,117 --> 00:02:04,606
- Edmund, no!
- I'll get him!

14
00:02:04,679 --> 00:02:07,907
- Peter, come back!
- Ed! Come here!

15
00:02:07,974 --> 00:02:10,908
Edmund! Get down!

16
00:02:10,982 --> 00:02:13,981
Come on, you idiot, run!

17
00:02:14,053 --> 00:02:15,461
Get out!

18
00:02:20,518 --> 00:02:22,241
Come on!

19
00:02:24,645 --> 00:02:25,889
Hurry!

20
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:29,884
Why can't you think of anyone
but yourself? You're so selfish!

21
00:02:29,957 --> 00:02:32,859
- You could've got us killed!
- Stop it!

22
00:02:32,933 --> 00:02:36,064
It's OK. Shh.

23
00:02:39,877 --> 00:02:42,332
Why can't you just do as you're told?

24
00:02:51,396 --> 00:02:55,041
Alms for the poor.
Alms for the poor.

25
00:02:55,108 --> 00:02:56,385
God bless you, sir.

26
00:02:56,453 --> 00:02:58,558
<i> Children
and evacuation staff...</i>

27
00:02:58,628 --> 00:03:02,339
You need to keep this on, darling.
All right?

28
00:03:02,404 --> 00:03:04,739
You warm enough? Good girl.

29
00:03:04,805 --> 00:03:09,115
Say hello to Auntie Laura.
Goodbye, darling, we love you.

30
00:03:09,637 --> 00:03:11,644
If Dad were here,
he wouldn't make us go.

31
00:03:11,716 --> 00:03:14,683
If Dad were here, it'd mean the war
was over and we wouldn't have to.

32
00:03:14,756 --> 00:03:17,277
You will listen to your brother,
won't you, Edmund?

33
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:34,242
Promise me you'll look after the others.

34
00:03:34,308 --> 00:03:35,803
I will, Mum.

35
00:03:38,532 --> 00:03:43,234
- Good man.
- All aboard! All aboard!

36
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:45,471
- Bye, darling!
- Bye!

37
00:03:45,539 --> 00:03:48,059
Susan.

38
00:03:49,507 --> 00:03:51,896
Be a big girl.

39
00:03:51,971 --> 00:03:55,201
Hold on to your brother's hand.
Don't let it go.

40
00:03:56,131 --> 00:03:59,579
All right. Off you go.

41
00:03:59,651 --> 00:04:03,480
- All aboard!
- Bye-bye. Love you.

42
00:04:07,203 --> 00:04:11,229
Hey, get off. I know
how to get on a train by myself.

43
00:04:11,299 --> 00:04:13,088
Get off me!

44
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:17,340
May I have your tickets, please?
Tickets, please.

45
00:04:17,411 --> 00:04:18,360
Peter.

46
00:04:18,435 --> 00:04:23,071
- That's right. On you go.
- Yes. Thank you.

47
00:04:24,546 --> 00:04:27,808
Come along.
Come along this way, please.

48
00:04:28,642 --> 00:04:31,392
Come on, Lucy.
We have to stick together now.

49
00:04:31,459 --> 00:04:35,649
Everything's gonna be all right.
It's gonna be fine.

50
00:04:35,714 --> 00:04:40,221
Bye, Mommy! I love you!

51
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:55,233
- Bye-bye, dear.
- Bye! We'll miss you! See you soon.

52
00:04:55,298 --> 00:04:57,753
- I love you, Mum! Bye!
- See you soon!

53
00:04:57,826 --> 00:05:00,640
- Write to us, Mum!
- Love you!

54
00:05:57,568 --> 00:06:00,700
Goosey Station. Goosey Station.

55
00:06:06,497 --> 00:06:10,425
Give me your hand. Let's get going.

56
00:07:09,375 --> 00:07:12,474
The professor knew we were coming.

57
00:07:12,543 --> 00:07:15,030
Perhaps we've been incorrectly labeled.

58
00:07:15,103 --> 00:07:17,972
Come on, hup!

59
00:07:22,398 --> 00:07:25,813
And whoa. Whoa.

60
00:07:30,334 --> 00:07:33,563
- Mrs. Macready?
- I'm afraid so.

61
00:07:35,294 --> 00:07:38,709
Is this it, then?
Haven't you brought anything else?

62
00:07:38,782 --> 00:07:40,669
No, ma'am.

63
00:07:41,278 --> 00:07:42,773
It's just us.

64
00:07:43,998 --> 00:07:46,715
Small favors.

65
00:07:47,709 --> 00:07:52,499
Come on.
Good girl. Come on. Come on.

66
00:08:05,597 --> 00:08:09,787
Professor Kirke is not accustomed
to havin' children in this house.

67
00:08:09,854 --> 00:08:13,782
And, as such, there are a few rules
we need to follow.

68
00:08:13,854 --> 00:08:15,795
There will no shoutin'.

69
00:08:15,869 --> 00:08:20,026
Or runnin'.
No improper use of the dumbwaiter.

70
00:08:20,093 --> 00:08:22,962
No touchin' of the historical artifacts!

71
00:08:25,725 --> 00:08:27,514
And above all,

72
00:08:27,581 --> 00:08:32,632
there shall be no disturbin'
of the professor.

73
00:08:41,116 --> 00:08:43,986
<i> German aircraft
carried out a number of attacks</i>

74
00:08:44,061 --> 00:08:45,587
<i>on Great Britain last night.</i>

75
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:47,897
<i>The raids, which lasted
for several hours...</i>

76
00:08:53,628 --> 00:08:56,084
The sheets feel scratchy.

77
00:08:56,732 --> 00:09:00,987
Wars don't last forever, Lucy.
We'll be home soon.

78
00:09:01,052 --> 00:09:04,598
- Yeah, if home's still there.
- Isn't it time you were in bed?

79
00:09:04,668 --> 00:09:06,937
- Yes, Mum.
- Ed!

80
00:09:08,732 --> 00:09:12,888
You saw outside.
This place is huge.

81
00:09:12,956 --> 00:09:14,898
We can do whatever we want here.

82
00:09:14,972 --> 00:09:17,361
Tomorrow's going to be great.

83
00:09:18,236 --> 00:09:19,577
Really.

84
00:09:24,092 --> 00:09:27,736
"Gastrovascular."

85
00:09:29,467 --> 00:09:32,282
Come on, Peter. Gastrovascular.

86
00:09:32,347 --> 00:09:35,478
- Is it Latin?
- Yes.

87
00:09:35,547 --> 00:09:39,159
Is it Latin for
"worst game ever invented"?

88
00:09:41,243 --> 00:09:43,610
We could play hide and seek.

89
00:09:44,827 --> 00:09:47,761
But we're already having so much fun.

90
00:09:48,571 --> 00:09:51,538
Come on, Peter, please.

91
00:09:51,611 --> 00:09:53,977
Pretty please?

92
00:09:54,426 --> 00:09:58,736
- One, two, three, four...
- What?

93
00:10:00,794 --> 00:10:03,512
...five, six, seven, eight,

94
00:10:03,579 --> 00:10:07,190
nine, ten, 11...

95
00:10:18,522 --> 00:10:21,271
...24, 25, 26...

96
00:10:36,409 --> 00:10:37,620
I was here first!

97
00:11:37,112 --> 00:11:42,415
... 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80,

98
00:11:42,489 --> 00:11:47,278
81, 82, 83, 84,

99
00:11:47,351 --> 00:11:51,246
85, 86, 85, 86, 87, 88...

100
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:55,444
...89, 90, 91, 92,

101
00:11:55,512 --> 00:11:59,025
93, 94, 95...

102
00:14:44,468 --> 00:14:46,770
Were you hiding from me?

103
00:14:50,963 --> 00:14:52,393
No.

104
00:14:52,468 --> 00:14:54,354
Uh, well...

105
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:57,131
I just... I...

106
00:14:57,204 --> 00:14:59,921
No. No. I-I-I just...

107
00:14:59,988 --> 00:15:02,770
I was just, um...
I didn't want to scare you.

108
00:15:04,916 --> 00:15:09,552
If you don't mind my asking...
what are you?

109
00:15:09,619 --> 00:15:12,914
Well, I'm a...
Well, I'm a faun.

110
00:15:12,978 --> 00:15:14,320
And what about you?

111
00:15:14,388 --> 00:15:17,486
You must be some kind of
beardless dwarf?

112
00:15:17,555 --> 00:15:20,424
I'm not a dwarf! I'm a girl!

113
00:15:22,163 --> 00:15:26,419
And, actually, I'm tallest in my class.

114
00:15:30,323 --> 00:15:32,875
You mean to say that
you're a Daughter of Eve?

115
00:15:32,946 --> 00:15:35,086
Well, my mum's name is Helen.

116
00:15:35,156 --> 00:15:39,759
Yes, but you are in fact human.

117
00:15:39,826 --> 00:15:42,609
Yes, of course.

118
00:15:44,178 --> 00:15:45,772
What are you doing here?

119
00:15:45,843 --> 00:15:49,323
Well, I was hiding in the wardrobe
in the spare room, and...

120
00:15:49,395 --> 00:15:51,434
Spare Oom? Is that in Narnia?

121
00:15:51,506 --> 00:15:53,874
Narnia? What's that?

122
00:15:54,898 --> 00:15:57,354
Well, dear girl,
you're in it.

123
00:15:57,427 --> 00:15:59,728
Everything from the lamppost

124
00:15:59,794 --> 00:16:03,110
all the way to Castle Cair Paravel
on the Eastern Ocean,

125
00:16:03,186 --> 00:16:05,772
every stick and stone you see,

126
00:16:05,842 --> 00:16:09,323
every icicle is Narnia.

127
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:14,119
This is an awfully big wardrobe.

128
00:16:14,194 --> 00:16:16,878
War Drobe? I'm sorry.

129
00:16:16,946 --> 00:16:20,720
Please allow me to introduce myself.
My name is Tumnus.

130
00:16:20,786 --> 00:16:24,582
Pleased to meet you, Mr. Tumnus.
I'm Lucy Pevensie.

131
00:16:28,242 --> 00:16:32,333
- Oh, you shake it.
- Uh... Why?

132
00:16:33,073 --> 00:16:36,073
I... I don't know.

133
00:16:36,145 --> 00:16:38,316
People do it when they meet each other.

134
00:16:46,385 --> 00:16:51,470
Well, then, Lucy Pevensie
from the shining city of War Drobe

135
00:16:51,537 --> 00:16:54,352
in the wondrous land of Spare Oom,

136
00:16:54,417 --> 00:16:59,022
how would it be if you came
and had tea with me?

137
00:16:59,089 --> 00:17:01,739
Well, thank you very much, but I...

138
00:17:03,056 --> 00:17:05,293
I probably should be getting back.

139
00:17:05,361 --> 00:17:09,801
It's only just around the corner.
And there'll be a glorious fire

140
00:17:09,873 --> 00:17:13,222
with toast and tea and cakes.

141
00:17:13,297 --> 00:17:16,645
And, perhaps, we'll even
break into the sardines.

142
00:17:17,521 --> 00:17:20,750
- I don't know.
- Come on.

143
00:17:20,816 --> 00:17:23,849
It's not every day
that I get to make a new friend.

144
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:29,136
Well, I suppose I could come
for a little while.

145
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,541
If you have sardines.

146
00:17:31,536 --> 00:17:33,227
By the bucketload.

147
00:17:44,464 --> 00:17:46,798
- You all right?
- Mm-hm.

148
00:17:53,967 --> 00:17:55,429
Well, here we are.

149
00:17:55,504 --> 00:17:57,642
Come along.

150
00:18:03,472 --> 00:18:05,610
- After you.
- May I help you with that?

151
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:08,362
- Thank you very much.
- Oh.

152
00:18:16,367 --> 00:18:18,255
Oh.

153
00:18:24,878 --> 00:18:27,017
Now, that... that is my father.

154
00:18:28,206 --> 00:18:30,279
He has a nice face.

155
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:32,419
He looks a lot like you.

156
00:18:33,807 --> 00:18:35,465
No.

157
00:18:35,534 --> 00:18:38,348
No, I'm not very much
like him at all, really.

158
00:18:38,414 --> 00:18:41,710
My father's fighting in the war.

159
00:18:43,246 --> 00:18:46,377
My father went away to war too.

160
00:18:47,151 --> 00:18:50,150
But that was a long, long time ago.

161
00:18:50,574 --> 00:18:54,284
- Before this dreadful winter.
- Winter's not all bad.

162
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:58,692
There's ice skating and snowball fights.

163
00:18:58,766 --> 00:19:02,508
- Oh! And Christmas!
- Not here.

164
00:19:02,574 --> 00:19:07,331
No. No, we haven't had a Christmas
in a hundred years.

165
00:19:07,406 --> 00:19:11,018
What? No presents for a hundred years?

166
00:19:11,086 --> 00:19:13,452
Always winter, never Christmas.

167
00:19:13,518 --> 00:19:16,300
It's been a long winter.

168
00:19:16,973 --> 00:19:20,322
But you would have loved Narnia
in summer.

169
00:19:21,037 --> 00:19:24,518
We fauns danced
with the dryads all night,

170
00:19:24,589 --> 00:19:28,386
and, you know, we never got tired.

171
00:19:28,461 --> 00:19:33,218
And music. Oh, such music!

172
00:19:34,221 --> 00:19:37,517
Would... would you
like to hear some now?

173
00:19:38,349 --> 00:19:41,000
Oh! Yes, please.

174
00:19:44,717 --> 00:19:47,978
Now, are you familiar

175
00:19:48,044 --> 00:19:51,786
- with any Narnian lullabies?
- Sorry, no.

176
00:19:51,853 --> 00:19:53,926
Well, that's good.

177
00:19:54,156 --> 00:19:58,913
Because this... probably
won't sound anything like one.

178
00:21:20,427 --> 00:21:22,914
- Oh, I should go.
- It's too late for that now.

179
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:26,857
I'm such a terrible faun.

180
00:21:30,090 --> 00:21:32,327
Oh, no.

181
00:21:32,395 --> 00:21:35,045
You're the nicest faun I've ever met.

182
00:21:35,114 --> 00:21:38,562
Then I'm afraid you've had
a very poor sampling.

183
00:21:38,635 --> 00:21:42,977
No. You can't have done
anything that bad.

184
00:21:44,842 --> 00:21:48,933
It's not something I have done,
Lucy Pevensie.

185
00:21:49,482 --> 00:21:51,522
It's something I am doing.

186
00:21:51,594 --> 00:21:53,252
What are you doing?

187
00:21:53,994 --> 00:21:57,474
I'm kidnapping you.

188
00:21:57,545 --> 00:21:59,204
It was the White Witch.

189
00:21:59,274 --> 00:22:01,695
She's the one who makes it
always winter, always cold.

190
00:22:01,770 --> 00:22:03,265
She gave orders.

191
00:22:03,338 --> 00:22:06,535
If any of us ever find a human
wandering in the woods,

192
00:22:06,602 --> 00:22:08,870
we're supposed to turn it over to her.

193
00:22:09,609 --> 00:22:12,391
But, Mr. Tumnus, you wouldn't.

194
00:22:17,130 --> 00:22:20,129
I thought you were my friend.

195
00:22:23,817 --> 00:22:27,232
Now. She may already know you're here.

196
00:22:27,305 --> 00:22:29,891
The woods are full of her spies.

197
00:22:32,361 --> 00:22:35,208
Even some of the trees are on her side.

198
00:22:39,016 --> 00:22:41,569
Can you find your way back from here?

199
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:44,674
- I think so.
- All right.

200
00:22:47,785 --> 00:22:51,462
Will you be all right?

201
00:22:52,137 --> 00:22:55,235
Hey, hey, hey.

202
00:22:55,304 --> 00:22:58,981
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

203
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:03,044
Here.

204
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:08,254
Keep it. You need it more than I do.

205
00:23:11,753 --> 00:23:13,924
No matter what happens,
Lucy Pevensie,

206
00:23:13,992 --> 00:23:16,358
I am glad to have met you.

207
00:23:16,423 --> 00:23:19,391
You've made me feel warmer
than I've felt in a hundred years.

208
00:23:21,032 --> 00:23:22,494
Now go.

209
00:23:22,568 --> 00:23:24,061
Go!

210
00:23:33,479 --> 00:23:36,414
... 99, 100.

211
00:23:36,487 --> 00:23:37,797
Ready or not, here I come!

212
00:23:37,864 --> 00:23:40,995
It's all right! I'm back! I'm all right!

213
00:23:41,063 --> 00:23:43,364
Shut up! He's coming!

214
00:23:46,951 --> 00:23:50,246
You know, I'm not sure you two
have quite got the idea of this game.

215
00:23:50,310 --> 00:23:52,732
Weren't you wondering where I was?

216
00:23:52,807 --> 00:23:55,873
That's the point.
That was why he was seeking you.

217
00:23:55,943 --> 00:23:57,253
Does this mean I win?

218
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:59,392
I don't think Lucy
wants to play anymore.

219
00:23:59,463 --> 00:24:01,851
I've been gone for hours.

220
00:24:15,622 --> 00:24:18,524
Lucy, the only wood in here
is the back of the wardrobe.

221
00:24:18,598 --> 00:24:22,624
One game at a time, Lu.
We don't all have your imagination.

222
00:24:26,375 --> 00:24:29,374
But I wasn't imagining!

223
00:24:29,446 --> 00:24:31,105
That's enough, Lucy.

224
00:24:31,175 --> 00:24:33,509
I wouldn't lie about this!

225
00:24:33,574 --> 00:24:35,233
Well, I believe you.

226
00:24:36,037 --> 00:24:38,427
- You do?
- Yeah, of course.

227
00:24:38,503 --> 00:24:40,957
Didn't I tell you about
the field in the cupboards?

228
00:24:41,030 --> 00:24:43,103
Will you just stop?

229
00:24:43,173 --> 00:24:45,694
You just have to make
everything worse, don't you?

230
00:24:45,766 --> 00:24:48,581
- It was just a joke!
- When are you gonna learn to grow up?

231
00:24:48,646 --> 00:24:51,809
Shut up! You think you're Dad,
but you're not!

232
00:24:55,205 --> 00:24:57,627
Well, that was nicely handled.

233
00:24:59,429 --> 00:25:03,553
But... it really was there.

234
00:25:03,621 --> 00:25:06,555
Susan's right, Lucy.

235
00:25:06,629 --> 00:25:08,484
That's enough.

236
00:26:40,323 --> 00:26:42,111
Lucy.

237
00:26:42,883 --> 00:26:44,890
Where are you?

238
00:26:47,171 --> 00:26:48,697
Boo!

239
00:26:55,203 --> 00:26:57,112
Lucy.

240
00:26:58,883 --> 00:27:01,217
Hope you're not afraid of the dark.

241
00:27:06,979 --> 00:27:08,571
Lucy?

242
00:27:13,955 --> 00:27:15,743
Lucy?

243
00:27:17,154 --> 00:27:18,681
Lucy!

244
00:27:36,418 --> 00:27:38,206
Lucy.

245
00:27:39,137 --> 00:27:40,992
Where are you?

246
00:27:42,562 --> 00:27:44,220
Lucy.

247
00:27:45,282 --> 00:27:47,616
I think I believe you now.

248
00:28:12,384 --> 00:28:13,977
Lucy.

249
00:28:30,176 --> 00:28:31,354
Lucy?

250
00:28:37,729 --> 00:28:38,939
Oh!

251
00:28:59,616 --> 00:29:02,103
- Leave me alone!
- What is it now, Ginarrbrik?

252
00:29:02,175 --> 00:29:04,347
Make him let me go!
I didn't do anything wrong!

253
00:29:04,416 --> 00:29:06,718
How dare you address
the Queen of Narnia?

254
00:29:06,784 --> 00:29:08,573
I didn't know!

255
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:11,574
- You will know her better hereafter!
- Wait!

256
00:29:21,695 --> 00:29:24,662
What is your name, Son of Adam?

257
00:29:24,734 --> 00:29:26,906
Uh, Edmund.

258
00:29:26,975 --> 00:29:30,903
And how, Edmund,
did you come to enter my dominion?

259
00:29:30,975 --> 00:29:34,805
I'm not sure.
I was just following my sister.

260
00:29:34,879 --> 00:29:38,392
- Your sister? How many are you?
- Four.

261
00:29:38,463 --> 00:29:41,114
Lucy's the only one
that's been here before.

262
00:29:41,183 --> 00:29:44,957
She said she met some faun
called Tumnus.

263
00:29:45,023 --> 00:29:47,957
Peter and Susan didn't believe her.
I didn't either.

264
00:29:48,030 --> 00:29:52,537
Edmund, you look so cold.
Will you come and sit with me?

265
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:10,621
Now, how about something hot to drink?

266
00:30:11,806 --> 00:30:15,319
Yes, please, Your Majesty.

267
00:30:31,614 --> 00:30:34,297
Your drink, sire.

268
00:30:34,365 --> 00:30:36,405
How did you do that?

269
00:30:36,477 --> 00:30:38,452
I can make anything you like.

270
00:30:39,357 --> 00:30:41,778
Can you make me taller?

271
00:30:41,853 --> 00:30:44,755
Anything you'd like to eat.

272
00:30:46,141 --> 00:30:48,280
Turkish delight?

273
00:31:12,733 --> 00:31:14,424
Edmund?

274
00:31:14,493 --> 00:31:17,624
I would very much like to meet
the rest of your family.

275
00:31:17,693 --> 00:31:19,580
Why?

276
00:31:20,125 --> 00:31:22,427
They're nothing special.

277
00:31:22,461 --> 00:31:28,210
Oh, I'm sure they're not nearly
as delightful as you are.

278
00:31:29,692 --> 00:31:33,587
But you see, Edmund,
I have no children of my own.

279
00:31:33,661 --> 00:31:35,548
And you are exactly the sort of boy

280
00:31:35,612 --> 00:31:40,730
who I could see, one day,
becoming Prince of Narnia.

281
00:31:41,052 --> 00:31:43,255
Maybe even King.

282
00:31:44,316 --> 00:31:46,203
Really?

283
00:31:46,907 --> 00:31:49,328
Of course, you'd have
to bring your family.

284
00:31:49,403 --> 00:31:50,647
Oh.

285
00:31:50,716 --> 00:31:54,032
Do you mean,
Peter would be king too?

286
00:31:54,107 --> 00:31:56,596
No! No, no.

287
00:31:57,308 --> 00:32:00,243
But a king needs servants.

288
00:32:01,435 --> 00:32:03,803
I guess I could bring 'em.

289
00:32:07,964 --> 00:32:10,964
Beyond these woods,
you see those two hills?

290
00:32:11,036 --> 00:32:14,069
My house is right between them.

291
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:16,027
You'd love it there, Edmund.

292
00:32:16,091 --> 00:32:20,247
It has whole rooms
simply stuffed with Turkish delight.

293
00:32:20,314 --> 00:32:23,445
- Couldn't I have some more now?
- No!

294
00:32:25,947 --> 00:32:28,183
Don't want to ruin your appetite.

295
00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:31,763
Besides, you and I are going to be
seeing each other again very soon.

296
00:32:31,834 --> 00:32:34,867
I hope so, Your Majesty.

297
00:32:35,674 --> 00:32:39,929
Until then, dear one.
Mmm, I'm gonna miss you.

298
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:44,921
Yah! Yah! Yah!

299
00:32:52,058 --> 00:32:53,717
Edmund?

300
00:32:54,874 --> 00:32:57,558
Oh, Edmund! You got in too!

301
00:32:57,626 --> 00:33:00,179
Isn't it wonderful?

302
00:33:00,250 --> 00:33:04,309
- Where have you been?
- With Mr. Tumnus. He's fine.

303
00:33:04,378 --> 00:33:08,088
The White Witch hasn't found out
anything about him meeting me.

304
00:33:08,154 --> 00:33:09,495
The White Witch?

305
00:33:10,266 --> 00:33:14,041
She calls herself the Queen of Narnia,
but she really isn't.

306
00:33:15,578 --> 00:33:18,612
Are you all right? You look awful.

307
00:33:18,682 --> 00:33:22,456
Well, what'd you expect?
I mean, it's freezing.

308
00:33:22,522 --> 00:33:26,034
- How do we get out of here?
- Come on.

309
00:33:26,105 --> 00:33:27,666
This way.

310
00:33:29,753 --> 00:33:32,142
Peter, Peter, wake up!
Peter, wake up!

311
00:33:32,217 --> 00:33:34,039
- It's there! It's really there!
- Shh.

312
00:33:34,106 --> 00:33:36,855
- Lucy, what are you talking about?
- Narnia!

313
00:33:36,921 --> 00:33:39,191
It's all in the wardrobe
like I told you!

314
00:33:39,258 --> 00:33:42,225
- You've just been dreaming, Lucy.
- But I haven't!

315
00:33:42,298 --> 00:33:46,127
I saw Mr. Tumnus again!
And this time Edmund went too.

316
00:33:49,177 --> 00:33:52,341
You... You saw the faun?

317
00:33:55,256 --> 00:33:58,868
Well, he didn't actually
go there with me.

318
00:33:59,192 --> 00:34:01,713
He...

319
00:34:04,633 --> 00:34:06,607
What were you doing, Edmund?

320
00:34:09,017 --> 00:34:11,056
I was just playing along.

321
00:34:12,217 --> 00:34:13,646
I'm sorry, Peter.

322
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:16,055
I shouldn't have encouraged her,

323
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:18,935
but you know what little children
are like these days.

324
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,480
They just don't know
when to stop pretending.

325
00:34:29,015 --> 00:34:30,609
Ow!

326
00:34:31,448 --> 00:34:34,165
Oh!

327
00:34:39,576 --> 00:34:43,089
You children are one shenanigan
shy of sleepin' in the stable!

328
00:34:44,119 --> 00:34:49,836
Professor. I'm sorry. I told them
you were not to be disturbed.

329
00:34:49,911 --> 00:34:53,107
It's all right, Mrs. Macready.
I'm sure there's an explanation.

330
00:34:54,328 --> 00:34:57,491
But first of all, I think this one
is in need of a little hot chocolate.

331
00:34:57,559 --> 00:35:00,755
Come along, dear.

332
00:35:07,607 --> 00:35:12,014
You seem to have upset the delicate
internal balance of my housekeeper.

333
00:35:12,087 --> 00:35:14,804
We're very sorry, sir.
It won't happen again.

334
00:35:14,870 --> 00:35:17,172
It's our sister, sir. Lucy.

335
00:35:17,239 --> 00:35:20,206
- The weeping girl.
- Yes, sir.

336
00:35:20,278 --> 00:35:23,125
- She's upset.
- Hence the weeping.

337
00:35:23,191 --> 00:35:24,565
It's nothing.

338
00:35:24,631 --> 00:35:27,412
- We can handle it.
- Oh, I can see that.

339
00:35:29,207 --> 00:35:31,825
She thinks she's found a magical land.

340
00:35:31,895 --> 00:35:34,644
In the upstairs wardrobe.

341
00:35:36,535 --> 00:35:38,193
What did you say?

342
00:35:38,262 --> 00:35:42,385
Um, the wardrobe, upstairs.

343
00:35:42,455 --> 00:35:44,822
Lucy thinks she's found a forest inside.

344
00:35:44,886 --> 00:35:46,991
She won't stop going on about it.

345
00:35:47,862 --> 00:35:51,277
- What was it like?
- Like talking to a lunatic.

346
00:35:51,350 --> 00:35:53,738
No, no, no, not her.
The forest.

347
00:35:53,814 --> 00:35:57,130
- You're not saying you believe her?
- You don't?

348
00:35:57,206 --> 00:35:58,613
But of course not.

349
00:35:58,678 --> 00:36:01,099
I mean, logically, it's impossible.

350
00:36:01,174 --> 00:36:03,924
What do they teach in schools
these days?

351
00:36:03,989 --> 00:36:05,844
Edmund said they were only pretending.

352
00:36:05,909 --> 00:36:07,884
He's usually the more
truthful one, is he?

353
00:36:07,957 --> 00:36:11,699
No. This would be the first time.

354
00:36:11,765 --> 00:36:13,772
Well, if she's not mad
and she's not lying,

355
00:36:13,845 --> 00:36:18,188
then logically we must assume
she's telling the truth.

356
00:36:18,614 --> 00:36:21,680
You're saying that we
should just believe her?

357
00:36:23,157 --> 00:36:27,085
She's your sister, isn't she?
You're her family.

358
00:36:29,141 --> 00:36:31,857
You might just try acting like one.

359
00:36:32,373 --> 00:36:36,235
Peter winds up,
poised to take yet another wicket!

360
00:36:36,309 --> 00:36:37,903
Ow!

361
00:36:37,974 --> 00:36:41,651
Whoops! Wake up, Dolly Daydream.

362
00:36:42,452 --> 00:36:44,525
Why can't we play hide and seek again?

363
00:36:44,597 --> 00:36:47,117
I thought you said it was a kid's game.

364
00:36:47,188 --> 00:36:51,411
Besides, we could all use the fresh air.

365
00:36:51,476 --> 00:36:54,094
It's not like there isn't air inside.

366
00:36:55,253 --> 00:36:58,668
- Are you ready?
- Are you?

367
00:37:14,164 --> 00:37:16,498
- Well done, Ed.
- You bowled it!

368
00:37:16,564 --> 00:37:19,379
- What on earth is goin' on?
- The Macready!

369
00:37:19,444 --> 00:37:21,004
Come on!

370
00:37:28,211 --> 00:37:30,099
No, no, back, back, back!

371
00:37:55,475 --> 00:37:59,152
- Come on!
- Oh, you've got to be joking.

372
00:38:10,931 --> 00:38:12,043
Get back!

373
00:38:12,083 --> 00:38:14,930
- My toe!
- I'm not on your toe!

374
00:38:14,994 --> 00:38:17,711
- Move back.
- Will you stop shoving?

375
00:38:28,946 --> 00:38:32,045
Impossible.

376
00:38:34,130 --> 00:38:35,538
Don't worry.

377
00:38:35,603 --> 00:38:38,952
I'm sure it's just your imagination.

378
00:38:39,027 --> 00:38:42,060
I don't suppose
saying we're sorry

379
00:38:42,130 --> 00:38:45,293
- would quite cover it.
- No. It wouldn't.

380
00:38:47,953 --> 00:38:50,125
- But that might!
- Oh!

381
00:38:52,658 --> 00:38:55,047
Oh!

382
00:38:57,426 --> 00:38:58,921
Ow!

383
00:38:59,665 --> 00:39:01,454
Stop it!

384
00:39:02,642 --> 00:39:04,397
You little liar.

385
00:39:04,465 --> 00:39:08,524
- You didn't believe her, either.
- Apologize to Lucy.

386
00:39:09,810 --> 00:39:13,388
- Say you're sorry.
- All right! I'm sorry.

387
00:39:13,457 --> 00:39:15,344
That's all right.

388
00:39:15,409 --> 00:39:18,278
Some children just don't know
when to stop pretending.

389
00:39:18,352 --> 00:39:19,760
Oh, very funny.

390
00:39:19,825 --> 00:39:21,614
Maybe we should go back.

391
00:39:21,682 --> 00:39:25,031
But shouldn't we at least
take a look around?

392
00:39:25,106 --> 00:39:26,763
I think Lucy should decide.

393
00:39:28,273 --> 00:39:31,339
I'd like you all to meet Mr. Tumnus!

394
00:39:31,409 --> 00:39:33,513
Well, then Mr. Tumnus it is.

395
00:39:34,545 --> 00:39:37,774
But we can't go hiking in the snow
dressed like this.

396
00:39:37,841 --> 00:39:38,789
No.

397
00:39:40,593 --> 00:39:44,138
But I'm sure the professor
wouldn't mind us using these.

398
00:39:44,209 --> 00:39:48,366
Anyway, if you think about it logically,

399
00:39:48,432 --> 00:39:50,734
we're not even taking them
out of the wardrobe.

400
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:53,833
- But that's a girl's coat!
- I know.

401
00:40:36,208 --> 00:40:40,169
...lots and lots of lovely food,
and we'll have lots and lots of...

402
00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:44,494
Lu?

403
00:40:46,351 --> 00:40:47,693
Lucy!

404
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:07,529
Who would do something like this?

405
00:41:24,014 --> 00:41:27,330
"The Faun Tumnus is hereby charged

406
00:41:27,405 --> 00:41:31,334
with High Treason
against Her Imperial Majesty,

407
00:41:31,406 --> 00:41:34,254
Jadis, Queen of Narnia,

408
00:41:34,318 --> 00:41:37,482
for comforting her enemies
and fraternizing with humans.

409
00:41:37,550 --> 00:41:40,866
Signed Maugrim,
Captain of the Secret Police.

410
00:41:40,942 --> 00:41:42,981
Long Live the Queen."

411
00:41:44,206 --> 00:41:47,304
All right.
Now we really should go back.

412
00:41:47,373 --> 00:41:48,967
But what about Mr. Tumnus?

413
00:41:49,038 --> 00:41:51,787
If he was arrested just
for being with a human,

414
00:41:51,853 --> 00:41:55,595
- I don't think there's much we can do.
- You don't understand, do you?

415
00:41:56,749 --> 00:41:58,789
I'm the human.

416
00:41:58,862 --> 00:42:01,196
She must have found out
he helped me.

417
00:42:01,262 --> 00:42:04,677
- Maybe we could call the police.
- These are the police.

418
00:42:04,749 --> 00:42:06,888
Don't worry, Lu.
We'll think of something.

419
00:42:06,957 --> 00:42:08,746
Why?

420
00:42:09,357 --> 00:42:10,918
I mean, he's a criminal.

421
00:42:11,373 --> 00:42:13,609
Psst.

422
00:42:15,757 --> 00:42:18,888
Did that bird just "psst" us?

423
00:42:59,724 --> 00:43:02,757
It... It's a beaver.

424
00:43:08,428 --> 00:43:10,370
Here, boy.

425
00:43:10,443 --> 00:43:12,353
Here, boy.

426
00:43:16,044 --> 00:43:19,272
I ain't gonna smell it,
if that's what you want.

427
00:43:19,340 --> 00:43:20,616
Oh.

428
00:43:20,684 --> 00:43:21,992
Sorry.

429
00:43:22,315 --> 00:43:24,869
Lucy Pevensie?

430
00:43:29,258 --> 00:43:30,786
Yes?

431
00:43:39,756 --> 00:43:41,894
Hey, that's the hankie
I gave to Mr. Tum...

432
00:43:41,963 --> 00:43:44,930
Tumnus. He got it to me
just before they took him.

433
00:43:45,003 --> 00:43:46,345
Is he all right?

434
00:43:47,147 --> 00:43:49,034
Further in.

435
00:43:50,859 --> 00:43:53,641
- What are you doing?
- She's right.

436
00:43:53,707 --> 00:43:56,194
How do we know we can trust him?

437
00:43:56,266 --> 00:43:57,925
He said he knows the faun.

438
00:43:57,995 --> 00:44:01,824
He's a beaver.
He shouldn't be saying anything!

439
00:44:01,898 --> 00:44:03,556
Everything all right?

440
00:44:03,626 --> 00:44:05,830
Yes. We were just talking.

441
00:44:05,898 --> 00:44:08,833
That's better left
for safer quarters.

442
00:44:09,867 --> 00:44:11,906
He means the trees.

443
00:44:25,995 --> 00:44:30,020
Come on. We don't want to be
caught out here after nightfall.

444
00:44:43,049 --> 00:44:46,049
Ah, blimey! Looks like the old girl
has got the kettle on.

445
00:44:46,121 --> 00:44:47,747
Nice cup o' Rosy Lee.

446
00:44:47,818 --> 00:44:50,403
- It's lovely.
- It's merely a trifle.

447
00:44:50,473 --> 00:44:52,709
Still plenty to do.
Ain't quite finished it yet.

448
00:44:52,776 --> 00:44:54,601
It'll look the business
when it is, though.

449
00:44:56,138 --> 00:44:59,334
Beaver, is that you?
I've been worried sick!

450
00:44:59,401 --> 00:45:02,019
If I find you've been
out with Badger again, I...

451
00:45:02,857 --> 00:45:04,068
Oh!

452
00:45:04,137 --> 00:45:06,341
Well, those aren't badgers.

453
00:45:06,409 --> 00:45:10,882
Oh, I never thought
I'd live to see this day.

454
00:45:11,721 --> 00:45:15,017
Look at my fur. You couldn't
give me ten minutes warning?

455
00:45:15,081 --> 00:45:17,536
I'd have given a week
if I thought it would've helped.

456
00:45:17,609 --> 00:45:19,518
Oh, come inside,

457
00:45:19,592 --> 00:45:21,698
and we'll see if we
can't get you some food,

458
00:45:21,769 --> 00:45:26,024
and some civilized company.

459
00:45:26,089 --> 00:45:28,292
Now, careful. Watch your step.

460
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:29,887
Excuse the mess.

461
00:45:29,961 --> 00:45:32,895
Can't get Mr. Beaver
to get out of his chair.

462
00:45:36,936 --> 00:45:39,423
Enjoyin' the scenery, are we?

463
00:45:43,047 --> 00:45:45,666
Isn't there anything
we can do to help Tumnus?

464
00:45:45,736 --> 00:45:48,703
They'll have taken him to the Witch's.
You know what they say.

465
00:45:48,776 --> 00:45:52,486
There's few that go through
them gates that come out again.

466
00:45:52,552 --> 00:45:54,940
Fish 'n' chips?

467
00:45:55,527 --> 00:45:59,008
But there is hope, dear.
Lots of hope.

468
00:45:59,079 --> 00:46:02,341
Oh, yeah,
there's a right bit more than hope!

469
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:06,022
Aslan is on the move.

470
00:46:12,743 --> 00:46:13,954
Who's Aslan?

471
00:46:14,023 --> 00:46:16,805
Who's Aslan?

472
00:46:16,871 --> 00:46:19,741
You cheeky little blighter.

473
00:46:21,383 --> 00:46:22,627
What?

474
00:46:25,063 --> 00:46:28,379
- You don't know, do you?
- We haven't exactly been here long.

475
00:46:28,455 --> 00:46:30,757
Well, he's only the king
of the whole wood.

476
00:46:30,823 --> 00:46:34,238
The top geezer.
The real King of Narnia.

477
00:46:34,311 --> 00:46:38,086
- He's been away for a long while.
- But he's just got back!

478
00:46:38,151 --> 00:46:40,834
And he's waitin' for you
near the Stone Table!

479
00:46:40,902 --> 00:46:43,837
- He's waiting for us?
- You're bloomin' joking!

480
00:46:43,910 --> 00:46:46,399
They don't even know about the prophecy!

481
00:46:46,471 --> 00:46:50,148
- Well, then...
- Look.

482
00:46:50,215 --> 00:46:52,319
Aslan's return,

483
00:46:52,390 --> 00:46:55,554
Tumnus' arrest, the secret police,

484
00:46:55,622 --> 00:46:57,662
it's all happening because of you!

485
00:46:57,734 --> 00:47:00,996
- You're blaming us?
- No! Not blaming.

486
00:47:01,062 --> 00:47:04,772
- Thanking you.
- There's a prophecy.

487
00:47:04,839 --> 00:47:07,621
"When Adam's flesh and Adam's bone

488
00:47:07,686 --> 00:47:10,620
sits at Cair Paravel in throne,

489
00:47:10,694 --> 00:47:13,248
the evil time will be over and done."

490
00:47:13,319 --> 00:47:15,555
- That doesn't really rhyme.
- I know it don't.

491
00:47:15,622 --> 00:47:17,825
You're kinda missin' the point!

492
00:47:17,893 --> 00:47:20,228
It has long been foretold

493
00:47:20,294 --> 00:47:22,912
that two Sons of Adam
and two Daughters of Eve

494
00:47:22,982 --> 00:47:28,034
will defeat the White Witch
and restore peace to Narnia.

495
00:47:30,310 --> 00:47:31,772
And you think we're the ones?

496
00:47:31,846 --> 00:47:34,747
You'd better be, 'cause Aslan's
already fitted out your army.

497
00:47:34,821 --> 00:47:36,708
- Our army?
- Mum sent us away

498
00:47:36,773 --> 00:47:39,524
so we wouldn't get
caught up in a war.

499
00:47:40,261 --> 00:47:42,945
I think you've made a mistake.

500
00:47:43,013 --> 00:47:45,795
- We're not heroes.
- We're from Finchley.

501
00:47:46,789 --> 00:47:47,868
Hmm.

502
00:47:47,941 --> 00:47:50,909
Thank you for your hospitality.

503
00:47:51,844 --> 00:47:55,325
- But we really have to go.
- No, you can't just leave!

504
00:47:55,396 --> 00:47:58,910
He's right.
We have to help Mr. Tumnus.

505
00:47:58,981 --> 00:48:01,402
It's out of our hands.

506
00:48:01,477 --> 00:48:02,851
I'm sorry,

507
00:48:02,916 --> 00:48:06,015
but it's time the four of us
were getting home. Ed?

508
00:48:08,453 --> 00:48:10,079
Ed?

509
00:48:12,037 --> 00:48:15,266
- I'm gonna kill him.
- You may not have to.

510
00:48:15,332 --> 00:48:18,234
Has Edmund ever been to Narnia before?

511
00:48:43,908 --> 00:48:45,151
Hurry!

512
00:49:04,707 --> 00:49:07,228
- Edmund!
- Shh! They'll hear you!

513
00:49:08,355 --> 00:49:09,468
No!

514
00:49:09,540 --> 00:49:11,873
- Get off!
- You're playing into her hands.

515
00:49:11,939 --> 00:49:14,274
- We can't just let him go!
- He's our brother!

516
00:49:14,340 --> 00:49:17,274
He's the bait!
The Witch wants all four of you!

517
00:49:17,347 --> 00:49:21,089
- Why?
- To stop the prophecy from coming true.

518
00:49:21,155 --> 00:49:22,497
To kill you!

519
00:49:32,067 --> 00:49:35,198
- This is all your fault.
- My fault?

520
00:49:35,266 --> 00:49:38,200
None of this would have happened
if you had listened to me!

521
00:49:38,274 --> 00:49:40,413
- You knew this would happen.
- I didn't know.

522
00:49:40,482 --> 00:49:43,002
Which is why we should
have left while we could!

523
00:49:43,074 --> 00:49:44,057
Stop it!

524
00:49:45,155 --> 00:49:48,767
- This isn't going to help Edmund.
- She's right.

525
00:49:48,835 --> 00:49:51,868
Only Aslan can help your brother now.

526
00:49:53,474 --> 00:49:55,034
Then take us to him.

527
00:51:02,272 --> 00:51:05,175
Be still, stranger,
or you'll never move again.

528
00:51:05,696 --> 00:51:07,290
- Who are you?
- I'm Edmund!

529
00:51:07,361 --> 00:51:10,841
I met the Queen in the woods!
She told me to come back here!

530
00:51:10,912 --> 00:51:12,319
I'm a Son of Adam!

531
00:51:12,384 --> 00:51:17,206
Hmm. My apologies,
fortunate favorite of the queen.

532
00:51:17,279 --> 00:51:20,477
Or else, not so fortunate.

533
00:51:24,576 --> 00:51:26,332
Right this way.

534
00:51:46,592 --> 00:51:48,314
Wait here.

535
00:52:25,983 --> 00:52:27,095
Like it?

536
00:52:27,166 --> 00:52:31,901
Uh... Yes, Your Majesty.

537
00:52:34,238 --> 00:52:36,278
I thought you might.

538
00:52:38,238 --> 00:52:39,897
Tell me, Edmund...

539
00:52:42,526 --> 00:52:44,500
Are your sisters deaf?

540
00:52:44,574 --> 00:52:46,200
No.

541
00:52:46,270 --> 00:52:49,019
And your brother, is he...

542
00:52:50,814 --> 00:52:52,668
...unintelligent?

543
00:52:52,734 --> 00:52:55,068
Well, I think so.
But Mum says...

544
00:52:55,135 --> 00:52:59,095
Then how dare you come alone?!

545
00:52:59,166 --> 00:53:01,784
- I tried!
- Edmund, I asked so little of you.

546
00:53:01,854 --> 00:53:04,636
- They just don't listen to me!
- You couldn't even do that.

547
00:53:04,701 --> 00:53:06,131
I did bring them halfway.

548
00:53:06,205 --> 00:53:08,791
They're at the little house at the dam
with the Beavers.

549
00:53:15,677 --> 00:53:17,532
Well.

550
00:53:17,598 --> 00:53:21,372
I suppose you're not
a total loss then, are you?

551
00:53:23,997 --> 00:53:25,852
Well, I was wondering,

552
00:53:26,781 --> 00:53:31,636
could I maybe have some more
Turkish delight now?

553
00:53:36,925 --> 00:53:38,932
Our guest is hungry.

554
00:53:45,309 --> 00:53:48,658
This way for your num-nums.

555
00:53:50,684 --> 00:53:53,531
Maugrim?

556
00:53:55,389 --> 00:53:57,428
You know what to do.

557
00:54:22,524 --> 00:54:23,750
Hurry, Mother! They're after us!

558
00:54:23,784 --> 00:54:24,977
Hurry, Mother! They're after us!

559
00:54:25,052 --> 00:54:27,899
- Oh, right then.
- What's she doing?

560
00:54:28,571 --> 00:54:30,230
Oh, you'll be thanking me later.

561
00:54:30,300 --> 00:54:33,561
It's a long journey and Beaver
gets pretty cranky when he's hungry.

562
00:54:33,628 --> 00:54:35,089
I'm cranky now!

563
00:54:37,211 --> 00:54:38,455
Take them.

564
00:54:41,820 --> 00:54:45,168
- Do you think we'll need jam?
- Only if the Witch serves toast.

565
00:54:59,771 --> 00:55:00,754
Hurry.

566
00:55:15,579 --> 00:55:18,775
Badger and me dug this.
Comes out right near his place.

567
00:55:18,842 --> 00:55:21,013
You told me
it led to your mum's!

568
00:55:21,658 --> 00:55:23,000
Lucy!

569
00:55:24,537 --> 00:55:25,967
They're in the tunnel.

570
00:55:26,043 --> 00:55:28,944
- Quick! This way.
- Hurry!

571
00:55:30,106 --> 00:55:32,211
- Run!
- Quick! Quick! Quick!

572
00:55:40,186 --> 00:55:42,074
You should have brought a map!

573
00:55:42,138 --> 00:55:44,756
There wasn't room next to the jam.

574
00:55:51,321 --> 00:55:53,688
Come on, Lucy!

575
00:56:12,249 --> 00:56:15,445
I'm so sorry, dear.

576
00:56:15,513 --> 00:56:17,684
He was my best mate.

577
00:56:26,553 --> 00:56:27,763
What happened here?

578
00:56:27,833 --> 00:56:30,550
This is what becomes
of those who cross the Witch.

579
00:56:30,617 --> 00:56:34,229
You take one more step, traitor,
and I'll chew you to splinters!

580
00:56:34,297 --> 00:56:37,046
Relax. I'm one of the good guys.

581
00:56:37,112 --> 00:56:41,007
Yeah? Well, you look an awful lot
like one of the bad ones.

582
00:56:41,081 --> 00:56:43,318
An unfortunate family resemblance.

583
00:56:43,385 --> 00:56:46,483
But we can argue breeding later.
Right now we've got to move.

584
00:56:47,896 --> 00:56:49,839
What did you have in mind?

585
00:56:57,080 --> 00:56:58,673
Greetings, gents.

586
00:56:59,416 --> 00:57:02,646
- Lost something, have we?
- Don't patronize me!

587
00:57:02,712 --> 00:57:05,297
I know where your allegiance lies.

588
00:57:05,368 --> 00:57:08,434
We're looking for some humans.

589
00:57:08,504 --> 00:57:10,740
Humans? Here in Narnia?

590
00:57:10,807 --> 00:57:13,491
That's a valuable bit of information,
don't you think?

591
00:57:15,320 --> 00:57:17,557
Your reward is your life.

592
00:57:17,624 --> 00:57:19,990
It's not much,

593
00:57:20,728 --> 00:57:22,134
but still.

594
00:57:22,743 --> 00:57:24,718
Where are the fugitives?

595
00:57:31,383 --> 00:57:34,252
North. They ran north.

596
00:57:35,127 --> 00:57:37,037
Smell them out.

597
00:57:46,903 --> 00:57:50,678
They were helping Tumnus.
The Witch got here before I did.

598
00:57:50,743 --> 00:57:53,263
Ow! Oh!

599
00:57:53,334 --> 00:57:54,709
Are you all right?

600
00:57:54,775 --> 00:57:57,808
Well, I wish I could say their bark
was worse than their bite. Ow!

601
00:57:57,879 --> 00:58:02,134
Stop squirming!
You're worse than Beaver on bath day.

602
00:58:02,199 --> 00:58:03,628
Worst day of the year.

603
00:58:03,703 --> 00:58:06,124
Thank you for your kindness,

604
00:58:06,199 --> 00:58:08,238
but that's all the cure I have time for.

605
00:58:08,310 --> 00:58:09,259
You're leaving?

606
00:58:09,334 --> 00:58:12,782
It has been a pleasure, My Queen,
and an honor, but time is short

607
00:58:12,854 --> 00:58:15,887
and Aslan himself has asked me
to gather more troops.

608
00:58:15,958 --> 00:58:19,635
- You've seen Aslan?
- What's he like?

609
00:58:19,702 --> 00:58:22,670
Like everything we've ever heard.

610
00:58:22,742 --> 00:58:26,124
You'll be glad to have him by your side
in the battle against the Witch.

611
00:58:26,198 --> 00:58:28,881
But we're not planning
on fighting any witch.

612
00:58:28,950 --> 00:58:31,633
But surely, King Peter, the prophecy!

613
00:58:31,702 --> 00:58:33,775
We can't go to war without you.

614
00:58:39,061 --> 00:58:41,265
We just want our brother back.

615
00:59:05,077 --> 00:59:06,638
If...

616
00:59:08,054 --> 00:59:10,923
If you're not going to eat that...

617
00:59:16,116 --> 00:59:19,052
I'd get up, but...

618
00:59:19,125 --> 00:59:21,296
...but my legs.

619
00:59:29,973 --> 00:59:33,136
Mr. Tumnus.

620
00:59:34,613 --> 00:59:36,500
What's left of him.

621
00:59:42,708 --> 00:59:46,418
- You're Lucy Pevensie's brother.
- I'm Edmund.

622
00:59:47,508 --> 00:59:50,639
Yes. Yes, you have the same nose.

623
00:59:54,932 --> 00:59:56,623
Is your sister all right?

624
00:59:59,091 --> 01:00:00,586
Is she safe?

625
01:00:04,308 --> 01:00:06,282
I don't know.

626
01:00:13,107 --> 01:00:16,523
My police tore that dam apart.

627
01:00:17,363 --> 01:00:20,811
Your little family
are nowhere to be found.

628
01:00:24,691 --> 01:00:27,474
- Where did they go?
- I don't know!

629
01:00:28,180 --> 01:00:30,700
Then you're of no further use to me.

630
01:00:30,771 --> 01:00:34,961
Wait! The beaver
said something about Aslan!

631
01:00:39,187 --> 01:00:40,616
Aslan?

632
01:00:41,907 --> 01:00:42,889
Where?

633
01:00:45,426 --> 01:00:48,077
- I...
- He's a stranger here, Your Majesty.

634
01:00:48,147 --> 01:00:50,035
He can't be expected
to know anything.

635
01:00:51,890 --> 01:00:55,599
I said... where is Aslan?

636
01:00:59,794 --> 01:01:01,867
I... I don't know.

637
01:01:01,939 --> 01:01:04,240
I left before they said anything.

638
01:01:06,610 --> 01:01:08,879
I wanted to see you!

639
01:01:11,089 --> 01:01:12,813
Guard!

640
01:01:13,394 --> 01:01:15,117
Your Majesty.

641
01:01:17,234 --> 01:01:19,951
Release the faun.

642
01:01:20,690 --> 01:01:23,111
Ah! Ah!

643
01:01:31,986 --> 01:01:33,927
Do you know why you're here, faun?

644
01:01:35,474 --> 01:01:40,231
Because I believe in a free Narnia.

645
01:01:41,201 --> 01:01:43,406
You're here...

646
01:01:43,474 --> 01:01:46,823
...because he turned you in.

647
01:01:48,528 --> 01:01:49,958
For sweeties.

648
01:01:57,489 --> 01:01:59,278
Take him upstairs.

649
01:02:04,752 --> 01:02:07,305
And ready my sleigh.

650
01:02:07,376 --> 01:02:09,929
Edmund misses his family.

651
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:34,789
Now, Aslan's camp
is near the Stone Table

652
01:02:34,863 --> 01:02:38,278
- just across the frozen river.
- River?

653
01:02:38,351 --> 01:02:42,181
The river's been frozen solid
for a hundred years.

654
01:02:45,168 --> 01:02:48,463
- It's so far.
- It's the world, dear.

655
01:02:48,528 --> 01:02:50,316
Did you expect it to be small?

656
01:02:51,216 --> 01:02:53,387
Smaller.

657
01:03:09,487 --> 01:03:12,389
When you're ready, Son of Adam.

658
01:03:19,694 --> 01:03:22,062
Yah! Yah! Yah!

659
01:03:46,222 --> 01:03:49,867
Come on, humans!
While we're still young.

660
01:03:50,542 --> 01:03:53,226
If he tells us to hurry one more time,

661
01:03:53,295 --> 01:03:56,939
I'm gonna turn him
into a big, fluffy hat.

662
01:03:57,007 --> 01:03:59,243
Hurry up! Come on!

663
01:03:59,310 --> 01:04:02,888
- He is getting a little bossy.
- Behind you! It's her!

664
01:04:02,958 --> 01:04:04,781
- Run! Run!
- Run!

665
01:04:28,942 --> 01:04:30,186
Hurry!

666
01:04:32,877 --> 01:04:34,471
Inside!

667
01:04:34,542 --> 01:04:36,330
Dive! Dive!

668
01:04:38,701 --> 01:04:40,773
Quick! Quick, quick, quick!

669
01:05:07,885 --> 01:05:10,251
Maybe she's gone.

670
01:05:11,116 --> 01:05:13,506
- I suppose I'll go look.
- No!

671
01:05:13,580 --> 01:05:16,068
You're worth nothing to Narnia dead.

672
01:05:16,140 --> 01:05:18,049
Well, neither are you, Beaver.

673
01:05:18,124 --> 01:05:20,229
Thanks, sweetheart.

674
01:05:28,268 --> 01:05:31,748
- What's that? What's...
- Shh, shh, shh.

675
01:05:34,604 --> 01:05:36,295
Come out! Come out!

676
01:05:36,364 --> 01:05:39,430
I hope you've all been good
'cause there's someone here to see you!

677
01:06:00,363 --> 01:06:02,186
Merry Christmas, sir.

678
01:06:02,252 --> 01:06:06,114
It certainly is, Lucy,
since you have arrived.

679
01:06:06,188 --> 01:06:10,082
Look, I've put up with a lot
since I got here, but this...

680
01:06:10,155 --> 01:06:13,471
- We thought you were the Witch.
- Yes, yes, I'm sorry about that,

681
01:06:13,547 --> 01:06:18,816
but in my defense, I have been driving
one of these longer than the Witch.

682
01:06:18,890 --> 01:06:21,891
I thought there was
no Christmas in Narnia.

683
01:06:21,964 --> 01:06:24,418
No. For a long time.

684
01:06:24,491 --> 01:06:28,648
But the hope that you have brought,
Your Majesties,

685
01:06:28,715 --> 01:06:32,424
is finally starting
to weaken the Witch's power.

686
01:06:32,490 --> 01:06:36,549
Still, I dare say
you could do with these.

687
01:06:39,147 --> 01:06:41,186
Presents!

688
01:06:47,435 --> 01:06:49,671
The juice of the fire-flower.

689
01:06:49,738 --> 01:06:53,699
One drop will cure any injury.

690
01:06:55,178 --> 01:06:57,665
And though I hope
you never have to use it...

691
01:07:00,618 --> 01:07:02,440
Thank you, sir,

692
01:07:02,506 --> 01:07:05,801
but I think I could be brave enough.

693
01:07:05,866 --> 01:07:08,451
I'm sure you could.

694
01:07:08,521 --> 01:07:11,837
But battles are ugly affairs.

695
01:07:18,186 --> 01:07:19,909
Susan.

696
01:07:22,249 --> 01:07:26,885
Trust in this bow
and it will not easily miss.

697
01:07:27,977 --> 01:07:30,465
What happened
to "battles are ugly affairs"?

698
01:07:32,649 --> 01:07:35,715
Though you don't seem to have
a problem making yourself heard,

699
01:07:35,785 --> 01:07:39,495
blow on this
and wherever you are,

700
01:07:39,561 --> 01:07:41,700
help will come.

701
01:07:42,728 --> 01:07:44,485
Thanks.

702
01:07:45,289 --> 01:07:47,044
Peter.

703
01:07:48,201 --> 01:07:51,910
The time to use these
may be near at hand.

704
01:07:59,273 --> 01:08:00,418
Thank you, sir.

705
01:08:01,160 --> 01:08:04,836
These are tools, not toys.

706
01:08:04,904 --> 01:08:07,043
Bear them well and wisely.

707
01:08:08,679 --> 01:08:11,265
Now, I must be off.

708
01:08:11,336 --> 01:08:13,791
Winter is almost over,

709
01:08:13,864 --> 01:08:18,119
and things do pile up
when you've been gone a hundred years.

710
01:08:21,352 --> 01:08:23,425
Long live Aslan!

711
01:08:25,736 --> 01:08:27,677
And Merry Christmas!

712
01:08:30,024 --> 01:08:32,511
- Merry Christmas!
- Merry Christmas!

713
01:08:32,583 --> 01:08:35,779
- See you next year!
- Goodbye!

714
01:08:35,847 --> 01:08:37,823
Told you he was real.

715
01:08:38,184 --> 01:08:42,788
He said winter was almost over.

716
01:08:42,855 --> 01:08:44,830
You know what that means.

717
01:08:46,375 --> 01:08:48,677
No more ice.

718
01:08:58,343 --> 01:09:01,508
- We need to cross, now!
- Don't beavers make dams?

719
01:09:01,576 --> 01:09:03,714
- I'm not that fast, dear.
- Come on!

720
01:09:03,783 --> 01:09:05,954
Wait! Will you think
about this for a minute?

721
01:09:06,023 --> 01:09:08,707
- We don't have a minute.
- I'm just trying to be realistic.

722
01:09:08,775 --> 01:09:12,157
No, you're trying to be smart.
As usual.

723
01:09:45,222 --> 01:09:47,611
Wait. Maybe I should go first.

724
01:09:48,198 --> 01:09:50,337
Maybe you should.

725
01:09:56,038 --> 01:09:58,885
You've been sneaking
second helpings, haven't you?

726
01:09:58,949 --> 01:10:01,405
Well, you never know
which meal's gonna be your last.

727
01:10:01,478 --> 01:10:04,641
Especially with your cooking.

728
01:10:22,405 --> 01:10:24,293
If Mum knew what we were doing...

729
01:10:24,357 --> 01:10:25,698
Mum's not here.

730
01:10:27,621 --> 01:10:29,693
Oh, no!

731
01:10:29,764 --> 01:10:31,106
Run!

732
01:10:34,373 --> 01:10:35,802
Hurry!

733
01:10:45,572 --> 01:10:47,001
No!

734
01:10:47,076 --> 01:10:48,254
Peter!

735
01:10:48,900 --> 01:10:50,689
Put that down, boy.

736
01:10:51,332 --> 01:10:54,463
- Someone could get hurt.
- Don't worry about me!

737
01:10:54,533 --> 01:10:55,842
Run him through!

738
01:10:55,908 --> 01:10:59,454
Leave now while you can,
and your brother leaves with you.

739
01:10:59,525 --> 01:11:02,372
Stop, Peter!
Maybe we should listen to him!

740
01:11:02,436 --> 01:11:04,028
Smart girl.

741
01:11:04,100 --> 01:11:07,232
Don't listen to him!
Kill him! Kill him now!

742
01:11:07,299 --> 01:11:10,464
Oh, come on. This isn't your war.

743
01:11:10,532 --> 01:11:13,881
All my Queen wants is for you
to take your family and go.

744
01:11:13,956 --> 01:11:16,639
Look, just because some man
in a red coat hands you a sword,

745
01:11:16,708 --> 01:11:20,123
it doesn't make you a hero!
Just drop it!

746
01:11:20,196 --> 01:11:22,683
No, Peter!
Narnia needs you!

747
01:11:22,755 --> 01:11:24,959
Gut him while you still have a chance!

748
01:11:25,027 --> 01:11:28,956
What's it gonna be, Son of Adam?
I won't wait forever.

749
01:11:29,028 --> 01:11:30,685
And neither will the river.

750
01:11:32,515 --> 01:11:33,693
Peter!

751
01:11:41,155 --> 01:11:42,464
Hold onto me!

752
01:12:39,970 --> 01:12:42,337
Lovely.

753
01:12:50,369 --> 01:12:52,344
What have you done?

754
01:12:54,657 --> 01:12:56,632
Lucy!

755
01:12:58,049 --> 01:12:59,773
Lucy!

756
01:13:03,905 --> 01:13:05,977
Has anyone seen my coat?

757
01:13:12,322 --> 01:13:14,176
Don't you worry, dear.

758
01:13:14,241 --> 01:13:17,372
Your brother's got you
well looked after.

759
01:13:17,440 --> 01:13:21,018
And I don't think you'll be
needing those coats anymore.

760
01:13:54,528 --> 01:13:57,943
It's so warm out.

761
01:14:00,896 --> 01:14:03,678
I'll go and check the sleigh.

762
01:14:05,408 --> 01:14:06,968
Your Majesty.

763
01:14:07,040 --> 01:14:08,698
We found the traitor.

764
01:14:08,768 --> 01:14:11,004
He was rallying your enemies
near the Shuddering Woods.

765
01:14:12,128 --> 01:14:14,298
Ah. Nice of you to drop in.

766
01:14:14,367 --> 01:14:16,735
You were so helpful
to my wolves last night.

767
01:14:17,152 --> 01:14:19,573
Perhaps you can help me now.

768
01:14:19,647 --> 01:14:23,357
- Forgive me, Your Majesty.
- Oh, don't waste time with flattery.

769
01:14:23,423 --> 01:14:27,766
Not to seem rude,
but I wasn't actually talking to you.

770
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,388
Where are the humans headed?

771
01:14:42,175 --> 01:14:46,452
Wait! No! Don't. The beaver said
something about the Stone Table,

772
01:14:46,527 --> 01:14:48,282
and that Aslan had an army there.

773
01:14:50,079 --> 01:14:52,183
An army?

774
01:14:57,055 --> 01:14:59,062
Thank you, Edmund.

775
01:14:59,135 --> 01:15:02,484
I'm glad this creature
got to see some honesty...

776
01:15:03,742 --> 01:15:06,644
...before he dies.
- No!

777
01:15:16,670 --> 01:15:19,769
Think about whose side you're on,
Edmund.

778
01:15:19,838 --> 01:15:21,911
Mine...

779
01:15:23,805 --> 01:15:25,595
...or theirs.

780
01:15:30,845 --> 01:15:34,141
Go on ahead.
Gather the faithful.

781
01:15:34,494 --> 01:15:37,363
If it's a war Aslan wants...

782
01:15:39,006 --> 01:15:41,177
...it's a war he shall get.

783
01:16:39,900 --> 01:16:42,452
Why are they all staring at us?

784
01:16:42,523 --> 01:16:44,858
Maybe they think you look funny.

785
01:16:49,277 --> 01:16:53,270
Oi, stop your fussing.
You look lovely.

786
01:17:10,492 --> 01:17:12,979
We have come to see Aslan.

787
01:17:54,842 --> 01:17:58,158
Welcome, Peter, Son of Adam.

788
01:17:58,234 --> 01:18:01,976
Welcome, Susan and Lucy,
Daughters of Eve.

789
01:18:02,042 --> 01:18:05,491
And welcome to you, Beavers.
You have my thanks.

790
01:18:05,563 --> 01:18:08,432
But where is the fourth?

791
01:18:09,051 --> 01:18:11,898
That's why we're here, sir.

792
01:18:11,962 --> 01:18:13,368
We need your help.

793
01:18:13,433 --> 01:18:16,434
We had a little trouble along the way.

794
01:18:16,506 --> 01:18:18,742
Our brother's been captured
by the White Witch.

795
01:18:18,810 --> 01:18:21,559
Captured? How could this happen?

796
01:18:23,034 --> 01:18:27,289
He betrayed them, Your Majesty.

797
01:18:27,354 --> 01:18:30,998
- Then he has betrayed us all!
- Peace, Oreius.

798
01:18:31,066 --> 01:18:32,952
I'm sure there's an explanation.

799
01:18:35,801 --> 01:18:37,972
It's my fault, really.

800
01:18:39,258 --> 01:18:41,810
I was too hard on him.

801
01:18:45,145 --> 01:18:46,487
We all were.

802
01:18:47,385 --> 01:18:49,141
Sir, he's our brother.

803
01:18:49,209 --> 01:18:51,119
I know, dear one.

804
01:18:51,194 --> 01:18:54,805
But that only makes
the betrayal all the worse.

805
01:18:54,873 --> 01:18:57,840
This may be harder than you think.

806
01:19:04,408 --> 01:19:09,165
That is Cair Paravel,
the castle of the four thrones.

807
01:19:10,041 --> 01:19:14,230
In one of which you will sit, Peter,
as High King.

808
01:19:14,808 --> 01:19:17,143
You doubt the prophecy?

809
01:19:17,209 --> 01:19:20,504
No. That's just it.

810
01:19:21,912 --> 01:19:24,760
Aslan, I'm not what you all think I am.

811
01:19:24,824 --> 01:19:27,093
Peter Pevensie, formerly of Finchley.

812
01:19:28,281 --> 01:19:33,103
Beaver also mentioned that you
planned on turning him into a hat.

813
01:19:35,512 --> 01:19:38,895
Peter, there is a Deep Magic,

814
01:19:38,968 --> 01:19:40,561
more powerful than any of us,

815
01:19:40,632 --> 01:19:42,770
that rules over all of Narnia.

816
01:19:42,840 --> 01:19:45,295
It defines right from wrong,

817
01:19:45,368 --> 01:19:47,954
and governs all our destinies.

818
01:19:48,024 --> 01:19:50,958
Yours... and mine.

819
01:19:51,320 --> 01:19:53,392
But I couldn't even
protect my own family.

820
01:19:53,463 --> 01:19:55,885
You've brought them safely this far.

821
01:19:56,183 --> 01:19:57,972
Not all of them.

822
01:19:58,040 --> 01:20:02,196
Peter, I will do what I can
to help your brother,

823
01:20:02,263 --> 01:20:05,230
but I need you to consider
what I ask of you.

824
01:20:07,128 --> 01:20:09,516
I, too, want my family safe.

825
01:20:12,471 --> 01:20:16,365
Is our little prince uncomfortable?

826
01:20:16,439 --> 01:20:19,701
Does he want his pillow fluffed?

827
01:20:21,463 --> 01:20:25,838
Special treatment for the special boy!

828
01:20:26,966 --> 01:20:29,334
Isn't that what you wanted?

829
01:20:32,087 --> 01:20:33,713
You look like Mum.

830
01:20:33,783 --> 01:20:36,597
Mum hasn't had a dress like this
since before the war.

831
01:20:37,942 --> 01:20:41,684
We should bring her one back.
A whole trunk full!

832
01:20:42,870 --> 01:20:44,561
If we ever get back.

833
01:20:48,534 --> 01:20:50,901
I'm sorry I'm like that.

834
01:20:52,086 --> 01:20:55,435
We used to have fun together, didn't we?

835
01:20:55,478 --> 01:20:59,635
Yes. Before you got boring.

836
01:20:59,702 --> 01:21:01,076
Oh, really?

837
01:21:14,101 --> 01:21:15,476
Please don't try to run.

838
01:21:15,542 --> 01:21:19,252
- We're tired.
- And we prefer to kill you quickly.

839
01:21:22,966 --> 01:21:24,624
Susan!

840
01:21:34,453 --> 01:21:35,761
Get back!

841
01:21:36,726 --> 01:21:38,548
Peter! Ah!

842
01:21:40,245 --> 01:21:41,587
Come on.

843
01:21:42,517 --> 01:21:45,365
We've already been through this before.

844
01:21:45,429 --> 01:21:47,884
We both know you haven't got it in you.

845
01:21:47,957 --> 01:21:49,648
Peter! Watch out!

846
01:21:58,324 --> 01:22:02,831
No! Stay your weapons.
This is Peter's battle.

847
01:22:04,276 --> 01:22:06,316
You may think you're a king,

848
01:22:06,388 --> 01:22:08,592
but you're going to die...

849
01:22:08,660 --> 01:22:10,798
...like a dog!
- Look out!

850
01:22:11,508 --> 01:22:13,068
Peter!

851
01:22:28,116 --> 01:22:30,985
After him.

852
01:22:32,244 --> 01:22:34,317
He'll lead you to Edmund.

853
01:22:38,356 --> 01:22:39,817
Peter.

854
01:22:40,532 --> 01:22:42,026
Clean your sword.

855
01:22:46,484 --> 01:22:50,956
Rise, Sir Peter Wolf's-Bane,

856
01:22:51,027 --> 01:22:53,711
Knight of Narnia.

857
01:23:18,706 --> 01:23:20,332
The minotaurs will take the left flanks.

858
01:23:20,403 --> 01:23:23,469
We'll keep the giants in reserve
and send the dwarfs in first.

859
01:23:29,458 --> 01:23:31,051
Ah!

860
01:23:32,147 --> 01:23:33,902
The prisoner!

861
01:24:01,458 --> 01:24:03,497
You're not
going to kill me?

862
01:24:06,482 --> 01:24:08,369
Not yet.

863
01:24:11,634 --> 01:24:13,707
We have work to do.

864
01:24:43,409 --> 01:24:45,263
Edmund!

865
01:25:15,888 --> 01:25:18,059
What's done is done.

866
01:25:18,128 --> 01:25:22,056
There is no need to speak to Edmund
about what is past.

867
01:25:30,544 --> 01:25:32,137
Hello.

868
01:25:45,552 --> 01:25:48,551
- Are you all right?
- I'm a little tired.

869
01:25:48,623 --> 01:25:50,827
Get some sleep.

870
01:25:58,479 --> 01:26:00,487
And Edmund...

871
01:26:02,575 --> 01:26:04,136
...try not to wander off.

872
01:26:16,974 --> 01:26:19,277
Narnia's not going
to run out of toast, Ed.

873
01:26:20,974 --> 01:26:24,203
I'm sure they'll pack something up
for the journey back.

874
01:26:24,270 --> 01:26:25,579
We're going home?

875
01:26:26,479 --> 01:26:28,518
You are.

876
01:26:29,198 --> 01:26:31,587
I promised Mum I'd keep you three safe.

877
01:26:32,430 --> 01:26:34,819
But it doesn't mean
I can't stay behind and help.

878
01:26:34,894 --> 01:26:37,196
But they need us.

879
01:26:38,286 --> 01:26:40,424
All four of us.

880
01:26:40,493 --> 01:26:42,316
Lucy, it's too dangerous.

881
01:26:42,382 --> 01:26:44,837
You almost drowned!
Edmund was almost killed!

882
01:26:45,550 --> 01:26:48,299
Which is why we have to stay.

883
01:26:49,934 --> 01:26:54,504
I've seen what the White Witch can do.
And I've helped her do it.

884
01:26:55,853 --> 01:26:59,497
And we can't leave these
people behind to suffer for it.

885
01:27:06,381 --> 01:27:08,803
I suppose that's it then.

886
01:27:10,092 --> 01:27:11,587
Where are you going?

887
01:27:13,325 --> 01:27:15,659
To get in some practice.

888
01:27:37,740 --> 01:27:40,675
Come on, Ed! Sword point up,
like Oreius showed us.

889
01:27:40,748 --> 01:27:43,018
- En garde!
- Now block.

890
01:27:44,172 --> 01:27:47,588
- Hey!
- Peter! Edmund!

891
01:27:47,660 --> 01:27:50,344
Whoa, horsie!

892
01:27:50,412 --> 01:27:52,833
- My name is Philip.
- Oh.

893
01:27:52,908 --> 01:27:54,632
Sorry.

894
01:27:54,701 --> 01:27:57,188
The Witch has demanded
a meeting with Aslan.

895
01:27:58,477 --> 01:28:00,713
She's on her way here.

896
01:28:00,780 --> 01:28:02,568
Jadis, the Queen of Narnia!

897
01:28:02,601 --> 01:28:04,355
Jadis, the Queen of Narnia!

898
01:28:04,428 --> 01:28:08,519
- Go away, Witch!
- Empress of the Lone Islands!

899
01:28:09,196 --> 01:28:12,065
You don't belong here!
Go away!

900
01:28:34,891 --> 01:28:37,378
You have a traitor in your midst, Aslan.

901
01:28:40,620 --> 01:28:43,402
His offense was not against you.

902
01:28:43,916 --> 01:28:47,047
Have you forgotten the laws
upon which Narnia was built?

903
01:28:47,115 --> 01:28:50,464
Do not cite the Deep Magic to me, Witch.

904
01:28:50,538 --> 01:28:53,505
I was there when it was written.

905
01:28:54,282 --> 01:28:59,236
Then you'll remember well
that every traitor belongs to me.

906
01:28:59,691 --> 01:29:02,473
His blood is my property.

907
01:29:02,539 --> 01:29:04,742
Try and take him then.

908
01:29:07,371 --> 01:29:11,876
Do you really think that mere force
will deny me my right...

909
01:29:12,490 --> 01:29:14,181
...little King?

910
01:29:16,618 --> 01:29:20,230
Aslan knows that unless I have blood,
as the law demands,

911
01:29:20,298 --> 01:29:23,593
all of Narnia will be overturned

912
01:29:23,658 --> 01:29:26,527
and perish in fire and water.

913
01:29:26,602 --> 01:29:29,701
That boy will die

914
01:29:29,770 --> 01:29:33,218
on the Stone Table...

915
01:29:35,049 --> 01:29:37,122
...as is tradition.

916
01:29:39,401 --> 01:29:41,790
You dare not refuse me.

917
01:29:42,249 --> 01:29:43,591
Enough.

918
01:29:46,537 --> 01:29:48,676
I shall talk with you alone.

919
01:30:39,848 --> 01:30:42,566
She has renounced her claim
on the Son of Adam's blood.

920
01:30:44,552 --> 01:30:47,269
How do I know your promise will be kept?

921
01:31:38,087 --> 01:31:41,120
- Susan!
- Mm?

922
01:32:28,518 --> 01:32:31,235
Shouldn't you both be in bed?

923
01:32:33,637 --> 01:32:35,874
We couldn't sleep.

924
01:32:36,901 --> 01:32:39,105
Please, Aslan.

925
01:32:39,621 --> 01:32:41,246
Couldn't we come with you?

926
01:32:41,317 --> 01:32:44,317
I would be glad of the company
for a while.

927
01:32:45,926 --> 01:32:47,682
Thank you.

928
01:33:10,661 --> 01:33:12,319
It is time.

929
01:33:12,389 --> 01:33:15,684
From here, I must go on alone.

930
01:33:15,748 --> 01:33:17,123
But Aslan...

931
01:33:17,189 --> 01:33:20,571
You have to trust me.
For this must be done.

932
01:33:21,125 --> 01:33:22,815
Thank you, Susan.

933
01:33:22,884 --> 01:33:25,219
Thank you, Lucy.

934
01:33:25,285 --> 01:33:27,259
And farewell.

935
01:34:30,147 --> 01:34:33,693
Behold. The great lion.

936
01:34:58,626 --> 01:35:00,219
Do you want some milk?

937
01:35:01,762 --> 01:35:03,289
Why doesn't he fight back?

938
01:35:04,930 --> 01:35:07,035
Bind him!

939
01:35:07,554 --> 01:35:10,423
Tie him up! Get him!

940
01:35:14,498 --> 01:35:16,504
Wait!

941
01:35:17,538 --> 01:35:20,439
Let him first be shaved.

942
01:35:41,506 --> 01:35:43,000
Bring him to me.

943
01:36:41,600 --> 01:36:44,217
You know, Aslan,

944
01:36:44,287 --> 01:36:46,459
I'm a little disappointed in you.

945
01:36:48,255 --> 01:36:52,216
Did you honestly think by all this
that you could save the human traitor?

946
01:36:55,200 --> 01:36:57,949
You are giving me your life

947
01:36:58,015 --> 01:36:59,902
and saving no one.

948
01:37:02,688 --> 01:37:04,542
So much for love.

949
01:37:13,056 --> 01:37:15,160
Tonight...

950
01:37:15,807 --> 01:37:20,215
...the Deep Magic will be appeased!

951
01:37:23,615 --> 01:37:26,200
But tomorrow,

952
01:37:27,551 --> 01:37:31,413
we will take Narnia

953
01:37:31,487 --> 01:37:35,643
forever!

954
01:37:40,319 --> 01:37:42,391
In that knowledge,

955
01:37:42,463 --> 01:37:45,244
despair...

956
01:37:53,726 --> 01:37:56,377
...and die!

957
01:38:14,174 --> 01:38:16,028
The Great Cat...

958
01:38:16,093 --> 01:38:18,680
...is dead!

959
01:38:22,206 --> 01:38:24,180
General.

960
01:38:24,253 --> 01:38:27,100
Prepare your troops for battle.

961
01:38:30,046 --> 01:38:32,380
However short it may be.

962
01:39:18,076 --> 01:39:20,629
It's too late.

963
01:39:20,700 --> 01:39:22,937
He's gone.

964
01:39:41,980 --> 01:39:44,598
He must have known what he was doing.

965
01:40:16,379 --> 01:40:19,826
Get away! Get away, all of you!

966
01:40:19,899 --> 01:40:22,834
No. Look.

967
01:40:42,810 --> 01:40:45,363
We have to tell the others.

968
01:40:45,850 --> 01:40:49,363
- We can't just leave him!
- Lucy, there's no time.

969
01:40:49,434 --> 01:40:51,605
They need to know.

970
01:40:57,593 --> 01:40:59,568
The trees.

971
01:41:41,945 --> 01:41:43,855
Be still, my Princes.

972
01:41:45,560 --> 01:41:48,724
I bring grave news from your sisters.

973
01:42:03,128 --> 01:42:04,884
She's right.

974
01:42:07,927 --> 01:42:09,716
He's gone.

975
01:42:14,936 --> 01:42:17,009
Then you'll have to lead us.

976
01:42:19,032 --> 01:42:24,117
Peter, there's an army out there
and it's ready to follow you.

977
01:42:24,184 --> 01:42:27,566
- I can't.
- Aslan believed you could.

978
01:42:30,423 --> 01:42:32,311
And so do I.

979
01:42:39,671 --> 01:42:43,468
The Witch's army is nearing, sire.
What are your orders?

980
01:43:27,190 --> 01:43:30,671
They come, Your Highness, in numbers
and weapons far greater than our own.

981
01:43:30,742 --> 01:43:32,814
Numbers do not win a battle.

982
01:43:32,886 --> 01:43:36,563
No. But I bet they help.

983
01:45:02,899 --> 01:45:05,321
I have no interest in prisoners.

984
01:45:05,396 --> 01:45:07,152
Kill them all.

985
01:45:07,220 --> 01:45:11,148
Ahh!

986
01:45:53,522 --> 01:45:56,075
Go on!

987
01:46:02,035 --> 01:46:04,653
Look to the sky!

988
01:46:30,449 --> 01:46:32,304
Are you with me?

989
01:46:33,457 --> 01:46:34,767
To the death.

990
01:46:37,777 --> 01:46:42,217
For Narnia and for Aslan!

991
01:46:46,129 --> 01:46:48,301
Go!

992
01:46:48,370 --> 01:46:50,988
Go! For Aslan!

993
01:48:19,376 --> 01:48:21,481
We should go.

994
01:48:26,575 --> 01:48:28,615
I'm so cold.

995
01:48:48,238 --> 01:48:50,181
Ah!

996
01:48:53,486 --> 01:48:55,242
Susan!

997
01:49:10,734 --> 01:49:12,709
Where's Aslan?

998
01:49:14,094 --> 01:49:15,917
What have they done?

999
01:49:25,614 --> 01:49:27,108
Aslan!

1000
01:49:34,990 --> 01:49:37,291
But we saw the knife. The Witch.

1001
01:49:37,357 --> 01:49:40,739
If the Witch knew
the true meaning of sacrifice,

1002
01:49:40,813 --> 01:49:44,010
she might have interpreted
the Deep Magic differently.

1003
01:49:44,077 --> 01:49:46,598
That when a willing victim
who has committed no treachery

1004
01:49:46,670 --> 01:49:48,808
is killed in a traitor's stead,

1005
01:49:48,877 --> 01:49:52,008
the Stone Table will crack

1006
01:49:52,077 --> 01:49:55,590
and even death itself
will turn backwards.

1007
01:49:55,661 --> 01:49:58,083
We sent the news that you were dead.

1008
01:49:58,157 --> 01:50:00,261
Peter and Edmund will have gone to war.

1009
01:50:00,332 --> 01:50:01,674
We have to help them.

1010
01:50:01,741 --> 01:50:05,386
We will, dear one, but not alone.

1011
01:50:05,773 --> 01:50:07,398
Climb on my back.

1012
01:50:07,468 --> 01:50:10,087
We have far to go
and little time to get there.

1013
01:50:10,157 --> 01:50:12,775
And you may want to cover your ears.

1014
01:50:32,813 --> 01:50:34,722
Fire!

1015
01:50:53,580 --> 01:50:55,336
Yes!

1016
01:51:07,083 --> 01:51:09,898
Fall back! Draw them to the rocks!

1017
01:51:09,963 --> 01:51:13,640
That's the signal. Come on!

1018
01:51:21,131 --> 01:51:22,504
Where are we going?

1019
01:51:32,331 --> 01:51:33,858
Hang on!

1020
01:51:35,051 --> 01:51:36,545
Fall back!

1021
01:51:38,314 --> 01:51:39,721
Go on, fall back!

1022
01:52:14,890 --> 01:52:16,165
Stop!

1023
01:54:23,239 --> 01:54:25,028
Susan, this is...

1024
01:54:25,094 --> 01:54:27,331
Mr. Tumnus!

1025
01:54:28,070 --> 01:54:31,201
Come, we must hurry
and search the castle.

1026
01:54:31,271 --> 01:54:33,921
Peter will need everyone we can find.

1027
01:54:39,430 --> 01:54:40,771
Ah!

1028
01:54:59,461 --> 01:55:01,950
Edmund! There's too many!

1029
01:55:02,022 --> 01:55:03,515
Get out of here!

1030
01:55:03,589 --> 01:55:06,404
Get the girls and get them home!

1031
01:55:08,774 --> 01:55:11,195
You heard him! Let's go!

1032
01:55:29,956 --> 01:55:31,517
Peter said get out of here!

1033
01:55:31,589 --> 01:55:33,345
Peter's not king yet.

1034
01:56:41,636 --> 01:56:43,196
Ah!

1035
01:57:06,627 --> 01:57:07,903
Impossible!

1036
01:57:42,723 --> 01:57:44,315
Ah!

1037
01:58:19,362 --> 01:58:20,638
It is finished.

1038
01:58:22,081 --> 01:58:24,351
- Peter!
- Peter!

1039
01:58:29,728 --> 01:58:31,769
Where's Edmund?

1040
01:58:42,849 --> 01:58:44,604
Edmund!

1041
01:58:44,640 --> 01:58:45,720
Ah!

1042
01:59:35,071 --> 01:59:37,438
When are you gonna learn
to do as you're told?

1043
02:01:08,925 --> 02:01:11,773
To the glistening Eastern Sea,

1044
02:01:11,837 --> 02:01:16,146
I give you Queen Lucy the Valiant.

1045
02:01:39,900 --> 02:01:42,234
To the great Western Wood,

1046
02:01:42,301 --> 02:01:46,456
King Edmund the Just.

1047
02:01:47,516 --> 02:01:50,615
To the radiant Southern Sun,

1048
02:01:51,644 --> 02:01:55,222
Queen Susan, the Gentle.

1049
02:01:55,996 --> 02:01:59,062
And to the clear Northern Sky,

1050
02:01:59,132 --> 02:02:02,677
I give you King Peter,

1051
02:02:02,747 --> 02:02:04,984
the Magnificent.

1052
02:02:08,284 --> 02:02:11,131
Once a King or Queen of Narnia,

1053
02:02:11,196 --> 02:02:14,294
always a King or Queen.

1054
02:02:14,363 --> 02:02:16,054
May your wisdom grace us

1055
02:02:16,124 --> 02:02:19,124
until the stars rain down
from the heavens.

1056
02:02:19,196 --> 02:02:21,464
Long live King Peter!

1057
02:02:21,532 --> 02:02:24,085
Long live King Edmund!

1058
02:02:24,156 --> 02:02:26,611
Long live Queen Susan!

1059
02:02:26,684 --> 02:02:29,913
Long live Queen Lucy!

1060
02:02:53,147 --> 02:02:54,739
Don't worry.

1061
02:02:56,635 --> 02:02:58,523
We'll see him again.

1062
02:02:58,586 --> 02:03:02,034
- When?
- In time.

1063
02:03:02,106 --> 02:03:06,710
One day he'll be here
and the next he won't.

1064
02:03:08,442 --> 02:03:10,296
But you mustn't press him.

1065
02:03:11,097 --> 02:03:13,999
After all, he's not a tame lion.

1066
02:03:14,618 --> 02:03:16,790
No.

1067
02:03:16,858 --> 02:03:18,712
But he is good.

1068
02:03:19,418 --> 02:03:20,979
Here.

1069
02:03:22,521 --> 02:03:24,693
You need it more than I do.

1070
02:04:18,137 --> 02:04:20,209
Are you all right, Philip?

1071
02:04:20,280 --> 02:04:22,484
I'm not as young as I once was.

1072
02:04:24,889 --> 02:04:26,644
Come on, Ed.

1073
02:04:27,064 --> 02:04:29,933
- Just catching my breath.
- That's all we'll catch at this rate.

1074
02:04:30,008 --> 02:04:32,278
- What did he say, Susan?
- "Wait in the castle.

1075
02:04:32,344 --> 02:04:35,442
I'll get the stag myself."

1076
02:04:39,576 --> 02:04:41,331
What's this?

1077
02:04:46,616 --> 02:04:48,917
It seems familiar.

1078
02:04:51,256 --> 02:04:53,110
As if from a dream.

1079
02:04:53,175 --> 02:04:55,150
Or a dream of a dream.

1080
02:04:58,296 --> 02:05:00,499
Spare Oom.

1081
02:05:03,223 --> 02:05:05,678
- Lucy!
- Not again.

1082
02:05:07,320 --> 02:05:09,708
- Lu?
- Come on!

1083
02:05:20,246 --> 02:05:21,741
These aren't branches.

1084
02:05:23,190 --> 02:05:24,139
Ow! Ooh!

1085
02:05:24,215 --> 02:05:27,149
- They're coats.
- Susan, you're on my foot!

1086
02:05:27,222 --> 02:05:29,328
Peter, move off!

1087
02:05:29,399 --> 02:05:31,471
- Stop shoving.
- Stop it!

1088
02:05:31,543 --> 02:05:33,299
I'm not on your toe!

1089
02:05:47,767 --> 02:05:49,360
Oh!

1090
02:05:50,390 --> 02:05:51,917
There you are.

1091
02:05:54,390 --> 02:05:57,042
What were you all
doing in the wardrobe?

1092
02:05:58,870 --> 02:06:01,553
You wouldn't believe us
if we told you, sir.

1093
02:06:07,094 --> 02:06:08,687
Try me.

1094
02:07:08,821 --> 02:07:11,472
I don't think
you'll get back in that way.

1095
02:07:14,453 --> 02:07:18,926
You see... I've already tried.

1096
02:07:20,885 --> 02:07:22,794
Will we ever go back?

1097
02:07:22,869 --> 02:07:24,495
Oh, I expect so.

1098
02:07:25,588 --> 02:07:28,436
But it'll probably happen
when you're not looking for it.

1099
02:07:30,869 --> 02:07:32,429
All the same...

1100
02:07:32,500 --> 02:07:34,922
best to keep your eyes open.

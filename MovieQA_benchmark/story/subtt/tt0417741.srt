- Yes, Miss...?
- Granger, sir.

382
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:31,630
That one there is Veritaserum.
It's a truth-telling serum.

383
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:34,390
And that would be Polyjuice Potion.

384
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,470
It's terribly tricky to make.

385
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:41,590
And this is Amortentia...

386
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:44,060
...the most powerful
love potion in the world.

387
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:48,630
It's rumored to smell differently to each
person according to what attracts them.

388
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:51,790
For example, I smell...

389
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:56,390
...freshly mown grass,
and new parchment, and...

390
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:59,750
...spearmint toothpaste.

391
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:04,430
SLUGHORN: Amortentia doesn't create
actual love. That would be impossible.

392
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:09,390
But it does cause
a powerful infatuation or obsession.

393
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:15,950
And for that reason, it is probably
the most dangerous potion in this room.

what's in that one.

I had him from an egg, you know.
Tiny little thing he was when he hatched.

1208
01:44:15,680 --> 01:44:19,220
No bigger than a Pekinese.
A Pekinese, mind you.

How sweet. I once had a fish. Francis.
He was very dear to me.

1210

One afternoon I came downstairs,

Poof.

01:45:01,040 --> 01:45:04,030
It was a student who gave me Francis.

1218
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:09,110
One spring afternoon
I discovered a bowl on my desk...

1219
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:12,830
...with just a few inches
of clear water in it.

1220
01:45:13,600 --> 01:45:16,990
And floating on the surface
was a flower petal.

1221
01:45:18,480 --> 01:45:20,830
As I watched, it sank.

1222

Because she sacrificed herself.

01:46:24,240 --> 01:46:26,510
Because she refused to step aside.

I was in the library the other night...

1257
01:48:09,800 --> 01:48:11,870
...in the Restricted Section...

1258
01:48:12,720 --> 01:48:16,190
...and I read something rather odd
about a bit of rare magic.

1259
01:48:17,440 --> 01:48:20,070
It's called, as I understand it...

1260
01:48:21,320 --> 01:48:22,590
...a Horcrux.

1261
01:48:24,360 --> 01:48:26,990
- I beg your pardon?
- Horcrux.

1262
01:48:27,400 --> 01:48:29,960
I came across the term while reading...

1263
01:48:30,120 --> 01:48:32,990
...and I didn't fully understand it.

1264
01:48:33,160 --> 01:48:34,830
I'm not sure what you
were reading, Tom...

1265
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:37,460
...but this is very dark stuff,
very dark indeed.

1266
01:48:37,640 --> 01:48:39,110
Which is...

1267
01:48:40,200 --> 01:48:41,950
...why I came to you.

1268
01:48:44,680 --> 01:48:50,070
A Horcrux is an object in which a person
has concealed part of their soul.

1269
01:48:50,240 --> 01:48:52,750
But I don't understand
how that works, sir.

1270
01:48:55,240 --> 01:48:59,070
One splits one's soul and hides
part of it in an object.

1271
01:48:59,240 --> 01:49:02,710
By doing so, you're protected, should
you be attacked and your body destroyed.

1272
01:49:02,880 --> 01:49:03,940
Protected?

1273
01:49:04,120 --> 01:49:07,190
That part of your soul
that is hidden lives on.

1274
01:49:08,600 --> 01:49:10,900
In other words, you cannot die.

1275
01:49:17,800 --> 01:49:20,830

01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:46,070
Merlin's beard, Tom. Isn't it bad enough
to consider killing one person?

01:49:46,240 --> 01:49:49,830
To rip the soul into seven pieces...

1284
01:49:50,960 --> 01:49:53,870
This is all hypothetical, isn't it, Tom?
All academic?

1285
01:49:58,440 --> 01:49:59,710
Of course, sir.

1286
01:50:02,560 --> 01:50:04,470

1288
01:50:28,880 --> 01:50:30,910
This is beyond anything I imagined.

01:50:31,080 --> 01:50:33,640
You mean to say he succeeded, sir,
in making a Horcrux?

1290
01:50:33,800 --> 01:50:36,790
Oh, yes, he succeeded, all right.
And not just once.

01:50:38,120 --> 01:50:41,310
Could be anything.
Most commonplace of objects.

01:50:44,360 --> 01:50:45,990
A ring, for example.

1294
01:50:46,600 --> 01:50:48,030
Or a book.

1295
01:50:49,280 --> 01:50:51,550
- Tom Riddle's diary.
- It's a Horcrux, yes.

1296
01:50:52,040 --> 01:50:54,070
Four years ago, when you saved
Ginny's life...

1297
01:50:54,240 --> 01:50:56,430
...in the Chamber of Secrets,
you brought me this.

1298
01:50:56,600 --> 01:50:58,430
I knew this was
a different kind of magic.

1299
01:50:58,600 --> 01:51:03,390
Very dark, very powerful. But until tonight
I had no idea just how powerful.

1300
01:51:03,560 --> 01:51:05,470
- The ring?
- Belonged to Voldemort's mother.

1301
01:51:05,840 --> 01:51:10,390
Difficult to find.
Even more difficult to destroy.

1302
01:51:10,560 --> 01:51:14,260
But if you could find them all,
if you did destroy each Horcrux...

1303
01:51:14,440 --> 01:51:15,550
One destroys Voldemort.

1304
01:51:15,720 --> 01:51:18,510
But how would you find them?
They could be hidden anywhere.

1305
01:51:18,680 --> 01:51:21,790
True. But magic, especially dark magic...

1306
01:51:35,200 --> 01:51:36,990
...leaves traces.

1307
01:51:44,480 --> 01:51:46,470
It's where you've been going,
isn't it, sir?

1308
01:51:46,640 --> 01:51:48,830
- When you leave the school?
- Yes.

1309
01:51:49,640 --> 01:51:52,590
And I think perhaps
I may have found another.

1310
01:51:52,760 --> 01:51:56,670
But this time,
I cannot hope to destroy it alone.

1311
01:51:58,160 --> 01:52:02,630
Once again,
I must ask too much of you, Harry.

1312
01:52:06,440 --> 01:52:08,630
SNAPE: Have you ever considered
that you ask too much...

1313
01:52:08,800 --> 01:52:11,310
...that you take too much for granted?

1314
01:52:11,480 --> 01:52:16,310
Has it ever crossed your brilliant mind
that I don't want to do this anymore?

1315
01:52:16,480 --> 01:52:18,510
Whether it has or hasn't is irrelevant.

1316
01:52:19,360 --> 01:52:24,910
I will not negotiate with you, Severus.
You agreed. Nothing more to discuss.

1317
01:52:42,560 --> 01:52:44,110
Oh, Harry.

1318
01:52:46,600 --> 01:52:48,830
You need a shave, my friend.

1319
01:52:51,520 --> 01:52:55,550
You know, at times,
I forget how much you've grown.

1320
01:52:55,720 --> 01:52:59,500
At times, I still see the small boy
from the cupboard.

1321
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:03,270
Forgive my mawkishness, Harry.

1322
01:53:03,720 --> 01:53:05,150
I'm an old man.

1323
01:53:05,320 --> 01:53:06,910
You still look the same to me, sir.

1324
01:53:08,320 --> 01:53:11,190
Just like your mother,
you're unfailingly kind.

1325
01:53:11,360 --> 01:53:14,430
A trait people never fail to undervalue,
I'm afraid.

1326
01:53:17,080 --> 01:53:21,390
The place to which we journey tonight
is extremely dangerous.

1327
01:53:21,560 --> 01:53:24,910
I promised you could accompany me,
and I stand by that promise.

1328
01:53:25,080 --> 01:53:26,830
But there is one condition:

1329
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:30,070
You must obey every command
I give you, without question.

1330
01:53:30,920 --> 01:53:32,470
Yes, sir.

1331
01:53:32,640 --> 01:53:34,670
You do understand what I'm saying?

1332
01:53:35,240 --> 01:53:37,620
Should I tell you to hide, you hide.

1333
01:53:37,800 --> 01:53:40,030
Should I tell you to run, you run.

1334
01:53:40,200 --> 01:53:44,030
Should I tell you to abandon me
and save yourself, you must do so.

My word.

Apparate within Hogwarts.

Oh, yes.

01:55:03,720 --> 01:55:05,190
- Sir!
- In order to gain passage...

1344
01:55:05,360 --> 01:55:06,710
...payment must be made.

1345
01:55:06,880 --> 01:55:10,350
Payment intended
to weaken any intruder.

1346
01:55:11,880 --> 01:55:13,630
- You should've let me, sir.
- No, Harry.

1347
01:55:14,080 --> 01:55:16,670
Your blood's much more precious
than mine.

01:55:37,680 --> 01:55:42,110
Voldemort will not have made it easy
to discover his hiding place.

1349
01:55:42,280 --> 01:55:45,470
He will have put certain defenses
in position.

1350
01:55:47,960 --> 01:55:49,310
Careful.

1351
01:56:11,880 --> 01:56:12,940
There it is.

1352
01:56:14,400 --> 01:56:16,990
The only question is,
how do we get there?

1353
01:56:38,280 --> 01:56:40,030

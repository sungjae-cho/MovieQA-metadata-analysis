00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,073


2
00:00:49,909 --> 00:00:53,469
<i>...what has turned into a
classic Formula 1 season.</i>

3
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:58,448
<i>...with the weather
conditions so uncertain,</i>

4
00:00:58,450 --> 00:01:00,850
<i>the drivers prepare for...</i>

5
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,129
<i>...the track is still
dangerously wet,</i>

6
00:01:04,129 --> 00:01:07,448
<i>but following a drivers meeting,
a decision has been taken.</i>

7
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:11,120
<i>Three minutes to go.
Everybody off the grid now.</i>

8
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:29,368
<i>25 drivers start every
season in Formula 1,</i>

9
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:32,460
<i>and each year, two of us die.</i>

10
00:01:33,219 --> 00:01:36,618
<i>What kind of person
does a job like this?</i>

11
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:39,158
<i>Not normal men, for sure.</i>

12
00:01:39,159 --> 00:01:40,299
<i>Rebels,</i>

13
00:01:40,299 --> 00:01:41,658
<i>lunatics,</i>

14
00:01:41,659 --> 00:01:43,329
<i>dreamers.</i>

15
00:01:43,629 --> 00:01:46,198
<i>People who are desperate
to make a Mark</i>

16
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,500
<i>and are prepared to die trying.</i>

17
00:01:50,509 --> 00:01:52,239
<i>My name is Niki Lauda,</i>

18
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,438
<i>and racing people know
me for two things.</i>

19
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:58,609
<i>The first is my
rivalry with him.</i>

20
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:09,218
What about Hunt? Has he changed?

21
00:02:09,219 --> 00:02:10,759
No, he's going on wets.

22
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:13,728
<i>I don't know why it
became such a big thing.</i>

23
00:02:13,729 --> 00:02:18,269
<i>We were just drivers busting
each other's balls.</i>

24
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:20,468
<i>To me this is perfectly normal,</i>

25
00:02:20,469 --> 00:02:22,699
<i>but other people saw
it differently,</i>

26
00:02:22,699 --> 00:02:26,199
<i>that whatever it was
between us went deeper.</i>

27
00:02:42,189 --> 00:02:44,288
<i>The other thing I'm
remembered for</i>

28
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:47,959
<i>is what happened on
1st August 1976,</i>

29
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:51,020
<i>when I was chasing
him like an asshole.</i>

30
00:03:19,329 --> 00:03:22,399
Yeah, that's the one. On the
second shelf. Thank you.

31
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,628
Trauma trolley, please.

32
00:03:23,629 --> 00:03:26,329
I think the racetrack telephoned
ahead that I was coming.

33
00:03:26,329 --> 00:03:28,170
Hunt. James Hunt.

34
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:36,209
What's the matter? No one ever
seen a spot of blood before?

35
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:38,969
- Are you all right?
- Absolutely fine.

36
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:43,968
We all thought you'd
been in an accident.

37
00:03:43,969 --> 00:03:45,049
I have.

38
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:46,728
If you call a
friendly disagreement

39
00:03:46,729 --> 00:03:49,250
with another driver an accident.

40
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,498
What did you disagree about?

41
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,360
It's none of your business.

42
00:03:59,329 --> 00:04:00,360
Sorry.

43
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,229
His wife.

44
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:06,239
That's going to need a
couple of stitches.

45
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,538
- It's a nasty cut.
- It was a nasty blow.

46
00:04:08,539 --> 00:04:10,639
Done with a bloody crowbar.

47
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:14,278
- Why? What did you do?
- Nothing.

48
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,939
Only what she asked me to do.

49
00:04:18,649 --> 00:04:20,350
Which was...?

50
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:23,949
I'd be happy to show
you if you like.

51
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,358
Sorry.

52
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:33,168
<i>I have a theory why women
like racing drivers.</i>

53
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:35,939
<i>It's not because they
respect what we do,</i>

54
00:04:35,939 --> 00:04:38,439
<i>driving round and
round in circles.</i>

55
00:04:38,439 --> 00:04:40,408
<i>Mostly they think
that's pathetic</i>

56
00:04:40,409 --> 00:04:42,439
<i>and they're probably right.</i>

57
00:04:42,439 --> 00:04:44,930
<i>It's our closeness to death.</i>

58
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:48,978
<i>The closer you are to death,
the more alive you feel.</i>

59
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:52,588
<i>The more alive you are. And
they can see that in you.</i>

60
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:54,579
<i>They feel that in you.</i>

61
00:04:55,189 --> 00:04:57,528
<i>My name is James Hunt.</i>

62
00:04:57,529 --> 00:04:59,658
<i>My father is a stockbroker,</i>

63
00:04:59,659 --> 00:05:01,759
<i>my sister is a barrister</i>

64
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:04,369
<i>and my brother is an accountant.</i>

65
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:05,918
<i>And I,</i>

66
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:08,449
<i>well, I do this.</i>

67
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:14,209
<i>It's a wonderful way to live.
It's the only way to drive.</i>

68
00:05:14,209 --> 00:05:17,009
<i>As if each day is your last.</i>

69
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:28,559
I've never been to a
Grand Prix before.

70
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,218
You still haven't.

71
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:33,129
- This is Formula 3.
- What's that?

72
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:35,959
That's a lower division,

73
00:05:35,959 --> 00:05:38,728
where idiots like me mess about

74
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:42,098
in the hop of being
talent-spotted to race in F1.

75
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:44,269
- You look disappointed.
- No.

76
00:05:44,269 --> 00:05:47,439
You only slept with me because
you thought I was famous.

77
00:05:47,439 --> 00:05:49,139
That's not true!

78
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,949
Don't worry. I will be one day.

79
00:05:51,949 --> 00:05:53,348
Morning, everyone.

80
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:55,319
- This is Nursie.
- Gemma.

81
00:05:55,579 --> 00:05:58,619
Nursie, this is Bubbles
Horsely, team manager.

82
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:00,149
How do you do?

83
00:06:00,149 --> 00:06:01,689
- Bubbles?
- Yeah.

84
00:06:01,689 --> 00:06:03,988
Doc Postlethwaite, our designer.

85
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:05,358
How do you do?

86
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,990
And Alexander, Lord
Hesketh, the team's owner.

87
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,930
How do you do?

88
00:06:12,269 --> 00:06:13,728
Fine, thanks.

89
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:16,038
Well done, Superstar!

90
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:18,338
- That's the car?
- Yep, that's her.

91
00:06:18,339 --> 00:06:19,740
Lotus 59.

92
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:22,939
1000cc. Cosworth Mae engine.

93
00:06:22,939 --> 00:06:26,139
She's no beauty, but
goes like the slappers.

94
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:34,588
Nothing to be worried about.
Does it before every race.

95
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:37,228
Good sign, actually.
Means he's stoked.

96
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,928
All Formula 3 cars to
the assembly area.

97
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:41,329
Now, please.

98
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,470
...drivers please bring them
to the scrutineering bay now.

99
00:06:56,110 --> 00:06:58,009
All right, Superstar?

100
00:06:58,009 --> 00:06:59,579
Never better, patron.

101
00:06:59,579 --> 00:07:02,050
- Have a gargle with this.
- Thank you.

102
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:06,088
Quick toke of this.

103
00:07:06,089 --> 00:07:09,389
At Crystal Palace today,
James Hunt's on pole,

104
00:07:09,389 --> 00:07:12,959
with Austrian newcomer
Niki Lauda alongside him

105
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:15,699
and Dave Walker
completing Row 1.

106
00:07:15,699 --> 00:07:18,629
Row 2 is Mike Beuttler
and Dave Morgan,

107
00:07:18,629 --> 00:07:20,399
with Tony Trimmer
and Gerry Birrell.

108
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:21,538
Who's that?

109
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:22,589
He's new.

110
00:07:23,399 --> 00:07:26,129
- Some German.
- Austrian.

111
00:07:26,439 --> 00:07:29,408
He's been here since 5 a.m.
walking the track.

112
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:32,149
You might actually have to
concentrate today, James.

113
00:07:32,149 --> 00:07:33,879
You'll need these.

114
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:36,220
Okay, start her up.

115
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:39,230
Ah! What music!

116
00:07:39,319 --> 00:07:41,259
They could never
have imagined it,

117
00:07:41,259 --> 00:07:43,689
those pioneers who
invented the automobile,

118
00:07:43,689 --> 00:07:45,658
that it would possess
us like this,

119
00:07:45,659 --> 00:07:48,228
in our imaginations, our dreams.

120
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:50,728
Nursie, men love women,

121
00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:52,699
but even more than that,

122
00:07:52,699 --> 00:07:55,290
men love cars!

123
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:06,410
- Come on, James!
- It's James! Go on, James!

124
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:08,649
Go, James!

125
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:17,528
<i>Hunt's still in the lead,</i>

126
00:08:17,529 --> 00:08:20,220
<i>but Niki Lauda is
right on his tail!</i>

127
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:31,538
<i>Hunt and Lauda are proving to
be in a class of their own.</i>

128
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:33,668
<i>They're leaving the
pack far behind.</i>

129
00:08:33,669 --> 00:08:36,230
Herr Red Devil's on his tail.

130
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,450
<i>Lauda takes a look
down the inside...</i>

131
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:47,210
<i>...and he's sold him a dummy!</i>

132
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:52,629
<i>Lauda is through!
He's in the lead!</i>

133
00:08:52,629 --> 00:08:56,080
<i>Hunt will be determined to
make up for that mistake.</i>

134
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:03,668
<i>Hunt's in Lauda's slipstream.</i>

135
00:09:03,669 --> 00:09:06,269
<i>Lauda's not leaving any gap.</i>

136
00:09:11,009 --> 00:09:12,609
<i>The Lotus goes for the inside.</i>

137
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:14,909
<i>It's an aggressive
move from Hunt.</i>

138
00:09:19,289 --> 00:09:20,879
<i>There's contact!</i>

139
00:09:27,429 --> 00:09:31,269
<i>The leaders have spun out!
Lauda's facing the wrong way!</i>

140
00:09:31,269 --> 00:09:33,529
<i>The back marker's gone through!</i>

141
00:09:34,139 --> 00:09:36,239
<i>You can see why Hunter's
fellow drivers call him.</i>

142
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,970
<i>"Hunt the Shunt."</i>

143
00:09:41,409 --> 00:09:42,408
Asshole!

144
00:09:42,409 --> 00:09:44,349
- Go on, James!
- The Kraut's out of it!

145
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:46,278
<i>Lauda is clearly furious.</i>

146
00:09:46,279 --> 00:09:49,479
<i>There's every reason to expect
sharp words in the pit.</i>

147
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,719
<i>It's going to be
victory for Hunt.</i>

148
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:55,210
<i>It's going to be an ignominious
defeat for Niki Lauda.</i>

149
00:09:59,559 --> 00:10:03,058
<i>So James Hunt scores his
third major Formula 3 win</i>

150
00:10:03,059 --> 00:10:05,198
<i>of the season here,
at Crystal Palace,</i>

151
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,038
<i>after a desperate
battle with Niki Lauda.</i>

152
00:10:08,039 --> 00:10:10,038
<i>Lauda was unable so restart</i>

153
00:10:10,039 --> 00:10:12,938
<i>after Hunt's aggressive move
caused them both to spin out</i>

154
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:15,239
<i>in the last lap of the race.</i>

155
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,078
Hard luck. Better
luck next time.

156
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,200
Hey, asshole!

157
00:10:20,009 --> 00:10:22,379
That was my line. I
had that corner.

158
00:10:22,379 --> 00:10:24,149
You mean the one
that you spun out of

159
00:10:24,149 --> 00:10:25,989
and finished facing
the other way?

160
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:27,759
I think that corner had you.

161
00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:30,489
That move was total suicide.
What if I hadn't braked?

162
00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:33,229
- We'd have crashed.
- But we didn't, did we?

163
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:36,460
Thanks to your impeccable
survival instincts.

164
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,730
Fuck you! What's your name?

165
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,399
James Simon Wallis Hunt.

166
00:10:43,769 --> 00:10:46,038
Remember it, my
little Jerry friend.

167
00:10:46,039 --> 00:10:49,139
- Jawohl! Remember ze name.
- It's very simple.

168
00:10:49,139 --> 00:10:51,479
Hunt, it rhymes with cunt!

169
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:54,740
A word that happens to
describe you perfectly.

170
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:56,349
Who was that?

171
00:10:56,350 --> 00:10:59,649
I've no idea. He looks
like a rat, doesn't he?

172
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:02,719
<i>In my hometown, Vienna,</i>

173
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,028
<i>my family's famous
for one thing:</i>

174
00:11:05,029 --> 00:11:06,149
<i>Business.</i>

175
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:09,158
<i>My grandfather was
a businessman,</i>

176
00:11:09,159 --> 00:11:10,720
<i>my father, too.</i>

177
00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:14,629
<i>So when they heard I wanted
to race cars for a living,</i>

178
00:11:14,629 --> 00:11:16,500
<i>They are a few things to say.</i>

179
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:42,360
Good.

180
00:12:03,379 --> 00:12:06,019
<i>So if my family wasn't
going to help me,</i>

181
00:12:06,019 --> 00:12:09,558
<i>I decided to risk everything
and take out a Loan myself.</i>

182
00:12:09,559 --> 00:12:12,489
<i>I found a Formula 1
team with an Ok car</i>

183
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:14,798
<i>and an owner who had
run out of money</i>

184
00:12:14,799 --> 00:12:17,129
<i>and was willing to
accept my terms.</i>

185
00:12:17,129 --> 00:12:19,168
And so, ladies and gentlemen,

186
00:12:19,169 --> 00:12:20,969
I'm delighted to say...

187
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:23,639
that the winner of the Guild
of Motoring Writers Award.

188
00:12:23,639 --> 00:12:25,938
Driver of the Year...

189
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:27,340
is James Hunt.

190
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:32,070
Superb news!

191
00:12:33,009 --> 00:12:35,110
- Well done, James.
- Superstar!

192
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:36,480
Fantastic!

193
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:41,019
- Well done.
- Thank you so much.

194
00:12:41,019 --> 00:12:42,158
Yes!

195
00:12:42,159 --> 00:12:45,460
My parents always wanted
me to be a doctor

196
00:12:46,129 --> 00:12:48,698
or a stockbroker or something.
They gave me

197
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:51,969
the first-class education, but
that went all terribly wrong

198
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:54,399
and I ended up with you lot.

199
00:12:56,669 --> 00:12:59,470
Thank you. I need it
more than you do.

200
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:02,609
I mean, I have a hot head,

201
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:04,678
an inability to
tolerate discipline...

202
00:13:04,679 --> 00:13:06,379
- Yes!
- Very true!

203
00:13:06,379 --> 00:13:08,979
I fall out with people
left and right.

204
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:10,989
The only creatures
I've ever really loved

205
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:13,480
or treated honorably
are budgerigars.

206
00:13:15,019 --> 00:13:18,229
So in any normal area of
life, I'd be, or I am,

207
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:19,729
a total liability.

208
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:22,198
The only thing I've got going
for me is I'm quick in a car.

209
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,328
So thank you for this and
for acknowledging that.

210
00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:26,198
I'm going to give
it to my father

211
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,668
and tell him to put
it on the mantelpiece

212
00:13:27,669 --> 00:13:30,600
and imagine it's a first-class
degree in medicine.

213
00:13:45,049 --> 00:13:47,019
Well done, Superstar.

214
00:13:47,019 --> 00:13:48,359
Another season like that,

215
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,759
I'll move you up
to the big time.

216
00:13:49,759 --> 00:13:51,528
Come on, you don't
think I'm ready now?

217
00:13:51,529 --> 00:13:52,759
You are.

218
00:13:52,759 --> 00:13:55,099
I'm not. I've got to
find you a car first.

219
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:56,698
Well, go on, then.

220
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:58,399
Chop chop. Don't wait too long.

221
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:00,099
You don't want him to
do what Lauda just did.

222
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:03,038
- Why? What did he do?
- Got himself a drive, with BRM.

223
00:14:03,039 --> 00:14:05,139
How the hell did he do that?
He's a nobody.

224
00:14:05,139 --> 00:14:06,509
He's never won a bloody thing.

225
00:14:06,509 --> 00:14:08,609
Apparently, took out a
Loan and bought his way in

226
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:10,479
with two million
Austrian shillings.

227
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,639
Jesus.

228
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,099
Niki Lauda.

229
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:34,659
Here for pre-season testing.
BRM?

230
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:38,940
Sign the release form. I'll
let them know you're here.

231
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:52,019
- Mr. Stanley.
- Good morning.

232
00:14:52,019 --> 00:14:53,950
- Good morning.
- Clay!

233
00:14:54,659 --> 00:14:57,619
Let me introduce you to
our number one driver.

234
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:59,389
Clay Regazzoni.

235
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:02,990
- How are you?
- Good.

236
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,469
Pleasure.

237
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:07,028
And these are your mechanics.

238
00:15:07,029 --> 00:15:09,559
They're reporting
exclusively to you,

239
00:15:10,039 --> 00:15:11,509
as per contract.

240
00:15:11,509 --> 00:15:12,609
Pleasure.

241
00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:15,039
- Do you wanna see the car')
- Sure.

242
00:15:16,779 --> 00:15:17,740
Hello.

243
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:25,580
There she is. P160.

244
00:15:26,419 --> 00:15:29,879
- Same as Regazzoni's?
- Identical in every detail.

245
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:31,989
How much does she weigh?

246
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:34,558
- 600 kilos.
- But that's crazy.

247
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:37,259
- Why so heavy?
- It's a V12 engine.

248
00:15:37,259 --> 00:15:40,328
That lump weighs
190K on its own.

249
00:15:40,330 --> 00:15:41,299
Okay.

250
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:44,969
What horsepower are you getting?

251
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:47,568
- No, no, 450.
- It's not enough.

252
00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:49,009
It needs to be 500.

253
00:15:49,009 --> 00:15:50,639
And the engine needs to be.

254
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:52,479
- We already tried.
- Tried what?

255
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,479
Everything

256
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,979
We replaced the entire
exhaust system.

257
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:58,580
- Barely made the difference.
- Are you using magnesium parts?

258
00:16:11,429 --> 00:16:12,729
Now the engine block.

259
00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:15,668
Any mounting or fixing
plates, strip it out also.

260
00:16:15,669 --> 00:16:17,099
When you've done that,

261
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:19,038
we have to look at
the aerodynamics,

262
00:16:19,039 --> 00:16:20,730
front and rear wing.

263
00:16:37,929 --> 00:16:40,289
Okay, thank you. Good night.

264
00:17:00,309 --> 00:17:02,580
What was Regazzoni's time?

265
00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:05,189
1:53.

266
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:08,489
Okay, now put him in my car and
he'll go 2 seconds faster.

267
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:11,460
- Well, that's impossible.
- No chance.

268
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:16,598
We've been working
on it all night.

269
00:17:16,599 --> 00:17:19,068
Put Regazzoni in the car.
See what happens.

270
00:17:19,069 --> 00:17:20,528
I don't understand. Why
am I supposed to do this?

271
00:17:20,529 --> 00:17:21,538
I don't know, Clay.

272
00:17:21,539 --> 00:17:24,029
He wants you to
take it for a spin.

273
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:26,430
Gloves, please.

274
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:15,019
- I'd say we push it...
- All right.

275
00:18:15,019 --> 00:18:17,288
What did you do to the car?

276
00:18:17,289 --> 00:18:19,128
That's information
I'll share with you

277
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:21,088
under certain conditions only.

278
00:18:21,089 --> 00:18:22,119
Go on.

279
00:18:23,329 --> 00:18:25,368
A guaranteed place in the team.

280
00:18:25,369 --> 00:18:27,068
And a paid contract
on equal terms

281
00:18:27,069 --> 00:18:29,368
with Regazzoni for two years.

282
00:18:29,369 --> 00:18:30,898
Are you crazy?

283
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:33,269
Clay's a senior figure in F1.

284
00:18:33,269 --> 00:18:34,939
You're just a rookie!

285
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:37,608
The only reason we took you on
is because you're paying us.

286
00:18:37,609 --> 00:18:39,979
Well, as of now, if
you want me to stay,

287
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:42,479
we rip up the contract,
I don't pay you a cent.

288
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,318
That's outrageous!

289
00:18:44,319 --> 00:18:46,579
Was he quicker in my car?

290
00:18:47,049 --> 00:18:49,019
He was, wasn't he?

291
00:18:49,589 --> 00:18:52,109
Did he go two seconds faster?

292
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,890
Two point three.

293
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:02,169
So, have a think,

294
00:19:02,170 --> 00:19:05,299
work out your priorities
and get back to me.

295
00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:20,650
Hey, Niki.

296
00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:26,588
I know what you're going to say,
that it's none of my business.

297
00:19:26,589 --> 00:19:27,559
What?

298
00:19:28,930 --> 00:19:32,329
If it's the track manager you're
taking on your date tonight.

299
00:19:33,269 --> 00:19:35,038
It's none of your business.

300
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:37,269
Okay, but if you want my advice,

301
00:19:37,269 --> 00:19:39,069
I'd let this one go.

302
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:43,200
I'm not questioning your taste.
She is a great girl, but...

303
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:47,409
Agnes' last boyfriend

304
00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:49,578
was a British Formula 2 driver

305
00:19:49,579 --> 00:19:51,989
who has a reputation
for two things,

306
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:54,548
for being a little
crazy on the track...

307
00:19:54,549 --> 00:19:57,288
and for going all
night and all day

308
00:19:57,289 --> 00:19:59,989
and all night again in bed.
He's a good driver,

309
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:02,358
but an immortal fuck apparently.

310
00:20:02,359 --> 00:20:04,298
I don't know about you,
but that's not an act

311
00:20:04,299 --> 00:20:06,319
I'd like to follow.

312
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:11,099
But if that doesn't
bother you...

313
00:20:12,509 --> 00:20:15,200
What's his name, the driver?

314
00:20:16,109 --> 00:20:17,910
Hunt. James Hunt.

315
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:23,979
You see, you share information

316
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:25,980
and I share information.

317
00:20:26,289 --> 00:20:28,619
That's what teammates are for.

318
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,299
- Where the hell are we going?
- I promise it'll be worth it.

319
00:20:42,670 --> 00:20:44,439
Just keep them closed.

320
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:45,630
Wait for it.

321
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:48,109
Wait for it.

322
00:20:52,049 --> 00:20:53,048
There.

323
00:20:53,049 --> 00:20:54,309
What do you say?

324
00:20:54,609 --> 00:20:56,210
She's Formula 1.

325
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,719
Yes, she is, Superstar.

326
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:01,659
Your brother and I got together
with the bean counters.

327
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:03,719
And since the economics
of F1 are not

328
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:06,429
so significantly different
to the economics of F2,

329
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:09,328
well, we thought if we were
going to be losing money,

330
00:21:09,329 --> 00:21:12,469
we might as well be doing it on
the big roulette table in F1.

331
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:15,730
You fat, little, inbred beauty.
Come here.

332
00:21:20,109 --> 00:21:23,679
Actually, credit where it's
due, we got the idea from Niki.

333
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,278
- Who?
- Lauda.

334
00:21:25,279 --> 00:21:27,679
Bought his way in
rather than mess about

335
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,078
in the lower divisions.
I thought

336
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:30,378
"Bloody hell, he's right."

337
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:32,288
No sponsorship, Superstar.

338
00:21:32,289 --> 00:21:33,648
I hope you approve.

339
00:21:33,650 --> 00:21:37,380
No vulgar logos for
cigarettes or condoms.

340
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:40,189
Just plain white with the flags.

341
00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:42,250
And racing overalls

342
00:21:43,259 --> 00:21:44,390
which read

343
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:47,660
"Sex. Breakfast of champions."

344
00:21:50,069 --> 00:21:51,630
So when do we start?

345
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:55,409
- Soon as you're ready.
- Ready?

346
00:21:55,410 --> 00:21:58,069
I've been waiting for
this my whole life.

347
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:01,309
VILLAGE OF WATKINS GLEN

348
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:11,259
<i>When the season started,
people wondered</i>

349
00:22:11,259 --> 00:22:13,128
<i>whether Lord Hesketh
and his team</i>

350
00:22:13,130 --> 00:22:15,528
<i>of upper-class enthusiasts
were bringing glamour</i>

351
00:22:15,529 --> 00:22:18,329
<i>to the racing community
or just comedy.</i>

352
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:21,068
<i>Certainly it was the first
time anyone had seen</i>

353
00:22:21,069 --> 00:22:24,200
<i>a Butler sewing oysters
and caviar in the pits.</i>

354
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:27,368
<i>But they have made
quite an impact.</i>

355
00:22:27,369 --> 00:22:30,979
<i>6th in France, 4th in
Britain and 3rd in Holland.</i>

356
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:34,108
<i>All drivers on the track,
caution flags are out.</i>

357
00:22:34,109 --> 00:22:36,648
<i>A severe crash at the Esses.</i>

358
00:22:36,650 --> 00:22:39,088
<i>Red flag. There's a
car off the track.</i>

359
00:22:39,089 --> 00:22:41,088
<i>And reports are reaching
me that there's been</i>

360
00:22:41,089 --> 00:22:43,318
<i>a serious accident
in qualifying.</i>

361
00:22:43,319 --> 00:22:45,528
<i>The identity of the driver
we don't currently have,</i>

362
00:22:45,529 --> 00:22:48,398
<i>but as you can tell from
all the activity going on</i>

363
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:52,128
<i>towards the track, it was clearly
a grave incident indeed.</i>

364
00:22:52,130 --> 00:22:54,699
<i>We will, of course, have more
information as we get it,</i>

365
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:58,160
<i>but it is the sight and sound
of F1 nobody likes to see.</i>

366
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:05,170
- Get your hands off me!
- Hey, come on!

367
00:23:14,519 --> 00:23:18,058
<i>Drivers of top stature we've
lost just in the past 4 seasons</i>

368
00:23:18,059 --> 00:23:20,250
<i>have included Piers Courage,</i>

369
00:23:20,529 --> 00:23:21,619
<i>Jochen Rindt,</i>

370
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:23,690
<i>Jo Siffert,</i>

<i>Roger Williamson</i>

372
00:23:26,099 --> 00:23:28,239
<i>and today, at Watkins Glen,</i>

373
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,140
<i>Formula 1 has claimed
another driver.</i>

374
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:34,169
<i>The Tyrrell team have
withdrawn from the race.</i>

375
00:23:34,170 --> 00:23:36,479
<i>Their places on the grid
will be left empty.</i>

376
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:39,148
- Terrible.
- They should cancel the race.

377
00:23:39,150 --> 00:23:40,130
Why?

378
00:23:40,650 --> 00:23:43,648
He made a mistake, went
into the corner too fast.

379
00:23:43,650 --> 00:23:45,019
It's his fault.

380
00:23:45,019 --> 00:23:47,249
- Is that right?
- It's obvious.

381
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:49,318
Look at the tyre marks.

382
00:23:49,319 --> 00:23:52,659
So says the nobody, who had
to pay for his own drive.

383
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:54,588
How's that working out
for you, by the way?

384
00:23:54,589 --> 00:23:55,690
Fine.

385
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:58,128
How is it at the back?

386
00:23:58,130 --> 00:24:00,599
Not planning on being
there for long.

387
00:24:01,470 --> 00:24:04,299
Ten minutes to the warm-up lap.
Ten minutes.

388
00:24:07,539 --> 00:24:08,730
Arsehole.

389
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:13,778
<i>Heading into the Grand Hotel
hairpin, second gear.</i>

390
00:24:13,779 --> 00:24:16,778
<i>Turn in hard, looking
for late apex,</i>

391
00:24:16,779 --> 00:24:18,440
<i>gentle with the bar.</i>

392
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:21,588
<i>Heading into Portier,
second gear,</i>

393
00:24:21,589 --> 00:24:22,919
<i>clip the apex,</i>

394
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,659
<i>light brake, stay in second,</i>

395
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:26,558
<i>looking for a good exit.</i>

396
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:28,499
<i>Heading through the
tunnel, gradual right,</i>

397
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:31,459
<i>up through third,
fourth, fifth...</i>

398
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:33,299
ls Alexander around?

399
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,059
Yes, he was.

400
00:24:36,599 --> 00:24:38,608
He went back to the
house to take a call.

401
00:24:38,609 --> 00:24:40,308
He'll be back shortly.

402
00:24:40,309 --> 00:24:43,308
He only wanted to show
me his pride and Joy.

403
00:24:43,309 --> 00:24:46,009
Rhymes with 'boy' if you ask me.

404
00:24:46,009 --> 00:24:47,269
And 'toy.'

405
00:24:48,009 --> 00:24:49,719
God, it's so flimsy.

406
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:52,318
For something that
costs so much.

407
00:24:52,319 --> 00:24:56,019
There's no comfort, no
protection, nothing.

408
00:24:56,359 --> 00:24:59,058
No, it's just a little
coffin, really.

409
00:24:59,059 --> 00:25:01,960
Surrounded by high-octane
fuel in here.

410
00:25:02,259 --> 00:25:04,960
Being driven round 170 mph.

411
00:25:05,269 --> 00:25:08,599
To all intents and purposes,
this thing's a bomb on wheels.

412
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,430
You're James, aren't you?

413
00:25:12,769 --> 00:25:13,740
Yes.

414
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:17,109
You fit the description.

415
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,710
Is that right?

416
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:22,019
Suzy. Friend of Alex's.

417
00:25:22,019 --> 00:25:23,210
Yeah, yeah.

418
00:25:23,650 --> 00:25:25,279
I know exactly.

419
00:25:26,690 --> 00:25:28,558
What was the description?

420
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:30,219
Mostly positive in
terms of appearance.

421
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:32,429
Negative only in
terms of character.

422
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:34,890
I've been told to avoid you.

423
00:25:35,130 --> 00:25:36,289
By whom?

424
00:25:36,930 --> 00:25:38,199
Alexander.

425
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:40,229
He says you're a bad boy.

426
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:42,338
Alexander doesn't know
what he's talking about.

427
00:25:42,339 --> 00:25:44,398
I was. I'm not anymore.

428
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,469
The new me is very professional.

429
00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:48,209
Early to bed, early to rise.

430
00:25:48,210 --> 00:25:49,539
All very dull,

431
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:51,378
but according to the team,

432
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:54,509
the best way to keep beating
the goose stepper.'

433
00:25:54,509 --> 00:25:56,449
Is that what you were
doing when I came in?

434
00:25:56,450 --> 00:25:59,388
Yes, visualization techniques,
memorising the circuit,

435
00:25:59,390 --> 00:26:02,119
in this case Monaco,
which is up next.

436
00:26:06,990 --> 00:26:09,429
Personally I've always
been a great believer

437
00:26:09,430 --> 00:26:11,358
in getting there on the
day, putting my foot down

438
00:26:11,359 --> 00:26:13,589
and playing chicken
with everyone else.

439
00:26:15,099 --> 00:26:16,669
But they don't want me
doing that anymore.

440
00:26:16,670 --> 00:26:20,299
They want my body like a Temple
and my mind like a monk.

441
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:23,638
And what about your
soul, your heart?

442
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:26,039
They've got ideas
about that, too.

443
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,618
They want me to stop
messing around,

444
00:26:28,619 --> 00:26:31,949
settle down, get married with
the next nice girl I meet.

445
00:26:31,950 --> 00:26:34,148
They think that'd
be good for me.

446
00:26:34,150 --> 00:26:35,659
What do you think?

447
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:37,680
It sounds fucking awful.

448
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:42,699
But sine they're right
about most things,

449
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:45,160
they're probably right
about that too.

450
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:48,400
You don't fancy getting
married, do you?

451
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:14,430
Suzy.

452
00:27:15,259 --> 00:27:16,990
JUST MARRIED

453
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:19,460
Hey, hey, hey!

454
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:25,209
- What's going on with him?
- Nothing. Nothing.

455
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:27,209
Didn't want to ruin your day.

456
00:27:27,210 --> 00:27:28,329
It's...

457
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:31,109
- it's the Kraut.
- What about him?

458
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:34,308
He's just been
signed by Ferrari.

459
00:27:34,309 --> 00:27:36,180
You're kidding me?

460
00:27:36,549 --> 00:27:38,348
Jesus. How did that happen?

461
00:27:38,349 --> 00:27:40,148
Did he buy his way in there too?

462
00:27:40,150 --> 00:27:43,019
Well, the old man
took Regazzoni back

463
00:27:43,019 --> 00:27:45,229
and he insisted
on it apparently.

464
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:48,420
He says that Niki's a
genius setting up the cars.

465
00:27:55,970 --> 00:27:58,339
FERRARI TEST TRACK
FIORANO, ITALY

466
00:28:06,710 --> 00:28:09,179
It's terrible.
Drives like a pig.

467
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:12,088
- You can't say that.
- Why not?

468
00:28:12,089 --> 00:28:14,588
- It's a Ferrari!
- It's a shitbox!

469
00:28:14,589 --> 00:28:16,618
It understeers like crazy
and the weight distribution

470
00:28:16,619 --> 00:28:18,088
is a disaster.

471
00:28:18,089 --> 00:28:19,489
It's amazing, all
these facilities

472
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:21,930
and you make a piece
of crap like this.

473
00:28:52,430 --> 00:28:54,128
"Ferrari family,"

474
00:28:54,130 --> 00:28:55,929
"our good friend
Clay Regazzoni."

475
00:28:55,930 --> 00:28:58,259
You are family and friend
to the commendatore

476
00:28:58,259 --> 00:28:59,598
as long as you win.

477
00:28:59,599 --> 00:29:01,199
The minute you
don't, ciao, ciao.

478
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,699
I totally understand.

479
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:04,098
It's business.

480
00:29:04,099 --> 00:29:05,509
I would do the same.

481
00:29:05,509 --> 00:29:07,709
But it isn't just
business, is it?

482
00:29:07,710 --> 00:29:10,338
What we do. It's passion, love.

483
00:29:10,339 --> 00:29:13,308
Which is why we are prepared
to risk our lives for it.

484
00:29:13,309 --> 00:29:14,348
Not me.

485
00:29:14,349 --> 00:29:16,519
If I had more talent and
could earn better money

486
00:29:16,519 --> 00:29:18,989
with something else, I would.

487
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:20,989
How do you know you
will make money here?

488
00:29:20,990 --> 00:29:22,659
You haven't yet.

489
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:24,849
Not yet, but I will.

490
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:28,019
If you can, I can.

491
00:29:31,259 --> 00:29:34,200
You know, are you
ever not an asshole?

492
00:29:34,529 --> 00:29:36,538
- Why am I an asshole?
- Well...

493
00:29:36,539 --> 00:29:40,108
By now I'm both quicker than you
and better at setting up a car.

494
00:29:40,109 --> 00:29:42,378
You can't deal with it,
so you're the asshole.

495
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:43,640
Screw you.

496
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:52,419
I brought you along today

497
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:54,449
because you seem like
a lonely kind of guy.

498
00:29:54,450 --> 00:29:56,618
I thought if I introduced
you to some nice people,

499
00:29:56,619 --> 00:29:58,318
that could rub off on you.

500
00:29:58,319 --> 00:29:59,489
Forget it.

501
00:29:59,490 --> 00:30:01,128
Make your own friends.

502
00:30:01,130 --> 00:30:02,558
Come on, Clay.

503
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:03,960
I'm sorry.

504
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:41,130
Are you leaving?

505
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:42,970
Yes.

506
00:30:43,470 --> 00:30:45,469
Can you give me a lift
to the nearest town,

507
00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:48,000
anywhere with a train station?

508
00:30:48,410 --> 00:30:49,380
Sure.

509
00:30:50,009 --> 00:30:52,308
Trento's half an hour's drive.

510
00:30:52,309 --> 00:30:53,339
Get in.

511
00:31:20,369 --> 00:31:22,038
What are you doing?

512
00:31:22,039 --> 00:31:24,108
You hear that noise
when you accelerate?

513
00:31:24,109 --> 00:31:26,378
- No.
- Your fan belt is loose.

514
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:27,609
My What?

515
00:31:28,079 --> 00:31:30,648
And when you brake, your
foot goes all the way down,

516
00:31:30,650 --> 00:31:32,489
which means there's
air in the system.

517
00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:34,650
- Anything else?
- No.

518
00:31:35,619 --> 00:31:38,319
Apart from the rear
brakes are worn out,

519
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,588
the front right
tyre is a bit soft,

520
00:31:40,589 --> 00:31:43,190
which explains why
you're weaving so much.

521
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:45,229
How can you tell?

522
00:31:45,230 --> 00:31:47,098
- My ass.
- Sorry?

523
00:31:47,099 --> 00:31:49,298
God gave me an Ok mind,

524
00:31:49,299 --> 00:31:52,338
but a really good ass which
can feel everything in a car.

525
00:31:52,339 --> 00:31:53,969
You don't know what
you're talking about.

526
00:31:53,970 --> 00:31:56,439
This car is fine. I just
had a service a week ago.

527
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:57,509
Not a good one.

528
00:31:57,509 --> 00:32:00,378
Yes, a very good
one, very expensive.

529
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:02,940
This car's as good as new.
Relax.

530
00:32:10,089 --> 00:32:12,558
- You're not in a hurry, are you?
- No.

531
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:15,390
As long as I'm back in
Maranello Monday morning.

532
00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:32,000
Yes.

533
00:33:41,950 --> 00:33:44,749
- Actually, we do, yeah.
- It's my honor, Niki.

534
00:33:44,750 --> 00:33:47,219
- Thank you.
- My car is your car.

535
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:49,159
On one condition, though.

536
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:51,189
It's a piece of shit.
It's dog shit.

537
00:33:51,190 --> 00:33:54,180
But if you drive it, you
make my life, Niki, eh?

538
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:13,509
Would someone please
tell me what's going on?

539
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:16,449
- Who are you? Should I know you?
- What, you don't know?

540
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:19,418
He's Niki Lauda,
Formula 1 driver,

541
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:21,248
and he just signed with Ferrari.

542
00:34:21,250 --> 00:34:22,588
- Him?
- Yes.

543
00:34:22,590 --> 00:34:24,588
- Impossible.
- Why?

544
00:34:24,590 --> 00:34:27,088
Well, you know,
Formula 1 drivers,

545
00:34:27,090 --> 00:34:29,298
they have long hair, are sexy...

546
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:31,228
their shins are open to here.

547
00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:32,929
- Thank you.
- Yes.

548
00:34:32,929 --> 00:34:36,269
Anyway, look at the way he's
driving, like an old man.

549
00:34:40,570 --> 00:34:42,409
There's no need to drive fast.

550
00:34:42,409 --> 00:34:45,108
It just increases the
percentage of risk.

551
00:34:45,110 --> 00:34:47,278
We're not in a hurry.
I'm not being paid.

552
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:50,048
Right now, with zero
incentive or reward,

553
00:34:50,050 --> 00:34:52,039
why would I drive fast?

554
00:34:53,619 --> 00:34:56,019
Because I'm asking you to.

555
00:35:59,519 --> 00:36:02,518
<i>This is an incredible
battle between Niki Lauda</i>

556
00:36:02,519 --> 00:36:04,958
<i>in the red Ferrari
and James Hunt</i>

557
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:06,929
<i>in the white Hesketh.</i>

558
00:36:07,659 --> 00:36:09,429
<i>...the challenge
of Niki Lauda...</i>

559
00:36:09,429 --> 00:36:12,469
<i>Lauda attacking Hunt. He
gets through on the inside.</i>

560
00:36:12,469 --> 00:36:14,268
<i>Goes wide at the exit.</i>

561
00:36:14,269 --> 00:36:15,739
<i>Hunt is past again.</i>

562
00:36:15,739 --> 00:36:19,009
<i>Once more, Lauda tries
to sneak up the inside.</i>

563
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:22,378
<i>They're absolutely side
by side, wheel to wheel.</i>

564
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:24,338
<i>So evenly matched.</i>

565
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:27,208
<i>Fantastic battle between
these two great drivers.</i>

566
00:36:27,210 --> 00:36:29,440
<i>Hunt is now ahead once more.</i>

567
00:36:30,579 --> 00:36:32,588
<i>But Lauda's coming
back again now.</i>

568
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:35,449
<i>Lauda once more
sneaks up the inside.</i>

569
00:36:35,449 --> 00:36:38,458
<i>And again he runs wide.
Again the Hesketh...</i>

570
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:41,650
- Suzy, we're ready, come on.
- Just one second.

571
00:36:42,090 --> 00:36:44,889
- Can we go, yeah?
- Okay, yeah.

572
00:36:45,329 --> 00:36:48,469
<i>We're in the closing laps of
this race at Watkins Glen.</i>

573
00:36:48,469 --> 00:36:50,329
<i>They come down the hill.</i>

574
00:36:51,070 --> 00:36:53,009
<i>And Hunt's got a problem!</i>

575
00:36:53,010 --> 00:36:55,469
<i>Hunt pulls across to the left!</i>

576
00:36:55,469 --> 00:36:58,309
<i>Lauda goes ahead on his own.</i>

577
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:02,309
<i>A sad end to a wonderful battle.</i>

578
00:37:02,309 --> 00:37:05,010
<i>Hunt pushing off the marshal.</i>

579
00:37:13,429 --> 00:37:16,128
<i>The chequered flag
is waiting for Lauda</i>

580
00:37:16,130 --> 00:37:17,559
<i>and for Ferrari!</i>

581
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,969
<i>The title going to Niki Lauda,</i>

582
00:37:21,969 --> 00:37:23,369
<i>who wins the race,</i>

583
00:37:23,369 --> 00:37:26,599
<i>who wins the World Championship.</i>

584
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:42,139
Do I look like a
racing driver now?

585
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:10,179
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

586
00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:12,380
Marlene.

587
00:38:13,949 --> 00:38:16,059
With a car like that,
the rest of us

588
00:38:16,059 --> 00:38:18,188
never stood a chance, did we?

589
00:38:18,190 --> 00:38:21,188
Maybe the car being so good
has something to do with me.

590
00:38:21,190 --> 00:38:22,958
Come on, Niki.
You're in a Ferrari.

591
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:24,228
I'm in a Hesketh.

592
00:38:24,230 --> 00:38:26,068
Equal terms, the way
it was in Formula 3,

593
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:28,429
- Id' beat you and you know it.
- Never.

594
00:38:28,429 --> 00:38:30,599
You might win one
race, maybe two,

595
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:32,039
because you're aggressive.

596
00:38:32,039 --> 00:38:33,969
But in the long run, over
the course of a season,

597
00:38:33,969 --> 00:38:35,108
no chance.

598
00:38:35,110 --> 00:38:36,378
Right. Why is that?

599
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:38,039
Because to be a champion,

600
00:38:38,039 --> 00:38:39,349
it takes more than
just being quick.

601
00:38:39,349 --> 00:38:40,978
It's the whole picture.

602
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:43,248
You're just a charger
and a party guy.

603
00:38:43,250 --> 00:38:44,949
That's why everybody likes you.

604
00:38:44,949 --> 00:38:47,889
Try saying that and tell
me you're not jealous.

605
00:38:48,090 --> 00:38:50,958
Why would I be jealous?
Think about it.

606
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:53,259
All that affection,
all those smiles,

607
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:55,228
is a sign of disrespect.

608
00:38:55,230 --> 00:38:57,958
They don't fear you. Whereas
compared that to me.

609
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:00,369
Yes, compared to you,
whom no one likes.

610
00:39:00,369 --> 00:39:02,199
- Right.
- Not even his own teammates.

611
00:39:02,199 --> 00:39:05,039
Right. Because I'm
a serious guy.

612
00:39:05,039 --> 00:39:07,708
I go to bed early, I look
after myself, after my car.

613
00:39:07,710 --> 00:39:10,708
- Yes, you're very well-behaved.
- Go to work, kick ass.

614
00:39:10,710 --> 00:39:12,338
And then, after the
race, I go home

615
00:39:12,340 --> 00:39:13,949
instead of going to bars

616
00:39:13,949 --> 00:39:16,719
and talk all this bullshit
with all these assholes.

617
00:39:16,719 --> 00:39:18,110
Arseholes?

618
00:39:18,449 --> 00:39:20,980
You should go home
more often too.

619
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:26,190
I heard you got married.

620
00:39:27,429 --> 00:39:28,980
Yes, I did.

621
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:33,429
So where is she, this
mysterious wife?

622
00:39:34,170 --> 00:39:35,929
In New York, working.

623
00:39:37,539 --> 00:39:40,039
You know, I've never
seen you with her once.

624
00:39:40,039 --> 00:39:41,230
No?

625
00:39:43,210 --> 00:39:46,208
Well, maybe that's because
you're always at home,

626
00:39:46,210 --> 00:39:48,378
on your own, looking
after yourself,

627
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:50,369
being a good little boy.

628
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:56,519
Take a drink on me, James.

629
00:39:57,489 --> 00:40:00,389
Thank you, Niki. I
might just have two.

630
00:40:11,239 --> 00:40:12,668
Right, Bubbles,

631
00:40:12,670 --> 00:40:15,338
whatever it takes to beat
that prick next year,

632
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:16,608
just say it,

633
00:40:16,610 --> 00:40:18,378
you're word is my command.

634
00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:20,679
There are no lengths to
which I will not go.

635
00:40:20,679 --> 00:40:22,309
And I mean it.

636
00:40:24,119 --> 00:40:26,280
What the hell's going on?

637
00:40:28,150 --> 00:40:30,018
Where is everybody?

638
00:40:30,019 --> 00:40:31,550
What's the matter?

639
00:40:36,230 --> 00:40:38,628
Do you know what the
date it is today?

640
00:40:38,630 --> 00:40:41,498
Yes. It's November, the 14th.
Why?

641
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:45,369
Do you have any idea of the
significance of that date?

642
00:40:47,170 --> 00:40:50,570
I don't know. Time to
start killing pheasants?

643
00:40:52,610 --> 00:40:55,748
Actually, it's the deadline
for securing sponsorship

644
00:40:55,750 --> 00:40:58,449
for the forthcoming
Formula 1 season.

645
00:40:58,449 --> 00:40:59,449
Yes?

646
00:40:59,449 --> 00:41:01,518
Which elapsed at
midnight last night

647
00:41:01,519 --> 00:41:03,989
- and we didn't attract any.
- Well, so?

648
00:41:03,989 --> 00:41:06,289
We aren't looking
for sponsorship.

649
00:41:06,289 --> 00:41:10,130
Like you said, condoms an
cigarettes, vulgar, right?

650
00:41:10,460 --> 00:41:11,429
Right.

651
00:41:13,329 --> 00:41:15,630
Except we are, or were.

652
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:21,630
I've made something
of a miscalculation.

653
00:41:22,039 --> 00:41:25,170
The economics, Formula
1, realities thereof.

654
00:41:26,579 --> 00:41:30,210
It turns out not like the
lower divisions at all.

655
00:41:32,250 --> 00:41:34,050
What are you saying?

656
00:41:36,019 --> 00:41:38,650
I'm saying it's over, Superstar.

657
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:43,289
The banks have stepped in,
started laying everyone off.

658
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:47,059
Probably have to
sell this place.

659
00:41:48,030 --> 00:41:49,300
On, Christ.

660
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:34,269
I need a drive, Pete. I need
you to find me a drive.

661
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:36,639
I mean, what about Lotus?

662
00:42:37,179 --> 00:42:38,949
You don't wanna know.

663
00:42:38,949 --> 00:42:41,110
- Actually, I do.
- Okay.

664
00:42:43,690 --> 00:42:46,289
They felt your
reputation preceded you.

665
00:42:46,289 --> 00:42:48,230
And what does that mean?

666
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:52,690
It's my other line. Look,
I'll get back to you.

667
00:42:55,030 --> 00:42:56,139
Peter Hunt.

668
00:42:56,139 --> 00:42:57,099
Fuck!

669
00:43:08,309 --> 00:43:11,210
Don't worry. Something
will turn up.

670
00:43:18,420 --> 00:43:21,190
Doubt that will help
in the meantime.

671
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:26,168
Why don't we go away
at the weekend?

672
00:43:26,170 --> 00:43:27,289
Skiing.

673
00:43:27,929 --> 00:43:30,130
Before I go back to New York.

674
00:43:33,010 --> 00:43:36,108
Talk to me, James. Don't
make a stranger of me.

675
00:43:36,110 --> 00:43:39,670
You know, Suzy, only a stranger
would invite me skiing

676
00:43:40,610 --> 00:43:44,010
when they know I haven't
got a fucking drivel

677
00:43:49,590 --> 00:43:51,280
I can't watch this.

678
00:43:51,989 --> 00:43:54,659
What were you hoping for anyway?

679
00:43:54,659 --> 00:43:57,259
A well-adjusted knight
in shining armour?

680
00:43:57,260 --> 00:43:58,989
No danger of that.

681
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:01,498
- Let me give you some advice.
- I'm all ears.

682
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:03,469
Don't go to men who are
willing to kill themselves

683
00:44:03,469 --> 00:44:05,768
driving in circles
looking for normality.

684
00:44:05,769 --> 00:44:07,438
I never expected normality.

685
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:09,478
God knows I walked into
this with my eyes open.

686
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:12,179
I just hoped I'd married someone
who is half as impressive

687
00:44:12,179 --> 00:44:14,208
on the inside as he
is on the outside!

688
00:44:14,210 --> 00:44:16,248
At least there's something
behind the facade.

689
00:44:16,250 --> 00:44:19,318
- James.
- Fuck off to New York, dear.

690
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:21,619
There must be a moisturiser
or an eye shadow somewhere

691
00:44:21,619 --> 00:44:24,559
that needs your vapid
mush to flog it.

692
00:45:00,130 --> 00:45:01,728
- Hello?
- Hi, James.

693
00:45:01,730 --> 00:45:04,920
It's Peter. Something's
up at McLaren.

694
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:07,969
- What have you heard?
- Nothing. Why?

695
00:45:07,969 --> 00:45:10,969
I heard Emerson's off.
He's dumped them in it.

696
00:45:10,969 --> 00:45:13,108
Jesus. Get me in there, Pete.

697
00:45:13,110 --> 00:45:15,400
Say anything, just
get me in that room.

698
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:22,449
I'll come straight to the point.

699
00:45:22,449 --> 00:45:25,478
- Our esteemed lead driver...
- Fitti-fucking-paldi.

700
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:28,119
Has ditched us for another
team at the last minute.

701
00:45:28,119 --> 00:45:30,389
- Coper-fucking-sucar.
- And we need a replacement.

702
00:45:30,389 --> 00:45:32,449
Asa-fucking-P.

703
00:45:33,230 --> 00:45:35,958
Fortunately a few hands
have already gone up,

704
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:37,298
good people.

705
00:45:37,300 --> 00:45:40,230
- Jacky Ickx.
- I'm quicker than Jacky.

706
00:45:40,469 --> 00:45:43,369
But he's consistent, dependable.

707
00:45:43,369 --> 00:45:44,639
A grown-up.

708
00:45:44,639 --> 00:45:48,108
Right, and will he go for that
gap when no one else will?

709
00:45:48,110 --> 00:45:50,938
Will he put his life on the
line the day it really matters?

710
00:45:50,940 --> 00:45:52,509
The sponsors like him.

711
00:45:52,510 --> 00:45:54,608
What do you want, a driver
or a brush salesman?

712
00:45:54,610 --> 00:45:56,679
- We wanna be successful.
- Yes, so do I.

713
00:45:56,679 --> 00:45:58,219
But that means
beating Niki Lauda,

714
00:45:58,219 --> 00:46:00,018
not being a show
pony for sponsors.

715
00:46:00,019 --> 00:46:01,688
I heard about this
thing with Niki.

716
00:46:01,690 --> 00:46:03,150
Everyone has.

717
00:46:03,619 --> 00:46:05,219
You really thing
you can beat him?

718
00:46:05,219 --> 00:46:06,528
I'd beat him in a McLaren.

719
00:46:06,530 --> 00:46:09,460
It's the only car out there
as quick as the Ferrari.

720
00:46:09,730 --> 00:46:12,259
Which is why I'm here, begging.

721
00:46:12,260 --> 00:46:13,699
I'll do whatever you ask.

722
00:46:13,699 --> 00:46:15,969
I'll put on a tie, I'll
smile for sponsors,

723
00:46:15,969 --> 00:46:17,969
say the right things.

724
00:46:17,969 --> 00:46:20,400
I can beat this guy, trust me.

725
00:46:21,110 --> 00:46:23,409
Just give me the drive.

726
00:46:23,409 --> 00:46:25,639
Yeah, he can be a loose canon.

727
00:46:25,639 --> 00:46:28,048
And, yeah, he will
drive you all mad,

728
00:46:28,050 --> 00:46:31,179
but in terms of raw
talent and right stuff,

729
00:46:31,179 --> 00:46:33,449
there is no better
driver in the world.

730
00:46:33,449 --> 00:46:35,688
He's the real thing, Teddy.

731
00:46:35,690 --> 00:46:38,289
He's what we all
came into this for.

732
00:46:38,289 --> 00:46:40,588
Nine days out of ten you'll
be pulling your hair out,

733
00:46:40,590 --> 00:46:43,659
but on that tenth day
James will be unbeatable.

734
00:46:43,659 --> 00:46:46,259
That is the day you will wish
you had him in your car.

735
00:46:46,260 --> 00:46:49,099
<i>You'll never win the
championship with Jacky Ickx.</i>

736
00:46:49,099 --> 00:46:51,900
You just might with James.

1976 Formula 1 season,</i>

741
00:47:19,769 --> 00:47:23,099

Hunt qualified fastest,</i>

742
00:47:23,099 --> 00:47:25,568
<i>beating Niki Lauda's
Ferrari to pole position</i>

743
00:47:25,570 --> 00:47:28,300

744
00:47:29,639 --> 00:47:30,969
New car.

745
00:47:31,380 --> 00:47:33,539
- I noticed.
- Pole position.

746
00:47:34,179 --> 00:47:35,648
I noticed that too.

747
00:47:35,650 --> 00:47:38,418
Level playing field now,
my rally little friend.

748
00:47:38,420 --> 00:47:39,418
Yeah.

749
00:47:39,420 --> 00:47:41,648
Let's see where we
are after lap one.

750
00:47:41,650 --> 00:47:44,420
Let's see where we are
in five races time.

751
00:47:45,260 --> 00:47:47,628
<i>Hunt has the pit
Lane pole position,</i>

752
00:47:47,630 --> 00:47:49,259
<i>which should give
him the best chance</i>

753
00:47:49,260 --> 00:47:51,429
<i>of outdragging Lauda's Ferrari.</i>

754
00:47:51,429 --> 00:47:53,268
<i>If ever there was a doubt about</i>

755
00:47:53,269 --> 00:47:56,329
<i>whether Lauda had a serious
challenger to this season,</i>

756
00:47:56,329 --> 00:47:59,630
<i>Hunt and his McLaren have
certainly given us the answer.</i>

GRAND PRIX SOUTH AFRICA 76

<i>Here in South Africa,
James Hunt is determined</i>

761
00:48:18,590 --> 00:48:22,119
<i>to make amends after that
disastrous retirement in Brazil.</i>

762
00:48:23,230 --> 00:48:26,898
<i>But it's Lauda who takes
the flag here at Kyalami.</i>

763
00:48:26,900 --> 00:48:28,929
<i>James Hunt comes home second</i>

764

Next time I'll have you.

768
00:48:42,079 --> 00:48:43,880
We'll see in Spain.

769
00:49:00,570 --> 00:49:03,360
SPAIN-HUNT WINS LAUDA 2ND

770
00:49:04,070 --> 00:49:07,568
James Hunt finally takes his
first victory of the season

771
00:49:07,570 --> 00:49:10,409
here in Spain, after
a brilliant drive.

772
00:49:10,409 --> 00:49:12,969
It was only a matter of time.

773
00:49:29,329 --> 00:49:32,199
- It's too wide.
- Disqualified.

774
00:49:32,199 --> 00:49:34,668
- What?
- You're disqualified.

775
00:49:34,670 --> 00:49:36,568
How can we be disqualified?

776
00:49:36,570 --> 00:49:38,900
- 1.5 cm.
- It's the same car.

777
00:49:46,079 --> 00:49:49,510
...McLaren M23 has proved
very controversial here.

778
00:49:50,650 --> 00:49:53,048
Just make it narrower.
I don't care how.

779
00:49:53,050 --> 00:49:55,088
New rear suspension.
New wishbones.

780
00:49:55,090 --> 00:49:57,958
I wanna make sure this
thing is legal, no doubts.

781
00:49:57,960 --> 00:50:00,688
Then we'd better move the oil
coolers to the old position.

782
00:50:00,690 --> 00:50:03,228
- The wing brackets need...
- Fuck.

783

<i>And James Hunt is out!</i>

791
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:33,548
Can you tell us what happened?

792
00:50:33,550 --> 00:50:35,458
Sure. It's magic, we've
taken a great car,

793
00:50:35,460 --> 00:50:37,358
a great piece of engineering
and overnight turned it

794
00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:39,960
into a big, huge stinking turd.

795
00:50:40,699 --> 00:50:42,929
BELGIUM MAY 1976

796
00:50:52,139 --> 00:50:53,110
Shit!

797
00:50:57,050 --> 00:50:59,048
What the hell have you done?
The car's evil!

798
00:50:59,050 --> 00:51:00,748
It's fucking undriveable!

799
00:51:00,750 --> 00:51:03,318
If there's a problem with
the car, we'll fix it.

800
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:05,389
The car is a piece of shit.
You should be appealing this.

801
00:51:05,389 --> 00:51:07,228
- We are appealing.
- We'll son it out.

802
00:51:07,230 --> 00:51:09,688
- They're killing us out there.
- Go an get your dick wet.

803
00:51:09,690 --> 00:51:11,659
- You're a wanker!
- Fuck you!

804
00:51:11,659 --> 00:51:13,628
You're fucking wanker!

805
00:51:13,630 --> 00:51:15,728
But this was a good
race for you, no, Niki?

806
00:51:15,730 --> 00:51:17,139
It's good for everyone

807
00:51:17,139 --> 00:51:19,039
that the quickest car
happens to be a legal car.

808
00:51:19,039 --> 00:51:21,938
James, your 50 points behind
Lauda in the championship.

809
00:51:21,940 --> 00:51:23,708
You've had another
retirement today.

810
00:51:23,710 --> 00:51:25,239
What's going wrong?

811
00:51:25,239 --> 00:51:27,248
It's dirty politics
and dirty tricks,

812
00:51:27,250 --> 00:51:29,148
that's what's going wrong.

813
00:51:29,150 --> 00:51:31,378
<i>So as we approach
the halfway point</i>

814
00:51:31,380 --> 00:51:33,418
<i>in this year's Formula 1 season,</i>

815
00:51:33,420 --> 00:51:36,688
<i>Ferrari and Niki Lauda
seem clearly on top</i>

816
00:51:36,690 --> 00:51:40,028
<i>and James Hunt and
McLaren are struggling.</i>

817
00:51:40,030 --> 00:51:43,360
So, five races in,
how's it going so far?

818
00:51:43,699 --> 00:51:47,298
It's fine. Just got a little
problem with an Austrian rat

819
00:51:47,300 --> 00:51:50,369
and his team of Italian cheats
who've destroyed my car.

820
00:51:50,369 --> 00:51:53,509
- What are you talking about?
- About the race in Spain I won.

821
00:51:53,510 --> 00:51:55,369
Yeah, in a car which
is not legal.

822
00:51:55,369 --> 00:51:57,108
Five eighths of
an inch too wide.

823
00:51:57,110 --> 00:51:59,409
You know that doesn't have the
slightest effect on speed.

824
00:51:59,409 --> 00:52:01,108
But you complained and
your team of lawyers

825
00:52:01,110 --> 00:52:04,079
leaned on the authorities. Now
we've had to rebuild the car

826
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:06,688
- and it's become a monster.
- At least it's a legal monster.

827
00:52:06,690 --> 00:52:08,489
You've had to
resort to cheating.

828
00:52:08,489 --> 00:52:11,759
You're driving an illegal car and
call me a cheater? Pathetic.

829
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:15,429
- Rules are rules.
- Yes, and rats are rats.

830
00:52:15,429 --> 00:52:17,360
Thank you. Thank you.

831
00:52:19,630 --> 00:52:22,228
Do you really think
it upsets me, James,

832
00:52:22,230 --> 00:52:25,199
calling me a rat because
I look like one?

833
00:52:25,199 --> 00:52:26,570
I don't mind it.

834
00:52:27,110 --> 00:52:29,108
Rats are ugly, sure,
and nobody like them,

835
00:52:29,110 --> 00:52:30,579
but they're very intelligent

836
00:52:30,579 --> 00:52:32,938
and they have a strong
survival instinct.

837
00:52:32,940 --> 00:52:33,909
Wonderful.

838
00:52:36,380 --> 00:52:38,440
No wonder she left him.

839
00:52:55,429 --> 00:52:57,369
Anyone seen Suzy?

840
00:52:58,739 --> 00:53:01,239
She's supposed to be here today.

841
00:53:01,239 --> 00:53:04,730
We didn't wanna tell
you before the race.

842
00:53:05,210 --> 00:53:06,340
Tell me what?

Yeah.

So when did all this start?

852
00:53:51,619 --> 00:53:53,920
That weekend I went skiing.

853
00:53:56,730 --> 00:53:59,130
Why have you come here, James?

854
00:53:59,659 --> 00:54:01,630
I've got to get you back.

855
00:54:02,369 --> 00:54:04,498
You don't want me back.

856
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:06,338
You never wanted to be
married in the first place.

857
00:54:06,340 --> 00:54:09,009
- Yes, I did.
- Oh, come on, James.

858
00:54:09,010 --> 00:54:11,639
You did it because you
hoped it might change you,

859
00:54:11,639 --> 00:54:13,748
settle you down, help
with the racing.

860
00:54:13,750 --> 00:54:15,278
No, I didn't.

861
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:17,679
And who knows, if it had
been just the drinking,

862
00:54:17,679 --> 00:54:20,670
or the dope, or the
infidelity or the moods,

863
00:54:21,219 --> 00:54:23,219
it might even have worked.

864
00:54:23,219 --> 00:54:25,219
- But when it's all of them...
- Yes, I know, I'm terrible.

865
00:54:25,219 --> 00:54:27,210
No, you're not terrible.

866
00:54:27,929 --> 00:54:31,449
You're just who you are at
this point in your life.

867
00:54:33,260 --> 00:54:35,699
God help anyone who wants more.

868
00:54:37,670 --> 00:54:39,369
And Richard Burton,

869
00:54:39,369 --> 00:54:41,929
will he be able
to give you more?

870
00:54:42,309 --> 00:54:45,938
You know, he has quite the
bad boy reputation himself.

871
00:54:45,940 --> 00:54:48,679
What's important is
how it feels to me,

872
00:54:48,679 --> 00:54:51,670
and it feels like he adores me.

873
00:54:57,619 --> 00:54:58,590
James!

874
00:54:59,289 --> 00:55:01,728
Are you and Suzy
getting back together?

875
00:55:01,730 --> 00:55:03,998
It's all very amicable.

876
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,458
My wife has found
herself a new backer...

877
00:55:06,460 --> 00:55:09,228
I mean, lover, which
makes her happy.

878
00:55:09,230 --> 00:55:11,998
And Mr. Burton has found a
way of feeling young again,

879
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,199
which makes him happy.

880
00:55:13,199 --> 00:55:16,168
Let's hope his pockets are deep.
They'll need to be.

881
00:55:16,170 --> 00:55:18,639
And I found a way to be
single and have an ex-wife

882
00:55:18,639 --> 00:55:20,648
without it costing me a Penny,

883
00:55:20,650 --> 00:55:23,409
which has to go down as the
biggest win of my career.

884
00:55:23,949 --> 00:55:25,969
I have a flight to catch.

885

BRANDS HATCH SUNDAY
18TH JULY 1976

895
00:57:19,699 --> 00:57:21,998
<i>Hunt has really closed
the gap on Lauda</i>

896
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:23,969
<i>as they head into Druids.</i>

897
00:57:25,199 --> 00:57:28,208
<i>Niki Lauda is under real
pressure from James Hunt</i>

898
00:57:28,210 --> 00:57:30,869
<i>as they go up the hill

899
00:57:36,280 --> 00:57:38,880
<i>And Hunt is in front of Lauda!</i>

900
00:57:46,090 --> 00:57:48,389
<i>So James Hunt gets the
plaudits of the crowd,</i>

901
00:57:48,389 --> 00:57:50,958
<i>the first Briton to win
a British Grand Prix</i>

902
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:54,420
<i>at Brands Hatch since
Jim Clark in 1964.</i>

903
00:57:56,969 --> 00:57:59,938
James, at the moment you've got
a terrific edge over the rest,

904
00:57:59,940 --> 00:58:02,208
<i>how have you achieved
this advantage?</i>

905
00:58:02,210 --> 00:58:03,369
Big balls.

906
00:58:05,309 --> 00:58:08,248
<i>Following an inquiry into
the disqualification</i>

907
00:58:08,250 --> 00:58:11,219
<i>of driver James Hunt from
the Spanish Grand Prix,</i>

908
00:58:11,219 --> 00:58:14,489
<i>it has been decided to
overturn this disqualification</i>

909
00:58:14,489 --> 00:58:18,050
<i>and to restore his victory
and reinstate his points.</i>

910
00:58:24,030 --> 00:58:25,159
James!

911
00:58:25,159 --> 00:58:28,128
A few weeks ago you were out
of the running completely

912
00:58:28,130 --> 00:58:30,998
and now you're right back in it.
What's changed?

913
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:32,938
It's a combination of factors,

914
00:58:32,940 --> 00:58:35,438
not all of which I'm
prepared to discuss here.

915
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:38,539
But justice being done re the
disqualification in Spain

916
00:58:38,539 --> 00:58:41,599
helps and having my car
back at its best again.

917
00:58:44,420 --> 00:58:46,210
Are you worried?

918
01:01:29,949 --> 01:01:32,518
<i>Welcome to the
legendary Nüburgring.</i>

919
01:01:32,519 --> 01:01:35,219
<i>This is a 14.2 mile track,</i>

920
01:01:35,219 --> 01:01:38,659
<i>complete with 185
corners and bends.</i>

921
01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:39,318
<i>Welcome to the Nüburgring,</i>

922
01:02:39,320 --> 01:02:42,188
<i>the most dangerous circuit
on the season calendar.</i>

923
01:02:42,190 --> 01:02:43,748
<i>In Formula 1 it is known</i>

924
01:02:43,750 --> 01:02:45,289
<i>as "The Graveyard."</i>

925
01:02:45,289 --> 01:02:47,159
<i>The weather conditions
are far from ideal</i>

926
01:02:47,159 --> 01:02:50,619
<i>and latest reports indicate
there is no relief in sight.</i>

927
01:02:54,969 --> 01:02:56,019
Gentlemen.

928
01:02:57,230 --> 01:03:00,039
Well, gentlemen,
please be quiet.

929
01:03:00,039 --> 01:03:01,338
Thank you.

930
01:03:01,340 --> 01:03:03,199
- Niki Lauda.
- Thank you.

931
01:03:04,710 --> 01:03:08,148
I called this meeting because,
as all you drivers know,

932
01:03:08,150 --> 01:03:10,679
the Nüburgring is the most
stupid, barbaric, outdated

933
01:03:10,679 --> 01:03:12,478
and dangerous track
in the world.

934
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:14,648
You've all seen the rain
that has been falling today.

935
01:03:14,650 --> 01:03:16,688
Those of you with
experience know the ring

936
01:03:16,690 --> 01:03:19,559
needs perfect conditions to
be even remotely acceptable

937
01:03:19,559 --> 01:03:21,159
in terms of risk.

938
01:03:21,159 --> 01:03:23,458
And today, with the rain,
it's anything but perfect,

939
01:03:23,460 --> 01:03:26,498
so I called this meeting to
take vote to cancel the race.

940
01:03:26,500 --> 01:03:28,190
Cancel the race?

941
01:03:28,670 --> 01:03:31,239
There would be no
change to the situation

942
01:03:31,239 --> 01:03:32,568
as far as points is concerned.

943
01:03:32,570 --> 01:03:34,168
The race would
simply be cancelled.

944
01:03:34,170 --> 01:03:35,239
This is bullshit!

945
01:03:35,239 --> 01:03:37,378
If the race is cancelled,
none of us get our race fees.

946
01:03:37,380 --> 01:03:39,708
That's true, you leave
without your fee,

947
01:03:39,710 --> 01:03:41,978
but you might leave
with your life.

948
01:03:41,980 --> 01:03:44,119
It also means that you
would effectively win

949
01:03:44,119 --> 01:03:45,949
the championship.

950
01:03:46,320 --> 01:03:49,148
So I can see why this
suits you just fine.

951
01:03:49,150 --> 01:03:50,219
Why?

952
01:03:50,219 --> 01:03:52,119
There won't be no
points for me either.

953
01:03:52,119 --> 01:03:55,659
No, but there'd be one race less
where I, or anyone else here,

954
01:03:55,659 --> 01:03:57,958
- could catch you.
- James is right.

955
01:03:57,960 --> 01:04:00,028
This is just tactics!

956
01:04:00,030 --> 01:04:02,630
Maybe he's just frightened.

957
01:04:03,300 --> 01:04:05,500
Which asshole said this?

958
01:04:10,610 --> 01:04:12,978
Yes, of course, I'm frightened,

959
01:04:12,980 --> 01:04:14,409
and so are you.

960
01:04:16,010 --> 01:04:18,048
I accept every time
I get in my car

961
01:04:18,050 --> 01:04:21,289
there's 20% chance I could
die, and I can live with it,

962
01:04:21,289 --> 01:04:23,389
but not one percent more.

963
01:04:23,389 --> 01:04:26,159
And today, with the
rain, the risk is more.

964
01:04:26,159 --> 01:04:29,259
I suppose that all depends on
how good you are in the rain.

965
01:04:29,260 --> 01:04:31,199
I have the track record here.

966
01:04:31,199 --> 01:04:34,128
I'm the only person in history
to do the ring in under 7 Min.,

967
01:04:34,130 --> 01:04:37,659
so, actually, it's to my
advantage to race here today.

968
01:04:38,170 --> 01:04:40,599
Because I'm quicker
than all of you.

969
01:04:42,139 --> 01:04:45,338
- Come on.
- Fine. Then let's race.

970
01:04:45,340 --> 01:04:46,329
Yeah!

971
01:04:47,110 --> 01:04:49,409
- Niki, let's race.
- Gentlemen, please.

972
01:04:49,409 --> 01:04:51,679
Why are we here, Niki? Come on.

973
01:04:56,150 --> 01:04:59,650
Well, all those in favor
of cancelling the race.

974
01:05:09,730 --> 01:05:12,260
All those in favor of racing.

975
01:05:18,210 --> 01:05:20,300
Gentlemen, the race is on.

976
01:05:26,449 --> 01:05:29,349
- Ridiculous.
- What a waste of time.

977
01:05:29,989 --> 01:05:31,719
You know, Niki,
every now and then

978
01:05:31,719 --> 01:05:34,210
it helps if people like you.

979
01:05:49,309 --> 01:05:51,679
<i>In places the track is
still dangerously wet,</i>

980
01:05:51,679 --> 01:05:54,340
<i>but following a drivers meeting,
a decision has been taken.</i>

981
01:06:02,619 --> 01:06:04,489
<i>One minute to go.</i>

982
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:17,199
Jochen's going on slicks.
You wanna change?

983
01:06:17,639 --> 01:06:19,998
- Is Niki gonna change?
- No.

984
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,340
Then we stay on wets too.

985
01:06:29,710 --> 01:06:32,440
- Niki, okay?
- I'm good.

986
01:06:33,650 --> 01:06:35,880
All right, fire her up.

987
01:06:50,070 --> 01:06:53,268
<i>This season's fight for
the F1 World Championship</i>

988
01:06:53,269 --> 01:06:56,309
<i>has so far been the
story of two men.</i>

989
01:06:56,309 --> 01:07:00,139
<i>Thus far it's been going pretty
much the way of Niki Lauda.</i>

990
01:07:00,139 --> 01:07:02,708
<i>But James Hunt has
qualified fastest here.</i>

991
01:07:02,710 --> 01:07:05,349
<i>He is on pole position for
the German Grand Prix</i>

992
01:07:05,349 --> 01:07:08,610
<i>with Niki Lauda alongside
in the blood-red Ferrari.</i>

993
01:07:10,650 --> 01:07:12,188
<i>It's a long race.</i>

994
01:07:12,190 --> 01:07:14,188
<i>If the track starts to dry out,</i>

995
01:07:14,190 --> 01:07:17,719
<i>the wet-weather tyres will
no longer be as quick.</i>

996
01:07:38,250 --> 01:07:40,119
<i>Niki Lauda and James Hunt,</i>

997
01:07:40,119 --> 01:07:42,219
<i>side by side on the
front of the grid,</i>

998
01:07:42,219 --> 01:07:44,619
<i>go away absolutely as one!</i>

999
01:07:58,670 --> 01:08:00,739
<i>Lauda very aggressive
on Hunt there,</i>

1000
01:08:00,739 --> 01:08:03,369
<i>forcing the McLaren
onto the grass.</i>

1001
01:08:07,139 --> 01:08:10,748
<i>Lauda has the lead right now!
He leads into the first corner!</i>

1002
01:08:10,750 --> 01:08:12,940
<i>Hunt is in second place!</i>

1003
01:08:17,720 --> 01:08:20,088
<i>Mass storming past Hunt!</i>

1004
01:08:20,090 --> 01:08:23,550
<i>He made the right choice to go
with the dry-weather tyres.</i>

1005
01:08:24,329 --> 01:08:26,429
<i>Mass passing Lauda now!</i>

1006
01:08:26,430 --> 01:08:30,469
<i>Jochen Mass, in the number
12 McLaren, takes the lead!</i>

1007
01:08:30,470 --> 01:08:33,198
<i>Jochen Mass, the clear
leader, with everybody else</i>

1008
01:08:33,199 --> 01:08:35,368
<i>making the decision
to change tyres</i>

1009
01:08:35,369 --> 01:08:37,109
<i>after just one lap of this race.</i>

1010
01:08:37,109 --> 01:08:38,970
Come on, let's go!

1011
01:08:47,119 --> 01:08:51,088
See? I told you to go on slicks.
You should've taken my advice.

1012
01:08:51,090 --> 01:08:53,319
Fuck off. Where's Niki?

1013
01:08:53,319 --> 01:08:56,449
Behind you. He made
the same mistake.

1014
01:09:08,310 --> 01:09:09,289
Come on!

1015
01:09:12,739 --> 01:09:15,369
Come on! What's going on?

1016
01:09:15,680 --> 01:09:19,479
<i>The tyre-changing frenzy caused
a huge reshuffling of the pack,</i>

1017
01:09:19,479 --> 01:09:22,319
<i>- with Mass in the lead now.
- You're clear. Go!</i>

1018
01:09:25,159 --> 01:09:27,350
Lauda urging his
mechanics to hurry.

1019
01:09:30,189 --> 01:09:32,960
It's a disaster! Come on!

1020
01:09:43,909 --> 01:09:45,569
What's going on, you assholes?

1021
01:10:09,029 --> 01:10:11,698
<i>This race has gone
wrong for him so far.</i>

1022
01:10:11,699 --> 01:10:13,639
<i>His championship
rival, James Hunt,</i>

1023
01:10:13,640 --> 01:10:15,659
<i>is a long way up the road.</i>

1024
01:10:26,020 --> 01:10:28,349
<i>Lauda passing car after car.
He's just going past.</i>

1025
01:10:28,350 --> 01:10:30,619
<i>Mario Andretti's Lotus there.</i>

1026
01:11:17,569 --> 01:11:18,539
Niki!

1027
01:11:24,340 --> 01:11:25,670
Get me out!

1028
01:11:25,939 --> 01:11:26,909
Help me!

1029
01:11:29,609 --> 01:11:31,519
<i>Several cars are involved.</i>

1030
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:33,920
<i>Looks like it might be
one of the Ferraris.</i>

1031
01:11:41,060 --> 01:11:43,390
- Come this way!
- Come on, come on!

1032
01:11:55,670 --> 01:11:57,069
Keep trying

1033
01:12:04,250 --> 01:12:06,380
- Come this way.
- Okay.

1034
01:13:44,350 --> 01:13:47,219
<i>The flood, which swept down Big
Thompson Canyon in Colorado,</i>

1035
01:13:47,220 --> 01:13:49,649
<i>was the worst since
records began.</i>

1036
01:13:49,649 --> 01:13:52,418
<i>In Formula 1 today, victory
celebrations were muted</i>

1037
01:13:52,420 --> 01:13:54,628
<i>after a horrific accident
involving world champion.</i>

1038
01:13:54,630 --> 01:13:56,328
<i>Niki Lauda.</i>

1039
01:13:56,329 --> 01:13:58,359
<i>Due to safety concerns
before the race,</i>

1040
01:13:58,359 --> 01:14:00,658
<i>the Austrian had said
he would not take pan,</i>

1041
01:14:00,659 --> 01:14:02,630
<i>but in the end he did.</i>

1042
01:14:03,430 --> 01:14:06,038
<i>He was making up for lost time
when he went off the track,</i>

1043
01:14:06,039 --> 01:14:08,368
<i>puncturing the
Ferrari's fuel tank.</i>

1044
01:14:08,369 --> 01:14:11,338
<i>Brett Lunger was unable to
avoid the flaming wreck</i>

1045
01:14:11,340 --> 01:14:14,279
<i>but was unhurt and joined other
drivers to rescue Lauda,</i>

1046
01:14:14,279 --> 01:14:17,309
<i>who was taken to Manheim
Hospital with severe burns,</i>

1047
01:14:17,310 --> 01:14:20,948
<i>the incident reminding us again
of the dangers of Formula 1.</i>

1048
01:14:20,949 --> 01:14:23,048
<i>Niki Lauda was trapped
for almost a minute</i>

1049
01:14:23,050 --> 01:14:26,109
<i>in a searing inferno
of 800-plus degrees.</i>

1050
01:16:10,229 --> 01:16:15,159
<i>James Hunt gains on the
absent Niki Lauda.</i>

1051
01:16:18,369 --> 01:16:21,270
28th DAY IN HOSPITAL
29th August 1976.

1052
01:19:12,380 --> 01:19:14,738
- Morning, chaps.
- Hey, here's the man.

1053
01:19:14,739 --> 01:19:16,079
Looking good.

1054
01:19:19,649 --> 01:19:22,219
- What's going on?
- Jesus. It's Niki.

1055
01:19:22,220 --> 01:19:24,418
- What about him?
- He's here.

1056
01:19:24,420 --> 01:19:26,340
- What?
- He's racing.

1057
01:19:41,539 --> 01:19:42,510
Niki.

1058
01:19:49,579 --> 01:19:51,210
It's that bad, huh?

1059
01:19:52,279 --> 01:19:53,250
No.

1060
01:19:54,579 --> 01:19:58,118
In hospital, I asked them
straight, no bullshit,

1061
01:19:58,119 --> 01:20:00,958
how bad my appearance would be.

1062
01:20:00,960 --> 01:20:03,958
They said with time
it would be fine.

1063
01:20:03,960 --> 01:20:05,289
But it won't.

1064
01:20:06,399 --> 01:20:09,420
I can tell, seeing
your reaction.

1065
01:20:10,329 --> 01:20:12,198
I'll spend the rest of my life

1066
01:20:12,199 --> 01:20:15,039
with a face that
frightens people.

1067
01:20:17,369 --> 01:20:20,738
You know, Niki, I tried to write
you a letter at the time,

1068
01:20:20,739 --> 01:20:22,229
to apologise.

1069
01:20:22,979 --> 01:20:25,649
The drivers' meeting in
Germany, before the race.

1070
01:20:25,649 --> 01:20:28,519
- I swayed the room.
- Yes, you did.

1071
01:20:28,520 --> 01:20:31,288
That race should never
have gone ahead.

1072
01:20:31,289 --> 01:20:33,079
No, it shouldn't.

1073
01:20:33,189 --> 01:20:37,088
So in many ways I feel
responsible for what happened...

1074
01:20:37,090 --> 01:20:38,359
You were.

1075
01:20:40,159 --> 01:20:41,390
But, trust me,

1076
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:45,238
watching you win those races,

1077
01:20:45,239 --> 01:20:47,729
while I was fighting
for my life...

1078
01:20:49,310 --> 01:20:52,970
you were equally responsible for
getting me back in the car.

1079
01:21:20,340 --> 01:21:22,960
- How are you feeling, Niki?
- Fine.

1080
01:21:23,470 --> 01:21:24,469
Niki,

1081
01:21:24,470 --> 01:21:28,038
can you confirm to us exactly
which procedures you had

1082
01:21:28,039 --> 01:21:30,048
and the expectations
for you recovery?

1083
01:21:30,050 --> 01:21:31,039
Sure.

1084
01:21:31,350 --> 01:21:33,349
I had a skin graft operation

1085
01:21:33,350 --> 01:21:36,250
where they put half my
right thigh in my face.

1086
01:21:37,659 --> 01:21:39,850
Now, it doesn't look too good,

1087
01:21:40,159 --> 01:21:42,429
but one unexpected advantage is

1088
01:21:42,430 --> 01:21:44,588
it's impossible to perspire
through a skin graft,

1089
01:21:44,590 --> 01:21:46,998
so sweat will never run
into my eyes again,

1090
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:49,359
which is good for a driver.

1091
01:21:50,430 --> 01:21:52,469
When they heard about
your condition,

1092
01:21:52,470 --> 01:21:55,109
Ferrari immediately hired
a replacement driver,

1093
01:21:55,109 --> 01:21:56,408
Carlos Reutemann.

1094
01:21:56,409 --> 01:21:59,970
Yeah, before ever
reaching the hospital.

1095
01:22:00,439 --> 01:22:03,710
- Is Reutemann driving today too?
- Yes.

1096
01:22:04,180 --> 01:22:06,248
And keen to make an impression.

1097
01:22:06,250 --> 01:22:08,248
So let's see where
Mr. Reutemann finishes

1098
01:22:08,250 --> 01:22:10,579
and where I finish today.

1099
01:22:11,220 --> 01:22:13,219
James Hunt and McLaren
have caught up a lot

1100
01:22:13,220 --> 01:22:15,189
while you were away.

1101
01:22:15,189 --> 01:22:16,159
Yes.

1102
01:22:16,729 --> 01:22:16,890
So is there a question now.

1103
01:22:16,890 --> 01:22:18,529
So is there a question now

1104
01:22:18,529 --> 01:22:21,460
or are you just trying
to piss me off?

1105
01:22:23,100 --> 01:22:25,498
You still think you can win?

1106
01:22:25,500 --> 01:22:27,198
Yes, of course.

1107
01:22:27,199 --> 01:22:28,689
I have the better car.

1108
01:22:29,239 --> 01:22:32,038
And possibly I'm
the better driver.

1109
01:22:32,039 --> 01:22:34,609
But he's a clever guy and
he's used his time well

1110
01:22:34,609 --> 01:22:36,109
while I was lying
half-dead in hospital

1111
01:22:36,109 --> 01:22:37,279
while I was lying
half-dead in hospital

1112
01:22:37,279 --> 01:22:39,109
to win some points.

1113
01:22:40,350 --> 01:22:43,909
And what did your wife say
when she saw your face?

1114
01:22:49,229 --> 01:22:51,020
She said, "Sweetie",

1115
01:22:51,359 --> 01:22:54,420
you don't need a face to drive.
You just need the right foot."

1116
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:57,399
I'm being serious.

1117
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,738
Do you really think your
marriage can survive

1118
01:23:00,739 --> 01:23:03,229
with the way you look now?

1119
01:23:05,069 --> 01:23:07,130
And I'm being serious too.

1120
01:23:07,779 --> 01:23:09,010
Fuck you.

1121
01:23:09,649 --> 01:23:11,579
Press conference over.

1122
01:23:16,350 --> 01:23:19,618
- That was hairy.
- You know how to get noticed.

1123
01:23:19,619 --> 01:23:21,418
I thought it went
well, to be honest.

1124
01:23:21,420 --> 01:23:23,389
They don't like it when
it's not going their way.

1125
01:23:23,390 --> 01:23:25,029
That's the game.

1126
01:23:25,029 --> 01:23:27,158
- See you.
- See you later.

1127
01:23:27,159 --> 01:23:29,368
- James, are you all right?
- Good, yeah.

1128
01:23:29,369 --> 01:23:32,069
I think I've got something for
you on that last question,

1129
01:23:32,069 --> 01:23:33,368
- about Niki.
- You heard about that?

1130
01:23:33,369 --> 01:23:34,810
- About Niki.
- You heard about that?

1131
01:23:36,270 --> 01:23:37,239
James?

1132
01:23:45,680 --> 01:23:47,409
Please, James...

1133
01:23:47,680 --> 01:23:51,350
Now go home to your wife
and ask her how you look.

1134
01:23:53,760 --> 01:23:54,720
Prick.

1135
01:24:11,539 --> 01:24:14,078
<i>So Niki Lauda, just 42 days</i>

1136
01:24:14,079 --> 01:24:16,679
<i>after his near-fatal
accident at Nüburgring,</i>

1137
01:24:16,680 --> 01:24:18,349
<i>will race here today, at Monza</i>

1138
01:24:18,350 --> 01:24:22,180
<i>against all medical advice and
no doubt in incredible pain.</i>

1139
01:24:26,920 --> 01:24:30,229
<i>Photographers, please,
clear the grid.</i>

1140
01:25:07,630 --> 01:25:09,850
Niki, it's time.

1141
01:25:11,270 --> 01:25:12,520
Okay?

1142
01:25:19,380 --> 01:25:21,310
<i>Please, clear the grid.</i>

1143
01:25:23,479 --> 01:25:25,449
<i>One minute to go.</i>

1144
01:26:11,659 --> 01:26:14,599
<i>The returning Niki Lauda
seems overwhelmed.</i>

1145
01:26:14,600 --> 01:26:17,460
<i>He's been overtaken
by car after car.</i>

1146
01:26:26,609 --> 01:26:29,909
<i>Lauda's off line. He runs
wide onto the grass.</i>

1147
01:26:34,920 --> 01:26:36,988
<i>He wrestles it back
onto the track,</i>

1148
01:26:36,989 --> 01:26:39,279
<i>but that was a bad
moment for Niki.</i>

1149
01:26:43,250 --> 01:26:45,698
<i>Niki Lauda's the
reigning world champion,</i>

1150
01:26:45,699 --> 01:26:48,929
<i>but maybe in his current state
he's a danger out there,</i>

1151
01:26:48,930 --> 01:26:51,989
<i>to himself and to the
rest of the field.</i>

1152
01:26:53,470 --> 01:26:57,569
<i>And Stuck has collided with
Mario Andretti's Lotus!</i>

1153
01:26:57,569 --> 01:27:00,539
<i>Niki's boxed in! He's
got nowhere to go!</i>

1154
01:27:15,289 --> 01:27:17,488
<i>Niki Lauda's actually
making a move.</i>

1155
01:27:17,489 --> 01:27:19,619
<i>He's on Brambilla's tail.</i>

1156
01:27:22,130 --> 01:27:25,269
<i>He pulls out of the
slipstream to overtake.</i>

1157
01:27:25,270 --> 01:27:27,469
<i>Lauda's starting
to find the form</i>

1158
01:27:27,470 --> 01:27:30,300
<i>that early in this race
we believed he'd lost.</i>

1159
01:27:36,350 --> 01:27:39,048
<i>Lauda's now lapping
faster than Reutemann</i>

1160
01:27:39,050 --> 01:27:41,760
<i>and closing the gap ahead.</i>

1161
01:27:44,319 --> 01:27:46,689
<i>Lauda closing on
Carlos Reutemann,</i>

1162
01:27:46,689 --> 01:27:49,059
<i>the man called in to
be his replacement</i>

1163
01:27:49,060 --> 01:27:50,619
<i>in the Ferrari team.</i>

1164
01:27:59,180 --> 01:28:01,338
<i>And there's James
Hunt's McLaren,</i>

1165
01:28:01,340 --> 01:28:04,640
<i>smoking stationary by
the side of the road.</i>

1166
01:28:07,039 --> 01:28:10,340
<i>This is bad news for
Hunt's championship hopes.</i>

1167
01:28:15,020 --> 01:28:16,488
<i>It's Ronnie Peterson</i>

1168
01:28:16,489 --> 01:28:18,868
<i>who comes home the
winner here at Monza.</i>

1169
01:28:18,869 --> 01:28:22,050
<i>But all eyes are on the man who
finishes a brilliant fourth!</i>

1170
01:28:22,560 --> 01:28:24,029
<i>Niki Lauda!</i>

1171
01:29:05,500 --> 01:29:08,038
<i>What a race, what a
man, what a season.</i>

1172
01:29:08,039 --> 01:29:10,208
<i>With a 4th-place finish and
three priceless points,</i>

1173
01:29:10,210 --> 01:29:12,309
<i>Niki Lauda is a
major step closer</i>

1174
01:29:12,310 --> 01:29:15,109
<i>to retaining the
World Championship.</i>

1175
01:30:12,739 --> 01:30:16,509
<i>So the long, grueling and
incredibly dramatic season</i>

1176
01:30:16,510 --> 01:30:19,439
<i>comes down to this
final race in Japan,</i>

1177
01:30:19,439 --> 01:30:21,970
<i>in the shadow of Mount Fuji.</i>

1178
01:30:22,279 --> 01:30:25,408
<i>Niki Lauda goes into this
deciding race at Fuji</i>

1179
01:30:25,409 --> 01:30:27,719
<i>just three points
ahead of James Hunt,</i>

1180
01:30:27,720 --> 01:30:30,719
<i>Hunt knowing he must beat the
Austrian fair and square</i>

1181
01:30:30,720 --> 01:30:32,770
<i>to take the title.</i>

1182
01:30:33,460 --> 01:30:37,059
James, do you think you can
cope with the pressure?

1183
01:30:37,060 --> 01:30:39,429
Well, I've never really
understood what that means.

1184
01:30:39,430 --> 01:30:42,560
I love my job. I love competing.
I love racing.

1185
01:30:43,529 --> 01:30:45,769
Maybe you should ask Niki.
He's the World Champion.

1186
01:30:45,770 --> 01:30:47,399
He's got everything to lose.

1187
01:30:47,399 --> 01:30:49,708
Mr. Lauda, are you
feeling pressure?

1188
01:30:49,710 --> 01:30:52,010
Do I look like I'm
feeling pressure?

1189
01:30:54,079 --> 01:30:55,479
I'm World Champion

1190
01:30:55,479 --> 01:30:58,548
and on the verge to become
World Champion again.

1191
01:30:58,550 --> 01:31:00,979
Hunt now has the
opportunity to win,

1192
01:31:00,979 --> 01:31:02,748
but it's not so easy
to become a champion.

1193
01:31:02,750 --> 01:31:05,479
You have to really believe
it to make it possible.

1194
01:31:05,789 --> 01:31:08,219
James, is there anything
you'd like to add?

1195
01:31:08,220 --> 01:31:10,618
If Niki is being tricky
and getting a kicky

1196
01:31:10,619 --> 01:31:13,010
out of playing mind games,

1197
01:31:13,060 --> 01:31:14,729
then fine, I'm flattered.

1198
01:31:14,729 --> 01:31:18,130
The fact is momentum is with me.
I've never felt better.

1199
01:31:18,500 --> 01:31:20,969
I fully expect the next press
conference we will have

1200
01:31:20,970 --> 01:31:22,600
will be with me as
World Champion.

1201
01:31:27,210 --> 01:31:29,708
<i>Intermittent heavy
rain has been forecast</i>

1202
01:31:29,710 --> 01:31:32,618
<i>here at Fuji today,
along with strong winds</i>

1203
01:31:32,619 --> 01:31:34,179
<i>and occasional fog</i>

1204
01:31:34,180 --> 01:31:36,449
<i>rolling in from the mountain.</i>

1205
01:31:38,220 --> 01:31:40,719
<i>And so with today's Japanese
Grand Prix to come,</i>

1206
01:31:40,720 --> 01:31:43,189
<i>Lauda's lead a
mere three points.</i>

1207
01:31:43,189 --> 01:31:45,059
<i>What a way to finish the season.</i>

1208
01:31:45,060 --> 01:31:46,458
<i>Hunt or Lauda?</i>

1209
01:31:46,460 --> 01:31:50,038
<i>The final chapter will unfold when
we bring you extended coverage...</i>

1210
01:31:50,039 --> 01:31:51,399
They've got to cancel the race.

1211
01:31:51,399 --> 01:31:52,769
It's lethal out there.

1212
01:31:52,770 --> 01:31:54,668
The race is going ahead.

1213
01:31:54,670 --> 01:31:57,168
Television rights have been
sold all around the world.

1214
01:31:57,170 --> 01:31:58,538
The showdown between
you and Niki

1215
01:31:58,539 --> 01:32:00,139
is all anyone wants to see.

1216
01:32:00,140 --> 01:32:03,248
<i>With heavy rain continuing
to fall here at Fuji,</i>

1217
01:32:03,250 --> 01:32:05,509
<i>a decision has
finally been made.</i>

1218
01:32:05,510 --> 01:32:09,359
<i>The 1976 Japanese Grand
Prix will go ahead.</i>

1219
01:32:10,090 --> 01:32:12,680
<i>All drivers to
your cars, please.</i>

1220
01:32:37,109 --> 01:32:39,050
<i>Five minutes to go.</i>

1221
01:33:21,420 --> 01:33:23,158
- All right?
- All right.

1222
01:33:23,159 --> 01:33:25,559
- Hold still.
- What the hell are you doing?

1223
01:33:25,560 --> 01:33:27,229
To let the condensation out.

1224
01:33:27,229 --> 01:33:30,099
- It'll also let the water in.
- Not if you're leading.

1225
01:33:30,100 --> 01:33:33,329
Trust me, this race is
all about the start.

1226
01:33:33,970 --> 01:33:36,600
- Need a hand here?
- Yeah, hold it, Teddy.

1227
01:33:51,319 --> 01:33:53,449
Okay, start the bastard.

1228
01:33:55,659 --> 01:33:57,220
Good luck, kid.

1229
01:33:59,500 --> 01:34:01,119
Good luck, James!

1230
01:34:39,439 --> 01:34:41,399
30 seconds to go.

1231
01:35:01,319 --> 01:35:03,529
<i>Electric tension here at Fuji.</i>

1232
01:35:03,529 --> 01:35:05,998
<i>80,000 bedraggled race fans</i>

1233
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:09,128
<i>and the racing grudge
match of the decade.</i>

1234
01:35:09,130 --> 01:35:11,368
<i>And there's Mario Andretti
in pole position,</i>

1235
01:35:11,369 --> 01:35:13,430
<i>James Hunt alongside him.</i>

1236
01:35:14,600 --> 01:35:16,738
<i>On row two of the grid,</i>

1237
01:35:16,739 --> 01:35:18,309
<i>there is Niki Lauda,</i>

1238
01:35:18,310 --> 01:35:21,139
<i>and on row three of the grid, Joe
Schecketer from South Africa</i>

1239
01:35:21,140 --> 01:35:22,609
<i>in the six-wheel Tyrrell.</i>

1240
01:35:22,609 --> 01:35:25,640
<i>Behind him, the rest
of the 25-car field.</i>

1241
01:35:42,630 --> 01:35:45,328
<i>There's the flag and finally
the Japanese Grand Prix</i>

1242
01:35:45,329 --> 01:35:47,000
<i>is underway!</i>

1243
01:35:59,350 --> 01:36:01,948
<i>In this conditions it
must be almost impossible</i>

1244
01:36:01,949 --> 01:36:04,649
<i>to drive a 450-horsepower car!</i>

1245
01:36:31,550 --> 01:36:33,719
<i>And it's Andretti
who has the lead,</i>

1246
01:36:33,720 --> 01:36:35,149
<i>but Hunt is attacking.</i>

1247
01:36:35,149 --> 01:36:37,389
<i>Hunt's going round the
outside of Andretti!</i>

1248
01:36:37,390 --> 01:36:39,248
<i>Niki Lauda following
him through!</i>

1249
01:36:39,250 --> 01:36:42,220
<i>Hunt leads into the
first right-hander!</i>

1250
01:37:24,899 --> 01:37:28,069
<i>Hunt comes through to complete
his first lap leading the field.</i>

1251
01:37:28,069 --> 01:37:30,238
<i>At least he has clear
vision in front of him.</i>

1252
01:37:30,239 --> 01:37:33,170
<i>Niki Lauda behind him,
eating his spray.</i>

1253
01:37:52,289 --> 01:37:53,698
<i>Lauda is slowing!</i>

1254
01:37:53,699 --> 01:37:57,560
<i>Niki Lauda is bringing the Ferrari no.
1 into the pit!</i>

1255
01:37:58,229 --> 01:38:01,038
<i>Some sort of problem,
we can't imagine what,</i>

1256
01:38:01,039 --> 01:38:03,000
<i>so early in the race.</i>

1257
01:38:07,710 --> 01:38:09,140
What's wrong with the car?

1258
01:38:09,750 --> 01:38:11,649
What's wrong with the car?

1259
01:38:12,279 --> 01:38:14,418
Niki! What's wrong with the car?

1260
01:38:14,420 --> 01:38:16,649
Nothing. Car's perfect.

1261
01:38:20,989 --> 01:38:22,519
What are you doing?

1262
01:38:22,520 --> 01:38:23,628
I'm stopping

1263
01:38:23,630 --> 01:38:25,689
<i>His mechanics are asking
what the problem is.</i>

1264
01:38:25,689 --> 01:38:28,259
<i>But wait! Niki Lauda's
getting out of the car!</i>

1265
01:38:28,260 --> 01:38:30,029
<i>This is sensational!</i>

1266
01:38:30,029 --> 01:38:32,198
<i>The reigning World
Champion, Niki Lauda,</i>

1267
01:38:32,199 --> 01:38:33,969
<i>is out of this race.</i>

1268
01:38:33,970 --> 01:38:35,439
It's too dangerous.

1269
01:38:35,640 --> 01:38:37,338
Niki, you want me to say

1270
01:38:37,340 --> 01:38:39,908
there was a problem with
the car, for the media?

1271
01:38:39,909 --> 01:38:40,880
No.

1272
01:38:42,010 --> 01:38:43,439
Tell them the truth.

1273
01:38:44,109 --> 01:38:46,009
<i>Now, what is happening?</i>

1274
01:38:46,010 --> 01:38:47,979
<i>They're talking to
the team manager.</i>

1275
01:38:47,979 --> 01:38:50,420
<i>Lauda explaining something.</i>

1276
01:39:05,100 --> 01:39:08,269
<i>With Lauda out, James Hunt
knows he has to finish</i>

1277
01:39:08,270 --> 01:39:12,309
<i>this race in third place or
higher to be World Champion.</i>

1278
01:39:12,310 --> 01:39:15,279
<i>But the job's not done
yet for James Hunt.</i>

1279
01:39:15,279 --> 01:39:17,078
<i>In these dreadful conditions,</i>

1280
01:39:17,079 --> 01:39:19,600
<i>he still has to go the distance.</i>

1281
01:39:20,920 --> 01:39:23,149
<i>Fifteen laps to go here at Fuji.</i>

1282
01:39:23,149 --> 01:39:25,189
<i>James Hunt or Niki Lauda?</i>

1283
01:39:25,189 --> 01:39:28,259
<i>This extraordinary
season is not over yet.</i>

1284
01:39:28,260 --> 01:39:31,590
<i>In this treacherous final
round, can James Hunt hang on?</i>

1285
01:39:32,329 --> 01:39:35,559
<i>And the scoreboard tells a story.
Lap 58.</i>

1286
01:39:35,560 --> 01:39:37,359
<i>Hunt in the lead.</i>

1287
01:39:38,670 --> 01:39:41,260
Oh, God, his tyres,
they're blistering.

1288
01:39:42,170 --> 01:39:46,109
<i>Brambilla very close behind him,
closing on him all the time.</i>

1289
01:39:46,109 --> 01:39:49,439
<i>And he's trying to drive
inside James Hunt.</i>

1290
01:39:49,439 --> 01:39:52,408
<i>Hunt cuts across the
orange March nose.</i>

1291
01:39:52,409 --> 01:39:54,448
<i>Hunt not having that at all.
And he's spinning.</i>

1292
01:39:54,449 --> 01:39:58,219
<i>He missed Hunt but almost took
James Hunt out of the race</i>

1293
01:39:58,220 --> 01:40:00,259
<i>and out of the world
championship.</i>

1294
01:40:00,260 --> 01:40:03,619
<i>Now we find Mario Andretti
closing on James Hunt.</i>

1295
01:40:08,060 --> 01:40:10,229
<i>Mario Andretti's
going past Hunt!</i>

1296
01:40:10,229 --> 01:40:13,359
<i>Hunt is slowing. James Hunt
seems to have a problem.</i>

1297
01:40:18,609 --> 01:40:20,378
<i>Despite this wet conditions,</i>

1298
01:40:20,380 --> 01:40:22,868
<i>these wet-weather tyres
wear extremely fast.</i>

1299
01:40:22,869 --> 01:40:25,029
Hunt's tyres, they're gone.

1300
01:40:25,029 --> 01:40:28,409
<i>Hunt nursing his car
back to the pit stop.</i>

1301
01:40:30,390 --> 01:40:33,359
<i>That back marker's
going past Hunt.</i>

1302
01:40:33,359 --> 01:40:35,720
LAP 70 4 LAPS TO GO

1303
01:40:44,529 --> 01:40:47,998
<i>Look at that left front tyre,
right front tyre, sorry.</i>

1304
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:51,269
<i>No tread on it at all. And
the other one is flat.</i>

1305
01:40:51,270 --> 01:40:52,739
Let's go! Let's go!

1306
01:40:57,680 --> 01:41:00,349
Okay? When did you
break your gear lever?

1307
01:41:00,350 --> 01:41:02,149
Nine or ten laps ago.

1308
01:41:02,149 --> 01:41:04,519
- Alistair, we need to lift it!
- Come on!

1309
01:41:04,520 --> 01:41:06,259
- At the front!
- Let's go!

1310
01:41:06,260 --> 01:41:09,359
<i>Regazzoni's Ferrari and
Jacques Lafitte in the Ligier</i>

1311
01:41:09,359 --> 01:41:11,088
<i>have gone ahead.</i>

1312
01:41:11,090 --> 01:41:12,489
Come on, hurry!

1313
01:41:13,029 --> 01:41:16,159
You did it. You're going
to be World Champion!

1314
01:41:16,670 --> 01:41:17,689
Not yet.

1315
01:41:17,689 --> 01:41:21,269
<i>A few laps ago, James Hunt was
looking like champion elect.</i>

1316
01:41:21,270 --> 01:41:24,170
<i>Now it looks as though it's
all gone wrong for him.</i>

1317
01:41:25,569 --> 01:41:27,009
- James.
- Come on!

1318
01:41:27,010 --> 01:41:28,139
- Listen.
- What?

1319
01:41:28,140 --> 01:41:30,509
Just go easy out there.

1320
01:41:30,510 --> 01:41:34,418
- What are you saying?
- I'm saying look after yourself.

1321
01:41:34,420 --> 01:41:36,649
We want you back in one piece.

1322
01:41:36,649 --> 01:41:40,019
You're too far back. There's too
many drivers in front of you.

1323
01:41:40,020 --> 01:41:43,420
- There's always next year.
- So that's it? It's over?

1324
01:41:44,430 --> 01:41:45,390
Clear!

1325
01:41:45,989 --> 01:41:46,960
James!

1326
01:41:48,600 --> 01:41:50,590
- Clear!
- Fuck it!

1327
01:41:54,970 --> 01:41:57,769
<i>James Hunt rejoins the
race in sixth position.</i>

1328
01:41:57,770 --> 01:42:02,010
<i>There are four laps to go.
Surely no way back for the Brit.</i>

1329
01:42:21,600 --> 01:42:23,298
Concentrate, Superstar.

1330
01:42:23,300 --> 01:42:25,298
<i>Just brings it back
under control!</i>

1331
01:42:25,300 --> 01:42:28,270
<i>Sliding the McLaren on
the very edge there.</i>

1332
01:42:30,170 --> 01:42:33,038
<i>Hunt's M23 twitching this
way and that under braking.</i>

1333
01:42:33,039 --> 01:42:34,408
<i>And he almost loses
it right there.</i>

1334
01:42:34,409 --> 01:42:36,009
<i>Hunt on the tail
of Jacques Lafitte</i>

1335
01:42:36,010 --> 01:42:37,569
<i>in the blue Ligier.</i>

1336
01:42:45,189 --> 01:42:46,949
Don't do it, James.

1337
01:42:49,460 --> 01:42:51,229
<i>He's inches away
from the pit wall!</i>

1338
01:42:51,229 --> 01:42:53,350
<i>He's inches away
from the Ligier!</i>

1339
01:43:02,300 --> 01:43:04,509
<i>James Hunt has made
up another place,</i>

1340
01:43:04,510 --> 01:43:07,670
<i>but it's not enough and
this race is running out.</i>

1341
01:43:16,119 --> 01:43:19,050
<i>And Watson has spun!
Watson has spun!</i>

1342
01:43:22,390 --> 01:43:25,429
<i>Hunt manages to weave his
way between the back marker</i>

1343
01:43:25,430 --> 01:43:27,698
<i>and the stationary Penske.</i>

1344
01:43:27,699 --> 01:43:30,328
<i>He's catching Regazzoni,
but in these conditions,</i>

1345
01:43:30,329 --> 01:43:33,960
<i>it's one thing to catch up,
quite another to overtake.</i>

1346
01:43:37,109 --> 01:43:39,668
<i>He's alongside Clay Regazzoni!
This could be</i>

1347
01:43:39,670 --> 01:43:41,609
<i>the world championship!</i>

1348
01:43:49,279 --> 01:43:51,010
<i>He's got him!</i>

1349
01:44:06,439 --> 01:44:08,298
<i>Hunt crosses the line.</i>

1350
01:44:08,300 --> 01:44:11,408
<i>He needed to finish third
to score enough points</i>

1351
01:44:11,409 --> 01:44:13,009
<i>to be World Champion,</i>

1352
01:44:13,010 --> 01:44:15,338
<i>and in the confusion
here we're being told</i>

1353
01:44:15,340 --> 01:44:17,078
<i>that he may have finished 5th.</i>

1354
01:44:17,079 --> 01:44:18,210
He finished fifth?

1355
01:44:19,449 --> 01:44:22,048
<i>Our lap charts show
Hunt in third place.</i>

1356
01:44:22,050 --> 01:44:23,918
<i>Well, if the scoreboard's right,</i>

1357
01:44:23,920 --> 01:44:26,559
<i>it means he's just missed
out on the championship.</i>

1358
01:44:26,560 --> 01:44:30,180
<i>Crushing defeat for Hunt
after such a heroic drive.</i>

1359
01:44:34,159 --> 01:44:36,429
<i>I can see the race
stewards conferring,</i>

1360
01:44:36,430 --> 01:44:38,698
<i>examining the
official lap charts.</i>

1361
01:44:38,699 --> 01:44:41,930
<i>We're just going to have to
wait for their verdict here.</i>

1362
01:44:58,590 --> 01:45:00,059
Let's get you out
of here, buddy.

1363
01:45:00,060 --> 01:45:02,319
I'm sorry, Teddy. I thought
I could make up the ground.

1364
01:45:02,319 --> 01:45:04,429
Sony? What are you talking about?
You did it!

1365
01:45:04,430 --> 01:45:07,328
- Did what?
- Jesus! You crazy bastard!

1366
01:45:07,329 --> 01:45:09,969
You came 3rd! You
got the points!

1367
01:45:09,970 --> 01:45:11,599
You're champion of the world!

1368
01:45:11,600 --> 01:45:14,639
<i>James Hunt is now
officially confirmed</i>

1369
01:45:14,640 --> 01:45:17,238
<i>as finishing third
here in Japan,</i>

1370
01:45:17,239 --> 01:45:20,500
<i>and that means he is
champion of the world.</i>

1371
01:45:22,210 --> 01:45:24,908
<i>Our new World
Champion, James Hunt,</i>

1372
01:45:24,909 --> 01:45:27,439
<i>by just one single point.</i>

1373
01:45:33,260 --> 01:45:35,159
<i>Did we really win?</i>

1374
01:45:38,229 --> 01:45:40,390
World bloody Champion!

1375
01:45:49,170 --> 01:45:53,039
- What are you going to do now?
- I shall be getting drunk.

1376
01:45:54,010 --> 01:45:56,479
It's wonderful, absolute dream.

1377
01:46:42,989 --> 01:46:46,628
<i>And our special guest, Formula
1 champion, James Hunt.</i>

1378
01:46:46,630 --> 01:46:49,289
JAMES HUNT WORLD CHAMPION

1379
01:46:59,210 --> 01:47:01,229
JAMES HUNT AGAINST ALL ODDS

1380
01:47:11,090 --> 01:47:13,109
Wait. Come on.

1381
01:47:15,659 --> 01:47:19,020
There's no better motor
oil than Havoline.

1382
01:47:29,899 --> 01:47:33,208
- Yes, me too. Where we going?
- Anywhere I want to go.

1383
01:47:33,210 --> 01:47:35,679
And I don't have to
hijack it, either.

1384
01:47:35,680 --> 01:47:37,948
As long as I pay for it.

1385
01:47:37,949 --> 01:47:40,380
I'm starving. Let's
get some food.

1386
01:47:46,449 --> 01:47:48,449
BOLOGNA, ITALY

1387
01:47:51,060 --> 01:47:53,029
- Where are you going?
- You lot go ahead.

1388
01:47:53,029 --> 01:47:54,930
I won't be a minute.

1389
01:47:56,460 --> 01:47:57,430
Niki!

1390
01:48:00,439 --> 01:48:01,930
Good to see you!

1391
01:48:06,239 --> 01:48:08,208
I heard you were spending
more and more time

1392
01:48:08,210 --> 01:48:10,448
- in one of these.
- Do you fly?

1393
01:48:10,449 --> 01:48:11,448
No.

1394
01:48:11,449 --> 01:48:14,179
- I don't think they'd insure me.
- You should try.

1395
01:48:14,180 --> 01:48:15,418
It's good for discipline.

1396
01:48:15,420 --> 01:48:16,988
You have to stay
within the rules,

1397
01:48:16,989 --> 01:48:18,689
stick to regulation,
suppress the ego.

1398
01:48:18,689 --> 01:48:20,618
It helps with the racing.

1399
01:48:20,619 --> 01:48:23,359
And there I was thinking you
were about to wax lyrical

1400
01:48:23,359 --> 01:48:26,920
- about the romance of flight.
- No, that's all bullshit.

1401
01:48:28,399 --> 01:48:30,269
So what brings you here?

1402
01:48:30,270 --> 01:48:32,029
A friend's wedding.

1403
01:48:32,029 --> 01:48:33,368
At least I think
it was a wedding.

1404
01:48:33,369 --> 01:48:34,599
Might have been a
birthday or something.

1405
01:48:34,600 --> 01:48:36,269
It's all a bit of a blur.

1406
01:48:36,270 --> 01:48:39,168
- Have you been at Fiorano?
- Pre-season testing.

1407
01:48:39,170 --> 01:48:41,139
- You're relentless.
- Thank you.

1408
01:48:41,140 --> 01:48:43,078
I'm not sure that was
meant as a compliment.

1409
01:48:43,079 --> 01:48:45,948
When do you start testing?
Next week?

1410
01:48:45,949 --> 01:48:47,649
No. What, are you nuts?

1411
01:48:47,649 --> 01:48:49,279
I didn't just win the
biggest thing of my life

1412
01:48:49,279 --> 01:48:51,590
so I could get right
back to work.

1413
01:48:51,989 --> 01:48:54,229
Why? You have to.

1414
01:48:54,689 --> 01:48:56,618
To prove to all the people

1415
01:48:56,619 --> 01:48:58,458
who will always say you
just won it because...

1416
01:48:58,460 --> 01:49:01,899
Because of what? Because
of your accident?

1417
01:49:03,029 --> 01:49:05,969
Niki, is that other
people or is that you?

1418
01:49:05,970 --> 01:49:07,368
I won, okay?

1419
01:49:07,369 --> 01:49:09,168
On the all-important day
when it came down to it,

1420
01:49:09,170 --> 01:49:12,109
we raced on equal terms,
equally good cars.

1421
01:49:12,109 --> 01:49:14,338
And I put my life on the
line and I saw it through.

1422
01:49:14,340 --> 01:49:16,378
- And you call that winning?
- Yes.

1423
01:49:16,380 --> 01:49:19,009
The risks were totally
unacceptable.

1424
01:49:19,010 --> 01:49:20,679
You were prepared to die.

1425
01:49:20,680 --> 01:49:23,219
- To me, that's losing.
- Yes, I was. I admit it.

1426
01:49:23,220 --> 01:49:26,048
I was prepared to die
to beat you that day.

1427
01:49:26,050 --> 01:49:28,059
And that's the effect
you have on me.

1428
01:49:28,060 --> 01:49:31,119
You'd pushed me that far.
And it felt great!

1429
01:49:31,630 --> 01:49:34,259
I mean, hell, isn't that
what we're in this for?

1430
01:49:34,260 --> 01:49:37,060
To stare death in the
face and to cheat it?

1431
01:49:37,970 --> 01:49:40,069
Come on, there's
nobility in that.

1432
01:49:40,069 --> 01:49:41,970
It's like being knights.

1433
01:49:42,270 --> 01:49:44,668
You English, you're
such assholes.

1434
01:49:44,670 --> 01:49:46,939
You know my position.

1435
01:49:46,939 --> 01:49:48,179
20% risk.

1436
01:49:48,180 --> 01:49:50,948
No, Niki, don't bring the
percentages into this.

1437
01:49:50,949 --> 01:49:52,408
Don't be a pro.

1438
01:49:52,409 --> 01:49:55,149
The minute you do that, you
kill what's good about this.

1439
01:49:55,149 --> 01:49:56,909
You kill the sport.

1440
01:49:59,949 --> 01:50:00,920
James!

1441
01:50:01,920 --> 01:50:02,909
James!

1442
01:50:06,590 --> 01:50:08,119
I've got to go.

1443
01:50:09,600 --> 01:50:11,659
Careful in this thing.

1444
01:50:12,630 --> 01:50:13,689
James.

1445
01:50:19,310 --> 01:50:22,899
In hospital, the toughest part
of my treatment was the vacuum.

1446
01:50:23,380 --> 01:50:25,448
Pumping the shit
out of my lungs.

1447
01:50:25,449 --> 01:50:26,970
It was hell.

1448
01:50:27,420 --> 01:50:30,019
And while doing it, I was
watching television.

1449
01:50:30,020 --> 01:50:32,948
- You winning all my points.
- Your points?

1450
01:50:32,949 --> 01:50:35,958
"That bastard, Hunt," I'd say.
"I hate that guy."

1451
01:50:35,960 --> 01:50:37,729
And one day, the
doctor came and said,

1452
01:50:37,729 --> 01:50:40,359
"Mr. Lauda, may I offer
a piece of advice?"

1453
01:50:40,359 --> 01:50:42,599
"Stop thinking of it as a
curse to have been given

1454
01:50:42,600 --> 01:50:44,198
an enemy in life."

1455
01:50:44,199 --> 01:50:46,198
"It can be blessing too."

1456
01:50:46,199 --> 01:50:47,769
"A wise man gets more
from his enemies

1457
01:50:47,770 --> 01:50:49,668
than a fool from his friends."

1458
01:50:49,670 --> 01:50:52,439
And you know what? He was right.

1459
01:50:54,340 --> 01:50:55,679
Look at us.

1460
01:50:55,680 --> 01:50:58,378
We were both a pair
of kids when we met.

1461
01:50:58,380 --> 01:51:00,649
Hot-headed jerks in Formula 3.

1462
01:51:00,649 --> 01:51:03,739
Disowned by our families.
Headed nowhere.

1463
01:51:04,420 --> 01:51:07,288
And now we're both
champions of the world.

1464
01:51:07,289 --> 01:51:08,979
It was not bad.

1465
01:51:09,359 --> 01:51:11,389
No, it's not bad.

1466
01:51:11,390 --> 01:51:13,559
So don't let me down now.

1467
01:51:13,560 --> 01:51:15,458
I need you busting my balls.

1468
01:51:15,460 --> 01:51:18,460
- Get back to work.
- I will, Niki, I will.

1469
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:21,368
But I intend to
enjoy myself first.

1470
01:51:21,369 --> 01:51:23,939
Some of life needs
to be for pleasure.

1471
01:51:23,939 --> 01:51:27,139
What's the point of having a
million cups, medals and planes

1472
01:51:27,140 --> 01:51:29,609
if you don't have any fun?

1473
01:51:30,079 --> 01:51:32,340
How is that winning?

1474
01:51:33,279 --> 01:51:36,149
- James!
- We're gonna leave without you!

1475
01:51:36,149 --> 01:51:37,140
James!

1476
01:51:41,289 --> 01:51:43,449
I'll see you on race day, champ.

1477
01:51:44,489 --> 01:51:45,649
You will...

1478
01:51:46,090 --> 01:51:47,060
champ.

1479
01:51:49,260 --> 01:51:51,469
You look good, Niki.

1480
01:51:51,470 --> 01:51:55,329
The only guy to have burnt his
face and it be an improvement.

1481
01:52:01,239 --> 01:52:03,939
<i>Of course he didn't
listen to me.</i>

1482
01:52:04,210 --> 01:52:07,448
<i>For James, one world
title was enough.</i>

1483
01:52:07,449 --> 01:52:10,439
<i>He had proved what
he needed to prove,</i>

1484
01:52:10,720 --> 01:52:14,279
<i>to himself and anyone
who doubted him.</i>

1485
01:52:15,189 --> 01:52:18,059
<i>And two years later he retired.</i>

1486
01:52:18,060 --> 01:52:21,260
<i>When I saw him next in
London seven years later,</i>

1487
01:52:21,600 --> 01:52:23,698
<i>me as champion again,</i>

1488
01:52:23,699 --> 01:52:25,429
<i>him as broadcaster,</i>

1489
01:52:25,430 --> 01:52:29,340
<i>he was barefoot on a
bicycle, with a flat tyre.</i>

1490
01:52:29,939 --> 01:52:33,069
<i>Still living each
day like his last.</i>

1491
01:52:34,239 --> 01:52:38,079
<i>When I heard he'd died aged
45, of a heart attack,</i>

1492
01:52:38,380 --> 01:52:40,350
<i>I wasn't surprised.</i>

1493
01:52:40,949 --> 01:52:42,970
<i>I was just sad.</i>

1494
01:52:43,479 --> 01:52:46,449
<i>People always think
of us as rivals,</i>

1495
01:52:46,989 --> 01:52:50,189
<i>but he was among the
very few I liked</i>

1496
01:52:51,029 --> 01:52:53,930
<i>and even fewer that I respected.</i>

1497
01:52:57,100 --> 01:53:00,189
<i>He remains the only
person I envied.</i>

1
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:52,150
Anything goes

2
00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:02,600
Anything goes

3
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:24,450
Anything goes.

4
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:49,640
Anything goes.

5
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:10,790
Be careful.

6
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:28,980
You never told me you spoke
my language Dr. Jones.

7
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:31,980
Only on special occasions.

8
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:35,080
So it is true?

9
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:37,090
You found Nurhachi?

10
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,620
You know I did.

11
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:42,290
Last night one of your boys
tried to get Nurhachi

12
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:44,400
without paying for him.

13
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:45,930
You have insulted my son.

14
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,090
No you have insulted me.

15
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,570
I spared his life.

16
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:53,370
Aren't you going
to introduce us?

17
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:58,730
This is Willie Scott.

18
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:03,580
This is Indiana Jones
famous archaeologist.

19
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:06,550
Well I thought archaeologists
were always funny little men

20
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:09,250
searching for their mommies.

21
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,550
Mummies.

22
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:13,250
Dr. Jones found Nurhachi for me

23
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,850
and he's going to deliver him...

24
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:16,990
now.

25
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:19,990
Say who is the Nurhac...

26
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:21,260
...hachi?!

27
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:23,130
Put the gun away sonny.

28
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:29,740
I suggest you give me
what you owe me

29
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:31,070
or anything goes.

30
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:32,080
Ooh.

31
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:43,150
Open it.

32
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:51,160
The diamond Lao.

33
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:53,890
The deal was for the diamond.

34
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,920
Oh Lao...

35
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:20,520
Ow!

36
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:24,260
To your very good health.

37
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:25,700
Lao!

38
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:26,730
He put a hole...

39
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,170
he put two holes in my dress
from Paris!

40
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,530
Sit down!

41
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:39,540
Now you bring me Nurhachi.

42
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:41,050
My pleasure.

43
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:44,810
Who on Earth is this Nurhachi?

44
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:49,680
Here he is.

45
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:56,630
This Nurhachi's
a real small guy.

46
00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:03,230
Inside are the remains
of Nurhachi...

47
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:07,470
first Emperor of Manchu Dynasty.

48
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:10,810
Welcome home old boy.

49
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:23,250
And now you give me
the diamond.

50
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:25,920
Are you trying to develop
a sense of humor

51
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:27,960
or am I going deaf?

52
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:34,690
What's that?

53
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:36,700
Antidote.

54
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:38,740
To what?

55
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:42,540
The poison you just drank
Dr. Jones.

56
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:50,040
The poison works fast
Dr. Jones.

57
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:00,290
- Lao.
- Lao!

58
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,230
You keep the girl.

59
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,490
I find another.

60
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:08,860
Good service here.

61
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:10,200
That's not a waiter.

62
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:12,530
Wu Han's an old friend.

63
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:14,600
Game's not over Lao.

64
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:16,400
Antidote.

65
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:32,490
Indy...

66
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,600
Don't worry Wu Han
I'll get you out of here.

67
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:40,830
Not this time Indy.

68
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:44,670
I followed you
on many adventures...

69
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:47,100
but into the great
unknown mystery...

70
00:07:47,170 --> 00:07:49,140
I go first Indy.

71
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:55,680
Don't be sad Dr. Jones.

72
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:58,050
You will soon be joining him.

73
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:06,560
Too much to drink Dr. Jones?

74
00:08:58,310 --> 00:08:59,640
Oh nuts!

75
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:06,540
Oh!

76
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:10,480
The antidote.

77
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,650
Where's the diamond?

78
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:43,210
No!

79
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,690
Stay there!

80
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:31,630
Come on.

81
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:35,770
I don't want to die!

82
00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:48,550
Who are you?

83
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,630
Wow! Holy smoke!

84
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:56,790
Crash landing!

85
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:59,830
Short Round step on it.

86
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:01,370
Okeydokey Dr. Jones.

87
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:03,200
Hold on to your potatoes.

88
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:05,360
For crying out loud
there's a kid driving the car!

89
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:22,020
Wow!

90
00:11:22,090 --> 00:11:23,180
Wow.

91
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,520
Where's the antidote?
Let me have it.

92
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:29,290
Listen I just met you
for Christ's sakes.

93
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,800
Give me...

94
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:32,160
Oh I'm not that kind of girl.

95
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:34,720
Hey Dr. Jones
no time for love.

96
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,290
We got company.

97
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:42,630
Oh I hope you choke.

98
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:47,570
No shooting.

99
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:05,500
Okay you asked for it.

100
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:27,890
This is fun!

101
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:31,480
Here hold this.

102
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:38,130
Where's my gun?

103
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,290
Where's my gun?!

104
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:42,660
I burnt my fingers
and I cracked a nail!

105
00:12:51,810 --> 00:12:53,300
Ah Dr. Jones...

106
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:54,310
I'm Art Weber.

107
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:55,870
I spoke with your assistant.

108
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:57,880
Uh we've managed
to secure three seats

109
00:12:57,950 --> 00:13:00,040
but there might be
a slight inconvenience

110
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:03,420
as you will be riding
on a cargo full of live poultry.

111
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:04,650
Is he kidding?

112
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,820
Madam it's the best I could do
on such short notice.

113
00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:09,450
Heavens aren't you
Willie Scott

114
00:13:09,530 --> 00:13:11,590
the famous American
female vocalist?

115
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,130
Owe you a gin.

116
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:26,270
Nice try Lao Che.

117
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:32,850
Good-bye Dr. Jones.

118
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:14,050
So what are you supposed to be
a lion tamer?

119
00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:16,530
I'm allowing you to tag along

120
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:19,930
so why don't you give
your mouth a rest?

121
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,090
Okay doll?

122
00:14:22,170 --> 00:14:23,970
What do you mean "tag along"?

123
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,900
Ever since
you got into my club

124
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:27,910
you haven't been able
to take your eyes off me.

125
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:29,870
Oh yeah?

126
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:07,160
Oh no...

127
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,670
Oh no!

128
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:10,500
Mister mister...

129
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:12,130
Oh mister wake up.
Please mister...

130
00:16:12,210 --> 00:16:14,240
You call him Dr. Jones doll!

131
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:16,250
Okay Dr. Jones Dr. Jones.

132
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,810
Oh wake up please!

133
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:18,980
Are we there already?

134
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:19,980
Oh good.

135
00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:21,020
No.

136
00:16:21,090 --> 00:16:22,050
Huh?

137
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:25,690
No one's flying the plane!

138
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:26,850
Oh boy...

139
00:16:28,430 --> 00:16:29,690
They've all gone!

140
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:35,690
You know how to fly
don't you?

141
00:16:35,770 --> 00:16:37,930
No. Do you?

142
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:38,940
Oh no.

143
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,470
- Oh my God!
- How hard can it be?

144
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:41,530
- I'm gonna faint.
- Altimeter!

145
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:42,800
Okay.

146
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,100
Air speed.

147
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:45,270
Uh okay.

148
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:46,280
Fuel...

149
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:48,210
Fuel?

150
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:50,340
Fuel?!

151
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:06,490
I think we got a big problem.

152
00:17:06,570 --> 00:17:08,030
Dr. Jones!
Shorty!

153
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:11,040
Dr. Jones!
No more parachutes!

154
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,070
- Oh...
- Shorty!

155
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:15,400
- Come on give me a hand!
- What's that?

156
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:16,910
Move the box!

157
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:18,810
Dr. Jones you're crazy!

158
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:25,180
Shorty get our stuff!

159
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:30,810
A boat?

160
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:33,090
We're not sinking.

161
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,150
We're crashing!

162
00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:37,230
Grab on Shorty!

163
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:38,230
Grab on!

164
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:40,030
- Lady I can't breathe!
- Tight!

165
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:21,130
Slow it down!

166
00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:24,270
That wasn't so bad was it?

167
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:41,260
Aah! Put on the brakes!

168
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:48,600
I hate the water
and I hate being wet

169
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:49,730
and I hate you!

170
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,460
Good.

171
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:52,870
Good!

172
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:20,360
Dr. Jones?

173
00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:22,230
I'm all right Shorty.

174
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:23,630
You okay?

175
00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:35,140
Oh where are we anyway?

176
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:41,110
India.

177
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:42,680
How do you know that?

178
00:21:34,770 --> 00:21:37,130
Oh I sure hope
this means dinner.

179
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,330
God I'm starving.

180
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:40,840
Thank you.

181
00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:49,610
I can't eat this.

182
00:21:51,850 --> 00:21:54,750
That's more food than these
people eat in a week.

183
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:55,840
They're starving.

184
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:58,250
Oh I'm sorry.
You can have...

185
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,590
Eat it.

186
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,360
I'm not hungry.

187
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:07,130
You're insulting them

188
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,570
and you're embarrassing me.

189
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:12,040
Eat it.
Eat it.

190
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:13,470
Eat.

191
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:29,180
Bad news coming.

192
00:22:30,490 --> 00:22:34,120
Can you provide us with a guide
to take us to Delhi?

193
00:22:34,190 --> 00:22:35,130
I'm a professor.

194
00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:37,220
I have to get back
to my university.

195
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:39,560
Yes. Sajnu will guide you.

196
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:47,500
On the way to Delhi
you will stop at Pankot.

197
00:22:47,570 --> 00:22:50,700
Pankot is not
on the way to Delhi.

198
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:53,040
You will go to Pankot Palace.

199
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:54,810
I thought the palace
had been deserted

200
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,540
since uh... the 1850s.

201
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:59,280
No. Now there is
a new maharaja

202
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:04,380
and again the palace
has the power of the Dark Light.

203
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:08,450
It is that place
kill my people.

204
00:23:08,530 --> 00:23:10,120
What has happened here?

205
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:13,100
The evil start in Pankot...

206
00:23:13,170 --> 00:23:17,230
then like monsoon...

207
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:21,930
it moves darkness...

208
00:23:22,010 --> 00:23:25,140
over all country...

209
00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:27,740
over all country.

210
00:23:27,810 --> 00:23:29,610
The evil?

211
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:33,780
What evil?

212
00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:35,290
See? Bad news.

213
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:37,790
You listen to Suwamu.
You leave Lanka.

214
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:39,790
Shh...

215
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:44,990
They came from palace...

216
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:47,790
and took Sivalinga...

217
00:23:47,870 --> 00:23:50,130
from our village.

218
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,640
Took what?

219
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:52,900
It's a stone...

220
00:23:52,970 --> 00:23:55,570
a sacred stone from the shrine
that protects the village.

221
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:58,440
It is why Siva brought you here.

222
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,250
We weren't brought here.

223
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:12,590
Our plane crashed.

224
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:14,390
It crashed.

225
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:16,790
No no.

226
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:21,960
We prayed to Siva
to help us find the stone.

227
00:24:22,030 --> 00:24:24,060
It was Siva

228
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:29,270
who made you fall
from the sky.

229
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:37,110
So you will go to Pankot Palace
to find Sivilinga and bring back

230
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:38,620
to us.

231
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:43,120
Bring back to us.
Bring back to us.

232
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:45,420
Bring back to us.

233
00:24:46,490 --> 00:24:48,480
Dr. Jones did they
make the plane crash

234
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:50,890
to get you here?

235
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,560
No Shorty
it's just a ghost story.

236
00:24:52,630 --> 00:24:54,160
Don't worry about it.

237
00:24:58,970 --> 00:25:01,770
They took the stone from here.

238
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:10,110
Was the stone very smooth
like a rock from a sacred river?

239
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:11,480
Yes.

240
00:25:11,550 --> 00:25:12,680
With three lines across it

241
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:14,690
representing the three levels
of the universe.

242
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:16,520
That's right.
Yes.

243
00:25:16,590 --> 00:25:19,420
I've seen stones
like the one you lost.

244
00:25:19,490 --> 00:25:23,520
But why would Maharaja
take the sacred stone from here?

245
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:28,030
They says we must pray
to their evil god.

246
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:31,700
We says we will not.

247
00:25:31,770 --> 00:25:32,900
Excuse me

248
00:25:32,970 --> 00:25:35,600
I don't understand how one rock
could destroy a whole village.

249
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:42,610
He's saying when
the sacred stone was taken

250
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:43,740
the village wells dried up

251
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:45,310
and the river turned to sand.

252
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:51,960
The crops were swallowed
by the earth

253
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:55,550
and the animals laid down
and turned to dust.

254
00:25:55,630 --> 00:25:58,990
Then one night there
was a fire in the fields.

255
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:02,360
The men went out
to fight the fire.

256
00:26:02,430 --> 00:26:05,670
When they came back the women
were crying in the darkness.

257
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:18,980
Children.

258
00:26:19,050 --> 00:26:22,080
He says
they stole their children.

259
00:27:11,570 --> 00:27:13,870
Sankara! Sankara...

260
00:27:17,110 --> 00:27:19,170
Ranjit!

261
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:21,440
Ranjit!

262
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,410
Sankara.

263
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:09,090
Little boy escaped
from the evil palace.

264
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:11,860
Many other children
still there.

265
00:28:11,930 --> 00:28:15,200
What we do Dr. Jones?

266
00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:24,500
What you think?

267
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:26,740
I think that somebody believes

268
00:28:26,810 --> 00:28:29,580
the good luck rock
from this village

269
00:28:29,650 --> 00:28:32,170
is one of the lost
Sankara stones.

270
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:35,010
What is Sankara?

271
00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:37,250
Fortune and glory kid.

272
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:40,990
Fortune and glory.

273
00:29:04,450 --> 00:29:07,480
Willie quit monkeying around
on that thing.

274
00:29:17,030 --> 00:29:18,660
Oh wait a second! Indy!

275
00:29:18,730 --> 00:29:21,060
I can't go to Delhi like this!

276
00:29:21,130 --> 00:29:22,660
We're not going to Delhi doll.

277
00:29:22,730 --> 00:29:25,070
We're going to Pankot Palace.

278
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:27,160
Pankot?!

279
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:29,370
I can't go to Pankot!
I'm a singer.

280
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:30,970
Oh I need to call my agent.

281
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:32,070
Is there a phone?

282
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:33,610
Anybody I need a phone!

283
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:10,340
Eww!

284
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:27,530
Oh quit complaining.
This is expensive stuff.

285
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:31,830
You come to America with me
and we get job in circus.

286
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:33,840
You like that?
You like America?

287
00:30:33,910 --> 00:30:35,600
You're my best friend.

288
00:30:35,670 --> 00:30:37,800
You're my best friend.

289
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:41,310
Ooh what big birds!

290
00:30:41,450 --> 00:30:44,710
Those aren't big
birds sweetheart.

291
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:47,750
They're giant vampire bats.

292
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:49,220
Bats?

293
00:30:57,730 --> 00:31:00,600
Oh pipe down you big baboon.
This doesn't hurt.

294
00:31:00,670 --> 00:31:02,060
You know what you really need?

295
00:31:02,130 --> 00:31:04,400
You really need a bath.

296
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:16,210
Ha-ha very funny.

297
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:17,650
Very funny.

298
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:20,510
Very funny.

299
00:31:20,590 --> 00:31:22,580
All wet.

300
00:31:22,650 --> 00:31:26,420
I was happy in Shanghai.

301
00:31:26,490 --> 00:31:30,150
I had a little house...
and a garden.

302
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:32,520
My friends were rich.

303
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:35,830
We went to parties
all the time in limousines.

304
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:38,530
I hate being outside!

305
00:31:40,210 --> 00:31:41,730
I'm a singer!

306
00:31:41,810 --> 00:31:44,270
I could lose my voice!

307
00:31:45,710 --> 00:31:48,270
I think
we'll camp here tonight.

308
00:31:49,710 --> 00:31:50,840
Cut it out.

309
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:58,650
What do you got?

310
00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:59,710
Two sixes.

311
00:31:59,790 --> 00:32:01,090
Aha-ha three aces.

312
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:02,250
I win.

313
00:32:02,330 --> 00:32:04,260
Two more game
I have all your money.

314
00:32:04,330 --> 00:32:05,460
Ha ha ha!

315
00:32:07,030 --> 00:32:09,900
It's poker Shorty
anything can happen.

316
00:32:09,970 --> 00:32:12,900
Where did you find your
uh little bodyguard?

317
00:32:12,970 --> 00:32:15,460
I didn't find him
I caught him.

318
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:16,730
What?

319
00:32:16,810 --> 00:32:18,040
Shorty's family were killed

320
00:32:18,110 --> 00:32:19,870
when the Japanese
bombed Shanghai.

321
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:22,170
He's been living on the streets
since he was four.

322
00:32:22,250 --> 00:32:25,550
I caught him trying to pick my
pocket didn't I short stuff?

323
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:31,420
Biggest trouble with her
is the noise.

324
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:41,300
Hey! You cheat Dr. Jones.

325
00:32:41,370 --> 00:32:42,460
You cheat!

326
00:32:42,530 --> 00:32:44,090
What do you mean?

00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,070
- You pay now.
- Oh they were stuck together.

328
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:49,070
No stuck. No mistake.

329
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:50,440
They were stuck together.
It's a mistake.

330
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:52,570
I'm very little.
You cheat very big.

331
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:55,680

You pay money.
You owe me ten cent.

333

Look at this.
Look at this.

334
00:33:03,090 --> 00:33:04,520
You accuse me of cheating.

335
00:33:04,590 --> 00:33:06,420
You're cheating.

336
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,220
You make me poor.

337
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:14,600
No fun.

338
00:33:14,670 --> 00:33:15,930
Play with you no fun.

339
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,060
- I quit.
- I quit too.

340
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:21,370
Oh this place is
completely surrounded.

341
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:23,630
The entire place is crawling
with living things.

342
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:25,770
That's why they call it
the jungle sweetheart.

343
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,240
Oh my God
what else is out there?

344
00:33:27,310 --> 00:33:28,280
Willie wait...

345
00:33:28,410 --> 00:33:29,510
Oh!

346
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:35,880
Willie Willie...

347
00:33:35,950 --> 00:33:36,980
What is that?

348
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:39,290
Is that short for something?

349
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:42,990
"Willie" is my
professional name Indiana.

350
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:45,830
Hey lady
you call him Dr. Jones.

351
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:48,530
My professional name.

352
00:33:49,730 --> 00:33:52,290
Why are you dragging us off
to this deserted palace?

353
00:33:52,370 --> 00:33:53,840
Fortune and glory?

354
00:33:53,910 --> 00:33:55,340
Fortune and glory.

355
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:01,110
Well... this is a piece
of an old manuscript.

356
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:03,910
This pictograph
represents Sankara

357
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:05,240
a priest.

358
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:07,250
Scram.

359
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:08,750
Gentle. Gentle.

360
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:10,250
This is hundreds of years old.

361
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,880
Is that some kind of writing?

362
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:13,750
Yeah it's Sanskrit.

363
00:34:13,830 --> 00:34:14,810
Cut it out.

364
00:34:14,890 --> 00:34:17,450
It's part
of the legend of Sankara.

365
00:34:17,530 --> 00:34:18,550
He climbs Mount Kalisa

366
00:34:18,630 --> 00:34:20,360
where he meets Siva
the Hindu god.

367
00:34:20,430 --> 00:34:22,020
That's Siva?

368
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:24,160
And what's he handing
the priest?

369
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:25,960
Rocks.

370
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:27,270
Stop.

371
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:29,900
He told him to go
forth and combat evil.

372
00:34:29,970 --> 00:34:31,130
And to help him he gave him

373
00:34:31,210 --> 00:34:34,270
five sacred stones
with magical properties.

374
00:34:34,410 --> 00:34:36,040
Magic rocks?

375
00:34:36,110 --> 00:34:37,640
My grandpa was a magician.

376
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:39,880
He spent his entire life
with a rabbit in his pocket

377
00:34:39,950 --> 00:34:41,280
and pigeons up his sleeves.

378
00:34:41,350 --> 00:34:44,450
He made a lot of children happy
and died a very poor man.

379
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:47,390
Magic rocks.
Fortune and glory.

380
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:49,120
Sweet dreams Dr. Jones.

381
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:51,890
Where are you going?

382
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:55,230
I'd sleep closer if I were you.

383
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:57,000
For safety's sake.

384
00:34:57,070 --> 00:35:00,770
Dr. Jones I'd be safer
sleeping with a snake.

385
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:05,100
I said cut it out!

386
00:35:08,310 --> 00:35:12,040
I hate that elephant.

387
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:40,940
Indy look!

388
00:35:41,010 --> 00:35:43,610
I see it Shorty.

389
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:46,670
That's it: Pankot Palace.

390
00:37:03,730 --> 00:37:06,420
Dr. Jones what you look at?

391
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:09,330
Don't come up here.

392
00:37:15,470 --> 00:37:17,070
No! No no no no!

393
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:18,370
Don't leave! No!

394
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:20,240
No no no no no!

395
00:37:20,310 --> 00:37:22,910
Oh baby elephant stay here!

396
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:24,710
Oh no! Indy!

397
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:27,080
They're stealing our rides!

398
00:37:27,150 --> 00:37:30,210
We walk from here.

399
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:07,350
Hello.

400
00:38:07,430 --> 00:38:10,360
I should say
you look rather lost.

401
00:38:10,430 --> 00:38:11,860
But then I cannot imagine

402
00:38:11,930 --> 00:38:15,190
where in the world the three
of you would look at home.

403
00:38:15,270 --> 00:38:16,200
We're not lost.

404
00:38:16,270 --> 00:38:17,930
We're on our way to Delhi.

405
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,800
This is Miss Scott.

406
00:38:19,870 --> 00:38:22,000
This is Mr. Round.

407
00:38:22,070 --> 00:38:23,560
Short Round.

408
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:25,200
My name is Indiana Jones.

409
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:28,840
Dr. Jones the eminent
archaeologist?

410
00:38:28,910 --> 00:38:30,510
Hard to believe isn't it?

411
00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:31,510
Ah.

412
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:33,450
I remember first
hearing your name

413
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:34,850
when I was up at Oxford.

414
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:35,850
Oh.

415
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:37,820
I'm Chattar Lal Prime Minister

416
00:38:37,890 --> 00:38:40,590
to His Highness
the Maharaja of Pankot.

417
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:42,460
I'm enchanted.

418
00:38:42,530 --> 00:38:44,460
Enchanted.
Thank you very much.

419
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:45,790
Thank you very much.

420
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:47,990
Welcome to Pankot Palace!

421
00:38:50,670 --> 00:38:52,530
Enchanted huh?

422
00:39:04,350 --> 00:39:07,280
Shorty where's my razor?

423
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:33,080
We are fortunate tonight

424
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:35,840
to have so many
unexpected visitors.

425
00:39:35,910 --> 00:39:37,110
This is Captain...

426
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:39,480
...Blumburtt.
11th Poona Rifles.

427
00:39:39,550 --> 00:39:42,520
And you sir are
Dr. Jones I presume.

428
00:39:42,590 --> 00:39:44,250
I am Captain.

429
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:45,950
Captain Blumburtt and his troops

430
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:47,750
are on a routine
inspection tour.

431
00:39:47,830 --> 00:39:49,260
The British find it amusing

432
00:39:49,330 --> 00:39:51,260
to inspect us
at their convenience.

433
00:39:51,330 --> 00:39:52,590
I do hope sir

434
00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:56,460
that it's not uh
inconvenient to you uh... sir.

435
00:39:56,530 --> 00:40:00,270
The British worry so
about their empire.

436
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:03,310
Makes us all feel like
well-cared-for children.

437
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:13,450
Ah...

438
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:15,820
you look beautiful.

439
00:40:15,890 --> 00:40:18,450
I think the maharaja
is swimming in loot.

440
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:21,790
Maybe it wasn't such a bad
idea coming here after all.

441
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:24,190
You look like a princess.

442
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:28,720
Mr. Lal what do they call
the maharaja's wife?

443
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:31,200
His Highness
has not yet taken a wife.

444
00:40:31,270 --> 00:40:32,860
How interesting.

445
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:36,000
Well uh maybe it's because
he hasn't found the right woman.

446
00:40:49,250 --> 00:40:52,310
His Supreme Highness

447
00:40:52,390 --> 00:40:56,660
guardian of Pankot tradition

448
00:40:56,730 --> 00:40:59,990
the Maharaja of Pankot

449
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:02,730
Zalim Singh.

450
00:41:23,190 --> 00:41:26,280
That's the maharaja?

451
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:27,950
A kid?!

452
00:41:30,230 --> 00:41:33,490
Maybe he like older women.

453
00:41:41,210 --> 00:41:43,040
Captain Blumburtt
was just telling me

454
00:41:43,110 --> 00:41:45,740
something of the interesting
history of the palace...

455
00:41:45,810 --> 00:41:47,780
the importance it played
in the mutiny.

456
00:41:47,850 --> 00:41:52,510
It seems the British never
forget the Mutiny of 1857.

457
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:56,310
Yes well you know I think
there are other events...

458
00:41:56,420 --> 00:41:58,320
before the mutiny
going back a century

459
00:41:58,460 --> 00:42:01,150
back to the time of Clive...
that are more interesting.

460
00:42:01,230 --> 00:42:04,020
And what events are those
Dr. Jones?

461
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:05,930
Well if memory
serves me correctly

462
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,430
this area this province

463
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:09,730
was the center of activity
for the Thuggee.

464
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:11,600
Ah!

465
00:42:11,670 --> 00:42:15,260
Snake... Surprise.

466
00:42:15,410 --> 00:42:17,140
What's the surprise?

467
00:42:26,620 --> 00:42:29,680
Dr. Jones
you know perfectly well

468
00:42:29,750 --> 00:42:32,720
the Thuggee cult has been dead
for nearly a century.

469
00:42:32,790 --> 00:42:33,850
Yes of course.

470
00:42:33,930 --> 00:42:37,860
The Thuggee was an obscenity
that worshipped Kali

471
00:42:37,930 --> 00:42:39,450
with human sacrifices.

472
00:42:39,530 --> 00:42:42,760
The British Army
nicely did away with them.

473
00:42:45,770 --> 00:42:49,500
Well I suppose stories
of the Thuggee die hard.

474
00:42:49,570 --> 00:42:51,940
There are no stories anymore.

475
00:42:52,010 --> 00:42:54,170
I'm not so sure.

476
00:42:54,250 --> 00:42:56,300
We came from a small village.

477
00:42:56,450 --> 00:42:58,210
The peasants there told us

478
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:01,010
Pankot Palace
was growing powerful again

479
00:43:01,090 --> 00:43:03,110
because of some ancient evil.

480
00:43:03,190 --> 00:43:05,250
Village stories Dr. Jones.

481
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:09,090
They're just fear and folklore.

482
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:12,460
You're beginning to worry
Captain Blumburtt.

483
00:43:12,530 --> 00:43:16,160
I'm not worried
Mr. Prime Minister just uh...

484
00:43:16,230 --> 00:43:18,720
just um interested.

485
00:43:21,310 --> 00:43:22,330
Ah...

486
00:43:34,220 --> 00:43:37,150
What? You are not eating?

487
00:43:37,220 --> 00:43:40,950
I had bugs for lunch.

488
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:46,230
Give me your hat.

489
00:43:47,570 --> 00:43:49,090
Why?

490
00:43:49,170 --> 00:43:51,430
'Cause I'm gonna
puke in it. Oh!

491
00:43:53,470 --> 00:43:55,500
You know
the villagers also told us

492
00:43:55,570 --> 00:43:57,510
Pankot Palace
had taken something.

493
00:43:57,580 --> 00:44:00,410
Dr. Jones in our country

494
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:03,940
it's not usual for a guest
to insult his host.

495
00:44:04,020 --> 00:44:06,750
I'm sorry.

496
00:44:06,820 --> 00:44:09,250
I thought we were talking
about folklore.

497
00:44:09,350 --> 00:44:14,920
Excuse me sir do you have
anything simple like soup?

498
00:44:14,990 --> 00:44:18,220
What exactly was it
they say was stolen?

499
00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:20,700
A sacred rock.

500
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:23,660
Ha!

501
00:44:23,730 --> 00:44:26,360
You see Captain a rock!

502
00:44:27,910 --> 00:44:29,810
Ah!

503
00:44:34,180 --> 00:44:35,370
Ah...

504
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:43,620
Something connected...

505
00:44:43,690 --> 00:44:45,620
the villagers' rock

506
00:44:45,690 --> 00:44:48,990
and the old legend
of the Sankara Stones.

507
00:44:49,060 --> 00:44:53,020
Dr. Jones we are all vulnerable
to vicious rumors.

508
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:55,090
I seem to remember
that in Honduras

509
00:44:55,170 --> 00:44:57,500
you were accused
of being a grave robber

510
00:44:57,570 --> 00:44:59,260
rather than an archaeologist.

511
00:44:59,340 --> 00:45:02,770
Well the newspapers greatly
exaggerated the incident.

512
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:04,500
And wasn't it
the Sultan of Madagascar

513
00:45:04,580 --> 00:45:06,100
who threatened
to cut your head off

514
00:45:06,180 --> 00:45:07,670
if you ever returned
to his country?

515
00:45:07,750 --> 00:45:08,710
No it wasn't my head.

516
00:45:08,780 --> 00:45:10,080
Then your hands perhaps.

517
00:45:10,150 --> 00:45:12,410
No it wasn't my hands

518
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:14,420
it was my...

519
00:45:14,490 --> 00:45:15,920
my misunderstanding.

520
00:45:15,990 --> 00:45:18,110
Exactly what we have
here Dr. Jones.

521
00:45:18,190 --> 00:45:22,250
I have heard the evil stories
of the Thuggee cult.

522
00:45:22,330 --> 00:45:25,760
I thought the stories were told
to frighten children.

523
00:45:25,830 --> 00:45:29,030
Later I learnt
the Thuggee cult was once real

524
00:45:29,100 --> 00:45:32,160
and did of unspeakable things.

525
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:36,140
I am ashamed of what happened
here so many years ago

526
00:45:36,210 --> 00:45:37,400
and I assure you

527
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:41,540
this will never happen again
in my kingdom.

528
00:45:41,610 --> 00:45:45,070
If I offended you...

529
00:45:45,150 --> 00:45:47,620
then I am sorry.

530
00:45:56,730 --> 00:45:58,850
Ah dessert!

531
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:15,310
Chilled monkey brains.

532
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:32,290
Uh I think I'll
just check on Willie.

533
00:46:33,630 --> 00:46:35,760
That's all you better do.

534
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:39,570
Tell me later what happened.

535
00:46:39,640 --> 00:46:41,900
Am-scray.

536
00:46:50,450 --> 00:46:52,110
Ah.

537
00:46:52,180 --> 00:46:54,410
I've got something for you.

538
00:46:54,490 --> 00:46:58,080
There's nothing you have
that I could possibly want.

539
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:00,560
Right.

540
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:07,720
Oh.

541
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:10,670
Mmm mmm mmm.

542
00:47:10,730 --> 00:47:12,730
Mmm.

543
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:14,670
Oh you're a very nice man.

544
00:47:14,740 --> 00:47:17,370
Maybe you could be
my palace slave.

545
00:47:27,450 --> 00:47:29,510
Wear your jewels to bed
Princess?

546
00:47:29,590 --> 00:47:32,560
Yeah.

547
00:47:32,620 --> 00:47:35,460
And nothing else.

548
00:47:35,530 --> 00:47:37,260
That shock you?

549
00:47:37,330 --> 00:47:39,390
Nothing shocks me.

550
00:47:39,460 --> 00:47:41,950
I'm a scientist.

551
00:47:42,030 --> 00:47:45,730
So as a scientist you
do a lot of research?

552
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:48,200
Always.

553
00:47:48,270 --> 00:47:50,740
And what sort of research
would you do on me?

554
00:47:53,810 --> 00:47:55,800
Nocturnal activities.

555
00:47:55,880 --> 00:47:58,870
You mean like what sort of cream
I put on my face at night

556
00:47:58,950 --> 00:48:00,680
what position
I like to sleep in?

557
00:48:00,750 --> 00:48:02,220
Mating customs.

558
00:48:02,290 --> 00:48:03,340
Love rituals?

559
00:48:03,420 --> 00:48:06,010
Primitive sexual practices.

560
00:48:06,090 --> 00:48:08,180
So you're an authority
in that area?

561
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:09,890
Years of fieldwork.

562
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:11,220
Oh.

563
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:22,100
I don't blame you
for being sore at me.

564
00:48:22,170 --> 00:48:25,510
I can be hard to handle.

565
00:48:25,580 --> 00:48:27,510
I've had worse.

566
00:48:27,580 --> 00:48:30,640
But you'll never have better.

567
00:48:32,750 --> 00:48:34,680
I don't know.

568
00:48:34,750 --> 00:48:37,120
As a scientist I don't want
to prejudice my experiment.

569
00:48:37,190 --> 00:48:39,750
I'll let you know
in the morning.

570
00:48:39,820 --> 00:48:42,660
Why you conceited ape.

571
00:48:42,730 --> 00:48:45,750
I'm not that easy.

572
00:48:45,830 --> 00:48:48,990
I'm not that easy either.

573
00:48:49,070 --> 00:48:50,470
Trouble with you is Willie

574
00:48:50,530 --> 00:48:53,230
you're too used
to getting your own way.

575
00:48:53,300 --> 00:48:55,270
And you're just
too proud to admit

576
00:48:55,370 --> 00:48:58,470
that you're crazy about me
Dr. Jones.

577
00:48:58,540 --> 00:49:02,100
If you want me Willie
you know where you can find me.

578
00:49:02,180 --> 00:49:03,670
Five minutes.

579
00:49:03,750 --> 00:49:06,220
You'll be back over here
in five minutes.

580
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:07,810
I'll be asleep in five minutes.

581
00:49:07,890 --> 00:49:09,010
Five.

582
00:49:09,090 --> 00:49:11,320
You know it and I know it.

583
00:49:26,670 --> 00:49:28,660
Five minutes.

584
00:49:30,670 --> 00:49:32,510
Four and a half.

585
00:50:26,130 --> 00:50:27,320
"Palace slave."

586
00:50:28,570 --> 00:50:31,530
"Nocturnal activities."

587
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:33,830
I'm a "conceited ape"?

588
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:36,730
"I'll tell you in the morning."

589
00:50:38,610 --> 00:50:40,300
I can't believe it.

590
00:50:40,410 --> 00:50:42,210
He's not coming.

591
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:42,380
She's not coming.

592
00:50:42,380 --> 00:50:44,350
She's not coming.

593
00:50:46,180 --> 00:50:47,880
I can't believe I'm not going.

594
00:51:06,900 --> 00:51:09,570
Indiana Jones!

595
00:51:09,640 --> 00:51:12,400
This is one night
you'll never forget!

596
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:13,410
This is the night

597
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:15,540
I slipped right through
your fingers!

598
00:51:17,610 --> 00:51:19,100
Sleep tight...

599
00:51:19,180 --> 00:51:20,740
and pleasant dreams!

600
00:51:22,190 --> 00:51:26,350
I could have been
your greatest adventure.

601
00:51:36,930 --> 00:51:38,030
Dr. Jones your whip!

602
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:00,650
- Shorty...
- Huh?

603
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:01,820
Turn off the switch.

604
00:52:07,660 --> 00:52:09,630
Oh Indy.

605
00:52:10,570 --> 00:52:11,970
Oh be gentle with me.

606
00:52:12,040 --> 00:52:13,200
Be gentle with me.

607
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:21,410
But I'm here.

608
00:52:33,290 --> 00:52:34,280
There's nobody here.

609
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:37,290
No I'm here.

610
00:52:37,390 --> 00:52:41,020
Indy you're acting
awfully strange.

611
00:53:06,190 --> 00:53:08,920
Hey I'm right here.

612
00:53:21,100 --> 00:53:25,770
"Follow in the footsteps
of Siva."

613
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:28,040
What does that mean?

614
00:53:30,180 --> 00:53:34,080
"Do not betray these truths."

615
00:53:34,150 --> 00:53:36,710
Shorty go get our stuff.

616
00:54:05,650 --> 00:54:08,080
Stay behind me Short Round.

617
00:54:08,150 --> 00:54:12,850
Step where I step
and don't touch anything.

618
00:54:24,970 --> 00:54:26,660
I step where you step.

619
00:54:26,740 --> 00:54:29,500
I touch nothing.

620
00:54:29,570 --> 00:54:31,670
Indy!

621
00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:55,090
I step on something.

622
00:54:55,170 --> 00:54:57,690
Yeah there's something
on the ground.

623
00:54:57,770 --> 00:54:59,900
Feel like step
on fortune cookies.

624
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:03,200
It's not fortune cookies.

625
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:06,810
Let me take a look.

626
00:55:20,860 --> 00:55:22,690
That's no cookies.

627
00:55:22,760 --> 00:55:24,120
It's all right.
I got him.

628
00:55:28,100 --> 00:55:28,590
Ow!

629
00:55:28,670 --> 00:55:30,260
Go. There go.

630
00:56:10,340 --> 00:56:11,400
Stop.

631
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:13,740
Look just stand up
against the wall

632
00:56:13,810 --> 00:56:15,280
will you?

633
00:56:29,730 --> 00:56:31,750
You say to stand
against the wall!

634
00:56:31,830 --> 00:56:33,060
I listen to what you say!

635
00:56:33,130 --> 00:56:33,860
Not my fault! Not my fault!

636
00:56:33,930 --> 00:56:35,590
Willie get down here!

637
00:56:35,670 --> 00:56:37,430
We're in trouble!

638
00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:40,900
Willie!
Willie!

639
00:56:40,970 --> 00:56:43,500
Bet I get all dirty again.

640
00:56:43,570 --> 00:56:45,130
- Willie get down here!
- Not my fault!

641
00:56:45,210 --> 00:56:46,270
We're in trouble!

642
00:56:46,340 --> 00:56:47,280
Trouble?

643
00:56:47,340 --> 00:56:48,280
Trouble?

644
00:56:48,380 --> 00:56:49,740
What sort of?

645
00:57:04,690 --> 00:57:06,720
This is serious!

646
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:10,360
There are two dead people
down here!

647
00:57:10,430 --> 00:57:12,420
There're going to be
two dead people in here!

648
00:57:12,500 --> 00:57:13,470
Hurry!

649
00:57:13,540 --> 00:57:15,800
I've almost had enough
of you two.

650
00:57:15,870 --> 00:57:17,070
Willie!

651
00:57:17,140 --> 00:57:18,900
What's the rush?!

652
00:57:18,980 --> 00:57:20,240
It's a long story Willie.

653
00:57:20,340 --> 00:57:22,210
Hurry or you don't get
to hear it.

654
00:57:23,450 --> 00:57:27,140
Ooh God what is this?

655
00:57:28,390 --> 00:57:30,550
Indy what is this?

656
00:57:30,620 --> 00:57:31,750
I can't see a thing!

657
00:57:33,120 --> 00:57:34,780
Hurry!

658
00:57:34,860 --> 00:57:37,020
All right!

659
00:57:37,090 --> 00:57:38,150
Oh I broke a nail.

660
00:57:44,870 --> 00:57:49,640
Uh... Uh...

661
00:57:52,310 --> 00:57:54,170
Willie hurry!

662
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:56,270
They're in my hair!

663
00:57:56,350 --> 00:57:58,080
Aw shut up Willie!

664
00:58:00,250 --> 00:58:00,980
Indy let me in!

665
00:58:01,050 --> 00:58:01,920
No let us out!

666
00:58:01,990 --> 00:58:03,150
Let me in!

667
00:58:03,220 --> 00:58:03,980
Let us out!

668
00:58:04,050 --> 00:58:04,950
Shut up!

669
00:58:05,020 --> 00:58:07,180
I'm down here!
They're all over me!

670
00:58:07,260 --> 00:58:10,690
There's got to be a fulcrum
release lever somewhere.

671
00:58:10,760 --> 00:58:11,750
What?!

672
00:58:11,830 --> 00:58:13,820
A handle that opens the door.

673
00:58:13,900 --> 00:58:14,990
- Go on!

674
00:58:15,070 --> 00:58:16,330
- They're just
just square holes!

675
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:17,330
Go to the right hole.

676
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:19,700
Hurry Willie!

677
00:58:21,500 --> 00:58:22,660
Ooh...

678
00:58:26,910 --> 00:58:27,880
The other one!

679
00:58:27,940 --> 00:58:30,110
The other right.
Your other right!

680
00:58:30,180 --> 00:58:31,080
The one on your right!

681
00:58:31,150 --> 00:58:32,380
Oh there's slime inside!

682
00:58:32,450 --> 00:58:34,380
I can't do it.

683
00:58:34,450 --> 00:58:35,440
You can do it.

684
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:36,540
Feel inside.

685
00:58:36,620 --> 00:58:37,880
Okay.

686
00:58:40,860 --> 00:58:42,650
You feel inside!

687
00:58:42,730 --> 00:58:44,630
Do it now!

688
00:58:44,690 --> 00:58:45,990
Okay!

689
00:58:49,730 --> 00:58:51,390
Ooh!

690
00:58:51,470 --> 00:58:53,560
Ew!

691
00:58:56,240 --> 00:59:00,730
Willie we are going to die!

692
00:59:00,810 --> 00:59:02,610
It's soft.

693
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:06,750
It's moving!

694
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:15,850
Got it!

695
00:59:30,670 --> 00:59:32,610
Get 'em off of me!
Get 'em off of me!

696
00:59:32,680 --> 00:59:33,940
They're all over me!

697
00:59:34,010 --> 00:59:35,500
Get 'em off me!

698
00:59:36,750 --> 00:59:38,010
Huh?

699
00:59:38,080 --> 00:59:39,480
No!

700
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:43,510
It wasn't me! It's her!

701
00:59:43,590 --> 00:59:44,450
Huh?!

702
00:59:44,520 --> 00:59:46,180
Come on!

703
00:59:46,260 --> 00:59:47,690
Go! Move!

704
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:48,990
Come on move!

705
00:59:49,060 --> 00:59:50,860
Come on!

706
01:00:49,650 --> 01:00:52,320
It's a Thuggee ceremony.

707
01:00:52,390 --> 01:00:54,410
They're worshipping Kali.

708
01:01:02,600 --> 01:01:06,090
Have you ever seen anything
like this before?

709
01:01:06,170 --> 01:01:08,970
Nobody's seen this
for a hundred years.

710
01:02:43,100 --> 01:02:48,870
Kali Ma.
Kali Ma...

711
01:02:48,940 --> 01:02:50,960
Kali Ma!

712
01:03:27,110 --> 01:03:29,440
He's still alive.

713
01:04:53,660 --> 01:04:56,290
Kali Ma.

714
01:04:56,370 --> 01:04:59,670
Kali Ma...

715
01:05:56,390 --> 01:06:00,190
That's the rock they
took from the village.

716
01:06:00,260 --> 01:06:03,030
It's one of the Sankara Stones.

717
01:06:09,410 --> 01:06:10,900
Why they glow like that?

718
01:06:10,970 --> 01:06:13,410
Shh shh.

719
01:06:13,480 --> 01:06:14,910
The legend says

720
01:06:14,980 --> 01:06:16,450
when the rocks are
brought together

721
01:06:16,510 --> 01:06:19,610
the diamonds inside
them will glow.

722
01:06:19,680 --> 01:06:21,340
Diamonds?

723
01:06:21,420 --> 01:06:22,510
Diamonds.

724
01:06:22,590 --> 01:06:23,780
- Diamonds!
- Shh.

725
01:06:23,850 --> 01:06:24,910
Diamonds.

726
01:06:41,340 --> 01:06:43,270
Hey hey.

727
01:06:43,340 --> 01:06:46,070
Look I want you two
to stay up here and keep quiet.

728
01:06:46,140 --> 01:06:47,770
Shorty you keep an eye on her.

729
01:06:47,840 --> 01:06:49,110
Why where are you going?

730
01:06:49,180 --> 01:06:50,110
Down there.

731
01:06:50,180 --> 01:06:51,270
Down there?!

732
01:06:51,350 --> 01:06:52,780
Are you crazy?!

733
01:06:52,850 --> 01:06:56,110
I'm not leaving here
without the stones.

734
01:06:56,190 --> 01:06:57,280
You could get killed

735
01:06:57,350 --> 01:06:59,290
chasing after your damn
fortune and glory!

736
01:06:59,360 --> 01:07:01,080
Maybe.

737
01:07:01,160 --> 01:07:04,250
But not today.

738
01:08:19,540 --> 01:08:21,630
Be careful.

739
01:09:30,540 --> 01:09:33,270
Where's he going?

740
01:09:35,980 --> 01:09:38,280
Let me go...!

741
01:09:40,480 --> 01:09:44,390
Run Willie! Run!

742
01:11:16,780 --> 01:11:18,540
Dr. Jones!

743
01:11:20,250 --> 01:11:21,980
I keep telling you

744
01:11:22,050 --> 01:11:25,280
you listen me more
you live longer.

745
01:11:25,420 --> 01:11:28,410
Please let me die.

746
01:11:28,490 --> 01:11:30,760
I pray to Siva

747
01:11:30,830 --> 01:11:34,460
"Let me die" but I do not.

748
01:11:34,530 --> 01:11:37,520
Now... now the evil
of Kali take me.

749
01:11:39,240 --> 01:11:40,460
How?

750
01:11:40,540 --> 01:11:43,510
They will make me drink
the blood of the Kali.

751
01:11:43,570 --> 01:11:45,800
Then I'll fall
into the black sleep

752
01:11:45,880 --> 01:11:47,310
of the Kali Ma.

753
01:11:47,410 --> 01:11:48,600
What is that?

754
01:11:48,680 --> 01:11:51,080
We become like them.

755
01:11:52,850 --> 01:11:56,810
We'll be alive
but like a nightmare.

756
01:11:56,890 --> 01:12:00,950
You drink blood
you not wake up from nightmare.

757
01:12:12,170 --> 01:12:16,870
You were caught trying to steal
the Sankara Stones.

758
01:12:16,940 --> 01:12:19,930
There were five stones
in the beginning.

759
01:12:20,010 --> 01:12:23,380
Over the centuries they
were dispersed by wars

760
01:12:23,450 --> 01:12:25,440
sold off by thieves like you.

761
01:12:25,520 --> 01:12:27,610
Thieves like me huh?

762
01:12:27,680 --> 01:12:28,620
Ha!

763
01:12:28,680 --> 01:12:31,450
Still missing two.

764
01:12:31,520 --> 01:12:34,620
A century ago when the
British raided this temple

765
01:12:34,690 --> 01:12:36,280
and butchered my people

766
01:12:36,360 --> 01:12:38,790
a loyal priest hid
the last two stones

767
01:12:38,860 --> 01:12:40,450
down here in the catacombs.

768
01:12:40,530 --> 01:12:43,120
So that's what you've got
these slaves digging for huh?

769
01:12:43,200 --> 01:12:45,260
They're innocent children.

770
01:12:45,330 --> 01:12:48,130
They dig for the gems
to support our cause.

771
01:12:50,210 --> 01:12:55,010
They also search
for the last two stones.

772
01:12:55,080 --> 01:12:58,480
Soon we will have
all the five Sankara Stones

773
01:12:58,550 --> 01:13:02,450
and the Thuggees will be
all powerful.

774
01:13:02,520 --> 01:13:05,420
What a vivid imagination.

775
01:13:09,830 --> 01:13:11,760
You...

776
01:13:11,830 --> 01:13:14,190
don't believe me?

777
01:13:14,260 --> 01:13:18,500
You will Dr. Jones.

778
01:13:18,570 --> 01:13:21,770
You will become...

779
01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:24,100
a true believer.

780
01:13:40,860 --> 01:13:42,690
Hi.

781
01:14:07,320 --> 01:14:08,410
Dr. Jones!

782
01:14:08,480 --> 01:14:09,970
Don't drink... it's bad!

783
01:14:10,050 --> 01:14:12,040
Don't drink!

784
01:14:12,120 --> 01:14:13,550
Spit it out!

785
01:14:47,390 --> 01:14:48,360
Dr. Jones...

786
01:15:07,640 --> 01:15:11,910
You dare not do that.

787
01:15:28,700 --> 01:15:31,000
Leave him alone you bastards!

788
01:15:41,510 --> 01:15:43,840
The British in India
will be slaughtered.

789
01:15:43,910 --> 01:15:46,610
Then we will overrun
the Muslims.

790
01:15:46,680 --> 01:15:49,240
Then the Hebrew God will fall.

791
01:15:49,320 --> 01:15:50,880
And then the Christian God

792
01:15:50,950 --> 01:15:52,980
will be cast down and forgotten.

793
01:15:55,360 --> 01:15:58,420
Soon Kali Ma
will rule the world.

794
01:16:04,500 --> 01:16:06,490
Dr. Jones...

795
01:17:49,270 --> 01:17:52,300
Kali Ma protects us.

796
01:17:53,680 --> 01:17:55,440
We are her children.

797
01:17:55,510 --> 01:17:58,670
We pledge our devotion to her

798
01:17:58,750 --> 01:18:00,370
with an offering of flesh...

799
01:18:00,450 --> 01:18:02,580
What are you doing?!

800
01:18:04,690 --> 01:18:07,920
...and blood.

801
01:18:16,500 --> 01:18:22,060
Your friend has seen...
and she has heard.

802
01:18:22,140 --> 01:18:26,400
Now she will not talk.

803
01:18:34,080 --> 01:18:36,240
I'm not going to have
anything nice to say

804
01:18:36,390 --> 01:18:38,110
about this place
when I get back.

805
01:18:38,190 --> 01:18:41,160
Indy! For God sakes help me!

806
01:18:41,220 --> 01:18:44,120
Wh-What's the matter with you?

807
01:18:59,480 --> 01:19:02,000
No... no.

808
01:19:32,640 --> 01:19:34,270
Come.

809
01:19:36,950 --> 01:19:38,970
Come.

810
01:20:00,370 --> 01:20:02,130
Indiana...

811
01:20:04,010 --> 01:20:09,770
Indiana... help us.

812
01:20:21,360 --> 01:20:24,290
Please snap out of it.

813
01:20:24,390 --> 01:20:27,420
You're not one of them.

814
01:20:29,730 --> 01:20:33,070
You're not one of them.

815
01:20:34,600 --> 01:20:37,540
Please come back to us.

816
01:20:37,610 --> 01:20:40,440
Don't leave me.

817
01:20:53,060 --> 01:20:55,520
No!

818
01:20:57,830 --> 01:21:00,350
What are you doing?!

819
01:21:00,430 --> 01:21:02,020
Are you mad?!

820
01:22:16,970 --> 01:22:18,060
Oh...

821
01:22:18,140 --> 01:22:21,940
Oh this can't be happening
this can't be happening.

822
01:22:22,010 --> 01:22:25,140
Wake up Willie wake up.

823
01:22:56,180 --> 01:22:59,050
No! No! No...!

824
01:23:10,060 --> 01:23:10,990
No!

825
01:23:11,060 --> 01:23:12,960
No no no!

826
01:23:13,030 --> 01:23:16,960
Wake up Dr. Jones
wake up!

827
01:23:20,240 --> 01:23:21,570
Dr. Jones!

828
01:23:36,080 --> 01:23:39,080
Indy I love you.

829
01:23:40,060 --> 01:23:42,420
Wake up Indy!

830
01:23:42,490 --> 01:23:43,290
Wake up!

831
01:23:45,190 --> 01:23:47,060
You're my best friend!

832
01:23:47,130 --> 01:23:48,320
Wake up Indy!

833
01:23:53,270 --> 01:23:55,760
Wait! Wait!

834
01:23:55,840 --> 01:23:58,970
He's mine!

835
01:24:01,310 --> 01:24:03,280
I'm all right kid.

836
01:24:48,220 --> 01:24:49,520
Mola Ram!

837
01:26:11,340 --> 01:26:13,100
Give me some slack!

838
01:26:32,090 --> 01:26:35,120
Willie Willie wake up!

839
01:26:37,470 --> 01:26:39,830
Willie Willie it's me!
I'm back!

840
01:26:42,400 --> 01:26:44,430
Oh Indy.

841
01:27:11,770 --> 01:27:15,330
Indy... my friend.

842
01:27:15,400 --> 01:27:18,570
I'm sorry kid.

843
01:27:23,680 --> 01:27:24,800
Indy...

844
01:27:24,880 --> 01:27:28,080
now let's get out of here.

845
01:27:28,150 --> 01:27:32,590
Right. All of us.

846
01:28:45,630 --> 01:28:46,220
No!

847
01:29:03,710 --> 01:29:04,840
I've got to save him!

848
01:29:04,910 --> 01:29:06,400
He can take care of himself.

849
01:29:06,480 --> 01:29:07,410
He needs me.

850
01:29:09,650 --> 01:29:11,310
I've got to save Indy!

851
01:29:23,670 --> 01:29:25,130
Okay save him.

852
01:29:29,570 --> 01:29:30,900
Drop him down!

853
01:29:30,970 --> 01:29:32,440
I kill you!

854
01:29:32,510 --> 01:29:35,140
Drop him down!

855
01:29:37,980 --> 01:29:39,310
Whoa!

856
01:30:04,640 --> 01:30:06,200
What's the matter with him?

857
01:30:49,380 --> 01:30:51,350
Here. Try this.

858
01:32:06,460 --> 01:32:08,120
Go Indy!

859
01:33:10,530 --> 01:33:12,960
It was the Black Sleep of Kali.

860
01:33:26,170 --> 01:33:27,160
Short Round!

861
01:33:28,180 --> 01:33:30,010
Quit fooling around
with that kid!

862
01:33:30,080 --> 01:33:31,550
Get down in the cart now!

863
01:33:31,610 --> 01:33:33,270
Okeydokey Indy!

864
01:33:33,350 --> 01:33:34,470
Please listen.

865
01:33:34,550 --> 01:33:36,640
To get out
you must take the left tunnel.

866
01:33:36,720 --> 01:33:37,910
Thank you.

867
01:34:25,670 --> 01:34:26,600
Shorty!

868
01:34:26,670 --> 01:34:27,640
Quit stalling!

869
01:34:28,870 --> 01:34:29,860
Come on Indy!

870
01:34:29,940 --> 01:34:31,100
Go!

871
01:34:31,170 --> 01:34:32,730
Go! Go!

872
01:34:35,640 --> 01:34:36,910
Shorty look out!

873
01:34:46,720 --> 01:34:48,250
- Come on!
- Indy!

874
01:34:53,130 --> 01:34:53,990
Hurry!

875
01:34:59,370 --> 01:35:00,430
Hurry!

876
01:35:00,500 --> 01:35:01,330
Hurry up!

877
01:35:06,980 --> 01:35:08,570
Indy take the left tunnel!

878
01:35:08,640 --> 01:35:10,110
The left tunnel!

879
01:35:10,180 --> 01:35:11,440
No Indy!

880
01:35:11,510 --> 01:35:13,280
You missed it!
Left tunnel!

881
01:35:42,280 --> 01:35:45,940
We got company!

882
01:35:50,180 --> 01:35:51,120
Stop.

883
01:35:51,190 --> 01:35:51,950
Let her go!

884
01:35:52,020 --> 01:35:53,780
- Let go of the brake.
- What?

885
01:35:53,860 --> 01:35:54,950
What?

886
01:35:55,020 --> 01:35:57,290
Let her go. Our only chance
is to outrun them.

887
01:36:14,340 --> 01:36:15,430
- Shorty?
- Huh?

888
01:36:15,510 --> 01:36:17,100
Come up here
and take the brake.

889
01:36:18,310 --> 01:36:19,410
Watch it on the curves

890
01:36:19,480 --> 01:36:21,070
or we'll fly
right off the track.

891
01:36:21,150 --> 01:36:22,510
Okay.

892
01:37:18,470 --> 01:37:20,130
Yay!

893
01:37:43,770 --> 01:37:44,860
What are you doing?

894
01:37:44,930 --> 01:37:46,060
Short cut.

895
01:37:46,130 --> 01:37:47,660
- Yes Indy.
- Short cut.

896
01:38:11,630 --> 01:38:14,190
Watch it!

897
01:38:17,430 --> 01:38:18,660
Indy help!

898
01:38:21,970 --> 01:38:23,530
- Hang on!
- Indy!

899
01:38:24,440 --> 01:38:25,410
Pull him in.

900
01:38:25,470 --> 01:38:26,960
Let me go!
Let me go!

901
01:38:28,240 --> 01:38:29,470
Let go of him!

902
01:38:30,710 --> 01:38:32,480
No! No!

903
01:38:32,550 --> 01:38:34,380
Pull him in!

904
01:38:34,450 --> 01:38:35,540
- I'll catch him!
- No!

905
01:39:22,260 --> 01:39:23,160
Duck!

906
01:39:42,780 --> 01:39:43,880
All right.

907
01:39:43,950 --> 01:39:45,250
- What?
- Brakes. Brakes.

908
01:39:45,350 --> 01:39:47,120
Slow us down.

909
01:39:47,190 --> 01:39:48,310
Okay.

910
01:39:52,230 --> 01:39:53,780
Uh-oh. Big mistake.

911
01:39:53,860 --> 01:39:55,060
Big mistake Indy.

912
01:39:55,130 --> 01:39:56,890
Figures.

913
01:40:18,150 --> 01:40:19,680
We're going too fast!

914
01:40:19,750 --> 01:40:20,850
Too fast!

915
01:40:20,920 --> 01:40:22,510
We're going to crash!

916
01:40:34,500 --> 01:40:36,630
Water water water!

917
01:40:36,700 --> 01:40:38,300
Oh look!
Look there!

918
01:40:38,410 --> 01:40:40,170
- Water!
- Fire! You're on fire!

919
01:40:40,240 --> 01:40:41,170
Water water!

920
01:40:41,240 --> 01:40:42,170
Look...

921
01:40:42,240 --> 01:40:43,210
Water water.

922
01:40:45,310 --> 01:40:47,250
Water water.

923
01:40:47,320 --> 01:40:49,810
Come on...
Come on!

924
01:41:03,100 --> 01:41:04,460
Let's go!

925
01:41:08,400 --> 01:41:09,730
Run run!

926
01:41:22,450 --> 01:41:24,580
Willie look out!

927
01:41:34,200 --> 01:41:35,290
No!

928
01:41:35,430 --> 01:41:37,760
Head for the bridge. Go!

929
01:41:40,100 --> 01:41:41,360
Come on Willie this way.

930
01:41:54,420 --> 01:41:55,610
Oh God.

931
01:41:55,680 --> 01:41:57,410
Come on let's go.

932
01:41:57,490 --> 01:41:58,580
Strong bridge.

933
01:41:58,650 --> 01:41:59,950
Come on let's go.

934
01:42:00,020 --> 01:42:01,080
Strong bridge.

935
01:42:01,160 --> 01:42:03,820
Look... strong wood.

936
01:42:03,890 --> 01:42:05,360
Come on!

937
01:42:05,430 --> 01:42:06,090
Look!

938
01:42:06,890 --> 01:42:07,990
Shorty!

939
01:42:11,100 --> 01:42:12,030
Help!

940
01:42:12,100 --> 01:42:13,090
I'm falling down.

941
01:42:14,900 --> 01:42:17,130
Help!

942
01:42:18,510 --> 01:42:20,470
Not very funny.

943
01:42:45,300 --> 01:42:46,660
Back!

944
01:43:12,460 --> 01:43:15,260
Welcome.

945
01:43:24,870 --> 01:43:26,070
Ow!

946
01:43:26,140 --> 01:43:29,230
Let her go Mola Ram.

947
01:43:29,310 --> 01:43:31,740
You are in a position
unsuitable

948
01:43:31,810 --> 01:43:33,640
to give orders.

949
01:43:33,710 --> 01:43:34,980
Watch your back!

950
01:43:42,590 --> 01:43:45,860
You want the stones
let 'em go.

951
01:43:50,430 --> 01:43:51,830
Let her go!

952
01:43:53,670 --> 01:43:55,830
Drop them Dr. Jones.

953
01:43:55,900 --> 01:43:58,030
They will be found.

954
01:43:58,110 --> 01:44:00,510
You won't.

955
01:44:03,080 --> 01:44:04,840
Indy!

956
01:44:04,910 --> 01:44:07,380
Behind you!

957
01:44:14,660 --> 01:44:17,150
Oh shit.

958
01:44:27,100 --> 01:44:29,070
Go on.

959
01:44:29,140 --> 01:44:31,970
Go.

960
01:44:41,250 --> 01:44:43,550
Go on!
Go on!

961
01:44:43,620 --> 01:44:46,090
That way.

962
01:44:49,090 --> 01:44:51,350
Shorty...

963
01:44:56,900 --> 01:44:57,860
Hang on lady.

964
01:44:57,930 --> 01:44:59,420
We going for a ride.

965
01:45:00,940 --> 01:45:03,100
Oh my God!

966
01:45:04,110 --> 01:45:06,600
Oh my God.
Oh my God!

967
01:45:06,670 --> 01:45:08,400
Oh my God!

968
01:45:08,480 --> 01:45:10,440
Is he nuts?

969
01:45:10,510 --> 01:45:12,810
He no nuts.

970
01:45:12,880 --> 01:45:14,710
He's crazy.

971
01:45:14,780 --> 01:45:19,240
Mola Ram
prepare to meet Kali...

972
01:45:19,390 --> 01:45:21,620
in hell.

973
01:45:22,490 --> 01:45:23,620
What are you doing?!

974
01:45:23,690 --> 01:45:24,750
You fool!

975
01:46:25,720 --> 01:46:27,450
Indy cover your heart!

976
01:46:27,520 --> 01:46:30,010
Cover your heart!

977
01:46:30,090 --> 01:46:31,890
Oh my God!

978
01:46:41,800 --> 01:46:43,060
Oh my God.

979
01:47:26,180 --> 01:47:27,510
- Look out!
- No!

980
01:47:53,540 --> 01:47:54,600
No!

981
01:47:58,350 --> 01:48:01,140
Hurry! Let's go!

982
01:48:01,220 --> 01:48:03,710
The stones are mine!

983
01:48:03,780 --> 01:48:06,690
You've betrayed Siva.

984
01:48:10,960 --> 01:48:12,520
You betrayed Siva.

985
01:48:21,700 --> 01:48:23,230
You betrayed Siva!

986
01:48:55,440 --> 01:48:57,200
Well it's about time.

987
01:49:15,020 --> 01:49:17,120
Hold your fire.

988
01:51:18,750 --> 01:51:21,940
We know you are coming back

989
01:51:22,020 --> 01:51:24,980
when life return to our village.

990
01:51:28,590 --> 01:51:35,790
Now you can see the magic
of the rock you bring back.

991
01:51:35,860 --> 01:51:39,960
Yes I understand its power now.

992
01:51:45,170 --> 01:51:46,830
You could've kept it.

993
01:51:46,910 --> 01:51:48,100
Ah what for?

994
01:51:48,180 --> 01:51:49,640
They'd just put it in a museum.

995
01:51:49,710 --> 01:51:51,540
It'd be another rock
collecting dust.

996
01:51:51,610 --> 01:51:54,550
But then it would've given you
your fortune and glory.

997
01:51:54,620 --> 01:51:56,550
Anything could happen.

998
01:51:56,620 --> 01:51:58,410
It's a long way to Delhi.

999
01:51:58,490 --> 01:52:00,110
No thanks.

1000
01:52:00,190 --> 01:52:02,680
No more adventures
with you Dr. Jones.

1001
01:52:02,760 --> 01:52:06,390
Sweetheart after all the fun
we've had together?

1002
01:52:06,460 --> 01:52:09,990
If you think I'm going to Delhi
with you or anyplace else

1003
01:52:10,060 --> 01:52:10,230
after all the trouble
you've gotten me into

1004
01:52:10,230 --> 01:52:12,530
after all the trouble
you've gotten me into

1005
01:52:12,600 --> 01:52:14,260
think again buster!

1006
01:52:14,330 --> 01:52:16,890
I'm going home to Missouri where
they never feed you snakes

1007
01:52:16,970 --> 01:52:19,730
before ripping your heart out
and lowering you into hot pits!

1008
01:52:19,810 --> 01:52:23,260
This is not my idea
of a swell time!

1009
01:52:23,410 --> 01:52:24,710
Excuse me sir.

1010
01:52:24,780 --> 01:52:26,250
I need a guide to Delhi.
If you could...

1011
01:52:40,690 --> 01:52:42,590
Oh...

1012
01:52:46,100 --> 01:52:48,360
Very funny.

1013
01:52:53,910 --> 01:52:55,370
Very funny.

1014
01:52:58,780 --> 01:52:59,970
Uh-oh.

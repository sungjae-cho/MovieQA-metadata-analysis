1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,074


2
00:02:47,708 --> 00:02:50,246
This is great.

3
00:02:50,461 --> 00:02:55,040
That's incredible. There's got to
be seven or eight feet up there.

4
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:59,042
- And eighty years of dust.
- Look at all this height.

5
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:02,428
We could put our bedroom upstairs,
and get all this space.

6
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,012
- For what?
- Just space.

7
00:03:06,394 --> 00:03:07,971
One.

8
00:03:08,187 --> 00:03:09,598
Two.

9
00:03:09,814 --> 00:03:11,273
Three.

10
00:03:12,733 --> 00:03:15,438
- And four?
- Come on.

11
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:17,987
And five?

12
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:24,068
- Watch, watch.
- God, this place is huge.

13
00:03:26,831 --> 00:03:29,832
- It's beautiful.
- God.

14
00:03:30,042 --> 00:03:33,577
- You guys, it's absolutely incredible.
- Incredible.

15
00:03:34,672 --> 00:03:38,373
- A little paint.
- Sell it tomorrow, double your money.

16
00:03:38,593 --> 00:03:41,048
Carl, you're obsessed.

17
00:03:41,262 --> 00:03:42,721
A little bit.

18
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:44,389
Look.

19
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:48,593
Hey, it's an Indian Head penny.

20
00:03:48,811 --> 00:03:50,270
1898.

21
00:03:53,191 --> 00:03:55,230
It's a good omen.

22
00:03:55,943 --> 00:03:58,066
You're the good omen.

23
00:04:01,866 --> 00:04:03,859
It's so great.

24
00:04:13,085 --> 00:04:17,166
I had Rose move your 3 o'clock
with Bob Kahan to 4 o'clock.

25
00:04:17,381 --> 00:04:22,423
Gary Alan called. He has to see you
about the painting bids for the loft.

26
00:04:22,637 --> 00:04:25,840
3 o'clock is the only time
he can make it. Is that OK?

27
00:04:26,057 --> 00:04:27,551
Sam?

28
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:32,517
- I'm sorry.
- Relax, man.

29
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:34,972
You're not having brain surgery.

30
00:04:35,191 --> 00:04:38,774
Pitching these Japanese guys
makes me so nervous.

31
00:04:38,986 --> 00:04:42,106
Sam, you're going to be great. OK?

32
00:04:43,032 --> 00:04:48,572
What am I supposed to say? I can't
really tell them my Swedish girl joke.

33
00:04:49,205 --> 00:04:51,696
Great. Where did you get those?

34
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:54,489
Molly. What do you think?
Are they me?

35
00:04:55,211 --> 00:04:58,165
Man! Look at that, a Testarossa.

36
00:04:58,381 --> 00:05:00,954
Pay off your Mustang first.

37
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:14,017
How are you?
What did the doctor say?

38
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:17,266
He said that it was contagious.
That it was really...

39
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:18,894
- No?
- Yeah.

40
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:21,565
I shouldn't even be coming in today.

41
00:05:22,864 --> 00:05:24,903
What about the rash?

42
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:27,033
The rash?

43
00:05:27,243 --> 00:05:30,327
The rash is also incredibly contagious.

44
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:33,823
- He said they've both been spreading.
- No?

45
00:05:37,545 --> 00:05:39,538
On your genitals again?

46
00:05:39,755 --> 00:05:42,875
Yeah, yeah, right on the genitals.

47
00:05:43,092 --> 00:05:46,924
Basically everywhere.
He said that I shouldn't touch anyone.

48
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:49,799
Excuse me, I'm sorry.

49
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:55,014
- You're sick.
- I know.

50
00:05:55,229 --> 00:05:56,937
- Morning, Paul.
- Morning, Carl.

51
00:05:57,148 --> 00:05:59,057
Save it, Paul.

52
00:05:59,567 --> 00:06:01,892
- Morning, Mr. Wheat.
- Susie. You're looking good.

53
00:06:02,111 --> 00:06:04,519
- Sam.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

54
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:09,573
- Here it is.
- Thanks.

55
00:06:11,746 --> 00:06:13,323
- Morning, Sam.
- Morning, Rose.

56
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:16,789
- Listen, the Kobiashi people...
- They're already here.

57
00:06:17,001 --> 00:06:18,792
- They're early.
- I know.

58
00:06:19,003 --> 00:06:21,494
- Come here.
- Andy Dillon called...

59
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:23,837
- How long have they been here?
- Ten minutes.

60
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:28,213
Andy Dillon called. He needs $900,000
transferred to Albany by ten.

61
00:06:28,429 --> 00:06:30,469
- By ten?
- Yes.

62
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:35,098
- Carl?
- Yeah.

63
00:06:36,187 --> 00:06:38,226
Carl...

64
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:42,733
Dillon needs 900,000 in Albany by ten.
Can you transfer it to his account?

65
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:45,779
- Yes, but I need your MAC code.
- OK.

66
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:54,826
- Discretion, right?
- Got it.

67
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:57,874
- You bet. I'll do it right now.
- Thanks.

68
00:06:58,084 --> 00:06:59,792
Bill, I'll call you back.

69
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:12,055
OK, that's fine.

70
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:13,640
That's fine.

71
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:17,261
This is too far out.

72
00:07:18,896 --> 00:07:20,474
Can you get this, man?

73
00:07:22,066 --> 00:07:25,020
Are you guys from
the New York City Ballet?

74
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:30,860
Almost...

75
00:07:35,454 --> 00:07:37,447
- Saved your life.
- You shit.

76
00:07:37,665 --> 00:07:39,823
Why do you scare me to death?

77
00:07:40,042 --> 00:07:44,336
It's better than seeing this gorgeous
body splattered all over the place.

78
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:46,207
Look out.

79
00:07:51,512 --> 00:07:54,383
- Grab it.
- Sam, Moll. Are you guy's home?

80
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:56,425
- Did you invite Carl?
- Slave labor.

81
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:58,635
- Carl.
- Hurry, help.

82
00:07:58,853 --> 00:08:01,391
- Oh, my God.
- Grab the bottom.

83
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:03,479
- Now, go there.
- Here?

84
00:08:04,775 --> 00:08:07,527
- Right here?
- Watch your toes.

85
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,949
- Where do you want this?
- In the bedroom.

86
00:08:13,701 --> 00:08:17,865
- God, this place looks great.
- You like it?

87
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:22,873
Like is hardly the word. I had no idea
it would be this beautiful. It's incredible.

88
00:08:23,085 --> 00:08:27,379
- What about her?
- Leave her until the other stuff is here.

89
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:30,211
- What are these?
- Let me show you.

90
00:08:30,426 --> 00:08:33,297
Will you help me lift this up?

91
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:38,767
- Just finished it. What do you think?
- I love it.

92
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:43,142
Sam, what's this chair doing here?

93
00:08:43,815 --> 00:08:47,729
- I love that chair.
- I know, but we discussed this.

94
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:49,983
I've had it forever.

95
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:54,276
- When I watch TV, I sit in it.
- This chair is ugly.

96
00:08:54,492 --> 00:08:57,825
- And it doesn't go with anything.
- It goes with me.

97
00:08:58,704 --> 00:09:00,744
You're right, it does.

98
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:04,544
- We'll paint it.
- We'll what?

99
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:16,128
Are you OK?

100
00:09:16,347 --> 00:09:18,174
I'm fine.

101
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:23,683
What's the matter?

102
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:25,390
Nothing.

103
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:31,855
Are you worried about the promotion?

104
00:09:33,447 --> 00:09:35,487
No, not really.

105
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:47,287
Then what - moving in together?

106
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:49,582
No.

107
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:56,463
I don't know.
It's a lot of things.

108
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,971
I just don't want the bubble to burst.

109
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:08,063
It seems like...

110
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:15,066
...whenever anything good in my life
happens, I'm afraid I'm going to lose it.

111
00:10:20,369 --> 00:10:22,113
I love you.

112
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:25,162
I really love you.

113
00:10:27,835 --> 00:10:29,164
Ditto.

114
00:10:32,548 --> 00:10:38,005
The pilot's first report of trouble was
he blew the number two engine...

115
00:10:39,597 --> 00:10:42,005
Oh, Jesus.
Another one?

116
00:10:44,268 --> 00:10:46,178
Don't watch that.

117
00:10:47,438 --> 00:10:51,566
I should cancel my LA trip.
These things always happen in threes.

118
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:54,777
Sam, get serious.

119
00:10:55,238 --> 00:10:59,449
- Besides, you lead a charmed life.
- Yeah, so did they.

120
00:11:01,452 --> 00:11:04,157
It's amazing.
Just like that...

121
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:05,996
Blackout.

122
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:15,060
What are you doing?

123
00:12:16,319 --> 00:12:18,561
I couldn't sleep.

124
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,697
Boy...

125
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:24,985
I really must have passed out.

126
00:12:25,203 --> 00:12:28,737
- What time is it?
- It's 2 a.m.

127
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:54,147
Oh, no.

128
00:12:54,357 --> 00:12:56,895
I hope it wasn't a masterpiece.

129
00:12:57,109 --> 00:12:58,901
Well, it's not now.

130
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:03,112
- Can I help?
- Yeah.

131
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:05,696
Put your hands here...
Now get them wet.

132
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:11,949
Let the clay slide between your fingers.

133
00:16:05,756 --> 00:16:07,381
Oh, no.

134
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:12,674
- What's the matter?
- A glitch. What's up?

135
00:16:12,889 --> 00:16:16,721
The Greenberg and White accounts,
I can't get in. The macro doesn't work.

136
00:16:16,934 --> 00:16:19,306
- I changed it.
- Why?

137
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:23,435
- I just want to nose around a bit.
- Is something wrong?

138
00:16:24,734 --> 00:16:26,561
Can you keep a secret?

139
00:16:28,738 --> 00:16:31,608
Yeah, sure. What's up?

140
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:34,993
There's too much money
in these accounts.

141
00:16:35,203 --> 00:16:37,242
That's impossible.

142
00:16:42,126 --> 00:16:45,744
Sam, this is going to take you hours.
Let me do this.

143
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:49,083
- It already has taken me hours.
- Let me figure it out for you.

144
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:52,550
No, it's OK.
It's like a vendetta now.

145
00:16:53,888 --> 00:16:55,927
Thanks, though, I appreciate it.

146
00:16:56,766 --> 00:17:00,466
- If you start to go blind, give a shout.
- OK. Adios.

147
00:17:01,646 --> 00:17:04,765
Listen, what are you and Moll
doing tonight?

148
00:17:04,982 --> 00:17:08,149
We're going to the theatre.
She wants to see Macbeth.

149
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:10,816
I think she likes the guys in tights.

150
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:14,280
- You want to go?
- No. I want a full report, though.

151
00:17:15,076 --> 00:17:16,618
- Later.
- Yeah.

152
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:26,118
Well, I loved it.
I was spellbound the whole time.

153
00:17:26,337 --> 00:17:31,497
I could tell, and so could the rest of
the audience, with that snore of yours.

154
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:41,098
- Did I tell you what Marcia said?
- About six times.

155
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:45,474
It wasn't six times.
Quit being so blasé about this.

156
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:49,189
This was really important. I'm going
to have two pieces in her gallery.

157
00:17:49,402 --> 00:17:52,937
The New York Times
reviews her gallery all the time.

158
00:17:53,156 --> 00:17:57,200
The New York Times is a frustrated
critic with pimples on his ass...

159
00:17:57,410 --> 00:18:01,277
who flunked art school.
Who cares what they think?

160
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:04,036
About 8 million readers, that's who.

161
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:07,868
No, they're just reading
the sports page.

162
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:11,290
Your work is really beautiful.
It really is.

163
00:18:12,425 --> 00:18:16,588
It shouldn't matter what anyone else
thinks, just what I think.

164
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:24,596
- I want to marry you, Sam.
- What?

165
00:18:26,814 --> 00:18:31,026
- What?
- Yeah, I've been thinking about it.

166
00:18:31,986 --> 00:18:34,655
I've been thinking about it a lot.

167
00:18:34,864 --> 00:18:37,272
I think we should just do it.

168
00:18:37,492 --> 00:18:40,825
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

169
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:47,328
What's that look for?

170
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:54,048
You never wanted to talk about it.

171
00:19:03,726 --> 00:19:08,803
- Do you love me, Sam?
- What do you think?

172
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:13,150
- Why don't you ever say it?
- What do you mean?

173
00:19:13,361 --> 00:19:18,355
- I say it all the time.
- You say "ditto." That's not the same.

174
00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:25,411
People say "I love you" all the time,
and it doesn't mean anything.

175
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:32,039
Sometimes you need to hear it.

176
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:35,081
I need to hear it.

177
00:19:35,925 --> 00:19:37,716
Let's go.

178
00:19:46,144 --> 00:19:48,717
- What should we do?
- Let me handle it.

179
00:19:48,938 --> 00:19:52,022
- What do you want?
- Your wallet.

180
00:19:52,233 --> 00:19:55,068
Sam, just give it to him.

181
00:19:56,529 --> 00:19:59,613
Just take the money. Just leave...

182
00:19:59,824 --> 00:20:01,448
No. Sam.

183
00:20:01,659 --> 00:20:03,735
You son of a bitch.

184
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:11,495
Somebody help us.

185
00:20:15,756 --> 00:20:18,793
Somebody. Somebody help us.

186
00:20:22,138 --> 00:20:24,676
Stop it, Sam.

187
00:20:45,912 --> 00:20:47,406
Molly?

188
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:51,580
Molly. You got...?

189
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:09,016
Baby, hold on.
You're going to be OK.

190
00:21:10,019 --> 00:21:12,973
Somebody? Somebody.

191
00:21:13,189 --> 00:21:16,024
Somebody help us.

192
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:23,277
Oh, my God.
Sam, come on. Come on, baby.

193
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:29,611
You're going to be OK.

194
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:41,382
Somebody? Somebody help me.

195
00:21:42,885 --> 00:21:45,423
Please, anybody.

196
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:49,845
OK, lady, take it easy.

197
00:21:50,059 --> 00:21:51,933
We'll help you.

198
00:21:52,145 --> 00:21:54,267
Molly? Molly?

199
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,809
Molly.

200
00:22:03,072 --> 00:22:05,610
What shall we do?

201
00:22:14,959 --> 00:22:17,532
What's happening? What's...

202
00:22:19,088 --> 00:22:21,460
Is he breathing?

203
00:22:27,763 --> 00:22:30,052
Oh, goddamn, hold on.

204
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:55,120
Here we go.

205
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:04,211
Sam, don't you leave me. Hold on.

206
00:23:57,395 --> 00:24:00,182
If you would just step this way.

207
00:24:17,206 --> 00:24:21,500
- So, what happened to you?
- What?

208
00:24:21,711 --> 00:24:23,869
You're new? I can tell.

209
00:24:24,088 --> 00:24:27,872
- Are you talking to me?
- Relax, it ain't like before.

210
00:24:28,092 --> 00:24:30,548
It's a whole new ball of wax.

211
00:24:30,761 --> 00:24:33,846
- Who are you?
- I'm waiting for my wife.

212
00:24:34,056 --> 00:24:37,556
She's in the cardiac wing.
She's fighting it.

213
00:24:46,861 --> 00:24:49,566
Shot? That'll do it every time.

214
00:24:51,157 --> 00:24:53,066
Poor bastard.

215
00:24:53,284 --> 00:24:57,412
You may as well get used to it -
you could be here for a long while.

216
00:25:01,876 --> 00:25:06,123
I'll tell you a secret.
Doors ain't as bad as you think.

217
00:25:06,339 --> 00:25:10,716
Zip-zap - ain't nothing at all.
You'll see. You'll catch on.

218
00:25:15,056 --> 00:25:19,718
He ain't going to make it. I've seen it
a million times - he's a goner.

219
00:25:25,358 --> 00:25:28,442
You see? Here they come.

220
00:25:32,031 --> 00:25:36,159
Lucky bastard.
It could have been the other ones.

221
00:25:36,369 --> 00:25:38,942
You never know.

222
00:25:59,433 --> 00:26:01,473
Who are they?

223
00:26:05,898 --> 00:26:07,476
No.

224
00:26:15,324 --> 00:26:17,447
God help me.

225
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:21,739
Help me.

226
00:26:27,503 --> 00:26:32,498
"I am sunk in the abysmal swamp
where there is no foothold.

227
00:26:32,717 --> 00:26:38,470
"I have reached the watery depths.
The flood overwhelms me.

228
00:26:38,681 --> 00:26:41,801
"I am wearied with calling."

229
00:26:42,018 --> 00:26:46,229
As we say farewell to our friend,
Sam Wheat,

230
00:26:46,439 --> 00:26:49,356
we are reminded of his kindness,

231
00:26:49,567 --> 00:26:51,975
his generosity,

232
00:26:52,195 --> 00:26:55,361
his buoyancy of spirit.

233
00:26:55,573 --> 00:26:57,649
All that we treasure,

234
00:26:57,867 --> 00:27:01,865
our loved ones,
our friends, our body...

235
00:27:03,289 --> 00:27:05,447
...our mind,

236
00:27:05,666 --> 00:27:11,253
are but on loan to us.
We must surrender them all.

237
00:27:11,464 --> 00:27:16,755
We are all travelers on the same road,
which leads to the same end.

238
00:27:20,348 --> 00:27:23,432
As our loved one enters eternal life,

239
00:27:23,643 --> 00:27:27,225
let us remember
that love, too, is eternal.

240
00:27:28,689 --> 00:27:32,983
That although we will miss him,
our love will light the void...

241
00:27:33,194 --> 00:27:35,649
and dispel the darkness.

242
00:28:14,819 --> 00:28:17,654
I picked up your shirts today.

243
00:28:19,073 --> 00:28:21,445
I don't know why.

244
00:28:25,079 --> 00:28:28,033
Mr. Reynolds told me to tell you "hello.'

245
00:28:31,377 --> 00:28:33,833
I broke into tears.

246
00:28:36,465 --> 00:28:39,716
It's like I think about you every minute.

247
00:28:39,927 --> 00:28:43,012
It's like I can still feel you.

248
00:28:52,648 --> 00:28:55,519
I'm here, Moll.

249
00:29:03,117 --> 00:29:05,157
What's the matter, kitty?

250
00:29:05,369 --> 00:29:08,157
What's the matter?

251
00:29:08,372 --> 00:29:11,077
Crazy cat.

252
00:29:14,170 --> 00:29:15,664
Sam?

253
00:29:18,299 --> 00:29:20,422
It's really stupid.

254
00:29:31,771 --> 00:29:33,810
I love this picture.

255
00:29:34,023 --> 00:29:36,063
It's great. Office.

256
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:48,200
Let me see that.

257
00:29:48,412 --> 00:29:50,738
Sam's address book.

258
00:29:57,672 --> 00:30:01,586
- Dave Brubeck, should I toss them?
- No.

259
00:30:01,801 --> 00:30:05,004
No? Molly, we hated that concert.

260
00:30:07,265 --> 00:30:09,637
You wanted to save those?

261
00:30:09,851 --> 00:30:13,136
Rolaids? Molly, what are you doing?

262
00:30:21,821 --> 00:30:24,228
I just miss him, Carl.

263
00:30:25,491 --> 00:30:27,567
Me, too.

264
00:30:29,954 --> 00:30:32,741
Carl? Wait a minute.

265
00:30:34,125 --> 00:30:36,414
Not that one.

266
00:30:36,627 --> 00:30:40,577
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to put that on there.

267
00:30:40,798 --> 00:30:43,918
Hey, Moll. Why don't you come?

268
00:30:44,135 --> 00:30:48,346
- It's like summer outside.
- No. I'm really not up for it.

269
00:30:48,556 --> 00:30:51,889
- It would be good for you to get out.
- I don't want to.

270
00:30:52,101 --> 00:30:55,185
You can't stay in here all day.
It's not healthy.

271
00:30:55,396 --> 00:30:57,436
I can't do it.

272
00:30:57,648 --> 00:31:00,602
You're not the one who died.

273
00:31:04,071 --> 00:31:07,238
- I'm sorry.
- Don't apologize.

274
00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:09,359
Shit.

275
00:31:12,705 --> 00:31:17,747
- Maybe you're right. Just a short one.
- That a girl.

276
00:31:21,255 --> 00:31:22,880
I'm sorry.

277
00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:24,834
Molly?

278
00:32:25,903 --> 00:32:28,359
What are you doing here?

279
00:32:28,573 --> 00:32:31,028
You bastard.

280
00:32:32,577 --> 00:32:35,032
You son of a bitch.

281
00:32:51,387 --> 00:32:53,843
What do you want?

282
00:32:54,682 --> 00:32:56,260
Molly?

283
00:32:57,393 --> 00:33:00,264
Molly, get out.

284
00:33:05,693 --> 00:33:07,733
No, Molly.

285
00:33:07,945 --> 00:33:09,985
No, please?

286
00:33:11,824 --> 00:33:13,900
He's got a gun, Molly.

287
00:33:14,118 --> 00:33:16,158
Hi, kitty.

288
00:33:17,079 --> 00:33:19,072
You hurt her, I'll...

289
00:33:45,566 --> 00:33:47,310
Shit.

290
00:33:49,570 --> 00:33:52,240
Is somebody there?

291
00:33:54,659 --> 00:33:56,153
Hello?

292
00:35:14,113 --> 00:35:16,900
Let go. What are you doing?

293
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:23,160
Like trains?

294
00:35:34,091 --> 00:35:36,879
Stay out. This is mine.

295
00:36:53,588 --> 00:36:55,331
Shit.

296
00:37:06,017 --> 00:37:08,686
It's me. I couldn't get it.

297
00:37:08,895 --> 00:37:10,934
She came home.

298
00:37:11,147 --> 00:37:13,982
Give me a couple of days. I'll go back.

299
00:37:14,192 --> 00:37:17,146
Relax. I'll get it.

300
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:21,486
Get what?

301
00:37:23,409 --> 00:37:27,158
Who are you?
What do you want from us?

302
00:37:31,918 --> 00:37:35,500
No. You stay away from her.

303
00:37:37,048 --> 00:37:39,087
Do you hear me?

304
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:41,791
You stay away from her.

305
00:38:43,781 --> 00:38:46,189
Rosa Santiago?

306
00:38:51,622 --> 00:38:53,532
Please be seated.

307
00:39:09,015 --> 00:39:11,257
Our sister will be with us soon.

308
00:39:14,937 --> 00:39:16,930
Sister Oda Mae,

309
00:39:17,148 --> 00:39:20,683
grant us the gift
of your all-seeing presence.

310
00:39:20,902 --> 00:39:23,606
Appear before us now.

311
00:39:28,910 --> 00:39:30,570
Mrs. Santiago?

312
00:39:31,913 --> 00:39:35,032
- Buenos días.
- I'm Oda Mae Brown.

313
00:39:35,249 --> 00:39:40,042
You wish to contact your husband.
I believe he'll be with us today.

314
00:39:40,254 --> 00:39:42,294
Thank you.

315
00:39:42,507 --> 00:39:45,591
But you know, Mrs. Santiago,

316
00:39:45,801 --> 00:39:48,886
there's no telling
about that other world,

317
00:39:49,096 --> 00:39:53,094
so you've got to be a believer.
Are you a believer?

318
00:39:53,309 --> 00:39:56,595
Sí, I believe, I believe.

319
00:39:56,813 --> 00:39:59,482
Then let us begin.

320
00:40:20,336 --> 00:40:21,711
I can't.

321
00:40:21,921 --> 00:40:24,163
It's too difficult.

322
00:40:24,382 --> 00:40:29,091
I just can't seem to make contact.
No - wait.

323
00:40:29,303 --> 00:40:32,090
I'm feeling something.

324
00:40:32,390 --> 00:40:36,553
Did he know someone
by the name of Anna?

325
00:40:38,271 --> 00:40:40,940
Consuelo?

326
00:40:41,149 --> 00:40:43,355
Lucita? Julietta?

327
00:40:43,568 --> 00:40:45,940
Josephina? Linda? Maria?

328
00:40:46,779 --> 00:40:50,362
Sí, sí. His Mama, she is Maria.

329
00:40:50,575 --> 00:40:54,619
Yes. Praise God.
I knew he was with his Mama.

330
00:40:54,829 --> 00:40:56,537
Oh, my God...

331
00:41:02,670 --> 00:41:06,999
It's too difficult. It's two of them -
I'm not sure I can do that.

332
00:41:07,216 --> 00:41:10,003
I pay more. How much?

333
00:41:10,219 --> 00:41:12,544
- How much?
- Twenty dollars.

334
00:41:12,763 --> 00:41:16,014
Way to go. Milk her for every penny.

335
00:41:32,825 --> 00:41:36,241
Yes. I believe we can start again.

336
00:41:50,843 --> 00:41:53,880
Praise the Lord. Thank you, Jesus.

337
00:42:10,947 --> 00:42:16,072
Welcome, Mrs. Santiago. You are
fortunate, the spirits are churning.

338
00:42:16,285 --> 00:42:18,574
- My husband?
- Mercy.

339
00:42:18,788 --> 00:42:21,243
Yeah, where?

340
00:42:23,292 --> 00:42:25,748
- Julio?
- Yes.

341
00:42:26,963 --> 00:42:29,632
I feel his vibration.

342
00:42:32,844 --> 00:42:35,880
- I see him.
- How is he? How does he look?

343
00:42:36,097 --> 00:42:38,255
He's a handsome man.

344
00:42:40,268 --> 00:42:42,011
Handsome?

345
00:42:42,228 --> 00:42:46,522
Mrs. Santiago, in our Father's
Kingdom, we're all handsome.

346
00:42:46,732 --> 00:42:49,223
Julio.

347
00:42:49,443 --> 00:42:53,690
Julio is coming towards us.
I see him. He's coming.

348
00:42:54,615 --> 00:42:56,655
He's there.

349
00:42:59,078 --> 00:43:02,613
He's dressed in a black suit.

350
00:43:03,249 --> 00:43:06,120
Black suit?

351
00:43:06,335 --> 00:43:10,167
- Could be blue.
- What a crock of shit.

352
00:43:10,381 --> 00:43:12,587
Who is that?

353
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:14,793
Where are you?

354
00:43:15,011 --> 00:43:17,169
Did you hear it?

355
00:43:17,388 --> 00:43:19,297
Where are you?

356
00:43:19,515 --> 00:43:21,508
- Who are you?
- Who?

357
00:43:23,102 --> 00:43:26,103
- You can hear me?
- Can't you hear him?

358
00:43:26,314 --> 00:43:30,892
I don't believe this. My name
is Sam Wheat. Can you hear me?

359
00:43:31,110 --> 00:43:34,277
- Say my name, "Sam Wheat.'
- Leave me alone.

360
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:40,108
- Talk to me, Oda Mae.
- Sam Wheat.

361
00:43:42,580 --> 00:43:45,581
- Jesus....
- Sam Wheat?

362
00:43:45,791 --> 00:43:50,786
I swear, no more cheating. I'll do
anything, just make that guy go away.

363
00:43:51,005 --> 00:43:53,045
No way.

364
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:02,679
It's OK.

365
00:44:06,813 --> 00:44:11,640
- All right, sister?
- Yeah, you're all right.

366
00:44:11,859 --> 00:44:16,071
My mother had it, and her mother.
They both had the gift.

367
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:20,741
They always said I had it,
but I never did, I never had it.

368
00:44:20,952 --> 00:44:25,910
They told me all about it, but now that
I've got it, I don't think I want it.

369
00:44:26,123 --> 00:44:28,697
Just go away. Find somebody else.

370
00:44:28,918 --> 00:44:31,872
- You're out of your mind.
- I'm getting there fast.

371
00:44:32,088 --> 00:44:34,127
She hit her head hard.

372
00:44:34,340 --> 00:44:37,045
She was talking to somebody
before that.

373
00:44:37,260 --> 00:44:39,133
Sister can do that.

374
00:44:39,387 --> 00:44:42,637
- Where exactly are you?
- Standing right beside you.

375
00:44:42,849 --> 00:44:47,392
- You're standing right beside me?
- Honey, we're right here.

376
00:44:47,603 --> 00:44:49,929
- Are you white?
- What?

377
00:44:50,148 --> 00:44:52,639
- White?
- You're white, aren't you?

378
00:44:52,859 --> 00:44:55,776
- You know what?
- I'm calling the doctor.

379
00:44:55,987 --> 00:45:00,898
- I knew it, a white guy. Why me?
- You're going to help me.

380
00:45:01,117 --> 00:45:05,862
There's a woman who is in terrible
danger. The man who killed me...

381
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:10,244
is going back to our apartment.
You've got to warn her.

382
00:45:10,459 --> 00:45:14,956
- Why would she listen to me?
- It's just a phone call.

383
00:45:17,175 --> 00:45:18,669
Look...

384
00:45:21,179 --> 00:45:26,090
...you're all I've got. I'm not leaving
until you help me.

385
00:45:26,684 --> 00:45:30,848
I don't care how long it takes,
because I can talk forever.

386
00:45:44,702 --> 00:45:48,866
- Hello.
- Hi, is this Molly Jensen?

387
00:45:49,081 --> 00:45:52,700
My name is Oda Mae Brown,
I'm a spiritual advisor.

388
00:45:52,919 --> 00:45:55,042
I have a message for you.

389
00:45:55,254 --> 00:46:00,249
It sounds crazy, but it's not. You've
got to believe me, don't be afraid.

390
00:46:01,427 --> 00:46:04,511
- Who is this?
- I've got a message from Sam.

391
00:46:07,225 --> 00:46:09,680
- What?
- Sam Wheat asked me to call.

392
00:46:13,231 --> 00:46:15,769
- I told you.
- You've got to go there.

393
00:46:15,983 --> 00:46:18,474
I'm not going anywhere.

394
00:46:19,278 --> 00:46:22,113
Second verse, same as the first.

395
00:46:22,323 --> 00:46:26,784
I'm Henry the Eighth, I am
Henry the Eighth I am, I am...

396
00:46:26,994 --> 00:46:32,155
I got married to the widow next door,
she's been married seven times before

397
00:46:39,674 --> 00:46:45,012
Henry the Eighth I am, I am
Henry the Eighth I am

398
00:46:45,221 --> 00:46:47,593
Second verse, same as the first

399
00:46:47,807 --> 00:46:52,683
I'm Henry the Eighth, I am
Henry the Eighth I am, I am...

400
00:46:52,895 --> 00:46:57,225
- I got married to the widow next door.
- All right. Stop singing.

401
00:46:57,441 --> 00:47:01,570
I'll go anywhere you want to,
just don't sing any more.

402
00:47:08,161 --> 00:47:13,036
I can't believe I'm doing this. What
am I doing here? I hate downtown.

403
00:47:13,249 --> 00:47:16,665
She's probably not even there.
Where are you?

404
00:47:19,672 --> 00:47:21,546
Which building is it?

405
00:47:23,801 --> 00:47:25,841
Push 3.

406
00:47:26,846 --> 00:47:29,551
- See, nobody's there.
- Just wait.

407
00:47:29,765 --> 00:47:33,300
I did everything I said I would.
She's not there. I'm going.

408
00:47:33,519 --> 00:47:35,808
I'm sorry.

409
00:47:37,732 --> 00:47:40,223
All right, don't sing.

410
00:47:42,028 --> 00:47:44,697
- Hello?
- Hi... She can't hear you.

411
00:47:44,906 --> 00:47:48,654
I called you last night
about your friend, Sam Wheat.

412
00:47:50,536 --> 00:47:51,912
I told you.

413
00:47:59,128 --> 00:48:02,414
Hey, Molly. I know you're up there.

414
00:48:02,632 --> 00:48:05,798
I know you hear me.
Sam wants to talk to you.

415
00:48:06,010 --> 00:48:08,086
This is for real.

416
00:48:08,304 --> 00:48:11,056
Remember the starfish at Montego Bay?

417
00:48:11,265 --> 00:48:13,637
How would I know that?

418
00:48:14,477 --> 00:48:18,177
I know about the underwear
you wrote your name on.

419
00:48:18,397 --> 00:48:20,437
I won't forget that.

420
00:48:21,192 --> 00:48:24,359
I know about the picture in Reno.

421
00:48:24,570 --> 00:48:26,029
Hey, Molly.

422
00:48:28,449 --> 00:48:32,114
The sweater she knitted,
in the closet, that's too big.

423
00:48:32,328 --> 00:48:37,370
He just told me about the sweater
that you knitted that's too big.

424
00:48:38,251 --> 00:48:40,327
Four sizes.

425
00:48:43,130 --> 00:48:45,538
- Do you hear me?
- I hear you.

426
00:48:45,758 --> 00:48:48,296
- Nobody's talking to you.
- Hear of the phone?

427
00:48:48,511 --> 00:48:51,049
Want to kiss my butt?

428
00:48:51,264 --> 00:48:53,755
- I won't stay here all day.
- Thank God.

429
00:48:53,975 --> 00:48:56,014
Shut up.

430
00:48:56,227 --> 00:49:00,640
Molly, I'm going to count to three,
and then I'm out of here.

431
00:49:00,857 --> 00:49:03,264
One-two-three.

432
00:49:03,484 --> 00:49:06,154
- No, wait.
- No.

433
00:49:06,362 --> 00:49:08,402
It's Molly.

434
00:49:14,287 --> 00:49:15,615
Molly?

435
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,669
I'm Oda Mae Brown.

436
00:49:25,715 --> 00:49:29,297
I don't know you or Sam,
but let me tell you what he did.

437
00:49:29,510 --> 00:49:33,460
He kept me up all night singing
'I'm Henry the Eighth, I am.'

438
00:49:33,681 --> 00:49:37,050
That's how he got me
to go out with him.

439
00:49:37,268 --> 00:49:39,308
Look, I'm sorry.

440
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:43,470
I just don't believe in this
life after death stuff.

441
00:49:43,691 --> 00:49:47,025
- Tell her she's wrong.
- He says you're wrong.

442
00:49:47,236 --> 00:49:50,071
- You're talking to him right now?
- Yeah.

443
00:49:50,281 --> 00:49:53,365
He asked me to tell you
that you're wrong.

444
00:49:53,576 --> 00:49:57,490
- Where is he?
- I can't see him, I can only hear him.

445
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:02,290
- I'm right here.
- That doesn't help, Sam.

446
00:50:04,086 --> 00:50:07,835
- I'm holding her hand.
- He says he's holding your hand.

447
00:50:18,518 --> 00:50:23,144
What are you doing?
What do you think you're doing to me?

448
00:50:23,356 --> 00:50:26,522
If you think I'm here for
my health, you're crazy.

449
00:50:26,734 --> 00:50:29,308
Sam's dead. He's dead.

450
00:50:30,571 --> 00:50:33,821
- Tell her I love her.
- He says he loves you.

451
00:50:35,117 --> 00:50:37,443
Sam would never say that.

452
00:50:37,662 --> 00:50:39,950
- Tell her "ditto.'
- What is "ditto'?

453
00:50:40,164 --> 00:50:42,204
Ditto.

454
00:51:11,863 --> 00:51:14,817
I don't know how I'm doing this.

455
00:51:15,032 --> 00:51:20,074
Confidentially - nothing like this
has ever happened to me before.

456
00:51:20,288 --> 00:51:22,826
Now I can't turn it off.

457
00:51:24,792 --> 00:51:28,161
- Is this him? Is this you?
- Yeah.

458
00:51:28,379 --> 00:51:31,463
Cute. White, but cute.

459
00:51:31,674 --> 00:51:34,960
What I don't understand is,
why did he come back?

460
00:51:35,178 --> 00:51:38,297
- I don't know.
- Why's he still here?

461
00:51:38,514 --> 00:51:41,432
He's stuck, he's in between worlds.

462
00:51:41,642 --> 00:51:45,261
Sometimes the spirit
gets yanked out so quick,

463
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:48,434
the essence still feels
it has work to do.

464
00:51:48,649 --> 00:51:52,398
- Stop rambling.
- I'm not, I'm answering a question.

465
00:51:52,612 --> 00:51:55,067
- He's got an attitude.
- I don't.

466
00:51:55,281 --> 00:51:58,365
Yes, you do.
We're having a little discussion.

467
00:51:58,576 --> 00:52:02,408
If you didn't, you wouldn't
have raised your voice.

468
00:52:02,622 --> 00:52:06,785
- Goddammit...
- Don't take the Lord's name in vain.

469
00:52:07,001 --> 00:52:09,670
- Would you relax?
- You're the dead guy.

470
00:52:09,879 --> 00:52:12,963
If you want me to help,
you'd better apologize.

471
00:52:13,174 --> 00:52:17,800
That's it, I'm leaving.
Nobody talks to me like that.

472
00:52:18,012 --> 00:52:23,351
- Now, you'd better apologize.
- I'm sorry. I apologize. OK?

473
00:52:23,559 --> 00:52:26,726
Now would you sit down?

474
00:52:26,938 --> 00:52:29,642
- Please?
- He's apologized.

475
00:52:31,108 --> 00:52:34,109
I need you to tell Molly
what I'm saying,

476
00:52:34,320 --> 00:52:37,736
but you have to tell her
word for word, all right?

477
00:52:37,949 --> 00:52:43,109
Yes. He wants me to tell you
what he's saying word for word.

478
00:52:48,084 --> 00:52:51,369
- Molly, you're in danger.
- You can't blurt it out like that.

479
00:52:51,587 --> 00:52:55,965
Quit moving around - you're making
me dizzy. I'll tell her in my own way.

480
00:52:57,176 --> 00:53:00,213
Molly, you're in danger, girl.

481
00:53:02,473 --> 00:53:06,553
- What are you talking about?
- He knows the man who killed him.

482
00:53:06,769 --> 00:53:09,806
His name is Willie Lopez,
and I know where he lives.

483
00:53:10,022 --> 00:53:14,103
His name is Willie Lopez,
and he knows where he lives.

484
00:53:14,318 --> 00:53:16,774
- Write it down.
- I ain't no secretary.

485
00:53:16,988 --> 00:53:19,027
Just do it.

486
00:53:20,950 --> 00:53:23,108
He's so testy.

487
00:53:23,327 --> 00:53:27,159
- What do I write?
- It's 303, Prospect Place, apt. 4D.

488
00:53:28,541 --> 00:53:30,580
303 Prospect Place?

489
00:53:32,003 --> 00:53:35,169
- It's my neighborhood.
- Molly, he's got my wallet,

490
00:53:35,381 --> 00:53:38,417
he's got my key, and he was in here.

491
00:53:38,634 --> 00:53:42,134
- He was in here.
- Yesterday, when you came back,

492
00:53:42,346 --> 00:53:45,431
you went upstairs,
you talked to Floyd...

493
00:53:45,641 --> 00:53:50,766
When you came back he was here.
He saw everything.

494
00:53:50,980 --> 00:53:55,108
Molly, go to the police.
It was a set-up. I was murdered.

495
00:53:56,527 --> 00:53:59,943
He says go to the police.
It was a set-up, he was murdered.

496
00:54:00,156 --> 00:54:04,319
- Somebody else is involved.
- Forget it. I don't want this.

497
00:54:04,535 --> 00:54:07,869
- Where are you going?
- I'm leaving.

498
00:54:08,080 --> 00:54:12,327
I did everything I said I would.
Don't follow me, because I'm finished.

499
00:54:12,543 --> 00:54:15,959
Have a nice life, have a nice death,
goodbye.

500
00:54:19,175 --> 00:54:23,504
There's no one on earth who'd
want this to be true more than me.

501
00:54:23,721 --> 00:54:26,675
You've got to be rational about this.

502
00:54:26,891 --> 00:54:29,892
Sam is no more in this room than...

503
00:54:32,897 --> 00:54:37,393
I understand the need
to hang on to him, I really do.

504
00:54:37,610 --> 00:54:42,735
- But this is absurd.
- It seems absurd, but it had to be real.

505
00:54:42,949 --> 00:54:46,816
How could you believe
a fortune-teller from Brooklyn?

506
00:54:47,036 --> 00:54:52,576
- I watched them have a conversation.
- I don't buy it, not for a minute.

507
00:54:52,792 --> 00:54:56,125
- What about the things she knew?
- What things?

508
00:54:56,921 --> 00:55:01,916
The photo Sam took of me
on our trip to Reno. We were alone.

509
00:55:02,134 --> 00:55:06,215
And the green underwear
that I wrote my name in.

510
00:55:08,683 --> 00:55:11,174
She said Sam knew who killed him.

511
00:55:13,312 --> 00:55:16,646
- That he was set up.
- This is getting deranged.

512
00:55:17,692 --> 00:55:20,443
- She had a name and an address.
- Good, Molly...

513
00:55:20,653 --> 00:55:23,856
Willie Lopez,
303 Prospect Place, apt. 4D.

514
00:55:25,992 --> 00:55:29,408
- This is sick.
- Carl.

515
00:55:33,916 --> 00:55:37,036
Molly, I don't understand
how you could...

516
00:55:39,213 --> 00:55:41,669
...swallow this crap.

517
00:55:41,883 --> 00:55:44,634
This guy may not even exist.

518
00:55:44,844 --> 00:55:49,138
Maybe she's using you
to set someone up.

519
00:55:49,348 --> 00:55:53,097
You're right. You're absolutely right.

520
00:55:53,311 --> 00:55:58,436
- That's what I've got to find out.
- How are you going to do that?

521
00:55:58,649 --> 00:56:01,140
She said Sam wants me
to go to the police.

522
00:56:01,360 --> 00:56:06,153
Sam wants you to go to the police?
Jesus, Moll....

523
00:56:06,365 --> 00:56:09,117
What are you going to tell them?

524
00:56:09,327 --> 00:56:13,490
That some storefront psychic lady
has been communing with the dead?

525
00:56:13,706 --> 00:56:17,834
Do you know how that sounds?
You're talking ghosts here.

526
00:56:19,795 --> 00:56:21,835
I'm sorry,

527
00:56:22,048 --> 00:56:24,420
this really gets to me.

528
00:56:24,634 --> 00:56:29,094
- It's OK if you don't believe me.
- I'm trying to, Molly.

529
00:56:32,725 --> 00:56:34,765
Look...

530
00:56:36,312 --> 00:56:40,939
...if it'll make you feel any better,
I'll go check this out.

531
00:56:41,150 --> 00:56:44,235
I want you to try and get some sleep.

532
00:56:44,445 --> 00:56:45,987
OK?

533
00:56:48,574 --> 00:56:51,824
I'll call you in the morning.
Goodnight.

534
00:57:19,063 --> 00:57:21,103
Be careful.

535
00:57:34,495 --> 00:57:37,947
Carl. What the hell
are you doing here?

536
00:57:40,334 --> 00:57:44,249
- Who have you been talking to?
- What do you mean?

537
00:57:44,463 --> 00:57:48,924
Some woman knows all about you.
Where's she getting it from?

538
00:57:49,135 --> 00:57:53,298
- I haven't said a word to anybody.
- She knows your name and address.

539
00:57:53,514 --> 00:57:58,675
- How do women know where I live?
- She knows about the murder.

540
00:58:00,188 --> 00:58:03,557
Now, I want you to find this bitch,
whoever she is,

541
00:58:03,774 --> 00:58:06,728
and I want you to...

542
00:58:07,820 --> 00:58:09,860
Just get rid of her, OK?

543
00:58:10,072 --> 00:58:14,781
I've got 4 million dollars
stuffed in a goddamn computer.

544
00:58:16,162 --> 00:58:20,871
If I don't get those codes, if that
money is not transferred soon...

545
00:58:23,044 --> 00:58:26,662
...I'm... dead. We're both dead.

546
00:58:26,881 --> 00:58:30,665
Tell them you only launder money
on the first of the month.

547
00:58:30,885 --> 00:58:35,346
What the hell is wrong with you?
Is everything a joke?

548
00:58:35,556 --> 00:58:39,091
You killed a man.
You were supposed to steal his wallet.

549
00:58:39,310 --> 00:58:43,059
I did you a favor, man,
that was a freebie.

550
00:58:43,272 --> 00:58:46,357
Look, these are drug dealers, OK?

551
00:58:47,860 --> 00:58:51,775
Just don't blow this for me, Willie.
I'd lose my job, go to jail.

552
00:58:51,989 --> 00:58:55,193
$80,000 of that money is mine.

553
00:58:58,538 --> 00:59:02,072
Let me have the keys
to Sam's apartment.

554
00:59:02,291 --> 00:59:05,376
I'll get the address book myself, OK?

555
00:59:31,529 --> 00:59:34,779
You goddamn bastard. Why?

556
00:59:34,991 --> 00:59:37,742
You were my friend.

557
00:59:39,745 --> 00:59:42,367
I had a life, goddamn you.

558
00:59:42,582 --> 00:59:44,621
I had a life.

559
00:59:52,800 --> 00:59:56,216
I don't even believe
in this stuff myself.

560
00:59:56,429 --> 00:59:58,468
But she was real.

561
00:59:58,764 --> 01:00:02,015
Do you think I'd come here
if it wasn't real?

562
01:00:04,103 --> 01:00:08,480
You told me if I had any new
information, that I should come.

563
01:00:08,691 --> 01:00:11,360
So, here I am.

564
01:00:14,614 --> 01:00:19,359
I know how this sounds. I hear myself
saying it, and I want to cringe.

565
01:00:20,703 --> 01:00:26,042
But she knew things she couldn't have
known. Things Sam only said to me.

566
01:00:26,250 --> 01:00:28,955
According to this psychic lady,

567
01:00:29,170 --> 01:00:33,748
there are ghosts and spirits
all over the place?

568
01:00:33,966 --> 01:00:37,170
Watching us all the time?

569
01:00:39,430 --> 01:00:42,846
I'm never going
to get undressed again.

570
01:00:43,059 --> 01:00:46,475
Excuse me.
I've got more important things to do.

571
01:00:57,698 --> 01:01:03,119
The guy's name is Willie Lopez.
All I'm asking is for you to check it out.

572
01:01:03,329 --> 01:01:07,956
OK. You wait here and let me see
if the guy's got a record.

573
01:01:09,085 --> 01:01:11,124
Right.

574
01:02:12,565 --> 01:02:17,856
- Where's the file on Willie Lopez?
- There's no file for Willie Lopez.

575
01:02:18,070 --> 01:02:22,234
He was probably some old boyfriend
she was trying to get even with.

576
01:02:22,450 --> 01:02:26,530
This psychic woman's
got a long record.

577
01:02:26,746 --> 01:02:29,747
1967, Shreveport.

578
01:02:29,957 --> 01:02:33,291
Forgery, selling of false ID.

579
01:02:33,503 --> 01:02:36,420
Served one year in 1971.

580
01:02:36,631 --> 01:02:38,872
Arrested for fraud,

581
01:02:39,091 --> 01:02:43,220
numbers racketeering,
served ten months, 1974.

582
01:02:43,429 --> 01:02:46,845
- Look, this is impossible.
- It goes on and on.

583
01:02:47,058 --> 01:02:51,387
She knew things - private things.
How could she have known all that?

584
01:02:51,604 --> 01:02:53,846
A lot of times they read the obits.

585
01:02:54,065 --> 01:02:57,350
All she had to do was see
the word "banker". Boom.

586
01:02:57,568 --> 01:03:02,111
They even go through your garbage
to find things they can use.

587
01:03:02,323 --> 01:03:06,155
Letters, old papers.
It doesn't take much.

588
01:03:06,369 --> 01:03:07,863
No.

589
01:03:09,747 --> 01:03:11,787
It was real.

590
01:03:13,793 --> 01:03:17,292
She knew about a sweater I knitted.

591
01:03:19,090 --> 01:03:21,960
And songs we sang.

592
01:03:26,055 --> 01:03:28,926
The trip to Montego Bay.

593
01:03:30,393 --> 01:03:33,263
I'm sorry. I know this is hard.

594
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:36,520
People want so much to believe.

595
01:03:36,732 --> 01:03:42,237
They're grieving, they're vulnerable.
And they will give anything...

596
01:03:42,446 --> 01:03:47,607
for one last moment. Believe me,
these people know what they're doing.

597
01:03:48,870 --> 01:03:53,994
I know how you must feel,
but you know you can press charges.

598
01:03:57,920 --> 01:03:59,664
No.

599
01:04:02,758 --> 01:04:04,798
Thank you.

600
01:04:18,399 --> 01:04:21,353
Oh, God, let this be it.

601
01:04:33,289 --> 01:04:34,914
Yes.

602
01:04:46,886 --> 01:04:49,459
- Hello.
- Eddie, it's Carl Bruner.

603
01:04:49,680 --> 01:04:54,342
Everything's fine. We're all set.
What do you want me to do?

604
01:04:54,560 --> 01:04:59,436
I want you to transfer the money
into a single account...

605
01:04:59,649 --> 01:05:02,436
under the name "Rita Miller.'

606
01:05:02,652 --> 01:05:06,151
Tomorrow, at five minutes
before closing, 3.55 pm,

607
01:05:06,364 --> 01:05:10,064
transfer the full account to
the First Island Bank of Nassau,

608
01:05:10,284 --> 01:05:13,985
registry number 486-9580.

609
01:05:14,205 --> 01:05:17,704
- Call us when it's done.
- OK, I've got it.

610
01:05:17,917 --> 01:05:22,413
Just tell Mr. Balistrari that there
won't be any more problems, OK.

611
01:05:22,630 --> 01:05:25,584
Yeah, I'll do that. Good work.

612
01:06:25,193 --> 01:06:28,977
Molly, why can't you hear me?
I need you.

613
01:06:41,834 --> 01:06:44,586
- Who is it?
- It's Carl, Molly.

614
01:06:45,129 --> 01:06:48,961
No, don't open the goddamn door.
He's a murderer.

615
01:06:49,175 --> 01:06:53,338
Listen, I know it's late.
I'm sorry to disturb you.

616
01:06:53,554 --> 01:06:55,962
I've been thinking about you all day.

617
01:06:56,182 --> 01:06:59,432
I feel really lousy about last night.

618
01:06:59,644 --> 01:07:04,436
- This supernatural thing...
- Don't worry about it, really. It's OK.

619
01:07:04,649 --> 01:07:07,650
It's not. You needed me
to hear you, and I didn't.

620
01:07:07,860 --> 01:07:12,487
I wasn't there for you,
and that was wrong.

621
01:07:12,698 --> 01:07:16,067
It's just... I just...

622
01:07:16,869 --> 01:07:19,656
I want you to know
that I'm your friend.

623
01:07:20,498 --> 01:07:23,071
- Thanks, Carl.
- You were never her friend.

624
01:07:23,292 --> 01:07:26,079
- That means a lot to me.
- Me, too.

625
01:07:26,295 --> 01:07:29,000
I've brought you some
Japanese apple pears.

626
01:07:32,218 --> 01:07:37,094
- Thanks, that's very sweet.
- Could I come in for a second?

627
01:07:37,306 --> 01:07:40,343
I won't stay long,
it's just been one of those days.

628
01:07:40,560 --> 01:07:43,347
- Yeah, come on in.
- No, Molly.

629
01:07:43,563 --> 01:07:46,896
You seem a little tense. Are you OK?

630
01:07:47,108 --> 01:07:52,268
No, I'm fine. It's just...
What can I tell you? It's been tough.

631
01:07:52,864 --> 01:07:55,271
It still hurts so much.

632
01:07:55,491 --> 01:08:00,118
- You lying snake.
- On top of it, there's stuff at work.

633
01:08:00,329 --> 01:08:03,912
They've given me my own accounts,
which is good.

634
01:08:04,125 --> 01:08:07,790
But I just haven't really
had time to adjust,

635
01:08:08,004 --> 01:08:09,996
to absorb everything.

636
01:08:13,259 --> 01:08:15,298
It's no big deal.

637
01:08:26,856 --> 01:08:30,059
- Can I have a little more cream?
- Yeah.

638
01:08:31,444 --> 01:08:35,228
Shit.
Jesus, I can't believe I did that.

639
01:08:35,448 --> 01:08:38,318
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

640
01:08:40,453 --> 01:08:44,700
- Let me throw that in the washer.
- Don't worry about it. It's OK.

641
01:08:44,916 --> 01:08:48,830
- Can I get you another shirt?
- No, it'll dry in a minute.

642
01:08:54,300 --> 01:08:58,677
Where were you today? I thought
you were coming into the bank.

643
01:09:00,223 --> 01:09:05,644
I was supposed to, but I didn't
have time. I went to the police.

644
01:09:11,400 --> 01:09:16,691
You did? What did you tell them?
What did they say?

645
01:09:16,906 --> 01:09:18,945
It was awful.

646
01:09:19,534 --> 01:09:21,906
I felt really stupid.

647
01:09:23,120 --> 01:09:27,948
They brought out a file on this woman
at least ten inches thick.

648
01:09:28,167 --> 01:09:30,658
- Rip-off artist?
- No, Molly.

649
01:09:32,922 --> 01:09:37,880
You know, the sad thing
is that I believed her.

650
01:09:38,886 --> 01:09:40,713
Molly...

651
01:09:40,930 --> 01:09:43,635
...sometimes we need to believe.

652
01:09:44,600 --> 01:09:46,889
Why? What's the point?

653
01:09:47,103 --> 01:09:50,223
It's not easy to face the realities of life.

654
01:09:50,439 --> 01:09:53,191
Sometimes you've got
to give yourself that.

655
01:09:53,401 --> 01:09:56,900
You've got to remember
the love you guys felt. That's real.

656
01:09:57,113 --> 01:10:00,482
Remember how good Sam was,
how much he loved you.

657
01:10:00,700 --> 01:10:04,863
You were everything to him, Molly.
You were his life.

658
01:10:18,467 --> 01:10:20,425
I feel so alone.

659
01:10:28,728 --> 01:10:31,894
You're not alone, OK.

660
01:10:32,106 --> 01:10:35,522
You've got your work - you're talented.
You're young.

661
01:10:35,735 --> 01:10:38,819
You're fantastically gorgeous.

662
01:10:40,364 --> 01:10:43,698
I don't know what's real anymore.

663
01:10:43,910 --> 01:10:46,864
I don't know what to think.

664
01:10:49,248 --> 01:10:51,953
Just think about Sam.

665
01:10:53,836 --> 01:10:59,127
Think about the time you two guys
had together. How wonderful that was.

666
01:11:02,887 --> 01:11:05,888
Let your feelings out, it's OK.

667
01:11:06,098 --> 01:11:08,554
Life turns on a dime.

668
01:11:10,311 --> 01:11:12,719
You know...?

669
01:11:15,191 --> 01:11:20,814
People think they're forever, that there
is always tomorrow. That's bullshit.

670
01:11:21,030 --> 01:11:23,651
Sam taught us that.

671
01:11:23,866 --> 01:11:26,784
We have to live for now.

672
01:11:29,705 --> 01:11:31,912
For today.

673
01:11:51,018 --> 01:11:53,391
- I can't. I'm sorry.
- It's OK.

674
01:11:53,604 --> 01:11:57,056
- I can't, it's just too soon.
- It's OK.

675
01:11:57,275 --> 01:12:00,026
You've been great, Carl.

676
01:12:01,654 --> 01:12:05,604
- But I need you to leave.
- It's OK, I understand.

677
01:12:05,825 --> 01:12:07,568
Please...

678
01:12:13,541 --> 01:12:17,289
Could we just have dinner tomorrow?
Just talk.

679
01:12:19,714 --> 01:12:22,252
- Yeah, sure.
- Great.

680
01:13:31,581 --> 01:13:33,206
Hey.

681
01:13:36,795 --> 01:13:39,831
- Get off my train.
- No.

682
01:13:40,048 --> 01:13:41,673
Get off.

683
01:13:42,342 --> 01:13:45,129
Get off. Get off.

684
01:13:45,345 --> 01:13:47,753
Get off. Get out of here.

685
01:13:47,973 --> 01:13:49,930
- Get off.
- No.

686
01:13:50,142 --> 01:13:53,427
Show me how you do that.
I'm not leaving till you teach me.

687
01:13:53,645 --> 01:13:55,934
Get off.

688
01:13:56,148 --> 01:13:58,436
- No.
- Get off.

689
01:14:04,865 --> 01:14:07,985
You stubborn asshole.

690
01:14:10,495 --> 01:14:16,331
What the hell are you doing? You're
trying to move it with your fingers.

691
01:14:16,543 --> 01:14:20,161
You can't push it with your finger.
You're dead.

692
01:14:27,679 --> 01:14:32,804
It's all in your mind. Your problem
is that you still think you're real.

693
01:14:33,018 --> 01:14:37,016
You think you're wearing those clothes?
That you're crouching there?

694
01:14:37,230 --> 01:14:42,225
Bullshit. You ain't got a body no more.
It's all up here now.

695
01:14:42,444 --> 01:14:47,865
You want to move something, you've
got to move it with your mind. Focus.

696
01:14:48,075 --> 01:14:52,155
- How? How do you focus?
- I don't know how you focus.

697
01:14:52,371 --> 01:14:54,410
You just focus.

698
01:14:57,584 --> 01:14:59,411
How did you do that?

699
01:14:59,628 --> 01:15:03,293
You take all of your emotions,
all your anger, love, hate.

700
01:15:03,507 --> 01:15:06,923
Push it, down here
into the pit of your stomach,

701
01:15:07,135 --> 01:15:09,922
and then let it explode, like a reactor.

702
01:15:19,731 --> 01:15:21,605
Don't laugh.

703
01:15:45,799 --> 01:15:49,085
- Way to go, kid.
- I did it.

704
01:15:49,303 --> 01:15:51,591
I did it.

705
01:15:51,805 --> 01:15:53,845
Way to go.

706
01:16:00,772 --> 01:16:03,726
From your gut, like I told you.

707
01:16:06,111 --> 01:16:09,195
Give it time.
What else have you got?

708
01:16:17,247 --> 01:16:19,999
How long have you been here?

709
01:16:21,293 --> 01:16:23,332
Since they pushed me.

710
01:16:23,545 --> 01:16:26,250
- Someone pushed you?
- Yeah.

711
01:16:26,465 --> 01:16:29,501
- Who?
- You don't believe me?

712
01:16:29,718 --> 01:16:33,585
You think I fell? You think I jumped?
Well, fuck you.

713
01:16:33,805 --> 01:16:37,174
It wasn't my time.
I wasn't supposed to go.

714
01:16:37,392 --> 01:16:39,966
I'm not supposed to be here.

715
01:16:49,655 --> 01:16:53,106
I'd give anything for a drag.

716
01:16:53,325 --> 01:16:57,405
- Just one drag.
- Are you all right?

717
01:16:57,621 --> 01:17:02,413
Who are you? Why are you
hounding me? Who sent you?

718
01:17:04,586 --> 01:17:06,911
Who sent you?

719
01:17:09,007 --> 01:17:11,249
Leave me alone.

720
01:18:13,780 --> 01:18:17,149
Concentrate, and you'll
probably rouse him.

721
01:18:17,367 --> 01:18:20,617
- What's his name again?
- Orlando.

722
01:18:20,829 --> 01:18:24,743
Orlando, Orlando.
Is there an Orlando here?

723
01:18:24,958 --> 01:18:26,951
- I'm here.
- He's here.

724
01:18:27,169 --> 01:18:31,332
- Sam.
- I'm Orlando. The line's over there.

725
01:18:31,548 --> 01:18:35,795
Where did these ghosts come from?
You can hear them, too?

726
01:18:36,011 --> 01:18:40,589
In the morning and in the evening.
They come into the shower.

727
01:18:40,807 --> 01:18:43,595
Did you tell every spook in the world
about me?

728
01:18:43,810 --> 01:18:48,603
I got spooks from Jersey. There's stuff
going on you wouldn't believe.

729
01:18:48,815 --> 01:18:53,561
- It's amazing. You're really doing it.
- Can you please hurry this up?

730
01:18:53,779 --> 01:18:55,771
Chill out.

731
01:18:55,989 --> 01:18:59,275
I need your help again.
There's something we need to do.

732
01:18:59,493 --> 01:19:02,066
I'm not doing anything else with you.

733
01:19:02,287 --> 01:19:07,661
You're holding on to a life that doesn't
want you anymore. Give up the ghost.

734
01:19:07,876 --> 01:19:12,585
- Are you speaking to me?
- Does it look like I'm speaking to you?

735
01:19:12,798 --> 01:19:17,792
You're supposed to be concentrating.
Are you going to try it?

736
01:19:18,011 --> 01:19:20,681
Are you going to get out?
I've got work to do.

737
01:19:20,889 --> 01:19:25,634
Fine, then stay there.
Excuse me, are you ready now?

738
01:19:25,852 --> 01:19:28,225
Let's do it.

739
01:19:28,438 --> 01:19:32,222
Listen, I've got to talk to you now.
I've got a plan.

740
01:19:35,570 --> 01:19:37,065
Oda Mae?

741
01:19:43,620 --> 01:19:45,447
Oda Mae?

742
01:19:47,082 --> 01:19:49,288
Ortisha.

743
01:19:49,501 --> 01:19:54,377
- Orlando. Is that you?
- Where are you at? I can hardly see.

744
01:19:54,589 --> 01:19:57,543
- She's here.
- In front of you. I'm right here.

745
01:20:03,432 --> 01:20:06,765
Damn, baby, what did you do
to your hair?

746
01:20:08,020 --> 01:20:12,017
Orlando, do you like it?
Its autumn sunrise.

747
01:20:15,193 --> 01:20:17,945
Get out of me, you son of a bitch.

748
01:20:21,783 --> 01:20:24,950
- Don't ever do that to me again.
- Orlando...?

749
01:20:26,955 --> 01:20:28,995
I can barely move.

750
01:20:29,207 --> 01:20:33,075
You should know better.
Jumping into bodies wipes you out.

751
01:20:33,295 --> 01:20:38,123
- Everybody out.
- What happened to Orlando?

752
01:20:38,342 --> 01:20:42,007
Are you deaf? I said everybody out.

753
01:20:42,220 --> 01:20:46,004
Everybody out. Get out, get out.
Everybody get out.

754
01:20:58,779 --> 01:21:01,614
Get out.
- Are you the fortune-teller?

755
01:21:01,823 --> 01:21:05,572
- Who are you?
- That's an interesting question.

756
01:21:05,786 --> 01:21:08,407
- Why don't you tell me?
- Willie.

757
01:21:08,664 --> 01:21:09,992
Willie?

758
01:21:10,749 --> 01:21:13,620
- Prospect Place Willie?
- Get out of here fast.

759
01:21:29,893 --> 01:21:32,562
I'm all right.

760
01:21:34,106 --> 01:21:39,527
- We're in trouble. You have to help.
- Who's we? You're already dead.

761
01:21:39,736 --> 01:21:43,401
- They're trying to kill me.
- And they'll be back.

762
01:21:43,615 --> 01:21:46,949
Why don't you find a house to haunt?

763
01:21:47,160 --> 01:21:49,698
Get some chains and rattle them.

764
01:21:49,913 --> 01:21:53,116
I have a plan.
You've got to get some fake IDs.

765
01:21:53,333 --> 01:21:57,995
- Forget it.
- If you do this, they'll leave you alone.

766
01:22:03,176 --> 01:22:04,801
Scout's honour.

767
01:22:06,179 --> 01:22:07,804
All right.

768
01:22:08,015 --> 01:22:11,015
What exactly do I have to do?

769
01:22:13,061 --> 01:22:15,517
Have you got a nice dress?

770
01:22:17,607 --> 01:22:22,483
- What's wrong with my clothes?
- I made a joke. I love your shoes.

771
01:22:22,696 --> 01:22:27,987
I'm going home. I don't know anything
about banking. I don't know if it'll work.

772
01:22:28,201 --> 01:22:30,739
- Just relax.
- I'm nervous.

773
01:22:30,954 --> 01:22:34,868
I know you're nervous,
but I'll get you through it.

774
01:22:35,083 --> 01:22:37,325
I don't think I should do this.

775
01:22:37,544 --> 01:22:42,586
- We're going to New Accounts.
- I'm giving them no money.

776
01:22:42,799 --> 01:22:45,504
Do what I say, and don't talk.

777
01:22:46,553 --> 01:22:50,218
You're here to fill out a signature card
for a new account.

778
01:22:50,432 --> 01:22:52,472
- Can I help you?
- Yes.

779
01:22:52,684 --> 01:22:55,519
I'm here to fill out
a card for a new account.

780
01:22:55,729 --> 01:22:59,679
Do you know your account number?
- 926-31043.

781
01:22:59,900 --> 01:23:03,269
926-31043.

782
01:23:05,322 --> 01:23:07,196
- Rita Miller.
- What?

783
01:23:07,407 --> 01:23:08,866
Tell her Rita Miller.

784
01:23:09,076 --> 01:23:11,827
Didn't you sign when you
opened the account?

785
01:23:12,037 --> 01:23:14,658
Tell her Carl Bruner did it by phone.

786
01:23:14,873 --> 01:23:18,823
Carl Bruner opened that account
for me by phone,

787
01:23:19,044 --> 01:23:22,080
and he's asked me to come in today.

788
01:23:23,131 --> 01:23:25,753
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

789
01:23:27,886 --> 01:23:31,635
Just sign this card
on the bottom line, please.

790
01:23:31,848 --> 01:23:34,304
May I use your pen?

791
01:23:40,315 --> 01:23:42,355
No. Rita Miller.

792
01:23:42,567 --> 01:23:44,607
I'm so sorry.

793
01:23:44,820 --> 01:23:48,687
I need another one.
I signed the wrong name.

794
01:23:55,747 --> 01:23:59,875
Tell her to send it up to the third floor
file, you have a transaction to make.

795
01:24:00,085 --> 01:24:04,913
Make sure this goes to the third floor,
I have a transfusion to make.

796
01:24:05,132 --> 01:24:06,958
Let's go.

797
01:24:07,175 --> 01:24:09,880
You know what I mean....
Can I keep this pen?

798
01:24:11,722 --> 01:24:14,841
- Yes, sure.
- Thank you so much.

799
01:24:16,059 --> 01:24:19,226
Bye-bye. I love these pens.

800
01:24:19,438 --> 01:24:22,355
What do you want to keep the pen for?

801
01:24:24,234 --> 01:24:27,769
Carl Bruner speaking. Mr. Balistrari?

802
01:24:27,988 --> 01:24:30,313
Balistrari? It's me, John.

803
01:24:30,532 --> 01:24:32,857
John... Sorry.

804
01:24:33,076 --> 01:24:35,283
What's up?

805
01:24:35,495 --> 01:24:38,580
I've got the info
on the Bradley portfolio.

806
01:24:38,790 --> 01:24:43,037
- I'll pick it up later, all right?
- I'll be here till six.

807
01:24:49,634 --> 01:24:52,172
I couldn't talk you into losing the hat?

808
01:24:52,387 --> 01:24:56,515
Keep messing with me,
you'll be here by yourself.

809
01:24:56,725 --> 01:24:59,809
You're here to see Lyle Ferguson.

810
01:25:01,063 --> 01:25:04,977
- I'm here to see Lyle Ferguson.
- Do you have an appointment?

811
01:25:05,192 --> 01:25:08,940
- No, I'm here for my health.
- Tell him Rita Miller's here.

812
01:25:09,154 --> 01:25:12,605
- Tell him Rita Miller's here.
- Just one moment, please.

813
01:25:12,824 --> 01:25:15,362
- Don't embellish.
- Jawohl.

814
01:25:15,577 --> 01:25:17,700
Excuse me?

815
01:25:20,123 --> 01:25:23,290
This guy Ferguson is a real jerk.

816
01:25:23,502 --> 01:25:26,456
I've known him five years.

817
01:25:26,672 --> 01:25:30,171
- Why are you whispering?
- Just listen.

818
01:25:30,384 --> 01:25:33,966
He's a social moron,
you've got nothing to worry about.

819
01:25:34,179 --> 01:25:39,719
Tell the guard Ferguson knows you,
from the Brewster's Christmas party.

820
01:25:39,935 --> 01:25:42,640
What is this in regards to?

821
01:25:42,854 --> 01:25:48,608
He doesn't remember me? We spent
time at the Brewster's, last Christmas.

822
01:25:48,819 --> 01:25:54,572
He and his lovely wife, Shirley. It was
beautiful. A big old tree and presents...

823
01:25:57,744 --> 01:25:59,073
Gas.

824
01:26:00,872 --> 01:26:03,909
I get a little gas from time to time.

825
01:26:06,086 --> 01:26:09,502
- Quit poking me.
- Well, don't overdo it.

826
01:26:10,340 --> 01:26:16,176
Ferguson was so drunk, he could've
met Tina Turner and not remember.

827
01:26:22,311 --> 01:26:24,636
Here we go.

828
01:26:27,149 --> 01:26:28,976
Hello.

829
01:26:31,778 --> 01:26:35,147
Of course.
Well, it's been a long time.

830
01:26:35,365 --> 01:26:38,070
- A long time.
- Ask about Bobby and Snooky.

831
01:26:38,285 --> 01:26:42,698
- How are Bobby and Snooky?
- Fine... fine.

832
01:26:42,914 --> 01:26:45,536
Thank you for asking.

833
01:26:45,751 --> 01:26:47,909
And how is your...

834
01:26:48,128 --> 01:26:51,912
...family?
Couldn't be better.

835
01:26:52,132 --> 01:26:54,338
Well, wonderful.

836
01:26:54,551 --> 01:26:58,252
Ask how they did
on the Gibraltar Securities.

837
01:26:58,472 --> 01:27:03,098
I was wondering, how did you do
on the Gibraltar Securities?

838
01:27:03,310 --> 01:27:08,019
Gibraltar Securities? Well, it looks like
we topped out on that one.

839
01:27:08,231 --> 01:27:11,731
- We sure did.
- That was a very useful tip.

840
01:27:11,943 --> 01:27:14,351
Good old Randy.

841
01:27:14,571 --> 01:27:17,192
Got a good head on his
shoulders... her shoulders.

842
01:27:17,407 --> 01:27:19,898
- Her shoulders.
- Randy.

843
01:27:21,244 --> 01:27:24,578
So, what brings you here today?

844
01:27:24,790 --> 01:27:27,078
I'm closing an account.

845
01:27:27,292 --> 01:27:29,783
Do you have your account number?

846
01:27:30,003 --> 01:27:33,170
Yes? Yes.
- 926-31043.

847
01:27:33,382 --> 01:27:34,792
926...

848
01:27:35,008 --> 01:27:37,582
..31043. Is that right?

849
01:27:47,604 --> 01:27:53,144
Well, Rita, it looks like you'll be
withdrawing four million dollars.

850
01:27:53,360 --> 01:27:56,277
- Four million dollars.
- Say yes.

851
01:27:56,488 --> 01:27:59,157
- Is that correct?
- Yes.

852
01:28:00,993 --> 01:28:03,993
Yes. That's correct.

853
01:28:07,958 --> 01:28:11,706
- How would you like that?
- Tens and twenties.

854
01:28:11,920 --> 01:28:14,838
- Pardon?
- Tell him a cashier's cheque.

855
01:28:15,048 --> 01:28:18,880
- A cashier's cheque.
- Cashier's cheque. Fine.

856
01:28:19,094 --> 01:28:22,629
Of course, you know
we require identification.

857
01:28:24,182 --> 01:28:26,720
It's a procedural thing.

858
01:28:38,030 --> 01:28:41,114
Thank you. I'll be right back.

859
01:28:42,868 --> 01:28:45,193
Four million dollars.

860
01:28:51,335 --> 01:28:55,961
Get me the First Island Bank
of Nassau. It's on the Rolodex.

861
01:29:04,890 --> 01:29:08,508
Now, we have some things
for you to sign here.

862
01:29:08,727 --> 01:29:11,396
This officially closes the account.

863
01:29:14,441 --> 01:29:16,268
Sign "Rita Miller.'

864
01:29:18,570 --> 01:29:21,144
Miller - that's my name.

865
01:29:21,365 --> 01:29:23,856
My name - Rita Miller.

866
01:29:26,078 --> 01:29:27,453
My name.

867
01:29:29,623 --> 01:29:31,746
I'll be right back.

868
01:29:33,335 --> 01:29:36,419
- Just anywhere?
- Right here.

869
01:29:41,635 --> 01:29:43,046
Fine.

870
01:29:43,261 --> 01:29:45,301
The cheque...

871
01:29:47,849 --> 01:29:49,889
...here you are.

872
01:29:58,902 --> 01:30:01,358
Mama took the money
from the oil wells,

873
01:30:01,571 --> 01:30:04,145
and she sunk it into gas pumps.

874
01:30:04,366 --> 01:30:09,360
And those gas stations have five
or six of those things, so it's lucrative.

875
01:30:09,579 --> 01:30:13,245
- Oda Mae, we've got to go.
- Got to go now.

876
01:30:13,458 --> 01:30:17,871
It's been a pleasure doing business.
May I keep the pen?

877
01:30:18,088 --> 01:30:21,005
Say goodnight to Bobby
and Snooky for me.

878
01:30:21,216 --> 01:30:23,043
Bye-bye.

879
01:30:28,849 --> 01:30:30,722
What is wrong?

880
01:30:40,360 --> 01:30:42,400
Excuse me - Lyle?

881
01:30:42,612 --> 01:30:44,689
Molly Jensen.

882
01:30:44,906 --> 01:30:49,284
The woman you were doing business
with. What did she want?

883
01:30:49,494 --> 01:30:52,579
Did it have anything to do
with me or Sam?

884
01:30:52,789 --> 01:30:56,953
- Sam? No.
- That was Oda Mae Brown, right?

885
01:30:57,169 --> 01:31:01,332
Her name was Rita Miller.
She was closing an account.

886
01:31:01,548 --> 01:31:04,253
Is there a problem?

887
01:31:04,468 --> 01:31:06,507
No. I guess not.

888
01:31:37,459 --> 01:31:40,211
Carl? Is something wrong?

889
01:31:40,420 --> 01:31:43,623
Did somebody play with the computers?

890
01:31:43,840 --> 01:31:47,174
- One of my accounts is closed.
- What's wrong?

891
01:31:47,386 --> 01:31:51,170
- Do you want me to call someone?
- It's OK.

892
01:31:55,936 --> 01:31:59,768
Four million dollars. What am I
going to do with this money?

893
01:31:59,982 --> 01:32:03,267
I'm going to buy the building.
No, I'll buy the block.

894
01:32:03,485 --> 01:32:07,068
I'm going to make
my sister go to a fat farm.

895
01:32:08,907 --> 01:32:12,905
Wait, Oda Mae.
Take the cheque out of your purse.

896
01:32:13,120 --> 01:32:16,785
You're right, I'll put it
where nobody can get it.

897
01:32:16,999 --> 01:32:19,406
No. Endorse it.

898
01:32:19,626 --> 01:32:22,960
No, if I drop it,
then somebody will get it.

899
01:32:23,171 --> 01:32:27,003
It's not yours.
I never said you would get the money.

900
01:32:27,217 --> 01:32:31,796
This is blood money. I was killed
for this money. Endorse the cheque.

901
01:32:32,014 --> 01:32:37,055
- What are you going to do with it?
- Look over there.

902
01:32:37,269 --> 01:32:39,760
To your left.

903
01:32:42,983 --> 01:32:47,146
You don't think I'm giving this
to a bunch of nuns?

904
01:32:47,362 --> 01:32:51,656
Otherwise they will track you down.
Your only protection is to get rid of it.

905
01:32:51,867 --> 01:32:54,405
You're kidding me.

906
01:32:54,619 --> 01:32:57,289
You'll go to heaven.

907
01:32:57,497 --> 01:33:00,783
I want to go to a bank
and cash this cheque.

908
01:33:04,713 --> 01:33:07,880
- Hello.
- You'll thank me later.

909
01:33:10,385 --> 01:33:13,172
- Endorse it "Rita Miller.'
- I know.

910
01:33:13,388 --> 01:33:15,926
Make it out to St Joseph's Shelter.

911
01:33:16,141 --> 01:33:19,308
I don't believe
you're making me do this.

912
01:33:24,232 --> 01:33:27,851
- Give it to her.
- I just want to feel it in my fingers.

913
01:33:28,070 --> 01:33:31,770
- Just give her the cheque.
- I will.

914
01:33:38,497 --> 01:33:41,451
- Give her the cheque.
- I will.

915
01:33:44,670 --> 01:33:48,121
Bless you, child. Bless you.

916
01:33:53,053 --> 01:33:54,927
Give it to her.

917
01:33:55,681 --> 01:33:57,922
Let go. Let go.

918
01:34:05,273 --> 01:34:08,892
- I'm proud of you.
- I don't care. Stay away from me.

919
01:34:09,111 --> 01:34:12,859
What'll that nun do with it?
She can't go buy underwear.

920
01:34:13,073 --> 01:34:16,074
Leave me alone.
Never talk to me again.

921
01:34:16,284 --> 01:34:18,858
You're wonderful, Oda Mae.

922
01:34:54,281 --> 01:34:57,235
Go ahead, search. You'll never find it.

923
01:34:58,910 --> 01:35:04,581
They're going to kill you and Willie.
You're going to be fertilizer.

924
01:35:04,791 --> 01:35:07,958
They're going to bury
you next to Jimmy Hoffa.

925
01:35:51,963 --> 01:35:54,205
Who's doing that?

926
01:35:54,424 --> 01:35:56,666
Who's doing that?

927
01:36:12,943 --> 01:36:16,526
Hi. Where were you?
I thought we were having dinner.

928
01:36:16,738 --> 01:36:20,902
- Things got a little crazy, I forgot.
- A little trouble at the bank.

929
01:36:21,118 --> 01:36:24,487
I wish you'd have called.
I've been worried.

930
01:36:26,123 --> 01:36:31,117
- I've got to ask you about something.
- He needs to borrow $4,000,000.

931
01:36:31,336 --> 01:36:35,879
When you said you thought
Sam was talking to you,

932
01:36:36,091 --> 01:36:38,962
what did he say to you?
Why?

933
01:36:39,177 --> 01:36:44,302
Listen, I want to know exactly what
this psychic lady told you.

934
01:36:44,516 --> 01:36:46,924
Carl, let me go. Stop this.

935
01:36:49,855 --> 01:36:52,772
It doesn't matter. It wasn't real.

936
01:36:53,942 --> 01:36:56,564
What the hell's happened to you?

937
01:36:56,778 --> 01:37:00,230
Does this have anything to do
with her being at the bank today?

938
01:37:03,285 --> 01:37:05,361
At the bank?

939
01:37:05,579 --> 01:37:08,284
Ferguson said she closed an account.

940
01:37:08,498 --> 01:37:13,326
Her name isn't even Oda Mae Brown.
It's Rita Miller.

941
01:37:17,132 --> 01:37:19,705
Carl. Are you all right?

942
01:37:21,637 --> 01:37:24,210
It's just my stomach.

943
01:37:27,684 --> 01:37:30,804
Do you have some Pepto-Bismol?

944
01:37:31,021 --> 01:37:35,398
- Cyanide.
- It's upstairs. Sit down, I'll get it.

945
01:37:41,657 --> 01:37:45,986
What's wrong?
Does little Carl have a tummy ache?

946
01:37:52,084 --> 01:37:54,954
Now do you believe in ghosts?

947
01:37:58,340 --> 01:38:00,795
I'll set the place on fire.

948
01:38:08,809 --> 01:38:11,181
- I'll cut her throat.
- Carl.

949
01:38:12,813 --> 01:38:16,016
I swear to God. I'll cut her throat.

950
01:38:18,694 --> 01:38:22,643
I need that money.
I want it tonight, at 11 o'clock.

951
01:38:22,864 --> 01:38:27,776
If that psychic lady does not
bring it here, Molly is dead, OK?

952
01:38:27,995 --> 01:38:30,486
Carl, who are you talking to?

953
01:38:30,706 --> 01:38:33,956
Nothing. Molly, I have to go.

954
01:38:34,167 --> 01:38:37,371
I can't explain it now,
but there's a problem at the bank.

955
01:38:37,587 --> 01:38:41,336
- You're scaring me.
- I can't talk now, I'll be back.

956
01:38:41,550 --> 01:38:44,041
- Why not now?
- I can't talk now.

957
01:38:44,261 --> 01:38:49,599
I'll come back at 11 o'clock, OK?
I'm sorry, but it's really important.

958
01:38:49,808 --> 01:38:51,931
- Eleven.
- Oda Mae.

959
01:38:56,023 --> 01:39:01,064
I'm Arsenio Hall. Don't try
to adjust your television. I'm black.

960
01:39:01,278 --> 01:39:06,023
- I want to watch "Love Connection".
- I love "Love Connection".

961
01:39:06,241 --> 01:39:08,815
Leave that. That's Arsenio.

962
01:39:09,036 --> 01:39:12,202
You love "Love Connection",
send your picture in.

963
01:39:12,414 --> 01:39:15,747
- She did.
- They just haven't answered yet.

964
01:39:15,959 --> 01:39:18,746
- Oda Mae.
- Sam?

965
01:39:18,962 --> 01:39:21,963
We're in trouble.
They want the cheque.

966
01:39:22,174 --> 01:39:26,421
The cheque you said
they would never know about?

967
01:39:26,637 --> 01:39:28,878
- What's happening?
- They're here.

968
01:39:29,097 --> 01:39:31,553
Get out of here, now. Go, go.

969
01:39:43,820 --> 01:39:45,979
Knock on the doors.

970
01:39:46,198 --> 01:39:48,404
Help.

971
01:39:48,617 --> 01:39:51,986
- Let us in.
- Who are you kidding?

972
01:40:02,839 --> 01:40:07,133
What are you doing?
The cat don't like visitors.

973
01:40:16,979 --> 01:40:20,810
They're going to get us. Where's Sam?

974
01:40:21,024 --> 01:40:24,725
- It looks like the bitch just left.
- I'll check downstairs.

975
01:40:36,248 --> 01:40:37,659
Carl?

976
01:41:27,382 --> 01:41:28,924
Willie.

977
01:41:38,226 --> 01:41:41,180
You've got a serious problem, man.

978
01:42:02,959 --> 01:42:05,581
Help me. Help.

979
01:43:02,686 --> 01:43:05,177
That dude is dead.

980
01:43:09,276 --> 01:43:11,150
You're dead, Willie.

981
01:43:41,350 --> 01:43:43,722
Help me.

982
01:44:05,540 --> 01:44:07,948
Tell the driver to hurry.

983
01:44:08,168 --> 01:44:11,917
- Can you step on it, please.
- I'm driving as fast as I can.

984
01:44:20,722 --> 01:44:22,845
Problems?

985
01:44:30,190 --> 01:44:32,859
- Carl, is that you?
- It's me, Oda Mae.

986
01:44:33,068 --> 01:44:38,407
I know what you think of me, but we've
got to talk. You are in serious danger.

987
01:44:38,615 --> 01:44:43,194
- I've got Sam here with me.
- Get the hell out of here.

988
01:44:43,412 --> 01:44:46,247
- I'm calling the police.
- Good. Tell her to do it.

989
01:44:46,456 --> 01:44:51,414
Fine. We want you to call the police.
But you've got to let us in.

990
01:44:51,628 --> 01:44:56,871
Don't you get it? Sam wasn't
accidentally killed, he was murdered.

991
01:44:57,092 --> 01:44:59,963
He found out
that Carl was laundering money.

992
01:45:00,178 --> 01:45:02,966
Carl is dangerous. He tried to kill me.

993
01:45:03,181 --> 01:45:07,345
He's going to try to kill you, too.
You are in deep, deep trouble.

994
01:45:07,561 --> 01:45:12,982
Why are you doing this to me?
Do you hear me?

995
01:45:13,191 --> 01:45:16,192
Why are you doing this to me?

996
01:45:18,488 --> 01:45:24,443
Oda Mae. Tell her she's wearing
the shirt that I spilt the margarita on,

997
01:45:24,661 --> 01:45:27,235
and the earrings
I gave her for Christmas.

998
01:45:27,456 --> 01:45:31,323
Sam says you're wearing the shirt
he spilt the margarita on,

999
01:45:31,543 --> 01:45:34,579
and the earrings
he gave you for Christmas.

1000
01:45:40,344 --> 01:45:43,594
Don't you see?
I'm not a fake. Not about this.

1001
01:45:49,061 --> 01:45:51,516
- Give me a penny.
- What?

1002
01:45:51,730 --> 01:45:56,855
- Push a penny under the door, now.
- What are you talking about?

1003
01:46:34,439 --> 01:46:37,855
- Tell her it's for luck.
- Sam says it's for luck.

1004
01:47:14,271 --> 01:47:16,762
Between Green and Mercer on Prince.

1005
01:47:16,982 --> 01:47:19,817
It's the grey building
across from the post office.

1006
01:47:20,027 --> 01:47:24,155
Thanks, Sergeant. Please hurry.
We'll be waiting.

1007
01:47:24,364 --> 01:47:27,318
- They're on their way.
- Good.

1008
01:47:28,827 --> 01:47:32,611
- What do we do now?
- Just wait.

1009
01:47:42,549 --> 01:47:44,589
Is Sam here?

1010
01:47:45,636 --> 01:47:47,260
Sam?

1011
01:47:48,305 --> 01:47:50,344
I'm sitting beside her.

1012
01:47:51,391 --> 01:47:54,558
He's sitting right beside you.

1013
01:48:03,654 --> 01:48:05,895
Sam, can you feel me?

1014
01:48:07,282 --> 01:48:09,654
With all my heart.

1015
01:48:09,868 --> 01:48:12,655
He says with all his heart.

1016
01:48:24,800 --> 01:48:28,500
I'd give anything
if I could just touch you once more.

1017
01:48:32,015 --> 01:48:36,558
He says he wishes he was alive again,
so he could touch you.

1018
01:48:38,939 --> 01:48:40,481
Me, too.

1019
01:48:57,416 --> 01:49:00,701
OK. Look - you can use me.

1020
01:49:02,629 --> 01:49:05,167
- Use you?
- Use my body.

1021
01:49:05,382 --> 01:49:08,252
- Use your body?
- Quick, before I change my mind.

1022
01:52:17,407 --> 01:52:20,077
- Molly, are you home?
- Carl.

1023
01:52:21,453 --> 01:52:23,944
- Molly.
- Fire escape.

1024
01:52:30,253 --> 01:52:32,791
What's happening to me?

1025
01:52:36,885 --> 01:52:38,344
Molly?

1026
01:52:48,981 --> 01:52:50,938
Molly.

1027
01:53:05,998 --> 01:53:07,907
Come on.

1028
01:53:11,128 --> 01:53:13,120
Look.

1029
01:53:13,338 --> 01:53:14,714
Let's go.

1030
01:53:25,434 --> 01:53:28,221
- Molly.
- Get away from us, Carl.

1031
01:53:32,316 --> 01:53:35,233
- Molly.
- You're just a liar.

1032
01:53:35,444 --> 01:53:38,065
This woman's a thief.
She's a con artist.

1033
01:53:38,280 --> 01:53:40,735
Why are you doing this?

1034
01:53:42,826 --> 01:53:44,486
Stop.

1035
01:53:44,703 --> 01:53:47,906
Get away from us.
I've called the police.

1036
01:53:57,424 --> 01:53:59,002
Shit.

1037
01:54:00,927 --> 01:54:04,546
- Carl, why are you doing this?
- She's a thief.

1038
01:54:07,267 --> 01:54:09,758
Just give me the cheque.

1039
01:54:09,978 --> 01:54:12,932
Stay out of this, Molly.

1040
01:54:21,615 --> 01:54:23,654
Get off me.

1041
01:54:28,872 --> 01:54:30,865
Where is it?

1042
01:54:31,083 --> 01:54:34,249
- Where is it, goddammit?
- I gave it away.

1043
01:54:34,461 --> 01:54:38,755
You're lying to me.
Don't lie to me, goddammit.

1044
01:54:41,093 --> 01:54:43,762
The cheque.

1045
01:54:54,982 --> 01:54:58,397
I'll kill her, Sam.
I swear to God, I'll kill her.

1046
01:55:08,578 --> 01:55:11,283
Just give me the cheque, Sam.

1047
01:55:11,498 --> 01:55:15,081
I promise you I'll let her go
if you just give it to me.

1048
01:56:38,752 --> 01:56:40,127
Sam?

1049
01:56:42,673 --> 01:56:44,167
Carl...

1050
01:56:44,633 --> 01:56:46,376
What?

1051
01:57:53,702 --> 01:57:56,074
Are you two all right?

1052
01:57:59,374 --> 01:58:01,201
Sam?

1053
01:58:03,503 --> 01:58:05,046
Molly?

1054
01:58:07,257 --> 01:58:09,629
I can hear you.

1055
01:58:45,337 --> 01:58:47,080
Oh, God.

1056
01:59:34,678 --> 01:59:36,172
Sam?

1057
01:59:36,388 --> 01:59:38,879
They're waiting for you.

1058
01:59:49,943 --> 01:59:51,983
I'll miss you.

1059
01:59:52,863 --> 01:59:55,021
Your mother'd be proud.

1060
01:59:55,991 --> 02:00:00,534
I'm going to miss you too, Sam.
You're all right.

1061
02:00:02,164 --> 02:00:04,287
Bye, Oda Mae.

1062
02:00:04,499 --> 02:00:06,575
Bye, Sam.

1063
02:00:29,358 --> 02:00:31,813
I love you, Molly.

1064
02:00:33,153 --> 02:00:35,311
I've always loved you.

1065
02:00:42,287 --> 02:00:44,363
Ditto.

1066
02:01:04,643 --> 02:01:07,478
It's amazing, Molly.

1067
02:01:07,688 --> 02:01:11,057
The love inside - you take it with you.

1068
02:01:23,328 --> 02:01:25,368
See you.

1069
02:01:32,170 --> 02:01:34,128
See you.

1070
02:01:52,232 --> 02:01:53,561
Bye.

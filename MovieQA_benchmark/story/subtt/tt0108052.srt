28
00:05:16,974 --> 00:05:19,947
Let's get together,
please.

29
00:05:20,043 --> 00:05:22,728
Smile. Good.

30
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:54,281
Yes, sir.

31
00:05:54,378 --> 00:05:57,831
Bring them over
a round of drinks.

32
00:05:57,926 --> 00:06:03,106
Very good, sir. And who
shall I say th-they are from?

33
00:06:03,201 --> 00:06:06,079
You can say
they are from me.

34
00:06:25,452 --> 00:06:29,192
From the gentleman.
Where?

35
00:06:34,083 --> 00:06:36,768
Do you know him?

36
00:06:36,803 --> 00:06:39,454
Find out who he is.

37
00:06:39,489 --> 00:06:41,275
Yes, sir.

38
00:06:44,058 --> 00:06:46,359
Agnieszka, I would
give anything...

39
00:06:46,455 --> 00:06:48,434
to hear you
sing tonight.

40
00:06:48,469 --> 00:06:50,771
But I know you won't.

41
00:06:52,209 --> 00:06:54,895
You embarrass me.

42
00:07:03,047 --> 00:07:05,061
What's he doing?

43
00:07:07,363 --> 00:07:09,280
Stay here.

44
00:07:12,638 --> 00:07:14,520
How are you doing?

45
00:07:14,555 --> 00:07:18,679
You'd leave a woman alone at
the table in a place like this?

46
00:07:18,775 --> 00:07:21,557
Sweetheart, you're the
picture of loneliness.

47
00:07:21,592 --> 00:07:23,475
Oh.

48
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:26,831
Mmm, what a lovely fragrance.
You are breaking my heart.

49
00:07:26,928 --> 00:07:29,421
An extra chair, please.
Vodka for my friend.

50
00:07:29,517 --> 00:07:31,915
And for the lady?
Pernod.

Thank you. I'll tell you
what I mean by cooperative.

63
00:08:13,347 --> 00:08:16,607
Two days after the law is passed
that allJews have to wear the star,

64
00:08:16,642 --> 00:08:18,717
theJewish tailors are turning
them out by the gross...

65
00:08:18,813 --> 00:08:21,114
in a variety of fabrics
at three zloty each.

66
00:08:21,211 --> 00:08:23,033
Tell me about
your cellar wines.

67
00:08:23,129 --> 00:08:26,486
I have an excellent German
Riesling. 1937. Mmm, French.

68
00:08:26,581 --> 00:08:29,170
A Bordeaux. Chateau Latour,
'28, '29? No, I'm sorry.

69
00:08:29,267 --> 00:08:31,569
It's as if they have no idea
what kind of law it is.

70
00:08:31,664 --> 00:08:34,542
As if it's the emblem
of a riding club.

71
00:08:34,637 --> 00:08:36,652
A Margaux, '29? No,
no, we don't have that.

72
00:08:36,747 --> 00:08:38,953
Burgundy then? A
Romanee-Conti, '37? Yes.

73
00:08:39,049 --> 00:08:41,830
It's human nature.
"We'll do this to avoid that. "

74
00:08:41,927 --> 00:08:44,036
That's what they have done
since thousands of years.

75
00:08:44,071 --> 00:08:46,243
It's what they do.
They weather the storm.

76
00:08:46,338 --> 00:08:50,175
But this storm is different. This is
not the Romans. This storm is the SS.

77
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:53,962

Who is that man?

88
00:09:25,947 --> 00:09:30,071

94
00:10:21,477 --> 00:10:23,361
An alleJuden!

95
00:10:23,396 --> 00:10:27,136
Ab sofort ist es allen Juden
untersagt...

96
00:10:27,231 --> 00:10:31,163
Fleisch aufkoscher Art
zuzubereiten.

97
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:34,425
Meldung an alleJuden.
Ab sofort-

98
00:10:53,222 --> 00:10:55,141
Rabbi
- Private property cannot be confiscated.

99
00:10:55,236 --> 00:10:57,059
How long are the schools going
to be closed? I do not know.

100
00:10:57,154 --> 00:10:59,695
Pillage is formally prohibited.
You don't know anything!

101
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:02,202
I am familiar with the
Hague Convention. Religious-

102
00:11:02,237 --> 00:11:06,361
They come into our house and tell
us we don't live there anymore.

103
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:08,903
It now belongs
to a certain SS officer.

104
00:11:08,938 --> 00:11:11,314
Please. I only know
what they tell me.

105
00:11:11,349 --> 00:11:14,514
And what they tell me
changes from day to day.

106
00:11:14,609 --> 00:11:17,583
Aren't you supposed
to be able to help?

107
00:11:17,679 --> 00:11:20,616
I mean, what if I just
took this thing off?

108
00:11:20,651 --> 00:11:23,337
What are they going to do
about it? They will shoot you.

109
00:11:23,433 --> 00:11:27,366
Why don't you stop this
silly talk? Itzhak Stern!

110
00:11:27,401 --> 00:11:30,530
I'm looking
for Itzhak Stern.

111
00:11:32,256 --> 00:11:35,181
Are you Itzhak Stern
or not?

112
00:11:35,216 --> 00:11:38,106
I am.
Where can we talk?

113
00:11:47,313 --> 00:11:51,150
There's a company you did the
books for on Lipowa Street.

114
00:11:51,185 --> 00:11:53,512
Made what?
Pots and pans?

115
00:11:53,547 --> 00:11:56,520
By law, I have to tell you,
sir, I'm a Jew.

116
00:11:56,617 --> 00:12:00,357
Well, I'm a German.
So there we are.

117
00:12:03,043 --> 00:12:06,591
A good company, you
think? Modestly successful.

118
00:12:06,687 --> 00:12:09,180
I know nothing about enamelware. Do you?

119
00:12:09,277 --> 00:12:11,578
I was just
the accountant.

120
00:12:11,674 --> 00:12:13,976
Simple engineering though,
wouldn't you think?

121
00:12:14,072 --> 00:12:15,894
Change the machines around,
whatever you do,

122
00:12:15,929 --> 00:12:19,028
you could make other
things, couldn't you?

123
00:12:19,063 --> 00:12:22,128
Field kits, mess kits.
Army contracts.

124
00:12:23,854 --> 00:12:26,635
Once the war ends, forget
it, but for now it's great.

125
00:12:26,732 --> 00:12:28,806
You can make a fortune,
don't you think?

126
00:12:28,841 --> 00:12:32,102
I think most people right now
have other priorities.

127
00:12:32,198 --> 00:12:34,979
Like what?

128
00:12:35,075 --> 00:12:37,377
I'm sure you'll do just fine
once you get the contracts.

129
00:12:37,472 --> 00:12:39,452
In fact, the worse things get,
the better you'll do.

130
00:12:39,487 --> 00:12:42,844
Oh, well, I can get the signatures
I need. That's the easy part.

131
00:12:42,939 --> 00:12:46,488
Finding the money to buy
the company, that's hard.

132
00:12:46,584 --> 00:12:48,406
You don't have
any money?

133
00:12:48,502 --> 00:12:52,434
Not that kind of money.
You know anybody?

134
00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:55,312
Jews, yeah.

135
00:12:55,407 --> 00:12:58,188
Investors. You must
have contacts...

136
00:12:58,285 --> 00:13:00,107
in theJewish business
community working here.

137
00:13:00,203 --> 00:13:03,032
What community? Jews can
no longer own businesses.

138
00:13:03,067 --> 00:13:05,862
That's why this one's
in receivership. But they

139
00:13:05,957 --> 00:13:08,643
I'd own it. I'd pay them back in product
- pots and pans.

140
00:13:08,678 --> 00:13:11,058
Pots and pans. Something they can use.

141
00:13:11,093 --> 00:13:13,403
Something they can
feel in their hands.

142
00:13:13,438 --> 00:13:15,643
They can trade it on the black
market, do whatever they want.

143
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:18,042
Everybody's happy.

144
00:13:19,576 --> 00:13:22,357
If you want, you could
run the company for me.

145
00:13:26,098 --> 00:13:28,400
Let me understand.

146
00:13:28,495 --> 00:13:31,420
They'd put up all the money,
I'd do all the work.

147
00:13:31,455 --> 00:13:34,345
What, if you don't mind
my asking, would you do?

148
00:13:34,441 --> 00:13:36,743
I'd make sure it's known
the company's in business.

149
00:13:36,778 --> 00:13:38,948
I'd see that it had
a certain panache.

150
00:13:39,045 --> 00:13:42,690
That's what I'm good at,
not the work. Not the work.

151
00:13:42,725 --> 00:13:45,087
The presentation.

152
00:14:02,447 --> 00:14:06,569
I'm sure I don't know anybody
who'll be interested in this.

153
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:10,790
Well, they should be,
Itzhak Stern.

154
00:14:10,886 --> 00:14:14,530
Tell them they should be.

155
00:14:23,353 --> 00:14:26,039
Achtung! Achtung!

156
00:14:26,134 --> 00:14:31,793
An alleJuden...
Ab sofort ist es verboten-

157
00:14:31,889 --> 00:14:36,301
Vere dignum et justum est,
aequum et salutare,

158
00:14:36,336 --> 00:14:40,616
nos tibi semper et
ubique gratias agere,

159
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:43,878
Domine Sancte, Pater Omnipotens,
Aeterne Deus.

160
00:14:43,974 --> 00:14:47,331
I've got a client who'll sell
marks for zloty at 2.45 to 1.

161
00:14:47,426 --> 00:14:49,488
Wool, mink collar.
It's a nice coat.

162
00:14:49,523 --> 00:14:51,515
She'll trade it
for ration coupons.

163
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:54,871
Wicks, for lamps. You
have a truckload of wicks?

164
00:14:54,906 --> 00:14:58,935
What am I going to do with a truckload
of wicks? Nine by 12, nine by 14.

165
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:01,908
I don't know.
Big, beautiful, Persian.

166
00:15:02,004 --> 00:15:04,785
Lumen aeternum mundo effudit-

167
00:15:04,881 --> 00:15:07,183
Psst.
What?

168
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:09,101
You don't recognize this?
It's shoe polish.

169
00:15:09,197 --> 00:15:11,499
In metal containers? You
asked for shoe polish.

170
00:15:11,595 --> 00:15:13,801
In metal containers. This is
glass. In metal containers.

171
00:15:13,836 --> 00:15:15,736
It's not what I asked
for. What's the difference?

172
00:15:15,771 --> 00:15:17,636
What's the difference?
What's the difference?

173
00:15:17,671 --> 00:15:19,651
Shh.!
My client sold it

174
00:15:19,746 --> 00:15:21,569
who sold it
to the German Army.

175
00:15:21,761 --> 00:15:25,885
Only by the time it got there, because of
the freezing cold, it broke. All 10,000 units.

176
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,091
Mmm, ooh, ooh, ooh.
This is not my problem.

177
00:15:28,186 --> 00:15:30,104
This is not his problem.
This is not your problem?

178
00:15:30,139 --> 00:15:32,598
This is not my problem. All right.

179
00:15:32,694 --> 00:15:36,434
The German Army wants to
find out where it came from.

180
00:15:36,530 --> 00:15:39,792
I am going to make sure they
find out. Now it's your problem.

181
00:15:39,827 --> 00:15:42,860
You be quiet!

182
00:15:42,956 --> 00:15:45,546
Metal
containers.

183
00:15:45,642 --> 00:15:48,292
Hello.

184
00:15:48,327 --> 00:15:52,259
Pardon me for interfering,
but that's a nice shirt.

185
00:15:52,294 --> 00:15:54,526
Nice shirt.

186
00:15:54,561 --> 00:15:57,725
Do you know where I can
find a nice shirt like that?

187
00:15:59,644 --> 00:16:03,480
...laudare, benedicere
et predicare.

188
00:16:05,206 --> 00:16:07,029
Like this?

189
00:16:07,124 --> 00:16:10,002
It's illegal to buy or sell
anything on the street.

190
00:16:10,097 --> 00:16:13,263
We don't do that.
We're here to pray.

191
00:16:15,277 --> 00:16:17,866
Jesum Christum Dominum Nostrum-

192
00:16:17,962 --> 00:16:22,662
Do you have any idea how much a shirt
like this costs? Nice things cost money.

193
00:16:22,697 --> 00:16:26,786
...adorant Dominationes,
tremunt Potestates.

194
00:16:26,881 --> 00:16:32,061
Coeli coelorumque
virtutes ac Beata Seraphim...

195
00:16:32,156 --> 00:16:35,225
socia exultatione
concelebrant-

196
00:16:35,321 --> 00:16:37,623
How many?

197
00:16:37,718 --> 00:16:41,460
I'm going to need some other
things, too, as things come up.

198
00:16:41,555 --> 00:16:45,583
This won't be a problem.
From time to time.

199
00:16:45,871 --> 00:16:48,556
Achtung! Achtung!

200
00:17:28,549 --> 00:17:31,810
- Name? Adresse?
- Formular ausfuellen!

201
00:17:31,845 --> 00:17:34,208

208
00:18:39,424 --> 00:18:43,069
This is obviously the right place.
How are you doing? Herr Schindler.

209
00:18:47,193 --> 00:18:51,125
Good-bye,Jews.!
Good-bye,Jews.!

210
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:55,057
Good-bye,Jews!
Good-bye,Jews!

211

Good-bye,Jews.!

212
00:18:59,181 --> 00:19:03,784
Good-bye,Jews.!
Good-bye,Jews.!

213
00:19:07,045 --> 00:19:09,634
This iz the vechteka, Moyshe. Ojciec.

214
00:19:09,669 --> 00:19:12,607
Nyne, this kan
neash zyane.

215
00:19:22,198 --> 00:19:25,843
Oh, my God.

216
00:19:25,939 --> 00:19:29,199
Oy, God.
Oh, my God.

217
00:19:35,817 --> 00:19:38,503
Oh, my God.

218
00:19:44,065 --> 00:19:46,367
It could not be better.

219
00:19:46,462 --> 00:19:50,012
It could be worse.
How? Tell me.

220
00:19:50,107 --> 00:19:52,888
How on earth could it
possibly be worse?

221
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:57,457
Dzien dobry.

222
00:19:57,492 --> 00:19:59,793
Dzien dobry.
Dzien dobry.

223
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:01,581
Dzien dobry.

224
00:20:01,616 --> 00:20:04,014
Dzien dobry.
Dzien dobry.

225
00:20:06,891 --> 00:20:09,192
Hey, Goldberg.
Poldek.

226
00:20:09,289 --> 00:20:13,413
What's this? Uh, the Judenrat
has its own police now.

227
00:20:13,509 --> 00:20:16,194
You don't say.
Ordnungsdienst.

228
00:20:16,290 --> 00:20:18,687
I'm a policeman now, could you
believe it? It's hard to believe.

229
00:20:18,783 --> 00:20:20,666
Oh, no, it's not hard to believe.

230
00:20:20,701 --> 00:20:23,065
It's a good racket, Poldek.
The only racket here.

231
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:26,840
Look, maybe I could put in a good
word for you with my superiors.

232
00:20:26,875 --> 00:20:30,580
Your superiors? Come on, they
are not as bad as everyone says.

233
00:20:30,676 --> 00:20:33,745
Well, they're worse than everyone
says, but it's a lot of money.

234
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,334
A lot of money.

235
00:20:36,431 --> 00:20:39,020
Give me my
housing assignment.

236
00:20:39,115 --> 00:20:43,336
Come on. You look funny
in that hat, Goldberg.

237
00:20:43,431 --> 00:20:46,692
You look like a clown,
you know?

238
00:20:51,487 --> 00:20:53,754
He's a very important man.

239
00:20:53,789 --> 00:20:55,515
Just give him
two minutes of your time.

240
00:20:55,612 --> 00:20:58,872
Since when did time cost money?
Just sit down and listen.

241
00:20:58,968 --> 00:21:01,078
Please.
Sir?

242
00:21:04,627 --> 00:21:06,641
For each thousand you invest,
I will repay you with...

243
00:21:06,676 --> 00:21:08,751
Two hundred. 200 kilos
of enamelware a month,

244
00:21:08,846 --> 00:21:10,668
to begin in July and to
continue for one year.

245
00:21:10,765 --> 00:21:14,410
After which time, we're even.
That's it. It's very simple.

246
00:21:14,445 --> 00:21:17,286
Not good enough. It's not good enough.

247
00:21:17,321 --> 00:21:19,493
Not good enough?

248
00:21:19,588 --> 00:21:23,520
Look where you're living. Look where
you've been put. "Not good enough. "

249
00:21:23,617 --> 00:21:26,014
A couple of months ago you'd
be right, not anymore.

250
00:21:26,109 --> 00:21:29,082
Money's still money.

251
00:21:30,617 --> 00:21:32,789
No, it is not.

252
00:21:32,824 --> 00:21:34,837
That's why we're here.

253
00:21:34,933 --> 00:21:36,851
Trade goods-
that's the only currency...

254
00:21:36,886 --> 00:21:38,769
that'll be worth
anything in the ghetto.

255
00:21:38,804 --> 00:21:42,031
Things have changed,
my friend.

256
00:21:42,798 --> 00:21:45,099
Did I call
this meeting?

257
00:21:45,195 --> 00:21:47,496
You told Mr. Stern
you wanted to speak to me.

258
00:21:47,593 --> 00:21:50,052
I'm here.
I've made you a fair offer.

259
00:21:50,087 --> 00:21:53,922
Fair would be
a percentage in the company.

260
00:21:54,019 --> 00:21:57,087
Forget the whole thing.

261
00:21:57,183 --> 00:21:59,389
Get out.

262
00:22:03,418 --> 00:22:06,390
How do we know that you
will do what you say?

263
00:22:06,425 --> 00:22:08,274
Because I said I would.

264
00:22:08,309 --> 00:22:10,514
You want a contract?
To be upheld by what court?

265
00:22:10,549 --> 00:22:13,392
I said what I'll do.
That's our contract.

266
00:22:16,652 --> 00:22:18,762
...mielismy racje.

267
00:22:29,983 --> 00:22:35,162
Piec, szesc, siedem...

268
00:22:35,258 --> 00:22:38,711
osiem, dziewiec.

269
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:53,864
The standard SS rate for Jewish
skilled labor is seven marks a day,

270
00:22:53,899 --> 00:22:56,741
five for unskilled
and women.

271
00:22:56,838 --> 00:22:59,714
This is what you pay
the Reich Economic Office.

272
00:22:59,811 --> 00:23:02,208
TheJews themselves
receive nothing.

273
00:23:02,303 --> 00:23:06,524
Poles you pay wages. Generally,
they get a little more.

274
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:09,113
Are you listening? What
was that about the SS?

275
00:23:09,209 --> 00:23:11,320
The rate? The what?

276
00:23:11,415 --> 00:23:14,868
TheJewish worker's salary
- you pay it directly to the SS, not to the worker.

277
00:23:14,963 --> 00:23:16,942
He gets nothing.
But it's less.

278
00:23:16,977 --> 00:23:18,992
It's less than what I
would pay a Pole. It's less.

279
00:23:19,087 --> 00:23:21,868
That's the point
I'm trying to make.

280
00:23:21,965 --> 00:23:24,459
Poles cost more.

281
00:23:24,554 --> 00:23:28,966
Why should I hire Poles?

282
00:23:29,062 --> 00:23:32,802
An enamelware factory
over at, uh, Lipowa Street.

283
00:23:32,898 --> 00:23:35,679
It, uh, it, um-
It's owned by a German.

284
00:23:35,775 --> 00:23:38,749
But it's outside the ghetto, so
you can barter for extra goods-

285
00:23:38,784 --> 00:23:40,954
for eggs, I don't know
what you need-

286
00:23:41,050 --> 00:23:43,030
with the Polish workers.
You can't get it here.

287
00:23:43,065 --> 00:23:47,188
Also, he's asking for ten healthy women for the
- I am healthy.

288
00:23:47,284 --> 00:23:50,161
Bring your sister, okay?

289
00:23:54,285 --> 00:23:56,587
Chodz.

290
00:23:56,683 --> 00:23:59,944
You need to convince them you have a
trade, something valuable to the war effort.

291
00:24:00,039 --> 00:24:02,149
Like what? What if you
don't? I'm a musician.

292
00:24:02,246 --> 00:24:05,698
Your name goes on a list.
And they put you on trucks-

293
00:24:05,794 --> 00:24:07,808
No, no, no, that's not
true. You're a musician?

294
00:24:07,903 --> 00:24:10,302
Yeah. I'd fid a good
hiding place if I were you.

295
00:24:10,397 --> 00:24:14,713
I'm not going to hide like some
animal. There are places to hide.

296
00:24:19,125 --> 00:24:20,947
Der Naechste.!

297
00:24:21,044 --> 00:24:24,269
I'm a graduate
of the University of Lwow.

298
00:24:24,304 --> 00:24:27,470
I used to work at the
hydroelectric station in Roznow-

299
00:24:27,565 --> 00:24:29,387
Blauschein.

300
00:24:32,552 --> 00:24:36,293
I'm gonna get the necessary papers
because this card is no good anymore.

301
00:24:36,388 --> 00:24:38,690
You can stay in this line all
day, you'll still get one of these.

302
00:24:38,786 --> 00:24:42,334
They are no good. You'll
have to leave the line now,

303
00:24:42,431 --> 00:24:46,842
then you'll get a blue card, a Blauschein,
to say that you are an essential worker.

304
00:24:46,938 --> 00:24:49,911
I'll get these papers
for you at Pankiewicz.

305
00:24:49,946 --> 00:24:51,829
Pharmacist.
Just there, look.

306
00:24:51,925 --> 00:24:53,748
Guess who is here?

307
00:24:53,843 --> 00:24:56,432
Poldek! Enjoying
the weather, Poldek?

308
00:24:56,529 --> 00:24:59,371
Enjoying the lines?
Need some shoe polish?

309
00:24:59,406 --> 00:25:01,864
In a metal container
maybe?

310
00:25:01,899 --> 00:25:06,215
Not essential? I think you
misunderstand the meaning of the word.

311
00:25:06,311 --> 00:25:09,092
No Blauschein, sir.
Stand over there.

312
00:25:09,189 --> 00:25:11,873
Move. Next!

313
00:25:11,970 --> 00:25:14,080
What do you mean,
"Not essential"?

314
00:25:14,175 --> 00:25:19,642
I teach history and literature.
Since when is not essential?

315
00:25:24,725 --> 00:25:27,027
He's a metal polisher.

316
00:25:33,644 --> 00:25:36,330
It was not right? It's very
good. He's 53 years old.

317
00:25:36,426 --> 00:25:39,399
It's too new. Mmm. Thank you.

318
00:25:47,263 --> 00:25:49,661
You're crazy. You
left it in your drawer.

319
00:25:49,696 --> 00:25:51,866
How many times
have I told you?

320
00:25:51,963 --> 00:25:54,552
Your work certificate you keep
in your pocket at all times.

321
00:25:54,648 --> 00:25:56,470
And you leave everything
in your drawer.

322
00:25:56,567 --> 00:25:58,868
How many times I've told you?

323
00:25:58,964 --> 00:26:02,032
I'm a metal polisher.

324
00:26:10,473 --> 00:26:12,966
Take the round sheet of tin,

325
00:26:13,062 --> 00:26:16,803
dip it in soap emulsion.

326
00:26:16,898 --> 00:26:21,789
Then place it centrally
in the press.

327
00:26:36,368 --> 00:26:39,628
We obtain the soup pot.
The soup pot.

328
00:26:39,724 --> 00:26:42,984
Soup pot.

329
00:26:43,081 --> 00:26:46,054
Grosz, Mrs. Grosz,
stay together.

330
00:26:50,178 --> 00:26:55,165
Sir, I have ten work permits here
for the Deutsche Emailwarenfabrik,

331
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,911
cosigned by Mr. Bankier
and myself.

332
00:26:57,946 --> 00:27:02,454
If it's carbonized,
clean it with a file.

333
00:27:02,549 --> 00:27:07,153
But don't touch both the
electrodes at the same time.

334
00:27:07,188 --> 00:27:10,223
You'll get electrocuted.
Here, have a try.

335
00:27:14,442 --> 00:27:16,744
Roll the metal
under the press,

336
00:27:16,839 --> 00:27:19,141
but be very careful
unless you want your fingers...

337
00:27:19,238 --> 00:27:21,923
to become part
of the teapot.

338
00:27:23,457 --> 00:27:27,006
Occupation? I'm a
writer. I play the flute.

339
00:27:27,041 --> 00:27:30,327
But Moses is
a skilled metalworker.

340
00:27:30,362 --> 00:27:32,569
He can make tin pots.
He can make tanks.

341
00:27:32,664 --> 00:27:34,487
He can make whatever
Mr. Schindler asks.

342
00:27:34,583 --> 00:27:37,076
He's highly skilled.
Give him your card.

343
00:27:37,111 --> 00:27:39,377
Moses, give him your card.

344
00:27:41,392 --> 00:27:43,598
Now, dip the basin
with the tongs...

345
00:27:43,694 --> 00:27:46,092
into the enamel solution.

346
00:27:48,105 --> 00:27:52,326
And after swiveling it around,
carefully place it aside to drip dry.

347
00:27:55,202 --> 00:27:58,560
And whatever he asks you, allow me
just to represent you and speak for you.

348
00:27:58,655 --> 00:28:00,574
Don't say a word.

349
00:28:00,669 --> 00:28:04,027
Filing, billing, keeping track
of my appointments, shorthand.

350
00:28:04,062 --> 00:28:08,149
Typing, obviously. How is
your typing? Uh, all right.

351
00:28:08,246 --> 00:28:10,068
Please.

352
00:29:00,802 --> 00:29:04,317
You need a secretary.
Pick one.

353
00:29:04,352 --> 00:29:09,146
I don't know how. They're
all so... qualified.

354
00:29:09,181 --> 00:29:12,024
You have to choose.

355
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:16,915
Prosze sie ladnie usmiechac.
Big smile. Big smile.

356
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:18,354
Uwaga.

357
00:29:37,056 --> 00:29:39,837
If you would,
look after my guest.

358
00:29:39,932 --> 00:29:44,488
Um, boxed teas are good.
Coffiee, pate, um...

359
00:29:44,523 --> 00:29:49,044
kielbasa sausage, cheeses,
Beluga caviar. Yes.

360
00:29:49,139 --> 00:29:50,866
And, of course, who could live
without German cigarettes?

361
00:29:50,962 --> 00:29:53,071
Get me as many
as you can fid.

362
00:29:53,168 --> 00:29:55,182
And some more fresh fruit.

363
00:29:55,278 --> 00:29:57,928
The real rarities-
oranges, lemons, pineapples.

364
00:29:57,963 --> 00:30:00,613
I need several boxes of
Cuban cigars. The best. Yes.

365
00:30:00,648 --> 00:30:04,293
And dark, unsweetened chocolate. Not in
the shape ofladyfigers, the chunk chocolate.

366
00:30:04,389 --> 00:30:07,361
Yes. Big as my hand, you
sample at wine tastings.

367
00:30:07,458 --> 00:30:10,526
We're going to need lots
of cognac. The best, Hennessy.

368
00:30:10,623 --> 00:30:15,801
Dom Perignon champagne.
Um, get L 'espadon sardines...

369
00:30:15,898 --> 00:30:18,775
and, oh,
try to fid nylon stockings.

370
00:30:21,172 --> 00:30:24,242
It is my distinct pleasure
to announce...

371
00:30:24,337 --> 00:30:29,708
the fully operational status
of Deutsche Email Fabrik...

372
00:30:29,804 --> 00:30:31,015
Patrzjakies szmaty.!

373
00:30:31,050 --> 00:30:35,366
manufacturers of superior
enamelware crockery...

374
00:30:35,401 --> 00:30:39,682
expressly designed
and crafted for military use.

375
00:30:39,717 --> 00:30:42,272
Utilizing only
the most modern equipment,

376
00:30:42,368 --> 00:30:47,259
D.E.F. 's staffi of highly-skilled and
experienced artisans andjourneymen...

377
00:30:47,294 --> 00:30:50,712
deliver a product
of unparalleled quality,

378
00:30:50,807 --> 00:30:54,548
enabling me to proffier, with
absolute confidence and pride,

379
00:30:54,644 --> 00:30:57,138
a full line
of field and kitchenware...

380
00:30:57,233 --> 00:31:01,165
unsurpassable in all respects
by my competitors.

381
00:31:01,262 --> 00:31:03,755
See attached list
and available colors.

382
00:31:03,851 --> 00:31:08,454
Anticipating the enclosed bids
will meet with your approval.

383
00:31:08,550 --> 00:31:12,194
Made in Havana, Cuba. Looking forward to
a long and mutually prosperous association.

384
00:31:12,291 --> 00:31:15,360
Look at this. I extend to you in
advance my sincerest gratitude...

385
00:31:15,455 --> 00:31:18,236
and very best regards.
Oskar Schindler.

386
00:31:18,333 --> 00:31:21,593
Yeah, I need 700 gross
from here for next Thursday.

387
00:31:21,689 --> 00:31:24,340
Nine hundred
- No, make it ten for Wednesday.

388
00:31:24,375 --> 00:31:28,115
All this stuff here goes to Madritsch's
factory on Tuesday of next week.

389
00:31:43,268 --> 00:31:46,529
My father was fond of saying,
"You need three things in life

390
00:31:46,625 --> 00:31:50,557
"a good doctor,
a forgiving priest...

391
00:31:50,653 --> 00:31:53,723
and a clever accountant. "

392
00:31:56,983 --> 00:32:00,915
The first two...
I've never had much use for.

393
00:32:01,011 --> 00:32:04,271
But the third-

394
00:32:09,355 --> 00:32:12,711
Just pretend,
for Christ's sake.

395
00:32:16,261 --> 00:32:19,329
Is that all?

396
00:32:23,933 --> 00:32:27,001
I'm trying to thank you.

397
00:32:27,098 --> 00:32:31,125
I'm saying I couldn't
have done this without you.

398
00:32:33,524 --> 00:32:36,305
The usual thing would be
to acknowledge my gratitude.

399
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:41,101
It would also, by the way,
be the courteous thing.

400
00:32:41,136 --> 00:32:43,882
You're welcome.

401
00:32:52,417 --> 00:32:54,527
Get out of here.

402
00:33:07,379 --> 00:33:10,447
Klonowska, who is it?

403
00:33:19,367 --> 00:33:21,956
She's so embarrassed.
Look at her.

404
00:33:33,465 --> 00:33:35,671
You know something?
You would like her.

405
00:33:35,767 --> 00:33:37,589
Oskar, please.
What?

406
00:33:37,684 --> 00:33:39,986
I don't have to like her... just
because you do. You would, though.

407
00:33:40,083 --> 00:33:42,767
It doesn't
work that way.

408
00:33:54,948 --> 00:33:57,729
You've done well here.

409
00:34:00,032 --> 00:34:02,524
You look wonderful.

410
00:34:05,305 --> 00:34:08,663
Be careful of the step,
miss. Mrs. Schindler, Marek.

411
00:34:20,843 --> 00:34:24,644
It's not a charade,
all this? How could it

412
00:34:24,679 --> 00:34:27,796
The clothes, the car, the
apartment. Wait a minute.

413
00:34:27,831 --> 00:34:30,878
Take a guess how many people
are on my payroll. Oskar.

414
00:34:30,913 --> 00:34:36,476
My father, at the height of his
success, had 50. I've got 350.

415
00:34:36,511 --> 00:34:40,600
350 workers on the factory
floor, with one purpose.

416
00:34:40,695 --> 00:34:42,805
To make pots and pans?

417
00:34:42,902 --> 00:34:46,737
To make money.
For me.

418
00:34:52,204 --> 00:34:55,274
Does anyone
ask about me?

419
00:34:56,712 --> 00:34:59,781
Back home?
Everybody.

420
00:34:59,877 --> 00:35:02,658
All the time.

421
00:35:02,754 --> 00:35:05,884
Hmm.

422
00:35:05,919 --> 00:35:11,289
They won't soon forget the name
Schindler here, I can tell you that.

423
00:35:12,728 --> 00:35:15,798
"Oskar Schindler,"
they'll say.

424
00:35:15,893 --> 00:35:19,154
"Everybody
remembers him.

425
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:23,470
"He did something
extraordinary.

426
00:35:23,565 --> 00:35:28,457
"He did something
no one else did.

427
00:35:28,553 --> 00:35:31,718
"He came here
with nothing-

428
00:35:31,813 --> 00:35:34,594
"a suitcase-

429
00:35:34,691 --> 00:35:40,061
"and built a bankrupt company
into a major manufactory.

430
00:35:40,096 --> 00:35:43,514
"And left with
a steamer trunk-

431
00:35:43,611 --> 00:35:48,022
"Two steamer trunks
full of money,

432
00:35:48,118 --> 00:35:52,242
all the riches
of the world. "

433
00:35:52,277 --> 00:35:54,124
Hmm.

434
00:35:54,159 --> 00:35:57,325
It's comforting to see
that nothing's changed.

435
00:35:57,421 --> 00:36:00,839
You're wrong, Emilie.

436
00:36:00,874 --> 00:36:03,271
There's no way I could have
known this before,

437
00:36:03,306 --> 00:36:06,593
but there was always
something missing.

438
00:36:06,628 --> 00:36:10,560
In every business I tried, I can
see now, it wasn't me that failed.

439
00:36:10,656 --> 00:36:13,306
Something was missing.

440
00:36:13,341 --> 00:36:16,794
Even if I'd known what it was, there's
nothing I could have done about it...

441
00:36:16,889 --> 00:36:21,301
because you can't
create this thing.

442
00:36:21,398 --> 00:36:26,480
And it makes all the difference in
the world between success and failure.

443
00:36:26,515 --> 00:36:28,974
Luck?

444
00:36:31,276 --> 00:36:34,057
War.

445
00:36:56,595 --> 00:37:00,143
Should I stay?

446
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:04,808
It's a beautiful city.

447
00:37:04,843 --> 00:37:09,638
I asked you
if I should stay.

448
00:37:09,673 --> 00:37:12,611
It's up to you.

449
00:37:16,352 --> 00:37:20,764
Promise me, Oskar, no doorman
or maitre d' will ever presume...

450
00:37:20,859 --> 00:37:26,039
I'm anyone other than Mrs.
Schindler, and I'll stay.

451
00:37:28,148 --> 00:37:30,354
Good-bye, darling.

452
00:37:46,275 --> 00:37:50,303
I could try to read this or I could
eat my lunch while it's still hot.

453
00:37:50,399 --> 00:37:52,317
We're doing well?

454
00:37:52,412 --> 00:37:53,563
Yes. Better this month than last?

455
00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:55,865
Yes. Any reason to think next month

456
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:59,030
The war could end.

457
00:38:08,525 --> 00:38:10,983
What? There is a machinist outside...

458
00:38:11,018 --> 00:38:13,992
who'd like to thank you
personally for giving him a job.

459
00:38:14,087 --> 00:38:18,595
Every day he comes. He's very
grateful. It'll just take a minute.

460
00:38:24,637 --> 00:38:26,939
Mr. Lowenstein?

461
00:38:33,652 --> 00:38:36,590
I want to thank you, sir,

462
00:38:36,625 --> 00:38:39,311
for giving me
the opportunity to work.

463
00:38:39,406 --> 00:38:42,189
You're welcome. I'm sure
you're doing a great job.

464
00:38:42,284 --> 00:38:46,408
The SS beat me up.
They would have killed me,

465
00:38:46,504 --> 00:38:51,012
but I am essential to the
war effort, thanks to you.

466
00:38:51,047 --> 00:38:52,894
That's great.

467
00:38:52,929 --> 00:38:55,485
I work hard for you.

468
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:59,452
I'm sure you do. I'll
continue to work hard for you.

469
00:38:59,547 --> 00:39:01,369
That's great.
Thanks.

470
00:39:01,465 --> 00:39:03,863
God bless you, sir.
All right.

471
00:39:03,898 --> 00:39:07,508
You are a good man.

472
00:39:08,850 --> 00:39:11,727
He saved my life.
Yes, he did.

473
00:39:11,762 --> 00:39:14,604
God bless him. Yeah. Come on.

474
00:39:16,523 --> 00:39:19,304
God bless you.

475
00:39:30,813 --> 00:39:33,594
I'm sorry, Herr Direktor,
but you're running very late.

476
00:39:33,689 --> 00:39:36,820
This is for the
Obersturmbannfuehrer, sir.

477
00:39:36,855 --> 00:39:39,697
And this is for his niece,
Greta. It's her birthday.

478
00:39:39,732 --> 00:39:42,417
Greta as in Garbo. By the way,
don't ever do that to me again.

479
00:39:42,514 --> 00:39:44,972
Go. Go, go, drive!
Don't bow.

480
00:39:45,007 --> 00:39:48,843
Did you happen to notice that
that man had one arm? What? Did he?

481
00:39:52,392 --> 00:39:54,885
What's his use?
Very useful.

482
00:39:57,475 --> 00:40:01,023
How?
Very useful! Success!

483
00:40:08,408 --> 00:40:13,108
##Achrar kach loe nedah ##

484
00:40:27,781 --> 00:40:30,815
Besen und Schaufeln
werden ausgeladen...

485
00:40:30,850 --> 00:40:33,440
jeder nimmt sich eine und dann
wird die Strasse gereinigt.

486
00:40:33,535 --> 00:40:35,646
We'll be late for work.

487
00:40:47,442 --> 00:40:50,380
You shouldn't think of them
as yours, Oskar.

488
00:40:50,415 --> 00:40:52,333
You need to understand that
some of the officers here...

489
00:40:52,368 --> 00:40:55,019
don't give a damn
about production.

490
00:40:55,114 --> 00:40:59,046
To them, it's a matter of,
um, national priority...

491
00:40:59,081 --> 00:41:01,313
thatJews
be made to shovel snow.

492
00:41:01,348 --> 00:41:03,842
It's got nothing to do
with reality, Oskar.

493
00:41:03,877 --> 00:41:05,856
You know it and I know it.

494
00:41:05,952 --> 00:41:08,158
Jews shoveling snow-

495
00:41:08,253 --> 00:41:12,762
It's got a, um,
ritual significance.

496
00:41:14,296 --> 00:41:17,652
Come with me.
I am an essential worker.

497
00:41:17,749 --> 00:41:20,338
Essential worker?
Yes.

498
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:26,572
I work for Oskar Schindler.
Essential worker for Oskar Schindler.

499
00:41:26,667 --> 00:41:29,928
A one-armed Jew? Twice
as useless! Yes, yes.

500
00:41:30,025 --> 00:41:33,861
I lost a day
of production, Rolf.

501
00:41:33,957 --> 00:41:37,025
I work for Oskar Schindler.

502
00:41:37,122 --> 00:41:40,957
Danka, look at the snow. Look
at the snow. Look at the snow!

503
00:41:43,931 --> 00:41:48,534
I lost a worker.
I expect to be compensated.

504
00:41:48,631 --> 00:41:51,412
File a grievance with the
Economic Office. It's your right.

505
00:41:51,507 --> 00:41:54,098
Would it do any good? Of course not.

506
00:41:56,879 --> 00:42:00,715
A big shot from the SS Budget and
Construction Office came to lunch...

507
00:42:00,750 --> 00:42:04,551
and he told us that to believe
theJewish skilled worker had a place...

508
00:42:04,586 --> 00:42:08,867
in Reich economics
was a treasonable idea.

509
00:42:12,128 --> 00:42:15,676
A one-armed machinist, Oskar?

510
00:42:15,711 --> 00:42:19,225
He was
a metal press operator.

511
00:42:22,965 --> 00:42:25,746
Quite skilled.

512
00:42:53,559 --> 00:42:55,634
Herr Direktor?

513
00:42:55,669 --> 00:42:57,971
Shit.
I don't believe it.

514
00:42:58,006 --> 00:43:00,177
Stern, is that you?

515
00:43:00,273 --> 00:43:04,266
No, it's Poldek.
It's about Stern.

516
00:43:04,301 --> 00:43:08,041
Leave your luggage
on the platform.

517
00:43:08,076 --> 00:43:10,056
Clearly label it.

518
00:43:10,151 --> 00:43:14,179
Given name first,
then your surname.

519
00:43:14,275 --> 00:43:16,769
Do not bring
your baggage with you.

520
00:43:16,864 --> 00:43:19,645
It will follow you later.

521
00:43:19,742 --> 00:43:22,811
Leave your luggage
on the platform.

522
00:43:22,906 --> 00:43:24,825
Clearly label it.

523
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:28,660
Lassen Sie Ihr Gepaeck
am Bahnsteig.

524
00:43:29,524 --> 00:43:31,443
Stern?

525
00:43:33,456 --> 00:43:36,429
He's on the list.
He is?

526
00:43:36,526 --> 00:43:39,307
Well, let's find him. I'm
sorry. You can't have him.

527
00:43:39,402 --> 00:43:42,184
He's on the list. If he were an essential
worker, he would not be on the list.

528
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:44,869
I'm talking to a clerk.
What is your name?

529
00:43:44,965 --> 00:43:47,938
Sir, the list is correct. I
didn't ask you about the list.

530
00:43:48,035 --> 00:43:51,967
I asked you your name.
Klaus Tauber.

531
00:43:52,062 --> 00:43:54,172
Tauber.

532
00:43:54,268 --> 00:43:58,008
Hauptscharfuehrer, this gentleman
thinks a mistake's been made.

533
00:43:58,043 --> 00:44:00,406
My plant manager is
somewhere on this train.

534
00:44:00,502 --> 00:44:02,517
If it leaves with him on it,
it'll disrupt production...

535
00:44:02,612 --> 00:44:04,722
and the Armaments Board
will want to know why.

536
00:44:04,818 --> 00:44:06,988
Achtung, dieser Zug
faehrt jetzt ab.

537
00:44:07,023 --> 00:44:11,052
Is he on the list?
Yes, sir. Itzhak Stern.

538
00:44:11,148 --> 00:44:16,518
Well, the list is correct,
sir. There is nothing I can do.

539
00:44:16,614 --> 00:44:19,491
What is your name?
Close and secure all doors.

540
00:44:19,588 --> 00:44:22,944
My name? My name is Kunder.
This train is now leaving.

541
00:44:22,979 --> 00:44:25,119
Kunder.
Hauptscharfuehrer Kunder.

542
00:44:25,154 --> 00:44:27,262
K- U-N-D-E-R.
And what's yours?

543
00:44:27,297 --> 00:44:29,370
Schindler.
S- C-H-I-N-D-L-E-R.

544
00:44:29,466 --> 00:44:31,671
Gentlemen,
thank you very much.

545
00:44:31,768 --> 00:44:34,260
I think I can guarantee you
you'll both be in...

546
00:44:34,357 --> 00:44:37,905
Southern Russia before the
end of the month. Good day.

547
00:44:38,002 --> 00:44:40,878
Zamykac dokladnie drzwi.
Dokladnie zamykac drzwi.

548
00:44:40,913 --> 00:44:42,893
Stern!

549
00:44:42,988 --> 00:44:44,810
Stern!
Stern!

550
00:44:44,907 --> 00:44:46,729
Itzhak Stern!

551
00:44:52,867 --> 00:44:55,360
Stern!
Itzhak Stern!

552
00:44:55,457 --> 00:44:58,141
Stern.! Stern.!
Itzhak Stern.!

553
00:44:59,484 --> 00:45:00,635
Stern!

554
00:45:00,731 --> 00:45:02,553
Sir?

555
00:45:03,896 --> 00:45:06,774
Stern!
Herr Direktor.

556
00:45:06,869 --> 00:45:09,555
My apologies.

557
00:45:09,650 --> 00:45:12,431
Stop the train! He's here! I apologize.

558
00:45:12,528 --> 00:45:17,324
- Stop the train!
- Stop the train! Stop it!

559
00:45:29,312 --> 00:45:32,956
Sign here.
Initial there.

560
00:45:33,052 --> 00:45:36,265
Makes no difference to us, you
understand. This one, that one.

561
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:39,478
It's the inconvenience
to the list.

562
00:45:39,573 --> 00:45:43,218
It's the paperwork. I somehow
left my work card at home.

563
00:45:43,253 --> 00:45:46,862
I tried to explain them
it was a mistake, but-

564
00:45:46,958 --> 00:45:50,890
I'm sorry, it was stupid! What
if I got here five minutes later?

565
00:45:50,925 --> 00:45:53,576
Then where would I be?

566
00:47:30,057 --> 00:47:31,497
Shechel.

567
00:47:31,592 --> 00:47:34,373
Sacrean,
sacrean end tzukeer.

568
00:47:34,470 --> 00:47:36,867
Tzukeer end sacrean.

569
00:47:40,415 --> 00:47:42,909
I woke up from a dream
this morning.

570
00:47:43,006 --> 00:47:47,033
I was broke and sharing a room
with 12 people I didn't know,

571
00:47:47,130 --> 00:47:52,213
only to discover I was broke and sharing
a room with 12 people I didn't know.

572
00:47:53,171 --> 00:47:55,569
You laugh about it?
I have to laugh.

573
00:47:55,604 --> 00:47:58,411
You are living
behind walls.

574
00:47:58,446 --> 00:48:03,050
The walls I can deal with. It's the
restrictions to my life I'm tired of.

575
00:48:03,145 --> 00:48:06,118
Those walls keep them out.
That's all I care about.

576
00:48:06,214 --> 00:48:08,804
I like it here. There's
a kind of, I don't know,

577
00:48:08,900 --> 00:48:11,106
ancestral squalor
to it all.

578
00:48:11,201 --> 00:48:13,311
You are a slave to these
people. No one envies us anymore.

579
00:48:13,408 --> 00:48:15,387
I'm smart. Oh, yes, you're smart.

580
00:48:15,422 --> 00:48:17,627
You're a real genius.
You had your chance.

581
00:48:17,724 --> 00:48:22,231
Today, today I actually found
time to organize a thought.

582
00:48:22,327 --> 00:48:25,012
I can't remember
the last time I did that.

583
00:48:25,047 --> 00:48:26,896
When's the last time
we did this?

584
00:48:26,931 --> 00:48:29,233
When's the last time
we stood around and talked?

585
00:48:29,328 --> 00:48:32,493
No one ordered me
onto a truck today.

586
00:48:32,589 --> 00:48:34,795
No one took my business
away from me.

587
00:48:34,890 --> 00:48:36,808
You don't really have
a business to take.

588
00:48:36,905 --> 00:48:39,110
There's nowhere
down from here.

589
00:48:39,145 --> 00:48:41,316
This is it.
This is the bottom.

590
00:48:41,412 --> 00:48:44,961
The ghetto is... liberty.

591
00:48:50,907 --> 00:48:54,071
This street divides the
ghetto just about in half.

592
00:48:54,168 --> 00:48:59,311
civil employees,

593
00:48:59,346 --> 00:49:02,189
industrial workers
and so on.

594
00:49:02,224 --> 00:49:07,020
surplus labor,

595
00:49:07,115 --> 00:49:09,417
the elderly
and infirm mostly.

596
00:49:09,513 --> 00:49:12,390
Which is where you'll
want to start, huh?

597
00:49:12,485 --> 00:49:14,308
Do you have any
questions, sir?

598
00:49:14,404 --> 00:49:17,857
Ja, why is the top down?
I'm fucking freezing.

599
00:49:19,967 --> 00:49:22,521
We expect a labor force
of 25,000 to 30,000.

600
00:49:22,556 --> 00:49:25,529
Segregated, of course. The men
in the barracks near the quarry.

601
00:49:25,626 --> 00:49:27,496
The women on the other
side of the wire.

602
00:49:27,531 --> 00:49:29,366
My place is where?
There, sir.

603
00:49:29,461 --> 00:49:32,722
There? You call that a
villa? Yes, the villa.

604
00:49:32,818 --> 00:49:35,023
Their synagogue, can you
see it? That's not a villa.

605
00:49:35,120 --> 00:49:38,285
We're planning to turn it into
the camp stables. It's a house.

606
00:49:38,381 --> 00:49:42,025
What's that over there?

607
00:49:42,121 --> 00:49:44,772
Kindergarten.
Fifty-one.

608
00:49:44,807 --> 00:49:49,218
And we have a dentist,
shoemaker, practical physicians.

609
00:49:51,232 --> 00:49:54,493
There they are, sir.

610
00:49:54,528 --> 00:49:57,754
Hmm.

611
00:49:57,850 --> 00:50:02,070
One of you is, uh,
a very lucky girl.

612
00:50:02,165 --> 00:50:05,775
There is an opening
for a job,

613
00:50:05,810 --> 00:50:09,646
away from all this...
backbreaking work,

614
00:50:09,742 --> 00:50:13,099
at my new villa.

615
00:50:13,194 --> 00:50:17,606
Uh, which of you has...

616
00:50:17,703 --> 00:50:20,388
domestic experience?

617
00:50:23,169 --> 00:50:27,197
Ja, on second thought, I don't
really want someone else's maid.

618
00:50:27,294 --> 00:50:30,554
All those annoying habits
I have to undo.

619
00:50:35,253 --> 00:50:37,939
I don't want
to give you my cold.

620
00:50:38,034 --> 00:50:40,144
Uh, what's your name?

621
00:50:40,241 --> 00:50:42,446
Helen Hirsch.
What?

622
00:50:42,542 --> 00:50:44,365
Helen Hirsch.

623
00:50:44,460 --> 00:50:48,584
What? I can't hear. Helen Hirsch.

624
00:51:03,738 --> 00:51:06,231
Ja.
Take it all down.!

625
00:51:06,327 --> 00:51:08,629
To work.!

626
00:51:08,725 --> 00:51:12,945
Take it down.!
It is not safe.!

627
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:15,630
She says the foundation was poured
wrong. She's got to take it down.

628
00:51:15,726 --> 00:51:18,699
I told her it's the barracks,
not the fucking Hotel Europa.

629
00:51:18,794 --> 00:51:22,919
Fucking Jew bitch engineer.
You fucking bitch!

630
00:51:22,954 --> 00:51:27,043
Herr Kommandant.
The entire foundation...

631
00:51:27,139 --> 00:51:29,728
has to be torn down
and repoured.

632
00:51:29,824 --> 00:51:33,084
If not, there will be
at least a subsidence...

633
00:51:33,181 --> 00:51:35,675
at the southern end
of the barracks.

634
00:51:35,770 --> 00:51:38,360
Subsidence,
and then collapse.

635
00:51:38,395 --> 00:51:40,950
And you are an engineer? Yes.

636
00:51:41,045 --> 00:51:43,347
My name is Diana Reiter.
I'm a graduate...

637
00:51:43,442 --> 00:51:45,936
of Civil Engineering
from the University of Milan.

638
00:51:46,033 --> 00:51:49,677
Ah, an educated Jew,
like Karl Marx himself.

639
00:51:57,062 --> 00:52:00,226
Unterscharfuehrer.!
Jawohl?

640
00:52:00,323 --> 00:52:04,350
Shoot her.
What?

641
00:52:04,447 --> 00:52:08,858
Herr Kommandant,
I'm only trying to do my job.

642
00:52:08,954 --> 00:52:10,776
Ja, I'm doing mine.

643
00:52:10,873 --> 00:52:12,851
But, sir, she's foreman of construction.

644
00:52:12,886 --> 00:52:15,284
We are not going to have
arguments with these people.

645
00:52:15,319 --> 00:52:17,202
Okay.

646
00:52:18,737 --> 00:52:21,997
No. Shoot her here,
on my authority.

647
00:52:32,643 --> 00:52:34,752
It will take
more than that.

648
00:52:34,849 --> 00:52:38,014
I'm sure you're right.

649
00:52:43,769 --> 00:52:48,467
Take it down, repour it,
rebuild it. Like she said.

650
00:52:48,563 --> 00:52:52,016
We have more to see, but we
have only one more hour of light.

651
00:53:02,949 --> 00:53:06,881
Today is history.

652
00:53:06,977 --> 00:53:10,239
Today will be remembered.

653
00:53:10,334 --> 00:53:15,993
Years from now, the young
will ask with wonder...

654
00:53:16,028 --> 00:53:18,390
about this day.

655
00:53:18,486 --> 00:53:23,281
Today is history,
and you are part of it.

656
00:53:23,316 --> 00:53:26,254
Six hundred years ago...

657
00:53:28,748 --> 00:53:32,680
when elsewhere they were footing the blame for
the Black Death, Kazimierz the Great, so-called,

658
00:53:32,715 --> 00:53:35,845
##Ke laolam chasedo ## told
theJews they could come to Krakow.

659
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:38,914
Chaja, bread.
They came.

660
00:53:39,011 --> 00:53:42,079
Not that fat. No, less. They trundled
their belongings into the city.

661
00:53:42,175 --> 00:53:43,997
Yes, a bit less.
They settled.

662
00:53:44,094 --> 00:53:49,369
They took hold.
They prospered...

663
00:53:49,464 --> 00:53:54,355
in business, science,
education, the arts.

664
00:53:54,451 --> 00:53:57,041
They came here with nothing.

665
00:53:57,136 --> 00:53:59,342
Nothing.

666
00:54:00,493 --> 00:54:03,047
And they flourished.

667
00:54:03,082 --> 00:54:08,645
For six centuries
there has been a Jewish Krakow.

668
00:54:08,680 --> 00:54:11,810
Think about that.

669
00:54:11,907 --> 00:54:13,728
By this evening,

670
00:54:13,824 --> 00:54:17,756
those six centuries
are a rumor.

671
00:54:17,852 --> 00:54:21,544
They never happened.

672
00:54:21,579 --> 00:54:25,237

All right? Start from both sides?

678
00:55:08,779 --> 00:55:11,081
I would like you to start
there. The right side?

679
00:55:11,116 --> 00:55:13,383
The right side, yeah. And
then move around. Okay.

680
00:55:15,396 --> 00:55:19,616

Alles 'rueber

707
00:57:58,821 --> 00:58:01,027
We're getting out
through the sewers.

708
00:58:01,062 --> 00:58:03,233
I have to check
if they're clear.

709
00:58:03,328 --> 00:58:06,206
Mila, pack some things. Nothing bigger
than this. I can't go in the sewers.

710
00:58:06,302 --> 00:58:09,467
I told you I won't go
in the sewers.

711
00:58:12,343 --> 00:58:15,605
You can go.
Yes, you can.

712
00:58:17,715 --> 00:58:19,728
I won't go in the sewers.

Was soll denn die Scheisse?
Bist du denn verrueckt geworden?

722

Mit diesem Scheissgewehr haettest

Du hast so nah an mir

Chodzcie tu szybko.!

731
01:00:43,780 --> 01:00:46,178
She's good as dead.
Leave her.

732
01:00:46,274 --> 01:00:49,726
Give me a moment.
Just let me bring her inside.

733
01:00:55,001 --> 01:00:58,550
You can join her...
or join the line.

734
01:01:03,154 --> 01:01:05,421
Women to the left.! Wilhelm! Rose!

735
01:01:05,456 --> 01:01:08,237
Men to right.
Women to the left.

736
01:01:08,332 --> 01:01:10,921
Women to the left. Let me go!

737
01:01:15,525 --> 01:01:18,978
Women to the left, and men to
the right. Promise me, be safe.

738
01:01:20,800 --> 01:01:23,773
Your government
is in the wrong country.!

739
01:01:29,432 --> 01:01:31,637
Mama! Mama!

740
01:02:17,864 --> 01:02:19,687
Mila!

741
01:02:44,911 --> 01:02:48,363
Oh, God, Danka!

742
01:02:52,199 --> 01:02:54,849
You have a Blauschein.
Blauschein doesn't matter anymore.

743
01:02:54,884 --> 01:02:57,535
They are cleaning out the ghetto.
There's not enough room for you.

744
01:02:57,570 --> 01:03:01,118
What are you talking about? We tried it
before. There's more than enough room.

745
01:03:01,215 --> 01:03:04,091
- I changed my mind!
- Mama!

746
01:03:04,188 --> 01:03:08,408
Look at the space in there. Now
look at me. You are just scared.

747
01:03:08,503 --> 01:03:10,674
I can fit the girl,
but not you.

748
01:03:10,709 --> 01:03:13,106
- Mama, I'm coming out!
- Stay where you are.

749
01:03:13,203 --> 01:03:15,121
I'd rather you be here
than who knows where.

750
01:03:15,216 --> 01:03:17,039
Mama.!

751
01:03:36,987 --> 01:03:38,618
Herr Kommandant.!

752
01:03:38,714 --> 01:03:40,789
Very good saluting.

753
01:03:40,824 --> 01:03:44,469
I respectfully report I've been given
orders to clear the bundles from the road...

754
01:03:44,504 --> 01:03:47,502
so there will be no obstructions
to the thoroughfare.

755
01:03:47,537 --> 01:03:51,949
Finish and join the lines,
little Polish clicking soldier.

756
01:04:13,816 --> 01:04:15,638
Mrs. Dresner?

757
01:04:15,733 --> 01:04:17,556
Yes.

758
01:04:17,652 --> 01:04:19,954
Oh, you are a friend
of my son's.

759
01:04:20,049 --> 01:04:22,351
Don't worry, I'll go quietly.
I'll be no trouble.

760
01:04:22,448 --> 01:04:26,572
No, get under the stairs. They'll be
done searching soon. You'll be safe there.

761
01:04:26,667 --> 01:04:29,832
Please hide! Please!
... warmed by the sun.

762
01:04:29,928 --> 01:04:32,230
Hide under the stairs.

763
01:04:34,723 --> 01:04:37,504
I've searched the building.
There's no one here.

764
01:04:37,539 --> 01:04:40,286
Also, gehen wir zum naechsten
Block. Einverstanden.

765
01:04:47,383 --> 01:04:49,780
Danka.! Ah.!
Mama!

766
01:04:54,960 --> 01:04:57,069
Hello, Adam.

767
01:04:57,165 --> 01:04:59,179
H- Hello, Danka.

768
01:05:05,030 --> 01:05:08,770
Come with me. I will
put you in the good line.

769
01:05:10,496 --> 01:05:14,093
Do you know the saying, "An hour
of life is still life"?

770
01:05:14,128 --> 01:05:17,690
You are not a boy anymore.
I'm saying a blessing for you.

The SS will manage...

830
01:14:11,984 --> 01:14:14,958
certain industries itself
inside Plaszow-

831
01:14:14,993 --> 01:14:17,608
a metalworks,
brush factory,

832
01:14:17,643 --> 01:14:19,815
another for reprocessing
Jewish clothing...

833
01:14:19,850 --> 01:14:23,650
from the ghettos for use by
bombed-out families back home.

834
01:14:23,685 --> 01:14:26,755
But it's private industry like
yours that stands to benefit most...

835
01:14:26,790 --> 01:14:29,057
by moving inside the wire of
Commandant Amon Goeth's camp-

836
01:14:29,092 --> 01:14:31,838
No, no, no. Sit, sit.

01:14:49,676 --> 01:14:52,265
How are you doing?
Oskar Schindler.

843
01:14:53,895 --> 01:14:57,157
We started without you.
Fine. I miss anything good?

844
01:14:57,253 --> 01:15:00,321
I was explaining to Herr
Bosch and Herr Madritsch...

845
01:15:00,418 --> 01:15:03,199
some of the benefits of moving
their factories into Plaszow.

846
01:15:03,234 --> 01:15:06,076
I meant the food.

847
01:15:08,090 --> 01:15:12,022
Since your labor is housed on-site,
it's available to you at all times.

848
01:15:12,119 --> 01:15:14,228
You can work them
all night if you want.

849
01:15:14,324 --> 01:15:18,640
Your factory policies, whatever they've
been in the past, they'll continue to be.

850
01:15:18,675 --> 01:15:20,750
They'll be respected.

851
01:15:20,846 --> 01:15:24,970
I have to know, where do you get a suit
like that? What is that? Is that silk?

852
01:15:25,005 --> 01:15:26,853
Of course.

853
01:15:26,888 --> 01:15:31,012
Ja. It's- It has
a nice sheen about it.

854
01:15:31,107 --> 01:15:32,930
Thank you.
Very nice.

855
01:15:33,026 --> 01:15:36,670
I'd say I'd get you one, but the
man who made it is probably dead.

856
01:15:36,766 --> 01:15:39,164
I don't know.

857
01:15:39,260 --> 01:15:42,904
I go to work the other day.

858
01:15:42,939 --> 01:15:45,110
Nobody's there.

859
01:15:45,205 --> 01:15:48,467
Nobody tells me about this. I
have to fid out. I have to go in.

860
01:15:48,563 --> 01:15:51,920
Everybody's gone.

861
01:15:52,015 --> 01:15:56,906
No.

862
01:15:59,496 --> 01:16:01,989
They're not gone.
They're here.

863
01:16:02,086 --> 01:16:06,846
They're mine! Every day that
goes by, I'm losing money.

864
01:16:06,881 --> 01:16:10,909
Every worker that is shot costs me
money. I have to find somebody else.

865
01:16:11,005 --> 01:16:13,498
We are going to be making so much money
that none of this is going to matter.

866
01:16:13,594 --> 01:16:15,033
It's bad business.

867
01:16:27,500 --> 01:16:29,384
Thank you.

868
01:16:29,419 --> 01:16:31,912
Leave the bottle.

869
01:16:33,063 --> 01:16:35,174
Take that.

870
01:16:35,269 --> 01:16:38,722
Lena... thank you.

871
01:16:47,641 --> 01:16:50,615
Scherner told me
something else about you.

872
01:16:52,820 --> 01:16:55,086
Yeah?
What's that?

873
01:16:55,121 --> 01:16:59,630
That you know the meaning
of the word "gratitude. "

874
01:16:59,725 --> 01:17:03,082
That it's not
some vague thing with you...

875
01:17:03,178 --> 01:17:06,212
like it is with others.

876
01:17:06,247 --> 01:17:09,603
You want to stay
where you are.

877
01:17:09,700 --> 01:17:12,673
You've got things
going on the side.

878
01:17:12,769 --> 01:17:14,783
Things are good.

879
01:17:14,878 --> 01:17:19,194
You don't want anybody
telling you what to do.

880
01:17:19,290 --> 01:17:23,606
I can understand all that,
you know. I- I know you.

881
01:17:25,620 --> 01:17:30,607
What you want...
is your own sub-camp.

882
01:17:35,786 --> 01:17:39,143
Do you have any idea what is
involved? The paperwork alone?

883
01:17:39,239 --> 01:17:43,219
You've got to build the thing. Getting those
fucking permits is enough to drive you crazy.

884
01:17:43,254 --> 01:17:47,165
Then the engineers show up, they stand
around, they argue about drainage, foundations,

885
01:17:47,200 --> 01:17:52,282
codes, exact specifications, fences four
kilometers long, 1,200 kilograms of barbed wire,

886
01:17:52,378 --> 01:17:55,543
6,000 kilograms of electrified
fences, ceramic insulators,

887
01:17:55,578 --> 01:17:57,234
three cubic meters
of air space per prisoner.

888
01:17:57,269 --> 01:18:01,201
I'm telling you, you want to shoot
somebody. I've been through it. I know.

889
01:18:01,236 --> 01:18:04,846
Well, you know.
You've been through it.

890
01:18:06,668 --> 01:18:09,641
You could make things
easier for me.

891
01:18:12,519 --> 01:18:14,532
I'd be grateful.

892
01:18:17,985 --> 01:18:20,286
Aus dem Weg da.!

893
01:18:29,973 --> 01:18:33,714
Weitergehen.!
Weitergehen.!

894
01:18:34,960 --> 01:18:38,221
Wlewo zwrot.!
Trzymac szereg.!

895
01:18:38,318 --> 01:18:41,099
Weitergehen.
Nach links.

896
01:18:48,387 --> 01:18:50,306
Where's Stern?

897
01:18:53,854 --> 01:18:57,786
Goldberg and Chilowicz...
make sure I see my cut...

898
01:18:57,882 --> 01:19:01,239
from the, uh,
factory owners in this camp,

899
01:19:01,335 --> 01:19:04,596
leaving you to take care
of my main account-

900
01:19:04,691 --> 01:19:07,856
the Schindler account.

901
01:19:07,952 --> 01:19:11,788
He wants his independence.
I gave it to him.

902
01:19:11,885 --> 01:19:14,666
But independence
costs money.

903
01:19:14,762 --> 01:19:17,063
This you
understand?

904
01:19:21,762 --> 01:19:23,585
Look at me.

905
01:19:33,847 --> 01:19:37,779
Don't forget who
you are working for now.

906
01:19:46,986 --> 01:19:50,055
Jawohl.!
Make sure he kisses

907
01:19:50,151 --> 01:19:53,412
Ja. Now, girls,
everyone.

908
01:19:56,193 --> 01:19:58,687
We need more wine.
More wine!

909
01:19:58,782 --> 01:20:02,427
Stand in my place.
Don't let him leave.

910
01:20:17,772 --> 01:20:21,033
## Was passiert denn in
einem Leben ## Prost.! Prost.!

911
01:20:22,951 --> 01:20:25,541
Thank you,
Herr Direktor.

912
01:20:25,637 --> 01:20:27,938
Prost,
Herr Direktor!

913
01:20:31,870 --> 01:20:35,228
What are you doing? What?

914
01:20:35,323 --> 01:20:39,543
Makes them think we have lice.
Helps them keep their distance.

915
01:20:39,639 --> 01:20:42,036
Do you have lice?
Do you have your notebook?

916
01:20:42,133 --> 01:20:45,586
The calendar on my desk has the birthdays
of our SS friends' wives and children.

917
01:20:45,681 --> 01:20:48,140
Don't forget
to send something.

918
01:20:48,175 --> 01:20:51,532
Record payoffs to the Main Administration
and Economics Office, the Arm-

919
01:20:51,627 --> 01:20:55,367
Slower, Stern, slower. The Armaments
Board, Governor General's Division...

920
01:20:55,464 --> 01:20:58,245
of the Interior
and Chief of Police as "fees,"

921
01:20:58,341 --> 01:21:00,258
and make them
on the first of each month,

922
01:21:00,355 --> 01:21:02,560
as opposed to individual payoffs
to our SS contacts.

923
01:21:02,657 --> 01:21:07,835
The list is in the lower drawer of
my desk, which you- "First of month-"

924
01:21:07,932 --> 01:21:10,713
list, lower drawer of my
desk, which you handle...

925
01:21:10,808 --> 01:21:14,837
as cash contributions to legitimate
charities sent to each official's office.

926
01:21:14,932 --> 01:21:18,193
Dealings with our black market
contacts, listed as suppliers...

927
01:21:18,228 --> 01:21:21,455
in the legitimate ledger, are
more complicated. Forget it.

928
01:21:21,550 --> 01:21:25,290
What do you mean, forget it? You can't
forget it! It gives me a headache!

929
01:21:31,813 --> 01:21:35,038
I couldn't get you out of
here. I'll be all right.

930
01:21:35,073 --> 01:21:39,101
Anyway, I'm here almost every
week. Wednesdays, usually.

931
01:21:39,136 --> 01:21:42,458
I'll look in on you,
see how you're doing.

932
01:21:44,472 --> 01:21:48,020
Here, put these
in your pocket.

933
01:21:48,055 --> 01:21:50,035
Come on.

934
01:21:52,719 --> 01:21:55,981
Herr Direktor,
don't let things fall apart.

935
01:21:56,076 --> 01:21:58,186
I've worked too hard.

936
01:22:06,147 --> 01:22:10,558
Thanks for-
Good luck.

937
01:22:31,466 --> 01:22:33,768
Achtung, Muetzen ab.!

938
01:22:43,262 --> 01:22:45,660
- Work!
- An die Arbeit.!

939
01:22:58,800 --> 01:23:00,238
What are you making?

940
01:23:00,526 --> 01:23:02,923
Hinges, sir.

941
01:23:05,705 --> 01:23:09,158
Ja, I've got some workers coming in
tomorrow. Where are they from again?

942
01:23:09,253 --> 01:23:11,555
Yugoslavia,
Herr Kommandant.

943
01:23:11,590 --> 01:23:13,761
I've got to make room.

944
01:23:16,063 --> 01:23:19,227
Make me a hinge.
Yes, sir.

945
01:23:49,342 --> 01:23:52,412
Keep going,
you're doing well.

946
01:23:52,507 --> 01:23:54,521
Says he's
doing well.

947
01:24:00,947 --> 01:24:03,501
Oh, that's very good.

948
01:24:03,536 --> 01:24:07,373
But I'm a bit confused,
and perhaps you can help me.

949
01:24:07,469 --> 01:24:10,729
What I don't understand
is that you've been working...

950
01:24:10,826 --> 01:24:14,374
since I think, what,
about six this morning?

951
01:24:15,909 --> 01:24:20,128
Yet such a small pile
of hinges.

952
01:24:48,037 --> 01:24:50,783
Oh, Christ.
May I try that, sir?

953
01:24:50,818 --> 01:24:52,989
Check the angle-lever.
Maybe it's bent.

954
01:24:53,024 --> 01:24:56,381
No, no. You wouldn't hear a
click if it was the angle-lever.

955
01:24:56,477 --> 01:24:58,779
Maybe it's the pin. Maybe the
pin shaft is greasy. Ja, come on.

956
01:24:58,814 --> 01:25:01,752
What did I just say?
Here.

957
01:25:03,095 --> 01:25:06,547
Herr Kommandant,

958
01:25:06,643 --> 01:25:10,959
I beg to report that my heap
ofhinges was so unsatisfactory...

959
01:25:11,054 --> 01:25:15,178
because the machines were
being recalibrated this morning.

960
01:25:15,275 --> 01:25:19,974
I w-was put on
to shoveling coal.

961
01:25:42,799 --> 01:25:44,814
Strange, huh?

962
01:25:44,909 --> 01:25:46,731
Yeah.

963
01:25:51,335 --> 01:25:54,405
Thank you, Muek.

964
01:25:54,500 --> 01:25:58,240
Ah, Lisiek. Don't touch the
leather, it's just been oiled.

965
01:25:58,337 --> 01:25:59,932
Rottenfuehrer.
Oh, for me?

966
01:25:59,967 --> 01:26:03,515
Oh, thank you very much, Herr
Direktor. Thank you. Herr Direktor!

967
01:26:03,612 --> 01:26:06,009
Herr Direktor.!

968
01:26:08,503 --> 01:26:10,996
Herr Direktor.!

969
01:26:12,147 --> 01:26:14,065
He was making
hinges slowly.

970
01:26:14,160 --> 01:26:18,861
So the man can turn out a hinge in less
than a minute. Why the long story? Hmm?

971
01:26:46,769 --> 01:26:49,455
Thank you, sir.
You're welcome.

972
01:26:52,523 --> 01:26:56,360
Nobody knows who stole the chicken,
hmm? Tell him about the chicken.

973
01:26:56,395 --> 01:27:00,964
A man walks around with a
chicken and nobody notices this.

974
01:27:01,059 --> 01:27:03,457
Save yourselves.

975
01:27:03,553 --> 01:27:05,854
Tell him
about the chicken.

976
01:27:20,912 --> 01:27:22,926
Still nobody knows.

977
01:27:34,147 --> 01:27:37,120
It was you.
You committed this crime.

978
01:27:37,155 --> 01:27:40,093
No, sir.
But you know who, though.

979
01:27:40,189 --> 01:27:42,395
Yes.
Who?

980
01:27:42,491 --> 01:27:45,368
Him!

981
01:27:48,724 --> 01:27:52,466
He's very gifted. Yeah,
sure. Bring him over.

982
01:27:55,150 --> 01:27:58,891
Yes, sir.
Thank you.

983
01:28:04,741 --> 01:28:07,487
Thank you again, Herr
Direktor. You're welcome again.

984
01:28:07,522 --> 01:28:11,167
It's an honor to work for such a
great company. It's great to have you.

985
01:28:11,263 --> 01:28:15,291
I promise to learn everything about
enamelware production. That's great.

986
01:28:27,279 --> 01:28:31,307
Hello? Miss Elsa Krause is
here. I only need five minutes.

987
01:28:31,342 --> 01:28:33,993
She wants to speak
to the Herr Direktor.

988
01:28:52,694 --> 01:28:54,805
Yes.

989
01:28:58,832 --> 01:29:01,039
He won't see you.

990
01:29:30,386 --> 01:29:32,400
Please, sit down.

991
01:29:35,469 --> 01:29:38,250
Pernod? Cognac? Uh, no.

992
01:29:39,401 --> 01:29:42,182
So, what
can I do for you?

993
01:29:46,018 --> 01:29:48,799
They say that no one
dies here.

994
01:29:48,834 --> 01:29:51,581
They say your factory
is a haven.

995
01:29:54,267 --> 01:29:56,473
They say you are good.

996
01:29:59,350 --> 01:30:01,459
Who says that?

997
01:30:01,556 --> 01:30:03,569
Everyone.

998
01:30:09,707 --> 01:30:12,489
My name is Regina Perlman,
not Elsa Krause.

999
01:30:12,585 --> 01:30:15,654
I've been living in Krakow on false
papers since the ghetto massacre.

1000
01:30:15,749 --> 01:30:17,189
My parents are in Plaszow.

1001
01:30:17,284 --> 01:30:21,600
Their names are
Chana and Jakob Perlman.

1002
01:30:21,696 --> 01:30:25,340
They are older people. They are
killing older people now in Plaszow.

1003
01:30:25,375 --> 01:30:29,177
They bury them
up in the forest. Look...

1004
01:30:29,272 --> 01:30:32,054
I don't have any money.

1005
01:30:32,150 --> 01:30:34,931
I, I borrowed
these clothes.

1006
01:30:37,521 --> 01:30:39,535
I'm begging you.

1007
01:30:39,630 --> 01:30:43,370
Please, please
bring them here.

1008
01:30:43,467 --> 01:30:45,829
I don't do that.

1009
01:30:45,864 --> 01:30:49,666
You've been misled.
I ask one thing:

1010
01:30:49,701 --> 01:30:52,674
whether or not a worker
has certain skills.

1011
01:30:52,709 --> 01:30:55,647
My father is an importer,
not a metalworker.

1012
01:30:55,743 --> 01:30:59,483
Such activities are illegal.
You will not entrap me!

1013
01:30:59,579 --> 01:31:03,703
Cry, and I will have you
arrested. I swear to God!

1014
01:31:13,006 --> 01:31:15,595
People die.
It's a fact of life.

1015
01:31:15,691 --> 01:31:19,336
He wants to kill everybody? Great!
What am I supposed to do about it?

1016
01:31:19,432 --> 01:31:22,021
Bring everybody over?
Is that what you think?

1017
01:31:22,117 --> 01:31:24,863
Send them over to Schindler.
Send them all!

1018
01:31:24,898 --> 01:31:28,447
His place is a haven, didn't
you know? It's not a factory.

1019
01:31:28,543 --> 01:31:31,036
It's not an enterprise
of any kind.

1020
01:31:31,071 --> 01:31:33,529
It's a haven for rabbis
and orphans...

1021
01:31:33,626 --> 01:31:36,790
and people with
no skills whatsoever!

1022
01:31:38,038 --> 01:31:42,127
You think I don't know
what you're doing?

1023
01:31:42,162 --> 01:31:45,614
You're so quiet all the
time. I know, I know!

1024
01:31:45,710 --> 01:31:48,491
Are you losing money?
That's not the point!

1025
01:31:48,587 --> 01:31:52,328
What other point is
- It's dangerous! It's dangerous to me!

1026
01:31:54,659 --> 01:31:58,111
You have to understand. Goeth
is under enormous pressure.

1027
01:31:58,207 --> 01:32:01,276
You have to think of it
in his situation.

1028
01:32:01,372 --> 01:32:04,153
He's got this
whole place to run.

1029
01:32:04,250 --> 01:32:07,031
He's responsible for everything
here, all these people.

1030
01:32:07,126 --> 01:32:09,969
He's got a lot of things
to worry about.

1031
01:32:10,004 --> 01:32:14,032
And he's got the war which
brings out the worst in people.

1032
01:32:14,128 --> 01:32:17,389
Never the good, always
the bad. Always the bad.

1033
01:32:19,594 --> 01:32:24,007
But in normal circumstances he wouldn't
be like this. He'd be all right.

1034
01:32:24,102 --> 01:32:27,459
There'd just be the good
aspects of him which-

1035
01:32:27,494 --> 01:32:31,007
He's a wonderful crook.

1036
01:32:31,103 --> 01:32:35,323
A man who loves good food, good
wine, the ladies, making money-

1037
01:32:35,419 --> 01:32:37,590
Killing.

1038
01:32:37,625 --> 01:32:40,310
He can't enjoy it.

1039
01:32:40,406 --> 01:32:43,379
Bejski told me the other day,
somebody escaped...

1040
01:32:43,475 --> 01:32:46,126
from a work detail
outside the wire.

1041
01:32:46,161 --> 01:32:49,997
Goeth lined up everybody
from the missing man's barracks.

1042
01:32:50,093 --> 01:32:53,881
He shot the man to the left of
Bejski, the man to the right ofhim.

1043
01:32:53,916 --> 01:32:57,669
He walked down the line shooting
every other man with the pistol.

1044
01:33:02,560 --> 01:33:04,959
Twenty-five.

1045
01:33:08,699 --> 01:33:12,247
What do you want me to do
about it? Nothing, nothing.

1046
01:33:12,343 --> 01:33:14,549
We're just talking.

1047
01:33:25,770 --> 01:33:27,592
"Perlman. "

1048
01:33:29,223 --> 01:33:31,202
Perlman!

1049
01:33:31,237 --> 01:33:33,921
Husband and wife.

1050
01:33:34,018 --> 01:33:37,663
Jakob and Chana Perlman!

1051
01:33:50,322 --> 01:33:53,486
Have Goldberg
bring them over.

1052
01:33:55,309 --> 01:33:58,569
Muetzen ab!

1053
01:33:58,666 --> 01:34:00,680
Appell abtreten!

1054
01:34:46,523 --> 01:34:50,455
I'm sure this will be better
than those rags, Lisiek.

1055
01:34:50,551 --> 01:34:54,292
Herr Direktor, I was just helping
Lisiek to find something...

1056
01:34:54,387 --> 01:34:57,169
to clean the stains from the
Herr Kommandant's bathtub.

1057
01:34:57,265 --> 01:35:00,046
Go, please. Pardon me, Herr Direktor.

1058
01:35:01,869 --> 01:35:06,376
You don't have to report
to me, Helen.

1059
01:35:06,411 --> 01:35:09,541
You know who I am?
Hmm?

1060
01:35:17,213 --> 01:35:20,474
I'm Schindler.

1061
01:35:20,570 --> 01:35:23,543
Of course.
I- I have heard and...

1062
01:35:23,639 --> 01:35:26,517
you have
been here before.

1063
01:35:28,626 --> 01:35:31,503
Here, why don't you
keep this someplace?

1064
01:35:31,600 --> 01:35:34,956
Go on, take it.
I get extra food here.

1065
01:35:35,052 --> 01:35:39,559
Well, if you don't want to eat
it, trade it. Or give it to Lisiek.

1066
01:35:42,245 --> 01:35:44,451
Why not
build yourself up?

1067
01:35:48,863 --> 01:35:52,698
My first day here,
he beat me...

1068
01:35:52,795 --> 01:35:56,535
because I threw out
the bones from dinner.

1069
01:35:59,603 --> 01:36:03,920
He came down to the basement
at midnight, and he-

1070
01:36:04,016 --> 01:36:06,605
he asked me
where they were.

1071
01:36:09,003 --> 01:36:13,414
For his dogs,
you understand.

1072
01:36:15,525 --> 01:36:19,457
I said to him, I-
I don't know how I say this.

1073
01:36:19,552 --> 01:36:22,910
I never could say it now-
I said to him,

1074
01:36:23,005 --> 01:36:25,307
"Why are you beating me?"

1075
01:36:28,375 --> 01:36:31,925
He said, "The reason
I beat you now...

1076
01:36:32,020 --> 01:36:35,761
is because you ask
why I beat you. "

1077
01:36:37,582 --> 01:36:40,365
I know your
sufferings, Helen.

1078
01:36:42,762 --> 01:36:45,064
It doesn't matter.

1079
01:36:46,694 --> 01:36:49,572
I have accepted them.

1080
01:36:49,607 --> 01:36:51,777
Accepted them?

1081
01:36:53,504 --> 01:36:55,614
One day
he will shoot me.

1082
01:36:55,709 --> 01:36:58,011
No, no, no, no,
he won't shoot you.

1083
01:36:58,107 --> 01:37:01,655
I know.
I see things.

1084
01:37:01,751 --> 01:37:05,013
We were on the roof on Monday,
young Lisiek and I,

1085
01:37:05,108 --> 01:37:09,376
and we saw the Herr Kommandant
come out of the front door...

1086
01:37:09,411 --> 01:37:13,644
and down the steps by the patio
right there below us and-

1087
01:37:13,740 --> 01:37:18,439
and there on the steps
he drew his gun and he...

1088
01:37:18,535 --> 01:37:21,316
shot a woman
who was passing by.

1089
01:37:22,755 --> 01:37:25,920
A woman carrying a bundle.
Through the throat.

1090
01:37:26,016 --> 01:37:29,468
Just
- Just a woman on her way somewhere, you know.

1091
01:37:29,564 --> 01:37:33,305
She was no fatter
or thinner...

1092
01:37:33,401 --> 01:37:35,702
or slower or faster
than anyone else,

1093
01:37:35,798 --> 01:37:39,347
and I couldn't guess
what had she done.

1094
01:37:43,950 --> 01:37:47,464
The more you see
of the Herr Kommandant,

1095
01:37:47,499 --> 01:37:52,259
the more you see there is no
set rules that you can live by.

1096
01:37:52,294 --> 01:37:56,994
You can't say to yourself, "If I
follow these rules, I will be safe. "

1097
01:38:00,447 --> 01:38:04,535
He won't shoot you because
he enjoys you too much.

1098
01:38:04,570 --> 01:38:08,503
He enjoys you so much he won't
even let you wear the star.

1099
01:38:08,598 --> 01:38:10,900
He doesn't want
anyone else to know...

1100
01:38:10,996 --> 01:38:13,297
it's a Jew
he's enjoying.

1101
01:38:16,559 --> 01:38:19,819
He shot the woman
from the steps...

1102
01:38:19,854 --> 01:38:23,080
because she meant
nothing to him.

1103
01:38:23,176 --> 01:38:25,477
She was
one of a series,

1104
01:38:25,574 --> 01:38:28,163
neither offending
or pleasing him.

1105
01:38:31,903 --> 01:38:34,205
But you, Helen.

1106
01:38:38,521 --> 01:38:42,837
It's all right. It's
not that kind of a kiss.

1107
01:38:46,961 --> 01:38:49,358
Thank you.

1108
01:38:49,393 --> 01:38:51,373
Shh.

1109
01:38:54,441 --> 01:38:56,264
Here.

1110
01:39:02,210 --> 01:39:04,512
Right. The wine.

1111
01:39:11,322 --> 01:39:14,198
Wonderful party, Amon.
Thank you.

1112
01:39:22,350 --> 01:39:25,132
Why do you drink
that motor oil?

1113
01:39:25,228 --> 01:39:28,166
Hmm? I send you
good stuff all the time.

1114
01:39:28,201 --> 01:39:32,038
Your liver's going to
explode like a hand grenade.

1115
01:39:32,133 --> 01:39:34,914
The more I look at you-

1116
01:39:35,010 --> 01:39:37,216
I watch you.

1117
01:39:38,751 --> 01:39:40,764
You're never drunk.

1118
01:39:40,861 --> 01:39:44,697
Oh, that's-

1119
01:39:44,793 --> 01:39:47,334
that's real control.

1120
01:39:47,369 --> 01:39:49,876
Control is power.

1121
01:39:50,834 --> 01:39:53,041
That's power.

1122
01:39:56,685 --> 01:40:00,486
Is that why they fear us?

1123
01:40:00,521 --> 01:40:05,029
We have the fucking power to
kill, that's why they fear us.

1124
01:40:05,124 --> 01:40:08,866
They fear us because we have
the power to kill arbitrarily.

1125
01:40:08,961 --> 01:40:11,071
A man commits a crime,
he should know better.

1126
01:40:11,167 --> 01:40:13,660
We have him killed,
and feel good about it.

1127
01:40:13,757 --> 01:40:16,633
Or we kill him ourselves
and we feel even better.

1128
01:40:18,839 --> 01:40:21,813
That's not power,
though.

1129
01:40:21,908 --> 01:40:25,937
That's justice.
It's different than power.

1130
01:40:28,526 --> 01:40:33,417
Power is when we have every
justification to kill...

1131
01:40:33,513 --> 01:40:36,007
and we don't.

1132
01:40:36,103 --> 01:40:38,212
You think that's power?

1133
01:40:40,802 --> 01:40:43,871
That's what the emperors had.
A man stole something,

1134
01:40:43,967 --> 01:40:45,502
he's brought in
before the emperor,

1135
01:40:45,597 --> 01:40:49,529
he throws himself down on
the ground, he begs for mercy.

1136
01:40:49,626 --> 01:40:52,982
He knows
he's going to die.

1137
01:40:54,804 --> 01:40:58,161
And the emperor...
pardons him.

1138
01:40:59,408 --> 01:41:02,573
This worthless man.
He lets him go.

1139
01:41:05,546 --> 01:41:07,943
I think you are drunk.

1140
01:41:09,574 --> 01:41:12,451
That's power, Amon.

1141
01:41:12,547 --> 01:41:15,807
That... is power.

1142
01:41:23,193 --> 01:41:25,878
Amon the Good.

1143
01:41:28,756 --> 01:41:31,824
I pardon you.

1144
01:41:37,195 --> 01:41:39,593
What do they want?

1145
01:41:39,688 --> 01:41:42,949
I don't know, but they're in my
office now reviewing our books.

1146
01:41:43,046 --> 01:41:46,114
As my accountant, tell me,
should I be alarmed...

1147
01:41:46,211 --> 01:41:48,992
that the auditors are
reviewing my books? Well-

1148
01:41:49,087 --> 01:41:51,773
Or have you done your job
properly? You needn't be alarmed.

1149
01:41:51,869 --> 01:41:53,786
I needn't
be alarmed.

1150
01:41:56,280 --> 01:41:58,774
I'm sorry, sir.

1151
01:41:58,870 --> 01:42:00,884
Do you know how much
this saddle is worth?

1152
01:42:00,919 --> 01:42:03,474
Do you know how much
it costs?

1153
01:42:07,981 --> 01:42:13,543
All right.

1154
01:42:16,805 --> 01:42:19,777
Stern, what the hell are you
doing following me around?

1155
01:42:28,601 --> 01:42:31,862
Barracken eins, elf,

1156
01:42:31,957 --> 01:42:34,451

1157

am Appellplatz melden.

1158
01:43:03,702 --> 01:43:06,484
She was smoking
on the job.

1159
01:43:10,033 --> 01:43:13,006
Tell her
not to do it again.

1160
01:43:27,967 --> 01:43:30,749
I have to report, sir,

1161
01:43:30,844 --> 01:43:34,584
I've been unable to remove
the stains from your bathtub.

1162
01:43:38,613 --> 01:43:42,257
What are you using,
Lisiek? Soap, Commandant.

1163
01:43:44,559 --> 01:43:46,861
Soap? Not lye?

1164
01:43:55,684 --> 01:43:59,520
Go ahead, go on, leave.
Leave, I pardon you.

1165
01:44:20,716 --> 01:44:22,825
I pardon you.

1166
01:46:10,049 --> 01:46:13,502
Although I am not a rabbi,
in these circumstances...

1167
01:46:13,597 --> 01:46:16,187
I pray to the Almighty
that you will forgive me...

1168
01:46:16,283 --> 01:46:19,256
if I intone the blessings.

1169
01:46:19,352 --> 01:46:22,037

01:46:51,132 --> 01:46:57,043
##Zejest okrutna i zla ##

1177
01:46:57,140 --> 01:47:04,524
##Milosc ci wszystko wybaczy ##

1178
01:47:04,620 --> 01:47:07,880
# Bo milosc moj mily to ja #

1179
01:47:09,703 --> 01:47:11,969
So...

1180
01:47:12,004 --> 01:47:15,937
this is where you come
to hide from me.

1181
01:47:16,033 --> 01:47:19,198
I came to tell you...

1182
01:47:19,294 --> 01:47:23,130
that you, um, you really are
a wonderful cook...

1183
01:47:23,165 --> 01:47:26,104
and a well-trained servant.

1184
01:47:26,199 --> 01:47:30,418
I mean it. If you need a
reference after the war,

1185
01:47:30,515 --> 01:47:35,119
I'd be- I'd be happy
to give you one.

1186
01:47:35,214 --> 01:47:37,516
It must get lonely
down here...

1187
01:47:37,612 --> 01:47:41,832
when you're listening to everyone
upstairs having such a good time.

1188
01:47:48,737 --> 01:47:50,942
Does it?

1189
01:47:52,574 --> 01:47:54,491
You can answer.

1190
01:47:56,793 --> 01:48:01,013
But what's the right answer?
That's what you're thinking.

1191
01:48:01,109 --> 01:48:03,986
What does he want to hear?

1192
01:48:08,877 --> 01:48:12,906
The truth, Helen,
is always the right answer.

1193
01:48:15,495 --> 01:48:17,953
Y- Yes, you're right.

1194
01:48:17,988 --> 01:48:21,346
Sometimes
we're both lonely.

1195
01:48:21,441 --> 01:48:24,283
Yes. I-

1196
01:48:24,318 --> 01:48:27,770
I mean-

1197
01:48:34,388 --> 01:48:37,649
I would like so much to...

1198
01:48:37,745 --> 01:48:41,485
reach out and touch you
in your loneliness.

1199
01:48:41,582 --> 01:48:44,843
Wh-What would that be like,
I wonder? I mean...

1200
01:48:44,938 --> 01:48:48,487
what would be wrong with that?

1201
01:48:48,583 --> 01:48:52,707
I realize that you're not
a- a person in the-

1202
01:48:52,802 --> 01:48:55,548
the strictest sense
of the word, but-

1203
01:48:55,583 --> 01:48:58,941
No, maybe you're right
about that too, you know.

1204
01:48:58,976 --> 01:49:03,736
Maybe what's-
what's wrong isn't-

1205
01:49:03,771 --> 01:49:06,230
It's not us.

1206
01:49:06,325 --> 01:49:08,627
It's no-
It's this.

1207
01:49:11,024 --> 01:49:15,113
I mean, when they
compare you to-

1208
01:49:15,148 --> 01:49:18,314
to, uh, vermin
and to rodents and to lice...

1209
01:49:20,328 --> 01:49:23,204
I just, uh-

1210
01:49:26,562 --> 01:49:29,343
N- No, you-you make
a good point.

1211
01:49:29,438 --> 01:49:31,740
You make
a very good point.

1212
01:49:39,796 --> 01:49:42,098
Is this the face
of a rat?

1213
01:49:45,168 --> 01:49:47,277
Are these the eyes
of a rat?

1214
01:49:47,373 --> 01:49:50,154
# Milosc... #

1215
01:49:50,251 --> 01:49:54,326
Hath not a Jew eyes?

1216
01:49:54,361 --> 01:49:59,643
# Ci wszystko wybaczy #

1217
01:49:59,678 --> 01:50:04,925
# Bo milosc moj mily #

1218
01:50:07,993 --> 01:50:11,541
I feel for you, Helen.

1219
01:50:14,227 --> 01:50:18,927
## Toja ####

1220
01:50:27,654 --> 01:50:30,339
No, I don't think so.

1221
01:50:32,257 --> 01:50:35,039
You're a Jewish bitch.

1222
01:50:36,573 --> 01:50:40,505
You nearly talked me into it,
Helen, didn't you?

1223
01:50:45,588 --> 01:50:48,082
Bravo.

1224
01:51:03,043 --> 01:51:06,496
Hoch.! Hoch.! Hoch.!

1225
01:51:09,085 --> 01:51:12,730
- Jawohl.!
- Hoch.! Hoch.!

1226
01:51:12,826 --> 01:51:15,895
Hoch!

1227
01:51:20,978 --> 01:51:23,472
On behalf of the-
of the workers, sir,

1228
01:51:23,567 --> 01:51:26,637
I, I wish for you
a happy birthday.

1229
01:51:26,732 --> 01:51:28,650
Happy birthday.

1230
01:51:28,747 --> 01:51:30,952
Well, thank
the staff, please.

1231
01:51:31,048 --> 01:51:33,734
Thank you very much
for the lovely cake.

1232
01:51:50,805 --> 01:51:55,409
Thank you very much.
Tell them thank you from me.

1233
01:52:02,986 --> 01:52:06,630
## To ostatnia niedziela ##

1234
01:52:06,726 --> 01:52:09,986
##Dzisiaj sie rozstaniemy ##

1235
01:52:10,083 --> 01:52:14,782
The trains arrived and the
people were driven out with clubs.

1236
01:52:14,817 --> 01:52:19,098
They were lined up in front
of two big warehouses.

1237
01:52:19,193 --> 01:52:23,125
One was marked "Cloak Room,"
and the other "Valuables. "

1238
01:52:23,222 --> 01:52:25,524
And there they
were made to undress.

1239
01:52:25,619 --> 01:52:29,935
AJewish boy handed them pieces of
string to tie their shoes together.

1240
01:52:30,031 --> 01:52:32,620
They shaved their hair.

1241
01:52:32,716 --> 01:52:37,415
They told them it was needed to make
something special for U-boat crews.

1242
01:52:37,512 --> 01:52:41,539
And then they were herded
down a big corridor...

1243
01:52:41,636 --> 01:52:45,568
to bunkers with
Stars of David on the doors,

1244
01:52:45,663 --> 01:52:49,404
and signs that said
"Bath and Inhalation Room. "

1245
01:52:49,500 --> 01:52:51,610
SS gave them soap.

1246
01:52:51,705 --> 01:52:56,597
They told them to breathe all the time
because it's good for disinfecting.

1247
01:52:56,693 --> 01:52:59,379
And then they gassed them.

1248
01:53:00,625 --> 01:53:03,119
Mila, why soaps?

1249
01:53:03,214 --> 01:53:05,673
So that they would agree
to go in, I think.

1250
01:53:05,708 --> 01:53:09,352
Come on, Mila, stop it. Your
bedtime stories are scaring everyone.

1251
01:53:09,387 --> 01:53:11,750
I just don't believe it.
Ja. You know it's ridiculous.

1252
01:53:11,846 --> 01:53:13,764
I don't believe it either.
I cannot believe it.

1253
01:53:13,861 --> 01:53:16,354
I didn't say I believed it.
I said I heard it.

1254
01:53:16,450 --> 01:53:19,615
From who? From somebody who heard
it from someone who was there.

1255
01:53:19,650 --> 01:53:22,109
You know,
if they were there,

1256
01:53:22,204 --> 01:53:24,985
they would
have been gassed.

1257
01:53:25,020 --> 01:53:27,766
Yes. It doesn't make any sense.

1258
01:53:27,863 --> 01:53:29,781
We're their work force.

1259
01:53:29,876 --> 01:53:33,521
What sense does it make
to kill your own work force?

1260
01:53:33,617 --> 01:53:38,316
To go to all this trouble of
assembling a work force only to-

1261
01:53:38,412 --> 01:53:41,542
No, it can't be true.

1262
01:53:41,577 --> 01:53:44,455
We are very, very
important for them.

1263
01:53:44,490 --> 01:53:47,715
Ja, we do now.
Good night.

1264
01:53:47,811 --> 01:53:50,689
Good night. Good night. Sweet dreams.

1265
01:53:58,820 --> 01:54:01,313
Attention, attention.

1266
01:54:01,409 --> 01:54:03,711
Everyone who is alive...

1267
01:54:03,807 --> 01:54:07,163
is to come
to the Appellplatz.

1268
01:54:07,260 --> 01:54:11,541
Attention, attention. Come, we
have to go to the Appellplatz.

1269
01:54:11,576 --> 01:54:12,727
Everyone who is alive...
The listmakers are here.

1270
01:54:12,822 --> 01:54:15,700
is to come to the Appellplatz.
There is going to be a selection.

1271
01:54:15,795 --> 01:54:20,207
Attention, attention.
Everyone who is alive...

1272
01:54:20,303 --> 01:54:24,043
is to come
to the Appellplatz.

1273
01:54:37,278 --> 01:54:39,196
Meine Herren.

1274
01:54:39,231 --> 01:54:43,286
Raz.!
Dwa.!

1275
01:54:43,321 --> 01:54:45,431
...die Hunderttausend
Ungarn kommen...

1276
01:54:47,444 --> 01:54:51,185
Alle in einer
Einzelreihe aufstellen!

1277
01:54:51,281 --> 01:54:55,213
You could afford
to lose some weight, Amon.

1278
01:54:55,309 --> 01:54:57,803
And you've got to
cut down on the cognac.

1279
01:54:57,838 --> 01:55:00,645
Morning.
What's going on?

1280
01:55:00,680 --> 01:55:03,557
It's another
semiannual physical.

1281
01:55:05,378 --> 01:55:09,982
There. Oh, I've, um, got another
shipment coming in of, uh-

1282
01:55:10,017 --> 01:55:12,093
What are they this time?

1283
01:55:12,188 --> 01:55:13,976
Hungarians.
Oh, ja, Hungarians.

1284
01:55:14,011 --> 01:55:17,559
We've got to separate the sick
from the healthy to make room.

1285
01:55:17,594 --> 01:55:21,395
Teraz! Teraz!

1286
01:55:28,588 --> 01:55:32,904
## Gute Nacht Mutter ##

1287
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:35,590
## Gute Nacht ##

1288
01:55:38,084 --> 01:55:41,536
Das darf nicht
bis zum Abend dauern.!

1290

Let me help you.

1291
01:55:57,744 --> 01:56:00,525
Zack, zack, zack!

1292
01:56:04,170 --> 01:56:08,486
We've got to go out there.

1293
01:56:10,691 --> 01:56:13,245
Don't go.

1294
01:56:13,280 --> 01:56:15,295
Look alive, Rebeka.

1295
01:56:15,391 --> 01:56:17,561
Schneller!

1296
01:56:17,596 --> 01:56:21,625
## Gute Nacht Mutter ##

1297
01:56:21,660 --> 01:56:24,040

## Gute Nacht ##

1299
01:56:37,353 --> 01:56:40,039
That's my mechanic.

1300
01:56:40,134 --> 01:56:43,395
Whose bright idea was it
to get rid of him?

1301
01:56:49,246 --> 01:56:52,699
Ruszaj sie.!
Naokolo.!

1302

Wez gleboki oddech.

##Du hast verziehen mir

1311

No, no, no. Wait, go away. She can work.

1312
01:57:46,598 --> 01:57:50,243
Come here. Look, separate
the sick from the healthy.

1313
01:57:50,338 --> 01:57:52,736
Those who can work and those
who can't. She can work.

1314
01:57:52,771 --> 01:57:56,860
You can work,
you can come.

1315
01:57:57,051 --> 01:57:59,353
Ruszac sie!
Szybciej!

1316
01:58:07,601 --> 01:58:12,301
##Es war einmal

##Die sieht er an er weint

Those not selected for transport,
put your clothes back on.

1333
01:59:23,751 --> 01:59:28,163
Men, go back to the barracks.
Return to the barracks.

1334
01:59:32,766 --> 01:59:35,931
Go back to the barracks.

1335
01:59:39,288 --> 01:59:41,782
Oh, my God!

Ab in die Barracke.!
In die Barracke mit euch.!

1344
02:00:29,159 --> 02:00:33,056
I didn't see him! They're hiding.
I'm telling you, they're hiding.

1345
02:00:33,091 --> 02:00:36,544
I know Danka. She took them to a good
place. She took all of them together.

1346
02:00:36,579 --> 02:00:39,583
Zurueck in die Barracken!

1347
02:00:39,618 --> 02:00:42,587
##... mein Paradies ##

1348
02:00:42,682 --> 02:00:52,081
##Mamatschi solche
Pferde wollte ich nicht ##

1349
02:00:57,931 --> 02:01:03,398
Find your own hiding place. There's
no room for you here. Go away, quick!

1350
02:01:25,936 --> 02:01:28,814
Get out. This is our place.
Get out!

1351
02:01:51,639 --> 02:01:54,805
Oskar!
Amon. Gentlemen.

1352
02:01:54,900 --> 02:01:58,065
Why didn't you call me? I tried
to call you. Here, Hujar, move.

1353
02:01:58,161 --> 02:02:00,846
Quite a picnic, huh? Madritsch. Oskar.

1354
02:02:00,942 --> 02:02:03,628
I'm running a little late. This
is taking longer than I thought.

1355
02:02:03,723 --> 02:02:06,793
A drink? Something cold. Bowle.

1356
02:02:06,888 --> 02:02:08,998
The Bowle.

1357
02:02:10,628 --> 02:02:13,698
Oh, another
beautiful day.

1358
02:02:16,383 --> 02:02:18,589
Cisza.! Spokoj.!

1359
02:02:26,261 --> 02:02:28,467
Die Beladung der Transportwagen
ist beendet.

1360
02:02:28,563 --> 02:02:30,961
Wir sind abfahrbereit.

1361
02:02:31,057 --> 02:02:33,419
Wody.!
Wody.!

1362
02:02:33,454 --> 02:02:36,427
Wasser... wasser.

1363
02:02:42,470 --> 02:02:46,305
Wohlsein.
Oh, thank you.

1364
02:02:51,869 --> 02:02:56,952
What do you say we get your fire hoses
out here and hose down the cars? Thank you.

1365
02:02:58,965 --> 02:03:01,267
Indulge me.

1366
02:03:02,706 --> 02:03:04,816
Hujar.
Yes, sir.

1367
02:03:04,912 --> 02:03:08,364
- Go bring the fire hoses.
- Where's the fire?

1368
02:03:11,817 --> 02:03:15,366
In the windows.
That's it, that's it.

1369
02:03:15,461 --> 02:03:19,393
On the roof. That's it, good,
good. In the window, in the window.

1370
02:03:22,175 --> 02:03:25,880
Come on. Come on.

1371
02:03:25,915 --> 02:03:27,834
That's it, more, more.

1372
02:03:31,861 --> 02:03:35,602
That's it, that's it.
More, more.

1373
02:03:35,698 --> 02:03:39,150
This is really cruel, Oskar.
You are giving them hope.

1374
02:03:39,185 --> 02:03:42,890
You shouldn't do that.
That's cruel.!

1375
02:03:42,987 --> 02:03:46,343
Come on, try and reach
the far end. Look out-

1376
02:03:46,440 --> 02:03:49,316
Water.! More water.!

1377
02:03:51,523 --> 02:03:55,263
I've got some 200-meter
hoses back at Emalia.

1378
02:03:55,358 --> 02:03:57,180
I have 20 meters
at home in my garden.

1379
02:03:57,277 --> 02:03:59,387
We can reach
the cars at the end.

1380
02:03:59,422 --> 02:04:01,784
What? What?

1381
02:04:01,881 --> 02:04:06,005
Huh?

1382
02:04:06,100 --> 02:04:08,306
Hujar.
Yeah, sure.

1383
02:04:26,144 --> 02:04:28,638
Don't forget
the roof.

1384
02:04:28,734 --> 02:04:31,419
On the roof
on the other side.

1385
02:04:31,516 --> 02:04:35,639
Water.!

1386
02:04:37,941 --> 02:04:40,338
Scharfuehrer,
every time the train stops,

1387
02:04:40,373 --> 02:04:42,736
you open the doors,
you give them water, ja?

1388
02:04:42,771 --> 02:04:45,614
Jawohl. Ja. This car! This car!

1389
02:05:09,111 --> 02:05:12,276
I'm not saying you'll
regret it, but you might.

1390
02:05:12,371 --> 02:05:16,975
You should be aware of that.
We will have to risk regret.

1391
02:05:17,070 --> 02:05:20,715
All right, sure. It's a nice
day. I'll go for a drive with you.

1392
02:05:54,282 --> 02:05:56,584
What about you?

1393
02:05:56,681 --> 02:06:00,708
I violated the
"Race and Resettlement Act. "

1394
02:06:00,805 --> 02:06:04,640
Though I doubt anyone can point
out the actual provision to me.

1395
02:06:04,737 --> 02:06:07,901
I kissed a Jewish girl.

1396
02:06:11,450 --> 02:06:14,231
Did your prick fall off?

1397
02:06:32,069 --> 02:06:35,043
He likes women.

1398
02:06:36,002 --> 02:06:39,071
He likes
good-looking women.

1399
02:06:40,605 --> 02:06:44,729
He sees a beautiful woman,
he doesn't think.

1400
02:06:44,826 --> 02:06:47,510
I mean,

1401
02:06:47,607 --> 02:06:49,956
he has so many women.

1402
02:06:49,991 --> 02:06:52,271
And they love him.

1403
02:06:52,306 --> 02:06:55,244
Ja, they love him. I mean,
he is married, ja, but he's-

1404
02:06:55,279 --> 02:07:00,267
All right, it's not
- She was Jewish. He shouldn't have done it.

1405
02:07:00,362 --> 02:07:03,911
But, you didn't see this girl.

1406
02:07:04,007 --> 02:07:07,267
I saw this girl.
This girl was, woof-

1407
02:07:07,364 --> 02:07:09,474
She was very good-looking.

1408
02:07:12,734 --> 02:07:15,420
They cast a spell on you,
you know, theJews.

1409
02:07:15,515 --> 02:07:18,009
When you work closely with them,
like I do, you see this.

1410
02:07:18,105 --> 02:07:21,846
They have this power. It's like a virus.
Some of my men are infected with this virus.

1411
02:07:21,881 --> 02:07:24,147
They should be pitied, not punished.
They should receive treatment.

1412
02:07:24,182 --> 02:07:27,121
This is as real as typhus.
I see this all the time.

1413
02:07:27,156 --> 02:07:30,094
It's a matter of money?
Hmm?

1414
02:07:30,189 --> 02:07:32,779
You're offering me
a bribe?

1415
02:07:34,601 --> 02:07:39,396
A bribe? No. No, please.
It's a gratuity.

1416
02:07:39,492 --> 02:07:41,314
Heil Hitler.!

1417
02:07:45,535 --> 02:07:47,740
Hello, Amon.

1418
02:07:50,234 --> 02:07:52,151
Sit down.

1419
02:07:54,837 --> 02:07:58,385
We give you Jewish girls
at five marks a day, Oskar.

1420
02:07:58,482 --> 02:08:00,400
You should kiss us,
not them.

1421
02:08:00,496 --> 02:08:04,428
God forbid you ever get
a real taste forJewish skirt.

1422
02:08:04,524 --> 02:08:07,784
There's no future in it.
They don't have a future.

1423
02:08:07,881 --> 02:08:12,580
That's not just good,
old-fashioned,Jew-hating talk.

1424
02:08:12,615 --> 02:08:15,361
It's policy now.

1425
02:08:16,597 --> 02:08:20,337
Ja, schoen gefangen! Gut!

1426
02:08:25,804 --> 02:08:29,832
Nochmal,ja! Schoen!

1427
02:08:58,604 --> 02:09:01,098
Also los! Bewegung!

1428
02:09:01,194 --> 02:09:04,934
Schneller hier.!
Zack, zack, zack.!

1429
02:09:05,030 --> 02:09:07,235
Beweg deinen Arsch!

1430
02:09:07,332 --> 02:09:09,826
Das geht
auch schneller.!

1431
02:09:09,921 --> 02:09:12,763
Bewegt euch.!
Schlaft nicht ein.!

1432
02:09:12,798 --> 02:09:16,826
Nur die ganzen Fetzen,
nicht das Gemuese.!

1433
02:09:21,622 --> 02:09:23,540
Was ist denn hier los?

1434
02:09:23,636 --> 02:09:26,225
Komm, das kannst du mit den
Haenden machen, fass da vorn an.!

1435
02:09:26,260 --> 02:09:27,759
Hier.!

1436
02:09:27,856 --> 02:09:30,541
Los, raus mit den Fetzen.!
Die Kleinteile lass liegen.!

1437
02:09:39,460 --> 02:09:43,105
Jetzt macht aber schnell, verdammt
noch mal.! Weg mit den Scheissdingern.!

1438
02:09:51,448 --> 02:09:54,901
So ist es.! Walhalla.!
Walhalla laeuft hier.!

1439
02:09:59,984 --> 02:10:02,190
Can you believe this?

1440
02:10:02,285 --> 02:10:05,451
As if I don't have enough to do,
they come up with this?

1441
02:10:05,547 --> 02:10:09,348
I have to find every rag
buried up here and burn it.

1442
02:10:09,383 --> 02:10:13,986
The party's over, Oskar. They're closing
us down, sending everybody to Auschwitz.

1443
02:10:14,083 --> 02:10:16,385
When? I don't know. As soon
as I can arrange the shipments.

1444
02:10:16,480 --> 02:10:20,125
Maybe 30, 40 days.
That ought to be fun.

1445
02:10:39,498 --> 02:10:42,663
I've been talking to Goeth.
I know the destination.

1446
02:10:42,758 --> 02:10:45,539
These are
the evacuation orders.

1447
02:10:45,636 --> 02:10:48,322
I'm to help organize the shipments,
put myself on the last train.

1448
02:10:48,357 --> 02:10:51,390
That's not what
I was going to say.

1449
02:10:51,486 --> 02:10:55,130
I made Goeth promise me
he'd put in a good word for you.

1450
02:10:55,227 --> 02:10:58,488
Nothing bad is going to happen to you
there. You'll receive special treatment.

1451
02:10:58,583 --> 02:11:02,420
The directives coming in from Berlin mention
"Special Treatment" more and more often.

1452
02:11:02,515 --> 02:11:06,160
I'd like to think that's not what
you mean. Preferential treatment.

1453
02:11:06,255 --> 02:11:11,530
- Do we have to invent a whole new language?
- I think so.

1454
02:11:12,873 --> 02:11:15,367
You're staying,
I take it.

1455
02:11:19,203 --> 02:11:23,423
In Krakow? What on earth for? What
for? You have a business to run.

1456
02:11:23,458 --> 02:11:27,068
Of course, you'll have to hire
new workers. Poles, I guess.

1457
02:11:27,163 --> 02:11:30,712
They cost
a little more, but-

1458
02:11:31,671 --> 02:11:33,973
What are you going to do?

1459
02:11:37,713 --> 02:11:40,686
You run my business.

1460
02:11:42,796 --> 02:11:45,098
No, I'm going home.

1461
02:11:45,194 --> 02:11:50,469
I've done what I came here for. I've got more
money than any man could spend in a lifetime.

1462
02:12:00,827 --> 02:12:05,718
Someday, this is all
going to end, you know.

1463
02:12:09,553 --> 02:12:12,239
I was going to say
we'll have a drink then.

1464
02:12:16,268 --> 02:12:19,720
I think I better
have it now.

1465
02:12:40,916 --> 02:12:43,565
##Bible says ##

1466
02:12:43,600 --> 02:12:47,149
##And it still is news ##

1467
02:12:47,245 --> 02:12:50,410
##Mama may have ##

1468
02:12:50,445 --> 02:12:53,575
##Papa may have ##

1469
02:12:53,671 --> 02:12:56,644
##But God bless the child ##

1470
02:12:56,741 --> 02:13:02,398
## That's got his own ##

1471
02:13:05,276 --> 02:13:10,262
## Yes, the strong gets more ##

1472
02:13:10,359 --> 02:13:13,715
## While the weak ones fade ##

1473
02:13:13,812 --> 02:13:16,880
##Empty pockets don't ##

1474
02:13:16,976 --> 02:13:20,620
##Ever make the grade ##

1475
02:13:20,717 --> 02:13:23,978
##Mama may have ##

1476
02:13:24,073 --> 02:13:27,238
##Papa may have ##

1477
02:13:27,334 --> 02:13:30,307
##But God bless the child ##

1478
02:13:30,403 --> 02:13:35,774
## That's got his own ##

1479
02:13:40,665 --> 02:13:43,891
##Money ##

1480
02:13:43,926 --> 02:13:48,338
## You've got lots of friends ##

1481
02:13:48,433 --> 02:13:51,023
## They're pounding on your-####

1482
02:13:51,119 --> 02:13:55,147
I don't understand.
I mean,you want these people?

1483
02:13:55,243 --> 02:13:57,737
"These people"? My
people, I want my people.

1484
02:13:57,832 --> 02:14:00,710
Who are you, Moses?
Come on, what is this?

1485
02:14:00,806 --> 02:14:03,587
Where's the money in this? Where's
the scam? It's good business.

1486
02:14:03,682 --> 02:14:05,889
It's good business
in your opinion.

1487
02:14:05,984 --> 02:14:09,917
You've got to move them, the
equipment, everything to Czechoslovakia.

1488
02:14:10,013 --> 02:14:13,081
Pay for all that and build another
camp. Doesn't make any sense.

1489
02:14:13,178 --> 02:14:16,246
Look, Amon
- It's good for me. You're not telling me something.

1490
02:14:16,342 --> 02:14:19,028
I know them. I'm familiar with
them. I don't have to train them.

1491
02:14:19,124 --> 02:14:20,850
You're not telling me something. It's
good for you. I'll compensate you.

1492
02:14:20,885 --> 02:14:23,631
That's right.
It's good for the Army.

1493
02:14:23,728 --> 02:14:26,125
You know what I'm going to make? What?

1494
02:14:26,220 --> 02:14:28,427
Artillery shells.
Everyone is!

1495
02:14:28,522 --> 02:14:30,344
Tank shells, they need
that. Tanks shells, ja.

1496
02:14:30,441 --> 02:14:32,838
Everybody's happy.
Except me.

1497
02:14:32,935 --> 02:14:35,811
You're probably
scamming me somehow.

1498
02:14:35,907 --> 02:14:38,785
If I'm making 100,
you've got to be making 300.

1499
02:14:38,880 --> 02:14:42,142
If you admit to 300, then
it's 400 actually. But how?

1500
02:14:42,177 --> 02:14:45,785
I just told you.
You did, but you didn't.

1501
02:14:47,033 --> 02:14:49,874
Ah, ja, all right,
don't tell me.

1502
02:14:49,909 --> 02:14:54,033
I'll go along with it. It's just
irritating I can't work it out.

1503
02:14:54,130 --> 02:14:58,637
Look, all you have to do is
tell me what it's worth to you.

1504
02:14:58,734 --> 02:15:01,323
What's a person worth
to you? No, no, no, no.

1505
02:15:01,418 --> 02:15:04,296
What's one worth to you?

1506
02:15:11,873 --> 02:15:15,325
Poldek Pfefferberg.
Mila Pfefferberg.

1507
02:15:15,421 --> 02:15:18,646
And, uh-

1508
02:15:18,681 --> 02:15:20,600
Uh, Stagel, Stagel-

1509
02:15:20,696 --> 02:15:22,950
Paul.
Paul Stagel.

1510
02:15:22,985 --> 02:15:25,169
Doctor.

1511
02:15:25,204 --> 02:15:29,999
The investors. I want
all of them. Yes, sir.

1512
02:15:30,034 --> 02:15:32,588
Uh, Fischer.
Ismail Fischer.

1513
02:15:32,684 --> 02:15:35,754
Fischer, Ismail.

1514
02:15:35,849 --> 02:15:38,726
Josef Scharf. One moment,
sir. I'm sorry, sir.

1515
02:15:38,822 --> 02:15:40,740
Come on, Stern.
Scharf, Scharf.

1516
02:15:43,713 --> 02:15:47,645
The children.
All the children.

1517
02:15:51,769 --> 02:15:53,592
Herbert Stier.
Thank you.

1518
02:15:53,687 --> 02:15:57,716
How many?
Four hundred, 450.

1519
02:16:00,209 --> 02:16:02,127
More, more.

1520
02:16:07,210 --> 02:16:09,704
Good morning.

1521
02:16:25,049 --> 02:16:30,228
Think of Feigenbaum,Jakob.
Wolf. Wolf Wein.

1522
02:16:34,256 --> 02:16:38,092
Lutek,Jakob,
Nacha. Yes? Nacha.

1523
02:16:38,127 --> 02:16:40,363
Nacha, that's right.

1524
02:16:40,398 --> 02:16:42,600
And Wolf.

1525
02:16:42,695 --> 02:16:45,094
How many?

1526
02:16:46,627 --> 02:16:49,854
Six hundred.
More.

1527
02:16:49,889 --> 02:16:52,539
You can do
the same thing I'm doing.

1528
02:16:52,574 --> 02:16:55,225
You might even make
money at it. I don't know.

1529
02:16:55,260 --> 02:16:57,945
Come on,Julius, I know about the
extra food and clothes you give them.

1530
02:16:58,041 --> 02:17:01,014
Paid for out of your own pocket.
If we make a combined approach,

1531
02:17:01,109 --> 02:17:03,473
we could get more than 4,000
out, mine and yours. Oskar-

1532
02:17:03,508 --> 02:17:06,768
We could relocate them in
something like safety, in Moravia.

1533
02:17:06,864 --> 02:17:09,262
I don't know.

1534
02:17:11,372 --> 02:17:15,112
How many cigarettes have
you smoked tonight? Too many.

1535
02:17:15,208 --> 02:17:19,620
For every one-
you smoke, I smoke half.

1536
02:17:19,715 --> 02:17:22,174
I've done all I can.
I will not accept that.

1537
02:17:22,209 --> 02:17:25,374
No, Oskar, I can't do anymore.
I will not accept that.

1538
02:17:25,470 --> 02:17:27,100
No.

1539
02:17:36,691 --> 02:17:39,280
How many? How many? Eight
hundred and fifty, give or take.

1540
02:17:39,377 --> 02:17:43,117
Give or take what, Stern?
Count them. How many?

1541
02:17:53,283 --> 02:17:56,735
That's it.
You can finish that page.

1542
02:18:01,339 --> 02:18:05,044
What... did... Goeth...
say about this?

1543
02:18:05,079 --> 02:18:08,820
You just told him how
many people you needed and-

1544
02:18:11,793 --> 02:18:13,999
You're not buying them.

1545
02:18:16,300 --> 02:18:19,274
You're buying them? You're paying
him for each of these names?

1546
02:18:19,369 --> 02:18:22,631
If you were still working for me,
I'd expect you to talk me out of it.

1547
02:18:22,726 --> 02:18:25,952
It's costing me
a fortune.

1548
02:18:25,987 --> 02:18:29,919
Finish the page and leave
one space at the bottom.

1549
02:18:51,114 --> 02:18:53,225
Look.

1550
02:18:58,595 --> 02:19:02,623
The list is
an absolute good.

1551
02:19:02,720 --> 02:19:05,405
The list... is life.

1552
02:19:06,939 --> 02:19:12,119
All around its margins
lies the gulf.

1553
02:19:12,214 --> 02:19:15,954
Oskar, there's a clerical error
here at the bottom of the last page.

1554
02:19:16,051 --> 02:19:18,640
No, there's one more name
I want to put there.

1555
02:19:18,735 --> 02:19:23,051
I'll never fid a maid as well trained as
her at Brinnlitz. They are all country girls.

1556
02:19:23,148 --> 02:19:25,066
No.

1557
02:19:34,368 --> 02:19:36,190
No.

1558
02:19:36,287 --> 02:19:38,265
One hand of 21.
No.

1559
02:19:38,300 --> 02:19:41,178
If you win, I pay you
7,400 Reichsmark. No.

1560
02:19:41,273 --> 02:19:44,535
Hit a natural, I make it 14,800. No.

1561
02:19:44,631 --> 02:19:47,412
If I win,
the girl goes on my list.

1562
02:19:47,507 --> 02:19:51,248
I can't wager Helen in
a card game. Why not?

1563
02:19:51,344 --> 02:19:54,222
Wouldn't be right. She's just going
to Auschwitz on Number Two anyway.

1564
02:19:54,317 --> 02:19:56,811
What difference does it make?
She's not going to Auschwitz.

1565
02:19:56,906 --> 02:20:00,551
I'd never do that to her. No, I want
her to come back to Vienna with me.

1566
02:20:00,647 --> 02:20:03,524
I want her to come
to work for me there.

1567
02:20:03,619 --> 02:20:07,936
I want to grow old
with her. Are you mad?

1568
02:20:08,032 --> 02:20:13,402
Amon, you can't take her to Vienna
with you. No, of course I can't.

1569
02:20:13,437 --> 02:20:16,916
That's what I'd like to do.

1570
02:20:16,951 --> 02:20:22,130
What I can do, if I'm any sort of a
man, is the next most merciful thing.

1571
02:20:22,225 --> 02:20:26,829
I should take her into the woods and shoot
her painlessly in the back of the head.

1572
02:20:36,325 --> 02:20:39,777
What was it you said
for a natural 21?

1573
02:20:39,873 --> 02:20:43,038
Was it 14,800?

1574
02:20:43,133 --> 02:20:45,340
Schindlerjuden to these tables.!
Say your names clearly.

1591
02:21:31,026 --> 02:21:33,676
Horowitz, Dolek.

1592
02:21:33,711 --> 02:21:36,074
Adam Levy.

1593
02:21:36,170 --> 02:21:38,472
Marcel Goldberg.

1594
02:21:38,567 --> 02:21:41,541
Klipstein, Isak David.

1595
02:21:41,576 --> 02:21:43,716
Altmann, Eduard.

1596
02:21:43,751 --> 02:21:45,857

Zuckermann,Jetti.

1601
02:21:54,872 --> 02:21:57,078
Helen Hirsch.

1602
02:21:59,188 --> 02:22:02,928
The worst is over.

1603
02:22:03,023 --> 02:22:06,764
Men to this transport
and women to this transport.

1604
02:22:06,860 --> 02:22:11,559
Be careful. Men to this transport
and women to this transport.

1605
02:22:11,655 --> 02:22:15,779
Watch your step. Men to this
transport and women to this transport.

1606
02:22:52,608 --> 02:22:56,600
Wonderful, Olek, wonderful.

1607
02:22:56,635 --> 02:23:00,856
You know how we make
ice into water?

1608
02:23:00,951 --> 02:23:04,116
Olek, get another one!

1609
02:23:40,848 --> 02:23:43,534
Alle in eine Einzelreihe
aufstellen!

1610
02:23:43,630 --> 02:23:48,713
You'll be pleased with the level of
efficiency I get from these workers.

1611
02:23:50,343 --> 02:23:52,610
Budzyn, under my command,

1612
02:23:52,645 --> 02:23:55,714
was the envy of every other
commandant in the labor camp system.

1613
02:23:55,809 --> 02:23:56,769
The prisoners, however
- Excuse me.

1614
02:23:56,865 --> 02:23:59,550
They would have rather
been somewhere else.

1615
02:24:13,072 --> 02:24:16,909
The train with the women
has already left Plaszow...

1616
02:24:17,006 --> 02:24:20,362
and will be arriving
here very shortly.

1617
02:24:20,458 --> 02:24:23,012
I know you've had
a long journey.

1618
02:24:23,047 --> 02:24:26,213
But it's only a short walk
further to the factory...

1619
02:24:26,308 --> 02:24:31,486
where hot soup and bread
is waiting for you.

1620
02:24:31,583 --> 02:24:33,597
Welcome to Brinnlitz!

1621
02:24:42,804 --> 02:24:46,257
Beans in tsunt?
Beans are the best.

1622
02:24:46,292 --> 02:24:48,270
I don't like beans.

1623
02:24:48,367 --> 02:24:51,292
Beans and meat
and potatoes and bread.

1624
02:24:51,327 --> 02:24:54,217
That's not the way
you make tsunt.

1625
02:24:57,766 --> 02:25:01,026
Eggs in tsunt?
Yes!

1626
02:25:03,616 --> 02:25:07,500
I don't like tsunt.
No,you don't.

1627
02:25:07,535 --> 02:25:11,384
What do you like?
I like caviar.

1628
02:25:11,480 --> 02:25:13,878
One day on the fire.

1629
02:26:16,984 --> 02:26:19,286
Alle vorm Wagen
in Position bleiben.

1630
02:26:20,724 --> 02:26:23,950
Alle in der Gruppe
zusammenbleiben.

1631

Where are the listmakers?
Where are the tables?

1644
02:27:19,516 --> 02:27:22,200
Move the line.!

1645
02:27:22,297 --> 02:27:24,599
'Raus mit euch!

1646
02:27:24,694 --> 02:27:26,996

Mama, where are we?

Seventeen, 18, 20-
They're in Auschwitz.

1654
02:27:46,273 --> 02:27:49,438
The train was never routed
here. Apaperwork mistake.

1655
02:27:56,439 --> 02:27:57,974
Szybciej! Szybko!

1674
02:31:36,641 --> 02:31:39,327
Die Hand auf
die Schulter.!

1675
02:31:39,422 --> 02:31:42,300
How old are you, Mother?
Sixty-eight.

1676
02:31:42,395 --> 02:31:47,286
Cough for me, Mother. They say to
fall against the fence is a kindness.

1677
02:31:47,383 --> 02:31:50,356
Don't kill yourself
against the fence, Clara.

1678
02:31:50,451 --> 02:31:54,191
If you do, you'll never
know what happened to you.

1679
02:31:54,288 --> 02:31:58,412
How old are you,
Mother? Sixty-six, sir.

1680
02:31:58,447 --> 02:32:00,582
Sir?
Good morning.

1681
02:32:00,617 --> 02:32:03,495
A mistake has been made. We
are not supposed to be here.

1682
02:32:03,590 --> 02:32:07,138
We work for Oskar Schindler.
We are SchindlerJews.

1683
02:32:07,235 --> 02:32:10,591
Who is Oskar Schindler?
He had a factory in Krakow.

1684
02:32:10,688 --> 02:32:13,852
Enamelware.
A potmaker.

1685
02:32:13,887 --> 02:32:17,017
How old are you, Mother?

1686
02:32:21,430 --> 02:32:25,744
You are not the only
industrialist who needs labor,

1687
02:32:25,841 --> 02:32:29,389
Herr Schindler.

1688
02:32:29,486 --> 02:32:32,267
I remember earlier this
year, I.G. Farben ordered...

1689
02:32:32,362 --> 02:32:37,925
a trainload of Hungarians
for his chemical factory.

1690
02:32:38,021 --> 02:32:41,761
The train came in
through the archway,

1691
02:32:41,857 --> 02:32:46,844
and the officer in charge of the
selection went immediately to work...

1692
02:32:46,940 --> 02:32:50,297
and sent 2,000
of them...

1693
02:32:50,392 --> 02:32:53,366
straightaway
to Special Treatment.

1694
02:32:53,462 --> 02:32:58,448
It is not my task to interfere with
the processes that take place down here.

1695
02:33:00,175 --> 02:33:05,450
Why do you think I can help
you if I can't help I.G. Farben?

1696
02:33:05,485 --> 02:33:07,752
Allow me to express
the reason.

1697
02:33:16,767 --> 02:33:19,932
I'm not making
any judgment about you.

1698
02:33:20,028 --> 02:33:23,577
It's just that I know
that in the coming months...

1699
02:33:23,672 --> 02:33:27,701
we're all going
to need portable wealth.

1700
02:33:28,755 --> 02:33:31,345
I could have you arrested.

1701
02:33:31,441 --> 02:33:35,757
I'm protected by powerful
friends. You should know that.

1702
02:33:38,826 --> 02:33:42,662
I do not say
I am accepting them.

1703
02:33:42,758 --> 02:33:47,361
All I say is, I'm not comfortable
with them on the table.

1704
02:34:00,692 --> 02:34:03,858
I have a shipment
coming in tomorrow.

1705
02:34:03,953 --> 02:34:06,255
I'll cut you
300 units from it.

1706
02:34:06,290 --> 02:34:10,091
New ones.
These are fresh.

1707
02:34:13,640 --> 02:34:16,900
The train comes, we turn
it around. Mmm, yes, yes.

1708
02:34:16,935 --> 02:34:19,106
It's yours.
I understand.

1709
02:34:19,202 --> 02:34:21,696
I want these.

1710
02:34:23,997 --> 02:34:26,779
You shouldn't
get stuck on names.

1711
02:34:34,260 --> 02:34:38,384
That's right. It creates
a lot of paperwork.

1712
02:34:38,863 --> 02:34:42,508
Zoldinger, Ernestina.!
Waldergrun, Hilda.!

1713
02:34:42,603 --> 02:34:44,713
Waldergrun, Leonora.!

1714
02:34:44,810 --> 02:34:48,070
Laast, Anna!
Pfefferberg, Mila!

1715
02:34:48,166 --> 02:34:51,523
Dresner, Chaja!
Dresner, Danka!

1716
02:34:51,618 --> 02:34:55,168
Nussbaum, Sidonia!
Rosner, Manci!

1717
02:34:55,263 --> 02:35:00,251
Hirsch, Helen.! Grosz, Chaja
Sara.! Seelenfreund, Estella.!

1718
02:35:13,198 --> 02:35:17,322
Schneller laufen.!
Schneller laufen.! Schneller.!

1719
02:35:17,417 --> 02:35:21,349
Schneller.! Schneller.!
Mach schon.! Voran.!

1720
02:35:23,364 --> 02:35:26,145
Los, los, los.!
Schneller.!

1721
02:35:27,872 --> 02:35:31,804
- Schneller!
- Bewegt euch!

1722
02:35:31,899 --> 02:35:34,872
Bojcie sie!
Bojcie sie!

1723
02:35:38,612 --> 02:35:42,737
No! No! No!

1724
02:35:47,053 --> 02:35:50,793
Maedchen, los jetzt aber!
Jetzt aber Tempo!

1725
02:35:56,547 --> 02:36:00,096
No! No! No!

1726
02:36:00,192 --> 02:36:03,549
Danka! Danka! Danka!

1727
02:36:03,644 --> 02:36:05,851
No! No! No!

1728
02:36:07,865 --> 02:36:11,221
Hey.! Hey.! Hey.!
What are you doing?

1729
02:36:11,318 --> 02:36:16,401
These are mine! These are my
workers! They should be on my train!

1730
02:36:16,436 --> 02:36:18,990
They're skilled munitions
workers! They're essential!

1731
02:36:19,025 --> 02:36:22,730
Essential girls!

1732
02:36:22,826 --> 02:36:27,909
Their fingers polish the insides
of shell metal casings.

1733
02:36:28,005 --> 02:36:31,745
How else am I to polish the inside
of a.45 millimeter shell casing?

1734
02:36:31,841 --> 02:36:35,486
You tell me.
You tell me!

1735
02:36:35,581 --> 02:36:40,185
Back on the train!
Back on the train!

1736
02:38:30,382 --> 02:38:34,566
Under Department "W"
provisions,

1737
02:38:34,601 --> 02:38:38,821
it is unlawful to kill
a worker without just cause.

1738
02:38:38,917 --> 02:38:41,794
Under the Businesses
Compensation Fund,

1739
02:38:41,891 --> 02:38:46,015
I am entitled to file
damage claims for such deaths.

1740
02:38:46,110 --> 02:38:48,891
If you shoot
without thinking,

1741
02:38:48,988 --> 02:38:52,536
you go to prison,
I get paid.

1742
02:38:52,631 --> 02:38:55,187
That's how it works.

1743
02:38:55,222 --> 02:38:59,441
So, there will be no
summary executions here.

1744
02:39:01,168 --> 02:39:05,772
There will be no interference
of any kind with production.

1745
02:39:05,867 --> 02:39:10,662
In hopes of ensuring that, guards will no
longer be allowed on the factory floor...

1746
02:39:10,758 --> 02:39:14,115
without my authorization.

1747
02:39:18,911 --> 02:39:22,938
For your cooperation,
you have my gratitude.

1748
02:39:23,994 --> 02:39:26,199
Come on, come.

1749
02:39:26,295 --> 02:39:28,597
Mensch, seitJahren hab' ich
so etwas nicht mehr gesehen.

1750
02:39:28,693 --> 02:39:32,242
Come on, boys, come.
Guck dir mal die Buddeln an!

1751
02:39:32,625 --> 02:39:37,036
Et dimitte nobis debita nostra,

1752
02:39:37,133 --> 02:39:40,873
sicut et nos dimittimus...

1753
02:39:40,969 --> 02:39:45,428
...quotidianum da nobis hodie,

1754
02:39:45,463 --> 02:39:49,888
et dimitte nobis
debita nostra...

1755
02:39:49,923 --> 02:39:53,245
sicut et nos dimittimus...

1756
02:39:53,340 --> 02:39:56,122
debitoribus nostris-

1757
02:39:56,218 --> 02:40:01,397
No doorman or maitre d'
will ever mistake you again.

1758
02:40:01,493 --> 02:40:03,890
I promise.

1759
02:40:03,987 --> 02:40:06,097
...sed libera nos a malo.

1760
02:40:07,727 --> 02:40:10,604
Itzhak.

1761
02:40:10,700 --> 02:40:14,345
This is Itzhak Stern, my accountant. Itzhak
- You must be Mrs. Schindler.

1762
02:40:14,440 --> 02:40:16,837
It's a pleasure. Emilie has
volunteered to work in the clinic.

1763
02:40:16,934 --> 02:40:18,756
Very generous of you. I know.

1764
02:40:18,852 --> 02:40:21,406
We need to talk
when you have a moment.

1765
02:40:21,441 --> 02:40:23,935
This is my wife, Stern. I don't
keep any secrets from my spouse.

1766
02:40:24,031 --> 02:40:27,004
Oskar, please, attend to business.
It's much more attractive.

1767
02:40:27,100 --> 02:40:28,922
Madam.
Hello.

1768
02:40:29,018 --> 02:40:31,511
What is it? We received an angry
complaint from the Armaments Board.

1769
02:40:31,608 --> 02:40:33,683
The artillery shells,
tank shells, rocket casings-

1770
02:40:33,718 --> 02:40:37,074
Apparently all of them have failed quality
control tests. That's to be expected.

1771
02:40:37,170 --> 02:40:40,526
Start-up problems. This isn't pots
and pans. This is a precise business.

1772
02:40:40,561 --> 02:40:42,061
I'll write them a letter.
They're withholding payment.

1773
02:40:42,157 --> 02:40:46,185
Sure, so would I, so would you. I wouldn't
worry. We'll get it right one of these days.

1774
02:40:46,220 --> 02:40:50,117
There's a rumor you've been going
around miscalibrating the machines.

1775
02:40:50,789 --> 02:40:55,200
They could shut us down,
send us back to Auschwitz.

1776
02:40:55,872 --> 02:40:58,750
I'll call around, find out
where we can buy shells.

1777
02:40:58,845 --> 02:41:01,722
Pass them off as ours. I don't see the
difference whether they're made here-

1778
02:41:01,818 --> 02:41:04,599
You don't see a difference? I see a
difference. You lose a lot of money.

1779
02:41:04,695 --> 02:41:07,860
Fewer shells will be made. Stern,
if this factory ever produces...

1780
02:41:07,957 --> 02:41:13,135
a shell that can actually be
fired, I'll be very unhappy.

1781
02:41:13,170 --> 02:41:16,013
Hello, madam.
How do you do?

1782
02:41:28,960 --> 02:41:33,276
How are you doing,
Rabbi? Rabbi!

1783
02:41:35,386 --> 02:41:37,208
Good, Herr Direktor.

1784
02:41:38,934 --> 02:41:41,332
Sun's going down.

1785
02:41:43,345 --> 02:41:45,839
Yes, it is.

1786
02:41:45,935 --> 02:41:49,484
What day is this? Friday?
It is Friday, isn't it?

1787
02:41:49,579 --> 02:41:51,593
Is it?

1788
02:41:55,717 --> 02:42:00,608
What's the matter with you? You
should be preparing for the Sabbath.

1789
02:42:00,643 --> 02:42:03,678
Shouldn't you?

1790
02:42:09,144 --> 02:42:13,747
I've got some wine.
In my office. Come.

1806
02:43:28,651 --> 02:43:33,447
Do you have any money,
uh, hidden away someplace...

1807
02:43:33,482 --> 02:43:36,131
that I don't know about?

1808
02:43:39,393 --> 02:43:41,790
No.

1809
02:43:46,010 --> 02:43:49,751
Why? Am I broke?

1810
02:43:49,846 --> 02:43:52,627
Uh-

1811
02:43:52,723 --> 02:43:55,505
Well-

1812
02:43:55,601 --> 02:44:01,068
Yesterday morning, at 241 a. m.,

1813
02:44:01,163 --> 02:44:05,575
at General Eisenhower's
headquarters,

1814
02:44:05,671 --> 02:44:08,260
General Jodl...

1815
02:44:08,356 --> 02:44:11,808
signed the "Act of
Unconditional Surrender"...

1816
02:44:11,843 --> 02:44:14,302
of all German land,

1817
02:44:14,399 --> 02:44:18,139
sea and air forces
in Europe...

1818
02:44:18,234 --> 02:44:22,036
to the Allied
Expeditionary Force,

1819
02:44:22,071 --> 02:44:26,195
and simultaneously
to the Soviet High Command.

1820
02:44:26,290 --> 02:44:30,511
The German war is,
therefore, at an end.

1821
02:44:30,606 --> 02:44:32,489
But let us not forget
for a moment-

1822
02:44:32,524 --> 02:44:36,648
I think it's time the guards
came into the factory.

1823
02:44:36,745 --> 02:44:39,778
Japan, with all
her treachery and greed-

1824
02:44:39,813 --> 02:44:45,088
The unconditional surrender of
Germany has just been announced.

1825
02:44:45,184 --> 02:44:49,020
At midnight tonight,
the war is over.

1826
02:44:51,035 --> 02:44:53,721
Tomorrow you'll
begin the process...

1827
02:44:53,816 --> 02:44:56,981
of looking for survivors
of your families.

1828
02:44:59,762 --> 02:45:04,366
In most cases,
you won't find them.

1829
02:45:05,517 --> 02:45:08,873
After six long years
of murder,

1830
02:45:08,969 --> 02:45:14,148
victims are being mourned
throughout the world.

1831
02:45:14,244 --> 02:45:17,182
We've survived.

1832
02:45:17,217 --> 02:45:21,245
Many of you have come up
to me and thanked me.

1833
02:45:23,163 --> 02:45:25,274
Thank yourselves.

1834
02:45:26,425 --> 02:45:28,822
Thank your fearless Stern...

1835
02:45:28,917 --> 02:45:32,179
and others among you
who worried about you...

1836
02:45:32,214 --> 02:45:35,919
and faced death
at every moment.

1837
02:45:38,605 --> 02:45:41,434
I'm a member
of the Nazi party.

1838
02:45:41,469 --> 02:45:44,160
I'm a munitions
manufacturer.

1839
02:45:44,195 --> 02:45:46,852
I'm a profiteer
of slave labor.

1840
02:45:46,948 --> 02:45:50,496
I am a criminal.

1841
02:45:50,593 --> 02:45:55,963
At midnight you'll be free,
and I'll be hunted.

1842
02:45:56,059 --> 02:45:59,321
I shall remain with you until
five minutes after midnight.

1843
02:45:59,416 --> 02:46:02,581
After which time,
and I hope you'll forgive me,

1844
02:46:02,677 --> 02:46:04,595
I have to flee.

1845
02:46:07,185 --> 02:46:10,890
I know you have received orders
from our Commandant,

1846
02:46:10,925 --> 02:46:15,241
which he has received from his superiors,
to dispose of the population of this camp.

1847
02:46:15,336 --> 02:46:18,406
Now would be
the time to do it.

1848
02:46:18,501 --> 02:46:23,776
Here they are, they're all here.
This is your opportunity.

1849
02:46:27,996 --> 02:46:30,490
Or you could leave,

1850
02:46:30,585 --> 02:46:33,942
and return to
your families as men...

1851
02:46:34,038 --> 02:46:37,587
instead of murderers.

1852
02:47:15,853 --> 02:47:19,882
In memory of the countless
victims among your people,

1853
02:47:19,917 --> 02:47:23,814
I ask us to observe
three minutes of silence.

1854
02:47:30,719 --> 02:47:35,706
Yetkadal veytkadosh shamy raboo.

02:47:51,853 --> 02:47:53,702

1867
02:48:16,946 --> 02:48:19,439
Thank you, Mr. Jereth.
Thank you, Mr. Jereth.

1868
02:48:19,474 --> 02:48:21,933
Thank you, Mr. Jereth.
Thank you, Mr. Jereth.

1869
02:48:21,968 --> 02:48:24,234
Open wide.

1870
02:48:25,674 --> 02:48:27,495
Thank you, Mr. Jereth.

1871
02:48:45,047 --> 02:48:47,828
Thank you,
Mr. Jereth.

1872
02:49:10,941 --> 02:49:14,778
As soon as peace occurs,
I want...

1873
02:49:14,873 --> 02:49:18,614
um, I want that cloth
distributed to the workers.

1874
02:49:18,710 --> 02:49:21,299
Two and a half meters each.

1875
02:49:21,395 --> 02:49:24,369
Also, each person is
to get a bottle of vodka.

1876
02:49:24,464 --> 02:49:27,245
They won't drink it.
They know its value.

1877
02:49:27,342 --> 02:49:30,698
Likewise for those Egipshi
cigarettes we organized.

1878
02:49:30,795 --> 02:49:34,535
It'll be done.
Everything you ask.

1879
02:49:53,236 --> 02:49:56,784
We've written a letter,
trying to explain things...

1880
02:49:56,881 --> 02:49:59,086
in case
you are captured.

1881
02:50:01,676 --> 02:50:04,649
Every worker
has signed it.

1882
02:50:14,528 --> 02:50:16,349
Thank you.

1883
02:50:41,860 --> 02:50:44,546
It is Hebrew,
from the Talmud.

1884
02:50:44,642 --> 02:50:50,108
It says, "Whoever saves one
life, saves the world entire. "

1885
02:51:27,416 --> 02:51:29,718
I could have got more out.

1886
02:51:31,924 --> 02:51:34,610
I could have got more.
I don't know.

1887
02:51:34,645 --> 02:51:36,972
If I just-

1888
02:51:37,007 --> 02:51:39,369
I could have got more.

1889
02:51:39,404 --> 02:51:44,487
Oskar, there are 1,100 people who are
alive because of you. Look at them.

1890
02:51:44,522 --> 02:51:47,173
If I'd made more money.

1891
02:51:50,626 --> 02:51:55,708
I threw away so much money.

1892
02:51:55,805 --> 02:51:59,161
You have no idea.

1893
02:51:59,258 --> 02:52:01,271
If I had just-

1894
02:52:01,367 --> 02:52:05,587
There will be generations
because of what you did.

1895
02:52:05,684 --> 02:52:08,560
I didn't do enough.

1896
02:52:08,657 --> 02:52:11,917
You did so much.

1897
02:52:14,986 --> 02:52:17,096
This car.

1898
02:52:17,192 --> 02:52:19,362
Goeth would've
bought this car.

1899
02:52:19,397 --> 02:52:23,330
Why did I keep the car?
Ten people right there.

1900
02:52:26,495 --> 02:52:28,954
Ten people.

1901
02:52:28,989 --> 02:52:31,003
Ten more people.

1902
02:52:33,976 --> 02:52:36,901
This pin.

1903
02:52:36,936 --> 02:52:39,826
Two people.

1904
02:52:39,921 --> 02:52:41,887
This is gold.

1905
02:52:41,922 --> 02:52:43,818
Two more people.

1906
02:52:43,853 --> 02:52:46,539
He would have given me
two for it; at least one.

1907
02:52:46,636 --> 02:52:49,896
He would have given me one,
one more.

1908
02:52:52,198 --> 02:52:55,794
One more person.

1909
02:52:55,829 --> 02:52:59,391
A person, Stern.

1910
02:52:59,426 --> 02:53:02,077
For this.

1911
02:53:03,899 --> 02:53:07,639
I could have gotten...

1912
02:53:07,734 --> 02:53:12,146
one more person
and I didn't.

1913
02:53:12,242 --> 02:53:16,078
And I-I didn't!

1914
02:54:40,381 --> 02:54:43,354
You have been liberated...

1915
02:54:43,449 --> 02:54:46,902
by the Soviet Army!

1916
02:54:53,520 --> 02:54:55,534
Have you been
in Poland?

1917
02:54:55,629 --> 02:54:58,842
I just came from Poland.

1918
02:54:58,877 --> 02:55:02,055
Are there
anyJews left?

1919
02:55:07,330 --> 02:55:09,727
Where should we go?

1920
02:55:09,824 --> 02:55:12,029
Don't go east, that's for sure.

1921
02:55:12,126 --> 02:55:15,194
They hate you there.

1922
02:55:15,291 --> 02:55:18,839
I wouldn't go west either,
if I were you.

1923
02:55:18,934 --> 02:55:22,866
We could use some food.

1924
02:55:22,963 --> 02:55:27,951
Isn't that a town
over there?

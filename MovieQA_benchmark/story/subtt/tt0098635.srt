1
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:18,221
I was sitting with my friend
Arthur Kornblum in a restaurant.

2
00:02:18,346 --> 00:02:21,558
It was a Horn & Hardart cafeteria.

3
00:02:21,683 --> 00:02:26,228
And this beautiful girl walked in,
and I turned to Arthur

4
00:02:26,355 --> 00:02:31,442
and I said "Arthur, you see that girl?
I'm going to marry her."

5
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:34,195
And two weeks later we were married.

6
00:02:34,321 --> 00:02:37,656
And it's over 50 years later,

7
00:02:37,783 --> 00:02:40,035
and we're still married.

8
00:02:46,792 --> 00:02:48,710
It's very clear

9
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:50,672
UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO - 1977

10
00:02:50,797 --> 00:02:54,091
Our love is here to stay

11
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:56,468
- I love you.
- I love you.

12
00:02:56,593 --> 00:03:00,472
Not for a year

13
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:04,560
But ever and a day

14
00:03:05,853 --> 00:03:11,609
Oh, the radio and the telephone

15
00:03:11,734 --> 00:03:15,278
And the movies that we know

16
00:03:15,404 --> 00:03:19,241
May just be passing fancies...

17
00:03:31,004 --> 00:03:34,090
Hi, Sally. Sally, this is Harry Burns.

18
00:03:34,215 --> 00:03:37,594
- Harry, this is Sally Albright.
- Nice to meet you.

19
00:03:37,719 --> 00:03:41,180
- Wanna drive the first shift?
- You're there already. You start.

20
00:03:41,305 --> 00:03:43,558
Back's open.

21
00:03:44,476 --> 00:03:47,145
- Call me.
- I'll call you as soon as I get there.

22
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:51,358
- Call me from the road.
- I'll call you before that.

23
00:03:51,483 --> 00:03:54,610
- I love you.
- I love you.

24
00:03:58,949 --> 00:04:00,908
Sorry.

25
00:04:01,034 --> 00:04:03,828
- I miss you already. I miss you already.
- I miss you.

26
00:04:03,954 --> 00:04:05,164
- Bye.
- Bye.

27
00:04:05,289 --> 00:04:09,042
In time, the Rockies may crumble

28
00:04:09,168 --> 00:04:11,920
Gibraltar may tumble

29
00:04:12,046 --> 00:04:14,173
They only made of clay

30
00:04:14,547 --> 00:04:16,592
But

31
00:04:16,718 --> 00:04:22,014
Our love is here to stay

32
00:04:23,139 --> 00:04:28,146
I have it all figured out. It's an 18-hour trip,
which becomes six shifts of three hours.

33
00:04:28,271 --> 00:04:31,940
Or, alternatively,
we could break it down by mileage.

34
00:04:32,067 --> 00:04:35,778
There's a... There's a map on the visor

35
00:04:35,903 --> 00:04:39,824
that I've marked to show the locations
where we can change shifts.

36
00:04:39,949 --> 00:04:41,826
Grape?

37
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:44,454
No. I don't like to eat between meals.

38
00:04:48,833 --> 00:04:51,336
I'll roll down the window.

39
00:04:59,219 --> 00:05:01,971
Why don't you tell me
the story of your life?

40
00:05:03,973 --> 00:05:08,185
- The story of my life?
- We got 18 hours to kill before New York.

41
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:12,190
That won't even get us out of Chicago.
Nothing's happened to me yet.

42
00:05:12,316 --> 00:05:14,860
- So I'm going to New York.
- So something'll happen?

43
00:05:14,985 --> 00:05:16,403
- Yes.
- Like what?

44
00:05:16,527 --> 00:05:19,030
Like I'm going to journalism school.

45
00:05:19,155 --> 00:05:23,076
So you can write about things
that happen to other people.

46
00:05:23,201 --> 00:05:26,163
- That's one way to look at it.
- Suppose nothing happens.

47
00:05:26,288 --> 00:05:30,042
Suppose you never meet anybody,
you never become anything,

48
00:05:30,166 --> 00:05:35,798
then you die and nobody notices for two
weeks until the smell drifts into the hall.

49
00:05:38,342 --> 00:05:41,512
- Amanda said you had a dark side.
- That's what drew her to me.

50
00:05:41,637 --> 00:05:44,975
- Your dark side?
- Sure. Why, don't you have a dark side?

51
00:05:45,141 --> 00:05:48,812
I know, you probably
dot your "i"s with little hearts.

52
00:05:48,936 --> 00:05:51,605
I have just as much of a
dark side as the next person.

53
00:05:51,731 --> 00:05:55,276
Oh, really? When I buy a new book,
I always read the last page first.

54
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:58,196
That way, if I die before I finish
I know how it ends.

55
00:05:58,321 --> 00:06:00,740
That, my friend, is a dark side.

56
00:06:00,865 --> 00:06:05,454
That doesn't mean you're deep.
I mean, yes, basically I'm a happy person.

57
00:06:05,578 --> 00:06:08,164
- So am I.
- I don't see anything wrong with that.

58
00:06:08,289 --> 00:06:11,501
No, you're too busy being happy.
Ever think about death?

59
00:06:11,626 --> 00:06:13,837
- Yes.
- Sure you do. A fleeting thought

60
00:06:13,962 --> 00:06:17,381
that drifts in and out of the transom
of your mind. I spend days.

61
00:06:17,506 --> 00:06:19,551
And this makes you a better person?

62
00:06:19,676 --> 00:06:23,471
Look, when the shit comes down,
I'm gonna be prepared and you're not.

63
00:06:23,596 --> 00:06:27,851
In the meantime, you're gonna
ruin your whole life waiting for it.

64
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:38,195
- You're wrong.
- I'm not wrong. He wants her to leave.

65
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:41,491
- That's why he puts her on the plane.
- She doesn't want to stay!

66
00:06:41,616 --> 00:06:45,869
Of course she wants to stay! Wouldn't you
rather be with Bogart than the other guy?

67
00:06:45,994 --> 00:06:51,166
I don't wanna spend my life in Casablanca
married to a man who runs a bar.

68
00:06:51,292 --> 00:06:53,752
That probably sounds snobbish
to you, but I don't.

69
00:06:53,877 --> 00:06:57,298
- You'd rather be in a loveless marriage...
- And First Lady of Czechoslovakia.

70
00:06:57,423 --> 00:07:00,467
..than with the man you had
the greatest sex of your life with,

71
00:07:00,592 --> 00:07:03,346
just because he owns a bar
and that is all he does?

72
00:07:03,471 --> 00:07:04,889
Yes.

73
00:07:05,014 --> 00:07:08,475
And so would any woman in
her right mind. Women are practical,

74
00:07:08,601 --> 00:07:13,607
even Ingrid Bergman, which is why she
gets on the plane at the end of the movie.

75
00:07:16,441 --> 00:07:18,612
I understand.

76
00:07:18,736 --> 00:07:21,198
- What? What?
- Nothing.

77
00:07:21,739 --> 00:07:23,699
- What?
- Forget about it.

78
00:07:23,825 --> 00:07:26,286
- Forget about what?
- It's not important.

79
00:07:26,412 --> 00:07:28,455
No, just tell me.

80
00:07:29,081 --> 00:07:31,916
Obviously you haven't had great sex yet.

81
00:07:32,041 --> 00:07:34,293
- Two, please.
- Right over there.

82
00:07:34,419 --> 00:07:36,548
- Yes, I have.
- No, you haven't.

83
00:07:36,672 --> 00:07:40,383
It just so happens that
I have had plenty of good sex.

84
00:07:58,528 --> 00:08:01,030
With whom?

85
00:08:01,155 --> 00:08:04,825
- What?
- With whom did you have this great sex?

86
00:08:05,034 --> 00:08:07,077
I'm not gonna tell you that!

87
00:08:07,369 --> 00:08:10,123
Fine. Don't tell me.

88
00:08:14,543 --> 00:08:18,339
- Shel Gordon.
- Shel. Sheldon?

89
00:08:18,464 --> 00:08:21,801
No. No, you did not have
great sex with Sheldon.

90
00:08:21,926 --> 00:08:24,637
- I did, too.
- No, you didn't.

91
00:08:24,763 --> 00:08:29,225
A Sheldon can do your taxes. If you
need a root canal, Sheldon's your man.

92
00:08:29,351 --> 00:08:32,520
But humpin' is not Sheldon's strong suit.
It's the name.

93
00:08:32,645 --> 00:08:37,317
"Do it to me, Sheldon." "You're an animal,
Sheldon." "Ride me, big Sheldon."

94
00:08:37,691 --> 00:08:40,444
- It doesn't work.
- Hi.

95
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:43,032
- What can I get you?
- I'll have a number three.

96
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:48,370
The chef's salad with the oil and vinegar
on the side. And the apple pie á la mode.

97
00:08:48,495 --> 00:08:51,790
Chef and apple á la mode.

98
00:08:51,915 --> 00:08:55,586
But I'd like the pie heated
and I want the ice cream on the side.

99
00:08:55,710 --> 00:09:00,422
I'd like strawberry, if you have it. If not,
then whipped cream, but only if it's real.

100
00:09:00,548 --> 00:09:02,258
If it's out of a can, nothing.

101
00:09:02,384 --> 00:09:06,305
- Not even the pie?
- No, just the pie, but then not heated.

102
00:09:12,894 --> 00:09:15,689
- What?
- Nothin'. Nothin'.

103
00:09:17,983 --> 00:09:21,279
- How come you broke up with Sheldon?
- How do you know we broke up?

104
00:09:21,404 --> 00:09:26,700
If you didn't, you wouldn't be with me.
You'd be with Shel the Wonder Schlong.

105
00:09:26,825 --> 00:09:30,204
First of all, I am not with you.

106
00:09:30,329 --> 00:09:33,916
And second of all, it is none
of your business why we broke up.

107
00:09:34,041 --> 00:09:37,586
You're right, you're right.
I don't wanna know.

108
00:09:40,172 --> 00:09:44,845
Well, it was because he was jealous and
I had these days-of-the-week underpants.

109
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:48,180
Sorry, I need a judge's ruling on this.

110
00:09:48,305 --> 00:09:50,851
- Days-of-the-week underpants?
- Yes.

111
00:09:50,977 --> 00:09:54,271
They had days of the week on them
and I thought they were funny.

112
00:09:54,395 --> 00:09:58,025
Then one day Sheldon says to me
"You never wear Sunday."

113
00:09:58,150 --> 00:10:01,194
He's all suspicious.
Where had I left Sunday?

114
00:10:01,319 --> 00:10:03,488
And I told him and he didn't believe me.

115
00:10:03,947 --> 00:10:06,867
- What?
- They don't make Sunday.

116
00:10:06,992 --> 00:10:10,370
- Why not?
- Because of God.

117
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:18,919
OK, so 15 % of my share is 90.

118
00:10:19,629 --> 00:10:21,882
$6.90.

119
00:10:24,593 --> 00:10:27,013
Let's leave seven.

120
00:10:29,806 --> 00:10:31,892
What?

121
00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:35,396
Do I have something on my face?

122
00:10:36,564 --> 00:10:38,690
You're a very attractive person.

123
00:10:40,859 --> 00:10:42,070
Thank you.

124
00:10:42,195 --> 00:10:44,405
Amanda never said
how attractive you were.

125
00:10:44,530 --> 00:10:47,200
Maybe she doesn't think I'm attractive.

126
00:10:47,324 --> 00:10:52,081
I don't think it's a matter of opinion.
Empirically, you are attractive.

127
00:10:53,373 --> 00:10:55,499
Amanda is my friend.

128
00:10:55,624 --> 00:10:57,085
So?

129
00:10:57,210 --> 00:11:00,047
- So you're going with her.
- So?

130
00:11:00,171 --> 00:11:02,340
So you're coming on to me!

131
00:11:02,924 --> 00:11:05,426
No, I wasn't.

132
00:11:05,927 --> 00:11:07,638
What?

133
00:11:08,138 --> 00:11:12,059
Can't a man say a woman is attractive
without it being a come-on?

134
00:11:12,184 --> 00:11:13,602
All right, all right.

135
00:11:13,726 --> 00:11:18,398
Let's just say, just for the sake
of argument, that it was a come-on.

136
00:11:18,523 --> 00:11:22,528
What d'you want me to do about it?
I take it back, OK? I take it back.

137
00:11:22,652 --> 00:11:24,112
You can't take it back.

138
00:11:24,237 --> 00:11:26,906
- Why not?
- Because it's already out there.

139
00:11:27,031 --> 00:11:30,493
What are we supposed to do?
Call the cops, it's already out there!

140
00:11:30,785 --> 00:11:33,663
Just let it lie.

141
00:11:33,789 --> 00:11:38,543
- OK?
- Great! "Let it lie." That's my policy.

142
00:11:38,668 --> 00:11:41,756
That's what I always say: "Let it lie."

143
00:11:41,881 --> 00:11:43,633
Wanna spend the night in a motel?

144
00:11:43,758 --> 00:11:45,801
- See? I didn't let it lie.
- Harry.

145
00:11:45,926 --> 00:11:47,970
I said I would, then I didn't.

146
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:49,722
- Harry!
- What?

147
00:11:49,847 --> 00:11:52,267
We are just going to be friends, OK?

148
00:11:52,392 --> 00:11:55,019
Great! Friends! It's the best thing.

149
00:11:56,479 --> 00:11:59,274
You realise
that we could never be friends.

150
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:02,151
- Why not?
- What I'm saying is,

151
00:12:02,316 --> 00:12:05,238
and this is not a come-on
in any way, shape or form,

152
00:12:05,363 --> 00:12:10,285
is that men and women can't be friends,
cos the sex part always gets in the way.

153
00:12:11,785 --> 00:12:16,123
That's not true. I have a number of
men friends and there is no sex involved.

154
00:12:16,248 --> 00:12:17,375
- You don't.
- I do.

155
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:18,709
- You don't.
- I do!

156
00:12:18,834 --> 00:12:20,086
You only think you do.

157
00:12:20,211 --> 00:12:22,464
I have sex with them
without my knowledge?

158
00:12:22,589 --> 00:12:25,926
No, they all wanna have sex with you.

159
00:12:26,052 --> 00:12:27,636
- They do not.
- Do, too.

160
00:12:27,844 --> 00:12:29,763
- They do not.
- Do, too.

161
00:12:29,888 --> 00:12:30,888
How do you know?

162
00:12:31,013 --> 00:12:34,142
No man can be friends
with a woman he finds attractive.

163
00:12:34,267 --> 00:12:36,979
He always wants to have sex with her.

164
00:12:37,104 --> 00:12:41,232
So you're saying a man can be friends
with a woman he finds unattractive.

165
00:12:41,525 --> 00:12:44,403
No, you pretty much
wanna nail them, too.

166
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:48,157
What if they don't wanna have sex?

167
00:12:48,282 --> 00:12:53,787
Doesn't matter. The sex thing is already
out there, so the friendship is doomed.

168
00:12:54,704 --> 00:12:57,458
- I guess we're not gonna be friends then.
- Guess not.

169
00:12:57,582 --> 00:12:59,543
That's too bad.

170
00:12:59,669 --> 00:13:02,587
You were the only person
that I knew in New York.

171
00:13:02,712 --> 00:13:06,341
You say ee-ther, I say either

172
00:13:06,467 --> 00:13:10,262
You say nee-ther and I say neither

173
00:13:10,389 --> 00:13:12,139
Ee-ther, either

174
00:13:12,265 --> 00:13:14,142
And nee-ther, neither

175
00:13:14,267 --> 00:13:17,478
Let's call the whole thing off

176
00:13:17,603 --> 00:13:22,067
Yes, you like potato and I like pot-ahto

177
00:13:22,192 --> 00:13:25,986
You like tomato, I like tom-ahto

178
00:13:26,112 --> 00:13:27,988
Potato, pot-ahto

179
00:13:28,114 --> 00:13:30,116
Tomato, tom-ahto

180
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:33,285
Let's call the whole thing off

181
00:13:41,335 --> 00:13:45,172
- Thanks for the ride.
- Yeah. It was interesting.

182
00:13:45,297 --> 00:13:48,385
- It was nice knowing you.
- Yeah.

183
00:13:57,394 --> 00:14:01,230
- Well, have a nice life.
- You, too.

184
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:05,068
You like potato and I like pot-ahto

185
00:14:05,193 --> 00:14:09,156
You like tomato, I like tom-ahto

186
00:14:09,281 --> 00:14:11,116
Potato, pot-ahto

187
00:14:11,241 --> 00:14:13,285
Tomato, tom-ahto

188
00:14:13,410 --> 00:14:16,413
Let's call the whole thing off

189
00:14:18,915 --> 00:14:22,919
- We fell in love in high school.
- Yeah, we were high-school sweethearts.

190
00:14:23,045 --> 00:14:26,298
But then after our junior year
his parents moved away.

191
00:14:26,423 --> 00:14:30,553
- But I never forgot her.
- He never forgot me.

192
00:14:30,677 --> 00:14:34,057
No, her face was burned on my brain.

193
00:14:34,182 --> 00:14:37,809
And it was 34 years later
that I was walking down Broadway

194
00:14:37,934 --> 00:14:40,063
and I saw her come out of Toffenetti's.

195
00:14:40,188 --> 00:14:42,066
We both looked at each other,

196
00:14:42,191 --> 00:14:46,568
and it was just as though
not a single day had gone by.

197
00:14:46,693 --> 00:14:50,699
She was just as beautiful
as she was at sixteen.

198
00:14:50,824 --> 00:14:53,076
He was just the same.

199
00:14:53,201 --> 00:14:55,453
He looked exactly the same.

200
00:15:00,374 --> 00:15:03,629
FIVE YEARS LATER

201
00:15:28,028 --> 00:15:30,823
Joe! I thought it was you.
I thought it was you.

202
00:15:30,948 --> 00:15:32,991
- Harry Burns.
- Harry. How ya doin'?

203
00:15:33,117 --> 00:15:36,162
- Good. How you doin'?
- Fine. I'm doin' fine.

204
00:15:36,287 --> 00:15:38,664
I was just walking by
and I thought it was you.

205
00:15:38,789 --> 00:15:40,374
Yeah, it was.

206
00:15:40,499 --> 00:15:44,587
- You still with the DA's office?
- No, I switched to the other side. You?

207
00:15:44,712 --> 00:15:49,133
I work with a small firm. We do
political consulting. Yeah, it's great.

208
00:15:50,635 --> 00:15:53,929
Harry, this is Sally Albright. Harry Burns.

209
00:15:54,178 --> 00:15:57,142
Harry and I, we used to...
We lived in the same building.

210
00:16:00,687 --> 00:16:04,773
Well, listen, I got a plane to catch.
It was good to see you, Joe. Bye.

211
00:16:11,573 --> 00:16:15,409
Thank God he couldn't place me. I drove
to New York with him five years ago

212
00:16:15,534 --> 00:16:18,537
and it was the longest night of my life.

213
00:16:20,082 --> 00:16:23,000
- What happened?
- He made a pass at me. When I said no:

214
00:16:23,126 --> 00:16:26,212
he was going with a girlfriend of mine...

215
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:30,216
Oh, God. I can't remember her name.

216
00:16:30,341 --> 00:16:34,304
Don't get involved with me. I am 26
and can't remember the name of the girl

217
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:38,308
I was such good friends with
I wouldn't get involved with her boyfriend.

218
00:16:38,433 --> 00:16:40,477
- So what happened?
- When?

219
00:16:40,602 --> 00:16:43,814
When he made a pass, you said no...

220
00:16:43,939 --> 00:16:46,567
I said we could just be friends.

221
00:16:46,692 --> 00:16:52,113
And this part I remember. He said men
and women could never really be friends.

222
00:16:52,239 --> 00:16:54,450
Do you think that's true?

223
00:16:55,326 --> 00:16:56,535
No.

224
00:16:56,786 --> 00:16:59,455
Do you have any women friends,
just friends?

225
00:17:00,246 --> 00:17:01,664
No.

226
00:17:01,873 --> 00:17:04,836
But I will get one if it's important to you.

227
00:17:06,754 --> 00:17:08,798
Amanda Reese!

228
00:17:08,922 --> 00:17:11,217
That was her name. Thank God.

229
00:17:11,342 --> 00:17:14,971
I will miss you. I love you.

230
00:17:15,513 --> 00:17:19,017
- You do?
- Yes.

231
00:17:20,268 --> 00:17:22,312
I love you.

232
00:17:45,836 --> 00:17:48,380
- What would you like to drink?
- Nothing, thanks.

233
00:17:48,504 --> 00:17:50,507
- D'you have any Bloody Mary mix?
- Yes.

234
00:17:50,632 --> 00:17:55,679
No, wait. Here's what I want. Regular
tomato juice, fill it up three quarters,

235
00:17:55,804 --> 00:18:00,559
then add a splash of Bloody Mary mix -
just a splash - and some lime on the side.

236
00:18:00,684 --> 00:18:02,936
The University of Chicago, right?

237
00:18:04,188 --> 00:18:07,732
- Yes.
- Did you look this good at university?

238
00:18:07,857 --> 00:18:10,277
- No.
- Did we ever...?

239
00:18:10,402 --> 00:18:12,447
No. No!

240
00:18:13,239 --> 00:18:17,284
We drove from Chicago to New York
together after graduation.

241
00:18:17,410 --> 00:18:20,997
- Would you two like to sit together?
- Great! Thank you.

242
00:18:27,003 --> 00:18:29,464
You were a good friend of...

243
00:18:30,255 --> 00:18:33,719
Amanda's. I can't believe
you can't remember her name.

244
00:18:33,843 --> 00:18:36,346
What do you mean?
I can remember. Amanda Rice.

245
00:18:36,472 --> 00:18:39,139
- Reese.
- Reese, right. What happened to her?

246
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:41,976
- I have no idea.
- You have no idea?!

247
00:18:42,101 --> 00:18:45,773
You were friends. We didn't make it
because you were such good friends.

248
00:18:45,897 --> 00:18:47,775
- You went with her!
- Was it worth it?

249
00:18:47,899 --> 00:18:50,402
The sacrifice, for a friend
you no longer see?

250
00:18:50,527 --> 00:18:52,820
Harry, you might not believe this,

251
00:18:52,945 --> 00:18:56,867
but I never considered
not sleeping with you a sacrifice.

252
00:18:57,117 --> 00:18:59,953
Fair enough. Fair enough.

253
00:19:03,165 --> 00:19:05,334
- You wanted to be a gymnast.
- Journalist.

254
00:19:05,459 --> 00:19:09,171
- That's what I said. And?
- I am a journalist. I work at The News.

255
00:19:09,296 --> 00:19:11,632
Great. And you're with Joe.

256
00:19:11,757 --> 00:19:14,510
Well, that's great. Great.

257
00:19:14,635 --> 00:19:17,513
You're together, what, three weeks?

258
00:19:18,223 --> 00:19:21,559
- A month. How did you know?
- You take someone to the airport,

259
00:19:21,685 --> 00:19:27,439
it's the beginning of a relationship. That
is why I never do that at the beginning.

260
00:19:27,649 --> 00:19:30,275
- Why?
- Because eventually things move on

261
00:19:30,402 --> 00:19:33,654
and you don't take someone.
I never wanted anyone to say

262
00:19:33,779 --> 00:19:37,325
"How come you never take me
to the airport any more?"

263
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:42,414
It's amazing. You look normal,
but actually you are the Angel of Death.

264
00:19:42,539 --> 00:19:44,708
Are you gonna marry him?

265
00:19:45,708 --> 00:19:50,546
We have known each other a month and
neither of us wants to marry right now.

266
00:19:50,672 --> 00:19:52,425
I'm getting married.

267
00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:54,718
You are?

268
00:19:54,843 --> 00:19:57,095
- You are?
- Yeah.

269
00:19:57,804 --> 00:20:01,974
- Who is she?
- Helen Hillson. She's keeping her name.

270
00:20:03,269 --> 00:20:05,730
- You're getting married.
- Yeah.

271
00:20:06,814 --> 00:20:09,691
What's so funny about that?

272
00:20:11,151 --> 00:20:14,155
It's just... It's just
so optimistic of you, Harry.

273
00:20:14,281 --> 00:20:17,198
You'd be amazed what
falling madly in love can do for you.

274
00:20:17,324 --> 00:20:20,745
Well, it's wonderful.
It's nice to see you embracing life.

275
00:20:20,869 --> 00:20:24,957
Yeah. Plus, you get to a certain point
where you get tired of the whole thing.

276
00:20:25,082 --> 00:20:28,544
- What whole thing?
- The whole "life of a single guy" thing.

277
00:20:28,669 --> 00:20:32,923
You meet someone, you have the safe
lunch, you decide to move on to dinner.

278
00:20:33,048 --> 00:20:36,343
You go dancing,
you do the white man's overbite,

279
00:20:36,927 --> 00:20:41,015
go back to her place, have sex, and then
you know what goes through your mind?

280
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:44,727
"How long do I have to lie here
and hold her before I can go home?"

281
00:20:44,852 --> 00:20:46,896
"Is 30 seconds enough?"

282
00:20:47,021 --> 00:20:49,858
That's what you're thinking? Is that true?

283
00:20:49,982 --> 00:20:52,361
Sure. All men think that.

284
00:20:52,526 --> 00:20:55,738
How long do you like to be
held afterwards? All night, right?

285
00:20:56,072 --> 00:21:00,327
That's the problem. Somewhere between
30 seconds and all night is your problem.

286
00:21:00,451 --> 00:21:02,913
- I don't have a problem.
- Yeah, you do.

287
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:20,473
- Staying over?
- Yes.

288
00:21:20,639 --> 00:21:24,226
Would you like to have dinner?
Just friends.

289
00:21:24,392 --> 00:21:26,770
You don't believe
men and women can be friends.

290
00:21:26,937 --> 00:21:29,231
- When did I say that?
- On the ride to New York.

291
00:21:29,356 --> 00:21:31,566
No, no, no, no, I never said that.

292
00:21:32,234 --> 00:21:35,987
Yes, that's right. They can't be friends.

293
00:21:36,154 --> 00:21:40,701
Unless both are involved with someone.
Then they can. I amend the earlier rule.

294
00:21:40,867 --> 00:21:46,206
If two people are in relationships, the
pressure of possible involvement is lifted.

295
00:21:46,331 --> 00:21:49,584
That doesn't work either.
The person you're with can't see

296
00:21:49,711 --> 00:21:52,171
why you need to be friends
with the person,

297
00:21:52,296 --> 00:21:55,800
like it means something
is missing from the relationship.

298
00:21:55,925 --> 00:21:59,679
Then when you say "No, nothing
is missing", the person you're with

299
00:21:59,846 --> 00:22:03,766
accuses you of being attracted
to the person you're just friends with,

300
00:22:03,932 --> 00:22:06,686
which you probably are.
I mean, let's face it.

301
00:22:06,812 --> 00:22:09,188
So we're back to the rule
before the amendment:

302
00:22:09,355 --> 00:22:12,108
men and women can't be friends.
Where's it leave us?

303
00:22:12,233 --> 00:22:13,651
- Harry.
- What?

304
00:22:13,776 --> 00:22:15,736
Goodbye.

305
00:22:15,903 --> 00:22:17,697
OK.

306
00:22:24,537 --> 00:22:27,458
I'll just stop walking. I'll let you go ahead.

307
00:22:31,502 --> 00:22:33,629
We were married 40 years ago.

308
00:22:33,755 --> 00:22:37,425
We were married three years,
we got a divorce. Then I married Marjorie.

309
00:22:37,593 --> 00:22:40,136
- First you lived with Barbara.
- Right, Barbara.

310
00:22:40,262 --> 00:22:42,806
But I didn't marry Barbara.
I married Marjorie.

311
00:22:42,931 --> 00:22:46,100
- Then you got a divorce.
- Right. Then I married Katie.

312
00:22:46,267 --> 00:22:47,894
Another divorce.

313
00:22:48,019 --> 00:22:52,983
Then a couple of years later at
Eddie Collecio's funeral, I ran into her.

314
00:22:53,108 --> 00:22:55,819
I was with some girl
I don't even remember.

315
00:22:55,944 --> 00:22:58,697
- Roberta.
- Right. Roberta.

316
00:22:58,822 --> 00:23:01,200
But I couldn't take my eyes off you.

317
00:23:01,367 --> 00:23:04,620
I remember I snuck over to her
and I said...

318
00:23:04,787 --> 00:23:07,873
- What did I say?
- You said "What are you doin' after?"

319
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:12,587
Right. So I ditch Roberta, we go
for coffee, a month later we're married.

320
00:23:12,754 --> 00:23:15,839
35 years to the day
after our first marriage.

321
00:23:19,385 --> 00:23:21,096
- I went through his pockets.
- Marie, why?

322
00:23:21,221 --> 00:23:22,389
FIVE YEARS LATER

323
00:23:22,554 --> 00:23:25,100
- You know what I found?
- No, what?

324
00:23:25,225 --> 00:23:29,354
They just bought a dining-room table.
His wife just spent $1 ,600 on a table.

325
00:23:29,521 --> 00:23:32,356
- Where?
- The point isn't where, Alice.

326
00:23:32,481 --> 00:23:34,609
The point is he's never gonna leave her.

327
00:23:34,734 --> 00:23:37,279
What else is new?
You've known this for two years.

328
00:23:37,529 --> 00:23:39,906
You're right. I know you're right.

329
00:23:40,031 --> 00:23:44,160
Can't you find someone single? When I
was single I knew lots of nice single men.

330
00:23:44,285 --> 00:23:46,955
There must be someone.
Sally found someone.

331
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:49,374
Sally got the last good one.

332
00:23:49,499 --> 00:23:51,377
- Joe and I broke up.
- What?

333
00:23:51,502 --> 00:23:53,044
- When?
- Monday.

334
00:23:53,211 --> 00:23:55,422
- You waited three days?
- Joe's available?

335
00:23:55,547 --> 00:23:59,760
For God's sake, Marie, don't you
have feelings? She's obviously upset.

336
00:23:59,885 --> 00:24:02,887
I'm not that upset.
We'd been growing apart for a while.

337
00:24:03,012 --> 00:24:04,472
But you were a couple.

338
00:24:04,597 --> 00:24:08,351
You had someone to go places with.
You had a date on national holidays!

339
00:24:08,561 --> 00:24:12,148
I said to myself "You deserve
more than this. You're 31 ..."

340
00:24:12,273 --> 00:24:16,651
- And the clock is ticking.
- No, it doesn't start to tick until you're 36.

341
00:24:16,776 --> 00:24:19,031
God, you're in such great shape.

342
00:24:19,196 --> 00:24:23,325
Well, I've had a few days
to get used to it, and I feel OK.

343
00:24:23,492 --> 00:24:25,702
Good. Then you're ready.

344
00:24:27,204 --> 00:24:30,374
- Really, Marie!
- Well, how else do you think you do it?

345
00:24:30,499 --> 00:24:34,170
I've got the perfect guy.
I don't find him attractive, but you might.

346
00:24:34,336 --> 00:24:36,381
She doesn't have a problem with chins.

347
00:24:36,548 --> 00:24:40,259
- Marie, I'm not ready yet.
- But you just said you were over him.

348
00:24:40,426 --> 00:24:43,847
I am over him,
but I'm in a mourning period.

349
00:24:46,557 --> 00:24:48,852
- Who is it?
- Alex Anderson.

350
00:24:50,353 --> 00:24:52,813
You fixed me up with him six years ago.

351
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:55,442
Sorry. God.

352
00:24:55,609 --> 00:24:58,070
All right, wait. Here. Here we go.

353
00:24:58,236 --> 00:25:01,781
- Ken Darman.
- He's been married for over a year.

354
00:25:01,989 --> 00:25:04,159
Really?

355
00:25:04,326 --> 00:25:06,328
Married.

356
00:25:06,578 --> 00:25:08,579
- Wait. Wait, I got one.
- Look,

357
00:25:08,746 --> 00:25:13,209
there is no point going out with someone
I might like if I met him at the right time,

358
00:25:13,377 --> 00:25:17,047
but who right now would
just be a transitional man.

359
00:25:17,214 --> 00:25:21,844
OK, but don't wait too long. Remember
what happened with David Warsaw?

360
00:25:21,968 --> 00:25:26,681
His wife left him and everyone said "Give
him some time. Don't move in too fast."

361
00:25:26,891 --> 00:25:29,268
Six months later he was dead.

362
00:25:29,519 --> 00:25:33,105
Are you saying I should marry quickly
in case he's about to die?

363
00:25:33,271 --> 00:25:35,691
At least you could say you were married.

364
00:25:35,857 --> 00:25:41,196
I'm saying that the right man is out there.
If you don't grab him, someone else will,

365
00:25:41,364 --> 00:25:47,035
and you'll spend your life knowing that
someone else is married to your husband.

366
00:25:50,289 --> 00:25:52,500
Ten! Hut!

367
00:26:06,973 --> 00:26:10,893
- When did this happen?
- Friday. Helen comes home from work

368
00:26:11,061 --> 00:26:14,480
and she says "I don't know
if I wanna be married any more."

369
00:26:14,648 --> 00:26:20,153
Like it's the institution. Nothing personal,
just something she's been thinking about.

370
00:26:20,278 --> 00:26:24,867
I'm calm. I say "Why don't we take time to
think about it? Don't rush into anything."

371
00:26:25,034 --> 00:26:28,162
- Yeah, right.
- Next day she says she's thought about it.

372
00:26:28,328 --> 00:26:31,706
She wants a trial separation.
She just wants to try it.

373
00:26:31,873 --> 00:26:35,170
But we can still date -
like this is supposed to cushion the blow.

374
00:26:35,335 --> 00:26:39,465
I got married so I could stop dating,
so still dating is not a big incentive

375
00:26:39,631 --> 00:26:43,261
since the last thing you wanna do
is date your wife, who should love you.

376
00:26:43,428 --> 00:26:47,056
Which is what I'm saying to her,
when it occurs to me maybe she doesn't.

377
00:26:47,222 --> 00:26:49,975
So I say to her
"Don't you love me any more?"

378
00:26:50,142 --> 00:26:53,561
D'you know what she says?
"I don't know if I've ever loved you."

379
00:26:53,728 --> 00:26:57,775
That's harsh. You don't
bounce back from that right away.

380
00:26:57,901 --> 00:27:00,861
- Thanks, Jess.
- No, I'm a writer. I know dialogue.

381
00:27:01,028 --> 00:27:02,613
That's particularly harsh.

382
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:06,034
Then she says someone in her office
is going to South America

383
00:27:06,201 --> 00:27:10,789
and she can sublet his apartment.
I can't believe this. And the doorbell rings.

384
00:27:10,954 --> 00:27:15,334
"I can sublet his apartment" - the words
still hang in the air like in a balloon...

385
00:27:15,501 --> 00:27:17,087
- Like a cartoon.
- Right.

386
00:27:17,253 --> 00:27:22,175
So I go to the door and there are moving
men there. Now I start to get suspicious.

387
00:27:22,343 --> 00:27:26,053
I say "Helen, when did you call
these movers?" She doesn't say anything.

388
00:27:26,221 --> 00:27:29,016
So I ask the movers
"When did this woman book you?"

389
00:27:29,183 --> 00:27:34,229
And they're three huge guys. One with
a T-shirt saying "Don't fuck with Mr Zero."

390
00:27:34,397 --> 00:27:39,902
So I said "Helen, when did you make this
arrangement?" She says "A week ago."

391
00:27:40,068 --> 00:27:43,239
I said "You've known for a week
and you didn't tell me?"

392
00:27:43,364 --> 00:27:46,741
And she says
"I didn't wanna ruin your birthday."

393
00:27:49,077 --> 00:27:52,207
Mr Zero knew you were getting
a divorce a week before you?

394
00:27:52,332 --> 00:27:54,290
- Mr Zero knew.
- I can't believe this!

395
00:27:54,416 --> 00:27:58,796
- I haven't told you the bad part yet.
- What's worse than Mr Zero knowing?

396
00:27:58,921 --> 00:28:00,964
It's all a lie.

397
00:28:01,549 --> 00:28:05,720
She's in love with somebody else.
Some tax attorney.

398
00:28:05,845 --> 00:28:09,849
- She moved in with him.
- How did you find out?

399
00:28:09,974 --> 00:28:12,268
I followed her. Stood outside the building.

400
00:28:12,393 --> 00:28:15,188
- That's so humiliating!
- Tell me about it.

401
00:28:15,395 --> 00:28:19,775
And, you know, I knew. I knew that even
though we were happy, it was an illusion.

402
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:22,403
And that one day
she'd kick the shit outta me.

403
00:28:22,528 --> 00:28:27,867
Marriages don't break up due to infidelity.
It's a symptom something else is wrong.

404
00:28:28,201 --> 00:28:31,162
Oh, really?
Well, that symptom is fucking my wife!

405
00:28:35,542 --> 00:28:38,878
So I just happened to see
his American Express bill.

406
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:42,132
What do you mean
"just happened" to see it?

407
00:28:42,506 --> 00:28:46,219
Well, he was shaving,
and there it was in his briefcase.

408
00:28:46,344 --> 00:28:48,972
What if he came out and saw you?

409
00:28:49,097 --> 00:28:51,975
You're missing the point.
I'm telling you what I found.

410
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:57,272
He just spent $1 20
on a new nightgown for his wife.

411
00:28:58,565 --> 00:29:03,236
- I don't think he's ever gonna leave her.
- No one thinks he's ever gonna leave her.

412
00:29:03,362 --> 00:29:06,865
You're right, you're right.
I know you're right.

413
00:29:21,631 --> 00:29:25,342
Someone is staring at you
in Personal Growth.

414
00:29:27,969 --> 00:29:31,474
I know him. You'd like him. He's married.

415
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:36,396
- Who is he?
- Harry Burns. He's a political consultant.

416
00:29:36,646 --> 00:29:38,230
He's cute.

417
00:29:38,356 --> 00:29:41,734
- You think he's cute?
- How do you know he's married?

418
00:29:41,859 --> 00:29:44,028
Last time I saw him
he was getting married.

419
00:29:44,154 --> 00:29:47,240
- When was that?
- Six years ago.

420
00:29:47,364 --> 00:29:50,326
So he might not be married any more.

421
00:29:50,451 --> 00:29:52,413
Also, he's obnoxious.

422
00:29:52,537 --> 00:29:56,791
It's like in The Lady Vanishes, when she
says "You're the most obnoxious man",...

423
00:29:56,916 --> 00:30:00,128
- "The most contemptible".
- ..then they fall madly in love.

424
00:30:00,252 --> 00:30:03,756
- Also, he never remembers me.
- Sally Albright.

425
00:30:05,634 --> 00:30:07,761
- Hi, Harry.
- I thought it was you.

426
00:30:07,886 --> 00:30:10,514
It is. This is Marie.

427
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:13,809
Was Marie.

428
00:30:13,934 --> 00:30:15,978
- How are you?
- Fine.

429
00:30:16,103 --> 00:30:18,939
- How's Joe?
- Fine.

430
00:30:19,063 --> 00:30:21,191
I hear he's fine.

431
00:30:21,316 --> 00:30:24,736
- You're not with Joe any more?
- We just broke up.

432
00:30:26,196 --> 00:30:28,408
I'm sorry. That's too bad.

433
00:30:29,284 --> 00:30:31,869
Yeah. Well, you know.

434
00:30:31,994 --> 00:30:33,411
Yeah.

435
00:30:33,537 --> 00:30:35,581
So...

436
00:30:35,706 --> 00:30:37,709
- What about you?
- I'm fine.

437
00:30:37,833 --> 00:30:39,877
How's married life?

438
00:30:41,003 --> 00:30:42,756
I'm getting a divorce.

439
00:30:44,215 --> 00:30:48,010
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

440
00:30:48,678 --> 00:30:51,514
Yeah, well, what're you gonna do?

441
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:53,265
What happened with you guys?

442
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:57,603
When Joe and I started seeing each other
we wanted the same thing.

443
00:30:57,729 --> 00:31:02,025
We didn't wanna get married because
every time anyone we knew got married

444
00:31:02,150 --> 00:31:06,237
it ruined their relationship.
They practically never had sex again.

445
00:31:06,363 --> 00:31:10,033
It's true. That's one of the secrets
that no one ever tells you.

446
00:31:10,158 --> 00:31:15,747
I would sit with my girlfriends who have
kids... my one girlfriend with kids, Alice,

447
00:31:15,871 --> 00:31:20,042
and she would complain about
how she and Gary never did it any more.

448
00:31:20,168 --> 00:31:23,588
She didn't even complain about it.
She said it matter-of-factly.

449
00:31:23,713 --> 00:31:27,217
She said they were up all night,
they were both exhausted,

450
00:31:27,342 --> 00:31:31,053
the kids took every sexual impulse
they had out of them.

451
00:31:32,638 --> 00:31:37,478
Joe and I would say "We're so lucky.
We have this wonderful relationship."

452
00:31:37,603 --> 00:31:41,857
"We can have sex on the kitchen floor
and not worry about the kids walking in."

453
00:31:41,981 --> 00:31:45,819
"We can fly off to Rome
on a moment's notice."

454
00:31:46,946 --> 00:31:50,156
Then one day I was taking
Alice's girl for the afternoon

455
00:31:50,282 --> 00:31:55,871
cos I promised to take her to the circus.
We were in the cab playing I-spy.

456
00:31:55,996 --> 00:31:58,667
"I spy a mailbox", "I spy a lamppost".

457
00:31:59,251 --> 00:32:02,919
And she looked out the window
and she saw this man and woman

458
00:32:03,044 --> 00:32:07,384
with these two little kids, and the man
had one of the kids on his shoulders.

459
00:32:07,509 --> 00:32:10,803
And she said "I spy a family."

460
00:32:12,179 --> 00:32:16,516
And I started to cry.
You know, I just started crying.

461
00:32:17,894 --> 00:32:20,647
And I went home
and I said "The thing is, Joe,

462
00:32:20,772 --> 00:32:23,900
we never do fly off to Rome
on a moment's notice."

463
00:32:24,191 --> 00:32:25,860
And the kitchen floor...?

464
00:32:26,486 --> 00:32:31,199
Not once. It's this very cold,
hard, Mexican ceramic tile.

465
00:32:33,452 --> 00:32:35,078
Anyway,

466
00:32:35,202 --> 00:32:40,625
we talked about it for a long time. I said
"This is what I want" and he said "I don't".

467
00:32:40,751 --> 00:32:44,046
And I said "Well, I guess it's over."
And he left.

468
00:32:46,964 --> 00:32:50,887
And the thing is, I... I feel really fine.

469
00:32:51,012 --> 00:32:54,264
I am over him.
I mean, I really am over him.

470
00:32:54,389 --> 00:32:57,602
That was it for him.
That was the most that he could give.

471
00:32:57,726 --> 00:33:02,815
And every time I think about it, I am more
and more convinced I did the right thing.

472
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:05,318
Boy, you sound really healthy.

473
00:33:05,443 --> 00:33:06,986
Yeah.

474
00:33:07,403 --> 00:33:10,781
- At least I got the apartment.
- That's what everybody says to me.

475
00:33:10,906 --> 00:33:15,786
But really, what's so hard about finding an
apartment? You read the obituary column.

476
00:33:15,911 --> 00:33:19,540
You find out who died, go to the building,
and then you tip the doorman.

477
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:23,794
It'd be easier if they combined
obituaries with the real-estate section.

478
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:27,174
Then you have "Mr Klein died,
leaving a wife, two children

479
00:33:27,299 --> 00:33:32,178
and a spacious three-bedroom
apartment with a wood-burning fireplace."

480
00:33:34,514 --> 00:33:37,559
The first time we met
I really didn't like you that much.

481
00:33:37,684 --> 00:33:39,519
- I didn't like you.
- Yeah, you did.

482
00:33:39,645 --> 00:33:43,064
You were just so uptight then.
You're much softer now.

483
00:33:43,189 --> 00:33:47,236
I hate that kind of remark. It sounds
like a compliment, but it's an insult.

484
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:49,488
OK, you're still as hard as nails.

485
00:33:49,613 --> 00:33:53,199
I didn't wanna sleep with you
so you wrote it off as a character flaw,

486
00:33:53,324 --> 00:33:58,748
instead of dealing with the possibility
it might have something to do with you.

487
00:33:58,873 --> 00:34:02,376
What's the statute of limitations
on apologies?

488
00:34:03,543 --> 00:34:07,172
- Ten years.
- I can just get it in under the wire.

489
00:34:11,928 --> 00:34:14,639
Would you like to have
dinner with me sometime?

490
00:34:15,098 --> 00:34:17,598
Are we becoming friends now?

491
00:34:19,058 --> 00:34:20,895
Well...

492
00:34:22,063 --> 00:34:23,355
Yeah.

493
00:34:24,982 --> 00:34:27,651
Great! A woman friend.

494
00:34:28,862 --> 00:34:33,908
You may be the first attractive woman I've
not wanted to sleep with in my entire life.

495
00:34:34,034 --> 00:34:36,369
That's wonderful, Harry.

496
00:34:37,745 --> 00:34:40,831
- We were born in the same hospital,...
- ln 1921 .

497
00:34:40,956 --> 00:34:43,502
- ..seven days apart.
- ln the same hospital.

498
00:34:43,627 --> 00:34:46,754
- We both grew up one block apart.
- We lived in tenements.

499
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:49,757
- On the Lower East Side.
- On Delancey Street.

500
00:34:49,883 --> 00:34:52,968
- I moved to the Bronx when I was ten.
- He lived on Fordham Road.

501
00:34:53,093 --> 00:34:56,056
- She moved when she was 1 1 .
- I lived on 183rd Street.

502
00:34:56,181 --> 00:35:01,436
- She worked on the 1 5th floor as a nurse.
- I worked for a prominent neurologist,...

503
00:35:01,561 --> 00:35:04,607
- I had a practice on the 14th floor.
- ..Dr Permelman.

504
00:35:04,732 --> 00:35:07,109
- We never met.
- Never met.

505
00:35:07,234 --> 00:35:10,904
- Can you imagine that?
- D'you know where we met? An elevator.

506
00:35:11,030 --> 00:35:13,908
- I was visiting family.
- ln the Ambassador Hotel.

507
00:35:14,033 --> 00:35:16,701
He was on the third floor,
I was on the 1 2th.

508
00:35:16,826 --> 00:35:20,455
I rode up nine extra floors
just to keep talking to her.

509
00:35:20,581 --> 00:35:23,041
Nine extra floors.

510
00:35:33,218 --> 00:35:35,846
- Hello.
- You sleeping?

511
00:35:35,971 --> 00:35:38,724
- No, I was watching "Casablanca".
- Channel?

512
00:35:38,849 --> 00:35:41,561
- Eleven.
- Thank you. Got it.

513
00:35:41,977 --> 00:35:45,773
So you'd be happier with Victor Laszlo
than with Humphrey Bogart?

514
00:35:45,898 --> 00:35:48,983
- When did I say that?
- When we drove to New York.

515
00:35:49,110 --> 00:35:53,572
- I never said that. I'd never say that.
- All right, fine. Have it your way.

516
00:35:55,449 --> 00:35:57,576
- Have you been sleeping?
- Why?

517
00:35:57,702 --> 00:36:01,622
Cos I haven't been sleeping.
I really miss Helen.

518
00:36:02,999 --> 00:36:08,295
Maybe I'm coming down with something. I
watched "Leave It to Beaver" in Spanish.

519
00:36:08,504 --> 00:36:12,300
"Buenos días, Seòor Cleaver.
?Dónde están Wallace y Theodore?"

520
00:36:12,427 --> 00:36:13,635
I'm not well.

521
00:36:13,802 --> 00:36:17,723
I went to bed at 7.30.
I haven't done that since third grade.

522
00:36:17,847 --> 00:36:20,892
That's the good thing
about depression - you rest.

523
00:36:21,017 --> 00:36:24,104
- I'm not depressed.
- OK. Fine.

524
00:36:24,354 --> 00:36:27,107
Do you still sleep
on the same side ofthe bed?

525
00:36:27,232 --> 00:36:29,818
I did for a while,
but now I'm using the whole bed.

526
00:36:29,944 --> 00:36:34,906
God, that's great. I feel weird
when just my leg wanders over.

527
00:36:35,782 --> 00:36:37,868
I miss her.

528
00:36:37,993 --> 00:36:41,580
- I don't miss him. I really don't.
- Not even a little?

529
00:36:41,705 --> 00:36:43,749
You know what I miss?

530
00:36:43,874 --> 00:36:46,169
I miss the idea ofhim.

531
00:36:47,836 --> 00:36:50,298
Maybe I only miss the idea ofHelen.

532
00:36:51,131 --> 00:36:53,592
No, I miss the whole Helen.

533
00:36:56,429 --> 00:36:58,514
Last scene.

534
00:37:01,683 --> 00:37:04,687
Goodbye, Rick. God bless you.

535
00:37:05,646 --> 00:37:08,608
lngrid Bergman. She's low maintenance.

536
00:37:08,733 --> 00:37:11,319
- Low maintenance?
- There are two kinds of women.

537
00:37:11,444 --> 00:37:15,739
- High maintenance and low maintenance.
- And lngrid is low maintenance?

538
00:37:15,864 --> 00:37:17,783
An LM, definitely.

539
00:37:17,908 --> 00:37:19,952
- Which one am I?
- The worst kind.

540
00:37:20,078 --> 00:37:22,872
You're high maintenance,
but you think you're low.

541
00:37:22,997 --> 00:37:25,166
- I don't see that.
- You don't see that?

542
00:37:25,291 --> 00:37:28,378
"Waiter, a house salad,
but not the regular dressing."

543
00:37:28,503 --> 00:37:30,923
"I'll have balsamic vinegar - on the side."

544
00:37:31,048 --> 00:37:34,468
"Then salmon with mustard sauce,
but I want the sauce on the side."

545
00:37:34,592 --> 00:37:38,429
- "On the side" is a big thing for you.
- I just want it the way I want it.

546
00:37:38,554 --> 00:37:40,599
I know. High maintenance.

547
00:37:40,766 --> 00:37:43,852
.. 10,000F should pay our expenses.

548
00:37:43,977 --> 00:37:46,020
Our expenses?

549
00:37:46,145 --> 00:37:50,525
Louis, I think this is the beginning
of a beautiful friendship.

550
00:37:51,944 --> 00:37:55,197
Best last line of a movie ever.

551
00:37:58,117 --> 00:38:02,621
I'm definitely coming down with
something. Probably a 24-hour tumour.

552
00:38:02,746 --> 00:38:04,916
- You don't have a tumour.
- How do you know?

553
00:38:05,041 --> 00:38:10,087
- If you're so worried, go see a doctor.
- No, he'll just tell me it's nothing.

554
00:38:10,212 --> 00:38:12,756
- Will you be able to sleep?
- If not, I'll be OK.

555
00:38:12,881 --> 00:38:16,135
- What'll you do?
- I'll stay up and moan.

556
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:19,139
Maybe I should practise now.

557
00:38:24,517 --> 00:38:27,063
Good night, Harry.

558
00:38:27,188 --> 00:38:29,232
Good night.

559
00:39:04,852 --> 00:39:08,938
I had my dream again - where I'm making
love and Olympic judges are watching?

560
00:39:09,064 --> 00:39:11,942
I'd nailed the compulsories,
so this is it: the finals.

561
00:39:12,068 --> 00:39:15,528
I got a 9.8 from the Canadian,
a perfect 10 from the American,

562
00:39:15,653 --> 00:39:19,200
and my mother, disguised as
an East German judge, gave me a 5.6.

563
00:39:19,324 --> 00:39:21,619
Must've been the dismount.

564
00:39:21,995 --> 00:39:24,955
Basically it's the same one
I've had since I was 1 2.

565
00:39:25,081 --> 00:39:27,833
- What happens?
- No, it's... It's too embarrassing.

566
00:39:27,958 --> 00:39:30,335
- Don't tell me.
- OK, there's this guy.

567
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:34,132
- What's he look like?
- I don't know. He's just kinda faceless.

568
00:39:34,257 --> 00:39:37,552
A faceless guy. OK. Then what happens?

569
00:39:37,676 --> 00:39:39,762
He rips off my clothes.

570
00:39:39,887 --> 00:39:43,934
- Then what happens?
- That's it.

571
00:39:44,727 --> 00:39:47,645
That's it? A faceless guy
rips off your clothes.

572
00:39:47,771 --> 00:39:52,024
And that's the sex fantasy you've had
since you were 12. Exactly the same?

573
00:39:52,149 --> 00:39:54,902
Well, sometimes I vary it a little.

574
00:39:55,027 --> 00:39:57,490
- Which part?
- What I'm wearing.

575
00:40:02,703 --> 00:40:04,996
- What?
- Nothing.

576
00:40:06,874 --> 00:40:10,502
I have decided that for today

577
00:40:10,627 --> 00:40:13,255
we are going to talk like this.

578
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:16,633
- Like this?
- No. To repeat after me.

579
00:40:16,758 --> 00:40:17,843
- Pepper.
- Pepper.

580
00:40:17,968 --> 00:40:18,927
- Pepper.
- Pepper!

581
00:40:19,053 --> 00:40:19,887
- Pepper.
- Pepper.

582
00:40:20,012 --> 00:40:20,721
- Pepper.
- Pepper.

583
00:40:20,846 --> 00:40:25,015
Waiter, there is too much pepper
on my paprikash.

584
00:40:25,726 --> 00:40:30,106
Waiter, there is too much pepper
on my paprikash.

585
00:40:30,272 --> 00:40:33,567
But I would be proud
to partake of your pecan pie.

586
00:40:33,693 --> 00:40:35,361
Oh, no!

587
00:40:35,485 --> 00:40:37,530
- But I would be proud.
- But I would be proud.

588
00:40:37,655 --> 00:40:38,823
- To partake.
- To partake.

589
00:40:38,948 --> 00:40:41,950
- Of your pecan pie.
- Of your pecan pie.

590
00:40:42,076 --> 00:40:43,703
- Pecan pie.
- Pecan pie.

591
00:40:43,829 --> 00:40:47,497
- Pecan pie.
- Pecan pie!

592
00:40:47,664 --> 00:40:51,170
- Would you like to go to the movies?
- Would you like to go...

593
00:40:51,295 --> 00:40:57,258
Not to repeat. Please, to answer. Would
you like to go to the movies tonight?

594
00:40:59,385 --> 00:41:01,429
Well, I'd love to, Harry, but I can't.

595
00:41:01,721 --> 00:41:04,641
What do you have? A hot date?

596
00:41:04,891 --> 00:41:07,310
- Well, yeah. Yeah.
- Really?

597
00:41:07,436 --> 00:41:11,689
Yeah. I was gonna tell you,
but, I don't know, I felt strange about it.

598
00:41:11,856 --> 00:41:14,359
- Why?
- Cos we've spent so much time together.

599
00:41:14,485 --> 00:41:17,153
I think it's great that you have a date.

600
00:41:17,279 --> 00:41:19,322
- You do?
- Yeah.

601
00:41:25,913 --> 00:41:28,791
- Is that what you're gonna wear?
- Yeah.

602
00:41:28,916 --> 00:41:32,001
Well, I don't know. Why?

603
00:41:32,418 --> 00:41:36,131
I think you should wear skirts more.
You look really good in skirts.

604
00:41:36,257 --> 00:41:38,842
- I do?
- Yeah.

605
00:41:40,343 --> 00:41:45,473
I think hieroglyphics are really a comic
strip about a character named Sphinxy.

606
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:49,186
- Harry, you should get out there, too.
- I'm not ready.

607
00:41:49,311 --> 00:41:52,814
- You should.
- I would not be good for anybody now.

608
00:41:52,939 --> 00:41:54,691
It's time.

609
00:41:54,983 --> 00:41:58,196
It was the most
uncomfortable night of my life.

610
00:41:58,321 --> 00:42:00,364
See, no, it has to go this way.

611
00:42:01,490 --> 00:42:04,327
The first date back
is always the toughest, Harry.

612
00:42:04,452 --> 00:42:06,496
You only had one date.

613
00:42:06,621 --> 00:42:10,041
- How do you know it won't get worse?
- How much worse can it get

614
00:42:10,165 --> 00:42:15,713
than finishing dinner, having him pull
a hair out of my head and floss with it?

615
00:42:15,838 --> 00:42:18,716
We're talking dream date
compared to my horror.

616
00:42:18,841 --> 00:42:22,388
It started out fine.
She's a very nice person.

617
00:42:22,512 --> 00:42:26,223
And we're talking in this Ethiopian
restaurant she wanted to go to.

618
00:42:26,349 --> 00:42:29,769
I was making jokes, like
"I didn't know they had food in Ethiopia."

619
00:42:29,894 --> 00:42:33,648
"This'll be a quick meal. I'll order
two empty plates and we can leave."

620
00:42:33,773 --> 00:42:36,068
Yeah! Nothing from her, not even a smile.

621
00:42:36,193 --> 00:42:39,445
I downshift into small talk
and ask where she went to school.

622
00:42:39,570 --> 00:42:42,783
She says Michigan State.
And this reminds me of Helen.

623
00:42:42,992 --> 00:42:46,161
All of a sudden I'm in the middle
of an anxiety attack -

624
00:42:46,286 --> 00:42:49,289
my heart's beatin' fast
and I start sweatin' like a pig.

625
00:42:49,414 --> 00:42:52,376
- Helen went to Michigan State?
- No, Northwestern.

626
00:42:52,502 --> 00:42:54,754
But they're both Big Ten schools.

627
00:42:54,879 --> 00:42:57,965
I got so upset
I had to leave the restaurant.

628
00:43:00,009 --> 00:43:02,385
Harry, I think this takes a long time.

629
00:43:02,510 --> 00:43:06,767
It might be months before we're able
to enjoy going out with someone new.

630
00:43:06,892 --> 00:43:07,892
Yeah.

631
00:43:08,017 --> 00:43:11,312
Maybe longer before we're able
to go to bed with someone new.

632
00:43:11,436 --> 00:43:13,773
I went to bed with her.

633
00:43:15,025 --> 00:43:17,943
- You went to bed with her?!
- Sure.

634
00:43:23,949 --> 00:43:26,953
- I don't understand this relationship.
- What d'ya mean?

635
00:43:27,079 --> 00:43:28,789
- Enjoy being with her?
- Yeah.

636
00:43:28,914 --> 00:43:30,956
- You find her attractive?
- Yeah.

637
00:43:31,082 --> 00:43:33,292
- And you're not sleeping with her?
- No.

638
00:43:33,418 --> 00:43:35,669
You're afraid to let yourself be happy.

639
00:43:35,795 --> 00:43:39,215
Why can't you gimme credit for this?
This is a big thing for me.

640
00:43:39,341 --> 00:43:43,220
I never had a relationship with a woman
that didn't involve sex. I'm growing.

641
00:43:43,345 --> 00:43:46,972
- Are you finished?
- I got a stack o' quarters. I was here first.

642
00:43:47,098 --> 00:43:47,973
- Were not.
- Was too.

643
00:43:48,099 --> 00:43:50,061
- Were not!
- Was too!

644
00:43:50,186 --> 00:43:52,772
- Big jerk.
- Little creep.

645
00:43:52,896 --> 00:43:54,773
- Where was I?
- You were growing.

646
00:43:54,897 --> 00:43:56,525
Yeah.

647
00:43:56,650 --> 00:43:59,862
It's very freeing. I can say anything to her.

648
00:44:00,529 --> 00:44:03,825
Are you saying you can say things to her
you can't say to me?

649
00:44:03,950 --> 00:44:08,786
No, it's just a different perspective.
I get the woman's point of view on things.

650
00:44:08,911 --> 00:44:12,667
She tells me about the men she sees,
and I talk to her about the women I see.

651
00:44:12,792 --> 00:44:14,961
- You tell her about other women?
- Yeah.

652
00:44:15,086 --> 00:44:18,755
Like the other night, I made love
to this woman and it was incredible.

653
00:44:18,881 --> 00:44:22,636
I took her to a place that wasn't human.
She actually meowed.

654
00:44:22,761 --> 00:44:27,265
- You made a woman meow?
- Yeah, and I can say these things to her.

655
00:44:27,390 --> 00:44:31,810
And the great thing is, I don't have to lie
because I don't wanna get her into bed.

656
00:44:31,935 --> 00:44:35,983
- I can just be myself.
- You made a woman meow?

657
00:44:37,024 --> 00:44:40,068
What do you do with these women?
Just get up and leave?

658
00:44:40,193 --> 00:44:43,614
- Sure.
- Explain how you do it. What do you say?

659
00:44:43,740 --> 00:44:46,325
I say I have an early meeting,
early squash game.

660
00:44:46,451 --> 00:44:50,748
- You don't play squash.
- They don't know that. They just met me.

661
00:44:50,873 --> 00:44:53,707
- That's disgusting.
- I know. I feel terrible.

662
00:44:53,832 --> 00:44:56,086
I'm so glad I never got involved with you.

663
00:44:56,211 --> 00:45:00,173
I just would've been some woman you
had to get outta bed and leave at 3am

664
00:45:00,298 --> 00:45:03,551
and go clean your andirons.
You don't even have a fireplace.

665
00:45:03,676 --> 00:45:07,515
- Not that I would know this.
- Why are you upset? This isn't about you.

666
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:11,810
Yes, it is! You are a human affront
to all women, and I am a woman.

667
00:45:11,934 --> 00:45:14,813
Hey, I don't hear anyone complaining.

668
00:45:14,937 --> 00:45:17,816
Of course not.
You're out the door too fast.

669
00:45:17,941 --> 00:45:21,279
- I think they have an OK time.
- How do you know?

670
00:45:21,863 --> 00:45:24,238
What d'ya mean how do I know? I know.

671
00:45:24,363 --> 00:45:28,202
- Because they...
- Yes, because they...

672
00:45:28,828 --> 00:45:33,917
- How do you know that they're really...
- What're you saying? They fake orgasm?

673
00:45:34,416 --> 00:45:36,752
- It's possible.
- Get outta here!

674
00:45:36,877 --> 00:45:39,964
Why? Most women
at one time or another have faked it.

675
00:45:40,382 --> 00:45:43,301
- They haven't faked it with me.
- How do you know?

676
00:45:44,469 --> 00:45:47,137
Because I know.

677
00:45:48,806 --> 00:45:50,892
Right. That's right.

678
00:45:51,017 --> 00:45:53,311
I forgot. You're a man.

679
00:45:53,477 --> 00:45:55,646
- What is that supposed to mean?
- Nothing.

680
00:45:55,772 --> 00:45:59,567
All men are sure it never happened
to them and most women have done it,

681
00:45:59,691 --> 00:46:01,735
so you do the math.

682
00:46:01,862 --> 00:46:04,448
You don't think I could tell the difference?

683
00:46:04,572 --> 00:46:07,368
- No.
- Get outta here.

684
00:46:21,798 --> 00:46:23,465
Are you OK?

685
00:46:27,471 --> 00:46:29,432
Oh, God.

686
00:46:30,765 --> 00:46:33,017
Oh, God.

687
00:46:39,691 --> 00:46:42,319
Oh, God.

688
00:46:42,444 --> 00:46:44,154
Oh, yeah, right there.

689
00:46:50,745 --> 00:46:52,955
Oh, God.

690
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:56,167
Yes! Yes! Yes!

691
00:46:56,417 --> 00:46:58,003
Yes! Yes!

692
00:46:58,128 --> 00:47:00,172
Yes!

693
00:47:01,589 --> 00:47:04,550
Oh, yes! Yes! Yes!

694
00:47:06,011 --> 00:47:08,971
Yes! Yes! Yes!

695
00:47:09,096 --> 00:47:11,475
Yes! Yes! Yes!

696
00:47:15,352 --> 00:47:17,396
Oh, God.

697
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:29,075
I'll have what she's having.

698
00:47:30,910 --> 00:47:33,163
Sleigh bells ring

699
00:47:33,288 --> 00:47:35,248
Are you listening?

700
00:47:35,665 --> 00:47:39,668
ln the lane snow is glistening

701
00:47:40,128 --> 00:47:42,255
A beautiful sight

702
00:47:42,381 --> 00:47:44,759
We're happy tonight

703
00:47:44,884 --> 00:47:47,928
Walking in a winter wonderland

704
00:47:48,053 --> 00:47:51,890
Gone away is the bluebird

705
00:47:52,391 --> 00:47:56,771
Here to stay is a new bird

706
00:47:57,729 --> 00:48:01,817
He sings a love song as we go along

707
00:48:01,942 --> 00:48:05,613
Walking in a winter wonderland

708
00:48:06,072 --> 00:48:09,575
ln the meadow we can build a snowman

709
00:48:10,410 --> 00:48:14,163
And pretend that he is Parson Brown

710
00:48:14,830 --> 00:48:16,499
He'll say "Are you married?"

711
00:48:16,624 --> 00:48:19,001
We'll say "No, man"

712
00:48:19,127 --> 00:48:22,963
"But you can do thejob
when you're in town, brother"

713
00:48:23,130 --> 00:48:27,261
Later on we'll conspire

714
00:48:28,302 --> 00:48:31,806
As we dream by the fire

715
00:48:32,515 --> 00:48:36,728
To face unafraid the plans that we made

716
00:48:36,853 --> 00:48:39,690
Walking in a winter wonderland

717
00:48:41,023 --> 00:48:44,360
lfthey asked me

718
00:48:44,527 --> 00:48:46,988
I could write a book

719
00:48:48,656 --> 00:48:53,077
About the way you walk and whisper...

720
00:48:53,202 --> 00:48:56,956
- I like you with no beard. I see your face.
- It is my face!

721
00:48:58,208 --> 00:49:00,419
Whoa! Dipping you.

722
00:49:03,338 --> 00:49:06,592
- Thank you for taking me out tonight.
- Don't be silly.

723
00:49:06,717 --> 00:49:10,636
The next New Year's Eve, if neither
of us is with anybody, you got a date.

724
00:49:10,762 --> 00:49:12,557
Deal.

725
00:49:13,725 --> 00:49:16,727
See? Now we can dance cheek to cheek.

726
00:49:19,605 --> 00:49:22,150
lsjust to tell them

727
00:49:22,316 --> 00:49:25,402
That I love you a lot

728
00:49:26,863 --> 00:49:31,658
Then the world discovers

729
00:49:31,825 --> 00:49:35,663
As my book ends

730
00:49:35,830 --> 00:49:40,000
How to make two lovers

731
00:49:40,125 --> 00:49:42,253
Of friends

732
00:49:42,420 --> 00:49:46,007
Hey, everybody!
Ten seconds to New Year!

733
00:49:46,174 --> 00:49:48,468
- Ten,...
- Wanna get some air?

734
00:49:48,635 --> 00:49:51,721
- Yeah.
- ..seven, six, five, four,

735
00:49:51,846 --> 00:49:54,140
three, two, one!

736
00:49:54,306 --> 00:49:56,351
Happy New Year!

737
00:50:17,789 --> 00:50:19,917
- Happy New Year.
- Happy New Year.

738
00:50:27,465 --> 00:50:32,722
He was a head counsellor at boys' camp,
I was a head counsellor at girls' camp,

739
00:50:32,888 --> 00:50:36,727
and they had a social one night,
and he walked across the room.

740
00:50:36,892 --> 00:50:39,895
I thought he was coming
to talk to my friend Maxine,

741
00:50:40,020 --> 00:50:43,775
cos people were always
crossing rooms to talk to Maxine.

742
00:50:43,900 --> 00:50:46,735
But he was coming to talk to me,
and he said

743
00:50:46,861 --> 00:50:49,864
"I'm Ben Small
of the Coney lsland Smalls."

744
00:50:49,989 --> 00:50:54,452
At that moment I knew. I knew
the way you know about a good melon.

745
00:50:56,454 --> 00:50:59,124
You sent flowers to yourself.

746
00:50:59,249 --> 00:51:03,003
$60 I spent on this big arrangement
of flowers, and I wrote a card

747
00:51:03,170 --> 00:51:07,215
that I planned to leave on the table
where Arthur would just happen to see it.

748
00:51:07,382 --> 00:51:09,675
What did the card say?

749
00:51:09,842 --> 00:51:12,386
"Please say yes. Love Jonathan."

750
00:51:12,553 --> 00:51:14,682
- Did it work?
- He never even came over.

751
00:51:14,848 --> 00:51:18,893
He forgot a charity thing his wife is
chairman of. He's never gonna leave her!

752
00:51:19,061 --> 00:51:22,481
- Of course he isn't.
- You're right. I know you're right.

753
00:51:22,606 --> 00:51:26,193
- Where is this place?
- Somewhere on the next block.

754
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:28,153
I can't believe I'm doing this.

755
00:51:28,279 --> 00:51:31,781
Harry is one of my best friends
and you are one of my best friends.

756
00:51:31,907 --> 00:51:36,287
And if you two hit it off, we could still
be friends, instead of drifting apart

757
00:51:36,454 --> 00:51:39,539
like you do when you date someone
who doesn't know your friends.

758
00:51:39,664 --> 00:51:43,710
You and I haven't drifted apart
since I started seeing Arthur.

759
00:51:43,835 --> 00:51:47,422
If Arthur ever left his wife
and I actually met him,

760
00:51:47,590 --> 00:51:51,094
I am sure that you and I would drift apart.

761
00:51:51,219 --> 00:51:53,261
He's never gonna leave her.

762
00:51:53,428 --> 00:51:55,472
Of course he isn't.

763
00:51:55,640 --> 00:51:57,724
You're right. I know you're right.

764
00:51:58,309 --> 00:52:00,520
- I dunno about this.
- It's just a dinner.

765
00:52:00,686 --> 00:52:05,817
I've finally gotten to a place where I'm
comfortable with just me and my work.

766
00:52:05,983 --> 00:52:09,737
- If she's so great why don't you date her?
- I told you. We're just friends.

767
00:52:09,904 --> 00:52:12,741
- So she's not attractive?
- No, she is attractive.

768
00:52:12,866 --> 00:52:17,411
- You said she had a good personality.
- She has a good personality.

769
00:52:19,080 --> 00:52:20,456
What?

770
00:52:20,624 --> 00:52:24,920
When someone's not attractive, they're
described as having a good personality.

771
00:52:25,045 --> 00:52:28,799
If you'd asked about looks and
I'd said "She has a good personality",

772
00:52:28,966 --> 00:52:30,757
she's not attractive.

773
00:52:30,882 --> 00:52:34,388
But because I mentioned she has
a good personality, she can be either.

774
00:52:34,555 --> 00:52:38,307
Attractive with a good personality,
or not attractive with a good personality.

775
00:52:38,474 --> 00:52:40,476
- So which one is she?
- Attractive.

776
00:52:40,643 --> 00:52:42,856
But not beautiful, right?

777
00:52:45,566 --> 00:52:50,612
It's like, whenever I read Jimmy Breslin,
it's as if he's leaving a wake-up call

778
00:52:50,779 --> 00:52:54,908
- for the City of New York.
- What d'you mean by a "wake-up call"?

779
00:52:55,034 --> 00:52:59,246
He's saying that we've got people
in the city who are on welfare...

780
00:53:00,705 --> 00:53:02,708
Would I have seen any of your windows?

781
00:53:02,874 --> 00:53:07,338
A couple of weeks ago
I did a thing with hostages.

782
00:53:07,464 --> 00:53:09,256
- The people in blindfolds.
- Yeah.

783
00:53:09,799 --> 00:53:12,926
I thought it was like late '80s.

784
00:53:13,678 --> 00:53:15,054
That's interesting.

785
00:53:15,220 --> 00:53:18,141
Let's just say I'm not
a big fan of Jimmy Breslin.

786
00:53:18,308 --> 00:53:22,812
Well, he's the reason I became a writer,
but that's not important.

787
00:53:35,741 --> 00:53:39,245
Harry, you and Marie
are both from New Jersey.

788
00:53:39,412 --> 00:53:40,872
- Really?
- Where?

789
00:53:41,039 --> 00:53:42,624
- South Orange.
- Haddonfield.

790
00:53:50,674 --> 00:53:54,761
- So, what are we gonna order?
- I'm gonna start with the grilled radicchio.

791
00:53:54,928 --> 00:53:58,307
Jess, Sally is a great orderer.
Not only does she pick the best,

792
00:53:58,474 --> 00:54:02,019
but she orders it in a way even the chef
didn't know how good it could be.

793
00:54:02,186 --> 00:54:05,314
- Restaurants have become too important.
- I agree.

794
00:54:05,481 --> 00:54:09,734
"Restaurants are to people in the '80s
what theatre was to people in the '60s."

795
00:54:09,902 --> 00:54:12,279
I read that in a magazine.

796
00:54:12,446 --> 00:54:14,491
I wrote that.

797
00:54:14,658 --> 00:54:17,325
- Get outta here.
- No, I did! I wrote that.

798
00:54:17,576 --> 00:54:20,830
I've never quoted anything
from a magazine. That's amazing.

799
00:54:20,996 --> 00:54:24,500
Don't you think that's amazing?
And you wrote it?

800
00:54:24,667 --> 00:54:27,129
I also wrote
"Pesto is the quiche of the '80s."

801
00:54:27,295 --> 00:54:30,006
- Get over yourself!
- I did!

802
00:54:30,338 --> 00:54:32,758
- Where did I read that?
- New York Magazine.

803
00:54:32,925 --> 00:54:35,262
Sally writes for New York Magazine.

804
00:54:35,387 --> 00:54:39,682
You know, that piece had a real impact
on me. I don't know much about writing...

805
00:54:39,807 --> 00:54:42,017
It spoke to you, and that pleases me.

806
00:54:42,143 --> 00:54:45,772
I mean, you have to admire people
who can be that articulate.

807
00:54:45,896 --> 00:54:49,526
Nobody has ever quoted
me back to me before.

808
00:54:59,619 --> 00:55:02,706
I've been looking for a red suede pump.

809
00:55:04,750 --> 00:55:07,252
What do you think of Jess?

810
00:55:08,211 --> 00:55:11,591
- Well...
- Do you think you could go out with him?

811
00:55:12,424 --> 00:55:16,260
- I don't know...
- Cos I feel really comfortable with him.

812
00:55:16,385 --> 00:55:19,640
- You wanna go out with Jess.
- If it would be all right with you.

813
00:55:19,766 --> 00:55:22,768
Sure. Sure. I'm just worried about Harry.

814
00:55:22,893 --> 00:55:27,981
He's sensitive, he's going through a rough
period, and I don't want you to reject him.

815
00:55:28,107 --> 00:55:30,401
I wouldn't. I totally understand.

816
00:55:30,526 --> 00:55:34,030
If you don't think you're gonna call Marie,
do you mind if I call her?

817
00:55:34,155 --> 00:55:35,782
- No, no.
- Good. Good.

818
00:55:35,990 --> 00:55:40,118
But for tonight you shouldn't.
I mean, Sally's very vulnerable right now.

819
00:55:40,243 --> 00:55:44,248
You can call Marie, but wait a week or so.
Don't make any moves tonight.

820
00:55:44,373 --> 00:55:48,001
Fine. No problem.
I wasn't even thinking about tonight.

821
00:55:48,628 --> 00:55:52,299
Well, I don't feel like walking any more.
I think I'll get a cab.

822
00:55:52,424 --> 00:55:55,510
- I'll go with you.
- Great! Taxi!

823
00:56:07,147 --> 00:56:12,777
A man came to me and said
"I found nice girl for you."

824
00:56:12,902 --> 00:56:17,073
"She lives in the next village

825
00:56:17,199 --> 00:56:20,494
and she is ready for marriage."

826
00:56:21,662 --> 00:56:25,958
We were not supposed to meet
until the wedding,

827
00:56:26,083 --> 00:56:28,168
but I wanted to make sure.

828
00:56:28,293 --> 00:56:32,630
So I sneak into her village,
hid behind a tree,

829
00:56:32,755 --> 00:56:35,509
watch her washing the clothes.

830
00:56:36,301 --> 00:56:42,099
I think if I don't like the way she looks,
I don't marry her.

831
00:56:42,224 --> 00:56:45,060
But she looked very nice to me.

832
00:56:45,185 --> 00:56:48,272
So I said "OK" to the man.

833
00:56:49,023 --> 00:56:50,859
We get married.

834
00:56:50,983 --> 00:56:53,986
We married for 55 years.

835
00:56:56,697 --> 00:56:59,951
FOUR MONTHS LATER

836
00:57:01,243 --> 00:57:04,455
- I have to get this.
- Harry, we're here for Jess and Marie.

837
00:57:04,580 --> 00:57:08,459
- We'll find something. Great stuff.
- Should have gone to the plant store.

838
00:57:08,584 --> 00:57:11,838
- Here. Perfect for them.
- What's that?

839
00:57:11,964 --> 00:57:14,591
Battery-operated pith helmet, with fan.

840
00:57:14,967 --> 00:57:17,676
- Why is this necessary in life?
- I don't know.

841
00:57:17,801 --> 00:57:20,764
Look at this. Also makes great fries.

842
00:57:21,932 --> 00:57:24,934
Good. Call off the dogs. The hunt is over.

843
00:57:25,060 --> 00:57:27,979
Sally, this is the greatest.

844
00:57:28,104 --> 00:57:30,397
Sally, please report to me.

845
00:57:30,522 --> 00:57:33,319
Look. This is the greatest.
You're gonna love this.

846
00:57:33,443 --> 00:57:38,740
This is a singing machine. Look, you sing
the lead and this has the backup.

847
00:57:38,865 --> 00:57:41,993
- This is from Oklahoma!
- "Surrey with the Fringe on Top".

848
00:57:42,118 --> 00:57:44,539
Yes, perfect.

849
00:57:46,456 --> 00:57:49,460
Chicks and ducks and geese
better scurry

850
00:57:49,585 --> 00:57:52,505
When I take you out in my surrey

851
00:57:52,630 --> 00:57:56,843
When I take you out in my surrey
with the fringe on top

852
00:57:56,967 --> 00:57:58,177
Now you!

853
00:57:58,303 --> 00:58:00,804
Watch that fringe and see how it flutters

854
00:58:00,929 --> 00:58:03,681
When I drive those
high-steppin' strutters

855
00:58:03,807 --> 00:58:05,810
Nosey pokes'll
peek through the shutters

856
00:58:05,936 --> 00:58:08,521
And their eyes will pop!

857
00:58:08,646 --> 00:58:11,775
The wheels are yellow,
the upholstery's brown

858
00:58:11,899 --> 00:58:14,110
The dashboard's genuine leather

859
00:58:14,236 --> 00:58:16,903
With isinglass curtains that will ro...

860
00:58:17,364 --> 00:58:19,116
What?

861
00:58:19,241 --> 00:58:22,327
It's my voice, isn't it? You hate my voice.

862
00:58:22,452 --> 00:58:25,955
- I know, it's terrible. Joe hated it...
- It's Helen.

863
00:58:26,080 --> 00:58:28,040
Helen?

864
00:58:28,165 --> 00:58:30,626
She's coming right towards me.

865
00:58:38,384 --> 00:58:41,889
- How are you, Harry?
- Fine. I'm fine.

866
00:58:43,724 --> 00:58:46,476
This is Ira Stone. Harry Burns.

867
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:48,436
Harry.

868
00:58:52,858 --> 00:58:55,943
I'm sorry. This is Sally Albright.
Helen Hillson

869
00:58:56,069 --> 00:58:57,904
and Ira.

870
00:58:58,155 --> 00:58:59,991
Sally.

871
00:59:00,116 --> 00:59:03,243
- Nice to meet you.
- Hi.

872
00:59:05,496 --> 00:59:07,373
Well...

873
00:59:08,122 --> 00:59:11,501
- See you.
- Yeah. Bye.

874
00:59:12,837 --> 00:59:15,298
Nice to meet you, Ira.

875
00:59:20,469 --> 00:59:22,513
You OK?

876
00:59:23,763 --> 00:59:26,267
Yeah, I'm perfect.

877
00:59:26,392 --> 00:59:29,771
She looked weird, didn't she?
She looked really weird.

878
00:59:29,896 --> 00:59:33,648
- I've never seen her before.
- Trust me. Her legs looked heavy.

879
00:59:33,774 --> 00:59:35,611
- Must be retaining water.
- Harry!

880
00:59:35,736 --> 00:59:38,446
Believe me, the woman saved everything.

881
00:59:41,574 --> 00:59:43,659
Sure you're OK?

882
00:59:43,785 --> 00:59:46,704
I'm fine.
Look, it had to happen at some point.

883
00:59:46,829 --> 00:59:51,000
In a city of eight million, you're bound
to run into your ex-wife. So it happened.

884
00:59:51,125 --> 00:59:53,168
And now I'm fine.

885
00:59:56,214 --> 00:59:58,967
I like it. It works. It says "home" to me.

886
00:59:59,094 --> 01:00:02,929
All right. All right.
We'll let Harry and Sally be the judge.

887
01:00:03,555 --> 01:00:06,057
What do you think?

888
01:00:06,182 --> 01:00:08,100
- It's nice.
- Case closed.

889
01:00:08,225 --> 01:00:10,687
Of course he likes it - he's a guy.

890
01:00:10,813 --> 01:00:12,856
Sally?

891
01:00:14,483 --> 01:00:15,900
What's so awful about it?

892
01:00:16,025 --> 01:00:20,114
It's so awful, there's no way to begin
to explain what's so awful about it.

893
01:00:20,239 --> 01:00:22,534
Honey, I don't object to your things.

894
01:00:22,659 --> 01:00:26,286
If we had room, you could put
your things in it, like your bar stools...

895
01:00:26,412 --> 01:00:30,332
Honey, wait, wait. Honey, wait.
You don't like my bar stools?

896
01:00:31,166 --> 01:00:33,837
Harry, come on,
someone has to be on my side.

897
01:00:33,962 --> 01:00:36,798
I'm on your side.
I just want you to have good taste.

898
01:00:36,922 --> 01:00:39,174
I have good taste!

899
01:00:39,299 --> 01:00:44,347
Everybody thinks they have good taste,
but they couldn't all have good taste.

900
01:00:44,472 --> 01:00:48,309
You know, it's funny.
We started out like this, Helen and I.

901
01:00:48,435 --> 01:00:52,896
We hung things, we picked out tiles
together. Then you know what happens?

902
01:00:53,147 --> 01:00:58,528
Six years later you're singing "Surrey
with the Fringe on Top" in front of lra!

903
01:00:58,653 --> 01:01:03,532
- Do we have to talk about this right now?
- Yes. Right now is the perfect time,

904
01:01:03,658 --> 01:01:07,705
because I want our friends to benefit
from the wisdom of my experience.

905
01:01:07,830 --> 01:01:12,375
Right now everything is great. Everyone
is happy and in love, and that's wonderful.

906
01:01:12,500 --> 01:01:17,881
But sooner or later, you'll be screaming
at each other about who'll get this dish.

907
01:01:18,007 --> 01:01:23,093
This $8 dish will cost $1 ,000 in calls to the
legal firm of "That's mine, this is yours".

908
01:01:23,219 --> 01:01:25,180
- Harry!
- Please.

909
01:01:25,305 --> 01:01:28,517
Jess, Marie,
do me a favour for your own good.

910
01:01:28,642 --> 01:01:32,937
Put your name in your books right now
before you don't know whose is whose,

911
01:01:33,064 --> 01:01:38,193
because some day you'll go 1 5 rounds
over who's gonna get this coffee table.

912
01:01:38,527 --> 01:01:43,908
This stupid, wagon-wheel,
Roy-Rogers, garage-sale coffee table!

913
01:01:45,700 --> 01:01:49,414
- I thought you liked it.
- I was being nice!

914
01:01:53,751 --> 01:01:55,835
He just bumped into Helen.

915
01:02:03,511 --> 01:02:06,305
I want you to know

916
01:02:06,430 --> 01:02:10,559
that I will never want
that wagon-wheel coffee table.

917
01:02:19,276 --> 01:02:22,448
I know, I know, I shouldn't have done it.

918
01:02:22,573 --> 01:02:27,327
Harry, you have to try to find a way of
not expressing every feeling you have,

919
01:02:27,452 --> 01:02:29,496
every moment that you have them.

920
01:02:29,621 --> 01:02:32,164
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

921
01:02:32,290 --> 01:02:34,960
There are times and places for things.

922
01:02:35,836 --> 01:02:40,924
Well, the next time you're giving a lecture
on social graces, tell me cos I'll sign up.

923
01:02:41,049 --> 01:02:44,679
Hey! You don't have
to take your anger out on me.

924
01:02:44,804 --> 01:02:46,888
I'm entitled to throw anger your way.

925
01:02:47,013 --> 01:02:51,143
Especially when I'm being told how
to live my life by Miss Hospital Corners!

926
01:02:51,269 --> 01:02:54,813
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Nothing bothers you!

927
01:02:54,937 --> 01:02:58,651
- You never get upset about anything!
- Don't be ridiculous!

928
01:02:58,776 --> 01:03:00,194
What?

929
01:03:00,319 --> 01:03:04,656
You never get upset about Joe. I never
see it back up on you. How is it possible?

930
01:03:04,781 --> 01:03:09,078
- Don't you experience feelings of loss?
- I don't have to take this crap.

931
01:03:09,203 --> 01:03:12,790
- If you're over Joe, why not see people?
- I see people!

932
01:03:12,915 --> 01:03:16,376
See people! Have you slept
with one person since Joe?

933
01:03:16,501 --> 01:03:19,297
What the hell does that
have to do with anything?

934
01:03:19,422 --> 01:03:23,341
That will prove I'm over Joe
because I fuck somebody?!

935
01:03:23,467 --> 01:03:27,430
You have to move back to New Jersey cos
you've slept with everyone in New York.

936
01:03:27,555 --> 01:03:31,059
I don't see that turning Helen
into a faint memory for you.

937
01:03:31,184 --> 01:03:34,228
Besides, I will make love
when it is making love.

938
01:03:34,353 --> 01:03:38,733
Not the way you do it,
like you're out for revenge or something.

939
01:03:38,858 --> 01:03:41,612
Are you finished now?

940
01:03:41,737 --> 01:03:43,238
Yes.

941
01:03:43,363 --> 01:03:45,740
Can I say something?

942
01:03:45,865 --> 01:03:47,492
Yes.

943
01:03:50,161 --> 01:03:52,832
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

944
01:04:03,842 --> 01:04:06,137
Don't say a word!

945
01:04:09,806 --> 01:04:12,935
It's a monkey, a monkey.
Monkey see, monkey do.

946
01:04:13,060 --> 01:04:16,522
- It's an ape. Going ape.
- It's a baby!

947
01:04:16,647 --> 01:04:19,983
- Planet ofthe Apes!
- She said baby! Try Planet ofthe Dopes.

948
01:04:20,109 --> 01:04:23,946
- It doesn't look like a baby.
- Big mouth. Jagger as a baby.

949
01:04:24,071 --> 01:04:26,658
- Baby ape!
- Stop with the apes.

950
01:04:26,783 --> 01:04:29,994
- Baby's breath.
- Rosemary's Baby's mouth?

951
01:04:30,120 --> 01:04:32,621
- "Won't You Come Home, Bill Baby?"
- Kiss the baby!

952
01:04:32,746 --> 01:04:37,293
- "Melancholy Baby's Mouth"!
- Baby fish... Baby-fish mouth!

953
01:04:38,210 --> 01:04:40,130
- 1 5 seconds.
- A big mouth.

954
01:04:40,255 --> 01:04:42,257
- Baby boom!
- Baby...

955
01:04:42,381 --> 01:04:45,009
Draw something resembling anything!

956
01:04:45,135 --> 01:04:48,722
- Crying baby. Kiss the baby.
- Baby spitting up... Exorcist Baby!

957
01:04:48,972 --> 01:04:52,768
- "Yes Sir, That's My Baby".
- "No sir, don't mean maybe."

958
01:04:52,892 --> 01:04:55,686
- That's it. Time's up.
- Baby talk.

959
01:04:55,812 --> 01:04:59,191
Baby talk? What's that?
That's not a saying.

960
01:04:59,316 --> 01:05:03,319
But "baby-fish mouth" is sweeping
the nation! I hear them talking!

961
01:05:03,445 --> 01:05:05,948
Final score. Our team: 1 10.

962
01:05:06,073 --> 01:05:08,116
You guys: 60.

963
01:05:08,241 --> 01:05:11,370
- Ouch. Fix! Definitely a fix.
- Pathetic.

964
01:05:11,871 --> 01:05:16,833
- I can't draw.
- That's a baby, and it's clearly talking.

965
01:05:16,958 --> 01:05:18,793
You're wonderful.

966
01:05:18,918 --> 01:05:21,797
- Who wants coffee?
- I do, and I love you.

967
01:05:21,922 --> 01:05:24,799
- D'you have tea?
- lndustrial strength.

968
01:05:24,925 --> 01:05:28,387
- I'll help you. Decaf?
- Yeah.

969
01:05:29,221 --> 01:05:31,181
- Three.
- Yes, please.

970
01:05:31,305 --> 01:05:34,894
- Where's the bathroom?
- Through that door, down the hall.

971
01:05:41,442 --> 01:05:43,320
Never looked like a baby to me.

972
01:05:43,445 --> 01:05:44,946
- Which part?
- All of it.

973
01:05:45,072 --> 01:05:48,449
- You were gonna show me a book cover.
- Yeah, it's in the den.

974
01:05:48,574 --> 01:05:52,829
Julian, help yourself.
Have some more wine, whatever, OK?

975
01:05:52,952 --> 01:05:55,207
I like saying den. Got a nice ring to it.

976
01:05:55,749 --> 01:05:58,585
Emily's a little young for Harry,
don't you think?

977
01:05:58,710 --> 01:06:01,504
Well, she's young,
but look what she's done.

978
01:06:01,629 --> 01:06:04,006
What has she done? She makes desserts.

979
01:06:04,215 --> 01:06:08,512
- Does Julian seem a little stuffy to you?
- He's a good guy. You should talk to him.

980
01:06:08,637 --> 01:06:10,055
He's too tall to talk to.

981
01:06:10,179 --> 01:06:13,307
She makes 3,500
chocolate-mousse pies a week.

982
01:06:14,726 --> 01:06:16,978
Emily is "Aunt Emily"?

983
01:06:17,104 --> 01:06:19,564
He took us to a Met game last week.
It was great.

984
01:06:19,689 --> 01:06:24,193
- You all went to a Met game together?
- Yeah, but it was a last-minute thing.

985
01:06:24,318 --> 01:06:25,737
But Sally hates baseball.

986
01:06:25,862 --> 01:06:28,115
Harry doesn't even like sweets.

987
01:06:28,240 --> 01:06:30,784
Julian is great.

988
01:06:30,909 --> 01:06:32,911
I know. He's a grown-up.

989
01:06:33,036 --> 01:06:36,457
- Emily is terrific.
- Yeah. But when I asked where she was

990
01:06:36,582 --> 01:06:40,169
when Kennedy was shot,
she said "Ted Kennedy was shot?"

991
01:06:52,099 --> 01:06:54,182
- Hello?
- Are you alone?

992
01:06:54,307 --> 01:06:56,394
Yeah. I was just finishing a book.

993
01:06:56,518 --> 01:06:59,397
- Could you come over?
- What's the matter?

994
01:06:59,813 --> 01:07:02,483
- He's getting married.
- Who?

995
01:07:03,277 --> 01:07:04,777
Joe!

996
01:07:05,279 --> 01:07:08,363
I'll be right there.

997
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:14,204
- Hi.
- Are you all right?

998
01:07:16,664 --> 01:07:18,916
Come on in.

999
01:07:21,628 --> 01:07:24,714
- I'm sorry to call you so late.
- It's all right.

1000
01:07:26,216 --> 01:07:28,342
- I need a Kleenex!
- OK.

1001
01:07:28,469 --> 01:07:29,970
OK. OK.

1002
01:07:30,510 --> 01:07:33,347
He just called me up,
"Wanted to see how you were",

1003
01:07:33,473 --> 01:07:35,893
"Fine. How are you?" "Fine."

1004
01:07:36,018 --> 01:07:39,645
His secretary's on vacation,
everything's all backed up.

1005
01:07:39,771 --> 01:07:43,525
He's got a big case in Newark,
blah, blah, blah.

1006
01:07:44,651 --> 01:07:48,947
And I'm sitting on the phone thinking
"I am over him, I really am over him,

1007
01:07:49,073 --> 01:07:53,159
I can't believe I was ever
remotely interested in any of this."

1008
01:07:54,203 --> 01:07:57,499
And then he said "I have some news."

1009
01:08:01,335 --> 01:08:05,673
She works in his office. She's a paralegal.
Her name is Kimberly.

1010
01:08:07,551 --> 01:08:09,594
He just met her!

1011
01:08:09,719 --> 01:08:15,225
She's supposed to be his
transitional person, not "the one"!

1012
01:08:20,647 --> 01:08:25,401
All this time, I've been saying
that he didn't wanna get married.

1013
01:08:26,945 --> 01:08:29,114
But the truth is,

1014
01:08:29,239 --> 01:08:31,907
he didn't wanna marry me.

1015
01:08:35,036 --> 01:08:37,288
He didn't love me.

1016
01:08:41,334 --> 01:08:44,004
If you could take him back
right now, would you?

1017
01:08:45,880 --> 01:08:47,924
No!

1018
01:08:48,049 --> 01:08:50,885
But why didn't he wanna marry me?

1019
01:08:51,678 --> 01:08:54,514
- What's the matter with me?
- Nothing.

1020
01:08:54,640 --> 01:08:56,975
- I'm difficult.
- You're challenging.

1021
01:08:57,101 --> 01:09:00,645
- I'm too structured. I'm closed off.
- But in a good way.

1022
01:09:01,688 --> 01:09:05,068
No, no, no. I drove him away.

1023
01:09:07,319 --> 01:09:09,571
And I'm gonna be 40!

1024
01:09:10,698 --> 01:09:12,241
When?

1025
01:09:12,365 --> 01:09:14,703
- Some day.
- ln eight years.

1026
01:09:15,203 --> 01:09:20,374
But it's there! It's just sitting there
like this big dead end.

1027
01:09:21,500 --> 01:09:26,923
And it's not the same for men. Charlie
Chaplin had babies when he was 73.

1028
01:09:27,048 --> 01:09:29,258
Yeah, but he was too old to pick 'em up.

1029
01:09:35,598 --> 01:09:37,809
Come here. Come here.

1030
01:09:37,934 --> 01:09:39,811
It's gonna be OK.

1031
01:09:39,936 --> 01:09:42,272
It's gonna be fine, you'll see.

1032
01:09:43,398 --> 01:09:46,525
Go ahead. It's not one
of my favourites anyway.

1033
01:09:48,403 --> 01:09:50,864
It's gonna be OK. Hm?

1034
01:09:56,827 --> 01:09:58,998
Hm? OK?

1035
01:09:59,122 --> 01:10:00,957
OK.

1036
01:10:03,919 --> 01:10:07,757
- I'll make some tea.
- Harry, could you hold me a little longer?

1037
01:10:07,881 --> 01:10:09,758
Oh, sure.

1038
01:10:15,888 --> 01:10:18,225
OK? Hm?

1039
01:10:50,216 --> 01:10:52,135
Are you comfortable?

1040
01:10:52,260 --> 01:10:54,095
Sure.

1041
01:10:58,933 --> 01:11:02,937
- D'you want something to drink?
- No, I'm OK.

1042
01:11:04,147 --> 01:11:07,900
I'm going to get up for some water,
so it's really no trouble.

1043
01:11:08,025 --> 01:11:10,069
OK. Water.

1044
01:12:05,502 --> 01:12:10,256
You have all your video tapes
alphabetised and on index cards.

1045
01:12:10,380 --> 01:12:11,799
Thank you.

1046
01:12:12,091 --> 01:12:15,595
- D'you wanna watch something?
- No. Not unless you do.

1047
01:12:16,137 --> 01:12:18,263
No. That's OK.

1048
01:12:32,319 --> 01:12:35,866
- D'you wanna go to sleep?
- OK.

1049
01:13:10,192 --> 01:13:12,571
Where are you going?

1050
01:13:12,696 --> 01:13:15,157
I gotta go.

1051
01:13:16,323 --> 01:13:19,578
Gotta go home, change my clothes
and go to work. And so do you.

1052
01:13:19,703 --> 01:13:23,497
But after work I'd like to take you
out to dinner, if you're free. You free?

1053
01:13:23,622 --> 01:13:26,168
- Yes.
- Fine. I'll call you later.

1054
01:13:26,834 --> 01:13:29,086
- Fine.
- Fine.

1055
01:13:48,230 --> 01:13:50,275
- Yours!
- Hello.

1056
01:13:50,400 --> 01:13:52,694
- Sorry to call so early.
- Are you all right?

1057
01:13:52,820 --> 01:13:56,239
No one I know would call at this hour.

1058
01:13:56,364 --> 01:13:58,408
- No one I know would call.
- It's awful.

1059
01:13:58,533 --> 01:14:00,368
- I need to talk.
- What happened?

1060
01:14:00,494 --> 01:14:02,496
- Harry came over.
- I went to Sally's.

1061
01:14:02,621 --> 01:14:05,374
- I was upset Joe was marrying.
- One thing led to another.

1062
01:14:05,500 --> 01:14:08,794
- Before I knew it we were kissing. Then...
- ..we did it.

1063
01:14:08,919 --> 01:14:10,087
They did it!

1064
01:14:10,253 --> 01:14:12,297
- That's great!
- We prayed for it.

1065
01:14:12,422 --> 01:14:15,135
- You shoulda done it before.
- We said you should do it.

1066
01:14:15,260 --> 01:14:17,886
- You belong together.
- You killed two birds with one stone.

1067
01:14:18,012 --> 01:14:20,639
- Two wrongs make a right.
- How was it?

1068
01:14:20,765 --> 01:14:22,308
- During part was good,...
- Good,...

1069
01:14:22,433 --> 01:14:24,476
- ..then I felt suffocated.
- ..then it wasn't.

1070
01:14:24,601 --> 01:14:25,852
- Sorry.
- The worst.

1071
01:14:25,978 --> 01:14:27,355
- I had to go.
- He left.

1072
01:14:27,480 --> 01:14:29,190
- I feel bad.
- I'm embarrassed.

1073
01:14:29,316 --> 01:14:30,566
I don't blame you.

1074
01:14:30,690 --> 01:14:32,692
- I feel ill.
- I'm catching a cold.

1075
01:14:32,818 --> 01:14:34,487
Look, it didn't work out.

1076
01:14:34,612 --> 01:14:38,116
Never sleep with anyone
when you find out your ex is marrying.

1077
01:14:38,241 --> 01:14:40,118
- Who's talking?
- Is that Jess?

1078
01:14:40,243 --> 01:14:42,788
- It's Jane Fonda on the VCR.
- It's Bryant Gumbel.

1079
01:14:42,913 --> 01:14:44,498
Wanna have breakfast?

1080
01:14:44,623 --> 01:14:46,706
- No, I'm not up to it.
- I feel too awful.

1081
01:14:46,833 --> 01:14:48,751
- Good.
- I mean, it's so early.

1082
01:14:48,876 --> 01:14:51,338
- But call me later.
- I'll call you later.

1083
01:14:51,463 --> 01:14:52,714
- OK. Bye.
- Bye.

1084
01:14:52,840 --> 01:14:54,882
- Bye.
- Bye.

1085
01:14:56,134 --> 01:14:58,803
- God!
- I know.

1086
01:14:59,888 --> 01:15:02,974
Tell me I'll never have to be
out there again.

1087
01:15:06,269 --> 01:15:09,146
You will never have to be out there again.

1088
01:15:12,485 --> 01:15:14,862
I'll just say we made a mistake.

1089
01:15:15,695 --> 01:15:18,490
Sally, it was a mistake.

1090
01:15:20,868 --> 01:15:23,328
I just hope I get to say it first.

1091
01:15:24,246 --> 01:15:26,874
I hope she says it before I do.

1092
01:15:29,836 --> 01:15:33,590
- It was a mistake.
- I am so relieved that you think so, too.

1093
01:15:35,300 --> 01:15:38,177
I'm not saying last night wasn't great.

1094
01:15:38,302 --> 01:15:41,263
- It was!
- Yes, it was!

1095
01:15:42,307 --> 01:15:45,809
- We just never should have done it.
- I couldn't agree more.

1096
01:15:46,186 --> 01:15:49,397
- I am so relieved!
- Great.

1097
01:15:49,522 --> 01:15:51,566
Yeah.

1098
01:15:53,817 --> 01:15:55,862
Two mixed green salads.

1099
01:16:25,266 --> 01:16:30,314
It is so nice when you can sit
with someone and not have to talk. Hm?

1100
01:16:34,276 --> 01:16:36,737
Most of the time,
you go to bed with someone,

1101
01:16:36,904 --> 01:16:40,991
then she tells you all her stories,
you tell her all your stories.

1102
01:16:41,118 --> 01:16:44,871
But with Sally and me,
we'd already heard each other's stories.

1103
01:16:45,037 --> 01:16:49,082
So once we went to bed, we didn't know
what we were supposed to do. You know?

1104
01:16:49,208 --> 01:16:51,419
Sure, Harry.

1105
01:16:52,087 --> 01:16:53,796
I don't know.

1106
01:16:53,921 --> 01:16:59,510
Maybe you get to a point in a relationship
where it's too late to have sex. You know?

1107
01:17:09,103 --> 01:17:11,480
Is Harry bringing anyone to the wedding?

1108
01:17:11,647 --> 01:17:13,693
I don't think so.

1109
01:17:15,068 --> 01:17:20,574
- Is he seeing anyone?
- He was seeing this anthropologist, but...

1110
01:17:21,532 --> 01:17:25,746
- What does she look like?
- Thin, pretty, big tits.

1111
01:17:25,912 --> 01:17:28,415
Your basic nightmare.

1112
01:17:32,126 --> 01:17:34,337
What d'ya think?

1113
01:17:35,840 --> 01:17:37,633
Marie...

1114
01:17:38,383 --> 01:17:40,177
Tell the truth.

1115
01:17:41,720 --> 01:17:44,181
It's just beautiful.

1116
01:18:15,797 --> 01:18:21,553
We are gathered here today to celebrate
the marriage of Marie and Jess.

1117
01:18:22,346 --> 01:18:25,515
And to consecrate
their vows of matrimony.

1118
01:18:25,681 --> 01:18:29,185
The vows they will take join their lives.

1119
01:18:29,310 --> 01:18:34,398
The wine they will share
binds all their hopes together.

1120
01:18:34,565 --> 01:18:36,859
And by the rings they will wear,

1121
01:18:37,027 --> 01:18:41,906
they will be known to all
as husband and wife.

1122
01:18:52,376 --> 01:18:56,004
I've never seen her so happy.
She's a different person.

1123
01:18:56,171 --> 01:19:00,883
Oh, yeah, she is. It's great,
but what're we gonna do about you?

1124
01:19:01,050 --> 01:19:03,429
- Me?
- Hon, you wanna dance?

1125
01:19:03,595 --> 01:19:06,015
- Oh, yeah! Yeah, I do.
- Excuse us.

1126
01:19:09,518 --> 01:19:12,187
- Hi.
- Hello.

1127
01:19:15,857 --> 01:19:18,945
- Nice ceremony.
- Beautiful.

1128
01:19:21,573 --> 01:19:26,784
Boy, the holidays are rough! Every year I
try to get from Thanksgiving to New Year.

1129
01:19:26,952 --> 01:19:29,289
A lot of suicides.

1130
01:19:30,416 --> 01:19:33,500
- Would you like a pea pod with shrimp?
- Thank you.

1131
01:19:34,793 --> 01:19:37,546
- How've you been?
- Fine.

1132
01:19:37,671 --> 01:19:39,299
- Seeing anybody?
- Harry.

1133
01:19:39,466 --> 01:19:41,426
- What?
- I don't wanna talk about this.

1134
01:19:41,593 --> 01:19:45,138
- Why not?
- I don't want to talk about it.

1135
01:19:45,306 --> 01:19:49,601
Why can't we get past this? Are we
gonna carry this thing around for ever?

1136
01:19:49,726 --> 01:19:54,105
- Forever? It just happened!
- It happened three weeks ago.

1137
01:19:54,272 --> 01:19:58,193
You know how a year to a person
is like seven years to a dog?

1138
01:19:58,360 --> 01:20:00,070
Yes!

1139
01:20:02,322 --> 01:20:05,242
Is one of us supposed to be a dog
in this scenario?

1140
01:20:05,658 --> 01:20:07,994
- Yes.
- Who is the dog?

1141
01:20:08,203 --> 01:20:11,372
- You are.
- I am! I am the dog!

1142
01:20:11,538 --> 01:20:13,959
I am the dog! I...

1143
01:20:20,049 --> 01:20:25,179
I don't see that. You are the dog. You act
like what happened didn't mean anything.

1144
01:20:25,346 --> 01:20:28,390
No, I don't, but why
does it have to mean everything?

1145
01:20:28,557 --> 01:20:33,980
Because it does! You know it better than
anyone, cos after it happens you walk out!

1146
01:20:34,106 --> 01:20:37,066
- I didn't walk out.
- Sprinted is more like it.

1147
01:20:37,234 --> 01:20:40,569
- We both agreed it was a mistake.
- The worst mistake I ever made!

1148
01:20:42,488 --> 01:20:44,365
- What do you want from me?
- Nothing!

1149
01:20:44,532 --> 01:20:50,413
Fine! But let's just get one thing straight. I
did not go over there to make love to you.

1150
01:20:50,580 --> 01:20:54,583
But you looked at me with these weepy
eyes: "Don't go home. Hold me, Harry."

1151
01:20:54,750 --> 01:20:58,588
- What was I supposed to do?
- Are you saying you took pity on me?

1152
01:20:58,756 --> 01:21:01,424
- No! I was...
- Fuck you!

1153
01:21:04,928 --> 01:21:08,055
Everybody, could I have
your attention, please?

1154
01:21:08,223 --> 01:21:12,436
I'd like to propose a toast,
to Harry and Sally.

1155
01:21:12,602 --> 01:21:14,438
To Harry and Sally.

1156
01:21:14,604 --> 01:21:19,026
If Marie or I had found either of them
remotely attractive,

1157
01:21:19,192 --> 01:21:22,280
we would not be here today.

1158
01:21:31,204 --> 01:21:35,793
Have yourselfa merry little Christmas

1159
01:21:36,794 --> 01:21:39,838
Let yourselfbe light

1160
01:21:41,132 --> 01:21:47,179
From now on
our troubles will be out ofsight

1161
01:21:51,601 --> 01:21:56,022
Have yourself a merry little Christmas

1162
01:21:56,898 --> 01:22:00,484
Make the yuletide gay

1163
01:22:01,234 --> 01:22:07,242
From now on
our troubles will be miles away

1164
01:22:08,992 --> 01:22:11,328
Hi, it's me. It's the holiday season,

1165
01:22:11,453 --> 01:22:15,000
and I thought I'd remind you
that it's the season of forgiveness.

1166
01:22:15,375 --> 01:22:19,796
And, although it's not widely known,
it is also the season of grovelling.

1167
01:22:20,213 --> 01:22:22,465
So, if you felt like calling me back,

1168
01:22:22,841 --> 01:22:26,804
I'd be more than happy to do
the traditional Christmas grovelling.

1169
01:22:26,929 --> 01:22:28,764
Give me a call.

1170
01:22:44,822 --> 01:22:47,699
Hi, I'm not home. I'll call you right back.

1171
01:22:47,825 --> 01:22:51,955
If you're there, please pick up.
I really wanna talk to you.

1172
01:22:54,456 --> 01:22:59,129
The fact you're not answering leads me
to believe you're either, A: not at home,

1173
01:22:59,255 --> 01:23:02,548
B: home, but don't wanna talk to me, or C:

1174
01:23:02,673 --> 01:23:07,303
home, desperately wanna talk to me,
but trapped under something heavy.

1175
01:23:07,429 --> 01:23:10,515
If it's either A or C, please call me back.

1176
01:23:12,809 --> 01:23:17,062
Obviously she doesn't wanna talk to me.
What do I have to do, be hit on the head?

1177
01:23:17,188 --> 01:23:20,899
If she wants to call, she'll call.
I'm through actin' like a schmuck.

1178
01:23:21,402 --> 01:23:24,736
If you're feeling sad and lonely

1179
01:23:24,863 --> 01:23:27,866
There's a service I can render

1180
01:23:28,199 --> 01:23:31,034
Tell the one who digs you only

1181
01:23:31,160 --> 01:23:34,540
I can be so warm and tender

1182
01:23:34,664 --> 01:23:36,125
Call me

1183
01:23:36,249 --> 01:23:39,878
Maybe it's late tojust call me

1184
01:23:40,003 --> 01:23:43,382
Don't be afraid to just phone moi

1185
01:23:43,632 --> 01:23:47,552
Call me and I'll be around

1186
01:23:47,927 --> 01:23:49,054
Give me a call.

1187
01:23:49,180 --> 01:23:51,807
- Hi, Harry.
- Hello. Hi! Hi!

1188
01:23:51,932 --> 01:23:54,643
I didn't know that you would...
That you were there.

1189
01:23:54,852 --> 01:23:57,688
- What're you doing?
- I was just on my way out.

1190
01:23:57,813 --> 01:24:00,274
Where you going?

1191
01:24:00,399 --> 01:24:03,026
- What do you want, Harry?
- Nothing. Nothing.

1192
01:24:03,151 --> 01:24:06,614
I... I just called to say I'm sorry.

1193
01:24:08,364 --> 01:24:10,201
OK.

1194
01:24:17,208 --> 01:24:20,711
- I gotta go.
- Wait a second. Wait... wait a second.

1195
01:24:20,836 --> 01:24:25,298
What're you doin' for New Year's? Going
to the Tylers' party? I don't have a date.

1196
01:24:25,423 --> 01:24:31,514
If you don't have a date, we always said
we could be together for New Year's and...

1197
01:24:31,640 --> 01:24:35,476
I can't do this any more.
I am not your consolation prize.

1198
01:24:35,601 --> 01:24:37,728
Goodbye.

1199
01:24:46,112 --> 01:24:51,535
And here we are once again. The 16th
annual "New Year's Rockin' Eve",

1200
01:24:51,660 --> 01:24:53,369
coming to you live...

1201
01:24:53,787 --> 01:24:57,457
What's so bad about this?
You got Dick Clark - tradition.

1202
01:24:57,581 --> 01:25:00,377
You got Mallomars,
the greatest cookie of all time.

1203
01:25:00,501 --> 01:25:05,216
And you're about to give the Knicks
their first championship since 1973.

1204
01:25:22,733 --> 01:25:25,445
I don't know why I let you drag me to this.

1205
01:25:29,532 --> 01:25:34,203
This is much better. Fresh air,
I have the streets all to myself.

1206
01:25:34,328 --> 01:25:38,082
Who needs to be at a big, crowded party,
pretending to have a good time?

1207
01:25:38,207 --> 01:25:42,003
Plus, this is the perfect time
to catch up on my window-shopping.

1208
01:25:42,335 --> 01:25:43,755
This is good.

1209
01:25:55,725 --> 01:25:58,812
So the guy says "Read the card."

1210
01:26:08,738 --> 01:26:11,825
- I'm going home.
- You'll never get a taxi.

1211
01:26:12,826 --> 01:26:14,035
Oh, God!

1212
01:26:41,898 --> 01:26:44,484
You realise that
we could never be friends.

1213
01:26:44,608 --> 01:26:46,944
- Why not?
- What I'm saying is,

1214
01:26:47,069 --> 01:26:50,739
men and women can't be friends,
cos the sex part always gets in the way.

1215
01:26:50,864 --> 01:26:52,324
That's not true!

1216
01:26:52,449 --> 01:26:54,953
No man can be friends
with a woman he finds attractive.

1217
01:26:55,077 --> 01:26:59,124
- He always wants to have sex with her.
- What if they don't wanna have sex?

1218
01:26:59,248 --> 01:27:02,960
Doesn't matter. The sex thing is already
out there, so the friendship is doomed.

1219
01:27:03,085 --> 01:27:05,672
And that is the end ofthe story.

1220
01:27:05,797 --> 01:27:08,591
- I guess we're not gonna be friends then.
- Guess not.

1221
01:27:08,716 --> 01:27:10,343
That's too bad.

1222
01:27:10,468 --> 01:27:13,471
You were the only person
that I knew in New York.

1223
01:27:17,392 --> 01:27:22,272
It had to be you

1224
01:27:26,359 --> 01:27:29,613
It had to be you

1225
01:27:33,741 --> 01:27:36,704
I wandered around

1226
01:27:36,828 --> 01:27:40,916
And I finally found

1227
01:27:41,041 --> 01:27:44,795
The somebody who

1228
01:27:48,131 --> 01:27:53,845
Could make me be true

1229
01:27:54,388 --> 01:27:58,851
And could make me be blue...

1230
01:28:00,228 --> 01:28:03,314
- I'm going.
- It's almost midnight!

1231
01:28:03,731 --> 01:28:07,443
- The thought of not kissing somebody...
- I'll kiss you.

1232
01:28:08,569 --> 01:28:11,071
Hey, taxi! Taxi!

1233
01:28:11,198 --> 01:28:13,200
Taxi!

1234
01:28:13,325 --> 01:28:15,160
Shit.

1235
01:28:16,035 --> 01:28:20,623
- Come on, stay. Please.
- Thanks, Jess. I just... I have to go.

1236
01:28:20,749 --> 01:28:23,502
- Wait two minutes.
- I'll call you tomorrow.

1237
01:28:23,627 --> 01:28:28,799
Might never be mean

1238
01:28:31,008 --> 01:28:34,806
Might never be cross

1239
01:28:34,930 --> 01:28:37,975
Or try to be boss

1240
01:28:39,058 --> 01:28:43,605
But they wouldn't do

1241
01:28:45,857 --> 01:28:49,945
For nobody else

1242
01:28:50,070 --> 01:28:53,489
Gave me a thrill

1243
01:28:54,573 --> 01:28:57,203
With all your faults

1244
01:28:57,328 --> 01:29:00,373
I love you still

1245
01:29:00,497 --> 01:29:03,208
It had to be you...

1246
01:29:03,332 --> 01:29:07,255
I've been doin' a lot of thinkin',
and the thing is, I love you.

1247
01:29:07,381 --> 01:29:10,133
- What?
- I love you.

1248
01:29:10,507 --> 01:29:14,846
- How d'you expect me to respond to this?
- How about you love me, too?

1249
01:29:15,346 --> 01:29:19,392
- How about I'm leaving?
- Doesn't what I said mean anything?

1250
01:29:19,517 --> 01:29:23,478
Sorry, Harry. I know it's New Year's Eve,
I know you're feeling lonely,

1251
01:29:23,603 --> 01:29:28,902
but you just can't show up, say you love
me and expect that to make it all right.

1252
01:29:29,027 --> 01:29:32,530
- It doesn't work this way.
- Well, how does it work?

1253
01:29:32,655 --> 01:29:36,451
- I don't know, but not this way.
- Then how about this way?

1254
01:29:36,576 --> 01:29:39,119
I love that you get cold when it's 71° out.

1255
01:29:39,244 --> 01:29:42,039
I love that it takes you 1 1/2 hours
to order a sandwich.

1256
01:29:42,165 --> 01:29:45,543
I love that you get a crinkle here
when you look at me like I'm nuts.

1257
01:29:45,668 --> 01:29:49,505
I love that after I spend a day with you
I smell your perfume on my clothes.

1258
01:29:49,630 --> 01:29:54,260
And I love that you are the last person I
wanna talk to before I go to sleep at night.

1259
01:29:54,385 --> 01:29:58,182
And it's not because I'm lonely
or because it's New Year's Eve.

1260
01:29:58,307 --> 01:30:02,519
I came cos when you realise you wanna
spend the rest of your life with someone

1261
01:30:02,644 --> 01:30:06,064
you want the rest of your life
to start as soon as possible.

1262
01:30:09,400 --> 01:30:11,444
You see?

1263
01:30:12,237 --> 01:30:14,282
That is just like you, Harry.

1264
01:30:14,407 --> 01:30:18,994
You say things like that and you make it
impossible for me to hate you!

1265
01:30:19,912 --> 01:30:22,873
And I hate you, Harry.

1266
01:30:23,832 --> 01:30:26,127
I really hate you.

1267
01:30:29,881 --> 01:30:31,924
I hate you.

1268
01:30:49,234 --> 01:30:52,487
What does this song mean?
My whole life, I don't know.

1269
01:30:52,612 --> 01:30:56,198
"Should auld acquaintance be forgot" -
should we forget old acquaintances?

1270
01:30:56,323 --> 01:30:58,660
Or if we forget them,
should we remember them?

1271
01:30:58,785 --> 01:31:01,579
Which is not possible
cos we already forgot 'em!

1272
01:31:01,704 --> 01:31:06,418
Maybe it just means we should remember
that we forgot them, or something.

1273
01:31:08,879 --> 01:31:11,882
Anyway, it's about old friends.

1274
01:31:18,638 --> 01:31:21,183
The first time we met
we hated each other.

1275
01:31:21,308 --> 01:31:26,146
No, I hated you. The second time we met,
you didn't even remember me.

1276
01:31:26,272 --> 01:31:28,606
I did, too! I remembered you.

1277
01:31:28,731 --> 01:31:31,277
The third time we met
we became friends.

1278
01:31:31,402 --> 01:31:34,821
- We were friends for a long time.
- And then we weren't.

1279
01:31:34,947 --> 01:31:37,324
And then we fell in love.

1280
01:31:37,741 --> 01:31:41,328
- Three months later we got married.
- It only took three months.

1281
01:31:41,454 --> 01:31:43,289
12 years and three months.

1282
01:31:43,414 --> 01:31:47,960
- We had a really wonderful wedding.
- It really was a beautiful wedding.

1283
01:31:48,085 --> 01:31:52,340
- We had this enormous coconut cake.
- Huge coconut cake with the tiers.

1284
01:31:52,465 --> 01:31:55,510
And there was this very rich
chocolate sauce on the side.

1285
01:31:55,635 --> 01:31:59,097
Right. Cos not everybody likes it
on the cake cos it makes it soggy.

1286
01:31:59,222 --> 01:32:03,933
Particularly, the coconut soaks up a lot,
so it's important to keep it on the side.

1287
01:32:04,602 --> 01:32:06,770
It had to be you

1288
01:32:06,938 --> 01:32:09,439
It had to be you

1289
01:32:09,607 --> 01:32:12,359
I wandered around and finally found

1290
01:32:12,527 --> 01:32:14,694
The somebody who

1291
01:32:14,862 --> 01:32:17,322
Could make me be true

1292
01:32:17,490 --> 01:32:20,116
Could make me be blue

1293
01:32:20,284 --> 01:32:22,911
And even be glad just to be sad

1294
01:32:23,079 --> 01:32:25,622
Thinking of you

1295
01:32:26,457 --> 01:32:28,959
But you say ee-ther, and I say either

1296
01:32:29,126 --> 01:32:31,503
You say nee-ther, I say neither

1297
01:32:31,671 --> 01:32:34,089
Ee-ther, either
Nee-ther, neither

1298
01:32:34,257 --> 01:32:36,967
Let's call the whole thing off

1299
01:32:37,134 --> 01:32:39,469
You say potato and I say pot-ahto

1300
01:32:39,637 --> 01:32:42,138
You say tomato, I say tom-ahto

1301
01:32:42,306 --> 01:32:44,808
Potato, pot-ahto
Tomato, tom-ahto

1302
01:32:44,976 --> 01:32:47,435
Let's call the whole thing off

1303
01:32:47,603 --> 01:32:52,440
Oh, if we call the whole thing off,
then we must part

1304
01:32:52,608 --> 01:32:58,071
And though if we ever part,
that would break my heart

1305
01:32:58,239 --> 01:33:00,574
You say laughter, I say larf-ter

1306
01:33:00,741 --> 01:33:03,034
You say after, I say arf-ter

1307
01:33:03,202 --> 01:33:05,203
Before we know we need each other

1308
01:33:05,371 --> 01:33:08,498
So we'd better call, call it off, oh!

1309
01:33:08,666 --> 01:33:10,500
- Let's
- Call it off!

1310
01:33:10,668 --> 01:33:13,128
- Oh, let's
- Call it off!

1311
01:33:13,296 --> 01:33:15,672
- Baby, let's
- Call it off!

1312
01:33:15,840 --> 01:33:19,092
Sugar, why don't we

1313
01:33:19,260 --> 01:33:22,596
Let's, let's call the whole thing

1314
01:34:04,805 --> 01:34:10,060
They're writing songs of love,
but not for me

1315
01:34:10,227 --> 01:34:14,981
A lucky star's above,
but not for me

1316
01:34:15,149 --> 01:34:20,320
With love to lead the way,
I've found more clouds of gray

1317
01:34:20,488 --> 01:34:25,659
Than any Russian play could guarantee

1318
01:34:25,826 --> 01:34:30,830
I was a fool to fall
and get that way

1319
01:34:30,998 --> 01:34:32,832
Hi-ho alas

1320
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:36,211
And also lackaday

1321
01:34:36,379 --> 01:34:41,800
Although I can't dismiss
the memory of her kiss

1322
01:34:41,967 --> 01:34:45,136
I guess she's not

1323
01:34:45,304 --> 01:34:47,806
For

1324
01:34:47,973 --> 01:34:51,434
Me

1325
01:34:52,353 --> 01:34:57,774
It had to be you

1326
01:35:02,780 --> 01:35:05,615
For nobody else gave me a thrill

1327
01:35:05,783 --> 01:35:08,159
With all your faults, I love you still

1328
01:35:08,327 --> 01:35:10,912
It had to be you, wonderful you

1329
01:35:11,080 --> 01:35:13,331
It had to be you

1
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,300
<i>The oldest stories ever told,
are written in the stars.</i>

2
00:00:40,207 --> 00:00:46,007
<i>Stories of time before men and gods,
when Titans ruled the Earth.</i>

3
00:00:46,714 --> 00:00:51,914
<i>The Titans were powerful, but their
reign was ended by their own sons,</i>

4
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:57,519
<i>Zeus, Poseidon and Hades.</i>

5
00:00:58,727 --> 00:01:02,927
<i>Zeus convinced his brother
Hades to create a beast so strong</i>

6
00:01:02,932 --> 00:01:04,981
<i> that could defeat their parents.</i>

7
00:01:04,985 --> 00:01:11,034
<i>And from his own flesh,
Hades gave birth to an unspeakable horror.</i>

8
00:01:11,641 --> 00:01:14,141
<i>The Kraken.</i>

9
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:24,350
<i>Zeus became King of the heavens.</i>

10
00:01:24,356 --> 00:01:28,556
<i> Poseidon King of the seas.</i>

11
00:01:28,561 --> 00:01:31,759
<i>And Hades, tricked by Zeus,</i>

12
00:01:31,764 --> 00:01:37,663
<i> was left to rule the underworld
in darkness and in misery.</i>

13
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:45,070
<i>It was Zeus who created man,
and man's prayers fed the Gods' immortality.</i>

14
00:01:48,981 --> 00:01:52,881
<i>But in time, mankind grew restless.</i>

15
00:01:52,887 --> 00:01:58,986
<i>They begun to question the Gods
and finally rise up against them.</i>

16
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:09,500
<i>Into this world, a child was born.</i>

17
00:02:10,405 --> 00:02:14,105
<i>A boy who would change everything.</i>

18
00:02:50,348 --> 00:02:53,952
Perseus.

19
00:03:23,121 --> 00:03:25,890
What is it son?

20
00:03:25,928 --> 00:03:29,097
I will have a brother or a sister soon.

21
00:03:29,135 --> 00:03:31,871
You think we're gonna love this child

22
00:03:31,875 --> 00:03:34,844
differently to the way we love you...
But we won't.

23
00:03:35,849 --> 00:03:37,902
This child will be yours.

24
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:41,924
Me...I'm no one's son.

25
00:03:41,963 --> 00:03:45,267
I'm your father Perseus,
Marmara is your mother,

26
00:03:45,306 --> 00:03:49,040
and you'll always be our son.

27
00:03:49,079 --> 00:03:54,450
The bond between us,
is much more than flesh and bone.

28
00:03:54,491 --> 00:04:00,698
But the love we have for you,
it's that love that Gods and kings are fight over.

29
00:04:01,807 --> 00:04:03,576
I never understood the Gods,

30
00:04:03,612 --> 00:04:07,467
but even I don't question that
you're saved for a reason.

31
00:04:07,507 --> 00:04:14,328
And someday, that reason,
is gonna take you far away from here.

32
00:04:15,939 --> 00:04:18,742
But not tonight.

33
00:04:33,878 --> 00:04:36,781
TWELVE YEARS LATER

34
00:04:37,787 --> 00:04:40,456
Perseus!

35
00:04:40,493 --> 00:04:42,695
Getting frail, old man.

36
00:04:42,733 --> 00:04:45,802
Marmara!
Marmara!

37
00:04:50,014 --> 00:04:53,218
Another day...Nothing!

38
00:04:54,123 --> 00:04:56,391
Caught on the reef!

39
00:04:56,429 --> 00:04:59,833
To whom do we direct
our gratitude for this glorious bounty?

40
00:04:59,872 --> 00:05:03,205
- Spyros, please.
- Poseidon? Zeus?

41
00:05:03,244 --> 00:05:06,047
- Who do I thank Marmara?
- Thank the men who provoked them.

42
00:05:06,085 --> 00:05:09,471
They crushed my island,
they put a plague on yours.

43
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:12,826
They take from us what they want.
We are their slaves.

44
00:05:12,865 --> 00:05:16,069
The Gods gave us life.
For that, we should be thankful.

45
00:05:16,107 --> 00:05:19,241
I'm tired of being thankful for scraps.

46
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:23,985
I am a fisherman, Perseus is a fisherman,
and they've even taken that away from us.

47
00:05:24,025 --> 00:05:28,162
What we are.
And still they want us to love them anyway.

48
00:05:28,201 --> 00:05:32,805
One day, somebody's gonna have to make a stand.

49
00:05:32,845 --> 00:05:37,414
One day somebody's gonna have to say enough.

50
00:06:07,987 --> 00:06:11,591
Just like the day you came to me.

51
00:06:14,302 --> 00:06:17,705
The storm brought me right to you.

52
00:06:22,821 --> 00:06:27,427
I know you have questions, son.
I wish I had the answers.

53
00:06:32,242 --> 00:06:36,447
I have everything I need.
Right here.

54
00:06:39,057 --> 00:06:41,660
Good night, son.

55
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:01,203
Hold it steady!

56
00:07:01,207 --> 00:07:04,670
Tekla, take the wreath.
Fetch the wreath.

57
00:07:04,714 --> 00:07:08,418
The Statue of Zeus! Magnificent!

58
00:07:21,651 --> 00:07:24,455
Something isn't right.

59
00:07:24,493 --> 00:07:27,261
The soldiers, what are they doing?

60
00:07:36,685 --> 00:07:38,688
Hang on!

61
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:51,880
- Who are they?
- Soldiers from Argos.

62
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:55,723
- What have they done?
- They declared war.

63
00:07:55,762 --> 00:07:58,731
The war against the Gods.

64
00:08:19,781 --> 00:08:23,385
- Let's turn the boat around.
- No! Do nothing.

65
00:09:01,674 --> 00:09:04,177
Where is the boy?!

66
00:10:09,526 --> 00:10:12,394
Zeus, you must bring an end to this!

67
00:10:12,432 --> 00:10:16,286
They attacked our temples!
Now they dared to disgrace Zeus's image.

68
00:10:16,325 --> 00:10:20,145
- We could reach out to them.
- An accommodation could be made, a truce!

69
00:10:20,184 --> 00:10:22,552
No!

70
00:10:26,163 --> 00:10:31,570
I created them, and they reward my love with...
Defiance?!!

71
00:10:31,611 --> 00:10:34,444
There will be no truce!

72
00:10:34,482 --> 00:10:40,388
Finally, some rage from you.

73
00:10:42,599 --> 00:10:46,103
How long has it been?
How long brother?

74
00:10:46,142 --> 00:10:49,210
Since you've seen my face?

75
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:53,318
Hades.

76
00:10:58,333 --> 00:11:03,940
Endless years, I've watched from the Underworld.

77
00:11:03,981 --> 00:11:08,952
I saw your wrath tempered with love.

78
00:11:08,992 --> 00:11:11,594
You created them for one reason,

79
00:11:11,632 --> 00:11:16,669
so their prayers would fuel our immortality.

80
00:11:16,709 --> 00:11:19,445
But you love them too well.

81
00:11:19,483 --> 00:11:26,688
They grow strong, and now, I am forced to rise
because we are all threatened.

82
00:11:26,731 --> 00:11:32,703
- What do you want brother?
- Let me loose upon them.

83
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:38,917
They will pray again, and you will
bathed in their awe and fear.

84
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:40,992
And we will grow strong again.

85
00:11:41,029 --> 00:11:43,997
He belongs in the Underworld, not here.

86
00:11:44,035 --> 00:11:48,239
You do not tell me where I belong.

87
00:11:48,745 --> 00:11:52,014
You said it's love that feeds us,

88
00:11:52,053 --> 00:11:56,222
but you depend on their love.

89
00:11:56,261 --> 00:11:59,817
I've only learned to live on their fear...

90
00:11:59,856 --> 00:12:04,376
- Their pain.
- Zeus, our brother speaks the truth.

91
00:12:04,416 --> 00:12:07,784
Hear him.

92
00:12:11,597 --> 00:12:14,365
Go, do what you will.

93
00:12:14,403 --> 00:12:17,772
- Father, we need the mortals.
- No, Apollo.

94
00:12:17,811 --> 00:12:21,681
Hades is right.
Their insolence has a price.

95
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:25,624
Like children, they need to be reminded
of the order of things.

96
00:12:25,663 --> 00:12:28,196
Set an example brother.

97
00:12:28,234 --> 00:12:30,837
Turn them on each other.

98
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:33,843
And back into our arms.

99
00:13:00,307 --> 00:13:03,975
ARGOS

100
00:13:14,838 --> 00:13:20,144
- We are the last boat to come in?
- No captain, you are the only one.

101
00:13:20,951 --> 00:13:25,356
- Is he one of ours?
- No, we found him on the packs amongst our dead.

102
00:13:25,396 --> 00:13:30,067
- He was the only survivor.
- Let the palace figure out what to do with him.

103
00:13:33,078 --> 00:13:35,581
Go on.

104
00:13:40,596 --> 00:13:45,051
They gave us the corn in the fields,
and the sun and the sky. These are all the gifts given to us.

105
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:49,510
The gifts, they can be taken away. This would
be taken away, if we do not pay love to our gods.

106
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:53,519
If you do not wish to stay in our filth
and misery which we are brought upon ourselves.

107
00:13:53,559 --> 00:13:56,027
- Argos, as for we bid for the whip...
- Out of the way!

108
00:13:56,030 --> 00:13:59,570
The beauty and clarity of servitude.

109
00:13:59,637 --> 00:14:04,041
Man can not rule man, you fight the Gods
and you will be punished.

110
00:14:43,235 --> 00:14:47,840
- Is this all there is?
- We lost many men, Your Majesty.

111
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,648
But we have victory.

112
00:14:51,954 --> 00:14:57,160
To King Kepheus, to Queen Cassiopeia!

113
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:01,673
No ...

114
00:15:04,682 --> 00:15:07,185
To you.

115
00:15:07,689 --> 00:15:12,194
Our mighty legion, our heroes,
who'd dared to strike a blow

116
00:15:12,234 --> 00:15:15,503
at the heart of Zeus!

117
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:21,780
The temples are burning,
the statues have fallen.

118
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:24,223
We have starved them
of our prayers.

119
00:15:24,261 --> 00:15:27,747
Tonight, after a generation of struggle,

120
00:15:27,786 --> 00:15:31,314
the sun does not set
over the ocean.

121
00:15:31,353 --> 00:15:34,701
It sets on Olympus itself!

122
00:15:34,739 --> 00:15:38,052
A new era has begun.

123
00:15:38,091 --> 00:15:41,260
The era of Man!

124
00:15:42,366 --> 00:15:47,072
That frown doesn't suit you Andromeda.
Have something to drink, you'll feel more lively.

125
00:15:50,785 --> 00:15:52,987
Andromeda ...

126
00:16:02,712 --> 00:16:06,616
- What is your name?
- Perseus.

127
00:16:07,722 --> 00:16:10,726
Take this. Please, drink.

128
00:16:15,039 --> 00:16:17,692
- Hands off!
- Enough!

129
00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:20,348
Our daughter, the missionary.

130
00:16:22,055 --> 00:16:24,858
Have you seen
what's happening out there?

131
00:16:24,896 --> 00:16:27,664
Have you even
bothered to look?

132
00:16:27,702 --> 00:16:29,834
We serve as an inspiration.

133
00:16:29,871 --> 00:16:33,175
Hundreds of our men
have lost their lives.

134
00:16:33,214 --> 00:16:35,947
Yet we celebrate.

135
00:16:35,985 --> 00:16:39,189
You are provoking the Gods, and you act
like there won't be no consequence.

136
00:16:39,227 --> 00:16:42,161
And what do you want?
Should we be afraid?

137
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:45,854
Should we be trembling and
soiling ourselves in fear?

138
00:16:45,893 --> 00:16:49,512
The Gods need us.
They need our worship.

139
00:16:49,551 --> 00:16:52,184
What do we need from them?

140
00:16:52,222 --> 00:16:54,890
- Look at my daughter.
- Don't.

141
00:16:54,927 --> 00:16:58,096
What could be more
divine than her face?

142
00:16:58,135 --> 00:17:03,391
More beautiful than all the women of Greece,
more beautiful than Aphrodite herself.

143
00:17:03,432 --> 00:17:08,653
The Olympians should envy her.
We are the Gods now!

144
00:17:08,693 --> 00:17:11,161
My queen ...

145
00:17:55,462 --> 00:17:57,665
Interesting.

146
00:18:17,511 --> 00:18:21,816
You are specks of dust
underneath our fingernails.

147
00:18:21,856 --> 00:18:24,090
Your very breath is a gift from Olympus.

148
00:18:25,128 --> 00:18:29,132
You have insulted powers
beyond your comprehension.

149
00:18:29,173 --> 00:18:30,958
Who are you?

150
00:18:30,995 --> 00:18:34,746
I am Hades.

151
00:18:38,057 --> 00:18:40,461
Kneel.

152
00:18:47,177 --> 00:18:51,582
Not now Perseus,
you will have your chance.

153
00:18:56,699 --> 00:19:00,053
What do you know of beauty?

154
00:19:00,091 --> 00:19:03,410
What is more beautiful than death?

155
00:19:07,322 --> 00:19:11,226
Gaze upon me mortal queen.

156
00:19:20,251 --> 00:19:22,754
- Mother!
- Sit!

157
00:19:28,469 --> 00:19:33,375
In ten days, when the sun is eclipsed.

158
00:19:34,583 --> 00:19:38,152
I will unleash the Kraken.

159
00:19:38,191 --> 00:19:43,898
Argos will be swept from
the earth, and all of you with it.

160
00:19:45,508 --> 00:19:49,577
Unless, you sacrifice the princess,

161
00:19:49,616 --> 00:19:54,037
you so foolishly compared to the Gods.

162
00:19:54,077 --> 00:19:57,464
Only her blood will sate the Kraken

163
00:19:57,502 --> 00:20:02,241
and Zeus, who you have so offended.

164
00:20:06,353 --> 00:20:12,060
Choose your penance Argos,
destruction or sacrifice.

165
00:20:12,101 --> 00:20:15,037
This is the will of Zeus,

166
00:20:15,076 --> 00:20:19,979
the will of your father.

167
00:20:32,612 --> 00:20:35,415
There's a demigod in Argos.

168
00:20:37,223 --> 00:20:39,926
That's impossible.

169
00:20:40,129 --> 00:20:42,396
He's Yours.

170
00:20:42,433 --> 00:20:45,502
His name is Perseus.

171
00:20:45,541 --> 00:20:48,544
We could offer him sanctuary.

172
00:20:48,582 --> 00:20:51,516
Have I heard his prayers?

173
00:20:51,554 --> 00:20:54,923
The son knows no love for me.

174
00:20:54,962 --> 00:20:58,866
He is no different from any of the others
who have turned their backs on us.

175
00:20:59,172 --> 00:21:02,876
One of us, our demigod.
Speak!

176
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:07,585
- I am not a demigod.
- Who are you? why were you sent?

177
00:21:07,625 --> 00:21:10,493
I don't know.

178
00:21:17,111 --> 00:21:19,113
My advice against it Sira,
he's not to be trusted.

179
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:21,718
What did you have me do?!
Draco!

180
00:21:24,828 --> 00:21:27,531
Leave him.

181
00:21:31,042 --> 00:21:35,347
Is it possible?
If it's true, you are the son of Zeus.

182
00:21:36,254 --> 00:21:38,757
You can save us.

183
00:21:40,262 --> 00:21:44,833
- You must save us.
- I can't save you, I'm just a man.

184
00:21:44,873 --> 00:21:50,879
My Lord, as terrible as it is to out of the words
a sacrifice is the only way.

185
00:21:50,922 --> 00:21:54,307
- Don't even say a word!
- He's right.

186
00:21:54,345 --> 00:21:57,697
No one should have
to die for me.

187
00:21:57,736 --> 00:22:00,570
Let Perseus go.

188
00:22:00,608 --> 00:22:04,277
Sira, we need to get
the princess out of the city now.

189
00:22:04,316 --> 00:22:07,419
- We'll find a place to hide her.
- You can't hide her from Hades.

190
00:22:07,458 --> 00:22:10,627
So says the bastard son of a God.

191
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:19,946
My father...was killed by a God.

192
00:22:19,952 --> 00:22:24,321
My mother, sister ...

193
00:22:24,361 --> 00:22:28,866
Everyone I loved was killed by God.

194
00:22:28,906 --> 00:22:33,376
I mend nets, not whirled the sword.

195
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:46,004
Demigod, you have a visitor.

196
00:22:46,043 --> 00:22:49,012
She says, she knows you.

197
00:22:51,822 --> 00:22:54,926
My name is Io, Perseus.

198
00:22:55,430 --> 00:22:57,598
How do you know me?

199
00:22:57,635 --> 00:23:01,940
I watched you all your life.
I guided you to your family.

200
00:23:05,953 --> 00:23:09,157
- You are God?
- There are Gods and there are men.

201
00:23:09,196 --> 00:23:12,530
And there are those of us,
who are in between.

202
00:23:12,568 --> 00:23:17,274
Many years ago,
I refused a God's advance.

203
00:23:17,415 --> 00:23:20,083
I was cursed with agelessness.

204
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:21,852
So much of a curse.

205
00:23:21,889 --> 00:23:25,293
I've lived for years
watching my loved ones die.

206
00:23:25,298 --> 00:23:28,102
I imagine you're sympathetic to that plaint.

207
00:23:34,116 --> 00:23:36,719
Is it true?

208
00:23:38,025 --> 00:23:40,728
Am I the son of Zeus?

209
00:23:40,766 --> 00:23:43,199
Yes.

210
00:23:43,237 --> 00:23:48,342
The story of your birth, begun
with the rebellion of King Acrisius.

211
00:23:49,752 --> 00:23:55,057
<i>Mankind had grown tired of the Gods
mistreatment and cruelty.</i>

212
00:23:55,063 --> 00:23:59,868
<i>Acrisius led the siege on Olympus.</i>

213
00:23:59,875 --> 00:24:06,181
<i> It is said that the other Gods wanted
to simply lay waste to Acrisius and his army.</i>

214
00:24:06,222 --> 00:24:09,355
<i>But Zeus loved man too much.</i>

215
00:24:09,394 --> 00:24:14,200
<i>Instead, he chose
to make an example of Acrisius.</i>

216
00:24:15,207 --> 00:24:18,476
<i>He disguised himself as the king,</i>

217
00:24:18,515 --> 00:24:22,319
<i>and visited the chamber, where
the king's wife was sleeping.</i>

218
00:24:22,358 --> 00:24:24,426
My king.

219
00:24:32,646 --> 00:24:35,749
Zeus?

220
00:24:40,964 --> 00:24:43,833
<i>Acrisius grew mad with rage.</i>

221
00:24:43,871 --> 00:24:49,978
He ordered the execution of his wife
and Zeus's newborn son.

222
00:24:55,999 --> 00:24:59,803
I curse you Zeus!
I deny you the body you soiled

223
00:24:59,842 --> 00:25:03,511
and the bastard child with it!

224
00:25:20,653 --> 00:25:23,922
The queen and her child were cast into the sea.

225
00:25:23,961 --> 00:25:29,667
Your mother was killed, but you,
half man, part God, you lived.

226
00:25:29,708 --> 00:25:33,177
I've watched over you ever since,
awaiting for the day when you'll help

227
00:25:33,216 --> 00:25:36,452
bringing an end to the tyranny of the Gods.

228
00:25:36,490 --> 00:25:39,692
You are born to kill the Kraken.

229
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:45,204
I don't know why I was born.

230
00:25:45,243 --> 00:25:47,811
Or what I am.

231
00:25:49,216 --> 00:25:52,020
But I know it's not the Kraken I wanna kill.

232
00:25:52,058 --> 00:25:54,190
How do I get to Hades?

233
00:25:54,228 --> 00:26:00,035
If the Kraken falls, Hades will be weak enough
for you to strike a deathly blow.

234
00:26:00,076 --> 00:26:02,744
Only then, will you have the revenge you seek.

235
00:26:02,782 --> 00:26:05,550
Then they'd better release me.

236
00:26:09,361 --> 00:26:12,665
If the Kraken can be killed,
the Stygian witches would know how.

237
00:26:13,370 --> 00:26:16,238
The witches are further away than
any legion has ever been.

238
00:26:16,277 --> 00:26:19,681
- No man can go there.
- No man.

239
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:24,793
Keep your distance Io.

240
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:30,805
Zeus, forgive us for these
affronts and protect us.

241
00:26:31,312 --> 00:26:33,814
And you still believe
they are going to help?

242
00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:38,023
This is suicide.

243
00:26:44,841 --> 00:26:49,246
Here's who you are throwing into this
Perseus, an Honor guard.

244
00:26:49,251 --> 00:26:52,655
Young men who look good
on a reviewing stand.

245
00:26:52,694 --> 00:26:56,063
And old soldiers,
heading to ours retirement.

246
00:26:56,769 --> 00:26:59,372
Do you know what the Kraken is?

247
00:27:00,276 --> 00:27:02,443
The Kraken is the end of us.

248
00:27:02,481 --> 00:27:06,486
A colossal elemental beast.
It doesn't think, it doesn't feel.

249
00:27:06,525 --> 00:27:10,493
Even the Gods fear it,
and you...you're going to kill it?

250
00:27:10,532 --> 00:27:12,665
Don't come.

251
00:27:12,703 --> 00:27:16,207
- I don't need your help.
- Of course not.

252
00:27:16,611 --> 00:27:19,164
You are the son of Zeus.

253
00:27:19,202 --> 00:27:21,685
But we have orders.

254
00:27:21,723 --> 00:27:26,829
Gentlemen, may our journey be long,
filled with agony and torment.

255
00:27:26,869 --> 00:27:29,637
And maybe all complain about
as bitterly as old man.

256
00:27:29,675 --> 00:27:32,343
- So, what should we bring?
- Bring everything.

257
00:27:37,558 --> 00:27:39,761
What makes you think
the witches will tell us anything?

258
00:27:39,798 --> 00:27:43,167
Well, they tell us,
or I'll kill them too.

259
00:27:51,489 --> 00:27:54,292
- What is this?
- Just leave it.

260
00:27:58,204 --> 00:28:02,108
Do not leave us to the mercy
of the Gods, please!

261
00:28:02,148 --> 00:28:05,117
Do not go, please stay!

262
00:28:06,622 --> 00:28:09,825
Stay here, please!
Please! Help us!

263
00:28:14,039 --> 00:28:16,707
Just sacrifice the princess!

264
00:28:16,745 --> 00:28:19,848
Watch your mouth!
Stay back! Stay back!

265
00:28:19,887 --> 00:28:22,956
You think they might be thankful.

266
00:28:24,362 --> 00:28:27,031
Maybe they are tired of being thankful.

267
00:28:27,069 --> 00:28:33,276
Good news! My brother and I have decided
to accompany you on your journey.

268
00:28:33,317 --> 00:28:37,086
- We have enough strangers here.
- We can be of great help to you. Trust me.

269
00:28:37,125 --> 00:28:40,794
- You'll need us.
- I need soldiers, not hunters.

270
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:46,305
Which one of your soldiers knows how to cut
the impenetrable skin of the Nemean lion?

271
00:28:46,346 --> 00:28:51,083
Which one of them knows the soft
points on a centaur's armor?

272
00:28:51,124 --> 00:28:55,827
Which one of them knows which jugular
to slice on a five-headed Hydra?

273
00:28:56,834 --> 00:28:59,688
- The middle one.
- The middle one. Good guess.

274
00:28:59,726 --> 00:29:02,509
My brother and I, we know how to kill.

275
00:29:02,547 --> 00:29:04,152
- We enjoy it.
- If you can keep up,

276
00:29:04,155 --> 00:29:06,454
you don't mind dying. Come along.

277
00:29:07,157 --> 00:29:10,861
It is death who should be afraid of us.

278
00:29:57,168 --> 00:30:01,774
- King Acrisius.
- There's no Acrisius.

279
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:06,084
Just Calibos.

280
00:30:12,102 --> 00:30:17,609
We have an enemy in common.
Zeus.

281
00:30:21,122 --> 00:30:23,524
My brother.

282
00:30:25,331 --> 00:30:27,100
What do you want from me?

283
00:30:27,137 --> 00:30:29,940
Zeus's seed in your
wife, survived.

284
00:30:31,646 --> 00:30:34,649
The child of your shame.

285
00:30:35,554 --> 00:30:39,123
- Perseus.
- He lives?

286
00:30:39,162 --> 00:30:42,231
You murdered your wife for nothing.

287
00:30:42,269 --> 00:30:48,476
Now, Perseus vows himself
from Argos to destroy me.

288
00:30:48,518 --> 00:30:50,518
He must die.

289
00:30:50,521 --> 00:30:55,192
- What would you have me do?
- Zeus must think I serve him,

290
00:30:55,232 --> 00:30:58,867
but, I am growing stronger.

291
00:30:58,906 --> 00:31:02,311
Until I possess my full power,

292
00:31:03,351 --> 00:31:07,721
you will be my weapon.

293
00:31:09,430 --> 00:31:11,433
Come.

294
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,568
Use this.

295
00:31:43,606 --> 00:31:47,075
Kill Perseus for me.

296
00:31:47,114 --> 00:31:55,924
- And I'll destroy Zeus for you.
- I serve you, the boy will die.

297
00:32:00,743 --> 00:32:04,548
- How far is it?
- Four days to the witches.

298
00:32:04,588 --> 00:32:08,257
Four days?
I'm tired already.

299
00:32:11,568 --> 00:32:14,671
Here, use this.

300
00:32:18,483 --> 00:32:21,287
Would you like us to wait?

301
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:24,024
- You really are a fisherman.
- You should have seen my father.

302
00:33:24,064 --> 00:33:26,932
You, bring your weapon.

303
00:33:37,459 --> 00:33:40,462
- Have you handled a sword before?
- It's been no need.

304
00:33:40,501 --> 00:33:43,369
I see.
Left foot forward.

305
00:33:47,481 --> 00:33:50,484
Your motions, should be fluid.

306
00:33:51,389 --> 00:33:53,692
The weapon is a part of you.

307
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:58,503
Let the sting on a wasp.

308
00:34:00,310 --> 00:34:02,612
Stay focused.

309
00:34:02,650 --> 00:34:04,918
Know what surrounds you.

310
00:34:06,424 --> 00:34:08,826
Keep your balance of all times.

311
00:34:08,863 --> 00:34:12,132
If you fall ...

312
00:34:12,171 --> 00:34:14,439
You die.

313
00:34:17,448 --> 00:34:19,651
Get up.

314
00:34:24,965 --> 00:34:26,967
Don't ...

315
00:34:45,310 --> 00:34:47,713
There is a God in you.

316
00:34:47,751 --> 00:34:50,118
Be sure to bring it.

317
00:34:51,223 --> 00:34:53,525
End of lesson.

318
00:35:15,577 --> 00:35:17,780
Perseus ...

319
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:21,720
A gift from the Gods.

320
00:36:21,725 --> 00:36:25,329
- Forged on limbus.
- Why?

321
00:36:25,368 --> 00:36:28,336
Just accept it.

322
00:36:29,141 --> 00:36:31,844
I can do this as a man.

323
00:36:33,752 --> 00:36:36,455
The sword is yours.

324
00:36:45,277 --> 00:36:49,882
Gentlemen, retrieve our Savior.

325
00:37:48,217 --> 00:37:50,720
The Pegasus.

326
00:37:52,126 --> 00:37:55,231
No man has ever ridden one.

327
00:38:00,043 --> 00:38:03,648
It's a message,
they're watching us.

328
00:38:20,991 --> 00:38:24,795
- Perseus!
- Perseus!

329
00:38:27,999 --> 00:38:29,803
Perseus!

330
00:38:31,313 --> 00:38:35,617
- ... why we just always have to...
- Listen!

331
00:38:43,344 --> 00:38:45,446
Help me!

332
00:38:46,348 --> 00:38:48,450
Help me!

333
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:55,064
You reek of your father!

334
00:40:00,813 --> 00:40:03,416
- Who's that?
- I do not know.

335
00:40:03,454 --> 00:40:05,721
Let's ask him.

336
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:51,588
Let it go.

337
00:40:51,626 --> 00:40:54,629
No, we split up.
Just follow the blood.

338
00:41:07,059 --> 00:41:09,062
Come on!

339
00:41:13,574 --> 00:41:16,477
Look, his blood!

340
00:41:41,235 --> 00:41:44,039
Are you happy now?

341
00:41:44,843 --> 00:41:47,346
Attack!

342
00:41:55,768 --> 00:41:57,770
Wait, wait!

343
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:03,383
What is that?

344
00:43:43,507 --> 00:43:47,712
Ixas, lance!

345
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:10,564
Draco!

346
00:44:36,124 --> 00:44:38,526
Jump!

347
00:45:10,701 --> 00:45:12,904
Run!

348
00:45:15,706 --> 00:45:17,909
Everyone, face to face!

349
00:45:31,046 --> 00:45:33,449
Stand the ground.

350
00:45:37,362 --> 00:45:41,366
- Three more!
- In the name of the Gods, they're bigger!

351
00:46:01,915 --> 00:46:04,417
What are they?

352
00:46:04,455 --> 00:46:06,923
Djinn.

353
00:46:08,931 --> 00:46:11,634
I fought them,
in the legion.

354
00:46:11,672 --> 00:46:14,457
This is their desert.

355
00:46:14,495 --> 00:46:17,246
- Enemies?
- I thought so.

356
00:46:17,284 --> 00:46:19,517
They aren't humans, not anymore.

357
00:46:19,554 --> 00:46:22,357
- Desert conjurers, cut-throats.
- Somebody should thank them.

358
00:46:22,395 --> 00:46:24,362
What?

359
00:46:46,214 --> 00:46:50,418
- What is it?
- Venom, from Hades.

360
00:46:52,027 --> 00:46:55,531
- Pray, pray to Zeus for strength.
- No!

361
00:46:55,569 --> 00:46:59,238
Pray to your dumb father.

362
00:47:00,546 --> 00:47:02,748
No!

363
00:47:13,374 --> 00:47:15,777
Take the bread.

364
00:47:33,319 --> 00:47:39,025
We must turn our hearts to Hades,
This is the only way!

365
00:47:41,437 --> 00:47:45,442
Brothers and sisters, come to me!

366
00:47:45,882 --> 00:47:47,249
Come!

367
00:47:49,856 --> 00:47:56,063
I have the way out of our misery!
Hades has asked for the princess!

368
00:47:56,571 --> 00:48:00,176
Sacrifice one, for the life of the city!

369
00:48:03,286 --> 00:48:06,154
Why do they remain silent,
while we suffer?

370
00:48:06,192 --> 00:48:09,696
Why do they guard a woman whose
death will save us?

371
00:48:09,735 --> 00:48:12,971
Is she better than anyone of you?

372
00:48:13,009 --> 00:48:15,562
We've long worshiped Zeus on Argos,

373
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:20,083
but it is Hades
who now offers a salvation!

374
00:48:20,724 --> 00:48:25,329
We must pray to the one,
who showed us our sin!

375
00:48:25,369 --> 00:48:28,338
And who offers us redemption,

376
00:48:28,376 --> 00:48:30,544
through blood!

377
00:48:44,979 --> 00:48:47,582
A bribe for the ferryman.

378
00:48:55,503 --> 00:49:01,610
When they get injured in a battle, they replace
their limbs with chop wood and black magic.

379
00:49:03,721 --> 00:49:06,624
They feel no pain,
live hundreds of years.

380
00:49:07,529 --> 00:49:10,032
So, how old is that one?

381
00:49:13,142 --> 00:49:17,046
I don't care.
I don't trust them.

382
00:49:25,669 --> 00:49:27,972
You're burning.

383
00:49:31,181 --> 00:49:33,584
Drink this.

384
00:49:39,500 --> 00:49:42,103
I'll get more water.

385
00:50:38,732 --> 00:50:40,735
What's he sayin'?

386
00:50:41,037 --> 00:50:44,540
The Djinn have waited many years
for the one who'd free them from the Gods.

387
00:50:45,547 --> 00:50:48,950
- He says, he is no a friend of the humans.
- You don't say it.

388
00:50:50,257 --> 00:50:53,361
But the only way
we can help Perseus, is together.

389
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:03,083
Draco, look.

390
00:51:13,108 --> 00:51:15,211
Together.

391
00:51:32,552 --> 00:51:35,120
- He's not ready to travel yet.
- Time's slipping away Io.

392
00:51:35,158 --> 00:51:38,061
- He's maybe a demigod, but he's still mortal.
- Feeling better?

393
00:51:38,099 --> 00:51:40,166
- A little bit.
- Good.

394
00:51:41,972 --> 00:51:45,176
Your pride is killing my men!
You were given gifts, use them.

395
00:51:45,215 --> 00:51:48,651
- These gifts are a trap!
- I do not care what they are, use them!

396
00:51:48,690 --> 00:51:52,092
No! I do not wanna use that sword
or anything that they give me!

397
00:51:52,130 --> 00:51:55,098
So, we'll just continue to die.

398
00:52:02,418 --> 00:52:05,021
I can't become like them.

399
00:52:07,530 --> 00:52:11,234
If I'd do this,
I'd do it as a man.

400
00:52:13,042 --> 00:52:16,245
But you're not just a man.

401
00:52:16,284 --> 00:52:18,917
I choose to be.

402
00:52:18,955 --> 00:52:24,761
- A man can not do this, Perseus.
- According to whom, the Gods?

403
00:52:38,197 --> 00:52:41,366
If I had your gifts ...

404
00:52:41,405 --> 00:52:43,308
When you need your sword,
it's in my bag.

405
00:52:55,436 --> 00:52:58,239
They're ridin' it.

406
00:53:12,273 --> 00:53:14,976
They just tried to kill us,
I am not getting on it.

407
00:53:16,683 --> 00:53:20,588
Magnificent.
What are you waiting for?

408
00:53:21,093 --> 00:53:24,898
Well, we need to make up
for lost time.

409
00:53:57,775 --> 00:54:00,979
- We're making a good time.
- Not good enough.

410
00:54:01,017 --> 00:54:03,350
The eclipse is drawing near.

411
00:54:03,388 --> 00:54:05,755
How close are we to
the Northern mountains?

412
00:54:05,792 --> 00:54:09,797
It will be two days
before we reach the witches.

413
00:54:14,713 --> 00:54:16,713
This thing is making me
feel sick.

414
00:54:16,717 --> 00:54:18,819
Trust me, it is better
on the one than in one.

415
00:54:26,839 --> 00:54:31,745
- Why don't you ever smile?
- When I spit in the eyes of the Gods.

416
00:54:32,853 --> 00:54:35,056
Then I smile.

417
00:55:14,144 --> 00:55:17,949
- What is this place?
- The Garden of Stygia.

418
00:55:18,654 --> 00:55:21,823
This is where the Kraken
defeated the Titans.

419
00:55:21,862 --> 00:55:24,631
It would Argos look like
when we fail.

420
00:55:24,691 --> 00:55:26,872
Every step we take,
is an insult to the Gods.

421
00:55:26,875 --> 00:55:28,074
Good.

422
00:55:28,077 --> 00:55:34,784
Perseus, only ask what
you need to know, nothing more.

423
00:55:35,493 --> 00:55:37,895
Of course.

424
00:56:17,887 --> 00:56:21,191
- Visitors!
- Who is it?

425
00:56:28,811 --> 00:56:31,715
Who is it?

426
00:56:34,624 --> 00:56:38,792
- Perseus, no.
- We did not come here to fight.

427
00:56:40,036 --> 00:56:43,740
-  A little one question.
- Perseus, the son of Zeus.

428
00:56:47,261 --> 00:56:49,961
The flesh of a God.

429
00:56:51,061 --> 00:56:53,313
Witch!

430
00:56:53,351 --> 00:56:55,568
Easy.

431
00:56:56,372 --> 00:56:59,175
Stay on me, ladies.

432
00:57:03,788 --> 00:57:05,788
So, which one
is gonna answer my question?

433
00:57:05,794 --> 00:57:09,698
You want to know about the Kraken.
How to kill it.

434
00:57:09,737 --> 00:57:12,270
- That's right.
- A wasted journey.

435
00:57:12,308 --> 00:57:15,011
The Kraken fears no weapons.

436
00:57:15,049 --> 00:57:17,282
It must have a weakness.

437
00:57:17,319 --> 00:57:22,925
Maybe, but the knowledge demands payment!
Sacrifice! Sacrifice!

438
00:57:34,557 --> 00:57:36,560
The eye!

439
00:57:40,270 --> 00:57:42,270
- Let him go!
- No!

440
00:57:42,274 --> 00:57:44,577
- Do it!
- You wouldn't dare!

441
00:57:45,582 --> 00:57:49,787
- We can not see the answer without the eye.
- Let him go!

442
00:57:50,793 --> 00:57:53,646
Now answer the question!

443
00:57:53,685 --> 00:57:56,468
How do we kill the Kraken?

444
00:57:56,507 --> 00:57:59,810
There is a solution,
but it is an impossible one.

445
00:58:00,615 --> 00:58:03,784
The Gorgon Medusa.

446
00:58:03,823 --> 00:58:08,093
Anything of flesh is killed by her gaze.

447
00:58:08,132 --> 00:58:12,086
Her prison lies across the river Styx
at the edge of the Underworld.

448
00:58:12,126 --> 00:58:16,046
- A Titan against the Titan.
- She's no use against the Kraken.

449
00:58:16,085 --> 00:58:18,252
We can't control her.

450
00:58:19,056 --> 00:58:22,060
- Then we'll take her head.
- Clever boy.

451
00:58:22,098 --> 00:58:25,767
And the eye, give us the eye.

452
00:58:36,997 --> 00:58:40,601
Wait, there's more.
Don't you want to know more?

453
00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:43,275
Perseus, no.

454
00:58:43,312 --> 00:58:45,878
- Tell him. Tell him!
- What?

455
00:58:45,916 --> 00:58:49,720
Your journey does not end well.

456
00:58:49,759 --> 00:58:53,428
Fate has spoken.

457
00:58:54,936 --> 00:58:59,441
You will die, son of Zeus.

458
00:59:00,749 --> 00:59:05,454
- It's a lie...Come.
- what's written is history.

459
00:59:07,865 --> 00:59:12,070
Perseus, you will die.

460
00:59:31,016 --> 00:59:34,821
- Why are the Djin leaving us?
- They believe we will all die.

461
00:59:34,860 --> 00:59:37,327
It's the prophecy.

462
00:59:58,077 --> 01:00:00,579
Who are you?

463
01:00:08,200 --> 01:00:12,203
Well, you can call me...father.

464
01:00:12,909 --> 01:00:15,984
- If you wish.
- My father is dead.

465
01:00:15,988 --> 01:00:17,087
He's killed by a God.

466
01:00:17,089 --> 01:00:20,988
An unfortunate casualty
on the war men brought on themselves.

467
01:00:20,993 --> 01:00:25,492
Men didn't murder my family,
your brother did.

468
01:00:26,030 --> 01:00:30,536
You heard the witches' prophecy,
you won't defeat the Kraken, ...much less Hades.

469
01:00:30,576 --> 01:00:34,712
If you continue this journey you will die
and Argos will still fall.

470
01:00:34,751 --> 01:00:38,854
- If you're so sure, why are you here?
- To offer you a sanctuary.

471
01:00:38,894 --> 01:00:42,628
Your blood is mine Perseus,
and that makes you a God.

472
01:00:42,667 --> 01:00:45,536
It's time to came to Olympus
and start to living like one.

473
01:00:45,574 --> 01:00:48,342
I'd rather die in the mud with those men,
than live forever as a God.

474
01:00:48,380 --> 01:00:53,286
You foolish boy, men's entire existence
is the gift of my grace.

475
01:00:53,327 --> 01:00:57,296
For someone who created men,
you don't know much about us.

476
01:00:58,002 --> 01:01:04,309
We live, we fight and we die for each other.

477
01:01:04,351 --> 01:01:06,919
Not for you.

478
01:01:07,222 --> 01:01:10,176
Tell Hades I'll see him soon.

479
01:01:10,214 --> 01:01:13,097
- I will not make this offer again.
- Good.

480
01:01:13,135 --> 01:01:16,940
- 'Cause I hate to refuse you twice.
- Perseus ...

481
01:01:17,846 --> 01:01:19,848
Wait.

482
01:01:26,264 --> 01:01:29,468
It's expensive where you're going.

483
01:01:52,423 --> 01:01:56,327
Kucuk fashioned this shield from the scorpion.

484
01:01:56,366 --> 01:01:59,767
Stronger and lighter than any metal.

485
01:01:59,806 --> 01:02:03,243
Very rare and high quality item.

486
01:02:06,454 --> 01:02:09,457
We can fight anywhere...

487
01:02:10,162 --> 01:02:13,366
But not in the Underworld.

488
01:02:19,984 --> 01:02:22,387
Good luck, fisherman.

489
01:02:36,020 --> 01:02:39,323
You've heard what the witches said.

490
01:02:39,362 --> 01:02:42,631
But we can prove them wrong.

491
01:02:43,436 --> 01:02:46,339
I need your help.

492
01:02:55,764 --> 01:02:59,268
It wasn't the Gods who saved me up there.

493
01:02:59,973 --> 01:03:02,277
If you believe that we have a chance.

494
01:03:06,288 --> 01:03:08,790
I never liked Argos much anyway.

495
01:03:13,704 --> 01:03:15,407
I know the way.

496
01:03:20,319 --> 01:03:24,323
Then we go to the Underworld...
We kill Medusa.

497
01:04:13,337 --> 01:04:16,842
- Now what?
- We wait for Charon.

498
01:04:18,048 --> 01:04:22,453
- Charon only ferries the dead.
- Any volunteers?

499
01:04:32,580 --> 01:04:34,982
Heads, we swim.

500
01:04:59,340 --> 01:05:02,043
A bribe for the ferryman.

501
01:05:58,170 --> 01:06:01,675
- So, what happens when we get there?
- Just another beast to kill.

502
01:06:02,422 --> 01:06:04,447
A Beast?

503
01:06:04,484 --> 01:06:07,353
Medusa was beautiful once.

504
01:06:07,391 --> 01:06:10,895
So beautiful, that has tempted Poseidon.

505
01:06:10,934 --> 01:06:14,403
When he came for her,
she ran to Athena's temple,

506
01:06:14,442 --> 01:06:17,711
thinking that the Goddess will protect her.

507
01:06:17,750 --> 01:06:20,910
She didn't.

508
01:06:20,920 --> 01:06:24,189
Poseidon took her on the cold floor.

509
01:06:24,228 --> 01:06:29,087
She prayed to Athena for comfort,
but the Goddess felt nothing but disgust.

510
01:06:29,093 --> 01:06:33,192
She made sure no one
would ever want Medusa again.

511
01:06:33,197 --> 01:06:37,696
One look at the creature she has become
would turn any living thing to stone.

512
01:06:37,793 --> 01:06:42,428
I can not assist you there,
my curse prevents me.

513
01:06:42,468 --> 01:06:47,574
It was Athena's one bit of solace to Medusa,
so the Medusa would never harm a woman.

514
01:06:47,680 --> 01:06:50,684
Only men are allowed in the temple.

515
01:06:50,722 --> 01:06:54,191
But no man has ever made it out.

516
01:07:27,970 --> 01:07:32,075
Medusa got a tail and and
that's how she'll use it.

517
01:07:32,114 --> 01:07:34,447
Listen.

518
01:07:34,485 --> 01:07:37,538
Hear her muscles call you.

519
01:07:37,576 --> 01:07:40,560
Smell her skin.

520
01:07:40,599 --> 01:07:43,602
Feel her hunger in your gut.

521
01:07:45,008 --> 01:07:47,476
Medusa has killed you twice now.

522
01:07:47,514 --> 01:07:49,616
Do you think she'll hand you her head?

523
01:07:49,653 --> 01:07:52,486
She won't be gracious about it.

524
01:07:52,524 --> 01:07:56,329
One look in her eyes and
you'll turn to stone.

525
01:07:57,636 --> 01:07:59,839
Good.

526
01:08:03,249 --> 01:08:06,953
- Try not to enjoy this so much...
- I'm trying to help you live.

527
01:08:08,761 --> 01:08:10,863
Don't look at me!

528
01:08:30,410 --> 01:08:33,713
Ease your storm.

529
01:08:41,534 --> 01:08:44,638
We are near Medusa's lair.

530
01:08:59,574 --> 01:09:02,677
I've never thought that
I could reach this place.

531
01:09:04,084 --> 01:09:07,588
Who's you lose?

532
01:09:12,403 --> 01:09:15,206
My daughter.

533
01:09:16,411 --> 01:09:19,915
Taken away on her sixteenth birthday.

534
01:09:19,954 --> 01:09:22,787
Dragged her down here.

535
01:09:22,825 --> 01:09:26,129
I have a feeling I'll see her soon.

536
01:09:29,140 --> 01:09:33,745
You brought us this far,
let's go to the rest of the way.

537
01:09:52,993 --> 01:09:56,497
- How many coins did you get from Zeus?
- Just one.

538
01:10:21,556 --> 01:10:24,760
I knew one great man in my life.

539
01:10:26,568 --> 01:10:29,371
My father.

540
01:10:31,278 --> 01:10:34,582
Now I know four more.

541
01:10:36,389 --> 01:10:38,992
And the woman.

542
01:10:40,399 --> 01:10:43,402
And whatever the hell you are.

543
01:10:46,412 --> 01:10:48,779
I know we are all afraid.

544
01:10:48,817 --> 01:10:54,023
But my father told me, someday
someone's gonna have to make a stand.

545
01:10:54,063 --> 01:10:58,333
Someday,
someone's gonna have to say "Enough"!

546
01:11:00,042 --> 01:11:03,146
This could be that day.

547
01:11:03,350 --> 01:11:07,755
Trust your senses
and don't look this bitch in the eye!

548
01:11:38,528 --> 01:11:42,433
- Doesn't really inspire confidence.
- Quiet.

549
01:11:42,639 --> 01:11:47,542
Listen...Eusebios, keep your eyes down.

550
01:12:08,495 --> 01:12:11,299
Here we go!

551
01:12:27,437 --> 01:12:29,941
Keep going!

552
01:12:30,440 --> 01:12:31,944
Try, go.

553
01:12:36,358 --> 01:12:40,626
- Draco...
- Go!

554
01:12:40,666 --> 01:12:43,369
Eusebios, follow me!

555
01:12:47,682 --> 01:12:50,886
Hang on!

556
01:13:21,462 --> 01:13:23,666
Eusebios...

557
01:13:25,967 --> 01:13:29,671
Remember what Perseus said.

558
01:13:34,186 --> 01:13:37,089
Eyes down!

559
01:13:50,823 --> 01:13:53,426
Ixas, no.

560
01:13:59,372 --> 01:14:01,675
Eyes down.

561
01:14:05,585 --> 01:14:08,389
Where are you?

562
01:14:10,090 --> 01:14:12,394
Where are you?

563
01:14:20,619 --> 01:14:22,423
Eusebios...

564
01:14:28,027 --> 01:14:30,431
Go!

565
01:14:44,873 --> 01:14:47,626
Wait here.

566
01:14:47,664 --> 01:14:50,374
I'll whirl her out.

567
01:14:50,412 --> 01:14:53,088
Get ready!

568
01:15:39,494 --> 01:15:41,497
Now!

569
01:15:57,436 --> 01:16:01,339
Now we must die together!

570
01:16:42,634 --> 01:16:45,638
Let them know, men did this.

571
01:18:10,830 --> 01:18:14,334
Just you and me, son of Zeus.

572
01:19:22,460 --> 01:19:24,828
Perseus ...

573
01:19:24,866 --> 01:19:28,970
Don't become one of them.

574
01:19:42,605 --> 01:19:45,709
Io, I'm here.

575
01:19:46,815 --> 01:19:49,318
There is no time.

576
01:19:51,625 --> 01:19:54,393
The eclipse...

577
01:19:54,432 --> 01:19:58,736
Perseus, you must go before it's too late.

578
01:20:02,850 --> 01:20:05,518
I'm not going anywhere.

579
01:20:05,556 --> 01:20:10,462
My fate is certain, but the fate
of Argos is still in your hands.

580
01:20:12,171 --> 01:20:14,774
All my life, you've been there.

581
01:20:15,679 --> 01:20:18,682
You've never left me.

582
01:20:18,720 --> 01:20:21,654
I can't leave you.

583
01:20:21,692 --> 01:20:25,060
This part of the journey you must do alone.

584
01:20:25,099 --> 01:20:29,705
Perseus, you are not just part man, part God....

585
01:20:31,213 --> 01:20:34,217
You're the best of both.

586
01:20:38,930 --> 01:20:42,935
Everything will be all right.

587
01:21:37,260 --> 01:21:39,327
Brother...

588
01:21:39,365 --> 01:21:43,670
It is time for the mortals to pay!

589
01:21:45,679 --> 01:21:49,884
My child waits to do your will.

590
01:21:58,708 --> 01:22:01,411
Leave us.

591
01:22:07,427 --> 01:22:11,031
Release the Kraken!

592
01:22:37,494 --> 01:22:40,863
The Kraken comes now!

593
01:22:40,901 --> 01:22:45,406
Our suffering ends,
when the beast is sated.

594
01:22:45,446 --> 01:22:48,280
Will it take us?

595
01:22:48,319 --> 01:22:52,824
Or will it take Andromeda?!

596
01:22:57,038 --> 01:22:59,906
It's my name they are calling.

597
01:22:59,944 --> 01:23:03,048
This can not continue.

598
01:23:44,043 --> 01:23:46,247
That's the Kraken!

599
01:24:14,211 --> 01:24:16,614
Andromeda!

600
01:24:18,721 --> 01:24:23,226
Hades, we sacrifice our
princess in your name.

601
01:24:29,244 --> 01:24:33,349
It comes, brothers and sisters!

602
01:25:03,720 --> 01:25:06,288
Argos is fallen.

603
01:25:06,326 --> 01:25:09,294
Do you feel stronger, brother?

604
01:25:09,333 --> 01:25:12,937
You thought the Kraken will
bring you their prayers.

605
01:25:12,976 --> 01:25:15,309
But the Kraken is my child.

606
01:25:15,346 --> 01:25:19,150
- It feeds only me.
- I command Olympus.

607
01:25:19,189 --> 01:25:23,476
- Remember who you serve!
- I serve myself.

608
01:25:23,516 --> 01:25:27,769
I have, since you cheated me.

609
01:25:28,175 --> 01:25:33,581
You sent me to the Underworld to be hated
while you bath in their love.

610
01:25:33,622 --> 01:25:37,391
- We need the love of humans.
- No, you need it.

611
01:25:37,430 --> 01:25:39,763
I survived on their fear.

612
01:25:39,801 --> 01:25:42,169
Your reign is over, brother Zeus.

613
01:25:42,206 --> 01:25:46,410
You watch while my blessed avenger
devours their hopes,

614
01:25:46,450 --> 01:25:49,719
and then, finally...you will know my pain.

615
01:25:49,757 --> 01:25:55,829
There is still a demigod in Argos, brother.

616
01:25:59,945 --> 01:26:02,448
Perseus ...

617
01:26:34,322 --> 01:26:36,525
The bag!
Come on!

618
01:30:21,568 --> 01:30:23,771
No!

619
01:31:10,838 --> 01:31:14,942
I am a God.
I will live forever.

620
01:31:15,081 --> 01:31:17,349
But not here.

621
01:32:41,498 --> 01:32:44,842
The boats are coming for us.

622
01:32:48,906 --> 01:32:51,705
For you, not for me.

623
01:32:51,709 --> 01:32:54,630
You won't stay, will you?

624
01:32:54,669 --> 01:32:57,572
Perseus, Argos needs a ruler.

625
01:32:57,610 --> 01:33:00,143
I can not be a king.

626
01:33:00,181 --> 01:33:03,184
I serve you better as a man.

627
01:33:03,222 --> 01:33:06,191
You'll make a fine Queen for them.

628
01:33:45,682 --> 01:33:48,685
Olympus owes you a debt of gratitude.

629
01:33:49,992 --> 01:33:53,245
- As do I.
- Hades lives.

630
01:33:53,283 --> 01:33:56,467
He's again back in the Underworld.

631
01:33:56,506 --> 01:33:58,674
Buying his time, no doubt.

632
01:33:58,711 --> 01:34:02,980
Waiting for men to go weakened,
and in their weakness he grows stronger.

633
01:34:03,020 --> 01:34:06,725
It's mankind who holds the key
to Hades' rise, it always was.

634
01:34:06,764 --> 01:34:09,397
So, we'll see him again?

635
01:34:09,435 --> 01:34:13,139
Yes, but now the world knows
a man who can stop him.

636
01:34:14,847 --> 01:34:17,550
Of course, you had some help.

637
01:34:17,588 --> 01:34:21,357
A sword, the Pegasus.

638
01:34:22,263 --> 01:34:26,568
I wanted men to worship us again,
but I didn't want it to cost me a son.

639
01:34:28,778 --> 01:34:30,778
That's almost human of you.

640
01:34:30,782 --> 01:34:32,885
I don't suppose you reconsider my offer,

641
01:34:32,922 --> 01:34:34,989
to take your place as one of us?

642
01:34:38,699 --> 01:34:41,102
I have everything I need right here.

643
01:34:41,907 --> 01:34:44,475
You may not want to be a God, Perseus.

644
01:34:44,513 --> 01:34:48,217
But after feats like yours,
men will worship you.

645
01:34:48,822 --> 01:34:51,089
Be good to them.

646
01:34:51,127 --> 01:34:53,230
Be better than we were.

647
01:34:54,134 --> 01:34:58,038
And if you insist on continuing
this mundane human existence,

648
01:34:58,077 --> 01:35:00,645
I won't have you do it alone.

649
01:35:01,350 --> 01:35:03,653
You're the son of Zeus, after all!

00:00:01,567 --> 00:03:11,380 


1
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:23,161
We're riding towards Absolution.

2
00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:25,988
You know how far west we are?

3
00:03:33,784 --> 00:03:35,781
Maybe he's a dummy.

4
00:03:36,387 --> 00:03:39,703
Is there a reason you're not
answering my question?

5
00:03:39,791 --> 00:03:43,158
Look here Pa.
He's got iron on his wrist.

6
00:03:43,158 --> 00:03:45,090
He's been shot.

7
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:49,360
Could be he done broke out of hoosegow.
Might be worth bounty-money.

8
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,055
It could be ...

9
00:03:58,582 --> 00:04:01,317
It's not your lucky day, stranger..

10
00:04:02,712 --> 00:04:05,280
Turn around and start walking.

11
00:04:06,373 --> 00:04:09,071
I said turn around
and start walking.

14
00:06:59,336 --> 00:07:01,218
Get lost!

15
00:07:37,716 --> 00:07:39,868
There 'no?

16
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:35,117
Balls to heaven, friend.

17
00:08:35,342 --> 00:08:37,391
Calm ...

18
00:08:43,531 --> 00:08:47,392
Alright, turn around,
nice and slow.

19
00:08:48,011 --> 00:08:50,261
I've been shot.

20
00:08:56,336 --> 00:08:58,586
Only two kinds of men get shot.

21
00:08:58,586 --> 00:09:01,418
Criminals and victims.

22
00:09:01,836 --> 00:09:04,260
Well, which one are ya?

23
00:09:04,706 --> 00:09:06,350
I do not know.

24
00:09:06,604 --> 00:09:10,803
You got a name, friend?
I don't know that either.

25
00:09:11,890 --> 00:09:14,373
Well, just what do you know?

26
00:09:14,878 --> 00:09:16,956
The English ...

27
00:09:23,712 --> 00:09:28,169
Well, that... That's a right
odd-looking wound there.

28
00:09:29,341 --> 00:09:32,000
Must 'cauterization.

29
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:34,852
Stink 'a little' ...

30
00:09:36,903 --> 00:09:39,940
- That's it.
- It 'a city' mining?

31
00:09:42,426 --> 00:09:45,631
You ', well, from what they say.

32
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:49,059
The people he's' gone, anyway ...

33
00:09:49,642 --> 00:09:51,018
no gold.

34
00:09:51,118 --> 00:09:54,006
Alright now, try and hold still.

35
00:09:56,627 --> 00:09:58,592
There we go.

36
00:09:59,753 --> 00:10:02,252
This is no gunshot.

37
00:10:02,505 --> 00:10:05,230
Where did ya get this, son?
-I don't know.

38
00:10:05,486 --> 00:10:09,984
Well I can't rightly absolve you of your sins,
If you don't recall now, can I?

39
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:13,761
That being said, I've seen
good men do bad things

40
00:10:13,761 --> 00:10:16,415
bad men do good things.

41
00:10:17,078 --> 00:10:19,665
Whether you're gonna end up
in heaven or hell...

42
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:22,756
it's not God's plan,
that's your own.

43
00:10:23,396 --> 00:10:25,988
You just gotta remember
What it was.

44
00:10:25,988 --> 00:10:29,226
Alright, put your finger
right here. Come On.

45
00:10:29,827 --> 00:10:31,618
There you go.

46
00:10:35,471 --> 00:10:38,964
- Done.
- Thanks.

47
00:10:39,491 --> 00:10:41,758
Not bad for
a country priest.

48
00:10:47,812 --> 00:10:51,034
It's that damn fool Dolarhyde kid

49
00:10:51,879 --> 00:10:56,691
Hey, hey hey hey!
What are you doing?
Percy, there's people out there.

50
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:57,826
There's no-one out there, it's fine.

51
00:10:57,826 --> 00:11:00,128
It's not fine. It's bad enough
he drinks for free...

52
00:11:00,128 --> 00:11:02,293
..and now he's gonna shoot up the place?

53
00:11:02,393 --> 00:11:03,931
Hey what was that, doc?

54
00:11:03,931 --> 00:11:07,416
Nothing. He didn's say anything.
Everything's okay. -Go back inside.

55
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:09,159
Wait!

56
00:11:10,742 --> 00:11:14,845
I wanna hear what you said.
It's bad enough... what?

57
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:19,120
Are you ungrateful for our business?

58
00:11:19,226 --> 00:11:21,687
'Because if it wasn't
for my Pa's cattle,

59
00:11:21,687 --> 00:11:23,848
There'll be no money going
through this town.

60
00:11:23,848 --> 00:11:26,582
And there would be no
meat on your tables

61
00:11:26,582 --> 00:11:30,051
And your doors would
be closed. Huh?

62
00:11:30,556 --> 00:11:33,440
I don't mean no disrespect to your
father, Percy. You know that.

63
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:37,190
Of course not. But you ask me to pay

64
00:11:38,967 --> 00:11:41,063
Come here to settle
the matter.

65
00:11:42,142 --> 00:11:43,889
Come here.

66
00:11:48,988 --> 00:11:54,305
Hey kid, I do not want any trouble.
I'm just trying to...

67
00:11:55,750 --> 00:12:00,804
Better pick up your glasses, doc,
before someone steps on them.

68
00:12:09,083 --> 00:12:13,243
Alright son, we're just trying
to make a living now.

69
00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:17,057
You know what, preacher?
You just gave me an idea.

70
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:20,502
I know it ain't Sunday, folks, but...

71
00:12:20,638 --> 00:12:24,661
What say we take up a collection
for the poor man, huh?

72
00:12:24,661 --> 00:12:27,528
Now who's got money?

73
00:12:28,617 --> 00:12:30,915
In the hat ...

74
00:12:31,321 --> 00:12:34,322
Let's go, much obliged.

75
00:12:34,488 --> 00:12:39,380
I'm sorry, doc's bad fortune has to
be taken out on you good people.

76
00:12:40,402 --> 00:12:42,785
Very Christian of you.

77
00:12:46,772 --> 00:12:48,773
Hey!

78
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:51,879
You too.

79
00:12:52,017 --> 00:12:56,326
You wanna be careful where you 
point that thing before you get hurt.

80
00:13:02,897 --> 00:13:05,360
Listen ...

81
00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:11,163
I'm gonna give you the benefit
of the doubt, because...

82
00:13:11,657 --> 00:13:15,024
Maybe you don't know who I am.

83
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:29,524
Leave me alone!

84
00:13:29,524 --> 00:13:31,975
Hey, you!

85
00:13:32,939 --> 00:13:35,005
I warn you ...

86
00:13:48,365 --> 00:13:51,872
Where the hell did he come from?

87
00:13:52,815 --> 00:13:54,921
What the hell is going on here?

88
00:13:56,047 --> 00:13:58,172
It 'was an accident ...

89
00:13:58,172 --> 00:14:01,537
He came out of nowhere.
And he dry gulched me.

90
00:14:01,637 --> 00:14:03,959
He tried to make me look like a fool.

91
00:14:03,959 --> 00:14:05,992
It's not 'my fault, sheriff.

92
00:14:05,992 --> 00:14:08,615
Damn it, Percy. You've crossed
the line this time.

93
00:14:08,715 --> 00:14:09,660
I gotta lock ya up.

94
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:11,532
Taggart.

95
00:14:11,722 --> 00:14:14,535
You know that is not 'a good idea.

96
00:14:14,646 --> 00:14:17,297
Well I'm afraid I got no choice, Ned.

97
00:14:20,048 --> 00:14:24,563
Ned? Ned, you son of a bitch,
where are you going?

98
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:29,872
Don't worry. I'll tell your father
about what happened today.

99
00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:36,397
Don't ruin the coffee there, yankee.

100
00:14:36,397 --> 00:14:40,173
Well, tell you what Ed.
The next time you can have coffee.

101
00:14:40,397 --> 00:14:43,773
-Okay, alright. -Hey why don't you take
it easy on that tileslacking, Murphy

102
00:14:43,902 --> 00:14:46,011
Mr. Dolarhyde don't like
drinking on the job..

103
00:14:46,011 --> 00:14:49,569
Mr. Dolarhyde not like
that you drink at work?

104
00:14:51,023 --> 00:14:56,092
I don't give a rat's ass what the high and mighty Colonel Dolarhyde don't like it or not.

105
00:14:56,618 --> 00:14:59,847
I don't care how many Indians he put under neither.

106
00:15:00,194 --> 00:15:03,548
You sure do slap your guns a lot
when the boss ain't around.

107
00:15:07,881 --> 00:15:10,853
I'd say it to his face if he was here!

108
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:14,346
Colonel Dolarhyde ...

109
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:22,826
Let me tell you something, guys.

110
00:15:24,424 --> 00:15:26,894
Money makes you soft.

111
00:16:03,473 --> 00:16:05,946
Where the hell is that coach?

112
00:16:05,946 --> 00:16:09,836
-Coach? What coach?
-You shot a deputy, Percy.

113
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:12,613
Federal Marshal's bringing
you to Santa Fe.

114
00:16:12,622 --> 00:16:16,660
Federal Marshal?
Sherriff, have you lost your mind?

115
00:16:17,658 --> 00:16:19,912
My pa is on his way down here.

116
00:16:19,912 --> 00:16:22,693
you better let me out of here,
before things get out of hand.

117
00:16:23,533 --> 00:16:26,415
Sheriff, and 'was an accident.

118
00:16:26,415 --> 00:16:28,859
it's not like I'm Jesse James..!

119
00:16:28,859 --> 00:16:30,719
Bastard ...

120
00:16:31,765 --> 00:16:35,254
Hey, -your whisky
-can you put that on Percy's tab?

121
00:16:36,972 --> 00:16:38,810
Fifty cents.

122
00:16:39,242 --> 00:16:41,533
Just kidding with you there, pal.

123
00:16:45,277 --> 00:16:47,734
Have they no respect in this town?

124
00:16:47,806 --> 00:16:49,570
That's not true, okay?

125
00:16:50,903 --> 00:16:53,274
-You wanna leave?
-No.

126
00:16:53,274 --> 00:16:56,058
This is your dream.
I'd follow you anywhere.

127
00:16:56,058 --> 00:16:58,291
I thought it was our dream.

128
00:16:59,547 --> 00:17:01,255
Damn.

129
00:17:01,255 --> 00:17:03,793
Charlie, why don't you play
something festive!

130
00:17:03,793 --> 00:17:06,555
It's like a funeral in here.

131
00:17:11,429 --> 00:17:14,286
Hey. You don't have to
prove anything, okay?

132
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:17,043
Ok? I love you.

133
00:17:17,043 --> 00:17:18,890
Not now.

134
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:33,742
Whisky.

135
00:17:39,522 --> 00:17:41,748
On the house.
For what you did.

136
00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:03,999
I came here just to drink.

137
00:18:08,852 --> 00:18:11,535
- I know you?
- No ...

138
00:18:16,838 --> 00:18:18,940
My name is Ella ...

139
00:18:21,773 --> 00:18:24,329
Where'd you get that bracelet?

140
00:18:26,184 --> 00:18:28,824
Is there something you
know about me maybe?

141
00:18:30,726 --> 00:18:33,638
You do not remember anything, do you?

142
00:18:36,842 --> 00:18:38,776
What do you want?

143
00:18:38,776 --> 00:18:41,182
I know you're looking for something.

144
00:18:41,682 --> 00:18:43,705
So am I.

145
00:18:45,669 --> 00:18:47,986
Well, good luck to you.

146
00:18:55,814 --> 00:18:57,975
Go away.

147
00:19:05,871 --> 00:19:08,499
Jake Lonergan.

148
00:19:27,238 --> 00:19:31,962
Follow me to the office, so
we can have us a little chat

149
00:19:34,946 --> 00:19:37,560
I think you've got the wrong man.

150
00:19:39,697 --> 00:19:42,876
Well, I'm gonna need you to
come with us all the same.

151
00:19:46,161 --> 00:19:48,690
Wouldn't do that if I was you.

152
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:21,791
I do not want trouble.

153
00:21:04,686 --> 00:21:07,496
Hello there ', sunshine!

154
00:21:10,529 --> 00:21:12,985
You're in trouble now..!

155
00:21:13,065 --> 00:21:15,045
You're gonna burn.

156
00:21:15,045 --> 00:21:17,931
here, my pa is coming for me.

157
00:21:18,114 --> 00:21:23,178
He learned how to kill a man
good, and slow. In the war

158
00:21:23,464 --> 00:21:26,600
I am gonna watch you suffer...

159
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:33,061
...for a long, long time.

160
00:21:34,102 --> 00:21:38,854
You thought that cheap shot
in the pecker hurt, huh?

161
00:21:46,946 --> 00:21:50,677
Please. I didn't steal your cow.

162
00:21:50,961 --> 00:21:54,041
Colonel Dolarhyde, you've
gotta believe me.

163
00:21:56,351 --> 00:22:00,204
You've only been riding for my
bran for what, two weeks?

164
00:22:02,290 --> 00:22:05,811
You don't maybe know whom
you're dealing with, Roy.

165
00:22:09,121 --> 00:22:11,802
Nobody calls me Colonel.

166
00:22:12,621 --> 00:22:15,433
And them who that did are mostly dead.

167
00:22:18,472 --> 00:22:20,185
Please.

168
00:22:22,512 --> 00:22:26,472
So you had little Mickey's picking
up strays. How many did you get?

169
00:22:26,472 --> 00:22:29,024
About forty-four of 'em, boss.

170
00:22:29,024 --> 00:22:31,327
You've been drinking, ain't
ya? I can smell it on ya.

171
00:22:31,327 --> 00:22:34,628
I haven't been drinking nothing.
You said it yourself, we shouldn't do drinking

172
00:22:34,728 --> 00:22:39,216
What kind of a man goes 'round
blowing up other peoples cows,

173
00:22:39,216 --> 00:22:42,172
then tells a bullshit story like this?

174
00:22:42,172 --> 00:22:46,191
You could't do no better?
-You gotta believe me, there was a white light.

175
00:22:46,191 --> 00:22:47,784
This bright light.

176
00:22:47,784 --> 00:22:50,185
So there was this big light...

177
00:22:50,185 --> 00:22:53,134
and you fell in the river, and
when you come back...

178
00:22:53,251 --> 00:22:56,582
two of my best hands
has just disappeared.

179
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:00,171
There 'was no storm.

180
00:23:00,529 --> 00:23:03,658
There weren't no lightning this evening.

181
00:23:03,658 --> 00:23:06,625
You don't respect me, do you Roy?

182
00:23:10,097 --> 00:23:11,747
Where 'Percy?

183
00:23:11,910 --> 00:23:14,633
-Taggart locked him up, boss.
-Why?

184
00:23:15,387 --> 00:23:18,612
-What did he do now?
-Shot a deputy.

185
00:23:18,662 --> 00:23:20,497
Damn.

186
00:23:20,497 --> 00:23:23,326
What the hell does Taggart
think he's doing?

187
00:23:23,326 --> 00:23:25,520
He wouldn't even have a job...

188
00:23:25,674 --> 00:23:28,744
Now I gotta go in there
and reason with him...

189
00:23:28,744 --> 00:23:32,020
...because you failed to
look after my boy.

190
00:23:36,241 --> 00:23:38,678
Thanks ... Thank you.

191
00:23:41,216 --> 00:23:43,400
Alright. Everybody saddle up.

192
00:23:48,153 --> 00:23:51,001
Boss, we oughta get more hands.

193
00:23:51,001 --> 00:23:53,572
- Why '?
- You will not believe ...

194
00:23:53,672 --> 00:23:56,411
I think Jake Lonergan
is in the city '.

195
00:24:07,739 --> 00:24:10,566
I'm turning you over to the Federal Marshal.

196
00:24:12,388 --> 00:24:14,764
You're gonna tell me
what I'm charged with?

197
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:20,861
Arson, assault, mayhem...

198
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:23,202
theft ....

199
00:24:24,062 --> 00:24:26,290
It says you robbed the stage last month.

200
00:24:26,290 --> 00:24:29,161
With Pat Dolan and Bull McCade.

201
00:24:29,397 --> 00:24:33,160
Which makes you an accesory
to everyone they broke, too.

202
00:24:38,537 --> 00:24:41,722
- Is that all?
- Murder.

203
00:24:42,938 --> 00:24:46,078
Prostitute out in Cottonwood Grove
has con you over.

204
00:24:46,078 --> 00:24:49,142
Her name was Alison Wills.

205
00:24:50,284 --> 00:24:52,876
You say that I killed
this woman?

206
00:24:52,876 --> 00:24:54,830
You tell me.

207
00:25:38,808 --> 00:25:40,561
Oh, well.

208
00:25:44,414 --> 00:25:46,432
Gimme your wrist.

209
00:25:46,508 --> 00:25:49,418
Taggart, what are you doing?

210
00:25:49,494 --> 00:25:53,812
Sheriff, this is going too far, I....

211
00:25:55,064 --> 00:25:57,123
I was just fooling around.

212
00:25:58,499 --> 00:26:00,728
Look, I didn't mean to hurt anybody.

213
00:26:00,785 --> 00:26:03,391
- Go away.
- Look, I'm sorry.

214
00:26:03,691 --> 00:26:06,133
But I had no choice.
I couldn't let you leave.

215
00:26:06,133 --> 00:26:08,587
Well, I'm leaving now.

216
00:26:08,990 --> 00:26:13,217
--I need you.
-If you have got something to say, say it.

217
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:17,213
I need to know,
where you come from.

218
00:26:17,469 --> 00:26:19,689
So do I.

219
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:22,728
Lady ...

220
00:26:28,188 --> 00:26:30,863
You gov'ners have a nice trip now.

221
00:26:32,610 --> 00:26:35,567
Taggart. Taggart, let me out of here.

222
00:26:36,387 --> 00:26:38,063
Sheriff!

223
00:26:38,628 --> 00:26:40,362
Sheriff!

224
00:26:40,998 --> 00:26:42,910
What are you doing?

225
00:26:43,969 --> 00:26:46,078
You get back home. Go to bed.

226
00:26:46,078 --> 00:26:49,905
-Please, do not go.
-I have to, Emmett. It's my job.

227
00:26:51,335 --> 00:26:53,090
I do not like it here.

228
00:26:53,566 --> 00:26:57,052
Now your pa is getting things in order
and when he does, he'll send for you.

229
00:26:57,052 --> 00:26:59,185
It's been a year.

230
00:26:59,453 --> 00:27:01,538
Don't worry, he will

231
00:27:02,902 --> 00:27:05,432
And your mom is buried here.

232
00:27:05,739 --> 00:27:07,848
And you know I can't leave my little girl.

233
00:27:15,264 --> 00:27:18,161
- Taggart.
- It ', I see them.

234
00:27:19,034 --> 00:27:20,991
Go inside.

235
00:27:40,404 --> 00:27:42,649
I want my boy, John.

236
00:27:48,627 --> 00:27:51,018
- I knew you'd come, dad '.
- Shut up.

237
00:27:51,018 --> 00:27:53,327
i'll deal with you later.

238
00:27:54,807 --> 00:27:57,420
Yes, that's Lonergan, boss.

239
00:28:01,238 --> 00:28:04,898
That's the son of a bitch who
stole my gold, off the coach.

240
00:28:04,898 --> 00:28:06,393
I want that man.

241
00:28:06,393 --> 00:28:08,829
You're gonna have to take it
up with the judge in Santa Fe.

242
00:28:08,829 --> 00:28:12,779
I ain't going to Santa Fe.
You give him to me now.

243
00:28:13,163 --> 00:28:14,652
Or I'm gonna take him.

244
00:28:14,652 --> 00:28:17,896
-What about me, pa?
-I said shut up, boy.

245
00:28:56,606 --> 00:28:58,999
What the hell is that?

246
00:29:17,812 --> 00:29:20,103
What the hell ...?

247
00:30:04,197 --> 00:30:06,564
-It's coming back!
-He's coming around.

248
00:30:06,715 --> 00:30:08,591
Giu 'horses!

249
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:25,964
-Do not move.
-Wait for me.

250
00:30:37,855 --> 00:30:39,232
-Give me your hand.
-What's going on?

251
00:30:39,232 --> 00:30:41,142
-Give me your hand.
-What the hell for?

252
00:30:41,142 --> 00:30:44,392
I'll get us free.
Give me your hand.

253
00:31:03,373 --> 00:31:06,700
Emmett. Come to me,
strong son.

254
00:31:08,634 --> 00:31:10,354
Grandpa!

255
00:31:13,566 --> 00:31:15,492
-Gimme your hand.
-No

256
00:31:15,754 --> 00:31:17,904
Come on, kid. Give me your hand.

257
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:35,065
What is that?

258
00:32:03,096 --> 00:32:04,660
Get up, boss.

259
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:07,447
-Come on, we gotta get out of here.
-Where's Percy?

260
00:32:11,315 --> 00:32:14,548
-Come out of there.
-I can't, pa. -Can't?

261
00:32:14,847 --> 00:32:16,735
Coward.

262
00:34:32,821 --> 00:34:35,456
-What is that thing?
-Why are you asking me?

263
00:34:35,944 --> 00:34:37,959
Since you shot us.

264
00:34:38,702 --> 00:34:41,578
-Where did you get this thing?
-I do not know.

265
00:34:43,358 --> 00:34:45,933
What do you mean you do not know?

266
00:34:51,778 --> 00:34:54,125
What the hell '?

267
00:34:55,734 --> 00:34:57,753
It took my wife.

268
00:35:01,413 --> 00:35:03,229
Hey!

269
00:35:03,229 --> 00:35:05,573
Is anyone in there?

270
00:35:06,052 --> 00:35:08,506
-No. -Is my wife in there?
-No!

271
00:35:08,607 --> 00:35:09,507
No!

272
00:35:10,084 --> 00:35:12,259
And 'dead?

273
00:35:21,174 --> 00:35:23,954
- It 'a demon?
- A demon?

274
00:35:24,201 --> 00:35:27,189
Can't rightly say. Sure does
fit the description but uh...

275
00:35:27,189 --> 00:35:29,097
Demons? What are you talking
about? Bible stuff -demons?

276
00:35:29,198 --> 00:35:31,498
- It 's like in the Bible?
- Of the demons?

277
00:35:30,697 --> 00:35:33,033
-I'm not talking about anything.
-What the hell are you talking about?

278
00:35:33,033 --> 00:35:35,464
- Calm down, Doc
- Calm?

279
00:35:35,464 --> 00:35:38,106
You're telling me that a bunch of demons took my wife?

280
00:35:38,106 --> 00:35:41,181
-I didn't say any such thing.
-Took our people.....

281
00:36:04,416 --> 00:36:05,979
Chief!

282
00:36:06,404 --> 00:36:09,552
Boss, it went this way.

283
00:36:13,159 --> 00:36:15,826
I do not know what it is, but it's bleeding.

284
00:36:18,727 --> 00:36:22,761
It's in the same direction those
machines went with our kin.

285
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:25,889
We're not gonna be able
to track it in the dark.

286
00:36:27,717 --> 00:36:31,455
Round up the horses,  get some supplies.
We set off first light.

287
00:36:32,745 --> 00:36:34,239
And you ...

288
00:36:35,623 --> 00:36:38,038
...You're going with us.

289
00:36:38,299 --> 00:36:41,277
I need that weapon, it's
the only thing that counts.

290
00:36:41,277 --> 00:36:44,238
I figure you owe me.

291
00:36:44,946 --> 00:36:47,348
I don't see it that way.

292
00:37:57,621 --> 00:37:59,489
What do you want?

293
00:37:59,681 --> 00:38:01,615
What do you want?

294
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:05,024
Just tell me right now, or I'll kill you.

295
00:38:05,024 --> 00:38:07,247
They took my people, too.

296
00:38:07,247 --> 00:38:09,843
I've been looking for them a long time.

297
00:38:09,843 --> 00:38:12,139
I know you can help me find them.

298
00:38:15,070 --> 00:38:17,950
You stay away from me.

299
00:38:28,157 --> 00:38:30,360
I can help you.

300
00:38:38,244 --> 00:38:40,435
It's heading north.

301
00:38:41,149 --> 00:38:43,232
It's tracks are still fresh.

302
00:38:55,879 --> 00:38:58,743
-If it's all the same, I'd ride along too.
-Yes, ma'am.

303
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:04,075
We got a kid and a dog,
why not a woman.

304
00:39:50,229 --> 00:39:52,793
You're back.

305
00:40:07,744 --> 00:40:09,876
What is that?

306
00:40:25,922 --> 00:40:29,888
-you have to take it back.
-Like hell I will. 

307
00:40:30,124 --> 00:40:31,273
-That's blood money.

308
00:40:31,273 --> 00:40:34,038
-Well I didn't goddamn harm anyone.
-By robbing and killing.

309
00:40:34,038 --> 00:40:36,510
That's gonna get us what we need.  

310 
00:41:08,595 --> 00:41:10,876
Jake. -Stay there.
-Jake.

311
00:41:36,478 --> 00:41:41,078
<i> www.celebritysex.tk </ i>

312
00:41:43,479 --> 00:41:45,392
Well, well, well.

313
00:41:45,492 --> 00:41:47,512
See who's' back.

314
00:41:48,142 --> 00:41:50,405
I'm seeing you, but I don't see my gold.

315
00:41:51,032 --> 00:41:53,669
Well let's say we find
those people first huh?

316
00:41:53,777 --> 00:41:56,374
And then you can take your
best shot at collecting.

317
00:41:56,374 --> 00:42:00,404
Maybe that reward on your head would
be a more attractive proposition.

318
00:42:00,404 --> 00:42:05,160
Or I could just shoot you in the chest
and cut that thing off your arm.

319
00:42:06,251 --> 00:42:09,330
You know Doc, I don't even
know why we're doing this.

320
00:42:09,791 --> 00:42:12,104
You know, they're all dead.

321
00:42:12,872 --> 00:42:16,307
Well, if think if they wanted to
kill 'em I think they would have.

322
00:42:16,307 --> 00:42:20,173
Well if.. if the boss is right,
they was roping 'em...

323
00:42:21,033 --> 00:42:23,161
...then it's to eat 'em.

324
00:42:24,128 --> 00:42:26,776
If it's me, I'd start with your wife.

325
00:42:29,465 --> 00:42:30,911
Are you gonna be like this the whole trip?

326
00:42:30,911 --> 00:42:34,757
we would
this conversation, right?

327
00:42:35,085 --> 00:42:37,868
You know, you could say that
do you mind or ...

328
00:42:37,868 --> 00:42:40,814
Cook some beans. Do something useful..

329
00:42:50,115 --> 00:42:52,348
Want some friendly advice?

330
00:42:53,731 --> 00:42:56,666
You get yourself a gun,
and learn how to use it.

331
00:43:05,176 --> 00:43:07,572
Tracks are washed away.

332
00:43:37,073 --> 00:43:39,244
I dont know much about boats...

333
00:43:39,481 --> 00:43:42,634
...but I'd say that one is upside-down.

334
00:43:43,089 --> 00:43:46,677
Five hundred miles from any river,
big enough to hold it.

335
00:43:47,328 --> 00:43:49,444
Well let's get inside,
get out of the rain.

336
00:43:49,444 --> 00:43:51,567
I'm not going anywhere near that thing.

337
00:43:51,567 --> 00:43:54,678
Suit yourself.
Sleep in the rain.

338
00:44:24,638 --> 00:44:27,092
You're fixin' to say something?

339
00:44:28,355 --> 00:44:32,850
Maybe ... maybe we should
have call the army?

340
00:44:32,850 --> 00:44:35,406
I ain't going to turn this
over to no WestPointers

341
00:44:35,406 --> 00:44:39,259
gotta get on the telegraph, ask
Washington which hand to wipe with.

342
00:44:39,907 --> 00:44:43,531
we waited around to ...
for them to tell me what to do.

343
00:44:45,538 --> 00:44:48,535
For this reason,
I lost 328 people.

344
00:44:48,757 --> 00:44:51,178
over a cornfield.

345
00:44:51,959 --> 00:44:55,171
I remember those stories.

346
00:44:57,517 --> 00:45:00,852
I don't recollect telling
you any stories.

347
00:45:01,238 --> 00:45:05,547
I'd listened when you tell them to Percy.

348
00:45:05,976 --> 00:45:10,021
You get this through
your thick Indian skull...

349
00:45:12,082 --> 00:45:15,791
The stories weren't for you.

350
00:45:17,237 --> 00:45:19,985
They were for my son.

351
00:45:22,158 --> 00:45:26,191
Get out of here.
Go to take care of horses.

352
00:45:26,484 --> 00:45:28,903
It 'your work.

353
00:46:06,785 --> 00:46:10,221
Were you watching this knife, right?
Preview

354
00:46:23,451 --> 00:46:26,220
Keep it to account.

355
00:46:27,735 --> 00:46:29,883
Do not miss it.

356
00:46:37,792 --> 00:46:40,687
Do not beat him!
It's not 'not your pack!

357
00:46:41,292 --> 00:46:44,104
Remember that your life
depends on weapon.

358
00:46:48,476 --> 00:46:50,562
What the hell am I doing?

359
00:46:53,417 --> 00:46:57,048
It 'my fault, if those
flying machines have taken.

360
00:46:57,048 --> 00:46:59,135
No, no, no.
It's not 'your fault.

361
00:46:59,255 --> 00:47:03,122
The will report back.
Andra 'all right. You just have faith.

362
00:47:03,238 --> 00:47:04,596
Faith?

363
00:47:04,596 --> 00:47:07,311
Well, I do not think
that could serve ...

364
00:47:07,311 --> 00:47:10,764
I will not disrespect,
father, and the Lord but I do not get along,

365
00:47:10,864 --> 00:47:12,848
and I do not like me very much.

366
00:47:12,848 --> 00:47:16,786
Surely you do not expect Doc
God does everything for you, right?

367
00:47:17,972 --> 00:47:20,459
His presence,
you, you have to earn.

368
00:47:20,545 --> 00:47:22,029
Then, you will recognize,

369
00:47:22,135 --> 00:47:24,196
and then you
behave properly.

370
00:47:25,759 --> 00:47:28,203
So, take aim
of that target ...

371
00:47:29,429 --> 00:47:31,187
and shoots.

372
00:47:36,935 --> 00:47:39,294
So 'it's better. Come on.

373
00:47:39,394 --> 00:47:41,173
Again.

374
00:48:02,582 --> 00:48:04,654
You are there 'long?

375
00:48:04,849 --> 00:48:06,587
It '.

376
00:48:16,999 --> 00:48:19,083
You need something?

377
00:48:19,658 --> 00:48:21,996
Who are you '?

378
00:48:24,537 --> 00:48:29,082
- It 'the only one who knows who they are.
- You know who you are.

379
00:48:29,599 --> 00:48:32,305
- You just have to remember it.
- I can not ...

380
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:34,890
It ', as you can.

381
00:48:49,826 --> 00:48:51,887
Does it hurt?

382
00:48:54,630 --> 00:48:56,713
Is not 'nothing.

383
00:49:04,116 --> 00:49:05,985
And 'here.

384
00:49:43,639 --> 00:49:46,086
Calm dog.
Calm down.

385
00:49:46,086 --> 00:49:48,062
What 'happened?

386
00:49:48,062 --> 00:49:50,361
There 'no?

387
00:51:17,120 --> 00:51:19,021
Stay away from the boy!

388
00:51:22,869 --> 00:51:24,467
No!

389
00:51:52,461 --> 00:51:54,436
- The boy! The boy ...
- He's fine ...

390
00:51:56,655 --> 00:51:58,992
It's all right.

391
00:52:02,234 --> 00:52:04,899
You must bring
those people back.

392
00:52:06,970 --> 00:52:09,666
And I'll tell 'you something, son.

393
00:52:09,938 --> 00:52:12,840
I know who you are ...

394
00:52:41,867 --> 00:52:43,741
Dog?

395
00:52:44,441 --> 00:52:46,522
Come on, come on!

396
00:52:47,773 --> 00:52:49,851
So where are you?

397
00:52:52,085 --> 00:52:54,072
Excellent track
north.

398
00:52:54,265 --> 00:52:58,336
- Where are the men?
- They ran. Damned cowards.

399
00:52:58,336 --> 00:52:59,812
I can not find the dog.

400
00:52:59,812 --> 00:53:03,746
I do not expect.
O 'and ran or' dead. Come on.

401
00:53:03,746 --> 00:53:07,752
Hey, hey, wait.
I would like to say a few words ...

402
00:53:07,752 --> 00:53:10,380
The only one who could say
something 'buried.

403
00:53:10,843 --> 00:53:13,417
It is not 'enough time
and we 'wanted to bury him?

404
00:53:13,417 --> 00:53:15,726
No, not 'enough.

405
00:53:27,434 --> 00:53:29,268
Say well ...

406
00:53:33,479 --> 00:53:35,498
God ...

407
00:53:37,692 --> 00:53:40,603
if there is one thing
called soul ...

408
00:53:40,790 --> 00:53:43,045
this man had.
Please protect it.

409
00:53:43,757 --> 00:53:47,426
It helped me feel better.
And now and 'in a better place.

410
00:53:48,005 --> 00:53:50,614
Dust to dust.
Amen. How did he go?

411
00:53:50,854 --> 00:53:52,945
Fine words.

412
00:54:02,708 --> 00:54:05,124
Boy, 'cause you're coming with us?

413
00:54:07,175 --> 00:54:09,291
I'm worried about my grandfather.

414
00:54:14,483 --> 00:54:18,798
Well, when I was a little more '
greater than you,

415
00:54:19,180 --> 00:54:21,520
this,
was Mexico.

416
00:54:22,785 --> 00:54:26,904
We were aware that the Apache
would attack a colony called

417
00:54:26,904 --> 00:54:29,138
... Jiruaca.

418
00:54:30,004 --> 00:54:31,857
My father wanted
I was a man ...

419
00:54:31,857 --> 00:54:35,828
then I bring 'with him
to make me go to bed with a woman.

420
00:54:38,094 --> 00:54:40,535
I was terrified ...

421
00:54:43,058 --> 00:54:45,552
When we arrived, it was too late.
They were all dead.

422
00:54:45,552 --> 00:54:48,001
The flames had
destroyed everything.

423
00:54:48,959 --> 00:54:51,552
Then we saw a man ...

424
00:54:52,227 --> 00:54:55,480
crawling out of
from a burning building ...

425
00:54:56,808 --> 00:54:58,898
It was burned ...

426
00:54:59,321 --> 00:55:01,643
He knew he was dying.

427
00:55:02,510 --> 00:55:04,765
He was severely burned ...

428
00:55:06,494 --> 00:55:08,554
Yes and 'turned to me ...

429
00:55:09,114 --> 00:55:11,706
and I looked in my eyes

430
00:55:12,458 --> 00:55:15,574
and he said: "Kill me."

431
00:55:17,779 --> 00:55:19,984
And what have you done?

432
00:55:24,624 --> 00:55:27,729
I pulled out this knife
from his belt,

433
00:55:28,279 --> 00:55:31,031
and I cut his throat.

434
00:55:32,502 --> 00:55:34,527
Take it.

435
00:55:37,490 --> 00:55:39,666
Be a man.

436
00:55:48,470 --> 00:55:50,813
It 'been a little' hard, right?

437
00:55:51,372 --> 00:55:53,402
You can say that again.

438
00:56:07,664 --> 00:56:11,188
There we are.
The tracks are more 'frequent.

439
00:56:11,420 --> 00:56:14,189
He slowed down, and and '
directed in the throat.

440
00:56:35,374 --> 00:56:37,653
Hands up!

441
00:56:40,247 --> 00:56:42,986
Also applies to you, young lady.

442
00:56:44,588 --> 00:56:46,961
As they say: Hello!

443
00:56:47,086 --> 00:56:49,133
Welcome to all.

444
00:56:49,159 --> 00:56:50,931
Welcome.

445
00:56:54,642 --> 00:56:57,193
Head?

446
00:56:57,245 --> 00:56:59,497
Chief, are you?

447
00:57:00,502 --> 00:57:04,326
Lonergan, what the hell
are you doing here?

448
00:57:06,456 --> 00:57:08,183
Chief!

449
00:57:08,872 --> 00:57:11,978
Who are your friends?

450
00:57:14,054 --> 00:57:16,708
And 'your new gang?

451
00:57:20,196 --> 00:57:23,151
I did not think I would
more 'revised, Jake.

452
00:57:25,449 --> 00:57:28,025
You were always my favorite.

453
00:57:28,412 --> 00:57:30,190
Silence.

454
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,593
Jake, I've broken a tooth?

455
00:57:35,703 --> 00:57:38,282
Do you want to shut up!
I'm thinking!

456
00:57:41,774 --> 00:57:44,138
How many were boys?

457
00:57:45,199 --> 00:57:47,563
More 'or less the same.

458
00:57:48,391 --> 00:57:52,594
- What would be ...?
- Thirty?

459
00:57:52,594 --> 00:57:56,721
Exactly! Thirty.
Excellent.

460
00:57:58,867 --> 00:58:00,501
Excellent.

461
00:58:01,671 --> 00:58:04,527
Scortateci the field.

462
00:58:06,213 --> 00:58:08,913
We need to fix things.

463
00:58:10,499 --> 00:58:12,866
Let's go to camp!

464
00:58:13,253 --> 00:58:15,734
- What have we?
- Gold nuggets.

465
00:58:15,834 --> 00:58:17,899

Do you have the courage ...

472
00:58:47,699 --> 00:58:51,379
You'll come here, as if
nothing had happened.

473
00:58:51,885 --> 00:58:55,523
Guys, take your guns.
Here we go.

474
00:58:56,342 --> 00:58:59,223
No one will go 'anywhere
part with you, Jack.

475
00:59:00,423 --> 00:59:02,813
We prepared
an assault on the coach ...

476
00:59:02,918 --> 00:59:05,777
and e 'exactly
what 'we intend to do.

477
00:59:12,806 --> 00:59:15,005
Are you the whore?

478
00:59:15,301 --> 00:59:17,040
Who?

479
00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:20,722
The tart that Jake
has left the gang.

480
00:59:21,151 --> 00:59:23,823
- Be careful what you say.
- Or what?

481
00:59:24,696 --> 00:59:27,569
Now I'm in command.

482
00:59:27,569 --> 00:59:29,070
Point your guns
the bitch!

483
00:59:29,070 --> 00:59:33,285
If only one of them moves,
let them blow your brains.

484
00:59:36,811 --> 00:59:39,495
He said the tramp.

485
00:59:40,163 --> 00:59:43,699
Call her again "whore"
and will be 'the last word you say.

486
00:59:43,699 --> 00:59:46,952
You're in no position

487
00:59:47,421 --> 00:59:49,717
Hunte, take his gun.

00:59:49,717 --> 00:59:51,995
Take his gun.

Where 'our gold, Jake?

491

01:00:27,460 --> 01:00:29,436
But I remember it well ...

493
01:00:29,613 --> 01:00:33,495
you've decided to forget
us for someone else!

494
01:00:44,802 --> 01:00:50,397
I guess I wanted svigartela
with all the gold in the last shot, right?

495
01:00:51,472 --> 01:00:54,085
You'll ask '

I said, throw your arms!

505
01:01:54,496 --> 01:01:56,158

Are you okay?

517
01:05:25,534 --> 01:05:27,375

She remains with me.

01:07:27,433 --> 01:07:31,622
- Can you tell me that.
- I can not remember.

527
01:07:32,217 --> 01:07:33,883
Practically nothing.

528
01:07:34,599 --> 01:07:36,846
Everything I know,
and 'that are in her debt.

529
01:07:37,562 --> 01:07:40,096
And I must find.

530
01:07:42,598 --> 01:07:45,731
Sorry ... I'm sorry.

531
01:07:47,173 --> 01:07:50,707
I'll hold ... I'll hold you.

532
01:07:55,354 --> 01:07:57,335
Not long.

533
01:07:59,245 --> 01:08:00,751
You and I ...

534
01:08:01,899 --> 01:08:04,502
we'll get along.

535
01:08:11,517 --> 01:08:14,616
And 'Lonergan?

536
01:08:15,152 --> 01:08:16,909
Chief!

537
01:08:26,187 --> 01:08:29,511
- I'll take care.
- Put giu '.

538
01:08:34,466 --> 01:08:38,449
- Drink.
- No, give it to her.

539
01:08:48,050 --> 01:08:50,152
Doc?

540
01:09:00,712 --> 01:09:02,698
How are you?

541
01:09:04,568 --> 01:09:07,644
- It 'dead ...
- No ...

542
01:09:09,325 --> 01:09:13,510
It is not 'dead.
It is not 'dead!

543
01:09:14,230 --> 01:09:16,525
Jake.

544
01:09:17,164 --> 01:09:19,312
He's' gone ...

545
01:09:54,072 --> 01:09:56,111
- Doc ...
- Do not worry.

546
01:09:56,411 --> 01:09:58,336
Doc!

547
01:10:33,229 --> 01:10:35,906
E '"Black Knife".

548
01:10:36,871 --> 01:10:39,524
And 'what the head of' that
and 'left of his people.

549
01:10:39,524 --> 01:10:42,803
We must listen.
Lest we die!

550
01:10:42,803 --> 01:10:44,367
The last Chiricahua!

551
01:10:45,314 --> 01:10:49,163
He said that the white led
the destruction of his people.

552
01:10:49,163 --> 01:10:51,876
Not 'true. We were
here before them.

553
01:10:51,876 --> 01:10:53,088
They have come here.

554
01:10:53,088 --> 01:10:55,547
He said that we were
us to bring the monsters.

555
01:10:55,547 --> 01:10:59,712
We? They also kidnapped our
people. They took my wife!

556
01:10:59,968 --> 01:11:03,047
- Tell him he kidnapped my wife!
- It's not 'a good reason.

557
01:12:11,831 --> 01:12:14,801
I'm sorry, I could not tell you.

558
01:12:15,049 --> 01:12:17,283
- Are you one of them?
- No.

559
01:12:17,405 --> 01:12:19,725
I come from another world.

560
01:12:19,820 --> 01:12:22,673
I have taken this form,
to stand among you.

561
01:12:24,191 --> 01:12:25,883
You should have said.

562
01:12:25,883 --> 01:12:28,714
You could not
take care of the old body ...

563
01:12:28,714 --> 01:12:31,290
even if he was alive.

564
01:12:42,119 --> 01:12:44,932
You may ask where it came from?

565
01:12:54,620 --> 01:12:59,544
- What did he say?
- What is a world beyond the stars.

566
01:12:59,544 --> 01:13:03,509
What do you mean from another world?
What do you mean by "other world"?

567
01:13:03,509 --> 01:13:05,932
- What's up '?
- He says you should not talk.

568
01:13:05,932 --> 01:13:07,557
What do you say that
should I speak? I have some questions to ask her!

569
01:13:08,835 --> 01:13:10,963
- You are a guest!
- I'm not a guest!

570
01:13:10,963 --> 01:13:13,201
I thought I was a prisoner.

571
01:13:13,591 --> 01:13:15,749
You are both great men,
great warriors.

572
01:13:15,749 --> 01:13:19,054
Therefore, we must listen to that
says the woman, whatever.

573
01:13:19,054 --> 01:13:20,565
What are they doing here?

574
01:13:20,605 --> 01:13:22,628
They wanted gold.

575
01:13:24,573 --> 01:13:27,960
But it 'ridiculous.
What the hell are they doing? We buy anything?

576
01:13:28,217 --> 01:13:30,928
For them and 'rare
as it is' for you.

577
01:13:31,146 --> 01:13:33,052
- And my grandfather?
- And my wife.

578
01:13:33,052 --> 01:13:36,674
And all the others.
Are they still alive?

579
01:13:36,674 --> 01:13:38,935
If and 'so',
not be for long.

580
01:13:40,846 --> 01:13:42,956
They are considering
your weaknesses.

581
01:13:43,238 --> 01:13:45,115
These are only the scouts.

582
01:13:45,115 --> 01:13:47,082
If we let them live,
will return with many others,

583
01:13:47,082 --> 01:13:49,740
and no one will survive '.

584
01:13:50,491 --> 01:13:52,650
And 'what' and that 'successful
to my people.

585
01:13:52,650 --> 01:13:55,325
I came here,
to you 'that does not happen again.

586
01:13:55,325 --> 01:13:57,941
But we must work together.

587
01:14:04,088 --> 01:14:07,151
He said that his men
will join her.

588
01:14:07,151 --> 01:14:09,977
In what sense do you join?
What will they do? Where will they go?

589
01:14:09,977 --> 01:14:12,415
We can find them.
He knows where they are.

590
01:14:16,445 --> 01:14:18,429
No, not 'true.

591
01:14:19,173 --> 01:14:22,383
I can not remember anything.
Not even my name.

592
01:14:25,846 --> 01:14:28,777
He said that
will occupy them.

593
01:16:53,387 --> 01:16:58,661
I brought home the gold.

594
01:16:59,657 --> 01:17:02,595
And then they kidnapped.

595
01:17:02,747 --> 01:17:05,437
It's not 'your fault.

596
01:18:14,166 --> 01:18:16,661
I know where they are.

597
01:19:02,922 --> 01:19:05,328
Blessed Virgin Mary.

598
01:19:07,061 --> 01:19:10,398
- How did they build such a thing?
- We have come with that ...

599
01:19:10,487 --> 01:19:12,449
And 'their spaceship.

600
01:19:12,449 --> 01:19:16,365
That and 'just the tip.
The rest 'underground. They are looking for gold.

601
01:19:16,365 --> 01:19:18,752
And 'so', here is' gold.

602
01:19:19,072 --> 01:19:21,022
We can see?

603
01:19:21,022 --> 01:19:22,761
We do not see very well,
in the light of day.

604
01:19:22,761 --> 01:19:26,002
By day they hide
in caves, where's 'more' dark.

605
01:19:56,133 --> 01:19:57,852
That's it!

606
01:19:57,852 --> 01:20:01,404
We're fried. We take
all, closer than before.

607
01:20:01,404 --> 01:20:04,020
No, there 'another way.

608
01:20:04,020 --> 01:20:07,714
Over there '. From where I ran.

609
01:20:09,603 --> 01:20:12,581
We need to attract outside
creatures ...

610
01:20:12,659 --> 01:20:14,532
so ', we
to approach.

611
01:20:14,860 --> 01:20:18,773
And you shall go with that thing
you have the arm, freeing our people.

612
01:20:19,903 --> 01:20:23,050
We have an advantage.
You underestimate.

613
01:20:23,153 --> 01:20:25,094
They are like insects.

614
01:20:25,094 --> 01:20:28,716
I'm not ready for defense
so they are vulnerable.

615
01:20:29,144 --> 01:20:32,875
- Do not have enough men.
- I go for a walk.

616
01:20:37,337 --> 01:20:40,557
He said he would like
use your telescope.

617
01:21:06,628 --> 01:21:09,252
The Apaches are warriors
Mountain ...

618
01:21:09,435 --> 01:21:12,739
He says it would be better
attack from a hill.

619
01:21:14,830 --> 01:21:16,326
And tell him that 'a fool.

620
01:21:16,326 --> 01:21:19,460
There 'hill that takes,
with those flying machines!

621
01:21:19,550 --> 01:21:21,728
Jake is going on.

622
01:21:28,655 --> 01:21:30,197
We are at the last stop ...

623
01:21:30,197 --> 01:21:32,792
Bastard.

624
01:21:35,355 --> 01:21:38,424
- How much gold do we have?
- Not much.

625
01:21:38,624 --> 01:21:43,041
But I want my side now,
to leave the most 'far as possible.

626
01:21:45,734 --> 01:21:48,950
- Red?!
- I gunpoint, boss.

627
01:21:54,854 --> 01:21:58,131
Boy, have I at my
a deal that you can not refuse.

628
01:21:59,656 --> 01:22:01,663
Going somewhere?

629
01:22:04,412 --> 01:22:06,626
The most 'far as possible.

630
01:22:06,626 --> 01:22:10,187
- Remember the beach in Puerto Vallarta?
- There are big fish.

631
01:22:10,961 --> 01:22:13,705
Good tequila.
Want to come with us?

632
01:22:13,705 --> 01:22:15,767
It makes no difference.

633
01:22:17,047 --> 01:22:19,231
Not be able to
go very far.

634
01:22:20,875 --> 01:22:23,325
What are those things, Jake?

635
01:22:23,619 --> 01:22:26,802
No matter ...
we would find.

636
01:22:27,427 --> 01:22:29,640
Would kill us all.

637
01:22:29,919 --> 01:22:32,171
What the hell are you talking about?

638
01:22:33,038 --> 01:22:35,612
The important thing 'that
you have a choice.

639
01:22:36,409 --> 01:22:39,178
You could spend the last
hours that remain, drunk on the beach ...

640
01:22:39,178 --> 01:22:43,204
which, however,
and 'a good idea ...

641
01:22:43,919 --> 01:22:46,902
or you can follow me,
one last time.

642
01:22:57,328 --> 01:23:00,427
We must make the best use
the latest resources.

643
01:23:00,427 --> 01:23:03,516
We need a strategy.
Listen to me, dammit!

644
01:23:04,555 --> 01:23:07,772
They do not understand anything.
You have to explain it to you.

645
01:23:07,929 --> 01:23:11,221
Listen, we can not run around
here and the ', hurling spears

646
01:23:11,221 --> 01:23:14,924
and firing arrows,
those damn creatures!

647
01:23:14,925 --> 01:23:18,955
We need to flush them out from the 'inside!
On open ground.

648
01:23:18,955 --> 01:23:22,461
So 'we will surround
and attack from all sides.

649
01:23:22,461 --> 01:23:24,683
Destroy them!
Explain ...

650
01:23:28,473 --> 01:23:31,466
He said that will allow '
to control its people.

651
01:23:41,747 --> 01:23:43,804
What does it say?

652
01:23:45,169 --> 01:23:49,154
He said they should open their
hearts to understand his point of view.

653
01:23:55,035 --> 01:23:57,970
When his parents died
during the war in Mexico,

654
01:23:58,314 --> 01:24:01,161
you have taken with you,
when he was just a kid.

655
01:24:03,888 --> 01:24:06,561
You gave a purpose ...

656
01:24:06,642 --> 01:24:09,410
have taught the
to take care of itself.

657
01:24:09,410 --> 01:24:11,773
Even if it was your child.

658
01:24:16,266 --> 01:24:18,536
Who despise the war ...

659
01:24:22,815 --> 01:24:26,544
Whether you are a proud warrior ...
in any battle.

660
01:24:45,668 --> 01:24:47,643
He wonders why 'if you're
a great warrior ...

661
01:24:47,744 --> 01:24:51,244
have allowed a boy
and a woman will follow in the battle.

662
01:25:25,247 --> 01:25:26,796
Dog!

663
01:25:27,136 --> 01:25:28,568
Dog!

664
01:25:44,638 --> 01:25:46,681
What God is my lightning!

665
01:25:47,668 --> 01:25:50,283
Are you ready to bounce back
your son?

666
01:27:22,784 --> 01:27:24,486
Match ...

667
01:27:35,867 --> 01:27:38,946
I know that I was wrong,
But do not let me back down '...

668
01:27:38,946 --> 01:27:40,942
and climb again!

669
01:27:47,688 --> 01:27:49,884
Go!

670
01:28:03,183 --> 01:28:04,956
Hurry! Go!

671
01:28:44,335 --> 01:28:46,896
I think we destroyed!?

672
01:28:58,456 --> 01:29:00,480
They were under fire!

673
01:29:04,329 --> 01:29:06,224
Take it and hide
somewhere.

674
01:29:06,224 --> 01:29:08,047
- When you see our people, please advise!
- It ', sir.

675
01:29:08,047 --> 01:29:09,956
We move from here!

676
01:29:23,452 --> 01:29:25,178
Good job.

677
01:29:25,178 --> 01:29:28,132
Our people and 'still
the 'inside. We need to get them out.

678
01:29:28,704 --> 01:29:30,353
May God be with you.

679
01:29:31,137 --> 01:29:32,968
Let's go!

680
01:30:45,270 --> 01:30:48,035
That's where it goes' round
extract the gold.

681
01:31:12,341 --> 01:31:14,952
- They can not be killed.
- It 'instead!

682
01:31:14,952 --> 01:31:18,187
We must resist.
As long as' we do not save our people.

683
01:32:19,679 --> 01:32:21,450
Doc!

684
01:32:21,718 --> 01:32:24,150
Doc, come here, quick!

685
01:32:26,490 --> 01:32:28,424
Oh, Jesus' ...

686
01:32:30,432 --> 01:32:32,305
Doc!

687
01:32:32,943 --> 01:32:35,345
We killed a ...

It ', we have taken.

689
01:32:39,693 --> 01:32:44,725
You know, I always dreamed
to have a father like you ...

690
01:32:47,379 --> 01:32:50,697
And I've always dreamed
a son like you ...

691
01:32:54,273 --> 01:32:57,583
Go, Percy found ...

692
01:32:58,216 --> 01:33:00,913
Reclaim your child ...

693
01:34:28,532 --> 01:34:31,061
Do not look at the light ...

694
01:35:05,775 --> 01:35:08,563
- I told you not to look at the light!
- You were right.

695
01:35:28,159 --> 01:35:31,635
- How long does it take to recover?
- For each person, and 'different.

696
01:35:36,943 --> 01:35:39,944
- Tiriamoli out ...
- We must hurry.

697
01:36:20,194 --> 01:36:22,057
As others arrive!

698
01:36:57,618 --> 01:36:59,293
Go!

699
01:37:23,429 --> 01:37:25,176
They are all out.

700
01:37:25,607 --> 01:37:27,314
Well ...

701
01:37:28,130 --> 01:37:30,646
Hey, where are you going?

702
01:37:31,439 --> 01:37:33,600
Let's go this way!

703
01:38:23,263 --> 01:38:25,212
Dog, go!

704
01:39:59,875 --> 01:40:02,245
Where the hell are you going?
We need to get out of here!

705
01:40:02,245 --> 01:40:04,100
No!

706
01:40:04,900 --> 01:40:07,947
- I came here to destroy that thing!
- But how?

707
01:40:08,448 --> 01:40:12,398
- The bracelet ... Take it off.
- I can not remove it.

708
01:40:12,398 --> 01:40:14,783
- It 'as you can, it controls you.
- How?

709
01:40:14,783 --> 01:40:17,392
Like when you fire.
With the mind.

710
01:40:18,297 --> 01:40:20,962
You have to stop thinking about it ...

711
01:40:31,422 --> 01:40:33,252
It does not work.

712
01:40:48,388 --> 01:40:50,490
And 'dropped ...

713
01:40:59,655 --> 01:41:02,759
If I can achieve
the core, I'll be able 'to stop them.

714
01:41:05,391 --> 01:41:07,199
Come on.

715
01:41:18,441 --> 01:41:20,449
Take this.

716
01:41:45,812 --> 01:41:47,548
The bracelet!

717
01:41:52,373 --> 01:41:54,993
- Goodbye, Jake.
- What?

718
01:41:55,462 --> 01:41:57,795
What? No!

719
01:43:00,695 --> 01:43:05,032
I saw them.
They went out! That way!

720
01:43:05,032 --> 01:43:07,228
There 'also Percy?

721
01:43:10,532 --> 01:43:13,364
- It ', I see.
- And Jake and Ella?

722
01:43:13,586 --> 01:43:16,015
No, no!

723
01:46:14,619 --> 01:46:16,898
Everything ok?

724
01:46:25,717 --> 01:46:28,277
- Where 'the girl?
- It 'in!

725
01:48:59,833 --> 01:49:01,775
Grandpa!

726
01:49:02,201 --> 01:49:04,262
It's me.

727
01:49:05,774 --> 01:49:08,376
- Emmett.
- Emmett.

728
01:49:14,126 --> 01:49:16,570
You grew!

729
01:49:23,601 --> 01:49:25,606
Percy.

730
01:49:30,091 --> 01:49:32,905
Do not you remember me, boy?

731
01:49:33,213 --> 01:49:37,796
I'm sorry,
I do not remember much ...

732
01:49:38,336 --> 01:49:40,734
I am your father ...

733
01:49:41,008 --> 01:49:43,217
Oh!

734
01:49:53,181 --> 01:49:55,775
Do you remember me?

735
01:50:08,709 --> 01:50:11,981
I thought you were dead ...

736
01:51:54,411 --> 01:51:57,073
With gold, things
put it differently.

737
01:51:58,029 --> 01:52:00,815
Soon will come '
the railway ...

738
01:52:01,600 --> 01:52:04,276
Will change 'business
transport ...

739
01:52:06,705 --> 01:52:09,894
The recorder
accounts in the bank?

740
01:52:09,894 --> 01:52:12,843
And tell them, 'I want
the new checks.

741
01:52:13,286 --> 01:52:14,971
Ok.

742
01:52:16,443 --> 01:52:20,346
I would like it to be changed
the headline "Dolarhyde and Son."

743
01:52:23,433 --> 01:52:25,775
- What do you think?
- It '...

744
01:52:26,730 --> 01:52:28,912
It ', sir.

745
01:52:39,561 --> 01:52:42,685
- John ...
- Woodrow ...

746
01:52:43,910 --> 01:52:46,987
The city 'is becoming
more 'big ...

747
01:52:52,789 --> 01:52:56,041
Do not you'd go
without saying goodbye, right?

748
01:52:59,171 --> 01:53:01,490
I am a wanted criminal.

749
01:53:02,068 --> 01:53:07,293
I could swear that Lonergan and Jake '
died in those caves. True, sheriff?

750
01:53:07,293 --> 01:53:11,597
It 'a shame.
I could not wait to hang myself!

751
01:53:13,259 --> 01:53:16,607
- There 'need brav'uomini here.
- Sure ...

752
01:53:22,195 --> 01:53:24,404
Jake.

753
01:53:25,564 --> 01:53:28,294
She and 'in a better place ...

754
01:53:31,468 --> 01:53:34,076
See you, Colonel.

1
00:00:10,172 --> 00:00:16,333


2
00:01:04,076 --> 00:01:07,687
I have found almost everything
ever written about love...

3
00:01:07,883 --> 00:01:09,127
...to be true.

4
00:01:09,323 --> 00:01:13,185
Shakespeare said,
"Journeys end in lovers meeting."

5
00:01:13,387 --> 00:01:15,110
What an extraordinary thought.

6
00:01:15,306 --> 00:01:18,601
Personally, I have not experienced
anything remotely close to that...

7
00:01:18,794 --> 00:01:21,729
...but I'm more than willing to believe
Shakespeare had.

8
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:25,126
I suppose I think about love
more than anyone really should.

9
00:01:25,322 --> 00:01:30,537
I'm constantly amazed by its sheer
power to alter and define our lives.

10
00:01:30,794 --> 00:01:33,576
It was Shakespeare who also said,
"Love is blind."

11
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:38,664
Now, that is something
I know to be true.

12
00:01:50,024 --> 00:01:53,472
For some, quite inexplicably...

13
00:01:54,216 --> 00:01:55,710
...love fades.

14
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:11,300
For others...

15
00:02:11,495 --> 00:02:13,502
...love is simply lost.

16
00:02:19,047 --> 00:02:23,040
But then, of course,
love can also be found.

17
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:26,237
Even if just for the night.

18
00:02:31,045 --> 00:02:33,118
And then there'
another kind of love.

19
00:02:33,317 --> 00:02:34,692
The cruelest kind.

20
00:02:34,885 --> 00:02:37,503
The one that almost kills its victims.

21
00:02:37,701 --> 00:02:40,418
It' called unrequited love.

22
00:02:40,613 --> 00:02:44,541
Of that, I am an expert.

23
00:02:45,061 --> 00:02:48,704
Most love stories are about people
who fall in love with each other.

24
00:02:48,901 --> 00:02:52,096
But what about the rest of us?
What about our stories?

25
00:02:52,293 --> 00:02:54,593
Those of us who fall in love alone.

26
00:02:55,172 --> 00:02:57,725
We are the victims
of the one-sided affair.

27
00:02:57,923 --> 00:02:59,712
We are the cursed
of the loved ones.

28
00:02:59,908 --> 00:03:02,558
We are the unloved ones.
The walking wounded.

29
00:03:02,755 --> 00:03:06,072
The handicapped without the
advantage of a great parking space.

30
00:03:06,306 --> 00:03:08,641
Yes, you are looking at one
such individual.

31
00:03:08,834 --> 00:03:10,777
And I have willingly loved...

32
00:03:10,979 --> 00:03:14,623
...that man for over
three miserable years.

33
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:17,022
The absolute worst years of my life.

34
00:03:17,218 --> 00:03:19,258
The worst Christmases,
the worst birthdays.

35
00:03:19,458 --> 00:03:22,970
New Year' Eves brought in
by tears and Valium.

36
00:03:23,171 --> 00:03:26,999
These years I've been in love have
been the darkest days of my life...

37
00:03:27,202 --> 00:03:30,267
...all because I'm cursed by being
in love with a man who does not...

38
00:03:30,465 --> 00:03:32,701
...and will not love me back.

39
00:03:32,897 --> 00:03:34,391
Oh, God, just the sight of him.

40
00:03:34,592 --> 00:03:37,941
Heart pounding, throat thickening,
absolutely can't swallow.

41
00:03:38,145 --> 00:03:40,698
All the usual symptoms.

42
00:03:40,897 --> 00:03:42,555
Oh, Jasper.

43
00:03:42,752 --> 00:03:47,029
- Don't tell me you're still...
- No, no, no, that's over. Very over.

44
00:03:47,232 --> 00:03:50,363
What's the story with you two anyway?
You were shagging him, werert you?

45
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,948
More importantly, I was in love
with him, truth be known.

46
00:03:53,152 --> 00:03:56,664
Then you found out he was shagging
that drip from Circulation.

47
00:03:56,864 --> 00:03:58,805
Which is when I stopped
shagging him.

48
00:03:59,007 --> 00:04:01,308
We shouldn't be talking
about this at the office party.

49
00:04:01,504 --> 00:04:03,772
But I always see you two together.

50
00:04:03,967 --> 00:04:06,618
He cheated on you,
but you stayed friends?

51
00:04:07,038 --> 00:04:11,610
I was head over heels, you know?
Everyone knew.

52
00:04:11,807 --> 00:04:14,490
- Does it look like I'm crying right now?
- No, no, no.

53
00:04:14,687 --> 00:04:17,501
No, it just looks like it's the smoke
from my cigarette.

54
00:04:18,334 --> 00:04:21,084
Did he ever actually tell you
that he loved you back?

55
00:04:21,277 --> 00:04:25,368
Yes. Three, almost four times.
And when I reminded him of that...

56
00:04:25,566 --> 00:04:27,802
...he said it must have been an answer
to a question.

57
00:04:27,996 --> 00:04:31,193
Which, by the way,
it absolutely was not.

58
00:04:31,389 --> 00:04:35,349
You know, Iris, when you catch
your guy with another woman...

59
00:04:35,549 --> 00:04:37,556
...you're not supposed
to stay friends with him.

60
00:04:37,756 --> 00:04:39,764
You're supposed to never
talk to the prick again.

61
00:04:39,965 --> 00:04:43,096
You're supposed to throw things
at him, scream, call him names.

62
00:04:43,293 --> 00:04:44,787
Not do his blooming laundry.

63
00:04:44,988 --> 00:04:46,417
I don't do his laundry.

64
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:49,271
Did someone tell you
I do his laundry?

65
00:04:50,204 --> 00:04:51,578
No, no, all we do now is...

66
00:04:52,059 --> 00:04:54,165
...we e-mail.

67
00:04:54,364 --> 00:04:55,924
Not when he's with her, of course.

68
00:04:56,123 --> 00:04:59,571
Also when he's not with her,
we talk on the phone.

69
00:04:59,772 --> 00:05:03,994
Sometimes for hours. And then
there's the occasional long lunch.

70
00:05:04,187 --> 00:05:06,870
You know, I never realized
how pathetic you are.

71
00:05:07,066 --> 00:05:08,528
Really?

72
00:05:08,987 --> 00:05:11,801
Oh, God. I'm so aware of it.

73
00:05:11,994 --> 00:05:14,296
They always know just
how to get us, don't they?

74
00:05:14,681 --> 00:05:16,569
He knows whenever he wants
back in your life...

75
00:05:16,762 --> 00:05:19,663
Actually, he has made some small
comments like that recently.

76
00:05:19,866 --> 00:05:21,753
He hasn't exactly come
right out and said it...

77
00:05:21,946 --> 00:05:23,768
Iris, did you file your story?

78
00:05:23,962 --> 00:05:28,217
Oh, no, not yet.
Down to the wire. Sorry.

79
00:05:28,793 --> 00:05:30,102
Better go.

80
00:05:32,569 --> 00:05:35,700
- Groom's best friend spoke...

81
00:05:35,897 --> 00:05:40,272
...for many guests
when he said, "Hilary...

82
00:05:41,593 --> 00:05:44,211
...will open Edward's eyes...

83
00:05:44,408 --> 00:05:47,637
...and round out his life."

84
00:05:47,831 --> 00:05:50,319
Okay, I've got a question for you.

85
00:05:54,072 --> 00:05:56,374
What's it like to be the only one
committed to work...

86
00:05:56,567 --> 00:05:58,061
...while the rest of us
are slumming?

87
00:05:58,264 --> 00:06:00,151
You mean what's it like
to be the only one...

88
00:06:00,343 --> 00:06:02,066
...not to finish their work on time?

89
00:06:02,264 --> 00:06:04,784
Hold on. Don't... Don't go.

90
00:06:05,335 --> 00:06:07,701
Is it fun having a brain
that works that fast?

91
00:06:07,894 --> 00:06:09,717
- Shut up.
- No, I mean it.

92
00:06:10,774 --> 00:06:12,683
Probably a brilliant finish too.

93
00:06:12,885 --> 00:06:14,861
I assure you it's not.

94
00:06:16,086 --> 00:06:19,021
- Hi, Simpkey.
- Hi.

95
00:06:21,525 --> 00:06:23,947
Your column today was fantastic.

96
00:06:24,149 --> 00:06:26,483
God, I loved that line:

97
00:06:26,933 --> 00:06:31,602
"The onrushing stripping of dignity
and thought from British lives."

98
00:06:32,278 --> 00:06:33,586
Great writing.

99
00:06:34,133 --> 00:06:36,237
Hey, I got you something
for Christmas.

100
00:06:36,437 --> 00:06:39,851
That's convenient
because I got you something too.

101
00:06:42,356 --> 00:06:45,258
Darling, I don't actually
have my gift with me.

102
00:06:45,652 --> 00:06:48,499
In fact, I probably mislaid it,
but I know I got you something.

103
00:06:48,692 --> 00:06:51,212
I suspect it's somewhere in my car,
want to know what it is?

104
00:06:52,595 --> 00:06:54,766
No. No, no, that's okay.

105
00:06:54,964 --> 00:06:56,938
I know you're gonna look hot in it.

106
00:06:57,651 --> 00:06:59,790
Well, let's hope you find it, then.

107
00:07:00,564 --> 00:07:02,767
Not exactly something hot...

108
00:07:02,962 --> 00:07:05,646
...but happy Christmas.

109
00:07:07,443 --> 00:07:08,784
Thank you.

110
00:07:10,898 --> 00:07:13,200
I didn't think we'd get a chance
to do this this year.

111
00:07:13,394 --> 00:07:15,631
Remember last Christmas,
we exchanged gifts in March.

112
00:07:15,826 --> 00:07:17,484
This is good.

113
00:07:17,682 --> 00:07:19,372
We're getting better.

114
00:07:22,417 --> 00:07:23,944
You stinker.

115
00:07:26,737 --> 00:07:28,559
It's a first edition.

116
00:07:28,753 --> 00:07:30,127
Where did you find it?

117
00:07:30,321 --> 00:07:34,347
Buried in that little place we found
in Covent Garden that time.

118
00:07:36,529 --> 00:07:38,764
Why are you so great?

119
00:07:40,689 --> 00:07:43,176
Everyone, can I have
your attention, please?

120
00:07:43,376 --> 00:07:45,710
Just a couple of minutes.
Thank you.

121
00:07:47,183 --> 00:07:49,485
I hate it that we can never talk.

122
00:07:51,151 --> 00:07:52,678
Hate it.

123
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:56,491
Well, first of all, a very
happy Christmas to every one of you.

124
00:07:56,687 --> 00:07:57,767
Happy Christmas.

125
00:07:57,967 --> 00:08:01,513
Now, we're not officially closed,
as you very well know.

126
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:03,652
But we are going to try
and get by this week...

127
00:08:03,854 --> 00:08:06,408
...with a smaller-than-normal staff.

128
00:08:08,334 --> 00:08:10,221
Now, before some of you
rush off on holiday...

129
00:08:10,413 --> 00:08:14,026
...I do have one
rather important announcement.

130
00:08:14,222 --> 00:08:15,847
Now, this affects Iris.

131
00:08:16,046 --> 00:08:19,144
- Iris Simpkins, where are you?
- Here, sir.

132
00:08:19,341 --> 00:08:21,991
- Iris, I have a tip for you.
- Excellent.

133
00:08:22,189 --> 00:08:25,222
A wedding was privately
announced earlier today...

134
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:28,649
...that I don't believe any other paper
in town knows about.

135
00:08:28,844 --> 00:08:33,187
And I want you to be the first to report
on this particular union...

136
00:08:33,388 --> 00:08:38,177
...as it is between two of our
most esteemed colleagues.

137
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:42,122
May I introduce the newly engaged
Sarah Smith-Alcott...

138
00:08:42,316 --> 00:08:45,764
...and Jasper Bloom!

139
00:08:46,444 --> 00:08:48,418
Come on.

140
00:08:58,602 --> 00:09:01,602
If I had known this was going
to happen, I'd have worn my good suit.

141
00:10:55,939 --> 00:10:57,281
Amanda!

142
00:11:03,171 --> 00:11:04,796
Amanda.

143
00:11:07,714 --> 00:11:10,299
Look, may I just say again...

144
00:11:10,497 --> 00:11:12,734
...that I did not sleep with her?

145
00:11:12,929 --> 00:11:16,344
Right, because your receptionist
needs to work till 3 in the morning.

146
00:11:16,545 --> 00:11:19,544
A bunch of us were working all night.
She wanted to hang out.

147
00:11:19,746 --> 00:11:23,006
Okay. Then swear on my life
that you didn't sleep with her.

148
00:11:23,201 --> 00:11:24,761
Come on.

149
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,007
Go ahead.

150
00:11:26,208 --> 00:11:28,314
Look, I don't wanna...
I'm not gonna...

151
00:11:28,512 --> 00:11:30,138
Your receptionist, Ethan?

152
00:11:30,367 --> 00:11:32,669
This is why I knew we were smart
never to get married.

153
00:11:32,864 --> 00:11:34,904
I told you never to get rid
of your house.

154
00:11:35,104 --> 00:11:37,438
Somewhere inside
I knew this about you.

155
00:11:37,632 --> 00:11:39,771
First of all, can you please
calm down?

156
00:11:39,967 --> 00:11:41,560
Because I did not
sleep with her.

157
00:11:41,759 --> 00:11:43,766
Secondly, we've had problems
for over a year.

158
00:11:43,967 --> 00:11:46,333
And I know you don't wanna deal
with that, but we have.

159
00:11:46,528 --> 00:11:49,374
Oh, I am well aware we've
had problems for the last year.

160
00:11:49,566 --> 00:11:52,284
If I work a little bit too much,
I never stop hearing about it.

161
00:11:52,479 --> 00:11:54,781
But if you work too much,
maestro...

162
00:11:54,974 --> 00:11:57,756
...it's for the sake of your music.
- "Lf" you work too much?

163
00:11:57,950 --> 00:11:59,674
Amanda, you cut
75 trailers this year.

164
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:02,685
You put a cutting room in the house
and sleep with your BlackBerry.

165
00:12:02,878 --> 00:12:04,983
And I'm not gonna have
a conversation about sex...

166
00:12:05,181 --> 00:12:07,068
...because I can't remember
the last time we did it.

167
00:12:07,262 --> 00:12:09,650
Come on, nobody has time for sex.

168
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:12,221
That's not entirely true.

169
00:12:12,637 --> 00:12:14,972
That's it!
You absolutely slept with her!

170
00:12:15,165 --> 00:12:16,823
Seriously, you have to get out.

171
00:12:17,021 --> 00:12:17,948
Oh, God.

172
00:12:18,141 --> 00:12:19,996
You know what I really think, Ethan?

173
00:12:20,188 --> 00:12:22,937
- I don't think you ever really loved me.
- Oh, please.

174
00:12:23,133 --> 00:12:27,442
You loved the idea of you and me, but
not so much me. Not me, not really.

175
00:12:27,644 --> 00:12:31,222
Look, I did the best I could.
Is anybody good enough for that job?

176
00:12:33,212 --> 00:12:35,994
I will send you your things.

177
00:12:37,627 --> 00:12:39,514
You know you do this, right?

178
00:12:39,707 --> 00:12:42,609
I mean, you screw up
every relationship you've ever been in.

179
00:12:42,811 --> 00:12:44,240
It's what you do.

180
00:12:46,362 --> 00:12:49,362
You didn't really wanna be a couple!
You resist it in your own way!

181
00:12:49,562 --> 00:12:50,741
Shut up!

182
00:12:50,939 --> 00:12:52,978
And it's hard to detect
how you even do it...

183
00:12:53,178 --> 00:12:55,699
...because nobody's quite
as smart as you!

184
00:12:56,122 --> 00:12:58,009
So you're hard to catch at it.

185
00:12:58,202 --> 00:13:00,885
But it always surfaces
and this is what happens.

186
00:13:01,082 --> 00:13:03,318
- What happens?
- Things end.

187
00:13:03,514 --> 00:13:05,139
Just like you knew they would.

188
00:13:05,338 --> 00:13:08,436
Amanda, you know how I feel
about you. There's nobody like you.

189
00:13:08,633 --> 00:13:10,455
You just don't wanna be
what I need.

190
00:13:10,650 --> 00:13:11,991
- Well, not what I "need."
- What?

191
00:13:12,184 --> 00:13:14,094
I mean...
You know what I mean.

192
00:13:14,297 --> 00:13:17,460
You know, I would never cheat on you,
not under any conditions.

193
00:13:17,657 --> 00:13:19,151
Neither would I, okay?

194
00:13:19,352 --> 00:13:22,069
Look at me. I'm down here
sweating like a pig. And look at you.

195
00:13:22,265 --> 00:13:24,850
The only woman on Earth
who breaks up with her boyfriend...

196
00:13:25,049 --> 00:13:27,219
...and doesn't even shed a tear?

197
00:13:27,417 --> 00:13:29,326
I mean,
that's gotta mean something, right?

198
00:13:29,528 --> 00:13:32,430
Why does it bug you so much
that I can't cry?

199
00:13:34,744 --> 00:13:36,402
Esophageal spasm.

200
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,606
Oh, God, it's a big one.

201
00:13:40,183 --> 00:13:44,972
- No, it's okay. I'll be all right.
- I know, I know. I'm thinking about me.

202
00:13:45,175 --> 00:13:47,509
Ethan. Look, it's over.

203
00:13:47,702 --> 00:13:50,320
You know, we might as well
be honest with each other.

204
00:13:50,518 --> 00:13:52,460
Just tell me.

205
00:13:53,175 --> 00:13:55,029
Did you sleep with her?

206
00:13:55,958 --> 00:13:57,268
Just say it.

207
00:13:57,462 --> 00:14:00,910
What's the difference at this point,
right? I mean, why torture me?

208
00:14:01,654 --> 00:14:04,207
Just put me out of my misery.

209
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:08,010
- What are we doing here...?
- Okay.

210
00:14:12,148 --> 00:14:16,621
Yes, okay? I slept with her.
Are you happy?

211
00:14:16,821 --> 00:14:20,715
I've been sleeping with her.
She's in love with me. She's young.

212
00:14:20,917 --> 00:14:23,600
Look, this is not a proud moment
for me.

213
00:14:23,796 --> 00:14:25,552
I mean, you should just know that.

214
00:14:27,859 --> 00:14:29,834
Amanda!

215
00:14:37,107 --> 00:14:38,416
Did you say, am I happy?

216
00:14:38,611 --> 00:14:41,840
I didn't mean that. You get me nuts
sometimes, I say things I don't mean.

217
00:14:42,035 --> 00:14:43,693
In the world of love, Ethan...

218
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:45,582
...not that I'm such a genius at it...

219
00:14:45,779 --> 00:14:48,626
...but in the world of love,
cheating is not acceptable.

220
00:14:48,818 --> 00:14:50,128
No matter what you think...

221
00:14:50,322 --> 00:14:54,000
I know you have a very high opinion
of yourself, but this isn't all me.

222
00:14:54,194 --> 00:14:56,649
- Okay.
- So when you're not in such a rage...

223
00:14:56,850 --> 00:14:59,119
...I think you'll see that too.
- Yeah, maybe.

224
00:14:59,314 --> 00:15:02,794
Maybe when I stop having visions
of you two together...

225
00:15:02,993 --> 00:15:04,619
...I will see your side.

226
00:15:08,945 --> 00:15:10,319
You gotta be...

227
00:15:18,831 --> 00:15:20,588
Punched him in the face.

228
00:15:24,081 --> 00:15:26,185
- Is this a bad time?
- No, no, I'm just...

229
00:15:26,383 --> 00:15:28,489
- I'm just flipping out a little bit.
- Oh, okay.

230
00:15:28,687 --> 00:15:31,687
God. Okay... No. I'm okay.
God, why would this happen?

231
00:15:31,887 --> 00:15:33,894
No. You know what? I'm all right.

232
00:15:34,863 --> 00:15:36,292
Hi.

233
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:38,445
What's up?

234
00:15:38,894 --> 00:15:39,942
Ben needs you.

235
00:15:40,271 --> 00:15:42,726
Rebecca Green was just your
average 20-year-old.

236
00:15:42,927 --> 00:15:46,888
Until the father she never knew left
her something she never expected.

237
00:15:47,086 --> 00:15:48,744
Don't scream.

238
00:15:48,942 --> 00:15:51,276
- Your father left you something.
- I never met my father.

239
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:53,990
- Now you know he was interesting.
- Lindsay Lohan.

240
00:15:54,190 --> 00:15:56,197
James Franco.

241
00:15:58,382 --> 00:16:00,138
- Deception.
- You happen to have two guns?

242
00:16:00,333 --> 00:16:02,122
I didn't think one would be enough.

243
00:16:02,318 --> 00:16:03,495
Christmas Day.

244
00:16:04,493 --> 00:16:06,534
Amazing! It finally looks like a hit.

245
00:16:06,733 --> 00:16:08,489
And that is why they pay you
the big bucks.

246
00:16:08,685 --> 00:16:11,205
I think we should go back
to the original cut on the end.

247
00:16:11,405 --> 00:16:12,899
- It's so much stronger.
- I agree.

248
00:16:13,101 --> 00:16:15,304
And make "Christmas Day"
twice as big...

249
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:18,849
...but try it in a red. Like a happy red,
not like a Scorsese red.

250
00:16:19,053 --> 00:16:20,426
Happy red.

251
00:16:22,859 --> 00:16:24,386
Okay, so we're done.

252
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:26,888
- Great.
- All right.

253
00:16:27,084 --> 00:16:30,499
Hey, you know, let's just take off
for a few weeks.

254
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:32,903
- Yeah.
- What do you mean? I'm not kidding.

255
00:16:33,099 --> 00:16:35,848
You always say that
this is our busiest time.

256
00:16:36,043 --> 00:16:37,952
I need to get out of town.

257
00:16:38,155 --> 00:16:40,423
You know? I think I need
some peace and quiet...

258
00:16:40,619 --> 00:16:43,205
...or whatever it is people
go away for.

259
00:16:43,403 --> 00:16:45,159
You know what I really wanna do?

260
00:16:45,354 --> 00:16:47,493
I wanna eat carbs without
wanting to kill myself.

261
00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:52,807
I wanna read a book.
Not just a magazine. An actual book.

262
00:16:53,002 --> 00:16:56,897
For years, I read these reviews,
I buy the books, but I never read them.

263
00:16:57,097 --> 00:16:59,814
Did you read that article in
The New York Times last Sunday?

264
00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:02,911
Severe stress makes women
age prematurely...

265
00:17:03,113 --> 00:17:05,414
...because stress causes DNA
in our cells to shrink...

266
00:17:05,609 --> 00:17:07,234
...until they can no longer replicate.

267
00:17:07,433 --> 00:17:09,255
So when we're stressed,
we look haggard.

268
00:17:09,448 --> 00:17:12,449
- This is just women, not men.
- I'm sorry.

269
00:17:12,649 --> 00:17:13,696
They used to say that...

270
00:17:13,896 --> 00:17:16,929
...single women over 35 were
more likely to be killed by a terrorist...

271
00:17:17,128 --> 00:17:18,884
...than to get married.
That was horrible.

272
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:21,862
But now our generation
is also not getting married.

273
00:17:22,055 --> 00:17:25,186
And bonus, real terrorists
actually became part of our lives.

274
00:17:25,384 --> 00:17:28,798
So the stress of it all shows up on our
faces, making us look haggard.

275
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,104
While Ethan goes on
looking cute forever...

276
00:17:31,302 --> 00:17:33,888
...shtupping his
24-year-old receptionist!

277
00:17:34,087 --> 00:17:36,061
Oh, my God!

278
00:17:36,647 --> 00:17:37,759
See what I mean?

279
00:17:37,959 --> 00:17:40,348
I need a vacation.

280
00:17:41,799 --> 00:17:43,206
Okay, where do I wanna go?

281
00:17:43,463 --> 00:17:46,942
By myself at Christmas.

282
00:17:47,622 --> 00:17:50,436
By myself depressed at Christmas.

283
00:17:51,622 --> 00:17:54,142
All alone on vacation.

284
00:17:55,718 --> 00:17:58,532
Alone, alone.

285
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:01,052
Totally alone.

286
00:18:15,589 --> 00:18:18,272
Please, just give me one.

287
00:18:18,468 --> 00:18:19,645
One tear.

288
00:18:27,843 --> 00:18:30,144
Okay. Moving on.

289
00:18:32,034 --> 00:18:33,823
"Worry-free Vacations."

290
00:18:34,019 --> 00:18:35,807
Good. Where's that?

291
00:18:36,515 --> 00:18:37,759
Bora Bora.

292
00:18:38,658 --> 00:18:41,243
"Kayak for one?" No, thank you.

293
00:18:42,178 --> 00:18:44,797
"Vacation Rentals." I could do that.

294
00:18:44,994 --> 00:18:47,896
Hole up in a house somewhere.
Disappear for a few weeks.

295
00:18:48,098 --> 00:18:49,471
I like that idea.

296
00:18:49,665 --> 00:18:51,967
"Where do you wanna go
on your next vacation?"

297
00:18:52,161 --> 00:18:53,655
"Click here and pick a country."

298
00:18:54,529 --> 00:18:55,991
Where do they speak English?

299
00:18:58,081 --> 00:18:59,455
"Click on a town or city."

300
00:18:59,649 --> 00:19:01,405
Let's see. Cotswolds.

301
00:19:02,433 --> 00:19:05,116
"Barn converted to modern house
in the beautiful Cotswolds."

302
00:19:06,017 --> 00:19:08,406
Which looks exactly like the Valley.

303
00:19:08,993 --> 00:19:11,196
Surrey. "Christmas in the country."

304
00:19:11,391 --> 00:19:15,254
"A fairy-tale English cottage
set in a tranquil country garden.

305
00:19:15,456 --> 00:19:19,896
Snuggle up by an old stone fireplace
and enjoy a cup of cocoa.

306
00:19:20,096 --> 00:19:23,958
An enchanting oasis of tranquility
in a quiet English hamlet...

307
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:27,192
...just 40 minutes
from exciting London."

308
00:19:28,670 --> 00:19:30,012
Yeah.

309
00:20:14,044 --> 00:20:16,116
What am I doing?

310
00:20:21,403 --> 00:20:23,226
Low point.

311
00:20:23,803 --> 00:20:25,428
Low point.

312
00:20:33,498 --> 00:20:36,630
"I'm interested... Renting your house.

313
00:20:38,041 --> 00:20:41,205
I'm wondering if your house
is available this Christmas.

314
00:20:41,402 --> 00:20:45,908
Because if it is,
you could be a real lifesaver."

315
00:20:50,202 --> 00:20:51,609
"I know it's late to be asking...

316
00:20:51,801 --> 00:20:54,835
...but if you're at all interested,
please contact me."

317
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:04,625
"I'm very interested, but the cottage
is only available for home exchange."

318
00:21:04,825 --> 00:21:06,068
"Home exchange"? What is that?

319
00:21:06,968 --> 00:21:09,205
"We switch houses, cars,
everything.

320
00:21:09,688 --> 00:21:11,576
I haven't done it before,
but friends have."

321
00:21:12,568 --> 00:21:14,477
Where are you?

322
00:21:16,247 --> 00:21:18,767
Please say somewhere far away.

323
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,480
"L.A."

324
00:21:24,951 --> 00:21:27,569
Never been there.
Always wanted to go.

325
00:21:28,054 --> 00:21:29,877
I'm Iris, by the way.

326
00:21:30,678 --> 00:21:32,588
I'm very normal.

327
00:21:33,399 --> 00:21:37,773
Neat freak. Healthy. Non-smoker.

328
00:21:38,678 --> 00:21:39,725
Single.

329
00:21:41,974 --> 00:21:44,079
Hate my horrible life.

330
00:21:44,277 --> 00:21:46,382
I'm Amanda.

331
00:21:46,582 --> 00:21:48,621
Loner, loser and complicated wreck.

332
00:21:48,821 --> 00:21:50,479
Hi.

333
00:21:50,965 --> 00:21:52,394
Hi.

334
00:21:55,893 --> 00:21:57,234
I must say...

335
00:21:57,972 --> 00:21:59,947
...your house looks idyllic.

336
00:22:00,148 --> 00:22:02,865
"Just what I need." Really?

337
00:22:03,476 --> 00:22:06,126
What does your place look like?

338
00:22:06,324 --> 00:22:09,805
My place is nice,
but it's a little bigger than yours.

339
00:22:25,875 --> 00:22:28,209
"Are there any men in your town?"

340
00:22:30,802 --> 00:22:32,329
Honestly?

341
00:22:57,361 --> 00:22:59,084
"Tomorrow's perfect."

342
00:23:04,688 --> 00:23:09,161
Okay. We are on for two weeks...

343
00:23:09,359 --> 00:23:10,701
...starting tomorrow.

344
00:23:23,054 --> 00:23:23,982
Hi.

345
00:23:25,486 --> 00:23:27,342
- Hi.
- How are you?

346
00:23:28,367 --> 00:23:31,563
- Fine.
- Honey, we're sitting there.

347
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:34,979
Sorry.

348
00:23:38,829 --> 00:23:41,218
Oh, yes. There it is.

349
00:23:41,421 --> 00:23:44,204
- Well, hello, dear.
- Hello.

350
00:23:44,397 --> 00:23:45,827
Excuse me.

351
00:23:46,734 --> 00:23:48,294
There we go.

352
00:23:49,197 --> 00:23:50,724
- I'm so sorry.
- No, no, it's okay.

353
00:23:50,925 --> 00:23:52,518
- Did you step on her foot?
- It's okay.

354
00:23:52,717 --> 00:23:54,211
Oh, dear. Clumsy me.

355
00:25:20,326 --> 00:25:24,189
Amanda Woods is proud to present
Her Life.

356
00:25:24,391 --> 00:25:26,300
- She had it all:
- Yes, that's it.

357
00:25:26,503 --> 00:25:28,444
The job. The house.

358
00:25:29,318 --> 00:25:30,365
The guy.

359
00:25:30,565 --> 00:25:31,875
This holiday season...

360
00:25:32,837 --> 00:25:36,252
...find out
what Amanda doesn't have.

361
00:26:12,292 --> 00:26:13,949
This is amazing, this is amazing!

362
00:26:15,459 --> 00:26:16,572
Oh, look at that.

363
00:26:45,153 --> 00:26:46,582
Madam?

364
00:26:48,736 --> 00:26:49,663
Madam?

365
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:53,407
- Madam?
- Yeah.

366
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:54,745
- We're here.
- Okay.

367
00:27:05,024 --> 00:27:06,103
This can't be it.

368
00:27:06,719 --> 00:27:08,442
No, it's just down that lane.

369
00:27:08,639 --> 00:27:12,086
But the thing is, I'll never be able
to turn this around at the other end.

370
00:27:12,286 --> 00:27:13,879
Think you can make it from here?

371
00:27:15,454 --> 00:27:16,916
No.

372
00:27:37,085 --> 00:27:40,597
Hey. You wouldn't happen to know
where Rosehill Cottage is?

373
00:27:40,797 --> 00:27:43,731
Go right at the bridge, and then
just keep going. Way down there.

374
00:28:04,251 --> 00:28:05,625
Okay.

375
00:28:09,435 --> 00:28:10,449
I'm here!

376
00:28:26,778 --> 00:28:28,916
Holy shit.

377
00:28:50,328 --> 00:28:53,328
Oh, my God!

378
00:29:34,484 --> 00:29:37,332
Okay, that'll be interesting.

379
00:29:43,732 --> 00:29:47,507
Get in the... Get in there. Okay.

380
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:49,195
Cute dress.

381
00:29:50,611 --> 00:29:52,554
Oh, suitcase.

382
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:00,746
Okay.

383
00:30:03,123 --> 00:30:04,716
Now what?

384
00:30:07,347 --> 00:30:08,394
I can do this.

385
00:30:08,883 --> 00:30:11,184
I can drive
on the wrong side of the road...

386
00:30:11,378 --> 00:30:12,807
...and the wrong side of the car.

387
00:30:13,010 --> 00:30:14,953
Just stay focused.

388
00:30:15,155 --> 00:30:18,121
Oh, please do not hit me!

389
00:30:21,266 --> 00:30:22,728
Okay, I hate this.

390
00:30:27,314 --> 00:30:28,241
Oh, God.

391
00:30:28,690 --> 00:30:30,926
Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no.

392
00:30:38,225 --> 00:30:39,501
- Move out of the way!
- Watch it!

393
00:30:39,696 --> 00:30:41,704
Sorry. Stop!

394
00:30:42,513 --> 00:30:43,919
Oh, God.

395
00:30:47,696 --> 00:30:49,451
I need a drink.

396
00:31:09,871 --> 00:31:11,300
Someone's having a party tonight.

397
00:31:13,358 --> 00:31:14,951
Oh, yeah.

398
00:31:15,150 --> 00:31:17,189
- They went to the shops.
- Didrt see anything.

399
00:31:18,990 --> 00:31:21,804
Came home,
and had a bit of a kiss and cuddle.

400
00:31:21,997 --> 00:31:22,924
The end.

401
00:31:23,117 --> 00:31:25,932
Rebecca Green
was just your average 20-year-old.

402
00:31:26,125 --> 00:31:27,751
Until the father she never knew...

403
00:31:27,949 --> 00:31:29,924
...left her something
she never expected.

404
00:31:30,126 --> 00:31:32,907
- You happen to have two guns?
- I didn't think one would be enough.

405
00:31:33,101 --> 00:31:35,141
Deception. Christmas Day.

406
00:31:35,629 --> 00:31:39,687
And that's why they pay me
the big bucks.

407
00:31:39,884 --> 00:31:42,567
And now the weather. First,
Northern England and North Wales...

408
00:31:42,764 --> 00:31:45,731
...will have sleet or snow in the
morning and again later in the day.

409
00:33:29,445 --> 00:33:30,393
Blinked.

410
00:34:10,626 --> 00:34:11,903
Oh, that's intense.

411
00:34:18,593 --> 00:34:20,186
Oh, no. "Gate"?

412
00:34:26,241 --> 00:34:28,216
- Who was he with?
- Maggie.

413
00:34:28,417 --> 00:34:30,653
- The flutes. This is the best part.
- One second.

414
00:34:31,072 --> 00:34:32,894
Hello... Hello?

415
00:34:34,848 --> 00:34:37,336
- Hello? Can you hear me?
- Yeah, it's Miles. Amanda?

416
00:34:37,536 --> 00:34:39,903
No, I'm sorry.
Amanda's not here, I'm afraid.

417
00:34:40,097 --> 00:34:43,708
I'm trying to figure out
how to open the gate. Oh, fu...

418
00:34:44,864 --> 00:34:45,791
Very nice.

419
00:34:46,463 --> 00:34:48,732
If you heard that, I'm sorry.

420
00:34:53,790 --> 00:34:54,968
- Hi.
- Hi.

421
00:34:55,167 --> 00:34:57,271
I'm so sorry.
I'm new at the gate thing.

422
00:34:57,471 --> 00:34:58,900
It's okay. It was pretty funny.

423
00:35:00,735 --> 00:35:02,261
I'm Miles. I work with Ethan.

424
00:35:03,134 --> 00:35:04,062
Ethan?

425
00:35:04,638 --> 00:35:06,581
- Amanda's ex.
- Oh, right.

426
00:35:07,133 --> 00:35:08,214
Right.

427
00:35:08,414 --> 00:35:10,617
Know when she'll be back?
Supposed to pick up things.

428
00:35:10,815 --> 00:35:12,702
Amanda's in England,
actually, on holiday.

429
00:35:12,893 --> 00:35:14,387
I'm staying here while she's away.

430
00:35:16,445 --> 00:35:18,779
- You okay?
- Yes.

431
00:35:18,973 --> 00:35:20,828
Yeah, something just
blew into my eye.

432
00:35:21,021 --> 00:35:23,125
Oh, I hate that. Let me see.

433
00:35:23,325 --> 00:35:26,488
Yep, you got something in
your eyelash. You want me to get it?

434
00:35:27,933 --> 00:35:29,787
- Okay.
- Okay.

435
00:35:29,981 --> 00:35:32,249
- Yeah, Santa Anas.
- Pardon?

436
00:35:32,444 --> 00:35:34,745
The wind. It's what makes
it so warm this time of year.

437
00:35:35,452 --> 00:35:37,689
Legend has it,
when the Santa Anas blow...

438
00:35:37,884 --> 00:35:39,771
...all bets are off.
Anything can happen.

439
00:35:40,443 --> 00:35:43,346
That's it. You okay?

440
00:35:44,603 --> 00:35:46,938
Better. Thank you.

441
00:35:51,035 --> 00:35:53,206
So you needed to...

442
00:35:53,403 --> 00:35:54,898
Pick up Ethars laptop.

443
00:35:55,867 --> 00:35:57,295
And you're his...

444
00:35:57,498 --> 00:35:59,833
Oh, well, I'm a film composer, too,
like Ethan, but...

445
00:36:00,026 --> 00:36:02,579
- Did you compose this? It's beautiful.
- This?

446
00:36:02,778 --> 00:36:04,305
Yes, I did. I wrote this.

447
00:36:04,506 --> 00:36:06,710
No, I didn't. I wish I did.

448
00:36:06,906 --> 00:36:09,906
This is the great Ennio Morricone.

449
00:36:10,330 --> 00:36:11,824
Would you mind
coming back tomorrow?

450
00:36:12,025 --> 00:36:14,131
I just want to check this
with Amanda's assistant.

451
00:36:14,329 --> 00:36:15,256
Sure.

452
00:36:15,449 --> 00:36:17,303
- I'm Iris, by the way.
- Miles.

453
00:36:17,754 --> 00:36:19,825
- Right.
- And this is my Maggie.

454
00:36:20,026 --> 00:36:23,854
I mean, just Maggie.
Not "my" Maggie.

455
00:36:24,057 --> 00:36:25,846
- Hello.
- Hey.

456
00:36:26,041 --> 00:36:27,416
- Are you ready?
- Yeah.

457
00:36:27,609 --> 00:36:29,202
Okay.

458
00:36:30,968 --> 00:36:32,397
Don't blow away.

459
00:36:33,079 --> 00:36:34,487
I won't.

460
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:09,292
Anything can happen.

461
00:37:15,189 --> 00:37:20,754
Five, six, seven, eight, nine,
10, 11, 12. One a.m. In London.

462
00:38:03,153 --> 00:38:04,081
Who is it?

463
00:38:04,274 --> 00:38:06,378
It's me. Hurry up. It's freezing.

464
00:38:07,313 --> 00:38:09,256
- Who are you?
- Iris, open the door...

465
00:38:09,458 --> 00:38:11,913
...or I swear I'm gonna take a leak
all over your...

466
00:38:15,889 --> 00:38:17,580
You're not Iris.

467
00:38:18,194 --> 00:38:20,779
Or if you are,
I'm much drunker than I realized.

468
00:38:20,977 --> 00:38:22,700
I'm sorry for my profanity.

469
00:38:22,897 --> 00:38:25,449
I wasrt expecting you.

470
00:38:26,064 --> 00:38:29,098
Well, I wasrt expecting you either.

471
00:38:30,416 --> 00:38:31,529
Nevertheless, may I just...?

472
00:38:33,167 --> 00:38:36,102
Yeah. Of course. Sure.
You had to... Yeah.

473
00:38:37,007 --> 00:38:39,244
I'm Graham. Iris' brother.

474
00:38:39,726 --> 00:38:41,385
Brother.

475
00:38:41,584 --> 00:38:43,438
I'm Amanda Woods.
I'm staying here.

476
00:38:43,855 --> 00:38:45,480
Amandawoods?
Is that all one word?

477
00:38:46,479 --> 00:38:48,389
No. No, it's not.

478
00:38:48,878 --> 00:38:51,049
Brother? Oh, my God.

479
00:38:54,733 --> 00:38:57,319
So Iris is... Where is...?
Where is she?

480
00:38:57,518 --> 00:38:58,761
She didn't tell you?

481
00:38:58,958 --> 00:39:01,991
She could have done...

482
00:39:03,470 --> 00:39:05,772
...but as previously stated...

483
00:39:05,965 --> 00:39:09,314
...I 'm... I've just... I've been...

484
00:39:09,517 --> 00:39:11,721
She's in Los Angeles.

485
00:39:11,917 --> 00:39:15,113
That's not possible.
Iris never goes anywhere.

486
00:39:15,309 --> 00:39:17,283
Well, we have that in common.

487
00:39:17,485 --> 00:39:21,129
No, she listed this cottage on a
home-exchange website and I found it.

488
00:39:21,324 --> 00:39:24,226
We switched houses for two weeks.
For the holiday.

489
00:39:24,428 --> 00:39:28,006
She's in L.A. At my house
and I'm here.

490
00:39:28,524 --> 00:39:30,629
- People actually do that?
- Apparently.

491
00:39:30,828 --> 00:39:34,144
Yeah. I mean, it seems.
Here I am in my pajamas.

492
00:39:34,667 --> 00:39:37,701
She did ring me last night. I didn't
get a chance to get back to her.

493
00:39:37,899 --> 00:39:39,687
I feel awful now.

494
00:39:42,059 --> 00:39:44,514
Would you mind if I sat?
I feel like I might bump into you.

495
00:39:44,714 --> 00:39:46,886
Sure. Yeah. Sit.

496
00:39:52,363 --> 00:39:53,508
You okay?

497
00:39:53,706 --> 00:39:55,845
Yeah, I'm good.

498
00:39:56,938 --> 00:39:58,693
Look, I'm sorry about the intrusion.

499
00:39:59,338 --> 00:40:02,337
Although I may not appear it,
I am in fact Iris'...

500
00:40:02,537 --> 00:40:04,773
...semi-respectable big brother.

501
00:40:05,577 --> 00:40:08,425
But on the rare...
Or lately not-so-rare occasion...

502
00:40:08,617 --> 00:40:10,886
...that I frequent the local pub...

503
00:40:11,081 --> 00:40:14,310
...and get inordinately pissed,
my little sister puts me up...

504
00:40:14,697 --> 00:40:16,224
...so I don't get behind the wheel.

505
00:40:16,425 --> 00:40:21,280
Pathetic explanation, but unfortunately
it's become a bit of a routine.

506
00:40:22,856 --> 00:40:24,743
So how's it going so far?

507
00:40:24,936 --> 00:40:27,358
I mean, up until I showed up
and ruined your night.

508
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:30,855
Well, it's not going so great.

509
00:40:31,048 --> 00:40:32,935
Yeah, I'm leaving tomorrow
on a noon plane.

510
00:40:34,504 --> 00:40:35,518
When did you get here?

511
00:40:37,544 --> 00:40:39,005
About six hours ago.

512
00:40:39,208 --> 00:40:41,663
We've made a great impression
on you, haven't we?

513
00:40:41,863 --> 00:40:43,521
No, it's not that. It's just that...

514
00:40:43,718 --> 00:40:45,824
You know,
I'm not quite myself right now.

515
00:40:46,023 --> 00:40:47,616
I came here on a stupid whim.

516
00:40:47,814 --> 00:40:51,011
Honestly, I've never thought about
anything less. It's very unlike me.

517
00:40:51,718 --> 00:40:53,823
Would you like something to drink?

518
00:40:54,022 --> 00:40:56,771
Glass of water? Tea?

519
00:40:56,966 --> 00:40:57,893
Wine, maybe?

520
00:40:58,758 --> 00:41:02,620
I think there's a bottle of brandy.
Fancy a glass?

521
00:41:04,133 --> 00:41:05,726
- Sure.
- Good.

522
00:41:07,237 --> 00:41:11,230
So... I'm sorry, I've totally blanked
and forgotten your name.

523
00:41:11,429 --> 00:41:12,705
Amanda.

524
00:41:12,901 --> 00:41:14,308
So, Amanda...

525
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:15,777
...you're not married, are you?

526
00:41:16,677 --> 00:41:18,433
Why? Do I look not married?

527
00:41:18,628 --> 00:41:22,719
No. It was just a backwards way
of asking if you were married.

528
00:41:22,915 --> 00:41:24,704
No, not at all.

529
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:28,380
I don't know what that means.

530
00:41:28,931 --> 00:41:31,070
I mean, no, I'm not married.

531
00:41:33,603 --> 00:41:34,531
Me neither.

532
00:41:37,475 --> 00:41:39,897
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

533
00:41:48,129 --> 00:41:49,559
So is it horrible if I stay?

534
00:41:49,762 --> 00:41:51,584
I'll be gone
before you even wake up.

535
00:41:51,778 --> 00:41:53,949
I promise you will never
lay eyes on me again.

536
00:41:56,481 --> 00:41:58,903
Of... No, that's fine. Sure.

537
00:41:59,106 --> 00:42:01,309
- Thank you.
- Let me just get you a blanket.

538
00:42:01,505 --> 00:42:03,709
In the cupboard,
on top of the Scrabble.

539
00:42:05,761 --> 00:42:10,998
So why is it you aren't
quite yourself at the moment?

540
00:42:11,201 --> 00:42:15,478
Well, I just broke up with someone.

541
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:16,957
Yesterday.

542
00:42:17,152 --> 00:42:18,712
And I guess
what I was feeling...

543
00:42:18,912 --> 00:42:21,181
...was that I didn't wanna be alone
over the holidays.

544
00:42:21,375 --> 00:42:23,066
I thought that
if I was somewhere else...

545
00:42:23,264 --> 00:42:24,692
...I wouldn't realize I was alone.

546
00:42:24,896 --> 00:42:27,100
Then I got here
and never felt more alone in my life.

547
00:42:27,295 --> 00:42:28,986
Big surprise.

548
00:42:29,184 --> 00:42:30,907
Bet you're glad you knocked
on this door.

549
00:42:31,103 --> 00:42:33,110
I am, actually.

550
00:42:35,808 --> 00:42:37,629
Yeah, well...

551
00:42:38,559 --> 00:42:42,038
Sorry and good night.

552
00:42:42,238 --> 00:42:43,798
Sweet dreams.

553
00:42:49,470 --> 00:42:51,990
Do you think you could...

554
00:42:52,830 --> 00:42:54,488
Would you mind...

555
00:42:55,325 --> 00:42:56,470
...trying that again?

556
00:43:08,988 --> 00:43:10,450
Bad?

557
00:43:12,701 --> 00:43:13,748
Weird.

558
00:43:16,668 --> 00:43:18,294
Kissing a total stranger.

559
00:43:18,492 --> 00:43:21,143
Really? I do it all the time.

560
00:43:23,580 --> 00:43:25,270
Let me try this.

561
00:43:35,610 --> 00:43:37,651
Maybe if I closed my eyes.

562
00:43:54,906 --> 00:43:58,353
You know, given that
I'm in a bit of a personal crisis...

563
00:43:58,553 --> 00:44:02,066
...and I find myself
in a total stranger's home...

564
00:44:02,264 --> 00:44:04,817
...in a town that I can't
actually remember the name of...

565
00:44:05,017 --> 00:44:07,253
...and considering
that you showed up...

566
00:44:07,449 --> 00:44:10,383
...and you're, like,
insanely good-looking...

567
00:44:10,584 --> 00:44:13,748
...and really drunk and probably
won't remember me anyway...

568
00:44:13,943 --> 00:44:17,260
...I 'm thinking...

569
00:44:17,465 --> 00:44:19,319
...we should have sex.

570
00:44:20,151 --> 00:44:21,492
If you want.

571
00:44:23,031 --> 00:44:24,525
Is that a trick question?

572
00:44:25,495 --> 00:44:27,884
I'm actually serious.

573
00:44:28,376 --> 00:44:31,987
And not that it matters, but I've never
said anything like that in my entire life.

574
00:44:32,567 --> 00:44:33,712
It's just that this whole...

575
00:44:33,910 --> 00:44:37,620
...knowing-I'll-never-see-you-again
thing is kind of exciting.

576
00:44:37,815 --> 00:44:39,821
I mean, this is what a vacatiors
supposed to be.

577
00:44:40,023 --> 00:44:42,869
You're supposed to vacate life,
do the unexpected. And you are...

578
00:44:43,574 --> 00:44:45,963
...definitely unexpected.

579
00:44:46,166 --> 00:44:48,621
This all sounded wonderful
till I became the cabana boy.

580
00:44:49,430 --> 00:44:51,469
And you're funny,
which is, like, a bonus.

581
00:44:51,670 --> 00:44:53,296
Yeah? Never meet me
when I'm sober.

582
00:44:53,749 --> 00:44:55,243
Deal.

583
00:45:00,405 --> 00:45:02,260
Oh, also, I should warn you.

584
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:05,322
I'm not very good at this.

585
00:45:05,524 --> 00:45:06,986
"This" being...

586
00:45:07,573 --> 00:45:10,703
- Sex.
- Okay. Now, that cannot be true.

587
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:14,064
Nevertheless, the guy that I lived with
mentioned it once or twice...

588
00:45:14,260 --> 00:45:17,740
...and a girl does not forget
a comment like that. Not even me.

589
00:45:27,859 --> 00:45:29,582
I mean, how bad could I be?

590
00:45:29,778 --> 00:45:33,902
Sex is pretty basic, right? Am I
pretty much talking you out of this?

591
00:45:34,099 --> 00:45:35,757
Strangely, not at all.

592
00:45:35,955 --> 00:45:37,961
How do you feel about foreplay?

593
00:45:38,674 --> 00:45:40,496
I think it's overrated.

594
00:45:40,689 --> 00:45:43,788
Significantly overrated.

595
00:45:44,178 --> 00:45:48,814
You are quickly becoming one of
the most interesting girls I've ever met.

596
00:45:58,801 --> 00:46:00,263
Look at you.

597
00:46:00,465 --> 00:46:03,334
You're already better than you think.

598
00:46:17,808 --> 00:46:19,847
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

599
00:46:20,047 --> 00:46:23,821
I lost my contacts
last night somehow.

600
00:46:27,374 --> 00:46:29,262
- Much better.
- Yeah.

601
00:46:30,159 --> 00:46:31,173
Can I help you with that?

602
00:46:31,631 --> 00:46:33,899
I should know how to do this.

603
00:46:37,838 --> 00:46:41,482
You're supposed to
plug them in over here. Right.

604
00:46:49,262 --> 00:46:52,130
- So, Amanda, I just really...
- Yeah. You know...

605
00:46:52,332 --> 00:46:55,529
...listen, you don't have to worry
about a thing here. Okay?

606
00:46:57,453 --> 00:46:58,402
Okay.

607
00:46:58,605 --> 00:47:02,379
I mean, it was great
meeting you and everything.

608
00:47:03,405 --> 00:47:08,325
Definitely. Also, for the record,
your ex-boyfriend is, in my opinion...

609
00:47:08,524 --> 00:47:10,913
...extremely mistaken about you.

610
00:47:11,308 --> 00:47:12,617
Well, yeah, you were drunk.

611
00:47:13,260 --> 00:47:15,561
- Not that drunk.
- Yeah.

612
00:47:16,299 --> 00:47:17,892
Oh, that's mine.

613
00:47:18,380 --> 00:47:21,096
Sophie. I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to look.

614
00:47:21,995 --> 00:47:23,369
I'll call her back.

615
00:47:28,395 --> 00:47:30,304
Coffee cups.

616
00:47:32,298 --> 00:47:35,168
- Here.
- Thank you.

617
00:47:36,362 --> 00:47:37,289
You don't want one?

618
00:47:37,866 --> 00:47:40,103
I should probably be going.

619
00:47:42,506 --> 00:47:46,247
Oh, yeah. You know, I gotta get going
in a few minutes myself.

620
00:47:46,441 --> 00:47:48,928
So listen.

621
00:47:49,129 --> 00:47:51,617
I know you're leaving
and absolutely not interested...

622
00:47:51,817 --> 00:47:54,566
...in getting involved,
but just so you know...

623
00:47:54,761 --> 00:47:57,696
...things in my life
are a little bit complicated...

624
00:47:57,897 --> 00:48:00,101
...and even if you were staying,
I can promise you...

625
00:48:00,296 --> 00:48:02,817
...you wouldn't...
- You really don't have to do this.

626
00:48:03,016 --> 00:48:06,311
Look, I'm sort of a mess
in this area myself.

627
00:48:06,503 --> 00:48:10,246
And anyway, I mean,
honestly, we hardly know each other.

628
00:48:11,143 --> 00:48:12,670
Well, I wouldn't exactly say that...

629
00:48:12,871 --> 00:48:16,930
...but I just want to assure you,
you're better off. I'm...

630
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:18,567
- I'm...
- Okay.

631
00:48:21,287 --> 00:48:22,716
No need to go on. Right.

632
00:48:22,918 --> 00:48:26,748
Well, I just want to be sure
you are okay because somehow...

633
00:48:26,951 --> 00:48:31,773
...I find I tend to hurt women
simply by being myself, so...

634
00:48:31,974 --> 00:48:34,843
I'm not going
to fall in love with you, I promise.

635
00:48:35,558 --> 00:48:37,859
Okay. Nicely put. Thank you.

636
00:48:38,054 --> 00:48:42,276
No, it's just that I know myself.
I'm not sure I even fall in love.

637
00:48:42,470 --> 00:48:44,509
Not like the way other people do.

638
00:48:45,382 --> 00:48:46,908
How's that for something to admit?

639
00:48:48,422 --> 00:48:51,072
Well, like I said,
Most Interesting Girl Award.

640
00:48:52,421 --> 00:48:55,071
I'm gonna try to see that
as a compliment.

641
00:48:55,269 --> 00:48:58,236
You should. Absolutely.

642
00:49:01,797 --> 00:49:03,105
Right.

643
00:49:04,420 --> 00:49:07,169
Okay, then. Well...

644
00:49:07,364 --> 00:49:10,266
Utter honesty. Very refreshing.

645
00:49:10,916 --> 00:49:13,882
Well, you probably
won't be hearing from me...

646
00:49:14,084 --> 00:49:16,538
...because even if you wanted to,
and you clearly don't...

647
00:49:16,739 --> 00:49:19,641
...I have the classic
male problem of no follow-through.

648
00:49:19,843 --> 00:49:22,713
Absolutely never remember
to call after a date.

649
00:49:25,859 --> 00:49:29,121
But since this wasrt a date
I guess I'm off the hook.

650
00:49:30,307 --> 00:49:31,289
Exactly.

651
00:49:34,817 --> 00:49:36,607
But what if I wanted to call you?

652
00:49:39,681 --> 00:49:42,715
Right. Sorry. Apparently not
the right thing to say at all.

653
00:49:43,586 --> 00:49:46,400
Well, if your flight's canceled
or for some reason...

654
00:49:46,593 --> 00:49:49,440
...you change your mind, I'm having
dinner with some friends...

655
00:49:49,633 --> 00:49:50,712
...at the pub tonight.

656
00:49:53,185 --> 00:49:54,526
And...

657
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:59,958
...if not, then, well...

658
00:50:01,792 --> 00:50:03,220
...you're lovely.

659
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:09,628
So are you.

660
00:50:19,007 --> 00:50:23,098
Attention passengers,
this is the final boarding call...

661
00:50:23,295 --> 00:50:26,229
...for British Airways flight 42.

662
00:50:32,990 --> 00:50:34,713
Amanda wasrt looking for love...

663
00:50:36,062 --> 00:50:39,509
...but that doesn't mean
it didn't find her.

664
00:50:39,709 --> 00:50:41,084
Well, ma'am, you're good to go.

665
00:50:42,717 --> 00:50:43,894
Thank you.

666
00:51:09,212 --> 00:51:12,342
Thank you, Amanda.

667
00:51:33,049 --> 00:51:34,228
Hello?

668
00:51:34,426 --> 00:51:35,538
Where am I finding you?

669
00:51:38,266 --> 00:51:39,345
Jasper.

670
00:51:39,546 --> 00:51:41,782
Is it okay that I'm calling you?

671
00:51:44,153 --> 00:51:45,975
I suppose so.

672
00:51:46,457 --> 00:51:47,384
How are you?

673
00:51:47,577 --> 00:51:49,999
Could we start
with a less complicated question?

674
00:51:51,672 --> 00:51:52,817
What's wrong?

675
00:51:53,016 --> 00:51:57,140
I'm having some real problems
with a section of my book.

676
00:51:57,335 --> 00:51:59,507
I can use some Iris.

677
00:52:00,824 --> 00:52:02,580
Would it be awful
if I sent you some pages?

678
00:52:02,776 --> 00:52:05,296
Just tell me if it is.
I don't wanna mess you up. I'll...

679
00:52:05,495 --> 00:52:08,365
I know that you're the only one
who can really help me.

680
00:52:09,463 --> 00:52:11,602
No. Well... I mean...

681
00:52:13,431 --> 00:52:14,838
...if you need me.

682
00:52:15,031 --> 00:52:17,519
Well, you know
you are my little survival kit.

683
00:52:18,903 --> 00:52:23,311
So, Simpkey, have you put on
that little red bikini yet?

684
00:52:23,510 --> 00:52:26,227
You know,
the one that unties at the back?

685
00:52:26,422 --> 00:52:28,844
How do you remember
my little red bikini?

686
00:52:29,046 --> 00:52:31,915
I remember everything.

687
00:52:32,118 --> 00:52:33,711
Do you?

688
00:52:35,094 --> 00:52:37,962
You know, just the other day,
I was just thinking about that time...

689
00:52:38,165 --> 00:52:40,140
Darling, I've just arrived
at Soho House.

690
00:52:40,341 --> 00:52:42,228
I'm meeting some friends for drinks.

691
00:52:42,421 --> 00:52:44,875
- Okay.
- You keep the change.

692
00:52:45,397 --> 00:52:46,607
Bloody cold in here.

693
00:52:46,805 --> 00:52:48,495
Okay, I'm sending you
the pages tomorrow.

694
00:52:48,693 --> 00:52:52,522
Look for them, will you?
And have some fun today, okay?

695
00:52:53,620 --> 00:52:55,180
Okay.

696
00:53:12,978 --> 00:53:14,320
Graham?

697
00:53:44,369 --> 00:53:46,256
Oh, no, is he lost?

698
00:53:59,503 --> 00:54:00,813
Excuse me.

699
00:54:01,968 --> 00:54:05,317
Hello. Can I offer you a lift home?

700
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:08,075
Why? You know where I live?

701
00:54:09,006 --> 00:54:10,217
I believe I do, yes.

702
00:54:10,414 --> 00:54:12,935
Good. Then that makes one of us.

703
00:54:16,270 --> 00:54:17,830
Your house is lovely.

704
00:54:18,030 --> 00:54:20,202
I've lived here 47 years.

705
00:54:20,398 --> 00:54:23,366
Back then, there were only
six houses on this block.

706
00:54:23,566 --> 00:54:25,704
Every year,
they tear another one down...

707
00:54:25,902 --> 00:54:27,330
...not that I blame them.

708
00:54:27,534 --> 00:54:29,803
They werert that great
to begin with.

709
00:54:31,918 --> 00:54:36,107
But that's how I got confused.
I didn't recognize one house.

710
00:54:37,325 --> 00:54:39,048
That would be confusing.

711
00:54:40,620 --> 00:54:42,508
What part of England are you from?

712
00:54:44,557 --> 00:54:48,102
- Surrey.
- Cary Grant was from Surrey.

713
00:54:48,300 --> 00:54:50,339
That's right, he was.

714
00:54:50,828 --> 00:54:53,795
- How did you know that?
- Oh, he told me once.

715
00:54:53,996 --> 00:54:56,898
Well, I thank you very much,
young lady.

716
00:55:00,619 --> 00:55:02,310
Let me help you with that.

717
00:55:03,243 --> 00:55:04,585
Okay.

718
00:55:04,778 --> 00:55:06,153
L... Thank you.

719
00:55:07,627 --> 00:55:08,772
There you go.

720
00:55:08,970 --> 00:55:11,304
Well, this was some meet-cute.

721
00:55:11,787 --> 00:55:14,242
- Sorry?
- It's how two characters meet...

722
00:55:14,442 --> 00:55:15,718
...in a movie.

723
00:55:16,490 --> 00:55:19,011
Say a man and a woman...

724
00:55:19,211 --> 00:55:21,577
...both need something to sleep in.

725
00:55:22,313 --> 00:55:25,608
And they both go
to the same mers pajama department.

726
00:55:25,802 --> 00:55:28,736
- Right.
- And the man says to the salesman:

727
00:55:28,937 --> 00:55:32,286
"I just need bottoms."
The woman says, "I just need a top."

728
00:55:32,937 --> 00:55:36,548
They look at each other,
and that's the "meet-cute."

729
00:55:37,129 --> 00:55:38,558
Oh, I see.

730
00:55:38,761 --> 00:55:41,444
Of course, this isn't
quite that cute, but...

731
00:55:43,113 --> 00:55:45,796
So you're in the film business?

732
00:55:45,993 --> 00:55:49,473
Was. Yes, yes, I was.

733
00:55:50,152 --> 00:55:52,039
I was a writer.

734
00:55:59,079 --> 00:56:00,705
I could be here till tomorrow.

735
00:56:00,903 --> 00:56:02,561
Oh, here.

736
00:56:03,047 --> 00:56:04,574
Let me.

737
00:56:10,630 --> 00:56:12,223
Thank you.

738
00:56:42,148 --> 00:56:44,090
Oh, my God.

739
00:57:00,004 --> 00:57:01,913
Well, goodbye, then.

740
00:57:03,106 --> 00:57:05,528
I enjoyed our meet-cute.

741
00:57:05,730 --> 00:57:07,673
Well, thank you.
Thank you for rescuing me.

742
00:57:08,195 --> 00:57:11,456
It's a pleasure. Absolutely.

743
00:57:17,858 --> 00:57:20,956
You know, I hope you
don't find this strange...

744
00:57:21,154 --> 00:57:24,350
...but I've just arrived here,
and, well, I don't really know anyone.

745
00:57:24,545 --> 00:57:27,327
And I was thinking of going out
for dinner tonight.

746
00:57:27,522 --> 00:57:30,172
Well, if you're not busy,
would you like to join me?

747
00:57:30,913 --> 00:57:35,769
Busy? Honey,
I haven't been busy since 1978.

748
00:57:38,913 --> 00:57:41,630
I learned everything
working in this place.

749
00:57:41,825 --> 00:57:43,962
- Best job I ever had.
- Wait, wait, wait.

750
00:57:44,161 --> 00:57:46,265
That was your first job
in Hollywood?

751
00:57:46,463 --> 00:57:48,373
Louis B. Mayer's office boy?

752
00:57:48,831 --> 00:57:52,955
Actually, my first job
was as a Western Union messenger.

753
00:57:53,151 --> 00:57:58,268
That's how I met Mayer. I delivered
a telegram to his office at MGM.

754
00:57:58,464 --> 00:58:01,879
When I walked in, all the girls
in the office were in a tizzy.

755
00:58:02,079 --> 00:58:03,966
Their office boy didn't show up.

756
00:58:04,767 --> 00:58:09,110
I volunteered for the job.
The next day, I was on the payroll.

757
00:58:09,311 --> 00:58:11,732
I was 17 years old.

758
00:58:12,926 --> 00:58:16,636
So was Hollywood really as great
back then as I imagine?

759
00:58:16,830 --> 00:58:17,975
It was better.

760
00:58:21,437 --> 00:58:23,739
You know what I've been
asking myself all night?

761
00:58:24,155 --> 00:58:28,377
What? Why I'm bothering you
with all these questions?

762
00:58:28,571 --> 00:58:31,254
I'm wondering
why a beautiful girl like you...

763
00:58:31,931 --> 00:58:35,192
...would go to a stranger's house
for her Christmas vacation...

764
00:58:35,386 --> 00:58:38,867
...and on top of that, spend Saturday
night with an old cocker like me.

765
00:58:39,578 --> 00:58:40,723
Well, l...

766
00:58:40,923 --> 00:58:44,501
I just wanted to get away
from the people I see all the time.

767
00:58:48,474 --> 00:58:51,192
Well, not all the people.

768
00:58:52,571 --> 00:58:53,748
One person.

769
00:58:54,266 --> 00:58:58,837
I wanted to get away from one guy.

770
00:58:59,674 --> 00:59:05,009
An ex-boyfriend who just got engaged
and forgot to tell me.

771
00:59:05,210 --> 00:59:07,382
- Sorry.
- So he's a schmuck.

772
00:59:07,579 --> 00:59:11,986
As a matter of fact, he is.
A huge schmuck.

773
00:59:12,475 --> 00:59:14,841
- How did you know?
- He let you go.

774
00:59:15,034 --> 00:59:16,790
This is not a hard one to figure out.

775
00:59:16,981 --> 00:59:21,041
Iris, in the movies
we have leading ladies...

776
00:59:21,238 --> 00:59:22,765
...and we have the best friend.

777
00:59:23,221 --> 00:59:25,676
You, I can tell, are a leading lady.

778
00:59:25,878 --> 00:59:28,747
But for some reason,
you're behaving like the best friend.

779
00:59:30,134 --> 00:59:31,475
You're so right.

780
00:59:31,669 --> 00:59:35,663
You're supposed to be the leading
lady of your own life, for God's sake.

781
00:59:37,206 --> 00:59:41,396
Arthur, I've been going
to a therapist for three years.

782
00:59:41,589 --> 00:59:45,103
And she's never explained
anything to me that well.

783
00:59:46,549 --> 00:59:48,306
That was brilliant.

784
00:59:48,821 --> 00:59:51,244
Brutal, but brilliant.

785
00:59:51,990 --> 00:59:53,266
Thank you.

786
01:00:02,805 --> 01:00:06,221
I haven't had that much to drink in...

787
01:00:06,421 --> 01:00:08,331
What am I saying?

788
01:00:08,534 --> 01:00:12,690
- I've never had that much to drink.
- Yes, I believe no one ever has.

789
01:00:12,885 --> 01:00:16,943
Okay, the last thing I remember
was coming in here last night and...

790
01:00:21,462 --> 01:00:24,658
- I had nothing to do with that.
- Oh, I know, but you were here.

791
01:00:25,744 --> 01:00:29,008
- I was.
- Oh, God. So I guess we...

792
01:00:29,201 --> 01:00:31,983
Did we... I mean, did we...

793
01:00:33,265 --> 01:00:35,567
- We didn't?
- We did not.

794
01:00:35,761 --> 01:00:37,485
Oh, thank God.

795
01:00:37,681 --> 01:00:41,991
I mean, not "thank God,"
but just thank God.

796
01:00:42,193 --> 01:00:44,876
Because I didn't remember...

797
01:00:45,073 --> 01:00:47,975
So why didn't we...
Just remind me a little.

798
01:00:49,072 --> 01:00:50,317
Call me old-fashioned...

799
01:00:50,513 --> 01:00:53,579
...but one doesn't have sex
with women who are unconscious.

800
01:00:53,777 --> 01:00:56,079
Unconscious? Oh, God.

801
01:00:56,273 --> 01:00:59,306
That must have been
really attractive.

802
01:00:59,504 --> 01:01:01,260
Why did you stay?

803
01:01:01,936 --> 01:01:03,146
Because you asked me to.

804
01:01:04,497 --> 01:01:05,872
I did, didn't I?

805
01:01:08,657 --> 01:01:11,558
Did I beg at one point?

806
01:01:14,545 --> 01:01:18,156
From the moment I met you,
it's been an adventure.

807
01:01:18,353 --> 01:01:20,491
Oh, yes.

808
01:01:20,689 --> 01:01:24,845
And I am deeply sorry about that.
I have nothing to say for myself...

809
01:01:25,041 --> 01:01:29,264
...other than I must be
temporarily nuts right now.

810
01:01:30,417 --> 01:01:33,733
Olivia. Sorry, I didn't mean to look.

811
01:01:33,936 --> 01:01:36,905
- Again.
- I should probably take this.

812
01:01:37,681 --> 01:01:40,299
Hello. Hi.

813
01:01:54,353 --> 01:01:57,255
I can't. I can't today.

814
01:01:59,185 --> 01:02:02,894
Sophie, Olivia, Amanda.

815
01:02:03,952 --> 01:02:05,415
Busy guy.

816
01:02:17,584 --> 01:02:20,454
- I think we should go into town.
- What do you mean?

817
01:02:20,656 --> 01:02:22,249
I think you should get dressed.

818
01:02:22,449 --> 01:02:26,343
We should take a drive, get some
lunch and get to know each other.

819
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:29,032
Really? Why?

820
01:02:29,232 --> 01:02:32,297
Because I'm running out of reasons
why we shouldn't.

821
01:02:32,497 --> 01:02:33,957
Arert you?

822
01:03:03,664 --> 01:03:06,152
- So you're a book editor.
- Yes, I am.

823
01:03:06,353 --> 01:03:09,386
- What kind of an editor are you?
- A very mean one.

824
01:03:09,584 --> 01:03:12,585
No. What I meant was,
do you give massive notes, or...

825
01:03:12,785 --> 01:03:14,345
The better the writer,
the less notes.

826
01:03:14,544 --> 01:03:17,359
- And what'd you study in school?
- Literature.

827
01:03:17,552 --> 01:03:19,918
And did you always know
this was what you wanted to do?

828
01:03:20,111 --> 01:03:22,698
Okay, my palms
are starting to sweat.

829
01:03:22,896 --> 01:03:24,619
I feel like I'm on a job interview.

830
01:03:24,816 --> 01:03:27,183
Do you, by any chance,
know how to be on a date?

831
01:03:27,376 --> 01:03:29,743
- Sorry. I'm interrogating you.
- Yes.

832
01:03:30,096 --> 01:03:33,641
I haven't been on a first date
in a long time.

833
01:03:34,575 --> 01:03:37,675
Well, since we've already had sex
and slept together twice...

834
01:03:37,872 --> 01:03:40,044
...maybe we can bend
the first-date rules.

835
01:03:40,560 --> 01:03:41,804
Why are you blushing?

836
01:03:42,481 --> 01:03:45,066
I didn't realize I was.
I think you make me nervous.

837
01:03:46,191 --> 01:03:50,632
Okay. I'm gonna try to be myself.
It's never easy, but I'm gonna try.

838
01:03:51,921 --> 01:03:53,927
What was the question? Oh, I know.

839
01:03:54,127 --> 01:03:56,549
- Did I always want to be a book editor?
- Did you...? Right.

840
01:03:56,752 --> 01:03:58,694
The answer is yes.
My family's in publishing.

841
01:03:58,896 --> 01:04:00,619
My dad's a writer
of historical fiction.

842
01:04:00,816 --> 01:04:02,157
My mum was...

843
01:04:02,351 --> 01:04:05,668
Is, to this day, a very important editor
at Random House.

844
01:04:05,873 --> 01:04:09,418
Okay. I believe my time is up.
Your turn.

845
01:04:09,616 --> 01:04:11,078
Really?

846
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:12,655
- Deep breath.
- Okay.

847
01:04:13,968 --> 01:04:15,756
- All right?
- Yeah.

848
01:04:16,240 --> 01:04:17,734
Well, like I said the other night...

849
01:04:17,935 --> 01:04:20,238
...I own a company
that does movie advertising.

850
01:04:20,433 --> 01:04:22,091
I didn't realize
you own the company.

851
01:04:22,288 --> 01:04:23,881
Probably because
I didn't mention it.

852
01:04:24,079 --> 01:04:26,982
But now that I know you were raised
by such a strong working mom...

853
01:04:27,184 --> 01:04:29,485
...I can say it,
and maybe you won't be intimidated.

854
01:04:29,680 --> 01:04:31,720
No, no.
I'm still a little intimidated by it.

855
01:04:31,919 --> 01:04:34,122
Well, "a little"
is way ahead of the curve.

856
01:04:35,952 --> 01:04:38,341
- Yeah.
- What about your family?

857
01:04:39,312 --> 01:04:41,319
Okay, I'll say it fast.

858
01:04:42,447 --> 01:04:44,520
My parents broke up when I was 15.

859
01:04:45,232 --> 01:04:48,973
I'm an only child, and l...
I didn't see it coming.

860
01:04:49,168 --> 01:04:50,477
You know, we were really close.

861
01:04:50,672 --> 01:04:53,901
We used to call ourselves
"The Three Musketeers."

862
01:04:54,384 --> 01:04:57,516
And one night after dinner,
my parents sat me down...

863
01:04:57,712 --> 01:05:00,167
...and told me that
they were breaking up.

864
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:02,607
I thought they were kidding.

865
01:05:03,503 --> 01:05:07,846
And then I saw a suitcase out of
the corner of my eye in the hallway.

866
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:10,788
And my dad moved out that night.

867
01:05:12,687 --> 01:05:16,070
I think I cried myself to sleep
for, like, well...

868
01:05:16,271 --> 01:05:18,758
Anyway, a long time.

869
01:05:18,959 --> 01:05:22,920
And then I realized
that I'd better toughen up.

870
01:05:23,120 --> 01:05:28,105
And, well, I got through it
and sort of haven't cried since.

871
01:05:28,623 --> 01:05:32,071
I also haven't thought of
that packed suitcase maybe ever.

872
01:05:33,359 --> 01:05:35,082
And that's my tragic little story.

873
01:05:35,727 --> 01:05:37,550
- Let's order.
- Wait.

874
01:05:37,744 --> 01:05:39,239
You haven't cried
since you were 15?

875
01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:43,181
I know it must mean something awful.
I know, but...

876
01:05:43,376 --> 01:05:46,539
You know, I try, but... Believe me.

877
01:05:46,736 --> 01:05:49,605
But can we talk about you
some more, please?

878
01:05:49,807 --> 01:05:53,452
Okay. Yes. Absolutely. Okay.
Well, I cry all the time.

879
01:05:53,648 --> 01:05:55,687
- You do not.
- Yeah, I do.

880
01:05:55,887 --> 01:05:57,545
More than any woman
you've ever met.

881
01:05:57,744 --> 01:05:59,566
You don't have to be this nice.

882
01:06:00,272 --> 01:06:01,865
- It happens to be the truth.
- Really?

883
01:06:02,063 --> 01:06:06,155
A good book, a great film,
a birthday card, I weep.

884
01:06:06,351 --> 01:06:08,620
- Shut up.
- I'm a major weeper.

885
01:06:08,816 --> 01:06:09,928
I am.

886
01:07:03,343 --> 01:07:06,856
- This was such a great afternoon.
- It was a really great afternoon.

887
01:07:07,055 --> 01:07:10,732
You know, you don't have
to walk me in. It's freezing, and...

888
01:07:11,470 --> 01:07:13,358
You can just say
you don't want me to come in.

889
01:07:13,551 --> 01:07:16,006
No, it's not that. I just... No...

890
01:07:16,207 --> 01:07:19,273
I'm just tired.
I think I'm gonna take a nap.

891
01:07:19,470 --> 01:07:21,741
- It's not that.
- Okay, I'll pretend I believe you.

892
01:07:22,767 --> 01:07:26,182
Graham, I'm leaving in nine days.

893
01:07:26,382 --> 01:07:28,837
And that makes this complicated.

894
01:07:29,039 --> 01:07:32,072
And I'm not sure I can handle
complicated right now.

895
01:07:35,631 --> 01:07:37,125
Okay.

896
01:07:48,174 --> 01:07:50,859
And that doesn't make things
complicated?

897
01:07:51,375 --> 01:07:53,644
Sex makes everything complicated.

898
01:07:53,839 --> 01:07:57,668
Even when you don't have it, the not
having it makes things complicated.

899
01:07:57,871 --> 01:08:01,383
Which is why it's usually better
to have it. Some say.

900
01:08:06,511 --> 01:08:08,715
Well, I'm off to work in the morning.

901
01:08:08,911 --> 01:08:12,107
I promise I won't be drunkenly
banging on your door any time soon.

902
01:08:13,166 --> 01:08:15,981
We'll see each other, okay?
We'll figure something out.

903
01:08:16,462 --> 01:08:18,372
- Good.
- Good.

904
01:08:28,015 --> 01:08:29,193
Oh, it's freezing.

905
01:08:47,567 --> 01:08:49,955
- Hi.
- Hello.

906
01:08:50,159 --> 01:08:52,580
- Bad timing?
- No, no. Come in.

907
01:08:53,262 --> 01:08:55,815
- How's it going?
- Good. Yeah, everything's good.

908
01:08:56,014 --> 01:08:57,443
This fedEx was leaning
on the gate.

909
01:08:57,647 --> 01:09:00,264
From a little town
called London, England.

910
01:09:02,511 --> 01:09:06,701
Friend of mine's writing a book,
and I give him...

911
01:09:07,983 --> 01:09:10,918
...notes sometimes.

912
01:09:13,262 --> 01:09:16,840
- You have company?
- I'm having a little Hanukkah party.

913
01:09:17,806 --> 01:09:19,660
Did you join a temple
since I last saw you?

914
01:09:20,431 --> 01:09:22,951
No. My neighbor knew
I didn't know anyone here.

915
01:09:23,150 --> 01:09:25,517
So he wanted to introduce me
to some of his friends.

916
01:09:25,710 --> 01:09:28,077
And somehow it turned into
a Hanukkah thing.

917
01:09:28,526 --> 01:09:30,053
Do you wanna come in for a sec?

918
01:09:30,254 --> 01:09:33,800
All right. Yeah.
I could play spin the dreidel.

919
01:09:34,318 --> 01:09:35,463
Smells good.

920
01:09:35,663 --> 01:09:38,826
I just have to say, this is one of
the best Hanukkahs I've ever had.

921
01:09:39,022 --> 01:09:40,266
Hear, hear.

922
01:09:40,462 --> 01:09:43,811
I've had too much of the Manischewitz.
I'm gonna have to be cut off.

923
01:09:44,013 --> 01:09:46,501
We are cutting you off.

924
01:09:46,702 --> 01:09:49,320
I take this very seriously,
and I'm telling you the truth.

925
01:09:49,517 --> 01:09:51,427
He amazes me.

926
01:09:51,630 --> 01:09:53,288
Don't listen to them. They're nuts.

927
01:09:53,487 --> 01:09:57,130
Okay, so you're telling me
you were not a ladies' man?

928
01:09:57,326 --> 01:09:59,715
Never. I married very young.

929
01:09:59,918 --> 01:10:02,057
Yes, only because
he had the greatest girl in town.

930
01:10:02,253 --> 01:10:04,075
He had to take her off the market.

931
01:10:04,269 --> 01:10:07,587
- That's the truth.
- Everyone loved Marion.

932
01:10:07,791 --> 01:10:09,351
She had the greatest laugh.

933
01:10:09,870 --> 01:10:12,259
What did he say?
She had the greatest ass?

934
01:10:13,582 --> 01:10:14,955
Greatest laugh.

935
01:10:16,142 --> 01:10:18,116
Although her ass
wasrt so bad, either.

936
01:10:19,437 --> 01:10:23,082
She had real gumption.
She was the girl I always wrote.

937
01:10:24,941 --> 01:10:28,290
What about you, Miles?
You're a man about town, I presume.

938
01:10:28,494 --> 01:10:32,934
No, gents, sadly I am not. I'm just
a one-woman-at-a-time kind of guy.

939
01:10:34,222 --> 01:10:38,500
Actually, I've been dating a beautiful
actress for about five months.

940
01:10:38,702 --> 01:10:42,313
I do not know what she sees in me,
but I'm the luckiest guy in the world.

941
01:10:42,830 --> 01:10:45,196
Oh, she's an actress?
What's she been in?

942
01:10:45,390 --> 01:10:48,204
- Anything we would have seen?
- She hasn't done that much yet, but...

943
01:10:48,398 --> 01:10:49,858
And where is she tonight?

944
01:10:50,350 --> 01:10:52,870
Look, he's half-dead,
and he's still interested.

945
01:10:53,070 --> 01:10:57,577
Well, I mean, that made me curious.
You know, he's here. Where is she?

946
01:10:57,774 --> 01:11:02,280
She's on location in New Mexico.
She's working on a little indie film.

947
01:11:02,476 --> 01:11:06,122
Sorry she couldn't be here.
She'll be back in about 10 days.

948
01:11:06,318 --> 01:11:07,878
Her loss is our gain.

949
01:11:08,654 --> 01:11:10,344
- Thank you, Arthur.
- Fellas...

950
01:11:10,542 --> 01:11:14,371
...I think we should leave these young
folks and get back to our bedpans.

951
01:11:16,846 --> 01:11:18,852
Okay, Norman,
you are calling me for pinochle.

952
01:11:19,052 --> 01:11:21,956
- I got your cell, I'll be in touch.
- Okay, pound right here.

953
01:11:26,637 --> 01:11:29,452
This was an amazing night.

954
01:11:29,646 --> 01:11:32,395
Arthur Abbott is maybe the last
of the great Hollywood writers...

955
01:11:32,589 --> 01:11:33,930
...from that generation. Thanks.

956
01:11:34,125 --> 01:11:36,941
There are, like, famous things we say
because he wrote them.

957
01:11:37,134 --> 01:11:40,102
I know. He told me
that his friends wrote Casablanca...

958
01:11:40,302 --> 01:11:43,946
...but that he added the "kid"
to "Here's looking at you, kid."

959
01:11:44,141 --> 01:11:46,629
Hello! Which totally makes the line.

960
01:11:46,830 --> 01:11:49,513
"Here's looking at you, llsa."

961
01:11:49,709 --> 01:11:51,401
Doesrt quite have that ring.

962
01:11:51,597 --> 01:11:55,819
He's so modest. He gave me this long
list of old movies he said I had to see.

963
01:11:56,014 --> 01:11:57,508
None were written by him,
of course.

964
01:11:57,709 --> 01:12:00,229
I saw a couple today.
They were fantastic.

965
01:12:00,429 --> 01:12:01,989
Maybe we can see one together.

966
01:12:02,189 --> 01:12:05,060
- That would be great.
- All right, cool.

967
01:12:05,614 --> 01:12:06,858
Then I'll definitely call you.

968
01:12:08,973 --> 01:12:12,552
The brisket was great. And those
chocolate-covered macaroons.

969
01:12:12,750 --> 01:12:15,914
Delectable. It was really fun
hanging with you.

970
01:12:16,621 --> 01:12:19,207
Okay. I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to kiss you twice...

971
01:12:19,405 --> 01:12:21,478
...and then linger a long time
on the second kiss.

972
01:12:21,678 --> 01:12:23,979
- No problem.
- Oh, boy.

973
01:12:27,117 --> 01:12:28,611
It is officially crazy weather.

974
01:12:34,028 --> 01:12:35,175
Don't blow away.

975
01:12:52,429 --> 01:12:55,048
"I'm not sure
I can handle complicated"?

976
01:12:55,246 --> 01:12:57,318
Oh, God, I can be such a jerk.

977
01:12:57,518 --> 01:13:00,616
- Amanda Woods.
- Shut up.

978
01:13:00,812 --> 01:13:04,008
She pushed every guy away,
every time.

979
01:13:04,205 --> 01:13:07,915
It' not, "Will she ever change,"
but, "Does she want to?"

980
01:13:44,397 --> 01:13:47,779
- Surprise.
- Yeah, it is. Hi.

981
01:13:47,981 --> 01:13:51,298
Hi. So I was home doing nothing
and thinking of you...

982
01:13:51,501 --> 01:13:54,403
...and I realized that a little
complication never hurt anyone.

983
01:13:54,605 --> 01:13:57,452
And then I thought,
maybe this isn't so complicated at all.

984
01:13:57,645 --> 01:13:59,304
And also, I wanted to apologize.

985
01:13:59,501 --> 01:14:01,922
I am sorry I didn't
invite you in this afternoon.

986
01:14:02,124 --> 01:14:04,131
I don't know what that
was about exactly...

987
01:14:04,332 --> 01:14:08,839
...but whatever it was,
I thought that I should just...

988
01:14:10,573 --> 01:14:13,672
Oh, my God. You're,
you're not alone, are you?

989
01:14:15,277 --> 01:14:16,422
No, I'm not, actually.

990
01:14:17,868 --> 01:14:19,428
- I'm sorry.
- No. No, no, no. Don't be.

991
01:14:19,628 --> 01:14:22,149
I shouldn't have just...
Oh, man.

992
01:14:22,349 --> 01:14:25,219
Okay, seriously,
do not worry about this.

993
01:14:25,421 --> 01:14:28,388
This is just me, like, being stupid.

994
01:14:30,092 --> 01:14:31,751
Who is it, Daddy?

995
01:14:33,613 --> 01:14:35,752
- "Daddy"?
- Yes.

996
01:14:35,949 --> 01:14:38,087
I am Daddy.

997
01:14:39,821 --> 01:14:42,187
Amanda, this is my
daughter Sophie.

998
01:14:42,380 --> 01:14:43,787
Soph, this is my friend Amanda.

999
01:14:43,981 --> 01:14:46,436
- Hi.
- How do you do?

1000
01:14:50,061 --> 01:14:52,515
I'm fine, thank you. How are you?

1001
01:14:53,036 --> 01:14:55,175
Very well, thank you.
Do you want to come in?

1002
01:14:55,373 --> 01:14:56,747
Oh, no, I just...

1003
01:14:57,484 --> 01:14:58,467
Hi.

1004
01:14:59,244 --> 01:15:00,389
Come here.

1005
01:15:01,515 --> 01:15:03,621
Daddy, who is this?

1006
01:15:03,820 --> 01:15:08,742
This is Amanda. And, Amanda,
this is my youngest. Olivia.

1007
01:15:13,996 --> 01:15:16,232
Sophie and Olivia.

1008
01:15:16,428 --> 01:15:17,835
Dad.

1009
01:15:18,028 --> 01:15:20,964
- Dad.
- Sorry, yes. Of course, come in.

1010
01:15:21,165 --> 01:15:22,540
Come in.

1011
01:15:25,197 --> 01:15:26,625
Okay.

1012
01:15:32,876 --> 01:15:35,691
Daddy, can we still have
hot chocolate, please?

1013
01:15:35,885 --> 01:15:37,641
- Yes.
- With baby marshmallows?

1014
01:15:37,837 --> 01:15:39,364
Yes.

1015
01:15:49,261 --> 01:15:51,149
Dad, take her coat.

1016
01:15:51,821 --> 01:15:55,497
- Yes. May I, may I...
- Oh, sure. Thanks.

1017
01:15:55,692 --> 01:15:58,474
Are you married? Tell me fast.

1018
01:15:58,668 --> 01:16:00,195
- No.
- Okay.

1019
01:16:03,819 --> 01:16:05,861
I know. I'm a tad overdressed.

1020
01:16:06,061 --> 01:16:07,948
You look like my Barbie.

1021
01:16:10,925 --> 01:16:12,997
- Thanks.
- Is that for us?

1022
01:16:14,348 --> 01:16:17,730
Yes. Except for I'm sorry
about the wine.

1023
01:16:25,643 --> 01:16:28,196
I apologize for not
having mentioned this earlier.

1024
01:16:28,396 --> 01:16:31,265
You're D-l-V-O-R-C-E-D?

1025
01:16:33,227 --> 01:16:36,741
W-l-D-O-W-E-R.

1026
01:16:37,292 --> 01:16:38,950
Two years ago.

1027
01:16:42,923 --> 01:16:47,113
Amanda, are you by any chance
at all into hot chocolate?

1028
01:16:49,260 --> 01:16:52,010
As a matter of fact, I'm...

1029
01:16:52,492 --> 01:16:54,216
...totally into it.

1030
01:16:54,604 --> 01:16:57,059
- Here we go, Olivia. Olivia...
- Thank you.

1031
01:16:57,260 --> 01:16:58,471
...blow on it. It's hot.

1032
01:17:00,588 --> 01:17:02,213
You too, Soph.

1033
01:17:02,540 --> 01:17:04,000
She has more marshmallows
than me.

1034
01:17:04,204 --> 01:17:06,026
No, she doesn't.
You each have five.

1035
01:17:06,604 --> 01:17:08,547
- You have five too.
- Thank you.

1036
01:17:08,748 --> 01:17:11,748
One, two, three, four, five.

1037
01:17:16,812 --> 01:17:18,851
What? Do I have something
on my lip?

1038
01:17:19,627 --> 01:17:21,189
Just look! There.

1039
01:17:23,340 --> 01:17:25,195
- Oh, hello.
- Hello.

1040
01:17:25,388 --> 01:17:28,289
- Hello.
- Going up! Blow on mine.

1041
01:17:30,252 --> 01:17:32,074
Thank you.

1042
01:17:32,267 --> 01:17:33,413
Excellent timing.

1043
01:17:34,154 --> 01:17:37,003
Dad, do Mr. Napkin Head.

1044
01:17:37,196 --> 01:17:39,584
- No. No, no, no. No Mr. Napkin Head.
- Please? Do it!

1045
01:17:39,788 --> 01:17:43,083
- Do it. Do it. Please.
- Do it, please. Beg you, please?

1046
01:17:43,275 --> 01:17:45,927
Please? Okay, I'll do it quickly.

1047
01:17:46,124 --> 01:17:48,644
- Oh, well, thank you for that.
- You're welcome. Now do it.

1048
01:17:48,843 --> 01:17:50,306
All right.

1049
01:17:51,499 --> 01:17:54,085
Amanda, can I borrow
your napkin, please?

1050
01:17:54,284 --> 01:17:55,461
Yes.

1051
01:17:55,884 --> 01:17:57,257
Your glasses.

1052
01:17:57,451 --> 01:17:58,858
Pass me those when I need them.

1053
01:17:59,051 --> 01:18:01,157
Amanda, you're gonna love this.

1054
01:18:01,355 --> 01:18:05,512
It's so funny. I mean, you'll fall
off your chair, it's so funny.

1055
01:18:06,572 --> 01:18:08,066
Hello.

1056
01:18:10,188 --> 01:18:12,904
Hello, my name is Mr. Napkin Head.

1057
01:18:13,708 --> 01:18:16,228
- Hello, children.
- Who's this? She's a stranger?

1058
01:18:16,427 --> 01:18:18,696
- Amanda.
- And why has she got a funny accent?

1059
01:18:18,891 --> 01:18:21,281
- Amanda.
- Yeah, but where is she from?

1060
01:18:22,700 --> 01:18:25,667
Now smoke!

1061
01:18:26,444 --> 01:18:28,102
Go on.

1062
01:18:32,075 --> 01:18:33,897
Smoking's really bad for you.

1063
01:18:36,172 --> 01:18:38,113
Amanda, guess what.

1064
01:18:38,315 --> 01:18:41,066
We have a tent in our playroom.
Do you want to see it?

1065
01:18:41,259 --> 01:18:43,168
No, no, no. Amanda...

1066
01:18:43,372 --> 01:18:46,437
...will not crawl into your tent.

1067
01:18:46,955 --> 01:18:49,825
You don't like tents?

1068
01:18:58,827 --> 01:19:00,999
Okay, this is seriously cool.

1069
01:19:01,195 --> 01:19:03,082
Come inside.

1070
01:19:06,667 --> 01:19:07,943
- Lie down.
- Okay.

1071
01:19:08,139 --> 01:19:10,921
Here, Amanda.
You can use my pillow.

1072
01:19:11,115 --> 01:19:12,544
- Thank you.
- Lie down!

1073
01:19:12,747 --> 01:19:14,470
Can you please
stop being so bossy?

1074
01:19:14,667 --> 01:19:18,015
- Lie down, please, next to me.
- Okay.

1075
01:19:22,828 --> 01:19:25,031
Very nice.

1076
01:19:25,675 --> 01:19:27,780
Excuse me.

1077
01:19:30,411 --> 01:19:33,727
This is an exceptionally great tent.

1078
01:19:33,931 --> 01:19:35,208
It's got something, hasn't it?

1079
01:19:35,404 --> 01:19:38,305
- It's cozy.
- Yeah.

1080
01:19:38,507 --> 01:19:40,579
Who cut out
all these beautiful stars?

1081
01:19:41,163 --> 01:19:43,749
- We did.
- The Three Musketeers!

1082
01:19:54,699 --> 01:19:56,074
Amanda?

1083
01:19:56,650 --> 01:19:58,919
- Yes?
- You smell lovely.

1084
01:19:59,114 --> 01:20:00,260
Do I?

1085
01:20:00,459 --> 01:20:04,966
Yes. I love perfume,
but he won't let me wear it.

1086
01:20:05,164 --> 01:20:07,880
Because you already smell so good.

1087
01:20:08,075 --> 01:20:10,595
- So do you, by the way.
- Thanks.

1088
01:20:10,794 --> 01:20:14,340
- But I'm older, so I guess I'm allowed.
- Exactly.

1089
01:20:14,923 --> 01:20:16,963
I like your eye shadow.

1090
01:20:17,162 --> 01:20:18,472
Thank you.

1091
01:20:18,986 --> 01:20:21,321
- And your lipstick.
- Thank you.

1092
01:20:21,515 --> 01:20:24,362
- It's new.
- What's it called?

1093
01:20:24,555 --> 01:20:28,002
I think it's called Berry Kiss.

1094
01:20:28,203 --> 01:20:30,690
Very Berry Kiss it is.

1095
01:20:32,043 --> 01:20:34,017
Berry Kiss.

1096
01:20:35,531 --> 01:20:37,898
Let's see? It looks good on you.

1097
01:20:38,091 --> 01:20:39,301
Amanda?

1098
01:20:40,587 --> 01:20:43,816
You know, if you wanted to sleep over,
that would be all right.

1099
01:20:44,010 --> 01:20:45,472
We could push our beds together.

1100
01:20:46,891 --> 01:20:48,451
Sorry.

1101
01:20:49,419 --> 01:20:51,274
That's so sweet of you
to invite me...

1102
01:20:51,466 --> 01:20:54,762
...but maybe another time.
Would that be all right?

1103
01:20:55,275 --> 01:20:56,802
Yes.

1104
01:20:59,307 --> 01:21:01,095
Good girl.

1105
01:21:04,394 --> 01:21:07,427
We never have grownups here
that are girls.

1106
01:21:07,947 --> 01:21:08,994
I know.

1107
01:21:09,546 --> 01:21:11,335
I really like it.

1108
01:21:11,530 --> 01:21:14,018
Me too.

1109
01:21:32,266 --> 01:21:35,398
I can't imagine anyone being
a bigger hit with my children.

1110
01:21:37,227 --> 01:21:38,438
They're really great, Graham.

1111
01:21:39,243 --> 01:21:42,025
Sophie's unfortunately taken
on the role as my protector.

1112
01:21:42,218 --> 01:21:45,350
She's brilliant, but I hate it
when she worries about me.

1113
01:21:45,546 --> 01:21:47,073
And Olivia's...

1114
01:21:47,274 --> 01:21:49,379
...gonna be a real ball-buster.

1115
01:21:49,579 --> 01:21:52,447
Which, I must admit,
I kind of love about her.

1116
01:21:53,387 --> 01:21:55,907
I'm trying to figure out
why you didn't tell me about them.

1117
01:21:57,899 --> 01:22:00,354
Because I just don't usually
tell women about them.

1118
01:22:00,554 --> 01:22:02,441
But it's just a little confusing...

1119
01:22:02,634 --> 01:22:05,156
...because you're the one
who wanted to go out to lunch...

1120
01:22:05,355 --> 01:22:06,784
...to get to know one another.

1121
01:22:06,987 --> 01:22:09,834
When you put it that way,
it sounds awful.

1122
01:22:10,250 --> 01:22:14,505
I have no defense. Except that until
I get to know someone really well...

1123
01:22:14,698 --> 01:22:16,967
...it's easier for me to
be a normal, single guy.

1124
01:22:17,162 --> 01:22:20,937
Because it's way too complicated
to be who I really am.

1125
01:22:21,450 --> 01:22:23,272
I'm a full-time dad.

1126
01:22:23,466 --> 01:22:26,564
I'm a working parent.
I'm a mother and a father.

1127
01:22:26,762 --> 01:22:30,690
I'm a guy who reads parenting books
and cookbooks before I go to sleep.

1128
01:22:30,891 --> 01:22:34,239
I spend my weekends buying tutus.
I'm learning to sew.

1129
01:22:34,442 --> 01:22:36,003
I'm Mr. Napkin Head!

1130
01:22:36,202 --> 01:22:39,911
I'm on some kind of
constant overload and it helps...

1131
01:22:40,809 --> 01:22:44,606
...to compartmentalize my life.
Just till I figure this out.

1132
01:22:45,226 --> 01:22:47,844
This past weekend, the children
were with their grandparents.

1133
01:22:48,394 --> 01:22:50,980
And when they're gone,
I get to be somebody...

1134
01:22:51,178 --> 01:22:54,211
...who doesn't have hot chocolate
spilled on his jeans.

1135
01:22:55,049 --> 01:22:58,661
I have no idea how to date
and be this.

1136
01:22:59,082 --> 01:23:01,024
And I suppose there's...

1137
01:23:02,250 --> 01:23:04,552
...the possibility I'm afraid
of what another person...

1138
01:23:04,746 --> 01:23:06,851
...might do to who we are...

1139
01:23:07,050 --> 01:23:09,385
...and how we get from
one day to the next.

1140
01:23:13,897 --> 01:23:15,174
Yeah.

1141
01:23:16,265 --> 01:23:19,364
I guess since I am
leaving in a week, I...

1142
01:23:20,235 --> 01:23:22,503
I sort of get you not telling me.

1143
01:23:23,370 --> 01:23:26,370
- Sort of.
- I thought it would be hard...

1144
01:23:26,570 --> 01:23:29,320
...to introduce them to someone
I may never see again.

1145
01:23:34,666 --> 01:23:36,040
Right.

1146
01:23:36,522 --> 01:23:40,712
Because I'm just someone you had
sex with once and slept with twice.

1147
01:23:40,906 --> 01:23:45,248
I thought I was just someone you had
sex with once and slept with twice.

1148
01:23:45,450 --> 01:23:47,075
Oh, man.

1149
01:23:48,746 --> 01:23:51,168
I think we just went
way past complicated.

1150
01:23:51,370 --> 01:23:55,526
Right. I'm a book editor
from London. You're a...

1151
01:23:56,297 --> 01:23:57,824
...beautiful...

1152
01:23:58,025 --> 01:24:00,993
...movie trailer-maker from L.A.

1153
01:24:01,834 --> 01:24:03,972
We're worlds apart.

1154
01:24:04,746 --> 01:24:06,720
I have a cow in the back yard.

1155
01:24:07,370 --> 01:24:09,060
- You have a cow?
- Yeah.

1156
01:24:09,258 --> 01:24:11,811
I sew and I have a cow.

1157
01:24:12,009 --> 01:24:14,376
How's that for hard to relate to?

1158
01:24:18,249 --> 01:24:20,073
Pretty up there.

1159
01:24:21,545 --> 01:24:23,105
Exactly.

1160
01:24:36,234 --> 01:24:37,728
- Morning, Jesus.
- Good morning.

1161
01:24:37,929 --> 01:24:39,751
- Santa Anas?
- Oh, yeah, long time now.

1162
01:24:39,945 --> 01:24:42,214
- Hi, Marta.
- Hi, Iris.

1163
01:24:45,290 --> 01:24:46,663
Hi there.

1164
01:24:47,593 --> 01:24:49,185
Hello!

1165
01:24:50,154 --> 01:24:51,495
Good morning.

1166
01:24:51,689 --> 01:24:53,347
I counted.

1167
01:24:53,546 --> 01:24:55,684
Nine movies are opening today.

1168
01:24:55,881 --> 01:24:58,598
I remember when nine movies
would open in a month.

1169
01:24:58,793 --> 01:25:04,127
Now a picture has to make a killing
the first weekend or they're dead.

1170
01:25:04,329 --> 01:25:07,013
This is supposed to be conducive
to great work?

1171
01:25:07,210 --> 01:25:10,374
Arthur, have you always
been this feisty?

1172
01:25:10,569 --> 01:25:13,569
Well, I may have slowed down
a little, but yes.

1173
01:25:13,769 --> 01:25:15,973
You've gotta fight the fight, kid.

1174
01:25:16,937 --> 01:25:17,984
Okay, your mail.

1175
01:25:18,538 --> 01:25:21,571
Gas company, phone bill.

1176
01:25:21,770 --> 01:25:25,185
And a letter from the
Writers Guild of America, West.

1177
01:25:28,105 --> 01:25:29,959
Are you watching the movies
I recommended?

1178
01:25:30,154 --> 01:25:33,950
Yes! Love them.
Irene Dunne is fantastic.

1179
01:25:34,152 --> 01:25:37,284
- Gumption.
- Oh, my God, tons of it.

1180
01:25:37,865 --> 01:25:40,767
Arthur, don't you want to open that
letter you just threw in the bin?

1181
01:25:40,970 --> 01:25:43,358
No. They keep writing me
about the same thing.

1182
01:25:43,561 --> 01:25:45,022
But it might be important.

1183
01:25:45,225 --> 01:25:49,862
It's not. They want to arrange
some kind of tribute to me.

1184
01:25:50,057 --> 01:25:51,749
A night with me.

1185
01:25:51,945 --> 01:25:53,506
I don't know. It sounds God-awful.

1186
01:25:53,705 --> 01:25:56,454
What are you talking about?
That sounds brilliant!

1187
01:25:56,648 --> 01:26:02,213
Would you like to walk out on a stage,
on a walker, looking 100 years old...

1188
01:26:02,408 --> 01:26:05,224
...and see 11 schnooks
who showed up just to see you?

1189
01:26:05,418 --> 01:26:07,108
They can forget it.

1190
01:26:07,305 --> 01:26:09,093
I ain't falling for this.

1191
01:26:09,289 --> 01:26:12,585
So now, what's up?

1192
01:26:12,969 --> 01:26:14,430
May I?

1193
01:26:19,529 --> 01:26:21,416
"An Evening With Arthur Abbott."

1194
01:26:23,081 --> 01:26:26,496
"Dear Mr. Abbott...... several
attempts to contact you regarding..."

1195
01:26:26,697 --> 01:26:29,512
"We have not yet received
your response.

1196
01:26:30,537 --> 01:26:32,904
This special night
will be a tribute to your...

1197
01:26:33,096 --> 01:26:36,992
...lifetime screenwriting achievement
and contribution to the profession.

1198
01:26:37,193 --> 01:26:40,040
Congratulations on this
much-deserved honor."

1199
01:26:40,681 --> 01:26:42,404
Arthur, this is a big deal.

1200
01:26:42,601 --> 01:26:44,673
You know, and they want
to do this soon.

1201
01:26:45,512 --> 01:26:48,644
Listen, I reckon
that with a little bit of exercise...

1202
01:26:48,840 --> 01:26:50,434
...you could walk out on your own.

1203
01:26:50,633 --> 01:26:53,088
And, you know,
maybe I could go with you.

1204
01:26:53,288 --> 01:26:56,256
As, like, your date or something.

1205
01:26:56,457 --> 01:26:59,904
I would take you proudly,
my darling, but I'm not going.

1206
01:27:00,744 --> 01:27:05,252
Anyway, how would you propose
to get me in shape? Seriously.

1207
01:27:06,409 --> 01:27:07,620
Easy.

1208
01:27:08,681 --> 01:27:10,753
You're doing really well.

1209
01:27:10,953 --> 01:27:14,499
Nearly there. Nearly there.
Nearly there.

1210
01:27:14,697 --> 01:27:17,958
Bravo! Here we go,
back the other way.

1211
01:27:23,721 --> 01:27:25,663
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

1212
01:27:25,864 --> 01:27:28,231
- You sure?
- Yeah, I just slipped.

1213
01:27:48,168 --> 01:27:50,308
- Hello?
- So are you ever coming home?

1214
01:27:50,505 --> 01:27:52,610
- Oh, my God. Hi.
- How's it going?

1215
01:27:52,809 --> 01:27:54,182
Great. I met a really nice guy.

1216
01:27:54,377 --> 01:27:56,547
See? And you said you'd never.
What's he like?

1217
01:27:56,744 --> 01:27:58,882
He's really cute. I feel great
when I'm with him...

1218
01:27:59,080 --> 01:28:02,942
...which is an entirely new experience.
And he's about 90 years old.

1219
01:28:03,144 --> 01:28:04,967
- Come on.
- He' my next-door neighbor.

1220
01:28:05,161 --> 01:28:08,227
Or Amanda's next-door neighbor.
By the way, you should go meet her.

1221
01:28:08,872 --> 01:28:12,417
- Yeah. I have, actually.
- Oh, bugger. Call waiting.

1222
01:28:12,616 --> 01:28:15,431
Can you hold for a sec? Hold on.
I really wanna talk to you.

1223
01:28:15,624 --> 01:28:17,347
- Sure.
- Hello.

1224
01:28:17,544 --> 01:28:20,611
- Iris, hi, it's Amanda.
- How are you? How's it going?

1225
01:28:20,808 --> 01:28:23,711
- Everything's great. How are you?
- Oh, I'm loving it.

1226
01:28:23,913 --> 01:28:26,247
Can you hold for a sec?
My brother's on the other line.

1227
01:28:26,440 --> 01:28:28,579
- Graham?
- Yes. He said you met.

1228
01:28:28,776 --> 01:28:32,005
- Yes, we did meet. How is he?
- Fine, I think.

1229
01:28:32,200 --> 01:28:33,793
- Can you just hold on for a sec?
- Sure.

1230
01:28:33,991 --> 01:28:37,472
- Okay. Hi, sorry. That was Amanda.
- How'd she sound?

1231
01:28:37,672 --> 01:28:40,038
- How is she doing?
- She just asked me how you are.

1232
01:28:40,233 --> 01:28:42,142
- And what did you say?
- I asked her to hold.

1233
01:28:42,344 --> 01:28:45,246
- Can I call you back?
- I can hold while you speak to her.

1234
01:28:45,448 --> 01:28:48,000
- Really?
- Find out how she is.

1235
01:28:48,200 --> 01:28:50,753
Okay. My brother wants to know
how you are.

1236
01:28:50,952 --> 01:28:54,846
Can you tell him I'm good and that
I'm just walking Charlie in the village.

1237
01:28:55,047 --> 01:28:57,666
- What's he been up to? Did he say?
- I'm not sure.

1238
01:28:57,864 --> 01:29:00,581
- Do you want me to ask him?
- Sure.

1239
01:29:01,192 --> 01:29:03,875
Okay. Hold, please.

1240
01:29:04,648 --> 01:29:08,030
I can't believe that you have had sex
with the woman staying in my house!

1241
01:29:08,904 --> 01:29:10,366
He told you that?

1242
01:29:10,568 --> 01:29:12,390
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God!

1243
01:29:12,583 --> 01:29:15,999
Oh, my God. I thought I was talking
to Graham! Can you just hold, please?

1244
01:29:16,200 --> 01:29:18,207
I'm terribly sorry.

1245
01:29:19,207 --> 01:29:20,735
I can't believe you
had sex with Amanda!

1246
01:29:20,937 --> 01:29:23,718
The one thing she asked me was,
"Are there any men in your town?"

1247
01:29:23,912 --> 01:29:25,570
I assured her that there were not.

1248
01:29:25,767 --> 01:29:28,189
Then you meet her and immediately
get into her knickers!

1249
01:29:29,159 --> 01:29:30,653
Still me.

1250
01:29:31,431 --> 01:29:33,471
Bollocks! I must have lost him.

1251
01:29:33,672 --> 01:29:36,934
Amanda, I am so sorry.

1252
01:29:37,896 --> 01:29:40,000
Can I call you back?

1253
01:29:40,200 --> 01:29:43,167
- Sure.
- Okay, bye.

1254
01:29:44,040 --> 01:29:45,950
Yes, hello.

1255
01:29:47,080 --> 01:29:48,868
It's Miles. Am I in trouble?

1256
01:29:49,416 --> 01:29:51,783
Oh, Miles. Hi.

1257
01:29:51,977 --> 01:29:53,537
What are you up to
this Christmas Eve?

1258
01:29:53,736 --> 01:29:55,623
Not much. But in a little bit...

1259
01:29:55,816 --> 01:29:58,947
...I 'm gonna go to the video shop
and get the next movie on Arthur's list.

1260
01:29:59,143 --> 01:30:00,834
Do you want some company?

1261
01:30:02,279 --> 01:30:03,621
Love some.

1262
01:30:04,744 --> 01:30:08,606
Hey, I got you the best drink
in town, but I didn't know...

1263
01:30:08,808 --> 01:30:11,491
...if you liked a little dollop
of whipped cream or a big one...

1264
01:30:11,688 --> 01:30:14,372
...so I got both and you can have
each one... Hello, big dollop!

1265
01:30:14,568 --> 01:30:16,455
- Say, you look great, by the way.
- Thanks.

1266
01:30:16,647 --> 01:30:18,654
- Really great.
- Thanks, I'm feeling good.

1267
01:30:18,855 --> 01:30:21,311
I've been working out with Arthur.

1268
01:30:21,512 --> 01:30:22,657
- What?
- No.

1269
01:30:22,856 --> 01:30:26,685
I'm sure it's an awesome workout.
I'm sorry. I'm trying not to picture it.

1270
01:30:26,888 --> 01:30:29,506
Okay, well, the workout's
not that great, but the conver...

1271
01:30:29,703 --> 01:30:30,913
Stop laughing!

1272
01:30:31,111 --> 01:30:35,106
- The conversation is truly fantastic.
- No, that I totally believe.

1273
01:30:35,304 --> 01:30:38,817
Now let me ask you.
Have you seen this?

1274
01:30:39,016 --> 01:30:41,220
Chariots of Fire. Loved it.

1275
01:30:46,952 --> 01:30:49,155
Such a great score by Vangelis.

1276
01:30:49,352 --> 01:30:52,515
He took electronic scores to a new
level. It was groundbreaking.

1277
01:30:52,712 --> 01:30:55,330
I'm gonna test you on this later.
Okay. Driving Miss Daisy.

1278
01:30:55,528 --> 01:30:58,691
Hans. Very unexpected.
Do you remember how great it was?

1279
01:31:04,647 --> 01:31:06,436
Sassy! Love it.

1280
01:31:06,631 --> 01:31:07,809
- Is this a bad game?
- No!

1281
01:31:08,008 --> 01:31:09,437
- Okay.
- Keep going.

1282
01:31:09,672 --> 01:31:11,908
Sometimes I get self-conscious
about my...

1283
01:31:14,855 --> 01:31:15,782
And:

1284
01:31:18,151 --> 01:31:23,748
Are you embarrassed
By this game I've started to play?

1285
01:31:23,943 --> 01:31:27,107
Okay. It's not a library.
I can go loud.

1286
01:31:29,862 --> 01:31:31,772
Two notes and you've got a villain.

1287
01:31:33,159 --> 01:31:35,265
I don't know what to say about it.
Totally brill.

1288
01:31:39,432 --> 01:31:42,748
I bet you didn't know that was all
written for the movie. It was a score.

1289
01:31:42,951 --> 01:31:44,707
- I did know that one.
- Can't go anywhere.

1290
01:31:44,903 --> 01:31:48,034
Oh, my God. Okay, this one?
You have to check this out some time.

1291
01:31:48,231 --> 01:31:50,337
The Mission.
The score is genius.

1292
01:31:50,535 --> 01:31:53,667
It just comes from
a totally different place. It's like...

1293
01:31:53,863 --> 01:31:57,408
I can't even... Just promise me
you'll rent it and listen to it.

1294
01:31:57,607 --> 01:31:59,199
- Renting.
- Thank you.

1295
01:31:59,399 --> 01:32:00,348
It changed my world.

1296
01:32:08,135 --> 01:32:09,564
What?

1297
01:32:14,439 --> 01:32:15,900
Maggie!

1298
01:32:30,438 --> 01:32:34,781
- Why do I always fall for the bad girl?
- You didn't know she was a bad girl.

1299
01:32:35,783 --> 01:32:37,922
I knew she wasrt good.

1300
01:32:38,247 --> 01:32:41,247
Do you have anything
a little bit stronger?

1301
01:32:42,087 --> 01:32:45,665
Thank you. Let me rephrase this:

1302
01:32:48,294 --> 01:32:51,907
Why am I attracted to a person
I know isn't good?

1303
01:32:52,808 --> 01:32:56,484
I happen to know the answer to this.
You're hoping you're wrong.

1304
01:32:56,678 --> 01:32:59,330
She does something that tells you
she's no good, you ignore it.

1305
01:32:59,527 --> 01:33:02,461
Every time she comes through and
surprises you, she wins you over...

1306
01:33:02,663 --> 01:33:06,144
...and you lose that argument
with yourself that she's not for you.

1307
01:33:06,566 --> 01:33:07,494
Exactly.

1308
01:33:08,647 --> 01:33:10,469
And on top of that,
there's the old standby:

1309
01:33:10,662 --> 01:33:13,565
"I can't believe a girl like that
would be with a guy like me."

1310
01:33:14,439 --> 01:33:16,032
You know what she said
to me tonight?

1311
01:33:16,550 --> 01:33:18,437
She finished in Santa fe
after two days...

1312
01:33:18,631 --> 01:33:20,770
...and has been staying with
whatever-his-name-was.

1313
01:33:20,967 --> 01:33:22,822
Which means she's been
right here in town.

1314
01:33:23,271 --> 01:33:25,823
When I spoke to her this morning
on her cell and she said:

1315
01:33:26,023 --> 01:33:28,062
"I'm looking out my window
and it's snowing."

1316
01:33:28,262 --> 01:33:30,684
She was in Santa Monica.

1317
01:33:30,917 --> 01:33:32,609
What did she do,
go to Weather. Com?

1318
01:33:32,806 --> 01:33:34,814
That must have made them
scream with laughter.

1319
01:33:35,014 --> 01:33:38,757
And in the meantime, I sent her
Christmas gift to Santa fe yesterday.

1320
01:33:38,950 --> 01:33:42,528
I stood in line at fedEx
to make sure she got it on time.

1321
01:33:43,239 --> 01:33:45,344
Classic, right?

1322
01:33:46,150 --> 01:33:49,566
I don't wanna ruin your Christmas Eve.
You don't have to listen to this.

1323
01:33:49,766 --> 01:33:51,522
It's okay.

1324
01:33:52,198 --> 01:33:53,508
I like the company.

1325
01:33:58,438 --> 01:33:59,616
So how about some food?

1326
01:33:59,815 --> 01:34:02,270
Shall I make us
a little Christmas fettuccine?

1327
01:34:02,470 --> 01:34:05,471
- Sure.
- Listen.

1328
01:34:05,959 --> 01:34:09,570
I know it's hard to believe people
when they say, "I know how you feel."

1329
01:34:11,111 --> 01:34:13,696
But I actually know how you feel.

1330
01:34:15,110 --> 01:34:16,735
You see...

1331
01:34:17,605 --> 01:34:18,947
...I was...

1332
01:34:20,167 --> 01:34:23,167
...seeing someone back in London.

1333
01:34:23,559 --> 01:34:25,697
We worked for
the same newspaper.

1334
01:34:25,894 --> 01:34:30,237
And then I found out that he was
also seeing this other girl, Sarah...

1335
01:34:30,438 --> 01:34:33,154
...from the Circulation Department
on the 19th floor.

1336
01:34:34,054 --> 01:34:37,797
It turned out that he wasrt
in love with me like I thought.

1337
01:34:39,238 --> 01:34:42,554
What I'm trying to say is...

1338
01:34:42,759 --> 01:34:46,141
...I understand feeling
as small and as insignificant...

1339
01:34:46,342 --> 01:34:48,731
...as humanly possible.

1340
01:34:48,933 --> 01:34:53,407
How it can actually ache in places that
you didn't know you had inside you.

1341
01:34:54,662 --> 01:34:56,734
It doesn't matter how many
new haircuts you get...

1342
01:34:56,934 --> 01:34:58,843
...or gyms you join...

1343
01:34:59,366 --> 01:35:02,148
...or how many glasses of chardonnay
you drink with girlfriends.

1344
01:35:02,342 --> 01:35:05,757
You still go to bed every night
going over every detail...

1345
01:35:05,958 --> 01:35:11,293
...and wonder what you did wrong
or how you could have misunderstood.

1346
01:35:12,518 --> 01:35:14,406
And how in the hell,
for that brief moment...

1347
01:35:14,598 --> 01:35:16,768
...you could think that you were
that happy?

1348
01:35:16,966 --> 01:35:18,908
And sometimes you can
even convince yourself...

1349
01:35:19,110 --> 01:35:21,663
...that he'll see the light
and show up at your door.

1350
01:35:24,647 --> 01:35:26,337
And after all that...

1351
01:35:26,919 --> 01:35:29,820
...however long "all that" may be...

1352
01:35:30,789 --> 01:35:32,993
...you'll go somewhere new.

1353
01:35:33,286 --> 01:35:36,800
And you'll meet people who make you
feel won'thwhile again.

1354
01:35:37,958 --> 01:35:41,952
And little pieces of your soul
will finally come back.

1355
01:35:42,374 --> 01:35:43,716
And all that fuzzy stuff...

1356
01:35:45,925 --> 01:35:50,236
...those years of your life
that you wasted...

1357
01:35:52,806 --> 01:35:55,489
...that will eventually begin to fade.

1358
01:35:57,702 --> 01:35:58,629
Well, fuck.

1359
01:35:59,654 --> 01:36:01,377
You need this more than I do.

1360
01:36:04,230 --> 01:36:07,045
That's what you're doing here?
You're getting over somebody?

1361
01:36:07,238 --> 01:36:08,733
Yeah.

1362
01:36:09,382 --> 01:36:10,691
This is me in good shape.

1363
01:36:11,430 --> 01:36:13,535
Is this the guy who sent you pages
from his novel?

1364
01:36:14,085 --> 01:36:15,646
Yeah.

1365
01:36:16,422 --> 01:36:17,403
He needs me.

1366
01:36:18,150 --> 01:36:19,972
So he stays in touch?

1367
01:36:20,167 --> 01:36:22,435
All the time.

1368
01:36:22,630 --> 01:36:25,858
That makes it impossible to forget,
which is great for him, sucks for you.

1369
01:36:27,014 --> 01:36:29,249
You see how great your life is
compared to mine?

1370
01:36:30,534 --> 01:36:33,730
Okay, let's go.
I'm making you some fettuccine.

1371
01:36:33,925 --> 01:36:37,308
It is Christmas Eve, and we
are going to sit out on that patio...

1372
01:36:37,509 --> 01:36:39,964
...gonna make ourselves a little fire,
pop some bubbly...

1373
01:36:40,166 --> 01:36:43,461
...and we are gonna celebrate
being young and being alive.

1374
01:36:45,222 --> 01:36:47,010
You with me, Simpkins?

1375
01:36:48,293 --> 01:36:49,952
Miles.

1376
01:36:51,814 --> 01:36:54,147
You really are
an incredibly decent man.

1377
01:36:54,534 --> 01:36:56,290
I know.

1378
01:36:56,485 --> 01:36:59,168
That's always been my problem.

1379
01:38:11,397 --> 01:38:13,219
Hi.

1380
01:38:28,260 --> 01:38:30,595
Okay, here it is.

1381
01:38:30,788 --> 01:38:33,276
Arthur's theme.
I think this is really good.

1382
01:38:33,477 --> 01:38:34,590
- I'm serious.
- No, I know.

1383
01:38:34,789 --> 01:38:37,244
I'm making him a CD of this tune.
Every time he hears it...

1384
01:38:37,445 --> 01:38:39,998
...it should give him the confidence
to walk right out there.

1385
01:38:40,197 --> 01:38:41,277
- Okay?
- Yep.

1386
01:38:41,477 --> 01:38:43,070
Here we go.

1387
01:38:46,533 --> 01:38:48,354
Did I steal this?

1388
01:38:48,869 --> 01:38:51,837
- John Williams.
- I didn't write it, that's why.

1389
01:38:52,037 --> 01:38:53,411
- Okay, this is it for real.
- Okay.

1390
01:38:53,605 --> 01:38:55,099
- Here we go.
- Yep.

1391
01:38:56,165 --> 01:38:58,532
A little Arthur and the knights.

1392
01:39:02,884 --> 01:39:04,772
Right? It's cheeky.

1393
01:39:05,829 --> 01:39:08,131
It sounds like him.

1394
01:39:12,197 --> 01:39:13,855
I also wrote one
that sounds like you.

1395
01:39:16,388 --> 01:39:17,316
You did?

1396
01:39:19,590 --> 01:39:22,556
Iris, if you were a melody.

1397
01:39:28,325 --> 01:39:30,812
I used only the good notes.

1398
01:39:43,077 --> 01:39:46,557
Iris lives next door

1399
01:39:46,756 --> 01:39:51,907
To Arthur
He' a doodle-ee-doo

1400
01:39:52,101 --> 01:39:54,435
- And also a doodle-ee-doo
- Scroodle-ee-doo

1401
01:39:54,629 --> 01:39:57,018
- A scroodle-ee-doo? I didn't know that.
- Yeah.

1402
01:39:57,221 --> 01:39:58,814
- And froodle-ee-doo
- And froodle-ee-doo

1403
01:39:59,012 --> 01:40:00,637
We both said "froodle-ee."

1404
01:40:00,836 --> 01:40:02,243
I'm impressed.

1405
01:40:02,436 --> 01:40:03,582
You are a prodigy.

1406
01:40:03,780 --> 01:40:04,958
A "doodle" prodigy.

1407
01:40:05,158 --> 01:40:06,683
Swoodle-ee-doo

1408
01:40:20,100 --> 01:40:23,134
So you're totally great.

1409
01:40:25,700 --> 01:40:27,260
Yeah.

1410
01:40:27,460 --> 01:40:28,737
This is a bitch.

1411
01:40:31,268 --> 01:40:34,498
Well, you must come to London
all the time for work, right?

1412
01:40:34,693 --> 01:40:36,351
London?

1413
01:40:36,741 --> 01:40:38,170
Never.

1414
01:40:39,108 --> 01:40:40,635
New York?

1415
01:40:41,572 --> 01:40:44,190
Not really, but that's easier.
Do you go there often?

1416
01:40:44,836 --> 01:40:46,396
Rarely.

1417
01:40:46,820 --> 01:40:48,675
Long-distance relationships
can work.

1418
01:40:49,252 --> 01:40:50,845
Really? I can't make one work...

1419
01:40:51,045 --> 01:40:52,932
...when I live in the same house
with someone.

1420
01:40:53,124 --> 01:40:55,612
So this could be
a good solution for you.

1421
01:40:58,308 --> 01:41:00,218
Oh, man.

1422
01:41:02,852 --> 01:41:04,413
Okay.

1423
01:41:05,124 --> 01:41:06,586
Let's say we just make this happen.

1424
01:41:06,788 --> 01:41:09,057
We commit to flying back and forth
as much as we can.

1425
01:41:09,508 --> 01:41:11,395
Yes! It's doable, definitely.

1426
01:41:11,588 --> 01:41:14,784
And then let's say
in six months we hit a wall.

1427
01:41:14,980 --> 01:41:17,314
Like, I can't constantly
be away from work...

1428
01:41:17,508 --> 01:41:19,897
...or the girls can't deal with you
leaving so often.

1429
01:41:20,261 --> 01:41:23,075
And we start to feel the tension.
We know this isn't gonna work...

1430
01:41:23,268 --> 01:41:26,302
...so we start fighting because
we don't know what else to do.

1431
01:41:26,500 --> 01:41:28,508
And then, after a long, tearful...

1432
01:41:28,708 --> 01:41:30,366
At your end... . Phone call...

1433
01:41:30,563 --> 01:41:32,570
...we just... We say goodbye.
- Thank you.

1434
01:41:32,772 --> 01:41:35,871
That'll be it, for real. It's not like
we'll ever bump into each other.

1435
01:41:36,068 --> 01:41:38,785
And then what's left?
Two miserable people...

1436
01:41:38,980 --> 01:41:41,369
...feeling totally mashed up
and hurt.

1437
01:41:48,580 --> 01:41:50,174
Or...

1438
01:41:50,724 --> 01:41:52,382
Thank you.

1439
01:41:55,652 --> 01:41:57,506
Or maybe we should just...

1440
01:41:57,700 --> 01:42:01,376
...realize that what we've had these
past few weeks has been perfect.

1441
01:42:02,116 --> 01:42:04,123
And maybe it won't
get any better than this.

1442
01:42:04,325 --> 01:42:06,331
Maybe we're trying to figure
this thing out...

1443
01:42:06,532 --> 01:42:08,419
...because it makes us
feel good to feel this.

1444
01:42:08,612 --> 01:42:10,499
Maybe the fact
that I'm leaving in 8 hours...

1445
01:42:10,692 --> 01:42:14,467
...makes this far more exciting
than it might actually be.

1446
01:42:15,683 --> 01:42:17,025
Maybe.

1447
01:42:17,219 --> 01:42:20,188
You are, seriously,
the most depressing girl I've ever met.

1448
01:42:21,380 --> 01:42:23,136
I know.

1449
01:42:25,444 --> 01:42:27,353
I have another scenario for you.

1450
01:42:27,555 --> 01:42:29,944
- Good.
- I'm in love with you.

1451
01:42:35,524 --> 01:42:37,913
I apologize for the blunt delivery.

1452
01:42:38,500 --> 01:42:41,282
But as problematical as this...

1453
01:42:41,476 --> 01:42:44,345
...fact may be, I am in love.

1454
01:42:45,220 --> 01:42:46,147
With you.

1455
01:42:47,779 --> 01:42:49,635
I'm not feeling this
because you're leaving.

1456
01:42:49,828 --> 01:42:51,770
And not because it feels good
to feel this way.

1457
01:42:51,972 --> 01:42:55,681
Which, by the way, it does...
Or did, before you went off like that.

1458
01:42:55,875 --> 01:42:57,948
I can't figure out
the mathematics of this.

1459
01:42:58,147 --> 01:43:01,017
I just know I love you.

1460
01:43:01,219 --> 01:43:03,773
Can't believe how many times
I'm saying it.

1461
01:43:03,972 --> 01:43:07,321
And I never thought I'd feel this way
again, so that's pretty phenomenal.

1462
01:43:07,684 --> 01:43:11,328
And I realize I come
with a package deal:

1463
01:43:11,523 --> 01:43:14,043
Three for the price of one. And my...

1464
01:43:14,403 --> 01:43:17,720
...package, perhaps in the light of day,
isn't all that wonderful...

1465
01:43:17,924 --> 01:43:22,813
...but I finally know what I want,
and that, in itself, is a miracle.

1466
01:43:24,292 --> 01:43:26,267
And what I want...

1467
01:43:26,916 --> 01:43:28,344
...is you.

1468
01:43:38,147 --> 01:43:40,536
I wasrt expecting "I love you."

1469
01:43:47,715 --> 01:43:50,204
Can you not look at me like that?

1470
01:43:50,404 --> 01:43:52,892
I'm trying to find
the right thing to say.

1471
01:43:56,835 --> 01:43:59,136
I think if the obvious response...

1472
01:43:59,332 --> 01:44:01,818
...doesn't immediately
come to you, we can...

1473
01:44:03,011 --> 01:44:04,473
...just...

1474
01:44:05,859 --> 01:44:07,550
We should just...

1475
01:44:07,747 --> 01:44:09,405
...talk about something else.

1476
01:44:09,604 --> 01:44:13,565
Like, possibly,
what a complete ass I am.

1477
01:44:13,763 --> 01:44:18,464
I do recall you promising me
you wouldn't fall in love with me.

1478
01:44:18,659 --> 01:44:19,935
Must pay better attention.

1479
01:44:20,643 --> 01:44:22,585
I've never met a guy
who talks as much as me.

1480
01:44:23,908 --> 01:44:25,217
But could you just for now...

1481
01:44:25,859 --> 01:44:27,517
...be quiet?

1482
01:44:27,779 --> 01:44:28,707
Please?

1483
01:44:44,803 --> 01:44:47,137
How many of his movies
are on that list of his?

1484
01:44:47,330 --> 01:44:48,892
About 15. I love it.

1485
01:44:49,091 --> 01:44:51,774
I don't know how I've never seen
The Lady Eve before.

1486
01:44:51,971 --> 01:44:53,564
Barbara Stanwyck is dazzling.

1487
01:44:53,764 --> 01:44:56,480
- And she's so sure of herself.
- And sexy.

1488
01:44:56,675 --> 01:44:59,063
Really sexy! You know,
every movie he's told me to see...

1489
01:44:59,267 --> 01:45:01,951
...has this powerhouse woman in it.
- Wonder if he's trying...

1490
01:45:02,147 --> 01:45:06,751
...to tell you something with that.
Okay, sorry about that. Boob graze.

1491
01:45:08,163 --> 01:45:11,229
That was accidental.
Accidental boob graze.

1492
01:45:13,763 --> 01:45:15,421
I'm sorry.

1493
01:45:16,738 --> 01:45:18,943
- Changing subject.
- Okay.

1494
01:45:19,139 --> 01:45:21,594
Arthur has requested...

1495
01:45:21,795 --> 01:45:24,730
...that you write some lyrics
for his theme song.

1496
01:45:24,931 --> 01:45:26,589
What's the matter? Who is it?

1497
01:45:26,786 --> 01:45:27,735
It's Maggie.

1498
01:45:29,795 --> 01:45:30,972
Hello?

1499
01:45:32,707 --> 01:45:34,234
Hi.

1500
01:45:35,843 --> 01:45:37,851
I'm doing okay.

1501
01:45:39,939 --> 01:45:43,714
Actually, Maggie,
I'm a bit tied up at the moment.

1502
01:45:44,899 --> 01:45:46,906
I don't know.
What time could you be there?

1503
01:45:49,444 --> 01:45:51,232
All right, I'll be there.

1504
01:45:51,427 --> 01:45:53,631
Oh, no, no. Like, a half-hour.

1505
01:45:54,531 --> 01:45:56,505
Maybe a little longer.

1506
01:45:57,475 --> 01:45:59,482
Okay, bye.

1507
01:46:03,362 --> 01:46:04,923
She misses me.

1508
01:46:05,122 --> 01:46:08,734
You see? She came to her senses.

1509
01:46:13,091 --> 01:46:14,618
- We should get the bill.
- No!

1510
01:46:14,818 --> 01:46:17,152
No, no, take your time.
I can wait till you're finished.

1511
01:46:17,346 --> 01:46:18,273
- I'm finished.
- No.

1512
01:46:18,465 --> 01:46:22,045
- You didn't get to your spicy tuna yet.
- I'm fine, really.

1513
01:46:22,851 --> 01:46:25,273
You can go. I can get this one.

1514
01:46:25,762 --> 01:46:29,177
I'll see you later at the Writers Guild.
I mean, if you can still make it.

1515
01:46:29,378 --> 01:46:32,639
I gotta get all the way to Silver Lake,
but I'm gonna try to be there.

1516
01:46:33,603 --> 01:46:36,385
Anyway, I'm bringing the music.
I mean, I really wanna be there...

1517
01:46:36,579 --> 01:46:38,750
...but I don't know how long
this is gonna take.

1518
01:46:38,947 --> 01:46:40,256
I'm sorry.

1519
01:46:41,730 --> 01:46:43,902
It's all good. Don't worry.

1520
01:46:47,617 --> 01:46:49,691
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

1521
01:47:39,043 --> 01:47:40,287
Hello.

1522
01:47:41,538 --> 01:47:45,367
Oh, Jasper! I'm just reading
your pages.

1523
01:47:45,985 --> 01:47:49,696
No, I hadrt forgotten.
I've just been busy, that's all.

1524
01:47:50,275 --> 01:47:53,657
That's not true. I was gonna call you
when I'd read...

1525
01:47:54,050 --> 01:47:55,611
What kind of surprise?

1526
01:47:55,810 --> 01:47:57,272
No, I don't see a box or anything.

1527
01:47:57,474 --> 01:47:59,384
Yes, I'm sure.

1528
01:47:59,586 --> 01:48:02,171
Hold on, let me just check
the kitchen.

1529
01:48:04,994 --> 01:48:06,488
No, not in there.

1530
01:48:06,690 --> 01:48:08,184
Well, I'll go and check the gate.

1531
01:48:08,386 --> 01:48:11,899
Yes. Well, when did you send it?

1532
01:48:15,234 --> 01:48:17,338
I found your Christmas present.

1533
01:48:26,690 --> 01:48:27,803
This place suits you.

1534
01:48:28,417 --> 01:48:29,694
Yeah, right.

1535
01:48:30,785 --> 01:48:32,541
No, really.

1536
01:48:37,762 --> 01:48:40,576
So you are eventually
gonna look at me, aren't you?

1537
01:48:46,657 --> 01:48:47,901
Hello.

1538
01:48:50,498 --> 01:48:53,564
I came here
because I had to see you.

1539
01:48:53,762 --> 01:48:55,388
Had to.

1540
01:48:56,898 --> 01:48:59,996
Oh, Jasper, I really don't
understand this.

1541
01:49:00,193 --> 01:49:01,719
I mean...

1542
01:49:01,921 --> 01:49:05,980
I was right there for three years!
Remember? Square peg, round hole?

1543
01:49:06,882 --> 01:49:08,092
- What?
- That's what you said.

1544
01:49:08,289 --> 01:49:10,199
That we werert really right
for each other.

1545
01:49:10,402 --> 01:49:12,857
We were a square peg
and a round hole.

1546
01:49:13,058 --> 01:49:15,676
I don't remember that. I just know
I hated when you were gone.

1547
01:49:15,873 --> 01:49:18,262
And also, I have never checked
my e-mails more.

1548
01:49:18,465 --> 01:49:21,401
It was driving me crazy
that I wasrt hearing from you.

1549
01:49:22,402 --> 01:49:24,541
I don't want to lose you, babe.

1550
01:49:27,393 --> 01:49:28,539
Lose me?

1551
01:49:31,106 --> 01:49:33,823
This is too confusing.

1552
01:49:36,706 --> 01:49:38,167
Come here.

1553
01:49:40,961 --> 01:49:44,223
I screwed up.
Miles, haven't you ever screwed up?

1554
01:49:44,417 --> 01:49:46,555
I made a mistake.

1555
01:49:47,488 --> 01:49:49,791
I was stupid and impulsive.

1556
01:49:49,986 --> 01:49:53,117
He wasrt what I thought.
I just started thinking about you...

1557
01:49:53,313 --> 01:49:56,248
...and wishing and hoping
that you would just forgive me.

1558
01:49:56,930 --> 01:49:59,002
Will you, Miles?

1559
01:49:59,265 --> 01:50:01,120
Will you forgive me?

1560
01:50:15,329 --> 01:50:17,303
You know what I was thinking?

1561
01:50:17,504 --> 01:50:18,750
When you get back to London...

1562
01:50:18,946 --> 01:50:21,629
...maybe we could sneak off
somewhere together.

1563
01:50:21,825 --> 01:50:23,516
Maybe Venice.

1564
01:50:23,713 --> 01:50:25,240
You and me in Venice
could be good.

1565
01:50:27,169 --> 01:50:29,406
Do you mean that? I mean...

1566
01:50:30,017 --> 01:50:31,872
Are you free to do that?

1567
01:50:33,056 --> 01:50:34,464
Darling...

1568
01:50:34,658 --> 01:50:38,432
...I 've just traveled halfway across
the world to see you, haven't I?

1569
01:50:43,841 --> 01:50:47,736
Yeah, that doesn't exactly
answer my question, so...

1570
01:50:47,937 --> 01:50:51,899
Are you not with
Sarah anymore? I mean...

1571
01:50:52,098 --> 01:50:54,334
...is that what you've come here
to tell me?

1572
01:50:55,393 --> 01:50:58,971
I wish you could just accept knowing
how confused I am about all this.

1573
01:51:00,960 --> 01:51:03,776
Okay, let me translate that.

1574
01:51:03,970 --> 01:51:07,265
So you are still engaged
to be married.

1575
01:51:09,344 --> 01:51:13,022
- Yes, but, I mean...
- Oh, my God.

1576
01:51:14,817 --> 01:51:17,021
Okay, this was a really...

1577
01:51:17,216 --> 01:51:18,263
...close call.

1578
01:51:18,465 --> 01:51:20,887
You know, I never thought
I'd say this, literally never...

1579
01:51:21,090 --> 01:51:24,024
...but I think you were
absolutely right about us.

1580
01:51:24,225 --> 01:51:26,265
Very square peg, very round hole!

1581
01:51:26,464 --> 01:51:30,108
- You cannot mean that.
- The great thing is I actually do.

1582
01:51:30,305 --> 01:51:32,508
And I'm about three years late
in telling you this...

1583
01:51:32,705 --> 01:51:35,324
...but nevertheless I need to say it.

1584
01:51:35,681 --> 01:51:37,175
Jasper...

1585
01:51:37,376 --> 01:51:38,521
Wait. I need the lights on.

1586
01:51:42,817 --> 01:51:43,766
Jasper...

1587
01:51:46,752 --> 01:51:48,214
...you have never treated me right.

1588
01:51:48,416 --> 01:51:49,879
- Ever.
- Oh, babe.

1589
01:51:51,329 --> 01:51:53,718
You broke my heart.

1590
01:51:53,921 --> 01:51:56,190
And you acted like
somehow it was my fault...

1591
01:51:56,385 --> 01:51:59,199
...my misunderstanding,
and I was too in love with you...

1592
01:51:59,393 --> 01:52:03,070
...to ever be mad at you, so I just
punished myself! For years!

1593
01:52:03,650 --> 01:52:07,065
But you waltzing in here
on my lovely Christmas holiday...

1594
01:52:07,265 --> 01:52:09,404
...and telling me that
you don't want to lose me...

1595
01:52:09,601 --> 01:52:11,903
...whilst you're
about to get married...

1596
01:52:12,096 --> 01:52:14,682
...somehow newly entitles me
to say...

1597
01:52:16,735 --> 01:52:17,663
...it's over.

1598
01:52:18,433 --> 01:52:23,616
This... This twisted,
toxic thing between us...

1599
01:52:23,809 --> 01:52:25,849
...is finally finished!

1600
01:52:26,049 --> 01:52:29,693
I'm miraculously done
being in love with you!

1601
01:52:30,625 --> 01:52:32,992
I've got a life to start living.

1602
01:52:34,593 --> 01:52:37,081
- And you're not going to be in it.
- Darling...

1603
01:52:37,281 --> 01:52:39,452
Now I've got somewhere
really important to be...

1604
01:52:39,649 --> 01:52:42,463
...and you have
got to get the hell out.

1605
01:52:42,976 --> 01:52:45,246
- Now!
- What exactly has got into you?

1606
01:52:46,112 --> 01:52:47,541
I don't know.

1607
01:52:47,745 --> 01:52:51,357
But I think what I've got
is something slightly resembling...

1608
01:52:51,552 --> 01:52:52,862
...gumption.

1609
01:53:16,831 --> 01:53:18,490
Iris...

1610
01:53:18,817 --> 01:53:20,889
...you're a knockout.

1611
01:53:21,185 --> 01:53:22,428
Thank you.

1612
01:53:22,624 --> 01:53:26,334
- And may I say, so are you.
- Did I do my tie okay?

1613
01:53:26,528 --> 01:53:29,495
I haven't worn one in 15 years.

1614
01:53:30,848 --> 01:53:33,784
- It's perfect.
- I like this Hugo Boss.

1615
01:53:33,985 --> 01:53:35,392
He cuts a nice suit.

1616
01:53:36,384 --> 01:53:38,391
I've got something for you.

1617
01:53:45,983 --> 01:53:50,208
Forgive me. The last time
I had a date, this is what we did.

1618
01:53:50,913 --> 01:53:52,538
It's beautiful.

1619
01:53:54,016 --> 01:53:57,212
If it's corny, or if it's
going to ruin your outfit...

1620
01:53:57,408 --> 01:53:59,612
...you don't have to wear it.

1621
01:54:00,608 --> 01:54:02,680
I like corny.

1622
01:54:03,199 --> 01:54:05,174
I'm looking for corny in my life.

1623
01:54:06,080 --> 01:54:09,626
- That's a nice line.
- It's all those movies!

1624
01:54:09,824 --> 01:54:12,245
Okay, let's do it.

1625
01:54:12,447 --> 01:54:14,488
Let's get this embarrassment
over with.

1626
01:54:14,688 --> 01:54:16,510
Okay.

1627
01:54:23,712 --> 01:54:25,816
- Mr. Abbott?
- Yes, sir.

1628
01:54:26,016 --> 01:54:28,089
We're all ready for you.

1629
01:54:40,608 --> 01:54:44,405
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. Arthur Abbott!

1630
01:55:06,208 --> 01:55:09,077
- Oh, hi!
- Arthur, you made it.

1631
01:55:10,175 --> 01:55:11,517
Thank you. Thank you too.

1632
01:55:15,775 --> 01:55:16,724
Thank you very much.

1633
01:55:21,216 --> 01:55:23,190
I'll take you up, Mr. Abbott.

1634
01:55:24,576 --> 01:55:26,681
Go on, go for it.

1635
01:55:43,263 --> 01:55:44,191
I'll do it.

1636
01:55:55,935 --> 01:55:57,560
The man is a rock star.

1637
01:55:58,399 --> 01:55:59,479
Hi!

1638
01:56:02,815 --> 01:56:05,685
Sorry I'm late. The Maggie thing
took a little time, but it is over.

1639
01:56:05,887 --> 01:56:07,643
Finished, kaput.

1640
01:56:09,663 --> 01:56:10,678
You look beautiful.

1641
01:56:12,319 --> 01:56:13,529
Thank you.

1642
01:56:13,727 --> 01:56:15,101
Thanks.

1643
01:56:15,295 --> 01:56:16,986
Thank you, thank you.

1644
01:56:17,183 --> 01:56:18,460
I'm...

1645
01:56:18,656 --> 01:56:21,885
I'm absolutely overwhelmed...

1646
01:56:22,784 --> 01:56:24,245
...that I could climb those stairs.

1647
01:56:25,599 --> 01:56:26,527
He did great.

1648
01:56:27,263 --> 01:56:30,492
I came to Hollywood
over 60 years ago...

1649
01:56:30,687 --> 01:56:33,207
...and immediately fell in love
with motion pictures.

1650
01:56:33,792 --> 01:56:37,403
And it's a love affair
that's lasted a lifetime.

1651
01:56:37,600 --> 01:56:40,415
When I first arrived in Tinseltown...

1652
01:56:40,607 --> 01:56:44,152
...there were no cineplexes
or multiplexes.

1653
01:56:44,351 --> 01:56:48,312
No such thing as a
Blockbuster or DVD.

1654
01:56:48,512 --> 01:56:51,741
I was here before conglomerates
owned the studios.

1655
01:56:52,415 --> 01:56:55,764
Before pictures
had special effects teams.

1656
01:56:55,967 --> 01:56:59,415
And definitely before box office
results were reported...

1657
01:56:59,615 --> 01:57:02,779
...like baseball scores
on the nightly news.

1658
01:57:03,199 --> 01:57:06,046
He is so fantastic.

1659
01:57:06,591 --> 01:57:09,308
- Iris?
- Yes?

1660
01:57:09,503 --> 01:57:11,892
What are you doing
New Year's Eve?

1661
01:57:13,278 --> 01:57:15,100
I'll be back in England
by New Year's Eve.

1662
01:57:18,656 --> 01:57:21,022
You know, I've never been
to England.

1663
01:57:21,504 --> 01:57:24,504
- I've never been to Europe.
- No?

1664
01:57:24,991 --> 01:57:27,806
If I come over there, will you go out
with me on New Year's Eve?

1665
01:57:32,351 --> 01:57:33,661
Love to.

1666
01:57:53,919 --> 01:57:56,766
We're not gonna make a bigger deal
out of this than it already is.

1667
01:57:56,959 --> 01:57:58,268
No, we're not.

1668
01:57:58,462 --> 01:58:00,829
It's not like we're never
going to speak or e-mail or...

1669
01:58:01,022 --> 01:58:03,805
- No set rules.
- None.

1670
01:58:05,023 --> 01:58:08,154
So now I'm just gonna
kiss you for the millionth time...

1671
01:58:08,350 --> 01:58:09,725
...and say, "Be seeing you."

1672
01:58:25,086 --> 01:58:26,909
Be seeing you.

1673
01:58:31,678 --> 01:58:33,567
Take care of yourself.

1674
01:59:32,894 --> 01:59:34,749
Did you have a good holiday, miss?

1675
01:59:35,551 --> 01:59:37,045
Yeah.

1676
01:59:37,694 --> 01:59:39,068
Great.

1677
01:59:41,726 --> 01:59:43,831
Maybe the best ever.

1678
02:00:36,159 --> 02:00:37,980
Amanda Woods...

1679
02:00:38,174 --> 02:00:39,734
...welcome back.

1680
02:00:41,822 --> 02:00:43,480
Turn around!

1681
02:00:44,062 --> 02:00:45,785
Turn around and go back, please!

1682
02:00:45,982 --> 02:00:49,397
- Did you forget something?
- Yes! Yes.

1683
02:01:00,126 --> 02:01:01,304
Can you go any faster?

1684
02:01:01,501 --> 02:01:03,290
This lane's tricky.
It's gonna take a bit.

1685
02:01:03,486 --> 02:01:04,697
It's okay, just stop.

1686
02:01:11,005 --> 02:01:12,020
Madam?

1687
02:01:13,021 --> 02:01:14,451
Madam!

1688
02:02:07,453 --> 02:02:08,915
Graham?

1689
02:02:10,045 --> 02:02:11,704
Graham.

1690
02:02:23,646 --> 02:02:25,172
You know...

1691
02:02:25,373 --> 02:02:27,576
...I was just thinking...

1692
02:02:28,702 --> 02:02:30,970
...why would I ever leave
before New Year's Eve?

1693
02:02:31,581 --> 02:02:33,971
That makes no sense at all.

1694
02:02:34,173 --> 02:02:36,759
I mean, you didn't exactly
ask me out...

1695
02:02:38,846 --> 02:02:41,213
...but you did say you loved me...

1696
02:02:41,534 --> 02:02:44,086
...so I'm thinking I've got a date.

1697
02:02:44,605 --> 02:02:45,685
If you'll have me.

1698
02:02:48,254 --> 02:02:50,108
I have the girls New Year's Eve.

1699
02:02:52,990 --> 02:02:54,102
Sounds perfect.

1700
02:03:12,798 --> 02:03:14,707
I'm coming to get you!

1701
02:03:14,909 --> 02:03:19,099
You look just like an angel
on the top of the Christmas tree.

1702
02:03:19,293 --> 02:03:21,660
You got so big. Give us a kiss.

1703
02:03:22,110 --> 02:03:24,827
Come and tell me all about
your Christmas presents.

1704
02:03:25,342 --> 02:03:26,585
Go sit with Miles.

1705
02:03:35,965 --> 02:03:36,892
Sweetie.

1706
02:04:12,221 --> 02:04:15,035
- I challenge ye.
- Me?

1707
02:04:34,845 --> 02:04:36,884
The love train
is leaving the station.

1708
02:04:51,004 --> 02:04:53,110
- Happy New Year!
- Happy New Year!

1709
02:04:53,309 --> 02:04:55,251
Happy New Year!

1710
02:04:55,453 --> 02:04:59,249
Happy New Year, everybody!

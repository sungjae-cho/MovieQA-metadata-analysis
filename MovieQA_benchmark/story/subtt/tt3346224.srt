1
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,289
<i>Federal prosecutor Sam Ellis is
widely expected to run for higher office.</i>

2
00:00:46,359 --> 00:00:49,569
<i>Those hopes could be dashed if the jury
returns with e "not guilty" verdict.</i>

3
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:52,290
<i>A resolution is expected
shortly on federal charges.</i>

4
00:00:52,359 --> 00:00:55,363
<i>With rumors circulating that
Ellis plans to seek higher office.</i>

5
00:00:55,439 --> 00:00:57,601
<i>Everything is
riding on today's decision.</i>

6
00:00:57,679 --> 00:01:00,490
<i>Today's decision will either
launch his political career..</i>

7
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:03,165
<i>Presumably beginning
with e run for attorney general.</i>

8
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,650
Mr. Ellis?

9
00:01:04,719 --> 00:01:07,484
Yeah.

10
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,960
A couple of us arranged
this little drinks thing at Blend.

11
00:01:10,039 --> 00:01:12,724
We're kind of all assuming
that you'll be there.

12
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:15,644
Don't we have to win first?

13
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:17,807
There's no way you'll lose.

14
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,004
All rise.

15
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:30,561
<i>Do you think Sheriff
Haussler should be given</i>

16
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,881
a lesser sentence given
his record of public service?

17
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,850
As I said in the trial, Jim, this is a
black-and-white issue legally and morally.

18
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,649
There should be no special treatment.

19
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:41,883
After today's victory, do you
intend to pursue corruption charges

20
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:44,326
against other officials
in the mayor's administration?

21
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,879
No decisions on any further action
have been made at this time.

22
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,240
Any chance you're gonna run
for attorney general, Sam?

23
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:51,760
<i>I have my hands full
at the U.S. Attorney's office right now.</i>

24
00:01:51,879 --> 00:01:54,884
<i>While Haussler is expected to appeal
today's decision, all eyes will be on</i>

25
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,567
<i>whether the U.S. Attorney's office plans to
seek charges against Mayor Jonas Stiegel.</i>

26
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,209
So, straight on to attorney general?

27
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,805
I can neither confirm
nor deny, counselor.

28
00:02:05,879 --> 00:02:07,644
<i>Fucking liar.</i>

29
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,205
You didn't hear Mommy say that.

30
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,930
<i>How's his temperature?</i>

31
00:02:12,159 --> 00:02:13,729
Almost there.

32
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,961
We were watching you on TV.

33
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:16,450
<i>Yeah? Did I look nervous?</i>

34
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,567
<i>I felt like I was shaking.</i>

35
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:18,526
You looked hot.

36
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:21,688
Women on the jury really
loved your lady justice thing.

37
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:22,966
<i>Uh-huh. It's you they liked.</i>

38
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:25,201
Well, they did throw
their undergarments at me.

39
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,442
<i>Is that unusual?
Whores.</i>

40
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,443
My dad was watching
with George Hiller.

41
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,602
<i>They think we should get
Nigel Coaker to write you up</i>

42
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,522
<i>in his "Faces to Watch" piece.</i>

43
00:02:33,639 --> 00:02:34,687
Yeah, that'd be amazing.

44
00:02:34,759 --> 00:02:36,524
I have Nigel's number.
I'll give him a call.

45
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:38,408
<i>He owes my dad
a ton of favors, anyway.</i>

46
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:39,719
<i>What time are you coming home?</i>

47
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,167
You know, they're having
a little victory lap party for us.

48
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,810
I got to put in an appearance.

49
00:02:43,879 --> 00:02:45,006
Lame. I'm kidding.

50
00:02:45,079 --> 00:02:47,002
It's fine.
Proud of you, honey.

51
00:02:47,079 --> 00:02:48,365
Okay, I'm pulling up.
I love you.

52
00:02:48,439 --> 00:02:50,760
Love you.

53
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:55,920
<i>To Sam Ellis.</i>

54
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,449
After 18 months of nonstop toil,
may he enjoy his moment in the sun

55
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:04,443
'cause tomorrow I'm going
to bury him under a pile of work.

56
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,961
To Sam.

57
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,205
To Sam.

58
00:03:14,039 --> 00:03:14,768
Fucking lawyers.

59
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:17,120
Do you guys not get it out
of your systems freshman year?

60
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:19,639
Fuck off.
Fuck off?

61
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:21,728
Okay.

62
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,528
Jeannie must be excited, yeah?

63
00:03:23,639 --> 00:03:25,768
Yeah. Yeah.
She's getting restless, though.

64
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,968
Don't tell me you're not, either.

65
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:30,246
You've done all you can here,

66
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:32,606
especially with that fucking
fossil running the show.

67
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,010
Easy.
All right.

68
00:03:34,079 --> 00:03:35,808
It's...

69
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:37,769
It's time, yeah?

70
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,604
Sam Ellis
for attorney fucking general.

71
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:43,808
Everybody was just waiting
for you to win this fucker.

72
00:03:43,879 --> 00:03:46,485
Put a pin in it for now.

73
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,562
No, no.

74
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:49,925
Don't leave me hanging here.

75
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:51,962
There's got to be more to life
than hedge funds,

76
00:03:52,039 --> 00:03:54,008
or I'm gonna fucking kill myself.

77
00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:55,286
Come on.

78
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:58,085
I do have to go, though.

79
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:00,686
Before the wife throws a fit.
Come on.

80
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,289
Listen, congrats again.

81
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,599
Yeah.
All right.

82
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:05,403
See ya.
See ya.

83
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,884
I'll take another.

84
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:29,928
You did not!

85
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,809
No, I don't believe you.

86
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:45,566
I'm not saying that.
You did a great job.

87
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,807
Then what exactly
are you saying, counselor?

88
00:04:47,879 --> 00:04:50,963
Lam saying that you should
just move around a bit

89
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,201
before the semester's over.

90
00:04:52,279 --> 00:04:54,168
You don't want to go back
to law school thinking

91
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,689
that this whole office
is just one boring section.

92
00:04:58,759 --> 00:05:00,488
What if I like your section?

93
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,687
I still think it's a mistake.

94
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:05,411
I do. You got to figure out
what you believe in,

95
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,528
what makes your righteous.

96
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,648
Angry, even.

97
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,528
And you have this figured out?

98
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,886
Absolutely.

99
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:17,283
Guys that I take down have
no reason to break the law,

100
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,285
yet they're these over privileged,
morally bankrupt individuals

101
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,410
who think they can just stomp
on the weak and the powerless

102
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:28,723
and get away with it
because they usually do.

103
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,279
If I didn't think
they deserved to go down,

104
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,930
couldn't try the case.

105
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,528
Don't quote me on that.

106
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,170
These cigarettes
are going to my head.

107
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,367
You're a lightweight.

108
00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:42,646
Yeah, I don't...

109
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,370
I don't smoke.

110
00:05:45,439 --> 00:05:47,841
Just doing it to impress me?

111
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:51,845
Oh, I gave up trying to impress
girls like you a long time ago.

112
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:58,687
Oh, boy.

113
00:06:22,279 --> 00:06:24,759
Yeah, this...

114
00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:27,644
Can't do precisely that.

115
00:06:28,759 --> 00:06:30,444
Right.

116
00:06:30,519 --> 00:06:32,124
I'm sorry.

117
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,442
Yeah.
You're married.

118
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:46,242
You know,
I can keep a secret, though.

119
00:06:48,279 --> 00:06:51,283
I'm sure you can.

120
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,567
I just can't be one of them.

121
00:06:54,519 --> 00:06:56,009
<i>Hmm.</i>

122
00:06:56,079 --> 00:06:57,649
Goodnight, kiddo.

123
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,369
I love you, Ellis.

124
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,205
I love you, too.

125
00:08:59,159 --> 00:09:00,279
If you want to move on this,

126
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,606
you better be staying here
long enough to see it through,

127
00:09:02,679 --> 00:09:04,125
'cause I'm not getting burned on it.

128
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,530
Guy's committed actual crimes.

129
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,490
If human frailty's all we got,
it'll look like a moral crusade.

130
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:09,129
Then let it go.

131
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,567
It's not my job
to help you chase headlines.

132
00:09:11,639 --> 00:09:14,245
Do you want the mayor
out of office or not?

133
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,730
Yeah.

134
00:09:17,559 --> 00:09:19,129
Hey, how much longer
is Dalia with us?

135
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,246
Eight weeks.

136
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,684
Any chance
we could transfer her?

137
00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:23,649
I'm not telling
the ninth circuit judge

138
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:26,563
I fired his daughter
'cause she's too damn pretty.

139
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:27,801
Huh.

140
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,082
Sam.

141
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,405
This is Ellie Green.

142
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:35,091
Miss Green, this is Sam Ellis,
chief of our criminal division.

143
00:09:35,159 --> 00:09:36,446
Sam Ellis.
Hello.

144
00:09:36,519 --> 00:09:38,442
You've already met U.S.
Attorney Kirkland. Hi.

145
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:39,850
I wanted Sam to review your file.

146
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:42,399
He's tried a lot
of these identity theft cases.

147
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:45,086
Knows how to work a jury
on these kind of issues.

148
00:09:45,159 --> 00:09:47,765
Mm. The right man
for the job, then.

149
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,044
So, what's the concern?

150
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:57,090
Would you prefer to explain?

151
00:09:57,159 --> 00:09:59,765
I have a record as an escort.

152
00:10:01,639 --> 00:10:04,291
How'd you...

153
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,770
How'd you get into that?

154
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:06,761
I was trying to model

155
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:11,288
and I was working
as a waitress at a hotel.

156
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:15,250
I met this guy who suggested
I could make a lot more money

157
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:19,370
just going on a few dates
for an agency.

158
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,090
He was right.

159
00:10:21,159 --> 00:10:22,730
That how you met the defendant?

160
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:24,130
No.

161
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:28,888
Elite Encounters only serviced
very high-end clients,

162
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:32,009
politicians,
prominent businessmen.

163
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:36,482
I saved the lowlifes
for my personal life.

164
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:38,369
Would you say that
your experience makes you

165
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:40,124
an expert in lying?

166
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:44,240
No.

167
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,607
No, it's... it's not about that.

168
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:50,411
It's about fulfilling
people's fantasies

169
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:54,201
while minimizing their guilt.

170
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:55,725
I'd say being a lawyer

171
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:59,730
is probably better training
for lying.

172
00:10:59,799 --> 00:11:01,245
But you do have
a criminal record.

173
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,368
Not for lying.

174
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,965
Would you tell
your parents about it?

175
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:06,451
It's not like
I was a street walker.

176
00:11:06,559 --> 00:11:09,130
You think the jury would
perceive that distinction?

177
00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:11,879
The men will.

178
00:11:17,679 --> 00:11:19,602
Wow. Mm.

179
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,806
Yeah.

180
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,721
I know I should really
push the parent issue.

181
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:25,846
The jury might get past it

182
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:28,206
if they see her
as an abandoned kid up there.

183
00:11:28,279 --> 00:11:30,168
Maybe.

184
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:33,562
Everyone's got a dark side
you don't normally get to see.

185
00:11:33,639 --> 00:11:36,040
I think jurors understand that.

186
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:39,168
I know a lot of guys
who used her agency.

187
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,730
Swore by it.

188
00:11:40,799 --> 00:11:42,563
Shouldn't we be
prosecuting that?

189
00:11:42,679 --> 00:11:45,649
Trafficking, sure,
but we got bigger problems.

190
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,289
You said it yourself, Sam.

191
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:50,364
Nobody cares
about human frailty.

192
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,884
It's still against the law.

193
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,688
Right. Boy Scout.

194
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,770
Say "hi" to the intern for me.

195
00:12:07,879 --> 00:12:10,120
Night, chief.
Have a great weekend.

196
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,565
Take it easy.

197
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,645
Oh.

198
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,605
No.

199
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,808
James asked if
he could have a sibling.

200
00:14:13,879 --> 00:14:14,927
Really?

201
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:16,565
Yeah.

202
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:19,006
That Stiegel?

203
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:21,287
No, I'm just helping
Noah with a case.

204
00:14:25,039 --> 00:14:28,327
You think a jury would discredit
testimony from an escort?

205
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:30,606
I don't know. Depends on
the witness, I guess.

206
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,802
You don't think they'd find it
morally reprehensible?

207
00:14:33,879 --> 00:14:35,847
I think they probably
understand it's not quite

208
00:14:35,919 --> 00:14:37,729
the taboo it used to be.

209
00:14:37,799 --> 00:14:43,841
I mean, you got all those
people watching internet porn.

210
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,048
What's she like?
You meet her?

211
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,360
Is she sexy?

212
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,085
I don't know.

213
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,808
You tired?
Yeah.

214
00:15:08,879 --> 00:15:12,201
I just... I have
to be up early.

215
00:15:12,279 --> 00:15:13,964
Can I get a hug?

216
00:15:15,799 --> 00:15:18,405
I think I can manage that.

217
00:15:31,799 --> 00:15:33,039
James, you ready?

218
00:15:33,159 --> 00:15:34,764
Here, John, I got that.
I got it.

219
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:36,688
Okay.
Don't worry.

220
00:15:36,759 --> 00:15:38,091
Not joining us, huh, Sam?

221
00:15:38,159 --> 00:15:39,161
No.

222
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:41,048
Sure you can survive
a whole weekend

223
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,167
without my daughter?

224
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,288
I'll have to try, sir.

225
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,088
Don't really have
your sea legs, anyway.

226
00:15:46,159 --> 00:15:47,730
That is true.

227
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:51,003
Remind me next time.
I got some pills for that.

228
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,844
You taking the new one?

229
00:15:52,919 --> 00:15:54,570
You bet.

230
00:15:54,679 --> 00:15:57,683
130-footer.

231
00:15:57,759 --> 00:15:58,760
Wow.

232
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,284
Stiegel keeping you on land?

233
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,282
Yeah, mostly.

234
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,489
Guess you pretty much
dug yourself into that hole.

235
00:16:04,559 --> 00:16:06,721
What's your plans if you lose?

236
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:08,722
Doing my best not to lose.

237
00:16:08,799 --> 00:16:09,846
Well,

238
00:16:09,919 --> 00:16:12,764
try not to burn the house down
while we're away, huh?

239
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,807
Will do.

240
00:16:14,879 --> 00:16:16,609
Hey, Jimmy-

241
00:16:16,679 --> 00:16:20,126
Have fun, pal. Ready to
go sailing with Grandpa?

242
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,086
How bad was he?

243
00:16:21,159 --> 00:16:23,128
The usual.
Do you have to go?

244
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,850
I'm going to be so bored
without you guys.

245
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:27,121
You're so sweet.

246
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:29,201
It's only a couple of days.
Be back Sunday night.

247
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:30,121
Okay.

248
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,803
And...

249
00:16:31,879 --> 00:16:36,124
if you get lonely, you can
always call that witness.

250
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:40,000
I love you.

251
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,006
"Money exchanged

252
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:25,122
is intended for companionship
and modeling services only."

253
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:18,086
Can I get a pre-paid phone there?

254
00:18:42,839 --> 00:18:45,605
<i>Executive privilege.</i>

255
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:47,603
Hi, yes.

256
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:50,523
I was looking on your site and

257
00:18:50,599 --> 00:18:53,250
I'm just wondering how I could

258
00:18:53,359 --> 00:18:55,521
make an appointment
with Christy.

259
00:18:55,599 --> 00:18:57,089
<i>Christy, yeah.
Great girl.</i>

260
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,809
<i>She's one of our favorites.</i>

261
00:18:58,880 --> 00:18:59,880
<i>My name's Mona.</i>

262
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:03,366
<i>I just need to ask you
a few questions.</i>

263
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:04,321
What...

264
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,845
What questions?

265
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:07,040
<i>Well, what's your name?</i>

266
00:19:07,119 --> 00:19:08,565
Oh, yeah. Okay.

267
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:12,326
My name is Bob Fisher.

268
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:15,164
<i>And what do you do, Bob?</i>

269
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:17,367
I'm a... I'm a lawyer.

270
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,964
<i>Okay, Bob, is there something</i>

271
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:21,441
<i>that you can
tell me about yourself</i>

272
00:19:21,519 --> 00:19:22,851
<i>that I could
share with Christy?</i>

273
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:23,921
<i>Oh, I don't know.</i>

274
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,923
<i>I'm Caucasian.</i>

275
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,888
<i>Six feet, 190.</i>

276
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:29,961
<i>Pretty good shape.</i>

277
00:19:30,039 --> 00:19:32,645
<i>What are some ofyour hobbies?
What do you like to do, Bob?</i>

278
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,289
Not much of a movie guy.

279
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,003
I...

280
00:19:36,079 --> 00:19:39,049
read a lot. I like the crime novels.

281
00:19:39,119 --> 00:19:41,726
<i>Well, I'm sure Christy
will like to dress for you.</i>

282
00:19:41,799 --> 00:19:43,211
<i>Do you have any preferences?</i>

283
00:19:44,599 --> 00:19:48,605
Maybe like... like a tight sweater.

284
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:49,681
I don't know.

285
00:19:49,759 --> 00:19:53,401
<i>You know what you like, yes?</i>

286
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:54,366
<i>Yeah.</i>

287
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:57,171
<i>Have you ever
used an agency before?</i>

288
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,401
No.

289
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,685
No. First time.

290
00:19:59,799 --> 00:20:03,201
<i>Okay, perfect.
My favorite kind of client.</i>

291
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,689
<i>So, once you get there,</i>

292
00:20:06,759 --> 00:20:10,809
<i>you'll leave your money
in an envelope on the counter.</i>

293
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:13,611
<i>And once we know that
everybody's fine, safe, happy,</i>

294
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:16,968
<i>and comfortable,
then we'll start the hour.</i>

295
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:20,044
<i>And if you're not happy,
all you have to do is call,</i>

296
00:20:20,119 --> 00:20:22,487
<i>and we'll make sure
we'll make you happy.</i>

297
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:24,642
<i>We have plenty of girls.</i>

298
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,608
<i>She'll be at the Stan wick Hotel.</i>

299
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:28,761
<i>Have you been there before?</i>

300
00:20:28,839 --> 00:20:30,842
Stanwick, yeah. Yes.
I know where that is.

301
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:33,570
<i>Room 209.
209.</i>

302
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:36,165
<i>Yeah, and if anything
comes up, Bob, give me a call,</i>

303
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:39,482
<i>and I'll do the same for you.
Okay.</i>

304
00:20:39,559 --> 00:20:41,449
I'll be on time.

305
00:20:41,519 --> 00:20:43,045
<i>Thank you, Bob.</i>

306
00:20:43,119 --> 00:20:44,405
Thank you.

307
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,564
Shit.

308
00:21:24,039 --> 00:21:25,326
What floor you heading to?

309
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,686
Two, please.
Thank you.

310
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:27,563
Hi there.
Hi.

311
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:29,688
So, you must be...

312
00:22:29,759 --> 00:22:31,171
Christy.
Christy.

313
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:33,527
Your hair looks different.

314
00:22:33,599 --> 00:22:35,284
Oh, I love this suit.

315
00:22:35,359 --> 00:22:37,282
Oh, thank you.
Don't tell me.

316
00:22:37,359 --> 00:22:39,009
It's Canali?

317
00:22:39,079 --> 00:22:41,082
Wow, that's impressive.

318
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:44,287
Uh, I have the, uh...

319
00:22:44,359 --> 00:22:46,839
Oh, you can just leave
the donation on the counter.

320
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:48,205
Right.

321
00:22:55,839 --> 00:22:57,410
So, yeah.

322
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,961
First time, maybe?

323
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:03,122
Might be.

324
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:08,126
Well, I am flattered
you chose me, then.

325
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,241
I can already tell
you're my kind of guy.

326
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,770
Sorry, I'm...

327
00:23:17,839 --> 00:23:19,204
I don't know how this works.

328
00:23:21,559 --> 00:23:23,528
Bob, do you like scotch?

329
00:23:23,599 --> 00:23:24,487
Sure, yeah.

330
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:27,086
Why don't I fix you a drink?

331
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,763
Yeah.
Okay.

332
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:33,891
Make yourself comfortable.

333
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:39,851
Thank you.
Yeah.

334
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,125
That's good.

335
00:23:55,119 --> 00:23:57,122
Cheers.
Cheers.

336
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:05,769
I seriously love this fabric.

337
00:24:06,599 --> 00:24:07,931
You have really good taste.

338
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,684
Thank you. Yeah.

339
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:13,279
Worked at a clothing store
in college.

340
00:24:13,359 --> 00:24:15,442
Wound up spending most
of my paycheck on clothes.

341
00:24:15,519 --> 00:24:17,442
And now I sound like a girl.

342
00:24:17,519 --> 00:24:18,681
No.

343
00:24:18,759 --> 00:24:20,728
No, even men need
to be pampered.

344
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:22,483
Yeah.

345
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:24,721
I...

346
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:27,804
I used to work
as a massage therapist.

347
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:30,565
So...

348
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:34,008
I know how important it is
to have someone around

349
00:24:34,079 --> 00:24:36,048
to take care of your needs.

350
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:16,487
You must have
a really stressful job.

351
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:17,560
Yeah.

352
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:20,246
I can feel it
in your shoulders.

353
00:25:27,799 --> 00:25:30,371
You want to take
a shower with me?

354
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:37,083
I'll do it myself.

355
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,402
You want to come join me?

356
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:15,883
I can't do this.

357
00:26:18,519 --> 00:26:19,520
I'm sorry.

358
00:26:19,599 --> 00:26:21,089
It's my mistake.

359
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:25,449
Well, there's no need to rush.

360
00:26:25,559 --> 00:26:26,606
We can just talk.

361
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:29,160
Thank you,
but I... I... I have to go.

362
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,730
I'm... I'm sorry.

363
00:26:33,519 --> 00:26:35,442
Let me help you.

364
00:26:35,519 --> 00:26:36,884
Thank you.

365
00:26:40,519 --> 00:26:42,682
You married?

366
00:26:42,759 --> 00:26:44,000
Yeah.

367
00:26:44,119 --> 00:26:45,530
13 Years.

368
00:26:45,599 --> 00:26:47,328
13 years.

369
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:48,845
Yeah.

370
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,246
How old are you?

371
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,444
We were married young.

372
00:26:56,279 --> 00:26:58,044
I see.

373
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
What?

374
00:27:00,039 --> 00:27:03,521
Well, I can understand
why you're here.

375
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:07,361
It must be hard giving
your youth away to one person.

376
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:15,722
It's a lot of things.

377
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:21,847
She cheated on me
back in school.

378
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:24,445
I thought...

379
00:27:24,519 --> 00:27:27,443
You know, it's before
we were married, but I...

380
00:27:30,039 --> 00:27:32,247
Are there things she won't do?

381
00:27:33,519 --> 00:27:35,921
Things you want to try?

382
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,729
Yeah, sure.

383
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,681
I like to try things.

384
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,163
Is that okay?

385
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:55,369
Oh, god.

386
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,808
How are you doing?

387
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,211
I'm good.

388
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:14,605
You want to fuck me now?

389
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:16,125
Yeah.

390
00:30:05,079 --> 00:30:06,490
Fuck!

391
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:17,723
So, any plans
for the rest of the day?

392
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:19,925
Sorry.

393
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,366
You don't have to answer that.

394
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:23,805
No. I...

395
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,606
I have no more appointments
if that's what you're asking.

396
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,926
I might go lingerie shopping.

397
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:37,326
Hey, do you always
kiss on the lips?

398
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:40,210
I thought that wasn't part of it.

399
00:30:40,279 --> 00:30:41,849
You're sweet.

400
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,964
Well, Christy...

401
00:30:46,039 --> 00:30:47,451
it was nice to meet you.

402
00:30:47,519 --> 00:30:49,284
You know, you should
make an appointment

403
00:30:49,359 --> 00:30:51,282
with my friend Clio.

404
00:30:51,359 --> 00:30:53,249
She's the top girl
at the agency.

405
00:30:53,319 --> 00:30:55,003
She only sees referrals.

406
00:30:55,119 --> 00:30:58,202
Maybe the three of us
could have some fun together.

407
00:30:58,279 --> 00:31:01,682
Sorry, but this was
a one time thing.

408
00:31:01,759 --> 00:31:03,000
Well, I'll tell her about you

409
00:31:03,079 --> 00:31:05,559
in case you change your mind.

410
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:08,564
Trust me,
you'll definitely like her.

411
00:31:11,319 --> 00:31:12,320
Thank you.

412
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,490
Thank you.
Sure.

413
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,923
<i>Dag“
Hey.</i>

414
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,765
Wha... what are you doing home?

415
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,404
We got back early.

416
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:09,084
Thought we'd surprise you.

417
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:10,082
Where you been?

418
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:13,767
We had a meeting with some
of the agents on Stiegel.

419
00:32:13,839 --> 00:32:15,410
A weekend?
That's a drag.

420
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:17,323
Yeah.
Your hair's wet.

421
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:18,287
You been to the gym?

422
00:32:18,359 --> 00:32:19,724
Yeah, stopped
on my way back.

423
00:32:19,799 --> 00:32:21,039
Good for you.

424
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:24,280
Want to come eat?

425
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:26,681
Yeah. Smells amazing.

426
00:33:33,839 --> 00:33:36,080
<i>With more than
800, 000 federal workers</i>

427
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:37,849
<i>standing to lose their paychecks...</i>

428
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:40,207
You nervous?

429
00:33:40,279 --> 00:33:44,204
I'm just wondering
if it's the smart move

430
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:45,684
to do this right now.

431
00:33:45,799 --> 00:33:47,450
He knows I can't talk about Stiegel.

432
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:49,647
Nigel Coaker's on "Meet the
Press" every other week.

433
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:52,086
He's barely gonna
know who Stiegel is.

434
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:56,080
Which one?

435
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:57,365
Your call.

436
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,724
You know, don't over think it.

437
00:33:59,799 --> 00:34:01,403
Just relax.

438
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,721
Let him see the man underneath.

439
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:09,849
<i>Many estimates suggest e
shutdown could cost the government.</i>

440
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:13,128
Nice. Just a few more.

441
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:14,405
Good.

442
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:18,802
So, Sam, your mother,

443
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:21,166
you've cited her as being
a source of inspiration.

444
00:34:21,239 --> 00:34:23,402
Was arrested
on a number of occasions

445
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:25,487
in protests during the '70s.

446
00:34:25,559 --> 00:34:29,644
What does she think about you
becoming a federal prosecutor?

447
00:34:29,719 --> 00:34:33,202
Well, she passed away
before I got the job, but...

448
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,610
I hope she'd be proud of me.

449
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:36,802
Would she have
supported your prosecution

450
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:41,168
of medical marijuana
facilities, for example?

451
00:34:41,239 --> 00:34:43,242
Well, Nigel, my mother
taught me from an early age

452
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:46,324
to fight for justice, protect
those who are vulnerable.

453
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,969
The law's
the best way to do that.

454
00:34:48,039 --> 00:34:50,440
The U.S. Attorney's office
prosecutes those who break it.

455
00:34:50,519 --> 00:34:51,931
We don't decide
what the laws are.

456
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,242
No, but you pick
the cases you pursue.

457
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:58,443
So, that means
there is a moral intent.

458
00:34:58,519 --> 00:35:03,400
Now, if 20 states have
a medical exemption for it,

459
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:06,164
how can the issue
be black-and-white?

460
00:35:06,239 --> 00:35:07,286
Because it is.

461
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:09,760
Nigel, I want to thank you
for including me in your piece.

462
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:11,682
Oh, anything for Jeannie.

463
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,728
Listen, Sam,
if you're interested,

464
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:15,170
I'd like to talk to the magazine

465
00:35:15,239 --> 00:35:16,889
about doing
a longer profile on you,

466
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,007
something more personal.

467
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:19,525
Maybe I can
trail you in the office.

468
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:22,762
You know, do a "day in
the life" kind of thing.

469
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:24,887
Well, our meetings
are usually confidential,

470
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:27,088
but I'm sure we can
arrange something.

471
00:35:27,159 --> 00:35:28,605
Look, I got to get
James to school.

472
00:35:28,679 --> 00:35:30,762
You got any more questions?
Yes.

473
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:32,648
When are you running?

474
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,603
Mom's gonna pick you up.

475
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:41,201
Your father seems
to think he'll go far

476
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:43,248
if he can handle the pressure.

477
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:45,367
What do you think?

478
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:47,168
I don't think he likes me.

479
00:35:47,239 --> 00:35:49,686
Oh, he's just sensitive
about his mother, that's all.

480
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:51,568
Mm, well, I think he's intimidated

481
00:35:51,639 --> 00:35:54,371
by the size of my reputation.

482
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:56,329
Hmm??

483
00:36:00,199 --> 00:36:01,884
How are you two doing?

484
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:03,449
Great.

485
00:36:03,519 --> 00:36:06,126
Things are a little crazed,
but we're great.

486
00:36:06,199 --> 00:36:08,282
Well, I'm glad to hear it.

487
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:24,362
There's a piece about
the attorney general race

488
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:26,123
on the news right now.
Oh yeah?

489
00:36:26,199 --> 00:36:28,123
I need to watch that.

490
00:36:28,199 --> 00:36:29,405
They mention me?

491
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:31,721
No, they weren't
singling anybody out.

492
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:33,608
You want me to record it?

493
00:36:37,679 --> 00:36:39,045
Sam?

494
00:36:41,639 --> 00:36:43,960
Yeah, that'd be great.
Thanks.

495
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:52,880
Is there a history
of cancer in your family?

496
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:56,329
My mother died
from liver cancer.

497
00:36:56,440 --> 00:37:00,570
But, you know, she was
a heavy smoker and big drinker.

498
00:37:00,639 --> 00:37:04,769
Have you been with any new
sexual partners recently?

499
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:09,684
Well, I'm married.

500
00:37:11,159 --> 00:37:12,923
But yeah.

501
00:37:13,039 --> 00:37:15,724
One other one a few days ago.

502
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,166
It was just one time, though,

503
00:37:18,239 --> 00:37:20,447
and I... I used a condom.

504
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,650
Well, there is a bump,

505
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:26,570
but it's probably
an ingrown hair or something.

506
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:30,010
In all likelihood,
I think you're fine.

507
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:37,809
Ladies and gentlemen,
Senator Edward Pollan.

508
00:37:40,639 --> 00:37:41,766
Thank you, Jeannie.

509
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:45,400
Your exemplary work
with the edible schoolyard project

510
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:48,324
is an inspiration to all of us.

511
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:51,960
You know, I often ask myself
what we can do in Washington

512
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:55,163
to help shape
our children's sense of place.

513
00:37:58,239 --> 00:37:59,969
Sam Ellis.

514
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:03,251
George Hiller.
Yes.

515
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:05,208
Glad to finally
meet you in person.

516
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:06,724
Absolutely, sir.

517
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,130
That country club thing,

518
00:38:08,199 --> 00:38:10,248
that was a heck of a move.

519
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:11,242
Thank you.

520
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:14,608
I understand that you're looking
at attorney general.

521
00:38:14,679 --> 00:38:19,288
[ Well, I'm not looking at any job beyond
my current employment. ]

522
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:21,242
I got something better.

523
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:26,009
What'll you two ladies have?

524
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:27,445
I'll take a champagne, please.

525
00:38:27,519 --> 00:38:29,760
Bourbon and soda for me.
Yes, ma'am.

526
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:31,001
Who are you?

527
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:31,927
Jeannie?

528
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,239
Noah.

529
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:34,481
How's the boss treating you?

530
00:38:34,559 --> 00:38:36,164
Oh, total slave master.

531
00:38:36,239 --> 00:38:37,240
I'll bet.

532
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:41,166
He drag you in for that
FBI meeting last weekend?

533
00:38:41,239 --> 00:38:42,650
No.

534
00:38:42,719 --> 00:38:44,722
Guess it must've been
above my pay grade.

535
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:47,969
Well, don't worry.
You'll make it.

536
00:38:48,039 --> 00:38:49,280
You want a drink?

537
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:50,771
Senator Pollan?

538
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:52,001
You sure?

539
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:54,208
He's gonna give up his seat?

540
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:57,045
I got him to promise
not to go public yet,

541
00:38:57,119 --> 00:38:58,724
but it's done.

542
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:03,601
Now, Pollan says he's
gonna announce in a year.

543
00:39:03,679 --> 00:39:06,364
When he announces,
we pull the trigger.

544
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:09,204
You quit your job
and you jump in the race.

545
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:15,400
But I got to know now whether
you got the balls for this.

546
00:39:16,719 --> 00:39:18,289
I'll have to think it over.

547
00:39:20,039 --> 00:39:21,326
Well, think it over.

548
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:25,291
But remember,
I'm the other woman here,

549
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:27,521
so don't keep me waiting.

550
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:29,284
Now, Nigel Coaker's

551
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:32,010
already agreed
to write the longer article,

552
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:34,481
which will keep things alive.

553
00:39:34,599 --> 00:39:40,050
You just cultivate that clean
image because your mythology

554
00:39:40,199 --> 00:39:42,168
is your best asset.

555
00:39:46,239 --> 00:39:47,239
Look, I know you're...

556
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:50,005
Hi, there.
So nice to meet you.

557
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:53,050
I love your tuxedo. Ls that Armani?

558
00:39:53,159 --> 00:39:55,969
I'm the one
who gets you there.

559
00:39:56,079 --> 00:39:58,320
I win these things.

560
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:01,449
So, why don't
we pool our resources?

561
00:40:01,519 --> 00:40:05,411
I'll bring in my boys, and you
and Jeannie bring in yours,

562
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:07,608
and we'll work together and get

563
00:40:07,679 --> 00:40:08,726
the right team around you

564
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:13,202
and there's just no telling
where this stops.

565
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:14,929
You with me?

566
00:40:18,639 --> 00:40:20,050
Absolutely.

567
00:40:23,079 --> 00:40:25,003
We should
definitely keep talking.

568
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:28,206
It was very nice
to finally meet you.

569
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:55,809
You should see my friend, Clio.

570
00:41:42,559 --> 00:41:45,039
Care for a nightcap,
Congressman?

571
00:41:48,719 --> 00:41:50,608
What, are you drunk?

572
00:41:50,679 --> 00:41:52,170
You're not drunk enough.

573
00:41:52,239 --> 00:41:56,324
Would you come to bed?
We should be celebrating.

574
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:59,289
Aren't you excited?

575
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:02,409
We would be scrutinized
under a microscope.

576
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:03,527
You know that, right?

577
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:05,364
Do we have anything to hide?

578
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:09,248
Of course not.

579
00:42:10,239 --> 00:42:13,164
But you know
these campaigns get personal.

580
00:42:13,239 --> 00:42:16,050
Certain level
of brutality, exposure.

581
00:42:16,119 --> 00:42:18,599
Just want to make sure
it's the right moment

582
00:42:18,719 --> 00:42:20,369
while James is so young.

583
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:21,929
Well, James
isn't like his friends.

584
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,364
He obsesses about presidents

585
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:25,601
the way other boys
obsess about dinosaurs.

586
00:42:25,679 --> 00:42:30,527
I mean, isn't this exactly
what you always wanted?

587
00:42:32,519 --> 00:42:35,000
What?

588
00:42:35,079 --> 00:42:38,481
I just noticed how adorable
you are in my shirt.

589
00:42:38,559 --> 00:42:40,960
I just... right now.
Come here.

590
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:17,010
Come back up here.

591
00:43:24,599 --> 00:43:26,887
No, no. Don't do that.
Unh-unh.

592
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:28,519
This way.

593
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:53,405
I love you.

594
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:58,724
I know all the sacrifices
you've made for this.

595
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:02,327
I'm just not sure about Hiller.

596
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:03,844
Everybody knows
he plays dirty.

597
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:06,081
Well, his candidates win.

598
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,480
I need to know
you still really want this.

599
00:44:15,679 --> 00:44:22,369
That you're the same
idealistic guy I fell for

600
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:24,806
who's gonna change the world.

601
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:27,849
Maybe one with a little
less hair, but yeah.

602
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:29,684
Same guy, <i>I</i> hope-

603
00:44:31,159 --> 00:44:32,684
Then I'll be there.

604
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:36,610
I believe in you, Sam.

605
00:44:37,719 --> 00:44:40,768
Just do whatever you need
to do to make it happen.

606
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:06,686
<i>Executive privilege.</i>

607
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:10,206
Hi, this is Bob Fisher
calling back.

608
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:13,891
I'd like to make an
appointment with... with Clio.

609
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:17,965
<i>Hi, Bob. Yes, Clio.</i>

610
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:25,447
Christy had said
she'd tell her about me.

611
00:45:25,519 --> 00:45:29,730
<i>I'm sorry, Bob-She 's out
of town at the moment.</i>

612
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:32,326
Well, when will she be back?

613
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:33,844
<i>I'm not sure.</i>

614
00:45:35,159 --> 00:45:36,570
Well, when will you know?

615
00:45:36,639 --> 00:45:39,927
I don't know, but I... I can
make a note to call you.

616
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,809
Okay.

617
00:45:43,679 --> 00:45:46,889
<i>Is there another girl
you'd be interested in?</i>

618
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:49,280
<i>Did you look at Donna
on our website?</i>

619
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:51,123
<i>She's available.</i>

620
00:45:51,199 --> 00:45:53,601
Donna, yeah.

621
00:45:53,679 --> 00:45:55,648
The brunette.

622
00:45:55,719 --> 00:45:56,721
<i>Right.</i>

623
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:59,929
Yeah, that's fine.

624
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,286
Sure.

625
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:06,764
When?

626
00:46:08,199 --> 00:46:10,601
You know, I've been asking myself
what possible wisdom

627
00:46:10,679 --> 00:46:14,286
I can impart to the bright
young minds of tomorrow.

628
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:17,568
<i>And I was gonna say,
"Be anyone you want to be."</i>

629
00:46:17,639 --> 00:46:20,768
<i>If you want to be an attorney,
be an attorney.</i>

630
00:46:23,159 --> 00:46:27,244
<i>You want to be a ballerina,
be a ballerina.</i>

631
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:29,527
<i>If you want to be a fireman,
be a fireman</i>

632
00:46:29,639 --> 00:46:31,483
<i>or an astronaut, or a playwright.</i>

633
00:46:31,599 --> 00:46:34,728
Technology.
I mean, he can talk directly...

634
00:46:38,519 --> 00:46:42,001
<i>But then I realized, that's ridiculous.</i>

635
00:46:42,079 --> 00:46:44,764
When are we gonna talk about ethics
reform and campaign finance?

636
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:49,925
<i>I can't be a ballerina,</i>

637
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:54,608
<i>an astronaut, or a playwright.</i>

638
00:46:54,679 --> 00:46:56,728
<i>I'm just not built that way.</i>

639
00:46:58,039 --> 00:46:59,929
<i>Because, really,
you can only be you.</i>

640
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,650
Get your message across.

641
00:47:01,719 --> 00:47:04,086
<i>But maybe that's what I'll impart.</i>

642
00:47:04,159 --> 00:47:05,730
<i>Be you.</i>

643
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:08,240
Coaker's piece.
Morning, Sam.

644
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:12,324
<i>Whoever that is.</i>

645
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:15,050
<i>Be honest about your weaknesses,</i>

646
00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:18,646
<i>but capitalize on your strengths.</i>

647
00:47:18,719 --> 00:47:21,849
Get to the core
of who you really are,

648
00:47:22,679 --> 00:47:26,650
<i>because the sooner
you figure out who that is,</i>

649
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:29,246
<i>the sooner you can decide
which grad school</i>

650
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:31,048
<i>to blow 100 grand on.</i>

651
00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:32,769
Thank you.

652
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:06,606
Does this bother you?

653
00:48:07,039 --> 00:48:08,724
No.
No?

654
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:11,646
I can touch you any way I like?

655
00:48:11,719 --> 00:48:13,563
Uh-huh.

656
00:48:13,639 --> 00:48:14,721
Huh?

657
00:48:23,199 --> 00:48:25,931
What if some guy wanted
to cum in your eye?

658
00:48:27,039 --> 00:48:29,168
On those pretty lashes.

659
00:48:35,559 --> 00:48:37,130
You're so pretty.

660
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:41,764
Why do you let guys
do this shit to you?

661
00:48:41,840 --> 00:48:44,161
I don't know.

662
00:48:44,239 --> 00:48:46,719
It's just what
some guys are like.

663
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:49,485
Well, some guys
aren't supposed to be.

664
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:54,487
Especially in my line of work.

665
00:48:54,559 --> 00:48:57,927
Doesn't make
a difference, does it?

666
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,525
That's not the point.

667
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:07,202
It's just basic
human engineering.

668
00:49:08,119 --> 00:49:10,599
Fighting that really
make you a better person?

669
00:49:10,679 --> 00:49:12,967
The world doesn't work
the way it does when you're 19.

670
00:49:13,039 --> 00:49:14,166
You'll see.

671
00:49:14,239 --> 00:49:15,286
Oh, whatever.

672
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:18,489
Rules are just rules
someone made up.

673
00:49:18,599 --> 00:49:20,806
None of my clients are 19.

674
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:22,563
And most of them are married.

675
00:49:22,639 --> 00:49:24,641
If that makes you
feel any better.

676
00:49:24,719 --> 00:49:26,289
I didn't say I was married.

677
00:49:28,199 --> 00:49:29,644
Sorry.

678
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:32,168
I talk too much.

679
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:34,969
Don't get mad, okay?

680
00:49:35,039 --> 00:49:37,007
I just don't see why
pretending you're someone

681
00:49:37,079 --> 00:49:40,128
you're not makes you any better.
That's all.

682
00:49:40,199 --> 00:49:42,646
You sure you're
okay doing this?

683
00:49:42,719 --> 00:49:43,561
I mean, come on.

684
00:49:43,639 --> 00:49:45,608
Isn't there something
better out there for you?

685
00:49:45,679 --> 00:49:49,001
Did you have
a favorite subject in school?

686
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:52,242
I like what I do.

687
00:49:54,360 --> 00:49:55,929
And I like you.

688
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:02,050
You want to see me again?

689
00:50:02,119 --> 00:50:04,804
I never see the same girl twice.

690
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:06,802
Oh, poor Bob.

691
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:10,728
It's okay
to come out and play.

692
00:50:37,599 --> 00:50:40,251
We knew Sam
was destined for politics,

693
00:50:40,320 --> 00:50:42,322
but I always thought
Jeannie would end up

694
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:44,481
being a prosecutor.

695
00:50:44,599 --> 00:50:46,728
Really? Me? Wow.

696
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:48,925
You're the one
with the background.

697
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,728
You could jump back
in any time you wanted.

698
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:51,925
Probably.

699
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,320
I just didn't realize
I'd miss James so much

700
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:55,686
being in the office all day.

701
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:56,601
I get it.

702
00:50:56,679 --> 00:50:58,125
Your charity work
will look better

703
00:50:58,239 --> 00:50:59,570
on a first lady's résumé.

704
00:50:59,639 --> 00:51:00,641
Oh, god.

705
00:51:00,719 --> 00:51:02,244
No pressure, Sam.

706
00:51:06,519 --> 00:51:08,123
Who wants dessert?

707
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:13,565
Sam.

708
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:16,164
Come in.

709
00:51:18,719 --> 00:51:21,563
Pollan's calling
a press conference for next week.

710
00:51:21,679 --> 00:51:23,090
Thought you said
we had a year.

711
00:51:23,159 --> 00:51:25,969
It doesn't matter what I thought.
I couldn't hold him off any longer.

712
00:51:26,039 --> 00:51:27,086
But what about Stiegel?

713
00:51:27,159 --> 00:51:29,288
Am I supposed to drop the
case in somebody else's lap?

714
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:31,327
Pollan's got cancer.

715
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:33,681
And it's getting worse.

716
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:35,842
I'm... I'm sorry about that.

717
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:40,643
Look, Sam, I... I know
you wanted to try that case,

718
00:51:40,719 --> 00:51:42,289
and I respect you for that,

719
00:51:42,360 --> 00:51:45,090
and I know that Kirkland's
probably gonna come down on you,

720
00:51:45,159 --> 00:51:47,686
but this field is gonna
get real crowded real fast

721
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:49,000
once the news gets out.

722
00:51:49,079 --> 00:51:51,081
This is game time.

723
00:51:51,159 --> 00:51:53,561
You announce,
Coaker writes his piece,

724
00:51:53,639 --> 00:51:54,846
you're the man to beat.

725
00:51:54,920 --> 00:51:55,967
Okay.

726
00:51:56,360 --> 00:51:59,045
"Okay"?
Is your head in this?

727
00:51:59,119 --> 00:52:01,407
Yeah, I'm good. Just took
me by surprise, that's all.

728
00:52:01,480 --> 00:52:05,804
Well, this is the perfect time
to get used to surprises.

729
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:08,201
You ought to get yourself
some bigger nuts.

730
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:09,405
You got one week.

731
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:30,525
<i>Executive privilege.</i>

732
00:52:30,599 --> 00:52:31,885
Yes, hello.
This is Bob Fisher.

733
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,842
I need to cancel
all my upcoming appointments.

734
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:35,724
Things are a bit crazed right now.

735
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:37,085
<i>Oh, that's too bad, Bob.</i>

736
00:52:37,159 --> 00:52:39,606
<i>I have a note here from Clio
to tell you that she's in town.</i>

737
00:52:39,679 --> 00:52:41,045
<i>Just for three days, though.</i>

738
00:52:41,119 --> 00:52:44,043
<i>She knows you've been inquiring,
and she's willing to meet.</i>

739
00:52:44,119 --> 00:52:45,769
Clio?

740
00:52:45,840 --> 00:52:50,128
<i>Her schedule's almost full,
but she's free Tuesday.</i>

741
00:52:50,199 --> 00:52:52,601
No, that's fine.
Thank you.

742
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:58,402
Constantino
is running for sure.

743
00:52:58,519 --> 00:53:00,681
There's no way
that's happening.

744
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:02,364
Please give me
another viable name.

745
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:03,440
Bradford.

746
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:04,481
Bradford?
Mm-hmm.

747
00:53:17,639 --> 00:53:19,005
I like your pictures.
Noted.

748
00:53:19,079 --> 00:53:21,081
She's got charisma,
but she doesn't have money.

749
00:53:21,159 --> 00:53:22,365
She doesn't have donors.

750
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:25,045
Constantino's gonna top
our million in commitments

751
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:26,166
by the end of this week.

752
00:53:26,239 --> 00:53:27,445
Constantino.

753
00:53:27,519 --> 00:53:28,726
Running or not running?

754
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:30,608
He'll run if I don't.

755
00:53:30,679 --> 00:53:33,251
Oh, I like the balls on this guy.

756
00:53:33,320 --> 00:53:35,242
This is what I like.
This is what we're selling.

757
00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:39,041
Confidence, hope, optimism
versus a three-time loser.

758
00:53:39,119 --> 00:53:41,168
Success versus failure, all right?

759
00:53:41,239 --> 00:53:43,527
Versus corruption, actually.

760
00:53:43,599 --> 00:53:46,001
Ideas? E.J.'S right, guys. I
just think we need a platform

761
00:53:46,079 --> 00:53:48,047
before we want to start
getting the message out.

762
00:53:48,159 --> 00:53:50,242
I want to have the announcement
on a college campus.

763
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:52,925
I want him surrounded by people under 30.
Yeah? Under 30.

764
00:53:53,039 --> 00:53:55,849
I want him swimming in people
under 30, you understand?

765
00:54:02,679 --> 00:54:03,760
Hello?

766
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:07,561
<i>Hi, is this Bob?</i>

767
00:54:07,599 --> 00:54:08,726
Yes.

768
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:09,960
<i>Hey, it's Laci.</i>

769
00:54:10,039 --> 00:54:12,565
<i>I'm... I'm sorry
to call you directly,</i>

770
00:54:12,639 --> 00:54:14,768
<i>but I might be
changing agencies,</i>

771
00:54:14,840 --> 00:54:17,047
<i>and I just wanted you
to have my number.</i>

772
00:54:17,119 --> 00:54:18,119
<i>Can you talk?</i>

773
00:54:18,840 --> 00:54:20,284
Not exactly.

774
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:24,884
<i>I... I just wanted you to know</i>

775
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:27,565
<i>how much I enjoyed
the other day.</i>

776
00:54:27,639 --> 00:54:31,041
<i>And it'd be great
to see you again.</i>

777
00:54:34,119 --> 00:54:37,202
Okay, well, I... I have it now.

778
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:38,769
<i>Yeah.</i>

779
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:41,047
<i>I'm sorry again.</i>

780
00:54:41,119 --> 00:54:42,360
<i>I hope I'll see you soon.</i>

781
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:43,565
Okay.

782
00:54:43,639 --> 00:54:44,971
Okay, bye.

783
00:54:52,039 --> 00:54:53,804
What phone was that?

784
00:54:55,559 --> 00:54:57,289
FBl phone.

785
00:54:57,360 --> 00:55:00,329
They heard something
on the wire, needed advice.

786
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:02,760
I'll see you tonight, okay?

787
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:04,204
Of course.

788
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:24,847
They're kind of overpriced.

789
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:27,525
That's the point.
It's my treat.

790
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:30,411
Isn't my wife a knockout?

791
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:32,561
Yeah, very flattering.

792
00:55:32,679 --> 00:55:33,726
She gets self-conscious.

793
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:36,326
I understand.
A lot of women do.

794
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:38,083
Where are you from?

795
00:55:38,159 --> 00:55:39,650
Brazil.
Brazil? Wow.

796
00:55:39,719 --> 00:55:41,449
Never been.

797
00:55:41,519 --> 00:55:42,559
I think you would like it.

798
00:55:42,599 --> 00:55:43,840
Probably would.

799
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:45,045
What's your name?

800
00:55:45,119 --> 00:55:47,851
Tora.
Ah. Sam.

801
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:49,842
Do you think
they're too young for me?

802
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:51,409
Not at all.
They're stunning.

803
00:55:51,480 --> 00:55:52,606
We'll take them.

804
00:55:54,679 --> 00:55:56,523
You didn't miss anything
at the conference.

805
00:55:56,599 --> 00:55:58,204
Your son is a model student.

806
00:55:58,280 --> 00:55:59,565
Good.

807
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:05,608
I'm sorry, sir,
but your card was declined.

808
00:56:05,679 --> 00:56:06,679
It was?

809
00:56:06,719 --> 00:56:08,085
It's probably just the machine.

810
00:56:08,159 --> 00:56:10,606
It happens every now and then.
Would you like me to call them?

811
00:56:10,719 --> 00:56:12,722
No, no, no.
It's fine. Try this one.

812
00:56:14,519 --> 00:56:15,362
Hm.

813
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:16,965
What have you been buying lately?

814
00:56:21,159 --> 00:56:22,809
Everything okay?

815
00:56:28,840 --> 00:56:30,409
What's going on, Sam?

816
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:31,811
What?

817
00:56:33,079 --> 00:56:35,242
I thought we were having
a nice afternoon together.

818
00:56:35,320 --> 00:56:37,447
Yeah, I'm just not sure
why you felt that I needed

819
00:56:37,559 --> 00:56:40,847
a $400 pair of sunglasses
right at this exact moment.

820
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:43,001
You know, Jeannie, I took
time out of my schedule,

821
00:56:43,079 --> 00:56:46,686
I canceled an appointment.
I just... With whom?

822
00:56:46,760 --> 00:56:49,445
Is this about the... the
Brazilian girl at the store?

823
00:56:49,519 --> 00:56:52,204
No.

824
00:56:52,280 --> 00:56:53,690
But now that you mention it,

825
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:56,286
that was fucking embarrassing.

826
00:56:57,039 --> 00:56:59,041
If you really are going
to become a candidate...

827
00:56:59,119 --> 00:57:00,246
If I become a candidate?

828
00:57:00,320 --> 00:57:01,400
You're gonna have to learn

829
00:57:01,519 --> 00:57:03,248
to deal with flattery
from girls like that.

830
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:05,402
You can't just buy
whatever shit they're selling.

831
00:57:05,480 --> 00:57:08,927
What's bothering you, Jeannie? Just say it.
Just spit it out. Ls there someone else?

832
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:15,090
No.

833
00:57:15,199 --> 00:57:16,485
I don't believe you.
I'm sorry.

834
00:57:16,559 --> 00:57:19,210
Well, what am I supposed
to do about it?

835
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:21,327
There's nobody else.

836
00:58:33,400 --> 00:58:34,686
Come on.

00:58:39,599 --> 00:58:40,806

838
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:42,483
Yes, it's Bob Fisher.

839
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:44,289
Does Clio still have
any times available?

840
00:58:44,360 --> 00:58:47,329
<i>Hey, Bob-Yes, she
does-Five o'clock.</i>

841
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:48,525
Today?

842
00:58:48,599 --> 00:58:51,728
<i>Yes, today.
You want me to pencil you in?</i>

843
00:58:51,800 --> 00:58:54,201
Okay, I'll take it. Where?

844
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:57,170
We have two officers
that are gonna be contacts.

845
00:59:15,360 --> 00:59:16,565
How'd it go today?

846
00:59:16,679 --> 00:59:17,601
<i>All right, I suppose.</i>

847
00:59:17,679 --> 00:59:20,081
Sam's not exactly
an open book, but he's good.

848
00:59:20,199 --> 00:59:21,929
He's very, very good
at what he does.

849
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,889
It's only 4:30.
He's done already?

850
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:26,690
No, I think he's got a five o'clock.

851
00:59:26,760 --> 00:59:29,081
<i>Outside the office.</i>

852
00:59:29,159 --> 00:59:31,083

853
00:59:37,519 --> 00:59:39,726
Hi, I need to check
the balance of my card.

854
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:41,210
It was declined.

855
00:59:44,360 --> 00:59:46,646
All right, what are
my options for payment?

856
00:59:46,719 --> 00:59:48,688
2,000.

857
00:59:50,280 --> 00:59:52,009
Can I open a line of credit?

858
01:00:09,119 --> 01:00:10,530
Fuck!

859
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:19,802
Shit!

860
01:00:19,880 --> 01:00:21,085
Sorry.

861
01:00:25,880 --> 01:00:27,291
Come on.

862
01:00:40,840 --> 01:00:42,329
Are you all right?

863
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:44,289
You okay?
Hey, just stay down.

864
01:00:44,360 --> 01:00:45,599
No.
You sure?

865
01:00:45,679 --> 01:00:46,726

I'm not gonna be able
to make my appointment today,

870
01:02:18,280 --> 01:02:20,407
but I...

871

I... I think you may be
under investigation.

I don't know, I just...

873
01:02:24,840 --> 01:02:27,684
I think they have
surveillance at Clio's hotel.

874
01:02:27,760 --> 01:02:29,250
I could be wrong.

No. No, I can't.
I'm sorry.

878
01:02:35,280 --> 01:02:36,565
Just destroy your records.

879
01:02:36,639 --> 01:02:38,722
Just do whatever you need to do.

880
01:02:38,800 --> 01:02:40,244

What happened? Why were you
at the Saint Regency Hotel?

887
01:03:56,800 --> 01:03:58,927
You can interrogate me later.
Just let me rest.

Sure.

889
01:04:00,679 --> 01:04:01,965

01:04:06,199 --> 01:04:08,202
This? What the fuck is this?

892
01:04:08,320 --> 01:04:09,650
<i>Hmm?</i>

893
01:04:09,719 --> 01:04:11,960
Hush money for your girlfriend?

894
01:04:12,039 --> 01:04:13,405
It's...

895
01:04:13,480 --> 01:04:14,686
It's a donation.

896
01:04:16,679 --> 01:04:17,806
You don't treat me

897
01:04:17,880 --> 01:04:21,407
like some stupid
suburban housewife, Sam.

898
01:04:21,480 --> 01:04:24,085
I outpaced you
in every fucking law class.

899
01:04:24,159 --> 01:04:27,686
I was earning a higher salary
than you until...

900
01:04:27,800 --> 01:04:29,563
Fuck me.

901
01:04:30,360 --> 01:04:32,202
I don't understand.
You're my best friend.

902
01:04:32,280 --> 01:04:34,851
You don't do this kind of thing.
Not to me.

903
01:04:37,400 --> 01:04:38,969
The nurse said
you fractured a rib.

904
01:04:39,039 --> 01:04:41,088
I wouldn't move too much.

905
01:04:46,119 --> 01:04:49,840
What am I supposed to do?
Do I... should I leave?

906
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:51,489
'Cause I won't be the victim here.

907
01:04:51,559 --> 01:04:52,960
You saw what that did
to my parents.

908
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:54,364
I'll walk before that happens.

909
01:04:54,440 --> 01:04:55,440
We're not your parents.

910
01:04:55,519 --> 01:04:58,126
Then get it together.

911
01:04:59,199 --> 01:05:00,360
If not for me, do it for James.

912
01:05:00,440 --> 01:05:03,204
He looks to you
for how to behave.

913
01:05:03,280 --> 01:05:06,523
And whatever mess you're in,

914
01:05:06,599 --> 01:05:08,920
you need to dig yourself
out of it now.

915
01:05:10,360 --> 01:05:12,088
I'm going to get our son.

916
01:05:40,559 --> 01:05:42,050
<i>We 're sorry.</i>

917
01:05:42,119 --> 01:05:44,282
<i>You have reached a number
that has been disconnected</i>

918
01:05:44,360 --> 01:05:47,204
<i>or is no longer in service.</i>

919
01:05:49,480 --> 01:05:50,322
Hello.

920
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:53,050
Noah, it's Sam. I need you to
check something out for me.

921
01:05:53,119 --> 01:05:55,121
<i>Sure. What's up?</i>

922
01:05:59,400 --> 01:06:01,846
Nigel Coaker called three times.

923
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:03,119
I don't want to talk to him.

924
01:06:03,159 --> 01:06:06,606
Noah's in your office
with the meeting you asked for.

925
01:06:06,679 --> 01:06:07,806
Okay.

926
01:06:08,440 --> 01:06:10,090
It's been mostly FBI so far.

927
01:06:10,159 --> 01:06:11,923
We've handled
a couple of warrants.

928
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:13,364
They put in a request for a wire,

929
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:14,679
but I think it's too late.

930
01:06:14,760 --> 01:06:16,125
The agency's rolling up fast.

931
01:06:16,239 --> 01:06:17,365
What do we know?

932
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:19,840
Some interstate,
some international activity.

933
01:06:19,920 --> 01:06:21,523
For the right price,
a V.I.P. client

934
01:06:21,639 --> 01:06:24,324
could bring a prostitute
to New York or Paris.

935
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:26,681
At the very least, I think we've
got them on the Mann Act.

936
01:06:26,719 --> 01:06:28,722
You sure about that?

937
01:06:28,800 --> 01:06:31,121
Not 100%.

938
01:06:31,199 --> 01:06:32,485
And the agents
want to move now?

939
01:06:32,559 --> 01:06:33,447
Who's on it?

940
01:06:33,519 --> 01:06:36,000
Park and Strellitz, solid guys.

941
01:06:36,079 --> 01:06:39,128
They don't want
to see it slip away.

942
01:06:39,199 --> 01:06:41,931
Well, I want to come
on board and help out.

943
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,161
And I'll lead the case.

944
01:06:44,239 --> 01:06:46,719
Is there a reason
you would need to, sir?

945
01:06:46,800 --> 01:06:47,608
Is there a problem?

946
01:06:47,679 --> 01:06:50,650
No. It's your call, of course.

947
01:06:50,719 --> 01:06:54,724
It's just I was hoping to try
the case if it came to that.

948
01:06:54,800 --> 01:06:55,686
Ah.

949
01:06:55,760 --> 01:06:57,568
I used to volunteer
at a clinic

950
01:06:57,639 --> 01:06:59,688
that helped prostitutes
get out and get clean,

951
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:02,603
and I saw a lot of girls
go through there.

952
01:07:02,679 --> 01:07:05,489
Even at the high end, there's a
pretty intense psychological toll.

953
01:07:05,559 --> 01:07:07,641
I think what Flynn
is trying to say, sir,

954
01:07:07,719 --> 01:07:09,768
is that we'd like
to stay on the case

955
01:07:09,840 --> 01:07:13,003
unless there's a compelling
reason for us to switch.

956
01:07:13,079 --> 01:07:15,844
You sure you want
to spend your time on this?

957
01:07:15,920 --> 01:07:18,490
You think I'm chasing headlines?
Is that it?

958
01:07:23,039 --> 01:07:25,088
You're right, Ms. Flynn.

959
01:07:25,159 --> 01:07:26,206
It is an important issue.

960
01:07:26,280 --> 01:07:27,929
And that's why I want
to be more involved.

961
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:31,048
I want to make sure
it stays on the right track.

962
01:07:31,119 --> 01:07:32,530
And if it goes to trial,

963
01:07:32,599 --> 01:07:34,489
you can have the case.
Fair deal?

964
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,286
All right, tell the agents
we're transferring the case.

965
01:07:38,360 --> 01:07:41,010
I want to see them in here
at their earliest convenience.

966
01:07:41,079 --> 01:07:42,764
Noah, hang back a sec.

967
01:07:46,760 --> 01:07:49,081
A buddy at the bureau
slipped me the lead on this,

968
01:07:49,159 --> 01:07:52,289
and I don't want to burn him,
so if anyone asks,

969
01:07:52,360 --> 01:07:54,123
I heard about it from you, okay?

970
01:07:54,199 --> 01:07:55,326
You got it, chief.

971
01:08:50,279 --> 01:08:52,122
James, honey, no.

972
01:08:54,920 --> 01:08:59,926
Otherwise, they're gonna
keep you back in that class.

973
01:09:15,479 --> 01:09:17,005
You Okay?

974
01:09:17,079 --> 01:09:18,524
Yeah.

975
01:09:18,600 --> 01:09:19,725
Fine.

976
01:09:19,840 --> 01:09:21,001
Can I take this?

977
01:09:21,079 --> 01:09:22,319
Sure. Already read it.

978
01:09:27,039 --> 01:09:28,087
Okay.

979
01:09:29,399 --> 01:09:31,050
See you tonight.

980
01:09:31,119 --> 01:09:32,689
Okay.

981
01:09:45,239 --> 01:09:47,402
<i>Word is the FBI sent
it upstairs yesterday.</i>

982
01:09:47,479 --> 01:09:48,845
Why the fuck would they do that?

983
01:09:48,920 --> 01:09:50,762
Look, I talked to my buddy
at main justice.

984
01:09:50,840 --> 01:09:51,886
<i>He said they split it.</i>

985
01:09:51,960 --> 01:09:53,291
<i>They bumped the case
to New York,</i>

986
01:09:53,359 --> 01:09:55,600
<i>and the rest is going to OPR,
which only happens</i>

987
01:09:55,680 --> 01:09:57,681
<i>if someone in this office
is implicated, right?</i>

988
01:09:57,760 --> 01:09:58,601
Jesus.

989
01:09:58,680 --> 01:10:00,125
Any idea who that might be?

990
01:10:02,840 --> 01:10:05,207
You know, Noah,
I'm gonna call you back.

991
01:10:30,920 --> 01:10:32,251
Jesus.

992
01:10:52,159 --> 01:10:54,367
<i>Hey. I know you called.
Leave a message.</i>

993
01:11:11,920 --> 01:11:13,159
<i>Detective Brixy.</i>

994
01:11:13,239 --> 01:11:14,287
Brixy, Sam Ellis.

995
01:11:14,359 --> 01:11:15,565
<i>Ellis, how you doing, man?</i>

996
01:11:15,640 --> 01:11:17,243
<i>You gonna nail Stiegel to the wall?</i>

997
01:11:17,319 --> 01:11:19,162
<i>You are a regular
fucking hero down here, man.</i>

998
01:11:19,239 --> 01:11:21,128
Yeah, I know.
Thanks.

999
01:11:21,199 --> 01:11:23,680
Couldn't have done it without
some solid police work, right?

1000
01:11:23,760 --> 01:11:25,444
I... I need you to run
a number for me.

1001
01:11:25,520 --> 01:11:26,885
I need an address.

1002
01:11:50,479 --> 01:11:51,890
Can I help you?

1003
01:11:53,359 --> 01:11:58,161
Yes. I... is Jennifer here?

1004
01:11:58,239 --> 01:11:59,240
Just a second.

1005
01:11:59,319 --> 01:12:00,605
Thank you.

1006
01:12:10,279 --> 01:12:11,610
Hi.

1007
01:12:11,720 --> 01:12:13,484
I'm sorry to bother you here.

1008
01:12:15,039 --> 01:12:16,962
It's Jennifer, right?

1009
01:12:17,039 --> 01:12:18,529
What the fuck
are you doing here?

1010
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:19,761
Can I come in?

1011
01:12:19,840 --> 01:12:20,681
My mom's in there.

1012
01:12:20,760 --> 01:12:22,603
It's really, really important.

1013
01:12:22,680 --> 01:12:25,159
Is there somewhere else
we can talk, then?

1014
01:12:27,800 --> 01:12:31,122
They already brought me in
for questioning this morning.

1015
01:12:31,239 --> 01:12:33,845
It sucked.
Cops really creep me out.

1016
01:12:33,920 --> 01:12:37,082
What did they ask you?

1017
01:12:37,159 --> 01:12:38,923
They said I can't discuss that.

1018
01:12:40,119 --> 01:12:43,805
Listen, you need to get
a... a message to the agency.

1019
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:47,128
You need to tell them not to
volunteer any information, okay?

1020
01:12:47,199 --> 01:12:48,360
The FBI doesn't have a case.

1021
01:12:48,439 --> 01:12:50,248
Everybody's in custody.
It doesn't...

1022
01:12:50,319 --> 01:12:51,923
No, I mean they got
every single person.

1023
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:53,364
You have to think
of a way, though.

1024
01:12:53,439 --> 01:12:55,600
There has to be some way
to get in touch with somebody.

1025
01:12:55,680 --> 01:12:57,283
There's nothing.
No, I'm...

1026
01:12:57,359 --> 01:12:59,567
What about the book? There is nothing.
They're gone.

1027
01:12:59,640 --> 01:13:02,239
Can you text somebody? One of the
other girls? What the fuck, man?

1028
01:13:02,279 --> 01:13:04,567
You think they're just gonna
use up their one phone call

1029
01:13:04,640 --> 01:13:06,608
to see how Laci's doing?
Just think! Just think!

1030
01:13:06,680 --> 01:13:10,969
Just think of everybody for me! Help me
out! There is nothing! They are gone!

1031
01:13:11,039 --> 01:13:12,087
Fuck.

1032
01:13:12,159 --> 01:13:15,243
I never even spoke
to them in person.

1033
01:13:15,319 --> 01:13:17,003
It was all just over the phone.

1034
01:13:17,119 --> 01:13:19,600
Fuck. I am so fucked.

1035
01:13:19,680 --> 01:13:22,286
This is...
I shouldn't have said anything.

1036
01:13:23,760 --> 01:13:25,841
You don't have anything
to worry about.

1037
01:13:40,640 --> 01:13:45,042
I recognize you, you know.

1038
01:13:45,119 --> 01:13:48,920
You're a lot better looking
in person than you are on TV.

1039
01:13:51,840 --> 01:13:56,083
I was gonna go poli-sci
before my mom got diagnosed.

1040
01:14:04,640 --> 01:14:06,688
She has cancer, doesn't she?

1041
01:14:09,920 --> 01:14:14,130
My mom died from cancer
when I was about your age.

1042
01:14:20,399 --> 01:14:21,845
You guys close?

1043
01:14:23,880 --> 01:14:26,689
Yeah.

1044
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:32,127
She was kind of out of control.

1045
01:14:33,319 --> 01:14:34,605
But...

1046
01:14:37,640 --> 01:14:40,246
I just got into this
to help her out.

1047
01:14:42,640 --> 01:14:43,845
I'm all she's got.

1048
01:14:50,479 --> 01:14:52,323
But once you're at the party...

1049
01:14:52,399 --> 01:14:54,481
You should get out.

1050
01:14:57,840 --> 01:15:00,207
I... I already switched agencies.

1051
01:15:02,479 --> 01:15:05,006
These guys have been
courting me for a while.

1052
01:15:05,079 --> 01:15:07,287
They're super discrete.

1053
01:15:21,159 --> 01:15:22,399
It's okay.

1054
01:15:34,520 --> 01:15:36,521
It's all good, right?
Yeah.

1055
01:15:36,600 --> 01:15:38,363
You don't have
to worry about anything.

1056
01:15:38,439 --> 01:15:40,123
Everything's gonna be fine.

1057
01:15:41,199 --> 01:15:42,485
Wait.

1058
01:15:45,159 --> 01:15:46,729
Can we...

1059
01:15:48,920 --> 01:15:51,207
I've got...

1060
01:15:53,760 --> 01:15:55,329
That's all I got.

1061
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,685
I can go to the bank
after if you want.

1062
01:16:07,520 --> 01:16:08,520
Right here?

1063
01:16:10,199 --> 01:16:11,485
Yeah.

1064
01:18:53,319 --> 01:18:55,368
Sorry I'm late.

1065
01:18:55,439 --> 01:18:57,442
All rise.

1066
01:18:58,159 --> 01:19:00,560
The honorable
Catherine Liu presiding.

1067
01:19:00,640 --> 01:19:04,564
Well, we're off to a roaring start.

1068
01:19:04,640 --> 01:19:08,042
Apologize for the delay,
Your Honor.

1069
01:19:08,119 --> 01:19:09,530
Be seated.

1070
01:19:09,600 --> 01:19:11,090
Not you, Mr. Ellis.

1071
01:19:11,159 --> 01:19:13,287
You're not going
to be here that long.

1072
01:19:13,359 --> 01:19:15,088
Let's hear your motions.

1073
01:19:17,039 --> 01:19:18,769
Right.

1074
01:19:28,439 --> 01:19:31,761
Hey, there's two FBI agents
that want to speak to you.

1075
01:19:31,840 --> 01:19:33,649
I put them in your office.
I hope that's okay.

1076
01:19:33,720 --> 01:19:35,244
That's fine.
Thank you, Dalia.

1077
01:19:35,319 --> 01:19:38,289
And next Friday's my last day.

1078
01:19:38,359 --> 01:19:39,850
I don't know if you knew that.

1079
01:19:41,239 --> 01:19:43,003
Let us know where you land.

1080
01:19:43,079 --> 01:19:45,923
And I wanted to apologize.

1081
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,525
I never meant to complicate
your life or... or your wife's.

1082
01:19:48,600 --> 01:19:50,125
You didn't.

1083
01:19:54,039 --> 01:19:55,962
Gentlemen.
Mr. Ellis.

1084
01:19:56,039 --> 01:19:57,849
Sam Ellis.
Agent Park.

1085
01:19:57,920 --> 01:19:59,887
I'm Agent Strellitz.
Agent Park.

1086
01:19:59,960 --> 01:20:01,449
Have a seat.

1087
01:20:01,520 --> 01:20:03,408
You know why we're here?

1088
01:20:03,479 --> 01:20:04,890
You tell me.

1089
01:20:05,800 --> 01:20:09,485
Why'd this get passed up to main?

1090
01:20:09,560 --> 01:20:14,247
How familiar are you
with Executive Privilege?

1091
01:20:14,319 --> 01:20:15,560
Not very.

1092
01:20:15,640 --> 01:20:18,211
I stepped in 'cause
I was concerned about

1093
01:20:18,279 --> 01:20:19,805
some of the warrants
y'all asked for.

1094
01:20:19,880 --> 01:20:21,564
How did you hear
about the case?

1095
01:20:21,640 --> 01:20:24,882
Noah, one of my AUSAs
told me about it.

1096
01:20:24,960 --> 01:20:28,247
Our investigation started with
a particular elected official

1097
01:20:28,319 --> 01:20:30,322
moving large sums
of money around.

1098
01:20:30,399 --> 01:20:32,323
We thought he might be
embezzling funds.

1099
01:20:32,399 --> 01:20:34,368
Turns out he was
a client at the agency.

1100
01:20:34,439 --> 01:20:35,770
<i>Hmm.</i>

1101
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:39,560
Started to build a list. High-profile
public officials, mostly state.

1102
01:20:39,640 --> 01:20:41,319
All of whom are clients
and many of whom...

1103
01:20:41,359 --> 01:20:42,690
And many of whom

1104
01:20:42,760 --> 01:20:45,764
were social friends
of a colleague of yours here.

1105
01:20:48,079 --> 01:20:50,650
Kirkland?

1106
01:20:50,720 --> 01:20:54,725
We think maybe they asked him
to hold up the investigation.

1107
01:20:54,800 --> 01:20:56,643
Has he ever mentioned
the case to you?

1108
01:20:56,720 --> 01:20:58,484
No. Not at all.

1109
01:20:58,560 --> 01:21:02,006
He ever mention the agency
or prostitution in general?

1110
01:21:02,079 --> 01:21:04,162
Maybe the occasional
off-color comment.

1111
01:21:04,239 --> 01:21:05,685
We're using an escort
as a witness

1112
01:21:05,760 --> 01:21:07,284
on an unrelated
identity theft case,

1113
01:21:07,359 --> 01:21:11,444
but I believe she worked
for a different agency.

1114
01:21:11,520 --> 01:21:14,921
And you yourself
have never had any contact

1115
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:19,926
with the agency
or any of its employees?

1116
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,240
Not that I'm aware of.

1117
01:21:22,319 --> 01:21:25,926
You were in the hospital
on Tuesday, is that correct?

1118
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,082
Yes, I was hit by a car
crossing the street.

1119
01:21:28,159 --> 01:21:30,685
Then you passed out four blocks
from the Saint Regency Hotel.

1120
01:21:30,760 --> 01:21:32,444
I'm not really sure
where I passed out.

1121
01:21:32,520 --> 01:21:34,443
The police report
could clarify that.

1122
01:21:34,520 --> 01:21:37,126
I'd be careful here, fellas.

1123
01:21:39,479 --> 01:21:41,083
Do you have a case?

1124
01:21:41,880 --> 01:21:44,850
'Cause it sounds
like you're fishing.

1125
01:21:44,960 --> 01:21:48,680
That's exactly why I wanted
to check the warrants.

1126
01:21:48,760 --> 01:21:50,125
If you have any information

1127
01:21:50,199 --> 01:21:51,884
that could assist the investigation,

1128
01:21:51,960 --> 01:21:55,282
We'd be extremely...
Do you have a case?

1129
01:21:55,359 --> 01:21:58,603
We suspect that
someone tipped the agency.

1130
01:21:59,520 --> 01:22:01,841
They started rolling up,
destroying all their records.

1131
01:22:01,920 --> 01:22:04,240
That's why we moved in.

1132
01:22:04,319 --> 01:22:06,926
But we think we were too late.

1133
01:22:07,880 --> 01:22:09,041
Okay.

1134
01:22:09,960 --> 01:22:13,088
So, you gonna charge them
with something?

1135
01:22:18,159 --> 01:22:19,490
No.

1136
01:22:23,560 --> 01:22:25,608
Well, hopefully
you'll get them next time.

1137
01:22:26,239 --> 01:22:27,810
Y'all should've come to me first.

1138
01:22:29,319 --> 01:22:32,688
It was nice to meet you.
Mm-hmm.

1139
01:22:32,800 --> 01:22:34,131
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

1140
01:22:39,399 --> 01:22:42,404
Are you a married man, Mr. Ellis?

1141
01:22:42,479 --> 01:22:45,801
13 years.

1142
01:22:45,880 --> 01:22:48,280
I'm married 38 years myself.

1143
01:22:49,640 --> 01:22:51,881
I've seen every kind of husband.

1144
01:22:51,960 --> 01:22:53,882
Heard every justification
you can imagine

1145
01:22:53,960 --> 01:22:57,009
for every sort of indiscretion.

1146
01:22:57,079 --> 01:22:58,649
Guys telling themselves

1147
01:22:58,720 --> 01:23:02,167
it's just a little vacation
from reality.

1148
01:23:02,239 --> 01:23:07,246
Or that they're some other guy
when they step into that room.

1149
01:23:08,600 --> 01:23:12,127
But I have seen
grown men break down

1150
01:23:12,199 --> 01:23:15,841
and cry when the chickens
come home.

1151
01:23:15,920 --> 01:23:17,842
Even if you're
getting away with it,

1152
01:23:17,920 --> 01:23:21,242
you only get to be one person
under the eyes of god.

1153
01:23:21,319 --> 01:23:22,923
And these guys,

1154
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:26,765
they got to be asking themselves
at the end of the day

1155
01:23:26,840 --> 01:23:32,243
if you're the guy
that walks through that door

1156
01:23:32,359 --> 01:23:33,690
or if you're not.

1157
01:23:36,520 --> 01:23:38,170
Have a good day, counselor.

1158
01:24:18,119 --> 01:24:24,047
You know, they say that
jogging is shit for the knees.

1159
01:24:24,159 --> 01:24:26,242
So I hear.

1160
01:24:26,319 --> 01:24:28,368
You followed me?

1161
01:24:28,439 --> 01:24:30,646
You want to grab a coffee?

1162
01:24:30,720 --> 01:24:32,404
We need to have a chat.

1163
01:24:35,039 --> 01:24:36,882
How's your lovely wife?

1164
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:40,925
She's probably sitting
a lot more than I have lately.

1165
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:44,481
I heard you had a visit
from the FBI today.

1166
01:24:46,760 --> 01:24:48,250
They were briefing me on a case.

1167
01:24:48,319 --> 01:24:51,130
Mm. Ls that all?

1168
01:24:51,239 --> 01:24:54,608
That's funny 'cause my sources

1169
01:24:54,680 --> 01:24:56,886
said it was
a little bit more than that.

1170
01:24:58,000 --> 01:24:59,489
Yeah?

1171
01:24:59,560 --> 01:25:00,925
What did they say?

1172
01:25:08,279 --> 01:25:09,770
I think you know.

1173
01:25:11,159 --> 01:25:12,445
<i>Hmm?</i>

1174
01:25:16,560 --> 01:25:18,608
You know they haven't got
a case against you, Sam,

1175
01:25:18,680 --> 01:25:21,126
and there's no doubt
the pressure from the top

1176
01:25:21,199 --> 01:25:24,090
will get them to drop it.

1177
01:25:24,159 --> 01:25:27,368
And from where I sit, I still
think people have the right

1178
01:25:27,439 --> 01:25:32,605
to know the truth
about their assistant U.S. Attorney

1179
01:25:32,680 --> 01:25:36,685
and aspiring future congressman.

1180
01:25:58,520 --> 01:26:00,681
You know,
it's really the hypocrisy

1181
01:26:00,800 --> 01:26:02,881
that offends most people,

1182
01:26:02,960 --> 01:26:05,485
and you're quite good
at fooling everyone.

1183
01:26:05,560 --> 01:26:09,689
But soon, people are gonna
know what you really are.

1184
01:26:09,760 --> 01:26:12,684
Then they can make up
their own mind about it.

1185
01:26:14,319 --> 01:26:17,448
Now, I want
to give you the chance

1186
01:26:17,520 --> 01:26:21,161
to tell me your own story
and maybe...

1187
01:26:21,239 --> 01:26:24,721
maybe they will forgive you

1188
01:26:24,800 --> 01:26:26,324
if you make them understand.

1189
01:26:26,399 --> 01:26:28,003
When are you running the piece?

1190
01:26:28,079 --> 01:26:29,206
Soon.

1191
01:26:37,680 --> 01:26:40,206
I have nothing
to say at this time.

1192
01:26:41,840 --> 01:26:43,682
<i>Edward Pollan,
the three-term senator</i>

1193
01:26:43,800 --> 01:26:45,847
<i>announced today
that he intends to retire</i>

1194
01:26:45,920 --> 01:26:48,161
<i>at the end of the current
legislative session.</i>

1195
01:26:48,239 --> 01:26:50,890
<i>The unexpected decision
leaves the playing field wide open</i>

1196
01:26:50,960 --> 01:26:54,168
<i>given POllan's
17-year tenure in the office.</i>

1197
01:26:54,239 --> 01:26:57,243
<i>Normally one
of the Senate's most outspoken...</i>

1198
01:27:03,159 --> 01:27:04,570
Yeah.

1199
01:27:04,640 --> 01:27:07,086
Yeah. Want
cheese on your burger?

1200
01:27:07,239 --> 01:27:08,287
Yeah.

1201
01:27:08,359 --> 01:27:09,565
Yeah.

1202
01:27:10,800 --> 01:27:12,006
Hi, Mom.

1203
01:27:18,159 --> 01:27:19,365
Here you go.

1204
01:27:21,119 --> 01:27:22,929
Can I give Jack
a lettuce leaf?

1205
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:25,605
Sure. Just wash
your hands, okay?

1206
01:27:29,079 --> 01:27:31,480
So, where have you been?

1207
01:27:32,920 --> 01:27:34,206
Around.

1208
01:27:35,359 --> 01:27:39,729
I saw the announcement.
You talk to Hiller?

1209
01:27:39,800 --> 01:27:40,926
Not yet.

1210
01:27:43,079 --> 01:27:44,809
He wanted some
photographs of your mother

1211
01:27:44,880 --> 01:27:50,125
for the website.
There's a box in my office.

1212
01:27:56,119 --> 01:27:58,520
Back to business.

1213
01:28:00,640 --> 01:28:03,086
Something wrong?

1214
01:28:03,159 --> 01:28:06,686
No, sweetie.
Just... just hungry.

1215
01:28:55,039 --> 01:28:56,484
Thank you.

1216
01:29:03,319 --> 01:29:04,810
Just take your time.

1217
01:29:15,920 --> 01:29:21,006
If I talk to you, will you
give me time to resign

1218
01:29:21,079 --> 01:29:23,127
and get my affairs in order?

1219
01:29:23,199 --> 01:29:26,601
That's a poor choice
of words, but okay.

1220
01:29:34,840 --> 01:29:38,970
Well, first, I... I want
to apologize to my family,

1221
01:29:39,039 --> 01:29:42,487
to my wife and son

1222
01:29:42,560 --> 01:29:44,641
and my colleagues
at the U.S. Attorney's office,

1223
01:29:44,720 --> 01:29:48,042
with whom it has been
a great honor

1224
01:29:48,119 --> 01:29:50,042
and privilege to serve.

1225
01:29:51,840 --> 01:29:53,729
There are no excuses.

1226
01:30:01,199 --> 01:30:03,122
Why take the risk?

1227
01:30:09,039 --> 01:30:10,451
I don't know.

1228
01:30:13,560 --> 01:30:18,042
I don't know. It's gonna take
me a long time to figure out.

1229
01:30:18,720 --> 01:30:21,484
Jeannie thinks the world of you.

1230
01:30:22,920 --> 01:30:26,447
Off the record.

1231
01:30:26,520 --> 01:30:28,806
How are you gonna
break it to her?

1232
01:30:30,920 --> 01:30:34,002
Well, she already knows, I think.

1233
01:30:34,079 --> 01:30:35,490
You think?

1234
01:30:44,760 --> 01:30:46,363
Why do we hold
public servants to a...

1235
01:30:46,439 --> 01:30:50,444
to a higher standard when it
comes to marriage and fidelity?

1236
01:30:50,520 --> 01:30:53,171
We're flawed like everyone else.

1237
01:30:56,199 --> 01:30:59,521
I set out to help people.

1238
01:30:59,640 --> 01:31:02,291
I never said
I was better than them.

1239
01:31:08,479 --> 01:31:10,686
Go talk to your wife.

1240
01:31:20,840 --> 01:31:22,887
Jeannie, we need to talk.

1241
01:31:28,760 --> 01:31:30,000
It's over.

1242
01:31:30,680 --> 01:31:32,841
I'm gonna resign tomorrow.

1243
01:31:35,520 --> 01:31:37,841
What? Why?

1244
01:31:39,159 --> 01:31:41,162
Coaker knows.

1245
01:31:42,159 --> 01:31:43,524
Knows what?

1246
01:31:46,079 --> 01:31:48,890
Come on, Jeannie.
You already know.

1247
01:31:49,840 --> 01:31:52,081
What is it
I'm supposed to know?

1248
01:31:54,359 --> 01:31:56,328
You want me to say it?

1249
01:32:04,680 --> 01:32:07,649
For the past few months...

1250
01:32:07,720 --> 01:32:11,280
I've been a client
of an escort agency.

1251
01:32:14,960 --> 01:32:16,564
"Been a client?"

1252
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:24,162
How would you
want me to say it?

1253
01:32:27,880 --> 01:32:30,280
You make it sound so clean.

1254
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:35,606
I have been so afraid
that somebody

1255
01:32:35,680 --> 01:32:38,286
would find out
that now I feel I...

1256
01:32:40,239 --> 01:32:41,400
I don't know.
I feel relieved.

1257
01:32:41,479 --> 01:32:43,323
I know that sounds horrible.

1258
01:32:45,199 --> 01:32:48,248
When this blows over,
I'll get a job on the civil side.

1259
01:32:48,319 --> 01:32:51,163
Something with less hours
and more money

1260
01:32:51,239 --> 01:32:55,039
so I can spend more time
with you and James.

1261
01:32:55,119 --> 01:32:56,724
Maybe you can go back
to practicing law,

1262
01:32:56,880 --> 01:32:58,369
if that's something
that you wanted.

1263
01:33:00,560 --> 01:33:03,324
Jeannie, I need your help.
I'm splitting apart here.

1264
01:33:03,399 --> 01:33:05,606
I can't imagine...
Just shut up!

1265
01:33:10,640 --> 01:33:13,644
What are we talking about here?

1266
01:33:13,720 --> 01:33:15,961
How many other girls
did you fuck?

1267
01:33:16,600 --> 01:33:18,886
Five, ten?
I mean, you can tell me.

1268
01:33:18,960 --> 01:33:22,567
Do you not think the wife
has a right to know?

1269
01:33:24,159 --> 01:33:25,685
What was it like with them?

1270
01:33:25,760 --> 01:33:27,000
I don't know, Jeannie.

1271
01:33:27,119 --> 01:33:27,962
You don't know?

1272
01:33:28,079 --> 01:33:30,650
Why didn't you just
have an affair, Sam?

1273
01:33:30,720 --> 01:33:34,007
That was my worst fear all along.

1274
01:33:34,079 --> 01:33:37,162
But that... that would've
made you human.

1275
01:33:38,199 --> 01:33:42,329
This makes you sick that
you view women that way.

1276
01:33:42,399 --> 01:33:44,003
And there isn't one person
I can blame,

1277
01:33:44,079 --> 01:33:45,844
Not one bitch
I can point the finger at.

1278
01:33:45,920 --> 01:33:48,650
You didn't even give me that!
Sorry.

1279
01:33:48,720 --> 01:33:50,323
If life with us
was so fucking terrible,

1280
01:33:50,399 --> 01:33:52,003
why didn't you just fucking go?

1281
01:33:52,079 --> 01:33:53,764
I didn't want that.
I never wanted that.

1282
01:33:53,840 --> 01:33:56,411
Then what, Sam?
Help me understand.

1283
01:33:56,479 --> 01:34:00,564
Was our routine so stifling?
Was that it?

1284
01:34:00,640 --> 01:34:02,404
Was it your crazy mama
who wanted you to be

1285
01:34:02,479 --> 01:34:04,288
the next Kennedy?
Was it me? Was it my dad?

1286
01:34:04,359 --> 01:34:06,680
I know he talks down to you,
but he put a roof over our heads.

1287
01:34:06,760 --> 01:34:08,409
He started your political career.
Okay.

1288
01:34:08,479 --> 01:34:09,925
Thank you.
Thanks for reminding me.

1289
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:12,320
You know, I felt suffocated,
too, but you know what I did?

1290
01:34:12,399 --> 01:34:16,041
I started a fucking vegetable garden.
But you...

1291
01:34:16,119 --> 01:34:17,724
You couldn't even
talk to one journalist

1292
01:34:17,800 --> 01:34:21,565
without destroying everything we worked for.
No, he already knew, Jeannie. He already knew.

1293
01:34:21,640 --> 01:34:23,880
You think you can do any better?
I'd like to see you try.

1294
01:34:23,920 --> 01:34:27,002
Riding me is not the same
as doing it yourself.

1295
01:34:27,079 --> 01:34:28,319
Coaker never liked me.

1296
01:34:28,399 --> 01:34:30,083
He was doing this
for you and your father.

1297
01:34:30,159 --> 01:34:31,365
So it's my fault now?

1298
01:34:31,439 --> 01:34:33,043
So, we should all
feel sorry for you?

1299
01:34:33,119 --> 01:34:34,929
I never asked anybody
to feel sorry for me.

1300
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:39,528
Please tell me it was worth it
for that few minutes of excitement.

1301
01:34:39,600 --> 01:34:42,206
Or is that why you did it?

1302
01:34:43,479 --> 01:34:45,720
So you could have a secret from me.

1303
01:34:45,800 --> 01:34:47,289
From everyone who believed in you.

1304
01:34:47,359 --> 01:34:49,408
Well, at least it was mine.

1305
01:35:19,119 --> 01:35:21,520
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

1306
01:35:21,600 --> 01:35:22,930
It's okay, buddy.

1307
01:35:44,079 --> 01:35:46,480
I suppose you'd like to come in.

1308
01:36:02,520 --> 01:36:04,045
How'd you find out?

1309
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:08,243
Just because I'm old
doesn't mean I'm lazy.

1310
01:36:15,319 --> 01:36:16,650
Here you go.

1311
01:36:21,520 --> 01:36:22,645
That a girl.

1312
01:36:23,560 --> 01:36:25,323
Don't write the piece.

1313
01:36:42,520 --> 01:36:44,886
It's a matter of time
before he brings himself down.

1314
01:36:44,960 --> 01:36:46,689
That doesn't mean
you have to humiliate me

1315
01:36:46,760 --> 01:36:48,682
in front of the entire world,
in front of my son.

1316
01:36:48,760 --> 01:36:51,001
If it's not me, it'll be
someone else eventually.

1317
01:36:51,079 --> 01:36:52,127
Let it be somebody else.

1318
01:36:52,239 --> 01:36:54,287
Why the fuck should I?
'Cause I'm asking you to.

1319
01:36:54,359 --> 01:36:56,761
I didn't want to write the piece
in the first place.

1320
01:36:56,840 --> 01:36:59,570
Now it's getting interesting,
and you want me to stop?

1321
01:36:59,640 --> 01:37:03,007
Look, I realize it's your job,
but is it worth destroying my family

1322
01:37:03,079 --> 01:37:04,524
to sell a few fucking magazines?

1323
01:37:04,600 --> 01:37:07,524
I didn't break the law.

1324
01:37:07,600 --> 01:37:09,761
Whereas you, my dear,
now, you just found out

1325
01:37:09,840 --> 01:37:11,967
your husband's
fucking prostitutes.

1326
01:37:12,039 --> 01:37:13,371
Now all you can do
is defend him?

1327
01:37:13,439 --> 01:37:16,444
How many students did you fuck in
exchange for better grades? Oh, oh, okay.

1328
01:37:16,520 --> 01:37:18,203
I mean, is it really any different?

1329
01:37:18,319 --> 01:37:20,287
This ain't about me, right?

1330
01:37:21,840 --> 01:37:25,765
This is about you protecting
your ticket to the top.

1331
01:37:25,840 --> 01:37:28,445
I mean, that's all
you really care about.

1332
01:37:28,520 --> 01:37:30,841
I don't think you're really
bothered about any of them

1333
01:37:30,920 --> 01:37:32,921
other women, I mean,
'cause you're just like him.

1334
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:34,922
I mean, what does he do?
Does he pull your hair?

1335
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:36,649
Does he talk filth to you?

1336
01:37:36,720 --> 01:37:39,849
Or are you content
to allow his young whores

1337
01:37:39,920 --> 01:37:41,649
to do as they will with him?

1338
01:37:41,720 --> 01:37:44,609
Just as long as you can
sit on that fucking throne.

1339
01:37:50,880 --> 01:37:52,041
Oh.

1340
01:37:53,079 --> 01:37:55,320
You're your father's girl, yeah?

1341
01:37:55,399 --> 01:37:57,448
Now I know I'm digging
in the right place.

1342
01:37:57,520 --> 01:37:58,645
Fuck you.

1343
01:37:58,720 --> 01:38:00,164
Anytime, Jeannie.

1344
01:38:02,159 --> 01:38:03,524
Since you were 16.

1345
01:38:03,600 --> 01:38:05,363
Any fucking time.

1346
01:38:08,279 --> 01:38:09,610
Okay.

1347
01:38:11,359 --> 01:38:13,761
I beg your pardon?

1348
01:38:13,840 --> 01:38:15,682
Call it an even trade.

1349
01:38:17,479 --> 01:38:18,402
What?

1350
01:38:18,479 --> 01:38:20,208
We both know
you haven't been staring at me

1351
01:38:20,279 --> 01:38:24,489
since I was 16, Nigel.
More like 13.

1352
01:38:24,560 --> 01:38:26,766
I'm still the same girl, so...

1353
01:38:29,039 --> 01:38:31,327
Come on, what do you say?

1354
01:39:21,640 --> 01:39:23,961
Coaker's not gonna run the story.

1355
01:39:32,079 --> 01:39:34,082
What did you do?

1356
01:39:34,159 --> 01:39:37,481
Remember everything
we talked about?

1357
01:39:37,560 --> 01:39:39,368
Remember all the goals
we set for ourselves?

1358
01:39:39,439 --> 01:39:41,168
Let's not throw that away.

1359
01:39:45,279 --> 01:39:47,760
But what if I can't do it anymore?

1360
01:39:49,199 --> 01:39:51,520
Bit late for that,
don't you think?

1361
01:40:01,199 --> 01:40:03,440
I didn't think
you had it in you.

1362
01:40:06,079 --> 01:40:07,844
Go to hell, Sam.

1363
01:40:17,399 --> 01:40:21,449
Just let me ask you one thing.

1364
01:40:21,520 --> 01:40:23,841
What did they have that I don't?

1365
01:40:28,640 --> 01:40:29,845
Nothing.

1366
01:40:43,079 --> 01:40:44,969
Sir, you wanted to see me?

1367
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:47,444
Have a seat.

1368
01:40:54,720 --> 01:40:57,404
I know the FBI
asked you about me, Sam.

1369
01:40:57,479 --> 01:40:59,641
I'm sorry about that whole mess.

1370
01:40:59,720 --> 01:41:01,847
They were just grasping at straws.

1371
01:41:01,920 --> 01:41:03,524
Shouldn't have happened.

1372
01:41:06,119 --> 01:41:11,762
Listen, I know you're gonna
go after Pollan's seat.

1373
01:41:11,840 --> 01:41:13,921
Well, I haven't officially
decided anything yet.

1374
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:19,086
Just wanted you to know
that I'm all for it.

1375
01:41:19,159 --> 01:41:21,845
We need guys like you in D.C.

1376
01:41:21,920 --> 01:41:24,127
Still see things clearly.

1377
01:41:25,479 --> 01:41:30,520
You been at it as long as I have,
everything looks grey and murky.

1378
01:41:32,479 --> 01:41:34,083
Thank you, sir.

1379
01:41:41,680 --> 01:41:43,091
Fucking "A."

1380
01:41:44,920 --> 01:41:46,444
Look at that.

1381
01:41:54,399 --> 01:41:56,686
<i>Wow.
Hmm.</i>

1382
01:41:56,760 --> 01:41:58,887
Better than
we could've imagined.

1383
01:42:20,359 --> 01:42:22,010
<i>Senator?</i>

1384
01:42:24,680 --> 01:42:26,408
Senator?

1385
01:42:26,479 --> 01:42:27,402
Your wife just called.

1386
01:42:27,479 --> 01:42:29,403
She won't be able
to make it on Tuesday,

1387
01:42:29,479 --> 01:42:32,051
but she'll be coming down for the
Governor's Ball on Saturday.

1388
01:42:32,119 --> 01:42:33,689
All right, that's fine.

1389
01:42:33,760 --> 01:42:36,001
Just make sure she has
a pick up at the airport.

1390
01:42:36,079 --> 01:42:37,206
Yes, sir.

1391
01:42:37,279 --> 01:42:38,645
Do you want us
to come in with you?

1392
01:42:38,720 --> 01:42:39,960
No.

1393
01:42:40,039 --> 01:42:42,850
We have some
private business to discuss.

1394
01:42:42,920 --> 01:42:45,207
You go have lunch. I'll call
you when we're finished.

1395
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:55,331
Senator.

1396
01:42:55,399 --> 01:42:56,605
George.

1397
01:43:00,279 --> 01:43:02,487
Good to see you.

1398
01:43:02,560 --> 01:43:03,606
Coffee?

1399
01:43:03,680 --> 01:43:05,569
No. Kicked the habit.

1400
01:43:05,640 --> 01:43:08,882
Everything
in moderation, huh?

1401
01:43:08,960 --> 01:43:10,609
That's right.

1402
01:43:10,680 --> 01:43:12,728
How's the family?
Your son doing all right?

1403
01:43:12,800 --> 01:43:15,167
Can't run him
for congress till he's 25.

1404
01:43:16,479 --> 01:43:17,479
Well, we'll see.

1405
01:43:18,680 --> 01:43:20,283
So, you liking it up here?

1406
01:43:20,399 --> 01:43:22,368
Well, Jeannie
doesn't love it,

1407
01:43:22,439 --> 01:43:25,329
but her charity
keeps her at home mostly.

1408
01:43:25,399 --> 01:43:28,164
I like D.C.
It suits me.

1409
01:43:28,239 --> 01:43:29,729
Good.

1410
01:43:29,800 --> 01:43:31,722
'Cause you might be here
for a long time

1411
01:43:31,800 --> 01:43:33,244
if I have anything
to say about it.

1412
01:43:34,439 --> 01:43:37,523
Reelection campaign headquarters
are opening up next week,

1413
01:43:37,600 --> 01:43:39,886
and I talked to the governor
this morning.

1414
01:43:39,960 --> 01:43:42,565
You can expect
a formal endorsement.

1415
01:43:42,640 --> 01:43:44,085
Glad to hear it.

1416
01:43:44,159 --> 01:43:47,561
Sam, I do want
to talk to you, though,

1417
01:43:47,640 --> 01:43:49,563
about your...

1418
01:43:49,640 --> 01:43:51,721
your zipper problem.

1419
01:43:54,520 --> 01:43:57,682
Now, it doesn't surprise me.

1420
01:43:57,760 --> 01:44:02,926
And I don't really care
what you do in your spare time.

1421
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:05,570
But the day
you signed on for this,

1422
01:44:05,640 --> 01:44:10,407
you put your life on probation.

1423
01:44:10,479 --> 01:44:14,451
Your time on this planet
as a human being

1424
01:44:14,520 --> 01:44:19,810
who eats and shits
and fucks like the rest of us,

1425
01:44:19,880 --> 01:44:21,769
that's over.

1426
01:44:21,840 --> 01:44:26,288
You got a patriotic duty
to be squeaky clean

1427
01:44:26,359 --> 01:44:30,001
for these people who would
turn on you on a dime,

1428
01:44:30,079 --> 01:44:32,765
and that is the contract.

1429
01:44:34,600 --> 01:44:38,570
There may be some people
who want the truth...

1430
01:44:38,640 --> 01:44:41,529
in a courtroom.

1431
01:44:41,600 --> 01:44:43,328
But outside,

1432
01:44:43,399 --> 01:44:48,690
they want to believe that you're
somehow better than they are.

1433
01:44:48,800 --> 01:44:51,167
They need that fairytale.

1434
01:44:51,239 --> 01:44:54,368
It's the only thing that
society has to keep it

1435
01:44:54,439 --> 01:44:59,047
from sinking into the muck.

1436
01:44:59,119 --> 01:45:03,283
That and wise policy.

1437
01:45:05,439 --> 01:45:07,488
It's under control.

1438
01:45:07,560 --> 01:45:10,039
That's all behind me now.

1439
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:14,402
Well, that's...
that's all I wanted to hear.

1440
01:45:14,479 --> 01:45:19,167
I suppose that
if we ruled out every candidate

1441
01:45:19,239 --> 01:45:21,970
who ever stepped out
on his wife,

1442
01:45:22,039 --> 01:45:25,088
it'd be just pussy-whipped nerds
running the country.

1443
01:45:26,279 --> 01:45:28,009
We don't want that, do we?

1444
01:45:30,359 --> 01:45:32,930
People still need heroes.

1445
01:45:34,520 --> 01:45:36,045
Let's give them one.

1446
01:45:36,119 --> 01:45:37,405
Good.

1447
01:45:39,119 --> 01:45:42,841
Now, here's the first round
of donations from our friends

1448
01:45:42,920 --> 01:45:44,842
and that's just the beginning.

1449
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:53,320
And, Sam,

1450
01:45:53,399 --> 01:45:57,802
I wouldn't spend a lot of time
on ethics reform right now.

1451
01:45:57,880 --> 01:46:01,327
You don't want to make
a lot of promises on that.

1452
01:46:01,399 --> 01:46:03,720
And besides, you got
a lot of other subjects

1453
01:46:03,800 --> 01:46:06,279
that you can tackle first.

1454
01:46:06,359 --> 01:46:07,930
Well, I don't know
about you, George,

1455
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:09,524
but I can handle
two things at once.

1456
01:46:11,279 --> 01:46:14,328
You are a quick study, Ellis.

1457
01:46:14,399 --> 01:46:15,605
You'll do all right.

1
00:01:33,082 --> 00:01:41,500


2
00:01:49,167 --> 00:01:53,167
Here Lies Dobby

3
00:02:25,082 --> 00:02:25,832
It's beautiful here.

4
00:02:28,125 --> 00:02:31,207
It was our house.
We used to come here when we were kids.

5
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:34,250
We only use it as safe-house.

6
00:02:36,417 --> 00:02:37,625
What's left from us, at least.

7
00:02:40,292 --> 00:02:42,125
My uncles thought these
things keeps evil away.

8
00:02:42,875 --> 00:02:44,167
But they were wrong.

9
00:02:47,042 --> 00:02:48,082
I need to talk to goblin.

10
00:03:00,082 --> 00:03:01,250
How are you?

11
00:03:21,042 --> 00:03:23,667
- You buried the elf?
- Yes.

12
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,500
It brought me here.

13
00:03:28,167 --> 00:03:29,082
You are...

14
00:03:30,917 --> 00:03:33,042
Pretty unusal, is it?

15
00:03:40,417 --> 00:03:42,000
How did you come by the sword?

16
00:03:46,792 --> 00:03:48,375
It's complicated.

17
00:03:50,457 --> 00:03:53,457
What about Bellatrix Lestrange thing
that should be in his vault at Gringotts?

18
00:03:54,792 --> 00:03:56,457
It's complicated.

19
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:03,667
The sword presented itself to us,
in when to need.

20
00:04:04,332 --> 00:04:05,082
We didn't steal it.

21
00:04:08,417 --> 00:04:11,667
There is a sword in madam Lestrange's vault.
I think it's identical to this one.

22
00:04:11,667 --> 00:04:13,042
But it is a fake.

23
00:04:13,917 --> 00:04:15,457
It was placed there this past summer.

24
00:04:15,457 --> 00:04:16,957
Actually, never suspected it was a fake.

25
00:04:17,082 --> 00:04:18,750
That because replicate is very convincing.

26
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:22,082
Only a goblin who can recognize that this is the true Sword of Gryffindor.

27
00:04:22,582 --> 00:04:23,582
Who is thier acquaintance?

28
00:04:24,332 --> 00:04:25,582
Hogwart Professor.

29
00:04:26,625 --> 00:04:28,582
As I understand that he's now headmaster.

30
00:04:29,292 --> 00:04:30,582
Snape.

31
00:04:31,292 --> 00:04:33,667
If there was a fake sword in madam Lestrange's vault..

32
00:04:34,917 --> 00:04:35,667
Why?

33
00:04:35,667 --> 00:04:39,417
There are more than of a few
curious in vaults of Gringotts.

34
00:04:40,792 --> 00:04:43,332
And in madam Lestrange's vault as well?

35
00:04:46,667 --> 00:04:47,417
Perhaps.

36
00:04:49,625 --> 00:04:52,957
I need to get into Gringotts.
Into one of the vaults.

37
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,667
- It's impossible.
- Alone, yes.

38
00:04:56,667 --> 00:04:58,250
But with you, no.

39
00:05:03,708 --> 00:05:06,458
- Why should I help you?
- I have gold.

40
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:08,166
Lots of it.

41
00:05:08,166 --> 00:05:09,583
I've no interest in gold.

42
00:05:09,958 --> 00:05:11,125
And what?

43
00:05:16,125 --> 00:05:16,957
That.

44
00:05:18,082 --> 00:05:19,542
That is my price.

45
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:35,000
Are you thinking that sword we spoke
about in madam Lestrange's vault?

46
00:05:35,582 --> 00:05:37,417
Well, she was terrified when she went in there.

47
00:05:37,875 --> 00:05:39,957
She keeped asking me,
what else was taken?

48
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:42,792
I  bet you antything, thats Horcrux in there.
Another piece of his soul.

49
00:05:42,957 --> 00:05:45,875
Let's find it, and kill it, and we will
once that closer to killing him.

50
00:05:46,167 --> 00:05:46,832
And once we find him,

51
00:05:48,042 --> 00:05:50,000
how we supposed to destroy it, if you gave the sword to Gringotts?

52
00:05:51,625 --> 00:05:52,750
I'm still working on that part.

53
00:05:55,167 --> 00:05:56,582
He's weak.

54
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:06,791
Harry!

55
00:06:08,875 --> 00:06:09,750
Mr. Ollivander..

56
00:06:11,125 --> 00:06:12,833
I need to ask you a few questions.

57
00:06:13,291 --> 00:06:14,750
Anything, my boy.
Anything!

58
00:06:16,707 --> 00:06:21,000
Would you mind identifying this wand?
We need to know if it's safe to use.

59
00:06:27,167 --> 00:06:29,042
Uhh... walnut

60
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,667
Dargon Heart String.

61
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:35,000
12.75 inches.

62
00:06:36,625 --> 00:06:38,207
Unyie...

63
00:06:40,167 --> 00:06:41,625
Unyielding.

64
00:06:43,542 --> 00:06:46,875
This belong to Bellatrix Lestrange.

65
00:06:47,625 --> 00:06:49,207
Treat it carefuly.

66
00:06:50,832 --> 00:06:51,750
And this?

67
00:06:55,292 --> 00:06:56,417
Hawthorn.

68
00:06:58,457 --> 00:07:00,208
An unicorn hair.

69
00:07:00,833 --> 00:07:02,250
10 inches.

70
00:07:03,083 --> 00:07:04,666
Reasonably pliant.

71
00:07:08,541 --> 00:07:12,250
This was the one of Draco Malfoy.

72
00:07:13,958 --> 00:07:15,375
Was?

73
00:07:15,375 --> 00:07:16,625
Is it not still?

74
00:07:16,625 --> 00:07:19,417
Well, perhaps not.
If you want it from him.

75
00:07:22,832 --> 00:07:24,957
I sense its allegiance has changed.

76
00:07:30,792 --> 00:07:34,832
You talk about wands,
as if they have feelings...

77
00:07:37,332 --> 00:07:38,000
can think!

78
00:07:41,917 --> 00:07:45,167
The wand chooses the wizard, Mr. Potter.

79
00:07:46,457 --> 00:07:51,000
That matter has always been clear to
those of us who've studied the wand-lore.

80
00:07:52,917 --> 00:07:55,375
And, what do you know about the deathly hallows?

81
00:08:00,708 --> 00:08:02,625
It's rumored there are three.

82
00:08:05,333 --> 00:08:12,625
The elder wand, the cloak of invisibility,
that hide you from your enemies..

83
00:08:13,458 --> 00:08:18,250
and the resurection stone, to bring
back your love ones from the dead.

84
00:08:18,957 --> 00:08:23,125
Together, they make one the Master of Death.

85
00:08:24,207 --> 00:08:29,957
But, few truly believe that such objects exist.

86
00:08:29,957 --> 00:08:30,750
Do you?

87
00:08:32,167 --> 00:08:34,250
Do you believe they exist, sir?

88
00:08:35,875 --> 00:08:37,082
Well..

89
00:08:37,417 --> 00:08:43,042
I see no reasons to put
stock into an old wives' tale.

90
00:08:44,082 --> 00:08:44,832
You're lying!

91
00:08:46,582 --> 00:08:48,167
You know once exists.

92
00:08:49,125 --> 00:08:53,292
You told him about it.
You told him about the elder wand...

93
00:08:53,292 --> 00:08:55,750
and way to go looking for it.

94
00:08:59,292 --> 00:09:00,582
He tortured me.

95
00:09:03,957 --> 00:09:05,167
Besides...

96
00:09:06,542 --> 00:09:08,457
only convey rumors.

97
00:09:11,082 --> 00:09:11,582
This...

98
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,167
This not telling how will he find it.

99
00:09:19,667 --> 00:09:20,917
He has found it, sir.

100
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,207
We'll let you rest.

101
00:09:31,207 --> 00:09:33,332
He's after you, Mr. Potter.

102
00:09:34,332 --> 00:09:36,500
If it's true what you say,

103
00:09:37,082 --> 00:09:38,625
and he has the elder wand,

104
00:09:41,625 --> 00:09:42,542
I'm afraid,

105
00:09:43,667 --> 00:09:46,207
you really don't stand a chance.

106
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,750
I supposed to kill him, before he finds me, then.

107
00:09:56,125 --> 00:09:57,542
You sure that's hers?

108
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:00,457
Positive.

109
00:10:07,125 --> 00:10:08,582
Well?

110
00:10:09,542 --> 00:10:10,875
How do I look?

111
00:10:11,875 --> 00:10:13,417
Hideous.

112
00:10:14,457 --> 00:10:16,750
You can give that to Hermione to hold.
Alright, Gryphook?

113
00:10:36,375 --> 00:10:37,500
We're relying on you, Gryphook.

114
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,832
If you get us pass the guards into the vault...

115
00:10:39,832 --> 00:10:40,957
The sword is yours.

116
00:10:53,417 --> 00:10:54,417
Madam Lestrange.

117
00:10:54,417 --> 00:10:55,500
Good morning.

118
00:10:57,792 --> 00:11:00,582
Good morning?
Good morning?!

119
00:11:01,207 --> 00:11:04,167
You'd better drip more of Lestrange,
not a school girl!

120
00:11:04,167 --> 00:11:05,417
Hey!
Easy!

121
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:10,500
If she gives us away, we must swear
to use that sword to slit her own throat.

122
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:11,917
Understand?

123
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:13,417
No, he's right.

124
00:11:14,292 --> 00:11:15,375
I spoke stupid.

125
00:11:16,125 --> 00:11:18,582
Okay.
Let's do it.

126
00:12:21,832 --> 00:12:23,875
I wish to enter my vault.

127
00:12:27,417 --> 00:12:29,167
Identification?

128
00:12:32,332 --> 00:12:34,667
I hardly think that would be necessary.

129
00:12:37,125 --> 00:12:38,875
Madam Lestrange.

130
00:12:43,917 --> 00:12:46,082
I don't like to be kept wating.

131
00:12:46,707 --> 00:12:48,082
[Ron mentaly thinks]:
I know..

132
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:49,875
<i>I know she's being impostor.</i>

133
00:12:53,042 --> 00:12:54,832
<i>I'll get my wand.</i>

134
00:13:02,832 --> 00:13:03,625
Harry..

135
00:13:05,125 --> 00:13:05,832
What do we do, Harry?

136
00:13:11,917 --> 00:13:15,707
Madam Lestrange,
would you mind presenting your wand?

137
00:13:16,875 --> 00:13:18,167
And why should I do that?

138
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:23,457
It's the bank's policy!
I'm sure you understand, given current conditions.

139
00:13:23,957 --> 00:13:26,707
No! I most does really not understand!

140
00:13:26,707 --> 00:13:29,917
I'm afraid, I must insist.

141
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:37,000
Hereuia!

142
00:13:42,917 --> 00:13:44,542
Very well, madam Lestrange.

143
00:13:45,082 --> 00:13:46,250
If you would follow me?

144
00:14:21,375 --> 00:14:22,500
What is that, Gryphook?

145
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,000
Gryphook?!

146
00:14:52,542 --> 00:14:54,542
Well done, Hermione.

147
00:15:02,832 --> 00:15:04,167
Oh, my!
You two like you, again.

148
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:08,125
Thetys downfall washes
away all enchantment.

149
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:09,667
Can be deadly.

150
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:10,707
Get outside.

151
00:15:11,582 --> 00:15:14,042
Just out of interest,
is there any other way out of here?

152
00:15:14,625 --> 00:15:15,832
No.

153
00:15:17,207 --> 00:15:20,207
What the devil are all you doing down here?

154
00:15:20,917 --> 00:15:22,375
Thiefs!

155
00:15:22,375 --> 00:15:23,625
You gave up of your...

156
00:15:34,625 --> 00:15:36,332
That doesn't sound good.

157
00:15:47,125 --> 00:15:48,332
Bloody hell!

158
00:15:48,332 --> 00:15:50,042
That seems cranky ogre.

159
00:15:50,042 --> 00:15:51,417
Here.

160
00:16:02,332 --> 00:16:04,582
It's been trained to expect pain
when it hears this noise.

161
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:06,582
That's barbaric!

162
00:16:35,167 --> 00:16:36,457
Blemous.

163
00:16:41,042 --> 00:16:41,917
It's bloody.

164
00:16:49,417 --> 00:16:50,792
Accio horcrux!

165
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:54,875
You seems you're gonna try
this here, won't you?

166
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:56,707
That kind of magic won't work here.

167
00:17:01,625 --> 00:17:02,707
It's in here, Harry.

168
00:17:04,541 --> 00:17:05,333
Can you feel it?

169
00:17:26,375 --> 00:17:28,708
That's it!
Up there!

170
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:35,541
They had an enchantment here.
Everything you touch will multiply.

171
00:17:35,833 --> 00:17:36,458
Give me the sword.

172
00:17:54,416 --> 00:17:55,791
Stop moving!

173
00:18:17,541 --> 00:18:18,125
Do it!

174
00:18:21,083 --> 00:18:23,708
- We had deal, Gryphook!
- The cup for the sowrd!

175
00:18:30,041 --> 00:18:33,958
I said I'm gonna get into it,
but I didn't say anything about getting you out.

176
00:18:55,625 --> 00:18:58,041
Gryphook! Please!
Gryphook!

177
00:18:58,041 --> 00:18:58,916
Hey, beast!

178
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:03,875
If I would get it,

179
00:19:03,875 --> 00:19:05,625
this is Cyrco Bogglor.

180
00:19:12,333 --> 00:19:13,666
That's unfortunate.

181
00:19:17,791 --> 00:19:20,208
We can't just stand here,
not to move right here.

182
00:19:20,208 --> 00:19:21,166
Should be a brilliant one.

183
00:19:21,958 --> 00:19:23,666
I've got something,
but it's mad!

184
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:25,500
Reducto!

185
00:19:37,541 --> 00:19:38,791
Well, come on, then!

186
00:19:41,208 --> 00:19:42,500
Relashio!

187
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:28,875
Keep moving!

188
00:20:55,208 --> 00:20:55,916
Now what?

189
00:20:55,916 --> 00:20:57,541
Reganta!

190
00:20:59,125 --> 00:20:59,750
Hold on.

191
00:21:09,833 --> 00:21:12,500
That was brilliant!
Absolutely brilliant!

192
00:21:40,041 --> 00:21:41,375
We're dropping!

193
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:46,250
- I say we jump!
- When?

194
00:21:46,666 --> 00:21:47,250
Now!

195
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:40,750
He knows.

196
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:42,250
'You know who'.

197
00:22:43,166 --> 00:22:44,750
He knows we've broke into Gringotts.

198
00:22:44,791 --> 00:22:47,541
He knows what we took,
and he knows we're hunting Horcruxs.

199
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:49,541
- How is he know?
- I showed him.

200
00:22:50,291 --> 00:22:52,708
You let him in?
Harry, you can't do that!

201
00:22:52,708 --> 00:22:54,250
Hermione, I can't always help it!

202
00:22:54,583 --> 00:22:55,916
Well, maybe I can.
I don't know!

203
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:57,500
Never mind!
What happened?

204
00:22:57,833 --> 00:22:59,333
Well, he's angry...

205
00:22:59,875 --> 00:23:01,083
and scared too.

206
00:23:01,416 --> 00:23:04,416
He knows, if we find and destroyed
all the Horcruxes, we'll be able to kill him.

207
00:23:04,916 --> 00:23:07,666
He'll try all the ways and will let nothing
to make sure we don't find the rest.

208
00:23:09,666 --> 00:23:10,583
And there's more.

209
00:23:10,583 --> 00:23:11,625
More of it at Hogwarts.

210
00:23:11,875 --> 00:23:12,666
What?

211
00:23:13,625 --> 00:23:14,375
You saw it?

212
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:15,375
I saw the castle.

213
00:23:15,375 --> 00:23:16,625
And under of the Raiven Klue.

214
00:23:16,625 --> 00:23:17,750
It must have something to do with her.

215
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:19,083
We have to go there, now!

216
00:23:19,083 --> 00:23:20,208
Well, we can't do that!

217
00:23:20,916 --> 00:23:22,666
We've got to plan,
we've got to figure it out!

218
00:23:22,666 --> 00:23:25,291
Hermione, when have any of
our plans ever actually worked?

219
00:23:25,791 --> 00:23:27,750
We plan, we get there,
all hell breaks loose.

220
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,041
He's right!
One problem..

221
00:23:31,666 --> 00:23:34,375
Snape is headmaster now,
we can't just go from the front door!

222
00:23:35,666 --> 00:23:38,125
Well, we'll go to Hogsmeade,

223
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:39,291
to Hadteod.

224
00:23:39,291 --> 00:23:40,875
Take the secret passage into cellar.

225
00:23:41,583 --> 00:23:42,291
It's..

226
00:23:42,666 --> 00:23:44,125
There's something wrong with him.

227
00:23:45,083 --> 00:23:45,750
It's like, you know,

228
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:46,458
in the past..

229
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:48,916
I've always been able
to follow his thoughts.

230
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:51,208
And now everything just feels disconnected.

231
00:23:51,958 --> 00:23:54,750
Maybe it's the Horcruxes.
Maybe he's getting weaker.

232
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:55,416
Maybe he's dying!

233
00:23:55,416 --> 00:23:56,250
No!

234
00:23:56,666 --> 00:23:58,416
No, it's more like he's wounded.

235
00:23:58,875 --> 00:24:00,583
If had a thing he feels more dangerous.

236
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:51,000
- Right here. Come on!
- Search everywhere.

237
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,250
Go, move!

238
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:12,041
Faster!

239
00:25:23,916 --> 00:25:25,416
In here, Potter.

240
00:25:30,166 --> 00:25:31,250
<i>Come on, move!</i>

241
00:25:38,375 --> 00:25:40,208
She can't look at him.

242
00:25:40,625 --> 00:25:43,333
- For second we were close.
- I know. Dumbledore!

243
00:25:58,916 --> 00:26:00,125
Harry?

244
00:26:02,208 --> 00:26:03,666
Why I do see you in this?

245
00:26:17,125 --> 00:26:19,708
Bloody fools, what did you think in coming here?

246
00:26:19,708 --> 00:26:22,291
Have you any idea how dangerous it is?

247
00:26:22,291 --> 00:26:24,833
You're Aberforth, Dumbledore's brother.

248
00:26:26,166 --> 00:26:27,875
It's you who I've been seeing in here.

249
00:26:28,666 --> 00:26:29,916
You're the one who sent Dobby.

250
00:26:30,416 --> 00:26:32,708
- Why've you left him?
- He's dead.

251
00:26:33,583 --> 00:26:35,791
Sorry to hear it.
I liked that elf.

252
00:26:35,833 --> 00:26:37,041
Who gave that to you?

253
00:26:37,416 --> 00:26:38,083
The mirror?

254
00:26:39,416 --> 00:26:41,625
The Dungs' Fletcher, about a year ago.

255
00:26:41,791 --> 00:26:43,333
Dung had no right sending that to you.
It belongs..

256
00:26:43,333 --> 00:26:43,958
Sirius...

257
00:26:45,291 --> 00:26:47,000
Albus told me.

258
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:50,791
he also told me you'd likely be act off,

259
00:26:50,791 --> 00:26:52,916
if you ever found that I had it.
But, ask yourself;

260
00:26:53,708 --> 00:26:55,375
Where would you be if I didn't?

261
00:26:59,458 --> 00:27:01,041
To you have any others much?

262
00:27:01,041 --> 00:27:01,750
From the Order?

263
00:27:02,458 --> 00:27:03,750
The Order has finished.

264
00:27:04,166 --> 00:27:05,583
'You know who' has won,

265
00:27:05,958 --> 00:27:09,166
anyone who says, otherwise he's killing themselves.

266
00:27:09,166 --> 00:27:11,583
We need to get into Hogwarts, tonight.

267
00:27:12,208 --> 00:27:13,458
Dumbledore gave us a job today.

268
00:27:13,833 --> 00:27:14,583
Did he knew..

269
00:27:15,416 --> 00:27:17,750
it's a nice job,
and easy.

270
00:27:18,458 --> 00:27:19,916
We've been hunting Horcruxes.

271
00:27:20,916 --> 00:27:23,291
We think the last one is inside the castle.

272
00:27:23,291 --> 00:27:24,458
But only with your help we can get in.

273
00:27:24,458 --> 00:27:28,291
What a job my brother has given you, it's a suicide mission.

274
00:27:28,291 --> 00:27:30,708
Do yourself a favior, boy.
Go home!

275
00:27:30,708 --> 00:27:31,833
You'll live a little bit longer.

276
00:27:31,833 --> 00:27:33,583
Dumbledore trusted me to see this through.

277
00:27:33,583 --> 00:27:35,083
What makes you think you can trust him?

278
00:27:36,375 --> 00:27:39,041
What makes you think you can
believe anything my brother told you?

279
00:27:39,041 --> 00:27:40,291
And in other time he's with you..

280
00:27:40,833 --> 00:27:42,291
did he ever mentioned my name?

281
00:27:43,708 --> 00:27:45,458
Did he ever mentioned hers?

282
00:27:46,041 --> 00:27:47,583
- Why should he...
- Keep secrets.

283
00:27:47,583 --> 00:27:48,708
You tell me?

284
00:27:50,291 --> 00:27:52,958
- I trusted him.
- That your boys answer.

285
00:27:54,083 --> 00:27:58,875
A boy goes chasing Horcruxes is on the wood alone.
A man who wouldn't even tell him where to start.

286
00:27:58,875 --> 00:27:59,791
You're lying!

287
00:28:00,416 --> 00:28:03,958
Not just on me, it doesn't matter.
To yourself as well.

288
00:28:04,208 --> 00:28:05,625
That's what a fool does.

289
00:28:05,916 --> 00:28:10,041
You don't strike me as a fool, Harry Potter!

290
00:28:10,333 --> 00:28:13,583
So, I ask you again, there must be a reason.

291
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:18,791
I'm not interested in what happened
between you and your brother.

292
00:28:20,458 --> 00:28:21,875
I don't care that you've given up.

293
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,541
I trusted the man I knew.

294
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:32,208
We need to get into the castle tonight.

295
00:28:38,541 --> 00:28:39,916
You know what to do.

296
00:28:47,041 --> 00:28:48,250
Where have you sent her?

297
00:28:49,416 --> 00:28:50,041
You'll see.

298
00:28:51,083 --> 00:28:52,333
Soon enough.

299
00:28:58,708 --> 00:29:00,500
That's your sister, Ariana.
Isn't it?

300
00:29:02,375 --> 00:29:04,083
She died for a young, didn't she?

301
00:29:05,916 --> 00:29:09,125
My brother sacrificed many things, Mr. Potter.

302
00:29:09,791 --> 00:29:11,541
On his journey to find power.

303
00:29:12,375 --> 00:29:13,583
Including Ariana.

304
00:29:14,875 --> 00:29:16,666
And she was devoted to him.

305
00:29:18,250 --> 00:29:19,583
He gave her everything.

306
00:29:21,166 --> 00:29:22,666
But time.

307
00:29:24,375 --> 00:29:25,791
Thank you, Mr. Dumbledore.

308
00:29:33,125 --> 00:29:34,750
He did save our lifes twice!

309
00:29:36,166 --> 00:29:37,583
Gave us his eyes on the mirror.

310
00:29:39,458 --> 00:29:41,416
That doesn't seem like someone who is giving up!

311
00:29:47,541 --> 00:29:49,000
She's coming back.

312
00:29:50,250 --> 00:29:51,458
What's that with her?

313
00:29:59,041 --> 00:30:00,291
Neville!

314
00:30:00,291 --> 00:30:02,333
- How did you come?
- Hi!

315
00:30:03,083 --> 00:30:03,625
This is nothing.

316
00:30:04,291 --> 00:30:05,250
Seamus is worse.

317
00:30:05,833 --> 00:30:06,333
Hey, Ab!

318
00:30:06,916 --> 00:30:08,375
With more peoples are coming through.

319
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,166
Don't remember that it was on the map.

320
00:30:12,166 --> 00:30:14,000
That's because it was never existed until now.

321
00:30:14,708 --> 00:30:17,250
The 7 secret passages were sealed off,
before the start of year.

322
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:19,083
This is the only way enter and out, now.

323
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,250
Grounded of death eaters and Dementors.

324
00:30:22,250 --> 00:30:23,875
How about what said about Snape the headmaster?

325
00:30:24,250 --> 00:30:24,958
I've never seen him.

326
00:30:25,291 --> 00:30:26,625
It's the Carrows who is watching 'em out for.

327
00:30:27,375 --> 00:30:28,125
The Carrows?

328
00:30:28,125 --> 00:30:30,541
Yeah. Brother and sister.
They're trying apply the discipline.

329
00:30:30,916 --> 00:30:32,750
They like punishment, the Carrows.

330
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:33,583
They did that to you?

331
00:30:33,833 --> 00:30:34,875
Why?

332
00:30:34,875 --> 00:30:37,833
Today's Dark Arts was telling to
practice on Cruciatus curse.

333
00:30:38,166 --> 00:30:39,291
On first years.

334
00:30:40,458 --> 00:30:41,208
I refused.

335
00:30:43,041 --> 00:30:44,166
Hogwarts changed.

336
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:58,708
Let's have a bit of fun, shall we?

337
00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:06,291
Hey, I've brought up..

338
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:07,791
for you a surprise.

339
00:31:07,791 --> 00:31:09,541
No more of Aberforth's cook's gonna help.

340
00:31:09,958 --> 00:31:11,500
We'll be surprised if you got us a desalination.

341
00:31:13,791 --> 00:31:16,583
- Oh my!
- Harry!

342
00:31:29,958 --> 00:31:32,041
Give up a news to Remus and
Spread that Harry is back.

343
00:31:32,833 --> 00:31:33,708
Okay, okay!

344
00:31:33,916 --> 00:31:35,541
Let's not kill him with this group huging.

345
00:31:35,541 --> 00:31:39,625
...do you read? we've a new weather report.
Lightning has chucked. I repeat: Lightning has chucked.

346
00:31:39,625 --> 00:31:41,000
What the fun, Harry?

347
00:31:45,791 --> 00:31:46,708
Okay..

348
00:31:47,791 --> 00:31:49,208
There's something we need to find.

349
00:31:50,166 --> 00:31:51,916
There's something hiding here, in the castle.

350
00:31:52,291 --> 00:31:54,166
And it might help us to defeat
'You know who'.

351
00:31:54,833 --> 00:31:57,541
- Alright, what is it?
- We don't know.

352
00:31:59,875 --> 00:32:01,708
- Where is it?
- We don't know that either.

353
00:32:04,125 --> 00:32:05,250
Our realizes are not much to go on.

354
00:32:05,416 --> 00:32:06,208
That's not to go on.

355
00:32:07,333 --> 00:32:09,333
I think it has something to do with Ravenclaw.

356
00:32:09,916 --> 00:32:13,958
It'll be small, easily can sealed.

357
00:32:15,083 --> 00:32:16,375
Anyone have any ideas?

358
00:32:18,250 --> 00:32:20,958
Well, there is Rowena Ravenclow's lost diadem.

359
00:32:20,958 --> 00:32:22,125
Oh, bloody hell!
Here we go!

360
00:32:23,291 --> 00:32:25,916
lost diadem of Ravenclow?

361
00:32:25,916 --> 00:32:27,375
Hasn't anyone heard of this?

362
00:32:28,375 --> 00:32:29,250
It's quite famous.

363
00:32:29,625 --> 00:32:31,583
Yes. But, Luna, it's lost.

364
00:32:32,166 --> 00:32:35,333
For centuries.
There not person alive today who've seen it.

365
00:32:36,333 --> 00:32:38,291
Excuse me, can someone tell me what bloody diadem is?

366
00:32:38,291 --> 00:32:39,708
It's a sort of crown.

367
00:32:40,125 --> 00:32:41,041
You know, like a tiara.

368
00:32:44,166 --> 00:32:45,000
Harry!

369
00:32:46,208 --> 00:32:47,708
Hi, there.

370
00:32:50,916 --> 00:32:53,833
6.1 inches and can't see me?
It's like I'm Frankie Verci.

371
00:32:53,833 --> 00:32:54,833
I'm her brother!

372
00:32:54,833 --> 00:32:57,666
- She only want you, Harry.
- Shit up, Seamus!

373
00:32:58,291 --> 00:32:58,625
What is it, Ginny?

374
00:32:59,916 --> 00:33:03,375
Snape knows... he knows
that Harry is in Hogsmeade.

375
00:33:41,458 --> 00:33:45,625
Many of you are surely wondering,
why I have summoned you at this hour.

376
00:33:48,875 --> 00:33:51,541
It's came to my attention,
that earlier this evening..

377
00:33:53,958 --> 00:33:56,208
Harry Potter was sighted in Hogsmeade.

378
00:33:58,375 --> 00:33:59,625
Now..

379
00:34:00,541 --> 00:34:01,583
should anyone..

380
00:34:03,125 --> 00:34:08,416
student or staff attempt to aid Mr. Potter?

381
00:34:09,541 --> 00:34:17,583
They will be punished in a manner consistent with
the severity of their transcription, further more.

382
00:34:18,625 --> 00:34:22,083
Any person found have
knowledge of these events...

383
00:34:24,208 --> 00:34:27,958
who fails to come forward...

384
00:34:28,750 --> 00:34:36,583
will be treated as equally guilty.

385
00:34:39,375 --> 00:34:40,166
No one?!

386
00:34:44,125 --> 00:34:52,500
If anyone in here has any knowledge of
Mr. Potter's movements this evening.

387
00:34:54,708 --> 00:34:57,833
I invite 'em to step forward.

388
00:35:01,916 --> 00:35:03,208
Now!

389
00:35:17,625 --> 00:35:21,833
It seems to spike your excusive defensive strategies..

390
00:35:21,833 --> 00:35:23,958
you're secuirty problem solving
from us, headmaster...

391
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:29,416
I'm afraid it's quite extensive.

392
00:35:30,875 --> 00:35:33,000
How dare you stand where he stood?!

393
00:35:34,625 --> 00:35:38,708
Tell 'em how it happened that night?
Tell them how you looked in the eye..

394
00:35:39,041 --> 00:35:41,125
a man who trusted you, and killed him.

395
00:35:41,625 --> 00:35:42,791
Tell them!

396
00:36:17,583 --> 00:36:19,458
<i>Harry.</i>

397
00:36:20,166 --> 00:36:21,166
Potter?

398
00:36:54,833 --> 00:36:59,541
<i>I know that many of you are want to fight.</i>

399
00:37:00,125 --> 00:37:04,791
<i>Some of you might even think to defy this wise.</i>

400
00:37:05,583 --> 00:37:07,875
<i>But this is foolish.</i>

401
00:37:08,833 --> 00:37:11,833
<i>Give me Harry Potter.</i>

402
00:37:12,416 --> 00:37:16,458
<i>Do this and this will be ended.</i>

403
00:37:16,458 --> 00:37:22,958
<i>Give me Harry Potter,
and I shall leave Hogwarts untouched.</i>

404
00:37:22,958 --> 00:37:29,250
<i>Give me Harry Potter,
and you will be rewarded.</i>

405
00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:32,166
<i>You have 1 hour.</i>

406
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:45,291
What're you waiting for?
Someone grab him!

407
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:58,875
Students out of bed!

408
00:37:59,250 --> 00:38:01,166
Students in the corridor!

409
00:38:01,166 --> 00:38:03,750
They're supposed to be out
of bed, you blithering idiot!

410
00:38:07,416 --> 00:38:08,166
Sorry ma'am.

411
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:10,083
As it happened, Mr. Filch..

412
00:38:10,083 --> 00:38:11,708
Your arrival has loosed appertunate.

413
00:38:12,583 --> 00:38:18,916
If you would, I'd like you please, to lead Ms. Parkinson
and the rest of Slytherin house, from the hall.

414
00:38:18,916 --> 00:38:21,666
Exactly where is it I'll be leading them to, ma'am?

415
00:38:21,666 --> 00:38:23,125
The dungeons would do.

416
00:38:26,166 --> 00:38:28,000
Alright, come on! Come on!

417
00:38:28,791 --> 00:38:31,041
I assume you have a reason for returning, Potter.

418
00:38:31,041 --> 00:38:32,250
What is it you need?

419
00:38:32,250 --> 00:38:34,916
Time, Professor.
As much as you can get me.

420
00:38:35,416 --> 00:38:36,625
Do what you have to do.

421
00:38:36,625 --> 00:38:38,291
I'll secure the castle.

422
00:38:39,541 --> 00:38:40,875
Potter..

423
00:38:43,041 --> 00:38:44,166
it's good to see you.

424
00:38:45,708 --> 00:38:47,208
It's good to see you too, Professor.

425
00:39:01,875 --> 00:39:02,458
Harry!

426
00:39:03,333 --> 00:39:05,875
Hermione and I were thinking,
it doesn't matter if we find all Horcruxes.

427
00:39:06,083 --> 00:39:06,958
What do you mean?

428
00:39:07,250 --> 00:39:08,416
Unleast we can destroy it.

429
00:39:08,833 --> 00:39:10,041
So, we were thinking...

430
00:39:10,041 --> 00:39:11,666
Well, Ron was thinking, it was his idea.

431
00:39:11,791 --> 00:39:12,458
It was completely brilliant

432
00:39:12,458 --> 00:39:14,500
You destroyed Tom Riddle's
diary with the basilisk fangs, right?

433
00:39:16,250 --> 00:39:18,083
Well, me and Hermione might
know where to find one.

434
00:39:18,083 --> 00:39:18,916
Okay.

435
00:39:20,041 --> 00:39:21,041
Okay, but take this.

436
00:39:21,708 --> 00:39:23,000
That way, you can find me when you get back.

437
00:39:23,625 --> 00:39:24,416
Where're you going?

438
00:39:24,416 --> 00:39:26,833
Ravenclaw common room,
Gotta start somewhere.

439
00:39:32,958 --> 00:39:33,833
Harry!

440
00:39:34,916 --> 00:39:36,041
Harry?

441
00:39:36,541 --> 00:39:37,875
Let me get it straight, Professor...

442
00:39:38,333 --> 00:39:40,125
you actually give us
a permission to do this?

443
00:39:40,166 --> 00:39:42,375
That is correct, Longbottom.

444
00:39:42,375 --> 00:39:43,541
That's blowin' up!
Boom!

445
00:39:43,541 --> 00:39:44,333
Boom!

446
00:39:45,041 --> 00:39:46,416
Wicked!

447
00:39:46,833 --> 00:39:48,041
How are we gonna do that?

448
00:39:48,833 --> 00:39:50,791
Why don't you confirm with Mr. Finnigan?

449
00:39:51,166 --> 00:39:54,833
As I record, he has a particular
proclivity for pirate technics.

450
00:39:54,833 --> 00:39:55,750
I can bring it down.

451
00:39:55,750 --> 00:39:57,541
That's the spirit!
Well, you go.

452
00:39:59,083 --> 00:40:02,375
You do relize, of course, we can't
keep out 'You know who' definitely.

453
00:40:02,541 --> 00:40:04,916
That doesn't mean
we can't delay him.

454
00:40:05,958 --> 00:40:10,416
And his name is Voldemort.
Filius you might will use it.

455
00:40:10,416 --> 00:40:12,916
He's come to try to kill you, either we!

456
00:40:15,375 --> 00:40:18,500
Piertotum Locomotor.

457
00:40:33,708 --> 00:40:35,291
Hogwarts is menaced.

458
00:40:35,291 --> 00:40:38,958
Men of borders protect us.
Do your duty...

459
00:40:38,958 --> 00:40:40,375
to our school.

460
00:40:44,291 --> 00:40:46,791
I always wanted to use that spell!

461
00:40:56,333 --> 00:40:58,500
Ontejo Maxamm Biyanto Dory.

462
00:40:59,625 --> 00:41:02,958
Ontejo Maxamm Biyanto Dory.

463
00:41:04,041 --> 00:41:06,291
Ontejo Maxamm Biyanto Dory.

464
00:41:37,125 --> 00:41:38,416
Harry, wait!

465
00:41:39,083 --> 00:41:40,083
I need to talk to you!

466
00:41:40,083 --> 00:41:42,875
- I'm a bit for you, Luna.
- You don't know where are going.

467
00:41:43,041 --> 00:41:44,291
You're waisting your time!

468
00:41:44,291 --> 00:41:45,458
Look, we'll talk later, okay?

469
00:41:45,458 --> 00:41:46,500
- Harry?
- Later.

470
00:41:46,916 --> 00:41:49,083
Harry Potter, you listen to me right now!

471
00:41:50,875 --> 00:41:54,083
Do you remember what Cho said
about Rowena Ravenclow lost diadem?

472
00:41:54,458 --> 00:41:56,458
There is no person alive who've seen it.

473
00:41:57,833 --> 00:41:59,041
It's obvious, isn't it?

474
00:41:59,416 --> 00:42:01,083
We have to talk to someone who is dead.

475
00:42:12,041 --> 00:42:13,375
It's very impressive, isn't it?

476
00:42:29,333 --> 00:42:32,416
If you want to find her,
you'll find her down there.

477
00:42:32,416 --> 00:42:33,541
- Aren't you coming?
- No.

478
00:42:33,791 --> 00:42:35,666
I think it's best, if you two talk alone.

479
00:42:36,375 --> 00:42:37,375
She's very shy.

480
00:43:03,750 --> 00:43:04,958
You're the Grey Lady.

481
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,458
The ghost of Ravenclaw tower.

482
00:43:07,958 --> 00:43:09,458
I do not answer to that name!

483
00:43:09,458 --> 00:43:11,125
No, I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

484
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:12,583
It's Helena, isn't it?

485
00:43:13,250 --> 00:43:15,541
Helena Ravenclaw,
Rowena's daughter.

486
00:43:16,291 --> 00:43:18,250
Are you a friend of Luna's?

487
00:43:18,458 --> 00:43:19,125
Yes.

488
00:43:20,166 --> 00:43:22,000
And she told me you will be able to help me.

489
00:43:24,625 --> 00:43:26,625
You seek my mother's diadem?

490
00:43:28,625 --> 00:43:29,375
Yes.

491
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:31,791
That's right.

492
00:43:33,416 --> 00:43:35,250
Luna is kind.

493
00:43:35,916 --> 00:43:37,791
Unlike so many of the others.

494
00:43:38,291 --> 00:43:41,583
But she was wrong,
I can not help you!

495
00:43:45,416 --> 00:43:47,208
Wait, please!

496
00:43:49,583 --> 00:43:50,958
I want to destroy it!

497
00:44:27,833 --> 00:44:29,333
They never learn.

498
00:44:31,375 --> 00:44:32,583
Such a petty.

499
00:44:34,666 --> 00:44:35,625
My Lord..

500
00:44:36,875 --> 00:44:38,000
shouldn't we wait?

501
00:44:45,708 --> 00:44:47,125
Begin!

502
00:45:06,833 --> 00:45:08,791
I thought you want to do this to it.
Right, Helena?

503
00:45:14,625 --> 00:45:16,000
You want to destroy it?

504
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,541
My mother has wanted
to destroy it many years ago.

505
00:45:19,208 --> 00:45:21,583
The Strange Boy, what a strange name?!

506
00:45:21,916 --> 00:45:22,875
Tom Riddle.

507
00:45:22,875 --> 00:45:24,083
But he lied.

508
00:45:24,916 --> 00:45:26,000
He's lied to many people.

509
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:29,375
I know what he had done!
I know who he is!

510
00:45:29,375 --> 00:45:32,416
He defiled it, with dark magic!

511
00:45:46,208 --> 00:45:47,583
I can destroy it.

512
00:45:47,583 --> 00:45:49,166
Once and for all.

513
00:45:51,791 --> 00:45:53,750
But only if you tell
where he hide it?

514
00:45:56,416 --> 00:45:59,583
You do know where he hide it?

515
00:46:00,166 --> 00:46:01,375
Don't you, Helena?

516
00:46:03,583 --> 00:46:04,625
You just have to tell me.

517
00:46:07,041 --> 00:46:07,833
Please!

518
00:46:20,208 --> 00:46:21,291
Strange!

519
00:46:25,125 --> 00:46:27,208
You remind me of him a bit.

520
00:46:29,291 --> 00:46:32,083
It's here, in the castle.

521
00:46:33,166 --> 00:46:35,041
In the place where everything is hidden.

522
00:46:37,333 --> 00:46:38,958
If you have to ask..

523
00:46:38,958 --> 00:46:40,458
you will never know.

524
00:46:42,291 --> 00:46:43,375
If you know..

525
00:46:43,375 --> 00:46:44,916
you need only ask.

526
00:46:46,916 --> 00:46:48,250
Thank you!

527
00:47:00,791 --> 00:47:04,250
Tell Professor McGonagall.
Remus and I will handle the castle.

528
00:47:05,666 --> 00:47:07,000
Yes, sir!

529
00:47:10,875 --> 00:47:16,791
Eddie, with second thoughts, tell Professor McGonagall
would might need one or two more ones to side.

530
00:47:18,750 --> 00:47:22,041
It's the quality of who has conviction
as to terminate the success...

531
00:47:22,041 --> 00:47:23,333
not the number of followers.

532
00:47:24,250 --> 00:47:25,583
Who said that?

533
00:47:26,458 --> 00:47:26,875
Me.

534
00:47:32,416 --> 00:47:33,250
You okay, Freddy?

535
00:47:34,291 --> 00:47:35,083
Yeah.

536
00:47:37,375 --> 00:47:38,208
Me too.

537
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,791
Harry's talk as snakes.

538
00:47:57,250 --> 00:47:58,000
You know it?

539
00:47:59,666 --> 00:48:01,291
No, of course, no!

540
00:48:47,375 --> 00:48:50,291
Yeah?
You and whose army?

541
00:49:09,875 --> 00:49:11,041
You do it.

542
00:49:11,291 --> 00:49:11,916
I can't.

543
00:49:11,916 --> 00:49:12,708
Yes, you can!

544
00:52:04,250 --> 00:52:05,541
Neville!

545
00:52:22,375 --> 00:52:23,458
That went well.

546
00:53:08,166 --> 00:53:09,416
Get inside!

547
00:53:34,041 --> 00:53:37,041
Ginny, Neville!
You alright?

548
00:53:37,041 --> 00:53:37,958
Never better!

549
00:53:38,250 --> 00:53:39,541
I feel like I've been spitting fire!

550
00:53:39,916 --> 00:53:41,083
Did you see Luna up there?

551
00:53:41,083 --> 00:53:42,250
Luna?

552
00:53:51,083 --> 00:53:51,750
I know.

553
00:54:19,875 --> 00:54:21,625
Bloody hell!
We'll never find him on this.

554
00:54:22,583 --> 00:54:23,083
Here he is!

555
00:54:23,625 --> 00:54:25,250
- He's just..
- Brilliant!

556
00:54:25,250 --> 00:54:25,958
He just vanished.

557
00:54:26,791 --> 00:54:27,833
I sure that I saw it.

558
00:54:31,208 --> 00:54:33,000
Maybe he's gone to the room of vault.

559
00:54:33,291 --> 00:54:34,458
It doesn't show up on the map, does it?

560
00:54:34,791 --> 00:54:35,666
You said that last year.

561
00:54:36,833 --> 00:54:38,208
That's right, I did.

562
00:54:39,250 --> 00:54:40,000
Let's go.

563
00:54:41,583 --> 00:54:42,708
Brilliant!

564
00:54:49,041 --> 00:54:49,458
Come on!

565
00:56:37,583 --> 00:56:38,666
Well, then..

566
00:56:40,041 --> 00:56:41,250
what brought you to here, Potter?

567
00:56:42,666 --> 00:56:44,166
I could ask you the same.

568
00:56:44,875 --> 00:56:46,375
You have something that's mine.

569
00:56:47,583 --> 00:56:48,708
I'd like you back.

570
00:56:49,666 --> 00:56:50,791
What's wrong with the one you have?

571
00:56:50,791 --> 00:56:51,708
It's my mother's.

572
00:56:51,958 --> 00:56:53,750
It's powerful, but it's...

573
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:54,833
not the same.

574
00:56:55,833 --> 00:56:58,375
Doesn't quite understand me.

575
00:56:59,708 --> 00:57:00,666
You know what I mean?

576
00:57:01,291 --> 00:57:02,708
Why don't you tell her?

577
00:57:05,125 --> 00:57:05,791
Bellatrix?

578
00:57:09,083 --> 00:57:10,708
You knew he's me.

579
00:57:11,916 --> 00:57:12,833
You didn't say nothing.

580
00:57:13,583 --> 00:57:14,625
Come on, Draco!

581
00:57:15,458 --> 00:57:16,500
Do not be a coward.

582
00:57:17,041 --> 00:57:18,083
Do it!

583
00:57:19,375 --> 00:57:19,791
Easy!

584
00:57:21,291 --> 00:57:22,416
Expleiona!

585
00:57:23,333 --> 00:57:24,250
Avona Getarta!

586
00:57:29,458 --> 00:57:31,458
This is my girlfriend,
you bloody nuts!

587
00:57:53,041 --> 00:57:53,833
Do it!

588
00:58:08,791 --> 00:58:11,000
Go, they've set the bloody place on fire!

589
00:59:16,375 --> 00:59:17,750
Come on!
This way!

590
00:59:25,375 --> 00:59:26,500
We can't leave them!

591
00:59:27,375 --> 00:59:28,416
He's joking, right?

592
00:59:37,916 --> 00:59:40,333
If we died for them,
Harry, I'm gonna kill you!

593
01:00:02,291 --> 01:00:02,875
Harry!

594
01:00:48,083 --> 01:00:48,791
My Lord?

595
01:00:49,500 --> 01:00:50,708
Avara Kadabra!

596
01:00:58,208 --> 01:01:02,250
Come Nagini, I need keep you safe.

597
01:01:14,166 --> 01:01:14,708
It's the snake.

598
01:01:16,041 --> 01:01:16,958
She's the last one.

599
01:01:17,250 --> 01:01:19,125
It's the last Horcrux.

600
01:01:26,166 --> 01:01:27,375
Look inside him, Harry.

601
01:01:28,541 --> 01:01:31,791
Find out where he is,
if you find him, we could find the snake.

602
01:01:32,416 --> 01:01:33,708
And we can end this!

603
01:02:00,583 --> 01:02:01,125
My Lord..

604
01:02:02,583 --> 01:02:05,791
Might be there is less...

605
01:02:07,083 --> 01:02:10,333
I should not be more pretend to call off this attack.

606
01:02:11,500 --> 01:02:13,250
Simply seek the boy.

607
01:02:13,541 --> 01:02:14,541
Yourself.

608
01:02:14,541 --> 01:02:17,250
I do not need to seek the boy..

609
01:02:17,750 --> 01:02:22,000
before the night is out, he will come to me!
Do you understand?

610
01:02:23,541 --> 01:02:24,458
Look at me!

611
01:02:25,416 --> 01:02:28,958
How can you live with yourself, Lucius?

612
01:02:29,541 --> 01:02:30,750
I don't know.

613
01:02:33,416 --> 01:02:35,208
Go and find Severus.

614
01:02:36,083 --> 01:02:37,541
Bring him to me.

615
01:02:46,083 --> 01:02:47,083
I know where he is.

616
01:02:57,333 --> 01:02:58,041
Come on!

617
01:03:45,041 --> 01:03:46,333
No!

618
01:04:30,500 --> 01:04:33,958
You have performed extra-ordinary
magic with this wand, My Lord,

619
01:04:34,250 --> 01:04:36,375
in the last few hours?

620
01:04:36,375 --> 01:04:37,000
No!

621
01:04:38,791 --> 01:04:45,250
No! Now, I am extra-ordinary.
But the wand resist me .

622
01:04:45,708 --> 01:04:50,916
There is no wand more powerful
Ollivander himself has made it.

623
01:04:51,583 --> 01:04:56,083
Tonight, when the boy comes.
It will not fail you, I am sure ..

624
01:04:58,500 --> 01:05:04,500
It answers to you,
and you only.

625
01:05:05,583 --> 01:05:06,375
Does it?

626
01:05:09,458 --> 01:05:10,708
My Lord?

627
01:05:12,875 --> 01:05:16,750
The wand, does it truly
answered to me?

628
01:05:18,708 --> 01:05:20,958
You're a clever man, Severus.

629
01:05:21,500 --> 01:05:22,500
Surely you must know...

630
01:05:24,791 --> 01:05:29,291
- Where does true loyalty lie?
- With you..

631
01:05:30,333 --> 01:05:32,708
of course, My Lord.

632
01:05:33,041 --> 01:05:39,708
The Elder wand cannot serve me properly,
because I am not its true master.

633
01:05:41,333 --> 01:05:45,875
The Elder wand belongs to the
wizard who killed it's last owner.

634
01:05:52,083 --> 01:05:54,666
You killed Dumbledore, Severus.

635
01:05:56,583 --> 01:06:00,375
While you live the Elder
wand cannot truly be mine.

636
01:06:02,750 --> 01:06:11,083
You've been a good and faithful servant, Severus.
But only I can live forever.

637
01:06:15,041 --> 01:06:16,000
My Lord...

638
01:06:21,916 --> 01:06:23,875
Nagini, kill!

639
01:06:42,625 --> 01:06:43,833
Wait!

640
01:07:22,666 --> 01:07:29,458
Take it...
Take it, please!

641
01:07:30,500 --> 01:07:33,041
Give me something!
Quickly, a flask. Anything!

642
01:07:52,197 --> 01:07:53,824
Take them to the Pensieve.

643
01:07:57,077 --> 01:07:57,786
Look at me...

644
01:08:04,251 --> 01:08:06,003
You really have your mother's eyes.

645
01:08:38,702 --> 01:08:44,500
<i>You've fought valiantly,
but in vain...</i>

646
01:08:49,212 --> 01:08:56,094
<i>I do not wish this. Every drop of magical blood
spilled is a terrible waste.</i>

647
01:08:57,136 --> 01:09:00,224
<i>I therefore command my forces to retreat...</i>

648
01:09:01,057 --> 01:09:06,229
<i>In their absence,
dispose of your dead with dignity,</i>

649
01:09:07,146 --> 01:09:12,319
<i>Harry Potter, I now speak directly to you.</i>

650
01:09:12,860 --> 01:09:20,202
<i>On this night, you have allowed your friends to die
for you, rather than face me yourself.</i>

651
01:09:20,618 --> 01:09:26,750
<i>There is no greater dishonor.
Join me in the Forbidden Forrest...</i>

652
01:09:26,750 --> 01:09:28,918
<i>...and confront your fate.</i>

653
01:09:30,002 --> 01:09:42,599
<i>If you do not do this, I shall kill every last man,
woman and child who tries to conceal you from me.</i>

654
01:10:02,034 --> 01:10:03,036
Where's everybody?

655
01:10:28,186 --> 01:10:28,686
Harry?

656
01:10:34,318 --> 01:10:38,654
Oh, come on!
Don't be sad on it, she's passed.

657
01:10:40,364 --> 01:10:41,783
There, she's gone.

658
01:12:45,698 --> 01:12:50,996
<i>Freak! Come here! I'm gonna tell mommy!
You're freak!</i>

659
01:12:51,704 --> 01:12:53,457
<i>You're freak, Lily!</i>

660
01:12:53,457 --> 01:12:54,082
<i>Come here!</i>

661
01:13:15,645 --> 01:13:18,856
<i>She's jealous.
She's ordinary and you're special.</i>

662
01:13:18,856 --> 01:13:19,858
<i>That's not true, Severus.</i>

663
01:13:42,672 --> 01:13:44,048
<i>Gryffindor!</i>

664
01:13:51,681 --> 01:13:53,850
<i>- Hi, I'm James.
- Hi, I'm Lily.</i>

665
01:13:59,148 --> 01:14:00,439
<i>Just like your father.</i>

666
01:14:03,152 --> 01:14:04,944
<i>Don't say a word against my father!</i>

667
01:14:13,453 --> 01:14:17,082
<i>Masters shall be reunited once more!</i>

668
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:18,667
<i>Severus.</i>

669
01:14:20,711 --> 01:14:21,587
<i>Don't kill me!</i>

670
01:14:22,753 --> 01:14:25,506
The prophecy did not has said it's woman.

671
01:14:26,466 --> 01:14:29,051
It spoke about a boy born in the end of the July.

672
01:14:29,051 --> 01:14:30,804
Yes, but it's her son!

673
01:14:31,512 --> 01:14:34,015
intends to hunt them down and kill them.

674
01:14:34,765 --> 01:14:38,686
Hide him.. hide them all.
I beg you!

675
01:14:39,020 --> 01:14:41,773
What well you give me in exchange, Severus?

676
01:14:43,859 --> 01:14:45,819
- Anything.
- Harry...

677
01:14:45,819 --> 01:14:47,613
<i>Harry, you were so loved.</i>

678
01:14:48,029 --> 01:14:52,242
<i>So loved!
Harry, mama loves you.</i>

679
01:14:53,452 --> 01:14:54,869
Dada loves you.

680
01:14:56,579 --> 01:14:58,457
Harry, be safe.

681
01:14:59,082 --> 01:15:00,082
Be strong.

682
01:15:00,082 --> 01:15:01,960
<i>Avara Kadabra!</i>

683
01:15:06,715 --> 01:15:10,426
You promised to keep them safe.

684
01:15:10,426 --> 01:15:11,720
Lily and James...

685
01:15:12,095 --> 01:15:14,515
for their faithing in the wrong person, Severus.

686
01:15:15,474 --> 01:15:16,265
One like you.

687
01:15:19,435 --> 01:15:20,770
The boy survived.

688
01:15:20,770 --> 01:15:23,148
He doesn't need protection,
the Dark Lord has gone.

689
01:15:23,148 --> 01:15:24,690
The Dark Lord will return.

690
01:15:25,609 --> 01:15:27,819
When he does, the
boy will in terrible danger!

691
01:15:30,363 --> 01:15:31,489
He has her eyes.

692
01:15:35,577 --> 01:15:37,829
If you truly loved her...

693
01:15:41,375 --> 01:15:45,045
No one, can know.

694
01:15:45,045 --> 01:15:48,006
<i>I shall never view
your best dids, Severus.</i>

695
01:15:48,006 --> 01:15:49,173
<i>Your word?</i>

696
01:15:49,173 --> 01:15:51,635
<i>Can you rescue your life
everyday to protect the boy?</i>

697
01:15:58,015 --> 01:15:59,225
<i>Don't tell a word, that's my father!</i>

698
01:16:00,476 --> 01:16:04,398
<i>James Potter, lazy, arrogant.</i>

699
01:16:04,398 --> 01:16:07,484
<i>- My father was a great man!
- Your father was swain!</i>

700
01:16:09,444 --> 01:16:14,867
Drink it, it will content the curse to
your hand, for the current day.

701
01:16:14,867 --> 01:16:17,828
- It will spread.
- How... how long?

702
01:16:19,579 --> 01:16:21,372
Maybe a year.

703
01:16:24,292 --> 01:16:25,543
Don't ignore me, Severus.

704
01:16:27,045 --> 01:16:30,798
We both know Lord Voldemort has
orderd the Malfoy boy to murder me.

705
01:16:32,967 --> 01:16:38,390
But if he fails, I should presume
the Dark Lord will turn to you.

706
01:16:41,768 --> 01:16:44,188
You must be the one to kill me, Severus.

707
01:16:45,480 --> 01:16:47,064
It is the only way.

708
01:16:48,859 --> 01:16:52,695
Only then, will the Dark Lord trust you completely.

709
01:16:58,702 --> 01:17:02,331
Will come a time, when Harry Potter,
must be told something.

710
01:17:04,832 --> 01:17:10,005
But you must wait, until Voldemort is at his most vulnerable.

711
01:17:10,296 --> 01:17:12,131
Must be told what?

712
01:17:13,132 --> 01:17:17,136
On the night, Lord Voldemort went
to Godric's Hollow to kill Harry...

713
01:17:19,389 --> 01:17:21,641
Then, Lily Potter obstacle between them...

714
01:17:22,475 --> 01:17:24,185
the curse we bounded.

715
01:17:25,979 --> 01:17:29,399
And when that happens, a part of Voldemort's sould..

716
01:17:29,817 --> 01:17:33,612
contained itself in the only living thing he could find...

717
01:17:34,363 --> 01:17:35,738
Harry himself.

718
01:17:37,908 --> 01:17:40,327
There's a reason Harry can speak with snakes...

719
01:17:41,619 --> 01:17:44,581
There's a reason he can look into Lord Voldemort's mind...

720
01:17:46,625 --> 01:17:52,547
A part of Voldemort lives inside him.

721
01:17:58,261 --> 01:18:00,221
So, when the time comes..

722
01:18:02,099 --> 01:18:03,850
the boy must die?

723
01:18:06,520 --> 01:18:09,814
Yes.. yes.
He must die.

724
01:18:28,125 --> 01:18:31,878
You've kept on his life, so he can
die at the required moment?

725
01:18:36,382 --> 01:18:39,261
You've been raising him like a pig for slaught.

726
01:18:39,927 --> 01:18:43,181
Don't tell me now, that you've
grown up care for me.

727
01:19:01,992 --> 01:19:02,909
Lily!

728
01:19:06,913 --> 01:19:07,997
After all this time!

729
01:19:12,543 --> 01:19:13,377
Always.

730
01:19:19,134 --> 01:19:21,011
So, when the time comes..

731
01:19:22,637 --> 01:19:24,139
the boy must die?

732
01:19:25,265 --> 01:19:25,890
Yes.

733
01:19:27,309 --> 01:19:31,270
He must die.
And Voldemort himself must do it.

734
01:19:32,146 --> 01:19:33,314
That is a sensual.

735
01:20:36,252 --> 01:20:38,630
- Where've you been?
- I thought you went to that forest.

736
01:20:38,921 --> 01:20:39,631
I'm going there now.

737
01:20:40,381 --> 01:20:42,301
Are you mad?
No...

738
01:20:44,261 --> 01:20:45,511
You can't give yourself up to him.

739
01:20:49,682 --> 01:20:50,684
What is it, Harry?

740
01:20:52,478 --> 01:20:54,188
What is it you know?

741
01:20:57,399 --> 01:20:59,109
There is a reason I can hear them.

742
01:21:00,610 --> 01:21:01,694
The Horcruxes.

743
01:21:04,323 --> 01:21:05,657
I think I've known it for a while.

744
01:21:07,826 --> 01:21:09,077
And I think you've known that too.

745
01:21:12,831 --> 01:21:15,042
- I'll go with you.
- No, you kill the snake.

746
01:21:16,627 --> 01:21:18,252
Kill the snake, and it's just him!

747
01:22:35,663 --> 01:22:36,539
I'm ready to die.

748
01:23:17,288 --> 01:23:18,832
Resurrection Stone.

749
01:23:48,069 --> 01:23:49,947
You've been so brave, sweetheart.

750
01:23:55,493 --> 01:23:58,412
Why you're here?
All of you?

751
01:24:01,792 --> 01:24:02,960
We never left.

752
01:24:12,469 --> 01:24:13,220
Does...

753
01:24:14,595 --> 01:24:15,889
Does it hurt?

754
01:24:17,015 --> 01:24:17,765
Dying?

755
01:24:19,059 --> 01:24:20,644
Quicker than falling in sleep.

756
01:24:24,981 --> 01:24:26,608
You needed this, son.

757
01:24:28,025 --> 01:24:29,027
I'm sorry.

758
01:24:29,319 --> 01:24:31,654
I never wanted any of you to die for me.

759
01:24:34,073 --> 01:24:35,701
And, Remus, your son?

760
01:24:35,908 --> 01:24:38,578
Others will tell him, what his
mother and father died for.

761
01:24:39,954 --> 01:24:42,498
One day, he'll understand.

762
01:24:54,595 --> 01:24:55,929
You'll stay with me?

763
01:24:57,722 --> 01:24:58,724
Until the end.

764
01:25:00,309 --> 01:25:01,935
Anybody will be able to see you?

765
01:25:02,603 --> 01:25:03,561
No.

766
01:25:05,314 --> 01:25:06,731
We're here, you see.

767
01:25:21,622 --> 01:25:22,831
Stay close to me.

768
01:25:25,792 --> 01:25:26,542
Always.

769
01:25:41,641 --> 01:25:44,269
No sing of him, My Lord.

770
01:26:00,202 --> 01:26:01,494
I thought he'd come.

771
01:26:42,161 --> 01:26:43,703
Harry, no!

772
01:26:44,078 --> 01:26:46,206
- What are you doing here?
- Quite!

773
01:26:57,176 --> 01:26:58,594
Harry Potter...

774
01:27:02,472 --> 01:27:04,140
the boy who lived...

775
01:27:09,395 --> 01:27:10,771
come to die.

776
01:27:28,957 --> 01:27:30,917
Avara Kadabra!

777
01:28:24,805 --> 01:28:25,972
You can't help...

778
01:28:27,431 --> 01:28:30,185
Harry, you wonderful boy..

779
01:28:31,520 --> 01:28:34,689
you brave-brave man!

780
01:28:37,234 --> 01:28:38,152
Let us walk.

781
01:28:46,118 --> 01:28:47,327
Professor, what is that?

782
01:28:50,788 --> 01:28:52,666
Something beyond our limit of help.

783
01:28:56,627 --> 01:28:58,755
A part of Voldemort sent here to die.

784
01:29:00,090 --> 01:29:01,382
And exactly where are we?

785
01:29:02,551 --> 01:29:03,969
I was gonna ask you that.

786
01:29:04,802 --> 01:29:05,970
Where would you say where we are?

787
01:29:06,512 --> 01:29:09,682
Well, it looks like King's Cross station.

788
01:29:10,893 --> 01:29:12,685
Only cleaner..

789
01:29:13,561 --> 01:29:14,938
and without older trains.

790
01:29:16,023 --> 01:29:17,858
King's Cross, is that right?

791
01:29:19,193 --> 01:29:21,653
This is as they say, 'Your Party'.

792
01:29:23,572 --> 01:29:25,865
I speak to you know as I relized it, you and Voldemort..

793
01:29:26,533 --> 01:29:28,868
has been connected by something out of the fate.

794
01:29:29,703 --> 01:29:32,331
As said by Godric's Hollow orders many years ago.

795
01:29:32,706 --> 01:29:33,916
So it's true then, sir.

796
01:29:33,916 --> 01:29:36,417
A part of him lived with in me, doesn't it?

797
01:29:37,252 --> 01:29:38,212
'Did'.

798
01:29:38,670 --> 01:29:42,507
It has been destroyed many moments
ago by Lord Voldemort himself.

799
01:29:44,467 --> 01:29:48,055
You were the Horcrux you
never ment to make, Harry.

800
01:30:01,025 --> 01:30:04,445
- I have to go back, aren't I?
- Oh, that's up to you.

801
01:30:04,654 --> 01:30:06,823
- I've a choice?
- Yes!

802
01:30:08,283 --> 01:30:10,118
We're in King's Cross as you said.

803
01:30:12,162 --> 01:30:16,291
I think if you are so desired,
you'll be able to bring the train.

804
01:30:18,085 --> 01:30:19,377
And where would it take me?

805
01:30:20,546 --> 01:30:21,380
On.

806
01:30:39,730 --> 01:30:41,399
Voldemort has the Elder wand?

807
01:30:44,485 --> 01:30:45,319
True.

808
01:30:45,319 --> 01:30:46,572
And the snake is still alive?

809
01:30:47,155 --> 01:30:47,780
Yes.

810
01:30:48,657 --> 01:30:49,949
And I've nothing to kill it with?

811
01:30:51,534 --> 01:30:53,828
Helping always will be given at Hogwarts, Harry.

812
01:30:53,828 --> 01:30:55,122
To those who ask for it.

813
01:30:56,998 --> 01:31:00,377
fraze.I've always surprised myself
on my ability to turn a freeze.

814
01:31:01,627 --> 01:31:04,006
Where's my not so humbling opinion...

815
01:31:04,672 --> 01:31:07,384
I'm the most exhaustible sorcerer magic.

816
01:31:08,635 --> 01:31:12,264
Capable of causing inflection
injury and therapies.

817
01:31:12,972 --> 01:31:14,515
But I would in this case..

818
01:31:15,350 --> 01:31:18,020
and turn my original statement to this:

819
01:31:21,230 --> 01:31:24,359
Help, will always be given at Hogwarts.

820
01:31:25,359 --> 01:31:26,612
To those who deserve it.

821
01:31:32,951 --> 01:31:34,744
Do not grieve to the dead, Harry...

822
01:31:35,828 --> 01:31:37,247
grieve to living.

823
01:31:38,457 --> 01:31:39,500
And above all...

824
01:31:39,875 --> 01:31:42,002
all those who live without love.

825
01:31:44,128 --> 01:31:45,881
Professor, my mother's Patronus...

826
01:31:46,881 --> 01:31:48,759
It was a doe, wasn't it?

827
01:31:50,176 --> 01:31:52,054
As the same of Professor Snape's.

828
01:31:53,639 --> 01:31:55,640
It's curious, don't you think?

829
01:31:55,681 --> 01:31:57,559
Actually, if I think about it..

830
01:31:58,018 --> 01:31:59,728
it doesn't seem curious at all!

831
01:32:02,189 --> 01:32:03,606
I'll be going now, Harry.

832
01:32:04,565 --> 01:32:05,734
Professor?

833
01:32:10,488 --> 01:32:11,782
Is this all real?

834
01:32:13,324 --> 01:32:14,909
Or it's just happening inside my head?

835
01:32:14,909 --> 01:32:17,578
Of course it's happening
inside your head, Harry.

836
01:32:18,788 --> 01:32:21,500
Why should that mean, it is not real?

837
01:32:27,296 --> 01:32:28,422
Professor?

838
01:32:29,632 --> 01:32:30,466
What should I do?

839
01:32:34,555 --> 01:32:35,764
Professor?

840
01:32:39,851 --> 01:32:41,603
My Lord, My Lord..

841
01:32:41,895 --> 01:32:42,604
are you hurt?

842
01:32:43,313 --> 01:32:44,898
I don't need you help.

843
01:32:55,742 --> 01:32:56,952
The boy...

844
01:32:57,743 --> 01:32:58,912
is he dead?

845
01:33:13,176 --> 01:33:14,470
Is he alive?

846
01:33:15,345 --> 01:33:16,889
Draco, is he alive?

847
01:33:42,788 --> 01:33:43,832
Dead.

848
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:09,167
Who is that?

849
01:35:09,458 --> 01:35:10,418
Hogwart is carrying?

850
01:35:11,295 --> 01:35:12,587
Neville, who is it?

851
01:35:13,713 --> 01:35:15,256
Harry Potter!

852
01:35:17,091 --> 01:35:19,261
- He's dead!
- No!

853
01:35:19,261 --> 01:35:19,970
No!

854
01:35:19,970 --> 01:35:20,720
Silence!

855
01:35:25,475 --> 01:35:27,060
Stupid girl!

856
01:35:28,436 --> 01:35:29,729
Harry Potter..

857
01:35:29,729 --> 01:35:31,105
is dead!

858
01:35:31,856 --> 01:35:33,233
From this day for..

859
01:35:34,650 --> 01:35:37,904
you'll put your faith in me.

860
01:35:47,997 --> 01:35:49,832
Harry Potter is dead!

861
01:35:54,921 --> 01:35:57,256
And now it's the time to declare yourself.

862
01:35:59,510 --> 01:36:01,636
Come forward and join us...

863
01:36:04,014 --> 01:36:05,140
or die!

864
01:36:11,438 --> 01:36:12,730
Draco!

865
01:36:17,860 --> 01:36:18,737
Draco.

866
01:36:22,114 --> 01:36:23,449
Draco.

867
01:36:26,537 --> 01:36:27,871
Come.

868
01:36:40,591 --> 01:36:42,176
Well done, Draco.

869
01:36:43,470 --> 01:36:44,387
Well done!

870
01:37:06,702 --> 01:37:08,996
Well, I must say I hoped for better.

871
01:37:13,332 --> 01:37:15,335
And who might you be, young man?

872
01:37:17,171 --> 01:37:19,088
Neville Longbottom.

873
01:37:24,344 --> 01:37:28,390
Well, Neville, I'm sure we can
find a place for you in our row.

874
01:37:28,515 --> 01:37:29,557
I wanted to say something.

875
01:37:36,355 --> 01:37:40,735
Well, Neville, I'm sure we'd all be
fascinating to hear what have to say.

876
01:37:44,655 --> 01:37:46,908
- Doesn't matter that Harry is gone.
- Sound down, Neville!

877
01:37:46,908 --> 01:37:48,159
People die everyday!

878
01:37:51,579 --> 01:37:54,291
Friends, family.

879
01:37:57,211 --> 01:37:57,711
Yeah..

880
01:38:00,046 --> 01:38:01,381
we lost Harry today.

881
01:38:03,634 --> 01:38:04,676
He's still with us.

882
01:38:06,094 --> 01:38:07,011
In here.

883
01:38:08,971 --> 01:38:13,268
So as Fred, Remus...

884
01:38:14,478 --> 01:38:15,604
Tonks..

885
01:38:16,979 --> 01:38:18,105
All of them.

886
01:38:20,067 --> 01:38:21,275
They didn't die in vain.

887
01:38:27,032 --> 01:38:28,283
But you will.

888
01:38:28,617 --> 01:38:29,659
Because you're wrong!

889
01:38:30,536 --> 01:38:32,078
Harry has died for us.

890
01:38:32,703 --> 01:38:33,747
For all of us!

891
01:38:34,206 --> 01:38:35,373
But he's not over!

892
01:38:39,627 --> 01:38:40,546
Cavreco!

893
01:38:52,349 --> 01:38:54,225
Come on!

894
01:39:01,315 --> 01:39:02,609
All remain in the castle.

895
01:39:02,984 --> 01:39:03,860
We have to kill the snake.

896
01:39:03,860 --> 01:39:05,112
Hey, Neville!

897
01:41:53,070 --> 01:41:55,073
Not my daughter, you bitch!

898
01:42:27,396 --> 01:42:28,649
Hey, you were right..

899
01:42:30,442 --> 01:42:32,944
when you told Professor Snape
that wand won't serve you.

900
01:42:32,944 --> 01:42:33,904
It was always...

901
01:42:36,030 --> 01:42:37,490
I killed Snape!

902
01:42:37,490 --> 01:42:38,867
Yeah, but what if the wand never belonged to Snape?

903
01:42:39,576 --> 01:42:41,578
What if it's loyalty has always
belonged to someone else?

904
01:42:42,246 --> 01:42:43,538
Oh, come on, Tom...

905
01:42:43,538 --> 01:42:45,289
let's finish this as the way we started it.

906
01:42:46,207 --> 01:42:47,417
Together!

907
01:43:44,349 --> 01:43:45,475
Die!

908
01:46:13,623 --> 01:46:14,582
This boy is a big fella.

909
01:46:24,009 --> 01:46:25,092
Harry!

910
01:47:23,318 --> 01:47:24,278
Why it didn't work for him?

911
01:47:24,944 --> 01:47:25,570
The Elder wand?

912
01:47:27,613 --> 01:47:29,115
It answers to somebody else.

913
01:47:30,283 --> 01:47:33,078
When killed Snape, he thought
the wand will become his.

914
01:47:33,369 --> 01:47:34,037
But the thing is..

915
01:47:35,247 --> 01:47:36,372
The wand never belonged to Sanpe.

916
01:47:37,332 --> 01:47:40,836
It was Draco who disarmed Dumbledore
that night in the Astronomy tower.

917
01:47:41,795 --> 01:47:44,881
From that moment on, and the wand answerd him.

918
01:47:46,550 --> 01:47:50,720
Until, at the night when I disarmed Draco.

919
01:47:51,262 --> 01:47:52,514
At Malfoy's house.

920
01:47:53,055 --> 01:47:54,224
So, that means...

921
01:47:56,685 --> 01:47:57,394
It's mine!

922
01:48:00,146 --> 01:48:03,108
- What should we do with it?
- We?

923
01:48:04,025 --> 01:48:05,359
Just saying, that the Elder wand.

924
01:48:05,985 --> 01:48:07,529
The most powerful wand in the world.

925
01:48:08,404 --> 01:48:11,158
With that, we'll be invisible.

926
01:49:35,367 --> 01:49:40,413
<i>19 years later.</i>

927
01:50:29,421 --> 01:50:30,213
Together.

928
01:51:07,792 --> 01:51:09,545
- Bag?
- yeah

929
01:51:10,045 --> 01:51:10,878
Jumper?

930
01:51:12,713 --> 01:51:13,881
I'm gonna miss you.

931
01:51:15,134 --> 01:51:16,342
There they come.

932
01:51:31,649 --> 01:51:32,609
Dad?

933
01:51:33,277 --> 01:51:35,112
What if I have gone to the Slytherin?

934
01:51:37,738 --> 01:51:44,162
Albus Severus Potter.
You're named after two headmasters of Hogwarts.

935
01:51:45,329 --> 01:51:49,626
One of them is a Slytherin.
And he was the bravest man I ever known.

936
01:51:51,878 --> 01:51:54,797
- What you say if I am...
- At Slytherin house...

937
01:51:54,965 --> 01:51:57,842
will gain a wonderful young wizard.

938
01:51:59,136 --> 01:52:00,470
Look, listen...

939
01:52:00,679 --> 01:52:03,806
If it really means that much to you,
you can choose Gryffindor.

940
01:52:03,806 --> 01:52:06,894
The sorting hat takes your
choice into account.

941
01:52:07,769 --> 01:52:09,938
-  Really?
- Really.

942
01:52:13,774 --> 01:52:15,444
-  Ready?
-  Ready.

943
01:52:28,748 --> 01:52:29,917
One more time, do that move.

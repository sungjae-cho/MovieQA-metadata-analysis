1
00:01:41,634 --> 00:01:43,499
Griet.

2
00:01:48,341 --> 00:01:49,968
Leave that.

3
00:02:02,922 --> 00:02:05,413
- Griet?
- Father.

4
00:02:24,377 --> 00:02:26,140
Do you remember?

5
00:02:26,179 --> 00:02:27,976
You watched me paint it.

6
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:49,260
I never thought our family
would come to this.

7
00:02:52,872 --> 00:02:55,102
Food may be strange
to your stomach.

8
00:02:59,646 --> 00:03:02,012
Keep clear of their Catholic prayers.

9
00:03:02,048 --> 00:03:05,506
Or if you must be with them
when they pray...

10
00:03:05,552 --> 00:03:07,042
stop your ears.

11
00:04:21,294 --> 00:04:23,762
Give it.
I got Cornelia's too.

12
00:04:23,796 --> 00:04:25,991
- Give it back.
- Stop it!

13
00:04:28,234 --> 00:04:30,566
You did not get it.
I did.

14
00:04:30,637 --> 00:04:33,037
Do you know the house
of Master Vermeer?

15
00:04:33,072 --> 00:04:36,200
Tell Tanneke
the new maid is here.

16
00:04:58,197 --> 00:05:01,132
You took your time.
Lose your way, did you?

17
00:05:03,369 --> 00:05:05,667
Young mistress is out
this morning.

18
00:05:05,738 --> 00:05:08,172
I'm to show you round.

19
00:05:08,207 --> 00:05:11,074
Water for the table.

20
00:05:12,412 --> 00:05:15,176
Take water from the canal
for laundry.

21
00:05:15,214 --> 00:05:17,079
It's clean enough
this side of town.

22
00:05:18,785 --> 00:05:21,583
Soda...
coppers, boiler...

23
00:05:21,621 --> 00:05:23,452
sand and soap.

24
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:25,980
In cooking kitchen you're to help
serve and clear,

25
00:05:26,025 --> 00:05:27,822
buy fish and meat...

26
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:30,454
when young mistress
don't want to.

27
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:32,930
You'll take your meals
with me and the children.

28
00:05:35,601 --> 00:05:37,091
That's your sleeping place.

29
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:41,166
Scour the pots and pans.

30
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:44,732
Young mistress and master sleep
and have company here.

31
00:05:44,811 --> 00:05:46,779
You'll get used to it.

32
00:05:53,886 --> 00:05:55,444
You're to clean in there.

33
00:05:57,924 --> 00:05:59,915
Not now!

34
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:02,291
He's painting.

35
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:14,187
Good morning, madam.

36
00:08:15,595 --> 00:08:17,620
Don't speak till
you're spoken to.

37
00:08:19,031 --> 00:08:22,194
Tanneke showed you what needs
to be done? The laundry and so on?

38
00:08:22,235 --> 00:08:23,532
Yes, madam.

39
00:08:23,569 --> 00:08:27,938
This is only a trial.
Nothing is settled yet.

40
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:54,029
I...

41
00:08:57,169 --> 00:08:59,034
my husband does...

42
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,332
Go in.

43
00:09:04,911 --> 00:09:06,378
Go in.

44
00:09:44,884 --> 00:09:46,852
Disturb nothing.

45
00:09:46,886 --> 00:09:49,047
Leave all just as it is.

46
00:09:52,692 --> 00:09:55,320
Open the shutters,
you can't work in the dark.

47
00:11:53,913 --> 00:11:57,246
You're not the first to forget
your manners in front of his paintings.

48
00:11:59,518 --> 00:12:00,917
<i>Tell me, girl...</i>

49
00:12:00,953 --> 00:12:03,717
do you think it finished?

50
00:12:06,258 --> 00:12:07,657
Three months.

51
00:12:07,693 --> 00:12:10,958
Another three before he's satisfied,
no doubt.

52
00:12:13,199 --> 00:12:14,461
Well get along, girl.

53
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,730
You're not paid
to stand gawping all day.

54
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:25,236
Good to see you.

55
00:12:25,277 --> 00:12:27,245
Are you well?
Yeah.

56
00:12:31,817 --> 00:12:33,910
- Can we go?
- Here's my man.

57
00:12:33,953 --> 00:12:35,443
Paul.

58
00:12:35,488 --> 00:12:37,649
This is Griet,
the new maid.

59
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:38,850
She'll fetch the meat now.

60
00:12:38,891 --> 00:12:39,983
So, Griet...

61
00:12:40,025 --> 00:12:41,822
what takes your fancy?

62
00:12:41,861 --> 00:12:43,795
Nothing is too good
for this family?

63
00:12:43,829 --> 00:12:46,297
An ox tongue
and a dozen chops.

64
00:12:46,332 --> 00:12:47,959
Pieter...

65
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,900
chops...

66
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:51,926
In the book again?

67
00:12:57,143 --> 00:12:58,110
There you are.

68
00:13:05,751 --> 00:13:07,309
This meat's not fresh.

69
00:13:11,724 --> 00:13:13,453
The mistress won't like it.

70
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:16,485
Pieter.

71
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:22,123
Get the parcel
on the cart.

72
00:13:39,618 --> 00:13:40,846
That's better.

73
00:13:42,454 --> 00:13:44,319
We'll see you again, Griet.

74
00:13:44,356 --> 00:13:45,584
Yes.

75
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,024
No!

76
00:13:56,068 --> 00:13:57,695
I'll take that.

77
00:14:00,573 --> 00:14:01,540
Make way now.

78
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:07,077
- What is it?
- Bankrupt.

79
00:14:07,112 --> 00:14:11,048
They've lived next door
for as long as I can remember.

80
00:14:12,818 --> 00:14:14,581
The shame.

81
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:17,413
Lost everything.

82
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:21,986
Watch out for young mistress.

83
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:23,619
She hates money troubles.

84
00:14:25,464 --> 00:14:28,228
She'll turn spiteful at this,
you mark my words.

85
00:14:33,305 --> 00:14:37,241
The last time you said it was
done you kept it another six months!

86
00:14:37,276 --> 00:14:38,641
It will be done soon.

87
00:14:38,677 --> 00:14:41,544
Oh yes, soon.
But when is soon?

88
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:43,639
Next month, next year?

89
00:14:43,682 --> 00:14:45,013
It's all the same to you,

90
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:47,985
if your children starve
and your wife is dressed in rags.

91
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:50,682
When you sit up there
and suck at your paintbrush...

92
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:52,384
You're being ridiculous.
I'm going out.

93
00:14:52,424 --> 00:14:54,585
No, Jan,
don't you dare leave.

94
00:14:58,597 --> 00:15:02,260
One year it got so bad,
they had to sell some of their jewels.

95
00:15:02,301 --> 00:15:06,897
You could imagine
how that pleased her.

96
00:15:06,972 --> 00:15:08,997
She smashed half the china...

97
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:11,770
went to spoil
one of his precious paintings.

98
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:17,144
Well, he's a temper on him too
for all he's so quiet.

99
00:15:20,819 --> 00:15:24,550
She's not set so much as a foot
in his studio from that day to this.

100
00:16:13,505 --> 00:16:15,973
There you are.
Fetch some water.

101
00:16:16,008 --> 00:16:17,373
Hail Mary, Mother of God,

102
00:16:17,409 --> 00:16:19,809
pray for us sinners now
and at the hour of our death.

103
00:16:19,845 --> 00:16:22,973
Six babies. Why does
she have to make such a racket?

104
00:16:23,015 --> 00:16:24,448
Just get on with the work.

105
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:25,711
Push!

106
00:16:29,355 --> 00:16:31,414
I need more rags, girl.

107
00:16:31,457 --> 00:16:32,981
More rags.

108
00:16:39,465 --> 00:16:40,989
Push, push!

109
00:16:41,033 --> 00:16:43,228
Good, that's good!

110
00:16:44,436 --> 00:16:47,030
Oh, Jan,
isn't he just like you?

111
00:16:48,207 --> 00:16:50,334
Johannes, that's it.

112
00:16:50,409 --> 00:16:52,877
Look at him,
he's your little brother.

113
00:17:05,391 --> 00:17:09,020
Take this to the house of your master's
patron, Pieter van Ruijven.

114
00:17:28,781 --> 00:17:31,272
To the left.

115
00:17:31,316 --> 00:17:33,944
Open up,
there's a lady coming in.

116
00:17:35,421 --> 00:17:36,820
That's it.

117
00:17:42,995 --> 00:17:44,587
So, finished at last.

118
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:49,296
Honored guest.

119
00:17:49,334 --> 00:17:53,498
It's the old woman's idea to combine
the birth feast and the viewing.

120
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:55,267
She is a tight fist.

121
00:17:57,342 --> 00:18:00,470
I won't turn out
for small beer and biscuits, tell her.

122
00:18:00,512 --> 00:18:02,571
Me and the brat
deserve a proper feast.

123
00:18:07,453 --> 00:18:10,115
You have a very wide eyes.

124
00:18:10,155 --> 00:18:12,589
What do they call you?

125
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:16,458
- Griet.
- Griet?

126
00:18:17,496 --> 00:18:18,895
Griet.

127
00:18:22,668 --> 00:18:26,069
Your master is a fine painter,
Griet.

128
00:18:26,138 --> 00:18:28,834
The finest in Delft.

129
00:18:28,907 --> 00:18:29,874
He's painted me.

130
00:18:30,976 --> 00:18:33,809
Perhaps that will be
my epitaph.

131
00:18:41,253 --> 00:18:43,346
Look at that dress.

132
00:18:43,388 --> 00:18:45,720
You can almost stroke
the satin.

133
00:18:45,757 --> 00:18:48,851
And the wine winkling
through the glass.

134
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:54,294
Can you imagine yourself
in such finery, Griet?

135
00:18:57,503 --> 00:18:59,562
She loved it, you know.

136
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:03,404
Lace and satin pressed tight
against the plump little bubbies.

137
00:19:04,443 --> 00:19:08,379
The silk, heavy on her thighs.

138
00:19:08,447 --> 00:19:10,108
The gentlemen watching.

139
00:19:11,783 --> 00:19:14,343
My God, she was happy.

140
00:19:14,386 --> 00:19:16,581
She thought she was somebody.

141
00:19:16,622 --> 00:19:18,647
All dressed up like a lady.

142
00:19:20,592 --> 00:19:22,423
Green as grass,
mind you.

143
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:26,290
She had only worked there
a few months

144
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:29,823
before Master Van Ruijven
brought her over to be painted.

145
00:19:29,868 --> 00:19:33,531
Got her into that fine red dress.

146
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:38,075
Poured wine down her
like he was forcing a goose.

147
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:39,543
That dress
can't have stayed on long.

148
00:19:39,578 --> 00:19:43,878
She was carrying his by-blow
before the painting was dry.

149
00:19:48,654 --> 00:19:52,522
He thinks we don't know
how to celebrate a birth, does he?

150
00:20:14,746 --> 00:20:15,940
Come on, keep up.

151
00:20:24,122 --> 00:20:27,580
Come on now, my little one.
I've got a lovely apple for you.

152
00:20:27,626 --> 00:20:29,787
The price was three guilders,
I'm sure of that.

153
00:20:29,828 --> 00:20:33,264
Three guilders...
thank you.

154
00:21:06,331 --> 00:21:07,821
Why are you here?

155
00:21:09,501 --> 00:21:13,460
A nice greeting, when I brought
the meat order just for you.

156
00:21:13,505 --> 00:21:15,370
Better carry it through.

157
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:21,268
Not even a smile
for my pains?

158
00:21:21,346 --> 00:21:23,371
Not today.

159
00:21:24,383 --> 00:21:26,010
Come on.

160
00:21:29,521 --> 00:21:32,115
I'll put it in the book, then.
Owed by Griet...

161
00:21:32,157 --> 00:21:34,352
one smile.

162
00:21:53,845 --> 00:21:55,312
And don't they look marvelous?

163
00:22:02,721 --> 00:22:04,712
Welcome,
Master Van Ruijven.

164
00:22:04,756 --> 00:22:06,053
Mistress Thins.

165
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:31,680
Friends and neighbors,

166
00:22:31,717 --> 00:22:34,686
our honored guest,
Master Van Ruijven...

167
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,483
not only
are we gathered tonight

168
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:39,115
to celebrate the safe delivery
into this world,

169
00:22:39,157 --> 00:22:42,354
praise be to God,
of little Franciscus,

170
00:22:43,795 --> 00:22:47,424
but also to rejoice
at another birth,

171
00:22:47,466 --> 00:22:52,267
a new masterpiece
from the hand of my son-in-law

172
00:22:52,337 --> 00:22:54,168
Johannes Vermeer.

173
00:23:21,833 --> 00:23:23,425
Is this Indian yellow?

174
00:23:26,304 --> 00:23:29,296
Distilled from the urine
of sacred cows

175
00:23:29,374 --> 00:23:31,865
fed only on mango leaves.

176
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:38,313
You've glazed my wife
in dried piss.

177
00:23:43,121 --> 00:23:44,383
It was the right color.

178
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:46,414
No stinting, eh?

179
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:54,194
I cannot bear the suspense
a moment longer, Master Van Ruijven.

180
00:23:54,232 --> 00:23:56,291
Pray tell us
what you think.

181
00:23:56,334 --> 00:23:58,802
This is good.

182
00:24:00,372 --> 00:24:04,672
Color and perspective is true,
the illusion... is perfect.

183
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:11,406
All this skill lavished
on my dear Emilie.

184
00:24:12,451 --> 00:24:13,475
Why...

185
00:24:14,486 --> 00:24:18,115
it's almost as if...
she were thinking.

186
00:24:18,156 --> 00:24:21,648
And have you considered
the subject for your next commission?

187
00:24:21,693 --> 00:24:24,890
We cannot expect you to give up Emilie
for so long again.

188
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:27,421
Considered? It's already in hand.
Didn't I tell you?

189
00:24:27,466 --> 00:24:29,627
A coming fellow
from Amsterdam.

190
00:24:29,668 --> 00:24:32,228
Studied under
Rembrandt van Rijn,

191
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:33,828
though, who hasn't
these days?

192
00:24:36,575 --> 00:24:41,410
"A Merry Company by Candlelight,"
candlelight being his forte.

193
00:24:44,716 --> 00:24:47,116
So, have you decided
what to daub next, Jan?

194
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:50,246
Have you found inspiration up
in that room of yours?

195
00:24:51,256 --> 00:24:55,659
Is there another patron in Delft
with pockets as deep as mine?

196
00:24:55,694 --> 00:24:58,060
I've not yet found a subject.

197
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:55,909
Yes?

198
00:25:55,954 --> 00:25:57,888
About the studio, mistress.

199
00:25:59,524 --> 00:26:01,253
Should I clean the windows?

200
00:26:01,293 --> 00:26:03,853
You don't need to ask me
about such matters.

201
00:26:03,895 --> 00:26:04,884
It's just...

202
00:26:07,365 --> 00:26:09,492
it may change the light.

203
00:26:17,842 --> 00:26:19,207
Of course.

204
00:26:20,845 --> 00:26:21,812
Wash them.

205
00:27:10,362 --> 00:27:12,455
Stay as you were.

206
00:27:19,037 --> 00:27:20,265
By the window.

207
00:27:31,049 --> 00:27:32,573
Drop it.

208
00:27:41,726 --> 00:27:42,715
Just...

209
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,730
You can go.

210
00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:45,583
Brothers and sisters...

211
00:28:45,623 --> 00:28:48,285
welcome to the house
of the Lord God.

212
00:28:48,326 --> 00:28:51,853
Let us lift up our hearts
and voices together

213
00:28:51,896 --> 00:28:55,388
to give Him thanks and praise
for our safe passage...

214
00:29:10,482 --> 00:29:13,883
Father, mother,
this is Pieter,

215
00:29:13,918 --> 00:29:17,217
our butcher's son...
the family's butcher.

216
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:19,689
Sir, mistress,
I'm glad to meet you.

217
00:29:19,724 --> 00:29:24,252
So, the butcher...
that's a good trade.

218
00:29:24,295 --> 00:29:27,696
Griet is the hardest to please
of all our customers.

219
00:29:27,732 --> 00:29:31,498
Aye, she gets that from me.

220
00:29:33,371 --> 00:29:35,430
There now, I forgot.

221
00:29:35,507 --> 00:29:37,498
We must speak with
Willem Jansson.

222
00:29:37,575 --> 00:29:40,373
Griet, you go on
with Pieter there.

223
00:29:47,585 --> 00:29:49,314
Good morning.
- So Griet...

224
00:29:49,354 --> 00:29:51,788
where is that smile
you owe me,

225
00:29:51,823 --> 00:29:54,485
when I have been so clever
as to track you down?

226
00:29:58,229 --> 00:30:00,129
You had nothing better
to do.

227
00:30:11,109 --> 00:30:13,304
Shocking.
She should know better.

228
00:30:13,344 --> 00:30:14,811
She should at her age.

229
00:30:18,149 --> 00:30:21,710
When I saw you with Tanneke I thought
you were a little Catholic girl.

230
00:30:29,427 --> 00:30:31,452
He started a new painting.

231
00:30:34,199 --> 00:30:35,598
There's no buyer.

232
00:30:35,633 --> 00:30:38,124
He won't even let me see it.

233
00:30:38,203 --> 00:30:40,034
But he's working again.

234
00:30:40,104 --> 00:30:42,402
It usually takes him longer.

235
00:31:27,619 --> 00:31:29,018
Good.

236
00:31:33,024 --> 00:31:36,152
Very good.
Keep it level all the time.

237
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,039
Do you know what it is?

238
00:32:32,116 --> 00:32:33,947
A camera obscura.

239
00:32:48,466 --> 00:32:49,763
Look into the glass.

240
00:33:03,414 --> 00:33:05,382
Here. Put this on.

241
00:33:17,628 --> 00:33:18,959
You can see?

242
00:33:24,702 --> 00:33:27,466
- I'm so sorry, sir.
- No, don't worry about the robe.

243
00:33:27,538 --> 00:33:28,869
What did you see?

244
00:33:32,810 --> 00:33:34,072
I saw the painting.

245
00:33:37,115 --> 00:33:38,139
But...

246
00:33:43,221 --> 00:33:44,950
how did it get in there?

247
00:33:49,127 --> 00:33:50,617
See this?

248
00:33:52,764 --> 00:33:53,890
This is called "a lens."

249
00:33:53,931 --> 00:33:57,458
Beams of reflected light
from that corner pass through it...

250
00:33:58,703 --> 00:34:01,228
into the box...
so that we can see it here.

251
00:34:01,305 --> 00:34:03,136
Is it real?

252
00:34:03,174 --> 00:34:05,404
It's an image.

253
00:34:05,443 --> 00:34:09,072
A picture made of light.

254
00:34:11,149 --> 00:34:13,743
Does the box show you
what to paint?

255
00:34:21,759 --> 00:34:22,851
It helps.

256
00:34:30,134 --> 00:34:33,228
You didn't get me.
I got you.

257
00:34:33,304 --> 00:34:34,669
No, you're cheating.

258
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:36,707
Oh, do we have to play this?

259
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:39,100
So...

260
00:34:40,645 --> 00:34:43,011
Stop it.
Oh, look Cornelia.

261
00:34:43,047 --> 00:34:44,275
There.

262
00:34:45,283 --> 00:34:46,477
Now you're it.

263
00:34:47,518 --> 00:34:49,679
- I've got it.
- I've got it.

264
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:50,709
Yes I can.

265
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:52,154
- No way.
- It's mine.

266
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:54,715
- No.
- I'll catch it.

267
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:56,283
Cornelia!

268
00:35:00,665 --> 00:35:02,132
I won't tell you again.

269
00:35:03,367 --> 00:35:04,493
Girls, come inside.

270
00:35:04,535 --> 00:35:07,561
- Why?
- Come on. Don't make a fuss.

271
00:35:39,770 --> 00:35:41,203
It's dirty now.

272
00:36:56,747 --> 00:36:58,908
- I'm sorry, sir.
- Shh...

273
00:37:06,023 --> 00:37:07,513
Stay.

274
00:37:32,516 --> 00:37:34,279
Lead white.

275
00:37:39,423 --> 00:37:42,221
From the cupboard.

276
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:21,288
Please let me see your hair.

277
00:38:24,201 --> 00:38:25,668
What color is it?

278
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:28,363
Brown.

279
00:38:30,775 --> 00:38:31,764
Straight or curly?

280
00:38:33,878 --> 00:38:35,106
Neither.

281
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:36,875
Long?

282
00:38:36,914 --> 00:38:40,372
- Very long?
- No.

283
00:38:44,622 --> 00:38:46,886
My mother will expect me home.

284
00:38:46,924 --> 00:38:49,415
She knows where you are, Griet.

285
00:39:04,475 --> 00:39:07,171
You're looking at it?

286
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:11,580
Well...

287
00:39:11,615 --> 00:39:14,846
Nothing is the right color.

288
00:39:16,821 --> 00:39:18,220
This is the base color.

289
00:39:18,255 --> 00:39:20,883
It gives the tone...

290
00:39:20,925 --> 00:39:23,553
shadow in the light.

291
00:39:23,594 --> 00:39:25,619
And when it's dry...

292
00:39:25,663 --> 00:39:27,858
I glaze over it with blue, but...

293
00:39:27,898 --> 00:39:30,662
thinly, so that
the black shows through.

294
00:39:40,444 --> 00:39:41,604
Look, Griet.

295
00:39:43,814 --> 00:39:44,974
Look at the clouds.

296
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:50,084
What color are they?

297
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:57,759
White?

298
00:39:59,296 --> 00:40:01,890
No...
not white.

299
00:40:10,374 --> 00:40:11,739
Yellow.

300
00:40:15,346 --> 00:40:18,213
Blue...
and grey.

301
00:40:20,317 --> 00:40:22,285
There are colors
in the clouds.

302
00:40:29,827 --> 00:40:31,795
Now you understand.

303
00:40:54,084 --> 00:40:56,518
Thinking about
your butcher boy?

304
00:41:25,549 --> 00:41:27,039
Come.

305
00:41:29,086 --> 00:41:32,419
This... is ruby shellac.

306
00:41:41,499 --> 00:41:42,864
Gum arabic.

307
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:48,802
Wine skin.

308
00:41:53,744 --> 00:41:55,905
This will make verdigris.

309
00:41:57,748 --> 00:41:59,272
Malachite.

310
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:04,749
Vermilion.

311
00:42:10,928 --> 00:42:12,691
That...

312
00:42:14,398 --> 00:42:15,660
linseed oil.

313
00:42:17,801 --> 00:42:19,029
Bone black.

314
00:42:19,069 --> 00:42:21,970
An you grind it with a muller,
like this.

315
00:42:31,515 --> 00:42:32,743
You try.

316
00:42:47,498 --> 00:42:49,193
Twist from the shoulder.

317
00:42:51,569 --> 00:42:53,127
It's like this.

318
00:43:37,948 --> 00:43:40,508
Griet!

319
00:43:41,385 --> 00:43:42,374
The child needs a draught.

320
00:43:45,489 --> 00:43:48,822
My mother will not be content
till one of them dies from her meanness.

321
00:43:48,859 --> 00:43:49,848
Come on.

322
00:43:49,893 --> 00:43:52,487
You will need...

323
00:44:01,739 --> 00:44:03,434
On the master's account.

324
00:44:17,054 --> 00:44:19,022
- Griet.
- Sir?

325
00:44:20,891 --> 00:44:23,018
I want you to get something
for me, too.

326
00:44:24,294 --> 00:44:25,784
I want some colors.

327
00:44:29,533 --> 00:44:30,898
My wife need not know.

328
00:44:37,041 --> 00:44:39,032
This is too thin.

329
00:46:00,924 --> 00:46:02,391
Did you get the lapis?

330
00:46:06,630 --> 00:46:08,359
You can mix the colors.

331
00:46:10,534 --> 00:46:11,660
Mix the colors?

332
00:46:13,103 --> 00:46:14,764
Sir, I haven't time.

333
00:46:16,306 --> 00:46:18,274
Make time.

334
00:46:49,373 --> 00:46:50,533
Nurse!

335
00:46:50,607 --> 00:46:54,008
- Nurse.
I'm coming.

336
00:46:57,881 --> 00:47:00,816
Nurse! Come on!
Quickly.

337
00:47:32,382 --> 00:47:35,078
How much longer is the wet nurse
to be with us, mistress?

338
00:47:36,220 --> 00:47:37,710
I don't know.

339
00:47:37,754 --> 00:47:39,984
A month or so.

340
00:47:40,023 --> 00:47:42,184
No, Cornelia,
not my pearls.

341
00:47:42,226 --> 00:47:43,818
A month or more.

342
00:47:46,864 --> 00:47:47,853
Why?

343
00:47:47,898 --> 00:47:49,923
What's it to you?

344
00:47:49,967 --> 00:47:52,765
Well, she's eating us out of house
and home for a start.

345
00:47:52,803 --> 00:47:55,294
She must eat for the baby.

346
00:47:55,372 --> 00:47:59,604
All I'm saying is, I can't cook
twice as much and have no sleep at all.

347
00:47:59,643 --> 00:48:01,873
Tell her to be quiet, then.

348
00:48:01,912 --> 00:48:04,278
If I could just go back to the cellar...

349
00:48:04,314 --> 00:48:05,679
Well, you can't.

350
00:48:08,452 --> 00:48:10,181
Griet has your place.

351
00:48:16,793 --> 00:48:18,351
Why not move Tanneke back?

352
00:48:24,101 --> 00:48:26,160
Put a mattress in the attic
for Griet.

353
00:48:26,236 --> 00:48:28,568
Tanneke can sleep soundly...

354
00:48:29,773 --> 00:48:33,004
and Griet can clean the studio
before she comes down in the morning.

355
00:48:37,614 --> 00:48:38,945
My jewels.

356
00:48:41,418 --> 00:48:43,443
You always have my jewels
up there to paint.

357
00:48:44,488 --> 00:48:45,716
She...

358
00:48:47,057 --> 00:48:48,422
You lock up at night,

359
00:48:48,458 --> 00:48:50,323
open it in the morning.

360
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:05,674
There.
Are you satisfied, Tanneke?

361
00:49:05,709 --> 00:49:07,176
Yes, mistress.

362
00:50:34,464 --> 00:50:35,931
Got it.
I win again.

363
00:50:35,966 --> 00:50:37,558
No, we are drawing.

364
00:50:37,601 --> 00:50:39,694
- Well, I do.
- No you don't.

365
00:50:44,274 --> 00:50:46,799
No need to go
to the fish market tomorrow.

366
00:50:46,877 --> 00:50:49,311
Mistress wants eggs.

367
00:50:53,483 --> 00:50:55,110
No...

368
00:50:55,152 --> 00:50:59,054
she cannot abide the smell
when she's with child.

369
00:51:04,127 --> 00:51:05,788
So soon?

370
00:51:05,829 --> 00:51:08,195
As if there weren't enough mouths
to feed already.

371
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:11,189
Still...

372
00:51:12,502 --> 00:51:13,935
what can you do, eh?

373
00:51:15,572 --> 00:51:16,561
Men.

374
00:51:56,613 --> 00:51:58,410
Marvelous.

375
00:52:00,517 --> 00:52:02,781
No, Jan.

376
00:56:09,032 --> 00:56:10,897
Why did you move the chair?

377
00:56:16,940 --> 00:56:18,498
She looked trapped.

378
00:56:39,829 --> 00:56:40,853
Griet!

379
00:56:42,365 --> 00:56:43,923
Are you up there?

380
00:57:01,751 --> 00:57:03,946
One of my tortoiseshell combs
is gone.

381
00:57:17,834 --> 00:57:20,132
She's nothing but trouble.

382
00:57:26,109 --> 00:57:28,407
Master, I did not do it.

383
00:57:32,515 --> 00:57:34,380
Help me.

384
00:57:44,561 --> 00:57:47,121
Please.
Let me look for you.

385
00:57:48,164 --> 00:57:49,290
Papa?

386
00:57:49,332 --> 00:57:51,857
- Father?
Don't!

387
00:57:51,901 --> 00:57:54,028
Leave it alone. I'll find it.
Please, sir.

388
00:57:54,103 --> 00:57:56,264
What's going on?
What are you doing?

389
00:57:59,742 --> 00:58:01,232
Stop it!

390
00:58:01,311 --> 00:58:02,505
For heaven's sake,

391
00:58:02,545 --> 00:58:04,274
you're scaring the children.

392
00:58:07,183 --> 00:58:08,548
What are you doing?

393
00:58:22,599 --> 00:58:24,362
Cornelia.

394
00:58:48,291 --> 00:58:50,020
She's dishonest.

395
00:58:50,059 --> 00:58:52,823
Always sneaking around.
Shirking her work.

396
00:58:55,064 --> 00:58:57,259
Tanneke has complained of it.

397
00:58:57,300 --> 00:58:59,461
Creeping upstairs all day long.

398
00:58:59,502 --> 00:59:04,030
My daughter is right,
there has been too much sneaking about.

399
00:59:04,107 --> 00:59:06,166
I only took her
out of charity.

400
00:59:06,242 --> 00:59:09,177
- If I thought she'd be...
- With another child due

401
00:59:09,212 --> 00:59:10,941
we need the extra help.

402
00:59:11,981 --> 00:59:13,073
Fit in all your work

403
00:59:13,116 --> 00:59:16,574
and do not slack
or it will be the worst for you.

404
00:59:18,121 --> 00:59:20,419
I shall invite Master Van Ruijven.

405
00:59:20,456 --> 00:59:23,425
Johannes must have
a new commission.

406
00:59:25,828 --> 00:59:27,193
Get back to work.

407
00:59:50,186 --> 00:59:52,279
All these girls.

408
00:59:52,322 --> 00:59:55,849
The boys will soon
be swarming around like flies.

409
00:59:55,892 --> 00:59:58,087
I tell you, if I was
a few years younger...

410
00:59:58,127 --> 01:00:01,460
A connoisseur in everything,
Master Van Ruijven.

411
01:00:01,497 --> 01:00:06,696
But you should be faithful
to one mistress above all others...

412
01:00:08,004 --> 01:00:09,596
Art.

413
01:00:09,672 --> 01:00:13,608
Your name will surely be famed
as one of the great patrons.

414
01:00:13,676 --> 01:00:17,009
With your exquisite taste,

415
01:00:17,046 --> 01:00:21,039
your subtle understanding
of allegory and allusion...

416
01:00:21,084 --> 01:00:24,713
No, no, stop it, stop it. My God, woman,
you could sell sour milk to cows.

417
01:00:24,754 --> 01:00:27,188
Now what is it you want?

418
01:00:27,223 --> 01:00:28,781
A group painting.

419
01:00:28,825 --> 01:00:31,385
Yourself and Emilie.

420
01:00:31,427 --> 01:00:33,520
Your lovely daughter too.

421
01:00:35,031 --> 01:00:36,760
Or...

422
01:00:36,799 --> 01:00:39,097
a merry company.

423
01:00:39,135 --> 01:00:40,864
Wine...

424
01:00:40,937 --> 01:00:42,871
a good meal on your table.

425
01:00:42,905 --> 01:00:45,874
Your friends all about.
Music.

426
01:00:45,908 --> 01:00:49,071
- And dancing.
- It's better. Better, better.

427
01:00:49,112 --> 01:00:50,579
I'll take your bait.

428
01:00:50,647 --> 01:00:52,945
The picture, several figures.

429
01:00:52,982 --> 01:00:57,316
A merry gathering,
but no family portrait.

430
01:00:57,353 --> 01:01:02,518
And if I'm to spend
tedious hours sitting

431
01:01:02,558 --> 01:01:06,085
I want something
I can rest my eyes on.

432
01:01:06,129 --> 01:01:08,962
I think she ought to be
in the painting.

433
01:01:09,999 --> 01:01:12,467
A tavern scene.
It will make a change for you.

434
01:01:12,502 --> 01:01:15,403
Griet could come and serve me.

435
01:01:18,074 --> 01:01:19,439
Look at her, man.

436
01:01:19,475 --> 01:01:22,342
How hard is it
to paint a pretty girl?

437
01:01:24,714 --> 01:01:25,976
Can I have her?

438
01:01:58,314 --> 01:02:00,407
Griet, there's been talk
of you.

439
01:02:03,352 --> 01:02:04,649
I've done nothing.

440
01:02:04,687 --> 01:02:09,215
Van Ruijven's cook says
you're to be painted with her master.

441
01:02:09,258 --> 01:02:13,627
You'll have heard about him and the maid
that was painted before?

442
01:02:17,266 --> 01:02:19,996
- You shouldn't believe gossip.
- Oh, I don't.

443
01:02:21,504 --> 01:02:23,529
I'll tell Pieter
you asked after him.

444
01:02:26,175 --> 01:02:27,142
Liver?

445
01:02:27,210 --> 01:02:28,677
Griet.

446
01:02:28,711 --> 01:02:30,406
You've heard?

447
01:02:30,446 --> 01:02:31,572
I heard.

448
01:02:32,882 --> 01:02:35,043
No smoke without fire,
they say.

449
01:02:38,387 --> 01:02:39,786
- Is that what you think?
- No.

450
01:02:41,824 --> 01:02:43,849
You're only a maid,
what can you do?

451
01:02:45,495 --> 01:02:48,089
- I must get back.
- Don't walk away. Listen to me.

452
01:02:51,601 --> 01:02:53,592
Just remember who you are.

453
01:02:55,772 --> 01:02:57,706
Don't get caught up
in his world.

454
01:02:58,775 --> 01:03:00,504
I am only a maid,

455
01:03:00,543 --> 01:03:03,137
but I would never give in
to Master Van Ruijven.

456
01:03:03,179 --> 01:03:04,976
I wasn't talking
about Van Ruijven.

457
01:03:18,161 --> 01:03:19,958
Ah, you girl, Griet.

458
01:03:19,996 --> 01:03:21,554
Come here.

459
01:03:21,597 --> 01:03:24,259
What were you doing today?
I missed you.

460
01:03:26,102 --> 01:03:27,091
We both did.

461
01:03:27,170 --> 01:03:31,630
I hear you've been of great use
to your master, pretty Griet.

462
01:03:31,707 --> 01:03:34,904
All that grinding and stirring, eh?

463
01:03:37,880 --> 01:03:39,541
Master and maid.

464
01:03:39,582 --> 01:03:42,050
It's a tune we all know.

465
01:03:43,619 --> 01:03:47,453
And you can practice together now
that we've made our bargain. Eh, Jan?

466
01:03:49,225 --> 01:03:50,988
You won't forget, will you?

467
01:03:52,662 --> 01:03:53,754
Good.

468
01:04:23,593 --> 01:04:25,720
- What should I...?
- No.

469
01:04:27,697 --> 01:04:31,098
No. I already... already begun
a group painting.

470
01:04:33,803 --> 01:04:36,829
You're not to sit with Master
Van Ruijven, that much is agreed.

471
01:04:39,508 --> 01:04:40,975
Thank you, sir.

472
01:04:44,013 --> 01:04:45,480
I'm to paint you alone.

473
01:05:03,232 --> 01:05:06,793
My daughter must not hear
of this other painting in her condition.

474
01:05:10,873 --> 01:05:13,740
It's to hang
in his private cabinet.

475
01:05:15,878 --> 01:05:17,903
He's no fool,
mind you.

476
01:05:17,947 --> 01:05:21,246
An he won't be taken for one,
so don't think otherwise.

477
01:05:24,053 --> 01:05:26,681
<i>You're a fly in his web.</i>

478
01:05:29,592 --> 01:05:31,685
<i>We all are.</i>

479
01:05:40,269 --> 01:05:43,238
You've to admit, my friend,
French swords are the best.

480
01:05:50,746 --> 01:05:51,713
Tomorrow morning.

481
01:05:53,983 --> 01:05:55,917
I cannot, I have work.

482
01:05:55,952 --> 01:05:58,386
Find a way.

483
01:06:21,744 --> 01:06:23,712
The front of your cap,
fold it back.

484
01:06:42,531 --> 01:06:44,328
Take off your cap.

485
01:06:50,873 --> 01:06:52,306
No, sir.

486
01:06:52,341 --> 01:06:54,206
<i>I cannot.</i>

487
01:06:54,243 --> 01:06:56,973
Cannot?

488
01:06:57,013 --> 01:06:58,480
I will not.

489
01:06:59,515 --> 01:07:01,676
<i>I need to see
your face.</i>

490
01:07:01,717 --> 01:07:03,708
The cap covers too much.

491
01:07:12,661 --> 01:07:14,856
There's some cloth
in the storeroom.

492
01:08:25,101 --> 01:08:28,832
You know, I've a mind to go up there
one day and surprise him

493
01:08:28,904 --> 01:08:30,201
in the act.

494
01:08:33,576 --> 01:08:35,976
But you said yourself
it's very dull.

495
01:08:36,011 --> 01:08:38,343
Oh, not with Emilie

496
01:08:38,380 --> 01:08:41,611
when he's alone with some
young beauty.

497
01:08:43,886 --> 01:08:46,650
Have you ever notice how
he never bothers with old women?

498
01:08:46,689 --> 01:08:49,522
Only the young pretty ones.

499
01:08:49,558 --> 01:08:51,219
On their own.

500
01:08:51,260 --> 01:08:53,023
You'll have to wait then.

501
01:08:55,331 --> 01:08:57,526
He makes only one painting
at a time.

502
01:08:58,567 --> 01:09:00,501
<i>Is that so?</i>

503
01:09:45,114 --> 01:09:46,240
<i>Jan?</i>

504
01:09:48,617 --> 01:09:51,450
Jan?
My necklace.

505
01:10:36,899 --> 01:10:39,094
Haven't you finished yet?

506
01:10:52,881 --> 01:10:54,610
I'll be in my studio
until dinner.

507
01:11:08,230 --> 01:11:09,959
Open your mouth.

508
01:11:13,636 --> 01:11:15,263
Sir?

509
01:11:15,337 --> 01:11:17,032
Open your mouth.

510
01:11:21,577 --> 01:11:22,737
Less.

511
01:11:26,448 --> 01:11:28,643
Now lick your lips.

512
01:11:41,063 --> 01:11:42,428
Again.

513
01:12:01,183 --> 01:12:02,741
Again.

514
01:12:07,122 --> 01:12:08,885
Got you, got you, got you!

515
01:12:41,990 --> 01:12:43,855
Wear these.

516
01:12:59,408 --> 01:13:00,739
Good.

517
01:13:12,054 --> 01:13:13,248
Look, Griet.

518
01:13:14,890 --> 01:13:17,620
Point of light in the shadow of the neck
leading the eye.

519
01:13:17,659 --> 01:13:18,648
Jan.

520
01:13:27,302 --> 01:13:28,667
Sir.

521
01:13:28,737 --> 01:13:31,797
- Do not ask this of me.
- It's needed.

522
01:13:31,874 --> 01:13:34,206
The composition,
it's not balanced.

523
01:13:34,243 --> 01:13:36,177
I've seen you paint
with no one there.

524
01:13:36,211 --> 01:13:38,475
You want me to imagine
how the earring would look?

525
01:13:38,514 --> 01:13:40,175
My ears are not pierced.

526
01:13:48,891 --> 01:13:51,189
She'll find out.

527
01:13:57,099 --> 01:13:58,828
This has to be, Griet.

528
01:14:01,136 --> 01:14:02,626
See for yourself.

529
01:14:20,389 --> 01:14:22,755
You looked inside me.

530
01:15:21,884 --> 01:15:23,249
I've got you!

531
01:15:25,053 --> 01:15:27,749
Now hold still.
I want to look at you.

532
01:15:29,424 --> 01:15:30,652
Now, girl...

533
01:15:30,692 --> 01:15:34,184
tell me how you get on
up there.

534
01:15:34,229 --> 01:15:36,595
Has he found his composition?

535
01:15:36,632 --> 01:15:39,658
Do you move him?
Do you inspire him?

536
01:15:39,701 --> 01:15:44,001
Tell me, has the master's brush
unlocked the secrets of your heart?

537
01:15:48,377 --> 01:15:51,369
Ripe as a plum...
still unplucked.

538
01:15:51,446 --> 01:15:53,243
What's he playing at?

539
01:15:54,249 --> 01:15:58,549
He made a bargain with me.
He's painting you at my pleasure.

540
01:16:04,026 --> 01:16:07,518
- No!
- I've waited long enough.

541
01:16:07,563 --> 01:16:10,191
What a great fool he is.

542
01:16:11,533 --> 01:16:13,262
Don't fight.

543
01:16:19,007 --> 01:16:20,133
No! No!

544
01:16:20,208 --> 01:16:22,005
<i>Griet?</i>

545
01:16:25,714 --> 01:16:28,205
Not a word.

546
01:16:28,250 --> 01:16:30,377
You'll lose your place.

547
01:16:33,889 --> 01:16:35,686
He won't look at you again.

548
01:16:36,892 --> 01:16:38,257
<i>Griet!</i>

549
01:16:41,530 --> 01:16:43,327
Ah, there you are, my dear.

550
01:16:43,365 --> 01:16:46,493
The maid
kept me talking with some...

551
01:16:46,535 --> 01:16:48,435
cock and bull story.

552
01:17:29,211 --> 01:17:30,508
Well, girl?

553
01:17:32,681 --> 01:17:34,239
What's to be done?

554
01:17:35,717 --> 01:17:38,208
Master Van Ruijven
wants his paintings...

555
01:17:38,253 --> 01:17:40,278
and he will bear no more delay.

556
01:17:42,057 --> 01:17:44,548
If he crosses Van Ruijven over this...

557
01:17:44,593 --> 01:17:46,686
he will lose him.

558
01:17:46,728 --> 01:17:48,889
Then what?

559
01:18:15,323 --> 01:18:16,915
My daughter is out for the day.

560
01:18:19,695 --> 01:18:21,629
Do it now.

561
01:19:10,979 --> 01:19:12,446
You do it.

562
01:20:59,120 --> 01:21:00,417
Look at me.

563
01:21:00,455 --> 01:21:02,719
Now turn your head,
not your shoulders.

564
01:21:05,026 --> 01:21:06,493
Look at me.

565
01:21:12,234 --> 01:21:13,701
There, that's it.

566
01:22:22,904 --> 01:22:24,064
I'll see you later.

567
01:23:15,357 --> 01:23:17,154
Don't rush away,
Griet, please.

568
01:23:20,328 --> 01:23:22,228
Leave the house.

569
01:23:22,263 --> 01:23:25,130
Join me and Paul
in the meat market.

570
01:23:25,166 --> 01:23:26,895
- I must get back.
- I'll fetch your things,

571
01:23:26,935 --> 01:23:28,300
I'll send someone.

572
01:23:28,370 --> 01:23:29,860
No.

573
01:23:29,938 --> 01:23:34,773
Our own life, Griet...
answering to no one.

574
01:23:36,544 --> 01:23:38,409
Marry me.

575
01:24:53,455 --> 01:24:55,218
<i>Laughing at me
in my own house.</i>

576
01:24:55,256 --> 01:24:58,817
<i>I will see for myself.
No one will stop me.</i>

577
01:24:58,860 --> 01:25:01,351
<i>There is nothing to see.
You're making yourself ridiculous.</i>

578
01:25:01,396 --> 01:25:02,488
<i>Calm, my dear.</i>

579
01:25:02,530 --> 01:25:05,055
<i>I will not be calm!</i>

580
01:25:05,100 --> 01:25:06,795
<i>Am I a child?!</i>

581
01:25:07,936 --> 01:25:10,166
Does no one speak the truth to me
in my own house?

582
01:25:10,238 --> 01:25:13,730
By all the saints, if you would stop
screaming for a moment, I can explain.

583
01:25:13,808 --> 01:25:14,934
More lies?!

584
01:25:15,009 --> 01:25:18,445
I don't want to hear
any more of your lies, Mother.

585
01:25:18,513 --> 01:25:20,981
I have a right to know.

586
01:25:29,591 --> 01:25:31,081
So.

587
01:25:33,962 --> 01:25:35,691
No more hiding now.

588
01:25:35,730 --> 01:25:37,891
Here I am.

589
01:25:39,367 --> 01:25:41,767
I want to see this painting.

590
01:25:44,372 --> 01:25:46,169
There's no point.

591
01:25:46,241 --> 01:25:48,675
No point?!

592
01:25:50,478 --> 01:25:53,641
I am too stupid to look
at a painting now?

593
01:25:56,918 --> 01:26:00,217
She can't read!
You know that?

594
01:26:00,255 --> 01:26:02,780
Sit down.
You'll exhaust yourself.

595
01:26:02,824 --> 01:26:03,882
Why can't I look?

596
01:26:03,925 --> 01:26:07,019
It's just a commission. Gone
in a few days. You need never see it.

597
01:26:10,565 --> 01:26:12,123
They are just paintings.

598
01:26:12,167 --> 01:26:15,694
Pictures, for money.
They mean nothing.

599
01:26:24,612 --> 01:26:27,410
Is it true she wore my pearls?

600
01:26:35,557 --> 01:26:37,582
How could you?

601
01:26:41,696 --> 01:26:43,288
How could you?

602
01:26:54,042 --> 01:26:55,907
Show me this painting.

603
01:26:55,944 --> 01:26:57,809
You'll make yourself ill.

604
01:26:57,845 --> 01:26:59,745
You show me.

605
01:27:27,642 --> 01:27:29,610
It's obscene.

606
01:27:40,722 --> 01:27:42,849
Why don't you paint me?

607
01:27:42,890 --> 01:27:44,482
Because you don't understand!

608
01:27:45,526 --> 01:27:47,585
And she does?

609
01:28:15,423 --> 01:28:18,790
No!
Get out of here!

610
01:28:23,865 --> 01:28:25,958
Get out of my house!

611
01:31:56,310 --> 01:31:58,039
I've come
to the right place, then.

612
01:31:58,079 --> 01:31:59,410
Tanneke?

613
01:32:04,018 --> 01:32:05,645
This is for you.

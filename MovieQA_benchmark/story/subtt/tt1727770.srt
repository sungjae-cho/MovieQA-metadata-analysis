1
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:13,199
Thirty seconds and counting.

2
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:15,003
<i>Power transfer is complete.</i>

3
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:18,562
<i>We're on internal power
with the launch vehicle at this time.</i>

4
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,768
<i>T minus 20 seconds and counting.</i>

5
00:00:20,839 --> 00:00:23,047
<i>All the second-stage tanks now pressurized.</i>

6
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:25,850
<i>T minus 15 seconds. Guidance is internal.</i>

7
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:29,689
<i>Twelve, eleven, ten,</i> 9...

8
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:32,003
<i>Ignition sequence starts.</i>

9
00:00:32,679 --> 00:00:37,527
<i>Six, five, four, three, two, one,</i>

10
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,362
<i>zero. All engines running.</i>

11
00:00:41,119 --> 00:00:43,281
<i>Lift off! We have a lift off.</i>

12
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,567
And so in <i>1972,</i>

13
00:00:46,039 --> 00:00:49,521
<i>the Atlas Centaur rocket
blasted off from our planet,</i>

14
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:53,124
a <i>four-stage rocket that launched</i> a <i>probe</i>

15
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:55,247
<i>way out into the blackness of space.</i>

16
00:00:55,719 --> 00:00:58,006
<i>The probe would use the energy from the sun</i>

17
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:01,209
<i>and the gravitational pull
of our neighbouring planets</i>

18
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,770
<i>to cross our solar system.</i>

19
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,246
<i>That momentum would then carry it on</i>

20
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:07,686
<i>into the farthest reaches of the universe.</i>

21
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:12,400
<i>The mission, to find intelligent life
similar to ours</i>

22
00:01:13,159 --> 00:01:15,128
<i>out there in deep space.</i>

23
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:19,043
<i>The probe carried a tablet
which had inscribed on it</i>

24
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,646
<i>the image of us humans, a man and a woman,</i>

25
00:01:21,719 --> 00:01:23,403
<i>and a map to locate us in the universe.</i>

26
00:01:24,439 --> 00:01:28,843
<i>Stage four disconnects and our probe
is fired on its long journey.</i>

27
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,561
<i>The world wished it bon voyage</i>

28
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:34,765
<i>and may it find a friend out there</i>

29
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,524
<i>in deep space.</i>

30
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,603
Thank you so much. Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you.

31
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,805
Hey! Thank you very much. Thank you.

32
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,479
Thank you, nice to see you.

33
00:03:30,199 --> 00:03:32,168
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.

34
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:34,765
When I interviewed Neil Clarke
for The Book Programme,

35
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,409
I knew he was extraordinary.

36
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:40,290
Now, with the publication
of his brilliant novel,

37
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,248
reviewers agree he's joined the ranks

38
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:44,003
of Britain's immortals.

39
00:03:44,079 --> 00:03:45,569
Ladies and gentlemen, Neil Clarke.

40
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:55,811
Um, so I suppose I wanted to start off
by asking you

41
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:59,811
how did you manage such amazing
insight into the soul of modern man

42
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:02,531
and how do you know
what men and women really want,

43
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:07,046
just really the whole relationship
between humanity and the cosmos?

44
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,250
Yeah, well, I think I
probably achieved that

45
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,006
by looking into my own soul, Catherine.

46
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,807
Um, I studied its flaws,

47
00:04:15,879 --> 00:04:18,406
its potential, its urgent needs.

48
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,000
I listened to its cries for help...

49
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:26,209
and its yelps of anguish and, um, I...

50
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:29,249
I spent five long years

51
00:04:29,319 --> 00:04:34,007
in a book which I hoped would throw open
the doors of human perception

52
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:37,925
and allow us to be engulfed
in a sense of our own futility.

53
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,124
Sorry about this, it's...

54
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:45,521
Get off! Down!

55
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:49,411
Ah!

56
00:04:53,319 --> 00:04:54,889
Oh, God.

57
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,206
Go watch TV.

58
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:02,129
Your dog is barking.

59
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:04,447
My dog was barking
because you rang the doorbell.

60
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,288
I rang the doorbell
because your dog was barking.

61
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,603
Your lease says no pets.

62
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,887
Well, he is a guide dog.

63
00:05:14,279 --> 00:05:15,406
You're not blind.

64
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:18,050
I prefer the term "optically challenged".

65
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:22,043
You're not optically challenged, either.

66
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:24,247
Fiona, you live, like, three floors up.
I mean, I don't...

67
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:27,846
If you don't
control your bloody dog,

68
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:31,288
I am going to get it sent
to Battersea Dogs Home. Right?

69
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:33,365
- Hmm?
- All right.

70
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:37,759
Come on, Dennis,
let's go and evacuate your bowels.

71
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:41,240
Come on, Dennis.

72
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,768
Come on.

73
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,204
- Hi, Neil.
- Hi, Catherine.

74
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,648
Hey, it's funny, I was
just dreaming about you.

75
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,365
Really?

76
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:58,646
Yeah, you were presenting me
with an award for my novel.

77
00:05:59,079 --> 00:06:00,206
Oh, did you deserve it?

78
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,608
Well, I was proud but humble.

79
00:06:03,399 --> 00:06:05,322
Have you finished it,
actually, in real life?

80
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:08,088
Absolutely, almost, yeah.

81
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,480
Cos last spring you were on chapter...

82
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,880
Yeah, I've renumbered them.
In fact, I've removed them.

83
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:14,040
- Oh.
- Yeah.

84
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:16,646
I find the whole concept of chapters
just gets in the way so...

85
00:06:17,399 --> 00:06:19,641
Yeah. Yeah, no, I can see that.

86
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:23,649
I want reading it to be like being
sucked into a giant vortex, you know.

87
00:06:24,519 --> 00:06:27,444
- Like going on Facebook.
- Like Facebook, yeah.

88
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,805
That's a good one.

89
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,800
"Like being sucked into a giant vortex."

90
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:38,521
Dennis, why do you let me
say things like this, hey?

91
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,805
Come on.

92
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:47,404
Hmm. Mmm?

93
00:07:47,959 --> 00:07:49,610
Ah.

94
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:20,882
- Come on, Ray. It's only 20 quid.
- No, I can't, Neil.

95
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:22,199
- Yeah, but it can't lose.
- No.

96
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,966
Look, I guarantee you
a 50% return on your money

97
00:08:25,079 --> 00:08:26,411
before the end of classes today.

98
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:32,090
So when do you make your move on
Miss Booker Prize downstairs, then?

99
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:36,370
Oh, I don't. Turns out she's a bit
literal-minded, no foresight.

100
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,966
Whereas me,
I can see for miles into the future.

101
00:08:39,759 --> 00:08:41,524
A man needs a woman, Neil.

102
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:44,284
- I've got Dennis.
- Dennis is male.

103
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,048
And he's a dog, in case you hadn't noticed.

104
00:08:48,919 --> 00:08:51,240
Yeah, well, I don't want
to complicate my life.

105
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:52,566
This is a tenner!

106
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,846
Walk!

107
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:19,725
<i>Accessing representative images
of earthlings.</i>

108
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:42,130
Communication will be carried on in the
language of the species to be judged.

109
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,850
I'm sorry, I'm not understanding.

110
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:48,841
Ah.

111
00:09:48,919 --> 00:09:51,844
- Is that better, Kylie?
- Understanding you now, Sharon.

112
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,528
By the power invested in me by the
Intergalactic Council of Superior Species,

113
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:00,605
I hereby pronounce
a destruction order on the planet Earth.

114
00:10:00,679 --> 00:10:04,889
With great respect, Sharon,
we should not pronounce a destruction order

115
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,522
before we've given these earthlings
a chance to prove themselves.

116
00:10:08,759 --> 00:10:11,490
They've penetrated
intergalactic space.

117
00:10:11,559 --> 00:10:12,799
Maureen is right.

118
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:16,004
They're clearly not a superior species.

119
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:19,330
Look at the way they copulate.

120
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:22,280
If these earthlings

121
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:26,409
can convince us that they are superior
beings, then they may join our society.

122
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:28,408
If they cannot, we must eliminate them,

123
00:10:28,519 --> 00:10:32,081
for the moral well-being of the entire
Intergalactic Community.

124
00:10:32,159 --> 00:10:34,082
Thank you for explaining it to me, Sharon.

125
00:10:34,159 --> 00:10:35,321
Not at all, Miss Barker.

126
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,803
No, Grant, I don't want to talk to you.

127
00:10:40,879 --> 00:10:42,722
No, I don't want to see you, either.

128
00:10:42,799 --> 00:10:45,120
We had a great time last
summer but it's over.

129
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,931
What part of over do you not understand?

130
00:10:48,039 --> 00:10:49,690
Thank you for calling. Goodbye.

131
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,966
These questions of yours
make it sound as if I thought

132
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,407
this bloody author
can string two words together.

133
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:59,086
But he can. It's a wonderful book.

134
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:02,129
Darling, didn't you read the memo?
We're doing a demolition job.

135
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,850
But it's the best thing he's ever written.
Everyone says so.

136
00:11:05,919 --> 00:11:08,321
That's why we have to pee on it
from a great height.

137
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:13,450
I want ten new questions,
please, before noon.

138
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:22,282
Don't you know? She never reads the books.
She hates books.

139
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:25,370
Why is she presenting
a book programme, then?

140
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,965
I spy trouble. Just...

141
00:11:29,759 --> 00:11:33,162
Look, Catherine, you may despise her ego,

142
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:35,720
but that's what people tune in to see.

143
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:38,844
Not books, not authors, God forbid,

144
00:11:39,879 --> 00:11:42,928
but Fenella's rampant, pulsating,
sexually arousing ego.

145
00:11:43,159 --> 00:11:46,447
No, I think people watch because
it's a book programme and they love books.

146
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,169
Books are finished.

147
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:52,721
Our job is to provide scandal, gossip
and character assassination,

148
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:55,326
with a thin veneer of
literary respectability.

149
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,408
Oh, so we're not just selling out, then?
We've sold out?

150
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,527
Exactly.

151
00:12:00,879 --> 00:12:02,484
For God's sake, smile.

152
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:28,088
It's enough to make you weep, isn't it?

153
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,486
What?

154
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:34,650
The price of pickles.
Don't even look at the marinated herring.

155
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,245
Honestly, you'd be suicidal.

156
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,566
I didn't want them, anyway.

157
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,040
Thanks.

158
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:51,120
Um, I also offer support and counselling
on dips, dried fruit and pasta sauces.

159
00:12:54,679 --> 00:12:56,330
She's gone.

160
00:13:01,879 --> 00:13:04,451
- The usual test, Sharon?
- The usual test, Kylie.

161
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:07,485
One earthling will be chosen randomly,

162
00:13:07,759 --> 00:13:11,081
as defined by
the Intergalactic Manual of Good and Evil.

163
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:13,004
Page 56. paragraph B.

164
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,568
Uh, page 56, paragraph D.

165
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,009
Uh, right.

166
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:24,246
To prove that they understand
the difference between good and evil.

167
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,328
How will they prove it?

168
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:29,528
They will be given the power
that all superior beings have.

169
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,570
The earthling will be capable
of doing absolutely anything.

170
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:36,441
What if he uses his power for evil?

171
00:13:37,039 --> 00:13:39,691
The Earth will be eliminated.

172
00:13:39,759 --> 00:13:41,330
But if he uses it for good?

173
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:44,244
Then we welcome them
to the Intergalactic Community.

174
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,559
Are we ready, gentlemen?

175
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:49,130
<i>Commencing random
selection of earthlings.</i>

176
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,811
<i>Processing...</i>

177
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,400
<i>Processing...</i>

178
00:13:55,399 --> 00:13:56,639
<i>Earthling.</i>

179
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,440
Jolly good!

180
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,086
Wait!

181
00:14:00,159 --> 00:14:01,399
<i>Selected.</i>

182
00:14:04,559 --> 00:14:08,769
The earthling has ten days to prove
he can use absolute power for good

183
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:11,001
rather than for evil.

184
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,280
God.

185
00:14:30,879 --> 00:14:31,961
FUCK you!

186
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:47,323
All they want me to do is help them
sneer at people who write wonderful books.

187
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:50,727
Well, my producer just wants me
to dig up dirt on Amenhotep Ill.

188
00:14:51,799 --> 00:14:54,201
I keep telling them he had a kind nature

189
00:14:54,279 --> 00:14:55,405
and lovely hands.

190
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:59,489
I would have loved to spend
an evening with Amenhotep Ill.

191
00:14:59,559 --> 00:15:03,006
Yeah, except he's been dead
4,000 years, Rosie,

192
00:15:03,039 --> 00:15:05,725
and he'd spend all day long
talking about embalming.

193
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,841
Well, find me a good one
that's still breathing.

194
00:15:07,879 --> 00:15:09,847
Tell me about it.

195
00:15:09,919 --> 00:15:11,365
What about Grant?

196
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:14,886
Oh, well, Colonel Grant
turned out to have issues.

197
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:17,769
- Issues?
- Yeah, like being clinically insane.

198
00:15:18,279 --> 00:15:19,610
Shame.

199
00:15:19,679 --> 00:15:21,169
Maybe that's overstating it.

200
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:25,289
Uh, just obsessive, possessive
and pathologically jealous.

201
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,206
What about him upstairs?

202
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:31,287
Oh, he tried to cheer me up
in the supermarket.

203
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,963
Oh, so he's gay?

204
00:15:33,039 --> 00:15:34,201
What?

205
00:15:34,879 --> 00:15:38,168
Well, he's sympathetic,
interested, available.

206
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:42,610
- That's the way life works.
- No, he's not gay.

207
00:15:42,799 --> 00:15:46,168
He's... very likeable.

208
00:16:10,159 --> 00:16:12,003
Mr Clarke.

209
00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:15,201
Hi.

210
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:18,125
This is the twelfth time
you've been late this month, Mr Clarke.

211
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,644
Yeah, I got knocked off my bike.

212
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:24,202
Yesterday you had food poisoning.
Friday you thought it was Saturday.

213
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:27,245
Monday you forgot to put
your clock forward.

214
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,366
Oh, everybody does that.

215
00:16:28,519 --> 00:16:32,490
Week last Wednesday it seems you had
an appointment with the Dalai Lama.

216
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:34,129
Yeah, I showed you the picture.

217
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:37,683
That had Michael Jackson in it as well.

218
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,799
Well, he's a great man.

219
00:16:40,279 --> 00:16:43,010
Great enough to appear in photographs
when he's dead.

220
00:16:44,279 --> 00:16:47,328
You, Mr Clarke, are totally irresponsible,

221
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,409
you are idle and you are feckless.

222
00:16:50,879 --> 00:16:52,005
Feckless?

223
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,567
Yes, you are without feck.

224
00:16:57,679 --> 00:16:59,443
If I could replace you, I would.

225
00:17:02,759 --> 00:17:04,364
Yeah, well, so would I.

226
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:07,364
I just don't have anybody
to replace me with.

227
00:17:30,759 --> 00:17:32,523
You a big skier?

228
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,165
Well, I've had my moments.

229
00:17:36,119 --> 00:17:37,359
Hello, gorgeous.

230
00:17:37,519 --> 00:17:41,080
How about cocktails for two this evening?
Go halves?

231
00:17:41,599 --> 00:17:43,328
Drop dead, Ray.

232
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:46,403
All right. Think about
it and get back to me.

233
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:50,560
Knob.

234
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,641
- Neil?
- Yeah.

235
00:17:53,359 --> 00:17:54,805
If you could do anything,
what would you do?

236
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:59,203
Hello, Neil, love.
Tinned mouse or fricassee of war victim?

237
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:01,726
I will have the roast headmaster,
please, Mrs B.

238
00:18:01,799 --> 00:18:03,131
You are a one.

239
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:06,643
- There you go.
- Thank you.

240
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:10,486
Uh, I'll have the casserole, please, Mrs B.

241
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:16,928
You'll enjoy that, Mr Ray.
As long as you don't eat it.

242
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,690
No, I mean, if you could
make anything you want happen,

243
00:18:25,759 --> 00:18:27,204
what would it be?

244
00:18:27,279 --> 00:18:30,250
I would make Dennis regurgitate
my notes from chapter three.

245
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,800
If you could make
something impossible happen.

246
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,690
Intact.

247
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,003
What if you could make someone
worship the ground you walked on?

248
00:18:47,279 --> 00:18:49,964
What, even if she thought
you were a little shit?

249
00:18:50,039 --> 00:18:51,121
Come on, Ray.

250
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,599
That would be taking an unfair advantage
of an innocent girl.

251
00:18:54,119 --> 00:18:57,363
OK, but suppose
there was one thing you could do

252
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,160
that would change your life for the better?

253
00:18:59,519 --> 00:19:01,965
Oh, that's easy.
I would make alien spaceships destroy 10C.

254
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,721
That sounded like it was in the school.

255
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:15,720
Out of the way! Out of the way!

256
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:17,365
Stand back, stand back.
Stand back, stand back.

257
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,645
Now, just stay calm.

258
00:19:23,759 --> 00:19:25,171
Oh, my God!

259
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,605
Who was that?

260
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:35,759
It was the Salubrious Gat
of Galaxy G946 WOT.

261
00:19:38,279 --> 00:19:39,849
Gat, what do you think you're doing?

262
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,444
<i>Just practicing, Sharon.</i>

263
00:19:41,839 --> 00:19:46,209
We haven't done the judicial review yet.
We may not want to destroy this species.

264
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:47,885
<i>Who are you kidding?</i>

265
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:53,648
<i>445,349,722 new alien species encountered.</i>

266
00:19:54,119 --> 00:19:55,405
<i>Number granted membership</i>

267
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:58,289
<i>of the Intergalactic Community
of Superior Beings?</i>

268
00:19:58,599 --> 00:19:59,681
<i>Zero.</i>

269
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,486
We have high standards.

270
00:20:01,759 --> 00:20:03,125
<i>You know you're going to wipe them out.</i>

271
00:20:03,319 --> 00:20:05,163
It all depends on the earthling.

272
00:20:06,519 --> 00:20:09,682
<i>And signs</i> of a recovery
seem as far away <i>as</i> ever.

273
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,970
Hey-

274
00:20:18,039 --> 00:20:19,121
Hello, Dennis.

275
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,846
Oh, Dennis. Couldn't you have waited?

276
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:27,121
<i>We can now go live
to our reporter Brenda Emmanus</i>

277
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,769
<i>at the scene of the incident.</i>

278
00:20:29,079 --> 00:20:32,049
<i>It was here
at Kinbrook Comprehensive School</i>

279
00:20:32,519 --> 00:20:35,410
<i>that an explosion killed 38 pupils.</i>

280
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:39,520
<i>A police spokesman said they
could not rule out a terrorist attack</i>

281
00:20:39,599 --> 00:20:41,401
<i>but say there were no
connections with reports</i>

282
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,284
<i>of</i> a <i>UFO sighting in the</i> area.

283
00:20:44,359 --> 00:20:45,805
<i>The head teacher, Mr Robert...</i>

284
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:52,443
Oh, sure, Dennis, it was
an alien spaceship.

285
00:20:53,839 --> 00:20:55,842
What are you talking about?

286
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:58,041
If I could make
an alien spaceship destroy 10C,

287
00:20:58,119 --> 00:21:00,520
then I wouldn't be farting around
with this, would I?

288
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:01,924
I'd just say,

289
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,650
"Dog mess, clean yourself up."

290
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,611
See?

291
00:21:42,319 --> 00:21:43,480
It's just shock.

292
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:47,088
It's just post-hallucination shock.
That's all it is.

293
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:54,848
I mean, it couldn't have been
an alien spaceship, Dennis, could it?

294
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:58,066
I mean, it just, I
mean, it couldn't have.

295
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:00,641
Oh, my God.

296
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,405
That's my notes.

297
00:22:09,599 --> 00:22:12,079
Ah, damn it!

298
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:22,164
Whisky, go back in the bottle.

299
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,480
See? You see? There's nothing.
It's nothing.

300
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,963
There was nothing. It's nothing.

301
00:22:30,039 --> 00:22:31,529
Whisky, go back in the bottle.

302
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:39,925
Oh, my God.

303
00:22:41,759 --> 00:22:43,329
I have to wave my hand.

304
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:58,608
Whisky, exchange yourself
for another bottle, a single malt.

305
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:02,844
Hey, come back!

306
00:23:24,119 --> 00:23:25,326
Door, open quick.

307
00:23:27,079 --> 00:23:28,411
Not that quick.

308
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:32,450
I didn't mean go back to the shop
to get exchanged!

309
00:23:38,519 --> 00:23:39,681
It's closed.

310
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:44,127
Oh, shit.

311
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:53,288
- Gotcha!
- Help me, Dennis!

312
00:23:53,359 --> 00:23:54,645
- Priority.
- Help me!

313
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:09,131
Shh, Dennis, be quiet.

314
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:11,520
Oh, shit.

315
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,559
All right, laddie. You're nicked.

316
00:24:24,759 --> 00:24:26,523
Me be at home having dinner with Dennis.

317
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,881
Oh, yuck! Chumzy!

318
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:41,487
You say one word about this, Constable,
you'll be on community relations.

319
00:24:48,279 --> 00:24:49,930
Oh, my God. 10C!

320
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:01,082
Uh, let everyone who died be alive again.

321
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:31,119
Oh, God.

322
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:36,487
Oh, no. No, no, no, no. No, I meant
everybody in 10C be alive again!

323
00:25:37,319 --> 00:25:40,324
Obviously. Not everyone who's died ever.
Are you crazy?

324
00:25:45,799 --> 00:25:46,961
Shit. Shit.

325
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:49,645
And everybody who died in
the bomb blast that is alive again,

326
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:50,965
be completely uninjured.

327
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:53,050
Oh, shit, shit, shit!

328
00:25:53,319 --> 00:25:56,563
Uh, OK, me feel better.

329
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,205
Oh, that's better.

330
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:01,164
Me have a really good idea
about what to do next.

331
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:02,401
Oh, that's a good idea.

332
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:05,090
Um, let the explosion never have happened.

333
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:08,163
No, I mean, if you could make
anything you wanted happen,

334
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,042
what would it be?

335
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:12,240
I'm sorry, what?

336
00:26:12,839 --> 00:26:14,682
If you could do anything,
what would you do?

337
00:26:16,079 --> 00:26:19,242
That's very weird.
I think I just dreamt that I could.

338
00:26:19,319 --> 00:26:20,366
What?

339
00:26:20,519 --> 00:26:23,329
Do anything. I dreamt that I could just
wave my hand and say such-and-such

340
00:26:23,359 --> 00:26:24,486
and it would happen.

341
00:26:24,839 --> 00:26:25,921
So what did you do?

342
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,843
I made alien spaceships destroy 10C.

343
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,080
Good thinking.

344
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:33,046
I would make Dorothy Pringle
worship the ground I walked on.

345
00:26:33,559 --> 00:26:36,165
You wouldn't be so cruel.

348
00:26:46,039 --> 00:26:47,848
<i>and authors get what's coming to them.</i>

349
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:51,884
<i>What's the truth under publishers' blurbs?</i>

350
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:55,891
<i>Why do writers' photographs always
show them looking ten years younger?</i>

351
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:58,526
<i>You've come to the right place to find out.</i>

352
00:26:58,599 --> 00:27:01,443
<i>Our first guest tonight
is Mortimer Stanley,</i>

353
00:27:01,519 --> 00:27:05,888
<i>whose latest novel is entitled
What You See With Your Eyes Open.</i>

354
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:10,201
Mortimer, your last novel
was published nearly ten years ago.

355
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:14,564
It got what they call "mixed reviews"
and sold fewer than 3,000 copies.

356
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,721
What possessed you to write another one?

357
00:27:17,759 --> 00:27:19,728
Well, my wife was dying.

358
00:27:20,119 --> 00:27:21,644
You were estranged, weren't you?

359
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:25,769
Well, yes, but on her deathbed,
she urged me to write another book.

360
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,404
Knowing that she would
never have to read it?

361
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,487
Well...

362
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:32,441
Fenella's complaining that you didn't tell
her about his shoplifting conviction.

363
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:35,926
Well, he was 14, James.
It's got nothing to do with his book.

364
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:37,723
Well, neither has the show, Cath.

365
00:27:37,839 --> 00:27:41,083
Listen, what upsets Fenella about you
is your integrity.

366
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,968
But me, I quite like it.

367
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:48,609
Play your cards right,
you could get your own office

368
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,085
with a bigger desk and a view.

369
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:53,961
Um...

370
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:59,603
Sorry. Excuse me one second.

371
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:02,721
Mind you, you've gotta
play your cards right.

372
00:28:03,799 --> 00:28:05,211
What the hell are you doing here?

373
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:07,601
- Don't I get a kiss?
- Please go away.

374
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,330
That wouldn't be fair to you, Cath.

375
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:13,161
This is a wonderful opportunity
for you to get to know the real me.

376
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:14,849
Well... I'm calling security.

377
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:17,440
No, not just the charming,
high-flying military strategist.

378
00:28:17,519 --> 00:28:19,442
Hello, security?

379
00:28:19,519 --> 00:28:21,361
Not the inventor of extreme
rendition, either.

380
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,488
Yes, I've got an intruder in room 405.

381
00:28:23,599 --> 00:28:27,490
Or the mastermind behind
warrantless domestic surveillance.

382
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:31,442
Just a humble officer who adores you.

383
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:36,644
OK, Grant, I appreciate that you like me...

384
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:40,884
Like? Like? What do you think,
I'm one of these cardboard cut-outs?

385
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:45,204
Like? No. No, no, no. Adulate. Worship.

386
00:28:46,519 --> 00:28:48,840
OK, well, I don't adulate or worship you.

387
00:28:49,319 --> 00:28:50,730
I don't even really like you.

388
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:53,724
So that's why I'm asking you
to just go away and leave me alone.

389
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:58,368
- So there's some hope?
- No, no, no. There's no hope.

390
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,651
Cath, I came all the way to England
to see you.

391
00:29:01,759 --> 00:29:03,523
Doesn't that show you
how much I care about you?

392
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:07,166
No, it shows me that you're obsessed.
Obsession's not a quality that I admire.

393
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:08,480
Really?

394
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:11,321
I think the lady wants you to go, Colonel.

395
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,209
You work for the BBC, don't you?

396
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,205
I do.

397
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:24,246
You know who ultimately controls
the British Broadcasting Corporation?

398
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,362
A little guy that used to work
down the hall from me

399
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,402
at Fort Bragg, North Carolina.

400
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:34,048
And he did it in his spare time.

401
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:40,769
I'll catch you later, honey.

402
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:51,364
It was a party. I was doing a documentary.
I was drunk.

403
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:53,250
Judging me.

404
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:04,049
Oh, God.

405
00:30:15,079 --> 00:30:19,482
Let 10C become a model class,
kind and considerate.

406
00:30:19,559 --> 00:30:20,799
Oh, and eager to learn.

407
00:30:32,079 --> 00:30:35,606
- Good afternoon, 10C.
- Good afternoon, Mr Clarke.

408
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:41,322
Um, could you all turn to page 73,
please, and read the entire chapter?

409
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,488
- What, the whole chapter?
- Yes.

410
00:30:43,599 --> 00:30:45,967
- Oh, good.
- How exciting!

411
00:30:46,079 --> 00:30:47,844
He's letting us read the whole chapter!

412
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:50,527
- Great.
- Well, you get on with it, then.

413
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:17,371
Let the headmaster
be nice to me for a change.

414
00:31:19,119 --> 00:31:21,760
And what you did
with the guitar quite beggars belief.

415
00:31:21,799 --> 00:31:23,450
That is not how Kumbaya goes.

416
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:25,881
Neil. So good to see you!

417
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:29,009
I love what you're wearing.
It really does, it's just a great ensemble.

418
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:30,969
So similar to what you were wearing before.

419
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,163
But your laissez-faire attitude
to work is a great counterpoint

420
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,804
to my by-the-book approach.

421
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,319
Great having you on the staff, Neil.

422
00:31:37,359 --> 00:31:39,327
- Thank you.
- Right.

423
00:31:39,359 --> 00:31:40,406
Yeah!

424
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:44,009
He must love you an awful lot
to fly across the Atlantic.

425
00:31:44,079 --> 00:31:46,320
No, he just can't bear losing anything.

426
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:49,849
As far as Grant's concerned,
I'm just a piece of lost property

427
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,003
he wants to retrieve
and put back on his mantelpiece.

428
00:31:53,079 --> 00:31:55,320
He was really scary. Crazy.

429
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:59,160
I had a boyfriend like that once.

430
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,960
The sort who wouldn't
take no for an answer.

431
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,525
Did you? What happened?

432
00:32:02,599 --> 00:32:04,170
I married him.

433
00:32:05,359 --> 00:32:09,000
Mr Eriksson, you know the romance
languages, French, Italian...

434
00:32:09,079 --> 00:32:10,844
Yes, Miss Pringle, I teach them.

435
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:12,961
Well, I was wondering
how they got their name?

436
00:32:13,079 --> 00:32:16,527
- It's to do with Rome, ancient Rome.
- It's from the Latin.

437
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:20,851
So it's just a coincidence
that they sound so romantic?

438
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:23,570
Actually, I'm thinking
of switching to economics.

439
00:32:23,839 --> 00:32:25,250
Oh.

440
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:27,045
He is...

441
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:34,281
Let Miss Pringle worship Ray.

442
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:38,804
Ray.

443
00:32:53,119 --> 00:32:55,087
I can do abso-fucking-lutely anything.

444
00:33:06,759 --> 00:33:07,965
Yeah.

445
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:12,083
Me be President of the United States.

446
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:18,445
Hmm.

447
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:20,080
That's funny.

448
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:22,005
Me be President of the United States.

449
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,604
- Thank God we found you, sir.
- Sorry?

450
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:26,200
We've been looking for you everywhere.

451
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:27,445
Oh, my God!

452
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:29,642
Help! Help! Guns! They're shooting!

453
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,846
Move, move, move! Move!

454
00:33:37,799 --> 00:33:40,405
I am sorry about that, Mr President.

455
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:44,604
Now, here are the briefing papers
for Syria, the deficit,

456
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:47,529
Israel and the Middle East,
China, global warming,

457
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:50,848
unemployment and the
Arctic Wildlife Reserve.

458
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:53,284
They're shooting!

459
00:33:53,359 --> 00:33:55,806
Me be my old self at home!

460
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:05,882
I can do anything.

461
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:10,963
OK, but what do I really want?

462
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:19,289
Give me a really big dick.

463
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:20,965
Ouch!

464
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:23,807
Ouch, not that big, obviously!

465
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:26,402
Just... Dick, return to the old size.

466
00:34:28,519 --> 00:34:30,170
Oh!

467
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:37,365
OK, um... Let me have a penis
that women find exciting.

468
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:42,248
Yeah, it's good, yeah.
Can I have it in white?

469
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:44,724
Right, OK, um...

470
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:47,684
Let me have a really great body.

471
00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:50,365
Wow.

472
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:53,206
No.

473
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:56,728
Um, no, look, no, look,
give me the body of a great man.

474
00:34:58,679 --> 00:35:01,206
What the fuck? Not Albert Einstein.

475
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:04,362
Let me have the great body of a man.

476
00:35:12,199 --> 00:35:15,204
Me be able to see
Catherine from downstairs, now.

477
00:35:29,239 --> 00:35:30,480
Shit.

478
00:35:33,039 --> 00:35:34,565
Let me not be able to see her.

479
00:35:35,079 --> 00:35:36,809
No, I don't mean me go blind.

480
00:35:37,719 --> 00:35:39,768
Let me be able to see
but floor be as it was.

481
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:49,005
Uh, Catherine from downstairs,
forget what just happened.

482
00:35:57,159 --> 00:35:58,650
Move out of the way.

483
00:35:58,719 --> 00:36:00,608
Thank you. Quiet, please. Quietly.

484
00:36:12,159 --> 00:36:14,527
'Um. Ray? "Hmm?"

485
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:18,925
You know earlier on we were talking
about being able to do anything?

486
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,967
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah, well, um...

487
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:27,329
This is going to sound kind of stupid
but suddenly I can.

488
00:36:28,679 --> 00:36:30,329
- Can what?
- Do anything.

489
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:31,646
Just make things happen.

490
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:35,367
Things that shouldn't happen,
I just wave my hand and they do.

491
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,166
You feeling OK?

492
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:40,849
Yeah, um, just look.

493
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:46,126
You, tell us who you were.

494
00:36:46,639 --> 00:36:49,563
You'll never believe this
but I was a conjuror!

495
00:36:50,119 --> 00:36:52,487
I went by the name of The Great Alfredo.

496
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:55,289
Real name was Reg Hoskins.

497
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:59,565
I did variety, clubs,
private parties, the lot.

498
00:36:59,639 --> 00:37:01,519
What is this?
3D projection or something, right?

499
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:03,967
Course, it's all gone now.

500
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,364
- I blame the wogs.
- Hey!

501
00:37:05,639 --> 00:37:07,483
All that black minstrel stuff.

502
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,206
Once they started allowing that...

503
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:10,559
That's not me, that's what I'm saying.
It's...

504
00:37:10,639 --> 00:37:13,483
Jews took over the business.
It was never the same again.

505
00:37:13,559 --> 00:37:15,164
Just go and jump out the window.

506
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,528
Right-o. Watch this.

507
00:37:30,159 --> 00:37:31,206
What...

508
00:37:31,679 --> 00:37:34,251
- How did you do that?
- I don't know.

509
00:37:35,159 --> 00:37:37,242
I could swear it was the skeleton talking.

510
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:39,891
- Yeah, it was.
- OK.

511
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:41,565
Let me see you do another one.

512
00:37:42,159 --> 00:37:43,525
Well, what? I can't think of anything.

513
00:37:43,679 --> 00:37:47,525
Oh, come on.
You know, how about some flowers?

514
00:37:48,519 --> 00:37:50,362
Bunch of flowers in my hand.

515
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:54,081
It's pathetic.
How about room be covered in flowers?

516
00:37:55,679 --> 00:37:56,885
Come on, Ray.

517
00:37:58,239 --> 00:38:00,208
Ray. Think of something more imaginative.

518
00:38:02,039 --> 00:38:05,646
Bloody hell, Palmer.
Did you just throw this out the window?

519
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:08,327
Neil. Did you throw this out the window?

520
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:09,646
That's very funny.

521
00:38:09,719 --> 00:38:12,239
What are you doing here?
Go on, get on home. I'll cover for you.

522
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:14,646
Oh, my God.

523
00:38:17,719 --> 00:38:20,086
This is the best sandwich I've ever tasted.

524
00:38:20,719 --> 00:38:21,880
Told you.

525
00:38:22,239 --> 00:38:24,447
You know what? We could own a racehorse.

526
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:28,724
Ray, we could own
every racehorse in the world.

527
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:29,920
No shit.

528
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:41,530
- We win every time?
- They're all ours.

529
00:38:42,599 --> 00:38:44,887
Let's forget about the horses.

530
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:46,922
We could have anything, Neil.

531
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,570
Wealth, fame. Women.

532
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:53,889
We could make any woman
fall in love with us.

533
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:56,525
Neil, any woman we want.

534
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:00,844
Goodnight, Catherine.
See you later.

535
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:06,123
Jump in, babe.

536
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:08,606
Kerb crawling is illegal
in this country, Grant.

537
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:11,605
That doesn't really apply to people
with my security clearance.

538
00:39:11,679 --> 00:39:13,400
Besides, how else are
you going to get home?

539
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:14,929
On the Tube. Go away.

540
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:18,601
The London Underground is worse than
anything we ever did in Guantanamo.

541
00:39:18,639 --> 00:39:21,291
- You don't deserve that.
- No, I don't deserve this, either.

542
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:24,010
- Please, leave me alone.
- OK, OK, I get it.

543
00:39:24,119 --> 00:39:25,639
But you gotta let me down gently, huh?

544
00:39:26,159 --> 00:39:27,320
What does that mean?

545
00:39:28,639 --> 00:39:30,039
Well, there's somebody else, right?

546
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:32,442
No, Grant, that's not what this is about.

547
00:39:32,679 --> 00:39:33,726
It's...

548
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:36,329
You and I are not compatible.

549
00:39:38,199 --> 00:39:41,123
So, we could grab some
coffee, sit and talk.

550
00:39:41,639 --> 00:39:44,000
What would that even achieve?
There's nothing to talk about.

551
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:47,201
Except for the luxury
apartment I rented for us.

552
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:48,880
It's got a view of St Paul's Cathedral.

553
00:39:50,239 --> 00:39:52,811
Oh, my God. Go home, Grant.

554
00:39:53,559 --> 00:39:55,324
- Here's the key.
- I don't want it.

555
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,166
And when I get you up there,

556
00:39:57,239 --> 00:40:00,164
you're going to think you died
and went to heaven.

557
00:40:38,519 --> 00:40:40,284
- Fuck Grant.
- Oh, yeah, fuck Grant.

558
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:41,690
Fuck Grant.

559
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:49,005
Fuck James Cleverill.

560
00:40:54,679 --> 00:40:56,568
Fuck all TV producers.

561
00:40:56,679 --> 00:40:58,920
Especially ones that say
you can sleep with them.

562
00:40:59,159 --> 00:41:00,969
But if I play my cards right.

563
00:41:11,039 --> 00:41:14,248
Why do I always end up
with the control freaks?

564
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:15,844
- Or gays.
- Yeah.

565
00:41:16,559 --> 00:41:18,608
- Who?
- Him upstairs.

566
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:20,849
Oh, honey, he's not gay.

567
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:24,365
He's attractive. He's kind.

568
00:41:25,079 --> 00:41:26,445
Well, then, fuck him.

569
00:41:26,719 --> 00:41:29,563
- No, he's nice.
- No, I don't mean fuck him.

570
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:33,239
I mean fuck him.

571
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:40,288
- You mean fuck him?
- Yeah.

572
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:42,927
- What, right now?
- No, not now.

573
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:45,559
You've got to let me do your make-up first.

574
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:52,690
<i>Malfunction.
Galactic power failure.</i>

575
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:56,090
Bother, we'll have to suspend the test.

576
00:41:56,119 --> 00:41:58,440
- What?
- This is on the blink, Sharon.

577
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:02,286
The earthling won't have galactic power
until I get it working again.

578
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:03,679
Botheration!

579
00:42:04,039 --> 00:42:07,681
I thought our galactic powers
meant we could do anything?

580
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:15,771
Catherine from downstairs,
be madly in love with me.

581
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:18,206
That was quick.

582
00:42:22,719 --> 00:42:24,085
- Hi.
- Hi.

583
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:26,567
- Um, you're not gay, are you?
- No, no.

584
00:42:36,639 --> 00:42:38,483
- Let's go to bed.
- OK.

585
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:44,851
Oh, shit!

586
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:48,331
Ow, my leg!

587
00:42:53,079 --> 00:42:54,320
Got it.

588
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:58,567
<i>Galactic power
now returning to earthling.</i>

589
00:43:30,679 --> 00:43:33,411
Weather, be like it is in Los Angeles.

590
00:43:35,719 --> 00:43:38,768
I didn't mean be like it is in Los Angeles
right this moment.

591
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:41,485
It's the middle of the
night, for crying out loud.

592
00:43:41,519 --> 00:43:43,887
Weather, be like it usually is

593
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:46,206
in Los Angeles during the day.

594
00:43:47,639 --> 00:43:49,369
So pedantic.

595
00:43:53,199 --> 00:43:54,201
All right.

596
00:43:57,559 --> 00:43:59,449
Clothes, get dressed on me.

597
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:05,764
And smarten yourselves up.

598
00:44:06,599 --> 00:44:07,646
Better.

599
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:33,445
Miss Pringle, this really...

600
00:44:34,599 --> 00:44:35,840
has to stop.

601
00:44:36,239 --> 00:44:39,369
- Oh, Lord.
- Oh, Lord.

602
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:46,922
Yeah.

603
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:50,282
Ah. OK.

604
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:53,047
That was a very interesting... Ow! Ow!

605
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:54,769
Could you just stop that, please?

606
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:58,282
You, stop tapping.
Let's just have a break, shall we? Just...

607
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:01,367
Right, what's next?

608
00:45:02,199 --> 00:45:03,440
Ooh.

609
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:06,050
This one's in German. Wow.

610
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:10,489
Let me be able to understand German.

611
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:17,206
What are you talking about, Dennis?

612
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:20,123
Look, just shut up, OK? I can handle this.

613
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:23,240
She's not going to ask me to marry her.

614
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:26,722
Or have my children, OK?

615
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:29,849
Dennis, what are you talking about?

616
00:45:33,239 --> 00:45:35,163
That's a good idea, actually.
What are you talking about?

617
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:36,561
Dennis, be able to talk.

618
00:45:36,639 --> 00:45:37,925
Biscuits.

619
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:41,927
- What?
- Biscuits.

620
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,525
Maybe if I make her fall in love with me
like a little bit, you know,

621
00:45:44,639 --> 00:45:46,050
so she doesn't want to marry me

622
00:45:46,159 --> 00:45:47,400
- but she would have sex on a regular...
- Biscuits.

623
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:49,871
For crying out loud,
they're in the cupboard.

624
00:45:49,898 --> 00:45:50,516
What are?

625
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:53,690
Biscuits. Red biscuits, black biscuits.

626
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:55,762
- Nothing else matters.
- Is that all you think about?

627
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:57,603
Yes, yes! Biscuits.

628
00:45:59,679 --> 00:46:03,286
All right, Dennis,
become a rational, thinking creature.

629
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:06,844
Look, I just can't concentrate on anything
until I've had one of those biscuits.

630
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,960
I know it's crazy but that's how it is.
I guess I'm kind of hooked on them.

631
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,842
So please give me just one biscuit,

632
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:14,530
then I'll be able to think
about something else.

633
00:46:15,239 --> 00:46:16,365
That makes sense.

634
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:18,840
Oh, oh, oh! He's getting the biscuits!
He's getting them! This is it!

635
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:19,967
Yeah!

636
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:24,202
He's got them.

637
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:27,568
He's got them. He's going to throw one.
Get ready, get ready. Here it comes.

638
00:46:27,719 --> 00:46:29,768
Ah! Mmm. Mmm.

639
00:46:31,599 --> 00:46:36,083
God, it must be terrible being a dog.
I never realised you had so many cravings.

640
00:46:36,199 --> 00:46:38,726
- It's no worse than you and that bitch.
- What bitch?

641
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:40,922
The bitch you were shagging last night.

642
00:46:41,039 --> 00:46:45,329
Oh, my God. She's not a bitch, OK?
She's a lovely human female.

643
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:46,561
And we weren't just shagging.

644
00:46:46,639 --> 00:46:49,246
Right. Come to think of it, I wouldn't
mind shagging your leg right now.

645
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:51,481
A little leg dance, huh?
Just above the sock.

646
00:46:51,559 --> 00:46:53,289
- Ah...
- How about it? Come on, Daddy.

647
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:56,244
I thought I turned you into
a rational, thinking creature.

648
00:46:56,599 --> 00:46:58,806
Rational, thinking creatures
still have desires.

649
00:46:59,159 --> 00:47:00,923
Oh, well,
we can soon deal with that.

650
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:02,239
No!

651
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:04,922
No, no, don't take my
desires away from me.

652
00:47:04,947 --> 00:47:05,668
Why not?

653
00:47:05,719 --> 00:47:09,166
They're what makes my life worth living.
Biscuits, shagging.

654
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:11,567
I don't think I like your conversation.

655
00:47:11,679 --> 00:47:14,489
But I worship you, master.
I love you so much.

656
00:47:14,599 --> 00:47:16,170
- I can't bear displeasing you.
- I... I know.

657
00:47:16,239 --> 00:47:17,809
- My whole world collapses...
- I know. Yes. I love you.

658
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:18,920
When you're cross with me.

659
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:20,166
Look, maybe it was better
when you didn't talk.

660
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:23,483
Oh, no, don't take away my power of speech
now that I can think rationally.

661
00:47:23,599 --> 00:47:24,965
That would be so cruel.

662
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:27,804
- I heard the bell. Somebody at the door.
- OK, no...

663
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:29,762
- The bell! Hey! The bell!
- No, no. Dennis. Dennis, good dog.

664
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:30,920
- Hello, the bell!
- Dennis... Dennis.

665
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:32,085
- Hey, hey, somebody.
- Just... Just quiet.

666
00:47:32,199 --> 00:47:34,362
There it goes again.
Hey, hey, somebody at the door.

667
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:36,168
Oh, no, have I done something wrong again?

668
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:38,248
No, just... Just be quiet.
Do you understand me?

669
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:42,164
Yes. Yes, anything to stop you
being angry with me.

670
00:47:42,239 --> 00:47:43,809
The bell! There it goes again!

671
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:45,085
He)', hey, hey, hey!

672
00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:47,248
Dennis, listen. Just listen,
listen, listen, listen.

673
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:49,168
Be quiet. That is an order.

674
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:51,442
Right. Quiet.

675
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:54,289
I like obeying orders,
especially your orders.

676
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:57,164
Good. Well, then, shut the fuck up.

677
00:47:57,280 --> 00:47:59,760
Right, right. Shut the fuck up.
Yeah, right.

678
00:48:03,119 --> 00:48:04,280
Good boy.

679
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:12,777
Oh, God, I made her do it.
I made her do it...

680
00:48:12,802 --> 00:48:14,833
I... OK.

681
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,128
- Hi.
- Hey.

682
00:48:18,159 --> 00:48:21,003
- Can I come in?
- Yes, yes, yes, yes, of course.

683
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:27,126
- So, look, um, about last night...
- Yes.

684
00:48:27,199 --> 00:48:29,440
- Is this a bad time?
- No, no. No, no.

685
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:31,447
OK. Um, I just... I don't want you to think

686
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:34,802
that I, um, do that sort
of thing all the time

687
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:37,411
because... Because I don't.

688
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:40,324
- Um... I was slightly drunk.
- Yeah, well, I mean, naturally.

689
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:42,322
Otherwise we probably wouldn't have
done the thing with the...

690
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:44,010
- No, no, no, that's not what I mean.
- ...beard trimmer.

691
00:48:44,039 --> 00:48:48,045
I mean, I like you. I, um, I've
always really enjoyed talking to you.

692
00:48:48,159 --> 00:48:51,561
I just... I probably wouldn't have jumped
on you like that if I hadn't...

693
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:56,041
- Been pissed as a newt?
- Well, sort of.

694
00:48:56,199 --> 00:48:58,965
Yeah, OK. Well, then, let's just forget it.
It never... It never happened.

695
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:00,809
No, no, no, that's not
what I'm saying, Neil.

696
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:03,521
Oh, well, um, what did you want, then?

697
00:49:04,199 --> 00:49:05,690
Shag her, Neil!

698
00:49:06,039 --> 00:49:07,643
That's Dennis.

699
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:12,210
- Dennis?
- Yeah. He is a plumber.

700
00:49:12,239 --> 00:49:15,050
Um, I'm having a few problems
with my waterworks. My water pipes.

701
00:49:15,159 --> 00:49:16,365
Shag her, Neil!

702
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:20,679
I'd better get him the shagger.
It's a special wrench that plumbers use.

703
00:49:24,039 --> 00:49:25,371
I thought
I told you to shut up.

704
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:27,601
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm
really sorry, sorry.

705
00:49:27,719 --> 00:49:29,369
You're supposed to be
a rational, thinking creature.

706
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:32,284
Sorry, sorry. Can't help myself. Sorry.
Oh, dear. I wanna shag your leg.

707
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:34,447
Shh. It's not a
great time, to be honest.

708
00:49:34,559 --> 00:49:36,050
Maybe later, if you behave.

709
00:49:36,079 --> 00:49:37,206
Oh...

710
00:49:37,239 --> 00:49:39,594
Oh... Couldn't... Couldn't
find the shagger,

711
00:49:39,621 --> 00:49:41,688
so he just went with
the old decoupler.

712
00:49:41,719 --> 00:49:43,369
I love you, Neil!

713
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:45,527
Shut up, Dennis!

714
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:48,047
It's odd, isn't it,
shouting at the plumber like that?

715
00:49:48,079 --> 00:49:51,527
But, uh, the fact is he's my brother.
The plumber is my brother.

716
00:49:51,559 --> 00:49:53,960
Say you love me, Neil.

717
00:49:54,079 --> 00:49:55,240
And we're very close.

718
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:57,407
- God, Rosie was right.
- Rosie?

719
00:49:57,519 --> 00:49:59,965
Please can I shag your leg?

720
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:03,204
Jesus, Neil, how could you?
The next morning!

721
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:04,726
What? I...

722
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:08,440
- Why do I always end up with creeps?
- I'm not a creep!

723
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:11,483
There was a cat, Neil!
Neil! Hey, you, cat!

724
00:50:11,599 --> 00:50:14,409
Stay out of my garden, go on!
Neil, it's a ginger tom!

725
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:18,286
Dennis, be a dumb animal again
for five minutes.

726
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:23,407
So she thinks I'm gay.

727
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:25,885
I mean, so what, you know?

728
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:29,128
I mean, it means that she won't want to
marry me or have my kids.

729
00:50:30,119 --> 00:50:32,282
Bingo. Problem solved.

730
00:50:33,119 --> 00:50:34,644
Thank you, Dennis.

731
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:42,126
Catherine!

732
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:47,603
Catherine!

733
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:52,166
Um, me be on the bus.

734
00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:57,923
Ah! I don't mean on the bus.
I mean in the bus.

735
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:03,648
Not in the engine.
In the passenger accommodation!

736
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:07,329
Ow!

737
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:11,641
Hey!

738
00:51:12,599 --> 00:51:13,646
Catherine!

739
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:25,483
Catherine!

740
00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:27,329
Catherine!

741
00:51:27,719 --> 00:51:28,846
Whoa.

742
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:30,961
- Ray.
- You've gotta stop Miss Pringle.

743
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,731
She's... She's set up shrines
all over the school.

744
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:35,170
There's even a website.

745
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:36,809
Look, you wanted her to worship you, OK?

746
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:38,842
- Not like this.
- Ray, I don't have time for this.

747
00:51:39,039 --> 00:51:40,849
Wait, wait, wait.
You haven't lost the powers, have you?

748
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:43,201
- No, I haven't lost the powers. Ray.
- You have. You've lost the...

749
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:44,367
- I haven't lost the powers.
- Do the thing.

750
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:45,889
Ray, become a duck.

751
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:52,264
Ray. Ray, stop it. Ray, stop it.
Ray, stop it.

752
00:51:52,289 --> 00:51:53,945
Ray, become a sausage.

753
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:56,951
I haven't lost the powers, Ray, OK?
This is...

754
00:51:56,976 --> 00:51:58,224
Where is he, Neil?

755
00:51:58,679 --> 00:52:01,047
Oh. That's his car.

756
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:04,842
Oh. Behold the car of Ray!

757
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:11,170
- Catherine, can we talk?
- No.

758
00:52:11,199 --> 00:52:12,610
But I love you.

759
00:52:12,719 --> 00:52:14,528
You also love Dennis, apparently.

760
00:52:14,559 --> 00:52:16,927
- Did you take that off there?
- Uh, no, this is mine.

761
00:52:17,039 --> 00:52:18,405
- You rs?
- Yeah.

762
00:52:18,519 --> 00:52:20,170
Look, you've got it all wrong about Dennis.

763
00:52:20,239 --> 00:52:23,880
I've nothing whatsoever against Dennis.
You love him, he loves you.

764
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:26,121
I'm happy for both of you.
Just don't bring me into it.

765
00:52:26,239 --> 00:52:28,402
Yeah, no, but there's something I need
to tell you about Dennis.

766
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:30,521
You are going to have to pay for that
now that you've touched it.

767
00:52:30,559 --> 00:52:32,164
- It's mine!
- No, it isn't.

768
00:52:32,239 --> 00:52:33,684
Look, I heard what you
said to each other, Neil.

769
00:52:33,719 --> 00:52:36,007
Yeah, look. There's something crucial
about Dennis you don't know.

770
00:52:36,079 --> 00:52:37,081
- Hey!
- He's not a man.

771
00:52:37,199 --> 00:52:38,360
I don't want to hear this, Neil.

772
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:39,891
I know, but I'm just
saying, he's not a man.

773
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:41,762
OW! Ah! Hell's tits!

774
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:43,244
- You pervert!
- Ow!

775
00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:44,800
You come in here and steal our stuff?

776
00:52:44,840 --> 00:52:45,887
I told you, that's not your sausage.

777
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:48,161
- It is my sausage. Give it back.
- Get off. Be careful, be careful.

778
00:52:48,239 --> 00:52:49,764
- Just let go!
- Oh, God!

779
00:52:49,840 --> 00:52:52,411
- Give me 80p.
- Fine.

780
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,047
- I'll just get your change.
- No, it's... Never mind. It's...

781
00:52:56,079 --> 00:52:57,411
Well, no, cos it's £4.20.

782
00:52:57,440 --> 00:52:59,442
- Keep it.
- It's too much for a tip.

783
00:52:59,559 --> 00:53:02,449
- Have it your way.
- I should think so, too. Jesus.

784
00:53:04,599 --> 00:53:07,284
Feck. Sausage, become Ray.

785
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:12,402
Jesus, Neil. Have you any idea
how vulnerable a sausage feels?

786
00:53:12,679 --> 00:53:13,885
There he is!

787
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:16,929
I'm off!

788
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:19,760
- Leave me alone, you nutters!
- Ray! Ray!

789
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:22,400
Here you go. You must have been hungry.

790
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:28,807
It's clear he has no idea of doing
any good whatsoever.

791
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:32,965
Why can't we just get on
with the destruction?

792
00:53:33,039 --> 00:53:35,121
Because there are rules, Maureen.

793
00:53:35,199 --> 00:53:37,043
We must follow galactic procedure.

794
00:53:37,119 --> 00:53:41,807
Rules didn't stop you from eating
the inhabitants of 64378, Janet!

795
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:44,440
They were delicious.
Very crunchy, as I recall...

796
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:51,648
- Surprise, surprise!
- Oh, my God!

797
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:53,807
- No!
- Wait. Wait, wait. Catherine!

798
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:56,400
You're crazy, do you know that?

799
00:53:56,599 --> 00:53:59,079
Crazy in love, darlin'.

800
00:53:59,239 --> 00:54:01,128
Get out of my flat, Grant.

801
00:54:01,159 --> 00:54:02,650
Well, I can't because
you've locked the door now, babe.

802
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:04,608
Well, then, get out the way you got in.

803
00:54:04,639 --> 00:54:07,849
Oh, honey, come on, now. That ain't nice!

804
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:11,168
Just get out, Grant.
I never want to see you again!

805
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:12,963
Get out of my life!

806
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,650
Get out!

807
00:54:15,119 --> 00:54:17,248
Come on, now, open the door.

808
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:20,001
Sorry. Sorry about the noise.

809
00:54:20,679 --> 00:54:22,364
At least it wasn't barking.

810
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:24,329
Feck off. Not you.

811
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:25,920
- Walk out the front door, OK?
- Honey!

812
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:27,882
Then sneak in the back.
Make your way up to my place. No moves.

813
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:30,440
- No, no, no funny business.
- Come on. Let the love shine through.

814
00:54:30,519 --> 00:54:31,851
You can just stay out of his way

815
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:33,842
- and I will make you dinner.
- Love me!

816
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:36,208
- I hate doors!
- All right.

817
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:37,809
But invite Dennis. We'll
behave like grown-ups.

818
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:39,523
- Catherine?
- OK.

819
00:54:39,639 --> 00:54:41,440
- Catherine, come back.
- I'm leaving!

820
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:45,643
OK. I'm coming!
Hold on. Wait for me, now.

821
00:54:48,280 --> 00:54:49,849
She's coming to dinner!

822
00:54:49,880 --> 00:54:52,280
<i>This episode looks at doggy fantasies.</i>

823
00:54:52,360 --> 00:54:54,726
Whoa. Hey! It was just about to start.

824
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:56,882
She's coming to dinner.

825
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:59,327
- Who?
- Catherine.

826
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:01,043
Oh, the bitch.

827
00:55:01,159 --> 00:55:04,880
Don't call her that, all right?
I don't want you chipping in, either, OK?

828
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:06,842
Just pretend to be a dumb animal again.

829
00:55:07,239 --> 00:55:08,570
Me? A dumb animal?

830
00:55:08,719 --> 00:55:10,643
<i>(New Yeah, we“, you know how to pretend,
mm you'?</i>

831
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:12,210
It's just... It's called acting.

832
00:55:12,239 --> 00:55:14,239
Oh, you mean like when I'm having
my tummy tickled?

833
00:55:14,639 --> 00:55:17,722
- You love having your tummy tickled.
- No, I don't.

834
00:55:18,519 --> 00:55:21,090
- What?
- It's a sham, Neil. All dogs do it.

835
00:55:21,639 --> 00:55:25,041
- Why?
- Why do humans like tickling dogs' tummies?

836
00:55:25,239 --> 00:55:27,003
Because they love
having their tummies tickled.

837
00:55:27,079 --> 00:55:31,369
Uh-uh. Dogs pretend to like it because
they know human beings like doing it.

838
00:55:32,239 --> 00:55:37,086
Well, just pretend to be
a perfectly ordinary dog, OK?

839
00:55:37,239 --> 00:55:39,561
Can't I join in the
conversation just a little bit?

840
00:55:39,599 --> 00:55:42,922
- No.
- That is so cruel.

841
00:55:44,599 --> 00:55:46,483
Somebody at the door! Hey!
Hey! It's the bell!

842
00:55:46,509 --> 00:55:48,311
It's the bell! It's the bell!
It's the bell!

843
00:55:48,360 --> 00:55:50,760
- I know it's the bell, Dennis.
- Right. No, no, sorry.

844
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:54,407
Just one more peep out of you, OK,
and the flea collar is going back on again.

845
00:55:55,079 --> 00:55:58,050
Right, right, right. Sorry,
sorry, sorry, sorry.

846
00:55:58,119 --> 00:55:59,360
Bark.

847
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:01,606
Woof.

848
00:56:02,119 --> 00:56:03,451
Do it properly-

849
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:06,969
Yeah, good. OK, thank you.

850
00:56:07,079 --> 00:56:08,525
Got it.

851
00:56:10,039 --> 00:56:11,121
- Hi.
- Has he gone?

852
00:56:11,199 --> 00:56:12,565
No, I don't think so.

853
00:56:13,039 --> 00:56:14,882
- Ooh!
- Dennis, down.

854
00:56:15,800 --> 00:56:18,280
You named him after the plumber,
then, did you?

855
00:56:18,360 --> 00:56:19,771
Uh...

856
00:56:21,239 --> 00:56:24,244
Ah. Do you want your tummy tickled?

857
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:27,246
Why do dogs like that so much?

858
00:56:28,559 --> 00:56:30,050
I don't know.

859
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:37,644
So the producer promises to take me
out of the general office

860
00:56:37,719 --> 00:56:40,166
and give me a big desk with a view,
but he won't.

861
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:43,643
He's just trying to get me into bed.

862
00:56:46,239 --> 00:56:47,844
What did you want to tell me?

863
00:56:48,559 --> 00:56:50,324
Uh, just try this first.

864
00:57:02,519 --> 00:57:03,601
Mmm.

865
00:57:06,159 --> 00:57:07,525
Oh, that's incredible.

866
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:13,282
That's the most wonderful thing
I've ever tasted in my life.

867
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:21,166
Mmm. I had no idea you were
such a fantastic cook.

868
00:57:21,199 --> 00:57:24,840
I've... I've... It's unlike anything
I've ever tasted. What is it?

869
00:57:25,559 --> 00:57:29,360
I just said, "Let the soup be the most
amazing thing Catherine has ever tasted",

870
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:31,369
"unlike anything she's tasted before."

871
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:34,847
- And it is.
- Really?

872
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:41,842
Really. I can make things happen. Anything.

873
00:57:43,079 --> 00:57:45,003
That's what I was trying to tell you
this morning, you know?

874
00:57:45,039 --> 00:57:47,327
I wasn't talking to a live-in
homosexual plumber.

875
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:49,050
I was talking to Dennis.

876
00:57:49,880 --> 00:57:51,847
- The dog?
- Dennis the dog.

877
00:57:52,719 --> 00:57:57,407
- Who answered you back?
- Yeah, because I made him talk.

878
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:01,567
- Oh.
- With my powers.

879
00:58:03,079 --> 00:58:04,605
Special powers?

880
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:08,360
I mean, what, you... You want
a bigger desk? You got it.

881
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:10,248
You want a great view? You got it.

882
00:58:11,239 --> 00:58:15,927
Um... Neil, how long have you had
these special powers?

883
00:58:16,559 --> 00:58:18,369
Well, they came upon me very suddenly.

884
00:58:18,440 --> 00:58:21,762
- Very suddenly?
- Yeah, I was knocked off my bike.

885
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:23,764
Just ask me to do something, anything.

886
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:27,088
- Just, you know...
- Listen, Neil, it's... It's OK.

887
00:58:27,800 --> 00:58:29,210
You can get help with this.

888
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:30,769
Son of a bitch!

889
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:32,121
Oh!

890
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:33,811
Shit, Grant!

891
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:35,081
I'm out of here!

892
00:58:35,239 --> 00:58:37,606
- There's nobody else, huh?
- Who is this guy?

893
00:58:37,639 --> 00:58:39,927
She didn't tell you? I'm her fiancé.

894
00:58:39,960 --> 00:58:41,643
- You're not my fiancé, Grant.
- Oh, yeah?

895
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:44,081
And you weren't just making out
with this apology of a man?

896
00:58:44,119 --> 00:58:45,405
Stop this.

897
00:58:45,559 --> 00:58:47,402
You know how long you'd last
on a battlefield, soldier?

898
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:48,601
I'm sorry, Neil.

899
00:58:48,639 --> 00:58:50,722
- That long.
- I'm warning you.

900
00:58:51,119 --> 00:58:53,599
- You're warning me?
- Yeah, I'm warning you.

901
00:58:53,639 --> 00:58:55,244
Who is this guy?

902
00:58:55,320 --> 00:58:57,242
- Why don't you suck on this, asshole?
- Grant!

903
00:58:57,559 --> 00:59:00,449
All I have to do is go like this and...
And say what?

904
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:03,802
- Where did you find this fruitcake?
- Put that away, Grant.

905
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:06,081
Uh, what can I say? Grant, become a fairy?

906
00:59:06,159 --> 00:59:08,639
- It's Grant, not...
- ...Grant.

907
00:59:08,760 --> 00:59:10,728
- Stop it.
- And you're the goddamn fairy.

908
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:12,768
How about Grant go back
to where you came from?

909
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:15,201
- It's Grant.
- How about kiss my arse, Grant?

910
00:59:15,320 --> 00:59:16,969
Neil, don't. He's crazy.

911
00:59:17,039 --> 00:59:20,646
How about you say, "Please, Grant,
don't put a bullet through my brain?"

912
00:59:20,719 --> 00:59:21,646
Grant, stop it!

913
00:59:21,672 --> 00:59:24,635
I prefer, "Let all
bullets bounce off me."

914
00:59:24,800 --> 00:59:28,440
- Go on, shoot me.
- Oh, my God. You're both crazy.

915
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:30,561
- He doesn't dare.
- Neil, please, please.

916
00:59:30,639 --> 00:59:33,246
Go on, pull the trigger.
What's the matter, "Grant"?

917
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:34,650
- Shut up.
- Go on, shoot me.

918
00:59:34,840 --> 00:59:36,284
- Neil, he will.
- No, he won't.

919
00:59:36,320 --> 00:59:39,289
- Yes, I will.
- No, you won't. Grant, drop the gun.

920
00:59:39,320 --> 00:59:41,322
You little shit!

921
00:59:43,159 --> 00:59:44,969
You're idiots, both of you.

922
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:46,081
I wouldn't do this if I were you.

923
00:59:46,159 --> 00:59:47,161
"I wouldn't do
this if I were you."

924
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:48,405
God, I hate the English.

925
00:59:53,519 --> 00:59:56,000
Let Grant's arm break if
he tries to throttle me.

926
00:59:56,119 --> 00:59:57,769
Shut up. It's Grant!

927
00:59:57,840 --> 00:59:59,682
Oh.

928
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,603
Help! Help! Help!

929
01:00:01,679 --> 01:00:02,840
Who the heck was that?

930
01:00:02,920 --> 01:00:05,001
Uh, that's Dennis.

931
01:00:05,159 --> 01:00:06,206
Ow.

932
01:00:09,519 --> 01:00:14,686
It's just a dog! English dick.

933
01:00:15,519 --> 01:00:19,126
- Ow! Ow... Shit! Shit! What happened?
- Yeah, yeah.

934
01:00:19,199 --> 01:00:21,726
- Do you want me to make it better?
- It hurts.

935
01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:23,483
Grant's arm be better.

936
01:00:26,639 --> 01:00:29,210
Hey. Hey, hey, hey. Hey, what is this?

937
01:00:30,039 --> 01:00:32,007
Grant be stuck on the ceiling.

938
01:00:32,199 --> 01:00:33,565
Oh, shit!

939
01:00:33,679 --> 01:00:34,920
Grant be plastered to the wall.

940
01:00:35,960 --> 01:00:38,166
Wait, wait, wait. Let's talk about this.

941
01:00:38,199 --> 01:00:40,521
Grant be buried head
first in the plant pot.

942
01:00:40,559 --> 01:00:42,050
What do you mean, potted plant?

943
01:00:44,719 --> 01:00:46,882
Grant be standing in front of me.

944
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:54,403
Yeah. You wanna be nice to me, Grant, OK?

945
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:55,686
Maybe I can help you.

946
01:00:55,920 --> 01:01:00,402
- You?
- I could make your life absolutely hell

947
01:01:00,519 --> 01:01:03,251
or I could say,
"Grant be holding a million dollars."

948
01:01:06,920 --> 01:01:10,048
on, yeah!

949
01:01:10,159 --> 01:01:12,686
Or I could say, "A million
dollars, disappear."

950
01:01:13,519 --> 01:01:14,601
Fuck! Come on!

951
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:19,447
I can do anything.
All I have to do is wave my hand.

952
01:01:20,440 --> 01:01:22,681
- You gotta wave your hand?
- That's right.

953
01:01:23,239 --> 01:01:25,925
Isn't he great? I love you.
I love you so much.

954
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,367
- Dennis, keep out of this.
- But you are great, Neil.

955
01:01:28,519 --> 01:01:30,726
- You can do anything.
- Dennis, shut up. I'm not...

956
01:01:30,760 --> 01:01:32,887
Master! Neil!

957
01:01:40,679 --> 01:01:44,365
- Hi. Made your mind up yet?
- How about tonight?

958
01:01:44,800 --> 01:01:46,449
Good girl. 8:00, my place.

959
01:01:46,559 --> 01:01:48,960
Yeah. I always pick the wrong guy, anyway.

960
01:01:49,079 --> 01:01:52,447
Oh, and, uh, I got you a new desk.

961
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:29,561
Hey!

962
01:02:29,679 --> 01:02:35,130
Well, it's about time. Now, listen up.
When I take that gag out of your mouth,

963
01:02:35,159 --> 01:02:38,322
you're going to say exactly what's on that
piece of paper, you understand?

964
01:02:38,480 --> 01:02:44,123
The moment you say a word that is not on
that piece of paper, I kill the dog.

965
01:02:45,159 --> 01:02:46,679
Don't let him shoot me, Neil.

966
01:02:46,760 --> 01:02:48,523
Understand? Nod if you understand.

967
01:02:50,920 --> 01:02:57,485
OK. OK. I'm going to take the gag out now.
Remember, one wrong word

968
01:02:58,960 --> 01:03:00,688
and the dog gets it.

969
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:09,364
OK, read. Item number one, let's go.
Come on.

970
01:03:09,519 --> 01:03:12,126
"Item number one.
All pasty white Englishmen..."

971
01:03:12,199 --> 01:03:15,043
"Pasty white Englishmen to get big ears
and webbed feet?"

972
01:03:18,719 --> 01:03:21,041
- Now wave your hand.
- What?

973
01:03:21,119 --> 01:03:22,724
Wave your hand!

974
01:03:22,880 --> 01:03:24,643
On!

975
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:29,686
Yes! Yes! Oh, it's beautiful.

976
01:03:39,159 --> 01:03:42,164
Neil! Neil!

977
01:03:50,239 --> 01:03:51,570
Neil?

978
01:04:01,360 --> 01:04:02,885
Neil?

979
01:04:09,920 --> 01:04:11,081
Oh!

980
01:04:12,280 --> 01:04:13,440
You don't worship me, do you?

981
01:04:13,559 --> 01:04:17,246
What? Ray. You're Ray.

982
01:04:19,199 --> 01:04:20,769
- I can't find Neil.
- Isn't he here?

983
01:04:21,239 --> 01:04:22,365
He wasn't at school, either.

984
01:04:22,440 --> 01:04:25,090
Oh, I left him with my crazy,
gun-toting ex-boyfriend.

985
01:04:26,280 --> 01:04:28,362
- Neil's got these powers.
- No, I know, I know.

986
01:04:28,440 --> 01:04:29,521
Oh.

987
01:04:29,599 --> 01:04:33,445
He got Miss Pringle to... To worship me
and now she's turned me into a religion.

988
01:04:33,880 --> 01:04:35,961
- They think I'm immortal.
- So what?

989
01:04:36,719 --> 01:04:39,724
They want me to prove it
by rising from the dead.

990
01:04:41,360 --> 01:04:42,771
We've got to find Neil.

991
01:04:43,960 --> 01:04:45,610
Wait.

992
01:04:47,400 --> 01:04:49,641
Hey! Hey!

993
01:04:50,119 --> 01:04:51,644
What are you doing?

994
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:55,925
No...

995
01:04:57,039 --> 01:04:58,121
Got it.

996
01:04:58,800 --> 01:05:00,324
- Where's your car?
- Why?

997
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:01,606
I know where they are.

998
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:07,005
It's just out here. We can... Shit!

999
01:05:07,639 --> 01:05:08,846
Lord.

1000
01:05:08,920 --> 01:05:10,445
Oh, no. Run for it!

1001
01:05:11,840 --> 01:05:14,684
Get him! Lord!

1002
01:05:16,559 --> 01:05:17,800
Yeah!

1003
01:05:17,960 --> 01:05:21,088
This is working beautifully.
OK, keep going. Number three. Let's go.

1004
01:05:21,519 --> 01:05:27,527
OK. "Three. All British police
to have pink uniforms."

1005
01:05:27,639 --> 01:05:29,608
My personal favourite.

1006
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:33,764
Ray!

1007
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,480
Lord! Come to us!

1008
01:05:37,760 --> 01:05:40,525
Ray! Ray!

1009
01:05:45,480 --> 01:05:47,005
What's this all about?

1010
01:05:47,800 --> 01:05:51,043
Oi!

1011
01:05:51,639 --> 01:05:52,880
Take that off!

1012
01:06:01,679 --> 01:06:02,726
There he is!

1013
01:06:33,639 --> 01:06:38,567
Oh! Oh... Oh, it's beautiful.

1014
01:06:38,679 --> 01:06:40,409
I can't believe it. All right, next one.

1015
01:06:40,440 --> 01:06:42,123
Come on, read.

1016
01:06:42,199 --> 01:06:45,204
"Let all traffic lights be
permanently set on green."

1017
01:06:45,400 --> 01:06:46,764
Come on. That's just...

1018
01:06:46,880 --> 01:06:49,326
Oh, hey, hey, hey, hey-Hey-

1019
01:06:49,440 --> 01:06:51,568
Huh? Do it, do it.

1020
01:06:55,440 --> 01:06:56,929
Wait. Now, listen.

1021
01:07:07,559 --> 01:07:09,050
All right.

1022
01:07:13,639 --> 01:07:15,440
Grant, are you in there?

1023
01:07:15,960 --> 01:07:19,168
Skip to the end. Hurry up.
Just skip to the end!

1024
01:07:20,039 --> 01:07:24,045
Skip to the end. Just...
There. Come on, quick. Read it.

1025
01:07:24,119 --> 01:07:28,010
Uh, uh... OK, OK,
"Item 417, Catherine West..."

1026
01:07:28,320 --> 01:07:29,367
- Come on.
- All right.

1027
01:07:30,320 --> 01:07:32,003
Let them go, Grant.

1028
01:07:32,079 --> 01:07:35,527
Why should I? Go on, Neil.
Read the last item.

1029
01:07:36,280 --> 01:07:41,730
"Item 417, Catherine West be madly, deeply
in love with Colonel Grant Kotchev"

1030
01:07:42,280 --> 01:07:44,726
"and leap on him like a tigress
begging for sex."

1031
01:07:47,119 --> 01:07:50,043
- You bastard.
- Now, come on, now.

1032
01:07:50,119 --> 01:07:51,451
Wave your hand. Come on.

1033
01:07:51,519 --> 01:07:53,648
- Neil, don't!
- Or the dog gets it!

1034
01:07:53,719 --> 01:07:55,005
Don't let him shoot me, Neil.

1035
01:07:55,079 --> 01:07:56,445
Come on, wave your goddamn hand!

1036
01:07:56,559 --> 01:07:59,210
But I don't want to love him, Neil.
I don't want to go anywhere near him.

1037
01:07:59,280 --> 01:08:00,849
I don't wanna die.

1038
01:08:02,679 --> 01:08:04,250
Yeah.

1039
01:08:04,800 --> 01:08:09,726
Grant, I love you.
Please, please, let's have sex now.

1040
01:08:09,800 --> 01:08:11,164
Oh, yeah.

1041
01:08:14,280 --> 01:08:15,405
Dennis, be free.

1042
01:08:15,480 --> 01:08:17,083
I'm free! I'm free!

1043
01:08:17,159 --> 01:08:18,286
Please.

1044
01:08:18,359 --> 01:08:20,248
Uh, uh,

1045
01:08:20,319 --> 01:08:21,605
- Grant become a corgi!
- What?

1046
01:08:21,680 --> 01:08:22,966
Oh, shit.

1047
01:08:23,079 --> 01:08:24,240
Do it. Do it, Grant.

1048
01:08:25,319 --> 01:08:27,003
Do it, do it!

1049
01:08:27,560 --> 01:08:28,890
Me be free.

1050
01:08:29,680 --> 01:08:32,159
Yes, yes! Master.

1051
01:08:32,239 --> 01:08:34,162
- Yeah.
- You chose to save me rather than that bitch.

1052
01:08:34,239 --> 01:08:37,686
Yeah, don't call her that. Catherine be
her normal self and not in love with Grant.

1053
01:08:39,119 --> 01:08:40,167
Ugh!

1054
01:08:41,640 --> 01:08:43,768
And all Grant's wishes be cancelled.

1055
01:08:48,840 --> 01:08:49,886
- Ray!
- Oh, shit.

1056
01:08:49,960 --> 01:08:51,689
Oh, no. Get off me!

1057
01:08:51,760 --> 01:08:52,806
Neil, stop them!

1058
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:55,405
Lord, show us how to conquer death!

1059
01:08:55,479 --> 01:08:58,006
Dorothy Pringle, think about Ray
the way that you used to.

1060
01:09:01,279 --> 01:09:04,648
- What the hell, Ray?
- It was nothing to do with me.

1061
01:09:05,199 --> 01:09:07,407
Get lost, you creep!

1062
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:10,244
- Thank you.
- Everyone else, forget about Ray.

1063
01:09:12,840 --> 01:09:15,490
Thanks, Neil. Thanks a whole bunch.

1064
01:09:18,760 --> 01:09:20,329
Ray, could you take me home, please?

1065
01:09:20,399 --> 01:09:21,845
Sure.

1066
01:09:23,640 --> 01:09:25,881
I'm... I'm sorry...

1067
01:09:29,720 --> 01:09:31,529
Any thoughts?

1068
01:09:32,119 --> 01:09:36,444
- Pathetic!
- He has no concept of good or evil.

1069
01:09:36,920 --> 01:09:39,161
Well, the dogs seem all right.

1070
01:09:39,680 --> 01:09:42,286
Yes, yes,
the dogs are all right.

1071
01:09:42,311 --> 01:09:43,993
It's the people I can't stand.

1072
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,367
Oh, hey. Catherine, hi.

1073
01:10:09,439 --> 01:10:12,488
Hey, sorry about the other night.
It was... Can I cook you supper?

1074
01:10:12,600 --> 01:10:15,001
- Uh, no, thanks, Neil.
- I'm doing a whole suckling pig.

1075
01:10:15,079 --> 01:10:17,047
- No.
- Hey, what's the matter?

1076
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:19,443
Is it because I made you
throw yourself at Grant?

1077
01:10:19,600 --> 01:10:23,764
No. Look, you did what you had to do.
It worked. Forgotten.

1078
01:10:24,079 --> 01:10:25,922
Well, what is it, then?

1079
01:10:26,520 --> 01:10:28,761
Do you know what it feels like
to be in someone else's power?

1080
01:10:28,880 --> 01:10:30,369
To have no will of your own?

1081
01:10:30,760 --> 01:10:34,525
Look, I thought that I made you love me.

1082
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:37,445
- What?
- You know, with my powers.

1083
01:10:39,199 --> 01:10:40,725
Oh, my God.

1084
01:10:42,159 --> 01:10:43,917
Did I really
come home early tonight

1085
01:10:43,944 --> 01:10:45,505
because I wanted to
or did you make me?

1086
01:10:45,800 --> 01:10:48,600
Have I always lived opposite you
or have you somehow rearranged things?

1087
01:10:50,199 --> 01:10:52,167
- I'm never going to know.
- Look, I love you.

1088
01:10:52,239 --> 01:10:55,323
How could any woman love a man
who could make her do whatever he wants,

1089
01:10:55,399 --> 01:10:57,845
any second, every day, forever?

1090
01:10:58,960 --> 01:11:02,407
Look, I'm sorry, Neil, I could never
love you, not in a million years.

1091
01:11:02,479 --> 01:11:04,130
Oh! Catherine...

1092
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:13,484
Sharon, Sharon, terrible news!

1093
01:11:13,880 --> 01:11:15,564
This is indeed grave news.

1094
01:11:15,640 --> 01:11:18,291
It appears that the Salubrious Gat has been

1095
01:11:18,359 --> 01:11:20,966
interfering with our translation devices.

1096
01:11:21,159 --> 01:11:22,570
What's he done, Sharon?

1097
01:11:22,840 --> 01:11:25,411
I'm afraid, Janet, that we have been
calling ourselves

1098
01:11:25,479 --> 01:11:29,006
by foolish-sounding earthling names.

1099
01:11:30,079 --> 01:11:32,000
Female ones, at that.

1100
01:11:32,039 --> 01:11:38,810
It seems that Sharon is particularly favoured
among female earthlings from Australia.

1101
01:11:38,880 --> 01:11:40,166
The shame of it.

1102
01:11:40,359 --> 01:11:44,159
Sharon... I mean,
what should we be calling you?

1103
01:11:44,600 --> 01:11:48,570
Call me the Death-Dealing Darkness-Bringer.

1104
01:11:48,640 --> 01:11:50,926
Yes, oh, Death-Dealer.

1105
01:11:51,159 --> 01:11:54,766
Great waffles, master.

1106
01:11:55,279 --> 01:11:56,770
Who cares about waffles?

1107
01:11:56,840 --> 01:12:01,561
Catherine hates me. Ray hates me.
Everybody hates me.

1108
01:12:01,960 --> 01:12:04,167
I don't hate you and I care about waffles.

1109
01:12:04,479 --> 01:12:06,960
I think I like them even more
than biscuits, even red biscuits.

1110
01:12:07,039 --> 01:12:09,645
You know what the worse thing is, Dennis?
This is all my fault.

1111
01:12:09,760 --> 01:12:10,886
Mmm-hmm?

1112
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:13,690
You know, I was just thinking about myself,
what I could get.

1113
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:16,922
- Hmm.
- And yet with these powers, you know,

1114
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,367
I could have solved every
problem in the world.

1115
01:12:19,479 --> 01:12:22,926
- I could have made people happy.
- You couldn't make Catherine happy.

1116
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:27,050
Yeah, because I wanted her to love me.
You know, I was being selfish.

1117
01:12:27,119 --> 01:12:30,168
I mean, take world hunger, you know? Uh...

1118
01:12:30,399 --> 01:12:32,880
Let everybody in the world have as much
food as they want.

1119
01:12:36,359 --> 01:12:39,886
I mean, take homelessness. Let everybody
in the world have somewhere to live.

1120
01:12:40,079 --> 01:12:42,242
No, no, no, live in their dream house.

1121
01:12:42,520 --> 01:12:46,569
And war, senseless war, over forever.

1122
01:12:46,640 --> 01:12:49,927
Let there be no reason for anyone
to make war on anyone any more.

1123
01:12:50,039 --> 01:12:51,882
Yay!

1124
01:12:52,159 --> 01:12:54,162
Oh, and reverse global warming.

1125
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:56,411
Has it happened?

1126
01:13:01,479 --> 01:13:04,609
The latest nation to
succumb to the sudden mysterious

1127
01:13:04,680 --> 01:13:07,809
<i>exponential growth in world food
supplies is China,</i>

1128
01:13:07,880 --> 01:13:11,042
<i>where the average weight
is now 300 pounds and rising.</i>

1129
01:13:11,119 --> 01:13:14,521
<i>Well, today a party of picnicking
schoolchildren brought down</i>

1130
01:13:14,600 --> 01:13:17,887
<i>a mile-long section of
the Great Wall of China.</i>

1131
01:13:17,960 --> 01:13:20,405
<i>As homelessness
becomes</i> a <i>thing of the past,</i>

1132
01:13:20,479 --> 01:13:23,244
<i>the last undeveloped area
of the Sahara Desert</i>

1133
01:13:23,319 --> 01:13:26,688
<i>has become a gated community
known as Beau Geste Towers.</i>

1134
01:13:26,760 --> 01:13:29,365
<i>Property developers are now
converging on Antarctica.</i>

1135
01:13:29,439 --> 01:13:32,649
- Well, I mean, at least I got rid of war.
- Whoa, that was a good one.

1136
01:13:33,359 --> 01:13:34,805
"Let there be no reason to make war..."

1137
01:13:34,880 --> 01:13:36,689
- "To make war on anyone any more."
- "...on anyone any more."

1138
01:13:36,760 --> 01:13:38,649
How could that go wrong?

1139
01:13:38,720 --> 01:13:42,167
<i>For no reason at all,
New Zealand has declared war on Iceland.</i>

1140
01:13:42,239 --> 01:13:43,479
Oh, wow. Oh, dear.

1141
01:13:43,640 --> 01:13:47,564
<i>Barbados has declared war on Somalia.
And in a surprise move,</i>

1142
01:13:47,640 --> 01:13:52,520
<i>the tiny island of St Kitts and Nevis has
declared war on the entire rest of the world.</i>

1143
01:13:52,600 --> 01:13:55,126
<i>Our war correspondent says
he is unavailable for comment</i>

1144
01:13:55,239 --> 01:13:59,244
<i>because he's too busy covering all the
other wars which have just broken out</i>

1145
01:13:59,319 --> 01:14:01,686
<i>for no reason at all.</i>

1146
01:14:01,760 --> 01:14:06,606
<i>A short time ago, scientists were afraid
of constantly rising global temperatures.</i>

1147
01:14:06,680 --> 01:14:09,001
<i>- But none of them have any explanation...
- Oh, my God.</i>

1148
01:14:09,079 --> 01:14:11,047
<i>- ...for this sudden return...
- Global warming.</i>

1149
01:14:11,119 --> 01:14:17,685
<i>Not only to the last ice age but to a
snowball Earth of half a billion years ago.</i>

1150
01:14:18,359 --> 01:14:23,604
<i>On the other hand, plans to turn the Antarctic
into the Captain Scott gated community</i>

1151
01:14:24,119 --> 01:14:25,609
<i>- have been put on hold...
- Shit!</i>

1152
01:14:25,680 --> 01:14:26,608
Shit, shit, shit!

1153
01:14:26,634 --> 01:14:29,470
Oh, it's not so easy
trying to do good, is it?

1154
01:14:29,560 --> 01:14:31,561
Yeah, but this is just unfair.

1155
01:14:32,479 --> 01:14:34,881
Let everything go back to how it was
before I started trying to make

1156
01:14:34,960 --> 01:14:36,564
everything better for everybody.

1157
01:14:37,479 --> 01:14:40,164
<i>Beautiful though
the Earth looks from space,</i>

1158
01:14:40,239 --> 01:14:45,006
<i>we all know how fragile it is, how much
damage human beings have done to it</i>

1159
01:14:45,079 --> 01:14:48,640
<i>and will, it seems, continue to do to it.</i>

1160
01:14:50,600 --> 01:14:54,082
Absolute power doesn't corrupt.
It just drives you bloody mad.

1161
01:15:05,159 --> 01:15:08,323
- Tell Catherine I love her.
- Don't do it, master. I love you!

1162
01:15:09,680 --> 01:15:11,681
I've made arrangements for your biscuits.

1163
01:15:12,159 --> 01:15:13,764
You'll never have to
worry about them again.

1164
01:15:13,840 --> 01:15:15,524
You're the kindest master.

1165
01:15:15,600 --> 01:15:17,728
Just shush, OK? I can't concentrate.

1166
01:15:18,920 --> 01:15:22,925
- Master, don't you love me?
- I can't stand it, Dennis.

1167
01:15:23,640 --> 01:15:25,688
I just... I can't stand the responsibility.

1168
01:15:25,760 --> 01:15:28,569
You need to get that into
your stupid dog brain.

1169
01:15:28,720 --> 01:15:30,926
Neil!

1170
01:15:34,439 --> 01:15:36,328
I'll save you, master. Here I come!

1171
01:15:40,199 --> 01:15:44,329
Oh, wait a second. I can't swim.
Master, help! Woof!

1172
01:15:44,399 --> 01:15:48,882
Help! Help! Oh, dear. Woof! Woof!

1173
01:15:51,239 --> 01:15:53,890
Oh, there you are. Thank you, master.

1174
01:15:54,199 --> 01:15:56,009
Bless you!

1175
01:15:56,760 --> 01:15:58,921
You do love me, master.

1176
01:15:59,079 --> 01:16:02,606
Of course I love you, Dennis.
I just don't love myself.

1177
01:16:06,760 --> 01:16:10,162
Time's up! Prime the Destruction Generator.

1178
01:16:10,279 --> 01:16:11,520
- Hang on.
- What?

1179
01:16:11,560 --> 01:16:13,688
We need to check if he's passed the test.

1180
01:16:13,760 --> 01:16:17,923
- Well, he did start all those wars.
- That was good.

1181
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:21,560
- But then he stopped them all.
- But why?

1182
01:16:21,800 --> 01:16:25,930
He said he was trying to make things
better for people.

1183
01:16:27,119 --> 01:16:29,725
That's very appalling.

1184
01:16:30,039 --> 01:16:34,443
The only good is to destroy.
The only evil is weakness.

1185
01:16:34,520 --> 01:16:37,489
Weakness must be annihilated!

1186
01:16:38,199 --> 01:16:42,284
Agreed. Vaporize the earthling
and his wretched planet.

1187
01:16:43,319 --> 01:16:44,730
<i>I told you so.</i>

1188
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:47,770
Reprime the Destruction Generator.

1189
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:19,967
Try her again, Neil. Go on.

1190
01:17:20,039 --> 01:17:24,523
- She... She won't have me.
- Then, give up the powers.

1191
01:17:24,600 --> 01:17:27,409
- I can't.
- Then, give them to me.

1192
01:17:27,479 --> 01:17:30,768
You wouldn't have the powers
but you'd know where they were.

1193
01:17:31,319 --> 01:17:33,845
And being a dog,
all I want to do is follow orders.

1194
01:17:33,960 --> 01:17:35,724
I'll do what you tell me to.

1195
01:17:36,760 --> 01:17:39,524
- Dennis, you're a genius.
- Not bad, huh?

1196
01:17:42,199 --> 01:17:47,046
Destruction Generator already charged,
Death-Dealing Darkness-Bringer.

1197
01:17:49,960 --> 01:17:51,689
<i>Commencing destruction.</i>

1198
01:17:57,199 --> 01:18:00,408
It is a curse that our numerals
take so long to pronounce.

1199
01:18:01,039 --> 01:18:03,850
Uh, yeah, it's like, uh,
you just wave your hand, like that.

1200
01:18:03,920 --> 01:18:06,399
I feel it. Wow!

1201
01:18:06,560 --> 01:18:10,359
Yeah. There you go.
So what's it going to be? Biscuits?

1202
01:18:11,319 --> 01:18:12,810
But the power made you miserable.

1203
01:18:12,880 --> 01:18:16,440
Yeah, but I don't have them any more, do I?
Look, tree become Eiffel Tower.

1204
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:19,206
See?

1205
01:18:21,840 --> 01:18:24,127
What are you thinking, Dennis?

1206
01:18:33,359 --> 01:18:34,565
Forgive me, master.

1207
01:18:34,640 --> 01:18:36,359
What? Wait, wait. What are you going to do?

1208
01:18:37,840 --> 01:18:40,445
That's the only short one.

1209
01:18:42,399 --> 01:18:47,645
If I have any power, let the source
of that power be destroyed, forever!

1210
01:19:48,279 --> 01:19:51,090
All this marking be suddenly finished
and neatly stacked up.

1211
01:19:54,119 --> 01:19:56,042
Fiona Blackwell, go away.

1212
01:20:02,479 --> 01:20:04,641
Oh, shh, shh. Shush, shush, shush.

1213
01:20:05,840 --> 01:20:08,002
Fiona! How lovely to see you.

1214
01:20:09,920 --> 01:20:12,604
Hey, great news. I got my sight back.

1215
01:20:14,159 --> 01:20:16,480
Hey, I think I hear Catherine.

1216
01:20:21,479 --> 01:20:22,720
- Catherine.
- Hi.

1217
01:20:22,800 --> 01:20:26,805
Hey. Um, look. Letters become cucumbers.

1218
01:20:27,920 --> 01:20:29,967
Us be on the prow of the Titanic.

1219
01:20:30,840 --> 01:20:32,126
I got rid of the powers.

1220
01:20:33,560 --> 01:20:35,243
I'm impressed.

1221
01:20:36,560 --> 01:20:40,564
Yeah. So I thought maybe
we could have some dinner sometime?

1222
01:20:42,439 --> 01:20:45,807
- Yeah, maybe, yeah.
- OK.

1223
01:20:59,079 --> 01:21:02,527
- How about tonight?
<i>- I'll</i> be down in half an hour.

1224
01:21:09,840 --> 01:21:12,764
We're going out to dinner.
I'll bring you both back a doggy bag.

1225
01:21:13,199 --> 01:21:16,443
- I suppose I'd better keep my mouth shut.
- Turn me back, Den.

1226
01:21:16,520 --> 01:21:19,649
I can't. I like you as you are.
Those stubby legs. Look at you.

1227
01:21:19,720 --> 01:21:23,565
- I'm not a dog, I'm a man.
- Hey, nobody's perfect.

1228
01:22:15,960 --> 01:22:18,280
This is chewing a biscuit, boss.
I'll try and give you that right now,

1229
01:22:18,359 --> 01:22:19,565
hold one second.

1230
01:22:21,399 --> 01:22:23,368
Oh, red biscuit. Great.

1231
01:22:23,439 --> 01:22:25,841
No! No!

1232
01:22:29,439 --> 01:22:30,680
Oh, got it.

1233
01:22:30,760 --> 01:22:32,649
<i>Licking. Licking somebody.</i>

1234
01:22:34,319 --> 01:22:36,128
This is like porn. Now a shagging noise.

1235
01:22:39,720 --> 01:22:41,448
Oh, look. There's the red bit.

1236
01:22:43,159 --> 01:22:45,048
Oh, there, oh, right, oh...

1237
01:22:46,479 --> 01:22:47,527
I'm done.

1238
01:22:47,800 --> 01:22:49,643
<i>OK,</i> great.

1239
01:22:49,760 --> 01:22:52,001
That's enough chewing biscuits
for fucking half an hour.

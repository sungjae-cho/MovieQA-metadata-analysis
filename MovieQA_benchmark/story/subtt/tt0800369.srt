leave the bridge open for us?

[HEIMDALL]:
To leave the bridge open...

183
00:17:12,241 --> 00:17:14,403
would unleash
the full power of the Bifrost...

184
00:17:14,477 --> 00:17:17,468

[THOR]: There won't be a kingdom

257
00:27:40,845 --> 00:27:44,679
The Jotuns must learn to fear me,
just as they once feared you.

I'm so sorry.
I swear I'm not doing this on purpose.

360
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:31,516
(UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING)

361
00:35:46,771 --> 00:35:48,363
I got it, I got it.

362
00:35:58,183 --> 00:36:00,015
[MAN]: Come on, kick it in now!

363
00:36:03,088 --> 00:36:05,079
(ENGINE REVING)

364
00:36:07,258 --> 00:36:08,588
(ALL EXCLAIMING)

365
00:36:08,692 --> 00:36:09,886
Did it work?

366
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:11,223
(LAUGHING)

367
00:36:31,716 --> 00:36:33,809
Sir, we found it.

368
00:36:40,092 --> 00:36:44,426
You know, for a crazy homeless person,
he's pretty cut.

369
00:36:47,565 --> 00:36:49,557
Hey, sorry I tased you!

370
00:36:51,971 --> 00:36:53,961
Excuse me, excuse me!

371
00:37:01,313 --> 00:37:02,746
What is this?

372
00:37:03,615 --> 00:37:04,604
Oh.

373
00:37:05,651 --> 00:37:06,913
My ex.

374
00:37:07,453 --> 00:37:11,446
Good with patients
and bad with relationships.

375
00:37:12,458 --> 00:37:13,948
They're the only clothes I had
that would fit you.

376
00:37:14,026 --> 00:37:15,084
They will suffice.

377
00:37:16,162 --> 00:37:17,150
You're welcome.

378
00:37:17,262 --> 00:37:18,696
[THOR]:
This mortal form has grown weak.

379
00:37:19,598 --> 00:37:20,622
I need sustenance.

380
00:37:40,119 --> 00:37:41,677
We should never have let him go.

381
00:37:41,954 --> 00:37:43,445
There was no stopping him.

382
00:37:43,523 --> 00:37:45,490
[FANDRAL]: Well, at least
he's only banished, not dead.

383
00:37:45,558 --> 00:37:46,855
Which is what we'd all be...

384
00:37:46,959 --> 00:37:49,656
if that guard hadn't told Odin
where we'd gone.

385
00:37:56,037 --> 00:37:57,527
How did the guard even know?

386
00:37:58,038 --> 00:37:59,130
I told him.

387
00:38:00,574 --> 00:38:01,632
What?

388
00:38:01,708 --> 00:38:04,302
I told him to go to Odin after we'd left.

389
00:38:04,477 --> 00:38:05,808
He should be flogged for taking so long.

390
00:38:05,879 --> 00:38:07,403
We should never have
reached Jotunheim.

391
00:38:07,514 --> 00:38:08,538
You told the guard?

392
00:38:08,715 --> 00:38:10,649
I saved our lives.

393
00:38:10,717 --> 00:38:12,547
And Thor's.

394
00:38:12,651 --> 00:38:15,086
I had no idea Father would banish him
for what he did.

395
00:38:16,323 --> 00:38:17,313
Loki.

396
00:38:18,158 --> 00:38:20,854
You must go to the All father
and convince him to change his mind.

397
00:38:20,994 --> 00:38:23,554
And if I do, then what?

398
00:38:23,663 --> 00:38:26,495
I love Thor more dearly than any of you,
but you know what he is.

399
00:38:27,067 --> 00:38:29,694
He's arrogant.
He's reckless. He's dangerous.

400
00:38:29,768 --> 00:38:31,737
You saw how he was today.

401
00:38:32,038 --> 00:38:33,506
Is that what Asgard needs from its king?

402
00:38:38,078 --> 00:38:43,015
He may speak of the good of Asgard,
but he's always been jealous of Thor.

403
00:38:44,017 --> 00:38:46,177
We should be grateful to him,
he saved our lives.

404
00:38:46,418 --> 00:38:48,353
Laufey said...

405
00:38:48,421 --> 00:38:50,913
there were traitors in the House of Odin.

406
00:38:51,692 --> 00:38:55,856
A master of magic
could bring three Jotuns into Asgard.

407
00:38:57,698 --> 00:38:59,358
[FANDRAL]:
Loki's always been one for mischief,

408
00:38:59,432 --> 00:39:01,867
but you're talking
about something else entirely.

409
00:39:22,390 --> 00:39:23,721
[ODIN]: Stop!

410
00:39:27,395 --> 00:39:28,885
[LOKI]: Am I cursed?

411
00:39:29,230 --> 00:39:30,390
[ODIN]: No.

412
00:39:34,567 --> 00:39:35,728
What am I?

413
00:39:36,904 --> 00:39:38,236
You're my son.

414
00:39:48,416 --> 00:39:50,407
What more than that?

415
00:39:55,155 --> 00:39:57,818
The Casket wasn't the only thing
you took from Jotunheim that day,

416
00:39:57,925 --> 00:39:58,915
was it?

417
00:40:05,667 --> 00:40:06,998
No.

418
00:40:08,836 --> 00:40:10,168
In the aftermath of the battle,

419
00:40:10,272 --> 00:40:13,106
I went into the temple
and I found a baby.

420
00:40:13,276 --> 00:40:14,503
(CRYING)

421
00:40:17,612 --> 00:40:20,445
<i>Small for a giant's offspring.</i>

422
00:40:21,016 --> 00:40:23,780
<i>Abandoned, suffering, left to die.</i>

423
00:40:24,953 --> 00:40:26,443
<i>Laufey's son.</i>

424
00:40:28,289 --> 00:40:29,951
Laufey's son.

425
00:40:33,463 --> 00:40:34,793
Yes.

426
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:39,357
Why?

427
00:40:39,801 --> 00:40:43,134
You were knee-deep in Jotun blood,
why would you take me?

428
00:40:43,205 --> 00:40:44,695
You were an innocent child.

429
00:40:44,806 --> 00:40:48,799
No. You took me for a purpose.
What was it?

430
00:40:52,481 --> 00:40:54,472
(SHOUTING) Tell me!

431
00:40:56,151 --> 00:40:58,984
I thought
we could unite our kingdoms one day.

432
00:40:59,321 --> 00:41:02,380
Bring about an alliance,
bring about permanent peace.

433
00:41:02,723 --> 00:41:04,055
Through you.

434
00:41:04,159 --> 00:41:05,319
What?

435
00:41:06,328 --> 00:41:08,728
But those plans no longer matter.

436
00:41:10,333 --> 00:41:13,563
So I am no more
than another stolen relic,

437
00:41:13,668 --> 00:41:16,102
locked up here
until you might have use of me.

438
00:41:16,204 --> 00:41:17,672
Why do you twist my words?

439
00:41:17,740 --> 00:41:19,731
You could have told me what I was
from the beginning,

440
00:41:19,842 --> 00:41:20,832
why didn't you?

441
00:41:21,078 --> 00:41:22,238
You're my son.

442
00:41:22,845 --> 00:41:24,904
I wanted only to protect you
from the truth.

443
00:41:26,249 --> 00:41:28,012
Because I'm the monster

444
00:41:28,084 --> 00:41:30,177
parents tell their children about
at night?

445
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:32,354
- No, no.
- You know, it all makes sense now!

446
00:41:32,422 --> 00:41:35,186
Why you favored Thor all these years!

447
00:41:35,258 --> 00:41:38,126
Because no matter how much
you claim to love me,

448
00:41:38,594 --> 00:41:41,860
you could never have a Frost Giant
sitting on the throne of Asgard!

449
00:42:01,884 --> 00:42:03,215
Guards!

450
00:42:04,053 --> 00:42:06,214
Guards, please, help!

451
00:42:12,062 --> 00:42:13,790
[JANE]:
How'd you get inside that cloud?

452
00:42:14,063 --> 00:42:16,555
[DARCY]: Also, how could you eat
an entire box of Pop-Tarts...

453
00:42:16,633 --> 00:42:18,156
and still be this hungry?

454
00:42:23,973 --> 00:42:26,340
- This drink, I like it.
- I know. It's great, right?

455
00:42:26,443 --> 00:42:27,569
Another!

456
00:42:28,913 --> 00:42:30,641
[JANE]: Sorry, Izzy.
Little accident.

457
00:42:34,251 --> 00:42:36,310
- What was that?
- It was delicious. I want another.

458
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:38,615
- Well, you could have just said so.
- I just did.

459
00:42:38,755 --> 00:42:42,121
- No, I mean, ask nicely.
- I meant no disrespect.

460
00:42:42,191 --> 00:42:43,284
All right. Well, no more smashing.

461
00:42:43,794 --> 00:42:44,851
Deal?

462
00:42:47,331 --> 00:42:48,320
You have my word.

463
00:42:49,601 --> 00:42:50,625
Good.

464
00:42:52,002 --> 00:42:53,867
[MAN 1]: The usual, please, Izzy.

465
00:42:54,004 --> 00:42:56,495
[MAN 2]: You missed all the excitement
out at the crater.

466
00:42:56,940 --> 00:43:00,000
[MAN 1]: They're saying some kind
of satellite landed out in the desert.

467
00:43:00,110 --> 00:43:01,975
[MAN 2]: Yeah, we were having
a good time with it...

468
00:43:02,378 --> 00:43:03,779
until the Feds showed up.

469
00:43:03,848 --> 00:43:06,681
[JANE]: Excuse me.
Did you say there was a satellite crash?

470
00:43:06,784 --> 00:43:07,807
[MAN 2]: Yeah.

471
00:43:07,885 --> 00:43:10,319
Oh, my God. This is going on Facebook.
Smile.

472
00:43:12,689 --> 00:43:14,623
What did it look like, the satellite?

473
00:43:15,459 --> 00:43:18,359
I don't know anything about satellites,
but it was heavy.

474
00:43:19,128 --> 00:43:22,621
I mean, nobody could lift it.

475
00:43:22,699 --> 00:43:25,361
They said it was radioactive.
I had my hands all over it.

476
00:43:25,636 --> 00:43:27,127
Which way?

477
00:43:29,307 --> 00:43:31,298
Fifty miles west of here.

478
00:43:31,643 --> 00:43:33,337
[MAN 1]:
Well, I wouldn't waste my time!

479
00:43:33,410 --> 00:43:35,174
Looked like the whole Army
was coming when we left.

00:43:40,251 --> 00:43:41,582
[DRIVER]: Dumbass!

482
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:43,750
Where are you going?

483
00:43:44,155 --> 00:43:46,180
- Fifty miles west of here.
- Why?

484
00:43:46,257 --> 00:43:49,658
- To get what belongs to me.
- Oh, so you own a satellite now?

485
00:43:49,727 --> 00:43:50,716
It's not what they say it is.

486
00:43:50,828 --> 00:43:51,852
Well, whatever it is,

487
00:43:51,930 --> 00:43:53,260
the government seems to think
it's theirs.

488
00:43:53,363 --> 00:43:55,389
So, you just intend to go in there
and take it?

489
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:56,558
Yes.

490
00:43:58,037 --> 00:43:59,230
If you take me there now,

491
00:43:59,337 --> 00:44:00,999
I'll tell you everything you wish to know.

492
00:44:01,373 --> 00:44:02,566
- Everything?
- Yes.

493
00:44:02,674 --> 00:44:05,438
All the answers you seek will be yours
once I reclaim Mjolnir.

494
00:44:05,543 --> 00:44:07,567
Myeu-muh? What's Myeu-muh?

495
00:44:07,679 --> 00:44:09,613
Can I have a word, Jane?

496
00:44:13,685 --> 00:44:15,175
Please don't do this.

497
00:44:15,587 --> 00:44:17,349
(SOFTLY)
You saw what I saw last night.

498
00:44:17,421 --> 00:44:19,856
This is no coincidence.
We have to find out what's in that crater.

499
00:44:19,924 --> 00:44:21,892
But I'm not talking about the crater,
I'm talking about him.

500
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:24,689
- But he's promising us the answers.
- He's delusional.

501
00:44:24,762 --> 00:44:25,786
Listen to what he's saying.

502
00:44:25,897 --> 00:44:29,799
He's talking about Mjolnir
and Thor and Bifrost.

503
00:44:30,134 --> 00:44:32,365
It's the stories I grew up with as a child.

504
00:44:32,438 --> 00:44:35,271
I'm just going to drive him. That's it.

505
00:44:35,474 --> 00:44:37,465
He's dangerous, Jane.

506
00:44:43,415 --> 00:44:46,317
I'm sorry, but I can't take you.

507
00:44:46,419 --> 00:44:47,885
Then this is where we say goodbye.

509
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:55,550
Um...

510
00:44:58,329 --> 00:44:59,991
Thank you?

511
00:45:00,765 --> 00:45:02,496
Jane Foster,

00:45:02,602 --> 00:45:04,159
Erik Selvig,

513
00:45:04,269 --> 00:45:05,760
Darcy,

514
00:45:05,972 --> 00:45:07,303
farewell.

515
00:45:10,943 --> 00:45:12,273
All right.

516
00:45:12,945 --> 00:45:14,502
Back to work.

517
00:45:30,929 --> 00:45:32,260
(TRUCK HONKING)

518
00:45:33,432 --> 00:45:34,864
Hey!

519
00:45:34,966 --> 00:45:36,526
That's my stuff!

520
00:45:41,274 --> 00:45:42,535
What the hell is going on here?

521
00:45:42,641 --> 00:45:44,632
Ms. Foster,
I'm Agent Coulson with S.H.I.E.L.D.

522
00:45:44,710 --> 00:45:46,371
Is that supposed to mean something
to me?

523
00:45:46,478 --> 00:45:47,776
- You can't do this!
- Jane!

524
00:45:48,148 --> 00:45:50,981
Jane, this is a lot more serious
than you realize. Let it go.

525
00:45:51,051 --> 00:45:53,109
Let it go? This is my life.

526
00:45:53,352 --> 00:45:55,446
We're investigating a security threat.

527
00:45:55,522 --> 00:45:58,218
We need to appropriate your records
and all your atmospheric data.

528
00:45:58,324 --> 00:46:00,724
By "appropriate," do you mean steal?

529
00:46:00,827 --> 00:46:02,522
Here, this should
more than compensate you

530
00:46:02,629 --> 00:46:03,618
for your trouble.

531
00:46:03,731 --> 00:46:06,290
I can't just buy replacements
at Radio Shack,

532
00:46:06,366 --> 00:46:08,061
I made most of this equipment myself!

533
00:46:08,168 --> 00:46:09,498

Pakistan? Chechnya?
Afghanistan?

707
01:01:48,689 --> 01:01:51,954
No, you strike me
more as the soldier of fortune type.

708
01:01:52,792 --> 01:01:55,625
Where was it? South Africa?

709
01:01:57,130 --> 01:02:01,032
Certain groups pay very well
for a good mercenary like you.

710
01:02:03,369 --> 01:02:04,801
Who are you?

711
01:02:09,710 --> 01:02:12,177
One way or another,
we find out what we need to know.

712
01:02:12,546 --> 01:02:13,842
We're good at that.

Loki! What are you doing here?

716
01:02:30,229 --> 01:02:31,719
I had to see you.

717
01:02:33,399 --> 01:02:34,730
What's happened?

718
01:02:35,068 --> 01:02:37,059
Tell me. Is it Jotunheim?

719
01:02:37,403 --> 01:02:38,835
Let me explain to Father.

720
01:02:38,904 --> 01:02:40,236
Father is dead.

721
01:02:46,412 --> 01:02:47,743
What?

722
01:02:49,582 --> 01:02:51,244
Your banishment,

723
01:02:52,251 --> 01:02:54,413
the threat of a new war,

724
01:02:55,522 --> 01:02:57,252
it was too much for him to bear.

725
01:02:59,927 --> 01:03:02,088
You mustn't blame yourself.

726
01:03:02,929 --> 01:03:04,420
I know that you loved him.

727
01:03:05,365 --> 01:03:08,095
I tried to tell him so,
but he wouldn't listen.

728
01:03:10,337 --> 01:03:12,600
It was so cruel
to put the hammer within your reach,

729
01:03:12,705 --> 01:03:14,674
knowing that you could never lift it.

730
01:03:18,012 --> 01:03:20,241
The burden of the throne
has fallen to me now.

731
01:03:26,853 --> 01:03:28,515
Can I come home?

732
01:03:29,423 --> 01:03:32,416
The truce with Jotunheim
is conditional upon your exile.

733
01:03:32,760 --> 01:03:38,892
- Yes, but couldn't we find a way...
- And Mother has forbidden your return.

734
01:03:42,236 --> 01:03:43,862
This is goodbye, Brother.

735
01:03:46,272 --> 01:03:48,208
I'm so sorry.

736
01:03:53,781 --> 01:03:54,942
No.

737
01:03:56,451 --> 01:03:58,112
I am sorry.

738
01:04:03,558 --> 01:04:05,789
Thank you for coming here.

739
01:04:10,298 --> 01:04:11,628
Farewell.

740

Goodbye.

741
01:04:26,982 --> 01:04:27,970
Goodbye?

742
01:04:28,583 --> 01:04:29,914
I just got back.

His name is Donald Blake?

Dr. Donald Blake.

749
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:20,163
You have dangerous coworkers,
Dr. Selvig.

750
01:05:20,469 --> 01:05:24,303
He was distraught when he found out
that you've taken all our research.

751
01:05:24,874 --> 01:05:27,365
That was years of his life, gone!

752
01:05:29,310 --> 01:05:31,643
You can understand
how a man could go off like that.

A big, faceless organization like yours

jackbooted thugs and...

755
01:05:38,387 --> 01:05:39,820
That's how he put it.

756
01:05:39,988 --> 01:05:41,013
That still doesn't explain

757
01:05:41,090 --> 01:05:42,716

to tear through our security.

It says here that he's an M.D.

Well, he is! Or he was.

763

He switched careers
and became a physicist.

764
01:06:00,608 --> 01:06:02,406
A brilliant physicist.

He's a man in pain.

I will!

- To get a drink.

You know, I had it all backwards.

774

I had it all wrong.

775
01:06:57,734 --> 01:07:01,397
It's not a bad thing finding out
that you don't have all the answers.

776
01:07:01,804 --> 01:07:03,636
You start asking the right questions.

777
01:07:07,811 --> 01:07:11,803
For the first time in my life,

778
01:07:11,914 --> 01:07:16,512
I have no idea what I'm supposed to do.

Anyone who's ever going to
find his way in this world

780
01:07:20,623 --> 01:07:23,752
has to start by admitting
he doesn't know where the hell he is.

01:07:25,662 --> 01:07:27,255
Thank you for what you've done.

782
01:07:27,358 --> 01:07:29,691
No, don't thank me. I only did it for Jane.

783
01:07:31,262 --> 01:07:33,924
Her father and I
taught at university together.

01:07:34,265 --> 01:07:35,856

He never listened.

786
01:07:39,270 --> 01:07:40,862
Neither did I.

787
01:07:42,106 --> 01:07:44,199
My father
was trying to teach me something,

788
01:07:44,275 --> 01:07:46,208
but I was too stupid to see it.

01:07:47,278 --> 01:07:51,306
I don't know if you're delusional
or if you're pulling some kind of con,

791
01:07:52,817 --> 01:07:54,148
I just care about her.

792
01:07:55,553 --> 01:07:57,953
I've seen the way she looks at you.

793
01:08:01,292 --> 01:08:03,887
I swear to you, I mean her no harm.

794
01:08:04,129 --> 01:08:05,118
Good.

So you're the one
who showed us the way into Asgard.

800
01:09:20,906 --> 01:09:23,067
That was just a bit of fun, really.

801
01:09:24,243 --> 01:09:27,234
To ruin my brother's big day.

802
01:09:28,079 --> 01:09:31,914
And to protect the realm
from his idiotic rule for a while longer.

803

I will hear you.

804
01:09:38,991 --> 01:09:43,429
I will conceal you
and a handful of your soldiers,

805
01:09:44,097 --> 01:09:49,091
lead you into Odin's chambers,
and you can slay him where he lies.

01:09:49,537 --> 01:09:51,231
Why not kill him yourself?

would not take kindly

to a king who had murdered
his predecessor.

Once Odin is dead,
I will return the Casket to you

811

and you can return Jotunheim to all its...

813
01:10:13,192 --> 01:10:14,524
I...

814
01:10:16,028 --> 01:10:17,860
Accept.

815
01:10:23,704 --> 01:10:25,261
What troubles you, Gatekeeper?

816
01:10:25,538 --> 01:10:30,533
I turned my gaze upon you in Jotunheim,
but could neither see you nor hear you.

817
01:10:31,211 --> 01:10:32,439
You were shrouded from me,

818
01:10:32,545 --> 01:10:34,706
like the Frost Giants
that entered this realm.

819
01:10:35,048 --> 01:10:38,381
Perhaps your senses have weakened
after your many years of service.

820
01:10:38,451 --> 01:10:40,112
Or perhaps someone has found a way

821
01:10:40,220 --> 01:10:43,280
to hide that
which he does not wish me to see.

822
01:10:44,557 --> 01:10:46,617
You have great power, Heimdall.

823
01:10:49,129 --> 01:10:50,619
Did Odin ever fear you?

824
01:10:52,900 --> 01:10:54,562
- No.
- And why is that?

825
01:10:54,803 --> 01:10:57,897
Because he is my king
and I am sworn to obey him.

826
01:10:58,239 --> 01:11:02,403
He was your king
and you're sworn to obey me now.

827
01:11:03,244 --> 01:11:04,302
Yes?

828
01:11:09,816 --> 01:11:11,147
Yes.

829
01:11:11,852 --> 01:11:14,582
Then you will open the Bifrost to no one

830
01:11:14,655 --> 01:11:17,488

that my brother has done.

But you ought to be.

842
01:12:13,548 --> 01:12:15,038
Are these your chambers?

843
01:12:15,483 --> 01:12:19,145
It's more of a temporary living situation.

844
01:12:19,989 --> 01:12:23,823
I'm sorry. I don't usually have guests.

845
01:12:24,493 --> 01:12:27,325
Actually, I never have guests.

I'm sorry.

Yes, of course.

850
01:12:46,248 --> 01:12:48,546
I come up here sometimes
when I can't sleep

851
01:12:48,617 --> 01:12:52,746
or I'm trying to reconcile particle data,
or when Darcy's driving me crazy.

852
01:12:54,023 --> 01:12:57,356
I come up here a lot, actually,
now that I think about it.

I'm really glad you're safe.

854
01:13:04,367 --> 01:13:06,857
You've been very kind to me,

855
01:13:07,570 --> 01:13:09,765
and I've been far less grateful
than you deserve.

856
01:13:09,939 --> 01:13:11,635
Well, I hit you with my car
a couple times,

857
01:13:11,742 --> 01:13:13,766
so I think that kind of evens things out.

858
01:13:16,212 --> 01:13:18,043
Perhaps I had it coming.

01:13:26,454 --> 01:13:27,787
I don't believe it!

861
01:13:28,058 --> 01:13:31,459
It was all I could get back.
I'm sorry it's not as much as I promised.

862
01:13:31,561 --> 01:13:36,224
No, no, this is great! This is...
I don't have to start from scratch now.

Whatever they are,

867
01:13:49,312 --> 01:13:50,939
they're gonna do
everything in their power

868

to make sure this research
never sees the light of day.

870
01:13:55,818 --> 01:13:57,752
Listen to me. You must not give up.

871
01:13:57,986 --> 01:13:59,978
- You must finish what you've started.
- Why?

872
01:14:00,255 --> 01:14:01,815
Because you're right.

873
01:14:02,326 --> 01:14:03,656
Here, look.

874
01:14:06,263 --> 01:14:09,754
Your ancestors called it magic,
and you call it science.

875
01:14:10,334 --> 01:14:13,098
Well, I come from a place
where they're one and the same thing.

876
01:14:27,684 --> 01:14:29,277
What is that?

877
01:14:30,287 --> 01:14:33,381
My father explained it to me like this,

878
01:14:33,490 --> 01:14:35,218
that your world

879
01:14:35,324 --> 01:14:38,158
is one of the Nine Realms
of the Cosmos,

880
01:14:38,228 --> 01:14:41,220
linked to each other
by the branches of Yggdrasil,

01:31:59,183 --> 01:32:01,515
I will return for you.

1061
01:32:09,093 --> 01:32:10,287
Deal?

1062
01:32:23,875 --> 01:32:25,206
Deal.

1063
01:32:41,593 --> 01:32:43,719
Get him to the healing room!

1064
01:32:45,130 --> 01:32:46,721
Leave my brother to me.

1065
01:33:11,590 --> 01:33:13,080
[LAUFEY]: It's said...

1066
01:33:13,425 --> 01:33:18,089
you can still hear and see
what transpires around you.

1067
01:33:19,431 --> 01:33:21,593
I hope it's true,

1068
01:33:23,435 --> 01:33:25,597
so that you may know...

1069
01:33:26,606 --> 01:33:30,542
your death came at the hand...

1070
01:33:31,443 --> 01:33:32,775
of Laufey.

1071
01:33:41,854 --> 01:33:44,379
And your death came
by the son of Odin.

01:33:51,730 --> 01:33:53,221
You saved him!

1075
01:33:57,703 --> 01:34:00,002
I swear to you, Mother,

1076
01:34:00,073 --> 01:34:02,541
that they will pay for what
they've done today.

1077
01:34:02,910 --> 01:34:03,967
[THOR]: Loki.

1078
01:34:04,710 --> 01:34:05,801
Thor!

1079
01:34:06,812 --> 01:34:08,711
I knew you'd return to us.

1080
01:34:14,321 --> 01:34:15,753
Why don't you tell her

1081
01:34:15,988 --> 01:34:19,479
how you sent the Destroyer
to kill our friends, to kill me?

1082
01:34:19,559 --> 01:34:20,548
What?

1083
01:34:20,660 --> 01:34:23,061
Why, it must have been enforcing
Father's last command.

1084
01:34:23,163 --> 01:34:26,028
You're a talented liar, Brother.
Always have been.

1085
01:34:26,666 --> 01:34:27,894
It's good to have you back.

1086
01:34:28,333 --> 01:34:31,895
Now if you'll excuse me,
I have to destroy Jotunheim.

1087
01:35:13,480 --> 01:35:14,811
[LOKI]: You can't stop it.

1088
01:35:14,915 --> 01:35:18,248
The Bifrost will build until
it rips Jotunheim apart.

1089

(FROST GIANTS SCREAMING)

01:35:40,107 --> 01:35:41,267
Jane?

1091
01:35:43,243 --> 01:35:44,733
Why have you done this?

1092
01:35:44,979 --> 01:35:48,745
To prove to Father
that I am the worthy son.

1093
01:35:48,816 --> 01:35:51,649
When he wakes,
I will have saved his life.

1094
01:35:51,753 --> 01:35:54,448
I will have destroyed that
race of monsters.

1095
01:35:54,521 --> 01:35:56,650
And I will be true heir to the throne!

1096
01:35:57,025 --> 01:35:59,016
You can't kill an entire race!

1097
01:35:59,127 --> 01:36:00,458
Why not?

1098
01:36:03,264 --> 01:36:06,495
And what is this newfound love
for the Frost Giants?

1099
01:36:07,502 --> 01:36:10,937
You could have killed them all
with your bare hands.

1100
01:36:11,004 --> 01:36:13,098
- I've changed.
- So have I.

1101
01:36:14,842 --> 01:36:16,333
Now fight me.

1102
01:36:19,281 --> 01:36:21,180
I never wanted the throne!

1103
01:36:22,517 --> 01:36:24,347
I only ever wanted to be your equal.

1104
01:36:25,185 --> 01:36:27,177
I will not fight you, Brother!

1105
01:36:27,288 --> 01:36:28,686
I'm not your brother.

1106
01:36:29,458 --> 01:36:30,720
I never was.

1107

Loki, this is madness.

1108
01:36:32,895 --> 01:36:34,521
Is it madness?

01:36:35,362 --> 01:36:36,523
Is it?

Is it?

1111
01:36:40,301 --> 01:36:44,294
Come on. What happened to you
on Earth that turned you so soft?

1112
01:36:45,072 --> 01:36:47,803
Don't tell me it was that woman.

1113
01:36:48,042 --> 01:36:49,202
Oh!

1114
01:36:49,812 --> 01:36:51,006
It was!

1115
01:36:51,080 --> 01:36:55,210
Well, maybe, when we're finished here,
I'll pay her a visit myself!

Do you hear me, Brother?
There's nothing you can do!

1129

What are you doing?

And then, with a mighty bellow,

I flew into the giant metal creature

you fell on your huge ass?

was a tactic lulling the Destroyer...

they're taking me down here to kill me.

Power, Doctor.

If we can figure out how to tap it,

01:54:20,777 --> 01:54:22,266
maybe unlimited power.

1189
01:54:28,051 --> 01:54:30,280
Well, I guess that's worth a look.

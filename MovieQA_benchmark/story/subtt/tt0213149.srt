German bandits at two o'clock!

00:01:01,298 --> 00:01:02,633
Increase throttle! Power dive!

00:01:07,969 --> 00:01:10,180
DANNY: Spell it right, Rafe.

6
00:01:10,305 --> 00:01:13,723
"Rudder" is spelled with two Ds.

7
00:01:13,849 --> 00:01:15,767

- Yeah, sure.

Crack shootin', Rafe.

13
00:01:23,188 --> 00:01:25,148

I'm gonna teach you how to fly.

DANNY: I get the front!

20
00:01:59,713 --> 00:02:01,048
RAFE: No, you take the back.

21
00:02:01,131 --> 00:02:03,299
I'm bigger,
and I should be in front.

22
00:02:03,382 --> 00:02:05,592
I'm older,
and I'm teachin', so no.

23
00:02:05,676 --> 00:02:07,552
Wow.
It's like we're really flying.

24
00:02:07,635 --> 00:02:08,969
Yeah, I did it lots of times.

25
00:02:09,053 --> 00:02:10,471
Come on, you man the guns.

26
00:02:10,554 --> 00:02:11,930
I'll give her some throttle.

27
00:02:12,013 --> 00:02:13,973

you spend time playing...

you ain't never goin'
to amount to nothin'!

Daddy, no!

66
00:03:51,789 --> 00:03:54,124
I will bust you open,
you dirty German!

67
00:03:54,208 --> 00:03:56,626
What'd you call me?

[Panting]

69
00:03:58,502 --> 00:04:01,546
I fought the Germans in France.

70
00:04:01,629 --> 00:04:05,590
And I fought 'em
in the trenches.

71
00:04:05,673 --> 00:04:07,800
And I pray to God
no one ever has to see...

72
00:04:07,884 --> 00:04:09,217
the things that I saw.

73
00:04:25,603 --> 00:04:28,147
You're my bestfriend.

74
00:04:29,981 --> 00:04:32,067
DANNY: Daddy, wait!

75
00:04:34,026 --> 00:04:35,777
Daddy, wait.

NEWSREEL NARRATOR:
Adolf Hitler...

77
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:43,699
NEWSREEL NARRATOR:
Adolf Hitler...

78
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:45,742
builds the German
military machine...

79
00:04:45,825 --> 00:04:47,869
and drags
all of Europe into war.

80
00:04:47,952 --> 00:04:50,287
But even while France
falls to Hitler...

81
00:04:50,328 --> 00:04:53,081
America still refuses
to join the fighting.

82
00:05:11,384 --> 00:05:13,470
- Where's McCawley and Walker?
- Still training, sir.

83
00:05:15,179 --> 00:05:17,222
RAFE: Allright, Danny.
Now let's show 'em how to fly.

84
00:05:17,305 --> 00:05:18,682
We're gonna play chicken.
You ready?

85
00:05:18,723 --> 00:05:21,016
DANNY: This ain't the farm,
and these ain't no cropdusters.

86
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:22,226
I'm not playing
chicken with you.

87
00:05:22,309 --> 00:05:23,768
Now don't be a baby.
I'll tell you what-

88
00:05:23,851 --> 00:05:26,187
- I'm not doing it, Rafe.
- Well, I'm coming right at you.

89
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:27,937
You can turn, or you can hit me.
It's up to you.

90
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:32,065
What the-

91
00:05:32,148 --> 00:05:33,316
Oh, boy.

92
00:05:36,652 --> 00:05:38,945
Why you always
bustin' my ass, Rafe?

93
00:05:39,029 --> 00:05:40,279
Which way you goin'?

94
00:05:42,239 --> 00:05:44,991
I guess I'll go right.
No, uh, left. I'll go left.

95
00:05:47,368 --> 00:05:48,576
OK, we're goin' left, right?

96
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:49,952
RAFE: Ri-uh, right. Right?

97
00:05:50,036 --> 00:05:52,038
Right like we're goin' right,
or right like we're goin' left?

98
00:05:52,121 --> 00:05:53,663
Well, now you got me
all mixed up!

99
00:05:53,705 --> 00:05:55,707
I don't know.
Make up your mind.

100
00:05:58,041 --> 00:06:01,002
God, Rafe, we're going right!
Righty-tighty!

101
00:06:01,044 --> 00:06:03,212
DANNY: Aah!

102
00:06:03,295 --> 00:06:04,546
[Cheering]

103
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:08,257
- Whoo-hoo!
- Whoo-hoo-hoo!

104
00:06:10,758 --> 00:06:12,718
Those are some smooth aces.

105
00:06:12,843 --> 00:06:14,886
Did you say something?

106
00:06:15,011 --> 00:06:17,180
'Cause let me tell ya,
those farm boys are grounded!

107
00:06:17,263 --> 00:06:19,514
Yes, sir, an entirely
unacceptable use...

108
00:06:19,598 --> 00:06:22,266
of m-m-military aircraft, sir.

109
00:06:23,725 --> 00:06:25,185
- Get my hat.
- Yes, sir.

110
00:06:25,227 --> 00:06:28,270
Get those hedge-hoppers
in Doolittle's office.

111
00:06:28,354 --> 00:06:30,688
After two years of training...

112
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:33,065
you believe that
a $45,000 airplane...

113
00:06:33,149 --> 00:06:34,608
is there for your amusement?

114
00:06:34,691 --> 00:06:35,900
RAFE: No, sir.
I was just trying...

115
00:06:35,984 --> 00:06:37,235
to keep my edge, Major.

116
00:06:37,318 --> 00:06:39,110
And when you did
the outside loop last week...

117
00:06:39,194 --> 00:06:41,613
what did you think that was?
Honing your skills?

118
00:06:41,696 --> 00:06:42,906
DOOLITTLE:
That's not training, McCawley.

119
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:44,197
That's a stunt.

120
00:06:44,323 --> 00:06:46,533
And I personally
consider it to be reckless...

121
00:06:46,616 --> 00:06:50,077
and irresponsible.

122
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,328
Major...

123
00:06:54,038 --> 00:06:55,289
How could that be,
when you're famous...

124
00:06:55,372 --> 00:06:57,040
for being the first man
in the world ever to do it?

125
00:06:57,081 --> 00:06:58,207
Don't get cute with me, son.

126
00:06:58,291 --> 00:07:00,750
No, sir, I don't mean
to be disrespectful.

127
00:07:00,792 --> 00:07:03,545
I just think that-
well, I-

128
00:07:03,628 --> 00:07:04,795
It is reckless
and irresponsible...

129
00:07:04,878 --> 00:07:06,088
if you're just doing it
to be a show-off.

130
00:07:06,171 --> 00:07:09,798
But I was doing it to try
to inspire the men, sir...

131
00:07:09,882 --> 00:07:11,175
in the way that
you've inspired me.

132
00:07:11,258 --> 00:07:13,342
I believe the French
even have a word for that...

133
00:07:13,426 --> 00:07:15,219
when the men get together
to honor their leaders.

134
00:07:15,261 --> 00:07:16,594
They call it an homage, sir.

135
00:07:16,719 --> 00:07:18,513
- A what?
- An homage, sir.

136
00:07:18,596 --> 00:07:20,223
That's bullshit, McCawley!

137
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:26,601
But it's very,
very good bullshit.

138
00:07:26,726 --> 00:07:27,853
Thank you, sir.

139
00:07:27,936 --> 00:07:30,604
[Clicking teeth]

140
00:07:30,687 --> 00:07:34,315
McCawley, you remind me
of myself fifteen years ago.

141
00:07:34,398 --> 00:07:36,358
Which is why we need
to discuss this.

142
00:07:36,442 --> 00:07:38,401
Have a seat, son.

143
00:07:46,114 --> 00:07:48,908
The British have accepted you
into the Eagle Squadron.

144
00:07:48,992 --> 00:07:51,368
You're on your way
to England tomorrow...

145
00:07:51,451 --> 00:07:53,537
if you still want to go.

146
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:56,080
Huh. Wow.

147
00:07:56,121 --> 00:07:58,082
Just a few British pilots
are all that stand...

148
00:07:58,123 --> 00:08:00,458
between Hitler
and total victory in Europe.

149
00:08:00,541 --> 00:08:02,543
They're gonna need
all the help they can get.

150
00:08:02,625 --> 00:08:04,002
Yes, sir.
Well, I'm on my way.

151
00:08:04,085 --> 00:08:06,421
Just for the record...

152
00:08:06,462 --> 00:08:08,338
I'm supposed to ask you
to reconsider.

153
00:08:08,421 --> 00:08:09,923
Sir?

154
00:08:10,006 --> 00:08:11,965
Sooner or later
we're gonna be in this war...

155
00:08:12,007 --> 00:08:13,967
whether we like it or not.

156
00:08:14,051 --> 00:08:16,343
And I'm gonna need
all of my best pilots.

157
00:08:16,427 --> 00:08:19,221
So it's my duty
to ask you to stay.

158
00:08:19,304 --> 00:08:22,431
Major, what would you do?

159
00:08:24,807 --> 00:08:26,476
If it was me...

160
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:30,770
I'd go.

161
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:33,188
Get out. Am I going bald
right back here?

162
00:08:33,271 --> 00:08:34,398
Ooh!

163
00:08:34,481 --> 00:08:37,691
Man, I am one good-lookin'
son of a bitch.

164
00:08:37,775 --> 00:08:39,359
Don't you ever die.

165
00:08:39,443 --> 00:08:42,028
[Snaps fingers]
Die. That's exactly...

166
00:08:42,111 --> 00:08:45,113
the concept
you gotta work tonight.

167
00:08:45,196 --> 00:08:48,616
You put a drop of this clove oil
under your eyes...

168
00:08:48,658 --> 00:08:50,658
and you let 'em sting
and well up.

169
00:08:50,742 --> 00:08:54,077
You get your nurse alone,
take a breath...

170
00:08:54,161 --> 00:08:56,496
let her see your eyes glisten...

171
00:08:56,580 --> 00:09:00,999
and say, "Baby,
they're training me for war...

172
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:03,959
"and I don't know
what'll happen...

173
00:09:04,001 --> 00:09:07,253
"but if I die tomorrow,
I want to know...

174
00:09:07,336 --> 00:09:11,297
"that we lived
all we could tonight."

175
00:09:11,339 --> 00:09:13,299
Come on, guys!
We got nurses waitin'.

176
00:09:13,341 --> 00:09:16,134
PILOT: Come on, before the rest
of his hair falls out.

177
00:09:16,218 --> 00:09:19,678
How could you do this?

178
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,221
Well, Doolittle assigned me.

179
00:09:21,305 --> 00:09:24,515
He wanted me to get some real-
real combat training in.

180
00:09:24,598 --> 00:09:25,724
Well, guess what?

181
00:09:25,808 --> 00:09:27,975
It's not training over there.
It's war.

182
00:09:28,017 --> 00:09:30,269
Where the losers die,
and there aren't any winners-

183
00:09:30,352 --> 00:09:31,478
just guys who turn
into broken-down wrecks...

184
00:09:31,603 --> 00:09:32,687
like my father.

185
00:09:32,812 --> 00:09:33,980
Yeah, I understand that, Danny.

186
00:09:34,063 --> 00:09:35,313
But I feel like
I got a duty to go.

187
00:09:35,397 --> 00:09:37,399
Don't preach to me
about duty, damn it.

188
00:09:37,524 --> 00:09:39,316
I wear the same uniform you do.

189
00:09:39,358 --> 00:09:42,152
Now, if trouble wants me,
I'm ready for it.

190
00:09:42,235 --> 00:09:43,360
But why go looking for it?

191
00:09:43,444 --> 00:09:45,487
God, Danny, come on.

192
00:09:45,571 --> 00:09:47,947
I'm gonna be twenty-five.
I might as well be an old man.

193
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:50,032
They're gonna have me bein'
a flight instructor.

194
00:09:50,116 --> 00:09:52,533
I don't wanna teach
loops and barrel rolls.

195
00:09:52,575 --> 00:09:53,868
I wanna be a combat fighter.

196
00:09:53,951 --> 00:09:55,077
PILOT: Hey, come on!

197
00:09:55,161 --> 00:09:58,288
The nurses can't
d- d-dance by themselves.

198
00:09:58,371 --> 00:10:00,080
Let's go.

199
00:10:02,874 --> 00:10:04,583
[Whistle blows]

200
00:10:09,211 --> 00:10:11,922
WOMAN: If the call of duty
means seeing 150 men...

201
00:10:12,006 --> 00:10:13,464
in their underwear every day...

202
00:10:13,548 --> 00:10:14,799
we are here to serve.

203
00:10:14,882 --> 00:10:16,008
[Giggling]

204
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:17,217
I can't believe it.

205
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:19,302
Saturday night
in New York City.

206
00:10:19,385 --> 00:10:21,011
Do you know what they're doing
where I come from?

207
00:10:21,053 --> 00:10:22,471
Nothing.

208
00:10:22,554 --> 00:10:24,306
Cow-tipping.

209
00:10:24,389 --> 00:10:25,556
Well, that's why
you joined the Navy, hon'.

210
00:10:25,639 --> 00:10:27,850
To get out of that dusty
little town and see the world.

211
00:10:27,891 --> 00:10:30,518
May I remind you, Barbara,
we're Navy nurses, not tourists.

212
00:10:30,601 --> 00:10:33,354
I joined to do
my patriotic duty and...

213
00:10:33,437 --> 00:10:35,605
to meet guys.

214
00:10:35,688 --> 00:10:37,064
Me, too.

215
00:10:37,189 --> 00:10:38,857
Girls, we're gonna have
so much fun tonight in the city.

216
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:40,400
You've gotta tell them
the story, Evelyn.

217
00:10:40,525 --> 00:10:42,401
What?

218
00:10:42,442 --> 00:10:43,610
Oh, come on. Tell us.

219
00:10:43,735 --> 00:10:45,195
Oh, it's such a long story.

220
00:10:45,278 --> 00:10:47,237
We got time.

221
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:49,114
I saw it happen.

222
00:10:49,197 --> 00:10:50,281
EVELYN: Well, it was
about four weeks ago...

223
00:10:50,333 --> 00:10:51,365
EVELYN: Well, it was
about four weeks ago...

224
00:10:51,449 --> 00:10:53,492
What do you think
is b-b-better?

225
00:10:53,575 --> 00:10:55,910
All in the one cheek,
or spreading them out?

226
00:10:57,244 --> 00:10:58,371
OK.

227
00:10:58,412 --> 00:11:00,747
Fusco, Anthony.

228
00:11:05,542 --> 00:11:07,376
You all right, buddy?

229
00:11:07,417 --> 00:11:09,628
Sweetie, do you really
have to do this?

230
00:11:09,711 --> 00:11:12,713
I'm not gonna get yellow fever
in my barracks.

231
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:15,798
No? If you'd rather,
she can do it.

232
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:20,301
[Inhales sharply]

233
00:11:20,385 --> 00:11:22,720
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Just gimme a minute.

234
00:11:22,762 --> 00:11:26,056
[Sighs] Honey, the government
says stick 'em, we stick 'em.

235
00:11:26,097 --> 00:11:27,307
Uh!

236
00:11:30,308 --> 00:11:31,726
RAFE: Hey, Red, you allright?

237
00:11:34,186 --> 00:11:37,521
EVELYN: Eye exam number four?

238
00:11:37,605 --> 00:11:41,190
MAN: Listen, Doc, I have passed
a dozen medical checks.

239
00:11:41,274 --> 00:11:43,443
You write that,
they won't let me fly.

240
00:11:43,526 --> 00:11:45,986
Sorry, son.

241
00:11:46,069 --> 00:11:47,445
I'm gonna fail.

242
00:11:47,529 --> 00:11:49,071
They're gonna
take my wings away.

243
00:11:49,196 --> 00:11:51,406
No, they won't. Just relax.

244
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:52,991
Read the bottom line, please.

245
00:11:53,115 --> 00:11:54,408
Just keep practicin'
the bottom line.

246
00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:56,243
And don't worry.
I'm right behind you.

247
00:11:56,326 --> 00:11:59,078
J- L-M-K-P-O-

248
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,038
[Muttering]

249
00:12:02,955 --> 00:12:04,540
Next.

250
00:12:04,624 --> 00:12:05,999
Ma'am.

251
00:12:09,085 --> 00:12:12,045
J- L-M-K-P-O-E-T-X.

252
00:12:12,128 --> 00:12:13,546
Eyes like an eagle, ma'am.

253
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:15,464
Slow down, flyboy.

254
00:12:15,547 --> 00:12:18,257
And, instead of the bottom,
read the very top. Both eyes.

255
00:12:18,341 --> 00:12:21,427
Yeah.

256
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:24,929
"C"- sorry, "J."

257
00:12:24,971 --> 00:12:26,930
Ahem. "C"...

258
00:12:26,971 --> 00:12:28,223
- [Whispering] "W."
- "W."

259
00:12:28,306 --> 00:12:30,516
- "Q."
- Uh, "Q."

260
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,267
RAFE: Uh, "'Q."'

261
00:12:34,894 --> 00:12:37,020
Read the bottom line
again, please.

262
00:12:37,104 --> 00:12:41,106
But read it right to left
and every other letter.

263
00:12:47,819 --> 00:12:49,445
"E."

264
00:12:49,487 --> 00:12:52,072
Heh. "'X."'

265
00:12:52,155 --> 00:12:54,449
- [Whispering] X-E.
- X-E.

266
00:12:54,532 --> 00:12:56,909
RAFE: X-E, ma'am.

267
00:12:56,992 --> 00:12:59,578
Ma'am, I know how this looks.

268
00:12:59,661 --> 00:13:01,287
I'm sorry, Lieutenant,
I really am.

269
00:13:01,370 --> 00:13:03,455
But Army and Navy
requires 20/20 vision.

270
00:13:03,539 --> 00:13:06,165
Oh, i-it's-it's not
a problem with my eyes.

271
00:13:06,248 --> 00:13:07,458
I mean, I can see.

272
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,292
I mean, I can hit a running
rabbit with a $3.00 pistol.

273
00:13:09,334 --> 00:13:10,877
I got a problem with letters,
that's all.

274
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,503
Well, maybe after
some schooling...

275
00:13:12,587 --> 00:13:14,170
you could come back
and take the test again.

276
00:13:14,254 --> 00:13:15,463
No, I had schooling.

277
00:13:15,547 --> 00:13:16,839
I mean, I-the teachers
just never knew...

278
00:13:16,922 --> 00:13:18,840
what to make of it.
It's just letters.

279
00:13:18,924 --> 00:13:20,383
I mix 'em up sometimes.
That's all.

280
00:13:20,467 --> 00:13:23,760
I mean, I just get 'em
backward sometimes.

281
00:13:23,844 --> 00:13:27,263
L- look here. Uh, my-my math
and-and spacial reasoning...

282
00:13:27,346 --> 00:13:28,681
and my verbal scores
are all excellent.

283
00:13:28,764 --> 00:13:30,556
But you barely passed
the written exam.

284
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,767
Yeah, but he did pass it.
So, is it my turn now?

285
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:36,144
- No, you'll wait your turn.
- Yes, ma'am.

286
00:13:36,186 --> 00:13:38,395
Ma'am, I-I'm never gonna
be an English teacher.

287
00:13:38,478 --> 00:13:40,939
But I know why I'm here.

288
00:13:41,022 --> 00:13:42,481
To be a pilot.

289
00:13:42,564 --> 00:13:44,191
And you don't dogfight
with manuals.

290
00:13:44,274 --> 00:13:46,233
You don't fly with gauges.

291
00:13:46,317 --> 00:13:47,568
I mean, it's all about
feeling and speed...

292
00:13:47,651 --> 00:13:48,986
and lettin' that plane
become like a part...

293
00:13:49,028 --> 00:13:50,611
of your body.
And that manual...

294
00:13:50,695 --> 00:13:52,947
says that a guy who's a slow
reader can't be a good pilot.

295
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:55,031
That file says I'm
the best pilot in this room.

296
00:13:58,825 --> 00:14:03,996
Ma'am, please,
don't take my wings.

297
00:14:05,706 --> 00:14:07,456
Well, I felt so bad.

298
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:10,250
Evelyn, rotate to station three.

299
00:14:10,334 --> 00:14:11,626
EVELYN: I had no choice.

300
00:14:11,709 --> 00:14:13,669
I passed him.

301
00:14:13,753 --> 00:14:15,046
- Good.
- Uh-huh.

302
00:14:15,129 --> 00:14:18,047
EVELYN: So, then this
cocky pilot comes back.

303
00:14:18,089 --> 00:14:20,340
- Say, fella, are you enlisted?
- Yeah.

304
00:14:20,423 --> 00:14:22,509
"Yeah"? Boy,
you're talking to an officer.

305
00:14:22,592 --> 00:14:23,843
Yes, sir. Sorry, sir.

306
00:14:23,926 --> 00:14:25,177
- Give me that file.
- Yes, sir.

307
00:14:25,219 --> 00:14:27,554
- Parade rest.
- Yes, sir.

308
00:14:27,637 --> 00:14:29,346
Ma'am, I didn't get
a chance to thank you.

309
00:14:29,388 --> 00:14:30,597
Drop your skivvies.

310
00:14:30,723 --> 00:14:33,683
Ah, oh, OK.

311
00:14:33,766 --> 00:14:36,518
Just like this?

312
00:14:36,601 --> 00:14:38,394
That's fine.

313
00:14:38,478 --> 00:14:41,146
EVELYN: He did have
a very cute butt.

314
00:14:41,229 --> 00:14:42,689
You know, I know
you didn't have to pass me...

315
00:14:42,772 --> 00:14:44,023
and you did. And I just-

316
00:14:44,107 --> 00:14:46,858
I didn't think
you'd understand, and you did.

317
00:14:46,942 --> 00:14:49,568
You know, you still
haven't said thank you.

318
00:14:49,652 --> 00:14:50,778
Thank you.

319
00:14:50,861 --> 00:14:52,863
You're welcome.

320
00:14:52,905 --> 00:14:55,906
Why'd you do it?
I mean, I'm just curious.

321
00:14:55,948 --> 00:14:57,699
You're like my hero now.

322
00:14:57,740 --> 00:14:59,534
Actually, my father was a pilot.

323
00:14:59,617 --> 00:15:01,910
And, um, I've seen
first-hand what happens...

324
00:15:01,993 --> 00:15:03,578
when a pilot loses his wings.

325
00:15:03,661 --> 00:15:04,787
You know what?

326
00:15:04,913 --> 00:15:07,164
Your father's my hero,
then, too.

327
00:15:07,247 --> 00:15:10,749
Infact, as an officer,
I think it'd by my duty...

328
00:15:10,874 --> 00:15:13,210
to take my new hero's
daughter out tonight...

329
00:15:13,252 --> 00:15:15,544
Just to-aah!

330
00:15:15,586 --> 00:15:16,921
Gosh, did I poke too deep?

331
00:15:17,004 --> 00:15:19,630
I think you hit the bone there.

332
00:15:19,714 --> 00:15:21,048
[All giggling]

333
00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:22,466
You are so mean.

334
00:15:22,549 --> 00:15:24,676
[Sighs]

335
00:15:24,759 --> 00:15:27,386
What? So is-
is there any chance...

336
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:29,679
that you might,
kind of, sort of...

337
00:15:29,763 --> 00:15:32,347
you know, like me, or...

338
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:36,600
Oh, how did you guess?

339
00:15:36,684 --> 00:15:38,185
[Whispering]
They never taught us...

340
00:15:38,268 --> 00:15:40,728
how to deal with this...
feeling.

341
00:15:43,105 --> 00:15:45,023
Wh-what feeling?

342
00:15:45,106 --> 00:15:48,400
Well, it's kind of like...this.

343
00:15:48,441 --> 00:15:50,068
Ow!

344
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:52,861
Well, he was getting fresh,
so I poked him again.

345
00:15:52,945 --> 00:15:54,196
[All giggling]

346
00:15:54,279 --> 00:15:57,531
All right, Romeo.
I want to get this over with.

347
00:15:57,615 --> 00:15:59,783
Hold on a second.

348
00:15:59,867 --> 00:16:00,908
Miss...

349
00:16:00,992 --> 00:16:03,327
I really, really lick you.

350
00:16:03,411 --> 00:16:05,286
[Gasps]

351
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:06,913
What did he mean?

352
00:16:06,954 --> 00:16:08,663
Like you.

353
00:16:08,747 --> 00:16:09,956
I didn't mean to say that.

354
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:11,249
And I just, um...

355
00:16:11,374 --> 00:16:13,750
I just want to ask you, please,
if I can donate dinner.

356
00:16:13,792 --> 00:16:15,877
EVELYN: He started
to act very strange.

357
00:16:15,961 --> 00:16:18,962
Or, well, buy you dinner.

358
00:16:19,004 --> 00:16:20,589
This isn't your chart.

359
00:16:20,631 --> 00:16:22,715
Whoa.

360
00:16:22,798 --> 00:16:26,801
No. That's the, uh, this,
uh, fellow over here's.

361
00:16:26,884 --> 00:16:28,010
I think he left.

362
00:16:28,094 --> 00:16:29,719
Have you already had this shot?

363
00:16:29,803 --> 00:16:32,639
Yeah, well, once...already.

364
00:16:33,972 --> 00:16:36,433
Well, I wanted-
I mean, can I ask you out?

365
00:16:36,475 --> 00:16:38,517
- No!
- [Groans]

366
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,727
And he just went wham!

367
00:16:41,937 --> 00:16:44,355
Unh! [Groans]

368
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,626
Oh! What'd you do to him?

369
00:16:45,678 --> 00:16:46,773
Oh! What'd you do to him?

370
00:16:46,856 --> 00:16:49,483
- Poor guy.
- [Giggles]

371
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:51,192
[Chattering]

372
00:16:52,443 --> 00:16:53,861
Hey!

373
00:16:53,945 --> 00:16:55,862
Hey!

374
00:16:55,946 --> 00:16:57,322
Oh, my God.
Are you OK?

375
00:16:57,405 --> 00:16:59,531
Uh, yeah.

376
00:16:59,615 --> 00:17:01,074
I'm fine. I feel great.

377
00:17:01,158 --> 00:17:05,578
This is just standard
precautionary...thing.

378
00:17:05,661 --> 00:17:09,080
Look, I got some, uh,
genuine French champagne...

379
00:17:09,163 --> 00:17:10,373
from France.

380
00:17:10,456 --> 00:17:13,124
I thought, you know,
maybe we could celebrate.

381
00:17:13,166 --> 00:17:14,500
Celebrate what?

382
00:17:14,584 --> 00:17:19,337
Oh, I don't know. Uh, well,
you being my hero, for one.

383
00:17:21,547 --> 00:17:24,632
OK. Why not?

384
00:17:26,383 --> 00:17:28,218
So, uh, ahem...

385
00:17:28,301 --> 00:17:29,719
I wanted to thank you.

386
00:17:29,802 --> 00:17:31,554
And I just wanted to, uh...

387
00:17:31,637 --> 00:17:34,138
put your mind at ease
about passing me...

388
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:37,307
because I really do think
you did this country a service.

389
00:17:37,349 --> 00:17:40,768
I mean, I'm-
I am a great flier.

390
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:43,812
And if you have a fault,
which you obviously don't...

391
00:17:43,854 --> 00:17:46,480
it's modesty.

392
00:17:46,522 --> 00:17:50,441
No. If I have a fault,
it's candor.

393
00:17:51,901 --> 00:17:53,902
You are just so-

394
00:17:54,027 --> 00:17:55,987
[Gasps]

395
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:59,072
Uhh. Cork just got away from me.

396
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:06,327
[Groans]

397
00:18:06,368 --> 00:18:07,911
[Chuckles]

398
00:18:07,995 --> 00:18:09,496
God, oh, it hurts.

399
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:13,249
It hurts something fierce.

400
00:18:13,332 --> 00:18:14,499
I'm sorry.

401
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:16,084
- Ohh...
- Oh, it's bleeding.

402
00:18:16,167 --> 00:18:18,252
- God.
- Oh!

403
00:18:18,336 --> 00:18:20,336
- Ohh!
- Lay still.

404
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:21,546
I ruined everything.

405
00:18:21,629 --> 00:18:22,963
- Lay still.
- Oh, it hurts.

406
00:18:23,046 --> 00:18:25,131
- Ow! It's cold.
- It'll stop the bleeding.

407
00:18:25,215 --> 00:18:26,800
Yeah. I can't breathe.

408
00:18:26,883 --> 00:18:29,426
- Lay still.
- [Sighs]

409
00:18:33,387 --> 00:18:35,680
You are so beautiful it hurts.

410
00:18:35,763 --> 00:18:38,849
It's your nose that hurts.

411
00:18:38,933 --> 00:18:42,310
No. I think it's my heart.

412
00:18:49,856 --> 00:18:52,775
EVELYN: And then I kissed him.

413
00:18:52,858 --> 00:18:55,319
MARTHA: Oh, Evelyn.

414
00:18:55,402 --> 00:18:58,029
That's the most romantic story
I ever heard.

415
00:18:58,112 --> 00:19:03,658
It's been the most romantic four
weeks and two days of my life.

416
00:19:03,741 --> 00:19:05,534
Oh, I'm so jealous.

417
00:19:21,461 --> 00:19:23,546
[Giggling]

418
00:19:24,922 --> 00:19:26,256
Hello, Lieutenant.

419
00:19:26,339 --> 00:19:28,633
- It's good to see you.
- You, too, Lieutenant.

420
00:19:28,716 --> 00:19:30,884
Pick a hand.

421
00:19:34,845 --> 00:19:36,597
It's beautiful.

422
00:19:38,514 --> 00:19:40,433
What's in your other hand?

423
00:19:40,516 --> 00:19:41,976
Mine.

424
00:19:43,976 --> 00:19:46,936
Well, it took me six hours
to fold these.

425
00:19:48,605 --> 00:19:49,731
Oh!

426
00:19:49,814 --> 00:19:52,232
[Laughs]

427
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:54,317
I want you to meet my friends.

428
00:19:54,401 --> 00:19:57,569
Rafe, this is Martha,
Barbara, Sandra-

429
00:19:57,653 --> 00:20:00,404
- Hi. I'm Betty.
- Hi.

430
00:20:00,488 --> 00:20:02,740
Would you happen
to have any friends?

431
00:20:02,781 --> 00:20:06,158
Huh. Take your pick.

432
00:20:06,284 --> 00:20:07,826
Hi.

433
00:20:07,951 --> 00:20:10,036
[Swing music playing]

434
00:20:10,119 --> 00:20:13,288
[Laughing and talking]

435
00:20:13,371 --> 00:20:14,664
Whoo!

436
00:20:32,343 --> 00:20:34,594
We ever get in this war
and somethin' happens to me...

437
00:20:34,678 --> 00:20:38,639
I can't tell you how good
it makes me feel to know...

438
00:20:38,722 --> 00:20:41,140
that someone as sweet
as you will be there...

439
00:20:41,223 --> 00:20:42,891
to nurse me back to health.

440
00:20:42,975 --> 00:20:45,309
Good, but we're not
in the war yet.

441
00:20:45,393 --> 00:20:47,895
- Ahem.
- OK. That was a bad line.

442
00:20:47,978 --> 00:20:50,271
- Hi.
- [Laughing]

443
00:20:50,355 --> 00:20:52,940
I'm-I'm Red.

444
00:20:52,982 --> 00:20:58,568
Red-[Snorting]
S- s-s-s-strange.

445
00:20:58,652 --> 00:21:00,445
Heh heh.
Your last name's Strange?

446
00:21:00,529 --> 00:21:01,905
Yeah. She's all yours, soldier.

447
00:21:01,987 --> 00:21:04,364
No. It-it's Winkle.

448
00:21:04,448 --> 00:21:06,115
[Laughs]

449
00:21:06,157 --> 00:21:07,867
Red is such a ladies' man.

450
00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:09,076
Do you always stutter?

451
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:12,870
No. Only when I'm-
[Snorting]

452
00:21:12,995 --> 00:21:14,121
She's totally buying it.

453
00:21:14,247 --> 00:21:16,122
- Nervous?
- Yeah.

454
00:21:16,164 --> 00:21:17,832
Why can't I get
something like that?

455
00:21:26,171 --> 00:21:27,338
Hello.

456
00:21:27,421 --> 00:21:28,964
Hi.

457
00:21:29,006 --> 00:21:31,591
Danny seems kind of shy
around the girls.

458
00:21:31,674 --> 00:21:35,094
Tsk. It's not that he's shy.

459
00:21:35,177 --> 00:21:36,428
He's just, ahem...

460
00:21:36,511 --> 00:21:38,930
a little unsure of himself,
you know.

461
00:21:39,013 --> 00:21:40,889
His old man used to
run him down a lot.

462
00:21:40,972 --> 00:21:44,641
Get him in a plane,
he's sure of himself.

463
00:21:44,725 --> 00:21:46,935
He's like my brother.
He's like my best friend.

464
00:21:47,019 --> 00:21:49,645
He's my right hand.

465
00:21:49,728 --> 00:21:54,148
Which at the moment is
a long way south of my waist.

466
00:21:54,190 --> 00:21:55,816
Oh, I'm sorry.

467
00:21:55,858 --> 00:21:58,484
I guess I lost
a little altitude.

468
00:21:58,526 --> 00:22:00,528
Yeah, I guess you did.

469
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:02,070
Excuse me.

470
00:22:16,664 --> 00:22:19,040
You and me, we got to talk.

471
00:22:19,123 --> 00:22:22,709
So, the rumor is the Navy's
shipping us to Pearl Harbor.

472
00:22:22,834 --> 00:22:24,753
Well, won't be so bad.

473
00:22:24,836 --> 00:22:27,421
It's about as far from
the fighting as you can get.

474
00:22:27,504 --> 00:22:29,339
You'll get a sun tan.

475
00:22:29,381 --> 00:22:33,008
So maybe the Army'll
post you guys there, too.

476
00:22:33,091 --> 00:22:37,136
You...are a super special woman.

477
00:22:37,219 --> 00:22:38,595
And, and, well...

478
00:22:38,678 --> 00:22:40,096
[Sniffs]

479
00:22:40,179 --> 00:22:42,056
Well, they're-
they're training me...

480
00:22:42,139 --> 00:22:47,267
to be a big bad warrior,
and, well...

481
00:22:49,728 --> 00:22:51,812
So, I mean, you never know
what might happen tomorrow...

482
00:22:51,895 --> 00:22:57,399
or...or any day
after that, you know?

483
00:22:57,525 --> 00:22:59,984
So...

484
00:23:00,109 --> 00:23:03,154
God, we need to make
tonight super special.

485
00:23:03,237 --> 00:23:05,822
Why are you crying?

486
00:23:05,905 --> 00:23:07,532
I guess it's the thought...

487
00:23:07,573 --> 00:23:10,033
that I might not ever
get to see you again.

488
00:23:10,075 --> 00:23:11,825
Dry your eyes, toots.

489
00:23:11,909 --> 00:23:13,035
Tonight, you're mine.

490
00:23:13,118 --> 00:23:15,245
I don't want to be
with a crowd tonight.

491
00:23:15,329 --> 00:23:17,872
I just want to be
alone with you.

492
00:23:17,913 --> 00:23:19,873
Well...

493
00:23:19,915 --> 00:23:22,792
How does New York Harbor
by moonlight sound?

494
00:23:22,959 --> 00:23:25,043
Ohh! Heh heh!

495
00:23:25,126 --> 00:23:27,587
EVELYN: Are you gonna be
a bad influence?

496
00:23:27,628 --> 00:23:30,088
Of course I'm a bad influence.

497
00:23:30,171 --> 00:23:32,090
Let's see if we can
commandeer this vessel...

498
00:23:32,132 --> 00:23:34,383
'cause we're, uh, officers
of the U.S. Government.

499
00:23:34,466 --> 00:23:36,176
Not for long, we won't be.

500
00:23:47,225 --> 00:23:49,559
One day, we'll take a trip
on a boat like that.

501
00:23:49,601 --> 00:23:50,977
Would you like that?

502
00:23:51,061 --> 00:23:55,230
We'll be dressing for cocktails
and walk into the grandsalon.

503
00:23:55,272 --> 00:23:56,898
No one's talking about war.

504
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:59,233
They're just dancing
to Cole Porter.

505
00:23:59,316 --> 00:24:01,902
- I'll have to get a tux.
- Yeah.

506
00:24:06,279 --> 00:24:09,031
Come on. There you go.
All aboard.

507
00:24:09,115 --> 00:24:11,157
- You're out of your mind.
- Oh, yeah.

508
00:24:11,241 --> 00:24:12,534
Careful now.
Here, sit down.

509
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:15,744
Now let's see here.

510
00:24:18,079 --> 00:24:21,457
Ah! There we go.

511
00:24:23,082 --> 00:24:26,168
See, this is as close as I
could get you to your ship.

512
00:24:26,252 --> 00:24:28,378
So, at least I tried, right?

513
00:24:29,962 --> 00:24:32,297
Actually, you know what?
This is better.

514
00:24:32,422 --> 00:24:34,215
Yeah, it is.

515
00:24:34,299 --> 00:24:36,758
God, you're pretty.

516
00:24:55,438 --> 00:24:58,732
What's gonna become
of us all, Rafe?

517
00:25:00,442 --> 00:25:05,236
Well, the future's not
exactly in our hands, is it?

518
00:25:05,319 --> 00:25:07,946
No. I guess you're right.

519
00:25:15,410 --> 00:25:16,828
[Both screaming]

520
00:25:18,203 --> 00:25:19,663
- Aah!
- Aah!

521
00:25:19,704 --> 00:25:22,289
Oh, my God!
Are you all right?

522
00:25:22,372 --> 00:25:23,624
Yeah, are you?

523
00:25:23,665 --> 00:25:25,292
That was not part of the date.

524
00:25:30,711 --> 00:25:32,463
[Evelyn giggles]

525
00:25:32,505 --> 00:25:33,631
RAFE: Watch your step.

526
00:25:33,714 --> 00:25:36,299
[Laughs] Oh, thank you.

527
00:25:36,382 --> 00:25:37,633
BARBARA: Evelyn!

528
00:25:37,758 --> 00:25:40,385
Guys, come up! Come on up!

529
00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:43,345
Come up! We're in 321.

530
00:25:43,387 --> 00:25:45,347
There's something
I got to tell you.

531
00:25:45,388 --> 00:25:47,556
Well, you got no secrets
from me, Lieutenant.

532
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:49,183
I've seen your medical chart.

533
00:25:49,266 --> 00:25:50,684
Here we go.

534
00:25:50,726 --> 00:25:52,643
[Sighs]

535
00:25:56,687 --> 00:25:59,981
This can't be good, or it
wouldn't be so hard to say.

536
00:26:00,023 --> 00:26:01,608
[Sighs] Yep.

537
00:26:01,691 --> 00:26:04,109
I got to go away.

538
00:26:04,192 --> 00:26:06,611
We're all going away.

539
00:26:06,695 --> 00:26:08,445
Yeah...

540
00:26:08,529 --> 00:26:12,156
but I'm going to the war...
tomorrow.

541
00:26:13,365 --> 00:26:15,159
I'm flying with
the Eagle Squadron.

542
00:26:15,242 --> 00:26:19,495
It's an outfit the British
started for American pilots.

543
00:26:19,537 --> 00:26:23,623
I don't understand.

544
00:26:23,706 --> 00:26:26,625
You're in the U.S. Army.
How could they order you to go?

545
00:26:26,708 --> 00:26:29,126
They didn't order me.

546
00:26:29,209 --> 00:26:31,295
I volunteered.

547
00:26:33,754 --> 00:26:36,215
Huh.

548
00:26:36,256 --> 00:26:38,466
But I passed you.

549
00:26:38,549 --> 00:26:41,218
I let you through.

550
00:26:41,301 --> 00:26:42,969
And now you volunteer...

551
00:26:43,052 --> 00:26:45,138
for the most dangerous place
you could go?

552
00:26:45,221 --> 00:26:49,182
It's not your responsibility,
not your choice.

553
00:26:49,224 --> 00:26:52,100
Flying's the only thing
I ever wanted to do.

554
00:26:52,184 --> 00:26:56,478
I mean, everything in my life
has led me up to this point.

555
00:26:59,230 --> 00:27:00,856
Meeting you.

556
00:27:04,525 --> 00:27:05,693
I love you.

557
00:27:05,776 --> 00:27:07,944
[Sighs]

558
00:27:08,028 --> 00:27:10,155
I love you so much.

559
00:27:13,073 --> 00:27:14,990
RAFE: Let's go inside.

560
00:27:22,663 --> 00:27:24,956
All right. Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

561
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:26,666
Just-I-I can't do this.

562
00:27:26,749 --> 00:27:30,418
This just-it's not right.
I'm sorry. I just-

563
00:27:30,501 --> 00:27:31,960
See, I can't do this.

564
00:27:32,044 --> 00:27:35,088
I mean, I mean, I can.
I- I want to.

565
00:27:35,171 --> 00:27:38,006
I'm not trying to be noble,
you know.

566
00:27:38,090 --> 00:27:40,257
Or not saying
I know what would happen...

567
00:27:40,341 --> 00:27:42,384
or just-
I need to stop talking.

568
00:27:42,468 --> 00:27:44,260
I just-I just don't want-

569
00:27:44,344 --> 00:27:46,053
I just don't want it
to be like everybody else.

570
00:27:46,137 --> 00:27:48,097
I don't want you to have
anything about tonight...

571
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:49,973
that you regret.

572
00:27:50,056 --> 00:27:53,391
I mean, it's been the most
incredible night of my life...

573
00:27:53,475 --> 00:27:55,810
and I don't want to ruin that.

574
00:27:55,894 --> 00:27:57,853
Oh, you couldn't ruin it.

575
00:27:59,396 --> 00:28:05,191
If I had one more night to live,
I'd want to spend it with you.

576
00:28:05,274 --> 00:28:06,567
[Sighs]

577
00:28:06,651 --> 00:28:08,944
See, that's what I want
to come home to.

578
00:28:09,028 --> 00:28:12,405
That's what I want to have
to think about and dream about.

579
00:28:12,447 --> 00:28:15,073
I want to know that
the best part of my life...

580
00:28:15,115 --> 00:28:16,991
is still ahead of me.

581
00:28:18,116 --> 00:28:19,743
Look.

582
00:28:19,785 --> 00:28:25,581
Don't, um...could you...
not come see me off?

583
00:28:25,664 --> 00:28:29,166
Because, uh...saying good-bye
to you once is hard enough.

584
00:28:32,335 --> 00:28:34,628
[Whispering] Here.

585
00:28:37,130 --> 00:28:38,423
Take this.

586
00:28:38,464 --> 00:28:41,091
Why?
You think it looks good on me?

587
00:28:41,133 --> 00:28:42,925
[Sighs]

588
00:28:42,967 --> 00:28:45,427
[Sighs]

589
00:28:45,469 --> 00:28:47,595
I will come back.

590
00:29:24,037 --> 00:29:26,371
I thought you said
you told her not to come.

591
00:29:26,455 --> 00:29:27,706
Yeah, I did.

592
00:29:27,789 --> 00:29:29,457
Why you looking for her then?

593
00:29:29,498 --> 00:29:32,209
It's my test.

594
00:29:32,334 --> 00:29:34,377
If I tell her not to come,
and she comes anyway...

595
00:29:34,502 --> 00:29:36,796
then I-I know she loves me.

596
00:29:36,879 --> 00:29:39,088
All aboard! Track 57!

597
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:46,718
If, uh, anything
happens to me...

598
00:29:46,802 --> 00:29:49,137
I want you to be the one
to tell her.

599
00:29:49,221 --> 00:29:50,721
All right?

600
00:29:50,804 --> 00:29:54,474
You just make sure and come back
for the both of us, all right?

601
00:29:54,557 --> 00:29:57,018
OK.

602
00:30:08,025 --> 00:30:09,693
RAFE: See you when I get back.

603
00:30:09,818 --> 00:30:11,110
Yeah.

604
00:30:14,363 --> 00:30:16,572
Good hunting, Rafe.

00:30:41,381 --> 00:30:42,507
Evelyn!

608
00:30:43,382 --> 00:30:44,507

Evelyn.

612
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:53,972
Hey!

613
00:31:00,769 --> 00:31:02,520
She loves me.

NEWSREEL NARRATOR:
The German Luftwaffe...

617
00:31:07,273 --> 00:31:10,358
relentlessly bombards
downtown London...

618
00:31:10,484 --> 00:31:12,402
while Churchill's
Royal Air Force...

619
00:31:12,485 --> 00:31:13,902
is in a deadly struggle...

620
00:31:13,986 --> 00:31:17,072
to maintain control
of the British skies.

621
00:31:38,878 --> 00:31:40,462
This is a real mess.

622
00:31:40,546 --> 00:31:44,173
Lieutenant McCawley
reporting for duty, sir.

623
00:31:46,550 --> 00:31:47,634
Good.

624
00:31:47,759 --> 00:31:50,511
We'll get you settled
into your quarters.

625
00:31:50,595 --> 00:31:53,847
And then introduce you
to the crate you'll be flying.

626
00:31:53,930 --> 00:31:57,349
If y'all are patching up
bullet holes here...

627
00:31:57,432 --> 00:31:58,642
maybe we ought
to skip housekeeping...

628
00:31:58,725 --> 00:32:00,059
and get me in an airplane.

629
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:01,393
MAN: Two didn't come back, sir.

630
00:32:01,435 --> 00:32:03,228
We counted only eleven.

631
00:32:09,982 --> 00:32:11,984
Are all Yanks
as anxious as you...

632
00:32:12,068 --> 00:32:14,068
to get themselves killed,
Pilot Officer?

633
00:32:14,152 --> 00:32:17,362
Not anxious to die, sir.
Just anxious to matter.

634
00:32:23,283 --> 00:32:24,992
This is yours.

635
00:32:26,744 --> 00:32:28,203
Good chap.

636
00:32:28,287 --> 00:32:31,372
Didn't die till he'd landed
and shut down his engine.

637
00:32:45,674 --> 00:32:47,258
Please be seated, gentlemen.

638
00:32:50,551 --> 00:32:52,928
I'm afraid I'm in a bad mood.

639
00:32:53,012 --> 00:32:58,266
Churchill and Stalin are
asking me what I'm asking you.

640
00:32:58,349 --> 00:33:01,351
How long is America
going to pretend...

641
00:33:01,476 --> 00:33:03,185
the world is not at war?

642
00:33:03,268 --> 00:33:06,021
We've increased food and oil
shipments, Mr. President...

643
00:33:06,104 --> 00:33:07,396
and as far as I know-

644
00:33:07,479 --> 00:33:10,065
What they really need
are tanks, planes...

645
00:33:10,149 --> 00:33:11,857
bullets, bombs,
and men to fight.

646
00:33:11,941 --> 00:33:16,110
But our people think
Hitler and his Nazit hugs...

647
00:33:16,194 --> 00:33:18,237
are Europe's problem.

648
00:33:18,321 --> 00:33:21,781
We have to do more.

649
00:33:21,865 --> 00:33:24,324
Send the Brits and Russians
more of our ships...

650
00:33:24,449 --> 00:33:25,909
and anti-aircraft weapons.

651
00:33:25,992 --> 00:33:27,910
And keep cannibalizing
the Pacific Fleet?

652
00:33:27,993 --> 00:33:29,495
What choice do we have?

653
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:34,331
We're building refrigerators
while our enemies build bombs.

654
00:34:43,127 --> 00:34:44,671
This is so exciting.

655
00:34:44,754 --> 00:34:47,215
You know there's about
one hundred ships on Pearl.

656
00:34:47,256 --> 00:34:48,715
BETTY:
How many sailors per ship?

657
00:34:48,757 --> 00:34:51,134
It depends.
More on a battleship than a sub.

658
00:34:51,217 --> 00:34:53,677
But say, on average...2,000?

659
00:34:53,719 --> 00:34:56,971
Then there's the flyers,
the marines, base personnel.

660
00:34:57,054 --> 00:34:58,347
I'm still working on
the sailors.

661
00:34:58,388 --> 00:35:00,890
Girls, I think the odds
are in your favor.

662
00:35:00,931 --> 00:35:02,766
Yeah, like 4,000 to one.

663
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:05,351
- It's paradise.

EARL: Hey!

668
00:35:17,776 --> 00:35:20,279
You're not supposed
to paint titties...

669
00:35:20,362 --> 00:35:21,696
on the side of my airplanes.

670
00:35:21,779 --> 00:35:24,365
And if you do,
don't make 'em lopsided.

671
00:35:24,406 --> 00:35:25,531
They were lopsided, Earl.

672
00:35:25,615 --> 00:35:26,866

Look, it says right here.

673
00:35:26,949 --> 00:35:31,202
"Never ride waves amongst
rocks or submerged pilings."

674
00:35:31,286 --> 00:35:33,037
See, it says
you shouldn't do that.

675
00:35:33,079 --> 00:35:36,081
How do you know they're
submerged if they're submerged?

are you doing?

on my new invention-

00:35:48,256 --> 00:35:49,715
I'm gonna be a rich fella.

682
00:35:49,757 --> 00:35:51,883
Every surfboard in
the nation's gonna need one.

683
00:35:51,966 --> 00:35:53,634

you're gonna need a broom.

00:36:44,169 --> 00:36:47,129
There is one place
I can go to find warmth.

704
00:36:47,212 --> 00:36:49,505
That is to think of you.

705
00:36:49,588 --> 00:36:52,049
I just wish I could be
back there with you.

706
00:36:55,301 --> 00:36:57,719
RAFE:
It's not easy making friends.

707
00:36:57,802 --> 00:36:59,095
Two days ago, I had a beer...

708
00:36:59,137 --> 00:37:01,139
with a couple
of the RAF pilots.

709
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:03,348
Yesterday,
both of them got killed.

710
00:37:16,274 --> 00:37:18,233
EVELYN: Dear Rafe.

711
00:37:18,358 --> 00:37:20,902
I miss you so much.

712
00:37:20,985 --> 00:37:24,821
It's so strange to be
half a world away from you.

713
00:37:26,197 --> 00:37:27,656
RAFE:
I'm right on his tail!

714
00:37:33,702 --> 00:37:36,412
Got one!

715
00:37:36,495 --> 00:37:39,455
EVELYN: Every night
I look at the sunset...

716
00:37:39,539 --> 00:37:42,917
and try to draw the last ounce
of heat from its long day...

717
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,544
and send it
from my heart to yours.

718
00:37:52,506 --> 00:37:53,632
Family?

719
00:37:53,716 --> 00:37:56,842
Girl, sir.

720
00:37:56,968 --> 00:37:59,428
The girl.

721
00:38:01,095 --> 00:38:03,306
A lot of people
frown on the Yanks...

722
00:38:03,389 --> 00:38:05,015
for not being in this war yet.

723
00:38:05,098 --> 00:38:06,933
I'd just like to say...

724
00:38:07,016 --> 00:38:09,935
if there are many more
back home like you...

725
00:38:10,018 --> 00:38:13,354
God help anyone who goes
to war with America.

726
00:38:17,565 --> 00:38:18,899
[Bell chimes]

727
00:38:18,983 --> 00:38:20,859
OFFICER: Atten-hut!

728
00:38:20,943 --> 00:38:23,444
Attention on deck!
Admiral Kimmel...

729
00:38:23,528 --> 00:38:25,820
Commander-in-Chief,
Pacific Fleet, on deck.

730
00:38:25,904 --> 00:38:27,071
KIMMEL:
Sharp presentation, Captain.

731
00:38:27,197 --> 00:38:28,865
Thank you, Admiral Kimmel.

732
00:38:28,990 --> 00:38:31,783
For four months now Washington's
been blowing pink smoke...

733
00:38:31,867 --> 00:38:33,410
about the threat from Japan.

734
00:38:33,535 --> 00:38:34,993
Could make us lose
our fighting edge.

735
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:36,745
I'm determined
not to let that happen.

736
00:38:37,870 --> 00:38:39,830
[Ship's horn blows]

737
00:38:43,541 --> 00:38:44,709
With your permission, Captain.

738
00:38:44,792 --> 00:38:47,794
Admiral, urgent,
from Washington.

739
00:38:51,922 --> 00:38:53,673
I'm supposed
to keep this fleet...

740
00:38:53,715 --> 00:38:55,507
battle-ready
to take on the Japanese...

741
00:38:55,549 --> 00:38:57,801
cover half the damn globe.

742
00:38:57,884 --> 00:38:59,385
Now they want me to transfer...

743
00:38:59,468 --> 00:39:00,886
another twelve destroyers
to the Atlantic.

744
00:39:00,970 --> 00:39:02,471
Don't they know what
we're facing out here?

745
00:39:02,554 --> 00:39:04,513
They feel Europe
is the greater danger.

746
00:39:04,555 --> 00:39:07,557
I'm assuming these risk
assessments include Hawaii?

747
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:10,685
Pearl Harbor is too shallow
for an aerial torpedo attack.

748
00:39:10,768 --> 00:39:12,143
We're surrounded by sub nets.

749
00:39:12,227 --> 00:39:14,354
All we need worry
about is sabotage...

750
00:39:14,437 --> 00:39:16,021
so we bunched
our planes together...

751
00:39:16,104 --> 00:39:17,773
to make them easier to protect.

752
00:39:17,856 --> 00:39:19,940
Distance is our ally, Admiral.

753
00:39:20,024 --> 00:39:24,026
You analysts got it
all figured out, don't you?

754
00:39:24,110 --> 00:39:26,404
The smart enemy hits you...

755
00:39:26,487 --> 00:39:28,196
exactly where
you think you're safe.

756
00:40:38,619 --> 00:40:40,954
- [Air raid siren]
- Incoming!

757
00:40:41,079 --> 00:40:43,039
[Shouting]

758
00:40:51,503 --> 00:40:53,838
I fixed the hydraulics
and electrics, sir...

759
00:40:53,921 --> 00:40:55,840
but the oil hoses
still need attention.

760
00:40:55,923 --> 00:40:57,048
Just crank it, lan!

761
00:40:57,131 --> 00:40:58,424
God speed you, sir.

762
00:41:07,806 --> 00:41:09,098
Red section, take the bombers.

763
00:41:09,139 --> 00:41:11,642
Blue section,
look out for the fighters.

764
00:41:11,725 --> 00:41:13,434
Bombers dead ahead.

765
00:41:13,517 --> 00:41:15,686
Let's drop in
and give 'em a reception.

766
00:41:18,730 --> 00:41:21,107
Red Two, follow my lead,
high side.

767
00:41:21,147 --> 00:41:22,482
Go right at the lead bomber.

768
00:41:22,565 --> 00:41:23,691
Following you, Red One.

769
00:41:27,777 --> 00:41:29,737
[Gunfire]

770
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:32,948
Good hit! Good hit!

771
00:41:37,909 --> 00:41:39,911
Red One, coming around,
reset for the kill.

772
00:41:42,495 --> 00:41:43,663
I have the middle bomber.

773
00:41:47,999 --> 00:41:49,125
Hammer down!

774
00:41:54,171 --> 00:41:56,755
We got him.
Nice shot, Red Two.

775
00:41:56,839 --> 00:41:59,298
I got two M.E.s dead ahead.

776
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:06,554
RAFE: I'm on him.
I'm on his tail.

777
00:42:06,637 --> 00:42:08,138
Hammer down.

778
00:42:10,390 --> 00:42:12,182
RAFE: I got one of them!

779
00:42:23,858 --> 00:42:25,108
I got another one.

780
00:42:25,191 --> 00:42:27,652
Red One, you got fighters
all over your tail!

781
00:42:28,860 --> 00:42:30,403
I'm under fire!
I'm taking fire!

782
00:42:33,530 --> 00:42:36,615
Red One, get out of there.
Pull up! Pull up!

783
00:42:41,869 --> 00:42:44,330
Argh! I got an oil leak.

784
00:42:45,371 --> 00:42:46,664
[Screams]

785
00:42:48,249 --> 00:42:50,041
Can't see a damn thing!

786
00:42:52,460 --> 00:42:54,961
I can't bail!
My canopy's stuck!

787
00:42:55,087 --> 00:42:56,671
I can't bail out!

788
00:43:06,344 --> 00:43:07,845
He's on my tail, Red Two.

789
00:43:11,723 --> 00:43:13,725
I'm hit! I'm hit!

790
00:43:21,730 --> 00:43:23,731
Mayday! Mayday!

791
00:43:28,442 --> 00:43:30,528
Oh, my God.

792
00:43:44,411 --> 00:43:45,746
BETTY:
I'm no good at church.

793
00:43:45,829 --> 00:43:47,039
SANDRA:
What do you mean, sweetie?

794
00:43:47,081 --> 00:43:50,499
When I'm up there getting
my slate wiped clean...

795
00:43:50,583 --> 00:43:53,418
I'm thinking how
to dirty it up again.

796
00:43:53,501 --> 00:43:54,627
Wow, this from a virgin!

797
00:43:54,711 --> 00:43:56,545
I got to inventory supplies.

798
00:43:56,628 --> 00:43:58,505
Kill me now.

799
00:43:58,588 --> 00:44:00,422
Could you be any more boring?

800
00:44:00,547 --> 00:44:02,841
Don't bother.
Sunday, she writes Rafe...

801
00:44:02,924 --> 00:44:05,342
ten pages instead
of the usual five.

802
00:44:05,426 --> 00:44:06,552
[Sighs]

803
00:44:06,635 --> 00:44:08,428
Gosh, I wish I was in love.

804
00:44:08,512 --> 00:44:09,679
[Honks]

805
00:44:10,888 --> 00:44:12,640
Hey, sweetheart.

806
00:44:13,973 --> 00:44:15,183
She hates me.

807
00:44:16,434 --> 00:44:17,642
Good to see you, Red.

808
00:44:17,726 --> 00:44:20,186
Good to see you, too, Betty.

809
00:44:20,270 --> 00:44:21,770
You wanna come for a ride?

810
00:44:21,812 --> 00:44:23,271
Come on.

811
00:44:23,313 --> 00:44:25,564
Yeah, I'll be your chauffeur.

812
00:44:25,731 --> 00:44:27,608
[Cheering]

813
00:44:37,448 --> 00:44:38,782
That-a-boy! Be a mad dog!

814
00:44:38,865 --> 00:44:42,284
You hit pretty hard...
for a cook.

815
00:44:44,411 --> 00:44:46,578
All right, Walker,
who you got?

816
00:44:46,662 --> 00:44:48,372
I'll take the cook.

817
00:44:48,455 --> 00:44:49,665
Why? You don't like money?

818
00:44:52,625 --> 00:44:54,376
Come on! Get out there now!

819
00:44:57,795 --> 00:45:00,255
- I'll put five on it.
- Done.

820
00:45:01,673 --> 00:45:03,049
Against a mechanic?

821
00:45:03,132 --> 00:45:04,966
That guy craps rivets.

822
00:45:05,091 --> 00:45:06,301
How's it feel up
from the engine room?

823
00:45:06,426 --> 00:45:07,676
Sunlight botherin' you?

824
00:45:08,969 --> 00:45:10,095
Ow.

825
00:45:11,637 --> 00:45:13,180
Man, he's getting all busted up!

826
00:45:14,515 --> 00:45:15,890
Move! Move!

00:45:15,973 --> 00:45:17,350
[Bell rings]

828
00:45:17,433 --> 00:45:18,934
Come here, we gotta talk.

829
00:45:19,018 --> 00:45:20,393
Get down here.

830
00:45:20,477 --> 00:45:21,686
He can't hurt us.

831
00:45:21,769 --> 00:45:23,813
He can hurt us.

832
00:45:23,896 --> 00:45:26,231
- He cut us. We bleeding.
- Bleeding?

833
00:45:26,314 --> 00:45:29,107
That's a scratch. See this?

834
00:45:29,149 --> 00:45:30,567
This is the hard-earned
greenbacks...

835
00:45:30,651 --> 00:45:33,110
of every pot-scrubbin'
chop in this fleet.

836
00:45:33,194 --> 00:45:34,653
Now if we don'twin...

837
00:45:34,737 --> 00:45:36,988
Teeny here has to find
another battleship!

838
00:45:37,071 --> 00:45:39,281
I'm not going back
to the Arizona empty-handed.

839
00:45:39,407 --> 00:45:42,033
Don't worry about the money.

840
00:45:42,158 --> 00:45:45,452
I'll send that
smug engine-fixin' snipe...

841
00:45:45,493 --> 00:45:46,995
back below decks where he belong.

842
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:48,246
[Bell rings]

843
00:45:48,329 --> 00:45:49,955
We the man!

844

He slapped your mama!
Be a son of a bitch!

845
00:46:01,213 --> 00:46:02,547
Look at this!
All right, Dorie!

846
00:46:15,723 --> 00:46:18,100
REFEREE:
That's enough. That's enough.

847
00:46:20,684 --> 00:46:21,810
[Cheering]

848
00:46:21,852 --> 00:46:25,438
- Oh! Where's my money?
- Nah, fight's rigged.

849
00:46:25,521 --> 00:46:27,981
We're rich! Ha ha ha!

850
00:46:30,650 --> 00:46:31,817
EVELYN: How'd you get this?

851
00:46:31,858 --> 00:46:33,985
Boxing.

852
00:46:34,027 --> 00:46:35,569
Did you win?

853
00:46:35,652 --> 00:46:37,487
Yes, ma'am.

854
00:46:37,571 --> 00:46:41,407
What do you get for winning?

855
00:46:41,490 --> 00:46:43,075
Respect.

856
00:46:47,870 --> 00:46:52,330
So, why do you have to fight
with your fists to get respect?

857
00:46:52,456 --> 00:46:54,666
I left my momma in Texas...

858
00:46:54,708 --> 00:46:56,792
and joined the Navy
to see the world...

859
00:46:56,875 --> 00:46:58,960
become a man.

860
00:46:59,044 --> 00:47:01,795
They made me a cook.

861
00:47:01,879 --> 00:47:03,088
Not even that.

862
00:47:03,172 --> 00:47:06,257
I clean up after
other sailors eat.

863
00:47:06,340 --> 00:47:11,636
Two years, they never even
let me fire a weapon.

864
00:47:11,719 --> 00:47:14,429
Well, let's hope
you never have to.

865
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:16,931
Yes, ma'am.

866
00:47:17,015 --> 00:47:18,849
You take care,
Petty Officer Miller.

867
00:47:18,932 --> 00:47:20,517
You, too, ma'am.

868
00:48:03,629 --> 00:48:06,923
DANNY: You know,
he taught me to fly.

869
00:48:07,007 --> 00:48:09,717
I always knew that no matter
what trouble I got into...

870
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:12,343
I'd never be in it alone.

871
00:48:12,427 --> 00:48:16,846
He'd be there with me.

872
00:48:16,930 --> 00:48:20,474
He was always pushing me
to be better and faster.

873
00:48:22,642 --> 00:48:25,477
He told me
you were a great flier.

874
00:48:26,603 --> 00:48:28,396
It was the same night
he told me...

875
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:30,481
he'd volunteered
to go to England.

876
00:48:32,566 --> 00:48:35,443
Volunteered?

877
00:48:35,526 --> 00:48:40,071
He...he told me
he'd been assigned.

878
00:48:44,032 --> 00:48:47,242
He was always
trying to protect me.

879
00:48:50,744 --> 00:48:52,246
But you know what?

880
00:48:52,329 --> 00:48:55,081
I look at myself in
the mirror in this uniform...

881
00:48:55,122 --> 00:48:58,499
and I still
don't know who I am.

882
00:48:58,625 --> 00:49:01,878
I look like a hero...

883
00:49:01,961 --> 00:49:04,587
but I don't feel like it.

884
00:49:06,463 --> 00:49:09,716
Rafe...

885
00:49:09,799 --> 00:49:13,427
he always looked the part,
didn't he?

886
00:49:13,510 --> 00:49:15,720
He couldn't wait to be one.

887
00:49:38,736 --> 00:49:41,696
To Rafe McCawley.

888
00:49:41,821 --> 00:49:45,281
The best pilot...

889
00:49:45,365 --> 00:49:49,117
and the best friend
I ever knew...

890
00:49:49,159 --> 00:49:50,744
or ever will know.

891
00:49:54,997 --> 00:49:56,622
To Rafe.

892
00:50:08,256 --> 00:50:10,215
[Shouting]

893
00:51:01,250 --> 00:51:03,001
[Machines clacking]

894
00:51:03,043 --> 00:51:04,502
THURMAN: Look at this.
The Japanese...

895
00:51:04,543 --> 00:51:06,629
are flooding the Pacific
with radio traffic.

896
00:51:06,712 --> 00:51:10,089
Everywhere from the Panama Canal
to southeast Asia.

897
00:51:10,172 --> 00:51:11,632
There's no logical pattern,
Captain.

898
00:51:11,757 --> 00:51:13,174
No. There's always logic.

899
00:51:13,258 --> 00:51:15,510
They know we read their mail.

900
00:51:15,593 --> 00:51:19,804
They're trying to make us think
their fleet is moving south.

901
00:51:19,888 --> 00:51:21,680
I'm not buying it.

902
00:51:21,722 --> 00:51:24,765
Something, something's up.

903
00:51:24,849 --> 00:51:28,643
Otherwise, why would they take
the trouble to bullshit me?

904
00:51:40,443 --> 00:51:43,028
[Crying]

905
00:51:43,111 --> 00:51:47,573
Evelyn, I signed for
these letters for you today.

906
00:51:47,698 --> 00:51:50,116
They're from England.

907
00:51:50,199 --> 00:51:51,784
They're from Rafe.

908
00:51:51,909 --> 00:51:53,868
I'm sorry, Ev.

909
00:51:53,910 --> 00:51:56,662
You know how long
it takes mail to get here.

910
00:52:10,255 --> 00:52:11,380
Hurry up!

911
00:52:11,464 --> 00:52:13,048
Show time, boys! Come on!

912
00:52:16,426 --> 00:52:18,761
NARRATOR: America still
awaits Japan's response...

913
00:52:18,886 --> 00:52:20,261
to peace proposals.

914
00:52:20,345 --> 00:52:22,805
Ambassador Nomura
arrives in Washington...

915
00:52:22,889 --> 00:52:24,431
in what could
hopefully guarantee...

916
00:52:24,556 --> 00:52:26,850
continued peace in the Pacific.

917
00:52:26,933 --> 00:52:29,309
On the British front,
Churchill declares...

918
00:52:29,393 --> 00:52:32,436
"Give us the tools,
and we will finish thejob."

919
00:52:34,730 --> 00:52:37,106
The RAF has fought
bravely against...

920
00:52:37,190 --> 00:52:42,068
Hitler's ambition to rule
the skies over the Channel.

921
00:52:42,110 --> 00:52:45,612
Victory does not come
without sacrifice.

922
00:52:48,650 --> 00:52:49,775
Evelyn!

923
00:52:49,859 --> 00:52:51,278
- Danny.
- Hey.

924
00:52:51,320 --> 00:52:53,237
Some comedy, huh?

925
00:52:54,321 --> 00:52:56,324
[Sighs] Yeah.

926
00:52:56,449 --> 00:52:58,408
It's been a while.

927
00:52:58,492 --> 00:53:00,995
I've been logging
a lot of flight hours.

928
00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:03,956
I kinda been avoiding you, too.

929
00:53:03,998 --> 00:53:05,748
Yeah.

930
00:53:05,832 --> 00:53:08,002
- Look-
- Do you-

931
00:53:08,085 --> 00:53:09,294
Do you want to?

932
00:53:09,336 --> 00:53:11,463
Sure, yeah.

933
00:53:11,505 --> 00:53:13,507
DANNY: I remember
one time when I was...

934
00:53:13,548 --> 00:53:15,091
like, seven years old...

935
00:53:15,175 --> 00:53:17,552
I was always building
gadgets and things.

936
00:53:17,635 --> 00:53:19,679
He wanted me
to build him some wings...

937
00:53:19,762 --> 00:53:21,597
so he could fly like his daddy.

938
00:53:21,681 --> 00:53:24,809
I told him you can't fly
without some kind of engine.

939
00:53:24,850 --> 00:53:26,477
But he wouldn't listen.

940
00:53:26,560 --> 00:53:29,021
"Danny, never mind that,
just build 'em anyway."

941
00:53:29,104 --> 00:53:31,273
So I did.

942
00:53:31,356 --> 00:53:32,983
And I'm up there...

943
00:53:33,066 --> 00:53:35,027
strapping these big ol' wings
on his back...

944
00:53:35,151 --> 00:53:36,986
that we made
from paper and glue...

945
00:53:37,028 --> 00:53:39,405
and these massive silk bloomers
that we stole.

946
00:53:39,489 --> 00:53:41,908
He looked so stupid,
and I told him...

947
00:53:41,991 --> 00:53:44,326
"You can't jump off the barn
in these."

948
00:53:44,368 --> 00:53:46,078
And bam!

949
00:53:46,161 --> 00:53:48,789
He busted his leg on a backhoe.

950
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:55,338
God, I miss him.

951
00:53:55,421 --> 00:53:58,548
Yeah. But don't you think...

952
00:53:58,631 --> 00:54:00,717
that Rafe wasn't
back upthere next day.

953
00:54:00,842 --> 00:54:02,134
Cast and everything...

954
00:54:02,218 --> 00:54:05,971
telling me to make some
adjustments on those wings.

955
00:54:06,055 --> 00:54:07,515
BlLLY: Check this out!

956
00:54:07,599 --> 00:54:09,391
Crossroads of the Pacific.

957
00:54:09,475 --> 00:54:12,395
Tahiti-1,700 miles!

958
00:54:12,478 --> 00:54:14,688
All right!

959
00:54:14,729 --> 00:54:16,981
Say, Betty...

960
00:54:22,111 --> 00:54:24,740
W- wou...

961
00:54:25,906 --> 00:54:27,951
- No, Betty! Get up!
- What's going on, Red?

962
00:54:28,034 --> 00:54:30,911
- Stand up, please.
- What do you mean?

963
00:54:30,994 --> 00:54:32,789
Just stand up.

964
00:54:32,914 --> 00:54:34,873
Stand...

965
00:54:34,956 --> 00:54:37,376
Oh! Ha!

966
00:54:37,460 --> 00:54:39,043
Betty...

967
00:54:39,128 --> 00:54:40,212
BlLLY: Red, come on!

968
00:54:40,337 --> 00:54:42,964
We got a dinner reservation.

969
00:54:44,758 --> 00:54:46,383
Can I get a minute?

970
00:54:48,386 --> 00:54:49,846
What's the matter, you sick?

971
00:54:51,556 --> 00:54:53,182
Can a guy propose?!

972
00:54:55,016 --> 00:54:56,852
Oh! Thank you!

973
00:54:56,936 --> 00:54:58,729
DANNY:Am I talking too much?

974
00:54:58,812 --> 00:55:01,398
Sometimes I do that, I'm sorry.

975
00:55:03,525 --> 00:55:04,693
BARBARA: Hold up!

976
00:55:04,776 --> 00:55:06,403
Look at this.

977
00:55:06,486 --> 00:55:08,029
Hello!

978
00:55:08,113 --> 00:55:10,615
OK, let's get out of here.

979
00:55:10,698 --> 00:55:11,866
OK.

980
00:55:14,577 --> 00:55:16,996
I guess I should go.

981
00:55:17,079 --> 00:55:19,749
Don't let it be three months
before I see you again.

982
00:55:19,832 --> 00:55:21,166
I had a good time.

983
00:55:21,250 --> 00:55:22,501
Yeah, me, too.

984
00:55:24,086 --> 00:55:25,921
Do you want me
to walk you home?

985
00:55:25,962 --> 00:55:27,590
No, I'll be fine.

986
00:55:27,632 --> 00:55:29,549
No...of course.

987
00:55:29,632 --> 00:55:31,760
- Good night.
- Good night.

988
00:55:43,730 --> 00:55:46,982
I was just wondering if maybe
I could come by some time...

989
00:55:47,065 --> 00:55:49,776
get a cup of coffee
or a piece of pie?

990
00:55:49,859 --> 00:55:52,571
What am I doing?

991
00:55:53,863 --> 00:55:55,448
OK.

992
00:55:58,909 --> 00:56:00,995
Oh! You were asleep. I'm sorry.

993
00:56:01,079 --> 00:56:02,788
Danny?

994
00:56:02,871 --> 00:56:04,123
Is something wrong?

995
00:56:04,207 --> 00:56:06,291
No! Nothing's wrong.
No problem. Hi!

996
00:56:06,333 --> 00:56:08,919
It's just Danny.

997
00:56:09,003 --> 00:56:10,920
I...just...you...

998
00:56:11,004 --> 00:56:13,090
you forgot this.

999
00:56:13,173 --> 00:56:17,302
Oh...thanks.

1000
00:56:17,427 --> 00:56:19,261
It was good of you
to take the trouble...

1001
00:56:19,345 --> 00:56:21,306
to drop it over...now.

1002
00:56:21,431 --> 00:56:23,808
I...well, I thought
you might need it.

1003
00:56:23,850 --> 00:56:26,727
You know...
maybe tomorrow morning.

1004
00:56:26,811 --> 00:56:27,978
If...

1005
00:56:28,020 --> 00:56:29,772
not that you wear this
to work, but...

1006
00:56:29,855 --> 00:56:31,815
No...it's a hankie.

1007
00:56:33,817 --> 00:56:37,070
Right, right. Yeah.

1008
00:56:38,863 --> 00:56:43,743
Listen, I was thinking maybe...
I could come by some time...

1009
00:56:43,826 --> 00:56:46,454
if I gave you a call,
could I come by?

1010
00:56:48,247 --> 00:56:51,292
Once, maybe...
if you're not busy?

1011
00:56:52,459 --> 00:56:53,627
Yeah, maybe.

1012
00:56:53,710 --> 00:56:56,213
- Maybe?
- Maybe.

1013
00:56:56,254 --> 00:56:57,506
OK, all right.

1014
00:56:57,547 --> 00:56:59,424
Thanks.

1015
00:56:59,507 --> 00:57:00,675
Good-bye. Good night.

1016
00:57:00,717 --> 00:57:02,260
You are such an idiot!

1017
00:57:07,640 --> 00:57:08,974
Did you have fun last night?

1018
00:57:10,059 --> 00:57:11,477
It wasn't how it looked.

1019
00:57:11,560 --> 00:57:13,395
And if it was,
it'd be all right.

1020
00:57:13,479 --> 00:57:15,480
It's been months.
It's time to move on.

1021
00:57:15,564 --> 00:57:17,315
I am moving on.

1022
00:57:17,399 --> 00:57:18,900
BETTY: Ev, don't lie.

1023
00:57:18,984 --> 00:57:21,486
All I know is, I hear you crying
when you think I'm asleep.

1024
00:57:21,611 --> 00:57:23,571
When my dad left...

1025
00:57:23,696 --> 00:57:25,823
I was too much
for my mom to handle...

1026
00:57:25,907 --> 00:57:27,868
so she sent me
to live with my aunt.

1027
00:57:27,909 --> 00:57:29,910
I thought my life was over...

1028
00:57:29,994 --> 00:57:32,497
But you don't know
where it's all gonna lead.

1029
00:57:32,580 --> 00:57:34,831
If I hadn't run away
and lied about my age...

1030
00:57:34,915 --> 00:57:36,167
and enlisted in the Navy...

1031
00:57:36,250 --> 00:57:38,877
I wouldn't have met Red, and...

1032
00:57:38,919 --> 00:57:40,713
now he's my fiance.

1033
00:57:42,755 --> 00:57:45,008
Oh, God, I can't
get used to that word.

1034
00:57:45,092 --> 00:57:47,218
- It's only been twelve hours.
- Oh, Betty!

1035
00:57:47,259 --> 00:57:49,012
Little Betty
beat us all to the post.

1036
00:57:49,096 --> 00:57:50,263
MARTHA: And this is ward three.

1037
00:57:50,347 --> 00:57:52,849
As you can see, no patients.

1038
00:57:52,932 --> 00:57:55,225
Welcome to Hawaii.
Come on, I'll show you the bar.

1039
00:57:55,309 --> 00:57:57,395
Sandra, new recruits to torture.

1040
00:57:57,478 --> 00:57:59,271
Come on. Excuse me, ladies?

1041
00:57:59,354 --> 00:58:00,523
Hi!

1042
00:58:02,358 --> 00:58:04,109
We're gonna wait two years
until I'm nineteen...

1043
00:58:04,193 --> 00:58:05,736
and Red can buy me a ring.

1044
00:58:05,819 --> 00:58:07,778
[Laughs]

1045
00:58:07,862 --> 00:58:10,448
Rafe sent his best friend
to tell you...

1046
00:58:10,532 --> 00:58:13,535
so you would be OK,
so you can move on.

1047
00:58:15,119 --> 00:58:16,871
You gotta go on living, Ev.

1048
00:58:23,961 --> 00:58:25,212
Red!

1049
00:58:26,380 --> 00:58:28,299
Whoo! Sorry!

1050
00:58:44,564 --> 00:58:47,065
[Whispers] Bye, Rafe.

1051
00:58:49,193 --> 00:58:51,444
VICEADMIRAL:
The Japanese Fleet is missing.

1052
00:58:51,486 --> 00:58:54,364
They're operating
under radio silence.

1053
00:58:54,447 --> 00:58:58,993
This footage was shot
four days ago on October 28th.

1054
00:59:02,121 --> 00:59:04,999
OFFICER: We're sending
scout planes in wider vectors...

1055
00:59:05,083 --> 00:59:07,501
all over the Pacific,
but they get nothing.

1056
00:59:07,584 --> 00:59:09,795
They could be anywhere in here.

1057
00:59:09,837 --> 00:59:12,965
I don't understand how
two whole carrier divisions...

1058
00:59:13,007 --> 00:59:15,508
can just disappear.

1059
00:59:21,098 --> 00:59:22,390
Clear!

1060
00:59:31,523 --> 00:59:33,609
Aw, we're all over the page.

1061
00:59:33,692 --> 00:59:35,485
We got one wall-eyed
and one pigeon-toed.

1062
00:59:35,568 --> 00:59:38,197
Anthony, tap in number six.
All right.

1063
00:59:38,322 --> 00:59:40,239
Gooz, tap in number three.

1064
00:59:40,322 --> 00:59:41,575
All right.

1065
00:59:41,658 --> 00:59:44,619
Hey. We got a visitor.

1066
00:59:44,702 --> 00:59:47,622
Oh...that ain't
no Navy issue uniform, eh?

1067
00:59:47,705 --> 00:59:49,457
BlLLY: Danny, it's Evelyn.

1068
00:59:49,540 --> 00:59:51,000
Jesus!

1069
00:59:51,083 --> 00:59:53,627
You allright?

1070
00:59:53,711 --> 00:59:55,629
Yeah. Yeah.

1071
00:59:55,713 --> 00:59:57,297
No.

1072
00:59:57,381 --> 00:59:59,841
I think I'm fallin' for her.

1073
00:59:59,925 --> 01:00:01,676
Wow. You know,
I saw this coming.

1074
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:03,053
[Chuckles]

1075
01:00:03,136 --> 01:00:04,680
I didn't want this to happen.

1076
01:00:04,764 --> 01:00:06,764
It just kind of did.
Can't help it.

1077
01:00:06,889 --> 01:00:08,391
Well, Danny,
she's gotta be with somebody.

1078
01:00:08,516 --> 01:00:09,976
It might as well be you.

1079
01:00:10,059 --> 01:00:11,269
You telling me
if you were dead...

1080
01:00:11,394 --> 01:00:13,312
and you saw your best buddy
doin' your girl...

1081
01:00:13,395 --> 01:00:15,939
you wouldn't come back and beat
the living crap outta him?

1082
01:00:16,023 --> 01:00:18,442
- Tony, back off.
- I'd be back so fast.

1083
01:00:18,525 --> 01:00:21,195
Danny's being a better friend
taking care of her himself.

1084
01:00:21,279 --> 01:00:23,196
I got a girlfriend.

1085
01:00:27,450 --> 01:00:28,827
That's great.

1086
01:00:28,911 --> 01:00:31,203
Come on, fellas.
Let's split.

1087
01:00:31,287 --> 01:00:34,540
Danny, whatever happens now
is just about you and her.

1088
01:00:34,623 --> 01:00:36,709
You gotta try
and forget about Rafe.

1089
01:00:36,751 --> 01:00:38,877
GOOZ: Be careful, allright?

1090
01:00:38,919 --> 01:00:42,006
Ladies...cloud the mind.

1091
01:00:42,089 --> 01:00:45,092
- Thanks, Gooz.
- You're welcome.

1092
01:00:46,135 --> 01:00:47,885
Hey, Danny.

1093
01:00:50,430 --> 01:00:51,931
Where's everybody going?

1094
01:00:54,226 --> 01:00:56,101
Just bein' discreet.

1095
01:00:56,185 --> 01:00:58,062
Does it seem like everybody's
acting a little strange?

1096
01:00:58,104 --> 01:00:59,855
No. Nah.

1097
01:00:59,938 --> 01:01:01,232
Right.

1098
01:01:03,692 --> 01:01:06,028
Well, maybe-maybe a little.
Yeah.

1099
01:01:06,111 --> 01:01:08,071
Well, people in this outfit...

1100
01:01:08,154 --> 01:01:10,240
have way too much time
on their hands.

1101
01:01:10,324 --> 01:01:11,616
Oh, yeah.

1102
01:01:11,700 --> 01:01:12,909
I just hope they don't think
there's been something...

1103
01:01:12,993 --> 01:01:14,286
goin' on between us,
that's all.

1104
01:01:14,411 --> 01:01:16,787
Oh, no. I mean, no.
That would be...

1105
01:01:16,871 --> 01:01:18,248
embarrassing, right?

1106
01:01:18,289 --> 01:01:19,791
Forgot my wrenches.

1107
01:01:19,916 --> 01:01:21,375
That would definitely
be embarrassing.

1108
01:01:21,501 --> 01:01:22,835
Yeah.

1109
01:01:22,919 --> 01:01:25,087
Ha. Forgot my wrenches.

1110
01:01:25,171 --> 01:01:28,298
Hey. He really
doesn't have to leave.

1111
01:01:28,382 --> 01:01:29,883
No.

1112
01:01:29,967 --> 01:01:33,887
I, uh, I'm just goin'
out with the girls, so...

1113
01:01:33,970 --> 01:01:36,806
I guess I'll see you later.

1114
01:01:36,890 --> 01:01:39,100
- Yeah.
- All right.

1115
01:01:39,183 --> 01:01:40,935
Yeah, all right.
I'll see you around.

1116
01:01:42,353 --> 01:01:43,604
Shit.

1117
01:01:44,563 --> 01:01:46,607
Evelyn.

1118
01:01:46,732 --> 01:01:48,734
Have you ever seen
Pearl Harbor at sunset?

1119
01:01:48,859 --> 01:01:50,777
Of course.

1120
01:01:50,819 --> 01:01:53,197
Well...from the air?

1121
01:01:57,159 --> 01:01:59,952
You know, I could get kicked
out of the military for this.

1122
01:02:00,036 --> 01:02:02,455
- Really?
- Yeah. Stay down.

1123
01:02:21,890 --> 01:02:24,308
DANNY: The Hawaiians called
this harbor Wai Momi.

1124
01:02:24,392 --> 01:02:26,186
It means "water of pearls."

1125
01:02:26,269 --> 01:02:27,895
It's so beautiful.

1126
01:02:27,978 --> 01:02:30,648
My dad took me up
a couple of times.

1127
01:02:30,732 --> 01:02:32,107
Just don't do what he did.

1128
01:02:32,190 --> 01:02:33,734
What do you call it
when you flip over?

1129
01:02:33,818 --> 01:02:34,944
DANNY: A barrelroll?

1130
01:02:35,027 --> 01:02:36,277
EVELYN: Yeah.

1131
01:02:36,361 --> 01:02:38,656
I won't.

1132
01:02:38,697 --> 01:02:39,906
Aah!

1133
01:02:46,037 --> 01:02:49,039
- Oh!
- Ha ha ha ha!

1134
01:02:49,081 --> 01:02:51,834
- Oh, God.
- What do you think?

1135
01:02:51,876 --> 01:02:53,544
I like that.

1136
01:03:03,387 --> 01:03:04,721
MAN: Hey!

1137
01:03:04,805 --> 01:03:07,057
That plane was supposed
to be back here an hour ago!

1138
01:03:07,140 --> 01:03:09,142
Quick, hide
in the parachute hangar.

1139
01:03:48,678 --> 01:03:51,056
My heart is pounding.

1140
01:04:38,475 --> 01:04:40,602
Danny, last night...

1141
01:04:40,685 --> 01:04:42,645
No, that's terrible.

1142
01:04:44,647 --> 01:04:47,316
Danny, we need
to talk about this.

1143
01:04:48,818 --> 01:04:50,778
Sir. Evelyn!

1144
01:04:50,819 --> 01:04:53,280
- Danny.
- Hey. Hi.

1145
01:04:54,656 --> 01:04:55,824
Hi.

1146
01:04:57,827 --> 01:04:59,744
I didn't sleep a wink
last night.

1147
01:04:59,828 --> 01:05:02,289
I had to see you.

1148
01:05:02,372 --> 01:05:04,874
Last night was crazy,
I know, but...

1149
01:05:04,957 --> 01:05:07,168
I'm not sorry. Are you?

1150
01:05:09,336 --> 01:05:10,796
I don't know.

1151
01:05:12,714 --> 01:05:16,676
Danny, I had a wonderful
time last night. I-

1152
01:05:16,802 --> 01:05:18,346
It's just all too fast.

1153
01:05:18,429 --> 01:05:21,014
Listen, Evelyn, I was just down
at the beach this morning...

1154
01:05:21,097 --> 01:05:22,891
and I watched the sun rise...

1155
01:05:22,975 --> 01:05:24,934
and I knew that everything
was gonna be different.

1156
01:05:25,017 --> 01:05:28,604
That this was the start
of something new.

1157
01:05:28,687 --> 01:05:31,608
In this place, in this moment.

1158
01:05:31,690 --> 01:05:34,944
And I don't care what
anybody else says, you know?

1159
01:05:35,028 --> 01:05:37,989
How can I not feel this way?

1160
01:05:39,532 --> 01:05:41,366
I kinda like you.

1161
01:05:44,244 --> 01:05:45,828
Oh, you do?

1162
01:05:50,667 --> 01:05:52,627
You have your tie on crooked.

1163
01:05:56,297 --> 01:05:59,175
Everything's
gonna be all right, OK?

1164
01:06:00,593 --> 01:06:02,636
Everything's
gonna be all right.

1165
01:06:11,353 --> 01:06:15,815
Do you have any airtours going
through the valley of Oahu?

1166
01:06:16,941 --> 01:06:18,401
You do?

1167
01:06:30,704 --> 01:06:33,706
MALE RADIOHOST:Aloha.
This is KGMB in Honolulu...

1168
01:06:33,790 --> 01:06:37,001
on another beautiful
fall day here in paradise.

1169
01:06:40,838 --> 01:06:43,257
SPY:
We have enough information.

1170
01:06:45,342 --> 01:06:47,427
We are returning home.

1171
01:07:16,205 --> 01:07:17,371
EVELYN: Do you ever wonder...

1172
01:07:17,455 --> 01:07:19,249
if this war's
gonna catch up with us?

1173
01:07:20,333 --> 01:07:22,752
DANNY: Nota whole lot.

1174
01:07:22,794 --> 01:07:26,923
Every moment we're not together,
you're upthere training for it.

1175
01:07:28,883 --> 01:07:32,094
Yeah, well, I'm training
for moments like these...

1176
01:07:32,178 --> 01:07:33,761
'cause I have no idea...

1177
01:07:33,845 --> 01:07:36,390
how I'm gonna get this car
out of the sand.

1178
01:07:36,473 --> 01:07:37,932
Evelyn, can you please
come out of the bathroom?

1179
01:07:38,015 --> 01:07:40,018
You've been there for an hour.

1180
01:07:40,102 --> 01:07:42,604
Evelyn! What are you
trying to do, look like me?

1181
01:07:42,687 --> 01:07:43,855
[Women giggle]

1182
01:07:45,064 --> 01:07:46,941
BARBARA: Are you OK?

1183
01:07:47,025 --> 01:07:48,151
Yeah.

1184
01:07:48,234 --> 01:07:49,735
What's the matter?
No, you-

1185
01:07:49,819 --> 01:07:52,321
D'oy.

1186
01:07:52,405 --> 01:07:54,280
They call it the vacant sea.

1187
01:07:54,364 --> 01:07:56,325
None of the major sea lanes
go through it...

1188
01:07:56,408 --> 01:07:59,286
and you can bury the entire
land mass of Asia there...

1189
01:07:59,328 --> 01:08:01,204
and nobody would know.

1190
01:08:01,288 --> 01:08:04,416
ADMIRAL: From there,
they could attack anywhere.

1191
01:08:04,499 --> 01:08:05,959
VICEADMIRAL:
Our last signals intercept...

1192
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,711
indicate that the Japanese
taskforce is heading south...

1193
01:08:08,795 --> 01:08:10,588
towards the Philippines
or southeast Asia.

1194
01:08:10,672 --> 01:08:12,965
But Captain Thurman
of Naval intelligence here...

1195
01:08:13,007 --> 01:08:14,801
has his own theory
about the missing ships.

1196
01:08:16,009 --> 01:08:18,470
Sir, I believe
they'll try to hit us...

1197
01:08:18,512 --> 01:08:20,514
where it'll hurt us the most-
Pearl Harbor.

1198
01:08:20,597 --> 01:08:23,600
It's over 4,000 nautical miles
from Japan to Pearl.

1199
01:08:23,683 --> 01:08:27,979
That's a long distance
to steam a navy, Captain.

1200
01:08:28,021 --> 01:08:30,314
Your theory is based on what?

1201
01:08:30,356 --> 01:08:32,983
Well, it's what I would do.

1202
01:08:33,067 --> 01:08:35,987
ADMIRAL: That's not exactly
hard evidence, Captain Thurman.

1203
01:08:36,029 --> 01:08:37,446
Well, Admiral,
if I had hard evidence...

1204
01:08:37,529 --> 01:08:38,865
we'd already be at war.

1205
01:08:38,948 --> 01:08:40,657
Sir, we can read
their diplomatic codes...

1206
01:08:40,699 --> 01:08:41,992
faster than they can type them.

1207
01:08:42,075 --> 01:08:43,661
But Captain Thurman's
cryptology team...

1208
01:08:43,744 --> 01:08:45,495
is still trying
to crack the naval codes.

1209
01:08:45,578 --> 01:08:48,457
The intercepts have missing
words and garbled lines...

1210
01:08:48,540 --> 01:08:52,252
so to explain the decrypts,
we have to try to interpret...

1211
01:08:52,377 --> 01:08:53,419
what we think
they're trying to do.

1212
01:08:53,544 --> 01:08:56,673
Interpret?
You mean guess.

1213
01:08:56,714 --> 01:08:59,217
They use
their informed intuition, sir.

1214
01:08:59,300 --> 01:09:01,676
We guess.

1215
01:09:01,718 --> 01:09:03,179
It's like playing chess
in the dark.

1216
01:09:03,220 --> 01:09:05,847
Any rumor, troop movement,
ship movement...

1217
01:09:05,930 --> 01:09:08,183
spine-tingle, goose bump,
we pay attention to it.

1218
01:09:08,267 --> 01:09:10,184
When I was in
the Asiatic Fleet...

1219
01:09:10,226 --> 01:09:12,396
the locals used to try
to get outside of a problem...

1220
01:09:12,479 --> 01:09:13,854
to try to see the inside.

1221
01:09:13,938 --> 01:09:15,482
Well, I see a strike on Pearl.

1222
01:09:15,565 --> 01:09:17,150
It's the worst thing
that could happen.

1223
01:09:17,233 --> 01:09:18,358
A blow to Pearl
would devastate...

1224
01:09:18,400 --> 01:09:20,736
the Pacific Fleet's
ability to make war.

1225
01:09:20,862 --> 01:09:24,073
So, sir, you would have us
mobilize the entire fleet...

1226
01:09:24,198 --> 01:09:27,159
at the cost
of millions of dollars...

1227
01:09:27,242 --> 01:09:29,620
based on this spine-tingling
feeling of yours?

1228
01:09:29,703 --> 01:09:33,540
No, sir. My job is to gather
and interpret material.

1229
01:09:33,623 --> 01:09:35,792
Making difficult decisions...

1230
01:09:35,875 --> 01:09:37,335
based on
incomplete information...

1231
01:09:37,418 --> 01:09:40,213
from my limited
decoding ability...

1232
01:09:40,254 --> 01:09:42,715
is your job, sir.

1233
01:09:42,757 --> 01:09:45,176
Then break the damn naval code,
Captain...

1234
01:09:45,259 --> 01:09:47,011
so I can make a better decision.

1235
01:09:47,095 --> 01:09:50,055
Aye, sir. We are trying.

1236
01:10:07,238 --> 01:10:09,990
I wonder if we shouldn't put
the Pacific Fleet on full alert.

1237
01:10:16,372 --> 01:10:17,497
ADMIRAL KIMMEL:
In case the optimism...

1238
01:10:17,580 --> 01:10:20,459
of the "Honolulu Advertiser"
proves unfounded, gentlemen...

1239
01:10:21,542 --> 01:10:22,793
what are General Short
and the Army...

1240
01:10:22,877 --> 01:10:24,629
going to do
about protecting my ships?

1241
01:10:24,713 --> 01:10:27,172
Within a ten-mile radius
of your harbor...

1242
01:10:27,299 --> 01:10:29,134
we have fighterplanes
here at Wheeler...

1243
01:10:29,258 --> 01:10:31,469

a trainingstrip at Haleiwa.

[Ding ding]

1245
01:10:41,853 --> 01:10:43,313
We've recently established
a radar station here...

1246
01:10:43,397 --> 01:10:46,440
that can detect planes
125 miles out.

1247
01:10:46,523 --> 01:10:48,777
Which is a month old, Admiral,
and untested.

1248
01:10:48,860 --> 01:10:51,612
I've seen
these new radar screens, Major.

1249
01:10:51,654 --> 01:10:53,239
There's no way of telling
whether they're ours, theirs...

1250
01:10:53,322 --> 01:10:54,990
or a flock of damn birds.

1251

a call from Tokyo...

1252

DENTALASSISTANT:
There's a call from Tokyo.

1254
01:11:02,539 --> 01:11:03,832
They say they don't know you.

1255
01:11:06,001 --> 01:11:08,128

LISTENER:
It's a local dentist.

1259
01:11:16,343 --> 01:11:19,054
He can see Pearl Harbor
from his office.

1260
01:11:19,138 --> 01:11:21,140
Are there many sailors around?

[Speaking Japanese]

1262
01:11:26,186 --> 01:11:28,646
LISTENER: Uh, the dentist
says that the flatships...

1263
01:11:28,688 --> 01:11:30,440
are not in port.

1264
01:11:30,523 --> 01:11:33,192
They're talking about
the weather.

1265
01:11:33,276 --> 01:11:35,444
He doesn't seem to know
who he's talking to.

1266
01:11:35,529 --> 01:11:37,196
- Hello?

Hello? Moshi moshi.

1268
01:11:39,532 --> 01:11:41,241
Hello?

1269
01:11:41,325 --> 01:11:43,661
That was a strange call.

1270
01:11:45,954 --> 01:11:47,665
Admiral,
may I speak to you in private?

1271
01:11:49,165 --> 01:11:50,708
ADMIRAL KIMMEL:
Why would a spy use a phone?

1272
01:11:50,792 --> 01:11:52,419
They know we tap
all international lines.

1273
01:11:52,503 --> 01:11:54,670
Our listeners feel
it's probably not code talk.

1274
01:11:54,754 --> 01:11:56,423
It sounds like someone in Japan
is sneaking around...

1275
01:11:56,506 --> 01:11:58,632
asking a local citizen
the location of our carriers.

1276
01:11:58,716 --> 01:12:01,010
Well, that makes me feel
all warm inside.

1277
01:12:01,094 --> 01:12:03,888
Get the FBI on it immediately.

1278
01:12:03,971 --> 01:12:06,223
Have we found
the goddamn Japanese Fleet yet?

1279
01:12:06,306 --> 01:12:08,809
No, Admiral. The bases are
looking all over the Pacific.

1280
01:12:08,934 --> 01:12:10,852
So the entire fleet could be
rounding Diamond Head...

1281
01:12:10,893 --> 01:12:12,896
and we wouldn't know
a thing about it.

1282
01:12:13,021 --> 01:12:14,146
Get on it.

1283
01:12:48,679 --> 01:12:50,639

1296

I know. Me, too.

1297
01:14:15,717 --> 01:14:18,304
Every second. So did I.

1298
01:14:18,387 --> 01:14:20,598
I thought you were dead.

1299
01:14:20,681 --> 01:14:22,474
They said you were shot down
in the sea.

1300
01:14:22,600 --> 01:14:24,685
Yeah, I was.

1301
01:14:24,810 --> 01:14:27,729
I was in the ocean.
It was so cold.

01:14:27,813 --> 01:14:30,023
I missed you.

1303
01:14:30,106 --> 01:14:33,193
I got picked up
by a French fishing boat...

1304
01:14:33,276 --> 01:14:36,237
and I was in occupied France,
and I couldn't get word out.

all about it, I promise.

You left her to fight
somebody else's war...

and you made damn sure
that I didn't go with you...

that you were dead-

that went through my mind...

me to act like it's all right!

you can get used to that.

Hey, Rafe, I'm not sure
we have enough runway!

Find some way to mark 'em...

1849
01:59:45,532 --> 01:59:49,494
So we can keep track
of who's got morphine already.

1850
01:59:49,535 --> 01:59:51,412
Tell me about your ship.
What ship are you from?

1851
01:59:51,495 --> 01:59:54,081
It's not marking.
Have you got a marker?

1852
01:59:58,377 --> 02:00:01,317
Use my lipstick!
Put "M" for morphine.

1853
02:00:01,369 --> 02:00:04,258
- We need a tourniquet!

to make him comfortable?

02:01:30,097 --> 02:01:31,171
He won't make it.

02:05:51,329 --> 02:05:52,746
[Shouting]

1922
02:05:54,207 --> 02:05:57,334
[Banging and yelling]

1923
02:05:57,375 --> 02:05:59,045
There's somebody in here!

1924
02:05:59,170 --> 02:06:00,920
Get somebody down here!

1925
02:06:03,340 --> 02:06:04,758
They're cutting through!

1926
02:06:04,800 --> 02:06:06,760
[Cheering]

1927
02:06:10,347 --> 02:06:13,474
MAN: I hear somebody!
Get some guys up here!

1928
02:06:13,526 --> 02:06:15,518
ALL: Pull!

1929
02:06:18,229 --> 02:06:21,357
MAN: [Muffled] Get us out!
It's filling with water!

1930
02:06:21,398 --> 02:06:23,067
Get an airline in here!

1931
02:06:23,108 --> 02:06:25,737
[Screaming]

1932
02:06:25,778 --> 02:06:28,655
We need the air hose!
What can we do?

1933
02:06:33,076 --> 02:06:35,495
It won't cut any faster!

1934
02:06:35,536 --> 02:06:38,373
[Gurgling cries]

1935
02:06:38,415 --> 02:06:41,793
- Cut him out!
- Aah!

1936
02:07:13,989 --> 02:07:15,407
ROOSEVELT: Yesterday...

1937
02:07:15,449 --> 02:07:19,828
December 7, 1941...

1938
02:07:21,036 --> 02:07:24,290
a date
which will live in infamy...

1939
02:07:24,342 --> 02:07:27,293
the United States of America...

1940
02:07:27,377 --> 02:07:30,421
was suddenly
and deliberately attacked...

1941
02:07:30,588 --> 02:07:35,175
by naval and air forces
of the empire of Japan.

1942
02:07:37,593 --> 02:07:38,762
ROOSEVELT: It is obvious...

1943
02:07:38,845 --> 02:07:43,433
that planning the attack
began many weeks ago.

1944
02:07:43,475 --> 02:07:45,956
During the intervening time...

1945
02:07:46,008 --> 02:07:48,438
the Japanese government...

1946
02:07:48,479 --> 02:07:52,024
has deliberately sought to
deceive the United States...

1947
02:07:52,076 --> 02:07:54,151
by false statements...

1948
02:07:54,193 --> 02:07:58,905
and expressions of hope
for continued peace.

1949
02:07:59,031 --> 02:08:03,910
The attack yesterday
on the Hawaiian Islands...

1950
02:08:04,035 --> 02:08:09,165
has caused severe damage
to American military forces.

1951
02:08:09,207 --> 02:08:10,751
I regret to tell you...

1952
02:08:10,792 --> 02:08:16,171
that over 3,000 American lives
have been lost.

1953
02:08:16,213 --> 02:08:19,216
No matter how long
it may take us...

1954
02:08:19,341 --> 02:08:23,012
to overcome
this premeditated invasion...

1955
02:08:23,054 --> 02:08:27,224
the American people,
in their righteous might...

1956
02:08:27,349 --> 02:08:29,934
will win through
to absolute victory.

1957
02:08:29,986 --> 02:08:31,936
[Applause]

1958
02:08:34,063 --> 02:08:40,069
Because of this unprovoked,
dastardly attack by Japan...

1959
02:08:40,235 --> 02:08:44,031
I ask that the Congress
declare a state of war.

1960
02:08:47,931 --> 02:08:49,930
[Applause]

1961
02:08:50,933 --> 02:08:52,392
Is it true...

1962
02:08:52,476 --> 02:08:56,062
men are still trapped alive
inside the Arizona?

1963
02:08:58,063 --> 02:09:00,066
We can hear tapping
from inside the hull.

1964
02:09:00,191 --> 02:09:01,733
We're doing everything we can
to get to them...

1965
02:09:01,775 --> 02:09:03,653
but they're
forty feet below water.

1966
02:09:10,241 --> 02:09:13,473
We've been trained to think
that we're invincible.

1967
02:09:13,525 --> 02:09:16,706
And now our proudest ships
have been destroyed...

1968
02:09:16,790 --> 02:09:20,710
by an enemy
we considered inferior.

1969
02:09:20,793 --> 02:09:23,045
We're on the ropes, gentlemen.

1970
02:09:23,087 --> 02:09:27,049
That's exactly why
we have to strike back now.

1971
02:09:27,091 --> 02:09:29,916
We'll attack the Marshall
and Gilbert Islands, sir.

1972
02:09:29,968 --> 02:09:33,805
I mean hitting the heart of
Japan the way they have hit us.

1973
02:09:35,682 --> 02:09:37,684
Mr. President...

1974
02:09:37,725 --> 02:09:41,145
Pearl Harbor caught us unawares
because we didn't face facts.

1975
02:09:41,270 --> 02:09:44,221
This isn't a time
for ignoring them again.

1976
02:09:44,273 --> 02:09:47,693
We have long-range bombers,
but no place to launch them.

1977
02:09:47,735 --> 02:09:51,571
Midway is too far,
and Russia won't allow us...

1978
02:09:51,697 --> 02:09:52,989
to launch a raid from there.

1979
02:09:54,282 --> 02:09:55,368
Admiral?

1980
02:09:55,409 --> 02:09:56,826
Navy's planes are small.

1981
02:09:56,868 --> 02:09:58,704
They carry light loads
and have a short range.

1982
02:09:58,829 --> 02:10:02,123
We'd have to get them within
a few hundred miles of Japan.

1983
02:10:02,175 --> 02:10:05,292
We'd risk our carriers,
and if we lose them...

1984
02:10:05,344 --> 02:10:07,003
we'll have no shield
against invasion.

1985
02:10:07,128 --> 02:10:10,047
Does anyone in this room
think victory is possible...

1986
02:10:10,130 --> 02:10:11,716
without facing danger?

1987
02:10:11,841 --> 02:10:14,760
We are at war.
Of course there's a risk.

1988
02:10:14,885 --> 02:10:17,011
But consider the risk,
Mr. President.

1989
02:10:17,137 --> 02:10:19,890
If the Japanese
invade us right now...

1990
02:10:20,015 --> 02:10:23,018
they would reach Chicago
before we could stop them.

1991
02:10:25,311 --> 02:10:27,188
Gentlemen...

1992
02:10:28,898 --> 02:10:33,860
most of you did not know me
when I had the use of my legs.

1993
02:10:33,902 --> 02:10:37,614
I was strong and proud...
and arrogant.

1994
02:10:37,697 --> 02:10:41,451
Now I wonder,
every hour of my life...

1995
02:10:41,493 --> 02:10:45,372
why God put me into this chair.

1996
02:10:45,455 --> 02:10:48,917
But when I see defeat
in the eyes of my country men-

1997
02:10:48,969 --> 02:10:51,284
in your eyes, right now-

1998
02:10:51,336 --> 02:10:54,337
I start to think that
maybe he brought me down...

1999
02:10:54,462 --> 02:10:55,756
for times like these...

2000
02:10:55,798 --> 02:10:58,466
when we all need to be reminded
who we truly are-

2001
02:10:58,633 --> 02:11:01,762
that we will not
give up or give in.

2002
02:11:01,803 --> 02:11:03,221
ADMIRAL: Mr. President,
with all respect, sir...

2003
02:11:03,347 --> 02:11:05,223
what you're asking
can't be done.

2004
02:11:21,238 --> 02:11:23,657
- Mr. President!
- Get back, George!

2005
02:11:23,709 --> 02:11:24,950
Get back.

2006
02:11:37,253 --> 02:11:39,798
Do not tell me...

2007
02:11:39,839 --> 02:11:41,965
it can't be done.

2008
02:11:46,678 --> 02:11:49,681
NARRATOR: Japan continues
its military conquest...

2009
02:11:49,722 --> 02:11:50,848
throughout the Pacific.

2010
02:11:52,559 --> 02:11:54,049
But, back home...

2011
02:11:54,101 --> 02:11:56,521
millions of American workers
band together...

2012
02:11:56,563 --> 02:11:59,441
bringing factories to life
to avenge Pearl Harbor.

2013
02:12:03,986 --> 02:12:06,696
Mr. President, we have an idea
how to bomb the Japanese.

2014
02:12:06,821 --> 02:12:09,575
MARSHALL:
Sir, it's risky...

2015
02:12:09,627 --> 02:12:11,118
but it's bold.

2016
02:12:12,745 --> 02:12:15,163
- Who are you?
- I, sir?

2017
02:12:15,289 --> 02:12:16,873
Captain Low, Mr. President.

2018
02:12:18,290 --> 02:12:20,460
He's a submariner.
He came up with this idea.

2019
02:12:20,585 --> 02:12:23,003
I like sub commanders.

2020
02:12:23,045 --> 02:12:27,173
They don't have time
for bullshit, and neither do I.

2021
02:12:27,300 --> 02:12:28,759
Fire away, gentlemen.

2022
02:12:29,009 --> 02:12:31,887
[Playing "The Last Post"]

2023
02:12:45,441 --> 02:12:47,319
MINISTER:
And where is God in all this?

2024
02:12:49,153 --> 02:12:53,907
MINISTER: Our enemies believe
a divine wind protects them.

2025
02:12:54,032 --> 02:12:57,744
But we see our friends
laid out here before us.

2026
02:13:19,640 --> 02:13:20,766
Hey, Captain.

2027
02:13:44,538 --> 02:13:46,122
Lieutenants Rafe McCawley,
Daniel Walker.

2028
02:13:46,247 --> 02:13:47,666
Yes, Major?

2029
02:13:47,833 --> 02:13:51,085
You're both going stateside.
Fly out in two hours.

2030
02:13:51,251 --> 02:13:52,504
What for, sir?

2031
02:13:52,545 --> 02:13:54,130
Ask Colonel Doolittle.

2032
02:13:57,800 --> 02:13:59,134
Yes, sir.

2033
02:14:14,857 --> 02:14:16,150
You're packing.

2034
02:14:19,403 --> 02:14:20,644
Orders.

2035
02:14:20,696 --> 02:14:23,407
What kind of orders?

2036
02:14:23,449 --> 02:14:26,994
[Sighs]
The top-secret kind.

2037
02:14:27,119 --> 02:14:29,162
The dangerous kind.

2038
02:14:31,164 --> 02:14:32,822
I can't find Danny.

2039
02:14:32,874 --> 02:14:35,168
Is that why you're here?

2040
02:14:35,293 --> 02:14:36,586
Looking for Danny?

2041
02:14:38,004 --> 02:14:39,297
Probably saying good-bye
to his squadron.

2042
02:14:39,380 --> 02:14:40,424
We've been assigned
to Doolittle.

2043
02:14:50,348 --> 02:14:52,018
I wasn't looking for Danny.

2044
02:14:57,314 --> 02:14:58,773
I couldn't have you go away...

2045
02:14:58,898 --> 02:15:00,734
without you
understanding something.

2046
02:15:06,321 --> 02:15:08,449
Yeah. You don't have
to explain anything.

2047
02:15:08,616 --> 02:15:12,912
I do, because you're acting
like I didn't love you.

2048
02:15:12,995 --> 02:15:16,081
Evelyn,
loving you kept me alive.

2049
02:15:27,049 --> 02:15:28,582
I should've died over there.

2050
02:15:28,634 --> 02:15:33,222
When I was in that water,
I made a deal with God.

2051
02:15:34,932 --> 02:15:36,590
I told him I was sorry...

2052
02:15:36,642 --> 02:15:39,393
that I knew I'd been a fool
for leaving you...

2053
02:15:39,477 --> 02:15:41,646
trying to go over there
and be a hero...

2054
02:15:43,064 --> 02:15:45,066
and I promised I'd never ask
for anything again...

2055
02:15:46,359 --> 02:15:49,237
if I could just see you
one more time.

2056
02:15:52,782 --> 02:15:53,949
And you know what?

2057
02:15:56,118 --> 02:15:57,411
It was worth it.

2058
02:15:59,371 --> 02:16:02,832
You kept me alive, Evelyn.
You brought me home.

2059
02:16:03,958 --> 02:16:06,252
So I'm gonna stand by
my end of the deal.

2060
02:16:06,336 --> 02:16:08,087
I'm gonna walk away.

2061
02:16:08,130 --> 02:16:11,382
And I won't ask you
for anything.

2062
02:16:11,549 --> 02:16:13,259
But I just want to know why.

2063
02:16:13,342 --> 02:16:16,262
Just tell me that, will you,
please? Just tell me why.

2064
02:16:17,846 --> 02:16:19,973
Rafe, I'm pregnant.

2065
02:16:29,024 --> 02:16:30,816
Oh, my God.

2066
02:16:34,153 --> 02:16:37,448
I didn't even know until
the day you turned up alive.

2067
02:16:39,032 --> 02:16:41,577
And then all this happened.

2068
02:16:43,286 --> 02:16:44,580
I haven't told Danny.

2069
02:16:46,165 --> 02:16:48,291
I don't want him to know.

2070
02:16:48,417 --> 02:16:50,294
All he needs to think about...

2071
02:16:50,335 --> 02:16:53,130
is how to do this mission
and get back alive.

2072
02:16:56,006 --> 02:16:59,249
Rafe, all I ever wanted...

2073
02:16:59,301 --> 02:17:02,471
was for us to have a home,
grow old together...

2074
02:17:02,597 --> 02:17:05,547
but life never asked me
what I wanted.

2075
02:17:05,599 --> 02:17:08,727
Now, I'm gonna give Danny
my whole heart...

2076
02:17:10,729 --> 02:17:13,023
but I don't think I'll ever
look at another sunset...

2077
02:17:13,064 --> 02:17:14,774
without thinking of you.

2078
02:17:18,903 --> 02:17:20,696
I'll love you my whole life.

2079
02:17:58,648 --> 02:18:00,525
I'll see you on board.

2080
02:18:18,000 --> 02:18:22,087
You know, the only thing
that scares me...

2081
02:18:22,129 --> 02:18:24,840
is that you might love him
more than you love me.

2082
02:18:27,549 --> 02:18:29,093
I love you, Danny.

2083
02:18:32,262 --> 02:18:34,974
And I'll be here waiting
for you when you come back.

2084
02:18:53,157 --> 02:18:54,283
Follow me.

2085
02:18:58,037 --> 02:18:59,455
Colonel.

2086
02:19:03,709 --> 02:19:05,460
Congratulations
on your promotion, sir.

2087
02:19:05,585 --> 02:19:07,295
I heard what you did.

2088
02:19:07,347 --> 02:19:09,005
We can explain that, sir.

2089
02:19:09,057 --> 02:19:10,757
Explain what?

2090
02:19:10,882 --> 02:19:13,593
Whatever it is
you heard about us, sir.

2091
02:19:13,718 --> 02:19:15,303
You mean the hula shirts
you were flying in?

2092
02:19:20,682 --> 02:19:22,976
Or the seven planes
you shot down?

2093
02:19:26,146 --> 02:19:29,608
You're both being awarded
the Silver Star...

2094
02:19:29,732 --> 02:19:31,609
and promoted to captain.

2095
02:19:33,070 --> 02:19:35,488
Is that the good news,
sir, or...

2096
02:19:35,613 --> 02:19:37,199
You're just about
the only pilots in the Army...

2097
02:19:37,324 --> 02:19:39,616
with combat experience.

2098
02:19:39,742 --> 02:19:41,327
I need you for a mission...

2099
02:19:41,369 --> 02:19:43,495
I've been ordered
to put together.

2100
02:19:45,038 --> 02:19:46,790
You know what top secret is?

2101
02:19:46,915 --> 02:19:48,156
Yes, sir.

2102
02:19:48,208 --> 02:19:50,918
It's the kind of mission
where you get medals.

2103
02:19:50,970 --> 02:19:53,161
But they send 'em
to your relatives.

2104
02:19:53,213 --> 02:19:55,339
Top secret means
you train for something...

2105
02:19:55,464 --> 02:19:57,874
never done before
in aviation history...

2106
02:19:57,926 --> 02:20:00,052
and you go without knowing
where you're going.

2107
02:20:01,387 --> 02:20:05,098
You do it on that basis
or not at all.

2108
02:20:05,224 --> 02:20:06,517
I'll go, sir.

2109
02:20:07,475 --> 02:20:09,353
I'll go, too, sir.

2110
02:20:11,522 --> 02:20:14,775
By the way, the Brits sent
over your personal effects.

2111
02:20:14,816 --> 02:20:15,941
Thank you, sir.

2112
02:20:16,067 --> 02:20:17,360
DOOLITTLE:
There's only one more thing.

2113
02:20:17,486 --> 02:20:21,239
Leave your goddamn hula shirts
at home.

2114
02:20:24,241 --> 02:20:25,368
EVELYN: Dear Rafe...

2115
02:20:25,535 --> 02:20:27,828
It's so strange
to be this far from you...

2116
02:20:27,953 --> 02:20:31,999
but you should know this-
every night...

2117
02:20:41,382 --> 02:20:43,551
I've been looking
all over for you.

2118
02:20:44,969 --> 02:20:46,679
[Sighing]
Danny, this...

2119
02:20:48,097 --> 02:20:50,266
this ain't no time
to leave things unsaid.

2120
02:20:51,558 --> 02:20:53,508
Now, we gotta face facts here.

2121
02:20:53,560 --> 02:20:56,813
The fact is, we just both love
the same woman.

2122
02:21:04,404 --> 02:21:07,406
She's the first girl I ever
felt this way about, Rafe.

2123
02:21:07,573 --> 02:21:09,868
[Sighs]

2124
02:21:09,993 --> 02:21:13,328
I couldn't help what happened
any more than you could.

2125
02:21:17,583 --> 02:21:19,876
This is different,
though, Danny.

2126
02:21:20,001 --> 02:21:21,670
Evelyn already lost
the man she loved once.

2127
02:21:21,712 --> 02:21:23,671
I just don't want it to see
that happen to her again.

2128
02:21:23,713 --> 02:21:26,883
Guys like us got no choice.
This is war.

2129
02:21:26,967 --> 02:21:28,467
She knows that.

2130
02:21:28,592 --> 02:21:31,012
Danny, don't do this.

2131
02:21:31,137 --> 02:21:32,471
Don't go on this mission.

2132
02:21:33,765 --> 02:21:35,599
You got nothing to prove.

2133
02:21:36,975 --> 02:21:39,312
You've been protecting me
since we were kids.

2134
02:21:40,895 --> 02:21:42,606
Yeah, well...

2135
02:21:42,648 --> 02:21:44,607
you do tend to need it
from time to time.

2136
02:22:04,209 --> 02:22:06,211
The mission I'm asking you
to volunteer for...

2137
02:22:06,336 --> 02:22:07,921
is exceptionally dangerous.

2138
02:22:08,797 --> 02:22:11,341
Take a look at the man
beside you.

2139
02:22:11,466 --> 02:22:13,927
It's a good bet
that in the next six weeks...

2140
02:22:14,052 --> 02:22:17,221
you or he...

2141
02:22:17,305 --> 02:22:18,472
will be dead.

2142
02:22:21,683 --> 02:22:24,228
Everyone brave enough
to accept this...

2143
02:22:25,646 --> 02:22:27,314
step forward.

2144
02:22:35,363 --> 02:22:37,240
Your grandmother
could take a B-25 off...

2145
02:22:37,323 --> 02:22:39,700
on a mile-long runway.

2146
02:22:39,825 --> 02:22:44,663
Well, I'm gonna train you
to do it in 467 feet.

2147
02:22:44,715 --> 02:22:48,250
Because at 468 feet...

2148
02:22:48,333 --> 02:22:50,253
you're dead.

2149
02:22:50,378 --> 02:22:51,492
And once you get it up...

2150
02:22:51,544 --> 02:22:54,340
you'll learn to fly it
like a fighter...

2151
02:22:54,381 --> 02:22:56,549
thirty feet off the ground.

2152
02:22:56,632 --> 02:22:57,842
I want you to say hello...

2153
02:22:57,968 --> 02:23:00,344
to Lieutenant Jack Richards,
Navy Aviation.

2154
02:23:00,386 --> 02:23:02,555
He'll help us
lighten these fat ladies.

2155
02:23:02,639 --> 02:23:03,681
Dump that ash can.

2156
02:23:03,733 --> 02:23:04,723
Dump that ash can.

2157
02:23:04,848 --> 02:23:07,143
See that bomb sight?
Get rid of it.

2158
02:23:07,268 --> 02:23:08,800
Colonel, he's crazy!

2159
02:23:08,852 --> 02:23:10,854
- The lady's fat!
- Listen to him.

2160
02:23:10,906 --> 02:23:12,856
She's fat.
We want a skinny lady!

2161
02:23:18,028 --> 02:23:19,696
Max power!

2162
02:23:22,574 --> 02:23:23,867
Get up, get up!

2163
02:23:24,700 --> 02:23:26,160
- Damn!
- How the heck-

2164
02:23:26,286 --> 02:23:27,578
Damn!

2165
02:23:35,461 --> 02:23:37,170
DOOLITTLE: They just keep
rolling past that line.

2166
02:23:37,295 --> 02:23:38,662
RlCHARDS:
Maybe it's a bad idea.

2167
02:23:38,714 --> 02:23:41,340
No, they're too heavy.
We gotta get drastic.

2168
02:23:41,465 --> 02:23:43,009
This armored plating goes.

2169
02:23:43,134 --> 02:23:45,886
I'm sure, I'm sure.
Lose it like a skirt, son.

2170
02:23:46,011 --> 02:23:47,472
Release brakes!

2171
02:23:49,598 --> 02:23:51,017
Come on, come on!

2172
02:23:52,977 --> 02:23:56,897
- God!
- Put every man on the line!

2173
02:23:59,483 --> 02:24:01,610
Let's show these boys
how this thing is done!

2174
02:24:03,737 --> 02:24:05,613
Come on! Max power.

2175
02:24:08,449 --> 02:24:10,566
[Cheering]

2176
02:24:10,618 --> 02:24:12,787
Well, if he can do it...

2177
02:24:17,499 --> 02:24:19,376
[Laughs]

2178
02:24:29,927 --> 02:24:31,929
DOOLITTLE: Well, gentlemen,
now I can tell you...

2179
02:24:31,971 --> 02:24:33,806
that we're going to Tokyo.

2180
02:24:35,642 --> 02:24:37,226
And we're gonna bomb it.

2181
02:24:37,309 --> 02:24:39,687
[Cheering]

2182
02:24:43,232 --> 02:24:44,941
That comes
as a special request...

2183
02:24:45,066 --> 02:24:47,361
directly from
President Roosevelt.

2184
02:24:47,403 --> 02:24:50,822
The Navy'll sneak us about
400 miles off the coast...

2185
02:24:50,948 --> 02:24:52,240
and we'll launch
from the carrier there.

2186
02:24:52,324 --> 02:24:53,824
Has that been done before?

2187
02:24:54,951 --> 02:24:56,411
Taking Army bombers
off Navy carriers?

2188
02:24:56,536 --> 02:24:59,664
- No.
- OK.

2189
02:24:59,706 --> 02:25:01,414
Any other questions?

2190
02:25:01,540 --> 02:25:03,542
Well, sir, is it even
possible to land...

2191
02:25:03,626 --> 02:25:05,793
a B-25
on an aircraft carrier deck?

2192
02:25:05,835 --> 02:25:07,671
That won't matter.

2193
02:25:07,796 --> 02:25:11,008
As soon as we're airborne,
the carrier heads for Hawaii.

2194
02:25:11,133 --> 02:25:13,260
But without them,
where do we land?

2195
02:25:13,384 --> 02:25:16,137
I have a phrase
I want you to memorize.

2196
02:25:17,679 --> 02:25:20,798
Wo shimeiguo ren.

2197
02:25:20,850 --> 02:25:23,144
It means "I am an American".

2198
02:25:24,687 --> 02:25:26,647
In Chinese.

2199
02:25:27,731 --> 02:25:29,274
Ain't gonna be any easier.

2200
02:25:29,399 --> 02:25:31,985
That's three feet shorter
than our practice runway.

2201
02:25:32,110 --> 02:25:35,030
- Fellas?
- Sir.

2202
02:25:35,155 --> 02:25:36,281
Sir.

2203
02:25:38,283 --> 02:25:39,992
Secretary of the Navy
gave me these.

2204
02:25:41,577 --> 02:25:42,818
What are they?

2205
02:25:42,870 --> 02:25:44,705
Friendship medals
the Japanese gave us...

2206
02:25:44,872 --> 02:25:46,415
when they were pretending
to want peace.

2207
02:25:46,582 --> 02:25:47,875
What'll you do with them?

2208
02:25:47,958 --> 02:25:50,460
Wire them to the bombs
and give them back.

2209
02:25:53,713 --> 02:25:55,830
So what's going on?

2210
02:25:55,882 --> 02:25:57,884
Well, sir,
we only have sixteen planes.

2211
02:25:58,009 --> 02:25:59,178
So?

2212
02:25:59,303 --> 02:26:02,597
When the Japs hit us,
they had more than 300.

2213
02:26:02,638 --> 02:26:04,765
How much difference
can we make?

2214
02:26:04,890 --> 02:26:06,642
It's not that we're afraid,
sir.

2215
02:26:06,726 --> 02:26:10,187
But we might die, and
we want to know what it's for.

2216
02:26:13,356 --> 02:26:16,193
You know, at Pearl,
they hit us with a sledgehammer.

2217
02:26:18,069 --> 02:26:21,322
This raid,
even if we make it through...

2218
02:26:21,364 --> 02:26:24,617
it'll only be a pin prick...

2219
02:26:24,742 --> 02:26:26,493
but it'll be straight
through their hearts.

2220
02:26:27,912 --> 02:26:31,374
Victory belongs to those
that believe in it the most...

2221
02:26:31,499 --> 02:26:32,999
and believe in it the longest.

2222
02:26:34,668 --> 02:26:37,212
We're gonna believe.

2223
02:26:37,295 --> 02:26:39,463
We're gonna make
America believe, too.

2224
02:26:39,515 --> 02:26:41,632
RlCHARDS:
Colonel? I need a minute.

2225
02:26:44,094 --> 02:26:46,930
- Excuse me, Major Jackson?
- Yes?

2226
02:26:46,972 --> 02:26:48,098
Do you remember me?

2227
02:26:49,516 --> 02:26:51,173
Oh, sure I do.

2228
02:26:51,225 --> 02:26:53,644
I'm sorry.
I've been meaning to thank you.

2229
02:26:53,686 --> 02:26:55,229
Well, maybe you can.

2230
02:26:55,354 --> 02:26:58,606
When the news comes in
about the Doolittle boys...

2231
02:26:58,648 --> 02:27:00,234
I want to be
in the command post.

2232
02:27:01,318 --> 02:27:03,779
I'm sorry. I don't know
what you're talking about.

2233
02:27:06,364 --> 02:27:08,366
How the hell
do you know about this mission?

2234
02:27:09,617 --> 02:27:11,536
Let's call it
an inadvertent disclosure.

2235
02:27:11,619 --> 02:27:13,955
Some flyboy you're dating
shot his mouth off.

2236
02:27:15,289 --> 02:27:17,249
Actually,
it's about two pilots.

2237
02:27:17,291 --> 02:27:20,492
I know they're going
into great danger.

2238
02:27:20,544 --> 02:27:22,838
I just want to be there
when the news tells us...

2239
02:27:22,963 --> 02:27:24,089
if they've lived or died.

2240
02:27:28,384 --> 02:27:30,845
Most officers would have
thrown you in the brig.

2241
02:27:30,897 --> 02:27:33,556
Most nurses
wouldn't keep their fingers...

2242
02:27:33,639 --> 02:27:34,974
plugged in your artery.

2243
02:27:40,729 --> 02:27:42,439
I can't promise you anything.

2244
02:27:49,154 --> 02:27:51,865
GOOZ: Hey, Red,
you think they picked us...

2245
02:27:51,990 --> 02:27:54,575
to do this
'cause we're young and dumb?

2246
02:27:55,952 --> 02:27:58,454
Come on, Gooz,
we're the tip of the sword.

2247
02:28:15,595 --> 02:28:17,180
In honor of our trip to Japan...

2248
02:28:17,305 --> 02:28:20,308
I got us some victory cigars!

2249
02:28:20,350 --> 02:28:23,133
- Yeah!
- There you go.

2250
02:28:23,185 --> 02:28:25,479
Put that in your insidepocket,
next to your heart.

2251
02:28:25,531 --> 02:28:27,314
You know, Jack,
we may lose this battle...

2252
02:28:27,366 --> 02:28:29,984
but we're gonna win this war.

2253
02:28:30,067 --> 02:28:32,486
- You know how I know?
- No.

2254
02:28:34,488 --> 02:28:35,489
Them.

2255
02:28:36,740 --> 02:28:38,199
DOOLITTLE:
'Cause they're rare.

2256
02:28:39,492 --> 02:28:41,911
And at times like these,
you see them...

2257
02:28:43,788 --> 02:28:45,039
stepping forward.

2258
02:28:46,916 --> 02:28:50,085
There's nothing stronger than
the heart of a volunteer, Jack.

2259
02:28:55,799 --> 02:28:56,925
My friends
in the war department...

2260
02:28:57,050 --> 02:28:59,344
don't want me
to lead this raid...

2261
02:28:59,512 --> 02:29:02,639
because they say
I'm too valuable.

Colonel, you've given us
homing beacons...

2274
02:29:41,841 --> 02:29:44,720
but you said China is
overrun with Japanese troops.

2275

over Japan?

Well, in that situation,
I can't tell you what to do.

I wasn't built
to be a prisoner...

2282
02:30:05,584 --> 02:30:08,420
so I would have
my crew bail out.

2283
02:30:08,545 --> 02:30:11,171
I'd find the sweetest
military target I could...

2284
02:30:11,296 --> 02:30:13,422
and drive my plane right
smack into the middle of it...

2285

this plane apart!

Get up in that soup!

2442
02:40:04,782 --> 02:40:07,201
We're gonna pull out of this,

Thank you, George.

2444
02:40:26,589 --> 02:40:27,965
What is it, General?

2445
02:40:28,048 --> 02:40:31,050
Colonel Doolittle had to
advance his execution order...

2446
02:40:31,092 --> 02:40:32,802
by twelve hours, Mr. President.

2447
02:40:32,927 --> 02:40:34,636
There will be no homing beacons.

2448

The plane carrying them
crashed en route to China...

2449
02:40:37,397 --> 02:40:38,805
and our bombers
may lack the fuel...

to reach the mainland, sir.

2451
02:40:40,682 --> 02:40:46,227

on empty tanks.

getting a signal.

02:41:07,658 --> 02:41:09,701
How many cans of fuel
we got left?

2457
02:41:09,827 --> 02:41:11,661
These are all empty!

2459
02:41:14,413 --> 02:41:15,955

the privilege of flying with.

2465

But we're on our own.

02:41:42,974 --> 02:41:45,725

- I am. How about now?

We can make this.
I can see the coast now.

We're only a few miles out.

2478
02:42:25,336 --> 02:42:28,004
We gotta find
a soft landing spot.

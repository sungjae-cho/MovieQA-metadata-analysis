San Francisco. California

00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:54,520
-You ready?
-Yeah. Let's go.

6
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:04,880
-ls that what I think it is?
-l think so.

7
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,960
-You nervous?
-As long as they spelled my name right.

8
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:22,960
-You want a moment alone with it?
-l want you right here with me.

9
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,760
There it is.

10
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,520
There it is.

11
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,760
Your baby.

12
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,400
I'll get it.

13
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,120
Hello?

14
00:03:55,879 --> 00:03:57,520
Hello?

15
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,640
Amir ian.

16
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,200
Rahim Khan?

17
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:06,040
lt is kind of you to remember.

18
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:13,960
I have missed you, Amirian.

19
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,880
It's good to hear your voice.

20
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:19,200
You should come home.

21
00:04:20,199 --> 00:04:21,240
Home?

22
00:04:24,199 --> 00:04:26,280
I don't know if now's such a good time.

23
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,520
It's a vey bad time,
but you should come.

24
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,800
There is a way to be good again, Amir.

25
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:46,840
Kabul. Afghanistan
1 978

26
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:58,040
Take the spool. Hold it right.

27
00:05:10,279 --> 00:05:11,480
Give me string!

28
00:05:12,439 --> 00:05:13,880
Hold the spool right.

29
00:05:22,519 --> 00:05:24,680
-l cut him!
-Victoy!

30
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,560
Victoy!

31
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:30,160
This way!

32
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,840
Where are you going?

33
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:34,960
Catch it. it's going this way!

34
00:05:47,959 --> 00:05:49,400
We're losing it!

35
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,560
Trust me!

36
00:06:19,399 --> 00:06:20,560
What are you doing here?

37
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:23,200
Come sit. Amir.

38
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,480
You're wasting time here.

39
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:29,880
The kite went the other way.

40
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,600
lt will come this way.

41
00:06:32,519 --> 00:06:34,080
-How do you know?
-l know.

42
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,280
But how?

43
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,360
Have I ever lied to you?

44
00:06:38,279 --> 00:06:39,600
How should I know?

45
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,400
I'd rather eat dirt.

46
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:44,880
Would you really do that?

47
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,640
-Do what?
-Eat dirt if I told you to.

48
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,800
lf you asked. I would.

49
00:06:53,879 --> 00:06:55,800
But would you really ask me to do
such a thing?

50
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,560
Are you crazy?

51
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,040
You know I wouldn't.

52
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:01,120
I know.

54
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,600
Thank you. Agha sahib.

55
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:27,200
I want them
to start building tomorrow.

56
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,280
This should have happened a
Iong time ago.

57
00:07:30,519 --> 00:07:33,040
Absolutely. Sahib!
And thank you.

58
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:36,400
The orphans of Kabul
will never forget you.

59
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,480
Somehow

60
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:42,720
I suspect they will.

61
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,840
You know

62
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:51,440
the bureaucrats
will steal half the money.

63
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,200
Only half?

64
00:07:54,759 --> 00:07:56,800
They've gotten lazy.

65
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,400
Hey, Mister Jaylawni

66
00:08:02,519 --> 00:08:04,720
Coniure up the winds for me

67
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:07,200
You could have beaten him.

68
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:10,240
Me? Weren't you
watching Omar back there?

69
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:11,600
He never loses.

70
00:08:11,839 --> 00:08:15,560
lf you have the right kite.
you'll win the tournament this year.

71
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,440
With the victoy of Saur Revolution

72
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:23,040
for the first time
in the histoy of this county

73
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:27,120
the political sovereignty
and political power have _n bestDwed

74
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:31,280
upon the Democratic Party
of the People of Afghanistan.

75
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:36,280
This will get bloody
before it gets better.

76
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:38,400
Usually a safe bet.

77
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:44,080
They say the Communists are
starting brawls at the university.

78
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:48,480
A student was stabbed last week.

79
00:08:49,559 --> 00:08:52,800
I'm glad Amir's too young
to be involved in all this.

80
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:54,760
Amir?

81
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:59,600
Trust me. he won't be
getting into any brawls.

82
00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:03,920
Sometimes I see him playing on the
street with the neighbourhood boys.

83
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:09,840
They push him around.
take his toys from him.

84
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,200
but Amir.

85
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:14,000
he never fights back. Never.

86
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:15,960
So he's not violent.

87
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,720
You know what happens
when the other kids tease him?

88
00:09:19,799 --> 00:09:22,160
Hassan steps in and fends them off.

89
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,920
And when they come home.
I say to him.

90
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:27,000
''How did Hassan
get that scrape on his face?''

91
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,560
He says. ''He fell down.''

92
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,440
There's something missing in that boy.

93
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,320
My friend.

94
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,480
children aren't colouring books.

95
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,680
You don't get to fill them
with your favourite colours.

96
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:45,840
He's not like you.
He'll never be like you.

97
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,920
But watch. He'll turn out well.

98
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,240
A boy who won't stand up for himself.

99
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:55,160
becomes a man who
won't stand up for anything.

100
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,480
Amir ian.

101
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,080
may I come in?

102
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:22,920
I wanted to say goodbye.

103
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:25,040
I'm going to Pakistan tomorrow.

104
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,600
That's a fine kite.

105
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,200
Hassan ran it down.

106
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,080
The boy's got a gift.

107
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:41,120
What are you working on?

108
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,600
A stoy.

109
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:44,920
May I read it?

110
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:47,280
It's not vey good.

111
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:51,920
All the same. I'd love to read it.

112
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,720
Thank you. Amir ian.

113
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,760
I'll read it tonight.

114
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:01,840
He hates me

115
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,400
because I killed her.

116
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,200
My mother.

117
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,000
Amir.

118
00:11:12,759 --> 00:11:14,600
don't ever say such a thing.

119
00:11:15,559 --> 00:11:17,120
Don't ever think it.

120
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,760
But it's true.

121
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,520
No. Amir ian.

122
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:30,840
It's a dangerous thing. being born.

123
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:34,200
Dangerous for the mother.

124
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,480
dangerous for the child.

125
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:42,000
Your father would die for you.

126
00:11:42,799 --> 00:11:44,480
You know that.

127
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:49,040
don't you?

128
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,280
Amir ian.

129
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,320
-Come on. do it.
-It's wrong. Amir agha.

130
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:04,520
Do you have to be
so holy all the time?

131
00:12:05,639 --> 00:12:06,640
Just one?

132
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,360
Just one.

133
00:12:20,919 --> 00:12:23,240
You'd think one day he'd wise up.

134
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,320
You got your allowance?

135
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,720
Yeah. how about we see
rhe Magnificent Seyen again?

136
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,280
We deal in lead. friend!

137
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,680
I'm a friend of Hary Luck's.
He tells me you're broke.

138
00:12:43,799 --> 00:12:46,360
No. I'm doing this because
I'm an eccentric millionaire.

139
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,320
There's a iob for six men

140
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,880
watching over a village
iust south of the border.

141
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,560
How big's the opposition?

142
00:12:54,799 --> 00:12:56,160
Thirty guns.

143
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,760
I admire your notion of fair odds. mister.

144
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:02,320
I admire your notion of fair odds, mister.

145
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:06,600
Hary tells me you faced bigger odds
in the Travis County War.

146
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:16,320
-Who's your favourite?
-Steve McQueen.

147
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:19,480
I like Charles Bronson.
Maybe someday we'll go to Iran.

148
00:13:19,639 --> 00:13:20,680
Why?

149
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:22,320
Maybe we'd see him somewhere.

150
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,600
I could get his autograph.

151
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,880
-Charles Bronson's not Iranian.
-He's not?

152
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,560
So why does he speak Farsi
with an Iranian accent?

153
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,880
Where are you going. faggots?

154
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,040
What do you boys think:

155
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,720
lf I paid you to be my friends.

156
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:41,160
would you really be my friends?
Or would you be my servants?

157
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,560
Gee. Assef.
if you were paying us.

158
00:13:44,279 --> 00:13:45,720
that would make us your servants!

159
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,440
So I guess Amir has no friends.

160
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:50,880
We're not bothering you.

161
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,080
Wrong.

162
00:13:52,519 --> 00:13:53,720
You are bothering me.

163
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,600
Afghanistan is the land of the Pashtuns.

164
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,120
We're the real Afghans.

165
00:13:58,679 --> 00:14:00,120
Not this flat-nose Hazara.

166
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:03,600
His people pollute our homeland.
They dirty our blood.

167
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:06,200
lf idiots like you and your father

168
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:10,200
didn't take these people in.
we'd be rid of them.

169
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,760
Please leave us alone. Agha.

170
00:14:16,279 --> 00:14:18,160
Put it down. you motherless Hazara.

171
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:20,840
Leave us in peace.

172
00:14:21,639 --> 00:14:22,920
Maybe you didn't notice.

173
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:25,160
but there are three of us.
and two of you.

174
00:14:25,559 --> 00:14:28,920
And maybe you didn't notice
that I'm the one holding the slingshot.

175
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,080
Forget it.

176
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,320
We'll deal with these faggots later.

177
00:14:45,639 --> 00:14:48,040
-What's this?
-Rahim Khan left it for you.

178
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,640
He liked it.

179
00:14:54,759 --> 00:14:55,960
Liked what?

180
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,640
My stoy!

181
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:02,480
Well of course he liked it.
You tell great stories.

182
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,720
''Bravo '' he wrote. Bravo!

183
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,320
Bravo?

184
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,760
Do you know what ''bravo'' means?

185
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,480
It's Italian for genius.

186
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:13,720
What's the stoy about?

187
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:17,240
It's about a man
who finds a magic cup.

188
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,800
And he learns that
if he weeps into the cup.

189
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:21,520
his tears turn to pearls.

190
00:15:21,919 --> 00:15:24,080
He's vey poor. you know?

191
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,840
And. at the end of the stoy.
he's sitting on a mountain of pearls

192
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:30,360
with a bloody knife in his hand
and his dead wife in his arms.

193
00:15:31,879 --> 00:15:34,360
-So he killed her?
-Yes. Hassan.

194
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:38,040
So that he'd cy and get rich.

195
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:40,600
Yes. you're vey quick.

196
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,360
What?

197
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:45,400
Nothing. Amir agha.
Are you done with breaMast?

198
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:47,000
What?

199
00:15:47,559 --> 00:15:51,000
Well. will you permit me
to ask a question about the stoy?

200
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,600
Of course.

201
00:15:53,039 --> 00:15:55,480
Why did the man have to kill his wife?

202
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:59,400
Because each of his tears
becomes a pearl.

203
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:03,640
Yes. but why couldn't he
just smell an onion?

205
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,960
The mullahs at school
say drinking is a sin.

206
00:16:22,919 --> 00:16:25,440
They say drinkers will pay
when the Reckoning comes.

207
00:16:25,879 --> 00:16:28,280
Do you want to know
what your father thinks about sin?

208
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:29,720
Yes.

209
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,480
Then I'll tell you.

210
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,480
But first understand this
and understand it now:

211
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,720
You'll never learn anything of value
from those bearded idiots.

212
00:16:38,799 --> 00:16:40,280
You mean the mullahs?

213
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:42,840
I piss on the beards of those
self-righteous monkeys.

214
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:46,360
They do nothing but thumb their prayer
beads and recite a book

215
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:49,600
written in a tongue
they don't even understand.

216
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:52,760
There is only one sin.
And that is theft.

217
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,920
Evey other sin is a variation of theft.
Do you understand that?

218
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,640
No. Baba ian.

219
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:02,280
When you kill a man.

220
00:17:02,799 --> 00:17:04,760
you steal a life.

221
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:07,880
You steal his wife's right
to her husband.

222
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,600
his children's right to a father.

223
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:14,960
When you tell a lie.
you steal someone's right to the truth.

224
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:19,480
There is no act
more wretched than stealing.

225
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,440
Do you see?

226
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,040
Yes. Baba.

227
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:28,040
Good.

228
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:30,680
All this talk of sinning
is making me thirsty.

229
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,840
Hassan! Hassan!

230
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:42,200
Go. he's calling you.

231
00:17:46,759 --> 00:17:48,120
Happy Birthday.

232
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,280
It's made in America.

233
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:55,480
I figured. if you're
going to be my bodyguard.

234
00:17:55,599 --> 00:17:57,000
you need a proper weapon.

235
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,320
Thank you. Amir agha.

236
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,160
Come on. Iet's go.

237
00:18:25,079 --> 00:18:26,240
What does it say?

238
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,760
Amir and Hassan.
the Sultans of Kabul.

239
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:32,160
The Sultans of Kabul!

240
00:18:32,839 --> 00:18:34,400
You want a stoy?

241
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,480
Rostam and Sohrab.

242
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,400
Not them again.
I've read you that one fifty times.

243
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:42,400
How about Rudabeh?

244
00:18:43,359 --> 00:18:45,240
It's your book. Amir agha.

245
00:18:47,519 --> 00:18:48,600
All right.

246
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:52,280
Rostam and Sohrab.
It's your birthday.

247
00:19:20,519 --> 00:19:22,560
Your dad got a new car?

248
00:19:23,119 --> 00:19:25,240
lsn't that the car they drive in Bullitt?

249
00:19:27,759 --> 00:19:28,800
Steve McQueen!

250
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,280
I heard it was someone's birthday.

251
00:19:34,839 --> 00:19:37,280
It's your day. Hassan.
Why don't you sit up front?

252
00:19:39,559 --> 00:19:41,120
Are you ready for your birthday present?

253
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,200
-ls it a drawing book?
-Better!

254
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:45,160
-A toy gun?
-Better!

255
00:20:20,759 --> 00:20:22,040
Uncle Saifo!

256
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:25,280
My brother!
It's been too long.

257
00:20:26,039 --> 00:20:27,360
Eveyone good?

258
00:20:29,839 --> 00:20:32,000
It's his birthday. he can have any
kite he wants.

259
00:20:33,519 --> 00:20:35,520
Here they are.

260
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:38,600
Take your pick.

261
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,760
I want that one.

262
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:56,920
We'll take it.

263
00:20:57,839 --> 00:20:58,880
A good choice.

264
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,760
I was iust lucky that time.

265
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:04,920
lt wasn't luck. Amir agha.
You're better than him.

266
00:21:09,839 --> 00:21:11,720
I know you're going to win.

267
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:15,320
You have too much faith in me.

268
00:21:16,519 --> 00:21:18,520
Ali made the cauliflower
especially for you.

269
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,640
Yes. Evey time I come.
he makes the cauliflower.

270
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:23,080
I know. You come here too often.

271
00:21:25,519 --> 00:21:26,880
The tournament's tomorrow?

272
00:21:27,279 --> 00:21:29,040
Are you and Hassan ready?

273
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:30,800
We've been practising.

274
00:21:31,279 --> 00:21:34,720
Did I ever tell you
about the year I won?

275
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:38,840
I'm fairly sure you told eveyone
in Kabul about the year you won.

276
00:21:39,599 --> 00:21:41,760
Fourteen kites I cut down.

277
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:44,160
I think that's still a record.

278
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,400
Yes. yes. yes. Eat.

279
00:22:28,079 --> 00:22:30,320
I think you're going to make
Agha sahib vey proud today.

280
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,840
You think so?

281
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:32,960
lnshallah.

282
00:22:33,079 --> 00:22:34,160
lnshallah.

284
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,640
It's really crowded.

285
00:23:00,759 --> 00:23:02,600
I'm not sure it's
the best day to fly a kite.

286
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:03,880
Why?

287
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,280
It's a beautiful day.

288
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,720
It's the two of us
against all of Kabul.

289
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,800
I admire your notion of fair odds. mister.

290
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:15,960
Let's fly.

291
00:23:25,599 --> 00:23:27,000
Put down the spool.

292
00:23:27,359 --> 00:23:29,000
Take it!

293
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:18,240
Take it from under.

294
00:24:23,519 --> 00:24:24,520
Okay. I'm under.

295
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:43,800
We cut him! We cut him!

296
00:25:08,359 --> 00:25:09,680
Amir agha!

297
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,520
Go a little to your right.

298
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:41,040
We cut him! We cut him!

299
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:42,800
They could break your record.

300
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,240
Let's see.

301
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:55,640
Hold the spool right.

302
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:02,720
Take him. Omar!

303
00:26:04,359 --> 00:26:07,680
Omar! Omar! Omar!

304
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,480
Omar!

305
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,440
I cut him!

306
00:26:30,599 --> 00:26:33,120
Victoy! Victoy!

307
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:41,680
-How many has he cut?
-I've counted twelve.

308
00:26:42,319 --> 00:26:44,760
I think he wants Baba's record.

309
00:26:45,079 --> 00:26:47,280
We can't let that happen.

310
00:26:54,599 --> 00:26:56,760
Last one. Omar agha.

311
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:16,840
Pull your string forward.

312
00:27:17,799 --> 00:27:18,840
Cut him!

313
00:27:30,279 --> 00:27:32,560
It's iust the two of them now.

314
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:45,800
Bravo. Amir agha!

315
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,040
You cut him!

316
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:50,160
We won! We won!

317
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:01,360
Amir. I'm going to run
that blue kite for you.

318
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:03,520
Hassan! Come back with it!

319
00:28:04,039 --> 00:28:06,160
For you. a thousand times over!

320
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:25,160
What am I supposed to do with this?
You're the reason I got cut!

321
00:28:48,759 --> 00:28:51,440
Have you seen
a Hazara boy come this way?

322
00:28:51,559 --> 00:28:53,000
Wearing a red chapan.

323
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:56,880
I saw a boy running that way.
He had a kite in his hand.

324
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:01,320
-They've probably caught him by now.
-Who?

325
00:29:01,759 --> 00:29:04,120
The big boys chasing him.

327
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:28,640
Where's your slingshot. Hazara?

328
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:32,200
You don't look so brave today.

329
00:29:33,759 --> 00:29:37,240
But I'm in a mood to forgive.
What do you say to that. boys?

330
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:39,520
Vey generous.

331
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:42,000
Especially after the
rude manners he showed last time.

332
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,880
Forgiven. It's done.

333
00:29:48,279 --> 00:29:50,760
Of course. nothing is free in this world.

334
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,520
My pardon comes with a small price.

335
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,520
Nothing is free.

336
00:29:55,079 --> 00:29:56,720
You're a lucky Hazara.

337
00:29:57,039 --> 00:30:00,360
Because. today. it's only
going to cost you that kite.

338
00:30:02,279 --> 00:30:03,520
Fair deal.

339
00:30:03,799 --> 00:30:07,680
-What do you think. boys?
-More than fair.

340
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:12,880
Amir agha won the tournament
and I ran this kite for him.

341
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:15,280
This is his.

342
00:30:16,359 --> 00:30:17,440
Loyal Hazara.

343
00:30:17,799 --> 00:30:18,960
Loyal dog.

344
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:23,960
Before you sacrifice yourself for him.
think about this. Hazara:

345
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:26,640
Would he do the same for you?

346
00:30:26,839 --> 00:30:28,080
Have you ever wondered why

347
00:30:28,279 --> 00:30:30,320
he only plays with you
when no one else is around?

348
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:34,000
I said. ''Why '' Hazara!

349
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:38,120
Because. to him.
you're nothing but an ugly pet.

350
00:30:38,599 --> 00:30:40,600
Something he can play with
when he's bored.

351
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,920
Something he can kick
when he's angy.

352
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,760
Amir agha and I are friends.

353
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:45,840
Friends?

354
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:46,960
You fool. Enough of this.

355
00:30:47,079 --> 00:30:48,160
Give us the kite.

356
00:30:50,079 --> 00:30:51,480
Last chance.

357
00:30:53,559 --> 00:30:55,120
As you wish.

358
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:57,640
Keep it.

359
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:02,120
So it will always remind you
of what I'm about to do to you.

360
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:03,280
Nothing is free.

361
00:31:16,119 --> 00:31:18,000
He's iust a servant's son.

362
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,680
I'm not sure. Assef.
My father says it's wrong.

363
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,320
Your father's a Communist.

364
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:26,320
And there's nothing wrong
about teaching this donkey a lesson.

365
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:29,200
Just hold him down.

366
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,240
Let's get out of here.

367
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:33,720
Where were you?
I was looking for you.

368
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:35,240
Let's go. Agha sahib will wory.

369
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:53,160
Good iob.

370
00:32:55,759 --> 00:32:56,760
Come here.

371
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:07,880
Well done.

372
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:34,120
Where's Hassan?

373
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:35,240
He went back to sleep.

374
00:33:35,559 --> 00:33:38,680
The last few weeks.
all he wants to do is sleep.

375
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:40,680
After chores he iust
crawls under his blanket.

376
00:33:42,079 --> 00:33:43,680
Can I ask you something?

377
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,720
Did something happen. Amir agha?

378
00:33:48,279 --> 00:33:50,080
Something he's not telling me?

379
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:53,200
How should I know?
Maybe he's sick.

380
00:33:53,759 --> 00:33:55,640
People get sick. you know.

381
00:34:09,639 --> 00:34:11,920
The mullahs want to rule our souls

382
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:15,800
and the Communists
tell us we don't have any.

383
00:34:16,559 --> 00:34:19,840
More importantly. El Cid is playing.
We could go tomorrow.

384
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:22,520
Tell Hassan to come with us?

385
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,080
He's not feeling well.

386
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:27,840
Really? What's wrong with him?

387
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:29,960
He's got a cold or something.

388
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:32,920
Ali says he's sleeping it off.

389
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,320
I haven't seen you two
playing together in weeks.

390
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:36,760
What happened?

391
00:34:38,599 --> 00:34:40,840
Nothing. He's iust been a little sick.

392
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:42,720
Hassan never gets sick.

393
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:45,360
Whatever's going on. you should
deal with it before too long.

394
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,600
Take care not to
Iet these things fester.

395
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:50,080
Time will only make it worse.

396
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,720
What are you reading?

397
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:14,920
It's for little kids.
I just... I'm tying to learn.

398
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:19,720
I'd rather hear one of your stories.

399
00:35:20,719 --> 00:35:22,200
I'm done making up stories.

400
00:35:22,679 --> 00:35:23,680
Why?

401
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:25,880
Because they're stupid.

402
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:29,680
I don't think they're stupid.
I love your stories.

403
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:34,160
What would you do
if I hit you with this?

404
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:38,960
What would you do?

405
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:41,800
Hit me back!

406
00:35:43,639 --> 00:35:44,640
Hit me back!

407
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:46,440
Hit me back!

408
00:35:47,159 --> 00:35:48,320
Hit me back.

409
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,040
You're a coward.

411
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:17,040
Blood's good for the trees.

412
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:19,800
Come on. birthday boy.
Let's go inside.

413
00:36:21,559 --> 00:36:23,200
Ali. is eveything ready?

414
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:26,080
Don't wory. it will be soon.

415
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:31,320
-Move it back a little.
-Yes. of course.

416
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:44,360
Have you ever thought
about getting new servants?

417
00:36:51,159 --> 00:36:52,720
Why would I want to do that?

418
00:36:53,239 --> 00:36:56,520
I guess you wouldn't.
It was just a question.

419
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:58,920
I grew up with Ali.

420
00:36:59,039 --> 00:37:02,960
My father took him in.
Ioved him like his own son.

421
00:37:04,559 --> 00:37:07,080
Forty years he's been with my family.
Forty goddamn years.

422
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:11,880
And you think I'm iust
going to throw him out?

423
00:37:13,519 --> 00:37:16,600
I've never laid a hand on you.

424
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:19,440
but you ever say that again...

425
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:22,920
You bring me shame.

426
00:37:23,519 --> 00:37:25,120
And. Hassan...

427
00:37:26,159 --> 00:37:28,120
Hassan's not going an_here.

428
00:37:28,239 --> 00:37:29,400
Do you understand?

429
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:34,600
I said. do you understand?

430
00:37:35,639 --> 00:37:36,920
Yes. Baba.

431
00:37:40,599 --> 00:37:42,960
You bring me shame.

432
00:38:28,199 --> 00:38:30,760
Massoud ian. how are you?

433
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:32,560
-Welcome.
-Happy birthday.

434
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,440
Welcome.

435
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:40,560
Hello. Amir ian. Happy birthday.

436
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,440
Hello. Amir ian. How are you?

437
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:50,160
lt is modest and not worthy of you.

438
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:52,000
Happy birthday.

439
00:38:53,519 --> 00:38:56,360
Hassan said your copy was
getting old. missing some pages.

440
00:38:57,199 --> 00:38:58,680
Thank you.

441
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:00,400
Amir.

442
00:39:00,519 --> 00:39:02,320
Happy birthday. Amir ian.

443
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:07,120
Happy birthday.

444
00:39:07,639 --> 00:39:10,960
-What a splendid suit.
-Great party. Amir.

445
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:15,240
Aren't you going
to thank Assef?

446
00:39:17,199 --> 00:39:18,160
Thank you.

447
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:24,440
Please. enioy.

448
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:39,880
Amir ian.

449
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,240
Shouldn't you be
entertaining your guests?

450
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:49,280
I didn't know you drank.

451
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:52,200
Turns out I do.

452
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:55,840
But only on the most
important occasions.

453
00:39:58,679 --> 00:40:04,520
You know you can tell me
anything you want. Anytime.

454
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:06,960
I know.

455
00:40:09,199 --> 00:40:11,720
Here. I almost forgot.

456
00:40:13,679 --> 00:40:15,640
For your stories.

457
00:40:25,039 --> 00:40:27,960
Come. You're missing your party.

458
00:41:27,039 --> 00:41:28,080
Baba.

459
00:41:29,079 --> 00:41:30,600
Have you seen my watch an_here?

460
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:32,760
The one I iust bought you?

461
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:34,640
Don't tell me you already lost it.

462
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:38,120
No. I know I had it in my room.

463
00:41:38,639 --> 00:41:40,360
I'm sure it'll turn up somewhere.

464
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:23,400
What's wrong?

465
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:28,240
Ali.

466
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:30,280
When you finish your work.
come inside with Hassan.

467
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:31,880
Yes. Agha sahib.

469
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:41,800
Did you steal Amir's watch. Hassan?

470
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:49,920
Yes.

471
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:56,040
I forgive you.

472
00:42:58,639 --> 00:43:00,120
We're leaving. Agha sahib.

473
00:43:00,639 --> 00:43:01,720
What?

474
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:04,120
We can't live here any more.

475
00:43:05,079 --> 00:43:07,240
But I forgive him.
Didn't you hear me. Ali?

476
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:11,360
Life here is impossible
for us now. Agha sahib.

477
00:43:11,519 --> 00:43:12,680
We're leaving.

478
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:14,280
I don't care about the watch.

479
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:16,240
I don't understand
why you're doing this.

480
00:43:16,519 --> 00:43:19,800
I'm sory. Agha sahib.
but our bags are already packed.

481
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:22,280
We've made our decision.

482
00:43:22,519 --> 00:43:23,640
Ali.

483
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:25,320
Haven't I provided for you?

484
00:43:25,639 --> 00:43:27,040
Haven't I been good
to you and Hassan?

485
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:29,320
At least tell me why.

486
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:31,120
I forbid you to do this!

487
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:32,760
Do you hear me?

488
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:34,920
I forbid you!

489
00:43:37,679 --> 00:43:42,160
Respectfully. you can't
forbid me anything. Agha sahib.

490
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,640
We don't work for you any more.

491
00:44:19,599 --> 00:44:22,760
Soviet Invasion
December 1979

492
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:27,880
Pack a bag.
Only what you need.

493
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:28,960
Hury up!

494
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:33,960
-They'll come for me.
-We don't know that.

495
00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:37,560
Read your histoy. my friend. By the
time we know it. it will be too late.

496
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:44,440
You know how I am.
You know how I talk.

497
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:47,400
Eveyone in Kabul has
heard me cursing the Communists.

498
00:44:49,719 --> 00:44:53,400
Will you watch over the house for me?
We'll be back when the Russians leave.

499
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:55,640
What if they don't leave?

500
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:59,360
Eveyone leaves.
This county is not kind to invaders.

501
00:45:02,599 --> 00:45:04,040
And you. my friend?

502
00:45:04,599 --> 00:45:05,800
Where will you go?

503
00:45:06,639 --> 00:45:07,600
Pakistan. first.

504
00:45:08,079 --> 00:45:10,600
After that. wherever
is safest for the boy.

505
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:13,040
The smugglers want
five thousand a head

506
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:15,560
for safe passage to Pakistan.

507
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:18,400
I'm fairly sure they won't take cheques.

508
00:45:19,519 --> 00:45:21,640
What about a Mustang?

509
00:46:31,119 --> 00:46:34,840
He wants a half hour with
the lady in the back of the truck.

510
00:46:36,199 --> 00:46:37,160
What?

511
00:46:37,679 --> 00:46:38,680
No.

512
00:46:39,559 --> 00:46:40,720
Brother.

513
00:46:41,199 --> 00:46:43,000
Please ask mister soldier sahib
to show a little mercy.

514
00:46:43,639 --> 00:46:45,440
Maybe he has a wife. too.

515
00:46:46,159 --> 00:46:48,040
It's his price for letting us pass.

516
00:46:50,119 --> 00:46:52,120
I want you to ask
this man something.

517
00:46:52,239 --> 00:46:54,520
Ask him where his shame is.

518
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,920
He says.
there is no shame in war.

519
00:47:07,719 --> 00:47:11,200
Tell him he is wrong.
War doesn't negate decency.

520
00:47:15,679 --> 00:47:16,640
What did he say?

521
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:18,920
He says he'd enioy
putting a bullet in you.

522
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:21,040
almost as much as he'd enioy her.

523
00:47:22,079 --> 00:47:24,840
I'll take a thousand of his bullets
before I let this indecency take place.

524
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:27,920
-Baba. please. he'll shoot you.
-Have I taught you nothing?

525
00:47:28,719 --> 00:47:31,480
Tell him he'd better
kill me good with the first shot.

526
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:32,880
Because if I don't go down.

527
00:47:33,199 --> 00:47:35,080
I'm tearing him to pieces.
goddamn his father!

528
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:21,800
You are vey kind.

529
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:25,920
It's not worthy of a thank you.

530
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:52,160
Get out. Come on. get out.

531
00:48:52,679 --> 00:48:54,960
Keep it moving. Keep it moving.

532
00:48:56,079 --> 00:48:57,360
Why did you stop?

533
00:48:57,519 --> 00:48:59,720
We can't get you across
the border in that truck.

534
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:02,760
We don't have enough money
for all the Russians.

535
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:05,560
-So what are we doing?
-Go climb into that vehicle.

536
00:49:08,239 --> 00:49:09,760
You're ioking.

537
00:49:10,159 --> 00:49:11,920
Your choice. Agha sahib.

538
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:31,360
Climb up quickly.

539
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:39,040
Turn around and go down.

540
00:49:43,199 --> 00:49:45,120
I'm with you. Go.

541
00:49:54,639 --> 00:49:56,200
You see it?

542
00:49:56,559 --> 00:49:57,920
Yes.

543
00:49:58,320 --> 00:50:00,720
Don't be afraid.
I'm right here with you.

544
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:03,080
I can't breathe. Baba.

545
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:06,440
Think of something else.
Think of a poem.

00:54:39,719 --> 00:54:44,520
Well. people do need their stories
to divert them occasionally.

610
00:54:45,039 --> 00:54:48,800
-Father. you forgot your tea.
-You are too kind. my dear.

611

-You want a Coke?
-Sure. Be careful.

624
00:55:54,039 --> 00:55:55,080
Of what?

625
00:55:55,199 --> 00:55:58,480
The General is a Pashtun to the root.
He has honour and pride.

626
00:55:59,199 --> 00:56:01,080
I was only going to get us Cokes.

628
00:56:03,159 --> 00:56:04,760
That's all I ask.

633
00:56:25,039 --> 00:56:26,840
I will.

Have you read it?

641
00:56:54,159 --> 00:56:55,720
It's a sad stoy.

642
00:56:57,079 --> 00:56:58,640
I heard you write.

643
00:57:01,880 --> 00:57:04,320
Would you like to read
one of my stories?

644
00:57:07,119 --> 00:57:08,440
I'd like that.

645
00:57:11,119 --> 00:57:12,320

646
00:57:50,119 --> 00:57:52,760
-How much for this?

They say it will rain this week.

654
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:27,200
Hard to believe. isn't it?

655
00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:30,240
You know. child.

656
00:58:31,039 --> 00:58:32,640
I've grown rather fond of you.

657
00:58:33,960 --> 00:58:35,640
You're a decent boy.

658
00:58:36,119 --> 00:58:41,600
But. sometimes.
even decent boys need reminding.

659
00:58:42,159 --> 00:58:47,400
So it's my duty to remind you
that you are among peers.

660
00:58:48,519 --> 00:58:51,200
Here. eveyone is a stoyteller.

00:59:11,079 --> 00:59:12,240
Amir.

668
00:59:13,480 --> 00:59:14,840
What's wrong?

669
00:59:15,599 --> 00:59:16,760
Nothing.

670
00:59:18,039 --> 00:59:19,440
The General?

671
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:24,600

Have you been coughing?

674
00:59:32,199 --> 00:59:33,200
Yes.

675
00:59:34,559 --> 00:59:36,000
Where are you from?

676
00:59:36,119 --> 00:59:39,480
I grew up in Michigan.
Came out here for medical school.

677
00:59:39,599 --> 00:59:42,160
Once you get used to
that California sunshine...

678
00:59:42,280 --> 00:59:44,440
-But your family?
-My family.

679
00:59:44,559 --> 00:59:46,600
We're originally from Russia.

680
00:59:50,119 --> 00:59:51,280
I'm sory.

681
01:00:09,119 --> 01:00:11,440
-How are you feeling?
-The same.

682
01:00:12,679 --> 01:00:14,480
We have your results back.

683
01:00:19,320 --> 01:00:20,720
Wait outside for me.

685
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:41,800
~The citizens of Kabul
were skeletons now,

686
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:44,440
~skeletons selling naswar
in the night ma_et,

687
01:00:44,559 --> 01:00:47,040
~skeletons drinking cups of strong tea,

688
01:00:47,719 --> 01:00:50,160
''skeletons playing cards
in the moonlight.

689

''They greeted me as I passed.

690
01:00:57,119 --> 01:00:59,600
~'Salaam, brother#  they said.

691
01:01:01,320 --> 01:01:02,760
'''Welcome home.'''

692
01:01:09,320 --> 01:01:10,920
It's sort of a work in progress.

693
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:15,240
It's called rhe Sultans ofKabul.

694
01:01:16,360 --> 01:01:17,640
Good title.

695
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:20,760
Keep going.

696
01:01:22,280 --> 01:01:23,640
That's the end.

697
01:01:24,840 --> 01:01:26,480
That's not an ending.

698
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:29,880
It's my stoy.

699
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:31,960
I get to end it how I want.

700
01:01:36,440 --> 01:01:40,440
I'm tired of these machines.
Tomorrow I want you to take me home.

701
01:01:40,840 --> 01:01:42,120
But Dr Amani said...

702
01:01:42,239 --> 01:01:44,320
It's not Dr Amani's decision.

703
01:02:00,599 --> 01:02:02,400
How are you. my friend?

704
01:02:05,960 --> 01:02:08,680
You shouldn't
have burdened yourselves.

705
01:02:09,159 --> 01:02:10,160
It's no burden.

706
01:02:11,519 --> 01:02:13,520
No burden at all.

707
01:02:13,639 --> 01:02:17,880
lf you need anything.
ask me like you'd ask a brother.

708
01:02:19,400 --> 01:02:20,880
Your coming here

709
01:02:22,039 --> 01:02:23,920
has brightened my eyes.

710
01:02:25,119 --> 01:02:27,240
What about you. Amir ian?

711
01:02:27,480 --> 01:02:29,320
Do you need anything?

712
01:02:30,440 --> 01:02:33,200
No. thank you. General Sahib.

713
01:02:35,400 --> 01:02:36,480
Excuse me.

714
01:02:38,800 --> 01:02:39,920
Thank you.

715
01:02:40,679 --> 01:02:43,400
Those are beautiful flowers.

716
01:03:03,800 --> 01:03:05,320
I'm really sory.

717
01:03:08,360 --> 01:03:11,840
You better go back inside
or your father will come after me.

718
01:03:15,559 --> 01:03:17,360
Your stoy made me cy.

719
01:03:20,039 --> 01:03:21,320
You read it?

720
01:03:23,559 --> 01:03:24,800
Our secret?

721
01:03:26,920 --> 01:03:27,920
Yeah.

722
01:03:29,480 --> 01:03:30,720
Our secret.

723
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:04,080
Can I do anything else for you?

724
01:04:05,880 --> 01:04:08,200
No. child. Thank you.

725
01:04:09,960 --> 01:04:12,440
Then I wonder
if you'd do something for me.

726
01:04:16,599 --> 01:04:18,800
I want you to go khastegari.

727
01:04:19,840 --> 01:04:22,840
I want you to ask General Taheri
for his daughter's hand.

728
01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:26,840
Are you sure?

729
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:31,640
More sure than I've
ever been about anything.

730
01:04:35,039 --> 01:04:37,440
Then give me the phone
and my address book.

731
01:04:39,480 --> 01:04:40,600
Now?

732
01:04:41,239 --> 01:04:42,840
Then when?

733
01:04:47,679 --> 01:04:49,480
Yes. much better.

734
01:04:50,079 --> 01:04:52,840
lt was gracious of you to come.

735
01:04:53,760 --> 01:04:55,240
I called to ask.

736
01:04:55,840 --> 01:04:57,400
if you have time.

737
01:04:57,599 --> 01:04:59,200
if I may pay you
a visit tomorrow morning.

738
01:04:59,719 --> 01:05:01,760
It's an honourable matter.

739
01:05:02,519 --> 01:05:03,480
Nine o'clock?

740
01:05:03,679 --> 01:05:04,720
That's iust fine.

741
01:05:04,920 --> 01:05:05,880
Until then.

742
01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:19,440
Go home.

743
01:05:19,639 --> 01:05:21,200
I'll call you in an hour.

744
01:05:21,480 --> 01:05:23,760
Okay. Good luck.

745
01:05:29,599 --> 01:05:30,560
Hello?

746
01:05:30,679 --> 01:05:31,680
The General accepted.

747
01:05:31,800 --> 01:05:33,720
-He accepted?
-Yes, he accept_.

748
01:05:33,840 --> 01:05:36,240
But Soraya ian wants
to talk to you first.

749
01:05:36,800 --> 01:05:38,960
-About what?
-About what?

750
01:05:39,079 --> 01:05:42,040
How do I know about what?
She wants to talk to you.

751
01:05:42,239 --> 01:05:43,960
Okay. Okay. I'm on my way.

752
01:05:59,039 --> 01:06:02,360
How are you?
Come inside and have some tea.

753
01:06:03,199 --> 01:06:05,400
He didn't come for tea.

754
01:06:05,880 --> 01:06:08,440
lt doesn't matter.
we're going out for a walk.

755
01:06:13,119 --> 01:06:15,080
You do want to get married?

756
01:06:16,320 --> 01:06:18,680
-To me. I mean.
-Of course I do.

757
01:06:20,960 --> 01:06:23,680
It's iust... I want to tell you something.

758
01:06:24,840 --> 01:06:26,760
something you need to know.

759
01:06:28,079 --> 01:06:30,160
I don't want us to start with secrets.

760
01:06:33,599 --> 01:06:35,960
We lived in Virginia
before we came here.

761
01:06:36,079 --> 01:06:37,600
We left because

762
01:06:39,199 --> 01:06:41,400
I ran away with an Afghan man.

763
01:06:42,119 --> 01:06:45,080
I was 18.
I guess I thought I was being rebellious.

764
01:06:45,920 --> 01:06:48,280
We lived together for almost a month.

765
01:06:49,480 --> 01:06:52,160
All the Afghans in Virginia
were talking about it.

766
01:06:54,320 --> 01:06:55,520
My father eventually found us.

767
01:06:55,639 --> 01:06:59,320
He showed up at the door
and he made me come home.

768
01:06:59,440 --> 01:07:02,800
I was hysterical.
and I told him I hated him.

769
01:07:05,840 --> 01:07:08,400
We moved out to California
a few weeks later.

770
01:07:08,960 --> 01:07:12,320
I didn't talk to my father
for a vey long time. And now...

771
01:07:13,719 --> 01:07:16,560
Now I feel like he's the reason
why I'm here.

772
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,200
Does what I told you bother you?

773
01:07:22,719 --> 01:07:23,960
A little.

774
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:27,840
Does it bother you enough
to change your mind?

775
01:07:28,920 --> 01:07:30,160
No.

776
01:07:31,519 --> 01:07:33,200
Not even close.

777
01:07:35,639 --> 01:07:37,600
I'd mary you tonight if I could.

778
01:09:03,800 --> 01:09:05,200
What do you see?

779
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:08,680
The rest of my life.

780
01:10:01,760 --> 01:10:05,280
-They're so funny.
-They were crazy.

781
01:10:07,560 --> 01:10:09,040
That's a funny picture.

782
01:10:10,560 --> 01:10:11,800
They're so cute.

783
01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:15,600
-Amir ian?
-Right here. Baba.

784
01:10:15,720 --> 01:10:17,240
Help me to bed.

785
01:10:17,720 --> 01:10:18,880
Of course.

786
01:10:37,800 --> 01:10:40,320
I'll come back with your morphine
and a glass of water.

787
01:10:40,920 --> 01:10:41,880
No.

788
01:10:42,359 --> 01:10:44,000
There is no pain tonight.

789
01:10:46,479 --> 01:10:48,400
Come here. my daughter.

791
01:11:59,159 --> 01:12:00,320
San Francisco
200O

792
01:12:00,439 --> 01:12:02,120
lt will not be easy.

793
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:05,120
But you must come, Amir.

794
01:12:06,680 --> 01:12:07,760
All right.

795
01:12:07,880 --> 01:12:08,840
You're a good man.

796
01:12:08,960 --> 01:12:10,040
God willing.

797
01:12:10,359 --> 01:12:12,720
Goodbye.

798
01:12:28,720 --> 01:12:30,000
You all right?

799
01:12:31,479 --> 01:12:33,040
I have to go to Pakistan.

800
01:12:34,680 --> 01:12:35,880
Pakistan?

801
01:12:36,640 --> 01:12:38,480
Rahim Khan is vey sick.

802
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,200
Your father's friend?

803
01:12:41,319 --> 01:12:43,040
ls it safe right now?

804
01:12:45,279 --> 01:12:47,080
What about the book tour?

805
01:12:49,439 --> 01:12:52,240
There wouldn't be any books
if not for Rahim Khan.

806
01:13:00,600 --> 01:13:02,480
Peshawar. Pakistan

807
01:13:02,600 --> 01:13:04,520
It's terrible what's happening
in your county.

808
01:13:04,640 --> 01:13:07,320
Afghani people and Pakistani people.
they are like brothers.

809
01:13:07,439 --> 01:13:09,040
Muslim have to help Muslim.

810
01:13:10,359 --> 01:13:13,000
They call this area Afghan Town.

811
01:13:13,119 --> 01:13:16,280
Sometimes it feels like Peshawar
is a suburb of Kabul.

812
01:13:22,720 --> 01:13:24,120
This way.

813
01:13:44,239 --> 01:13:45,680
Amir ian.

814
01:13:48,119 --> 01:13:49,520
Amir ian.

815
01:13:49,760 --> 01:13:52,280
Welcome. welcome.

816
01:13:54,039 --> 01:13:56,400
You've become a man.

817
01:13:56,760 --> 01:13:58,960
General Taheri's daughter.

818
01:13:59,479 --> 01:14:01,480
She's a beauty.

819
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:04,800
Any children?

820
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:09,560
We tried. but

821
01:14:10,600 --> 01:14:13,000
it doesn't seem possible for us.

822
01:14:15,119 --> 01:14:16,200
Thank you.

823
01:14:18,880 --> 01:14:21,440
How long have you been in Pakistan?

824
01:14:21,680 --> 01:14:25,560
Less than a year.
Kabul is no longer safe for me.

825
01:14:26,359 --> 01:14:28,600
The Taliban are as bad as they say?

826
01:14:29,199 --> 01:14:30,320
Oh. worse.

827
01:14:30,439 --> 01:14:33,760
Much worse.
They don't let you be human.

828
01:14:34,119 --> 01:14:36,960
They even banned kite flying.

829
01:14:40,640 --> 01:14:42,800
I have something for you.

830
01:14:47,800 --> 01:14:49,080
What's this?

831
01:14:50,760 --> 01:14:51,880
Look.

832
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:04,680
''For Rahim Khan.
who listened to my stories

833
01:15:05,600 --> 01:15:07,720
''before I knew how to write them.''

834
01:15:15,479 --> 01:15:17,360
This is a great honour. Amir.

835
01:15:24,119 --> 01:15:25,880
Let me take you home with me.

836
01:15:26,680 --> 01:15:28,760
I can find you a good doctor.

837
01:15:29,439 --> 01:15:31,840
They're coming up with new treatments
all the time.

838
01:15:34,279 --> 01:15:35,880
Amir. Amir. Amir.

839
01:15:38,199 --> 01:15:41,200
I see America has infused you
with her optimism.

840
01:15:42,399 --> 01:15:45,600
But there is such a thing as God's will.

841
01:15:49,840 --> 01:15:51,080
Come. sit.

842
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:55,920
I didn't bring you here
to complain about my health.

843
01:15:57,399 --> 01:16:01,640
Forgive me. Amir ian.
Forgive me for what I have to tell you.

844
01:16:06,840 --> 01:16:08,360
Hassan is dead.

845
01:16:15,680 --> 01:16:16,720
How?

846
01:16:18,239 --> 01:16:21,360
You know I watched over
your father's house after you left.

847
01:16:23,119 --> 01:16:26,560
But none of the caretakers I hired
Iasted more than a year.

848
01:16:27,560 --> 01:16:30,120
Some were dishonest. some lazy.

849
01:16:32,119 --> 01:16:35,360
So a few years ago I went to Hazaraiat

850
01:16:37,239 --> 01:16:39,800
and brought Hassan
and his family home with me.

851
01:16:42,319 --> 01:16:46,160
His wife. Farzana. and his son. Sohrab.

852
01:16:48,479 --> 01:16:50,120
Rostam and Sohrab

853
01:16:52,279 --> 01:16:54,280
lt was so good to have them there.

854
01:16:55,960 --> 01:16:58,680
Hassan kept the house
from falling apart.

855
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:01,520
And Farzana cooked the meals.

856
01:17:01,920 --> 01:17:03,120
lt was good.

857
01:17:03,479 --> 01:17:04,920
Vey good.

858
01:17:06,439 --> 01:17:08,760
But when my health began to fail.

859
01:17:08,880 --> 01:17:12,760
well. there isn't a hospital in
Afghanistan that can help me.

860
01:17:12,880 --> 01:17:14,200
so I came here.

861
01:17:16,239 --> 01:17:19,840
A few weeks after I left
the Taliban came to the ho'use.

862
01:17:19,960 --> 01:17:23,600
Hassan told them that he was looking
after the house for me. but...

863
01:17:24,760 --> 01:17:28,800
They said that he was a liar and a thief
like all the other Hazaras.

864
01:17:28,920 --> 01:17:31,960
And they ordered him to leave
with his family by nightfall.

865
01:17:33,840 --> 01:17:36,160
Hassan wouldn't leave.

866
01:17:36,760 --> 01:17:41,120
So they took him to the street
and ordered him to kneel

867
01:17:43,279 --> 01:17:45,880
and shot him in the back of the head.

868
01:17:47,880 --> 01:17:51,160
Farzana came screaming
and attacked them and...

869
01:17:53,479 --> 01:17:55,000
They shot her. too.

870
01:17:57,199 --> 01:17:58,440
And the boy?

871
01:18:01,239 --> 01:18:02,280
Sohrab?

872
01:18:03,159 --> 01:18:05,880
He is in an orphanage

873
01:18:08,039 --> 01:18:09,680
in Karteh Seh.

874
01:18:11,119 --> 01:18:14,800
Hassan sent this to me a week
before he died.

875
01:18:17,079 --> 01:18:18,440
It's for you.

876
01:18:23,520 --> 01:18:25,720
He taught himself to read and write.

877
01:18:27,720 --> 01:18:31,240
He didn't want to send you a letter
until he could do it properly.

878
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:39,120
Amir.

879
01:18:41,319 --> 01:18:43,400
you need to go back to Kabul.

880
01:18:44,399 --> 01:18:46,960
I've arranged for a driver.
He's a good man.

881
01:18:47,079 --> 01:18:48,680
I can't go back to Kabul.

882
01:18:49,439 --> 01:18:52,840
Can't you pay someone here to go?
I'll pay for it if it's a matter of money.

883
01:18:52,960 --> 01:18:54,600
It's not about money.

884
01:18:56,600 --> 01:18:58,160
You are a stoyteller.

885
01:18:58,920 --> 01:19:01,360
Some part of you
has always known this stoy.

886
01:19:03,399 --> 01:19:06,120
Ali's first wife was from Jaghori.

887
01:19:07,479 --> 01:19:09,960
What does that
have to do with anything?

888
01:19:10,319 --> 01:19:13,440
After five years she left him childless.

889
01:19:14,479 --> 01:19:16,600
and married a man from Khost.

890
01:19:18,640 --> 01:19:20,920
She bore that man three daughters.

891
01:19:22,479 --> 01:19:25,320
Do you understand
what I'm tying to tell you?

892
01:19:26,319 --> 01:19:28,320
Ali was sterile.

893
01:19:29,760 --> 01:19:31,120
But he had Hassan.

894
01:19:31,239 --> 01:19:34,440
He raised Hassan. He didn't father him.

895
01:19:36,279 --> 01:19:40,880
Your father loved you both
because you were both his sons.

896
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:43,360
-and Sohrab...
-No.

897
01:19:43,760 --> 01:19:44,960
He's your nephew.

898
01:19:45,079 --> 01:19:46,760
I don't believe you.

899
01:19:48,039 --> 01:19:49,080
You do.

900
01:19:50,079 --> 01:19:51,840
That's what frightens you.

901
01:19:52,880 --> 01:19:54,440
You're saying

902
01:19:55,760 --> 01:19:56,840
my father.

903
01:19:58,159 --> 01:20:00,360
for all those years.

904
01:20:01,079 --> 01:20:02,640
lied to me.

905
01:20:03,600 --> 01:20:04,680
Please think.

906
01:20:05,840 --> 01:20:10,280
All that a man had back then
was his honour. his name.

907
01:20:10,560 --> 01:20:12,120
and if people talked...

908
01:20:12,239 --> 01:20:14,840
-He lied to me.
-He lied to both of you.

909
01:20:15,680 --> 01:20:18,680
And now there is a way
to be good again.

910
01:20:58,560 --> 01:21:01,400
~ln the name of God,
the merciful, the compassionate,

911
01:21:01,520 --> 01:21:04,680
~Amir agha, with my deepest respects.

912
01:21:05,359 --> 01:21:08,240
~My wife and son and l
pray this letter finds you in fine health,

913
01:21:08,359 --> 01:21:10,600
~and in the light of God's good graces.

914
01:21:10,720 --> 01:21:13,200
~I'm hopeful that one day I will hold
one of your letters in my hands

915
01:21:13,319 --> 01:21:15,680
~and read of your life in America.

916
01:21:15,800 --> 01:21:19,320
~l am tying to learn English.
It's such a tricky language.

917
01:21:19,439 --> 01:21:22,520
~But one day, agha. I miss your stories.

918
01:21:23,640 --> 01:21:26,440
~I've included a picture of me
and my son, Sohrab.

919
01:21:26,560 --> 01:21:28,240
~He's a good boy.

920
01:21:28,359 --> 01:21:30,080
~Rahim Khan and l
taught him how to read and write,

921
01:21:30,199 --> 01:21:32,880
~so he doesn't grow up
stupid like his father.

922
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:36,040
~And can he shoot
with that slingshot you gave me!

923
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:41,120
~But I fear for him, Amir agha.

924
01:21:41,239 --> 01:21:43,680
~The Afghanistan of our youth
is long dead.

925
01:21:43,800 --> 01:21:48,520
~Kindness is gone from the land,
and you cannot escape the killings.

926
01:21:48,640 --> 01:21:50,600
~Always the killings.

927
01:21:50,720 --> 01:21:53,840
~l dream that God will guide us
to a better day.

928
01:21:53,960 --> 01:21:57,360
~l dream that my son will grow up
tD be a good person,

929
01:21:57,479 --> 01:21:59,600
~a free person,

930
01:21:59,720 --> 01:22:01,440
~an important person.

931
01:22:01,560 --> 01:22:04,360
~l dream that flowers will bloom
in the streets of Kabul again,

932
01:22:04,479 --> 01:22:07,320
~and music will play
in the samovar houses,

933
01:22:07,439 --> 01:22:10,280
~and kites will ny in the skies.

934
01:22:10,399 --> 01:22:12,960
~And I dream that someday
you will return tD Kabul

935
01:22:13,079 --> 01:22:15,640
~to revisit the land of our childhood.

936
01:22:15,760 --> 01:22:19,840
~lf you do, you'll find
an old faithful friend waiting for you.

937
01:22:20,680 --> 01:22:23,560
~May God be with you always.

938
01:22:23,680 --> 01:22:25,160
~Hassan.~

939
01:22:37,039 --> 01:22:38,120
Hello?

940
01:22:38,960 --> 01:22:40,040
Hi.

941
01:22:41,479 --> 01:22:43,840
-Did I wake you up?
-No.

942
01:22:45,159 --> 01:22:46,600
You all right?

943
01:22:47,720 --> 01:22:49,560
I have to tell you a stoy.

944
01:22:52,560 --> 01:22:53,800
What's his name?

945
01:23:18,600 --> 01:23:20,360
Stop playing with it.

946
01:23:21,720 --> 01:23:23,520
I really have to wear it?

947
01:23:24,439 --> 01:23:28,560
You know what the Taliban will do to
you if they see you are clean-shaven?

948
01:24:22,239 --> 01:24:24,360
So what brings you back
to Afghanistan?

949
01:24:24,479 --> 01:24:27,400
Come to sell off your father's land.
pocket the money?

950
01:24:28,439 --> 01:24:30,120
I'm not here to sell anything.

951
01:24:31,039 --> 01:24:33,080
I'm going to Kabul to find a boy.

952
01:24:34,319 --> 01:24:35,720
A boy?

953
01:24:43,880 --> 01:24:45,360
This boy?

954
01:24:45,479 --> 01:24:47,440
This Hazara boy?

955
01:24:47,560 --> 01:24:48,880
Yeah.

956
01:24:50,079 --> 01:24:51,920
What he means to you?

957
01:24:54,199 --> 01:24:57,840
His father meant a lot to me.
He's the man in the photo.

958
01:24:59,199 --> 01:25:00,800
He's dead now.

959
01:25:02,039 --> 01:25:03,920
lt was a friend of yours?

960
01:25:05,560 --> 01:25:07,000
He was my brother.

961
01:25:14,840 --> 01:25:17,360
I feel like a tourist in my own county.

962
01:25:17,680 --> 01:25:21,040
You've always been a tourist here.
You just didn't know it.

963
01:25:25,439 --> 01:25:29,000
-What happened to the trees?
-The Russians chopped them down.

964
01:25:39,239 --> 01:25:41,120
You know what they're doing?

965
01:25:42,800 --> 01:25:44,240
He's selling his leg?

966
01:25:44,920 --> 01:25:46,960
He can get good money for it.

967
01:25:47,079 --> 01:25:49,360
Feed your kids for a couple of weeks.

968
01:26:02,520 --> 01:26:04,440
-What's that smell?
-Diesel.

969
01:26:05,960 --> 01:26:09,080
The power's always going off
so people use generators.

970
01:26:11,159 --> 01:26:14,160
Do you remember what this street
smelled like in the old days?

971
01:26:16,720 --> 01:26:20,880
Lamb kabob.

972
01:26:25,880 --> 01:26:28,360
Beard patrol.

973
01:26:33,039 --> 01:26:34,480
What's the matter with you?

974
01:26:35,119 --> 01:26:36,080
What?

975
01:26:36,199 --> 01:26:38,360
Don't you ever stare at them!

976
01:26:39,640 --> 01:26:40,920
Understand me?

977
01:26:41,560 --> 01:26:42,520
Never!

978
01:27:34,920 --> 01:27:36,560
We're looking for this boy.

979
01:27:36,680 --> 01:27:38,720
I'm sory.
I've never seen him.

980
01:27:39,199 --> 01:27:41,360
You barely looked
at the picture. my friend.

981
01:27:41,520 --> 01:27:43,440
I know all the children here

982
01:27:44,119 --> 01:27:45,840
and that one doesn't look familiar.

983
01:27:46,359 --> 01:27:47,800
And now. if you'll permit me...

984
01:27:48,039 --> 01:27:49,560
We don't mean him any harm.

985
01:27:49,720 --> 01:27:51,320
I told you he's not here.

986
01:27:51,479 --> 01:27:53,840
-Now. please. go away.
-Friend. we are not with the Taliban.

987
01:27:53,960 --> 01:27:56,040
The man wants to
take this boy to a safe place.

988
01:27:56,359 --> 01:27:57,880
I knew Sohrab's father.

989
01:27:58,279 --> 01:27:59,360
His name was Hassan.

990
01:27:59,960 --> 01:28:02,240
There's hope for this boy. Agha.

991
01:28:02,720 --> 01:28:04,160
A way out.

992
01:28:04,840 --> 01:28:06,640
I can take him back to America with me.

993
01:28:08,079 --> 01:28:09,960
I'm his uncle.

994
01:28:15,159 --> 01:28:17,560
What I have to tell you is not pleasant.

995
01:28:18,199 --> 01:28:20,760
I tell you. because I believe you.

996
01:28:21,319 --> 01:28:23,800
You have the look of desperate men.

997
01:28:30,319 --> 01:28:32,680
There is a Talib official.

998
01:28:33,680 --> 01:28:35,840
He visits evey month or two.

999
01:28:36,800 --> 01:28:38,960
He brings cash with him.

1000
01:28:39,159 --> 01:28:42,160
Not a lot. but better than nothing.

1001
01:28:43,319 --> 01:28:45,280
Usually. he takes a girl.

1002
01:28:46,359 --> 01:28:47,920
But not always.

1003
01:28:49,680 --> 01:28:50,920
And you allow this?

1004
01:28:51,520 --> 01:28:53,040
What choice do I have?

1005
01:28:53,880 --> 01:28:55,120
You're the director here.

1006
01:28:55,680 --> 01:28:57,400
Your iob is to watch over these children.

1007
01:28:57,520 --> 01:28:58,840
There is nothing I can do.

1008
01:28:58,960 --> 01:29:00,960
-You're selling children!
-Easy.

1009
01:29:01,079 --> 01:29:02,200
You're here to protect them!

1010
01:29:02,319 --> 01:29:03,360
Yes.

1011
01:29:03,479 --> 01:29:04,880
I am here to protect them.

1012
01:29:05,159 --> 01:29:06,200
Sit.

1013
01:29:08,239 --> 01:29:09,880
And you. brother?

1014
01:29:10,319 --> 01:29:12,960
You come here to rescue a boy.

1015
01:29:13,279 --> 01:29:16,040
take him back to America.
give him a good life.

1016
01:29:16,840 --> 01:29:18,920
lt must seem heroic. huh?

1017
01:29:19,560 --> 01:29:21,760
But what of the other
two hundred children?

1018
01:29:22,159 --> 01:29:23,800
You'll never see them again.

1019
01:29:23,920 --> 01:29:26,280
You'll never hear them
howling in the night.

1020
01:29:27,239 --> 01:29:29,440
I spent my life savings
on this orphanage.

1021
01:29:29,600 --> 01:29:33,560
Eveything I owned or inherited
I sold to run this godforsaken place.

1022
01:29:34,720 --> 01:29:38,480
You think I don't have family
in Pakistan or Iran?

1023
01:29:39,159 --> 01:29:42,080
I could have run like eveyone else.

1024
01:29:43,359 --> 01:29:46,160
lf I deny him one child. he takes 10.

1025
01:29:47,079 --> 01:29:49,560
So. I let him take one.

1026
01:29:50,119 --> 01:29:52,840
and leave the iudging to Allah.

1027
01:29:54,079 --> 01:29:56,760
I take his filthy money.
and I go to the bazaar.

1028
01:29:57,439 --> 01:29:58,680
and I buy food for the children.

1029
01:30:00,239 --> 01:30:02,800
You think I spend it on myself?

1030
01:30:03,600 --> 01:30:04,960
Look at me.

1031
01:30:06,319 --> 01:30:07,320
Look.

1032
01:30:08,079 --> 01:30:09,840
What happens to the children he takes?

1033
01:30:11,279 --> 01:30:13,680
Sometimes. they come back.

1034
01:30:14,880 --> 01:30:16,720
more often. they don't.

1035
01:30:19,520 --> 01:30:21,240
Who is he?

1036
01:30:22,119 --> 01:30:24,280
How do I find him?

1037
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:30,840
Go to the Ghazi Stadium tomorrow.

1038
01:30:31,039 --> 01:30:34,280
You'll see him at halftime.

1039
01:30:35,239 --> 01:30:37,760
He'll be the one making speeches.

1040
01:30:38,680 --> 01:30:42,160
Now. please leave.
You've frightened the children.

1041
01:30:44,840 --> 01:30:46,360
Pull over here.

1042
01:31:30,880 --> 01:31:31,840
We should go.

1043
01:31:37,119 --> 01:31:38,480
I have to look at one more thing.

1044
01:31:38,600 --> 01:31:40,600
Nothing that you remember
has survived.

1045
01:31:40,720 --> 01:31:42,040
Better to forget.

1046
01:31:43,079 --> 01:31:44,760
I don't want to forget any more.

1048
01:33:19,439 --> 01:33:21,240
Do you want to stay here?

1049
01:33:22,079 --> 01:33:23,640
No. but we have to.

1050
01:33:34,520 --> 01:33:35,600
That's him.

1051
01:33:43,399 --> 01:33:44,720
Brothers and sisters!

1052
01:33:45,239 --> 01:33:47,400
We are here today
to cary out Shari'a.

1053
01:33:47,760 --> 01:33:49,800
We are here today
tD cary out justice.

1054
01:33:50,319 --> 01:33:52,400
We listen to what God says,
and we obey.

1055
01:33:52,800 --> 01:33:53,800
And what does God say?

1056
01:33:54,039 --> 01:33:57,640
Evey sinner must be punished
in a manner befitting his sin.

1057
01:33:58,239 --> 01:34:01,280
Those are not my words,
nor the words of my brothers.

1058
01:34:01,600 --> 01:34:03,400
Those are the words of God!

1059
01:34:03,600 --> 01:34:06,320
And what manner of punishment
benefits the adulterer?

1060
01:34:06,560 --> 01:34:10,480
How shall we punish those
who dishonour the sanctity of marriage?

1061
01:34:11,359 --> 01:34:14,880
How shall we deal
with those who disobey God?

1062
01:34:15,520 --> 01:34:19,360
How shall we answer those who throw
stones at the windows of God's house?

1063
01:34:20,319 --> 01:34:22,840
We shall throw stones back!

1064
01:34:47,319 --> 01:34:48,360
My friend.

1065
01:34:48,600 --> 01:34:50,520
My friend. a word?

1066
01:34:51,840 --> 01:34:53,560
We have business with your brother.

1067
01:34:55,960 --> 01:34:57,720
Personal business.

1068
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:59,800
I guess I'll wait in the car.
This is your business now.

1069
01:36:01,199 --> 01:36:03,360
Thank you for helping me.

1070
01:36:14,720 --> 01:36:16,400
Anyone there?

1071
01:36:20,199 --> 01:36:22,880
I was told to come here.

1072
01:36:27,159 --> 01:36:28,120
Come in.

1073
01:36:29,279 --> 01:36:30,240
Thank you.

1074
01:36:42,439 --> 01:36:43,800
How soft.

1075
01:37:20,039 --> 01:37:21,120
Sit down.

1076
01:37:22,119 --> 01:37:23,200
Sit down.

1077
01:37:54,720 --> 01:37:56,920
I think there's been a mistake.

1078
01:37:57,279 --> 01:37:59,640
I came to see your friend.

1079
01:38:01,199 --> 01:38:03,480
The man who made
the speech at the stadium.

1080
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:05,720
He has other business.

1081
01:38:06,359 --> 01:38:08,120
You can do away with that now.

1082
01:38:10,880 --> 01:38:12,440
I'm not sure what you mean.

1083
01:38:13,119 --> 01:38:14,480
Take off your beard.

1084
01:38:29,880 --> 01:38:32,200
One of the better ones I've seen.

1085
01:38:33,520 --> 01:38:34,680
Take off the turban.

1086
01:38:40,600 --> 01:38:41,960
You come from America?

1087
01:38:44,239 --> 01:38:45,320
Yes.

1088
01:38:49,399 --> 01:38:50,480
I'm looking for a boy.

1089
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:52,880
lsn't eveybody?

1090
01:38:54,600 --> 01:38:57,360
I understand your friend
brought him here.

1091
01:38:58,239 --> 01:38:59,640
His name is Sohrab.

1092
01:39:00,600 --> 01:39:02,320
Let me ask you something.

1093
01:39:03,079 --> 01:39:05,200
What are you doing
with that whore America?

1094
01:39:05,880 --> 01:39:07,440
Why aren't you here

1095
01:39:08,119 --> 01:39:10,600
with your Muslim brothers.
serving your county.

1096
01:39:11,720 --> 01:39:14,040
I've been away for a long time.

1097
01:39:15,239 --> 01:39:16,480
That's an answer?

1098
01:39:18,039 --> 01:39:19,560
Not an answer. they say.

1099
01:39:21,359 --> 01:39:23,640
I'm only here for the boy.

1100
01:39:24,680 --> 01:39:25,840
Do you want to see him?

1101
01:40:03,960 --> 01:40:05,080
Come. my boy.

1102
01:40:11,319 --> 01:40:13,080
Such a talented little Hazara.

1103
01:40:14,439 --> 01:40:15,840
Leave us be.

1104
01:40:19,880 --> 01:40:21,040
I've been wondering.

1105
01:40:21,439 --> 01:40:24,120
whatever happened to
your great Baba. an_ay?

1106
01:40:25,840 --> 01:40:26,840
What did you think?

1107
01:40:27,319 --> 01:40:29,560
That you'd put on a fake beard
and I wouldn't recognise you?

1108
01:40:30,680 --> 01:40:32,920
I knew you the second
I saw you in the stadium.

1109
01:40:33,199 --> 01:40:35,680
I never forget a face. Never!

1110
01:40:37,079 --> 01:40:38,440
Assef?

1111
01:40:38,680 --> 01:40:39,800
Amir ian.

1112
01:40:41,680 --> 01:40:42,960
What are you doing here?

1113
01:40:43,199 --> 01:40:44,360
Me?

1114
01:40:44,600 --> 01:40:46,160
I'm home.

1115
01:40:46,840 --> 01:40:48,880
The question is.
what are you doing here?

1116
01:40:51,079 --> 01:40:52,880
I'm taking the boy home with me.

1117
01:40:56,479 --> 01:40:57,760
You want my advice?

1118
01:40:58,279 --> 01:40:59,480
Run away.

1119
01:40:59,880 --> 01:41:01,440
That's what you do best.

1120
01:41:02,840 --> 01:41:04,400
Not without Sohrab.

1121
01:41:06,079 --> 01:41:07,200
Why's that?

1122
01:41:07,520 --> 01:41:09,000
The boy's too good for his county?

1123
01:41:09,199 --> 01:41:10,840
What do you know about Afghanistan?

1124
01:41:11,479 --> 01:41:13,320
You weren't here when the Communists
shot our mullahs

1125
01:41:13,439 --> 01:41:14,840
and pissed in our mosques.

1126
01:41:14,960 --> 01:41:18,000
This county was like a beautiful
mansion littered with garbage.

1127
01:41:18,159 --> 01:41:21,160
We took out the garbage.
We brought law. We brought justice.

1128
01:41:21,279 --> 01:41:23,080
I have seen your laws

1129
01:41:23,479 --> 01:41:25,040
and your iustice.

1130
01:41:25,600 --> 01:41:27,440
And I'm taking the boy home with me.

1131
01:41:27,560 --> 01:41:29,000
All right. then.

1132
01:41:33,479 --> 01:41:36,200
Of course. I didn't say
you could take him for free.

1133
01:42:06,560 --> 01:42:07,800
No more.

1134
01:42:08,239 --> 01:42:09,840
No more. Agha.
Please. stop hurting him.

1135
01:42:10,159 --> 01:42:13,080
Put it down. Hazara.
You'll get yours ne_.

1136
01:42:14,199 --> 01:42:15,160
Put it down!

1137
01:42:20,800 --> 01:42:21,800
Get it out!

1138
01:42:24,680 --> 01:42:26,440
Get it out!

1140
01:42:53,319 --> 01:42:54,720
Kill him!

1141
01:44:08,680 --> 01:44:11,680
Go home to your family.

1142
01:44:25,039 --> 01:44:26,280
Are you Amir?

1143
01:44:28,359 --> 01:44:30,880
Rahim Khan left this for you.

1144
01:44:31,720 --> 01:44:32,960
Where did he go?

1145
01:44:33,640 --> 01:44:35,600
I did not ask.

1146
01:44:36,760 --> 01:44:38,160
But he'll be back?

1147
01:44:39,079 --> 01:44:42,360
He has left us. my child.

1148
01:44:58,560 --> 01:45:00,400
You're wasting your hand.

1150
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:19,160
Sohrab?

1151
01:45:28,479 --> 01:45:29,600
Sohrab?

1152
01:45:50,560 --> 01:45:51,600
Sohrab?

1153
01:46:08,880 --> 01:46:09,960
Sohrab?

1154
01:46:48,039 --> 01:46:50,520
Take off your shoes. dear brother.

1155
01:46:51,920 --> 01:46:53,600
Forgive me.

1156
01:48:08,319 --> 01:48:11,080
I thought I lost you.

1157
01:48:18,359 --> 01:48:21,440
He used to come get me
in the morning before prayers.

1158
01:48:23,560 --> 01:48:26,080
I didn't want him
to get me any more.

1159
01:48:30,600 --> 01:48:32,880
He won't. Sohrab.

1160
01:48:34,319 --> 01:48:35,960
I swear to you.

1161
01:48:37,439 --> 01:48:39,560
he can't get you any more.

1162
01:48:41,319 --> 01:48:43,200
Are your parents dead?

1163
01:48:46,319 --> 01:48:47,520
Yes.

1164
01:48:49,479 --> 01:48:51,720
Do you remember what they look like?

1165
01:48:54,439 --> 01:48:55,960
I never met my mother.

1166
01:48:58,279 --> 01:49:00,520
I remember
what my father looked like.

1167
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:04,680
I'm starting to forget their faces.

1168
01:49:06,039 --> 01:49:07,680
ls that bad?

1169
01:49:16,720 --> 01:49:18,400
Here.

1170
01:49:23,439 --> 01:49:27,040
Sometimes I'm glad they're dead.

1171
01:49:28,279 --> 01:49:29,280
Why?

1172
01:49:31,840 --> 01:49:32,880
Because...

1173
01:49:34,239 --> 01:49:36,480
Because I don't want them to see me.

1174
01:49:38,239 --> 01:49:40,240
I'm so dirty.

1175
01:49:42,079 --> 01:49:43,280
You're not dirty.

1176
01:49:52,279 --> 01:49:53,760
I won't hurt you.

1177
01:50:04,800 --> 01:50:06,040
That's my wife.

1178
01:50:11,640 --> 01:50:13,680
-Missed you.
-Missed you. too.

1179
01:50:16,520 --> 01:50:18,640
Sohrab ian. this is your aunt.

1180
01:50:21,319 --> 01:50:22,960
We've all been waiting for you.

1181
01:50:23,680 --> 01:50:26,120
Ready to meet your new family?

1182
01:50:28,159 --> 01:50:29,280
Let's go.

1183
01:50:38,920 --> 01:50:41,600
Do you like your room?

1184
01:50:57,000 --> 01:50:58,440
You don't look so bad.

1185
01:51:01,960 --> 01:51:03,840
I don't think he's looked at me once.

1186
01:51:05,880 --> 01:51:07,240
Give him time.

1187
01:51:08,720 --> 01:51:11,360
I'm knitting him
a turtleneck sweater for ne_ winter.

1188
01:51:11,720 --> 01:51:14,280
The sweaters they
sell here don't last a month.

1189
01:51:19,880 --> 01:51:21,080
Amir ian.

1190
01:51:21,199 --> 01:51:24,760
You're going to tell me why
you've brought this boy back with you?

1191
01:51:26,920 --> 01:51:28,320
What sort of question is that?

1192
01:51:28,560 --> 01:51:31,040
While you're busy
knitting sweaters. my dear.

1193
01:51:31,199 --> 01:51:33,760
I have to deal with the
community perception of our family.

1194
01:51:34,279 --> 01:51:38,080
People will ask why there is
a Hazara boy living with our daughter.

1195
01:51:38,199 --> 01:51:39,680
What do I tell them?

1196
01:51:41,319 --> 01:51:42,600
You can tell them...

1197
01:51:42,800 --> 01:51:43,920
It's all right.

1198
01:51:44,359 --> 01:51:45,640
The General is correct.

1199
01:51:46,159 --> 01:51:47,640
People will ask.

1200
01:51:48,079 --> 01:51:50,200
-Amir?
-It's all right.

1201
01:51:56,119 --> 01:51:57,800
You see. General Sahib.

1202
01:51:58,840 --> 01:52:01,360
my father slept with his servant's wife.

1203
01:52:02,760 --> 01:52:05,160
And she bore him a son named Hassan.

1204
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:08,520
Hassan is dead now.

1205
01:52:09,279 --> 01:52:12,520
That boy sleeping in the other room
is Hassan's son.

1206
01:52:14,279 --> 01:52:15,680
He's my nephew.

1207
01:52:16,720 --> 01:52:19,240
That's what you tell people
when they ask.

1208
01:52:21,199 --> 01:52:23,400
And one more thing. General Sahib.

1209
01:52:24,319 --> 01:52:28,240
You will never again refer to him
as ''a Hazara boy'' in my presence.

1210
01:52:28,880 --> 01:52:32,840
He has a name. and it's Sohrab.

1211
01:52:57,960 --> 01:52:59,480
-lt felt so real.
-Thank you.

1212
01:52:59,600 --> 01:53:01,280
My pleasure. Thank you.

1213
01:53:01,399 --> 01:53:03,600
Look. Look at that.

1214
01:53:08,279 --> 01:53:09,760
Excuse me a second.

1215
01:53:15,960 --> 01:53:17,680
I'd like that kite. please.

1216
01:53:18,359 --> 01:53:19,920
And I'll take this spool.

1218
01:53:39,119 --> 01:53:40,440
Do you like the kite?

1219
01:53:46,319 --> 01:53:47,600
Did I ever tell you

1220
01:53:48,760 --> 01:53:49,720
your father

1221
01:53:50,359 --> 01:53:52,400
was the best
kite runner in all Kabul?

1222
01:53:54,279 --> 01:53:56,880
He made all
the neighbourhood kids jealous.

1223
01:53:58,039 --> 01:53:59,280
He'd run the kites

1224
01:53:59,880 --> 01:54:02,560
and never look up at the sky.

1225
01:54:03,439 --> 01:54:04,960
Some claimed

1226
01:54:05,159 --> 01:54:08,040
he was iust chasing the kite's shadow.

1227
01:54:08,600 --> 01:54:12,680
But they didn't know him like I did.

1228
01:54:13,520 --> 01:54:16,520
Your father wasn't chasing shadows.

1229
01:54:17,840 --> 01:54:19,560
He iust knew.

1230
01:54:20,479 --> 01:54:21,920
That's all.

1231
01:54:27,199 --> 01:54:29,800
Do you want to help me fly this?

1232
01:54:31,119 --> 01:54:32,400
Okay.

1233
01:54:32,640 --> 01:54:34,720
Looks like I have to fly it solo.

1234
01:54:45,399 --> 01:54:46,920
Last chance.

1235
01:54:50,520 --> 01:54:51,680
Here I go.

1236
01:55:01,119 --> 01:55:02,560
It's a good kite. no?

1237
01:55:04,840 --> 01:55:06,240
Do you want to ty?

1238
01:55:08,399 --> 01:55:09,520
Here.

1239
01:55:12,439 --> 01:55:13,800
Hold it tight. Sohrab ian.

1240
01:55:14,960 --> 01:55:16,280
Good iob. Sohrab.

1241
01:55:28,399 --> 01:55:29,560
Pull. pull. pull!

1242
01:55:41,600 --> 01:55:43,360
Looks like someone wants a fight.

1243
01:55:45,119 --> 01:55:46,520
Are you sure?

1244
01:55:56,640 --> 01:55:58,480
Let's teach him a lesson. no?

1245
01:55:58,880 --> 01:56:00,280
Watch. Sohrab.

1246
01:56:00,600 --> 01:56:04,040
I'm going to show you
one of your father's favourite tricks.

1247
01:56:04,199 --> 01:56:05,640
An old technique.

1248
01:56:06,199 --> 01:56:07,360
Lift and Dive.

1249
01:56:12,159 --> 01:56:13,560
Come.

1250
01:56:18,199 --> 01:56:19,600
Come closer.

1251
01:56:27,159 --> 01:56:28,600
Here he comes!

1252
01:56:29,479 --> 01:56:30,880
We're going to catch him now. right?

1253
01:56:43,319 --> 01:56:44,960
Look. I cut him!

1254
01:56:47,880 --> 01:56:49,520
What are you doing.
you can't hold it right?

1255
01:56:49,640 --> 01:56:50,800
I'm sory!

1256
01:56:51,239 --> 01:56:52,840
Do you want me to run that kite for you?

1257
01:56:55,359 --> 01:56:57,480
For you. a thousand times over.

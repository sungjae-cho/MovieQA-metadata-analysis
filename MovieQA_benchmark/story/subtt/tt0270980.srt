1
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:15,000


2
00:00:23,727 --> 00:00:27,127
You know, you ever heard
someone say that old expression,

3
00:00:27,227 --> 00:00:31,827
"Everything happens for a reason"?
Well, I don't think that applies to me.

4
00:00:32,527 --> 00:00:34,627
I mean, I spend every morning
rushing to work

5
00:00:34,727 --> 00:00:38,527
trying to catch the same subway
to the same lousy job.

6
00:00:38,627 --> 00:00:39,927
What's the reason for that?

7
00:00:40,027 --> 00:00:44,427
See, I'm a researcher for one of the
biggest publishing houses in Chicago,

8
00:00:44,527 --> 00:00:46,527
but where I really belong is in Creative.

9
00:00:46,527 --> 00:00:51,127
The problem is, is my boss doesn't
know it yet, so I'm totally frustrated.

10
00:00:51,227 --> 00:00:53,127
While my friend Paul keeps telling me,

11
00:00:53,227 --> 00:00:56,427
"You gotta be optimistic.
You gotta be positive. "

12
00:00:56,527 --> 00:00:58,027
OK. OK. You know what?

13
00:00:58,127 --> 00:01:01,527
Today is gonna be my lucky day.
Today is gonna be my...

14
00:01:01,627 --> 00:01:04,827
- Aah!
- Oh! Wow!

15
00:01:04,927 --> 00:01:07,927
- Hey, look at that, It's your lucky day,
- Did you just see that?

16
00:01:07,927 --> 00:01:08,927
Oh, I've seen it a million times,

17
00:01:09,027 --> 00:01:10,427
- You want it?
- No,

18
00:01:10,427 --> 00:01:13,027
I don't want it, Go ahead,
You got a new briefcase,

19
00:01:13,127 --> 00:01:15,027
Yeah, maybe its got a name
on it or something,

20
00:01:15,127 --> 00:01:17,527
- Oh, come... What are you, nuts?
- What?

21
00:01:17,627 --> 00:01:19,127
- You're gonna return it?
- Yeah,

22
00:01:19,227 --> 00:01:21,427
Did you not just say
you needed a new one?

23
00:01:21,527 --> 00:01:22,927
Yeah, when I get my raise,

24
00:01:22,927 --> 00:01:24,927
Haven't you been working
there for, like, a year?

25
00:01:25,027 --> 00:01:27,427
I bet Taylor doesn't even know
you work there, I'd be pissed,

26
00:01:27,527 --> 00:01:31,727
- Are you pissed? I'd be pissed,
- Yeah, I'm-I'm a little pissed,

27
00:01:31,827 --> 00:01:35,127
You know, come to think of it,
I've never really seen you angry before,

28
00:01:35,127 --> 00:01:36,727
Henderson, you ever
seen Tom really angry?

29
00:01:36,827 --> 00:01:39,427
- No,
- All right, fine, So I don't get angry,

30
00:01:39,527 --> 00:01:41,227
What is that, a bad thing?

31
00:01:41,327 --> 00:01:44,927
It's, you know, you keep it bottled up
and then sooner or later,

32
00:01:44,927 --> 00:01:48,027
you come into work and you mow
everyone down with one of those...

33
00:01:48,127 --> 00:01:51,227
- AK-47,
- AK-47, You know, just to impress, uh...

34
00:01:51,327 --> 00:01:53,127
- Jodie Foster,
- Jodie Foster,

35
00:01:53,227 --> 00:01:56,427
(chuckles)) All right, I'll do it
on your day off, all right?

36
00:01:56,427 --> 00:02:01,027
(Paul) Touché, There she is,
It's your Jodie Foster,

37
00:02:01,127 --> 00:02:02,127
Paul, come on, man,

38
00:02:02,227 --> 00:02:03,527
How you ever gonna get
to know her if you just sit there?

39
00:02:03,627 --> 00:02:05,527
It's Taylor's daughter, man, I can't just...

40
00:02:05,627 --> 00:02:10,027
You can't just what? Huh? Are you
gonna be a loser your whole life? Hmm?

41
00:02:10,127 --> 00:02:13,527
Just go over there
and talk to her, Go, Go,

42
00:02:13,527 --> 00:02:16,427
- OK, fine, I'm going, I'm going,
- You're going,

43
00:02:34,027 --> 00:02:35,427
Excuse me,

44
00:02:35,527 --> 00:02:37,027
Aah!

45
00:02:37,127 --> 00:02:39,127
(baby crying))

46
00:02:41,227 --> 00:02:42,527
(mouthing))

47
00:02:46,527 --> 00:02:48,227
Hi, I'm--

48
00:02:50,327 --> 00:02:51,527
Ah...

49
00:02:53,127 --> 00:02:55,027
I-- Oh!

50
00:02:56,027 --> 00:02:59,027
Uh... I-- He wa--

51
00:03:00,227 --> 00:03:01,827
Oh,

52
00:03:05,927 --> 00:03:07,927
(dog growling))

53
00:03:08,027 --> 00:03:09,027
Oh! Uh...

54
00:03:09,027 --> 00:03:11,527
- What are you doing to my dog?
- Ma'am...

55
00:03:11,627 --> 00:03:14,427
- Who's taunting my dog?
- No one's taunting your dog, He--

56
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:16,227
Oh! Uh...

57
00:03:16,327 --> 00:03:18,427
Um, the-the d-- Um...

58
00:03:19,327 --> 00:03:22,527
Here, why don't you take my seat? Here,

59
00:03:25,027 --> 00:03:26,627
Great, Now, that's great,

60
00:03:26,727 --> 00:03:28,327
Two more minutes, and I'm gonna
be closer than you are,

61
00:03:28,327 --> 00:03:30,027
Look, Opening, Go,

62
00:03:30,027 --> 00:03:32,127
Just go,

63
00:03:32,227 --> 00:03:34,427
Go, Go,

64
00:03:35,827 --> 00:03:37,327
It's OK, Go, just go,

65
00:03:40,427 --> 00:03:44,327
(conductor) Lake Street.
Lake Street is next.

66
00:03:46,527 --> 00:03:49,627
You're Tom Stansfield, right?
From Research?

67
00:03:49,727 --> 00:03:53,627
Yeah, Yeah, Tom, Tom Stansfield,

68
00:03:58,527 --> 00:04:01,927
Stansfield from Research,

69
00:04:05,027 --> 00:04:06,527
It's a growing sport, you know?

70
00:04:06,527 --> 00:04:09,027
Paul, there is no way that she thought
that it was a wrestling magazine,

71
00:04:09,127 --> 00:04:11,627
Oh, come on, Get over it, OK?

72
00:04:11,727 --> 00:04:13,927
You're a little embarrassed,
It happens, OK?

73
00:04:14,027 --> 00:04:15,627
Let me tell you something,
If I had a dime for every time

74
00:04:15,727 --> 00:04:17,527
a gay naked magazine fell out of my...
I'm kidding, I'm kidding,

75
00:04:17,627 --> 00:04:18,627
What? Paul!

76
00:04:18,727 --> 00:04:20,427
No, But seriously,
so you're a little humiliated,

77
00:04:20,527 --> 00:04:23,527
At least now we've established
that she knows who you are, right?

78
00:04:23,627 --> 00:04:25,627
- I'm gonna have to leave the company,
- No, you're not,

79
00:04:25,627 --> 00:04:26,927
Oh, God, There she is,

80
00:04:27,027 --> 00:04:29,127
Oh, and I need to see the proofs
on Thailand immediately,

81
00:04:29,127 --> 00:04:31,327
All right, What else have we got?

82
00:04:36,827 --> 00:04:39,727
- Are you Tom?
- Yes,

83
00:04:39,827 --> 00:04:43,927
- Mr, Taylor wants to see you,
- Oh... OK,

84
00:04:44,527 --> 00:04:45,527
OK,

85
00:04:45,627 --> 00:04:49,127
OK, you see? This is your chance, This
is fate, This is what I'm talking about,

86
00:04:49,227 --> 00:04:52,227
It's about that new opening in Creative
and you're the man for the job,

87
00:04:52,327 --> 00:04:54,627
You're gonna go in there and you're
gonna pitch him those book ideas,

88
00:04:54,727 --> 00:04:56,527
No, I just... I'm really not ready,

89
00:04:56,627 --> 00:04:58,827
Let's get to business,
Now we're steppin' up, OK,

90
00:04:58,927 --> 00:05:00,627
Come on, You're gonna go in there,
you're gonna pitch him an inside curve...

91
00:05:00,727 --> 00:05:02,127
Wait, wait, Where is my blue folder?

92
00:05:02,127 --> 00:05:04,327
You don't need it, Enough with
the excuses already, Come here,

93
00:05:04,427 --> 00:05:06,927
- You look good, You feel good?
- I feel like I'm gonna throw up,

94
00:05:07,027 --> 00:05:08,827
Well, that's good,
I want you to use that, OK?

95
00:05:08,927 --> 00:05:11,027
What is this? This dad's?
It's nice, Now get in there, OK?

96
00:05:11,127 --> 00:05:13,927
- Don't-don't touch my ass,
- What? It was a light spank, It was light,

97
00:05:17,227 --> 00:05:18,427
- Hey,
- Hey,

98
00:05:18,427 --> 00:05:21,027
- Uh, do I just go in there?
- Um, no, He's not finished yet,

99
00:05:21,127 --> 00:05:23,427
- but you can have a seat over there,
- Oh, OK,

100
00:05:23,527 --> 00:05:26,127
Let me explain something
to you, Henderson,

101
00:05:26,227 --> 00:05:31,627
I did not dislike your ideas,
I found them loathsome,

102
00:05:33,527 --> 00:05:36,127
I hated them,

103
00:05:36,227 --> 00:05:38,827
- You're dismissed,
- From your office?

104
00:05:38,827 --> 00:05:40,927
Nice try,

105
00:05:44,227 --> 00:05:47,727
- Good luck, You're gonna need it...
- He's ready to see you,

106
00:05:47,827 --> 00:05:49,127
You can come in,

107
00:05:49,227 --> 00:05:52,127
You know what? We should have
never let up after the Revolution!

108
00:05:52,127 --> 00:05:54,627
Sit down, Sit down, Coffee?

109
00:05:54,627 --> 00:05:58,727
We shouldn't have left you at toehold,
We should have driven you to the sea!

110
00:06:01,127 --> 00:06:05,027
Now... what's this I hear
about you making threats

111
00:06:05,127 --> 00:06:08,227
to spray this place with an AK-47?

112
00:06:08,227 --> 00:06:10,227
What?

113
00:06:11,227 --> 00:06:16,427
Oh, oh, oh, No, That...
I was just making a joke,

114
00:06:16,527 --> 00:06:19,627
Oh, that's funny to you?
Killing everyone in this office?

115
00:06:19,727 --> 00:06:26,427
No, No, No, no, no, no, The...
Paul said how I never get angry...

116
00:06:26,527 --> 00:06:29,027
And what about you
making fun of midgets?

117
00:06:29,127 --> 00:06:30,827
I never made fun of midgets,

118
00:06:30,827 --> 00:06:33,227
You said it'd be fun to date one

119
00:06:33,327 --> 00:06:35,327
because then you could rest
your beer on her head,

120
00:06:35,427 --> 00:06:37,627
No, No, I never said anything like that,

121
00:06:37,727 --> 00:06:40,527
Apparently Henderson thinks you did,

122
00:06:40,627 --> 00:06:43,927
Now I've got a good sense of humor,
but that's just plain sick,

123
00:06:43,927 --> 00:06:46,727
- But, sir, I didn't say...
- Audrey?

124
00:06:48,027 --> 00:06:50,627
- Which file did I ask you for?
- Uh, the Platt file?

125
00:06:50,727 --> 00:06:54,027
- John Platt, Not Sam Platt,
- I'm sorry, I guess I didn't think that...

126
00:06:54,127 --> 00:06:55,927
That's right, You didn't think,

127
00:06:56,027 --> 00:06:59,027
Now if it's not too much trouble,
if you could fetch me the right file...

128
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:01,327
- OK,
- And get Tom and me some doughnuts,

129
00:07:01,427 --> 00:07:02,827
OK,

130
00:07:02,827 --> 00:07:07,527
Now... I'm told you've been trying
to schedule a meeting with me

131
00:07:07,627 --> 00:07:11,127
about some ideas, What are they?

132
00:07:11,127 --> 00:07:16,127
Oh, uh... yeah, I had-l had some ideas,

133
00:07:18,127 --> 00:07:21,327
- Something wrong with the coffee?
- Uh, no, It's fine,

134
00:07:21,427 --> 00:07:23,927
- Why'd you make a face?
- What?

135
00:07:23,927 --> 00:07:27,227
Oh, well... It's-it's a little bitter, but...

136
00:07:30,527 --> 00:07:33,727
- Jesus, Audrey, get in here!
- Sir, really, it's f... It's not a problem,

137
00:07:33,727 --> 00:07:36,527
- I've burped up stuff better than this,
- Sir, it's fine,

138
00:07:36,627 --> 00:07:39,627
- Is something wrong?
- Taste Tom's coffee,

139
00:07:39,727 --> 00:07:42,127
No, really, It's OK,

140
00:07:43,827 --> 00:07:47,427
- How would you rate that?
- Well, it's not that great,

141
00:07:47,427 --> 00:07:53,227
Not that great? I guess so,
Tom thinks it's shit,

142
00:07:53,327 --> 00:07:56,427
Audrey, are you retarded?

143
00:07:56,427 --> 00:07:59,727
It's not a rhetorical question,
Are you retarded?

144
00:07:59,827 --> 00:08:00,827
No, I'm not retarded,

145
00:08:00,927 --> 00:08:05,327
Because a retarded person can make
a cup of coffee, Am I right, Tom?

146
00:08:05,427 --> 00:08:07,727
Oh, I... I don't-I don't really know much

147
00:08:07,827 --> 00:08:10,427
about the limitations
of the handicapped,

148
00:08:10,427 --> 00:08:15,727
I know of an employment agency that
hires out retarded people for $4 an hour,

149
00:08:15,827 --> 00:08:20,427
So, if making a cup of coffee is too
difficult a task for you, Miss Bennett,

150
00:08:20,527 --> 00:08:23,527
perhaps you'd be good enough to let
me know, and I'll contact this agency

151
00:08:23,627 --> 00:08:27,127
and give a retarded person a job,

152
00:08:28,727 --> 00:08:30,727
(mouths)) Wow,

153
00:08:32,627 --> 00:08:36,827
- I wasn't too rough on her, was l?
- Well, she is new and all,

154
00:08:36,927 --> 00:08:40,227
Maybe I was out of line, But do you
understand what I'm dealing with?

155
00:08:40,327 --> 00:08:44,027
I mean, here I am trying
to fill a position in Creative,

156
00:08:44,027 --> 00:08:48,827
and I can't seem to find one person
responsible enough to earn my trust,

157
00:08:48,827 --> 00:08:52,227
I sometimes wonder if anyone here
even knows what they're doing,

158
00:08:52,327 --> 00:08:54,027
I can understand how you
could see it that way, sir, but...

159
00:08:54,127 --> 00:08:56,927
So you don't think I was out of line?

160
00:08:58,727 --> 00:09:02,927
Well, if what you're saying
is that a company

161
00:09:03,027 --> 00:09:05,927
is only as strong as its weakest link,
that makes sense, but...

162
00:09:06,027 --> 00:09:08,227
Exactly, That's exactly right,

163
00:09:08,327 --> 00:09:10,727
A company is only as strong
as its weakest link,

164
00:09:10,827 --> 00:09:12,727
- Yeah...
- Audrey, get in here!

165
00:09:12,827 --> 00:09:14,727
You were right, Tom,
I was too soft on her,

166
00:09:14,827 --> 00:09:16,027
- What? No,
- Yeah?

167
00:09:16,027 --> 00:09:18,027
Audrey, after talking it over
with Tom here,

168
00:09:18,027 --> 00:09:21,127
I've come to realize that
I'm gonna have to let you go,

169
00:09:21,127 --> 00:09:23,927
- You're firing me?!
- I'm sorry, It's just not working out,

170
00:09:24,027 --> 00:09:25,927
- But, sir, I was suggesting...
- I take my job very seriously,

171
00:09:26,027 --> 00:09:28,227
A chain is only as strong
as its weakest link,

172
00:09:28,327 --> 00:09:31,427
- Right, but there's a whole other side,
- Thanks for the support,

173
00:09:31,527 --> 00:09:33,727
Audrey, empty out your desk
by the end of the day,

174
00:09:33,727 --> 00:09:35,827
- Fine,
- Sir, this... I...

175
00:09:35,927 --> 00:09:37,527
Thanks for straightening me
out there, Tom,

176
00:09:37,627 --> 00:09:40,027
Right, right, But I didn't get to say
what I wanted to say,

177
00:09:40,027 --> 00:09:44,727
Oh, your ideas, of course, Schedule
an appointment with my new secretary,

178
00:09:51,827 --> 00:09:55,127
Tom, Are you OK?

179
00:09:55,127 --> 00:09:58,027
Uh... yeah, sure,

180
00:09:58,127 --> 00:10:00,027
I'm guessing by the way
you look he's on another one

181
00:10:00,127 --> 00:10:01,427
of his rampages this morning,

182
00:10:01,427 --> 00:10:03,727
- Definitely,
- Damn,

183
00:10:03,727 --> 00:10:05,227
I was hoping to catch him
in a good mood,

184
00:10:05,227 --> 00:10:09,427
Yeah, that's, um...
that's probably not gonna happen,

185
00:10:09,427 --> 00:10:12,127
I'm supposed to go to this party tonight,
but my dad's making me housesit

186
00:10:12,227 --> 00:10:14,227
for his stupid bird while
he's away this weekend,

187
00:10:14,327 --> 00:10:16,927
Well, why don't you go in there
and tell him you're not gonna do it?

188
00:10:17,027 --> 00:10:18,727
I can't just...

189
00:10:18,827 --> 00:10:22,027
You can't just what? I mean, live your
own life and have a free weekend?

190
00:10:22,127 --> 00:10:25,027
No, it's not that,

191
00:10:26,427 --> 00:10:29,027
- Wait, it is that,
- Yeah,

192
00:10:29,027 --> 00:10:32,827
- I should just go to that party,
- Yeah, of course,

193
00:10:33,527 --> 00:10:38,427
Well, um... OK, I'm gonna
go back to, uh, work,

194
00:10:38,527 --> 00:10:40,627
OK, sure,

195
00:10:40,727 --> 00:10:44,427
Tom? I know this might seem
a little out of place

196
00:10:44,427 --> 00:10:46,427
because we barely
even know each other,

197
00:10:46,427 --> 00:10:49,127
But, do you have any plans tonight?

198
00:10:50,627 --> 00:10:51,827
(mouths)) No, no, no,

199
00:10:51,827 --> 00:10:56,327
- Uh... no, I'm-I'm wide open,
- We won't be home too late,

200
00:10:56,327 --> 00:10:57,627
Hey, it's no problem,

201
00:10:57,627 --> 00:11:00,727
So the party starts at 7,
You could be at my dad's house by 6?

202
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:02,527
- Sure,
- You sure you're cool with this?

203
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:05,727
- Are you kidding me?
- Tom, you're such a sweetheart,

204
00:11:05,827 --> 00:11:09,627
Thank you so much,
I'm gonna love you forever for this,

205
00:11:10,827 --> 00:11:14,627
- All right, Yeah, who's the man now?
- See? What'd I tell you?

206
00:11:14,627 --> 00:11:18,527
(chuckles)) I'm a lady-killer,

207
00:11:22,327 --> 00:11:24,927
How the hell could he be
so excited about housesitting?

208
00:11:25,027 --> 00:11:29,227
He's nice, Daddy, That's how,
Most guys wouldn't even offer to do that,

209
00:11:29,327 --> 00:11:31,927
I don't know if I want him
around my bird,

210
00:11:31,927 --> 00:11:36,027
Oh, Dad, will you just relax?
It's gonna be fine, I promise, OK?

211
00:11:36,127 --> 00:11:39,827
I'll check in as soon as I get there, 8:00,

212
00:11:40,427 --> 00:11:43,227
If I sense anything's wrong,
you're coming back here,

213
00:11:43,327 --> 00:11:45,327
OK, OK,

214
00:11:55,227 --> 00:11:58,227
(. light rock)

215
00:12:32,927 --> 00:12:35,127
Very good, Right on time,

216
00:12:35,227 --> 00:12:40,127
Oh, sir, Uh... Hey, is that a bear trap?

217
00:12:40,227 --> 00:12:44,527
Yes, It's to keep the neighbor's kids
out of my yard,

218
00:12:51,527 --> 00:12:56,527
Sir, I just wanted to let you know
how much I appreciate you...

219
00:12:56,627 --> 00:12:59,227
well... letting tonight happen,

220
00:12:59,227 --> 00:13:04,927
I mean, I know it means a lot to Lisa,
and I think you're doing the right thing,

221
00:13:05,627 --> 00:13:07,427
I don't know what
you're planning, Stansfield,

222
00:13:07,527 --> 00:13:11,027
but you're attitude
is making me very nervous,

223
00:13:12,827 --> 00:13:16,227
- Those socks are clean, right?
- Um...

224
00:13:16,327 --> 00:13:21,327
- You hesitated, Put those on,
- Are you serious?

225
00:13:31,327 --> 00:13:34,227
If you want to watch TV,
the remote's there,

226
00:13:34,327 --> 00:13:37,327
That panel controls the lights,
alarm, skylight, etc,

227
00:13:37,427 --> 00:13:39,027
Yeah, I probably won't
use any of that stuff,

228
00:13:39,127 --> 00:13:42,327
- You know, since the party starts at 7,
- Party?

229
00:13:42,427 --> 00:13:46,127
I made it clear to Lisa you're not
to have any guests in here,

230
00:13:46,127 --> 00:13:49,527
You're the only one
allowed in the house,

231
00:13:50,327 --> 00:13:55,427
- What? Lisa's not here?
- No, Of course not,

232
00:13:56,327 --> 00:13:59,527
Lisa's at the party...

233
00:14:00,627 --> 00:14:03,327
and I'm staying here,

234
00:14:03,427 --> 00:14:07,427
Is this concept too complicated
for you, Stansfield?

235
00:14:09,827 --> 00:14:12,727
Don't touch the furniture,

236
00:14:15,927 --> 00:14:18,927
And this is my bird's room,

237
00:14:18,927 --> 00:14:22,327
(chuckles)) He's got his own room?

238
00:14:24,527 --> 00:14:27,027
That's cool,

239
00:14:29,727 --> 00:14:33,227
- (gasps))
- How's my little boy?

240
00:14:33,327 --> 00:14:38,427
- This is OJ,
- OJ? Like the murderer?

241
00:14:38,527 --> 00:14:43,527
No, Like the football player,
OJ Simpson,

242
00:14:43,527 --> 00:14:46,827
I've set the alarm,
When you hear it go off, feed him,

243
00:14:46,827 --> 00:14:50,727
- (mice squeaking))
- Aw, What do I feed these little guys?

244
00:14:50,727 --> 00:14:56,827
They don't get fed, They are the food,
His diet varies, but they're his favorites,

245
00:14:56,927 --> 00:14:59,527
Hey, don't you have to shut these doors?

246
00:14:59,527 --> 00:15:03,227
Not anymore, He's been depressed
since his mate died,

247
00:15:03,227 --> 00:15:07,327
He won't fly, Just sits in his cage,

248
00:15:10,027 --> 00:15:15,027
Medication, Give him two
of these at 1 0:00,

249
00:15:15,127 --> 00:15:17,227
I have to shove these down his throat?

250
00:15:17,327 --> 00:15:20,927
Just one, The other is inserted
into his rectum,

251
00:15:21,027 --> 00:15:23,027
Don't worry, It's not
too unpleasant for him,

252
00:15:23,027 --> 00:15:28,327
- He doesn't bite, does he?
- No, Not unless you taunt him,

253
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:29,827
You're not planning on taunting him,
are you, Tom?

254
00:15:29,927 --> 00:15:31,427
- No,
- I mean, that'd be really sick,

255
00:15:31,427 --> 00:15:33,827
No, of course not,

256
00:15:35,127 --> 00:15:38,027
And the most important thing,
make sure he gets a pint of water,

257
00:15:38,127 --> 00:15:40,427
The medication tends to dry him out
and then he can't breathe,

258
00:15:40,527 --> 00:15:42,727
- OK,
- Well, I must be off,

259
00:15:42,827 --> 00:15:45,927
- Henderson should be waiting outside,
- Henderson? I thought you fired him,

260
00:15:45,927 --> 00:15:48,027
Because his ideas were stupid?
Of course not,

261
00:15:48,127 --> 00:15:50,027
He's gonna drive me to the train station,

262
00:15:50,127 --> 00:15:53,727
So, you can leave as soon
as Lisa and Hans get back,

263
00:15:53,727 --> 00:15:56,127
- Hans?
- Lisa's boyfriend,

264
00:15:57,027 --> 00:16:01,327
So remember, uh... water in the bowl,
medication, and...

265
00:16:01,327 --> 00:16:05,527
anything happens to this house
while I'm gone, I'll kill you,

266
00:16:07,727 --> 00:16:09,727
(door shuts))

267
00:16:09,827 --> 00:16:12,227
(Paul over phone)) You're housesitting?
You gotta be kidding me.

268
00:16:12,327 --> 00:16:13,427
(Tom)) I know, it sucks,

269
00:16:13,427 --> 00:16:16,427
What are you talking about?
Don't you see? This is a test.

270
00:16:16,427 --> 00:16:18,827
You watch Taylor's house,
come up with a couple of great ideas

271
00:16:18,927 --> 00:16:20,827
and if everything goes smooth,
you get the promotion.

272
00:16:20,927 --> 00:16:23,927
- You think so?
- Of course I do. What could be easier?

273
00:16:24,027 --> 00:16:25,827
(crackles))

274
00:16:25,827 --> 00:16:28,927
(. "Not What I Wanted" by Evan Olson))

275
00:16:40,427 --> 00:16:43,827
(Lisa giggling)) What are you
doing, Hans? Come here.

276
00:16:43,827 --> 00:16:48,427
Baby, you're gonna burn so bad if you
don't let me put this on you right now.

277
00:16:52,427 --> 00:16:58,227
Oh, my God. You scared me, Hans.
You're insane. Put that down.

278
00:16:59,327 --> 00:17:03,527
Want to put some on me?
Put some lotion on me.

279
00:17:10,227 --> 00:17:14,027
- Is Jack around?
- Hey... what? Who are you?

280
00:17:14,127 --> 00:17:18,127
It's OK, I'm Red Taylor, I'm Jack's son,
I let myself in the back,

281
00:17:18,227 --> 00:17:20,227
- Oh, Hey, Tom Stansfield,
- Hey,

282
00:17:20,327 --> 00:17:23,827
Tom, nice to meet you,
Am I interrupting something here?

283
00:17:23,927 --> 00:17:29,127
Oh, no, Uh... I was... uh...
Oh, your shoes,

284
00:17:29,227 --> 00:17:33,427
Nike, Uh, listen, Tom, can you
do me a favor? I lost my TV Guide.

285
00:17:33,527 --> 00:17:37,527
I came over here to see if maybe
my dad's got a copy of one,

286
00:17:37,627 --> 00:17:40,127
You haven't seen a copy of
the guide laying around, have you?

287
00:17:40,127 --> 00:17:42,927
- My sister in?
- No, actually she's out for the evening,

288
00:17:42,927 --> 00:17:46,527
- Bingo, (chuckles))
- Oh,

289
00:17:46,627 --> 00:17:50,327
So, uh, you're here to...

290
00:17:51,227 --> 00:17:53,227
- Housesit,
- Oh,

291
00:17:54,127 --> 00:17:58,927
Yeah, it's probably for the best if you
don't, uh, tell Lisa that I stopped by,

292
00:17:58,927 --> 00:18:03,127
- Why? Is there a problem?
- Well, you know how uptight she is,

293
00:18:03,227 --> 00:18:06,227
- Really?
- I'm more the free spirit of the family,

294
00:18:07,227 --> 00:18:12,027
Oh, Oh, boy, See that right there?

295
00:18:12,027 --> 00:18:15,127
- Kirstie Alley?
- Yeah, I dated her maid,

296
00:18:16,427 --> 00:18:19,227
- Really?
- I boned Kirstie Alley's maid,

297
00:18:19,327 --> 00:18:22,127
And this is while they were
making Look Who's Talking ,

298
00:18:22,227 --> 00:18:24,027
Wow, that's really something,

299
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:26,927
I'll tell you another thing,
You know Michelle Pfeiffer?

300
00:18:27,027 --> 00:18:28,027
Yeah,

301
00:18:28,127 --> 00:18:31,127
I did the deed
with Michelle Pfeiffer's cousin,

302
00:18:31,127 --> 00:18:33,227
- Wow,
- Right out there in those bushes,

303
00:18:33,227 --> 00:18:35,627
- Right,
- Ah, she looked just like Michelle, too,

304
00:18:35,627 --> 00:18:37,727
except she was brunette
instead of blond,

305
00:18:37,727 --> 00:18:40,227
and she was kinda short and dumpy,

306
00:18:40,227 --> 00:18:43,827
Well, uh, ya certainly have
an interesting life, Fred,

307
00:18:43,927 --> 00:18:46,027
You married, Tom?

308
00:18:46,127 --> 00:18:48,727
- No, I'm single,
- No girlfriend?

309
00:18:48,827 --> 00:18:52,727
No, and, no, actually I had a girlfriend,
but we, uh, broke up,

310
00:18:52,827 --> 00:18:54,127
- Ah,
- Ah,

311
00:18:54,227 --> 00:18:58,327
Listen, I really gotta get back to work,
and since you got your TV Guide and...

312
00:18:58,327 --> 00:19:02,827
So, you broke up, huh? That's too bad,

313
00:19:02,927 --> 00:19:04,627
- Was your ex a looker?
- Yeah,

314
00:19:04,627 --> 00:19:06,827
Yeah, in my opinion she was,

315
00:19:06,927 --> 00:19:11,327
I bet you you still keep a picture
of her in your wallet,

316
00:19:11,427 --> 00:19:14,027
- Yeah, I do,
- Can I see it?

317
00:19:14,127 --> 00:19:15,727
- Yeah, I suppose,
- OK,

318
00:19:15,827 --> 00:19:18,627
Let me find her in here, There she is,

319
00:19:18,727 --> 00:19:22,627
(laughing)) Oh!
Tom, you lucky man!

320
00:19:22,627 --> 00:19:25,927
- Yeah,
- Oh, she is a real piece of ass!

321
00:19:26,027 --> 00:19:29,427
Oh, I could knock on that back door
all day long!

322
00:19:29,527 --> 00:19:32,027
- Yeah? Sh-she's a pretty girl,
- Wow,

323
00:19:32,027 --> 00:19:35,027
She has gotta be wicked in bed,
Tell me she's wicked in bed, Tom,

324
00:19:35,127 --> 00:19:37,327
I bet you she banged your johnson raw
every single night,

325
00:19:37,327 --> 00:19:39,127
- OK...
- ...'cause that is one fine-looking broad,

326
00:19:39,227 --> 00:19:40,827
All right, Hey! Would ya--

327
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:44,327
I me-- You're talking about my girlfriend,

328
00:19:44,427 --> 00:19:47,927
- Ex-girlfriend, you said,
- Yeah, but still, it's...

329
00:19:47,927 --> 00:19:51,427
Come on, I'm just making conversation,
You know, guy-talk,

330
00:19:51,527 --> 00:19:54,127
Look, I just... I don't tell comfortable

331
00:19:54,227 --> 00:19:57,927
talking about my intimate relationships
with a complete stranger,

332
00:19:58,027 --> 00:20:00,127
Understood,

333
00:20:00,227 --> 00:20:03,527
Well, you know, given how uptight
you are talking about sex,

334
00:20:03,527 --> 00:20:05,327
you pretty much
answered the question,

335
00:20:05,327 --> 00:20:07,727
I am not uptight! OK?

336
00:20:07,827 --> 00:20:11,027
Just because I don't feel like
revealing personal details

337
00:20:11,027 --> 00:20:14,927
about my ex-girlfriend's sexual habits
does not make me uptight,

338
00:20:15,027 --> 00:20:17,527
I didn't ask you anything personal,

339
00:20:17,627 --> 00:20:20,527
Well, then, what the hell
do you consider personal?

340
00:20:20,627 --> 00:20:24,227
Well, it'd be like, you know,
if I asked you how big your rod was,

341
00:20:24,327 --> 00:20:26,927
Then I would be out of line, 1 00%%%,

342
00:20:26,927 --> 00:20:31,627
No, no! That is no worse than
asking me if my girlfriend's a nymph,

343
00:20:31,727 --> 00:20:34,427
I just asked you if she dug sex,

344
00:20:34,527 --> 00:20:36,927
Besides, I wouldn't have asked
if I'd known she was frigid,

345
00:20:36,927 --> 00:20:39,527
Yeah, well, she is not frigid!

346
00:20:39,627 --> 00:20:41,527
Are you leaving?

347
00:20:41,627 --> 00:20:43,027
Oh, yeah,

348
00:20:43,127 --> 00:20:45,227
And listen, Could you do me a favor?

349
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:46,827
- It's no big deal,
- What?

350
00:20:46,927 --> 00:20:50,527
A business associate of my dad's
is gonna come by to pick this up,

351
00:20:50,527 --> 00:20:55,727
- It's frozen steaks, it's a gift,
- It's not cold,

352
00:20:57,227 --> 00:21:00,427
Dad says that's the way the guy
likes 'em, What are you gonna do?

353
00:21:00,527 --> 00:21:02,327
Will you give it to him?

354
00:21:02,427 --> 00:21:04,527
(doorbell)

355
00:21:04,627 --> 00:21:06,627
Just one second,

356
00:21:07,227 --> 00:21:09,627
(doorbell)

357
00:21:13,327 --> 00:21:14,727
- Audrey,
- Tom,

358
00:21:14,727 --> 00:21:16,227
(man)) Let's go! Come on!

359
00:21:16,227 --> 00:21:19,327
Oh, I guess this makes sense,
He's got you living with him now?

360
00:21:19,427 --> 00:21:21,727
- Uh, no, I'm just watching his place,
- (car horn))

361
00:21:21,727 --> 00:21:24,527
- He's... Jack's out of town,
- He is?

362
00:21:24,627 --> 00:21:27,327
- Yeah,
- Aw, shoot!

363
00:21:27,427 --> 00:21:29,827
I came by 'cause I was
hoping to get my job back,

364
00:21:29,927 --> 00:21:31,527
You know, the one that
you got me canned from

365
00:21:31,627 --> 00:21:33,227
'cause I made a bad cup
of coffee? Remember that?

366
00:21:33,327 --> 00:21:34,527
Listen, I'm really sorry about that,

367
00:21:34,627 --> 00:21:36,927
How can you fire someone
for making a bad cup of coffee, huh?

368
00:21:37,027 --> 00:21:38,327
I know, That's what I tried to say to him,

369
00:21:38,327 --> 00:21:41,727
I mean, who do you think you are -
Juan fucking Valdez?

370
00:21:41,827 --> 00:21:42,027
I might have had a future at that place
if you'd just give me half a chance,

371
00:21:45,127 --> 00:21:49,027
- (man)) Let's get a move on, saddlebag!
- Oh, my God, That's my idiot boyfriend,

372
00:21:49,127 --> 00:21:53,027
- (car horn))
- Hold your pants, you freakin' psycho!

373
00:21:53,127 --> 00:21:55,527
God, He drives me crazy,

374
00:21:55,627 --> 00:21:58,827
Oh, hey, you know, since you're on the
rug, would you mind putting these on?

375
00:21:58,927 --> 00:22:02,927
- They're medical... I got 'em on, too,
- Ugh! Licorice,

376
00:22:02,927 --> 00:22:06,327
I hate licorice, I need water
or I'm gonna throw up, Ugh!

377
00:22:06,327 --> 00:22:10,327
Thanks to you, I lost my second job
inside a month and now I'm flat broke,

378
00:22:10,427 --> 00:22:11,727
You lost another job?

379
00:22:11,827 --> 00:22:14,527
Yeah, I got fired from my waitress job
just last Friday,

380
00:22:14,627 --> 00:22:17,327
- Why did they fire you?
- Oh, I don't know,

381
00:22:17,327 --> 00:22:19,927
One of the assistant managers
caught me making out with a customer,

382
00:22:20,027 --> 00:22:21,627
- Excuse me?
- Well, I mean, actually the customer

383
00:22:21,727 --> 00:22:23,127
was my boyfriend,

384
00:22:23,227 --> 00:22:25,627
I mean, he became my boyfriend
after the incident anyway,

385
00:22:25,727 --> 00:22:28,527
- You got any beer in here?
- Uh... Hey,

386
00:22:28,627 --> 00:22:31,027
- Here we go,
- Would you mind putting these on?

387
00:22:31,127 --> 00:22:34,327
It's a house rule, Oh, actually,
that's a twist... Aah!

388
00:22:34,327 --> 00:22:39,127
That's the counter, Listen, Jack,
is just a real stickler, That'd be great,

389
00:22:39,227 --> 00:22:41,627
No kidding, I found that out this morning,

390
00:22:41,727 --> 00:22:43,327
(man)) I swear I am gonna freak out
and I'm gonna come in there...

391
00:22:43,427 --> 00:22:45,427
- Oh, man, Spike's in a real mood,
- Uh...

392
00:22:45,527 --> 00:22:46,827
- Don't even... hey,
- (doorbell)

393
00:22:46,827 --> 00:22:48,727
- Come on, come on, come on, Shit,
- (Spike)) I swear to God, Audrey,

394
00:22:48,727 --> 00:22:51,527
I'll piss on this guy's front steps!
Let's go!

395
00:22:51,527 --> 00:22:52,627
- (knocking))
- (doorbell)

396
00:22:52,727 --> 00:22:55,827
If you don't open this door this second,
I'm gonna come in there and...

397
00:22:55,927 --> 00:22:56,927
- Hi,
- (burps))

398
00:22:57,027 --> 00:22:58,327
- (clatter)
- Don't worry, Nothing broke,

399
00:22:58,327 --> 00:23:02,527
Hey, Baby, come on, What are you
doing leaving me in the goddamn car?

400
00:23:02,527 --> 00:23:04,127
Shake that tail, baby,
Come on, Let's get a move on,

401
00:23:04,227 --> 00:23:08,027
- Hold your horses, Try acting civilized,
- Audrey!

402
00:23:08,027 --> 00:23:09,327
This is Tom, the guy that I was
telling you about from the office,

403
00:23:09,427 --> 00:23:11,327
Oh, the coffee dude,

404
00:23:11,427 --> 00:23:14,227
You got some black ass karma
headed your way, superfreak,

405
00:23:14,327 --> 00:23:17,227
Oh, we don't need no lecture
from you, Mr, High and Mighty,

406
00:23:17,327 --> 00:23:20,527
Hey, shut that sass-trap of yours, little
lady, before I bounce you off the wall!

407
00:23:20,627 --> 00:23:24,927
Look, I would appreciate it
if you would take this outside, please,

408
00:23:25,027 --> 00:23:29,827
Hey, I'd appreciate it if you'd go
and buy yourself a bagel, Jewy,

409
00:23:29,927 --> 00:23:32,627
Jewy? I'm not Jewish, And I don't
think that making fun of the...

410
00:23:32,727 --> 00:23:36,027
- Don't pay attention to him, He's nuts,
- I'm nuts?

411
00:23:36,027 --> 00:23:38,627
- Who do you think you are?
- Look, can we please take this outside?

412
00:23:38,727 --> 00:23:40,127
Oh, come on,

413
00:23:40,227 --> 00:23:42,927
You know what you are?
You're a filthy, little tramp,

414
00:23:42,927 --> 00:23:44,427
Me? What about you and that waitress?

415
00:23:44,527 --> 00:23:46,527
- Keep going,
- I never touched her ever,

416
00:23:46,627 --> 00:23:48,527
- Swear?
- So help me God,

417
00:23:48,627 --> 00:23:50,027
You swear on your mama's life?

418
00:23:50,127 --> 00:23:52,027
Hell, woman, I ain't gonna
swear on my mama's life,

419
00:23:52,127 --> 00:23:54,927
- Why not? If you're telling the truth,
- I think he's telling the truth, Audrey,

420
00:23:55,027 --> 00:23:56,427
Then why won't you swear
on your mama's life?

421
00:23:56,427 --> 00:23:59,127
Well, because I don't feel
like I have the right

422
00:23:59,227 --> 00:24:00,727
to gamble with my mama's life,
that's why,

423
00:24:00,727 --> 00:24:03,127
Gamble? But apparently
you got nothing to worry about

424
00:24:03,227 --> 00:24:04,927
unless you're lying like
a hunk of morgue meat,

425
00:24:04,927 --> 00:24:09,427
Hey, I ain't gonna sit here and get
called a liar by no skankin' whore!

426
00:24:09,427 --> 00:24:12,727
Who you calling a whore,
you shrimp-dick bastard?!

427
00:24:12,827 --> 00:24:13,927
Audrey, see now
you're just provoking him,

428
00:24:14,027 --> 00:24:15,427
That's a vicious, flat-out,
bold-faced lie and you know it!

429
00:24:15,427 --> 00:24:18,727
- Is it? Is it? I don't think so!
- I'll whip it out right now!

430
00:24:18,727 --> 00:24:20,027
- No, no, no, I don't wanna see it,
- I'm gonna whip it out right now

431
00:24:20,127 --> 00:24:22,727
and prove to you that she's a lying slut!

432
00:24:22,827 --> 00:24:24,627
- Keep your meat in the fridge!
- You wanna see my piece?

433
00:24:24,727 --> 00:24:27,027
- All right, All right! That is enough!
- Go get me a ruler, Tom! You go get...

434
00:24:27,127 --> 00:24:30,627
That is it, I don't care
if you have a tiny shrimp dick!

435
00:24:32,427 --> 00:24:36,827
- Or a giant whale dick, which that's...
- Goddamn it, Audrey!

436
00:24:36,927 --> 00:24:39,827
You tell him you're a liar or I'm gonna
smash your face in, I swear!

437
00:24:39,927 --> 00:24:45,027
- Wait a minute! You put that down!
- All right, Can we please just use fists?

438
00:24:45,127 --> 00:24:48,027
- Come here, you little... (slap))
- You hit me, you bastard!

439
00:24:48,127 --> 00:24:50,627
- I did not and you know it!
- He hit me!

440
00:24:50,727 --> 00:24:52,727
He hit me as sure
as I'm standing right here!

441
00:24:52,827 --> 00:24:54,527
- Did you hit her, Spike?
- Yes,

442
00:24:54,527 --> 00:24:56,427
With an open hand,
It was with an open hand,

443
00:24:56,527 --> 00:24:57,827
- So what if it's open?
- You can't...

444
00:24:57,927 --> 00:24:59,327
- Then it don't count,
- Says who?

445
00:24:59,427 --> 00:25:02,327
Says anyone, Ask the Jew,

446
00:25:02,427 --> 00:25:04,827
All right, that's it,
You two have got to leave,

447
00:25:04,827 --> 00:25:07,427
All right, that's fine,
But she is not coming with me,

448
00:25:07,527 --> 00:25:08,827
You are not welcome in the double ride,

449
00:25:08,927 --> 00:25:12,327
Fine, I don't care, I don't need your lousy
trailer, I'll stay right here with Tom,

450
00:25:12,327 --> 00:25:14,027
- Fine, Stay with Tom,
- I'll stay right here,

451
00:25:14,127 --> 00:25:19,727
Wait a minute, Whoa, Guys, you need
to try to work this thing out,

452
00:25:19,827 --> 00:25:23,527
- He hit me! He knocked me on my can!
- I know, I know,

453
00:25:23,627 --> 00:25:28,227
Well, but it was with
an open hand after all, and...

454
00:25:28,227 --> 00:25:31,827
Relationships have their
ups and downs, you guys,

455
00:25:31,927 --> 00:25:33,727
and you don't want to ruin this great...

456
00:25:33,827 --> 00:25:36,827
(yelping))

457
00:25:38,927 --> 00:25:42,227
Oh, God, The bird, OJ!

458
00:25:44,627 --> 00:25:46,627
Oh, my God,

459
00:25:49,027 --> 00:25:52,627
(continues yelping))

460
00:25:52,727 --> 00:25:54,827
- (squeals))
- Oh,

461
00:25:56,327 --> 00:26:00,927
You come back here or Tom's
gonna kick your butt! So take that!

462
00:26:01,027 --> 00:26:04,027
(revs engine)) Ooh, I'm shaking
in my boots, baby!

463
00:26:04,127 --> 00:26:06,527
Look at those two, OJ,

464
00:26:06,627 --> 00:26:09,327
(phone ringing))

465
00:26:09,427 --> 00:26:14,827
(Spike)) Oh, I ain't
running away, dummy!

466
00:26:14,927 --> 00:26:17,127
- Hello?
- (Lisa)) Hi, Tom. How are ya?

467
00:26:17,227 --> 00:26:21,027
- Hey, Lisa, I'm great, I'm great,
- (squawks))

468
00:26:21,927 --> 00:26:23,627
- Is that OJ?
- Yeah, yeah.

469
00:26:23,727 --> 00:26:27,327
- We just had a little drink of water,
- I haven't heard him squawk in years,

470
00:26:27,427 --> 00:26:31,527
Oh, yeah,
He's quite the crazy bird, you know,

471
00:26:31,527 --> 00:26:34,027
Yeah. Anyway, Tom,
I just wanted you to know

472
00:26:34,127 --> 00:26:37,227
how much I appreciate
you helping me out tonight.

473
00:26:37,327 --> 00:26:40,627
But I'd like to crash at a friend's place
tonight after the party,

474
00:26:40,627 --> 00:26:43,927
Would you think it was horrible if I asked
you to stay the whole night tonight?

475
00:26:43,927 --> 00:26:49,427
Oh, well... I-I don't think your dad
would want me staying here,

476
00:26:49,527 --> 00:26:53,327
- Please?
- Yeah, I suppose I could stay,

477
00:26:53,427 --> 00:26:55,927
Thanks, Tom. I really appreciate it.
See you tomorrow. (hangs up))

478
00:26:56,027 --> 00:26:59,227
(Audrey)) I ain't afraid of you and Tom
sure as hell ain't scared neither!

479
00:26:59,327 --> 00:27:03,327
Butthead! Loser!

480
00:27:04,227 --> 00:27:05,527
(tires screeching))

481
00:27:05,527 --> 00:27:10,127
Oh, my God, Thank God he's gone,
Hey, so is it OK if I stay here tonight?

482
00:27:10,227 --> 00:27:14,027
Oh, man, it's... it's not even my house,

483
00:27:14,027 --> 00:27:16,027
Oh, yeah,

484
00:27:16,127 --> 00:27:18,427
OK, Well, I sure as hell
don't want any charity,

485
00:27:18,527 --> 00:27:22,927
I mean, it's not like you
owe me anything, so...

486
00:27:23,627 --> 00:27:25,127
And I'm sorry about
that whole office thing,

487
00:27:25,227 --> 00:27:26,627
I know that you didn't mean
to get me fired,

488
00:27:26,727 --> 00:27:31,627
- Yeah, You didn't deserve to get fired,
- Thanks,

489
00:27:31,727 --> 00:27:33,727
OK,

490
00:27:33,827 --> 00:27:37,927
Well, I guess I'll just go try
to find a homeless shelter then,

491
00:27:41,427 --> 00:27:43,427
- Wait a second,
- Yeah?

492
00:27:43,527 --> 00:27:45,327
(sighs)) God,

493
00:27:45,427 --> 00:27:51,027
- Look, I suppose you can stay,
- Really? Oh! Thanks, Tom,

494
00:27:51,127 --> 00:27:53,127
You're the best, Oh, and I'll
clean up the kitchen, OK?

495
00:27:53,227 --> 00:27:56,227
- OK,
- OK, OK,

496
00:28:09,227 --> 00:28:11,027
- (doorbell)
- (knocking))

497
00:28:11,127 --> 00:28:13,327
(Tom)) Yeah, One second,

498
00:28:13,427 --> 00:28:16,227
- (knocking))
- There's somebody at the door,

499
00:28:17,827 --> 00:28:19,927
Hi, Uh, can I help you?

500
00:28:20,027 --> 00:28:23,227
Vasquez sent me here
to pick up a package,

501
00:28:23,227 --> 00:28:26,827
Oh, you're the... Yeah, yeah, yeah,
Red told me you might be stopping by,

502
00:28:26,927 --> 00:28:28,627
Uh... Oh, hi, I'm Tom,

503
00:28:28,727 --> 00:28:31,727
What is this, Oprah ?
Just give me the goddamn package,

504
00:28:31,827 --> 00:28:35,527
Oh, OK, Yeah, Um...

505
00:28:36,327 --> 00:28:38,827
I think this is it,

506
00:28:38,927 --> 00:28:41,727
If this ain't kosher,
I'm gonna break his thumbs,

507
00:28:41,827 --> 00:28:45,727
Oh, well, by law, it should be stamped
right on the package there,

508
00:28:47,427 --> 00:28:51,227
- (. classical)
- What...

509
00:28:51,327 --> 00:28:53,927
(squawks))

510
00:28:55,527 --> 00:28:59,327
- Oh, Dinnertime, buddy,
- (. classical continues))

511
00:29:01,727 --> 00:29:07,927
OJ... today's specials include
a scrumptious buffet of mice kebabs,

512
00:29:08,027 --> 00:29:11,427
- (squawks))
- (gasps)) Aah! Shit! Ah... crap!

513
00:29:14,727 --> 00:29:16,527
You son of a bitch,

514
00:29:16,527 --> 00:29:18,427
- (squeaks))
- Ha,

515
00:29:20,127 --> 00:29:21,327
(grunts))

516
00:29:21,427 --> 00:29:24,327
- (chuckles)) I got you now, buddy,
- (squealing))

517
00:29:24,427 --> 00:29:27,527
(gasps)) Aah!

518
00:29:27,627 --> 00:29:30,727
Aah! (groans))

519
00:29:32,127 --> 00:29:34,427
(squawks))

520
00:29:34,427 --> 00:29:37,227
- Dude, that was cool,
- Oh, my God,

521
00:29:38,127 --> 00:29:41,727
- Tommy, easy on the antiques,
- (squawking))

522
00:29:41,827 --> 00:29:45,527
- Was that an owl?
- Yes, OJ got out, How is he flying?

523
00:29:45,627 --> 00:29:48,927
- Well, he is a bird,
- He... no, Jack said that he...

524
00:29:49,027 --> 00:29:51,027
Aw, shit! I gotta find him,

525
00:29:51,127 --> 00:29:54,827
Don't worry, He'll probably
come back when he's hungry,

526
00:29:54,927 --> 00:29:58,527
No, I have to find him or I'm gonna
lose my job! You know what?

527
00:29:58,627 --> 00:30:01,727
This isn't gonna help your chances
of getting your job back either,

528
00:30:01,827 --> 00:30:03,227
OK,

529
00:30:03,327 --> 00:30:06,827
- Where the hell is he?
- Tom, relax,

530
00:30:06,827 --> 00:30:09,427
- Relax? OJ's loose!
- (gasping & screaming))

531
00:30:09,427 --> 00:30:14,127
- This is no time to relax!
- Tom! He's right over here!

532
00:30:14,727 --> 00:30:16,727
- Right there, right there, right there!
- OJ!

533
00:30:16,827 --> 00:30:19,027
- Right there!
- OJ!

534
00:30:19,127 --> 00:30:23,227
Stop! No, no, Stop, Stop,

535
00:30:23,327 --> 00:30:26,527
OJ, OJ...

536
00:30:26,527 --> 00:30:30,927
Get up, What the hell you doing
on my property? Planning to rob me?

537
00:30:31,027 --> 00:30:33,427
No, I-I was just looking for...

538
00:30:33,527 --> 00:30:38,027
Yeah, yeah, I see what you're looking
for, You got a thing for young girls, eh?

539
00:30:38,027 --> 00:30:39,227
No,

540
00:30:39,327 --> 00:30:41,827
Then why do you keep
eyeing my wife, you perv?

541
00:30:41,827 --> 00:30:44,327
Your... no, I wasn't looking, l...

542
00:30:44,327 --> 00:30:47,327
Arthur, are you gonna be back soon?
I need you to spot me,

543
00:30:47,327 --> 00:30:49,127
Just give me a minute, honey,

544
00:30:49,227 --> 00:30:51,627
- Oh... Please don't kill me,
- I'm not gonna kill you, OK,

545
00:30:51,627 --> 00:30:55,927
If you let me live, I'll give you my
most valued possession, Here, take it,

546
00:30:55,927 --> 00:30:57,427
You know what that is, don't you?

547
00:30:57,527 --> 00:31:00,427
- Evander Holyfield's ear,
- What?

548
00:31:00,527 --> 00:31:04,027
The part of the ear that
Mike Tyson bit off and spit out,

549
00:31:04,127 --> 00:31:06,127
- But it's white,
- So?

550
00:31:06,227 --> 00:31:10,927
- So, shouldn't it be black?
- Well, if it's still on his head, sure,

551
00:31:11,027 --> 00:31:14,327
But anybody knows that a
severed ear loses its color,

552
00:31:14,427 --> 00:31:16,127
- No,
- Sheryl?

553
00:31:16,227 --> 00:31:18,327
- Yeah?
- What happens to an ear

554
00:31:18,427 --> 00:31:22,627
- if it's severed from your head?
- It changes color, Duh,

555
00:31:22,727 --> 00:31:25,527
- (thud)
- (Sheryl) Ow! Damn!

556
00:31:25,527 --> 00:31:27,827
- (Audrey)) Tina, give me a beer,
- (man laughs))

557
00:31:27,927 --> 00:31:29,827
- (Tina)) Oops,
- (man)) You have got to be kidding me,

558
00:31:29,827 --> 00:31:32,427
- (Audrey)) Try another one,
- (Tina)) Come on, you guys!

559
00:31:32,527 --> 00:31:34,727
- (clatter)
- (Tina)) Party!

560
00:31:34,827 --> 00:31:37,827
- Come on, let's go!
- Audrey...

561
00:31:37,927 --> 00:31:40,627
- What the hell is going on in here?
- Heads up,

562
00:31:40,727 --> 00:31:41,727
Who are these people?

563
00:31:41,827 --> 00:31:44,527
I invited some friends over
to help us look for the owl,

564
00:31:44,627 --> 00:31:46,427
And Darryl even fixed
the table in the hall,

565
00:31:46,427 --> 00:31:48,327
- Thank you,
- He won't even know it was broken,

566
00:31:48,427 --> 00:31:50,627
- (bottle breaks))
- (man)) Air ball,

567
00:31:50,727 --> 00:31:53,627
We'll get that later,
Everyone, this is Tom,

568
00:31:53,727 --> 00:31:55,527
- Yo, Tom,
- Hi, guys,

569
00:31:55,527 --> 00:31:57,027
You guys, Tom's a real good guy
and his nuts are gonna just...

570
00:31:57,027 --> 00:31:59,427
Audrey, could you...

571
00:32:00,927 --> 00:32:05,327
- What?
- Listen, I appreciate all your help,

572
00:32:05,427 --> 00:32:08,927
But could you make sure that your
friends stay out of the house?

573
00:32:09,027 --> 00:32:12,827
- All of them or just the colored guy?
- No, all of them,

574
00:32:13,427 --> 00:32:17,027
Ooh, that's smart, That way the
colored guy won't take it personal,

575
00:32:17,127 --> 00:32:20,227
- I have nothing against... Look,
- What?

576
00:32:20,327 --> 00:32:21,727
I am responsible for this house

577
00:32:21,827 --> 00:32:24,527
and I can't have all of these
people hanging around,

578
00:32:24,627 --> 00:32:28,127
OK, all right, I got it,
You guys, let's move it out,

579
00:32:28,227 --> 00:32:30,927
- Aw, I was just getting started,
- Good idea,

580
00:32:31,027 --> 00:32:33,327
Thanks, guys, That's great,

581
00:32:33,427 --> 00:32:37,027
- (Tina)) What about the cake?
- Don't worry, they're all good people,

582
00:32:37,127 --> 00:32:39,827
They're not gonna steal nothing
or drink too much like the Indians,

583
00:32:39,827 --> 00:32:43,527
Look... just make sure they stay outside,

584
00:32:43,627 --> 00:32:46,127
- OK?
- OK,

585
00:32:50,327 --> 00:32:52,827
(door opens%shuts))

586
00:32:52,927 --> 00:32:54,727
- Lisa?
- Hi, Tom,

587
00:32:54,827 --> 00:32:57,927
Uh, you're home? Why are you home?

588
00:32:58,027 --> 00:33:01,127
It's not worth going into,
I got in a huge fight with Hans,

589
00:33:01,127 --> 00:33:06,527
Oh, So... it's over?

590
00:33:07,527 --> 00:33:09,827
It's my own fault for dating
a guy my dad likes,

591
00:33:09,927 --> 00:33:10,927
Really?

592
00:33:10,927 --> 00:33:13,727
Yeah, he's one of his top marketing
execs, You know, Harvard Law,

593
00:33:13,827 --> 00:33:17,527
Comes from a good family, top
of the tennis letter at the country club,

594
00:33:17,627 --> 00:33:21,527
- Tom, can I talk to you for a second?
- Audrey?

595
00:33:21,527 --> 00:33:24,727
Yeah, She came to, uh, talk to your dad,

596
00:33:25,827 --> 00:33:29,627
OK, I'm gonna go in my room,
You could stay if you want,

597
00:33:29,627 --> 00:33:31,627
OK,

598
00:33:31,727 --> 00:33:34,427
- Tom?
- Audrey, I'll be right there, OK?

599
00:33:34,527 --> 00:33:36,127
OK,

600
00:33:36,227 --> 00:33:40,727
- Or you could go,
- You know, maybe we could talk...

601
00:33:42,027 --> 00:33:43,627
...later,

602
00:33:43,627 --> 00:33:46,927
Here, How about this one?

603
00:33:47,027 --> 00:33:49,527
- What's going on?
- We found the owl!

604
00:33:49,627 --> 00:33:52,927
- Where is he?
- Uh, well, he got away,

605
00:33:53,027 --> 00:33:55,527
- Where'd he go?
- He hopped somewhere in the bushes,

606
00:33:55,627 --> 00:33:57,827
- That's right,
- What are you doing?

607
00:33:57,827 --> 00:34:01,227
Getting hamburger meat,
That's a good way to lure birds,

608
00:34:01,327 --> 00:34:04,927
- They like hamburger meat?
- I don't know, I've never had a bird,

609
00:34:05,027 --> 00:34:07,527
- But most animals respond to meat,
- It's a fact,

610
00:34:07,627 --> 00:34:10,427
Wanna help me separate the meat?

611
00:34:11,127 --> 00:34:13,327
Speed, tell Tom about
the Kennedy assassination,

612
00:34:13,427 --> 00:34:16,127
This is so cool, Tom, 'cause Speed
knows who killed JFK,

613
00:34:16,227 --> 00:34:18,627
No, ask him! Tom, ask him,

614
00:34:18,627 --> 00:34:21,427
- Ask him who killed him,
- All right, All right,

615
00:34:21,527 --> 00:34:27,327
- Who killed JFK?
- Desi Arnaz,

616
00:34:29,027 --> 00:34:33,627
- Oh,
- His life just changed,

617
00:34:33,727 --> 00:34:35,427
(squeaking))

618
00:34:47,227 --> 00:34:48,327
Oh,

619
00:34:52,927 --> 00:34:56,627
Oh, God, Oh... oh... oh...

620
00:34:57,727 --> 00:35:00,727
- Tom!
- (gasps)) Shit, Lisa,

621
00:35:01,927 --> 00:35:04,927
- Uh, what are you doing in here?
- This is my closet,

622
00:35:05,027 --> 00:35:09,727
Oh, Oh... uh, I had
something in my pants,

623
00:35:10,327 --> 00:35:17,227
Um, I was feeding the mouse to the bird
and he, uh, ran down my pants,

624
00:35:17,927 --> 00:35:19,727
- (mice squeaks))
- I'm sorry that, uh...

625
00:35:19,727 --> 00:35:22,227
Oh, look! There it is!
That way! The bedroom,

626
00:35:24,427 --> 00:35:26,727
- (Lisa)) Whoa, Watch out!
- Aah! (groans))

627
00:35:26,827 --> 00:35:30,827
- Oh, my gosh, Are you OK?
- Yep, Yep, I'm good,

628
00:35:30,927 --> 00:35:32,927
Don't worry, we'll get it later,

629
00:35:34,827 --> 00:35:36,627
Oh, here, Let me help you,

630
00:35:36,727 --> 00:35:40,227
You know, I'm really glad you stayed,
I needed a good laugh tonight,

631
00:35:40,327 --> 00:35:43,427
Thanks, Wow, Yeah, could I make
a bigger ass out of myself?

632
00:35:43,427 --> 00:35:48,627
- (chuckling)) Do you want some wine?
- Uh, no, thanks,

633
00:35:48,627 --> 00:35:49,727
Yeah, sure,

634
00:35:49,827 --> 00:35:51,727
- Cheers,
- Cheers,

635
00:35:54,127 --> 00:35:57,127
Oh, my God, Is that signed
by Walter Payton?

636
00:35:57,227 --> 00:36:01,327
Yeah, "Sweetness", '85 Bears, Only the
greatest team ever to play the game,

637
00:36:01,427 --> 00:36:05,727

638
00:36:05,827 --> 00:36:08,027
You know what?
You may be the coolest girl ever,

639
00:36:08,127 --> 00:36:10,327
- You like football?
- Yeah, I love it,

640
00:36:10,327 --> 00:36:12,327
I didn't know you guys liked football,

641
00:36:12,327 --> 00:36:15,127
Yeah, No, me and Paul
watch the game every Sunday,

642
00:36:15,227 --> 00:36:17,127
- Paul, too?
- Yeah,

643
00:36:17,127 --> 00:36:20,027
- Oh,
- (chuckles))

644
00:36:20,027 --> 00:36:22,427
Oh, what's that?

645
00:36:22,527 --> 00:36:25,727
Oh, it's nothing,
It's just something I used to do,

646
00:36:25,827 --> 00:36:29,727
That is really good,
I didn't know you were an artist,

647
00:36:29,827 --> 00:36:33,427
I used to be, but I couldn't get any more
of my friends to pose nude for me,

648
00:36:33,527 --> 00:36:37,627
- You wouldn't be interested, would you?
- Uh...

649
00:36:37,727 --> 00:36:41,127
You're blushing, I was just joking,

650
00:36:41,227 --> 00:36:45,427
I'm not blushing, I just-l just
get red from time to time,

651
00:36:47,027 --> 00:36:48,327
You are so funny,

652
00:36:48,427 --> 00:36:51,827
No, seriously, you should really
pursue this, I mean, you're good,

653
00:36:51,927 --> 00:36:55,827
I would, but it doesn't really fit in
with my father's plan for me,

658

- Are you OK?
- Your dad's gonna kill me,

659
00:37:09,327 --> 00:37:12,227
No, don't worry about it,
It's my brother's, My dad won't care,

660
00:37:12,327 --> 00:37:13,527
Oh, Red,

661
00:37:13,627 --> 00:37:15,627
- Oh, so Dad told you?
- About what?

662
00:37:15,727 --> 00:37:18,327
- The restraining order,
- How's that?

663
00:37:18,427 --> 00:37:21,727
Yeah, Red's not allowed within
100 yards of me, my dad, or this house,

664
00:37:21,827 --> 00:37:23,827
He... uh, he didn't-he didn't mention that,

665
00:37:23,927 --> 00:37:27,427
Red's a freak, You don't want
to be around my dad if he finds out

666
00:37:27,527 --> 00:37:29,927
anyone was in this house,
especially Red,

667

It's like wherever he is, there's trouble,

668
00:37:31,727 --> 00:37:33,927
I mean, one time, he had this big party
'cause Dad was out of town

669
00:37:34,027 --> 00:37:35,327
and my dad came home early...

670
00:37:35,327 --> 00:37:39,527
Hey, uh... you know, since the mouse is
gone, what say we, uh, go back inside?

- I know! (laughing))

00:38:12,227 --> 00:38:16,527
Oh, I hated that movie!
Man, I can't believe you,

677
00:38:16,627 --> 00:38:20,327
You're like... you're so different
from how you are at work,

678

What am I gonna do? Like, walk around
with my Walter Payton jersey?

679
00:38:24,527 --> 00:38:28,627
No, no, I get it, It's, like, at work
you have to be Lisa Taylor:

to the family firm,

I swear, it's like I can just
talk to you about anything,

I know, exactly, It's...

686
00:38:49,927 --> 00:38:53,427
- Yeah, this is crazy,
- Yeah, it is,

687
00:38:54,627 --> 00:38:59,427
I guess it's because there's no
attraction between us, you know?

688
00:38:59,527 --> 00:39:00,527
Yeah,

689
00:39:00,627 --> 00:39:03,427
You know, there's none
of that sexual tension,

690
00:39:03,527 --> 00:39:05,127
- Yeah,
- It's like I'm with a girlfriend,

691
00:39:05,127 --> 00:39:07,327
- It's great, isn't it?
- Yeah,

692
00:39:07,427 --> 00:39:09,627
I mean, maybe we could go to the mall
sometime and go shopping,

693
00:39:09,727 --> 00:39:11,827
- That would be fun! Wouldn't it be fun?
- Yeah,

- Catch me,
- Oh... what?

She's so free and everything,

So, what do you think?

720

Ah, it's... it's, uh, very nice,

721
00:41:21,927 --> 00:41:25,427
So if you weren't gay,
this would turn you on, right?

722
00:41:26,227 --> 00:41:31,927
- Gay? Who said I was gay?
- My father, You mean it's not true?

723
00:41:32,027 --> 00:41:34,927
- No!
- No? God, I'm so embarrassed!

724

- I can't believe you'd let me do this!
- I didn't mean to... I mean, um...

725
00:41:38,727 --> 00:41:41,027
Why would your father say that I'm gay?

726
00:41:41,127 --> 00:41:45,727
I don't know, Well, you can't blame him
entirely, I mean, you are a little feminine,

- (gasps))
- Don't be hurt,

728
00:41:49,827 --> 00:41:52,027
It's OK,

729

Well, it's not like he did just one thing,

732
00:42:05,527 --> 00:42:07,727
It's more about trust,

733
00:42:07,827 --> 00:42:11,627
Yeah, Trust is... it's important,

I'm just sending out some kind of vibe,

- Jack Taylor,

Jack Taylor, huh? I did time
in Joliet with a Jack Taylor,

759
00:44:02,327 --> 00:44:07,227
Average height, medium hair,
horrible case of folliculitis on his ass?

760
00:44:07,327 --> 00:44:10,827
- I wouldn't know about the folliculitis,
- I thought you said he was your boss,

00:44:10,927 --> 00:44:13,927
- He is,
- And you never saw his ass?

762

- Why would I see my boss's ass?
- It stands to reason,

You work for a guy long enough,
sooner or later,

or I'm gonna call the cops!

carve you up like a turkey

bring Vasquez what he paid for

- Yeah, That's what I wanna know,

What's going on with your dad's gift?
See... Do you see that guy?

He was gonna kill me!

Don't you think you're
overreacting a little, Tom?

783
00:45:28,427 --> 00:45:33,427
Overreacting? The guy had a knife!
I don't think that I am overreacting!

784
00:45:33,427 --> 00:45:35,627
He probably just had the wrong address,

to be in this house,

00:46:15,127 --> 00:46:17,627
Give me a break, man,
You oughta be ashamed of yourself,

800
00:46:17,727 --> 00:46:20,027
Let me tell you something,
There are a lot of girls out there

801
00:46:20,127 --> 00:46:22,427
who can see past the fact
that I just happen to be...

802
00:46:22,527 --> 00:46:24,027
a few pounds overweight,

803
00:46:24,127 --> 00:46:26,527
(crying)) You know, inside
I'm just like everyone else,

804
00:46:26,627 --> 00:46:29,727
- Let me get you a tissue,
- Thank you,

805
00:46:29,727 --> 00:46:31,927
- I'm on the second day of a new diet,
- Hey, uh, Hans...

806
00:46:32,027 --> 00:46:33,827
- I gave up chocolate,
- I'm really sorry,

807
00:46:33,927 --> 00:46:36,527
I think that, uh, we just
got off on the wrong foot,

808
00:46:36,627 --> 00:46:42,027
Oh... uh... It's good
to meet you, Hans, I'm Tom,

809
00:46:42,127 --> 00:46:43,327
l, uh... (clears throat)

810
00:46:43,427 --> 00:46:46,127
I'm just a friend of Lisa's,

811
00:46:46,227 --> 00:46:49,327
Oh, great, Well, maybe you can
help me, Is she here? Lisa! Lisa!

812
00:46:49,427 --> 00:46:51,027
Whoa, Hans, you know what?

813
00:46:51,127 --> 00:46:54,027
Maybe right now isn't a great time
for you to see Lisa,

814
00:46:54,127 --> 00:46:56,227
What say, uh, we get you a drink?

815
00:46:56,327 --> 00:46:59,127
Oh, OK, Yeah, she's
probably really upset,

816
00:46:59,227 --> 00:47:03,727
You see, we got in a misunderstanding
tonight and, well, she left me,

817
00:47:03,827 --> 00:47:05,927
- Wow, that's unfortunate,
- Yeah,

818
00:47:06,027 --> 00:47:07,827
Uh, what happened?

819
00:47:07,827 --> 00:47:12,127
Well, I think seeing me naked from
behind like that kind of shocked her,

820
00:47:12,127 --> 00:47:16,127
Oh, So, tonight was the first time,

821
00:47:16,127 --> 00:47:18,927
Yeah, Tonight was the first time,
It was awesome,

822
00:47:19,027 --> 00:47:22,127
I mean, I was lying up on the bed like
this with one leg straight up in the air,

823
00:47:22,227 --> 00:47:24,127
- I don't think I really need to see...
- And I had a handful of ass right here...

824
00:47:24,127 --> 00:47:25,127
- Whoa,
- ...and I had a handful of this,

825
00:47:25,227 --> 00:47:28,827
Hans, please, Whoa,
God, you're... that's...

826
00:47:29,527 --> 00:47:33,527
- And that's when Lisa walked in,
- What?

827
00:47:33,627 --> 00:47:36,327
She caught me in the bed with a blonde,

828
00:47:36,327 --> 00:47:37,827
What?

829
00:47:37,927 --> 00:47:40,627
Aw, come on, man, Tell me you
haven't ever wanted to do it with a...

830
00:47:40,727 --> 00:47:43,827
Hans, Hans, No... you cheated on her,

831
00:47:45,527 --> 00:47:48,627
You know something, Tom?
You're right,

832
00:47:48,727 --> 00:47:53,527
Aw, I guess that was cheating,
And now I've gone and lost everyone,

833
00:47:53,527 --> 00:47:56,127
I should have known
from the start it wasn't right,

834
00:47:56,227 --> 00:47:58,727
She kept telling me
I reminded her of her dad,

835
00:47:58,727 --> 00:48:01,827
Hans, you gotta realize
that this is over, you know?

836
00:48:01,827 --> 00:48:05,427
And you gotta put an end to it,
and-and move on,

837
00:48:05,527 --> 00:48:08,927
- And get yourself to a better place, OK?
- Yes,

838
00:48:09,027 --> 00:48:13,127
- I think you know what I mean,
- Yeah, I do know what you mean,

839
00:48:13,227 --> 00:48:17,327
And I'm ready, I know what I have to do,

840
00:48:21,627 --> 00:48:23,827
Well, I guess this is good-bye,

841
00:48:27,227 --> 00:48:31,327
- (squawking))
- OJ!

842
00:48:31,427 --> 00:48:33,127
(Hans)) Thanks, Tom,

843
00:48:33,227 --> 00:48:35,127
(Tom)) OJ, come back!

844
00:48:35,727 --> 00:48:37,827
(dog barks))

845
00:48:37,927 --> 00:48:39,927
OJ!

846
00:48:42,027 --> 00:48:43,527
(squawks))

847
00:48:50,427 --> 00:48:54,027
Hello, You must be Julie's date,
Come in, Come in,

848
00:48:54,127 --> 00:48:57,527
Actually I'm just here looking for a bird,

849
00:48:57,627 --> 00:49:01,027
Make yourself at home, Albert,
Julie's still getting ready,

850
00:49:01,127 --> 00:49:04,327
- No, actually, uh, my name is Tom,
- I'm sorry, I'm hard of hearing,

851
00:49:04,427 --> 00:49:06,927
- Could you speak up, please?
- (shouts)) My name is Tom!

852
00:49:06,927 --> 00:49:09,427
I could've sworn Julie
said your name was Albert,

853
00:49:09,427 --> 00:49:11,127
No, see, I'm afraid that you're mistaken,

854
00:49:11,227 --> 00:49:15,427
- Is someone here?
- Yes, This is Julie's date, Albert,

855
00:49:15,527 --> 00:49:17,127
- Ah! Ah!
- This is my nephew, George,

856
00:49:17,227 --> 00:49:21,427
- He's blind and crippled,
- Oh, Uh... (shouts)) nice to meet you,

857
00:49:21,527 --> 00:49:22,727
I'm not deaf,

858
00:49:22,827 --> 00:49:27,427
Excuse me, I'll go see what's
keeping Julie, She's probably nervous,

859
00:49:27,527 --> 00:49:29,327
So you're Julie's date, huh?

860
00:49:29,427 --> 00:49:32,627
No, I'm just... I just came here,
I was looking for an owl,

861
00:49:32,727 --> 00:49:36,627
(laughs)) You don't have
to make lame excuses,

862
00:49:36,627 --> 00:49:40,427
Listen, do you know what the
advantage is in being a cripple?

863
00:49:40,427 --> 00:49:42,327
No, I can't say that I do,

864
00:49:42,327 --> 00:49:44,627
You don't really care to hear much
what I have to say, do you?

865
00:49:44,727 --> 00:49:47,427
No, no, It's not that, I'm...

866
00:49:48,427 --> 00:49:50,427
You know what?
Go ahead, I'm listening,

867
00:49:50,527 --> 00:49:52,727
Sit down, Tom,

868
00:49:56,727 --> 00:49:59,227
You know what I gained
by becoming a quad?

869
00:49:59,327 --> 00:50:01,327
What, are you shaking your head?
I can't see, you know!

870
00:50:01,427 --> 00:50:06,227
I'm sorry, Uh... uh...
Tell me what you gained,

871
00:50:06,327 --> 00:50:09,227
I no longer need my Viagra,

872
00:50:10,127 --> 00:50:13,627
Now I can maintain
my arousal for hours,

873
00:50:13,727 --> 00:50:16,227
That's-that's great,
I guess things have a way

874
00:50:16,327 --> 00:50:18,027
of evening themselves out
in the long run, huh?

875
00:50:18,127 --> 00:50:20,527
No, not really, And do you know why?

876
00:50:20,627 --> 00:50:21,927
No, why?

877
00:50:22,027 --> 00:50:24,427
Because I am a blind,
quad freak, you moron!

878
00:50:24,527 --> 00:50:26,527
What, you think women dig this?!

879
00:50:26,627 --> 00:50:27,827
- I mean, you think women go...
- Well, hello,

880
00:50:27,927 --> 00:50:29,827
..."l wanna give that mutant
freak my number"?

881
00:50:29,927 --> 00:50:33,227
- Ken Morehouse, I'm Julie's dad,
- Hey, nice to meet you,

882
00:50:33,327 --> 00:50:36,827
ls, uh, George boring you
with his self-pitying tripe?

883
00:50:36,827 --> 00:50:39,227
- Tripe...
- No, not at all,

884
00:50:39,227 --> 00:50:42,527
"I'm blind, I'm crippled, Boohoo-hoo,"

885
00:50:42,527 --> 00:50:45,627
Leave the room, I wanna talk
to Albert alone for a second,

886
00:50:45,727 --> 00:50:48,027
- I can stay if I want,
- Leave the room!

887
00:50:48,127 --> 00:50:49,327
- OK, OK,
- Get out!

888
00:50:49,427 --> 00:50:51,827
- You don't have to be huffy about it!
- Get out now! Get out!

889
00:50:51,827 --> 00:50:55,527
- OK,
- Turn it, turn it, turn it,

890
00:50:55,527 --> 00:50:58,527
- Oh, for God's sakes,
- (clatter)

891
00:50:58,627 --> 00:51:01,527
- I'm so sorry,
- (George)) Who the hell put that there?

892
00:51:01,627 --> 00:51:02,627
- (cat meows))
- (thud)

893
00:51:02,727 --> 00:51:06,127
My daughter's gonna be a few minutes,
Have a-Have a seat, Albert,

894
00:51:06,127 --> 00:51:07,827
- Tom,
- No, Ken,

895
00:51:07,927 --> 00:51:09,227
- Right, You're Ken,
- Yes,

896
00:51:09,327 --> 00:51:12,727
Before you say anything, Albert,
I just want you to know that Julie

897
00:51:12,727 --> 00:51:17,327
is really self-conscious about her
appearance since the... the accident,

898
00:51:17,427 --> 00:51:18,527
- (door shuts))
- Right...

899
00:51:18,527 --> 00:51:23,027
- Oh, Julie,
- Julie, this is Albert, Albert, Julie,

900
00:51:23,127 --> 00:51:26,927
- It's nice to meet you, Albert,
- Wow, It's... wow,

901
00:51:26,927 --> 00:51:32,427
It's nice to meet you, too,
But, the thing is, is that I'm not Albert,

902
00:51:34,127 --> 00:51:38,227
- That is to say that I'm not your date,
- Oh,,

903
00:51:38,227 --> 00:51:41,227
There's been a giant misunderstanding,

904
00:51:41,327 --> 00:51:44,827
- Oh, how could you?
- (crying)) I knew this would happen!

905
00:51:44,927 --> 00:51:47,127
No, I'm telling the truth,

906
00:51:47,227 --> 00:51:50,227
Julie wasn't pretty enough
for you, Mr, GQ? Is that it?

907
00:51:50,327 --> 00:51:54,827
- No, you don't understand,
- Oh, I understand, Fabio,

908
00:51:54,927 --> 00:51:57,727
- You broke that poor girl's heart,
- No, no, See, I'm not...

909
00:51:57,827 --> 00:52:01,227
Do you think Julie is an idiot? Do you
think she bought your little fairy tale

910
00:52:01,327 --> 00:52:03,927
Mr, I'm Too Sexy
for my medical booties?

911
00:52:04,727 --> 00:52:07,327
- Oh, th...
- Get the hell out of here,

912
00:52:07,427 --> 00:52:12,027
Or I'll kick your pretty-boy ass
to kingdom come,

913
00:52:12,127 --> 00:52:16,027
- Am I interrupting something?
- No, it's just that the...

914
00:52:16,127 --> 00:52:20,427
- (squawks))
- (grunts))

915
00:52:20,527 --> 00:52:23,227
Tom, there's two things
that we need to talk about,

916
00:52:23,327 --> 00:52:24,327
What?

917
00:52:24,427 --> 00:52:26,627
First of all, I don't wanna
wear these booties anymore,

918
00:52:26,727 --> 00:52:29,627
- No one else is wearing the booties,
- Fine,

919
00:52:29,727 --> 00:52:33,527
- What's the other thing?
- Tina thinks she's got cancer,

920
00:52:35,427 --> 00:52:37,627
- Do you feel it?
- Uh, I'm just...

921
00:52:37,627 --> 00:52:42,027
- What's supposed to be there? I don't...
- See, Tina?

922
00:52:42,127 --> 00:52:45,227
Move your hand to the left,
Now move it around,

923
00:52:45,327 --> 00:52:47,527
Uh-huh,

924
00:52:47,627 --> 00:52:51,327
- Don't you feel anything?
- Yeah, I mean, no, no,

925
00:52:51,327 --> 00:52:53,127
No, it seems to be... Well...

926
00:52:53,227 --> 00:52:55,827
Tina, your breast is no
different than mine, OK?

927
00:52:55,827 --> 00:53:00,927
- It is, There's no comparison,
- Tom, feel my breast and compare,

928
00:53:01,027 --> 00:53:03,827
Now, do you detect any difference
between our breasts?

929
00:53:03,827 --> 00:53:06,927
- Well... You gotta slow down a little,
- It sure feels good,

930
00:53:07,027 --> 00:53:09,627
- Well, yours is a...
- (door opens))

931
00:53:09,627 --> 00:53:12,927
- Lisa, this isn't what it looks like,
- I believed everything you said,

932
00:53:13,527 --> 00:53:14,427
I'm...

933
00:53:14,527 --> 00:53:16,027
It was all just a bunch of lines, wasn't it?

934
00:53:16,127 --> 00:53:20,227
No, no, Lisa, it was all...
I swear to you, I meant every word,

935
00:53:20,327 --> 00:53:21,727
This is... nothing's going on here,

936
00:53:21,827 --> 00:53:24,727
Great, Tom, I'm glad you think
I'm a complete idiot,

937
00:53:24,727 --> 00:53:29,627
No, no, I'm telling you, I was just
checking these girls for breast cancer,

938
00:53:30,327 --> 00:53:34,927
- You make me sick,
- No... Lisa, wait!

939
00:53:35,527 --> 00:53:38,327
- She's never gonna forgive me,
- Of course she will,

940
00:53:38,327 --> 00:53:39,527
Is this the first time you cheated on her?

941
00:53:39,627 --> 00:53:42,927
Yeah, No! I... yeah... wait,

942
00:53:43,027 --> 00:53:46,527
I didn't cheat on her, I mean,
you were there for God's sakes!

943
00:53:46,627 --> 00:53:48,127
Look, I know that
you didn't cheat on her,

944
00:53:48,227 --> 00:53:50,427
- I mean, you were a little grabby, but...
- I...

945
00:53:50,427 --> 00:53:52,027
Look, don't you think
we should just find the owl

946
00:53:52,127 --> 00:53:53,927
and worry about your little "affair" later?

947
00:53:54,027 --> 00:53:57,027
l... I am get... I'm getting angry
and I don't get angry,

948
00:53:57,127 --> 00:53:58,627
- Ugh!
- Hey, Speed?

949
00:53:58,727 --> 00:54:00,827
Hey, can I ask you a question?

950
00:54:02,027 --> 00:54:06,527
- What are you... I thought you left,
- I did... to get this,

951
00:54:07,227 --> 00:54:10,927
- All right, Why is the fire going?
- Cozy, isn't it?

952
00:54:11,027 --> 00:54:15,027
- All right, You put that down,
- Make me,

953
00:54:16,227 --> 00:54:18,227
All right,

954
00:54:20,227 --> 00:54:24,327
Hey! Hey! Put the crowbar down!

955
00:54:24,427 --> 00:54:27,927
Or I will blow your ass to fucktown!

956
00:54:39,627 --> 00:54:42,527
That's right,

957
00:54:43,927 --> 00:54:46,927
- Don't you ever threaten me,
- But... I got a gun,

958
00:54:49,127 --> 00:54:52,727
- What are you doing?
- Well, Tommy, we both have guns,

959
00:54:52,827 --> 00:54:55,527
Only difference is, you don't
have the guts to use yours,

960
00:54:55,627 --> 00:55:00,127
Oh, yeah?
Well, what makes you so sure?

961
00:55:01,627 --> 00:55:03,727
Oh, I'm sure,

962
00:55:08,327 --> 00:55:10,427
(trickling))

963
00:55:10,527 --> 00:55:16,827
Oh! Oh... Jesus! What the...
What are you, out of your mind?

964
00:55:16,827 --> 00:55:20,627
- (phone ringing))
- Stop that! Are you crazy, man?!

965
00:55:20,727 --> 00:55:22,527
(chimes))

966
00:55:22,627 --> 00:55:25,427
- Hello?
- (Taylor) Stansfield. Anything to report?

967
00:55:25,527 --> 00:55:29,227
Sir! Uh, everything's great,
I got... everything's under control,

968
00:55:29,227 --> 00:55:31,227
- Did OJ get enough water?
- (TJ)) Whoa!

969
00:55:31,327 --> 00:55:33,627
Uh, OJ... What? Oh, yes,

970
00:55:33,727 --> 00:55:37,427
Uh, Jack, could you hold on?
I'm gonna shoot your pecker off,

971
00:55:37,527 --> 00:55:40,127
I don't plan on being away
the entire weekend.

972
00:55:40,227 --> 00:55:41,327
- I hate you! I hate you!
- It's possible I may be

973
00:55:41,327 --> 00:55:45,627
coming home early, so make sure
that everything's in order.

974
00:55:45,627 --> 00:55:46,627
Jesus!

975
00:55:46,727 --> 00:55:48,527
Oh, something I forgot to tell you.

976
00:55:48,627 --> 00:55:51,627
- Sir?
- The fishtank. It's a little low.

977
00:55:51,627 --> 00:55:53,627
- I'm taking care of that right now,
- Good.

978
00:55:53,727 --> 00:55:56,427
When I get back, I want to talk to you
about that position in Creative.

979
00:55:56,527 --> 00:55:58,527
- Aah!
- Don't get excited yet.

980
00:55:58,627 --> 00:56:00,527
I didn't say you had the job.
We'll discuss it.

981
00:56:00,527 --> 00:56:03,827
Uh, thank you, sir, Uh, great, Bye,

982
00:56:05,727 --> 00:56:08,127
Holy shit!

983
00:56:11,427 --> 00:56:13,827
I just...

984
00:56:15,627 --> 00:56:19,827
Boy, I'm tapped out,
You got anything to drink?

985
00:56:19,827 --> 00:56:23,827
In the kitchen, Thanks,

986
00:56:28,327 --> 00:56:29,827
Dammit!

987
00:56:29,827 --> 00:56:35,527
Whoa! What the hay happened in here?
Tom, did you have a little accident?

988
00:56:35,627 --> 00:56:39,527
You might wanna try a few Kegels,
Kinda tighten it up down there,

989
00:56:39,627 --> 00:56:45,227
- That's it!
- I'm doing 'em right now, And release,

990
00:56:45,227 --> 00:56:49,127
Well, when in Rome...

991
00:56:49,227 --> 00:56:53,027
- (trickling))
- . Oh, Canada

992
00:57:02,527 --> 00:57:07,227
"Jack Taylor, Rectacid,
Apply liberally to buttocks as needed

993
00:57:07,327 --> 00:57:11,827
to reduce redness
and other symptoms of folliculitis,"

994
00:57:15,427 --> 00:57:17,627
Son of a bitch,

995
00:57:17,727 --> 00:57:21,927
- Did you piss yourself?
- No, I did not piss myself,

996
00:57:21,927 --> 00:57:23,427
- Looks like you did,
- Well, I didn't,

997
00:57:23,427 --> 00:57:25,527
It was that maniac downstairs,

998
00:57:25,627 --> 00:57:28,227
We gotta stop him before
he tears this house apart,

999
00:57:28,327 --> 00:57:31,427
You know what you gotta do?
Give him one of these little babies,

1000
00:57:31,527 --> 00:57:32,727
- What's that?
- It's a sleeping pill,

1001
00:57:32,827 --> 00:57:36,627
I got 'em from Speed, Here,
So strong, so be careful,

1002
00:57:36,727 --> 00:57:38,727
- It's powerful stuff,
- Here, Just one,

1003
00:57:38,827 --> 00:57:42,427
Be careful,

1004
00:57:45,927 --> 00:57:47,927
Hey, Excuse me,

1005
00:57:48,027 --> 00:57:51,627
You know, I just wanted to apologize
for pulling that gun on you earlier,

1006
00:57:51,627 --> 00:57:55,127
That was totally out of line,

1007
00:57:55,127 --> 00:57:57,627
Hey, you know, I don't
even know your name,

1008
00:57:57,627 --> 00:58:00,927
- I'm TJ,
- TJ? That's nice,

1009
00:58:00,927 --> 00:58:06,527
I guess maybe I was out of line
by pissing all over everything,

1010
00:58:06,627 --> 00:58:11,227
Man... that was funny, (laughs))

1011
00:58:11,327 --> 00:58:15,927
Yeah, I've always enjoyed a good prank,
What are you drinking there?

1012
00:58:16,027 --> 00:58:18,227
Whiskey, You want some?

1013
00:58:18,327 --> 00:58:19,727
There's plenty of booze
around here, that's for sure,

1014
00:58:19,827 --> 00:58:22,427
Yeah, I'll take a shot of bourbon,

1015
00:58:22,527 --> 00:58:25,527
- Oh, my God! Wow!
- What?

1016
00:58:25,627 --> 00:58:27,627
Whoa! Look at those
two blondes going at...

1017
00:58:27,727 --> 00:58:29,527
- Oh, wait, are there three of them?
- Where?

1018
00:58:29,627 --> 00:58:32,527
They're going at it right up there
on the second floor,

1019
00:58:32,627 --> 00:58:38,427
- Where are you looking?
- Right th... uh... Oh, man, they left,

1020
00:58:38,427 --> 00:58:40,027
(chuckles))

1021
00:58:40,127 --> 00:58:44,327
Damn, I was all psyched up
for some action,

1022
00:58:44,327 --> 00:58:47,627
Lesbians are very special,

1023
00:58:47,727 --> 00:58:51,127
Oh... Hey, I'll drink to that, huh?

1024
00:58:52,327 --> 00:58:55,327
- Cheers,
- All right,

1025
00:58:55,427 --> 00:58:57,727
Mmm,

1026
00:58:59,227 --> 00:59:00,527
- (grunts))
- Oh, are you...

1027
00:59:00,527 --> 00:59:03,227
- Whoa,
- Here, Why don't I...

1028
00:59:03,327 --> 00:59:07,827
- (glass breaks))
- Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa,

1029
00:59:07,927 --> 00:59:09,927
(steps on glass))

1030
00:59:12,527 --> 00:59:15,527
- Whoa,
- (gong))

1031
00:59:19,427 --> 00:59:23,327
- Audrey?
- (babbling))

1032
00:59:23,427 --> 00:59:26,727
Audrey!

1033
00:59:26,727 --> 00:59:31,127
(gasps)) Oh, my God!
He's like a human vibrator,

1034
00:59:31,227 --> 00:59:33,427
What... All right,
what is wrong with him?

1035
00:59:33,527 --> 00:59:36,027
- I don't know, Did you slip him the pill?
- Yes,

1036
00:59:36,027 --> 00:59:37,027
Then that must be it then,

1037
00:59:37,127 --> 00:59:39,027
You didn't give him the pill
with whiskey, did you?

1038
00:59:39,027 --> 00:59:41,027
- Yeah,
- Oh, no!

1039
00:59:41,127 --> 00:59:44,727
- You're not supposed to mix the two,
- Audrey, you did not tell me that!

1040
00:59:44,827 --> 00:59:47,327
Everyone knows that you're not
supposed to mix booze with pills!

1041
00:59:47,427 --> 00:59:50,327
- Come on!
- OK, Is he gonna be OK?

1042
00:59:50,427 --> 00:59:53,327
Don't worry, He'll be fine,
I used to be a paramedic,

1043
00:59:53,427 --> 00:59:57,227
- Tom? I think I found OJ,
- OJ? I don't care about...

1044
00:59:57,327 --> 01:00:00,027
We have a situation here,
Audrey, call 911!

1045
01:00:00,127 --> 01:00:02,927
- I'm telling ya, he'll be fine,
- Are you sure?

1046
01:00:03,027 --> 01:00:06,327
- He just needs some rest, I'm positive,
- OK, You watch TJ, Use this,

1047
01:00:06,427 --> 01:00:09,127
It's not loaded, but he doesn't know that,

1048
01:00:09,227 --> 01:00:10,727
- (doorbell)
- Oh, man!

1049
01:00:12,627 --> 01:00:15,427
- Oh, hey,
- Julie,

1050
01:00:15,427 --> 01:00:17,727
- From... yeah,
- Down the block, That's right,

1051
01:00:17,827 --> 01:00:18,927
You mind if I come in?

1052
01:00:18,927 --> 01:00:20,127
(Audrey)) All right, You grab his ankles...

1053
01:00:20,227 --> 01:00:22,227
Why don't we go
to that room over there?

1054
01:00:22,327 --> 01:00:25,927
- (Speed) OK, yeah, I got this end,
- (Audrey)) Man, he's heavy,

1055
01:00:25,927 --> 01:00:30,327
Do you mind if I sit down?

1056
01:00:30,327 --> 01:00:34,527
- Uh... yeah, Sure,
- Thank you,

1057
01:00:38,327 --> 01:00:41,727
Oh, hey, Sorry to butt in, Hi, I'm Red,

1058
01:00:41,827 --> 01:00:44,127
- Hi, it's nice to meet you,
- Nice to meet ya,

1059
01:00:44,227 --> 01:00:47,727
Anyway, I realized you were telling
the truth when my real date showed up,

1060
01:00:47,827 --> 01:00:52,327
- Of course he didn't stick around,
- Well, that guy is a bum,

1061
01:00:52,427 --> 01:00:54,427
Well, I'm sure that had
nothing to do with you,

1062
01:00:54,527 --> 01:00:55,927
No, I know it did,

1063
01:00:55,927 --> 01:00:59,727
I've never had any guys attracted to me,
even before the accident,

1064
01:00:59,827 --> 01:01:01,927
Now that cannot be true,

1065
01:01:02,027 --> 01:01:05,427
Well... about six months ago,
I was hitchhiking

1066
01:01:05,527 --> 01:01:08,527
and a trucker tried to rape me,
but other than that...

1067
01:01:08,627 --> 01:01:12,027
Come on, You're gonna tell me,
you never had a real boyfriend?

1068
01:01:12,127 --> 01:01:16,027
Well, once, but I think
he just felt sorry for me,

1069
01:01:16,127 --> 01:01:19,327
Oh, well, uh... how long did that last?

1070
01:01:19,427 --> 01:01:23,827
Um... about six years
and then one day, he just left,

1071
01:01:23,827 --> 01:01:27,727
- Another woman?
- No, He got hit by a bus,

1072
01:01:27,827 --> 01:01:29,427
(Red) Well, see that's not your fault,

1073
01:01:29,427 --> 01:01:31,927
Well, he didn't seem to try
very hard to avoid the bus,

1074
01:01:31,927 --> 01:01:34,527
I think he just wanted
out of the relationship,

1075
01:01:34,627 --> 01:01:37,227
Julie, why don't you sit in this chair?

1076
01:01:37,227 --> 01:01:39,627
Oh, geez, I'm starting
to feel a bit woozy,

1077
01:01:39,727 --> 01:01:41,827
(blood squishes))

1078
01:01:41,927 --> 01:01:45,127
OK, All right, I have to go find OJ,

1079
01:01:45,227 --> 01:01:49,727
So, Red, if you could watch things
for me, that'd be great,

1080
01:01:49,827 --> 01:01:52,927
Got ya,

1081
01:01:56,127 --> 01:01:59,627
Look, I think you're being
way too hard on yourself,

1082
01:01:59,727 --> 01:02:03,927
I mean, besides, I bet there've been a lot
of guys who've been attracted to you,

1083
01:02:04,027 --> 01:02:06,627
No, he was the only one,

1084
01:02:06,727 --> 01:02:10,427
What about that trucker? I mean,
he was obviously attracted to you,

1085
01:02:10,427 --> 01:02:13,427
(sighs)) I think the trucker probably
would have raped anyone,

1086
01:02:13,427 --> 01:02:17,227
I doubt that, You were probably
pretty special to him,

1087
01:02:17,227 --> 01:02:19,427
(chuckles)) So sweet of you, Red,

1088
01:02:19,527 --> 01:02:22,727
I'm not just jerking
your chain either, I mean it,

1089
01:02:22,727 --> 01:02:25,627
- (giggles))
- Yeah, (chuckles))

1090
01:02:29,227 --> 01:02:34,427
- What are you doing to the lawn?
- It's OK, Tom, We just had to bury TJ,

1091
01:02:34,527 --> 01:02:38,227
Bury... what? You mean, he's...

1092
01:02:39,227 --> 01:02:42,327
You said he was gonna be OK!
I thought you were a paramedic,

1093
01:02:42,427 --> 01:02:45,827
- Well, I took a course,
- You took... you-you guy...

1094
01:02:45,927 --> 01:02:47,827
You can't just bury him, you guys!

1095
01:02:47,927 --> 01:02:49,727
Well, we're not gonna put him in my car,

1096
01:02:49,827 --> 01:02:53,327
- (Audrey)) That's right,
- All right, Forget it, I'm calling 91 1 ,

1097
01:02:53,427 --> 01:02:56,227
- That's for emergencies,
- What do you think this is?

1098
01:02:56,227 --> 01:02:59,427
The guy's dead, In 20 minutes,
he's still gonna be dead,

1099
01:02:59,427 --> 01:03:01,927
- There's no sense of urgency here,
- (chuckles))

1100
01:03:01,927 --> 01:03:05,027
No, we have to call the cops
and report it!

1101
01:03:05,127 --> 01:03:10,327
- And tell 'em what?
- The truth! That there was a... accident,

1102
01:03:10,427 --> 01:03:14,827
- They might not see it that way,
- Let's face it, Tom, You did kill him,

1103
01:03:14,827 --> 01:03:18,327
- You gave me the pill,
- Hey, I didn't tell you to kill nobody, OK?

1104
01:03:18,327 --> 01:03:20,027
Well, you didn't tell me
not to use the whiskey!

1105
01:03:20,127 --> 01:03:23,227
- Well, if you'd listen to me...
- You didn't say anything about whiskey!

1106
01:03:23,327 --> 01:03:25,127
- (whistles))
- I would think you would listen to me!

1107
01:03:25,127 --> 01:03:26,627
There's no time for blame games,

1108
01:03:26,727 --> 01:03:29,427
Why don't you spread around
some leaves? Make it look good,

1109
01:03:29,527 --> 01:03:32,627
I am not gonna help
you conceal a dead body!

1110
01:03:32,627 --> 01:03:35,827
Hey, you know what? Don't you
think we should say something?

1111
01:03:35,927 --> 01:03:37,127
- What?
- You know what? She's right,

1112
01:03:37,227 --> 01:03:39,927
Some kind of last rites or eulogy
or something like that?

1113
01:03:40,027 --> 01:03:42,327
- I'm so screwed,
- We should say something,

1114
01:03:42,327 --> 01:03:48,927
Fine, fine, You know what? Say
something, Get... just make it quick,

1115
01:03:49,027 --> 01:03:55,027
Lord, this day we lay to rest TJ,
who was, uh...

1116
01:03:55,627 --> 01:03:57,627
- I really didn't know him,
- I don't know him,

1117
01:03:57,727 --> 01:03:59,527
I mean, Tom, you know him the best,
Why don't you say something?

1118
01:03:59,527 --> 01:04:01,027
- Me?
- Yeah,

1119
01:04:01,127 --> 01:04:05,627
All I know is that the guy was a violent,
sadistic goon that was into lesbians,

1120
01:04:05,727 --> 01:04:08,027
Amen,

1121
01:04:08,127 --> 01:04:11,527
- Tom?
- Lisa,

1122
01:04:11,627 --> 01:04:14,327
- I can't believe you're still here,
- Listen, please,

1123
01:04:14,427 --> 01:04:15,627
You have to let me explain,

1124
01:04:15,627 --> 01:04:19,427
Look, Tom, Tonight was just a
big mistake, That's all there is to it,

1125
01:04:19,527 --> 01:04:26,327
No, you... that... what you saw with
the girls, all that was was weird timing,

1126
01:04:26,427 --> 01:04:29,127
Red? What's Red doing here?

1127
01:04:29,227 --> 01:04:33,227
Red? Oh, uh, Red
was in the neighborhood

1128
01:04:33,227 --> 01:04:34,727
and he-and he stopped by,

1129
01:04:34,827 --> 01:04:38,027
But, you see, nothing really
bad happened tonight,

1130
01:04:38,027 --> 01:04:43,827
- Is he the reason OJ's gone?
- No, No, uh... OJ got loose,

1131
01:04:43,827 --> 01:04:46,427
And that's a little problem,
But we're gonna find him,

1132
01:04:46,527 --> 01:04:48,927
And we're looking for him, so...

1133
01:04:49,027 --> 01:04:50,427
What's this?

1134
01:04:50,527 --> 01:04:54,527
Oh, uh, Tom killed a guy
and we're burying the body,

1135
01:04:54,627 --> 01:04:56,827
- OK, that was bad,
- Aah!

1136
01:04:56,927 --> 01:05:00,027
OK, well, now you're
overreacting, It's not...

1137
01:05:00,127 --> 01:05:01,727
- Oh!
- Aah!

1138
01:05:01,827 --> 01:05:09,727
(all yelling))

1139
01:05:09,827 --> 01:05:11,527
All right, all right, hey,

1140
01:05:11,627 --> 01:05:17,227
Anybody moves, there's gonna be
a big hole where her brain used to be,

1141
01:05:19,427 --> 01:05:22,627
Yeah, Go ahead, shoot,

1142
01:05:23,527 --> 01:05:25,627
Well, what are you waiting for?
Come on!

1143
01:05:25,727 --> 01:05:27,027
What are you waiting for?!
Waste the bitch!

1144
01:05:27,127 --> 01:05:29,027
- Tom!
- No, I don't give a shit!

1145
01:05:29,127 --> 01:05:32,827
- Hey, I'm not joking, asshole,
- Yeah?

1146
01:05:32,827 --> 01:05:36,627
Pull the trigger, Come on, Come on!

1147
01:05:38,427 --> 01:05:42,227
I think you're just all talk,

1148
01:05:45,827 --> 01:05:48,727
Looks like we both got guns,

1149
01:05:50,327 --> 01:05:53,227
Who's gonna shoot first this time?

1150
01:05:56,427 --> 01:05:59,027
(chuckles))

1151
01:05:59,127 --> 01:06:01,327
(groans))

1152
01:06:01,327 --> 01:06:03,527
(Red) Well, that should do it,

1153
01:06:03,627 --> 01:06:06,627
Tom! You are so brave,

1154
01:06:06,627 --> 01:06:09,927
No, no, It's not even that big of a deal,
This gun's not even loaded...

1155
01:06:09,927 --> 01:06:11,127
- (gunshot)
- (grunt)

1156
01:06:11,227 --> 01:06:13,127
(man)) What the hell is going on?

1157
01:06:13,227 --> 01:06:16,627
I never should have doubted you,
You risked your life for me,

1158
01:06:16,727 --> 01:06:19,527
Audrey found some bullets in
the kitchen and I may have reloaded it,

1159
01:06:19,627 --> 01:06:21,627
Yeah, I did,

1160
01:06:21,727 --> 01:06:25,927
Yo, excuse me, Does anyone here
know a Jack Taylor?

1161
01:06:25,927 --> 01:06:27,327
Why?

1162
01:06:27,427 --> 01:06:31,227
This dude just called, said if I don't pick
him up at the train station in 15 minutes,

1163
01:06:31,227 --> 01:06:34,227
I'm out of a job, What do
you suppose that means?

1164
01:06:34,327 --> 01:06:35,427
Oh, my God,

1165
01:06:35,527 --> 01:06:37,527
That's what I thought,
'cause I ain't got no job,

1166
01:06:37,527 --> 01:06:39,427
- He's coming home early,
- OK, don't worry about it,

1167
01:06:39,527 --> 01:06:42,627
I'll take care of everything, OK?
Trust me, Just don't drive too fast,

1168
01:06:42,627 --> 01:06:44,027
Got it,

1169
01:06:44,027 --> 01:06:46,627
And, um, maybe you
should put that away,

1170
01:06:46,727 --> 01:06:50,127
Oh, God,

1171
01:06:50,327 --> 01:06:52,627
(. "Go Home" by Barenaked Ladies))

1172
01:07:05,127 --> 01:07:07,127
Ooh,

1173
01:07:09,727 --> 01:07:11,427
(squeaks))

1174
01:07:22,327 --> 01:07:25,127
(sighs))

1175
01:07:29,027 --> 01:07:32,027
(. whistling))

1176
01:07:40,727 --> 01:07:44,127
I knew that was you,

1177
01:08:20,627 --> 01:08:22,027
(beer bottles clank)

1178
01:09:09,627 --> 01:09:13,427
(Taylor) As long as we're in Thailand
for the meeting on Monday afternoon,

1179
01:09:13,527 --> 01:09:17,727
Yeah, We can pick it up
when we refuel in Hawaii,

1180
01:09:18,327 --> 01:09:21,227
Hey, uh, do you wanna stop
and, uh, get something to drink,

1181
01:09:21,227 --> 01:09:22,527
go to the bathroom or something?

1182
01:09:22,627 --> 01:09:24,727
We'll take the departmental heads now

1183
01:09:24,827 --> 01:09:28,127
and the Creative team
in a couple of weeks,

1184
01:09:28,227 --> 01:09:29,527
(squeaks))

1185
01:09:37,627 --> 01:09:39,727
That's the agenda up to lunch,
then there's lunch...

1186
01:09:39,827 --> 01:09:42,927
(squawking))

1187
01:09:48,627 --> 01:09:52,427
- OK, And then...
- (squawks))

1188
01:09:52,527 --> 01:09:56,127
- (horns honk)
- (tires screech))

1189
01:09:56,227 --> 01:09:59,527
OK, OK,

1190
01:10:01,027 --> 01:10:03,327
OK, fine,

1191
01:10:07,227 --> 01:10:12,027
- Stansfield, what are you doing?
- Nothing, sir,

1192
01:10:12,127 --> 01:10:14,827
Hold on a moment, please,

1193
01:10:14,927 --> 01:10:19,827
Stansfield... why don't you
just concentrate on the driving

1194
01:10:19,827 --> 01:10:22,827
and let me get on with making my call,

1195
01:10:22,827 --> 01:10:25,527
- Wait!
- What is it now, Stansfield?

1196
01:10:25,627 --> 01:10:30,027
Oh, nothing, sir, Almost home,

1197
01:10:48,227 --> 01:10:52,527
- Hey, How'd this get in there?
- Oh, be careful with that,

1198
01:10:52,627 --> 01:10:54,527
I will, Good thing I found it,

1199
01:10:54,527 --> 01:10:57,527
There's several ways to properly
dispose of a handgun,

1200
01:10:57,627 --> 01:11:00,127
none of which include
putting it in a garbage bag,

1201
01:11:00,127 --> 01:11:03,227
(cop over megaphone))
Freeze! Police! Freeze!

1202
01:11:03,327 --> 01:11:05,227
Let go of the girl
and put your hands in the air!

1203
01:11:05,327 --> 01:11:07,127
You're completely surrounded, TJ!

1204
01:11:07,127 --> 01:11:09,727
Put down your weapons
and put your hands on you head!

1205
01:11:09,727 --> 01:11:15,127
No, you guys, Wait, He's not TJ,
I'm Lisa Taylor, This is my dad's house,

1206
01:11:15,227 --> 01:11:17,127
Ma'am, we've received
numerous reports

1207
01:11:17,127 --> 01:11:18,627
from this neighborhood: theft, gunfire...

1208
01:11:18,627 --> 01:11:22,927
All right, Look, I know you probably
think we may have killed somebody,

1209
01:11:22,927 --> 01:11:24,727
but Tom didn't know
he poisoned the guy,

1210
01:11:24,727 --> 01:11:28,727
and we thought he was dead when
we buried him, But he seems OK now,

1211
01:11:28,727 --> 01:11:32,227
His head's just a little bloody
from where we hit him with the shovel,

1212
01:11:32,227 --> 01:11:35,327
And I swear when Tom shot the gun off,
he didn't think it was loaded

1213
01:11:35,427 --> 01:11:38,827
'cause I put the bullets back in,
so if you'll all just step inside,

1214
01:11:38,827 --> 01:11:41,027
you'll see there's nobody dead here,

1215
01:11:41,127 --> 01:11:43,027
He may have had the wind
knocked out of him temporarily,

1216
01:11:43,127 --> 01:11:45,627
but with a little first aid,
I think he'll be just fine,

1217
01:11:45,727 --> 01:11:48,227
(screaming))

1218
01:11:48,327 --> 01:11:50,127
(screaming))

1219
01:11:50,127 --> 01:11:55,427
- (screams))
- (screams))

1220
01:11:55,427 --> 01:11:57,527
Holy mother of God!

1221
01:11:59,927 --> 01:12:01,327
(Lisa)) Hans!

1222
01:12:01,427 --> 01:12:03,627
Yes, I see, I see,

1223
01:12:03,727 --> 01:12:05,727
- (squeaks))
- OK, fine,

1224
01:12:05,827 --> 01:12:07,027
- (squawking))
- Whoa!

1225
01:12:07,127 --> 01:12:09,627
Could you say that again?
You're breaking up!

1226
01:12:09,727 --> 01:12:14,927
One moment, please, OJ!

1227
01:12:15,027 --> 01:12:16,827
(tires screeching))

1228
01:12:24,227 --> 01:12:29,127
I just can't understand why you would
do this, Hans, what were you thinking?

1229
01:12:29,127 --> 01:12:31,527
He'll be fine, He may complain
about a sore throat,

1230
01:12:31,627 --> 01:12:34,227
but he's in a lot better shape
than this chandelier,

1231
01:12:34,327 --> 01:12:35,727
Well, I'd hate to be here
when the owner gets back,

1232
01:12:36,527 --> 01:12:38,627
You can say that again,

1233
01:12:38,727 --> 01:12:40,227
- (man)) Whoa!
- (car horn))

1234
01:12:42,827 --> 01:12:44,227
- Tom! Daddy!
- What do we got?

1235
01:12:44,227 --> 01:12:46,427
- What was that?
- Watch the glass, OK, everybody?

1236
01:12:46,527 --> 01:12:48,527
- Let's get 'em out of the car,
- Oh, my God! Daddy!

1237
01:12:48,627 --> 01:12:50,827
- Everybody, stay back and remain calm,
- (Lisa)) Are you all right?

1238
01:12:50,827 --> 01:12:53,127
That's him, That's the one spying
on me through the bushes,

1239
01:12:53,227 --> 01:12:55,327
He shot the bullet right through
my Julie's bedroom window,

1240
01:12:55,427 --> 01:12:58,527
Here, Tell 'em, Julie,

1241
01:12:59,227 --> 01:13:01,927
You guys, Tom wants the body in here,

1242
01:13:02,027 --> 01:13:04,527
- (TJ)) Take it easy, Put me down,
- (gasps))

1243
01:13:05,827 --> 01:13:09,327
Stansfield, what have you done?

1244
01:13:09,427 --> 01:13:13,027
Lisa, pack your things,
You're coming with me to Thailand,

1245
01:13:14,427 --> 01:13:17,527
No!

1246
01:13:19,927 --> 01:13:22,327
Get his ass out of here,

1247
01:13:22,427 --> 01:13:26,427
It's funny you should mention
the word "ass", Jack,

1248
01:13:26,427 --> 01:13:29,527
Why don't we start
by talking about yours,

1249
01:13:29,527 --> 01:13:30,527
Excuse me?

1250
01:13:30,627 --> 01:13:34,727
Lisa, your father is not
who you think he is,

1251
01:13:34,727 --> 01:13:39,527
The whole publishing operation,
It's a great cover,

1252
01:13:39,527 --> 01:13:43,527
Now how'd you do it? What'd you do?
Did you hollow out the books?

1253
01:13:43,527 --> 01:13:48,027
Oh, and locating the plant
in Thailand, It's genius!

1254
01:13:49,327 --> 01:13:53,327
- What are you talking about?
- What am l... Jack,

1255
01:13:53,427 --> 01:13:58,127
You know, I-I would've believed
you, Jack... until I met this man,

1256
01:13:58,227 --> 01:14:00,427
who seems to know a lot about ya,

1257
01:14:02,327 --> 01:14:07,727
Recognize this? I hear it's very
effective in relieving folliculitis,

1258
01:14:07,827 --> 01:14:11,027
I don't have folliculitis,

1259
01:14:11,027 --> 01:14:14,727
He's given me no choice,

1260
01:14:14,727 --> 01:14:16,627
- He's given me no choice!
- Tom, what are you doing?

1261
01:14:16,727 --> 01:14:19,427
- This is insane!
- Yeah? Take a look at your dad's ass,

1262
01:14:19,427 --> 01:14:21,227
- No!
- Then tell me I'm insane, huh?

1263
01:14:21,327 --> 01:14:25,827
- (all) Oh! Ooh!
- Huh? Huh? Look at it!

1264
01:14:25,827 --> 01:14:28,427
Look at it! Huh? Huh?

1265
01:14:28,527 --> 01:14:30,427
- Ooh...
- What?

1266
01:14:35,227 --> 01:14:37,227
(man)) Oh, that's nasty,

1267
01:14:42,627 --> 01:14:48,127
I told you I don't have folliculitis,
you blithering idiot,

1268
01:14:48,227 --> 01:14:53,927
Well, guys, the ointment
must have worked,

1269
01:14:54,027 --> 01:14:56,127
Let's go,

1270
01:14:56,227 --> 01:15:00,527
Wait! I have something to show ya,

1271
01:15:02,327 --> 01:15:04,527
(all) Oh!

1272
01:15:04,527 --> 01:15:05,827
(Hans)) What's with this movie
and the ass cheeks?

1273
01:15:05,827 --> 01:15:11,127
My real name is Jack Taylor... Jr,
Red is my nickname,

1274
01:15:11,227 --> 01:15:15,127
Now you know why,
I'm the whole reason that TJ's here,

1275
01:15:15,227 --> 01:15:19,327
Goddamn it, Red, You've been
dealing drugs out of my house!

1276
01:15:19,427 --> 01:15:23,427
No, Dad, I swear,
I gave this guy a bag of flour,

1277
01:15:23,527 --> 01:15:26,827
I dumped a kilo of the real stuff
down the toilet,

1278
01:15:26,927 --> 01:15:29,027
I'm finished dealing for good,

1279
01:15:29,127 --> 01:15:32,227
The lime green toilet
with the wooden seat?

1280
01:15:33,027 --> 01:15:35,427
- Yeah, why?
- (squawking))

1281
01:15:35,527 --> 01:15:46,327
(all) Ooh!

1282
01:15:46,327 --> 01:15:48,027
(all) Whoa!

1283
01:15:48,027 --> 01:15:52,827
Wait a second, He's flying,

1284
01:15:52,827 --> 01:15:55,727
He's flying,

1285
01:15:59,627 --> 01:16:01,927
(squawking))

1286
01:16:03,327 --> 01:16:06,527
(all) Whoa!

1287
01:16:09,527 --> 01:16:10,727
- (OJ squeals))
- (car horn))

1288
01:16:10,827 --> 01:16:14,327
- (tires screeching))
- (crash))

1289
01:16:15,327 --> 01:16:21,027
Get him out of my sight, Now,
Lisa, let's go,

1290
01:16:23,227 --> 01:16:25,827
That's the one, He got my ear!
Evander Holyfield's ear,

1291
01:16:25,927 --> 01:16:28,627
You have to right to remain silent,
Anything you say can and...

1292
01:16:28,727 --> 01:16:30,527
Lisa, wait!

1293
01:16:30,627 --> 01:16:33,327
(Arthur) That's Holyfield's ear
for God's sake,

1294
01:16:33,427 --> 01:16:36,327
(thunder rolling))

1295
01:16:53,827 --> 01:16:57,627
- (squawking))
- OJ?

1296
01:16:59,227 --> 01:17:04,527
OJ! Come to Daddy,
How's my little boy?

1297
01:17:06,627 --> 01:17:09,827
(squawking))

1298
01:17:17,827 --> 01:17:24,427
- You're going with him?
- What choice do I have? He needs me,

1299
01:17:24,427 --> 01:17:27,127
Are you actually feeling sorry for him?

1300
01:17:27,127 --> 01:17:30,727
He's manipulating you
and you are buying it,

1301
01:17:31,627 --> 01:17:35,427
All right, fine, You do what you gotta do,
I am gonna bail Tom out of jail,

1302
01:17:35,527 --> 01:17:36,627
With what? Your drug money?

1303
01:17:36,727 --> 01:17:38,727
No, no, no, I stole this out of Dad's safe,

1304
01:17:38,827 --> 01:17:41,827
Look, the important thing is,
somebody has gotta help Tom,

1305
01:17:41,927 --> 01:17:45,627
You know that nothing that happened
here last night was any of his fault,

1306
01:17:45,627 --> 01:17:50,127
It's funny, The nicest guy in the world's
the only one with enough balls

1307
01:17:50,227 --> 01:17:52,527
to stand up to Dad,

1308
01:17:55,827 --> 01:18:00,127
All he wanted to do was
to spend some time with you,

1309
01:18:00,127 --> 01:18:02,327
Look what it gets him,

1310
01:18:02,427 --> 01:18:07,227
Classic Dad, I'm not allowed in the
house, you're not allowed out of it,

1311
01:18:07,327 --> 01:18:10,727
He doesn't care about us,
Only that stupid bird,

1312
01:18:12,127 --> 01:18:15,827
- Hey, Red, can I tell you something?
- Sure,

1313
01:18:15,927 --> 01:18:20,427
I know this is gonna sound weird,
but ever since I was a little kid...

1314
01:18:22,627 --> 01:18:27,427
I used to always wish
that I was that stupid bird,

1315
01:18:28,627 --> 01:18:30,427
Aw,

1316
01:18:30,527 --> 01:18:34,027
(squawks))

1317
01:18:37,627 --> 01:18:41,127
Look, I think it's about time
you talk to Dad,

1318
01:18:41,227 --> 01:18:45,027
At least tell him how you feel,
You can do it,

1319
01:18:45,027 --> 01:18:46,427
(grunts))

1320
01:18:46,527 --> 01:18:49,427
(yells))

1321
01:18:49,427 --> 01:18:53,127
Don't you see, we have no reason
to be afraid of him?

1322
01:18:53,227 --> 01:18:55,327
- Aah!
- (screaming))

1323
01:18:55,427 --> 01:18:57,327
Aah!

1324
01:18:58,627 --> 01:19:06,027
(grunting)) Aah!

1325
01:19:06,027 --> 01:19:07,227
- (yells))
- (thud)

1326
01:19:07,227 --> 01:19:12,027
- Daddy!
- Lisa, don't let him do this to you,

1327
01:19:12,127 --> 01:19:16,327
Lisa! Aah!

1328
01:19:36,827 --> 01:19:40,027
- Lisa!
- Tom!

1329
01:19:40,127 --> 01:19:43,827
Red bailed me out... and told me you
were here and I'm not letting you go,

1330
01:19:43,927 --> 01:19:46,427
- Yeah, but I'm...
- No, You're gonna let me finish,

1331
01:19:46,527 --> 01:19:49,927
I went through hell last night and it was
my fault 'cause I let people do it to me,

1332
01:19:50,027 --> 01:19:51,727
And now you're gonna
make the same mistake,

1333
01:19:51,827 --> 01:19:53,527
- Yeah, but...
- This isn't what you want,

1334
01:19:53,627 --> 01:19:56,627
This is what your father wants,
And you know what?

1335
01:19:56,727 --> 01:20:02,827
Maybe you and l... never
are gonna work, And that hurts,

1336
01:20:02,827 --> 01:20:07,127
But not as much as watching you
be controlled by a ruthless tyrant

1337
01:20:07,127 --> 01:20:09,727
that would screw his own mother
if he thought it'd help him get ahead...

1338
01:20:09,827 --> 01:20:21,227
Tom! I'm not going,

1339
01:20:21,327 --> 01:20:23,327
She's-she's not going,

1340
01:20:26,527 --> 01:20:30,527
Is this whole concept too complicated
for you, Stansfield?

1341
01:20:40,827 --> 01:20:44,927
No, No,

1342
01:20:45,027 --> 01:20:47,627
All right, (chuckles))

1343
01:20:47,727 --> 01:20:51,027
Wha... I... What made you stay?

1344
01:20:59,127 --> 01:21:01,127
That,

1345
01:21:07,927 --> 01:21:13,927
- How did you guys...
- We finally had our long overdue talk,

1346
01:21:14,727 --> 01:21:17,627
Then-then who's taking
your place in Thailand?

1347
01:21:17,727 --> 01:21:19,327
- He is,
- (gong))

1348
01:21:19,427 --> 01:21:20,727
- What's this?
- (neck cracks)) Ow!

1349
01:21:20,827 --> 01:21:24,027
- I'm kidding,
- I don't wanna go, I'm afraid,

1350
01:21:24,127 --> 01:21:27,127
Nonsense, Everyone knows that, uh...

1351
01:21:27,227 --> 01:21:30,527
Asian people are very
intimidated by, uh...

1352
01:21:30,627 --> 01:21:32,627
- Tall men?
- Canadians?

1353
01:21:32,727 --> 01:21:35,427
- Republicans?
- Blacks?

1354
01:21:35,527 --> 01:21:37,327
- Henderson?
- Yes, sir,

1355
01:21:37,427 --> 01:21:39,127
I won't have that kind of thinking
in this company,

1356
01:21:39,127 --> 01:21:42,027
There's no room for racism here,
You're fired,

1357
01:21:42,127 --> 01:21:46,827
Now, Tom, the point that I'm getting to
is that with a big part of the team away,

1358
01:21:46,927 --> 01:21:49,727
I'm gonna want you to take over
the Creative Department,

1359
01:21:49,727 --> 01:21:52,027
- Me?
- No need to be modest,

1360
01:21:52,027 --> 01:21:55,127
I saw those ideas you left
in the living room,

1361
01:21:55,227 --> 01:22:00,027
Your theory on the JFK thing, brilliant,
And the moon landing, a hoax?

1362
01:22:00,027 --> 01:22:02,127
You're really on to something there,

1363
01:22:02,227 --> 01:22:06,227
That's the kind of thinking
that's gonna sell books,

1364
01:22:06,327 --> 01:22:10,227
Uh, thank you, sir,

1365
01:22:10,327 --> 01:22:13,927
Bye, Daddy, Have a safe flight,

1366
01:22:17,427 --> 01:22:21,927
Well, Dad... that's fantastic,
You promoted Tom,

1367
01:22:22,027 --> 01:22:25,527
Yeah, well, I figure anyone who's got
the guts to piss on my Persian carpet

1368
01:22:25,627 --> 01:22:30,427
has gotta have what it takes,
Stansfield!

1369
01:22:30,427 --> 01:22:33,827
(trickling))

1370
01:22:35,827 --> 01:22:41,127
- What the hell are you doing?
- Just trying to get my job back, sir,

(. "If I Had $ 1000000"

1372
01:22:43,327 --> 01:22:46,027
- (Lisa squeals))
- (chuckles))

1373
01:22:46,127 --> 01:22:50,127
(Tom)) You know, after everything
that happened, after all I went through,

1374
01:22:50,127 --> 01:22:54,127
I guess it was my lucky day.
And I'm not the only one.

1375
01:22:54,127 --> 01:22:56,227
Based on Lisa and Red's suggestions,

1376
01:22:56,327 --> 01:22:58,927
Jack restructured the company
from top to bottom.

1377
01:22:58,927 --> 01:23:02,627
Even instituting casual
Fridays every day.

1378
01:23:02,627 --> 01:23:05,927
And last Friday was Henderson's
27th straight day on the job

1379
01:23:05,927 --> 01:23:07,427
without being fired.

1380
01:23:07,527 --> 01:23:10,527
OJ's back off the drugs
and now he only drinks beer.

1381
01:23:10,627 --> 01:23:12,627
(burps))

1382
01:23:12,627 --> 01:23:15,327
(chuckles)) But he still has
an occasional flashback.

1383
01:23:15,427 --> 01:23:17,927
(squawks))

1384
01:23:18,027 --> 01:23:20,527
Jack begged Audrey to come back,
but she got a job

1385
01:23:20,527 --> 01:23:22,527
at, of all places, a coffee shop.

1386
01:23:22,627 --> 01:23:24,927
- Ew!
- Ugh!

1387
01:23:26,727 --> 01:23:28,727
- Ew!
- Ew!

1388
01:23:28,827 --> 01:23:31,627
This is terrible!

1389
01:23:31,627 --> 01:23:35,327
Hans succeeded in turning around
the company's factory in Thailand.

1390
01:23:35,327 --> 01:23:37,827
But apparently he's still struggling
to cope with the local customs.

1391
01:23:37,927 --> 01:23:40,327
- Back of bus!
- Excuse me?

1392
01:23:40,327 --> 01:23:43,727
- You people belong back of bus,
- That's an outrage!

1393
01:23:43,827 --> 01:23:46,727
Man, I'm not gonna let you treat me
like that merely because I'm...

1394
01:23:46,727 --> 01:23:49,627
Smoking! Smokers belong back of bus!

1395
01:23:49,727 --> 01:23:52,627
(coughing))

1396
01:23:52,727 --> 01:23:54,927
As for me, with my new promotion,

1397
01:23:55,027 --> 01:23:58,027
I could at last write books
based on my own experiences.

1398
01:23:58,027 --> 01:23:59,527
- So I did.
- Thank you,

1399
01:23:59,527 --> 01:24:03,327
And Lisa was finally able to pursue
a career that she loved.

1400
01:24:03,427 --> 01:24:06,227
You know, you ever heard
someone say that old expression.:

1401
01:24:06,327 --> 01:24:09,527
"Why does everything bad
always happen to me?"

1402
01:24:09,627 --> 01:24:13,627
Well, I don't get those people...
'cause I've learned that if they just stop

1403
01:24:13,627 --> 01:24:20,427
and look around, they'd realize
that everything happens for a reason.

1404

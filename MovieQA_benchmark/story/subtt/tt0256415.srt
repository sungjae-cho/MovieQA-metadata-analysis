00:00:28,573 --> 00:00:31,994
...Come on, Jake.
...Slow down!

...Hurry up, Jake!
...Melanie!

5
00:00:35,163 --> 00:00:38,542
I gotta get home.
My mom's gonna kill me.

6
00:00:38,625 --> 00:00:40,127
Wow, did you see that?

7
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:43,797
1,001... 1,002...

8
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:46,258
...Well, answer the question!
...No!

9
00:00:46,341 --> 00:00:49,177
No, you won't answer,
or no, you won't marry me?

10
00:00:49,261 --> 00:00:50,971
Jake Perry,
I'm 10 years old.

11
00:00:51,013 --> 00:00:52,806
I got too much to live for.

12
00:00:52,889 --> 00:00:54,850
...[Lightning crashes]
...Ahh!

13
00:00:54,891 --> 00:00:59,146
Not that way, you dolt!
Come on!

14
00:01:04,192 --> 00:01:06,194
...Wow!
...Cool!

15
00:01:06,236 --> 00:01:08,238
It's hot.
Don't touch it.

16
00:01:08,322 --> 00:01:10,198
We'll be safe here.

17
00:01:10,282 --> 00:01:11,533
Says who?

18
00:01:11,617 --> 00:01:12,826
Everybody.

19
00:01:12,909 --> 00:01:17,998
Lightning never strikes
the same place twice.

20
00:01:19,833 --> 00:01:22,127
Why would you want to
marry me for anyhow?

21
00:01:23,211 --> 00:01:25,505
So I can kiss you
any time I want.

I need more coffee, guys.

25
00:02:01,249 --> 00:02:03,085
I'm gonna switch...
It's a warning!

26
00:02:03,168 --> 00:02:05,379
Oh, my God.

27
00:02:08,674 --> 00:02:10,717
...Hey.
...Hi.

28
00:02:12,469 --> 00:02:13,804
You know,
that accent of yours

29
00:02:13,887 --> 00:02:15,430
is a whole lot thicker
when you're dreaming.

30
00:02:15,514 --> 00:02:17,224
...[Laughter]
...[Sighs]

31
00:02:17,307 --> 00:02:19,226
All right, how come
y'all let me sleep?

32
00:02:19,268 --> 00:02:21,061
Oh, calm down.
It was 5 minutes.

33
00:02:21,103 --> 00:02:22,896
What did I say?

34
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:25,440
We're all getting big, fat
raises when you become somebody.

35
00:02:25,524 --> 00:02:26,942
[Light laughter]

36
00:02:26,984 --> 00:02:29,736
Oh, did they kill
Badgley Mishka!

37
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:31,905
Okay, laugh now, but
tomorrow it could be us.

38
00:02:31,989 --> 00:02:34,783
Not us... you.
I just make the coffee.

39
00:02:34,866 --> 00:02:36,535
Thank you.

40
00:02:41,331 --> 00:02:44,793

[Breathes deeply]
Andrew!

59
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:04,539
There's a rose for every moment
I thought of you last night.

60
00:04:04,623 --> 00:04:05,958
God, you must be exhausted.

61
00:04:06,041 --> 00:04:08,502
Listen, knock 'em dead.
I'll see you at the show.

...It's gonna be great.

63

# Weekend come...
it's your song, song, song #

69
00:04:22,933 --> 00:04:26,186
Okay, people,
we are officially late!

70
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:27,521
Pan: Melanie!

71
00:04:27,604 --> 00:04:28,563
Yes?!

72
00:04:28,647 --> 00:04:30,899
This top is supposed
to be neon aubergine,

73
00:04:30,983 --> 00:04:33,026
but it's all wrong!
It's all wrong!

74
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:34,987
Okay, don't panic.
That's my job.

75
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:36,947
Um... okay.
Put her on after Anoke.

76
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:39,700
The third light cue is yellow.
She'll look eggplant.

77
00:04:39,783 --> 00:04:43,078
Pan, uh, the reason it's all
wrong is it's on backwards.

78
00:04:43,161 --> 00:04:45,080
[Effeminately] Ooh,
Miss Vixen, I'm scared of you.

79
00:04:45,163 --> 00:04:48,208
Frederick, what are you doing
here? You're the competition.

80
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:51,211
Competition? Please! Our
design's for plumes and pearls,

81
00:04:51,253 --> 00:04:53,964
and nothing is going to come
between me and my protege.

82
00:04:54,047 --> 00:04:56,216
And this is, after all,
all about me.

83
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:59,595
Oh, I love this. Stella
McCartney's gonna kill herself.

84
00:04:59,678 --> 00:05:02,514
Then why do I feel like
I'm in Times Square buck naked?

85
00:05:02,598 --> 00:05:04,474
Baby doll, you're
gonna be just fine.

86
00:05:04,558 --> 00:05:07,227
Seven years ago, you were this
debutante off the plantation,

87
00:05:07,269 --> 00:05:09,521
and now you're
my steel magnolia...

88
00:05:09,605 --> 00:05:10,897
with her very own show.

89
00:05:10,981 --> 00:05:13,358
Okay, get out of here
before you make me cry.

90
00:05:14,484 --> 00:05:15,694
Bonne chance!

91
00:05:20,449 --> 00:05:23,160
Big smile!
Great! Thank you!

# The waves keep on crashin'
on me for some reason #

93
00:05:26,955 --> 00:05:28,123
Good to see you.

94
00:05:28,206 --> 00:05:29,958
Secretary Hennings,

95
00:05:30,042 --> 00:05:31,710
do you have a moment
for a few questions?

96
00:05:31,793 --> 00:05:34,046
Andrew, are you excited
about the show?

97
00:05:34,129 --> 00:05:36,131
Uh, of course,
I'm very excited.

98
00:05:36,214 --> 00:05:38,258
Did you get to
see the models?

99
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:39,676
The models? Why, uh...

100
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,803
Please tell me
he has a flaw somewhere.

101
00:05:41,887 --> 00:05:45,265
He asked me to go to
Ireland for Christmas.

102
00:05:45,307 --> 00:05:48,352
He's gonna ask you
a lot more than that.

103
00:05:48,435 --> 00:05:50,479
...You think so?
...Mm-hmm.

104
00:05:50,562 --> 00:05:52,022
...Hey, let's go!
...Let's do this!

105
00:05:52,105 --> 00:05:54,816
All right, we gotta go.
Places, everyone!

106
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:56,485
...Come on, let's go, line up.
...Have a good show.

107
00:05:56,568 --> 00:05:59,488
Okay, no smiles,
no smiles, just smirks!

108
00:05:59,571 --> 00:06:02,157
# Keep on dancin' #

109
00:06:05,202 --> 00:06:08,747
# You hold me like you should,
so I'm gonna keep on dancin' #

110
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:12,584
# Keep on dancin' #

111
00:06:19,675 --> 00:06:20,634
Ohh!

112
00:06:20,717 --> 00:06:22,469
Honey!

113
00:06:22,511 --> 00:06:24,304
...[Shrieks]
...Oh, congratulations.

114
00:06:24,346 --> 00:06:27,140
You're amazing.
Those flowers were insane.

115
00:06:27,224 --> 00:06:29,017
Oh, well, I just want
this day to be perfect.

116
00:06:29,101 --> 00:06:30,686
[Sighs] Oh, God, honey,
what if they hate me?

117
00:06:30,769 --> 00:06:32,813
Oh, they're critics, Mel.
They hate themselves.

118
00:06:32,896 --> 00:06:34,147
That's easy for you to say.

119
00:06:34,231 --> 00:06:35,857
I wasn't born with
that thick Hennings skin.

120
00:06:35,941 --> 00:06:38,819
No, you weren't, and that
is what I love about you.

121
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:40,279
Mmm.

122
00:06:40,362 --> 00:06:42,281
Ah, honey, I'm sorry, I got
a meeting in the Bronx.

123
00:06:42,364 --> 00:06:44,783
But you go and enjoy, and
I'll see you later. Okay?

124
00:06:44,866 --> 00:06:47,452
Oh, and, hey, we've got that
thing tonight at Lincoln Center.

125
00:06:47,536 --> 00:06:49,121
What thing?

126
00:06:49,204 --> 00:06:50,747
Fund-raiser thing.

127
00:06:50,831 --> 00:06:54,167
[Sighs] Right, the thing...
with your mother.

128
00:06:54,251 --> 00:06:55,544
That's tonight.

129
00:06:55,627 --> 00:06:56,837
I'm afraid so.

130
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:57,879
Okay.

131
00:06:57,921 --> 00:07:00,382
I am so proud of you.

132
00:07:00,424 --> 00:07:02,843
Thank you.

133
00:07:02,884 --> 00:07:03,969
...Okay?
...I love you.

134
00:07:04,052 --> 00:07:05,679
I love you, too.
Congratulations.

135
00:07:09,433 --> 00:07:11,184
[Horn honks]

136
00:07:25,115 --> 00:07:26,658
His meeting's running
a little late.

137
00:07:26,742 --> 00:07:29,411
He told me to take you inside
so you wouldn't have to wait.

138
00:07:29,494 --> 00:07:30,746
Where are we?

139
00:07:32,331 --> 00:07:34,916
[Horn honks]

140
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,002
...I'm so tired, Jimmy.
...Yeah.

141
00:07:37,085 --> 00:07:38,420
I've just had it.

142
00:07:38,503 --> 00:07:41,882
Well... he shouldn't be
too long.

143
00:07:41,924 --> 00:07:44,760
Miss Carmichael,
won't you come in?

144
00:07:53,602 --> 00:07:56,688
So... have you made a decision?

145
00:07:56,772 --> 00:07:57,940
A-bout what?

146
00:07:58,023 --> 00:07:59,274
Ireland.

147
00:07:59,358 --> 00:08:03,403
Ireland, honey, [Scoffs]
that's four months from now.

148
00:08:03,779 --> 00:08:05,530
I was thinking maybe
2... 300 guests, tops.

149
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:07,741
I was thinking maybe
2... 300 guests, tops.

150
00:08:07,824 --> 00:08:09,284
For Christmas?

151
00:08:09,368 --> 00:08:12,913
Andrew, are you on
some sort of medication?

152
00:08:12,955 --> 00:08:16,583
What's going on?
Where are we?

153
00:08:35,644 --> 00:08:39,147
[Gasps] Oh, my God.

154
00:08:39,231 --> 00:08:42,442
O-Oh, my God.

155
00:08:47,239 --> 00:08:49,825
Oh, my God.

156
00:08:49,908 --> 00:08:52,286
Melanie Carmichael...

157
00:08:52,327 --> 00:08:54,454
will you marry me?

158
00:08:56,248 --> 00:08:57,666
Are you sure?

159
00:08:57,749 --> 00:09:00,335
I mean, a-a-are
you really sure?

160
00:09:00,419 --> 00:09:02,337
Because if you're not sure, we
could just go back to the car.

161
00:09:02,421 --> 00:09:04,006
...Mel, Mel, Mel, Mel...
...It's only been 8 months.

162
00:09:04,089 --> 00:09:05,882
You know I never do
anything rash.

163
00:09:05,966 --> 00:09:07,926
And I usually never
ask a question

164
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:09,678
I don't already know
the answer to,

165
00:09:09,761 --> 00:09:14,349
so... at the risk of
being rejected twice,

166
00:09:14,433 --> 00:09:16,351
I'm gonna ask you again.

167
00:09:20,063 --> 00:09:22,190
Will you marry me?

168
00:09:24,484 --> 00:09:26,194
Yes!

169
00:09:26,278 --> 00:09:28,196
Yes! Yes!

170
00:09:28,238 --> 00:09:29,197
[Both laugh]

171
00:09:29,239 --> 00:09:29,906
Yes!

172
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:35,996
Pick one.

173
00:09:52,262 --> 00:09:53,555
Mayor, just one shot!
One shot!

174
00:09:53,639 --> 00:09:55,098
Can you comment on
the Watson bill?

175
00:09:55,182 --> 00:09:56,600
Over here, Mayor, please!
Over here!

176
00:09:56,683 --> 00:09:59,227
Thank you.
Where is he?

177
00:09:59,311 --> 00:10:00,520
He's running late.

178
00:10:00,604 --> 00:10:02,272
No doubt thanks to
that Carbuncle girl.

179
00:10:02,356 --> 00:10:03,732
Carmichael...
designer, Southern.

180
00:10:03,815 --> 00:10:04,983
Right, whatever.

181
00:10:05,067 --> 00:10:06,693
Right here, Mayor!

182
00:10:06,777 --> 00:10:08,278
...Please, Mayor!
...Miss Mayor, over here!

183
00:10:08,362 --> 00:10:09,738
Your Honor,
how do you answer those

184
00:10:09,821 --> 00:10:11,698
who are opposed to
the street-improvement project

185
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:13,325
you put before
the city council today?

186
00:10:13,408 --> 00:10:16,244
I suggest they take a drive on
some of the streets in Brooklyn.

187
00:10:16,328 --> 00:10:19,206
Maybe they'll disappear
into a pothole.

188
00:10:19,247 --> 00:10:21,833
Your son's relationship
with Melanie Carmichael...

189
00:10:21,917 --> 00:10:24,419
sources say they're engaged.
Do you have a comment?

190
00:10:24,503 --> 00:10:28,382
Trust me, if my son were
engaged, I'd have a comment.

191
00:10:30,759 --> 00:10:32,427
I thought you were tired.

192
00:10:32,511 --> 00:10:35,180
Jimmy, can you excuse us
for a second?

193
00:10:35,264 --> 00:10:36,348
[Chuckles]

194
00:10:38,433 --> 00:10:40,018
I've been planning
this for weeks.

195
00:10:40,102 --> 00:10:43,105
I knew your show would be great,
and tonight is perfect.

196
00:10:43,188 --> 00:10:46,149
Oh, God, I can't wait to see
the look on my mother's face.

197
00:10:46,233 --> 00:10:48,235
Come on,
let's call your parents.

198
00:10:48,318 --> 00:10:49,444
No!

199
00:10:49,528 --> 00:10:50,821
l-I mean...
[Chuckles nervously]

200
00:10:50,904 --> 00:10:52,698
n-not right this second.

201
00:10:54,032 --> 00:10:55,075
What I mean is, uh...

202
00:10:55,158 --> 00:10:56,743
Honey, would you
mind terribly

203
00:10:56,827 --> 00:10:59,288
if we just kept this to
ourselves for a few days?

204
00:10:59,329 --> 00:11:02,582
Mel, it's gonna come out
sooner or later.

205
00:11:02,624 --> 00:11:04,668
No, l-I know,
I know, but, um,

206
00:11:04,751 --> 00:11:07,170
it's just, I haven't seen
my folks in about 7 years,

207
00:11:07,254 --> 00:11:11,633
and I just feel like I should
probably tell them in person.

208
00:11:11,675 --> 00:11:12,968
Of course.

209
00:11:14,511 --> 00:11:18,640
And, um... l-I think
I should do it alone.

210
00:11:18,724 --> 00:11:21,435
Mel, I'm gonna have to
meet them eventually.

211
00:11:21,476 --> 00:11:24,146
l-I know, I know, and
they will love you...

212
00:11:24,229 --> 00:11:25,314
eventually.

213
00:11:27,899 --> 00:11:29,818
Is it because
I'm a Yankee?

214
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:32,863
Well, that...
and a Democrat.

215
00:11:37,326 --> 00:11:39,453
Okay... mum's the word.

216
00:11:39,536 --> 00:11:41,913
...No one will know.
...Thank you.

217
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:48,587
Secretary Hennings,
will you comment...

218
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:50,589
Secretary Hennings...

219
00:11:50,672 --> 00:11:52,132
Okay. [Laughs]

220
00:11:52,174 --> 00:11:53,550
Hello.

221
00:11:56,678 --> 00:11:58,847
Why haven't you told your
mother you're engaged?

222
00:11:58,931 --> 00:12:00,474
Have you thought
about children?

223
00:12:01,642 --> 00:12:03,518
I'm sorry we're late.

224
00:12:03,602 --> 00:12:06,313
That shade of lipstick does
nothing for you. What kept you?

225
00:12:06,355 --> 00:12:07,856
Oh, it's none of your business.

226
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:09,983
Ah, you know I hate surprises.
What's going on?

227
00:12:10,025 --> 00:12:12,527
Oh, Tom, always a pleasure.
Good to see you.

228
00:12:12,569 --> 00:12:14,321
...Melanie, darling.
...Hi, Your Honor.

229
00:12:14,363 --> 00:12:15,656
So good to see you.

230
00:12:15,697 --> 00:12:18,283
Look at you... always
the belle of the ball.

231
00:12:18,367 --> 00:12:20,327
I hear very good things
about your new line.

232
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:22,079
Oh, yeah. Thanks.

233
00:12:22,162 --> 00:12:23,956
Always a pleasure.

234
00:12:26,708 --> 00:12:29,002
Um...

235
00:12:29,086 --> 00:12:30,837
...Andrew?
...Yes?

236
00:12:30,921 --> 00:12:32,172
Seems Melanie is wearing
a skating rink

237
00:12:32,214 --> 00:12:33,757
on a very important finger.

238
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:36,802
Um, Your Honor, I'd
really like to keep it...

239
00:12:36,885 --> 00:12:39,304
Oh, my God,
you're engaged?!

240
00:12:39,388 --> 00:12:41,682
[Indistinct shouting]

241
00:12:41,765 --> 00:12:42,975
Quiet.

242
00:12:58,156 --> 00:13:00,867
Tabatha: Bloody hell, Mel,
I'm your first New York friend,

243
00:13:00,909 --> 00:13:03,537
and I have to read about it
with 12 million other people!

244
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:05,580
Sorry, honey,
she just grabbed my hand.

245
00:13:05,664 --> 00:13:06,915
What was I supposed to do?

246
00:13:06,999 --> 00:13:08,417
I know...
we read all about it.

247
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,210
...So, did you cry?
...Wouldn't you?

248
00:13:10,294 --> 00:13:12,713
One man for the rest of my life?
I'd bawl my bloody eyes out.

249
00:13:12,754 --> 00:13:15,257
So why don't you meet us?
We're just around the corner.

250
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:17,759
[Sighs] Can't.

251
00:13:17,801 --> 00:13:20,095
I'm in Alabama.

252
00:13:20,178 --> 00:13:23,890
Oh... my God.

253
00:13:25,684 --> 00:13:26,685
Yeah.

254
00:14:21,156 --> 00:14:23,492
[Birds chirping]

255
00:14:25,827 --> 00:14:27,162
[Barks]

256
00:14:29,331 --> 00:14:31,667
[Barks]

257
00:14:34,002 --> 00:14:38,882
[Barking slowly]

258
00:14:46,223 --> 00:14:48,767
Aw, he's loud,
but he don't bite.

259
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:50,310
Come on, shut up, hound!

260
00:14:50,394 --> 00:14:51,436
Lie down.

261
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:53,689
Go on, stay.

262
00:14:53,772 --> 00:14:56,024
Now, how can I help you?

263
00:14:56,108 --> 00:14:59,194
Well, for starters, you can get
your stubborn ass down here

264
00:14:59,278 --> 00:15:00,696
and give me a divorce.

265
00:15:03,407 --> 00:15:05,701
...[Thud]
...[Groans]

266
00:15:05,784 --> 00:15:07,452
[Sighs] Come on,
Jake, I mean it.

267
00:15:07,536 --> 00:15:08,870
The joke's over.

268
00:15:08,954 --> 00:15:10,831
Let's just finish this.
I've got a plane to catch.

269
00:15:14,334 --> 00:15:16,128
You're shittin' me, right?

270
00:15:16,211 --> 00:15:18,714
You know, I've never actually
understood that expression,

271
00:15:18,797 --> 00:15:20,716
but, no,
I'm not "shitting" you.

272
00:15:20,757 --> 00:15:24,177
Look, it's even got
these idiot-proof tabs

273
00:15:24,219 --> 00:15:25,345
to make it easy.

274
00:15:25,387 --> 00:15:27,598
There's one copy for me,
one copy for you,

275
00:15:27,681 --> 00:15:29,391
and one copy
for the lawyers.

276
00:15:29,474 --> 00:15:32,519
[Exhales sharply]

277
00:15:34,771 --> 00:15:36,023
What? Speak!

278
00:15:36,064 --> 00:15:37,024
[Slow barking resumes]

279
00:15:37,065 --> 00:15:40,694
You show up here
after 7 years

280
00:15:40,736 --> 00:15:44,197
without so much as a "Hey,
there, Jake, remember me...

281
00:15:44,239 --> 00:15:46,408
your wife?"

282
00:15:46,491 --> 00:15:49,536
Or a "Hi, honey.
Lookin' good.

283
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:51,580
How's the family?"

284
00:15:51,663 --> 00:15:53,498
You expect me to tell you
you look good?

285
00:15:53,582 --> 00:15:55,918
Did they run out of soap down at
the Piggly Wiggly since I left?

286
00:15:56,001 --> 00:15:57,044
[Slow barking continues]

287
00:15:57,127 --> 00:15:59,838
They laugh at that up north
or wherever it is you been?

288
00:15:59,922 --> 00:16:01,548
You knew where I was.

289
00:16:01,632 --> 00:16:03,926
And don't even pretend you spent
all this time missing me.

290
00:16:04,009 --> 00:16:05,761
Oh, I missed you,
all right.

291
00:16:05,844 --> 00:16:08,513
But at this range,
my aim is bound to improve.

292
00:16:08,597 --> 00:16:10,557
Is that a threat?

293
00:16:10,641 --> 00:16:13,060
I've got a lawyer
who charges $350 an hour.

294
00:16:13,101 --> 00:16:15,896
He billed me every time
you sent these papers back.

295
00:16:15,938 --> 00:16:17,940
Well, I'm glad to see
you finally got the message.

296
00:16:17,981 --> 00:16:19,858
...Shut up, Bear!
...Shut up, Bryant!

297
00:16:19,942 --> 00:16:22,736
[Barks, groans]

298
00:16:22,778 --> 00:16:25,614
What happened to Bear?

299
00:16:25,697 --> 00:16:28,200
He died.

300
00:16:28,283 --> 00:16:29,868
You weren't here.

301
00:16:31,286 --> 00:16:32,704
What are you doing?!

302
00:16:32,788 --> 00:16:34,164
Leavin'. You done it.

303
00:16:34,247 --> 00:16:36,583
You should recognize
the gesture.

304
00:16:36,625 --> 00:16:39,920
Could we just try to keep this
as civilized as possible?

305
00:16:39,962 --> 00:16:42,547
Please sign these papers
so I can go home.

306
00:16:42,631 --> 00:16:44,258
What do you know from home?

307
00:16:44,341 --> 00:16:47,302
Hell, I bet your folks don't
even know you're in town.

308
00:16:47,344 --> 00:16:48,929
That's my business.

309
00:16:49,012 --> 00:16:52,140
Honey, those people are
the only family you got.

310
00:16:52,224 --> 00:16:53,558
Don't you "honey" me,
honey!

311
00:16:53,642 --> 00:16:56,770
Get your butt back in that car,
you drive over and see 'em,

312
00:16:56,853 --> 00:16:59,439
and then maybe we'll talk.

313
00:16:59,523 --> 00:17:00,649
[Screen door slams]

314
00:17:00,732 --> 00:17:03,527
Jake! You dumb, stubborn,
redneck hick!

315
00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:05,862
The only reason you
won't sign these papers

316
00:17:05,946 --> 00:17:07,155
is 'cause I want you to!

317
00:17:07,239 --> 00:17:09,283
Wrong! The only reason
I ain't signin'

318
00:17:09,366 --> 00:17:13,453
is 'cause you've turned into
some hoity-toity Yankee bitch,

319
00:17:13,537 --> 00:17:17,082
and I'd like nothin' better
right now than to piss you off!

Unh!

00:17:30,846 --> 00:17:33,765
What are you doin' with
Mose Plydell's plane anyhow?!

323
00:17:33,849 --> 00:17:34,975
That's my business!

324
00:17:35,017 --> 00:17:37,144
...Fine!
...Fine!

[Sighs]

330
00:18:14,890 --> 00:18:17,100
Next time you lock somebody out,

331
00:18:17,184 --> 00:18:20,187
make sure they don't know
where the spare key's hidden.

332
00:18:20,228 --> 00:18:24,191
Well, see, that's the thing
about Hide-A-Keys...

333
00:18:24,232 --> 00:18:28,195
it'd be nice if your wife
told you where it was!

334
00:18:28,236 --> 00:18:30,364
I'm not your wife, Jake.

335
00:18:30,405 --> 00:18:33,283
I'm just the first girl

336
00:18:33,367 --> 00:18:35,369
that climbed
in the back of your truck.

337
00:18:37,079 --> 00:18:41,041
But you're right...
I have changed.

338
00:18:41,083 --> 00:18:43,669
I don't even know
that girl anymore.

339

allow me to remind you.

00:19:24,876 --> 00:19:27,629
Why would my son
do this to me?

349
00:19:27,713 --> 00:19:29,673
Maybe he, um, loves her.

350
00:19:29,756 --> 00:19:30,799
Oh, please!

351
00:19:30,882 --> 00:19:32,801
This is classic rebound.

352
00:19:32,884 --> 00:19:35,470
He's still wounded from...
who was his last girlfriend?

353
00:19:35,554 --> 00:19:38,265
Whitney Truesdale,
lawyer, San Francisco.

354
00:19:38,348 --> 00:19:40,684
Yeah, well, there was
a match made in Heaven...

355
00:19:40,767 --> 00:19:45,022
society, political family,
California...

356
00:19:45,105 --> 00:19:47,441
all those electoral votes.

357
00:19:47,524 --> 00:19:49,776
Get Andrew on the phone.

358
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:53,322
Since we have a small window
for the Secretary of Housing,

359
00:19:53,405 --> 00:19:55,907
please hold your questions
until after the presentation.

360
00:19:55,991 --> 00:19:57,451
Gentlemen.

361
00:19:57,492 --> 00:19:59,161
Did you see the look
on my mom's face?

362
00:19:59,244 --> 00:20:00,829
I thought her head
was going to explode.

363
00:20:00,912 --> 00:20:02,205
Yeah, what did she say?

364
00:20:02,289 --> 00:20:04,166
That I should date women
like Melanie, not marry them.

365
00:20:04,249 --> 00:20:06,793
...That's harsh.
...That's Mom.

366
00:20:06,877 --> 00:20:08,378
...Thank you.
...Thanks a lot.

367
00:20:08,462 --> 00:20:10,213
We hope to have
the Bronx Children's Hospital

368
00:20:10,297 --> 00:20:12,174
...open by fall 2003.
...[Cellphone ringing]

369
00:20:12,257 --> 00:20:14,593
Oh, speak of the devil.
Hello?

370
00:20:14,676 --> 00:20:17,346
So, have you two lovebirds
set a date?

371
00:20:17,429 --> 00:20:18,889
I'm pleading the Fifth.

372
00:20:18,972 --> 00:20:21,183
Okay, fine, just try to keep
your secrets. I dare you.

373
00:20:21,266 --> 00:20:23,185
Oh, at least you sound like
you're in a better mood.

374
00:20:23,268 --> 00:20:25,062
My approval rating
went up 2 points.

375
00:20:25,145 --> 00:20:27,689
It seems the public likes
being reminded I am a mother.

376
00:20:27,773 --> 00:20:29,191
God, always running for office.

377
00:20:29,274 --> 00:20:32,486
I'm only thinking of you.
Say, um...

378
00:20:32,527 --> 00:20:35,155
do you happen to have
the Carmichaels' number

379
00:20:35,197 --> 00:20:37,491
down there in Greenville?

380
00:20:37,532 --> 00:20:40,327
I thought perhaps
I should introduce myself.

381
00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:42,496
I would like to meet them first,
if you don't mind.

382
00:20:42,579 --> 00:20:45,332
You do realize the press
is going to be all over this.

383
00:20:45,415 --> 00:20:47,167
Happy couples don't sell.

384
00:20:47,209 --> 00:20:50,754
So if there are any skeletons
in her closet, Andrew,

385
00:20:50,837 --> 00:20:52,714
we need to know about them.

386
00:20:52,798 --> 00:20:55,801
[Indistinct talking
on police radio]

387
00:20:57,261 --> 00:20:58,887
You make clothes, right?

388
00:20:58,971 --> 00:21:01,723
I design them.
There's a big difference.

389
00:21:01,807 --> 00:21:04,226
Did you design anything
with stripes?

390
00:21:04,268 --> 00:21:07,187
...[Knock on door]
...You called the sheriff?!

391
00:21:07,229 --> 00:21:10,857
You know that old bastard
hates me!

392
00:21:10,899 --> 00:21:12,484
For good reason!

393
00:21:12,567 --> 00:21:16,989
Well, hell's bells, if
it ain't Felony Melanie.

394
00:21:17,072 --> 00:21:19,157
Wade!

395
00:21:19,241 --> 00:21:23,370
Hot damn, girl,
do we miss you around here!

396
00:21:23,453 --> 00:21:25,872
Hey, I think I saw poor, old
Fuzz just the other day.

397
00:21:25,914 --> 00:21:27,582
Oh, God,
you had to bring that up.

398
00:21:27,666 --> 00:21:29,376
I can't believe
you're the sheriff!

399
00:21:29,418 --> 00:21:31,420
Yep, I get to frisk pretty
little things like you all day

400
00:21:31,461 --> 00:21:33,005
and get paid for it.

401
00:21:33,088 --> 00:21:34,923
Wade, can you try and be
a little more professional?

402
00:21:35,007 --> 00:21:36,508
We got us a crime suspect here.

403
00:21:36,592 --> 00:21:39,678
Now, Melanie, you can't just go
breaking into people's houses.

404
00:21:39,761 --> 00:21:42,764
I didn't break in, Wade.
I used a key...

405
00:21:42,848 --> 00:21:44,016
my key.

406
00:21:46,059 --> 00:21:47,769
Well, it still ain't
your house, darlin'.

407
00:21:47,853 --> 00:21:49,271
I'm gonna have to
escort you out.

408
00:21:49,354 --> 00:21:51,106
Use the cuffs, Wade, please?

409
00:21:51,189 --> 00:21:54,359
If you get him to sign these,
I'll let you run me out of town.

410
00:21:54,443 --> 00:21:55,569
Now, that's none
of your concern.

411
00:21:55,611 --> 00:21:57,195
Well, what do we got here?

412
00:22:00,115 --> 00:22:03,035
...A bill of divorcement?
...Mm-hmm.

413
00:22:03,118 --> 00:22:05,120
Hell, boy, I thought you said
you took care of this.

414
00:22:05,203 --> 00:22:06,455
And I thought I had.

415
00:22:06,538 --> 00:22:07,914
Obviously not.

416
00:22:07,998 --> 00:22:10,250
Well, if you two are still
married, it's her house, too.

417
00:22:10,292 --> 00:22:12,920
This here ain't nothin'
but a domestic dispute.

418
00:22:12,961 --> 00:22:14,755
He didn't hit you, did he?

419
00:22:14,796 --> 00:22:17,799
If he took a swing at you,
I'll take him in right now.

420
00:22:17,841 --> 00:22:19,927
We take that stuff
pretty serious nowadays.

421
00:22:24,306 --> 00:22:27,309
No, Wade,
Jake's never hit me.

422
00:22:27,392 --> 00:22:29,603
You know what?

423
00:22:29,645 --> 00:22:31,980
I don't have a single
childhood memory

424
00:22:32,064 --> 00:22:34,107
that doesn't have
you two in it.

425
00:22:34,149 --> 00:22:37,152
And that includes the night
I lit my ass on fire. Remember?

426
00:22:37,194 --> 00:22:38,111
Wade...

427
00:22:38,195 --> 00:22:41,073
Memory Lane is closed.

428
00:22:41,156 --> 00:22:44,785
Ah, boy, you two got a whole lot
of catchin' up to do...

429
00:22:44,826 --> 00:22:46,745
so I'm just gonna
leave you to it.

430
00:22:46,828 --> 00:22:48,580
Man, I set you up with
your wife. You owe me one!

431
00:22:48,664 --> 00:22:49,957
Why won't you just
sign the papers?!

432
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:51,458
Hey, there is
nothin' I can do.

433
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:55,671
The law is the law,
and she has done nothin' wrong.

434
00:22:55,754 --> 00:22:58,257
I suppose shoplifting steaks
at Winn-Dixie's okay.

435
00:22:58,340 --> 00:23:00,968
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!

436
00:23:01,051 --> 00:23:02,636
I took 'em back,
and you know it!

437
00:23:02,719 --> 00:23:06,014
You remember that vandalism out
at the stockyard? Totally her!

438
00:23:06,098 --> 00:23:08,308
Like I could tip a cow
by myself.

439
00:23:08,350 --> 00:23:09,643
Hmm.

440
00:23:09,726 --> 00:23:13,438
Wade... isn't there
some outstanding warrant

441
00:23:13,522 --> 00:23:16,191
for whoever dumped your mama's
tractor in the fishpond?

442
00:23:16,275 --> 00:23:17,276
[Gasps]

443
00:23:17,359 --> 00:23:19,820
[Sighs deeply]

444
00:23:23,282 --> 00:23:25,325
We only have 10 of these, and
it's gonna be gone for good.

445
00:23:25,409 --> 00:23:27,536
So if you are loving
this monster...

446
00:23:27,619 --> 00:23:30,330
...[Snoring]
...[Telephone rings]

447
00:23:30,414 --> 00:23:31,999
We have eight only?

448
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:34,251
If I knew how to say that in
Italian, I would, but I don't.

449
00:23:34,334 --> 00:23:35,961
Um, if you love this...

450
00:23:36,044 --> 00:23:39,172
9: 15? Honestly.

451
00:23:39,256 --> 00:23:41,174
Who could be callin'
at this hour?

452
00:23:41,883 --> 00:23:43,510
Hello?

453
00:23:43,594 --> 00:23:45,220
Hel-lo?

454
00:23:45,304 --> 00:23:47,347
Melanie: Hey, Mama.

455
00:23:47,431 --> 00:23:49,558
Melanie? Is that you?

456
00:23:49,641 --> 00:23:51,602
Oh, it's so late.
Are you all right?

457
00:23:51,685 --> 00:23:54,646
I, uh... um...

458
00:23:54,730 --> 00:23:56,648
I just thought
I'd surprise you.

459
00:23:56,732 --> 00:24:00,152
Well, this certainly is a fine
surprise, hearing from you...

460
00:24:00,235 --> 00:24:02,738
you know,
being such a busy girl and all.

461
00:24:02,821 --> 00:24:04,489
Of course, I call people

462
00:24:04,573 --> 00:24:07,659
while I'm doin' the dishes
or shellin' peas.

463
00:24:07,743 --> 00:24:10,746
Oprah calls it
"multitasking."

464
00:24:10,829 --> 00:24:13,498
Mama, the call
isn't the surprise.

465
00:24:13,582 --> 00:24:14,666
l-I'm in town.

466
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:17,044
Oh, Lord, love a duck!
Ha!

467
00:24:17,127 --> 00:24:20,380
Oh, my baby girl
has finally come home.

468
00:24:20,422 --> 00:24:22,090
Earl, she's in town.

469
00:24:22,174 --> 00:24:23,967
Earl: You gonna repeat
everything she says?

470
00:24:24,051 --> 00:24:26,219
...If you are, get off my chair.
...Mama...

471
00:24:26,303 --> 00:24:27,971
I'm just sittin' here, is all.

472
00:24:28,055 --> 00:24:29,389
What happened to the sound?

473
00:24:29,473 --> 00:24:31,975
I turned it down
so I could hear the phone ring.

474
00:24:32,059 --> 00:24:34,227
...Mama!
...What, are you a clairvoyant?

475
00:24:34,311 --> 00:24:36,355
It was so loud,
I couldn't hear myself think.

476
00:24:36,438 --> 00:24:39,691
...Mama...
...They could have heard it
at Joe and Lurlynn's house.

477
00:24:39,775 --> 00:24:41,526
...Hello?
...I only get 3 minutes.

478
00:24:41,610 --> 00:24:44,738
Oh, honey, you didn't need
to call, then. Just come on by.

479
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:46,907
Uh... well, that's the thing.

480
00:24:46,990 --> 00:24:50,369
I was sorta hoping
Daddy could come get me.

481
00:24:53,455 --> 00:24:56,291
Earl: So, what put you
in jail this time?

482
00:24:56,375 --> 00:24:59,294
Melanie: Jake and
his big, fat mouth.

483
00:24:59,336 --> 00:25:02,422
It's just a misunderstanding,
that's all.

484
00:25:02,464 --> 00:25:04,549
Yeah, kinda like that
weddin' I paid for, huh?

485
00:25:04,633 --> 00:25:06,885
I would hardly call that
a wedding.

486
00:25:06,969 --> 00:25:08,262
Boy was nervous.

487
00:25:08,303 --> 00:25:11,556
He was still drunk
from the night before.

488
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,058
Can you blame him?

489
00:25:13,141 --> 00:25:14,977
Yes, I can!

490
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:17,229
I went to the reception
by myself with puke

491
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:20,315
all down my dress while he slept
it off in the Travelodge,

492
00:25:20,399 --> 00:25:22,276
and you're still
siding with that...

493
00:25:22,317 --> 00:25:24,361
I'm not sidin' with anybody.

494
00:25:24,444 --> 00:25:25,529
...[Sighs]
...[Sighs]

495
00:25:25,612 --> 00:25:26,780
The boy's changed, is all.

496
00:25:26,863 --> 00:25:29,032
Can we just
not talk about Jake, okay?

497
00:25:29,116 --> 00:25:31,785
l-I know he's the son you never
had, but I'm your only daughter,

498
00:25:31,868 --> 00:25:34,955
and maybe you want to know
what's new with me.

499
00:25:34,997 --> 00:25:38,166
[Sighs] Okay, shoot.

500
00:25:38,250 --> 00:25:41,878
I met somebody...

501
00:25:41,962 --> 00:25:45,257
and he's quite a catch.

502
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:48,594
H-He's really a great guy.

503
00:25:48,677 --> 00:25:51,805
And I'm happy... really.

504
00:25:55,851 --> 00:25:57,811
Come to Mama, sugar!

505
00:25:59,771 --> 00:26:01,273
Hey, Mama.

506
00:26:01,356 --> 00:26:05,360
Oh, good land of the livin',
you are skin and bones.

507
00:26:07,195 --> 00:26:09,448
Well, don't I get a smile?

508
00:26:09,531 --> 00:26:11,617
I know you got one
in there somewhere.

509
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:14,494
Come on, come on, let's not
let all the bought air out.

510
00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:22,836
Well, are you hungry, sweetie?

511
00:26:22,878 --> 00:26:25,213
Do you want me to reheat you
some chicken-fried steak?

512
00:26:25,297 --> 00:26:26,798
Oh, no, Mama, I'm fine.

513
00:26:26,882 --> 00:26:28,175
Sweetie, you look tired.

514
00:26:28,258 --> 00:26:30,218
Are you tired?
Oh, you know what?

515
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:33,013
Maybe it's the way
you're wearing your hair now.

516
00:26:34,723 --> 00:26:35,891
[Sighs]

00:34:18,228 --> 00:34:20,689
Where is the Hide-A-Key?!

688
00:34:20,772 --> 00:34:24,985
I had the sweetest chat with
Wade's mama about her tractor.

689
00:34:26,945 --> 00:34:29,156
Nice to see you got
your accent back.

690
00:34:29,239 --> 00:34:32,701
Oh, I stumbled across
a few things today.

691
00:34:32,743 --> 00:34:33,869
Holy shit!

692
00:34:33,952 --> 00:34:36,038
What happened to the stove?!

693
00:34:36,121 --> 00:34:38,957
Oh, and where are
them little magnets

694
00:34:39,041 --> 00:34:41,460
I had over here, huh?!

695
00:34:45,255 --> 00:34:47,966
What the hell is this...
chick food?

696
00:34:48,050 --> 00:34:51,678
Light beer... less calories.

697
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:53,263
I tried to pick out
a new bed,

698
00:34:53,347 --> 00:34:55,724
but have you been to
the Sit 'n Sleep lately?

699
00:34:55,807 --> 00:34:59,019
Yuck. I'll just have to order
something from New York.

700
00:34:59,102 --> 00:35:01,480
Whatever blows
your dress up, darlin'.

701
00:35:01,563 --> 00:35:04,024
You go right ahead
and spend your money.

702
00:35:04,107 --> 00:35:05,651
Oh, but, darlin'...

703
00:35:05,734 --> 00:35:07,861
I thought you said we should
think of it as...

704
00:35:07,945 --> 00:35:09,321
our money.

705
00:35:14,076 --> 00:35:15,327
Just a guess,

706
00:35:15,410 --> 00:35:17,746
but I'm thinking the words
"joint checking"

707
00:35:17,829 --> 00:35:19,957
are flashing in your head
right now.

708
00:35:27,965 --> 00:35:29,383
How much did you take?

709
00:35:29,466 --> 00:35:31,218
All of it.

710
00:35:31,301 --> 00:35:32,719
Son of a bitch!

711
00:35:32,761 --> 00:35:35,681
You want a wife,
you got a wife.

712
00:35:35,764 --> 00:35:37,849
And what are you doing
with all that cash?

713
00:35:37,933 --> 00:35:39,893
Why don't you invest it?
Don't you know anything?!

714
00:35:39,977 --> 00:35:41,728
I know if you don't get out
of this house right now...

715
00:35:41,770 --> 00:35:44,231
Sign the papers, and
I'll give it all back.

716
00:35:44,273 --> 00:35:45,232
...Fine!
...Fine!

717
00:35:45,274 --> 00:35:46,817
Give me the pen.

718
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:50,904
Hold on. What are you doing
with all that cash saved up?

719
00:35:50,988 --> 00:35:52,739
And since when did you
quit the tire factory?

720
00:35:52,823 --> 00:35:54,783
You're not doing anything
illegal, are you, Jake?!

721
00:35:54,866 --> 00:35:57,077
Maybe I am. So what?

722
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:58,662
I don't ask you about
your boyfriend,

723
00:35:58,745 --> 00:36:01,415
you keep your nose
out of my life... deal?

724
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:06,920
Who told you?

725
00:36:06,962 --> 00:36:11,091
Honey, just 'cause I talk slow
doesn't mean I'm stupid.

726
00:36:18,724 --> 00:36:20,559
Look, Jake...

727
00:36:20,642 --> 00:36:24,605
Nobody finds their soul mate
when they're 10 years old.

728
00:36:27,024 --> 00:36:30,485
Yeah, I guess.

729
00:36:30,527 --> 00:36:33,030
I mean, where's
the fun in that, right?

730
00:36:47,336 --> 00:36:49,963
I can't believe you kept
this thing all these years.

731
00:36:50,047 --> 00:36:52,633
Mm-hmm.

732
00:36:52,716 --> 00:36:55,844
Most people don't know that
lightning does that to sand.

733
00:36:55,928 --> 00:36:59,640
Oh, hey, Mel,
you know what?

734
00:36:59,723 --> 00:37:00,849
[Chuckles]

735
00:37:00,933 --> 00:37:03,060
I just remembered
I got myself a hot date.

736
00:37:03,143 --> 00:37:05,729
You don't mind if I have
my lawyer take a look at these.

737
00:37:05,812 --> 00:37:06,855
What?!

738
00:37:06,939 --> 00:37:10,692
Hell, I'm just a
simple country boy.

739
00:37:10,776 --> 00:37:13,862
There's words in there
I can't even pronounce.

740
00:37:13,946 --> 00:37:16,531
You might be takin' me to
the cleaners for all I know.

741
00:37:16,615 --> 00:37:18,325
The cleaners? You?

742
00:37:18,408 --> 00:37:20,953
Say, what did this set
you back, anyhow?

743
00:37:21,036 --> 00:37:22,371
More than you
make in a month.

744
00:37:22,454 --> 00:37:24,456
Just sign the damn papers!

745
00:37:26,166 --> 00:37:27,751
Nah...

746
00:37:27,834 --> 00:37:30,212
But...
thanks for stoppin' by.

747
00:37:32,589 --> 00:37:34,841
Oh! God.

748
00:37:39,346 --> 00:37:44,101
# Bright lights, big city #

[Cellphone rings]

752
00:37:57,114 --> 00:37:59,241
I love you, I love you,
I love you.

753
00:37:59,324 --> 00:38:01,368
Andrew:
Are you sitting down?

754
00:38:01,451 --> 00:38:02,828
Melanie: Why? Bad news?

755
00:38:02,911 --> 00:38:05,622
Just picked up the "New York"
magazine, and I quote,

756
00:38:05,706 --> 00:38:07,249
"That cool breath
of fresh air

757
00:38:07,332 --> 00:38:09,376

758
00:38:09,459 --> 00:38:13,213
"was the soon-to-be household
name of Melanie Carmichael.

759
00:38:13,255 --> 00:38:16,717
Fashion insiders have labeled
her 'the next big one."'

760
00:38:16,758 --> 00:38:17,968
[Gasps]

761
00:38:18,051 --> 00:38:21,430
Oh, my God,
"the next big one"?

762
00:38:21,555 --> 00:38:25,267
Oh, God, honey, I needed that
almost as much as I need you.

763
00:38:25,350 --> 00:38:27,769
What is that noise?

764
00:38:27,853 --> 00:38:30,564
[Sighs]
The sound of my past.

765
00:38:30,647 --> 00:38:31,732
Have fun.

766
00:38:31,815 --> 00:38:33,567
[Giggles] Okay, bye.

Batten down the hatches,
boys!

773
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,919
Trouble done just walked
back into my life,

774
00:38:52,002 --> 00:38:54,755
disguised as my favorite
daughter-in-law!

775
00:38:54,838 --> 00:38:59,259
Honey, drive that pretty face
over here and give me a hug! Oh!

776
00:38:59,343 --> 00:39:01,720
Soon-to-be
ex-daughter-in-law.

777
00:39:01,803 --> 00:39:04,473
Ooh, whoo!
Who's the lucky guy?

778
00:39:04,556 --> 00:39:06,058
His name is Andrew.

779
00:39:06,141 --> 00:39:07,559
He's in politics.

780
00:39:07,643 --> 00:39:09,728
Well, you got my vote.

781
00:39:09,811 --> 00:39:12,147
Good to see you,
baby girl.

782
00:39:12,230 --> 00:39:14,441
Hey, you give this lady
whatever she wants.

783
00:39:14,524 --> 00:39:16,818
...I'll catch up with you later.
...All right.

784
00:39:20,322 --> 00:39:24,242
I'll have a Gray Goose martini,
two olives, dirty. Thanks.

785
00:39:24,326 --> 00:39:26,328
# Well... #

786
00:39:26,411 --> 00:39:29,122
Oh... my... God!

787
00:39:29,164 --> 00:39:32,334
Melanie?!

788
00:39:32,417 --> 00:39:33,669
Lurlynn?

789
00:39:33,752 --> 00:39:36,672
Yes! Oh, my God!

790
00:39:36,755 --> 00:39:38,507
L-Look at you,
all fancy.

791
00:39:38,590 --> 00:39:41,635
You look like you just
stepped out of a magazine.

792
00:39:41,718 --> 00:39:45,681
Oh, well, thank you.
Um, look at you.

793
00:39:45,722 --> 00:39:47,349
You have a baby...

794
00:39:47,432 --> 00:39:48,850
in a bar.

795
00:39:48,934 --> 00:39:50,686
Hell, I got three
more at home.

796
00:39:50,769 --> 00:39:53,689
This one's still on the tit,
so I can cart him anywhere.

797
00:39:53,772 --> 00:39:56,149
...[Baby gurgles]
...Right.

798
00:39:56,191 --> 00:39:59,486
I almost bought that exact same
top the other day.

799
00:39:59,528 --> 00:40:02,197
But Clinton'd kill me
if I spent 30 bucks

800
00:40:02,281 --> 00:40:04,658
on a sweater thing.

801
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:08,620
Ah, that Jaclyn Smith
knows what she's doin'.

802
00:40:08,704 --> 00:40:10,497
Actually, it's mine.

803
00:40:10,539 --> 00:40:13,041
Bergdorf's just picked it up.

804
00:40:16,461 --> 00:40:18,213
I design clothes now.

805
00:40:18,297 --> 00:40:21,174
Oh, mmm, now that
you mention it,

806
00:40:21,258 --> 00:40:24,511
I'm... I'm pretty sure
I heard that. [Chuckles]

807
00:40:24,595 --> 00:40:26,638
...[Cheers and applause]
...So, do you know Jaclyn Smith?

808
00:40:31,226 --> 00:40:32,978
Mind if I join you?

809
00:40:34,646 --> 00:40:36,064
Actually, we do.

810
00:40:36,148 --> 00:40:38,025
You must be Jake's hot date.

811
00:40:38,108 --> 00:40:39,526
I'm Starr.

812
00:40:39,610 --> 00:40:42,279
Hi, I'm Melanie, Jake's
snotty Yankee-bitch wife,

813
00:40:42,362 --> 00:40:43,822
whom he refuses to divorce,

814
00:40:43,905 --> 00:40:46,158
even though
I'm engaged to another man.

815
00:40:46,241 --> 00:40:48,535
Hot dog, Jake, look at
the size of that thing.

816
00:40:48,577 --> 00:40:49,995
...Honey?
...Huh?

817
00:40:50,078 --> 00:40:52,748
Why don't you get us
a couple drinks, all right?

818
00:40:52,831 --> 00:40:54,374
Okay. [Giggles]

819
00:40:56,168 --> 00:40:59,171
Is that a martini?

820
00:40:59,254 --> 00:41:04,551
Not "me and her" us.
"You and l" us.

821
00:41:14,061 --> 00:41:15,938
Why do you make me
be mean to you?

822
00:41:16,021 --> 00:41:17,272
Is that what you want...

823
00:41:17,356 --> 00:41:19,942
to be humiliated in front
of all of your friends?

824
00:41:20,025 --> 00:41:23,028
Oh, come on, Mel,
we were your friends, too.

825
00:41:24,321 --> 00:41:27,074
Well, looky, looky there!

826
00:41:27,157 --> 00:41:28,575
Well, well, well,

827
00:41:28,617 --> 00:41:31,453
if it isn't the two
groomsmen of the apocalypse.

828
00:41:33,622 --> 00:41:35,916
...Hey, Eldon!
...Yep?

829
00:41:35,958 --> 00:41:37,876
Are you hungry?!

830
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:39,503
Starved!

831
00:41:39,586 --> 00:41:41,588
No, no, no!
No, don't you dare!

832
00:41:41,672 --> 00:41:43,590
I could use a Melanie
sandwich!

833
00:41:43,632 --> 00:41:46,468
Just seems like old times,
doesn't it?

834
00:41:46,551 --> 00:41:47,594
Get off me!

835
00:41:47,678 --> 00:41:48,929
Ugh!

836
00:41:48,971 --> 00:41:52,224
No, not like old times,
all right?

837
00:41:52,307 --> 00:41:54,101
Times have changed.

838
00:41:54,142 --> 00:41:57,020
No more Melanie sandwich,
no more Melanie taco,

839
00:41:57,104 --> 00:41:59,481
and no more Melanie
corn dog, all right?

840
00:41:59,564 --> 00:42:01,608
...Sure... sorry.
...Just playin' with you.

841
00:42:01,692 --> 00:42:02,901
Come on, guys,
just grab a stick.

842
00:42:02,985 --> 00:42:04,111
Let's play some pool,
all right?

843
00:42:04,152 --> 00:42:05,237
And if you can't find a cue,

844
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:07,281
just pull the one
shoved up her ass.

845
00:42:07,322 --> 00:42:09,408
[Laughter,
cheers and applause]

846
00:42:14,496 --> 00:42:18,250
Eldon, you're still wearing
that same old stupid hat.

847
00:42:18,333 --> 00:42:20,627
Well, I... just about
got it broken in.

848
00:42:20,669 --> 00:42:22,921
Now, you sit your
bony ass down there

849
00:42:23,005 --> 00:42:25,173
and watch and see me
teach Jake here

850
00:42:25,257 --> 00:42:26,800
how to lose at pool.

851
00:42:28,385 --> 00:42:29,970
Well, see, that's the thing.

852
00:42:30,053 --> 00:42:32,598
I'm not really a watch-and-see
kind of girl...

853
00:42:32,681 --> 00:42:34,266
am I, Jake?

854
00:42:42,983 --> 00:42:46,987
Woman: Come on, now,
Bobby Ray, you got it.

855
00:42:47,070 --> 00:42:49,031
[Drunkenly] Bobby Ray...

856
00:42:49,114 --> 00:42:51,533
...[Laughs]
...[Laughs, snorts]

857
00:42:51,617 --> 00:42:55,454
Don't blow this one,
okay?

858
00:42:55,537 --> 00:42:56,705
All right, baby?

859
00:42:56,788 --> 00:42:58,707
You can take the girl
out of the honky-tonk,

860

are you going to divorce
this girl or what?

864
00:43:09,885 --> 00:43:13,305
Well, she waited 7 years.

865
00:43:13,388 --> 00:43:16,308
A couple more days
won't kill her...

866
00:43:16,391 --> 00:43:17,517
unfortunately.

867
00:43:17,601 --> 00:43:19,811

make a difference.

868

Hey, hey, let her think
whatever she wants, Clinton.

871
00:43:27,069 --> 00:43:29,988
She made up her mind
about me a long time ago.

872
00:43:30,072 --> 00:43:31,698

Okay, Jake,
it's you and Mel.

878

Clutch time, man.

879
00:43:44,086 --> 00:43:45,879
It's just like
state playoffs.

880
00:43:45,921 --> 00:43:47,506
We're down by 6,
7 seconds to go.

How could I forget?

885
00:43:58,267 --> 00:44:01,436
That was the night
Jake got me pregnant.

public with that shit?

Oh, come on.

889

It's not like anybody can
keep a secret around here...

Now, what did I
ever do to you?

892
00:44:15,158 --> 00:44:17,577
You never did anything
to me, darlin'...

the matter with you?

...What do you mean?
...Oh, she's just unhappy.

897
00:44:26,128 --> 00:44:27,671
Well, of course,
I would be, too,

called me "less than mediocre."

go to a gay bar?!

I mean, how do you people live
like this, anyway?

All right, that's it,
that's it. Come on.

Did you know that there's
a great, big world out there?

916
00:45:30,734 --> 00:45:34,154

to do with chitlins

00:52:02,709 --> 00:52:04,544
I'm... I'm here
to see Bobby Ray.

1036
00:52:04,628 --> 00:52:05,629
[Cannon fires]

1037
00:52:05,712 --> 00:52:06,922
...Oh.
...Yee-haw!

1038
00:52:07,005 --> 00:52:09,383
If he's alive,
he's out back.

1039
00:52:09,424 --> 00:52:11,218
Come on.

1040
00:52:12,636 --> 00:52:15,555
They're out here somewhere.
Watch your step.

1041
00:52:22,437 --> 00:52:23,563
Bobby Ray?

1042
00:52:23,647 --> 00:52:25,649
Bobby Ray: Melanie?!

1043
00:52:25,732 --> 00:52:27,234
Don't move!

1044
00:52:27,317 --> 00:52:29,569
Yee-haw!

1045
00:52:29,611 --> 00:52:31,405
[Cannonball whirring]

1046
00:52:35,075 --> 00:52:36,910
Hot damn!

1047
00:52:36,952 --> 00:52:39,579
Hold your fire, sir.
I'll be right back.

1048
00:52:43,959 --> 00:52:45,752
We weren't aimin' for ya,

1049
00:52:45,794 --> 00:52:48,213
but I doubt I would have
gone to your funeral.

1050
00:52:50,966 --> 00:52:54,303
I guess I wouldn't blame you.

1051
00:52:58,348 --> 00:53:01,518
Forgotten how beautiful
this place was.

1052
00:53:01,602 --> 00:53:04,813
Guess it doesn't take much
to forget a lot of things.

1053
00:53:04,896 --> 00:53:07,190
Bobby Ray,
it's not like that.

1054
00:53:07,274 --> 00:53:09,735
You know what? I'll tell
you what it's not like.

1055
00:53:09,818 --> 00:53:13,447
It's not like Jake's the only
one that you run out on.

1056
00:53:15,949 --> 00:53:18,118
I'm so sorry I outed you.

1057
00:53:19,995 --> 00:53:22,664
I guess I figured
if I was pointing at you,

1058
00:53:22,748 --> 00:53:26,835
then... nobody would
see through me.

1059
00:53:26,919 --> 00:53:31,214
Bobby Ray,
I can't find the fuse!

1060
00:53:36,845 --> 00:53:39,473
I should go
before he kills himself.

1061
00:53:47,105 --> 00:53:49,232
Bye.

1062
00:54:01,036 --> 00:54:02,663
Afternoon.

1063
00:54:02,704 --> 00:54:04,331
Can I help you?

1064
00:54:04,373 --> 00:54:06,375
Barry Lowenstein,
"New York Post."

1065
00:54:06,458 --> 00:54:10,379
Ho-ho, boy,
am I glad to see you.

1066
00:54:10,462 --> 00:54:11,838
I'll tell you, it's, uh...

1067
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:16,009
definitely, uh,
another world down here.

1068
00:54:16,093 --> 00:54:17,678
Uh, did you say
the "Post"?

1069
00:54:17,761 --> 00:54:19,221
Yes, I did.
l-I was hoping

1070
00:54:19,304 --> 00:54:21,139
to get an interview
with you and your family...

1071
00:54:21,223 --> 00:54:24,017
maybe, um, a few pictures
if you don't mind?

1072
00:54:24,059 --> 00:54:26,937
No.
I mean, uh, yes, I do...

1073
00:54:27,020 --> 00:54:27,938
mind.

1074
00:54:28,021 --> 00:54:29,231
They're not here.

1075
00:54:29,314 --> 00:54:31,483
Oh... wow.

1076
00:54:31,566 --> 00:54:33,568
This is just
as you described it.

1077
00:54:33,652 --> 00:54:37,447
It must have been amazing,
huh, growing up here?

1078
00:54:37,531 --> 00:54:39,199
Like a fantasy.

1079
00:54:39,283 --> 00:54:42,953
Would you mind if I take
a quick look inside?

1080
00:54:43,036 --> 00:54:44,454
Actually,
I'm on my way out.

1081
00:54:44,538 --> 00:54:46,373
I'll come back, then.

1082
00:54:46,415 --> 00:54:48,292
Uh, uh, okay,
but just a peek.

1083
00:54:48,375 --> 00:54:49,376
[Chuckles]

1084
00:54:51,878 --> 00:54:54,214
This is it...
home sweet home.

1085
00:54:54,298 --> 00:54:55,549
Wow!

1086
00:54:55,591 --> 00:54:57,259
How old is this place?

1087
00:54:57,342 --> 00:54:58,635
Uh...

1088
00:54:58,719 --> 00:55:02,931
it was built by my, uh,
great-great-great-grandfather,

1089
00:55:03,015 --> 00:55:04,558
Charles Carmichael,
in 1853.

1090
00:55:04,641 --> 00:55:08,478
Oh, boy, I bet you slid down
this banister a time or two.

1091
00:55:08,562 --> 00:55:09,521
Oh.

1092
00:55:09,605 --> 00:55:13,775
And over here we have
the, um...

1093
00:55:13,859 --> 00:55:16,236
[Maid humming]

1094
00:55:16,278 --> 00:55:18,739
...kitchen, but who hasn't
seen one of those?

1095
00:55:18,780 --> 00:55:19,906
Let's start over here.

1096
00:55:22,618 --> 00:55:24,453
[Door knob rattles]

1097
00:55:25,329 --> 00:55:26,663
[Humming continues]

1098
00:55:26,747 --> 00:55:28,248
[Gasps] Oh.

1099
00:55:29,666 --> 00:55:31,960
[Humming continues]

1100
00:55:34,796 --> 00:55:36,632
[Whispering] Now, this is
my favorite room.

1101
00:55:36,715 --> 00:55:41,678
It was part of the, um,
Underground Railroad.

1102
00:55:41,762 --> 00:55:44,181
[Whispering]
Why are we whispering?

1103
00:55:44,264 --> 00:55:47,059
The whole place
is haunted...

1104
00:55:47,142 --> 00:55:52,397
by ghosts of, um,
the Civil War soldiers.

1105
00:55:54,733 --> 00:55:57,152
[Door hinges creak]

1106
00:55:59,529 --> 00:56:01,949
[Creaking]

1107
00:56:03,951 --> 00:56:08,038
Jake! [Muttering]
...buttons.

1108
00:56:08,121 --> 00:56:10,666
No wonder we lost the war.

1109
00:56:12,501 --> 00:56:15,045
Was that one of 'em?

1110
00:56:15,128 --> 00:56:17,965
Melanie?

1111
00:56:18,006 --> 00:56:20,634
What are you doin'
in a closet?

1112
00:56:20,676 --> 00:56:23,178
Hi. Barry Lowenstein,
"New York Post."

1113
00:56:23,220 --> 00:56:26,473
Miss Carmichael is just showing
me around the plantation.

1114
00:56:28,684 --> 00:56:31,979
Uh, Mr. Lowenstein is writing
a piece on the family,

1115
00:56:32,020 --> 00:56:35,274
you know, since I'm marrying
the mayor's son and all.

1116
00:56:35,357 --> 00:56:37,985
I had no idea.
Isn't that something?

1117
00:56:39,528 --> 00:56:40,862
Yeah.

1118
00:56:43,240 --> 00:56:46,201
Well, a plantation by any
other name is just a farm.

1119
00:56:46,285 --> 00:56:48,620
But it does roll off the tongue
a little sweeter, doesn't it?

1120
00:56:48,704 --> 00:56:49,830
Huh.

1121
00:56:49,913 --> 00:56:53,917
Well, I do believe Miss Melanie
forgot her manners.

1122
00:56:54,001 --> 00:56:56,837
I'm Bobby Ray...
her cousin.

1123
00:56:56,878 --> 00:56:58,880
[Sighs]

1124
00:56:58,964 --> 00:57:00,340
Charmed.

1125
00:57:03,510 --> 00:57:05,887
See, when the Yankees
marched through Alabama,

1126
00:57:05,971 --> 00:57:08,640
they tried to destroy
our metal-formin' capabilities

1127
00:57:08,724 --> 00:57:11,351
by placin' barrels of powder
underneath the anvils.

1128
00:57:11,393 --> 00:57:13,186
Of course,
all that managed to do

1129
00:57:13,270 --> 00:57:15,397
was blow 'em sky-high
for a few seconds.

1130
00:57:15,480 --> 00:57:18,066
So... in honor
of that act of stupidity,

1131
00:57:18,150 --> 00:57:22,029
we all... we get together to
re-create it for the tourists.

1132
00:57:29,870 --> 00:57:31,580
...[Cannon fires]
...Aah!

1133
00:57:31,663 --> 00:57:34,166
...Yee-haw!
...What the hell was that?!

1134
00:57:34,249 --> 00:57:35,208
[Cannonball whirring]

1135
00:57:35,250 --> 00:57:38,128
Hey, Grandpa!
This here's Barry!

1136
00:57:38,211 --> 00:57:40,797
He's doin' an article
on Melanie's weddin'!

1137
00:57:40,881 --> 00:57:43,884
Never heard of her.

1138
00:57:52,309 --> 00:57:54,102
Thanks!

1139
00:57:54,186 --> 00:57:57,439
[Tires screeching]

1140
00:57:57,522 --> 00:58:01,735
Well, aren't you
just a big, fat liar.

1141
00:58:01,818 --> 00:58:03,779
Bobby Ray!

1142
00:58:03,862 --> 00:58:05,238
Oh, go back to New York.

1143
00:58:05,322 --> 00:58:06,573
[Both laugh]

1144
00:58:10,786 --> 00:58:14,706
# If fear's
what makes us decide #

1145
00:58:14,790 --> 00:58:18,919
# Our future journey #

1146
00:58:18,961 --> 00:58:21,755
# Well, I'm not along
for a life #

1147
00:58:21,797 --> 00:58:23,465
# I'm not along for a life #

1148
00:58:23,548 --> 00:58:25,717
# 'Cause I'm still yearning #

1149
00:58:25,801 --> 00:58:31,682
# l-l-I am falling down #

1150
00:58:31,765 --> 00:58:34,017
# Try and stop me #

1151
00:58:34,101 --> 00:58:39,773
# It feels so good
to hit the ground #

1152
00:58:39,856 --> 00:58:42,150
# You can watch me #

1153
00:58:42,234 --> 00:58:45,112
# I fall right on my face #

1154
00:58:45,195 --> 00:58:49,908
# It's an uphill human race #

1155
00:58:49,992 --> 00:58:55,330
# And l-I am falling down #

1156
00:58:55,414 --> 00:58:58,333
Hmm. Hello.

1157
00:58:58,417 --> 00:59:00,836
I'm sorry about what I said.

1158
00:59:00,919 --> 00:59:02,212
Really sorry.

1159
00:59:02,296 --> 00:59:04,464
Melanie, forget it.

1160
00:59:04,548 --> 00:59:06,842
Boy:
She was not sharing.

1161
00:59:06,925 --> 00:59:10,137
Okay, y'all, you need
to eat and be quiet.

1162
00:59:10,220 --> 00:59:12,014
We're gonna have us
a little visit.

1163
00:59:12,097 --> 00:59:13,849
# Ye-a, ye-a, ye-a, yeah #

1164
00:59:13,932 --> 00:59:20,647
# Oh, l-l-I am falling down #

1165
00:59:20,689 --> 00:59:23,108
# Try and stop me #

1166
00:59:23,191 --> 00:59:26,153
# It feels so good
to hit the ground #

1167
00:59:26,194 --> 00:59:29,531
You know, he went up there.

1168
00:59:29,615 --> 00:59:31,992
Who?

1169
00:59:32,075 --> 00:59:34,828
Jake? When?

1170
00:59:34,870 --> 00:59:38,081
About a year after you left.

1171
00:59:38,165 --> 00:59:41,835
He doesn't know I know,
but Clinton let it slip once.

1172
00:59:41,919 --> 00:59:43,420
Jake was in New York?

1173
00:59:43,503 --> 00:59:45,380
He told Clinton he'd never
seen anything like it.

1174
00:59:45,464 --> 00:59:47,174
He realized straight off

1175
00:59:47,215 --> 00:59:51,178
he'd need more than
an apology to win you back.

1176
00:59:51,261 --> 00:59:55,015
He needed to conquer
the world first.

1177
00:59:55,098 --> 00:59:56,892
He's been tryin' ever since.

1178
00:59:56,975 --> 01:00:00,187
That's why he kept
sending the papers back.

1179
01:00:00,228 --> 01:00:02,481
Yeah.

1180
01:00:02,564 --> 01:00:07,194
Hmm. It's funny
how things don't work out.

1181
01:00:07,277 --> 01:00:08,195
[Baby gurgles]

1182
01:00:08,278 --> 01:00:11,031
It's funny how they do.

1183
01:00:18,372 --> 01:00:20,332
[Cheers and applause]

1184
01:00:28,257 --> 01:00:29,758
# Now, listen here #

1185
01:00:29,841 --> 01:00:33,053
# Well, I tried to tell you,
baby #

1186
01:00:33,095 --> 01:00:35,514
# But that don't make
no sense #

1187
01:00:35,597 --> 01:00:38,976
# Now you got me, baby #

1188
01:00:39,059 --> 01:00:40,894
# Up against that fence #

1189
01:00:40,978 --> 01:00:45,565
...# Ain't that a shame? #
...# Shame #

1190
01:00:45,649 --> 01:00:47,776
# Shame, shame
the way you do #

1191
01:00:47,859 --> 01:00:50,570
Man: Ha-ha! Ha!

1192
01:00:53,156 --> 01:00:56,285
Hey, look who I found
hangin' out by the parkin' lot.

1193
01:00:56,368 --> 01:00:57,786
Hesitant to join us.

1194
01:00:57,869 --> 01:00:59,997
# Shame, shame,
shame on you #

1195
01:01:00,080 --> 01:01:02,040
Jake: Anybody think
of anything in here

1196
01:01:02,124 --> 01:01:04,418
that, uh, might bother
Bobby Ray?

1197
01:01:04,459 --> 01:01:07,129
...Uh, Clinton's breath?
...Ha!

1198
01:01:08,922 --> 01:01:10,882
You still the same Bobby Ray
from last night?

1199
01:01:10,966 --> 01:01:13,093
Last time I checked,
yeah.

1200
01:01:13,176 --> 01:01:16,513
Well, then, I'm gonna
buy you a drink.

1201
01:01:16,597 --> 01:01:19,141
Well, you're really not
my type, I mean...

1202
01:01:19,224 --> 01:01:22,728
[Laughter]

1203
01:01:26,523 --> 01:01:29,192
Oh, honey, you...
you drink that from the top.

1204
01:01:29,276 --> 01:01:32,738
I'm just lookin' to see who
makes this Deep South Glass.

1205
01:01:32,821 --> 01:01:34,781
I wonder if you can get it

Hey, Jake,
Mel would like to know

1208
01:01:38,744 --> 01:01:42,623
where she can find some of
that snooty-faluty glass.

1209
01:01:42,664 --> 01:01:44,166
Why ask me?

1210
01:01:44,207 --> 01:01:46,168
Oh, I don't know.
Maybe because you're...

Jake...

1216
01:02:07,689 --> 01:02:10,192
When was the last time you
pushed me around the floor?

1217
01:02:10,233 --> 01:02:12,277
Clinton here has got
two left feet.

Well, Ms. Taylor,
I'd be honored.

1219
01:02:14,780 --> 01:02:16,406
Let's do it. Come on.

1220

Come on, Mel,
get on out here!

I ain't as clumsy as I look.
She just can't keep time.

1223
01:02:26,166 --> 01:02:28,377
You might have to
prove that to me.

Sorry it took me so long.

I would have come sooner

went pear-shaped...

you never left my side.

of a good dog, wasn't he?

Yeah.

having fun out there tonight.

and...

this fits, too.

one or the other?

and wings, Mel.

for the winter.

out there sometimes.

rollin' in.

I had a dream about it
the other night.

You ever wonder
what would have happened

1291

if we hadn't have gotten
pregnant?

Just...

1294
01:07:31,763 --> 01:07:34,850
let me get this out
before I can't.

1295
01:07:36,685 --> 01:07:38,812
I thought that baby
would be an adventure.

1296
01:07:38,895 --> 01:07:42,649
And it took me a while
to realize

1297
01:07:42,733 --> 01:07:46,486
it would have been
your only adventure.

1298

knew better, huh?

1301
01:08:01,084 --> 01:08:03,754
relieved.

1302
01:08:06,256 --> 01:08:11,762
And all of a sudden, I just...
needed a different life.

1303
01:08:14,890 --> 01:08:19,144
You done real well
for yourself.

1304
01:08:19,227 --> 01:08:21,438

I'm just sorry I never danced
with you at our weddin'.

1306

gonna go better for ya.

is all.

the way you two
were lookin' at each other.

1314

about it, Mama?!

He hasn't done
anything wrong!

1317
01:09:43,061 --> 01:09:44,938
He hasn't done anything right
either!

1318
01:09:44,980 --> 01:09:46,940
I can't believe I'm even
having this argument!

1319
01:09:46,982 --> 01:09:48,942
I'm leaving! I'm gone!

1320

a second chance, so please

end up like me! Damn it!

1329
01:10:09,880 --> 01:10:13,508
Now, you need to stay as far
away from here as you can.

with being you, Mama?

deserve better, that's all.

01:13:02,219 --> 01:13:06,014
I'm just, uh, talkin'
to Mel's fiance here.

1380
01:13:06,098 --> 01:13:08,517
Wonder if you might know
where she is.

1381
01:13:08,600 --> 01:13:10,394
Andrew Hennings.
You must be...

1382
01:13:10,477 --> 01:13:15,440
l-I'm Bobby Ray...
her, uh, cousin?

1383
01:13:15,524 --> 01:13:19,236
I see you've already met
Jake... her, uh...

1384
01:13:19,319 --> 01:13:21,280
...Other cousin.
...[Laughs]

1385
01:13:21,363 --> 01:13:24,032
Family! God, it's great
to meet you both.

1386
01:13:24,116 --> 01:13:26,034
I think Melanie said
somethin' last night

1387
01:13:26,118 --> 01:13:27,536
about, uh, visitin'
her daddy

1388
01:13:27,619 --> 01:13:29,329
u-up at the...
up at the battlefield.

1389
01:13:29,371 --> 01:13:31,665
...The battlefield?
...You know us Southerners.

1390
01:13:31,748 --> 01:13:33,333
I mean, the minute
the Confederacy died,

1391
01:13:33,417 --> 01:13:34,710
it became a moral issue.

1392
01:13:34,793 --> 01:13:39,006
Come on, I'll, uh, I'll
give you a ride up there.

1393
01:13:39,089 --> 01:13:42,009
That's great. Thank you.
All right. Nice meeting you.

1394
01:13:44,386 --> 01:13:49,516
# What this world needs
is a few more rednecks #

1395
01:13:49,558 --> 01:13:51,435
# So people ain't afraid
to take a stand #

1396
01:13:51,518 --> 01:13:55,522
So, who's...
Melanie... Smooter?

1397
01:13:55,606 --> 01:13:57,816
Local hero around here.

1398
01:13:57,899 --> 01:13:59,693
Why is that?

1399
01:13:59,735 --> 01:14:01,028
She blew up the bank.

1400
01:14:01,111 --> 01:14:03,363
And that made her a hero?

1401
01:14:03,447 --> 01:14:07,576
Well, notorious, anyway.
She was 10.

1402
01:14:07,659 --> 01:14:08,910
Oh.

1403
01:14:08,994 --> 01:14:13,206
Fortunately, nobody was hurt...
except, maybe, the cat.

1404
01:14:13,248 --> 01:14:15,417
What cat?

1405
01:14:15,500 --> 01:14:18,003
The one with the dynamite
on its back.

1406
01:14:18,086 --> 01:14:20,881
She blew up a cat?

1407
01:14:20,964 --> 01:14:23,300
...He was scheduled to die.
...From dynamite?

1408
01:14:23,383 --> 01:14:25,886
The vet said it had cancer,

1409
01:14:25,969 --> 01:14:28,931
so Eldon thought it'd be put
in one of those chambers,

1410
01:14:29,014 --> 01:14:31,683
you know, the ones
that suck their lungs out.

1411
01:14:31,767 --> 01:14:34,561
Little Mel, she couldn't bear
the thought of that.

1412
01:14:34,645 --> 01:14:37,064
She, uh, she wanted
somethin' more humane.

1413
01:14:37,147 --> 01:14:39,066
Yeah, sure.

1414
01:14:39,107 --> 01:14:42,277
So, they were doing some
blastin' out by the new highway.

1415
01:14:42,361 --> 01:14:45,447
So, we, uh, we took
old Fuzz up there,

1416
01:14:45,530 --> 01:14:46,907
taped him up.

1417
01:14:46,949 --> 01:14:50,452
Used about 30 feet of fuse
just to be on the safe side,

1418
01:14:50,535 --> 01:14:52,287
said our prayers,
and ran like hell.

1419
01:14:52,371 --> 01:14:54,247
Of course.

1420
01:14:54,331 --> 01:14:56,249
So, there we were,
sittin' in Virgie's Diner,

1421
01:14:56,291 --> 01:14:58,835
feelin' pretty blue.

1422
01:14:58,919 --> 01:15:00,921
When Mel looks up and sees
that damn cat,

1423
01:15:01,004 --> 01:15:04,132
trottin' down the road,
searchin' for Eldon.

1424
01:15:04,216 --> 01:15:06,593
No shit.

1425
01:15:06,635 --> 01:15:08,428
Yeah, and we
would have caught him, too,

1426
01:15:08,470 --> 01:15:11,682
but once that fuse hit his tail,
boom, he took off like a shot.

1427
01:15:11,765 --> 01:15:13,141
And into the bank.

1428
01:15:13,225 --> 01:15:15,769
Well... the theory is,

1429
01:15:15,852 --> 01:15:17,854
he probably wriggled loose
from the explosive.

1430
01:15:17,938 --> 01:15:21,316
'Cause, uh, people still
see him from time to time,

1431
01:15:21,400 --> 01:15:23,110
scorched tail and all.

1432
01:15:23,151 --> 01:15:26,446
He's a little skittish
around humans.

1433
01:15:26,488 --> 01:15:28,949
That's quite a story.

1434
01:15:28,991 --> 01:15:31,118
She was quite a girl.

1435
01:15:31,159 --> 01:15:34,037
# A little less talk
and a little more action #

1436
01:15:34,121 --> 01:15:36,039
Whatever happened to her?

1437
01:15:36,123 --> 01:15:37,457
# And a few more rednecks... #

1438
01:15:37,499 --> 01:15:40,752
Oh, you know...
wound up pregnant,

1439
01:15:40,836 --> 01:15:44,840
married some loser
right out of high school.

1440
01:15:44,923 --> 01:15:50,304
[Trumpet playing "Taps"]

1441
01:16:03,609 --> 01:16:04,943
["Taps" ends]

1442
01:16:05,027 --> 01:16:08,030
[Whistling,
cheers and applause]

1443
01:16:18,290 --> 01:16:20,751
Are you surprised?

1444
01:16:24,212 --> 01:16:26,048
What are you doing here?

1445
01:16:26,131 --> 01:16:28,258
Well, I came to deliver
your fiance.

1446
01:16:28,342 --> 01:16:29,593
I think
she was talking to me.

1447
01:16:29,676 --> 01:16:30,719
Jake...

1448
01:16:30,802 --> 01:16:32,429
Must be exhaustin'.

1449
01:16:32,512 --> 01:16:33,430
...What?
...What?

1450
01:16:33,513 --> 01:16:34,973
Livin' a lie.

1451
01:16:35,057 --> 01:16:36,266
What's he talking about?

1452
01:16:37,768 --> 01:16:40,729
You and I are in love
with two different people.

1453
01:16:46,652 --> 01:16:49,112
Is he a second cousin?

1454
01:16:50,238 --> 01:16:52,032
He's my husband.

1455
01:16:52,074 --> 01:16:53,241
Your what?

1456
01:16:53,325 --> 01:16:54,326
I mean my ex-husband.

1457
01:16:54,409 --> 01:16:55,869
You married your cousin?!

1458
01:16:55,953 --> 01:16:58,705
No, I came down here
to finalize my divorce.

1459
01:16:58,747 --> 01:17:01,249
Hey, darlin',
thought that was you.

1460
01:17:03,835 --> 01:17:05,545
Must be your new someone.

1461
01:17:07,130 --> 01:17:09,049
Earl Smooter...
glad to meet ya.

1462
01:17:12,928 --> 01:17:14,596
Melanie Smooter.

1463
01:17:17,432 --> 01:17:18,392
Andrew, wait.

1464
01:17:18,475 --> 01:17:20,060
Wait!

1465
01:17:20,143 --> 01:17:23,063
Andrew! Wait!

1466
01:17:23,146 --> 01:17:24,064
I just...

1467
01:17:24,147 --> 01:17:25,274
Please.

1468
01:17:25,357 --> 01:17:27,234
Let me try
and explain myself!

1469
01:17:27,276 --> 01:17:29,278
You don't understand!

1470
01:17:29,319 --> 01:17:31,738
This is not
who I am anymore!

1471
01:17:31,780 --> 01:17:33,782
Look, I don't know who you are
or what else you lied about,

1472
01:17:33,865 --> 01:17:35,284
but I know one thing...

1473
01:17:35,367 --> 01:17:38,996
there is a Lear Jet
in Mobile, and I am on it.

1474
01:17:41,039 --> 01:17:43,333
[Sighs]

1475
01:17:59,558 --> 01:18:00,934
I know you're thinkin'

1476
01:18:01,018 --> 01:18:03,770
I spoiled things good
this time.

1477
01:18:03,812 --> 01:18:07,524
Oh, hon, don't go accusin' me
of thinkin'.

1478
01:18:07,608 --> 01:18:10,736
I ain't done
anything of the sort.

1479
01:18:10,819 --> 01:18:13,780
Anyway, spoiled's in the eye
of the beholder...

1480
01:18:15,449 --> 01:18:16,908
...like these plums here.

1481
01:18:16,992 --> 01:18:20,787
Some people might
call them "spoiled"...

1482
01:18:20,829 --> 01:18:25,125
but I think that, um,
these almost-ruined ones

1483
01:18:25,167 --> 01:18:28,128
sometimes make
the sweetest jam.

1484
01:18:30,130 --> 01:18:32,007
Do you need any help?

1485
01:18:34,134 --> 01:18:35,719
It was kind of fun,

1486
01:18:35,802 --> 01:18:38,055
seeing Daddy up there,
surrendering.

1487
01:18:38,138 --> 01:18:40,098
Yeah.

1488
01:18:40,182 --> 01:18:42,976
He sure does have
a flair for the dramatic.

1489
01:18:43,018 --> 01:18:46,146
You certainly don't get it
from my side of the family.

1490
01:18:48,273 --> 01:18:50,108
Hey, y'all.

1491
01:18:50,192 --> 01:18:52,486
Look who I found
walkin' down l-58.

1492
01:18:52,569 --> 01:18:54,363
Hi.

1493
01:18:54,446 --> 01:18:57,282
Hi.

1494
01:18:59,201 --> 01:19:02,579
I thought you'd be
halfway to New York by now.

1495
01:19:02,663 --> 01:19:05,666
So did I.

1496
01:19:05,749 --> 01:19:09,086
Ooh, if I'd known
company was comin',

1497
01:19:09,169 --> 01:19:11,338
I'd have put on the dog.

1498
01:19:12,798 --> 01:19:14,675
This is my mama.

1499
01:19:14,716 --> 01:19:17,052
Hi.

1500
01:19:17,135 --> 01:19:19,012
She makes the best jam
in three counties.

1501
01:19:19,096 --> 01:19:21,181
[Scoffs] Oh.

1502
01:19:21,265 --> 01:19:23,850
And my dad...
you... you already met him.

1503
01:19:23,934 --> 01:19:25,060
Yeah.

1504
01:19:26,687 --> 01:19:29,856
And this is our home.

1505
01:19:29,940 --> 01:19:32,401
This is where I grew up.

1506
01:19:33,777 --> 01:19:36,029
Well, it's a pleasure
meeting you both.

1507
01:19:36,113 --> 01:19:38,407
I'm... Andrew Hennings...

1508
01:19:38,490 --> 01:19:40,701
Melanie's fiance...

1509
01:19:40,784 --> 01:19:45,414
well... that is... if...
if she'll still have me.

1510
01:19:50,794 --> 01:19:53,505
Look, Mel...

1511
01:19:53,547 --> 01:19:57,009
I really don't care
what happened down here.

1512
01:19:57,050 --> 01:19:59,011
So... you have a past.

1513
01:19:59,052 --> 01:20:01,054
I mean, who doesn't?

1514
01:20:06,643 --> 01:20:08,562
What I need to know

1515
01:20:08,645 --> 01:20:12,274
is if there is a place for me
in your future.

1516
01:20:12,357 --> 01:20:17,279
Oh, good Lord.
That is the sweetest thing.

1517
01:20:18,905 --> 01:20:20,282
Well, go on.

1518
01:20:26,872 --> 01:20:29,458
Oh! Hello, New York City!

1519
01:20:29,541 --> 01:20:31,919
Woman, what the hell
you gassin' about?

1520
01:20:32,002 --> 01:20:34,379
Well, sir...

1521
01:20:34,463 --> 01:20:36,548
my mother happens to be
the mayor up there,

1522
01:20:36,590 --> 01:20:38,592
and, uh, she'd like
nothing better

1523
01:20:38,634 --> 01:20:41,094
than a big, snazzy
New York wedding.

1524
01:20:44,097 --> 01:20:45,641
Well, uh...

1525
01:20:45,724 --> 01:20:48,185
yeah, I suppose
I can take off work.

1526
01:20:50,771 --> 01:20:53,607
Andrew, I, um...
actually, I was thinking,

1527
01:20:53,649 --> 01:20:55,692
maybe we could have
the wedding here.

1528
01:20:58,528 --> 01:20:59,613
Here.

1529
01:20:59,696 --> 01:21:01,949
In my hometown.

1530
01:21:02,991 --> 01:21:05,202
Look, Mel, if you're worried
about the money, don't.

1531
01:21:05,285 --> 01:21:07,704
It's not about
the money, Andrew...

1532
01:21:07,788 --> 01:21:08,997
not down here.

1533
01:21:12,292 --> 01:21:14,670
You know...
a lot of people

1534
01:21:14,753 --> 01:21:18,257
are expecting us
to get married in the city,

1535
01:21:18,340 --> 01:21:20,634
but I think a nice,
quiet, country wedding

1536
01:21:20,717 --> 01:21:21,843
is just the ticket.

1537
01:21:23,804 --> 01:21:25,847
Earl...

1538
01:21:25,931 --> 01:21:27,474
Pearl, if you...
if you folks could

1539
01:21:27,557 --> 01:21:29,935
take care
of the rehearsal dinner,

1540
01:21:29,977 --> 01:21:32,854
I'd really like
to take care of the rest.

1541
01:21:32,938 --> 01:21:35,482
Well, I think
we could cover that.

1542
01:21:37,276 --> 01:21:38,694
Heck. [Chuckles]

1543
01:21:38,777 --> 01:21:42,072
How many times does
your only daughter get married?

1544
01:21:42,155 --> 01:21:44,825
[Chuckling]

1545
01:21:46,743 --> 01:21:49,830
Other than before.

1546
01:21:49,913 --> 01:21:51,581
Felony Melanie?

1547
01:21:51,665 --> 01:21:52,833
She was never convicted.

1548
01:21:52,874 --> 01:21:54,042
Oh-ho.

1549
01:21:54,126 --> 01:21:56,003
I don't know
which is worse...

1550
01:21:56,086 --> 01:21:58,714
child cat killer
or sons of the Confederacy.

1551
01:21:58,797 --> 01:22:01,800
What would you suggest I do...
dump her for being poor?

1552
01:22:01,883 --> 01:22:03,760
You're supposed to be
a Democrat, remember?

1553
01:22:03,844 --> 01:22:05,804
There is nothing wrong
with being poor.

1554
01:22:05,846 --> 01:22:07,431
I get elected by poor people,

1555
01:22:07,514 --> 01:22:09,391
and I'm a big enough person
to commend her

1556
01:22:09,474 --> 01:22:11,518
for making something of herself.

1557
01:22:11,602 --> 01:22:13,604
What upsets me
is that she lied to you.

1558
01:22:13,687 --> 01:22:16,148
So what? She was ashamed
of her background.

1559
01:22:16,231 --> 01:22:19,067
Who hasn't been embarrassed by
their parents at one point?

1560
01:22:19,151 --> 01:22:21,862
I'm going to assume that
was a rhetorical question.

1561
01:22:21,945 --> 01:22:23,697
Assume away.

1562
01:22:25,991 --> 01:22:28,869
[Sighs] No one is going to
change my mind about this...

1563
01:22:28,910 --> 01:22:31,121
not you, not the media,
not anyone.

1564
01:22:31,204 --> 01:22:34,207
Fine...

1565
01:22:34,291 --> 01:22:37,377
but admit it...
I was right.

1566
01:22:37,461 --> 01:22:40,005
Yes... you were right.

1567
01:22:42,049 --> 01:22:43,675
There is a wedding
in your future,

1568
01:22:43,759 --> 01:22:45,594
whether you like it or not.

1569
01:22:47,387 --> 01:22:50,140
And how, exactly,
does Little Miss Alabama

1570
01:22:50,223 --> 01:22:52,351
plan to accommodate
500 people?

1571
01:22:52,392 --> 01:22:54,394
I suppose she has connections
at the jail.

1572
01:22:54,478 --> 01:22:56,146
Well, there are
several excellent choices...

1573
01:22:56,229 --> 01:22:59,650
the Travelodge,
Days Inn, a Motel 6,

1574
01:22:59,733 --> 01:23:01,610
oh, and
the Golden Cherry Motel,

1575
01:23:01,693 --> 01:23:02,903
where we will be.

1576
01:23:02,945 --> 01:23:05,155
Laugh now,
but if this gets out...

1577
01:23:05,238 --> 01:23:06,198
It won't.

1578
01:23:06,239 --> 01:23:09,117
The press expects
the Plaza in June.

1579
01:23:16,083 --> 01:23:18,252
# Something's #

1580
01:23:18,335 --> 01:23:22,172
# Been creepin' into my head #

1581
01:23:22,256 --> 01:23:24,633
# Turnin' my thoughts #

1582
01:23:24,716 --> 01:23:30,847
...[Telephone ringing]
...# Into a dizzy red #

1583
01:23:30,931 --> 01:23:32,516
Now, let's talk
about your wedding.

1584
01:23:32,599 --> 01:23:34,142
This place is gorgeous,

1585
01:23:34,226 --> 01:23:36,603
and we can control
the security.

1586
01:23:36,645 --> 01:23:38,146
...[Ringing continues]
...The Carmichael plantation?

1587
01:23:38,230 --> 01:23:41,108
It did inspire your identity,
did it not?

1588
01:23:41,149 --> 01:23:43,318
...You thought of everything.
...Yeah, well, I always do.

1589
01:23:43,402 --> 01:23:45,153
Been great.
Keep in touch.

1590
01:23:45,237 --> 01:23:47,739
# Now you have come #

1591
01:23:47,823 --> 01:23:51,535
...[Ringing continues]
...# To get some lofty role #

1592
01:23:51,618 --> 01:23:55,789
# Oh, you got me walkin'
backwards #

1593
01:23:55,872 --> 01:23:59,001
# You got me thinkin'
sideways #

1594
01:23:59,084 --> 01:24:02,796
# You got me talkin' circles #

1595
01:24:02,879 --> 01:24:06,508
# You got me losin' my way #

1596
01:24:06,592 --> 01:24:10,220
# You got me crossin'
every line #

1597
01:24:10,304 --> 01:24:12,180
[Ringing continues]

1598
01:24:12,264 --> 01:24:17,144
# You got me just in #

1599
01:24:17,227 --> 01:24:19,271
# Time #

1600
01:24:19,354 --> 01:24:20,355
[Ringing stops]

1601
01:24:23,900 --> 01:24:25,777
...You guys remember the sheik.
...Yeah.

1602
01:24:25,819 --> 01:24:27,070
Well, he proposed to me,

1603
01:24:27,154 --> 01:24:29,489
and I think I loved him,
despite his billions.

1604
01:24:29,573 --> 01:24:31,199
Then why didn't you say
"yes"?

1605
01:24:31,283 --> 01:24:33,368
Because I hesitated
long enough to realize

1606
01:24:33,452 --> 01:24:36,038
my head and my heart were saying
two different things.

1607
01:24:36,121 --> 01:24:37,998
...It's this way.
...Yeah.

1608
01:24:38,040 --> 01:24:39,499
Well, it's a big decision.

1609
01:24:39,583 --> 01:24:41,585
Well, it's supposed to be
the easiest one you ever make.

1610
01:24:41,668 --> 01:24:42,836
Wasn't it?

1611
01:24:45,964 --> 01:24:47,424
Hey, Tabby, this is it...

1612
01:24:47,507 --> 01:24:49,968
this is the stuff
I was telling you about.

1613
01:24:50,052 --> 01:24:52,346
"Deep South Glass."

1614
01:24:52,429 --> 01:24:55,182
Oh, yes. Let's.

1615
01:25:21,249 --> 01:25:23,043
What's the matter?

1616
01:25:23,126 --> 01:25:24,294
Oh, my God.

1617
01:25:26,672 --> 01:25:29,883
Do we know...

1618
01:25:29,967 --> 01:25:31,593
Mo'?

1619
01:25:40,811 --> 01:25:42,354
Mel?

1620
01:26:09,089 --> 01:26:11,383
Wow. Look at these.

1621
01:26:11,425 --> 01:26:14,303
It's what happens to sand
when it's struck by lightning.

1622
01:26:14,386 --> 01:26:15,971
She's pulling your dick.

1623
01:26:16,054 --> 01:26:18,932
No, really.
I've seen it.

1624
01:26:19,016 --> 01:26:21,101
You just have to dig it up.

1625
01:26:21,184 --> 01:26:22,644
Huh.

1626
01:26:33,238 --> 01:26:34,781
Oh, hey, Bryant.

1627
01:26:34,865 --> 01:26:35,949
Friend of yours?

1628
01:26:46,835 --> 01:26:48,629
Hey.

1629
01:26:48,712 --> 01:26:50,631
Hey.

1630
01:26:50,714 --> 01:26:53,342
I saw him first.

1631
01:26:53,425 --> 01:26:57,387
I, uh...
think he's already taken.

1632
01:26:59,514 --> 01:27:02,184
I, um...

1633
01:27:02,267 --> 01:27:04,353
I tried to call you
a couple of times.

1634
01:27:05,479 --> 01:27:07,397
Listen, since you're here,

1635
01:27:07,481 --> 01:27:09,399
you and your friends should,
you know, look around,

1636
01:27:09,483 --> 01:27:11,151
and have some lunch.

1637
01:27:11,234 --> 01:27:13,362
Y'all should sit
on the deck. It's nice.

1638
01:27:14,738 --> 01:27:16,156
Jake...

1639
01:27:20,994 --> 01:27:24,081
Come on, Bryant,
let's, uh...

1640
01:27:24,164 --> 01:27:26,041
let's leave this lady alone.

1641
01:27:27,960 --> 01:27:29,419
Come on.

1642
01:27:34,007 --> 01:27:35,133
Come on, boy.

1643
01:27:39,304 --> 01:27:40,889
Yes, sir.
Can we help you?

1644
01:27:41,974 --> 01:27:45,227
l-I'm... I'm looking
for a Melanie Carmichael.

1645
01:27:46,436 --> 01:27:47,854
Anybody here
recognize that name?

1646
01:27:47,896 --> 01:27:49,189
Man: No.

1647
01:27:49,231 --> 01:27:51,692
What business
you got with her?

1648
01:27:51,733 --> 01:27:54,069
I'm afraid
that's a private matter.

1649
01:27:54,152 --> 01:27:55,237
[Chuckles]

1650
01:27:55,320 --> 01:27:57,572
Well, then, I'm afraid
we can't help you.

1651
01:28:08,792 --> 01:28:10,711
Damn reporters.

1652
01:28:10,752 --> 01:28:13,463
Like the first ant
at a picnic.

1653
01:28:13,547 --> 01:28:15,048
Mm-hmm.

1654
01:28:15,132 --> 01:28:19,428
Now... this one here's
from Louisiana.

1655
01:28:19,511 --> 01:28:22,180
See? It's got
a little alligator on top.

1656
01:28:22,222 --> 01:28:24,933
How sweet. I can see where
your daughter gets her taste.

1657
01:28:25,017 --> 01:28:26,018
Ohh.

1658
01:28:26,101 --> 01:28:29,354

[Sighs]

1660
01:28:31,982 --> 01:28:34,526
This is one of those disasters
waiting to happen.

1661
01:28:34,568 --> 01:28:37,237
You know, one of the big ones
that only cockroaches survive.

1662
01:28:37,321 --> 01:28:38,739
It's going to be fine.

1663
01:28:38,822 --> 01:28:40,073

One down...
7 million to go.

1667
01:28:52,711 --> 01:28:53,921
Careful.

1668
01:28:54,004 --> 01:28:55,672
You just smashed
the state bird of Alabama.

1669
01:28:55,756 --> 01:28:56,924
...Ohh!
...[Laughs]

1670

Hi!

1672
01:29:00,302 --> 01:29:02,095
...Well, finally.
...Hi! How are you?!

1673
01:29:02,137 --> 01:29:03,847
...Hey, buddy.
...Hello, sir.

1674
01:29:03,931 --> 01:29:06,308
Well, I can see
why Melanie is so adorable.

1675
01:29:06,391 --> 01:29:07,851
...I'm so happy to be here.
...Hey!

such a mess, Mrs. Hennings...

No, no, no, no, no...
don't you dare. It's "Kate."

1682
01:29:17,486 --> 01:29:19,279
You know, I've been
tryin' to get Earl

1683
01:29:19,321 --> 01:29:22,199
to weed these shrubberies
and repaint the trim.

1684

And... oh, my God,

1685
01:29:23,617 --> 01:29:26,495
Iook how pretty she is,
Earl.

1686
01:29:26,578 --> 01:29:28,956
Yeah, I'll bet Kate
could use a drink.

1687
01:29:29,039 --> 01:29:30,707
Kate could, indeed.

1688
01:29:30,791 --> 01:29:32,542
...[Chuckling]
...Well, just come right on in.

1689
01:29:32,626 --> 01:29:33,669
I've got some fried pickles,

...Yum!

getting my house painted, too.

i-it's a lovely chair,
Earl.

1694

Earl: Yeah, but to get
the full effect,

1695
01:29:45,472 --> 01:29:47,015
you got to pull
this here handle.

1696
01:29:47,099 --> 01:29:48,600
Daddy, no!

1697
01:29:48,684 --> 01:29:50,852

your drink, Kate, and watch.

I'm not on that list,

but I've got some urgent
business with the bride.

1713

Not today, you don't.
Trooper?

1714
01:30:26,930 --> 01:30:28,849
All right, sir, let's get it
turned around here.

1715

01:30:58,879 --> 01:31:01,214
Yeah, I heard mention of it
a time or two.

1725
01:31:01,256 --> 01:31:04,843
I sure hope
this weather cooperates.

1726
01:31:04,927 --> 01:31:07,846
It's supposed to be
a big one.

1727
01:31:07,888 --> 01:31:09,389
...[Clanging]
...You know, Jake...

1728
01:31:10,807 --> 01:31:15,187
You're my only son...
and I love you,

1729
01:31:15,228 --> 01:31:17,356
but sometimes...

1730
01:31:17,397 --> 01:31:22,319
you are too much
like your daddy.

1731
01:31:22,402 --> 01:31:24,905
She made her decision,
Mama.

1732
01:31:27,157 --> 01:31:30,786
For somebody who's been holdin'
onto somethin' so hard,

1733
01:31:30,869 --> 01:31:32,746
you're pretty quick
to let it go.

1734
01:31:36,041 --> 01:31:37,834
You know,
I can't control her

1735
01:31:37,918 --> 01:31:40,254
any more than
I can control the weather.

1736
01:31:53,433 --> 01:31:55,102
It's just nerves.

1737
01:31:55,185 --> 01:31:57,604
You're doin'
the right thing.

1738
01:31:58,689 --> 01:32:00,232
Am I?

1739
01:32:02,192 --> 01:32:04,820
When I married
your daddy...

1740
01:32:04,903 --> 01:32:07,990
oh, Lord, but I was
a fool for that man.

1741
01:32:08,073 --> 01:32:10,575
I couldn't put one foot
in front of the other.

1742
01:32:10,659 --> 01:32:12,703
I remember standin' there,
thinkin',

1743
01:32:12,786 --> 01:32:16,957
"Oh, preacher, hurry up
before he changes his mind."

1744
01:32:17,040 --> 01:32:19,293
[Laughing]
Look where it got me.

1745
01:32:19,376 --> 01:32:20,502
[Inhales deeply]

1746
01:32:20,586 --> 01:32:23,088
Sometimes
that man makes me so mad,

1747
01:32:23,171 --> 01:32:25,048
I could just wring his neck.

1748
01:32:25,132 --> 01:32:26,592
But you still love him.

1749
01:32:26,675 --> 01:32:28,176
God knows I do.

1750
01:32:28,260 --> 01:32:31,638
[Laughing]
And only he knows why.

1751
01:32:31,680 --> 01:32:33,557
Mama... I think I...

1752
01:32:33,640 --> 01:32:38,437
He can give you a life
that we never dreamed of.

1753
01:32:38,478 --> 01:32:40,314
And he adores you.

1754
01:32:42,482 --> 01:32:44,443
[Thunder rumbling]

1755
01:32:44,526 --> 01:32:46,028
He does, doesn't he?

1756
01:32:47,654 --> 01:32:49,364

["Here Comes the Bride" plays]

1758
01:33:20,062 --> 01:33:23,774
Well, even if he is a Yankee,
at least he's sober.

1759
01:33:23,857 --> 01:33:24,983

01:33:26,860 --> 01:33:28,737
...Get him!

Get back here!

Mr. Buford?

Ugh!
Get your hands off me!

1768
01:33:39,873 --> 01:33:41,541
Wait! Let him go.

1769
01:33:45,420 --> 01:33:46,797
Melanie?

Mr. Buford,
he signed the papers.

What are you doing here?

1775
01:34:01,812 --> 01:34:05,399
He did... you didn't.

1776
01:34:06,608 --> 01:34:08,652
What?

1777
01:34:13,615 --> 01:34:15,284
You mean I'm still married?

not unless you want to be.

Oh, for God's sakes,
Melanie.

1781
01:34:21,790 --> 01:34:23,667
I thought
you took care of this.

1782
01:34:23,750 --> 01:34:25,419
It's an honest mistake,
Andrew.

1783
01:34:25,460 --> 01:34:28,046
Well, then, can we fix it
before we all get soaked?

1784
01:34:28,130 --> 01:34:30,215
Does anybody have a pen?

You don't want
to marry me.

I don't?

You see, the truth is...

1801
01:35:44,414 --> 01:35:46,541
I gave my heart away
a long time ago...

My whole heart...

1803
01:35:50,212 --> 01:35:52,673
and I never really
got it back.

what else to say,

1805

1808
01:36:06,561 --> 01:36:09,064
And you shouldn't want
to marry me.

Wow. [Chuckles]

1810
01:36:17,906 --> 01:36:20,867

is what this feels like.

That's it?!

You're just gonna
let her humiliate you

about an old husband?!

I have never met anyone
so manipulative,

so deceitful!

trying to be honest.

the future President
of the United States

1827
01:37:28,894 --> 01:37:32,272
to be dumped at the altar
by some psycho Daisy Mae!

Uh, there... there's no need
for name-callin', now.

Now, she spoke her piece,
and that's all there is to it.

Oh, go back
to your double-wide

1833

Why didn't you tell me
you came to New York?

somethin' of myself.

for what I want.

Melanie?

I don't even think
you know.

You're the first boy
I ever kissed, Jake,

1864

to be the last.

had our chance.

married to me for, anyhow?

this time?

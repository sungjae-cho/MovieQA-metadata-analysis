1
00:01:00,519 --> 00:01:05,106
Between the time
when the oceans drank Atlantis...

2
00:01:05,274 --> 00:01:08,943
...and the rise of the sons of Aryas...

3
00:01:09,111 --> 00:01:12,488
...there was an age undreamed of.

4
00:01:12,698 --> 00:01:15,533
And unto this, Conan...

5
00:01:15,701 --> 00:01:19,370
...destined to bear the jeweled crown
of Aquilonia...

6
00:01:19,538 --> 00:01:22,206
...upon a troubled brow.

7
00:01:22,374 --> 00:01:27,712
It is I, his chronicler,
who alone can tell thee of his saga.

8
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:33,926
Let me tell you of the days
of high adventure.

9
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:19,592
Fire and wind come from the sky...

10
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:22,345
...from the gods of the sky.

11
00:04:22,763 --> 00:04:27,516
But Crom is your god.
Crom, and he lives in the earth.

12
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,771
Once, giants lived in the earth, Conan.

13
00:04:32,564 --> 00:04:36,859
And in the darkness of chaos,
they fooled Crom...

14
00:04:37,027 --> 00:04:40,029
...and they took from him
the enigma of steel.

15
00:04:40,197 --> 00:04:44,033
Crom was angered, and the earth shook.

16
00:04:44,201 --> 00:04:46,369
And fire and wind
struck down these giants...

17
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:49,205
...and they threw their bodies
into the waters.

18
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:54,460
But in their rage,
the gods forgot the secret of steel...

19
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:57,129
...and left it on the battlefield.

20
00:04:57,547 --> 00:04:59,715
And we who found it...

21
00:05:00,926 --> 00:05:02,802
...are just men.

22
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:07,723
Not gods, not giants.

23
00:05:07,891 --> 00:05:09,558
Just men.

24
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:14,897
The secret of steel
has always carried with it a mystery.

25
00:05:15,065 --> 00:05:19,819
You must learn it, little Conan.
You must learn its discipline.

26
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:25,074
For no one, no one in this world,
can you trust.

27
00:05:25,242 --> 00:05:29,036
Not men, not women, not beasts.

28
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:34,500
This you can trust.

29
00:07:57,519 --> 00:07:59,144
Hyah!

30
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:34,763
Kill that one!

31
00:08:58,204 --> 00:09:00,372
Kill them! Crush them!

32
00:13:36,107 --> 00:13:39,318
The ashes were trampled into the earth...

33
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:42,404
...and the blood became as snow.

34
00:13:42,572 --> 00:13:45,324
Who knows what they came for?

35
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:49,286
Weapons of steel or murder?

36
00:13:49,913 --> 00:13:54,541
lt was never known,
for their leader rode to the south...

37
00:13:54,709 --> 00:13:59,046
...while children went north
with the Vanir.

38
00:13:59,756 --> 00:14:05,802
No one would ever know
that my lord's people had lived at all.

39
00:14:07,597 --> 00:14:11,934
His was a tale of sorrow.

40
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:44,146
Sit here.

41
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:47,858
Sit here.

42
00:20:01,534 --> 00:20:04,953
He did not care anymore.

43
00:20:05,121 --> 00:20:07,872
Life and death...

44
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:10,625
...the same.

45
00:20:11,586 --> 00:20:15,130
Only that the crowd would
be there to greet him...

46
00:20:15,298 --> 00:20:20,135
...with howls of lust and fury.

47
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:24,889
He began to realize his sense of worth.

48
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:27,642
He mattered.

49
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:06,931
ln time, his victories
could not easily be counted.

50
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:12,145
He was taken to the East, a great prize...

51
00:21:12,313 --> 00:21:17,150
...where the war masters
would teach him the deepest secrets.

52
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:45,220
Language and writing
were made available.

53
00:21:45,388 --> 00:21:50,225
The poetry of Khitai,
the philosophy of Sung.

54
00:21:57,650 --> 00:22:02,153
And he also came to know
the pleasures of women...

55
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:07,117
...when he was bred to the finest stock.

56
00:23:16,312 --> 00:23:22,609
But always there remained
the discipline of steel.

57
00:23:32,495 --> 00:23:34,829
My fear is that my sons
will never understand me.

58
00:23:40,127 --> 00:23:41,169
We've won again.

59
00:23:42,922 --> 00:23:46,257
This is good. But what is best in life?

60
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:48,468
The open steppe...

61
00:23:48,636 --> 00:23:50,345
...fleet horse...

62
00:23:50,513 --> 00:23:55,183
...falcons at your wrist,
and the wind in your hair.

63
00:23:55,351 --> 00:23:59,771
Wrong! Conan, what is best in life?

64
00:23:59,939 --> 00:24:02,857
To crush your enemies,
see them driven before you...

65
00:24:03,025 --> 00:24:05,151
...and to hear the lamentation
of their women.

66
00:24:05,319 --> 00:24:06,361
That is good.

67
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:09,239
That is good.

68
00:24:47,695 --> 00:24:50,655
Go. Go. You're free.

69
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:56,411
Go.

70
00:24:56,579 --> 00:24:58,204
It has been surmised...

71
00:24:58,372 --> 00:25:01,583
...that perhaps my lord
was like a wild animal...

72
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:04,294
...that had been kept too long.

73
00:25:04,461 --> 00:25:06,588
Perhaps, but whatever...

74
00:25:06,755 --> 00:25:13,261
...freedom, so long
an unremembered dream, was his.

75
00:29:13,252 --> 00:29:15,419
Crom.

76
00:30:40,464 --> 00:30:42,423
There's warmth and fire.

77
00:30:46,261 --> 00:30:50,431
Do you not wish to warm yourself
by my fire?

78
00:31:40,482 --> 00:31:42,984
They said you would come.

79
00:31:45,988 --> 00:31:50,950
From the north, a man of great strength.

80
00:31:53,161 --> 00:31:55,371
A conqueror.

81
00:31:56,999 --> 00:32:01,210
A man who would someday be king
by his own hand.

82
00:32:02,671 --> 00:32:04,922
One who would crush the snakes
of the earth--

83
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:07,300
Snakes? Did you say snakes?

84
00:32:13,682 --> 00:32:17,601
-What is it you seek?
-A standard.

85
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:19,854
A symbol.

86
00:32:20,022 --> 00:32:22,231
Perhaps on a shield.

87
00:32:22,816 --> 00:32:25,651
Two snakes coming together.

88
00:32:27,195 --> 00:32:29,322
Facing each other...

89
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:30,781
...but they're one.

90
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:35,870
With-- With a sun and a moon below.

91
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:40,499
Black sun, black moon.

92
00:32:40,667 --> 00:32:42,835
Yes.

93
00:32:45,005 --> 00:32:48,382
There's a price, barbarian.

94
00:32:54,306 --> 00:32:55,723
Zamora.

95
00:32:58,894 --> 00:33:03,773
Crossroads of the world.

96
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:06,901
You will...

97
00:33:08,403 --> 00:33:13,908
...find what you want...

98
00:33:14,076 --> 00:33:18,204
...in Zamora.

99
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:24,645
Crom.

100
00:34:47,836 --> 00:34:49,628
Food.

101
00:34:50,672 --> 00:34:52,465
Food.

102
00:34:57,262 --> 00:34:59,346
I have not eaten for days.

103
00:35:03,852 --> 00:35:05,936
And who says you will?

104
00:35:08,356 --> 00:35:12,776
Give me food so I have strength
when the wolves come.

105
00:35:13,695 --> 00:35:16,363
Let me die not in hunger...

106
00:35:17,657 --> 00:35:19,283
...but in combat.

107
00:35:20,202 --> 00:35:21,452
Who are you?

108
00:35:24,456 --> 00:35:29,043
I am Subotai, thief and archer.

109
00:35:29,586 --> 00:35:32,880
I am Hyrkanian,
the great order of Kerlait.

110
00:35:33,048 --> 00:35:34,632
So, what are you doing here?

111
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:38,052
Dinner for wolves.

112
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:46,227
What gods do you pray to?

113
00:35:49,814 --> 00:35:52,233
I pray to the four winds.

114
00:35:53,276 --> 00:35:54,944
And you?

115
00:35:55,111 --> 00:35:56,904
To Crom.

116
00:36:01,952 --> 00:36:04,286
But I seldom pray to him.

117
00:36:04,454 --> 00:36:05,829
He doesn't listen.

118
00:36:08,041 --> 00:36:10,376
What good is he, then?

119
00:36:10,794 --> 00:36:13,420
Eh, it's just as I've always said.

120
00:36:13,588 --> 00:36:15,589
He is strong.

121
00:36:15,757 --> 00:36:17,841
lf I die, I have to go before him...

122
00:36:18,552 --> 00:36:21,762
...and he will ask me,
"What is the riddle of steel?"

123
00:36:21,930 --> 00:36:25,099
lf I don't know it, he will cast me
out of Valhalla and laugh at me.

124
00:36:25,267 --> 00:36:28,435
That's Crom, strong on his mountain.

125
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:33,065
-Eh, my god is greater.
-Heh, heh.

126
00:36:33,233 --> 00:36:36,652
Crom laughs at your four winds.
Laughs from his mountain.

127
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:39,405
My god is stronger.

128
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:43,534
He is the everlasting sky.

129
00:36:44,494 --> 00:36:46,787
Your god lives underneath him.

130
00:37:28,663 --> 00:37:31,790
Civilization, ancient and wicked.

131
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:34,335
Have you ever seen this before?

132
00:37:34,502 --> 00:37:37,504
No. Let's waste no time.

133
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:57,650
It's good.

134
00:37:57,817 --> 00:38:00,152
You have no idea
how long it's been there.

135
00:38:03,490 --> 00:38:05,032
Stink!

136
00:38:06,368 --> 00:38:09,953
Does it always smell like this?
How does the wind ever get in here?

137
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:50,494
How about two snakes
coming together over a black sun?

138
00:38:50,662 --> 00:38:52,746
A magnificent standard.

139
00:38:52,914 --> 00:38:57,042
The only snakes I know of are those of Set,
in those cursed towers.

140
00:38:57,210 --> 00:38:59,211
They have spread to every city.

141
00:38:59,379 --> 00:39:01,839
Two, three years ago,
it was just another snake cult.

142
00:39:02,006 --> 00:39:03,590
Now, everywhere.

143
00:39:03,758 --> 00:39:07,970
lt is said that they are deceivers.
They murder people in the night.

144
00:39:08,138 --> 00:39:10,347
I know nothing.

145
00:39:11,433 --> 00:39:12,433
Hey.

146
00:39:17,731 --> 00:39:20,482
Black lotus. Stygian. The best.

147
00:39:21,651 --> 00:39:23,235
This better not be Haga.

148
00:39:23,403 --> 00:39:26,071
I would sell Haga to a slayer such as you?

149
00:39:26,948 --> 00:39:31,201
-A pittance to protect you from evil.
-l am evil. Heh.

150
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:33,746
They're all sluts.

151
00:39:35,498 --> 00:39:36,874
He's dead already.

152
00:39:42,255 --> 00:39:44,298
Can you believe that? Huh?

153
00:39:44,466 --> 00:39:45,924
Ah.
Can you be--?

154
00:39:53,641 --> 00:39:56,477
You're too big to be a thief.

155
00:40:02,108 --> 00:40:04,526
Come. Let's leave this place.

156
00:40:10,033 --> 00:40:12,242
You looking for snakes?

157
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:14,828
They live in the Tower of the Serpent.

158
00:40:14,996 --> 00:40:19,374
Said to have riches without end
and the greatest jewel of all...

159
00:40:19,542 --> 00:40:21,835
...the Eye of the Serpent.

160
00:40:22,003 --> 00:40:26,006
Chew it slowly. It's the good stuff.

161
00:41:06,714 --> 00:41:10,384
-You are not a guard.
-Neither are you.

162
00:41:10,552 --> 00:41:13,512
We're thieves, heh, like yourself.

163
00:41:15,223 --> 00:41:18,350
-Come to climb the tower.
-You don't even have a rope.

164
00:41:20,728 --> 00:41:24,064
Two fools who laugh at death.

165
00:41:24,524 --> 00:41:27,025
Do you know what horrors
lie beyond that wall?

166
00:41:27,902 --> 00:41:29,611
No.

167
00:41:32,073 --> 00:41:33,907
Then you go first.

168
00:42:20,455 --> 00:42:25,083
-What on earth could smell so bad?
-Do you wanna live forever?

169
00:43:06,626 --> 00:43:07,834
That one.

170
00:43:08,336 --> 00:43:10,837
He's the high priest,
second only to Thulsa Doom.

171
00:43:11,214 --> 00:43:13,840
They say Thulsa Doom's
a thousand years old.

172
00:43:18,721 --> 00:43:21,014
I'll see what's here.
Go find out what's below.

173
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:42,776
lnfidel!

174
00:47:57,124 --> 00:47:59,459
lnfidels!

175
00:48:23,192 --> 00:48:24,276
Kill them!

176
00:48:28,823 --> 00:48:30,448
Do you wanna live forever?

177
00:52:30,481 --> 00:52:36,736
All manner of pleasures
and diversions were indulged.

178
00:52:36,904 --> 00:52:39,531
Wealth can be wonderful.

179
00:52:41,408 --> 00:52:45,828
But you know,
success can test one's mettle...

180
00:52:45,996 --> 00:52:51,084
...as surely as the strongest adversary.

181
00:53:14,567 --> 00:53:20,113
They were taken to the hall
of King Osric, the Usurper.

182
00:53:20,281 --> 00:53:24,284
Once a powerful Northman like my lord...

183
00:53:24,451 --> 00:53:27,745
...but now old and sotted.

184
00:53:32,918 --> 00:53:35,128
These are the thieves
you have requested, sire.

185
00:53:35,796 --> 00:53:37,297
I thought there were three.

186
00:53:37,464 --> 00:53:42,468
Uh, our companion, he died in the gardens.
Lions ate him.

187
00:53:43,012 --> 00:53:44,304
Lions ate him?

188
00:53:51,812 --> 00:53:54,606
Lions ate him.

189
00:54:04,825 --> 00:54:06,159
You know what you've done?

190
00:54:08,579 --> 00:54:14,125
Why, Rexor himself has come before me,
threatened me, the king.

191
00:54:14,293 --> 00:54:19,505
What daring! What outrageousness!
What insolence! What arrogance!

192
00:54:27,348 --> 00:54:29,766
I salute you.

193
00:54:36,023 --> 00:54:41,903
Thulsa Doom.
I've chafed for years at this demigod.

194
00:54:42,071 --> 00:54:45,573
Snakes in my beautiful city.

195
00:54:45,741 --> 00:54:50,787
To the west, Nemedia, Aquilonia.
To the south, Koth, Stygia.

196
00:54:50,954 --> 00:54:55,041
Snakes. Everywhere, these evil towers.

197
00:54:55,209 --> 00:54:59,629
You alone have stood up to their guards.
And what are you?

198
00:54:59,797 --> 00:55:01,297
Thieves.

199
00:55:08,097 --> 00:55:09,806
You see this?

200
00:55:10,766 --> 00:55:14,727
They call it the Fangs of the Serpent.

201
00:55:14,895 --> 00:55:19,065
And this one was thrust
into a father's heart...

202
00:55:19,233 --> 00:55:21,609
...by his very son.

203
00:55:22,653 --> 00:55:28,741
And my own daughter has fallen
under this Thulsa Doom's spell.

204
00:55:30,411 --> 00:55:35,331
ls there a dagger such as this
in her hand for me?

205
00:55:37,626 --> 00:55:40,128
She follows him as a slave...

206
00:55:40,295 --> 00:55:43,589
...seeking for the truth of her soul...

207
00:55:43,757 --> 00:55:46,509
...as if I could not give it to her.

208
00:55:53,392 --> 00:55:58,688
As we speak, my daughter travels east...

209
00:55:58,856 --> 00:56:03,234
...to Thulsa Doom
and his Mountain of Power.

210
00:56:04,111 --> 00:56:07,405
She is to be his.

211
00:56:15,956 --> 00:56:20,209
Steal my daughter back.
Take all you can carry.

212
00:56:24,882 --> 00:56:30,052
There's more. There's much more.
Enough to become kings yourselves.

213
00:56:34,767 --> 00:56:40,938
There comes a time, thief,
when the jewels cease to sparkle...

214
00:56:41,106 --> 00:56:44,358
...when the gold loses its luster...

215
00:56:44,526 --> 00:56:47,820
...when the throne room
becomes a prison...

216
00:56:49,406 --> 00:56:54,827
...and all that is left
is a father's love for his child.

217
00:57:01,293 --> 00:57:04,295
To the hellfires with Thulsa Doom.
He's evil.

218
00:57:04,463 --> 00:57:07,673
A sorcerer who can summon demons.

219
00:57:08,175 --> 00:57:12,845
His followers' only purpose
is to die in his service.

220
00:57:14,306 --> 00:57:16,390
Thousands of them.

221
00:57:17,059 --> 00:57:21,479
This Mountain of Power where he lives
is said to be impregnable.

222
00:57:23,565 --> 00:57:27,193
I have talked to Subotai and he agrees.

223
00:57:27,361 --> 00:57:30,363
Let's take what we have while we live.

224
00:57:39,581 --> 00:57:42,875
I have never had so much as now.

225
00:57:44,169 --> 00:57:47,046
All my life, I've been alone.

226
00:57:49,341 --> 00:57:53,386
Many times I've faced my death
with no one to know.

227
00:57:55,889 --> 00:57:59,559
I would look into the huts and the tents
of others in the coldest dark...

228
00:57:59,726 --> 00:58:03,563
...and I would see figures
holding each other in the night.

229
00:58:05,732 --> 00:58:08,317
But I always passed by.

230
00:58:11,947 --> 00:58:16,576
You and l, we have warmth.

231
00:58:16,743 --> 00:58:19,787
That's so hard to find in this world.

232
00:58:21,623 --> 00:58:27,003
Please, let someone else pass by
in the night.

233
00:58:28,088 --> 00:58:32,925
Let us take the world by the throat
and make it give us what we desire.

234
01:00:55,902 --> 01:01:01,490
The children of Doom. Doom's children.

235
01:01:01,658 --> 01:01:06,328
They told my lord the way
to the Mountain of Power.

236
01:01:06,496 --> 01:01:12,585
They told him to throw down his sword
and return to the earth.

237
01:01:15,756 --> 01:01:19,800
Time enough for the earth in the grave.

238
01:02:25,534 --> 01:02:28,369
Ooh.

239
01:02:28,537 --> 01:02:34,416
Once, great men lived here. Giants, gods.

240
01:02:34,584 --> 01:02:36,335
Once, but long ago.

241
01:02:44,344 --> 01:02:47,429
It was here that I met my master.

242
01:02:47,597 --> 01:02:50,141
It was no accident...

243
01:02:50,308 --> 01:02:56,814
...nor is it mere chance
that I am the teller of his tale.

244
01:02:58,692 --> 01:02:59,692
Hey!

245
01:03:03,029 --> 01:03:05,614
I'm a wizard, mind you.

246
01:03:05,782 --> 01:03:11,328
This place is kept by powerful gods
and spirits of kings.

247
01:03:11,496 --> 01:03:15,666
Harm my flesh
and you will have to deal with the dead.

248
01:03:16,376 --> 01:03:18,460
Can you summon demons, wizard?

249
01:03:18,628 --> 01:03:21,964
Yes! I strike at you.

250
01:03:22,132 --> 01:03:26,051
I would summon a demon more ferocious
than all in hell.

251
01:03:44,070 --> 01:03:48,324
WlZARD: Mounds have been here
since the time of the Titans.

252
01:03:48,700 --> 01:03:52,244
Kings buried in them, great kings.

253
01:03:52,412 --> 01:03:57,333
Domains once glittered like the light
on the windy sea.

254
01:03:58,084 --> 01:04:02,630
Fire won't burn there. No fire at all.

255
01:04:02,797 --> 01:04:05,925
That's why I live down here in the wind.

256
01:04:07,052 --> 01:04:09,011
Do you care for these places?

257
01:04:09,179 --> 01:04:13,557
I sing to them on nights when they wish.

258
01:04:13,725 --> 01:04:19,438
I sing of the tales of battles, heroes,
witches and women.

259
01:04:20,065 --> 01:04:22,274
Nobody bothers me down here.

260
01:04:22,442 --> 01:04:25,903
Not even Thulsa Doom.

261
01:04:29,908 --> 01:04:31,700
Do flowers grow around here?

262
01:04:32,619 --> 01:04:34,328
Flowers?

263
01:04:43,171 --> 01:04:44,797
Flowers.

264
01:04:45,882 --> 01:04:48,842
 You've not come here
as a pilgrim, have you?

265
01:04:49,010 --> 01:04:52,221
Oil the sword and feed the horse.

266
01:04:52,389 --> 01:04:54,974
Have you ever ridden
one of those things before?

267
01:04:57,519 --> 01:04:58,978
No!

268
01:05:01,564 --> 01:05:05,859
Warrior, what are the flowers for?

269
01:05:06,027 --> 01:05:07,069
For a girl.

270
01:05:31,261 --> 01:05:34,263
Doom, Doom, Doom.

271
01:05:45,942 --> 01:05:49,320
Doom.

272
01:05:50,864 --> 01:05:59,163
Doom.

273
01:07:06,356 --> 01:07:08,816
Where do you think you're going,
brother?

274
01:07:08,983 --> 01:07:10,734
I am afraid.

275
01:07:10,902 --> 01:07:15,531
Afraid to bare yourself? Why?

276
01:07:15,698 --> 01:07:18,409
You're so big and so well grown.

277
01:07:18,576 --> 01:07:21,036
You should be proud of your body.

278
01:07:21,204 --> 01:07:26,125
How do you expect to reach emptiness
without knowing your own body?

279
01:07:26,918 --> 01:07:29,545
Could we talk over there...

280
01:07:29,712 --> 01:07:32,131
...where the others cannot see?

281
01:07:32,298 --> 01:07:36,885
Why, yes, brother. Of course.

282
01:07:49,983 --> 01:07:53,026
I am afraid and I am shy.

283
01:07:55,029 --> 01:07:57,739
ls this, uh, your robe?

284
01:07:58,616 --> 01:08:00,284
Priest's robe?

285
01:08:00,452 --> 01:08:03,162
Yes, it's all I have.

286
01:08:03,830 --> 01:08:04,872
Good.

287
01:08:08,793 --> 01:08:11,503
That's all you'll ever need.

288
01:08:14,716 --> 01:08:16,383
Brother.

289
01:10:01,781 --> 01:10:03,782
WO
What do you see?

290
01:10:04,450 --> 01:10:07,035
Uh, infinity.

291
01:10:07,912 --> 01:10:09,538
Good.

292
01:11:20,151 --> 01:11:22,819
I see you.

293
01:11:24,989 --> 01:11:27,699
I have watched you.

294
01:11:27,867 --> 01:11:32,245
For a thousand years,
I have watched you.

295
01:11:32,413 --> 01:11:35,874
Doom.

296
01:11:36,626 --> 01:11:43,882
Doom.

297
01:11:58,773 --> 01:12:02,651
Who among you still fears death?

298
01:12:03,403 --> 01:12:06,697
Who will not face emptiness?

299
01:12:07,740 --> 01:12:09,533
-lnfidel!
lnfidel!

300
01:13:09,135 --> 01:13:11,428
I wish to speak to you now.

301
01:13:20,146 --> 01:13:22,481
Where is the Eye of the Serpent?

302
01:13:26,319 --> 01:13:29,905
Rexor says that you gave it to a girl.

303
01:13:30,364 --> 01:13:34,159
Probably for a mere night's pleasure.
Hmm?

304
01:13:35,077 --> 01:13:37,245
What a loss.

305
01:13:38,456 --> 01:13:41,958
People have no grasp of what they do.

306
01:13:43,377 --> 01:13:47,798
You broke into my house,
stole my property...

307
01:13:47,965 --> 01:13:50,801
...murdered my servants and my pets.

308
01:13:50,968 --> 01:13:54,304
And that is what grieves me the most.

309
01:13:55,181 --> 01:13:57,933
You killed my snake.

310
01:13:58,100 --> 01:14:02,020
Thorgrim is beside himself with grief.

311
01:14:03,856 --> 01:14:08,443
He raised that snake
from the time it was born.

312
01:14:12,615 --> 01:14:14,866
You killed my mother.

313
01:14:15,034 --> 01:14:18,119
You killed my father.
You killed my people!

314
01:14:18,287 --> 01:14:20,330
You took my father's sword.

315
01:14:23,709 --> 01:14:25,168
Ah.

316
01:14:25,336 --> 01:14:28,046
lt must have been when I was younger.

317
01:14:28,881 --> 01:14:32,676
There was a time, boy,
when I searched for steel.

318
01:14:32,844 --> 01:14:37,305
When steel meant more to me
than gold or jewels.

319
01:14:38,850 --> 01:14:41,810
The riddle of steel.

320
01:14:42,603 --> 01:14:44,229
Yes.

321
01:14:44,397 --> 01:14:46,815
You know what it is, don't you, boy?

322
01:14:47,859 --> 01:14:51,987
Shall I tell you? It's the least I can do.

323
01:14:53,739 --> 01:14:59,160
Steel isn't strong, boy. Flesh is stronger.

324
01:14:59,328 --> 01:15:00,370
Look around you.

325
01:15:03,833 --> 01:15:05,959
There, on the rocks.

326
01:15:07,837 --> 01:15:10,338
That beautiful girl.

327
01:15:11,090 --> 01:15:13,300
Come to me, my child.

328
01:15:23,227 --> 01:15:25,979
That is strength, boy.

329
01:15:26,147 --> 01:15:28,273
That is power.

330
01:15:28,441 --> 01:15:31,776
The strength and power of flesh.

331
01:15:31,944 --> 01:15:35,947
What is steel
compared to the hand that wields it?

332
01:15:36,616 --> 01:15:40,577
Look at the strength of your body,
the desire in your heart.

333
01:15:40,745 --> 01:15:43,872
I gave you this.

334
01:15:44,040 --> 01:15:46,291
Such a waste.

335
01:15:49,295 --> 01:15:52,422
Contemplate this on the Tree of Woe.

336
01:15:58,679 --> 01:16:01,306
Crucify him.

337
01:19:01,862 --> 01:19:03,279
He said you were a wizard.

338
01:19:05,241 --> 01:19:07,242
Do the gods owe you any favors?

339
01:19:11,163 --> 01:19:15,834
There are dangers,
but I see you care little for those.

340
01:19:16,001 --> 01:19:19,045
The spirits of this place
extract a heavy toll.

341
01:19:19,213 --> 01:19:20,839
Then I will pay them.

342
01:20:16,979 --> 01:20:18,521
Drink.

343
01:20:26,071 --> 01:20:31,576
Sometime soon, perhaps tonight,
they'll try to take him.

344
01:20:31,744 --> 01:20:36,206
-And if they succeed--
-lf they succeed, you'll follow.

345
01:22:08,007 --> 01:22:11,301
No! No!

346
01:22:23,147 --> 01:22:24,897
No!

347
01:22:35,868 --> 01:22:39,245
Stop! Stop!

348
01:23:08,692 --> 01:23:09,734
They're gone.

349
01:23:12,821 --> 01:23:14,864
They're gone!

350
01:24:08,335 --> 01:24:11,129
All the gods, they cannot sever us.

351
01:24:11,296 --> 01:24:16,050
lf I were dead and you still fighting for life,
I'd come back from the darkness...

352
01:24:16,635 --> 01:24:21,848
...back from the pit of hell
to fight at your side.

353
01:25:35,714 --> 01:25:39,300
The old man says
the Mountain of Power is hollow.

354
01:25:40,052 --> 01:25:42,553
Thulsa Doom lives in the mountain.

355
01:25:43,639 --> 01:25:45,515
What else does he say?

356
01:25:46,058 --> 01:25:49,227
That in the back of the mountain,
there's a gorge.

357
01:25:49,853 --> 01:25:50,978
Many caves.

358
01:25:52,439 --> 01:25:54,732
A thief could get in there,
steal the princess...

359
01:25:54,900 --> 01:25:57,902
...and be off before she's missed
in the darkness.

360
01:25:58,070 --> 01:26:01,739
Good thieves could do that,
but not vengeful ones.

361
01:26:05,244 --> 01:26:09,830
Only the girl.
We kill Thulsa Doom another day.

362
01:26:14,086 --> 01:26:15,378
Agreed?

363
01:26:17,881 --> 01:26:19,507
Conan?

364
01:31:10,924 --> 01:31:13,467
So this is paradise.

365
01:31:20,308 --> 01:31:22,184
Princess.

366
01:35:23,051 --> 01:35:24,802
Get them!

367
01:35:40,443 --> 01:35:42,319
Come on!

368
01:35:50,829 --> 01:35:52,287
You.

369
01:38:06,631 --> 01:38:08,423
Help him.

370
01:38:14,973 --> 01:38:17,599
The infidel defilers...

371
01:38:18,643 --> 01:38:21,979
...they shall all drown in lakes of blood.

372
01:38:22,146 --> 01:38:26,108
Now they will know
why they are afraid of the dark.

373
01:38:26,276 --> 01:38:30,445
Now they will learn
why they fear the night.

374
01:39:04,397 --> 01:39:06,606
Seek.

375
01:39:56,741 --> 01:40:02,079
The wizard.
I told him I would pay the gods.

376
01:40:18,679 --> 01:40:20,639
Hold me.

377
01:40:23,267 --> 01:40:27,604
Kiss me.

378
01:40:33,027 --> 01:40:36,780
Let me breathe my last breath
into your mouth.

379
01:40:38,449 --> 01:40:40,784
I'm so cold.

380
01:40:46,457 --> 01:40:48,750
So cold.

381
01:40:51,754 --> 01:40:54,381
Keep me...

382
01:40:56,467 --> 01:40:58,135
...warm.

383
01:41:01,472 --> 01:41:03,306
Keep...

384
01:41:05,435 --> 01:41:07,269
...me....

385
01:42:05,036 --> 01:42:10,207
Hey. Fire won't burn up there.
No fire at all.

386
01:42:47,411 --> 01:42:49,204
Why do you cry?

387
01:42:50,706 --> 01:42:54,167
He is Conan, Cimmerian.

388
01:42:54,919 --> 01:42:56,836
He won't cry.

389
01:42:58,756 --> 01:43:01,049
So I cry for him.

390
01:44:26,469 --> 01:44:29,679
He will kill you. He has seen your fires.

391
01:44:29,889 --> 01:44:33,850
He will come for me,
and when he does, he will kill you.

392
01:44:48,658 --> 01:44:53,703
I remember days like this
when my father took me to the forest...

393
01:44:53,871 --> 01:44:56,539
...and we ate wild blueberries.

394
01:44:56,999 --> 01:44:59,709
More than 20 years ago.

395
01:44:59,877 --> 01:45:03,380
I was just a boy of 4 or 5.

396
01:45:04,840 --> 01:45:07,967
The leaves were so dark and green then.

397
01:45:08,886 --> 01:45:12,847
The grass smelled sweet
with the spring wind.

398
01:45:16,811 --> 01:45:19,729
Almost 20 years of pitiless combat.

399
01:45:19,897 --> 01:45:23,525
No rest, no sleep like other men.

400
01:45:24,360 --> 01:45:27,529
And yet the spring wind blows, Subotai.

401
01:45:28,322 --> 01:45:30,156
Have you ever felt such a wind?

402
01:45:31,200 --> 01:45:33,702
They blow where I live too.

403
01:45:36,038 --> 01:45:38,748
ln the north of every man's heart.

404
01:45:41,335 --> 01:45:43,378
It's never too late, Subotai.

405
01:45:44,046 --> 01:45:46,005
No.

406
01:45:48,217 --> 01:45:51,553
lt would only lead me back here
another day.

407
01:45:53,931 --> 01:45:55,765
ln even worse company.

408
01:46:02,898 --> 01:46:06,109
For us, there is no spring.

409
01:46:06,610 --> 01:46:11,364
Just the wind that smells fresh
before the storm.

410
01:46:59,497 --> 01:47:02,332
Hey, old man.
Where'd you get this stuff?

411
01:47:02,500 --> 01:47:03,666
The dead.

412
01:47:03,834 --> 01:47:08,421
The gods are pleased with you.
They will watch the battle. Heh.

413
01:47:08,589 --> 01:47:11,216
-Are they going to help?
-No. Ha, ha.

414
01:47:11,383 --> 01:47:14,344
-Well, then tell them to stay out of the way.
-Aah! Ha-ha-ha.

415
01:48:42,016 --> 01:48:43,975
Crom...

416
01:48:44,435 --> 01:48:47,312
...l have never prayed to you before.

417
01:48:47,897 --> 01:48:49,772
I have no tongue for it.

418
01:48:50,274 --> 01:48:55,904
No one, not even you,
will remember if we were good men or bad.

419
01:48:56,071 --> 01:48:59,032
Why we fought or why we died.

420
01:48:59,199 --> 01:49:00,450
No.

421
01:49:00,618 --> 01:49:04,412
All that matters
is that two stood against many.

422
01:49:04,580 --> 01:49:06,581
That's what's important.

423
01:49:06,957 --> 01:49:12,420
Valor pleases you, Crom,
so grant me one request.

424
01:49:13,380 --> 01:49:16,257
Grant me revenge.

425
01:49:16,842 --> 01:49:21,596
And if you do not listen,
then to hell with you.

426
01:51:51,622 --> 01:51:52,622
Hyah!

427
01:52:46,301 --> 01:52:49,804
That's how we do it.
-l did it. With my spear.

428
01:54:00,751 --> 01:54:02,501
Do you wanna live forever?

429
01:54:56,640 --> 01:54:58,766
Doom!

430
01:54:58,934 --> 01:55:02,019
Don't leave me! My lord!

431
01:55:10,195 --> 01:55:12,655
No, don't kill me!

432
01:55:18,829 --> 01:55:21,330
Father!

433
01:56:28,523 --> 01:56:31,609
Doom.

434
01:56:32,152 --> 01:56:38,824
Doom.

435
01:57:45,225 --> 01:57:48,477
The purging is at last at hand.

436
01:57:48,645 --> 01:57:51,147
The day of doom is here.

437
01:57:56,153 --> 01:57:59,780
All that is evil, all that have eyes...

438
01:57:59,990 --> 01:58:02,575
...your parents, your leaders...

439
01:58:02,742 --> 01:58:06,787
...those who would call themselves
your judges.

440
01:58:06,955 --> 01:58:09,832
Those who have lied...

441
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:12,668
...and corrupted the earth.

442
01:58:12,836 --> 01:58:15,462
They shall all be cleansed.

443
01:58:15,630 --> 01:58:19,550
Doom.

444
01:58:19,718 --> 01:58:22,595
You, my children, are the water...

445
01:58:23,180 --> 01:58:27,349
...that will wash away
all that has gone before.

446
01:58:27,517 --> 01:58:31,270
ln your hand you hold my light...

447
01:58:31,438 --> 01:58:34,356
...a gleam in the eye of Set.

448
01:58:34,524 --> 01:58:38,694
This flame will burn away the darkness...

449
01:58:39,196 --> 01:58:43,365
...burn you away to paradise!

450
01:58:43,533 --> 01:58:45,784
Doom.

451
01:58:48,038 --> 01:58:55,461
Doom.

452
01:59:19,653 --> 01:59:21,779
My child.

453
01:59:22,364 --> 01:59:25,324
You have come to me, my son.

454
01:59:26,910 --> 01:59:30,371
For who now is your father
if it is not me?

455
01:59:31,873 --> 01:59:34,333
Who gave you the will to live?

456
01:59:36,378 --> 01:59:40,923
I am the wellspring from which you flow.

457
01:59:42,300 --> 01:59:44,635
When I am gone...

458
01:59:45,262 --> 01:59:48,055
...you will have never been.

459
01:59:49,182 --> 01:59:54,061
What will your world be without me?

460
01:59:57,607 --> 02:00:05,281
My son.

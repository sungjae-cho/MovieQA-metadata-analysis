1
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:50,272
Bingo.

2
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,797
Fucking hell.

3
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,837
Fucking hell.

4
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,480
- Oh, God.
- Keep your shit together.

5
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,518
lf you wanna get 'em out of here.

6
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,880
- I can pop these, no problem.
- So get to it.

7
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,909
Security, we have a break-in...

8
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,759
I know who you are.
I know what you think...

9
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,515
lf you don't wanna get hurt,
keep your mouth shut and don't move.

10
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:42,628
The chimps are infected. They're highly
contagious. They've been given an inhibitor.

11
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,030
- lnfected with what?
- To cure, you must first understand.

12
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:48,953
lnfected with what?

13
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,637
Rage.

14
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:57,317
- What is he talking about?
- Get the cages open.

15
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:03,478
Listen, you sick bastard,
we're taking your torture victims with us.

16
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,073
We'll get you out of here.

17
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:09,631
The animals are contagious. The infection
is in their blood and saliva. One bite...

18
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:12,109
Stop... Stop! You've no idea.

19
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:21,119
Get it off. Help me!

20
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:28,316
Get it off! Get it off!

21
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:34,872
- What's the matter with her?
- You have to kill her.

22
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,030
Oh, my God.

23
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:46,272
- What's the matter with her?
- We have to kill her now.

24
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,153
Hello?

25
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,473
Hello?

26
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,791
Hello.

27
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:12,834
Hello?

28
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,513
Hello.

29
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,871
Hello?

30
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:31,551
Hello?

31
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:47,311
Father?

32
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:55,471
Father, are you OK?

33
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:05,080
Shouldn't have done that.

34
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,630
Shouldn't have done that.

35
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,837
Shit.

36
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:37,556
Over here.

37
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,550
- Over here.
- Come on.

38
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,875
Go, go, go.

39
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:02,955
Keep going.

40
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,793
- What the fuck is going on?
- Just shut up.

41
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,068
- Covered everything.
- Who are those people?

42
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:45,716
- Let's go. Let's go.
- What the fuck is going on?

43
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,071
Come on.

44
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:19,031
Man walks into a bar with a giraffe.
They each get pissed.

45
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:21,031
The giraffe falls over.

46
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:26,114
The man goes to leave and the barman says
''You can't leave that lying there.''

47
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:30,079
He says ''It's not a lion. It's a giraffe''.

48
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:40,153
He's completely humourless.

49
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:43,038
You two should get on like a house on fire.

50
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,471
So who are you?

51
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,471
You're from the hospital.

52
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:52,916
- Are you a doctor?
- He's not a doctor. He's a patient.

53
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,230
I'm a bicycle courier.

54
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:03,475
I was riding a package from Farringdon to
Shaftesbury Avenue and a car cut across me.

55
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:09,078
Then I wake up today in hospital.
I wake up and I'm hallucinating.

56
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:13,035
What's your name?

57
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,111
Jim.

58
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:18,320
I'm Mark. This is Selena.

59
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:24,152
OK, Jim.

60
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:31,594
I've got some bad news.

61
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:37,676
lt started as rioting, and right from
the beginning you knew this was different.

62
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:41,753
Because it was happening
in small villages, market towns.

63
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:45,239
And then it wasn't on the TV any more.

64
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:49,836
lt was in the street outside.
lt was coming through your windows.

65
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,672
lt was a virus.

66
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,478
An infection.

67
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:56,279
You didn't need a doctor to tell you that.

68
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:58,715
lt was the blood.

69
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:01,189
There was something in the blood.

70
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:07,355
By the time they tried to evacuate
the cities, it was already too late.

71
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:10,238
The infection was everywhere.

72
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,709
The army blockades were overrun.

73
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:16,794
And that's when the exodus started.

74
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:20,759
The day before broadcasting stopped,

75
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:24,355
there were reports of lnfection
in Paris and New York.

76
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:29,438
We didn't hear anything more after that.

77
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:35,113
- What's the government doing?
- There's no government.

78
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,555
Of course there's a government.

79
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:41,553
There's always a government.
They're in a bunker or a plane.

80
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:45,758
No, there's no government,
no police, no army.

81
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:50,118
No TV, no radio, no electricity.

82
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:54,713
You're the first uninfected person
we've seen in six days.

83
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,511
Where's your family?

84
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,356
They're dead. Like Selena's.

85
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:02,476
Yours will be dead too.

86
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:16,194
I have to find them.
They live in Deptford. I can walk it.

87
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:18,748
You'll go and come back, yeah?

88
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,790
You won't.

89
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:25,758
No one ever comes back.

90
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:32,071
So lesson one.

91
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:37,152
You never go anywhere alone
unless you've got no choice.

92
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:39,470
Lesson two.

93
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:43,473
Only travel during daylight.
Unless you've got no choice.

94
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,396
We'll take you tomorrow.

95
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:50,916
We'll all go and find
your dead parents together.

96
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,319
Eat.

97
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,037
lf you want her to slow down,
you'll have to say.

98
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:37,515
- lf there's anyone in there who...
- I understand.

99
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,474
Wait.

100
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:49,468
They died peacefully.
You should be grateful.

101
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:51,869
I'm not grateful.

102
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:59,992
My parents and my sister,
we went to Paddington Station,

103
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:07,640
hoping maybe we could get on a plane,
maybe we could buy our way onto a plane.

104
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,515
I remember my dad had all this cash,

105
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:13,797
even though cash was completely useless.

106
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:18,272
About 20,000 other people had the same idea.

107
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:22,796
Crowd was surging.

108
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,830
I lost my grip on my sister's hand.

109
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:30,150
I remember the ground was soft.

110
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:36,238
I looked down
and I was standing on all these people.

111
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:40,108
Like a carpet. People who had fallen and...

112
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:43,988
Somewhere in the crowd
there were lnfected. It spread fast.

113
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:47,277
No one could run.
All you could do was climb.

114
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:51,798
Climb over more people.
So I did that. I climbed.

115
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:54,155
And I got up on top of this kiosk.

116
00:24:56,360 --> 00:25:01,115
Looking down, you couldn't tell
which faces were infected and which weren't.

117
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:04,909
Then I saw my dad.
Not my mum or my sister.

118
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,877
My dad.

119
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:11,071
His face...

120
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:18,354
Selena's right.
You should be grateful.

121
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:23,389
We don't have time to get back to the shop
before dark. We should stay here tonight.

122
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:28,679
My room's up at the top.
You two can have that.

123
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:31,957
We'll all sleep in the same room. It's safer.

124
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:01,271
- You're back.
- Yeah.

125
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,391
- How was it?
- Fine.

126
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:12,635
Give me a drink of that, will ya?

127
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,711
It's empty.

128
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:23,151
I'll start working on them, then.

129
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,991
It's clear.

130
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:58,073
- That's Mr Bridges.
- Were you bitten?

131
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:00,276
And his daughter. From four doors down.

132
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:03,318
Were you bitten?

133
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:06,233
Did any of the blood get in your mouth?

134
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,672
Mark?

135
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,638
Wait.

136
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:40,716
Get that cleaned off.

137
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:44,511
Do you have any clothes here?

138
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:50,995
Then get them and get dressed.
We have to leave now.

139
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:54,595
More lnfected will be coming.
They always do.

140
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:25,078
How did you know?
How did you know he was infected?

141
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:28,914
- The blood.
- There was blood on me. It was on you.

142
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:34,154
I didn't know he was infected.
He knew. I could see it in his face.

143
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:38,472
lf someone gets infected,
you've about 20 seconds to kill them.

144
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:43,475
lt might be your brother, your sister
or your oldest friend. It makes no difference.

145
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:48,759
Just so you know where you stand,
if it happens to you, I'll do it in a heartbeat.

146
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:52,879
He was full of plans.
Have you got any plans?

147
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:57,238
Do you want us to find a cure and
save the world orjust fall in love and fuck?

148
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:59,709
Plans are pointless.

149
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:02,268
Staying alive's as good as it gets.

150
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:07,471
What's that?

151
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:15,311
Let's go.

152
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:01,592
What is it about tower blocks
and shopping trolleys?

153
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:04,638
Stop talking. It's a long way up.

154
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:16,190
Do you need a break?

155
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:19,271
- You?
- No.

156
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,831
Now I do need a break.

157
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:35,632
What's up?

158
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:37,631
Nothin'.

159
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:41,194
I got a headache.

160
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:42,713
- Bad?
- Pretty bad.

161
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:47,874
- Why didn't you say something before?
- I didn't think you'd give a shit.

162
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:53,113
You've got no fat on you
and all you've had to eat is sugar.

163
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,236
So you're crashing.

164
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:57,470
There isn't a lot we can do about that

165
00:31:57,560 --> 00:32:02,429
except pump you full of painkillers
and give you more sugar. As for sugar,

166
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:04,715
Pepsi or Lilt?

167
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:07,831
Do you have any Tango?

168
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:11,674
Actually,
I did have a can of Tango somewhere.

169
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:14,149
Quiet. That's an lnfected.

170
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:25,832
They're in. Move!

171
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:31,234
Wait up, Selena.

172
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:34,350
Wait for me, please!

173
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:38,470
- Wait for me.
- Come on.

174
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:40,471
- Run!
- Wait!

175
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:43,674
Please. For fuck's sake.

176
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:51,271
Down the corridor. Flat 157. Move.

177
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:53,351
Thank you.

178
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:07,276
Open the door.

179
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,153
Open the door.

180
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:21,069
- Open up.
- Where's Dad?

181
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:22,559
What?

182
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:27,918
- Open the fucking door.
- Where's Dad?

183
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,195
Let them in, Hannah. Let them inside.

184
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:39,995
Go in. Go in.

185
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:59,635
I'm Frank, anyway.

186
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:07,470
Good to meet you.
This is my daughter Hannah.

187
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:09,710
Come on, sweetheart. Say hello.

188
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:13,071
Come on.

189
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,591
This is great. Just great.

190
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:22,035
Calls for a celebration, I'd say.

191
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:25,032
Why don't you all sit down and...

192
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:27,953
Hannah, what have we got to offer?

193
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:30,429
We've got Mum's crème de menthe.

194
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:33,114
Great. Crème de menthe.

195
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:35,794
Yeah. Sit, please.

196
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:38,235
Get comfortable.

197
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:43,838
- Where are the bloody glasses?
- Middle cupboard.

198
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:46,673
Nah, the good ones. It's a celebration.

199
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:49,149
Top cupboard.

200
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:51,834
So this is your place?

201
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:54,712
It's nice.

202
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:11,478
I know it isn't much, but cheers.

203
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:13,232
Cheers.

204
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:35,871
You OK in there?

205
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:39,030
Yeah.

206
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:44,478
Sorry we couldn't spare the water.
Same with the toilet. The flush doesn't work.

207
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:48,230
You'll have to use the bucket.

208
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:57,034
Have to empty it each morning.

209
00:35:57,120 --> 00:36:00,635
Just chuck it over the balcony.
No mod cons here.

210
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:02,358
It's fine.

211
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:05,432
Listen, it's late. We're gonna turn in.

212
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,315
We have a spare room.

213
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:14,108
Are you and Selena...?

214
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:20,515
I'll take the living room. It's fine.

215
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:22,397
Right.

216
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:25,231
No, I mean, yeah.

217
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:32,038
- Goodnight, then.
- Goodnight, Frank.

218
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:47,559
Very spruce.

219
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:51,149
Very shredded.

220
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:59,269
- So what do you make of them?
- They're desperate.

221
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:03,079
Probably need us more than we need them.

222
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:06,630
I think they're good people.

223
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:12,193
- Good people?
- Yeah.

224
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:18,391
You should be more concerned about
whether they're gonna slow you down.

225
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:22,075
- Because if they slowed you down...
- I'd leave them behind.

226
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:23,991
- ln a heartbeat.
- Yeah.

227
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:26,272
I wouldn't.

228
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:29,750
Then you're gonna wind up
getting yourself killed.

229
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:40,149
I'm gonna get some sleep.

230
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:48,277
You think I don't get it, but I do get it.

231
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:53,914
And I know I'd be dead already
if I hadn't met you.

232
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:55,913
Sure.

233
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,513
No, look.

234
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:01,791
I mean, thank you.

235
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:06,910
And I mean, sure.

236
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,673
Goodnight, Jim.

237
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:11,751
Goodnight.

238
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,791
We lost water pressure three weeks ago.

239
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:30,839
I thought we'd be OK with the water
from the other flats. Cisterns and tanks.

240
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:33,992
But it vanishes so quick
you wouldn't believe.

241
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:38,798
You drink it,

242
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:40,598
it evaporates,

243
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:42,671
turns stagnant.

244
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,951
They're all empty.

245
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:49,711
Hasn't rained in ten days.

246
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:53,873
You can set up a plastic sheet
to catch dew and condensation.

247
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:57,555
Saw it on TV once, but I can't make it work.

248
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:00,831
You'd never think it.

249
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:04,553
Needing rain so badly.

250
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:08,469
Not in fucking England.

251
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:15,952
We're not going to be able to stay here.

252
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:28,115
- There's been no broadcasts for weeks.
- Just listen.

253
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:32,591
Salvation is here.
The answer to lnfection is here.

254
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:35,558
lf you can hear this, you're not alone.

255
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:39,952
There are others like you.
There are other survivors.

256
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:42,156
We are soldiers and we are armed.

257
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:45,391
Oh, my God. Soldiers.

258
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:49,871
- Quiet. There's more.
- Our location is the 42nd blockade, M602,

259
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:53,236
27 miles northeast of Manchester.

260
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:57,074
- You must find us. Salvation is...
- Now itjust repeats.

261
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:59,435
- It's a recording?
- Yeah.

262
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:02,318
But this is where it's telling us to go.

263
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,470
Just there.

264
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:10,516
The way things are, we might need
two or three days to get up there.

265
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:12,238
''We''?

266
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:21,996
Sound carries in this flat. Me and Hannah
<i>do</i> need you more than you need us.

267
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:25,117
- I didn't...
- It's OK. It's the truth.

268
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:27,589
I can't leave the block if it's the two of us.

269
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:31,468
Something might happen to me.
Hannah'd be alone. I couldn't risk it.

270
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:33,198
But with other people...

271
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:37,398
lf it's a recording,
the soldiers who made it could be dead.

272
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:40,836
- It's possible.
- That stuff about the answer to lnfection.

273
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:45,038
There is no answer.
It's already done all the damage it can.

274
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:47,839
- Maybe they have a cure.
- Maybe they've got nothing.

275
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:51,833
- The only way to find out is to reach them.
- We could die trying.

276
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:56,035
Or die here.

277
00:40:56,120 --> 00:41:01,592
Anyway, it isn't true what Dad said.
You need us just the same as we need you.

278
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:04,837
We need each other.

279
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:09,994
And we'll never be safe in the cities.
The soldiers could keep us safe.

280
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:12,671
We have to try and get there.

281
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:15,273
Get there how?

282
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:29,835
Just so you know,
I don't take cheques or credit cards.

283
00:41:57,240 --> 00:42:00,118
- What do you think?
- It's the most direct route.

284
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:05,228
Then we should take the indirect route.
The one in daylight and not underground.

285
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:07,550
Let's just get it done.

286
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:24,509
No. See, this is a really shit idea.

287
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:28,591
You know why?
Because it's <i>obviously</i> a shit idea.

288
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:32,878
We're gonna drive into the tunnel
full of fucking smashed cars.

289
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:35,758
It's really fucking obviously a shit idea.

290
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:37,990
Hold on.

291
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:48,597
Dad!

292
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:08,719
Fuck.

293
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:12,269
The world's worst place to get a flat.

294
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:15,557
Agreed. I think we'd better do this quick.

295
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:20,030
I've got the wheel. You're on the jack.

296
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:37,430
Do you hear that? Hey, do you hear that?

297
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:39,511
Hear what?

298
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:42,355
I've done it.

299
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:45,359
Dad?

300
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,673
Jesus Christ.

301
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:53,519
Fucking rats.

302
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:06,108
They're running from the lnfected.

303
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:08,031
Move it.

304
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:12,238
Forget the jack, Hannah.
There's no time. Just lift, everyone.

305
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:15,437
Grab hold. One, two, three, lift!

306
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:26,555
- Don't look at them.
- I can see them. They're coming.

307
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:34,508
Come on, Hannah.

308
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:36,909
Almost.

309
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,798
- Get the tyre on.
- I'm trying.

310
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:46,960
Three, two, one,

311
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:48,678
drop it.

312
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:54,995
- Get in the car.
- Come on.

313
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,275
- Frank, drive.
- Move it!

314
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:10,671
Goodbye, you fuckers.

315
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:20,515
Stop the cab.

316
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:44,755
Let's shop.

317
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:56,393
You...

318
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:02,988
Anybody seen any buns?

319
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:06,430
lrradiated.

320
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:11,796
Don't take anything that needs to be cooked.

321
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:13,632
I think you can eat that raw.

322
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:15,517
Decaffeinated coffee...

323
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:17,591
Put that back.

324
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:20,910
Can'tjust take any crap.

325
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:25,312
lf I never see another chocolate bar again,
it'll be too soon.

326
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:28,280
Not counting Terry's Chocolate Orange.

327
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:33,310
Single malt, 16-year-old. ''Dark, full flavour.''

328
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:37,152
''Warm but not aggressive.''

329
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:39,549
''Peaty aftertaste.''

330
00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:44,197
''Takes out the fire but leaves in the warmth.''

331
00:47:36,840 --> 00:47:39,798
Either we do this now or we're walking.

332
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:48,511
Not you.

333
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:53,915
- Stay close, Jim.
- What?

334
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,991
You heard.

335
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:23,471
Where are you going?

336
00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:26,829
We've got enough food.

337
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:29,150
We don't have any cheeseburgers.

338
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:32,440
Like going on holidays with your aunt.

339
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:38,639
Hello?

340
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:53,598
I hate you!

341
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:04,391
Find anything?

342
00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:09,233
- Find anything?
- No. Let's get outta here.

343
00:50:09,320 --> 00:50:11,311
We're done here.

344
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:15,237
OK, Hannah.

345
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:23,912
Easy. Brake.

346
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,991
Brake, brake.

347
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:35,511
Out.

348
00:51:19,720 --> 00:51:21,995
Oh, my God.

349
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:24,958
I can, like, taste the vitamin C.

350
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:29,514
The raisins are so moist.

351
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:31,591
What did you say?

352
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:34,353
The raisins. They're so moist.

353
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:40,911
Look over here.

354
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:53,512
Like a family.

355
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:55,955
Do you think they're infected?

356
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:04,274
They're doing just fine.

357
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:11,791
Come on. Let's eat.

358
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:27,154
Know what I was thinking?

359
00:52:27,240 --> 00:52:30,789
That you'll never hear
another piece of original music again.

360
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:34,873
You'll never read a book
that hasn't already been written,

361
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:39,555
or see a film that hasn't already been shot.

362
00:52:44,840 --> 00:52:46,990
That's what <i>you</i> were thinking.

363
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:48,877
No.

364
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:52,275
I was thinking I was wrong.

365
00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:55,471
About what?

366
00:52:57,120 --> 00:52:59,111
All the death.

367
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:01,671
All this shit.

368
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:07,552
lt doesn't really mean anything
to Frank and Hannah because...

369
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:12,190
she's got her dad and he's got his daughter.

370
00:53:12,280 --> 00:53:14,316
Cheeky monkey.

371
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:18,230
I was wrong when I said
staying alive is as good as it gets.

372
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:24,109
<i>That's</i> what I was thinking.

373
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:29,669
You stole my thought.

374
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:35,277
Sorry.

375
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:37,997
That's OK.

376
00:53:38,080 --> 00:53:40,071
You can keep it.

377
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:44,994
It's getting late.
We'd better stay here for the night.

378
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:01,874
I can't sleep.

379
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:04,474
Me neither.

380
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:06,835
Doesn't feel safe, does it?

381
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:08,911
Outside like this.

382
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:12,069
We're safe enough.

383
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:14,720
Selena didn't seem to have any trouble.

384
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:17,789
I noticed that.

385
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:21,391
What? What is it?

386
00:54:22,680 --> 00:54:24,636
How'd you get to sleep?

387
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:34,549
Bloody hell. Must've needed
a hell of a prescription for that lot.

388
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:38,758
I didn't need a prescription.
I qualified as a chemist.

389
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:41,274
Great. Valium.

390
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:43,828
Not only will we be able to get to sleep

391
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:47,469
but if we're attacked in the middle
of the night, we won't even care.

392
00:54:47,560 --> 00:54:49,710
- Two each.
- Not for me, thanks.

393
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:51,756
Can l, Dad?

394
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:53,751
I don't think so, sweetheart.

395
00:54:53,840 --> 00:54:55,273
Please?

396
00:54:56,720 --> 00:54:58,711
- No.
- I can't sleep.

397
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:04,274
Come on, Frank. Let her live a little.

398
00:55:05,320 --> 00:55:09,154
- Give her half of one.
- All right. We're on.

399
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:21,277
Night-night.

400
00:55:22,040 --> 00:55:24,554
You're a big softie, Frank.

401
00:56:05,160 --> 00:56:07,151
Hello? Hello!

402
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:09,354
Hello!

403
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:11,829
Hello! Hello!

404
00:56:22,920 --> 00:56:25,593
You're having a bad dream, that's all.

405
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:30,231
Thanks, Dad.

406
00:57:04,080 --> 00:57:06,548
Come on, sleepyhead.

407
00:57:10,080 --> 00:57:12,071
Come on, Babe Ruth.

408
00:57:15,160 --> 00:57:16,957
Hurry up.

409
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:21,996
- Did I miss breakfast?
- You'll sleep through anything.

410
00:57:22,080 --> 00:57:26,870
- Did you have a fry-up?
- We'll stop at a pub on the way. Door.

411
00:57:50,440 --> 00:57:54,752
Our location is the 42nd blockade, the M602,

412
00:57:54,840 --> 00:57:57,798
27 miles northeast of Manchester.

413
00:57:57,880 --> 00:57:59,711
You must find us. Please.

414
00:57:59,800 --> 00:58:01,836
Salvation is here.

415
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:04,832
The answer to lnfection is here.

416
00:58:35,560 --> 00:58:37,551
Must be Manchester.

417
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:42,911
The whole of Manchester, the whole city.

418
00:58:44,680 --> 00:58:46,910
No fire crews to put it out.

419
00:59:39,480 --> 00:59:41,948
42nd blockade.

420
00:59:42,040 --> 00:59:44,270
This is it.

421
01:00:52,520 --> 01:00:56,354
I don't understand, Dad. Did they leave?

422
01:00:56,440 --> 01:00:59,432
- I don't like this. I think we should go.
- No.

423
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:10,630
Vehicles. We should check the vehicles.
There has to be something.

424
01:01:28,040 --> 01:01:29,871
Nothing.

425
01:01:29,960 --> 01:01:31,791
I can't believe it.

426
01:01:38,120 --> 01:01:39,712
We have to go.

427
01:01:39,800 --> 01:01:42,189
Go fucking where?

428
01:02:19,720 --> 01:02:21,790
Get out of it.

429
01:02:25,160 --> 01:02:27,151
Get out of it.

430
01:02:44,240 --> 01:02:46,708
Dad, are you all right?

431
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:49,360
I'm fine, sweetheart.

432
01:02:50,240 --> 01:02:52,834
Sorry I lost my temper.

433
01:02:52,920 --> 01:02:54,956
Hannah?

434
01:02:55,040 --> 01:02:57,873
I love you very much.

435
01:02:57,960 --> 01:02:59,871
- What?
- Keep away from me.

436
01:02:59,960 --> 01:03:02,190
Stay where you are.

437
01:03:02,280 --> 01:03:05,078
- Dad?
- Keep away from me. Keep away from me.

438
01:03:05,160 --> 01:03:07,549
Keep away! Keep away! Keep away!

439
01:03:07,640 --> 01:03:10,632
- Dad!
- Keep away! Keep away!

440
01:03:12,080 --> 01:03:14,719
What's wrong? Dad!

441
01:03:18,840 --> 01:03:21,149
Jim! He's infected.

442
01:03:21,240 --> 01:03:23,754
- No!
- Now, Jim.

443
01:03:23,840 --> 01:03:27,116
- Kill him!
- Dad!

444
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:28,428
Kill him!

445
01:03:36,560 --> 01:03:38,755
Stay away from him.

446
01:03:39,960 --> 01:03:42,269
Keep away from the body.

447
01:03:44,920 --> 01:03:46,717
Dad?

448
01:04:08,200 --> 01:04:10,760
Three survivors. One male, two female.

449
01:04:10,840 --> 01:04:14,037
I repeat, one male, two female.

450
01:04:14,120 --> 01:04:16,588
ETA, 15.

451
01:04:16,680 --> 01:04:19,035
Put the kettle on.

452
01:05:05,040 --> 01:05:07,429
I'm Major Henry West.

453
01:05:08,640 --> 01:05:10,631
Welcome.

454
01:05:16,200 --> 01:05:20,876
We've got beds with clean sheets
and a boiler that produces hot water.

455
01:05:20,960 --> 01:05:23,269
You can all have a shower.

456
01:05:23,360 --> 01:05:26,557
You look like you need one. Please.

457
01:05:45,680 --> 01:05:50,674
lt ain't funny. I got loads of cooking to do,
you fucking Doris.

458
01:05:51,720 --> 01:05:53,756
Run him over.

459
01:05:56,360 --> 01:05:59,033
How is she doing?

460
01:05:59,120 --> 01:06:02,157
She's lost her dad. That's how she is.

461
01:06:04,720 --> 01:06:07,109
It's all fucked.

462
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:09,111
What do you mean?

463
01:06:13,960 --> 01:06:17,396
Don't do that.
Come on, come on, come on.

464
01:06:17,480 --> 01:06:19,471
Don't do that.

465
01:06:21,080 --> 01:06:25,870
Hannah is what Frank says she is. Tough,
strong, and she'll cope just like I'll cope.

466
01:06:25,960 --> 01:06:29,714
- Just like you'll cope.
- I don't want her to have to fucking cope.

467
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:33,269
I want her to be OK.

468
01:06:34,800 --> 01:06:36,870
When Hannah had her dad it was OK.

469
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:39,633
lt was OK for them and it was OK for us.

470
01:06:42,840 --> 01:06:45,149
Now it's all just fucked.

471
01:07:15,320 --> 01:07:18,039
So you heard our broadcast?

472
01:07:18,120 --> 01:07:21,476
- We did.
- We must be a disappointment.

473
01:07:21,560 --> 01:07:27,430
You were hoping for a full brigade. An army
base with helicopters and a field hospital.

474
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:33,753
- We were just hoping for...
- The answer to lnfection.

475
01:07:38,080 --> 01:07:42,392
As I said before, it's here. Though
it may not be quite what you imagined.

476
01:07:42,760 --> 01:07:45,558
- Just feel lucky to have found you.
- You were lucky.

477
01:07:45,640 --> 01:07:48,632
The fire drove hundreds of lnfected
out of Manchester.

478
01:07:48,720 --> 01:07:51,678
The surrounding area's teeming with them.

479
01:07:53,360 --> 01:07:55,874
But don't worry.

480
01:07:55,960 --> 01:07:58,349
You're quite safe here.

481
01:08:01,320 --> 01:08:06,952
Flat terrain all round the house. Floodlights
which we've rigged up to a generator.

482
01:08:07,960 --> 01:08:10,428
High perimeter wall which helps.

483
01:08:10,520 --> 01:08:14,593
And we've been lacing the ground
with tripwires and land mines.

484
01:08:14,680 --> 01:08:19,151
You wouldn't want to mow the lawn,
but if they get in, we hear them.

485
01:08:22,280 --> 01:08:26,990
Secondary to protection,
our real job is to rebuild. Start again.

486
01:08:27,080 --> 01:08:29,389
The belly of the house. The heart.

487
01:08:29,480 --> 01:08:34,508
A wood-fired boiler providing us with hot
water. The first step towards civilisation.

488
01:08:34,600 --> 01:08:36,591
The kitchen.

489
01:08:36,680 --> 01:08:38,716
Here you are. I'll swap you.

490
01:08:38,800 --> 01:08:41,872
- Now don't be throwing it.
- Give us some.

491
01:08:41,960 --> 01:08:45,839
Don't be fighting.
Will you put that back? Put it back.

492
01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:48,195
Jones, our resident tin opener.

493
01:08:48,280 --> 01:08:51,158
- What are you cooking, Jones?
- Surprise, sir.

494
01:08:51,760 --> 01:08:53,751
I can't wait.

495
01:09:00,960 --> 01:09:03,110
And lastly, meet Mailer.

496
01:09:06,760 --> 01:09:08,637
Mailer, Jim.

497
01:09:08,720 --> 01:09:10,756
Jim, Mailer.

498
01:09:12,040 --> 01:09:14,474
Got infected two days ago.

499
01:09:14,560 --> 01:09:19,429
Mitchell managed to knock him out cold
and we got a chain round his neck.

500
01:09:23,880 --> 01:09:25,871
Keeping him alive?

501
01:09:26,800 --> 01:09:30,679
The idea was to learn something
about lnfection.

502
01:09:31,960 --> 01:09:33,951
Have him teach me.

503
01:09:40,360 --> 01:09:42,351
Has he?

504
01:09:44,440 --> 01:09:46,510
ln a way.

505
01:09:52,440 --> 01:09:55,716
He's telling me he'll never bake bread.

506
01:09:55,800 --> 01:09:57,870
Farm crops,

507
01:09:57,960 --> 01:10:00,520
raise livestock.

508
01:10:00,600 --> 01:10:02,909
He's telling me he's futureless.

509
01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:12,034
And eventually he'll tell me how long
the lnfected take to starve to death.

510
01:10:50,160 --> 01:10:52,515
You'll have to wait and see

511
01:10:52,600 --> 01:10:54,750
Hope it's chips, it's chips

512
01:10:54,840 --> 01:10:57,308
We hope it's chips, it's chips

513
01:11:05,520 --> 01:11:07,829
Hat.

514
01:11:07,920 --> 01:11:10,309
What have we here?

515
01:11:13,040 --> 01:11:16,271
Tinned ham, tinned peas, tinned beans and...

516
01:11:20,840 --> 01:11:23,479
- Nice one, Doris.
- Omelette.

517
01:11:23,560 --> 01:11:25,915
- It's a feast, Jones.
- Honour of our guests.

518
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:29,072
Absolutely. I was going to propose a toast

519
01:11:29,160 --> 01:11:32,152
but this omelette will do just as well.

520
01:11:34,640 --> 01:11:37,029
- To new friends.
- New friends.

521
01:11:47,080 --> 01:11:50,834
Jones, did you notice while cooking
that these eggs were off?

522
01:11:50,920 --> 01:11:54,196
I thought the salt might cover the taste, sir.

523
01:11:54,280 --> 01:11:56,077
Get rid of it.

524
01:11:58,440 --> 01:12:00,795
Doris, you twat.

525
01:12:00,880 --> 01:12:03,553
I don't suppose you can cook, can you?

526
01:12:04,360 --> 01:12:09,593
I can't tell you how badly we need
someone with a little flair in the kitchen.

527
01:12:09,680 --> 01:12:14,037
What a fucking disappointment.
I saw those eggs, I thought it was Christmas.

528
01:12:14,120 --> 01:12:17,237
We'll have eggs again.
Once everything's back to normal.

529
01:12:17,320 --> 01:12:20,039
You muppet. Look at him.

530
01:12:20,120 --> 01:12:23,999
He's still waiting
for Marks and Spencer's to reopen.

531
01:12:24,080 --> 01:12:28,232
- You don't know nothing.
- I think Bill's got a point.

532
01:12:28,320 --> 01:12:31,312
lf you look at the whole life of the planet,

533
01:12:33,320 --> 01:12:37,279
Man has only been around
for a few blinks of an eye.

534
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,355
So if the infection wipes us all out,

535
01:12:41,320 --> 01:12:43,515
that <i>is</i> a return to normality.

536
01:12:47,360 --> 01:12:50,238
- That what you meant, Bill?
- Yeah.

537
01:12:50,320 --> 01:12:53,437
Have you met our New Age sergeant?

538
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:56,114
Our spiritual guru.

539
01:12:56,200 --> 01:13:01,194
Tell me, Farrell, exactly why
did you join the army in the first place?

540
01:13:03,880 --> 01:13:07,839
This is what I've seen
in the four weeks since lnfection.

541
01:13:07,920 --> 01:13:10,434
People killing people.

542
01:13:10,520 --> 01:13:14,877
Which is what I saw in the four weeks before
lnfection, the four weeks before that...

543
01:13:14,960 --> 01:13:20,193
As far back as I care to remember,
people killing people.

544
01:13:20,280 --> 01:13:23,750
Which to my mind
puts us in a state of normality now.

545
01:13:31,720 --> 01:13:34,553
- You're not eating?
- I don't want to eat.

546
01:13:34,640 --> 01:13:37,313
You must eat, Hannah.

547
01:13:37,400 --> 01:13:40,517
I don't want to eat.
I want to bury my dad.

548
01:13:41,400 --> 01:13:44,392
He's one of the people you're talking about.

549
01:13:48,320 --> 01:13:50,276
Let's go.

550
01:13:53,280 --> 01:13:55,475
Move. Move. Move.

551
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:05,991
Enemy in front.

552
01:14:37,480 --> 01:14:39,869
I fucking got one.

553
01:14:39,960 --> 01:14:43,430
What do you want, a fucking sweetie?
Keep shooting, you cunt.

554
01:14:55,560 --> 01:14:57,755
Fucking hell. He bounced.

555
01:14:57,840 --> 01:14:59,353
Cease fire.

556
01:14:59,440 --> 01:15:01,635
I ain't never seen that in my life.

557
01:15:01,720 --> 01:15:04,280
- Report clear.
- Fucking hell.

558
01:15:04,360 --> 01:15:05,998
- Clear.
- Clear.

559
01:15:06,080 --> 01:15:07,149
Yeah, yeah, clear.

560
01:15:18,400 --> 01:15:20,391
Hello.

561
01:15:23,360 --> 01:15:28,753
Listen, sweetheart, you ain't
gonna be needing this any more.

562
01:15:28,840 --> 01:15:30,956
Cos you got me to protect you now.

563
01:15:32,680 --> 01:15:37,754
You wanna get your hands on a really
big chopper, you just come and see me.

564
01:15:37,840 --> 01:15:39,239
Fuck you.

565
01:15:39,320 --> 01:15:41,390
- That's an offer.
- Give her some.

566
01:15:41,480 --> 01:15:43,391
How about right now?

567
01:15:44,040 --> 01:15:45,837
Mitchell.

568
01:15:47,360 --> 01:15:51,672
Easy, tiger. You don't wanna go
picking a fight with me, son.

569
01:15:52,920 --> 01:15:55,434
Sergeant Farrell.

570
01:15:59,080 --> 01:16:01,992
- Mitchell, first action on.
- Resecure the perimeter.

571
01:16:02,080 --> 01:16:05,390
Then get to it. Jones, Bedford, go with him.

572
01:16:07,520 --> 01:16:09,511
Slow down.

573
01:16:12,520 --> 01:16:15,353
- Sergeant?
- Sir.

574
01:16:15,440 --> 01:16:18,034
Clear the bodies off the lawn.

575
01:16:20,800 --> 01:16:23,268
The rest of you, go with him.

576
01:16:30,160 --> 01:16:32,151
My apologies.

577
01:16:35,760 --> 01:16:37,432
Drink?

578
01:16:42,120 --> 01:16:44,680
Look, we're grateful, OK?

579
01:16:44,760 --> 01:16:48,799
We're very grateful for your protection
but if we're gonna stay here...

580
01:16:48,880 --> 01:16:50,359
- Who have you killed?
- No one.

581
01:16:50,440 --> 01:16:55,389
Who have you killed? You wouldn't be alive
now if you hadn't killed somebody.

582
01:17:03,400 --> 01:17:05,595
I killed a boy.

583
01:17:09,520 --> 01:17:11,511
A child?

584
01:17:12,840 --> 01:17:14,831
Yes.

585
01:17:16,520 --> 01:17:21,116
But you had to.
Otherwise he'd have killed you.

586
01:17:24,520 --> 01:17:26,317
Survival.

587
01:17:29,600 --> 01:17:31,591
I understand.

588
01:17:33,880 --> 01:17:36,269
I promised them women.

589
01:17:38,160 --> 01:17:40,151
What?

590
01:17:41,240 --> 01:17:44,869
Eight days ago I found Jones
with his gun in his mouth.

591
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:50,516
He said he was going to kill himself
because there was no future.

592
01:17:50,600 --> 01:17:53,353
What could I say to him?

593
01:17:53,440 --> 01:17:58,434
We fight off the lnfected or we wait
until they starve to death and then what?

594
01:17:59,320 --> 01:18:02,995
What do nine men do
except wait to die themselves?

595
01:18:03,080 --> 01:18:08,950
I moved us from the blockade, I set the radio
broadcasting and I promised them women.

596
01:18:13,120 --> 01:18:15,395
Because women mean a future.

597
01:18:23,080 --> 01:18:25,071
Selena. Hannah.

598
01:18:25,800 --> 01:18:27,711
- What is it?
- We have to go.

599
01:18:27,800 --> 01:18:29,597
No time. Come on.

600
01:18:32,440 --> 01:18:34,396
Come on.

601
01:18:35,480 --> 01:18:37,357
We get in the car and we go.

602
01:18:38,680 --> 01:18:43,037
No! You're not going to keep them here.
You've got to let them go.

603
01:18:43,120 --> 01:18:46,237
You can't keep them here.
Stay where you are.

604
01:18:46,320 --> 01:18:48,914
I'm not gonna let you keep them here.

605
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:50,831
You can't do this.

606
01:18:53,320 --> 01:18:55,515
Get him.

607
01:19:02,280 --> 01:19:04,510
I want to give you a chance.

608
01:19:04,600 --> 01:19:06,636
You can be with us.

609
01:19:08,200 --> 01:19:10,395
But I can't let them go.

610
01:19:15,800 --> 01:19:18,268
OK, Jim? OK.

611
01:19:22,760 --> 01:19:24,751
Him too.

612
01:19:37,320 --> 01:19:39,959
Smithers says
''Women and semen don't mix.''

613
01:19:40,040 --> 01:19:42,838
Mr Burns says
''We all know what you think, Smithers.''

614
01:19:42,920 --> 01:19:45,718
And that was my favourite joke
in <i>The Simpsons.</i>

615
01:19:45,800 --> 01:19:49,270
That's what they're doing a few
hundred miles away, across the Channel,

616
01:19:49,360 --> 01:19:53,592
across the Atlantic. Eating dinner
and watching the fucking <i>Simpsons.</i>

617
01:19:53,680 --> 01:19:56,831
They're sleeping in their beds
next to their wives.

618
01:19:56,920 --> 01:20:02,392
But we're here chained to a fucking radiator
because the OC has gone insane.

619
01:20:03,400 --> 01:20:07,279
Starting the world again when the rest
of the world hasn't even stopped.

620
01:20:08,600 --> 01:20:11,592
Just imagine, just think about it.

621
01:20:12,600 --> 01:20:14,795
How could lnfection cross the oceans?

622
01:20:14,880 --> 01:20:18,998
How could it cross the mountains
and the rivers? It can be stopped.

623
01:20:19,080 --> 01:20:21,674
Right now TVs are playing
and planes are flying

624
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:25,594
and the rest of the world
is continuing as fucking normal.

625
01:20:25,680 --> 01:20:28,877
Think. Actually <i>think</i> about it.

626
01:20:29,720 --> 01:20:33,156
What would you do
with a diseased little island?

627
01:20:37,160 --> 01:20:39,151
They quarantined us.

628
01:20:41,560 --> 01:20:45,758
''There is no lnfection.
It's just people killing people.'' He's insane.

629
01:20:54,200 --> 01:20:56,555
Time to go.

630
01:20:57,880 --> 01:20:59,871
Quarantine?

631
01:21:30,400 --> 01:21:33,392
- Please...
- Believe me, I'm not interested.

632
01:21:34,440 --> 01:21:39,355
You see, I'm gonna have the black one.
And I'm gonna make her squirm.

633
01:21:39,440 --> 01:21:43,194
Mitchell, I swear to God
it's gonna end badly for you.

634
01:21:43,280 --> 01:21:44,918
Move.

635
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:46,797
Come on, move. Get up.

636
01:21:46,880 --> 01:21:48,871
Get up, you cunt. Fucking move.

637
01:21:48,960 --> 01:21:50,439
Get up.

638
01:21:50,520 --> 01:21:52,670
Move your fucking arse.

639
01:22:12,840 --> 01:22:16,116
Come on then, you fucking pansies.
Do me first.

640
01:22:16,200 --> 01:22:18,589
No, Mitch. Just use the gat.

641
01:22:18,680 --> 01:22:21,592
- So you're gonna stick me?
- Shoot 'em.

642
01:22:21,680 --> 01:22:24,240
- Why?
- Because it's fucking quicker.

643
01:22:24,320 --> 01:22:27,232
ls that how you'd let
your sergeant go out, Jones?

644
01:22:27,320 --> 01:22:29,151
- I'll shoot them.
- No, you won't.

645
01:22:29,240 --> 01:22:32,550
You'll let him stick me?
Like a fucking dog?

646
01:22:36,040 --> 01:22:37,837
I'm gonna enjoy this.

647
01:22:41,480 --> 01:22:45,268
You stupid cunt. What are you doing?
You wanna shoot me?

648
01:22:45,360 --> 01:22:49,353
- You wanna shoot me? I'll kill you.
- Where's he fucking gone?

649
01:22:50,560 --> 01:22:53,279
Fuck it. Get up. Get after him.

650
01:22:55,680 --> 01:22:58,752
- Jones, move it.
- I can see him. I can see him.

651
01:22:58,840 --> 01:23:00,831
Where are you?

652
01:23:08,120 --> 01:23:10,918
- Can you see him?
- Through there.

653
01:23:18,360 --> 01:23:20,749
Oh no. We're fucked.

654
01:23:21,880 --> 01:23:23,313
We're fucked.

655
01:23:23,400 --> 01:23:24,719
Relax.

656
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:28,110
He's over the wall. He's got no vehicle.

657
01:23:28,200 --> 01:23:30,839
And no shooter.

658
01:23:30,920 --> 01:23:32,194
He's dead.

659
01:24:05,560 --> 01:24:09,348
The first thing we're going to do
is make you look more presentable.

660
01:24:09,440 --> 01:24:12,876
The lady of the house
has an extensive wardrobe

661
01:24:12,960 --> 01:24:15,394
which she certainly has no use for.

662
01:24:16,360 --> 01:24:18,112
You can't do it to Hannah.

663
01:24:18,200 --> 01:24:21,749
Go to the master bedroom,
pick out a wide selection.

664
01:24:21,840 --> 01:24:23,831
Yes, sir.

665
01:24:30,080 --> 01:24:32,071
Ladies...

666
01:24:34,720 --> 01:24:37,393
Come on. It's only dressing up.

667
01:24:37,480 --> 01:24:40,711
- I thought girls liked dressing up.
- Expensive dresses.

668
01:24:42,400 --> 01:24:44,391
Whoa, whoa, relax.

669
01:24:45,440 --> 01:24:46,953
Selena!

670
01:24:58,680 --> 01:25:02,639
You need to leave me alone
with Hannah. OK?

671
01:25:04,440 --> 01:25:07,989
- Listen. The OC wants...
- He wants us to dress up nice.

672
01:25:08,080 --> 01:25:12,073
lf you want us to get changed,
you have to leave the room. OK?

673
01:25:22,600 --> 01:25:24,875
It's just polite.

674
01:25:30,600 --> 01:25:33,034
All right.

675
01:25:34,880 --> 01:25:37,633
Come on, lads. Let's leave the room.

676
01:25:59,760 --> 01:26:03,548
We're gonna eat these, Hannah.
Come on. Eat these.

677
01:26:03,640 --> 01:26:05,710
Are you trying to kill me?

678
01:26:05,840 --> 01:26:07,956
No, sweetheart.

679
01:26:08,040 --> 01:26:10,474
I'm making you not care.

680
01:26:11,720 --> 01:26:13,870
What you doing?

681
01:26:18,240 --> 01:26:20,629
- Someone's at the blockade.
- Jim!

682
01:26:21,960 --> 01:26:24,520
Stay here and put the dresses on.

683
01:26:24,600 --> 01:26:26,079
Let's go. Go.

684
01:26:30,120 --> 01:26:32,588
He went over the wall.
We thought he'd be dead.

685
01:26:32,680 --> 01:26:35,240
Shut up, Jones. Stay here.

686
01:28:38,520 --> 01:28:40,511
Davis?

687
01:29:13,800 --> 01:29:15,552
Fuck it.

688
01:30:05,160 --> 01:30:08,197
- What was that?
- Lightning.

689
01:30:09,080 --> 01:30:11,071
I heard something.

690
01:30:13,240 --> 01:30:15,595
lt sounded like a Claymore to me.

691
01:30:16,600 --> 01:30:20,388
All right, I'll go and hit the floods,
take a butcher's.

692
01:30:21,160 --> 01:30:22,957
Girls,

693
01:30:23,040 --> 01:30:25,554
keep an eye on him, will ya?

694
01:30:35,800 --> 01:30:38,109
Those pills,

695
01:30:38,200 --> 01:30:40,589
I think they're having an effect.

696
01:30:40,680 --> 01:30:43,069
I can feel them.

697
01:30:44,160 --> 01:30:46,435
I don't feel sleepy.

698
01:30:51,280 --> 01:30:53,669
They've been a long time.

699
01:30:55,520 --> 01:30:58,273
What are you gonna do
if they don't come back?

700
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:01,958
Would you be the officer if Henry was dead?

701
01:31:02,040 --> 01:31:03,951
ls that the way it works?

702
01:31:04,040 --> 01:31:06,031
Shut up.

703
01:31:07,360 --> 01:31:11,273
I don't think they are coming back.
I think they've been killed.

704
01:31:11,360 --> 01:31:13,828
I said shut up.

705
01:31:15,360 --> 01:31:17,351
They're dead.

706
01:31:18,360 --> 01:31:20,749
And you're gonna be next.

707
01:31:26,680 --> 01:31:28,875
Get up.

708
01:31:29,440 --> 01:31:32,432
We're gonna get out of here.
Stay with it, Hannah.

709
01:31:32,520 --> 01:31:35,239
Don't worry. I feel fine. Really.

710
01:31:36,480 --> 01:31:38,471
Get him off me.

711
01:31:43,640 --> 01:31:45,471
It's Jones. It's Jones.

712
01:31:57,520 --> 01:32:02,230
Where the fuck are you going?
What's all the fucking shouting about?

713
01:32:09,360 --> 01:32:12,591
Don'tjust stand there,
you soppy cunt. Get after them.

714
01:32:12,680 --> 01:32:14,591
You two, in there. Move.

715
01:32:32,160 --> 01:32:34,037
Come on, then.

716
01:32:34,120 --> 01:32:36,953
What the fuck you gonna do now?

717
01:33:02,440 --> 01:33:06,035
Defend these stairs with your fucking life.

718
01:33:06,120 --> 01:33:08,156
Mailer's loose.

719
01:34:17,480 --> 01:34:19,471
Sorry.

720
01:34:55,480 --> 01:34:57,471
Hannah?

721
01:35:57,440 --> 01:36:01,638
I haven't got any bullets.
I haven't got any fucking bullets.

722
01:36:05,920 --> 01:36:08,480
Don't fucking leave me.

723
01:36:51,760 --> 01:36:53,432
Come on.

724
01:36:55,320 --> 01:36:57,276
Move.

725
01:36:57,360 --> 01:36:59,874
Move. Move.

726
01:37:02,440 --> 01:37:07,036
It's just you and me now, darlin'.
But don't worry, I'll get you out of here.

727
01:37:07,120 --> 01:37:11,398
Then we'll find a nice little fucking place
somewhere. Just you and me.

728
01:37:11,480 --> 01:37:13,710
And we'll live happy ever after.

729
01:38:15,440 --> 01:38:17,829
That was longer than a heartbeat.

730
01:38:20,560 --> 01:38:22,551
Jim?

731
01:38:31,520 --> 01:38:34,910
Listen. It's not all fucked.

732
01:38:40,440 --> 01:38:42,829
We're gonna be OK. It's not all fucked.

733
01:38:42,920 --> 01:38:46,117
- I've got to explain something.
- Shut up.

734
01:38:46,840 --> 01:38:49,035
It's gonna be OK.

735
01:38:54,280 --> 01:38:57,716
Hannah, it's OK. He's not infected.

736
01:38:57,800 --> 01:38:59,791
I thought he was biting you.

737
01:38:59,880 --> 01:39:04,192
- I was kissing her. Are you stoned?
- It's a long story.

738
01:39:04,280 --> 01:39:06,714
We have to get out of here. Come on.

739
01:39:09,400 --> 01:39:11,391
Come on. Move.

740
01:39:18,120 --> 01:39:20,190
You killed all my boys.

741
01:39:20,280 --> 01:39:21,872
Wait.

742
01:39:28,960 --> 01:39:30,393
Hannah!

743
01:39:30,480 --> 01:39:32,038
Hannah?

744
01:39:51,240 --> 01:39:52,753
Get in.

745
01:40:10,960 --> 01:40:12,678
They're locked.

746
01:40:12,760 --> 01:40:15,069
The gates are locked.

747
01:40:17,600 --> 01:40:19,591
Fucking do it.

748
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:43,309
Come on, Jim, breathe. Fucking breathe.

749
01:41:03,240 --> 01:41:05,435
Not the curtains as well.

750
01:42:13,200 --> 01:42:15,760
You looked all right in this, you know.

751
01:42:16,920 --> 01:42:18,353
It's coming.

752
01:42:34,360 --> 01:42:36,430
- You definitely heard it?
- Yeah.

753
01:42:36,520 --> 01:42:39,717
- I can't hear anything.
- I told you, I heard it.

754
01:42:59,360 --> 01:43:01,112
Go.

755
01:43:32,920 --> 01:43:35,718
Do you think he saw us this time?

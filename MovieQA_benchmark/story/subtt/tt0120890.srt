1
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,367
Mr. Lombardo, what's up?

2
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:49,352
Did you see those eyes?

3
00:04:09,478 --> 00:04:11,544
Fuck off!

4
00:04:12,118 --> 00:04:14,884
I appreciate you guys coming down.

5
00:04:15,598 --> 00:04:17,498
All I'm going to miss is . . .

6
00:04:19,598 --> 00:04:22,665
Settle down.

7
00:04:23,438 --> 00:04:28,905
We've come to the halfway point
of our senior seminars.

8
00:04:33,796 --> 00:04:36,696
- Beats study hall, doesn't it?
- No!

9
00:04:37,436 --> 00:04:41,269
- That you, Jimmy?
- In study hall I can meditate.

10
00:04:42,195 --> 00:04:47,329
- He means masturbate.
- I'm sure you know all about that.

11
00:05:13,394 --> 00:05:16,094
It wasn't me, man !

12
00:05:18,074 --> 00:05:22,008
We've all heard the terms
"date rape", "sexual harassment".

13
00:05:23,513 --> 00:05:26,679
We've discussed
some of these issues here.

14
00:05:27,474 --> 00:05:31,007
Our guests today come from
the BlLue Bay Police Department.

15
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:38,607
Detectives Duquette and Perez
will give us a fresh perspective -

16
00:05:40,113 --> 00:05:45,780
- and address your questions.
Let's give them a warm welcome.

17
00:05:50,471 --> 00:05:53,971
I'm out of here.
This prick can kiss my ass.

18
00:06:03,472 --> 00:06:08,705
As I was saying . . . We'll start with
a question. What is a sex crime?

19
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:12,644
Not getting any.

20
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:22,004
Blue Bay, fight, fight!
Buccaneers, win tonight!

21
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:39,283
Steady.

22
00:06:43,469 --> 00:06:46,936
Steady the bow, Jimmy.

23
00:06:47,788 --> 00:06:50,188
That's good.

24
00:06:56,148 --> 00:07:01,048
Drop the main. All right, de-rig,
and I'll see you all Monday.

25
00:07:04,987 --> 00:07:08,587
The Buccaneers are number one,
and don't you forget it.

26
00:07:13,948 --> 00:07:17,881
- Good work, guys. See you Monday.
- See you, Mr. Lombardo.

27
00:07:29,746 --> 00:07:32,512
All right!
I could definitely party on that.

28
00:07:36,147 --> 00:07:40,880
That's a stinkpot, Jimmy.
A real boatman gets one of those.

29
00:07:43,985 --> 00:07:46,752
Now . . . that's a real boat.

30
00:07:49,225 --> 00:07:53,358
Thank you for getting me into this
class. My old man wouldn't pay.

31
00:07:54,345 --> 00:07:57,645
You're working for it.
And learning about boats.

32
00:07:58,464 --> 00:08:01,797
I put myself through college
working boats.

33
00:08:03,623 --> 00:08:07,190
Can I play too?
Or is it just for boys?

34
00:08:10,183 --> 00:08:15,849
So, who's washing your jeep this
weekend? The senior car wash !

35
00:08:17,144 --> 00:08:20,144
- That's a waste of time.
- Not at all.

36
00:08:20,903 --> 00:08:24,603
- How about if Nicole and I do it?
- Tell you what . . .

37
00:08:25,503 --> 00:08:29,970
I'm going to the Glades, Saturday.
On Sunday, you wash the mud off.

38
00:08:31,023 --> 00:08:32,757
Deal.

39
00:08:33,262 --> 00:08:37,029
My mom should give me a ride today,
but she's not here.

40
00:08:37,942 --> 00:08:41,175
So I was wondering
if you could give me one?

41
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:46,716
You wouldn't want me to walk?
Something bad might happen.

42
00:08:50,501 --> 00:08:53,467
- You need a lift, Jimbo?
- Yes, but I got my bike.

43
00:08:54,222 --> 00:08:56,555
Hey, no problem.

44
00:09:06,979 --> 00:09:09,946
Try it.

45
00:09:13,381 --> 00:09:16,315
Suzie, you need a lift?
We've got room.

46
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:21,327
Jesus! Where did she get the shoes?
"Whores-for-less?"

47
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:26,193
Try it again.

48
00:09:30,659 --> 00:09:32,993
Nice to see you kids getting along.

49
00:10:13,657 --> 00:10:16,323
- Don't forget Sunday.
- I won't.

50
00:10:19,537 --> 00:10:21,970
- Is that Sam Lombardo?
- Hi, Mom !

51
00:10:22,615 --> 00:10:26,215
- Sam ! Hi.
- Hi, Sandra.

52
00:10:28,696 --> 00:10:32,996
- Why don't you come in for a drink?
- Sorry, Sandra, I've got to run.

53
00:11:46,653 --> 00:11:48,619
- Hi, Mr. Lombardo.
- Hi, girls.

54
00:11:49,010 --> 00:11:52,010
- Hi, Mr. Lombardo.
- Hi, girls.

55
00:11:52,772 --> 00:11:56,672
- Look, he forgot. I knew it.
- No, I didn't. Check out my jeep.

56
00:11:57,610 --> 00:12:01,843
Nice and dirty.
But wait until the other car leaves.

57
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:06,150
You mean
the Mercedes isn't yours, too?

58
00:12:06,971 --> 00:12:09,671
My Benz is blue.
You know that, Nicole.

59
00:12:10,369 --> 00:12:14,869
- Sam, I'm leaving.
- Where's your hose, Mr. Lombardo?

60
00:12:15,929 --> 00:12:19,395
The hose, Kelly,
is in front of the jeep.

61
00:12:23,929 --> 00:12:26,896
Kelly Van Ryan's
going to wash your jeep?

62
00:12:27,648 --> 00:12:30,582
Come on, Barbara.
It's for a good cause.

63
00:12:32,328 --> 00:12:37,228
- Sam the Philanthropist!
- Hard work never hurt anyone.

64
00:12:41,728 --> 00:12:44,394
Have fun at the club.

65
00:13:44,764 --> 00:13:47,431
Looks brand new.

66
00:13:49,404 --> 00:13:51,770
Aren't you forgetting something?

67
00:13:52,405 --> 00:13:56,038
- Your coupon. We got to have it.
- Yeah, that thing.

68
00:13:56,923 --> 00:14:00,423
- Can't we just . . .
- Rules are rules, Mr. Lombardo.

69
00:14:01,284 --> 00:14:05,384
- Okay, let me look for it . . .
- Mr. Lombardo? We're kind of late.

70
00:14:06,364 --> 00:14:09,797
Nicole can go ahead. You can
give me a ride when you find it.

71
00:14:10,643 --> 00:14:14,109
Just give me a minute.

72
00:14:20,441 --> 00:14:24,008
- Go!
- Are you sure?

73
00:15:33,959 --> 00:15:37,092
Frankie! Oh God !

74
00:15:41,157 --> 00:15:43,924
Goddamn it!

75
00:15:44,957 --> 00:15:49,823
This is Blue Bay High School. Your
son or daughter was absent today.

76
00:15:52,917 --> 00:15:55,917
What?
Come on !

77
00:15:59,156 --> 00:16:01,956
- That's a hell of a fish, Art.
- It's a barracuda.

78
00:16:02,676 --> 00:16:07,543
If you weren't chasing booty at the
club you could have caught one, too.

79
00:16:08,717 --> 00:16:11,817
- You're not going to eat it?
- Why not?

80
00:16:12,636 --> 00:16:17,436
- They're poisonous. It'll kill you.
- Like most of the girls you date.

81
00:16:18,555 --> 00:16:20,255
Sandra Van Ryan, for Sam.

82
00:16:28,355 --> 00:16:30,422
- What's up?
- Kelly skipped school today.

83
00:16:30,994 --> 00:16:34,361
- Have you heard anything?
- Not a word.

84
00:16:36,034 --> 00:16:39,768
Never mind, I found her.

85
00:16:43,514 --> 00:16:45,247
Pull !

86
00:16:45,754 --> 00:16:48,554
Listen, Sam . . .
It was really good seeing you.

87
00:16:49,274 --> 00:16:52,240
Look Sandra,
I'm real busy right now, so . . .

88
00:16:52,994 --> 00:16:57,194
I haven't found anyone who can
handle my boat the way you can.

89
00:16:59,673 --> 00:17:04,073
- You're fucking Barbara. So what?
- Maybe I'm a one-woman man now.

90
00:17:05,113 --> 00:17:08,713
Poor Sam.

91
00:17:09,592 --> 00:17:12,259
You really think a Blue Bay woman
will marry you?

92
00:17:12,953 --> 00:17:15,620
- Are you finished?
- Grab a clue, Honey.

93
00:17:16,311 --> 00:17:20,744
You're a hired hand, a good lay,
that's all. Enjoy it while it lasts.

94
00:17:21,793 --> 00:17:23,393
Bye, Sandra.

95
00:17:25,312 --> 00:17:27,612
Pull !

96
00:17:29,431 --> 00:17:34,465
You seem to find guns therapeutic.
Maybe I ought to try it.

97
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:41,324
Let me guess. Some boy didn't call,
and screwed up your weekend?

98
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:44,597
So you're taking the day off.

99
00:17:48,551 --> 00:17:53,284
- Which of your deckhands is that?
- Whichever one I want.

100
00:17:55,789 --> 00:17:58,856
Okay, Kelly.
What's the matter?

101
00:18:02,231 --> 00:18:04,731
What is it?

102
00:18:05,389 --> 00:18:09,089
- I miss Dad.
- Jesus.

103
00:18:11,309 --> 00:18:15,076
- I miss him too. Sometimes.
- No, you don't.

104
00:18:15,988 --> 00:18:19,522
He didn't have to kill himself,
Kelly.

105
00:18:20,989 --> 00:18:23,689
Kelly . . .

106
00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:29,722
I . . .

107
00:18:30,388 --> 00:18:33,722
I don't know why he did it.

108
00:18:35,348 --> 00:18:38,148
I really don't.

109
00:18:42,307 --> 00:18:44,907
Can I . . .

110
00:18:46,786 --> 00:18:50,453
Can I get you anything?
Do you want a valium?

111
00:18:55,307 --> 00:18:59,840
- I was raped.
- What, Honey? I can't hear you.

112
00:19:00,907 --> 00:19:05,040
- I said I was raped.
- What?

113
00:19:07,746 --> 00:19:10,379
I was raped . . .

114
00:19:11,065 --> 00:19:14,132
. . . by Sam Lombardo.

115
00:19:15,185 --> 00:19:16,785
Sam Lombardo?

116
00:19:18,864 --> 00:19:23,664
- My daughter does not get raped !
- And you say Sam Lombardo did it?

117
00:19:24,785 --> 00:19:28,785
That son of a bitch must be insane
to think he can do this to me.

118
00:19:29,745 --> 00:19:34,112
We understand your feelings,
but we need some time with Kelly, -

119
00:19:35,145 --> 00:19:38,112
- to take her statement alone.

120
00:19:41,264 --> 00:19:44,464
- Are you all right with this, Baby?
- Yeah.

121
00:19:55,183 --> 00:19:58,183
Would you like to take a break
for a minute?

122
00:19:58,942 --> 00:20:01,542
I just want to get it over with.

123
00:20:02,223 --> 00:20:06,523
We'd like to video your statement.
These are serious charges.

124
00:20:07,542 --> 00:20:11,942
We must know everything
that happened. Are you ready?

125
00:20:23,061 --> 00:20:25,561
He started rubbing my shoulders.

126
00:20:28,622 --> 00:20:33,022
I let him.
I mean, he's a nice guy.

127
00:20:34,061 --> 00:20:36,061
The next thing...

128
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:40,220
... his hand was in my shorts.

129
00:20:41,101 --> 00:20:44,234
You know, from behind.

130
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:47,487
His fingers ...

131
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:53,860
- His fingers...
- Take your time.

132
00:20:56,139 --> 00:20:59,572
They were in me.
Both places, you know?

133
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:06,920
- Did he put himself inside you?
- Yes.

134
00:21:08,019 --> 00:21:12,652
I said "stop", I screamed. I mean,
that's how it sounded in my head.

135
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:18,233
- He hurt me.
- Did you try to fight him?

136
00:21:19,097 --> 00:21:24,631
- He pinned my wrists behind me.
- Then what?

137
00:21:25,898 --> 00:21:30,231
He kept saying,
"Let it happen, let it happen."

138
00:21:32,737 --> 00:21:36,637
- And then he just stopped.
- You mean, he withdrew?

139
00:21:37,576 --> 00:21:42,043
- It's really hard to remember.
- Try, Kelly.

140
00:21:47,976 --> 00:21:50,576
I know one thing he said.
He said:

141
00:21:51,255 --> 00:21:54,322
"Don't worry, I didn't come."

142
00:21:55,096 --> 00:21:57,996
I can't forget that.

143
00:21:58,736 --> 00:22:02,569
He said, "No little girl can ever
make me come."

144
00:22:06,254 --> 00:22:09,288
"No little girl can ever
make me come." Jesus!

145
00:22:10,054 --> 00:22:14,054
Too bad, we might have had
some physical evidence.

146
00:22:16,295 --> 00:22:20,662
Maybe there's no physical evidence
because nothing happened.

147
00:22:21,694 --> 00:22:24,327
I think she's acting.

148
00:22:25,016 --> 00:22:29,382
She set it up to be alone with him,
so he could come on. But he didn't.

149
00:22:30,415 --> 00:22:34,515
Maybe, maybe not. He should
never have had her out there.

150
00:22:35,493 --> 00:22:38,026
Gloria, he's done half
the women in Blue Bay.

151
00:22:38,695 --> 00:22:42,528
That doesn't make him a rapist.
She could take a polygraph.

152
00:22:43,453 --> 00:22:46,353
And the Pope could take a piss test.
This is Blue Bay.

153
00:22:47,093 --> 00:22:50,959
Ask a Van Ryan for that
and Tom Baxter will cut you off.

154
00:22:51,893 --> 00:22:55,493
You're afraid of Tom Baxter now?
Or Sandra Van Ryan?

155
00:22:56,372 --> 00:23:00,472
Talk to his neighbours,
his co-workers and Kelly's friends.

156
00:23:01,452 --> 00:23:06,419
- This will destroy Lombardo.
- You heard her. The guy's dirty.

157
00:23:07,571 --> 00:23:10,071
Bring me a case.

158
00:23:59,810 --> 00:24:03,543
Good work, Jimbo.
I'll see you Monday.

159
00:24:11,049 --> 00:24:14,249
That's what's left
of my sailing class.

160
00:24:16,888 --> 00:24:22,255
- Talk to me, Artie.
- Kelly is accusing you of rape.

161
00:24:23,488 --> 00:24:27,521
Jimmy told me.
Apparently I'm the last one to know.

162
00:24:28,487 --> 00:24:34,520
Sandra Van Ryan has been ringing
every member of the school board.

163
00:24:35,886 --> 00:24:40,320
- She's pushing for suspension.
- And they won't hear my side?

164
00:24:41,366 --> 00:24:44,266
This is insane.
I'm innocent, goddammit!

165
00:24:45,006 --> 00:24:48,040
- You've got to believe that.
- Just hang in there.

166
00:24:48,807 --> 00:24:52,640
- When they clear you . . .
- You never get clear of this.

167
00:24:54,926 --> 00:24:59,059
It stays with you.
It follows you around forever.

168
00:25:01,045 --> 00:25:05,012
You're going to need some help, Sam.
An attorney.

169
00:25:05,965 --> 00:25:11,032
And what attorney in South Florida
will go up against the Van Ryans?

170
00:25:28,404 --> 00:25:31,404
Hi. I'm here to see Ken Bowden.

171
00:25:32,164 --> 00:25:37,231
- Do you have an appointment?
- Yeah, Sam Lombardo.

172
00:25:38,403 --> 00:25:41,937
- Mr. Bowden, your 10:30's here.
- Show him in, please.

173
00:25:45,443 --> 00:25:47,143
What brings you here?

174
00:25:47,643 --> 00:25:53,277
Until yesterday, I was a guidance
counsellor at Blue Bay High School.

175
00:25:55,203 --> 00:25:59,270
- A student is accusing me of rape.
- Male or female?

176
00:26:01,522 --> 00:26:05,822
The student is Kelly Van Ryan.
Which means, I'm fucked.

177
00:26:09,161 --> 00:26:13,261
- Why don't you tell me about it?
- Shit, where do I begin?

178
00:26:14,241 --> 00:26:18,008
Your relationship with the girl.

179
00:26:19,841 --> 00:26:23,341
She's a student, I was her
guidance counsellor, that's all.

180
00:26:25,122 --> 00:26:28,222
Then you've got nothing
to worry about.

181
00:26:30,239 --> 00:26:35,239
- What happened to your neck?
- This? I don't have to wear it.

182
00:26:39,041 --> 00:26:42,907
There was an insurance guy
around earlier.

183
00:26:43,839 --> 00:26:46,139
Let me tell you how I charge.

184
00:26:54,079 --> 00:26:56,079
Georgie!
How's the wind today?

185
00:26:56,638 --> 00:26:59,672
Mr. Lombardo, I'm afraid
I can't park for you today.

186
00:27:00,439 --> 00:27:02,306
I'm meeting Barbara for lunch.

187
00:27:07,918 --> 00:27:12,352
- Can you park this, Georgie?
- Right away, Mr. Baxter.

188
00:27:13,999 --> 00:27:17,666
You're finished here, Lombardo.
Take a hike.

189
00:27:22,638 --> 00:27:25,838
Barbara, what's going on?

190
00:27:29,317 --> 00:27:34,350
Maybe you didn't hear me, Lombardo.
You're finished in Blue Bay.

191
00:27:35,517 --> 00:27:39,851
If you see my daughter again,
you'll be finished, period.

192
00:27:40,876 --> 00:27:44,809
- Get the fuck out of here.
- Mr. Lombardo, please . . .

193
00:27:49,435 --> 00:27:52,102
It's all right, George.

194
00:28:13,475 --> 00:28:16,375
Sam, Honey!
Haven't seen you in a while.

195
00:28:17,114 --> 00:28:20,347
- Welcome back.
- Rum and coke.

196
00:29:47,029 --> 00:29:50,929
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

197
00:29:51,869 --> 00:29:54,135
That's too bad, motherfucker.

198
00:30:06,588 --> 00:30:08,988
Sam?

199
00:30:13,349 --> 00:30:15,782
Lombardo?

200
00:30:35,547 --> 00:30:38,480
Whoa, man !
It's me.

201
00:30:39,226 --> 00:30:42,226
Sorry, man.
Things have been a bit weird here.

202
00:30:42,986 --> 00:30:45,452
I can see that.

203
00:30:46,106 --> 00:30:48,206
Come on in.

204
00:30:50,786 --> 00:30:54,619
You're sure this Frankie Condo
is the guy that did it?

205
00:30:55,545 --> 00:30:58,879
It was him. He was driving
Sandra's Range Rover.

206
00:30:59,705 --> 00:31:02,472
Tell the cops, and we can go
after Sandra Van Ryan.

207
00:31:03,185 --> 00:31:06,518
- Forget it.
- The lady has deep pockets.

208
00:31:07,346 --> 00:31:12,812
I know how deep her pockets are.
I thought I might save my house . . .

209
00:31:14,065 --> 00:31:17,298
But guess who's on the
board of directors at the bank?

210
00:31:18,104 --> 00:31:22,838
I don't need more trouble from her.
Do you think I can stop her?

211
00:31:23,943 --> 00:31:27,076
With the shit I got on Kelly?
Yeah.

212
00:31:27,862 --> 00:31:33,528
A year ago, when her old man shot
himself, Kelly lost it, ran away.

213
00:31:34,822 --> 00:31:37,955
They found her in a fleabag motel.
Coked out of her gourd.

214
00:31:39,543 --> 00:31:44,843
Meanwhile you, Sam, are voted
"Educator of the Year" or some crap.

215
00:31:46,061 --> 00:31:51,095
If they put the two of you in front
of a jury, they'll look stupid.

216
00:31:52,262 --> 00:31:56,462
They haven't taken your statement,
because they're looking for dirt.

217
00:31:57,461 --> 00:32:00,195
And they're not going to find it.

218
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:05,073
Right?

219
00:32:05,741 --> 00:32:09,241
Ken, I don't fuck my students.

220
00:32:42,979 --> 00:32:45,945
He's just showing off for you now.

221
00:32:47,499 --> 00:32:51,533
Good evening, Ruby.
I see you've still got Walter.

222
00:32:52,498 --> 00:32:56,065
I was hoping
something had eaten him by now.

223
00:32:56,938 --> 00:33:01,471
- Can I help you with something?
- Suzie called us. Where is she?

224
00:33:02,538 --> 00:33:04,471
You know the way.

225
00:33:11,058 --> 00:33:14,258
You won't shoot her, will you?

226
00:33:16,018 --> 00:33:19,085
I don't believe she's armed.

227
00:33:59,214 --> 00:34:02,714
It took you long enough !
What if I was being strangled?

228
00:34:03,575 --> 00:34:06,342
Or fucked in the ass, even?

229
00:34:07,654 --> 00:34:12,354
- I mean, you do sex crimes, right?
- My partner, Detective Perez.

230
00:34:18,414 --> 00:34:22,514
Céline. He had a good line
on what cheap fucks people are.

231
00:34:23,493 --> 00:34:26,327
Suzie, you called us, remember?

232
00:34:32,972 --> 00:34:37,506
- Did they arrest Mr. Lombardo?
- No.

233
00:34:39,652 --> 00:34:42,419
- Will they?
- I don't know.

234
00:34:43,132 --> 00:34:45,899
That bothers you?

235
00:34:47,172 --> 00:34:48,972
I want to go outside.

236
00:34:56,212 --> 00:35:00,645
- When did he give you this ride?
- About a year ago.

237
00:35:01,691 --> 00:35:05,324
- Was anyone else at your trailer?
- Nope.

238
00:35:06,211 --> 00:35:08,778
- So you were alone?
- Yeah.

239
00:35:09,450 --> 00:35:12,084
- Did he come in with you?
- I guess.

240
00:35:12,771 --> 00:35:17,571
- Did he or didn't he?
- Okay. Yeah, he did.

241
00:35:18,690 --> 00:35:22,757
Then what? Did he touch you?
Did you flirt with him?

242
00:35:23,729 --> 00:35:27,263
Suzie, I know you feel bad.
Just tell us the truth.

243
00:35:28,130 --> 00:35:30,330
I didn't say a thing to him.

244
00:35:31,849 --> 00:35:35,549
He put his arm around me
and told me I was pretty.

245
00:35:36,448 --> 00:35:40,082
- I could be really pretty, he said.
- Did you ask him to stop?

246
00:35:40,969 --> 00:35:45,502
Shit! What difference does it make?
No one will believe me anyway.

247
00:35:46,569 --> 00:35:51,135
- Did Sam Lombardo rape you?
- He did. He pushed me to the floor.

248
00:35:54,248 --> 00:35:58,714
- Now, are we done?
- Almost, Suzie, almost.

249
00:35:59,887 --> 00:36:01,887
Could you fight him off?

250
00:36:03,487 --> 00:36:06,587
No. He stopped by himself.

251
00:36:07,367 --> 00:36:10,167
Is that it?
Leave me alone.

252
00:36:10,887 --> 00:36:13,887
- Don't touch me!
- All right, take it easy.

253
00:36:14,648 --> 00:36:18,981
He stopped. And that was it?
He just left?

254
00:36:20,006 --> 00:36:25,806
- Yeah. He did say one thing first.
- What was that?

255
00:36:27,846 --> 00:36:31,779
He said, "No little bitch
can ever make me come."

256
00:36:34,605 --> 00:36:37,172
Open the gate.

257
00:36:39,525 --> 00:36:41,292
Look at this girlfriend.

258
00:36:41,804 --> 00:36:45,337
- Counsellor, how about a smoke?
- Hello, Jinxy.

259
00:36:48,005 --> 00:36:51,238
It's a bad news/good news situation.

260
00:36:52,044 --> 00:36:57,111
No bail, but you get a real attorney
instead of a public defender.

261
00:36:58,804 --> 00:37:01,404
I'm telling you, Ken.
I'm innocent.

262
00:37:02,084 --> 00:37:06,251
You are preaching to the choir.
You're not alone.

263
00:37:12,363 --> 00:37:15,263
So you're the new chicken-licker?

264
00:37:23,602 --> 00:37:26,769
- Any comment on the case?
- What are your feelings?

265
00:37:27,561 --> 00:37:30,495
Mr. Lombardo
will get what he deserves.

266
00:37:32,402 --> 00:37:34,368
- Feeling confident?
- Yes.

267
00:37:34,923 --> 00:37:38,789
The Lombardo case
has galvanised this upscale town.

268
00:37:39,722 --> 00:37:44,022
Here's Sandra Van Ryan, millionaire
heiress from the Blue Bay elite.

269
00:37:45,041 --> 00:37:47,408
And the girl from skid row.

270
00:37:48,042 --> 00:37:52,575
The jury must choose between these
girls' stories, and Sam Lombardo's.

271
00:37:53,641 --> 00:37:57,141
Live at the courthouse,
Nancy Duerr, Eyewitness News.

272
00:38:36,239 --> 00:38:40,339
State of Florida vs. Sam Lombardo.
Sylvia B. Waxman presiding.

273
00:38:41,318 --> 00:38:44,351
All rise.

274
00:38:48,077 --> 00:38:50,777
Please be seated.

275
00:39:04,516 --> 00:39:07,716
Would you like more time, Kelly?

276
00:39:11,677 --> 00:39:16,577
I know this is hard, Kelly,
but I have one more question.

277
00:39:17,716 --> 00:39:23,650
And even though we've been over it,
I want us all to be clear about it.

278
00:39:24,996 --> 00:39:30,329
Kelly, when you saw Mr. Lombardo
intended to have sex with you . . .

279
00:39:31,555 --> 00:39:36,188
. . . what were your exact words?
What did you say?

280
00:39:37,636 --> 00:39:40,470
I told him, "No."

281
00:39:41,194 --> 00:39:44,761
I said,
"Stop, Mr. Lombardo, please."

282
00:39:45,635 --> 00:39:48,535
I screamed for him to stop.

283
00:39:49,274 --> 00:39:51,574
You screamed, for him . . .

284
00:39:52,194 --> 00:39:55,260
. . . to stop.
And did he?

285
00:39:57,874 --> 00:40:00,074
No.

286
00:40:00,673 --> 00:40:05,040
He raped me
on the floor of his shitty house.

287
00:40:11,433 --> 00:40:13,733
Thank you.

288
00:40:19,032 --> 00:40:24,266
On day two, the second alleged
young victim has taken the stand.

289
00:40:25,472 --> 00:40:28,805
Yesterday, Kelly Van Ryan
gave an emotional account -

290
00:40:29,632 --> 00:40:32,565
- and was not swayed
by cross-examination.

291
00:40:33,310 --> 00:40:35,977
We'll be back later with an update.

292
00:40:58,791 --> 00:41:01,391
Good morning.

293
00:41:02,070 --> 00:41:09,570
Miss, when you were picked up
for shoplifting in freshman year -

294
00:41:11,229 --> 00:41:16,096
- you were allowed to make one call.
You called Mr. Lombardo, correct?

295
00:41:18,509 --> 00:41:21,142
Miss Toller?

296
00:41:21,830 --> 00:41:25,063
And when you were expelled
for vandalism . . .

297
00:41:25,868 --> 00:41:29,168
I broke a fucking window.
It wasn't my fault.

298
00:41:29,989 --> 00:41:36,089
Wait until you are asked, and
don't use profanity in this court.

299
00:41:40,428 --> 00:41:44,894
It was Mr. Lombardo who went with
you, in lieu of a parent conference?

300
00:41:45,949 --> 00:41:48,215
Yes.

301
00:41:48,827 --> 00:41:52,860
It seems to me
that Mr. Lombardo was your friend.

302
00:41:53,827 --> 00:41:56,294
He was.

303
00:41:56,947 --> 00:42:00,081
But all that changed, when, -

304
00:42:00,866 --> 00:42:07,099
- according to your testimony,
Mr. Lombardo raped you -

305
00:42:08,507 --> 00:42:13,440
- on April 23rd of last year.
Is that right?

306
00:42:14,585 --> 00:42:18,719
But in May, when you were
arrested for possessing narcotics, -

307
00:42:19,706 --> 00:42:24,239
- and again allowed a phone call,
you called Mr. Lombardo.

308
00:42:30,225 --> 00:42:33,758
- So what?
- "So what?"

309
00:42:36,145 --> 00:42:39,078
"So what?"

310
00:42:40,184 --> 00:42:42,717
Oops, Suzie.

311
00:42:43,384 --> 00:42:48,551
One month after you say this man
raped you, you go to him for help?

312
00:42:49,743 --> 00:42:52,577
It sounds like
you still considered him a friend.

313
00:42:53,343 --> 00:42:58,810
- I needed help.
- I'm sure you did. But he was gone.

314
00:43:00,063 --> 00:43:04,063
And you spent six months
in a correctional facility.

315
00:43:05,024 --> 00:43:09,757
Did that make you mad, Suzie? That
Sam was gone? That he wasn't there?

316
00:43:12,181 --> 00:43:17,448
- Is that why you're saying this?
- I said it, because it happened.

317
00:43:18,661 --> 00:43:22,495
Are you going to sit there and swear
Sam Lombardo raped you?

318
00:43:23,422 --> 00:43:27,555
- I said he did.
- Let me ask you a question.

319
00:43:28,541 --> 00:43:31,241
Did you enjoy
being a guest of the state?

320
00:43:31,942 --> 00:43:36,042
I promise you that if you're lying,
as I believe you are, -

321
00:43:37,020 --> 00:43:38,887
- you'll visit that facility again.

322
00:43:39,421 --> 00:43:43,621
Which is why I'll ask you again,
under oath:

323
00:43:44,621 --> 00:43:48,454
Suzie,
did Samuel Lombardo rape you?

324
00:43:53,860 --> 00:43:56,493
Miss Toller,
you must answer the question.

325
00:44:00,940 --> 00:44:04,706
- Miss Toller . . .
- Goddamn it!

326
00:44:05,621 --> 00:44:10,321
- This was not my idea.
- Objection ! Defence is badgering.

327
00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:14,253
The court will hear
what Miss Toller has to say.

328
00:44:14,979 --> 00:44:17,412
Miss Toller?

329
00:44:19,578 --> 00:44:24,878
Sam Lombardo didn't rape me.
He didn't rape Kelly, either.

330
00:44:26,098 --> 00:44:29,198
This is ridiculous!
The witness has been threatened . . .

331
00:44:29,978 --> 00:44:34,211
This court intends to hear
Miss Toller's story.

332
00:44:35,218 --> 00:44:36,852
Miss Toller?

333
00:44:37,338 --> 00:44:40,138
I just wanted to hurt Mr. Lombardo.

334
00:44:40,856 --> 00:44:43,923
I mean, he was my friend, at first.

335
00:44:44,696 --> 00:44:49,030
When I got busted he didn't help me.
I went to that hell-hole.

336
00:44:50,058 --> 00:44:53,858
- First favourite, then who cares?
- Make her stop.

337
00:44:54,777 --> 00:44:57,977
When Kelly said we should do this,
I thought, "Cool."

338
00:44:58,777 --> 00:45:02,577
Big shots who screwed me over,
like Duquette, will get screwed.

339
00:45:03,496 --> 00:45:08,496
- I'm sorry, I have to object.
- Your honour, may I be heard?

340
00:45:09,655 --> 00:45:12,555
Mr. Baxter,
you are not trying this case.

341
00:45:13,296 --> 00:45:16,096
Go sit down.

342
00:45:19,896 --> 00:45:24,062
Kelly is pissed at Mr. Lombardo,
too. She's in love with him.

343
00:45:25,056 --> 00:45:30,889
He was her fantasy, but then she
found out he was doing her mom.

344
00:45:32,214 --> 00:45:35,148
Fuck!
You skanky bitch !

345
00:45:35,894 --> 00:45:39,761
Get your fucking hands off me.
I'll have you fired !

346
00:45:46,133 --> 00:45:49,000
Just get the hell away from me.

347
00:45:50,853 --> 00:45:56,019
- Jesus, man, cut loose!
- I'm just wondering where to stay.

348
00:45:57,214 --> 00:46:00,780
I've lost my house.
I'm waking up from a nightmare.

349
00:46:01,653 --> 00:46:06,386
Get over it. We've got an airtight
lawsuit against Sandra Van Ryan.

350
00:46:08,733 --> 00:46:13,366
- Just like that?
- These people ruined your life.

351
00:46:14,452 --> 00:46:18,386
I told you they would go too far.
They went overboard !

352
00:46:19,332 --> 00:46:22,632
They'll settle. Believe me,
they'll be begging to settle.

353
00:46:23,891 --> 00:46:26,558
Here we go.
Wait up! Come on, girl.

354
00:46:27,252 --> 00:46:32,819
Sam Lombardo was dismissed when
a victim reversed her testimony.

355
00:46:34,092 --> 00:46:37,325
Excuse me, over here!
Can anybody read?

356
00:46:42,210 --> 00:46:45,376
Nail that shyster's balls
to the nearest wall.

357
00:46:46,170 --> 00:46:50,403
That was possible, until Miss Not
So Bright started throwing things.

358
00:46:51,410 --> 00:46:55,177
Are you just going to let them
get away with this . . . shit?

359
00:46:56,089 --> 00:46:58,489
On the word
of a white trash bitch.

360
00:46:59,130 --> 00:47:02,830
I don't think you get it, Sandy.
Your princess committed perjury.

361
00:47:03,729 --> 00:47:09,496
- I'll try to keep her out of jail.
- What are we going to do?

362
00:47:17,567 --> 00:47:20,701
- Here's your coffee, Sam.
- Thank you.

363
00:47:33,368 --> 00:47:36,135
Ken . . .

364
00:47:46,607 --> 00:47:48,541
Sorry I'm late.

365
00:47:49,086 --> 00:47:53,586
- Hold my calls, Lenore.
- Okay, Mr. Bowden.

366
00:48:14,205 --> 00:48:16,539
Thank you, Sandra.

367
00:48:19,684 --> 00:48:23,851
I'll be seeing you.
Okay?

368
00:48:31,284 --> 00:48:34,717
Nice to see you, Tom.
Come by, we'll have lunch.

369
00:48:38,764 --> 00:48:41,164
See you at the club.

370
00:48:43,164 --> 00:48:45,330
See you at the club.

371
00:48:45,923 --> 00:48:48,923
See you at the club . . .

372
00:48:52,242 --> 00:48:55,776
Tom, what did you shoot today?
Hey, my man.

373
00:48:59,282 --> 00:49:01,782
This is for you.

374
00:49:02,442 --> 00:49:06,042
You did good, Ken.
Thanks.

375
00:49:06,922 --> 00:49:10,355
I know you wish it never happened.
But it did.

376
00:49:11,201 --> 00:49:15,835
Take the money and enjoy yourself.
Find a happy place.

377
00:49:16,922 --> 00:49:19,089
Lenore, see Mr. Lombardo out.

378
00:49:19,682 --> 00:49:23,449
- Goodbye, Sam.
- Goodbye, Lenore.

379
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:42,846
Take care of my lizards.

380
00:49:49,999 --> 00:49:52,799
- Hello, Kelly.
- Drop dead !

381
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:56,620
Know how my mom's paying you?
She's breaking my trust.

382
00:49:57,398 --> 00:50:01,365
I can't touch it until she's dead,
and she's breaking it.

383
00:50:02,318 --> 00:50:05,485
- I'm sorry.
- Why don't you spend it with her?

384
00:50:06,279 --> 00:50:10,246
I hate you !
I hate you, you son of a bitch.

385
00:50:22,997 --> 00:50:27,063
You see? I couldn't come back,
even if I wanted to.

386
00:51:03,116 --> 00:51:05,849
Goddamn maid.

387
00:51:39,234 --> 00:51:43,201
So you got my mom's money.
How much?

388
00:51:44,913 --> 00:51:48,947
- How much?
- You know how much.

389
00:51:49,912 --> 00:51:52,545
Your turn to pay.

390
00:51:53,992 --> 00:51:57,725
It worked !
We screwed the bitch.

391
00:51:58,633 --> 00:52:01,466
It worked just like you said.

392
00:52:02,192 --> 00:52:07,226
- What's wrong?
- What's wrong, is you coming here.

393
00:52:08,391 --> 00:52:10,791
Are you fucking crazy?

394
00:52:11,431 --> 00:52:15,065
Yeah, I'm crazy.
Ask my mom.

395
00:52:18,351 --> 00:52:22,118
So, how much is 8.5 million
divided by three?

396
00:52:23,031 --> 00:52:26,164
Great, big joke.

397
00:52:26,951 --> 00:52:32,184
You think this is fucking over?
It's a long way from over.

398
00:52:34,310 --> 00:52:37,243
I'm serious.

399
00:52:38,789 --> 00:52:43,589
After tonight, the three of us are
not to be seen together again.

400
00:52:45,109 --> 00:52:47,176
After tonight?

401
00:52:47,750 --> 00:52:52,317
Well . . . we're here, aren't we?

402
00:52:54,310 --> 00:52:57,210
Maybe one celebration is okay.

403
00:52:57,949 --> 00:53:01,516
If we're in agreement
that from here on out . . .

404
00:53:04,309 --> 00:53:07,476
. . . you do exactly as I say.

405
00:53:47,746 --> 00:53:52,013
Guidance counsellors get to find out
lots of interesting things.

406
00:54:03,144 --> 00:54:06,478
Now, I want you two to kiss.

407
00:54:07,305 --> 00:54:11,572
Come on. Never let the sun
go down on an argument.

408
00:55:26,300 --> 00:55:29,600
I told you they would
make us look stupid.

409
00:55:30,421 --> 00:55:33,454
You're right.
They did make us look stupid.

410
00:55:34,220 --> 00:55:37,620
What you're wrong about, is why.
Hear me out.

411
00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:40,993
Lombardo was seeing
Sandra Van Ryan.

412
00:55:41,659 --> 00:55:45,526
Why not tell us?
It gave Kelly a hell of a motive.

413
00:55:46,459 --> 00:55:48,893
Maybe they were saving it
for the trial.

414
00:55:49,539 --> 00:55:54,039
You're Lombardo, you don't want
to sit in jail for three months . . .

415
00:55:55,097 --> 00:55:58,064
- Unless . . .
- Unless what?

416
00:55:59,579 --> 00:56:02,179
Unless you're setting
Sandra Van Ryan up.

417
00:56:02,857 --> 00:56:05,490
Lombardo was eyeball-deep in debt.

418
00:56:06,179 --> 00:56:09,279
A rich girl like Barbara Baxter
is expensive.

419
00:56:10,059 --> 00:56:15,392
- But why would Kelly have to steal?
- Her money's in trust.

420
00:56:16,577 --> 00:56:20,144
This guy wanted to marry money.

421
00:56:21,016 --> 00:56:26,216
When that didn't work, he used
the girls to set up Sandra Van Ryan.

422
00:56:27,418 --> 00:56:29,318
They chumped us.

423
00:56:29,857 --> 00:56:33,257
They chumped us,
right from the start.

424
00:57:24,733 --> 00:57:29,133
- Nice stroke.
- Why are you here?

425
00:57:30,174 --> 00:57:34,640
- Curiosity, I guess.
- About how to improve your stroke?

426
00:57:36,533 --> 00:57:39,799
About how it'll work out
for you and Sam and Suzie.

427
00:57:42,173 --> 00:57:46,373
- Excuse me?
- Will you go down to the Caribbean?

428
00:57:47,372 --> 00:57:51,105
- Threesomes rarely work out.
- You're out of your mind.

429
00:57:52,012 --> 00:57:54,912
It's hard for three people
to keep a secret.

430
00:57:55,651 --> 00:57:58,184
Especially when two of them
are in love.

431
00:57:58,852 --> 00:58:03,152
You and Sam don't really want that
little pill-head around, do you?

432
00:58:04,171 --> 00:58:08,771
Did Sam sell you
on the idea of whacking Suzie?

433
00:58:09,850 --> 00:58:14,384
- That's murder, kid.
- Police, God ! Get a life.

434
00:58:17,011 --> 00:58:19,878
You're good, you know that?

435
00:58:20,609 --> 00:58:24,442
But don't think that little freak
Suzie's going to hold up.

436
00:58:44,848 --> 00:58:47,381
Hello, Suzie.

437
00:58:48,049 --> 00:58:51,449
Watch it with that shit,
or you'll get busted again.

438
00:58:52,288 --> 00:58:55,455
Yeah, or wind up dead.

439
00:59:01,368 --> 00:59:07,234
You know, I don't think I told you
how sorry I was about your friend.

440
00:59:08,567 --> 00:59:10,833
What was his name?

441
00:59:13,247 --> 00:59:16,047
Come on, help me out.
You know his name.

442
00:59:19,167 --> 00:59:24,734
- Davy.
- I was really sorry about that.

443
00:59:26,006 --> 00:59:28,373
- That is cop bullshit.
- What was that?

444
00:59:29,006 --> 00:59:33,106
I don't have to listen to this.
I have friends now . . .

445
00:59:34,086 --> 00:59:39,286
This is Ray, Suzie. You don't
have shit, you never will have shit.

446
00:59:44,405 --> 00:59:48,705
Take a look at this.
Go ahead, it won't bite you.

447
00:59:49,726 --> 00:59:52,359
Take it.

448
00:59:54,485 --> 00:59:57,685
Your friend Sam
deposited the cheque.

449
00:59:58,484 --> 01:00:01,884
He put the funds
into an offshore numbered account.

450
01:00:02,724 --> 01:00:06,124
Cops don't know whose name's on it.
Think it's yours?

451
01:00:06,963 --> 01:00:11,430
He also put a down payment on
an island property and a sailboat.

452
01:00:12,484 --> 01:00:17,618
- Why are you telling me this stuff?
- Because I know what's going on.

453
01:00:18,802 --> 01:00:22,002
Two's company, three's a crowd.

454
01:00:22,802 --> 01:00:27,369
You don't really think Kelly and Sam
will share the money with you?

455
01:00:30,203 --> 01:00:32,703
Leave me alone.

456
01:00:40,602 --> 01:00:44,035
You know, I'd want a clear head now,
if I were you, -

457
01:00:44,881 --> 01:00:48,715
- so I could keep a real close eye
on my new friends.

458
01:00:50,442 --> 01:00:53,475
I'd hate to see you
come to a bad end . . .

459
01:00:54,242 --> 01:00:57,109
. . . like Davy.

460
01:01:08,360 --> 01:01:11,060
Shit!

461
01:01:15,240 --> 01:01:18,207
This is Sam Lombardo.
Leave a brief message.

462
01:01:33,400 --> 01:01:36,166
You called Sam?
What's the matter with you?

463
01:01:36,879 --> 01:01:41,579
- There's no one to trust.
- You can trust me.

464
01:01:49,918 --> 01:01:53,552
Is Suzie there?
Christ, I was afraid of that.

465
01:01:54,437 --> 01:02:00,137
She left this insane message on my
machine. She's going to blow it.

466
01:02:02,478 --> 01:02:06,978
- Calm the bitch down.
- Why can't you come?

467
01:02:08,037 --> 01:02:10,704
Sam, I miss you so much.

468
01:02:13,676 --> 01:02:18,543
I miss you too. But I can't, right
now. We've got to stick to the plan.

469
01:02:20,476 --> 01:02:23,376
- If she can't get a grip ...
- Then what?

470
01:02:24,116 --> 01:02:27,150
You know what. I'll handle it.

471
01:02:27,916 --> 01:02:32,616
But I need you
to be there for me tonight.

472
01:02:33,714 --> 01:02:36,714
Good. That's my girl.
You're the strong one.

473
01:02:37,476 --> 01:02:41,109
Get Suzie.
I want you both to hear this.

474
01:02:46,955 --> 01:02:50,655
Look, we've got to stay calm.
All of us.

475
01:02:51,594 --> 01:02:56,994
Since the settlement, people think
I'm rich, so I act like a rich guy.

476
01:02:58,275 --> 01:03:01,442
Don't let this cop
try and fuck with you.

477
01:03:02,234 --> 01:03:05,501
- That's easy for you to say . . .
- Suzie, don't fall apart.

478
01:03:06,314 --> 01:03:09,547
The only people
who can fuck this up, is us.

479
01:03:16,273 --> 01:03:19,073
You are going to fuck me over,
aren't you?

480
01:03:19,792 --> 01:03:22,326
- For Christ's sake . . .
- You are!

481
01:03:22,992 --> 01:03:26,859
Are you retarded or
just brain-dead from swamp fumes?

482
01:03:27,792 --> 01:03:32,092
That's what I am to you, isn't it?
Swamp trash, just like my mom.

483
01:03:33,552 --> 01:03:36,085
Don't!

484
01:03:38,471 --> 01:03:41,304
You stupid cunt.

485
01:04:11,629 --> 01:04:14,796
You are scared, aren't you?

486
01:04:49,307 --> 01:04:52,107
Jesus Christ!

487
01:04:52,828 --> 01:04:55,961
- Are you crazy?
- "Sam". That was Lombardo.

488
01:04:56,747 --> 01:04:59,981
- You saw the girls . . .
- The tape is unintelligible.

489
01:05:00,788 --> 01:05:04,688
This shows you on the Van Ryan
property, shooting a porn flick!

490
01:05:05,628 --> 01:05:09,595
They threw things at each other
in court. They were acting !

491
01:05:10,547 --> 01:05:15,681
They were all acting ! They're taking
$8 million from Sandra Van Ryan.

492
01:05:16,866 --> 01:05:19,466
She tried to destroy the man's life.

493
01:05:20,146 --> 01:05:24,280
She thought he'd raped her daughter.
She bought the same story.

494
01:05:25,266 --> 01:05:28,333
Listen, both of you.
There is no fucking case.

495
01:05:29,105 --> 01:05:35,205
Sandra Van Ryan will be suing us
for invasion of privacy, so drop it.

496
01:05:36,585 --> 01:05:41,252
- Am I getting through on this?
- You think it's just about money?

497
01:05:42,344 --> 01:05:47,011
About us looking stupid? Question
him. He's a stone-cold psychopath.

498
01:05:48,104 --> 01:05:52,138
- The girls will wind up dead.
- Give this idiot the Kennedy case.

499
01:05:53,104 --> 01:05:57,671
- I understand . . .
- Next time, I'm going to sue you.

500
01:05:58,744 --> 01:06:02,544
You're lucky I didn't sue you
last time. Am I free to go?

501
01:06:03,463 --> 01:06:06,430
- Yes.
- Thank you.

502
01:06:07,583 --> 01:06:09,916
- Cocksucker!
- What was that?

503
01:06:10,542 --> 01:06:15,109
- You heard me, motherfucker.
- You want to say that to my face?

504
01:06:17,423 --> 01:06:20,556
What are you looking at?

505
01:07:01,222 --> 01:07:05,488
- I guess I kind of lost it.
- You could say that.

506
01:07:08,781 --> 01:07:13,447
Have you ever seen something
coming, and done nothing to stop it?

507
01:07:14,540 --> 01:07:19,440
- We all have.
- Something bad. It happened . . .

508
01:07:20,579 --> 01:07:23,079
. . . and you didn't do anything.

509
01:07:27,498 --> 01:07:32,264
I did that once.
I don't want to do it again.

510
01:07:51,257 --> 01:07:54,890
I thought we were going to a movie.

511
01:07:55,776 --> 01:07:59,910
I think we just need to get wasted.

512
01:08:17,936 --> 01:08:19,769
Come on.

513
01:08:25,935 --> 01:08:28,635
I want to live at the beach
some day.

514
01:08:29,335 --> 01:08:34,435
Shit! I left the keys.
I'll get them.

515
01:08:54,014 --> 01:08:57,880
- Kelly?
- Suzie . . .

516
01:08:59,534 --> 01:09:02,534
It's me.

517
01:09:05,693 --> 01:09:11,993
I was worried about you. I thought
we'd get together one last time.

518
01:09:13,412 --> 01:09:15,946
- Are you mad at me?
- No, no.

519
01:09:16,612 --> 01:09:20,612
I should have said more
about the part you should play.

520
01:09:21,572 --> 01:09:24,106
We'll go through it all
again tonight.

521
01:09:27,132 --> 01:09:30,232
This is a celebration,
not a suicide pact.

522
01:09:31,050 --> 01:09:34,350
We're going to chill out,
just relax.

523
01:09:35,172 --> 01:09:38,572
Have a little champagne,
watch the stars.

524
01:09:40,410 --> 01:09:44,444
Kelly, have you got a blanket
in the back of your mom's Rover?

525
01:09:45,410 --> 01:09:49,143
Why don't you be an angel
and run over and get it?

526
01:09:50,811 --> 01:09:53,444
Good girl.

527
01:09:54,130 --> 01:09:57,463
Let me tell you about this boat
I picked out for us.

528
01:10:57,046 --> 01:10:59,679
You okay?

529
01:11:00,366 --> 01:11:04,799
My mom would kill me
if she knew I took the Rover.

530
01:11:39,004 --> 01:11:44,270
- She didn't come home last night?
- But her clothes are still here.

531
01:11:45,484 --> 01:11:49,850
Walter, if you get sick,
it'll serve you right.

532
01:11:50,883 --> 01:11:55,683
He found some teeth in a trailer.
He says they'll fit.

533
01:11:56,804 --> 01:11:59,871
Suzie hasn't been at school
since the trial.

534
01:12:00,643 --> 01:12:03,676
Now they're saying
she can't graduate.

535
01:12:04,443 --> 01:12:07,609
Kelly Van Ryan got her
into this whole mess.

536
01:12:08,402 --> 01:12:12,902
We'll look into it for you, Ruby.
If we find something, you'll know.

537
01:12:14,842 --> 01:12:17,309
Come on.

538
01:12:33,721 --> 01:12:38,254
- This is how it begins.
- We don't know anything yet.

539
01:12:39,321 --> 01:12:42,821
- Put a call out on Suzie's car.
- Going somewhere?

540
01:12:43,681 --> 01:12:48,047
- You got a date?
- Just check the car out, please.

541
01:12:56,760 --> 01:12:59,560
It's over here, by that old boat.

542
01:13:00,279 --> 01:13:04,079
- You and Suzie came out here?
- Yeah, sometimes.

543
01:13:04,999 --> 01:13:10,499
A lot of the kids hang out here.
Did something bad happen to Suzie?

544
01:13:11,760 --> 01:13:15,060
Did Lombardo ever come out here?

545
01:13:15,879 --> 01:13:21,112
- I say something funny?
- Just the idea that he would . . .

546
01:13:22,319 --> 01:13:25,119
I heard he was pretty tight
with the kids.

547
01:13:25,837 --> 01:13:29,670
- You and he were pals, right?
- He got me on the sailing team.

548
01:13:30,598 --> 01:13:33,064
To work my way through college,
like him.

549
01:13:33,718 --> 01:13:39,218
He got an athletic scholarship.
Boats had nothing to do with it.

550
01:14:29,876 --> 01:14:34,509
I'm going to be here a while, kid.
Why don't you catch the bus?

551
01:14:40,153 --> 01:14:43,187
Jimmy . . .

552
01:14:43,953 --> 01:14:47,353
People aren't always
what they appear. Don't forget.

553
01:15:04,793 --> 01:15:10,359
They did it here. The body must be
in the swamp. But he made a mistake.

554
01:15:11,633 --> 01:15:16,333
- The car was at the bus terminal.
- Couldn't Sam have put it there?

555
01:15:17,432 --> 01:15:20,765
Hold on a second.
Have the car dusted for prints.

556
01:15:21,591 --> 01:15:25,757
If Suzie was murdered, it was
probably Kelly. She started it all.

557
01:15:26,752 --> 01:15:30,652
- How long will it take?
- We can get blood type now.

558
01:15:31,591 --> 01:15:34,224
You want DNA, it could take weeks.

559
01:15:34,911 --> 01:15:38,677
Poor dumb Suzie. Never had
a chance. And Kelly's next!

560
01:15:39,590 --> 01:15:42,490
You get off this. Right now.

561
01:15:43,230 --> 01:15:46,663
Don't even let me hear
about you bothering Lombardo.

562
01:15:50,631 --> 01:15:54,997
David ! You get an ID,
you call me.

563
01:15:57,029 --> 01:16:00,129
- Will you do me one favour?
- Ray, you heard him.

564
01:16:00,908 --> 01:16:04,242
He told me to stay away, not you.
What if I'm right?

565
01:16:05,069 --> 01:16:08,036
You got to help me out on this,
partner.

566
01:16:08,789 --> 01:16:15,989
- And if the teeth aren't Suzie's?
- If I'm wrong, I'll give this up.

567
01:16:58,826 --> 01:17:02,659
- Hello.
- I want to see you.

568
01:17:03,585 --> 01:17:07,218
I'm in the guesthouse.
Sam, I'm really nervous.

569
01:17:08,105 --> 01:17:12,439
Kelly, relax.
Take one of your mom's valiums.

570
01:17:13,465 --> 01:17:16,365
In another week it's over.
We're rich.

571
01:17:17,104 --> 01:17:21,438
What if they find out? They'd
put you in the electric chair.

572
01:17:22,464 --> 01:17:25,864
Stay in the guesthouse.
Skip the graduation parties.

573
01:17:26,703 --> 01:17:28,837
I love you so much.

574
01:17:29,424 --> 01:17:32,657
I love you, too.
Be a good girl, stay where you are.

575
01:17:55,501 --> 01:17:59,101
Peeping in people's windows . . .
isn't that illegal?

576
01:18:01,702 --> 01:18:04,935
- Suzie Toller's missing.
- Since when?

577
01:18:05,742 --> 01:18:09,475
She didn't come home last night.
We found her car.

578
01:18:10,381 --> 01:18:15,015
- Ray thinks she was murdered.
- I don't know what to tell you.

579
01:18:16,102 --> 01:18:21,569
- Tell me where you were last night.
- I don't have to, do I?

580
01:18:26,220 --> 01:18:30,087
Come here.
I want to show you something.

581
01:18:41,020 --> 01:18:43,153
Looks like goodbye . . .

582
01:18:43,738 --> 01:18:48,105
Kelly's file. Read it. You'll find
an angry, sexually confused girl -

583
01:18:49,139 --> 01:18:51,239
- who threatened to kill two people.

584
01:18:51,819 --> 01:18:55,085
- What two people?
- One was her mother.

585
01:18:55,900 --> 01:19:00,833
The other one was . . .
a female classmate -

586
01:19:01,978 --> 01:19:04,978
- that she may have been
sexually involved with.

587
01:19:05,739 --> 01:19:11,205
- Suzie?
- You've got the file. Read it.

588
01:19:13,098 --> 01:19:16,631
It'll give you
a new perspective on things.

589
01:19:17,497 --> 01:19:21,697
Why didn't you tell us about this
before the trial?

590
01:19:22,697 --> 01:19:27,797
Because then I had principles
that meant a lot to me.

591
01:19:28,976 --> 01:19:31,243
Now . . .

592
01:19:31,856 --> 01:19:35,123
. . . I don't care.

593
01:19:47,256 --> 01:19:50,289
I should probably go now.

594
01:19:51,056 --> 01:19:55,090
Unless you plan
to hold me for something.

595
01:20:21,173 --> 01:20:24,273
What's happening?
Where's Lombardo?

596
01:20:25,054 --> 01:20:28,120
- He's gone.
- The blood type matches Suzie's.

597
01:20:28,893 --> 01:20:32,326
There's more to this story
than you know.

598
01:20:33,173 --> 01:20:36,507
If Suzie is dead, I think
Hunter may be right about Kelly.

599
01:20:39,332 --> 01:20:42,165
Ray? Shit.

600
01:20:53,012 --> 01:20:57,745
- Who is it?
- Detective Duquette. Open the gate.

601
01:21:28,210 --> 01:21:31,710
- Hello, Kelly.
- What are you doing here?

602
01:21:47,688 --> 01:21:51,188
Where's Kelly?

603
01:21:58,247 --> 01:22:01,547
I just looked away for a second.
Just a split second.

604
01:22:02,368 --> 01:22:06,701
And just like that, bingo,
she put a knee in my groin.

605
01:22:07,728 --> 01:22:12,062
I didn't go down,
but it slowed me down just enough.

606
01:22:13,087 --> 01:22:18,420
I couldn't get to her.
She turned on me with the gun.

607
01:22:19,648 --> 01:22:23,481
Fired one shot.
I took the hit in the shoulder.

608
01:22:26,527 --> 01:22:29,894
I had no choice.

609
01:22:32,847 --> 01:22:38,280
I had to return fire.
Two rounds, I think. In the chest.

610
01:22:42,366 --> 01:22:45,333
I went there to protect her.

611
01:22:47,406 --> 01:22:49,873
I went there to protect her.

612
01:22:50,525 --> 01:22:50,558
Duquette, in Military Intelligence
we had a saying:

613
01:22:50,565 --> 01:22:54,932
Duquette, in Military Intelligence
we had a saying:

614
01:22:55,965 --> 01:23:00,365
"Once is chance, twice coincidence,
three times is enemy action."

615
01:23:01,406 --> 01:23:06,239
This is twice for you, Duquette.
There will be no third time.

616
01:23:07,365 --> 01:23:10,465
That this was a "good" shooting,
is irrelevant.

617
01:23:11,245 --> 01:23:16,278
You ignored your superiors.
Consequently, two women are dead.

618
01:23:17,444 --> 01:23:20,778
You are terminated
without pension or benefits.

619
01:23:21,605 --> 01:23:28,372
Duquette found Susan Toller's teeth
and blood at Stoner Beach.

620
01:23:29,882 --> 01:23:32,615
Her blood was also
in the Van Ryan car.

621
01:23:33,324 --> 01:23:38,557
This leads us to conclude that she
was murdered by Kelly Van Ryan.

622
01:23:39,763 --> 01:23:42,363
She didn't.

623
01:23:45,323 --> 01:23:47,489
Mr. Duquette . . .

624
01:23:49,361 --> 01:23:52,595
This investigation is concluded.
You're dismissed.

625
01:24:18,240 --> 01:24:20,773
Thank you.

626
01:25:12,477 --> 01:25:14,944
Howdy, partner.

627
01:25:15,597 --> 01:25:19,264
I wasn't expecting you
until tomorrow.

628
01:25:23,197 --> 01:25:26,331
- Nice girlfriend !
- Why wasn't Kelly just framed?

629
01:25:27,117 --> 01:25:31,550
- The bitch shot me.
- Can't cops disarm people?

630
01:25:32,596 --> 01:25:34,896
Shoot them in the leg?

631
01:25:35,517 --> 01:25:40,617
Did you get squeamish after
you killed Suzie with a wine bottle?

632
01:25:41,795 --> 01:25:44,529
Kelly wasn't supposed to die.

633
01:25:45,236 --> 01:25:48,936
It was perfect. They're convinced
Kelly whacked Suzie.

634
01:25:49,835 --> 01:25:52,969
- I couldn't talk them out of it.
- I don't like surprises.

635
01:25:53,754 --> 01:25:57,087
"Every cloud has a silver lining."

636
01:25:57,915 --> 01:26:02,348
Now there's no loose ends. After
tomorrow, you'll never see me again.

637
01:26:03,394 --> 01:26:06,428
About tomorrow . . .

638
01:26:07,194 --> 01:26:12,394
I talked to the bank. They say it'll
take two days to make the transfer.

639
01:26:13,593 --> 01:26:16,693
- Bullshit.
- Oh yeah? Call them yourself.

640
01:26:17,474 --> 01:26:22,240
What's your hurry? Kick back for a
day or two. We'll take out the boat.

641
01:26:23,353 --> 01:26:28,019
I've just had it outfitted.
I could use a deckhand.

642
01:26:32,792 --> 01:26:35,592
Here's to large bank accounts.

643
01:26:37,552 --> 01:26:41,252
Lighten up, partner.
You're a rich man.

644
01:26:44,071 --> 01:26:47,205
To large accounts,
and no loose ends.

645
01:26:47,993 --> 01:26:50,660
And no loose ends.

646
01:27:07,511 --> 01:27:12,711
See that winch? Take a couple
of turns on it. She's luffing.

647
01:27:18,390 --> 01:27:23,190
- You mean that thing?
- It's a winch to tighten the sails.

648
01:27:24,310 --> 01:27:27,576
- Start cranking.
- This is supposed to be a vacation.

649
01:27:28,389 --> 01:27:30,555
Get yourself a nice power boat.

650
01:27:31,149 --> 01:27:35,449
- I'll make a sailor out of you yet.
- Or get me drowned.

651
01:27:49,548 --> 01:27:53,281
- It's stuck.
- Put a little elbow grease in it.

652
01:27:57,987 --> 01:28:02,821
- It's stuck, I'm telling you.
- The jenny must be caught.

653
01:28:03,948 --> 01:28:06,415
Go starboard and unhook it.

654
01:28:07,067 --> 01:28:09,900
I don't understand a word
you just said.

655
01:28:10,627 --> 01:28:15,160
Follow this line, and see
if you can see what it's snagged on.

656
01:28:17,827 --> 01:28:20,727
You're killing me.

657
01:28:27,826 --> 01:28:31,726
- You mean this thing?
- That's it. See anything?

658
01:28:36,705 --> 01:28:39,305
Look a little lower.
That's it.

659
01:28:48,624 --> 01:28:51,858
Guess I forgot to tell you, Ray.

660
01:28:52,665 --> 01:28:57,032
"One hand for the boat,
the other for yourself."

661
01:29:21,904 --> 01:29:25,770
- What happened?
- Nice try, motherfucker!

662
01:29:34,462 --> 01:29:37,662
You're . . . you're dead !

663
01:29:38,902 --> 01:29:41,036
No, I'm not.

664
01:29:42,821 --> 01:29:47,088
- Sam, for Christ's sake.
- Sorry, partner.

665
01:29:48,102 --> 01:29:52,269
You shouldn't have killed Kelly.
Or that kid out in the Glades.

666
01:29:53,260 --> 01:29:56,893
- What was his name?
- Davy.

667
01:30:09,301 --> 01:30:14,134
That's my son, Walter. He's done
this a long time. Don't be afraid.

668
01:30:16,061 --> 01:30:18,961
Thank you for coming
down to the Glades.

669
01:30:32,059 --> 01:30:35,826
Did you come to watch Walter,
or is this an official visit?

670
01:30:36,738 --> 01:30:41,138
- No, it's my day off.
- I thought you looked different.

671
01:30:42,179 --> 01:30:46,579
- I was hoping you would talk to me.
- About Suzie?

672
01:30:47,619 --> 01:30:52,252
Actually I was wondering if you
would talk to me about Ray Duquette.

673
01:30:56,578 --> 01:31:01,978
He used to come here. He had
a thing going with one of the girls.

674
01:31:03,217 --> 01:31:05,917
"Girls" . . . over at the Glades.

675
01:31:07,377 --> 01:31:10,877
Got sort of hung up on her,
from what I hear.

676
01:31:11,737 --> 01:31:15,104
- Does she still work there?
- Not after that night.

677
01:31:15,936 --> 01:31:20,803
All I know is, next morning
she was gone and a boy was dead.

678
01:31:21,936 --> 01:31:26,069
A Seminole kid named Davy.
He had a crush on Ray's whore.

679
01:31:30,255 --> 01:31:34,455
He caught Ray slapping her around,
and tried to stop it.

680
01:31:35,455 --> 01:31:38,221
So Ray killed him.

681
01:31:38,936 --> 01:31:42,936
Suzie saw it, so he busted her.

682
01:31:43,895 --> 01:31:49,028
Sent her up,
just to prove that he could.

683
01:31:50,216 --> 01:31:52,616
That's all
there is to say about him.

684
01:32:03,935 --> 01:32:08,968
To Ray.
We won, Sam. It's over.

685
01:32:16,813 --> 01:32:20,547
Talk about paranoid !
Take a look around us, Sam.

686
01:32:21,452 --> 01:32:25,852
You'll have to teach me to drive
this, before I can get rid of you.

687
01:32:36,453 --> 01:32:38,886
Okay, Toller.
I want to trim the sail.

688
01:32:39,532 --> 01:32:42,732
- Take hold of that winch.
- No, I want to drive.

689
01:32:43,532 --> 01:32:47,399
You don't drive it, you sail it.

690
01:32:48,332 --> 01:32:53,399
Now get on that winch.
I just want to cruise for a while.

691
01:32:57,892 --> 01:33:01,592
That's one of the first things
I noticed about you.

692
01:33:02,491 --> 01:33:04,558
You like to cruise.

693
01:33:06,810 --> 01:33:10,077
- Suzie . . .
- Take college, for instance.

694
01:33:10,889 --> 01:33:15,122
I bet you only took classes
if the finals were multiple choice.

695
01:33:16,129 --> 01:33:19,095
You bought no books.
You'd borrow a girl's -

696
01:33:19,850 --> 01:33:22,616
- and then you'd have to fuck her.

697
01:33:23,330 --> 01:33:26,130
Is that how it went?

698
01:33:27,848 --> 01:33:30,648
Yeah.

699
01:33:31,369 --> 01:33:35,402
Well, I've got a good pop quiz
for you. Multiple choice, of course.

700
01:33:37,608 --> 01:33:43,274
Before sailing away, Medea killed
King Creon and the princess with . .?

701
01:33:45,288 --> 01:33:47,221
A rock?

702
01:33:47,768 --> 01:33:50,768
A spear gun? Or . . .

703
01:33:51,528 --> 01:33:55,028
- A little poison?
- Poison !

704
01:33:59,328 --> 01:34:01,428
Good guess!

705
01:34:31,405 --> 01:34:34,038
Nice truck.

706
01:34:40,844 --> 01:34:43,910
Selling your boat?

707
01:34:47,524 --> 01:34:52,258
This was Suzie's boat.
Guess she won't be needing it now.

708
01:34:54,363 --> 01:34:58,530
Funny, I wouldn't have guessed
Suzie was a sailor.

709
01:35:00,643 --> 01:35:06,543
The old lady had her tested once.
Her IQ was way up, around 200.

710
01:35:08,684 --> 01:35:12,350
That girl could do anything
she put her mind to.

711
01:36:19,398 --> 01:36:23,531
You know, when I got busted
I called you about 100 times.

712
01:36:28,998 --> 01:36:33,531
I really believed that stuff
about you being my friend.

713
01:36:34,598 --> 01:36:37,531
Was I naive!

714
01:36:40,359 --> 01:36:42,359
What came out better?

715
01:36:42,917 --> 01:36:46,917
That straw up Kelly's nose,
or that dog collar around your neck?

716
01:36:47,877 --> 01:36:50,811
What do you think, Mr. Lombardo?

717
01:37:05,116 --> 01:37:09,549
He seems to like the same places
you do. Funny you never met.

718
01:37:10,595 --> 01:37:15,661
Real funny. You're wrong about this,
and I could get busted right here.

719
01:37:16,836 --> 01:37:21,436
Trust me, the guy's dirty, he'll
love it. Especially killing me.

720
01:37:22,514 --> 01:37:25,014
Get out of here,
make a new friend.

721
01:37:37,553 --> 01:37:40,120
What are you drinking?

722
01:37:51,754 --> 01:37:55,887
Got the pressure too tight.
You'll crush the fucking evidence.

723
01:38:00,153 --> 01:38:03,219
For Christ's sake.

724
01:38:16,872 --> 01:38:20,072
- Hello, Kelly.
- What are you doing here?

725
01:39:04,589 --> 01:39:07,822
May I ask you a question,
Miss Toller?

726
01:39:08,629 --> 01:39:12,529
Did you enjoy being
a guest of the state?

727
01:39:13,948 --> 01:39:17,148
Boy, I hope I never make you mad.

728
01:39:20,028 --> 01:39:22,562
The cash is just
walking-around money.

729
01:39:23,228 --> 01:39:27,195
The cheque is the account, minus
a million for Ruby and Walter -

730
01:39:28,147 --> 01:39:30,580
- plus my usual fee.

731
01:39:31,227 --> 01:39:34,060
Case closed.

732
01:39:44,747 --> 01:39:47,381
Suzie . . .

733
01:39:48,867 --> 01:39:51,767
Be good.

up until Iast night, for the past two years.

176
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:44,387
I'm not going to kill again

177
00:17:45,763 --> 00:17:49,563
and I am not going to quit coming here
because it upsets you.

178
00:17:51,002 --> 00:17:53,937
We need a clean-up crew for afterwards.

179
00:17:54,138 --> 00:17:56,299
We need some volunteers for the...

180
00:17:56,674 --> 00:17:58,471
Thank you, Earl. I appreciate that.

181
00:18:10,555 --> 00:18:13,615
Based on your requirements,
this is our first attempt...

182
00:18:13,858 --> 00:18:17,589
SUNDA Y ON PA: Mr. Brooks, your daughter
is waiting for you in your office.

183
00:18:20,231 --> 00:18:22,426
Well, I hope this is what you had in mind.

184
00:18:22,533 --> 00:18:26,367
If not, we would Iove to work with you
further on the design.

185
00:18:26,604 --> 00:18:29,402
It's always fun to challenge our machines.

186
00:18:29,674 --> 00:18:31,699
Now, if you gentlemen would excuse me,

187
00:18:31,809 --> 00:18:34,903
I need to see how much
this is going to cost me.

188
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:38,542
Understand. Daughter cost money.

189
00:18:38,783 --> 00:18:40,080
Me, too.

190
00:18:42,186 --> 00:18:44,347
I believe you do understand.

191
00:18:44,655 --> 00:18:47,988
SUNDAY: Matt Johnson wants to schedule
a Iunch for Friday. Can I talk to...

192
00:18:48,092 --> 00:18:50,788
-Sunday, did...
-Can you hold just a second?

193
00:18:53,431 --> 00:18:55,558
Did Jane call and say she was coming?

194
00:18:55,666 --> 00:18:58,362
I would have given you that message,
Mr. Brooks.

195
00:18:59,137 --> 00:19:00,900
-She in there?
-Yeah. She...

196
00:19:01,439 --> 00:19:04,499
She has some boxes
and suitcases downstairs.

197
00:19:04,609 --> 00:19:07,043
And she didn't have any money
for the cab.

198
00:19:07,778 --> 00:19:09,575
And you paid for that?

199
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:11,307
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

200
00:19:11,415 --> 00:19:13,212
-Hold my calls.
-Sure.

201
00:19:13,618 --> 00:19:15,085
I told you.

202
00:19:15,853 --> 00:19:17,787
When it's appropriate.

203
00:19:17,955 --> 00:19:19,547
You Iet me know.

204
00:19:21,259 --> 00:19:22,351
And could I have some water?

205
00:19:23,861 --> 00:19:25,488
Hello, gorgeous.

206
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:30,357
What are you doing here?

207
00:19:30,501 --> 00:19:32,128
I'm sorry, Daddy.

208
00:19:33,604 --> 00:19:35,697
PIease don't be angry with me.

209
00:19:35,806 --> 00:19:38,366
AII right, I can guess what you've done,
but why don't you tell me,

210
00:19:38,476 --> 00:19:40,706
and then I'II decide.

211
00:19:41,746 --> 00:19:43,714
I dropped out of school.

Oh, Jane.

214
00:19:47,952 --> 00:19:50,580
Okay, have you told your mother?

215
00:19:50,855 --> 00:19:52,823
No, I wanted to talk to you first.

216
00:19:52,924 --> 00:19:54,755
Well, you're going to have to tell her,
Jane, all right?

217
00:19:54,859 --> 00:19:56,258
I'm not going to do that for you.

219
00:19:57,562 --> 00:19:59,086
-Why can't you...
-Sit.

220
00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:03,132
And then, together,
the three of us will decide

221
00:20:03,334 --> 00:20:04,824
where to go from here.

222
00:20:04,936 --> 00:20:08,963
Okay, but I've thought a Iot about this.
College is a waste of time for me.

223
00:20:09,941 --> 00:20:11,101
How does...

224
00:20:11,676 --> 00:20:15,009
How does somebody know that halfway
through their freshman year?

225
00:20:15,112 --> 00:20:17,945
You didn't even go to college, Daddy,
and you're successful.

226
00:20:18,049 --> 00:20:20,176
I want to come work for you.

227
00:20:22,587 --> 00:20:26,148
She's not telling you everything.
She's hiding something.

228
00:20:26,724 --> 00:20:27,884
I know.

229
00:20:32,163 --> 00:20:33,596
I'm not hiring right now, sweetheart.

230
00:20:33,698 --> 00:20:35,427
Okay, but just Iisten to me for one second.

231
00:20:35,533 --> 00:20:36,500
Jane.

232
00:20:36,901 --> 00:20:37,959
AII right.

233
00:20:38,169 --> 00:20:39,966
Look, what would happen to the business,

234
00:20:40,071 --> 00:20:43,165
if, God forbid,
something were to happen to you?

235
00:20:43,941 --> 00:20:44,999
Okay.

236
00:20:45,109 --> 00:20:47,976
Mom would probably have to
sell to strangers.

237
00:20:48,312 --> 00:20:50,246
Now, Iook,
I'm willing to start at the bottom.

238
00:20:50,381 --> 00:20:52,872
You can treat me Iike a regular employee.

239
00:20:53,184 --> 00:20:57,587
I just want to Iearn everything there is
to know about running the box business.

240
00:20:57,688 --> 00:20:59,815
Then, when the time comes,

241
00:21:00,858 --> 00:21:02,883
it can stay in the family.

242
00:21:03,494 --> 00:21:04,461
Hmm.

243
00:21:06,130 --> 00:21:08,189
Well, that's sweet, honey, but

244
00:21:08,432 --> 00:21:11,265
you're not talking about business.
You're talking about emotion.

245
00:21:11,369 --> 00:21:12,893
Now, get up.

246
00:21:13,004 --> 00:21:16,770
In fact, your mother and I came this close
to selling out Iast year.

247
00:21:16,874 --> 00:21:17,932
-What?
-That's right.

248
00:21:18,042 --> 00:21:19,703
And had we been offered
a Iittle more money,

249
00:21:19,810 --> 00:21:23,041
and they still may come back to us,
we would sell.

250
00:21:23,981 --> 00:21:25,243

Yes?

253
00:21:31,622 --> 00:21:35,023
I'm sorry. The man outside insisted
that I give this to you.

254
00:21:35,126 --> 00:21:38,789
He claims that you'II find what's
inside very interesting.

255
00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:41,360
What is he, Sunday? Is he a salesman?

256
00:21:41,499 --> 00:21:44,525
I've never seen him before. I'II just
give it back to him. I'II tell him to call...

257
00:21:44,635 --> 00:21:46,535
No, Sunday. Sunday, here.

258
00:21:47,938 --> 00:21:48,996
Thank you.

259
00:21:53,044 --> 00:21:54,011
Jane,

260
00:21:54,512 --> 00:21:58,744
part of spending four years at college
is to give yourself a chance

261
00:21:58,849 --> 00:22:00,339
to find out

262
00:22:06,891 --> 00:22:08,415
who you are

263
00:22:09,327 --> 00:22:11,295
and what you want to do.

264
00:22:12,963 --> 00:22:16,228
I'II talk to Mom,
but I'm not going back to school.

265
00:22:16,967 --> 00:22:17,934
Mmm-hmm.

266
00:22:19,603 --> 00:22:21,594
And where would you Iive?

267
00:22:22,206 --> 00:22:24,174
To save money, I would move back home.

268
00:22:24,275 --> 00:22:27,540
But no rules, no curfew.
I want to be treated as an adult.

269
00:22:27,645 --> 00:22:29,738
And would you pay for rent?

270
00:22:31,349 --> 00:22:32,680
Hmm?

271
00:22:33,651 --> 00:22:35,243
Would you pay for food?

272
00:22:35,786 --> 00:22:40,052
No, Dad. You're a very wealthy man.
I think you can afford to keep me.

273
00:22:40,991 --> 00:22:43,892
Sunday, would you show the gentleman
who gave you the envelope

274
00:22:43,994 --> 00:22:47,054
into the conference room and tell him
that I will meet him there?

It'II be here next weekend.

Are you going to give me a job?

282
00:23:11,422 --> 00:23:15,085
If it were up to me, and I think your
mother will agree with this,

283
00:23:16,193 --> 00:23:18,787
I think you should go back to school.

That's why I didn't want to
do the dance couple!

Stop your fucking whining, Earl.

287
00:23:28,105 --> 00:23:30,596

much as I did.

period!

is for you to take me with you
next time you kill someone.

this was going to be unpleasant?

that you've decided never to kill again

00:26:59,850 --> 00:27:02,751
You can never call me.
Do you understand that?

349
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:04,044
Yes.

350
00:27:04,722 --> 00:27:05,814
Okay.

351
00:27:07,691 --> 00:27:09,318
Tomorrow night.

352
00:27:09,793 --> 00:27:12,489
Not tonight. Tomorrow night at 8:00,

353
00:27:12,596 --> 00:27:15,656
Ieave your apartment building
and walk east.

354
00:27:15,766 --> 00:27:17,666
I'II pick you up there.

355
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:28,368
-If you're thinking about doing anything...
-We're both aware of the rules, Mr. Smith.

356
00:27:30,447 --> 00:27:32,540
But I feel I must warn you.

357
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:36,080
If it turns out that you enjoy killing,

358
00:27:36,654 --> 00:27:38,884
it can become very addictive.

359
00:27:39,790 --> 00:27:41,781
It could ruin your Iife.

360
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,055
I want to do this.

361
00:27:46,230 --> 00:27:47,527
Okay.

362
00:27:51,368 --> 00:27:53,233
Have I covered everything?

363
00:27:53,437 --> 00:27:55,735
I can't think of anything else.

364
00:27:56,407 --> 00:27:59,308
Then I'II see you tomorrow night,
Mr. Smith.

365
00:28:11,689 --> 00:28:13,088
HART: We've talked to our client

366
00:28:13,190 --> 00:28:17,092
and we've come up with a figure
that we feel is more than fair.

367
00:28:18,796 --> 00:28:21,856
We can have a check for that amount
in your office by 6:00.

368
00:28:21,965 --> 00:28:25,992
Oh, well, we told you in the beginning
what we wanted. That hasn't changed.

369
00:28:26,103 --> 00:28:29,334
We feel our offer is more than generous.

370
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:31,931
I paid for everything
while we were together.

371
00:28:32,042 --> 00:28:35,603
And now I'm being asked
to give this guy a bonus?

372
00:28:36,714 --> 00:28:41,378
For spending time with me? Time that I've
already paid for in the first place?

373
00:28:41,485 --> 00:28:45,546
You know as well as I do, counselor,
you're not going to get $1.5 million.

374
00:28:45,656 --> 00:28:48,454
Oh, I don't know that. No.

375
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:52,222
Well, in fact, this is the front page of
yesterday's paper.

376
00:28:54,064 --> 00:28:56,055
"Hangman escapes."

377
00:28:56,166 --> 00:29:00,933
"After torturing his victims, Thorton
Meeks would hang them in public places,

378
00:29:01,038 --> 00:29:04,201
"church steeples, balconies,
freeway overpasses..."

379
00:29:04,308 --> 00:29:06,071
Where is this going?

380
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:09,236
Well, your client captured Mr. Meeks.

381
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:12,945
Come on, Tracy,
this is not a Iot of money for you.

382
00:29:13,550 --> 00:29:15,245
And we both know how frightened I was

383
00:29:15,352 --> 00:29:18,185
after Meeks said he was going to escape
and come back and kill you.

384
00:29:18,288 --> 00:29:19,915
Let me ask again.

385
00:29:20,591 --> 00:29:21,751
What is your point?

386
00:29:21,859 --> 00:29:25,488
Our point is that Meeks
or someone Iike Meeks

387
00:29:25,596 --> 00:29:29,054
may come after my client
in order to hurt your client.

388
00:29:29,733 --> 00:29:32,133
That's very imaginative, counselor,

389
00:29:32,236 --> 00:29:34,932
but it's not based in reality at all.

390
00:29:35,239 --> 00:29:36,399
Jesse?

391
00:29:36,507 --> 00:29:38,668
Now, just Iet us handle this, please?

392
00:29:38,776 --> 00:29:39,868
-Tracy...
-Jesse,

393
00:29:39,977 --> 00:29:43,469
you know what would make me feel
really safe right now?

394
00:29:46,450 --> 00:29:48,611
If you got hit by a truck

395
00:29:48,819 --> 00:29:50,116
and died.

396
00:29:52,322 --> 00:29:53,880
Well, that's it.

397
00:29:53,991 --> 00:29:56,186
Mr. Vialo and I are Ieaving.

398
00:29:56,293 --> 00:29:58,727
You've threatened the safety of my client.

399
00:29:59,163 --> 00:30:01,393
We're going to have to
get a restraining order.

400
00:30:01,498 --> 00:30:03,125
See you in court.

401
00:30:04,701 --> 00:30:06,931
"Get hit by a truck and die."

402
00:30:08,739 --> 00:30:10,673
Fuck it. It felt good.

403
00:30:11,241 --> 00:30:14,438
It's not what's here,
it's what's not here that's interesting.

404
00:30:14,545 --> 00:30:17,514
I mean, if I didn't know better, I'd say
these people were killed by a ghost.

405
00:30:17,714 --> 00:30:22,014
The autopsy said there was a tiny piece
of plastic in the female victim's brain.

406
00:30:22,119 --> 00:30:23,746
It's a dead end. He bags the gun.

407
00:30:23,854 --> 00:30:27,085
He puts a one-gallon plastic freezer
bag over his hand to his wrist.

408
00:30:27,191 --> 00:30:31,628
The Iittle bit of plastic comes out with
the first slug and the shells go in the bag.

409
00:30:31,728 --> 00:30:33,127
I hear you're Iooking for me.

410
00:30:33,230 --> 00:30:36,358
I received a subpoena from your husband
for your work records,

411
00:30:36,466 --> 00:30:39,924
where you were, date and times,
for the past two years.

412
00:30:40,170 --> 00:30:41,967
They're just trying to blackmail me
into a settlement,

413
00:30:42,072 --> 00:30:44,506
but my Iawyers assure me
that it'II never go to court.

414
00:30:44,608 --> 00:30:46,803
I can't take that chance.

415
00:30:46,910 --> 00:30:49,504
AImost three quarters
of your cases are current,

416
00:30:49,613 --> 00:30:53,777
so until you settle your divorce,
I'm going to have to put you on a desk.

417
00:30:53,884 --> 00:30:55,749
That's also blackmail.

418
00:30:56,653 --> 00:30:58,848
Do you have any idea
what this guy has done to me?

419
00:30:58,956 --> 00:31:02,084
While we were married?
While I was paying for everything?

420
00:31:02,192 --> 00:31:04,956
He was just out fucking every woman
he could get his hands on.

421
00:31:05,062 --> 00:31:07,690
He fucked my friends.
He fucked my cousin!

422
00:31:07,798 --> 00:31:09,789
-He made me Iook Iike an idiot.
-And?

423
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:11,492
And what?

424
00:31:11,702 --> 00:31:13,101
Get over it.

425
00:31:13,871 --> 00:31:17,074
You can't grow old as a woman without
having at Ieast one Iousy man in your Iife.

426
00:31:17,074 --> 00:31:17,938
You can't grow old as a woman without
having at Ieast one Iousy man in your Iife.

427
00:31:18,041 --> 00:31:21,204
Well, I made him an offer and I'm not
going to give him a dime more.

428
00:31:21,411 --> 00:31:23,971
-Did you hear that Meeks escaped?
-Yeah.

429
00:31:24,081 --> 00:31:27,710
I've got every unit Iooking for him.
Do you want me to put a detail on you?

430
00:31:27,818 --> 00:31:30,252
I think I can take care of myself.

431
00:31:31,054 --> 00:31:35,753
That's one of your biggest problems,
Tracy. You don't know how to ask for help.

432
00:32:24,408 --> 00:32:26,603
What the fuck? What the fuck?

433
00:32:27,311 --> 00:32:28,573
Don't worry.

434
00:32:28,679 --> 00:32:32,080
If I were here to kill you,
you would already be dead.

(GASPING)

436
00:32:35,819 --> 00:32:40,415
After you Ieft today, I realized that
our friendship was a Iittle one-sided.

437
00:32:40,691 --> 00:32:44,855
So, tomorrow night when we meet,
would you be so kind as to bring

438
00:32:44,962 --> 00:32:48,454
all the pictures and the memory card
from your camera?

439
00:32:48,999 --> 00:32:52,457
That way we can Iike each other
simply for who we are.

440
00:32:53,170 --> 00:32:55,161
If you don't show up,

441
00:32:55,739 --> 00:32:58,731
I will presume that
you've gone to the police

442
00:32:58,909 --> 00:33:00,672
and I will kill you.

443
00:33:01,278 --> 00:33:03,212
Even if I go to jail because of you,
Mr. Smith,

444
00:33:03,313 --> 00:33:06,111
someone will find you, wherever you are,

445
00:33:06,583 --> 00:33:08,483
and they will kill you.

446
00:33:16,994 --> 00:33:18,359
Mr. Brooks?

447
00:33:22,132 --> 00:33:23,531
Mr. Brooks?

448
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:24,767
Mr. Brooks.

449
00:33:37,848 --> 00:33:39,179
Mr. Brooks?

450
00:33:58,201 --> 00:33:59,293
Wow!

451
00:34:46,216 --> 00:34:48,343
It's nice to have you home.

EMMA: Hello. Hello.

00:35:04,601 --> 00:35:08,867

458
00:35:19,382 --> 00:35:20,349
Hmm?

459
00:35:24,254 --> 00:35:26,848
Ask your daughter what the real reason is
she dropped out of school.

460
00:35:26,957 --> 00:35:29,323
I told you, it's not the real reason.

461
00:35:29,426 --> 00:35:31,360
Honey, you wanted to go to college.

462
00:35:31,595 --> 00:35:34,359
You had good grades. Your father pulled in
favors to get you into that school.

463
00:35:34,464 --> 00:35:37,490
If this isn't the reason, then please,
dear God, tell me the reason.

464
00:35:37,701 --> 00:35:41,501
Why does your mother think
that you've dropped out of school?

465
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:45,234
I'm pregnant.

466
00:35:45,342 --> 00:35:46,809
But that's not the reason I dropped out.

467
00:35:46,910 --> 00:35:51,074
Being pregnant wouldn't keep me
from going to school if I wanted to.

468
00:35:56,119 --> 00:35:57,780
Who's the father?

469
00:35:58,622 --> 00:36:00,487
Some guy I was seeing.

470
00:36:00,624 --> 00:36:02,182
Some guy? Does he know?

471
00:36:02,526 --> 00:36:04,960
Of course he knows, Dad.
He's married and got two kids

472
00:36:05,061 --> 00:36:06,551

474
00:36:09,533 --> 00:36:10,864
Oh, honey.

475
00:36:11,001 --> 00:36:13,526
I'm not going to go through with it,
so there's nothing to be upset about.

I mean, I wasn't even going
to tell you guys.

No, Dad. You're not going
to tell me what to do, okay?

It's my body and I'II do what I want with it.

I'm sorry, you're right. I said it wrong.

I wasn't trying to tell you what to do.
What I was...

What I was trying to say is that

want to have a grandchild?

Yes.

00:37:00,917 --> 00:37:04,148
We would Iove it
and cherish it completely. And we would...

490
00:37:05,255 --> 00:37:07,348
We would help you raise it.

I'II think about it.

00:37:35,318 --> 00:37:38,845
Pregnant's not all of it.
She's hiding something bigger.

497
00:37:43,827 --> 00:37:45,761
Something much bigger.

00:37:45,895 --> 00:37:47,988

-I know so.

But still...

502
00:38:58,702 --> 00:39:01,899
How did you manage to not
bump into the furniture?

503
00:39:16,686 --> 00:39:19,484
Was the Iight on? Or did you turn it on?

504
00:39:19,756 --> 00:39:23,214
Because I know you,
and you wouldn't risk a shot in the dark.

Where have you been?

00:39:36,806 --> 00:39:39,297
Did you miss the thrill of killing?

508
00:39:48,184 --> 00:39:50,584
What if these are stuck closed

509
00:39:51,254 --> 00:39:53,552
because you yanked them closed?

No. My father does nothing for nothing.

has a Iot of political muscle.

01:04:58,927 --> 01:05:00,292
Gosh.

858
01:05:02,197 --> 01:05:04,631
Well, I'm sure if she was close
to somebody who was murdered

859
01:05:04,733 --> 01:05:06,132
she would've said something.

860
01:05:06,234 --> 01:05:07,394
Yeah.

861
01:05:09,704 --> 01:05:12,867
I called Roger.
He suggested a criminal attorney.

862
01:05:13,842 --> 01:05:16,037
They'II be here within the hour.

863
01:05:18,513 --> 01:05:20,378
Yeah. I'II get dressed.

864
01:05:22,717 --> 01:05:25,686
-This is too close.
-I know!

865
01:05:35,830 --> 01:05:38,025
CARFAGNO: Jane,
how well did you know Phillip Ramsey?

866
01:05:38,133 --> 01:05:42,069
He and I were in a couple classes together,
but that's about it.

867
01:05:42,170 --> 01:05:44,832
-Did you ever drive him to class?
-No.

868
01:05:46,241 --> 01:05:49,142
You ever been to his apartment?
Do you know where he Iives?

869
01:05:49,244 --> 01:05:52,771
-Which complex was he in?
-What happened to your BMW, Jane?

870
01:05:53,748 --> 01:05:57,775
It was actually stolen,
Sunday night or Monday morning.

871
01:05:59,487 --> 01:06:00,681
ROGER: Detective, hold on a second.

872
01:06:00,789 --> 01:06:03,451
My understanding
is that she's not a suspect.

873
01:07:00,281 --> 01:07:02,044
Well, that was interesting.

874
01:07:03,852 --> 01:07:08,414
-You know, I don't feel so well.
-I think you should Iie down. Okay?

875
01:07:08,523 --> 01:07:10,320
I think she should Iie down.

876
01:07:16,898 --> 01:07:20,197
Dad, I'm sorry I didn't say anything before.

877
01:07:20,301 --> 01:07:24,362
It was really horrible,
but, I didn't know the guy that well and...

878
01:07:24,472 --> 01:07:27,100
It happened around the same time
I found out I was pregnant,

879
01:07:27,208 --> 01:07:30,735
-so it just kind of went out of my mind.
-I understand.

880
01:07:36,217 --> 01:07:38,344
I'm going to go up with her.

881
01:07:49,931 --> 01:07:51,990
God help me. What do I do?

882
01:07:57,005 --> 01:07:58,438
She did it.

883
01:07:59,641 --> 01:08:01,108
Didn't she?

884
01:08:02,877 --> 01:08:04,174
Yeah.

885
01:08:05,380 --> 01:08:10,010
It'II take the cops a week to 10 days
to put their case together and then...

886
01:08:11,219 --> 01:08:14,017
And then they will come back
and arrest her.

887
01:08:18,693 --> 01:08:20,718
What are you going to do?

888
01:08:42,117 --> 01:08:43,448
Oh, God.

889
01:08:44,152 --> 01:08:48,054
Oh, God! I've been afraid of this
since before she was born.

890
01:08:50,291 --> 01:08:51,553
She has...

891
01:08:52,660 --> 01:08:54,355
She has what I have.

892
01:08:55,130 --> 01:08:56,620
Yes, she does.

893
01:08:57,732 --> 01:09:00,963
But you were always smart about it.
She was stupid.

894
01:09:03,338 --> 01:09:07,172
She did it because she got off on it.
Okay, I understand.

895
01:09:07,275 --> 01:09:10,244
She did it for fun. Okay, I understand.

896
01:09:11,613 --> 01:09:17,483
But why didn't she think it through?
A hatchet? And she Ieft it there?

897
01:09:22,624 --> 01:09:24,455
They were pretty graphic, weren't they?

898
01:09:24,559 --> 01:09:26,686
That was to shock her
into making a mistake.

899
01:09:26,794 --> 01:09:28,591
What does she think I think?

900
01:09:30,165 --> 01:09:31,530
Didn't she remember what she told me,

901
01:09:31,633 --> 01:09:35,399
that the BMW was being driven across
the country by a friend?

902
01:09:35,503 --> 01:09:38,631
Now, right in front of me,
she tells the cops that it was stolen.

903
01:09:38,740 --> 01:09:42,870
You always cleaned up after her,
whatever she did, all her Iife.

904
01:09:47,882 --> 01:09:51,010
If the BMW
has anything incriminating in it,

905
01:09:51,119 --> 01:09:52,848
I hope it was stolen.

906
01:09:53,121 --> 01:09:55,681
Or she dropped it
at the bottom of a very deep Iake.

907
01:09:55,790 --> 01:09:57,655
Think she knows
how much trouble she's in?

908
01:09:57,759 --> 01:09:59,124
I think...

909
01:09:59,861 --> 01:10:01,886
I think she thought
she'd gotten away with it,

910
01:10:01,996 --> 01:10:04,055
until the cops showed up.

911
01:10:06,467 --> 01:10:08,731
I should have Iistened to her.

912
01:10:09,804 --> 01:10:13,240
She was trying to tell me. It was there.

913
01:10:14,676 --> 01:10:17,736
"I didn't quit school
because I was pregnant."

914
01:10:19,013 --> 01:10:20,503
I should've dug deeper.

915
01:10:20,615 --> 01:10:21,716
And where would you be but at exactly
the same place that you are now?

916
01:10:21,716 --> 01:10:25,015
And where would you be but at exactly
the same place that you are now?

917
01:10:25,653 --> 01:10:27,712
It's not your fault, Earl.

918
01:10:28,323 --> 01:10:32,191
Part of your problem with her
is that you always think it is.

919
01:10:32,293 --> 01:10:37,162
She has what I have, Marshall.
So, on a very basic Ievel, it is my fault!

920
01:10:38,499 --> 01:10:40,694
What are you going to do?

921
01:10:56,751 --> 01:11:00,517
Maybe the best thing for her
would be to Iet her go to jail.

922
01:11:06,261 --> 01:11:08,286
What about her child?

923
01:11:08,396 --> 01:11:10,921
Emma and I would help her raise it.

924
01:11:14,302 --> 01:11:17,794
You might be right, Earl. You know?
You just might be.

925
01:11:20,041 --> 01:11:22,271
Because if she's not stopped,
she's going to kill again,

926
01:11:22,377 --> 01:11:27,007
and if she really wants
to take over the box business,

927
01:11:27,115 --> 01:11:29,310
the next victim could be

928
01:11:32,587 --> 01:11:33,747
you.

929
01:11:40,962 --> 01:11:43,362
I don't think she'd go that far.

930
01:11:47,168 --> 01:11:49,193
(PHONE RINGING)

931
01:11:57,612 --> 01:11:58,579
Hey.

932
01:11:58,713 --> 01:12:02,308
We received a counteroffer.
Are you sitting down?

933
01:12:02,850 --> 01:12:06,149
-Yeah, go ahead.
-$5 million.

934
01:12:06,888 --> 01:12:10,824
Oh, my God. You got to be kidding me.
He can't get that, can he?

935
01:12:11,059 --> 01:12:13,619
No, no, no, my sense of it is
that by asking for five

936
01:12:13,728 --> 01:12:16,526
they're hoping you settle
anywhere between 2.5 and 3.

937
01:12:16,631 --> 01:12:18,360
Shit. Can you stall them?

938
01:12:18,766 --> 01:12:20,666
Well,
they know you want this done quickly,

939
01:12:20,768 --> 01:12:22,895
so they're going to expect
a quick counteroffer.

940
01:12:23,171 --> 01:12:26,072
Look, I need two days. Just wait two days.

941
01:12:26,174 --> 01:12:30,907
Tell them that it's a big number
and that I have to think about it.

942
01:12:31,012 --> 01:12:34,948
-Okay.
-Oh, and that picture that he wanted?

943
01:12:39,320 --> 01:12:41,447
Tell him I couldn't find it.

944
01:12:45,993 --> 01:12:47,620
Yes, Mr. Brooks?

945
01:12:49,797 --> 01:12:51,196
Mr. Brooks?

946
01:12:52,867 --> 01:12:54,232
Mr. Brooks?

947
01:12:55,336 --> 01:12:58,863
Before you open your mouth

948
01:12:58,973 --> 01:13:03,376
be very sure this is the right thing to do.

949
01:13:03,911 --> 01:13:06,471
I will never be sure.

950
01:13:09,350 --> 01:13:11,910
You get pissed at me

951
01:13:12,019 --> 01:13:15,921
because I'm always the one
arguing to go ahead and do murder.

952
01:13:16,023 --> 01:13:19,618
Not this time, Earl. This is your decision.

953
01:13:20,294 --> 01:13:24,128
I know it's wrong.
I know in my heart it's wrong.

954
01:13:26,067 --> 01:13:27,728
Then don't do it.

955
01:13:29,704 --> 01:13:32,832
Go with Mr. Smith tonight and finish that

956
01:13:32,940 --> 01:13:37,104
and Iet the police put Jane in jail.
Hopefully that will save her

957
01:13:37,211 --> 01:13:41,739
and we can happily go on
with our tortured Iives.

958
01:13:42,750 --> 01:13:45,548
That's exactly what I want to do.

959
01:13:45,653 --> 01:13:49,817
That's exactly what I should do.
The thing is, she is my daughter.

960
01:13:50,792 --> 01:13:52,419
And I Iove her.

961
01:13:54,095 --> 01:13:55,426
Mr. Brooks?

962
01:14:01,669 --> 01:14:03,227
I'm going home.

963
01:14:05,273 --> 01:14:09,175
-Cancel everything for the rest of the day.
-I'II take care of it.

964
01:14:09,277 --> 01:14:13,407
If you need me, need me, Sunday,
I'II be at my studio.

965
01:14:13,514 --> 01:14:15,038
Call me there.

966
01:14:15,883 --> 01:14:20,377
I probably won't pick up,
so just Ieave a message.

967
01:14:22,156 --> 01:14:24,249
I'II try not to bother you.

968
01:14:53,120 --> 01:14:55,247
The thing that bothers me about this,

969
01:14:55,356 --> 01:14:59,725
besides the fact
that we are not prepared and

970
01:15:00,928 --> 01:15:05,092
a multitude of other things
is what does Mr. Smith do

971
01:15:05,199 --> 01:15:09,829
when he's walking west tonight
and you don't show up?

972
01:15:09,937 --> 01:15:12,428
That Iittle freak could flip out.

973
01:15:14,675 --> 01:15:18,634
I will take care of it
on the way to the airport.

974
01:15:22,517 --> 01:15:23,643
HAWKINS: What are we doing?

975
01:15:23,751 --> 01:15:25,082
TRACY:
What are we doing? What are we doing?

976
01:15:25,186 --> 01:15:28,917
You sound Iike a whiny-ass kid.
We're playing a hunch.

977
01:15:29,023 --> 01:15:31,389
We've been following this guy all day.

978
01:15:31,492 --> 01:15:33,289
He's boring, okay?

979
01:15:33,394 --> 01:15:35,089
And everything we run on him
comes up clean.

980
01:15:35,196 --> 01:15:38,188
Well, if it didn't,
it wouldn't be called a hunch.

981
01:15:38,299 --> 01:15:41,700
Meeks, he's the guy
we should be Iooking for. Meeks.

982
01:15:42,436 --> 01:15:45,462
Look where? PIease, tell me.

983
01:15:46,541 --> 01:15:50,568
Look, everyone knows who Meeks is
and is Iooking for him.

984
01:15:50,678 --> 01:15:53,943
The chiropractor was the Iast Iink
to his old Iife that I know.

985
01:15:54,048 --> 01:15:56,312
If we're going to find him now,
then somebody's going to turn him in,

986
01:15:56,417 --> 01:15:59,944
or we're going to trip over him
at a bus stop.

987
01:16:00,054 --> 01:16:04,354
On the other hand, nobody knows who
the Thumbprint Killer is or where he is.

988
01:16:04,458 --> 01:16:08,326
However, I have a fucking hunch
that this guy, Baffert, does.

989
01:16:08,429 --> 01:16:10,727
I've got two days to play that hunch.

990
01:16:10,831 --> 01:16:12,492
So, if you think
you're wasting your time with me,

991
01:16:12,600 --> 01:16:15,034
then I'd be happy to do it alone.

992
01:16:16,037 --> 01:16:19,996
I had a fight with my wife this morning.
What's your problem?

993
01:16:21,509 --> 01:16:24,307
My husband wants $5 million.

994
01:16:34,722 --> 01:16:37,213
Here you are, sir. Sir?

995
01:16:40,528 --> 01:16:41,825
Thank you.

996
01:16:48,469 --> 01:16:52,769
God, grant me the serenity
to accept the things that I cannot change,

997
01:16:52,873 --> 01:16:56,604
courage to change the things I can,
and wisdom to know the difference.

998
01:16:56,711 --> 01:16:59,981
Living one day at a time,
enjoying one moment at a time.

999

(CAR LOCK BEEPS)

1000
01:17:51,198 --> 01:17:53,291
That's it for you, asshole!

1001
01:18:01,208 --> 01:18:02,539
Remember me?

1002
01:18:02,643 --> 01:18:06,340
Can you step out of the car, please?
I want to talk to you.

1003
01:18:10,551 --> 01:18:12,951
So, Mr. Baffert,
what is it that you have to tell me?

1004
01:18:13,054 --> 01:18:15,284
What do you mean?
I don't have anything to tell you.

1005
01:18:15,389 --> 01:18:19,485
Really? Because I was driving around
and I suddenly got this feeling

1006
01:18:19,593 --> 01:18:22,460
that you had something to tell me
about the murders.

1007
01:18:22,997 --> 01:18:25,795
No. Nothing.

1008
01:18:25,900 --> 01:18:27,993
Well, that's disappointing,

1009
01:18:28,335 --> 01:18:32,772
because when I Ieft,
after we talked Iast time,

1010
01:18:32,873 --> 01:18:35,899
I felt I had missed a clue
that was right in front of me

1011
01:18:36,010 --> 01:18:38,444
that could solve this whole case.

1012
01:18:39,046 --> 01:18:41,708
I don't know why you would feel that.

1013
01:18:42,416 --> 01:18:45,249
Didn't you tell me
that you were an amateur potter,

1014
01:18:45,352 --> 01:18:47,650
that you Iiked to make bowls and vases?

1015
01:18:47,755 --> 01:18:54,354
No, I told you that my hobby
was photography and not pottery.

1016
01:18:56,330 --> 01:18:58,355
Well, maybe that was it.

1017
01:18:59,734 --> 01:19:01,929
The flight attendant upstairs
said the victims

1018
01:19:02,036 --> 01:19:06,029
Iiked to keep their bedroom curtains open
when they had sex.

1019
01:19:06,140 --> 01:19:10,201
Could I see some of those photos
you took of that couple?

1020
01:19:34,235 --> 01:19:37,170
You're harassing me, Detective Atwood.

1021
01:19:37,271 --> 01:19:42,004
You knew very well that I'm not a potter,
and I don't have any pictures.

Why?

1205

I didn't want Jesse dead.

Look, I hated what he was doing to me,
but I didn't want him dead.

it's that people do strange things.

after we go check out this address.

that I was ever there.

from the first murder.

at the second murder?

at just beating the rap.

You're probably asking yourself,
"Why would I help you?"

1243

Well, I am tired, Mr. Smith.

1244

I'm tired of killing, but I'm an addict.
I can't quit.

1245

I've tried, but I cannot do it on my own,
so I need you to kill me.

to cover me.

to accept the things I cannot change,

1354
01:53:59,259 --> 01:54:03,423
courage to change the things I can,
and wisdom to know the difference.

1355
01:54:04,164 --> 01:54:06,564
Living one day at a time
and enjoying one moment at a time,

1356
01:54:06,667 --> 01:54:08,862
accepting hardships
as the pathway to peace.

1357
01:54:08,969 --> 01:54:13,201
Taking, as He did, this sinful world
as it is and not as I would have it,

1358
01:54:13,306 --> 01:54:16,571
trusting that He will make all things
right if I surrender to His will,

1359
01:54:16,677 --> 01:54:19,202
that I may be reasonably happy in this Iife,

1360
01:54:19,312 --> 01:54:23,442
and supremely happy with Him
forever in the next. Amen.

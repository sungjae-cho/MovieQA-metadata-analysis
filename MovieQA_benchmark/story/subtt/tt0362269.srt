1
00:00:26,038 --> 00:00:27,665
Don't sit so far away.

2
00:00:27,739 --> 00:00:30,799
Anything that creates
a distance should be avoided.

3
00:00:30,876 --> 00:00:33,310
OK.

4
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:37,778
And try not to frown.

5
00:00:37,849 --> 00:00:40,750
- I'm sorry. Was I frowning?
- You have to relax.

6
00:00:40,852 --> 00:00:43,821
How can I be expected to open up
if you're not relaxed?

7
00:00:43,889 --> 00:00:45,948
- Right.
- Take a deep breath.

8
00:00:46,024 --> 00:00:49,118
Start again.

9
00:00:49,194 --> 00:00:52,891
As you can see, this piece of paper
has been divided into squares.

10
00:00:52,965 --> 00:00:55,365
There are 287 of them.

11
00:00:55,434 --> 00:00:58,631
Your sex history will fit on this
single page in a cryptic code.

12
00:00:58,704 --> 00:01:01,832
Don't forget to mention
there's no written key to the code.

13
00:01:02,107 --> 00:01:08,342
The subject will only be candid if he knows
he's speaking in the strictest confidence.

14
00:01:08,413 --> 00:01:10,745
Right. OK.

15
00:01:13,118 --> 00:01:15,586
So, when were you born?

16
00:01:15,654 --> 00:01:18,987
June 23, 1894.

17
00:01:19,057 --> 00:01:21,890
- Are you single or married?
- Married.

18
00:01:22,928 --> 00:01:23,952
What is your race?

19
00:01:24,062 --> 00:01:27,429
Don't waste time asking the obvious,
Martin. Fill it in yourself.

20
00:01:27,499 --> 00:01:30,297
- What is your religion?
- Methodist.

21
00:01:30,369 --> 00:01:32,803
- How often do you attend church?
- Not at all now.

22
00:01:32,871 --> 00:01:35,863
But I did regularly until I was 19.

23
00:01:36,475 --> 00:01:39,740
How did you get along with your father
and mother when you were growing up?

24
00:01:39,811 --> 00:01:44,271
That's a multiple question. It allows me
to ignore any part I don't want to answer.

25
00:01:44,349 --> 00:01:49,013
- How did you get along with your mother?
- Fine. We had a close relationship.

26
00:01:49,087 --> 00:01:50,611
And your father?

27
00:01:52,658 --> 00:01:55,991
How did you get along with your father?

28
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,397
And what are we to do?

29
00:02:04,936 --> 00:02:08,099
We turn away from matters of the flesh,

30
00:02:08,173 --> 00:02:12,633
and we turn to things... of the spirit.

31
00:02:15,781 --> 00:02:20,548
Lust has a thousand avenues -

32
00:02:20,619 --> 00:02:24,111
the dance hall, the ice-cream parlor,

33
00:02:24,189 --> 00:02:27,818
the tenement saloon, the Turkish bath.

34
00:02:28,727 --> 00:02:31,161
Like the Hydra...

35
00:02:31,229 --> 00:02:35,131
it grows new heads. Everything.

36
00:02:39,738 --> 00:02:42,571
Even the modern inventions of science

37
00:02:42,641 --> 00:02:45,974
are used to cultivate immorality.

38
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:50,648
The gas engine...

39
00:02:50,716 --> 00:02:54,208
has brought us the automobile joyride.

40
00:02:54,286 --> 00:02:57,551
And an even more pernicious menace,

41
00:02:57,823 --> 00:03:01,088
the roadside brothel.

42
00:03:01,159 --> 00:03:06,153
Electricity... has made possible
the degrading picture show.

43
00:03:06,231 --> 00:03:07,823
Because of the telephone,

44
00:03:07,899 --> 00:03:13,394
a young woman
can hear the voice of her suitor

45
00:03:13,472 --> 00:03:16,737
on the pillow, right next to her.

46
00:03:17,743 --> 00:03:19,870
And let's not forget...

47
00:03:19,945 --> 00:03:22,812
the most scandalous invention of all -

48
00:03:22,881 --> 00:03:27,443
the taloned slide fastener,
otherwise known as the zipper,

49
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:31,319
which provides every man and boy
speedy access...

50
00:03:32,657 --> 00:03:34,522
to moral oblivion!

51
00:03:35,093 --> 00:03:39,291
- Are you currently in good health?
- I suppose so.

52
00:03:39,531 --> 00:03:43,194
- What makes you doubtful?
- Every doctor I've seen.

53
00:03:43,268 --> 00:03:46,897
Early disease left me
with a weakened heart.

54
00:03:46,972 --> 00:03:52,239
- Any illnesses that kept you out of school?
- I had typhoid fever and rickets.

55
00:03:52,344 --> 00:03:56,838
Also, rheumatic fever,
measles, chicken pox, pneumonia

56
00:03:56,915 --> 00:03:59,713
and several bouts of influenza.

57
00:04:03,989 --> 00:04:07,322
Pomeroy, what are you doing?
You're worse than Martin.

58
00:04:07,392 --> 00:04:10,759
- Never make judgments about people.
- I wasn't.

59
00:04:10,829 --> 00:04:16,790
Your body posture told me that my list
of ailments made you uncomfortable.

60
00:04:17,702 --> 00:04:20,671
Maybe it did. Sorry.

61
00:04:20,739 --> 00:04:25,073
Maintaining a nonjudgmental attitude
is harder than you think.

62
00:04:25,143 --> 00:04:31,673
The best way is to smile, nod your head,
while looking me directly in the eye.

63
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:33,741
Where were we?

64
00:04:33,819 --> 00:04:35,946
Your health as a boy.

65
00:04:36,021 --> 00:04:40,481
lt improved greatly when
I finally discovered the outdoors.

66
00:04:40,559 --> 00:04:43,756
I never got over the excitement
of setting off into the wild,

67
00:04:43,829 --> 00:04:47,663
escaping bed, illness, family.

68
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:50,895
Alone?

69
00:04:53,205 --> 00:04:56,732
No, no. Never alone.

70
00:04:56,808 --> 00:04:59,572
I was surrounded by friends.

71
00:05:01,413 --> 00:05:06,544
Being in the outdoors taught me
to rely on my own judgment.

72
00:05:14,693 --> 00:05:17,685
I started to learn about things
by grasping them,

73
00:05:17,762 --> 00:05:20,731
tasting them, looking at them.

74
00:05:20,799 --> 00:05:25,133
- Biology.
- Yes, biology.

75
00:05:25,237 --> 00:05:27,432
The science of life.

76
00:05:27,505 --> 00:05:33,239
Fields and woods became
my new place of worship, my cathedral.

77
00:05:38,483 --> 00:05:43,250
The only sadness they brought
was when I had to leave them.

78
00:05:45,223 --> 00:05:48,920
How old were you when you
first tried to pleasure yourself?

79
00:05:48,994 --> 00:05:51,588
No, no. No euphemisms.

80
00:05:51,663 --> 00:05:56,430
lf you're talking to a college graduate,
use masturbation, testicles, penis,

81
00:05:56,501 --> 00:05:58,992
vagina, vulva, urination, defecation.

82
00:05:59,237 --> 00:06:05,073
With the lower-level male,
it's jacking off, balls, prick, cunt, piss, shit.

83
00:06:05,176 --> 00:06:09,875
Gebhard, maybe your Harvard degree
is too ivory tower for our purposes.

84
00:06:09,948 --> 00:06:14,044
I was brought up out west. I've mixed
with ranchers, miners, my whole life.

85
00:06:14,152 --> 00:06:16,416
I thought you were gonna
shave that moustache.

86
00:06:16,488 --> 00:06:19,651
- I like it.
- It's a disguise, a cover-up.

87
00:06:19,724 --> 00:06:23,182
Look at any movie. The villain's
always the one with the moustache.

88
00:06:23,261 --> 00:06:24,558
My wife likes it.

89
00:06:24,629 --> 00:06:28,565
You have a chance to make an important
contribution to knowledge and science.

90
00:06:28,633 --> 00:06:31,500
Are you telling me you'd give that up
for a little facial hair?

91
00:06:31,569 --> 00:06:34,094
Yes, I suppose I am.

92
00:06:39,444 --> 00:06:42,504
Well... keep it trimmed.

93
00:06:44,816 --> 00:06:47,717
Let's get back to masturbation.

94
00:06:47,786 --> 00:06:50,653
That's a mating call.

95
00:06:57,095 --> 00:06:59,928
So how'd you wind up
at the Stevens lnstitute, Al?

96
00:06:59,998 --> 00:07:03,593
I thought you wanted to be a biologist.

97
00:07:03,868 --> 00:07:06,336
''There are enough scientists
in the world, son.''

98
00:07:06,404 --> 00:07:09,464
''Engineers are what society needs now.''

99
00:07:14,512 --> 00:07:16,104
l...

100
00:07:16,181 --> 00:07:18,911
I had one of the old fits again.

101
00:07:19,784 --> 00:07:21,217
I tried to stop it.

102
00:07:33,431 --> 00:07:38,767
''Any habit which causes the sex fluid
to be discharged must be resisted.''

103
00:07:39,904 --> 00:07:44,773
''Doctors link it to an assortment
of illnesses including insanity,

104
00:07:44,843 --> 00:07:49,246
blindness, epilepsy, even death.''

105
00:07:49,314 --> 00:07:52,511
What if it happens while you're asleep?

106
00:07:54,652 --> 00:08:00,648
''lt is said the loss of one ounce of
seminal fluid equals 40 ounces of blood.''

107
00:08:00,725 --> 00:08:04,456
I'm killing myself and I'm not even awake.

108
00:08:04,529 --> 00:08:06,929
What are we supposed to do?

109
00:08:09,234 --> 00:08:11,725
''Keep your bowels open.''

110
00:08:11,803 --> 00:08:14,533
''Read the Sermon on the Mount.''

111
00:08:14,806 --> 00:08:19,038
''Sit with your testicles submerged
in a bowl of cold water.''

112
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:21,772
''Think of your mother's pure love.''

113
00:08:24,816 --> 00:08:27,717
Why don't we pray?

114
00:09:07,092 --> 00:09:08,457
Keep firing questions.

115
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:11,723
Extreme rapidity makes it
difficult for a subject to lie.

116
00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:14,628
How young were you when you first
had an orgasm while dreaming?

117
00:09:14,699 --> 00:09:17,759
- How frequently did you have wet dreams?
- What did you dream about?

118
00:09:17,836 --> 00:09:20,862
How young were you when you
first experienced hugging or kissing?

119
00:09:20,939 --> 00:09:21,906
- Necking.
- Petting.

120
00:09:21,973 --> 00:09:22,803
Oral sex.

121
00:09:22,874 --> 00:09:26,310
How young were you when you no longer
thought of your parents' home as yours?

122
00:09:26,377 --> 00:09:28,208
Al?

123
00:09:28,279 --> 00:09:31,407
It's getting late.
Let's make our rounds.

124
00:09:33,451 --> 00:09:35,510
- Al!
- Be right down.

125
00:09:51,936 --> 00:09:53,801
Pack of Fatimas.

126
00:09:53,872 --> 00:09:57,638
OK, son. That'll be 15 cents.

127
00:10:01,579 --> 00:10:05,015
You're a criminal.
I shall report you to the local authorities.

128
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:07,013
Dear Jesus, a goddamn Protestant.

129
00:10:07,085 --> 00:10:11,545
- Did you sell this vile weed to a minor?
- What business is that of yours?

130
00:10:11,623 --> 00:10:14,956
lt is the Lord's work to protect
the young from temptation.

131
00:10:15,026 --> 00:10:18,826
- Men like you, sir...
- Get the hell out of my store!

132
00:10:18,897 --> 00:10:23,163
- ..are offensive to the great mass...
- Get the hell out of my store!

133
00:10:23,234 --> 00:10:25,634
Shut up! You know what you are, Father?

134
00:10:25,703 --> 00:10:27,432
- A prig.
- Al.

135
00:10:27,505 --> 00:10:30,736
A skinflint, a petty tyrant,
and a hypocrite to boot.

136
00:10:30,842 --> 00:10:34,505
You think you matter?
You don't matter.

137
00:10:34,579 --> 00:10:37,173
There's something wrong with him.
Come on, Al.

138
00:10:37,248 --> 00:10:38,306
No.

139
00:10:42,086 --> 00:10:46,216
Maybe your workload is too heavy.
You could drop mechanical drawing.

140
00:10:46,324 --> 00:10:48,792
I've withdrawn from Stevens.

141
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:52,455
That's impossible.
I'm a senior member of the faculty.

142
00:10:52,530 --> 00:10:56,432
- Someone would've informed me.
- Why? Everyone there hates you.

143
00:10:56,501 --> 00:11:00,028
I'm going to Bowdoin to study biology.

144
00:11:05,443 --> 00:11:10,574
- How do you intend to pay for that?
- They've given me a partial scholarship.

145
00:11:10,648 --> 00:11:14,607
And I've socked away
most of my Scouting money.

146
00:11:14,686 --> 00:11:19,089
You've become a shady person, Al.
A person who keeps secrets.

147
00:11:19,157 --> 00:11:21,091
I had no choice.

148
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:26,289
What a disappointment
you turned out to be.

149
00:11:28,266 --> 00:11:30,291
How many years of schooling
did you complete?

150
00:11:30,368 --> 00:11:33,496
20. After taking
my undergraduate degree at Bowdoin,

151
00:11:33,605 --> 00:11:36,597
I received my doctorate from
the Bussey lnstitute at Harvard.

152
00:11:36,674 --> 00:11:41,441
I took a position as assistant professor
of zoology here at Indiana University.

153
00:11:41,512 --> 00:11:46,211
At first I studied the Rhaetulus didieri,
or stag beetle.

154
00:11:46,451 --> 00:11:49,887
Then I discovered a far more
fascinating insect.

155
00:11:49,954 --> 00:11:54,152
This is the American Cynipidae,
or gall wasp.

156
00:11:55,493 --> 00:11:59,122
Here the wasp deposits an egg
into its host plant.

157
00:11:59,197 --> 00:12:01,062
ln this case, an oak tree.

158
00:12:02,433 --> 00:12:05,869
The adult wasp chews its way
through the tree,

159
00:12:05,937 --> 00:12:08,804
and copulates.

160
00:12:08,873 --> 00:12:13,242
At which point,
it has the good sense to die.

161
00:12:13,311 --> 00:12:18,305
The animal kingdom includes
at least two million insect species.

162
00:12:18,416 --> 00:12:22,352
So, what makes the gall wasp
so fascinating?

163
00:12:23,288 --> 00:12:26,724
I've spent the last three years
crisscrossing the continent,

164
00:12:26,791 --> 00:12:28,850
collecting gall wasps.

165
00:12:28,926 --> 00:12:32,760
What have I learned from my friends
half the size of the household ant?

166
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:35,424
That you need a date.

167
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:40,769
After studying thousands of these
pesky creatures under the microscope,

168
00:12:40,838 --> 00:12:44,296
I've yet to find a single gall wasp
that's the same as another.

169
00:12:44,375 --> 00:12:48,778
ln fact, some are so different
that the offspring of one generation

170
00:12:49,013 --> 00:12:53,450
bear no more resemblance to their parents
than a sheep bears to a goat!

171
00:12:53,518 --> 00:12:58,148
There are those of us
who might take comfort in this fact.

172
00:13:01,192 --> 00:13:03,888
Consider the implications.

173
00:13:03,961 --> 00:13:08,557
lf every single living thing is different
from every other living thing,

174
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:12,634
then diversity becomes
life's one irreducible fact.

175
00:13:12,704 --> 00:13:15,138
Only variations are real.

176
00:13:15,206 --> 00:13:20,439
And to see them,
you simply have to open your eyes.

177
00:13:23,448 --> 00:13:24,847
Good catch.

178
00:13:37,695 --> 00:13:40,186
Hello. Mind if I sit here?

179
00:13:41,899 --> 00:13:43,730
Why?

180
00:13:43,801 --> 00:13:49,068
Because you're the only unattached male
and I'm the only unattached female.

181
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:51,108
That's very sensible.

182
00:13:53,978 --> 00:13:56,538
A man who cooks - how refreshing.

183
00:13:56,781 --> 00:14:00,547
I picked it up when I went west to
collect galls. I was gone for 11 months.

184
00:14:00,618 --> 00:14:03,212
I don't think I saw more
than a dozen people.

185
00:14:03,287 --> 00:14:05,778
Sounds lonely.

186
00:14:05,857 --> 00:14:07,449
I enjoyed it.

187
00:14:09,026 --> 00:14:14,089
I've been reading up on gall wasps.
I think I know why they appeal to you.

188
00:14:14,165 --> 00:14:17,225
They have great big wings
but they can't fly.

189
00:14:17,301 --> 00:14:22,238
They're incapable of getting from this hill
to that unless it's close enough to walk,

190
00:14:22,306 --> 00:14:27,243
which means it's possible
to retrace each generation's steps,

191
00:14:27,311 --> 00:14:29,871
hill by hill by hill by hill,

192
00:14:29,947 --> 00:14:32,916
all the way back to the very beginning.

193
00:14:32,984 --> 00:14:37,080
- The gall wasp Garden of Eden.
- That's interesting, Miss Millen.

194
00:14:37,155 --> 00:14:42,889
You've bridged the gap between Darwin
and the Book of Genesis in a single phrase.

195
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,860
McMillen.

196
00:14:44,929 --> 00:14:47,124
Clara McMillen.

197
00:14:48,099 --> 00:14:50,329
- I'm Prok.
- Sorry?

198
00:14:50,401 --> 00:14:56,897
It's a nickname my graduate students
have given me. Pro-fessor K-insey. Prok.

199
00:14:56,974 --> 00:15:00,137
I worried it suggested
an inappropriate level of intimacy

200
00:15:00,378 --> 00:15:03,814
between teacher and student
that could lead to a loss of respect.

201
00:15:03,881 --> 00:15:06,145
I think itjust means they like you.

202
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:10,050
Yes. Eventually I realized that.

203
00:15:13,124 --> 00:15:16,116
- Tomato bisque and sandwiches?
- Please.

204
00:15:58,736 --> 00:16:01,170
- Such an impressive collection.
- Thanks.

205
00:16:01,239 --> 00:16:05,300
They used to be categorized by period.
Then I arranged them by composer.

206
00:16:05,376 --> 00:16:07,401
I find it's more efficient.

207
00:16:07,478 --> 00:16:11,972
Did you ever think about playing
professionally? You're very good!

208
00:16:12,049 --> 00:16:16,884
Thank you, but ''very good''
isn't good enough.

209
00:16:16,954 --> 00:16:18,922
I got you a present.

210
00:16:22,093 --> 00:16:23,355
Here.

211
00:16:33,571 --> 00:16:35,903
How marvelous.

212
00:16:35,973 --> 00:16:38,032
They're the right size.

213
00:16:57,395 --> 00:17:00,694
At what age did you first
have premarital intercourse?

214
00:17:00,765 --> 00:17:02,392
I didn't.

215
00:17:02,466 --> 00:17:06,027
- At the time of marriage, you were a virgin.
- Yes.

216
00:17:06,103 --> 00:17:08,765
- Was your spouse also a virgin?
- Yes.

217
00:17:08,839 --> 00:17:12,900
When you got married,
did you want to get married?

218
00:17:14,111 --> 00:17:15,408
Very much.

219
00:17:19,317 --> 00:17:22,684
I see marriage as a lifetime
partnership between equals.

220
00:17:22,753 --> 00:17:26,120
You're a brilliant scholar
with a keenly perceptive mind

221
00:17:26,357 --> 00:17:29,121
and a profound respect for nature.

222
00:17:29,193 --> 00:17:33,755
You're a capable hiker and camper,
and a champion swimmer.

223
00:17:33,831 --> 00:17:36,925
You're the one girl who's
as interested in insects as I am.

224
00:17:37,034 --> 00:17:41,596
To be honest, Prok... I'm just not sure.

225
00:17:41,672 --> 00:17:43,572
OK.

226
00:17:43,641 --> 00:17:45,802
- I consider myself a free thinker.
- Yes.

227
00:17:45,876 --> 00:17:49,243
Frankly, I find you a little churchy.

228
00:17:49,313 --> 00:17:53,909
- Churchy?
- And I've had another proposal.

229
00:17:53,985 --> 00:17:56,977
I'm not saying no.
I just need time.

230
00:18:00,291 --> 00:18:01,553
Prok...

231
00:18:01,792 --> 00:18:04,022
I think you're mean.

232
00:18:04,095 --> 00:18:07,087
Mean, heartless, and cold.

233
00:19:12,863 --> 00:19:15,024
Astounding.

234
00:19:33,584 --> 00:19:35,609
lf you'll have me.

235
00:19:55,573 --> 00:19:58,736
Gall wasp in amber.

236
00:19:58,843 --> 00:20:02,244
- How old is it?
- About 80 million years or so.

237
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:06,078
Does Mrs Kinsey like her wedding present?

238
00:20:06,183 --> 00:20:08,651
It's perfect.

239
00:20:47,792 --> 00:20:49,919
- I'm sorry.
- No, no, l...

240
00:20:58,736 --> 00:21:00,294
How beautiful.

241
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:04,637
May l?

242
00:21:29,667 --> 00:21:33,103
I'm sorry.
I'm a little nervous.

243
00:21:34,038 --> 00:21:36,404
- It's OK. We don't have to...
- No.

244
00:21:39,877 --> 00:21:41,606
I'm ready.

245
00:22:07,171 --> 00:22:09,196
Forgive me, Mac.

246
00:22:09,273 --> 00:22:12,640
No, I'm sorry.
It's just, it hurts too much.

247
00:22:26,891 --> 00:22:30,292
It's... it's a long drive to my parents'.

248
00:22:31,528 --> 00:22:33,689
We should get some sleep.

249
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:39,865
Robert's had a 92 in mechanical drawing.

250
00:22:39,937 --> 00:22:42,667
A 95 in mathematics, right?

251
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:46,938
And a clean 100 in shop practice.

252
00:22:47,011 --> 00:22:49,844
That's splendid, Robert.
Congratulations.

253
00:22:49,947 --> 00:22:54,316
I was worried his teachers were showing
him favor due to my senior position.

254
00:22:54,385 --> 00:22:57,582
But they tell me he is the most
gifted student in his class.

255
00:22:57,655 --> 00:23:01,056
Living with the best teacher
at Stevens doesn't hurt, Father.

256
00:23:01,125 --> 00:23:03,650
Please.

257
00:23:03,727 --> 00:23:09,131
No, at this rate he'll finish
his degree in... three years.

258
00:23:10,467 --> 00:23:13,197
Al, tell us what you've been working on.

259
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:17,371
- Well...
- Don't bother, Al.

260
00:23:17,441 --> 00:23:22,708
She won't be able to follow you.
She's only had a fourth-grade education.

261
00:23:25,549 --> 00:23:30,543
I'm studying gall wasps, Mom.
I've gathered over 100,000 specimens,

262
00:23:30,621 --> 00:23:33,988
which is really only a drop
in the bucket. But my aim is...

263
00:23:34,058 --> 00:23:39,189
Ten years of higher education
and he's still collecting bugs.

264
00:23:43,968 --> 00:23:47,665
Prok's also written a biology textbook.

265
00:23:47,738 --> 00:23:49,603
Really?

266
00:23:49,673 --> 00:23:52,904
It's read in colleges across the country.

267
00:23:52,977 --> 00:23:55,844
It's actually a very good read.

268
00:23:55,946 --> 00:23:59,040
So I assume you plan
to start a family soon?

269
00:24:00,851 --> 00:24:03,979
Oh, no. Don't rush it.
Once you have children,

270
00:24:04,088 --> 00:24:07,251
you're tied down forever.
Your life is over.

271
00:24:14,298 --> 00:24:15,856
What?

272
00:24:18,469 --> 00:24:22,963
I don't know what I expected,
but he's far worse than I ever imagined.

273
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:26,635
He is pretty awful, isn't he?

274
00:24:28,912 --> 00:24:31,005
''l once read...

275
00:24:33,017 --> 00:24:36,145
that the decline of the Roman Empire

276
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:39,383
was the result of too-frequent bathing!''

277
00:24:45,796 --> 00:24:52,861
''Some speculate that rampant adultery
is a possible cause of earthquakes.''

278
00:25:05,616 --> 00:25:08,346
I'm sorry you had to witness that.

279
00:25:11,355 --> 00:25:15,587
I think I really fell in love with you tonight.

280
00:25:17,227 --> 00:25:18,956
Seeing you here.

281
00:25:19,063 --> 00:25:21,793
Do you think we can make this work, Mac?

282
00:25:24,201 --> 00:25:26,260
I don't know.

283
00:25:28,572 --> 00:25:34,067
I've heard some people
just don't fit together.

284
00:25:36,547 --> 00:25:39,015
There's no one I'd rather be with.

285
00:25:40,284 --> 00:25:42,912
Physically, I mean.

286
00:25:46,023 --> 00:25:50,187
lf only there was a way to know.

287
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:51,727
That's it, Mac.

288
00:25:53,464 --> 00:25:55,989
Every problem has a solution,
even this one.

289
00:25:56,233 --> 00:25:59,999
We just need to talk to someone -
an expert who studied the matter.

290
00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:02,163
What are you doing?

291
00:26:02,272 --> 00:26:04,604
Why waste any more time?

292
00:26:04,708 --> 00:26:09,270
Your hymen shows
an inordinate thickness.

293
00:26:09,346 --> 00:26:12,645
Dr Kinsey... how large is your penis?

294
00:26:14,218 --> 00:26:17,745
- Excuse me?
- When erect, how large is it?

295
00:26:17,821 --> 00:26:21,484
How long from the scrotum? Here?

296
00:26:24,628 --> 00:26:27,028
Here?

297
00:26:28,866 --> 00:26:30,356
Here?

298
00:26:36,039 --> 00:26:39,065
I'm surprised you didn't pass out.

299
00:26:40,210 --> 00:26:43,737
- ls there anything we can do?
- It's a common problem.

300
00:26:43,847 --> 00:26:47,305
Would you like to take care of it today?

301
00:26:48,519 --> 00:26:50,487
Sure.

302
00:27:21,885 --> 00:27:25,343
God, God, God.

303
00:27:25,422 --> 00:27:29,688
The maximum frequency of intercourse
with your spouse in a seven-day period?

304
00:27:30,427 --> 00:27:32,827
I'd say 20 or so.

305
00:27:32,896 --> 00:27:37,026
At least three times a day the first week,
so 21 at a minimum.

306
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:38,727
ls there tongue kissing?

307
00:27:38,802 --> 00:27:40,599
- Yes.
- Yes.

308
00:27:40,671 --> 00:27:42,070
- Hand on breast?
- Yes.

309
00:27:42,139 --> 00:27:44,300
- Mouth?
- Hand on female genitalia?

310
00:27:44,374 --> 00:27:45,864
- Hand on penis?
- Yes.

311
00:27:45,943 --> 00:27:48,537
- Mouth on female genitalia?
- Mouth on penis?

312
00:27:48,612 --> 00:27:51,672
- Yes. Yes.
- Yes. Yes.

313
00:27:51,748 --> 00:27:54,478
- Yes.
- Yes.

314
00:27:54,551 --> 00:27:55,848
Yes, yes, yes.

315
00:27:55,919 --> 00:28:00,982
I became pregnant with Anne in 1923.
I decided to give up my graduate work.

316
00:28:01,058 --> 00:28:05,222
By the time Anne was born
I had collected over 200,000 gall wasps.

317
00:28:05,329 --> 00:28:07,160
Joan came along a year later.

318
00:28:07,231 --> 00:28:10,860
After Joan's fifth birthday,
I reached my goal of half a million wasps.

319
00:28:10,934 --> 00:28:12,834
And Bruce is our youngest.

320
00:28:12,903 --> 00:28:16,134
Bruce found the gall
that hatched the millionth wasp.

321
00:28:16,206 --> 00:28:20,870
- It was in mountains outside Mexico City.
- They grow up so fast.

322
00:28:21,311 --> 00:28:24,542
We just didn't know who to talk to,
Professor Kinsey.

323
00:28:24,615 --> 00:28:28,574
- What about your parents?
- I'd rather die.

324
00:28:28,652 --> 00:28:31,621
We heard you had good advice
for the biology students.

325
00:28:31,688 --> 00:28:35,180
Sexual difficulty among
newly married people is common.

326
00:28:35,259 --> 00:28:37,420
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

327
00:28:37,494 --> 00:28:40,190
- How long have you been married?
- Two months now.

328
00:28:40,264 --> 00:28:44,462
And Emily, you've had absolutely
no response during that time?

329
00:28:44,534 --> 00:28:46,525
It's like I'm dead down there.

330
00:28:46,603 --> 00:28:50,937
We went to the doctor,
and he said there's nothing wrong.

331
00:28:51,008 --> 00:28:53,704
Does Ben ever use
his fingers to excite you?

332
00:28:56,179 --> 00:28:58,079
Why bother?

333
00:28:58,148 --> 00:29:01,549
Now that we can do the real thing.

334
00:29:02,653 --> 00:29:06,350
What's your most common
sexual position?

335
00:29:06,456 --> 00:29:08,356
There's more than one?

336
00:29:08,425 --> 00:29:11,223
Mac and I are still discovering some.

337
00:29:12,763 --> 00:29:15,994
Were you sexually experienced
before you got married?

338
00:29:16,066 --> 00:29:17,863
No.

339
00:29:17,934 --> 00:29:21,734
I still thought babies
came out of women's navels.

340
00:29:23,774 --> 00:29:26,174
Did you ever masturbate?

341
00:29:28,111 --> 00:29:30,443
It's all my fault.

342
00:29:30,514 --> 00:29:32,709
I'm damaged in some way.

343
00:29:32,783 --> 00:29:35,445
I'm frigid.

344
00:29:35,519 --> 00:29:37,885
I don't think that's the problem at all.

345
00:29:37,954 --> 00:29:41,082
Ben, do you ever perform oral sex on Emily?

346
00:29:44,628 --> 00:29:49,224
- I don't know what that means, sir.
- Genital kissing.

347
00:29:55,772 --> 00:30:00,402
My brother told me that
that causes problems.

348
00:30:00,477 --> 00:30:03,640
Later on, with having babies.

349
00:30:03,714 --> 00:30:06,478
I don't think that's true.

350
00:30:06,550 --> 00:30:08,643
No, I heard that, too.

351
00:30:08,719 --> 00:30:12,746
I assure you, there's no relation
between oral sex and pregnancy.

352
00:30:12,823 --> 00:30:17,351
- But how do you know?
- How do I know the Earth is round?

353
00:30:17,427 --> 00:30:18,917
ltjust is.

354
00:30:19,763 --> 00:30:24,700
But has anyone actually proven
that there's no connection?

355
00:30:24,768 --> 00:30:28,465
lf you're asking whether there's been
a study devoted to the subject

356
00:30:28,538 --> 00:30:30,972
of oral copulation and fertility,

357
00:30:31,041 --> 00:30:36,741
well, frankly, I don't know.

358
00:30:38,148 --> 00:30:42,050
Well, then, how can you be sure?

359
00:30:43,987 --> 00:30:47,081
I felt like a blundering amateur.

360
00:30:47,157 --> 00:30:51,594
I couldn't imagine where this kid's crazy
idea came from until I discovered this.

361
00:30:51,661 --> 00:30:54,425
ldeal Marriage:
lts Physiology and Technique,

362
00:30:54,498 --> 00:30:55,590
Oh, dear.

363
00:30:55,665 --> 00:30:58,930
''Oral contact, while acceptable
as a means of stimulation,

364
00:30:59,002 --> 00:31:02,529
is pathological if carried through to orgasm,
and possibly injurious.''

365
00:31:02,773 --> 00:31:05,901
- I must be in grave danger, then.
- And wait.

366
00:31:05,976 --> 00:31:10,037
''The hands should never be used
for the purpose of sexual excitation.''

367
00:31:10,113 --> 00:31:13,947
''There is but one finger of love
with which to approach the female genitals,

368
00:31:14,017 --> 00:31:16,986
and that is the male organ.''

369
00:31:17,954 --> 00:31:20,047
It's all just hooey.

370
00:31:20,123 --> 00:31:22,318
Morality disguised as fact.

371
00:31:22,592 --> 00:31:25,493
Just do your tie.

372
00:31:25,962 --> 00:31:30,456
Professor Kinsey's methods
of collecting vast numbers of gall wasps

373
00:31:30,534 --> 00:31:35,733
over a wide geographic range
have made him a starred scientist.

374
00:31:36,406 --> 00:31:39,534
They have also earned him
his immortal nickname,

375
00:31:39,643 --> 00:31:41,668
''Get-a-Million Kinsey.''

376
00:31:41,745 --> 00:31:44,111
''Bore-a-Million Kinsey.''

377
00:31:45,182 --> 00:31:49,744
His new book,
The Origin of Higher Categories in,,,

378
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:51,549
Cynips? Cy-nips?

379
00:31:51,822 --> 00:31:53,050
Close enough.

380
00:31:53,123 --> 00:31:58,186
..traces the origin of the gall wasp back
to its birthplace in the Upper Cretaceous.

381
00:31:58,261 --> 00:32:02,755
So, now, I give you Dr Kinsey.

382
00:32:08,071 --> 00:32:13,373
Thank you, President Wells, for that
incisive description of 20 years of work.

383
00:32:13,443 --> 00:32:19,746
I thought you might've read my book
until I saw those crib notes in your palm.

384
00:32:19,916 --> 00:32:20,974
Crib notes.

385
00:32:21,051 --> 00:32:25,647
My other book on cynips hasn't been
checked out of the library in six years.

386
00:32:25,722 --> 00:32:29,055
I'd be surprised if
a dozen people have read it.

387
00:32:29,326 --> 00:32:33,558
But I guess I always knew
that gall wasps weren't going to...

388
00:32:35,098 --> 00:32:38,932
make them beat a path to my door.

389
00:32:43,373 --> 00:32:45,637
ln any case, thank you, Herman.

390
00:32:45,709 --> 00:32:50,339
This is splendid.
A really fine event, indeed.

391
00:32:50,413 --> 00:32:51,778
Thank you.

392
00:32:51,848 --> 00:32:54,373
Cheers, Prok. Congratulations.

393
00:32:54,451 --> 00:32:57,011
Here, here.

394
00:32:57,087 --> 00:33:00,955
Some reform-minded undergraduates
paid me a visit the other day, Thurman.

395
00:33:01,024 --> 00:33:06,018
- They're campaigning for a sex course.
- I covered sex in the hygiene class.

396
00:33:06,096 --> 00:33:08,997
Which the student paper called
''the most useless course.''

397
00:33:09,065 --> 00:33:13,729
Oh, Kinsey. I'm glad to see middle age
hasn't softened the edges. Mrs Kinsey.

398
00:33:13,803 --> 00:33:19,400
Not only is your class irrelevant,
it's irresponsible. There's a VD epidemic.

399
00:33:19,476 --> 00:33:22,934
That's my fault? I don't know
whether to be insulted or flattered.

400
00:33:23,013 --> 00:33:25,675
Besides, there's a cure for syphilis.

401
00:33:25,749 --> 00:33:29,185
- It's called ''abstinence.''
- Penicillin works just as well.

402
00:33:29,252 --> 00:33:33,120
Herman. The trustees appointed you
to shake things up around here.

403
00:33:33,189 --> 00:33:35,248
Why not address
the need for sex instruction

404
00:33:35,358 --> 00:33:38,486
that deals with
students' real questions, concerns?

405
00:33:38,595 --> 00:33:41,894
Open sex instruction
promotes daydreaming.

406
00:33:41,965 --> 00:33:45,992
lt is better to address these matters
in a general medical course.

407
00:33:46,069 --> 00:33:50,438
You mean an anti-sex course with
irrelevant gabble about dahlias and bees.

408
00:33:50,674 --> 00:33:55,077
Gentlemen, please. I'm going to take
the students' proposal under advisement.

409
00:33:55,145 --> 00:33:57,670
- Good.
- But since I just got this job,

410
00:33:57,747 --> 00:34:01,308
and wouldn't mind hanging on to it
for a couple of weeks,

411
00:34:01,418 --> 00:34:05,047
I think I'm gonna stick with
the hygiene course for now.

412
00:34:05,522 --> 00:34:09,083
Medical authorities state that,
of the type of teenage girls

413
00:34:09,159 --> 00:34:12,094
applying at public health stations for aid,

414
00:34:12,162 --> 00:34:17,464
the percentage that is infected with
venereal disease is always very high.

415
00:34:17,534 --> 00:34:23,598
ln all of these cases, where youthful energy
and inquisitiveness are unrestrained,

416
00:34:23,673 --> 00:34:26,437
the sex urge is always present.

417
00:34:26,509 --> 00:34:31,970
And promiscuity nearly always follows,
with its inevitable harvest of abortions,

418
00:34:32,048 --> 00:34:36,542
illegitimate births and... disease.

419
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:41,455
- What's your trouble, Jerry?
- Well, I've got a bad sore down here.

420
00:34:41,524 --> 00:34:44,152
Stretch out on that table.
We'll have a look.

421
00:34:44,227 --> 00:34:48,755
This story vividly portrays
the misery caused to innocent victims

422
00:34:48,832 --> 00:34:54,771
by the ignorance or selfishness
of individuals infected with syphilis.

423
00:34:54,838 --> 00:34:59,639
You can't tell by the looks
of a woman whether she has syphilis.

424
00:34:59,709 --> 00:35:04,237
That finishes me. I'll have to go someplace
where people don't know who I am.

425
00:35:04,314 --> 00:35:07,408
The cure forjuvenile delinquency

426
00:35:07,484 --> 00:35:10,146
is an education
in the dangers and consequences

427
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:16,420
of breaking the time-tested rules laid down
for the regulation of human conduct.

428
00:35:19,295 --> 00:35:23,891
The idea that men need sex is a lie.

429
00:35:25,268 --> 00:35:30,433
lf it were true, the boy who exercises
his sex organs regularly

430
00:35:30,507 --> 00:35:35,274
would achieve the greatest
sexual experiences in later life.

431
00:35:35,345 --> 00:35:40,305
Whereas, in fact, that boy
is likely to be sexually dead

432
00:35:40,383 --> 00:35:43,910
by the time he reaches adulthood.

433
00:35:43,987 --> 00:35:49,050
Abstinence poses no difficulty
for the college-age male.

434
00:35:49,125 --> 00:35:53,653
Men don't reach their sexual peak
until the age of 40.

435
00:35:53,730 --> 00:35:57,461
lt is the lower-class male, often Negro,

436
00:35:57,534 --> 00:36:01,664
who finds it difficult to control his urges.

437
00:36:02,205 --> 00:36:05,174
However, perfect inhibition,

438
00:36:05,275 --> 00:36:09,541
although an ideal to be striven for,
is not always achievable.

439
00:36:09,612 --> 00:36:12,911
Stress, and the worries of the day,

440
00:36:12,982 --> 00:36:16,042
can lead to a weakening of resolve,

441
00:36:16,119 --> 00:36:19,316
opening the door to temptation.

442
00:36:21,257 --> 00:36:23,987
When tense at bedtime...

443
00:36:24,994 --> 00:36:28,521
I find there are little tricks to relaxing.

444
00:36:28,598 --> 00:36:32,728
lf I can't get to sleep,
I like to close my eyes...

445
00:36:33,470 --> 00:36:35,904
and think of all the Johns I know.

446
00:36:39,876 --> 00:36:42,811
Well, not only Johns.

447
00:36:42,879 --> 00:36:45,473
Sometimes Peters.

448
00:36:45,548 --> 00:36:48,449
How about Dicks?

449
00:36:48,518 --> 00:36:49,985
I'm sorry?

450
00:36:51,888 --> 00:36:56,018
lf you're here for Dr Kinsey's class, it's only
open to faculty members and their wives,

451
00:36:56,259 --> 00:37:01,196
graduate students, seniors
and married undergraduates.

452
00:37:01,431 --> 00:37:04,559
Come back and try in the spring.

453
00:37:04,634 --> 00:37:07,467
- Are you a senior?
- We're engaged.

454
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:12,631
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

455
00:37:16,679 --> 00:37:22,117
Why offer a marriage course?
Because society has interfered

456
00:37:22,352 --> 00:37:25,583
with what should be a normal,
biological development,

457
00:37:25,655 --> 00:37:29,056
causing a scandalous delay
of sexual activity.

458
00:37:29,125 --> 00:37:32,094
Which leads to sexual difficulty
in early marriage.

459
00:37:32,162 --> 00:37:36,531
ln an uninhibited society, a 12-year-old
would know most of the biology

460
00:37:36,599 --> 00:37:39,227
which I will have to give you
in formal lectures.

461
00:37:39,302 --> 00:37:44,330
So, let's start with the six stages
of the coital sequence.

462
00:37:44,407 --> 00:37:46,807
Stimulation,

463
00:37:46,876 --> 00:37:50,209
lubrication, erection,

464
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:53,313
increased sensitivity,

465
00:37:53,550 --> 00:37:56,451
orgasm and nervous release.

466
00:37:56,686 --> 00:38:01,020
Both sexes experience
all six stages equally.

467
00:38:06,095 --> 00:38:10,532
Stim-u-lation.

468
00:38:11,701 --> 00:38:17,640
Who can tell me which part
of the human body can enlarge 100 times?

469
00:38:19,943 --> 00:38:21,376
Miss.

470
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:25,438
I'm sure I don't know.

471
00:38:25,515 --> 00:38:28,609
You've no right to ask me
such a question in a mixed class.

472
00:38:28,718 --> 00:38:33,951
I was referring to the pupil
of your eye, young lady.

473
00:38:34,023 --> 00:38:38,858
And I think I should tell you,
you're in for a terrible disappointment.

474
00:38:40,930 --> 00:38:45,799
lt is often with the eye
that stimulation begins.

475
00:38:52,175 --> 00:38:55,702
The adjustments which are made
in the male and female genitalia

476
00:38:55,778 --> 00:38:58,576
are shown on this slide.

477
00:38:58,648 --> 00:39:03,517
The vagina must be spread open
as the erect male organ penetrates.

478
00:39:05,054 --> 00:39:08,114
You will see that the clitoris is swollen,

479
00:39:08,191 --> 00:39:12,355
providing the erotic stimulation
necessary for the completion of the act

480
00:39:12,428 --> 00:39:15,295
on the part of the female.

481
00:39:16,332 --> 00:39:19,358
You will also see
that this point on the penis,

482
00:39:19,435 --> 00:39:21,801
which is one of the most sensitive points,

483
00:39:21,871 --> 00:39:23,805
is similarly stimulated.

484
00:39:29,946 --> 00:39:32,847
Where on earth did you get that cap?

485
00:39:32,916 --> 00:39:35,146
Oh, Professor Kinsey. I'm sorry.

486
00:39:35,218 --> 00:39:40,212
It's a whaler's hat. Not very pretty,
but extremely practical in a storm.

487
00:39:40,290 --> 00:39:43,487
- Do I know you?
- I'm in your marriage course. Clyde Martin.

488
00:39:43,559 --> 00:39:45,720
How are you finding it, Mr Martin?

489
00:39:45,795 --> 00:39:48,821
It's the most enlightening class
I've ever taken.

490
00:39:48,898 --> 00:39:52,664
I better get going. I've got ajob interview
at the zoology department.

491
00:39:52,735 --> 00:39:55,533
Forget that. Come with me.

492
00:39:56,105 --> 00:39:57,697
All right.

493
00:40:00,310 --> 00:40:04,246
Dr Kinsey will be staying late.
He'll get to all of you.

494
00:40:04,314 --> 00:40:06,111
Can too much sex cause cancer?

495
00:40:06,182 --> 00:40:10,175
- Will wearing high heels make me sterile?
- I think my vagina's abnormally shaped.

496
00:40:10,253 --> 00:40:14,713
- Can you get syphilis from a whistle?
- ls homosexuality a form of insanity?

497
00:40:14,791 --> 00:40:19,694
I think about my cat... a lot.

498
00:40:19,762 --> 00:40:25,564
Does suppressing sex
lead to stuttering?

499
00:40:25,802 --> 00:40:28,270
''ls my penis smaller than most?''

500
00:40:28,338 --> 00:40:32,707
''Does too much masturbation
cause premature ejaculation?''

501
00:40:32,775 --> 00:40:36,643
''ls it unusual for my boyfriend
to touch my anus?''

502
00:40:36,713 --> 00:40:39,443
All excellent questions.

503
00:40:39,515 --> 00:40:45,283
And they all have the same answer:
I don't know.

504
00:40:45,355 --> 00:40:48,722
From a sexual standpoint,
it's hard to say what's common or rare

505
00:40:48,791 --> 00:40:51,954
because we know so little
about what people actually do.

506
00:40:52,028 --> 00:40:56,465
This leaves most of us
feeling anxious or guilty.

507
00:40:56,532 --> 00:41:02,266
''Am I interested in the right things?''
''Do I do things the normal way?''

508
00:41:02,338 --> 00:41:06,968
One of the ways of finding out what people do
is to find out what they've done.

509
00:41:07,043 --> 00:41:12,037
So, please, take the time to fill out
these sex questionnaires.

510
00:41:12,115 --> 00:41:16,415
Try to be as accurate and honest
as you possibly can.

511
00:41:16,486 --> 00:41:18,613
This will only work...
Pass that down.

512
00:41:18,688 --> 00:41:21,316
This will only work if you tell the truth.

513
00:41:21,391 --> 00:41:24,827
Dr Kinsey, this is really amazing.

514
00:41:24,894 --> 00:41:27,454
These colors are incredible.

515
00:41:27,530 --> 00:41:31,296
It's the most complete collection
east of the Mississippi.

516
00:41:31,534 --> 00:41:35,300
We have over 250
separate varieties of irises.

517
00:41:36,439 --> 00:41:40,933
Good work, Martin,
but you're using the wrong muscle group.

518
00:41:43,246 --> 00:41:46,579
Come on. Here, bend the legs.
Use the thighs.

519
00:41:46,649 --> 00:41:50,415
The arms should only be used to guide.
No, you do it.

520
00:41:50,486 --> 00:41:52,010
Guide...

521
00:41:54,791 --> 00:41:57,089
Lemonade.

522
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:59,993
Mac, these responses will floor you.

523
00:42:00,063 --> 00:42:04,227
The gap between what we assume people do
and what they actually do is enormous.

524
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:07,792
What amazes me is there's no relation
between how sexy a girl looks

525
00:42:08,071 --> 00:42:09,766
and her sex life.

526
00:42:09,839 --> 00:42:12,364
The ugly ones seem to get all the action.

527
00:42:12,442 --> 00:42:15,343
I always thought ''ugly'' was an ugly word.

528
00:42:15,411 --> 00:42:16,878
Sorry.

529
00:42:18,815 --> 00:42:23,013
Not only does every male have a history
of masturbation. Most of the women do.

530
00:42:23,086 --> 00:42:26,522
That doesn't surprise me.
What about premarital sex?

531
00:42:26,622 --> 00:42:29,716
About a third of the married men
claim at least one experience.

532
00:42:29,992 --> 00:42:33,223
- Only one in ten for the women.
- lf they're telling the truth.

533
00:42:33,296 --> 00:42:35,958
And there's extramarital sex, too.

534
00:42:36,199 --> 00:42:39,430
Notjust heterosexual, but homosexual.

535
00:42:39,502 --> 00:42:44,098
I just wish we could get more volunteers.
100 cases is hardly representative.

536
00:42:44,173 --> 00:42:48,200
Maybe it's because it's a questionnaire.
Feels too much like a test.

537
00:42:48,277 --> 00:42:52,008
I agree. Also, people don't
know if they can trust you.

538
00:42:52,081 --> 00:42:54,049
They have to be sure their secrets are safe.

539
00:42:54,117 --> 00:42:58,247
That's ridiculous. Everyone knows I keep
those questionnaires under lock and key.

540
00:42:58,321 --> 00:43:02,724
Clyde has a point.
You're asking people to reveal information

541
00:43:02,792 --> 00:43:07,525
that's very sensitive,
possibly even damaging.

542
00:43:07,597 --> 00:43:13,160
What if you just talk to them?
Then all their secrets would be in your head.

543
00:43:17,406 --> 00:43:21,035
Martin, you should have
spoken up months ago.

544
00:43:23,246 --> 00:43:28,513
- I can't tell. Was that a compliment?
- Yes, I think it was.

545
00:43:28,818 --> 00:43:32,117
People resist, but I'm trying
to choreograph the questions

546
00:43:32,188 --> 00:43:34,088
so they'll be disarmed into answering.

547
00:43:34,157 --> 00:43:37,854
- How many things did you put in there?
- It's the Kinsey stew.

548
00:43:37,927 --> 00:43:41,294
- ''Clean out the refrigerator night.''
- Martin's been helpful.

549
00:43:41,364 --> 00:43:46,165
He's an ideal practice subject since
he's had relations with both men and women.

550
00:43:46,235 --> 00:43:48,362
- Where have you been?
- Swim practice.

551
00:43:48,437 --> 00:43:50,234
- How'd it go?
- Pretty good.

552
00:43:50,306 --> 00:43:52,797
- Coach might start me at the next meet.
- That's wonderful.

553
00:43:52,875 --> 00:43:56,504
There won't be any swimming
unless your science grades improve.

554
00:43:56,579 --> 00:44:00,948
- I hate biology.
- Because you never developed your intellect.

555
00:44:01,017 --> 00:44:05,454
Physical activity is important, son,
but your interest in sports is excessive.

556
00:44:05,521 --> 00:44:10,117
Yes. Maybe he should
take up engineering instead.

557
00:44:10,193 --> 00:44:13,594
The one-on-one is turning
out to be so elastic.

558
00:44:13,663 --> 00:44:16,461
Talking yields more information
than I imagined.

559
00:44:16,532 --> 00:44:19,023
lt'll prove to be
a groundbreaking technique.

560
00:44:19,135 --> 00:44:22,002
What if they make things up?
That's what I'd do.

561
00:44:22,071 --> 00:44:25,871
I'm building in little tripwires
to catch lies and inconsistencies.

562
00:44:25,942 --> 00:44:30,606
- Would you like to take my sex history?
- Do you have a sex history, sweetie?

563
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:32,739
- No.
- What about you, Anne?

564
00:44:33,015 --> 00:44:36,678
- You've been dating Jim for a while now.
- We've done some petting.

565
00:44:36,752 --> 00:44:39,619
I figured we wouldn't try
intercourse until college.

566
00:44:39,689 --> 00:44:42,055
That's probably better.

567
00:44:42,124 --> 00:44:44,684
lf Anne can have intercourse,
I should be able to.

568
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:48,196
Your sister's 18
and seriously involved with someone.

569
00:44:48,264 --> 00:44:50,425
Does it hurt?

570
00:44:50,499 --> 00:44:53,093
- What, dear?
- Breaking the hymen.

571
00:44:58,074 --> 00:45:00,770
Just a little.
It's nothing too bad.

572
00:45:00,843 --> 00:45:04,643
lt helps if you spread the vulva
to facilitate penetration.

573
00:45:04,747 --> 00:45:07,716
Can we please talk about
something else for once?

574
00:45:07,783 --> 00:45:10,479
Other families don't do this.
lt isn't normal.

575
00:45:10,553 --> 00:45:13,078
When did you become such a prig?

576
00:45:13,155 --> 00:45:16,318
My friends aren't allowed here.
Their parents think you're a menace.

577
00:45:16,392 --> 00:45:20,488
You spend too much time in the water.
Chlorine's done something to your brain!

578
00:45:20,563 --> 00:45:23,327
- Have you learned nothing?
- I don't know where he came from.

579
00:45:23,399 --> 00:45:24,764
Nothing.

580
00:45:26,569 --> 00:45:30,061
- Bruce? Bruce.
- I don't want to talk about it.

581
00:45:30,306 --> 00:45:33,639
- I just want him to get off my back.
- Bruce...

582
00:45:35,845 --> 00:45:38,871
I heard about this community
from a former student.

583
00:45:38,981 --> 00:45:42,314
This is my third trip.
The results have been astounding.

584
00:45:42,385 --> 00:45:46,344
By my calculation, there are over
300,000 cases here in Chicago.

585
00:45:46,422 --> 00:45:48,822
No one's bothered
to talk to them before.

586
00:45:48,891 --> 00:45:52,884
It's a gold mine of information, Martin.
We've got it all to ourselves.

587
00:46:02,805 --> 00:46:06,400
- What'll it be, handsome?
- Two Scotches.

588
00:46:07,510 --> 00:46:10,707
I find liquor is an essential tool
for social lubrication.

589
00:46:10,946 --> 00:46:17,317
Although it does involve more drinking
than I thought I would ever do in a lifetime.

590
00:46:17,386 --> 00:46:19,445
Let's get started.

591
00:46:21,157 --> 00:46:24,752
Hello, I'm Professor Kinsey
from Indiana University.

592
00:46:24,827 --> 00:46:28,991
And I'm making a study of sex behavior.
Can we sit and talk?

593
00:46:29,065 --> 00:46:32,091
- I assume you're joking.
- No, I'm not.

594
00:46:32,168 --> 00:46:36,832
I'd be grateful if you'd answer
some questions about your sexual history.

595
00:46:37,073 --> 00:46:41,601
Mary here is a professor. She says
she wants to study my sex behavior.

596
00:46:41,711 --> 00:46:44,407
Well, tell her to stick around and watch.

597
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:47,540
Come on. Andy's here.
You have to see what he's wearing.

598
00:46:47,616 --> 00:46:50,210
I can't wait.

599
00:46:50,286 --> 00:46:52,413
Andy.

600
00:46:52,488 --> 00:46:55,457
Hello, I'm Professor Kinsey from...

601
00:46:55,558 --> 00:46:59,050
Excuse me, I'm Professor Kinsey.
Excuse me.

602
00:46:59,128 --> 00:47:02,154
Hello, I'm Professor Kinsey
from Indiana University.

603
00:47:02,231 --> 00:47:05,667
I'm making a study of sex behavior.
Can I ask you a few questions?

604
00:47:05,735 --> 00:47:08,898
I've heard about you.
You're the sex doctor, right?

605
00:47:08,971 --> 00:47:12,168
I guess I am. lf you'd be
kind enough to talk to me,

606
00:47:12,241 --> 00:47:15,039
it would be of great help to science.

607
00:47:15,144 --> 00:47:17,442
Sure. What do you want to know?

608
00:47:17,713 --> 00:47:21,012
..same boy, Tommy Potts.

609
00:47:21,083 --> 00:47:24,246
We were messing around in a haystack.

610
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:27,153
You know, like kids will do.

611
00:47:28,724 --> 00:47:30,817
Pop walked in.

612
00:47:32,461 --> 00:47:34,929
Found us, locked us in the barn.

613
00:47:35,931 --> 00:47:38,832
Called my brothers in.

614
00:47:39,735 --> 00:47:41,327
They...

615
00:47:43,339 --> 00:47:45,603
They branded us.

616
00:47:53,816 --> 00:47:55,909
Took turns doing it.

617
00:47:57,653 --> 00:47:59,985
Then they beat us raw.

618
00:48:00,055 --> 00:48:04,014
Broke a couple of ribs.
Collarbone.

619
00:48:04,093 --> 00:48:06,687
Tommy, he...

620
00:48:07,863 --> 00:48:10,423
He didn't make out as well as I did.

621
00:48:13,969 --> 00:48:16,870
- What age were you?
- 13.

622
00:48:17,139 --> 00:48:20,973
- And you've been on your own since then?
- I get by.

623
00:48:24,847 --> 00:48:27,782
It's not that I mind being queer.

624
00:48:27,850 --> 00:48:30,148
'Cause I don't.

625
00:48:30,219 --> 00:48:33,245
It's just...

626
00:48:33,355 --> 00:48:36,415
I wish other folks weren't so put out by it.

627
00:48:36,492 --> 00:48:41,555
Homosexuality happens to be
out of fashion in society now.

628
00:48:41,630 --> 00:48:44,224
That doesn't mean
it won't change someday.

629
00:48:44,300 --> 00:48:45,927
Right.

630
00:48:54,710 --> 00:48:57,042
But why didn't I see it before?

631
00:48:57,112 --> 00:49:00,445
Human beings are just bigger,
more complicated gall wasps.

632
00:49:00,516 --> 00:49:02,984
All I have to do is collect
more than anyone else.

633
00:49:03,052 --> 00:49:07,113
Homosexuals are the perfect place to start.

634
00:49:07,189 --> 00:49:08,747
- What?
- I'm sorry.

635
00:49:08,824 --> 00:49:11,520
I had an image of our friends
hearing you now.

636
00:49:11,627 --> 00:49:13,925
As if the marriage course
isn't bad enough.

637
00:49:13,996 --> 00:49:19,263
Now, Prok, promise me, you'll get
four hours' sleep before heading back.

638
00:49:19,335 --> 00:49:23,237
- Of course.
- And let Clyde share in the driving.

639
00:49:25,207 --> 00:49:27,004
Prok?

640
00:49:27,109 --> 00:49:29,168
OK, Mac.

641
00:49:29,245 --> 00:49:32,442
I'll sign off now.

642
00:49:32,515 --> 00:49:33,777
I love you.

643
00:49:33,849 --> 00:49:35,908
Love you, too.

644
00:49:46,996 --> 00:49:50,625
You know what impressed me tonight?

645
00:49:50,699 --> 00:49:53,532
ls the way that you talk to people.

646
00:49:53,602 --> 00:49:55,866
You can getjust about
anybody to open up.

647
00:49:57,773 --> 00:50:01,174
It's just a matter of putting
yourself on their level.

648
00:50:01,443 --> 00:50:03,536
No, it's more than that.

649
00:50:03,612 --> 00:50:05,580
You really seem to care.

650
00:50:16,625 --> 00:50:19,458
This rating scale of yours?

651
00:50:19,528 --> 00:50:22,463
Zero to six?

652
00:50:22,565 --> 00:50:25,398
Zero being exclusively heterosexual

653
00:50:25,467 --> 00:50:30,666
and... six being exclusively homosexual.

654
00:50:30,739 --> 00:50:33,003
A great many people line up in the middle.

655
00:50:33,108 --> 00:50:36,407
- What makes you think that's true?
- Common sense.

656
00:50:36,478 --> 00:50:39,936
Remember, about a third
of our heterosexual histories

657
00:50:40,015 --> 00:50:42,609
have homosexual acts, and vice-versa.

658
00:50:42,685 --> 00:50:45,245
Right.

659
00:50:45,354 --> 00:50:48,084
I guess I'm about a ''three.''

660
00:50:48,324 --> 00:50:53,956
Based on your sexual history,
I'd say that's... right.

661
00:50:54,029 --> 00:50:55,189
How about you?

662
00:50:59,134 --> 00:51:05,369
I suppose I've been a ''one'' or ''two''...
most of my life,

663
00:51:05,441 --> 00:51:10,606
even though it's taken
a long time to... recognize it.

664
00:51:12,281 --> 00:51:14,476
And now?

665
00:51:19,054 --> 00:51:21,648
Probably...

666
00:51:24,159 --> 00:51:25,387
''three.''

667
00:51:25,461 --> 00:51:28,294
Have you ever done anything about it?

668
00:51:34,336 --> 00:51:36,395
Would you like to?

669
00:52:08,003 --> 00:52:11,131
I've taken on so many
other people's secrets.

670
00:52:11,206 --> 00:52:15,108
I don't want any of my own,
and certainly not with you.

671
00:52:16,512 --> 00:52:20,278
You still haven't said anything.

672
00:52:21,350 --> 00:52:25,878
It's not like I'm surprised, exactly.

673
00:52:26,722 --> 00:52:31,022
I've observed...
certain things over the years.

674
00:52:31,093 --> 00:52:35,154
- Such as?
- A look or a gesture.

675
00:52:37,132 --> 00:52:40,226
The pet student who suddenly
becomes a member of the family,

676
00:52:40,302 --> 00:52:43,601
then just as suddenly disappears
when you tire of him.

677
00:52:43,672 --> 00:52:45,936
You must know me better
than I know myself.

678
00:52:46,175 --> 00:52:51,010
I'm not sure I understand.

679
00:52:52,481 --> 00:52:55,314
Haven't I always been open
to whatever you wanted?

680
00:52:55,551 --> 00:52:59,817
It's not you, Mac.
You're the best partner any man could have.

681
00:52:59,888 --> 00:53:02,516
I'm just not enough. ls that it?

682
00:53:06,795 --> 00:53:11,357
Please, Mac. This is inside of me.
To what extent, I don't know.

683
00:53:11,433 --> 00:53:15,335
But I'd be a hypocrite
if I pretended it wasn't there.

684
00:53:15,404 --> 00:53:19,272
- You said you had feelings for other men...
- Don't use that against me.

685
00:53:19,541 --> 00:53:22,908
I'm sorry, but what keeps you
from acting on your feelings?

686
00:53:22,978 --> 00:53:26,277
- Convention.
- No. It's our marriage.

687
00:53:26,348 --> 00:53:30,512
- It's our children.
- Exactly. Social restraints.

688
00:53:32,121 --> 00:53:35,352
Did you ever think that perhaps
those restraints are there

689
00:53:35,424 --> 00:53:39,326
to keep people from hurting each other?

690
00:53:39,394 --> 00:53:44,798
I don't sleep with other men because
I love you, and I don't want to hurt you.

691
00:53:44,867 --> 00:53:49,270
- But what if it didn't hurt me?
- Then I'd be hurt.

692
00:53:49,338 --> 00:53:53,399
You're afraid I won't love you anymore,
which is impossible, Mac.

693
00:53:53,475 --> 00:53:57,104
The human animal is capable
of all kinds of sexual expression.

694
00:53:57,179 --> 00:54:00,910
Not all sex has to be sanctioned by love,
enriched by emotion...

695
00:54:00,983 --> 00:54:02,848
Stop.

696
00:54:02,918 --> 00:54:05,614
Stop lecturing, Prok.

697
00:54:05,687 --> 00:54:09,589
Stop using science
to justify what you've done.

698
00:54:11,927 --> 00:54:14,191
Oh, Mac.

699
00:54:14,263 --> 00:54:16,629
Mac.

700
00:54:16,865 --> 00:54:18,560
Listen to me.

701
00:54:18,634 --> 00:54:22,400
You're my girl.
You always will be.

702
00:54:22,471 --> 00:54:28,068
The bond we have, the life we share -
sex is nothing compared to that.

703
00:54:30,112 --> 00:54:33,013
I can't talk about this any more.

704
00:54:54,937 --> 00:54:59,271
Most people think that what
they do sexually is what everyone does.

705
00:54:59,341 --> 00:55:01,468
Or should do.

706
00:55:01,710 --> 00:55:06,147
But I might remark that nearly
all the so-called sexual perversions

707
00:55:06,215 --> 00:55:09,514
fall within the range of biologic normality.

708
00:55:09,585 --> 00:55:12,486
For example, masturbation,

709
00:55:12,554 --> 00:55:15,819
mouth-genital contacts
and homosexual acts

710
00:55:15,924 --> 00:55:20,156
are common among most mammals,
including humans.

711
00:55:20,229 --> 00:55:24,222
Society might condemn
such practices on moral grounds.

712
00:55:24,299 --> 00:55:29,168
However, it's ludicrous
to call them ''unnatural.''

713
00:55:29,238 --> 00:55:33,504
But based on the first book of Genesis,
and according to public opinion,

714
00:55:33,575 --> 00:55:36,772
there's only one correct sexual equation:

715
00:55:36,845 --> 00:55:39,279
man plus woman equals baby.

716
00:55:39,348 --> 00:55:41,612
Everything else is vice.

717
00:55:41,683 --> 00:55:44,914
But the orgasm record of the males
in this classroom alone

718
00:55:44,987 --> 00:55:47,979
proves the ineffectiveness
of social restrictions

719
00:55:48,056 --> 00:55:51,787
and the imperativeness
of the biologic demand.

720
00:55:56,365 --> 00:56:03,294
Why are some cows highly sexed,
while others just stand there?

721
00:56:03,372 --> 00:56:08,241
Why do some men need 30 orgasms
a week, and others almost none?

722
00:56:12,748 --> 00:56:16,343
Because everyone is different.

723
00:56:17,019 --> 00:56:21,285
The problem is,
most people want to be the same.

724
00:56:21,356 --> 00:56:23,722
They find it easier to simply ignore

725
00:56:23,792 --> 00:56:28,491
this fundamental aspect
of the human condition.

726
00:56:28,563 --> 00:56:31,657
They are so eager to be part of the group,

727
00:56:31,733 --> 00:56:35,225
they'll betray their
own nature to get there.

728
00:56:36,838 --> 00:56:41,070
lf something pleasurable
and strongly desired is prohibited,

729
00:56:41,143 --> 00:56:44,579
it becomes an obsession.

730
00:56:46,548 --> 00:56:48,140
Think about this.

731
00:57:03,765 --> 00:57:07,531
You have better things to do than help
a middle-aged woman with her groceries.

732
00:57:07,602 --> 00:57:11,663
Prok got worried when
he couldn't reach you.

733
00:57:11,740 --> 00:57:15,198
Said he had to take histories
later this evening, so...

734
00:57:15,277 --> 00:57:18,610
''He'd like an early dinner,
preferably five o'clock.''

735
00:57:18,680 --> 00:57:20,807
Hardly gives me time to boil an egg.

736
00:57:20,882 --> 00:57:24,045
- Can I help?
- No, I'll manage. I just...

737
00:57:24,119 --> 00:57:28,954
- I'm sorry he made you play messenger.
- No, I volunteered.

738
00:57:35,530 --> 00:57:37,293
Hear that?

739
00:57:37,366 --> 00:57:41,462
- What?
- Sound of an empty nest.

740
00:57:43,572 --> 00:57:46,666
Must be a big adjustment.
Have you heard from Bruce yet?

741
00:57:46,742 --> 00:57:52,339
No. He's loving college.
Maybe it's just being away from here.

742
00:57:52,414 --> 00:57:55,542
- Would you like a piece of pie?
- Rhubarb?

743
00:57:55,817 --> 00:57:57,682
Have a seat.

744
00:58:02,657 --> 00:58:04,318
You know, Clyde...

745
00:58:04,393 --> 00:58:07,089
I didn't like you very much at first.

746
00:58:07,329 --> 00:58:09,388
I don't blame you.

747
00:58:09,498 --> 00:58:13,127
- Most women would've had me murdered.
- I considered it.

748
00:58:13,201 --> 00:58:16,432
I hate to think of myself as conventional.

749
00:58:16,671 --> 00:58:20,107
But, if this had to happen,

750
00:58:21,309 --> 00:58:23,743
I'm glad it was you.

751
00:58:23,912 --> 00:58:28,872
And, I have to admit,
there have been some benefits.

752
00:58:29,151 --> 00:58:32,678
lt certainly sparked things up sexually.

753
00:58:32,754 --> 00:58:37,623
I suppose we'd both grown bored
without even realizing it.

754
00:58:37,692 --> 00:58:40,286
I think you've handled it remarkably well.

755
00:58:40,362 --> 00:58:42,387
I learned something a long time ago:

756
00:58:42,464 --> 00:58:46,230
once Prok has his mind set,
it's no use trying to stop him.

757
00:58:46,301 --> 00:58:48,496
Yes.

758
00:58:48,603 --> 00:58:51,663
He is...

759
00:58:52,707 --> 00:58:54,402
relentless.

760
00:58:57,112 --> 00:58:58,875
Clyde.

761
00:59:01,249 --> 00:59:06,084
You know, this thing between Prok and me,

762
00:59:06,154 --> 00:59:09,885
it was fine for a while, but...

763
00:59:09,958 --> 00:59:13,621
I guess I just really miss
sleeping with women.

764
00:59:20,535 --> 00:59:23,663
That's perfectly understandable.

765
00:59:30,045 --> 00:59:35,210
It's clear from your history you have
a greater sexual in interest in women.

766
00:59:35,283 --> 00:59:39,811
Good. Then you won't mind if
I ask Mac to have sex with me.

767
00:59:41,690 --> 00:59:44,682
Only if it appeals to you, of course.

768
00:59:46,795 --> 00:59:51,323
- Would it be separately or together?
- Definitely just you and l.

769
00:59:51,566 --> 00:59:54,057
Well, I think I might like that.

770
00:59:54,136 --> 00:59:56,263
What do you think, Prok?

771
01:00:04,892 --> 01:00:08,760
Mac, the Rockefeller Foundation
is coming today.

772
01:00:09,797 --> 01:00:13,699
You know I enjoy this... tremendously.

773
01:00:15,936 --> 01:00:19,167
We still have to catalogue
those prints, Martin. Please.

774
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:22,209
Coming, Prok.

775
01:00:22,276 --> 01:00:25,177
It's just, it's a very full day.

776
01:00:25,246 --> 01:00:26,713
Coming.

777
01:00:27,214 --> 01:00:31,173
One key to understanding
a foreign culture is its pornography.

778
01:00:31,285 --> 01:00:36,621
Every culture produces its own peculiar
sexual imagery, as distinct as its cuisine.

779
01:00:36,690 --> 01:00:40,319
As you can see, Brazil's imagery
tends towards zelophilia,

780
01:00:40,561 --> 01:00:43,394
while ltaly favors nuns and priests.

781
01:00:43,464 --> 01:00:46,922
ln England, one often sees depictions
of the stern headmistress.

782
01:00:47,001 --> 01:00:49,401
Wankers and spankers.

783
01:00:49,470 --> 01:00:53,463
While in the Far East,
it's soft flage and light bondage.

784
01:00:53,541 --> 01:00:57,409
- You've amassed an impressive collection.
- Thank you.

785
01:00:57,478 --> 01:01:00,140
Only what I've been able to afford
from my own savings.

786
01:01:00,381 --> 01:01:03,646
lf the Rockefeller Foundation
agrees to our grant,

787
01:01:03,717 --> 01:01:08,313
some of that money will help us build
a world-class library. Herman.

788
01:01:08,389 --> 01:01:11,586
That's 200 years old.

789
01:01:11,659 --> 01:01:14,651
Have you any idea
when you might decide?

790
01:01:14,728 --> 01:01:18,323
Prok, please.
Dr Gregg just got here.

791
01:01:18,966 --> 01:01:22,663
Sometimes I'm amazed
anything has survived.

792
01:01:22,736 --> 01:01:27,696
The Library of Congress has a policy of
destroying whatever it considers too erotic.

793
01:01:27,775 --> 01:01:32,303
The loss to science has been incalculable.

794
01:01:32,413 --> 01:01:38,318
There's time to take your sex histories
before dinner. Who'd like to go first?

795
01:01:40,654 --> 01:01:44,317
l... I don't...

796
01:01:44,391 --> 01:01:48,020
Early in my bug-hunting days,
someone asked me what I was looking for.

797
01:01:48,095 --> 01:01:51,587
I said I wouldn't know
until I saw it statistically.

798
01:01:51,665 --> 01:01:54,725
A scientist can only generalize
with reliable certainty

799
01:01:54,802 --> 01:01:57,270
if he has enough statistical information.

800
01:01:57,338 --> 01:02:03,402
- ls this your first time in Bloomington?
- Yes. It's lovely. Hillier than I expected.

801
01:02:03,477 --> 01:02:06,378
That's why I've broken
the American population down

802
01:02:06,447 --> 01:02:08,915
into 200 major social subgroups.

803
01:02:08,983 --> 01:02:12,578
We'll get 400 to 1000 histories
from each group

804
01:02:12,653 --> 01:02:15,850
for a total of 100,000, give or take a few.

805
01:02:15,923 --> 01:02:19,324
lt could take 20 years,
but we'll finally be able to answer

806
01:02:19,393 --> 01:02:22,294
most of the basic questions
about human sexuality.

807
01:02:22,363 --> 01:02:26,663
- Herman, is the pot roast dry?
- No, it's delicious.

808
01:02:27,501 --> 01:02:32,336
The first publication will be a male volume,
followed a year later by the female study.

809
01:02:32,406 --> 01:02:37,776
Then nine books dealing with sex offenders,
homosexuality, pregnancy and abortion.

810
01:02:37,845 --> 01:02:40,746
And art, studied from a sexual standpoint.

811
01:02:40,814 --> 01:02:44,409
With the children gone,
I don't get to cook big meals anymore.

812
01:02:44,485 --> 01:02:46,453
Mac.
Let's get to the point.

813
01:02:46,520 --> 01:02:52,049
This project is one of the greatest undertaken
in connection with the human animal.

814
01:02:52,126 --> 01:02:58,429
But without support from the Rockefeller
Foundation, it will never get off the ground.

815
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:03,595
There are those who argue that...

816
01:03:03,704 --> 01:03:09,040
sex is largely a matter of feelings
and psychological attitudes -

817
01:03:09,109 --> 01:03:13,011
things beyond your training as a zoologist.

818
01:03:13,080 --> 01:03:17,380
That's like saying a biochemist can't
analyze cooking because he's not a chef.

819
01:03:17,451 --> 01:03:20,215
- It's inane.
- Prok, come on.

820
01:03:20,287 --> 01:03:24,417
That is, it's really a very
stupid way of looking at things.

821
01:03:24,491 --> 01:03:27,255
One of the aims of science is to simplify.

822
01:03:27,528 --> 01:03:31,055
The only way to study sex
with any scientific accuracy

823
01:03:31,131 --> 01:03:34,396
is to strip away everything
but its physiological functions.

824
01:03:34,468 --> 01:03:36,993
And this team you're proposing...

825
01:03:37,104 --> 01:03:40,403
I'll need two pairs of hands,
with advanced degrees in science.

826
01:03:40,474 --> 01:03:42,169
And Clyde Martin, of course.

827
01:03:42,242 --> 01:03:44,676
Since you're working
in such a delicate area,

828
01:03:44,745 --> 01:03:47,873
they need to be as clean
as Fuller Brush men.

829
01:03:49,850 --> 01:03:51,977
Door-to-door salesmen, Prok.

830
01:03:53,153 --> 01:03:55,883
What Dr Gregg is saying is,
anyone involved

831
01:03:55,956 --> 01:04:00,586
needs to have motives that are pure,
scientific, and above reproach morally.

832
01:04:00,861 --> 01:04:03,921
I couldn't agree more.

833
01:04:04,031 --> 01:04:07,057
Now, there's one more thing.

834
01:04:07,601 --> 01:04:12,504
I hope you're not planning to dwell
on sexual oddities and perversions.

835
01:04:12,573 --> 01:04:15,940
Science is always interested in the rare.

836
01:04:16,009 --> 01:04:19,376
Yes, but it's advisable
to stick to what's normal.

837
01:04:19,646 --> 01:04:22,410
You don't want to shake people up.

838
01:04:27,154 --> 01:04:30,715
Of course not.
I'm just a taxonomist, a measurer.

839
01:04:30,791 --> 01:04:34,727
I'm happy to leave
the social policies to others.

840
01:04:36,296 --> 01:04:38,958
Well, that all sounds good.
Very good.

841
01:04:40,100 --> 01:04:44,730
So, if you're ready, I'd like to begin
with a few background questions.

842
01:04:44,805 --> 01:04:49,208
No, all wrong.
Start by putting the subject at ease.

843
01:04:49,276 --> 01:04:53,007
- Would you care for a drink, Mac?
- A glass of water would be very nice.

844
01:04:53,080 --> 01:04:56,538
- Do anything fun this weekend?
- My daughters were in town.

845
01:04:56,617 --> 01:05:00,018
I never stopped.
We had a marvelous meal Saturday night.

846
01:05:00,287 --> 01:05:02,448
- What did you cook?
- I started with...

847
01:05:02,523 --> 01:05:04,548
See how much more relaxed
she's become?

848
01:05:04,625 --> 01:05:08,823
Ease in with innocuous questions and
people forget they're giving sex histories.

849
01:05:08,896 --> 01:05:13,265
- How did you find out about masturbation?
- I invented it, son.

850
01:05:13,333 --> 01:05:16,325
Sometimes I tie a rope around my balls
when I jerk off.

851
01:05:16,403 --> 01:05:19,099
What other masochistic acts do you enjoy?

852
01:05:19,173 --> 01:05:20,401
Does that mean ''queer?''

853
01:05:20,474 --> 01:05:22,840
How often do you have intercourse?

854
01:05:22,910 --> 01:05:24,571
Two or three times.

855
01:05:24,678 --> 01:05:28,011
- A month?
- No, a day.

856
01:05:29,983 --> 01:05:33,851
- How often do you reach orgasm?
- Once.

857
01:05:33,921 --> 01:05:37,379
- A day?
- No, only once.

858
01:05:37,458 --> 01:05:39,449
About 20 years ago.

859
01:05:39,526 --> 01:05:42,290
I was sitting on a piano stool,
listening to music.

860
01:05:43,063 --> 01:05:44,394
That's good.

861
01:05:44,465 --> 01:05:47,798
How old were you when you first
had sexual activity with a partner?

862
01:05:47,868 --> 01:05:49,768
14.

863
01:05:49,837 --> 01:05:52,533
- How?
- With horse.

864
01:05:55,909 --> 01:05:59,140
How often were you having
intercourse with animals at 14?

865
01:05:59,213 --> 01:06:02,182
It's true.
I fucked a pony.

866
01:06:02,249 --> 01:06:05,047
You are genius.
How did you know?

867
01:06:05,118 --> 01:06:08,246
You just said you had sex with a horse.

868
01:06:08,322 --> 01:06:12,622
No. Whores, not horse. Whores.

869
01:06:12,726 --> 01:06:14,785
Do you find my answers typical?

870
01:06:14,862 --> 01:06:17,387
- Am I normal?
- Am I normal?

871
01:06:17,464 --> 01:06:19,159
Am I normal?

872
01:06:22,169 --> 01:06:27,232
I found a book in the dining room buffet,
under all the tablecloths.

873
01:06:27,307 --> 01:06:32,404
And I used to put it under my shirt,
and go into the bathroom and sit and read.

874
01:06:32,479 --> 01:06:34,140
But I was very frightened...

875
01:06:34,214 --> 01:06:36,910
She told her mother she didn't like it.

876
01:06:38,485 --> 01:06:42,785
Or maybe it was just
her mother who didn't like it.

877
01:06:42,890 --> 01:06:47,987
Before you know it,
the police are banging on the front door...

878
01:06:48,061 --> 01:06:51,155
I didn't even know it was illegal.

879
01:06:51,231 --> 01:06:54,496
And now I'm in here for five years.

880
01:06:54,568 --> 01:06:57,628
..l guess I was about nine, ten.

881
01:06:57,704 --> 01:07:02,437
Then she said she was gonna show me
a new game called ''puddin'.''

882
01:07:02,509 --> 01:07:05,945
And I guess I kind of liked it.

883
01:07:06,013 --> 01:07:09,710
- Horses in the stable...
- Out in the field...

884
01:07:47,354 --> 01:07:49,322
..nobody believed me.

885
01:07:49,389 --> 01:07:52,483
Do men put their thing in women?

886
01:08:02,002 --> 01:08:04,436
..you were a fallen woman.
Nobody would want you.

887
01:08:04,504 --> 01:08:07,268
..masculine and feminine traits.

888
01:08:07,341 --> 01:08:09,673
- They were both naked.
- It was part of...

889
01:08:09,743 --> 01:08:11,506
My clothes...

890
01:08:35,502 --> 01:08:38,369
You may kiss the bride.

891
01:08:45,579 --> 01:08:48,639
Professor Kinsey found
a place for us to live.

892
01:08:48,715 --> 01:08:50,945
Let me guess -
it's just a few blocks from here.

893
01:08:51,018 --> 01:08:55,114
- How did you know?
- He likes to keep the troops in one place.

894
01:08:55,188 --> 01:08:57,713
- At least you passed the test.
- What do you mean?

895
01:08:57,958 --> 01:09:01,621
Well, he took your sex history, didn't he?

896
01:09:01,695 --> 01:09:06,394
Well, he wouldn't have let
Clyde marry you unless you fit in.

897
01:09:06,466 --> 01:09:09,697
Didn't Clyde mention the calendars?

898
01:09:10,604 --> 01:09:13,198
Prok likes us to keep a record
of our sexual activity.

899
01:09:13,273 --> 01:09:16,709
Buddy, tell them about that dream
you had the other night.

900
01:09:16,777 --> 01:09:20,338
I was in the middle of the most
intense erotic encounter...

901
01:09:20,414 --> 01:09:24,043
- He wouldn't say who with.
- All of a sudden, the doors flew open.

902
01:09:24,117 --> 01:09:26,779
And there was Prok, with that stern look.

903
01:09:26,853 --> 01:09:30,516
''Hurry up. You're wasting
countless hours of project time.''

904
01:09:30,590 --> 01:09:33,923
- The mood was broken.
- He woke up. I had to take over.

905
01:09:34,027 --> 01:09:36,552
lt was the quickest orgasm he ever had.

906
01:09:36,630 --> 01:09:43,229
We're trying to get pregnant again, so there
was no raincoat to dull the sensation.

907
01:09:44,271 --> 01:09:46,739
Do the Kinseys know
that you talk like this?

908
01:09:49,543 --> 01:09:51,807
Could I get a picture?

909
01:09:53,480 --> 01:09:57,678
Call me when you get back from
the honeymoon. We'll have a nice, long lunch.

910
01:09:57,751 --> 01:10:00,083
Look at the birdie.

911
01:10:00,153 --> 01:10:03,987
No, I've got them.
Thank you.

912
01:10:04,057 --> 01:10:08,460
''Often among boys
who live in cities and towns, comma,

913
01:10:08,528 --> 01:10:11,053
less often among farm boys, period.''

914
01:10:11,131 --> 01:10:14,328
Perhaps you want to say,
''boys from small towns.''

915
01:10:14,401 --> 01:10:16,733
Say... say ''farm boys.''

916
01:10:16,803 --> 01:10:21,069
What's the difference?
He's gonna rewrite it anyway. Henry!

917
01:10:21,141 --> 01:10:24,941
Everything looks in order.
You can have Thanksgiving or Christmas off.

918
01:10:25,011 --> 01:10:27,172
Your choice entirely.

919
01:10:29,483 --> 01:10:32,213
Do you need anything before I go?

920
01:10:32,285 --> 01:10:35,118
We'll never get this book done
if people leave early.

921
01:10:35,188 --> 01:10:39,124
I'll stay if you let me help you.
You don't have the time to answer each one.

922
01:10:39,226 --> 01:10:41,592
lf people write, it's the least I can do.

923
01:10:41,695 --> 01:10:44,323
Mrs Kinsey said to remind you
to come home to eat.

924
01:10:44,397 --> 01:10:46,763
And your father phoned again.

925
01:10:46,833 --> 01:10:49,563
Do you want me to talk to him?

926
01:10:49,636 --> 01:10:51,433
No. I'll do it.

927
01:11:02,149 --> 01:11:07,553
Thine is the kingdom, and the power,
and the glory, forever and ever.

928
01:11:07,621 --> 01:11:09,987
- Amen.
- Amen.

929
01:11:11,925 --> 01:11:15,190
- Hello, Mildred.
- Mr Morrissey.

930
01:11:15,262 --> 01:11:17,787
Come say hello to Father.

931
01:11:28,742 --> 01:11:31,575
I'm very sad for you, Alfred.

932
01:11:31,645 --> 01:11:32,703
Well...

933
01:11:32,779 --> 01:11:35,543
It's not as though I'll be alone.

934
01:11:35,615 --> 01:11:39,244
My daughter's too fat to get a husband.

935
01:11:39,319 --> 01:11:42,152
My son's lost his business
and moved back home.

936
01:11:42,222 --> 01:11:47,455
The only one I got rid of is the big scientist.
Now he's working on some...

937
01:11:47,527 --> 01:11:50,655
secret project.
He was always the secretive type.

938
01:11:50,730 --> 01:11:54,461
Would you really like to know
what I'm working on, Father?

939
01:11:54,534 --> 01:11:56,798
Listen. He's gonna tell me his big secret.

940
01:11:56,870 --> 01:12:02,809
It's really not a secret at all. I'm trying
to find out what people do sexually.

941
01:12:04,277 --> 01:12:07,110
You heard right, Father.
It's a sex study.

942
01:12:10,317 --> 01:12:14,253
- What do you expect me to do, applaud?
- No.

943
01:12:17,858 --> 01:12:22,591
But I would like you
to contribute to the project.

944
01:12:25,899 --> 01:12:28,993
And you first moved to Hoboken
at what age?

945
01:12:29,069 --> 01:12:30,969
16.

946
01:12:31,738 --> 01:12:34,571
Could have done this interview
without me, Al.

947
01:12:34,808 --> 01:12:37,174
I haven't told you a thing
you didn't know.

948
01:12:37,244 --> 01:12:40,372
Let's move on, then.

949
01:12:40,447 --> 01:12:43,177
How young were you
when you first masturbated?

950
01:12:43,250 --> 01:12:45,741
- What?
- Touched yourself.

951
01:12:45,819 --> 01:12:47,343
I never did that.

952
01:12:47,420 --> 01:12:50,514
The male without a history of masturbation
is almost nonexistent.

953
01:12:50,590 --> 01:12:52,581
Well, he exists, Al.

954
01:12:52,659 --> 01:12:54,957
And you're looking at him.

955
01:12:55,028 --> 01:12:58,020
This isn't gonna work.

956
01:12:58,098 --> 01:13:01,431
I don't know why I bothered.

957
01:13:01,501 --> 01:13:04,493
Stay where you are.

958
01:13:07,674 --> 01:13:10,973
I'll try again.

959
01:13:15,615 --> 01:13:20,075
How often did your masturbation
occur in adolescence?

960
01:13:25,659 --> 01:13:28,594
There was a problem.

961
01:13:28,695 --> 01:13:34,725
''A chronic condition'',
the doctors called it.

962
01:13:35,702 --> 01:13:38,262
How long did this continue?

963
01:13:40,573 --> 01:13:43,064
I was outfitted...

964
01:13:44,077 --> 01:13:48,013
with a tight strap
that I had to wear at all times.

965
01:13:49,683 --> 01:13:53,585
lt kept me from coming into contact
with my genitals.

966
01:13:53,653 --> 01:13:58,750
lt was a...
highly embarrassing remedy.

967
01:13:58,858 --> 01:14:02,954
But it proved effective.
The condition was cured.

968
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:08,290
How old were you?

969
01:14:13,340 --> 01:14:15,331
I was ten.

970
01:14:23,750 --> 01:14:26,048
I'm so sorry, Dad.

971
01:14:39,399 --> 01:14:42,095
I'm feeling a little tired now.

972
01:14:54,848 --> 01:14:58,909
Sounds to me like you're
wasting your time, Al.

973
01:14:59,919 --> 01:15:03,252
Nobody wants to know about these things.

974
01:15:06,659 --> 01:15:08,627
When can we see Dr Kinsey?

975
01:15:08,695 --> 01:15:11,027
That's him.
That's Kinsey.

976
01:15:13,433 --> 01:15:16,891
My name is Dr Thurman Rice,
and I'd be happy to talk to you

977
01:15:16,970 --> 01:15:20,337
about Professor Kinsey's repugnant book.

978
01:15:20,407 --> 01:15:25,310
You're free to read and take notes
but the manuscript is not to leave the room.

979
01:15:25,378 --> 01:15:27,539
I won't deny the going might get rough.

980
01:15:27,614 --> 01:15:31,482
Dr Kinsey's findings are surprising,
sometimes even shocking.

981
01:15:31,551 --> 01:15:36,284
For example, marital sex,
the only kind everyone agrees on,

982
01:15:36,356 --> 01:15:40,588
is only one of nine means by which
the American male achieves orgasm.

983
01:15:40,660 --> 01:15:43,686
Premarital sex, extramarital sex,

984
01:15:43,763 --> 01:15:46,288
masturbation and homosexuality

985
01:15:46,433 --> 01:15:51,132
are much more prevalent than
anyone has ever imagined before.

986
01:15:52,205 --> 01:15:53,832
I can assure you...

987
01:15:54,074 --> 01:15:59,239
that Dr Kinsey has done everything in
his power to present this book tastefully.

988
01:15:59,312 --> 01:16:04,477
So, I thought this might be a good time
to ask for a formal show of support.

989
01:16:04,551 --> 01:16:05,779
Those in favor...

990
01:16:21,701 --> 01:16:25,603
I just hope it's not going
to bring too much publicity.

991
01:16:25,672 --> 01:16:29,438
With any luck, Mrs Spaulding,
general public won't even notice.

992
01:16:50,463 --> 01:16:53,489
That'll be six fifty, please.

993
01:17:12,352 --> 01:17:17,756
But in a few of the cultures,
sex remains a dirty secret.

994
01:17:21,694 --> 01:17:25,824
Mark my words.
As soon as the publicity dies down,

995
01:17:25,899 --> 01:17:32,532
the American public will greet this book
with the thunder and silence it deserves.

996
01:17:32,872 --> 01:17:34,897
What brings you to New York, Dr Kinsey?

997
01:17:35,141 --> 01:17:38,599
We'll be taking the sex histories
of artists, writers and actors,

998
01:17:38,678 --> 01:17:41,909
including the entire cast
of A Streetcar Named Desire,

999
01:17:41,981 --> 01:17:45,883
We'll also be interviewing women
for our next book, a female study,

1000
01:17:45,952 --> 01:17:48,477
as well as meeting with
the Rockefeller Foundation.

1001
01:17:48,755 --> 01:17:53,124
- Are you surprised at the book's success?
- No. It shows the world has wanted this done.

1002
01:17:53,193 --> 01:17:55,753
Any plans on a Hollywood picture
based on the book?

1003
01:17:56,029 --> 01:18:00,295
- I can't think of anything more pointless.
- What about you, Mrs Kinsey?

1004
01:18:00,366 --> 01:18:03,767
- Has your life changed much?
- My husband's busier than ever.

1005
01:18:03,836 --> 01:18:08,739
- I hardly see him since he's taken up sex.
- What about the female study?

1006
01:18:10,677 --> 01:18:13,942
Gentlemen. Gentlemen.
Gentlemen, please.

1007
01:18:14,013 --> 01:18:19,110
lf you want to write about something useful,
look into the current sex-offender codes.

1008
01:18:19,185 --> 01:18:23,713
The majority of sex offenders in our prisons
have nothing in their histories

1009
01:18:23,790 --> 01:18:26,452
different from the rest of the population.

1010
01:18:26,526 --> 01:18:31,122
Their only crime is being too poor
to hire a lawyer. This is unfair.

1011
01:18:31,197 --> 01:18:37,466
Everybody's sin is nobody's sin.
And everybody's crime is no crime at all.

1012
01:18:38,838 --> 01:18:41,534
''Everybody's sin is nobody's sin.''

1013
01:18:41,641 --> 01:18:43,939
That wasn't my point at all.

1014
01:18:44,010 --> 01:18:48,413
Newspapers lift things out of context
to make sensational reading.

1015
01:18:48,481 --> 01:18:51,473
It's hardly your place
to offer moral prescription.

1016
01:18:51,551 --> 01:18:56,215
You're sounding more like
a preacher than a scientist.

1017
01:18:56,489 --> 01:18:59,049
My father always hoped
I'd become a preacher.

1018
01:18:59,125 --> 01:19:03,562
And why do you insist on flaunting
your association with the Foundation?

1019
01:19:03,830 --> 01:19:07,357
Haven't I just given you the best-selling
scientific volume ever published?

1020
01:19:07,433 --> 01:19:09,697
- Not only here, but across the globe?
- Yes.

1021
01:19:09,769 --> 01:19:14,672
And it's casting a bright light
on every aspect of the project.

1022
01:19:14,741 --> 01:19:19,440
Especially some of
your latest methodology.

1023
01:19:22,181 --> 01:19:25,981
- Who have you been talking to?
- I assume most of it is gossip.

1024
01:19:26,052 --> 01:19:28,543
Alan.

1025
01:19:28,788 --> 01:19:35,421
It's been said that
you've taken to observing women.

1026
01:19:36,529 --> 01:19:37,655
Go on.

1027
01:19:37,730 --> 01:19:41,427
ln a heightened state of arousal.

1028
01:19:44,871 --> 01:19:46,839
It's true?

1029
01:19:46,906 --> 01:19:49,170
Yes. And do you know why?

1030
01:19:49,275 --> 01:19:53,336
We went to the leading gynecologists
and asked for physical measurements.

1031
01:19:53,413 --> 01:19:56,109
They barely knew
what we were talking about.

1032
01:19:56,182 --> 01:20:02,178
When it comes to female sex organs,
we're all tragically ignorant.

1033
01:20:02,288 --> 01:20:06,588
- Who are these women?
- Volunteers. Friends of the project.

1034
01:20:06,659 --> 01:20:08,627
- Prostitutes?
- No.

1035
01:20:08,695 --> 01:20:12,791
Prostitutes are useless.
They fake their orgasms.

1036
01:20:12,899 --> 01:20:15,129
- Jesus.
- Alan.

1037
01:20:15,201 --> 01:20:21,401
The sex histories we have are invaluable.
True science lies in direct observation.

1038
01:20:21,474 --> 01:20:26,275
Nothing can replace what the eye
can see directly. Or the camera.

1039
01:20:26,346 --> 01:20:27,938
Camera?

1040
01:20:28,181 --> 01:20:31,639
Don't tell me, you're making movies?

1041
01:20:31,718 --> 01:20:35,085
Just some photographic studies
of mammalian behavior.

1042
01:20:36,856 --> 01:20:40,223
Nature films. Animals?

1043
01:20:40,993 --> 01:20:43,587
Yes, if you like.

1044
01:20:48,201 --> 01:20:51,432
Gentlemen, you're about to meet
a truly rare creature.

1045
01:20:51,504 --> 01:20:55,440
Even the most casual contact
arouses a sexual response in her.

1046
01:20:55,508 --> 01:21:00,309
ln intercourse, her first orgasm occurs
within two to five seconds after entry.

1047
01:21:01,314 --> 01:21:04,374
- All set there, Barbara?
- I think so.

1048
01:21:04,450 --> 01:21:06,350
Come on in.

1049
01:21:12,492 --> 01:21:14,585
- Hello.
- How do you do?

1050
01:21:14,660 --> 01:21:20,997
Did I mention that Barbara didn't have
her first orgasm until she was 40?

1051
01:21:21,067 --> 01:21:25,060
Notice how she gently strokes
the inner lips and the clitoris.

1052
01:21:25,138 --> 01:21:28,369
84 per cent of our samples
stimulate themselves this way.

1053
01:21:28,441 --> 01:21:30,841
What about the vagina?

1054
01:21:30,910 --> 01:21:34,539
For all but a small minority of women,
the vaginal tube is a dead cavity.

1055
01:21:34,614 --> 01:21:37,412
Practically devoid of nerve endings.

1056
01:21:37,483 --> 01:21:42,819
The introduction of the penis does nothing
to relocate the source of stimulation.

1057
01:21:42,889 --> 01:21:45,983
Even with as skilful a partner as Pomeroy.

1058
01:21:46,626 --> 01:21:49,789
- That is you, isn't it?
- Last time I looked.

1059
01:21:49,896 --> 01:21:54,993
For years, women have been told that
a clitoral orgasm is immature, neurotic.

1060
01:21:55,067 --> 01:21:59,470
So they've struggled, with great anxiety,
to relocate the orgasm in the vagina

1061
01:21:59,539 --> 01:22:03,441
when, for many,
it's a biologic impossibility.

1062
01:22:04,844 --> 01:22:10,976
According to the psychoanalysts,
this woman is frigid.

1063
01:22:11,451 --> 01:22:12,884
Good news, everyone.

1064
01:22:12,952 --> 01:22:16,945
The Rockefeller Foundation
announced its annual grants today.

1065
01:22:17,023 --> 01:22:20,356
We've received 40,000 dollars
for the next year -

1066
01:22:20,426 --> 01:22:24,419
the highest grant they've ever bestowed
on a scientific project.

1067
01:22:24,497 --> 01:22:27,830
And they've agreed
to underwrite a new corporation,

1068
01:22:28,067 --> 01:22:32,936
making us future employees
of the lnstitute for Sex Research.

1069
01:22:33,039 --> 01:22:35,701
- Dr Kinsey.
- Here, here.

1070
01:22:35,775 --> 01:22:38,107
- And Mrs Kinsey.
- Here, here.

1071
01:22:38,177 --> 01:22:42,307
And to our husbands,
the Fuller Brush men of sex.

1072
01:22:42,381 --> 01:22:45,145
Come here, my little prick nibbler.

1073
01:22:47,320 --> 01:22:50,619
Come on, everyone.
Enjoy yourselves.

1074
01:22:52,558 --> 01:22:55,686
- You don't look happy.
- No, I am. Really.

1075
01:22:55,761 --> 01:22:58,924
It's just that Clyde is going
to be away for so long this time.

1076
01:22:58,998 --> 01:23:02,695
Well, don't worry.
I'll keep an eye on him.

1077
01:23:02,768 --> 01:23:06,101
A lot of good that will do.

1078
01:23:06,172 --> 01:23:09,869
What are you trying to say, Mrs Martin?

1079
01:23:09,942 --> 01:23:13,810
God, you're pretty.

1080
01:23:14,046 --> 01:23:17,482
Drink up your grape juice.
We've gathered only 9,300 histories.

1081
01:23:17,550 --> 01:23:22,487
We have the female volume to complete.
From tomorrow, we need to triple our efforts.

1082
01:23:22,555 --> 01:23:26,889
It's still tonight, and since my third leg
keeps hitting me in the face,

1083
01:23:26,959 --> 01:23:30,326
I think it's time for a tumble.

1084
01:23:44,810 --> 01:23:49,213
ln the bonobo chimpanzee,
our nearest primate relation,

1085
01:23:49,282 --> 01:23:53,378
sex is the glue
of social cohesion and peace.

1086
01:23:53,452 --> 01:23:58,219
Cleared of notions like romantic love,
religion or morality,

1087
01:23:58,291 --> 01:24:00,725
their society's behavior hangs together

1088
01:24:00,960 --> 01:24:03,895
as a coherent unit
of biology and conditioning.

1089
01:24:04,130 --> 01:24:08,794
Based on the experiences of females
who have contributed to our histories,

1090
01:24:08,868 --> 01:24:14,534
we have observed a wide range
of motivations for extramarital coitus.

1091
01:24:14,607 --> 01:24:20,273
At times, it is a conscious or unconscious
attempt to acquire social status.

1092
01:24:20,346 --> 01:24:25,283
ln other instances, it gives them a variety
of experiences with new sexual partners

1093
01:24:25,351 --> 01:24:29,811
who are sometimes superior
to their marriage partner.

1094
01:24:29,889 --> 01:24:32,858
There are occasions
when it is done in retaliation

1095
01:24:32,925 --> 01:24:39,524
for the partner's extramarital activity,
or for some sort of non-sexual mistreatment.

1096
01:24:40,866 --> 01:24:45,303
Some females discover new sources
of emotional satisfaction,

1097
01:24:45,371 --> 01:24:49,137
while others find it impossible
to share such an intimate relationship

1098
01:24:49,208 --> 01:24:51,233
with more than one partner.

1099
01:24:55,781 --> 01:24:58,614
We have also encountered
a considerable group of cases

1100
01:24:58,684 --> 01:25:03,553
in which husbands encourage their wives
to engage in extramarital activities

1101
01:25:03,623 --> 01:25:05,921
in an honest attempt
to give them the opportunity

1102
01:25:05,992 --> 01:25:10,019
for additional sexual satisfaction.

1103
01:25:26,212 --> 01:25:29,113
I've corresponded
with this man for over ten years,

1104
01:25:29,181 --> 01:25:31,649
but I never thought he'd agree to meet me.

1105
01:25:31,717 --> 01:25:34,208
He's amassed a lifetime of data.

1106
01:25:35,521 --> 01:25:39,480
Working for the forestry department
has involved a lot of traveling.

1107
01:25:39,558 --> 01:25:43,756
So I've met a wide array of people.

1108
01:25:43,829 --> 01:25:46,389
- By the way, my name is...
- Please. There's no need.

1109
01:25:46,465 --> 01:25:48,092
..Kenneth Braun.

1110
01:25:48,334 --> 01:25:51,269
Don't worry, Dr Kinsey.
I trust you.

1111
01:25:53,239 --> 01:25:56,208
- We're actually a lot alike, you know.
- How so?

1112
01:25:56,275 --> 01:26:00,234
I record everything, too.
The depth of every vagina I've encountered.

1113
01:26:00,312 --> 01:26:03,440
The length and circumference
of every penis.

1114
01:26:03,516 --> 01:26:07,919
The time to reach orgasm.
The distance of ejaculation.

1115
01:26:08,187 --> 01:26:11,782
I've written it all down.

1116
01:26:11,857 --> 01:26:16,123
This is a record of my life's real work.

1117
01:26:16,195 --> 01:26:18,288
Which is sex, by the way.

1118
01:26:19,765 --> 01:26:22,233
I find that recording is a...

1119
01:26:22,301 --> 01:26:26,738
is a way to experience things
a second time. Don't you?

1120
01:26:28,074 --> 01:26:32,670
I also have certain... rare abilities.

1121
01:26:33,612 --> 01:26:36,376
From a completely flaccid start,

1122
01:26:36,449 --> 01:26:41,785
I can become erect
and ejaculate in ten seconds flat.

1123
01:26:41,854 --> 01:26:46,518
I'd say that's pretty much
physiologically impossible.

1124
01:26:46,759 --> 01:26:49,523
Why, the rush of blood alone would...

1125
01:27:11,851 --> 01:27:13,443
Shall we get started?

1126
01:27:13,519 --> 01:27:17,717
My grandmother introduced me
to sexual intercourse when I was ten.

1127
01:27:17,790 --> 01:27:23,990
My first homosexual act
was with my father.

1128
01:27:24,063 --> 01:27:29,660
Of the 33 members of my extended family,
I've had sex with 17 of them.

1129
01:27:29,735 --> 01:27:31,293
That's five generations.

1130
01:27:31,370 --> 01:27:37,866
My penis is 8.24 inches long with
a diameter of 2.8 inches when fully erect.

1131
01:27:37,943 --> 01:27:42,778
ln my youth, I averaged eight cubic
centimeters of semen per ejaculation.

1132
01:27:43,015 --> 01:27:45,813
By the time I was 50, I was down to five...

1133
01:27:45,885 --> 01:27:49,013
I've had sex with 22 separate
species of animals...

1134
01:27:49,288 --> 01:27:54,157
I've had intercourse with 9,412 people.

1135
01:27:54,226 --> 01:27:59,061
I've had sexual relations with...

1136
01:27:59,131 --> 01:28:03,465
605 preadolescent males and...

1137
01:28:05,404 --> 01:28:09,340
231 preadolescent females.

1138
01:28:10,709 --> 01:28:13,303
Have you ever seen a boy orgasm?

1139
01:28:14,613 --> 01:28:16,581
No.

1140
01:28:19,251 --> 01:28:22,345
I guess that's why I'm such a catch.

1141
01:28:22,421 --> 01:28:27,381
Physiologically, it's almost
identical to an adult orgasm.

1142
01:28:27,459 --> 01:28:30,394
Screw this.
I'll see you down at the bar.

1143
01:28:40,005 --> 01:28:43,566
Thought you trained him to be impartial.

1144
01:28:43,642 --> 01:28:45,872
Sometimes it's difficult.

1145
01:28:47,112 --> 01:28:51,913
I suppose someone like me really
puts your beliefs to the test.

1146
01:28:52,017 --> 01:28:54,247
- How?
- You know.

1147
01:28:54,320 --> 01:28:58,154
- Everybody should do what they want.
- I've never said that.

1148
01:28:58,224 --> 01:29:00,954
No one should be forced to do
anything against their will.

1149
01:29:01,026 --> 01:29:03,460
No one should ever be hurt.

1150
01:29:05,464 --> 01:29:09,833
You know, you're a lot more square
than I thought you'd be.

1151
01:29:11,070 --> 01:29:13,800
Let's get on with it.

1152
01:29:15,107 --> 01:29:17,075
Sure.

1153
01:29:41,033 --> 01:29:45,333
Please, Governor.
You're so angry, I can't reason with you.

1154
01:29:45,404 --> 01:29:48,862
When you calm down, we'll discuss it.

1155
01:29:51,310 --> 01:29:55,474
Seems that the archbishop of Fort Wayne
tipped off the customs board.

1156
01:29:55,581 --> 01:30:01,816
What is it with these people? They're simply
depictions of man in his natural state.

1157
01:30:01,887 --> 01:30:04,481
I don't know much about natural states, Prok,

1158
01:30:04,556 --> 01:30:07,548
but here in the state of Indiana,
we have a problem.

1159
01:30:07,626 --> 01:30:10,527
We'll have to take
the customs office to court.

1160
01:30:10,596 --> 01:30:12,928
Who's gonna pay,
the Rockefeller Foundation?

1161
01:30:13,165 --> 01:30:17,329
- You're an inch away from losing your grant.
- That's not true.

1162
01:30:17,403 --> 01:30:19,064
What do you mean?

1163
01:30:19,171 --> 01:30:25,440
Hoover is annoyed you won't help him find
homosexuals in the State Department.

1164
01:30:25,711 --> 01:30:31,047
lt is rumored that he is
compiling dossiers on you.

1165
01:30:33,285 --> 01:30:35,344
The activities of your staff.

1166
01:30:35,454 --> 01:30:39,788
And, as you know, there have been
complaints about your statistical methods.

1167
01:30:39,858 --> 01:30:44,522
Trumped-up nonsense.
Nothing but disguised prudery.

1168
01:30:44,596 --> 01:30:46,860
Prok.

1169
01:30:46,932 --> 01:30:49,662
Maybe there were small mistakes
in the male study,

1170
01:30:49,735 --> 01:30:53,796
but we've corrected them
in the female volume.

1171
01:30:53,872 --> 01:30:57,706
This will be a very great book, Herman.
Much better than the first.

1172
01:30:57,776 --> 01:30:59,505
Let's hope so.

1173
01:31:07,853 --> 01:31:11,653
Kinsey is a deranged Nebuchadnezzar,

1174
01:31:11,724 --> 01:31:15,057
leading women out into the fields
to mingle with cattle.

1175
01:31:15,127 --> 01:31:19,029
''Self-appointed messiah
of the sexually despised.''

1176
01:31:19,098 --> 01:31:21,396
''Having had his way
with the male of the species,

1177
01:31:21,467 --> 01:31:24,459
Kinsey now insecticizes
American womanhood.''

1178
01:31:24,536 --> 01:31:26,231
Did you get any sleep last night?

1179
01:31:26,305 --> 01:31:28,603
How many years do I have
to study human behavior

1180
01:31:28,674 --> 01:31:31,643
- before I'm no longer an entomologist?
- Why do you read them?

1181
01:31:31,744 --> 01:31:35,840
I'm trying to find out
why people hate this book so.

1182
01:31:35,914 --> 01:31:39,281
You told them their grandmothers
and daughters are masturbating,

1183
01:31:39,351 --> 01:31:41,842
having premarital sex,
sex with each other.

1184
01:31:41,920 --> 01:31:44,980
- What did you expect?
- Some respect.

1185
01:31:48,327 --> 01:31:50,761
- Don't answer it.
- Hello.

1186
01:31:50,829 --> 01:31:55,664
Hey, Kinsey, what kind of sick man
are you? Why do you want to...

1187
01:32:00,539 --> 01:32:02,598
We're in trouble.

1188
01:32:02,708 --> 01:32:05,939
The cost of film stock is astronomical.

1189
01:32:06,011 --> 01:32:08,878
Shouldn't our nonprofit status
get us a discount?

1190
01:32:08,947 --> 01:32:12,348
You've got to let some of this go.
We need a full-time accountant.

1191
01:32:12,451 --> 01:32:14,282
What in heaven's...?

1192
01:32:17,423 --> 01:32:21,120
Stop this. Stop it at once.
ln my office.

1193
01:32:21,193 --> 01:32:24,993
Gebhard, get in here.
Everyone, back to work.

1194
01:32:28,167 --> 01:32:32,160
Do you have any idea
what a delicate time this is?

1195
01:32:32,237 --> 01:32:36,196
Our enemies are watching everything we do.
We can't afford a single slip-up.

1196
01:32:36,275 --> 01:32:40,507
- This has nothing to do with the project.
- Everything is about the project.

1197
01:32:40,579 --> 01:32:44,037
- It was just a misunderstanding.
- No, it's not.

1198
01:32:44,116 --> 01:32:48,018
You let things get out of hand with
Martin's wife. Now she wants to leave him.

1199
01:32:48,087 --> 01:32:51,386
lsn't that right, Martin?

1200
01:32:53,025 --> 01:32:57,121
What about you, Gebhard? Are you
planning to leave Agnes and the kids?

1201
01:32:57,196 --> 01:32:59,687
- No, of course not.
- Then end it.

1202
01:33:00,332 --> 01:33:02,596
- I've tried.
- It's not difficult.

1203
01:33:02,668 --> 01:33:06,661
Just tell her it's over.
No explanation necessary.

1204
01:33:08,006 --> 01:33:09,871
All right.

1205
01:33:14,179 --> 01:33:19,378
Clyde, I'm...
I'm very sorry about all of this.

1206
01:33:26,291 --> 01:33:30,489
I saw this coming.
Gebhard should've nipped it in the bud.

1207
01:33:30,562 --> 01:33:33,656
You are so full of shit.

1208
01:33:35,100 --> 01:33:41,300
What are we to you, Prok? We're just lab rats?
Just another part of the project?

1209
01:33:41,373 --> 01:33:44,240
To prove that sex...
No, I'm sorry.

1210
01:33:44,309 --> 01:33:51,112
Fucking... is nothing more than friction

1211
01:33:51,183 --> 01:33:52,946
and harmless fun?

1212
01:33:54,319 --> 01:33:56,446
Well, let me tell you.

1213
01:33:56,522 --> 01:34:03,655
That is a risky game, because fucking
isn'tjust something. It's the whole thing.

1214
01:34:04,663 --> 01:34:07,154
And if you're not careful,

1215
01:34:07,232 --> 01:34:10,690
it will cut you wide open.

1216
01:34:15,541 --> 01:34:19,807
Go home to your wife, Clyde.
She's going to need you.

1217
01:34:38,363 --> 01:34:40,422
I thought the rules were clear.

1218
01:34:40,499 --> 01:34:45,368
No intense romantic entanglements.
They only make people's lives unstable.

1219
01:34:45,437 --> 01:34:50,841
Well, I guess we all can't be
as disciplined as you, Prok.

1220
01:34:56,615 --> 01:35:01,712
The question of marital infidelity remains
one of the most complicated issues

1221
01:35:01,787 --> 01:35:05,746
facing our society today.

1222
01:35:05,824 --> 01:35:11,490
Reconciliation of the married individual's
desire for a variety of sexual partners

1223
01:35:11,563 --> 01:35:15,329
and the maintenance of a stable marriage
presents a problem,

1224
01:35:15,567 --> 01:35:20,197
which has not been satisfactorily
resolved in our culture.

1225
01:35:20,272 --> 01:35:25,266
The fact is, America is awash
in sexual activity,

1226
01:35:25,344 --> 01:35:30,372
only a small portion of which
is sanctioned by society.

1227
01:35:30,482 --> 01:35:34,851
Sexual morality needs to be reformed.

1228
01:35:34,920 --> 01:35:37,582
And science will show the way.

1229
01:35:41,326 --> 01:35:44,853
Sometimes...

1230
01:35:46,431 --> 01:35:50,197
I sometimes wonder what
this country would look like

1231
01:35:50,269 --> 01:35:54,672
if the Puritans had stayed at home.

1232
01:35:54,740 --> 01:36:00,508
What if all the rogues and libertines
had crossed the Atlantic instead?

1233
01:36:13,959 --> 01:36:17,486
But the enforcers of chastity
are massing once again,

1234
01:36:17,562 --> 01:36:21,293
to dissuade the scientist, intimidate him.

1235
01:36:25,804 --> 01:36:29,365
Convince him to cease research.

1236
01:36:36,081 --> 01:36:37,105
Yes, Mrs Kinsey.

1237
01:36:37,182 --> 01:36:39,275
Mac?

1238
01:36:44,823 --> 01:36:49,487
He's killing himself...
and you have to help me stop him.

1239
01:36:49,561 --> 01:36:51,620
OK.

1240
01:37:02,674 --> 01:37:04,608
Hi.

1241
01:37:08,413 --> 01:37:13,544
Doctors say my heart
sounds like a cement mixer.

1242
01:37:14,886 --> 01:37:18,686
At least they found one.

1243
01:37:18,757 --> 01:37:24,389
Seems I've developed
a dependency on barbiturates.

1244
01:37:24,963 --> 01:37:29,832
So, if I've been a bit harsh lately...

1245
01:37:35,741 --> 01:37:39,040
- How's Alice?
- She's fine.

1246
01:37:41,113 --> 01:37:44,105
We're fine.
You should get some sleep.

1247
01:37:50,255 --> 01:37:53,486
It's always been my biggest fear, Clyde.

1248
01:37:53,558 --> 01:37:56,891
Dying before I finish this work.

1249
01:38:10,776 --> 01:38:14,576
ln the course of these hearings
on tax-exempt foundations,

1250
01:38:14,646 --> 01:38:19,140
we intend to show how communists
are financed in the United States.

1251
01:38:19,217 --> 01:38:23,017
There is a diabolical conspiracy
back of all this,

1252
01:38:23,288 --> 01:38:26,849
and its aim is the furtherance
of socialism in America.

1253
01:38:26,925 --> 01:38:33,330
Do you agree that Kinsey's research
aids the communistic aim

1254
01:38:33,398 --> 01:38:37,562
of weakening and destroying
the youth of our country?

1255
01:38:37,636 --> 01:38:40,366
I do not agree, sir.

1256
01:38:40,439 --> 01:38:45,570
Well, tell me, Dr Gregg,
does the Rockefeller Foundation

1257
01:38:45,644 --> 01:38:50,172
really believe that it belongs
in the business of sex research?

1258
01:39:06,131 --> 01:39:10,261
I think it's probably
something the Foundation

1259
01:39:10,335 --> 01:39:12,530
shouldn't have anything to do with.

1260
01:39:19,544 --> 01:39:26,507
Dr Kinsey's project is now in a position
to obtain support from...

1261
01:39:26,585 --> 01:39:28,917
other sources.

1262
01:39:41,633 --> 01:39:44,727
With the loss of support
from the Rockefeller Foundation,

1263
01:39:44,803 --> 01:39:50,105
Dr Kinsey's project will need
other funding if it is to survive.

1264
01:39:52,477 --> 01:39:54,570
Prok?

1265
01:39:56,314 --> 01:39:58,976
Prok, you home?

1266
01:39:59,217 --> 01:40:02,948
We are running a budget surplus
due to increased enrolment,

1267
01:40:03,021 --> 01:40:07,720
which is a direct result
of Dr Kinsey's success and fame.

1268
01:40:08,527 --> 01:40:14,989
A small amount of this money would
be enough to keep the project afloat.

1269
01:40:17,102 --> 01:40:19,195
Prok?

1270
01:40:29,114 --> 01:40:30,138
Prok?

1271
01:40:32,651 --> 01:40:34,278
Why don't we put it to a vote?

1272
01:40:34,352 --> 01:40:38,311
All those in favor of increasing
Dr Kinsey's grant...

1273
01:41:16,895 --> 01:41:19,557
That's it, then.

1274
01:41:21,299 --> 01:41:26,828
This woman was beaten by her father
when she first menstruated.

1275
01:41:26,905 --> 01:41:30,966
Now she's incapable of
physical intimacy of any kind.

1276
01:41:33,111 --> 01:41:36,603
And this man -
''Dear Dr Kinsey.''

1277
01:41:36,681 --> 01:41:39,878
''lt has taken me
a long time to write to you.''

1278
01:41:39,951 --> 01:41:43,216
''l suppose because
I was too ashamed and l...''

1279
01:41:43,455 --> 01:41:46,652
Where'd that blood come from?

1280
01:41:46,725 --> 01:41:49,091
I punctured my foreskin.

1281
01:41:52,197 --> 01:41:57,760
I wanted to understand different...
different kinds of sensations.

1282
01:42:00,238 --> 01:42:04,504
lt didn't give me any pleasure.

1283
01:42:04,576 --> 01:42:06,976
And there was only a little...

1284
01:42:09,581 --> 01:42:12,311
pain.

1285
01:42:24,195 --> 01:42:28,325
I couldn't help them, Mac.

1286
01:42:28,400 --> 01:42:30,334
I couldn't figure it out.

1287
01:42:30,402 --> 01:42:32,666
Just stop punishing yourself.

1288
01:42:32,737 --> 01:42:35,934
Now I've ruined it for everyone.

1289
01:43:01,933 --> 01:43:05,391
This is an exercise in futility.

1290
01:43:05,470 --> 01:43:08,564
Huntington Hartford
is the heir to the A&P fortune.

1291
01:43:08,640 --> 01:43:10,767
He can solve your
financial problems with a pen.

1292
01:43:11,042 --> 01:43:13,101
I won't beg, Mac.

1293
01:43:17,482 --> 01:43:19,347
I won't beg.

1294
01:43:19,417 --> 01:43:22,443
Ohio deplores fellatio
but tolerates cunnilingus.

1295
01:43:22,520 --> 01:43:26,286
ln my home state of Indiana,
all forms of oral sex are illegal,

1296
01:43:26,391 --> 01:43:28,689
even within marriage.

1297
01:43:30,061 --> 01:43:33,963
The current sex laws are completely
out of touch with the real world.

1298
01:43:34,032 --> 01:43:38,332
I've had four wives. Some people say
that makes me a sex offender.

1299
01:43:39,871 --> 01:43:44,570
Hunt, if you keep interrupting Dr Kinsey,
you're gonna have to find a fifth.

1300
01:43:46,111 --> 01:43:47,772
Please, go on.

1301
01:43:47,846 --> 01:43:52,112
Even now, 43 states will punish
a single act of adulterous intercourse.

1302
01:43:52,183 --> 01:43:58,122
I'm thinking of building a museum. What's
your opinion of modern art, Dr Kinsey?

1303
01:43:59,124 --> 01:44:02,355
It's not my area of expertise, Mr Hartford.

1304
01:44:02,427 --> 01:44:06,022
I really don't consider myself
qualified to discuss it.

1305
01:44:06,297 --> 01:44:09,858
Well, why not?
Just because I own some supermarkets

1306
01:44:09,934 --> 01:44:14,234
that doesn't mean I'm only capable
of talking about groceries.

1307
01:44:17,442 --> 01:44:19,535
Do you hate modern art as much as I do?

1308
01:44:19,611 --> 01:44:23,342
Squiggly lines, empty canvases...

1309
01:44:23,448 --> 01:44:26,781
So, the next book
will deal with sex offenders?

1310
01:44:26,851 --> 01:44:30,912
We need money, Mrs Hartford.

1311
01:44:34,959 --> 01:44:37,052
We need someone to give us money.

1312
01:44:37,128 --> 01:44:39,858
You have no idea what I've had to endure

1313
01:44:39,931 --> 01:44:43,890
just to obtain the same rights
other scientists take for granted.

1314
01:44:43,968 --> 01:44:48,871
My funding has been slashed and my name
has been dragged through the mud

1315
01:44:49,107 --> 01:44:53,271
in every newspaper and magazine
across this country.

1316
01:44:54,078 --> 01:44:58,674
Every dollar I've ever earned has...
Leave me alone.

1317
01:45:00,819 --> 01:45:03,982
Every dollar I've ever made
has gone back into the project.

1318
01:45:04,055 --> 01:45:08,958
But fighting this customs case has cost us
an appalling amount. We're broke.

1319
01:45:09,060 --> 01:45:11,255
- Dr Kinsey...
- Please.

1320
01:45:11,329 --> 01:45:14,787
I'm not even sure how much time
I have left. Help me.

1321
01:45:14,866 --> 01:45:17,801
I have to get it all in the record.

1322
01:45:17,869 --> 01:45:19,734
Well, I'm very sorry.

1323
01:45:19,804 --> 01:45:24,571
Any support I give might be misconstrued
as an endorsement of sex.

1324
01:45:24,642 --> 01:45:27,042
I can't afford that kind of exposure.

1325
01:45:27,111 --> 01:45:29,238
I see.

1326
01:45:29,314 --> 01:45:33,375
But I'm sure something will come through.

1327
01:45:49,100 --> 01:45:52,797
You're right.
Rich people have lazy minds.

1328
01:45:52,871 --> 01:45:56,602
Took them five minutes
to find a water glass.

1329
01:45:58,176 --> 01:46:01,612
I'm taking you to the hospital.

1330
01:46:01,679 --> 01:46:05,376
No. No more beds.

1331
01:46:05,450 --> 01:46:10,581
I spent my whole childhood lying in bed.

1332
01:46:15,760 --> 01:46:18,490
Let's go back to the hotel, Mac.

1333
01:46:18,563 --> 01:46:22,556
I want to pick up a few histories
in the morning.

1334
01:46:27,705 --> 01:46:32,472
We'd been married for 23 years,
with three marvelous children.

1335
01:46:32,543 --> 01:46:37,913
And, as soon as my youngest left
to go to college, I took ajob.

1336
01:46:37,982 --> 01:46:40,041
ln an arts foundation.

1337
01:46:44,989 --> 01:46:46,923
I met a woman there.

1338
01:46:46,991 --> 01:46:49,653
Secretary in the grants office.

1339
01:46:54,999 --> 01:46:57,763
We became fast friends, and...

1340
01:47:02,540 --> 01:47:05,668
before long, I fell in love with her.

1341
01:47:10,181 --> 01:47:14,811
This came as quite a shock,
as you might imagine.

1342
01:47:15,053 --> 01:47:19,922
The more I tried to ignore it,
the more powerful it became.

1343
01:47:24,862 --> 01:47:28,593
You have no idea what it's like

1344
01:47:28,666 --> 01:47:33,160
to have your own thoughts
turn against you like that.

1345
01:47:33,271 --> 01:47:40,177
I couldn't talk to anyone about my situation
so I found other ways to cope.

1346
01:47:47,151 --> 01:47:50,177
I took up drinking.

1347
01:47:50,254 --> 01:47:54,190
Eventually, my husband left me.

1348
01:47:54,258 --> 01:47:56,749
Even my children fell away.

1349
01:47:59,163 --> 01:48:03,122
I came very close to ending it all.

1350
01:48:07,572 --> 01:48:13,670
It's just another reminder of how
little things have changed in our society.

1351
01:48:13,745 --> 01:48:18,842
What are you talking about?
Things have gotten much better.

1352
01:48:19,884 --> 01:48:22,352
What happened?

1353
01:48:22,420 --> 01:48:24,411
Why, you did, of course.

1354
01:48:24,489 --> 01:48:31,520
After I read your book, I realized how many
other women were in the same situation.

1355
01:48:31,596 --> 01:48:34,861
I mustered the courage to talk to my friend.

1356
01:48:34,932 --> 01:48:40,131
And she told me, to my great surprise,

1357
01:48:40,204 --> 01:48:43,662
that the feelings were mutual.

1358
01:48:43,741 --> 01:48:48,110
We've been together
for three happy years now.

1359
01:49:06,297 --> 01:49:08,231
You saved my life, sir.

1360
01:49:17,575 --> 01:49:22,569
Just one more question.
You've just told me your entire history.

1361
01:49:22,647 --> 01:49:28,017
Childhood, family, career,
every person you've ever had sex with.

1362
01:49:28,086 --> 01:49:31,351
But there hasn't been
a single mention of love.

1363
01:49:31,622 --> 01:49:34,989
That's because it's impossible
to measure love.

1364
01:49:35,059 --> 01:49:39,428
And, as you know, without measurements,
there can be no science.

1365
01:49:39,497 --> 01:49:43,433
But, I've been thinking a lot
about the problem lately.

1366
01:49:43,501 --> 01:49:44,729
''Problem?''

1367
01:49:45,636 --> 01:49:49,868
When it comes to love,
we are all in the dark.

1368
01:49:49,941 --> 01:49:53,968
So, you do think it matters?

1369
01:50:01,486 --> 01:50:05,149
- What time's our flight, Mac?
- Not for a couple of hours.

1370
01:50:05,223 --> 01:50:07,316
Let's stop in the woods.

1371
01:51:10,354 --> 01:51:11,753
Mac?

1372
01:51:14,625 --> 01:51:17,958
I'm right here, Prok.

1373
01:51:21,332 --> 01:51:26,031
Just imagine,
these trees are over 1000 years old.

1374
01:51:26,103 --> 01:51:29,937
Hence the name, Sequoia sempervirens,

1375
01:51:30,007 --> 01:51:34,910
''Always green.'' Always alive.

1376
01:51:40,084 --> 01:51:44,180
Mac, did I ever tell you about the Mbeere?

1377
01:51:44,288 --> 01:51:47,416
No, not that I recall.

1378
01:51:48,259 --> 01:51:50,591
They're an ancient East African tribe.

1379
01:51:50,661 --> 01:51:53,960
They believe that trees are imperfect men,

1380
01:51:54,065 --> 01:51:56,795
eternally bemoaning their imprisonment.

1381
01:51:56,867 --> 01:52:00,735
The roots that keep them
stuck in one place.

1382
01:52:03,541 --> 01:52:07,534
But I've never seen a discontented tree.

1383
01:52:07,612 --> 01:52:13,278
Look at this one,
the way its roots are gripping the ground.

1384
01:52:13,351 --> 01:52:16,718
I believe it really loves it.

1385
01:52:26,097 --> 01:52:27,257
Come on, Mac.

1386
01:52:30,201 --> 01:52:31,691
What's the hurry?

1387
01:52:31,769 --> 01:52:34,203
There's a lot of work to do.

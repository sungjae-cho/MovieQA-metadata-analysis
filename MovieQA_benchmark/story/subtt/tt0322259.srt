1
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:44,699
Go! Go!

2
00:01:09,169 --> 00:01:11,899
Yo, Jimmy, man,
give me the status.

3
00:01:11,971 --> 00:01:14,098
Tell me we good.
We got it, man.

4
00:01:14,174 --> 00:01:18,634
Beautiful.
It's gonna be
an all-timer tonight.

5
00:01:22,682 --> 00:01:25,708
All right,
all right, all right.
Fire 'em up!

6
00:01:25,785 --> 00:01:27,776
We go live in five.

7
00:01:27,854 --> 00:01:32,484
It's time for ignition
and straight automobile pimp.

8
00:01:32,559 --> 00:01:34,993
Let's do it, man.
Let's go.

9
00:02:03,256 --> 00:02:05,724
Ow, girl!
Sorry! My bad!

10
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:13,699
All right, ladies!
We're good!

11
00:02:13,766 --> 00:02:16,496
We're good.

12
00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:19,094
That's it, babies.

13
00:02:20,773 --> 00:02:23,071
Come on, Tej.
Let's get this race going!

14
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:25,634
Whoa, whoa, man.
Wait a second, man.

15
00:02:25,712 --> 00:02:28,112
You cats are first wave, man.
Where's your fourth at?

16
00:02:28,181 --> 00:02:33,016
Yo, it was Joaquin, but he had
to work the graveyard shift.
What?

17
00:02:33,086 --> 00:02:36,783
<i>Graveyard shift, man?</i>
Yo, why don't you
run with us, Tej?

18
00:02:36,856 --> 00:02:40,053
Hell, no, I'm not runnin'
with y'all, man.

19
00:02:40,126 --> 00:02:42,492
Either you find a fourth
or you don't race.

20
00:02:42,562 --> 00:02:44,587
- How 'bout that, huh?
- We should find two...

21
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:47,132
so we don't have to roll
with skirt here.

22
00:02:48,801 --> 00:02:51,031
Oooh!
<i>Idiota.</i>

23
00:02:51,104 --> 00:02:54,665
Whoa. Whoa.
Wait a second.

24
00:02:54,741 --> 00:02:58,541
Why don't I just find y'all
a fourth and we settle
this on the streets, huh?

25
00:02:58,611 --> 00:03:00,806
- Bring him on.
- Anybody I want?

26
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:03,371
No matter who it is.

27
00:03:03,449 --> 00:03:06,646
Yeah.

28
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:13,282
Yeah.
Yeah, man.
You wanna race tonight?

29
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:16,089
- Yeah. You know
I could use the money.
- You got four minutes.

30
00:03:16,162 --> 00:03:18,824
All right. I'll be there.

31
00:03:46,192 --> 00:03:48,990
The race starts
in four minutes.

32
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:52,464
All right, girls.
Let's do this.

33
00:04:03,042 --> 00:04:06,808
You think
you gonna win baby?
What you think?

34
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:08,938
You better.
We got rent to pay.
I know this.

35
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:37,807
I'll get you when
you get a car worth racing.

36
00:04:45,485 --> 00:04:48,579
Yeah. There's
our fourth right there.

37
00:04:48,655 --> 00:04:51,089
Shit. It's Brian.

38
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:17,445
<i>Yeah, Brian!</i>
<i>I love you, Bullet!</i>

39
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:21,817
What's up, Tej?
What's happenin', dude?

40
00:05:21,888 --> 00:05:24,948
Thanks for the invite.
No problem at all, man.
Just, uh--

41
00:05:25,024 --> 00:05:27,117
Just remember me
when you wax, a'ight?

42
00:05:28,861 --> 00:05:33,059
They got deep pockets?
Real deep.

43
00:05:35,201 --> 00:05:37,396
- What's up, Suki?
- What's up, Bullet?

44
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:40,268
- What do you say
we kick it a nickel?

45
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,706
Nobody said nothin'
about raisin' the stakes.

46
00:05:49,115 --> 00:05:51,913
If that's the case,
why don't you ask
these nice people here...

47
00:05:51,984 --> 00:05:54,714
to back off the line
so you can go home?
<i>Oooh!</i>

48
00:05:56,656 --> 00:05:58,590
Hey. Hey. Hey.

49
00:06:04,831 --> 00:06:08,198
Okay. Thirty-five large.

50
00:06:08,267 --> 00:06:11,998
Three <i>cinco</i>.

51
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:19,978
Thirty-five large, huh?

52
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:22,981
Either that or you
can go home, brah.

53
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:25,279
Yeah.

54
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,751
- It's all there.
- <i>It better be.</i>

55
00:06:30,823 --> 00:06:33,348
Damn, Suki.
Uh, when you gonna
pop my clutch, huh?

56
00:06:33,426 --> 00:06:36,327
As soon as you
get the right
set of tools.

57
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:38,921
Yeah, a'ight.

58
00:06:58,017 --> 00:07:00,383
All right, back up.
Back up. Let's go. Let's go.

59
00:07:00,453 --> 00:07:02,387
Whoa!

60
00:07:02,455 --> 00:07:04,446
Back y'all asses up.
Back up. Back up.

61
00:07:04,524 --> 00:07:06,651
<i>Before you turn</i>
<i>into barbecue around here.</i>

62
00:07:06,726 --> 00:07:08,990
<i>It's not a game.</i>
<i>This is serious.</i>

63
00:07:09,061 --> 00:07:11,825
<i>All right. Back up. Back up.</i>
<i>Get off the street.</i>

64
00:07:11,898 --> 00:07:13,832
Let's go. Back it up.
Back it up.

65
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:16,368
Everybody keep your hands
real, real clear, all right?

66
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:18,461
'Cause I got a surprise
for y'all this evening.

67
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:25,403
Go, Slap Jack!
Go, baby!
I got this. I got this.

68
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,880
Ready.

69
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:37,047
Ready.

70
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:38,055
Ready.

71
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:39,386
Ready.

72
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:41,256
Go!

73
00:08:32,778 --> 00:08:35,269
Oh, hell, no!

74
00:08:39,151 --> 00:08:40,914
Aaah!

75
00:08:43,723 --> 00:08:45,486
Aha!

76
00:08:49,128 --> 00:08:51,596
You ain't passin' me, dawg.
You ain't passin' me. Come on!

77
00:08:54,567 --> 00:08:56,432
What you got, man?

78
00:09:01,974 --> 00:09:03,737
I told you
you weren't gonna pass me.

79
00:09:17,089 --> 00:09:19,284
- Move, bitch!
- Ha!

80
00:09:34,941 --> 00:09:36,272
<i>¡Pendeja!</i>

81
00:10:04,537 --> 00:10:08,337
Uh-uh. Not tonight, baby.

82
00:10:08,407 --> 00:10:10,807
Bend over, boy.

83
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:15,679
Damn, girl!

84
00:10:26,592 --> 00:10:28,719
Last turn. Last turn.

85
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:32,525
Oh, too wide!

86
00:10:43,275 --> 00:10:45,368
Home stretch, baby!

87
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:54,950
Whoo-h-h-hoo!
Let it go, dawg!

88
00:11:13,939 --> 00:11:15,406
Yes!

89
00:11:26,652 --> 00:11:28,620
I can smell you!

90
00:11:29,288 --> 00:11:31,381
Yo, Jimmy,
hit it, baby. Hit it!

91
00:11:35,995 --> 00:11:38,964
A'ight. Y'all see that?

92
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:41,090
<i>Told y'all</i>
<i>I had a surprise.</i>

93
00:11:41,167 --> 00:11:43,727
How you like that
for a finale?

94
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:54,005
Bridge.

95
00:12:25,544 --> 00:12:28,172
- Oh!
- Whoo-hoo!

96
00:12:36,055 --> 00:12:38,683
Yeah!

97
00:12:41,861 --> 00:12:43,624
Shit!

98
00:12:51,871 --> 00:12:54,567
Huh? Oh, hell, no!

99
00:12:58,144 --> 00:13:00,738
Whoo! Smack that ass!

100
00:13:24,937 --> 00:13:26,871
Yes!

101
00:13:35,781 --> 00:13:38,841
Tell me y'all saw that, man.
Bullet and Suki sprayed
the bridge,

102
00:13:38,918 --> 00:13:41,716
and I need to start
making y'all pay
to see this shit.

103
00:13:41,787 --> 00:13:44,984
I got over 10 stacks
for my man right here, a'ight?

104
00:13:45,057 --> 00:13:48,151
That's what
I'm talkin' about, man.
Play with it.

105
00:13:48,227 --> 00:13:50,718
Smells good, don't it?
Yeah, I'll buy that.
Right there.

106
00:13:50,796 --> 00:13:53,196
Right. Y'all see this?
Everybody take
a real good look.

107
00:13:53,265 --> 00:13:56,530
This what you call
mutual respect.
A'ight, let's clear out.

108
00:13:56,602 --> 00:13:59,093
Anybody down
for another race?

109
00:14:00,973 --> 00:14:03,305
Shit!

110
00:14:06,178 --> 00:14:09,147
Hey, uh, make sure
you bring that body
by the garage later, a'ight,

111
00:14:09,215 --> 00:14:13,549
so, you know,
we can work on
that front end of yours.

112
00:14:13,619 --> 00:14:17,749
Watch out.
'Cause maybe I will.

113
00:14:17,823 --> 00:14:19,757
Yeah.

114
00:14:19,959 --> 00:14:21,824
What's up, man?

115
00:14:23,729 --> 00:14:27,392
Hey, where you going?

116
00:14:27,466 --> 00:14:30,196
It's time
to get out of here.
Why's that?

117
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:58,829
Oh, shit!

118
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:06,727
Nissan Skyline. Got him.

119
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:19,380
Shit! Shit!

120
00:15:27,626 --> 00:15:29,059
Shit--

121
00:15:35,868 --> 00:15:36,892
Shit.

122
00:15:41,073 --> 00:15:43,268
Damn!

123
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:51,849
Let me see your hands!
Put 'em up!

124
00:15:52,985 --> 00:15:55,010
<i>This is him. We got him.!</i>

125
00:16:06,432 --> 00:16:11,836
So, how long you been
in south Florida?
A while.

126
00:16:11,904 --> 00:16:13,929
Before that?

127
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:19,604
We know you're
Brian O'Conner,
formerly of the L.A.P.D.

128
00:16:19,678 --> 00:16:21,908
- You've got the wrong guy.
- Really?

129
00:16:26,452 --> 00:16:29,353
<i>How you doin', O'Conner?</i>

130
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:34,793
Let's take a walk.

131
00:16:36,261 --> 00:16:39,094
<i>Carter Verone.</i>
<i>Born in Argentina.</i>

132
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:41,598
But he's lived
most of his life in Miami.

133
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:45,398
Now he owns
the biggest import/export
business in the state.

134
00:16:45,471 --> 00:16:48,736
<i>Unfortunately, the cartels</i>
<i>have been successful</i>
<i>getting drugs into Miami.</i>

135
00:16:48,807 --> 00:16:50,866
But they've had
a hard time gettin'
the cash out.

136
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:54,037
We've been
surveilling him for a year,
but we've never been able...

137
00:16:54,113 --> 00:16:56,047
to put him
and the money together.

138
00:16:56,115 --> 00:16:58,447
- We've swept his house,
his warehouses--
- Nothing.

139
00:16:58,517 --> 00:17:02,283
Customs here has done
a great job of getting us
this far.

140
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:04,618
I'm just here to help get
them over the top.

141
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:06,624
I was able to get
an agent in undercover...

142
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:08,922
working travel
and logistics for him.

143
00:17:08,994 --> 00:17:12,088
Recently, Verone put her
in charge of finding
some new drivers.

144
00:17:12,164 --> 00:17:16,294
Right. Although we can't
confirm her status right now.
You think she's flipped?

145
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:19,667
She's one of mine.
She's all right.

146
00:17:19,738 --> 00:17:23,333
She's been in with Verone
nearly a year. Even lives
at the compound with him now.

147
00:17:23,409 --> 00:17:26,572
Look, it was the F.B.I.'s idea
to bring you in here.

148
00:17:26,645 --> 00:17:29,011
I'm against it. But we need
some good drivers...

149
00:17:29,081 --> 00:17:31,311
<i>that can put this asshole</i>
<i>and his money together.</i>

150
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:33,317
You're gonna roll
with Agent Dunn here.

151
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:35,819
And if I don't?

152
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:39,654
Well, here's a list
of the laws you broke in L.A.

153
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:42,592
Obstruction of justice,
aiding and abetting.
You know the rap sheet.

154
00:17:42,661 --> 00:17:47,325
Now, we can make this
all go away in the interest
of justice,

155
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:50,129
if you're willing
to play ball.
Yeah.

156
00:17:52,604 --> 00:17:56,597
So what's the idea here?
Dunn and I are supposed
to be street racers?

157
00:17:56,675 --> 00:17:58,973
That's right.

158
00:18:03,182 --> 00:18:05,116
So, Dunn--

159
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,254
Looks like we're gonna
be partners, bro.

160
00:18:10,322 --> 00:18:13,621
Could you tell me right quick
what would be a better motor
for my Skyline,

161
00:18:13,692 --> 00:18:15,592
a Gallo 12 or a Gallo 24?

162
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:21,891
Um--
The 24.

163
00:18:23,001 --> 00:18:25,299
I didn't know
pizza places made motors.

164
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,640
See, man, come on.
I can't do this.

165
00:18:30,709 --> 00:18:32,802
Seriously,
if this is what
you're gonna give me,

166
00:18:32,878 --> 00:18:35,039
I may as well
take my chances in Chino.

167
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:38,709
<i>We will</i>
<i>get someone else.</i>

168
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:40,979
<i>No way, man.</i>

169
00:18:42,354 --> 00:18:46,415
The only way I'll do this is
if I get to pick the driver.

170
00:18:46,492 --> 00:18:50,292
All right, O'Conner,
who you got in mind?

171
00:18:50,362 --> 00:18:52,762
This dude I grew up with
in Barstow.

172
00:18:52,831 --> 00:18:56,267
Who's that?
Roman Pearce.

173
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:17,254
Hi-oh! What--

174
00:19:20,058 --> 00:19:22,925
- That's your boy
in the Monte Carlo?
- <i>Yeah, that's him.</i>

175
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:27,125
Yeah, he's got some skills.
Mm-hmm.

176
00:19:27,199 --> 00:19:30,168
And he's crazy as hell,
I'm telling ya.

177
00:19:30,235 --> 00:19:32,863
In a good way though.
He's the man for the job.

178
00:19:38,277 --> 00:19:42,213
He's got quite a record,
including three years upstate.

179
00:19:42,281 --> 00:19:46,479
Says here he's on
house arrest now. Can't go more
than 100 yards from his home.

180
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:11,002
<i>Roman Pearce!</i>

181
00:20:11,076 --> 00:20:13,169
<i>Whoo-hoo!</i>

182
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:26,924
He always said
he'd be famous.

183
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:34,024
<i>Pearce!</i>

184
00:20:34,099 --> 00:20:36,932
Roman Pearce!

185
00:20:37,002 --> 00:20:40,494
- Yo, whatever happens next,
just let it go.
- I ain't in it.

186
00:20:42,374 --> 00:20:44,365
Rome!

187
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:55,011
Only my homeboys
call me Rome, pig!

188
00:20:59,691 --> 00:21:02,751
- I'm not a cop anymore, bro.
- Is that true?

189
00:21:04,529 --> 00:21:08,465
- Blondie here's
not a cop anymore?
- That's true. No badge.

190
00:21:19,211 --> 00:21:21,839
Whoo! Here we go.

191
00:21:32,991 --> 00:21:36,358
You still fight like shit.
You still fight like shit--

192
00:21:37,529 --> 00:21:39,554
<i>You better chill.</i>

193
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:42,361
What the hell
are you doin' here, O'Conner?
I'll choke you.

194
00:21:42,434 --> 00:21:44,527
I told you
to stay away from--

195
00:21:48,674 --> 00:21:51,939
You should've told me.
I did three years, Brian.

196
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:54,240
I told you
it wasn't my fault.

197
00:22:03,722 --> 00:22:05,781
Why did you
come here, O'Conner?

198
00:22:09,628 --> 00:22:11,755
I got a deal for you.

199
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:18,398
When I needed your ass,
you were nowhere to be found.

200
00:22:19,938 --> 00:22:22,133
Now you tryin'
to hand out deals?

201
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:27,370
I need you
to come to Miami
and drive with me.

202
00:22:27,446 --> 00:22:30,813
If you do, they'll take off
that anklet and they'll
clear your entire record.

203
00:22:30,882 --> 00:22:33,942
I did three years in jail.

204
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:36,078
Three years in jail
off you, Brian.

205
00:22:36,154 --> 00:22:38,486
I know you better
than you think.

206
00:22:38,557 --> 00:22:40,821
Maybe you don't.
Maybe you don't.

207
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:44,685
You guys finished?

208
00:22:44,763 --> 00:22:46,822
This deal legit?

209
00:22:46,898 --> 00:22:49,696
That's right, if you
do this job for us.

210
00:22:49,768 --> 00:22:52,259
Told you.
Shut up, punk.

211
00:22:53,839 --> 00:22:57,741
So you gonna clean
my record and get this
thing off my ankle?

212
00:22:57,809 --> 00:23:02,940
That's right. I thought you
couldn't wander more than
100 yards from your home.

213
00:23:03,014 --> 00:23:05,505
Why do you think
I'm parked so close
to the derby?

214
00:23:05,584 --> 00:23:07,643
Man, quit playin' like
you gonna pass this up.

215
00:23:40,652 --> 00:23:42,586
Wait. Hold up.

216
00:23:44,523 --> 00:23:46,923
Hey, bro,
what's going on?

217
00:23:46,992 --> 00:23:49,859
I don't know
if I should be
trusting you, man.

218
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:55,058
Just think of it this way.
It's an opportunity
for a fresh start.

219
00:23:55,133 --> 00:23:57,658
Let's just go do this.
I wouldn't need
a fresh start...

220
00:23:57,736 --> 00:24:02,105
if it weren't for you.
Man, you been using that
since the day you got busted.

221
00:24:02,174 --> 00:24:05,940
Now, let's just chill out
and go do this.
I don't need to chill out.

222
00:24:06,011 --> 00:24:09,276
Yes, you do. And you
need to stop blaming me
for your every mistake.

223
00:24:09,347 --> 00:24:12,646
And Roman Pearce needs
to start taking responsibility
for his own actions.

224
00:24:12,717 --> 00:24:16,380
You need to go to hell.
And you need
to go back to Barstow.

225
00:24:19,024 --> 00:24:21,492
I'm not goin'
back to Barstow.

226
00:24:31,603 --> 00:24:35,334
<i>Brian O'Conner,</i>
<i>Roman Pearce,</i>
<i>meet Monica Fuentes.</i>

227
00:24:35,407 --> 00:24:38,001
- Do they have
background on Verone?
- They've been briefed.

228
00:24:38,076 --> 00:24:40,544
Good. All right,
here's the deal.

229
00:24:40,612 --> 00:24:43,604
Verone's looking for drivers.
I've arranged for
both of you to join up.

230
00:24:43,682 --> 00:24:46,207
I've also hired some thugs.
You know, to make it legit.

231
00:24:46,284 --> 00:24:48,616
- When do we start?
- Right now.

232
00:24:48,687 --> 00:24:52,919
What are we drivin'?

233
00:24:53,925 --> 00:24:56,120
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

234
00:24:57,696 --> 00:25:00,631
Don't even think about
takin' the convertible.

235
00:25:00,699 --> 00:25:02,826
It might
loosen your mousse.

236
00:25:02,901 --> 00:25:05,631
No, that's cool.
That's too much
chrome for me anyways.

237
00:25:05,704 --> 00:25:10,300
Damn! Where you all confiscate
these rims from, man?

238
00:25:10,375 --> 00:25:12,843
Check in with us
after you meet him.

239
00:25:14,746 --> 00:25:17,806
You gonna have any problems
with these two knuckleheads?
I can handle 'em.

240
00:25:17,883 --> 00:25:21,614
They give you any trouble
at all, you let me know.
Thanks, Markham.

241
00:25:24,422 --> 00:25:26,822
I'll ride with you,
cowboy.

242
00:25:26,892 --> 00:25:31,261
Why she gotta ride with you.
You get the convertible.
Let's go.

243
00:25:44,175 --> 00:25:46,109
Turn right here.

244
00:25:51,082 --> 00:25:54,483
So you used to be a cop?
Yeah.

245
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:56,487
How long you been under?

246
00:25:56,555 --> 00:25:59,023
I lost track.

247
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:01,024
You all right?

248
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:06,489
You might wanna keep
your eyes on the road, playboy.

249
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:09,796
What, you think
we're gonna crash?
I haven't decided yet.

250
00:26:14,706 --> 00:26:16,173
What are you doin', Brian?

251
00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:28,450
He did the "stare and drive"
on you, didn't he?

252
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:30,954
He got that from me.

253
00:27:04,589 --> 00:27:08,025
Once we get in here,
you're on your own.

254
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:20,665
Look at that one.

255
00:27:20,739 --> 00:27:24,505
Hey, where did you
get them cars, the bottom
of a cereal box?

256
00:27:24,576 --> 00:27:28,273
Eh! Real funny, Fonzie.

257
00:27:29,814 --> 00:27:31,406
Ass.

258
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:34,281
Roberto, Enrique,
I need pictures of
the drivers,

259
00:27:34,352 --> 00:27:37,082
their license plates,
their cars, and anything else
you can find.

260
00:27:49,801 --> 00:27:51,928
Let's go.

261
00:27:54,439 --> 00:27:57,340
Keep your mouth shut
and follow my lead, all right?

262
00:27:57,409 --> 00:28:00,503
I got this.
No, I'm serious now.

263
00:28:01,846 --> 00:28:03,780
Handle your business.
I'll handle mine.

264
00:28:07,886 --> 00:28:10,184
Watch your hands, brah.

265
00:28:12,724 --> 00:28:15,750
Go in line.
Let's go.

266
00:28:24,502 --> 00:28:26,561
Carter.

267
00:28:33,445 --> 00:28:35,606
Drivers are here.
Good.

268
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:38,342
Come on.

269
00:28:41,186 --> 00:28:43,711
Stay.

270
00:28:47,759 --> 00:28:51,456
Thank you for coming
on such short notice.

271
00:28:51,529 --> 00:28:56,296
My red Ferrari was confiscated
yesterday, and it sits in
an impound lot in Little Haiti.

272
00:28:56,367 --> 00:28:58,460
It's about
20 miles from here.

273
00:28:58,536 --> 00:29:03,030
The car isn't important.
What is important is the package
I left in the glove box.

274
00:29:03,108 --> 00:29:07,977
<i>The first team back here</i>
<i>with the package will have</i>
<i>an opportunity to work for me.</i>

275
00:29:08,046 --> 00:29:11,538
- What, we gotta audition?
- Nobody's got a gun
to your head.

276
00:29:14,052 --> 00:29:16,179
That's it.

277
00:29:16,254 --> 00:29:19,417
<i>Driver's licenses.</i>
<i>Pass 'em up.</i>

278

Before Christmas, guys.
Go!

279
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:27,330
Go! Go, man.
Come on. Go!

280
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:48,480
Come on, cuz.

281
00:29:51,756 --> 00:29:53,883
All right,
let's see what
this thing can do.

282
00:30:10,308 --> 00:30:13,038
<i>Agent Markham,</i>
<i>I've got 'em</i>

Yeah, I got it.

284
00:30:15,113 --> 00:30:17,274
They're running.
What a surprise.

285
00:30:27,859 --> 00:30:30,089
Come on. Stick with me, Rome.
What you got?

286
00:30:38,269 --> 00:30:41,033
Why must I chase the cat?

287
00:30:54,352 --> 00:30:56,946
Smart ass.

288
00:31:01,659 --> 00:31:05,117
- Oh, yeah? You think
you're the bomb, Rome?

289
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:46,935
Let's see if
you still got it, Brian.

290
00:31:48,339 --> 00:31:50,603
All right, Rome.
I got somethin'
for your ass.

291
00:31:56,681 --> 00:31:58,979
Watch this, bro.

292
00:32:07,292 --> 00:32:09,317
Shit.

293
00:32:09,394 --> 00:32:11,726
Yeah, Rome.
How do you like
them apples?

294
00:32:11,796 --> 00:32:14,356
Show off!

295
00:32:14,432 --> 00:32:17,731
That's the Brian O'Conner
school of driving
right there, baby.

296
00:32:21,272 --> 00:32:23,137

297
00:32:23,207 --> 00:32:25,072
Oh, shit!

298
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:53,396
- Hey, man.
- Huh?

299
00:32:58,109 --> 00:32:59,599
<i>Get yourself on</i>
<i>outta the street!</i>

300
00:32:59,677 --> 00:33:02,009
<i>Boy, that's some</i>

302
00:33:15,693 --> 00:33:17,627
That's good.
Show me his partner.

303
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:24,760
Cars. Cars.
Where are the cars?

304
00:33:29,774 --> 00:33:33,301
Stinkin' boats.
Where are the cars?

305
00:33:42,553 --> 00:33:44,817
I need the cars.
Where are the cars at?

306
00:34:15,319 --> 00:34:17,583
Look in the center.
Look in the center.
What?

307
00:34:20,258 --> 00:34:23,659

- Don't let 'em get away.
- Not a problem.

00:34:40,111 --> 00:34:42,773
Sit on it, Fonzie!

311
00:34:42,847 --> 00:34:44,508
What the hell?

312
00:34:45,349 --> 00:34:47,283
Aw, shit! Cops.

313
00:34:47,351 --> 00:34:50,286
- What the hell

- <i>Rome, no!</i>

314
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:56,655
Time to go.

315
00:34:59,897 --> 00:35:02,923

Nice. Come on.

00:35:55,453 --> 00:35:58,183
Hmm.
What you checking
her out for?

323
00:35:58,256 --> 00:36:00,884
I'm not
checking her out.

324
00:36:03,928 --> 00:36:06,920
Yes, you were.
No, I wasn't.

325
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:10,627
I seen you
checkin' her out, man.
Okay, I was. Now shut up.

326
00:36:10,701 --> 00:36:13,192
You shut up.
Don't tell me to shut up.

327

00:36:40,665 --> 00:36:42,656
No, no, no.
Sit down.

333
00:36:43,968 --> 00:36:45,993
Nice Ferrari
you got in the driveway.

334
00:36:47,805 --> 00:36:50,137
I'm glad you like it.

335
00:36:54,879 --> 00:36:56,847
Darlin',
will you hold that?

336
00:37:04,989 --> 00:37:07,856
We did all that
for a damn cigar?

337
00:37:07,925 --> 00:37:10,519
No, you did that
for a job.

338
00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:21,467
Do you really think
that I would let
somebody impound my car?

339
00:37:25,276 --> 00:37:27,972
The boatyard's mine.
Oh, by the way,

340
00:37:28,045 --> 00:37:30,673
you two owe me a gate.

341
00:37:30,748 --> 00:37:34,047
- But I'll just
take it off your cut.

342
00:37:35,219 --> 00:37:37,346
Off our cut. Yeah.

343
00:37:37,421 --> 00:37:40,822
- I like that.
- Good.

344
00:37:40,891 --> 00:37:42,825
What's this job
you got for us anyway?

345
00:37:42,893 --> 00:37:44,690
Come with me.

346
00:37:44,762 --> 00:37:47,060
The house has ears in it.

347
00:37:48,666 --> 00:37:52,067
I have something I want you
to carry from North Beach
to the Keys.

348
00:37:52,136 --> 00:37:55,264
What is it?
Just put in the car
what I tell you to,

349
00:37:55,339 --> 00:37:58,035
drive it to me
and don't let anyone
stop you, understand?

350
00:37:58,109 --> 00:38:00,771
Yeah. Any chance
of cop trouble?

351
00:38:00,845 --> 00:38:06,579
No. I'm buying you
a window of time, but it's
not gonna be open very long.

352
00:38:06,651 --> 00:38:09,279
You make it,

353
00:38:09,353 --> 00:38:13,187
and I'll personally hand you
100 G's at the finish line.

354
00:38:13,257 --> 00:38:15,817
Make it 100 G's
a piece, <i>papi</i>.

355
00:38:17,662 --> 00:38:22,395
Look, man, obviously,

356
00:38:22,466 --> 00:38:24,400
your pockets
ain't nervous.
Hey, hey, hey.

357
00:38:24,468 --> 00:38:26,936
Don't ever touch me.

358
00:38:27,004 --> 00:38:30,201
Ours are empty.

359
00:38:30,274 --> 00:38:33,766
Like I said,
we hungry.

360
00:38:42,186 --> 00:38:44,746
I got an idea.

361
00:38:44,822 --> 00:38:48,417
<i>Why don't you two boys</i>
<i>join us at the club</i>
<i>a little later tonight?</i>

362
00:38:48,492 --> 00:38:52,121
- Yeah. Pearl at midnight?
- We'll get to know
each other a little better.

363
00:38:52,196 --> 00:38:54,357
All right.
Sounds good.

364
00:38:54,432 --> 00:38:57,128
We'll see you tonight.
See ya.

365
00:39:00,705 --> 00:39:02,639
Hey, you!

366
00:39:04,809 --> 00:39:07,141
Your pockets aren't empty.

367
00:39:07,211 --> 00:39:09,805
- Damn.
- I'll take my cutter back.

368
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:19,148
Stupid ass.

369
00:39:19,223 --> 00:39:23,455
Hey, man,
I figured you
had, like, 12 or 13--

370
00:39:23,527 --> 00:39:26,428
You're not too bright,
are you?
Just get out of here.

371
00:39:26,497 --> 00:39:28,988
Same old Rome
doin' the same old
stupid shit.

372
00:39:29,066 --> 00:39:32,968
Get off me, man.
What, runnin' your mouth?
Insultin' people?

373
00:39:33,037 --> 00:39:34,971
Stealin' Verone's shit?

374
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:37,269
Think I'm gonna let
somebody stare me down?

375
00:39:37,341 --> 00:39:40,208
I didn't let nobody
stare me down in jail,
homeboy.

376
00:39:40,277 --> 00:39:43,405
Think I'm gonna
let it fly on a beach?

377
00:39:43,481 --> 00:39:46,314
And you, I'll take
my cutter back.

378
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:48,443
His rich ass.

379
00:39:48,519 --> 00:39:51,181
And you're packin'!
Like you ain't?

380
00:39:52,723 --> 00:39:54,657
Exactly.

381
00:39:54,725 --> 00:39:58,422
- From here, I do the talkin'.
- Looks like you wanna do
a little more than that.

382
00:39:58,496 --> 00:40:00,430
Oh, and what's that
supposed to mean?

383
00:40:00,498 --> 00:40:04,594
It means you always
gettin' in trouble
over a female, Brian.

384
00:40:15,546 --> 00:40:18,572
Man, Tej's garage is ridiculous.
He's got the best of everything.

385
00:40:18,649 --> 00:40:23,086
Snap-on tools. All these lifts
are brand-new. They're only
maybe a couple months old.

386
00:40:23,154 --> 00:40:25,054
Hey, yo, Jimmy.
What's up, man?

387
00:40:25,122 --> 00:40:27,056
<i>What up, Bullet?</i>
That's Rome right there.

388
00:40:27,124 --> 00:40:29,285
When you get a second,
I want you to check out...

389
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:31,658
the Evo and the Spyder
and make sure
everything's copecetic.

390
00:40:31,729 --> 00:40:33,663
Evo? Where'd you get
an Evo from?

391
00:40:33,731 --> 00:40:35,995
Well, it's
a long story.
I got you, man.

392
00:40:36,066 --> 00:40:38,000
All right,
thanks, Jimmy.
Come check this out.

393
00:40:38,068 --> 00:40:40,969
It's so hot and humid
out here, I can't even
wear no drawers.

394
00:40:41,038 --> 00:40:44,872
Yeah, tell me about it.
Look at all
this potential out here.

395
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:48,704
Don't do that, man.

396
00:40:54,952 --> 00:40:57,648
Damn!

397
00:41:04,261 --> 00:41:06,195
Damn. Baby.

398
00:41:07,765 --> 00:41:10,632
Girl, you know
your boy can help
you put that fire out.

399
00:41:10,701 --> 00:41:12,999
Look at the bubble
on that--

400
00:41:13,070 --> 00:41:15,402
That's cool.
That's serious right there.

401
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:18,499
You're making me lose money.
Don't do that to me right now.

402
00:41:18,576 --> 00:41:21,739
I cannot take that right--
Come on, Ray! Do it!

403
00:41:21,812 --> 00:41:23,905
Hey, Tej Parker,

404
00:41:23,981 --> 00:41:26,575
Roman Pearce.

405
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:29,585
Come on, baby--
Basically, he's the man
to know in Miami.

406
00:41:29,653 --> 00:41:31,712
He's got his finger
in absolutely everything.

407
00:41:31,789 --> 00:41:33,723
It's just
the way it is.

408
00:41:33,791 --> 00:41:35,725
What's goin' on, Suki?
What's up, baby?

409
00:41:35,793 --> 00:41:37,954
How you doing?
I'm good.
How you doing?

410
00:41:38,028 --> 00:41:42,089
<i>What's this?</i>
<i>What's the latest?</i>
It's a work in progress.

411
00:41:42,166 --> 00:41:44,794
<i>It's not finished yet.</i>
That's some artistic shit.

412
00:41:44,869 --> 00:41:47,565
You got talent, girl.
Yeah, she's good.
She's the best.

413
00:41:47,638 --> 00:41:51,597
Do or die. Bring it home, Ray.
Bring it home, Ray.
Bring it home. Bring it home.

414
00:41:51,675 --> 00:41:54,303
Yeah, baby! Pay up!
Pay up! Pay up!

415
00:41:54,378 --> 00:41:57,609
That's how they
do it out here, man?

416
00:41:57,681 --> 00:42:00,115
Every day.
That's crazy.

417
00:42:00,184 --> 00:42:03,017
Right here, right now.
What's up, man?
You don't look too happy.

418
00:42:03,087 --> 00:42:06,716
A'ight? Expeditiously, man.
I need it quick right here.
What's up?

419
00:42:06,790 --> 00:42:10,521
Thank you.
Thank you. All right.
How you feeling? A'ight?

420
00:42:10,594 --> 00:42:12,619
A'ight.
Thank you.
Thank you, man.

421
00:42:13,697 --> 00:42:17,189
Not too bad.
Whoo!

422
00:42:17,268 --> 00:42:21,227
I'll see you
about your money, homey.
You race too?

423
00:42:21,305 --> 00:42:23,398
No, man.

424
00:42:23,474 --> 00:42:26,841
I hit a wall doin',
like, a buck 20
couple years ago, you know?

425
00:42:26,911 --> 00:42:29,539
Ever since then,
I just been organizing
and collecting, man.

426
00:42:29,613 --> 00:42:32,343
Tej, check it out.
He's gonna be in town
for a while.

427
00:42:32,416 --> 00:42:35,078
Is there anyway
he could use that cot?

428
00:42:35,152 --> 00:42:37,086
What's wrong
with your place, man?

429
00:42:37,154 --> 00:42:41,250
No, I don't
wanna stay with him.
He got bad habits.

430
00:42:41,325 --> 00:42:43,850
A'ight, man.
Whatever, man.

431
00:42:43,928 --> 00:42:46,624
Show him around
real quick, a'ight?
I'll be up there in a minute.

432
00:42:46,697 --> 00:42:49,257
Thanks.

433
00:42:49,333 --> 00:42:51,324
A'ight, who want a chance
to win their money back?

434
00:42:52,836 --> 00:42:56,294
What's up, Jimmy?
So you ever seen
anything like this before?

435
00:42:56,373 --> 00:42:59,467
No. Both of them
are wired up
like I never seen before.

436
00:42:59,543 --> 00:43:02,603
What?
Yeah, man. They got us
wired with G.P.S.

437
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:06,639
That's why Markham
knew we were gonna be
at that impound lot.

438
00:43:06,717 --> 00:43:10,949
Yo, you the master mechanic.
Why don't you just yank
that shit up out of there?

439
00:43:11,021 --> 00:43:13,353
I'll try, but
this ain't Lo Jack.

440
00:43:13,424 --> 00:43:16,882
<i>The D.I.S. box,</i>
<i>the engine management system,</i>
<i>hell, the main harness--</i>

441
00:43:16,961 --> 00:43:18,895
The G.P.S. is spidered
into all of that.

442
00:43:18,963 --> 00:43:22,899
Hey, tell me somethin', man.
Do I even want to know
where the Skyline is, dawg?

443
00:43:22,967 --> 00:43:24,958
<i>Or where you been</i>
<i>the past couple of days?</i>

444
00:43:25,035 --> 00:43:28,493
Or where the hell
you got these rides from?
They're hot.

445
00:43:28,572 --> 00:43:32,030
Yeah, they hot. They wired
so hot that whoever's trackin'
these things will know...

446
00:43:32,109 --> 00:43:34,043
<i>every time you don't</i>
<i>wear your seat belt.</i>

447
00:43:37,548 --> 00:43:39,743
All right, Jimmy,
just do what
you can do, bro.

448
00:43:39,817 --> 00:43:42,149
- I got ya.
- Thanks, man.

449
00:43:42,219 --> 00:43:44,585
Man, we need to get
these on the street ASAP.

450
00:43:46,256 --> 00:43:48,190
Hey, bro,
check it out.

451
00:43:48,258 --> 00:43:50,658
You see that Cadillac
across the street
over there?

452
00:43:54,164 --> 00:43:58,760
Yeah.
Yeah, well, they've been on us
since we left Verone's house.

453
00:44:08,145 --> 00:44:12,514
Elian and Fidel!

454
00:44:12,583 --> 00:44:14,551
Hey, man, I'll clean
your windshield for you.

455
00:44:14,618 --> 00:44:16,779
What are you doin', man?

456
00:44:16,854 --> 00:44:19,254
<i>Uno, tres, cuatro,</i>
"fourtro," taco.

457
00:44:19,323 --> 00:44:22,884
<i>Everything's copecetic, homey.</i>

458
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:25,793
Kiss my ass, <i>putos</i>.

459
00:44:25,863 --> 00:44:27,763
Shit!

460
00:44:29,366 --> 00:44:31,027
Let's go!
Let's go! Let's go!

461
00:44:37,341 --> 00:44:40,242
He's gonna blow our cover
before we even get started.

462
00:44:40,310 --> 00:44:43,677
Hey, Bilkins, can you
tell me what went wrong?
That's what I wanna know.

463
00:44:43,747 --> 00:44:45,806
Show me your hands!
Come on. Keep 'em up!

464
00:44:45,883 --> 00:44:47,748
- What's this about, man?
- Hey, w-what's goin' on?

465
00:44:47,818 --> 00:44:51,652
Hold this.
You think you can shoot at me?
I'm a goddamn federal agent!

466
00:44:51,722 --> 00:44:55,783
What are you talkin' about?
Get your damn hands off me!
Get him away from me!

467
00:44:55,859 --> 00:44:59,226
<i>Just 'cause you wear a badge</i>
<i>don't mean you can come in</i>
<i>and mess shit up!</i>

468
00:44:59,296 --> 00:45:02,060
- Get your hands off of me!
- You're lucky
I didn't shoot you.

469
00:45:02,132 --> 00:45:04,760
- Shut up, Rome!
- Don't tell me
to shut up, Brian!

470
00:45:04,835 --> 00:45:06,632
You almost blew our cover,
old man.

471
00:45:06,704 --> 00:45:09,104
You shouldn't have
shown up like you did.

472
00:45:09,173 --> 00:45:11,300
What, you didn't know
Verone was testing us?

473
00:45:11,375 --> 00:45:13,673
- No. I thought you punks
were running.
- Running!

474
00:45:13,744 --> 00:45:15,735
That's great.
That's real great!

475
00:45:15,813 --> 00:45:20,147
Oh, and if Rome wanted
to shoot you, you wouldn't
be here right now.

476
00:45:20,217 --> 00:45:22,151
All right.
We gotta get this
under control.

477
00:45:26,056 --> 00:45:28,490
<i>Hey, that's mine!</i>

478
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:32,427
- So?
- So tell me what you know.

479
00:45:32,496 --> 00:45:35,090
Well, Rome and I will be
making a run for Verone.

480
00:45:35,165 --> 00:45:38,760
I'm not sure when and where.
But he did say
he bought us a window.

481
00:45:38,836 --> 00:45:40,394
I'm assuming
from the local cops.

482
00:45:40,471 --> 00:45:43,406
I can talk to
some of the guys
at the local P.D.

483
00:45:43,474 --> 00:45:46,602
No. No good. If Verone's got
some of them on the payroll,

484
00:45:46,677 --> 00:45:48,702
<i>then we can't let them know</i>
<i>our operation.</i>

485
00:45:48,779 --> 00:45:51,247
Exactly. In addition,

486
00:45:51,315 --> 00:45:54,978
Verone told us that he himself
would be waiting at the drop.

487
00:45:55,052 --> 00:45:58,453
That's good news.
If you're gonna be
delivering drug money to him,

488
00:45:58,522 --> 00:46:02,151
- then we can get him
for laundering.
- No, there's only one problem.

489
00:46:02,226 --> 00:46:06,026
- What's that?
- Fuentes--
Verone's tappin' her.

490
00:46:06,096 --> 00:46:09,293
Tappin' her?
Tappin' her how?
That is crap!

491
00:46:09,366 --> 00:46:11,800
What you talkin' about,
homeboy? We know what we seen.

492
00:46:11,869 --> 00:46:14,702
What do you think, O'Conner?
You think she's compromised?

493
00:46:14,772 --> 00:46:17,468
- <i>You should know.</i>
- What's that supposed to mean?

494
00:46:17,541 --> 00:46:20,476
What? You mean your old pal
O'Conner didn't tell ya?

495
00:46:20,544 --> 00:46:24,241
He flipped on Bilkins in L.A.
Gave his mark his car keys
and let him disappear.

496
00:46:24,314 --> 00:46:26,908
<i>That's why he's not</i>
<i>a cop anymore.</i>

497
00:46:28,252 --> 00:46:30,880
<i>So what do you think, expert?</i>

498
00:46:32,122 --> 00:46:34,056
Man, I don't know.

499
00:46:34,124 --> 00:46:36,649
All right.
We'll keep an eye on her.

500
00:46:38,128 --> 00:46:40,596
We're out of here.

501
00:46:46,670 --> 00:46:50,629
You let your man go, huh?
Drop it. I don't
wanna talk about it.

502
00:46:50,707 --> 00:46:53,835
Drop it, hell!
I wanna hear
about this, homey.

503
00:46:53,911 --> 00:46:55,435
I said forget about it, cuz.

504
00:46:55,512 --> 00:47:00,609
We got Fuentes in with Verone,
Markham tryin'
to blow our cover...

505
00:47:00,684 --> 00:47:04,848
and we got two wired cars
that are no better than that
damn ankle bracelet of mine.

506
00:47:04,922 --> 00:47:08,881
I'm-a tell you, brah.
You let your man Markham do that
shit again in front of Verone,

507
00:47:08,959 --> 00:47:11,450
- that's gonna be our ass.
- I know, man. I know.

508
00:47:11,528 --> 00:47:14,292
It's gettin' thick real quick,
and we may need a way out.

509
00:47:14,364 --> 00:47:16,958
- We gotta come up with
some exit strategy.
- Exit strategy, huh?

510
00:47:17,034 --> 00:47:19,025
Yeah.

511
00:47:20,304 --> 00:47:22,636
I like the way that sounds.
What you got in mind?

512
00:47:22,706 --> 00:47:26,142
I don't know, man.
But we need two more cars.

513
00:47:32,282 --> 00:47:35,308
Yeah. Here they come.

514
00:47:54,638 --> 00:47:58,472
Fonzie and Fabio.
Glad you can join us.

515
00:47:58,542 --> 00:48:01,409
We heard you boys
wanted to get rid
of those Cracker Jack toys.

516
00:48:01,478 --> 00:48:04,413
No. Actually we just figured
those cars you got
deserved better drivers,

517
00:48:04,481 --> 00:48:06,745
which is why we're gonna
take 'em off your hands.

518
00:48:06,817 --> 00:48:09,115
- You know, why don't
we settle this now?
- Wait, wait.

519
00:48:09,186 --> 00:48:11,450
How about we settle this
on the blacktop, huh?

520
00:48:11,521 --> 00:48:13,921
Each car does it
down and back,
tag-team style--

521
00:48:13,991 --> 00:48:17,119
<i>for slips.</i>
Loser walks home.

522
00:48:17,194 --> 00:48:19,355
- We came to race.
- Well, load 'em up then.

523
00:48:23,667 --> 00:48:25,635
Come on, bro.
Let's get these cars.

524
00:48:27,404 --> 00:48:30,965
All right, check it out.
There's no way we gonna beat
these guys straight up.

525
00:48:31,041 --> 00:48:33,407
The Hemi's puttin' out
about 425...

526
00:48:33,477 --> 00:48:37,174
and that Yenko
will snap a speed on
about five seconds flat.

527
00:48:37,247 --> 00:48:39,579
We're gonna have to pull
somethin' out of our ass.

528
00:48:39,650 --> 00:48:43,711
The only thing I can think of
is save the spray for
the way back, the return trip.

529
00:48:43,787 --> 00:48:46,187
Done deal.
All right.
Let's do this, bro.

530
00:48:46,256 --> 00:48:48,281
I'm gettin'
that orange one.

531
00:48:48,358 --> 00:48:51,885
You ain't ready, Fabio!

532
00:48:56,867 --> 00:49:01,668
All right. You each
got a barrel to go around
down at the end of the road.

533
00:49:01,738 --> 00:49:05,504
The second wave gotta
sit tight till your partner
crosses this line right here.

534
00:49:05,575 --> 00:49:08,567
First team to go
down and back twice
wins the race.

535
00:49:08,645 --> 00:49:11,739
At which point,

536
00:49:11,815 --> 00:49:15,478
the losers <i>will</i>
hand over them keys.

537
00:49:15,552 --> 00:49:19,648
Otherwise, you'll be eatin'
breakfast through straws
from now on.

538
00:49:19,723 --> 00:49:22,248
<i>¿Comprende?</i>

539
00:49:22,326 --> 00:49:24,260
I get it.

540
00:49:25,262 --> 00:49:27,924
Oh, this means you too.

541
00:49:27,998 --> 00:49:30,558
- I got it.
- A'ight.

542
00:49:30,634 --> 00:49:32,966
Let's race.

543
00:49:35,672 --> 00:49:39,039
<i>Come on, baby!</i>
<i>You got this, Rome.</i>
<i>Let's do it.</i>

544
00:49:39,109 --> 00:49:43,512
Hey, you gone, homey.
I got this. This is done.

545
00:49:43,580 --> 00:49:46,014
<i>You about to lose</i>
<i>your car.</i>

546
00:49:46,083 --> 00:49:47,846
Do it, Rome!
Come on.
You got it.

547
00:49:47,918 --> 00:49:50,716
You think I'm worried
about this fool, man?

548
00:49:50,787 --> 00:49:53,779
This is nothin'.

549
00:50:02,766 --> 00:50:04,893
- Aw, no.
- American muscle.

550
00:50:07,637 --> 00:50:11,334
Your engine ain't
as big as your mouth.

551
00:50:15,645 --> 00:50:18,546
Gotta smoke 'em. Gotta
smoke 'em. Gotta smoke 'em.

552
00:50:18,615 --> 00:50:21,675
All right, here we go.
It's all right, baby.
I'm gonna handle this.

553
00:50:21,752 --> 00:50:23,777
Handle it.

554
00:50:23,854 --> 00:50:26,482
Ready and... go!

555
00:50:33,196 --> 00:50:35,596
You ain't ready.
I run these streets.

556
00:50:43,140 --> 00:50:45,734
Woo-hoo!

557
00:50:45,809 --> 00:50:48,107
Romey Rome.
You ain't heard of me?

558
00:51:06,263 --> 00:51:08,094
Oh, shit.

559
00:51:12,436 --> 00:51:14,267
Oh, yeah!

560
00:51:18,675 --> 00:51:21,200
I'm-a get you.
Oh, I'm-a get you!

561
00:51:22,245 --> 00:51:24,145
Where's your
big mouth now, boy?

562
00:51:24,214 --> 00:51:26,011
That car's going home
with me, homey.

563
00:51:37,394 --> 00:51:39,385
Oh, shit.
Eat this, sucker!

564
00:51:53,743 --> 00:51:54,971
Shit!

565
00:51:59,149 --> 00:52:01,583
Yeah, boy!
Go, Korpi!

566
00:52:04,988 --> 00:52:07,980
Sorry, blondie.
How does that dust taste?

567
00:52:09,559 --> 00:52:11,550
I don't know.

568
00:52:11,628 --> 00:52:14,096
Come on, Rome.

569
00:52:42,626 --> 00:52:47,029
What the--
Good move, kid. Let's see
if you got the balls. Come on!

570
00:53:01,945 --> 00:53:04,539
Whoo!

571
00:53:10,554 --> 00:53:12,044
Goddamn! Come on!

572
00:53:21,565 --> 00:53:23,829
Come on, Brian.
Bring it home, man.

573
00:54:06,409 --> 00:54:09,378
Got two new cars!
That's all my man!

574
00:54:09,446 --> 00:54:12,279
Damn!

575
00:54:18,255 --> 00:54:20,951
Y'all ain't ready, homeboy.
Get to walkin', Fabio.

576
00:54:22,592 --> 00:54:25,891
<i>Use them bus tokens, partner!</i>

577
00:54:30,934 --> 00:54:33,402
Hey, how you doin'?

578
00:54:33,470 --> 00:54:35,802
Good. What you need?
We're guests
of Mr. Verone's.

579
00:54:46,049 --> 00:54:50,042
- It's a "hoasis"
in here, brah.
- <i>Yeah.</i>

580
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:55,558
Lots of potential.
Damn. You got a pen?

581
00:54:55,625 --> 00:54:59,925
Phew. It's about to
get serious, brah.

582
00:54:59,996 --> 00:55:03,397
<i>Look at that girl</i>
<i>on the swing right there.</i>

583
00:55:03,466 --> 00:55:05,457
Hey. You guys
did something right.

584
00:55:05,535 --> 00:55:09,938
- Verone never socializes
with hired help.
- Then what's that make you?

585
00:55:10,006 --> 00:55:12,600
- Where's he at?
- He's on his way.

586
00:55:12,676 --> 00:55:16,271
- You and Verone don't go
everywhere together?
- What's that supposed to mean?

587
00:55:16,346 --> 00:55:19,645
Nothin'.

588
00:55:19,716 --> 00:55:22,150
Huh. I'm-a go
take a piss.

589
00:55:22,218 --> 00:55:24,209
You go do that.

590
00:55:28,425 --> 00:55:32,759
What is his deal?
He doesn't trust people
that carry badges.

591
00:55:32,829 --> 00:55:35,525
So you talk
like you know.

592
00:55:35,598 --> 00:55:39,728
Yeah.
I'd been a cop
about two months...

593
00:55:39,803 --> 00:55:42,101
when Roman was busted
in a garage raid.

594
00:55:42,172 --> 00:55:45,699
He had eight sets of wheels
in his possession, each
and every one of them hot.

595
00:55:45,775 --> 00:55:49,905
So you busted him?
No. I didn't even know
what was goin' down.

596
00:55:49,979 --> 00:55:52,880
But, uh, that doesn't
really matter to him.

597
00:55:52,949 --> 00:55:55,440
Basically, once
I became a cop,

598
00:55:55,518 --> 00:55:57,918
Roman started
seeing me as a friend
that became the enemy.

599
00:56:00,857 --> 00:56:03,189
You have a little--

600
00:56:04,494 --> 00:56:07,156
Is there anything
I can get for you,
Mr. Verone?

601
00:56:07,230 --> 00:56:09,289
<i>Just tell 'em</i>
<i>to come join me.</i>

602
00:56:15,572 --> 00:56:17,563
Oh, yeah.
I was admiring this.

603
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:20,438
Yeah, I was looking
at it earlier.

604
00:56:27,650 --> 00:56:30,949
- Damn.
- I wasn't about
to give it to you.

605
00:56:31,020 --> 00:56:34,114
What's up?
He's here, man.

606
00:56:34,190 --> 00:56:37,284
Where's he at?
He's over there.
Don't look.

607
00:56:41,498 --> 00:56:45,195
Excuse me.
Mr. Verone would like
for you to join him.

608
00:56:45,268 --> 00:56:47,259
Let's do it.

609
00:56:47,337 --> 00:56:49,328
See what I'm talkin' about?

610
00:56:52,909 --> 00:56:54,934
It's all right.
Let 'em in.

611
00:56:57,347 --> 00:57:00,646
Go sit down.
I'll talk to you
in a second.

612
00:57:00,717 --> 00:57:02,844
How ya doin'?
Good. You enjoying
your night?

613
00:57:02,919 --> 00:57:04,910
Yeah. I'm havin'
a good time.
Good, good.

614
00:57:07,624 --> 00:57:10,787
She's beautiful,
isn't she?

615
00:57:14,197 --> 00:57:17,792
Hmm?
Yeah.

616
00:57:17,867 --> 00:57:19,858
She's gorgeous.

617
00:57:26,242 --> 00:57:28,870
You got balls, kid.

618
00:57:28,945 --> 00:57:31,413
I can appreciate that.

619
00:57:31,481 --> 00:57:35,247
Women are a very
powerful force.

620
00:57:35,318 --> 00:57:39,516
You see the blond
sitting with
the gentleman right here?

621
00:57:43,226 --> 00:57:47,856
Five minutes of her time,
and she can get anything
she wants from him.

622
00:57:47,931 --> 00:57:50,331
- I love your hair.
- Watch.

623
00:57:56,840 --> 00:57:59,365
I wonder where
they're going.
Sit down.

624
00:58:01,911 --> 00:58:05,506
So, you, uh, lit my man's
car on fire. Is that right?

625
00:58:07,116 --> 00:58:10,347
Yeah. I did.

626
00:58:12,422 --> 00:58:15,755
You see, I got a problem
with authority.

627
00:58:15,825 --> 00:58:20,194
Hmm. I have
that same problem.

628
00:58:20,263 --> 00:58:24,427
For me, it's cops
in particular.

629
00:58:36,546 --> 00:58:39,208
Let's take a walk.
Come on.
We just got here.

630
00:58:39,282 --> 00:58:41,273
Now we're leaving.

631
00:58:42,352 --> 00:58:44,343
Let's go.

632
00:58:51,694 --> 00:58:54,060
Hey. Come on.

633
00:59:16,419 --> 00:59:18,410
What's all that?

634
00:59:20,490 --> 00:59:23,653
We're gonna have
a little fun.

635
00:59:27,997 --> 00:59:30,465
- Hmm.
- <i>Thank you.</i>

636
00:59:34,637 --> 00:59:37,470
Let's just stay
a little longer.

637
00:59:37,540 --> 00:59:40,600
Hey, Carter.

638
00:59:40,677 --> 00:59:43,111
Meet, uh,
Detective Whitworth.

639
00:59:45,348 --> 00:59:49,910
One of Miami's finest.
Thank you, sweetheart.

640
00:59:49,986 --> 00:59:53,922
<i>Are you enjoying</i>
<i>yourself, Detective?</i>
Yeah. I was.

641
00:59:53,990 --> 00:59:56,652
I mean, you know me.

642
00:59:56,726 --> 00:59:59,661
Yeah, I do know you.

643
01:00:01,764 --> 01:00:05,131
- You been on my payroll
a long time.
- Verone, that ain't right.

644
01:00:05,201 --> 01:00:08,136
Shut up.

645
01:00:08,204 --> 01:00:11,332
I got one last job
for you, Detective.
You hear me?

646
01:00:11,407 --> 01:00:13,398
Look, we've been
all through this.
Yeah?

647
01:00:13,476 --> 01:00:16,445
Yeah. I said
I can't do it.

648
01:00:16,512 --> 01:00:20,346
Hmm. That's
the wrong answer.
The table.

649
01:00:24,654 --> 01:00:28,920
I'm a detective, Verone!
You do anything to me,

650
01:00:28,992 --> 01:00:32,257
the whole force is gonna
be on your ass
in a minute.

651
01:00:32,328 --> 01:00:35,820
Shut your mouth!
You fat piece of shit.

652
01:00:35,898 --> 01:00:37,729
You can stop right now.

653
01:00:43,673 --> 01:00:46,164
- What the hell--
What the hell is that?
- Sit down.

654
01:00:47,410 --> 01:00:49,776
You're gonna regret this.
Just stop right now!

655
01:00:49,846 --> 01:00:53,009
Once the bucket
gets hot enough,
Detective,

656
01:00:53,082 --> 01:00:55,414
the rat is gonna
want out.

657
01:00:55,485 --> 01:00:57,248
Get--

658
01:00:57,320 --> 01:01:00,187
And the only direction
it can go is south.

659
01:01:01,524 --> 01:01:04,425
Hey! Get--
Hey!

660
01:01:04,494 --> 01:01:06,291
Hold that.

661
01:01:06,362 --> 01:01:10,560
- Get it off me!
I'll forget it ever happened.
- Shut up.

662
01:01:10,633 --> 01:01:14,069
Did you know that
your average rat...

663
01:01:14,137 --> 01:01:17,129
<i>can chew through</i>
<i>a steel drain pipe?</i>

664
01:01:17,206 --> 01:01:20,607
You see, you have nothing
to worry about when he's
screaming, Detective.

665
01:01:20,677 --> 01:01:23,737
It's when he goes quiet
that he goes to work.

666
01:01:23,813 --> 01:01:26,577
<i>Stop it! Stop it!</i>
<i>Stop it!</i>

667
01:01:26,649 --> 01:01:29,982
Don't be stupid.
Stop it now.

668
01:01:30,053 --> 01:01:33,887
You're in charge of the units
that are watching
my properties, huh?

669
01:01:33,956 --> 01:01:36,322
<i>What I want is,</i>
<i>I want a 15-minute window...</i>

670
01:01:36,392 --> 01:01:38,826
where everybody--
and I mean everybody--
disappears.

671
01:01:38,895 --> 01:01:41,762
You hear me?
I can't do it!

672
01:01:44,067 --> 01:01:47,833
- <i>Stop it.</i>
<i>I can't do it. Help!</i>
- Okay. Monica, come here.

673
01:01:47,904 --> 01:01:51,305
- <i>Help! Help!</i>
- Shut him up.
Shut him up.

674
01:01:51,374 --> 01:01:54,400
Help! Help!

675
01:01:54,477 --> 01:01:56,342
<i>Help!</i>

676
01:01:56,412 --> 01:01:59,176
Help! Help!

677
01:01:59,248 --> 01:02:01,944
He's biting me!

678
01:02:02,018 --> 01:02:04,509
- <i>Help! Help!</i>
- What?

679
01:02:07,557 --> 01:02:09,923
- You got somethin'
you wanna say?

680
01:02:09,992 --> 01:02:12,586
He bit me!

681
01:02:12,662 --> 01:02:15,927
- <i>Yes, I'll do it!</i>
- Do what? Say it.

682
01:02:15,998 --> 01:02:18,193
I'll do it.
I'll give you your window.

683
01:02:18,267 --> 01:02:21,964
Just get it off me!

684
01:02:22,038 --> 01:02:25,439
Get it off!

685
01:02:25,508 --> 01:02:27,942
You betray me,

686
01:02:28,010 --> 01:02:30,672
and my rat here...

687
01:02:30,747 --> 01:02:32,977
is gonna visit
your wife, Lynn-- yeah--

688
01:02:33,049 --> 01:02:36,450
your son, Clay,
and your daughter, Lexi.

689
01:02:36,519 --> 01:02:39,317
Do you hear me?
You understand me? Huh?

690
01:02:39,388 --> 01:02:41,117
You hear me?
Yes.

691
01:02:41,190 --> 01:02:43,556
I'll burn your... eyes out!
I'll burn 'em out!

692
01:02:43,626 --> 01:02:46,652
Get it off me.

693
01:02:46,729 --> 01:02:50,722
Good. Now you can go.
Get it off me.

694
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:54,065
<i>Get rid of him.</i>
<i>Let's go.</i>
Get if off!

695
01:03:00,576 --> 01:03:03,875
Mm. You boys
enjoy the show?

696
01:03:05,581 --> 01:03:08,744
Fifteen minutes, and then
every cop in Florida
is gonna be on you.

697
01:03:08,818 --> 01:03:12,686
Be at Versailles Café,
6:00 a.m., day after tomorrow,
ready to drive.

698
01:03:12,755 --> 01:03:14,882
- You understand?
- Yeah.

699
01:03:14,957 --> 01:03:20,020
Don't play games with me,
or you'll be next. All right?

700
01:03:20,096 --> 01:03:23,395
Help yourself
to a little champagne.
Let's go.

701
01:03:26,402 --> 01:03:28,336
That was
a damn rat, man.

702
01:03:28,404 --> 01:03:30,395
Hey.

703
01:03:38,247 --> 01:03:42,980
You ever... touch
another man again,
and I'll kill you.

704
01:03:43,052 --> 01:03:46,283
You hear me?
Look at me.

705
01:03:46,355 --> 01:03:48,346
You hear me?

706
01:03:55,097 --> 01:03:58,157
She was into it, man.
What's that about?

707
01:03:58,234 --> 01:04:00,759
And you seen the way
she grabbed
the dude's head.

708
01:04:00,837 --> 01:04:03,601
She had to, man.
He was testing her.
You gotta remember,

709
01:04:03,673 --> 01:04:06,267
her ass is on the line,
just like ours.

710
01:04:06,342 --> 01:04:08,367
You feelin' this girl
way too much.

711
01:04:08,444 --> 01:04:12,175
She just like that
crazy-ass trailer-raff
from back-in-the-day, Tonya.

712
01:04:12,248 --> 01:04:16,617
Tonya? Man, you
went out with her
after I did.

713
01:04:16,686 --> 01:04:18,813
I mean, I couldn't
let her go to waste.

714
01:04:18,888 --> 01:04:20,947
I got you, I got you,
I got you.

715
01:04:21,023 --> 01:04:23,992
Is that right?
See, we can race
for cash,

716
01:04:24,060 --> 01:04:28,156
<i>but when I step on the gas,</i>
<i>my nitrous go blast,</i>
<i>leave your ass in the past.</i>

717
01:04:28,231 --> 01:04:31,826
And, Tej, you about
to lose your garage.
Whatever, man.

718
01:04:31,901 --> 01:04:34,995
<i>I'm a low-budget mechanic,</i>
<i>but I overcharge.</i>

719
01:04:35,071 --> 01:04:38,063
Pay me!
Let's go, man!

720
01:04:38,140 --> 01:04:40,131
Pay me my money.
I told you, man.

721
01:04:40,209 --> 01:04:42,200
You a happy man.
I'm so glad.

722
01:04:42,278 --> 01:04:44,371
This is my garage, boy.
Royal flush!

723
01:04:44,447 --> 01:04:46,506
Give me this, man.
Holler, huh! Yes!

724
01:04:46,582 --> 01:04:49,142
Did I talk to him?
Talk to him.
<i>Damn.</i>

725
01:04:49,218 --> 01:04:52,949
You can't play a player. Put
that money back on the table.
You know it's my next hand.

726
01:04:53,022 --> 01:04:55,786
Jimmy, how you
gonna pay me back
if you keep losing to Tej?

727
01:04:55,858 --> 01:04:57,917
How ya doin', bro?
I'm gonna crash, Tej.

728
01:04:57,994 --> 01:04:59,985
I'll catch you tomorrow.
A'ight, boy.

729
01:05:16,178 --> 01:05:19,170
- What are you doin' here?
- Brian, they're gonna
kill you.

730
01:05:19,248 --> 01:05:21,682
<i>I heard him telling</i>
<i>Enrique and Roberto.</i>

731
01:05:21,751 --> 01:05:25,517
Once you finish the run, they're
putting a bullet in your head.

732
01:05:25,588 --> 01:05:30,184
- You sure
you heard 'em right?
- I'm sure. I'm sure.

733
01:05:34,363 --> 01:05:38,527
Verone's boys is outs--

734
01:05:38,601 --> 01:05:41,570
<i>Oh, I see what</i>
<i>they lookin' for--</i>
<i>your little girlfriend here.</i>

735
01:05:47,410 --> 01:05:50,243
- They don't know I'm here.
I snuck out.
- What are they doin' here then?

736
01:05:50,313 --> 01:05:54,511
I don't know.
Maybe they're guessing.
Hey, go stall them.

737
01:05:54,583 --> 01:05:57,916
- Go stall them
for two minutes.
- Check her, homey. Check her.

738
01:06:02,792 --> 01:06:04,783
Find what you was
lookin' for?

739
01:06:09,432 --> 01:06:11,662
Hey, buddy. Hi, guys.
How ya doin'?

740
01:06:13,436 --> 01:06:16,098
Oh, man, y'all still mad
about y'all car?

741
01:06:16,172 --> 01:06:19,232
<i>Don't even trip, homey.</i>
<i>Come on, man.</i>
<i>You can't take a joke?</i>

742
01:06:19,308 --> 01:06:22,937
Brian, this isn't about
being a good cop anymore
or-or doing your job.

743
01:06:23,012 --> 01:06:25,071
They're gonna kill you.
You guys gotta pull out.

744
01:06:25,147 --> 01:06:27,274
Verone pay y'all to keep
a straight face like that?

745
01:06:27,350 --> 01:06:31,343
<i>'Cause if I was makin' money,</i>
<i>shit, I'd get that mole</i>
<i>removed off my damn nose.</i>

746
01:06:31,420 --> 01:06:33,752
Okay? Okay.
Yeah.

747
01:06:33,823 --> 01:06:35,848
How much
he pay y'all anyway?

748
01:06:35,925 --> 01:06:39,417
Every time I see y'all, man,
y'all got the silk shirts on,

749
01:06:39,495 --> 01:06:42,259
<i>jewelry, you know,</i>
<i>lookin' real Miami.</i>

750
01:06:42,331 --> 01:06:44,663
You know? I caught you
walkin' up in the club,

751
01:06:44,734 --> 01:06:49,068
you got the hamburger meat
all hangin' out, you know?

752
01:06:49,138 --> 01:06:52,039
Don't make that run, Brian.
Don't make that run.

753
01:06:52,108 --> 01:06:54,099
Be careful.

754
01:06:55,177 --> 01:06:57,873
- <i>¿Donde está?</i>
- <i>¿Quién?</i>

755
01:06:57,947 --> 01:07:00,848
You ain't comin' on my--

756
01:07:07,390 --> 01:07:10,359
Hey, hey! Where you goin'?
You stay right here
with us, buddy.

757
01:07:19,201 --> 01:07:21,635
Don't even think
about it.

758
01:07:32,982 --> 01:07:36,281
<i>¡Vámonos!</i>
Stay your ass off
my homeboy's boat.

759
01:07:43,059 --> 01:07:45,619
Put the gun down!
Put the gun down now!

760
01:07:45,694 --> 01:07:47,787
You first, asshole!
You first!

761
01:07:47,863 --> 01:07:50,195
I'll shoot the shit
outta him!
Put the gun down!

762
01:07:52,268 --> 01:07:54,998
<i>¡Tú primero!</i>

763
01:07:55,071 --> 01:07:57,096
Put down the gun now!

764
01:07:57,173 --> 01:07:59,801
Put down the gun!

765
01:07:59,875 --> 01:08:01,866
Enough.

766
01:08:01,944 --> 01:08:03,935
Enough. Shut up.

767
01:08:04,013 --> 01:08:07,210
Shut up.
It's over. Come on.

768
01:08:08,884 --> 01:08:11,182
<i>It's over. Let's go.</i>

769
01:08:11,253 --> 01:08:13,915
<i>Let's have the gun. Come on.</i>
<i>Let's go. Let's go.</i>

770
01:08:18,394 --> 01:08:21,659
I'm glad to see you boys
are getting along so well.

771
01:08:21,730 --> 01:08:24,756
<i>Because tomorrow,</i>
<i>Roberto and Enrique...</i>

772
01:08:24,834 --> 01:08:26,825
are gonna be
riding along with you...

773
01:08:26,902 --> 01:08:28,961
<i>just so that we don't</i>
<i>have any problems.</i>

774
01:08:29,038 --> 01:08:31,029
I'll see you guys
in a bit.

775
01:08:34,977 --> 01:08:37,468
What the hell was she
doin' in there, man?

776
01:08:47,890 --> 01:08:50,450
Where'd you go
this morning?

777
01:08:50,526 --> 01:08:52,517
I went to breakfast
with some friends.

778
01:08:58,501 --> 01:09:01,698
With friends.

779
01:09:01,770 --> 01:09:03,761
I do have friends, Carter.

780
01:09:10,946 --> 01:09:14,712
Okay.
I'll see you later.

781
01:09:24,660 --> 01:09:27,595
- Nice shirt, Bilkins.
- It's my day off.

782
01:09:27,663 --> 01:09:32,191
Yeah. Well, anyhow,
this is the deal.

783
01:09:32,268 --> 01:09:35,328
Last night,
Verone threatened a cop
into giving us a window.

784
01:09:35,404 --> 01:09:39,306
We're driving to an airstrip,
in the Keys,
off of Nallwood Avenue.

785
01:09:39,375 --> 01:09:41,843
Verone has a plane there,
and he's taking off
for good.

786
01:09:41,911 --> 01:09:44,778
- Wait a minute.
How do you know this?
- Monica.

787
01:09:44,847 --> 01:09:48,442
She's doin' her job.
She warned us.

788
01:09:48,517 --> 01:09:52,248
- She warned you about what?
- Verone plans to kill us
after we give him the money.

789
01:09:52,321 --> 01:09:55,119
Driving into an ambush
was never part of the deal.

790
01:09:55,191 --> 01:09:58,752
I'm calling this off.
<i>Like hell you are. This</i>
<i>is a Customs case, Bilkins.</i>

791
01:09:58,827 --> 01:10:01,694
<i>No one's calling this off</i>
<i>unless I do.</i>

792
01:10:01,764 --> 01:10:04,062
Look. This is real simple.

793
01:10:04,133 --> 01:10:06,158
You make the run.
You get Verone
and his cash together...

794
01:10:06,235 --> 01:10:08,169
so I can move in
for the bust.

795
01:10:08,237 --> 01:10:11,570
All right? You don't, I will
find enough charges on both
of you to make you disappear.

796
01:10:11,640 --> 01:10:14,575
Take these. We're gonna
have G.P.S. on you
the whole time...

797
01:10:14,643 --> 01:10:16,634
to make sure you don't
get any cute ideas.

798
01:10:16,712 --> 01:10:20,113
- And to make sure nothing
happens to them, right?
- Yeah, right.

799
01:10:29,391 --> 01:10:32,121
The guy's a dick, man.
Yep.

800
01:10:34,263 --> 01:10:36,458
Let me get this right.

801
01:10:36,532 --> 01:10:39,524
If we don't do this,
then we go to jail.

802
01:10:39,602 --> 01:10:42,594
But if we do it, then
Verone's gonna kill us.

803
01:10:42,671 --> 01:10:44,832
It's a hell of a deal,
huh?

804
01:10:44,907 --> 01:10:48,240
Yeah. Maybe it is.

805
01:10:50,212 --> 01:10:52,203
But I know this guy's
got an ass full of loot...

806
01:10:52,281 --> 01:10:54,943
that he's ready
to dump in our cars.

807
01:10:55,017 --> 01:10:58,976
And I can think of two reasons
why Verone doesn't need
that money anymore.

808
01:10:59,054 --> 01:11:01,716
- Ah, here we go.
- You and me.

809
01:11:01,790 --> 01:11:04,987
<i>Just like the old days.</i>
<i>What do you think?</i>

810
01:11:05,060 --> 01:11:08,518
I think they messed with
the wrong two guys.
That's what I think.

811
01:11:11,400 --> 01:11:13,630
Yo, Tej.
What's up, bro?
What up?

812
01:11:13,702 --> 01:11:15,829
Hey, man, how quickly
can you organize?

813
01:11:15,904 --> 01:11:18,065
Look, folk,
if y'all really wanna
carry out this plan,

814
01:11:18,140 --> 01:11:20,631
it's definitely
the best place to do it.

815
01:11:20,709 --> 01:11:24,167
What do y'all think, man?
I think it's perfect.
What do they store here?

816
01:11:46,802 --> 01:11:48,793
Hey, Jimmy.

817
01:11:48,871 --> 01:11:52,204
<i>Yeah. What up?</i>
We have any half-empty bottles
of nitrous laying around?

818
01:11:52,274 --> 01:11:54,834
Sure, but I already
loaded you for spray.

819
01:11:54,910 --> 01:11:57,140
No. I'm thinkin'
we may need it
for somethin' else,

820
01:11:57,212 --> 01:12:00,511
'cause our cars may get
a little crowded,
you know?

821
01:12:08,457 --> 01:12:10,448
Man, when you start
eatin' so much?

822
01:12:12,361 --> 01:12:14,488
I was in jail, brah.

823
01:12:14,563 --> 01:12:16,861
I know how shitty
the grub is
on the inside.

824
01:12:16,932 --> 01:12:20,424
With the way things is shapin'
up out here right now,

825
01:12:20,502 --> 01:12:24,165
it'll be a matter of time
before I'm back in there
or dead.

826
01:12:25,874 --> 01:12:28,468
So I'm tryin' to eat
all I can while I can.

827
01:12:30,546 --> 01:12:33,674
Plus the doctor tell me
I got a high metabolism.

828
01:12:38,153 --> 01:12:40,144
Man, you remember us
growing up?

829
01:12:40,222 --> 01:12:44,215
You know, playing
football in the dirt.

830
01:12:44,293 --> 01:12:46,659
You know, gettin' in trouble,
all the stupid things we did.

831
01:12:48,630 --> 01:12:51,997
When you got busted, you know,
whether I was a cop or not,

832
01:12:52,067 --> 01:12:55,093
you know, if there was
anything I could've done,

833
01:12:55,170 --> 01:12:58,901
I would've done it,
and I just want you
to know that.

834
01:13:00,409 --> 01:13:02,570
Is that why you let
that dude go in L.A.?

835
01:13:04,913 --> 01:13:06,904
Yeah. I think that had
a lot to do with it.

836
01:13:10,085 --> 01:13:13,816
When I got busted,
it wasn't your fault.

837
01:13:13,889 --> 01:13:18,519
<i>It was all on me,</i>
<i>Mr. Roman Pearce--</i>

838
01:13:18,594 --> 01:13:20,960
wild-and-out crazy, man.

839
01:13:21,196 --> 01:13:23,756
<i>No one can tell me</i>
<i>nothin'.</i>

840
01:13:23,832 --> 01:13:27,666
- Ridin' solo.
- Yeah, well, not anymore.

841
01:13:33,375 --> 01:13:35,366
Not anymore, bro.

842
01:14:00,736 --> 01:14:03,034
I got Verone's Navigator
leavin' the residence.

843
01:14:03,105 --> 01:14:06,939
Copy. Sir, we've got
Verone on the move
to the airstrip.

844
01:14:07,009 --> 01:14:10,206
Good. Let's get a bird
in the air. Tell him
to keep his distance.

845
01:14:12,448 --> 01:14:15,645
<i>Good and tight.</i>
<i>Ready to go.</i>
<i>Channel two. Channel two.</i>

846
01:14:15,717 --> 01:14:18,481
You're all set.
Thanks.

847
01:14:18,554 --> 01:14:21,216
All set?
Yep. Let's do it.

848
01:14:23,959 --> 01:14:26,086
Report.

849
01:14:27,429 --> 01:14:29,556
<i>What's goin' on out there?</i>

850
01:14:31,700 --> 01:14:33,827
- Team one checking in.
- Team two checking in.

851
01:14:33,902 --> 01:14:38,862
- Team three checking in.
- Team four.
All clear here too.

852
01:14:38,941 --> 01:14:40,932
Team five checkin' in.

853
01:14:41,009 --> 01:14:43,671
This is team six.
All clear.

854
01:14:47,983 --> 01:14:51,009
<i>Here we go.</i>
<i>Yeah, so you know what to do.</i>

855
01:14:51,086 --> 01:14:53,850
<i>Just stay cool,</i>
<i>keep focused.</i>

856
01:14:53,922 --> 01:14:56,220
Remember, the airstrip's
on Nallwood Avenue.

857
01:14:56,291 --> 01:14:58,282
It's the third exit
after the bridge.

858
01:15:00,128 --> 01:15:02,961
- Got it.
- So what up, man?
You ready for this?

859
01:15:03,031 --> 01:15:07,331
Come on, man.
Guns, murderers
and crooked cops?

860
01:15:07,402 --> 01:15:10,064
I was made for this, brah.

861
01:15:44,172 --> 01:15:47,403
<i>Come on.</i>

862
01:16:09,097 --> 01:16:13,056
I got activity at Verone's
trailer property.

863
01:16:13,135 --> 01:16:16,263
Do not move an inch
until I tell you to.

864
01:16:39,962 --> 01:16:41,452
<i>Load up.</i>

865
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:49,528
All units, move on
the trailer property
right now. Move!

866
01:16:56,211 --> 01:16:59,237
Shit! Local P.D.
is moving in
on our guys.

867
01:16:59,314 --> 01:17:02,044
Three bags in one car, huh?
Guess so.

868
01:17:15,163 --> 01:17:17,154
Cops.

869
01:17:20,435 --> 01:17:24,997
- I'm not goin' back to jail.
- Where you goin', man?
Let's go! Let's go!

870
01:17:25,073 --> 01:17:27,007
What is he doin'?

871
01:17:49,097 --> 01:17:52,533
<i>Okay, now let's get</i>
<i>the chopper over them.</i>
<i>I want eyes right on top.</i>

872
01:17:52,601 --> 01:17:56,367
You got it.
Lima 25, follow G.P.S.

873
01:18:05,380 --> 01:18:07,280
You know what
you're doin', man?

874
01:18:10,385 --> 01:18:12,319
Stay with me, Rome.
Stay with me.
Come on, man.

875
01:18:20,295 --> 01:18:23,753
<i>I've got 'em</i>
<i>heading south on I-95.</i>

876
01:18:23,832 --> 01:18:25,663
Bring in the aerial E.S.D.'s.

877
01:18:34,342 --> 01:18:36,902
Oh, shit!

878
01:18:39,881 --> 01:18:42,679
- They're catching up, man!
- Shut up, man!

879
01:18:54,896 --> 01:18:57,956
- Yeah, nice drivin', Rome.
Nice drivin'.
- I gotcha, Brian.

880
01:19:03,572 --> 01:19:05,563
Check it out, man!

881
01:19:17,452 --> 01:19:19,443
What was that?

882
01:19:29,564 --> 01:19:32,465
Oh, shit.

883
01:19:44,880 --> 01:19:47,041
- Come on, man.
Take the wheel.
- No. I can't drive.

884
01:19:47,115 --> 01:19:49,242
Just hold the wheel!
I can't drive!

885
01:19:49,317 --> 01:19:51,751
Hold it right there!
Just hold it steady,
just like that.

886
01:19:54,489 --> 01:19:56,514
What are you doin', man?

887
01:20:02,164 --> 01:20:03,426
<i>¿Qué pasa?</i>

888
01:20:49,711 --> 01:20:52,771
Whoo!
Yeah, man!

889
01:21:08,396 --> 01:21:10,387
Hold.

890
01:21:12,234 --> 01:21:14,498
Bilkins,
the bird's in place.

891
01:21:18,240 --> 01:21:22,506
<i>Yeah. We got</i>
<i>Verone's Navigator.</i>

892
01:21:22,577 --> 01:21:24,602
All right.
Money's in transit.
Sit tight.

893
01:22:10,558 --> 01:22:12,719
You're a good driver, man.

894
01:22:12,794 --> 01:22:14,557
Thanks, bro.

895
01:22:19,367 --> 01:22:23,463
<i>We've got the area</i>
<i>blocked ahead.</i>
<i>They've got nowhere to go.</i>

896
01:22:31,079 --> 01:22:33,639
Oh! What was that?

897
01:22:35,016 --> 01:22:38,008
<i>I've got a visual.</i>
<i>Video should be</i>
<i>coming through.</i>

898
01:22:38,086 --> 01:22:40,452
We got it.
Looks good.

899
01:22:41,990 --> 01:22:44,925
Where are they going?

900
01:22:52,300 --> 01:22:54,564
Oh, shit!

901
01:22:58,940 --> 01:23:01,602
All right, Miami's finest,
let's see what you got.

902
01:23:03,011 --> 01:23:05,571
Come on.
Stay with me, boys.

903
01:23:11,319 --> 01:23:14,777
- Hey, man. Everyone's here.
Time for the show.
- Let's give it to 'em.

904
01:23:19,761 --> 01:23:21,752
All right. Let the party
begin. Let's go.

905
01:23:40,382 --> 01:23:43,647
This is unit 2599.
We have the suspects
surrounded.

906
01:24:36,571 --> 01:24:38,198
Holy shit!

907
01:24:44,212 --> 01:24:47,545
It's a scramble, baby.
A big one!

908
01:24:52,420 --> 01:24:54,718
Yeah! Let's do this!

909
01:25:02,263 --> 01:25:05,858
Check this out!

910
01:25:12,107 --> 01:25:14,075
We're not tracking them
on video.

911
01:25:14,142 --> 01:25:16,007
Must have lost them
in the scramble.

912
01:25:16,077 --> 01:25:17,977
Y'all, let's break.

913
01:25:19,714 --> 01:25:20,874
Yeah!

914
01:26:03,591 --> 01:26:06,424
All right. We got 'em
going west on Beach.

915
01:26:06,494 --> 01:26:09,054
Roger that.
I've got 'em.

916
01:26:20,675 --> 01:26:24,133
Customs has a fix
on two cars going
west on Beach.

917
01:26:24,212 --> 01:26:27,477
Roger. Follow those cars.
Roger that.

918
01:26:50,071 --> 01:26:53,302
Shit.
They're cornered.

919
01:26:57,979 --> 01:27:00,914
<i>Keep your hands</i>
<i>where I can see 'em.!</i>

920
01:27:00,982 --> 01:27:04,418
- <i>Put your hands up!</i>
- Whoa. Fellas, fellas.

921
01:27:04,485 --> 01:27:06,919
I know my tags are
out of date, but, damn!

922
01:27:14,696 --> 01:27:18,632
What the hell?
Where are they?

923
01:27:39,554 --> 01:27:42,955
<i>Man!</i>
How about them apples,
man?

924
01:27:43,024 --> 01:27:47,484
Yeah! That's some drivin' for
your ass, baby! Ain't that
some drivin' for your ass?

925
01:27:47,562 --> 01:27:50,725
- Good job, man.
- Whatever, man.

926
01:27:50,798 --> 01:27:52,789
You supposed to be
a stone-face killer.

927
01:27:52,867 --> 01:27:54,858
You over there
grabbin' your seat belt.

928
01:27:54,936 --> 01:27:57,837
Hey, Tej. Thanks a lot.
You're the clutch.
I owe you one, big time.

929
01:27:57,905 --> 01:28:01,068
Yeah, Brian, you really
do owe me, man.

930
01:28:01,142 --> 01:28:05,408
You really do-- <i>Us</i>.
Suki says you owe us,
a'ight?

931
01:28:08,616 --> 01:28:11,517
- Yo, Rome. You there, man?
Come in.
- What's up, man?

932
01:28:11,586 --> 01:28:13,713
It looks like we got just
one more trick left, huh?

933
01:28:13,788 --> 01:28:15,756
My pleasure, buddy.
Let's do it, baby.

934
01:28:17,659 --> 01:28:21,493
Hey. We should grab Verone
while we still can.
No. Not yet.

935
01:28:22,997 --> 01:28:25,431
<i>What? You lost 'em?</i>

936
01:28:25,500 --> 01:28:28,833
Shit! Those little pricks
are running.

937
01:28:28,903 --> 01:28:31,269
- It's your call.
What do you want to do?
- We're gonna take him down.

938
01:28:31,339 --> 01:28:33,330
He is not leaving here.

939
01:28:33,408 --> 01:28:38,175
Enjoyin' the ride?
Man, it's a fast car, huh?

940
01:28:38,246 --> 01:28:41,079
Man, it's a classic.

941
01:28:41,149 --> 01:28:43,640
Old school.
American muscle.

942
01:28:45,787 --> 01:28:48,517
Man, this car can do
all kinda things, man.

943
01:28:48,589 --> 01:28:52,047
Wanna see?

944
01:28:52,126 --> 01:28:54,060
Check this out
right here, homey.

945
01:28:54,128 --> 01:28:55,959
Yo! What are you
doin', man?
Shut up!

946
01:29:04,205 --> 01:29:07,936
"Ejecto seato," cuz!

947
01:29:08,009 --> 01:29:11,137
<i>It worked!</i>
<i>I love this button!</i>

948
01:29:11,212 --> 01:29:15,740
<i>Stay on your toes,</i> puto!

949
01:29:15,817 --> 01:29:17,478
Mr. O'Conner,
it worked, baby.

950
01:29:17,552 --> 01:29:19,543
Blow and go.
I'm all clear.

951
01:29:19,620 --> 01:29:23,317
- Meet me at the point.
Hurry up, man. It's on, baby.
- All right. Ten-four, man.

952
01:29:23,391 --> 01:29:26,053
Are you ready?
Let's go!

953
01:29:33,134 --> 01:29:35,728
<i>I got this side!</i>

954
01:29:35,803 --> 01:29:38,101
Raise your hands!
Raise your hands!
Raise your hands!

955
01:29:38,172 --> 01:29:40,163
Get down! Get down!
Get down!

956
01:29:40,241 --> 01:29:42,835
<i>Clear!</i>
<i>We're clear!</i>

957
01:29:43,845 --> 01:29:45,836
<i>Back it up!</i>

958
01:29:48,149 --> 01:29:51,016
It's not Verone and Fuentes.
What do you mean?

959
01:29:51,085 --> 01:29:53,076
Then where the hell
are they?

960
01:30:00,027 --> 01:30:02,154
Get off at Tarpon Point.

961
01:30:02,230 --> 01:30:05,688
Tarpon Point? There's--
There's no airstrip
at Tarpon Point.

962
01:30:07,468 --> 01:30:10,266
Who said anything
about an airstrip?

963
01:30:23,451 --> 01:30:27,012
Brian. Brian, man,
what's the holdup, brah?

964
01:30:27,088 --> 01:30:29,682
- Yo, Rome,
there's a new plan.
- What the hell?

965
01:30:29,757 --> 01:30:33,284
We're meeting them at
the Tarpon Point exit,
not the airstrip.

966
01:30:33,361 --> 01:30:35,795
- So what are you sayin'?
- Like I said,
there's a new plan.

967
01:30:38,900 --> 01:30:42,165
Brian. Brian, hello?
You there?

968
01:30:45,139 --> 01:30:47,505
Damn!
Yo! What the hell
is he doin'?

969
01:30:47,575 --> 01:30:51,136
The feds are in the wrong place.
Brian's woman is on her own
with Verone.

970
01:30:51,212 --> 01:30:54,841
- So--
- So Brian's not comin'.

971
01:31:10,598 --> 01:31:12,691
- It's all right.
Let him out.
- Get out.

972
01:31:20,675 --> 01:31:22,836
Pop the trunk.

973
01:31:24,278 --> 01:31:26,269
Hurry up.

974
01:31:40,261 --> 01:31:43,355
- Where's the rest of it?
- The other car.

975
01:31:43,431 --> 01:31:46,764
- Another car.
Where's the other car?
- On its way.

976
01:31:46,834 --> 01:31:50,930
- On the way, huh?
- Yeah. Here's your money.

977
01:31:51,005 --> 01:31:54,372
So you know nothing
about the agents
that stormed my jet?

978
01:32:01,482 --> 01:32:04,246
The funny thing is that
I only told one person
about the airstrip.

979
01:32:17,965 --> 01:32:19,956
Hmm.

980
01:32:20,034 --> 01:32:23,595
Customs agents sure
are gettin' pretty,
aren't they?

981
01:32:26,641 --> 01:32:29,269
Put her on the boat.

982
01:32:31,412 --> 01:32:33,846
- Let's go.
- Get on the boat.

983
01:32:48,062 --> 01:32:50,860
- Hide the cars
and get rid of him.
- Back in the car.

984
01:33:19,794 --> 01:33:23,161
End of the road.

985
01:33:23,230 --> 01:33:26,688
You know, I like you,
but I still gotta kill you.

986
01:33:26,767 --> 01:33:29,167
It's my job.

987
01:33:29,236 --> 01:33:33,468
What's that?

988
01:33:33,541 --> 01:33:37,409
- What's that?
- It's Barstow, baby!
It's about to get ugly!

989
01:33:44,885 --> 01:33:47,217
Let's go.
Let's go.

990
01:34:03,104 --> 01:34:05,504
Get your--
Oh, shit!

991
01:34:23,157 --> 01:34:26,217
Come on.

992
01:34:50,384 --> 01:34:52,375
You had me.

993
01:34:53,888 --> 01:34:55,879
You slipped.

994
01:34:57,124 --> 01:34:59,115
Eleven and a half months,
and you slipped once.

995
01:35:01,295 --> 01:35:03,286
Put her downstairs.

996
01:35:09,804 --> 01:35:12,602
I'll see you
in a second.

997
01:35:16,977 --> 01:35:19,946
I thought you was dead, man.
Yeah. Me too. Thanks
for saving my ass, bro.

998
01:35:20,014 --> 01:35:22,642
What are you doin', Brian?
I don't know,

999
01:35:22,717 --> 01:35:25,015
<i>but if Verone sees a helicopter</i>
<i>or Customs boat, she's dead.</i>

1000
01:35:25,086 --> 01:35:26,917
<i>Boat. Car.</i>

1001
01:35:26,987 --> 01:35:31,083
<i>Boat-- You're not gonna do</i>
<i>what I think you're gonna do?</i>

1002
01:35:31,158 --> 01:35:34,321
- Yeah, I think so.
You got my back, bro?
- Yeah.

1003
01:35:34,395 --> 01:35:37,364
- Put on a seat belt.
- Show 'em some real
<i>Dukes of Hazzard</i> shit.

1004
01:35:37,431 --> 01:35:40,332
We're gonna do this big.
Hold on, Rome. Hold on.

1005
01:35:45,539 --> 01:35:50,806
<i>Oh! Brian, you crazy, man!</i>
<i>What the hell you doin'?</i>

1006
01:35:50,878 --> 01:35:53,369
- <i>Brian, what the hell</i>
<i>you doin'?</i>

1007
01:35:56,951 --> 01:35:58,441
Whoa!

1008
01:36:00,187 --> 01:36:02,052
Shit!

1009
01:36:13,601 --> 01:36:17,367
<i>My arm. I think</i>
<i>I broke my arm, man.</i>

1010
01:36:30,918 --> 01:36:33,079
Get the gun.

1011
01:36:52,439 --> 01:36:54,771
It's over, Carter.

1012
01:37:01,682 --> 01:37:04,082
- You okay?
- Yeah.

1013
01:37:05,252 --> 01:37:07,686
I'm great.

1014
01:37:12,193 --> 01:37:16,687
We got 'em, man.
We got 'em.

1015
01:37:16,764 --> 01:37:18,755
<i>Let's get outta here.</i>

1016
01:37:38,152 --> 01:37:40,143
Go! Go!

1017
01:37:49,263 --> 01:37:51,231
That ought to do it.

1018
01:37:51,298 --> 01:37:54,495
So, there were
three bags total, huh?
The three from the boat.

1019
01:37:56,136 --> 01:37:59,333
So we good, right?
My record's clean?

1020
01:37:59,406 --> 01:38:02,273
You held up your end.
Your records are clean.

1021
01:38:21,662 --> 01:38:24,722
So maybe
there was six bags.

1022
01:38:24,798 --> 01:38:27,062
I guess we can
call it even.

1023
01:38:27,134 --> 01:38:29,227
Agent Dunn.
Sir.

1024
01:38:32,773 --> 01:38:34,764
We found some
more evidence.

1025
01:38:36,644 --> 01:38:38,669
Come on.
Let's take it
to the truck.

1026
01:38:42,850 --> 01:38:45,648
Don't drop the soap,
big homey.

1027
01:38:47,288 --> 01:38:49,882
I hope you know
that when he gets out,
he's gonna kill your ass.

1028
01:38:51,725 --> 01:38:53,989
He ain't gettin' out.

1029
01:38:55,596 --> 01:38:59,157
- I'll see you soon.
- You think
he gonna get out?

1030
01:38:59,233 --> 01:39:01,633
He'll be out.

1031
01:39:01,702 --> 01:39:03,693
No, for real. You think
he gettin' out, though?

1032
01:39:05,072 --> 01:39:07,267
We took care
of your decoys.
They're free and clear.

1033
01:39:07,341 --> 01:39:09,502
There's a sedan
out on the road
for you.

1034
01:39:09,576 --> 01:39:13,910
<i>Try to bring it back</i>
<i>in one piece.</i>
Yeah.

1035
01:39:13,981 --> 01:39:17,348
- Thanks a lot, Bilkins.
You're all right.
- Thanks.

1036
01:39:17,418 --> 01:39:20,148
- Thanks for lookin' out, man.
- All right.

1037
01:39:21,388 --> 01:39:25,586
- So you trust me now?
- You a'ight.

1038
01:39:30,130 --> 01:39:33,657
Sorry.
Nice working
with you, O'Conner.

1039
01:39:33,734 --> 01:39:35,759
Same here.

1040
01:39:45,980 --> 01:39:49,074
Mm. I'm-a have to stay
out here in Miami, man.

1041
01:39:49,149 --> 01:39:51,709
Keep you out
of trouble, brah.

1042
01:39:53,654 --> 01:39:56,452
You know what
I'm talkin' about.

1043
01:39:56,523 --> 01:39:58,514
So you gonna kick it
in Miami, bro?

1044
01:39:58,592 --> 01:40:00,583
Oh, man,
I love Miami.

1045
01:40:00,661 --> 01:40:02,686
Miami's
off the hook.

1046
01:40:04,398 --> 01:40:08,858
Open a garage together.
A garage?

1047
01:40:08,936 --> 01:40:10,927
How we gonna
do that, brah?

1048
01:40:15,142 --> 01:40:17,406
Pockets ain't empty, cuz.

1049
01:40:21,081 --> 01:40:23,641
And we ain't hungry
no more either, brah.

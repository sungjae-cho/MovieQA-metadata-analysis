1
00:00:00,542 --> 00:00:32,397


2
00:01:13,592 --> 00:01:15,829
James McCullen, you Scottish pig,

3
00:01:16,329 --> 00:01:19,433
you've been found guilty of treason
for the sale of military arms

4
00:01:19,934 --> 00:01:22,737
to the enemies of our Lord,
King Louis XIII,

5
00:01:23,238 --> 00:01:26,275
even whilst you sold arms
to our Lord himself.

6
00:01:26,775 --> 00:01:32,681
Your king is a vile bag of filth
who murders his own allies.

7
00:01:33,182 --> 00:01:34,384
I should have charged him double.

8
00:01:34,885 --> 00:01:39,390
You tried to overthrow the Crown
in conspiracy with its enemies.

9
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:42,727
Unlike your simpleton king,
his enemies know

10
00:01:43,228 --> 00:01:47,166
that it is the true McCullen destiny
not simply to supply arms,

11
00:01:47,667 --> 00:01:48,868
but to run the wars!

12
00:01:49,368 --> 00:01:51,704
Do you have anything else to say
before the sentence is carried out?

13
00:01:52,204 --> 00:01:53,306
Yes, I do.

14
00:01:53,807 --> 00:01:55,776
Clan McCullen is far greater
and more powerful

15
00:01:56,276 --> 00:01:57,978
than any of you could ever imagine.

16
00:01:58,478 --> 00:02:02,016
My sons will continue to rise
long after I am gone,

17
00:02:02,517 --> 00:02:03,485
as will their sons

18
00:02:03,985 --> 00:02:06,388
and, God willing, their sons.

19
00:02:06,889 --> 00:02:09,058
It shall not end with my death!

20
00:02:09,558 --> 00:02:12,562
We are not going to kill you, McCullen.

21
00:02:13,063 --> 00:02:16,863
We're going to make an example of you!

22
00:02:18,269 --> 00:02:23,908
So that no man, woman nor child may
ever see your treacherous face again,

23
00:02:24,409 --> 00:02:27,947
you shall wear this mask
for the term of your natural life.

24
00:02:28,447 --> 00:02:32,315
No! No! No!

25
00:02:45,734 --> 00:02:47,836
For nearly 4 centuries,
my ancestors have been

26
00:02:48,337 --> 00:02:51,274
the greatest creators of weaponry
in the world.

27
00:02:51,774 --> 00:02:56,613
But perhaps in this century,
I'll outdo them all.

28
00:02:57,114 --> 00:02:58,182
Nanomites, perfect little soldiers

29
00:02:58,683 --> 00:03:01,453
originally developed
to isolate and kill cancer cells.

30
00:03:01,953 --> 00:03:02,887
But at MARS Industries,

31
00:03:03,387 --> 00:03:05,423
and with the help
of a little NATO funding,

32
00:03:05,924 --> 00:03:08,761
we discovered how to program them
to do almost anything.

33
00:03:09,261 --> 00:03:11,855
For example, eat metal.

34
00:03:12,632 --> 00:03:16,970
Watch this test
of the world's first nanomite warhead.

35
00:03:17,471 --> 00:03:20,375
Each of these warheads
contains 7 million nanomites

36
00:03:20,875 --> 00:03:24,479
and has the ability to eat anything
from a single tank

37
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:26,780
to an entire city.

38
00:03:29,352 --> 00:03:34,190
As you can see, it quickly converts
to eating any and all material in its path.

39
00:03:34,691 --> 00:03:38,329
Once unleashed,
the nanomites will not stop, ever.

40
00:03:38,829 --> 00:03:40,197
Once the target has been destroyed,

41
00:03:40,698 --> 00:03:43,068
the launcher triggers
a kill switch unique to each warhead

42
00:03:43,568 --> 00:03:47,472
that short-circuits the nanomites,
preventing any unwanted destruction.

43
00:03:47,973 --> 00:03:50,677
Gentlemen, I'm pleased to announce
that tomorrow morning,

44
00:03:51,177 --> 00:03:58,577
your first order of nanotech warheads
ships from my factory in Kyrgyzstan.

45
00:04:13,536 --> 00:04:18,836
Weapons case on the move.
ETA 2 minutes to NATO team.

46
00:04:27,118 --> 00:04:29,088
All right, listen up.
NATO wants the best of the best.

47
00:04:29,589 --> 00:04:31,825
That's why we're here.
We got Panthers front and back.

48
00:04:32,325 --> 00:04:33,259
RHINO's carrying the package
in the middle.

49
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:36,830
Minimum distance at all times.
Apaches are covering us from overhead.

50
00:04:37,331 --> 00:04:40,201
Detail, attention. Fall out, boys.

51
00:04:40,702 --> 00:04:42,571
Captain Hauser,
Mr. McCullen requires a signature.

52
00:04:43,071 --> 00:04:43,939
Not gonna explode, is it?

53
00:04:44,439 --> 00:04:46,408
They're not weaponized yet,
and the kill switches are inside.

54
00:04:46,909 --> 00:04:51,147
All the same,
I'd avoid potholes if I were you.

55
00:04:51,647 --> 00:04:52,682
-Hey, Bill?
-Yeah?

56
00:04:53,183 --> 00:04:56,153
Put that in the RHINO, would you?

57
00:04:56,653 --> 00:04:59,453
All right, ladies! Mount up!

58
00:05:16,276 --> 00:05:18,412
Okay, Apaches, we're heavy,
so keep your eyes open.

59
00:05:18,913 --> 00:05:23,813
Roger that.
Skies are clear all the way to Ganci.

60
00:05:30,293 --> 00:05:32,862
-Hey, Duke, I've been thinking.
-You know, I warned you about that.

61
00:05:33,362 --> 00:05:34,397
I've been thinking about
where we should transfer to.

62
00:05:34,898 --> 00:05:36,133
-Don't say the Air Force.
-The Air Force!

63
00:05:36,633 --> 00:05:38,469
What did I say? I thought
we were done with this conversation.

64
00:05:38,969 --> 00:05:40,137
You were done with this conversation,
not me.

65
00:05:40,638 --> 00:05:41,206
You know, I've been flying

66
00:05:41,706 --> 00:05:42,374
-since I was 13 years old.
-13 years old.

67
00:05:42,874 --> 00:05:47,312
You know, I don't think your dad's
crop-duster counts as hours logged.

68
00:05:47,813 --> 00:05:49,048
I'm talking jets, man. Jets.

69
00:05:49,548 --> 00:05:52,251
And you know I qualify
every time we're on leave.

70
00:05:52,752 --> 00:05:53,987
-You want to get up in the air?
-Yeah.

71
00:05:54,487 --> 00:05:58,559
-I'll buy you a trampoline.
-I filled out the application.

72
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:00,195
Really? They accept those in crayon?

73
00:06:00,695 --> 00:06:02,030
Come on, dude.
Give me one good reason why not.

74
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:09,330
'Cause I want to be on the ground,
in the fight, not flying over it.

75
00:06:18,082 --> 00:06:20,384
Pioneer 1, this is Pioneer 2,
going night vision.

76
00:06:20,884 --> 00:06:22,386
-Roger that.
-Go ahead and back off.

77
00:06:22,887 --> 00:06:24,289
Give me some separation.

78
00:06:24,789 --> 00:06:26,758
Pioneer 1, this is Pioneer 2. Going NVS.

79
00:06:27,258 --> 00:06:28,758
Roger.

80
00:06:31,163 --> 00:06:32,365
Hey, Duke,
weren't we supposed to meet up

81
00:06:32,865 --> 00:06:34,234
with the recon team at 40 klicks?

82
00:06:34,735 --> 00:06:39,335
-Yeah. So?
-Well, we just passed kilometer 41.

83
00:06:40,475 --> 00:06:42,978
-Eyes out, eyes out!
-Sweep's still clear, sir.

84
00:06:43,478 --> 00:06:47,778
Roger that.
There's nothing up here but us.

85
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:56,360
Tom, put a self-test on the flare
and start to scan for...

86
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:58,061
Holy...

87
00:06:58,562 --> 00:07:00,762
What the hell is that?

88
00:07:05,837 --> 00:07:08,537
Pioneer 1, you've been hit.

89
00:07:11,944 --> 00:07:13,444
Stop!

90
00:07:15,915 --> 00:07:17,484
-Bird down! Bird down!
-Back up! Back up! Back up!

91
00:07:17,985 --> 00:07:19,987
All units, we are under attack!
They're after the warheads!

92
00:07:20,487 --> 00:07:21,122
Pioneer 2, engage!

93
00:07:21,622 --> 00:07:27,061
-Put that asshole on the ground!
-Roger that. Put some hurt on this guy!

94
00:07:27,562 --> 00:07:31,062
Tommy guns. Firing, firing, firing!

95
00:07:32,868 --> 00:07:33,736
-Missiles armed.
-Match and shoot.

96
00:07:34,237 --> 00:07:37,237
Match and shoot! Missiles off!

97
00:07:39,943 --> 00:07:43,543
They shot them right out of the air.

98
00:07:45,049 --> 00:07:46,549
Oh, my God.

99
00:07:55,361 --> 00:07:57,064
-Pioneer 2 is down! We've lost our air!
-They're boxing us in!

100
00:07:57,564 --> 00:08:02,464
All units, fan out!
I repeat, all units, fan out!

101
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:15,880
I want SAMs on that thing!
Light him up! Light him up!

102
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:26,460
He's coming around.
Get those.50s on him!

103
00:08:30,769 --> 00:08:32,269
Incoming!

104
00:08:34,641 --> 00:08:36,141
Hold on!

105
00:08:40,414 --> 00:08:41,316
You okay?

106
00:08:41,816 --> 00:08:46,916
Yeah, but my leg is pinned.
What the hell was that?

107
00:09:32,741 --> 00:09:33,976
-Come on, we gotta get in this fight.
-Careful, my leg!

108
00:09:34,477 --> 00:09:39,677
Come on, buddy, let's go.
Let's go, get up, come on!

109
00:09:40,484 --> 00:09:41,953
Duke, you gotta go get those warheads!

110
00:09:42,453 --> 00:09:46,357
Shut up! I gotta get you out of here first!

111
00:09:46,858 --> 00:09:51,258
Fire at the opening!
Right side, right side!

112
00:09:55,068 --> 00:09:58,168
Get up, get up, get up, get up!

113
00:09:58,772 --> 00:10:00,272
My damn leg!

114
00:10:01,875 --> 00:10:02,877
-You wait here, okay?
-Where are you going?

115
00:10:03,377 --> 00:10:05,877
I gotta go get that case.

116
00:10:10,419 --> 00:10:12,119
Air Force, right.

117
00:10:14,023 --> 00:10:15,523
Don't move!

118
00:10:20,697 --> 00:10:23,063
-Hello, Duke.
-Ana?

119
00:10:25,136 --> 00:10:29,536
Now, you have to admit,
you had that coming.

120
00:10:39,452 --> 00:10:40,952
Ana!

121
00:10:43,357 --> 00:10:44,857
Ana!

122
00:11:19,232 --> 00:11:20,732
Bye-bye.

123
00:11:27,241 --> 00:11:29,471
Ana! Ana!

124
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,960
Don't make me shoot a woman.

125
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:49,166
Incoming!

126
00:12:11,093 --> 00:12:11,995
Stand down. Stand the hell down!

127
00:12:12,495 --> 00:12:14,330
-Put the weapon down, sir.
-We're not the enemy.

128
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:16,666
Pointing your weapons at me doesn't
make you my friend, now, does it?

129
00:12:17,167 --> 00:12:17,835
Please hand over the case, sir.

130
00:12:18,335 --> 00:12:20,404
I don't know you, and I sure as hell
don't know who they are,

131
00:12:20,904 --> 00:12:22,339
and until I find out,
I'm not lowering anything

132
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:23,675
and I ain't handing anything over.

133
00:12:24,175 --> 00:12:26,411
If it weren't for us, you'd be out there
with the rest of your boys.

134
00:12:26,911 --> 00:12:29,114
-So hand over the case.
-What's your unit?

135
00:12:29,615 --> 00:12:30,316
That's classified.

136
00:12:30,816 --> 00:12:35,116
Someone would like to have
a word with you.

137
00:12:37,624 --> 00:12:39,459
State your name and rank.

138
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,963
-You first.
-My team just saved your life, son.

139
00:12:42,463 --> 00:12:44,232
This is the part
where you get to say thank you.

140
00:12:44,732 --> 00:12:45,700
Those aren't the words
that come to mind right now.

141
00:12:46,201 --> 00:12:48,037
I wasn't told anything
about any support for this mission,

142
00:12:48,537 --> 00:12:49,571
so why don't you tell your team
to stand down?

143
00:12:50,071 --> 00:12:51,307
We could turn this
into one big turkey shoot.

144
00:12:51,807 --> 00:12:53,307
Yep.

145
00:12:54,277 --> 00:12:55,345
Or not.

146
00:12:55,845 --> 00:12:57,113
Easy, Ripcord.

147
00:12:57,613 --> 00:12:58,882
-How do you know me?
-Expert marksman,

148
00:12:59,383 --> 00:13:03,254
second in your battalion.
Weapons specialist, jet qualified.

149
00:13:03,754 --> 00:13:04,789
-I told you.
-Not now, Rip.

150
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:09,394
My name is General Clayton Abernathy.
Perhaps you've heard of me, Duke.

151
00:13:09,894 --> 00:13:12,364
General Hawk.
Afghanistan, NATO forward command.

152
00:13:12,865 --> 00:13:16,869
Yeah, that was my last job.
I'm in a whole new outfit now.

153
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:19,907
Hey, I just need to deactivate
the tracking beacon for security.

154
00:13:20,407 --> 00:13:23,711
Put down that weapons case, son,
and let us deliver those warheads.

155
00:13:24,212 --> 00:13:25,547
No way. I signed for them.

156
00:13:26,047 --> 00:13:28,216
It's my mission, my package.
I carry them, I deliver them.

157
00:13:28,717 --> 00:13:31,754
Well, that's just fine, but you seem to be
a little short of transportation right now,

158
00:13:32,254 --> 00:13:35,057
so my Team Alpha
will deliver you to me.

159
00:13:35,558 --> 00:13:36,994
And where exactly are you, sir?

160
00:13:37,494 --> 00:13:39,694
Come see for yourself.

161
00:13:52,979 --> 00:13:54,314
I thought all you Special Ops guys
were tough.

162
00:13:54,814 --> 00:13:58,284
We are tough. But we're also sensitive.

163
00:13:58,785 --> 00:13:59,653
I got it. Thanks.

164
00:14:00,153 --> 00:14:03,624
Wow, this is some primo stuff here.

165
00:14:04,125 --> 00:14:06,395
Hey, bro, you got
some real lifelike hair over there.

166
00:14:06,895 --> 00:14:08,030
And a kung fu grip.

167
00:14:08,530 --> 00:14:09,831
-Lie down.
-Okay.

168
00:14:10,332 --> 00:14:11,401
What kind of outfit is this, anyway?

169
00:14:11,901 --> 00:14:14,237
It's not regular Army,
based on all the accents.

170
00:14:14,737 --> 00:14:16,406
You're British.
What are you, French North African?

171
00:14:16,907 --> 00:14:18,042
Morocco. Where were you born?

172
00:14:18,542 --> 00:14:20,811
Duke wasn't born.
He was government-issued.

173
00:14:21,311 --> 00:14:23,280
-What about you?
-He doesn't speak.

174
00:14:23,781 --> 00:14:25,817
-Why?
-He doesn't say.

175
00:14:26,317 --> 00:14:28,420
He doesn't say.
So, somehow you're all in the same unit,

176
00:14:28,921 --> 00:14:30,356
but one you can't tell me
the name of, right?

177
00:14:30,856 --> 00:14:31,724
We'd get tossed for telling.

178
00:14:32,224 --> 00:14:36,562
You're gonna go after those guys
that hit my convoy, huh?

179
00:14:37,063 --> 00:14:40,500
Well, whoever you are
and whatever this unit is,

180
00:14:41,001 --> 00:14:42,501
I want in.

181
00:15:17,611 --> 00:15:18,545
General.

182
00:15:19,045 --> 00:15:20,047
-What's up, girl?
-Good job, Joes.

183
00:15:20,547 --> 00:15:21,715
Outstanding.

184
00:15:22,216 --> 00:15:25,153
Welcome to the Pit, Duke.
I've read a lot about you two.

185
00:15:25,653 --> 00:15:27,422
Well, you can't believe
everything you read. See, I actually...

186
00:15:27,923 --> 00:15:30,326
I understand we even tried to recruit you
a few years back.

187
00:15:30,826 --> 00:15:32,795
-I never got asked to join any Op group.
-Really?

188
00:15:33,295 --> 00:15:35,264
You don't remember Thailand
about 4 years ago?

189
00:15:35,765 --> 00:15:37,434
Right before you broke up that bar?

190
00:15:37,934 --> 00:15:39,136
About 4 years ago,
my boy had issues.

191
00:15:39,636 --> 00:15:41,338
I mean, his issues had issues.

192
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:43,441
I've been in the military my entire life

193
00:15:43,941 --> 00:15:45,943
and I have never seen
a tac operation like this.

194
00:15:46,444 --> 00:15:48,914
All right, you trusted me,
I guess I'll trust you.

195
00:15:49,414 --> 00:15:52,151
Technically, G.I. Joe does not exist,
but if it did,

196
00:15:52,652 --> 00:15:54,420
it'd be comprised
of the top men and women

197
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:59,259
from the best military units in the world,
the alpha dogs.

198
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:02,760
When all else fails, we don't.

199
00:16:03,563 --> 00:16:05,633
10 nations signed on in our first year,

200
00:16:06,134 --> 00:16:10,934
working together, sharing intel.
Now we have 23.

201
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:12,942
-What's that?
-Camouflage suit.

202
00:16:13,442 --> 00:16:18,114
It photographs everything behind you
and puts it in front of you.

203
00:16:18,615 --> 00:16:21,285
-Mr. McCullen is standing by, sir.
-Patch him through via TelePresence.

204
00:16:21,786 --> 00:16:23,087
-So who hit us?
-Currently unknown.

205
00:16:23,587 --> 00:16:24,422
But one thing's for sure,

206
00:16:24,922 --> 00:16:27,091
she's got highly classified intel
and state-of-the-art weaponry,

207
00:16:27,591 --> 00:16:29,027
which means there's a whole
hell of a lot of money behind her.

208
00:16:29,528 --> 00:16:31,697
Their capabilities are beyond anything
we've ever encountered.

209
00:16:32,197 --> 00:16:34,767
Yeah, that's the one and only reason
why we got our asses kicked out there.

210
00:16:35,268 --> 00:16:37,170
We need to find out
everything we can about her.

211
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:40,370
Knowing is half the battle.

212
00:16:41,608 --> 00:16:43,744
Gentlemen, Mr. McCullen,

213
00:16:44,244 --> 00:16:47,181
CEO of MARS Industries
and the builder of these warheads.

214
00:16:47,682 --> 00:16:50,052
General, clearly you were the
security option I should have chosen.

215
00:16:50,552 --> 00:16:53,922
What did you just say? My team
did everything we could out there,

216
00:16:54,423 --> 00:16:56,893
-and a lot of good men went down.
-Yeah, but not you.

217
00:16:57,393 --> 00:17:00,630
That mission was classified,
so clearly someone sold us out.

218
00:17:01,131 --> 00:17:04,602
I spent 10 years and 13 billion euros
creating these 4 warheads.

219
00:17:05,103 --> 00:17:07,372
Your job, Captain, was to protect them,

220
00:17:07,872 --> 00:17:10,108
and if it wasn't for General Hawk,
you'd have failed.

221
00:17:10,609 --> 00:17:14,380
That's not a fair assessment.
He followed his orders to the letter.

222
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,349
Well, that wasn't enough.

223
00:17:16,850 --> 00:17:19,419
Now, so the bastards who attacked you
can't find you,

224
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:22,055
you need to disable
the tracking beacon hidden in the case.

225
00:17:22,556 --> 00:17:25,059
-We already have.
-Good man.

226
00:17:25,559 --> 00:17:31,459
But allow me to check them
to see if any have been damaged.

227
00:17:37,173 --> 00:17:38,773
Open it, please.

228
00:17:39,877 --> 00:17:40,945
My scan says they're intact, sir.

229
00:17:41,445 --> 00:17:45,745
-What's the code?
-5-2-9-4-4-0.

230
00:18:09,610 --> 00:18:14,610
Please keep me informed
of your progress, General.

231
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:18,155
Breaker?

232
00:18:18,655 --> 00:18:22,059
My voice analyzer on that guy
was going up, down and sideways.

233
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:25,763
Looks like McCullen's working an angle
he don't want us to catch.

234
00:18:26,263 --> 00:18:28,933
We're on a deadline.
We need those warheads now!

235
00:18:29,434 --> 00:18:32,037
You knew that!
10 years setting this up,

236
00:18:32,537 --> 00:18:36,041
wringing money out of NATO,
this was supposed to be the easy part.

237
00:18:36,542 --> 00:18:39,012
If you had let me stage the assault
at your precious factory,

238
00:18:39,512 --> 00:18:40,280
I could have contained the situation.

239
00:18:40,781 --> 00:18:42,917
And lost the trust of our clients
in the process.

240
00:18:43,417 --> 00:18:46,017
It had to be NATO's fault!

241
00:18:49,591 --> 00:18:51,091
What happened?

242
00:18:52,294 --> 00:18:54,764
-Did you hesitate when you saw him?
-No.

243
00:18:55,264 --> 00:18:58,401
This had nothing to do with him.

244
00:18:58,902 --> 00:19:00,902
Forgive my jealousy.

245
00:19:06,844 --> 00:19:08,313
Have you tracked the case?

246
00:19:08,813 --> 00:19:11,649
They, of course,
deactivated the homing beacon.

247
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:15,821
I gave them a code
to quietly reactivate it.

248
00:19:16,322 --> 00:19:21,395
It's in Egypt.
The Pit, only mentioned in whispers.

249
00:19:21,896 --> 00:19:24,932
I will get those warheads back.

250
00:19:25,432 --> 00:19:26,932
I hope so.

251
00:19:29,971 --> 00:19:32,808
If I were really there,
I might actually let you touch me.

252
00:19:33,308 --> 00:19:36,835
-I'll send a jet.
-Business first.

253
00:19:37,413 --> 00:19:40,513
Besides, I'm married, remember?

254
00:19:41,151 --> 00:19:45,956
If you had sent me in the first place,
it would already be done.

255
00:19:46,457 --> 00:19:49,361
I'm sending you now, Storm Shadow.
No more mistakes.

256
00:19:49,861 --> 00:19:52,431
The schedule mustn't be compromised
any further.

257
00:19:52,932 --> 00:19:54,567
Keep your eye on her for me.

258
00:19:55,067 --> 00:19:59,071
American politics,
governors, senators, congressmen.

259
00:19:59,572 --> 00:20:00,908
No wonder nothing ever gets done.

260
00:20:01,408 --> 00:20:05,708
That's what we're going to fix,
Mr. Zartan.

261
00:20:31,977 --> 00:20:35,147
The king cobra, magnificent creature.

262
00:20:35,648 --> 00:20:38,585
Nature's Grim Reaper
and symbol of lethal purpose.

263
00:20:39,085 --> 00:20:41,454
Unseen until it strikes.

264
00:20:41,955 --> 00:20:44,625
Its venom can kill a full-grown elephant
with a single bite.

265
00:20:45,125 --> 00:20:47,928
-Very nice.
-So far we've created 20 Neo-Vipers.

266
00:20:48,429 --> 00:20:50,832
-19 stand before you.
-Is it working?

267
00:20:51,332 --> 00:20:56,071
We injected 1,000 cc of
the nanomite solution into each subject.

268
00:20:56,572 --> 00:20:58,875
When they finally stopped screaming,

269
00:20:59,376 --> 00:21:00,978
brain scans showed
a complete inactivity

270
00:21:01,478 --> 00:21:03,213
of the self-preservation region
of the cortex.

271
00:21:03,714 --> 00:21:05,314
English, Doctor?

272
00:21:08,419 --> 00:21:10,614
They feel no fear.

273
00:21:14,359 --> 00:21:18,430
Cortical nerve clusters
show complete inactivity.

274
00:21:18,931 --> 00:21:23,603
They feel no pain.
Concepts of morality are disengaged.

275
00:21:24,104 --> 00:21:28,040
They feel no regrets, no remorse.

276
00:21:31,379 --> 00:21:34,583
The nanomites join together
as a fighting mechanism,

277
00:21:35,084 --> 00:21:39,984
first blocking, then expelling
the cobra's venom.

278
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:46,460
And they're completely obedient?

279
00:21:47,498 --> 00:21:48,998
Of course.

280
00:21:50,201 --> 00:21:53,171
The real-world applications are endless.

281
00:21:53,672 --> 00:21:57,369
So, you tell me, is it working?

282
00:21:58,578 --> 00:22:01,148
Send a team to rendezvous
with Storm Shadow and the Baroness.

283
00:22:01,648 --> 00:22:07,348
Consider it done.
The Joes will never know what hit them.

284
00:22:09,356 --> 00:22:12,060
The 20th Neo-Viper is already set up
in Washington, DC

285
00:22:12,561 --> 00:22:13,362
and awaiting your signal.

286
00:22:13,862 --> 00:22:16,699
You've done well. You've thrown
the caber clear out of the yard.

287
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,703
Construction of the presidential bunker
has also been completed.

288
00:22:20,203 --> 00:22:22,272
Now, if we sold one warhead
on the black market,

289
00:22:22,773 --> 00:22:23,641
I could continue my research.

290
00:22:24,141 --> 00:22:25,743
I appreciate your thirst
for knowledge, Doctor,

291
00:22:26,243 --> 00:22:29,046
but this world is messy enough. No.

292
00:22:29,547 --> 00:22:33,647
What it needs is unification, leadership.

293
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:40,820
It has to be taken out of chaos
by someone with complete control.

294
00:22:41,561 --> 00:22:44,231
Beijing, Moscow, Washington...

295
00:22:44,731 --> 00:22:46,000
When these missiles detonate,

296
00:22:46,501 --> 00:22:50,639
the world will turn
to the most powerful man on the planet.

297
00:22:51,139 --> 00:22:54,042
When I'm finished,
the money will take care of itself.

298
00:22:54,543 --> 00:22:59,243
You'll be able to do
all the research you want.

299
00:23:03,854 --> 00:23:06,457
We grabbed this image
from one of our tactical cameras.

300
00:23:06,957 --> 00:23:11,562
Now we're running her face
through an infinity scan.

301
00:23:12,063 --> 00:23:13,632
Hey, isn't that...

302
00:23:14,132 --> 00:23:16,802
We have access to any photograph
on any server, anywhere in the world.

303
00:23:17,303 --> 00:23:20,073
Yep. Everyone gets photographed
in some way at some time.

304
00:23:20,573 --> 00:23:22,342
Football game, ATM machine, airport...

305
00:23:22,843 --> 00:23:25,579
We'll find her,
and then we'll find out who sent her.

306
00:23:26,079 --> 00:23:28,849
-From NATO, sir.
-Are you okay?

307
00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:31,450
What happened to her?

308
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:35,991
Well, it appears that I've been made
official custodian of the warheads.

309
00:23:36,492 --> 00:23:38,127
Looks like your mission
is complete here, Duke.

310
00:23:38,627 --> 00:23:40,830
When you move them, she's gonna
come after you. You know that, right?

311
00:23:41,331 --> 00:23:43,600
And with her intel and toys,
she'll find you.

312
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:44,668
What's your point?

313
00:23:45,168 --> 00:23:47,504
You're going after her first
and we want in.

314
00:23:48,005 --> 00:23:50,642
General, it was our team that got wasted
out there. We deserve payback.

315
00:23:51,142 --> 00:23:55,547
You don't ask to be part of G.I. Joe.
You get asked.

316
00:23:56,048 --> 00:23:58,918
You scouted me 4 years ago.
Now I'm ready. Let's have at it.

317
00:23:59,419 --> 00:24:00,821
Well, I've lost men, too, Captain.

318
00:24:01,321 --> 00:24:02,556
-If you want revenge...
-I know her.

319
00:24:03,056 --> 00:24:03,657
Excuse me?

320
00:24:04,158 --> 00:24:06,394
You said
knowing's half the battle, right?

321
00:24:06,894 --> 00:24:08,796
Well, I know who she is.

322
00:24:09,297 --> 00:24:11,533
She was a blonde.
Her name is Ana Lewis.

323
00:24:12,033 --> 00:24:14,002
I could tell you everything
you need to know about her,

324
00:24:14,502 --> 00:24:15,804
up until the last 4 years.

325
00:24:16,305 --> 00:24:21,505
After that, obviously,
a lot of things have changed.

326
00:24:38,797 --> 00:24:41,297
Finally, my wife is home.

327
00:24:44,904 --> 00:24:47,407
Hello, Daniel. How was your meeting
with the Minister of Defense?

328
00:24:47,908 --> 00:24:50,812
He was thrilled.
The accelerator performed flawlessly.

329
00:24:51,313 --> 00:24:53,249
I wish you would have been there.

330
00:24:53,749 --> 00:24:55,618
You and your little lab rats
are so clever.

331
00:24:56,118 --> 00:24:58,354
-How was Monte Carlo?
-I didn't get what I was after.

332
00:24:58,855 --> 00:25:01,158
-I suppose I should be grateful.
-Most husbands would be.

333
00:25:01,658 --> 00:25:04,127
Most husbands don't have
such mysterious wives.

334
00:25:04,628 --> 00:25:06,464
They know exactly where they are
and what they do.

335
00:25:06,964 --> 00:25:07,832
They think they know.

336
00:25:08,332 --> 00:25:11,102
Ana, I don't wanna fight. I missed you.

337
00:25:11,603 --> 00:25:15,103
Well, I never tire of a good fight.

338
00:25:15,841 --> 00:25:19,412
But not with you, darling. Let me
freshen up and I'll meet you downstairs.

339
00:25:19,912 --> 00:25:23,612
I do love you, my beautiful Baroness.

340
00:25:29,157 --> 00:25:32,994
McCullen gave me orders to kill
the Baron if he so much as touched you.

341
00:25:33,495 --> 00:25:35,932
Well, he's my husband.
Of course he touches me.

342
00:25:36,432 --> 00:25:39,435
And besides, his work at the lab goes
much better after we've touched.

343
00:25:39,936 --> 00:25:42,005
And that's the important thing.

344
00:25:42,505 --> 00:25:45,275
So what are you doing? Spying on me?

345
00:25:45,776 --> 00:25:50,276
If I was spying on you,
you would never know.

346
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:54,384
Getting closer.

347
00:25:55,087 --> 00:25:57,587
You were my best student.

348
00:25:58,891 --> 00:26:01,194
I'll be coming with you
to retrieve the warheads.

349
00:26:01,694 --> 00:26:03,194
We go at dawn.

350
00:26:26,690 --> 00:26:28,190
Come on, Ana.

351
00:26:30,695 --> 00:26:36,295
Okay, so, I've been wanting to do this
before we deploy.

352
00:26:42,776 --> 00:26:45,746
Duke, it's beautiful. It's too beautiful.

353
00:26:46,247 --> 00:26:50,947
I'm only going to buy one of these,
so why not?

354
00:26:51,887 --> 00:26:52,988
So what do you say?

355
00:26:53,488 --> 00:26:55,891
Say yes, you idiot.
He's a real American hero.

356
00:26:56,391 --> 00:26:57,092
Thanks for ruining the mood, Rex.

357
00:26:57,593 --> 00:26:59,529
I apologize. I just came to offer you
a ride back to post.

358
00:27:00,029 --> 00:27:01,364
What? It's time already?

359
00:27:01,864 --> 00:27:04,968
-Yeah, we got to go at 0500.
-Is it...

360
00:27:05,469 --> 00:27:07,705
Yeah, it is, right? That's why
you're pulling Rex out of the lab.

361
00:27:08,205 --> 00:27:12,109
-Ana, look, I'm sorry, but I can't...
-Yeah, yeah, classified, top secret,

362
00:27:12,610 --> 00:27:13,779
you'd have to kill me if you told me,
blah-blah-blah.

363
00:27:14,279 --> 00:27:19,084
And speaking of classified information,
you still haven't answered me.

364
00:27:19,585 --> 00:27:23,146
Yes. Yes. Of course it's yes.

365
00:27:24,391 --> 00:27:26,091
On one condition.

366
00:27:26,693 --> 00:27:29,697
You have to promise me
that you will not let my genius,

367
00:27:30,198 --> 00:27:32,334
egghead brother get hurt.

368
00:27:32,834 --> 00:27:35,770
He's the only family I've got left.

369
00:27:36,271 --> 00:27:37,773
Promise me, Duke.

370
00:27:38,273 --> 00:27:39,773
I promise.

371
00:27:42,245 --> 00:27:45,282
-Hey! My 3 favorite people.
-Mr. Weems. Good, man?

372
00:27:45,783 --> 00:27:46,617
-Yeah.
-Look.

373
00:27:47,117 --> 00:27:50,817
Wow. Nice rock. That's a lot of love.

374
00:27:51,690 --> 00:27:53,092
-Are you proposing?
-I'm actually done proposing.

375
00:27:53,592 --> 00:27:56,628
-I already said yes.
-Oh, my God! Congratulations!

376
00:27:57,129 --> 00:28:00,500
Beautiful! You guys are like the little
white couple on the wedding cake.

377
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,670
How cute. Give me some love.

378
00:28:04,171 --> 00:28:06,007
Congratulations. Wait. It's not official.

379
00:28:06,507 --> 00:28:08,042
-What?
-It's not official.

380
00:28:08,542 --> 00:28:11,846
-Not until you answer my question.
-Okay.

381
00:28:12,347 --> 00:28:14,247
Do you love my boy?

382
00:28:15,918 --> 00:28:18,716
Always and forever.

383
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:25,662
You may have blackmailed
your way onto this team.

384
00:28:26,162 --> 00:28:28,098
Doesn't mean I've got to like it.

385
00:28:28,599 --> 00:28:31,336
But it does mean
I've gotta get you mission ready,

386
00:28:31,836 --> 00:28:33,336
Joe style.

387
00:28:34,106 --> 00:28:37,543
Standing in front of you
are Delta-6 Accelerator suits.

388
00:28:38,043 --> 00:28:39,545
-What does it accelerate?
-You.

389
00:28:40,046 --> 00:28:44,017
It'll make you run faster, jump higher
and hit harder than any of your enemies.

390
00:28:44,517 --> 00:28:45,452
Let's suit up.

391
00:28:45,953 --> 00:28:51,653
Head-to-toe hydraulics
and highly pressurized pneumatics.

392
00:28:52,427 --> 00:28:54,963
An advanced cybernetics
heads-up display helmet,

393
00:28:55,463 --> 00:28:56,799
which feeds into the suit.

394
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:59,800
You think it, it does it.

395
00:29:01,904 --> 00:29:03,306
Twin gas-propelled grappling spears

396
00:29:03,807 --> 00:29:06,477
and triple-explosive,
heat-seeking, fire-and-forget rockets.

397
00:29:06,977 --> 00:29:08,212
And my personal favorite,

398
00:29:08,712 --> 00:29:11,148
a 10-millimeter caseless
Gatling submachine gun,

399
00:29:11,649 --> 00:29:15,487
capable of firing 50 rounds per second.
Fully self-contained firepower.

400
00:29:15,988 --> 00:29:18,991
Perfect for a couple of cowboys like you.

401
00:29:19,491 --> 00:29:21,794
I just missed everything you said.
Hey, how do I look?

402
00:29:22,295 --> 00:29:25,695
-Pretty cool, huh?
-Any questions?

403
00:29:41,084 --> 00:29:41,852
Yo, Sergeant Stone.

404
00:29:42,352 --> 00:29:45,122
-Are they Joes?
-Hell, no. They're jokes.

405
00:29:45,623 --> 00:29:47,058
Boys.

406
00:29:47,558 --> 00:29:49,958
You're gonna need these.

407
00:29:55,367 --> 00:29:58,604
Just so you know,
when I get a target in my sights,

408
00:29:59,105 --> 00:30:00,605
I take it down.

409
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,940
Oh, shit!

410
00:30:05,512 --> 00:30:07,241
-Again.
-Again?

411
00:30:22,532 --> 00:30:28,632
Just so you know, some targets
are harder to hit than others.

412
00:30:31,909 --> 00:30:35,809
-Again.
-You're gonna need that helmet.

413
00:30:45,959 --> 00:30:47,261
Stand down, Snake Eyes.

414
00:30:47,761 --> 00:30:53,461
All right. Walk away. It's over.
This ain't pay-per-view.

415
00:30:54,669 --> 00:30:55,637
I'm nasty with it!

416
00:30:56,137 --> 00:30:56,772
You missed one.

417
00:30:57,273 --> 00:30:58,775
Come on. That gotta be
some kind of a record or something.

418
00:30:59,275 --> 00:31:01,511
-The record is all 20 killed.
-Who did that? Let me guess.

419
00:31:02,011 --> 00:31:04,147
-Snake Eyes?
-No. Me.

420
00:31:04,648 --> 00:31:11,948
If you're gonna shoot at something,
kill it. Otherwise, take up knitting.

421
00:31:17,396 --> 00:31:20,396
Beginner's luck. Stay focused.

422
00:31:25,605 --> 00:31:27,470
-Again.
-Again?

423
00:31:33,782 --> 00:31:36,185
I have never seen Snake Eyes take a hit.

424
00:31:36,685 --> 00:31:38,243
They're Joes.

425
00:31:39,689 --> 00:31:41,189
Maybe.

426
00:31:47,364 --> 00:31:48,733
Let's go.

427
00:31:49,233 --> 00:31:53,170
Hey, man, Breaker told me that Scarlett
graduated college at 12 years old.

428
00:31:53,671 --> 00:31:55,440
She's like some freaky little
deadly genius.

429
00:31:55,940 --> 00:32:00,940
-Rip. I get it, Rip. You like her.
-Sorry, my bad.

430
00:32:01,614 --> 00:32:05,106
-To hell with it.
-Rip. Rip.

431
00:32:07,788 --> 00:32:09,890
Into the valley of death rode the 600.

432
00:32:10,391 --> 00:32:14,262
Hey, what are you doing?
A little beach reading?

433
00:32:14,762 --> 00:32:16,262
Okay.

434
00:32:17,866 --> 00:32:21,604
Look, I think you and me
got off on the wrong foot.

435
00:32:22,105 --> 00:32:26,677
See, I'm attracted to you.
And you, you're attracted to me.

436
00:32:27,178 --> 00:32:28,379
And him, the damn Zen master,

437
00:32:28,879 --> 00:32:30,315
he creeps me out.
What I'm trying to say is...

438
00:32:30,815 --> 00:32:32,884
-We're attracted to each other.
-Thank you!

439
00:32:33,385 --> 00:32:36,221
That's what you're saying.
It's not what I'm saying.

440
00:32:36,721 --> 00:32:38,221
It's not?

441
00:32:39,025 --> 00:32:41,425
So, what are you saying?

442
00:32:43,763 --> 00:32:46,900
Attraction is an emotion.
Emotions are not based in science.

443
00:32:47,401 --> 00:32:50,805
And if you can't quantify
or prove that something exists, well,

444
00:32:51,306 --> 00:32:53,606
in my mind, it doesn't.

445
00:32:54,876 --> 00:32:57,145
Okay. I'll get back to you on that one.

446
00:32:57,646 --> 00:32:59,716
Attention! General on deck!

447
00:33:00,216 --> 00:33:02,218
At ease. Duke,

448
00:33:02,718 --> 00:33:06,356
you scored in the top half percent
of all people we've ever tested.

449
00:33:06,857 --> 00:33:10,527
Rip, if we average your scores
with Duke's, you pass, too.

450
00:33:11,028 --> 00:33:12,030
-Welcome aboard.
-Thank you, sir.

451
00:33:12,530 --> 00:33:16,830
-Provisionally, of course.
-Thank you, sir.

452
00:33:34,522 --> 00:33:37,326
Sir, sensors detecting seismic activity
to the southwest.

453
00:33:37,826 --> 00:33:42,726
Probably just a tremor,
but have a team check it.

454
00:34:27,952 --> 00:34:29,387
There's our little weapons case.

455
00:34:29,887 --> 00:34:33,587
All right. You 3, guard the machines.

456
00:35:01,290 --> 00:35:03,092
-Sorry to disturb you, sir.
-That's all right, Corporal.

457
00:35:03,593 --> 00:35:09,793
I need you to sign here, here and here.
And also here, here...

458
00:35:18,877 --> 00:35:20,877
Goodbye, sweetheart.

459
00:35:25,885 --> 00:35:28,054
That's right. You don't kill women.

460
00:35:28,555 --> 00:35:32,455
For you, Zartan, I'd make an exception.

461
00:35:59,525 --> 00:36:01,825
Warheads, Rip! Come on!

462
00:36:06,399 --> 00:36:07,899
Go, go!

463
00:36:11,639 --> 00:36:13,675
We've got the warheads.
Prep the Mole Pods for evac.

464
00:36:14,175 --> 00:36:18,175
-We're on our way.
-We're already on it.

465
00:36:33,031 --> 00:36:37,102
-Now how do we get out of here?
-Follow me.

466
00:36:37,602 --> 00:36:40,102
Like that's gonna happen.

467
00:36:50,283 --> 00:36:52,086
Find the control room.
Open the exterior hatch.

468
00:36:52,587 --> 00:36:56,187
-And secure this area.
-We're on it.

469
00:36:59,495 --> 00:37:00,995
Clear.

470
00:37:11,442 --> 00:37:12,942
Go, go!

471
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:19,151
-Can you fly one of these things?
-Don't move! Ana, put the case down.

472
00:37:19,651 --> 00:37:22,119
Fine. Done.

473
00:37:24,724 --> 00:37:26,292
Stop. Ana, stop right there.

474
00:37:26,793 --> 00:37:28,963
-You can't shoot me, can you?
-I will if I have to.

475
00:37:29,463 --> 00:37:31,766
Deep down, you're still the same man
I fell in love with.

476
00:37:32,266 --> 00:37:36,404
-Don't force this.
-What could have been. Right, Duke?

477
00:37:36,905 --> 00:37:38,840
Just give me the case, God damn it.

478
00:37:39,341 --> 00:37:44,747
-Move and I'm gonna blow her away.
-Do it. You already killed me once.

479
00:37:45,248 --> 00:37:46,848
Duke, watch out!

480
00:37:59,097 --> 00:38:00,997
Ana, drop the case!

481
00:38:14,783 --> 00:38:16,283
Hello, brother.

482
00:38:42,615 --> 00:38:44,115
Damn!

483
00:38:48,622 --> 00:38:50,122
Eat this!

484
00:39:13,984 --> 00:39:15,484
Hey, genius!

485
00:40:29,373 --> 00:40:30,873
See you, Duke.

486
00:40:59,608 --> 00:41:02,177
-How many warheads?
-4, Mr. President.

487
00:41:02,678 --> 00:41:05,448
-Any threats? Demands?
-None so far, sir.

488
00:41:05,948 --> 00:41:07,517
We take this to mean
the terrorists are unfocused.

489
00:41:08,017 --> 00:41:10,117
-No clear goals.
-No.

490
00:41:11,388 --> 00:41:14,125
It means they intend to use them.

491
00:41:14,626 --> 00:41:15,761
General Hawk is stable now,

492
00:41:16,261 --> 00:41:18,196
but he won't be conscious
for another day or so.

493
00:41:18,696 --> 00:41:20,996
He's one tough bastard.

494
00:41:32,580 --> 00:41:34,080
Hey.

495
00:41:36,784 --> 00:41:38,787
-You all right?
-I'm fine.

496
00:41:39,288 --> 00:41:42,825
-I didn't want anyone to see me like this.
-Why?

497
00:41:43,325 --> 00:41:44,994
I don't know. All the men we lost,
General Hawk wounded,

498
00:41:45,495 --> 00:41:46,730
my neck just doesn't seem important.

499
00:41:47,230 --> 00:41:53,036
You almost lost your life out there.
You have a reason to be concerned.

500
00:41:53,537 --> 00:41:56,941
First fight I lost since I was a kid.

501
00:41:57,442 --> 00:41:59,078
My father taught me to win.

502
00:41:59,578 --> 00:42:06,785
Look, I don't see how you could teach
anybody to win everything every time.

503
00:42:07,286 --> 00:42:08,688
I mean, look at you.

504
00:42:09,189 --> 00:42:10,658
You're still here, right?

505
00:42:11,158 --> 00:42:13,160
You get knocked down, you get back up.

506
00:42:13,660 --> 00:42:17,760
Maybe that's
what he wanted you to learn.

507
00:42:18,299 --> 00:42:20,802
But then again,
that would be an emotional response,

508
00:42:21,303 --> 00:42:25,503
one that can't be explained or quantified.

509
00:42:40,993 --> 00:42:46,093
Hey. Looks like we're all
seeing ghosts today, huh?

510
00:44:22,741 --> 00:44:24,241
Storm Shadow!

511
00:44:28,114 --> 00:44:31,117
English, Storm Shadow.
Where are your manners?

512
00:44:31,617 --> 00:44:32,952
He is hungry.

513
00:44:33,453 --> 00:44:37,458
We need to invite him in
and show him the path.

514
00:44:37,958 --> 00:44:43,358
-He is a cur, a weakling!
-He does not fight like one.

515
00:44:47,569 --> 00:44:50,369
Now, what shall we call you?

516
00:44:56,147 --> 00:44:58,716
This belonged to an ancestor of mine.

517
00:44:59,216 --> 00:45:01,219
He was caught selling arms
to both sides.

518
00:45:01,719 --> 00:45:04,522
The French forced him to wear it
for the rest of his life.

519
00:45:05,023 --> 00:45:08,561
They called him Destro,
destroyer of nations.

520
00:45:09,062 --> 00:45:10,096
So why do you keep it?

521
00:45:10,596 --> 00:45:12,866
So that I never forget
the most important rule in dealing arms.

522
00:45:13,366 --> 00:45:15,535
Let me guess. Never sell to both sides?

523
00:45:16,036 --> 00:45:19,936
Never get caught selling to both sides.

524
00:45:21,543 --> 00:45:23,412
Take the warheads to Paris.
Have them weaponized.

525
00:45:23,912 --> 00:45:25,647
-Then I want you to test one.
-Test one?

526
00:45:26,148 --> 00:45:29,786
We'll let CNN show the world
how well they perform.

527
00:45:30,286 --> 00:45:32,886
Fear is a great motivator.

528
00:45:35,759 --> 00:45:40,231
I have a target in mind,
one the French will never forget,

529
00:45:40,732 --> 00:45:46,232
as I've never forgotten
what they did to Clan McCullen.

530
00:45:53,947 --> 00:45:56,483
-Are you ready, Mr. Zartan?
-Born ready, Doctor.

531
00:45:56,984 --> 00:45:58,553
This is going to be
the achievement of a lifetime.

532
00:45:59,053 --> 00:46:01,623
Yes, as a master of disguise,
you have no equal, my friend.

533
00:46:02,124 --> 00:46:05,661
18 months of studying my target,
learning mannerisms,

534
00:46:06,161 --> 00:46:07,563
but the devil is in the details.

535
00:46:08,064 --> 00:46:10,433
Gentlemen, let's get it going.

536
00:46:10,933 --> 00:46:11,735
One more thing.

537
00:46:12,235 --> 00:46:16,935
I'll control my own brain,
thank you very much.

538
00:46:18,308 --> 00:46:19,808
Let's do this.

539
00:46:38,533 --> 00:46:42,333
-Wow. That was a bit nasty.
-Think so?

540
00:46:43,337 --> 00:46:45,437
Let's run some tests.

541
00:46:46,642 --> 00:46:52,638
Eye color. Skin tone. Hair follicles.

542
00:46:53,149 --> 00:46:57,449
And initiating facial reconstruction tests.

543
00:47:07,666 --> 00:47:08,967
We gotta find out
who's holding their leash.

544
00:47:09,468 --> 00:47:12,539
With their weaponry, financing
and intel, these guys are high-line pros.

545
00:47:13,039 --> 00:47:14,341
That limits the possibilities.

546
00:47:14,842 --> 00:47:17,745
-Hey, the weapons case.
-What?

547
00:47:18,245 --> 00:47:19,447
Remember, McCullen had us
open the weapons case?

548
00:47:19,947 --> 00:47:21,248
-What about it?
-I bet you he gave us a code

549
00:47:21,749 --> 00:47:23,518
that reactivated the tracking beacon.

550
00:47:24,018 --> 00:47:27,122
You're right.
McCullen, that son of a bitch.

551
00:47:27,623 --> 00:47:29,592
So, McCullen uses NATO
to fund his R&D

552
00:47:30,092 --> 00:47:31,361
and then he steals the warheads back.

553
00:47:31,861 --> 00:47:37,166
-And who says you're not a thinker?
-Hey, I found her.

554
00:47:37,667 --> 00:47:38,635
Yeah, that's her all right.

555
00:47:39,136 --> 00:47:42,640
Her name is Ana de Cobray.
Baroness, if you're feeling formal.

556
00:47:43,140 --> 00:47:46,277
Baroness? Wow, she really traded up.
Financially, of course.

557
00:47:46,778 --> 00:47:48,447
-Who's he?
-Daniel de Cobray.

558
00:47:48,947 --> 00:47:51,283
Big shot French scientist.
Runs a lab in Paris.

559
00:47:51,784 --> 00:47:55,489
-Lab? What kind of lab?
-Particle accelerator.

560
00:47:55,990 --> 00:47:59,794
Oh, my God. They're going to use him
to weaponize the warheads.

561
00:48:00,294 --> 00:48:01,896
Well, that's where she's going.

562
00:48:02,397 --> 00:48:04,197
I like croissants.

563
00:48:35,268 --> 00:48:37,704
-Go, go, go!
-Come on! Let's go! Let's go!

564
00:48:38,205 --> 00:48:40,305
Pull up on the truck!

565
00:48:43,377 --> 00:48:44,877
Go, go, go!

566
00:48:45,914 --> 00:48:48,617
-2 o'clock!
-Go, go, go!

567
00:48:49,117 --> 00:48:50,617
Go, let's move!

568
00:48:53,556 --> 00:48:55,792
-In the alley!
-Get down, get down!

569
00:48:56,293 --> 00:48:57,793
You see them?

570
00:48:59,930 --> 00:49:02,600
-2 more on the left!
-Get down!

571
00:49:03,101 --> 00:49:06,501
Dubble Bubble? It always helps me.

572
00:49:07,272 --> 00:49:09,832
Yeah. Hey, you good?

573
00:49:10,643 --> 00:49:12,143
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

574
00:49:14,014 --> 00:49:16,283
All right, Mr. Science Officer,
you're up, okay?

575
00:49:16,783 --> 00:49:18,285
You don't find it in 4 minutes,
you get out of there.

576
00:49:18,785 --> 00:49:22,389
That house will not be there in 5.
I already called for the air strike.

577
00:49:22,890 --> 00:49:24,890
Come on! Here we go!

578
00:49:26,996 --> 00:49:29,196
I got you! Go, go, go!

579
00:49:30,933 --> 00:49:32,594
Oh, crap!

580
00:49:35,905 --> 00:49:37,405
Rooftop!

581
00:49:40,277 --> 00:49:41,546
Hey, Duke, I gotta level with you.

582
00:49:42,046 --> 00:49:49,046
-I hate it when you level with me.
-It's going to be a long 5 minutes.

583
00:49:51,124 --> 00:49:54,494
No, no, no! It's too early. It's too early!

584
00:49:54,994 --> 00:49:57,622
-Duke!
-Rex! Rex!

585
00:50:17,687 --> 00:50:19,187
Rex.

586
00:50:22,794 --> 00:50:24,329
Duke! Come on. We gotta go.

587
00:50:24,829 --> 00:50:25,931
-I gotta get Rex.
-We gotta go, man!

588
00:50:26,432 --> 00:50:28,834
Black Hawk's waiting! We gotta go!
Nothing you can do!

589
00:50:29,334 --> 00:50:34,534
-Nothing you can do, man! Come on!
-I gotta get Rex.

590
00:50:36,342 --> 00:50:38,936
Ready. Aim. Fire.

591
00:50:39,814 --> 00:50:41,441
Forward, march.

592
00:51:34,744 --> 00:51:38,344
Are you going to sign in or shall I?

593
00:52:01,308 --> 00:52:02,808
Ana?

594
00:52:04,312 --> 00:52:05,747
Who is this?

595
00:52:06,247 --> 00:52:07,315
Hey! What are you doing?

596
00:52:07,816 --> 00:52:09,352
-What's going on here?
-I need you to do something for me

597
00:52:09,852 --> 00:52:11,888
and I don't have much time.

598
00:52:12,388 --> 00:52:13,723
What are these things?

599
00:52:14,224 --> 00:52:15,225
They're warheads, dear.

600
00:52:15,725 --> 00:52:20,931
And I need you to weaponize them
for me, or we'll kill everyone in here.

601
00:52:21,432 --> 00:52:24,402
Hey! This is a civilian laboratory!

602
00:52:24,902 --> 00:52:27,205
We don't have the correct
programming protocols for weaponizing!

603
00:52:27,706 --> 00:52:34,306
The protocols are in the case.
I told you, I don't have much time.

604
00:52:44,059 --> 00:52:45,961
Hey, is that Dubble Bubble?

605
00:52:46,461 --> 00:52:48,030
But it's my last piece.

606
00:52:48,530 --> 00:52:50,833
-Come on, give it to me.
-All right, there you go.

607
00:52:51,334 --> 00:52:53,870
All right. Stick to the plan.
Scarlett, Snake Eyes, take the front.

608
00:52:54,370 --> 00:52:56,473
Rip, Duke, take the back.
Breaker will be our eyes and ears.

609
00:52:56,974 --> 00:52:57,808
I'll give the orders from here.

610
00:52:58,308 --> 00:53:03,508
-You do what I say, when I say. Got it?
-Yes, Daddy.

611
00:53:49,669 --> 00:53:51,070
Here.

612
00:53:51,570 --> 00:53:55,070
-They're all alive.
-Merci, Daniel.

613
00:54:11,226 --> 00:54:13,996
I told you I'd kill him
if he touched you again.

614
00:54:14,497 --> 00:54:17,197
I heard you the first time.

615
00:54:22,173 --> 00:54:28,573
Okay, we're almost there.
Scarlett, you better put your suit on.

616
00:54:35,355 --> 00:54:36,855
That's her.

617
00:54:43,765 --> 00:54:46,165
Take that Hummer, Snake!

618
00:55:10,062 --> 00:55:11,731
Careful.
They're worth millions of dollars each.

619
00:55:12,231 --> 00:55:14,700
Millions of dollars. Got it.

620
00:55:15,201 --> 00:55:19,601
-Jesus.
-My bad. My bad. Won't happen again!

621
00:55:22,309 --> 00:55:23,611
Thanks a lot, buddy!

622
00:55:24,111 --> 00:55:30,811
Come on, Scarlett, babe. You in or out?
We gotta get in this fight!

623
00:55:39,263 --> 00:55:45,663
Tracking signal is good.
Don't let go of that truck, Snake Eyes.

624
00:56:15,738 --> 00:56:19,338
Let's get that bastard off the roof.

625
00:56:46,608 --> 00:56:48,108
Look out!

626
00:56:51,313 --> 00:56:52,482
Hey, Heavy, it's getting thick out here!

627
00:56:52,982 --> 00:56:54,984
Yeah, I know. They're driving
right into the heaviest traffic.

628
00:56:55,485 --> 00:56:56,620
What kind of escape route is that?

629
00:56:57,120 --> 00:56:59,723
Maybe they're not trying to escape.
Maybe they're heading somewhere.

630
00:57:00,223 --> 00:57:02,523
-Possible target?
-Yes.

631
00:57:04,529 --> 00:57:08,192
Some place with a lot of metal.

632
00:57:11,670 --> 00:57:15,174
-They're going to blow it up. All units!
-Guys, you have to stop them!

633
00:57:15,675 --> 00:57:16,777
Yeah, we're working on it.

634
00:57:17,277 --> 00:57:17,878
I mean right now!

635
00:57:18,378 --> 00:57:24,978
They're going to detonate one
of the warheads on the Eiffel Tower!

636
00:57:54,987 --> 00:57:56,487
Crush him!

637
00:57:57,324 --> 00:57:58,824
Snake!

638
00:58:04,332 --> 00:58:06,932
He's underneath. Kill him!

639
00:58:18,214 --> 00:58:22,914
That redhead is really starting
to piss me off.

640
00:58:24,321 --> 00:58:25,821
Shit!

641
00:58:26,458 --> 00:58:27,958
Oh, God!

642
00:58:29,227 --> 00:58:31,327
I got you. I got you.

643
00:58:32,431 --> 00:58:33,066
-Nice save, slick.
-Come on,

644
00:58:33,566 --> 00:58:38,266
don't start being all nice to me now.
Gotta go.

645
00:58:40,807 --> 00:58:42,307
Get in!

646
00:58:45,980 --> 00:58:51,880
All right, Rip, let's take this thing down!
Hang on, Snake!

647
00:58:57,861 --> 00:59:00,561
Try this on for size, boys.

648
00:59:14,947 --> 00:59:16,447
Oh, shit!

649
00:59:34,970 --> 00:59:36,306
We lost them!

650
00:59:36,806 --> 00:59:37,974
Cut through that building
across the street.

651
00:59:38,475 --> 00:59:39,677
-Where's the door?
-Make one!

652
00:59:40,177 --> 00:59:42,177
Right! Come on, Rip!

653
00:59:42,913 --> 00:59:45,213
I'm coming. I'm coming!

654
00:59:45,950 --> 00:59:49,350
I don't have them! Where are they?

655
01:00:10,245 --> 01:00:12,448
-They're evacuating the Tower.
-We're only 2 kilometers away.

656
01:00:12,948 --> 01:00:14,650
Snake, we're running out of time.
You gotta do something.

657
01:00:15,151 --> 01:00:16,951
It's now or never.

658
01:00:25,997 --> 01:00:29,197
-He gave up.
-He never gives up.

659
01:00:41,982 --> 01:00:43,482
Coming through!

660
01:01:05,075 --> 01:01:08,112
Okay, that was crazy.
I didn't expect that.

661
01:01:08,613 --> 01:01:10,649
-What happened to you?
-I went through the train.

662
01:01:11,149 --> 01:01:13,552
-What happened to you?
-I jumped over it.

663
01:01:14,053 --> 01:01:16,690
-You can do that?
-Yeah. I told you to read that manual.

664
01:01:17,190 --> 01:01:18,890
There's a manual?

665
01:01:22,763 --> 01:01:25,231
Next time, I'll drive.

666
01:01:38,281 --> 01:01:40,981
Here. Take the kill switch.

667
01:01:50,829 --> 01:01:53,629
Come on. Get out of the way!

668
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:56,769
Hey, guys, they're alive
and they're on the move.

669
01:01:57,270 --> 01:02:01,541
And they've activated the warhead.
I'm tracking the kill switch now.

670
01:02:02,042 --> 01:02:02,844
Duke! Duke, it's on the Baroness!

671
01:02:03,344 --> 01:02:08,644
Storm Shadow has one of the warheads,
and it's armed!

672
01:02:16,692 --> 01:02:19,392
Get out of my way! Get out!

673
01:02:20,330 --> 01:02:21,830
Get out!

674
01:02:23,033 --> 01:02:24,533
Nice shoes.

675
01:02:34,847 --> 01:02:36,015
You get the warhead,
I'll get the kill switch.

676
01:02:36,515 --> 01:02:38,115
Yeah, I'm on it.

677
01:03:00,777 --> 01:03:03,177
Damn, that ninja's fast!

678
01:03:05,916 --> 01:03:07,416
No.

679
01:03:31,914 --> 01:03:33,414
Oh, no!

680
01:03:45,896 --> 01:03:48,057
-Bloody hell.
-No.

681
01:04:09,457 --> 01:04:10,425
They're gonna eat through
the entire city.

682
01:04:10,925 --> 01:04:14,825
Duke, you have to hit that kill switch!

683
01:04:45,099 --> 01:04:46,760
Oh, God.

684
01:05:09,561 --> 01:05:11,061
Disarmed.

685
01:05:24,244 --> 01:05:28,644
Congratulations, Duke.
You just saved Paris.

686
01:05:29,584 --> 01:05:31,884
Or at least most of it.

687
01:06:01,088 --> 01:06:04,659
-Is that blood?
-Spaghetti sauce. Don't ask.

688
01:06:05,159 --> 01:06:06,927
-They got Duke.
-We know.

689
01:06:07,428 --> 01:06:09,531
-What are you doing?
-Plugging into his cerebral cortex.

690
01:06:10,031 --> 01:06:10,666
I hate to break the news to you,

691
01:06:11,166 --> 01:06:13,035
but I don't think he's gonna
give you much in his dead condition.

692
01:06:13,536 --> 01:06:15,004
The brain survives
a couple of minutes after death.

693
01:06:15,504 --> 01:06:17,740
We can retrieve the electrical impulses
from his most recent memories

694
01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:19,942
-and convert them to images.
-Well, can we find Duke?

695
01:06:20,443 --> 01:06:21,612
We need to find
the other 3 warheads first.

696
01:06:22,112 --> 01:06:25,616
If this guy remembers his way home,
maybe we can find both.

697
01:06:26,117 --> 01:06:32,117
Okay, here come the images.
Let's see where this guy's been.

698
01:06:34,893 --> 01:06:35,528
-He's still alive!
-He can't be.

699
01:06:36,028 --> 01:06:36,696
He's got 3-inch needles in his head!

700
01:06:37,197 --> 01:06:39,900
-Hey, dead guys don't breakdance!
-What's happening, Breaker?

701
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:42,803
-Nanomites, they're eating him.
-Must be some sort of self-destruct.

702
01:06:43,304 --> 01:06:46,941
-Hurry, Breaker!
-Come on, come on, come on.

703
01:06:47,441 --> 01:06:49,375
No. No!

704
01:06:51,546 --> 01:06:53,046
No, no, no!

705
01:06:54,683 --> 01:06:57,583
The beauty of nanotechnology.

706
01:06:58,821 --> 01:07:00,623
-We are screwed.
-Relax. I got everything I could.

707
01:07:01,124 --> 01:07:02,860
What? Then what the hell was the,
"No, no, no, no!" for?

708
01:07:03,360 --> 01:07:04,128
That was for McCullen.

709
01:07:04,628 --> 01:07:06,931
-They were watching us.
-Okay. So what did you get?

710
01:07:07,432 --> 01:07:08,400
Actually, not that much. Just images.

711
01:07:08,900 --> 01:07:10,402
Come on, Frenchie. I thought you said
you was the best at this.

712
01:07:10,902 --> 01:07:11,803
-I am the best at this!
-All right.

713
01:07:12,303 --> 01:07:15,941
-Nobody can do what I just did.
-Okay.

714
01:07:16,442 --> 01:07:17,810
Wait, no.

715
01:07:18,310 --> 01:07:21,414
We didn't do it. We're the good guys.

716
01:07:21,915 --> 01:07:23,250
-Put your hands up, Rip.
-We don't have time for this!

717
01:07:23,750 --> 01:07:25,085
We're not allowed to engage
with friendly forces.

718
01:07:25,586 --> 01:07:28,089
They don't look too friendly to me.
I gotta get my boy.

719
01:07:28,589 --> 01:07:30,889
-Look, Captain...
-Rip!

720
01:07:55,621 --> 01:07:57,457
We're still trying to locate
the 3 remaining warheads, sir.

721
01:07:57,957 --> 01:08:00,360
-What's the status of the Joes?
-They've been detained.

722
01:08:00,861 --> 01:08:05,533
-The French are pretty upset.
-Of course they're upset.

723
01:08:06,033 --> 01:08:08,933
Get me the French Ambassador.

724
01:08:16,011 --> 01:08:18,414
...in a matter of seconds
by a strike by a missile...

725
01:08:18,915 --> 01:08:20,415
Hey, no, no!

726
01:08:21,518 --> 01:08:25,322
Please don't touch that!
That's my equipment. It's very...

727
01:08:25,823 --> 01:08:28,123
Okay, he's touching it.

728
01:08:28,759 --> 01:08:30,461
-Nice going, slick.
-It's not his fault.

729
01:08:30,962 --> 01:08:33,055
He's just emotional.

730
01:08:33,632 --> 01:08:35,334
-Here, let me look at that.
-I'm fine.

731
01:08:35,834 --> 01:08:38,734
Just trying to help. General!

732
01:08:43,177 --> 01:08:49,550
The French have agreed to let you all go
on the condition that none of you return.

733
01:08:50,051 --> 01:08:50,686
Ever.

734
01:08:51,186 --> 01:08:52,955
-Never?
-It could be worse.

735
01:08:53,455 --> 01:08:54,690
What do you mean by never?
Like, never, never, ever?

736
01:08:55,191 --> 01:08:56,259
There's more.

737
01:08:56,759 --> 01:08:59,929
All of you have been recalled
by your respective heads of state.

738
01:09:00,429 --> 01:09:03,700
Team Alpha is to return to the Pit.

739
01:09:04,201 --> 01:09:05,801
What about Duke?

740
01:09:12,677 --> 01:09:14,579
Call McCullen.
Tell him we have the 3 warheads.

741
01:09:15,080 --> 01:09:16,580
Right away.

742
01:09:18,852 --> 01:09:20,420
Why didn't you just kill me?

743
01:09:20,920 --> 01:09:23,390
McCullen has something special
in mind for you.

744
01:09:23,890 --> 01:09:25,390
McCullen.

745
01:09:27,228 --> 01:09:28,363
What happened to you?

746
01:09:28,863 --> 01:09:30,363
Now you care?

747
01:09:31,633 --> 01:09:33,133
Okay.

748
01:09:34,069 --> 01:09:35,569
I am sorry.

749
01:09:36,638 --> 01:09:38,638
I'm sorry about Rex.

750
01:09:39,342 --> 01:09:42,379
I'm sorry that I couldn't bring Rex home.

751
01:09:42,880 --> 01:09:46,817
And I'm so sorry
that I couldn't face you afterwards.

752
01:09:47,317 --> 01:09:51,317
Well, everybody's sorry
about something.

753
01:10:57,433 --> 01:10:58,868
Master!

754
01:10:59,368 --> 01:11:00,868
Master.

755
01:11:22,262 --> 01:11:24,131
Okay, so what about Duke?
We're just gonna forget about him?

756
01:11:24,632 --> 01:11:25,433
We've got our orders.

757
01:11:25,933 --> 01:11:27,468
Look, man,
what if it was one of your guys?

758
01:11:27,968 --> 01:11:30,071
What if it was Scarlett or Breaker?
What would you do then?

759
01:11:30,572 --> 01:11:32,541
Looks pretty remote.
Might be a good location for a base.

760
01:11:33,041 --> 01:11:35,411
Snow. That leaves us with what,
1/3 of the earth?

761
01:11:35,911 --> 01:11:37,411
Yeah.

762
01:11:39,282 --> 01:11:41,217
-Hey, is that McCullen's shadow?
-What you got?

763
01:11:41,717 --> 01:11:43,686
-Spherical trigonometry.
-I must have missed that class.

764
01:11:44,187 --> 01:11:45,756
If you know the height of the object,
the length of the shadow,

765
01:11:46,256 --> 01:11:47,291
and the time and date
that the image was captured,

766
01:11:47,791 --> 01:11:49,593
-you can figure out its location.
-That's why I missed that class.

767
01:11:50,094 --> 01:11:51,463
All right, Breaker, give it to me.
What have we got?

768
01:11:51,963 --> 01:11:56,768
Okay. McCullen is 180 centimeters tall.
His shadow is 46 centimeters.

769
01:11:57,269 --> 01:11:58,604
This image has decayed 6%,

770
01:11:59,104 --> 01:12:02,508
which means
it's 51 hours and 17 minutes old.

771
01:12:03,009 --> 01:12:04,445
That's at the polar icecap.

772
01:12:04,945 --> 01:12:06,469
-Heavy.
-Yep.

773
01:12:08,215 --> 01:12:08,783
What do you say, sir?

774
01:12:09,283 --> 01:12:12,187
I said you've been ordered back
to the Pit,

775
01:12:12,688 --> 01:12:18,494
but I didn't say when
and I didn't say which route to take.

776
01:12:18,995 --> 01:12:21,095
Maybe a northern one.

777
01:12:37,817 --> 01:12:38,985
That is a lot of ice.

778
01:12:39,485 --> 01:12:41,421
Thousands of miles across
and 10 stories thick.

779
01:12:41,921 --> 01:12:44,457
Locating McCullen's base will be
like finding a needle in a coal mine.

780
01:12:44,958 --> 01:12:46,961
-Haystack.
-Right.

781
01:12:47,461 --> 01:12:49,861
Haystack in a coal mine.

782
01:13:38,087 --> 01:13:41,187
No! McCullen has plans for him!

783
01:13:47,431 --> 01:13:48,931
Enough!

784
01:14:02,716 --> 01:14:04,351
And what was your plan?

785
01:14:04,851 --> 01:14:07,951
Run 3,000 miles across the ice?

786
01:14:12,494 --> 01:14:13,994
Stupid soldier.

787
01:14:22,472 --> 01:14:23,840
Move it.

788
01:14:24,340 --> 01:14:26,042
-That's strange.
-What?

789
01:14:26,543 --> 01:14:28,846
When they stole the weapons case,
I set my scanner

790
01:14:29,346 --> 01:14:32,216
to look out for the tracking beacon
in case it came back on.

791
01:14:32,717 --> 01:14:36,917
-And it just came back on.
-That's my boy!

792
01:14:56,578 --> 01:14:57,213
3 left.

793
01:14:57,713 --> 01:15:01,217
Take the warheads to the missiles.
I want them ready to launch in one hour.

794
01:15:01,718 --> 01:15:03,318
It will be done.

795
01:15:11,462 --> 01:15:14,462
My beautiful Lady of the Lake.

796
01:15:22,008 --> 01:15:23,608
This bother you?

797
01:15:25,279 --> 01:15:29,016
It's funny, isn't it? The entire balance
of power in the world about to shift,

798
01:15:29,516 --> 01:15:35,316
2 guys can still have a stare-down
over who gets the girl.

799
01:15:50,441 --> 01:15:52,177
I'm gonna make you very unhappy.

800
01:15:52,677 --> 01:15:55,677
-I'm already unhappy.
-Get up!

801
01:16:06,994 --> 01:16:09,630
Video from the Aqua Cam
is coming online now.

802
01:16:10,130 --> 01:16:11,399
Bloody hell.

803
01:16:11,899 --> 01:16:14,535
They've built a military base
under the polar icecap.

804
01:16:15,036 --> 01:16:17,539
It's the perfect location.
Nearly undetectable, easily defensible.

805
01:16:18,039 --> 01:16:20,209
-Duke's got to be in there somewhere.
-And the warheads.

806
01:16:20,710 --> 01:16:24,814
We have to find a quiet way
to get inside.

807
01:16:25,315 --> 01:16:27,685
Elevator cables.
They've got a surface entrance.

808
01:16:28,185 --> 01:16:32,623
Guys, there's something else.
Going to sonar view.

809
01:16:33,124 --> 01:16:35,026
They've got tunnels
running through the ice pack.

810
01:16:35,526 --> 01:16:37,396
Hey, look, they've got
their own attack subs.

811
01:16:37,897 --> 01:16:38,998
Okay, what's that?

812
01:16:39,498 --> 01:16:41,768
-Missile tubes.
-Must be for the nanomite warheads.

813
01:16:42,269 --> 01:16:45,139
Take us up. I'll create a distraction
from outside and keep them busy

814
01:16:45,639 --> 01:16:47,841
while you lot infiltrate the facility
from above. We'll find Duke...

815
01:16:48,342 --> 01:16:50,278
-Grab the warheads.
-Kill all the bad guys.

816
01:16:50,778 --> 01:16:53,581
As you all know,
Team Alpha is under direct orders

817
01:16:54,081 --> 01:16:56,117
to return to their
respective national bases.

818
01:16:56,618 --> 01:17:01,123
But I have something I need to do
which goes against all orders.

819
01:17:01,624 --> 01:17:03,960
So, if any of you decide
that you have to leave now,

820
01:17:04,460 --> 01:17:08,560
I will certainly not hold it against you.

821
01:17:17,242 --> 01:17:18,742
Okay, then.

822
01:17:19,478 --> 01:17:20,246
What are you gonna do
with the warheads?

823
01:17:20,746 --> 01:17:23,049
You take to your training well.
That's good.

824
01:17:23,549 --> 01:17:24,918
Still trying to develop intel.

825
01:17:25,419 --> 01:17:27,221
-So you won't mind telling me.
-Isn't it obvious?

826
01:17:27,721 --> 01:17:29,523
I'm a businessman.
I'm going to use them.

827
01:17:30,023 --> 01:17:32,092
Millions of people are gonna die
if you launch those warheads,

828
01:17:32,593 --> 01:17:33,228
so what is it that you want?

829
01:17:33,728 --> 01:17:38,033
To strike fear into the hearts of every
man, woman and child on the planet.

830
01:17:38,534 --> 01:17:40,369
Then they'll turn to the person
with the most power.

831
01:17:40,869 --> 01:17:42,104
You?

832
01:17:42,605 --> 01:17:43,707
No, not me.

833
01:17:44,207 --> 01:17:45,976
-You're not seeing the whole picture.
-Then tell me.

834
01:17:46,476 --> 01:17:49,776
I don't wanna spoil the surprise.

835
01:17:58,924 --> 01:17:59,525
Guests.

836
01:18:00,025 --> 01:18:02,461
Meet the genius
behind all my nanotechnology.

837
01:18:02,962 --> 01:18:05,665
Genius? You are too kind.

838
01:18:06,165 --> 01:18:08,902
As you can see,
we are loading my nanomite warheads

839
01:18:09,403 --> 01:18:10,838
into the high-V missiles.

840
01:18:11,338 --> 01:18:13,941
Once at maximum velocity, Mach 5,

841
01:18:14,442 --> 01:18:17,246
not even the Joes have
the technology to catch them.

842
01:18:17,746 --> 01:18:20,946
So, who's this? Another recruit?

843
01:18:21,851 --> 01:18:23,453
Albeit a rather unwilling one.

844
01:18:23,953 --> 01:18:27,453
I'll prepare him for the procedure.

845
01:18:47,614 --> 01:18:49,850
All teams, listen up,
this is General Hawk.

846
01:18:50,351 --> 01:18:53,655
The mission is a go.
I say again, the mission is a go.

847
01:18:54,156 --> 01:18:55,756
Good luck, Joes.

848
01:19:25,492 --> 01:19:27,661
-The teams have been deployed, sir.
-Get me a satellite uplink.

849
01:19:28,161 --> 01:19:33,161
I wanna see everything
that's going on down there.

850
01:19:43,480 --> 01:19:44,247
You picking up anything?

851
01:19:44,747 --> 01:19:48,847
Negative.
There's nothing on the scanner.

852
01:19:59,731 --> 01:20:02,431
-Nice shooting.
-Thank you.

853
01:20:03,369 --> 01:20:06,039
We're a long way from Miami.

854
01:20:06,540 --> 01:20:08,976
That's a Night Raven.
They actually built one.

855
01:20:09,476 --> 01:20:12,947
Looks fast.
That McCullen got some gadgets.

856
01:20:13,448 --> 01:20:18,787
MARS Industries manufactures
70% of all arms on this planet.

857
01:20:19,288 --> 01:20:20,983
70%.

858
01:20:22,057 --> 01:20:25,083
Did you know that, Duke?

859
01:20:25,695 --> 01:20:30,367
There are 2 sides to McCullen's operation,
the Sword and the Shield.

860
01:20:30,868 --> 01:20:32,937
The Sword creates and sells weaponry.

861
01:20:33,437 --> 01:20:37,442
The Shield creates defensive
technology, like high-tech bunkers,

862
01:20:37,943 --> 01:20:39,612
which are supposed
to protect one from anything

863
01:20:40,112 --> 01:20:42,615
from a nuclear blast
to a nanomite warhead.

864
01:20:43,116 --> 01:20:46,953
Unfortunately, the bunker
in which I took shelter

865
01:20:47,453 --> 01:20:48,755
was just a prototype.

866
01:20:49,256 --> 01:20:50,756
Who are you?

867
01:21:03,406 --> 01:21:04,906
Rex?

868
01:21:05,741 --> 01:21:07,944
You son of a bitch! Ana buried you!

869
01:21:08,445 --> 01:21:10,481
Moving ceremony, I'm sure.

870
01:21:10,981 --> 01:21:12,650
The 3-volley salute.

871
01:21:13,151 --> 01:21:15,754
Boots on the ground.
A folded flag in her arms.

872
01:21:16,254 --> 01:21:18,290
Why? Why didn't you just come in?

873
01:21:18,791 --> 01:21:21,891
Because I discovered something.

874
01:21:24,931 --> 01:21:27,263
...subject number 23.

875
01:21:29,135 --> 01:21:30,637
This will only hurt a little.

876
01:21:31,138 --> 01:21:33,141
What comes next, more so.

877
01:21:33,641 --> 01:21:35,710
Listen, Mindbender,
do whatever it takes.

878
01:21:36,211 --> 01:21:37,279
So will I.

879
01:21:37,779 --> 01:21:41,479
Remember, science requires sacrifice.

880
01:21:42,318 --> 01:21:45,722
-It's beautiful, isn't it?
-Stay where you are!

881
01:21:46,222 --> 01:21:48,822
Are you going to shoot me?

882
01:21:50,327 --> 01:21:52,830
These aren't chemical or nuclear,
are they?

883
01:21:53,330 --> 01:21:54,098
No.

884
01:21:54,599 --> 01:21:56,502
They're something much, much better.

885
01:21:57,002 --> 01:21:58,602
It is beautiful.

886
01:22:00,406 --> 01:22:02,742
Nanomites, it's beyond...

887
01:22:03,242 --> 01:22:05,879
It's light years ahead
of what anyone else is doing in the field.

888
01:22:06,380 --> 01:22:07,481
Proximity alert.

889
01:22:07,981 --> 01:22:13,181
Aerial attack imminent.
All personnel to the bunker.

890
01:22:16,357 --> 01:22:18,627
Come on. Come on! What?

891
01:22:19,128 --> 01:22:22,398
What are you doing?
Don't close that. Don't...

892
01:22:22,898 --> 01:22:26,598
If we live, I'll show you everything.

893
01:22:30,875 --> 01:22:34,379
We survived that blast, somewhat.

894
01:22:34,879 --> 01:22:38,783
And Dr. Mindbender and I escaped
with his research, which I perfected

895
01:22:39,284 --> 01:22:41,954
and which you will
now experience first-hand.

896
01:22:42,455 --> 01:22:44,324
Does Ana know about this? About you?

897
01:22:44,824 --> 01:22:47,384
No, and she never will.

898
01:22:49,963 --> 01:22:51,132
Commence the launch sequence.

899
01:22:51,632 --> 01:22:57,138
Commencing launch sequence.
T-minus 4, 3, 2, 1.

900
01:22:57,639 --> 01:22:59,939
Ignite primary engines.

901
01:23:00,643 --> 01:23:02,343
We have ignition.

902
01:23:08,051 --> 01:23:11,151
They're launching the missiles!

903
01:23:46,129 --> 01:23:48,999
We lost the Beijing missile.
Warhead 3 is down, sir.

904
01:23:49,500 --> 01:23:51,135
-Alert all defenses.
-Yes, sir.

905
01:23:51,635 --> 01:23:53,135
He's here.

906
01:24:04,550 --> 01:24:06,519
-What about the other two?
-We gotta find the kill switches.

907
01:24:07,020 --> 01:24:07,788
They're already way too far out of range.

908
01:24:08,288 --> 01:24:10,591
Somebody has to get up there
and shoot those things down.

909
01:24:11,091 --> 01:24:14,390
Well, I guess that's me.

910
01:24:15,196 --> 01:24:16,097
-Sir.
-What is it?

911
01:24:16,597 --> 01:24:18,133
STRATCOM is tracking 3 warheads

912
01:24:18,634 --> 01:24:20,002
that have just launched off
the polar icecap.

913
01:24:20,502 --> 01:24:21,103
One was downed immediately.

914
01:24:21,603 --> 01:24:23,105
The other 2 are currently entering
the upper atmosphere.

915
01:24:23,605 --> 01:24:24,640
We need to get you
down to the bunker, sir.

916
01:24:25,141 --> 01:24:29,680
Well, they haven't made any demands.
What's their plan?

917
01:24:30,181 --> 01:24:32,183
Now, this is very cool.

918
01:24:32,683 --> 01:24:34,585
-Yeah, but can you fly it?
-I can fly anything.

919
01:24:35,085 --> 01:24:37,221
You just find a way
to guide me to those warheads.

920
01:24:37,722 --> 01:24:40,222
-Right. Ripcord...
-Yeah?

921
01:24:42,895 --> 01:24:44,531
-Good luck.
-Thanks.

922
01:24:45,031 --> 01:24:46,366
-Hey, do me a favor.
-Yeah?

923
01:24:46,866 --> 01:24:49,266
-Save Duke.
-You got it.

924
01:24:58,513 --> 01:25:00,013
Let's go!

925
01:25:11,127 --> 01:25:13,030
The floor is pressure-plated
and laser-protected.

926
01:25:13,531 --> 01:25:19,270
Anything larger than a quarter
that touches that floor gets fried.

927
01:25:19,771 --> 01:25:24,071
You left me for dead, Duke,
and look at me.

928
01:25:25,144 --> 01:25:29,844
Now you'll know what it's like
to be a monster.

929
01:25:35,189 --> 01:25:38,289
-We don't have much time.
-Ana?

930
01:25:46,969 --> 01:25:48,469
Oh, my God.

931
01:25:50,307 --> 01:25:52,476
-Ana!
-Security, to the operating chamber!

932
01:25:52,976 --> 01:25:55,112
-Rex!
-I press this, she dies.

933
01:25:55,613 --> 01:25:58,450
-You did this to your own sister!
-I loved my sister.

934
01:25:58,950 --> 01:26:03,655
Do you have any idea the state
she was in with me dead, you gone?

935
01:26:04,156 --> 01:26:07,256
Have you ever felt truly alone?

936
01:26:08,061 --> 01:26:11,799
I gave her a way to deal with the pain.
I gave her purpose.

937
01:26:12,300 --> 01:26:14,736
You could have stopped all of this
just by letting her know you were alive!

938
01:26:15,236 --> 01:26:17,038
Science requires sacrifice.

939
01:26:17,538 --> 01:26:19,574
All she's done was because of you!

940
01:26:20,075 --> 01:26:22,778
And because of you, Duke.
You abandoned her.

941
01:26:23,278 --> 01:26:28,778
-Let's not forget that point.
-I'm gonna kill you, Rex.

942
01:26:31,121 --> 01:26:32,757
-Is she still alive?
-For now.

943
01:26:33,257 --> 01:26:35,526
I thought we had complete control.
You said this couldn't happen.

944
01:26:36,027 --> 01:26:36,662
I didn't think it could.

945
01:26:37,162 --> 01:26:40,399
I've never seen anyone override
the programming, even momentarily.

946
01:26:40,899 --> 01:26:42,734
She did this for him.

947
01:26:43,235 --> 01:26:46,935
The pain must have been excruciating.

948
01:26:55,350 --> 01:26:56,551
What you'll have to do

949
01:26:57,051 --> 01:27:01,990
is to rewire the laser panel's brain
by carefully...

950
01:27:02,491 --> 01:27:05,194
-Or you can just stab it.
-This is Scarlett. We're in.

951
01:27:05,695 --> 01:27:06,997
Deploy the SHARCs!

952
01:27:07,497 --> 01:27:08,365
Detaching SHARCs 1-3...

953
01:27:08,865 --> 01:27:11,368
Detaching SHARCs
Alpha, Bravo, Charlie, Delta.

954
01:27:11,869 --> 01:27:13,972
-Full speed ahead.
-Detaching SHARCs.

955
01:27:14,472 --> 01:27:17,475
SHARCs Victor, Franklin, Tango
into flanking positions.

956
01:27:17,976 --> 01:27:21,376
All right, boys. Attack formation.

957
01:27:33,727 --> 01:27:36,230
Fan out.
Wait until the Joes break formation.

958
01:27:36,731 --> 01:27:39,461
Stay tight. Here they come.

959
01:28:02,027 --> 01:28:06,527
-Fire up the pulse cannon!
-We're on it, sir.

960
01:28:07,867 --> 01:28:08,869
-I'll do it!
-Put it down!

961
01:28:09,369 --> 01:28:11,104
Your choice, Duke.

962
01:28:11,604 --> 01:28:13,804
Charging pulse cannon.

963
01:28:25,788 --> 01:28:27,090
Everybody stay tight on the enemy craft.

964
01:28:27,590 --> 01:28:29,059
Don't let that cannon catch you
out in the open.

965
01:28:29,559 --> 01:28:30,860
Bogey at 10 o'clock.

966
01:28:31,361 --> 01:28:33,698
I'm hit! I'm hit! I'm hit!

967
01:28:34,198 --> 01:28:39,798
Missile 2, all telemetry
and propulsion systems nominal.

968
01:29:05,869 --> 01:29:07,704
-Ripcord, can you hear me?
-Loud and clear, buddy.

969
01:29:08,204 --> 01:29:10,707
Doing Mach 6 and loving it!

970
01:29:11,207 --> 01:29:15,279
Come on, girl.
Time to show me what you got.

971
01:29:15,780 --> 01:29:18,283
Okay, Rip, I have the coordinates
of the other 2 warheads.

972
01:29:18,784 --> 01:29:21,053
The closest target is Moscow.
You'll have to hit that one first.

973
01:29:21,553 --> 01:29:23,853
Target 2 is Washington.

974
01:29:27,360 --> 01:29:28,361
You'll be safe down in this bunker, sir.

975
01:29:28,861 --> 01:29:31,197
-How soon before it strikes the city?
-17 minutes, sir.

976
01:29:31,698 --> 01:29:33,701
-It's all up to the Joes now.
-Please hurry, Mr. President.

977
01:29:34,201 --> 01:29:37,301
We need to get you buttoned up.

978
01:29:53,991 --> 01:29:56,461
General Hawk, we've lost our engines.
We're completely disabled.

979
01:29:56,961 --> 01:29:59,664
Somebody take out that damn cannon.
There's 200 Joes on that sub.

980
01:30:00,165 --> 01:30:01,701
We're on it, sir. All right, Snake,

981
01:30:02,201 --> 01:30:03,102
the cannon control room
should be right there,

982
01:30:03,602 --> 01:30:06,005
where all the laser conduits converge.

983
01:30:06,506 --> 01:30:10,077
Did you think she loved you?
Did you imagine your life with her?

984
01:30:10,577 --> 01:30:12,045
All I know is,
neither one of you deserve her.

985
01:30:12,546 --> 01:30:16,546
-That's it. She dies!
-Don't do it, Rex!

986
01:30:28,064 --> 01:30:29,564
Come on.

987
01:30:31,635 --> 01:30:34,405
I'm gonna get you out of here.

988
01:30:34,905 --> 01:30:36,173
Get up!

989
01:30:36,674 --> 01:30:38,874
You're coming with me.

990
01:30:54,595 --> 01:30:57,565
Ripcord, the Moscow missile
will impact in 4 minutes.

991
01:30:58,065 --> 01:30:59,567
All right, I got a visual on it.

992
01:31:00,068 --> 01:31:01,568
Dead ahead.

993
01:31:02,137 --> 01:31:04,006
You have to knock it down
before it re-enters the atmosphere.

994
01:31:04,506 --> 01:31:05,875
If those nanomites hit the ground,
it's all over.

995
01:31:06,376 --> 01:31:07,277
They'll destroy the whole city.

996
01:31:07,777 --> 01:31:08,912
Houston, we have a problem.

997
01:31:09,412 --> 01:31:12,549
-The fire controls are not in here.
-What do you mean, not in there?

998
01:31:13,050 --> 01:31:15,086
I mean, I don't see them anywhere.

999
01:31:15,586 --> 01:31:16,554
It must be voice-activated.

1000
01:31:17,054 --> 01:31:18,554
Okay. Fire!

1001
01:31:20,292 --> 01:31:23,386
Shoot! Blast away! Bust a cap!

1002
01:31:24,964 --> 01:31:27,667
-Nothing's happening!
-I bet it's in a different language.

1003
01:31:28,167 --> 01:31:30,937
Wait a minute. McCullen is Scottish.
Maybe the plane responds to Celtic.

1004
01:31:31,438 --> 01:31:34,108
-Try Teine.
-What?

1005
01:31:34,608 --> 01:31:39,808
-Teine. It's Celt, Scottish for fire.
-Okay, got it.

1006
01:31:47,424 --> 01:31:49,393
Nice going, ace.
You just saved Moscow.

1007
01:31:49,893 --> 01:31:54,493
Just doing my job.
Now guide me to Washington.

1008
01:31:59,036 --> 01:32:01,739
Yeah. Yeah, thanks, that's great news.
I'll let him know.

1009
01:32:02,240 --> 01:32:04,677
Sir, one of the Joes shot down
the warhead heading for Moscow.

1010
01:32:05,177 --> 01:32:06,677
Thank God.

1011
01:32:11,150 --> 01:32:14,250
What are you doing? Oh, my God!

1012
01:32:18,626 --> 01:32:20,126
It's done.

1013
01:32:32,976 --> 01:32:37,081
Hello, Mr. President.
Mr. McCullen sends his regards.

1014
01:32:37,582 --> 01:32:39,082
Oh, my God.

1015
01:32:40,952 --> 01:32:44,352
So, that's what this is all about.

1016
01:32:45,190 --> 01:32:46,759
All right. Keep tight, boys.

1017
01:32:47,259 --> 01:32:51,259
All guns on that cannon.
Torpedoes away!

1018
01:33:01,943 --> 01:33:02,678
I've just lost my wingman.

1019
01:33:03,178 --> 01:33:05,778
Retargeting Joe submarine.

1020
01:33:07,750 --> 01:33:09,350
I've got a shot.

1021
01:33:30,143 --> 01:33:33,581
Pulse cannon fault. Pulse cannon fault.

1022
01:33:34,081 --> 01:33:36,106
Cannon now offline.

1023
01:33:46,462 --> 01:33:53,162
-The whole damn system's down.
-I'm trying to bring it back online.

1024
01:33:56,774 --> 01:33:58,274
Now you die.

1025
01:34:20,802 --> 01:34:21,670
Launch immediately.

1026
01:34:22,170 --> 01:34:26,770
-Chart a course up to the ice pack.
-Yes, sir.

1027
01:34:39,724 --> 01:34:43,294
-We gotta go after Rex and McCullen.
-How could it be Rex?

1028
01:34:43,795 --> 01:34:45,264
Hey, Scarlett, it's Duke!

1029
01:34:45,764 --> 01:34:50,364
-He looks fine.
-But what's he doing with her?

1030
01:34:59,648 --> 01:35:05,387
Okay, we got a track on McCullen's sub.
He's headed up into the ice pack.

1031
01:35:05,888 --> 01:35:07,488
Duke, behind us!

1032
01:35:10,760 --> 01:35:12,529
Looks like they're onto us.
Ana, shoot those guys.

1033
01:35:13,030 --> 01:35:14,530
Love to.

1034
01:35:58,415 --> 01:36:02,386
When our master was killed,
you took a vow of silence.

1035
01:36:02,887 --> 01:36:06,087
Now you will die without a word.

1036
01:36:09,195 --> 01:36:11,131
All right, the second one in my sights.

1037
01:36:11,632 --> 01:36:18,932
Okay, Rip, you only got 30 seconds
before it enters the lower atmosphere.

1038
01:36:28,017 --> 01:36:29,517
I got you!

1039
01:36:37,328 --> 01:36:38,429
-Ripcord, you missed.
-The warhead has entered

1040
01:36:38,929 --> 01:36:39,531
the lower atmosphere.

1041
01:36:40,031 --> 01:36:43,731
I know, I know! I'm on it, I'm on it!

1042
01:36:45,904 --> 01:36:47,404
Shit!

1043
01:36:49,108 --> 01:36:51,244
-I can't shake these guys.
-Duke, I'm out!

1044
01:36:51,744 --> 01:36:53,947
-All right, let's see what we got here.
-Black Ray, Eliminator, LAW.

1045
01:36:54,448 --> 01:36:58,548
Laser Artillery Weapon.
That sounds good.

1046
01:37:03,491 --> 01:37:04,293
-Scarlett!
-Hey, Duke!

1047
01:37:04,793 --> 01:37:05,460
I'm going after McCullen and Rex.

1048
01:37:05,961 --> 01:37:06,629
You guys better get the hell out of there.

1049
01:37:07,129 --> 01:37:08,765
I can't. Rip has one more warhead
to take down.

1050
01:37:09,265 --> 01:37:10,965
Rip, where is he?

1051
01:37:17,608 --> 01:37:23,408
The missile's just gone drone.
It's going in for the kill!

1052
01:38:22,483 --> 01:38:24,519
Sir, there's a hostile Mantis craft
coming up behind us.

1053
01:38:25,020 --> 01:38:27,120
-Seal the door.
-Sir.

1054
01:38:32,762 --> 01:38:34,262
There you are.

1055
01:38:44,209 --> 01:38:47,009
One got through. I hit them!

1056
01:38:48,781 --> 01:38:50,681
Duke! They're back!

1057
01:38:54,488 --> 01:38:56,820
Going hot in 3, 2, 1.

1058
01:39:09,572 --> 01:39:11,841
There's gotta be another way around
to Rex and McCullen.

1059
01:39:12,342 --> 01:39:16,342
Charting new course for alternate route.

1060
01:39:22,753 --> 01:39:24,356
20 seconds until impact.

1061
01:39:24,857 --> 01:39:27,457
Come on, come on, come on.

1062
01:39:29,762 --> 01:39:30,998
You're too close, Rip! Back off!

1063
01:39:31,498 --> 01:39:36,098
Actually, I think
I'm just about close enough.

1064
01:39:53,257 --> 01:39:58,957
He's taking the nanomites
back into the upper atmosphere.

1065
01:40:04,937 --> 01:40:06,906
Ripcord, get out of that plane!

1066
01:40:07,406 --> 01:40:09,101
Almost there!

1067
01:40:11,745 --> 01:40:13,945
Eject, Ripcord, eject!

1068
01:40:23,692 --> 01:40:26,295
He did it. He actually did it.

1069
01:40:26,795 --> 01:40:28,295
Ripcord?

1070
01:40:30,500 --> 01:40:32,000
Ripcord?

1071
01:40:34,370 --> 01:40:35,038
Ripcord!

1072
01:40:35,539 --> 01:40:39,039
Didn't I ask you not to yell at me?

1073
01:40:40,144 --> 01:40:43,948
Everybody, listen up! We still have
a lot of Joes out there in harm's way.

1074
01:40:44,449 --> 01:40:46,649
Let's bring them home.

1075
01:40:48,988 --> 01:40:52,459
-Did it work?
-Yes, yes, it worked.

1076
01:40:52,960 --> 01:40:57,832
Good. Because I think
I'm about to get arrested, again.

1077
01:40:58,332 --> 01:40:58,933
Don't move!

1078
01:40:59,434 --> 01:41:00,602
-Hey, hey, same team, same team!
-Hands up!

1079
01:41:01,102 --> 01:41:02,370
Same team.

1080
01:41:02,870 --> 01:41:04,570
Okay, okay, okay.

1081
01:41:10,112 --> 01:41:12,849
-What's our status?
-We've lost aft thrusters and the sonar.

1082
01:41:13,350 --> 01:41:16,587
-We're running blind.
-Kill them. Kill all the Joes.

1083
01:41:17,088 --> 01:41:21,188
-Detonate the ice pack.
-Right away, sir.

1084
01:41:28,266 --> 01:41:31,003
They're telling the other ships to abort.
He's gonna blow the ice pack.

1085
01:41:31,504 --> 01:41:33,707
This is Duke calling all Joes.
The ice pack's coming down!

1086
01:41:34,207 --> 01:41:34,975
There's a ton of steel and ice

1087
01:41:35,476 --> 01:41:37,876
-headed your way!
-What?

1088
01:41:40,514 --> 01:41:44,114
Everybody, pull back! Pull back now!

1089
01:41:49,492 --> 01:41:53,392
Door! The door, the door! Get the door!

1090
01:41:54,965 --> 01:41:56,465
Come on!

1091
01:42:03,641 --> 01:42:09,981
Ana, we could get out of here right now,
free and clear, safe and sound.

1092
01:42:10,482 --> 01:42:13,782
-Let's get them.
-That's my girl.

1093
01:42:26,201 --> 01:42:31,707
-This is cutting it close, Duke.
-I'm not letting those 2 get away.

1094
01:42:32,208 --> 01:42:35,408
Come on, guys, get out of there!

1095
01:42:41,820 --> 01:42:43,320
Snake!

1096
01:43:23,268 --> 01:43:25,738
-This is Scarlett. We're all clear.
-This is Duke. We're clear, too.

1097
01:43:26,238 --> 01:43:27,865
Yo, Joe!

1098
01:43:33,913 --> 01:43:35,413
Yeah!

1099
01:43:52,701 --> 01:43:55,772
Now that we have
a moment to ourselves,

1100
01:43:56,273 --> 01:43:57,308
I've designed something

1101
01:43:57,808 --> 01:44:01,008
-especially for you, James.
-No!

1102
01:44:02,346 --> 01:44:05,246
This will only hurt a little.

1103
01:44:06,118 --> 01:44:09,554
What comes next, more so.

1104
01:44:14,627 --> 01:44:18,027
Nanomites, perfect little healers.

1105
01:44:31,581 --> 01:44:34,884
I've finally taken my place
in a long line of McCullens.

1106
01:44:35,385 --> 01:44:41,585
James McCullen is no more.
Now you are Destro.

1107
01:44:43,862 --> 01:44:46,362
What have you done to me?

1108
01:44:53,640 --> 01:44:59,840
The time has come for the cobra
to rise up and reveal himself.

1109
01:45:01,983 --> 01:45:06,283
You will call me Commander.

1110
01:45:17,902 --> 01:45:22,173
This is Captain Duke Hauser.
Prepare to be boarded.

1111
01:45:22,674 --> 01:45:24,174
Sir.

1112
01:45:26,544 --> 01:45:30,783
You are relentless, Duke.
I'll give you that much.

1113
01:45:31,284 --> 01:45:34,654
And what's to stop me
from blowing you out of the water?

1114
01:45:35,155 --> 01:45:39,355
Self-preservation. I'm taking you in, Rex.

1115
01:45:42,363 --> 01:45:44,194
You and what army?

1116
01:45:45,600 --> 01:45:47,100
My army.

1117
01:46:02,920 --> 01:46:07,020
You know, Duke,
this has only just begun.

1118
01:46:12,198 --> 01:46:14,598
I'll be waiting for you.

1119
01:46:26,281 --> 01:46:28,717
I've never seen encoding like this.
I mean, physically, she's fine,

1120
01:46:29,218 --> 01:46:31,454
but when Rex programmed them,
he sure didn't want them taken out.

1121
01:46:31,954 --> 01:46:33,890
-So there's nothing you can do for her?
-It'll take some time,

1122
01:46:34,390 --> 01:46:36,790
but we'll take them out.

1123
01:46:41,265 --> 01:46:42,467
Till we get those things
out of your head,

1124
01:46:42,967 --> 01:46:44,636
looks like you're gonna be
seeing a lot of me around here.

1125
01:46:45,136 --> 01:46:49,274
You can't save me, Duke.
No one can, not after all I've done.

1126
01:46:49,775 --> 01:46:51,975
Look, that wasn't you.

1127
01:46:54,514 --> 01:46:57,014
I'm not giving up on you.

1128
01:47:30,623 --> 01:47:32,825
-Man, we look good.
-Yeah, well, you better get used to it.

1129
01:47:33,325 --> 01:47:35,695
Heavy Duty thinks you guys
ought to stick around permanently.

1130
01:47:36,196 --> 01:47:36,997
So, you're asking us, right?

1131
01:47:37,497 --> 01:47:38,198
Yeah, 'cause he didn't sound
like he was asking.

1132
01:47:38,698 --> 01:47:39,433
'Cause you gotta be asked
to join the G.I. Joes.

1133
01:47:39,933 --> 01:47:41,268
I'm asking.

1134
01:47:41,769 --> 01:47:42,437
Well, I'm in.

1135
01:47:42,937 --> 01:47:47,609
-How do you feel about this?
-I feel very em...emotional.

1136
01:47:48,110 --> 01:47:51,180
All Joes mobilize and ready check
for Operation Mongoose.

1137
01:47:51,680 --> 01:47:54,550
All ground transports,
rendezvous at Base Brothers Grimm.

1138
01:47:55,051 --> 01:47:57,554
All Howler Hunters will rendezvous
at Base Roman Ruin.

1139
01:47:58,054 --> 01:47:59,654
Good luck, Joes.

1140
01:48:31,594 --> 01:48:33,262
Mr. President, it's good to see you.

1141
01:48:33,762 --> 01:48:35,231
-Thank you. And you.
-It's nice to have you back safely, sir.

1142
01:48:35,732 --> 01:48:36,934
-Thank you. John.
-Welcome back, sir.

1143
01:48:37,434 --> 01:48:40,734
Thank you. Thank you all so much.

1
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:01,401
<i>Some people swear there's
no beauty left in the world. No magic.</i>

2
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:05,770
<i>Then how do you explain the entire world
coming together on one night...</i>

3
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:09,726
<i>...to celebrate the hope of a new year?</i>

4
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,407
Ready.

5
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,686
Pull!

6
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,367
Ease it off. Ease it. Gently.

7
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:26,920
Well done, boys. We'll pack up the tarp.
Looks like it's gonna be a beautiful day.

8
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:29,208
Hello, Your Majesty. Ha-ha-ha.

9
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,250
<i>We wanna see a show of strength...</i>

10
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:33,169
<i>...from the
New York City Police Department.</i>

11
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:44,166
<i>Good morning,
this is Ryan Seacrest here in New York...</i>

12
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:49,247
<i>...where the crowds of revelers are already
beginning to arrive in Times Square.</i>

13
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:52,210
<i>I'll be coming at you all day on radio...</i>

14
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:58,402
<i>...and all night live from the center
of it all, so bundle up and stay tuned.</i>

15
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:11,406
Good morning, Claire!
They need you up here for an interview.

16
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:16,009
This is Claire Morgan. She's in charge.

17
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,082
Mind giving us a sound bite
for the newscast?

18
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,850
No, I'd be happy to.

19
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,324
I'm talking to Claire Morgan, the new vice
president of the Times Square Alliance.

20
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,891
So big night.

21
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:31,082
Well, I'd say that's an understatement.

22
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:34,926
Over a billion people all over the world
will have their eyes on us tonight...

23
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:40,405
...as the ball drops, so I'd say that
qualifies as a very big night.

24
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:43,163
Am I looking in the right spot
for camera?

25
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,130
Oh, um...

26
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,367
We're radio.

27
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,841
Right. Of course.

28
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,164
This is 14th and Park.

29
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:07,050
Oh! Oh! Uhh.

30
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,806
Are you all right, lady? Are you all right?

31
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,527
Here.

32
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:15,126
No, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine. Go away.

33
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:36,008
Yeah, what's up, girls? How you doing?
All right?

34
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,448
Yo, I see you, player. Ha.

35
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,484
Oh, oh, hey, Happy New Year.
Happy New Year.

36
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,051
Yeah, you too.

37
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,601
Sign this, but you can't check in
until tonight.

38
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,524
No problem. We'll be back tonight.

39
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,206
- We're gonna win the money.
- Oh, of course you are.

40
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,521
What money?

41
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,924
Oh, the first baby delivered in the new
year at this hospital gets 25 grand.

42
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,811
No, no, no, honey.
I think it's much less than that.

43
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:07,804
- No, it's 25 grand.
- Twenty-five grand?

44
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:11,282
Honey, you're mistaken. It's much less.

45
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:16,002
Plus, after taxes and all the red tape,
you end up with no money.

46
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,767
Did I mention the news cameras
in your face right after giving birth?

47
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:22,127
That's horrible. It's not worth it at all.

48
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:26,166
It's 25 grand. They could put the camera
in my hoo-ha and it'd be worth it.

49
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,401
In your hoo-ha!

50
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,483
In my hoo-ha.
- Ha-ha-ha.

51
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:30,801
Mr. and Mrs. Byrne?

52
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,371
- That's us.
- Right this way.

53
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,531
Come on, Grace. Let's go home.

54
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,040
Hmm.

55
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,568
Okay. Let's figure out how to induce.

56
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:49,161
- I will ask the Internet right now.
- By command.

57
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,243
This could pay off my student loan.

58
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:02,601
Okay, honey, the hallway looks great.
Very festive.

59
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:05,081
This could be a little higher.
Hand me that tape.

60
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,762
Here you go. It looks beautiful.
You did a nice job.

61
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:12,606
Why you volunteered to decorate the floor
I'll never know, but it looks great.

62
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:13,807
Oh, hush up.

63
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,729
Come on, we gotta get dressed for work.

64
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,928
- Let's call in sick.
- Mm.

65
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,163
- Hey, Paul.
- My dog.

66
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:31,368
- What are we doing tonight?
- You're working.

67
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,965
I'm not. So leave me alone.

68
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,841
Randy, listen to me, don't do this
right now. Don't go into your black hole.

69
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,571
It's midnight on New Year's Eve.

70
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,529
<i>We have to do something.
Not an option.</i>

71
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,844
<i>What, are you still on this anti-New Year's
kick, bro? Get over yourself. Now.</i>

72
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,722
You know what? It's not a kick.
It's a core tenet of my being.

73
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,882
Like I said, I get the day off...

74
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:58,802
...so I'm gonna hang in our apartment
by myself and do nothing, and love it.

75
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:02,689
It's my job as your best friend
to just ignore you right now...

76
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,848
...because you sound crazy.

77
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:08,721
I'm not being crazy!

78
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:14,731
Okay, I'm gonna find something so epic
that you will not be able to say no.

79
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,844
Hmm.

80
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:21,726
I got a funny feeling, Paul,
that I'm gonna say no.

81
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:25,726
You want to throw the challenge flag
in my face? Okay. I'll call you back.

82
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:26,927
Save your minutes.

83
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,646
Now we're talking.

84
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:35,484
By the power vested in me
by the state of Connecticut...

85
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:40,601
...Rory and Trish,
I now pronounce you man and wife.

86
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:43,331
You may give kisses to the missus.

87
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,650
My cousin will pay you.

88
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:51,730
Oh. Congratulations to both of you.
That was just beautiful.

89
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,485
Thank you all for coming.

90
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:57,845
We wanted to save money
for the honeymoon.

91
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,570
Well, you're the last of us, Sam.

92
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:07,725
Roam the plains of Manhattan and carry on
the legacy of late-night barhopping...

93
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:10,724
...and casual sex with random women
in good shoes.

94
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,611
- Which Rory will never know again.
- Mm.

95
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,962
For better or worse, I can see why
the man's crazy about you.

96
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,565
Aww.

97
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,727
I'm out of here.

98
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:25,082
- You can't stay for breakfast?
- Rain check.

99
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:28,050
Office has been calling all morning.
I really gotta get back.

100
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,885
- I got that big speech tonight.
- What about the girl?

101
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:33,281
- What girl?
- The one you met last New Year's Eve?

102
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,649
- Are you gonna meet her tonight?
- It was a year ago. We've moved on.

103
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,086
Hey, look at you two.

104
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,611
All married.

105
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,005
- Here they come!
- Congratulations!

106
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,605
No, no, no. These two. Here.

107
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,569
- All right. I'll see you.
- Bye, Sam.

108
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:50,326
Hey, there's someone out there
for you too, buddy.

109
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,891
All right.

110
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,447
Okay.

111
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:11,048
All right. Our first event
with linen napkins.

112
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:15,410
Not only are we now eco-friendly, but this
will be our biggest A-list party to date.

113
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:19,406
I know it's cold, okay? But we cannot
mess this up. So you gotta focus.

114
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:22,285
- Where is Ava?
- She thinks she saw a celebrity somewhere.

115
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,801
There's gonna be more celebrities
here than rehab.

116
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:28,282
Okay, Sunil, make sure we have
all the booze on this list.

117
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:31,927
Find Ava and then I'll meet you
in the lobby after I scout the kitchen.

118
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:35,091
Ava!
- Take a picture with the bus.

119
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:38,329
- I'm freaking out.
- Ava, there is no time for freaking out.

120
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:43,202
I can't help it. Do you see that bus?
I saw it when I went to his concert.

121
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,486
It's Jensen!

122
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,846
That's Jensen's bus?

123
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,130
The Jensen?

124
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,726
That's fantastic.

125
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,610
- I love it.
- Aah!

126
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,281
- Ohh!
- Yee!

127
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,726
Keep jumping!

128
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,803
You are very sexy, but don't stop.

129
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:01,281
Bouncy, bouncy, bouncy!

130
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:07,967
<i>Now don't be sad</i>

131
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:14,330
<i>'Cause two out of three ain't bad.</i>

132
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,608
<i>Jensen! Jensen! Jensen!</i>

133
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,246
You know, I know him personally.

134
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:27,323
Everybody, let's get as much prep
done in the kitchen as possible.

135
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:30,563
And any sauces that need to get done
can start now.

136
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,961
And I'll check the deliveries
up in the lobby. Oh.

137
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:37,250
Anyone who can, can you please help Sunil
and Ava unload the truck? That'd be great.

138
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:43,403
<i>Ay-ay-ay. Laura.
You're not going to believe who is here.</i>

139
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,647
Jensen.

140
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:48,168
<i>How did you know? Are you psychotic?</i>

141
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:51,211
It's "psychic." And do me a favor.
If you see him...

142
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:55,564
...tell him to avoid the blond in
the kitchen with the really big knife.

143
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:58,007
<i>Ay, Laura, do you know him?</i>

144
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,842
It's good to see you, Laura.

145
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,526
<i>Are you still there?</i>

146
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:17,924
<i>Do you think Jensen will sign a banana?
I don't have any paper.</i>

147
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:25,764
All right. Working on those
resolutions, huh?

148
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,571
- No.
- Okay.

149
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,042
I have a delivery here
for Mr. Jonathan Cox.

150
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,611
Do you work here?

151
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,762
No. I work for a courier service.

152
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:39,402
I've been delivering packages to you
for about, I don't know, a year now.

153
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:43,167
But I think this is maybe the first time
you've ever looked me in the eye.

154
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,560
How you doing?

155
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:46,967
Sorry.

156
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:50,243
That's actually an old resolution.
Make more eye contact.

157
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:53,568
So those were New Year's
resolutions, huh?

158
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,848
Looks like a long list.
You better get on it.

159
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,241
I don't know, maybe next year.

160
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:03,290
Whoa. Jeez! Are you serious?

161
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:06,081
That is a hot ticket.

162
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,131
- Really?
- It's amazing.

163
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,642
They have the best food, the best music.

164
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,609
They got so many single girls.

165
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:17,447
And it's a masquerade, so you don't even
have to worry about their faces.

166
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,807
You kind of just use your imagination.

167
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:22,930
If anybody tries to kick you out,
or even asks who you are...

168
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:25,606
...you just straight-up lie.
What are they gonna do?

169
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:26,921
It's brilliant.

170
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,600
It's like Facebook, but real.

171
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,730
I remember who you are now.

172
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,245
Right, exactly.

173
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:36,285
Anyways, I would give my left...

174
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,768
Well, maybe next year.

175
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,563
Oh, there she is.

176
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,843
- You ready?
- Let's go talk to them.

177
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,526
- Hey, Hailey. You good?
- Yeah, we're good, Seth.

178
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,409
All right. Well, let's go, fellas.

179
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:09,121
We need to scout our pen on 54th
and head home to gear up for tonight.

180
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,726
- I'm gonna see you there, right?
- Yeah, definitely.

181
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:14,565
- Well, I'll see you there.
- See you.

182
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:17,648
- Ooh.
- You are so gonna kiss Seth tonight!

183
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:22,129
I really just, like, haven't even thought
about it at all. It's no big deal.

184
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,486
Do you know how to kiss?

185
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:25,927
They have a video on the Internet
that shows you.

186
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:29,687
Two. One for regular kissing,
and one for passionate kissing.

187
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:34,562
All right, guys. Yeah, I know how to kiss, so it's fine.
It's not a big deal. Okay, we...

188
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,803
Hey, what about your mom?
What's she doing?

189
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,450
Got it!

190
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:45,367
Oh, and remember, it's just a quarter of an
inch at the center back of the collar, okay?

191
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,249
Okay, let me take a look at that.

192
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,129
Kim, is that your New Year's dress?

193
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:53,683
Oh, it's just something I'm working on
for a rainy day.

194
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:57,049
You should wear it tonight.
Maybe you'll scare up a little action.

195
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,406
That's highly doubtful.

196
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:02,485
The only action I've got is Hailey and me
watching the ball drop at midnight.

197
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:06,042
Last New Year's Eve she was
with her father. So it's my turn.

198
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:09,603
- Wanna join us?
- Wow, really tempting.

199
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,809
I don't think you understand.
Hailey likes staying in with me.

200
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,325
All dancers on-stage!
- Go.

201
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:17,251
- Thank you. Thank you.
- You're welcome.

202
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,805
Five, six, seven, eight.

203
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:42,121
<i>- New York.</i>
<i>- New Rochelle.</i>

204
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,368
<i>- New Brunswick.</i>
- New York... New York City.

205
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:45,567
<i>New Haven.</i>

206
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,091
<i>New Britain.</i>

207
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,405
<i>New Hartford.</i>

208
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,087
<i>New Jersey?</i>

209
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,930
New York!

210
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,764
<i>New York. Turn right.</i>

211
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,843
<i>Left for New York.</i>

212
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,885
Oh! Oh.

213
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,280
Oh, my nose.

214
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,930
<i>Airbags deployed.</i>

215
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,931
<i>The genny truck's not arrived yet.</i>

216
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:11,731
Will someone tell me why it isn't here yet?

217
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:14,247
Make sure Jensen's on schedule
for his soundcheck.

218
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,767
He's playing some party,
but this is Times Square.

219
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,285
She's a little on edge today.

220
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,204
<i>Ready for the confetti test.</i>

221
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,010
Brendan.

222
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:25,331
Good to see you.
I thought you were with your family.

223
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:29,371
I was, then I realized you wouldn't make it
through the big night without me.

224
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:31,249
- Wow, I'm really touched.
- Heh.

225
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,801
I'm trying not to say this,
but if I screw up...

226
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:37,931
- You won't.
- I don't know. I'm not off to a great start.

227
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,491
The generator truck is late.

228
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:42,883
I mugged for the camera during
a radio interview. Can you believe it?

229
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,963
You'll make it happen.

230
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,327
And you'll make it on time
for your meeting.

231
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:50,286
- We're not talking about my meeting.
- And why not?

232
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:52,761
I should've never told you about that.

233
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,729
Look. Come here, lookit.

234
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,801
They're testing the confetti for tonight.

235
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,608
Don't just dump them!

236
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,767
Float them in the wind.
It should be magical.

237
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:11,846
I'm so glad you're here.

238
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,366
Laura, I know you're upset. All right?

239
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:23,291
- Mr. Jensen, I play piano.
- I just play.

240
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:25,005
Thank you, thank you.

241
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:29,680
- Laura, it's been a year already.
- I have nothing to say to you, Daniel.

242
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:32,491
- "Daniel."
- She knows Mr. Jensen.

243
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,451
Hello, secrets.

244
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,841
Look at me. Just look at me.

245
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,163
- That was quite a slap.
- I've been plotting that slap all year.

246
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,966
How I would walk up to you
when you least expect it...

247
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:49,124
...and slap you across the face
for leaving me like that.

248
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,606
And you know what?

249
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:55,131
It wasn't nearly as satisfying
as I thought it would be.

250
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,723
- Aah!
- Ooh.

251
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:01,850
- That was closer.
- We're just fooling around.

252
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,202
- I like fooling around too.
- Come back.

253
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,528
I tried to call you.
You never called me back.

254
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:09,490
I left you tickets, you never showed up.
Talk to me, damn it.

255
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:12,007
- Just talk to me.
- Just talk to him.

256
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,845
Because it's New Year's Eve,
you want another shot at it?

257
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:18,649
You walked out on me, Daniel.
I think that says it all.

258
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:22,088
I didn't even get to make you
one dinner in that apartment.

259
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:25,084
You walked out before I unpacked
the first bag of groceries.

260
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:31,522
Celebrities. They're just like us.

261
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:37,890
Mr. Cox? Is there a reason
you asked me to work today?

262
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:40,802
- It's your job.
- Of course.

263
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:43,042
It's just that it's New Year's Eve...

264
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:47,524
...and I thought maybe you wanted
to give me my end-of-year bonus.

265
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,408
- Seeing that it's the end of the year.
- Oh.

266
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:53,286
Right. Almost slipped my mind. Mm.

267
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:57,445
- Glad to remind you, sir.
- Well, unfortunately...

268
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,887
...it has been a tough year
for Ahern Records.

269
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,491
I don't have to tell you.

270
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:04,963
Music piracy, blah, blah, blah.

271
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:10,284
Have I got your name right?

272
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:16,291
Yes, it's just that I wanted to use
my bonus to book a trip.

273
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:18,966
Well, that might get you to Staten Island.

274
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:20,246
Maybe next year.

275
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,210
It's just that I already booked
my two weeks' vacation time.

276
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:25,169
Two weeks? Did I sign off?

277
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:29,611
You don't need to, sir.
It goes through Human Resources.

278
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:33,207
No, it goes through me. And I can't do
without you for two weeks.

279
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,561
You can have one week.

280
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,163
Well, then...

281
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,321
...I'll take two weeks...

282
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,884
...and my stapler.

283
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:46,800
I quit.

284
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:49,804
You can't quit, it's Grammy season!

285
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:52,050
I...

286
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:53,720
I almost died today, sir.

287
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:56,207
No, no. You look fine.

288
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:58,249
Can you get me a coffee?

289
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,731
Don't forget the sugar!

290
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:07,611
Come on, three stars! I need three stars!

291
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:15,608
Jonathan Cox's office. Please hold.

292
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,927
- Look out!
- Oh, God. No, don't.

293
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:24,122
I have hated him for leaving me like that.

294
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:26,521
- No, don't do the egg.
- Then he just shows up...

295
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:30,685
...on the biggest night of my career!
What kind of karma is that? Huh?

296
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:32,683
What, that you made love with Jensen...

297
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,486
...or that you're catering
the biggest party in the city?

298
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,404
Because all I'm hearing is good.

299
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,730
- Can I do one?
- Yeah.

300
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,326
- The expensive eggs?
- They feel good.

301
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:44,687
Oh.

302
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,366
Oh, that was so sissy.

303
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:50,207
I'm delicate girl.

304
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,442
<i>Dr. Trokin to Radiation Therapy.</i>

305
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,882
<i>Dr. Trokin to Radiation Therapy.</i>

306
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:59,523
- Hey, doc.
- Yes, Mr. Harris.

307
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,882
I haven't asked you for anything, have I?

308
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:04,888
No. No, you haven't.

309
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,603
No chemo...

310
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:12,004
...no radiation, nothing that could
give you an extra couple of months.

311
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:14,651
So then you owe me one.

312
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:16,968
Sure, Mr. Harris. What do you need?

313
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:20,405
Did I tell you why I picked this hospital?

314
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:22,961
Because of the quality of the doctors?

315
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:27,600
The roof has a great view of the New
Year's Eve ball drop in Times Square.

316
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:31,730
I heard you say
I was living on borrowed time.

317
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,450
I don't recall telling you that.

318
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,523
I heard you tell the nurses.

319
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:37,364
I'm dying, I'm not deaf.

320
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,327
Well, you've certainly surprised us,
Mr. Harris.

321
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:46,571
But be honest, there really isn't anyone
we can notify? No one at all?

322
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:51,089
The only people who ever cared about me,
I pissed off long ago. There's no one.

323
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,491
Doc, come on.

324
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:56,604
Call it a dying man's last wish.

325
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,722
Please, come on. I've been hanging on this
long just so I can see the ball drop...

326
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,130
...one more time.

327
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:08,371
- You know, it's cold out there.
- I'll live.

328
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:13,924
- You can see it much better on TV.
- I don't wanna see it on TV, doc, please.

329
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:19,120
As much as I'd like to help you, it's against
hospital policy to allow anyone on the roof.

330
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:21,721
Just forget it. Forget I asked.

331
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:25,402
- Okay. If there's anything else you need...
- No, nothing.

332
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:28,325
- ...just have the nurses page me, okay?
- Yeah.

333
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,130
Okay.

334
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,961
See if you can get him to eat something.

335
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,645
Did he change his mind?

336
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:40,646
Nope. No treatment,
just palliative meds at this point.

337
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:43,810
- I guess it's time for hospice.
- No time.

338
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,767
Well, is he gonna make it
until tomorrow?

339
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,001
It's doubtful.

340
00:20:55,640 --> 00:21:00,123
Another thing that chaps my ass about the
holiday season is all the fake niceness.

341
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:03,449
Like, today I received 50 text messages...

342
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,887
...with a generic "Happy New Year"...

343
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:08,566
...from people who hit "send"
to their address book.

344
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:12,850
Most of them I haven't heard from
since last year. Call me back.

345
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:17,208
Oh, hey, hold the elevator.

346
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:19,687
- I'm going down.
- Oh, wait, wait.

347
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,882
- Honestly...
- Me too.

348
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:26,204
Yeah, I tore down the decorations.

349
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:31,205
According to the lease agreement, you're
not supposed to decorate the hallways.

350
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:34,202
Not my decorations.

351
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:56,044
- Yep.
- No, no, no. This can't be happening.

352
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:58,248
I have somewhere that I need to be.

353
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:02,729
Hello? Hello? Hello?

354
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:05,048
- Wait, this thing is dead!
- It doesn't work.

355
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,089
Well, call the super.

356
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,571
He doesn't work either.

357
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:10,371
- No reception.
- Oh, no.

358
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:12,921
Oh, you're the new girl from 5B.

359
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,687
Why aren't you more panicked
right now?

360
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:19,889
Oh, I don't know. I don't really
have anywhere to be.

361
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:25,011
Hello? Hello, this is 5B! This is 5B!

362
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:27,003
I'm stuck in this elevator!

363
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,969
I'm gonna be late for work.

364
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,764
False alarm, dear ones.

365
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:37,163
- But everything's okay, right?
- Oh, everything looks very good.

366
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,649
Hmm...

367
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:47,250
We close both eyes so that
we may see through the other.

368
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:48,961
<i>Close them.</i>

369
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,167
No.

370
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:56,683
Hmm.
Labor could be any day now.

371
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:59,361
Any day?

372
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:03,042
Don't worry, I know you wanna have
a very natural childbirth...

373
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:06,727
...no epidural, no pitocin, we're gonna
use the hypnobirthing techniques.

374
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:10,885
We were actually just kind of wondering
if we could schedule a C-section.

375
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:14,123
Just, you know, kind of get this show
on the road, am I right?

376
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:16,328
- Yeah.
- Uh, we were thinking, um...

377
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,602
...maybe tonight-ish.

378
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:21,127
Midnight-ish. Uh...

379
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,566
- Right? Griff, right?
- Yeah.

380
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:25,451
We were both thinking that
maybe tonight could work better.

381
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:28,888
- If we could do tonight that would be great.
- Tonight?

382
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,571
Hmm.

383
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:36,445
You want me to come in on New Year's Eve
at midnight and perform a C-section?

384
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:38,721
Is it New Year's?

385
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:41,486
- Oh, boy. Weird.
- It is. Yeah.

386
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:43,768
- I completely just forgot.
- I did too.

387
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:45,888
- I think with all this.
- Pregnancy brain.

388
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:49,487
We were never really New Year's people.
We're more Memorial Day people.

389
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:51,369
Let me be clear.

390
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:56,369
I will not schedule a C-section
just so you can win some money.

391
00:23:56,520 --> 00:24:00,002
The couple who was in here before
offered to split the winnings with me.

392
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:02,083
And of course I said no.

393
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:05,688
Frankly, I'm surprised that you would
even suggest this, Tess.

394
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,841
What if we went 60-40?

395
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:13,081
- Seventy-thirty.
- Yeah.

396
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:16,245
You are dangerously close
to a rectal exam.

397
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:18,890
Oh, that's not good.

398
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:21,691
Mom, I wanna go to Times Square
to watch the ball drop.

399
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:26,562
Well, I plan to avoid this entire section
of the city tonight.

400
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:29,166
Well, I don't want you to stay.
I want you to go home.

401
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:32,521
- Ouch.
- There's this guy in my history class.

402
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,887
His name is Seth, and I've been hoping...

403
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:38,886
I have this, like, sick dream that, you
know, we'll get to hang out at midnight.

404
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:41,048
And then, of course,
I'll come right home.

405
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,166
Honey, I'm sorry.

406
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:48,406
I'm just... I'm not comfortable allowing you
to stay in Times Square at night alone.

407
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,682
- Period.
- End of discussion, got it.

408
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:53,882
Sorry. Come on.

409
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,961
- You know, I'm 15!
- I know, Hailey.

410
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,531
This is not a training bra!

411
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:01,200
And this is not <i>Girls Gone Wild!</i>

412
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:02,407
MY gosh.

413
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:04,568
Mom, you know,
I'm an honors student, okay?

414
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:08,725
I don't drink or do drugs, and I'm trying
really hard to be the perfect daughter.

415
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:11,963
- But it's like you don't trust me.
- No, it's not you I don't trust.

416
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:14,964
Then who do you not trust, Mom?
You don't trust the world?

417
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,646
Or is it just New York
because it's a big scary city?

418
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:19,245
Have you ever been to Newark?

419
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:24,648
Look, Mom, the world doesn't scare me,
okay? It's just getting good.

420
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:26,723
I wanna start living in it.

421
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,491
You used to.

422
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:34,085
<i>Brady Finley in Times Square.</i>

423
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:38,165
<i>It's before noon and they're already
predicting record-breaking crowds.</i>

424
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:41,802
I'm with Miss Morgan.
We're bringing the media to the roof.

425
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:45,410
Hey. You okay?

426
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:48,727
- Fine.
- You're not afraid of heights, are you?

427
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:50,970
- A little.
- Let me be accurate.

428
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,771
You're afraid of heights
and you run the ball drop?

429
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:57,291
Well, I think it's what makes Claire
the best for this job.

430
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:01,128
- Let's do that thing we worked out.
- Yeah, let's do that.

431
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:02,850
- Officer Nolan.
- Yes, sir.

432
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,890
Be careful here.
This is precious cargo, all right?

433
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:07,885
Make a hole, people.

434
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:13,208
- Oh.
- Oh, are we all getting picked up?

435
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:14,964
- Sure.
- No, no, no.

436
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:17,043
No, no, no.

437
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,564
Okay.

438
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:22,087
I'm okay. Ha-ha.

439
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,083
Okay. Where were we?

440
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,605
Uh... Oh, the ball.

441
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,531
Since 1907 there's been
a Times Square ball drop.

442
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:31,921
The first ball was made
of wood and iron...

443
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:35,482
...and had only 100 25-watt light bulbs.

444
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:39,605
Okay. Let's light this baby up.

445
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:41,361
Ready?

446
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:43,366
- Oh.
- Hey!

447
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,844
- It worked!
- Beautiful.

448
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:50,765
Okay, so this evening we are gonna raise
this ball to the very top of the pole...

449
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:54,009
...where it will stay until 11:59.

450
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:56,527
And then the countdown begins.

451
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:00,884
Can you fix it?
- No. And don't you want to know why?

452
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:04,806
Because the complicated machine
behind me isn't called a fix truck.

453
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,041
It's called a tow truck.

454
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:09,966
That means I put the big hook under the
broken car and take it anywhere you want.

455
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:11,929
- Which is where?
- New York City.

456
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:13,491
No again.

457
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:16,883
Not today and not me. I've got big plans
with my lady friend tonight.

458
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,644
Sign there.

459
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:21,406
Can you at least tow it
to a mechanic nearby, please?

460
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:24,006
Nearest mechanic is 10 minutes away.

461
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:26,487
- Whatever, that's perfect.
- Let me finish.

462
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:30,167
He's 10 minutes away, but he's closed
today. Everyone's closed today.

463
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:32,800
I guess you know since you're
dressed like Penn & Teller.

464
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:35,367
As far as the car goes, you're SOL...

465
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:38,364
...which means "something out of luck,"
but I don't curse.

466
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:42,570
I can't be SOL. I've got a big speech
at the company party tonight, okay?

467
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:43,841
This is very important.

468
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,207
- I've got something important too.
- Like what?

469
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:49,844
Me and my girl are gonna crush
a 12-pack and watch porn.

470
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,126
- Ms. Withers?
- Oh.

471
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:02,602
Did you call in a delivery of something?

472
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:04,922
- Ingrid.
- Ingrid.

473
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:07,487
And actually...

474
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:09,925
...I'm your next job.

475
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:11,566
I bought you for the day.

476
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:13,165
Bought me for the day, huh?

477
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:17,211
Oh, Ms. Withers. I think I should be
offended, but I'm just too intrigued.

478
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:18,805
My New Year's resolutions.

479
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,411
Mm-hm.

480
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,248
I just took care of the first one.

481
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:26,489
You quit your job?

482
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:31,841
- All right.
- If you make these come true by midnight...

483
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,126
...you get these.

484
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:40,647
For me?

485
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,530
Holy sh...

486
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:46,401
Whoa. Whoa, okay. Put these down.
Don't flash those around.

487
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:48,528
Everybody can see them. Seriously.

488
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:52,328
You called the right guy.
I'm in. Let me see number two.

489
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:55,450
What is it? Whew.

490
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:59,642
"Go to Bali. Breakfast at Tiffany's."

491
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,126
You wanna save a life.

492
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:04,127
Are you kidding me?

493
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:07,090
Impossible. I don't understand
what you're talking about.

494
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:09,925
I don't understand what
you want me to do here.

495
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:12,321
Use your imagination.

496
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:19,847
We're gonna need a bigger boat.

497
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:25,200
You know, you don't have to sit like that.

498
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:28,330
You can put your legs around me,
or you can hold onto me.

499
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,289
No, I'm okay.

500
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:31,807
All right.

501
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:36,201
<i>Señor</i> Jensen, I'm here.

502
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:40,521
And I brought you some enchiladas.
They're very spicy.

503
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:41,886
Thank you.

504
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:44,520
Listen, Ava, I was hoping maybe
you could help me out.

505
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:46,842
What is it? Is it writer's block?

506
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,844
Because if it is, I've been jotting
down these lyrics.

507
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,651
They're in Spanish now,
but I can translate them.

508
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:56,168
Come, come. Come here.
No, not like that. Really. Just...

509
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:59,726
Help me convince Laura
that I made a mistake.

510
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:02,531
- When?
- It was last New Year's Eve.

511
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:04,284
What did you do to her?

512
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:06,249
Nothing. I asked her to marry me.

513
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:07,601
That's beautiful.

514
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:10,047
But then I got cold feet.
I wasn't ready for it.

515
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:11,810
That's horrible.

516
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:14,042
You were the one who proposed.

517
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:17,124
In my country when a man
gets down on one knee...

518
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:20,204
...it's because he wants to get married
or he's been shot.

519
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:23,367
Sometimes it's been because of both.

520
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:28,406
No, no. It's just that it all came at me
too fast and I wasn't ready for it.

521
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:31,723
I had to go back on the road,
and I just didn't wanna deal with it.

522
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:35,646
You should have talked to her.
That's what women like. We like to talk.

523
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:39,088
I tried. I just can't get a word in
edgewise between slaps.

524
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:42,083
Do you want to know what I think?

525
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,446
Well, I sure would.

526
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:48,324
Ay. Hi, Laura.

527
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:52,930
This is not what it looks like. No.

528
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:54,121
- No?
- No.

529
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:58,888
It's not my ex-boyfriend telling our
whole sad saga to my new sous-chef?

530
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:01,003
Yeah, pretty much that's what it is.

531
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:03,083
Uh-huh.

532
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,285
- Be strong.
- Mm.

533
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,841
- Hold your ground.
- Yes.

534
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,449
But don't look into his eyes because
they're beautiful. He has, like, a blue...

535
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:14,725
Bye.

536
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,561
Truce?

537
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:21,727
Truce.

538
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,290
Breakfast at Tiffany's.

539
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,041
Done.

540
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,242
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

541
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:37,326
<i>Take a New York taxi ride with no traffic.</i>

542
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:38,811
<i>Done.</i>

543
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:41,205
Did you hear the new record?

544
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:42,964
No.

545
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,891
Yeah.

546
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:49,651
What'd you think?

547
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:53,208
Ugh. You know, I wanted to hate it.
I really did. But I loved it.

548
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:55,131
I thought it was great.

549
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,762
Except for the picture you chose
for the cover.

550
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:02,084
It was a little too much bronzer.

551
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:04,766
Well, as always, I could've used your help.

552
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:10,408
I'm a little overwhelmed and frazzled
by this job tonight...

553
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:12,449
...so I apologize for slapping you.

554
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:13,726
The second time.

555
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:19,402
I'm sorry I ran, Laura.

556
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:22,329
Oh, Daniel.

557
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:24,523
You sprinted.

558
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,247
I mean...

559
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:28,681
Laura, can I see you?

560
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:31,121
I gotta get back to work,
focus on tonight.

561
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:32,725
What about tomorrow?

562
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:35,804
We're going back on tour
and I'd love it if you'd come with me.

563
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:38,727
We could fix this.

564
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:41,690
Yeah, sure. I'll go pack a bag.
Meet you at the bus?

565
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:44,166
Come on.

566
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:48,006
I can't go back on tour with you.
I did your life. I have a life too.

567
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:50,567
You really don't get it, do you?

568
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,730
What's there to get?

569
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:55,724
I'm ready to commit.

570
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:58,489
I'm ready.

571
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:01,041
Yeah. Yeah, me too.

572
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,567
I'm ready to commit to what I really love:

573
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:05,210
My work.

574
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:08,280
I can't do this again with you, Daniel.

575
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:19,003
Nope. Still no reception.

576
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:21,250
So how can you have nowhere to be?

577
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:25,644
Isn't it obvious? New Year's is the worst
night to go out. It's total amateur night.

578
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:29,930
People who don't drink or go nuts all year
suddenly going all Kanye on you.

579
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:31,445
It's like a war zone.

580
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:34,046
Because they have something
to be excited about.

581
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:36,402
I have something to be excited about.

582
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:38,927
Oh, oh, oh.

583
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:41,328
Who were you gonna kiss at midnight?

584
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:45,807
Oh. And then it's one big giant letdown.

585
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,968
See, that's the problem with New Year's.

586
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:52,648
Everybody builds up such high expectation that
they're inevitably, utterly disappointed.

587
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:55,889
Hey, can you get through
that ceiling hatch?

588
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,450
I am not Spider-Man.

589
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:00,930
Clearly. Clearly.

590
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:04,050
If I just climb right through there,
get out that window.

591
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:06,646
And we're gonna be out of here.
I am gonna do it.

592
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:09,561
Lift me up. Lift me up.
I don't have all day.

593
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:11,410
There you go.
- Oh.

594
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:12,766
It's a lock.

595
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:16,730
Oh, I have a nail file.
I'll file it with my nail file.

596
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:18,370
I'll file through it.

597
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,801
Ugh. You're a groupie?

598
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,160
Put me down.

599
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:31,523
I got hats and horns and <i>hazarai.</i>
I got streamers...

600
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:33,842
- Hey, Marvin. Hi. Happy New Year.
- Hey, Kim.

601
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,606
- Mom, can I go tell my friends?
- Sure, yeah.

602
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:37,847
Go ahead.

603
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,002
So Hailey and I
are having a party tonight.

604
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:41,525
Hey, wait up.

605
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:44,451
- Hey. Um...
- Hey.

606
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:46,005
I can't come.

607
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:49,529
What? Hailey, what do you mean?
Half the history class is going.

608
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:52,081
- I know. It's just my mom won't let me.
- You serious?

609
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:54,561
I know. I sound like I'm 12, I know.

610
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:57,451
All right, where's your mom? Maybe I...

611
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:59,648
- Hi. Hi, Mrs. Doyle.
- Hi.

612
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:01,165
You look lovely today.

613
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:04,369
You seem like a nice boy.
I'm just not comfortable with Hailey...

614
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:07,763
...spending tonight in Times Square
unsupervised.

615
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:10,491
Right. With all due respect...

616
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:13,530
supervision is for kids, you know?
We're young adults.

617
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,047
Who are you calling?

618
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,168
- You're Rose Anderson's son, right?
- Yeah.

619
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:22,244
Yeah, we serve together on your
school's academic booster club.

620
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:27,322
Oh. You know, I think she left her cell
phone at home. She gonna go out tonight.

621
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:29,210
- Oh.
- Yeah.

622
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:30,847
Okay.

623
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,161
Happy New Year.

624
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:33,845
Yeah. Happy New Year.

625
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:36,089
You wanna say goodbye?

626
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,085
So?

627
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:40,248
Hailey, I tried. But she fights dirty.

628
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:43,891
Yeah, I know. Welcome to my life.

629
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:45,770
- Bye.
- Bye.

630
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:53,007
Ladies, let's go. Yo.
Ladies, let's roll out!

631
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:54,400
- Yeah!
- Whoo!

632
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:17,045
What is this neighborhood? Is it safe?

633
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:18,804
Give it a chance.

634
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:22,362
"Give Paul a chance."

635
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:25,371
I don't like it here.

636
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:28,931
Maybe this is a really bad idea.
I'll just give you the tickets.

637
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:31,361
<i>Give Paul a chance.</i>

638
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:34,046
<i>Just give me a chance and I'll show you.</i>

639
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:35,765
What I can do.

640
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,241
Ingrid Withers...

641
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:41,691
...go to Bali.

642
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:00,204
It's Bali.

643
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:02,006
It's Brooklyn.

644
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:03,761
It's a spa.

645
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,004
Thank you.

646
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:30,041
I'm sorry. We really can't take you
this early yet.

647
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:33,966
Dr. Morriset says that you're not ready.
You'll have to come back in a few hours.

648
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:36,930
We may not have been ready,
but now she's eating anchovies...

649
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:39,082
...which the Internet claims induce labor.

650
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:40,765
If only you can keep it down.

651
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:43,924
Yeah, but it really doesn't go that fast.

652
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:50,244
- No. I can't do it. I can't do it.
- Excuse me.

653
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:52,170
I'm sorry.

654
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:53,924
I tried. I can't do it any more.

655
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:55,724
You need a breath mint.

656
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:58,368
Hey, Risa. So we are ready
to check in now.

657
00:37:58,520 --> 00:37:59,760
They're checking in?

658
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:06,887
Hey. Good to see you again.

659
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:10,647
You must be joking, because inside
I'm laughing really, really hard.

660
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:15,166
You really think you can come into this
at the last minute and steal our money?

661
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,000
I'm sorry, are you being serious?

662
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:20,682
You are even a bigger numbnuts
than you look.

663
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,842
This little fish won't save you.

664
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:26,643
You probably don't even know
that yams can kick-start labor.

665
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,245
Well, yeah, actually, we do.

666
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:31,370
In fact, at this moment, my wife is
full of yams, but thank you.

667
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:32,931
Crammed with yams.

668
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:35,328
Snap. It doesn't.

669
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:37,130
It stops pre-term labor.

670
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:40,360
- Did he just snap me in a maternity ward?
- Yes.

671
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,050
You're a really hostile guy.

672
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:44,089
Where do you work, the DMV?

673
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:45,844
No, I run a charm school.

674
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:48,720
Oh, yeah? Where's your charm school,
Guantanamo?

675
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:51,882
It's on 48th and Madison,
you should come by.

676
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:54,361
Because you could really
use some charm.

677
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:57,602
- He actually works at a charm school.
- No way.

678
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:01,248
Ah. Prince of Charming.

679
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:07,883
Hello, vision in pink.

680
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:09,520
Can we check in now?

681
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:12,081
Well, actually,
the ultrasound says it's a no.

682
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:15,170
She's not ready either,
so you'll all have to come back later.

683
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:16,810
I'm sorry, James.

684
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,928
It's not your fault.

685
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:23,287
- I'm sorry too.
- Right.

686
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:26,603
- Also, it's on now, Prince Charming. Yeah.
- You bet.

687
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:30,004
What are you doing, honey?

688
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:33,131
Oh, it's on.

689
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:35,527
- I'm sorry?
- Oh, no.

690
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:36,767
What's on?

691
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:38,964
Oh, yeah, this?

692
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:42,007
- It's on.
- Come on. Let's go, honey.

693
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:45,846
Nobody wins when pregnant women fight.
Come on. Come on.

694
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:49,485
Something's on. Heh-heh.

695
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:55,964
I know you gave up your
own plans tonight just to be with me.

696
00:39:56,160 --> 00:40:00,006
I can't become your everything, Mom.
Please don't become a Piper's mom.

697
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:03,687
A what? "A Piper's mom"?

698
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:06,721
What, you mean like Joanna?

699
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:09,640
Yes, Piper's mom.
She hides in the bushes every day...

700
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:12,684
...just to make sure that Piper
goes to school. It's nuts.

701
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:15,650
- Come on. I'm not that bad.
- Mom, you've stopped trying.

702
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:19,168
You're being clingy and mean,
because you don't have a man in your life.

703
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:21,004
You really gotta find somebody.

704
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:23,845
Look, Mom, you're a hot woman.

705
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:27,847
If you'd just, you know,
lose the clogs, maybe?

706
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:34,762
I'm sorry, but I am trying.
And I would like you to try.

707
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:36,843
Just have our New Year's party.

708
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:40,129
- And toot-toot, Happy New Year!
- Okay. Mom! Mom! No more.

709
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:42,207
I'm over it.

710
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:45,606
I'm over it and I'm over you.

711
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:53,726
Why are we at the church? You were
supposed to take me to the rental car shop!

712
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:55,882
Hey, James Bond,
I need one more signature.

713
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:57,883
For what?! What am I even signing for?

714
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:00,566
So you can get your car back.
Right there. Initials.

715
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:02,722
Keep the pen, it's got my name on it.

716
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:05,804
Didn't I tell you that
all the rental places close at 3?

717
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:09,169
I've got you covered.
There's your ride right there. Hey, Edwin.

718
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:11,010
Hey, Harley. Hey, Sam.

719
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:12,889
Hey, he's the pastor.

720
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:14,565
Yeah, that's right. It's the earmuffs.

721
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:18,168
- So my cousin here tells me you need a lift.
- Cousin?

722
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:22,689
I'm taking my wife and kids to see the Radio
City Rockettes. We do it every New Year's.

723
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:24,490
Ever seen the Rockettes? Tch-tch.

724
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:27,246
Happy to give you a lift.
You want to pitch in for gas?

725
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:30,722
- Hell, yeah. I'll pay for all the gas.
- Don't say "hell," he's a pastor.

726
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:32,331
Show him the book.

727
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:34,289
Give me my pen back.

728
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:36,847
I'll never understand people with hair.

729
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:38,685
Thank you, Harley.

730
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:42,324
There she is.

731
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:44,964
How much gas are we talking about?

732
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:47,043
What's your credit-card limit?

733
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:50,285
ICU, how can I help you?

734
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:52,563
Hi, Mr. Harris.

735
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:55,130
How you doing today?

736
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:57,367
Right.

737
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:02,242
You've been here for weeks.
First no radiation, now no chemo. Why?

738
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:06,047
What's the difference, you know?
Why delay the inevitable? I don't know.

739
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:11,881
When I was a photographer in Vietnam,
I'd see death all the time.

740
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:14,648
Nothing prepared me for this.

741
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:18,450
I promise I'm gonna make you
as comfortable as I can, okay?

742
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:21,367
Just get me to midnight and we're even.

743
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:22,601
Okay.

744
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:26,244
I'll be back.

745
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:36,405
Honey? I've been thinking.

746
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:38,324
Hailey?

747
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:49,721
I fought so hard for custody.

748
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,890
Hey, I got hats here!
What do you need? Yo! Scarves, hats!

749
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:55,168
Happy New Year! Here, pick a hat.
Go ahead.

750
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:57,288
Keep walking, then. Go ahead.

751
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:02,248
Marvin!
- Kim!

752
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:03,970
- Hailey!
- Up.

753
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:05,645
Oh, thanks.

754
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:09,328
Hey, yo. Happy New Year!

755
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:10,851
Poppers, streamers, horns!

756
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:32,530
Hailey!

757
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:41,811
Calling you.

758
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:49,771
<i>Hey, it's Hailey.</i>

759
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:52,048
<i>Leave me a message
and I'll try and get back to you.</i>

760
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:06,290
I think she decided.

761
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:08,681
- You got a hat.
- You got a dog.

762
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:10,285
Oh, it's a big responsibility.

763
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:13,523
Yeah, but you gotta give it a chance.
Give it a chance, right?

764
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:16,251
We'll give him his shots.
You can pick him up Monday.

765
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:18,084
Or you can wait and think about it.

766
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:21,411
No.

767
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:23,689
- I'm done waiting.
- Yeah!

768
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:27,322
We're gonna make each other
very happy. Aren't we?

769
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:29,084
What are we gonna name him?

770
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:32,490
- Um...
- Something manly like Kong.

771
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:36,765
How about Mr. Snugglepuss?

772
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:39,048
"Snugglepuss"?
You can decide on a name later.

773
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:42,170
Anyways, look what you just did.

774
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:45,250
Saved a life. Check.

775
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:48,164
Take a trip around the world.

776
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:51,051
It's a bit of a cheat. But check.

777
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:08,288
It's 6:00 here in Times Square.

778
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:13,129
And now to host tonight's festivities,
Mr. New Year's Eve himself:

779
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:14,520
Ryan Seacrest!

780
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:23,286
Thank you very much.

781
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:25,005
Hello, New York City!

782
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:26,806
I'm Ryan Seacrest.

783
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:30,885
Are you ready to see the Times Square
ball being raised?

784
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:34,243
We've been joined by several
members of the Times Square Alliance...

785
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:36,289
...as they get ready for the ball drop.

786
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:39,410
I know you're nervous,
but you have to look up, Jeffrey.

787
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:41,289
Here we go!

788
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:03,005
Uh-oh.

789
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:08,921
That's not supposed to happen.

790
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:14,680
Sorry, friends,
we have a bit of a hiccup here.

791
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:17,810
We'll just sort that out, no problem.

792
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,287
Stay with us, we'll be right back, okay?

793
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:23,561
We will have it up and running
momentarily, right?

794
00:46:23,720 --> 00:46:25,085
Yeah. It's... There's...

795
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:26,480
- Please? Please.
- Yes.

796
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:30,167
I'm starting to feel a little bit of pressure.
Pressure's not great to feel.

797
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:33,847
And it messes with my hair.
And I need my hair to be up. Like the ball.

798
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:41,731
Go, guys, go. We gotta fix this
by midnight. Go, go, go.

799
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:44,846
Whew. This would never have happened
to Dick Clark.

800
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:51,570
- Can't you show me one special trick?
- I'm not a magician.

801
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:54,566
- Okay?
- Are you in the Secret Service, mister?

802
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:55,801
Duncan.

803
00:46:55,960 --> 00:46:58,122
So, what's the speech about, Sam?

804
00:46:58,280 --> 00:47:00,851
Like I said, I haven't even written it yet.

805
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:04,089
I guess I'm still looking for
the inspiration.

806
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:08,082
What inspires you, Sam?

807
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:11,760
- Pizza.
- Excellent.

808
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:13,606
Sweet.

809
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:15,241
Okay, thanks.

810
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:19,809
<i>Welcome to the Queens Museum...</i>

811
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:23,442
<i>...featuring the New York City miniatures
depicting all five boroughs.</i>

812
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:29,449
Walk all five boroughs in one day.

813
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:32,850
Crossing that off the list.

814
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:40,487
Yo, Randy, I know you said you didn't
wanna come out tonight, but listen.

815
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:44,281
I made a deal with this lady
for four tickets to Ahern's VIP party.

816
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:47,086
I don't know what her deal is, man.
She's just...

817
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:49,925
...like, a couple sandwiches
short of a picnic. You know?

818
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:53,801
Like a little bit pathetic.
In, like, a cute way.

819
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:56,042
So, dude, please, please
call me back, bro.

820
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:59,682
I need you. I need my wingman
at this party. Hit me back, bro.

821
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:02,801
Okay. All right, next up...

822
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:05,528
...is to be amazed.

823
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:07,730
Which is very vague.

824
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:11,680
I will be amazed if I can come up
with something. But I will.

825
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:14,083
I don't wanna do this any more.

826
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:16,251
What are you talking about?

827
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:19,690
I'm pathetic...

828
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:21,645
...dude.

829
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:25,890
Hey.

830
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:30,887
Wait, where are you going?

831
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:32,769
Staten Island.

832
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:39,490
- Miss Morgan, we're not sure what's wrong.
- How long will it take to be sure?

833
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:43,049
I don't know. A couple minutes,
a couple hours, maybe more.

834
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:46,249
We don't have a couple of hours.
We only have midnight.

835
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:48,886
I have one job tonight. To make sure...

836
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:53,045
...even if I have to do it with my own two
hands, that ball descends at midnight.

837
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:54,651
You can't move midnight.

838
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:59,447
Why are you looking at your shoes?
You're not telling me something.

839
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:01,523
What are you not telling me?

840
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:07,045
We need Kominsky.

841
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:09,369
The Kominsky?

842
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:14,611
Tess?

843
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:17,447
Tess? You in the bathroom?

844
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:21,961
What are you doing?

845
00:49:22,120 --> 00:49:24,009
Yoga. It's supposed to help.

846
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:27,448
I'm no expert, but seems like that would
send the baby in the wrong direction.

847
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:30,805
Let me help you.

848
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:32,769
Oh...

849
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:34,046
- Did you get it?
- Yeah.

850
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:36,242
And I got a discount
with my vet school ID.

851
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:38,607
You'll make such a good
veterinarian someday.

852
00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:41,525
Thanks. And if you were a horse,
I'd know what to do.

853
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:45,366
Of course, if you were a horse,
we'd never get invited to dinner parties...

854
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:47,761
- ...and I'd be married to a horse.
- Ha-ha-ha.

855
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:49,689
This smells awful.

856
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:52,367
- Drink it.
- Mm-mm.

857
00:49:52,520 --> 00:49:53,681
What? It's castor oil.

858
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:55,331
Mary Poppins swore by this.

859
00:49:55,480 --> 00:49:58,051
Mary Poppins also danced
with cartoon penguins.

860
00:49:58,200 --> 00:49:59,531
You first.

861
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:01,250
You're a coward.

862
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:06,686
- Mm. Mm.
- Hmm. I'm sensing a thumbs down.

863
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:08,729
Ugh. Mary Poppins sucks.

864
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:11,526
Well, you forgot about
the spoonful of sugar. Ooh.

865
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:13,648
- What was that?
- What was what?

866
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:15,529
Oh, my gosh. My water broke.

867
00:50:16,360 --> 00:50:17,850
- All of it?
- Oh.

868
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:19,321
Well, what do you think?

869
00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:21,642
Well, that's too early.
Can you turn it off?

870
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:23,802
- And how do you suggest I do that?
- Yoga?

871
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:27,851
Get upside down. You can do a downward
dog or an upward dog. Do one of the dogs.

872
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:30,361
- Okay, we need to pack!
- We have packed.

873
00:50:30,520 --> 00:50:32,090
- Okay, calm.
- Taxi!

874
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:36,370
- I don't think we're gonna get one up here.
- Right, we gotta go where the cars live.

875
00:50:36,520 --> 00:50:38,727
- Pants, I need pants.
- Okay.

876
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:42,086
These are your pants.

877
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:44,802
Give me the cute pink ones.

878
00:50:45,120 --> 00:50:46,690
Don't throw them at me.

879
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:50,410
Okay, so I'll meet you there?

880
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:53,766
You should come with me.

881
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:56,082
- We should both go.
- Oh...

882
00:50:56,280 --> 00:50:58,362
Lady with a baby coming through.

883
00:50:58,520 --> 00:51:01,364
Taxi! Pregnant! Taxi!

884
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:05,690
Okay. Want me to help?

885
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:09,811
Honey, I spent my whole life
living in New York City.

886
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,002
I think I know how to get a taxicab.

887
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:14,640
- Yeah.
- No! No!

888
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:18,044
Hah. Good job, homeboy.

889
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:20,369
All right. Plan B. Hold this.

890
00:51:20,520 --> 00:51:22,284
- Ch!

891
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:27,723
Be here now.

892
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:29,120
Taxi!

893
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:31,205
You're doing great, honey.

894
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:32,805
- You're doing great.
- Oh!

895
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:37,004
Can't we pedal faster?

896
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:40,649
- Hey, buddy, can you go a little faster?
- This is my faster.

897
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:44,569
Haven't you been here all day?

898
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:48,690
- When do you go home?
- Just before midnight.

899
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:50,001
Ah.

900
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:54,563
You know what, I don't care about
all that hoopla and stuff anyway.

901
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:57,485
So no big plans? A party or...?

902
00:51:57,640 --> 00:51:58,801
Nope.

903
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:01,804
No hot date? Pretty girl like you.

904
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:03,166
Well...

905
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:05,046
...maybe.

906
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:07,841
But right now you're my hot date.

907
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:11,127
- Why?
- Pardon me?

908
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:14,085
Why would you wanna be nice to me?

909
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:17,450
I'm an ass.

910
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:20,730
I spent my entire whole life being an ass.

911
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:24,805
And I don't know how to stop.

912
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:27,523
Well, you know what, Stan?

913
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:32,481
Maybe being an ass is the reason you've
gotten every single thing you ever wanted.

914
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:34,561
Not everything.

915
00:52:38,120 --> 00:52:40,361
I'm sorry I called you a groupie.

916
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:44,087
We're stuck in an elevator together.
You're not gonna talk to me at all?

917
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:47,762
Fine. We can talk.

918
00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:51,766
But as long as we're making
assumptions about each other...

919
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:53,365
...why don't I give it a shot?

920
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:58,524
You grew up in suburban
fill-in-the-blank.

921
00:52:58,680 --> 00:53:00,887
You went to la-di-da liberal-arts school.

922
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:03,481
You didn't have enough drive
to get a real job...

923
00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:05,529
...and then you grew half a beard...

924
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:09,571
...and moved to Manhattan
on your grandmother's inheritance.

925
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:14,009
And now you think that just because you
moved somewhere that makes you cool...

926
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:16,447
...but the truth is,
is that it doesn't. Okay?

927
00:53:16,600 --> 00:53:20,161
Because you're just some wannabe
hipster who judges everything...

928
00:53:20,320 --> 00:53:23,005
...because you're too scared
to take a chance on anything.

929
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:27,802
And, you know, my guess is that
this whole hatred for New Year's...

930
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:30,281
...comes from some
boring-as-hell prom queen...

931
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:35,367
...who broke your heart on New Year's Eve
in high school. So, what, am I close?

932
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:39,209
Suburban Maryland.

933
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:41,129
Tufts University.

934
00:53:41,840 --> 00:53:43,729
And I am a comic-book artist.

935
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:46,120
You draw?

936
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:47,481
I illustrate.

937
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:50,885
And it was in college...

938
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:52,805
...when she broke it.

939
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:56,767
And this beard took me
like a year to grow.

940
00:53:58,280 --> 00:53:59,520
Cold coffee?

941
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:05,725
Last year there were so many speeches,
I had to get outside.

942
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:07,848
So I actually went out
and got a pizza. Heh.

943
00:54:08,320 --> 00:54:09,845
Did anything else happen?

944
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:14,011
Oh, my. Something else did happen,
didn't it?

945
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:17,564
- Yes.
- Is it R-rated?

946
00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:20,011
Dad.

947
00:54:20,680 --> 00:54:22,648
- I met a woman...
- Oh.

948
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:25,884
...and she was extraordinary.

949
00:54:26,040 --> 00:54:28,520
It's gonna have a goosebump ending.

950
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:31,524
Take your time telling it,
because here comes the traffic.

951
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:35,603
Extraordinary build, huh?

952
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:38,289
I have to get to this party.

953
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:44,643
Welcome to the Brooklyn Museum and
the Ahern party. Please pull right up, sir.

954
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:48,366
<i>Put on 'em ball
When they sleep at the Macy's.</i>

955
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:52,167
Penny. Penny. Just quick one picture.
Right over here!

956
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:55,210
<i>Tied over money like Seacrest
Put it on my life, baby.</i>

957
00:54:55,360 --> 00:54:56,850
<i>I can make you feel right, baby.</i>

958
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,684
<i>- Excuse me.
- Excuse me.</i>

959
00:54:58,840 --> 00:55:02,401
<i>But I might drink a little bit
More than I should tonight.</i>

960
00:55:02,560 --> 00:55:05,564
<i>And I might take you home with me
If I could tonight.</i>

961
00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:07,324
You're an actress, right?

962
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:11,685
Yeah. I've played a nurse, a cop,
a teacher.

963
00:55:11,840 --> 00:55:14,241
How about playing a waitress
and getting me a drink?

964
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:15,925
Go ahead. Scoot, scoot.

965
00:55:16,120 --> 00:55:17,326
<i>And now, your hostess...</i>

966
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:19,482
<i>...the president of Ahern Records,
Mrs. Rose Ahern.</i>

967
00:55:19,640 --> 00:55:24,089
Welcome to the Ahern Records
Masked Ball.

968
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:28,290
What better way to end this year,
both good and bad...

969
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:30,204
...than with the very, very best...

970
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:33,842
...and you all know exactly who
I'm talking about.

971
00:55:34,320 --> 00:55:39,360
So I'll simply say that coming up
on this stage very soon...

972
00:55:39,560 --> 00:55:44,248
...one of the hottest names
Jensen!

973
00:55:49,320 --> 00:55:51,402
I went to Juilliard...

974
00:55:51,560 --> 00:55:53,881
...and I am a backup singer.

975
00:55:54,040 --> 00:55:57,408
Not a back-of-the-tour-bus groupie.

976
00:55:58,040 --> 00:56:02,443
- Randy, a.k.a. Mr. Moron.
- Heh.

977
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,890
- How long you been a backup singer?
- Too long.

978
00:56:07,120 --> 00:56:09,691
Oh, I just got hired for tonight...

979
00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:14,442
...but I was hoping that he would ask me
to go on tour with him. But...

980
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:16,290
You could sing something for me.

981
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:18,727
Oh, no. Ha-ha-ha. No.

982
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:23,568
The only time that I do performances for
audiences of one is when I'm in the shower.

983
00:56:23,720 --> 00:56:26,803
- Well, you...
- Don't say anything.

984
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:31,642
<i>Anxiety is now the prevailing mood
here at One Times Square.</i>

985
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:33,689
The ball is still in a state of stuck.

986
00:56:33,840 --> 00:56:37,925
...As officials await the arrival of
electrical whiz Lester Kominsky.

987
00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:43,491
Oh, I'm sorry, I don't speak Spanish.
I'm from Ohio.

988
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:48,642
- Your coffee.
- Thank you.

989
00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:53,005
<i>The eagle has landed.</i>
- Kominsky's here.

990
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:56,844
Make a hole, people. Move.

991
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:06,084
Kominsky.

992
00:57:07,640 --> 00:57:09,165
I'm Claire Morgan.

993
00:57:09,360 --> 00:57:10,771
Oh, no. Kominsky.

994
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:13,082
- Kominsky's here, yes.
- Yes.

995
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:16,045
Oh. Thank you so much for coming.

996
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:17,765
Yes, it's good.

997
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:22,289
- You fire me.
- No, no. No, that was someone else. No.

998
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:24,762
So, what do you think it is?

999
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:26,724
- Short.
- What's short?

1000
00:57:26,920 --> 00:57:28,445
A short in the ball.

1001
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:29,647
You got it.

1002
00:57:29,840 --> 00:57:31,683
- Sounds pretty straightforward.
- Mm-hm.

1003
00:57:31,880 --> 00:57:33,211
Easy to fix.

1004
00:57:33,360 --> 00:57:35,124
- Then you fix.
- No.

1005
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:36,406
Not so easy.

1006
00:57:36,560 --> 00:57:38,927
This ball has 3500 lighting clues.

1007
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:41,447
Cues. He means cues.

1008
00:57:41,640 --> 00:57:44,211
You have to find the light
that went out in over 3000?

1009
00:57:44,360 --> 00:57:45,771
- Mm-hm.
- Wh...?

1010
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:50,209
Have we not progressed past the Christmas
lights that go out if there's one bad one?

1011
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:54,371
My question also and then I get fired,
so that's all.

1012
00:57:54,520 --> 00:57:56,568
Oh, wait. We need you.

1013
00:57:57,920 --> 00:57:59,490
I need you.

1014
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:07,681
Okay. Then I go visit my ball
on the roof. And...

1015
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:09,686
These TV peoples here?

1016
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:11,650
- Yes.
- Oh.

1017
00:58:11,840 --> 00:58:12,887
Here.

1018
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:16,605
Oh, thank you. Thank you.

1019
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:18,971
Good. Thank you.

1020
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:21,691
<i>Please enjoy our New Year's Eve
entertainment...</i>

1021
00:58:21,840 --> 00:58:26,129
<i>...as we go to Ginger Adams and some
young revelers in the 54th Street pen.</i>

1022
00:58:26,280 --> 00:58:27,327
<i>Ginger.</i>

1023
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:29,841
This little boy is lost.
Go with the nice lady.

1024
00:58:30,280 --> 00:58:32,886
- What's your name?
- Scott. I can't find my mom.

1025
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:35,122
Whoa! Who lost this kid?

1026
00:58:35,320 --> 00:58:36,765
I did, I did.

1027
00:58:36,920 --> 00:58:38,046
I'm coming, Mom.

1028
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:39,401
- I got him.
- Take it easy.

1029
00:58:39,560 --> 00:58:41,050
- Be careful.
- Whoa, thattaboy.

1030
00:58:41,240 --> 00:58:42,287
Watch it!

1031
00:58:42,440 --> 00:58:43,885
Mom, look at me.

1032
00:58:44,080 --> 00:58:45,445
I got him. I got him.

1033
00:58:48,080 --> 00:58:49,206
Hey, is she here?

1034
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:53,604
I haven't seen Piper's mom,
but I know she's around here somewhere.

1035
00:58:55,120 --> 00:58:58,124
- Who are you gonna kiss at midnight?
- You, baby.

1036
00:58:58,280 --> 00:59:00,681
I'm flattered, but I'm also spoken for.

1037
00:59:01,240 --> 00:59:05,768
<i>We now go live to New Year's headquarters
for an update on the situation.</i>

1038
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:13,807
Hello, I'm Claire Morgan
of the Times Square Alliance...

1039
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:16,770
...and, as you all can see...

1040
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:19,964
...the ball has stopped halfway
to its perch.

1041
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,241
It's suspended there to remind us...

1042
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:29,008
...before we pop the champagne
and celebrate the new year...

1043
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:33,848
...to stop...

1044
00:59:34,840 --> 00:59:38,003
...and reflect on the year
that has gone by.

1045
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:43,885
<i>To remember both our triumphs
and our missteps.</i>

1046
00:59:44,800 --> 00:59:48,600
<i>Our promises made and broken.</i>

1047
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:54,009
<i>The times we opened ourselves up
to great adventures...</i>

1048
00:59:54,600 --> 00:59:59,162
<i>...or closed ourself down
for fear of getting hurt.</i>

1049
01:00:00,520 --> 01:00:03,000
<i>Because that's what New Year's
is all about.</i>

1050
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:05,450
<i>Getting another chance.</i>

1051
01:00:06,800 --> 01:00:08,723
<i>A chance to forgive.</i>

1052
01:00:09,840 --> 01:00:15,051
To do better, to do more,
to give more, to love more.

1053
01:00:16,040 --> 01:00:19,203
<i>And to stop worrying about
"what if"...</i>

1054
01:00:19,360 --> 01:00:21,886
<i>...and start embracing what will be.</i>

1055
01:00:23,880 --> 01:00:26,531
<i>So when that ball drops at midnight...</i>

1056
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:28,929
<i>...and it will drop...</i>

1057
01:00:29,080 --> 01:00:32,607
<i>...let's remember to be nice
to each other.</i>

1058
01:00:34,280 --> 01:00:35,850
<i>Kind to each other.</i>

1059
01:00:36,680 --> 01:00:40,605
<i>And not just tonight, but all year long.</i>

1060
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:44,884
Thank you.

1061
01:00:56,880 --> 01:00:58,644
I want to hear the rest of your story.

1062
01:00:58,840 --> 01:01:02,128
We talked for... It felt like hours.

1063
01:01:02,440 --> 01:01:04,568
- You boink her?
- Dad.

1064
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:08,367
- You're talking to a man in a tuxedo.
- I can't talk like that in front of a lady.

1065
01:01:08,520 --> 01:01:11,251
- He's a gentleman.
- We talked, all right?

1066
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:15,962
I went on and on about the business
and how our stock had just gone public.

1067
01:01:16,120 --> 01:01:18,691
She stops me, she puts her hand
over mine and she says:

1068
01:01:18,840 --> 01:01:20,888
"That's all great, but how's your heart?"

1069
01:01:22,280 --> 01:01:24,567
"How's your he...?" Who says that?

1070
01:01:24,720 --> 01:01:28,042
- I mean, I never met anyone that said that...
- Please. Please.

1071
01:01:28,240 --> 01:01:29,526
Did you at least kiss her?

1072
01:01:29,680 --> 01:01:31,170
Yes. At midnight.

1073
01:01:32,520 --> 01:01:33,806
And that's it?

1074
01:01:34,120 --> 01:01:38,011
Well, I went to the restroom a little
bit later and when I came back...

1075
01:01:38,160 --> 01:01:39,605
- ...she was gone.
- Oh.

1076
01:01:40,360 --> 01:01:42,886
- She left something on the table.
- Naked picture?

1077
01:01:43,040 --> 01:01:44,121
Let me see.

1078
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:49,205
Read it out loud, Maude.

1079
01:01:50,560 --> 01:01:52,085
"Things are complicated.

1080
01:01:52,240 --> 01:01:54,641
If you're still thinking about me
in a year...

1081
01:01:54,800 --> 01:01:57,485
...meet me back here
at La Gambina Trattoria...

1082
01:01:57,640 --> 01:02:00,962
- ...at midnight next New Year's Eve."
- Midnight next New Year's Eve.

1083
01:02:01,120 --> 01:02:02,610
You memorized it.

1084
01:02:04,520 --> 01:02:06,284
You're gonna meet her, aren't you?

1085
01:02:06,560 --> 01:02:11,088
Yeah, I don't think so.
I mean, I don't even know her name.

1086
01:02:11,320 --> 01:02:13,084
You're afraid.

1087
01:02:13,240 --> 01:02:17,131
She's not gonna be there.
It was one night. It wasn't even real.

1088
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:22,081
But this napkin is. And you've been
carrying it around for a year.

1089
01:02:22,240 --> 01:02:24,322
I mean, you went out
for a slice of pizza...

1090
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:27,723
...and you may have run into the one.

1091
01:02:27,880 --> 01:02:29,086
You know what that is?

1092
01:02:29,480 --> 01:02:31,528
- Insanity?
- Not insanity.

1093
01:02:31,960 --> 01:02:33,803
Serendipity. Hmm?

1094
01:02:33,960 --> 01:02:37,362
- And you don't mess with serendipity.
- What's the worst that could happen?

1095
01:02:37,560 --> 01:02:39,722
She doesn't show up,
you go back to your party.

1096
01:02:41,560 --> 01:02:43,642
Oh, that's not it at all, is it, Sam?

1097
01:02:45,040 --> 01:02:47,611
You're afraid that she will show up.

1098
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:52,800
I'll tell you what.
I'll take care of this for you.

1099
01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:55,531
- I can tap this.
- He can tap this.

1100
01:02:55,680 --> 01:02:58,445
I'm gonna step up and tap this for you.
Look, I'm a widower.

1101
01:02:58,600 --> 01:03:00,204
- Right?
- Forgive him.

1102
01:03:08,120 --> 01:03:10,726
- Hey, sis.
- Have you heard from Hailey?

1103
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:13,850
- Calm down. What, is she AWOL?
- Yes.

1104
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:17,527
It's New Year's Eve. She's a teenager.
She's being her mother's daughter.

1105
01:03:17,680 --> 01:03:19,762
- Can you hold on for one second?
- Yeah, sure.

1106
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:21,445
I can't see.

1107
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:25,689
I was never that defiant.

1108
01:03:25,840 --> 01:03:29,049
I mean, you should've seen
the way she looked at me.

1109
01:03:29,240 --> 01:03:31,641
I'm confused.
I thought you had plans tonight.

1110
01:03:31,800 --> 01:03:33,962
<i>I sort of did.
But I chose to be with Hailey...</i>

1111
01:03:34,160 --> 01:03:35,969
...and now she's gone.

1112
01:03:36,160 --> 01:03:38,049
I'm not really worried about Hailey.

1113
01:03:38,200 --> 01:03:40,851
<i>I'm more worried about you.
If you're not working...</i>

1114
01:03:41,040 --> 01:03:44,567
...you need to have some fun. Let your
hair down. Leave the clogs at home.

1115
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:46,484
Oh, great, more clog commentary. Ooh.

1116
01:03:46,640 --> 01:03:48,881
Goodness. I'm so sorry, sir.

1117
01:03:49,040 --> 01:03:53,443
Listen, Paul, right now, all I really
need to do is just find Hailey.

1118
01:03:53,640 --> 01:03:54,687
All right, look.

1119
01:03:54,840 --> 01:03:57,320
<i>She's a good kid, okay?</i>

1120
01:03:58,400 --> 01:04:01,802
If she did happen to call her cool uncle
to say where she'd be...

1121
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:05,404
...she may, in fact, have said
the 54th Street pen.

1122
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:07,689
<i>But please don't rat out the cool uncle.</i>

1123
01:04:07,840 --> 01:04:10,650
Paul, thank you. Thank you so much.
Thank you. Excuse me.

1124
01:04:10,800 --> 01:04:12,211
<i>Wait, wait! Sis, hold on.</i>

1125
01:04:12,360 --> 01:04:15,523
- I got a huge favor to ask.
- Anything. What, what, what? What?

1126
01:04:18,240 --> 01:04:19,605
"Be amazed."

1127
01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:21,171
I got it.

1128
01:04:21,320 --> 01:04:24,051
Ingrid, please don't let this
whole thing be ruined...

1129
01:04:24,200 --> 01:04:26,123
...because I'm a big-mouthed idiot.

1130
01:04:26,520 --> 01:04:29,285
I'm sick and tired of being that guy.

1131
01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:31,969
Please, Ingrid.

1132
01:04:32,680 --> 01:04:34,170
Please.

1133
01:04:34,880 --> 01:04:36,450
Come with me.

1134
01:04:36,640 --> 01:04:37,880
Come on! Let's go.

1135
01:04:38,040 --> 01:04:39,371
On one condition.

1136
01:04:42,280 --> 01:04:45,284
- Whoo!
- Yeah, there you go.

1137
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:46,967
Here we go!

1138
01:04:47,120 --> 01:04:50,408
- See? All right, right turn. Lean into it.
- Aah!

1139
01:04:50,560 --> 01:04:51,925
<i>Lean, lean, lean.</i>

1140
01:04:53,240 --> 01:04:57,040
That was a nice speech.
- Well, I was just trying to save my job.

1141
01:04:57,240 --> 01:04:59,163
No, I don't think so.

1142
01:04:59,880 --> 01:05:01,609
I think you were talking about you.

1143
01:05:01,760 --> 01:05:06,448
Okay, maybe I was,
but all I can do is reflect...

1144
01:05:07,560 --> 01:05:09,244
...and try and do better next year.

1145
01:05:09,400 --> 01:05:10,640
Or sooner.

1146
01:05:12,200 --> 01:05:14,202
Now, why'd I tell you about him?

1147
01:05:14,360 --> 01:05:18,081
I'm a New York cop.
People, they tell me things.

1148
01:05:18,240 --> 01:05:20,004
I'm sure he's forgotten it by now.

1149
01:05:20,240 --> 01:05:21,366
You should go.

1150
01:05:22,080 --> 01:05:24,970
I don't move until the ball moves.

1151
01:05:25,720 --> 01:05:27,051
This is so exciting.

1152
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:29,806
In my entire life,
I have never won a contest before.

1153
01:05:29,960 --> 01:05:34,045
And I'm also excited about the baby.
I think that's the most exciting thing.

1154
01:05:35,320 --> 01:05:38,290
- Anchovy man.
- Yam liar.

1155
01:05:38,440 --> 01:05:41,683
- Grace, I'm gonna sign us in, okay?
- I'll just be right back.

1156
01:05:47,800 --> 01:05:51,327
- Griffin Byrne, checking in.
- Schwab, very proud to check in this hotel.

1157
01:05:51,480 --> 01:05:54,723
I'm sorry about James.
He's very competitive.

1158
01:05:54,880 --> 01:05:59,727
Well, I should apologize too.
I really didn't mean that anything was on.

1159
01:05:59,880 --> 01:06:01,689
Ooh.

1160
01:06:03,120 --> 01:06:04,963
- Contractions?
- Six minutes apart.

1161
01:06:05,120 --> 01:06:06,485
We have five minutes apart.

1162
01:06:06,640 --> 01:06:07,971
- Cervix?
- She has one.

1163
01:06:09,360 --> 01:06:12,250
- Four centimeters dilated.
- Four? We are five... Six... Seven!

1164
01:06:12,440 --> 01:06:13,566
Maybe eight.

1165
01:06:16,240 --> 01:06:18,242
Don't you show your head to me
young lady!

1166
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:21,529
Not yet! Papa will tell you
when it's time, okay?

1167
01:06:22,120 --> 01:06:24,691
- Oh, please don't yell at my vagina.
- Oh, I never will.

1168
01:06:24,840 --> 01:06:25,887
It's amazing.

1169
01:06:26,080 --> 01:06:28,401
She really listens to James.

1170
01:06:28,560 --> 01:06:30,562
She just crawled right back up in there.

1171
01:06:32,080 --> 01:06:33,969
The nurses will take you to your rooms.

1172
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:36,129
Gentlemen, to your corners.

1173
01:06:36,280 --> 01:06:39,409
And, ladies, may the best va-jay-jay win.

1174
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:42,929
Good luck.

1175
01:06:46,240 --> 01:06:48,561
- Let's see it. Ha-ha-ha.
- Let's see it.

1176
01:06:48,720 --> 01:06:50,245
<i>La la la</i>

1177
01:06:50,440 --> 01:06:52,522
Okay. Okay. Okay. I'll sing.

1178
01:06:52,680 --> 01:06:54,887
- You don't like my voice?
- You draw. I'll sing.

1179
01:06:55,040 --> 01:06:58,965
Laura, can we take a break?
Jensen's going on in a minute.

1180
01:07:00,040 --> 01:07:01,246
Do you want to go see?

1181
01:07:01,400 --> 01:07:05,291
No. I'm a professional,
I can't be seen gawking at the talent.

1182
01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:06,885
Well, I'm gonna gawk.

1183
01:07:07,120 --> 01:07:12,286
Ahh. I'm gonna try to get close to
the stage to get spit and sweat on.

1184
01:07:22,280 --> 01:07:26,001
<i>When the road gets dark</i>

1185
01:07:27,560 --> 01:07:32,805
<i>And you can no longer see</i>

1186
01:07:33,480 --> 01:07:37,769
<i>Let my love throw a spark</i>

1187
01:07:39,240 --> 01:07:44,246
<i>And have a little faith in me</i>

1188
01:07:50,720 --> 01:07:55,169
<i>And when the tears you cry</i>

1189
01:07:56,960 --> 01:08:01,807
<i>Are all you can believe</i>

1190
01:08:01,960 --> 01:08:06,761
<i>Just give these loving arms a try, baby</i>

1191
01:08:07,880 --> 01:08:12,010
<i>And have a little faith in me</i>

1192
01:08:12,160 --> 01:08:16,165
<i>Have a little faith in me</i>

1193
01:08:18,480 --> 01:08:21,689
<i>Have a little faith in me</i>

1194
01:08:24,280 --> 01:08:27,124
<i>Have a little faith in me</i>

1195
01:08:30,160 --> 01:08:34,449
<i>Have a little faith in me</i>

1196
01:08:37,320 --> 01:08:40,927
<i>'Cause I've been loving you
For such a long time, girl</i>

1197
01:08:41,080 --> 01:08:46,644
<i>Expecting nothing in return
Just for you to have a little faith in me</i>

1198
01:08:46,800 --> 01:08:50,964
<i>You see, time
Time is our friend</i>

1199
01:08:51,120 --> 01:08:53,361
<i>'Cause for us, there is no end</i>

1200
01:08:53,560 --> 01:08:58,646
<i>All you gotta do
ls, baby, have a little bit of faith in me</i>

1201
01:08:58,800 --> 01:09:02,247
<i>I said, I will hold you up
I will hold you up</i>

1202
01:09:02,400 --> 01:09:05,722
<i>I will hold you up
I will hold you up now</i>

1203
01:09:05,880 --> 01:09:09,885
<i>All you gotta do
ls have a little faith in me</i>

1204
01:09:10,080 --> 01:09:16,247
<i>You see, time is our friend</i>

1205
01:09:16,400 --> 01:09:19,085
<i>Oh, baby</i>

1206
01:09:21,520 --> 01:09:25,320
<i>Have a little faith in me</i>

1207
01:09:27,200 --> 01:09:32,200
<i>Have a little faith in me</i>

1208
01:09:38,240 --> 01:09:43,724
<i>Have a little faith in me</i>

1209
01:09:58,600 --> 01:10:00,125
All right, let me see.

1210
01:10:00,280 --> 01:10:01,805
Let me see.

1211
01:10:03,360 --> 01:10:04,441
That's me?

1212
01:10:04,600 --> 01:10:06,204
I look crazy.

1213
01:10:07,240 --> 01:10:09,163
- Do you have any other hobbies?
- Ha-ha-ha.

1214
01:10:17,160 --> 01:10:18,969
Hey.

1215
01:10:20,240 --> 01:10:21,571
There you...

1216
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:28,085
You're so good.

1217
01:10:29,480 --> 01:10:30,641
You always were.

1218
01:10:31,320 --> 01:10:33,448
I'm not really that good.

1219
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:35,682
Yes, you are. Yeah.

1220
01:10:35,840 --> 01:10:38,491
I was thinking about the ball drop...

1221
01:10:39,360 --> 01:10:42,330
...and how that always
used to be our thing.

1222
01:10:42,840 --> 01:10:46,606
Remember when I took you to New York
for the first time?

1223
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:49,565
We watched the ball drop together?
You remember?

1224
01:10:50,240 --> 01:10:51,810
That was our night.

1225
01:10:54,520 --> 01:10:56,807
And I promised you we'd bring...

1226
01:10:57,320 --> 01:11:00,085
We would go back there...

1227
01:11:01,080 --> 01:11:05,290
Well, another promise I didn't live up to.
I'm sorry.

1228
01:11:09,480 --> 01:11:11,050
Now, why did I leave you?

1229
01:11:15,880 --> 01:11:17,609
Stan, I'm Aimee.

1230
01:11:18,560 --> 01:11:20,642
Remember? Nurse Aimee?

1231
01:11:22,600 --> 01:11:24,045
Hmm?

1232
01:11:29,600 --> 01:11:32,171
Oh. Right.

1233
01:11:33,080 --> 01:11:35,367
Right. Aimee.

1234
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:49,846
Call me back or I'm gonna give away
your ticket. I'm gonna give it away.

1235
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:51,684
Paul, it's me, Murray. Are we ready to go?

1236
01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:52,887
Let's go!

1237
01:11:53,280 --> 01:11:56,045
Ladies and gentlemen,
one-night-only engagement.

1238
01:11:56,200 --> 01:12:00,967
Radio City Music Hall is proud to present,
on her resolution tour:

1239
01:12:01,240 --> 01:12:03,163
Ingrid Withers!

1240
01:12:03,320 --> 01:12:05,721
<i>Just hear those sleigh bells jingling.</i>

1241
01:12:05,920 --> 01:12:07,524
<i>Ring-ting-tingling too</i>

1242
01:12:07,680 --> 01:12:09,045
All right.

1243
01:12:11,280 --> 01:12:13,647
- Oh, my God. Whoo!
- Bravo!

1244
01:12:13,800 --> 01:12:14,847
Bravo!

1245
01:12:19,080 --> 01:12:20,127
Are you amazed?

1246
01:12:20,480 --> 01:12:23,051
I'm amazed you got me to do this!

1247
01:12:23,200 --> 01:12:24,531
Amazing!

1248
01:12:24,760 --> 01:12:27,331
"Be amazed"? Check.

1249
01:12:29,800 --> 01:12:30,926
<i>Come on, it's lovely weather</i>

1250
01:12:34,440 --> 01:12:35,487
This is great.

1251
01:12:35,640 --> 01:12:37,449
This is great. Okay.

1252
01:12:37,960 --> 01:12:40,122
Okay. Let me down now.

1253
01:12:44,320 --> 01:12:48,245
We've been stuck in here for hours.
I can't believe nobody's found us yet.

1254
01:12:53,680 --> 01:12:55,489
- We could have our own party.
- Hmm.

1255
01:12:55,960 --> 01:12:57,644
- I don't think so.
- Oh, come on!

1256
01:12:57,800 --> 01:13:02,522
We got to do something to get you
out of your New Year's Eve funk.

1257
01:13:05,040 --> 01:13:06,769
We're at a party.

1258
01:13:07,240 --> 01:13:08,321
Mm.

1259
01:13:09,880 --> 01:13:14,807
You're standing on one end of the room
alone, and I'm on the other.

1260
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:17,648
- We've never met.
- Ooh.

1261
01:13:17,800 --> 01:13:19,723
And the countdown begins.

1262
01:13:19,880 --> 01:13:23,327
You start scanning the room
for cute girls...

1263
01:13:23,480 --> 01:13:25,721
...amongst the sea of couples.

1264
01:13:25,920 --> 01:13:27,251
- Cute girls.
- Ten.

1265
01:13:27,640 --> 01:13:28,846
Nine.

1266
01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:30,851
Eight.

1267
01:13:31,840 --> 01:13:33,330
Seven.

1268
01:13:34,320 --> 01:13:36,129
Finally, you see me.

1269
01:13:36,280 --> 01:13:38,169
- Our eyes meet.
- There you are.

1270
01:13:38,720 --> 01:13:42,042
We smile tentatively at each other.

1271
01:13:42,240 --> 01:13:43,810
- Six.
- Tentatively.

1272
01:13:45,160 --> 01:13:47,606
Then we start walking
towards each other.

1273
01:13:48,120 --> 01:13:49,360
Five.

1274
01:13:49,800 --> 01:13:51,450
Finally, we meet.

1275
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:52,806
Four.

1276
01:13:52,960 --> 01:13:55,008
Just as it's about to be midnight.

1277
01:13:55,920 --> 01:13:57,410
- Three.
- Three.

1278
01:13:59,120 --> 01:14:00,610
- Two.
- Two.

1279
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:04,647
One.

1280
01:14:18,800 --> 01:14:19,847
Oh.

1281
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:21,570
- Hey!
- Now you come.

1282
01:14:22,720 --> 01:14:24,051
Hmm.

1283
01:14:24,720 --> 01:14:28,167
See, I told you I'd have it fixed.
In just eight hours.

1284
01:14:30,080 --> 01:14:31,650
Phone's broken.

1285
01:14:31,800 --> 01:14:35,691
Hey, you didn't, uh, you know...

1286
01:14:35,840 --> 01:14:37,842
That's not why we put the bench in.

1287
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:41,322
Oh, no, no. It's not like that.

1288
01:14:41,480 --> 01:14:43,721
Yeah, it's always like that.

1289
01:14:43,880 --> 01:14:46,690
- This was not like that.
- Oh, it's always like that.

1290
01:14:46,840 --> 01:14:50,890
- We just met on...
- All right. I'll check out the video.

1291
01:14:51,680 --> 01:14:53,011
Okay.

1292
01:14:53,360 --> 01:14:55,522
All right! Come on in.

1293
01:14:55,680 --> 01:14:58,126
- Looks like you still might make your gig.
- Yeah.

1294
01:14:58,440 --> 01:15:00,204
So Jensen's playing at Times Square?

1295
01:15:00,360 --> 01:15:04,922
Yeah. With or without me,
so I should really get going.

1296
01:15:08,600 --> 01:15:10,011
Okay.

1297
01:15:11,520 --> 01:15:14,569
- See you.
- Yeah. Happy New... Uh...

1298
01:15:15,320 --> 01:15:16,526
I'll see you.

1299
01:15:20,600 --> 01:15:21,761
Uh...

1300
01:15:21,920 --> 01:15:23,285
Let me...

1301
01:15:24,320 --> 01:15:25,401
Sorry.

1302
01:15:30,640 --> 01:15:31,687
Hold the elevator.

1303
01:15:33,040 --> 01:15:34,644
Sorry. Let me just...

1304
01:15:35,040 --> 01:15:37,088
This gate is a bitch.

1305
01:15:46,840 --> 01:15:49,844
- Mrs. Lifflander, you've been working out.
- Thank you.

1306
01:15:55,320 --> 01:15:57,322
Hey, you forgot"!

1307
01:16:01,240 --> 01:16:03,402
Oh, this is amazing,
I can totally see him.

1308
01:16:03,720 --> 01:16:06,963
What?! He's coming out?
You can see him?

1309
01:16:07,440 --> 01:16:09,841
Okay, if you try to see, I can't see.

1310
01:16:10,040 --> 01:16:11,724
Look with your other eye!

1311
01:16:11,920 --> 01:16:15,129
Oh, hostility, that's good.
Yes, now we're getting somewhere.

1312
01:16:15,280 --> 01:16:18,568
I can't see the baby. I can see that couple
trying to steal our money.

1313
01:16:18,760 --> 01:16:20,000
Oh, this is great, babe.

1314
01:16:20,160 --> 01:16:23,050
So, look, if I do this, that means
they're having their baby.

1315
01:16:23,200 --> 01:16:24,884
I don't care about the money any more.

1316
01:16:25,040 --> 01:16:27,407
What?
- Hey, Griff?

1317
01:16:27,600 --> 01:16:28,681
Come here.

1318
01:16:29,640 --> 01:16:33,008
- You are disturbing her calm zone.
- You're disturbing my calm zone.

1319
01:16:33,160 --> 01:16:34,650
What? Uhn.

1320
01:16:36,240 --> 01:16:38,402
I need you to focus.

1321
01:16:39,320 --> 01:16:43,803
I'm just trying to squeeze a giant Escalade
out of a compact fucking parking spot!

1322
01:16:44,480 --> 01:16:45,720
Nice.

1323
01:16:45,880 --> 01:16:49,362
Swearing helps sometimes.
But now we're gonna use our words, right?

1324
01:16:50,480 --> 01:16:52,164
- We're ready to go.
- Uh...

1325
01:16:53,520 --> 01:16:54,567
Bye, I love you.

1326
01:16:54,720 --> 01:16:57,769
- Time to take the children to the playroom.
- Come on, guys.

1327
01:16:57,960 --> 01:17:01,965
Next time I see you, you're gonna
have a baby sister. I love you.

1328
01:17:02,120 --> 01:17:04,168
- Bye, Mommy.
- Bye.

1329
01:17:04,320 --> 01:17:06,891
- A lobster?
- Yeah.

1330
01:17:07,040 --> 01:17:08,326
Dissolve.

1331
01:17:08,480 --> 01:17:10,403
Dissolve.

1332
01:17:10,600 --> 01:17:14,889
Assuage.

1333
01:17:20,160 --> 01:17:22,128
Very good. You are the channel.

1334
01:17:23,200 --> 01:17:24,850
I am the perfect channel.

1335
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:26,809
- Perfect channel.
- Ooh...

1336
01:17:27,160 --> 01:17:28,571
Okay.

1337
01:17:29,360 --> 01:17:32,091
- Change the channel. Change it!
Mm-hm.

1338
01:17:32,240 --> 01:17:33,571
Click, click, click.

1339
01:17:42,960 --> 01:17:46,009
- Watch it.
- What happened to the steps there? Hey.

1340
01:17:46,440 --> 01:17:50,161
It's been a real treat getting to know you
and the family. Grandpa Jed.

1341
01:17:50,320 --> 01:17:51,526
Very cool, very horny.

1342
01:17:51,680 --> 01:17:54,251
You got a chance to see how
the other half lives, huh?

1343
01:17:54,400 --> 01:17:56,209
You make the other half look good.

1344
01:17:56,440 --> 01:17:58,886
Ah. You seem to have a pretty fun life.

1345
01:17:59,040 --> 01:18:00,166
It has its moments.

1346
01:18:00,360 --> 01:18:03,762
- Remember, follow your heart.
- All right, I will. I'll see you.

1347
01:18:07,920 --> 01:18:09,604
- You have to let me in!
- I'm sorry.

1348
01:18:09,760 --> 01:18:11,364
You need a pass to get back there.

1349
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:14,091
I'm practically related to him.
We're both from Jersey.

1350
01:18:14,240 --> 01:18:16,811
- Is this the 54th Street pen?
- 56th. 54th is that way.

1351
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:19,731
- You have to let me in.
- Without a pass, I can't.

1352
01:18:22,440 --> 01:18:25,125
Hailey's coming.
- Yeah.

1353
01:18:25,960 --> 01:18:29,282
<i>We're getting closer, folks.
Hope you're staying warm.</i>

1354
01:18:30,680 --> 01:18:35,049
This is it. This is as close to
the ball dropping as I can get you.

1355
01:18:35,200 --> 01:18:37,931
Hey, good luck with that last one,
all right?

1356
01:18:38,080 --> 01:18:39,127
No.

1357
01:18:39,280 --> 01:18:43,001
- I figured that was a long shot.
- A long shot? What are you talking about?

1358
01:18:43,160 --> 01:18:45,128
Going to Bali? That was a long shot.

1359
01:18:47,560 --> 01:18:49,164
Let's get this out of here, okay?

1360
01:18:49,320 --> 01:18:52,130
Man, I don't even know whose
this is, bro. I'm just saying.

1361
01:18:52,400 --> 01:18:53,447
Thanks.

1362
01:18:54,440 --> 01:18:55,885
Make a list of your own.

1363
01:18:56,600 --> 01:18:58,443
Don't wait as long as I did.

1364
01:18:58,640 --> 01:19:00,449
Pow, pow, shwing.

1365
01:19:00,600 --> 01:19:02,648
Thank you. Mm.

1366
01:19:04,040 --> 01:19:05,280
Good bye.

1367
01:19:07,560 --> 01:19:08,686
Good bye.

1368
01:19:10,800 --> 01:19:13,963
- Have a great time.
- You too. Happy New Year, Ingrid.

1369
01:19:16,520 --> 01:19:18,170
Whoo.

1370
01:19:26,760 --> 01:19:29,843
Any ideas who you might
want to kiss at midnight?

1371
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:31,411
Oh.

1372
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:33,284
- Hey, Laura!
- Ha-ha-ha.

1373
01:19:33,440 --> 01:19:35,727
- They're raving about the food out there.
- Great.

1374
01:19:35,880 --> 01:19:38,850
I hear this is a first for
the music industry.

1375
01:19:39,280 --> 01:19:42,045
Sam's here.
- He is.

1376
01:19:42,600 --> 01:19:44,090
Sam!
- Oh, hey, Alyssa.

1377
01:19:44,240 --> 01:19:46,129
- I'll get your favorite drink?
- Thank you.

1378
01:19:47,920 --> 01:19:49,763
Hey, Mom.

1379
01:19:49,920 --> 01:19:51,001
Sorry I'm late.

1380
01:19:51,160 --> 01:19:52,400
But I made it.

1381
01:19:52,560 --> 01:19:55,166
Thank you for wearing
your father's tuxedo.

1382
01:19:55,320 --> 01:19:58,403
- Perfect fit, huh?
- You look so handsome.

1383
01:19:58,600 --> 01:20:00,602
Hey there, iPod. How are you?

1384
01:20:00,800 --> 01:20:02,609
All your pretty little girls are here.

1385
01:20:02,760 --> 01:20:04,728
I'm starting to think I need more...

1386
01:20:04,880 --> 01:20:07,486
...than a pretty a girl with nothing
to say, you know?

1387
01:20:07,640 --> 01:20:09,483
Did maturity just walk into the room?

1388
01:20:09,880 --> 01:20:11,848
Well, maybe, maybe not.

1389
01:20:12,640 --> 01:20:14,768
You know what you're gonna say
to these people?

1390
01:20:15,200 --> 01:20:17,680
Yes. Yes, I do.

1391
01:20:17,880 --> 01:20:22,647
<i>Coming up next on the main stage,
Ahern Records recording artist, Jensen!</i>

1392
01:20:25,400 --> 01:20:27,368
- Where's Jensen?
- Still waiting on him.

1393
01:20:27,520 --> 01:20:31,081
But the president of the Times Square
Alliance would like a word.

1394
01:20:31,240 --> 01:20:34,244
- Mr. Buellerton's here?
- He's right here.

1395
01:20:36,240 --> 01:20:38,242
Mr. Buellerton. You wanted to see me?

1396
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:39,925
Yes, Claire.

1397
01:20:40,080 --> 01:20:42,526
You spoke eloquently about the ball
getting stuck.

1398
01:20:42,680 --> 01:20:44,842
- You assuaged everyone's fears.
- Thank you.

1399
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:47,082
- Except mine.
- Oh, of course.

1400
01:20:47,240 --> 01:20:50,528
Now, I like assuagion, but I don't
think you realize what's at stake.

1401
01:20:50,680 --> 01:20:51,727
Oh, I do, sir.

1402
01:20:51,880 --> 01:20:54,360
You're about to let down
the city of New York...

1403
01:20:54,520 --> 01:20:58,081
...the country, the whole world,
unless you get that ball fixed.

1404
01:20:59,640 --> 01:21:04,601
With all due respect, sir, I've been watching
the ball drop since I was 5 years old...

1405
01:21:04,760 --> 01:21:07,411
...and it's one of my most favorite
family memories.

1406
01:21:07,560 --> 01:21:09,562
We'll... We'll be sure to get this fixed.

1407
01:21:09,720 --> 01:21:11,290
"We'll"? "We'll"?

1408
01:21:11,440 --> 01:21:14,284
You remember the '86 Mets-Red Sox
World Series?

1409
01:21:14,440 --> 01:21:15,566
No.

1410
01:21:15,960 --> 01:21:18,440
Bill Buckner let a ground ball
go between his legs...

1411
01:21:18,680 --> 01:21:21,889
...and the Sox lost the game,
and eventually, the World Series.

1412
01:21:22,040 --> 01:21:25,123
Now, very few people remember
who was on the field that day...

1413
01:21:25,280 --> 01:21:28,727
...but everyone remembers
that Buckner missed the ball.

1414
01:21:28,880 --> 01:21:31,963
A baseball's a lot smaller than your ball,
which is not dropping.

1415
01:21:32,120 --> 01:21:36,887
Right. I'll be sure that I don't drop
the ball on the ball drop.

1416
01:21:37,040 --> 01:21:39,327
- Whatever you said. Anyway, fix it.
- I will.

1417
01:21:39,480 --> 01:21:43,724
Or you'll hear a speech about the new vice
president of the Times Square Alliance.

1418
01:21:43,880 --> 01:21:47,248
Okay. I'm not gonna let you down,
or the world. I promise, sir.

1419
01:21:48,480 --> 01:21:52,280
Um, okay, I'm gonna check on Kominsky.
You find Jensen.

1420
01:21:52,840 --> 01:21:54,649
Somebody get me Jensen!

1421
01:21:54,840 --> 01:21:57,411
- Hey, sorry I'm late.
- Okay. Who are you?

1422
01:21:57,560 --> 01:21:59,642
I'm Elise, one of Jensen's
backup singers.

1423
01:21:59,800 --> 01:22:00,926
Where's Jensen?

1424
01:22:01,080 --> 01:22:02,161
I don't know.

1425
01:22:02,320 --> 01:22:04,288
Go take the stage. That way, that way.

1426
01:22:04,480 --> 01:22:06,608
- Where is he?
<i>- Still</i> no rock star.

1427
01:22:06,760 --> 01:22:09,843
Hey! 5B! Hi.
- Hey. Hi. Randy.

1428
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:11,684
How'd you get in?

1429
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:14,002
They think I'm Jensen's drummer.

1430
01:22:14,160 --> 01:22:15,366
Because I told them that.

1431
01:22:15,760 --> 01:22:20,527
Here. You left this on the elevator.
I didn't know if it was lucky or something.

1432
01:22:20,720 --> 01:22:22,165
And also it's a balance thing.

1433
01:22:22,320 --> 01:22:26,609
So if you dance while you're singing,
you'll need your balance.

1434
01:22:26,760 --> 01:22:27,807
Thanks.

1435
01:22:28,240 --> 01:22:33,451
You came all the way here to bring me
my rubber bracelet?

1436
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:34,931
Sort of.

1437
01:22:35,080 --> 01:22:38,289
And to say happy New Year.

1438
01:22:41,720 --> 01:22:43,563
Happy New Year, Randy.

1439
01:22:45,840 --> 01:22:48,571
Oh, you also left something else
on the elevator.

1440
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:01,570
Glad you remembered that.

1441
01:23:02,840 --> 01:23:04,888
<i>Background singers report to stage.</i>

1442
01:23:05,520 --> 01:23:06,885
I gotta go. Ha-ha.

1443
01:23:07,080 --> 01:23:08,730
Okay, well, go watch.

1444
01:23:08,920 --> 01:23:12,527
- For you, I will be your groupie.
- Thank you. Thank you.

1445
01:23:12,680 --> 01:23:14,887
Hey! Nice pajamas.

1446
01:23:15,040 --> 01:23:17,008
<i>Background singers report to stage.</i>

1447
01:23:17,160 --> 01:23:19,561
Keep them busy. Try doing the wave.

1448
01:23:19,760 --> 01:23:22,411
If Jensen doesn't show up,
you're gonna sing.

1449
01:23:22,600 --> 01:23:24,250
- Jensen's here.
- Where?

1450
01:23:24,400 --> 01:23:26,767
- He's not happy.
- Oh. Why would he be?

1451
01:23:29,560 --> 01:23:32,882
Mr. Jensen, hi.
What seems to be the problem?

1452
01:23:33,040 --> 01:23:35,407
Yeah, I saw your speech on TV today.

1453
01:23:35,560 --> 01:23:38,609
I'm Claire Morgan.
I'm the one that hired you.

1454
01:23:38,760 --> 01:23:40,922
Hi. Boy meets girl...

1455
01:23:41,080 --> 01:23:44,402
- ...boy screws up, boy loses girl.
- Oh.

1456
01:23:44,600 --> 01:23:47,444
Um... ls there any way I can help you?

1457
01:23:47,600 --> 01:23:49,090
I don't think so.

1458
01:23:49,240 --> 01:23:52,449
Well, it is New Year's Eve.
Anything's possible.

1459
01:23:52,600 --> 01:23:55,285
Not this time.
I think I really screwed it up.

1460
01:23:55,440 --> 01:23:57,966
I don't think I deserve a second chance.

1461
01:23:58,800 --> 01:24:00,325
You know what that feels like?

1462
01:24:01,920 --> 01:24:04,161
Actually, I do.

1463
01:24:04,320 --> 01:24:07,961
I have the same situation
going on right now.

1464
01:24:08,120 --> 01:24:09,565
Um...

1465
01:24:10,960 --> 01:24:14,248
Maybe all this is too much for her, huh?
I don't know. Maybe...

1466
01:24:15,960 --> 01:24:19,487
Maybe all she wants is to not have to
share you with the rest of the world.

1467
01:24:21,600 --> 01:24:22,965
Sounds familiar.

1468
01:24:23,160 --> 01:24:25,640
- We girls, we have a handbook.
- Miss Morgan.

1469
01:24:27,640 --> 01:24:32,726
Um... Well, I need to go fix the ball,
and you need to fix what you broke too.

1470
01:24:32,920 --> 01:24:34,490
But will you please sing first?

1471
01:24:34,880 --> 01:24:35,961
Please.

1472
01:24:36,400 --> 01:24:40,564
And don't forget, second chances,
they don't expire until midnight.

1473
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:42,286
Okay?

1474
01:24:43,400 --> 01:24:44,845
Thanks.

1475
01:24:45,400 --> 01:24:46,925
You rock.

1476
01:24:47,080 --> 01:24:48,844
- Ha-ha.
- I'm a big fan.

1477
01:24:49,320 --> 01:24:50,651
Thank you.

1478
01:24:50,800 --> 01:24:53,531
Goodbye, 2011!

1479
01:24:55,440 --> 01:24:57,169
New Year's wave!

1480
01:24:57,440 --> 01:25:01,525
Hi. I am Sam Ahern, Jr.

1481
01:25:02,480 --> 01:25:03,845
I won't give a long speech.

1482
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:07,368
Socrates gave long speeches
and his friends killed him.

1483
01:25:09,160 --> 01:25:12,209
In the past, my father would
always kick things off...

1484
01:25:12,360 --> 01:25:14,601
...and then turn it over
to the vice presidents...

1485
01:25:14,760 --> 01:25:17,331
...but as you know,
Dad's not with us any more.

1486
01:25:18,040 --> 01:25:22,523
I think that anybody that knew him
knows that he was a great man.

1487
01:25:24,480 --> 01:25:27,245
And we're thinking
about you tonight, Pops.

1488
01:25:30,320 --> 01:25:31,731
He always ended with a quote.

1489
01:25:31,880 --> 01:25:36,681
He would say, "What would you do today
if you knew you would not fail?"

1490
01:25:37,120 --> 01:25:40,169
And then he'd say,
"Now go out and do it."

1491
01:25:41,120 --> 01:25:43,088
You know where he got that from?

1492
01:25:44,200 --> 01:25:46,646
My mother, Rose Ahern.

1493
01:25:49,080 --> 01:25:53,688
All right, let me finish with this.
As we move forward into this new year...

1494
01:25:54,240 --> 01:25:57,687
...let's try to remember that
sometimes it's okay...

1495
01:25:57,880 --> 01:25:59,564
...to listen to your heart.

1496
01:25:59,720 --> 01:26:01,643
I know it's risky.

1497
01:26:03,160 --> 01:26:04,969
Take that leap of faith.

1498
01:26:06,560 --> 01:26:08,403
Happy New Year, everybody.

1499
01:26:11,440 --> 01:26:12,851
Excuse me. Excuse me.

1500
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:14,604
All right, let's do this.

1501
01:26:14,920 --> 01:26:16,922
Ladies and gentlemen, Jensen!

1502
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:33,606
Come here! Why don't you have one on?
Come on!

1503
01:26:37,040 --> 01:26:39,441
<i>I can't turn you loose now</i>

1504
01:26:39,600 --> 01:26:43,127
<i>If I do I'm gonna lose my life</i>

1505
01:26:43,280 --> 01:26:45,601
<i>I'm never turning you loose now</i>

1506
01:26:45,800 --> 01:26:49,282
<i>If I do I'm gonna lose my mind</i>

1507
01:26:49,440 --> 01:26:51,886
<i>I can't turn you loose to nobody</i>

1508
01:26:52,040 --> 01:26:55,283
<i>'Cause I love you baby
Yes, I do now</i>

1509
01:26:55,480 --> 01:26:58,131
<i>Hip-shaking mama, I told ya</i>

1510
01:26:58,280 --> 01:27:01,204
<i>Oh, honey, I'm in love with you now</i>

1511
01:27:02,640 --> 01:27:03,971
It's okay. They got it.

1512
01:27:04,120 --> 01:27:07,044
<i>I wanna give you everything
That you want</i>

1513
01:27:07,240 --> 01:27:09,163
<i>Gotta, gotta, gotta</i>

1514
01:27:09,320 --> 01:27:12,369
<i>Keep on lovin', baby</i>

1515
01:27:12,520 --> 01:27:14,807
<i>Never gonna turn you loose</i>

1516
01:27:16,320 --> 01:27:20,484
<i>I gotta keep on
Huh!</i>

1517
01:27:33,600 --> 01:27:35,125
After.

1518
01:27:35,320 --> 01:27:39,006
Okay, almost. One more test.
One more test, my darling. Okay.

1519
01:27:39,160 --> 01:27:41,128
I get this wire here.

1520
01:27:41,280 --> 01:27:42,850
Uh...

1521
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:44,047
I got it!

1522
01:27:45,520 --> 01:27:47,682
I put new one inside! Okay, baby!

1523
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:49,968
- Mwah!
- Does it work?

1524
01:27:50,120 --> 01:27:51,963
Flip switch!

1525
01:27:52,360 --> 01:27:55,011
I'm flipping. I'm flipping up.

1526
01:27:57,320 --> 01:27:58,367
It's working.

1527
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:01,526
It's going up. It's going up!

1528
01:28:01,680 --> 01:28:04,968
Hang on, Kominsky!
Tell Miss Morgan it's working.

1529
01:28:05,120 --> 01:28:06,360
He's got it!

1530
01:28:09,560 --> 01:28:12,291
Wait, wait! Get me down first!
First, down!

1531
01:28:12,440 --> 01:28:14,488
Coming down! Flipping down!

1532
01:28:14,840 --> 01:28:16,330
Way to go, buddy!

1533
01:28:16,480 --> 01:28:18,528
Mr. Kominsky, tell us, how does it feel?

1534
01:28:18,680 --> 01:28:20,842
Well, it feels okay.
Everyone talking at me.

1535
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:22,650
Wade said the mayor called.

1536
01:28:22,800 --> 01:28:24,564
- He wants you to come down there.
- Now?

1537
01:28:24,720 --> 01:28:27,405
He thought what you said
a lot of us needed to hear.

1538
01:28:27,720 --> 01:28:30,166
Tell Mayor Bloomberg I'd love to.

1539
01:28:32,880 --> 01:28:37,329
But I have another pressing matter
that needs attending.

1540
01:28:43,360 --> 01:28:45,089
- Mr. Kominsky?
- Yes.

1541
01:28:45,240 --> 01:28:48,642
As a reward for 37 years of service...

1542
01:28:48,840 --> 01:28:52,367
...before being temporarily
relieved of your duties...

1543
01:28:52,520 --> 01:28:55,251
...I officially hereby leave you in charge.

1544
01:28:58,760 --> 01:29:00,603
What took so long?

1545
01:29:01,080 --> 01:29:02,127
Thank you.

1546
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:04,047
Thank you.

1547
01:29:07,520 --> 01:29:08,601
Watch him like a hawk.

1548
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:11,890
You got it. Let me find Nolan
to give you a lift, though.

1549
01:29:12,040 --> 01:29:13,724
Officer Nolan's right here.

1550
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:16,490
Hi.

1551
01:29:19,720 --> 01:29:20,881
Hi, Tanya.

1552
01:29:21,080 --> 01:29:22,525
Go see your daddy.

1553
01:29:23,440 --> 01:29:24,851
Hey, baby.

1554
01:29:26,080 --> 01:29:27,525
Hi, Daddy.

1555
01:29:27,680 --> 01:29:29,284
My little rugrats.

1556
01:29:29,440 --> 01:29:30,885
Heard you need a lift.

1557
01:29:31,040 --> 01:29:33,441
No. In a car.

1558
01:29:33,800 --> 01:29:35,370
Yeah, we have cars too.

1559
01:29:36,440 --> 01:29:37,805
Happy New Year, Brendan.

1560
01:29:37,960 --> 01:29:39,610
Happy New Year, Claire.

1561
01:29:40,720 --> 01:29:42,609
Ah... Alyssa, thank you.

1562
01:29:42,760 --> 01:29:45,445
Your favorite, Disaronno and cranberry.

1563
01:29:46,480 --> 01:29:48,960
Um... I'm off at 1.

1564
01:29:49,680 --> 01:29:52,331
- I will keep that in mind.
- Okay.

1565
01:29:53,320 --> 01:29:54,560
Hey, Sam.

1566
01:29:54,720 --> 01:29:57,246
- Wendy! How are you?
- Great.

1567
01:29:57,400 --> 01:29:58,890
- You look fantastic.
- Thanks.

1568
01:29:59,080 --> 01:30:00,127
Sam?

1569
01:30:00,280 --> 01:30:02,487
- Patty.
- I'd love to be the woman behind you.

1570
01:30:02,640 --> 01:30:05,007
And I'd love to be in front.

1571
01:30:05,200 --> 01:30:07,487
Oh. I'm a Sam-wich.

1572
01:30:09,560 --> 01:30:12,006
- How's everything? Okay?
- It was wonderful.

1573
01:30:12,160 --> 01:30:13,571
- It was delicious.
- Thank you.

1574
01:30:13,760 --> 01:30:16,161
I have to say that he was
absolutely right.

1575
01:30:16,320 --> 01:30:18,084
The food is sublime.

1576
01:30:18,240 --> 01:30:21,244
Thank you. Thank you so much.
That's great to hear.

1577
01:30:21,400 --> 01:30:22,606
Who was right?

1578
01:30:22,920 --> 01:30:27,403
Jensen. He told us that we had to hire you
or he wouldn't sing tonight.

1579
01:30:27,680 --> 01:30:28,727
Ah.

1580
01:30:28,880 --> 01:30:32,362
I'm gonna recommend you to everyone
I know, and, honey, I know a lot of people.

1581
01:30:32,640 --> 01:30:34,165
Thank you.

1582
01:30:39,480 --> 01:30:42,370
I'll give you my new condo number
and my new cell.

1583
01:30:43,600 --> 01:30:46,365
You ran out on us last New Year's.
Do you remember that?

1584
01:30:46,520 --> 01:30:47,521
Here you go.

1585
01:30:49,760 --> 01:30:51,125
Fun.

1586
01:30:51,320 --> 01:30:53,049
You know what? I'm sorry.

1587
01:30:53,520 --> 01:30:55,761
I can't do it. I gotta go.

1588
01:30:57,520 --> 01:30:59,090
I'm sorry.

1589
01:31:01,200 --> 01:31:03,009
Make a hole, people!

1590
01:31:23,440 --> 01:31:24,885
Stan.

1591
01:31:25,240 --> 01:31:27,208
It's just me, Aimee.

1592
01:31:28,520 --> 01:31:32,241
Please go.
I don't want you to see it happen.

1593
01:31:32,400 --> 01:31:34,528
No, I'm not gonna leave you alone.

1594
01:31:34,680 --> 01:31:35,806
He's not alone.

1595
01:31:47,760 --> 01:31:49,091
Hi, Daddy.

1596
01:31:52,880 --> 01:31:55,087
Hey. Kiddo.

1597
01:31:57,800 --> 01:31:59,768
Hey, kid.

1598
01:32:00,200 --> 01:32:01,770
Did we miss it?

1599
01:32:02,600 --> 01:32:04,523
Ball hasn't dropped yet.

1600
01:32:06,120 --> 01:32:07,804
You're really here.

1601
01:32:08,720 --> 01:32:10,085
Yeah.

1602
01:32:13,240 --> 01:32:15,402
Well, my shift is up.

1603
01:32:15,560 --> 01:32:18,211
- Have a happy New Year, Aimee.
- Thank you.

1604
01:32:18,360 --> 01:32:22,285
- How about some holiday cake?
- Nope. Don't need it.

1605
01:32:24,360 --> 01:32:26,966
<i>Dessert is now being served.</i>

1606
01:32:30,640 --> 01:32:31,971
Chocolate truffles.

1607
01:32:33,120 --> 01:32:34,804
This is working!

1608
01:32:35,120 --> 01:32:38,647
- I'm gonna grab some more parachutes.
Okay. We'll keep throwing.

1609
01:32:38,840 --> 01:32:40,968
Throw it at the pretty ones!

1610
01:32:41,640 --> 01:32:45,725
I really would like to speak with you
about Miss Pearlman.

1611
01:32:45,880 --> 01:32:47,803
She's not doing too well today.

1612
01:32:47,960 --> 01:32:51,169
She has a high fever, but he didn't
really leave any more orders.

1613
01:32:51,320 --> 01:32:54,608
So we really would like you to come in
and take a look at her.

1614
01:32:54,760 --> 01:32:56,364
Thank you, bye.

1615
01:32:58,600 --> 01:33:01,126
- So, what do you think?
- Wow.

1616
01:33:01,280 --> 01:33:04,011
Somebody's gonna have
a happy New Year.

1617
01:33:04,400 --> 01:33:06,801
I sure hope so.

1618
01:33:07,160 --> 01:33:09,367
Ha-ha.
- Aimee, Aimee!

1619
01:33:09,800 --> 01:33:11,689
Come here. Quick, quick.

1620
01:33:12,280 --> 01:33:15,648
- Mr. Harris isn't in his bed.
- I know.

1621
01:33:15,800 --> 01:33:18,485
- So should I look for him?
- No. It's okay.

1622
01:33:18,720 --> 01:33:19,767
You look hot.

1623
01:33:23,200 --> 01:33:24,611
I can do this.

1624
01:33:25,520 --> 01:33:26,965
I can do this.

1625
01:33:27,160 --> 01:33:29,128
Hang in there, babydoll.

1626
01:33:31,680 --> 01:33:33,284
We made it on time.

1627
01:33:33,440 --> 01:33:35,920
- It's our thing.
- Yeah.

1628
01:33:36,600 --> 01:33:39,524
You want me to put you
on my shoulders?

1629
01:33:45,160 --> 01:33:47,208
Wowee-wow.

1630
01:33:47,360 --> 01:33:50,364
Where in the world is
the rest of that dress?

1631
01:33:50,560 --> 01:33:52,688
New Year's is all about the dress.

1632
01:33:52,840 --> 01:33:55,127
You said that we could change
before dessert.

1633
01:33:55,280 --> 01:33:57,567
There's nothing wrong
in show a little something.

1634
01:33:57,720 --> 01:34:00,007
Trust me, but there's nothing little
about those.

1635
01:34:00,160 --> 01:34:03,562
- What, did one fell off?
- No, no. They didn't fall off.

1636
01:34:03,720 --> 01:34:06,326
They are still there.
You look great. Perfect, in fact.

1637
01:34:06,480 --> 01:34:08,403
You mind taking these
parachutes upstairs?

1638
01:34:08,560 --> 01:34:10,210
- Okay.
- Thank you.

1639
01:34:10,360 --> 01:34:12,727
You're going out there
to celebrate with us?

1640
01:34:12,920 --> 01:34:15,400
No. I'll just hang here.

1641
01:34:16,720 --> 01:34:18,563
No, it's fine. I'm good.

1642
01:34:18,720 --> 01:34:20,404
Okay, I take the parachutes.

1643
01:34:20,560 --> 01:34:22,050
Thank you.

1644
01:34:30,160 --> 01:34:33,289
Dr. Steam, to the Ira Keenan lounge.

1645
01:34:47,760 --> 01:34:48,921
<i>Hi.</i>

1646
01:34:49,120 --> 01:34:50,121
What do you think?

1647
01:34:50,280 --> 01:34:54,251
<i>Oh, I love it, I love it.
You look so beautiful</i>

1648
01:34:54,400 --> 01:34:56,562
<i>I think I need to be there.</i>

1649
01:34:56,760 --> 01:34:59,286
Ha-ha. I think I wish you were.

1650
01:35:00,520 --> 01:35:02,124
Hi, baby.

1651
01:35:02,920 --> 01:35:03,967
<i>How've you been?</i>

1652
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:06,445
I'm okay.

1653
01:35:07,040 --> 01:35:10,522
<i>The guys are all watching
Times Square on TV right now.</i>

1654
01:35:10,800 --> 01:35:13,804
<i>I tell them I'm better off.
I'm watching you.</i>

1655
01:35:17,040 --> 01:35:20,761
I miss you so much.

1656
01:35:22,720 --> 01:35:24,927
<i>I miss you too, baby</i>

1657
01:35:25,960 --> 01:35:27,371
<i>I do.</i>

1658
01:35:27,760 --> 01:35:32,163
But you know what?
This is gonna be a great new year...

1659
01:35:32,320 --> 01:35:35,085
...because you're coming home
really soon.

1660
01:35:36,800 --> 01:35:38,006
<i>I hope so</i>

1661
01:35:38,880 --> 01:35:40,086
You are.

1662
01:35:40,240 --> 01:35:42,288
<i>Yeah. Happy New Year.</i>

1663
01:35:43,840 --> 01:35:45,649
Happy New Year.

1664
01:35:55,320 --> 01:35:56,890
Kitchen still open?

1665
01:36:00,480 --> 01:36:01,686
Mm-hm.

1666
01:36:02,320 --> 01:36:03,890
Yep.

1667
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:14,570
For dessert it is.

1668
01:36:14,840 --> 01:36:18,208
- Ha-ha.
- We got Jell-O. We got cupcakes, truffles.

1669
01:36:18,560 --> 01:36:19,846
Mm.

1670
01:36:20,040 --> 01:36:23,761
So you talked Mrs. Ahern
into hiring me tonight, huh?

1671
01:36:24,560 --> 01:36:28,201
Well, I knew you had a lot of other offers
and I wanted you to take this one.

1672
01:36:28,360 --> 01:36:30,601
I really wanted to talk to you.

1673
01:36:31,400 --> 01:36:34,404
Well, I'm glad you did.

1674
01:36:34,600 --> 01:36:36,807
I'm glad we had a chance to talk.

1675
01:36:39,360 --> 01:36:40,566
I'm canceling the tour.

1676
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:45,047
Why?

1677
01:36:45,560 --> 01:36:46,641
Because of you.

1678
01:36:48,320 --> 01:36:51,847
I'm never gonna leave you again. Ever.

1679
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:54,571
The best decision I made
was asking you to marry me...

1680
01:36:54,720 --> 01:36:57,007
...and the worst decision I made
was sprinting.

1681
01:36:57,760 --> 01:37:00,411
I plan to make it up to you
as long as it takes.

1682
01:37:02,120 --> 01:37:03,690
Well...

1683
01:37:04,240 --> 01:37:09,406
...you do realize that it could be an awfully
long time before I choose to forgive you.

1684
01:37:09,560 --> 01:37:13,770
I mean, we could be old and gray
before I choose to forgive you.

1685
01:37:14,680 --> 01:37:15,761
I'll Wait.

1686
01:37:18,840 --> 01:37:23,926
It could be years of make-up sex
before I choose to forgive you.

1687
01:37:24,440 --> 01:37:25,441
I'll suffer.

1688
01:37:28,240 --> 01:37:31,130
It's almost midnight.
You wanna go to a party?

1689
01:37:31,480 --> 01:37:36,168
Let's do it! Please welcome
Mayor Bloomberg, ladies and gentlemen!

1690
01:37:38,560 --> 01:37:39,607
Nice to see you, sir.

1691
01:37:39,760 --> 01:37:41,683
- Happy New Year.
- Thank you. Shall we?

1692
01:37:41,840 --> 01:37:44,810
I think it's time. Let's drop the ball.
What do you say?

1693
01:37:45,600 --> 01:37:47,489
Here we go!

1694
01:37:48,480 --> 01:37:51,290
All right, New York City! Are you ready?!

1695
01:37:52,600 --> 01:37:54,284
One minute to go.

1696
01:37:54,440 --> 01:37:57,444
Let's start the countdown
when we hit 10.

1697
01:37:57,640 --> 01:38:00,007
And here comes the ball.

1698
01:38:01,560 --> 01:38:02,721
Uh-huh.

1699
01:38:02,880 --> 01:38:04,291
There it goes.

1700
01:38:04,480 --> 01:38:05,970
Dad, aren't you gonna be cold?

1701
01:38:06,120 --> 01:38:09,488
No, no. There's nothing
like New York air.

1702
01:38:09,840 --> 01:38:11,763
Look, there it goes.

1703
01:38:16,960 --> 01:38:18,962
I made so many mistakes.

1704
01:38:23,160 --> 01:38:25,003
You weren't one of them.

1705
01:38:31,640 --> 01:38:34,211
Okay, folks, let's start the countdown.

1706
01:38:34,360 --> 01:38:36,010
Ten.

1707
01:38:37,320 --> 01:38:39,004
Nine.

1708
01:38:40,160 --> 01:38:41,924
Eight.

1709
01:38:42,920 --> 01:38:44,410
Seven.

1710
01:38:45,720 --> 01:38:47,324
Six.

1711
01:38:48,560 --> 01:38:49,846
Five.

1712
01:38:51,120 --> 01:38:52,690
<i>Four.</i>

1713
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:55,650
Three.

1714
01:38:56,760 --> 01:38:58,330
<i>Two.</i>

1715
01:38:59,480 --> 01:39:00,527
One.

1716
01:39:00,680 --> 01:39:03,047
Happy New Year!

1717
01:39:26,800 --> 01:39:28,086
Wait.

1718
01:39:28,240 --> 01:39:30,208
If you're here, who's at Times Square?

1719
01:39:35,360 --> 01:39:40,446
<i>Should auld acquaintance be forgot</i>

1720
01:39:40,600 --> 01:39:45,561
<i>And never brought to mind?</i>

1721
01:39:45,720 --> 01:39:51,727
<i>Should auld acquaintance be forgot</i>

1722
01:39:51,920 --> 01:39:56,403
<i>And auld lang syne?</i>

1723
01:40:00,240 --> 01:40:05,770
<i>And surely you will buy your cup</i>

1724
01:40:05,920 --> 01:40:10,608
<i>And surely I'll buy mine</i>

1725
01:40:10,760 --> 01:40:14,242
<i>And we'll take a cup of kindness yet</i>

1726
01:40:14,440 --> 01:40:16,329
- You seen Hailey anywhere?
- I haven't.

1727
01:40:16,480 --> 01:40:19,051
I was looking for her and I haven't... Mm.

1728
01:40:19,240 --> 01:40:21,846
<i>For auld lang syne</i>

1729
01:40:22,080 --> 01:40:27,371
<i>We two have run about the slopes</i>

1730
01:40:27,520 --> 01:40:32,970
<i>And picked the daisies fine</i>

1731
01:40:33,120 --> 01:40:38,604
<i>But we've wandered many a weary foot</i>

1732
01:40:38,800 --> 01:40:44,170
<i>Since auld lang syne</i>

1733
01:40:44,320 --> 01:40:49,850
<i>For auld lang syne, my dear</i>

1734
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:55,404
<i>For auld lang syne</i>

1735
01:40:55,560 --> 01:41:00,964
<i>We'll take a cup of kindness yet</i>

1736
01:41:01,120 --> 01:41:06,763
<i>For auld lang syne</i>

1737
01:41:09,920 --> 01:41:12,844
<i>They're calling me now. We have to go.
But I love you so much.</i>

1738
01:41:13,040 --> 01:41:15,168
<i>I think about you all the time.</i>

1739
01:41:15,320 --> 01:41:16,367
I love you.

1740
01:41:18,080 --> 01:41:19,570
I love you so much.

1741
01:41:26,920 --> 01:41:32,529
<i>We two have paddled in the stream</i>

1742
01:41:32,680 --> 01:41:36,890
<i>From morning sun till night</i>

1743
01:41:37,040 --> 01:41:42,922
<i>But the seas between us broad have roared</i>

1744
01:41:43,080 --> 01:41:47,210
<i>From auld lang syne</i>

1745
01:41:48,360 --> 01:41:49,521
<i>For auld lang syne</i>

1746
01:41:49,680 --> 01:41:51,523
What the hell are you doing?

1747
01:41:52,200 --> 01:41:53,531
I'm twice your age!

1748
01:41:54,680 --> 01:41:56,250
Final resolution.

1749
01:41:56,720 --> 01:42:00,691
Midnight kiss on New Year's Eve.
Boom! Check it off.

1750
01:42:00,880 --> 01:42:05,681
<i>We'll take a cup of kindness yet</i>

1751
01:42:05,840 --> 01:42:13,008
<i>For auld lang syne</i>

1752
01:42:28,400 --> 01:42:34,043
<i>Start spreading the news
I'm leaving today</i>

1753
01:42:34,200 --> 01:42:35,565
- I'm fine, Mom.
- You're sure?

1754
01:42:35,720 --> 01:42:36,926
I'm sure.

1755
01:42:37,160 --> 01:42:38,924
You have no idea how worried I was.

1756
01:42:39,080 --> 01:42:40,605
I know, I know. I'm sorry.

1757
01:42:40,760 --> 01:42:43,081
Hailey.
- Hi, Piper.

1758
01:42:43,360 --> 01:42:46,125
- Where have you been?
- You totally freaked us all out.

1759
01:42:46,280 --> 01:42:48,760
We got passes to the after party
at the Hard Rock.

1760
01:42:48,920 --> 01:42:53,244
And Piper's mom, who's been following
us all night, is gonna take us all home.

1761
01:42:56,920 --> 01:43:01,244
Can I go, Mom? Please, please, please.

1762
01:43:01,440 --> 01:43:02,885
- Go. Go. Have fun.
- Really?

1763
01:43:03,040 --> 01:43:05,327
- Yes. Have fun. Yes, really.
- For real? Thank you.

1764
01:43:05,480 --> 01:43:07,323
- Do you wanna come with us?
- No.

1765
01:43:07,480 --> 01:43:09,448
- I'll pass. I'm good.
- Are you sure?

1766
01:43:09,960 --> 01:43:11,485
You should go to your party.

1767
01:43:14,120 --> 01:43:16,771
I love you, Mom. Really.

1768
01:43:17,520 --> 01:43:18,760
I love you too.

1769
01:43:21,120 --> 01:43:22,326
But you're still grounded.

1770
01:43:22,640 --> 01:43:23,846
Yeah, I figured.

1771
01:43:24,920 --> 01:43:27,161
- Okay, bye.
- Bye.

1772
01:43:29,200 --> 01:43:31,806
Happy New Year, bro. Take care.

1773
01:43:31,960 --> 01:43:34,361
All right. Talk to you later, man.

1774
01:43:34,560 --> 01:43:37,404
Text me when you get home
that you got home all right.

1775
01:43:38,560 --> 01:43:41,291
Bye! Happy New Year!

1776
01:43:49,360 --> 01:43:53,365
- Hey, Kim, you came for the party.
- Oh, no, I'm just picking something up.

1777
01:43:54,520 --> 01:43:56,807
Hey. You made it.

1778
01:43:57,000 --> 01:44:01,562
Whatever. You know,
I saw you kissing Lily Bowman.

1779
01:44:01,720 --> 01:44:03,165
Busted.

1780
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:05,843
Can we talk somewhere else?

1781
01:44:10,760 --> 01:44:11,886
Come here.

1782
01:44:13,840 --> 01:44:15,330
Look, I'm...

1783
01:44:15,680 --> 01:44:17,011
Hello.

1784
01:44:17,840 --> 01:44:21,447
I'm telling you the truth. She grabbed me
and she totally stole it from me.

1785
01:44:21,600 --> 01:44:25,605
Oh, she stole it. Oh, okay, yeah.
That makes just perfect sense.

1786
01:44:25,760 --> 01:44:28,366
Well, look, I was just watching
the ball drop and then...

1787
01:44:36,640 --> 01:44:38,005
Whoa.

1788
01:44:38,200 --> 01:44:39,850
Aw...

1789
01:44:42,200 --> 01:44:43,531
Who is that?!

1790
01:45:12,040 --> 01:45:15,169
Would you like to see what we do
on New Year's Eve?

1791
01:45:19,560 --> 01:45:20,721
Welcome to the world.

1792
01:45:40,160 --> 01:45:41,685
- Hi.
- Hey.

1793
01:45:42,760 --> 01:45:44,603
So you had your baby.

1794
01:45:45,160 --> 01:45:46,685
Congratulations.

1795
01:45:47,760 --> 01:45:49,603
- Boy or a girl?
- A boy.

1796
01:45:49,760 --> 01:45:51,171
A boy.

1797
01:45:51,360 --> 01:45:53,647
- You?
- Girl. Third one.

1798
01:45:56,280 --> 01:45:57,645
Exactly at 12:04.

1799
01:46:00,840 --> 01:46:02,126
And yours was when?

1800
01:46:07,400 --> 01:46:08,447
12:05.

1801
01:46:09,360 --> 01:46:10,646
- Really?
- Yeah.

1802
01:46:12,560 --> 01:46:15,803
Thank you. Thanks so much.

1803
01:46:17,360 --> 01:46:19,283
12:05 it is, then.

1804
01:46:38,520 --> 01:46:41,205
- Hey. Happy New Year.
- Happy New Year.

1805
01:46:41,720 --> 01:46:45,850
It's a very good job.
They asked us back for next year.

1806
01:47:16,720 --> 01:47:18,370
You showed up.

1807
01:47:18,840 --> 01:47:20,365
You showed up.

1808
01:47:22,720 --> 01:47:24,165
You look beautiful.

1809
01:47:24,520 --> 01:47:27,683
Well, I had a year to get ready.

1810
01:47:41,760 --> 01:47:46,129
<i>- Sometimes it feels like there are so</i>

1811
01:47:46,280 --> 01:47:50,285
<i>Earthquakes, floods, reality shows.</i>

1812
01:47:50,480 --> 01:47:53,723
<i>But it's important to remember
the things that we can...</i>

1813
01:47:53,880 --> 01:47:58,807
<i>...like forgiveness, second chances,
fresh starts.</i>

1814
01:47:59,040 --> 01:48:03,523
<i>Because the one thing that turns the world
from a lonely place to a beautiful place...</i>

1815
01:48:03,680 --> 01:48:05,409
<i>...is love.</i>

1816
01:48:05,560 --> 01:48:08,245
<i>Love in any of its forms.</i>

1817
01:48:08,400 --> 01:48:10,243
<i>Love gives us hope.</i>

1818
01:48:10,400 --> 01:48:12,402
<i>Hope for the new year.</i>

1819
01:48:15,400 --> 01:48:16,561
<i>Hope...</i>

1820
01:48:16,760 --> 01:48:18,603
<i>...and a great party.</i>

1821
01:48:58,280 --> 01:49:01,682
Don't just dump them!
It should be magical!

1822
01:49:01,960 --> 01:49:03,803
Take one.

1823
01:49:14,560 --> 01:49:16,688
I've been plotting that slap for years.

1824
01:49:16,840 --> 01:49:21,050
How I would just walk up to you
out of the blue... Shit.

1825
01:49:32,520 --> 01:49:34,010
I wouldn't want you to be my doctor.

1826
01:49:51,280 --> 01:49:52,327
You think we should...

1827
01:49:54,280 --> 01:49:57,011
You think we should move him
to hospice?

1828
01:49:57,160 --> 01:50:00,448
- Why did you do that to me?
- It's okay, Nurse Aimee.

1829
01:50:04,080 --> 01:50:06,048
- Good one.
- Yeah, good one.

1830
01:50:06,240 --> 01:50:07,366
Cut, cut, cut.

1831
01:50:07,520 --> 01:50:10,842
I... up. I didn't tell her
in the middle of her sentence.

1832
01:50:11,040 --> 01:50:12,724
Go to mark.

1833
01:50:20,920 --> 01:50:22,888
Oh, hey. Hold the elevator.

1834
01:50:24,720 --> 01:50:26,882
Baby, things were just heating up!

1835
01:50:36,680 --> 01:50:39,126
Oh. Mrs. Baxter.

1836
01:50:39,360 --> 01:50:40,646
I mean, Mrs....

1837
01:50:40,840 --> 01:50:42,729
What's your name? Ms. Withers.

1838
01:50:42,880 --> 01:50:47,522
It's midnight. We have to do something
tonight. Get over yourself. Shi... Uh-uh.

1839
01:50:48,400 --> 01:50:51,210
Ooh. Sorry, you're a little late.

1840
01:51:20,440 --> 01:51:23,603
He was in this morning.
He didn't leave orders, and...

1841
01:51:25,640 --> 01:51:29,884
And I may not allow him
in my unit any more.

1842
01:51:43,040 --> 01:51:45,281
Something coming.

1843
01:51:45,440 --> 01:51:47,920
Oh, something coming.

1844
01:51:48,320 --> 01:51:49,810
Oh.

1845
01:51:50,120 --> 01:51:51,645
Oh, what do we have here?

1846
01:51:52,120 --> 01:51:54,122
- I think we have twins.
- Oh, my God!

1847
01:51:54,280 --> 01:51:56,681
Oh, you are a goddess.

1848
01:52:29,320 --> 01:52:31,004
That is a wrap!

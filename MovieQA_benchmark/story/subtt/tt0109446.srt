P.D. that he and his younger brother...

and then ran and called the cops.

were all over the car, inside and out.

before Clifford shot himself.

-One, he's scared.

Adults are the enemy.

and give you a statement in writing?

-Uh, we need to talk to this child, Reggie.

We have a set of confirmed fingerprints
that put him inside Jerome Clifford's car.

at the hospital.

And did you ask either Mark Sway
or his mother before doing so?

of an 11-year-old child?

So his prints are inside the car.

You have absolutely no proof
that he even interacted with Clifford.

840
00:50:47,712 --> 00:50:49,963
Kid has a bruise on his left cheekbone.

841
00:50:50,131 --> 00:50:52,799
We found a spot of blood on Clifford's ring,
not his type.

842

Mark Sway's blood type?

Mark Sway's blood type?

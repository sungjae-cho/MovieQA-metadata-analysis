00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:09,227
(drumroll)

00:00:09,327 --> 00:00:12,578
(rousing orchestral
fanfare playing)

3
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:23,112
(fanfare ends)

4
00:00:35,747 --> 00:00:39,376
# Well, the healing has begun #

5
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:50,165
# I want you to put on
your pretty summer dress, yeah #

6
00:00:50,265 --> 00:00:51,814
# You can wear
your Easter clothes #

# Sunday bonnet

00:01:02,132 --> 00:01:05,093
# Well, the healing

00:01:51,213 --> 00:01:53,977
# Oh, yeah, la-la #

00:01:57,013 --> 00:01:59,982
# Hmm-mm... #

26
00:02:02,246 --> 00:02:03,913
- Hold that will you?
- Yeah.

27
00:02:04,013 --> 00:02:06,013
Thanks.

28
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:19,610
(breathing heavily)

29
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,480
Anton, fucking hell, man.

30
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:30,814
- Come on, give me that.

31
00:02:30,914 --> 00:02:32,647
Give me the case.

32
00:02:32,747 --> 00:02:34,246
What are you fucking at, man?

33
00:02:34,346 --> 00:02:37,298
For fuck's sake.

34
00:02:37,398 --> 00:02:39,146

35
00:02:39,246 --> 00:02:40,513

00:02:45,747 --> 00:02:48,647
- Oh, fuck.

39
00:02:48,747 --> 00:02:50,680
I'm just dying

40
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:53,442
Look, there's 20 cent.
Look it.

41
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:56,913
Look, don't fucking rob me.

42
00:02:57,013 --> 00:02:59,346

00:02:59,446 --> 00:03:01,847

00:03:03,313 --> 00:03:05,280

00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:07,046
You want money, just fucking,
just ask me for it.

47
00:03:07,146 --> 00:03:09,480
Don't have me chase you all
the way up the street for it.

48
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:13,897
Want to give us that
fiver then, do ya?

49
00:03:13,997 --> 00:03:18,162
Oh, for fuck's sake.
Here.

50
00:03:18,262 --> 00:03:19,714
How's your ma?

51
00:03:19,814 --> 00:03:21,797
She's dead, man.

52
00:03:21,897 --> 00:03:23,046
Well, how's your old fella?

53
00:03:23,146 --> 00:03:25,659
Fair play to ya, right?

54
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:27,847

55
00:03:27,947 --> 00:03:29,647
Look, there's two euros, look.

56
00:03:29,747 --> 00:03:31,046
Fair play to ya, right?

57
00:03:31,146 --> 00:03:33,150
See you, good luck, man.

58
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:37,650
(acoustic guitar playing)

59
00:03:58,413 --> 00:04:01,905
# Scratching
at the surface now #

60
00:04:04,513 --> 00:04:08,711
# And I'm trying hard
to work it out #

61
00:04:11,446 --> 00:04:15,940
# And so much has gone
misunderstood #

62
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:22,976
# And this mystery
only leads to doubt #

63
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:29,245
# And I didn't understand #

64
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:36,208
# When you reached out
to take my hand #

65
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:43,180
# And if you have
something to say#

66
00:04:46,146 --> 00:04:49,497
# You'd better say it now #

67
00:04:49,597 --> 00:04:53,448
# 'Cause this is
what you've waited for#

68
00:04:56,213 --> 00:05:00,013
# Your chance to even up
the score #

69
00:05:03,013 --> 00:05:06,459
# And as these shadows fall #

70
00:05:06,559 --> 00:05:12,264
# On me now I'll win somehow #

71
00:05:12,364 --> 00:05:14,764
# Yeah #

72
00:05:14,864 --> 00:05:21,829
# 'Cause I'm picking up
a message, Lord #

73
00:05:21,929 --> 00:05:28,395
# That I'm closer
than I've ever been before #

74
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:32,629
# So if you have something
to say #

75
00:05:32,729 --> 00:05:35,443
# Say it to me now#

76
00:05:38,847 --> 00:05:43,011
# Just say it to me now, now #

77
00:05:45,547 --> 00:05:50,331
# Oh, oh #

78
00:05:50,431 --> 00:05:53,426
# 0h #

79
00:05:53,526 --> 00:05:55,513
# 0h. #

80
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:08,180
(muffled clapping)

81
00:06:10,446 --> 00:06:11,847
Thanks.

82
00:06:11,947 --> 00:06:14,662
Ten cents
brilliant. Thanks.

83
00:06:14,762 --> 00:06:16,480
Excuse me?

84
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:18,673
Sorry.

85
00:06:20,346 --> 00:06:21,647
<i>Big Issue?</i>

86
00:06:21,747 --> 00:06:24,063
Can't afford it.

87
00:06:24,163 --> 00:06:27,626
This song you just play,
you write it?

88
00:06:27,726 --> 00:06:29,280
Working on it.

89
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:31,180
It's not an established song?

90
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,547
No, it's not an
established song.

91
00:06:33,647 --> 00:06:34,880
How come you don't play it

92
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:36,013
during daytime?

93
00:06:36,113 --> 00:06:37,513
I see you every day.

94
00:06:37,613 --> 00:06:40,513
You know, during the day, people
want to hear songs they know,

95
00:06:40,613 --> 00:06:42,046
just songs that they recognize.

96
00:06:42,146 --> 00:06:43,647
I mean, otherwise,
I wouldn't make any money.

97
00:06:43,747 --> 00:06:45,480
I play these songs at night.
They wouldn't listen.

98
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:47,530
I listen.

99
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:50,329
Yeah, but you gave me ten cents.

100
00:06:50,429 --> 00:06:52,594
You do it
for money then?

101
00:06:52,694 --> 00:06:53,979
Why don't you
get a job

102
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:55,213
in a shop?

103
00:06:55,313 --> 00:06:58,326
I have a job in a shop.

104
00:06:58,426 --> 00:07:00,513
Listen, I'm going to get
back to this, yeah?

105
00:07:00,613 --> 00:07:01,714
Nice to meet you.

106
00:07:01,814 --> 00:07:04,046
Who'd you write that song
for, please?

107
00:07:04,146 --> 00:07:06,580
No one.

108
00:07:10,413 --> 00:07:12,960
Bullshit.

109
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:14,480
Where is she?

110
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:17,964
She's gone.

111
00:07:18,064 --> 00:07:19,880
She's dead?

112
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:23,330
No, she's not dead, she's gone.

113
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:25,113
You love her still?

114
00:07:25,213 --> 00:07:27,340
Jesus, man.

115
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:30,847
(inaudible)

116
00:07:30,947 --> 00:07:33,662
You're over her.

117
00:07:33,762 --> 00:07:34,880
Rubbish.

118
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:37,013
No one who would write
this song is over her.

119
00:07:37,113 --> 00:07:38,713
I'm telling you.

120
00:07:38,813 --> 00:07:41,613
You play this marvelous song
to her, you get her back.

121
00:07:41,713 --> 00:07:43,680
I don't want her back.

122
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:46,564
I see.

123
00:07:46,664 --> 00:07:49,531
What shop you work in?

124
00:07:49,631 --> 00:07:51,447
I work in a Hoover repair shop.

125
00:07:51,547 --> 00:07:52,780
A Hoover?

126
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:55,447
You know, like a vacuum cleaner.
Whhzzz.

127
00:07:55,547 --> 00:07:57,694
You fix vacuum cleaners?

128
00:07:57,794 --> 00:07:58,814
I do.

129
00:07:58,914 --> 00:08:01,832
I have a broken vacuum cleaner.

130
00:08:01,932 --> 00:08:03,613
- You fix it for me?
- Yeah.

131
00:08:03,713 --> 00:08:05,380
I bring it tomorrow then?

132
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,313
Okay.

133
00:08:06,413 --> 00:08:07,346
This is great.

134
00:08:07,446 --> 00:08:08,346
Tomorrow?

135
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:09,380
Right.

136
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,313
- Okay, bye.
- Good luck.

137
00:08:11,413 --> 00:08:13,847
(strumming guitar)

138
00:08:14,046 --> 00:08:22,096
# You have broken me
all the way down #

139
00:08:22,196 --> 00:08:26,583
# Down upon my knees #

140
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:36,364
# And you have broken me
all the way now #

141
00:08:36,464 --> 00:08:40,061
(music continues)

142
00:08:40,161 --> 00:08:42,146
(phone ringing)

143
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:45,495
Hi. This is Catherine.

144
00:08:45,595 --> 00:08:48,980
Leave a message
and I'll get back to you.

145
00:09:04,713 --> 00:09:11,566
# I'll be far to sea #

146
00:09:11,666 --> 00:09:14,912
(music continues)

147
00:09:18,613 --> 00:09:20,080
That job's ready
for collection now, Dad.

148
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:21,814
Okay, son.

149
00:09:21,914 --> 00:09:24,294
I'm going to head into town.

150
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,285
Should I turn this
around for you?

151
00:09:30,613 --> 00:09:31,714
What'll I get for dinner?

152
00:09:31,814 --> 00:09:33,814
The fish, maybe.

153
00:09:41,013 --> 00:09:46,883
(music continues)

154
00:09:59,446 --> 00:10:00,380
Hello.

155
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,513
How are you? How's it going?

156
00:10:02,613 --> 00:10:04,013
I bring you my Hoover.

157
00:10:04,113 --> 00:10:06,274
(fades)

158
00:10:08,346 --> 00:10:10,313
All right.

159
00:10:10,413 --> 00:10:12,330
What's wrong with it?

160
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:14,363
It is fucked.

161
00:10:14,463 --> 00:10:16,213
It doesn't suck up
the dirt.

162
00:10:16,313 --> 00:10:17,780
Well, listen, there's
nothing I can do,

163
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,680
I don't have any of my
tools or nothing with me.

164
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:21,213
I'm going on me break now.

165
00:10:21,313 --> 00:10:22,946
Can you bring it in
tomorrow or something?

166
00:10:23,046 --> 00:10:25,046
Well, no, I bring it today.

167
00:10:25,146 --> 00:10:27,297
- You, you...
- Yeah, but there's nothing

168
00:10:27,397 --> 00:10:28,613
I can do with it, love,

169
00:10:28,713 --> 00:10:29,814
I don't have
me tools, or...

170
00:10:29,914 --> 00:10:31,647
It's like I have
to bring it home.

171
00:10:31,747 --> 00:10:35,997
If I come on break, you have
a look at it at least?

172
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,946
Yeah, but you
don't understand.

173
00:10:38,046 --> 00:10:39,547
I come with you, then?

174
00:10:39,647 --> 00:10:42,098
For lunch?

175
00:10:42,198 --> 00:10:43,146
Yeah, all right.

176
00:10:43,246 --> 00:10:44,613
- Yes, we go together?
- Yeah.

177
00:10:44,713 --> 00:10:46,380
Okay.

178
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,493
Thank you.

179
00:10:48,593 --> 00:10:51,385
- You hungry?
- I'm always hungry.

180
00:10:59,413 --> 00:11:03,975
So you know a bit
about music then?

181
00:11:06,246 --> 00:11:09,080
My father used to play in
the orchestra back at home.

182
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:11,774
He played violin.

183
00:11:13,814 --> 00:11:16,547
But he got arthritis then,
and he killed himself.

184
00:11:16,647 --> 00:11:17,979
Really?

185
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:21,780
But before he go, he teach me
how to play piano.

186
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:24,180
"It's not so hard
on the fingers" he said.

187
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:27,327
Do you get to play much?

188
00:11:27,427 --> 00:11:30,513
Hmm. No, I don't, I don't
have a piano at home.

189
00:11:30,613 --> 00:11:32,613
I can't get one in Ireland;
it's so much money.

190
00:11:32,713 --> 00:11:34,713
I can't afford it.

191
00:11:35,947 --> 00:11:38,497
Yeah, it's expensive
all right.

192
00:11:46,813 --> 00:11:48,380
I play in a
piano shop.

193
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,847
This man lets me play-

194
00:11:49,947 --> 00:11:52,196
one hour per day
at lunch.

195
00:11:52,296 --> 00:11:54,861
Somewhere around here?

196
00:11:54,961 --> 00:11:56,213
You want to
hear me play?

197
00:11:56,313 --> 00:11:58,263
- Yeah.
- Now?

198
00:11:58,363 --> 00:11:59,246
Yeah.

199
00:11:59,346 --> 00:12:01,576
Okay.

200
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:04,647
(knocking)

201
00:12:04,747 --> 00:12:06,747
Can we come in?

202
00:12:09,079 --> 00:12:11,079
(buzzer)

203
00:12:15,547 --> 00:12:17,447
This is the man
I was telling you about.

204
00:12:17,547 --> 00:12:18,647
He's a real gentleman.

205
00:12:18,747 --> 00:12:19,647
Hi.

206
00:12:19,747 --> 00:12:20,913
Okay for me
to play today?

207
00:12:21,013 --> 00:12:22,113
Yeah, that's fine.

208
00:12:22,213 --> 00:12:23,313
Thanks.

209
00:12:23,413 --> 00:12:25,780
Not the baby Yamaha
though. She's sold.

210
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,880
- Okie-dokie.
- Mm-hmm.

211
00:12:33,547 --> 00:12:35,547
Now, which one today?

212
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:39,581
(classical)

213
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:19,447
# #

214
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:51,714
That kind of thing.

215
00:13:51,814 --> 00:13:54,062
(exhales)

216
00:13:54,162 --> 00:13:56,395
It's amazing.

217
00:13:56,495 --> 00:13:57,447
Did you write that?

218
00:13:57,547 --> 00:14:00,397
No, no, Mendelssohn did.

219
00:14:00,497 --> 00:14:01,513
It's good.

220
00:14:01,613 --> 00:14:03,672
It's good, yes.

221
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,847
Play me another
of your songs.

222
00:14:05,947 --> 00:14:06,847
No.

223
00:14:06,947 --> 00:14:07,847
Please.

224
00:14:07,947 --> 00:14:08,880
Not here.

225
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:10,647
Why? Here, Billy
doesn't mind.

226
00:14:10,747 --> 00:14:14,147
- You think it would be all right?
- Yes.

227
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:16,713
Okay.

228
00:14:16,813 --> 00:14:18,313
Let's put that there, yeah?

229
00:14:18,413 --> 00:14:20,413
Mm-hmm.

230
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,547
This is in C, yeah?

231
00:14:23,647 --> 00:14:25,647
Yeah, okay,
I can see that.

232
00:14:25,747 --> 00:14:27,697
Okay.

233
00:14:27,797 --> 00:14:29,995
So, it goes, um...

234
00:14:30,095 --> 00:14:34,329
Da... It goes,
# Da-da-da-da #

235
00:14:34,429 --> 00:14:41,766
# Da-da-da-da,
da-da-da-da-da #

236
00:14:41,866 --> 00:14:43,513
Yeah? And then there's
a bit in there-

237
00:14:43,613 --> 00:14:45,613
Can you do that?

238
00:14:46,747 --> 00:14:53,330
# Da-da-da-da-da... #

239
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:54,513
Brilliant.

240
00:14:54,613 --> 00:14:56,313
And then there's another
part that goes, uh...

241
00:14:56,413 --> 00:14:59,859
# Ba-ba-pa-pa-pa #

242
00:14:59,959 --> 00:15:03,927
# Ba-ba-pa-pa-pa #

243
00:15:04,027 --> 00:15:07,797
# Ba-ba-pa-pa-pa #

244
00:15:07,897 --> 00:15:09,979
Yeah? And then the
chorus, let's see.

245
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:11,246
- You have those two bits?
- Mm-hmm.

246
00:15:11,346 --> 00:15:12,447
And the chorus goes...

247
00:15:12,547 --> 00:15:16,662
# Da-da-da-da-da

248
00:15:16,762 --> 00:15:23,633
# Pa-pa-pa-pa, pa-pa-pa #

249
00:15:23,733 --> 00:15:30,532
# Ba-ba... da-da. #

250
00:15:30,632 --> 00:15:32,046
That's it. Perfect. Brilliant.

251
00:15:32,146 --> 00:15:33,913
So, do you want
to give it a spin?

252
00:15:34,013 --> 00:15:37,459
- Yes, try it.
- Okay.

253
00:15:37,559 --> 00:15:39,313
Two, three,

254
00:15:39,413 --> 00:15:41,413
four.

255
00:15:55,013 --> 00:16:02,198
# I don't know you,
but I want you #

256
00:16:02,298 --> 00:16:09,728
# All the more for that #

257
00:16:09,828 --> 00:16:17,166
# And words fall through me
and always fool me #

258
00:16:17,266 --> 00:16:22,694
# And I can't react #

259
00:16:22,794 --> 00:16:24,860
We change here.

260
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:33,199
# And games that never amount
to more than they're meant #

261
00:16:33,299 --> 00:16:38,396
# Will play themselves out #

262
00:16:38,496 --> 00:16:39,714
Hold it.

263
00:16:39,814 --> 00:16:41,814
And the chorus.

264
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:51,398
# Take this sinking boat
and point it home #

265
00:16:51,498 --> 00:16:57,529
# We've still got time #

266
00:16:57,629 --> 00:17:02,330
# Raise your hopeful voice #

267
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:05,595
# You had the choice #

268
00:17:05,695 --> 00:17:13,143
# You've made it now #

269
00:17:16,146 --> 00:17:23,628
# Falling slowly,
eyes that know me #

270
00:17:23,728 --> 00:17:27,877
# And I can't go back #

271
00:17:31,079 --> 00:17:38,663
# Moods that take me
and erase me #

272
00:17:38,763 --> 00:17:45,998
# And I'm painted black#

273
00:17:46,098 --> 00:17:54,664
# Well, you have suffered enough
and warred with yourself #

274
00:17:54,764 --> 00:17:59,207
# It's time that you won #

275
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:03,480
Again.

276
00:18:04,647 --> 00:18:12,899
# Take this sinking boat
and point it home #

277
00:18:12,999 --> 00:18:19,265
# We've still got time #

278
00:18:19,365 --> 00:18:24,029
# Raise your hopeful voice #

279
00:18:24,129 --> 00:18:27,261
# You had the choice #

280
00:18:27,361 --> 00:18:34,650
# You've made it now #

281
00:18:40,346 --> 00:18:45,682
# Uh-huh, uh-huh,
uh-huh... #

282
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:51,046
# Yeah #

283
00:18:51,146 --> 00:18:59,264
# Take this sinking boat
and point it home #

284
00:18:59,364 --> 00:19:05,665
# We've still got time #

285
00:19:05,765 --> 00:19:10,194
# Raise your hopeful voice #

286
00:19:10,294 --> 00:19:19,999
# You had the choice,
you've made it now #

287
00:19:20,099 --> 00:19:27,994
# Falling slowly,
sing your melody #

288
00:19:28,094 --> 00:19:34,985
# I'll sing along... #

289
00:19:39,747 --> 00:19:46,084
(vocalizing)

290
00:19:50,413 --> 00:19:53,562
# Ah, ah... #

291
00:19:53,662 --> 00:19:57,863
# #

292
00:19:57,963 --> 00:20:00,412
# Call and I'll sing along. #

293
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,847
I moved back in
about a year ago,

294
00:20:32,947 --> 00:20:37,282
after me ma died, just to
help me dad out, you know.

295
00:20:38,947 --> 00:20:40,680
So tell me about her.

296
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:42,647
Who, me ma?

297
00:20:42,747 --> 00:20:47,666
No, the girl, the special girl
you write these songs for.

298
00:20:47,766 --> 00:20:48,979
No.

299
00:20:49,079 --> 00:20:51,328
Come on.

300
00:20:51,428 --> 00:20:53,413
What did she do to you?

301
00:20:56,413 --> 00:20:59,994
Well.

302
00:21:00,094 --> 00:21:08,264
# Ten years ago, I fell in
love with an Irish girl #

303
00:21:08,364 --> 00:21:11,264
# She took my heart #

304
00:21:11,364 --> 00:21:16,928
# But she went and screwed
some guy that she knew #

305
00:21:17,028 --> 00:21:21,932
# And now I'm in Dublin
with a broken heart #

306
00:21:22,032 --> 00:21:27,263
# Oh, broken-hearted
Hoover-fixer sucker guy#

307
00:21:27,363 --> 00:21:31,596
# Oh, broken-hearted
Hoover-fixer sucker... #

308
00:21:31,696 --> 00:21:35,261
# Sucker guy #

309
00:21:35,361 --> 00:21:39,529
# One day, I'll go there
and win her once again #

310
00:21:39,629 --> 00:21:46,027
# But until then, I'm just
a sucker of a guy. #

311
00:21:46,127 --> 00:21:48,707
(laughing)

312
00:21:52,547 --> 00:21:55,864
So she's with him now?

313
00:21:55,964 --> 00:21:56,913
- No.
- Don't know.

314
00:21:57,013 --> 00:21:59,013
Where is she?

315
00:21:59,647 --> 00:22:03,947
# She's in old London town #

316
00:22:06,814 --> 00:22:10,910
# Living somewhere
around Chiswick. #

317
00:22:13,947 --> 00:22:17,781
I miss her.
It's just sort of... you know.

318
00:22:19,613 --> 00:22:22,163
You're not going
to go get her?

319
00:22:22,947 --> 00:22:24,013
No?

320
00:22:24,113 --> 00:22:27,344
No. Fuck her.

321
00:22:27,914 --> 00:22:29,280
# Fuck her,
fuck her. #

322
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:30,780
# Fuck her, she's gone #

323
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:33,798
# Fuck her, she's gone forever#

324
00:22:33,898 --> 00:22:35,513
# She fucking fucked it up!... #

325
00:22:35,613 --> 00:22:37,113
- (woman speaks indistinctly)
- Sorry.

326
00:22:37,213 --> 00:22:38,213
Sorry.

327
00:22:38,313 --> 00:22:41,394
(softly):
# Fucking fucked it up #

328
00:22:41,494 --> 00:22:44,460
# She fucking fucked it up! #

329
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:46,680
# And now she's gonna die. #

330
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:48,780
(playing guitar chords)

331
00:22:54,713 --> 00:22:56,861
(radio playing)

332
00:22:56,961 --> 00:22:59,837
Give us the sharp eight
there, son.

333
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,993
And the Phillips.

334
00:23:07,093 --> 00:23:09,079
Come on.

335
00:23:11,213 --> 00:23:13,713
Your son
is a very talented man, sir.

336
00:23:13,813 --> 00:23:16,513
Well, he should be.
I trained him meself.

337
00:23:16,613 --> 00:23:18,313
Oh, no. I meant the songs.

338
00:23:18,413 --> 00:23:20,460
Oh, right. Is he?

339
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:22,280
- Very.
- Okay, that's done.

340
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:24,280
You can take it back
with you.

341
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:26,480
It was just the belt,
so it should be all right now.

342
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:28,447
Thank you.
How much do I owe you?

343
00:23:28,547 --> 00:23:29,979
Oh, you're fine there;
it's free.

344
00:23:30,079 --> 00:23:32,459
Nothing's for free.
How much?

345
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:36,280
Say four euro, love.

346
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:41,580
Okay. We're going
to head upstairs, Dad.

347
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:43,814
Is there anything
else you need?

348
00:23:43,914 --> 00:23:45,180
No, I'm grand.

349
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:46,547
Okay.

350
00:23:46,647 --> 00:23:48,513
A pleasure to meet you, sir.

351
00:23:48,613 --> 00:23:50,246
And you.

352
00:23:50,346 --> 00:23:51,513
Take care.

353
00:23:51,613 --> 00:23:53,613
Good.

354
00:24:01,813 --> 00:24:03,813
Come on in.

355
00:24:10,113 --> 00:24:12,113
There you are.

356
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:18,873
(music playing on tape)

357
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:31,230
(music stops)

358
00:24:31,330 --> 00:24:32,814
Wow.

359
00:24:32,914 --> 00:24:36,413
Can you transfer this stuff on to
disc for me so I can listen?

360
00:24:36,513 --> 00:24:38,497
Yeah.

361
00:24:38,597 --> 00:24:39,814
I have to go now.

362
00:24:39,914 --> 00:24:42,994
Do you want to stay?

363
00:24:43,094 --> 00:24:45,159
What do you mean?

364
00:24:45,259 --> 00:24:47,394
Stay the night?

365
00:24:47,494 --> 00:24:49,778
What?

366
00:24:53,213 --> 00:24:54,780
Fuck this.

367
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,513
Thanks for the Hoover, yeah?

368
00:24:56,613 --> 00:24:58,908
- See you.
- See you around.

369
00:25:02,413 --> 00:25:04,413
Fuck.

370
00:25:07,313 --> 00:25:10,111
Flowers? Flowers?

371
00:25:16,246 --> 00:25:18,046
- Hey.
- Hey.

372
00:25:18,146 --> 00:25:20,159
How's it going?

373
00:25:20,259 --> 00:25:21,913
Hey, where you going?

374
00:25:22,013 --> 00:25:26,093
I wanted to give you the CDs
that I made for you.

375
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:28,613
I'm really...
I'm just really lonely,

376
00:25:28,713 --> 00:25:30,313
and you're gorgeous,
and I just...

377
00:25:30,413 --> 00:25:32,347
I'm sorry. I fucked up.
I'm sorry. I...

378
00:25:32,447 --> 00:25:35,128
I don't know what to say.

379
00:25:35,228 --> 00:25:37,213
It won't happen again.

380
00:25:43,213 --> 00:25:45,146
Do you have a CD player?

381
00:25:45,246 --> 00:25:46,847
Yeah.

382
00:25:46,947 --> 00:25:49,494
Here you go.

383
00:25:49,594 --> 00:25:52,647
Batteries are pretty low,
but it should work.

384
00:25:52,747 --> 00:25:54,714
I give it back.

385
00:25:54,814 --> 00:25:56,347
No problem. Keep it.

386
00:25:56,447 --> 00:25:58,993
I have to go now.

387
00:25:59,093 --> 00:26:00,680
I'll talk
to you later.

388
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:02,979
You don't want to get a cup of
tea or something? I'd love to...

389
00:26:03,079 --> 00:26:04,680
just talk to you
a bit more.

390
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:07,180
I have responsibilities.
I have to go home.

391
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:09,713
Is it okay to walk along
with you then?

392
00:26:09,813 --> 00:26:11,146
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

393
00:26:11,246 --> 00:26:13,647
Cool. Cool.
So how was it today?

394
00:26:13,747 --> 00:26:15,827
Selling good.

395
00:26:15,927 --> 00:26:17,680
And today is a really good day
for me

396
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:21,564
because I got a job
in a big house, cleaning.

397
00:26:21,664 --> 00:26:25,213
This lady is going to pay me
some money, so I'm very happy.

398
00:26:25,313 --> 00:26:27,948
That's brilliant.
I'm delighted.

399
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:39,047
This is where I live.

400
00:26:39,147 --> 00:26:42,396
Oh, yeah? Cool.

401
00:26:42,496 --> 00:26:44,313
All right, then.

402
00:26:44,413 --> 00:26:46,013
Do you want to come in?

403
00:26:46,113 --> 00:26:50,296
Can I? Yeah. Cool.

404
00:26:50,396 --> 00:26:51,913
Hi, guys.

405
00:26:52,013 --> 00:26:53,046
Hello.

406
00:26:53,146 --> 00:26:54,046
How are you today?

407
00:26:54,146 --> 00:26:55,213
Not bad, not bad.

413
00:27:39,146 --> 00:27:40,613
Ah, hi.

415
00:27:42,961 --> 00:27:44,814
This is my friend.
This is my mother.

417
00:27:47,093 --> 00:27:49,046
Nice to meet you.
How's it going?

418
00:27:49,146 --> 00:27:52,694
(speaking Czech)

419
00:27:52,794 --> 00:27:56,530
This is my
daughter Ivonka.

420
00:27:56,630 --> 00:27:59,295
Come on.

421
00:27:59,395 --> 00:28:01,610
Hello, Ivonka. Hello.

00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:13,830
(speaking Czech)

424
00:28:13,930 --> 00:28:15,864
Sorry?

425
00:28:15,964 --> 00:28:18,413
That's dinner. Do you
want to stay for dinner?

426
00:28:18,513 --> 00:28:20,513
Yeah. Thank you.

427
00:28:32,313 --> 00:28:33,713
Want to sit down?

428
00:28:33,813 --> 00:28:34,979
Yeah.

429
00:28:35,079 --> 00:28:37,079
MOTHER:

430
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:41,945

(speaking Czech)

434
00:28:59,513 --> 00:29:01,313
Well, what did she say?

435
00:29:01,413 --> 00:29:02,979
She says you're handsome.

436
00:29:03,079 --> 00:29:04,313
She what?

437
00:29:04,413 --> 00:29:05,979
Says you're handsome.

438
00:29:06,079 --> 00:29:07,480
How do I say thanks?

439
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:08,380
(speaks Czech word)

440
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:11,094
(speaks Czech word)

441
00:29:11,194 --> 00:29:12,246
(speaks Czech)

442
00:29:12,346 --> 00:29:13,713
Says, "You're welcome."

443
00:29:13,813 --> 00:29:15,480
Cool. Thanks.

444
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:16,847
Ty to speak a little English, Mama.

445
00:29:16,947 --> 00:29:18,947
No, thank you.

446
00:29:20,413 --> 00:29:21,946
Careful.

447
00:29:22,046 --> 00:29:23,413
Careful, Ivonka.
Don't do that.

448
00:29:23,513 --> 00:29:25,553
She's grand.
She's grand.

449
00:29:27,446 --> 00:29:28,913
Where's her dad?

450
00:29:29,013 --> 00:29:31,492
He doesn't live here.

451
00:29:31,592 --> 00:29:34,174
Why not?

452
00:29:35,947 --> 00:29:37,947
He's at home.

453
00:29:44,814 --> 00:29:46,764
Hello. Hi.

454
00:29:46,864 --> 00:29:48,213
These are
from next door.

455
00:29:48,313 --> 00:29:50,578
They come in
to watch telly.

456
00:29:50,678 --> 00:29:52,413
- Yeah.
- Hi, guys.

457
00:29:52,513 --> 00:29:53,979
There's only one
telly in the building.

458
00:29:54,079 --> 00:29:55,680
<i>We watch Fair City together.</i>

459
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:57,380
<i>Fair City, we love.<i/></i>

460
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:00,229
<i>We learn English
from Fair City.</i>

461
00:30:00,329 --> 00:30:02,046
Are you not pregnant?

462
00:30:02,146 --> 00:30:03,680
(laughing)

463
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:06,231
How are you, man?

464
00:30:06,331 --> 00:30:08,338
What is the hurry?

465
00:30:20,346 --> 00:30:22,046
Just put her in there.

466
00:30:22,146 --> 00:30:24,146
Okay.

467
00:30:25,213 --> 00:30:27,213
There you go, dearie.

468
00:30:30,747 --> 00:30:31,979
Okay.

469
00:30:32,079 --> 00:30:34,079
She likes you.

470
00:30:51,046 --> 00:30:53,981
(music playing on CD)

471
00:31:07,346 --> 00:31:10,393
You have no lyrics
for this one?

472
00:31:10,493 --> 00:31:12,880
It's really good.
I like it.

473
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:18,025
I've got a few,
but they're not right.

474
00:31:18,813 --> 00:31:20,813
Huh?

475
00:31:22,013 --> 00:31:25,431
I've got a few,
but they're not right.

476
00:31:25,531 --> 00:31:27,992
What? Do you like it?

477
00:31:28,092 --> 00:31:29,313
It's great.

478
00:31:29,413 --> 00:31:33,246
Would you be into trying...
trying to write lyrics for it?

479
00:31:33,346 --> 00:31:35,013
Really? I could?

480
00:31:35,113 --> 00:31:36,480
Yeah. It's just
like that idea?

481
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:38,313
- Yeah.
- Cool. Cool.

482
00:31:38,413 --> 00:31:39,513
That would be good.

483
00:31:39,613 --> 00:31:41,280
I can keep machine
and write it?

484
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:43,613
Yeah. Do. I was having
a bit of trouble with it.

485
00:31:43,713 --> 00:31:45,680
It's too romantic for me.

486
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:47,313
It is romantic.

487
00:31:47,413 --> 00:31:49,213
You have a
romantic streak.

488
00:31:49,313 --> 00:31:52,360
I used to have
a romantic streak.

489
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:54,446
When?

490
00:31:55,513 --> 00:31:58,228
When I was your age,
I suppose.

491
00:31:58,328 --> 00:32:00,213
I see. You're
an old man now.

492
00:32:00,313 --> 00:32:02,313
Yeah. Dying.

493
00:32:04,046 --> 00:32:06,046
Cynical.

494
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:11,847
You have to go now.

495
00:32:11,947 --> 00:32:14,547
Thanks for the Hoover
and food and songs.

496
00:32:14,647 --> 00:32:16,647
No problem.

497
00:32:20,647 --> 00:32:22,614
Thanks for the company.

498
00:32:22,714 --> 00:32:24,246
I needed it.

499
00:32:24,346 --> 00:32:26,346
Me, too.

500
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:30,280
You don't want
to go for late coffee

501
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:31,946
or a walk or something? No?

502
00:32:32,046 --> 00:32:33,713
I can't. See you.

503
00:32:33,813 --> 00:32:35,313
Bye.

504
00:32:35,413 --> 00:32:37,413
See you.

505
00:32:56,146 --> 00:32:58,280
(music playing over earphones)

506
00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:02,529
(humming)

507
00:33:02,629 --> 00:33:04,380
(music playing)

508
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:06,480
(music stops)

509
00:33:13,413 --> 00:33:15,413
Fuck you, batteries.

510
00:33:32,146 --> 00:33:34,273
Jesus.

511
00:33:41,613 --> 00:33:44,480
I'll pay you back.

512
00:33:47,079 --> 00:33:49,079
Come on.

513
00:34:01,346 --> 00:34:04,461
# Are you really here #

514
00:34:04,561 --> 00:34:08,465
# Or am I dreaming? #

515
00:34:08,565 --> 00:34:14,061
# I can't tell dream
from truth #

516
00:34:14,161 --> 00:34:17,159
# For it's been so long #

517
00:34:17,259 --> 00:34:20,996
# Since I have seen you #

518
00:34:21,096 --> 00:34:26,966
# I can hardly remember
your face anymore #

519
00:34:27,066 --> 00:34:33,663
# When I get pretty lonely #

520
00:34:33,763 --> 00:34:39,498
# And the distance
causes only silence #

521
00:34:39,598 --> 00:34:46,095
# I think of you smiling #

522
00:34:46,195 --> 00:34:49,794
# With pride in your eyes #

523
00:34:49,894 --> 00:34:53,326
# Lover that sighs #

524
00:34:53,426 --> 00:34:59,198
# If you want me #

525
00:34:59,298 --> 00:35:05,666
# Satisfy me #

526
00:35:05,766 --> 00:35:11,930
# If you want me #

527
00:35:12,030 --> 00:35:18,475
# Satisfy me #

528
00:35:20,313 --> 00:35:27,700
# Are you really sure
that you believe me #

529
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:33,362
# When others say I lie? #

530
00:35:33,462 --> 00:35:40,333
# I wonder if you could
ever despise me #

531
00:35:40,433 --> 00:35:46,063
# When you know I really tried #

532
00:35:46,163 --> 00:35:49,497
# To be a better one #

533
00:35:49,597 --> 00:35:52,998
# To satisfy you #

534
00:35:53,098 --> 00:35:58,797
# For you're everything to me #

535
00:35:58,897 --> 00:36:05,564
# And I'll do what you ask me #

536
00:36:05,664 --> 00:36:12,533
# If you let me be free #

537
00:36:12,633 --> 00:36:18,533
# If you want me #

538
00:36:18,633 --> 00:36:24,999
# Satisfy me #

539
00:36:25,099 --> 00:36:31,364
# If you want me #

540
00:36:31,464 --> 00:36:38,181
# Satisfy me #

541
00:36:50,513 --> 00:36:56,731
# If you want me #

542
00:36:56,831 --> 00:37:02,963
# Satisfy me #

543
00:37:03,063 --> 00:37:09,432
# If you want me #

544
00:37:09,532 --> 00:37:15,611
# Satisfy me #

545
00:37:22,213 --> 00:37:28,812
(music continues)

00:37:57,346 --> 00:38:01,664
# Escalated #

548
00:38:01,764 --> 00:38:08,209
# Little cracks they escalated #

549
00:38:09,313 --> 00:38:15,761
# From back inside comes #

550
00:38:15,861 --> 00:38:19,995
# Lies, lies #

551
00:38:20,095 --> 00:38:24,262
# Breaking... #

552
00:38:24,362 --> 00:38:26,460
# When will... #

553
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:27,680
When will you learn?

554
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:29,780
When will you learn?

555
00:38:33,413 --> 00:38:40,699
# I think it's time
we give it up #

556
00:38:40,799 --> 00:38:47,295
# And figure out
what's stopping us #

557
00:38:47,395 --> 00:38:54,097
# From breathing easy #

558
00:38:54,197 --> 00:39:01,398
# And talking straight #

559
00:39:01,498 --> 00:39:08,097
# The way is clear
if you're ready now #

560
00:39:08,197 --> 00:39:15,831
# The volunteer
is slowing down #

561
00:39:15,931 --> 00:39:20,698
# And taking time #

562
00:39:20,798 --> 00:39:29,668
# To save himself #

563
00:39:29,768 --> 00:39:36,864
# The little cracks,
they escalated #

564
00:39:36,964 --> 00:39:43,029
# Before we knew
it was too late #

565
00:39:43,129 --> 00:39:50,466
# For making circles #

566
00:39:50,566 --> 00:39:56,816
# And telling lies #

567
00:40:03,547 --> 00:40:09,365
# And I, I can't
keep up with you #

568
00:40:09,465 --> 00:40:16,198
# Maybe if you
slowed down for me #

569
00:40:16,298 --> 00:40:21,497
# I could see
you're only telling #

570
00:40:21,597 --> 00:40:27,398
# Lies, lies, lies #

571
00:40:27,498 --> 00:40:33,163
# Breaking us down with your #

572
00:40:33,263 --> 00:40:38,863
# Lies, lies, lies #

573
00:40:38,963 --> 00:40:44,715
# When will you learn? #

574
00:40:55,513 --> 00:41:00,541
(piano plays)

575
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:15,066
# The little cracks,

580
00:41:46,830 --> 00:41:52,896
# Maybe if you'd
slow down for me #

581
00:41:52,996 --> 00:41:58,630
# I could see
you're only telling #

586
00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:28,108
# So plant the thought #

587
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:31,941
(music continues)

588
00:42:35,713 --> 00:42:37,680
(ends)

589
00:42:37,780 --> 00:42:39,246
Would you like to buy a flower?

590
00:42:39,346 --> 00:42:40,913
- Hi. How are you?
- How's it going?

591
00:42:41,013 --> 00:42:42,213
Pretty good.

592
00:42:42,313 --> 00:42:44,146
- Pretty good.
- Good to see you.

593
00:42:44,246 --> 00:42:46,613
I'm going to go to
London, I've decided.

594
00:42:46,713 --> 00:42:47,714
- Good.
- Yeah.

595
00:42:47,814 --> 00:42:48,747
That's great.

596
00:42:48,847 --> 00:42:50,280
Yeah, it's good,
it makes sense.

597
00:42:50,380 --> 00:42:52,080
Well done.

598
00:42:52,180 --> 00:42:53,747
When are you going?

599
00:42:53,847 --> 00:42:55,927
I'm going
to go Monday.

600
00:42:56,027 --> 00:42:58,262
Wow, that's, that's soon.

601
00:42:58,362 --> 00:43:00,847
You'll get
your girlfriend back,

602
00:43:00,947 --> 00:43:02,880
and you'll get
your record deal, and...

603
00:43:02,980 --> 00:43:05,931
- become famous.
- Yeah, right.

604
00:43:06,031 --> 00:43:07,246
- Good.
- But listen,

605
00:43:07,346 --> 00:43:08,913
I was thinking, I was
thinking before I go,

606
00:43:09,013 --> 00:43:10,946
I want to make a recording
of a few songs.

607
00:43:11,046 --> 00:43:12,513
A couple of the songs
I was playing you,

608
00:43:12,613 --> 00:43:15,013
and I really liked the way
you played and your singing.

609
00:43:15,113 --> 00:43:17,613
So, if you feel like, would
you be into playing along?

610
00:43:17,713 --> 00:43:18,979
Like what we
were playing on?

611
00:43:19,079 --> 00:43:20,913
- I would sing and play?
- Yeah.

612
00:43:21,013 --> 00:43:22,380
I'd love that.

613
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:23,780
Really? Cool.

614
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:26,213
- So you'd be in my band for a few days.
- Yeah.

615
00:43:26,313 --> 00:43:30,428
Well, that's the first thing
I've got sorted out.

616
00:43:30,528 --> 00:43:32,180
Now I just need to sort
everything else out.

617
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:35,113
All right, guys, welcome.

618
00:43:36,914 --> 00:43:38,946
Now, so let me
give you the tour.

619
00:43:39,046 --> 00:43:41,480
That is your
live rooms in there.

620
00:43:41,580 --> 00:43:43,113
This is a new desk.

621
00:43:43,213 --> 00:43:46,146
You got your hard drive and
you got your outboard gear.

622
00:43:46,246 --> 00:43:47,680
Now all in all
we're talking about

623
00:43:47,780 --> 00:43:48,780
three grand
for a weekend of...

624
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:49,880
- Three?
- Yeah.

625
00:43:49,980 --> 00:43:51,413
Three grand, that's pretty good.

626
00:43:51,513 --> 00:43:52,814
You must be crazy.

627
00:43:52,914 --> 00:43:54,013
$3,000

628
00:43:54,113 --> 00:43:56,396
Well, have a look around.

629
00:43:56,496 --> 00:43:59,060
You've everything
you need.

630
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:02,046
- What do you think, is it good?
- (softly): It's pretty good.

631
00:44:02,146 --> 00:44:04,564
We'll give you one.

632
00:44:04,664 --> 00:44:06,246
(chuckles)

633
00:44:06,346 --> 00:44:07,313
I'm sorry.

634
00:44:07,413 --> 00:44:08,714
Have you heard
this guy's songs?

635
00:44:08,814 --> 00:44:10,113
I haven't yet, no.

636
00:44:10,213 --> 00:44:11,180
He's great.

637
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:12,246
Okay, but, uh,

638
00:44:12,346 --> 00:44:15,746
listen, I can fill
this place in an hour.

639
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:20,840
One and a half then,
that's my limit.

640
00:44:22,613 --> 00:44:24,413
We can talk about two.

641
00:44:24,513 --> 00:44:26,046
We don't talk.

642
00:44:26,146 --> 00:44:27,380
We shake.

643
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:28,613
We shake on two, yeah?

644
00:44:28,713 --> 00:44:30,513
Shake now?

645
00:44:30,613 --> 00:44:31,714
All right.

646
00:44:31,814 --> 00:44:32,714
Two thousand.

647
00:44:32,814 --> 00:44:33,880
She drives a hard bargain.

648
00:44:33,980 --> 00:44:35,980
She's a tough cookie.

649
00:44:39,947 --> 00:44:42,527
So you like this shop?

650
00:44:42,627 --> 00:44:44,862
I buy all my clothes here.

651
00:44:44,962 --> 00:44:46,847
It's good for me, you know?

652
00:44:46,947 --> 00:44:48,513
Cheap.

653
00:44:48,613 --> 00:44:50,638
Nice fashions.

654
00:44:51,780 --> 00:44:52,713
Okay, you ready?

655
00:44:52,813 --> 00:44:54,906
Yeah, I'm ready.

656
00:45:00,113 --> 00:45:01,680
That's good. That will do.

657
00:45:01,780 --> 00:45:03,613
<i>Do you like it?</i>

658
00:45:03,713 --> 00:45:04,814
You're gorgeous.

659
00:45:04,914 --> 00:45:06,914
All right, can we go?

660
00:45:14,947 --> 00:45:15,847
(tape clicks on)

661
00:45:15,947 --> 00:45:18,797
# #

662
00:45:18,897 --> 00:45:23,664
(man singing on tape)

663
00:45:23,764 --> 00:45:25,747
# #

664
00:45:32,847 --> 00:45:34,146
The quality is poor,

665
00:45:34,246 --> 00:45:37,280
but if we can get
a professional tape,

666
00:45:37,380 --> 00:45:41,970
I'm, I'm satisfied that he
can secure a lucrative deal.

667
00:45:43,613 --> 00:45:45,747
You take it home, you,
you listen to it.

668
00:45:45,847 --> 00:45:47,079
You play it to your boss.

669
00:45:47,179 --> 00:45:50,154
I'm sure you can
get him to approve.

670
00:45:51,113 --> 00:45:52,380
Can I show you something?

671
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:56,426
# I want to be free #

672
00:45:56,526 --> 00:45:58,013
# I want to be me #

673
00:45:58,113 --> 00:46:01,464
# I want you to bayou #

674
00:46:01,564 --> 00:46:07,042
(music continues)

675
00:46:11,547 --> 00:46:13,547
(ends)

676
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:30,926
Nice one, lads.

677
00:46:31,026 --> 00:46:31,979
How's it going?

678
00:46:32,079 --> 00:46:33,080
How's it going?
All right.

679
00:46:33,180 --> 00:46:34,146
Good, how is it today?

680
00:46:34,246 --> 00:46:35,146
Is it slow?

681
00:46:35,246 --> 00:46:36,814
Have a look
there yourself.

682
00:46:36,914 --> 00:46:38,914
Is that it? Is that it?

683
00:46:40,146 --> 00:46:41,447
That's how it's
going at the moment.

684
00:46:41,547 --> 00:46:42,680
Listen, I wanted
to ask you,

685
00:46:42,780 --> 00:46:44,313
as myself and herself
are making a tape...

686
00:46:44,413 --> 00:46:45,613
How's it going?
All right?

687
00:46:45,713 --> 00:46:48,013
of a few songs down
at Samson's Studios

688
00:46:48,113 --> 00:46:50,346
and I was just wondering, if
you were around next weekend,

689
00:46:50,446 --> 00:46:52,780
for, to, if you'd be
interested in doing it.

690
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:53,780
A bit of recording?

691
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:54,780
Bit of recording, yeah?

692
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:56,280
Yeah, doing Lizzy
stuff. or...?

693
00:46:56,380 --> 00:46:58,013
No, it's not Lizzy,
it's me own songs.

694
00:46:58,113 --> 00:46:59,213
We only do Lizzy.

695
00:46:59,313 --> 00:47:02,231
Really. It's one
of our things.

696
00:47:02,331 --> 00:47:06,146
That sort of stuff. Is it, sort
of rocky Lizzy stuff or...?

697
00:47:06,246 --> 00:47:08,630
- No. No, it's not.
- Yeah,

698
00:47:08,730 --> 00:47:09,814
Singer-songwriter stuff?

699
00:47:09,914 --> 00:47:11,146
It's kind of singer-songwriter, yeah.

700
00:47:11,246 --> 00:47:12,613
- Kinda...
- Is it any good?

701
00:47:12,713 --> 00:47:13,613
- Uh...
- It's great.

702
00:47:13,713 --> 00:47:15,113
Is it?

703
00:47:15,213 --> 00:47:16,113
Well, look, like I said,

704
00:47:16,213 --> 00:47:17,480
I don't really know
much about them,

705
00:47:17,580 --> 00:47:18,647
but they seem
like nice people.

706
00:47:18,747 --> 00:47:20,213
Yeah. I just have to
call my mother first.

707
00:47:20,313 --> 00:47:21,280
- Then we go.
- Cool.

708
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:22,313
Great, great.

709
00:47:22,413 --> 00:47:25,439
(speaking Czech)

710
00:47:39,914 --> 00:47:41,914
(hanging up)

711
00:47:44,380 --> 00:47:45,613
Okay, come on,
we can go.

712
00:47:45,713 --> 00:47:47,713
Cool.

713
00:47:52,146 --> 00:47:55,138
(buzz of conversation)

714
00:48:04,313 --> 00:48:08,138
Food's ready! Everybody
get your plates ready!

715
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:17,461
- Hello?
- Hi, how are you?

716
00:48:17,561 --> 00:48:20,012
Come on in, kids!
Take a seat!

717
00:48:34,780 --> 00:48:35,946
Everything all right
here, folks?

718
00:48:36,046 --> 00:48:37,413
Yeah, brilliant.

719
00:48:37,513 --> 00:48:38,547
Enjoying the party?

720
00:48:38,647 --> 00:48:39,547
Yeah.

721
00:48:39,647 --> 00:48:40,580
Great to see you here.

722
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:42,080
- Can you sing?
- (laughing)

723
00:48:42,180 --> 00:48:43,513
If you can't sing,
you're out.

724
00:48:43,613 --> 00:48:48,431
# There's one request
I'll ask of you #

725
00:48:48,531 --> 00:48:53,764
# When your liberty you gave #

726
00:48:53,864 --> 00:48:58,564
# Remember Mitchell far away #

727
00:48:58,664 --> 00:49:03,498
# A convict bound in chains. #

728
00:49:03,598 --> 00:49:05,580
(applause, cheers)

729
00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:15,027
#... mine that once held
this heart of mine. #

730
00:49:15,127 --> 00:49:18,863
(cheers, whistles)

731
00:49:18,963 --> 00:49:21,696
# #

732
00:49:21,796 --> 00:49:27,165
# And I love her so #

733
00:49:27,265 --> 00:49:32,479
# I wouldn't trade her
for gold #

734
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:39,697
# I'm walking on moonbeams #

735
00:49:39,797 --> 00:49:45,343
# I was born
with a silver spoon #

736
00:49:47,246 --> 00:49:51,693
# Hell, I'm gonna be me #

737
00:49:51,793 --> 00:49:56,740
# I'm gonna be free #

738
00:49:58,914 --> 00:50:02,961
# I'm walking on moonbeams #

739
00:50:03,061 --> 00:50:09,110
# Staring out to sea #

740
00:50:11,079 --> 00:50:16,499
# And if a door be closed #

741
00:50:16,599 --> 00:50:21,813
# Then a row of homes
start building #

742
00:50:23,914 --> 00:50:29,698
# And tear your curtains down #

743
00:50:29,798 --> 00:50:36,913
# For sunlight is like gold #

744
00:50:37,913 --> 00:50:39,447
# Hell, you better be you #

745
00:50:39,547 --> 00:50:42,482
(music continues)

746
00:50:44,580 --> 00:50:48,161
(horn beeping)

747
00:50:48,261 --> 00:50:49,346
Hey.

748
00:50:49,446 --> 00:50:51,493
What are you doing here?

749
00:50:51,593 --> 00:50:54,013
I just came out.
You want to go for a spin?

750
00:50:54,113 --> 00:50:55,246
That's your bike?

751
00:50:55,346 --> 00:50:56,413
It's me dad's.

752
00:50:56,513 --> 00:50:58,113
He absolutely loves it,
but I've robbed it

753
00:50:58,213 --> 00:50:59,213
off him for the day.

754
00:50:59,313 --> 00:51:00,513
If he knew,
he'd kill me.

755
00:51:00,613 --> 00:51:03,092
Would he?

756
00:51:03,192 --> 00:51:05,475
So do you fancy a spin, no?

757
00:51:06,513 --> 00:51:08,613
I'd love to,
but I have to go to work.

758
00:51:08,713 --> 00:51:10,680
That's cool.

759
00:51:10,780 --> 00:51:12,747
Another time, yeah?

760
00:51:14,246 --> 00:51:17,136
and see if you were
into going now.

761
00:51:18,814 --> 00:51:20,380
Could you have me back by lunch?

762
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:22,560
Yeah, totally.

763
00:51:22,660 --> 00:51:24,313
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

764
00:51:24,413 --> 00:51:25,313
Fancy it?

765
00:51:25,413 --> 00:51:27,413
Great.

766
00:51:34,180 --> 00:51:38,708
(music continues)

767
00:51:46,813 --> 00:51:48,813
(ends)

768
00:52:04,046 --> 00:52:06,897
You're what?

769
00:52:06,997 --> 00:52:08,079
You're married.

770
00:52:08,179 --> 00:52:10,179
Does it surprise you?

771
00:52:11,113 --> 00:52:13,113
Fuck's sake.

772
00:52:14,313 --> 00:52:16,894
Yeah.

773
00:52:16,994 --> 00:52:18,346
When?

774
00:52:18,446 --> 00:52:21,680
Two years ago, when I find out
I'm pregnant with Ivonka.

775
00:52:21,780 --> 00:52:24,495
(sighs)

776
00:52:24,595 --> 00:52:27,560
So where is he?

777
00:52:27,660 --> 00:52:29,046
He's back in
Czech Republic.

778
00:52:29,146 --> 00:52:33,396
It's over now and, you know,
I come here on my own.

779
00:52:34,313 --> 00:52:35,213
(sighs)

780
00:52:35,313 --> 00:52:37,313
Man.

781
00:52:39,780 --> 00:52:41,780
You all right?

782
00:52:46,714 --> 00:52:48,714
(exhales)

783
00:52:53,113 --> 00:52:55,694
What's the Czech
for "ocean"?

784
00:52:55,794 --> 00:52:56,680
Ott-san.

785
00:52:56,780 --> 00:52:57,680
Ott-san.

786
00:52:57,780 --> 00:52:59,213
Pretty much the same.

787
00:52:59,313 --> 00:53:01,313
Otsan.

788
00:53:03,380 --> 00:53:05,420
So what are
you gonna do?

789
00:53:07,580 --> 00:53:09,580
I don't know.

790
00:53:11,713 --> 00:53:15,294
There's such distance
between me and him.

791
00:53:15,394 --> 00:53:18,280
He's so much different
to me and so much older.

792
00:53:18,380 --> 00:53:22,630
It doesn't really work.

793
00:53:22,730 --> 00:53:24,614
I'm fine on my own, you know?

794
00:53:24,714 --> 00:53:29,644
It's just, I don't want Ivonka
to grow up without a father.

795
00:53:34,380 --> 00:53:37,907
What's the Czech for...
"Do you love him?"

796
00:53:39,046 --> 00:53:40,313
Noor-esh-ho?

797
00:53:40,413 --> 00:53:42,280
Noor-esh-ho?

798
00:53:42,380 --> 00:53:43,946
So...

799
00:53:44,046 --> 00:53:46,046
Noor-esh-ho?

800
00:53:47,580 --> 00:53:49,580
Noor-ho-tebbe.

801
00:53:51,446 --> 00:53:52,313
What?

802
00:53:52,413 --> 00:53:53,946
Come on, let's go.

803
00:53:54,046 --> 00:53:55,113
What'd you say?

804
00:53:55,213 --> 00:53:57,946
- Tell me.
- You've got to teach me how to ride

805
00:53:58,046 --> 00:54:00,430
- the bike now, eh?
- No way.

806
00:54:00,530 --> 00:54:01,513
- Yeah.
- No.

807
00:54:01,613 --> 00:54:03,380
So come on, can I have a go?

808
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:04,380
No.

809
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:05,680
Please.

810
00:54:05,780 --> 00:54:08,760
No, leave it alone, will you?

811
00:54:08,860 --> 00:54:12,028
But teach me how to
drive it, will you?

812
00:54:12,128 --> 00:54:12,980
Come on, just once.

813
00:54:13,080 --> 00:54:13,979
No, it's not mine.

814
00:54:14,079 --> 00:54:15,046
Me dad would go
fucking crazy.

815
00:54:15,146 --> 00:54:16,079
But he's not here now.

816
00:54:16,179 --> 00:54:17,080
Be careful, will you!

817
00:54:17,180 --> 00:54:18,547
Be careful,
for fuck's sake.

818
00:54:18,647 --> 00:54:19,880
Look, he's not
here now.

819
00:54:19,980 --> 00:54:21,946
- Just teach me.
- Look, my dad. Look. No, no, no.

820
00:54:22,046 --> 00:54:22,946
- No?
- No.

821
00:54:23,046 --> 00:54:25,964
- Please?
- No.

822
00:54:26,064 --> 00:54:27,480
Me dad will go
bleedin' mental.

823
00:54:27,580 --> 00:54:29,046
He totally loves this thing.

824
00:54:29,146 --> 00:54:30,880
Yeah, but you drive it.

825
00:54:30,980 --> 00:54:32,447
Yeah, he doesn't
know I have it.

826
00:54:32,547 --> 00:54:33,447
He doesn't?

827
00:54:33,547 --> 00:54:34,547
No.

828
00:54:34,647 --> 00:54:37,480
Well, then he won't
know I had it, too.

829
00:54:37,580 --> 00:54:40,897
No.
You can't have a go on it.

830
00:54:40,997 --> 00:54:41,880
Just once.

831
00:54:41,980 --> 00:54:42,880
No.

832
00:54:42,980 --> 00:54:46,229
- Turn it on for me.
- No.

833
00:54:46,329 --> 00:54:47,213
No.

834
00:54:47,313 --> 00:54:48,480
Come on, give
us the keys.

835
00:54:48,580 --> 00:54:49,747
I'll do it myself.

836
00:54:49,847 --> 00:54:51,847
The key's in it.

837
00:55:01,580 --> 00:55:02,547
Thank you for the ride.

838
00:55:02,647 --> 00:55:03,613
I'll see you
tomorrow, yeah?

839
00:55:03,713 --> 00:55:05,146
- For rehearsals.
- Okay, yeah.

840
00:55:05,246 --> 00:55:06,146
Okay.

841
00:55:06,246 --> 00:55:08,286
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

842
00:55:12,580 --> 00:55:14,580
(horn beeping)

843
00:55:20,713 --> 00:55:25,377
# Tying to pull myself away #

844
00:55:29,580 --> 00:55:34,745
# I'm caught in a pattern
and I can't escape #

845
00:55:38,447 --> 00:55:44,249
# I'm trying
to pull myselfaway... #

846
00:55:50,246 --> 00:55:55,328
# Lately, when I get back,
there's this thing I know... #

847
00:55:55,428 --> 00:56:00,096
# Everything comes
to you, way to go #

848
00:56:00,196 --> 00:56:05,296
# Even a heart has
something to learn... #

849
00:56:05,396 --> 00:56:07,380
Thanks, Dad.

850
00:56:09,079 --> 00:56:10,780
All right, guys,
this is Eamon.

851
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:12,346
He's going to
take care of you

852
00:56:12,446 --> 00:56:13,480
for the weekend.

853
00:56:13,580 --> 00:56:14,979
Eamon, this is everyone.

854
00:56:15,079 --> 00:56:16,113
Kit's set up.

855
00:56:16,213 --> 00:56:18,946
Piano is waiting for you
in the live room.

856
00:56:19,046 --> 00:56:21,713
Tea and coffee in the kitchen
as you came in. Help yourselves.

857
00:56:21,813 --> 00:56:23,280
You'll need plenty.

858
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:24,881
And there is a nice
little burrito place

859
00:56:24,981 --> 00:56:26,747
around the corner if you
want a snack, all right?

860
00:56:26,847 --> 00:56:27,747
Great.

861
00:56:27,847 --> 00:56:29,080
Okay, Eamon,
leave it to you.

862
00:56:29,180 --> 00:56:30,313
Good luck, everyone.

863
00:56:30,413 --> 00:56:32,980
Enjoy. And I might pop in
later, all right?

864
00:56:33,080 --> 00:56:34,747
- Cheers, man.
- Cheers, thanks.

865
00:56:34,847 --> 00:56:36,880
Okay, guys,
good to meet you.

866
00:56:36,980 --> 00:56:38,280
We've a few little
bits and pieces

867
00:56:38,380 --> 00:56:39,313
to set up.

868
00:56:39,413 --> 00:56:40,847
I want to check
the drums inside.

869
00:56:40,947 --> 00:56:43,363
We've already set up the kit.

870
00:56:43,463 --> 00:56:46,713
Yeah, I just want to, you know,
check them for sound.

871
00:56:46,813 --> 00:56:48,813
I checked them already; it's fine.

872
00:56:48,913 --> 00:56:52,713
Okay, we need to set up mics
on them for recording, yeah?

873
00:56:52,813 --> 00:56:54,513
Oh.

874
00:56:54,613 --> 00:56:55,946
Have you done much recording?

875
00:56:56,046 --> 00:56:57,300
- No.
- No.

876
00:56:57,400 --> 00:56:57,714
No.

877
00:56:57,814 --> 00:57:00,789
- Right. Let's get cracking.
- Yeah.

878
00:57:10,814 --> 00:57:13,681
(tuning up)

879
00:57:28,213 --> 00:57:29,913
Yeah, no, I can't
do it now, love.

880
00:57:30,013 --> 00:57:31,246
I'm stuck here in the studio

881
00:57:31,346 --> 00:57:32,946
with this bunch
of fucking oddballs.

882
00:57:33,046 --> 00:57:36,046
Can you hang on a second?
Just one second.

883
00:57:36,146 --> 00:57:37,747
(strums guitar)

884
00:57:37,847 --> 00:57:39,180
Okay, are you ready to rock?

885
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:40,146
Are we ready?

886
00:57:40,246 --> 00:57:42,246
Yep. We're in tune.

887
00:57:43,880 --> 00:57:45,913
So Al and Timmy,
on the second verse, just...

888
00:57:46,013 --> 00:57:48,046
this is pretty much
simple enough thing.

889
00:57:48,146 --> 00:57:49,647
It's in five-four,
and the second verse,

890
00:57:49,747 --> 00:57:51,647
I'll give you a nod
to come in there, yeah?

891
00:57:51,747 --> 00:57:53,713
Is that all right? And you're in
from the top with me, yeah?

892
00:57:53,813 --> 00:57:56,448
And you know what you're doing.

893
00:57:57,246 --> 00:58:00,996
All right, then, so, uh...

894
00:58:01,096 --> 00:58:03,459
whenever you're ready, yeah.

895
00:58:05,113 --> 00:58:07,323
(talking on phone quietly)

896
00:58:09,813 --> 00:58:11,927
All right, later.

897
00:58:12,027 --> 00:58:13,647
Okay, we're ready. Fire one.

898
00:58:13,747 --> 00:58:15,446
You sure you're ready?

899
00:58:15,546 --> 00:58:18,913
Okay, listen now for
the click track, everybody.

900
00:58:19,013 --> 00:58:20,413
And away we go.

901
00:58:20,513 --> 00:58:25,331
This is track one,
take one, yeah.

902
00:58:25,431 --> 00:58:29,238
All right, lads, here we go,
this is it, yeah.

903
00:58:30,413 --> 00:58:34,315
(guitar strumming melody)

904
00:58:46,146 --> 00:58:49,497
# So #

905
00:58:49,597 --> 00:58:54,128
# If you want something #

906
00:58:54,228 --> 00:58:57,963
# And you call, call #

907
00:58:58,063 --> 00:59:01,992
# Then I'll come running #

908
00:59:02,092 --> 00:59:04,795
# To fight #

909
00:59:04,895 --> 00:59:08,577
# And I'll be at your door #

910
00:59:09,747 --> 00:59:17,634
# When there's nothing
worth running for #

911
00:59:17,734 --> 00:59:21,727
# When your mind's made up #

912
00:59:21,827 --> 00:59:25,827
# When your mind's
made up #

913
00:59:25,927 --> 00:59:29,629
# There's no point
trying to change it #

914
00:59:29,729 --> 00:59:33,896
# When your mind's made up #

915
00:59:33,996 --> 00:59:37,460
# When your mind's
made up #

916
00:59:37,560 --> 00:59:41,864
# There's no point
trying to stop it #

917
00:59:41,964 --> 00:59:44,364
# You see #

918
00:59:44,464 --> 00:59:49,163
# You're just like everyone #

919
00:59:49,263 --> 00:59:53,030
# When the shit falls #

920
00:59:53,130 --> 00:59:58,642
# All you want to do
is run away #

921
01:00:00,913 --> 01:00:04,460
# And hide all by yourself #

922
01:00:04,560 --> 01:00:08,195
# When you're far from me #

923
01:00:08,295 --> 01:00:13,294
# There's nothing else #

924
01:00:13,394 --> 01:00:17,163
# When your mind's made up #

925
01:00:17,263 --> 01:00:20,928
# When your mind's
made up #

926
01:00:21,028 --> 01:00:24,864
# There's no point trying
to change it #

927
01:00:24,964 --> 01:00:28,893
# When your mind's made up #

928
01:00:28,993 --> 01:00:32,994
# When your mind's
made up #

929
01:00:33,094 --> 01:00:36,762
# There's no point
even talking #

930
01:00:36,862 --> 01:00:40,765
# When your mind's made up #

931
01:00:40,865 --> 01:00:44,793
# When your mind's
made up #

932
01:00:44,893 --> 01:00:48,630
# There's no point
trying to fight it #

933
01:00:48,730 --> 01:00:52,963
# When your mind's #

934
01:00:53,063 --> 01:01:01,062

935
01:01:01,162 --> 01:01:05,093
# Made #

936
01:01:05,193 --> 01:01:07,239
# Up... #

937
01:01:15,947 --> 01:01:20,264
# Ah #

938
01:01:20,364 --> 01:01:23,961
# There's no point trying
to change it #

939
01:01:24,061 --> 01:01:32,029
# When your #

940
01:01:32,129 --> 01:01:40,418
# 0h #

941
01:01:47,914 --> 01:01:56,879
# Ooh, ooh #

942
01:02:00,113 --> 01:02:05,779
# So... if you ever
want something #

943
01:02:07,613 --> 01:02:11,863
# And you call, call #

944
01:02:11,963 --> 01:02:16,179
# Then I'll come running. #

945
01:02:21,713 --> 01:02:23,346
(sighs)

946
01:02:23,446 --> 01:02:25,213
Okay.

947
01:02:25,313 --> 01:02:27,046
Wow.

948
01:02:27,146 --> 01:02:29,146
That was nice.

949
01:02:30,046 --> 01:02:31,680
Did you write that?

950
01:02:31,780 --> 01:02:33,780
Yeah.

951
01:02:34,480 --> 01:02:36,480
(synth beat)

952
01:02:39,413 --> 01:02:44,563
# You must have
fallen from the sky #

953
01:02:44,663 --> 01:02:47,547
# You must have shattered
in the runway #

954
01:02:47,647 --> 01:02:52,584
(music continues)

955
01:03:15,880 --> 01:03:20,197
# You need somewhere
to fall apart #

956
01:03:20,297 --> 01:03:24,761
(continues)

957
01:03:24,861 --> 01:03:27,860
# Someone to fall upon #

958
01:03:27,960 --> 01:03:30,973
(continues)

959
01:03:34,547 --> 01:03:36,997
# That fools the bulls #

960
01:03:37,097 --> 01:03:39,046
# The powdered hag #

961
01:03:39,146 --> 01:03:41,673
(continues)

962
01:04:16,580 --> 01:04:18,530
(music ends)

963
01:04:18,630 --> 01:04:21,593
Okay, what do you think?

964
01:04:21,693 --> 01:04:23,928
I think it's fucking weird.

965
01:04:24,028 --> 01:04:27,547
There's a couple of little tech bits,
we can probably fix them,

966
01:04:27,647 --> 01:04:30,979
but uh, you know, it's 4:00 in the morning,
so it's up to you guys.

967
01:04:31,079 --> 01:04:34,447
Do you want to push through
or go for another one?

968
01:04:34,547 --> 01:04:37,113
I'd love to keep going
if everybody is into it.

969
01:04:37,213 --> 01:04:39,313
Can I have a cup of tea
or something first?

970
01:04:39,413 --> 01:04:41,080
Want a cup of tea?

971
01:04:41,180 --> 01:04:43,880
- You want to take ten or 15, yeah?
- Sure.

972
01:04:43,980 --> 01:04:45,380
I'll tweak what I can.

973
01:04:45,480 --> 01:04:46,880
You guys take ten.

974
01:04:46,980 --> 01:04:51,595
Guys, why do you think there
are no blonde priests?

975
01:04:51,695 --> 01:04:54,230
- I don't know.
- I don't know.

976
01:05:15,613 --> 01:05:17,613
This is great.

977
01:05:25,680 --> 01:05:30,811
(playing lush melody)

978
01:05:42,213 --> 01:05:44,213
How's it going?

979
01:05:46,279 --> 01:05:47,946
Good.

980
01:05:48,046 --> 01:05:50,213
I don't think we're supposed
to be here, though.

981
01:05:50,313 --> 01:05:52,792
Ah, it's all right.

982
01:05:52,892 --> 01:05:54,313
This is beautiful, isn't it?

983
01:05:54,413 --> 01:05:56,747
Yeah, it's a beautiful piano,
like a Baldwin.

984
01:05:56,847 --> 01:05:57,913
It's a perfect piano.

985
01:05:58,013 --> 01:05:59,313
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

986
01:05:59,413 --> 01:06:03,495
Play us one of your songs.

987
01:06:03,595 --> 01:06:07,280
Hmm... They're
all half-written and more ideas.

988
01:06:07,380 --> 01:06:09,760
Go on, I'd love to hear one.

989
01:06:11,446 --> 01:06:13,280
Okay, I have one,

990
01:06:13,380 --> 01:06:16,927
but... it's not finished and I...

991
01:06:17,027 --> 01:06:18,213
I don't really...

992
01:06:18,313 --> 01:06:19,380
Just play it, I know.

993
01:06:19,480 --> 01:06:21,146
Okay, but the lyrics
are very rough, okay?

994
01:06:21,246 --> 01:06:23,908
- It'll be great.
- Okay.

995
01:06:38,380 --> 01:06:44,198
# Walking up the hill
tonight #

996
01:06:44,298 --> 01:06:49,650
# When you have closed
your eyes #

997
01:06:53,079 --> 01:06:57,897
# I wish I didn't have
to make #

998
01:06:57,997 --> 01:07:03,441
# All those mistakes
and be wise #

999
01:07:06,947 --> 01:07:12,265
# But please try
to be patient #

1000
01:07:12,365 --> 01:07:18,342
# And know
that I'm still learning #

1001
01:07:21,613 --> 01:07:27,533
# I'm sorry
that you have to see #

1002
01:07:27,633 --> 01:07:32,516
# The strength inside me
burning #

1003
01:07:35,680 --> 01:07:41,830
# And where are you,
my angel, now? #

1004
01:07:41,930 --> 01:07:48,682
# Don't you see me crying? #

1005
01:07:50,079 --> 01:07:55,296
# I know that you can't
do it all #

1006
01:07:55,396 --> 01:08:01,944
# But you can't say
I'm not trying #

1007
01:08:03,980 --> 01:08:09,461
# And I'm letting myself down #

1008
01:08:09,561 --> 01:08:16,316
# By satisfying you #

1009
01:08:18,380 --> 01:08:24,300
# I really wish
that you could see #

1010
01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:26,380
# I... #

1011
01:08:39,513 --> 01:08:42,026
You all right?

1012
01:08:42,126 --> 01:08:43,513
(sighs)

1013
01:08:43,613 --> 01:08:44,946
Did you write that
for your husband?

1014
01:08:45,046 --> 01:08:46,280
(laughing):
Yes, I did,

1015
01:08:46,380 --> 01:08:47,847
and he didn't like it.

1016
01:08:47,947 --> 01:08:49,513
What an idiot.

1017
01:08:49,613 --> 01:08:51,613
Yeah, he's an idiot.

1018
01:09:09,046 --> 01:09:11,046
(sighing)

1019
01:09:17,747 --> 01:09:21,063
Come on away to London with me.

1020
01:09:21,163 --> 01:09:23,714
Come on, we'll write loads of
songs and live in a nice flat.

1021
01:09:23,814 --> 01:09:25,346
You can bring Ivonka over,
it'll be brilliant.

1022
01:09:25,446 --> 01:09:26,780
Come on.

1023
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:28,513
Yeah, we'll go to London

1024
01:09:28,613 --> 01:09:30,714
and no one will ever
find us again.

1025
01:09:30,814 --> 01:09:31,913
- No one.
- No one.

1026
01:09:32,013 --> 01:09:33,347
We'll have a brilliant band.

1027
01:09:33,447 --> 01:09:35,480
We'll sell out all the places
and it'll be great.

1028
01:09:35,580 --> 01:09:37,313
And we'll make
an album together?

1029
01:09:37,413 --> 01:09:38,847
I'd love that, come on.

1030
01:09:38,947 --> 01:09:40,313
Yeah, and, and I'll do

1031
01:09:40,413 --> 01:09:41,413
the backing vocals on it?

1032
01:09:41,513 --> 01:09:42,647
Yeah, and play
the piano.

1033
01:09:42,747 --> 01:09:43,913
Mm-hmm.

1034
01:09:44,013 --> 01:09:45,346
Come on, I'm serious.

1035
01:09:45,446 --> 01:09:47,446
Can I bring my mother?

1036
01:09:53,046 --> 01:09:56,038
Well, we should go back
to work.

1037
01:09:58,446 --> 01:10:00,446
- Yeah.
- Okay.

1038
01:10:01,480 --> 01:10:06,543
(music playing on speakers)

1039
01:10:14,146 --> 01:10:17,138
(sighing)

1040
01:10:20,146 --> 01:10:21,747
What day is it today?

1041
01:10:21,847 --> 01:10:23,313
(laughter)

1042
01:10:23,413 --> 01:10:25,363
Monday.

1043
01:10:25,463 --> 01:10:28,480
I think it's time we did
the, uh, the car test.

1044
01:10:28,580 --> 01:10:30,480
What's the car
test, Eamon?

1045
01:10:30,580 --> 01:10:32,613
We've been listening
back on these, uh,

1046
01:10:32,713 --> 01:10:34,146
big studio speakers.

1047
01:10:34,246 --> 01:10:37,380
So it's time we had a go
on some shitty speakers.

1048
01:10:37,480 --> 01:10:38,547
So...

1049
01:10:38,647 --> 01:10:39,713
All right, let's go.

1050
01:10:39,813 --> 01:10:41,979
Let's go for a spin
and have a listen in me car.

1051
01:10:42,079 --> 01:10:43,246
Great, man.

1052
01:10:43,346 --> 01:10:44,580
- Yeah.
- Go have a ride, yeah?

1053
01:10:44,680 --> 01:10:46,630
Let's go.

1054
01:10:46,730 --> 01:10:50,275
We'll clear this up later.

1055
01:10:51,313 --> 01:10:53,263
Timmy!

1056
01:10:53,363 --> 01:10:55,792
Timmy!

1057
01:10:55,892 --> 01:10:56,847
Come on.

1058
01:10:56,947 --> 01:10:58,947
Beauty.

1059
01:11:06,079 --> 01:11:08,079
Beauty.

1060
01:11:08,647 --> 01:11:10,647
All right.

1061
01:11:13,546 --> 01:11:15,546
(music playing)

1062
01:11:29,313 --> 01:11:31,975
(singing)

1063
01:12:03,113 --> 01:12:05,638
(music continues)

1064
01:12:41,413 --> 01:12:44,075
(continues)

1065
01:13:21,380 --> 01:13:24,162
(fades)

1066
01:13:24,262 --> 01:13:25,547
There they are.

1067
01:13:25,647 --> 01:13:26,680
(sighing)

1068
01:13:26,780 --> 01:13:27,847
Listen, man, fucking...

1069
01:13:27,947 --> 01:13:29,246
- Well done.
- It sounds fucking brilliant.

1070
01:13:29,346 --> 01:13:31,380
- Thanks a lot for your help.
- Lots of luck with those.

1071
01:13:31,480 --> 01:13:32,814
- Nice one.
- I just pressed the buttons.

1072
01:13:32,914 --> 01:13:33,880
It was great.

1073
01:13:33,980 --> 01:13:35,113
Nice, man, thank you.

1074
01:13:35,213 --> 01:13:37,080
- Cool.
- You two go and get some sleep.

1075
01:13:37,180 --> 01:13:38,146
Right, nice one.

1076
01:13:38,246 --> 01:13:41,561
- And thanks very, very much.
- See you.

1077
01:13:47,580 --> 01:13:49,113
So this is it.

1078
01:13:49,213 --> 01:13:51,079
- Yeah.
- We did it.

1079
01:13:51,179 --> 01:13:52,813
It sounds great.

1080
01:13:52,913 --> 01:13:54,046
It does, doesn't it?

1081
01:13:54,146 --> 01:13:55,213
Could I have one?

1082
01:13:55,313 --> 01:13:56,647
- Yeah, yeah, totally.
- Thank you.

1083
01:13:56,747 --> 01:13:59,063
I've got to
go this way.

1084
01:13:59,163 --> 01:14:01,096
Really.

1085
01:14:01,196 --> 01:14:03,096
Where you going?

1086
01:14:03,196 --> 01:14:05,146
Home.

1087
01:14:06,480 --> 01:14:07,613
You don't want
to come back?

1088
01:14:07,713 --> 01:14:08,714
I'll make you breakfast.

1089
01:14:08,814 --> 01:14:10,346
- We could listen to the CD, no?
- No.

1090
01:14:10,446 --> 01:14:13,780
I have to go see Ivonka
and organize things.

1091
01:14:13,880 --> 01:14:15,046
So do you.

1092
01:14:15,146 --> 01:14:16,180
Yeah.

1093
01:14:16,280 --> 01:14:17,680
You're leaving.

1094
01:14:17,780 --> 01:14:19,730
To London.

1095
01:14:19,830 --> 01:14:21,213
What do you have
to organize?

1096
01:14:21,313 --> 01:14:22,380
What's, what's that about?

1097
01:14:22,480 --> 01:14:25,347
I, I spoke to my
husband last night.

1098
01:14:25,447 --> 01:14:26,613
He's coming over.

1099
01:14:26,713 --> 01:14:28,513
Ah, brilliant.
Fair play-That's great.

1100
01:14:28,613 --> 01:14:30,246
- I'm really happy for you.
- It's good. Yeah.

1101
01:14:30,346 --> 01:14:32,494
We'll try to
make it work.

1102
01:14:32,594 --> 01:14:33,814
It's for the best.

1103
01:14:33,914 --> 01:14:35,113
Yeah.

1104
01:14:35,213 --> 01:14:37,180
Come back and hang out,
have a cup of tea.

1105
01:14:37,280 --> 01:14:38,614
It's the last day.
We'll hang out.

1106
01:14:38,714 --> 01:14:41,222
Whatever, breakfast, whatever.

1107
01:14:41,322 --> 01:14:42,346
Listen to the tunes.

1108
01:14:42,446 --> 01:14:44,313
Or you can come over later,
whatever.

1109
01:14:44,413 --> 01:14:46,397
For what?

1110
01:14:46,497 --> 01:14:48,146
What do you mean, what?

1111
01:14:48,246 --> 01:14:50,179
Just hang, just come
and hang out.

1112
01:14:50,279 --> 01:14:51,814
But we done our work.

1113
01:14:51,914 --> 01:14:53,146
Why would I go over?

1114
01:14:53,246 --> 01:14:56,221
We'd just hanky panky
If I come now.

1115
01:14:57,213 --> 01:14:58,613
What?

1116
01:14:58,713 --> 01:15:00,713
Hanky panky?

1117
01:15:01,446 --> 01:15:03,113
It won't be for hanky panky.

1118
01:15:03,213 --> 01:15:05,213
I know it would.

1119
01:15:07,213 --> 01:15:09,962
And that would be nice.

1120
01:15:10,062 --> 01:15:11,180
Would it?

1121
01:15:11,280 --> 01:15:13,380
- Hanky... Would it?
- Very interesting.

1122
01:15:13,480 --> 01:15:16,472
Be worthless though.

1123
01:15:19,780 --> 01:15:22,749
Come back later.

1124
01:15:24,780 --> 01:15:26,780
Mmm.

1125
01:15:30,580 --> 01:15:32,380
Okay, I'll come.

1126
01:15:32,480 --> 01:15:33,747
Yeah?

1127
01:15:33,847 --> 01:15:35,013
I'll come later, yeah.

1128
01:15:35,113 --> 01:15:36,480
Brilliant.

1129
01:15:36,580 --> 01:15:37,647
You sure?

1130
01:15:37,747 --> 01:15:39,013
Brilliant.

1131
01:15:39,113 --> 01:15:40,146
All right, then...

1132
01:15:40,246 --> 01:15:42,113
Cool. See you after.
Well done.

1133
01:15:42,213 --> 01:15:44,213
You, too.

1134
01:16:33,213 --> 01:16:41,018
(music playing on tape)

1135
01:16:57,113 --> 01:16:59,113
(ends)

1136
01:17:04,613 --> 01:17:06,653
Well, what do you think?

1137
01:17:10,613 --> 01:17:12,727
You like it?

1138
01:17:12,827 --> 01:17:15,153
It's just a demo,
you know...

1139
01:17:15,253 --> 01:17:16,580
It's fucking brilliant.

1140
01:17:16,680 --> 01:17:17,847
Really?

1141
01:17:17,947 --> 01:17:19,897
Fantastic stuff.

1142
01:17:19,997 --> 01:17:22,898
That'll be a hit, no question.

1143
01:17:22,998 --> 01:17:25,459
When are you off?

1144
01:17:25,559 --> 01:17:27,446
What?

1145
01:17:27,546 --> 01:17:30,179
Well, I've a few hundred quid
for you

1146
01:17:30,279 --> 01:17:32,731
for a deposit on a place.

1147
01:17:32,831 --> 01:17:34,780
Going to come over
and see you

1148
01:17:34,880 --> 01:17:36,880
when you're settled in.

1149
01:17:38,113 --> 01:17:41,343
When do you think
you'll be able to go?

1150
01:17:42,146 --> 01:17:44,046
I'm going tomorrow, Dad.

1151
01:17:44,146 --> 01:17:46,096
Good man.

1152
01:17:46,196 --> 01:17:47,814
About time.

1153
01:17:47,914 --> 01:17:49,914
(chuckles)

1154
01:17:51,813 --> 01:17:53,763
Will you be all right?

1155
01:17:53,863 --> 01:17:55,813
What do you mean?

1156
01:17:57,747 --> 01:18:01,979
I was all right for years
before you came along, wasn't I?

1157
01:18:02,079 --> 01:18:04,346
I don't have to go now.
I can put this thing off

1158
01:18:04,446 --> 01:18:06,180
- for a few months.
- Go.

1159
01:18:06,280 --> 01:18:07,780
And the best

1160
01:18:07,880 --> 01:18:09,513
of luck, son.

1161
01:18:09,613 --> 01:18:11,146
Thanks, Dad.

1162
01:18:11,246 --> 01:18:14,374
Make your ma proud.

1163
01:18:17,547 --> 01:18:19,446
Now play it again.

1164
01:18:19,546 --> 01:18:22,777

Okay.

That's good.

Yeah. I recorded a few songs.

Oh, yeah? What are they like?

They're good.
I'm happy with them.

1169

Great.

1170
01:18:32,295 --> 01:18:34,293
I've missed you.

1171
01:18:34,393 --> 01:18:36,527
Yeah, me, too.

1172
01:18:36,627 --> 01:18:39,113
Do you want me
to meet you at the airport?

1173
01:18:39,213 --> 01:18:40,747
No. I'll come find you.

1174

(children shouting)

1175
01:18:42,547 --> 01:18:45,267
I'm glad you've decided to come.

1176
01:18:47,647 --> 01:18:50,447
Listen, I'm going
to get cut off here, all right?

1177
01:18:50,547 --> 01:18:52,728
Money's running out.

1178
01:18:52,828 --> 01:18:54,246
Hurry up.

(baby fussing)

1190
01:19:46,914 --> 01:19:48,946
You don't know
where she is, do you?

01:19:49,046 --> 01:19:50,246
Uh, she's-she's working.

Uh... Sorry.

1198

1199
01:20:02,847 --> 01:20:04,013
No telephone here, no.

1200
01:20:04,113 --> 01:20:05,280
Damn.

Yeah, sure.

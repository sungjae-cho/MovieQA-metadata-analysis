1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,074


2
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,813
Good piece of land.

3
00:04:30,461 --> 00:04:31,746
It was.

4
00:04:32,841 --> 00:04:33,848
Still is.

5
00:04:36,722 --> 00:04:37,805
Travis is calling you.

6
00:04:45,731 --> 00:04:47,093
Do I know you?

7
00:04:49,021 --> 00:04:50,431
Well, ought to.

8
00:04:53,022 --> 00:04:56,158
How did you lose that arm there, boy?

9
00:04:56,612 --> 00:05:00,458
Woke up in Chickamauga
one morning without it.

10
00:05:02,201 --> 00:05:04,608
Somebody deal you a losing hand there ...

11
00:05:06,043 --> 00:05:07,011
... Buckaboo?

12
00:05:12,923 --> 00:05:13,767
Jack?

13
00:05:14,922 --> 00:05:17,971
Now tell me, you found yourself
a one-titty woman ...

14
00:05:18,343 --> 00:05:21,873
... or you just take that one hand there
and whip it back and forth?

15
00:05:32,275 --> 00:05:33,762
Oh, my Lord.

16
00:05:35,115 --> 00:05:36,880
Get on down here!

17
00:05:43,957 --> 00:05:45,971
The hero has returned!

18
00:05:47,756 --> 00:05:49,405
Good to see you, Jack.

19
00:05:55,596 --> 00:05:57,159
Good to see you back!

20
00:06:01,636 --> 00:06:04,292
- It's me, Brian Brown.
- You remember Brian.

21
00:06:04,605 --> 00:06:06,494
You got whiskers now, boy!

22
00:06:06,726 --> 00:06:08,539
Ever think you'd see him again?

23
00:06:19,287 --> 00:06:21,858
Whoa there, boy. What's after you?

24
00:06:22,918 --> 00:06:23,685
Your husband.

25
00:06:23,958 --> 00:06:25,847
Who? What did you say?

26
00:06:26,628 --> 00:06:28,996
- He's coming, ma'am.
- Who?

27
00:06:31,629 --> 00:06:32,923
Mr. Sommersby.

28
00:06:56,739 --> 00:06:58,226
Get in the house!

29
00:06:58,661 --> 00:07:00,665
Come on! Come on!

30
00:07:08,171 --> 00:07:09,101
Look at you!

31
00:07:09,341 --> 00:07:10,703
You old man, now look!

32
00:07:10,961 --> 00:07:14,817
By God, there's another good man
the damn Yankees didn't get!

33
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:17,993
Come on over here and say hello to Will.

34
00:07:20,272 --> 00:07:23,398
Look here who I got here.
Jack Sommersby.

35
00:07:25,562 --> 00:07:28,410
They sent him back to me like that
from Vicksburg.

36
00:07:29,442 --> 00:07:31,734
Will's a hero.
Ain't that right, son?

37
00:07:32,072 --> 00:07:33,482
Well, well, well.

38
00:07:36,453 --> 00:07:38,102
Welcome home, Jack.

39
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:40,358
We thank the Lord you're back.

40
00:07:40,623 --> 00:07:41,946
Thank you, sir.

41
00:07:45,543 --> 00:07:48,353
Is Laurel all right?

42
00:07:48,923 --> 00:07:51,493
She's going to be surprised now, ain't she?

43
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:54,614
Six years is a long time without any word.

44
00:07:55,933 --> 00:07:57,535
Come on, where is he now?

45
00:08:02,775 --> 00:08:05,863
Look at you!
You look like a sack of bones.

46
00:08:08,734 --> 00:08:12,379
Kind of hard to get Esther dumplings
where I've been.

47
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:20,467
Oh, Lord, Mr. Jack.
You're home, you're home!

48
00:08:36,348 --> 00:08:38,994
Everybody here is missing somebody.

49
00:08:39,347 --> 00:08:42,195
Both Ezzel boys and their daddy got killed ...

50
00:08:42,607 --> 00:08:45,129
... and everybody that ain't dead is leaving.

51
00:08:45,436 --> 00:08:47,364
This town finished, Mr. Jack.

52
00:08:47,647 --> 00:08:51,378
Ain't nothing left here but hard ground
and nobody to work it.

53
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:33,785
Go say hello to your daddy, son.

54
00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:36,934
Go on now.

55
00:09:52,681 --> 00:09:54,090
Hello, Robert.

56
00:10:23,582 --> 00:10:26,555
I'd forgotten how beautiful you were.

57
00:10:44,656 --> 00:10:45,500
Jethro!

58
00:10:46,155 --> 00:10:47,440
Hey, boy!

59
00:11:01,415 --> 00:11:05,386
I hear in old town, Clemmons' pig
will be swallowing a stick tonight!

60
00:11:10,466 --> 00:11:13,363
I was down there in the weeds, kind of waiting ...

61
00:11:13,685 --> 00:11:16,725
... for the damn smoke
to get blowed away.

62
00:11:17,939 --> 00:11:20,826
And the next thing I know ...
Thank you, darling.

63
00:11:21,779 --> 00:11:25,183
Next thing I know,
there's this big old rifle butt ...

64
00:11:25,566 --> 00:11:29,259
... floating down out of the sky,
just kind of taking its time ...

65
00:11:29,698 --> 00:11:32,585
... like I had all day to get away from it.

66
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:37,522
When I come to, I was on my way to prison in Elmira.

67
00:11:37,828 --> 00:11:39,477
I heard that was the worst one.

68
00:11:40,629 --> 00:11:43,074
I couldn't even remember my name at that point.

69
00:11:44,509 --> 00:11:46,839
What did you do to your hand there, Jack?

70
00:11:47,178 --> 00:11:49,701
A guard stomped on it.

71
00:11:50,509 --> 00:11:52,437
Don't hold things too good now.

72
00:11:52,769 --> 00:11:54,371
You can still hold
a straight flush?

73
00:11:55,191 --> 00:11:57,800
And other things that are important.

74
00:11:58,271 --> 00:11:59,566
What did you do in prison?

75
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:03,564
Starved, froze, like everybody else.

76
00:12:35,023 --> 00:12:36,625
Evening, folks.

77
00:12:36,943 --> 00:12:39,590
Better take some of this while you can.

78
00:12:40,862 --> 00:12:42,790
I guess you don't remember me, sir.

79
00:12:46,493 --> 00:12:47,260
Joseph.

80
00:12:49,243 --> 00:12:51,295
Yes, I do remember!

81
00:12:51,703 --> 00:12:54,234
My daddy paid $ 100 for you.

82
00:12:54,544 --> 00:12:55,465
Yes, sir.

83
00:12:55,795 --> 00:12:58,039
Why don't you come on in now?

84
00:13:02,634 --> 00:13:03,756
No, thank you, sir.

85
00:13:04,052 --> 00:13:07,179
We just come by here
to say welcome home.

86
00:13:11,346 --> 00:13:15,278
Quit wasting time! Get yourself
over here. We got a present for you.

87
00:13:16,104 --> 00:13:17,753
- What do you got?
- Panther piss.

88
00:13:18,064 --> 00:13:21,152
- I ain't seen you pass water all night.
- Can't do it.

89
00:13:21,566 --> 00:13:24,021
One sip, I'm staggering like a new calf.

90
00:13:24,327 --> 00:13:26,014
You're still a rebel, ain't you?

91
00:13:26,326 --> 00:13:28,531
Best not get too friendly
with the niggers.

92
00:13:28,825 --> 00:13:30,072
We had to chase some off.

93
00:13:30,326 --> 00:13:32,416
That one has been
living on your land.

94
00:13:32,707 --> 00:13:36,351
Next thing you know,
they'll be moving into the big house.

95
00:13:40,627 --> 00:13:42,603
What's the matter with you?

96
00:13:44,297 --> 00:13:45,227
Nothing.

97
00:13:45,638 --> 00:13:48,083
You ain't acting yourself, Jack.

98
00:13:50,887 --> 00:13:54,061
What'd them goddamn Yankees
do to you, boy?

99
00:13:57,318 --> 00:13:58,805
Hit me on my head.

100
00:14:05,119 --> 00:14:06,720
- I love you.
- I love you too.

101
00:14:06,988 --> 00:14:09,203
Sit down.
I'm going to dance with my wife.

102
00:14:34,151 --> 00:14:35,196
Good to see you.

103
00:14:35,442 --> 00:14:36,410
Welcome back!

104
00:14:38,731 --> 00:14:40,706
Grab a gal here and shake a leg.

105
00:14:41,441 --> 00:14:44,251
I tend to hop a little bit better
than I shake now.

106
00:14:44,661 --> 00:14:48,583
Dick made me a good foot, though.
Got everything but toes that wiggle.

107
00:14:48,951 --> 00:14:50,639
Ain't got no toes ...

108
00:14:50,911 --> 00:14:52,647
... to worry about stomping them.

109
00:14:54,671 --> 00:14:58,037
Well, be careful you don't
catch a chill, Miss Laurel.

110
00:14:59,463 --> 00:15:01,439
Y'all have a good time.

111
00:15:03,093 --> 00:15:04,225
Shall we?

112
00:15:11,773 --> 00:15:13,461
Good night now, Buckaboo.

113
00:15:25,455 --> 00:15:29,099
You know where that handkerchief is
I brought home?

114
00:15:29,872 --> 00:15:32,280
It was filthy.
I told her to burn it.

115
00:15:32,753 --> 00:15:33,722
Damn!

116
00:15:34,965 --> 00:15:37,573
Hate to lose that thing.

117
00:15:39,174 --> 00:15:41,380
Carried that nearly six years.

118
00:15:41,844 --> 00:15:42,975
Why?

119
00:15:44,175 --> 00:15:46,630
The last thing you gave me
before I left.

120
00:16:00,156 --> 00:16:01,480
What happened here?

121
00:16:02,328 --> 00:16:03,498
Yankees.

122
00:16:03,866 --> 00:16:08,517
They got the silver, the carpets and
mostly anything else they could carry.

123
00:16:08,995 --> 00:16:11,565
I did save Granny's brooch, though ...

124
00:16:13,128 --> 00:16:15,813
... by sitting on it,
in a manner of speaking.

125
00:16:22,886 --> 00:16:25,610
That's where you were sleeping
before you left.

126
00:16:27,439 --> 00:16:28,686
Good night.

127
00:16:29,188 --> 00:16:30,473
Good night.

128
00:17:25,242 --> 00:17:27,850
I swore, if I ever made it home ...

129
00:17:30,002 --> 00:17:31,488
... I'd shave this thing off.

130
00:17:35,053 --> 00:17:36,299
Would you do it for me?

131
00:17:44,473 --> 00:17:45,921
Are you sure?

132
00:17:48,312 --> 00:17:49,722
Am I home?

133
00:17:50,522 --> 00:17:51,769
All right.

134
00:17:54,113 --> 00:17:56,722
That's the first thing
I remember about you.

135
00:17:57,153 --> 00:18:01,200
Coming back that time from
wherever you'd been, looking all ...

136
00:18:01,823 --> 00:18:03,712
... brown and bearded.

137
00:18:03,994 --> 00:18:07,245
Looking more like some kind
of a wild animal than a man.

138
00:18:11,795 --> 00:18:13,282
Is that what you wanted?

139
00:18:14,135 --> 00:18:15,458
Something wild?

140
00:18:16,256 --> 00:18:17,387
Maybe.

141
00:18:18,096 --> 00:18:20,024
Maybe just something a little ...

142
00:18:20,515 --> 00:18:21,838
... dangerous ...

143
00:18:22,094 --> 00:18:23,466
... a little different.

144
00:18:24,685 --> 00:18:26,056
A little rich?

145
00:18:27,936 --> 00:18:31,350
Make $900 and lose 1,000,
you are not rich.

146
00:18:36,316 --> 00:18:38,129
It was never the money.

147
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:52,832
Couldn't have been love ...

148
00:18:53,378 --> 00:18:54,510
... could it?

149
00:18:58,719 --> 00:19:00,167
It could have been.

150
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:09,499
If you'd been the least ...

151
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:12,278
... little bit ...

152
00:19:12,738 --> 00:19:13,860
... kind.

153
00:19:31,762 --> 00:19:33,363
What do you think?

154
00:19:36,259 --> 00:19:37,986
I'm thinking ...

155
00:19:38,891 --> 00:19:41,815
... who is this man
sitting in my kitchen?

156
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:53,983
Well, good night.

157
00:19:54,651 --> 00:19:55,783
Good night.

158
00:19:59,071 --> 00:20:03,042
I guess we have to get used
to each other again, don't we?

159
00:20:03,412 --> 00:20:04,822
I guess so.

160
00:20:20,644 --> 00:20:21,651
Well ...

161
00:20:28,903 --> 00:20:30,111
Good night.

162
00:20:31,694 --> 00:20:32,941
Good night.

163
00:21:15,076 --> 00:21:16,917
You're getting ahead of me again.

164
00:21:17,197 --> 00:21:18,693
Not quite.

165
00:21:20,576 --> 00:21:24,067
- So where is he?
- He wanted to see the farm.

166
00:21:24,958 --> 00:21:27,806
Hope he doesn't see too much.
He's liable to keep on riding.

167
00:21:28,127 --> 00:21:29,661
He wouldn't do that.

168
00:21:31,677 --> 00:21:33,519
But I have heard stories of men ...

169
00:21:33,799 --> 00:21:37,088
... who come home, and finding
their wives married again ...

170
00:21:37,558 --> 00:21:40,167
... and realizing it wasn't
nobody's fault ...

171
00:21:41,098 --> 00:21:44,474
- ...she'd fallen in love with ...
- Please! I'm sorry.

172
00:21:45,819 --> 00:21:47,948
I know you're hurting, and I wish ...

173
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:50,683
... that I was not the cause of it.

174
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:55,340
But we weren't married yet.
He's my husband and he's come home now.

175
00:21:56,619 --> 00:21:57,626
That's right.

176
00:22:00,662 --> 00:22:02,110
But if he ever ...

177
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:05,385
... lays a hand to you again,
I'll have to break it.

178
00:22:05,670 --> 00:22:07,521
Orin, please.

179
00:22:16,761 --> 00:22:17,815
Jethro!

180
00:22:25,313 --> 00:22:26,483
Jethro?

181
00:23:26,176 --> 00:23:27,298
Lord ...

182
00:23:27,835 --> 00:23:29,609
... take him to that better place ...

183
00:23:29,927 --> 00:23:34,175
... where the sun always shines,
and he'll have bigger fields to run in.

184
00:23:47,066 --> 00:23:48,399
What're you doing?

185
00:23:49,067 --> 00:23:51,321
Not too damn much.
What are you doing?

186
00:23:51,619 --> 00:23:53,182
Getting a little hoeing done.

187
00:23:53,908 --> 00:23:56,641
Yeah, well, you can take a break.

188
00:23:57,577 --> 00:23:59,466
Not going to be any cotton
here.

189
00:23:59,746 --> 00:24:02,077
I put a little bit of work
in these fields.

190
00:24:02,378 --> 00:24:06,588
You and about 40 more slaves,
maybe we'll get a crop in here.

191
00:24:08,257 --> 00:24:09,629
You calling me a nigger?

192
00:24:11,718 --> 00:24:13,329
Hell, Orin, I ain't ...

193
00:24:19,270 --> 00:24:21,361
I know what you done around here ...

194
00:24:21,650 --> 00:24:23,059
... and I appreciate it.

195
00:24:25,149 --> 00:24:27,278
What I've done,
I haven't done for you.

196
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,528
She's made her choice.

197
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:33,056
She had no choice.

198
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:40,775
If it'd gone the other way,
if she wanted you ...

199
00:24:42,170 --> 00:24:45,853
... I don't think I would've hung
around here, watched.

200
00:24:46,631 --> 00:24:47,436
Not me.

201
00:24:52,102 --> 00:24:54,749
But you never were one
to hang around, were you?

202
00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:03,601
I told Orin I'd marry him next year
if you didn't come back.

203
00:25:06,194 --> 00:25:09,406
He's put a lot of hard work in here,
and we owe him.

204
00:25:09,742 --> 00:25:11,631
I want you to be nice to him.

205
00:25:12,621 --> 00:25:15,345
You've got to try
and put yourself in his shoes.

206
00:25:15,703 --> 00:25:16,796
Shoe?

207
00:25:17,203 --> 00:25:21,778
Come on, now. It's hard for him
getting this close and all ...

208
00:25:24,464 --> 00:25:27,235
He ever get this close to you?

209
00:25:29,134 --> 00:25:30,707
I guess he did.

210
00:25:35,514 --> 00:25:36,809
Did he kiss you?

211
00:25:38,144 --> 00:25:39,237
He didn't?

212
00:25:47,234 --> 00:25:48,529
Did you want him to?

213
00:25:50,204 --> 00:25:51,489
I don't know.

214
00:25:51,865 --> 00:25:53,159
Don't know?

215
00:26:01,666 --> 00:26:03,200
Did he want to kiss you?

216
00:26:03,715 --> 00:26:05,479
I guess he did.

217
00:26:07,097 --> 00:26:08,862
Let me get the sugar.

218
00:26:11,516 --> 00:26:14,201
All right. Why didn't he?

219
00:26:15,106 --> 00:26:17,628
Because I never said that he could.

220
00:26:18,188 --> 00:26:19,521
You say he couldn't?

221
00:26:23,488 --> 00:26:25,895
Let me get this straight.
He wanted to ...

222
00:26:26,568 --> 00:26:28,697
... but you didn't know, so ...

223
00:26:28,988 --> 00:26:31,357
... he didn't ask and you didn't say.

224
00:26:31,829 --> 00:26:34,197
So he didn't and you weren't.

225
00:26:34,829 --> 00:26:37,639
But he's not here and I am,
and I want to.

226
00:26:39,667 --> 00:26:41,240
So I'm going to go ask.

227
00:26:41,509 --> 00:26:44,712
- Where're you going?
- To ask Orin if I can kiss my wife.

228
00:26:46,009 --> 00:26:46,940
Stop it!

229
00:26:51,808 --> 00:26:54,819
You got a very beautiful
smile there, Mrs. Sommersby.

230
00:26:56,310 --> 00:26:58,161
Hope to see a whole lot more of it.

231
00:26:59,441 --> 00:27:01,455
Well, you will.

232
00:27:24,722 --> 00:27:26,323
Where'd you find that?

233
00:27:28,221 --> 00:27:29,506
It was in the trunk.

234
00:27:30,972 --> 00:27:32,104
You remember?

235
00:27:32,643 --> 00:27:36,095
You sewed this the whole first month
we were married, didn't you?

236
00:27:37,022 --> 00:27:39,266
When I tried it on, it was too small.

237
00:27:39,562 --> 00:27:41,538
You threw it in there and said ...

238
00:27:41,822 --> 00:27:44,823
... you'd never sew again.
I don't think you ever did.

239
00:27:45,204 --> 00:27:46,729
How'd you remember that?

240
00:27:46,993 --> 00:27:50,397
Well, I forgot a whole lot
of important things.

241
00:27:51,373 --> 00:27:52,783
Other ones ...

242
00:27:53,542 --> 00:27:56,064
... never leave my mind, never will.

243
00:27:59,383 --> 00:28:01,991
- What're you doing?
- Come on, arms up.

244
00:28:02,383 --> 00:28:05,548
Been in a trunk for nine years.
It needs some washing.

245
00:28:15,024 --> 00:28:16,750
You remember making our son?

246
00:28:18,234 --> 00:28:19,682
The night it happened?

247
00:28:22,406 --> 00:28:23,969
You were drunk.

248
00:28:28,865 --> 00:28:30,879
Well, I'm sorry.

249
00:28:32,996 --> 00:28:36,487
Seems like after that, you never much
wanted me anymore.

250
00:28:40,716 --> 00:28:43,602
Seems a whole lot different now.

251
00:28:48,599 --> 00:28:50,488
You want to sleep in the other room?

252
00:29:00,359 --> 00:29:01,135
Good.

253
00:29:47,741 --> 00:29:48,911
What's wrong?

254
00:29:55,422 --> 00:29:58,711
I just don't remember
how I was with you.

255
00:30:00,172 --> 00:30:01,428
How to be.

256
00:30:05,513 --> 00:30:07,565
You don't have to remember that.

257
00:30:10,061 --> 00:30:11,145
Jack ...

258
00:30:17,234 --> 00:30:18,682
Say it again.

259
00:30:56,406 --> 00:30:57,653
Hey, boy!

260
00:30:58,695 --> 00:31:00,143
Let's go to town, get shoes!

261
00:31:01,486 --> 00:31:03,020
Do I have to?

262
00:31:03,327 --> 00:31:06,415
No, you can stay here and help me
shovel out the chicken coop.

263
00:31:15,678 --> 00:31:17,884
Where in the world are we going?

264
00:31:25,977 --> 00:31:27,904
Mama don't let me drive.

265
00:31:29,189 --> 00:31:31,318
I guess we got to mind Mama,
don't we?

266
00:31:32,279 --> 00:31:33,526
Say, ''hah.''

267
00:31:36,738 --> 00:31:37,908
Say it louder.

268
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:42,749
Don't say it to me, boy.
Say it to him.

269
00:31:48,748 --> 00:31:49,880
Say it again.

270
00:31:52,170 --> 00:31:53,215
Morning!

271
00:31:54,549 --> 00:31:55,958
Move around there.

272
00:32:03,930 --> 00:32:05,340
You're real good, boy!

273
00:32:05,641 --> 00:32:06,734
Thank you, sir.

274
00:32:07,690 --> 00:32:11,018
There's a lot of dead men's
footprints on this wall.

275
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:15,369
That's the one I'm looking for.

276
00:32:18,363 --> 00:32:21,652
I'm truly glad you
didn't follow them, Jack.

277
00:32:23,412 --> 00:32:26,500
You'll look just fine
once you get your lips back.

278
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,765
Let me have that foot.

279
00:32:29,582 --> 00:32:32,670
There's something about whiskers
that makes a man's lips ...

280
00:32:33,002 --> 00:32:34,652
... just shrink right on up.

281
00:32:39,682 --> 00:32:40,727
I'll be damned!

282
00:32:40,973 --> 00:32:42,737
Your foot shrunk!

283
00:32:45,102 --> 00:32:46,752
Foot's two sizes smaller now.

284
00:32:49,394 --> 00:32:50,765
That ain't mine.

285
00:32:52,313 --> 00:32:53,684
You must've been drunk.

286
00:32:53,944 --> 00:32:56,438
See? I wrote your name
right here at the bottom.

287
00:32:56,784 --> 00:32:59,507
How do you suppose
that could have happened?

288
00:33:02,702 --> 00:33:04,188
You know what I see?

289
00:33:05,744 --> 00:33:08,161
I see the future. Right there.

290
00:33:08,754 --> 00:33:10,164
Tobacco?!

291
00:33:10,505 --> 00:33:12,433
You mean smoking it, or growing it?

292
00:33:13,334 --> 00:33:15,271
You can't grow it this far north.

293
00:33:15,884 --> 00:33:18,531
- Too cold!
- Yes, you can. Yes, you can.

294
00:33:18,845 --> 00:33:20,130
It's called burley.

295
00:33:20,725 --> 00:33:22,452
They want it and we can grow it.

296
00:33:22,766 --> 00:33:27,331
You ever planted anything in the field
except your foot up somebody's backside?

297
00:33:29,565 --> 00:33:34,168
I don't think I have, but I didn't shoot
my first man before I had to, either.

298
00:33:36,906 --> 00:33:38,997
Now, you want to hear
what I have to say?

299
00:33:40,206 --> 00:33:41,174
All right.

300
00:33:42,207 --> 00:33:43,569
Here's what I'm offering.

301
00:33:44,498 --> 00:33:48,152
I'll give you all a piece of my land,
each and every one of you.

302
00:33:48,506 --> 00:33:50,385
I'll give you tools, fertilizer ...

303
00:33:51,336 --> 00:33:54,222
... and you keep half of the crop
when it comes in.

304
00:33:54,678 --> 00:33:57,564
I'll take my share
and pay off the mortgage against me.

305
00:33:58,007 --> 00:33:59,705
When the title clears ...

306
00:34:00,389 --> 00:34:02,959
... you can buy that land you worked,
for a fair price.

307
00:34:04,767 --> 00:34:07,097
Are you talking about
selling your own land?

308
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:10,451
Your daddy would've died first.

309
00:34:10,819 --> 00:34:12,622
He did, didn't he?

310
00:34:16,277 --> 00:34:19,452
How long you been sharecropping?
Ten years?

311
00:34:19,909 --> 00:34:24,081
15 years! You ever get a chance to
buy that land you've been working?

312
00:34:25,498 --> 00:34:26,390
Hell, no!

313
00:34:26,710 --> 00:34:29,117
Hell, no. This is it.
This is your chance, boy.

314
00:34:29,419 --> 00:34:30,512
Take it!

315
00:34:32,421 --> 00:34:35,077
What about y'all? You want in?

316
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:37,855
I'm not helping niggers.

317
00:34:38,099 --> 00:34:40,947
You're saying that those
who work the land ...

318
00:34:41,470 --> 00:34:42,927
I can't hear you!

319
00:34:43,441 --> 00:34:46,165
You're saying those
who work the land get to buy it?

320
00:34:47,110 --> 00:34:48,233
Yes, sir!

321
00:34:48,481 --> 00:34:50,169
That means coloreds and all?

322
00:34:54,650 --> 00:34:56,300
Nobody squats on my land.

323
00:34:56,572 --> 00:35:00,062
You want to stay, you got to pay for it
just like everybody else.

324
00:35:00,412 --> 00:35:03,337
I ain't living next to no nigras!

325
00:35:05,002 --> 00:35:05,846
You ain't, no?

326
00:35:06,041 --> 00:35:07,047
No, I'm not.

327
00:35:08,291 --> 00:35:11,379
Where're you going to live, then?
In the poorhouse?

328
00:35:11,752 --> 00:35:13,249
I'd just as soon!

329
00:35:13,554 --> 00:35:15,078
We take care of our own!

330
00:35:15,553 --> 00:35:17,404
You going to take care of her?

331
00:35:17,683 --> 00:35:21,529
Do that. You go work your fields
12 hours and then work hers.

332
00:35:21,933 --> 00:35:23,746
- I got a question.
- Go ahead.

333
00:35:24,063 --> 00:35:25,751
Tobacco seed.

334
00:35:26,234 --> 00:35:30,684
We all know it's worth about
2,000 times its weight in gold.

335
00:35:31,273 --> 00:35:32,290
You got no cash.

336
00:35:33,194 --> 00:35:34,805
You got no collateral.

337
00:35:35,075 --> 00:35:37,443
Your house, your land,
that's all mortgaged.

338
00:35:37,784 --> 00:35:39,875
You don't have tools,
not even a mule.

339
00:35:40,164 --> 00:35:42,533
Where you going to get money
for tobacco seed?

340
00:35:43,914 --> 00:35:45,324
That's God's own truth.

341
00:35:45,795 --> 00:35:49,641
Thank you for bringing that up.
Appreciate your concern and confidence.

342
00:35:49,965 --> 00:35:51,413
I was getting around to that.

343
00:35:51,714 --> 00:35:53,009
We're waiting to hear that.

344
00:35:53,965 --> 00:35:56,775
Is the seed going to
fall out of the sky, Jack?

345
00:35:57,886 --> 00:35:59,583
Hell, we're all ...

346
00:36:00,267 --> 00:36:02,799
We're all sitting on
a little something.

347
00:36:09,906 --> 00:36:12,150
There's nothing you
can do with that thing.

348
00:36:12,407 --> 00:36:16,416
But just maybe, we put all
of those little things together ...

349
00:36:16,826 --> 00:36:18,198
... we got something then.

350
00:36:20,456 --> 00:36:22,825
Maybe we can get started.
All of us.

351
00:36:23,167 --> 00:36:27,214
There's something we can do.
I don't know any other way to do this.

352
00:36:27,838 --> 00:36:30,811
I got Confederate money
in the outhouse. You want it?

353
00:36:31,139 --> 00:36:35,339
I don't see any way out of this
except what I'm saying now.

354
00:36:35,719 --> 00:36:39,574
- Want me to sell my other arm?
- Buck, listen to me now.

355
00:36:44,227 --> 00:36:46,241
I got a ruby brooch worth $ 1,000.

356
00:36:48,530 --> 00:36:51,656
It's been in my family for 100 years,
but I can't eat it.

357
00:36:51,990 --> 00:36:53,754
And neither can my family.

358
00:36:54,368 --> 00:36:58,856
Anybody got a better idea than Jack's?
I'd sure like to keep my brooch.

359
00:37:00,670 --> 00:37:05,398
Maybe y'all think I'm doing this
because he's my husband. You're wrong.

360
00:37:07,010 --> 00:37:11,652
This is not just some idea to put
cash back in Jack Sommersby's pocket.

361
00:37:13,891 --> 00:37:15,819
This is for all of us.

362
00:37:21,022 --> 00:37:25,031
It sounds to me like this idea
just might go, don't you think?

363
00:37:27,531 --> 00:37:28,739
I think so.

364
00:37:31,611 --> 00:37:33,740
I think we don't have any other option.

365
00:37:41,833 --> 00:37:43,166
Thank you, John.

366
00:37:46,341 --> 00:37:49,822
- Pretty pitiful chicken scratching.
- Not bad for your left.

367
00:37:50,133 --> 00:37:51,667
Well, it is me.

368
00:37:52,383 --> 00:37:56,392
- I hope you can get something for it.
- We'll get a lot of seeds for that.

369
00:38:03,144 --> 00:38:06,040
That's beautiful. You won't regret it.

370
00:38:07,075 --> 00:38:09,444
I'm regretting this already.

371
00:38:18,375 --> 00:38:20,466
All right. What we got here?

372
00:38:22,165 --> 00:38:24,658
Look at that!
Never seen nothing like that before.

373
00:38:25,216 --> 00:38:28,380
My grandmother's daddy gave it to her
the day she married.

374
00:38:28,756 --> 00:38:30,847
He was a toolmaker for her people.

375
00:38:31,677 --> 00:38:34,851
- How many acres you want to work?
- I thought about 10, sir.

376
00:38:35,186 --> 00:38:38,907
- Ten. Ten, it is.
- Say there we get to buy it?

377
00:38:44,447 --> 00:38:46,653
You will be coming back,
won't you, sir?

378
00:38:54,537 --> 00:38:55,381
Godspeed, Jack.

379
00:38:55,578 --> 00:38:56,710
Thank you, sir.

380
00:38:56,997 --> 00:38:58,282
God love you.

381
00:39:01,297 --> 00:39:02,697
Mind your mama.

382
00:39:34,159 --> 00:39:35,731
This is real sharp.

383
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:40,334
Thank you, son.

384
00:39:41,290 --> 00:39:42,748
I'll make a good trade for it.

385
00:39:44,421 --> 00:39:45,553
Bye, sir.

386
00:40:01,653 --> 00:40:03,417
Walk on, there! Walk on.

387
00:40:05,032 --> 00:40:06,279
Home soon!

388
00:40:20,753 --> 00:40:23,966
You folks will take that side.
We'll take this side.

389
00:40:24,343 --> 00:40:25,110
Let's go to work!

390
00:40:26,013 --> 00:40:28,219
We have two paces right here.

391
00:40:29,934 --> 00:40:31,458
Mark your way down, John?

392
00:40:33,104 --> 00:40:34,312
Go take it over there.

393
00:40:34,565 --> 00:40:36,770
... eight, nine, ten!

394
00:40:52,745 --> 00:40:56,916
Try not to be hoeing the rocks.
Make my job a little bit easier.

395
00:41:27,948 --> 00:41:30,594
The ground's about ready.
We have to plant soon ...

396
00:41:30,907 --> 00:41:32,480
He'll be here.

397
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:35,742
Yes, ma'am.

398
00:41:36,248 --> 00:41:38,377
How do we know if something is true?

399
00:41:39,958 --> 00:41:42,854
My Bible says:
"By their fruits ye shall know them."

400
00:41:43,178 --> 00:41:44,262
Amen.

401
00:41:44,588 --> 00:41:45,643
A good tree ...

402
00:41:46,179 --> 00:41:47,589
... bears good fruit.

403
00:41:47,929 --> 00:41:50,058
An evil tree, rotten.

404
00:41:51,559 --> 00:41:54,091
And you don't have to
wonder which it is.

405
00:41:55,189 --> 00:41:56,512
You just look ...

406
00:41:57,020 --> 00:41:58,516
... and you shall know.

407
00:42:01,030 --> 00:42:02,516
Good morning, Mrs. Bundy.

408
00:42:12,460 --> 00:42:13,947
Go, John. Ask her.

409
00:42:14,790 --> 00:42:16,123
Any news, Miss Laurel?

410
00:42:16,421 --> 00:42:17,629
No, not yet.

411
00:42:23,931 --> 00:42:25,935
Come on, Clarice.

412
00:42:32,772 --> 00:42:33,855
Here, boy.

413
00:42:35,063 --> 00:42:36,837
Where'd you come from?

414
00:42:43,031 --> 00:42:43,875
Sir.

415
00:42:46,824 --> 00:42:49,595
- Did you get a good price for my knife?
- Real good.

416
00:42:49,873 --> 00:42:52,356
So good, I had something
left over to buy him.

417
00:42:53,793 --> 00:42:56,123
Mom's going to be pleased to see you.

418
00:43:10,725 --> 00:43:11,732
Hello.

419
00:43:38,545 --> 00:43:40,195
Where you been?

420
00:43:44,716 --> 00:43:47,410
I had to go all the way to Virginia!

421
00:43:49,228 --> 00:43:50,954
But damn it, I got it!

422
00:43:52,938 --> 00:43:54,904
- Let's see it.
- Look at this.

423
00:44:06,958 --> 00:44:09,125
It don't look like much, does it?

424
00:44:09,417 --> 00:44:10,865
The seeds or me?

425
00:44:13,168 --> 00:44:14,856
Come on. Look at it.

426
00:44:15,549 --> 00:44:16,834
You look at it.

427
00:44:17,129 --> 00:44:18,424
Be careful now.

428
00:44:20,929 --> 00:44:22,579
Where have you been?

429
00:45:20,903 --> 00:45:23,358
Let's put these babies to bed now.

430
00:45:42,224 --> 00:45:44,113
I'm sorry. Did I hurt you?

431
00:45:51,685 --> 00:45:52,855
You all right?

432
00:46:01,405 --> 00:46:03,256
- I'll be damned.
- Look at that.

433
00:46:05,416 --> 00:46:07,104
Then Hector lifted ...

434
00:46:07,376 --> 00:46:09,505
... stout helmet and set it on his head.

435
00:46:09,835 --> 00:46:11,763
And like a star, it shone.

436
00:46:12,375 --> 00:46:14,667
And forth from its stand ...

437
00:46:15,387 --> 00:46:17,429
... he drew his father's spear ...

438
00:46:17,758 --> 00:46:19,091
... heavy, great ...

439
00:46:19,886 --> 00:46:21,373
... and strong.

440
00:46:23,267 --> 00:46:25,635
When's he going to shoot some Greeks?

441
00:46:28,307 --> 00:46:29,918
It's all the way back here.

442
00:47:16,450 --> 00:47:18,579
That'll be a good start for you.

443
00:47:43,063 --> 00:47:45,192
How you doing?
Is your back holding up?

444
00:48:15,385 --> 00:48:17,035
Should be further along by now.

445
00:48:17,595 --> 00:48:20,088
The ground's all give out from cotton.

446
00:48:20,516 --> 00:48:22,568
We got to fertilize them, boys.

447
00:48:48,127 --> 00:48:50,899
The whole damn house is falling apart.

448
00:48:54,346 --> 00:48:55,468
What?

449
00:48:56,097 --> 00:48:58,140
- Us.
- What about us?

450
00:48:58,928 --> 00:49:02,860
I was just thinking how we used to be,
all rich and stupid.

451
00:49:03,267 --> 00:49:04,802
Speak for yourself.

452
00:49:05,437 --> 00:49:07,527
Now this house is falling apart ...

453
00:49:07,818 --> 00:49:10,465
... we're broke
and I've never been so happy.

454
00:49:12,027 --> 00:49:14,952
You certainly have changed,
haven't you?

455
00:49:16,278 --> 00:49:17,487
For the better?

456
00:49:18,828 --> 00:49:21,791
So much better it scares me sometimes.

457
00:49:23,580 --> 00:49:25,632
You never used to read Homer.

458
00:49:31,628 --> 00:49:33,479
Yeah, well, there was a ...

459
00:49:34,841 --> 00:49:36,376
There was a man ...

460
00:49:37,180 --> 00:49:39,626
... I was penned up with in Elmira.

461
00:49:41,230 --> 00:49:42,995
He used to be a schoolteacher.

462
00:49:43,350 --> 00:49:45,162
He had this old ...

463
00:49:45,610 --> 00:49:47,576
... beat-up copy of Homer.

464
00:49:49,402 --> 00:49:51,051
He used to read it to us.

465
00:49:54,740 --> 00:49:56,264
Gave it to me.

466
00:49:59,082 --> 00:50:01,527
I took up the reading when he died.

467
00:50:05,252 --> 00:50:06,220
How did it happen?

468
00:50:09,172 --> 00:50:10,860
He just died, that's all.

469
00:50:20,011 --> 00:50:22,188
You don't have to talk about it.

470
00:50:47,335 --> 00:50:48,467
Snap it.

471
00:50:53,975 --> 00:50:55,336
Come here, little Jethro.

472
00:50:55,595 --> 00:50:57,206
See all these flowers here?

473
00:50:57,895 --> 00:50:59,976
Every one of them has got to go.

474
00:51:02,357 --> 00:51:03,920
Every single one of them.

475
00:51:05,606 --> 00:51:08,301
See these shoots?
You got to take them off too.

476
00:51:24,958 --> 00:51:28,209
I said to use the fertilizer
in the field, Jack.

477
00:51:37,888 --> 00:51:39,144
When is it coming?

478
00:51:39,399 --> 00:51:42,247
September, August maybe.

479
00:51:42,609 --> 00:51:46,052
Don't tell me you haven't known
about this for some time, missy.

480
00:51:46,397 --> 00:51:47,644
Yeah, maybe I did.

481
00:51:50,159 --> 00:51:52,000
Why didn't you tell me?

482
00:51:53,869 --> 00:51:56,755
Go on now.
I need to get some rest.

483
00:51:58,328 --> 00:52:00,534
Come on, Mr. Jack. Come on.

484
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:19,851
- Oh, sweet Jesus!
- What the hell is it?

485
00:52:20,140 --> 00:52:22,269
I believe it's a hornworm, sir.

486
00:52:24,940 --> 00:52:26,033
Hornworm?

487
00:52:28,532 --> 00:52:31,054
Look at this.
Crawling all over them.

488
00:52:31,362 --> 00:52:33,731
They going to eat us up, sir.

489
00:52:36,161 --> 00:52:37,533
You know what to do?

490
00:52:38,332 --> 00:52:39,617
No, sir.

491
00:52:41,043 --> 00:52:43,134
Maybe Mr. Orin know.

492
00:52:43,842 --> 00:52:45,770
- Damned if I'll ask him.
- You got to.

493
00:52:46,053 --> 00:52:47,453
I said no!

494
00:53:05,275 --> 00:53:06,483
Howdy. How are you?

495
00:53:06,984 --> 00:53:08,154
Not too damn good. You?

496
00:53:08,695 --> 00:53:11,946
Well, I think I'd be all right
if I could get some work.

497
00:53:12,285 --> 00:53:14,692
We got a field full of that,
don't we?

498
00:53:14,993 --> 00:53:17,084
This Jack Sommersby's place?

499
00:53:18,795 --> 00:53:19,917
Jack around?

500
00:53:56,247 --> 00:53:57,695
You want a piece of this?

501
00:53:57,957 --> 00:53:58,964
Get out!

502
00:54:27,318 --> 00:54:28,891
Who were those men?

503
00:54:30,990 --> 00:54:31,805
What men?

504
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:33,162
The men in the field.

505
00:54:34,830 --> 00:54:37,160
- I don't know.
- What did they want?

506
00:54:37,460 --> 00:54:38,352
Trouble.

507
00:54:38,591 --> 00:54:39,713
What kind of trouble?

508
00:54:39,959 --> 00:54:42,970
- God's sake! How many kinds are there?
- I saw you.

509
00:54:43,461 --> 00:54:44,718
- Forget it.
- But I saw you!

510
00:54:44,971 --> 00:54:46,257
I said forget about it!

511
00:54:46,551 --> 00:54:48,603
The goddamn worms are eating us!

512
00:54:48,930 --> 00:54:51,174
You want to worry,
worry about them!

513
00:55:16,711 --> 00:55:17,996
Hey, friend?

514
00:55:18,332 --> 00:55:20,902
You got some fresh water around here?

515
00:55:22,882 --> 00:55:23,966
- Howdy.
- Morning.

516
00:55:24,384 --> 00:55:25,755
Got any water?

517
00:55:27,013 --> 00:55:28,941
You look like you run into trouble.

518
00:55:40,903 --> 00:55:42,504
Heard you had a problem.

519
00:55:47,205 --> 00:55:49,928
You want to keep pulling them off
like you are ...

520
00:55:50,244 --> 00:55:52,133
... but then just go like this.

521
00:55:52,624 --> 00:55:55,914
I got a barrel at the end of the row.
Fill up from that ...

522
00:55:56,256 --> 00:56:00,418
... and then when you get done with that,
I can mix you up some more.

523
00:56:03,045 --> 00:56:04,455
That keeps them off?

524
00:56:06,765 --> 00:56:07,609
What's in there?

525
00:56:07,805 --> 00:56:10,337
- Why, it's soap, mostly.
- Soap?

526
00:56:10,767 --> 00:56:13,299
Hamilton Sayer gave me the recipe.

527
00:56:14,816 --> 00:56:17,376
He got that piece of land
over by the church.

528
00:56:17,685 --> 00:56:21,301
Yeah, I'll have to shake his hand
next time I see him.

529
00:56:25,157 --> 00:56:28,168
Why don't you take this
and I'll take that.

530
00:56:30,457 --> 00:56:33,698
Job ain't done till
they're all dead and buried.

531
00:56:36,089 --> 00:56:37,336
Thank you.

532
00:56:43,797 --> 00:56:46,405
- What's wrong?
- You tell her to get, first.

533
00:56:50,099 --> 00:56:51,393
Go on now, Esther.

534
00:56:58,569 --> 00:57:01,053
Six years I've worked this place ...

535
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:02,530
... for you.

536
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:06,013
Man comes here,
says he's your husband.

537
00:57:06,370 --> 00:57:07,894
You say I have to make way.

538
00:57:09,329 --> 00:57:10,576
I make it.

539
00:57:10,830 --> 00:57:14,196
I eat my heart like a piece
of spoiled meat, but I make way ...

540
00:57:14,540 --> 00:57:15,949
... for you.

541
00:57:16,670 --> 00:57:18,838
Then I run into these drifters ...

542
00:57:19,132 --> 00:57:21,539
... that just been at your place,
looking for work.

543
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:24,209
And one of them has got his neck cut.

544
00:57:25,432 --> 00:57:29,518
Said that somebody claiming to be
Jack Sommersby tried to kill him.

545
00:57:29,850 --> 00:57:33,974
I said: "Why'd he try to kill you?"
He said because he knew it wasn't Jack.

546
00:57:34,352 --> 00:57:37,842
Said he'd been with the real Jack
when he got his chest tore up ...

547
00:57:38,191 --> 00:57:40,560
... and this man didn't have
a mark on him.

548
00:57:40,863 --> 00:57:42,915
And just now, out in the field ...

549
00:57:43,242 --> 00:57:46,129
... he didn't know who Ham Sayer was.

550
00:57:46,411 --> 00:57:48,099
Best friend he ever had!

551
00:57:49,414 --> 00:57:51,304
Didn't know Ham Sayer.

552
00:57:53,254 --> 00:57:56,064
But you've known all along,
haven't you?

553
00:57:58,043 --> 00:58:01,016
He might've fooled us,
but he didn't fool you.

554
00:58:03,342 --> 00:58:04,714
Why, Laurel?

555
00:58:05,515 --> 00:58:07,040
Why'd you do it?

556
00:58:07,894 --> 00:58:10,061
Why'd you take him into your house?

557
00:58:10,393 --> 00:58:11,726
Into your bed?

558
00:58:12,394 --> 00:58:15,444
And why are you carrying
some stranger's child ...

559
00:58:15,733 --> 00:58:18,179
... when all I ever wanted
was to honor you?

560
00:58:21,733 --> 00:58:24,946
You are living in mortal sin,
Laurel Sommersby.

561
00:58:25,866 --> 00:58:27,161
Do you hear me?

562
00:58:27,455 --> 00:58:30,706
You and this child are
in danger of spending eternity ...

563
00:58:31,045 --> 00:58:32,608
... in everlasting damnation!

564
00:58:32,915 --> 00:58:34,804
- Get out!
- Come here.

565
00:58:36,046 --> 00:58:37,456
Come over here.

566
00:58:38,677 --> 00:58:40,087
See what these are?

567
00:58:40,426 --> 00:58:43,955
They are a sign of the rottenness
that is eating at this place!

568
00:58:44,346 --> 00:58:46,034
You get out!

569
00:58:46,935 --> 00:58:50,225
Take your lies and damnation with you!

570
00:58:59,866 --> 00:59:01,075
Look ...

571
00:59:01,367 --> 00:59:03,333
... and you will know.

572
00:59:27,390 --> 00:59:29,443
So who do you think I am?

573
00:59:37,699 --> 00:59:39,588
I'd like to know one thing.

574
00:59:42,121 --> 00:59:44,643
Whoever you think I am ...

575
00:59:46,330 --> 00:59:47,260
... do you love me?

576
00:59:47,708 --> 00:59:48,514
You're drunk.

577
00:59:48,789 --> 00:59:52,002
I'm drunk. That's not the point.
The point is ...

578
00:59:52,591 --> 00:59:55,353
... that I love you.
Now, do you love me?

579
00:59:55,711 --> 00:59:59,883
If you loved me, you would stop
this sinning and leave me alone!

580
01:00:00,220 --> 01:00:01,984
- I will not.
- Jack would.

581
01:00:02,221 --> 01:00:03,832
- Sure he would.
- Did you know him?

582
01:00:04,262 --> 01:00:08,635
Is he dead? For all I know,
you killed him and left him in a ditch.

583
01:00:09,062 --> 01:00:10,875
He's right here in front of you.

584
01:00:11,272 --> 01:00:13,564
A little banged-up maybe,
but I'm here.

585
01:00:13,861 --> 01:00:14,907
Stop it!

586
01:00:15,443 --> 01:00:16,210
Stop it!

587
01:00:16,443 --> 01:00:17,651
You'll wake the boy.

588
01:00:18,742 --> 01:00:20,267
You're making me crazy!

589
01:00:21,662 --> 01:00:22,947
You get out of this house!

590
01:00:44,055 --> 01:00:45,388
No, I ain't leaving.

591
01:00:48,774 --> 01:00:51,776
I'm home now.
I ain't going to leave again.

592
01:00:56,525 --> 01:00:58,654
You are not my husband.

593
01:01:08,336 --> 01:01:10,503
May God strike me dead ...

594
01:01:10,797 --> 01:01:12,446
... if I am not.

595
01:01:58,559 --> 01:02:00,439
I'd let it burn, sir!

596
01:02:09,021 --> 01:02:10,076
Who the hell are you?

597
01:02:10,320 --> 01:02:12,727
We are the
Knights of the White Camellia.

598
01:02:13,029 --> 01:02:16,318
We are God's hand
and He is our eyes ...

599
01:02:16,698 --> 01:02:17,984
... and we are His vengeance!

600
01:02:27,171 --> 01:02:27,977
Joseph!

601
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:30,089
Can you talk to me?

602
01:02:30,381 --> 01:02:31,627
You all right?

603
01:02:35,432 --> 01:02:36,717
Why was this man beaten?

604
01:02:37,013 --> 01:02:39,861
You have broken the law,
and he has paid for it.

605
01:02:40,222 --> 01:02:41,277
What law?

606
01:02:41,471 --> 01:02:45,480
- A nigger can't own land.
- By law, he can own what he pays for.

607
01:02:45,854 --> 01:02:47,148
Don't I know you?

608
01:02:48,692 --> 01:02:50,303
You're on my land, aren't you?

609
01:02:50,611 --> 01:02:53,460
Ain't you that teacher
from over in Clark County?

610
01:02:54,073 --> 01:02:57,400
You better cut bigger holes
in that sheet, mister ...

611
01:02:57,744 --> 01:02:59,269
... to see
who you're looking at.

612
01:02:59,533 --> 01:03:01,422
Your master ain't listening, nigger.

613
01:03:01,744 --> 01:03:04,755
Should I shoot you
to make him hear me?

614
01:03:05,124 --> 01:03:08,691
You got the gun.
You do what the hell you like!

615
01:03:14,803 --> 01:03:16,529
The war's over, boys.

616
01:03:17,474 --> 01:03:18,759
Don't do it.

617
01:03:22,725 --> 01:03:23,492
Stay back!

618
01:03:23,726 --> 01:03:26,258
If he don't let go of it,
shoot them both!

619
01:03:26,566 --> 01:03:27,697
I got him!

620
01:03:28,485 --> 01:03:30,096
I didn't come to kill no white man.

621
01:03:30,314 --> 01:03:32,050
Buck? What are you doing here?

622
01:03:33,235 --> 01:03:35,048
Shit! I told you!

623
01:03:44,876 --> 01:03:47,044
Get out of here! Get out!

624
01:04:09,527 --> 01:04:11,138
Is it still my land?

625
01:04:11,909 --> 01:04:13,357
You own what you pay for.

626
01:04:13,618 --> 01:04:15,220
Well, I'm paying.

627
01:04:17,288 --> 01:04:18,611
Go on now.

628
01:04:27,630 --> 01:04:31,840
I was scared! I thought they
were ghosts. Were you scared too?

629
01:04:32,218 --> 01:04:34,826
Yes, I was. I was truly scared.

630
01:04:35,179 --> 01:04:37,423
But you saw them. Just men.

631
01:04:38,640 --> 01:04:42,207
- Maybe they weren't even that.
- You mean they won't come back?

632
01:04:42,650 --> 01:04:45,575
Why would they come back?
We're not scared anymore.

633
01:04:45,940 --> 01:04:48,472
No, sir, we are not!

634
01:04:49,111 --> 01:04:51,605
You want to finish this story?
It's the part ...

635
01:04:51,911 --> 01:04:54,471
... where they going to
shoot those Greeks.

636
01:04:55,240 --> 01:04:57,935
I like this part too.
I'll read it to you.

637
01:04:59,082 --> 01:05:00,933
Now the Trojans ...

638
01:05:04,172 --> 01:05:08,900
... the Trojans, like ravening lions,
rushed upon the Greek ships ...

639
01:05:09,340 --> 01:05:11,546
... for the heart of Zeus
was with them ...

640
01:05:12,342 --> 01:05:15,871
... and their spirits filled
like sails in the morning.

641
01:05:18,682 --> 01:05:21,492
And the weariness
of their legs departed ...

642
01:05:22,642 --> 01:05:26,372
... and the mighty shields
grew light on their arms.

643
01:05:27,522 --> 01:05:31,099
And they knew that victory would be theirs.

644
01:05:43,122 --> 01:05:45,414
You killed that dog, didn't you?

645
01:05:46,924 --> 01:05:48,966
Poor old Jethro.

646
01:05:51,716 --> 01:05:53,653
He knew you for a stranger.

647
01:05:56,014 --> 01:05:57,903
So then you had to kill him.

648
01:06:01,564 --> 01:06:03,933
Nice torch.
Save it from last night?

649
01:06:05,066 --> 01:06:07,320
Who are you, you son of a bitch?

650
01:06:10,825 --> 01:06:13,635
Tell me who you are or
I'll burn this place down.

651
01:06:16,037 --> 01:06:17,322
I'm the man she wanted.

652
01:06:19,418 --> 01:06:20,943
You're a liar.

653
01:06:21,166 --> 01:06:22,374
You're a liar ...

654
01:06:22,668 --> 01:06:24,518
... and a thief is what you are.

655
01:06:24,796 --> 01:06:28,086
You are a goddamned yellow hypocrite
hiding under a sheet!

656
01:07:40,633 --> 01:07:41,755
Sir?

657
01:07:43,044 --> 01:07:44,780
Mama's having the baby.

658
01:08:01,193 --> 01:08:03,437
Congratulations, Mr. Jack.

659
01:08:03,693 --> 01:08:04,661
Thank you.

660
01:08:15,624 --> 01:08:16,554
What happened to ...?

661
01:08:16,795 --> 01:08:19,557
I fell off a ladder. I'm all right.

662
01:08:22,295 --> 01:08:23,628
Can I hold her?

663
01:08:37,475 --> 01:08:39,690
Let's call her Rachel,
after your mama.

664
01:08:47,197 --> 01:08:49,729
So do you think she knows
I'm her daddy?

665
01:08:50,747 --> 01:08:52,435
I'm sure she does.

666
01:09:40,381 --> 01:09:42,874
Looks like we have a fine crop.

667
01:10:17,670 --> 01:10:19,598
How's the smoke there, Reverend?

668
01:10:21,213 --> 01:10:22,786
Mighty smooth.

669
01:10:24,803 --> 01:10:26,730
How much you reckon we'll get?

670
01:10:27,051 --> 01:10:31,185
It depends. I'll be happy with
eight dollars on a hundred weight.

671
01:10:34,064 --> 01:10:36,471
Can I get you a new spire
on the church?

672
01:10:38,655 --> 01:10:41,062
Verily I say unto you ...

673
01:10:41,364 --> 01:10:44,893
... whosoever shall not receive
the kingdom of God ...

674
01:10:45,244 --> 01:10:47,085
... as a little child ...

675
01:10:47,365 --> 01:10:49,782
... he shall not enter therein.

676
01:10:51,416 --> 01:10:54,504
And He took them in His arms ...

677
01:10:58,546 --> 01:11:01,835
... put His hands upon them
and blessed them.

678
01:11:02,345 --> 01:11:03,994
Name this child.

679
01:11:04,264 --> 01:11:05,271
Rachel Caroline.

680
01:11:06,056 --> 01:11:09,547
Rachel Caroline, I baptize thee ...

681
01:11:10,185 --> 01:11:12,995
... in the name of the Father,
and the Son ...

682
01:11:13,516 --> 01:11:15,328
... and the Holy Ghost.

683
01:11:16,066 --> 01:11:17,351
Amen.

684
01:11:26,787 --> 01:11:29,117
- Nothing to do with me.
- You must be proud.

685
01:11:29,416 --> 01:11:31,459
John Robert Sommersby?

686
01:11:31,995 --> 01:11:32,763
Yes, sir.

687
01:11:33,666 --> 01:11:37,550
Federal marshals, Mr. Sommersby.
We have a warrant for your arrest.

688
01:11:38,298 --> 01:11:39,507
My arrest? For what?

689
01:11:40,299 --> 01:11:43,867
For the murder of Mr. Charles Conklin
of Jackson, Mississippi.

690
01:11:46,558 --> 01:11:49,367
- Five minutes, Mrs. Sommersby.
- Thank you.

691
01:12:02,071 --> 01:12:04,085
I want you to tell me.

692
01:12:04,490 --> 01:12:07,942
I don't care what the answer is,
I'll stay by you ...

693
01:12:08,787 --> 01:12:10,916
... as long as it's the truth.

694
01:12:13,791 --> 01:12:15,566
Did you do this?

695
01:12:19,470 --> 01:12:21,675
No, I did not.

696
01:12:26,353 --> 01:12:27,877
All right, then.

697
01:12:30,142 --> 01:12:31,916
I'll get our things together.

698
01:12:35,231 --> 01:12:36,918
We're coming with you, Jack!

699
01:12:37,651 --> 01:12:39,061
Thank you, John.

700
01:12:41,032 --> 01:12:43,842
They're so afraid,
they got to handcuff me.

701
01:12:44,122 --> 01:12:46,203
- I'll be back.
- You're a good man!

702
01:12:46,491 --> 01:12:48,467
- We're behind you!
- Take care!

703
01:12:48,752 --> 01:12:51,601
I always did have a hankering
to go see Nashville.

704
01:12:51,873 --> 01:12:53,408
Proud to have you with me.

705
01:12:55,003 --> 01:12:57,410
I wish I knew why you was
arresting this man!

706
01:12:57,714 --> 01:12:59,527
Stand clear! Federal marshals.

707
01:12:59,802 --> 01:13:03,811
God bless you, now.
You promise to come right back.

708
01:13:04,185 --> 01:13:05,786
I'll be back. We'll be back!

709
01:13:06,184 --> 01:13:08,668
We'll be with you in two days!
Don't you worry!

710
01:13:08,973 --> 01:13:11,304
We'll see you in Nashville, Jack!

711
01:14:10,167 --> 01:14:12,536
Did you bring the Acts of Assembly?

712
01:14:19,639 --> 01:14:21,087
All rise, please.

713
01:14:21,430 --> 01:14:25,362
Oyez, oyez. The Honorable
Barry Conrad Issacs is now sitting.

714
01:14:25,688 --> 01:14:27,376
This court shall come to order!

715
01:14:27,599 --> 01:14:31,492
All having suits to prosecute or
pleas to enter shall come forward ...

716
01:14:31,859 --> 01:14:33,509
... and they shall be heard.

717
01:14:47,959 --> 01:14:51,565
Well, we were playing
a game of five-card ...

718
01:14:51,880 --> 01:14:54,211
... and Charlie, Mr. Conklin ...

719
01:14:54,512 --> 01:14:57,437
... saw Sommersby slip a card
off the bottom of the deck.

720
01:14:57,721 --> 01:15:00,128
He jumped up
and called him a damn cheat.

721
01:15:00,511 --> 01:15:03,282
And what happened
when you got outside?

722
01:15:04,391 --> 01:15:08,121
Mr. Conklin hit Sommersby
in the stomach.

723
01:15:08,981 --> 01:15:11,389
He went down like a sack of potatoes.

724
01:15:12,861 --> 01:15:15,825
Then Sommersby got up
with a gun in his hand.

725
01:15:17,492 --> 01:15:20,417
Charlie hollered: "Don't shoot, Sommersby!"

726
01:15:22,283 --> 01:15:25,496
But he shot him like a dog,
and he run off.

727
01:15:25,833 --> 01:15:28,882
Now, is the man you refer to
as Sommersby ...

728
01:15:29,293 --> 01:15:31,105
... here in this courtroom?

729
01:15:34,134 --> 01:15:35,457
That's him.

730
01:15:38,595 --> 01:15:42,201
Let the record show
witness identified the defendant.

731
01:15:43,724 --> 01:15:46,458
I was standing on the corner
across the street.

732
01:15:46,774 --> 01:15:50,304
I couldn't see too well
because it was rather dark.

733
01:15:50,604 --> 01:15:51,573
And I saw ...

734
01:15:52,363 --> 01:15:55,768
... a man lying on the ground.
And then he gets up.

735
01:15:56,696 --> 01:15:58,949
And I see he has a gun in his hand.

736
01:16:00,364 --> 01:16:03,097
And I heard this other man say:

737
01:16:03,533 --> 01:16:05,787
"Don't shoot, Sommersby."

738
01:16:07,336 --> 01:16:08,582
And he shot him.

739
01:16:08,917 --> 01:16:11,084
And the man fell to the ground.

740
01:16:12,925 --> 01:16:15,409
"Don't shoot, Sommersby."

741
01:16:16,345 --> 01:16:17,554
Mr. Goldman ...

742
01:16:17,805 --> 01:16:19,810
... did you see him sign this register?

743
01:16:20,097 --> 01:16:20,902
Yes, sir.

744
01:16:22,396 --> 01:16:24,842
Is that his signature right there?

745
01:16:28,565 --> 01:16:30,934
Was there anything wrong with his hand?

746
01:16:32,857 --> 01:16:33,673
No, sir.

747
01:16:35,117 --> 01:16:37,879
The jury will observe
this hotel register ...

748
01:16:38,487 --> 01:16:41,421
... and the signature of J. Sommersby,
and compare it to ...

749
01:16:41,747 --> 01:16:44,519
... the signature on a bank mortgage ...

750
01:16:45,339 --> 01:16:48,667
... signed by Mr. Sommersby
seven years before.

751
01:16:49,589 --> 01:16:51,679
The signatures are identical.

752
01:16:56,850 --> 01:16:59,813
This court is adjourned
until 9 :00 tomorrow morning ...

753
01:17:00,139 --> 01:17:02,911
... when we'll hear arguments
for the defense.

754
01:17:05,060 --> 01:17:06,431
All rise.

755
01:17:09,530 --> 01:17:10,854
How'd we do?

756
01:17:11,439 --> 01:17:12,935
Did just fine, son.

757
01:17:13,360 --> 01:17:14,415
Mr. Sommersby ...

758
01:17:14,659 --> 01:17:16,222
... will you come with me?

759
01:17:43,771 --> 01:17:45,698
I know what you're thinking.

760
01:17:46,563 --> 01:17:48,577
Orin! What are you doing here?

761
01:17:48,942 --> 01:17:50,313
Watching over you.

762
01:17:50,653 --> 01:17:52,178
We don't need watching.

763
01:17:52,492 --> 01:17:56,213
The way things are going,
he's going to hang.

764
01:17:57,662 --> 01:17:59,504
I can make sure he don't.

765
01:18:01,294 --> 01:18:02,502
How?

766
01:18:10,004 --> 01:18:14,492
You got to tell them who you are.
If you do, they'll have to let you go.

767
01:18:16,724 --> 01:18:17,846
I can't.

768
01:18:18,095 --> 01:18:19,188
Yes, you can.

769
01:18:19,723 --> 01:18:21,775
Who am I supposed to say I am?

770
01:18:24,065 --> 01:18:25,513
Just who you are.

771
01:18:32,985 --> 01:18:34,318
Do you really want to know?

772
01:18:34,786 --> 01:18:35,956
Yes.

773
01:18:38,115 --> 01:18:39,007
Are you sure?

774
01:18:53,766 --> 01:18:54,974
I'm ...

775
01:18:56,308 --> 01:18:57,200
... Jack Sommersby.

776
01:18:59,767 --> 01:19:00,898
Pleased to meet you.

777
01:19:13,579 --> 01:19:14,384
What'd I do?

778
01:19:17,158 --> 01:19:19,134
You stubborn fool!

779
01:19:19,787 --> 01:19:21,561
I won't let you do this!

780
01:19:31,969 --> 01:19:33,733
I accept your offer.

781
01:19:34,757 --> 01:19:36,091
Mr. Webb?

782
01:19:36,720 --> 01:19:39,214
- Is the defense ready?
- Yes, Your Honor.

783
01:19:39,689 --> 01:19:42,614
The defense calls
as its first witness ...

784
01:19:42,899 --> 01:19:45,143
... Mrs. John Sommersby.

785
01:19:46,228 --> 01:19:48,079
Webb, what the hell is this?

786
01:19:48,360 --> 01:19:50,010
Place your left hand on the Bible.

787
01:19:50,280 --> 01:19:53,809
Do you swear to tell the truth
and nothing but the truth ...

788
01:19:54,161 --> 01:19:55,168
... so help you God?

789
01:19:55,700 --> 01:19:57,992
- Yes, I do.
- Please be seated.

790
01:20:04,042 --> 01:20:07,217
- Please tell us your name.
- Mrs. John Sommersby.

791
01:20:07,550 --> 01:20:11,799
Mrs. Sommersby, here are the hotel
register and the mortgage paper ...

792
01:20:12,182 --> 01:20:14,665
... the prosecution has submitted
as evidence.

793
01:20:15,013 --> 01:20:17,103
Do you recognize
the signatures there?

794
01:20:17,431 --> 01:20:19,397
Yes, they're my husband's.

795
01:20:20,391 --> 01:20:23,047
Can you point your husband out
to the court?

796
01:20:23,401 --> 01:20:24,964
No, I cannot.

797
01:20:26,404 --> 01:20:28,494
And why is that, ma'am?

798
01:20:29,573 --> 01:20:31,385
My husband is not
in this room.

799
01:20:34,243 --> 01:20:35,528
Objection!

800
01:20:35,742 --> 01:20:37,190
Objection!

801
01:20:37,833 --> 01:20:38,840
Come here, Webb!

802
01:20:39,544 --> 01:20:41,635
Your Honor, this is absurd!

803
01:20:43,584 --> 01:20:44,678
Silence!

804
01:20:51,095 --> 01:20:52,188
I'm talking to you!

805
01:20:52,515 --> 01:20:53,887
Sit down, sir!

806
01:20:54,644 --> 01:20:57,090
Don't do it.
You don't have to do it.

807
01:20:58,435 --> 01:21:00,247
Sit down
or I'll have you seated.

808
01:21:01,485 --> 01:21:05,167
Your Honor, this is a purely
theatrical device designed ...

809
01:21:05,526 --> 01:21:08,374
... to throw these proceedings
into confusion.

810
01:21:08,696 --> 01:21:10,547
Overruled, for the moment.

811
01:21:13,615 --> 01:21:18,027
Mrs. Sommersby, are you saying
the defendant is not your husband?

812
01:21:18,586 --> 01:21:20,907
As clearly as I can, Your Honor.

813
01:21:23,126 --> 01:21:26,300
Are you saying
the defendant is an impostor?

814
01:21:27,136 --> 01:21:27,942
Yes, I am.

815
01:21:28,888 --> 01:21:31,697
Your Honor, this is absurd!

816
01:21:32,387 --> 01:21:34,641
Quite possibly, Mr. Dawson.

817
01:21:35,227 --> 01:21:36,435
However ...

818
01:21:36,976 --> 01:21:39,661
... we cannot continue to try a man
for a capital crime ...

819
01:21:39,977 --> 01:21:41,991
... if he is not the man in question.

820
01:21:43,647 --> 01:21:45,498
Proceed, Mr. Webb.

821
01:21:46,357 --> 01:21:48,055
Thank you, Your Honor.

822
01:21:49,406 --> 01:21:53,377
And when did you realize
this man was not John Sommersby?

823
01:21:54,249 --> 01:21:57,490
It was the little things.
At first, he looked some different.

824
01:21:57,829 --> 01:21:59,958
But so did everybody back
from the war.

825
01:22:00,500 --> 01:22:05,276
He couldn't remember a lot of things.
His own dog didn't know him.

826
01:22:05,840 --> 01:22:08,487
A dog. It's a dog, y'all!

827
01:22:09,099 --> 01:22:10,068
Sustained.

828
01:22:12,970 --> 01:22:17,141
He never talked about his father,
and he'd been the world to Jack.

829
01:22:17,981 --> 01:22:19,113
Your Honor, please!

830
01:22:22,191 --> 01:22:24,924
Let's get our cows over their buckets.

831
01:22:25,400 --> 01:22:26,733
Please, continue.

832
01:22:28,410 --> 01:22:31,814
And after that, when we were ...

833
01:22:33,081 --> 01:22:35,690
... together in a private way ...

834
01:22:36,080 --> 01:22:38,094
... I knew it wasn't Jack.

835
01:22:43,713 --> 01:22:46,005
A woman would know her own husband.

836
01:22:46,301 --> 01:22:49,831
I'm sure most husbands would
like to think so, Mrs. Sommersby.

837
01:22:51,551 --> 01:22:54,601
But when you realized
this man was not your husband ...

838
01:22:55,223 --> 01:22:58,157
... why did you allow people
to believe he was?

839
01:23:03,193 --> 01:23:06,003
People believe
what they want to sometimes.

840
01:23:06,573 --> 01:23:09,623
Everybody wanted
Jack to be alive and home ...

841
01:23:10,034 --> 01:23:14,320
... and when this man showed up,
looking like him, acting like him ...

842
01:23:14,744 --> 01:23:17,160
... it weren't hard
just to let it be him.

843
01:23:19,004 --> 01:23:21,814
But there were signs
anyone could notice.

844
01:23:22,135 --> 01:23:26,383
For instance, Mr. Mead fit him
for boots and saw that his foot ...

845
01:23:26,765 --> 01:23:28,290
... was smaller than Jack's.

846
01:23:28,633 --> 01:23:30,887
Got them templates mixed up,
that's all.

847
01:23:31,225 --> 01:23:34,917
Another thing, one day these drifters
came looking for work.

848
01:23:35,264 --> 01:23:37,154
They'd been in the Army with Jack ...

849
01:23:37,434 --> 01:23:40,283
... when he was wounded,
and they said this man wasn't him.

850
01:23:41,065 --> 01:23:43,318
Why is she saying that about you?

851
01:23:45,276 --> 01:23:46,974
I don't know, son.

852
01:23:47,786 --> 01:23:50,673
Tell her it's you. All right?

853
01:23:54,246 --> 01:23:57,018
All right.
You go back and sit down now.

854
01:23:59,047 --> 01:24:01,617
Well, Jack, whoever he is ...

855
01:24:01,968 --> 01:24:05,133
... pulled a knife on them
so they couldn't expose him.

856
01:24:08,558 --> 01:24:12,049
Mrs. Sommersby, I have here
a promissory note ...

857
01:24:12,397 --> 01:24:16,205
... offering an option to purchase land,
given to a Mr. Joseph ...

858
01:24:16,567 --> 01:24:18,533
... signed by the defendant.

859
01:24:18,817 --> 01:24:20,428
Is that your husband's signature?

860
01:24:20,698 --> 01:24:24,582
No. He couldn't sign like Jack, so
he made up a story about a bad hand.

861
01:24:26,828 --> 01:24:29,878
Your Honor, this witness
will say anything ...

862
01:24:30,157 --> 01:24:33,610
... to save her husband.
I move we strike her testimony.

863
01:24:35,710 --> 01:24:39,201
Can you offer any support
to the claims of this witness?

864
01:24:41,220 --> 01:24:43,301
I can, Your Honor, and do.

865
01:24:44,640 --> 01:24:48,083
The defense calls Mr. Matthew Folsom.

866
01:24:51,849 --> 01:24:53,336
What is your occupation?

867
01:24:53,560 --> 01:24:56,370
I have a 2,000 -acre farm
down in Clark County.

868
01:24:58,361 --> 01:25:00,126
Do you see the defendant?

869
01:25:00,573 --> 01:25:01,704
Yes, sir.

870
01:25:02,201 --> 01:25:03,524
Can you identify him?

871
01:25:04,861 --> 01:25:07,230
Yes. His name's Horace Townsend.

872
01:25:08,741 --> 01:25:11,148
Horace Townsend.

873
01:25:11,873 --> 01:25:13,963
How do you know the defendant?

874
01:25:14,252 --> 01:25:17,100
He was the schoolteacher
in Redthorn for a short while.

875
01:25:17,461 --> 01:25:19,629
He taught my children for a year.

876
01:25:20,922 --> 01:25:21,775
Please continue.

877
01:25:22,762 --> 01:25:27,049
I don't know where he come from, but
he sweet-talked his way into the job.

878
01:25:27,473 --> 01:25:30,926
He knew a lot of fancy stuff
and Greek writing and all.

879
01:25:31,473 --> 01:25:36,048
He talked us into some scheme
to build a new schoolhouse.

880
01:25:36,444 --> 01:25:40,367
We gave him everything we had
and then some. More than $ 1,200.

881
01:25:41,363 --> 01:25:42,811
He run off with every cent.

882
01:25:44,243 --> 01:25:45,931
So, Mr. Folsom ...

883
01:25:46,744 --> 01:25:49,909
... are you quite sure
that this man is Horace Townsend?

884
01:25:50,834 --> 01:25:54,478
I'm sure. There's a whole bunch
of folks in Clark County ...

885
01:25:54,834 --> 01:25:57,279
... be pleased to see "Yellow Horace" in jail.

886
01:25:57,963 --> 01:26:00,773
Thank you, Mr. Folsom.
Your Honor ...

887
01:26:01,096 --> 01:26:02,784
Heard he moved on south ...

888
01:26:03,095 --> 01:26:05,665
... got some girl in the family way
and ran out on her.

889
01:26:05,974 --> 01:26:09,503
Ran out on the Army too.
That's why they call him "Yellow Horace".

890
01:26:09,854 --> 01:26:11,782
When our boys were in a bad fix ...

891
01:26:12,276 --> 01:26:17,004
... he ran out and left them to it.
The Yankees found him behind the bushes.

892
01:26:17,487 --> 01:26:21,812
We lost track of him after that.
But I knew him as soon as I saw him.

893
01:26:22,235 --> 01:26:25,084
- What you're saying is ...
- What I'm saying ...

894
01:26:25,868 --> 01:26:29,838
... is that man is a liar,
a thief and a deserter.

895
01:26:30,208 --> 01:26:32,979
- And his name is Horace Townsend.
- Thank you, Mr. Folsom.

896
01:26:34,957 --> 01:26:36,050
Your Honor ...

897
01:26:36,297 --> 01:26:39,184
... I believe the defense
has proven beyond a doubt ...

898
01:26:39,547 --> 01:26:41,839
... that this is a case
of wrongful arrest ...

899
01:26:42,138 --> 01:26:43,787
Your Honor, may I speak?

900
01:26:44,848 --> 01:26:46,133
You may not.

901
01:26:46,727 --> 01:26:49,335
- I move for a mistrial.
- lf I dismiss my attorney ...

902
01:26:49,649 --> 01:26:50,857
... may I then speak?

903
01:26:51,230 --> 01:26:52,678
You have the right to.

904
01:26:52,978 --> 01:26:54,992
- You are dismissed.
- You don't need to.

905
01:26:55,278 --> 01:26:59,287
On the basis of that man's testimony,
I'm about to rule on a mistrial.

906
01:26:59,698 --> 01:27:02,584
Mr. Webb is trying to prove
I'm not who I am.

907
01:27:03,079 --> 01:27:05,966
I don't see how I could win
anything that way.

908
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:10,083
You could win your life.

909
01:27:11,999 --> 01:27:14,492
Without my name,
I don't think I have a life ...

910
01:27:15,341 --> 01:27:16,348
... Your Honor.

911
01:27:19,970 --> 01:27:21,293
Very well.

912
01:27:21,840 --> 01:27:23,173
Continue, sir.

913
01:27:24,510 --> 01:27:26,121
Thank you, Mr. Webb.

914
01:27:27,181 --> 01:27:28,793
I said, thank you.

915
01:27:52,213 --> 01:27:54,496
- Mr. Folsom.
- That's me.

916
01:27:54,793 --> 01:27:59,166
You testified that you knew me
as soon as you saw me.

917
01:28:01,723 --> 01:28:03,132
Did we ever meet ...

918
01:28:03,643 --> 01:28:07,172
... since the time you said
that I lived in Redthorn?

919
01:28:07,854 --> 01:28:08,938
I don't believe so.

920
01:28:13,483 --> 01:28:14,413
I do believe so.

921
01:28:16,904 --> 01:28:19,916
But the last time we met,
you were sitting on a horse ...

922
01:28:20,244 --> 01:28:21,932
... dressed up like a bed.

923
01:28:25,914 --> 01:28:30,162
Didn't you and your White Knights
burn a cross in front of my house?

924
01:28:31,755 --> 01:28:35,878
And beat a black man half to death
because he tried to farm for himself?

925
01:28:36,215 --> 01:28:37,020
I did not!

926
01:28:38,764 --> 01:28:41,047
Didn't your leader
point a gun at me ...

927
01:28:41,346 --> 01:28:45,518
... and say that you and your Knights are
"the only true law in Tennessee"?

928
01:28:45,897 --> 01:28:49,263
You don't recognize the authority
of this court at all, do you?

929
01:28:50,104 --> 01:28:52,070
Which is why you can lie about me.

930
01:28:52,526 --> 01:28:54,377
You are the liar!

931
01:28:54,697 --> 01:28:57,066
The real reason you are here is ...

932
01:28:57,407 --> 01:28:59,853
... to stop me from selling land
to a colored man ...

933
01:29:00,496 --> 01:29:03,297
... who'd then be a landowner
on a level with yourself.

934
01:29:03,957 --> 01:29:05,481
You may go to hell!

935
01:29:05,827 --> 01:29:08,042
You will watch your tongue
in my court.

936
01:29:08,797 --> 01:29:12,403
And you will watch your tongue
in my presence!

937
01:29:13,048 --> 01:29:15,378
You sit up there
in judgment of nobody!

938
01:29:15,677 --> 01:29:17,845
In two years,
when the Yankees are gone ...

939
01:29:18,138 --> 01:29:21,226
... you will be back in the field
where you belong!

940
01:29:24,187 --> 01:29:26,393
Quite possibly, Mr. Folsom.

941
01:29:26,687 --> 01:29:30,130
But in the meantime, you are
in contempt of my court ...

942
01:29:30,480 --> 01:29:32,848
... and I sentence you to 30 days
in county jail.

943
01:29:33,358 --> 01:29:37,051
Sentence me?
You nappy -headed son of a bitch!

944
01:29:37,569 --> 01:29:39,065
Sixty days!

945
01:29:44,371 --> 01:29:47,344
Show Mr. Folsom the way
to our uncomfortable facilities.

946
01:29:47,671 --> 01:29:49,272
You're a dead man!

947
01:29:50,340 --> 01:29:53,544
The jury will disregard
the testimony of that witness.

948
01:29:54,550 --> 01:29:55,518
Mr. Towns ...

949
01:29:56,721 --> 01:29:58,486
How shall I address you?

950
01:29:58,802 --> 01:30:00,413
Jack Sommersby.

951
01:30:01,971 --> 01:30:04,464
Can you offer evidence to that effect?

952
01:30:08,352 --> 01:30:10,846
How many of y'all are here
from Vine Hill?

953
01:30:15,951 --> 01:30:19,192
How many willing to swear
I'm Jack Sommersby?

954
01:30:19,823 --> 01:30:20,916
- I will!
- I'll swear!

955
01:30:32,004 --> 01:30:35,216
We could bring them all up here
one by one, Your Honor.

956
01:30:35,553 --> 01:30:37,960
Or what we could do,
if you want, is ...

957
01:30:38,263 --> 01:30:42,512
... bring Mrs. Sommersby back up here,
find out how this all got started.

958
01:30:45,394 --> 01:30:48,444
Now, Laurel, you really believe
I'm not your husband?

959
01:30:49,275 --> 01:30:50,368
Yes, you are not.

960
01:30:52,024 --> 01:30:54,594
But you let everybody
believe that I was.

961
01:30:55,745 --> 01:30:56,752
Why is that?

962
01:30:57,245 --> 01:31:00,132
Because I wanted you to be him
as much as they did.

963
01:31:00,575 --> 01:31:01,428
Why?

964
01:31:01,875 --> 01:31:04,043
I was worn out from work and lonesome.

965
01:31:04,415 --> 01:31:06,583
- I didn't want my son ...
- You mean, our son?

966
01:31:06,874 --> 01:31:09,646
I didn't want my son growing up
without a father.

967
01:31:09,967 --> 01:31:14,656
I see. So even when I first come home,
from then, you had doubts about me?

968
01:31:18,264 --> 01:31:19,952
Because I was mean to you?

969
01:31:21,517 --> 01:31:23,330
That's where you went wrong.

970
01:31:24,146 --> 01:31:27,273
Jack Sommersby never said a kind word
to me in his life.

971
01:31:27,606 --> 01:31:30,291
Objection, Your Honor!
Is this a court of law?

972
01:31:30,735 --> 01:31:33,699
May I humbly remind you
that this is a murder trial?

973
01:31:33,987 --> 01:31:37,718
And may I remind you this court
will not try a man for murder ...

974
01:31:38,078 --> 01:31:41,205
... as long as his identity
is in question.

975
01:31:41,918 --> 01:31:43,644
Now please sit down.

976
01:31:46,838 --> 01:31:48,488
- Continue, sir.
- Thank you.

977
01:31:49,218 --> 01:31:52,900
But I must warn you,
you proceed at your own jeopardy.

978
01:31:58,889 --> 01:32:01,623
I think all these people
are flat stumped now.

979
01:32:03,229 --> 01:32:07,075
These people have known you
since you was born. Haven't you?

980
01:32:08,739 --> 01:32:11,059
They may not know everything
that you'd do ...

981
01:32:11,360 --> 01:32:13,652
... but they'd know what you wouldn't.

982
01:32:14,570 --> 01:32:18,022
They know you wouldn't let a man
sign contracts with them ...

983
01:32:18,370 --> 01:32:19,981
... if he wasn't Jack.

984
01:32:22,209 --> 01:32:24,578
It wouldn't be worth the paper
it's printed on.

985
01:32:25,961 --> 01:32:27,092
Meaning ...

986
01:32:27,962 --> 01:32:30,369
... they wouldn't own anything.

987
01:32:35,681 --> 01:32:37,005
You thought of that?

988
01:32:42,642 --> 01:32:44,215
What about our children?

989
01:32:45,521 --> 01:32:48,369
What about them?
If I wasn't Jack Sommersby ...

990
01:32:49,903 --> 01:32:51,515
... what would that make them?

991
01:32:53,033 --> 01:32:55,162
What about our little Rachel?

992
01:32:56,033 --> 01:32:58,565
"Bastard" is not a very pretty word.

993
01:33:00,163 --> 01:33:01,649
Is that what you want?

994
01:33:05,083 --> 01:33:05,898
And you?

995
01:33:09,001 --> 01:33:12,694
You think you can just go home now
with your illegitimate child ...

996
01:33:14,095 --> 01:33:15,783
... and your thief lover?

997
01:33:17,104 --> 01:33:18,984
Just tell all these good folks ...

998
01:33:19,264 --> 01:33:21,441
... you've been lying to them
for a year?

999
01:33:26,696 --> 01:33:27,981
They know you better.

1000
01:33:30,404 --> 01:33:32,370
Maybe they don't know me that well.

1001
01:33:36,415 --> 01:33:38,304
Now nobody knows either one of us.

1002
01:33:38,576 --> 01:33:42,710
You can twist it around all you want,
but we both know you're not Jack.

1003
01:33:43,206 --> 01:33:45,258
Everybody here knows who I am.

1004
01:33:45,586 --> 01:33:48,914
I know who I am. The only people
who don't are you and Orin.

1005
01:34:00,896 --> 01:34:03,706
You make some kind of a deal?
With Orin?

1006
01:34:04,896 --> 01:34:06,786
Don't be ridiculous!

1007
01:34:08,606 --> 01:34:10,141
This man shows up here ...

1008
01:34:10,446 --> 01:34:12,853
... with a skunk in a sheet ...

1009
01:34:13,116 --> 01:34:16,847
... telling everyone I'm not who I am.
What does he expect in return?

1010
01:34:17,458 --> 01:34:18,301
Stop this.

1011
01:34:18,538 --> 01:34:21,387
No. Tell me,
what did you promise him?

1012
01:34:21,748 --> 01:34:25,402
That everything would be the way it was
before you came.

1013
01:34:33,929 --> 01:34:37,056
Everything would be
the way it was before.

1014
01:34:40,271 --> 01:34:42,841
Except you'd be promised to a man ...

1015
01:34:43,519 --> 01:34:45,255
... you don't love.

1016
01:34:48,819 --> 01:34:52,147
And I would be some piece
of scum named Horace Townsend ...

1017
01:34:52,531 --> 01:34:54,219
... serving a few years for fraud.

1018
01:34:55,121 --> 01:34:56,607
At least you wouldn't hang.

1019
01:34:57,789 --> 01:35:00,196
I wouldn't have to.
I'd be dead already.

1020
01:35:03,712 --> 01:35:05,006
You care for me?

1021
01:35:05,382 --> 01:35:06,188
Of course!

1022
01:35:06,591 --> 01:35:07,962
Then why are you doing this?

1023
01:35:09,221 --> 01:35:11,465
Because you are not Jack Sommersby!

1024
01:35:12,510 --> 01:35:14,562
- How do you know?
- A woman knows her husband.

1025
01:35:14,851 --> 01:35:17,018
- You've got no proof.
- I don't need any!

1026
01:35:17,312 --> 01:35:20,199
- Nobody believes you!
- I don't care. I know how I feel.

1027
01:35:20,483 --> 01:35:21,855
That's all that matters?

1028
01:35:22,111 --> 01:35:23,799
You're a hardheaded woman!

1029
01:35:24,153 --> 01:35:28,401
You're a stubborn idiot! You're not
Jack, so why do you pretend you are?

1030
01:35:28,823 --> 01:35:29,993
How do you know?

1031
01:35:30,243 --> 01:35:32,286
- I know because ...
- How do you know?

1032
01:35:33,203 --> 01:35:37,087
I know because I never loved him
the way that I love you.

1033
01:35:44,044 --> 01:35:47,093
So tell me, Laurel, from your heart ...

1034
01:35:50,094 --> 01:35:51,187
... am I your husband?

1035
01:36:02,604 --> 01:36:04,253
Yes, you are.

1036
01:36:05,575 --> 01:36:06,342
Thank you.

1037
01:36:28,886 --> 01:36:30,776
No more questions, Your Honor.

1038
01:36:32,018 --> 01:36:33,390
Mr. Dawson?

1039
01:36:37,147 --> 01:36:39,391
You may step down, Mrs. Sommersby.

1040
01:36:44,987 --> 01:36:47,519
Do you have any more witnesses,
Mr. Sommersby?

1041
01:36:48,237 --> 01:36:49,570
No, sir.

1042
01:36:51,866 --> 01:36:53,957
Kindly approach the bench, sir.

1043
01:36:57,288 --> 01:36:59,542
You've argued most effectively.

1044
01:36:59,840 --> 01:37:04,165
Your identity not being in question
leaves little doubt about your guilt.

1045
01:37:05,638 --> 01:37:07,604
Don't you have anything else to say?

1046
01:37:43,051 --> 01:37:44,663
What's it say?

1047
01:37:47,802 --> 01:37:49,413
How much did we get?

1048
01:37:57,564 --> 01:38:00,537
I said eight, hoped for 10 ...

1049
01:38:02,783 --> 01:38:03,665
... got 12?

1050
01:38:11,084 --> 01:38:13,770
Now, how much we get
for the whole crop?

1051
01:38:15,503 --> 01:38:17,153
Just over $ 10,000.

1052
01:38:18,043 --> 01:38:20,009
God Al mighty!
Come on, woman.

1053
01:38:20,254 --> 01:38:21,980
Come here. Dance around!

1054
01:38:22,215 --> 01:38:23,702
Jump around!

1055
01:38:25,135 --> 01:38:27,225
We did it! We did it!

1056
01:38:29,973 --> 01:38:31,383
You and me.

1057
01:38:35,817 --> 01:38:37,265
How are the kids?

1058
01:38:37,605 --> 01:38:38,900
They're fine.

1059
01:38:39,154 --> 01:38:42,194
Rachel's all fat and sassy.

1060
01:38:42,614 --> 01:38:43,621
Robbie?

1061
01:38:45,656 --> 01:38:48,064
He's having a hard time of it.

1062
01:38:51,785 --> 01:38:53,396
He don't understand.

1063
01:38:54,337 --> 01:38:57,942
I don't understand.
What am I supposed to tell him?

1064
01:39:01,046 --> 01:39:03,894
You tell him his daddy
never killed anybody.

1065
01:39:05,177 --> 01:39:07,191
What about Horace Townsend?

1066
01:39:18,188 --> 01:39:19,885
Horace Townsend.

1067
01:39:40,878 --> 01:39:42,652
I knew Horace Townsend.

1068
01:39:43,680 --> 01:39:44,486
Very well.

1069
01:39:50,062 --> 01:39:53,993
Everything they said about him
in the courtroom there ...

1070
01:39:55,521 --> 01:39:56,815
... it was true.

1071
01:40:00,070 --> 01:40:01,681
I hated the bastard!

1072
01:40:03,610 --> 01:40:05,787
The only piece of luck
he ever had was ...

1073
01:40:06,911 --> 01:40:08,321
... being locked up.

1074
01:40:09,750 --> 01:40:12,119
Some man looked just like him.

1075
01:40:13,752 --> 01:40:15,440
Could have been brothers.

1076
01:40:15,922 --> 01:40:17,533
Probably were.

1077
01:40:26,683 --> 01:40:29,733
After spending four years
in that cell together ...

1078
01:40:31,142 --> 01:40:33,990
... they knew all there was
to know about each other.

1079
01:40:42,703 --> 01:40:44,343
Anyway, he's dead now.

1080
01:40:45,284 --> 01:40:46,214
Who?

1081
01:40:49,294 --> 01:40:50,176
Horace.

1082
01:40:50,794 --> 01:40:52,041
You didn't kill him?

1083
01:40:55,884 --> 01:40:57,649
No, he got stabbed ...

1084
01:40:58,713 --> 01:41:00,603
... that night he killed Conklin.

1085
01:41:02,056 --> 01:41:03,465
Bled to death.

1086
01:41:06,055 --> 01:41:08,107
I buried him on a hill ...

1087
01:41:08,474 --> 01:41:10,086
... under some rocks.

1088
01:41:10,565 --> 01:41:12,607
You mean you buried Jack, don't you?

1089
01:41:16,407 --> 01:41:18,450
I mean I buried Horace.

1090
01:41:21,326 --> 01:41:22,687
For good, Laurel.

1091
01:41:23,825 --> 01:41:26,597
You've got to tell them.
You've got to tell that judge.

1092
01:41:26,918 --> 01:41:29,238
- He'll understand.
- Don't do this.

1093
01:41:29,536 --> 01:41:30,591
No.

1094
01:41:30,918 --> 01:41:35,166
You want to hold me, then hold me today
and every day after that!

1095
01:41:35,505 --> 01:41:37,912
You say that you love me, then show me!

1096
01:41:38,257 --> 01:41:41,584
Be a father and grow old with me.
That's what love is!

1097
01:41:41,927 --> 01:41:44,296
- You think I don't want that?
- Then come home.

1098
01:41:44,597 --> 01:41:47,483
You don't understand.
If I'm Horace, we got no home.

1099
01:41:47,847 --> 01:41:48,777
I don't care.

1100
01:41:49,057 --> 01:41:52,624
I do care!
I will not be Horace Townsend again!

1101
01:41:56,569 --> 01:41:58,420
You'd rather die?

1102
01:42:01,868 --> 01:42:03,431
I would rather be home.

1103
01:42:03,699 --> 01:42:08,187
If you know some way for Jack Sommersby
to walk out of here, I'll do it.

1104
01:42:17,681 --> 01:42:19,925
There's nothing I can say, is there?

1105
01:42:28,230 --> 01:42:29,755
Do you know ...

1106
01:42:30,563 --> 01:42:33,536
... how many nights I stayed up
in our bedroom ...

1107
01:42:33,980 --> 01:42:35,476
... just looking at you?

1108
01:42:38,491 --> 01:42:39,613
Thinking ...

1109
01:42:42,872 --> 01:42:45,279
... what a miracle it is to be here.

1110
01:42:52,002 --> 01:42:55,176
I used to wonder
what I'd ever done to deserve ...

1111
01:42:56,052 --> 01:42:58,296
... being there in a room with you.

1112
01:43:00,342 --> 01:43:01,598
I still do.

1113
01:43:14,772 --> 01:43:16,469
Being your husband ...

1114
01:43:17,695 --> 01:43:21,905
... has been the only thing
I've ever done that I'm proud of.

1115
01:43:32,885 --> 01:43:35,609
We don't have much time now.
You bring it?

1116
01:43:35,925 --> 01:43:38,092
Yes, it's right here.

1117
01:43:39,594 --> 01:43:42,481
Oh, God!
I ironed this thing four times.

1118
01:43:43,807 --> 01:43:45,974
- It's fine.
- It's all wrinkled up.

1119
01:43:50,317 --> 01:43:51,842
It looks terrible.

1120
01:44:03,664 --> 01:44:04,911
My fingers are shaking.

1121
01:44:05,247 --> 01:44:06,378
Let me help.

1122
01:44:12,508 --> 01:44:14,071
You know, I feel that ...

1123
01:44:15,796 --> 01:44:19,968
... if I know you'll be there with me,
I can do this thing right.

1124
01:44:21,730 --> 01:44:25,576
Please don't ask me that. I can't.
I will not watch you die!

1125
01:44:27,569 --> 01:44:29,698
- It's time.
- You wait a minute!

1126
01:44:31,859 --> 01:44:33,106
I'm sorry, sir.

1127
01:44:33,359 --> 01:44:35,095
You keep that for me ...

1128
01:44:35,358 --> 01:44:37,334
... for better or for worse.

1129
01:44:39,579 --> 01:44:41,430
Forgive me the worse.

1130
01:44:43,829 --> 01:44:45,517
It was always you!

1131
01:44:46,331 --> 01:44:48,623
I knew the first moment I saw you ...

1132
01:44:49,130 --> 01:44:51,662
... it was always you, my love.

1133
01:45:17,870 --> 01:45:20,114
- Company!
- Attention!

1134
01:45:43,352 --> 01:45:45,117
God bless you, Jack!

1135
01:46:00,286 --> 01:46:03,461
You, John Robert Sommersby ...

1136
01:46:03,874 --> 01:46:07,279
... having been found guilty
of the murder of Charles Conklin ...

1137
01:46:07,624 --> 01:46:11,114
... are hereby sentenced
to be hanged by the neck until dead.

1138
01:46:11,925 --> 01:46:14,534
Sentence to be carried out immediately.

1139
01:46:14,847 --> 01:46:17,532
May God have mercy on your soul.

1140
01:46:21,936 --> 01:46:24,621
Because he hath set his love upon Me ...

1141
01:46:24,937 --> 01:46:27,872
... therefore will I deliver him.

1142
01:46:29,026 --> 01:46:33,160
I will set him on high
because he hath known My name.

1143
01:46:33,867 --> 01:46:37,358
He shall call upon Me,
and I will answer him.

1144
01:46:37,956 --> 01:46:40,124
I will be with him in trouble.

1145
01:46:40,417 --> 01:46:41,779
I will deliver him ...

1146
01:46:42,036 --> 01:46:45,009
... and honor him and show him My salvation.

1147
01:46:48,759 --> 01:46:50,408
God bless you, Jack.

1148
01:47:06,108 --> 01:47:08,074
No, don't. I'm not ready yet.

1149
01:47:12,950 --> 01:47:14,197
No, don't, not yet!

1150
01:47:14,410 --> 01:47:15,973
Please! Let me through!

1151
01:47:16,911 --> 01:47:18,119
Don't, please!

1152
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:26,091
Jack! I'm here!

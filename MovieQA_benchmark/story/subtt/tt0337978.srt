1
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:14,280
Well....

2
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:16,640
I am sending you the code.

3
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:18,880
Yes I see that, thank you.

4
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,960
- What about my account?
- Delivering.

5
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,640
I have just sent it,
you should have it.

6
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:51,200
Yes, thank you.

7
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:52,920
Are you sure that this is legal?

8
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:55,280
we are just running a test on our
security systems, Sir,

9
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:56,480
it is fine.

10
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,800
you have a sexy voice. Err, is
there anything else we can do for you?

11
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,360
- To you?
- We have a winner.

12
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:14,240
Ready.

13
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:25,920
Yo, guess who just made 50,000 today.

14
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,440
- What did you do to my drive, man?
- Man, shut up I didn't touch it.

15
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,040
Man, don't ever touch my computer.

16
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:47,020
The diagnostics show no damage but we are
certain that it was an intentional breech.

17
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:48,220
Are you saying we were hacked?

18
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:49,940
It wasn't a denial of service level.

19
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:53,020
They definitely cracked our door.

20
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:55,140
OK. Open the "Black Eye" files.

21
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:56,660
I want every hacker in the country,

22
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:58,940
who could have done this,
interviewed, now.

23
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:00,700
Sir, that is close to a thousand names.

24
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:02,540
With the holiday weekend, we are
short staffed as it is.

25
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:03,540
Listen...

26
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:06,620
We are meant to stop this happening
and it just did.

27
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:07,580
Just get it done.

28
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:10,540
Sir, it is the middle of the night and
they are scattered over the whole country.

29
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:12,420
Fine, get local enforcement help.

30
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:16,100
Somebody thinks they can screw with us.
I want to find out who.

31
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,720
Dennis, I said no.

32
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,720
Lucy, you're killing me, alright?

33
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,360
- Get out of the car.
- What?

34
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,200
- Out of the car, now!
- Don't touch me.

35
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,160
- No means no jerk-off.
- What are you doing?

36
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:52,240
- John, stop it!
- Don't call me that.

37
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,960
I hate it when you call me that.

38
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,480
- Do you know this guy?
- Shut up, shut your mouth.

39
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,520
Dad!

40
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,120
Stop it I mean it!

41
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,000
Dad? You said your dad was dead.

42
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:01,960
What?

43
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,520
You told this jerk-off I was dead?

44
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:08,320
- You actually said that?
- I may have exaggerated a little.

45
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,840
And is this guy your boyfriend?

46
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:12,920
- No!
- Yes!

47
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,360
I don't know.

48
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,440
We will see.

49
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,320
What are you doing here?

50
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,760
You don't answer your phone,
you don't return my calls.

51
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,560
That is because I am not
talking to you.

52
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,360
Why aren't you talking to me
this time, Lucy?

53
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,640
why not?

54
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,920
You want a list?

55
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,200
How about stuff like this:
you spy on me!

56
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,480
Do I spy on you?

57
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,240
You come over here and
drag my boyfriend of the car...

58
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:36,080
- You said that he is not your boyfriend.
- He is not!

59
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:39,120
- But you said that I was...
- God! Just...

60
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,320
You are such an asshole.

61
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:44,960
OK

62
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,200
I am sorry for pulling your
not boyfriend out of the car.

63
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,400
OK?

64
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,520
Let's just get in the car.

65
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,920
No!

66
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,560
- Wont both of you just go away?
- Talk to me, Lucy.

67
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,640
I am tired and I am going for bed.
Alone.

68
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,680
You are damn right alone.

69
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,280
Lucy, wait one minute.

70
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:08,120
I want to talk to you.
Wait.

71
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,040
Dad.

72
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,400
When I want to talk to you.

73
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,320
If I want to talk to you.

74
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,080
I'll call you.

75
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:17,560
Lucy!

76
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,240
Wait, Lucy! Lucy!

77
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,800
- Lucy McClane!
- It is not McClane, it is Gennero.

78
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,320
Chicks, right?

79
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,440
I'm gonna go.

80
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,680
I'll go.

81
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:01,460
John!

82
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:03,020
John!

83
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:04,420
it is Sclavino.

84
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,020
This is McClane.

85
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:11,140
- What are you doing at Rutgers?
- How does you know where I am?

86
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:13,660
We had all the cars tracked
4 years ago, you remember.

87
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:15,860
I am looking exactly
at where you are.

88
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:17,900
So that's not something that I
would turn on.

89
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:19,660
Yes, we did that, John.

90
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:21,140
We turned them on.

91
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:22,100
Listen...

92
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:23,780
The feds have called in a favour.

93
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:25,140
they are doing a sweep.

94
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:27,860
They want us to pick up a
a computer hacker in Camden.

95
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:29,740
The last name is Farrell.

96
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:31,580
THE first name is Mathew.

97
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:32,700
Camden?

98
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:33,820
What are you telling me for?

99
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:36,940
It's 3 in the morning.
I’m on my way home.

100
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:40,060
Send a jug-head from the Academy.
They will be happy to go pick this kid up.

101
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:41,980
I can't just send
any one in uniform.

102
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:44,380
The feds demanded
a senior detective.

103
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,420
The kid is a high value subject.

104
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,260
I don't know.
Just pick him up.

105
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:50,540
Escort him to the
Hoover building in Washington.

106
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:54,300
They had some kind of
computer breech there this morning.

107
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:55,380
Right.

108
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:58,140
Give me the information.

109
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:01,020
Give me that name again
What is it?

110
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:02,820
You owe me one, Jack.

111
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:16,100
God damn it.

112
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:31,980
Plan B,
We do it ourselves

113
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:41,060
- Who is it?
- NYPD.

114
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:42,900
Open the door, please.

115
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:51,380
- Hi.
- NYPD?

116
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:53,180
Yeah.
I get it.

117
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:57,140
Don't worry, everyone gets lost
round here, happy to help

118
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:58,620
Son, I am not lost.

119
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:00,580
Are you Matt Farrell?
Mathew Farrell?

120
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:01,460
No...

121
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,500
Actually, he doesn't live here.

122
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:05,420
Of course not.
Who are you?

123
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:07,180
My name is Daisy Duke.

124
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:09,140
I got a lot of shit for
it when I was a kid.

125
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:11,180
Please, don't add to it.

126
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:14,620
Can I see some identification, please?

127
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:15,900
Yeah, sure.

128
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:21,780
Detective!
Yeah that looks real.

129
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:23,820
Where did you get that?
Toys R Us?

130
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:25,780
It looks great.

131
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:27,060
That...

132
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:28,980
That actually looks pretty good.

133
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:30,620
Farrell!

134
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:34,260
Soldier just pdld a new copy of the killzone.
Do you want to come to take a look?

135
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:35,820
No, thanks though man!

136
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:38,500
And good luck at the bad timing awards.

137
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:40,220
Open the door.

138
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:42,620
Shit!

139
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:53,220
- What's this about?
- I don't know.

140
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:54,860
Some kind of computer thing.

141
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:56,780
The DC Feds
wanna talk to you.

142
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:57,940
So, let's go.

143
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:01,060
- Feds, huh?
- Yeah, the Feds.

144
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:10,500
I've been watched for four years.

145
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:14,260
Once you are on that
god damn list. Pain in the ass.

146
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:15,980
Do you play with dolls?

147
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:18,900
Err, could you please
not touch that.

148
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:20,740
- Is it like a G.I.Joe?
- No, it is not!

149
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:22,620
It is a limited edition of...

150
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:25,380
- Is that meant to come off?
- No, it is not.

151
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:28,940
But it is much more valuable broken.
So thanks for that.

152
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:30,820
Crazy glue, I'm sure it's
very important.

153
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:33,340
I have other cool shit in
here if you want to break that.

154
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:34,860
Let's go, OK? Come on!

155
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:37,300
I need to power down
my gear, ok?

156
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:40,500
More dolls.

157
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:43,220
You don't spend a whole load of
time with the girls, huh?

158
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:47,380
Hey! Are you really trying to escape?

159
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,640
Please! Don't shoot.

160
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,920
- Don't shoot.
- Get down!

161
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,560
Keep your head down.

162
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,600
Let's go, come on.
Stay down.

163
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Come on.

164
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:31,120
- Is everything OK?
- No.

165
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,360
Stay down.

166
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,680
- You stay with me.
- OK.

167
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,440
- Follow me.
- OK.

168
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:40,760
Right.

169
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,080
That's gonna wake the neighbours.

170
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:01,560
Get down, get inside.
Get down!

171
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,720
They are back in the room!

172
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,360
They are back in the room!

173
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,880
Are you nuts?

174
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,240
- Get out of there right now!
- I am trying...

175
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,240
Now!

176
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:20,120
Go to the right.

177
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,320
Let's go!

178
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,960
Get back in there!

179
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,640
Get ready to run.

180
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:46,000
Ready?

181
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,320
What the hell was that?

182
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:20,840
What?

183
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,360
Did you do that?

184
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,000
No.

185
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,000
Shit.

186
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,200
I didn't do that.

187
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,880
- Let's go.
- Shit.

188
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,800
Stay close to me.

189
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,120
OK.

190
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:33,920
Let's go.

191
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,840
Come on, let's go damn it!

192
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:37,560
Let's go.

193
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:38,680
Let's go!

194
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,560
Watch it.
Just tone it down.

195
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:42,920
OK.

196
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:47,960
- Let's go!

197
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,360
Stay close.

198
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,640
Stay with me.

199
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,720
- Stay with me.
- Right!

200
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,360
Let's go.
Stay close.

201
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,440
Get in the car.

202
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:14,760
- Go, go.
- Yes.

203
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:23,120
- Kid, can you reload a gun?
- What? Me?

204
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:25,920
- Can you reload a gun?
- Oh, yeah...

205
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:30,640
Look in the glove box and get a
magazine out right now!

206
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:06,880
Get your head down.

207
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,840
Is the circus in town?

208
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,880
- Did you see that?
- I saw it. I did it.

209
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:29,000
Camden Base 10077,
come back.

210
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,200
Camden Base 10077.

211
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,720
Camden Base go ahead.

212
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:35,600
I need to speak with your chief,
this is a police emergency.

213
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:36,760
ASAP.

214
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:37,840
Standby.

215
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,680
This is chief detective Wiesman.

216
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:42,400
Detective this is Detective John McClane
of the NYPD.

217
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:43,880
Police Emergency.

218
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:46,880
I want to report a police
shooting in your jurisdiction.

219
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:02,440
Tell him yourself.

220
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,120
Yes.

221
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,440
What's the status?

222
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:09,800
We lost him.

223
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:12,520
Three of our men are dead.

224
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,320
Hold the line.

225
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,640
Thomas.

226
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:41,000
We have a problem in New Jersey.
Farrell is still alive.

227
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,880
- So he got away?
- Yes.

228
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:48,240
- I did send 5 of you, right?
- Yes, but he was not alone.

229
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,960
I am sending the chopper, get airborne.
We will track him down.

230
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:53,200
Think you can handle that?

231
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:58,800
Oh my God!

232
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:02,320
- Just breathe.
- I am breathing, but...

233
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,280
- I can't stop shaking.
- It is the adrenaline.

234
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,880
You are just scared.
It will pass.

235
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,680
Of course I'm scared.

236
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,760
Weren’t you scared, back there?

237
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:11,880
Yes.

238
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,960
I was scared.

239
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:16,120
Really?
This is you being scared?

240
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:18,320
I dunno, you seem really calm.

241
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:21,040
Have you done stuff like that before?

242
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,680
Stuff like what?

243
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:24,760
Like killing people.

244
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,080
Yes.

245
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,760
Not for a long time.

246
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:32,320
Who were those guys?

247
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:36,760
Why did they try to kill you?
Why did they blow up my apartment?

248
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,920
They were there to kill you.

249
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,800
Why would they want to kill me?

250
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,240
You tell me, kid.

251
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:44,960
You're the criminal.

252
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:03,560
We got 7 dead hackers so far,
none high on our list

253
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:05,320
Collect the hard drives
and start sweeping them..

254
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:06,280
Yes, Sir.

255
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,240
Trey...

256
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,560
Matthew Farrell,
Find him for me.

257
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:15,680
On it.

258
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:20,080
What's with all the guns?

259
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,840
Operational prudence.

260
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:26,800
Think of them as
hardware to your software.

261
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,400
good morning D.C.

262
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:42,680
Well it' shaping up to be
another beautiful 4th of July weekend.

263
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:45,080
If you've got any big plans,
you better get started early.

264
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,520
Because it looks like the
traffic is hotting up.

265
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:51,640
So another golden oldie
for all the commuters out there.

266
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:53,580
What?

267
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:54,620
What?

268
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:55,500
What?

269
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:57,740
What are you doing?
What is that?

270
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:59,020
It is Credence.

271
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:00,700
- Credence?
- Credence.

272
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:02,740
Credence Clearwater Revival.

273
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:04,820
- Classic rock.
- I know who it is.

274
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:07,260
It is  old rock,
that does not make it classic.

275
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:09,260
What sucked back then
still sucks now.

276
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:10,660
You don't like Credence?

277
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:13,580
It is like having a pine cone
shoved up my ass.

278
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:14,940
OK, really...

279
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:16,540
Wow how mature!

280
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:18,620
Come on man.

281
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:24,580
We are at a heading of 060.
Making another pass.

282
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:29,060
Listen up everyone.

283
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:30,740
Are we ready?

284
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:33,980
The transportation hubs
are prepped and set.

285
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:35,420
Begin stage 1.

286
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:10,940
When was the last time you tuned
in your radio to pop music?

287
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:12,460
Give me any decade.

288
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:14,500
Was it the seventies?

289
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:16,740
Did Michael Jackson still play?

290
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:19,420
Pearl Jam.
I'm going back about 10 years.

291
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:20,660
Ten years.

292
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:22,180
Twenty years. The Cure? Nothing?

293
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:24,140
It's called News Radio.

294
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:27,171
I'm trying to see if any of your
friends from Camden made the headlines.

295
00:21:27,171 --> 00:21:28,420
Hold on.

296
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:32,620
- You listen to the news?
- Yeah, you have a problem with the news now?

297
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:35,620
Yes, I have a big God damned
problem with the news.

298
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:36,860
Are you ready for this?

299
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:39,300
The news is completely manipulated.

300
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:42,300
Everything that you hear
every single day...

301
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:45,820
is designed by corporate media
to do one thing only.

302
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:46,574
Jesus!

303
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,120
To keep you living in fear.

304
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:49,320
- Oh fear?
- Total fear.

305
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:51,280
Fear so you will go out and
spend money on things.

306
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,600
Things you probably don't even need.
Things you should already be sick of.

307
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,880
So that their advertisers keep
buying adds on their stations.

308
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,440
And I tell one more thing.
Are you ready for this?

309
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:00,440
I can do this all day man.
I've got days of data at home.

310
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:02,160
I'll drop a bomb on you bigger......

311
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,920
- HEY!
- SHUT UP!

312
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,120
That's good, that's good,
be dismissive

313
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,120
You...

314
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:59,000
- Are you OK?
- No, I am not OK.

315
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,880
Stay in the car.
You will be OK.

316
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:05,760
Hey man! Hey.

317
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,400
How are you doing,
you alright?

318
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,120
Just call 911, alright?

319
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:15,440
Jesus Christ.

320
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,440
All of the lights are green.

321
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:39,800
All of the lights are green.

322
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:40,960
Let's go, right now.

323
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,240
- We gotta go?
- Let's go.

324
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:44,280
Get your bag hack boy.
Let's go.

325
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:47,200
- Jesus.
- Let's go.

326
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,840
I've never been in a crash.
Are you alright?

327
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,800
Well it is very exciting.
This way, here we go.

328
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:53,000
- Have you ever been in a car accident?
- Yes, I have been in a car accident.

329
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,080
What are we doing?

330
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:58,200
A little thing they invented back
in the 60s, it's called jogging.

331
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:11,760
Sir, Chicago is reporting a system crash
in their train network

332
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:18,200
Amtrak is flashing a level 1
crash of their system

333
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:22,120
F.A.A. just issued a critical alert.
Their ATC Net just went down.

334
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,720
We are under attack.

335
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:26,600
OK.

336
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:30,680
Let's get them outside
for a little bit of fresh air.

337
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:40,920
That is the Anthrax Alarm.

338
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:44,720
Alright, everyone out,
Now!

339
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:45,760
Now!

340
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:49,920
Taylor, move, go.

341
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,120
Move!

342
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:10,600
All personnel must evacuate
and proceed to the shelters immediately.

343
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:12,720
This is not a drill.

344
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:17,560
All personnel must evacuate
and proceed to the shelters immediately.

345
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:46,840
Take the team and go for
the fourth floor. Got it?

346
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,200
Masks on.

347
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,400
Make it happen, OK?

348
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:54,200
Research the data
from these crashes,

349
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:57,400
see if you can ID the
point of origin.

350
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,320
Begin Stage 2.

351
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,360
Hey what is going on?

352
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,000
What is happening?

353
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,720
They are already starting
to panic.

354
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,720
Of course they are.

355
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:25,560
They think that someone
is taking their money.

356
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:28,400
All of those nickel
and dimes they saved.

357
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:31,600
Useful idiots,
as Lyman would say.

358
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:34,920
Prep the video package.

359
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:49,400
DC transportation system is crashing

360
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:51,920
And they just hit the financial
sector. Everything.

361
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:56,640
Call the Secretary of Trans, the
Treasury And the Director of F.C.C.

362
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:57,840
Let's go people!

363
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:00,320
Somebody, somewhere,
has left a digital fingerprint.

364
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:01,440
Find it!

365
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,480
Is Deputy Director Bowman
in here?

366
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:06,000
- Not now it will have to wait.
- Not today waxworks.

367
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,520
This is Matthew Farrell.

368
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:09,400
I brought him here on direct
orders from Bowman.

369
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:11,920
So if you don't know what's going on,
find me somebody who does.

370
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:13,160
I am Bowman.

371
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:22,200
The video package is
ready for upload.

372
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:25,320
Thanks.

373
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,080
Listen, John.

374
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:28,440
I thank for bringing Farrell,
but everything’s changed this morning

375
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:30,320
We are neck deep in
damage control right now.

376
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:31,640
'Scuse me, I'm sorry, Sir.

377
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:34,280
Do you have something to eat?
Any snacks around here?

378
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:36,520
I would love... I am
really low on blood sugar.

379
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:37,600
Sir?

380
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,160
No?

381
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:47,120
As if the crash of the traffic
system wasn't bad enough.

382
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:50,080
the Stock exchange was
in a selling frenzy this afternoon.

383
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:55,320
the Commission believes this panic
may have been caused by computer malfunction.

384
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,760
it is Believed to be related...

385
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:00,960
It's not as bad as it looks.

386
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:03,960
We run drills to prepare
for things like this.

387
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:06,400
- Are these your suspects?
- They were.

388
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:09,440
All seven were killed
in the last 24 hours.

389
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:12,520
Do you recognize any of them?

390
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:15,440
No.

391
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:16,920
Not one??

392
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:18,520
Sir.

393
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:20,720
You need to see something here.

394
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:33,040
My fellow Americans...

395
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:34,560
it is time...
to strike...

396
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:36,280
fear...
into...

397
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:37,400
the citizenry.

398
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:39,480
ask not...

399
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:40,880
It's not an authorised broadcast.

400
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,520
what your country can do...

401
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:43,600
to avert this...
crisis.

402
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,760
the answer is...
nothing what so ever.

403
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:47,600
our military...
strength...

404
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,200
is in...
this case...

405
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,720
useless.

406
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:53,640
Read my lips.

407
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:55,920
The...
great...

408
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:57,160
confident...
ruler...

409
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:58,280
of the American...

410
00:28:58,280 --> 00:28:59,560
progress...
and...

411
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:00,880
growth...
has come to...

412
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,000
an end.

413
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,520
All...
the vital...

414
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:04,680
technology...
that...

415
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:05,840
that...
this nation...

416
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:06,800
possesses.

417
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:08,080
All
communication...

418
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:09,600
Transportation,
Internet...

419
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:10,600
Connectivity.

420
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:11,760
Electrical power.

421
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,760
critical.....

422
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:15,480
utilities...
Their...

423
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:16,600
fate...
now rests...

424
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:17,520
in...
our...

425
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:18,440
hands.

426
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:19,640
We will not tire.

427
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:21,360
We will not falter.

428
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,320
And we won't fail.

429
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,600
I don't know how they
are getting in.

430
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Thank you.

431
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:28,160
And a...
Happy...

432
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:30,520
Independence Day...
for everyone!

433
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:34,760
That was creepy.

434
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:37,600
I tried to find more Nixon.

435
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:39,040
Do you think they bought it?

436
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:40,800
Absolutely.

437
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:44,880
OK.

438
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:47,080
I want telecommunications, transports and...

439
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:49,320
Jesus Christ! It's a Fire Sale.

440
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:50,240
What?

441
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,960
It's a Fire Sale.

442
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:55,120
Hey, we don't know that yet.

443
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:56,640
It is a myth anyway.
It cannot be done.

444
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:57,920
Oh it's a myth?
Really?

445
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:00,800
Please tell me she's only here for show
and she's not actually in charge of anything.

446
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:03,440
- What is a Fire Sale?
- It is a three step....

447
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:07,000
It is a three step systematic attack
on the entire national infrastructure.

448
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:09,280
ok Step 1 : Take out all
the transportation

449
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:11,360
Step 2 : The financial base and telecoms

450
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:15,000
Step 3 : Get rid of all the utilities.
Gas, Water, Electricity, Nuclear....

451
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:16,760
Basically everything that is
controlled by a computer.

452
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:19,000
Which nowadays is almost everything.

453
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:22,240
So that's why they call it a Fire Sale
because everything must go.

454
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,240
Hey, listen,
what's your name?

455
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:26,640
Farrell?
Keep your voice down OK?

456
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:28,960
Nobody here is talking about a Fire Sale.

457
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,760
Not unless you are telling me
you helped plan one.

458
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,640
No man, I'm just saying...

459
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:38,400
We appreciate the concern, we
know what we are doing, thank you.

460
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:39,640
What?

461
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:42,720
- What?
- Nothing, I said I understand.

462
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:46,200
Hey, they didn't send the
girl scouts to get this kid.

463
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:49,000
They sent professional guys,
full tactical gear,

464
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,480
they blew the whole joint up.

465
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:52,480
Now look, I don't know this kid...

466
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:54,680
and, frankly, I don't give a shit.
No offence.

467
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:56,920
But somebody wants this kid dead.

468
00:30:57,040 --> 00:31:01,320
And obviously, it's got something
to do with what's going on here.

469
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,760
Humler is taking over
the interrogations,

470
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:05,200
of the hackers that we are bringing in.

471
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,520
I will get you an escort over there.

472
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:10,680
Right? Molina, get this kid
to the front of the line.

473
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:13,400
- I want to know what he knows.
- Right.

474
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:17,040
If he knew about half of what I know,
his fuzzy little head would explode.

475
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:19,160
Special agent Johnson.
I will take you there.

476
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:22,000
- Agent Johnson?
- That's right.

477
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:23,720
Right this way.

478
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:28,720
- So is any of what you were saying possible?
- Possible?

479
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:32,000
OK look, I will tell you again.
If you take away any one thing, no problem,

480
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:35,040
but if you take it down all at once,
the system crashes, and...

481
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:37,080
look around, man!

482
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:41,720
Come on, the government has got to have
dozens of departments dedicated to that shit.

483
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:45,800
It took FEMA 5 days to get
water to the superdome.

484
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:10,560
How long until we get to
the Dept. of Homeland Security?

485
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:14,480
Lauflin, get on the police band and get
them to clear a route to the D.H.S.

486
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:19,400
DC Metro, this is the
F.B.I., requesting you to...

487
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:24,360
Farrell just resurfaced on the grid.

488
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:26,720
The feds are taking him to Homeland.

489
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:28,600
Good, close that loop now.

490
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:29,720
Isolate the frequency.

491
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:33,680
Locate the vehicles and get
me John McClane's file.

492
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:38,520
Brad, we just found Farrell.
Stand by for location.

493
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,400
I don't mean to harp guys but

494
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:45,840
but have just passed another
snack bar and I am starving.

495
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:47,760
- Shut up.
- I need to eat.

496
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,400
- Shut up.

497
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:52,640
Shut up. You have 14 minutes
to tell me why you lied to me back there.

498
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:55,120
Did I lie to you?
What are you talking about?

499
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:57,960
The pictures on the wall.
You knew those guys, right?

500
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:00,520
- I, wha..., I ...
- Kid, don't lie to me.

501
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:04,080
I am a cop, I can tell you are
lying. Who are they?

502
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:08,520
OK, OK OK...

503
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:13,100
They were my competition.

504
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:18,380
Make the next right onto Concord.

505
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:19,620
They said they were a software firm
that had developed some kind of

506
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:21,060
a new algorithm

507
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:24,020
and they just wanted to see
if it could be cracked.

508
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:26,860
That's what I do,
I do math based security.

509
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:32,560
Here's the thing,

510
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:36,840
the thing that I've been thinking is
that if you can do something this massive

511
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,560
you need tons of start-up guys
to write the software

512
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:40,200
but only a few black hats

513
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:42,240
to actually implement that stuff

514
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:45,240
so then the start-up guys
who haven't really done anything

515
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:47,400
like me...
-End up as pictures on a wall

516
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:52,800
I swear to God McClane
I had no idea I was gonna be

517
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,800
an accessory to Armageddon

518
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:58,320
Take the next left at Lexington.

519
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,880
and that's a sexy voice.

520
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:02,840
What is she taking us this way for?

521
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:04,360
- Oh, my God!

522
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:06,760
Unit this is dispatch
clear a route for two F.B.I. vehicles...

523
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:08,520
F.B.I. we have cleared a path.

524
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,640
- That's her!
- Her who?

525
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:13,120
What are you talking about?

526
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:14,840
It is them.

527
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:17,680
- Are you saying it's "them" them?
- I swear to you, I know her.

528
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:20,640
I would know her voice anywhere.

529
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:24,880
- Don't say anything.
- Keep you mouth shut for a second.

530
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:27,960
Hey Metro,
how's your day going over there?

531
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:31,640
Gotta be crazy over there
with all these 5-87s, huh?

532
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:34,440
Yes, Sir, we had to
dispatch all units.

533
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:37,440
Yeah you had to dispatch all units,

534
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:40,160
for all the naked people walking around?

535
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:44,160
Cut the bullshit honey
and just put your boss on.

536
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:49,400
Lauflin, we are getting off this route
make a left here on 14th street..

537
00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:01,200
- Officer McClane.
- That is Detective McClane, asshole.

538
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:04,080
Don't worry though, we will have
plenty of time to get to know each other...

539
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:06,080
when I come visit you in prison.

540
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:09,880
But, John, I already know
so much about you.

541
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,800
Your address in Brooklyn...

542
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:16,360
the payments on your mortgage,
how long you have been in the NYPD

543
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:20,200
and how is Holly?
That's sad, you are divorced.

544
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:22,960
Was that tough on little
Jack and Lucy?

545
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:29,400
After thirty years, I would have thought
you had a better pension plan.

546
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:31,560
Oh and it gets worse...

547
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:36,640
Your 401k no longer exists

548
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:39,600
Tell you what, let me
make it up to you.

549
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:41,680
-Box them in at that intersection.

550
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:43,800
Shoot Mr Farrell in the head,
and drive away

551
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:47,400
by the time you get to the end
of the next block,

552
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,520
all your debts will
be wiped clean...

553
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:52,840
and your children
will be set for life.

554
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:56,320
That really is tempting,
especially that last part.

555
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:58,440
But I think I'll pass, Jerk off.

556
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:04,240
John, you are a Timex
watch in a digital age.

557
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:05,600
You are gonna lose.

558
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:09,840
Yes, well the other thing that can
happen, it is that I can come and find you...

559
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:12,080
kick your ass and throw you
out of your own party.

560
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:15,800
- What do you think about that dickhead?
- Hold your position.

561
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:19,160
He is not responding.

562
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:24,720
Down, get down!

563
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:36,920
Officers down at the corner
of Main with Constitution.

564
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:39,000
I repeat, officers down.

565
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:58,120
Come on, come on,
get out let's go!

566
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:01,840
God Damn It!

567
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:03,440
Stay down!

568
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:11,120
Get down, just hold on!

569
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:23,040
We have a squad car under fire
we need backup.

570
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:24,400
I Repeat, we need backup!

571
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:27,240
This is base, we are
sending backup.

572
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:32,400
Hang on, hang on.

573
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:49,480
Hang on.

574
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:06,080
Hold on.

575
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,520
- We lost ....
- Stay with them.

576
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:41,440
OK take the tunnel, left left left!

577
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:59,120
Give me the schematics
of that tunnel.

578
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:00,640
The tunnel!

579
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:11,720
Open the gates on the North side entrance.

580
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:21,360
Redirect traffic,
occupy all lanes.

581
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:39,320
- Open the other side.
- What?

582
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:40,800
Move!

583
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:47,320
Hang on to something!

584
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,280
Hey, don't get out of the car!
Hey!

585
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:32,840
Stop!

586
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:45,760
Run!

587
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:53,320
Oh God!

588
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:01,640
Don't ever hesitate
like that again.

589
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:03,520
Are you alright?

590
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:11,800
- Stay here, don't move.
- What?

591
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:13,600
You've been here before John.

592
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:16,320
Get over to the wall, Sir.

593
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:18,360
The feds called in a favour.

594
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:24,160
All you gotta do is pick
up a kid in Jersey...

595
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:25,960
drive him down to DC.

596
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:29,520
How hard can that be, huh?
It can't be that hard can it?

597
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:33,080
No, gotta be a senior detective

598
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:39,160
think that a traffic jam

599
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:42,440
or throwing a car at me
Will stop me, huh?

600
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:47,280
- Red, get in there and get it done.
- It won't be necessary, he is leaving.

601
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:59,480
This is not a good idea!

602
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:39,480
- Don't touch me!
- OK OK alright...

603
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:41,560
Are you OK? Oh my God!

604
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:46,480
- Pretty lucky shot, huh?
- Oh yeah lucky!

605
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:50,040
Jesus, you just killed a
helicopter with a car.

606
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:51,760
I was out of bullets.

607
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:56,000
How you doin'?

608
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,320
I skinned my knee and my
asthma is acting up....

609
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:02,080
Whatever, yeah I'm fine.

610
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:15,560
Red, check in.

611
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:19,520
The helicopter is destroyed.

612
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:21,480
What about Farrell and McClane?

613
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:24,720
- They are both dead.
- Come back in.

614
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:27,160
OK we are moving on,
begin Stage 3.

615
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:29,120
I have just spoken to Emmerson.

616
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:30,640
The teams are arriving
at Woodlawn now.

617
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:32,360
Very good.

618
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:34,760
Mai, get ready for the downloads.

619
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:42,840
Identification, Sir.

620
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:45,920
Park behind the transpo
and we will guide you in.

621
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:48,200
Man the gate, you come with me.

622
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:57,360
The anthrax alarms only went off
across five floors.

623
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:00,280
Below that you will
need clearance.

624
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:02,720
I don't know why you would
need to go down there

625
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:05,600
there is nothing down there
but servers.

626
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,800
All clear. Rodriguez!

627
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:14,080
Incoming.

628
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:30,560
- The gate is secured.
- Copy.

629
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:41,120
OK, we are in.

630
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:20,031
Hey, this is absurd
there is tough and there is stupid.

631
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:22,715
You need a hospital,
look at you.

632
00:45:23,740 --> 00:45:25,940
I am not a doctor, but
you look like you are hurt.

633
00:45:26,060 --> 00:45:27,580
- Yes, sexy, right?
- No.

634
00:45:27,580 --> 00:45:28,740
Come on.

635
00:45:28,980 --> 00:45:32,380
We don't need a doctor,
we need the cops.

636
00:45:58,340 --> 00:45:59,740
He's in.

637
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:04,740
Get out of the way,
look out, please.

638
00:46:07,940 --> 00:46:12,700
NYPD, alright, I got this kid.
Come on let's go.

639
00:46:18,220 --> 00:46:19,820
NYPD

640
00:46:22,340 --> 00:46:23,980
Sergeant?

641
00:46:23,980 --> 00:46:25,020
Sergeant!

642
00:46:25,220 --> 00:46:27,180
I need to speak with you.

643
00:46:27,180 --> 00:46:27,860
The doctor is in the back.

644
00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:31,700
I am NYPD,
I need to talk to you.

645
00:46:31,940 --> 00:46:33,340
Just give me a minute.

646
00:46:39,620 --> 00:46:42,020
Oh my God!

647
00:46:46,980 --> 00:46:48,540
Let's get of here.

648
00:46:52,300 --> 00:46:55,100
Perfect! Now the second sequence.

649
00:47:00,780 --> 00:47:02,380
The server is ready.

650
00:47:02,660 --> 00:47:04,380
We are go.

651
00:47:04,620 --> 00:47:06,980
Launch the downloads.

652
00:47:16,140 --> 00:47:18,020
Nothing is happening.

653
00:47:18,020 --> 00:47:19,420
Be patient.

654
00:47:20,900 --> 00:47:24,620
- I don't know, it's not responding.
- Wait for it.

655
00:47:28,580 --> 00:47:29,980
See.

656
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:32,020
There you go.

657
00:47:32,460 --> 00:47:34,460
Let me know when the
download reaches 20%.

658
00:47:34,540 --> 00:47:35,620
OK.

659
00:47:45,220 --> 00:47:47,020
- Excuse me!
- Thank you!

660
00:47:47,260 --> 00:47:48,380
Holy Shit!

661
00:47:49,740 --> 00:47:51,820
Kid? Kid? Hey!

662
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:54,420
- You got a phone in that bag?
- Yes.

663
00:47:54,540 --> 00:47:55,900
Come on let's go.

664
00:47:59,340 --> 00:48:02,660
and here you go, agent...
Tavarek. I guess that's you.

665
00:48:24,780 --> 00:48:26,220
The download is at 20%.

666
00:48:26,220 --> 00:48:30,740
Time to move. Let's keep them
chasing their tails.

667
00:48:44,780 --> 00:48:46,380
Due to the recent activity...

668
00:48:46,380 --> 00:48:49,260
law enforcement agencies are
being extremely cautious.

669
00:48:49,340 --> 00:48:53,860
They are telling people to abandon
vehicles, until they are searched.

670
00:48:54,020 --> 00:48:55,100
And as you can see...

671
00:48:55,100 --> 00:48:57,780
K-9 units are
checking each vehicle.

672
00:48:57,900 --> 00:49:00,700
Now whether this is connected
to the anthrax reports earlier...

673
00:49:00,820 --> 00:49:03,740
or if it is a new  terrorist threat
we don't know that this stage.

674
00:49:03,860 --> 00:49:05,380
FAA just grounded all flights.

675
00:49:05,380 --> 00:49:06,820
- Good.
- Sir...

676
00:49:06,820 --> 00:49:08,820
We have complete access
over system networks.

677
00:49:08,940 --> 00:49:12,220
Phones, power grids,
water, nuclear....

678
00:49:12,300 --> 00:49:14,220
- Hey, excuse me...
- Dan Parry, The NSA

679
00:49:14,260 --> 00:49:17,020
Chuck Summer DHS Liaison.
The White House made the call.

680
00:49:17,140 --> 00:49:19,020
Anything you need,
We are here to help.

681
00:49:19,020 --> 00:49:20,940
Help? Wow. that's, that's great.

682
00:49:21,020 --> 00:49:23,740
We are gonna need some work space
for our people.

683
00:49:23,860 --> 00:49:25,740
What can you do for us?

684
00:49:25,740 --> 00:49:27,740
Well as you can see, we are
using the space...

685
00:49:27,860 --> 00:49:29,940
you guys can stand in the corner,

686
00:49:30,060 --> 00:49:30,980
and liaise.

687
00:49:31,020 --> 00:49:32,940
and if I need something...

688
00:49:32,940 --> 00:49:34,420
I'll just wake you.

689
00:49:56,100 --> 00:49:58,420
- Wait, no no. Don't call.
- What?

690
00:49:58,540 --> 00:50:00,420
- What are you talking about?
- They probably cracked that hours ago

691
00:50:00,420 --> 00:50:02,060
if you use it they might
be able to trace us here.

692
00:50:02,060 --> 00:50:03,180
- Just put in your pocket.
- Sure?

693
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:04,980
Yes.

694
00:50:05,220 --> 00:50:07,140
Or smash it, you didn't have to smash it...

695
00:50:07,980 --> 00:50:10,380
Excuse, me.
police Emergency.

696
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:12,420
He'll call you right back.

697
00:50:13,460 --> 00:50:14,660
Here, wait in here.

698
00:50:15,980 --> 00:50:17,700
- Do you have a signal?
- Yes.

699
00:50:18,940 --> 00:50:20,100
Yes.

700
00:50:20,140 --> 00:50:22,460
This is John McClane
for agent Bowman.

701
00:50:22,540 --> 00:50:24,860
Sir, John McClane is on the line.

702
00:50:25,900 --> 00:50:27,060
McClane, go.

703
00:50:27,060 --> 00:50:28,300
We never made it to DHS

704
00:50:28,340 --> 00:50:32,460
They came for the kid again.
All your men are down.

705
00:50:33,340 --> 00:50:36,380
- And what about Farrell?
- Yeah he's here with me.

706
00:50:36,460 --> 00:50:38,340
- Sir?
- Hang on, John.

707
00:50:38,380 --> 00:50:40,140
Yeah I'll hold on.

708
00:50:45,060 --> 00:50:47,020
Another day in paradise.

709
00:50:47,020 --> 00:50:48,420
They just swamped everything,

710
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:52,260
the whole telecom system.
Phones, cellular, satellite...

711
00:51:03,380 --> 00:51:05,660
They are blanketing every station.

712
00:51:31,180 --> 00:51:33,940
- Can you put the news back on?
- This is the news.

713
00:51:34,060 --> 00:51:36,980
It on every channel,
It's been like this for a few minutes now.

714
00:51:53,820 --> 00:51:55,660
Oh my God!

715
00:51:57,020 --> 00:51:58,020
Shit!

716
00:52:02,980 --> 00:52:03,940
McClane!

717
00:52:05,740 --> 00:52:08,140
Look out!

718
00:52:09,580 --> 00:52:10,380
Look out!

719
00:52:12,460 --> 00:52:14,380
Bowman? Do you see that?

720
00:52:14,500 --> 00:52:16,300
- McClane?
- Bowman?

721
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:17,700
It's a fake.

722
00:52:21,100 --> 00:52:23,500
I see it.

723
00:52:23,500 --> 00:52:24,940
Thank God!

724
00:52:28,220 --> 00:52:30,540
- McClane?
- Bowman.

725
00:52:36,020 --> 00:52:39,260
The satellite's down.
Get me a landline.

726
00:52:52,780 --> 00:52:56,060
One little piece of code
and the world falls apart.

727
00:52:56,660 --> 00:52:59,140
- This is virtual terrorism.
- What?

728
00:52:59,500 --> 00:53:02,780
It's crazy, the first time that I
heard of a Fire Sale

729
00:53:02,860 --> 00:53:06,060
I actually thought it would be cool,
if somebody did it.

730
00:53:07,220 --> 00:53:09,540
Hit the "reset" button...

731
00:53:10,140 --> 00:53:12,420
melt the system, just for fun.

732
00:53:13,020 --> 00:53:14,900
Hey, it is not a system.

733
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:17,260
It is a country. We are
talking about people.

734
00:53:17,380 --> 00:53:19,300
A whole country, full of people.

735
00:53:19,340 --> 00:53:20,700
Sitting at home, alone...

736
00:53:20,740 --> 00:53:22,540
scared to death in
their houses, alright.

737
00:53:22,580 --> 00:53:24,500
So if you are done with
your little nostalgic moment...

738
00:53:24,580 --> 00:53:28,420
maybe you can think a little
and help me catch these guys.

739
00:53:28,540 --> 00:53:30,060
Just help me.

740
00:53:30,260 --> 00:53:32,260
Just put yourself in their shoes.

741
00:53:33,460 --> 00:53:34,580
Come on.

742
00:53:34,660 --> 00:53:37,940
if this were your Fire Sale,
what would be your next move?

743
00:53:39,860 --> 00:53:44,220
OK, the point of a Fire Sale is that it
is mostly done by remote, right...

744
00:53:44,340 --> 00:53:46,900
But not everything is run
completely on-line.

745
00:53:47,020 --> 00:53:49,820
Major utilities aren't,
they are run in closed circuits...

746
00:53:49,940 --> 00:53:51,860
you can breech the security
up to a certain point, but...

747
00:53:51,900 --> 00:53:56,460
to shut it down you would have
to physically go there...

748
00:53:57,820 --> 00:53:59,300
You know what, give me that guys PDA.

749
00:53:59,300 --> 00:54:00,860
The phones don't work,
they are all dead.

750
00:54:00,980 --> 00:54:02,900
No the phones are fine
it is the network that is dead.

751
00:54:02,900 --> 00:54:04,820
I only need to reprogram it...

752
00:54:04,820 --> 00:54:07,940
and link it into the old sat-coms,
hackers surf them the whole time.

753
00:54:08,060 --> 00:54:10,460
It is probably what these guys are
using to talk to each other.

754
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:12,940
How do you know all this stuff?

755
00:54:12,980 --> 00:54:14,700
Dude, I don't know.

756
00:54:14,980 --> 00:54:16,980
I couldn't explain it to you.

757
00:54:17,100 --> 00:54:18,060
OK.

758
00:54:18,260 --> 00:54:19,860
The national power grid,
gas and the electricity...

759
00:54:19,900 --> 00:54:21,100
they are divided in to
three zones, right?

760
00:54:21,140 --> 00:54:24,620
Eastern, Central and Western.
Each one with a primary hub.

761
00:54:24,980 --> 00:54:26,380
Here it is.

762
00:54:28,860 --> 00:54:31,620
- What is that, what am I looking at?
- That is the eastern hub.

763
00:54:31,740 --> 00:54:33,620
Now, they take this out...

764
00:54:33,660 --> 00:54:35,940
It wipes out all the power
for the entire eastern corridor.

765
00:54:36,540 --> 00:54:38,460
But again they will have to
do it manually.

766
00:54:38,460 --> 00:54:40,820
OK.

767
00:54:41,340 --> 00:54:44,060
- Come on, let's go.
- What, to West Virgínia?

768
00:54:44,180 --> 00:54:46,580
I honestly don't think I can handle
any more people trying to kill me.

769
00:54:46,660 --> 00:54:48,900
- McClane, McClane?
- Oh you get used to it.

770
00:54:49,020 --> 00:54:50,380
McClane. Oh, shit!

771
00:54:51,020 --> 00:54:54,660
Sir, wireless networks are down
they are hitting the landlines too.

772
00:54:54,780 --> 00:54:57,700
I don't care how,
you find me a line.

773
00:54:58,140 --> 00:54:59,460
Come on, what you got?

774
00:54:59,540 --> 00:55:01,460
We swept the whole building,
It seems clean. We can...

775
00:55:01,460 --> 00:55:03,380
- sweep it again, but...
- Don't bother.

776
00:55:03,380 --> 00:55:04,900
Don't bother.

777
00:55:05,380 --> 00:55:08,540
It is fake. These guys planned this...

778
00:55:09,140 --> 00:55:11,940
Alright get everybody back
inside the crisis centre, now.

779
00:55:12,060 --> 00:55:14,340
Let's open it up!

780
00:55:15,380 --> 00:55:16,740
Come on, get in.

781
00:55:17,020 --> 00:55:21,900
The door is locked. Unless
you have an extra gun to unlock it.

782
00:55:24,060 --> 00:55:25,340
Hey, don't do that.

783
00:55:25,340 --> 00:55:27,260
You're gonna disable it... Shit.

784
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:31,820
Wow, crazy, did you see that?

785
00:55:32,660 --> 00:55:36,740
Sorry about that man.
I didn't know it would come out so fast.

786
00:55:40,340 --> 00:55:41,740
How did you do yours?

787
00:55:44,180 --> 00:55:47,180
Are you alright? What,
did it hit you a little bit.

788
00:55:47,380 --> 00:55:48,340
Sorry.

789
00:55:52,860 --> 00:55:54,620
Please, don't touch those, OK?
I know what am doing.

790
00:55:54,820 --> 00:55:56,300
I have done this before.

791
00:55:56,420 --> 00:55:58,740
I mean, I have read about it.

792
00:55:59,540 --> 00:56:02,380
Road Assist we have detected
an airbag deployment.

793
00:56:02,460 --> 00:56:04,340
Yes erm! Please, we hit a tree...

794
00:56:04,380 --> 00:56:06,300
and my Dad is having
a heart attack...

795
00:56:06,300 --> 00:56:09,060
I think he is gonna die.
You need to help us!

796
00:56:09,180 --> 00:56:11,900
Hold while we contact
the Emergency Services.

797
00:56:12,020 --> 00:56:13,540
No no no! He is dying!

798
00:56:13,580 --> 00:56:15,700
Please, listen to me. I can take him
to the hospital, I can drive.

799
00:56:15,700 --> 00:56:19,100
I am fine! But the key doesn't turn.

800
00:56:19,100 --> 00:56:21,900
So you have to start the
car for us OK? Please, Dad...

801
00:56:21,900 --> 00:56:24,060
Your name, please?

802
00:56:24,900 --> 00:56:27,260
My name is...

803
00:56:27,340 --> 00:56:30,660
Frank and my Dad's name is...

804
00:56:34,020 --> 00:56:37,700
Dvorak Tsargentzki!

805
00:56:39,500 --> 00:56:42,220
Please,  just help us! We need
your help, please!

806
00:56:42,340 --> 00:56:44,420
The Emergency Services are on their way.

807
00:56:44,740 --> 00:56:46,660
No no no! Listen, mam.

808
00:56:46,660 --> 00:56:48,180
- What is your name?
- Dolores.

809
00:56:48,180 --> 00:56:49,980
Dolores? OK, Dolores...

810
00:56:50,100 --> 00:56:51,420
I don't know if you have a Dad...

811
00:56:51,420 --> 00:56:52,620
but I do...

812
00:56:52,740 --> 00:56:54,860
And I want to be able
to say that a year from now, OK?

813
00:56:54,860 --> 00:56:56,660
Because my Dad is my
hero and right now he is...

814
00:56:56,780 --> 00:56:59,100
in my arms, dying and...

815
00:56:59,100 --> 00:57:00,580
and his only hope is...

816
00:57:00,580 --> 00:57:02,540
to get to a hospital right now!
We can't wait!

817
00:57:02,540 --> 00:57:06,260
So, please!
Start the God damn car!

818
00:57:09,700 --> 00:57:10,900
Thank you, Dolores.

819
00:57:10,940 --> 00:57:13,420
Pass the P.D.A.
I gotta call the Warlock.

820
00:57:13,500 --> 00:57:16,820
- The what?
- Warlock, he is a digital jedi.

821
00:57:34,660 --> 00:57:35,660
Mam you are not authorised
to be here.

822
00:57:35,660 --> 00:57:38,260
F.B.I. We suspect there has
been a security breech.

823
00:57:38,260 --> 00:57:41,100
You have landed without authorisation.

824
00:57:58,620 --> 00:58:03,220
- That was pretty good back there, kid.
- Thanks.

825
00:58:03,380 --> 00:58:07,740
- What’s the matter, nothing to complain about?
- No, just.......

826
00:58:09,100 --> 00:58:12,380
- What? What's the problem?
- I'm not like you,

827
00:58:12,380 --> 00:58:14,180
I can't do this shit.

828
00:58:14,220 --> 00:58:18,740
- What does that mean? Like what?
- Like... heroic and everything.

829
00:58:20,300 --> 00:58:21,500
I am not that guy.

830
00:58:21,500 --> 00:58:25,020
- Nobody here is a hero, kid.
- You saved my life like 10 times,

831
00:58:25,100 --> 00:58:26,100
in the last six hours.

832
00:58:26,100 --> 00:58:28,100
I was doing my job, that's all.

833
00:58:30,860 --> 00:58:34,900
Do you know what you get for being a hero?
Nothing! You get shot at.

834
00:58:34,900 --> 00:58:38,900
Pat on the back, bla
bla bla. That a boy!

835
00:58:41,980 --> 00:58:43,860
You get divorced...

836
00:58:44,220 --> 00:58:49,900
Your wife can't remember your last name,
kids don't want to talk to you...

837
00:58:50,980 --> 00:58:53,740
You get to eat a lot of meals by yourself.

838
00:58:53,940 --> 00:58:56,980
Trust me kid, nobody
wants to be that guy.

839
00:58:57,740 --> 00:59:02,020
- Then why you doing this?
- Because there is nobody else to do it right now.

840
00:59:02,100 --> 00:59:03,700
Believe me if there was
somebody else to do it

841
00:59:03,700 --> 00:59:07,780
i would let them do it.
There's not, so we're doing it.

842
00:59:09,740 --> 00:59:12,420
That's what makes you that guy.

843
00:59:20,260 --> 00:59:21,900
The things flying now.

844
00:59:21,940 --> 00:59:25,660
Contact Emerson, tell him that
we will be there soon.

845
00:59:31,380 --> 00:59:35,380
What the hell are you doing?
This floor is restricted access.

846
00:59:58,800 --> 01:00:00,000
You stay here.

847
01:00:48,760 --> 01:00:51,200
- We are in.
- Good, shut it down.

848
01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:02,920
I guess you were right, kid.

849
01:01:02,920 --> 01:01:04,880
OK... that's awful.

850
01:01:07,440 --> 01:01:08,560
We got company.

851
01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:20,200
So how would they
shut down the power?

852
01:01:20,200 --> 01:01:22,120
- what?
- Come on!

853
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,080
Central control Room.

854
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:30,200
- Fourth floor, fourth floor!
- Come on!

855
01:01:40,120 --> 01:01:41,120
Shit!

856
01:01:43,360 --> 01:01:44,960
- Try to keep up!
- I am keeping up!

857
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:47,880
I am just trying to stop for
just two seconds to catch a breath.

858
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:52,440
- They have these things called Gymnasiums...
- Well yeah, it's not like...

859
01:02:10,640 --> 01:02:13,320
Come on! Let's go! Let's go!

860
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:28,120
Intel is fairly certain that
the terrorists are mobile.

861
01:02:28,120 --> 01:02:31,360
It is the only way to consistently
avoid signal triangulation.

862
01:02:31,360 --> 01:02:33,240
Judging by the amount of hardware
they are running,

863
01:02:33,240 --> 01:02:35,640
we are probably looking for
a large vehicle,

864
01:02:35,640 --> 01:02:37,880
probably a semi-trailer rig.

865
01:02:37,880 --> 01:02:38,720
Right.

866
01:02:38,720 --> 01:02:40,320
Tell the guys at
Homeland Security...

867
01:02:40,320 --> 01:02:43,360
that we need every agent and
functioning satellite they have got.

868
01:02:43,360 --> 01:02:44,360
Now!

869
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:04,480
Playtime is over sweetheart

870
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:07,600
Don't move! Take your
hand off the gun.

871
01:03:07,640 --> 01:03:10,320
Hands up. Stand up.

872
01:03:16,840 --> 01:03:18,560
Go on, now!

873
01:03:19,360 --> 01:03:22,040
Let's go, kid! You're up!

874
01:03:24,800 --> 01:03:26,760
As fast as you can.

875
01:03:46,640 --> 01:03:51,160
That's enough of this Kung-Fu shit
I've met some bitches in my day...

876
01:03:51,160 --> 01:03:53,120
but you...

877
01:03:58,240 --> 01:03:59,720
Still awake, huh?

878
01:04:00,320 --> 01:04:02,360
- Keep doing what you are doing.
- OK!

879
01:04:02,360 --> 01:04:05,480
- How much time do you need?
- Not much.

880
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:19,160
Are you done?

881
01:04:19,840 --> 01:04:21,040
Are you done?

882
01:04:21,120 --> 01:04:22,880
No... no, not quite...

883
01:04:23,080 --> 01:04:26,480
I am not exactly checking
my email here, you know.

884
01:04:26,520 --> 01:04:29,560
I ran this hacking PN mode on their
PI, I am just booting their host...

885
01:04:29,560 --> 01:04:32,760
- what?
- It means about 30 seconds, ok?

886
01:04:33,520 --> 01:04:36,960
It is not the easiest thing
to do, when...

887
01:04:47,480 --> 01:04:48,760
OK.

888
01:04:50,480 --> 01:04:53,680
- Undo everything you just did, now!
- OK, OK...

889
01:04:55,240 --> 01:04:59,000
I'm a righty I need my other hand.
I really do.

890
01:05:00,680 --> 01:05:02,200
I'm a righty...

891
01:05:33,300 --> 01:05:35,380
One last door to open.

892
01:05:36,340 --> 01:05:40,620
Do you know what you are doing?
Do you realise what this'll do to the country?

893
01:05:40,620 --> 01:05:43,620
Yes, I do. Now open the door.

894
01:05:43,820 --> 01:05:48,020
OK good. Glad we are
on the same page.

895
01:06:11,620 --> 01:06:13,220
How you doin’?

896
01:06:22,500 --> 01:06:23,700
Hang on!

897
01:07:34,820 --> 01:07:37,020
Let's just talk about
this for once...

898
01:07:40,860 --> 01:07:44,700
How you doing? That's
not too tight is it?

899
01:07:46,500 --> 01:07:47,660
Damn it!

900
01:07:50,540 --> 01:07:52,060
Great!

901
01:08:25,300 --> 01:08:26,900
McClane!

902
01:08:28,300 --> 01:08:29,660
Shit!

903
01:08:30,780 --> 01:08:32,500
McClane, get out of there!

904
01:08:34,340 --> 01:08:36,100
Come on man, come on!

905
01:08:39,940 --> 01:08:41,340
Come on man!

906
01:09:01,620 --> 01:09:03,900
Did you see that?

907
01:09:07,020 --> 01:09:08,820
- So you stopped her, right?
- Yeah yeah yeah.

908
01:09:08,820 --> 01:09:12,020
Actually having a gun pointed at
your head makes it harder to do.

909
01:09:12,020 --> 01:09:15,140
- what?
- I think she left a surprise.

910
01:09:18,380 --> 01:09:20,660
Can't you just turn it off?
Lock 'em out?

911
01:09:20,660 --> 01:09:22,140
I'm not sure.

912
01:09:23,820 --> 01:09:27,060
I might be able to slow
them down though.

913
01:09:28,460 --> 01:09:32,500
Western and central hubs are
ours, we are just waiting on Mai.

914
01:09:32,500 --> 01:09:34,460
Hang on, something's up.

915
01:09:34,460 --> 01:09:37,260
All of the security is
reactivating.

916
01:09:37,260 --> 01:09:41,180
I think somebody is in the
market for some cheap Viagra...

917
01:09:41,180 --> 01:09:44,220
and your girlfriend is dead...

918
01:09:44,220 --> 01:09:47,580
why not check out our sexy
singles you can chat with.

919
01:09:47,580 --> 01:09:49,300
It's an e-bomb.

920
01:10:00,860 --> 01:10:02,340
Alright, wait wait wait, OK

921
01:10:05,580 --> 01:10:08,740
- Mai, talk to me what's going on?
- Mai...

922
01:10:09,780 --> 01:10:13,380
Oh, yeah, little Asian chick,
likes to kick people?

923
01:10:13,380 --> 01:10:17,300
I don't think she will be talking
with anybody for a long time.

924
01:10:17,420 --> 01:10:19,860
The last time that I saw her,
she was in the...

925
01:10:19,860 --> 01:10:23,180
bottom of an elevator shaft
with an SUV up her ass.

926
01:10:23,180 --> 01:10:26,140
What's the matter?
Cat got your tongue?

927
01:10:26,460 --> 01:10:30,620
Listen, Jackass! Your
Fire Sale is over.

928
01:10:31,540 --> 01:10:35,740
Pack up your little circus or
I will come and kick your ass.

929
01:10:35,740 --> 01:10:41,660
You have idea who
I am and of what I am capable of.

930
01:10:41,900 --> 01:10:44,580
When I'm finished here and
I promise it will be soon...

931
01:10:44,580 --> 01:10:48,020
I will focus all
my attention on you.

932
01:10:49,420 --> 01:10:52,260
You wanna make things personal,
fine!

933
01:11:11,220 --> 01:11:16,260
Reroute every cubic foot of natural gas
in the pipelines to that station.

934
01:11:16,580 --> 01:11:19,700
- Can you get Bowman on this thing?
- Sure.,,

935
01:11:20,140 --> 01:11:22,820
- can get anyone.
- Do it.

936
01:11:22,820 --> 01:11:24,700
- Now?
- Yes, now.

937
01:11:27,820 --> 01:11:29,380
Please, no!

938
01:11:30,540 --> 01:11:33,020
- That is Thomas Gabriel.
- Shit!

939
01:11:33,900 --> 01:11:37,260
- You know this guy?
- I worked with him.

940
01:11:37,780 --> 01:11:41,020
He was D.O.D.s chief programmer
for infrastructure security.

941
01:11:41,020 --> 01:11:43,900
After 9/11, he's the guy
that told joint chiefs...

942
01:11:43,900 --> 01:11:47,380
that the system was vulnerable. He was pushing for
total overhaul, but they wouldn't listen.

943
01:11:47,380 --> 01:11:50,500
- Gabriel is not exactly people friendly.
- You think so?

944
01:11:51,260 --> 01:11:55,100
When he tried to go public they
crucified him, destroyed his reputation,

945
01:11:55,100 --> 01:11:57,820
after that he disappeared.

946
01:11:57,980 --> 01:12:00,700
We got a pretty serious problem.

947
01:12:00,860 --> 01:12:02,340
Hold on a minute, what?

948
01:12:02,340 --> 01:12:05,420
I think we need to get out
of here, right now.

949
01:12:06,700 --> 01:12:09,660
- They are sending the gas lines here.
- Gas? What gas?

950
01:12:09,660 --> 01:12:10,980
Christ!

951
01:12:12,220 --> 01:12:13,860
Oh, all of them!

952
01:12:13,860 --> 01:12:17,260
See that? Those flashing arrows?
That is not good.

953
01:12:17,260 --> 01:12:20,140
- All that's coming here?
- Yes, I think we gotta go.

954
01:12:20,140 --> 01:12:23,420
Listen, I gotta go.
Just find Thomas Gabriel!

955
01:12:23,420 --> 01:12:25,460
McClane? McClane?

956
01:12:25,940 --> 01:12:28,220
Let's go, finish this up!

957
01:12:33,620 --> 01:12:36,340
Right now,
Come on!

958
01:12:55,220 --> 01:12:56,500
Get in there!

959
01:13:46,380 --> 01:13:48,700
Let's go, come on,
we gotta get out of here.

960
01:13:48,700 --> 01:13:50,700
Oh what is the point, oh man,
what is the point?

961
01:13:50,860 --> 01:13:55,660
Hey, knock that off. This has something
to do with that code you wrote, now think.

962
01:13:55,660 --> 01:13:58,820
- Come on, help us win.
- Win?!

963
01:13:59,540 --> 01:14:01,940
When did we start winning, huh?

964
01:14:01,940 --> 01:14:06,260
Look around, are you out of your mind?
We are not even close to winning.

965
01:14:06,260 --> 01:14:08,980
We just got the
shit kicked out of us!

966
01:14:09,180 --> 01:14:12,940
You think I'm holding out on you,
something I'm not telling you

967
01:14:12,940 --> 01:14:15,940
- I would happily tell you!
- Jesus!

968
01:14:52,040 --> 01:14:57,921
Warlock, Warlock!
Ah great, there goes the cell phone.

969
01:14:58,040 --> 01:15:01,120
- They knocked the satellites out now?
- No, the battery ran out.

970
01:15:01,120 --> 01:15:03,120
- Listen we should go see him.
- Who?

971
01:15:03,120 --> 01:15:06,080
The Warlock, it's not that far
away, it's in Baltimore.

972
01:15:06,080 --> 01:15:10,160
- You want to go to the Warlocks house, now.
- Hey, this is me helping you.

973
01:15:10,160 --> 01:15:14,360
Trust me. We gotta go see the Warlock
it is our only hope.

974
01:15:18,800 --> 01:15:23,240
- How do you feel about flying?
- You mean like, with a pilot?

975
01:15:30,360 --> 01:15:32,800
- Stick it in the round thing.
- What round thing?

976
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:34,680
Here, put these on.

977
01:15:35,880 --> 01:15:38,280
Stick it in there, that'll work.

978
01:15:38,320 --> 01:15:42,400
- You OK?
- Yeah, err, I am afraid of flying.

979
01:15:42,400 --> 01:15:45,240
- Yeah I used to be terrified of flying.
- Really?

980
01:15:45,240 --> 01:15:48,160
I took some lessons, you know,
face my fears, that kind of thing...

981
01:15:48,160 --> 01:15:50,320
- Yeah, did it help?
- Not really.

982
01:15:51,440 --> 01:15:52,680
That's it...

983
01:15:55,400 --> 01:15:58,080
- Is it supposed to make that sound?
- Yes.

984
01:16:00,040 --> 01:16:02,240
Maybe we should just drive,
it'll be fun like a road trip...

985
01:16:02,240 --> 01:16:04,520
Take it easy, they say taking
off is the hardest part.

986
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:05,720
Really, I'd heard...

987
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:09,840
- I'll be honest, I missed some classes.
- Ha Ha, you did? Really?

988
01:16:09,840 --> 01:16:13,160
You got your license, right?
To fly one of these things...

989
01:16:15,080 --> 01:16:18,480
Hey hey.
Here we go, we're up!

990
01:16:24,320 --> 01:16:26,720
That's good, that's
pretty good.

991
01:16:28,160 --> 01:16:31,800
Jesus! Look at that! This
whole area's blacked out.

992
01:16:33,120 --> 01:16:35,560
How will we find Warlocks house?

993
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:40,520
It will probably be the only one
with the lights still on.

994
01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:50,520
Power outage keeps spreading,
half the east coast has gone down.

995
01:16:51,680 --> 01:16:54,000
Alright, put everything
on emergency generators.

996
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,760
How the hell are they
getting past us?

997
01:17:01,320 --> 01:17:03,080
- OK, down there, I see it.
- Down there?

998
01:17:03,080 --> 01:17:04,440
Left, left, down.

999
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:10,720
We gonna land there?

1000
01:17:12,400 --> 01:17:14,640
- Alright, hang on.
- Oh, Jesus!

1001
01:17:17,960 --> 01:17:19,240
The fence! The fence!

1002
01:17:21,400 --> 01:17:23,520
- The fence! The fence!
- I see it...

1003
01:17:23,520 --> 01:17:24,840
Watch...

1004
01:17:36,600 --> 01:17:38,960
- wooow!
- Come on.

1005
01:17:38,960 --> 01:17:42,840
- Oh yeah, taking off is the hardest part.
- Let's go!

1006
01:17:45,560 --> 01:17:49,520
There’s something you need to know
about Warlock, he hates cops...

1007
01:17:49,520 --> 01:17:53,040
he hates them, so let
me do all the talking.

1008
01:18:03,880 --> 01:18:07,800
Hey Mrs. Kludis.
Is Freddy home?

1009
01:18:09,640 --> 01:18:14,040
I am Matt Farrell and that is Billy.

1010
01:18:15,720 --> 01:18:17,960
We are friends from Space Camp.

1011
01:18:17,960 --> 01:18:21,200
We went to Space Camp with Freddy.

1012
01:18:21,200 --> 01:18:22,520
Freddy!

1013
01:18:23,160 --> 01:18:25,880
- Freddy?
- You got company.

1014
01:18:31,840 --> 01:18:34,520
Frederick, didn't you hear me?

1015
01:18:34,680 --> 01:18:37,920
- All Baltimore heard you, ma.
- Your friends are here.

1016
01:18:37,920 --> 01:18:40,000
Friends? But what the...

1017
01:18:40,480 --> 01:18:44,560
Ma, how many times, you don't
bring people down here?

1018
01:18:44,560 --> 01:18:49,360
I can't see too well, you have
lost so much weight!

1019
01:18:49,360 --> 01:18:51,360
No, dude I gained 30 lbs,
who is that?

1020
01:18:51,360 --> 01:18:54,160
You know what it doesn't matter?
What are you even doing here?

1021
01:18:54,160 --> 01:18:57,480
I am rocking 5 generators just
so I can stay online.

1022
01:18:57,480 --> 01:19:01,160
And since you are being hunted by
assassins, maybe this visit

1023
01:19:01,160 --> 01:19:03,600
isn't a  productive or a healthy way
of spending my time.

1024
01:19:03,600 --> 01:19:07,520
- Hey, don't touch that alright?
- CB radio?

1025
01:19:08,200 --> 01:19:11,400
- A little low tech for you isn't it?
- Old? That my friend...

1026
01:19:11,400 --> 01:19:13,720
is an end of the world
insurance system, OK.

1027
01:19:13,720 --> 01:19:15,520
When the last microchip is down
I will be able to...

1028
01:19:15,520 --> 01:19:18,600
be in contact with the world,
be they zombies or not.

1029
01:19:18,600 --> 01:19:19,600
I'll tell you that right now.

1030
01:19:19,600 --> 01:19:23,120
- What did you bring your Dad here for?
- He is cool, he's into games.

1031
01:19:23,120 --> 01:19:28,040
- Nice poster.
- Oh, what are you, a fan of Fett?

1032
01:19:28,040 --> 01:19:34,080
- No, I was more of a Star Wars guy.
- Star Wars! Who is this man?

1033
01:19:34,080 --> 01:19:35,080
He is...

1034
01:19:35,080 --> 01:19:38,960
Dump-truck, I'm not his Dad,
I am a cop. How about that?

1035
01:19:38,960 --> 01:19:41,680
Ah, a cop, I'm sorry.
Thank you very much.

1036
01:19:41,680 --> 01:19:44,040
Why'd you bring a cop into
my Command Centre?

1037
01:19:44,040 --> 01:19:47,880
- Command Centre?! It is a basement.
- It is a Command Centre!

1038
01:19:47,880 --> 01:19:49,520
Don't help, McClane!
I can explain...

1039
01:19:49,520 --> 01:19:52,960
Tell us what you know about Thomas
Gabriel. That's why we came here.

1040
01:19:52,960 --> 01:19:55,560
Thomas Gabriel, that's cool,
I didn't know. I'm sorry.

1041
01:19:55,560 --> 01:19:58,400
Get out, I want you out of here,
man, right now!

1042
01:19:58,400 --> 01:19:59,480
Hey, calm down.

1043
01:19:59,480 --> 01:20:02,600
- Just calm down big boy.
- You calm down, it's my house!

1044
01:20:03,360 --> 01:20:09,480
You are going to tell me what I wanna know.
Or I'm gonna kill you in your own house.

1045
01:20:21,640 --> 01:20:24,040
4 years ago the D.O.D.
recruits Thomas Gabriel...

1046
01:20:24,040 --> 01:20:25,560
to be a cyber spook for them, OK.

1047
01:20:25,560 --> 01:20:27,840
First day on the job he
goes and tells his bosses...

1048
01:20:27,840 --> 01:20:31,600
that the nations security infrastructure
is wide open to compromise .

1049
01:20:31,600 --> 01:20:34,160
And what did they say?
"We will take it under advisement."

1050
01:20:34,160 --> 01:20:36,960
But he doesn't ease up 'cos he is
committed, like you read about.

1051
01:20:36,960 --> 01:20:39,680
So he breaks into a meeting
of the Joint chiefs of Staff, OK?

1052
01:20:39,680 --> 01:20:42,840
Using just a laptop he
hacks into NORAD

1053
01:20:42,840 --> 01:20:44,240
and shuts down the
entire defence network

1054
01:20:44,240 --> 01:20:47,720
So they put a gun to his head
and forced him to stop the hack,

1055
01:20:47,720 --> 01:20:50,640
Thomas Gabriel is the guy who
shut down NORAD with a laptop,

1056
01:20:50,640 --> 01:20:53,520
just to prove a point,
you think I'm scared of you?

1057
01:20:53,520 --> 01:20:56,360
- Just tell us how to find the guy.
- I don't know how, he is a ghost.

1058
01:20:56,360 --> 01:20:57,840
He just fell off the grid.

1059
01:20:58,040 --> 01:21:00,200
- Another dead end, come on.
- Hold on wait, McClane,

1060
01:21:00,200 --> 01:21:03,280
Listen, Warlock, a couple of
weeks ago I wrote this...

1061
01:21:03,280 --> 01:21:05,960
I know dude, you wrote a mutating
algorithm security code

1062
01:21:05,960 --> 01:21:08,400
that's probably being used
right now by Thomas Gabriel.

1063
01:21:08,400 --> 01:21:10,280
No, we know that, yes.

1064
01:21:10,280 --> 01:21:13,840
- Can you tell us what he's using it for?
- I've been trying to figure that out..

1065
01:21:12,240 --> 01:21:13,280
Here, look...

1066
01:21:15,360 --> 01:21:19,240
The only system I can find
using that kind of security,

1067
01:21:19,240 --> 01:21:22,360
is the Social Security
Administration, OK.

1068
01:21:22,360 --> 01:21:25,000
They don't even use it
in the main facility, look.

1069
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:28,120
They use it in this building,
over here, Woodlawn.

1070
01:21:28,880 --> 01:21:30,320
What the hell...

1071
01:21:30,520 --> 01:21:32,000
- I know, right?
- Right, what?

1072
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:33,240
What the hell you guys
talking about?

1073
01:21:33,240 --> 01:21:34,960
The power consumption is off the charts.

1074
01:21:34,960 --> 01:21:35,800
It's hot, on fire.

1075
01:21:35,800 --> 01:21:38,280
- The chilling towers?
- That's what I thought.

1076
01:21:40,120 --> 01:21:44,320
- Hello, what's a chilling tower?
- Jees, see what I've been dealing with?

1077
01:21:44,720 --> 01:21:48,800
Large server farms generate a
lot of heat, they need to be cooled.

1078
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:49,600
Why there?

1079
01:21:49,600 --> 01:21:54,440
I don't know what is in that building but I
assure you it's not Social Security numbers.

1080
01:21:59,400 --> 01:22:04,080
I have a red flag over here,
someone's hacking into Woodlawn.

1081
01:22:05,160 --> 01:22:10,520
Tracking IP on the server now...
Frederick Kaludis.

1082
01:22:10,920 --> 01:22:13,320
- Let's take a look at him.
- Fat bastard!

1083
01:22:18,640 --> 01:22:21,360
McClane. Where is his daughter?

1084
01:22:21,560 --> 01:22:23,480
We just got a trace on her cell.

1085
01:22:23,480 --> 01:22:25,000
You're gonna love this.

1086
01:22:30,200 --> 01:22:32,760
Alright let's get
a better look at you.

1087
01:22:43,720 --> 01:22:48,240
Freddy, what the hell are you
doing, meddling in my network?

1088
01:22:53,360 --> 01:22:56,560
McClane? I thought
I'd killed you already.

1089
01:22:57,200 --> 01:22:58,960
I get that sometimes.

1090
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:05,080
Do you think you can
track where he is?

1091
01:23:05,880 --> 01:23:10,480
Detective, covering the camera with
your hand, doesn't turn off the microphone.

1092
01:23:11,400 --> 01:23:16,840
I know that am not as smart as
you guys and this computer shit.

1093
01:23:17,440 --> 01:23:21,080
But hey, I'm still
alive aint I?

1094
01:23:21,600 --> 01:23:25,520
I mean you got to be running
outta bad guys by now, right?

1095
01:23:29,760 --> 01:23:31,200
Gabriel?

1096
01:23:33,560 --> 01:23:36,160
Honestly, you can tell me.
How's that work?

1097
01:23:36,160 --> 01:23:41,280
Is it some kind of service or something?
Some kind of 1-800 number, 1-800 henchmen?

1098
01:23:41,520 --> 01:23:43,200
I bet you are still
on hold waiting :

1099
01:23:43,200 --> 01:23:46,800
"Get another dead Asian hooker
bitch over here right away?"

1100
01:23:48,760 --> 01:23:52,800
But seriously, all that kicking
aside, that skinny ninja chick...

1101
01:23:52,800 --> 01:23:54,200
she was smoking hot.

1102
01:23:54,960 --> 01:23:57,880
Another one of those is gonna be
real hard to come by, right?

1103
01:23:57,880 --> 01:24:01,880
- You're very impressed with yourself, aren't you?
- I have my moments.

1104
01:24:01,840 --> 01:24:02,640
Yeah?

1105
01:24:04,880 --> 01:24:06,800
Is this one of them?

1106
01:24:11,200 --> 01:24:14,360
- Hello?
- Yes, Emergency Services calling.

1107
01:24:14,480 --> 01:24:16,400
- Oh, thank God.
- Can she hear me?

1108
01:24:16,400 --> 01:24:18,680
My name is Lucy Gennero, I have been
stuck for hours, been trying to call...

1109
01:24:18,680 --> 01:24:20,520
- my cell phone’s not working...
- Can she hear this?

1110
01:24:20,520 --> 01:24:22,760
Lucy, hang up that phone.

1111
01:24:22,760 --> 01:24:26,240
Calm down miss.
We know exactly where you are.

1112
01:24:26,600 --> 01:24:29,320
- Everything will be alright.
- Lucy, hang up the phone!

1113
01:24:29,880 --> 01:24:33,280
Please, John, I am
trying to have a conversation.

1114
01:24:35,240 --> 01:24:39,080
we are a bit overloaded
tonight, as you may imagine,

1115
01:24:39,080 --> 01:24:40,920
but I assure you, we are
gonna get you out of there...

1116
01:24:40,920 --> 01:24:44,080
even if I have to come down there
and get you myself.

1117
01:24:44,320 --> 01:24:45,200
Thank you.

1118
01:24:45,320 --> 01:24:48,481
In the meantime Mrs Gennero is
there anybody we can contact for you?

1119
01:24:48,660 --> 01:24:52,140
Yes, my Dad.

1120
01:24:53,100 --> 01:24:57,060
His name is John McClane,
He's a New York City cop.

1121
01:24:57,220 --> 01:25:02,140
We'll find him, just hang
in there Miss and we will get to you.

1122
01:25:02,140 --> 01:25:03,540
Very soon.

1123
01:25:04,980 --> 01:25:06,180
Thank you.

1124
01:25:07,940 --> 01:25:12,332
Wow, that's a great girl you
got there, can't wait to meet her

1125
01:25:12,700 --> 01:25:15,620
What's the matter,
cat got your tongue?

1126
01:25:15,620 --> 01:25:19,700
Come on John? Make a joke.

1127
01:25:20,620 --> 01:25:22,820
Say something funny.

1128
01:25:25,740 --> 01:25:27,180
WOODLAWN

1129
01:25:29,460 --> 01:25:32,460
Wait, where are you going?

1130
01:25:32,940 --> 01:25:36,700
Hey, hold up. Where are you going?
What are you gonna do?

1131
01:25:36,820 --> 01:25:38,620
What do you think I'm gonna do?

1132
01:25:38,740 --> 01:25:41,180
I'm gonna kill this guy
and get my daughter.

1133
01:25:41,180 --> 01:25:42,700
- But she can be...
- No, listen to me.

1134
01:25:42,700 --> 01:25:45,260
It's gonna get messy,
You should just stay here.

1135
01:25:45,260 --> 01:25:48,180
- I think I...
- Hey, I'm doing you a favour.

1136
01:25:48,180 --> 01:25:50,300
I wouldn't bet on me, alright?

1137
01:25:50,300 --> 01:25:54,140
I'll take it from here.
Thanks for the help.

1138
01:26:00,146 --> 01:26:05,386
I wouldn't bet on you either,
so I guess I'll give you a hand.

1139
01:26:06,426 --> 01:26:07,386
OK.

1140
01:26:34,906 --> 01:26:36,415
F.B.I. mam,
Jersey  Field Office.

1141
01:26:36,306 --> 01:26:38,706
Mind if I see your ID?

1142
01:26:38,706 --> 01:26:39,986
Not at all.

1143
01:26:49,306 --> 01:26:52,026
My father is a cop, force of habit.

1144
01:26:52,186 --> 01:26:55,386
Your father sounds like
a very smart man.

1145
01:26:59,746 --> 01:27:03,546
- kid, can you get Bowman?
- Err, yeah.

1146
01:27:13,346 --> 01:27:15,146
It's completely dead.

1147
01:27:15,426 --> 01:27:19,746
Gabriel must have shut down
all of the satellite links. Shit!

1148
01:27:23,986 --> 01:27:26,426
I'm sorry about Lucy, man.

1149
01:27:29,066 --> 01:27:30,346
all of it...

1150
01:27:30,806 --> 01:27:33,766
It is my fault you got into this,
this wasn't your fight.

1151
01:27:33,766 --> 01:27:36,086
You have nothing to be sorry about.

1152
01:27:40,446 --> 01:27:41,646
Bastard!

1153
01:27:41,646 --> 01:27:43,246
This bitch is a handful.

1154
01:27:48,566 --> 01:27:50,206
Are you gonna be alright?

1155
01:27:53,366 --> 01:27:55,486
Behave or I will hurt you.

1156
01:27:55,486 --> 01:27:58,486
Oh yeah? Let's step outside,
just you and me.

1157
01:27:59,166 --> 01:28:01,126
We will see who hurts who!

1158
01:28:02,206 --> 01:28:05,726
You really are his daughter.
Tie her wrists.

1159
01:28:12,646 --> 01:28:15,046
Trey! Gabriel wants to see you.

1160
01:28:15,046 --> 01:28:17,486
- Is it that time already?
- Yes.

1161
01:28:21,326 --> 01:28:23,606
I'll be back in one second.

1162
01:28:28,046 --> 01:28:29,806
Don't kill me! Please!

1163
01:29:13,626 --> 01:29:17,106
We are showing a breach
in an external vent.

1164
01:29:20,586 --> 01:29:22,186
Go take a look.

1165
01:29:23,266 --> 01:29:25,986
Don't be long, we are
packing up soon.

1166
01:29:36,746 --> 01:29:37,986
Hey, McClane!

1167
01:29:38,106 --> 01:29:40,786
Do we have anything resembling
a plan or anything?

1168
01:29:40,986 --> 01:29:42,546
To find Lucy and kill everybody else.

1169
01:29:42,546 --> 01:29:45,986
I mean like a plan,
like a way to do that.

1170
01:29:47,746 --> 01:29:49,266
Come on.

1171
01:29:50,426 --> 01:29:55,546
OK, according to the layout, the chilling
towers are kept on the bottom level.

1172
01:30:01,226 --> 01:30:02,226
It should be locked.

1173
01:30:06,506 --> 01:30:08,866
OK, now it looks like we are
getting somewhere.

1174
01:30:21,066 --> 01:30:24,106
OK this looks like it controls the
cooling system for the mainframe, which...

1175
01:30:24,106 --> 01:30:26,506
should be...

1176
01:30:27,026 --> 01:30:29,066
If I can just hack in...

1177
01:30:29,906 --> 01:30:33,306
and trip the alarm,
it might alert Bowman.

1178
01:30:41,346 --> 01:30:43,186
Somebody set off the alarms.

1179
01:30:43,266 --> 01:30:45,226
Yes, thank you detective.
I can hear that.

1180
01:30:45,226 --> 01:30:47,626
Find a way to turn it off.

1181
01:30:51,186 --> 01:30:52,666
What you got?

1182
01:30:53,666 --> 01:30:55,106
We got a problem.

1183
01:30:55,306 --> 01:30:57,626
The alarms went off at Woodlawn.

1184
01:30:58,666 --> 01:31:00,426
It's got to be him.

1185
01:31:00,986 --> 01:31:03,026
and what's, Woodlawn?

1186
01:31:06,386 --> 01:31:08,306
It's N.S.A.

1187
01:31:08,306 --> 01:31:10,786
A secure facility outside
of Baltimore.

1188
01:31:10,786 --> 01:31:13,306
It's a failsafe we built after 9/11...

1189
01:31:13,346 --> 01:31:15,546
to backup all financial information.

1190
01:31:15,546 --> 01:31:17,946
The moment the networks were hit
all the financial data...

1191
01:31:17,946 --> 01:31:20,826
it automatically began downloading
to those servers.

1192
01:31:20,826 --> 01:31:23,306
Banks, Wall Street,
Corporate Records...

1193
01:31:23,306 --> 01:31:25,546
Government funds, all of it.

1194
01:31:25,626 --> 01:31:29,506
Basically a backup for
the accumulated wealth of America.

1195
01:31:29,506 --> 01:31:31,146
All in one location?

1196
01:31:32,866 --> 01:31:35,426
- What could Gabriel do with it?
- If he could get in he might try...

1197
01:31:35,426 --> 01:31:38,626
a transfer of the data
to a portable hard drive,

1198
01:31:38,626 --> 01:31:41,026
then he can have access to
those accounts anywhere.

1199
01:31:41,026 --> 01:31:43,786
Syphon of billions for himself.

1200
01:31:43,906 --> 01:31:45,826
We would have no way to trace it.

1201
01:31:45,826 --> 01:31:48,186
But knowing him,
he could erase it all

1202
01:31:48,186 --> 01:31:51,146
and send us back to
the stone age.

1203
01:31:51,146 --> 01:31:53,546
Why the hell wasn't I
told about this?

1204
01:31:53,546 --> 01:31:55,106
Frankly...

1205
01:31:55,146 --> 01:31:58,946
- It's above your pay grade.
- My pay grade?

1206
01:32:00,786 --> 01:32:05,066
How did Gabriel find out about
this when I didn't even know?

1207
01:32:07,986 --> 01:32:09,506
He designed it.

1208
01:32:11,426 --> 01:32:13,186
It was his program.

1209
01:32:13,386 --> 01:32:18,666
He knew that hacking your system
last night would trigger the download.

1210
01:32:18,666 --> 01:32:20,106
That's brilliant!

1211
01:32:20,586 --> 01:32:23,906
You two, geniuses,
stay out of my way.

1212
01:32:28,786 --> 01:32:32,106
Let me see if I can
get a floor plan of this place.

1213
01:32:33,106 --> 01:32:34,346
Don't move!

1214
01:32:35,266 --> 01:32:37,946
You!
Get away from the bag! Now!

1215
01:32:37,946 --> 01:32:38,946
OK.

1216
01:32:39,146 --> 01:32:41,146
We’ve been waiting for you.

1217
01:32:42,226 --> 01:32:43,226
Have you?

1218
01:32:44,266 --> 01:32:46,506
I've been waiting for you too.

1219
01:33:11,586 --> 01:33:12,826
McClane!

1220
01:33:14,906 --> 01:33:15,906
McClane!

1221
01:33:18,866 --> 01:33:19,826
Kid?

1222
01:33:20,386 --> 01:33:21,386
Matt? Kid?

1223
01:33:35,666 --> 01:33:37,426
Emerson...

1224
01:33:38,106 --> 01:33:40,946
We seam to have a problem
in one of the cooling towers.

1225
01:33:40,946 --> 01:33:42,346
- Tower 7.
- Tower 7.

1226
01:33:42,346 --> 01:33:45,546
- Find out what's going on.
- I will see to it. OK.

1227
01:33:53,666 --> 01:33:54,706
Sir?

1228
01:33:54,706 --> 01:33:57,226
Get the HR team to stand by.
We need to get Woodlawn, now.

1229
01:33:57,226 --> 01:34:00,226
The roads out, completely blocked.
DC's in total gridlock.

1230
01:34:00,226 --> 01:34:02,186
Then get us some helicopters.

1231
01:34:02,186 --> 01:34:04,546
They have all been pulled by the
Pentagon, for search and rescue.

1232
01:34:04,546 --> 01:34:08,266
Molina, find me some God damned
helicopters immediately.

1233
01:34:09,386 --> 01:34:12,266
Look, the Pentagon has jets
flying cap over DC.

1234
01:34:12,266 --> 01:34:15,146
Have them send one over to Woodlawn
and keep on eye on things until we get there.

1235
01:34:15,146 --> 01:34:16,546
Let's go!

1236
01:34:27,666 --> 01:34:29,386
Where is my daughter?

1237
01:34:29,586 --> 01:34:30,986
Russo, check in.

1238
01:34:35,346 --> 01:34:39,506
I Think Russo is on his way
down to meet your girlfriend, dickhead.

1239
01:34:43,306 --> 01:34:46,186
He's on the third floor, the kid...

1240
01:34:49,186 --> 01:34:51,226
did you get all that?

1241
01:34:51,226 --> 01:34:52,906
That's right.

1242
01:34:52,946 --> 01:34:56,506
I am on the third floor,
but I'm coming to get ya.

1243
01:35:04,506 --> 01:35:07,226
Don't move, pal,
I will send a doctor.

1244
01:35:09,826 --> 01:35:13,386
Kill this guy and
I will give you Mais cut.

1245
01:35:13,706 --> 01:35:14,946
OK.

1246
01:35:57,066 --> 01:35:59,346
My algorithm.

1247
01:36:04,186 --> 01:36:05,626
Please... God.

1248
01:36:07,186 --> 01:36:09,306
Please... God.

1249
01:36:43,746 --> 01:36:46,786
My Jesus, they are
going after the money.

1250
01:37:09,466 --> 01:37:11,946
You coming to get me, John?
Is that the plan?

1251
01:37:11,946 --> 01:37:14,146
Yep, that's my plan.

1252
01:37:14,146 --> 01:37:17,386
What makes you think I wont put a
bullet in your daughter's head, right now?

1253
01:37:17,386 --> 01:37:18,746
Because you are scared of me.

1254
01:37:18,746 --> 01:37:21,306
Is that right, you think
I am afraid of you?

1255
01:37:21,306 --> 01:37:23,306
Cos otherwise she would
be dead already.

1256
01:37:23,306 --> 01:37:25,426
You need a bargaining chip.

1257
01:37:30,986 --> 01:37:33,546
Stop there! Hands up!

1258
01:37:33,546 --> 01:37:36,226
If you kill me
you'll never get it open.

1259
01:37:38,666 --> 01:37:40,506
Move away. Move!

1260
01:37:47,346 --> 01:37:51,266
You know John, I feel like
we have gotten off on the wrong foot.

1261
01:37:51,946 --> 01:37:55,266
And 'cos of that you think
I'm the bad guy,

1262
01:37:55,306 --> 01:37:58,306
Nothing could be further from the
truth, I'm the good guy here.

1263
01:37:58,306 --> 01:38:01,786
I told them this could happen
if they didn't prepare.

1264
01:38:01,786 --> 01:38:04,026
Did I get a thank you?
No, I got crucified.

1265
01:38:04,026 --> 01:38:06,746
- But they wouldn't listen.
- You got their attention now don't you?

1266
01:38:06,746 --> 01:38:08,546
That's right.

1267
01:38:09,226 --> 01:38:12,066
I am doing the country a favour.

1268
01:38:12,066 --> 01:38:13,746
Ha ha, by tearing it apart?

1269
01:38:13,746 --> 01:38:16,146
Better me than some outsider,

1270
01:38:16,466 --> 01:38:18,866
some religious nut job
bent on Armageddon.

1271
01:38:18,866 --> 01:38:20,546
Nobody wants to see
that happen.

1272
01:38:20,546 --> 01:38:23,666
Everything I've broken,
can be fixed.

1273
01:38:24,346 --> 01:38:27,546
If the country is
willing to pay for it.

1274
01:38:27,546 --> 01:38:30,426
Ah bullshit!
It's always been about the money.

1275
01:38:30,426 --> 01:38:32,826
What, I shouldn't get
paid for my work?

1276
01:38:32,826 --> 01:38:34,866
I'm workin' my ass
off here, John.

1277
01:38:34,866 --> 01:38:38,226
Just sit tight asshole,
I got a cheque for ya.

1278
01:38:40,946 --> 01:38:42,266
I can't talk to this guy.

1279
01:38:42,266 --> 01:38:46,146
You talk to him, see if
you can get him to focus.

1280
01:38:46,146 --> 01:38:47,386
Dad?

1281
01:38:49,346 --> 01:38:50,546
Hi, baby

1282
01:38:51,946 --> 01:38:53,666
Now there only 5 of them.

1283
01:38:56,306 --> 01:38:58,706
Hang on, Lucy, I'm coming.

1284
01:39:08,546 --> 01:39:11,546
Would somebody, please,
kill this son of a bitch.

1285
01:39:13,266 --> 01:39:14,546
We have a problem.

1286
01:39:15,986 --> 01:39:19,826
There actually no problem here
I just got off at the wrong floor.

1287
01:39:22,466 --> 01:39:24,066
This is a mess.

1288
01:39:26,266 --> 01:39:28,106
Wow, I'm truly impressed, man.

1289
01:39:28,106 --> 01:39:30,306
Hacking all the financial data
of the whole country would take weeks,

1290
01:39:30,306 --> 01:39:33,026
unless you eliminated the congestion.

1291
01:39:33,826 --> 01:39:37,226
That's what this Fire Sale
is about isn't it?

1292
01:39:37,226 --> 01:39:39,426
- It's brilliant.
- Yes, it is.

1293
01:39:39,426 --> 01:39:41,906
- Please, be quiet.
- Asshole.

1294
01:39:41,906 --> 01:39:44,906
- Who are you?
- Matt Farrell.

1295
01:39:45,786 --> 01:39:47,146
Lucy McClane.

1296
01:39:47,826 --> 01:39:50,146
I thought your name was Gennero.

1297
01:39:50,226 --> 01:39:51,706
Lucy Gennero?

1298
01:39:51,746 --> 01:39:54,826
- Not today.
- Can you crack the code?

1299
01:39:55,066 --> 01:39:57,386
Maybe, if I had enough time.

1300
01:39:57,626 --> 01:39:58,946
That is encouraging.

1301
01:40:00,866 --> 01:40:02,066
We take them with us.

1302
01:40:02,946 --> 01:40:05,466
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

1303
01:40:07,626 --> 01:40:10,506
Gabriel, the Pentagon just sent
an F-35 towards us.

1304
01:40:10,506 --> 01:40:11,946
Keep an eye on it.

1305
01:40:14,466 --> 01:40:17,346
Pulling the go codes now.

1306
01:40:31,586 --> 01:40:36,146
Might wanna start thinking what
you want on your headstone, asshole.

1307
01:40:42,906 --> 01:40:44,746
Damned, hamster.

1308
01:40:45,106 --> 01:40:46,146
There you go!

1309
01:40:46,466 --> 01:40:49,306
Be still, spider boy.

1310
01:40:52,786 --> 01:40:53,986
That's right!

1311
01:41:36,426 --> 01:41:40,906
Seriously, you probably shouldn't
antagonise them since they have all the guns.

1312
01:41:40,906 --> 01:41:43,586
Listen, will you just take a minute and
dig deep for a bigger set of balls...

1313
01:41:43,586 --> 01:41:45,346
Because you are going to need them
before we are through.

1314
01:41:45,346 --> 01:41:46,746
Wow, I know that tone.

1315
01:41:46,746 --> 01:41:49,946
It's just weird hearing it
from someone with hair.

1316
01:42:24,986 --> 01:42:28,386
Sir, E.T.A. 15 minutes.

1317
01:43:19,826 --> 01:43:21,346
Fix it.

1318
01:43:21,866 --> 01:43:25,466
Why? You are just going to kill me
if I fix it, I know that.

1319
01:43:32,466 --> 01:43:33,906
Shit!

1320
01:43:36,866 --> 01:43:38,426
I'm not gonna do it.

1321
01:43:43,106 --> 01:43:46,746
- No no no! Shit.
- Robertson is coming really fast.

1322
01:43:46,946 --> 01:43:48,706
- I'm sorry, what?
- Something is wrong.

1323
01:43:48,706 --> 01:43:51,066
Robertson is coming too fast.

1324
01:43:54,666 --> 01:43:55,986
It's not Robertson.

1325
01:43:56,586 --> 01:43:58,506
That would be my Dad.

1326
01:44:09,466 --> 01:44:10,506
Freddy!

1327
01:44:12,426 --> 01:44:13,546
Freddy!

1328
01:44:15,426 --> 01:44:17,866
This is John McClane.
Look I know you can hear me.

1329
01:44:17,866 --> 01:44:19,506
This is your frequency, right?

1330
01:44:19,506 --> 01:44:22,186
666. Come on pick
up the mic, Freddy.

1331
01:44:25,306 --> 01:44:27,906
Nobody here by that name, sorry.

1332
01:44:27,906 --> 01:44:29,906
Hacker jerk off!

1333
01:44:34,226 --> 01:44:35,666
Warlock!

1334
01:44:36,146 --> 01:44:39,066
I need you to do whatever
it is that you do...

1335
01:44:39,066 --> 01:44:41,066
to patch me through
to the F.B.I.

1336
01:44:41,066 --> 01:44:44,186
To Deputy Director Bowman,
you hear me?

1337
01:44:44,466 --> 01:44:47,826
Are you serious, you want me
to intentionally open up a com...

1338
01:44:47,826 --> 01:44:52,186
line to the head of the C.I.A.
cyber division? I don't think so.

1339
01:44:52,186 --> 01:44:55,466
Freddy, God damn it!
They have my daughter!

1340
01:44:59,226 --> 01:45:01,066
I can do that, hold on.

1341
01:45:02,706 --> 01:45:03,706
Thank you.

1342
01:45:10,426 --> 01:45:14,266
This is central, we have a
patch for Director Bowman.

1343
01:45:14,266 --> 01:45:17,466
Sir, central is trying to
reach you.

1344
01:45:18,546 --> 01:45:19,786
Go.

1345
01:45:19,866 --> 01:45:21,986
- Bowman, it's McClane.
- McClane.

1346
01:45:21,986 --> 01:45:24,466
Listen to me,
Gabriel is on the 695,

1347
01:45:24,466 --> 01:45:26,066
headed north, in a
haz-mat truck.

1348
01:45:26,066 --> 01:45:29,066
Wait, Gabriel has left Woodlawn?
We were heading there right now.

1349
01:45:29,066 --> 01:45:32,066
Bowman, he's got my daughter.

1350
01:45:33,266 --> 01:45:37,946
Listen, this haz-mat truck, it's a
government vehicle so it is tracked, right?

1351
01:45:37,946 --> 01:45:40,346
Track that down,
should take you right to him.

1352
01:45:40,346 --> 01:45:42,266
- Gimmie the tag number?
- Alright,

1353
01:45:42,266 --> 01:45:43,866
Here it comes.

1354
01:45:43,906 --> 01:45:46,626
Golf, Tango...

1355
01:45:47,106 --> 01:45:50,506
592, November.

1356
01:45:50,986 --> 01:45:53,866
Got it.
McClane, where is Farrell?

1357
01:45:53,866 --> 01:45:55,306
He is with them.

1358
01:45:56,746 --> 01:45:59,946
Listen to me, I'm gonna
go in there and get Lucy out.

1359
01:46:00,626 --> 01:46:02,546
But if something happens to me...

1360
01:46:02,546 --> 01:46:04,586
you gotta send in the cavalry,
do you hear me?

1361
01:46:04,586 --> 01:46:08,746
I mean everybody, don't let that
maniac get my daughter, you hear me?

1362
01:46:08,746 --> 01:46:10,266
John, don't worry.

1363
01:46:10,266 --> 01:46:12,506
I want your word, Bowman.

1364
01:46:14,146 --> 01:46:15,546
Yeah, you have it.

1365
01:46:16,746 --> 01:46:18,306
Why not?

1366
01:46:24,946 --> 01:46:26,666
There's the F-35.

1367
01:46:29,106 --> 01:46:31,026
Did you get the go codes?

1368
01:46:31,026 --> 01:46:33,946
- Trey! Did you get the go codes?
- Yes, I got the go codes.

1369
01:46:33,946 --> 01:46:36,146
Can you connect me to the pilot?

1370
01:46:52,106 --> 01:46:54,226
Isolating his radio.

1371
01:46:59,026 --> 01:47:01,746
Sending him the go codes.

1372
01:47:08,226 --> 01:47:09,386
AV-81.

1373
01:47:09,626 --> 01:47:12,946
AV-81, this is Marine Airway. ATC.

1374
01:47:13,026 --> 01:47:14,426
Gofer, AV-81.

1375
01:47:14,426 --> 01:47:18,626
Confirmed terrorist vehicle has been
located in your sector. Big-Rig Truck.

1376
01:47:19,306 --> 01:47:22,186
- We are in pursuit of a Haz-mat vehicle.
- I'm hearing you, ATC.

1377
01:47:22,186 --> 01:47:24,906
You are authorised to engage and destroy.

1378
01:47:25,106 --> 01:47:27,226
Copy that,
AV-81 engaging.

1379
01:47:35,706 --> 01:47:36,946
What...

1380
01:47:46,066 --> 01:47:47,466
God damn it!

1381
01:47:50,186 --> 01:47:52,226
You're shooting the wrong guy!

1382
01:47:59,386 --> 01:48:01,866
I don't think Daddy's
coming, honey.

1383
01:48:13,106 --> 01:48:16,546
Hey! Jackass!

1384
01:49:01,586 --> 01:49:03,146
Is that it?

1385
01:49:06,506 --> 01:49:08,386
Is that your best shot?

1386
01:51:47,706 --> 01:51:50,426
Come on, get out. That way.

1387
01:52:00,026 --> 01:52:02,946
We are leaving in 3 minutes.

1388
01:52:05,546 --> 01:52:07,906
You have 1.

1389
01:52:07,946 --> 01:52:12,546
The rules didn't change man, you're
gonna kill me as soon as I unlock it.

1390
01:52:15,666 --> 01:52:17,586
- Ah, shit!
- Matthew?

1391
01:52:17,586 --> 01:52:21,186
Matthew! I really need
you to pay attention.

1392
01:52:21,866 --> 01:52:24,346
The rules can always change.

1393
01:52:24,346 --> 01:52:27,066
- OK OK.
- I will shoot in her in 10 seconds.

1394
01:52:27,066 --> 01:52:29,986
- Wait, wait.
- Nine.

1395
01:52:30,146 --> 01:52:32,346
- I can't...
- Eight.

1396
01:52:33,066 --> 01:52:34,666
I can't...

1397
01:52:35,706 --> 01:52:37,026
Oh, God!

1398
01:52:39,826 --> 01:52:42,226
OK!

1399
01:52:42,706 --> 01:52:44,426
OK OK OK!

1400
01:52:44,626 --> 01:52:46,066
Six.

1401
01:52:46,226 --> 01:52:48,986
OK, stop stop,
I'm doing it.

1402
01:52:48,986 --> 01:52:50,786
I'm doing it. Oh, God!

1403
01:53:05,386 --> 01:53:07,746
The Feds are heading this way.

1404
01:53:07,826 --> 01:53:10,026
Get everything on the plane.

1405
01:53:17,946 --> 01:53:19,706
- Dad?
- Careful.

1406
01:53:20,386 --> 01:53:24,706
Don't worry baby,
Everything is going to be alright.

1407
01:53:26,226 --> 01:53:27,706
Daddy!

1408
01:53:34,906 --> 01:53:36,306
Hold this.

1409
01:54:01,306 --> 01:54:02,946
Jesus Christ!

1410
01:54:03,386 --> 01:54:05,226
You got her?

1411
01:54:05,746 --> 01:54:07,186
You sure?

1412
01:54:09,626 --> 01:54:11,546
Nice effort though.

1413
01:54:11,546 --> 01:54:12,986
Matthew?

1414
01:54:13,466 --> 01:54:15,426
Shit. OK.

1415
01:54:15,426 --> 01:54:17,146
I'm doing it,
I know.

1416
01:54:24,106 --> 01:54:25,546
McClane...

1417
01:54:26,426 --> 01:54:28,266
Would you do me
a favour?

1418
01:54:30,386 --> 01:54:32,786
I know the lights are
beginning to dim...

1419
01:54:32,786 --> 01:54:35,186
but if you can just hang
on for a second...

1420
01:54:35,186 --> 01:54:38,586
as soon as Matts finishes,
I'm gonna kill him and your daughter

1421
01:54:38,586 --> 01:54:41,586
And I would love for you
to see that.

1422
01:54:42,786 --> 01:54:44,586
God damn it. Mathew?

1423
01:54:44,786 --> 01:54:47,786
10 second,  OK 10 seconds
and you will have all your money.

1424
01:54:47,786 --> 01:54:49,626
You can just leave, nobody
has to get hurt, OK?

1425
01:54:49,626 --> 01:54:52,586
A few seconds. Stay
with me, McClane...

1426
01:54:54,026 --> 01:54:57,146
- Stay with me.
- Dad?

1427
01:54:57,546 --> 01:54:59,786
On your tombstone
it shall read:

1428
01:54:59,826 --> 01:55:02,906
"Always in the wrong place, at the wrong time"

1429
01:55:03,706 --> 01:55:07,626
How about:
"Yippi-kai-ay, mother fu..."

1430
01:55:20,966 --> 01:55:22,206
Daddy?

1431
01:55:22,726 --> 01:55:25,246
- Are you OK?
- Yeah, I'm fine...

1432
01:55:27,326 --> 01:55:29,726
I knew you would come for me.

1433
01:55:29,766 --> 01:55:33,446
Of course I would come for you.
It's OK.

1434
01:55:47,606 --> 01:55:48,846
Freeze!

1435
01:55:49,526 --> 01:55:52,246
Hold up, Hold up!
He's OK.

1436
01:55:57,806 --> 01:56:00,006
Help Daddy up.

1437
01:56:01,246 --> 01:56:03,206
I think I'll just stay
here for a minute.

1438
01:56:04,406 --> 01:56:06,446
Daddy, you are out of your mind.

1439
01:56:06,926 --> 01:56:09,126
- What are you talking about?
- You shot yourself.

1440
01:56:09,126 --> 01:56:11,566
It seemed like a good idea at the time.

1441
01:56:12,326 --> 01:56:15,846
Don't tell these guys
that I did that, OK?

1442
01:56:30,886 --> 01:56:32,446
Is he OK?

1443
01:56:33,846 --> 01:56:37,886
Lift your arms up,
Now put them down, further.

1444
01:56:38,766 --> 01:56:41,646
He might die from shock
on the way to the hospital.

1445
01:56:45,526 --> 01:56:46,966
Alright.

1446
01:56:49,406 --> 01:56:50,806
I'll be right back.

1447
01:56:53,246 --> 01:56:56,166
- Hey.
- How does it feel to be shot?

1448
01:56:56,166 --> 01:56:58,526
Actually it feels great. He gave me...

1449
01:56:58,526 --> 01:57:00,846
What's it called? Morfon...? Morphine.

1450
01:57:01,406 --> 01:57:06,286
- Well, you got your merit badge now?
- Yeah... I don't know what that means.

1451
01:57:06,286 --> 01:57:09,526
- Plus, you know, chicks dig scars.
- Really?

1452
01:57:11,606 --> 01:57:14,486
- Not that one.
- what?

1453
01:57:14,486 --> 01:57:17,406
- Don't even think about it.
- How did you know what I was thinking?

1454
01:57:17,406 --> 01:57:21,246
What, did she say something to you?
I felt, we had a vibe...

1455
01:57:21,246 --> 01:57:23,966
Take it easy, it's
just the morphine kicking in.

1456
01:57:25,006 --> 01:57:28,206
Besides, after all we've
been through,

1457
01:57:28,286 --> 01:57:31,446
I'd hate to have to
beat you to death.

1458
01:57:31,606 --> 01:57:33,286
That would suck.

1459
01:57:35,246 --> 01:57:37,246
- Good to go?
- Yes, all set.

1460
01:57:37,246 --> 01:57:40,366
Take care of yourself
I'll see you in the hospital.

1461
01:57:46,966 --> 01:57:49,966
Hey. Thanks for saving
my daughter's life.

1462
01:57:51,206 --> 01:57:53,886
What was I gonna do?

1463
01:57:55,046 --> 01:57:57,446
That's what makes
you "that" guy.

1464
01:57:59,886 --> 01:58:01,286
Yeah.

1465
01:58:08,216 --> 01:58:10,336
Did he say anything about me?

1466
01:58:11,896 --> 01:58:13,616
Jesus, Lucy!

1467
01:58:13,656 --> 01:58:16,736
what? I'm sorry,
I'm just asking.

1468
01:58:17,696 --> 01:58:20,936
I'm in enough pain already.
Hospital...

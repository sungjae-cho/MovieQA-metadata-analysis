1
00:00:32,857 --> 00:00:36,568
Okay, game point.
15-14. This team serves.

2
00:00:36,611 --> 00:00:40,447
Let's go. Service! Come on! Come on!

3
00:00:45,203 --> 00:00:48,706
Keep it up. Let's go.
Teamwork! Keep playing.

4
00:00:52,335 --> 00:00:56,463
Hit it to Carrie. She'll blow it.
Don't blow it, Carrie. Hit it.

5
00:00:57,841 --> 00:01:00,259
Carrie!
She blew it again.

6
00:01:00,343 --> 00:01:03,512
- We almost had the game.
- Play the game.

7
00:01:03,596 --> 00:01:05,723
We can't win a game
with her on the team.

8
00:01:05,765 --> 00:01:08,183
Look at her! Just standing there.

9
00:01:08,768 --> 00:01:10,769
You eat shit.

10
00:04:21,629 --> 00:04:22,795
Ow!

11
00:04:38,229 --> 00:04:40,897
- Help me! Help me!
- What are you doing?

12
00:04:40,981 --> 00:04:44,234
Help me! Help!

13
00:04:44,526 --> 00:04:46,778
Help me! Help me!

14
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:49,113
Have a Tampax.

15
00:04:49,156 --> 00:04:51,950
- Help me!
- Here you are, Carrie.

16
00:04:54,662 --> 00:04:56,746
Help me! Help me!

17
00:04:58,832 --> 00:05:00,166
Help me!

18
00:05:02,336 --> 00:05:04,629
Gross! Gross!

19
00:05:07,007 --> 00:05:11,344
Here. Plug it up. Plug it up! Plug it up!

20
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:15,265
- Plug it up!
- Plug it up!

21
00:05:16,684 --> 00:05:21,187
Plug it up! Plug it up!
Plug it up! Plug it up!

22
00:05:23,857 --> 00:05:26,859
What is going on here?
This isn't a pep rally.

23
00:05:26,944 --> 00:05:28,736
Plug it up!

24
00:05:29,196 --> 00:05:32,991
Plug it up! Plug it up! Plug it up!
Plug it up! Plug it up!

25
00:05:33,033 --> 00:05:38,037
- Sue, what are you doing?
- Carrie, she's just got her period.

26
00:05:38,122 --> 00:05:40,248
- Who's got her period?
- Carrie.

27
00:05:40,332 --> 00:05:42,083
What are you doing?

28
00:05:45,004 --> 00:05:47,714
Plug it up! Plug it up! Plug it up!

29
00:05:47,798 --> 00:05:50,425
Carrie. Carrie. Come on. Carrie.
Jesus, Carrie!

30
00:05:50,509 --> 00:05:52,385
Carrie, quit it. Jesus. Come on.

31
00:05:52,428 --> 00:05:56,180
Stop it! Now relax. Calm down.
Listen to me.

32
00:05:57,641 --> 00:06:01,436
It's okay. Just stand up and take care
of yourself. Come on. Come on.

33
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:05,690
Grow up. Stand up and take care
of yourself. Come on, do it. Do it.

34
00:06:09,278 --> 00:06:11,237
- Did you see that?
- No!

35
00:06:13,408 --> 00:06:16,160
Get out of here. Go on. Right now. Move!

36
00:06:21,124 --> 00:06:22,374
Carrie.

37
00:06:26,129 --> 00:06:31,091
Carrie, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I didn't know, okay? I'm sorry.

38
00:06:31,259 --> 00:06:34,762
Baby, come on, now.
Don't you know? Listen. Listen.

39
00:06:35,597 --> 00:06:39,725
I'm gonna talk to you about it. Okay.
Now just calm down. Just relax.

40
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:44,146
See? They're all gone. It's gonna be okay.

41
00:06:59,496 --> 00:07:03,207
- Isn't she a bit old for her...
- Her first period.

42
00:07:03,541 --> 00:07:04,917
Yes.

43
00:07:07,837 --> 00:07:12,633
Morty, until a half-hour ago, I don't even
think she knew there was such a thing.

44
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:17,429
That's really hard to believe

45
00:07:17,472 --> 00:07:21,225
in this day and age a girl in high school
wouldn't know something about

46
00:07:21,684 --> 00:07:24,228
- facts...
- Well, she didn't.

47
00:07:24,771 --> 00:07:26,271
But I don't know why
that should surprise us,

48
00:07:26,314 --> 00:07:28,690
I mean, knowing that mother of hers.

49
00:07:28,775 --> 00:07:31,777
Miss Collins, we can't interfere
with people's beliefs.

50
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:33,195
I know. I know.

51
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:35,906
- As for the girls...
- Carrie's always been their scapegoat.

52
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:38,450
- You'll have to do something.
- I will.

53
00:07:39,577 --> 00:07:44,456
But see, the thing is, Morty,
that I knew how they felt.

54
00:07:45,458 --> 00:07:49,336
See, the whole thing just made me
want to take her and shake her, too.

55
00:07:49,379 --> 00:07:50,504
You know what I mean?

56
00:07:50,588 --> 00:07:55,843
- It was just her period, for God's sake.
- Well, we'll send her home.

57
00:07:55,885 --> 00:07:59,847
- Miss Finch, send in Cassie Wright.
- It's Carrie White.

58
00:08:05,728 --> 00:08:07,813
- Come in, Cassie.
- Carrie.

59
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:12,192
Miss Finch,
would you bring in a dismissal slip?

60
00:08:13,445 --> 00:08:16,071
I thought you might take
the rest of the day and

61
00:08:16,156 --> 00:08:18,907
go home, take care of yourself, Cassie.

62
00:08:23,413 --> 00:08:26,248
We're all very sorry about this incident.

63
00:08:32,964 --> 00:08:34,381
It's Carrie.

64
00:08:38,011 --> 00:08:39,344
Thank you.

65
00:08:43,099 --> 00:08:46,560
Would you like to go to the infirmary?
Lie down for a while?

66
00:08:46,603 --> 00:08:48,729
I think Carrie can go home.

67
00:08:52,692 --> 00:08:56,570
Would you like a ride?
We could call you a cab.

68
00:08:56,654 --> 00:08:58,780
I'm sure she can walk home.

69
00:08:59,073 --> 00:09:01,283
And, Carrie, you're dismissed
from gym for a week.

70
00:09:01,367 --> 00:09:03,869
Just take study hall instead, okay?

71
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:09,875
- We're all sorry about this incident, Cassie.
- It's Carrie!

72
00:09:38,321 --> 00:09:40,572
Creepy Carrie! Creepy Carrie!

73
00:09:59,342 --> 00:10:02,010
Were you in Chicago
two years ago?

74
00:10:02,095 --> 00:10:03,304
Chicago?

75
00:10:03,389 --> 00:10:05,265
Yes, Bill. Chicago.

76
00:10:06,433 --> 00:10:08,851
Yes, I was living in Chicago.

77
00:10:09,645 --> 00:10:11,646
You knew that, didn't you?
I told you that, didn't I?

78
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:14,065
No, you didn't. I found out.

79
00:10:14,149 --> 00:10:16,651
You're looking at me
so strangely.

80
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,822
- Mrs. White.
- How have you been, Mrs. Snell?

81
00:10:21,031 --> 00:10:22,907
- Fine.
- And the doctor?

82
00:10:23,659 --> 00:10:24,659
Fine.

83
00:10:24,702 --> 00:10:28,079
- And your daughter?
- Sue is fine.

84
00:10:30,124 --> 00:10:33,501
- Won't you come in, Mrs. White?
- Oh, how kind of you.

85
00:10:38,799 --> 00:10:41,843
- I think Carrie is in some of Sue's classes.
- Yes.

86
00:10:41,927 --> 00:10:46,973
- Perhaps sometime she'd like to visit.
- I'm here on the Lord's work, Mrs. Snell.

87
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,519
Spreading the gospel of God's salvation
through Christ's blessing.

88
00:10:52,146 --> 00:10:54,230
- Yes, of course.
- I have something here,

89
00:10:54,315 --> 00:10:57,191
I know is gonna interest
the doctor and you.

90
00:10:57,276 --> 00:11:01,070
The Teenager's Path to Salvation
through the Cross of Jesus.

91
00:11:01,405 --> 00:11:04,032
I don't think Sue would be very interested.

92
00:11:04,074 --> 00:11:08,411
The children are wandering through the
wilderness of sin these days, Mrs. Snell.

93
00:11:08,495 --> 00:11:12,540
- My Sue is a good girl.
- These are godless times, Mrs. Snell.

94
00:11:12,625 --> 00:11:14,375
I'll drink to that.

95
00:11:15,544 --> 00:11:17,045
We'll all read these.

96
00:11:18,255 --> 00:11:20,923
Excuse me. Please sit down, Mrs. White.

97
00:11:23,385 --> 00:11:25,178
Hello?

98
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:29,057
Betty, can I call you back?
Margaret White is here.

99
00:11:29,975 --> 00:11:31,559
Are you accusing me?

100
00:11:31,602 --> 00:11:32,602
White.

101
00:11:32,686 --> 00:11:34,062
I can't believe this.

102
00:11:34,104 --> 00:11:35,980
Just let me get rid of her
and I'll call you right back.

103
00:11:42,655 --> 00:11:46,449
I have something here, Mrs. Snell,
that I think you might profit from.

104
00:11:46,533 --> 00:11:50,078
Mrs. White, I'd like to contribute five...

105
00:11:51,664 --> 00:11:53,081
$10.

106
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:56,417
I see.

107
00:12:11,934 --> 00:12:14,435
I pray you find Jesus.

108
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:24,112
Wasn't that Carrie White's mother?

109
00:12:24,196 --> 00:12:26,030
Hey, I didn't hear you come in.

110
00:12:26,615 --> 00:12:27,657
What'd she want?

111
00:13:10,701 --> 00:13:11,784
Yes?

112
00:13:14,913 --> 00:13:15,997
Yes.

113
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:35,016
Thank you.

114
00:13:41,857 --> 00:13:45,526
I know you're listening.
Come on downstairs.

115
00:14:03,213 --> 00:14:07,216
Mama? Who was that called?

116
00:14:17,227 --> 00:14:18,977
You're a woman now.

117
00:14:19,729 --> 00:14:21,980
Why didn't you tell me, Mama?

118
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:28,862
"And God made Eve from the rib ofAdam.

119
00:14:29,197 --> 00:14:32,449
"And Eve was weak
and loosed the raven on the world.

120
00:14:32,534 --> 00:14:35,828
"And the raven was called sin. " Say it.

121
00:14:35,912 --> 00:14:38,163
- The raven was called sin.
- Why didn't you tell me, Mama?

122
00:14:38,248 --> 00:14:39,873
- Say it.
- No.

123
00:14:39,916 --> 00:14:44,169
- The raven was called sin.
- And the raven was called sin!

124
00:14:44,754 --> 00:14:47,089
"And first sin was intercourse. "

125
00:14:47,715 --> 00:14:50,926
- First sin was intercourse.
- I didn't sin, Mama.

126
00:14:51,010 --> 00:14:53,428
- Say it!
- I didn't sin, Mama!

127
00:14:53,471 --> 00:14:54,638
The first sin was intercourse.

128
00:14:54,722 --> 00:14:56,723
First sin was intercourse.
First sin was intercourse.

129
00:14:56,766 --> 00:14:58,559
And the first sin was intercourse.

130
00:14:58,601 --> 00:15:01,270
Mama, I was so scared,
I thought I was dying.

131
00:15:01,312 --> 00:15:03,981
And the girls, they all laughed at me,
and threw things at me, Mama.

132
00:15:04,065 --> 00:15:06,066
- "And Eve was weak. " Say it.
- No, Mama!

133
00:15:06,109 --> 00:15:09,111
- Eve was weak.
- No!

134
00:15:09,153 --> 00:15:11,947
- Eve was weak. Say it, woman.
- No, Mama!

135
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:15,284
- Say it!
- Eve was weak. Eve was weak.

136
00:15:16,286 --> 00:15:21,123
"And the Lord visited Eve with a curse.
And the curse was the curse of blood. "

137
00:15:21,165 --> 00:15:25,627
You should have told me, Mama.
You should have told me.

138
00:15:26,045 --> 00:15:30,966
Lord, help this sinning woman
see the sin of her days and ways.

139
00:15:31,551 --> 00:15:34,094
Show her that if she had remained sinless

140
00:15:34,137 --> 00:15:36,722
the curse of blood
would never have come on her.

141
00:15:36,806 --> 00:15:38,432
She may have been tempted
by the Antichrist.

142
00:15:38,474 --> 00:15:41,018
She may have committed the sin
of lustful thoughts...

143
00:15:41,102 --> 00:15:43,312
- No, Mama! No!
- Don't lie, Carrietta.

144
00:15:43,396 --> 00:15:45,314
Don't you know by now,
I can see inside you?

145
00:15:45,398 --> 00:15:47,858
- I can see the sin as surely as God can.
- No, you don't, Mama.

146
00:15:47,942 --> 00:15:49,192
- You're hurting me.
- We'll pray.

147
00:15:49,277 --> 00:15:50,903
- We'll pray, woman.
- No!

148
00:15:50,987 --> 00:15:52,404
No!

149
00:15:52,488 --> 00:15:54,239
Pray to Jesus for our lustful, sinning souls.

150
00:15:55,408 --> 00:15:58,702
"God visited Eve with a curse.
And the curse was the curse of blood.

151
00:15:59,871 --> 00:16:04,458
"And he visited Eve with a second curse.
And this was the curse of childbearing.

152
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:07,252
"And Eve brought forth Cain
in sweat and blood. "

153
00:16:07,337 --> 00:16:09,004
Genesis 3:16.

154
00:16:09,088 --> 00:16:13,592
Mama! Let me out!
Mama, please let me out!

155
00:16:13,676 --> 00:16:18,347
Mama, please! Let me out! Mama! God!

156
00:16:36,324 --> 00:16:39,743
Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name...

157
00:17:04,477 --> 00:17:06,061
Thank you, Mama.

158
00:17:11,734 --> 00:17:13,652
You can go to bed now.

159
00:17:49,356 --> 00:17:52,608
There is power power
wonder-working power

160
00:17:52,651 --> 00:17:55,778
In the blood of the Lamb

161
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:13,129
Carrie?

162
00:18:18,469 --> 00:18:21,262
Carrie? Carrie?

163
00:18:22,097 --> 00:18:25,099
- Open the door.
- It's open, Mama.

164
00:18:35,778 --> 00:18:37,570
What was that noise?

165
00:18:39,073 --> 00:18:40,490
What noise?

166
00:18:44,578 --> 00:18:45,953
Go to bed.

167
00:18:46,413 --> 00:18:48,998
Yes, ma'am. Saying my prayers.

168
00:19:07,976 --> 00:19:09,352
"What are you
going to leave for us,

169
00:19:10,229 --> 00:19:15,983
"you people in your big cars,
spewing pollution into the air?

170
00:19:18,445 --> 00:19:24,075
"You people with heavy feet,
trampling down the wilderness?

171
00:19:25,452 --> 00:19:30,039
"You people who peer into
the back seats of our cars,

172
00:19:30,082 --> 00:19:34,919
"hours after you come out of
the back doors of your motels?

173
00:19:36,839 --> 00:19:41,425
"Soon all we will have is each other.

174
00:19:42,219 --> 00:19:44,303
"And that could be enough,

175
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:49,559
"if you will let us have
room enough and air enough

176
00:19:50,394 --> 00:19:54,730
"and peace enough to love each other,

177
00:19:55,816 --> 00:19:58,276
"as you never could. "

178
00:20:00,571 --> 00:20:03,489
I really must say, I must confess,

179
00:20:03,574 --> 00:20:07,577
this poem displays
the most extraordinary talent.

180
00:20:11,915 --> 00:20:15,668
A talent extraordinary for you,
Tommy Ross.

181
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:20,298
You know, Tommy,
this is slightly different

182
00:20:20,382 --> 00:20:23,467
from running touchdowns
and hitting home runs.

183
00:20:25,762 --> 00:20:29,098
Well, class, any criticisms?

184
00:20:34,438 --> 00:20:35,646
Anyone?

185
00:20:37,482 --> 00:20:39,066
It's beautiful.

186
00:20:43,822 --> 00:20:47,617
Carrie White! Beautiful.

187
00:20:48,702 --> 00:20:50,036
Beautiful.

188
00:20:51,663 --> 00:20:53,623
Beautiful!

189
00:20:55,959 --> 00:21:02,006
"O beautiful for spacious skies,
For amber waves of grain. "

190
00:21:02,174 --> 00:21:05,259
Is that the beautiful you mean?
Is it, Carrie?

191
00:21:06,678 --> 00:21:10,014
Well, I'm afraid, Carrie,
this is hardly a criticism.

192
00:21:10,182 --> 00:21:11,641
You suck.

193
00:21:13,101 --> 00:21:16,437
Tommy? Did you say something, Tommy?

194
00:21:16,772 --> 00:21:19,148
- Who, me?
- Yes, you.

195
00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:21,484
I said "Aw, shucks. "

196
00:21:30,661 --> 00:21:32,620
- Roll call. Blake.
- Present.

197
00:21:32,704 --> 00:21:33,913
- Bourne.
- Here.

198
00:21:33,997 --> 00:21:35,331
- Gogin.
- Present.

199
00:21:35,415 --> 00:21:36,667
- Grace.
- Here.

200
00:21:36,751 --> 00:21:38,335
- Hargensen.
- Here.

201
00:21:38,419 --> 00:21:39,670
- Litton.
- Yeah.

202
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:41,213
- McDermott.
- Present.

203
00:21:41,297 --> 00:21:42,965
- O'Shea.
- Present.

204
00:21:43,007 --> 00:21:44,424
- Pollock.
- Here.

205
00:21:44,509 --> 00:21:46,009
- Shires.
- Present.

206
00:21:46,094 --> 00:21:47,344
- Snell.
- Here.

207
00:21:47,428 --> 00:21:48,679
- Watson.
- Present.

208
00:21:48,763 --> 00:21:50,055
And the Wilsons.

209
00:21:51,015 --> 00:21:54,726
Okay, line up. Line up!

210
00:21:56,521 --> 00:21:57,980
Move it!

211
00:21:59,941 --> 00:22:03,277
On your feet, right now. Two lines.

212
00:22:05,655 --> 00:22:08,323
Alice and Mary, eyes front.

213
00:22:09,450 --> 00:22:10,701
Katie.

214
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:18,041
You too, Chris. And spit out that gum.

215
00:22:18,668 --> 00:22:21,712
- Where'll I put it, Miss Collins?
- You can choke on it for all I care.

216
00:22:21,796 --> 00:22:24,047
Just get it out of your mouth.

217
00:22:36,019 --> 00:22:38,645
Wipe that smirk off your face, Norma.

218
00:22:42,567 --> 00:22:46,236
Okay. Now, I want you all to know

219
00:22:46,321 --> 00:22:48,155
that you did
a really shitty thing yesterday.

220
00:22:48,239 --> 00:22:50,115
A really shitty thing.

221
00:22:54,454 --> 00:22:58,457
Did any of you ever stop to think
that Carrie White has feelings?

222
00:23:00,418 --> 00:23:02,836
Do any of you ever stop to think?

223
00:23:07,258 --> 00:23:12,262
No, I guess you're too busy
thinking about your dates and the prom.

224
00:23:15,683 --> 00:23:20,228
I guess you can take your pick, Chris.
Who's the lucky guy?

225
00:23:21,105 --> 00:23:22,814
- Billy Nolan.
- Who?

226
00:23:23,733 --> 00:23:26,276
- Billy Nolan.
- I'm sorry, could you speak up?

227
00:23:26,319 --> 00:23:27,778
Billy Nolan!

228
00:23:28,279 --> 00:23:30,447
Well, isn't he the lucky one.

229
00:23:37,288 --> 00:23:39,122
What about you, Sue?

230
00:23:40,124 --> 00:23:43,460
- Who's taking you?
- Tommy Ross.

231
00:23:44,921 --> 00:23:46,213
Right.

232
00:23:53,012 --> 00:23:56,807
Now, my idea
for this little trick you pulled

233
00:23:56,849 --> 00:24:01,269
was three days' suspension
and refusal of your prom tickets.

234
00:24:03,523 --> 00:24:04,648
What?

235
00:24:05,149 --> 00:24:06,233
God.

236
00:24:08,653 --> 00:24:12,697
That'd get you where you live, wouldn't it?
And you deserve it.

237
00:24:14,909 --> 00:24:20,455
I don't think any of you have any idea
of just how nasty what you did really was.

238
00:24:22,834 --> 00:24:27,587
But the office has decided
you're to have one week's detention.

239
00:24:33,219 --> 00:24:35,595
Still, there's one little catch.

240
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:38,181
It's to be my detention.

241
00:24:38,850 --> 00:24:45,188
That's 50 minutes every day,
starting today, on the athletic field.

242
00:24:46,149 --> 00:24:48,567
- Get the picture?
- I'm not coming.

243
00:24:54,532 --> 00:24:56,533
That's up to you, Chris.

244
00:24:57,910 --> 00:24:59,911
That's up to all of you.

245
00:25:01,456 --> 00:25:06,042
Punishment for skipping detention
is three days' suspension

246
00:25:06,669 --> 00:25:09,087
and refusal of your prom tickets.

247
00:25:11,716 --> 00:25:13,467
Any other thoughts?

248
00:25:15,511 --> 00:25:17,637
Good. Now change up.

249
00:25:20,558 --> 00:25:23,393
- Where are you going?
- I can't stay...

250
00:25:23,478 --> 00:25:25,562
- Come on.
- Aren't you going to come?

251
00:25:25,605 --> 00:25:28,566
- I'm not coming.
- You're really not gonna come?

252
00:25:28,650 --> 00:25:32,612
- I'm not coming.
- I'm not gonna miss the prom, Chris.

253
00:25:33,322 --> 00:25:34,322
Fuck!

254
00:25:34,406 --> 00:25:39,285
And, one, two, three, four.
Two, two, three, four.

255
00:25:39,369 --> 00:25:44,165
Three, two, three, four.
Four, two, three, four. Five, two...

256
00:25:44,249 --> 00:25:46,250
Energy, Norma! Come on. Come on.

257
00:25:46,335 --> 00:25:50,379
Eight, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.

258
00:25:50,422 --> 00:25:54,258
Two, two, three, four.
Three, two, three, four.

259
00:25:54,301 --> 00:25:58,387
Stretch, two, three, four.
Stretch, two, three, four.

260
00:25:58,430 --> 00:26:00,515
Stretch, Norma. Stretch.

261
00:26:00,599 --> 00:26:05,353
Stretch, two, three, four.
One, two, bend, up.

262
00:26:05,437 --> 00:26:09,482
Bend, up, one, two, one, two.

263
00:26:09,566 --> 00:26:11,609
One, two. Faster!

264
00:26:11,735 --> 00:26:16,030
And, one, two, one, two, one, two, one.

265
00:26:16,114 --> 00:26:23,037
And two and three and four

266
00:26:23,747 --> 00:26:29,001
and five and six

267
00:26:29,086 --> 00:26:34,298
and seven and eight

268
00:26:34,424 --> 00:26:39,011
and nine and ten

269
00:26:39,096 --> 00:26:42,932
and 11 and 12

270
00:26:42,975 --> 00:26:47,270
and 13 and 14 and 15.

271
00:27:22,139 --> 00:27:27,059
And, one, two, one, two, one, two,
one, two, one, two, one, two,

272
00:27:27,144 --> 00:27:28,603
one, two, one, two.

273
00:27:28,770 --> 00:27:33,024
Get your knees up.
One, two, one, two, one, two, one, two.

274
00:27:33,525 --> 00:27:37,737
- Come on, you hotshots.
- She can't get away with this.

275
00:27:38,196 --> 00:27:42,074
- I'm gonna get her.
- Let it go, Chris.

276
00:27:43,368 --> 00:27:45,411
Like hell I will.

277
00:27:46,038 --> 00:27:48,706
One, two, one, two, one, two.

278
00:27:50,167 --> 00:27:52,418
- The period's not up, Hargensen.
- It is for me.

279
00:27:52,502 --> 00:27:54,003
Keep running.

280
00:27:54,588 --> 00:27:58,341
- Well, there are ten minutes left.
- Stick them up your...

281
00:28:01,762 --> 00:28:05,389
You can't hit us.
You'll get canned for this, you bitch!

282
00:28:05,474 --> 00:28:07,642
One more word from you
and I'm gonna knock you down.

283
00:28:07,726 --> 00:28:09,226
Do you understand me?

284
00:28:09,311 --> 00:28:14,148
She can't get away with this
if we all stick together. Norma?

285
00:28:14,858 --> 00:28:16,067
Helen?

286
00:28:16,902 --> 00:28:20,988
- Sue?
- Shut up, Chris. Just shut up.

287
00:28:23,492 --> 00:28:27,411
This isn't over.
This isn't over by a long shot!

288
00:28:27,454 --> 00:28:29,914
You're out of the prom, Hargensen.

289
00:28:32,042 --> 00:28:34,085
Okay, the show's over.

290
00:28:34,127 --> 00:28:38,214
In place, run!
One, two, one, two, one, two.

291
00:28:59,277 --> 00:29:05,324
"Telekinesis.
Thought to be the ability to move

292
00:29:06,076 --> 00:29:10,579
"or to cause changes

293
00:29:10,622 --> 00:29:14,917
"in objects by force of the mind. "

294
00:29:37,233 --> 00:29:38,358
- Hey.
- Hi.

295
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:43,155
- Coach said I'm in the nationals.
- Are you kidding? Hey, terrific.

296
00:29:45,158 --> 00:29:48,994
- What's up?
- Can I talk to you?

297
00:29:49,036 --> 00:29:51,288
- Right now?
- It's real important.

298
00:29:53,499 --> 00:29:54,541
All right.

299
00:29:54,625 --> 00:29:58,003
- Tommy, if I asked you to do something...
- Yeah?

300
00:29:58,087 --> 00:30:01,965
...very special for me, would you do it?

301
00:30:02,633 --> 00:30:03,759
Yeah.

302
00:30:07,305 --> 00:30:09,639
I want you to take
Carrie White to the prom.

303
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:25,363
How's it looking there?

304
00:30:47,345 --> 00:30:48,720
Hey, Freddy!

305
00:30:48,805 --> 00:30:51,348
Want to go over to Minsky's
for some hard stuff?

306
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:58,605
No. Some other time.

307
00:30:58,898 --> 00:31:02,025
- You pussy!
- Give me one of them beers.

308
00:31:02,068 --> 00:31:04,152
- Suck on this.
- All right!

309
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:21,586
Hey, man!

310
00:31:30,805 --> 00:31:33,849
- Oh, shit.
- Watch it, you stupid shit.

311
00:31:45,444 --> 00:31:48,488
- Don't call me that.
- Well, look what you did.

312
00:31:52,577 --> 00:31:54,244
Stupid shit.

313
00:31:56,163 --> 00:31:57,956
- I told you not to call me that.
- Look out!

314
00:31:59,333 --> 00:32:00,709
Dumb punk!

315
00:32:01,669 --> 00:32:05,213
- What, are you scared?
- What, you want to get us killed?

316
00:32:08,801 --> 00:32:10,135
Dumb shit.

317
00:32:11,971 --> 00:32:13,263
You fuck!

318
00:32:48,674 --> 00:32:50,342
Okay, I'll do it.

319
00:33:14,117 --> 00:33:16,160
Don't be in such a hurry.

320
00:33:18,246 --> 00:33:19,872
Come on.

321
00:33:20,874 --> 00:33:22,959
"Don't be in such a hurry. "

322
00:33:23,043 --> 00:33:24,710
I'm hurrying away from you,
you know that?

323
00:33:24,753 --> 00:33:25,836
No, you're not.

324
00:33:25,879 --> 00:33:28,130
- Pain right in the ass.
- You don't mean that.

325
00:33:28,215 --> 00:33:29,882
I don't mean that.

326
00:33:33,804 --> 00:33:37,139
You're crazier than a son of a bitch,
you know that?

327
00:33:43,939 --> 00:33:45,272
Come here.

328
00:33:46,525 --> 00:33:47,817
Oh, shit.

329
00:34:04,793 --> 00:34:06,752
Jesus, what's wrong with you?

330
00:34:06,795 --> 00:34:11,090
- Can't you wait a minute?
- Well, what for? We do this all the time.

331
00:34:11,466 --> 00:34:13,259
You're so ignorant.

332
00:34:16,763 --> 00:34:20,307
Yeah, but that's what you
like about me, right? I know that.

333
00:34:20,392 --> 00:34:21,934
Bullshit.

334
00:34:22,019 --> 00:34:23,894
No? No?

335
00:34:25,272 --> 00:34:28,357
I know what you like about me.
This. Don't you?

336
00:34:28,859 --> 00:34:30,276
No!

337
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:35,239
Dumb shit.

338
00:34:36,116 --> 00:34:40,161
I thought I told you never to call me that.
You know, you are totally fucked up.

339
00:34:40,245 --> 00:34:45,291
That's it.
You really are, I know that. I'm convinced.

340
00:34:48,253 --> 00:34:49,462
Billy...

341
00:34:52,966 --> 00:34:54,341
Come here.

342
00:34:55,552 --> 00:34:57,553
Billy, come on.

343
00:35:02,642 --> 00:35:03,934
Come on.

344
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:12,276
I want you to do something.

345
00:35:12,652 --> 00:35:15,738
- What?
- Something important.

346
00:35:21,828 --> 00:35:22,995
Billy.

347
00:35:26,708 --> 00:35:31,337
Oh, Billy.

348
00:35:32,547 --> 00:35:36,050
Billy.

349
00:35:37,010 --> 00:35:40,554
Oh, Billy. Billy. Billy.

350
00:35:43,225 --> 00:35:45,851
Oh, Billy, I hate Carrie White.

351
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:48,020
Who?

352
00:36:14,214 --> 00:36:15,589
Hi, Carrie.

353
00:36:17,092 --> 00:36:18,092
Hi.

354
00:36:18,718 --> 00:36:21,262
- How are you?
- Okay.

355
00:36:21,555 --> 00:36:22,680
Good.

356
00:36:25,642 --> 00:36:27,226
What are you doing?

357
00:36:27,727 --> 00:36:28,978
Reading.

358
00:36:29,896 --> 00:36:31,981
Yeah? What are you reading?

359
00:36:33,316 --> 00:36:36,360
It's about sewing.

360
00:36:36,611 --> 00:36:38,404
Sewing. That's good.

361
00:36:41,366 --> 00:36:45,119
If you don't have a date for the prom next
Friday, would you like to go with me?

362
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:47,329
- What?
- To the prom.

363
00:36:47,414 --> 00:36:51,041
It's next Friday.
I know this is late notice, but...

364
00:36:51,418 --> 00:36:53,669
Carrie. Carrie, let...

365
00:36:59,259 --> 00:37:03,763
You guys go on. Practice those drills
from yesterday. I'll be right there.

366
00:37:14,483 --> 00:37:15,734
Carrie?

367
00:37:17,153 --> 00:37:18,403
Carrie.

368
00:37:20,781 --> 00:37:22,574
Hey, Carrie, what's the matter?

369
00:37:23,159 --> 00:37:25,285
- What happened?
- Nothing.

370
00:37:25,953 --> 00:37:27,954
Was it one of the girls?

371
00:37:28,581 --> 00:37:31,666
- Did one of the girls do something to you?
- No.

372
00:37:33,836 --> 00:37:37,422
Well, what is it, then?
You can trust me, you know that?

373
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:42,928
- Would you tell me?
- I got invited to the prom.

374
00:37:45,306 --> 00:37:47,682
That's great. That's fantastic.

375
00:37:47,767 --> 00:37:50,685
So what are you down here,
moping around for?

376
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:54,648
- Tommy Ross asked me.
- That's even better.

377
00:37:54,982 --> 00:37:59,069
- He's really cute.
- I know who he goes around with.

378
00:38:00,238 --> 00:38:03,156
They're just trying
to trick me again, I know.

379
00:38:03,199 --> 00:38:08,495
Maybe not.
I mean, maybe he really meant it.

380
00:38:09,288 --> 00:38:11,498
Hey, Carrie, let's think about this now.

381
00:38:11,582 --> 00:38:15,126
I mean, it might be terrific.
You might have a really good time.

382
00:38:15,294 --> 00:38:16,503
Carrie.

383
00:38:17,338 --> 00:38:19,172
Hey, Carrie, I want to talk to you.

384
00:38:19,215 --> 00:38:21,341
It's about this attitude
you have about yourself.

385
00:38:21,384 --> 00:38:25,720
I mean, you're always walking around
with your hair down, all moping around.

386
00:38:25,972 --> 00:38:27,222
Carrie.

387
00:38:28,099 --> 00:38:31,685
Come here, you big silly.
I want you to look at yourself.

388
00:38:35,398 --> 00:38:36,731
Would you look at that?

389
00:38:38,442 --> 00:38:39,693
Come on.

390
00:38:41,487 --> 00:38:45,073
Now, that's a pretty girl.
Look at your eyes.

391
00:38:45,866 --> 00:38:48,994
Little mascara to bring it out. A little.

392
00:38:49,203 --> 00:38:54,457
Your lips. Try some lipstick. You have
nice pretty lips. And your cheekbones.

393
00:38:55,251 --> 00:38:57,502
Look at your hair. It's beautiful hair.

394
00:38:57,545 --> 00:39:00,547
You could just put it up a little.
Maybe add a little curl.

395
00:39:00,631 --> 00:39:03,341
What do you think? Yeah.

396
00:39:05,219 --> 00:39:06,303
Well?

397
00:39:08,514 --> 00:39:12,517
- Well, what do you want to know?
- Why Tommy asked her to the prom.

398
00:39:14,562 --> 00:39:16,896
- Well?
- I asked him to.

399
00:39:18,649 --> 00:39:19,774
Why?

400
00:39:20,901 --> 00:39:22,277
What for?

401
00:39:24,363 --> 00:39:26,031
What could you possibly
have had in mind?

402
00:39:26,073 --> 00:39:28,950
I thought it would be good for Carrie

403
00:39:29,035 --> 00:39:32,412
to get her to join in with a few things,
and be with people...

404
00:39:32,455 --> 00:39:35,040
- Make her a part of things?
- Right.

405
00:39:35,708 --> 00:39:39,753
Come on, Sue. We're not that stupid.

406
00:39:40,796 --> 00:39:43,715
- Neither is Carrie.
- Maybe not. I don't know.

407
00:39:44,759 --> 00:39:46,301
You mean you're not gonna go?

408
00:39:46,385 --> 00:39:49,262
You're just gonna stay home
and miss your own senior prom?

409
00:39:50,348 --> 00:39:51,598
Come in.

410
00:39:52,391 --> 00:39:55,393
- What is it?
- Just the attendance sheets, Miss Collins.

411
00:39:55,436 --> 00:39:58,605
Thank you.
You know you can't go without a date.

412
00:40:02,651 --> 00:40:04,903
- Is there anything else, Norma?
- No, Miss Collins.

413
00:40:04,945 --> 00:40:06,613
Thank you, Norma.

414
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:14,496
- Which brings us to you.
- Miss Collins, I have to get to practice.

415
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:16,623
Well, it's too bad, isn't it?

416
00:40:16,791 --> 00:40:18,458
If you don't mind,
this is between Sue and I.

417
00:40:18,501 --> 00:40:20,126
But I do mind.

418
00:40:20,336 --> 00:40:21,795
Unless, of course, you'd like to continue

419
00:40:21,837 --> 00:40:25,048
this little discussion
in Mr. Morton's office.

420
00:40:25,299 --> 00:40:27,634
What is the big deal?

421
00:40:27,718 --> 00:40:31,679
Because it is a very big deal
for Carrie White, and you know it.

422
00:40:32,390 --> 00:40:36,476
- She already said no, anyway.
- With a little effort you can change that.

423
00:40:36,519 --> 00:40:39,396
- Don't count your chickens.
- Just don't try.

424
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:43,191
- Fine. I won't try.
- Wait a second. It's not fine.

425
00:40:44,944 --> 00:40:47,737
You can't order someone
not to take someone to the prom.

426
00:40:47,822 --> 00:40:51,283
You know, I can make sure that
you don't hurt Carrie White anymore.

427
00:40:51,326 --> 00:40:55,037
We're not trying to hurt her, Miss Collins.
We're trying to help her.

428
00:40:55,122 --> 00:40:56,497
How?

429
00:41:03,505 --> 00:41:08,050
Hey, Tommy, don't you think
you're just gonna look a little ridiculous

430
00:41:08,135 --> 00:41:10,261
when you walk in with Carrie White?

431
00:41:10,345 --> 00:41:12,346
We don't care how we look.

432
00:41:14,057 --> 00:41:15,850
Do we?

433
00:41:21,356 --> 00:41:22,481
What?

434
00:42:19,748 --> 00:42:21,540
- Hi, Carrie.
- Hi.

435
00:42:22,834 --> 00:42:26,253
- So this is where you live.
- What are you doing here?

436
00:42:26,630 --> 00:42:28,422
You gonna ask me in?

437
00:42:29,132 --> 00:42:30,424
Why not?

438
00:42:34,262 --> 00:42:35,763
Mama's resting.

439
00:42:36,431 --> 00:42:40,267
- What do you want?
- God, right to the point, huh?

440
00:42:42,354 --> 00:42:44,063
- About the prom again.
- I already told you.

441
00:42:44,105 --> 00:42:46,357
I know, but there's nothing
to say you can't change your mind.

442
00:42:46,441 --> 00:42:48,776
- Girls do it all the time.
- Why are you doing this?

443
00:42:49,110 --> 00:42:50,945
- 'Cause I want to.
- No, you're not.

444
00:42:50,987 --> 00:42:52,780
Carrie, now come on,
I don't do anything I don't want to.

445
00:42:52,822 --> 00:42:55,115
- I can't.
- Yes, you can.

446
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:56,408
Carrie?

447
00:42:56,952 --> 00:42:59,453
- You better go.
- Not till you say yes.

448
00:42:59,496 --> 00:43:02,581
- No. I can't.
- Yes, you can.

449
00:43:02,916 --> 00:43:04,416
I said I can't.

450
00:43:04,459 --> 00:43:05,709
Carrie?

451
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:08,462
Yes, you can.

452
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:11,924
- Will you please go?
- Not till you say yes.

453
00:43:12,342 --> 00:43:14,635
Why is it so important to you?

454
00:43:16,513 --> 00:43:19,974
I don't know.
Maybe because you liked my poem.

455
00:43:20,475 --> 00:43:21,684
Carrie.

456
00:43:25,605 --> 00:43:29,316
- Okay, okay, I'll go.
- Good. I'll pick you up at 8:00.

457
00:43:31,486 --> 00:43:32,653
Okay.

458
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:40,619
What's the matter, Willie?
We gonna wake up the little piggies?

459
00:43:41,830 --> 00:43:45,457
You know, this is a hell of a risk for a joke.

460
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:48,502
- You want out?
- No, no. It's a good joke.

461
00:43:48,587 --> 00:43:51,463
- You bet it's a good joke.
- It's a good joke.

462
00:43:51,506 --> 00:43:52,673
Look at this.

463
00:43:53,174 --> 00:43:55,301
- What?
- All these pigs.

464
00:43:55,927 --> 00:43:59,179
- What are you talking about?
- These painted pigs.

465
00:43:59,639 --> 00:44:03,225
Stupid Old Man Henty's nitwit
cousin painted them all over the place.

466
00:44:03,310 --> 00:44:06,186
I know, I went out with the girl
that posed for them.

467
00:44:06,271 --> 00:44:07,605
She was a real pig!

468
00:44:07,689 --> 00:44:10,524
Will you shut up?
- Will you let me up here, man?

469
00:44:11,026 --> 00:44:13,360
I'm gonna kill that pig, right?

470
00:44:15,155 --> 00:44:19,033
Piggy! Here, piggy!

471
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:22,077
I'm gonna bash your little heads in,

472
00:44:22,162 --> 00:44:25,456
and you don't have to worry
about the bomb no more.

473
00:44:25,540 --> 00:44:27,875
Come here, little piggies.
Come here, sucker.

474
00:44:27,917 --> 00:44:29,918
Come here, you little sucker. Come here.

475
00:44:30,003 --> 00:44:31,587
Here's the one, right here.
Come here.

476
00:44:31,671 --> 00:44:34,840
- Will you shut up and do it already?
- We gotta give them a chance.

477
00:44:34,883 --> 00:44:36,425
- Come here, you sucker. Come here.
- Oh, yeah?

478
00:44:36,509 --> 00:44:40,554
You can't do it from standing out here.
Get her done, man, get her done.

479
00:44:40,639 --> 00:44:45,143
- I can't. I can't. You.
- Oh, I knew it. I knew this would happen.

480
00:44:45,728 --> 00:44:48,063
Hold it there, you pig. You fuck-up.

481
00:44:48,105 --> 00:44:49,564
- Do it, Billy.
- You know it. You're just a fuck-up.

482
00:44:49,649 --> 00:44:51,232
- And you shut up.
- Just do it!

483
00:44:51,275 --> 00:44:55,403
All right, move it out, move it out!
That's it. That's it. Come on. Come on.

484
00:44:55,488 --> 00:44:59,908
Move it out.
Yeah, that's my baby. Yeah. Yeah.

485
00:45:00,242 --> 00:45:03,119
Do it! Do it! Do it!

486
00:45:17,259 --> 00:45:20,136
Carrie, you haven't touched
your apple cake.

487
00:45:20,221 --> 00:45:22,347
Gives me pimples, Mama.

488
00:45:22,431 --> 00:45:25,392
Pimples are the Lord's way
of chastising you.

489
00:45:26,769 --> 00:45:28,269
- Mama?
- Yeah?

490
00:45:28,896 --> 00:45:33,566
Mama, please see that I've gotta start
to try and get along with people better.

491
00:45:33,609 --> 00:45:36,152
What are you going on about, Carrie?

492
00:45:37,113 --> 00:45:39,406
I've been invited to the prom.

493
00:45:41,450 --> 00:45:42,617
Prom?

494
00:45:43,202 --> 00:45:47,247
Yeah, the senior prom, you know.
Everybody's going.

495
00:45:47,289 --> 00:45:50,458
It's that teacher that called, wasn't it?

496
00:45:50,501 --> 00:45:53,795
Please see that I'm not like you, Mama.
I'm funny.

497
00:45:53,838 --> 00:45:57,173
I mean, all the kids think I'm funny.
I don't want to be. I want to be normal.

498
00:45:57,258 --> 00:45:59,801
I want to start to try
and be a whole person

499
00:45:59,844 --> 00:46:01,845
before it's too late for me to...

500
00:46:04,306 --> 00:46:06,850
His name is Tommy Ross
and he's a very nice boy, Mama.

501
00:46:06,934 --> 00:46:08,560
- No.
- And he promised to stop in

502
00:46:08,644 --> 00:46:10,478
- and meet you.
- I said no.

503
00:46:10,646 --> 00:46:12,147
- Mama, I've accepted!
- No. No.

504
00:46:12,231 --> 00:46:14,274
- No. No.
- I've accepted, Mama!

505
00:46:14,316 --> 00:46:16,234
- I accepted.
- Come to your closet.

506
00:46:16,318 --> 00:46:17,777
No.

507
00:46:17,820 --> 00:46:20,989
- After all you've been taught.
- Everyone isn't bad, Mama.

508
00:46:21,031 --> 00:46:24,159
- Everything isn't a sin.
- Come to your closet and pray.

509
00:46:24,243 --> 00:46:25,994
Ask to be forgiven.

510
00:46:26,495 --> 00:46:30,540
He's a nice boy, Mama. You'd like him.
You'd really like him, Mama.

511
00:46:30,916 --> 00:46:32,417
Boys.

512
00:46:34,795 --> 00:46:38,590
The boys. The boys. Yes, the boys.

513
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:43,678
After the blood come the boys,
like sniffing dogs,

514
00:46:43,721 --> 00:46:47,682
grinning and slobbering and trying
to find out where that smell comes from.

515
00:46:47,725 --> 00:46:50,018
Where the smell is. That smell.

516
00:46:50,352 --> 00:46:53,855
Listen, I know where they take them
'cause I've seen it, all right.

517
00:46:53,898 --> 00:46:57,150
- Well, you're not going.
- I already said I would.

518
00:46:57,193 --> 00:47:00,862
Tell that boy you're not going,
or we're gonna move from here.

519
00:47:00,905 --> 00:47:02,030
No.

520
00:47:02,198 --> 00:47:05,700
We'll move and you'll never see
that boy again. The rain's coming in.

521
00:47:05,785 --> 00:47:08,203
- Mama, please sit and talk to me.
- I'm gonna close the window.

522
00:47:08,245 --> 00:47:12,040
Mama, please sit and talk to me!

523
00:47:22,218 --> 00:47:23,843
I'm going, Mama.

524
00:47:25,846 --> 00:47:28,598
And things are gonna change around here.

525
00:47:29,892 --> 00:47:34,479
Witch. You've got Satan's power.

526
00:47:35,397 --> 00:47:40,235
It's nothing to do with Satan, Mama.
It's me. Me.

527
00:47:40,319 --> 00:47:43,488
If I concentrate hard enough,
I can move things.

528
00:47:43,572 --> 00:47:48,993
- Satan is clever.
- No, Mama. I'm not the only one.

529
00:47:50,079 --> 00:47:52,872
Other people can do it. I read about it.

530
00:47:53,916 --> 00:47:56,334
You poor child. Don't you know?

531
00:47:56,418 --> 00:47:59,087
He doesn't let you know
he's working through you.

532
00:47:59,129 --> 00:48:01,840
Mama, I'd know.

533
00:48:01,924 --> 00:48:04,759
He entered your father and carried him off.

534
00:48:06,262 --> 00:48:09,097
- He ran away, Mama.
- The devil tempted him.

535
00:48:09,765 --> 00:48:13,935
He ran away with a woman, Mama.
Everybody knows that.

536
00:48:13,978 --> 00:48:15,436
You must renounce this power.

537
00:48:15,521 --> 00:48:18,398
You must give it up.
You must never use it.

538
00:48:20,442 --> 00:48:22,026
I'm going, Mama.

539
00:48:23,737 --> 00:48:25,154
You can't stop me

540
00:48:26,740 --> 00:48:28,366
and I don't want to talk about it anymore.

541
00:48:45,260 --> 00:48:47,136
Will you keep
that damn light straight?

542
00:48:47,178 --> 00:48:48,304
Hurry up.

543
00:48:49,139 --> 00:48:53,309
Watch it, you stupid shit.
You're getting blood all over the place.

544
00:48:54,853 --> 00:48:56,979
Who you calling a stupid shit?

545
00:48:57,022 --> 00:48:59,481
I mean, you can't even keep
that fucking light straight.

546
00:48:59,524 --> 00:49:01,025
Just hurry up.

547
00:49:02,152 --> 00:49:06,405
Yes, ma'am. We's doing the best we can.
We really are, boss.

548
00:49:06,823 --> 00:49:09,199
Hurry up. I want to go home.

549
00:49:13,705 --> 00:49:16,624
Just keep your tits on

550
00:49:16,666 --> 00:49:20,002
and I'll let you pull the rope
when the time comes.

551
00:49:20,629 --> 00:49:23,756
- I plan to.
- I know.

552
00:49:42,651 --> 00:49:44,985
Ernest. Listen, tonight's prom night

553
00:49:45,028 --> 00:49:46,403
- and everything, right?
- Hi, Freddy.

554
00:49:46,488 --> 00:49:48,364
I didn't know you were interested in going.

555
00:49:48,448 --> 00:49:50,950
I'm not interested in going.
I'm a student here, aren't I?

556
00:49:51,034 --> 00:49:52,952
- I don't know. Are you?
- Sure I am.

557
00:49:53,036 --> 00:49:56,080
I got so much spirit in this school,
I want to be on the committee.

558
00:49:56,164 --> 00:49:57,289
You're a little late, Freddy.

559
00:49:57,374 --> 00:49:59,291
I could have used you a week ago
on the decorating committee.

560
00:49:59,376 --> 00:50:03,212
No, I'm not late, Ernest.
I'm right on time, pal.

561
00:50:03,254 --> 00:50:04,797
I want to collect the ballots, you know.

562
00:50:04,881 --> 00:50:08,092
For the king and queen and the voting,
and, you know.

563
00:50:08,176 --> 00:50:12,554
- Think we can arrange that?
- Okay. Can you be here 6:30?

564
00:50:12,639 --> 00:50:15,849
No. No, I can't be here at 6:30.

565
00:50:15,892 --> 00:50:18,727
I'll be here at 8:00. How's 8:00?
8:00's fine with me.

566
00:50:18,812 --> 00:50:20,896
- Yeah, that'll do. Okay.
- Okay. Well, we'll see you then.

567
00:50:20,939 --> 00:50:23,774
- Yeah. See you, Freddy. Take it easy.
- I'll take it any way I can get it, pal.

568
00:50:24,401 --> 00:50:28,487
Hey, Helen. Helen? Helen!

569
00:50:28,571 --> 00:50:34,326
- What?
- Did you hear about Tommy Ross?

570
00:50:34,411 --> 00:50:37,371
- What?
- He's taking Carrie White to the prom.

571
00:50:37,831 --> 00:50:39,581
- No!
- Yeah.

572
00:50:43,294 --> 00:50:46,338
- He can't do that. Where's Sue?
- Yes, he can. He asked her.

573
00:50:46,423 --> 00:50:48,590
- What's she gonna wear?
- Who, Carrie?

574
00:50:48,675 --> 00:50:50,092
A sackcloth?

575
00:50:52,095 --> 00:50:54,596
Freida, you gotta keep
those stars coming faster.

576
00:50:54,681 --> 00:50:56,056
They're coming.

577
00:50:56,099 --> 00:50:59,727
What's this I hear
about Tommy taking Carrie to the prom?

578
00:51:00,145 --> 00:51:02,396
Whatever you heard, it's true.

579
00:51:03,398 --> 00:51:06,442
Why's he doing it?
Everybody is talking about it.

580
00:51:06,484 --> 00:51:09,695
I asked him to
'cause I thought I owed it to Carrie.

581
00:51:09,779 --> 00:51:11,655
And where's that put everybody else?

582
00:51:11,740 --> 00:51:13,282
They gotta deal with it in their own way.

583
00:51:13,366 --> 00:51:16,118
- What do you mean?
- Just something.

584
00:51:16,161 --> 00:51:19,747
- Well, you're not going to the prom.
- Oh, I'll be here.

585
00:51:19,789 --> 00:51:21,165
- You'll be here?
- I sure will.

586
00:51:21,249 --> 00:51:22,458
What do you mean?
You're going to the prom?

587
00:51:22,542 --> 00:51:24,126
Shut up. I will tell you later.

588
00:51:24,169 --> 00:51:25,753
You're gonna be in on it.
Don't worry about it.

589
00:51:25,795 --> 00:51:27,463
I'm gonna be in on it? What?

590
00:51:27,505 --> 00:51:30,215
- Come on. Tell me.
- I'll tell you later.

591
00:51:30,300 --> 00:51:33,469
- I want to know now, Chris.
- Just wait.

592
00:51:33,553 --> 00:51:36,930
Can't you give me a hint?
I won't tell anybody, I promise.

593
00:51:36,973 --> 00:51:40,142
I won't say a word. I promise.
I'm your best friend.

594
00:51:40,226 --> 00:51:42,227
- Come on.
- Okay.

595
00:52:15,845 --> 00:52:18,555
Look, you gotta rent yourself
a tuxedo for the prom.

596
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:20,224
I know. I only got ten bucks, though.

597
00:52:20,308 --> 00:52:23,894
Ten bucks, you can rent yourself a tuxedo.
You don't have to look great.

598
00:52:24,980 --> 00:52:27,023
- Does this look nice?
- He looks beautiful.

599
00:52:27,066 --> 00:52:29,734
You'll make a good impression
for once in your life.

600
00:52:29,819 --> 00:52:31,861
- Would you go out with me?
- Not with ruffles.

601
00:52:31,904 --> 00:52:33,905
All right, you don't have
to get ruffles for yourself.

602
00:52:33,989 --> 00:52:35,532
You always gotta make a joke, right?

603
00:52:35,616 --> 00:52:37,033
No, I just don't like ruffles.

604
00:52:37,076 --> 00:52:38,701
You don't like...
You don't have to get ruffles!

605
00:52:38,786 --> 00:52:40,620
All right, now look at me, Beak.
Don't I look sharp?

606
00:52:40,704 --> 00:52:44,415
Yeah, it looks good on you,
but I don't look right in a tuxedo.

607
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:45,667
How do you know?
Have you ever put on a tuxedo?

608
00:52:45,709 --> 00:52:47,836
I don't have a tuxedo body.

609
00:52:50,589 --> 00:52:54,592
- I know, they have tuxedos here for you.
- I wouldn't look right.

610
00:52:54,677 --> 00:52:57,178
Wait a second,
I know just the tuxedo for him.

611
00:52:57,221 --> 00:52:59,722
Well, what do you think, huh?

612
00:53:00,724 --> 00:53:04,394
- I like it. I think it's terrific.
- Look at that. No ruffles at all.

613
00:53:14,405 --> 00:53:17,365
Red. I might've known it would be red.

614
00:53:18,868 --> 00:53:20,493
It's pink, Mama.

615
00:53:22,621 --> 00:53:25,915
Look what Tommy gave me, Mama.
Aren't they beautiful?

616
00:53:32,214 --> 00:53:36,467
I can see your dirty pillows. Everyone will.

617
00:53:38,262 --> 00:53:43,725
Breasts, Mama. They're called breasts.
And every woman has them.

618
00:53:48,606 --> 00:53:50,440
Take off that dress.

619
00:53:51,233 --> 00:53:54,194
- No.
- We'll burn it and pray for forgiveness.

620
00:53:54,528 --> 00:53:56,112
No, Mama.

621
00:54:09,460 --> 00:54:10,752
Well, he's not coming.

622
00:54:10,794 --> 00:54:14,380
He is coming, Mama. Now stop it.
I'm nervous enough.

623
00:54:20,095 --> 00:54:21,888
No, he's not coming.

624
00:54:23,891 --> 00:54:25,683
He's not gonna come.

625
00:54:31,148 --> 00:54:32,482
Go away.

626
00:54:34,610 --> 00:54:36,444
Stop it, Mama.

627
00:54:36,487 --> 00:54:39,322
- Stop hurting yourself, Mama.
- I'm not.

628
00:54:39,990 --> 00:54:42,951
He's gonna laugh at you.
They're all gonna laugh at you.

629
00:54:42,993 --> 00:54:45,078
- No, they're not gonna laugh at me.
- It's not too late.

630
00:54:45,162 --> 00:54:46,329
You can stay here with me.

631
00:54:46,372 --> 00:54:48,331
I don't want to stay with you, Mama.

632
00:54:48,374 --> 00:54:51,084
Look, I'll answer the door
and I'll tell him you're sick.

633
00:54:51,168 --> 00:54:53,336
- I'll tell him you changed your mind.
- Be quiet.

634
00:54:53,420 --> 00:54:55,380
Sit down! Be quiet!

635
00:55:07,726 --> 00:55:08,726
All right. Look,

636
00:55:08,811 --> 00:55:12,230
- I'll tell him that you changed your mind.
- Sit down!

637
00:55:12,982 --> 00:55:17,360
Just sit there, Mama,
and don't say a word until I'm gone.

638
00:55:20,030 --> 00:55:21,823
I'll be home early.

639
00:55:24,952 --> 00:55:26,577
I love you, Mama.

640
00:55:29,581 --> 00:55:32,125
"Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live. "

641
00:55:57,818 --> 00:56:02,572
Tommy, could we wait here just a minute?

642
00:56:12,583 --> 00:56:14,125
Are you scared?

643
00:56:21,301 --> 00:56:23,344
Maybe this was a mistake.

644
00:56:23,720 --> 00:56:27,056
Oh, no. It's not gonna be that bad.

645
00:56:28,141 --> 00:56:30,392
They're a good crowd. Really.

646
00:56:31,770 --> 00:56:33,020
Really.

647
00:56:34,022 --> 00:56:35,814
Don't be so nervous.

648
00:56:36,900 --> 00:56:40,402
Besides, I'd look awfully stupid
dancing by myself, wouldn't I?

649
00:56:40,445 --> 00:56:41,904
Now come on.

650
00:56:51,373 --> 00:56:54,291
As I look back upon my younger days

651
00:56:54,376 --> 00:56:56,752
I really was a maniac

652
00:56:57,295 --> 00:57:02,216
Blowin' up a john with a cherry bomb
Gave the janitor a cardiac

653
00:57:03,009 --> 00:57:06,303
Well, the teachers would say
they should lock him away

654
00:57:06,346 --> 00:57:09,306
And throw away all of the keys
Please

655
00:57:09,349 --> 00:57:13,811
He's outta control
The devil's got a hold of his soul

656
00:57:15,230 --> 00:57:18,148
Many were the times
that my buddies and I

657
00:57:18,233 --> 00:57:20,734
Choked upon a cigarette

658
00:57:20,819 --> 00:57:23,862
Gettin' too drunk to talk
and we could barely walk

659
00:57:23,947 --> 00:57:25,948
Swearin' for the hell of it

660
00:57:27,117 --> 00:57:30,160
Then we'd hitch a ride
to see the president's daughter

661
00:57:30,203 --> 00:57:33,122
Her parties were so outta sight
Right

662
00:57:33,164 --> 00:57:37,418
Dancin' till dawn while her parents
were clean outta town

663
00:57:38,920 --> 00:57:41,505
High school, preschool

664
00:57:41,589 --> 00:57:45,050
Now twelve long years
of the education blues

665
00:57:45,135 --> 00:57:47,511
Teachers, preachers

666
00:57:47,595 --> 00:57:52,099
Now I don't know how
I ever made it through

667
00:58:09,242 --> 00:58:11,243
Boy, you know, Ross,
if I knew you'd look this sharp,

668
00:58:11,327 --> 00:58:13,537
I would have taken you
instead of whatshername.

669
00:58:13,580 --> 00:58:17,791
Don't bother about them.
If they self-destruct, I'll dance with you.

670
00:58:20,378 --> 00:58:24,214
Hey, where did you buy that dress?
I love it.

671
00:58:24,257 --> 00:58:26,675
- I made it.
- Made it?

672
00:58:27,302 --> 00:58:30,804
- The decorations, don't they look great?
- Yeah.

673
00:58:30,889 --> 00:58:32,639
I'm so nervous.

674
00:58:32,724 --> 00:58:35,184
It's okay. You can sit with us.

675
00:58:35,226 --> 00:58:37,853
- Hey, what time is it?
- 8:00.

676
00:58:39,272 --> 00:58:40,814
- Where are you going?
- Just out.

677
00:58:40,899 --> 00:58:42,065
What?

678
00:58:42,859 --> 00:58:45,235
- See you later.
- Sue!

679
00:58:57,081 --> 00:58:59,082
Would you like to dance?

680
00:58:59,167 --> 00:59:01,335
Could we just sit here for a minute?

681
00:59:01,419 --> 00:59:04,296
Oh, sure. Sure, anything you want.

682
00:59:11,429 --> 00:59:14,806
- Carrie.
- Hi, Miss Collins.

683
00:59:15,433 --> 00:59:18,936
- You look so pretty.
- You too. You look beautiful.

684
00:59:19,646 --> 00:59:23,607
Thank you. I know I don't, not really,
but thank you anyway.

685
00:59:23,942 --> 00:59:26,235
- May I sit down?
- Grab a chair.

686
00:59:26,277 --> 00:59:27,611
Thank you.

687
00:59:29,781 --> 00:59:32,449
I'm gonna go and talk to some people.

688
00:59:52,136 --> 00:59:53,929
I remember my prom.

689
00:59:53,972 --> 00:59:58,058
I had a date with
the captain of the basketball team.

690
00:59:58,142 --> 01:00:00,936
And he was 6'7" tall,

691
01:00:00,979 --> 01:00:04,398
so I went out and bought a pair
of three-inch spike heels

692
01:00:04,482 --> 01:00:08,820
so our kiss goodnight would be
less awkward.

693
01:00:08,988 --> 01:00:11,656
So anyway, we went in his pick-up truck,

694
01:00:11,740 --> 01:00:13,157
which, of course, broke down,

695
01:00:13,242 --> 01:00:16,828
and we had to get out
and walk the last half-mile to the prom.

696
01:00:16,870 --> 01:00:18,079
So, by the time I got there,

697
01:00:18,163 --> 01:00:21,749
my feet were so covered with blisters
that all I could do was sit there.

698
01:00:21,834 --> 01:00:27,046
I mean, I couldn't dance.
So we just sat there and just talked.

699
01:00:28,007 --> 01:00:32,844
And it was magic. Is it like that for you?

700
01:00:33,721 --> 01:00:35,305
It's...

701
01:00:37,266 --> 01:00:39,767
- It's nice.
- Just nice?

702
01:00:39,852 --> 01:00:41,936
No. It's...

703
01:00:42,646 --> 01:00:44,480
It's like...

704
01:00:45,983 --> 01:00:50,194
- It's like being on Mars.
- You'll never forget it.

705
01:00:50,821 --> 01:00:52,655
I don't think I will.

706
01:00:54,950 --> 01:00:56,326
Thank you.

707
01:00:57,036 --> 01:01:01,372
Hey, what's going on here?
What are you doing with my date?

708
01:01:01,415 --> 01:01:03,708
- Well, we were just talking, you know.
- Yeah?

709
01:01:04,877 --> 01:01:06,878
Have a lovely time, okay?

710
01:01:07,046 --> 01:01:08,421
And you too.

711
01:01:09,965 --> 01:01:11,049
Bye.

712
01:01:14,637 --> 01:01:17,805
Don't let me catch you
hugging any guys like that.

713
01:01:17,890 --> 01:01:20,642
- I won't.
- Better not.

714
01:01:21,101 --> 01:01:22,352
I won't.

715
01:01:30,194 --> 01:01:32,904
Do you really have to be home so early?

716
01:01:33,280 --> 01:01:34,906
Yeah, I promised.

717
01:01:35,991 --> 01:01:37,116
Okay.

718
01:01:38,786 --> 01:01:41,371
- Sorry.
- That's all right.

719
01:01:43,957 --> 01:01:47,251
Some of the kids are going to go over
to Lewiston's after the prom.

720
01:01:47,336 --> 01:01:49,545
- That's okay.
- What?

721
01:01:50,839 --> 01:01:54,217
If you want to go with your friends,
I don't want to spoil anything.

722
01:01:54,259 --> 01:01:57,470
Would you let me finish?
What I was gonna say

723
01:01:57,554 --> 01:02:02,558
is that, if you'd like to, we could stop in
at the Beehive for a couple of minutes.

724
01:02:03,852 --> 01:02:06,062
- I've never been there.
- No?

725
01:02:06,230 --> 01:02:08,314
Good. Well, then, let's go.

726
01:02:08,941 --> 01:02:10,733
- Okay.
- Okay? For sure.

727
01:02:11,777 --> 01:02:13,152
All right.

728
01:02:16,782 --> 01:02:18,658
Are you ready to dance?

729
01:02:19,326 --> 01:02:20,618
Come on.

730
01:02:21,412 --> 01:02:24,038
- I can't. I don't know how.
- Come on.

731
01:02:24,456 --> 01:02:26,958
- I can't, Tommy. I can't.
- Come on. Sure you can.

732
01:02:32,047 --> 01:02:33,631
I'm not sure

733
01:02:35,008 --> 01:02:37,468
But the more that it's real

734
01:02:38,011 --> 01:02:40,722
The more it's right

735
01:02:42,850 --> 01:02:45,309
What a night

736
01:02:45,728 --> 01:02:48,771
It's as though we've been lovers

737
01:02:48,814 --> 01:02:52,483
All of our lives

738
01:02:52,651 --> 01:02:55,236
There must be a God

739
01:02:56,321 --> 01:03:00,491
Could it be that he's heard me at last?

740
01:03:01,326 --> 01:03:04,495
Because you look at me

741
01:03:06,749 --> 01:03:08,166
As though I'm beautiful

742
01:03:08,250 --> 01:03:10,334
- I can't.
- Yeah, you can. Come on. Come on.

743
01:03:10,377 --> 01:03:12,503
Give me your hand. Just put it right there.

744
01:03:12,588 --> 01:03:15,506
- Like that?
- Yeah. Put this on my shoulder.

745
01:03:15,716 --> 01:03:18,634
- Like that?
- That's right. Okay, just relax.

746
01:03:19,303 --> 01:03:21,262
- All right?
- Okay.

747
01:03:21,513 --> 01:03:24,098
Okay. Just listen to the music.

748
01:03:24,725 --> 01:03:26,309
That's right.

749
01:03:27,102 --> 01:03:29,520
See, you got it. That's good.

750
01:03:30,689 --> 01:03:33,441
You're as good as anyone else out here.

751
01:03:34,401 --> 01:03:35,777
You got it.

752
01:03:40,032 --> 01:03:41,699
- I'm sorry.
- That's all right.

753
01:03:41,742 --> 01:03:44,076
- It's just...
- That's all right.

754
01:03:44,161 --> 01:03:46,579
No harm. No foul.

755
01:03:47,164 --> 01:03:49,040
- I can't do anything.
- Yeah, you can.

756
01:03:49,082 --> 01:03:52,585
I can't dance. I can't even... I don't know.

757
01:04:16,194 --> 01:04:17,736
- Tommy?
- Yeah?

758
01:04:18,029 --> 01:04:19,196
Why...

759
01:04:20,490 --> 01:04:22,783
- Why what?
- Why am I here?

760
01:04:25,495 --> 01:04:27,371
Because it's the prom.

761
01:04:27,497 --> 01:04:29,414
Why am I here with you?

762
01:04:31,835 --> 01:04:33,919
Because I asked you.

763
01:04:36,381 --> 01:04:39,049
- Why'd you ask me?
- 'Cause I wanted to.

764
01:04:41,052 --> 01:04:42,719
Why'd you want to?

765
01:04:43,972 --> 01:04:46,056
Because you liked my poem.

766
01:04:47,725 --> 01:04:50,894
Only I didn't write it. Somebody else did.

767
01:04:53,523 --> 01:04:56,275
Carrie, we're here,

768
01:04:57,527 --> 01:05:01,446
and we're together, and I like it.

769
01:05:02,824 --> 01:05:04,074
I do, I like it.

770
01:05:04,117 --> 01:05:06,451
Where there are other girls

771
01:05:07,036 --> 01:05:11,164
But tonight there's only me

772
01:05:11,416 --> 01:05:16,086
I never dreamed someone like you

773
01:05:16,170 --> 01:05:20,257
Could love someone like me

774
01:05:44,866 --> 01:05:47,326
All right, ladies and gentlemen.

775
01:05:48,077 --> 01:05:51,622
Ladies and gentlemen...
Hey, you two behave yourselves, okay?

776
01:05:51,706 --> 01:05:52,873
We want to dance.

777
01:05:52,957 --> 01:05:58,003
Just take your seats, please, and
we've gotta vote for the king and queen.

778
01:06:06,804 --> 01:06:10,223
- Tommy, we're on here.
- I know.

779
01:06:12,352 --> 01:06:14,019
You want to decline?

780
01:06:15,688 --> 01:06:16,897
Do you?

781
01:06:17,941 --> 01:06:22,986
Hell, no. If you win, all they do is put you
up there for a school song and a dance.

782
01:06:23,154 --> 01:06:25,280
And then some guy takes your picture
for the yearbook,

783
01:06:25,365 --> 01:06:28,700
so everyone can see
we look like a couple of idiots.

784
01:06:30,036 --> 01:06:33,872
- Anyway, it's the last year. Why not?
- It was so beautiful.

785
01:06:38,461 --> 01:06:41,004
Hey, you're beautiful.

786
01:06:48,346 --> 01:06:52,307
Well, who should we vote for?
They're more your crowd than mine.

787
01:06:53,559 --> 01:06:55,560
I don't even have a crowd.

788
01:06:57,188 --> 01:06:59,189
Let's vote for ourselves.

789
01:07:00,483 --> 01:07:02,818
- No.
- Why not?

790
01:07:04,278 --> 01:07:06,613
Please don't vote for ourselves.

791
01:07:09,200 --> 01:07:10,492
Carrie...

792
01:07:18,751 --> 01:07:21,712
Come on. To the devil with false modesty.

793
01:07:23,965 --> 01:07:25,298
The devil.

794
01:08:01,170 --> 01:08:05,131
Billy! Shut up.
Will you close that a little bit?

795
01:08:05,299 --> 01:08:07,425
Jesus, you want to get caught?

796
01:08:07,801 --> 01:08:10,970
- That Carrie White, she sure is cute.
- Shut up.

797
01:08:11,472 --> 01:08:12,597
Thank you very much
for your...

798
01:08:12,639 --> 01:08:14,182
Thought you said they were gonna win.

799
01:08:14,266 --> 01:08:19,687
They will. Won't even be close.
I called in a few favors.

800
01:08:20,105 --> 01:08:22,440
Can I have your ballot, please?

801
01:08:27,279 --> 01:08:29,322
- Hello.
- Hey, thanks, Bobby.

802
01:08:30,324 --> 01:08:33,117
- Ballots. Can I have your ballots, please?
- Thank you.

803
01:08:33,327 --> 01:08:34,494
Thanks.

804
01:08:35,496 --> 01:08:37,997
Well, thank you very much, there.

805
01:08:39,291 --> 01:08:41,042
- Thank you.
- Thanks there.

806
01:08:41,126 --> 01:08:42,502
Thank you.

807
01:08:44,046 --> 01:08:45,671
Thank you, there.

808
01:08:46,006 --> 01:08:47,924
Ballots, please. Thank you.

809
01:08:48,175 --> 01:08:49,300
Thank you.

810
01:08:49,343 --> 01:08:53,554
Now, Freddy, hurry up, please.
Ballots. Ballots.

811
01:08:53,847 --> 01:08:56,349
Good. Good. Thanks a lot there, Vic.

812
01:08:58,894 --> 01:09:01,104
- Get all of them?
- Yeah.

813
01:09:03,899 --> 01:09:07,110
They're right in back of you,
so start kicking.

814
01:09:17,037 --> 01:09:18,371
Good luck.

815
01:09:19,665 --> 01:09:21,624
More ballots? Thank you.

816
01:09:22,918 --> 01:09:25,586
- I have some more ballots for you guys.
- Thank you.

817
01:10:13,594 --> 01:10:16,596
Ladies and gentlemen,
I've got the winners.

818
01:10:17,014 --> 01:10:18,347
All right.

819
01:10:18,891 --> 01:10:22,059
I give you Tommy Ross and Carrie White!

820
01:16:45,696 --> 01:16:47,989
They're all gonna laugh
at you.

821
01:16:48,949 --> 01:16:53,995
They're all gonna laugh at you.

822
01:16:54,079 --> 01:16:59,083
Plug it up! Plug it up! Plug it up!
Plug it up! Plug it up! Plug it up!

823
01:16:59,167 --> 01:17:01,127
- Plug it up! Plug it up!
- They're all gonna laugh at you.

824
01:17:01,169 --> 01:17:02,670
We're all sorry, Cassie.

825
01:17:02,713 --> 01:17:05,673
- They're all gonna laugh at you.
- We're all sorry, Cassie.

826
01:17:05,757 --> 01:17:11,762
Trust me, Carrie. You can trust me.

827
01:17:11,888 --> 01:17:15,099
- Trust me, Carrie. You can trust me.
- They're all gonna laugh at you.

828
01:17:18,353 --> 01:17:21,022
Come on, let's go. Billy.

829
01:17:21,064 --> 01:17:23,983
- They're all gonna laugh at you.
- We're all sorry, Cassie.

830
01:17:24,026 --> 01:17:29,947
- Trust me, Carrie. You can trust me.
- They're all gonna laugh at you.

831
01:17:30,032 --> 01:17:33,117
- We're all sorry, Cassie.
- Trust me, Carrie. You can trust me.

832
01:17:33,201 --> 01:17:34,410
Trust me, Carrie.

833
01:17:46,590 --> 01:17:48,799
Somebody open this door!

834
01:17:49,384 --> 01:17:51,552
What is going on?

835
01:17:54,431 --> 01:17:55,556
Help!

836
01:19:01,581 --> 01:19:04,250
Attention, students! Calm down!

837
01:26:09,761 --> 01:26:16,559
Mama?

838
01:26:17,477 --> 01:26:22,356
Mama. Mama.
It was bad, Mama. They laughed at me.

839
01:26:23,108 --> 01:26:24,608
Mama, hold me.

840
01:26:37,330 --> 01:26:40,457
Hold me, Mama. Please, hold me!

841
01:26:43,628 --> 01:26:46,797
I should have killed myself
when he put it in me.

842
01:26:48,425 --> 01:26:52,887
After the first time, before we were
married, Ralph promised never again.

843
01:26:55,932 --> 01:26:58,851
He promised. And I believed him.

844
01:27:02,105 --> 01:27:03,857
But sin never dies.

845
01:27:05,651 --> 01:27:07,444
Sin never dies.

846
01:27:09,280 --> 01:27:12,699
At first it was all right. We lived sinlessly.

847
01:27:13,993 --> 01:27:16,995
We slept in the same bed,
but we never did it.

848
01:27:19,248 --> 01:27:22,167
And then, that night,

849
01:27:24,795 --> 01:27:27,464
I saw him looking down at me that way.

850
01:27:32,261 --> 01:27:35,263
We got down on our knees
to pray for strength.

851
01:27:37,475 --> 01:27:39,851
I smelt the whisky on his breath.

852
01:27:41,896 --> 01:27:43,521
And he took me.

853
01:27:45,149 --> 01:27:46,483
He took me

854
01:27:48,694 --> 01:27:52,781
with the stink of the filthy
roadhouse whisky on his breath.

855
01:27:53,199 --> 01:27:54,741
And I liked it.

856
01:27:55,409 --> 01:27:57,327
I liked it.

857
01:27:59,872 --> 01:28:04,292
With all that dirty touching
of his hands all over me.

858
01:28:05,127 --> 01:28:08,338
I should have given you to God
when you were born.

859
01:28:09,298 --> 01:28:11,591
But I was weak and backsliding.

860
01:28:16,222 --> 01:28:18,723
And now the devil has come home.

861
01:28:23,771 --> 01:28:26,314
- We'll pray.
- Yes.

862
01:28:30,903 --> 01:28:33,989
We'll pray.

863
01:28:35,032 --> 01:28:37,867
For the last time, we'll pray.

864
01:28:44,041 --> 01:28:47,711
Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name,

865
01:28:48,379 --> 01:28:51,339
thy kingdom come, thy will be done...

866
01:34:12,454 --> 01:34:13,621
Hello?

867
01:34:15,165 --> 01:34:17,207
Oh, Betty, thank God it's you.

868
01:34:17,292 --> 01:34:20,544
I don't think I could've handled
one more reporter.

869
01:34:21,963 --> 01:34:25,257
Yeah, well, we're all a little edgy.

870
01:34:28,136 --> 01:34:31,889
She's better. Sleeping too much, I guess,

871
01:34:32,098 --> 01:34:36,560
but Dr. Schneider said that's to be
expected after all she's been through.

872
01:34:38,480 --> 01:34:43,359
Well, he said that she's young enough
so that she'll forget all about it in time.

873
01:34:43,902 --> 01:34:46,738
No. I wouldn't let her go to the funerals.

874
01:34:47,615 --> 01:34:52,118
With Tommy and all the others gone,
it's best we just go away for a while.

875
01:36:16,871 --> 01:36:18,413
It's all right!

876
01:36:20,374 --> 01:36:22,083
It's all right.

877
01:36:22,168 --> 01:36:24,627
No, no, no!

878
01:36:25,337 --> 01:36:27,672
It's all right.

879
01:36:27,840 --> 01:36:29,424
No!

880
01:36:36,056 --> 01:36:40,310
It's all right. It's all right. I'm here.

881
01:36:40,770 --> 01:36:42,353
It's all right.

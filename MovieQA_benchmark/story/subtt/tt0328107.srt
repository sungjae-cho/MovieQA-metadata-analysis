1
00:01:29,582 --> 00:01:34,457
There is one kidnapping every 60 minutes
in Latin America.

2
00:01:34,545 --> 00:01:38,625
70% ofthe victims do not survive.

3
00:02:29,641 --> 00:02:30,554
?Si? ?Bueno?

4
00:02:30,642 --> 00:02:34,425
Family is everything, no?

5
00:02:34,521 --> 00:02:37,806
Now, do you love your son?

6
00:02:39,275 --> 00:02:40,817
Si.

7
00:02:49,369 --> 00:02:52,987
Now, do you understand?

8
00:02:54,082 --> 00:02:58,494
You have a $10 million insurance policy.
I know that.

9
00:02:59,045 --> 00:03:00,503
Follow these instructions

10
00:03:00,755 --> 00:03:03,246
or God be with your child.

11
00:03:03,758 --> 00:03:05,133
You will remove your shirt

12
00:03:05,218 --> 00:03:07,340
and hold it out the window to ID the car.

13
00:03:08,304 --> 00:03:10,296
Be professional.

14
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:12,303
Come alone.

15
00:03:21,942 --> 00:03:24,693
!Porfavor!!Ayùdenme!

16
00:03:32,536 --> 00:03:35,323
!Ayùdenme, porfavor!

17
00:04:05,861 --> 00:04:08,980
EL PASO, TEXAS
US / MEXICO BORDER

18
00:05:08,005 --> 00:05:13,509
Georgina! Obey me.
I will love you. Come on.

19
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:16,793
- That's how it works, huh?
- That's right.

20
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:27,185
She got a sister?

21
00:05:28,109 --> 00:05:30,185
How's business?

22
00:05:31,445 --> 00:05:34,398
The Japanese are here in a big way.

23
00:05:35,449 --> 00:05:42,412
Cheap labour, factory space, but they feel
a lot safer living over the border in EI Paso.

24
00:05:42,498 --> 00:05:47,574
I ferry them back and forth.
They think I'm John Wayne.

25
00:05:52,007 --> 00:05:55,292
- I live like a king down here.
- Yes, you do.

26
00:05:58,847 --> 00:06:02,132
- You been workin'?
- Yeah. No.

27
00:06:02,226 --> 00:06:06,887
No. I've been movin' around. You know.
Colombia, a couple of places I can't name.

28
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:10,265
Nothin' catches my fancy.

29
00:06:13,403 --> 00:06:16,902
You think God'll forgive us
for what we've done?

30
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:19,196
- No.
- You don't?

31
00:06:19,284 --> 00:06:20,612
Me either.

32
00:06:22,871 --> 00:06:27,829
- How long you stayin'?
- I don't know, I just... you know.

33
00:06:27,918 --> 00:06:31,915
I wanted to see you, Ray,
see how you're doin'.

34
00:06:32,005 --> 00:06:34,578
I just came by on impulse.

35
00:06:34,674 --> 00:06:37,211
I could do with some impulse.

36
00:06:48,104 --> 00:06:50,180
What happened?

37
00:06:51,357 --> 00:06:57,774
Family paid the ransom, then they
sent the kid home after a couple of days.

38
00:06:57,864 --> 00:07:00,022
Minus an ear, of course.

39
00:07:00,116 --> 00:07:03,816
Now every mother in Mexico City
with money wants bigger bodyguards.

40
00:07:03,912 --> 00:07:08,205
- My own wife included.
- I hate to break it to you, but she's right.

41
00:07:08,291 --> 00:07:10,698
She's right.

42
00:07:10,793 --> 00:07:15,205
Look, Sammy, all my clients
have kidnap and ransom insurance.

43
00:07:15,298 --> 00:07:18,548
I have a policy.
AIG. My dad gave it to me.

44
00:07:18,634 --> 00:07:21,504
Yeah, I know. I got it for your dad.

45
00:07:21,596 --> 00:07:26,257
But what'll you do in 60 days when you can't
renew it because you have no bodyguard?

46
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:29,220
I know. I had to let Emilio go.

47
00:07:29,312 --> 00:07:34,436
Well, you gotta please Lisa.
I mean, ass like that's hard to find.

48
00:07:35,484 --> 00:07:37,560
Look.

49
00:07:37,653 --> 00:07:42,991
A bodyguard's like anything else.
You get what you pay for, OK?

50
00:07:43,075 --> 00:07:46,028
You could do this.
Get one that's got a decent résumé.

51
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:50,248
We're not lookin' for goddamn Superman,
right? Get someone cheap.

52
00:07:50,332 --> 00:07:56,951
So you renew the policy, and then
fire the prick for whatever - incompetence.

53
00:07:57,047 --> 00:08:01,708
All kidding aside, the most important thing
is that your daughter goes back to school,

54
00:08:01,802 --> 00:08:04,755
and that your wife gets to save face.

55
00:08:04,847 --> 00:08:11,348
This way you won't be the only
unprotected family in the neighbourhood.

56
00:08:21,613 --> 00:08:25,776
That's right, a bodyguard.
Your Spanish is good enough.

57
00:08:25,867 --> 00:08:28,951
- You're crazy.
- You even look the part.

58
00:08:29,037 --> 00:08:31,029
In my state, I couldn't guard a corpse.

59
00:08:31,123 --> 00:08:35,120
It's rich guys flashing their cash.
It's all for show. Nothing's gonna happen.

60
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:39,706
Yeah? You think they'd
hire a drunk, a has-been?

61
00:08:41,091 --> 00:08:43,332
You have to keep it under control.

62
00:08:44,719 --> 00:08:49,546
What ifthere was, you know... just, say,
a kidnapping attempt? What do I do then?

63
00:08:49,641 --> 00:08:54,516
You do your best. They're not gonna be
paying you enough to perform miracles.

64
00:08:54,604 --> 00:08:59,016
It's not exactly a scam, Crease.
Even at half speed, you're pretty damn good.

65
00:08:59,109 --> 00:09:02,857
Yeah. A bodyguard's gotta
be close to people, though.

66
00:09:02,946 --> 00:09:05,982
They talk all the time.
You know I'm no good at that.

67
00:09:06,074 --> 00:09:10,118
You'll be the silent type.
They're gonna appreciate that.

68
00:09:17,669 --> 00:09:19,957
Bodyguard. So who's the guy?

69
00:09:20,046 --> 00:09:22,833
Samuel Ramos. He's a young guy.

70
00:09:22,924 --> 00:09:27,217
- He owns one ofthe plants in Juàrez.
- Yeah?

71
00:09:27,303 --> 00:09:29,758
The Jap car industry is in the toilet.

72
00:09:29,847 --> 00:09:33,262
He's trying to persuade Ford
to partner with him.

73
00:09:33,351 --> 00:09:37,182
I think he's in trouble.
His family lives in Mexico City.

74
00:09:37,271 --> 00:09:41,220
He asked me if I knew anybody he could trust.

75
00:09:41,317 --> 00:09:44,317
- And you thought of me?
- Yeah.

76
00:09:44,403 --> 00:09:47,937
Take ajob, Crease. Breathe some air.

77
00:09:48,032 --> 00:09:50,273
Then decide ifyou want to stick around.

78
00:09:50,368 --> 00:09:54,661
Besides, I'm glad to see you, you know?
I got nobody to talk to down here.

79
00:10:02,254 --> 00:10:07,248
Listen, my wife wants
someone presentable and polite.

80
00:10:07,343 --> 00:10:10,877
You'll be the fifth candidate
she sees this week.

81
00:10:10,971 --> 00:10:12,714
Your résumé's quite impressive.

82
00:10:12,806 --> 00:10:17,349
16 years of military experience,
extensive counter-terrorism work.

83
00:10:17,436 --> 00:10:20,851
I'm surprised anybody could afford you.
What's the catch?

84
00:10:20,939 --> 00:10:23,145
I drink.

85
00:10:23,233 --> 00:10:25,309
How does that affect you?

86
00:10:27,905 --> 00:10:30,027
Coordination, reaction time.

87
00:10:30,115 --> 00:10:33,649
Iftop professionals try to kidnap
your daughter, I'll do the best I can,

88
00:10:33,744 --> 00:10:36,235
but the service will be on a par with the pay.

89
00:10:38,248 --> 00:10:40,240
What if amateurs try it?

90
00:10:40,334 --> 00:10:43,667
I'd probably kill 'em. Is that likely?

91
00:10:43,754 --> 00:10:45,627
No.

92
00:10:45,714 --> 00:10:50,956
No one is to know about your drinking.
That includes my wife.

93
00:11:16,286 --> 00:11:18,362
Lisa!

94
00:11:20,373 --> 00:11:22,449
Lisa!

95
00:11:34,387 --> 00:11:37,553
My wife Lisa.
And this is John Creasy.

96
00:11:43,521 --> 00:11:45,809
- You're an American.
- So are you.

97
00:11:47,191 --> 00:11:48,649
It's all in there.

98
00:11:53,614 --> 00:11:57,445
- Would you like a drink?
- Yes. Jack and water would be good.

99
00:11:58,786 --> 00:12:01,241
Have you done much of
this kind ofwork before?

100
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:02,492
No, ma'am.

101
00:12:02,581 --> 00:12:06,412
But he has a lot of experience
in related fields.

102
00:12:08,796 --> 00:12:11,631
- Do you have a family, Mr Creasy?
- No.

103
00:12:12,174 --> 00:12:14,665
Pita? Pita.

104
00:12:18,472 --> 00:12:21,425
- Yes, Mom?
- Honey, this is Mr Creasy.

105
00:12:23,602 --> 00:12:26,472
Buenas tardes, señor Creasy.
Mucho gusto en conocerle.

106
00:12:26,563 --> 00:12:31,557
It's English, honey. Do you wanna
show Mr Creasy to his room?

107
00:12:31,652 --> 00:12:34,107
- This way, Mr Creasy.
- OK.

108
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:46,036
Thank you.

109
00:12:52,923 --> 00:12:54,298
Just like that?

110
00:12:55,759 --> 00:13:00,800
I think it's nice that he's an American.

111
00:13:00,889 --> 00:13:05,135
I think it's terrific. Are you sure?

112
00:13:07,771 --> 00:13:09,644
Thank you.

113
00:13:09,981 --> 00:13:11,605
Thank you.

114
00:13:12,651 --> 00:13:14,727
I feel better now.

115
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,984
- !Hola, Bruno!
- Buenas tardes.

116
00:13:20,075 --> 00:13:24,736
That's Bruno, the gardener.
And that's Maria, the cook.

117
00:13:24,829 --> 00:13:27,699
- !Hola, Maria!
- Hola, Pita.

118
00:13:29,918 --> 00:13:33,998
We fixed the room up two weeks ago.
It's nicer than before.

119
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:40,999
You've got a TV and a CD player.
What kind of music do you like, Mr Creasy?

120
00:13:41,095 --> 00:13:44,760
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

121
00:13:44,849 --> 00:13:47,719
I don't know.

122
00:13:47,810 --> 00:13:52,388
That's Bird. Emilio forgot
to take him when he left.

123
00:13:53,441 --> 00:13:55,813
Emilio was my last bodyguard.

124
00:13:57,778 --> 00:14:02,024
Have you protected
a lot of children before, Mr Creasy?

125
00:14:02,116 --> 00:14:05,864
Creasy. You can call me Creasy.
And no, you're the first.

126
00:14:05,953 --> 00:14:07,779
Creasy.

127
00:14:07,872 --> 00:14:10,160
Bye, Creasy.

128
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:14,583
Bye, Bird.

129
00:14:24,305 --> 00:14:29,346
- School tomorrow, Peeps.
- Does that mean we can get a dog?

130
00:14:29,435 --> 00:14:31,890
Dad promised me one
when I went back to school.

131
00:14:31,979 --> 00:14:34,137
Yeah, we'll see.

132
00:14:34,231 --> 00:14:39,225
Ifyou get a dog, will you give up your bear?
You're getting too old for him.

133
00:14:42,072 --> 00:14:47,825
- How did you like Mr Creasy?
- Creasy. He said to call him just Creasy.

134
00:14:47,911 --> 00:14:51,955
- That isn't disrespectful, is it?
- No, not if he asked you.

135
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:54,957
Here. There you go.

136
00:15:02,843 --> 00:15:04,882
He's like a bear, too.

137
00:15:05,762 --> 00:15:07,968
- Yeah?
- A big, sad bear.

138
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:14,264
- Is he sad?
- I think. Or something.

139
00:15:18,733 --> 00:15:20,809
Good night, honey.

140
00:15:22,904 --> 00:15:25,525
Can you get me some floss in the morning?

141
00:15:25,615 --> 00:15:27,572
- Floss?
- Yeah, the strawberry kind.

142
00:15:27,659 --> 00:15:29,485
Sure.

143
00:15:32,539 --> 00:15:34,615
Good night, Bear.

144
00:15:35,667 --> 00:15:37,743
Creasy Bear.

145
00:16:11,077 --> 00:16:15,573
- What's that one for?
- La Virgen de Guadalupe.

146
00:16:15,665 --> 00:16:19,496
Business. For Toyota, for Ford.

147
00:16:19,585 --> 00:16:25,089
If one dies, maybe she can
resurrect the other one. I don't know.

148
00:16:27,384 --> 00:16:29,460
She likes him.

149
00:16:30,429 --> 00:16:33,465
- What are you talkin' about?
- Creasy.

150
00:16:34,975 --> 00:16:37,051
Pita likes him.

151
00:16:38,562 --> 00:16:44,931
Pita loves school. Pita would love Count
Dracula if he took her back there, honey.

152
00:16:45,027 --> 00:16:46,900
OK?

153
00:16:48,781 --> 00:16:51,485
Hey. Are you OK?

154
00:16:51,575 --> 00:16:54,030
- I don't know.
- OK?

155
00:16:56,371 --> 00:17:00,036
I don't know, Lisa. I'm trying.

156
00:17:56,347 --> 00:17:58,220
Come on, Bird.

157
00:17:58,308 --> 00:18:01,261
That's right, that's right. Come on.

158
00:18:01,352 --> 00:18:03,095
All right.

159
00:18:03,187 --> 00:18:05,096
Home to Emilio.

160
00:18:06,065 --> 00:18:08,057
You're home free, baby.

161
00:18:28,129 --> 00:18:30,916
- Where are you from, Creasy?
- The US.

162
00:18:31,006 --> 00:18:33,959
- I know, but which state?
- No state in particular.

163
00:18:34,051 --> 00:18:41,714
- You can drive and talk at the same time.
- No, I can't, Pita, so please let me do myjob.

164
00:18:41,809 --> 00:18:43,516
Are you going to stay?

165
00:18:44,937 --> 00:18:49,764
My last bodyguard left. Somebody
gave him more money than we could.

166
00:18:49,858 --> 00:18:53,807
I guess that makes me a bargain, then, huh?

167
00:18:53,904 --> 00:18:59,064
Being black. Is that a positive or a negative
for a bodyguard in Mexico?

168
00:18:59,159 --> 00:19:01,365
Time will tell.

169
00:19:03,914 --> 00:19:08,042
There were 24 kidnappings in Mexico City
in the last six days.

170
00:19:08,126 --> 00:19:10,699
- Four a day.
- Yeah? 24?

171
00:19:10,796 --> 00:19:14,579
- 24. What do you think about that?
- I think you know more than you should.

172
00:19:14,675 --> 00:19:16,501
Well, thank you.

173
00:19:44,746 --> 00:19:47,581
- See you later.
- You have to sign.

174
00:19:47,666 --> 00:19:51,034
- What?
- You have to sign in. Show them your ID.

175
00:19:51,127 --> 00:19:53,203
- Buenos dias.
- Buenos dias.

176
00:19:53,296 --> 00:19:54,624
Come on.

177
00:19:55,882 --> 00:19:57,625
Right there.

178
00:19:57,717 --> 00:20:00,421
- Hola, Manuel.
- Hola, Pita.

179
00:20:10,438 --> 00:20:13,107
- !Hola, Pita!
- !Hola!

180
00:20:13,566 --> 00:20:16,981
Pita! It's so good to have you back.

181
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:20,403
Sister Anna,
this is my new bodyguard, Creasy.

182
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:24,570
- Sister Anna, the headmistress.
- Señor Creasy.

183
00:20:25,828 --> 00:20:30,205
- Hurry. Class is about to begin. Go, go.
- Bye, Creasy.

184
00:20:30,291 --> 00:20:31,405
Madre.

185
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:35,082
You must look after our Pita.
It is not good that she is late today.

186
00:20:35,171 --> 00:20:39,631
I'm very sorry. I have to get used to
the routes. It won't happen again.

187
00:20:39,717 --> 00:20:43,465
No offence, but I regret that
your profession needs to exist.

188
00:20:43,554 --> 00:20:46,638
So do l, Madre, so do l.

189
00:20:46,724 --> 00:20:50,472
Do you ever see the hand of God
in what you do?

190
00:20:52,146 --> 00:20:54,222
No, not for a long time.

191
00:20:54,315 --> 00:20:57,185
The Bible says, "Be not overcome of evil..."

192
00:20:57,276 --> 00:21:01,487
"But overcome evil with good."

193
00:21:01,572 --> 00:21:04,442
That's Romans Chapter 12 Verse 21.

194
00:21:07,411 --> 00:21:10,447
I am the sheep that got lost, Madre.

195
00:22:13,810 --> 00:22:18,187
When you were a kid, Creasy,
did you like school?

196
00:22:18,273 --> 00:22:20,645
- I don't remember.
- You don't remember?

197
00:22:20,733 --> 00:22:24,647
No, I don't remember.
No, I didn't like it.

198
00:22:24,737 --> 00:22:27,025
Why not?

199
00:22:27,115 --> 00:22:31,611
Because it wasn't a school like yours, Pita.
There was no Sister Anna.

200
00:22:34,288 --> 00:22:36,660
Were you unhappy?

201
00:22:38,793 --> 00:22:42,244
Being unhappy, that's a state of mind.
I really don't remember.

202
00:22:51,639 --> 00:22:54,011
What happened to your hand?

203
00:22:55,392 --> 00:22:57,183
- It's a birth defect.
- No, it's not.

204
00:22:57,269 --> 00:22:58,763
Look, no more questions, OK?

205
00:23:01,649 --> 00:23:05,516
- It really wasn't a question.
- It sounded like a question to me.

206
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:09,061
No, gracias. Gracias, no, no.

207
00:23:09,156 --> 00:23:11,528
Listen to me.
I'm being paid to protect you.

208
00:23:11,617 --> 00:23:12,648
No, no, no.

209
00:23:12,743 --> 00:23:16,277
I'm being paid to be your bodyguard.
Look at me.

210
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:23,164
I'm not being paid to be your friend, but
to protect you. So no more questions, period.

211
00:23:25,130 --> 00:23:26,707
- Do you hear me?
- Yes.

212
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:32,131
- No crying.
- I'm not crying.

213
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:35,302
Well, don't start.

214
00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:38,889
You gotta understand, this is ajob.
In order for me to do myjob...

215
00:23:41,563 --> 00:23:43,851
Wait a minute.

216
00:24:32,155 --> 00:24:34,231
Yeah, come in.

217
00:24:39,829 --> 00:24:41,905
Mr Creasy.

218
00:24:42,623 --> 00:24:45,576
I just wanted to make sure
you have everything you need.

219
00:24:45,668 --> 00:24:47,126
I'm fine, thanks.

220
00:24:48,754 --> 00:24:53,250
Is the food all right?
Because Maria told me you didn't eat.

221
00:24:54,844 --> 00:24:59,589
Yeah, the food is great.
I just wasn't that hungry tonight.

222
00:25:02,059 --> 00:25:04,728
So you read the Bible?

223
00:25:05,563 --> 00:25:08,314
Yeah, sometimes.

224
00:25:08,399 --> 00:25:10,521
Does it help?

225
00:25:10,609 --> 00:25:12,316
Yeah, sometimes.

226
00:25:14,572 --> 00:25:17,775
- Can I talk to you for a minute?
- Sure.

227
00:25:19,785 --> 00:25:22,738
How are you doing with Pita?

228
00:25:22,830 --> 00:25:24,407
Fine.

229
00:25:24,498 --> 00:25:28,032
As soon as she figures out that
I'm not her new toy, it'll be fine.

230
00:25:28,127 --> 00:25:30,618
- She told me about that.
- OK.

231
00:25:32,172 --> 00:25:35,540
- You don't have children, do you?
- I told you I didn't.

232
00:25:35,634 --> 00:25:38,587
Well, they can be tenacious
when they want something.

233
00:25:38,679 --> 00:25:41,300
And Pitajust wants to be friends.

234
00:25:41,390 --> 00:25:43,049
OK.

235
00:25:43,141 --> 00:25:48,645
But you're paying me to protect her,
not to be her friend, right?

236
00:25:50,148 --> 00:25:52,224
So...

237
00:25:53,527 --> 00:25:56,018
Look, maybe this isn't gonna work out.

238
00:25:56,113 --> 00:26:01,320
Maybe your husband should find
somebody that's a little more sociable.

239
00:26:03,703 --> 00:26:05,078
No, you're right.

240
00:26:07,624 --> 00:26:10,375
You're being paid to protect her.

241
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:13,994
And I'm confident that you'll do that.

242
00:26:18,468 --> 00:26:23,462
I'll be coming with you tomorrow.
I hope that's all right.

243
00:26:52,543 --> 00:26:55,793
You think God'll forgive us
for what we've done?

244
00:27:21,447 --> 00:27:25,396
I'm tired of killin', Ray.
I'm tired of killin', Ray.

245
00:27:28,370 --> 00:27:32,830
You think God'll forgive us
for what we've done?

246
00:27:32,916 --> 00:27:35,122
In my state, I couldn't...

247
00:27:35,210 --> 00:27:37,332
I couldn't guard a corpse.

248
00:27:37,421 --> 00:27:39,413
They talk all the time.

249
00:27:39,506 --> 00:27:42,341
You know I'm no good at that.

250
00:27:42,718 --> 00:27:45,553
You know I'm no good at that.

251
00:27:46,763 --> 00:27:48,589
You know how they say...

252
00:27:50,392 --> 00:27:53,392
a bullet always tells the truth?

253
00:28:34,602 --> 00:28:36,393
Yeah?

254
00:28:36,479 --> 00:28:38,720
- Hey.
- Crease.

255
00:28:38,815 --> 00:28:40,474
What's wrong?

256
00:28:40,567 --> 00:28:46,652
Hey, listen, you ever have
a 9mm round that didn't go off?

257
00:28:46,739 --> 00:28:49,360
Yeah. Failure to fire.

258
00:28:49,450 --> 00:28:52,616
I know, failure to fire and...

259
00:28:52,704 --> 00:28:57,745
You know, I pulled the trigger
and click - nothing.

260
00:28:57,834 --> 00:29:02,294
- You're talkin' about a bad primer.
- Yeah, yeah, but l...

261
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:07,125
Yeah, right. Dimple on the primer.
That may be...

262
00:29:07,218 --> 00:29:09,590
Well, like we used to say...

263
00:29:10,930 --> 00:29:13,717
a bullet always tells the truth.

264
00:29:20,815 --> 00:29:23,685
Crease? You all right?

265
00:29:23,776 --> 00:29:25,519
Yeah.

266
00:29:26,570 --> 00:29:28,977
What were you shootin' at?

267
00:29:29,073 --> 00:29:31,361
Yeah, I'm sorry, Ray. I'm sorry I woke you.

268
00:29:31,450 --> 00:29:35,494
No, it's OK, it's nothin'. I was watchin' TV.

269
00:29:37,373 --> 00:29:39,449
OK.

270
00:30:59,078 --> 00:31:01,699
Pita, you have a pencil?

271
00:31:06,169 --> 00:31:07,828
Thank you.

272
00:31:41,537 --> 00:31:46,448
- It's hard to get used to the traffic down here.
- Yeah. I'm very sorry.

273
00:32:07,104 --> 00:32:09,226
- See you, baby.
- See you later.

274
00:32:09,314 --> 00:32:13,643
- Hey, don't forget your towel.
- Thank you.

275
00:32:19,157 --> 00:32:21,030
Bye.

276
00:33:26,682 --> 00:33:29,635
- You're a strong swimmer.
- I never win.

277
00:33:35,566 --> 00:33:37,439
Thanks.

278
00:33:40,738 --> 00:33:43,442
So, what do I do?

279
00:33:43,532 --> 00:33:47,031
You're the fastest in the water,
the slowest offthe blocks.

280
00:33:47,119 --> 00:33:49,491
What do you think that means?
What you gotta do?

281
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:52,699
- Get faster offthe blocks?
- Get faster offthe blocks.

282
00:33:53,709 --> 00:33:56,116
- Our big swim meet is in three weeks.
- Yeah?

283
00:33:56,212 --> 00:34:01,965
- I was gonna enter the 150 freestyle.
- You'll be fine. You'll be OK.

284
00:34:03,677 --> 00:34:06,049
- I'll still be slow.
- You're not slow.

285
00:34:06,138 --> 00:34:11,345
- I never finish better than third.
- Then maybe you are slow.

286
00:34:14,021 --> 00:34:17,306
With us this evening we have
Mariana Guerrero from Reforma newspaper

287
00:34:17,399 --> 00:34:19,771
to speak with us about the kidnappings.

288
00:34:20,903 --> 00:34:24,153
Who are the ones responsible
for the kidnappings in Mexico?

289
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:27,987
It is an activity of organised crime.
It's not a random kidnapping.

290
00:34:28,076 --> 00:34:30,282
They are not political kidnappings
like in Colombia.

291
00:34:30,370 --> 00:34:32,611
!Vamos, Bird!

292
00:34:32,706 --> 00:34:34,782
!Vamos!

293
00:34:40,505 --> 00:34:43,209
How do you think he got out?

294
00:34:44,843 --> 00:34:46,218
I let him go.

295
00:34:46,303 --> 00:34:49,968
- It's better to be free, right?
- It's better for him.

296
00:34:51,683 --> 00:34:54,636
Actually, he was driving me crazy.

297
00:34:58,231 --> 00:35:00,140
Good night.

298
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:07,106
Good night.

299
00:35:22,338 --> 00:35:25,255
- See you in a couple of days, OK? I love you.
- Love you.

300
00:35:25,341 --> 00:35:27,214
Be good. Come on, Lise.

301
00:35:27,301 --> 00:35:30,800
All right, sweetheart,
so we'll call you from Detroit, OK?

302
00:35:31,639 --> 00:35:33,797
- I love you.
- Love you.

303
00:35:33,891 --> 00:35:36,013
- OK, bye.
- Señora, su café.

304
00:35:36,102 --> 00:35:38,094
Gracias.

305
00:35:38,187 --> 00:35:42,564
- OK, bye, honey. I love you!
- Love you.

306
00:35:47,613 --> 00:35:49,439
I hate leaving her.

307
00:36:03,003 --> 00:36:05,244
Concentrating?

308
00:36:05,339 --> 00:36:07,415
Eyes are closed?

309
00:36:11,679 --> 00:36:13,470
- What happened?
- I flinched.

310
00:36:13,555 --> 00:36:15,962
The gunshot holds no fear. Say it.

311
00:36:16,058 --> 00:36:19,473
- The gunshot holds no fear.
- The gunshot holds no fear! Say it!

312
00:36:19,561 --> 00:36:21,268
- The gunshot holds no fear.
- Louder!

313
00:36:21,355 --> 00:36:23,596
- The gunshot holds no fear!
- Louder!

314
00:36:23,690 --> 00:36:27,308
- The gunshot holds no fear!
- That's good. You welcome the sound.

315
00:36:27,402 --> 00:36:29,524
In fact, it's the sound that sets you free.

316
00:36:29,613 --> 00:36:33,990
You are a prisoner on this block until
that sound sets you free. Are you ready?

317
00:36:34,076 --> 00:36:36,780
- Yes.
- Are you ready? Are you set?

318
00:36:44,836 --> 00:36:46,912
Creasy?

319
00:36:47,005 --> 00:36:49,330
What's a concubine?

320
00:36:49,424 --> 00:36:52,709
- Why do you ask?
- It's in my history book.

321
00:36:53,762 --> 00:36:57,545
- It's like a wife, right?
- Yeah, yeah, it's...

322
00:36:57,641 --> 00:37:00,013
Can I see that? It's kind of a wife.

323
00:37:00,101 --> 00:37:01,476
Right there.

324
00:37:01,561 --> 00:37:04,846
But the Emperor of China had 1,000 ofthem.

325
00:37:06,650 --> 00:37:10,599
OK, like nowadays, in the West,
they have one husband for one wife.

326
00:37:10,695 --> 00:37:17,444
But in the olden-time cultures they had,
you know, different... different rules.

327
00:37:19,245 --> 00:37:21,321
Why? You feel sorry for the husband?

328
00:37:21,414 --> 00:37:25,660
Yeah. Can you imagine my mom
multiplied by a thousand?

329
00:37:27,170 --> 00:37:29,625
Creasy.

330
00:37:29,714 --> 00:37:32,335
- You're smiling.
- What?

331
00:37:32,425 --> 00:37:34,666
- You were smiling.
- No, I'm not.

332
00:37:34,761 --> 00:37:36,005
- You were.
- No, I was not.

333
00:37:36,095 --> 00:37:38,846
- You're not now, but you were.
- Youwere smiling. I wasn't.

334
00:37:38,931 --> 00:37:40,341
- You were.
- When?

335
00:37:40,433 --> 00:37:42,970
- Five seconds ago.
- I'm not smiling.

336
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:47,768
- Well, a second ago you were.
- You said five seconds ago. Now that's six.

337
00:37:47,857 --> 00:37:50,063
- Ten seconds ago.
- Ten seconds ago I was smiling.

338
00:37:50,151 --> 00:37:54,231
OK, in the next ten seconds,
we'll see who smiles first.

339
00:37:57,700 --> 00:38:00,191
- You smiled already. See? You did.
- You.

340
00:38:00,286 --> 00:38:02,777
No, that wasn't a... That was a smirk.

341
00:38:02,872 --> 00:38:08,577
That's not a smile. A smirk is different. They
both start with S, but they're not the same...

342
00:38:08,669 --> 00:38:11,456
- Do your homework.
- You were.

343
00:38:14,508 --> 00:38:16,381
Bang!

344
00:38:17,344 --> 00:38:20,013
Stop, stop, stop.
Come back, come back.

345
00:38:20,097 --> 00:38:21,377
Bang!

346
00:38:23,017 --> 00:38:24,926
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

347
00:38:25,019 --> 00:38:28,434
Come here. Hurry up, hurry up.

348
00:38:28,522 --> 00:38:30,181
Set.

349
00:38:30,274 --> 00:38:32,765
Bang! Bang!

350
00:38:35,946 --> 00:38:40,323
You don't flinch when you hear
the gunshot, understand?

351
00:38:40,409 --> 00:38:45,616
Listen for the sound. You don't anticipate.
Concentrate on the sound. Understand me?

352
00:38:45,706 --> 00:38:47,782
They're gaining on you. Go, go, go, go!

353
00:38:47,874 --> 00:38:52,251
Stop, stop! Come on, get out. Let's go again.

354
00:39:07,978 --> 00:39:11,512
?Yqué? ?Todo bien?
Las maletas, porfavor.

355
00:39:11,606 --> 00:39:13,100
- Daddy!
- Come here, girl.

356
00:39:14,609 --> 00:39:17,728
- I missed you so much.
- I missed you.

357
00:39:17,821 --> 00:39:21,024
I got a surprise for you. Are you ready?

358
00:39:21,574 --> 00:39:23,650
You got me a dog! You got me a dog!

359
00:39:24,327 --> 00:39:27,244
- You bought me a dog! Oh, my gosh!
- What do you think?

360
00:39:27,330 --> 00:39:30,829
Oh, my gosh.
Just what I wanted. What's his name?

361
00:39:30,917 --> 00:39:33,917
- Sam. Like Dad.
- Come on, Sam! Come on, Sam!

362
00:39:35,546 --> 00:39:37,622
State...

363
00:39:40,093 --> 00:39:42,963
Bhutan. It's a Himalayan kingdom.

364
00:39:43,054 --> 00:39:46,636
They were having some problems
with the royal family not long ago.

365
00:39:46,724 --> 00:39:48,431
OK.

366
00:39:50,311 --> 00:39:52,766
Any more questions?

367
00:39:52,855 --> 00:39:58,145
- Do you have a girlfriend, Creasy?
- What? No. What kind of question is that?

368
00:39:58,236 --> 00:40:01,521
- You're supposed to be studying history.
- It's Creasy history.

369
00:40:01,614 --> 00:40:04,531
- No, ancient history.
- Who was your very first girlfriend?

370
00:40:04,617 --> 00:40:05,731
- Nonya.
- Nonya?

371
00:40:05,826 --> 00:40:09,277
Nonya business, that's who. OK?

372
00:40:09,997 --> 00:40:11,954
Hi.

373
00:40:12,041 --> 00:40:15,741
Tomorrow after you drop off Pita,
could you take me to get my hair done?

374
00:40:15,836 --> 00:40:17,912
Yes, ma'am.

375
00:40:18,005 --> 00:40:21,005
All right. Well, I'll...

376
00:40:21,091 --> 00:40:23,795
I'll leave you to your history.

377
00:40:23,886 --> 00:40:26,803
- Good night.
- Good night, honey.

378
00:40:29,141 --> 00:40:31,714
- OK, now ask me.
- Ask you what?

379
00:40:38,108 --> 00:40:41,192
Go, Pita! Go, go, go, go, go!

380
00:40:41,278 --> 00:40:43,270
!Ràpido!!Ràpido!

381
00:40:43,363 --> 00:40:45,854
Go, go, go, go, go!

382
00:40:45,949 --> 00:40:48,321
!Bravo, Pita!

383
00:40:49,578 --> 00:40:51,819
- 10.99.
- Yes!

384
00:40:55,125 --> 00:40:57,698
- I'm tough, Creasy.
- No such thing as tough.

385
00:40:57,794 --> 00:41:01,162
There's trained and there's untrained.
Now, which are you?

386
00:41:01,256 --> 00:41:04,707
- Trained.
- Trained. OK, we'll go again.

387
00:41:13,059 --> 00:41:15,135
- Here.
- Stand here near the finish line.

388
00:41:15,228 --> 00:41:16,852
OK. Hey.

389
00:41:16,938 --> 00:41:20,141
I'm a prisoner in the block
until the gunshot sets me free.

390
00:41:20,233 --> 00:41:24,147
That's right. Don't smile, don't fool around
ifyou wanna win. Trained or untrained?

391
00:41:24,237 --> 00:41:25,896
- Trained.
- Go.

392
00:41:26,948 --> 00:41:31,656
- Señor Creasy, nice to see you.
- Good to see you, Madre.

393
00:41:31,745 --> 00:41:34,414
Pita's parents are away on business in Juàrez.

394
00:41:34,497 --> 00:41:37,166
Today, you are her father.

395
00:42:59,915 --> 00:43:02,488
!Yla ganadora es Pita Ramos!

396
00:43:08,173 --> 00:43:11,339
I won, Creasy! I won!

397
00:43:11,426 --> 00:43:13,917
- OK.
- I won!

398
00:43:24,231 --> 00:43:28,727
- Once upon a time, when we were young...
- When lwas young.

399
00:43:28,818 --> 00:43:31,818
Well, when we were young
and he was younger,

400
00:43:31,905 --> 00:43:34,775
and all heads turned our way,

401
00:43:34,866 --> 00:43:37,487
we made a deal to take the world together.

402
00:43:37,577 --> 00:43:41,526
Yeah, then one day I got a call,
and you said...

403
00:43:41,623 --> 00:43:45,038
"I'm in love, I'm in love!"

404
00:43:45,126 --> 00:43:47,581
"And I'm movin' to Mexico!"

405
00:43:47,670 --> 00:43:50,207
And I said, "Huh?"

406
00:43:50,298 --> 00:43:53,832
I said, "What happened to the plan?
What happened to it?"

407
00:43:53,927 --> 00:43:58,754
- I said, "The plan's right here!"
- Yeah, yeah. And what'd I do?

408
00:43:58,848 --> 00:44:01,173
I hung up. And then I met Alicia.

409
00:44:01,267 --> 00:44:05,560
And then I went, "Now I got ya. I got ya."

410
00:44:05,646 --> 00:44:08,433
I got it. Can I kiss her?

411
00:44:08,524 --> 00:44:10,516
Absolutely.

412
00:44:10,610 --> 00:44:13,361
Hey, what are you doin'?

413
00:44:17,825 --> 00:44:22,533
- You got me.
- OK, I think now's as good a time as any.

414
00:44:25,374 --> 00:44:28,125
I bought it with my own money.

415
00:44:30,046 --> 00:44:32,122
Thank you.

416
00:44:33,716 --> 00:44:35,792
Open it.

417
00:44:40,139 --> 00:44:44,717
It's Saint Jude, the patron saint of lost causes.

418
00:44:48,522 --> 00:44:50,514
Well deserved.

419
00:44:54,570 --> 00:44:57,357
Thank you, Pita. It's beautiful.

420
00:44:58,824 --> 00:45:00,900
You're welcome.

421
00:45:50,250 --> 00:45:52,289
- Dad?
- Yes, sweetie?

422
00:45:52,377 --> 00:45:54,950
- Can I talk to you?
- Yes.

423
00:45:56,589 --> 00:45:59,625
I don't wanna play piano, I wanna swim.

424
00:45:59,717 --> 00:46:04,046
It's not open for discussion, honey, OK?
Mr Lozzi's a very, very famous teacher.

425
00:46:04,138 --> 00:46:08,467
If he accepts you as a student,
you're gonna play the piano. Sorry.

426
00:46:08,559 --> 00:46:10,516
- Whatever.
- Baby.

427
00:46:13,064 --> 00:46:15,685
- I love you.
- Love you.

428
00:46:15,775 --> 00:46:19,025
- I just want what's best for you, you know?
- OK.

429
00:46:19,112 --> 00:46:21,353
OK, honey.

430
00:46:31,540 --> 00:46:34,327
Ifyou broke all my fingers,
then taped them back together,

431
00:46:34,418 --> 00:46:37,288
I wouldn't be able to play piano,
but I could still swim.

432
00:46:37,380 --> 00:46:39,668
Sam, get back.

433
00:46:39,757 --> 00:46:42,757
Don't be a crybaby.
You're tougher than that.

434
00:46:42,843 --> 00:46:44,919
Sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit.

435
00:46:48,182 --> 00:46:50,719
Remember the day you wanted the pencil?

436
00:46:50,810 --> 00:46:53,976
- Yeah.
- I know why.

437
00:46:54,063 --> 00:46:55,605
Yeah?

438
00:46:55,689 --> 00:47:00,350
You wanted the licence number off ofthat car.
I wrote it down in my notebook.

439
00:47:00,444 --> 00:47:03,113
I got it all but the last number.

440
00:47:03,197 --> 00:47:06,447
I'll get it from you later. Can you belch?

441
00:47:06,533 --> 00:47:08,774
Like burp. Can you burp?

442
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:17,666
- That's good. That's very good.
- I just had a Coke.

443
00:47:17,753 --> 00:47:20,125
Listen to me. This famous teacher...

444
00:47:20,214 --> 00:47:24,294
He teaches a lot of rich kids and plays
for the symphonies and all that, right?

445
00:47:24,384 --> 00:47:27,053
Belch every few minutes
while you're practising.

446
00:47:27,137 --> 00:47:31,964
You apologise to him, but you keep belching.
You'll offend every sensibility he has.

447
00:47:32,059 --> 00:47:35,759
Very good. You'll be back in the pool
in 24 hours, I guarantee you.

448
00:47:35,854 --> 00:47:37,930
Right, Sam?

449
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:47,068
- Hola.
- Lupita Ramos.

450
00:47:50,243 --> 00:47:52,401
For you, Creasy.

451
00:47:55,665 --> 00:47:57,538
Thank you.

452
00:48:00,837 --> 00:48:04,170
- How does this look?
- Good. Good.

453
00:48:06,676 --> 00:48:08,419
- Hola, Pita.
- Hola.

454
00:48:08,928 --> 00:48:09,592
Come on in.

455
00:48:09,679 --> 00:48:10,710
Bye.

456
00:48:10,805 --> 00:48:12,881
- How long?
- One hour.

457
00:48:12,974 --> 00:48:14,847
Gracias.

458
00:48:42,753 --> 00:48:44,412
Pita...

459
00:48:52,888 --> 00:48:56,091
!Pita! Porfavor, concéntrate.

460
00:50:18,515 --> 00:50:19,594
Pita!

461
00:50:22,352 --> 00:50:23,217
Pita!

462
00:50:30,485 --> 00:50:32,228
No te vas a callar.

463
00:50:33,321 --> 00:50:35,360
Pita!

464
00:50:44,332 --> 00:50:45,991
Run!

465
00:52:04,703 --> 00:52:07,158
Creasy!

466
00:52:07,247 --> 00:52:09,239
Creasy!

467
00:52:11,376 --> 00:52:13,617
Creasy. Creasy!

468
00:52:14,504 --> 00:52:16,626
Creasy!

469
00:52:29,018 --> 00:52:30,560
I can't...

470
00:52:53,668 --> 00:52:58,376
John W Creasy is under arrest for the murder
oftwo officers ofthe Judicial Police.

471
00:52:58,464 --> 00:53:01,168
Creasy!

472
00:53:09,767 --> 00:53:13,432
This man, John W Creasy,

473
00:53:13,521 --> 00:53:15,145
an American citizen,

474
00:53:15,231 --> 00:53:17,022
is under arrest for the murder

475
00:53:17,274 --> 00:53:19,729
oftwo officers ofthe Judicial Police

476
00:53:22,404 --> 00:53:25,073
and is suspected of possible involvement

477
00:53:25,157 --> 00:53:27,908
in the kidnapping of Lupita Martin Ramos.

478
00:53:30,079 --> 00:53:32,748
Chief Ramirez...

479
00:53:34,917 --> 00:53:37,454
The two officers who were killed.

480
00:53:37,544 --> 00:53:39,916
Records show they were off duty at the time.

481
00:53:40,631 --> 00:53:43,122
So why were they in uniform

482
00:53:43,425 --> 00:53:44,373
and in a patrol car?

483
00:53:44,468 --> 00:53:48,216
All I know is that they died bravely.

484
00:53:49,181 --> 00:53:50,425
Of course,

485
00:53:50,516 --> 00:53:53,220
but what exactly were they doing

486
00:53:53,310 --> 00:53:54,720
at the scene ofthe kidnapping?

487
00:53:55,437 --> 00:53:58,556
Or were they known
for their exceptional good luck?

488
00:53:58,649 --> 00:54:00,641
They were known for being corrupt

489
00:54:00,734 --> 00:54:03,189
and now are celebrated for being dead.

490
00:55:00,168 --> 00:55:02,623
Excuse me.

491
00:55:08,342 --> 00:55:10,500
Relax, OK? Relax, Sammy.

492
00:55:15,975 --> 00:55:19,474
I know she's your little girl. When I
tell you everything's gonna be all right,

493
00:55:19,562 --> 00:55:22,231
everything's gonna be all right.

494
00:55:23,899 --> 00:55:26,271
Señor Ramos.

495
00:55:34,285 --> 00:55:36,858
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

496
00:55:36,954 --> 00:55:40,737
Victor Fuentes, Anti-Kidnapping Division,
Policia Judicial.

497
00:55:40,833 --> 00:55:44,451
Excuse me. I'm Jordan Kalfus.
I'm the family attorney.

498
00:55:44,545 --> 00:55:49,919
Speak slower, please.
My Russian is better than my English.

499
00:55:50,008 --> 00:55:54,835
Well, I'm conducting the negotiations, and we
neither need nor want any police assistance.

500
00:55:54,930 --> 00:55:58,630
We're gonna handle this thing ourselves.

501
00:55:59,393 --> 00:56:05,894
Señor Ramos, two police officers were killed
during your daughter's abduction.

502
00:56:05,983 --> 00:56:08,900
I have a written order from...

503
00:56:09,069 --> 00:56:11,026
the Public Minister...

504
00:56:11,279 --> 00:56:13,271
authorising our participation...

505
00:56:13,365 --> 00:56:15,986
..."unofficially".

506
00:56:17,035 --> 00:56:21,827
Ifyou want to speak to
Attorney General Diaz, it's on me.

507
00:56:23,959 --> 00:56:25,666
OK.

508
00:56:25,752 --> 00:56:30,164
The kidnapper will tell you
to deliver the money alone.

509
00:56:30,882 --> 00:56:32,839
Porfavor, don't do that.

510
00:56:32,926 --> 00:56:38,631
Or you will find yourself in a real
Mexican hell. No mariachi, no tequila...

511
00:56:38,723 --> 00:56:40,799
and no Pita.

512
00:57:20,014 --> 00:57:21,045
Crease?

513
00:57:23,142 --> 00:57:24,173
Crease.

514
00:57:27,063 --> 00:57:30,811
When I heard it was this hospital,
I was so pleased.

515
00:57:30,900 --> 00:57:34,482
There is a pastry shop nearby. Delgado's.

516
00:57:34,570 --> 00:57:38,781
They have the best pastries in Mexico.

517
00:57:38,866 --> 00:57:42,815
Miguel Manzano. Director ofthe AFl.

518
00:57:42,912 --> 00:57:49,032
And a former director of lnterpol, in Rome.

519
00:57:50,169 --> 00:57:53,537
- And you are?
- A friend of his. Rayburn.

520
00:57:53,631 --> 00:57:55,457
Rayburn.

521
00:58:09,313 --> 00:58:10,807
?Hola?

522
00:58:10,939 --> 00:58:13,643
Do you love your daughter, señor Ramos?

523
00:58:13,734 --> 00:58:15,856
Yes. Yes.

524
00:58:15,944 --> 00:58:19,147
- Do you want to see her again?
- Yes, I do.

525
00:58:19,239 --> 00:58:20,567
Señor...

526
00:58:21,575 --> 00:58:26,486
Ifyour daughter's life is
as important to you as it is to me,

527
00:58:26,580 --> 00:58:28,905
you will do as I say.

528
00:58:28,999 --> 00:58:31,038
Yes?

529
00:58:31,126 --> 00:58:32,668
OK, yes.

530
00:58:33,336 --> 00:58:35,458
Crease. You hear me?

531
00:58:38,967 --> 00:58:41,208
You got four of 'em, all dead.

532
00:58:43,013 --> 00:58:46,097
- Pita?
- It's...

533
00:58:47,976 --> 00:58:50,597
It's been two days.

534
00:58:50,687 --> 00:58:53,522
They're negotiating a ransom.

535
00:58:54,983 --> 00:58:58,601
These things take time, Mr Creasy.

536
00:59:03,199 --> 00:59:04,823
Crease.

537
00:59:07,036 --> 00:59:09,953
Don't fuck with me, all right?

538
00:59:15,503 --> 00:59:18,918
You have the ten million?
Do you have the money?

539
00:59:19,006 --> 00:59:22,789
- Yes, we have the money.
- Now, ifyou do as I say,

540
00:59:22,885 --> 00:59:27,262
the girl will be returned
exactly as she was taken.

541
00:59:27,348 --> 00:59:31,476
But ifyou deviate
from the process in any way...

542
00:59:32,061 --> 00:59:34,053
By the Virgin of Guadeloupe,

543
00:59:34,146 --> 00:59:36,637
I swear you will never see her again.

544
00:59:36,732 --> 00:59:39,851
I understand. Listen, I too
worship la Virgen de Guadalupe...

545
00:59:39,944 --> 00:59:41,983
I ask ifyou understand.

546
00:59:44,824 --> 00:59:48,074
Hello, sir. This is Mr Ramos's attorney.

547
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:51,113
He's going through a very difficult time,
but he understands.

548
00:59:51,205 --> 00:59:54,573
Do you understand?
Repeat the drop instructions.

549
00:59:54,667 --> 00:59:59,827
OK, the money, ten million US, will be divided
into two 15-gallon black canvas bags,

550
00:59:59,922 --> 01:00:04,251
each containing five million, which
will be checked at the bank by the KR agent,

551
01:00:04,343 --> 01:00:08,969
then driven to the house in an armoured car,
where it will be transferred to the delivery car.

552
01:00:09,807 --> 01:00:12,594
You got a flat tyre here.

553
01:00:12,684 --> 01:00:14,760
This is for you.

554
01:00:15,854 --> 01:00:18,226
Hello. Yeah.

555
01:00:18,315 --> 01:00:20,888
Listen, I need a driver to drive Samuel.

556
01:00:20,984 --> 01:00:23,225
No. Why?

557
01:00:23,320 --> 01:00:27,151
He's got a bad ticker.
He's got a heart condition.

558
01:00:27,240 --> 01:00:30,443
Look, he's a nervous kid.
He doesn't respond well to stress.

559
01:00:32,579 --> 01:00:37,240
All right, but the car will not be powerful.

560
01:00:37,334 --> 01:00:42,410
Remove the trunk lid.
Use the maid's Valiant Acapulco.

561
01:00:43,173 --> 01:00:47,004
You will arrive at La Diana fountain at 1am.

562
01:00:47,093 --> 01:00:51,256
You will drive around the circle two times.

563
01:00:51,348 --> 01:00:56,259
Samuel will remove his shirt
and hold it out the window to ID the car.

564
01:00:56,353 --> 01:00:59,306
to ID the car.

565
01:01:00,398 --> 01:01:04,146
There is a payphone on the southeast corner.

566
01:01:04,235 --> 01:01:10,070
The phone will ring.
You will answer and wait for instructions.

567
01:01:10,158 --> 01:01:15,069
There is a map on the top
ofthe phone. Follow it.

568
01:01:17,081 --> 01:01:18,990
Perfecto.

569
01:01:19,083 --> 01:01:21,574
Tranquilo. Si.

570
01:01:23,004 --> 01:01:26,004
- What are you doing? He said no phones.
- Relax, relax.

571
01:01:26,090 --> 01:01:29,921
I'm just trying to protect your daughter, OK?

572
01:01:34,849 --> 01:01:36,011
What's goin' on?

573
01:01:36,350 --> 01:01:39,185
Hospitals can be very dangerous places,

574
01:01:39,270 --> 01:01:43,219
especially when you have
killed two corrupt cops.

575
01:01:55,619 --> 01:01:59,568
Leave the money in the trunk ofthe white car

576
01:01:59,665 --> 01:02:01,741
and return to your car.

577
01:02:03,544 --> 01:02:06,877
Do not look back.

578
01:02:15,723 --> 01:02:17,382
What's going on, guys?

579
01:02:17,474 --> 01:02:19,051
Ambush!

580
01:02:25,149 --> 01:02:28,980
Remember... I'm a professional.

581
01:02:29,278 --> 01:02:36,905
Ifyou keep your word, I will keep mine.

582
01:02:46,253 --> 01:02:48,411
- Hello?
- Mr Ramos.

583
01:02:48,505 --> 01:02:52,039
You betrayed me. You killed my nephew.

584
01:02:52,676 --> 01:02:54,300
You took my money.

585
01:02:54,386 --> 01:02:56,378
Señor Ramos...

586
01:02:56,555 --> 01:02:59,425
God be with your child.

587
01:03:01,351 --> 01:03:06,226
All right. Get outta here, all ofyou.
Get the fuck out of my house!

588
01:03:06,314 --> 01:03:08,602
OK, this is Lisa...

589
01:03:09,484 --> 01:03:12,271
Martin Ramos. I'm Pita's mother.

590
01:03:13,780 --> 01:03:18,655
And I'm very sorry for whatever happened
to your nephew, but I beg you...

591
01:03:18,743 --> 01:03:21,827
Please don't harm my daughter.

592
01:03:23,540 --> 01:03:26,410
This conversation is not being recorded.

593
01:03:26,501 --> 01:03:28,873
You're negotiating directly with me.

594
01:03:28,962 --> 01:03:34,585
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.
I wish we had talked sooner, señora.

595
01:03:34,676 --> 01:03:37,380
I'm really sorry.

596
01:03:38,096 --> 01:03:40,172
Now it is too late.

597
01:03:49,899 --> 01:03:54,477
Fuck off! Get the fuck out
of my fucking house! Now!

598
01:03:55,529 --> 01:03:58,280
Get out! Get out!

599
01:04:46,666 --> 01:04:49,619
Hey, Ray. How are you...?

600
01:04:51,963 --> 01:04:55,746
- Where am l?
- Well, it looks like a dog hospital.

601
01:05:00,096 --> 01:05:03,630
Manzano was afraid
the cops were gonna kill ya.

602
01:05:04,684 --> 01:05:06,760
How you doin', doc?

603
01:05:11,816 --> 01:05:13,892
What's the matter?

604
01:05:17,113 --> 01:05:19,401
She's dead, Crease.

605
01:05:21,743 --> 01:05:26,451
It's a mess. Somebody
hijacked the drop and...

606
01:05:30,293 --> 01:05:34,789
The kidnapper's nephew was killed,
so he killed Pita.

607
01:05:47,226 --> 01:05:50,844
He has gunshot wounds
to the chest and the abdomen.

608
01:05:51,230 --> 01:05:53,222
He has a collapsed lung
which we've re-inflated.

609
01:05:53,316 --> 01:05:57,527
He's lucky to be alive.
If he doesn't rest, he will die.

610
01:06:00,281 --> 01:06:01,858
How long will he be hospitalised?

611
01:06:01,949 --> 01:06:03,858
Approximately a month.

612
01:06:06,370 --> 01:06:08,279
No.

613
01:06:16,130 --> 01:06:18,003
No.

614
01:06:23,053 --> 01:06:26,256
Did you recognise any ofthese men?

615
01:06:27,474 --> 01:06:32,017
No. Does that make me a suspect?

616
01:06:32,771 --> 01:06:34,728
No.

617
01:06:34,815 --> 01:06:36,891
It would be convenient, but no.

618
01:06:38,193 --> 01:06:42,273
Maybe you should show me pictures of some
Mexican cops. Maybe we'll get somewhere.

619
01:06:42,364 --> 01:06:44,771
Those were all policemen.

620
01:06:44,866 --> 01:06:47,950
Bad Judicial cops,

621
01:06:48,036 --> 01:06:52,365
protected, by a brotherhood.

622
01:06:52,457 --> 01:06:54,366
A brotherhood?

623
01:06:55,961 --> 01:06:59,709
A brotherhood, called...

624
01:07:15,688 --> 01:07:18,309
You all set?

625
01:07:18,399 --> 01:07:20,058
- Right arm.
- Yeah.

626
01:07:23,154 --> 01:07:25,645
- You OK?
- Yeah, I'm all right.

627
01:07:25,740 --> 01:07:27,862
Let's go.

628
01:08:04,528 --> 01:08:06,686
- Somebody's on us.
- Yeah.

629
01:08:07,656 --> 01:08:09,315
Lois Lane.

630
01:08:10,076 --> 01:08:13,326
Mariana something, works for Reforma.

631
01:08:13,954 --> 01:08:16,658
Newspaperjournalist.

632
01:08:16,749 --> 01:08:19,999
I guess she thinks you're a scoop.

633
01:08:21,712 --> 01:08:23,336
I'll get you up to the border.

634
01:08:23,422 --> 01:08:26,873
A friend will take you to San Diego,
drop you at the Naval Hospital.

635
01:08:26,967 --> 01:08:29,374
I'm not goin', Ray.

636
01:08:29,470 --> 01:08:31,961
What are you gonna do?

637
01:08:32,056 --> 01:08:35,721
Let's take a ride by the crime scene.
She can follow us.

638
01:08:44,860 --> 01:08:46,936
Buenos dias.

639
01:09:46,921 --> 01:09:49,246
Mr Creasy?

640
01:09:49,340 --> 01:09:52,091
A lot of people are looking for you.

641
01:09:53,177 --> 01:09:55,750
I'm Mariana Garcia Guerrero.

642
01:09:56,597 --> 01:09:59,052
Reporter, for Reforma.

643
01:10:01,727 --> 01:10:04,099
Nice to meet you.

644
01:10:04,188 --> 01:10:06,145
I found this across the street.

645
01:10:09,819 --> 01:10:11,443
Open it.

646
01:10:15,116 --> 01:10:17,820
It's Santa Muerte. Death worship.

647
01:10:21,789 --> 01:10:25,323
- They've put a curse on you.
- A little late.

648
01:10:29,338 --> 01:10:33,667
- What are you going to do?
- I'm gonna get in my truck and leave.

649
01:10:36,845 --> 01:10:39,217
I can help you.

650
01:10:41,100 --> 01:10:45,311
There's a brotherhood called La Hermandad.

651
01:10:45,396 --> 01:10:49,263
It protects government officials,
corrupt police and organised crime

652
01:10:49,358 --> 01:10:53,854
at a level that is too difficult for me to reach.

653
01:10:53,946 --> 01:10:55,488
OK.

654
01:10:55,572 --> 01:11:01,277
And I think that you and Lupita Ramos
are victims ofthis organisation.

655
01:11:01,370 --> 01:11:07,906
I want to expose them. Talk to me, give me
your story, and then I can help you. Please.

656
01:11:12,464 --> 01:11:14,752
Help me do what?

657
01:11:15,717 --> 01:11:18,836
You're gonna help me do what?

658
01:11:19,679 --> 01:11:23,213
- You're a stranger here, no?
- That's right.

659
01:11:23,308 --> 01:11:27,685
You're going to need friends
that know their way around.

660
01:11:27,771 --> 01:11:29,847
OK.

661
01:11:29,939 --> 01:11:32,476
OK, friend that's gonna help me.

662
01:11:34,861 --> 01:11:36,983
Pleasure to meet you.

663
01:11:37,072 --> 01:11:41,532
Tell your driver to keep his distance
next time. All right, friend?

664
01:11:44,787 --> 01:11:46,779
Si.

665
01:12:03,347 --> 01:12:07,807
- You'll be Stateside by supper time.
- I'm gonna need some help first, though.

666
01:12:07,894 --> 01:12:10,978
You don't stop bleeding,
you won't last a day in your shape.

667
01:12:11,063 --> 01:12:15,191
- Is that a yes or is that a no?
- Yeah! But...

668
01:12:15,276 --> 01:12:17,398
- I'm done killing. I told you that.
- OK.

669
01:12:17,486 --> 01:12:19,443
Anything else is yours.

670
01:12:25,870 --> 01:12:30,448
- You're talkin' about war, Crease.
- Exactly. Can you help me?

671
01:12:33,335 --> 01:12:35,208
- Yeah.
- Good.

672
01:13:50,078 --> 01:13:52,154
Creasy?

673
01:14:46,592 --> 01:14:49,165
What are you doin' here?

674
01:14:56,685 --> 01:14:59,092
I came to get my stuff.

675
01:14:59,188 --> 01:15:02,639
Couldn't find my Bible.
I thought it might be in here.

676
01:15:02,733 --> 01:15:06,267
- I borrowed it.
- OK.

677
01:15:07,780 --> 01:15:09,737
It's crazy, huh?

678
01:15:10,657 --> 01:15:15,200
One week we're figuring out which
nightclub to go to, and the next thing I'm...

679
01:15:15,287 --> 01:15:17,409
readin' the Bible.

680
01:15:17,497 --> 01:15:20,166
It's a good thing. You hold on to it.

681
01:15:24,713 --> 01:15:29,540
I keep thinkin' if only we hadn't...

682
01:15:32,471 --> 01:15:34,547
It's like...

683
01:15:36,683 --> 01:15:43,136
My whole life all I've ever thought about
was what I could get for myself.

684
01:15:43,231 --> 01:15:46,148
Not my own baby.

685
01:15:48,528 --> 01:15:56,108
She needed me so much, and sometimes
I felt like I had nothin' to give her.

686
01:15:56,202 --> 01:15:59,202
Just... I don't know what to do.

687
01:16:01,791 --> 01:16:05,373
- What are you gonna do?
- What I do best.

688
01:16:05,461 --> 01:16:07,537
I'm gonna kill 'em.

689
01:16:08,548 --> 01:16:15,261
Anyone that was involved, who profited
from it, anybody who opens their eyes at me.

690
01:16:15,346 --> 01:16:17,255
You kill 'em all.

691
01:16:46,502 --> 01:16:48,578
Yla Browning.

692
01:17:20,494 --> 01:17:22,285

693
01:17:22,371 --> 01:17:28,409

01:17:28,502 --> 01:17:30,660

- Yeah, it's me.

696
01:17:35,300 --> 01:17:39,083
- Mr Creasy.
- I need the licence... No, excuse me.

697
01:17:39,179 --> 01:17:44,255
I need the name and address of someone
whose licence number is C5TK8.

698
01:17:44,351 --> 01:17:48,182
That's C5TK8.

699
01:17:48,271 --> 01:17:52,351
I got everything but the last digit,
so I need ten possible matches.

700
01:17:52,442 --> 01:17:54,767
And when do I find out which ofthe ten it is?

701
01:17:54,861 --> 01:17:57,648
- Eventually.
- But where do I reach you?

702
01:17:57,739 --> 01:17:59,815
I'll call you.

703
01:18:05,205 --> 01:18:10,032
AGENCY FOR FEDERAL INVESTIGATION
MEXICO CITY

704
01:18:10,919 --> 01:18:12,461
Do you know who he is?

705
01:18:12,545 --> 01:18:15,415
Do you know what he's been doing
the last 16 years?

706
01:18:16,257 --> 01:18:17,834
Counter-insurgency work in Thailand,

Jordan, Angola, Lebanon.
Yes, I know all ofthat.

709
01:18:22,013 --> 01:18:23,293
He's an assassin...

710
01:18:23,389 --> 01:18:27,600
and you want to help him identify
the owner of a car for him?

711
01:18:28,227 --> 01:18:31,560
He can go places we can't.

712
01:18:32,607 --> 01:18:35,524
Ifyou don't want to use him... I will.

713
01:18:38,154 --> 01:18:40,395
- Mariana...
- ?Si?

714
01:18:40,490 --> 01:18:42,778
When do I get to sleep with you again?

715
01:18:42,867 --> 01:18:44,444
We never sleep. We fuck.

716
01:18:44,535 --> 01:18:46,242
Give it to me.

717
01:18:47,246 --> 01:18:49,404
Give it to me.

718
01:18:49,498 --> 01:18:51,870
Gracias.

719
01:18:53,711 --> 01:18:55,288
Ciao.

720
01:19:28,871 --> 01:19:29,902
Maneja.

721
01:19:29,997 --> 01:19:31,740
Jorge Gonzàlez.

722
01:19:33,333 --> 01:19:34,957
I'm a Judicial Policeman.

723
01:19:35,419 --> 01:19:38,503
Drive.

724
01:19:38,589 --> 01:19:40,961
OK. Maneja.

725
01:20:06,074 --> 01:20:08,362
What are you gonna do?

726
01:20:08,451 --> 01:20:10,858
What I do best.

727
01:20:12,580 --> 01:20:16,743
Anyone that was involved, who profited
from it, anybody who opens their eyes at me.

728
01:20:16,835 --> 01:20:18,911
I'm gonna kill 'em.

729
01:21:02,588 --> 01:21:03,536
Can you hear me?

730
01:21:03,881 --> 01:21:04,995
My head hurts.

731
01:21:09,011 --> 01:21:10,802
I am going to ask questions.

732
01:21:13,349 --> 01:21:15,388
Ifyou don't answer fully and truthfully,

733
01:21:15,476 --> 01:21:17,883
you will suffer much more than you have to.

734
01:21:18,604 --> 01:21:20,976
I'm going to cut your fingers off.

735
01:21:26,820 --> 01:21:29,524
One by one, if I have to.

736
01:21:30,574 --> 01:21:32,732
This is to stop the bleeding.

737
01:21:34,078 --> 01:21:36,200
OK? Ahora.

738
01:21:36,288 --> 01:21:38,613
Don't mess with me.

739
01:21:38,707 --> 01:21:40,913
?Sabes quién soyyo?

740
01:21:41,001 --> 01:21:43,788
You know who I am?

741
01:21:45,214 --> 01:21:47,787
A member of La Hermandad.

742
01:21:49,051 --> 01:21:51,802
- ?Correcto?
- Correct.

743
01:21:52,304 --> 01:21:53,584
OK.

744
01:22:03,565 --> 01:22:07,693
!No mames!
!No me quemes, pendejo de mierda!

745
01:22:07,777 --> 01:22:08,939
!Suelta!

746
01:22:16,953 --> 01:22:21,531
- Chinga a tu madre, pinche pendejo.
- Yeah. Ytù. Ytù.

747
01:22:25,003 --> 01:22:30,245
What do you want to know?

748
01:22:31,092 --> 01:22:32,467
The Ramos kidnapping...

749
01:22:34,262 --> 01:22:37,713
What went wrong at the drop?

750
01:22:39,142 --> 01:22:40,968
No sé nada.

751
01:22:41,060 --> 01:22:43,847
We were just ordered to take her.

752
01:22:44,605 --> 01:22:46,431
That's all we did.

753
01:22:47,525 --> 01:22:48,438
Ordered by who?

754
01:22:48,776 --> 01:22:50,056
I don't know.

755
01:22:50,403 --> 01:22:52,728
You don't know?

756
01:22:52,822 --> 01:22:56,072
!No sé!!No sé!

757
01:22:58,369 --> 01:22:59,649
!No sé!!No sé!

758
01:22:59,745 --> 01:23:01,073
We work in separate groups.

759
01:23:01,164 --> 01:23:02,243
A voice calls.

760
01:23:02,331 --> 01:23:03,445
We grab the target

761
01:23:03,541 --> 01:23:06,625
and deliver it to the guardians.

762
01:23:10,423 --> 01:23:12,166
The bosses never see the target,

763
01:23:12,508 --> 01:23:14,085
theyjust make the deal.

764
01:23:14,176 --> 01:23:16,334
!Eso es todo!

765
01:23:16,429 --> 01:23:18,717
Who ordered it?

766
01:23:23,727 --> 01:23:24,806
We call him "The Voice".

767
01:23:25,354 --> 01:23:26,896
"The Voice." OK.

768
01:23:27,481 --> 01:23:28,643
"The Voice", si.

769
01:23:30,025 --> 01:23:31,400
The Voice.

770
01:23:32,987 --> 01:23:34,315
The Voice. How do I find him?

771
01:23:40,744 --> 01:23:42,866
You don't know?

772
01:23:43,956 --> 01:23:45,829
Are you sure?

773
01:23:52,047 --> 01:23:53,838
OK.

774
01:23:54,883 --> 01:23:56,959
OK.

775
01:23:59,137 --> 01:24:02,340
I believe you.

776
01:24:14,152 --> 01:24:15,895
Tell me about the guardians.

777
01:24:20,033 --> 01:24:21,692
I'm a professional.

778
01:24:22,911 --> 01:24:25,580
I'm a professional. I just do myjob.

779
01:24:28,750 --> 01:24:31,916
Tell me about the guardians.

780
01:24:35,131 --> 01:24:38,131
- Guardianes.
- Guardianes, OK. Guardianes.

781
01:24:42,597 --> 01:24:44,091
You don't know?

782
01:24:44,182 --> 01:24:46,258
I don't know.

783
01:24:49,312 --> 01:24:51,470
!No me mates, cabron!

784
01:24:51,564 --> 01:24:54,434
!Ya déjame en paz, cabron!

785
01:24:59,364 --> 01:25:01,855
He works the door at a rave in Neza.

786
01:25:01,949 --> 01:25:02,980
He has a mark

787
01:25:03,076 --> 01:25:05,033
on the left side of his face.

788
01:25:05,119 --> 01:25:07,491
They call him "The Butcher".

789
01:25:08,706 --> 01:25:09,785
Is he La Hermandad?

790
01:25:10,208 --> 01:25:12,496
Yes, La Hermandad.

791
01:25:15,796 --> 01:25:17,124
OK.

792
01:25:17,214 --> 01:25:19,787
Wait, wait, wait.

793
01:25:21,010 --> 01:25:23,132
Give me one cigarette, please, eh?

794
01:25:23,220 --> 01:25:25,545
Si.

795
01:25:26,599 --> 01:25:28,887
OK.

796
01:25:30,895 --> 01:25:33,101
?Bueno?

797
01:25:34,690 --> 01:25:36,184
OK, my friend.

798
01:25:37,359 --> 01:25:40,146
It's offto the next life for you.

799
01:25:41,530 --> 01:25:44,649
I guarantee you won't be lonely.

800
01:26:08,640 --> 01:26:12,471
Revenge is a meal best served cold.

801
01:26:58,690 --> 01:27:01,525
The Rave - Neza

802
01:27:48,155 --> 01:27:50,313
Tell me about the girl.

803
01:27:50,407 --> 01:27:51,651
I don't know her.

804
01:27:51,742 --> 01:27:53,864
- !La niña!
- No.

805
01:27:55,371 --> 01:27:56,200
!Vamos!

806
01:28:29,613 --> 01:28:30,811
?Qué hay?

807
01:28:40,498 --> 01:28:42,989
OK, OK. Don't shoot. Don't shoot.

808
01:28:47,756 --> 01:28:49,380
Tell me about the girl.

809
01:28:54,429 --> 01:28:55,424
Do you know her?

810
01:28:59,601 --> 01:29:01,344
No?

811
01:29:16,117 --> 01:29:20,410
Hey, man, I heard you speaking Spanish
over there. You're American, right?

812
01:29:20,496 --> 01:29:22,369
- And so are you.

All right, listen to me.

01:29:28,921 --> 01:29:31,874
Tell me how it works. The whole thing.
Tell me how it works.

817
01:29:31,966 --> 01:29:34,503
All right, everything is done by cellphone.

818
01:29:34,594 --> 01:29:38,093
You just wait around for calls.
We don't even have a fuckin' number.

819
01:29:38,180 --> 01:29:40,256
- Who pays you?
- We got an ATM card.

820
01:29:40,349 --> 01:29:45,425
We take out 200 fuckin' measly dollars
every two weeks.

821
01:29:47,106 --> 01:29:48,434

01:29:57,158 --> 01:29:58,320
- Yeah.

825
01:29:58,409 --> 01:30:00,282
- You wouldn't lie to me?
- I'm not lyin'.

826
01:30:00,369 --> 01:30:02,408
- You didn't kill her, did you?
- No.

827
01:30:05,958 --> 01:30:06,953
Don't lie to me!

828
01:30:07,042 --> 01:30:10,991
- Don't lie to me! Did you kill her?
- You're makin' me fuckin' nervous.

829
01:30:11,088 --> 01:30:14,005
- Did you kill her?
- No! The fuckin' boss did, or his brother.

830
01:30:14,133 --> 01:30:16,209
Who's the boss?

831
01:30:16,969 --> 01:30:19,424
- We never see his face.

01:30:20,222 --> 01:30:21,764
I'm tellin' you the truth!

Who? You never seen whose face?

834
01:30:23,559 --> 01:30:25,966
Well, we were in the other room.

835
01:30:26,895 --> 01:30:32,684
And he was yellin' at the girl cos his nephew
got killed and the money got stolen.

836
01:30:32,776 --> 01:30:36,394
- Wait. Somebody stole what money?
- The ransom money at the drop.

837
01:30:36,488 --> 01:30:39,405
- Who stole it?
- He said some fuckin' crooked cop took it.

838
01:30:39,491 --> 01:30:41,198

01:30:41,284 --> 01:30:43,406

842
01:30:52,504 --> 01:30:54,247
- This Fuentes guy...

843
01:30:55,298 --> 01:30:57,705
He's a lieutenant
for the Anti-Kidnapping Division.

844
01:30:57,801 --> 01:30:58,749
- Fuentes is?
- Yeah.

845
01:30:58,843 --> 01:31:01,298

01:31:01,388 --> 01:31:04,388
Tell me about the girl. What did you do?

847
01:31:04,474 --> 01:31:07,143
- I just do what they tell me.
- You do what they tell you to do?

848
01:31:07,227 --> 01:31:10,227
Did you say goodbye to her?
Answer. Did you say goodbye to her?

849
01:31:10,313 --> 01:31:11,807

- You didn't?

850
01:31:11,898 --> 01:31:14,139
- Here's your chance. Say goodbye.
- Oh, shit.

851
01:31:14,234 --> 01:31:17,104
Say goodbye to her. Say goodbye to her.

852
01:31:17,195 --> 01:31:19,152
Motherfucker, let me go!

853
01:31:22,075 --> 01:31:23,450
?Hijo?

854
01:31:39,717 --> 01:31:41,958
They threw the little girl against the wall.

855
01:31:42,053 --> 01:31:46,346
She wasn't moving.

856
01:31:47,516 --> 01:31:50,931
They threw her body in the trunk ofthe car,

857
01:31:52,104 --> 01:31:54,226
and then they drove away.

858
01:31:54,315 --> 01:31:57,150
Who? Who? Who's they?

859
01:31:58,527 --> 01:32:00,186
The boss's brother.

860
01:32:01,781 --> 01:32:04,069
I recognised his voice.

861
01:32:04,617 --> 01:32:06,905
OK. OK.

862
01:32:10,247 --> 01:32:11,445
Now listen to me.

863
01:32:11,540 --> 01:32:14,825
Ifyou tell me where to find the boss,

864
01:32:17,504 --> 01:32:18,879
I'll let you live.

865
01:32:20,674 --> 01:32:22,750
But I don't know.

866
01:32:26,847 --> 01:32:28,590
I'll give you the girl.

867
01:32:30,309 --> 01:32:32,135
I'll give you the girl.

868
01:32:33,187 --> 01:32:34,385
What girl?

869
01:32:34,897 --> 01:32:35,643
The girl...

870
01:32:36,231 --> 01:32:38,057
Do you want the girl?

871
01:32:38,734 --> 01:32:41,984
Yes, yes, but what girl?
What are you saying?

872
01:32:42,070 --> 01:32:43,528
- The girl.
- Here?

873
01:32:43,613 --> 01:32:44,526
Si.

874
01:32:47,325 --> 01:32:48,154
You sure?

875
01:32:48,243 --> 01:32:49,441
Si.

876
01:32:51,663 --> 01:32:53,073
Show me.

877
01:34:25,589 --> 01:34:27,747
- Si. Guerrero.
- Listen, it's me.

878
01:34:27,841 --> 01:34:32,004
Do you know about a young girl being
kidnapped recently, about 12 years old?

879
01:34:32,096 --> 01:34:36,093
- Yes, last night. Do you know something?
- What's her name?

880
01:34:36,183 --> 01:34:38,175
Camila. Camila Valencias.

881
01:34:39,311 --> 01:34:42,477
- ?Camila? ?Se llama Camila?
- Si.

882
01:34:42,564 --> 01:34:44,971
- I got her.
- Where are you?

883
01:35:15,263 --> 01:35:19,759
- Creasy, what happened?
- It's OK. Sit down, relax.

884
01:35:19,851 --> 01:35:22,638
- Camila, ?estàs bien?
- She's OK, she's OK.

885
01:35:22,729 --> 01:35:25,302
You got banking connections?

886
01:35:25,398 --> 01:35:27,390
Yes, I have connections.

887
01:35:30,069 --> 01:35:35,904
PIN number's 4747. I wanna find out
who's puttin' money in that account.

888
01:35:35,992 --> 01:35:38,317
4747.

889
01:35:40,288 --> 01:35:42,529
What do you know
about a cop named Fuentes?

890
01:35:42,624 --> 01:35:47,001
He's with the Anti-Kidnapping Division.
He drove Samuel Ramos to the drop.

891
01:35:47,086 --> 01:35:50,252
- Fuentes?
- Who is she?

892
01:35:50,339 --> 01:35:52,746
You can ask her later.
She'll tell you anything.

893
01:35:52,842 --> 01:35:55,379
What do you know about Fuentes?

894
01:35:55,470 --> 01:35:59,633
Three years ago they caught him with $50,000
and a dead body in the trunk of his car.

895
01:35:59,724 --> 01:36:05,596
Never charged. The arresting officer
couldn't testify cos he was dead.

896
01:36:05,688 --> 01:36:07,929
Was he La Hermandad?

897
01:36:08,024 --> 01:36:13,398
- You know where he lives?
- He lives in a Judicial compound.

898
01:36:13,487 --> 01:36:16,440
He travels by motorcade.

899
01:36:19,243 --> 01:36:21,912
He's better protected
than the president of Mexico.

900
01:36:21,996 --> 01:36:24,202
He's gonna need it.
Can you take care of her?

901
01:36:24,290 --> 01:36:27,207
- Yes, but how can I find you?
- I'll find you.

902
01:36:54,903 --> 01:36:57,061
This is myjurisdiction.

903
01:36:58,824 --> 01:37:02,239
I want this man as much as Creasy does.

904
01:37:03,370 --> 01:37:07,996
He'll deliver more justice in a weekend
than ten years ofyour courts and tribunals.

905
01:37:08,083 --> 01:37:10,241
Just stay out of his way.

906
01:37:10,335 --> 01:37:11,994
I plan to.

907
01:37:19,553 --> 01:37:22,044
I will even help him, if I can.

908
01:37:23,265 --> 01:37:27,179
But... I'd like to understand him.

909
01:37:29,688 --> 01:37:31,929
Give me that.

910
01:37:32,023 --> 01:37:34,099
Pita Ramos...

911
01:37:35,610 --> 01:37:37,982
is a number to you.

912
01:37:38,071 --> 01:37:41,938
One more dead, but a number.

913
01:37:42,742 --> 01:37:47,569
- What was she to Creasy, then?
- She showed him it was all right to live again.

914
01:37:50,541 --> 01:37:53,874
And the kidnappers took that away, huh?

915
01:37:54,837 --> 01:38:00,341
And they're gonna wish
they never touched a hair on her head.

916
01:38:00,927 --> 01:38:03,631
A man can be an artist...

917
01:38:06,474 --> 01:38:09,225
at anything - food, whatever.

918
01:38:09,310 --> 01:38:13,853
It depends on how good he is at it.

919
01:38:16,943 --> 01:38:19,019
Creasy's art is death.

920
01:38:21,781 --> 01:38:24,781
He's about to paint his masterpiece.

921
01:38:32,875 --> 01:38:35,792
I don't have anything else to say.

922
01:39:01,403 --> 01:39:05,946
I need the accounts linked to this card.

923
01:39:11,038 --> 01:39:15,949
PIN number is 4747.

924
01:39:16,668 --> 01:39:20,119
On one condition.

925
01:40:05,425 --> 01:40:09,208
I'm not here to hurt you.

926
01:40:22,859 --> 01:40:25,350
In the church, they say to forgive.

927
01:40:25,444 --> 01:40:27,816
Forgiveness is between them and God.

928
01:40:27,905 --> 01:40:30,822
It's myjob to arrange the meeting.

929
01:42:28,065 --> 01:42:29,856
Don't move. Put your hands down.

930
01:42:39,785 --> 01:42:42,192
Señor John W Creasy is under arrest

931
01:42:42,288 --> 01:42:45,075
for the murder oftwo officers
ofthe Judicial Police...

932
01:42:45,166 --> 01:42:48,285
Creasy!

933
01:42:48,377 --> 01:42:50,001
Creasy!

934
01:43:23,579 --> 01:43:25,951
Can you hear me? Huh?

935
01:43:27,874 --> 01:43:30,032
You know where we are?

936
01:43:31,128 --> 01:43:33,453
We're under the bridge

937
01:43:33,547 --> 01:43:38,458
where the deal went bad
and the ransom got stolen.

938
01:43:38,552 --> 01:43:40,509
You wanna tell me what happened?

939
01:43:40,595 --> 01:43:43,132
- You've heard of La Hermandad?
- Yes, I have.

940
01:43:43,223 --> 01:43:45,299
- You know what it is?
- Yes.

941
01:43:45,433 --> 01:43:47,721
I'm the president of La Hermandad.

942
01:43:47,811 --> 01:43:49,186
- You're the president?
- Yes.

943
01:43:49,271 --> 01:43:51,512
The president? Wow.

944
01:43:52,732 --> 01:43:54,808
Look at me.

945
01:43:54,901 --> 01:43:58,352
Oh, you can't. I'm sorry. How's that?

946
01:44:08,415 --> 01:44:10,656
I'll show you what I got here.

947
01:44:10,750 --> 01:44:13,122
See this? This is a charger.

948
01:44:13,211 --> 01:44:16,128
It's used by convicts
to hide money and drugs.

949
01:44:16,214 --> 01:44:21,125
They stick it in their body, they tuck it
up their rectum. You familiar with that?

950
01:44:21,219 --> 01:44:24,136
This... Look at me. Pencil detonator.

951
01:44:24,222 --> 01:44:28,350
Timer. Used as a receiver, a transmitter.

952
01:44:29,394 --> 01:44:32,430
C4. Highly explosive.

953
01:44:32,522 --> 01:44:34,763
You put 'em all together, you got a bomb.

954
01:44:34,857 --> 01:44:39,353
Not very sophisticated, but very powerful.

955
01:44:39,445 --> 01:44:42,232
That's what you have in your ass right now.

956
01:44:42,323 --> 01:44:44,529
Don't move. Don't move.

957
01:44:44,617 --> 01:44:45,779
Don't move.

958
01:44:49,997 --> 01:44:52,203
Cheap watch, pager watch,

959
01:44:52,291 --> 01:44:58,376
used to send a page to the receiver
that's up your behind right now.

960
01:44:58,464 --> 01:44:59,626
So...

961
01:44:59,715 --> 01:45:03,582
I'm gonna send you a page
which you will receive...

962
01:45:05,596 --> 01:45:08,217
in five minutes.

963
01:45:09,850 --> 01:45:11,593
Now...

964
01:45:15,898 --> 01:45:18,815
You got less than five minutes
to tell me what went down

965
01:45:18,901 --> 01:45:21,226
between your men and the kidnapper.

966
01:45:21,320 --> 01:45:23,561
I have nothing to do with the kidnapper.

967
01:45:23,655 --> 01:45:26,858
- Four minutes and 30 seconds.
- Nothing. I don't know him.

968
01:45:26,950 --> 01:45:30,532
You don't know?
Four minutes and 25 seconds.

969
01:45:32,623 --> 01:45:36,537
Four minutes and 20 seconds. Are you sure?

970
01:45:37,544 --> 01:45:39,287
OK.

971
01:45:40,339 --> 01:45:43,672
I got all the time in the world.
You don't, but I do.

972
01:45:43,759 --> 01:45:46,546
- Relax, relax, buddy.
- I'm relaxed.

973
01:45:46,636 --> 01:45:49,091
You got three minutes, 59 seconds.

974
01:45:49,181 --> 01:45:54,008
- I saw the opportunity, and I got lucky.
- And?

975
01:45:54,102 --> 01:45:57,186
And I had my men ready,
as we got instructions where to go.

976
01:45:57,272 --> 01:46:01,649
You had your men ready to steal the drop,
ready to kill one ofthe kidnappers, yeah?

977
01:46:01,735 --> 01:46:02,730
You've done this many times.

978
01:46:03,153 --> 01:46:03,852
What's going on, guys?

979
01:46:06,281 --> 01:46:09,614
- One ofthe nephews ofthe head kidnapper.
- Bingo, bingo, yeah.

980
01:46:09,701 --> 01:46:11,693
You've done this many times.

981
01:46:11,786 --> 01:46:12,781
Many times, yes.

982
01:46:12,871 --> 01:46:16,204
Yeah. You've killed
many victims too, haven't you?

983
01:46:16,291 --> 01:46:20,454
- We just make out as best we can.
- "As best we could"?

984
01:46:22,172 --> 01:46:24,330
Two minutes, 47 seconds.

985
01:46:26,885 --> 01:46:29,091
Wait a minute.

986
01:46:29,178 --> 01:46:32,428
- Come on, I have a little gift for you.
- For me?

987
01:46:32,515 --> 01:46:35,800
- Yeah, come on.
- What have you got?

988
01:46:35,893 --> 01:46:39,676
There was no $10 million.
There was two and a half in the bags.

989
01:46:39,772 --> 01:46:43,686
The ransom was $10 million.
They put it in two bags, 5 million in each bag.

990
01:46:43,776 --> 01:46:48,105
Two bags, true, but one has half paper,

991
01:46:48,197 --> 01:46:50,652
the other only paper.

992
01:46:51,701 --> 01:46:53,942
Maybe your men stole it.

993
01:46:54,036 --> 01:46:58,247
No, no. Whoever did it
took it before the exchange.

994
01:47:00,251 --> 01:47:01,709
OK.

995
01:47:01,794 --> 01:47:05,376
At the Ramos house, before the exchange,

996
01:47:05,464 --> 01:47:08,381
who put the bags into the car?

997
01:47:08,467 --> 01:47:10,424
- Guess what.
- What?

998
01:47:10,511 --> 01:47:13,714
Ramos' lawyer. Jordan Kalfus.

999
01:47:31,281 --> 01:47:34,032
I'm sorry, I'm really sorry for the girl.

1000
01:47:34,118 --> 01:47:35,991
It was just business, you know?

1001
01:47:41,583 --> 01:47:44,204
Everybody keeps saying that to me.

1002
01:47:44,294 --> 01:47:48,872
I'm getting sick and tired of hearing it.
Do you understand me?

1003
01:47:51,677 --> 01:47:53,918
What are you going to do now?

1004
01:47:54,012 --> 01:47:56,088
What am I gonna do? Leave. I gotta go.

1005
01:47:56,181 --> 01:47:59,347
Go? Hey, come on, come on.
What about me?

1006
01:47:59,434 --> 01:48:01,889
What about you? You got 40 seconds.

1007
01:48:01,978 --> 01:48:03,520
- Come on.
- 35!

1008
01:48:03,605 --> 01:48:06,178
Give me a last wish, please, please.

1009
01:48:06,274 --> 01:48:09,144
Last wish? I wish...

1010
01:48:09,236 --> 01:48:12,272
you had more time.

1011
01:49:02,079 --> 01:49:05,613
JORDAN KALFUS RESIDENCE

1012
01:50:21,408 --> 01:50:22,688
?Hola?

1013
01:50:22,784 --> 01:50:25,535
- Mariana, it's me.
- Creasy, where are you?

1014
01:50:25,620 --> 01:50:29,617
I got something like banking codes
from Bankcoast in the Cayman lslands.

1015
01:50:29,708 --> 01:50:33,076
- I need it translated as fast as you can.
- Whose account is it?

1016
01:50:33,169 --> 01:50:34,746
Jordan Kalfus.

1017
01:50:34,838 --> 01:50:41,718
It looks like US deposits and withdrawals.
Give me the same thing on Samuel Ramos.

1018
01:50:41,803 --> 01:50:43,462
- That's it?
- That's it.

1019
01:50:44,639 --> 01:50:45,303
OK.

1020
01:51:11,707 --> 01:51:13,783
Poraqui, porfavor.

1021
01:51:31,143 --> 01:51:33,598
Creasy.

1022
01:51:33,687 --> 01:51:35,560
- Samuel.
- Honey?

1023
01:51:41,403 --> 01:51:43,728
What's goin' on?

1024
01:51:43,822 --> 01:51:45,980
That's what I wanna know.

1025
01:51:47,076 --> 01:51:48,451
What is goin' on?

1026
01:51:50,454 --> 01:51:52,530
Sam?

1027
01:51:53,832 --> 01:51:58,992
I'm gonna ask your wife
a couple of questions, OK? You move...

1028
01:51:59,087 --> 01:52:01,375
You make one sound...

1029
01:52:02,341 --> 01:52:07,417
and I'll snatch the life right out ofyou,
you understand?

1030
01:52:11,516 --> 01:52:13,674
What happened, Lisa?

1031
01:52:15,228 --> 01:52:19,557
Were you in on this,
or was itjust your husband?

1032
01:52:19,649 --> 01:52:21,606
- Am I in on what?
- You know what.

1033
01:52:21,693 --> 01:52:24,362
Pita's kidnapping, her death.
Were you a part of it?

1034
01:52:24,446 --> 01:52:27,814
- Pita got killed because the ransom...
- Shut up!

1035
01:52:29,075 --> 01:52:31,566
Yeah, the money was stolen, you're right.

1036
01:52:31,661 --> 01:52:37,331
The money was stolen by Victor Fuentes.
How much was stolen? $2.5 million, right?

1037
01:52:37,417 --> 01:52:40,453
- What are you talkin' about?
- He knows what I'm talkin' about.

1038
01:52:40,545 --> 01:52:43,249
- That's what Victor got.
- What are you talkin' about?

1039
01:52:43,340 --> 01:52:47,171
2.5 million.
2.5 million to your lawyer, Jordan Kalfus.

1040
01:52:47,260 --> 01:52:53,677
He put it in an account in the Cayman lslands,
but he won't get a chance to spend it.

1041
01:52:54,392 --> 01:52:56,680
What happened to the other five, Sam?

1042
01:52:56,769 --> 01:52:58,428
That's 2.5, 2.5.

1043
01:52:58,521 --> 01:53:01,724
What is five from ten? Five.
What happened to the other five?

1044
01:53:01,816 --> 01:53:03,642
Tell your wife. This is your chance.

1045
01:53:03,735 --> 01:53:05,727
- You got a wife, Creasy?
- No, I don't.

1046
01:53:05,820 --> 01:53:08,607
You'll never know how hard it is
to tell your wife the truth.

1047
01:53:08,698 --> 01:53:11,615
No, you have a wife!
You tell me what happened!

1048
01:53:11,701 --> 01:53:15,994
- It was in this room that my father...
- I don't give a fuck about your father!

1049
01:53:16,080 --> 01:53:19,994
He prayed for his gambling debts
and his infidelities to be forgiven.

1050
01:53:20,084 --> 01:53:21,459
- Samuel!
- What?

1051
01:53:21,544 --> 01:53:26,336
- I love you! Tell me the truth!
- I didn't inherit a kingdom! That's the truth!

1052
01:53:26,424 --> 01:53:29,709
You wanna know the truth?
I inherited his debt and his mess!

1053
01:53:29,802 --> 01:53:32,755
- Tell me what happened to my baby!
- I inherited his lawyer!

1054
01:53:32,847 --> 01:53:35,384
Say it! Say it! Say it!

1055
01:53:35,474 --> 01:53:38,143
Say it! Be a fuckin' man!

1056
01:53:41,730 --> 01:53:46,190
Jordan told me she'd sit in a room
and watch cartoons all day.

1057
01:53:46,277 --> 01:53:48,684
And she'd eat ice cream.

1058
01:53:48,779 --> 01:53:52,527
And we'd have her back in two days.
He lied to me!

1059
01:53:52,616 --> 01:53:55,533
That's why he's fucking dead. I did it!

1060
01:53:55,619 --> 01:53:57,695
I did it, Lisa!

1061
01:53:58,288 --> 01:54:00,494
I agreed to the kidnapping.

1062
01:54:00,582 --> 01:54:04,081
I did it for us. For the three of us.

1063
01:54:12,136 --> 01:54:14,212
I'm so sorry, Lisa.

1064
01:54:20,602 --> 01:54:22,678
You kill him.

1065
01:54:24,147 --> 01:54:25,938
You kill him, or I will.

1066
01:54:57,138 --> 01:54:59,344
You know how they say a...

1067
01:55:00,725 --> 01:55:03,809
bullet always tells the truth.

1068
01:55:12,779 --> 01:55:14,855
It never lies.

1069
01:55:27,627 --> 01:55:30,627
It didn't work for me, Samuel,

1070
01:55:30,713 --> 01:55:32,789
but maybe...

1071
01:55:35,968 --> 01:55:38,968
maybe it'll work for you.

1072
01:55:47,605 --> 01:55:49,063
I'll pray for you.

1073
01:57:25,660 --> 01:57:28,993
This is definitely the address
from the ATM card.

1074
01:57:30,581 --> 01:57:34,115
The PIN number was a great locator.

1075
01:57:34,210 --> 01:57:38,871
But there's no one that sounds
anything like The Voice.

1076
01:57:40,883 --> 01:57:43,456
Who's that?

1077
01:57:44,303 --> 01:57:45,631
He's the man,

1078
01:57:45,721 --> 01:57:47,179
The Voice.

1079
01:57:47,807 --> 01:57:50,048
My guys got into the house...

1080
01:57:51,519 --> 01:57:54,306
on the pretext of giving cholera shots.

1081
01:57:57,024 --> 01:57:59,312
We had to inject the whole barrio.

1082
01:58:01,946 --> 01:58:06,157
We bugged the house
and stole the picture of him.

1083
01:58:14,667 --> 01:58:17,703
Now it's time to pursue him.

1084
01:58:18,754 --> 01:58:22,169
We have to put his photo in
tomorrow's newspaper.

1085
01:58:57,626 --> 01:59:00,626
Ifyou value your life,

1086
01:59:00,754 --> 01:59:03,920
you won't publish those photos.

1087
01:59:17,979 --> 01:59:19,556
- ?Hola?
- Hola.

1088
01:59:19,647 --> 01:59:22,564
- Mr Creasy?
- Yeah, it's me.

1089
01:59:22,650 --> 01:59:25,853
I traced the PIN for you and I have an address.

1090
01:59:25,945 --> 01:59:26,727
Yeah?

1091
01:59:26,821 --> 01:59:30,320
The cardholder is Reina Rosas Sanchez,
the wife of "The Voice".

1092
01:59:30,408 --> 01:59:34,701
She lives in Los Arcos,
apartment 26D, via Appia.

1093
01:59:34,787 --> 01:59:37,242
- Good.
- And another thing.

1094
01:59:37,332 --> 01:59:39,657
In today's paper is a picture of The Voice.

1095
01:59:39,751 --> 01:59:41,209
"FEAR HAS A VOICE."

1096
01:59:41,294 --> 01:59:42,918
Good. Thank you.

1097
02:00:56,952 --> 02:00:57,817
He's in.

1098
02:00:57,911 --> 02:00:59,618
What do we do?

1099
02:01:00,205 --> 02:01:01,319
Nothing... Nothing.

1100
02:01:51,839 --> 02:01:53,831
José, ?qué te pasa?

1101
02:01:54,759 --> 02:01:56,003
Alto, alto, alto...

1102
02:01:56,552 --> 02:01:57,962
Out of my house, you son of a bitch!

1103
02:01:58,054 --> 02:01:59,464
Stop there!

1104
02:02:47,936 --> 02:02:49,643
Get out. The kids out. Now!

1105
02:02:51,899 --> 02:02:54,935
!Salgan, ahora!

1106
02:02:58,947 --> 02:03:00,191
Sit down.

1107
02:03:03,327 --> 02:03:04,821
Sit down!

1108
02:03:07,164 --> 02:03:08,408
Reina Rosas, yes?

1109
02:03:10,083 --> 02:03:12,752
- Si.
- OK.

1110
02:03:17,048 --> 02:03:20,298
Who is this? Who is this?

1111
02:03:23,263 --> 02:03:24,887
?Quién es éste?

1112
02:03:32,272 --> 02:03:34,181
?Quién es éste?

1113
02:03:34,482 --> 02:03:34,979
Daniel.

1114
02:03:35,191 --> 02:03:36,104
Daniel what?

1115
02:03:36,651 --> 02:03:37,813
Daniel Rosas Sanchez.

1116
02:03:39,737 --> 02:03:42,441
The Voice?

1117
02:03:42,532 --> 02:03:45,236
- Si.
- OK.

1118
02:03:46,077 --> 02:03:47,784
And this is his brother?

1119
02:03:49,455 --> 02:03:51,364
- ?Si?
- Si.

1120
02:03:51,541 --> 02:03:52,489
What is his name?

1121
02:03:55,837 --> 02:03:56,868
What is his name?

1122
02:03:57,964 --> 02:03:58,580
Aurelio.

1123
02:03:58,673 --> 02:04:01,377
Aurelio Rosas Sanchez, OK.

1124
02:04:05,972 --> 02:04:08,094
OK.

1125
02:04:14,814 --> 02:04:17,601
And you are Daniel's woman, right?

1126
02:04:17,775 --> 02:04:19,566
- Si.
- ?Si?

1127
02:04:19,652 --> 02:04:20,932
How do you contact him?

1128
02:04:23,698 --> 02:04:25,690
How do you contact him?

1129
02:04:25,991 --> 02:04:28,149
We page him,

1130
02:04:31,664 --> 02:04:33,537
and he calls back on his cellphone.

1131
02:04:36,293 --> 02:04:37,870
Call him.

1132
02:04:49,598 --> 02:04:51,637
There's no signal in here.

1133
02:04:51,725 --> 02:04:54,132
We have to go on the roof.

1134
02:04:56,772 --> 02:04:57,803
Let's go outside.

1135
02:05:06,990 --> 02:05:08,816
Outside.

1136
02:05:19,836 --> 02:05:21,034
Momento.

1137
02:05:21,129 --> 02:05:22,291
They're going to get a call.

1138
02:05:23,715 --> 02:05:25,422
Be ready to track him.

1139
02:05:26,384 --> 02:05:30,002
Ifwe're lucky he'll lead us to The Voice.

1140
02:05:52,202 --> 02:05:53,400
Hola, Daniel.

1141
02:05:53,495 --> 02:05:56,946
- Señor Creasy.
- Yeah.

1142
02:05:57,040 --> 02:05:59,531
Yeah, I got your family here.

1143
02:05:59,626 --> 02:06:02,461
Your brother doesn't look too good.

1144
02:06:02,545 --> 02:06:06,625
Yeah, Reina, she's what,
about eight months? Yeah?

1145
02:06:07,550 --> 02:06:10,123
You wanna negotiate?

1146
02:06:12,555 --> 02:06:18,972
The most important thing in life is family.
Do you agree?

1147
02:06:20,688 --> 02:06:22,063
I agree.

1148
02:06:23,774 --> 02:06:26,347
There you are, you have my family.

1149
02:06:26,444 --> 02:06:29,314
Well, most of my family.

1150
02:06:29,947 --> 02:06:33,565
My wife and I are separated.
You know how that is.

1151
02:06:33,659 --> 02:06:37,442
Now, tell me seriously,
how much do you want?

1152
02:06:41,667 --> 02:06:45,166
Your brother wants to speak to you.
Here, hold on.

1153
02:06:50,467 --> 02:06:51,711
What the hell do you want?

1154
02:06:53,304 --> 02:06:55,343
Listen to me! Listen!

1155
02:06:55,431 --> 02:06:58,550
I'll take your family apart
piece by piece. You understand me?

1156
02:06:58,642 --> 02:07:00,764
Piece by piece! Shut up!

1157
02:07:01,937 --> 02:07:04,724
I don't want your money.

1158
02:07:04,815 --> 02:07:07,685
You understand me? You understand me?

1159
02:07:07,776 --> 02:07:10,349
I want you!

1160
02:07:43,061 --> 02:07:44,934
I'm listening.

1161
02:07:45,021 --> 02:07:48,639
I'm listening, Daniel. I'm listening.

1162
02:07:54,406 --> 02:07:58,071
All right. I will give you a life for a life.

1163
02:07:59,661 --> 02:08:02,198
Whose life? What are you talkin' about?

1164
02:08:02,288 --> 02:08:05,123
Whose life, Daniel? I want you!

1165
02:08:05,750 --> 02:08:08,750
I will give you her life. For your life.

1166
02:08:08,836 --> 02:08:13,248
And in exchange, I will get my life back.

1167
02:08:13,341 --> 02:08:18,465
- What life? Whose life?
- The girl's. Pita's.

1168
02:08:21,224 --> 02:08:24,177
- Pita's dead!
- Creasy!

1169
02:08:25,353 --> 02:08:29,765
I'm a businessman.
A girl dead is worth nothing.

1170
02:08:29,857 --> 02:08:30,888
She's alive.

1171
02:08:34,987 --> 02:08:37,063
All right.

1172
02:08:38,950 --> 02:08:44,324
I want proof of life, you hear me?
I want proof of life. I want...

1173
02:08:44,413 --> 02:08:47,781
I want the name of her bear.
What does she call her bear?

1174
02:08:47,875 --> 02:08:52,453
You tell her to tell you to tell me
what she calls her bear.

1175
02:09:03,557 --> 02:09:05,514
Little one...

1176
02:09:05,601 --> 02:09:07,889
What do you call your teddy bear?

1177
02:09:21,825 --> 02:09:23,484
Yeah?

1178
02:09:23,577 --> 02:09:27,195
Creasy. She calls the bear Creasy Bear.

1179
02:09:32,502 --> 02:09:33,830
Remember...

1180
02:09:33,920 --> 02:09:36,078
I will give you her life

1181
02:09:36,173 --> 02:09:38,165
for your life

1182
02:09:38,675 --> 02:09:41,047
and the life of my brother.

1183
02:09:43,472 --> 02:09:45,548
OK.

1184
02:09:47,267 --> 02:09:48,926
OK.

1185
02:09:49,978 --> 02:09:53,927
I give you your brother, you give me the girl.

1186
02:09:54,024 --> 02:09:56,859
- All right.
- Where?

1187
02:10:11,541 --> 02:10:15,918
He left the roof. We lost the signal.

1188
02:10:16,004 --> 02:10:17,546
We got cut off.

1189
02:10:19,465 --> 02:10:21,291
We lost him. We lost him.

1190
02:10:23,595 --> 02:10:24,543
Damn.

1191
02:10:41,696 --> 02:10:45,147
- Hello?
- Lisa, listen to me. Don't hang up.

1192
02:10:45,241 --> 02:10:47,317
I think Pita's alive.

1193
02:10:49,245 --> 02:10:51,533
I can't take this any more.

1194
02:10:51,622 --> 02:10:56,497
Take the road to Puebla.
Get offjunction 34, south side.

1195
02:10:56,585 --> 02:10:58,661
I'll meet you there in two hours.

1196
02:11:44,591 --> 02:11:46,916
So where is she?

1197
02:11:48,387 --> 02:11:52,764
She's right over there.
You see those two cars out there?

1198
02:11:58,063 --> 02:12:00,139
Pita's kidnapper, Daniel...

1199
02:12:01,358 --> 02:12:03,564

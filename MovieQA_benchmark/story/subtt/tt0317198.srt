1
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,041
Another year,
a brand new diary.

2
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:21,441
Once again I was summoned,
kicking and screaming,

3
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,521
to my mother's turkey curry buffet,

4
00:01:23,681 --> 00:01:27,602
where I've had some of the most
shaming experiences of my life.

5
00:01:28,042 --> 00:01:30,082
Hello, darling.

6
00:01:30,762 --> 00:01:33,082
Lovely to see you.

7
00:01:33,242 --> 00:01:35,282
It was, as usual, crammed full

8
00:01:35,442 --> 00:01:38,323
with some of the most dangerous perverts
in the UK,

9
00:01:38,482 --> 00:01:41,402
disguised as close, personal friends
of my parents.

10
00:01:41,563 --> 00:01:43,323
- Hello, Bridget.
- Hello, Una.

11
00:01:43,483 --> 00:01:45,803
- Oh, no, thanks.
- Love the jumper.

12
00:01:45,963 --> 00:01:49,443
- I prefer what's underneath it.
- Uncle Geoffrey!

13
00:01:49,603 --> 00:01:51,724
- Hello, gorgeous.
- Hello.

14
00:01:52,603 --> 00:01:55,483
- Hello, darling.
- Hello, Dad. How's it going?

15
00:01:55,643 --> 00:01:57,164
I wish I was dead.

16
00:01:57,324 --> 00:02:02,764
But this year,
there was one crucial difference.

17
00:02:06,925 --> 00:02:10,165
- Nice jumper.
- My mother's taste never falters.

18
00:02:13,005 --> 00:02:14,926
Never.

19
00:02:47,248 --> 00:02:51,088
You always wonder how it's going
to work out at the end of the story.

20
00:02:51,248 --> 00:02:53,368
Maria and Captain Von Trapp,

21
00:02:53,528 --> 00:02:55,288
Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,

22
00:02:55,448 --> 00:02:58,409
Mark Darcy and Bridget Jones.

23
00:02:58,569 --> 00:03:01,769
I've found my happy ending at last.

24
00:03:01,929 --> 00:03:05,690
And nothing in the world can spoil it.

25
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:08,209
Well, almost nothing.

26
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:11,410
Bridget Jones,
what the fuck are you doing?

27
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:16,931
- I, I can't see anywhere soft to land.
- How about on your arse?

28
00:03:17,091 --> 00:03:20,371
Bridget, unless you want to get sacked
at 6,000 feet,

29
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:23,571
you will be on your way
in exactly three seconds.

30
00:03:23,731 --> 00:03:26,371
Three, two, one... cue Bridget.

31
00:03:27,492 --> 00:03:29,051
Skydiving:

32
00:03:29,211 --> 00:03:32,812
A dangerous bane to the countryside
and emergency services,

33
00:03:32,972 --> 00:03:36,052
or a safe and exhilarating hobby?

34
00:03:36,212 --> 00:03:39,293
Well... let's see, shall we?

35
00:03:39,453 --> 00:03:41,773
Go. Jump.

36
00:03:41,932 --> 00:03:44,532
For Christ’s sakes, go!

37
00:03:48,013 --> 00:03:50,893
- She's out. Unit Two, you got her?
- We see her.

38
00:03:51,053 --> 00:03:53,654
Bridget, open the chute.

39
00:03:55,694 --> 00:03:57,694
Open it.

40
00:03:58,294 --> 00:04:00,374
Open your fucking parachute!

41
00:04:00,534 --> 00:04:03,094
Pull the thingy or you will die!

42
00:04:08,455 --> 00:04:09,455
Oh.

43
00:04:09,615 --> 00:04:14,095
Honestly,
you forget just one teeny, weeny detail

44
00:04:14,255 --> 00:04:16,456
and everyone treats you like an idiot.

45
00:04:17,136 --> 00:04:22,176
# Nobody does it better

46
00:04:23,656 --> 00:04:29,097
# Makes me feel sad for the rest

47
00:04:30,656 --> 00:04:33,617
# Nobody does it

48
00:04:33,776 --> 00:04:38,177
# Half as good as you

49
00:04:38,337 --> 00:04:40,618
# Baby, baby

50
00:04:41,217 --> 00:04:48,618
# Darling, you're the best

51
00:04:49,218 --> 00:04:51,699
# Baby, you're the best...

52
00:04:51,859 --> 00:04:56,059
Where was I?
Oh, yes... Mark Darcy.

53
00:04:56,219 --> 00:05:00,699
The question is: What happens
after you walk off into the sunset?

54
00:05:00,859 --> 00:05:04,740
Bridget?
Earth to Bridget Sodding Jones.

55
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:18,820
Bridget, you're on.
You're live.

56
00:05:19,421 --> 00:05:23,341
Well, this is Bridget Jones
for Sit Up Britain,

57
00:05:23,501 --> 00:05:26,821
reporting to you
from a big vat of excrement.

58
00:05:29,142 --> 00:05:32,742
Give me a close-up of the porker.

59
00:05:39,822 --> 00:05:42,822
Who cares about
the odd professional hiccup?

60
00:05:42,983 --> 00:05:45,303
I've been in a functional relationship

61
00:05:45,463 --> 00:05:48,543
with an adult male
for six wonderful weeks,

62
00:05:48,703 --> 00:05:52,224
four fabulous days
and seven precious hours.

63
00:05:53,263 --> 00:05:57,624
Or to put it another way,
71 ecstatic shags.

64
00:05:59,624 --> 00:06:03,345
He's given up being snooty,
and I've given up smoking.

65
00:06:04,744 --> 00:06:07,545
- # Loving you...
- Well, he thinks I have anyway,

66
00:06:07,705 --> 00:06:09,705
which is practically the same thing.

67
00:06:09,865 --> 00:06:12,025
#... a dream come true...

68
00:06:13,105 --> 00:06:15,025
Mark Darcy is perfect.

69
00:06:15,185 --> 00:06:18,666
Not a fuckwit, alcoholic, workaholic,
pervert or megalomaniac,

70
00:06:18,826 --> 00:06:21,626
but total sex god
and human rights lawyer.

71
00:06:21,786 --> 00:06:24,426
He is a miracle, really.

72
00:06:24,586 --> 00:06:27,067
Bridget, will you stop?

73
00:06:27,226 --> 00:06:29,787
Stop staring at me.
Go and find something to do.

74
00:06:29,947 --> 00:06:31,667
Sorry.

75
00:06:33,827 --> 00:06:35,947
# La la la la la...

76
00:06:36,107 --> 00:06:39,787
So, as you can see,
the incredible truth is

77
00:06:39,948 --> 00:06:42,867
the wilderness years are over.

78
00:06:43,027 --> 00:06:47,268
Bridget Jones is a love pariah no more.

79
00:06:51,108 --> 00:06:53,188
Morning, Bridget. Late again.

80
00:06:54,589 --> 00:06:56,549
Yes. Sorry.

81
00:06:57,109 --> 00:06:59,309
I was in bed with my boyfriend.

82
00:06:59,469 --> 00:07:01,749
He's a human rights lawyer, you know.

83
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:03,749
Yes, we know.

84
00:07:04,829 --> 00:07:08,389
I cannot believe how fantastic
shagging was last night.

85
00:07:09,069 --> 00:07:10,990
Maybe I'll ring him.

86
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:12,870
No, no...

87
00:07:13,031 --> 00:07:16,950
Obviously it's important to tell one's
boyfriend how nice he looks naked,

88
00:07:17,111 --> 00:07:20,631
but I have crucial,
Pulitzer Prize winning journalism to do.

89
00:07:26,271 --> 00:07:27,791
Hello?

90
00:07:27,952 --> 00:07:31,232
It's me. Just wondered how you are.

91
00:07:31,392 --> 00:07:34,152
I'm fine, thanks.
Everything all right with you?

92
00:07:34,312 --> 00:07:36,312
Fine, though, er...

93
00:07:36,912 --> 00:07:40,792
I've just had a rather graphic
shag flashback.

94
00:07:41,352 --> 00:07:45,593
And you do have
a genuinely gorgeous bottom.

95
00:07:46,033 --> 00:07:47,673
Thank you.

96
00:07:47,833 --> 00:07:51,473
I'm with the Mexican ambassador,
the head of Amnesty International

97
00:07:51,633 --> 00:07:54,554
and the Undersecretary
for Trade and Industry.

98
00:07:55,474 --> 00:07:57,514
And you're on speakerphone.

99
00:07:59,674 --> 00:08:01,874
Oh. Right, well...

100
00:08:02,034 --> 00:08:04,435
I'm quite busy
with important stuff too...

101
00:08:04,595 --> 00:08:08,795
Bridget, we're waiting for that tape
about Tom, the happy hamster.

102
00:08:08,955 --> 00:08:12,435
- I'll call when I've finished.
- Excellent.

103
00:08:12,595 --> 00:08:15,915
And Richard wants to see you
about that crap skydiving report.

104
00:08:16,075 --> 00:08:18,235
Oh, fuck.

105
00:08:19,476 --> 00:08:23,476
Oh, dear. Is this the end of my career?

106
00:08:24,236 --> 00:08:26,156
No, it can't be.

107
00:08:26,316 --> 00:08:30,996
I will fight this. I am a journalist of
the highest standards and integrity.

108
00:08:37,317 --> 00:08:41,638
This is Bridget Jones
reporting from a big vat of excrement.

109
00:08:41,797 --> 00:08:45,198
Look, I never said I could skydive
and I'm terrified of heights,

110
00:08:45,357 --> 00:08:49,958
- so it was really hard to concentrate.
- Be quiet. They loved it upstairs.

111
00:08:50,118 --> 00:08:53,839
Loved it. And they want us to come up
with another regular spot for you.

112
00:08:53,998 --> 00:08:56,839
Oh, my God. That's...

113
00:08:57,399 --> 00:08:59,959
- I won't let you down, Richard.
- Precisely.

114
00:09:00,119 --> 00:09:03,799
...my friends’ motto was "When in Rome,
do as many Romans as you can. "

115
00:09:03,959 --> 00:09:08,679
But if your tastes are marginally
more highbrow, I also have tips.

116
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:11,640
Forget the Forum,
definitely forget the Coliseum,

117
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:14,240
no fun now they can't
slaughter Christians.

118
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:19,041
Forget the Sistine Chapel, first example
of a poof interior designer gone mad...

119
00:09:19,201 --> 00:09:23,521
What is Daniel Cleaver
doing on the television?

120
00:09:23,681 --> 00:09:26,961
It's called The Smooth Guide.
"Making culture bearable".

121
00:09:27,121 --> 00:09:31,802
...equally serene and equally beautiful
Professor Giovana Dabrache.

122
00:09:31,962 --> 00:09:34,162
Who is about to show me her diptych.

123
00:09:34,322 --> 00:09:36,402
Same old creep.

124
00:09:36,562 --> 00:09:38,482
Oh. Shame.

125
00:09:38,642 --> 00:09:41,163
He always speaks very warmly of you.

126
00:09:41,322 --> 00:09:42,803
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

127
00:09:42,963 --> 00:09:45,442
How about we go out
for a bite to eat tonight?

128
00:09:45,603 --> 00:09:48,603
Oh. Can’t.
I have to go out with my boyfriend.

129
00:09:48,763 --> 00:09:50,883
- He's a human rights lawyer.
- I know.

130
00:09:51,044 --> 00:09:53,084
I'm meeting him for a romantic supper.

131
00:09:53,244 --> 00:09:54,564
Oh.

132
00:09:55,524 --> 00:09:57,684
- Bridget Jones.
- Bridget, it's Mark.

133
00:09:57,844 --> 00:10:00,564
Oh. I was just talking about you.

134
00:10:00,724 --> 00:10:03,284
I'm running late.
Do you want me to cancel?

135
00:10:03,444 --> 00:10:06,245
- Oh. No, that's fine.
- Are you sure?

136
00:10:06,405 --> 00:10:08,525
Be as late as you like.

137
00:10:10,125 --> 00:10:13,525
Chuck him, while you're not pregnant
with his unwanted child.

138
00:10:13,686 --> 00:10:15,446
I only said he was working late.

139
00:10:15,606 --> 00:10:18,846
In one hour, he'll be coming
in his secretary's mouth

140
00:10:19,006 --> 00:10:21,686
while he rings to say
what he wants for starters.

141
00:10:21,846 --> 00:10:24,846
Friends spend years
finding you a boyfriend,

142
00:10:25,006 --> 00:10:26,926
then instantly tell you to dump him.

143
00:10:27,086 --> 00:10:30,446
Even if he isn't shagging her already,
he's thinking about it.

144
00:10:30,606 --> 00:10:34,647
A man dating a woman with large breasts
will bed one with small breasts.

145
00:10:34,807 --> 00:10:37,647
Rubbish. Mark's above all that nonsense.

146
00:10:37,807 --> 00:10:40,568
Jellyfisher alert. Jellyfisher alert.

147
00:10:42,608 --> 00:10:46,448
Janey Osborne.
Talking to her is like swimming in a sea

148
00:10:46,608 --> 00:10:49,728
and being stung repeatedly
by an enormous jellyfish.

149
00:10:49,889 --> 00:10:54,409
Bridget. How's it going
with that divine man of yours?

150
00:10:54,569 --> 00:10:57,369
You must be so pleased
to have a boyfriend at last.

151
00:10:57,529 --> 00:10:59,409
First jellyfish of the evening.

152
00:10:59,569 --> 00:11:01,809
Is he taking you
to the Law Council Dinner?

153
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:04,209
Oh. Well, I'm sure he's just forgotten.

154
00:11:04,369 --> 00:11:06,730
Better start slimming into that dress.

155
00:11:06,890 --> 00:11:11,050
He's given you the night off
to cheer up your single friends. Sweet.

156
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:15,890
Actually, he's got a big case on, trying
to get everyone in Mexico out of prison.

157
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:18,730
We're meeting for a very late
romantic dinner.

158
00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:21,211
Really? That's so odd,

159
00:11:21,371 --> 00:11:25,091
'cause I saw him an hour ago going
into his house with Rebecca Gillies.

160
00:11:25,251 --> 00:11:28,292
She's only 22.
She's got legs up to here.

161
00:11:28,452 --> 00:11:30,691
And Daddy owns half of Australia.

162
00:11:33,092 --> 00:11:34,812
See ya, babes.

163
00:11:38,012 --> 00:11:42,092
Who is Rebecca Gillies? What's she doing
going into my boyfriend's house?

164
00:11:42,253 --> 00:11:45,413
Where he never asks me.
And with legs up to here?

165
00:11:45,573 --> 00:11:49,213
- My legs only come up to there.
- You have fine legs.

166
00:11:49,373 --> 00:11:51,293
Climber’s legs.

167
00:11:51,453 --> 00:11:54,054
I say go over there and ask him,
straight out,

168
00:11:54,214 --> 00:11:57,094
are you or are you not
sleeping with Rebecca Gillies?

169
00:11:57,254 --> 00:12:01,054
- If he says...
- I won't dignify that with an answer...

170
00:12:01,214 --> 00:12:03,135
Then you know he's shagging her.

171
00:12:03,975 --> 00:12:07,454
# All that I have
is all that you've given...

172
00:12:07,615 --> 00:12:11,615
It's all about confidence and
trust. Mark would never betray me.

173
00:12:11,775 --> 00:12:15,015
Everything will be lovely
and we'll have sex in the kitchen.

174
00:12:16,775 --> 00:12:19,095
- Oh, God.
- I'm coming.

175
00:12:19,255 --> 00:12:21,656
Oh, God! What is that?

176
00:12:21,815 --> 00:12:24,256
Two seconds,
I'll be straight down.

177
00:12:24,417 --> 00:12:26,337
Who is that?

178
00:12:26,496 --> 00:12:29,057
#... I find you lied

179
00:12:29,217 --> 00:12:32,376
# And I can't believe it's true

180
00:12:33,257 --> 00:12:38,297
# Wrapped in her arms
I see you across the street

181
00:12:38,457 --> 00:12:40,777
# I see you across the street

182
00:12:40,937 --> 00:12:47,098
# And I can't help but wonder
If she knows what's going on

183
00:12:48,218 --> 00:12:53,418
# You talk of love
But don't know how it feels

184
00:12:55,698 --> 00:12:58,139
# When you realize

185
00:12:58,699 --> 00:13:01,699
# You're not the only one

186
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:03,459
Let's get on with it.

187
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:06,699
#... oh, you better stop

188
00:13:06,859 --> 00:13:09,180
- # Stop
- # Before

189
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:11,900
# You tear me all apart

190
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:14,020
# You better stop

191
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:17,181
- # Stop...
- You are a very demanding man.

192
00:13:17,341 --> 00:13:20,301
#... you go and break my heart...

193
00:13:24,221 --> 00:13:27,181
Bridget Jones.

194
00:13:27,341 --> 00:13:29,382
No, I'm Bridget Jones.

195
00:13:29,542 --> 00:13:32,262
- That's what I meant.
- You must be...

196
00:13:32,422 --> 00:13:35,662
Rebecca Gillies. I've been
so looking forward to meeting you

197
00:13:35,822 --> 00:13:38,822
- after everything Mark's told me.
- Why? What's he said?

198
00:13:40,022 --> 00:13:41,982
- Where is Mark?
- Actually, er...

199
00:13:42,143 --> 00:13:44,863
- Becky, who is it?
- Becky?

200
00:13:45,023 --> 00:13:47,503
- Right.
- Great.

201
00:13:48,223 --> 00:13:50,303
- Right...
- Bridget.

202
00:13:52,543 --> 00:13:54,463
Hello, Mark.

203
00:14:00,264 --> 00:14:02,544
Hello...

204
00:14:02,704 --> 00:14:05,584
lawyers who work with Mark.

205
00:14:05,745 --> 00:14:07,785
Good evening.

206
00:14:07,945 --> 00:14:10,905
Everything under control, I see.

207
00:14:11,065 --> 00:14:13,425
Um... Excellent graph.

208
00:14:15,265 --> 00:14:17,586
- Lovely legs.
- Thank you.

209
00:14:24,586 --> 00:14:26,746
I am so sorry.

210
00:14:26,907 --> 00:14:30,467
I thought...
Oh, I don't know what I thought.

211
00:14:30,626 --> 00:14:32,546
Now you're really angry with me.

212
00:14:32,706 --> 00:14:35,627
- No, I'm not.
- It's OK, you can say if you are.

213
00:14:35,787 --> 00:14:39,067
- It's not the end of the world.
- I'll get you a glass of wine.

214
00:14:40,188 --> 00:14:42,788
The thing is I ran into Janey Osborne,

215
00:14:42,948 --> 00:14:47,868
who said she'd just seen you
with this girl, with really long legs,

216
00:14:48,028 --> 00:14:51,948
and Shazzer and Jude said
I should get over here straightaway.

217
00:14:52,108 --> 00:14:55,789
Following the orders of the dating
war command, you executed a raid.

218
00:14:55,949 --> 00:14:58,629
- You are angry.
- I'm not, just disappointed.

219
00:14:58,789 --> 00:15:02,309
Disappointed?
Oh, God, that's worse than angry.

220
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:07,750
I'm just disappointed
I can't take you home this instant.

221
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:13,110
Oh.
What about all those lawyers?

222
00:15:13,271 --> 00:15:17,270
Oh, plenty of time to butter them up
at the Law Council Dinner next Friday.

223
00:15:26,071 --> 00:15:28,271
Don't want to go, do you?

224
00:15:28,431 --> 00:15:30,112
I'd love to.

225
00:15:36,152 --> 00:15:38,352
Oh, stupid Bridget, stupid friends.

226
00:15:38,513 --> 00:15:41,073
Wonderful, loyal Mark Darcy...

227
00:15:42,433 --> 00:15:45,033
...who loves me just the way I am.

228
00:16:11,034 --> 00:16:14,115
- What are you doing?
- Getting dressed.

229
00:16:14,275 --> 00:16:16,595
Why are you dancing around in that tent?

230
00:16:16,756 --> 00:16:22,155
Because I don't want you to see
any of my wobbly bits.

231
00:16:22,316 --> 00:16:26,117
That's pointless, because I have
a very high regard for your wobbly bits

232
00:16:26,276 --> 00:16:28,196
in all circumstances.

233
00:16:28,356 --> 00:16:30,276
- Really?
- Absolutely.

234
00:16:30,877 --> 00:16:33,157
I think it's high time
we had another look.

235
00:16:34,757 --> 00:16:36,157
# Yeah

236
00:16:37,517 --> 00:16:39,517
# Are you digging on me?

237
00:16:39,678 --> 00:16:41,397
# Yeah

238
00:16:42,357 --> 00:16:44,678
# I'm digging on you, now, baby

239
00:16:44,838 --> 00:16:46,038
# Yeah

240
00:16:47,318 --> 00:16:49,478
# Do you want a little bit of my love?

241
00:16:49,638 --> 00:16:50,638
# Yeah...

242
00:16:50,799 --> 00:16:54,438
He really is very, very, very nice.

243
00:16:55,719 --> 00:16:57,719
# All the time I knew

244
00:16:57,879 --> 00:16:59,439
# That you loved me

245
00:17:00,239 --> 00:17:01,959
# And you promised me...

246
00:17:02,119 --> 00:17:04,119
I miss you too.

247
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:09,120
# That you would be my only man

248
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,439
# Yeah

249
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,841
# Are you digging on me?

250
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:17,720
I've never been happier
in my entire life.

251
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:20,961
However, must not obsess or fantasize.

252
00:17:22,521 --> 00:17:24,441
Bridget Darcy.

253
00:17:24,601 --> 00:17:26,561
Mrs. Darcy.

254
00:17:26,721 --> 00:17:28,762
Mr. And Mrs. Darcy.

255
00:17:28,922 --> 00:17:31,242
Lord and Lady Darcy.

256
00:17:33,802 --> 00:17:36,802
Wonder what Mark Darcy
would be like as a father.

257
00:17:36,962 --> 00:17:39,242
To his children, I mean, not to me.

258
00:17:39,402 --> 00:17:42,203
That would be a weird,
Oedipus-like thought.

259
00:17:42,763 --> 00:17:45,282
At last, life is on track.

260
00:17:45,443 --> 00:17:48,843
Bridget Jones: Fiancée, wife...

261
00:17:49,003 --> 00:17:50,363
mother.

262
00:17:50,523 --> 00:17:52,443
Bugger.

263
00:17:52,603 --> 00:17:56,084
Ever fancied doing it in the dark
with a total stranger?

264
00:18:00,564 --> 00:18:03,044
All right, perhaps not a total stranger.

265
00:18:04,565 --> 00:18:08,484
Back off, Cleaver, or I'll report you
to a sexual harassment tribunal.

266
00:18:08,645 --> 00:18:10,045
I'm a serious journalist.

267
00:18:10,205 --> 00:18:12,565
Is that your most serious skirt, Jones?

268
00:18:12,725 --> 00:18:14,206
Oh...

269
00:18:14,365 --> 00:18:16,165
Do you like it?

270
00:18:16,325 --> 00:18:18,566
I thought you hated television.

271
00:18:18,726 --> 00:18:21,886
I hate watching television.
Being on it is... Hello there.

272
00:18:22,045 --> 00:18:23,966
...entirely different.

273
00:18:24,126 --> 00:18:27,966
Daniel, thought the Madrid piece
was outstanding, really original.

274
00:18:28,126 --> 00:18:31,926
Cheers, Jeremy. Appreciate that.
We had to work really hard on that one.

275
00:18:32,086 --> 00:18:35,087
Tosser. Talking of which,
how is Mark Darcy?

276
00:18:36,447 --> 00:18:38,567
- You still...?
- Yes, I am.

277
00:18:38,727 --> 00:18:41,048
And I intend to be for a very long time.

278
00:18:41,208 --> 00:18:44,768
Good. You know what a fan I am
of any woman married to Mark Darcy.

279
00:18:44,928 --> 00:18:48,048
- That's not funny.
- Seriously, though, Jones,

280
00:18:48,208 --> 00:18:50,888
speaking purely unselfishly,
I worry about you.

281
00:18:51,328 --> 00:18:55,329
You do know that it's a fact that
most lawyer's wives die of boredom?

282
00:18:55,928 --> 00:18:59,369
And what about you?
Still shagging anything that moves?

283
00:18:59,889 --> 00:19:02,649
As a matter of fact, no.
No shagging whatsoever.

284
00:19:02,809 --> 00:19:04,930
I'm in shag therapy.

285
00:19:05,090 --> 00:19:09,089
It turns out I have a problem. I go
to meetings, talk about my feelings.

286
00:19:09,249 --> 00:19:11,210
Hug people who smell.

287
00:19:11,370 --> 00:19:13,970
- I don't believe you.
- I'm trying...

288
00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:16,290
...to be a better man, Bridge,

289
00:19:16,451 --> 00:19:19,250
so that the next time
a better woman comes along,

290
00:19:19,410 --> 00:19:22,331
I won't make a pig's ear of it.

291
00:19:23,291 --> 00:19:25,291
Daniel. Meeting?

292
00:19:25,891 --> 00:19:27,891
Yeah, yeah. Thanks.

293
00:19:29,612 --> 00:19:31,532
Very good hair, Jones.

294
00:19:33,772 --> 00:19:37,252
By the way, um, you're not free
for dinner tonight, are you?

295
00:19:37,412 --> 00:19:40,972
No, I'm not.
I'm going to the Law Council Dinner.

296
00:19:41,133 --> 00:19:43,493
It's a very important evening.

297
00:19:47,373 --> 00:19:49,134
I can't wear that.

298
00:19:49,293 --> 00:19:53,334
Bridge, do you want to get married and
have babies before you become barren?

299
00:19:53,494 --> 00:19:54,574
Trust me...

300
00:19:54,734 --> 00:19:58,494
Magda: My only grown-up
friend. Married to Mark's partner.

301
00:19:58,654 --> 00:20:02,374
She actually got engaged
on the night of the Law Council Dinner.

302
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:04,455
Try it with the dress.

303
00:20:04,615 --> 00:20:05,934
Oh, my God!

304
00:20:06,095 --> 00:20:09,854
Remember, we are trying to reduce
your body size by 15 per cent.

305
00:20:10,015 --> 00:20:13,215
You hold the front, I'll hold the back.
One, two, three...

306
00:20:15,815 --> 00:20:18,535
What's going on in there?

307
00:20:19,495 --> 00:20:21,056
Not too bad, actually.

308
00:20:22,976 --> 00:20:24,616
Tra-la!

309
00:20:25,176 --> 00:20:26,736
Fantastic.

310
00:20:26,896 --> 00:20:30,017
Right, let us begin.

311
00:20:30,176 --> 00:20:34,177
I am going to make you into a princess.

312
00:20:34,337 --> 00:20:35,417
Goody.

313
00:20:35,577 --> 00:20:39,137
Nothing like being
in the hands of a total genius.

314
00:20:41,737 --> 00:20:43,497
Wow.

315
00:20:46,338 --> 00:20:49,178
- Whatever you do...
- Bugger it.

316
00:20:49,338 --> 00:20:51,298
...don't iron your hair.

317
00:20:52,138 --> 00:20:54,178
It's a lot worse than I thought.

318
00:20:54,338 --> 00:20:56,339
We could flatten it with Brylcream.

319
00:20:56,498 --> 00:20:58,779
What about a wig? Lawyers love wigs.

320
00:20:58,939 --> 00:21:03,099
- I preferred you in the gold.
- No, whatever you do, not the gold.

321
00:21:03,259 --> 00:21:07,860
Great. I'm late with mad hair and can
barely breathe in scary knickers.

322
00:21:08,019 --> 00:21:11,460
# La la la
La la la la la...

323
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:14,060
Oh, God. I'm very worried.

324
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:19,101
What if someone says "Bridget Jones,
get out of here, you are ridiculous"?

325
00:21:20,021 --> 00:21:21,781
Stop it.

326
00:21:21,941 --> 00:21:26,141
The most important thing, of course,
is to look absolutely wonderful

327
00:21:26,301 --> 00:21:28,862
and make a magnificent entrance.

328
00:21:29,262 --> 00:21:32,142
# I just can't get you out of my head...

329
00:21:40,742 --> 00:21:43,663
Hi. Sorry I'm late.

330
00:21:44,143 --> 00:21:47,983
- Hello.
- I think you should go to the ladies.

331
00:21:48,143 --> 00:21:50,664
But I went before I left home.

332
00:21:51,543 --> 00:21:53,223
Trust me on this one.

333
00:21:53,944 --> 00:21:55,544
Oh.

334
00:21:55,704 --> 00:21:57,624
Not good.

335
00:21:59,224 --> 00:22:01,505
All right, tiny make-up mistake,

336
00:22:02,984 --> 00:22:06,385
but I always have wit and conversation
to fall back on.

337
00:22:15,385 --> 00:22:17,065
Thank you.

338
00:22:18,985 --> 00:22:20,946
- Bridget.
- Hello.

339
00:22:21,986 --> 00:22:24,186
Derek, Horatio, Camilla.

340
00:22:24,346 --> 00:22:27,427
- Horatio?
- Yes, Horatio.

341
00:22:27,586 --> 00:22:31,227
Horatio was just saying
he's totally against charitable giving.

342
00:22:33,906 --> 00:22:36,827
- What?
- Well, obviously you don't mean it.

343
00:22:36,987 --> 00:22:41,347
Absolutely. Do you think it's helpful
to give a beggar fifty pence?

344
00:22:41,507 --> 00:22:44,428
- Maybe he's just hungry.
- Don't be so naive.

345
00:22:44,587 --> 00:22:48,308
The people you see outside the tube
every day are there by choice.

346
00:22:48,468 --> 00:22:51,348
- End of story.
- Oh, no, it's not.

347
00:22:51,508 --> 00:22:54,029
Some people
have terrible personal problems,

348
00:22:54,188 --> 00:22:58,909
and other people might have lost their
family in some tragic ferry disaster.

349
00:22:59,069 --> 00:23:02,589
And some people are just plain hopeless.

350
00:23:02,749 --> 00:23:07,430
Honestly, this is the sort of rubbish
you'd expect from fat, balding

351
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:13,391
Tory, Home Counties,
upper-middle-class twits.

352
00:23:24,751 --> 00:23:27,352
Yeah, very good.
Tested my resolve.

353
00:23:31,872 --> 00:23:33,431
How did I do?

354
00:23:33,592 --> 00:23:36,312
You seem to have made
quite an impression.

355
00:23:36,992 --> 00:23:39,232
I've put you next to Giles Benwick.

356
00:23:39,392 --> 00:23:42,672
- Oh, I'm not sitting next to you?
- No. He's terribly nice,

357
00:23:42,833 --> 00:23:46,312
but his wife's just run off
with one of the partners.

358
00:23:46,473 --> 00:23:49,194
He probably won't mention it,
but you should know.

359
00:23:49,353 --> 00:23:52,113
I always knew she was out of my league.

360
00:23:52,273 --> 00:23:58,154
You see, there's the high-fliers,
like Annabel and Mark Darcy

361
00:23:58,314 --> 00:24:02,874
and there's the gorgeous girls,
like Rebecca there

362
00:24:03,035 --> 00:24:05,394
and there's the rest of us.

363
00:24:07,515 --> 00:24:10,075
Like you and me, you mean?

364
00:24:10,235 --> 00:24:12,195
Absolutely.

365
00:24:12,355 --> 00:24:15,395
I mean, look at the state of us.

366
00:24:16,235 --> 00:24:20,755
You and me stumbled into the VIP room
by mistake

367
00:24:20,915 --> 00:24:24,356
and it's only a matter of moments
before they show us the door.

368
00:24:30,116 --> 00:24:35,237
My lords, ladies and gentlemen,
let the quiz begin.

369
00:24:36,037 --> 00:24:39,317
Oh, goody. I love quizzes.

370
00:24:39,997 --> 00:24:43,478
All those years of playing
Trivial Pursuits are about to pay off.

371
00:24:44,838 --> 00:24:48,918
Now I want to see your hands
poised over those bells. Ready?

372
00:24:49,078 --> 00:24:52,638
Here we go. What are something
called "customary freeholds"?

373
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:55,878
Superior copyhold.

374
00:24:56,038 --> 00:24:57,238
Yes.

375
00:24:57,398 --> 00:25:00,039
What is the correct grace
used in the Inner Temple

376
00:25:00,199 --> 00:25:03,520
for the second mooting night
of Michaelmas term?

377
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:07,679
Amas bibendo... fructis.

378
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:10,959
Jolly good.
What is an overreaching conveyance?

379
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:14,200
What is rack-rent?
When was breach of promise abolished?

380
00:25:14,361 --> 00:25:16,320
Define "damnum sentit dominus".

381
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:21,441
Translate "reddendo singula singulis"
into Ancient Greek.

382
00:25:21,601 --> 00:25:23,721
I believe this is the answer.

383
00:25:25,401 --> 00:25:29,042
Hippodamoi credemnon louestai.

384
00:25:29,201 --> 00:25:32,202
Absolutely correct.

385
00:25:36,002 --> 00:25:39,603
Now, for our final
and deciding round,

386
00:25:39,762 --> 00:25:43,202
the category is contemporary culture.

387
00:25:44,963 --> 00:25:48,243
Who did the design
for Princess Diana's wedding dress?

388
00:25:49,243 --> 00:25:51,643
The Emmanuels.

389
00:25:51,804 --> 00:25:54,124
- Correct.
- Excellent, Bridget.

390
00:25:54,284 --> 00:25:57,203
Name the character in Footballers' Wives

391
00:25:57,364 --> 00:26:02,884
who, in one memorable episode,
set fire to her own breasts.

392
00:26:03,044 --> 00:26:04,364
Chardonnay.

393
00:26:04,524 --> 00:26:06,445
Correct.

394
00:26:08,365 --> 00:26:11,565
At this point,
there are only two tables in contention

395
00:26:11,725 --> 00:26:14,085
and only one question left.

396
00:26:16,325 --> 00:26:19,405
What was the name of Madonna's
first UK single?

397
00:26:19,565 --> 00:26:21,885
Lucky Star.

398
00:26:22,046 --> 00:26:25,126
- Sorry, I didn't quite hear.
- Are you sure?

399
00:26:25,286 --> 00:26:28,246
- Wasn't it Holiday?
- No, everyone thinks it is,

400
00:26:28,406 --> 00:26:29,566
but it's not.

401
00:26:29,726 --> 00:26:32,606
My entire life has been leading up
to this very moment.

402
00:26:32,767 --> 00:26:36,767
Take that knife, slice off my head
and boil it if I'm wrong.

403
00:26:37,687 --> 00:26:40,407
The correct answer is Lucky Star.

404
00:26:42,528 --> 00:26:44,768
No.

405
00:26:44,927 --> 00:26:47,608
- The correct answer is...
- Is it Holiday?

406
00:26:47,768 --> 00:26:50,648
Holiday, indeed, yes.

407
00:26:52,888 --> 00:26:57,408
The winners of
the 42nd Annual Law Council Quiz are...

408
00:26:57,569 --> 00:26:59,649
the Legal Eagles.

409
00:27:05,289 --> 00:27:08,170
- Lovely to see you, Bridget.
- Oh, thanks, Rebecca.

410
00:27:08,330 --> 00:27:10,250
Good night.

411
00:27:27,292 --> 00:27:29,811
Why didn't you speak to me all night?

412
00:27:29,971 --> 00:27:32,212
That's the point of those dinners.

413
00:27:32,372 --> 00:27:35,892
But you talked to Rebecca.
And you talked to Horatio.

414
00:27:38,092 --> 00:27:40,092
I'll never fit in with your friends.

415
00:27:40,252 --> 00:27:44,293
Not if you go on calling everyone
"balding, upper-middle-class twits".

416
00:27:44,452 --> 00:27:47,533
Well, they were balding,
upper-middle-class twits.

417
00:27:47,693 --> 00:27:49,773
Except for the ones who had hair.

418
00:27:50,493 --> 00:27:54,053
I suppose you agree with them
that poor people deserve to be poor?

419
00:27:54,213 --> 00:27:56,133
Don't be ridiculous.

420
00:27:56,294 --> 00:27:59,813
- So now I'm ridiculous?
- Yes, tonight you were a little.

421
00:27:59,974 --> 00:28:02,334
Well, tonight you were an arrogant arse.

422
00:28:04,894 --> 00:28:07,654
I think I may have
made a mistake inviting you

423
00:28:07,814 --> 00:28:10,254
and your folding underpants
into my life.

424
00:28:13,055 --> 00:28:14,975
Good night.

425
00:28:18,856 --> 00:28:20,896
If you had asked me tonight,

426
00:28:21,495 --> 00:28:23,976
I'd have said no, anyway.

427
00:28:26,376 --> 00:28:28,057
Asked you what?

428
00:28:28,216 --> 00:28:30,736
Bridget?

429
00:28:30,897 --> 00:28:32,817
Asked you what?

430
00:28:43,658 --> 00:28:45,938
Oh, God, I've done it.

431
00:28:46,098 --> 00:28:48,138
I've gone and done it.

432
00:28:48,298 --> 00:28:52,218
One minute, you're closer to someone
than anyone in the whole world,

433
00:28:52,378 --> 00:28:55,339
next minute,
you're never going to see them again.

434
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:17,141
If you have a message for
Mark Darcy, please speak after the tone.

435
00:29:18,541 --> 00:29:22,540
Hello, it's me.
I'm really, really sorry...

436
00:29:24,381 --> 00:29:26,461
Sorry, it's the door.

437
00:29:26,622 --> 00:29:30,101
Don't go away, I have something
really, really important to say.

438
00:29:40,662 --> 00:29:43,102
- Yes, who is it?
- It's me.

439
00:29:43,262 --> 00:29:45,903
- Mark.
- Oh, right.

440
00:29:46,063 --> 00:29:48,183
Er, just a moment.

441
00:29:49,223 --> 00:29:50,904
I'm on the phone.

442
00:29:54,263 --> 00:29:56,384
You're outside.

443
00:29:57,424 --> 00:29:59,384
Look, er...

444
00:30:00,104 --> 00:30:02,025
I'll ring you later.

445
00:30:03,424 --> 00:30:06,704
Unless you've come to chuck me
once and for all.

446
00:30:07,144 --> 00:30:09,064
In which case,

447
00:30:09,225 --> 00:30:13,265
bye and thank you,
and... sorry.

448
00:30:14,985 --> 00:30:17,025
Oh, God, please don't chuck me.

449
00:30:17,185 --> 00:30:19,786
If you have chucked me,
please change your mind,

450
00:30:19,946 --> 00:30:21,906
I'll behave much better in future.

451
00:30:22,065 --> 00:30:24,466
On the other hand, if you haven't,

452
00:30:24,626 --> 00:30:28,026
please behave better
next time we go out. Stuck-up snob.

453
00:30:35,147 --> 00:30:36,627
What do you want?

454
00:30:36,787 --> 00:30:39,627
I'd like to come up.
You are, after all, my girlfriend.

455
00:30:39,787 --> 00:30:42,988
Even though I shouted at you
and called you an arrogant arse?

456
00:30:43,148 --> 00:30:46,308
Unfortunately, yes.
You see, the problematic thing is...

457
00:30:47,388 --> 00:30:49,308
I love you.

458
00:30:51,269 --> 00:30:52,629
W- what?

459
00:31:02,549 --> 00:31:05,989
- I said I love you.
- I'm sorry, I missed that again.

460
00:31:06,149 --> 00:31:08,029
I said I love you, for God's sake!

461
00:31:13,150 --> 00:31:15,790
All right, no need to shout.

462
00:31:15,951 --> 00:31:17,910
I'll come down and let you in.

463
00:31:28,911 --> 00:31:31,391
You might be needing this in the future.

464
00:31:39,273 --> 00:31:41,272
He said he loves me.

465
00:31:41,433 --> 00:31:45,273
- He said he loves you?
- He said he loves me.

466
00:31:45,433 --> 00:31:49,193
- Right, where is he now?
- He's in the bedroom.

467
00:31:50,353 --> 00:31:52,273
Go back in there, Bridge,

468
00:31:52,434 --> 00:31:56,473
and whatever you do,
act completely nonchalant.

469
00:32:01,154 --> 00:32:03,634
Bridget, you're staring at me again.

470
00:32:04,314 --> 00:32:05,834
Sorry.

471
00:32:07,434 --> 00:32:10,635
Listen, I know this evening
didn't go exactly as planned,

472
00:32:12,595 --> 00:32:16,235
but there was a very important question
I wanted to ask you tonight.

473
00:32:18,155 --> 00:32:20,556
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

474
00:32:23,356 --> 00:32:26,597
I've actually been meaning
to ask this for quite some time.

475
00:32:26,756 --> 00:32:30,476
I've just never really found
the right way to put it.

476
00:32:34,837 --> 00:32:36,757
Darling Bridget...

477
00:32:39,277 --> 00:32:40,917
...would you...

478
00:32:42,117 --> 00:32:44,597
...like to go on a skiing mini-break?

479
00:32:48,918 --> 00:32:50,358
Yes!

480
00:32:50,918 --> 00:32:55,679
# What the world...

481
00:32:55,838 --> 00:32:58,159
This is not just a mini-break.

482
00:32:59,319 --> 00:33:02,439
This is a holiday in heaven.

483
00:33:04,639 --> 00:33:08,599
Told a tiny lie about being
an extremely experienced skier.

484
00:33:09,559 --> 00:33:12,200
But, honestly, how hard can it be?

485
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:15,161
- Ah.
- Shall we?

486
00:33:21,521 --> 00:33:24,121
I know I'm going to like skiing a lot.

487
00:33:24,281 --> 00:33:27,001
Very romantic, very relaxing.

488
00:33:28,241 --> 00:33:31,042
- Bar going up.
- No. What? Why?

489
00:33:36,282 --> 00:33:37,842
Um...

490
00:33:38,483 --> 00:33:39,882
Er...

491
00:33:40,042 --> 00:33:41,962
Oh. Oh, God.

492
00:33:44,883 --> 00:33:46,602
Oh, God. Oh.

493
00:33:51,483 --> 00:33:53,124
Ah.

494
00:34:08,164 --> 00:34:09,885
Bridget.

495
00:34:10,044 --> 00:34:13,325
Rebecca. What are you doing here?

496
00:34:13,485 --> 00:34:16,726
- Didn't Mark tell you we were coming?
- No, he didn't.

497
00:34:16,886 --> 00:34:18,965
It was me who recommended the place.

498
00:34:19,125 --> 00:34:21,766
- I've been coming since I was 11.
- Really?

499
00:34:21,926 --> 00:34:23,446
Three whole years.

500
00:34:23,606 --> 00:34:25,726
Come on, up you get.

501
00:34:25,886 --> 00:34:27,566
Come on.

502
00:34:28,486 --> 00:34:30,727
- There you go.
- Are you all right?

503
00:34:31,886 --> 00:34:33,607
Yes, fine, thanks.

504
00:34:33,767 --> 00:34:36,007
- You sure?
- Why is Rebecca here?

505
00:34:36,167 --> 00:34:39,287
Oh, God. Well, I mentioned
that we were coming

506
00:34:39,447 --> 00:34:43,328
and she said why didn't they come too,
and I couldn't say no, could I?

507
00:34:43,488 --> 00:34:45,847
Come on, you two, let's crack on,
shall we?

508
00:34:46,687 --> 00:34:49,888
Actually, I might just sit this one out.
You head on.

509
00:34:50,048 --> 00:34:52,368
- See you down there.
- You sure?

510
00:34:52,529 --> 00:34:54,688
Absolutely. I'll be fine in a minute.

511
00:34:54,849 --> 00:34:57,248
Right, I'll see you at base camp, then.

512
00:34:59,529 --> 00:35:03,689
Bastard.
I can't believe he's left me.

513
00:35:07,330 --> 00:35:08,489
Ooh.

514
00:35:16,210 --> 00:35:17,690
Oooh.

515
00:35:27,971 --> 00:35:32,132
So, romantic getaway
has turned into lawyer's reunion.

516
00:35:32,292 --> 00:35:33,731
Oooh.

517
00:35:33,892 --> 00:35:36,852
I can't believe
we're already into group holidays

518
00:35:37,012 --> 00:35:40,212
after only eight weeks
of total, undisturbed sex.

519
00:35:40,852 --> 00:35:42,773
Wait a minute...

520
00:35:42,932 --> 00:35:45,252
No. Eight weeks?

521
00:35:45,412 --> 00:35:47,733
It couldn't be, could it?

522
00:35:47,893 --> 00:35:49,933
Totally undisturbed...

523
00:35:50,093 --> 00:35:53,253
Oh, God. I'm pregnant.

524
00:35:57,774 --> 00:35:59,734
And going to die!

525
00:36:13,495 --> 00:36:16,496
Oh, my God!

526
00:36:17,015 --> 00:36:18,536
I can't see!

527
00:36:18,696 --> 00:36:20,775
Big bump!

528
00:36:20,935 --> 00:36:22,975
Get out of the way!

529
00:36:25,936 --> 00:36:28,936
Who's this? An eccentric
but exhilarating performance

530
00:36:29,097 --> 00:36:30,217
from a total unknown,

531
00:36:30,376 --> 00:36:33,577
who's now solidly in position
for the bronze.

532
00:36:56,939 --> 00:37:00,219
I would like a pregnancy test, please.

533
00:37:00,699 --> 00:37:02,899
A pregnancy test.

534
00:37:03,259 --> 00:37:06,739
Ich bien, er, possibly...

535
00:37:06,899 --> 00:37:08,620
mit baby.

536
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:11,540
Er...

537
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:15,820
Kinder! I am on back...

538
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:18,101
and he, er...

539
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:21,941
maken ze lieben.
Er, with me.

540
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:25,101
She's pregnant!

541
00:37:27,022 --> 00:37:29,182
Oh, no! No, no, not pregnant.

542
00:37:30,101 --> 00:37:31,902
She's bloated.

543
00:37:32,062 --> 00:37:33,862
- Condom?
- Nein. Nein, nein.

544
00:37:34,021 --> 00:37:36,862
Maybe like this, but maybe like this.

545
00:37:37,942 --> 00:37:40,542
I think her problem is psychological.

546
00:37:40,702 --> 00:37:43,183
There is nothing
a pill can do to help her.

547
00:37:43,343 --> 00:37:46,023
I'm a girl and I met a boy.

548
00:37:46,183 --> 00:37:49,343
Fraulein, and I met frau... boy.

549
00:37:49,903 --> 00:37:54,144
And possibly now mit baby, uh-huh?

550
00:37:59,504 --> 00:38:01,824
Right, moment of truth awaits.

551
00:38:02,944 --> 00:38:04,865
What if I am pregnant?

552
00:38:05,665 --> 00:38:07,985
I must try not to get hopes up too high.

553
00:38:08,145 --> 00:38:11,105
Boyfriend and baby seems just too lucky.

554
00:38:11,265 --> 00:38:14,385
Bridget? I have been looking
everywhere for you.

555
00:38:14,545 --> 00:38:18,465
I thought you'd broken a leg
or something... Oh, God.

556
00:38:23,545 --> 00:38:26,186
- You're not...?
- I might be.

557
00:38:28,146 --> 00:38:31,666
- What if I were?
- Well, I suppose I'd...

558
00:38:32,707 --> 00:38:37,307
To be quite frank,
it'd be bloody fantastic.

559
00:38:37,467 --> 00:38:40,147
I mean, if a little ahead of schedule.

560
00:38:40,307 --> 00:38:44,068
- Are you really pregnant?
- Well, give it three minutes.

561
00:38:54,509 --> 00:38:58,829
- What do you fancy? Boy or a girl?
- I dunno, it doesn't matter.

562
00:38:59,829 --> 00:39:02,949
Although, I suppose I've always had
the fantasy of a son.

563
00:39:04,629 --> 00:39:07,910
- Another Mark Darcy.
- Or maybe something like Huck.

564
00:39:08,070 --> 00:39:11,750
Or River. Or some fabulous
Hebrew name like Noah.

565
00:39:11,910 --> 00:39:15,190
Anyway, I could teach him
to play cricket and rugby

566
00:39:15,350 --> 00:39:17,551
and visit him at Eton
on St Andrew's Day.

567
00:39:17,711 --> 00:39:18,710
Eton?

568
00:39:18,870 --> 00:39:22,831
Yes. The Darcy men have been going
to Eton for five generations.

569
00:39:23,951 --> 00:39:26,551
Well, my son's not going to be
sent away from home.

570
00:39:26,711 --> 00:39:30,791
Especially to some fascist institution
where they stick a poker up your arse

571
00:39:30,951 --> 00:39:33,352
that you're never allowed
to remove again.

572
00:39:34,312 --> 00:39:36,232
I see.

573
00:39:37,032 --> 00:39:39,113
- I didn't mean you.
- No, of course not.

574
00:39:39,272 --> 00:39:42,312
So what's the alternative?
Sleeping in his parents' bed,

575
00:39:42,472 --> 00:39:44,433
breastfeeding until he's a teenager

576
00:39:44,593 --> 00:39:48,953
and some progressive school, where the
day is spent singing Yellow Submarine?

577
00:39:49,113 --> 00:39:50,713
Oh, you're absolutely right.

578
00:39:50,873 --> 00:39:54,994
It's madness to allow a child to enjoy
his education or live with his parents.

579
00:39:55,154 --> 00:39:58,954
What is madness is to have a child
if his parents can't have a discussion

580
00:39:59,114 --> 00:40:00,994
without one shouting at the other.

581
00:40:01,154 --> 00:40:02,314
It's negative.

582
00:40:02,474 --> 00:40:04,834
- That's too bad.
- Yes, very sad.

583
00:40:38,437 --> 00:40:41,918
Perhaps we should go out for lunch
tomorrow. Get out of the grump.

584
00:40:44,758 --> 00:40:48,238
That's a good idea in theory,
but you made a family arrangement.

585
00:40:49,078 --> 00:40:51,198
Oh, God.

586
00:40:53,039 --> 00:40:54,198
Darlings!

587
00:40:54,358 --> 00:40:57,198
I've had the fabulous idea
of inviting your parents.

588
00:40:57,359 --> 00:41:00,319
Another one
of Mother's culinary triumphs.

589
00:41:00,479 --> 00:41:04,039
- Everything in miniature.
- Mini treacle tart, Admiral Darcy?

590
00:41:04,199 --> 00:41:08,080
No, no, thank you. The mini spotted dick
rather finished me off.

591
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:15,120
So, Mark, Bridget, when are you
two lovebirds going to name the day?

592
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:18,961
Bridget, you must want to hear
those ding-dong bells.

593
00:41:25,441 --> 00:41:29,361
Well, we're certainly not thinking
about that yet. Are we, Bridget?

594
00:41:30,082 --> 00:41:32,041
No. God, no.

595
00:41:32,201 --> 00:41:34,002
Of course not.

596
00:41:34,162 --> 00:41:36,522
Good.
Well, that's that sorted.

597
00:41:36,681 --> 00:41:39,202
So, Admiral, out on the high seas.
How was it?

598
00:41:54,084 --> 00:41:57,003
- Did you mean that thing you said?
- What thing?

599
00:41:57,163 --> 00:42:00,564
- You know what thing.
- No, I don't know what thing.

600
00:42:01,444 --> 00:42:03,364
The thing thing.

601
00:42:04,164 --> 00:42:07,044
Now, let's see, there are any number
of things, um...

602
00:42:07,204 --> 00:42:09,525
in an afternoon full
of all sorts of things,

603
00:42:09,685 --> 00:42:11,485
so I, um...

604
00:42:11,645 --> 00:42:16,005
The thing where you said
you're not, um...

605
00:42:18,766 --> 00:42:23,806
That you're not,
not even thinking about, um...

606
00:42:39,647 --> 00:42:42,007
What's the matter?

607
00:42:42,687 --> 00:42:44,727
Let's get a drink.

608
00:42:52,048 --> 00:42:55,568
I'm going to go to the loo,
then I'm going to come back.

609
00:42:55,728 --> 00:42:58,009
And then we're going to be civilized.

610
00:43:06,210 --> 00:43:09,289
If you have a message for Mark Darcy,
speak after the tone.

611
00:43:10,610 --> 00:43:12,730
Mark, it's Rebecca. Are you there?

612
00:43:14,250 --> 00:43:17,290
Obviously not.
Probably still out with Bridget.

613
00:43:18,250 --> 00:43:21,571
Um... Anyway, I hope lunch
with the parents went well.

614
00:43:21,731 --> 00:43:24,771
I'm sure you were dutiful
and very polite, as usual.

615
00:43:24,931 --> 00:43:29,851
Er... Whatever. Anyway, look, maybe
give me a ring when you get back.

616
00:43:30,011 --> 00:43:32,572
I thought I might pop round
for a nightcap.

617
00:43:33,492 --> 00:43:36,852
But I suppose that's a silly idea.
Bridget's probably there.

618
00:43:37,372 --> 00:43:39,532
Sleep tight.

619
00:43:43,492 --> 00:43:45,693
Oh, Christ, what now?

620
00:43:45,853 --> 00:43:49,653
Are you or are you not having an affair
with Rebecca Gillies?

621
00:43:50,333 --> 00:43:53,134
I won't dignify that question
with an answer.

622
00:43:53,294 --> 00:43:55,013
Right.

623
00:43:55,933 --> 00:43:57,694
All I did was go to the loo.

624
00:43:58,813 --> 00:44:00,614
Bridget!

625
00:44:02,934 --> 00:44:04,574
Bridget.

626
00:44:05,654 --> 00:44:07,975
That's not your coat.

627
00:44:09,654 --> 00:44:11,775
Oh, right.

628
00:44:19,216 --> 00:44:21,136
Oh, Bridget, what are you doing?

629
00:44:21,855 --> 00:44:26,376
I read you should never date someone if
you can think of three reasons not to.

630
00:44:26,536 --> 00:44:28,256
- Can you think of three?
- Yes.

631
00:44:28,417 --> 00:44:32,136
- Which are?
- Well, first off, I embarrass you.

632
00:44:32,296 --> 00:44:35,457
I can't ski, I can't ride,
I can't speak Latin.

633
00:44:35,617 --> 00:44:39,177
My legs only come up to here and yes,
I will always be a little bit fat.

634
00:44:39,337 --> 00:44:42,778
And you, you fold your underpants
before you go to bed.

635
00:44:42,938 --> 00:44:46,257
- Now, hang on, that can't be a reason.
- No, it's not a reason.

636
00:44:46,417 --> 00:44:48,418
But you're not perfect either.

637
00:44:48,578 --> 00:44:51,218
You look down your nose
at absolutely everyone,

638
00:44:51,378 --> 00:44:55,898
and you're incapable of doing anything
spontaneous or potentially affectionate.

639
00:44:56,059 --> 00:44:59,298
It feels like you're waiting
to find someone in the VIP room

640
00:44:59,459 --> 00:45:01,939
who's, who's so fantastic...

641
00:45:02,699 --> 00:45:04,620
just the way she is,

642
00:45:04,779 --> 00:45:07,340
that you don't need to fix her.

643
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:09,020
Bridget, this is mad.

644
00:45:09,179 --> 00:45:11,540
Perhaps you've already found her.

645
00:45:15,061 --> 00:45:17,260
Do you want to marry me?

646
00:45:19,301 --> 00:45:21,301
Look, I...

647
00:45:23,341 --> 00:45:26,301
You see, you can never
muster the strength...

648
00:45:27,501 --> 00:45:29,741
to fight for me.

649
00:45:48,343 --> 00:45:50,584
I can't believe I did that.

650
00:46:25,706 --> 00:46:30,347
# What do I gotta do
to make you love me?

651
00:46:32,907 --> 00:46:37,107
# What do I gotta do to make you care?

652
00:46:39,987 --> 00:46:44,868
# What do I gotta do
when lightning strikes me

653
00:46:45,028 --> 00:46:46,468
# Hmm

654
00:46:47,308 --> 00:46:51,268
# And I wake to find
that you're not there?

655
00:46:54,509 --> 00:46:59,029
# What do I gotta do
to make you want me?

656
00:46:59,509 --> 00:47:00,749
# Hmm

657
00:47:01,669 --> 00:47:05,909
# What do I gotta do to be heard?

658
00:47:08,710 --> 00:47:14,030
# And what do I say
when it's all over, babe?

659
00:47:14,190 --> 00:47:15,631
# Oooh-ooh

660
00:47:15,790 --> 00:47:19,991
# And sorry seems to be the hardest word

661
00:47:22,991 --> 00:47:26,511
# It's sad
So sad

662
00:47:26,671 --> 00:47:30,071
# Why can't we talk it over, babe?

663
00:47:30,231 --> 00:47:32,671
# Always seems to me

664
00:47:33,071 --> 00:47:37,472
# When sorry seems to be

665
00:47:38,232 --> 00:47:42,432
# The hardest word #

666
00:47:45,953 --> 00:47:48,033
Five weeks later.

667
00:47:48,193 --> 00:47:50,953
Weight: 4,000 pounds.

668
00:47:51,113 --> 00:47:55,153
Am enjoying a relationship with two men
simultaneously.

669
00:47:55,313 --> 00:47:58,514
The first is called Ben,
the other, Jerry.

670
00:47:58,674 --> 00:48:01,834
Number of current boyfriends: Zero.

671
00:48:01,994 --> 00:48:04,234
Number of calls from ex-boyfriend:

672
00:48:04,394 --> 00:48:07,595
You have absolutely no messages.

673
00:48:07,755 --> 00:48:11,275
Not a single one.
Not even from your mother.

674
00:48:16,915 --> 00:48:19,236
- Hello?
- Hello, darling.

675
00:48:19,396 --> 00:48:23,116
- You haven't forgotten our lunch date?
- Of course I have.

676
00:48:23,275 --> 00:48:26,236
- I'm suicidally depressed.
- Don't be silly, Bridget.

677
00:48:26,396 --> 00:48:28,756
Meet me at Debenhams at twelve o'clock.

678
00:48:29,876 --> 00:48:32,837
Mum... I thought we were going
to have something to eat.

679
00:48:32,997 --> 00:48:36,637
Patience, please. I've got
a big surprise for you, darling.

680
00:48:37,277 --> 00:48:40,237
- What?
- Don't say "what", say "pardon".

681
00:48:42,117 --> 00:48:43,798
Tra-la!

682
00:48:43,958 --> 00:48:46,877
- What do you think?
- Oh, my God.

683
00:48:47,038 --> 00:48:48,998
Daddy and I are getting married.

684
00:48:49,158 --> 00:48:51,838
- You're already married.
- We're doing it again.

685
00:48:51,998 --> 00:48:55,199
Reaffirming our vows.
You are going to be a bridesmaid,

686
00:48:55,359 --> 00:48:58,118
and absolutely everything
is going to be lavender.

687
00:48:58,278 --> 00:49:00,718
And when I say everything, I mean...

688
00:49:01,239 --> 00:49:02,719
...everything.

689
00:49:04,879 --> 00:49:07,039
Oh, God, I'm never going to get married

690
00:49:07,199 --> 00:49:09,680
and my sodding mum and dad
are doing it twice.

691
00:49:09,840 --> 00:49:13,640
# No more candlelight
No more romance

692
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:17,161
- # No more small talk...
- Bloody know-it-all.

693
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:22,721
New York: The Big, Juicy Apple.

694
00:49:22,881 --> 00:49:26,681
The city that never sleeps
with the same person two nights running.

695
00:49:26,841 --> 00:49:30,921
My favorite place in America, where Sex
And The City isn't just a program,

696
00:49:31,081 --> 00:49:32,961
it's a promise.

697
00:49:36,682 --> 00:49:38,762
Morning, Rach.

698
00:49:38,922 --> 00:49:40,642
Sorry.

699
00:49:40,802 --> 00:49:44,403
Oh, cheer up, misery guts.
I have good news for you.

700
00:49:44,563 --> 00:49:46,483
Sure, right.

701
00:49:46,643 --> 00:49:49,603
What's the angle?
I interview some rocket scientist

702
00:49:49,763 --> 00:49:52,603
while he looks through my skirt
with X-ray glasses?

703
00:49:52,763 --> 00:49:54,204
No.

704
00:49:54,803 --> 00:49:56,723
Although that is a bloody good idea.

705
00:49:57,324 --> 00:50:01,204
No. The fact is The Smooth Guide
is doing very well with women,

706
00:50:01,364 --> 00:50:05,684
but the network want us to cast
a wider net and use a Smooth Guide-ess.

707
00:50:05,845 --> 00:50:08,924
Me? With Daniel Cleaver?

708
00:50:09,085 --> 00:50:12,805
It's the next logical step.
I think Thailand is first on the list.

709
00:50:12,965 --> 00:50:15,525
No. I won't do it.

710
00:50:15,685 --> 00:50:18,365
Not now.
Not in a million years from now.

711
00:50:18,525 --> 00:50:21,166
- Excuse me?
- I am a top television journalist,

712
00:50:21,326 --> 00:50:23,486
not some boorish bint in a bikini.

713
00:50:23,646 --> 00:50:28,006
Really? Strong words from somebody
who doesn't know where Germany is.

714
00:50:28,166 --> 00:50:30,366
Who told you that?

715
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:33,927
Cleaver. He said he couldn't be expected
to go out with someone

716
00:50:34,166 --> 00:50:38,967
who thought Iran was David Bowie's wife,
and who didn't know where Germany was.

717
00:50:39,807 --> 00:50:46,008
Daniel Cleaver is a deceitful, sexist,
disgusting specimen of humanity,

718
00:50:46,168 --> 00:50:48,768
that I wouldn't share a lift with,
let alone a job.

719
00:50:48,928 --> 00:50:52,448
Come on, Jones, there must have been
something you liked about me.

720
00:50:52,608 --> 00:50:55,688
Well... you have a nice car.

721
00:50:56,729 --> 00:50:59,729
And quite nice manners.
Outside the bedroom.

722
00:50:59,889 --> 00:51:01,849
But that's about it.

723
00:51:02,369 --> 00:51:04,889
And by the way,
I know exactly where Germany is.

724
00:51:05,049 --> 00:51:08,370
The question is do you know the location
of your arsehole?

725
00:51:12,290 --> 00:51:17,051
As a matter of fact, I do know the
exact location of my arsehole. And hers.

726
00:51:18,411 --> 00:51:21,011
Oh, come on, Jones,
it was just a silly joke.

727
00:51:21,171 --> 00:51:22,651
Not a very funny one.

728
00:51:22,811 --> 00:51:24,171
- Go on, then.
- What?

729
00:51:24,331 --> 00:51:26,251
Where is it? Where is Germany?

730
00:51:26,411 --> 00:51:29,091
- Next to France.
- And?

731
00:51:29,252 --> 00:51:31,491
And also Belgium...

732
00:51:31,651 --> 00:51:34,172
Poland. And it has a sea coast.

733
00:51:34,892 --> 00:51:37,212
Which sea?

734
00:51:44,012 --> 00:51:45,933
Oh, sod it. Now, look,

735
00:51:46,093 --> 00:51:48,733
I think we should talk
about Finch's suggestion.

736
00:51:48,892 --> 00:51:50,893
I am going to Thailand, Jones.

737
00:51:51,053 --> 00:51:53,573
Wouldn't you like to be
my little Girl Guide?

738
00:51:53,853 --> 00:51:54,774
Thailand?

739
00:51:54,933 --> 00:51:58,493
- You'll shag before you leave Heathrow.
- I'll be perfectly fine.

740
00:51:58,653 --> 00:52:00,654
I'm eschewing all men.

741
00:52:01,214 --> 00:52:03,934
And cigarettes. And carbohydrates.

742
00:52:04,095 --> 00:52:06,855
- We can't possibly let you go.
- On your own.

743
00:52:07,014 --> 00:52:08,934
Oh, stop it, all of you.

744
00:52:09,094 --> 00:52:11,814
I am a mature, sophisticated,
professional woman

745
00:52:11,975 --> 00:52:16,535
and I'm going to Thailand
entirely on my own, thank you very much.

746
00:52:16,695 --> 00:52:18,096
- Fuck!
- Sorry.

747
00:52:18,255 --> 00:52:20,256
- Fuckity fuck.
- Sorry.

748
00:52:20,416 --> 00:52:24,816
And now our final passengers
have joined us, we can get underway.

749
00:52:24,976 --> 00:52:26,976
Someone's gotta be last.

750
00:52:28,216 --> 00:52:31,137
Are we not sitting together?

751
00:52:31,296 --> 00:52:33,216
Oh, fuck.

752
00:52:35,897 --> 00:52:38,697
I don't think we're really
in a position to, um...

753
00:52:39,417 --> 00:52:41,897
...make a fuss.
Sorry. Hi.

754
00:52:42,498 --> 00:52:44,698
Sorry.

755
00:52:45,898 --> 00:52:47,498
What's our film?

756
00:52:48,297 --> 00:52:50,578
What's your name? Mine's Olive.

757
00:52:50,738 --> 00:52:52,659
Er, Bridget.

758
00:52:52,818 --> 00:52:55,698
Good afternoon again,
ladies and gentlemen.

759
00:52:55,858 --> 00:52:58,659
We're about to offer a wide range
of duty-free items.

760
00:52:58,819 --> 00:53:01,419
Details can be found
in your in-flight magazine.

761
00:53:08,899 --> 00:53:12,940
Wonderful people, the Thais.
Particularly the young ladies.

762
00:53:13,100 --> 00:53:15,020
If you know what I mean, eh?

763
00:53:15,180 --> 00:53:17,780
- Oh, for heaven's sake.
- Come with me.

764
00:53:17,940 --> 00:53:20,061
Come with me now.

765
00:53:20,221 --> 00:53:22,661
- Where are we going?
- Just through here.

766
00:53:22,821 --> 00:53:24,861
Thank you. This is worse than school.

767
00:53:25,021 --> 00:53:27,061
It really wasn't my fault.

768
00:53:27,221 --> 00:53:29,501
It's a fizzy drink, you know, it just...

769
00:53:29,661 --> 00:53:31,781
It just sort of fizzied over.

770
00:53:33,102 --> 00:53:36,382
Couldn’t bear to think of you back there
in slum class, Jones.

771
00:53:36,542 --> 00:53:40,502
Graham, thank you. You are the best
air steward I've ever come across.

772
00:53:40,663 --> 00:53:42,662
And if I may say so, the smartest.

773
00:53:42,822 --> 00:53:44,223
Thank you, sir.

774
00:53:46,983 --> 00:53:49,663
I thought you were there already,
doing research.

775
00:53:49,823 --> 00:53:51,703
Fuck, no. I make it up as I go along.

776
00:53:51,863 --> 00:53:55,423
It's 13 hours for this trip.
I need some in-flight entertainment.

777
00:53:55,584 --> 00:53:59,104
Why don't you tell me, in detail,
about your school netball tour,

778
00:53:59,264 --> 00:54:02,624
particularly the unsavory incident
in the communal showers.

779
00:54:02,784 --> 00:54:05,744
I didn't play netball.
Or go to a girls' school.

780
00:54:05,905 --> 00:54:09,384
- Or have showers.
- Now that's just not true, is it?

781
00:54:09,545 --> 00:54:11,465
- Let me start you off.
- No.

782
00:54:11,625 --> 00:54:15,185
If you're gonna be dull, I'm going
to plunge back into Mrs. Dalloway,

783
00:54:15,345 --> 00:54:18,425
and you know how she loves that.
Dirty, dirty bitch.

784
00:54:39,227 --> 00:54:41,428
# Here's a new thing

785
00:54:41,588 --> 00:54:43,188
# That's gonna please ya

786
00:54:43,348 --> 00:54:45,747
# Just a little town down in Indonesia

787
00:54:45,948 --> 00:54:46,988
# Bangkok...

788
00:54:47,148 --> 00:54:49,868
Arrived Bangkok. Very hot.

789
00:54:50,028 --> 00:54:53,868
Relieved at last to throw myself
into serious journalistic work.

790
00:54:55,829 --> 00:54:59,829
Thailand has long called travelers
from around the globe

791
00:54:59,988 --> 00:55:03,509
to take spiritual succour
and karmic rest.

792
00:55:03,670 --> 00:55:08,590
For centuries, Western visitors
have been inevitably drawn

793
00:55:08,750 --> 00:55:11,990
to some of Bangkok's oldest sanctuaries.

794
00:55:12,150 --> 00:55:15,590
So true, Bridget. Even I,
fight it as I may, am no exception.

795
00:55:15,750 --> 00:55:19,711
The moment I arrive here,
I almost feel an irresistible pull...

796
00:55:19,870 --> 00:55:23,471
...to this. The Temple of Tranquility.

797
00:55:24,151 --> 00:55:28,991
Indeed, nothing symbolizes Thailand's
extraordinary fusion of East and West,

798
00:55:29,151 --> 00:55:32,432
of tradition and innovation,
better than this.

799
00:55:32,592 --> 00:55:34,752
Fully body-to-body massage.

800
00:55:34,912 --> 00:55:37,232
- Sawatdee kha?
- Sawatdee khrab?

801
00:55:37,392 --> 00:55:41,632
An incredible thing about Thailand
is the amazing traditional cuisine.

802
00:55:41,793 --> 00:55:45,672
I'm going to taste kapaluk,
the ultimate delicacy.

803
00:55:47,473 --> 00:55:49,713
Oh, fuck! Oh, fuck!

804
00:55:49,873 --> 00:55:51,793
Oh, my God. My God.

805
00:55:51,954 --> 00:55:54,394
Um... Er... Mmm.

806
00:55:54,554 --> 00:55:56,953
How about a lovely locust?

807
00:55:57,114 --> 00:55:59,194
I can't. No, no, I can't.

808
00:55:59,354 --> 00:56:01,314
They're delicious.

809
00:56:03,554 --> 00:56:04,914
Oh!

810
00:56:07,754 --> 00:56:12,715
Now that is Ko Panyi, which is
the setting for a very famous Thai poem,

811
00:56:12,875 --> 00:56:15,115
which I think you'd like very much,
Jones.

812
00:56:15,276 --> 00:56:19,315
It's all about a badly-behaved prince
who finds true love with a beautiful,

813
00:56:19,476 --> 00:56:22,555
and as it happens,
very slightly overweight princess.

814
00:56:23,276 --> 00:56:26,716
- You're teasing me.
- I never tease about poetry.

815
00:56:27,436 --> 00:56:31,157
"Oh, Suvarnamali
Why can you not see that I adore you?"

816
00:56:31,317 --> 00:56:33,637
"Why do you avoid and scorn me?"

817
00:56:33,797 --> 00:56:35,717
"If you cast me off and leave me

818
00:56:35,876 --> 00:56:37,997
How should I live another day?"

819
00:56:40,877 --> 00:56:44,998
And you thought all I knew of Thailand
was pussies and ping-pong balls.

820
00:56:45,158 --> 00:56:48,077
- You wouldn't sleep with him?
- No, of course not.

821
00:56:48,238 --> 00:56:50,518
Absolutely not.

822
00:56:50,678 --> 00:56:52,678
But he is clever.

823
00:56:52,839 --> 00:56:54,318
- Yes?
- And handsome.

824
00:56:54,479 --> 00:56:57,879
He's also a dysfunctional,
fucked-up, middle-aged, lost boy.

825
00:56:58,039 --> 00:56:59,959
Well, no-one's perfect.

826
00:57:04,719 --> 00:57:06,999
I didn't realize you were busy.

827
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:14,320
- He's young enough to be your grandson.
- I know. Isn't that great?

828
00:57:17,640 --> 00:57:21,481
Come on, guys, I've got a very special
treat lined up for lunch.

829
00:57:21,641 --> 00:57:23,921
I'm getting rather fond of Jed,

830
00:57:24,081 --> 00:57:27,321
and I must say he has a genuine interest
in Thai cuisine.

831
00:57:27,481 --> 00:57:31,242
I wouldn't have thought
omelet would be big in Thailand.

832
00:57:31,402 --> 00:57:34,882
- Or mushrooms, for that matter.
- It's magic.

833
00:57:37,642 --> 00:57:40,522
It is a magic mushroom omelet,
isn't it?

834
00:57:41,082 --> 00:57:45,483
Well, that's awful.
There is nothing funny in this at all.

835
00:57:47,563 --> 00:57:49,483
Although, thank God,

836
00:57:50,083 --> 00:57:52,883
the mushrooms don't actually
seem to be working.

837
00:57:58,404 --> 00:58:00,524
# Just what is it
that you want to do?

838
00:58:01,764 --> 00:58:05,724
Such lovely colors!

839
00:58:05,884 --> 00:58:08,764
# We wanna get loaded
And we wanna have a good time...

840
00:58:08,925 --> 00:58:13,485
Beautiful Bridget! Beautiful Bridget!
Beautiful Bridget!

841
00:58:16,045 --> 00:58:17,886
Bridget Jones!

842
00:58:20,565 --> 00:58:22,966
Bridget Jones!

843
00:58:23,126 --> 00:58:24,766
But, wait...

844
00:58:24,926 --> 00:58:28,126
- Bridget Jones?
- What sound is that?

845
00:58:33,527 --> 00:58:36,607
It is Daniel Cleaver.

846
00:58:36,767 --> 00:58:40,528
How unutterably beautiful he is.

847
00:58:41,967 --> 00:58:44,368
Jones, what the hell are you doing?

848
00:58:47,768 --> 00:58:50,488
You are lovely colors.

849
00:58:51,408 --> 00:58:54,048
- # I don't wanna lose your love...
- Here.

850
00:58:54,208 --> 00:58:56,208
Here I am.

851
00:58:57,009 --> 00:58:59,409
I think you're completely off your face.

852
00:59:00,729 --> 00:59:02,529
Hey.

853
00:59:02,689 --> 00:59:05,609
Bloody hell.

854
00:59:06,129 --> 00:59:09,050
Oh... Oh, I'm an angel.

855
00:59:09,970 --> 00:59:12,730
Oh. How lovely.

856
00:59:12,890 --> 00:59:15,170
Glorious sand.

857
00:59:15,330 --> 00:59:17,050
Oh.

858
00:59:17,210 --> 00:59:19,331
I want to be naked.

859
00:59:19,891 --> 00:59:24,091
- Naked as a baby.
- Come on, then, angel. Up you get.

860
00:59:27,211 --> 00:59:29,131
- All right?
- Mmm.

861
00:59:30,172 --> 00:59:33,531
- How are you feeling?
- Completely embarrassed.

862
00:59:33,692 --> 00:59:36,931
Don't be. You're charming on drugs.
In future, just say yes.

863
00:59:37,732 --> 00:59:42,692
Do you know, I never really understood
why you wanted to go out with me.

864
00:59:43,532 --> 00:59:46,373
- It seemed so unlikely.
- Come on. For God's sake.

865
00:59:46,532 --> 00:59:49,373
You're sexy. You make me laugh.

866
00:59:49,533 --> 00:59:51,853
At you, of course, not with you.

867
00:59:52,493 --> 00:59:54,454
And you were...

868
00:59:54,614 --> 00:59:56,333
...incidentally...

869
00:59:57,974 --> 00:59:59,694
...the best shag...

870
00:59:59,853 --> 01:00:01,414
...I ever had.

871
01:00:01,574 --> 01:00:03,094
The best?

872
01:00:03,254 --> 01:00:06,454
Aside from Simon Reade
in the fifth-form locker room, yeah.

873
01:00:07,414 --> 01:00:09,854
Suppose I said you were pretty good too?

874
01:00:11,855 --> 01:00:13,855
Pretty good?

875
01:00:14,895 --> 01:00:17,175
Was I better than Mark Darcy?

876
01:00:18,255 --> 01:00:22,495
By the way, is it true he always says
"I'm sorry, I think I'm going to come"?

877
01:00:22,656 --> 01:00:25,536
- Who told you that?
- It's common knowledge, isn't it?

878
01:00:26,736 --> 01:00:29,457
Come on, Jones. Who gave who the hoof?

879
01:00:29,616 --> 01:00:31,657
And why?

880
01:00:32,776 --> 01:00:34,737
Let's just say

881
01:00:34,897 --> 01:00:38,057
that we suffered
from a fatal incompatibility.

882
01:00:41,617 --> 01:00:43,737
I have missed you, Jones.

883
01:00:43,897 --> 01:00:46,538
I don't suppose
there's any circumstances

884
01:00:46,698 --> 01:00:48,978
in which you would ever consider

885
01:00:49,138 --> 01:00:51,819
thinking about trusting me again?

886
01:00:54,378 --> 01:00:56,299
Absolutely not.

887
01:01:02,539 --> 01:01:06,019
Well, I suppose I'll be getting back
to my little hut now.

888
01:01:06,740 --> 01:01:10,180
Thank you very much, Daniel.
I had a nice time.

889
01:01:21,261 --> 01:01:25,541
Is that the Big Dipper
or the little one?

890
01:01:25,701 --> 01:01:27,821
I can never tell them apart.

891
01:01:27,981 --> 01:01:29,662
Definitely the big one.

892
01:01:29,821 --> 01:01:32,741
You can't see the little one
this close to the equator.

893
01:01:32,901 --> 01:01:36,421
Oh, please.
You don't know about astronomy.

894
01:01:36,582 --> 01:01:39,022
I most certainly do.
I'm passionate about it.

895
01:01:41,302 --> 01:01:45,023
You know, Jones, if stargazing
is something that interests you,

896
01:01:45,183 --> 01:01:49,103
then it has to be said that the view
from my balcony is quite outstanding.

897
01:01:50,383 --> 01:01:53,223
Perhaps you'd like to come up
and have a little look?

898
01:01:53,384 --> 01:01:55,184
I don't think so.

899
01:01:55,343 --> 01:01:58,383
See over there? Along my arm.

900
01:01:58,544 --> 01:02:00,504
That's it, over there.

901
01:02:01,464 --> 01:02:03,704
That is Orion's Belt.

902
01:02:03,864 --> 01:02:08,944
And next to that is a very sexy little
constellation called Ursa's Maiden.

903
01:02:09,104 --> 01:02:10,105
Ah.

904
01:02:10,265 --> 01:02:13,505
She's being very naughty
and trying to undo Orion's belt.

905
01:02:14,465 --> 01:02:18,385
All right, what about...
that one?

906
01:02:19,345 --> 01:02:22,346
Yes, well that is
a very, very famous star.

907
01:02:22,505 --> 01:02:24,786
Um, right next to, of course, um...

908
01:02:26,906 --> 01:02:31,146
I don't know, some other fucking star
that's been there for years and years.

909
01:02:31,306 --> 01:02:34,507
Seen one star, you've seen the lot,
that's what I say, Jones.

910
01:02:37,907 --> 01:02:40,107
Different with girls, though.

911
01:02:42,108 --> 01:02:44,028
Some girls...

912
01:02:44,187 --> 01:02:46,107
...are special.

913
01:02:46,267 --> 01:02:48,307
Are they?

914
01:02:49,148 --> 01:02:51,068
I think so.

915
01:03:01,469 --> 01:03:04,549
What is this special power
you hold over me, Jones?

916
01:03:13,670 --> 01:03:15,790
And what about your therapy?

917
01:03:17,510 --> 01:03:19,511
I think you might be it.

918
01:03:19,671 --> 01:03:21,711
# I'm not in love

919
01:03:22,990 --> 01:03:24,910
# So don't forget it

920
01:03:26,351 --> 01:03:28,511
# It's just a silly phase

921
01:03:28,671 --> 01:03:30,591
# I'm going through

922
01:03:33,112 --> 01:03:35,071
# And just because

923
01:03:36,672 --> 01:03:38,592
# I call you up

924
01:03:40,032 --> 01:03:41,712
# Don't get me wrong

925
01:03:41,872 --> 01:03:44,712
# Don't think you've got it made

926
01:03:46,833 --> 01:03:48,753
# I'm not in love...

927
01:03:49,433 --> 01:03:52,153
God, I hope you're wearing
those giant panties.

928
01:03:52,313 --> 01:03:53,434
Please.

929
01:03:53,593 --> 01:03:56,434
Please be wearing the giant panties.

930
01:03:56,594 --> 01:03:58,594
Please.

931
01:03:58,754 --> 01:04:00,754
Oh, my old friends.

932
01:04:00,914 --> 01:04:03,554
Oh, Daddy's home.

933
01:04:03,714 --> 01:04:07,395
Did you miss me?
Because Daddy missed you. Yes, he did.

934
01:04:08,154 --> 01:04:09,674
Wait.

935
01:04:11,995 --> 01:04:13,515
Sorry.

936
01:04:13,675 --> 01:04:15,755
Can I just have a minute?

937
01:04:15,915 --> 01:04:17,836
Just a minute.

938
01:04:25,196 --> 01:04:27,597
Oh, God.
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God.

939
01:04:27,756 --> 01:04:31,356
# Big boys don't cry
Big boys don't cry

940
01:04:31,837 --> 01:04:35,277
# Big boys don't cry
Big boys don't cry...

941
01:04:47,998 --> 01:04:51,599
- Everything all right?
- Yeah, sure.

942
01:04:52,598 --> 01:04:54,638
Just a bit... nervous.

943
01:04:55,839 --> 01:04:58,478
I mean, you see,
if I stay with you tonight,

944
01:04:58,638 --> 01:05:02,599
well, it's definitely
the end of something...

945
01:05:02,759 --> 01:05:04,879
important with someone.

946
01:05:05,040 --> 01:05:07,679
Um, which has probably ended already,

947
01:05:07,839 --> 01:05:10,679
- but perhaps...
- Bridge, Bridge Bridge, Bridge.

948
01:05:10,839 --> 01:05:13,160
Doesn't everyone
deserve a second chance?

949
01:05:15,080 --> 01:05:16,440
Hmm?

950
01:05:22,841 --> 01:05:24,601
Except Hitler.

951
01:05:26,201 --> 01:05:29,361
Well, he was very, very, very naughty.

952
01:05:35,322 --> 01:05:36,642
What?

953
01:05:36,802 --> 01:05:40,202
Nothing. Er, come back later, please.
Thank you very much.

954
01:05:44,083 --> 01:05:46,443
Bridge, it's nothing.
Leave it. Leave it.

955
01:05:49,043 --> 01:05:51,523
You made order for 10.30.

956
01:05:52,443 --> 01:05:54,404
Order for what?

957
01:05:55,403 --> 01:05:56,763
Me.

958
01:05:56,923 --> 01:05:58,604
10.30.

959
01:06:01,604 --> 01:06:04,165
You know, I've had it up to here
with this hotel.

960
01:06:04,324 --> 01:06:08,005
- It's been cock-ups like this all week.
- You Mr. Cleaver?

961
01:06:08,164 --> 01:06:12,485
Yesterday, you with Maria.
She say you big tipper.

962
01:06:22,965 --> 01:06:25,446
I mean, I'm up for it if you are.

963
01:06:26,526 --> 01:06:29,886
Actually, no, that was stupid.
It's just one little slip.

964
01:06:30,046 --> 01:06:33,566
Don't let it ruin what was gonna be
a fantastic weekend shagathon.

965
01:06:33,727 --> 01:06:36,807
- I don't want a shagathon.
- No, nor do I. Nor do I.

966
01:06:36,966 --> 01:06:39,968
- You're right.
- You're looking for a weekend of sex,

967
01:06:40,127 --> 01:06:43,207
- I'm looking...
- For more. I feel I can change.

968
01:06:43,368 --> 01:06:45,767
- I absolutely can change.
- I need to change.

969
01:06:45,928 --> 01:06:48,048
I can't believe I fell for it again.

970
01:06:48,207 --> 01:06:50,888
Daniel, I really do think

971
01:06:51,048 --> 01:06:53,728
that you should go and fuck yourself.

972
01:06:53,888 --> 01:06:57,609
Or her. But definitely not me.

973
01:06:57,769 --> 01:06:59,249
- # Think
- # Think

974
01:06:59,409 --> 01:07:01,729
# Think about
what you're trying to do to me

975
01:07:01,889 --> 01:07:03,409
- # Think
- # Think think

976
01:07:03,569 --> 01:07:04,729
# Let your mind go...

977
01:07:04,889 --> 01:07:07,449
I can't believe he made up
the sex therapy thing.

978
01:07:07,609 --> 01:07:09,970
Doesn't matter.
I finally learnt my lesson,

979
01:07:10,130 --> 01:07:12,810
and it's an excellent lesson
to have nailed.

980
01:07:13,449 --> 01:07:14,970
- Fuck!
- What?

981
01:07:15,130 --> 01:07:17,411
No fucking room in the fucking suitcase.

982
01:07:17,570 --> 01:07:19,890
There's room in mine. Give me something.

983
01:07:20,050 --> 01:07:21,771
Great.

984
01:07:21,931 --> 01:07:25,250
- What the hell is this?
- It is a fertility-snake bowl.

985
01:07:25,411 --> 01:07:27,731
- Ooh.
- Jed gave it to me.

986
01:07:27,891 --> 01:07:29,811
- # Think think
- # Let your mind go...

987
01:07:29,971 --> 01:07:31,331
How romantic.

988
01:07:31,491 --> 01:07:32,612
# Freedom...

989
01:07:32,772 --> 01:07:36,812
The way I look at it, in everyone's
life, there's a certain amount of shit.

990
01:07:36,972 --> 01:07:39,412
- That's true.
- In the last year,

991
01:07:39,572 --> 01:07:41,973
things have turned out pretty shitty.

992
01:07:42,132 --> 01:07:44,212
So logically, mathematically, even,

993
01:07:44,372 --> 01:07:47,212
it's got to be time
for something not shit.

994
01:07:47,373 --> 01:07:51,973
- Like what?
- Maybe Mark will have chucked Rebecca.

995
01:07:52,133 --> 01:07:54,454
And he'll run to my door,

996
01:07:54,613 --> 01:07:58,733
fall to his knees,
possibly wearing a wet white shirt,

997
01:07:58,894 --> 01:08:00,694
and beg me to come back.

998
01:08:00,854 --> 01:08:02,054
- # Think
- # Think

999
01:08:02,214 --> 01:08:04,934
# Think about
what you're tryin' to do to me...

1000
01:08:05,094 --> 01:08:10,414
Yes, I very confidently expect
very, very good times ahead.

1001
01:08:10,575 --> 01:08:13,135
Final call
for all passengers to London...

1002
01:08:13,295 --> 01:08:16,175
Isn't he cute? Hello.

1003
01:08:16,655 --> 01:08:18,176
Hello. Oh...

1004
01:08:18,335 --> 01:08:21,215
Seems to be getting a bit excited.

1005
01:08:21,816 --> 01:08:23,295
Oh.

1006
01:08:23,456 --> 01:08:24,856
Er...

1007
01:08:26,136 --> 01:08:29,256
- Bridget!
- It's just a misunderstanding.

1008
01:08:29,417 --> 01:08:31,057
Hold the plane.

1009
01:08:31,217 --> 01:08:32,977
Hold the plane.

1010
01:08:33,137 --> 01:08:35,177
Excuse me! Excuse me!

1011
01:08:35,336 --> 01:08:39,977
All remaining passengers
please report to Gate 27 immediately.

1012
01:08:47,697 --> 01:08:49,618
It's not mine.

1013
01:08:49,778 --> 01:08:52,138
- These yours?
- Yes.

1014
01:08:52,298 --> 01:08:54,418
I mean, they're not my favorite pair.

1015
01:09:06,419 --> 01:09:08,380
You can't do this. I'm English.

1016
01:09:08,539 --> 01:09:10,660
And an award-winning journalist.

1017
01:09:10,820 --> 01:09:15,140
Well, maybe not award-winning, but I
have been to lots of award ceremonies.

1018
01:09:23,941 --> 01:09:26,781
Hello. Bridget Jones.

1019
01:09:29,261 --> 01:09:31,341
Lovely to meet all of you.

1020
01:09:33,462 --> 01:09:35,822
Oh, my bloody God and fuck.

1021
01:09:35,981 --> 01:09:38,462
I hope they've told
the British ambassador.

1022
01:09:38,622 --> 01:09:41,182
Surely Shazzer
would have raised the alert.

1023
01:09:41,342 --> 01:09:43,503
Maybe they got Shazzer as well.

1024
01:09:50,263 --> 01:09:53,143
Oh, God, 28 hours.

1025
01:09:53,983 --> 01:09:55,863
How much longer?

1026
01:09:56,023 --> 01:09:58,743
Jones.
Bridget Jones, you come now.

1027
01:10:07,464 --> 01:10:10,505
Charlie Parker-Knowles,
Assistant Consul.

1028
01:10:10,665 --> 01:10:12,825
Thank God you're here.

1029
01:10:14,505 --> 01:10:16,265
Um, shall we...

1030
01:10:16,426 --> 01:10:19,426
I really had absolutely
nothing to do with it.

1031
01:10:19,586 --> 01:10:21,506
Jed planned the whole thing.

1032
01:10:21,665 --> 01:10:24,626
That's why he snogged Shazzer,
who's much older than him

1033
01:10:24,786 --> 01:10:26,706
and slightly past her peak.

1034
01:10:26,866 --> 01:10:29,307
Yes, he sounds the most frightful shit.

1035
01:10:29,466 --> 01:10:30,706
Mmm.

1036
01:10:30,866 --> 01:10:35,187
The bore is everyone who gets caught
has exactly the same story,

1037
01:10:35,347 --> 01:10:39,947
so unless we find this, this Jed fellow
and get a full confession,

1038
01:10:40,107 --> 01:10:42,147
you're on a bit of a sticky wicket.

1039
01:10:42,748 --> 01:10:44,587
Well, how sticky?

1040
01:10:44,747 --> 01:10:46,988
Something like 15 to 20 years.

1041
01:10:47,148 --> 01:10:50,588
- 15 years?
- Or maybe ten if we're lucky.

1042
01:10:50,748 --> 01:10:52,668
Ten years!

1043
01:10:52,828 --> 01:10:55,109
In here?

1044
01:11:07,189 --> 01:11:09,230
Very black.

1045
01:11:09,389 --> 01:11:13,390
All my life I've had the feeling
something terrible was about to happen.

1046
01:11:14,150 --> 01:11:16,270
Now it has.

1047
01:11:18,350 --> 01:11:20,270
Bijjit, right?

1048
01:11:20,431 --> 01:11:22,310
Bridget, actually.

1049
01:11:22,471 --> 01:11:24,231
My name Phrao.

1050
01:11:24,391 --> 01:11:26,311
You're my friend?

1051
01:11:32,311 --> 01:11:34,312
- Steady on!
- Superbra!

1052
01:11:34,472 --> 01:11:37,552
You lend me. One day, two cigarette.

1053
01:11:38,352 --> 01:11:40,232
Oh.

1054
01:11:40,392 --> 01:11:42,553
Well, I'll think about it.

1055
01:11:43,353 --> 01:11:45,593
Actually, I was thinking of giving up,

1056
01:11:45,752 --> 01:11:49,073
but that was before I was arrested
and thrown into a Thai prison

1057
01:11:49,233 --> 01:11:51,753
for ten to 15 years.

1058
01:11:52,314 --> 01:11:54,474
Circumstances change.

1059
01:11:56,353 --> 01:11:59,514
No, it really, really is "touched".

1060
01:12:00,074 --> 01:12:04,515
"Like a vir-gin,
touched for the very first time".

1061
01:12:04,674 --> 01:12:06,155
- No, you wrong.
- No.

1062
01:12:06,314 --> 01:12:08,195
# Like a wersion

1063
01:12:08,355 --> 01:12:11,114
- Vir-gin.
- # Fucked for the very first time

1064
01:12:11,274 --> 01:12:14,835
- Touched.
- # Like a wersion

1065
01:12:14,995 --> 01:12:17,075
Ten years of this? I

1066
01:12:17,235 --> 01:12:19,955
Stop! Enough. Enough.

1067
01:12:20,116 --> 01:12:23,755
If you're going to do it,
you really ought to do it properly.

1068
01:12:24,356 --> 01:12:29,556
After all, Madonna is nothing
if not a perfectionist.

1069
01:12:29,716 --> 01:12:31,996
Five, six, seven, eight and one...

1070
01:12:32,156 --> 01:12:34,357
# Like a virgin

1071
01:12:35,276 --> 01:12:39,117
# Touched for the very first time

1072
01:12:39,477 --> 01:12:43,198
# Like a virgin

1073
01:12:43,357 --> 01:12:45,878
# When your heart beats

1074
01:12:46,038 --> 01:12:48,758
# Next to mine...

1075
01:12:52,958 --> 01:12:54,918
Dear Mum and Dad,

1076
01:12:55,078 --> 01:12:56,999
I'm missing you a lot.

1077
01:12:57,159 --> 01:12:59,479
Please write as soon as you can.

1078
01:13:01,959 --> 01:13:04,119
I'm feeling pretty low.

1079
01:13:05,319 --> 01:13:07,279
Bijjit Jone.

1080
01:13:10,640 --> 01:13:13,080
In there. You have five minutes.

1081
01:13:13,240 --> 01:13:14,960
Just five.

1082
01:13:22,760 --> 01:13:24,201
Mark?

1083
01:13:28,841 --> 01:13:30,761
You all right?

1084
01:13:30,922 --> 01:13:33,362
Oh... Fine.

1085
01:13:33,522 --> 01:13:35,162
Hmm.

1086
01:13:40,082 --> 01:13:42,922
And... scared shitless.

1087
01:13:43,082 --> 01:13:45,043
But, you know, perky.

1088
01:13:47,603 --> 01:13:50,003
I can't believe
you've come all this way.

1089
01:13:50,163 --> 01:13:53,403
I haven't. I was out here
handling a Foreign Office case

1090
01:13:53,564 --> 01:13:55,484
when I heard about your situation.

1091
01:13:55,643 --> 01:13:58,044
I haven't done anything wrong.

1092
01:13:58,204 --> 01:14:00,723
I promise you, it's all a big mistake.

1093
01:14:00,884 --> 01:14:03,284
Yes, well, I'm sure it is.

1094
01:14:03,444 --> 01:14:06,484
I've got all the papers here
and I'm sure we can sort it out.

1095
01:14:06,644 --> 01:14:10,965
I think about you all the time.
And I'm so sorry,

1096
01:14:11,125 --> 01:14:15,285
I really, really am,
for everything that happened between us.

1097
01:14:15,445 --> 01:14:17,405
Yes, well...

1098
01:14:17,566 --> 01:14:21,246
We don't have much time and I need you
to identify someone for me.

1099
01:14:21,406 --> 01:14:25,206
Is this the man with whom you were
seen taking hallucinogenic mushrooms

1100
01:14:25,366 --> 01:14:27,926
before you spent the night
with Daniel Cleaver?

1101
01:14:28,086 --> 01:14:30,727
Yes, that's him,
but I think you should know...

1102
01:14:30,887 --> 01:14:33,926
The same man who gave you
the snake containing the drugs?

1103
01:14:34,086 --> 01:14:36,407
Yes, that's him, that's Jed.

1104
01:14:36,567 --> 01:14:38,567
But it was Shazzer's snake, not mine,

1105
01:14:38,727 --> 01:14:40,927
and as far as Daniel Cleaver goes...

1106
01:14:41,087 --> 01:14:44,087
Your sex life doesn't concern me at all.

1107
01:14:54,928 --> 01:14:57,368
Has there been any ill treatment here?

1108
01:14:57,928 --> 01:15:01,409
No, no. Well, I mean...

1109
01:15:02,009 --> 01:15:04,729
...the toilet facilities
are well below par, but...

1110
01:15:04,889 --> 01:15:06,810
Good, that makes things simpler.

1111
01:15:10,210 --> 01:15:13,289
Listen, they're prepared
to drop all charges against you

1112
01:15:13,450 --> 01:15:16,810
which is extremely lenient,
given the circumstances.

1113
01:15:16,971 --> 01:15:19,411
You're going to be out within a week.

1114
01:15:23,131 --> 01:15:24,571
And...

1115
01:15:31,892 --> 01:15:33,652
Goodbye.

1116
01:15:38,052 --> 01:15:39,452
Mark?

1117
01:15:49,573 --> 01:15:51,373
Thank you.

1118
01:15:51,973 --> 01:15:55,813
You're welcome. I'm just the messenger.
The order came from above.

1119
01:15:57,773 --> 01:16:00,493
Well, good luck.
Glad I could be of help.

1120
01:16:22,256 --> 01:16:24,215
So, Bijjit, what happen?

1121
01:16:24,376 --> 01:16:26,416
Well, um...

1122
01:16:27,376 --> 01:16:29,576
Bijjit! How this can happen?

1123
01:16:29,736 --> 01:16:32,736
This is terrible! You are innocent!

1124
01:16:32,896 --> 01:16:36,457
- They're always cheating us.
- No, no, no. That's all fine.

1125
01:16:36,617 --> 01:16:39,937
They've dropped the charges
and they're letting me go.

1126
01:16:40,097 --> 01:16:41,977
But that good news.

1127
01:16:42,138 --> 01:16:44,137
What is wrong?

1128
01:16:45,217 --> 01:16:47,898
Mark Darcy definitely...

1129
01:16:48,058 --> 01:16:50,537
...doesn't love me anymore.

1130
01:16:50,698 --> 01:16:52,458
Ohhh.

1131
01:16:53,098 --> 01:16:55,739
You see the trouble is
it was me who chucked him.

1132
01:16:55,898 --> 01:16:57,939
He treat you bad?

1133
01:16:58,098 --> 01:17:00,018
Yeah, actually, he did.

1134
01:17:00,179 --> 01:17:02,419
My boyfriend treat me bad too.

1135
01:17:02,579 --> 01:17:04,139
- Me too.
- Mine as well.

1136
01:17:04,299 --> 01:17:05,659
Me too.

1137
01:17:05,819 --> 01:17:09,180
Then you know all about it.
You think you've found the right man,

1138
01:17:09,339 --> 01:17:11,659
but then there's so much wrong with him

1139
01:17:11,819 --> 01:17:15,900
and he finds there's so much wrong
with you and it all just falls apart.

1140
01:17:16,060 --> 01:17:18,380
Don't tell me. My boyfriend,

1141
01:17:18,540 --> 01:17:20,460
he seem really nice.

1142
01:17:20,620 --> 01:17:24,541
Then he start to hit me.
Make me work on street.

1143
01:17:24,700 --> 01:17:27,021
My boyfriend, he say he love me.

1144
01:17:27,181 --> 01:17:30,821
But he do no work,
and make me work 24 hour a day.

1145
01:17:30,982 --> 01:17:33,061
Then he make me take heroin drug.

1146
01:17:33,221 --> 01:17:36,742
What about you, Bijjit?
What your bad boyfriend do?

1147
01:17:38,141 --> 01:17:40,102
Well, er...

1148
01:17:40,902 --> 01:17:44,582
...he really didn't stick up for me
at this lawyers' supper...

1149
01:17:44,742 --> 01:17:49,103
and, um, then he would fold his...

1150
01:17:50,823 --> 01:17:53,663
Oh, same sort of thing, really.

1151
01:17:53,823 --> 01:17:58,664
Hitting me and making me take drugs.
Stealing all my money and stuff.

1152
01:17:59,143 --> 01:18:03,464
Oh, God.
I've been the world's biggest fool.

1153
01:18:09,225 --> 01:18:10,985
Bijjit?

1154
01:18:11,904 --> 01:18:14,705
Just a few tiny leaving presents.
No luxuries.

1155
01:18:18,345 --> 01:18:20,705
# Living in a material world

1156
01:18:20,865 --> 01:18:23,066
# And I am a material girl

1157
01:18:23,226 --> 01:18:27,426
# You know that we are living
in a material world

1158
01:18:27,586 --> 01:18:29,946
# And I am a material girl

1159
01:18:31,187 --> 01:18:34,227
# Living in a material world

1160
01:18:34,386 --> 01:18:37,266
# And I am a material girl #

1161
01:18:38,587 --> 01:18:40,787
If you want something smooth
on your wall,

1162
01:18:40,948 --> 01:18:42,868
you could do worse than John Currin.

1163
01:18:43,027 --> 01:18:46,067
He is about the only
contemporary painter who can paint.

1164
01:18:46,227 --> 01:18:49,388
There's usually something
interesting and allegorical,

1165
01:18:49,548 --> 01:18:52,428
plus of course,
there is a very high perv quotient.

1166
01:18:52,588 --> 01:18:54,908
- Did you see her?
- Out. Out it.

1167
01:18:55,069 --> 01:18:57,389
Sorry, everyone, sorry. It's my stalker.

1168
01:18:58,589 --> 01:19:00,988
Fuck off, Darcy,
some people have jobs to do.

1169
01:19:01,789 --> 01:19:05,349
Did you see her surrounded by police,
dogs, handcuffs?

1170
01:19:05,510 --> 01:19:08,869
Come on, she's a big girl,
she can take care of herself.

1171
01:19:09,030 --> 01:19:12,310
I'm only going to ask you one more time.
Did you see her?

1172
01:19:12,470 --> 01:19:14,790
You're only gonna ask me one more time?

1173
01:19:14,990 --> 01:19:18,430
- You haven't got your wig on now, dear.
- I'll take that as a yes.

1174
01:19:18,590 --> 01:19:20,750
Yes, I did see her.

1175
01:19:20,910 --> 01:19:24,231
I thought she was smuggling seashells,
or mangoes.

1176
01:19:24,391 --> 01:19:25,711
Right.

1177
01:19:25,871 --> 01:19:30,031
Right, good.
Will you step outside, please?

1178
01:19:30,192 --> 01:19:32,352
Oh, no, it's not possible.

1179
01:19:32,512 --> 01:19:35,912
Darcy, do you have any idea
what century we actually live in?

1180
01:19:36,072 --> 01:19:39,352
Are you gonna step outside
or am I gonna have to drag you?

1181
01:19:39,512 --> 01:19:41,713
I think you're gonna have to drag me.

1182
01:19:46,952 --> 01:19:50,353
- You're insane!
- And you're a disgrace, Cleaver.

1183
01:19:50,953 --> 01:19:53,073
You're pulling my hair!

1184
01:19:53,234 --> 01:19:56,313
I'm not going in the sodding water.

1185
01:19:59,634 --> 01:20:03,594
# Touching you
'Cause you're touching me

1186
01:20:05,794 --> 01:20:07,475
# I believe in a thing called love

1187
01:20:07,635 --> 01:20:09,515
# Just listen to the rhythm of my heart

1188
01:20:09,675 --> 01:20:11,114
# There's a chance we can make it now

1189
01:20:11,275 --> 01:20:13,115
# We'll be rockin'
till the sun goes down

1190
01:20:13,275 --> 01:20:16,395
# I believe in a thing called love

1191
01:20:16,555 --> 01:20:18,995
# Oooh-ooh ooh...

1192
01:20:19,156 --> 01:20:21,675
- Fuck off!
- No, you're going in, Cleaver!

1193
01:20:21,835 --> 01:20:24,516
If I'm going in, you're coming with me.

1194
01:20:24,675 --> 01:20:26,476
You smug bastard.

1195
01:20:28,637 --> 01:20:30,796
- Oh, my God.
- Get up.

1196
01:20:34,397 --> 01:20:36,317
Well, what are you gonna do now?

1197
01:20:36,476 --> 01:20:38,797
Drown me in 16 inches of water?

1198
01:20:38,957 --> 01:20:40,677
Yes, good idea.

1199
01:20:46,958 --> 01:20:48,518
Fuck! Stop, stop.

1200
01:20:48,677 --> 01:20:50,678
Listen, listen, listen...

1201
01:20:50,838 --> 01:20:54,998
OK, I left her at the airport.
I shouldn't have done that.

1202
01:20:55,958 --> 01:20:58,038
But she bumped into Jed herself

1203
01:20:58,199 --> 01:21:00,919
and I didn't fucking well seduce her,
all right?

1204
01:21:02,079 --> 01:21:04,679
- You didn't?
- There's something wrong with her.

1205
01:21:04,839 --> 01:21:06,599
She's gone all frigid.

1206
01:21:06,760 --> 01:21:09,039
I spent the night
with a gorgeous Thai girl.

1207
01:21:09,200 --> 01:21:11,920
Who in fact turned out to be
a gorgeous Thai boy.

1208
01:21:12,600 --> 01:21:14,000
Satisfied?

1209
01:21:16,600 --> 01:21:18,200
Yes.

1210
01:21:18,360 --> 01:21:19,880
Thank you.

1211
01:21:24,360 --> 01:21:26,281
You know what, mate?

1212
01:21:26,881 --> 01:21:30,882
If you're so obsessed with Bridget
Jones, why don't you just marry her?

1213
01:21:32,562 --> 01:21:34,882
'Cause then she'd definitely shag me.

1214
01:21:36,602 --> 01:21:38,162
# I believe in a thing called love

1215
01:21:38,322 --> 01:21:40,002
# Just listen to the rhythm of my heart

1216
01:21:40,162 --> 01:21:43,402
# I believe in a thing called love #

1217
01:21:44,483 --> 01:21:47,163
- Bridget!
- Bridget! Over here!

1218
01:21:48,563 --> 01:21:50,843
- What was it like?
- How did you survive?

1219
01:21:51,003 --> 01:21:55,203
Any girl who's been single in London
knows how to handle herself.

1220
01:21:55,363 --> 01:21:57,884
- Darling!
- Will you be going back?

1221
01:21:58,044 --> 01:22:00,644
Sorry I didn't write.
I've just been so busy.

1222
01:22:00,804 --> 01:22:03,644
Hello, darling. You look lovely.

1223
01:22:03,804 --> 01:22:06,484
- Skinny, but lovely.
- Oh, thank you.

1224
01:22:06,644 --> 01:22:09,644
Oh, it's good to be home.

1225
01:22:09,805 --> 01:22:12,125
- Ciggy?
- No, no, thanks.

1226
01:22:12,285 --> 01:22:15,365
- I've given up again.
- Shame. I find them very useful.

1227
01:22:15,525 --> 01:22:19,565
I take great comfort in the fact they
might kill me before things get worse.

1228
01:22:27,646 --> 01:22:30,726
The Darcys rang to say how pleased
they were you were out.

1229
01:22:31,527 --> 01:22:34,247
I rather thought Mark might be here
to meet you.

1230
01:22:34,407 --> 01:22:36,807
Yes, but you must remember we split up.

1231
01:22:36,967 --> 01:22:39,167
So no hope there?

1232
01:22:39,327 --> 01:22:41,247
No hope there.

1233
01:22:41,408 --> 01:22:46,247
Believe me,
next time I will not fuck it up, Mum.

1234
01:22:46,407 --> 01:22:48,528
- Language, darling.
- Sorry.

1235
01:22:49,608 --> 01:22:53,048
Next time, I will not fuck it up...

1236
01:22:53,648 --> 01:22:55,888
...Mother.

1237
01:22:58,369 --> 01:23:00,489
# Trying to be misunderstood

1238
01:23:04,809 --> 01:23:08,329
# But it doesn't do me any good

1239
01:23:12,569 --> 01:23:16,170
# Love the way they smiled at me

1240
01:23:16,330 --> 01:23:19,730
# Hold that face for eternity

1241
01:23:20,491 --> 01:23:24,331
# Now let them all fly off

1242
01:23:27,331 --> 01:23:30,331
# When it comes down

1243
01:23:30,851 --> 01:23:34,452
# It all comes down

1244
01:23:35,732 --> 01:23:39,372
# And you will not be found

1245
01:23:42,612 --> 01:23:45,613
# When it's over

1246
01:23:46,172 --> 01:23:49,253
# It's all over

1247
01:23:51,173 --> 01:23:54,333
# Even if I make a sound...

1248
01:24:01,214 --> 01:24:02,814
Surprise!

1249
01:24:02,974 --> 01:24:04,814
- Hello.
- Hello.

1250
01:24:04,974 --> 01:24:06,894
- Oh, darling.
- Hiya.

1251
01:24:07,574 --> 01:24:09,014
Bridget...

1252
01:24:09,175 --> 01:24:11,055
I'm so sorry.

1253
01:24:12,575 --> 01:24:14,695
It's all right.

1254
01:24:18,095 --> 01:24:21,895
Well, thank God for Mark Darcy.
I mean, he might be a boring arse,

1255
01:24:22,056 --> 01:24:24,096
but he performed a miracle.

1256
01:24:25,336 --> 01:24:27,736
That's a bit of an overstatement.

1257
01:24:28,376 --> 01:24:30,976
He actually seems
to be the villain of this piece.

1258
01:24:31,576 --> 01:24:36,217
He's a top human rights lawyer and he
left it to someone else to get me out.

1259
01:24:36,376 --> 01:24:38,417
He was just a messenger.

1260
01:24:39,377 --> 01:24:42,097
- Who told you that?
- He did.

1261
01:24:42,258 --> 01:24:44,257
Straight from the horse's mouth.

1262
01:24:45,098 --> 01:24:47,738
The horse wasn't quite
telling you the truth.

1263
01:24:47,898 --> 01:24:50,218
I called Mark
the minute I landed in London.

1264
01:24:50,377 --> 01:24:52,738
We went to his office
and within half an hour,

1265
01:24:52,898 --> 01:24:55,778
he'd woken two Cabinet ministers
and half of Ml5.

1266
01:24:55,938 --> 01:24:59,858
But none of them could locate Jed,
so Mark flew over to Interpol.

1267
01:25:00,019 --> 01:25:02,299
Which is in Lyon.
They located Jed in Dubai,

1268
01:25:02,459 --> 01:25:04,979
but they don't normally
extradite people,

1269
01:25:05,139 --> 01:25:08,379
so Mark rang the Home Secretary
who rang our ambassador...

1270
01:25:08,539 --> 01:25:11,700
In Riyadh. Then Mark flew to Dubai
where he identified Jed,

1271
01:25:11,860 --> 01:25:14,140
who was impounded and pushed out into...

1272
01:25:14,300 --> 01:25:17,180
Saudi Arabia, where Mark was waiting
with the police.

1273
01:25:17,340 --> 01:25:21,581
Jed was arrested and extradited back
to Britain. Then Mark flew to Bangkok,

1274
01:25:21,741 --> 01:25:24,741
to make damn sure they'd let you go.

1275
01:25:25,621 --> 01:25:27,181
Oh.

1276
01:25:31,261 --> 01:25:33,901
He was just angry about Daniel Cleaver.

1277
01:25:36,502 --> 01:25:39,382
- He must still love me.
- He fucking must.

1278
01:25:39,942 --> 01:25:41,663
Taxi?

1279
01:25:41,822 --> 01:25:43,102
Yes, please.

1280
01:25:47,062 --> 01:25:49,183
Get in the cab!

1281
01:25:52,703 --> 01:25:54,303
Hurry!

1282
01:26:17,625 --> 01:26:21,225
Oh. I forgot about you.

1283
01:26:22,266 --> 01:26:25,146
Er, I, I, I just wanted to, um...

1284
01:26:25,305 --> 01:26:27,346
say something to Mark.

1285
01:26:27,506 --> 01:26:29,786
He's at the office.
Do you want to come in?

1286
01:26:31,027 --> 01:26:34,266
Oh, no. No, no, I don't think I will.

1287
01:26:35,547 --> 01:26:38,827
I really hope
that you'll be happy together.

1288
01:26:38,987 --> 01:26:41,027
- Sorry?
- You and Mark.

1289
01:26:41,187 --> 01:26:44,988
I really hope that you'll be
very happy together.

1290
01:26:45,148 --> 01:26:47,147
No, no, no, Bridget, listen...

1291
01:26:47,308 --> 01:26:49,628
you've got it completely wrong.

1292
01:26:49,788 --> 01:26:51,988
I'm not in love with him.

1293
01:26:52,148 --> 01:26:54,349
How could I be when I'm...

1294
01:26:54,509 --> 01:26:57,548
seriously heartbroken
and smitten with someone else?

1295
01:26:58,829 --> 01:27:00,828
Someone else?

1296
01:27:00,989 --> 01:27:03,669
- You, Bridget.
- Me?

1297
01:27:04,269 --> 01:27:07,749
Ever since I saw you here
with your hair messed that night

1298
01:27:07,910 --> 01:27:10,749
and bits of garden stuck to you.
You must have noticed.

1299
01:27:10,910 --> 01:27:15,030
I try to hide it,
but every time I see you, I light up.

1300
01:27:17,110 --> 01:27:19,390
I thought you were just, you know...

1301
01:27:20,391 --> 01:27:21,550
...lying.

1302
01:27:21,710 --> 01:27:23,791
Was every look I ever gave you a lie?

1303
01:27:23,951 --> 01:27:25,631
I've been looking forward to this.

1304
01:27:25,790 --> 01:27:28,031
Lovely to see you, Bridget.

1305
01:27:45,312 --> 01:27:47,393
Thank you very much.

1306
01:27:48,832 --> 01:27:50,873
That was lovely.

1307
01:27:52,153 --> 01:27:53,913
Really lovely.

1308
01:27:54,073 --> 01:27:56,513
But I'm afraid it's still men
in general,

1309
01:27:56,673 --> 01:28:00,354
and Mark Darcy in particular,
that I love.

1310
01:28:00,754 --> 01:28:02,034
Right.

1311
01:28:03,914 --> 01:28:07,714
If, er, if I ever do decide to, um...

1312
01:28:08,194 --> 01:28:10,915
you know, bat for the other side...

1313
01:28:12,235 --> 01:28:14,555
...well, there's no-one else.

1314
01:28:15,195 --> 01:28:16,515
Only you.

1315
01:28:23,996 --> 01:28:26,636
- Hello, Giles.
- Hello, Bridget.

1316
01:28:28,236 --> 01:28:30,276
# Open up your eyes

1317
01:28:30,436 --> 01:28:32,076
# Then you'll realize

1318
01:28:32,236 --> 01:28:33,876
# Here I stand with my

1319
01:28:34,037 --> 01:28:35,877
# Everlasting love

1320
01:28:36,036 --> 01:28:37,837
# Need you by my side

1321
01:28:37,997 --> 01:28:39,637
# Girl, to be my bride

1322
01:28:39,797 --> 01:28:41,397
# You'll never be denied...

1323
01:28:41,557 --> 01:28:44,037
Inns of Court, please. Fast as you can.

1324
01:28:48,038 --> 01:28:50,558
What do you think of this jacket?

1325
01:28:50,718 --> 01:28:53,238
- Yeah, very nice indeed.
- No, be honest.

1326
01:28:53,398 --> 01:28:56,638
What do you think of the whole
jacket/trouser combination?

1327
01:28:57,198 --> 01:29:01,039
- Disaster.
- Actually, can we take a tiny detour?

1328
01:29:01,999 --> 01:29:04,639
I'll be back in literally two seconds.

1329
01:29:06,279 --> 01:29:08,319
# Where life really flows

1330
01:29:08,480 --> 01:29:09,959
# No-one really knows

1331
01:29:10,120 --> 01:29:11,640
# Till someone's there to show

1332
01:29:11,800 --> 01:29:13,479
# The way to lasting love

1333
01:29:13,640 --> 01:29:17,000
# Need a love to last forever

1334
01:29:17,441 --> 01:29:20,680
# Need a love to last forever...

1335
01:29:26,521 --> 01:29:28,201
Oh.

1336
01:29:39,322 --> 01:29:40,922
# You're the first

1337
01:29:41,082 --> 01:29:42,722
# The last

1338
01:29:42,882 --> 01:29:44,762
# My everything

1339
01:29:46,323 --> 01:29:48,443
# And the answer to

1340
01:29:49,162 --> 01:29:51,243
# All my dreams

1341
01:29:53,603 --> 01:29:55,123
# You're my sun

1342
01:29:55,284 --> 01:29:56,764
# My moon

1343
01:29:58,243 --> 01:30:00,003
# My guiding star

1344
01:30:01,564 --> 01:30:03,884
# My kind of wonderful

1345
01:30:05,164 --> 01:30:06,884
# That's what you are...

1346
01:30:08,244 --> 01:30:10,605
- You look gorgeous.
- Thank you.

1347
01:30:10,765 --> 01:30:13,284
Very important at this moment.

1348
01:30:14,965 --> 01:30:17,085
# There's no way

1349
01:30:17,485 --> 01:30:19,805
# They could have made two...

1350
01:30:21,005 --> 01:30:23,165
Doesn't matter. It's not about looks.

1351
01:30:25,726 --> 01:30:29,126
- # Your love I'll keep for evermore
- As I was saying.

1352
01:30:29,286 --> 01:30:30,606
# You're the first...

1353
01:30:31,246 --> 01:30:34,286
Excuse me, I'm looking for Mr. Darcy.

1354
01:30:34,446 --> 01:30:37,566
Down there, right along the corridor,
and just to the left.

1355
01:30:37,727 --> 01:30:39,447
Thank you very much.

1356
01:30:48,848 --> 01:30:51,368
# Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh no no

1357
01:30:51,528 --> 01:30:53,488
# Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh no no

1358
01:30:53,648 --> 01:30:55,769
# Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh no no

1359
01:30:55,929 --> 01:30:58,008
# Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh no no...

1360
01:30:59,528 --> 01:31:02,289
I love you.
I always have and I always will.

1361
01:31:05,169 --> 01:31:07,209
Oh, um...

1362
01:31:07,369 --> 01:31:10,570
I don't love you,
and I never have, and...

1363
01:31:11,130 --> 01:31:13,570
...I never will. Sorry.

1364
01:31:23,410 --> 01:31:25,131
Come in.

1365
01:31:30,451 --> 01:31:32,491
Hello, Bridget.

1366
01:31:32,652 --> 01:31:34,572
Hello, Mark.

1367
01:31:35,092 --> 01:31:36,852
Er...

1368
01:31:37,532 --> 01:31:39,412
I'm sorry, I'm disturbing you.

1369
01:31:41,532 --> 01:31:44,292
- Well, yes, a bit.
- I'll just...

1370
01:31:44,453 --> 01:31:46,572
sit outside while you finish.

1371
01:31:46,732 --> 01:31:50,933
No, no, no, please,
say what you have to say, young lady.

1372
01:31:51,893 --> 01:31:55,093
Mr. Santiago
is the Peruvian Secretary for Trade.

1373
01:31:55,693 --> 01:31:57,894
And Mr. Hernández is his number two.

1374
01:31:58,933 --> 01:32:00,894
Hello.

1375
01:32:01,054 --> 01:32:02,534
Hello.

1376
01:32:03,293 --> 01:32:05,334
Hello, hello, hello.

1377
01:32:09,614 --> 01:32:11,855
How can we help you, young lady?

1378
01:32:12,935 --> 01:32:14,615
Well, er...

1379
01:32:15,695 --> 01:32:17,655
Er...

1380
01:32:17,816 --> 01:32:20,455
I just wanted to tell Mr. Darcy here

1381
01:32:20,615 --> 01:32:25,296
that I heard what magnificent work

1382
01:32:25,456 --> 01:32:28,336
he actually did
releasing me from prison.

1383
01:32:30,656 --> 01:32:36,417
Tiny, tiny misunderstanding to do
with an enormous stash of cocaine.

1384
01:32:36,577 --> 01:32:39,137
And I also wanted to say,

1385
01:32:39,297 --> 01:32:43,338
since having found out that his
girlfriend is actually a lesbian...

1386
01:32:46,618 --> 01:32:48,297
...that I love him.

1387
01:32:51,298 --> 01:32:54,299
Always have. Always will.

1388
01:32:55,659 --> 01:32:58,419
And that I'm...

1389
01:32:59,499 --> 01:33:00,939
...you know...

1390
01:33:01,499 --> 01:33:03,459
...available for dates...

1391
01:33:04,059 --> 01:33:06,579
...if he should feel so inclined.

1392
01:33:10,980 --> 01:33:13,539
So, er, your girlfriend is a lesbian.

1393
01:33:14,780 --> 01:33:18,260
Look, if you'll all just excuse us
for a second...

1394
01:33:18,861 --> 01:33:20,580
I think we should...

1395
01:33:38,062 --> 01:33:41,782
Bridget, that was not the most romantic
proposition I've ever heard.

1396
01:33:42,742 --> 01:33:45,262
Well, maybe it is romantic

1397
01:33:45,422 --> 01:33:47,743
because it's not. I mean...

1398
01:33:47,903 --> 01:33:51,503
I know there's no music playing,
and it's not snowing,

1399
01:33:52,423 --> 01:33:57,743
but that doesn't mean that it,
that it can't really be something.

1400
01:33:59,903 --> 01:34:01,823
You're right.

1401
01:34:03,744 --> 01:34:06,704
In fact, there's a question
I've been meaning to ask you.

1402
01:34:06,865 --> 01:34:09,985
All right. As long as it's not
"Will you marry me?"

1403
01:34:16,425 --> 01:34:19,665
Oh, God.
It is "Will you marry me?"

1404
01:34:19,825 --> 01:34:22,066
Well, I'm not gonna say it now.

1405
01:34:22,226 --> 01:34:24,786
- Is it "Will you marry me?"
- The moment's gone.

1406
01:34:24,946 --> 01:34:27,066
No. No, no, no. No, wait.

1407
01:34:27,826 --> 01:34:29,386
Wait.

1408
01:34:29,546 --> 01:34:30,867
- Bridget.
- Start again.

1409
01:34:31,026 --> 01:34:32,986
- No.
- Start again.

1410
01:34:33,146 --> 01:34:35,067
I'm not gonna... It's...

1411
01:34:35,227 --> 01:34:38,587
We've just stepped out
into the corridor,

1412
01:34:38,747 --> 01:34:40,867
you say "I've got a question to ask you"

1413
01:34:41,027 --> 01:34:43,147
and I don't say anything.

1414
01:34:48,708 --> 01:34:50,868
And... And...

1415
01:34:51,908 --> 01:34:53,508
You say...

1416
01:35:01,348 --> 01:35:04,069
Bridget Jones, will you marry me?

1417
01:35:24,511 --> 01:35:28,191
Dearly beloved,
we are gathered here this day

1418
01:35:28,351 --> 01:35:30,911
to unite this couple.

1419
01:35:31,471 --> 01:35:34,431
Do you affirm your love,
one to the other?

1420
01:35:35,432 --> 01:35:37,632
I do. Again.

1421
01:35:37,792 --> 01:35:39,592
And Colin?

1422
01:35:39,751 --> 01:35:41,592
I do. Again.

1423
01:35:42,152 --> 01:35:44,192
As well. Of course.

1424
01:35:48,033 --> 01:35:51,753
# I've been really tryin', baby...

1425
01:35:53,633 --> 01:35:57,434
December 31st, year-end summary.

1426
01:35:57,593 --> 01:35:59,634
Prison stays, one.

1427
01:35:59,793 --> 01:36:02,434
Lesbian kisses, one.

1428
01:36:02,594 --> 01:36:04,874
Pounds lost, minus one.

1429
01:36:05,034 --> 01:36:09,355
Boyfriends lost but then regained
following major diplomatic incident,

1430
01:36:09,515 --> 01:36:11,515
one.

1431
01:36:11,675 --> 01:36:14,475
Marriage proposals, one.

1432
01:36:14,635 --> 01:36:17,035
An excellent year's progress.

1433
01:36:17,196 --> 01:36:21,996
Bridget Jones has cocked things up
for the very last time.

1434
01:36:27,316 --> 01:36:29,556
# Your love is king

1435
01:36:30,516 --> 01:36:32,557
# Crown you in my heart

1436
01:36:32,716 --> 01:36:34,676
# Your love is king

1437
01:36:35,637 --> 01:36:37,317
# Never need to part

1438
01:36:37,477 --> 01:36:39,877
# Your kisses ring

1439
01:36:40,757 --> 01:36:43,317
# Round and round and round my head

1440
01:36:43,477 --> 01:36:45,678
# Touching the very part of me

1441
01:36:45,838 --> 01:36:48,038
# It's making my soul sing

1442
01:36:48,198 --> 01:36:50,638
# Tearing the very heart of me

1443
01:36:50,798 --> 01:36:52,999
# I'm crying out for more

1444
01:36:53,158 --> 01:36:55,039
# Your love is king

1445
01:36:56,119 --> 01:36:57,958
# Crown you in my heart

1446
01:36:58,118 --> 01:37:00,239
# Your love is king...

1447
01:37:00,399 --> 01:37:05,199
So, as you can see,
I have found my happy ending at last.

1448
01:37:05,359 --> 01:37:10,280
And I truly believe
that happiness is possible.

1449
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:17,000
Even when you're 33 and have a bottom
the size of two bowling balls.

1450
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:19,426
# Your love is real #

1451
01:37:32,480 --> 01:37:34,898
# Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh no no

1452
01:37:35,058 --> 01:37:37,153
# Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh no no

1453
01:37:37,315 --> 01:37:39,531
# Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh no no

1454
01:37:39,692 --> 01:37:41,706
# Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh no no

1455
01:37:46,582 --> 01:37:48,959
# I look and stare so deep in your eyes

1456
01:37:49,120 --> 01:37:51,296
# Touch on you more and more every time

1457
01:37:51,457 --> 01:37:53,633
# When you leave
I'm begging you not to go

1458
01:37:53,794 --> 01:37:55,889
# Call your name
two, three times in a row

1459
01:37:56,051 --> 01:37:58,266
# Such a funny thing for me
to try to explain

1460
01:37:58,427 --> 01:38:00,966
# How I'm feeling
and my pride is the one to blame

1461
01:38:01,127 --> 01:38:03,021
# 'Cause I know I don't understand

1462
01:38:03,182 --> 01:38:05,640
# Just how your love can do
what no-one else can

1463
01:38:05,801 --> 01:38:07,332
# Got me lookin' so crazy right now

1464
01:38:07,493 --> 01:38:09,548
# Your love's got me lookin’ so crazy
right now

1465
01:38:09,709 --> 01:38:11,844
# Your love's
Got me lookin’ so crazy right now

1466
01:38:12,006 --> 01:38:14,343
# Your touch got me lookin’ so crazy
right now

1467
01:38:14,504 --> 01:38:16,679
# Your love's
Got me hopin' you'll page me right now

1468
01:38:16,841 --> 01:38:19,178
# Your kiss got me hoping
you'll save me right now

1469
01:38:19,339 --> 01:38:21,273
# Lookin’ so crazy
Your love's got me lookin'

1470
01:38:21,434 --> 01:38:23,812
# Got me lookin’ so crazy in love

1471
01:38:24,133 --> 01:38:26,309
# Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh no no

1472
01:38:26,470 --> 01:38:28,647
# Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh no no

1473
01:38:28,807 --> 01:38:30,983
# Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh no no

1474
01:38:31,144 --> 01:38:33,320
# Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh no no...

1475
01:38:40,815 --> 01:38:43,393
# Hearts gone astray

1476
01:38:43,554 --> 01:38:46,818
# Deep in her when they go

1477
01:38:48,308 --> 01:38:50,524
# I went away

1478
01:38:50,686 --> 01:38:54,151
# Just when you needed me so

1479
01:38:55,682 --> 01:38:57,939
# You won't regret

1480
01:38:58,099 --> 01:39:01,443
# I'll come back begging you

1481
01:39:01,927 --> 01:39:02,975
# Hmm

1482
01:39:03,136 --> 01:39:05,029
# Won't you forget

1483
01:39:05,191 --> 01:39:11,154
# Welcome love we once knew

1484
01:39:12,726 --> 01:39:16,271
# Open up your eyes
Then you'll realize

1485
01:39:16,432 --> 01:39:19,696
# Here I stand with my everlasting love

1486
01:39:19,857 --> 01:39:23,483
# I need you by my side
Girl to be my pride

1487
01:39:23,645 --> 01:39:31,864
# You'll never be denied
everlasting love

1488
01:39:34,321 --> 01:39:36,820
# Hearts gone astray

1489
01:39:36,981 --> 01:39:40,204
# Deep in her when they go

1490
01:39:41,493 --> 01:39:43,790
# I went away

1491
01:39:44,314 --> 01:39:47,618
# Just when you needed me so

1492
01:39:48,947 --> 01:39:51,566
# You won't regret

1493
01:39:51,727 --> 01:39:55,192
# I'll come back begging you

1494
01:39:56,361 --> 01:39:58,537
# Won't you forget

# Welcome love we once knew

1496
01:40:06,152 --> 01:40:09,617
# Open up your eyes
Then you'll realize

01:40:09,779 --> 01:40:13,365
# Here I stand with my everlasting love

1498
01:40:13,525 --> 01:40:16,910
# Need you by my side
Girl to be my pride

1499
01:40:17,071 --> 01:40:20,455
# You'll never be denied
everlasting love

1500
01:40:20,617 --> 01:40:24,323
# From the very start
Open up your heart

1501
01:40:24,485 --> 01:40:34,719
# Feel that you fall in everlasting love

1502
01:40:34,880 --> 01:40:38,587
# Need a love to last forever

1503
01:40:38,748 --> 01:40:42,254
# Need a love to last forever

1504
01:40:42,414 --> 01:40:45,840
# Need a love to last forever

1505
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:58,411
# Need a love to last forever #

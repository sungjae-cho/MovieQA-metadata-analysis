1
00:01:32,859 --> 00:01:35,123
I wonder...

2
00:01:35,195 --> 00:01:37,959
Do we all know where we belong?

3
00:01:38,031 --> 00:01:41,967
And if we do, in our hearts,

4
00:01:42,035 --> 00:01:45,471
why do we so often
do nothing about it?

5
00:01:45,538 --> 00:01:47,972
There must be more
to this life--

6
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:52,273
a purpose for us all,
a place to belong.

7
00:01:54,047 --> 00:01:56,811
You were my home.

8
00:01:56,883 --> 00:02:00,080
I knew
from the moment I met you...

9
00:02:00,153 --> 00:02:03,554
that night, so many years ago.

10
00:02:05,558 --> 00:02:07,492
Well, come on and let me know

11
00:02:09,162 --> 00:02:11,255
Should I stay or should I go?

12
00:02:12,999 --> 00:02:16,491
Should I stay
or should I go now?

13
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:20,471
Should I stay
or should I go now?

14
00:02:21,508 --> 00:02:24,534
If I go, there will be trouble

15
00:02:25,612 --> 00:02:28,604
And if I stay,
it will be double

16
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:33,850
So come on and let me know...

17
00:02:47,867 --> 00:02:50,631
Thanks a lot.

18
00:03:01,414 --> 00:03:03,575
Should I stay
or should I go now?

19
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:04,617
Thank you.

20
00:03:05,652 --> 00:03:07,916
If I go,
there will be trouble

21
00:03:07,987 --> 00:03:09,249
Thank you.

22
00:03:09,322 --> 00:03:13,190
And if I stay,
it will be double

23
00:03:13,259 --> 00:03:16,194
So, you've got to let me know

24
00:03:17,497 --> 00:03:20,557
Should I stay or should I go?

25
00:03:20,633 --> 00:03:22,225
Thank you!

26
00:03:24,304 --> 00:03:26,499
Thank you very much.

27
00:03:34,647 --> 00:03:36,114
Lovely.

28
00:03:36,182 --> 00:03:37,479
I want to thank the band.

29
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:39,711
After that racket,
I can only appear good.

30
00:03:39,786 --> 00:03:41,117
Now, Margaret Thatcher...

31
00:03:41,187 --> 00:03:42,620
you've got to hand it to her.

32
00:03:42,689 --> 00:03:45,351
Love her or hate her,
Margaret Thatcher is definitely

33
00:03:45,425 --> 00:03:47,222
the strongest man
in the Tory Party.

34
00:03:47,293 --> 00:03:48,954
Charley!

35
00:03:49,028 --> 00:03:50,188
Hi, sis.

36
00:03:50,263 --> 00:03:51,457
Oh, you're freezing.

37
00:03:51,531 --> 00:03:53,465
I know... I couldn't get a cab--
God's punishment.

38
00:03:53,533 --> 00:03:54,830
You don't believe in God.

39
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:55,959
I know.
So that's Henry, huh?

40
00:03:56,035 --> 00:03:57,662
-Hm-mm.
-Very handsome.

41
00:03:57,737 --> 00:03:58,965
Hi, I'm Charlotte.

42
00:03:59,038 --> 00:04:00,369
How are you? Oh...

43
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,532
Oh, it's good to meet you.

44
00:04:01,608 --> 00:04:02,540
Likewise.

45
00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:03,701
I'm so sorry
I missed the wedding.

46
00:04:03,776 --> 00:04:04,708
No, no, no, no.

47
00:04:04,777 --> 00:04:05,675
I'm sure she's already told you,

48
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:07,110
I'm crap at appointments
and times and stuff.

49
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:08,112
Well, she did mention...

50
00:04:08,181 --> 00:04:09,409
Mind you, she
is absolutely nuts,

51
00:04:09,482 --> 00:04:11,211
but you married her,
so you must know, right?

52
00:04:12,452 --> 00:04:13,919
We should introduce you around.

53
00:04:13,987 --> 00:04:15,750
Come with me.

54
00:04:15,822 --> 00:04:18,848
Mom, Dad, may I introduce you
to Sarah's sister, Charlotte.

55
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:20,517
Yes, of course.

56
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:21,525
How do you do?

57
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:23,084
My parents,
Mr. and Mrs. Bauford.

58
00:04:23,162 --> 00:04:25,027
Oh, thank goodness, you both
have the same last name.

59
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:26,030
Good.

60
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:27,225
Pleasure to meet you, Charlotte,

61
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:28,267
or do you say Charley?

62
00:04:28,334 --> 00:04:29,528
Um, right now,
I'd say I'm a mess,

63
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:30,534
so if you don't mind...

64
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:32,093
I'll take you to the bathroom.

65
00:04:32,171 --> 00:04:33,138
Okay.

66
00:04:33,206 --> 00:04:34,104
Back in a sec.

67
00:04:35,808 --> 00:04:38,106
Although, according to one
Ethiopian village log drummer,

68
00:04:38,177 --> 00:04:40,941
it translates as "I've just
eaten a sodden grape pie."

69
00:04:41,047 --> 00:04:42,139
Ha-ha.

70
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:44,781
Oh...

71
00:04:44,851 --> 00:04:46,580
Sorry.

72
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,849
Look at you.

73
00:04:52,925 --> 00:04:54,256
Oh, sweetie, you look beautiful.

74
00:04:54,327 --> 00:04:55,259
Look at you.

75
00:04:55,328 --> 00:04:56,886
Look at you...
you're in a dress.

76
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:58,362
Oh, please, a dress.

77
00:04:58,431 --> 00:05:00,558
I look like lvana Trump
after a couple of rounds, baby.

78
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:01,565
Whew.

79
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:02,566
Come here.

80
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:03,602
What?

81
00:05:05,271 --> 00:05:06,829
First, you've got
to be kidding me.

82
00:05:06,906 --> 00:05:08,100
You know this is pointless.

83
00:05:08,174 --> 00:05:09,835
Oh, I hate this.

84
00:05:11,177 --> 00:05:13,042
So what do you think of him?

85
00:05:13,112 --> 00:05:14,704
I think he's
an absolute sweetheart.

86
00:05:14,781 --> 00:05:16,544
He's gorgeous, really, he is.

87
00:05:16,616 --> 00:05:20,279
He is, and he's sweet
and he's funny and wild.

88
00:05:20,353 --> 00:05:21,342
He's very English.

89
00:05:21,421 --> 00:05:22,581
You married a very English
Englishman.

90
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:24,884
You're blushing!

91
00:05:26,793 --> 00:05:27,851
How's home?

92
00:05:27,927 --> 00:05:29,053
Home's good.
It misses you.

93
00:05:29,128 --> 00:05:30,186
Work?

94
00:05:30,263 --> 00:05:31,696
Oh, you know, very exciting.

95
00:05:31,764 --> 00:05:33,925
They gave me a story
about a ten-car pile-up

96
00:05:34,067 --> 00:05:34,931
on 54th Street.

97
00:05:35,068 --> 00:05:36,035
You know, whatever.

98
00:05:36,102 --> 00:05:37,694
Looking up?

99
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:39,795
Oh, top of the news pile,
you know?

100
00:05:39,872 --> 00:05:41,669
You will be.

101
00:05:41,741 --> 00:05:43,641
Someday.

102
00:05:43,743 --> 00:05:44,675
But on that note,

103
00:05:44,744 --> 00:05:45,938
I think it's time
I left the stage

104
00:05:46,045 --> 00:05:47,740
and brought on someone
very special indeed.

105
00:05:47,814 --> 00:05:49,509
Thank you very much.

106
00:05:52,218 --> 00:05:53,344
Hi, um...

107
00:05:53,419 --> 00:05:56,946
I'm sorry to interrupt,
but Mr. Bauford's son, Henry,

108
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:58,752
would like to make
an announcement.

109
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:04,591
Thank you.

110
00:06:04,664 --> 00:06:05,892
Now, ladies and gentlemen,

111
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:09,399
as you know, one of the reasons
we're here tonight

112
00:06:09,469 --> 00:06:12,563
is to show our appreciation
to Lawrence Bauford

113
00:06:12,638 --> 00:06:15,163
for all the great work
he's done

114
00:06:15,241 --> 00:06:17,675
as Chairman of Aid Relief
lnternational.

115
00:06:27,687 --> 00:06:28,949
Sir... Sir!

116
00:06:36,262 --> 00:06:37,320
Sarah!

117
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:39,160
Oh, darling.

118
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:40,699
-She's cut.
-Oh God.

119
00:06:40,767 --> 00:06:41,927
Are you all right?

120
00:06:48,441 --> 00:06:50,272
You ask me,
it's a bloody rip-off.

121
00:06:50,343 --> 00:06:52,072
1,000 quid
for an over-cooked meal

122
00:06:52,145 --> 00:06:53,407
and a dry hump
on the dance floor,

123
00:06:53,479 --> 00:06:55,470
but still, we're all
getting drunk for a good cause.

124
00:06:55,548 --> 00:06:57,209
Right?

125
00:06:57,283 --> 00:06:58,648
Cheers.

126
00:07:01,287 --> 00:07:02,311
Get him out of here.

127
00:07:02,388 --> 00:07:03,377
It's a bit difficult...

128
00:07:03,456 --> 00:07:04,388
Well, bloody do something.

129
00:07:04,457 --> 00:07:07,654
20 quid a head right there.

130
00:07:07,727 --> 00:07:09,024
Divvy a room rental,
maybe another 20.

131
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:10,323
30 on catering.

132
00:07:10,396 --> 00:07:12,091
It's got to be 50 quid
on overhead.

133
00:07:12,165 --> 00:07:13,257
There you go, Jojo.

134
00:07:13,332 --> 00:07:14,629
That's your cut.

135
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:15,826
Oh, I'm sorry.

136
00:07:15,902 --> 00:07:18,029
You haven't met.

137
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:20,334
This is Jojo.

138
00:07:27,914 --> 00:07:30,041
Actually, he's curious
about your dinner

139
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:32,243
because when I met him,
he was so hungry

140
00:07:32,318 --> 00:07:34,377
he was trying
to eat his own tongue.

141
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:36,285
Funny enough, they don't do
Caesar salad with that.

142
00:07:36,355 --> 00:07:38,289
No, listen,

143
00:07:38,357 --> 00:07:40,052
I'll be honest, and I do want
to be honest.

144
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:41,093
He was a pile of bones

145
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,149
in a pool of shit,

146
00:07:42,228 --> 00:07:44,423
and I don't mean
civilized shit either.

147
00:07:44,497 --> 00:07:45,896
This was the yellow stuff,

148
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:47,557
Iiquid fucking evil.

149
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:49,533
Anyhow, I've got 2000 kids
in my camp in Africa

150
00:07:49,602 --> 00:07:50,660
with the same problem,

151
00:07:50,736 --> 00:07:52,931
and some fucking asshole here
has pulled our funding.

152
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:55,303
So I guess I'm just going
to have to feed them flies.

153
00:07:55,374 --> 00:07:57,672
Now, Jojo here,
he wanted to know why.

154
00:07:57,743 --> 00:07:58,937
So I showed him this.

155
00:07:59,078 --> 00:08:01,046
"Due to the repressive
political climate,

156
00:08:01,113 --> 00:08:03,206
"we can no longer sustain
a relief presence

157
00:08:03,282 --> 00:08:05,182
in Communist-supported
Ethiopia."

158
00:08:05,251 --> 00:08:06,775
Is that a fair description,
Larry?

159
00:08:06,853 --> 00:08:08,480
Or did you want
a more positive spin?

160
00:08:08,554 --> 00:08:10,078
All right, Dr. Callahan.

161
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:11,555
You've said your piece.

162
00:08:11,624 --> 00:08:12,784
Now you can leave.

163
00:08:12,859 --> 00:08:14,190
Why don't you come up here?
Come on.

164
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:16,319
The kid just wants to hear
in words he can understand.

165
00:08:16,395 --> 00:08:18,488
2,000 lives,
what does that buy you?

166
00:08:18,564 --> 00:08:19,496
A new car?

167
00:08:19,565 --> 00:08:22,193
A new pair of tits for the wife?

168
00:08:22,268 --> 00:08:23,860
Well, come on, don't be shy.

169
00:08:23,936 --> 00:08:25,426
I've got a camp

170
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:28,906
with 30,000 people,
dying at 40 a day.

171
00:08:28,975 --> 00:08:30,909
I've got measles, typhoid,
cholera...

172
00:08:30,977 --> 00:08:32,137
every miserable fucking disease

173
00:08:32,211 --> 00:08:33,143
known to man.

174
00:08:33,212 --> 00:08:34,543
Six weeks from now,
they'll all be dead.

175
00:08:36,749 --> 00:08:37,681
Come on.

176
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,342
Talk to me.

177
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:19,724
Oh, I get it.

178
00:09:19,792 --> 00:09:22,590
It's the monkey joke, right?

179
00:09:22,662 --> 00:09:25,096
You want him to go...

180
00:09:25,164 --> 00:09:26,688
for you, yeah?

181
00:09:26,766 --> 00:09:28,893
Oh, he'll do that.

182
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:32,899
He'll do that for you.

183
00:09:32,972 --> 00:09:34,371
Jojo...

184
00:09:54,327 --> 00:09:56,818
300 calories in one banana--

185
00:09:56,896 --> 00:09:57,988
more than he gets in a day.

186
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,567
He'll do whatever you want.

187
00:10:05,004 --> 00:10:06,437
Jojo!

188
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:59,450
All right, you want to get down
out of the van now, please?

189
00:11:06,699 --> 00:11:07,723
Sir?

190
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,631
Excuse me, sir.

191
00:11:09,702 --> 00:11:11,693
Can you get down
from the vehicle now, please?

192
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,735
Come on. In you go.

193
00:11:56,816 --> 00:11:58,511
Dr. Callahan, I presume?

194
00:11:58,584 --> 00:12:01,018
I was there tonight.

195
00:12:01,087 --> 00:12:03,453
I was compelled.

196
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:12,490
EGRlS.

197
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:15,625
Sounds pretentious enough
to be a charity.

198
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:18,363
No, wait a minute, I remember.

199
00:12:18,437 --> 00:12:19,904
I was in India when

200
00:12:19,972 --> 00:12:21,906
you lot were working the
borders with Afghanistan.

201
00:12:21,974 --> 00:12:23,942
Rumors were, you got in.

202
00:12:24,009 --> 00:12:26,477
There's a lot of people
still dying over there.

203
00:12:26,545 --> 00:12:28,638
They always do, Doctor.

204
00:12:28,714 --> 00:12:30,807
Yeah, well, I'm no warrior.

205
00:12:30,883 --> 00:12:32,407
I'm in the relief business.

206
00:12:32,485 --> 00:12:34,248
So I gathered.

207
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,185
So, here we are--

208
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:39,884
you with your relief work,
me with my relief work.

209
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:43,656
And isn't it a strange
coincidence,

210
00:12:43,729 --> 00:12:45,253
because I need
to get into Ethiopia,

211
00:12:45,331 --> 00:12:46,263
and you're already there.

212
00:12:46,332 --> 00:12:47,924
No thanks.

213
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,228
I'd fund your work

214
00:12:49,301 --> 00:12:51,064
of course.

215
00:12:51,137 --> 00:12:52,263
No.

216
00:12:52,338 --> 00:12:56,707
"I've got a camp with 30,000
people, dying at 40 a day.

217
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:59,574
In six weeks time,
they'll all be dead."

218
00:13:01,413 --> 00:13:03,074
Slight exaggeration perhaps,

219
00:13:03,149 --> 00:13:04,707
but very effective.

220
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:06,513
Since when did the ClA
give a shit

221
00:13:06,585 --> 00:13:08,849
about the starving in Africa?

222
00:13:08,921 --> 00:13:11,913
I presume you are ClA,
Mr. Steiger.

223
00:13:12,057 --> 00:13:13,820
Idle curiosity...

224
00:13:13,893 --> 00:13:16,521
Your performance tonight,

225
00:13:16,595 --> 00:13:18,825
was it a cry for help,

226
00:13:18,898 --> 00:13:20,024
or a cry for attention?

227
00:13:20,099 --> 00:13:21,862
I'd call it a press conference.

228
00:13:21,934 --> 00:13:25,665
No, a declaration
of independence.

229
00:13:25,738 --> 00:13:28,639
Freedom is an
expensive commodity.

230
00:13:28,707 --> 00:13:30,675
You should see what
I paid for your bail.

231
00:13:30,743 --> 00:13:33,405
No deal.

232
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:35,106
Passion is cheap, Doctor.

233
00:13:35,181 --> 00:13:37,081
If you're looking
for a dancing bear,

234
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:39,117
try the fucking circus.

235
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:57,628
Hmm. Cigarettes at dawn.

236
00:13:57,703 --> 00:14:00,866
Either you're deliriously happy,
or you haven't slept.

237
00:14:02,308 --> 00:14:04,173
Do you need me
to call you a cab?

238
00:14:04,243 --> 00:14:05,835
No, I already called one.

239
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:09,037
How's your hand?

240
00:14:09,114 --> 00:14:10,103
Oh, it's fine.

241
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:13,909
So, Henry, is he, uh...?

242
00:14:13,986 --> 00:14:16,250
Oh, he's-he's still sleeping.

243
00:14:16,322 --> 00:14:17,289
Oh.

244
00:14:18,891 --> 00:14:21,519
So...

245
00:14:21,594 --> 00:14:23,357
I'm going to miss you.

246
00:14:23,429 --> 00:14:25,192
Yeah, me, too.

247
00:14:25,264 --> 00:14:26,196
But, you know, listen,

248
00:14:26,265 --> 00:14:27,562
if it gets too English
over here,

249
00:14:27,633 --> 00:14:29,100
you give me a call,
and I'll send you

250
00:14:29,168 --> 00:14:31,534
a nice American care package
full of macaroni and cheese

251
00:14:31,604 --> 00:14:34,334
and apple pie,
and a pair of sneakers.

252
00:14:34,406 --> 00:14:37,603
That'll go over well here in
fashionable London, I'm sure.

253
00:14:39,411 --> 00:14:40,435
Hello?

254
00:14:40,512 --> 00:14:43,948
-Cab for Ms. Jordan.
-Okay, thank you.

255
00:14:44,016 --> 00:14:45,381
Well, it's here.

256
00:14:45,451 --> 00:14:46,543
T ell Mr. Sleepy Pants,

257
00:14:46,619 --> 00:14:49,053
that I said good-bye,
pip-pip, cheerio,

258
00:14:49,121 --> 00:14:50,850
or whatever the hell
they do here.

259
00:14:50,923 --> 00:14:51,855
I love you.

260
00:14:51,924 --> 00:14:53,186
I love you, too.

261
00:14:53,259 --> 00:14:54,419
Bye, sis.

262
00:14:54,493 --> 00:14:56,427
-Take care.
-You, too.

263
00:14:56,495 --> 00:14:58,292
...the boy escaped
while being transferred

264
00:14:58,364 --> 00:15:01,891
to the immigration
facility at Heathrow Airport.

265
00:15:02,034 --> 00:15:03,695
His body was found
early this morning

266
00:15:03,769 --> 00:15:05,737
here under Junction Five.

267
00:15:05,804 --> 00:15:08,068
Initial reports suggest
he died of hypothermia.

268
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:11,041
A spokesman
for the lmmigration Department

269
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:13,908
blamed the security lapse
on staff shortages.

270
00:15:14,013 --> 00:15:16,607
We are told that the boy
was arrested the previous night

271
00:15:16,682 --> 00:15:19,708
in a disturbance at a charity
ball in a London hotel.

272
00:15:19,785 --> 00:15:22,618
A man identified
as Nicholas Callahan,

273
00:15:22,688 --> 00:15:24,519
a relief worker in Ethiopia,

274
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:27,024
interrupted the event
with an emotional plea

275
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:28,650
for more help in Africa.

276
00:15:28,727 --> 00:15:31,924
At Junction Five,
Aidan Pickering, LNS.

277
00:15:32,064 --> 00:15:33,725
When Dubuque started,

278
00:15:33,799 --> 00:15:35,733
you could see how much
she owed to Van Gogh.

279
00:15:35,801 --> 00:15:38,099
She didn't hide it;
it's in all her landscapes,

280
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:41,697
But if you look here, what she's
doing in this abstract

281
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:44,834
is something much more
calculated, more developed.

282
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:48,607
The way she takes the-the theme
of attraction and repulsion,

283
00:15:48,681 --> 00:15:51,172
dark against light.

284
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:55,584
Over here, another piece,
which I think

285
00:15:55,654 --> 00:15:57,053
has even more emotional depth.

286
00:15:57,122 --> 00:15:58,089
It's beautiful, isn't it?

287
00:15:59,258 --> 00:16:01,852
Now, we do have...
other examples of her work,

288
00:16:01,927 --> 00:16:03,690
which I think you should see.

289
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:06,731
Sweetheart, are you sure you
know what you're doing?

290
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:08,061
Yes, I do.

291
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:10,158
And before you say anything,
I've spoken

292
00:16:10,235 --> 00:16:12,703
to all the relevant relief
organizations and embassies,

293
00:16:12,771 --> 00:16:13,863
and with 40,000 pounds...

294
00:16:13,939 --> 00:16:14,871
40,000 pounds?

295
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:16,100
What are you talking about?

296
00:16:16,175 --> 00:16:17,540
Where are you going
to find 40,000...?

297
00:16:17,609 --> 00:16:19,634
...and supplies from surplus
regions in Southern Sudan.

298
00:16:19,712 --> 00:16:22,510
And from there,
I transport them to Tigre.

299
00:16:22,581 --> 00:16:23,741
I've cleared out my savings,

300
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:25,408
I'm still short about 8,000.

301
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:27,111
But, Sarah, this isn't
how it's done.

302
00:16:27,186 --> 00:16:28,118
You don't go...

303
00:16:28,187 --> 00:16:29,745
Henry, Henry.
I've made up my mind.

304
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:32,450
Well, then send the money,
do charitable work, whatever,

305
00:16:32,524 --> 00:16:33,491
but don't go roaring off

306
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:34,924
to some godforsaken hole
in Africa

307
00:16:35,027 --> 00:16:36,255
just to salve your conscience.

308
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:37,260
It's just too...

309
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:38,591
Too what?

310
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:40,757
Well, it's not the most
grown-up way to deal with

311
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:41,595
this situation.

312
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:42,725
Well, maybe I don't want
to grow up.

313
00:16:49,908 --> 00:16:52,172
Fine...

314
00:16:52,244 --> 00:16:54,610
Fine.

315
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:55,647
If that's what you want,

316
00:16:55,714 --> 00:16:57,409
-lt is.
-then fine.

317
00:16:57,483 --> 00:16:59,508
Then...

318
00:16:59,585 --> 00:17:00,882
I'll help you find the money.

319
00:17:02,388 --> 00:17:04,049
Thank you.

320
00:17:04,123 --> 00:17:05,613
I'll talk to Dad.

321
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:07,750
He knows everybody.

322
00:17:07,826 --> 00:17:10,021
Mind you, Ethiopia is a bit...

323
00:17:10,095 --> 00:17:11,426
It'll be fine.

324
00:17:11,497 --> 00:17:14,989
It'll be fine.
We'll find the money.

325
00:17:16,101 --> 00:17:17,898
Come with me.

326
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:19,528
Honey, even if I could...

327
00:17:19,605 --> 00:17:20,629
You can't?

328
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:21,832
No, it's not that.

329
00:17:21,907 --> 00:17:23,875
You know me, I'm not made
for that kind of thing.

330
00:17:23,942 --> 00:17:26,672
I'm a city boy. I need
four walls and a bed.

331
00:17:26,745 --> 00:17:28,406
Besides, I've got meetings
up to here

332
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,504
for the next month.

333
00:17:35,687 --> 00:17:37,712
You should go.

334
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:40,315
You've got the right attitude.

335
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:43,486
Listen, I know this sounds
like Little Miss Bleeding Heart

336
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:46,929
and all that...
I just, I don't care.

337
00:17:46,999 --> 00:17:49,797
I know I'm being crazy
and driving you crazy,

338
00:17:49,868 --> 00:17:52,166
and of course I understand
you can't come, but...

339
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:53,829
you meet me off the plane?

340
00:17:55,507 --> 00:17:56,804
You meet me off the plane?

341
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:59,844
Of course I'll meet
you off the plane.

342
00:19:00,038 --> 00:19:02,632
Three years and no rain,
not a drop.

343
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:04,073
That, and war.

344
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:09,012
People leave their homes,
they walk for many days.

345
00:19:09,081 --> 00:19:10,571
We only have ten camps
on the south side.

346
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:13,812
Too many people,
not enough camps.

347
00:19:22,394 --> 00:19:23,759
Measles, you know measles?

348
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:24,887
Yes, of course.

349
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:28,431
We lose more people
to measles and diarrhea.

350
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,092
Many die, no vaccine.

351
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:32,899
-We brought some vaccines...
-Also cholera, everywhere.

352
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:35,235
We dig very deep now
for good water.

353
00:19:35,307 --> 00:19:39,641
Starvation everywhere,
death is everywhere.

354
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:47,316
You speak English very well.

355
00:19:47,386 --> 00:19:49,115
Missionaries teach me.

356
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:51,588
Yeah?

357
00:19:51,657 --> 00:19:52,817
So are you married?

358
00:19:52,891 --> 00:19:54,791
-Do you have a husband?
-Man? Bullshit.

359
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:55,918
I need no man.

360
00:19:56,061 --> 00:19:58,188
They beg to marry me,
many times,

361
00:19:58,263 --> 00:19:59,821
but I drive truck.

362
00:19:59,898 --> 00:20:01,229
Lazy man, good-for-nothing.

363
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:04,326
I'm too old now anyway.

364
00:20:04,403 --> 00:20:06,564
No man in my village
want woman over 18.

365
00:20:06,638 --> 00:20:08,731
In my tribe, it's 30.

366
00:20:14,112 --> 00:20:15,204
Stop.

367
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,874
Stop the truck. Stop. Stop!

368
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:47,575
Abraha!

369
00:20:47,646 --> 00:20:49,876
Abraha!

370
00:20:52,684 --> 00:20:55,847
Abraha...

371
00:21:00,659 --> 00:21:03,184
Is this your son?

372
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:05,696
This your son?

373
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:08,426
Abraha...

374
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:09,592
Abraha?

375
00:21:09,668 --> 00:21:12,535
Ab-Ab...

376
00:21:14,306 --> 00:21:15,432
No baby.

377
00:21:15,507 --> 00:21:18,067
We go.
Too dangerous to stop.

378
00:21:19,845 --> 00:21:21,039
We go now.

379
00:21:30,589 --> 00:21:33,080
Is a waste.

380
00:21:33,158 --> 00:21:37,686
Child and mother, both a waste.

381
00:21:37,763 --> 00:21:39,196
Stupid baby woman.

382
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:19,650
Tula, shut up.

383
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:27,856
I'll give you four bags.

384
00:24:27,933 --> 00:24:30,333
Four bags not enough.

385
00:24:30,402 --> 00:24:32,370
I take one truck.

386
00:24:32,437 --> 00:24:34,928
You want to tell them that
you're taking half their food?

387
00:24:35,073 --> 00:24:36,472
How many are you?
50? A hundred?

388
00:24:36,541 --> 00:24:37,565
My men fight...

389
00:24:37,642 --> 00:24:39,200
I know, I know--
for the people.

390
00:24:39,277 --> 00:24:40,175
Mm.

391
00:24:56,061 --> 00:24:57,995
It's good.

392
00:25:15,881 --> 00:25:17,371
No. No, no, no, no.

393
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:21,447
Eight bags.

394
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,454
Four each truck.

395
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:25,149
This is fair.

396
00:25:25,223 --> 00:25:26,781
Hmm, Mr. Elliott?

397
00:25:26,858 --> 00:25:28,917
Fair, yes?

398
00:25:37,302 --> 00:25:39,327
Welcome to famine relief.

399
00:26:07,465 --> 00:26:08,830
Okay, kill it!

400
00:26:22,147 --> 00:26:23,910
Hold his legs, okay?

401
00:26:49,975 --> 00:26:51,237
Excuse me.

402
00:26:51,309 --> 00:26:52,571
Excuse me.

403
00:26:52,644 --> 00:26:54,578
This child,
his mother's in the truck.

404
00:26:54,646 --> 00:26:55,806
She's wounded.

405
00:27:14,599 --> 00:27:15,759
-Too late.
-What?

406
00:27:15,834 --> 00:27:18,200
Too late, as in no point.

407
00:27:18,269 --> 00:27:19,201
Why?

408
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:20,396
Why?

409
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:23,339
Well, quite apart from
any illnesses they may have,

410
00:27:23,408 --> 00:27:24,898
they're too weak to survive.

411
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:27,308
You, just...

412
00:27:27,379 --> 00:27:28,505
You just decide that?

413
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:30,138
It's called triage.
I'm a doctor.

414
00:27:30,215 --> 00:27:31,477
-I've got 30,000...
-I know.

415
00:27:31,549 --> 00:27:33,039
I heard that already in London.

416
00:27:34,653 --> 00:27:35,779
You did?

417
00:27:35,854 --> 00:27:37,481
Yes. I still think
you should help them.

418
00:27:37,555 --> 00:27:38,613
Oh, you do, do you?

419
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:39,657
Yes, I do.

420
00:27:39,724 --> 00:27:41,157
I see. You pay
for these trucks,

421
00:27:41,226 --> 00:27:43,592
so I have to indulge
some fucking white girl's idea

422
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:44,594
of heroism, right?

423
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:46,221
Well, why stop there?
Do you want a picture?

424
00:27:46,297 --> 00:27:47,321
I can get you a picture

425
00:27:47,399 --> 00:27:49,731
of "poor little rich girl
holds dying black baby."

426
00:27:49,801 --> 00:27:51,769
You do your hair right,
you'll look great.

427
00:27:51,836 --> 00:27:53,531
I saw the child from the truck.

428
00:27:53,605 --> 00:27:55,903
I picked him up,
his mother was wounded.

429
00:27:55,974 --> 00:27:57,908
I brought her, too.

430
00:27:57,976 --> 00:27:59,409
Can you please look at them?

431
00:28:06,918 --> 00:28:08,078
Seems fair.

432
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:16,220
Kat.

433
00:28:19,464 --> 00:28:20,396
Hi.

434
00:28:20,465 --> 00:28:22,365
Hi.
I'm Kat.

435
00:28:25,804 --> 00:28:28,170
Okay, so...
I'm the chief administrator

436
00:28:28,239 --> 00:28:32,733
and logistician, if that
doesn't sound too pompous,

437
00:28:32,811 --> 00:28:34,108
and you've met Nick,

438
00:28:34,179 --> 00:28:37,080
who's our team leader
and full-time doctor.

439
00:28:37,148 --> 00:28:39,082
He's got a lot on his hands
right now.

440
00:28:46,324 --> 00:28:49,851
So this is
the food-distribution center.

441
00:28:49,928 --> 00:28:51,452
Low-tech but effective,

442
00:28:51,529 --> 00:28:53,895
like the rest of us.

443
00:28:53,965 --> 00:28:56,433
The food supplies I brought,
how long will they last?

444
00:28:56,501 --> 00:28:59,368
Oh, three or four days, maybe.

445
00:28:59,437 --> 00:29:00,631
That's it?

446
00:29:00,705 --> 00:29:03,833
I'm afraid so, yeah.

447
00:29:03,908 --> 00:29:05,375
What are you going to do
when the food runs out?

448
00:29:05,443 --> 00:29:07,502
Well, we usually find a way.

449
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:10,047
Same old story really,
you know--

450
00:29:10,115 --> 00:29:12,709
money, or the lack of it,

451
00:29:12,784 --> 00:29:15,150
but with help, we get by.

452
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:52,419
Um, I don't think
you want to go...

453
00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:54,549
Is it all right?

454
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:57,117
Sure. Yeah.

455
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:04,628
Well, if it isn't Mrs. Bauford.

456
00:30:04,702 --> 00:30:09,230
Sorry about the mess.

457
00:30:10,441 --> 00:30:12,102
You won't see this
in medical school.

458
00:30:16,981 --> 00:30:18,448
Cut.

459
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:24,849
If you're going to throw up,

460
00:30:24,923 --> 00:30:25,912
close your eyes.

461
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:26,922
Think of ponies

462
00:30:26,991 --> 00:30:29,255
and ice cream.

463
00:30:29,327 --> 00:30:30,624
Is that... perfume?

464
00:30:33,331 --> 00:30:36,926
You're wearing perfume in the
middle of the fucking desert.

465
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:38,559
Ha-ha.

466
00:30:41,606 --> 00:30:43,096
The boy, has he been looked at?

467
00:30:43,174 --> 00:30:44,801
Yes, ma'am. Checking him now.

468
00:30:44,876 --> 00:30:46,241
One shed over.

469
00:30:46,311 --> 00:30:47,573
As you instructed.

470
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:55,380
-What does it mean?
-Sew it up.

471
00:30:55,453 --> 00:30:56,977
Monica, get her a Fanta.

472
00:31:09,834 --> 00:31:11,768
It's weird isn't it?

473
00:31:11,836 --> 00:31:13,064
All those plans you have,

474
00:31:13,137 --> 00:31:14,365
places to go, people to meet.

475
00:31:14,439 --> 00:31:16,407
All that matters
in her whole world is that.

476
00:31:16,474 --> 00:31:19,671
Just one suck of soda,
that's all she lives for.

477
00:31:19,744 --> 00:31:21,803
She's in pain--
can't you give her something?

478
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:22,812
Oh, yeah, sure.

479
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:24,280
Monica, call down
to the pharmacy

480
00:31:24,349 --> 00:31:25,646
for more morphine, could you?

481
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:27,651
Where do you think you are,
Saint Elsewhere?

482
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:28,947
She's in pain.

483
00:31:29,053 --> 00:31:29,951
She's beyond pain.

484
00:31:30,054 --> 00:31:30,918
Have you asked her that?

485
00:31:32,991 --> 00:31:35,391
Hamadi.

486
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:36,757
Ask her if it hurts.

487
00:31:57,682 --> 00:31:59,547
She, uh...

488
00:31:59,617 --> 00:32:03,383
says she feels
the pain of hunger, but

489
00:32:03,454 --> 00:32:05,046
she knows that death
more hungry than pain,

490
00:32:05,123 --> 00:32:07,057
so, she gives thanks.

491
00:32:07,125 --> 00:32:09,389
She gives thanks to you.

492
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:11,860
She calls you by a new name.

493
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:14,091
Matanay.

494
00:32:14,165 --> 00:32:16,258
"He who steals from Death."

495
00:32:54,205 --> 00:32:56,503
He's got a fever,
and he's in shock.

496
00:32:58,543 --> 00:33:00,704
Increase the fluids.
Antibiotics.

497
00:33:06,951 --> 00:33:09,886
You really think he's going
to sit up and take a drink?

498
00:33:09,954 --> 00:33:10,886
I was just...

499
00:33:10,955 --> 00:33:11,887
He's dying.

500
00:33:11,956 --> 00:33:13,048
You'd better move his lips,

501
00:33:13,124 --> 00:33:14,148
or he won't take a cup.

502
00:33:14,225 --> 00:33:15,283
I was just trying to help.

503
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,292
T o help, you have

504
00:33:16,361 --> 00:33:17,385
to know what you're doing.

505
00:33:17,462 --> 00:33:18,827
Look, I know
you think I'm stupid,

506
00:33:18,896 --> 00:33:20,022
and you want me to go home.

507
00:33:20,098 --> 00:33:21,622
You don't have
to waste any more time

508
00:33:21,699 --> 00:33:23,394
trying to make that clear to me.

509
00:33:30,174 --> 00:33:31,334
Get some H.E.M.

510
00:33:31,409 --> 00:33:32,603
High Energy Milk.

511
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:34,611
Monica will give it to you.

512
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:36,943
You tease around his mouth
with your finger.

513
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:39,279
You let him suck it out,
small amounts only.

514
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:40,908
If he revives, call the nurse.

515
00:33:40,985 --> 00:33:43,112
If he doesn't...

516
00:33:43,187 --> 00:33:46,350
at least he'll have someone
with him when he dies.

517
00:34:37,975 --> 00:34:38,907
How many?

518
00:34:38,976 --> 00:34:41,843
Kat?

519
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:43,904
1  from last night.

520
00:34:43,981 --> 00:34:46,245
12.

521
00:34:46,317 --> 00:34:47,579
The ten-year-old.

522
00:34:47,652 --> 00:34:49,552
That makes 39.

523
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:50,848
So there's more than yesterday.

524
00:34:50,922 --> 00:34:51,854
I know.

525
00:34:51,923 --> 00:34:53,151
Right, and you'd better hire

526
00:34:53,224 --> 00:34:55,749
extra men from the camp
and get them digging more holes.

527
00:34:55,827 --> 00:34:57,795
Put them on night shift
so nobody sees them.

528
00:34:57,862 --> 00:34:59,762
Can't have people dying
of depression, eh?

529
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:06,134
How's the water coming, Joss?

530
00:35:07,605 --> 00:35:08,537
Nothing so far.

531
00:35:08,606 --> 00:35:10,233
Drive shaft
is close to buggering,

532
00:35:10,308 --> 00:35:12,742
and we're down to two liters
per person per day.

533
00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:14,573
What about the tankers?

534
00:35:14,645 --> 00:35:16,442
Yeah, sure. That's piss
in a bucket, mate.

535
00:35:16,514 --> 00:35:18,209
Basically, if we don't
get the new well

536
00:35:18,282 --> 00:35:19,909
up and running, we're knackered.

537
00:35:20,017 --> 00:35:21,541
Okay, so what
do you need exactly?

538
00:35:21,619 --> 00:35:22,551
I just told you.

539
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:24,212
A new drive shaft.

540
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:26,984
Okay, I'm going to see
what I can do.

541
00:35:34,832 --> 00:35:36,800
Well, the good news,
boys and girls,

542
00:35:36,868 --> 00:35:39,769
is that the government's
finally coming tomorrow.

543
00:35:39,837 --> 00:35:41,134
I got confirmation today

544
00:35:41,205 --> 00:35:43,230
that Mr. Ningpopo himself
will be here.

545
00:35:43,307 --> 00:35:45,104
For about an hour.

546
00:35:45,176 --> 00:35:46,302
That long?

547
00:35:46,377 --> 00:35:47,309
Well, you never know.

548
00:35:47,378 --> 00:35:48,402
-We might get lucky.
-Right.

549
00:35:48,479 --> 00:35:49,503
Here's what we're going to do.

550
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:50,911
First thing
in the morning, we're going

551
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:51,914
to break open the new supplies,

552
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:52,950
start immunizing
all the children

553
00:35:53,017 --> 00:35:53,949
against measles,
youngest first,

554
00:35:54,018 --> 00:35:55,542
up the line, until we run out.

555
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:57,053
Okay? Kat, Monica: I want you

556
00:35:57,121 --> 00:35:58,645
to get onto that
as early as possible.

557
00:35:58,723 --> 00:35:59,712
All right.

558
00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:02,122
I'll set up the call chain
and check the syringes.

559
00:36:02,193 --> 00:36:03,820
No, I'm going to need you
with me, and you, Tula.

560
00:36:03,895 --> 00:36:05,055
-Joss.
-Yeah.

561
00:36:05,129 --> 00:36:06,460
Sanitation.

562
00:36:06,531 --> 00:36:08,328
I think you need
to take your team

563
00:36:08,399 --> 00:36:10,765
and cut a new defecation area
somewhere beyond the camp.

564
00:36:10,835 --> 00:36:11,767
Yeah, and let's just

565
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:12,768
chlorinate all the water, okay?

566
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:13,804
All of it.

567
00:36:13,871 --> 00:36:15,395
Yeah, the tankard water
is absolutely fine.

568
00:36:15,473 --> 00:36:17,407
Fuck the tanker water.
Just chlorinate the lot.

569
00:36:17,475 --> 00:36:18,999
There's too much infection
to risk leaving it, okay?

570
00:36:19,076 --> 00:36:20,168
Okay.

571
00:36:20,244 --> 00:36:22,405
Okay.

572
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:23,538
Good.

573
00:36:23,614 --> 00:36:25,514
All right, make sure
you get me your requests

574
00:36:25,583 --> 00:36:27,608
for Ningpopo
as soon as possible.

575
00:36:27,685 --> 00:36:30,176
Two hookers
and a single to Melbourne.

576
00:36:30,254 --> 00:36:31,653
Business or coach?

577
00:36:36,527 --> 00:36:37,892
Good night, Sarah.

578
00:36:37,962 --> 00:36:38,929
Good night.

579
00:36:44,835 --> 00:36:46,894
Oh, I forgot.

580
00:36:46,971 --> 00:36:49,906
The boy's mother.

581
00:36:49,974 --> 00:36:51,271
She died.

582
00:37:05,256 --> 00:37:08,054
We've got about ten days left.

583
00:37:08,125 --> 00:37:10,958
Maybe two weeks,
if we're lucky.

584
00:37:12,830 --> 00:37:14,320
What happened with USAlD?

585
00:37:14,398 --> 00:37:15,729
Nothing.

586
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,097
CARE?

587
00:37:17,168 --> 00:37:19,636
CARE, USAlD, the OXFAM, WFB...

588
00:37:19,704 --> 00:37:20,864
they don't want to know.

589
00:37:20,938 --> 00:37:21,870
Everyone I spoke to

590
00:37:21,939 --> 00:37:23,873
in Addis had an acute case

591
00:37:23,941 --> 00:37:24,873
of compassion fatigue.

592
00:37:24,942 --> 00:37:25,874
How 'bout the old man?

593
00:37:25,943 --> 00:37:27,240
The trust fund?

594
00:37:27,311 --> 00:37:30,747
My father was the politest
"fuck you" I ever got.

595
00:37:34,318 --> 00:37:35,410
What about Steiger?

596
00:37:35,486 --> 00:37:37,317
Some small favors,

597
00:37:37,388 --> 00:37:38,787
a little info on...

598
00:37:38,856 --> 00:37:39,914
Yeah, stash a shitload
of weapons...

599
00:37:40,024 --> 00:37:41,855
So what if he's fucking over
the Marxists...

600
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:43,359
I'm not getting into business
with those people.

601
00:37:43,427 --> 00:37:45,657
Listen, Elliott, if it's
all we got, I don't see why...

602
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:47,891
-There is no way...
-Why not for, Christ's sake?

603
00:37:47,965 --> 00:37:50,661
Because that's not how
we started!

604
00:37:50,735 --> 00:37:54,933
And because I wouldn't
have it any other way.

605
00:37:59,744 --> 00:38:03,236
What the hell is that?

606
00:38:03,314 --> 00:38:07,375
Schumann, I think.

607
00:38:57,501 --> 00:38:59,366
Hi.

608
00:39:10,281 --> 00:39:12,875
"l dream of childhood.

609
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:16,544
"l dream of love.

610
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:19,350
"Of a garden where
a boy plays,

611
00:39:19,423 --> 00:39:21,618
forever young."

612
00:39:21,692 --> 00:39:24,855
"Themes from Childhood."

613
00:39:24,929 --> 00:39:29,298
Part of a series
from Schumann's "Lederhosen."

614
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:31,927
Lederhosen are trousers.

615
00:39:33,404 --> 00:39:34,462
Ah.

616
00:39:34,538 --> 00:39:38,201
The German for song is lieder.

617
00:39:38,275 --> 00:39:39,867
Lieder.

618
00:39:39,944 --> 00:39:42,276
Yes, correct.

619
00:39:53,023 --> 00:39:55,218
Is there something you wanted?

620
00:39:57,862 --> 00:39:59,693
The baby.

621
00:39:59,764 --> 00:40:01,925
You tried the H.E.M.?

622
00:40:02,066 --> 00:40:03,465
Yes.

623
00:40:03,534 --> 00:40:05,195
And?

624
00:40:05,269 --> 00:40:08,204
And no change.

625
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:11,602
Sometimes it takes a while.

626
00:41:49,173 --> 00:41:51,505
Hey, woman, come, come.

627
00:42:31,715 --> 00:42:33,182
Yes.

628
00:42:34,985 --> 00:42:37,317
One life.

629
00:42:41,825 --> 00:42:43,190
Ningpopo's here.

630
00:42:54,638 --> 00:42:56,970
Look right now
we're at 800 calories a day.

631
00:42:57,041 --> 00:42:59,373
In a few days
it will be down to 500.

632
00:42:59,443 --> 00:43:01,377
The bottom line is,

633
00:43:01,445 --> 00:43:03,606
we're not going to make
next week's distribution.

634
00:43:03,681 --> 00:43:04,909
Not a chance.

635
00:43:05,015 --> 00:43:06,778
And that raises
the issue of security.

636
00:43:06,850 --> 00:43:08,647
If I can't get these people
more food,

637
00:43:08,719 --> 00:43:10,687
I can't guarantee
the safety of my staff.

638
00:43:10,754 --> 00:43:11,880
Food, security.

639
00:43:11,956 --> 00:43:13,685
I believe these are listed
as separate issues.

640
00:43:13,757 --> 00:43:17,454
Yes, but I'm sure you'd
agree they're connected.

641
00:43:36,146 --> 00:43:38,410
Well, if we could get
some emergency corn,

642
00:43:38,482 --> 00:43:39,449
that'd be a start.

643
00:43:39,516 --> 00:43:42,417
I will raise it with the WFB.

644
00:43:42,486 --> 00:43:43,418
Thank you.

645
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:44,749
They owe us since
August anyway.

646
00:43:44,822 --> 00:43:45,948
-Excuse me?
-Any emergency corn

647
00:43:46,056 --> 00:43:47,216
would be greatly appreciated.

648
00:43:47,291 --> 00:43:48,383
I'm sorry, excuse me,
who owes you?

649
00:43:48,459 --> 00:43:49,721
The WFB.
Three months of corn.

650
00:43:49,793 --> 00:43:50,782
It'll be in your notes.

651
00:43:50,861 --> 00:43:52,886
There's no reference
to the WFB in my notes.

652
00:43:52,963 --> 00:43:53,827
Then your notes are wrong.

653
00:43:53,897 --> 00:43:55,330
Okay, we can move on...

654
00:43:55,399 --> 00:43:56,957
to the issue of security.

655
00:43:57,034 --> 00:43:59,366
Our soldiers have no experience
of this order, Mr. Hauser.

656
00:43:59,436 --> 00:44:01,904
Please, we have another meeting
at Kromer Camp at 4:00 p.m.

657
00:44:01,972 --> 00:44:03,735
If we can deal with
these matters separately

658
00:44:03,807 --> 00:44:04,796
and in the proper order.

659
00:44:04,875 --> 00:44:07,343
It is no good to jump
from food to security.

660
00:44:07,411 --> 00:44:08,343
This is not coherent.

661
00:44:08,412 --> 00:44:09,504
Not coherent?

662
00:44:09,580 --> 00:44:11,241
Listen, they don't get
enough food, they get hungry.

663
00:44:11,315 --> 00:44:12,577
If they get hungry,
they get desperate,

664
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:13,582
they wreck the camp.

665
00:44:13,651 --> 00:44:14,743
That is a security issue.

666
00:44:14,818 --> 00:44:15,910
Please do not raise your voice.

667
00:44:15,986 --> 00:44:18,454
For Christ's sake, they're
all fucking dying out there.

668
00:44:18,522 --> 00:44:20,183
Will you please
stop talking bollocks

669
00:44:20,257 --> 00:44:22,122
and start getting some
food delivered now.

670
00:44:22,192 --> 00:44:24,251
No excuses,
no money changing hands,

671
00:44:24,328 --> 00:44:25,488
just do it.

672
00:44:25,562 --> 00:44:27,530
I find this innuendo most
disturbing, Dr. Callahan.

673
00:44:27,598 --> 00:44:29,623
I can assure you, not
a single dollar changes hands

674
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:31,258
without authorization.

675
00:44:31,335 --> 00:44:33,064
Procedures of the
utmost importance...

676
00:44:33,137 --> 00:44:34,263
Procedures, my fucking ass.

677
00:44:34,338 --> 00:44:35,930
You've got friends
in the water-trucking business

678
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:36,938
whose sole aim in life

679
00:44:37,041 --> 00:44:38,838
is to hike up the price
by restricting delivery.

680
00:44:38,909 --> 00:44:39,841
You seriously telling me

681
00:44:39,910 --> 00:44:41,434
those shitheads are
following procedure?

682
00:44:41,512 --> 00:44:42,444
I find this outrageous,

683
00:44:42,513 --> 00:44:43,445
especially coming from you.

684
00:44:43,514 --> 00:44:44,708
What do you mean
especially coming from me?

685
00:44:44,782 --> 00:44:46,443
T o take a refugee boy
from the camp

686
00:44:46,517 --> 00:44:47,609
without authorization

687
00:44:47,685 --> 00:44:50,518
to die like an animal
in a country he does not know?

688
00:44:50,587 --> 00:44:51,679
The death of a child

689
00:44:51,755 --> 00:44:53,848
is not a minor
violation, Dr. Callahan.

690
00:44:53,924 --> 00:44:55,050
I can assure you,

691
00:44:55,125 --> 00:44:58,151
you are under
serious investigation.

692
00:45:13,777 --> 00:45:14,709
What?

693
00:45:18,348 --> 00:45:19,906
He'd never have given
us anything anyway.

694
00:45:19,983 --> 00:45:22,645
Well, he certainly isn't
going to now.

695
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:23,914
What happened to his car?

696
00:45:29,660 --> 00:45:31,753
Will that fit our wellhead?

697
00:45:31,829 --> 00:45:34,821
Do kangaroos crap in the bush?

698
00:45:43,974 --> 00:45:46,841
We've got no choice.

699
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:48,810
We need Steiger.

700
00:46:00,157 --> 00:46:02,318
Dr. Callahan?

701
00:46:20,444 --> 00:46:22,537
Sorry, l...

702
00:46:22,613 --> 00:46:24,478
I just have some
traveler's checks.

703
00:46:24,548 --> 00:46:27,881
I'm leaving tomorrow, so l...
I thought I'd leave them here.

704
00:46:27,951 --> 00:46:30,613
Elliott usually deals
with all that.

705
00:46:30,687 --> 00:46:32,177
Should I give them...?

706
00:46:32,256 --> 00:46:34,019
No, I mean, it's okay,
I'll give them to him.

707
00:46:34,091 --> 00:46:35,080
Okay.

708
00:46:37,661 --> 00:46:40,892
So... is he going
to shut you down?

709
00:46:40,964 --> 00:46:42,488
Maybe.

710
00:46:42,566 --> 00:46:46,593
But we always turn up again...
somewhere.

711
00:46:46,670 --> 00:46:49,867
I really admire you
for the work you do.

712
00:46:49,940 --> 00:46:51,908
Oh, Jesus. "Admire,"
what does that mean?

713
00:46:51,975 --> 00:46:53,101
Why are you so difficult

714
00:46:53,177 --> 00:46:54,872
-to talk to?
-Why are you?

715
00:46:54,945 --> 00:46:56,936
Why do you never say my name?

716
00:46:57,047 --> 00:46:58,708
Sorry?

717
00:46:58,782 --> 00:47:00,807
You never say my name.

718
00:47:00,884 --> 00:47:02,283
Why?

719
00:47:02,352 --> 00:47:06,049
What's the first thing you
do when you get a cold?

720
00:47:06,123 --> 00:47:07,454
What?

721
00:47:07,524 --> 00:47:08,889
What is the first thing you
do when you get a cold?

722
00:47:12,663 --> 00:47:14,824
Chicken soup, aspirin, scotch.

723
00:47:14,898 --> 00:47:16,388
You ever just have the cold?

724
00:47:17,568 --> 00:47:18,500
I don't under...

725
00:47:18,569 --> 00:47:20,366
Taken nothing,
just have the cold.

726
00:47:20,437 --> 00:47:21,369
-No.
-No.

727
00:47:21,438 --> 00:47:22,905
And that's us, right?

728
00:47:23,006 --> 00:47:25,099
We drown it, kill it, numb it.

729
00:47:25,175 --> 00:47:26,767
Anything not to feel.

730
00:47:26,844 --> 00:47:28,903
You know, when I was
a doctor in London,

731
00:47:28,979 --> 00:47:30,606
no one ever said "matanay."

732
00:47:30,681 --> 00:47:32,740
They don't thank you
like they thank you here

733
00:47:32,816 --> 00:47:34,340
'cause here
they feel everything.

734
00:47:34,418 --> 00:47:35,544
Straight from God.

735
00:47:35,619 --> 00:47:38,383
There's no drugs,
there's no painkillers.

736
00:47:38,455 --> 00:47:45,327
It's the weirdest,
purest thing-- suffering.

737
00:47:45,395 --> 00:47:48,694
And when you've seen that
kind of courage in a lit...

738
00:47:53,237 --> 00:47:56,900
...in a child...

739
00:47:56,974 --> 00:47:58,942
how could you ever want
to do anything

740
00:47:59,009 --> 00:48:00,670
but just take them in your arm?

741
00:48:09,052 --> 00:48:11,043
You remember that boy in London.
Jojo?

742
00:48:11,121 --> 00:48:13,055
Yes, of course.

743
00:48:13,123 --> 00:48:15,887
He was my first save,
ten years old.

744
00:48:16,026 --> 00:48:18,324
So thin he could barely stand.

745
00:48:18,395 --> 00:48:21,694
But he still found the strength
to bury the rest of his family.

746
00:48:25,469 --> 00:48:27,369
We have no idea what courage is.

747
00:48:30,107 --> 00:48:34,510
He used to write me
these little notes.

748
00:48:34,578 --> 00:48:35,567
He helped me in the clinic.

749
00:48:35,646 --> 00:48:38,911
He was good.

750
00:48:39,049 --> 00:48:40,710
He was sweet, he was good.

751
00:48:40,784 --> 00:48:43,184
He wanted to be like me,
I liked that.

752
00:48:43,253 --> 00:48:44,720
I mean, it was silly
and childish,

753
00:48:44,788 --> 00:48:46,517
but it made me feel good
about myself.

754
00:48:46,590 --> 00:48:48,251
So I took him with me to London,

755
00:48:48,325 --> 00:48:50,623
you know, my talisman,
my courageous Africa.

756
00:48:54,031 --> 00:48:57,296
How could I be so bloody stupid?

757
00:48:57,367 --> 00:49:00,996
How could I be
so totally selfish?

758
00:49:10,514 --> 00:49:15,315
The point is...

759
00:49:15,385 --> 00:49:19,822
he was my friend.

760
00:49:19,890 --> 00:49:23,656
He had a name.

761
00:49:23,727 --> 00:49:26,423
So now I have to remember him.

762
00:49:31,568 --> 00:49:35,368
If everyone I lose has a name...

763
00:50:06,470 --> 00:50:07,562
Hey.

764
00:50:07,637 --> 00:50:08,569
Hey.

765
00:50:08,638 --> 00:50:09,900
You all set?

766
00:50:09,973 --> 00:50:11,133
Yeah.

767
00:50:11,208 --> 00:50:12,539
Said your good-byes?

768
00:50:12,609 --> 00:50:13,701
Yeah.

769
00:50:13,777 --> 00:50:15,074
Well.

770
00:50:15,145 --> 00:50:16,077
Yeah.

771
00:50:16,146 --> 00:50:17,078
Oh, um,

772
00:50:17,147 --> 00:50:20,446
this is my friend at UNHCR.

773
00:50:20,517 --> 00:50:22,849
She'll always know
how to get a hold of us.

774
00:50:22,919 --> 00:50:24,750
And that's a very good
group of people.

775
00:50:24,821 --> 00:50:26,846
If you ever want
to jump in there...

776
00:50:26,923 --> 00:50:27,947
Okay.

777
00:50:28,058 --> 00:50:29,150
Um...

778
00:50:29,226 --> 00:50:32,354
I'm so glad
that you came, Sarah.

779
00:50:32,429 --> 00:50:34,420
It meant a lot to us.

780
00:50:34,498 --> 00:50:35,430
Oh, thank you.

781
00:50:35,499 --> 00:50:37,558
No, no, I'm thanking you.

782
00:50:38,902 --> 00:50:40,699
Mikanalay.

783
00:50:40,771 --> 00:50:42,329
It means "thank you."

784
00:50:42,406 --> 00:50:43,964
And then you say, "Genzubka, "

785
00:50:44,074 --> 00:50:46,770
which means, "You're welcome."

786
00:50:46,843 --> 00:50:47,775
Genzubka.

787
00:50:47,844 --> 00:50:49,778
Yeah, pretty good.

788
00:50:49,846 --> 00:50:51,370
Well, very Buddhist.

789
00:50:51,448 --> 00:50:52,847
Do Buddhists hug?

790
00:50:52,916 --> 00:50:54,884
Sure I hug, I'm American.

791
00:50:54,951 --> 00:50:56,418
I hug everything.

792
00:51:06,430 --> 00:51:07,692
Ah, Nick's up at the well.

793
00:51:07,764 --> 00:51:09,994
-You want me to get him?
-No, no.

794
00:51:12,469 --> 00:51:13,401
Good-bye.

795
00:51:13,470 --> 00:51:14,664
Good-bye.

796
00:51:14,738 --> 00:51:16,729
You take care of yourself...

797
00:51:16,807 --> 00:51:18,502
and everybody else.

798
00:51:18,575 --> 00:51:20,406
I'll try.

799
00:51:20,477 --> 00:51:21,944
Keep in touch.

800
00:52:37,754 --> 00:52:38,948
Jim.

801
00:52:39,089 --> 00:52:40,283
Hey, come on.

802
00:52:40,357 --> 00:52:41,289
Jim!

803
00:52:41,358 --> 00:52:42,950
Baby, Mommy's got
some work to do.

804
00:52:43,026 --> 00:52:44,118
Come on, honey.
Come here.

805
00:52:44,194 --> 00:52:45,286
It's okay.
It's okay, sweetie.

806
00:52:45,362 --> 00:52:46,624
Honey, I'm going
to count to five.

807
00:52:46,696 --> 00:52:47,628
-No.
-One...

808
00:52:47,697 --> 00:52:49,187
two, three...

809
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:51,489
I'll read you two chapters.

810
00:52:51,568 --> 00:52:52,830
No. Three.

811
00:52:52,903 --> 00:52:55,133
Okay, three.

812
00:52:55,205 --> 00:52:57,332
You are nothing

813
00:52:57,407 --> 00:52:58,704
but a minx-ish minx.

814
00:52:58,775 --> 00:53:00,072
Daddy!

815
00:53:02,579 --> 00:53:03,773
Yeah, hello.

816
00:53:03,847 --> 00:53:05,838
Mommy says I can have
three chapters.

817
00:53:05,916 --> 00:53:06,848
Three chapters?

818
00:53:06,917 --> 00:53:08,407
Excellent.

819
00:53:08,485 --> 00:53:09,679
Would you mind
reading to him tonight?

820
00:53:09,753 --> 00:53:10,515
I have some work to do.

821
00:53:10,587 --> 00:53:11,679
Sure.

822
00:53:11,755 --> 00:53:13,484
Jim, go on, jump into bed.

823
00:53:13,557 --> 00:53:14,819
-Oh!
-Quick kicks!

824
00:53:14,891 --> 00:53:16,688
Dad'll be there in a minute.

825
00:53:18,261 --> 00:53:20,388
So what's he reading?

826
00:53:20,463 --> 00:53:21,862
It's on his bedside table.

827
00:53:22,899 --> 00:53:24,025
Right.

828
00:53:25,101 --> 00:53:26,762
About tomorrow...

829
00:53:26,836 --> 00:53:28,064
I'm in the office all day.

830
00:53:28,138 --> 00:53:29,935
It's just, I need
to keep looking for work.

831
00:53:30,006 --> 00:53:32,031
I thought you were going
to make calls from home.

832
00:53:32,108 --> 00:53:33,302
Well, l-I just should go in.

833
00:53:33,376 --> 00:53:34,468
Half the city is looking.

834
00:53:34,544 --> 00:53:35,943
I can't compete
unless I'm there.

835
00:53:36,046 --> 00:53:38,207
Can't your father call somebody?

836
00:53:38,281 --> 00:53:40,943
He's already done
everything he can.

837
00:53:41,017 --> 00:53:42,746
Dad lost everything
in the market crash,

838
00:53:42,819 --> 00:53:43,751
like everybody else.

839
00:53:43,820 --> 00:53:44,946
I know that.

840
00:53:45,088 --> 00:53:46,749
I know, I'm sorry.

841
00:53:46,823 --> 00:53:47,755
I'm sorry.

842
00:53:47,824 --> 00:53:49,451
So...

843
00:53:49,526 --> 00:53:51,653
I think I should go in.

844
00:53:51,728 --> 00:53:53,195
Henry, I arranged meetings,

845
00:53:53,263 --> 00:53:55,629
especially because you said
you'd do the school run.

846
00:53:55,699 --> 00:53:57,530
Well, can't we ask someone?

847
00:53:57,601 --> 00:53:59,091
There must be people
at his school...

848
00:53:59,169 --> 00:54:00,033
You call.

849
00:54:00,103 --> 00:54:01,832
I'm sick of asking for favors.

850
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:04,702
Don't. Don't!

851
00:54:04,774 --> 00:54:06,708
You didn't bother doing it
in the first place,

852
00:54:06,776 --> 00:54:07,708
don't do it now.

853
00:54:07,777 --> 00:54:08,709
I was trying to help.

854
00:54:08,778 --> 00:54:09,710
No, you were bargaining.

855
00:54:09,779 --> 00:54:11,007
What if I was?

856
00:54:12,849 --> 00:54:14,612
Is that a crime?

857
00:54:14,684 --> 00:54:17,380
You know, because I can argue...

858
00:54:17,454 --> 00:54:18,921
I can shout.

859
00:54:20,624 --> 00:54:22,216
I hate this situation.

860
00:54:22,292 --> 00:54:25,090
I hate not having a job.

861
00:54:25,161 --> 00:54:26,321
I don't see what good

862
00:54:26,396 --> 00:54:29,763
it does to make each other
feel worse than we already do.

863
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:37,932
Sarah.

864
00:54:38,008 --> 00:54:40,203
Look at this room--
it's a mess.

865
00:54:40,277 --> 00:54:42,074
We'll sort it out.

866
00:54:42,145 --> 00:54:43,612
Things will pick up.

867
00:54:45,315 --> 00:54:48,148
There's a chance, I've got
a meeting with this guy

868
00:54:48,218 --> 00:54:49,515
who's really big in futures,

869
00:54:49,586 --> 00:54:52,851
and I'm going to try
and get a meeting with him.

870
00:54:54,257 --> 00:54:56,589
We will sort it out.

871
00:54:59,229 --> 00:55:02,096
He's waiting for you
to read to him.

872
00:55:08,505 --> 00:55:09,563
Okay.

873
00:55:27,190 --> 00:55:28,122
Thanks.

874
00:55:28,191 --> 00:55:29,590
I understand.

875
00:55:30,794 --> 00:55:33,422
Michael...
Michael, that's bullshit.

876
00:55:34,631 --> 00:55:38,397
UNHCR sends more aid to Honduras
than any other UN agency.

877
00:55:38,468 --> 00:55:40,459
Even as I speak...

878
00:55:40,537 --> 00:55:42,437
Well, most people don't even
know where Honduras is.

879
00:55:42,505 --> 00:55:44,097
...East and West Berliners alike
are tearing down

880
00:55:44,174 --> 00:55:45,698
the greatest symbol
of Communist repression...

881
00:55:45,775 --> 00:55:46,707
No.

882
00:55:46,776 --> 00:55:50,177
North of Panama
in the Caribbean Sea.

883
00:55:50,246 --> 00:55:52,737
But you must keep repeating it
to yourself to believe it.

884
00:55:52,816 --> 00:55:54,408
The Berlin Wall
is finally coming down.

885
00:55:54,484 --> 00:55:57,282
And the sense of hope
you get here...

886
00:55:57,354 --> 00:55:58,821
Which is precisely
why I need aid.

887
00:55:58,888 --> 00:56:00,879
November 9, 1989,

888
00:56:00,957 --> 00:56:03,187
a night that marked the opening
of a new chapter

889
00:56:03,259 --> 00:56:04,351
in world history.

890
00:56:04,427 --> 00:56:05,792
Michael,
I have to call you back.

891
00:56:05,862 --> 00:56:06,886
Okay.

892
00:56:07,030 --> 00:56:08,463
UNHCR.

893
00:56:08,531 --> 00:56:09,623
Sarah?

894
00:56:09,699 --> 00:56:10,996
Yes. Who's calling?

895
00:56:11,067 --> 00:56:12,898
Uh, it's me, Elliott.

896
00:56:13,036 --> 00:56:14,560
Elliott?

897
00:56:14,637 --> 00:56:15,899
Hi.

898
00:56:16,039 --> 00:56:17,131
Hi!

899
00:56:17,207 --> 00:56:19,038
How... how are you?
Are you okay?

900
00:56:19,109 --> 00:56:20,041
Oh, oh, yeah.

901
00:56:20,110 --> 00:56:21,042
Where are you?

902
00:56:21,111 --> 00:56:23,409
Um, Oh, I'm actually,
believe it or not,

903
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:26,244
I'm here in a phone booth
in-in London.

904
00:56:26,316 --> 00:56:28,250
Oh, my God.

905
00:56:28,318 --> 00:56:30,149
You know, I'm sorry,
there's a terrible connection...

906
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:32,188
but nothing seems to work
in this shitty place.

907
00:56:32,255 --> 00:56:33,347
When can I see you?

908
00:56:33,423 --> 00:56:35,687
Oh, uh, well, um...

909
00:56:35,759 --> 00:56:38,694
I'm in the Holland Park
Tube Station right now.

910
00:56:38,762 --> 00:56:41,026
Uh, could you meet me
by the entrance to the park?

911
00:56:41,097 --> 00:56:42,257
Yeah.

912
00:56:42,332 --> 00:56:44,129
-Oh...
-Yes, yes, of course!

913
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:45,462
-Great.
-Um, uh...

914
00:56:45,535 --> 00:56:47,628
1 :30, is that... is that okay?

915
00:56:47,704 --> 00:56:48,693
Sounds perfect.

916
00:57:06,189 --> 00:57:07,281
Henry?

917
00:57:07,357 --> 00:57:08,289
Hi, honey.

918
00:57:08,358 --> 00:57:09,848
Bea just popped around
to say hello.

919
00:57:09,926 --> 00:57:11,894
Do you remember Bea?
She used to work with Dad.

920
00:57:12,028 --> 00:57:13,017
Hi, there.

921
00:57:13,096 --> 00:57:14,393
Hi.

922
00:57:15,765 --> 00:57:17,790
I thought you had job interviews
today.

923
00:57:17,867 --> 00:57:20,529
Uh, they all got canceled.

924
00:57:20,603 --> 00:57:21,763
Oh.

925
00:57:26,075 --> 00:57:28,373
I-I just came by to get
some warm stuff for Jimmy,

926
00:57:28,445 --> 00:57:29,912
so I'm going to go pick him up.

927
00:57:44,360 --> 00:57:46,055
Hello.

928
00:57:51,367 --> 00:57:52,857
Hey.

929
00:57:52,936 --> 00:57:54,198
He-He-Hey.

930
00:57:54,270 --> 00:57:55,794
Oh...

931
00:57:55,872 --> 00:57:58,432
Oh, my gosh.
Look at you.

932
00:57:58,508 --> 00:58:00,203
Here, come, sit.

933
00:58:02,512 --> 00:58:04,605
Oh, gosh, it's good to see you.

934
00:58:04,681 --> 00:58:05,978
Well, you, too.

935
00:58:06,049 --> 00:58:08,517
So you got my last letter?

936
00:58:08,585 --> 00:58:10,348
Yeah. You were in Pakistan.

937
00:58:10,420 --> 00:58:11,512
Pakistan?

938
00:58:11,588 --> 00:58:13,180
That was months ago.

939
00:58:13,256 --> 00:58:14,188
Haven't l...?

940
00:58:14,257 --> 00:58:15,884
You've been busy saving lives.

941
00:58:15,992 --> 00:58:17,619
It's okay, I forgive you.

942
00:58:17,694 --> 00:58:21,027
Well... well, we're not
in Pakistan anymore.

943
00:58:21,097 --> 00:58:24,066
We're in Cambodia,
by the Thai border.

944
00:58:25,935 --> 00:58:27,835
You okay?

945
00:58:28,872 --> 00:58:30,396
How's home?

946
00:58:30,473 --> 00:58:31,565
Fine.

947
00:58:31,641 --> 00:58:33,404
Jimmy?

948
00:58:33,476 --> 00:58:34,909
Gorgeous.

949
00:58:35,011 --> 00:58:36,672
But bien sur.

950
00:58:36,746 --> 00:58:42,116
So, you're in London, and you
called me out of the blue.

951
00:58:42,185 --> 00:58:45,120
Is that because I'm with the
United Nations or just because

952
00:58:45,188 --> 00:58:47,452
I'd never forgive you
if you didn't?

953
00:58:47,524 --> 00:58:48,923
Both.

954
00:58:50,393 --> 00:58:51,485
T ell me.

955
00:58:51,561 --> 00:58:54,689
What do you know
about Cambodia?

956
00:58:54,764 --> 00:58:57,699
There's a civil war going on,

957
00:58:57,767 --> 00:59:00,861
Communist coalition forces
headed by the Khmer Rouge

958
00:59:00,937 --> 00:59:03,497
versus Communist Vietnamese
running the government.

959
00:59:03,573 --> 00:59:05,700
I believe the British
calls it political irony.

960
00:59:05,775 --> 00:59:08,642
Yeah. Well, Nick calls
it a clusterfuck.

961
00:59:08,711 --> 00:59:09,837
But that's Nick,

962
00:59:09,913 --> 00:59:11,813
not one that minces words.

963
00:59:11,881 --> 00:59:13,815
How is he?

964
00:59:13,883 --> 00:59:15,510
Is he good?

965
00:59:17,020 --> 00:59:18,885
He's Nick.

966
00:59:19,022 --> 00:59:21,513
Was it his idea for you
to come here?

967
00:59:21,591 --> 00:59:23,889
No. No, both of us.

968
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:26,758
I mean, l... I wanted
to see you anyway,

969
00:59:26,829 --> 00:59:30,629
and you know,
I always do this...

970
00:59:30,700 --> 00:59:33,168
Nick can't pitch to...
save his life.

971
00:59:33,236 --> 00:59:35,466
Well, you saw that.

972
00:59:35,538 --> 00:59:37,836
Sorry, where, where,
where was l?

973
00:59:37,907 --> 00:59:39,135
Cambodia.

974
00:59:39,208 --> 00:59:40,470
Ah, right.

975
00:59:40,543 --> 00:59:42,909
Well...
according to Washington,

976
00:59:43,046 --> 00:59:44,536
the place doesn't
officially exist,

977
00:59:44,614 --> 00:59:46,912
although there's something
like half a million people

978
00:59:46,983 --> 00:59:48,883
living under Khmer Rouge
domination.

979
00:59:48,952 --> 00:59:50,044
Dysentery, measles,

980
00:59:50,119 --> 00:59:52,144
pneumonia,
no vaccines, of course,

981
00:59:52,221 --> 00:59:54,917
so death rates run
15 to 20 people a day

982
00:59:54,991 --> 00:59:58,518
in every village, and there's
land mines, lots of them.

983
00:59:58,595 --> 01:00:01,655
So, we have amputees
without prosthetics.

984
01:00:01,731 --> 01:00:03,221
It's not a happy place.

985
01:00:03,299 --> 01:00:04,561
So what do you need?

986
01:00:04,634 --> 01:00:06,602
Well, I put together
a shipment of supplies,

987
01:00:06,669 --> 01:00:08,637
vaccines, medicines, the usual.

988
01:00:08,705 --> 01:00:13,267
But there's so much corruption
out there, I was wondering,

989
01:00:13,343 --> 01:00:15,368
I mean, the thing
would be if...

990
01:00:15,445 --> 01:00:17,936
Elliott, just...
just say it.

991
01:00:18,081 --> 01:00:21,573
If we could put
a UN stamp on it.

992
01:00:21,651 --> 01:00:24,245
I mean, the point is, the UN
name still means something.

993
01:00:24,320 --> 01:00:26,083
You know, just a little bit
of extra protection.

994
01:00:26,155 --> 01:00:27,952
Obviously, I would take
full responsibility.

995
01:00:28,091 --> 01:00:29,683
You just do
the paperwork.

996
01:00:29,759 --> 01:00:33,354
Well, we do have shipments going
into Thailand and Cambodia.

997
01:00:33,429 --> 01:00:36,921
So, I'll attach your name
to the list.

998
01:00:38,401 --> 01:00:39,333
Thank you.

999
01:00:39,402 --> 01:00:40,926
And I'll go with it.
I'll see it through.

1000
01:00:41,004 --> 01:00:42,096
Oh, no, you don't need to.

1001
01:00:42,171 --> 01:00:43,763
I know, but I do this now.

1002
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:45,967
Yeah, but Cambodia
is different.

1003
01:00:46,109 --> 01:00:48,077
I'll see it through.

1004
01:01:10,833 --> 01:01:12,266
So, what is it,
what do they want?

1005
01:01:12,335 --> 01:01:13,267
Money, Miss Sarah.

1006
01:01:13,336 --> 01:01:15,304
Shit! They see you,
they want more.

1007
01:01:15,371 --> 01:01:16,633
Always more money, huh?!

1008
01:01:20,877 --> 01:01:22,310
-I'm not playing their games.
-What?

1009
01:01:22,378 --> 01:01:23,811
I'm not giving them
any more money.

1010
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:24,904
They want their money.

1011
01:01:24,981 --> 01:01:26,812
They've already gotten
the ten percent

1012
01:01:26,883 --> 01:01:29,113
-that's written in the contract.
-Contract shit, you pay.

1013
01:01:31,220 --> 01:01:32,653
-No.
-Miss Sarah.

1014
01:01:32,722 --> 01:01:34,314
I'm not giving them
any more money.

1015
01:01:34,390 --> 01:01:36,153
They need more, you pay.
You no say no.

1016
01:01:36,225 --> 01:01:37,817
T ell them to get the
rest of that shipment

1017
01:01:37,894 --> 01:01:39,418
-off the boat right now.
-What? Or what?

1018
01:01:39,495 --> 01:01:40,427
What you do?

1019
01:01:40,496 --> 01:01:41,827
This not Chelsea football.

1020
01:01:41,898 --> 01:01:42,956
This Cambodia.

1021
01:01:43,099 --> 01:01:44,999
You pay. You pay!

1022
01:02:02,351 --> 01:02:03,613
It's two weeks late.

1023
01:02:03,686 --> 01:02:05,176
What the hell
is going on, Steiger?

1024
01:02:06,889 --> 01:02:07,821
You want a beer?

1025
01:02:07,890 --> 01:02:09,517
I want to know what's going on.

1026
01:02:10,927 --> 01:02:12,895
Crates were late, so...

1027
01:02:12,962 --> 01:02:13,894
Shit happens. So what?

1028
01:02:13,963 --> 01:02:15,191
Have you got any idea how fast

1029
01:02:15,264 --> 01:02:17,061
a measles epidemic
spreads in two weeks?

1030
01:02:17,133 --> 01:02:19,226
I've got enough stains
in my laundry, Callahan.

1031
01:02:19,302 --> 01:02:21,031
You're not my only child.

1032
01:02:22,338 --> 01:02:23,965
Just give me the money.

1033
01:02:27,677 --> 01:02:30,646
Bringing your titty
from the UN was a smart idea.

1034
01:02:32,181 --> 01:02:34,411
You want to screw?
Take your pick.

1035
01:02:39,322 --> 01:02:40,414
Twenty-five thousand.

1036
01:02:40,490 --> 01:02:43,152
And tell that sorry excuse
for a colonel

1037
01:02:43,226 --> 01:02:45,956
that it's 25 more
than he deserves.

1038
01:02:47,997 --> 01:02:48,964
Mrs. Bauford is waiting.

1039
01:02:49,031 --> 01:02:49,963
Listen, you piece of shit.

1040
01:02:50,032 --> 01:02:51,124
Fucking with me is one thing,

1041
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:52,360
but if anything happens
to her...

1042
01:02:52,435 --> 01:02:53,527
Then what?

1043
01:02:53,603 --> 01:02:56,800
Remember, Callahan, I'm the guy
that makes you possible.

1044
01:02:56,873 --> 01:02:59,535
You owe me, you took
the fucking money,

1045
01:02:59,609 --> 01:03:02,169
now you will do this,
and you will do this right.

1046
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:06,544
What's the matter?
Scared of the dark?

1047
01:03:08,284 --> 01:03:10,616
Now fuck off and save lives.

1048
01:03:57,567 --> 01:03:59,933
How'd that happen?

1049
01:04:00,002 --> 01:04:02,129
If I can ask.

1050
01:04:03,773 --> 01:04:05,434
Oh.

1051
01:04:05,508 --> 01:04:07,339
Before time,

1052
01:04:07,410 --> 01:04:11,346
I was sick, bad lung, TB.

1053
01:04:11,414 --> 01:04:14,008
At this time no doctor
where I live.

1054
01:04:14,083 --> 01:04:16,051
Khmer Rouge kill our doctor.

1055
01:04:16,118 --> 01:04:19,918
So, I walk to border
for medicine,

1056
01:04:20,022 --> 01:04:24,391
but I must cross
the mine field first.

1057
01:04:24,460 --> 01:04:26,724
You never forget that sound.

1058
01:04:26,796 --> 01:04:29,162
The first thing you hear
is click.

1059
01:04:29,232 --> 01:04:31,894
It's your foot priming
the land mine.

1060
01:04:31,968 --> 01:04:33,458
Soon as you hear it,

1061
01:04:33,536 --> 01:04:36,505
it's over.

1062
01:04:36,572 --> 01:04:39,598
But your mind go crazy,
you know?

1063
01:04:39,675 --> 01:04:42,542
You thinking, maybe if I jump,

1064
01:04:42,612 --> 01:04:46,446
maybe if I find a rock
to match my weight...

1065
01:04:46,515 --> 01:04:50,576
But it's nothing you can do.

1066
01:04:50,653 --> 01:04:53,588
You hear the click
and big bye-bye.

1067
01:04:53,656 --> 01:04:55,317
But,

1068
01:04:55,391 --> 01:04:57,484
I was lucky.

1069
01:04:57,560 --> 01:04:59,084
Just lose my leg.

1070
01:05:27,056 --> 01:05:28,489
Any problems?

1071
01:05:28,557 --> 01:05:30,149
None.

1072
01:05:49,679 --> 01:05:51,806
You're not wearing perfume.

1073
01:06:04,860 --> 01:06:09,456
So, are you going to tell me
where we're going?

1074
01:06:11,033 --> 01:06:12,796
A place near Pailin,

1075
01:06:12,868 --> 01:06:14,836
by the border.

1076
01:06:14,904 --> 01:06:17,338
And the boat's
the best way to travel?

1077
01:06:17,406 --> 01:06:19,340
You don't like my boat?

1078
01:06:21,777 --> 01:06:23,267
I think it's very you.

1079
01:06:25,281 --> 01:06:27,044
It's safer.

1080
01:06:28,317 --> 01:06:29,750
Avoids the road blocks,

1081
01:06:29,819 --> 01:06:33,721
the Viet troops,
plus other assorted madness.

1082
01:06:33,789 --> 01:06:36,519
You know, heart of darkness.

1083
01:06:36,592 --> 01:06:37,752
The horror.

1084
01:06:40,096 --> 01:06:42,223
Actually it is.

1085
01:06:42,298 --> 01:06:43,697
Horrible.

1086
01:06:43,766 --> 01:06:45,893
And now you're going
to tell me why.

1087
01:06:45,968 --> 01:06:47,367
Well, Elliott's no good, is he?

1088
01:06:47,436 --> 01:06:49,666
All he gives you is
the Buddhist version,

1089
01:06:49,739 --> 01:06:50,797
all fucking temples

1090
01:06:50,873 --> 01:06:54,138
and gentle people,
which is bollocks.

1091
01:06:54,210 --> 01:06:55,302
The Khmer Rouge--

1092
01:06:55,378 --> 01:06:57,642
rouge being very much
the appropriate color--

1093
01:06:57,713 --> 01:06:59,112
used Pailin as a hideout.

1094
01:06:59,181 --> 01:07:01,411
Everyone lives
in absolute terror.

1095
01:07:01,484 --> 01:07:03,714
They use the women
as baby-making factories,

1096
01:07:03,786 --> 01:07:05,083
the kids as mine sweepers,

1097
01:07:05,154 --> 01:07:07,281
and just in case
we actually help anybody,

1098
01:07:07,356 --> 01:07:08,880
they come and steal everything

1099
01:07:08,991 --> 01:07:10,083
that we don't hide.

1100
01:07:10,159 --> 01:07:12,184
So why do they let you
stay at all?

1101
01:07:12,261 --> 01:07:14,422
They've got no doctors.

1102
01:07:20,836 --> 01:07:22,770
I should be singing
"Old Man River."

1103
01:07:25,674 --> 01:07:26,834
Please don't.

1104
01:08:27,570 --> 01:08:30,596
Colonel Tao,
how are you doing?

1105
01:08:31,640 --> 01:08:33,574
It's good to see you again.

1106
01:08:45,521 --> 01:08:47,580
The boxes, they for who?

1107
01:08:47,656 --> 01:08:50,124
Well, you know who they're for.

1108
01:08:50,192 --> 01:08:51,284
I give you my word.

1109
01:08:51,360 --> 01:08:52,987
This goes only
to the women and children.

1110
01:08:58,834 --> 01:09:02,167
Wait, easy, that's medicine,
for Christ's sake!

1111
01:09:22,024 --> 01:09:23,355
I don't understand,
what's the problem?

1112
01:09:28,397 --> 01:09:29,329
It's a laptop.

1113
01:09:29,398 --> 01:09:30,626
Every NGO has got one.

1114
01:09:30,699 --> 01:09:32,257
That's the way
we do business here.

1115
01:09:32,334 --> 01:09:33,892
Don't throw those away.

1116
01:09:34,036 --> 01:09:36,971
People's lives depend on that,
for fuck's sake!

1117
01:09:42,611 --> 01:09:43,543
-Colonel...
-Sarah...

1118
01:09:43,612 --> 01:09:44,544
I'm with UNHCR, United Nations.

1119
01:09:44,613 --> 01:09:45,773
This cargo is protected.

1120
01:09:45,848 --> 01:09:47,713
If this shipment is harmed
in any way,

1121
01:09:47,783 --> 01:09:49,307
your name will surface
in the follow-up investigation.

1122
01:09:49,385 --> 01:09:50,352
I don't...

1123
01:10:16,412 --> 01:10:18,505
I promise you,
I know nothing about this.

1124
01:10:18,581 --> 01:10:19,639
Somebody must have...

1125
01:10:40,970 --> 01:10:42,597
Colonel Tao, you know me.

1126
01:10:42,671 --> 01:10:43,763
I swear to God,

1127
01:10:43,839 --> 01:10:45,033
I don't...

1128
01:11:01,490 --> 01:11:04,118
Son of a bitch!

1129
01:12:19,034 --> 01:12:19,932
What was that?

1130
01:12:20,035 --> 01:12:21,093
You explain it to me.

1131
01:12:21,170 --> 01:12:22,467
I can't explain it to you.

1132
01:12:22,538 --> 01:12:23,470
We were set up.

1133
01:12:23,539 --> 01:12:24,665
I knew nothing about that book,

1134
01:12:24,740 --> 01:12:26,139
what was in the box,
the equipment...

1135
01:12:26,208 --> 01:12:28,768
Did you know about the guns?

1136
01:12:28,844 --> 01:12:31,438
Did you know about the guns?

1137
01:12:31,513 --> 01:12:32,741
Answer me!
Did you know...?

1138
01:12:32,815 --> 01:12:33,941
Yes, I knew about them.

1139
01:12:35,718 --> 01:12:37,185
I came here
to help these people,

1140
01:12:37,252 --> 01:12:38,617
and the only way
I can do that

1141
01:12:38,687 --> 01:12:40,348
-is if I transport guns.
-You don't have

1142
01:12:40,422 --> 01:12:41,616
to transport guns
to help people.

1143
01:12:41,690 --> 01:12:42,782
You do here.

1144
01:12:42,858 --> 01:12:44,655
Right. So fuck the next person
that tries to bring

1145
01:12:44,727 --> 01:12:46,217
a shipment full of medicine
in for people.

1146
01:12:46,295 --> 01:12:48,263
Fuck them.

1147
01:12:48,330 --> 01:12:49,490
As long as you get
what you need today,

1148
01:12:49,565 --> 01:12:50,657
fuck everybody else!

1149
01:12:50,733 --> 01:12:51,825
No one else comes here,

1150
01:12:51,900 --> 01:12:53,128
so what do you want me to do?

1151
01:12:53,202 --> 01:12:55,500
You want me to watch
thousands of kids die of measles

1152
01:12:55,571 --> 01:12:56,970
'cause I wouldn't
bend the rules?

1153
01:12:57,039 --> 01:12:58,233
Is that a price worth paying?

1154
01:12:58,307 --> 01:13:00,138
Or am I actually killing
more than I save?

1155
01:13:00,209 --> 01:13:02,507
You seriously believe that
I don't worry about that?

1156
01:13:02,578 --> 01:13:05,046
That I don't think about that
every minute of every day?

1157
01:13:05,114 --> 01:13:07,446
What's worse?
You tell me.

1158
01:13:07,516 --> 01:13:09,575
You tell me what I should do.

1159
01:13:29,405 --> 01:13:30,804
What happened?

1160
01:13:50,926 --> 01:13:53,326
Never compromise
another organization

1161
01:13:53,395 --> 01:13:55,955
for your own ever again.

1162
01:13:56,064 --> 01:13:58,464
I won't.

1163
01:13:59,568 --> 01:14:01,058
Sarah, you made it.

1164
01:14:01,136 --> 01:14:02,763
Oh, good to see you.

1165
01:14:02,838 --> 01:14:06,330
So, I believe congratulations
are in order?

1166
01:14:06,408 --> 01:14:08,342
I know, can you believe it?

1167
01:14:08,410 --> 01:14:09,342
Oh...

1168
01:14:09,411 --> 01:14:11,072
What the hell happened?

1169
01:14:11,146 --> 01:14:13,307
No guns--
confiscated by Tao.

1170
01:14:13,382 --> 01:14:15,816
He found
these intelligence files.

1171
01:14:15,884 --> 01:14:17,408
They freaked him out.

1172
01:14:17,486 --> 01:14:18,418
What intelligence files?

1173
01:14:18,487 --> 01:14:19,579
Well, how do I know?

1174
01:14:19,655 --> 01:14:20,883
He was tipped off.
He was waiting for us.

1175
01:14:20,956 --> 01:14:22,446
He found these documents.
He went fucking crazy.

1176
01:14:22,524 --> 01:14:24,685
Well, if we don't have anything
for the Khmer Rouge,

1177
01:14:24,760 --> 01:14:25,692
we're in deep shit.

1178
01:14:25,761 --> 01:14:26,693
We leave in the morning.

1179
01:14:26,762 --> 01:14:27,786
Take everyone with us.

1180
01:14:27,863 --> 01:14:29,023
No, we need to leave
sooner than that.

1181
01:14:29,097 --> 01:14:30,928
We've got all this vaccine.
I'm not wasting it.

1182
01:14:31,033 --> 01:14:32,660
We don't have time.
We need to go now.

1183
01:14:32,734 --> 01:14:33,928
Not until we vaccinate.

1184
01:14:34,002 --> 01:14:36,368
This is not worth risking
our lives for.

1185
01:14:37,439 --> 01:14:40,966
You do whatever you got to do.
I'm staying.

1186
01:15:01,663 --> 01:15:03,392
Joss, remember to pack
the iodine.

1187
01:15:03,465 --> 01:15:05,695
And the emergency kits--
how many we got?

1188
01:15:05,767 --> 01:15:06,893
Joss?

1189
01:15:20,949 --> 01:15:21,916
No, no. They...

1190
01:15:23,318 --> 01:15:27,220
He says that we're thieves,
that we stole his files

1191
01:15:27,289 --> 01:15:29,553
and his guns,
and he wants them back.

1192
01:15:29,625 --> 01:15:31,616
T ell him the truth.

1193
01:15:31,693 --> 01:15:33,354
And tell him that we're trying

1194
01:15:33,428 --> 01:15:35,362
to save his bloody people.

1195
01:15:42,671 --> 01:15:45,196
He doesn't give a shit
about the people.

1196
01:15:45,274 --> 01:15:46,707
He just want the file.

1197
01:15:46,775 --> 01:15:48,174
So tell him whatever he wants.

1198
01:15:48,243 --> 01:15:50,871
Just try and buy us
some time.

1199
01:16:01,890 --> 01:16:02,879
He wants us to...

1200
01:16:02,991 --> 01:16:03,980
He wants us to what?

1201
01:16:05,661 --> 01:16:08,027
He wants us to make amends now.

1202
01:16:08,096 --> 01:16:10,394
He wants us to go to Pailin.

1203
01:16:10,465 --> 01:16:11,693
You know what that means.

1204
01:16:12,734 --> 01:16:13,666
He say now.

1205
01:16:13,735 --> 01:16:14,667
Okay.

1206
01:16:14,736 --> 01:16:18,467
T ell him that Sarah
is from the UN.

1207
01:16:18,540 --> 01:16:20,440
And that the UN is very
important to Big God Ankha,

1208
01:16:20,509 --> 01:16:22,500
and if anything happens to her
or to us,

1209
01:16:22,578 --> 01:16:23,772
the UN will crucify him.

1210
01:16:36,325 --> 01:16:40,125
He say you are a ClA agent
working for Vietnam.

1211
01:16:40,195 --> 01:16:43,562
One of you must die.

1212
01:16:55,978 --> 01:17:00,438
English doctor, you say
all you care about is my people.

1213
01:17:36,551 --> 01:17:38,815
Life mean nothing.

1214
01:17:38,887 --> 01:17:41,014
We serve only Ankha.

1215
01:17:41,089 --> 01:17:42,920
Now you will see.

1216
01:17:43,025 --> 01:17:44,617
For God's sake,
he's just a baby.

1217
01:17:52,067 --> 01:17:52,931
T ell them to drop their guns.

1218
01:17:54,202 --> 01:17:56,261
T ell them to drop
their fucking weapons now!

1219
01:17:57,572 --> 01:17:59,164
No!

1220
01:17:59,241 --> 01:18:00,731
T ell them to back off.
Back off!

1221
01:18:06,114 --> 01:18:07,547
T ell them to back off.

1222
01:18:07,616 --> 01:18:08,514
T ell them to back off.

1223
01:20:22,417 --> 01:20:24,715
Look, as long
as we hold due west,

1224
01:20:24,786 --> 01:20:26,151
we hit the river.

1225
01:20:26,221 --> 01:20:27,552
That's about two miles.

1226
01:20:27,622 --> 01:20:28,953
And the camp's up there.

1227
01:20:29,090 --> 01:20:31,456
About another three miles north,
just over the Thai border.

1228
01:20:31,526 --> 01:20:33,494
Oh, Jesus.

1229
01:20:33,562 --> 01:20:35,120
Shit. That's Khmer Rouge.

1230
01:20:35,197 --> 01:20:36,357
They've reached the village.

1231
01:20:36,431 --> 01:20:38,194
At this rate,
they're going to catch up.

1232
01:21:06,394 --> 01:21:08,157
Keep them moving.

1233
01:21:08,230 --> 01:21:09,663
Keep them moving!

1234
01:21:10,999 --> 01:21:12,398
T ell them we're nearly there.

1235
01:21:17,539 --> 01:21:18,904
Sierra Tango 619.

1236
01:21:20,675 --> 01:21:22,233
Sierra Tango 619.

1237
01:21:22,310 --> 01:21:25,006
This is Outpost Grade Seven.

1238
01:21:29,651 --> 01:21:31,551
Sierra Tango, come in.

1239
01:21:47,302 --> 01:21:50,294
Me father.
Me father.

1240
01:22:06,021 --> 01:22:09,218
Look! Look! Helicopter!

1241
01:22:09,291 --> 01:22:11,259
Helicopter!

1242
01:22:12,560 --> 01:22:14,824
Helicopter!

1243
01:22:22,704 --> 01:22:24,296
Looks Vietnamese, mate.

1244
01:22:24,372 --> 01:22:27,239
Good, that will keep them busy.

1245
01:22:59,441 --> 01:23:01,875
Nick?

1246
01:23:07,515 --> 01:23:09,506
It wasn't your fault.

1247
01:23:09,584 --> 01:23:10,915
Yes, it was.

1248
01:23:11,052 --> 01:23:12,485
If I'd have listened to him,

1249
01:23:12,554 --> 01:23:16,320
none of this
would have happened.

1250
01:23:16,391 --> 01:23:18,552
I couldn't even
bury him properly.

1251
01:23:18,626 --> 01:23:21,493
I didn't even give him
a decent fucking burial.

1252
01:23:21,563 --> 01:23:24,225
Elliott wanted to dedicate
his life

1253
01:23:24,299 --> 01:23:26,927
to helping other people.

1254
01:23:27,068 --> 01:23:30,469
And in the end,
he died for them.

1255
01:23:30,538 --> 01:23:33,200
Be proud of him.

1256
01:23:33,274 --> 01:23:39,941
Miss him...
but be proud of him.

1257
01:23:40,048 --> 01:23:46,612
I don't know what
I'm going to do without him.

1258
01:23:46,688 --> 01:23:50,954
I can't stop;
I've got to keep going.

1259
01:23:51,059 --> 01:23:55,052
-There's so much...
-I'm worried about you, here.

1260
01:23:55,130 --> 01:23:59,191
I'm worried that something
is going to happen to you.

1261
01:23:59,267 --> 01:24:01,064
Every day for four years,

1262
01:24:01,136 --> 01:24:03,229
every morning,
I wake up and I wonder

1263
01:24:03,304 --> 01:24:04,896
if you're okay,
if you're still alive,

1264
01:24:05,006 --> 01:24:06,098
where you are.

1265
01:25:04,666 --> 01:25:07,863
Shall I ring down
for some room service?

1266
01:25:07,936 --> 01:25:11,667
Chocolate cake...

1267
01:25:11,739 --> 01:25:13,297
and some air-conditioning.

1268
01:25:13,374 --> 01:25:15,706
That'd be lovely.

1269
01:25:20,748 --> 01:25:24,582
How did you meet Henry?

1270
01:25:24,652 --> 01:25:27,120
I was staring at a Roscoe.

1271
01:25:27,188 --> 01:25:29,656
What's that,
some sort of dishwasher?

1272
01:25:29,724 --> 01:25:31,191
It was a painting.

1273
01:25:31,259 --> 01:25:33,921
I used to work
at an art gallery.

1274
01:25:34,028 --> 01:25:37,327
And one day, Henry came in.

1275
01:25:37,398 --> 01:25:39,889
How old were you?

1276
01:25:39,968 --> 01:25:43,096
Too young.

1277
01:25:43,171 --> 01:25:47,540
But you stayed together?

1278
01:25:47,609 --> 01:25:50,544
Yeah.

1279
01:25:50,612 --> 01:25:53,638
We've both known that
the marriage has been over

1280
01:25:53,715 --> 01:25:54,704
for a long time.

1281
01:25:54,782 --> 01:25:58,616
But we stayed together
for Jimmy.

1282
01:25:58,686 --> 01:26:01,018
You love him very much,
don't you?

1283
01:26:01,089 --> 01:26:04,081
He's amazing.

1284
01:26:28,516 --> 01:26:30,313
I'm going to have
to start making plans

1285
01:26:30,385 --> 01:26:32,285
to go to New York.

1286
01:26:32,353 --> 01:26:36,050
See Elliott's parents,
tell them what happened.

1287
01:26:36,124 --> 01:26:37,352
How long will you be gone?

1288
01:26:37,425 --> 01:26:39,723
I don't know, no idea.

1289
01:26:43,731 --> 01:26:46,256
What is this?

1290
01:26:49,637 --> 01:26:51,161
What are you doing?

1291
01:26:51,239 --> 01:26:54,106
I'm absolutely crazy about you.

1292
01:26:54,175 --> 01:26:56,837
I can't stop thinking about you.

1293
01:26:56,911 --> 01:26:59,038
You're always in my mind;
you're in my heart;

1294
01:26:59,113 --> 01:27:01,377
you're in every fucking bit
of me.

1295
01:27:01,449 --> 01:27:03,474
But I can't go there with you.

1296
01:27:03,551 --> 01:27:04,711
I can't do it.

1297
01:27:04,786 --> 01:27:06,447
Look at what happens
to people around me.

1298
01:27:06,521 --> 01:27:07,510
It's not good.

1299
01:27:07,589 --> 01:27:09,022
-I'm not good for you.
-That's not true.

1300
01:27:09,090 --> 01:27:11,183
Listen, believe me,
if I could live this life again,

1301
01:27:11,259 --> 01:27:12,817
I would never leave you
for a second.

1302
01:27:12,894 --> 01:27:15,021
But you belong with your family,
and I belong here,

1303
01:27:15,096 --> 01:27:17,030
and there's nothing
we can do about it.

1304
01:27:17,098 --> 01:27:18,588
Because whichever way
you look at it,

1305
01:27:18,666 --> 01:27:19,633
somebody gets hurt.

1306
01:27:58,503 --> 01:28:01,961
One, two, three.

1307
01:28:02,540 --> 01:28:03,837
-Oh.
-Oops.

1308
01:28:15,987 --> 01:28:17,181
Oh!

1309
01:28:23,895 --> 01:28:27,854
Happy birthday to you

1310
01:28:27,932 --> 01:28:31,663
Happy birthday
to you

1311
01:28:31,736 --> 01:28:35,763
Happy birthday, dear Sarah

1312
01:28:35,840 --> 01:28:40,641
Happy birthday to you.

1313
01:28:42,314 --> 01:28:44,145
Thank you.

1314
01:28:47,819 --> 01:28:49,286
Thank you, baby.

1315
01:28:49,354 --> 01:28:51,652
Oh, that was lovely.

1316
01:28:51,723 --> 01:28:54,191
Lovely playing, lovely cake.

1317
01:28:54,259 --> 01:28:55,317
My playing

1318
01:28:55,393 --> 01:28:56,860
was lovelier than his cake.

1319
01:28:56,928 --> 01:28:57,917
Mom.

1320
01:28:58,063 --> 01:29:00,122
They were both exactly
as lovely as each other.

1321
01:29:00,198 --> 01:29:02,029
I think you better
blow the candles out

1322
01:29:02,100 --> 01:29:03,124
before the cake catches fire.

1323
01:29:03,201 --> 01:29:05,863
Wait until they do you
a candle for each decade, dear.

1324
01:29:05,970 --> 01:29:08,598
Then you'll know
you're past it.

1325
01:29:13,678 --> 01:29:15,339
Didn't forget to make a wish.

1326
01:29:17,882 --> 01:29:19,042
Got it.

1327
01:29:20,418 --> 01:29:21,442
Oh!

1328
01:29:25,590 --> 01:29:30,550
Mom, when are we going
to open the presents?

1329
01:29:30,628 --> 01:29:31,890
Now.

1330
01:29:32,030 --> 01:29:33,998
Many of you know her
from her work

1331
01:29:34,065 --> 01:29:35,862
with the Elliott Hauser
Foundation

1332
01:29:35,934 --> 01:29:38,334
for the lnternational Promotion
of Human Rights.

1333
01:29:38,403 --> 01:29:40,268
In more recent years however,

1334
01:29:40,338 --> 01:29:42,636
she has become an active
lobbyist at Whitehall

1335
01:29:42,707 --> 01:29:46,541
on issues of asylum
and refugee protection.

1336
01:29:46,611 --> 01:29:49,546
Ladies and gentlemen,
it gives me great pleasure

1337
01:29:49,614 --> 01:29:52,481
to introduce
our new spokesperson

1338
01:29:52,550 --> 01:29:54,609
for the UNHCR
in the United Kingdom,

1339
01:29:54,686 --> 01:29:57,154
Mrs. Sarah Bauford.

1340
01:30:09,834 --> 01:30:11,893
Thank you.

1341
01:30:13,505 --> 01:30:15,939
Thank you.

1342
01:30:16,007 --> 01:30:17,372
Ladies and gentlemen,

1343
01:30:17,442 --> 01:30:22,846
I feel very nervous to be
standing in front of you today.

1344
01:30:22,914 --> 01:30:25,781
I also feel very honored.

1345
01:30:25,850 --> 01:30:28,284
In particular, because
UNHCR was the organization

1346
01:30:28,353 --> 01:30:33,120
to which I was first introduced
by my friend Elliott Hauser.

1347
01:30:33,191 --> 01:30:34,681
I know that my being
offered this post

1348
01:30:34,759 --> 01:30:36,351
would have given him
enormous pleasure.

1349
01:30:36,428 --> 01:30:40,194
Over 50 million people

1350
01:30:40,265 --> 01:30:44,099
are refugees or displaced
persons in the world today.

1351
01:30:44,169 --> 01:30:47,297
And because of closed minds
and funding shortfalls,

1352
01:30:47,372 --> 01:30:50,830
we are only able to reach
half of those in need.

1353
01:30:59,684 --> 01:31:02,778
So we rely on our partners,

1354
01:31:02,854 --> 01:31:05,652
the network of aid groups
blazing a trail across crises,

1355
01:31:05,723 --> 01:31:09,454
like El Salvador, Angola,

1356
01:31:09,527 --> 01:31:12,894
Chechnya, Sri Lanka...

1357
01:31:12,964 --> 01:31:17,094
those NGO's, the non-
governmental groups from OXFAM

1358
01:31:17,168 --> 01:31:18,567
right down
to the smallest outfits

1359
01:31:18,636 --> 01:31:20,069
run by people like Elliott
and...

1360
01:31:27,412 --> 01:31:30,472
...and I pray for those
who survive him--

1361
01:31:30,548 --> 01:31:32,413
who continue his work--

1362
01:31:32,484 --> 01:31:34,952
without certainty or security--

1363
01:31:35,053 --> 01:31:37,851
wherever they may be
in this world.

1364
01:31:40,725 --> 01:31:42,249
Excuse me.

1365
01:31:54,973 --> 01:31:56,406
Hey.

1366
01:31:56,474 --> 01:31:57,736
Hey.

1367
01:31:57,809 --> 01:31:58,969
Thanks for coming.

1368
01:31:59,077 --> 01:32:00,738
Listen, I travel
thousands of miles

1369
01:32:00,812 --> 01:32:02,370
to hear my sister
give a speech,

1370
01:32:02,447 --> 01:32:03,846
I got a backache and jet lag.

1371
01:32:03,915 --> 01:32:05,439
What's a taxi ride to the park?

1372
01:32:05,517 --> 01:32:07,610
Sorry.
Are they angry?

1373
01:32:07,685 --> 01:32:09,277
No. They don't care, Sarah.

1374
01:32:09,354 --> 01:32:11,345
I think they actually
kind of enjoyed it.

1375
01:32:11,422 --> 01:32:13,788
"She's nuts" makes
for much better conversation

1376
01:32:13,858 --> 01:32:15,223
than "Nice speech."

1377
01:32:15,293 --> 01:32:17,727
I got a letter from Nick,

1378
01:32:17,795 --> 01:32:20,559
and I think he's in trouble.

1379
01:32:20,632 --> 01:32:22,691
Why? What did he say?

1380
01:32:22,767 --> 01:32:24,928
Nothing, really.
Just little things.

1381
01:32:26,204 --> 01:32:27,671
Well, where is he?

1382
01:32:27,739 --> 01:32:29,070
He's in Chechnya.

1383
01:32:29,140 --> 01:32:31,404
He's running
some sort of camp.

1384
01:32:31,476 --> 01:32:32,966
I'm really not sure.

1385
01:32:34,345 --> 01:32:35,607
I need to find him.

1386
01:32:35,680 --> 01:32:37,147
So, you have contacts.

1387
01:32:37,215 --> 01:32:39,149
You can find out where he is.

1388
01:32:39,217 --> 01:32:40,707
So, please?

1389
01:32:40,785 --> 01:32:43,117
Sarah, sweetheart,
you know as well as I do

1390
01:32:43,187 --> 01:32:46,679
that Chechnya is
a very dangerous place.

1391
01:32:53,064 --> 01:32:55,794
Yes, I can angle
a story there, I'm sure.

1392
01:32:55,867 --> 01:32:59,268
If I find out anything,
I will let you know. Okay?

1393
01:33:00,271 --> 01:33:02,637
Okay. Okay.

1394
01:33:02,707 --> 01:33:04,140
Okay.

1395
01:33:04,208 --> 01:33:05,675
Thank you.

1396
01:33:09,948 --> 01:33:13,907
Perhaps we are all refugees
from something,

1397
01:33:14,018 --> 01:33:17,283
but I see now
there is nothing to fear;

1398
01:33:17,355 --> 01:33:21,621
that the world we hold on to,
the lives we cherish,

1399
01:33:21,693 --> 01:33:26,460
are a part of something greater
--something more.

1400
01:33:26,531 --> 01:33:29,932
When I look at my children,
I see it so clearly--

1401
01:33:30,034 --> 01:33:31,626
that hope--

1402
01:33:31,703 --> 01:33:34,137
that chance of life--

1403
01:33:34,205 --> 01:33:36,503
and I know
it's worth fighting for.

1404
01:33:37,709 --> 01:33:40,303
"The wedding was
a splendid affair.

1405
01:33:40,378 --> 01:33:42,312
"Everyone attended--

1406
01:33:42,380 --> 01:33:45,144
"the dwarves, and the
animals of the forest--

1407
01:33:45,216 --> 01:33:46,740
"and there were tears of joy

1408
01:33:46,818 --> 01:33:48,115
"and songs of happiness,

1409
01:33:48,186 --> 01:33:49,949
"and the prince
and the princess

1410
01:33:50,054 --> 01:33:53,319
lived happily ever after."

1411
01:33:53,391 --> 01:33:55,951
How does it really end, Mummy?

1412
01:33:56,060 --> 01:33:57,493
What do you mean?

1413
01:33:57,562 --> 01:33:59,689
What do you think happens,
honey?

1414
01:33:59,764 --> 01:34:03,530
She wakes up,
looks at the prince,

1415
01:34:03,601 --> 01:34:06,900
and goes, "Eww! Boys. Yucky!"

1416
01:34:08,673 --> 01:34:10,106
Hello.

1417
01:34:10,174 --> 01:34:12,108
Hi, Henry. It's Charlotte.
Is Sarah there?

1418
01:34:12,176 --> 01:34:13,438
Charlotte, hi.

1419
01:34:13,511 --> 01:34:15,604
Uh... well, she's upstairs
with the kids right now.

1420
01:34:15,680 --> 01:34:16,772
Can I take a message?

1421
01:34:16,848 --> 01:34:19,544
Oh. Okay. Um...
Then could you just, uh...

1422
01:34:19,617 --> 01:34:22,916
Just let her know that
I will call her later, okay?

1423
01:34:23,021 --> 01:34:26,286
Well, I can take a message.

1424
01:34:26,357 --> 01:34:30,259
Um... well, then, just tell her
that I've got some news, uh...

1425
01:34:30,328 --> 01:34:34,287
and that I will... I will fax it
to her office in the morning.

1426
01:34:34,365 --> 01:34:35,627
Okay?

1427
01:34:35,700 --> 01:34:36,928
Right. Okay.

1428
01:34:37,035 --> 01:34:38,627
Um... I'll pass that on.

1429
01:34:38,703 --> 01:34:41,467
Okay. Thanks, Henry. Bye, now.

1430
01:34:41,539 --> 01:34:43,006
Bye.

1431
01:34:55,386 --> 01:34:57,650
That was Charlotte.

1432
01:34:57,722 --> 01:35:01,522
She said, um...
she has some news.

1433
01:35:01,592 --> 01:35:04,959
She'll fax you at the office.

1434
01:36:54,705 --> 01:36:58,766
So this is it, is it?

1435
01:36:58,843 --> 01:37:01,812
You kiss the children good-bye,
scribble a quick note, and then

1436
01:37:01,879 --> 01:37:03,312
sneak off into the night.

1437
01:37:03,381 --> 01:37:06,077
Have you any idea
how fucking cruel that is?

1438
01:37:06,150 --> 01:37:07,879
I'm not sneaking off.

1439
01:37:08,019 --> 01:37:10,579
I'm not leaving the children.

1440
01:37:10,655 --> 01:37:12,816
You could have talked to me.

1441
01:37:12,890 --> 01:37:15,620
I mean, writing a note--
it's, uh...

1442
01:37:15,693 --> 01:37:18,287
I just thought
it would be easier.

1443
01:37:18,362 --> 01:37:19,624
Than what?

1444
01:37:19,697 --> 01:37:23,224
Than having
this conversation again.

1445
01:37:26,003 --> 01:37:28,130
God, this is so...

1446
01:37:35,847 --> 01:37:38,407
I should be back by Friday.

1447
01:37:38,482 --> 01:37:41,042
Dinners are in the freezer.

1448
01:37:41,118 --> 01:37:43,484
Their swimsuits
are in the dryer.

1449
01:37:43,554 --> 01:37:46,148
They have swimming
tomorrow at 4:00.

1450
01:37:46,224 --> 01:37:48,658
It's all in the note.

1451
01:37:50,361 --> 01:37:53,524
I want this to be as easy
as possible for them.

1452
01:37:53,598 --> 01:37:55,463
And we'll talk about this.

1453
01:37:55,533 --> 01:37:58,764
We'll talk about everything
when I get home.

1454
01:39:23,287 --> 01:39:24,948
Sniper!

1455
01:39:50,214 --> 01:39:52,409
Oh, God...

1456
01:39:55,753 --> 01:39:57,050
This is total carnage,

1457
01:39:57,121 --> 01:39:58,918
and not a single western leader
has said a thing

1458
01:39:59,056 --> 01:40:00,182
about what's going on here.

1459
01:40:00,257 --> 01:40:01,622
There's no threats,
no criticism,

1460
01:40:01,692 --> 01:40:02,784
no fucking comment.

1461
01:40:02,860 --> 01:40:04,350
This place might
as well not exist.

1462
01:40:04,428 --> 01:40:05,918
And now that
we're all they have,

1463
01:40:06,030 --> 01:40:07,698
they want us to save face
for them.

1464
01:40:07,765 --> 01:40:10,199
Well, fuck that. They should
get off their fucking asses

1465
01:40:10,267 --> 01:40:12,064
and get the fuck out here. Shit.

1466
01:40:12,136 --> 01:40:13,603
Sorry. I'm still swearing.

1467
01:40:13,671 --> 01:40:15,104
Freeze it there.

1468
01:40:15,172 --> 01:40:17,299
Can we cut?

1469
01:40:25,483 --> 01:40:26,950
Okay.

1470
01:40:30,888 --> 01:40:32,321
Roll tape.

1471
01:40:32,390 --> 01:40:34,290
Basically, nothing has changed.

1472
01:40:34,358 --> 01:40:36,451
People keep saying that
everything has changed.

1473
01:40:36,527 --> 01:40:37,789
Not from where I'm standing.

1474
01:40:37,862 --> 01:40:39,124
Chechnya, Somalia, Cambodia,

1475
01:40:39,196 --> 01:40:41,528
Ethiopia--
it's the same shit every time,

1476
01:40:41,599 --> 01:40:43,897
and it's just going to go on
and on until we stop pretending

1477
01:40:43,968 --> 01:40:45,401
that our loyalty ends
with the asshole...

1478
01:41:09,026 --> 01:41:11,290
You okay?

1479
01:41:11,362 --> 01:41:13,023
What do you know?

1480
01:41:13,097 --> 01:41:15,361
An English news crew
filmed it six days ago.

1481
01:41:15,433 --> 01:41:18,027
The sound man is dead,
the cameraman is in a coma,

1482
01:41:18,102 --> 01:41:19,399
and Nick has disappeared.

1483
01:41:19,470 --> 01:41:21,199
We think it's bandits--

1484
01:41:21,272 --> 01:41:23,399
Chechens looking for money--

1485
01:41:23,474 --> 01:41:25,499
but there's been
no ransom demand.

1486
01:41:28,879 --> 01:41:31,074
Sarah, I want you
to meet Bob Strauss.

1487
01:41:31,148 --> 01:41:32,581
He's with the lCRC here.

1488
01:41:32,650 --> 01:41:34,174
He's been helping us.

1489
01:41:36,554 --> 01:41:37,816
Hi.

1490
01:41:37,888 --> 01:41:39,355
No, sit. Sit, please.

1491
01:41:43,561 --> 01:41:45,552
So, the, um...
net result right now

1492
01:41:45,629 --> 01:41:47,358
is we don't know who took Nick.

1493
01:41:47,431 --> 01:41:49,160
We don't know if he pissed off

1494
01:41:49,233 --> 01:41:50,860
the Russians or the Chechens.

1495
01:41:50,935 --> 01:41:53,062
We're pretty sure
there was a motive.

1496
01:41:53,137 --> 01:41:54,195
What was he doing?

1497
01:41:54,271 --> 01:41:55,260
I think you know

1498
01:41:55,339 --> 01:41:57,534
he wasn't just
a doctor anymore.

1499
01:41:57,608 --> 01:41:59,473
He, uh...
I'd have to say--

1500
01:41:59,543 --> 01:42:01,238
and this is well known--

1501
01:42:01,312 --> 01:42:03,712
Nick's activities
went quite a way

1502
01:42:03,781 --> 01:42:05,271
beyond what you'd call
famine relief.

1503
01:42:05,349 --> 01:42:06,281
How do we find him?

1504
01:42:06,350 --> 01:42:09,342
Well, nobody I've spoken to

1505
01:42:09,420 --> 01:42:11,479
has any leads yet.

1506
01:42:11,555 --> 01:42:13,580
Can we offer a reward?

1507
01:42:15,326 --> 01:42:18,921
Can... can...
can we do something?

1508
01:42:19,029 --> 01:42:21,463
The best thing for you
to do is to stay

1509
01:42:21,532 --> 01:42:23,727
in the hotel for
a couple of days. Be patient.

1510
01:42:23,801 --> 01:42:25,632
No. No.

1511
01:42:25,703 --> 01:42:27,466
No.

1512
01:42:27,538 --> 01:42:29,005
Sarah.

1513
01:42:30,374 --> 01:42:32,604
Sarah, listen to me.

1514
01:42:32,676 --> 01:42:34,303
This place,
they will take journalists,

1515
01:42:34,378 --> 01:42:35,811
Red Cross, anybody.

1516
01:42:35,880 --> 01:42:37,814
Don't think for one second
that you are immune.

1517
01:42:37,882 --> 01:42:39,315
I don't.

1518
01:42:39,383 --> 01:42:41,180
Just listen
to what Strauss said.

1519
01:42:41,252 --> 01:42:42,947
I don't care what Strauss said.

1520
01:42:43,053 --> 01:42:44,816
Sarah, I love you.

1521
01:42:44,889 --> 01:42:47,153
I want you to be safe. Go home.

1522
01:42:47,224 --> 01:42:49,784
I swear to God, I will let you
know if we hear anything.

1523
01:42:49,860 --> 01:42:50,792
Say it.

1524
01:42:50,861 --> 01:42:51,793
What?

1525
01:42:51,862 --> 01:42:52,920
Say it.

1526
01:42:55,733 --> 01:42:58,668
People disappear here;
they don't come back.

1527
01:42:58,736 --> 01:43:02,297
I'm not leaving
until I find him.

1528
01:43:06,510 --> 01:43:07,977
Okay.

1529
01:43:34,138 --> 01:43:35,662
Charley?

1530
01:43:37,741 --> 01:43:39,504
Who is it?

1531
01:43:48,352 --> 01:43:49,683
Mrs. Bauford?

1532
01:43:49,753 --> 01:43:51,186
My name is Jan Steiger.

1533
01:43:51,255 --> 01:43:52,722
I'm a friend of Nick's.

1534
01:43:52,790 --> 01:43:55,190
May l?

1535
01:43:58,262 --> 01:43:59,729
We work together.

1536
01:43:59,797 --> 01:44:01,560
On and off.

1537
01:44:03,834 --> 01:44:05,893
You should move your bed.

1538
01:44:06,036 --> 01:44:07,526
It's too near the window.

1539
01:44:07,605 --> 01:44:09,869
Were you working together here?

1540
01:44:09,940 --> 01:44:12,738
Yes, in a manner of speaking.

1541
01:44:12,810 --> 01:44:14,072
How'd you know where I was?

1542
01:44:14,144 --> 01:44:15,509
My sister?

1543
01:44:15,579 --> 01:44:18,343
Oh, no, I'm not a journalist,
Mrs. Bauford.

1544
01:44:18,415 --> 01:44:20,007
I'm more import/export.

1545
01:44:20,084 --> 01:44:23,417
Cambodia, we nearly met.

1546
01:44:24,822 --> 01:44:25,846
Actually,

1547
01:44:25,923 --> 01:44:27,857
Nick mentioned you a few times.

1548
01:44:27,925 --> 01:44:29,722
I most certainly would have.

1549
01:44:29,793 --> 01:44:31,090
What do you want?

1550
01:44:31,161 --> 01:44:33,652
What do you want, Mrs. Bauford?

1551
01:44:33,731 --> 01:44:35,096
I want to know where Nick is.

1552
01:44:35,165 --> 01:44:37,065
Last I heard,

1553
01:44:37,134 --> 01:44:38,795
he was being held
in the mountains--

1554
01:44:38,869 --> 01:44:40,063
a rebel position,

1555
01:44:40,137 --> 01:44:41,900
about five, six miles
northeast of here.

1556
01:44:41,972 --> 01:44:44,031
Whole area's under heavy
Russian shelling now,

1557
01:44:44,108 --> 01:44:45,939
but I managed
to make radio contact.

1558
01:44:46,043 --> 01:44:48,534
They were negotiating,
they knew who he was.

1559
01:44:50,881 --> 01:44:53,850
But that was yesterday,
been nothing since.

1560
01:44:53,917 --> 01:44:57,080
Chances are that he's dead.

1561
01:44:59,223 --> 01:45:00,622
So why are you telling me this?

1562
01:45:00,691 --> 01:45:03,159
I'm curious.

1563
01:45:03,227 --> 01:45:06,162
I mean, you come
to this shit-hole in hell,

1564
01:45:06,230 --> 01:45:09,597
and you think you can find him?

1565
01:45:09,667 --> 01:45:11,658
What is it?

1566
01:45:11,735 --> 01:45:13,168
Is this... love?

1567
01:45:13,237 --> 01:45:14,602
Is that what it is?

1568
01:45:18,475 --> 01:45:19,772
Okay, whatever.

1569
01:45:19,843 --> 01:45:22,004
You're here.

1570
01:45:22,079 --> 01:45:23,546
Now...

1571
01:45:23,614 --> 01:45:25,582
if I get him back alive.

1572
01:45:25,649 --> 01:45:28,083
I'll lose one less operative.

1573
01:45:28,152 --> 01:45:31,451
If he's dead, he's dead.

1574
01:45:31,522 --> 01:45:34,889
Of course I'm not stupid enough
to risk my own ass

1575
01:45:34,958 --> 01:45:36,926
for some fucked-up big mouth.

1576
01:45:37,027 --> 01:45:41,862
But you, you're willing
to risk your life for love.

1577
01:45:44,835 --> 01:45:47,360
I'll trade with anything,
Mrs. Bauford.

1578
01:45:47,438 --> 01:45:49,303
Anything at all.

1579
01:45:52,242 --> 01:45:53,300
Fine.

1580
01:45:53,377 --> 01:45:56,904
What do I do?

1581
01:45:56,980 --> 01:45:59,471
I have a friend, a local.

1582
01:45:59,550 --> 01:46:02,280
He can get you
into the mountains,

1583
01:46:02,353 --> 01:46:05,481
but after that,
I'm just a spectator.

1584
01:46:09,159 --> 01:46:11,024
Love.

1585
01:47:31,041 --> 01:47:32,736
I'm looking for Nick Callahan,

1586
01:47:32,810 --> 01:47:35,210
the English doctor.

1587
01:48:11,081 --> 01:48:12,514
Come.

1588
01:48:15,752 --> 01:48:17,686
Five minutes.

1589
01:48:39,176 --> 01:48:40,609
Nick?

1590
01:48:43,080 --> 01:48:44,240
Nick, it's Sarah.

1591
01:48:56,627 --> 01:48:57,924
I'm going to get you
out of here.

1592
01:48:57,995 --> 01:48:59,622
We're going to get
out of here right now.

1593
01:49:02,733 --> 01:49:04,724
There's a Red Cross camp
on the border.

1594
01:49:04,801 --> 01:49:06,166
It's about
four miles west of here.

1595
01:49:06,236 --> 01:49:07,203
We can walk it.

1596
01:49:08,238 --> 01:49:09,398
Damn it!

1597
01:49:09,473 --> 01:49:11,031
Come on, get up.
Get up!

1598
01:49:11,108 --> 01:49:12,336
Nick, get up!

1599
01:49:43,974 --> 01:49:48,308
Nick? Remember?

1600
01:49:48,378 --> 01:49:50,278
Remember I wrote to you?

1601
01:49:50,347 --> 01:49:52,338
And I told you

1602
01:49:52,416 --> 01:49:54,611
you have a daughter.

1603
01:49:54,685 --> 01:49:58,917
Anna.
You remember?

1604
01:49:58,989 --> 01:50:01,753
You're a dad.

1605
01:50:01,825 --> 01:50:05,727
And she needs you.

1606
01:50:05,796 --> 01:50:11,462
She needs you to get up
and walk out of here.

1607
01:50:11,535 --> 01:50:13,298
So get up.

1608
01:50:13,370 --> 01:50:15,201
Get up, Nick.

1609
01:50:44,735 --> 01:50:46,430
That was close.

1610
01:51:25,442 --> 01:51:27,069
What?

1611
01:51:27,144 --> 01:51:29,044
We need a lot
of money to do...

1612
01:51:29,112 --> 01:51:31,444
It won't be hard to track us.

1613
01:53:25,362 --> 01:53:26,920
-I can't make it-- go!
-You can...

1614
01:53:26,997 --> 01:53:28,692
Go, you've got to go.
Listen to me.

1615
01:53:28,765 --> 01:53:30,062
Listen to me.
Listen to me.

1616
01:53:30,133 --> 01:53:31,259
They're not going to kill me.

1617
01:53:31,334 --> 01:53:33,325
They're not going to kill me.
They need me alive.

1618
01:53:33,403 --> 01:53:34,370
I'm worth money to them.

1619
01:53:34,437 --> 01:53:36,268
If they get you,

1620
01:53:36,339 --> 01:53:38,136
they will rape you,
they will kill you.

1621
01:53:38,208 --> 01:53:40,403
Y-You've got to go
and get help.

1622
01:53:43,580 --> 01:53:45,810
Okay. Okay.

1623
01:54:46,076 --> 01:54:47,873
Sarah!

1624
01:54:50,080 --> 01:54:53,208
Sarah, go!

1625
01:54:53,283 --> 01:54:55,342
Go! You can make it.

1626
01:54:57,687 --> 01:54:59,848
Go!

1627
01:54:59,923 --> 01:55:01,447
What are you...

1628
01:55:01,524 --> 01:55:03,321
What are you doing?!

1629
01:55:03,393 --> 01:55:05,020
For God's...

1630
01:55:05,095 --> 01:55:08,895
Sarah, please!

1631
01:55:08,999 --> 01:55:10,489
Stay. Stay.

1632
01:55:10,567 --> 01:55:12,762
Go!

1633
01:56:16,533 --> 01:56:19,866
I hope when
you're reading this letter,

1634
01:56:19,936 --> 01:56:22,769
that I'm sitting there
next to you

1635
01:56:22,839 --> 01:56:25,899
and you're telling me
that I'm stupid for writing it,

1636
01:56:26,042 --> 01:56:29,102
and crazy
for trying to find you.

1637
01:56:29,179 --> 01:56:31,909
But how could I not?

1638
01:56:32,048 --> 01:56:34,141
It's you.

1639
01:56:34,217 --> 01:56:38,745
All this time,
so many years apart...

1640
01:56:38,822 --> 01:56:41,757
I've missed you,

1641
01:56:41,825 --> 01:56:45,852
but I have never been
without you.

1642
01:56:45,929 --> 01:56:49,797
I've woken up with you
every morning

1643
01:56:49,866 --> 01:56:52,460
and gone to sleep with you
every night.

1644
01:56:52,535 --> 01:56:55,231
You have always been with me.

1645
01:56:55,305 --> 01:56:58,706
Your courage, your smile...

1646
01:56:58,775 --> 01:57:01,744
your damn stubbornness.

1647
01:57:01,811 --> 01:57:05,804
There has never been
any distance between us,

1648
01:57:05,882 --> 01:57:08,749
and there never will be.

1649
01:57:10,587 --> 01:57:12,555
I love you, Nick.

1650
01:57:12,622 --> 01:57:15,216
I love you.

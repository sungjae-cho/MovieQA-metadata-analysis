You point them in the right direction
and shit gets real.

175
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:35,700
Hi.
- Hi.

176
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:40,100
Hi. Um, I just wanted to meet you...

177
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,800
..or something?
I'm Jennifer Check.

178
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:44,000
And..this is my friend.

179
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:44,900
Hi.

180
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,300
I'm Nikolai, and this is...

181
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,800
..this is my band.

182
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:50,600
Low Shoulder.

183
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,500
Yeah, we heard..I heard of that band...

184
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,700
You play instruments really...

185
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,300
..super good.

186
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:59,100
Thank you, we're professionals.

187
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:00,700
Hey, sorry...

188
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,700
Can I ask you a question?

189
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:06,000
Why would you want to play all the way out
here in the Devil's Kettle?

190
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:07,100
You live in city, right?

191
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,500
Yeah. But, you know what...

192
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:11,800
I think it's really important sometimes to try
and connect with our fans in their...

193
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:13,800
..shitty areas too.

194
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,800
That's amazing.

195
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:21,600
Can I-Can I buy you a drink?
- Sure, what are we having?

196
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:24,500
They have this really awesome
9/11 tribute shooter?

197
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,500
It's red, white and blue,
but you have to drink it really fast...

198
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,800
..or it turns brownish.
- Alright, I'll drink it fast.

199
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:30,400
Okay.
- Okay.

200
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,400
I'll be right back.

201
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,800
Okay! How-how you're gonna get alcohol?

202
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,400
I'll just play hello titty with the bartender.

203
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,300
Dirk, what about her?

204
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,800
Who, Jan Brady?

205
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,400
No, man! Fuck you!

206
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:55,000
I'm talking about the one who just went
to get me a drink...

207
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:57,600
..butter-face princess.
That's the one.

208
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:00,200
I don't know! Seriously,
I grew up in a town like this, okay...

209
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:04,300
..there's always that girl, if they show it off,
they do not give it up.

210
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:05,900
You told us, you were from Brooklyn.

211
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,800
My point is, this girl's definitely a virgin.
Okay?

212
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:12,600
Now, I know girls like that...
- I don't know.

213
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:15,100
Well, you know, we didn't turn all the
way out here for nothing.

214
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,700
So...
- Excuse me.

215
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:18,100
Hey!
- Hey!

216
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:20,600
That's my best friend you're talking about.

217
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:23,500
And you're right, she is a virgin,

218
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,500
And not be sleeping with creeps like you.

219
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:40,800
The second one isn't full enough.

220
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:43,400
Those guys are rank, Jen.
Just forget about it.

221
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,900
You know what?
I think the lead singer likes me.

222
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:48,300
Only because he thinks you're a virgin.
I heard them talking.

223
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:48,900
What?

224
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,200
I'm not even a backdoor-virgin anymore,
thanks to Roman.

225
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,600
And by the way, that hurts.

226
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,600
I couldn't even go to flags the next day.

227
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:00,400
I had to stay home and sit on a
bag of frozen peas.

228
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,400
Oh, God!

229
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:07,400
Good evening, Devil's Lake.
- Devil's Kettle.

230
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:09,300
You're absolutely right at it.

231
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:12,700
<b>"Through the Trees"
performed by Low Shoulder</b>

232
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:30,400
<i>All alone in an empty room,</i>

233
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:35,300
<i>Nothing left but the memories of when...</i>

234
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,500
<i>..I had my best friend.</i>

235
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:41,100
<i>I don't know how we ended up here,</i>

236
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,900
<i>I don't know but it's never been so clear,</i>

237
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:50,200
<i>We made a mistake, dear.</i>

238
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:53,800
<i>And I see...</i>

239
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:58,300
<i>..the broken glass in front of me.</i>

240
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,800
<i>I see...</i>

241
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:05,000
<i>..your shadow hanging over me.</i>

242
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:09,000
<i>And your face, I can see...</i>

243
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:12,400
<i>Through the trees,</i>

244
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:15,900
<i>I will find you.</i>

245
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:23,200
<i>I will heal the ruins left inside you,</i>

246
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:26,800
<i>Because I'm still here breathing now.</i>

247
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,800
<i>I'm still here breathing now.</i>

248
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:33,700
<i>I'm still here breathing now.</i>

249
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,900
<i>Until I'm set free.</i>

250
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:40,200
<i>Go quiet through the trees.</i>

251
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:45,600
<i>I remember how we used to talk,</i>

252
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:48,800
<i>About the places we would go when...</i>

253
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,500
<i>..we were off.</i>

254
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:53,200
<i>And all that we were gonna find.</i>

255
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:59,700
<i>And I remember our seeds grow,</i>

256
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:02,400
<i>And how you cried when you saw...</i>

257
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:04,500
<i>..the first leaves show.</i>

258
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,200
Hey, get out of there.

259
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,500
I know where to go.

260
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:52,300
It's okay, okay, Jen.

261
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:02,700
Jennifer?
- Oh, thank God, you guys are alright.

262
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,900
I have been looking everwhere for you two.

263
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:08,300
This sucks!
It's too dangerous out here.

264
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:10,400
You want to head somewhere safer,
like my van?

265
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,100
What?

266
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,600
I'm in survival mode, right now.
I want us to get to a familiar place...

267
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:17,800
..and right now, I feel like that's my van.

268
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:18,800
Okay...

269
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Okay, this will help with the shock.
Great.

270
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,500
Are you shocked?
Have some of that.

271
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,200
No.

272
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,100
Jennifer?

273
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,000
Hey!

274
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:35,400
Let's go, Jennifer.

275
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,900
Let's go to the van.
- I want to go to your really cool van.

276
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:41,100
Needy, let's go see his van.
- Why? Why should we?

277
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:43,000
We have the Sebring,
let's just get out of here, please.

278
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:44,600
Needy, just stop it.

279
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,800
Just shut up!

280
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:06,300
<i>I watched her get into that van and I knew
something awful was going to happen.</i>

281
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:08,300
<i>He was skinny and twisted
and evil...</i>

282
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:12,000
<i>..like this petrified tree I saw
when I was kid.</i>

283
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:07,200
Hey, Niedermeyer.
- Thank God, you're there.

284
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,400
What wrong?
- Jennifer's gone.

285
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:14,100
She ran off with that rock band.
And Melody Lane burned down.

286
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,300
You're okay, right?
- Yeah.

287
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:19,200
There was this huge stampede and...

288
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:21,300
All the people who fainted got run over.

289
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:24,800
And you could hear their bones breaking.

290
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:26,300
And the people...

291
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:30,000
Like..the people on fire just smelled like...

292
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
This is crazy.
- But Jennifer's still with those creeps.

293
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,400
They took her in their spooky van with
the windows all blacked out.

294
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:39,700
Did you get the make and model?
- I don't know, Chip. An '89 Rapist.

295
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:42,000
She's still in there.
We have to go find her.

296
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Who cares about Jennifer and
those douchebags...

297
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:45,700
..with their douchebag haircuts and
their manskirts.

298
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:47,700
People just burned to death.

299
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:51,200
Oh, cheese and fries!
There's somebody here.

300
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:54,600
I'm alone and I'm freaked out.
- Where's your mom?

301
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,200
Swing shift.

302
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,900
Stay on the phone with me, okay?

303
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:07,500
Needy, you want me to come over?
- I don't know.

304
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:09,300
Maybe.

305
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:21,800
Needy?

306
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,600
Chip, there's no one here.

307
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,800
So strange.

308
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,400
Maybe I'm going crazy.

309
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,500
Probably nothing.

310
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:42,100
Look, I'll call you later.
- Okay.

311
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,100
Hi.

312
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,300
What happened?

313
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,800
Jen?

314
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,100
Jen?

315
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:50,700
My mom got that at Boston market and...

316
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,400
Um, it's on your lips...

317
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:25,600
Jennifer...

318
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,800
Jennifer?

319
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:55,500
Are you scared?

320
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,200
Jennifer!

321
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:30,100
There's a body in here.

322
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:39,600
I heard Needy and Jennifer were there.

323
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:42,600
And they had to fight their way out
with a machete.

324
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,800
Look, she's not even mÿving.

325
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:47,300
It's called post-traumatic stress disorder.

326
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:50,200
My Dad was in operation during freedom...

327
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:53,900
..and he totally like, stopped talking,
like months.

328
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:01,200
I'll be Perfect Prom Barbie,
and you be her.

329
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:04,000
Why I should be ugly Ashley?

330
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,700
What wrong, Jennifer?

331
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:17,400
Don't tell my mom about this.
She'll make me get a shot.

332
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:19,300
I never tell on you.

333
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:24,400
Where's it at, Monistat?

334
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:29,500
You're alright.
- Yeah, why wouldn't I be?

335
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:33,600
I saw last night in my house...
- You do have a tendency to overeact.

336
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,300
You remember, when we were
in Girl Scout camp...

337
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:37,000
..and you totally thought there was
an earthquake...

338
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:39,800
..but it was just two guys with
a ghetto blaster?

339
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:45,200
People died, Jennifer.
It's like all over the news.

340
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,300
National news.

341
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:49,800
Anybody that we know?

342
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:52,200
We know everyone!

343
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:55,300
Sucks to be them, I guess.

344
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:00,700
What is wrong with you?
- What's wrong with you?

345
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:03,600
Besides the obvious surface flaws.

346
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:07,100

..dark day for Devil's Kettle.

355

Spanish teacher,

Kind of weird.

I mean, she looked like, she'd been
beaten up or shot or something.

376
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:20,000
And then she barfed up this like disgusting...

377

..prickly stuff that looked like a roadkill...

378

- Yuck.

379
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:29,900
She'd probably just inhaled a whole bunch
of smoke or something.

380
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:32,100
No, Chip! No, it was like...

381
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:33,800
It was like evil!

382

talk to the school shrink.

It's just...

..everybody's a little messed up about this.
And it's okay to feel...

387

Discombobulated?
- Yeah! Fucked up!

I just am.

397

We have composition together.
He's a really good writer.

398

He's like all dark and emotional

She's just staring out the front window like
a zombie mannequin robot statue.

520
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:58,100
This can't be a coincidence.

521
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,800
What you talking about, Needy?
- A fiery death trap last night,

522
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:04,500
And now a cannibal psycho takes down
the biggest guy in school, come on.

523
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,400
It's freaktarded.

524
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:10,000
Well, the bad luck's gotta be over, right?

525
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:13,100
I mean, it can't get any worse, right?
It can't.

526
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,700
I mean, you agree, right?

527
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:16,800
You're shaking.

528
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,000
I'm cold.

529
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,300
It's very cold out here.
- You want my hoodie?

532
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:28,800
The days marched on as usual,

533
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:31,800
..but most of us were too numb
to enjoy ourselves.

534
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,600
Most of us.

535
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:37,000
<i>I don't know how we ended up here.</i>

536
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:41,600
<i>I don't know but it's never been so clear.</i>

537
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:45,800
<i>We made a mistake, dear.</i>

538
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:49,800
<i>To the rest of the world we were famous.
We were saints.</i>

539
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,800
<i>Our town's only bar had burned to the ground.</i>

540
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:55,100
<i>And our star line-backer was
someone's snack pack.</i>

541
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:58,900
<i>The whole country got a huge tragedy boner
for Devil's Kettle.</i>

542
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,200

543
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:03,400
<i>They couldn't get enough of our little
world of shit.</i>

544

545
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:11,500
<i>I will find you.</i>

546
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:18,700
<i>I will heal the ruins left inside you.</i>

547
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:22,200
<i>Because I'm still here breathing now.</i>

548
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:25,400

00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:29,100

551
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:35,600
<i>Go quiet through the trees.</i>

552
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:37,900
<i>Still, we were healing.</i>

553
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:41,500
<i>Like Chip, we figured things could
only get better.</i>

554
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
<i>We had faith.</i>

555
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
<i>We were fucking idiots.</i>

556
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:52,300
Before the period ends, I would like to
make an announcement.

557
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:56,300
As you all know, today is the
one month anniversary of...

558
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:58,400
..the tragedy at Melody Lane,

559
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:01,100
..and the murder of Jonas Kozelle.

560
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:03,100
Boring.

561
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:06,200
As I was saying, Jennifer...

562
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:07,400
..and Needy.

563
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:10,000
I finally got some good news to
share with all of you.

564
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:13,000
The members of the rock n' roll group
Low Shoulder,

565
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:17,000
..have decided to extend a helping hand
to our community.

566
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
As you all know, their song...

567
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,500
'Through the trees'

568
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:25,500
..has become our unofficial anthem
of unity and healing.

569
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:28,700
And they have decided to release it
as a benefit single.

570
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:33,300
3% of the profits will go to local families
who have been affected by loss.

571
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:36,000
What about the other 97%?

572
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,800
I mean, that's just crass. Right?

573
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:41,400
Crass.

574
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:44,600
It means greedy. Exploitative.
Scummy.

575
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:47,600
Low Shoulder are American heroes.
- No, they're not.

576
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:49,600
I was there, Chastity.

577
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:52,300
They didn't helped anybody escape the fire.

578
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:54,000
I don't even know how that
rumor all got started.

579
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,300
Rumor?

580
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:56,400
Rumor?

581
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:57,900
It's true!

582
00:40:57,900 --> 00:40:59,900
It's on the Wikipedia.

583
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:04,000
We wouldn't even know who they were
if they hadn't been playing that night.

584
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:06,600
They used by us.
- You take that back, Needy Lesnicki!

585
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:07,300
Girls?

586
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:09,000
We need them now more than ever.

587
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,600
That's enough.

588
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:18,500
I'm already sick of that song.
- Yeah, it's really poorly produced.

589
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:21,700
Could the bass be any lower in the mix?
- No offense,

590
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,800
..but you really look tired.

591
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:25,800
Is everything, okay?
- No.

592
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:27,400
I feel like boo-bbo.

593
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:32,400
My skin is breaking out and
my hair is dull and lifeless.

594
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:33,300
Oh, God.

595
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:35,800
It's like I'm one of the normal girls!

596
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:37,900
Are you PMS-ing or something?

597
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:39,300
PMS isn't real, Needy.

598
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:42,700
It was invented by the boy-run media
to make us seem crazy.

599
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:46,700
Don't look at me like that.

600
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:51,500
It's just wearing off or something.
- What's wearing off?

601
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,100
Hello, Needy.

602
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:56,900
Hi.

603
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,200
Jennifer.

604
00:41:58,300 --> 00:41:59,500
Hey, Collin.

605
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:01,600
Can I borrow your English homework again?

606
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:03,100
I forgot to read Hamlet.

607
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:05,200
Is he gonna fuck his mom?

608
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:09,100
I don't..I don't...
I don't think so.

609
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:11,500
I sort of wanted to ask you something.

610
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:13,800
You want to know if I'll go out with you?
- No.

611
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:16,000
Yeah! What?

612
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:20,100
How-How did you know?
- Just go ahead with the pitch.

613
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,600
Okay.

614
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:28,100
Well, we have been having a lot fun
in the class, you and I,

615
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,100
..and I thought maybe you would like to go,
see a movie...

616
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:31,800
..or something.

617
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:36,500
There's a midnight showing of Rocky Horror
at the Bijou, next weekend.

618
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:38,900
I don't like boxing movies.

619
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:42,400
Yeah, but..
It's not a...

620
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:45,400
Fucking boxing movie.

621
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:48,300
Fuck it, okay.
Forget it.

622
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:51,500
That was random.

623
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:54,200
I'm used to boys asking me out, Needy.

624
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:57,100
Collin's really nice.

625
00:42:57,600 --> 00:43:00,100
He's into maggot-rock.
He wears nail polish.

626
00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:03,300
My dick is bigger than his.
- Well, I think he is really cool.

627
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:05,900
You do?
- Yeah.

628
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:10,100
Wait! Collin?

629
00:43:12,100 --> 00:43:14,400
Why don't you just come by
my place tonight?

630
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:18,500
I just got Aquamarine on DVD.
It's about this girl who like, half-sushi.

631
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:21,300
I guess she has sex through her blowhole
or something.

632
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:24,800
Okay.

633
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:27,700
Great! Yeah.

634
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:30,500
Okay, I'll text you my address.

635
00:43:31,300 --> 00:43:32,900
Cool.

636
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
Hi.
- Hi.

637
00:43:40,900 --> 00:43:42,600
Hi, Chip.

638
00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:46,700
Get a room.

639
00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:50,600
So talking to your mysterious pal
Collin Gray, again?

640
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:51,400
No.

641
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:55,100
He was asking Jennifer out on a date.
- That's weird.

642
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:57,400
So, you're gonna come over tonight?

643
00:43:57,700 --> 00:43:59,000
Sure. I'd like that.

644
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,900
I went to Super Target and
picked up more condoms. So,

645
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:04,100
Thanks.
- Not that that has anything to do with...

646
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,500
Oh, no. I didn't assume that.

647
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:06,800
Well, I'm...

648
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:09,700
Okay, I'll see you tonight then.

649
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:12,100

if you..?

653
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:28,700

00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:49,600
<i>I wanna...</i>

691
00:48:53,700 --> 00:48:59,100
<i>I wanna love you, love you,
you already know.</i>

692
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:05,100
You made it.

693
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:10,500
What's going on?

694
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
This...

695
00:49:18,900 --> 00:49:21,800
This isn't really your house, is it?

696
00:49:22,100 --> 00:49:24,100
No, baby.

697
00:49:24,100 --> 00:49:25,900
This is our house.

698
00:49:25,900 --> 00:49:27,900
Just for you and me.

699
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:31,300
We can play Mommy and Daddy.

700
00:49:39,500 --> 00:49:42,000
Do you even know my last name?

701
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,700
Silly.

702
00:49:45,100 --> 00:49:47,500
I've been sending you signals all year.

703
00:49:48,300 --> 00:49:50,300
Couldn't you tell?

704
00:49:50,600 --> 00:49:53,200
You give me such a wettie.

705
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:12,000
Put it in.

706
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:34,300
Jennifer!

707
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:36,900
What?

708
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:37,900
Are you scared?

709
00:50:37,900 --> 00:50:41,300
I mean, I thought boys like yÿu were
really into..vermin.

710
00:50:41,300 --> 00:50:42,900
Death and shit.

711
00:50:43,900 --> 00:50:45,600
Here you go.

712
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:50,400
Nice hardware, ace.

713
00:51:14,700 --> 00:51:16,700
No way...

714
00:51:22,700 --> 00:51:24,000
Shit!

715
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:24,900
Oh, puncture wound!

716
00:51:24,900 --> 00:51:27,900
God, that's so emo.

717
00:51:31,900 --> 00:51:33,900
I need you frightened.

718
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,500
I need you hopeless.

719
00:52:12,300 --> 00:52:14,000
Hopeless!

720
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:36,200
What?

721
00:52:37,500 --> 00:52:39,200
What?

722
00:52:39,700 --> 00:52:41,700
Am I hurting you?

723
00:52:44,100 --> 00:52:46,100
Am I too big?

724
00:52:49,900 --> 00:52:51,900
What?

725
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:57,500
Needy! What's wrong?

726
00:52:57,600 --> 00:52:59,900
Is it something I did?

727
00:54:43,500 --> 00:54:45,800
Mommy! Mommy?

728
00:55:11,500 --> 00:55:13,500
Are you scared?

729
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,300
Hi.

730
00:55:52,300 --> 00:55:54,600
Hi, Needy!
Enough with this screaming.

731
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:56,700
You're such a cliche.
- Get out!

732
00:55:58,200 --> 00:56:01,600
But we always share your bed when
we have slumber parties.

733
00:56:06,700 --> 00:56:09,700
I'm not gonna bite you.

734
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:20,200
How may you own that T-shirt?

735
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:27,300
What the fuck is happening?
- My God, Needy!

736
00:57:27,300 --> 00:57:30,100
I have never heard you drop
the F-bomb before.

737
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:33,400
You! I saw you! I saw you!
- Buh-buh-buh.

738
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:36,100
Slow down, tardy slip.
You sound like a sped.

739
00:57:36,200 --> 00:57:37,800
I'm gonna call the police.

740
00:57:37,900 --> 00:57:40,400
Oh, okay! Why don't you narc me out.

741
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:43,000
I've the cops in my back pocket, Needy.

742
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:45,600
I'm fucking a cadet, remember?

743
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
What you want from me?

744
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,800
Just only explain some things to you.

745
00:57:51,100 --> 00:57:55,200
Besides, best friends don't keep secrets.
Right?

746
00:57:57,100 --> 00:57:59,100
Incase, you remember the night of the fire?

747
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,000
I got really messed up.

748
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,000
And those guys from Low Shoulder.

749
00:58:02,900 --> 00:58:04,500
Totally evil.

750
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:09,400
They are basically like agents of Satan
with really awesome haircuts.

751
00:58:11,300 --> 00:58:13,300
<b>"Finishing School"
performed by Dashboard Confessional</b>

752
00:58:17,700 --> 00:58:19,400
Where-Where are we going?

753
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:21,800
You don't have to talk,
if you don't want it.

754
00:58:30,900 --> 00:58:32,900
Are you guys rapists?

755
00:58:33,400 --> 00:58:35,400
Oh, God! I hate girls.

756
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:42,900
Are you even sure she's
fucking virgin, man?

757
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:45,800
Yes!
Yes, I'm a virgin!

758
00:58:45,700 --> 00:58:49,400
I'm virign! I never-never even done sex.
I don't know how.

759
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:53,500
So..you guys find somebody who does.

760
00:58:53,700 --> 00:58:55,000
Know how.

761
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:55,800
See, Dirk?

762
00:58:55,800 --> 00:58:58,000
I told you, man.
You owe me a beer.

763
00:58:58,600 --> 00:58:59,700
What did they do to you?

764
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:01,400
Just let me finish.

765
00:59:01,900 --> 00:59:03,500
So they drove me out to the falls.

766
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:06,800
And I kept looking for a way to escape but...

767
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:09,300
..it's really dark out there.

768
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:19,300
Where are you going, huh?

769
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:21,900
We got a waxing moon tonight, you guys.

770
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
Just like the ritual said.

771
00:59:34,800 --> 00:59:38,100
Why don't you guys have something to
shut up her up with?

772
00:59:41,300 --> 00:59:42,900
Dirk, get a knife and tie it well.

773
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:44,700
Because I don't want it to get uncord.

774
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:56,800
I don't know if we should go
through with this.

775
00:59:58,300 --> 00:59:59,900
Dirk.

776
01:00:00,100 --> 01:00:03,000
You wanna work in musical copy forever?
I don't.

777
01:00:03,100 --> 01:00:03,900
Okay?

778
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,200
You wanna be a big loser or...

779
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:08,200
..do you wanna be rich...

780
01:00:08,100 --> 01:00:11,500
..and awesome like that guy from Maroon 5?

781
01:00:13,500 --> 01:00:15,200
Maroon 5.

782
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:17,400
Okay, so I thought.

783
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:19,400
Go and fetch me the ritual, brother.

784
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:28,500
Thank you.

785
01:00:29,600 --> 01:00:30,500
Alright.

786
01:00:30,600 --> 01:00:33,900
That's it?
- Yeah, I found it online.

787
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:39,000
We come here tonight to
sacrifice the body of...

788
01:00:41,300 --> 01:00:42,900
What's your name again?
Tiffany?

789
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:44,900
My name is Jennifer.

790
01:00:44,900 --> 01:00:45,700
Super.

791
01:00:45,700 --> 01:00:46,800
We come here tonight...

792
01:00:46,800 --> 01:00:49,900
..to sacrifice the body of Jennifer
from Devil's Kettle.

793
01:00:49,900 --> 01:00:51,500
Please, please...

794
01:00:51,600 --> 01:00:55,700
Please let me go. I'll do anything.
I'll do any fucking...

795
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:05,400
Do you know how hard it is to make it
as an indie band these days?

796
01:01:05,300 --> 01:01:06,900
There's so many of us,

797
01:01:07,100 --> 01:01:11,100
We're all so cute and it's like if you don't
get on Letterman..

798
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:14,800
..or some retarded soundtrack,
you're screwed, okay?

799
01:01:14,800 --> 01:01:16,500
Satan is our only chance.

800
01:01:16,900 --> 01:01:18,200
We're in league with the beast now.

801
01:01:18,300 --> 01:01:20,400
And we have to make a really
big impression on it.

802
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:23,300
And to do that, we're going to
have to butcher you.

803
01:01:23,300 --> 01:01:24,500
And bleed you.

804
01:01:24,700 --> 01:01:26,300
And Dirk here is gonna wear your face.

805
01:01:26,300 --> 01:01:28,100
Relax, I'm kidding about the face.

806
01:01:28,300 --> 01:01:30,300
The rest is gonna happen though.

807
01:01:33,300 --> 01:01:34,900
You know what?
May be we'll write a song about you.

808
01:01:34,900 --> 01:01:37,300
I think as a fan that would be
pretty cool, right?

809
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
With the deepest malice,

810
01:01:48,300 --> 01:01:51,100
We deliver this virgin unto thee.

811
01:01:51,100 --> 01:01:52,700
Dude, that is a hot murder weapon.

812
01:01:52,700 --> 01:01:54,000
It's a bowie knife.

813
01:01:54,100 --> 01:01:55,300
Bowie? Nice.

814
01:01:55,300 --> 01:01:57,300
Alright, here we go!
It's gonna be alright.

815
01:01:57,300 --> 01:02:00,100
Help me please..please..
Help me...

816
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,100
Wait a sec!
I just thought of something.

817
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:04,000
Jen.

818
01:02:04,300 --> 01:02:05,500
Jen, you're the girl for me.

819
01:02:05,500 --> 01:02:07,800
You don't know me.
But you make me so happy.

820
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:10,700
I tried to call you before,
but I lost my nerve.

821
01:02:10,800 --> 01:02:13,500
I used my imagination.

822
01:02:13,600 --> 01:02:16,200
But I was disturbed.

823
01:02:16,600 --> 01:02:19,700
Jenny, I got your number.

824
01:02:19,700 --> 01:02:22,700
I need to make you mine.

825
01:02:22,800 --> 01:02:26,000
Jenny, donít change your number,

826
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:29,200
..8-6-7-5-3-0-9....

827
01:02:29,100 --> 01:02:32,100
..8-6-7-5-3-0-9....

828
01:02:33,400 --> 01:02:36,800
..8-6-7-5-3-0-9....

829
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
They killed you.
- Oops!

830
01:02:46,100 --> 01:02:47,800
I'm still here, aren't I?

831
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,800
I mean, they did go Benihana
on my ass with that knife.

832
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:52,700
And it should have killed me but...

833
01:02:52,800 --> 01:02:54,600
..for some reason...

834
01:02:54,800 --> 01:02:56,400
..it didn't.

835
01:02:58,300 --> 01:03:00,000
Maybe it did.

836
01:03:25,900 --> 01:03:28,500
Anyway, I don't really remember
what happened after that.

837
01:03:28,500 --> 01:03:31,200
I just know that I woke up and...

838
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:33,600
..I found my way back to you.

839
01:03:45,300 --> 01:03:47,000
I remember.

840
01:03:47,900 --> 01:03:50,200
I couldn't bring myself to hurt you.

841
01:03:50,300 --> 01:03:52,700
I mean, I'm a really good friend.

842
01:03:53,300 --> 01:03:56,200
I was just so hungry.

843
01:04:14,700 --> 01:04:16,300
Ahmet!

844
01:04:17,700 --> 01:04:19,400
You made it out?

845
01:04:23,300 --> 01:04:25,000
Are you lost?

846
01:04:27,700 --> 01:04:30,400
Does your host family know that
you're alive?

847
01:04:33,700 --> 01:04:36,100
Does anyone know you're alive?

848
01:04:41,700 --> 01:04:43,500
You come with me.

849
01:04:43,800 --> 01:04:45,500
We will sort this out.

850
01:04:47,300 --> 01:04:51,400
And ever since then, I just knew what
I have to do to be strong.

851
01:04:51,400 --> 01:04:55,200
And when I'm full, like I'm right now.
I'm like...

852
01:04:55,500 --> 01:04:56,900
..unkillable.

853
01:04:57,100 --> 01:04:59,100
Like I can do shit like this.
Watch!

854
01:05:01,800 --> 01:05:03,900
It's really cool.
Just relax. Look.

855
01:05:07,500 --> 01:05:09,600
It's like some X-Men shit, right?

856
01:05:15,800 --> 01:05:19,000
What do you mean, when you're full?

857
01:05:22,100 --> 01:05:24,400
What about my mom's Kia?

858
01:05:24,600 --> 01:05:26,900
Why were you covered in blood?

859
01:05:26,900 --> 01:05:29,300
You didn't even look human.

860
01:05:31,900 --> 01:05:35,300
You know, Needy, maybe you should
talk to somebody about these...

861
01:05:35,300 --> 01:05:37,400
..disturbing thoughts.

862
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:41,200
..that you're having.
We're all really concerned.

863
01:05:42,100 --> 01:05:44,100
Especially, Chip.

864
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:47,000
I think he may be having
second thoughts about you.

865
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:48,000
Leave!

866
01:05:48,100 --> 01:05:50,300
Come on, Needy.
Let me stay the night.

867
01:05:50,500 --> 01:05:53,900
We can play 'boyfriend/girlfriend'
like we used to.

868
01:06:08,100 --> 01:06:10,900
What are you doing?
- Um, you said to leave.

869
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:13,200
See you at school.

870
01:06:37,400 --> 01:06:41,900
We're gathered here to celebrate
the life of Collin Gray.

871
01:06:42,300 --> 01:06:44,700
Who was plucked from the prime
of his youth.

872
01:06:55,900 --> 01:06:59,600
<i>They did a big memorial assembly
for Collin at school.</i>

873
01:07:00,300 --> 01:07:02,600
<i>And we had to watch another
presentation about curfews...</i>

874
01:07:02,600 --> 01:07:06,000
<i>..and the buddy system and
how to deal with grief.</i>

875
01:07:06,300 --> 01:07:08,700
<i>But nobody seemed to care anymore.</i>

876
01:07:09,300 --> 01:07:11,900
<i>Sorrow was last week's emotion.</i>

877
01:07:13,800 --> 01:07:16,700
<i>Sure we all hope this would be
the last funeral.</i>

878
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:18,700
<i>But I knew better.</i>

879
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:21,400
<i>So I did some research.</i>

880
01:07:21,800 --> 01:07:23,800
<i>Paranormal research.</i>

881
01:07:36,900 --> 01:07:39,300
<b>OFFERING A VIRGIN TO SATAN.</b>

883

Destroying a demon.

884
01:07:48,100 --> 01:07:50,400
Demons are weakest when hungry.

885
01:07:50,300 --> 01:07:55,000
But a blade to the heart is the
surest way to kill the beast.

886

889
01:08:26,500 --> 01:08:28,500
I just bought our formal tickets.

890
01:08:28,500 --> 01:08:31,300
Did you make reservations at
the Cheesecake Factory?

891
01:08:32,500 --> 01:08:35,000
Chip, I can't go to the dance
with you.

892
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:36,300
What? Why?

893
01:08:36,400 --> 01:08:38,000
Look, just trust me.

894
01:08:38,200 --> 01:08:39,800
You shouldn't go at all.

895
01:08:39,800 --> 01:08:42,600
What're you talking about?
- Not here.

896
01:08:42,700 --> 01:08:44,800
What's going on?
You're breaking up with me?

897
01:08:44,900 --> 01:08:46,900
Please, Chip.
I just need to tell you something.

898
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:48,100
Is this about Jennifer?
- Yes.

899
01:08:48,200 --> 01:08:51,500
But I promise you this is the last time...
- Needy, I care about you.

900
01:08:51,400 --> 01:08:52,200
A lot.

901
01:08:52,300 --> 01:08:55,900
As a person, not just some girl
I made love to four minutes ago.

902
01:08:55,700 --> 01:08:58,000
And-And I'm scared of what's
happening to you.

903
01:08:58,100 --> 01:09:01,900
You're acting really fucked up.
- Please just let me show you.

904
01:09:04,600 --> 01:09:05,900
Okay.

905
01:09:05,900 --> 01:09:07,600
Jennifer's evil.

906
01:09:08,400 --> 01:09:09,700
I know.

907
01:09:09,900 --> 01:09:12,000
No, I mean, she's actually evil.

908
01:09:12,100 --> 01:09:13,700
Not high school evil.

909
01:09:13,700 --> 01:09:17,500
I've been through the occult section
of the library five times.

910
01:09:17,500 --> 01:09:19,500
Our library has a occult section?

911
01:09:19,500 --> 01:09:22,800
Yeah, its-its really small...

912
01:09:23,400 --> 01:09:25,100
You have to read this.

913
01:09:27,100 --> 01:09:28,800
Demon...
- Demonic transference.

914
01:09:28,800 --> 01:09:30,100
It's something that happens...

915
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,200
..when you try to sacrifice
a virgin to Satan...

916
01:09:32,200 --> 01:09:33,900
..without using an actual virgin.

917
01:09:33,900 --> 01:09:35,100
The guys from the band...

918
01:09:35,100 --> 01:09:36,700
..tried to sacrifice her in the woods.

919
01:09:36,700 --> 01:09:37,500
But what they didn't know...

920
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:39,700
..is that she hasn't been a virgin
since junior high.

921
01:09:39,700 --> 01:09:41,300
It all makes sense now.
Read this.

922
01:09:41,300 --> 01:09:43,100
If the human sacrifice is impure,

923
01:09:43,200 --> 01:09:44,300
..the result may still be obtained.

924
01:09:44,300 --> 01:09:46,600
But a demon will ever reside in the
soul of the victim.

925
01:09:46,600 --> 01:09:49,700
She must forever feed on flesh
to substain the demon.

926
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
Okay.
- She's eating boys!

927
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:53,600
They like make her really...

928
01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:54,700
..pretty and glowy...

929
01:09:54,800 --> 01:09:56,800
..and her hair looks amazing.

930
01:09:56,800 --> 01:10:00,000
And then when she's hungry,
she's weak and cranky and ugly.

931
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
I mean like ugly for her.

932
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:04,200
So, you get it?

933
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:05,500
The dance.

934
01:10:05,700 --> 01:10:09,000
It'll be like an all-you-can-eat buffet.

935
01:10:11,700 --> 01:10:13,600
Needy, I think you need help.

936
01:10:13,600 --> 01:10:15,500
Oh, my God!
You don't beleive me.

937
01:10:15,400 --> 01:10:18,700
It's not that I don't believe you,
I just don't believe this.

938
01:10:18,700 --> 01:10:21,200
God, this is a nightmare.

939
01:10:23,700 --> 01:10:25,400
And what about the dance?

940
01:10:25,400 --> 01:10:28,800
Who cares about the goddamn dance, Chip?
- I do.

941
01:10:28,900 --> 01:10:31,200
I ordered your corsage,
it's an orchid.

942
01:10:31,200 --> 01:10:33,200
It was like $12.

943
01:10:36,300 --> 01:10:37,600
I'll be at the dance.

944
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:39,600
I just need to keep an eye on Jennifer.

945
01:10:40,300 --> 01:10:42,600
Promise me, you're not gonna go.

946
01:10:45,500 --> 01:10:46,900
Needy, I...

947
01:10:46,900 --> 01:10:49,000
..I'm not your guy anymore?

948
01:10:48,900 --> 01:10:51,900

01:17:15,300 --> 01:17:17,300
Oh, you're so salty!

1041
01:17:18,100 --> 01:17:20,100
Yeah! You're...

1042
01:17:20,100 --> 01:17:21,200
..salty too.

1043
01:17:21,300 --> 01:17:23,300
Say it like you mean it.

1044
01:17:23,800 --> 01:17:27,100
Say I'm better than Needy.
- What? Why?

1045
01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:35,200
<i>Take my breath as your own.</i>

1046
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:41,800
<i>Take my eyes to guide you home.</i>

1047
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:45,600
<i>Because I'm still here breathing now.</i>

1048
01:17:45,800 --> 01:17:49,100
<i>I'm still here breathing now.</i>

1049
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:52,400
<i>I'm still here breathing now.</i>

1050
01:17:52,700 --> 01:17:55,800
<i>I'm still here...</i>

1051
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:57,000
Chip!

1052
01:17:57,100 --> 01:18:00,800
<i>Because I'm still here breathing now.</i>

1053
01:18:00,800 --> 01:18:04,300
<i>I'm still here breathing now.</i>

1054
01:18:04,200 --> 01:18:07,600
<i>I'm still here breathing now.</i>

1055
01:18:07,500 --> 01:18:11,200
<i>And I'm still here so...</i>

1056
01:18:11,100 --> 01:18:14,400
<i>Because I'm still here breathing now.</i>

1057
01:18:14,500 --> 01:18:17,900
<i>I'm still here breathing now.</i>

1058
01:18:17,800 --> 01:18:21,200
<i>I'm still here breathing now.</i>

1059
01:18:21,600 --> 01:18:24,800
<i>And I'm still here...</i>

1060
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:28,100
<i>Because you're not coming back.</i>

1061
01:18:51,600 --> 01:18:54,200
What are you doing?
- Swimming.

1062
01:18:56,400 --> 01:18:58,200
Come on, Chip.

1063
01:18:58,300 --> 01:19:00,700
Show me your breast stroke.

1064
01:19:14,600 --> 01:19:16,700
I feel so empty.

1065
01:19:21,200 --> 01:19:23,200
Yeah, me too.

1066
01:19:25,400 --> 01:19:28,300
Please just come here and kiss me again.

1067
01:19:38,300 --> 01:19:39,900
I can't.

1068
01:19:41,100 --> 01:19:42,800
I'm sorry.

1069
01:19:43,100 --> 01:19:45,100
This just feels weird.

1070
01:20:23,500 --> 01:20:25,500
Help!

1071
01:20:51,900 --> 01:20:53,600
Needy.

1072
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:23,700
Needy.

1073
01:21:47,600 --> 01:21:49,200
She can fly?

1074
01:21:49,500 --> 01:21:50,800
She's just hovering.

1075
01:21:50,900 --> 01:21:51,800
It's not that impressive.

1076
01:21:52,100 --> 01:21:55,400
God, do you have to undermine
everything that I do?

1077
01:21:55,500 --> 01:21:57,800
You're such a player-hater.

1078
01:21:58,000 --> 01:21:59,600
You're a jerk.

1079
01:21:59,500 --> 01:22:02,400
Wow! Nice insult, Hannah Montana!

1080
01:22:02,500 --> 01:22:03,900
You got any more harsh digs?

1081
01:22:03,900 --> 01:22:05,600
You know what?

1082
01:22:05,800 --> 01:22:07,900
You were never a good friend.

1083
01:22:07,900 --> 01:22:10,800
Even when we were little.
You used to steal my toys...

1084
01:22:10,700 --> 01:22:14,800
..pour lemonade on my bed.
- And now I'm eating your boyfriend!

1085
01:22:14,800 --> 01:22:17,200
See, atleast I'm consistent.

1086
01:22:17,200 --> 01:22:20,200
Why do you need him? Huh?

1087
01:22:20,300 --> 01:22:23,000
You could have anybody,
you think want, Jennifer.

1088
01:22:22,900 --> 01:22:25,700
So..why Chip?

1089
01:22:25,700 --> 01:22:28,100
Is it just to piss me off?

1090
01:22:28,100 --> 01:22:31,800
Or is it because you're just really insecure?

1091
01:22:32,500 --> 01:22:34,500
I'm not insecure, Needy.

1092
01:22:34,500 --> 01:22:35,500
God, that's a joke!

1093
01:22:35,400 --> 01:22:39,400
How can I ever be insecure?
I was the Snowflake Queen!

1094
01:22:39,400 --> 01:22:40,800
Yeah...

1095
01:22:40,800 --> 01:22:43,400
..two years ago.
When you were socially relevant.

1096
01:22:43,400 --> 01:22:45,200
I'm still socially relevant.

1097
01:22:45,200 --> 01:22:48,900
And when you didn't need laxatives
to stay skinny.

1098
01:22:52,200 --> 01:22:54,100
I'm going...

1099
01:22:54,100 --> 01:22:56,400
..to eat your soul...

1100
01:22:56,400 --> 01:22:59,600
..and shit it out, Lesnicki.

1101
01:22:59,700 --> 01:23:01,600
I thought you only murdered boys.

1102
01:23:01,600 --> 01:23:03,400
I go both ways.

1103
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,000
Do you have a tampon?

1104
01:23:36,800 --> 01:23:38,500
Thought I'd ask.

1105
01:23:39,100 --> 01:23:41,500
You seemed like you might be plugging.

1106
01:24:01,800 --> 01:24:03,800
Oh, Chip!

1107
01:24:04,600 --> 01:24:06,600
Needy.

1108
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,000
I should have believed you.

1109
01:24:11,500 --> 01:24:12,700
I'm sorry.

1110
01:24:12,800 --> 01:24:16,400
No, no! Listen to me! Listen to me!
I'll dial & get some help, okay?

1111
01:24:16,400 --> 01:24:18,900
Okay?
Yeah, okay.

1112
01:24:25,700 --> 01:24:27,700
It's not working.

1113
01:24:29,800 --> 01:24:30,900
Come on.

1114
01:24:30,900 --> 01:24:32,900
Needy. Needy.

1115
01:24:34,300 --> 01:24:35,800
I'm going somewhere.

1116
01:24:35,800 --> 01:24:37,600
No! No, no, no.
you're not going anywhere.

1117
01:24:37,600 --> 01:24:39,300
Yes, I'm!

1118
01:24:39,600 --> 01:24:41,800
I think I already died before you got here,

1119
01:24:41,800 --> 01:24:44,700
..but I woke up when I heard your voice.

1120
01:24:47,100 --> 01:24:49,100
I love you.

1121
01:24:52,700 --> 01:24:54,800
I love you too.

1122
01:24:58,800 --> 01:25:01,600
And you look totally hot in that dress.

1123
01:25:01,700 --> 01:25:04,500
Oh, God!
You're clearly delirious.

1124
01:25:05,300 --> 01:25:07,300
No, I'm not.

1125
01:25:12,400 --> 01:25:13,500
Chip?

1126
01:25:13,700 --> 01:25:15,400
No!

1127
01:25:15,900 --> 01:25:17,900
No-o-o!

1128
01:25:22,700 --> 01:25:24,700
No...!

1129
01:26:37,300 --> 01:26:39,700
Best friends forever, huh?

1130
01:26:40,500 --> 01:26:42,500
You killed my fucking boyfriend!

1131
01:26:42,500 --> 01:26:46,300
You goddamned monster!
You..Zombitch!

1132
01:26:53,800 --> 01:26:55,800
You know what this is for?

1133
01:26:57,400 --> 01:26:59,500
It's for cutting boxes.

1134
01:27:01,800 --> 01:27:04,200
Do you buy all your  murder weapons
at Home Depot?

1135
01:27:04,200 --> 01:27:06,200
God, you're butch.

1136
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:10,800
Cross out Jennifer!

1137
01:28:23,400 --> 01:28:25,400
My tit!

1138
01:28:27,700 --> 01:28:29,000
No...

1139
01:28:29,200 --> 01:28:30,900
..your heart.

1140
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:53,500
Oh, Jennifer!
What's is it, baby?

1141
01:28:56,100 --> 01:28:58,100
Needy?

1142
01:28:58,800 --> 01:29:00,800
Oh, my God!

1143
01:29:01,400 --> 01:29:03,400
Oh, my God!

1144
01:29:07,400 --> 01:29:09,400
Oh, my God!

1145
01:29:25,800 --> 01:29:28,900
<i>I don't know who Needy Lesnicki
is anymore.</i>

1146
01:29:38,400 --> 01:29:40,100
<i>I'm a different person now.</i>

1147
01:29:40,300 --> 01:29:42,200
<i>A person who uses curse words...</i>

1148
01:29:42,200 --> 01:29:45,300
<i>..and kicks orderlies and sees things
that aren't there.</i>

1149
01:29:45,300 --> 01:29:48,100
<i>A very bad, very damaged person.</i>

1150
01:29:48,600 --> 01:29:51,000
<i>But sometimes, change can be good.</i>

1151
01:29:51,200 --> 01:29:53,600
<i>For instance, most occult scholars
don't know this...</i>

1152
01:29:53,600 --> 01:29:55,500
<i>..but if you're bitten by a demon...</i>

1153
01:29:55,600 --> 01:29:56,900
<i>..and you live...</i>

1154
01:29:57,100 --> 01:30:00,000
<i>..you just might absorb some of
the demon's abilities.</i>

1155
01:30:00,100 --> 01:30:03,300
<i>You just might get lucky for once
in your miserable life.</i>

1156
01:31:22,100 --> 01:31:26,300
Where you looking to go, young lady?
- East, towards Madisson.

1157
01:31:27,100 --> 01:31:29,100
Hop in my chariot.

1158
01:31:35,800 --> 01:31:37,800
So why you headed East?

1159
01:31:38,700 --> 01:31:40,700
I'm following this rock band.

1160
01:31:42,400 --> 01:31:44,400
Must be one in hell of a group.

1161
01:31:44,700 --> 01:31:47,100
Tonight's gonna be their last show.

1162
01:31:48,400 --> 01:31:50,400
<b>"Violet"

<i>And all the stars look just like little fish.</i>

1165
01:32:01,800 --> 01:32:05,200
<i>You should learn when to go.</i>

1166
01:32:07,600 --> 01:32:11,000
<i>You should learn how to say no.</i>

1167
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:15,800
<i>Might last a day, yeah-h-h!</i>

1168

01:32:24,400 --> 01:32:26,400

they never want it again.</i>

1176
01:32:52,300 --> 01:32:54,000
Go open the door.

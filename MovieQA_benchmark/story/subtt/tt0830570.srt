1
00:00:04,167 --> 00:00:05,217


2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074


3
00:00:54,375 --> 00:00:56,633
I can't think straight

4
00:00:58,273 --> 00:00:59,317
Please, be very careful.

5
00:01:12,011 --> 00:01:12,858
Hello?

6
00:01:13,214 --> 00:01:14,712
We could just elope, you know.

7
00:01:16,361 --> 00:01:18,863
But then you wouldn't get to see me
dressed like an extra of "Dynasty"

8
00:01:18,863 --> 00:01:21,725
So much to do...
Your hair looks perfect madam.

9
00:01:21,725 --> 00:01:22,974
When I want your opinion

10
00:01:22,974 --> 00:01:23,975
I'll give it to you.

11
00:01:24,681 --> 00:01:25,945
Madam?
That one.

12
00:01:25,945 --> 00:01:27,036
Thank you, madam.

13
00:01:29,235 --> 00:01:30,207
I need a cigarette.

14
00:01:30,707 --> 00:01:31,493
Are you busy?

15
00:01:31,493 --> 00:01:32,691
Almost...

16
00:01:32,691 --> 00:01:33,617
I'm working.

17
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:35,767
20 minutes before our engagement
party starts?

18
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:40,849
Where is my husband?

19
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:42,635
In the garden, madam.

20
00:01:44,213 --> 00:01:45,703
And where is my coffee?

21
00:01:45,703 --> 00:01:46,601
Coming, madam.

22
00:02:02,707 --> 00:02:04,006
Did the dress fit Tala?

23
00:02:05,183 --> 00:02:06,749
She didn't stop eating at lunch.

24
00:02:06,749 --> 00:02:08,659
Like a glove, madam.

25
00:02:09,427 --> 00:02:10,643
I love you...

26
00:02:10,643 --> 00:02:11,592
Bye Tala.

27
00:02:11,592 --> 00:02:13,242
Bye.

28
00:02:14,164 --> 00:02:17,124
And, Lamia? Did you take in her clothes?

29
00:02:17,124 --> 00:02:18,442
By two centimeters, madam.

30
00:02:18,442 --> 00:02:19,885
Excelent.

31
00:02:20,835 --> 00:02:22,926
Let's hope this is the final engagement party

32
00:02:22,926 --> 00:02:24,578
your father has to go through for your sister

33
00:02:25,012 --> 00:02:26,952
For a man of his statute to endure the shame...

34
00:02:31,948 --> 00:02:33,099
How do I look?

35
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:37,148
You could cover your shoulders
a little more.

36
00:02:37,437 --> 00:02:38,712
It's not cold.

37
00:02:42,231 --> 00:02:43,295
It's not proper.

38
00:02:48,944 --> 00:02:50,943
Did Zina like the green dress I picked for her?

39
00:02:51,212 --> 00:02:52,285
She loved it, madam.

40
00:02:54,216 --> 00:02:56,810
"Wear this, no black for your
sister's party. Mama"

41
00:03:03,603 --> 00:03:05,461
The cake, how does the cake look?

42
00:03:07,587 --> 00:03:08,413
Careful!

43
00:03:10,105 --> 00:03:11,512
It looks perfect, madam.

44
00:03:11,862 --> 00:03:13,351
Just perfect.

45
00:03:25,633 --> 00:03:27,840
Amman, Jordan

46
00:03:39,773 --> 00:03:41,278
She'll do it before dinner.

47
00:03:41,983 --> 00:03:44,202
No way, Tala loves her food too much.

48
00:03:44,963 --> 00:03:47,706
The last time she broke the engagement before dinner.

49
00:03:47,706 --> 00:03:48,848
And the first time

50
00:03:48,848 --> 00:03:51,214
she waited till Reema had a mouthfull of coffee.

51
00:03:51,706 --> 00:03:53,427
I just hope she keeps the jewelry this time

52
00:03:54,071 --> 00:03:55,693
8 karats, D flawless.

53
00:03:55,693 --> 00:03:56,550
Who wouldn't?

54
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:58,365
Tala never keeps the jewelry.

55
00:03:58,365 --> 00:04:00,239
She's always had a screw loose.

56
00:04:00,614 --> 00:04:01,780
And how is my favourite niece?

57
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:03,123
Dear Ramzi.

58
00:04:04,788 --> 00:04:05,906
Hello.

59
00:04:07,256 --> 00:04:08,194
You managed to get on a plane?

60
00:04:08,651 --> 00:04:09,269
Plane?

61
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,806
You know i'll never get on a plane

62
00:04:11,806 --> 00:04:13,028
not after that dream I...

63
00:04:13,332 --> 00:04:16,118
The crash... the devastation...

64
00:04:16,118 --> 00:04:17,994
The dream was in 1967...

65
00:04:17,994 --> 00:04:19,622
Right after the 6 day war.

66
00:04:19,622 --> 00:04:21,578
Israel has a lot to answer for.

67
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:24,704
Anyway, i wouldn't have missed it.

68
00:04:25,134 --> 00:04:28,807
I wanted to meet the man who made
it this far, again.

69
00:04:29,722 --> 00:04:31,563
Ammo, I love him.

70
00:04:31,563 --> 00:04:32,638
Of course you love him,

71
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:35,378
he's christian and he's rich.

72
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:38,084
Not to mention kind, thoughtful

73
00:04:38,084 --> 00:04:40,410
and foreward-thinking...

74
00:04:40,749 --> 00:04:42,693
and handsome.

75
00:04:43,443 --> 00:04:44,592
Handsome is good.

76
00:04:45,918 --> 00:04:47,870
But ask your aunty why she married me.

77
00:04:48,377 --> 00:04:49,750
Looks and character come and go...

78
00:04:50,383 --> 00:04:53,049
only large sums of money last forever.

79
00:04:53,049 --> 00:04:54,664
So it would seem.

80
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:03,391
You look amazing, sweetheart.

81
00:05:03,391 --> 00:05:04,961
Wish I could say the same.

82
00:05:05,179 --> 00:05:09,220
That's because i've been alone with
mum and Lamia for four whole days.

83
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:10,071
You know,

84
00:05:10,071 --> 00:05:12,955
I think I found those weapons
of mass destruction Bush was looking for

85
00:05:12,955 --> 00:05:16,528
How clever of him to disguise them
as to arab housewives.

86
00:05:17,104 --> 00:05:19,998
Zina, that dress looks beautiful on you.

87
00:05:20,365 --> 00:05:22,379
Mama said you should be entertaining your guests.

88
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,451
Yeah, Tala.

89
00:05:23,671 --> 00:05:27,112
Surely you should be familiar with
engagement parties etiquette by now...

90
00:05:40,894 --> 00:05:42,658
She looks so happy, doesn't she, Reema?

91
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:44,368
Of course.

92
00:05:44,605 --> 00:05:45,892
And beautiful.

93
00:05:46,157 --> 00:05:47,679
Just like her mother.

94
00:06:27,561 --> 00:06:30,012
No, no, no. No I don't think so.

95
00:06:30,235 --> 00:06:33,124
I understand what you're saying but I think that
10 procent

96
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:35,599
is the maxim you can expect of that...

97
00:06:39,224 --> 00:06:43,409
Don't worry, we'll talk tomorrow. Goodbye.

98
00:06:50,409 --> 00:06:51,746
I thought you'd gone for the day.

99
00:06:53,128 --> 00:06:54,857
The printer's not working at home.

100
00:06:55,712 --> 00:06:56,998
What are you printing?

101
00:06:57,348 --> 00:06:59,833
Umm, just some bits and pieces.

102
00:07:01,243 --> 00:07:03,043
Come on. Come on.

103
00:07:07,156 --> 00:07:07,692
Sit down.

104
00:07:08,975 --> 00:07:10,400
You have a minute don't you?

105
00:07:11,288 --> 00:07:13,539
All this is going to be yours one day, you know?

106
00:07:13,539 --> 00:07:14,261
All of it?

107
00:07:14,261 --> 00:07:15,475
And your sister's.

108
00:07:15,794 --> 00:07:17,329
But sales are everything.

109
00:07:17,964 --> 00:07:19,665
They're the life blood of this place.

110
00:07:19,989 --> 00:07:21,588
You know I'm not good at selling, dad.

111
00:07:22,033 --> 00:07:23,317
You don't sell life insurance...

112
00:07:23,317 --> 00:07:25,340
I know, I know...It sells itself.

113
00:07:26,044 --> 00:07:28,072
Life insurance is a sure bet.

114
00:07:28,636 --> 00:07:29,737
I just ask my client:

115
00:07:30,103 --> 00:07:31,749
"Do you know you're going to die?"

116
00:07:32,329 --> 00:07:33,460
There is only one answer.

117
00:07:33,808 --> 00:07:34,574
Then I ask him:

118
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,846
"Are you 150% absolutely positively happy

119
00:07:39,118 --> 00:07:41,864
that your wife and your kids are
properly taken care of?"

120
00:07:42,085 --> 00:07:43,550
You've got him.

121
00:07:43,768 --> 00:07:44,797
Come on, try it.

122
00:07:45,491 --> 00:07:46,967
Dad...

123
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:48,889
Oh, come on. I'm your client.

124
00:07:49,363 --> 00:07:50,000
Try it.

125
00:07:51,362 --> 00:07:52,365
I'm sorry, dad.

126
00:07:52,365 --> 00:07:54,517
I'm good with the admin,
and Yasmin's better with people...

127
00:07:55,369 --> 00:07:56,199
She's a waitress.

128
00:07:56,199 --> 00:07:58,220
She's learning so she can start her own food company.

129
00:07:58,555 --> 00:08:00,870
Three years at university so she can wash dishes.

130
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:01,853
She doesn't need her own company

131
00:08:01,853 --> 00:08:03,475
she has her own company.

132
00:08:04,427 --> 00:08:05,827
I have a date with Ali tonight.

133
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:08,751
I like him. He's a good boy.

134
00:08:09,633 --> 00:08:10,918
Are you going to the mosque first?

135
00:08:10,918 --> 00:08:12,225
We're heading into town to see a friend of his,

136
00:08:12,225 --> 00:08:14,192
then we're having dinner.

137
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:15,580
It's Friday.

138
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:18,669
I believe in our religion, I do, I just...

139
00:08:18,871 --> 00:08:20,756
I don't like to get on when everyone else does.

140
00:08:21,701 --> 00:08:23,514
If you don't go when everyone else does,

141
00:08:23,514 --> 00:08:25,791
how will they know you're a good muslim?

142
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,837
Go on then, but don't be out too late.

143
00:08:29,583 --> 00:08:31,164
I'm not 16, dad.

144
00:08:31,516 --> 00:08:32,536
I know...

145
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,107
So she's palestinian, your friend?

146
00:08:52,107 --> 00:08:54,828
Yes, she lives in London but her
wedding will be back in Jordan

147
00:08:54,828 --> 00:08:56,407
where I was for her engagement party.

148
00:08:56,407 --> 00:08:57,576
You remember?

149
00:08:58,739 --> 00:09:00,040
What does Tala do?

150
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:03,070
Think she has some of her grandfather's spirit in her.

151
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:05,487
You know she's recently bought a company over here

152
00:09:06,031 --> 00:09:08,958
For an arab woman from her background
that's pretty unusual.

153
00:09:10,577 --> 00:09:13,056
What's the matter? Are you nervous?

154
00:09:13,056 --> 00:09:13,972
A bit.

155
00:09:13,972 --> 00:09:15,412
I'm always like that with new people

156
00:09:15,412 --> 00:09:16,409
Don't be. Tala's great.

157
00:09:16,409 --> 00:09:17,856
Trust me you'll love her.

158
00:09:17,856 --> 00:09:19,274
Evening.
Evening.

159
00:09:27,369 --> 00:09:29,147
How long have you and Ali been dating?

160
00:09:29,969 --> 00:09:31,364
About two months.

161
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:35,033
And? Does he want to marry you?

162
00:09:36,949 --> 00:09:38,874
I think he's just waiting for me to ask him.

163
00:09:39,635 --> 00:09:43,498
Tala, my eldest daughter is
getting married in six weeks.

164
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:45,302
And what does your father do?

165
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:48,108
Stop interrogating the
poor girl, mama. - Hey...

166
00:09:49,147 --> 00:09:50,367
She's going out with Ali.

167
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:51,509
Not me.

168
00:09:51,509 --> 00:09:52,955
Tala, meet Leyla.

169
00:09:53,976 --> 00:09:54,989
Hello

170
00:09:57,278 --> 00:09:59,182
Sorry to break your british reserve,

171
00:09:59,182 --> 00:10:00,868
but we always kiss in Jordan.

172
00:10:01,169 --> 00:10:02,768
Usually just before we slit your throat.

173
00:10:03,562 --> 00:10:06,523
When are you going to stop criticizing our homeland, Tala?

174
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:08,742
When everyone else stops being afraid to.

175
00:10:09,646 --> 00:10:11,215
How do you and Ali know each other?

176
00:10:11,713 --> 00:10:13,757
He went to school with my third fiancé.

177
00:10:13,965 --> 00:10:15,300
They were at Cornell together.

178
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:17,144
She's had four, you know.

179
00:10:17,144 --> 00:10:18,667
Fiancés I mean.

180
00:10:18,667 --> 00:10:19,291
Four?

181
00:10:19,291 --> 00:10:20,581
She's still picky.

182
00:10:20,581 --> 00:10:22,464
I always liked Namir.
Mama...

183
00:10:22,464 --> 00:10:23,736
He was a drug addict.

184
00:10:23,736 --> 00:10:25,875
He's from a very respectable family.

185
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:27,270
Yeah, and during our engagement party

186
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:29,953
I caught him with white powder on his nose.

187
00:10:29,953 --> 00:10:31,839
You always jump to conclusions.

188
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:34,049
Maybe he was trying to hide a skin blemish.

189
00:10:34,573 --> 00:10:37,509
He had some  pock-marks on one side of his face.

190
00:10:37,806 --> 00:10:41,179
Tala, I've just had your wedding dress taken in.

191
00:10:41,179 --> 00:10:42,956
COngratulations on your wedding.

192
00:10:43,439 --> 00:10:44,344
Will it be in a mosque?

193
00:10:44,344 --> 00:10:45,108
A church.

194
00:10:45,108 --> 00:10:46,461
A church...

195
00:10:46,461 --> 00:10:48,404
Not all arabs are muslims.

196
00:10:48,404 --> 00:10:49,972
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have assumed...

197
00:10:49,972 --> 00:10:51,178
Are you a muslim?

198
00:10:51,178 --> 00:10:52,025
Yes.

199
00:10:52,025 --> 00:10:53,332
Why?

200
00:10:53,332 --> 00:10:55,847
Tala, what kind of question is that?

201
00:10:55,847 --> 00:10:57,559
Because she was born a muslim.

202
00:10:57,559 --> 00:10:59,019
No, she wasn't.

203
00:10:59,019 --> 00:11:00,080
Weren't you?

204
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:04,803
She was born a female and a member
of a certain race and...

205
00:11:04,803 --> 00:11:08,791
if she'd been adopted by a jewish
family she'd've been jewish.

206
00:11:08,791 --> 00:11:10,634
Thank God she wasn't adopted.

207
00:11:10,634 --> 00:11:14,289
What the Middle East doesn't need is more jews.

208
00:11:14,289 --> 00:11:17,188
Mama, please don't start with the anti-Semitism.

209
00:11:17,188 --> 00:11:20,649
Anti-Sematic? Who's Anti-sematic?

210
00:11:20,891 --> 00:11:23,126
I am semity, that's the point.

211
00:11:23,421 --> 00:11:26,442
And yet the israelies grid Palestine from us.

212
00:11:26,442 --> 00:11:27,465
And arab countries throw out

213
00:11:27,465 --> 00:11:29,050
over a million a year of jews.

214
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:31,616
But the israeli should be fair to the  palestinians.

215
00:11:31,822 --> 00:11:33,126
They know what it's like to lose their land.

216
00:11:33,476 --> 00:11:34,928
Now someone's speaking sense.

217
00:11:34,928 --> 00:11:38,263
True. But we need to draw a line
under the past and look forward

218
00:11:38,638 --> 00:11:41,293
Your headache medicine, madam.

219
00:11:43,729 --> 00:11:45,260
I don't have a headache.

220
00:11:46,965 --> 00:11:48,601
But it's seven o'clock, madam.

221
00:11:49,769 --> 00:11:52,366
Well, then I haven't adjusted to London time, yet.

222
00:11:53,194 --> 00:11:54,124
Nice to have met you.

223
00:11:54,124 --> 00:11:55,964
I apologise for my daughter.

224
00:11:56,259 --> 00:11:58,021
Good night.
See you.

225
00:12:02,661 --> 00:12:03,862
You didn't answer my question.

226
00:12:03,862 --> 00:12:05,021
I'm not jewish.

227
00:12:06,133 --> 00:12:06,811
Why not?

228
00:12:06,811 --> 00:12:08,034
Why aren't you?

229
00:12:08,034 --> 00:12:09,588
I don't subscribe to any religion.

230
00:12:09,588 --> 00:12:10,840
So you live without any faith?

231
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,422
Ah, I didn't say that.

232
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:14,639
Why should my believes offend you?

233
00:12:14,992 --> 00:12:16,021
They don't.

234
00:12:16,021 --> 00:12:17,967
I just want to know why they don't offend you.

235
00:12:18,653 --> 00:12:20,364
Tala, ease up.

236
00:12:20,364 --> 00:12:22,580
Don't they do small talk in the Middle East?

237
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:24,277
This is small talk in the Middle East.

238
00:12:24,556 --> 00:12:26,798
For serious debate we move on to politics.

239
00:12:27,065 --> 00:12:28,079
And before that happens

240
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:29,927
I'm gonna take Leyla to dinner.

241
00:12:30,488 --> 00:12:32,071
D'you wanna bluff your parents and join us?

242
00:12:32,623 --> 00:12:34,489
They're going back to Jordan tomorrow...

243
00:12:35,773 --> 00:12:37,955
But thank you... both...

244
00:12:38,401 --> 00:12:40,021
Perhaps another time.

245
00:12:40,248 --> 00:12:41,067
I'd like that.

246
00:12:41,067 --> 00:12:43,270
We can be all british and talk about the weather.

247
00:12:44,018 --> 00:12:44,822
You are naughty.

248
00:12:52,853 --> 00:12:54,785
Leyla! The guests are due.

249
00:13:02,403 --> 00:13:03,280
Come on!

250
00:13:08,993 --> 00:13:10,734
I don't understand why Ali can't eat with us first?

251
00:13:12,074 --> 00:13:13,500
He's hooked a tennis court, mum.

252
00:13:13,916 --> 00:13:14,792
At one o'clock?

253
00:13:14,792 --> 00:13:15,885
That's lunch time.

254
00:13:15,885 --> 00:13:17,897
Only in the suburban house mum though,
I believe London's...

255
00:13:17,897 --> 00:13:19,894
what 2 hours ahead of us?

256
00:13:19,894 --> 00:13:21,157
Or would that be two years?

257
00:13:21,157 --> 00:13:22,832
You and your cosmopolitan attitude.

258
00:13:23,739 --> 00:13:25,472
What kind of salad are you making anyway?

259
00:13:25,919 --> 00:13:27,038
It's a greek salad.

260
00:13:27,038 --> 00:13:28,823
Oh, and an indian salad isn't good enough for you.

261
00:13:28,823 --> 00:13:31,266
Mum, what is an indian salad?
Lettuce leaves and chilies?

262
00:13:32,405 --> 00:13:34,756
You two are so worried about other cultures.

263
00:13:35,311 --> 00:13:36,490
London... Greece...

264
00:13:37,075 --> 00:13:38,417
What about your own heritage.

265
00:13:38,941 --> 00:13:40,147
Did you ever think about that?

266
00:13:40,623 --> 00:13:43,373
India has one of the richest cultures in the world.

267
00:13:43,373 --> 00:13:44,747
Well, I'm glad you said that, mum.

268
00:13:44,747 --> 00:13:46,972
Coz I'm thinking of spending 6 months out there.

269
00:13:47,351 --> 00:13:48,311
Backpacking.

270
00:13:48,313 --> 00:13:52,471
You are not going backpacking and in
India of all places...

271
00:13:52,471 --> 00:13:54,043
What about the culture, the heritage?

272
00:13:54,043 --> 00:13:56,262
What about being rapped and murdered?

273
00:13:56,498 --> 00:13:57,621
And clean underwear?

274
00:13:57,621 --> 00:13:59,296
I don't think you should take underwear, Yasmin.

275
00:14:00,718 --> 00:14:02,217
What if you meet people we know?

276
00:14:02,536 --> 00:14:05,192
They'll think we can't afford
to send you on a real holliday.

277
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,025
Mum, there like a billion people in India.

278
00:14:07,025 --> 00:14:10,187
What are the chances that I'm gonna bump
into someone from your Surrey Bridge Club.

279
00:14:12,155 --> 00:14:13,198
Ali!

280
00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:16,082
Are you going to the door dressed like that?

281
00:14:16,482 --> 00:14:18,734
We're going to play tennis, mum.

282
00:14:20,555 --> 00:14:21,213
What's that smell?

283
00:14:21,213 --> 00:14:22,153
Fetta cheese.

284
00:14:22,478 --> 00:14:23,503
Hi.
Hi.

285
00:14:24,591 --> 00:14:25,385
How are you?

286
00:14:27,567 --> 00:14:28,599
Ali!

287
00:14:28,599 --> 00:14:30,754
Hi, Auntie. Hello. How are you?

288
00:14:30,754 --> 00:14:32,111
First class.

289
00:14:32,488 --> 00:14:34,183
Hi, uncle.
Hello, Ali.

290
00:14:35,072 --> 00:14:36,519
Mmm, somthing smells good in here.

291
00:14:36,519 --> 00:14:38,174
Thank you. That's my greek salad.

292
00:14:38,174 --> 00:14:39,745
Hey, Yasmin, I didn't know you could cook.

293
00:14:39,745 --> 00:14:41,085
Of course she can.

294
00:14:41,085 --> 00:14:42,533
And so can Leyla,

295
00:14:42,748 --> 00:14:45,628
who makes the best cakes
and never puts on weight.

296
00:14:46,227 --> 00:14:47,583
Yeah, that's our Leyla.

297
00:14:47,583 --> 00:14:50,087
She's gonna
make a wonderful housewife someday.

298
00:14:50,977 --> 00:14:52,117
And apparently she knows how to sell

299
00:14:52,117 --> 00:14:54,054
life insurance with the best of them.

300
00:14:54,054 --> 00:14:56,008
How many times do i have to tell you?

301
00:14:56,751 --> 00:14:58,239
It sells itself.

302
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:00,076
We should be going.
Bye, uncle.

303
00:15:00,076 --> 00:15:01,599
Oh, next time come for lunch.

304
00:15:01,599 --> 00:15:02,914
Oh, I'd love to, next time.

305
00:15:02,914 --> 00:15:04,333
Come on.
OK, OK...

306
00:15:06,346 --> 00:15:08,890
Let's hope she has the sense to hold onto him.

307
00:15:09,465 --> 00:15:10,699
Like a life raft.

308
00:15:15,734 --> 00:15:16,754
Mum!..

309
00:15:19,832 --> 00:15:22,280
Oh, by the way. We're meeting
some friends at the club.

310
00:15:22,731 --> 00:15:23,768
Hope that's OK.

311
00:15:24,129 --> 00:15:25,532
Scared I'll beat you one on one?

312
00:15:26,453 --> 00:15:27,538
Terrified...

313
00:15:28,628 --> 00:15:29,931
Who're you playing with?

314
00:15:29,931 --> 00:15:30,978
You remember Tala?

315
00:15:31,304 --> 00:15:32,951
Oh, and another friend of mine, Jeff.

316
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:36,976
Actually, I owe Jeff a game so you
can play Tala.

317
00:15:37,612 --> 00:15:38,573
Is that OK?

318
00:15:40,053 --> 00:15:41,036
Fine.

319
00:15:41,819 --> 00:15:44,544
Hey, how are you guys doing?

320
00:15:44,544 --> 00:15:45,424
Hope you've been practicing.

321
00:15:45,424 --> 00:15:47,734
Yeah, right.
Hey, how are you? Good

322
00:15:48,017 --> 00:15:49,232
Hello.

323
00:15:54,863 --> 00:15:56,218
Come, we'll play.

324
00:15:56,529 --> 00:15:57,473
How are you?

325
00:16:10,315 --> 00:16:12,347
They have a really great coach
here...

326
00:16:12,608 --> 00:16:13,674
if you want a lesson...

327
00:16:58,361 --> 00:16:59,556
That was amazing.

328
00:17:00,043 --> 00:17:01,012
You're pretty good.

329
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:03,729
You're not so bad yourself.

330
00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:06,237
This way.

331
00:17:06,831 --> 00:17:08,106
I'll show you the changing-rooms.

332
00:17:11,309 --> 00:17:12,341
That was quite a comeback.

333
00:17:13,210 --> 00:17:14,648
I prayed for divine intervention.

334
00:17:18,331 --> 00:17:20,711
I didn't say that there wasn't a God.

335
00:17:20,917 --> 00:17:23,329
It's just religion that bothers me.

336
00:17:24,776 --> 00:17:26,055
Sorry if I offended you.

337
00:17:27,312 --> 00:17:28,558
On the contrary,

338
00:17:28,558 --> 00:17:30,123
you made me think.

339
00:17:30,494 --> 00:17:31,899
Yeah? Of what?

340
00:17:31,899 --> 00:17:33,042
About... Thank you.

341
00:17:33,042 --> 00:17:35,248
how we follow certain paths.

342
00:17:35,248 --> 00:17:37,789
Is it just expectation or conditioning?

343
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:45,314
Let me take a look at that.

344
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:46,395
It's alright.

345
00:17:46,395 --> 00:17:47,894
I'm always clumsy.

346
00:17:48,992 --> 00:17:49,884
You know you should...

347
00:17:49,884 --> 00:17:51,785
you should really relax more...

348
00:17:51,785 --> 00:17:53,990
Just be at ease with yourself.

349
00:17:57,132 --> 00:17:58,831
Maybe a shower will help.
They're over there.

350
00:17:59,541 --> 00:18:00,537
Alright.

351
00:18:06,766 --> 00:18:08,832
So, are you coming for the polo match tomorrow?

352
00:18:09,125 --> 00:18:11,773
Honey, as much as I'd like to see
you fooling your ass,

353
00:18:12,350 --> 00:18:14,018
no can do tomorrow.Rugby's on.

354
00:18:14,018 --> 00:18:15,660
It's just a practice game.

355
00:18:16,098 --> 00:18:17,322
It's usually fun.

356
00:18:17,322 --> 00:18:19,687
I'm supposed to have lunch with my family tomorrow.

357
00:18:19,687 --> 00:18:21,379
Hey, I'm sure they won't mind.

358
00:18:21,379 --> 00:18:24,673
Think of all the fun you'll have turning divets.
Just watch where you tread.

359
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:32,324
You missed lunch yesterday and now
you want to miss it today?!

360
00:18:32,642 --> 00:18:33,865
It's Sunday.

361
00:18:35,641 --> 00:18:37,662
Why don't you ask Ali to come for lunch?

362
00:18:38,418 --> 00:18:39,671
He could meet Nanima.

363
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,025
He's taking me to a polo match, mum.

364
00:18:42,025 --> 00:18:43,595
Polo? You mean the game.

365
00:18:43,595 --> 00:18:45,274
No, mum, she means the mints.

366
00:18:45,274 --> 00:18:48,194
All those horses and sweating south-americans.

367
00:18:48,194 --> 00:18:49,650
Will prince Charles be there?

368
00:18:50,138 --> 00:18:51,989
Well, at least you're making an effort for a change.

369
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:55,190
What's that?

370
00:19:54,501 --> 00:19:55,193
Excuse me.

371
00:19:55,193 --> 00:19:56,102
Sure.

372
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:59,066
Hello.
Leyla?

373
00:19:59,066 --> 00:20:00,126
Hi, dad...

374
00:20:01,089 --> 00:20:03,501
Listen, we're gonna be later than I thought.

375
00:20:03,501 --> 00:20:05,314
Ali's really into the Polo.

376
00:20:05,314 --> 00:20:07,025
He just called.
Who just called?

377
00:20:07,025 --> 00:20:07,875
Ali.

378
00:20:08,105 --> 00:20:10,725
He asked if you wanted to go over
to his place to watch rugby

379
00:20:10,945 --> 00:20:12,245
after you got back.

380
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,506
I didn't tell your mother, Betta.

381
00:20:16,178 --> 00:20:17,708
Thanks, dad.

382
00:20:24,274 --> 00:20:25,659
Thanks Antoinette. See you later.

383
00:20:28,245 --> 00:20:30,096
Hello.
Hello.

384
00:20:31,552 --> 00:20:32,531
Impressed...

385
00:20:32,927 --> 00:20:35,513
I didn't even break out in a sweat..

386
00:20:38,051 --> 00:20:39,558
I kept thinking you were gonna fall.

387
00:20:39,864 --> 00:20:41,633
leaning, of course, on a horse like that.

388
00:20:42,722 --> 00:20:43,972
I like to take chances.

389
00:20:46,477 --> 00:20:48,203
Is that why you left your family's business?

390
00:20:49,557 --> 00:20:51,712
I wanted to see if I could create my own brand.

391
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:54,712
I'm impressed...

392
00:20:54,933 --> 00:20:56,138
No, don't be.

393
00:20:56,138 --> 00:20:57,417
Not yet at least.

394
00:20:57,417 --> 00:20:59,328
I've yet to get a decent order.

395
00:20:59,328 --> 00:21:01,116
But something should come up soon.

396
00:21:03,958 --> 00:21:05,393
How about you?

397
00:21:05,393 --> 00:21:07,792
Me? Nothing to tell.

398
00:21:07,792 --> 00:21:09,673
My dad encouraged me to join his company

399
00:21:09,673 --> 00:21:11,120
and I've never left.

400
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,523
And? You like it there?

401
00:21:13,759 --> 00:21:15,883
It's not exactly inspiring.

402
00:21:16,399 --> 00:21:18,277
So what inspires you, Leyla?

403
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:23,199
Writing... Fiction...

404
00:21:24,937 --> 00:21:26,625
Can I read some of your stuff?

405
00:21:29,026 --> 00:21:32,912
How else am I gonna find out what
goes on beneath that quiet exterior?

406
00:21:40,765 --> 00:21:41,997
Let's...

407
00:22:07,151 --> 00:22:08,459
Hello.

408
00:22:10,772 --> 00:22:11,948
Really?

409
00:22:58,707 --> 00:23:00,217
You have an amazing talent.

410
00:23:01,229 --> 00:23:02,988
I'm... just learning.

411
00:23:04,294 --> 00:23:06,039
Make sure you do something with it.

412
00:23:09,699 --> 00:23:11,675
Have you really been engaged four times?

413
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:15,859
I mean, you seem like such a decisive person.

414
00:23:16,985 --> 00:23:18,529
Yeah, well, I'm not proud of it.

415
00:23:20,074 --> 00:23:21,514
You know about the last guy.

416
00:23:21,913 --> 00:23:23,520
He had a problem with drugs.

417
00:23:26,131 --> 00:23:27,112
The second guy.

418
00:23:27,112 --> 00:23:28,204
Well he ticked all the boxes.

419
00:23:28,204 --> 00:23:32,851
He's christian-arab, good family,
handsome, intelligent

420
00:23:32,851 --> 00:23:34,382
It just didn't click.

421
00:23:34,718 --> 00:23:36,002
I can understand that.

422
00:23:37,927 --> 00:23:39,254
And the first?

423
00:23:39,833 --> 00:23:42,415
Well, that was a big mistake I
let my mother pressurize me into.

424
00:23:43,187 --> 00:23:45,794
He produces tons of dates...

425
00:23:46,495 --> 00:23:47,691
my mother loves dates.

426
00:23:48,481 --> 00:23:49,987
You can never have too many dates.

427
00:23:49,987 --> 00:23:52,540
Oh, trust me, I found out you can.

428
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:57,715
How about you? What about you and Ali?
How is that going?

429
00:24:00,014 --> 00:24:01,367
I like him a lot.

430
00:24:01,707 --> 00:24:03,241
Does it click?

431
00:24:03,765 --> 00:24:05,404
Not the way I imagined it should.

432
00:24:05,404 --> 00:24:07,396
Well... maybe we expect too much.

433
00:24:09,432 --> 00:24:10,681
It's starting to rain.

434
00:24:11,616 --> 00:24:15,636
Oxford! Oxford's where you go to get
the degree not to get away.

435
00:24:16,255 --> 00:24:17,298
It's ony an hour by train.

436
00:24:17,298 --> 00:24:18,944
Why do you have to go for two days?

437
00:24:19,153 --> 00:24:21,167
So if it takes me three hours I can stay the night?

438
00:24:21,769 --> 00:24:22,992
Oh, my God.

439
00:24:24,814 --> 00:24:26,242
What is that?

440
00:24:26,642 --> 00:24:27,761
It's ethiopian bread.

441
00:24:28,661 --> 00:24:31,579
We have indian bread right here.

442
00:24:32,029 --> 00:24:34,017
Anyway, I thought they were starving in Ethyopia.

443
00:24:34,382 --> 00:24:36,999
Yeah, well, if they had bread, then 
this is what it would look like.

444
00:24:37,772 --> 00:24:38,893
Who are you going with?

445
00:24:39,384 --> 00:24:40,807
A friend.

446
00:24:41,528 --> 00:24:43,455
Oh, Ali.

447
00:24:43,759 --> 00:24:44,904
No, not Ali.

448
00:24:44,904 --> 00:24:47,060
Does everything have
to revolve around him?

449
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:55,772
She has a friend and they're going
away for a couple of days.

450
00:24:56,068 --> 00:24:57,714
Why do you make everything a problem?

451
00:25:14,234 --> 00:25:15,295
Don't let her get to you Ley.

452
00:25:15,295 --> 00:25:17,087
She's not... she's not getting to me.

453
00:25:18,351 --> 00:25:19,490
What's wrong?

454
00:25:20,243 --> 00:25:21,734
Are you two-timing Ali?

455
00:25:22,051 --> 00:25:23,448
Of course not. You know me,

456
00:25:23,448 --> 00:25:25,155
I can bearly go out with one guy properly.

457
00:25:25,925 --> 00:25:27,244
Yeah, why is that?

458
00:25:54,372 --> 00:25:57,113
Is there anything you want to talk to me about?

459
00:25:57,937 --> 00:25:59,057
No.

460
00:25:59,057 --> 00:26:01,261
I mean... anything.

461
00:26:02,807 --> 00:26:04,214
You lied to mum and dad last week.

462
00:26:04,621 --> 00:26:06,308
About the polo with Ali.

463
00:26:06,308 --> 00:26:08,843
I know. I can't believe I did that.

464
00:26:08,843 --> 00:26:11,948
No, it was about time if you ask me.
But why?

465
00:26:12,621 --> 00:26:13,768
Who are you going to Oxford with?

466
00:26:14,109 --> 00:26:15,499
Nobody.

467
00:26:15,499 --> 00:26:17,050
Just Tala.

468
00:26:18,439 --> 00:26:19,884
I see...

469
00:26:20,596 --> 00:26:22,643
What? What do you see?

470
00:26:23,333 --> 00:26:24,113
Well, nothing.

471
00:26:24,113 --> 00:26:25,823
It's just that you've been spending
a lot of time with this Tala,

472
00:26:25,823 --> 00:26:27,070
haven't you?

473
00:26:27,965 --> 00:26:29,304
She's nice.

474
00:26:29,304 --> 00:26:30,661
Nice?

475
00:26:30,661 --> 00:26:33,162
Nice as in mum's bridge club
ladies nice or nice as in...

476
00:26:33,704 --> 00:26:34,679
hot?

477
00:26:34,679 --> 00:26:36,335
What's wrong with you?

478
00:26:36,335 --> 00:26:38,206
Her family's sponsoring a charity event

479
00:26:38,206 --> 00:26:40,048
and her sister's going to be there, OK?

480
00:26:40,374 --> 00:26:41,509
OK...

481
00:26:42,673 --> 00:26:45,222
Do you two think that lunch will make itslef.

482
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:48,981
No, but that lettuce leaf's walked 
out of fridge on its own.

483
00:26:51,131 --> 00:26:52,927
Come and take this horrible bread

484
00:26:53,154 --> 00:26:55,366
and send it to Africa where it belongs.

485
00:27:11,376 --> 00:27:12,948
Have you ever been to Oxford before?

486
00:27:12,948 --> 00:27:14,105
Oh, I love it.

487
00:27:14,105 --> 00:27:15,890
There's something magical about it,

488
00:27:15,890 --> 00:27:17,566
especially the buildings.

489
00:27:18,344 --> 00:27:20,752
"That sweet city with her dreaming spires".

490
00:27:22,382 --> 00:27:23,712
Matthew Arnold?

491
00:27:24,389 --> 00:27:25,233
Mhmm...

492
00:27:28,045 --> 00:27:29,426
Shall we go see the library?

493
00:27:29,426 --> 00:27:30,835
I'd love to.

494
00:27:32,079 --> 00:27:33,167
What's Lamia doing?

495
00:27:33,167 --> 00:27:35,037
Buying a picnic hamper.

496
00:27:45,459 --> 00:27:46,708
Is she upset with us?

497
00:27:46,708 --> 00:27:47,846
Just with me.

498
00:27:47,846 --> 00:27:49,437
She wants me to show up for the wedding.

499
00:27:49,437 --> 00:27:50,893
In Oxford?

500
00:27:50,893 --> 00:27:53,675
Well, I've refused to meet her in Paris.

501
00:28:04,081 --> 00:28:06,918
Here, Leyla. Try it.

502
00:28:06,948 --> 00:28:08,946
Mmm, that is amazing.

503
00:28:10,571 --> 00:28:12,015
Lamia, would you like to try some?

504
00:28:12,363 --> 00:28:13,553
I don't do carbs.

505
00:28:13,553 --> 00:28:15,015
Since when?

506
00:28:15,863 --> 00:28:17,414
Lamia, you used to study here, right?

507
00:28:17,741 --> 00:28:19,427
What subject?

508
00:28:19,427 --> 00:28:21,214
Flower arranging.

509
00:28:21,881 --> 00:28:24,374
So... I hear you didn't get the order.

510
00:28:25,074 --> 00:28:26,873
Well maybe now you can come back and help Baba

511
00:28:27,107 --> 00:28:28,736
and stop all this independent stuff.

512
00:28:29,115 --> 00:28:30,731
You know, Leyla's the most brilliant writer.

513
00:28:31,276 --> 00:28:32,372
You have to read her stuff.

514
00:28:32,372 --> 00:28:35,467
No, no, no. I'm just learning. But I
do love it.

515
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:39,572
One day soon you will read her stuff in bookstores.

516
00:28:42,728 --> 00:28:46,210
Could you publish an edition with pictures in it?

517
00:28:48,263 --> 00:28:49,053
Shall we walk some more?

518
00:28:49,053 --> 00:28:50,461
No.
Yes.

519
00:28:50,461 --> 00:28:51,912
Whatever you prefer.

520
00:28:52,288 --> 00:28:53,689
I need to get back to the room.

521
00:28:53,994 --> 00:28:55,723
Karrem always checks where I am.

522
00:28:56,377 --> 00:28:58,128
Tell him that you're busy.

523
00:28:58,128 --> 00:28:59,732
Are you coming with me?

524
00:29:01,182 --> 00:29:04,304
No. Come on.

525
00:29:08,219 --> 00:29:11,737
It's exactly that kind of relationship
I wanted to avoid...

526
00:29:12,117 --> 00:29:13,352
at all costs.

527
00:29:14,642 --> 00:29:16,360
So your fiancé is not like that?

528
00:29:16,818 --> 00:29:18,405
Hani? No.

529
00:29:18,810 --> 00:29:22,753
He's an arab and was born
and brought up in Jordan.

530
00:29:23,110 --> 00:29:24,757
But he's different from the rest.

531
00:29:25,477 --> 00:29:27,779
Kind, open-minded.

532
00:29:28,543 --> 00:29:29,953
And he makes a great Martini.

533
00:29:30,784 --> 00:29:32,249
He sounds wonderful.

534
00:29:32,249 --> 00:29:33,996
Yeah, he is.

535
00:29:37,587 --> 00:29:38,788
He is...

536
00:29:39,497 --> 00:29:41,340
At least I can't find
anything wrong with him.

537
00:29:41,810 --> 00:29:43,354
Why are you trying?

538
00:29:48,472 --> 00:29:49,759
Thank you.

539
00:29:50,238 --> 00:29:51,308
For what?

540
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:53,626
For all this.

541
00:29:54,912 --> 00:29:56,387
It's overwhelming.

542
00:29:57,866 --> 00:30:00,630
You know it's been a while since I've
seen it all through new eyes.

543
00:30:02,163 --> 00:30:03,345
Thank you.

544
00:30:26,888 --> 00:30:28,806
I've absolutely no sense of rhythm.

545
00:30:30,154 --> 00:30:31,293
Come here.

546
00:32:39,213 --> 00:32:40,697
What are you thinking about?

547
00:32:43,208 --> 00:32:45,247
Why I didn't meet you years ago.

548
00:32:51,391 --> 00:32:53,404
We'd have been underaged.

549
00:33:26,639 --> 00:33:31,266
Hello. Hi Hani. I'm fine.

550
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:33,170
Can I call you later.

551
00:33:33,837 --> 00:33:35,099
No, nothing's wrong.

552
00:33:35,392 --> 00:33:36,542
I just woke up.

553
00:33:37,363 --> 00:33:39,918
I'll call you in a while, OK?

554
00:33:40,552 --> 00:33:41,278
Bye.

555
00:33:42,957 --> 00:33:44,179
Yeah, I love you too.

556
00:33:56,591 --> 00:33:58,330
Have you ever done this before?

557
00:34:00,590 --> 00:34:03,538
Slept with a woman when my fiance
makes wedding preparations?

558
00:34:05,350 --> 00:34:06,087
No.

559
00:34:06,817 --> 00:34:07,889
Never done that before.

560
00:34:08,999 --> 00:34:10,487
That's not what I meant.

561
00:34:12,179 --> 00:34:16,223
When I was 18, I fell madly in love
with a girl

562
00:34:16,223 --> 00:34:18,429
in my first year in college.

563
00:34:19,614 --> 00:34:21,926
We spent a few wonderful months together.

564
00:34:22,741 --> 00:34:25,031
I never knew I could feel so

565
00:34:25,531 --> 00:34:26,939
complete...

566
00:34:27,581 --> 00:34:29,153
so alive...

567
00:34:29,836 --> 00:34:31,785
Till now, obviously.

568
00:34:32,487 --> 00:34:33,951
Till now...

569
00:34:35,433 --> 00:34:37,065
So, what happened?

570
00:34:37,658 --> 00:34:39,696
I broke it off. I was in pieces.

571
00:34:39,696 --> 00:34:42,135
I told myself that it was for the best.

572
00:34:42,135 --> 00:34:44,348
That I was away from home and
I was lonely and...

573
00:34:45,673 --> 00:34:48,578
And now?

574
00:34:51,361 --> 00:34:53,519
This is not a way to live, Leyla.

575
00:34:54,867 --> 00:34:56,206
It's not easy.

576
00:34:56,206 --> 00:34:57,831
It's not acceptable.

577
00:34:58,601 --> 00:35:00,953
We didn't break any rules last night, Tala.

578
00:35:00,953 --> 00:35:04,240
Yeah, but we did where I come from. Ok?

579
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:05,717
Nobody lives like this.

580
00:35:06,163 --> 00:35:07,648
At least not openly.

581
00:35:07,895 --> 00:35:09,946
And you live in the West now.

582
00:35:11,106 --> 00:35:14,624
Yeah, but I don't think it's acceptable
to cheat on you fiancé

583
00:35:14,837 --> 00:35:17,143
anywhere in the world.

584
00:36:00,831 --> 00:36:02,986
What do you like most about this place?

585
00:36:04,678 --> 00:36:07,033
The worlds that once existed.

586
00:36:07,575 --> 00:36:10,693
Just, the scent of antiquity.

587
00:36:11,066 --> 00:36:13,106
Ah, smells like mould in here.

588
00:36:14,883 --> 00:36:17,288
I don't care what anyone says, Lamia.

589
00:36:17,618 --> 00:36:19,529
You have a romantic soul.

590
00:36:25,069 --> 00:36:26,929
Hello, mama. Can you hear me?

591
00:36:27,809 --> 00:36:28,707
Stop the drier.

592
00:36:29,567 --> 00:36:31,068
Hello, Lamia.
Mama.

593
00:36:32,152 --> 00:36:33,430
Your tea, madam.

594
00:36:33,430 --> 00:36:35,773
This place is a complete dump.

595
00:36:36,019 --> 00:36:36,887
Give it to Philippe.

596
00:36:37,141 --> 00:36:38,550
Only museums and no shops.

597
00:36:38,550 --> 00:36:40,595
They don't even have a Gucci.

598
00:36:40,939 --> 00:36:42,561
Did you get her something colourful?

599
00:36:42,561 --> 00:36:44,043
Tala thinks grey is a colour.

600
00:36:44,043 --> 00:36:45,786
And they got bored of shopping.

601
00:36:45,786 --> 00:36:47,054
They?

602
00:36:47,054 --> 00:36:48,495
Her friend is here with her.

603
00:36:48,851 --> 00:36:50,502
Leyla?

604
00:36:50,912 --> 00:36:52,555
The indian jewess?

605
00:36:52,555 --> 00:36:53,431
The indian.

606
00:36:54,070 --> 00:36:55,502
I didn't know that she was jewish.

607
00:36:56,901 --> 00:36:58,497
They're spending all their time together...

608
00:36:58,497 --> 00:37:01,483
I guess it's nice for Tala to
have such a close friend.

609
00:37:01,483 --> 00:37:03,640
Good thing she's coming back next week.

610
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:05,686
That's the other thing.

611
00:37:05,686 --> 00:37:08,921
I think she wants to stay in London a while longer.

612
00:37:08,921 --> 00:37:10,850
She did this with the second engagement.

613
00:37:10,850 --> 00:37:12,912
Or was it the first?

614
00:37:12,912 --> 00:37:14,858
And she never came back for the wedding.

615
00:37:14,858 --> 00:37:17,726
I'm sure it's not exactly like that.

616
00:37:17,726 --> 00:37:18,602
Mama?

617
00:37:18,602 --> 00:37:20,535
Mama?

618
00:37:37,910 --> 00:37:38,996
Home, sweet home.

619
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:51,372
Hello. Mama!

620
00:37:54,310 --> 00:37:55,669
Hello, my love.

621
00:37:55,723 --> 00:37:57,423
Hani.
Did you enjoy your trip?

622
00:37:57,827 --> 00:37:58,913
Yes.

623
00:37:58,913 --> 00:38:00,464
I'd give anything to be with you now.

624
00:38:00,691 --> 00:38:04,717
Sit down. Sit down. 
I have a surprise for Tala.

625
00:38:04,998 --> 00:38:06,287
I'd like you to see it.

626
00:38:06,287 --> 00:38:09,627
How was your trip?
Fine, I just walked in.

627
00:38:09,627 --> 00:38:12,134
I know.
How do you know?

628
00:38:12,359 --> 00:38:13,966
I can see you.

629
00:38:13,966 --> 00:38:14,815
What do you mean?

630
00:38:14,815 --> 00:38:16,361
Where are you?

631
00:38:17,432 --> 00:38:20,996
Right here. Sweetheart...

632
00:38:28,488 --> 00:38:30,120
They're so in love...

633
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:32,200
it brings tears to my eyes.

634
00:38:32,991 --> 00:38:34,849
And you must be Leyla.

635
00:38:37,230 --> 00:38:39,001
It's such a pleasure to meet you.

636
00:38:39,844 --> 00:38:41,440
Tala's talked about you a lot.

637
00:38:41,831 --> 00:38:43,153
You too.

638
00:38:44,445 --> 00:38:46,316
How was Oxford?

639
00:38:46,316 --> 00:38:49,656
Lovely, much more than I'd expected.

640
00:38:51,067 --> 00:38:54,255
You know, no one ever says how 
romantic Oxford is,

641
00:38:54,519 --> 00:38:57,706
the river, its buildings, the history...

642
00:38:58,635 --> 00:39:00,996
Well, let's have dinner.

643
00:39:01,444 --> 00:39:04,159
You girls must be hungry.

644
00:39:04,524 --> 00:39:06,065
I have to go but thank you.

645
00:39:06,065 --> 00:39:07,759
Oh no, I won't hear of it.

646
00:39:07,759 --> 00:39:09,311
A quick bite.

647
00:39:10,877 --> 00:39:13,670
Hani works in the Jordanian gorvernment, you know?

648
00:39:13,670 --> 00:39:15,235
The foreign office.

649
00:39:15,653 --> 00:39:17,279
Does that cover relations with Israel?

650
00:39:17,279 --> 00:39:18,418
Yes.

651
00:39:18,418 --> 00:39:19,365
How can you stand it?

652
00:39:19,365 --> 00:39:21,057
We have to stand it.

653
00:39:21,057 --> 00:39:23,872
And sometimes even learn something from the israelies.

654
00:39:23,872 --> 00:39:25,019
What do you want to learn?

655
00:39:25,019 --> 00:39:26,931
How to shoot children?

656
00:39:26,931 --> 00:39:28,132
Obviously, not that.

657
00:39:28,575 --> 00:39:30,660
But Israel is the closest thing to
a democracy

658
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:32,384
that we have in the Middle East.

659
00:39:32,384 --> 00:39:35,924
Oh, thank god I didn't send your
sisters to that american school.

660
00:39:36,252 --> 00:39:38,222
They turned you into an arab-hater.

661
00:39:38,222 --> 00:39:38,935
Auntie...

662
00:39:38,935 --> 00:39:41,439
your daughter is one of the proudest
palestinians I know.

663
00:39:41,652 --> 00:39:43,778
Why don't you show Leyla and Tala the invitations?

664
00:39:44,109 --> 00:39:45,198
What invitations?

665
00:39:45,198 --> 00:39:46,560
To our wedding.

666
00:39:51,795 --> 00:39:52,776
Well?

667
00:39:52,776 --> 00:39:54,594
It's beautiful.

668
00:39:55,011 --> 00:39:56,398
Really perfect.

669
00:40:00,371 --> 00:40:01,992
Are you alright?

670
00:40:02,839 --> 00:40:04,799
Just a headache.

671
00:40:04,799 --> 00:40:06,649
Here.

672
00:40:07,369 --> 00:40:09,041
I just need to use the bathroom.

673
00:40:09,041 --> 00:40:11,155
Upstairs. Ninth door on the left.

674
00:40:11,367 --> 00:40:12,608
Thank you.

675
00:40:12,608 --> 00:40:14,443
Do you want me to go with you?

676
00:40:14,443 --> 00:40:16,177
No, I'm fine.

677
00:40:49,667 --> 00:40:50,668
What are you doing?

678
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,824
Holding your hand.

679
00:40:52,824 --> 00:40:54,025
So what happens?

680
00:40:54,305 --> 00:40:56,407
We get five minutes of hand-holding.

681
00:40:56,663 --> 00:40:59,045
I get a night in Oxford and he
gets a night in London.

682
00:40:59,045 --> 00:41:00,168
That's not fair.

683
00:41:00,168 --> 00:41:02,189
What is fair Tala?

684
00:41:02,949 --> 00:41:04,731
We can't live like this.

685
00:41:05,798 --> 00:41:07,612
Our families won't understand.

686
00:41:07,612 --> 00:41:09,693
I can't lead you into a life that's...

687
00:41:09,693 --> 00:41:11,050
difficult.

688
00:41:11,050 --> 00:41:13,316
I don't need your protection.

689
00:41:13,753 --> 00:41:17,338
Thanks to you I know what I want and

690
00:41:17,338 --> 00:41:19,214
I can't go back.

691
00:41:20,004 --> 00:41:22,899
I want to feel the way I felt last night every day.

692
00:41:23,302 --> 00:41:24,990
I want to be with someone that

693
00:41:25,246 --> 00:41:27,407
ten years from now makes my heart jump

694
00:41:27,407 --> 00:41:29,346
when I hear her key in the door.

695
00:41:30,310 --> 00:41:32,433
And that someone is you.

696
00:41:35,306 --> 00:41:36,961
I...

697
00:41:37,444 --> 00:41:39,192
I can't hurt Hani.

698
00:41:40,322 --> 00:41:41,948
Are you in love with him?

699
00:41:44,112 --> 00:41:47,829
There are things I love about him.

700
00:41:48,629 --> 00:41:50,846
I can't ruin lives.

701
00:41:51,233 --> 00:41:52,614
You will.

702
00:41:52,614 --> 00:41:54,964
Especially yours.

703
00:41:56,662 --> 00:41:59,111
Tala, are you OK?

704
00:42:00,625 --> 00:42:03,008
Tell me you can do this.

705
00:42:13,637 --> 00:42:15,151
Tala...

706
00:43:19,912 --> 00:43:22,978
Ramzi, welcome!
Hello.

707
00:44:02,035 --> 00:44:03,666
Christ... I'm still here.

708
00:44:30,508 --> 00:44:33,434
No two women should look this
beautiful at six in the morning.

709
00:44:34,489 --> 00:44:36,239
Is the king coming for breakfast?

710
00:44:36,239 --> 00:44:38,423
No, I'm going to the airport.

711
00:44:38,423 --> 00:44:40,689
Sami's flying in from New York for the wedding.

712
00:44:40,689 --> 00:44:42,326
I haven't seen your brother in years.

713
00:44:42,587 --> 00:44:44,118
Does he still like musicals?

714
00:44:44,118 --> 00:44:45,645
I don't know.

715
00:44:45,645 --> 00:44:48,216
But I'm sure he's looking very
much forward to seeing you.

716
00:44:48,216 --> 00:44:49,791
Why?

717
00:44:49,791 --> 00:44:51,883
We'll be back in time for breakfast
with your parents.

718
00:44:54,609 --> 00:44:57,425
Wasn't he supposed to get a place
for Lamia, like four years ago?

719
00:44:57,894 --> 00:44:59,514
Would you leave a suite at the best hotel
in town

720
00:44:59,514 --> 00:45:01,105
if you were getting it for free?

721
00:45:01,105 --> 00:45:03,183
I'd leave paradise itself if mama was there.

722
00:45:03,550 --> 00:45:06,335
Well, Kareem would brave hell itself
to secure his enheritance.

723
00:45:06,909 --> 00:45:08,050
He's not their son.

724
00:45:08,050 --> 00:45:11,417
But in the absence of a son he
is the perfect son-in-law.

725
00:45:12,078 --> 00:45:13,862
Which David could never be.

726
00:45:14,849 --> 00:45:16,383
Anyway, he broke up with me.

727
00:45:16,629 --> 00:45:19,119
He did? I'm sorry, sweetheart.

728
00:45:20,233 --> 00:45:22,064
He wants to bring up his kids as jews.

729
00:45:23,146 --> 00:45:25,245
Hanukkah... Pass-over...

730
00:45:25,623 --> 00:45:27,213
Imagine mama's face...

731
00:45:27,531 --> 00:45:28,874
I'd really rather not...

732
00:45:28,874 --> 00:45:30,360
though it might be worth it.

733
00:45:31,092 --> 00:45:33,828
We thought we could start our own mini peace process.

734
00:45:34,942 --> 00:45:37,038
He never made a secret of being
attached to his culture.

735
00:45:37,038 --> 00:45:38,906
Then why did he even get involved with you?

736
00:45:38,906 --> 00:45:42,220
I mean, what kind of a person
allows you to

737
00:45:42,467 --> 00:45:43,400
get emotionally entangled

738
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:45,206
when they know there's no way forward?

739
00:45:46,366 --> 00:45:47,094
I need a coffee.

740
00:45:47,094 --> 00:45:48,913
No. No...

741
00:45:49,185 --> 00:45:51,331
You need to stop selling
yourself short.

742
00:45:51,626 --> 00:45:53,868
Sometimes... sometimes..

743
00:45:54,085 --> 00:45:57,358
you can't stop and rationalize
everything so perfectly.

744
00:45:57,358 --> 00:45:59,251
Don't you ever just do something...

745
00:45:59,251 --> 00:46:02,897
Even when you know deep down
it's going to be a disaster?

746
00:46:11,537 --> 00:46:13,164
You will like Zina, if you give her a chance.

747
00:46:13,164 --> 00:46:14,229
She's a nice girl.

748
00:46:14,229 --> 00:46:16,746
And she wears a lot of black also.

749
00:46:16,746 --> 00:46:18,863
I think the two of you will match perfectly.

750
00:46:19,365 --> 00:46:21,920
I'm really not interested in women.

751
00:46:24,441 --> 00:46:27,192
Too busy working at the investment bank,
I imagine.

752
00:46:27,768 --> 00:46:30,130
I mean, you have to start thinking
about your future, Sami.

753
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:31,936
What? Like you?

754
00:46:32,357 --> 00:46:33,891
Yes.

755
00:46:34,151 --> 00:46:35,424
Like me.

756
00:46:38,387 --> 00:46:39,666
Welcome, Sami.

757
00:46:39,991 --> 00:46:40,664
Thank you.

758
00:46:40,664 --> 00:46:44,724
It's not very often that I have
all my daughters at home at the same time.

759
00:46:45,242 --> 00:46:46,747
I'd like to propose a toast.

760
00:46:48,081 --> 00:46:49,673
To Tala and Hani.

761
00:46:50,221 --> 00:46:52,306
To Tala and Hani.

762
00:46:53,526 --> 00:46:56,032
And may you have many daughters.

763
00:46:57,647 --> 00:46:58,866
Oh, papa!

764
00:47:01,683 --> 00:47:03,396
No thanks, I'm vegetarian.

765
00:47:03,396 --> 00:47:03,902
Really?

766
00:47:03,902 --> 00:47:05,481
Me too.

767
00:47:05,747 --> 00:47:07,955
Have you ever been to Dan's Bakery
in New York?

768
00:47:07,955 --> 00:47:08,496
In the village...

769
00:47:08,496 --> 00:47:09,725
I love that place.

770
00:47:09,725 --> 00:47:11,387
They make the best arabic bread.

771
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:14,159
And they have the best looking beagles.

772
00:47:14,589 --> 00:47:15,580
That's not important.

773
00:47:16,176 --> 00:47:17,463
Well, it is to me.

774
00:47:21,876 --> 00:47:23,271
Did anyone see?

775
00:47:23,271 --> 00:47:25,440
There was another suicide bomb last night.

776
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:28,635
It's barbaric the way they brainwash these people.

777
00:47:28,635 --> 00:47:30,521
This idea of a paradise waiting for you

778
00:47:30,521 --> 00:47:32,193
if you kill innocent people.

779
00:47:32,193 --> 00:47:33,908
They're not killing innocent people.

780
00:47:33,908 --> 00:47:35,684
They're killing israelies.

781
00:47:35,684 --> 00:47:37,938
Have you forgotten what they did to us at Sabra

782
00:47:37,938 --> 00:47:39,994
and Shatilla and Deir Yassin?

783
00:47:39,994 --> 00:47:42,243
So we sink to their level and kill children?

784
00:47:42,243 --> 00:47:44,606
Children who grow up to be israeli soldiers.

785
00:47:44,827 --> 00:47:46,019
Kareem, please...

786
00:47:46,019 --> 00:47:47,001
With all due respect Hani,

787
00:47:47,001 --> 00:47:50,026
but you and I have never suffered
like our palestinian countrymen.

788
00:47:50,026 --> 00:47:53,694
If I remember right you were busy the last time
we went to a refugee camp

789
00:47:53,694 --> 00:47:55,857
to interview people for jobs.

790
00:47:55,857 --> 00:47:59,395
I was holding the fort at the office
for your father that day.

791
00:47:59,679 --> 00:48:03,382
And Lamia and I went to the refugee charity
dinner just last month.

792
00:48:03,586 --> 00:48:05,906
Where the refugees wash the dishes.

793
00:48:07,679 --> 00:48:09,623
Will you all excuse me please, I've a...

794
00:48:10,499 --> 00:48:12,115
I've got a lot I have to do.

795
00:48:12,654 --> 00:48:14,609
The seamstress will be here at 10.

796
00:48:15,224 --> 00:48:17,585
Make sure you hold your stomach in this time.

797
00:49:04,347 --> 00:49:05,678
Are you trying to kill me,

798
00:49:05,678 --> 00:49:07,473
creeping into the house like a rober?

799
00:49:07,473 --> 00:49:08,886
Sorry.

800
00:49:09,548 --> 00:49:11,115
You missed "Bollywood Sisters".

801
00:49:11,115 --> 00:49:15,193
Nina's just found out her 16 years daughter
is pregnant and a drug addict.

802
00:49:15,665 --> 00:49:16,593
I made you some pasta.

803
00:49:16,593 --> 00:49:17,857
I need to talk to you.

804
00:49:17,857 --> 00:49:18,784
What's the matter?

805
00:49:18,784 --> 00:49:19,700
Are you sick?

806
00:49:19,700 --> 00:49:21,568
No, I'm fine.

807
00:49:21,568 --> 00:49:23,837
Actually very good.

808
00:49:24,321 --> 00:49:25,446
Happy.

809
00:49:27,199 --> 00:49:28,235
Where's dad?

810
00:49:28,235 --> 00:49:30,948
In town with a client. He'll be back
home soon.

811
00:49:31,285 --> 00:49:32,023
Ali called.

812
00:49:32,023 --> 00:49:34,296
Oh, shit, I forgot about him.

813
00:49:35,318 --> 00:49:37,088
Well, he's a wonderful boy.

814
00:49:38,641 --> 00:49:42,934
Mum, I'm not happy with him.

815
00:49:44,852 --> 00:49:47,523
Then auntie Gulshan's son is looking
for somebody.

816
00:49:47,523 --> 00:49:48,903
He's very succesful.

817
00:49:48,903 --> 00:49:49,924
He's a bookie.

818
00:49:49,924 --> 00:49:51,266
And handsome.

819
00:49:51,266 --> 00:49:53,388
He's 6 foot 7 all I can see is his navel.

820
00:49:53,388 --> 00:49:54,873
Well, then you'll have tall children.

821
00:49:54,847 --> 00:49:56,639
Mum, I can't be happy with him.

822
00:49:56,639 --> 00:49:59,331
The way I'm not happy with Ali...

823
00:49:59,787 --> 00:50:03,806
and I've always known why but...

824
00:50:04,144 --> 00:50:05,777
I was hoping that the reason

825
00:50:06,024 --> 00:50:07,948
I thought was the reason...

826
00:50:07,948 --> 00:50:09,951
might not really be the reason...

827
00:50:09,951 --> 00:50:11,199
and that things would change,

828
00:50:11,199 --> 00:50:14,059
but they never have, not really and now...

829
00:50:14,059 --> 00:50:17,646
I know for sure that what I've
been feeling all these years...

830
00:50:17,667 --> 00:50:19,211
Is actually the right thing.

831
00:50:19,211 --> 00:50:21,412
and there's nothing wrong with it...
-Do you want cheese with it?

832
00:50:21,412 --> 00:50:23,754
Mum, what I'm trying to say is...
I haven't got cheddar for pasta, parmesan though...

833
00:50:23,754 --> 00:50:25,766
I've got olive oil...
-Just listen to me, I'M GAY.

834
00:50:26,458 --> 00:50:27,798
I'm home.

835
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:31,835
What did I miss?

836
00:50:32,751 --> 00:50:34,203
I'm gay...

837
00:50:34,727 --> 00:50:36,377
But I've only been gone two hours...

838
00:50:36,377 --> 00:50:39,684
You always said you just wanted us to be happy.

839
00:50:39,937 --> 00:50:41,515
I lied.

840
00:50:44,533 --> 00:50:46,728
Who did this to you?

841
00:50:47,152 --> 00:50:49,420
I haven't caught a disease, mum,

842
00:50:49,420 --> 00:50:52,299
I'm just gay, like I have brown hair.

843
00:50:53,148 --> 00:50:55,120
First you stop coming to mosque,

844
00:50:55,325 --> 00:50:57,718
now, you're up to your neck in sin.

845
00:50:57,718 --> 00:50:59,014
It's not a sin!

846
00:50:59,014 --> 00:51:03,557
Mum, I haven't killed or stolen and I'm
trying not to lie to you.

847
00:51:03,557 --> 00:51:05,493
It's a huge sin!

848
00:51:05,493 --> 00:51:06,308
According to who?

849
00:51:06,308 --> 00:51:07,554
According to God!

850
00:51:07,554 --> 00:51:09,979
What kind of a God is that?
I don't accept it!

851
00:51:10,726 --> 00:51:13,114
Then you will burn in hell!

852
00:51:13,114 --> 00:51:15,153
That's enough!

853
00:51:17,917 --> 00:51:19,050
It's OK.

854
00:51:24,315 --> 00:51:28,046
I think maybe it's time we discuss getting
you that flat you've been asking for.

855
00:51:30,035 --> 00:51:32,528
If I could help it I would, but I can't...

856
00:51:32,988 --> 00:51:34,617
I know, Beta.

857
00:51:35,312 --> 00:51:36,300
I know.

858
00:51:42,297 --> 00:51:45,119
How many pre-wedding dinners is
it possible to have?

859
00:51:47,350 --> 00:51:49,903
And another thing, if the rule's
"no black", then fine...

860
00:51:49,903 --> 00:51:51,430
but how come you get a dress that's elegant

861
00:51:51,430 --> 00:51:53,281
and I get one that's liberaci?

862
00:51:53,489 --> 00:51:55,594
Because I did Tala's shopping for her in Paris.

863
00:51:56,104 --> 00:51:59,694
"Zina, don't wear black, it's not a funeral. Mama"

864
00:52:00,584 --> 00:52:03,367
It's a funeral for the 20 lambs that got
slaughtered for this dinner.

865
00:52:04,386 --> 00:52:07,097
They made tofu kebabs for you, sweetheart.

866
00:52:08,130 --> 00:52:10,796
Come on Zina. Sami's down stairs.

867
00:52:11,388 --> 00:52:12,810
He asked where you were.

868
00:52:12,854 --> 00:52:14,726
Send him this dress, he'd probably love it.

869
00:52:15,312 --> 00:52:17,198
What kind of a stupid comment is that?

870
00:52:17,906 --> 00:52:19,084
He likes you a lot, you know.

871
00:52:19,390 --> 00:52:20,881
Yeah, well, I like him too.

872
00:52:21,127 --> 00:52:22,327
You should go out with him.

873
00:52:22,327 --> 00:52:23,799
He's the right age to marry.

874
00:52:24,907 --> 00:52:26,317
You seem to have a lot in common.

875
00:52:26,317 --> 00:52:27,345
You both like New York,

876
00:52:27,345 --> 00:52:28,738
you both like black clothes...

877
00:52:28,738 --> 00:52:30,080
We both like men...

878
00:52:30,329 --> 00:52:31,726
Stop saying things like that.

879
00:52:32,666 --> 00:52:35,377
Yeah, if you don't say it Z, maybe it
won't be true.

880
00:52:36,555 --> 00:52:37,919
Kareem thinks it's a phase.

881
00:52:38,349 --> 00:52:40,198
If he meets the right girl
he'll get over it.

882
00:52:40,997 --> 00:52:43,387
That strategy sure didn't work for uncle Ramzi.

883
00:52:43,946 --> 00:52:45,625
Uncle Ramzi is not gay.

884
00:52:47,036 --> 00:52:48,703
Yeah, and the pope ain't catholic.

885
00:52:49,494 --> 00:52:50,641
What do you think, Lamia?

886
00:52:50,631 --> 00:52:51,795
Do you think that...

887
00:52:53,158 --> 00:52:54,900
Do you think that being gay is a "phase"?

888
00:52:56,219 --> 00:52:58,688
Do you thinks it's alright to sacrifice
your own sister to...

889
00:52:58,688 --> 00:53:01,426
to a life of misery-marriage into
someone who's gay?

890
00:53:02,329 --> 00:53:04,052
No matter how well their clothes match?

891
00:53:04,052 --> 00:53:07,072
Well, I guess you would know more about
that than anyone else.

892
00:53:13,820 --> 00:53:15,045
What's her problem?

893
00:53:37,750 --> 00:53:40,649
I have a strange sense of "deja-vu".

894
00:53:45,355 --> 00:53:46,790
I'm sorry, papa.

895
00:53:49,534 --> 00:53:50,926
Have you told Hani?

896
00:53:55,380 --> 00:53:56,979
I don't know what to tell him.

897
00:54:01,240 --> 00:54:04,491
Except that I know it won't be fair to him
to go through with the wedding.

898
00:54:14,573 --> 00:54:16,759
You know what fathers want for their daughters?

899
00:54:17,171 --> 00:54:19,050
For them to be happy.

900
00:54:19,050 --> 00:54:21,035
Son's move on, they have choices.

901
00:54:21,035 --> 00:54:22,638
Especially here, in the Middle East.

902
00:54:22,638 --> 00:54:24,611
But a daughter...

903
00:54:24,611 --> 00:54:26,699
a daughter needs a hand now and then.

904
00:54:33,797 --> 00:54:35,550
What are you gonna do about this?

905
00:54:37,284 --> 00:54:39,199
Oh, I don't know...

906
00:54:39,547 --> 00:54:41,004
Maybe we can just have the party.

907
00:54:41,004 --> 00:54:44,186
Your uncle Ramzi can tell his plane crash stories.

908
00:54:44,186 --> 00:54:47,277
And everyone in town can toast to
new scandal with champagne.

909
00:54:48,838 --> 00:54:50,382
See Hani.

910
00:54:50,911 --> 00:54:53,483
Go and get dressed. It'll be OK.

911
00:55:06,162 --> 00:55:06,836
Ravi.

912
00:55:06,836 --> 00:55:07,476
Sir?

913
00:55:07,476 --> 00:55:10,088
Pack all the wedding food and send
it to the camps.

914
00:55:14,056 --> 00:55:16,810
They should have cancelation insurance
for weddings...

915
00:55:17,592 --> 00:55:19,267
That stuff would sell itself.

916
00:56:36,875 --> 00:56:38,230
Can I have the keys, dad?

917
00:56:38,726 --> 00:56:40,183
"I can't think straight"

918
00:56:40,183 --> 00:56:41,351
She won't get it.

919
00:56:41,351 --> 00:56:42,369
Get what?

920
00:56:42,635 --> 00:56:43,311
Nothing.

921
00:56:44,571 --> 00:56:46,387
Where are you going?

922
00:56:47,050 --> 00:56:49,017
I'm having Leyla look for flats.

923
00:56:52,837 --> 00:56:54,295
She doesn't have to go.

924
00:56:58,882 --> 00:57:00,299
She needs to.

925
00:57:08,493 --> 00:57:09,566
What exactly happened?

926
00:57:09,566 --> 00:57:11,077
I broke Hani's heart.

927
00:57:12,128 --> 00:57:15,186
Hey, Tala. You have to give yourself a break.

928
00:57:15,527 --> 00:57:16,739
If you knew he wasn't the right one

929
00:57:16,739 --> 00:57:18,633
then you did exactly the right thing.

930
00:57:19,413 --> 00:57:21,211
Yeah, except I should've told him sooner.

931
00:57:22,426 --> 00:57:23,904
Look, honey, we all wish we had far-sight..

932
00:57:27,005 --> 00:57:28,499
So what about you, huh?

933
00:57:30,019 --> 00:57:31,968
Me? YFS...

934
00:57:32,403 --> 00:57:34,195
Young, free and single...

935
00:57:35,118 --> 00:57:36,365
You're not seeing Leyla?

936
00:57:36,613 --> 00:57:38,519
Neah, she dumped me.

937
00:57:39,585 --> 00:57:40,863
What happened?

938
00:57:41,155 --> 00:57:43,847
Well, on the plus side it wasn't really my fault

939
00:57:44,792 --> 00:57:46,133
She told me she's gay.

940
00:57:49,256 --> 00:57:50,982
I know, I was shocked too.

941
00:57:53,425 --> 00:57:55,238
You know, she even told her parents.

942
00:57:55,954 --> 00:57:57,544
You're kidding.
-No.

943
00:57:58,115 --> 00:57:59,789
Got to admire her guts.

944
00:58:00,923 --> 00:58:02,782
She's always had a fierce treat that one.

945
00:58:03,219 --> 00:58:06,477
You know, there aren't many people in
our community that'd be willing to do that.

946
00:58:08,251 --> 00:58:10,021
Always liked that about her.

947
00:58:13,267 --> 00:58:14,919
Come on, you.

948
00:58:35,656 --> 00:58:36,774
Hello?

949
00:58:37,324 --> 00:58:39,466
Hello. This is Tala speaking.

950
00:58:39,466 --> 00:58:40,816
Can I speak to Leyla?

951
00:58:41,255 --> 00:58:42,312
Ah, yeah. One minute.

952
00:58:42,832 --> 00:58:43,944
For you.

953
00:58:43,944 --> 00:58:45,239
Who is it?

954
00:58:45,239 --> 00:58:46,337
Tala.

955
00:58:46,831 --> 00:58:48,252
I'm not talking to her...

956
00:58:51,710 --> 00:58:52,681
Yasmine...

957
00:58:53,491 --> 00:58:55,895
Yasmine... I'm not talking to her.

958
00:58:55,895 --> 00:58:57,073
Take the phone.

959
00:59:00,030 --> 00:59:02,341
She can't come to the phone right now.

960
00:59:03,033 --> 00:59:04,480
No, I'll...

961
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:06,655
I'll call back tomorrow...

962
00:59:28,845 --> 00:59:32,108
Perhaps one of the most stunning
archeological finds of that century...

963
00:59:32,364 --> 00:59:33,666
indeed, any century,

964
00:59:34,099 --> 00:59:37,867
was the founding in the south of
Jordan of the  Lost City of Petra.

965
00:59:38,562 --> 00:59:42,256
Dramatically carved out of froze
coloured stone by the nabatheans,

966
00:59:42,256 --> 00:59:46,210
the massive columns of the temple
rise up to surprise visitors

967
00:59:46,210 --> 00:59:49,808
as they walk through a high cannion
to reach the entrance.

968
00:59:50,131 --> 00:59:51,744
A breathtaking sight,

969
00:59:52,356 --> 00:59:54,392
now, a thriving turist destination,

970
00:59:54,688 --> 00:59:58,925
Petra has enthralled generations of
archeologists and visitors alike,

971
00:59:58,925 --> 01:00:01,671
thanks to the stories and beauty of
its lost city.

972
01:00:02,242 --> 01:00:04,995
Like the rest of Jordan, it is well
worth a visit.

973
01:00:08,912 --> 01:00:10,031
She's good.

974
01:00:15,918 --> 01:00:18,199
Hello.
-Naturally, it's much...

975
01:00:18,199 --> 01:00:19,918
Oh, it was so great to go...

976
01:00:21,336 --> 01:00:24,402
Apparently, you can only get into Petra
on a horse or a hump.

977
01:00:24,402 --> 01:00:26,145
That would be a great laugh.
It'd be fun.

978
01:00:28,764 --> 01:00:30,176
What are you doing here?

979
01:00:30,176 --> 01:00:32,454
My family sponsored the lecture.

980
01:00:32,735 --> 01:00:34,381
What are you doing here?

981
01:00:34,381 --> 01:00:36,504
I'm interested in Jordan.

982
01:00:36,798 --> 01:00:38,392
It has a population of 5 million

983
01:00:38,923 --> 01:00:41,277
and no natural resources to speak about.

984
01:00:41,736 --> 01:00:44,398
Petra's lovely but there isn't much
to say about Jordan...

985
01:00:44,398 --> 01:00:47,197
because it's me you're interested in.

986
01:00:50,723 --> 01:00:52,205
How's your wedding?

987
01:00:52,205 --> 01:00:54,243
Leyla, let's go.

988
01:00:54,657 --> 01:00:56,668
This is my friend Jennifer.

989
01:00:56,668 --> 01:00:57,915
Your friend?

990
01:00:57,915 --> 01:00:59,840
Her girlfriend.

991
01:01:03,237 --> 01:01:04,236
Girlfriend...

992
01:01:05,836 --> 01:01:06,586
Who's that?

993
01:01:06,586 --> 01:01:09,753
That's my friend Tala, her family...

994
01:01:23,518 --> 01:01:25,028
D'you want that?

995
01:01:27,326 --> 01:01:29,437
D'you wanna join us for a drink tonight?

996
01:01:29,858 --> 01:01:31,464
I can't, I have to work.

997
01:01:31,464 --> 01:01:33,116
Yeah, how's that going?

998
01:01:33,670 --> 01:01:34,780
I got the order.

999
01:01:34,780 --> 01:01:36,711
That's fantastic, Tala.

1000
01:01:36,711 --> 01:01:39,628
Great! D'you know how difficult it is
to get into those big chains.

1001
01:01:40,199 --> 01:01:41,850
Thought that's exactly what you wanted?

1002
01:01:42,290 --> 01:01:43,916
Yeah, it was.

1003
01:01:44,320 --> 01:01:45,714
Well, we should celebrate.

1004
01:01:45,714 --> 01:01:47,316
It'll be fun.

1005
01:01:47,316 --> 01:01:49,446
Leyla said she might join us tonight.

1006
01:01:52,797 --> 01:01:55,861
No, I'm... I'm really busy.

1007
01:01:57,230 --> 01:01:58,759
Is everything OK?

1008
01:02:01,307 --> 01:02:03,128
I don't get it.

1009
01:02:03,128 --> 01:02:04,531
Which part?

1010
01:02:05,207 --> 01:02:07,180
Why d'you wanna get Leyla and Tala together?

1011
01:02:07,513 --> 01:02:09,736
I mean, the other day Tala didn't
seem interested at all.

1012
01:02:09,997 --> 01:02:12,450
Listen. Did you ever watch the TV show
"The L Word"?

1013
01:02:12,450 --> 01:02:15,034
No... But did you ever consider not
talking in riddles?

1014
01:02:15,581 --> 01:02:17,137
They're in love with each other.

1015
01:02:17,137 --> 01:02:18,589
Who?

1016
01:02:18,589 --> 01:02:20,325
Sonny and Cher...

1017
01:02:20,779 --> 01:02:22,200
Leyla and Tala.

1018
01:02:23,878 --> 01:02:25,692
Leyla and Tala?

1019
01:02:32,036 --> 01:02:33,270
Good evening, madam.
Good evening.

1020
01:02:33,270 --> 01:02:34,687
I'm meeting Ali.

1021
01:02:36,187 --> 01:02:37,661
The other party hasn't arrived yet.

1022
01:02:37,661 --> 01:02:38,919
Would you like to take a seat at the bar

1023
01:02:38,919 --> 01:02:40,839
or would you like me to show you
to your table?

1024
01:02:41,362 --> 01:02:42,815
The table.
-Sure.

1025
01:02:52,228 --> 01:02:52,914
Oh, good evening.

1026
01:02:52,914 --> 01:02:54,994
Reservation for Ali, 7:30.

1027
01:02:54,994 --> 01:02:56,650
Oh, yes, follow me.

1028
01:03:00,569 --> 01:03:01,632
There you go, madam.

1029
01:03:06,222 --> 01:03:07,163
Thank you.

1030
01:03:12,538 --> 01:03:14,510
The gentleman sends his regrets, ladies.

1031
01:03:14,510 --> 01:03:15,629
He's unable to make it.

1032
01:03:15,629 --> 01:03:18,120
But he does wish you a pleasant
evening at his invitation.

1033
01:03:18,120 --> 01:03:19,330
Thank you.

1034
01:03:21,545 --> 01:03:22,928
We've been set up.

1035
01:03:22,928 --> 01:03:24,254
So it seems.

1036
01:03:27,753 --> 01:03:29,423
You look wonderful.

1037
01:03:29,797 --> 01:03:31,179
So do you.

1038
01:03:31,880 --> 01:03:33,101
I know.

1039
01:03:33,984 --> 01:03:35,235
I'm just joking.

1040
01:03:40,857 --> 01:03:42,192
How's your husband?

1041
01:03:42,192 --> 01:03:43,862
I don't have one.

1042
01:03:48,384 --> 01:03:49,969
I broke off the wedding...

1043
01:03:50,428 --> 01:03:52,641
the morning of the wedding...

1044
01:03:53,701 --> 01:03:55,709
That must've been very difficult.

1045
01:03:56,340 --> 01:03:59,329
It was the second hardest thing
I've ever had to do.

1046
01:04:01,176 --> 01:04:03,436
What was the first?

1047
01:04:05,764 --> 01:04:09,283
Leaving you to go back to Jordan.

1048
01:04:24,755 --> 01:04:26,944
Well now, I'm glad to see you
were discreet.

1049
01:04:31,039 --> 01:04:32,826
Well? How did it go?

1050
01:04:33,169 --> 01:04:34,795
Their eyes met.

1051
01:04:34,795 --> 01:04:37,206
A brief smile played across Tala's mouth,

1052
01:04:37,587 --> 01:04:40,035
unconsciously Leyla licked her lips.

1053
01:04:41,615 --> 01:04:42,636
It's all over.

1054
01:04:42,636 --> 01:04:45,432
OK. I'm still getting used to the idea.

1055
01:04:45,770 --> 01:04:48,016
You sound just like my dad when
you say things like that.

1056
01:04:48,629 --> 01:04:49,574
You know what?

1057
01:04:49,574 --> 01:04:51,317
I've always liked your dad.

1058
01:04:55,120 --> 01:04:57,707
What about you? How are you?

1059
01:04:58,049 --> 01:04:59,518
Fine.

1060
01:04:59,811 --> 01:05:00,591
Really good.

1061
01:05:00,591 --> 01:05:02,275
My book got published.

1062
01:05:02,484 --> 01:05:03,751
Really?

1063
01:05:03,751 --> 01:05:05,661
I mean... it will.

1064
01:05:05,661 --> 01:05:07,299
Next week, actually.

1065
01:05:07,659 --> 01:05:09,876
That is so wonderful, Leyla.

1066
01:05:09,876 --> 01:05:11,930
No one deserves it more than you.

1067
01:05:18,286 --> 01:05:19,805
How's your girlfriend?

1068
01:05:19,805 --> 01:05:21,094
Jennifer?

1069
01:05:21,094 --> 01:05:23,639
Has it been more than one?

1070
01:05:26,067 --> 01:05:27,448
No.

1071
01:05:28,505 --> 01:05:30,094
She's fine. Thank's for asking.

1072
01:05:31,257 --> 01:05:32,819
Do you love her?

1073
01:05:35,349 --> 01:05:37,614
There are things I love about her.

1074
01:05:39,284 --> 01:05:41,604
And is that good enough for you?

1075
01:05:43,753 --> 01:05:46,678
No, not really.

1076
01:05:50,356 --> 01:05:52,882
Did you tell your parents why you
broke off your wedding?

1077
01:05:54,374 --> 01:05:56,353
I told them it wouldn't be fair to Hani.

1078
01:05:56,353 --> 01:05:58,533
Did you tell them why?

1079
01:06:00,957 --> 01:06:02,170
Look, Leyla, you...

1080
01:06:02,170 --> 01:06:04,032
you don't understand.

1081
01:06:04,032 --> 01:06:07,346
Jordan.. it's an unforgiving place.

1082
01:06:08,685 --> 01:06:10,997
My parents have a strong place in
that society and...

1083
01:06:10,997 --> 01:06:12,525
it's a culture that doesn't change.

1084
01:06:12,525 --> 01:06:15,877
And I guess as long as people don't
dare to be truthful about who they are..

1085
01:06:15,877 --> 01:06:17,001
it never will change.

1086
01:06:17,001 --> 01:06:19,138
Leyla, I love you.

1087
01:06:19,138 --> 01:06:20,860
It's that simple.

1088
01:06:20,860 --> 01:06:23,237
Why should it be anyone else's business,
even my family's?

1089
01:06:23,237 --> 01:06:25,067
We make it their business every time
we have to lie about

1090
01:06:25,067 --> 01:06:26,959
who we're with and why we're with them.

1091
01:06:28,271 --> 01:06:29,917
You know, you once told me

1092
01:06:29,917 --> 01:06:33,030
to be more at ease with myself.

1093
01:06:33,030 --> 01:06:35,280
Thanks to you, I am.

1094
01:06:39,552 --> 01:06:41,380
I'm telling you the same thing.

1095
01:07:34,119 --> 01:07:36,147
"Every night I empty my heart,

1096
01:07:36,455 --> 01:07:38,496
but by morning it's full again.

1097
01:07:38,814 --> 01:07:42,715
Slow droplets of you sip in through
the night, soft caress...

1098
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,344
At dawn I overflow with thoughts of us

1099
01:07:45,344 --> 01:07:48,351
and aching pleasure that gives me no respite

1100
01:07:49,469 --> 01:07:50,880
Love cannot be contained,

1101
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:53,726
the neat packaging of desire splits us under

1102
01:07:54,796 --> 01:07:56,878
spilling crimson through my days.

1103
01:07:58,894 --> 01:08:02,380
Long, languishing days set are now
bruised tender with yearning

1104
01:08:03,227 --> 01:08:05,040
spent searching for a fingerprint,

1105
01:08:05,040 --> 01:08:08,654
a scent, a breath you left behind..."

1106
01:08:17,335 --> 01:08:18,877
Rani, where's my parents?

1107
01:08:18,877 --> 01:08:20,726
They've just finished lunch, miss.

1108
01:08:20,726 --> 01:08:22,421
I gave madam some mint tea.

1109
01:08:23,693 --> 01:08:24,917
Go in.

1110
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:32,015
Maybe I should try something american made.

1111
01:08:32,015 --> 01:08:35,359
As long as it's a third world country,
I don't mind where it is.

1112
01:08:35,949 --> 01:08:38,216
They work hard. They don't even think about...

1113
01:08:38,216 --> 01:08:41,273
Mama, papa, I have something I need to tell you.

1114
01:08:51,880 --> 01:08:54,240
What are you talking about?
You're a disgrace.

1115
01:08:56,727 --> 01:08:59,173
Haven't you shamed us enough already?

1116
01:09:00,708 --> 01:09:02,563
Please, Reema...

1117
01:09:04,204 --> 01:09:05,278
Tala...

1118
01:09:06,608 --> 01:09:07,896
Tala, wait.

1119
01:09:34,846 --> 01:09:36,938
"The sun hit her hand with a red hot force

1120
01:09:37,206 --> 01:09:39,899
that burned straight through the
clear-veined skin of her wrist.

1121
01:09:40,196 --> 01:09:42,814
And when she shut her eyes tightly
and briefly against it...

1122
01:09:43,216 --> 01:09:45,985
the heat still glowed under eyelids like coals"

1123
01:09:51,439 --> 01:09:53,887
Thank you, Leyla, for a very
illuminating talk and reading.

1124
01:09:54,293 --> 01:09:55,715
If anyone would like a signed copy...

1125
01:09:55,715 --> 01:09:57,756
Lyela has kindly agreed to do a signing.

1126
01:10:02,590 --> 01:10:03,360
I really loved it.

1127
01:10:03,360 --> 01:10:04,666
Especially the ending.

1128
01:10:04,666 --> 01:10:05,476
That's nice to hear.

1129
01:10:05,476 --> 01:10:07,427
Most people just love it when it ends.

1130
01:10:08,469 --> 01:10:09,496
Thank you.

1131
01:10:10,076 --> 01:10:11,511
Hi, Amina please.

1132
01:10:11,511 --> 01:10:14,190
Amina... quite an unique name.

1133
01:10:14,190 --> 01:10:15,135
Thank you.

1134
01:10:16,745 --> 01:10:17,970
Thank you very much.
Thank you.

1135
01:10:19,982 --> 01:10:21,267
Who should I make it out to?

1136
01:10:21,824 --> 01:10:22,961
To Tala...

1137
01:10:25,359 --> 01:10:28,363
who finally had the courage
to come out to her parents.

1138
01:10:42,177 --> 01:10:43,500
Thank you...

1139
01:11:00,356 --> 01:11:01,947
What did you tell them?

1140
01:11:03,120 --> 01:11:05,458
I told them I was in love...

1141
01:11:05,889 --> 01:11:06,974
with a beautiful...

1142
01:11:07,578 --> 01:11:08,863
intelligent...

1143
01:11:11,037 --> 01:11:12,511
talented...

1144
01:11:13,447 --> 01:11:14,731
clumsy...

1145
01:11:15,402 --> 01:11:16,694
woman.

1146
01:12:27,137 --> 01:12:29,428
Sorry we had to go to a hotel last night.

1147
01:12:30,914 --> 01:12:32,800
We won't from next week.

1148
01:12:33,042 --> 01:12:34,688
I'm getting my own place.

1149
01:12:37,258 --> 01:12:38,780
Congratulations. Is it a flat?

1150
01:12:38,780 --> 01:12:40,111
One bedroom.

1151
01:12:41,479 --> 01:12:42,959
What is it?

1152
01:12:44,094 --> 01:12:45,803
I was just thinking.

1153
01:12:46,864 --> 01:12:48,564
You're gonna need a bigger place.

1154
01:12:49,123 --> 01:12:50,170
Why?

1155
01:12:51,618 --> 01:12:52,810
Because...

1156
01:12:53,024 --> 01:12:54,778
I told my parents we're
gonna have children...

1157
01:12:55,612 --> 01:12:57,388
One day... Soon...

1158
01:12:57,597 --> 01:12:58,947
Children?

1159
01:12:59,790 --> 01:13:01,199
Soon.

1160
01:13:38,852 --> 01:13:40,225
She's what?

1161
01:13:40,785 --> 01:13:43,034
But some of my best friends are lebanese?..

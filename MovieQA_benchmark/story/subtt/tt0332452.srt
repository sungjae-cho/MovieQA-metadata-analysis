1
00:01:32,989 --> 00:01:35,583
<i>Men are haunted by the vastness</i>
<i>of eternity.</i>

2
00:01:35,949 --> 00:01:37,701
<i>And so we ask ourselves...</i>

3
00:01:38,749 --> 00:01:41,866
<i>... will our actions echo</i>
<i>across the centuries?</i>

4
00:01:42,829 --> 00:01:46,742
<i>Will strangers hear our names</i>
<i>long after we're gone...</i>

5
00:01:47,229 --> 00:01:49,140
<i>... and wonder who we were...</i>

6
00:01:49,629 --> 00:01:51,540
<i>... how bravely we fought...</i>

7
00:01:52,589 --> 00:01:54,500
<i>... how fiercely we loved?</i>

8
00:03:40,912 --> 00:03:42,265
Good day for the crows.

9
00:03:43,152 --> 00:03:45,541
Remove your army from my land.

10
00:03:45,712 --> 00:03:47,464
I like your land.

11
00:03:48,032 --> 00:03:51,024
I think we'll stay. I like your soldiers too.

12
00:03:51,232 --> 00:03:52,665
They won't fight for you.

13
00:03:52,872 --> 00:03:54,783
That's what the Messenians said.

14
00:03:54,952 --> 00:03:57,830
And the Arcadians and the Epeians.

15
00:03:58,112 --> 00:04:00,865
Now they all fight for me.

16
00:04:01,072 --> 00:04:03,461
You can't have the whole world,
Agamemnon.

17
00:04:03,632 --> 00:04:05,862
It's too big, even for you.

18
00:04:06,112 --> 00:04:08,580
I don't want to watch another massacre.

19
00:04:08,912 --> 00:04:12,825
Let's settle this war in the old manner.
Your best fighter against my best.

20
00:04:15,912 --> 00:04:17,823
And if my man wins?

21
00:04:17,992 --> 00:04:19,903
We'll leave Thessaly for good.

22
00:04:21,272 --> 00:04:23,183
Boagrius!

23
00:04:41,432 --> 00:04:43,662
Achilles!

24
00:04:51,992 --> 00:04:54,381
Boagrius has this effect on many heroes.

25
00:04:55,752 --> 00:04:57,549
Careful who you insult, old king.

26
00:05:00,872 --> 00:05:03,784
My king, Achilles is not with the army.

27
00:05:03,952 --> 00:05:06,625
- Where is he?
- I sent a boy to look for him.

28
00:05:32,352 --> 00:05:34,388
I was having a good dream.

29
00:05:36,472 --> 00:05:37,825
Very good dream.

30
00:05:38,712 --> 00:05:41,988
King Agamemnon sent me.
He needs to...

31
00:05:42,152 --> 00:05:44,222
I'll speak to your king in the morning.

32
00:05:44,392 --> 00:05:46,303
But my lord, it is morning.

33
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:51,582
They're waiting for you.

34
00:05:58,992 --> 00:06:01,142
Are the stories about you true?

35
00:06:02,912 --> 00:06:05,585
They say your mother is
an immortal goddess.

36
00:06:07,232 --> 00:06:08,745
They say you can't be killed.

37
00:06:08,912 --> 00:06:11,665
I wouldn't be bothering
with the shield then, would I?

38
00:06:11,832 --> 00:06:14,062
The Thessalonian you're fighting...

39
00:06:14,232 --> 00:06:18,384
...he's the biggest man I've ever seen.
I wouldn't want to fight him.

40
00:06:20,592 --> 00:06:23,106
That's why no one will remember
your name.

41
00:06:46,832 --> 00:06:50,188
Perhaps we should have our war
tomorrow, when you're better rested.

42
00:06:50,352 --> 00:06:52,786
I should have you whipped
for your impudence!

43
00:06:55,072 --> 00:06:56,551
Perhaps you should fight him.

44
00:06:56,872 --> 00:06:58,464
Achilles.

45
00:06:59,192 --> 00:07:00,944
Achilles.

46
00:07:02,592 --> 00:07:06,267
Look at the men's faces.
You can save hundreds of them.

47
00:07:06,832 --> 00:07:10,029
You can end this war
with a swing of your sword.

48
00:07:10,272 --> 00:07:12,388
Let them go home to their wives.

49
00:07:17,952 --> 00:07:22,423
Imagine a king who fights his
own battles. Wouldn't that be a sight.

50
00:07:25,552 --> 00:07:30,228
Of all the warlords loved by the gods,
I hate him the most.

51
00:08:20,872 --> 00:08:22,703
Is there no one else?

52
00:08:27,992 --> 00:08:29,664
Is there no one else?

53
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:36,030
Who are you, soldier?

54
00:08:36,992 --> 00:08:39,825
Achilles. Son of Peleus.

55
00:08:40,712 --> 00:08:41,986
Achilles?

56
00:08:42,712 --> 00:08:44,464
I'll remember the name.

57
00:08:45,592 --> 00:08:48,823
The ruler of Thessaly carries this scepter.

58
00:08:50,552 --> 00:08:51,826
Give it to your king.

59
00:08:53,352 --> 00:08:54,831
He's not my king.

60
00:09:14,312 --> 00:09:15,586
<i>Brothers in arms!</i>

61
00:09:15,752 --> 00:09:17,868
- Friendship!
- <i>Friendship!</i>

62
00:09:25,272 --> 00:09:28,389
Princes of Troy,
on our last night together...

63
00:09:29,152 --> 00:09:30,949
...Queen Helen and I salute you.

64
00:09:33,592 --> 00:09:35,822
We've had our conflicts before, it's true.

65
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:39,064
We fought many battles,
Sparta and Troy. And fought well!

66
00:09:41,192 --> 00:09:43,501
But I have always respected your father.

67
00:09:43,672 --> 00:09:46,106
Priam is a good king, a good man.

68
00:09:46,272 --> 00:09:50,151
I respected him as an adversary.
I respect him now as my ally.

69
00:09:52,232 --> 00:09:54,905
Hector, Paris,
young princes, come. Stand.

70
00:09:55,392 --> 00:09:56,666
Drink with me.

71
00:09:59,192 --> 00:10:00,466
Let us drink to peace.

72
00:10:01,272 --> 00:10:04,708
To peace between Troy and Sparta.

73
00:10:06,152 --> 00:10:09,986
May the gods keep the wolves
in the hills and the women in our beds.

74
00:10:34,392 --> 00:10:36,622
- For the gods.
- For the gods.

75
00:11:18,352 --> 00:11:20,070
You shouldn't be here.

76
00:11:20,232 --> 00:11:22,541
That's what you said last night.

77
00:11:23,992 --> 00:11:26,062
Last night was a mistake.

78
00:11:28,312 --> 00:11:30,143
And the night before?

79
00:11:31,192 --> 00:11:33,581
I've made many mistakes this week.

80
00:11:47,192 --> 00:11:49,342
Do you want me to go?

81
00:12:31,592 --> 00:12:33,423
Pearls from the Sea of Propontis.

82
00:12:41,512 --> 00:12:43,150
They're beautiful.

83
00:12:44,912 --> 00:12:46,664
But I can't wear them.

84
00:12:47,672 --> 00:12:49,867
Menelaus would kill us both.

85
00:12:51,872 --> 00:12:53,624
Don't be afraid of him.

86
00:12:54,672 --> 00:12:56,742
I'm not afraid of dying.

87
00:12:59,512 --> 00:13:01,548
I'm afraid of tomorrow.

88
00:13:04,752 --> 00:13:08,665
I'm afraid of watching you sail away
and knowing you'll never come back.

89
00:13:13,672 --> 00:13:17,585
Before you came to Sparta,
I was a ghost.

90
00:13:18,352 --> 00:13:21,389
I walked, and I ate,
and I swam in the sea...

91
00:13:22,472 --> 00:13:24,508
...but I was just a ghost.

92
00:13:24,952 --> 00:13:26,590
You don't have to fear tomorrow.

93
00:13:27,992 --> 00:13:29,664
Come with me.

94
00:13:33,752 --> 00:13:36,220
Don't play with me. Don't play.

95
00:13:37,472 --> 00:13:40,384
If you come, we'll never be safe.

96
00:13:40,912 --> 00:13:44,063
Men will hunt us, the gods will curse us.

97
00:13:45,152 --> 00:13:46,426
But I'll love you.

98
00:13:48,632 --> 00:13:50,543
Till the day they burn my body...

99
00:13:51,432 --> 00:13:53,263
...I will love you.

100
00:14:14,392 --> 00:14:18,431
A beautiful morning.
Poseidon has blessed our voyage.

101
00:14:19,032 --> 00:14:22,866
Sometimes the gods bless you in the
morning and curse you in the afternoon.

102
00:14:23,032 --> 00:14:25,546
Drop sail!

103
00:14:27,152 --> 00:14:28,631
Do you love me, brother?

104
00:14:30,072 --> 00:14:32,142
Would you protect me
against any enemy?

105
00:14:34,992 --> 00:14:37,108
The last time you spoke to me like this...

106
00:14:37,272 --> 00:14:40,469
...you were 10 years old,
and you'd just stolen Father's horse.

107
00:14:41,472 --> 00:14:43,702
What have you done now?

108
00:14:44,672 --> 00:14:45,991
I must show you something.

109
00:15:14,552 --> 00:15:15,826
Where is she?

110
00:15:16,272 --> 00:15:20,265
I swear by the father of the gods,
I will gut you here if you don't tell me!

111
00:15:20,432 --> 00:15:22,150
My king!

112
00:15:24,032 --> 00:15:25,351
She left.

113
00:15:25,512 --> 00:15:26,786
With the Trojans.

114
00:15:28,712 --> 00:15:31,545
The fisherman here saw her
board their ship.

115
00:15:32,752 --> 00:15:34,151
The Trojans?

116
00:15:35,952 --> 00:15:37,988
With the young prince, Paris. She...

117
00:15:39,712 --> 00:15:41,782
Get my ship ready.

118
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:45,262
Turn us round. Back to Sparta.

119
00:15:45,432 --> 00:15:46,706
High on the sail!

120
00:15:46,872 --> 00:15:48,305
- Wait, wait.
- You fool!

121
00:15:48,472 --> 00:15:50,702
- Listen to me.
- Do you know what you've done?

122
00:15:50,872 --> 00:15:54,148
Do you know how many years our father
worked for peace?

123
00:15:54,632 --> 00:15:56,463
I love her.

124
00:15:57,752 --> 00:15:59,424
It's all a game to you, isn't it?

125
00:15:59,592 --> 00:16:03,221
You roam from town to town, bedding
merchants' wives and temple maids.

126
00:16:03,392 --> 00:16:05,428
You think you know
something about love.

127
00:16:05,592 --> 00:16:06,991
What about your father's love?

128
00:16:07,152 --> 00:16:09,666
You spat on him when you
brought her on this ship!

129
00:16:09,912 --> 00:16:13,700
What about the love for your country?
You'd let Troy burn for this woman?

130
00:16:17,192 --> 00:16:19,342
I won't let you start a war for her.

131
00:16:19,512 --> 00:16:20,945
May I speak?

132
00:16:22,072 --> 00:16:25,985
What you're saying is true. I've wronged
you. I've wronged our father.

133
00:16:26,152 --> 00:16:29,110
If you want to take Helen
back to Sparta, so be it.

134
00:16:29,872 --> 00:16:31,510
But I go with her.

135
00:16:32,232 --> 00:16:33,824
To Sparta? They'll kill you.

136
00:16:33,992 --> 00:16:36,222
Then I'll die fighting.

137
00:16:36,472 --> 00:16:39,828
Oh, and that sounds heroic to you,
doesn't it? To die fighting.

138
00:16:39,992 --> 00:16:42,870
- Little brother, have you ever killed a man?
- No.

139
00:16:43,032 --> 00:16:45,023
- Ever seen a man die in combat?
- No.

140
00:16:45,192 --> 00:16:49,265
I've killed men, and I've heard them
dying. And I've watched them dying.

141
00:16:49,432 --> 00:16:52,105
And there's nothing glorious about it.
Nothing poetic.

142
00:16:52,272 --> 00:16:55,423
You say you want to die for love.
You know nothing about dying.

143
00:16:55,592 --> 00:16:57,662
And you know nothing about love!

144
00:16:57,832 --> 00:17:00,630
All the same, I go with her.

145
00:17:00,792 --> 00:17:02,908
I won't ask you to fight my war.

146
00:17:06,072 --> 00:17:07,710
You already have.

147
00:17:09,672 --> 00:17:11,071
To Troy!

148
00:17:11,232 --> 00:17:14,144
About ship! Set sail!

149
00:17:47,512 --> 00:17:50,788
- I want her back.
- Well, of course you do.

150
00:17:51,032 --> 00:17:52,545
She's a beautiful woman.

151
00:17:52,712 --> 00:17:56,148
I want her back so I can kill her
with my own two hands.

152
00:17:56,632 --> 00:17:59,510
I won't rest till I've burned Troy
to the ground.

153
00:17:59,672 --> 00:18:01,708
I thought you wanted peace with Troy.

154
00:18:01,872 --> 00:18:03,669
I should have listened to you.

155
00:18:03,832 --> 00:18:05,982
Peace is for the women...

156
00:18:06,472 --> 00:18:08,303
...and the weak.

157
00:18:09,432 --> 00:18:12,151
Empires are forged by war.

158
00:18:12,552 --> 00:18:16,227
All my life, I've stood by your side,
fought your enemies.

159
00:18:16,832 --> 00:18:20,188
You're the elder, you reap the glory.
This is the way of the world.

160
00:18:20,552 --> 00:18:23,828
But have I ever complained?
Have I ever asked you for anything?

161
00:18:23,992 --> 00:18:26,665
Never. You're a man of honor.

162
00:18:28,552 --> 00:18:30,463
Will you go to war with me, brother?

163
00:18:40,832 --> 00:18:44,347
I always thought my brother's wife
was a foolish woman...

164
00:18:44,512 --> 00:18:47,231
...but she's proved to be very useful.

165
00:18:47,872 --> 00:18:49,942
The Trojans have never been conquered.

166
00:18:50,552 --> 00:18:52,588
Some say they can't be conquered.

167
00:18:52,752 --> 00:18:56,904
Old King Priam thinks he's untouchable
behind his high walls.

168
00:18:57,112 --> 00:18:59,945
He thinks the sun god will protect him.

169
00:19:00,152 --> 00:19:02,666
But the gods protect only...

170
00:19:03,512 --> 00:19:05,264
...the strong!

171
00:19:05,992 --> 00:19:08,142
If Troy falls...

172
00:19:08,312 --> 00:19:11,349
...I control the Aegean.

173
00:19:11,512 --> 00:19:14,106
Hector commands the finest army
in the east.

174
00:19:14,272 --> 00:19:17,582
I'll attack them with the greatest force
the world has ever seen.

175
00:19:17,752 --> 00:19:20,824
I want all the kings of Greece
and their armies.

176
00:19:21,112 --> 00:19:22,830
Send emissaries in the morning.

177
00:19:22,992 --> 00:19:24,630
One last thing.

178
00:19:24,792 --> 00:19:27,989
We need Achilles and his Myrmidons.

179
00:19:30,032 --> 00:19:31,465
Achilles.

180
00:19:32,992 --> 00:19:37,110
He can't be controlled.
He's as likely to fight us as the Trojans.

181
00:19:37,272 --> 00:19:40,548
We don't need to control him,
we need to unleash him.

182
00:19:41,232 --> 00:19:43,541
That man was born to end lives.

183
00:19:43,712 --> 00:19:47,944
Yes, he's a gifted killer.
But he threatens everything I've built.

184
00:19:48,192 --> 00:19:49,910
Before me, Greece was nothing.

185
00:19:50,072 --> 00:19:52,347
I brought all the
Greek kingdoms together.

186
00:19:52,552 --> 00:19:56,261
I created a nation out of fire worshipers
and snake eaters!

187
00:19:56,432 --> 00:19:59,071
I build the future, Nestor. Me!

188
00:20:01,112 --> 00:20:03,148
Achilles is the past.

189
00:20:03,312 --> 00:20:07,464
A man who fights for no flag.
A man loyal to no country.

190
00:20:07,632 --> 00:20:11,022
How many battles have we won
off the edge of his sword?

191
00:20:11,192 --> 00:20:14,309
This will be the greatest war
the world has ever seen.

192
00:20:14,472 --> 00:20:16,781
We need the greatest warrior.

193
00:20:20,912 --> 00:20:23,267
There's only one man he'll listen to.

194
00:20:39,512 --> 00:20:41,025
Never hesitate.

195
00:20:51,272 --> 00:20:53,024
Nervous?

196
00:20:55,312 --> 00:20:57,268
Petrified.

197
00:20:58,592 --> 00:21:01,265
You told me never
to change sword hands.

198
00:21:01,792 --> 00:21:06,070
Yes. When you know how to use it,
you won't be taking my orders.

199
00:21:23,992 --> 00:21:27,667
Your reputation for hospitality
is fast becoming legend.

200
00:21:33,392 --> 00:21:35,189
Patroclus, my cousin.

201
00:21:35,792 --> 00:21:37,589
Odysseus, king of lthaca.

202
00:21:38,392 --> 00:21:41,429
Patroclus. I knew your parents well.

203
00:21:41,592 --> 00:21:42,945
I miss them.

204
00:21:44,392 --> 00:21:47,270
Now you have this one
watching over you, eh?

205
00:21:47,432 --> 00:21:49,821
Learning from Achilles himself.

206
00:21:50,592 --> 00:21:52,503
Kings would kill for the honor.

207
00:21:52,672 --> 00:21:55,186
Are you here at Agamemnon's bidding?

208
00:21:56,152 --> 00:21:57,426
We need to talk.

209
00:22:01,032 --> 00:22:02,784
I will not fight for him.

210
00:22:03,352 --> 00:22:05,912
I'm not asking you to fight for him.

211
00:22:07,592 --> 00:22:09,583
I'm asking you to fight for the Greeks.

212
00:22:09,752 --> 00:22:11,982
Are the Greeks tired of fighting
each other?

213
00:22:12,152 --> 00:22:15,303
- For now.
- The Trojans never harmed me.

214
00:22:15,512 --> 00:22:17,184
They insulted Greece.

215
00:22:17,352 --> 00:22:21,061
They insulted a man who couldn't hold
on to his wife. Is that my business?

216
00:22:21,232 --> 00:22:23,587
Your business is war, my friend.

217
00:22:23,752 --> 00:22:25,708
Is it? The man has no honor.

218
00:22:25,872 --> 00:22:29,103
Let Achilles fight for honor.
Let Agamemnon fight for power.

219
00:22:29,272 --> 00:22:32,230
And let the gods decide
which man to glorify.

220
00:22:32,432 --> 00:22:35,026
- For the Greeks!
- Forget Agamemnon.

221
00:22:35,472 --> 00:22:36,905
Fight for me.

222
00:22:37,272 --> 00:22:40,469
My wife will feel much better
if she knows you're by my side.

223
00:22:40,632 --> 00:22:42,065
I'll feel much better.

224
00:22:44,152 --> 00:22:47,030
We're sending the largest fleet
that ever sailed.

225
00:22:47,192 --> 00:22:48,705
A thousand ships.

226
00:22:49,032 --> 00:22:51,592
Prince Hector.
Is he as good a warrior as they say?

227
00:22:51,752 --> 00:22:54,061
The best of all the Trojans.

228
00:22:54,672 --> 00:22:57,789
Some say he's better
than all the Greeks too.

229
00:22:57,952 --> 00:22:59,863
Even if your cousin doesn't come...

230
00:23:00,072 --> 00:23:03,508
...I hope you'll join us.
We could use a strong arm like yours.

231
00:23:04,472 --> 00:23:06,827
Play your tricks on me,
but not my cousin.

232
00:23:07,152 --> 00:23:09,950
You have your swords. I have my tricks.

233
00:23:11,152 --> 00:23:13,143
We play with the toys the gods give us.

234
00:23:14,872 --> 00:23:16,624
We sail for Troy in three days.

235
00:23:20,872 --> 00:23:22,863
This war will never be forgotten.

236
00:23:23,512 --> 00:23:25,980
Nor will the heroes who fight in it.

237
00:23:53,672 --> 00:23:55,822
I knew they would come for you.

238
00:23:56,632 --> 00:23:58,827
Long before you were born...

239
00:23:59,672 --> 00:24:01,390
...I knew they would come.

240
00:24:02,072 --> 00:24:04,108
They want you to fight in Troy.

241
00:24:09,432 --> 00:24:12,105
I'm making you
another seashell necklace.

242
00:24:12,632 --> 00:24:14,987
Like the ones I made you
when you were a boy.

243
00:24:15,152 --> 00:24:16,551
Do you remember?

244
00:24:20,272 --> 00:24:21,591
Mother...

245
00:24:24,432 --> 00:24:26,184
...tonight, I decide.

246
00:24:26,352 --> 00:24:28,308
If you stay in Lárisa...

247
00:24:29,552 --> 00:24:31,110
...you will find peace.

248
00:24:31,272 --> 00:24:33,103
You will find a wonderful woman.

249
00:24:33,272 --> 00:24:36,423
You will have sons and daughters,
and they will have children.

250
00:24:36,912 --> 00:24:38,709
And they will love you.

251
00:24:38,872 --> 00:24:41,432
When you are gone,
they will remember you.

252
00:24:44,952 --> 00:24:48,740
But when your children are dead
and their children after them...

253
00:24:49,832 --> 00:24:51,823
...your name will be lost.

254
00:24:55,512 --> 00:24:56,786
If you go to Troy...

255
00:24:57,912 --> 00:24:59,982
...glory will be yours.

256
00:25:01,552 --> 00:25:05,909
They will write stories about your
victories for thousands of years.

257
00:25:06,712 --> 00:25:09,590
The world will remember your name.

258
00:25:10,312 --> 00:25:12,428
But if you go to Troy...

259
00:25:14,712 --> 00:25:16,987
...you will never come home.

260
00:25:18,192 --> 00:25:21,901
For your glory walks hand in hand
with your doom.

261
00:25:24,112 --> 00:25:26,387
And I shall never see you again.

262
00:27:39,752 --> 00:27:42,107
- My son.
- Father.

263
00:27:46,872 --> 00:27:49,067
Paris.

264
00:27:54,472 --> 00:27:55,746
Father.

265
00:27:57,032 --> 00:27:59,262
- This is Helen.
- Helen?

266
00:28:00,312 --> 00:28:01,825
Helen of Sparta?

267
00:28:02,512 --> 00:28:04,389
Helen of Troy.

268
00:28:06,832 --> 00:28:08,948
I've heard rumors of your beauty.

269
00:28:11,192 --> 00:28:12,625
For once...

270
00:28:13,192 --> 00:28:15,103
...the gossips were right.

271
00:28:17,312 --> 00:28:18,540
Welcome.

272
00:28:19,112 --> 00:28:21,421
Come, you must be tired.

273
00:28:33,552 --> 00:28:35,190
Look.

274
00:28:36,912 --> 00:28:38,630
He's grown.

275
00:28:39,112 --> 00:28:40,465
He is strong.

276
00:28:40,632 --> 00:28:42,668
- Briseis!
- Paris!

277
00:28:46,232 --> 00:28:49,668
Beloved cousin, your beauty grows
with each new moon.

278
00:28:50,392 --> 00:28:52,303
Briseis.

279
00:28:53,872 --> 00:28:55,464
A servant of Apollo now.

280
00:28:55,632 --> 00:28:59,386
The young men of Troy were devastated
when Briseis chose the virgin robes.

281
00:29:20,232 --> 00:29:21,506
Father...

282
00:29:21,672 --> 00:29:24,140
...I know this is the last thing we need.

283
00:29:24,312 --> 00:29:28,669
It is the will of the gods.
Everything is in their hands.

284
00:29:29,272 --> 00:29:33,470
- But I'm surprised you let him bring her.
- Lf I'd let him fight Menelaus for her...

285
00:29:33,632 --> 00:29:36,624
...you'd be burning a son's body,
not welcoming a daughter.

286
00:29:36,792 --> 00:29:39,260
We could send peace envoys
to Menelaus.

287
00:29:39,432 --> 00:29:42,151
You know Menelaus.
He'd spear their heads to his gate.

288
00:29:42,352 --> 00:29:44,183
What would you have me do?

289
00:29:44,792 --> 00:29:47,590
Put her on a ship and send her home.

290
00:29:50,392 --> 00:29:53,543
Women have always loved Paris,
and he has loved them back.

291
00:29:53,712 --> 00:29:55,270
But this is different.

292
00:29:55,432 --> 00:29:57,662
Something has changed in him.

293
00:29:57,832 --> 00:30:01,507
If we send her home to Menelaus,
he will follow her.

294
00:30:02,392 --> 00:30:05,190
This is my country,
and these are my countrymen.

295
00:30:05,352 --> 00:30:08,742
I don't want to see them suffer
so my brother can have his prize.

296
00:30:09,592 --> 00:30:11,742
It's not just the Spartans
coming after her.

297
00:30:11,912 --> 00:30:14,062
By now, Menelaus has gone
to Agamemnon.

298
00:30:14,232 --> 00:30:16,792
And Agamemnon has wanted
to destroy us for years.

299
00:30:17,192 --> 00:30:21,583
Enemies have been attacking us
for centuries. Our walls still stand.

300
00:30:22,392 --> 00:30:25,145
Father, we can't win this war.

301
00:30:25,992 --> 00:30:28,222
Apollo watches over us.

302
00:30:28,632 --> 00:30:31,829
Even Agamemnon
is no match for the gods.

303
00:30:31,992 --> 00:30:34,631
And how many battalions
does the sun god command?

304
00:30:34,792 --> 00:30:36,191
Do not mock the gods.

305
00:30:42,152 --> 00:30:43,744
They're coming for me.

306
00:30:45,112 --> 00:30:46,864
The wind is bringing them closer.

307
00:30:47,032 --> 00:30:48,624
What if we left?

308
00:30:48,792 --> 00:30:50,862
Tonight. Right now.

309
00:30:51,712 --> 00:30:55,341
What if we went down to the stables,
took two horses and left?

310
00:30:55,552 --> 00:30:57,383
Ride east, keep riding.

311
00:30:58,072 --> 00:31:00,632
- And go where?
- Away from here.

312
00:31:01,112 --> 00:31:04,422
I could hunt deer, rabbit. I could feed us.

313
00:31:07,192 --> 00:31:08,511
But this is your home.

314
00:31:08,912 --> 00:31:10,709
You left your home for me.

315
00:31:14,592 --> 00:31:16,742
Sparta was never my home.

316
00:31:17,312 --> 00:31:20,145
My parents sent my there when I was 16
to marry Menelaus.

317
00:31:20,312 --> 00:31:22,064
But it was never my home.

318
00:31:22,232 --> 00:31:23,950
We'll live off the land.

319
00:31:24,112 --> 00:31:27,548
No more palaces for us. No more
servants. We don't need any of that.

320
00:31:27,712 --> 00:31:28,986
And your family?

321
00:31:29,152 --> 00:31:32,827
We'd be protecting my family. If we're
not here, what's the need for war?

322
00:31:32,992 --> 00:31:36,621
Menelaus won't give up.
He'll track us to the end of the world.

323
00:31:36,792 --> 00:31:40,501
He doesn't know these lands. I do.
We can lose ourselves in a day.

324
00:31:40,672 --> 00:31:42,628
You don't know Menelaus.

325
00:31:42,832 --> 00:31:44,345
You don't know his brother.

326
00:31:44,512 --> 00:31:47,868
They'll burn every house in Troy
to find us.

327
00:31:49,072 --> 00:31:51,028
They'll never believe we've left.

328
00:31:51,712 --> 00:31:55,182
And even if they do,
they'll burn it for spite.

329
00:31:58,392 --> 00:32:00,781
Then I'll make it easy for him to find me.

330
00:32:03,352 --> 00:32:05,912
I'll walk right up to him
and tell him you're mine.

331
00:32:11,032 --> 00:32:12,943
You're very young, my love.

332
00:33:18,872 --> 00:33:20,305
Look at that.

333
00:34:12,952 --> 00:34:15,341
Take up your positions!

334
00:34:41,952 --> 00:34:43,226
My lord?

335
00:34:44,832 --> 00:34:46,743
Should we wait for the others?

336
00:34:47,632 --> 00:34:50,829
- They brought us here for war.
- Yes, but Agamemnon's orders...

337
00:34:50,992 --> 00:34:53,347
You fight for me, Eudorus,
or Agamemnon?

338
00:34:53,512 --> 00:34:54,786
For you, my lord.

339
00:34:54,952 --> 00:34:59,184
Then fight for me. And let the servants
of Agamemnon fight for him.

340
00:35:03,272 --> 00:35:04,546
Black sail.

341
00:35:04,792 --> 00:35:06,350
It's Achilles.

342
00:35:06,512 --> 00:35:07,991
What's the fool doing?

343
00:35:08,192 --> 00:35:10,911
He's going to take the beach of Troy
with 50 men?

344
00:35:17,192 --> 00:35:19,069
Make way there! Make way!

345
00:35:29,592 --> 00:35:32,789
Tecton, is the Apollonian Guard ready?

346
00:35:33,032 --> 00:35:36,149
- Waiting at the city gates.
- Good. I'll be right there.

347
00:35:36,952 --> 00:35:39,625
Lysander, how long
before the army is ready?

348
00:35:39,792 --> 00:35:42,864
Half of our men are still coming.
We have to arm them...

349
00:35:43,032 --> 00:35:44,465
- How long?
- Noon.

350
00:35:44,632 --> 00:35:46,190
Make it sooner.

351
00:35:57,752 --> 00:35:59,424
Patroclus!

352
00:36:02,192 --> 00:36:03,784
Put down your spear.

353
00:36:03,952 --> 00:36:05,943
- I'm fighting the Trojans.
- Not today.

354
00:36:06,112 --> 00:36:08,068
I'm ready. You taught me how to fight.

355
00:36:08,272 --> 00:36:11,981
And you're a good student.
But you're not a Myrmidon yet.

356
00:36:13,592 --> 00:36:15,105
Look at these men.

357
00:36:15,272 --> 00:36:19,424
They are the fiercest soldiers in all
of Greece. Each of them has bled for me.

358
00:36:19,592 --> 00:36:21,503
- Guard the ship.
- But this is a war.

359
00:36:21,672 --> 00:36:25,790
Cousin, I can't fight the Trojans if I'm
concerned for you. Guard the ship.

360
00:36:46,152 --> 00:36:47,790
Trojans!

361
00:36:50,592 --> 00:36:53,425
All my life, I've lived by a code.

362
00:36:53,632 --> 00:36:55,668
And the code is simple:

363
00:36:55,912 --> 00:36:58,551
Honor the gods, love your woman...

364
00:36:59,352 --> 00:37:00,751
...and defend your country.

365
00:37:02,992 --> 00:37:04,869
Troy is mother to us all.

366
00:37:05,352 --> 00:37:06,626
Fight for her!

367
00:37:25,312 --> 00:37:27,189
Myrmidons...

368
00:37:27,992 --> 00:37:29,664
...my brothers of the sword.

369
00:37:30,952 --> 00:37:34,342
I'd rather fight beside you
than any army of thousands.

370
00:37:34,512 --> 00:37:37,629
Let no man forget how menacing we are.
We are lions!

371
00:37:41,352 --> 00:37:45,948
Do you know what's there, waiting,
beyond that beach?

372
00:37:46,112 --> 00:37:49,149
Lmmortality! Take it! It's yours!

373
00:38:01,632 --> 00:38:03,509
Fight positions!

374
00:38:05,832 --> 00:38:07,550
Archers!

375
00:38:25,392 --> 00:38:27,030
Forward!

376
00:38:49,152 --> 00:38:51,188
The man wants to die.

377
00:39:10,752 --> 00:39:12,151
On my command!

378
00:39:19,032 --> 00:39:20,784
Break off! Break off!

379
00:39:58,752 --> 00:40:00,026
Look at him.

380
00:40:00,752 --> 00:40:02,026
Look.

381
00:40:03,992 --> 00:40:06,028
Row, you lazy whores, row!

382
00:40:07,312 --> 00:40:10,031
Greeks are dying! Row!

383
00:40:36,312 --> 00:40:39,384
Those men down there need help. Now!
Tecton, with me.

384
00:40:48,152 --> 00:40:50,620
Flank! To the flank!

385
00:41:29,192 --> 00:41:32,309
<i>Achilles! Achilles!</i>

386
00:42:04,632 --> 00:42:07,749
Back to the city! Back to the city!

387
00:42:14,832 --> 00:42:18,427
The sun god is a patron of Troy,
our enemy.

388
00:42:19,592 --> 00:42:22,152
Take whatever treasure you can find.

389
00:42:26,152 --> 00:42:27,790
With your permission, my lord.

390
00:42:32,512 --> 00:42:35,345
- Speak.
- Apollo sees everything.

391
00:42:35,512 --> 00:42:38,185
Perhaps it is not wise to offend him.

392
00:43:00,032 --> 00:43:01,385
Warn the men.

393
00:43:02,512 --> 00:43:04,070
Wait.

394
00:44:33,032 --> 00:44:37,025
You are very brave or very stupid
to come after me alone.

395
00:44:38,232 --> 00:44:39,984
You must be Hector.

396
00:44:46,352 --> 00:44:47,626
Do you know who I am?

397
00:44:47,832 --> 00:44:49,470
These priests weren't armed.

398
00:44:53,392 --> 00:44:55,428
Fight me!

399
00:45:01,472 --> 00:45:03,781
Why kill you now, prince of Troy...

400
00:45:03,952 --> 00:45:06,386
...with no one here to see you fall?

401
00:45:16,352 --> 00:45:17,546
Why did you come here?

402
00:45:17,752 --> 00:45:20,346
They'll be talking about this war
for 1000 years.

403
00:45:20,512 --> 00:45:23,390
In 1000 years, the dust
from our bones will be gone.

404
00:45:23,552 --> 00:45:25,907
Yes, prince. But our names will remain.

405
00:45:36,152 --> 00:45:39,986
Go home, prince. Drink some wine,
make love to your wife.

406
00:45:40,312 --> 00:45:41,950
Tomorrow, we'll have our war.

407
00:45:44,512 --> 00:45:46,503
You speak of war as if it's a game.

408
00:45:46,672 --> 00:45:50,347
How many wives wait at Troy's gates
for husbands they'll never see again?

409
00:45:50,512 --> 00:45:51,991
Your brother can comfort them.

410
00:45:52,152 --> 00:45:55,189
I hear he's good at charming
other men's wives.

411
00:46:07,912 --> 00:46:09,504
My lord, you let him go?

412
00:46:12,512 --> 00:46:15,185
It's too early in the day
for killing princes.

413
00:46:46,352 --> 00:46:48,343
<i>Achilles! Achilles!</i>

414
00:47:19,312 --> 00:47:21,667
- Achilles.
- Ajax.

415
00:47:22,192 --> 00:47:26,583
You're as fearless as the gods.
I'm honored to go to war with you.

416
00:47:26,752 --> 00:47:28,105
As am I.

417
00:47:29,112 --> 00:47:31,262
If you sailed slower,
the war would be over.

418
00:47:31,432 --> 00:47:33,992
I'll miss the start as long as I'm here
at the end.

419
00:47:36,232 --> 00:47:38,348
I've got something to show you.

420
00:47:55,752 --> 00:47:58,710
The men found her
hiding in the temple.

421
00:47:59,032 --> 00:48:00,431
They thought she'd...

422
00:48:01,552 --> 00:48:03,065
...amuse you.

423
00:48:14,032 --> 00:48:15,431
What's your name?

424
00:48:19,552 --> 00:48:21,190
Did you not hear me?

425
00:48:22,552 --> 00:48:24,144
You killed Apollo's priests.

426
00:48:24,312 --> 00:48:26,826
I've killed men in five countries,
never a priest.

427
00:48:26,992 --> 00:48:28,789
Well, then your men did.

428
00:48:29,072 --> 00:48:30,983
The sun god will have his vengeance.

429
00:48:31,632 --> 00:48:32,906
What's he waiting for?

430
00:48:33,072 --> 00:48:35,188
The right time to strike.

431
00:48:36,392 --> 00:48:39,350
His priests are dead,
and his acolyte's a captive.

432
00:48:39,512 --> 00:48:42,072
- I think your god is afraid of me.
- Afraid?

433
00:48:42,232 --> 00:48:45,269
Apollo is master of the sun.
He fears nothing.

434
00:48:45,432 --> 00:48:47,992
- Where is he?
- You're nothing but a killer!

435
00:48:48,152 --> 00:48:50,791
You wouldn't know anything
about the gods.

436
00:48:52,432 --> 00:48:55,390
I know more about the gods
than your priests.

437
00:48:55,992 --> 00:48:57,425
I've seen them.

438
00:49:02,552 --> 00:49:04,270
You're royalty, aren't you?

439
00:49:06,952 --> 00:49:09,182
Spent years talking down to men.

440
00:49:13,192 --> 00:49:14,784
You must be royalty.

441
00:49:16,952 --> 00:49:18,305
What's your name?

442
00:49:23,872 --> 00:49:26,432
Even the servants of Apollo
have names.

443
00:49:29,112 --> 00:49:30,864
Briseis.

444
00:49:32,392 --> 00:49:34,303
Are you afraid, Briseis?

445
00:49:35,352 --> 00:49:36,785
Should I be?

446
00:49:40,312 --> 00:49:41,745
My lord.

447
00:49:43,832 --> 00:49:46,471
Agamemnon requests your presence.

448
00:49:47,112 --> 00:49:49,785
The kings are gathering
to celebrate the victory.

449
00:49:52,072 --> 00:49:53,790
You fought well today.

450
00:49:55,232 --> 00:49:56,790
My lord.

451
00:50:01,632 --> 00:50:03,588
What do you want here in Troy?

452
00:50:04,512 --> 00:50:06,468
You didn't come
for the Spartan queen.

453
00:50:06,632 --> 00:50:08,304
I want what all men want.

454
00:50:08,792 --> 00:50:10,384
I just want it more.

455
00:50:16,552 --> 00:50:18,543
You don't need to fear me, girl.

456
00:50:19,392 --> 00:50:21,622
You're the only Trojan
who can say that.

457
00:50:52,272 --> 00:50:55,548
You have won a great victory,
my king of kings.

458
00:50:56,352 --> 00:51:00,470
No one thought the Trojan beach
could be captured so easily.

459
00:51:00,992 --> 00:51:03,222
A beautiful gift, Triopas.

460
00:51:03,832 --> 00:51:08,860
You will be among the first to walk
in the streets of Troy tomorrow.

461
00:51:12,472 --> 00:51:16,545
My father, Neleus, had this urn made to
commemorate his victory at Cyparisseis.

462
00:51:16,712 --> 00:51:18,464
I present it to you...

463
00:51:18,712 --> 00:51:21,431
...in honor of an even more
memorable victory.

464
00:51:21,632 --> 00:51:23,190
Thank you, old friend.

465
00:51:23,832 --> 00:51:27,507
Tomorrow, we'll eat supper
in the gardens of Troy.

466
00:51:33,512 --> 00:51:34,786
Leave us.

467
00:51:42,672 --> 00:51:47,029
War is young men dying
and old men talking. You know this.

468
00:51:47,192 --> 00:51:49,183
Ignore the politics.

469
00:52:05,752 --> 00:52:07,743
Apparently, you won
some great victory.

470
00:52:07,912 --> 00:52:13,384
Perhaps you didn't notice. The Trojan
beach belonged to Priam in the morning.

471
00:52:13,552 --> 00:52:16,305
It belongs to Agamemnon
in the afternoon.

472
00:52:16,472 --> 00:52:18,667
Have the beach.
I didn't come here for sand.

473
00:52:18,832 --> 00:52:20,106
No.

474
00:52:20,272 --> 00:52:23,947
You came here because you want
your name to last through the ages.

475
00:52:26,192 --> 00:52:27,910
A great victory was won today.

476
00:52:28,432 --> 00:52:30,627
But that victory is not yours.

477
00:52:30,792 --> 00:52:33,226
Kings did not kneel to Achilles.

478
00:52:33,472 --> 00:52:36,305
Kings did not pay homage to Achilles.

479
00:52:36,472 --> 00:52:40,021
Perhaps the kings were too far behind
to see. Soldiers won the battle.

480
00:52:40,192 --> 00:52:42,387
History remembers kings!

481
00:52:42,832 --> 00:52:44,504
Not soldiers.

482
00:52:46,552 --> 00:52:49,020
Tomorrow, we'll batter down
the gates of Troy.

483
00:52:49,192 --> 00:52:51,831
I'll build monuments
on every island of Greece.

484
00:52:51,992 --> 00:52:55,109
I'll carve "Agamemnon" in the stone.

485
00:52:55,272 --> 00:52:59,026
Be careful, king of kings.
First, you need the victory.

486
00:53:03,472 --> 00:53:05,861
Your men sacked the temple
of Apollo, yes?

487
00:53:06,032 --> 00:53:07,624
You want gold? Take it.

488
00:53:07,792 --> 00:53:10,704
It's my gift to honor your courage.
Take what you wish.

489
00:53:10,872 --> 00:53:12,703
I already have.

490
00:53:14,872 --> 00:53:16,624
Aphareus!

491
00:53:17,272 --> 00:53:18,546
Haemon!

492
00:53:26,992 --> 00:53:28,266
The spoils of war.

493
00:53:28,432 --> 00:53:32,266
No argument wit you, but if you don't
release her, you'll never see home again.

494
00:53:32,432 --> 00:53:34,866
- Decide.
- Guards!

495
00:53:36,272 --> 00:53:37,785
Stop!

496
00:53:40,072 --> 00:53:41,949
Too many men have died today.

497
00:53:44,352 --> 00:53:47,230
If killing is your only talent,
that's your curse.

498
00:53:48,592 --> 00:53:51,026
I don't want anyone dying for me.

499
00:53:57,472 --> 00:54:03,183
Mighty Achilles,
silenced by a slave girl.

500
00:54:04,952 --> 00:54:07,944
Tonight, I'll have her give me a bath.

501
00:54:09,232 --> 00:54:10,870
And then...

502
00:54:11,672 --> 00:54:14,232
...who knows?
- You sack of wine!

503
00:54:16,792 --> 00:54:20,944
Before my time is done, I will look
down on your corpse and smile.

504
00:54:34,632 --> 00:54:38,068
If they want a war,
we will give them a war.

505
00:54:39,552 --> 00:54:44,148
I would match the best of Troy
against the best of Greece any day.

506
00:54:44,912 --> 00:54:48,621
The best of Greece outnumber
the best of Troy two to one.

507
00:54:49,872 --> 00:54:51,544
Glaucus.

508
00:54:51,992 --> 00:54:55,621
You have fought with me for 40 years.
Can we win this war?

509
00:54:55,792 --> 00:54:58,386
Our walls have never been breached.

510
00:54:58,592 --> 00:55:00,787
We have the finest archers
in the world.

511
00:55:01,032 --> 00:55:03,023
And we have Hector.

512
00:55:03,192 --> 00:55:05,911
Yes, we can win.

513
00:55:11,592 --> 00:55:13,822
I spoke to two farmers today.

514
00:55:14,232 --> 00:55:18,987
They saw an eagle flying
with a serpent clutched in its talons.

515
00:55:19,632 --> 00:55:22,544
This is a sign from Apollo.

516
00:55:22,712 --> 00:55:24,828
We will win a great victory tomorrow.

517
00:55:24,992 --> 00:55:26,505
Bird signs.

518
00:55:26,712 --> 00:55:29,431
You want to plan a strategy
based on bird signs.

519
00:55:29,592 --> 00:55:31,025
Hector, show respect.

520
00:55:31,352 --> 00:55:34,105
The high priest
is a servant of the gods.

521
00:55:34,272 --> 00:55:36,547
And I am a servant of Troy.

522
00:55:37,712 --> 00:55:39,782
I've always honored the gods, Father.

523
00:55:39,952 --> 00:55:43,865
But today I fought a Greek
who desecrated the statue of Apollo.

524
00:55:44,032 --> 00:55:46,068
Apollo didn't strike the man down.

525
00:55:47,072 --> 00:55:49,666
The gods won't fight this war for us.

526
00:55:49,832 --> 00:55:51,629
There won't be a war.

527
00:55:56,512 --> 00:55:58,423
This is not a conflict of nations.

528
00:55:58,592 --> 00:56:00,742
It is a dispute between two men.

529
00:56:01,592 --> 00:56:04,265
I don't want to see another Trojan die
because of me.

530
00:56:04,432 --> 00:56:06,070
Paris.

531
00:56:07,232 --> 00:56:10,702
Tomorrow morning, I will challenge
Menelaus for the right to Helen.

532
00:56:10,872 --> 00:56:15,150
The winner will take her home.
The loser will burn before nightfall.

533
00:56:33,592 --> 00:56:35,105
Father...

534
00:56:36,272 --> 00:56:38,832
...I'm sorry for the pain
I've caused you.

535
00:56:39,592 --> 00:56:41,423
Do you love her?

536
00:56:43,992 --> 00:56:48,065
You are a great king because you love
your country so much.

537
00:56:48,592 --> 00:56:50,344
Every blade of grass.

538
00:56:51,352 --> 00:56:53,183
Every grain of sand.

539
00:56:53,472 --> 00:56:54,871
Every rock in the river.

540
00:56:55,872 --> 00:56:58,067
You love all of Troy.

541
00:57:00,792 --> 00:57:02,589
That is the way I love Helen.

542
00:57:05,912 --> 00:57:08,870
I've fought many wars in my time.

543
00:57:10,232 --> 00:57:13,622
Some were fought for land,
some for power, some for glory.

544
00:57:15,632 --> 00:57:20,911
I suppose fighting for love makes
more sense than all the rest.

545
00:57:21,072 --> 00:57:23,825
But I won't be the one fighting.

546
00:57:27,112 --> 00:57:28,704
The sword of Troy.

547
00:57:29,392 --> 00:57:32,907
My father carried this sword,
and his father before him...

548
00:57:33,072 --> 00:57:35,586
...all the way back
to the founding of Troy.

549
00:57:35,752 --> 00:57:39,711
The history of our people
was written with this sword.

550
00:57:41,992 --> 00:57:44,062
Carry it with you tomorrow.

551
00:57:47,512 --> 00:57:50,345
The spirit of Troy is in that sword.

552
00:57:51,592 --> 00:57:54,584
So long as a Trojan carries it...

553
00:57:55,152 --> 00:57:57,620
...our people have a future.

554
00:58:01,312 --> 00:58:04,429
The man who killed Tecton
outside Apollo's temple...

555
00:58:05,352 --> 00:58:07,991
...I've never seen a spear
thrown like that.

556
00:58:09,112 --> 00:58:10,909
An impossible throw.

557
00:58:16,032 --> 00:58:17,750
Don't go tomorrow.

558
00:58:18,712 --> 00:58:21,351
- Please don't go.
- Paris fights tomorrow, not me.

559
00:58:21,512 --> 00:58:25,187
Fifty thousand Greeks didn't cross
the sea to watch your brother fight.

560
00:58:25,352 --> 00:58:26,705
You know this.

561
00:58:26,872 --> 00:58:28,669
You'd make a fine general, my love.

562
00:58:28,832 --> 00:58:33,223
You've been fighting your whole life.
Let other men do battle this time.

563
00:58:33,392 --> 00:58:37,908
You know I don't want to fight.
I want to see my son grow tall.

564
00:58:38,072 --> 00:58:40,461
I want to see the girls chasing after him.

565
00:58:41,312 --> 00:58:43,428
I can't lose you.

566
00:58:44,952 --> 00:58:46,670
I won't survive.

567
00:59:02,072 --> 00:59:03,664
I must see Paris.

568
00:59:11,232 --> 00:59:12,711
Wait.

569
00:59:13,632 --> 00:59:15,031
Wait!

570
00:59:20,232 --> 00:59:21,585
Helen, what are you doing?

571
00:59:21,752 --> 00:59:23,788
- Let me go.
- No.

572
00:59:30,712 --> 00:59:32,782
I saw them burn.

573
00:59:34,072 --> 00:59:36,586
I saw them burning on the pyres.

574
00:59:38,752 --> 00:59:40,310
That's my fault.

575
00:59:41,312 --> 00:59:43,667
It is. You know it is.

576
00:59:45,792 --> 00:59:47,510
All those widows.

577
00:59:48,552 --> 00:59:50,747
I still hear them screaming.

578
00:59:52,352 --> 00:59:55,389
Their husbands died because I'm here.

579
00:59:56,232 --> 00:59:57,870
I'm going down to the ships.

580
00:59:58,032 --> 00:59:59,624
No, you're not.

581
00:59:59,832 --> 01:00:03,302
- I'm giving myself back to Menelaus.
- It's too late for that.

582
01:00:03,472 --> 01:00:06,384
Do you think Agamemnon cares
about his brother's marriage?

583
01:00:06,552 --> 01:00:08,941
This is about power. Not love.

584
01:00:09,312 --> 01:00:11,303
Paris is going to fight in the morning.

585
01:00:12,712 --> 01:00:15,226
- Yes.
- Menelaus will kill him.

586
01:00:15,392 --> 01:00:16,745
I won't let that happen.

587
01:00:17,352 --> 01:00:19,183
- It's his decision.
- No.

588
01:00:19,472 --> 01:00:22,066
I can't ask anyone to fight for me.

589
01:00:23,512 --> 01:00:25,662
I'm no longer queen of Sparta.

590
01:00:27,912 --> 01:00:30,062
You're a princess of Troy now...

591
01:00:31,392 --> 01:00:33,826
...and my brother needs you tonight.

592
01:00:59,472 --> 01:01:01,064
My lord.

593
01:01:04,952 --> 01:01:06,943
My lord, the army is marching.

594
01:01:08,232 --> 01:01:10,666
- Let them march. We stay.
- But the men are ready.

595
01:01:10,832 --> 01:01:13,551
We stay till Agamemnon groans
to have Achilles back.

596
01:01:14,432 --> 01:01:15,706
As you wish.

597
01:01:26,592 --> 01:01:28,105
Are you ready to fight?

598
01:01:28,552 --> 01:01:30,907
Are you ready to kill? To take life?

599
01:01:31,872 --> 01:01:33,544
I am.

600
01:01:37,472 --> 01:01:41,147
At night, I see their faces,
all the men I've killed.

601
01:01:42,232 --> 01:01:45,463
They're standing there on the far bank
of the River Styx.

602
01:01:48,032 --> 01:01:49,624
They're waiting for me.

603
01:01:51,712 --> 01:01:53,623
They say, "Welcome, brother."

604
01:02:00,512 --> 01:02:02,389
We men are wretched things.

605
01:02:06,232 --> 01:02:09,861
I taught you how to fight,
but I never taught you why to fight.

606
01:02:10,032 --> 01:02:11,306
I fight for you.

607
01:02:11,472 --> 01:02:13,383
Who will you fight for when I'm gone?

608
01:02:16,112 --> 01:02:19,229
Soldiers, they fight for kings
they've never even met.

609
01:02:20,192 --> 01:02:22,786
They do what they're told,
die when they're told to.

610
01:02:22,952 --> 01:02:24,271
Soldiers obey.

611
01:02:26,952 --> 01:02:30,103
Don't waste your life following
some fool's orders.

612
01:02:33,112 --> 01:02:34,431
Go.

613
01:03:55,912 --> 01:03:57,789
Are you sure you want to do this?

614
01:03:58,872 --> 01:04:00,510
I started this war.

615
01:04:15,392 --> 01:04:17,223
Helen...

616
01:04:18,392 --> 01:04:19,905
...sit with me.

617
01:06:31,112 --> 01:06:32,830
Prepare to halt!

618
01:06:32,992 --> 01:06:34,664
Prepare to halt!

619
01:06:34,992 --> 01:06:36,505
Halt!

620
01:06:55,072 --> 01:06:56,664
Move.

621
01:07:24,672 --> 01:07:28,824
I see you're not hiding behind
your high walls. Valiant of you.

622
01:07:29,072 --> 01:07:31,711
Ill-advised, but valiant.

623
01:07:31,872 --> 01:07:35,467
You come here uninvited.
Go back to your ships and go home.

624
01:07:35,632 --> 01:07:37,543
We've come too far, Prince Hector.

625
01:07:37,712 --> 01:07:40,067
Prince? What prince?

626
01:07:40,232 --> 01:07:42,951
What son of a king would accept
a man's hospitality...

627
01:07:43,112 --> 01:07:47,264
...eat his food, drink his wine, then steal
his wife in the middle of the night?

628
01:07:47,432 --> 01:07:50,583
The sun was shining
when your wife left you.

629
01:07:51,392 --> 01:07:54,145
She's up there, watching,
isn't she? Good.

630
01:07:54,312 --> 01:07:56,462
I want her to watch you die.

631
01:07:57,432 --> 01:07:58,706
Not yet, brother.

632
01:08:00,712 --> 01:08:02,430
Look around you, Hector.

633
01:08:02,592 --> 01:08:06,028
I brought all the warriors of Greece
to your shores.

634
01:08:06,192 --> 01:08:08,103
You can still save Troy, young prince.

635
01:08:08,272 --> 01:08:09,671
I have two wishes.

636
01:08:09,832 --> 01:08:13,029
If you grant them,
no more of your people need die.

637
01:08:13,192 --> 01:08:16,070
First, you must give Helen
back to my brother.

638
01:08:16,472 --> 01:08:19,669
Second, Troy must submit
to my command...

639
01:08:19,912 --> 01:08:22,426
...to fight for me whenever I call.

640
01:08:22,592 --> 01:08:25,504
You want me to look upon your army
and tremble?

641
01:08:27,712 --> 01:08:29,145
Well, I see them.

642
01:08:29,632 --> 01:08:34,148
I see 50,000 men brought here
to fight for one man's greed.

643
01:08:37,752 --> 01:08:39,231
Careful, boy.

644
01:08:40,432 --> 01:08:42,150
My mercy has limits.

645
01:08:42,312 --> 01:08:44,621
And I've seen the limits of your mercy.

646
01:08:44,792 --> 01:08:49,070
And I tell you now, no son of Troy
will ever submit to a foreign ruler.

647
01:08:49,472 --> 01:08:52,430
Then every son of Troy shall die.

648
01:08:56,312 --> 01:08:58,143
There is another way.

649
01:09:00,272 --> 01:09:03,708
I love Helen. I won't give her up
and neither will you.

650
01:09:04,432 --> 01:09:06,104
So let us fight our own battle.

651
01:09:06,272 --> 01:09:09,947
The winner takes Helen home.
And let that be the end of it.

652
01:09:10,112 --> 01:09:13,548
A brave offer, but not enough.

653
01:09:14,992 --> 01:09:16,664
Let me kill this little peacock.

654
01:09:16,832 --> 01:09:21,383
I didn't come here for your pretty wife.
I came here for Troy.

655
01:09:21,552 --> 01:09:23,702
I came for my honor.

656
01:09:23,872 --> 01:09:26,227
His every breath insults me.

657
01:09:26,752 --> 01:09:30,062
Let me kill him. When he's lying
in the dust, signal to attack.

658
01:09:30,232 --> 01:09:33,269
You'll have your city.
I'll have my revenge.

659
01:09:38,592 --> 01:09:39,991
So be it.

660
01:09:44,152 --> 01:09:48,270
I accept your challenge. And tonight,
I'll drink to your bones.

661
01:09:57,352 --> 01:10:00,469
- My lord.
- Back to the line!

662
01:10:14,552 --> 01:10:16,702
Make him swing and miss. He'll tire.

663
01:10:18,352 --> 01:10:19,671
Brother...

664
01:10:19,832 --> 01:10:22,744
...if I fall, tell Helen... Tell her...

665
01:10:22,912 --> 01:10:24,584
I will.

666
01:10:24,752 --> 01:10:26,743
Don't let Menelaus hurt her. If he...

667
01:10:26,912 --> 01:10:30,188
You think of your sword and his sword
and nothing else.

668
01:11:38,912 --> 01:11:40,504
Get up.

669
01:11:40,872 --> 01:11:42,510
Come on.

670
01:12:25,952 --> 01:12:27,351
See the crows?

671
01:12:29,152 --> 01:12:31,268
They never tasted prince before.

672
01:13:04,152 --> 01:13:08,430
Is this what you left me for?!

673
01:13:08,592 --> 01:13:10,184
Fight!

674
01:13:10,512 --> 01:13:11,786
Fight me!

675
01:13:12,832 --> 01:13:14,106
You coward!

676
01:13:14,272 --> 01:13:15,500
Fight me!

677
01:13:15,672 --> 01:13:17,947
We have a pact! Fight!

678
01:13:18,472 --> 01:13:21,305
Fight him, son. Fight him.

679
01:13:21,472 --> 01:13:25,101
- Fight me!
- The Trojans have violated the agreement!

680
01:13:25,272 --> 01:13:27,706
Prepare for battle!

681
01:13:29,272 --> 01:13:30,671
This is not honor!

682
01:13:30,872 --> 01:13:33,261
This is not worthy of royalty!

683
01:13:33,672 --> 01:13:36,630
If he doesn't fight, Troy is doomed.

684
01:13:37,312 --> 01:13:38,586
The fight is over.

685
01:13:38,752 --> 01:13:40,822
The fight is not over.

686
01:13:40,992 --> 01:13:42,630
Stand back, Prince Hector.

687
01:13:42,792 --> 01:13:45,306
I'll kill him at your feet. I don't care.

688
01:13:45,472 --> 01:13:46,746
He is my brother.

689
01:14:32,272 --> 01:14:33,944
Paris!

690
01:14:42,672 --> 01:14:44,390
Go!

691
01:14:50,952 --> 01:14:52,704
Get inside, Paris!

692
01:14:53,232 --> 01:14:54,506
Archers!

693
01:14:57,672 --> 01:15:01,142
- Our men are too close to the walls.
- Pull back, you fool!

694
01:15:01,312 --> 01:15:02,586
For Troy!

695
01:15:22,392 --> 01:15:24,587
- Now!
- Loose!

696
01:15:51,832 --> 01:15:53,185
Get them in line!

697
01:15:55,152 --> 01:15:58,110
Get the men back into lines!

698
01:15:58,272 --> 01:16:00,547
Front line, push!

699
01:17:42,352 --> 01:17:43,705
Forward.

700
01:17:43,872 --> 01:17:45,146
Forward!

701
01:17:56,712 --> 01:17:57,986
Forward!

702
01:18:09,032 --> 01:18:11,387
Apollonians! Now!

703
01:18:21,672 --> 01:18:22,946
Prince Hector!

704
01:18:26,752 --> 01:18:27,980
We need to retreat!

705
01:18:28,832 --> 01:18:31,062
My army's never lost a battle yet!

706
01:18:31,232 --> 01:18:33,621
You won't have an army
if you don't fall back!

707
01:18:39,432 --> 01:18:41,502
Back to the ships!

708
01:18:41,672 --> 01:18:43,310
- Back to the ships!
- Retreat!

709
01:18:43,472 --> 01:18:44,461
- Back!
- Retreat!

710
01:18:44,632 --> 01:18:46,270
Go back!

711
01:18:51,832 --> 01:18:53,231
Back. Back to the ships!

712
01:19:35,592 --> 01:19:37,105
Fall back!

713
01:19:37,432 --> 01:19:39,866
- Men, fall back!
- Halt!

714
01:19:46,792 --> 01:19:48,191
Halt!

715
01:19:48,352 --> 01:19:49,831
But we have them on the run!

716
01:19:49,992 --> 01:19:52,108
We're in range of their archers.

717
01:19:52,272 --> 01:19:54,103
Have our men gather our fallen.

718
01:19:54,272 --> 01:19:57,070
Send an emissary to them.
They can collect their dead.

719
01:19:57,232 --> 01:19:59,621
Would they have done the same for us?

720
01:20:02,472 --> 01:20:04,030
Go! Back!

721
01:20:04,832 --> 01:20:06,470
Fall back into line!

722
01:21:15,112 --> 01:21:16,704
You think I'm a coward.

723
01:21:18,952 --> 01:21:20,510
I am a coward.

724
01:21:22,192 --> 01:21:24,023
I knew he would kill me.

725
01:21:24,992 --> 01:21:26,311
You were watching.

726
01:21:28,272 --> 01:21:29,705
My father.

727
01:21:30,832 --> 01:21:32,390
My brother.

728
01:21:32,552 --> 01:21:36,147
All of Troy. Shame didn't matter.

729
01:21:36,792 --> 01:21:38,589
I gave up my pride...

730
01:21:39,312 --> 01:21:40,904
...my honor...

731
01:21:41,792 --> 01:21:43,305
...just to live.

732
01:21:43,832 --> 01:21:45,311
For love.

733
01:21:46,112 --> 01:21:49,468
You challenged a great warrior.
That took courage.

734
01:21:51,632 --> 01:21:53,270
I betrayed you.

735
01:21:59,712 --> 01:22:01,862
Menelaus was a brave man.

736
01:22:05,032 --> 01:22:06,909
He lived for fighting.

737
01:22:10,672 --> 01:22:14,665
And every day I was with him, I wanted
to walk into the sea and drown.

738
01:22:18,232 --> 01:22:22,783
I don't want a hero, my love.
I want a man I can grow old with.

739
01:22:24,926 --> 01:22:29,920
They're laughing at me in Troy.
Drunk with victory!

740
01:22:30,246 --> 01:22:33,079
They think I'll sail home at first light.

741
01:22:33,246 --> 01:22:34,565
Maybe we should.

742
01:22:34,726 --> 01:22:36,921
Flee? Like a whipped dog?

743
01:22:37,086 --> 01:22:40,556
The men believe we came here
for Menelaus' wife.

744
01:22:41,686 --> 01:22:43,324
Won't be needing her anymore.

745
01:22:43,486 --> 01:22:46,523
My brother's blood still wets the sand,
and you insult him!

746
01:22:46,686 --> 01:22:49,246
It's no insult to say a dead man is dead.

747
01:22:49,406 --> 01:22:52,398
If we leave now, we lose all credibility.

748
01:22:52,566 --> 01:22:56,844
The Trojans can beat us so easily.
How long before the Hittites invade?

749
01:22:57,006 --> 01:23:01,284
If we stay, we stay here
for the right reasons.

750
01:23:01,446 --> 01:23:03,562
To protect Greece, not your pride.

751
01:23:03,726 --> 01:23:06,286
Your private battle with Achilles
is destroying us.

752
01:23:06,446 --> 01:23:07,720
Achilles is one man.

753
01:23:07,886 --> 01:23:10,161
Hector is one man.

754
01:23:10,686 --> 01:23:12,165
Look what he did to us today.

755
01:23:12,326 --> 01:23:16,035
Hector fights for his country!
Achilles fights only for himself!

756
01:23:16,246 --> 01:23:20,842
I don't care about the man's allegiance.
I care about his ability to win battles.

757
01:23:21,006 --> 01:23:22,439
He's right.

758
01:23:22,606 --> 01:23:24,119
The men's morale is weak.

759
01:23:24,286 --> 01:23:28,996
Even if I could make peace with Achilles,
the man won't listen to me!

760
01:23:30,206 --> 01:23:33,004
He's as likely to spear me
as to speak to me!

761
01:23:34,326 --> 01:23:35,600
I'll talk to him.

762
01:23:35,766 --> 01:23:37,165
He'll want the girl back.

763
01:23:37,566 --> 01:23:38,965
He can have that damn girl.

764
01:23:41,126 --> 01:23:42,400
I haven't touched her.

765
01:23:42,566 --> 01:23:43,840
Where is she?

766
01:23:44,046 --> 01:23:45,638
I gave her to the men.

767
01:23:47,246 --> 01:23:51,717
They need some amusement after today.

768
01:23:54,646 --> 01:23:56,841
Come on, give the bitch to me!

769
01:23:57,606 --> 01:23:58,925
Who's first?

770
01:23:59,566 --> 01:24:00,965
Trojan whore!

771
01:24:01,126 --> 01:24:03,037
What's this? A virgin's robe?

772
01:24:03,366 --> 01:24:06,244
- You won't be needing that much longer!
- Hold her.

773
01:24:11,646 --> 01:24:13,762
Better to be a Spartan slave
than a Trojan...

774
01:24:13,926 --> 01:24:15,882
Achilles!

775
01:24:43,326 --> 01:24:45,078
Are you hurt?

776
01:24:51,166 --> 01:24:53,316
I watched you fight them.
You have courage.

777
01:24:53,486 --> 01:24:57,843
To fight back when people attack me?
Dog has that kind of courage.

778
01:25:20,366 --> 01:25:21,799
Eat.

779
01:25:30,046 --> 01:25:32,765
I've known men like you my whole life.

780
01:25:33,006 --> 01:25:34,280
No, you haven't.

781
01:25:34,446 --> 01:25:37,085
You think you're so different
from 1000 others?

782
01:25:37,886 --> 01:25:41,595
Soldiers understand nothing but war.
Peace confuses them.

783
01:25:41,886 --> 01:25:44,116
- And you hate these soldiers.
- I pity them.

784
01:25:45,006 --> 01:25:47,600
Trojan soldiers died trying to protect you.

785
01:25:47,766 --> 01:25:50,758
Perhaps they deserve
more than your pity.

786
01:25:53,566 --> 01:25:55,158
Why did you choose this life?

787
01:25:55,326 --> 01:25:57,794
- What life?
- To be a great warrior.

788
01:26:00,086 --> 01:26:03,761
I chose nothing. I was born,
and this is what I am.

789
01:26:05,206 --> 01:26:08,198
And you? Why did you choose
to love a god?

790
01:26:09,086 --> 01:26:11,964
I think you'll find the romance one-sided.

791
01:26:14,406 --> 01:26:15,998
Do you enjoy provoking me?

792
01:26:17,806 --> 01:26:19,876
You've dedicated your life to the gods.

793
01:26:20,046 --> 01:26:23,516
Zeus, god of thunder. Athena,
goddess of wisdom. You serve them.

794
01:26:23,686 --> 01:26:26,120
- Yes, of course.
- And Ares, god of war?

795
01:26:26,286 --> 01:26:29,164
Who blankets his bed with the skin
of men he's killed?

796
01:26:30,806 --> 01:26:33,525
All the gods are to be feared
and respected.

797
01:26:44,246 --> 01:26:45,759
I'll tell you a secret...

798
01:26:46,326 --> 01:26:48,886
...something they don't teach you
in your temple.

799
01:26:58,966 --> 01:27:01,241
The gods envy us.

800
01:27:02,886 --> 01:27:04,956
They envy us because we're mortal.

801
01:27:06,366 --> 01:27:09,164
Because any moment might be our last.

802
01:27:09,446 --> 01:27:12,597
Everything's more beautiful
because we're doomed.

803
01:27:13,806 --> 01:27:16,604
You will never be lovelier
than you are now.

804
01:27:20,726 --> 01:27:22,398
We will never be here again.

805
01:27:31,526 --> 01:27:33,437
I thought you were a dumb brute.

806
01:27:36,886 --> 01:27:38,797
I could have forgiven a dumb brute.

807
01:28:00,046 --> 01:28:01,320
Do it.

808
01:28:07,606 --> 01:28:09,005
Nothing is easier.

809
01:28:09,166 --> 01:28:10,440
Aren't you afraid?

810
01:28:12,606 --> 01:28:16,997
Everyone dies. Today or 50 years
from now. What does it matter?

811
01:28:21,606 --> 01:28:23,324
Do it.

812
01:28:24,846 --> 01:28:26,916
You'll kill more men if I don't kill you.

813
01:28:27,086 --> 01:28:28,599
Many.

814
01:29:39,406 --> 01:29:40,839
My lord, there's...

815
01:29:55,086 --> 01:29:58,715
Tell the men to start loading the ship.
We're going home.

816
01:30:02,526 --> 01:30:04,198
Gather the stores.

817
01:30:09,006 --> 01:30:11,315
Agamemnon is a proud man.

818
01:30:12,366 --> 01:30:14,675
But he knows
when he's made a mistake.

819
01:30:14,846 --> 01:30:16,996
The man sends you
to make his apologies?

820
01:30:19,046 --> 01:30:21,640
What are you doing enthralled
to that pig of a king?

821
01:30:22,606 --> 01:30:24,801
The world seems simple to you,
my friend...

822
01:30:24,966 --> 01:30:28,322
...but when you're a king,
very few choices are simple.

823
01:30:30,246 --> 01:30:32,965
Ithaca cannot afford an enemy
like Agamemnon.

824
01:30:33,126 --> 01:30:34,718
Are we supposed to fear him?

825
01:30:34,886 --> 01:30:39,562
You don't fear anyone.
That's your problem. Fear is useful.

826
01:30:42,606 --> 01:30:44,039
We need you back.

827
01:30:44,246 --> 01:30:45,964
Greece needs you.

828
01:30:46,686 --> 01:30:49,325
Greece got along fine before I was born.

829
01:30:49,486 --> 01:30:51,636
Greece will be Greece
long after I'm dead.

830
01:30:51,926 --> 01:30:53,757
I'm not talking about the land.

831
01:30:53,926 --> 01:30:56,042
The men need you.

832
01:30:59,406 --> 01:31:00,885
Stay, Achilles.

833
01:31:01,846 --> 01:31:03,484
You were born for this war.

834
01:31:07,286 --> 01:31:08,844
Things are less simple today.

835
01:31:10,766 --> 01:31:14,839
Women have a way
of complicating things.

836
01:31:18,446 --> 01:31:21,563
Of all the kings of Greece,
I respect you the most.

837
01:31:21,726 --> 01:31:23,717
But in this war, you're a servant.

838
01:31:23,886 --> 01:31:26,878
Sometimes you have to serve
in order to lead.

839
01:31:28,326 --> 01:31:31,079
I hope you understand that one day.

840
01:31:36,006 --> 01:31:37,883
We're going home?

841
01:31:40,126 --> 01:31:41,445
We sail in the morning.

842
01:31:41,606 --> 01:31:44,916
Greeks are being slaughtered.
We can't just sail away.

843
01:31:45,086 --> 01:31:48,840
If it's fighting you still long for,
there will always be another war.

844
01:31:49,006 --> 01:31:50,280
These are our countrymen.

845
01:31:50,446 --> 01:31:53,324
You betray all of Greece
just to see Agamemnon fall.

846
01:31:53,726 --> 01:31:55,478
Someone has to lose.

847
01:32:00,606 --> 01:32:03,325
The gods favor our cause.

848
01:32:03,486 --> 01:32:06,444
Now is the time to destroy
the Greek army.

849
01:32:07,806 --> 01:32:10,115
Their morale is battered.

850
01:32:10,286 --> 01:32:13,323
Hit them now. Hit them hard.

851
01:32:13,486 --> 01:32:15,238
And they will run.

852
01:32:20,846 --> 01:32:23,121
The Myrmidons didn't fight yesterday.

853
01:32:23,286 --> 01:32:25,004
There must be dissension
among the Greeks.

854
01:32:25,166 --> 01:32:27,726
But if we attack their ships,
we will unify them.

855
01:32:28,406 --> 01:32:30,317
If they decide to attack us, let them.

856
01:32:30,486 --> 01:32:33,319
Our walls can't be breached.
We'll beat them back again.

857
01:32:37,246 --> 01:32:39,635
Yesterday, the Greeks
underestimated us.

858
01:32:40,566 --> 01:32:42,602
We should not return the favor.

859
01:32:55,566 --> 01:32:58,285
You're confident about the meaning
of these omens?

860
01:32:58,446 --> 01:33:01,836
The desecration of his temple
angers Apollo.

861
01:33:02,006 --> 01:33:04,839
The gods have cursed the Greeks.

862
01:33:10,006 --> 01:33:12,566
Prepare the army.
We attack at daybreak.

863
01:33:29,606 --> 01:33:31,597
Am I still your captive?

864
01:33:34,366 --> 01:33:35,879
You're my guest.

865
01:33:38,366 --> 01:33:41,358
In Troy, guests can leave
whenever they want.

866
01:33:41,526 --> 01:33:43,118
You should leave then.

867
01:33:49,806 --> 01:33:51,717
Would you leave this all behind?

868
01:33:56,006 --> 01:33:57,598
Would you leave Troy?

869
01:36:47,086 --> 01:36:48,838
Hold those barricades!

870
01:37:08,846 --> 01:37:10,723
Archers to the rear.

871
01:37:19,566 --> 01:37:21,636
Achilles.

872
01:37:44,046 --> 01:37:45,798
Achilles.

873
01:37:48,646 --> 01:37:50,159
Now!

874
01:37:58,766 --> 01:38:00,119
Forward!

875
01:40:35,526 --> 01:40:37,039
Enough for one day.

876
01:40:39,126 --> 01:40:40,878
Yes.

877
01:40:41,806 --> 01:40:43,239
Back to the ships!

878
01:40:43,406 --> 01:40:45,715
Back to the ships!

879
01:40:47,446 --> 01:40:49,118
It was his cousin.

880
01:40:53,326 --> 01:40:54,805
To Troy!

881
01:40:55,686 --> 01:40:58,519
- Back to the city!
- Back to the city!

882
01:40:58,686 --> 01:41:00,005
To Troy!

883
01:41:02,006 --> 01:41:04,076
We were going to sail home today.

884
01:41:06,806 --> 01:41:09,366
I don't think anyone's sailing home now.

885
01:41:26,966 --> 01:41:28,843
Achilles.

886
01:41:42,526 --> 01:41:44,323
You violated my command.

887
01:41:44,486 --> 01:41:46,716
No, my lord. There was a mistake.

888
01:41:46,886 --> 01:41:49,320
I ordered the Myrmidons to stand down.

889
01:41:49,486 --> 01:41:51,522
You led them into combat.

890
01:41:54,566 --> 01:41:58,445
I didn't lead them, my lord.
We thought you did.

891
01:42:05,766 --> 01:42:07,836
Where's Patroclus?

892
01:42:08,926 --> 01:42:10,598
Patroclus!

893
01:42:10,766 --> 01:42:12,916
We thought he was you, my lord.

894
01:42:14,566 --> 01:42:19,162
He wore your armor, your shield,
your greaves, your helmet.

895
01:42:19,326 --> 01:42:21,044
He even moved like you.

896
01:42:21,486 --> 01:42:23,477
Where is he?

897
01:42:27,246 --> 01:42:29,043
- Where?
- He's dead, my lord.

898
01:42:32,526 --> 01:42:33,959
Hector cut his throat.

899
01:42:40,886 --> 01:42:43,241
Don't!

900
01:43:11,806 --> 01:43:13,478
Where are you taking me?

901
01:43:19,086 --> 01:43:20,963
Do you remember how to get here?

902
01:43:21,486 --> 01:43:23,078
Yes.

903
01:43:30,286 --> 01:43:33,198
The next time you come here,
follow the tunnel.

904
01:43:33,366 --> 01:43:36,438
There are no turns, so you can't get lost.
Just keep walking.

905
01:43:36,606 --> 01:43:38,995
When you get to the end,
you'll be by the river.

906
01:43:39,166 --> 01:43:41,475
Follow the river until you get
to Mount Ida.

907
01:43:41,646 --> 01:43:43,238
Why are you telling me this?

908
01:43:48,766 --> 01:43:50,757
- Lf I die...
- No.

909
01:43:50,926 --> 01:43:53,440
...I don't know how long
the city will stand.

910
01:43:53,606 --> 01:43:56,200
If the Greeks get inside the walls,
it's over.

911
01:43:56,366 --> 01:43:59,597
They'll kill all the men, throw
the babies from the city walls.

912
01:43:59,766 --> 01:44:02,041
- Please.
- The women, they'll take as slaves.

913
01:44:02,206 --> 01:44:05,915
- That, for you, will be worse than dying.
- Why are you saying such things?

914
01:44:07,486 --> 01:44:09,124
Because I want you to be ready.

915
01:44:09,886 --> 01:44:13,879
I want you to get our boy,
and I want you to bring him here.

916
01:44:14,086 --> 01:44:18,443
You save as many people as you can,
but you get here. And you run.

917
01:44:24,926 --> 01:44:26,598
I killed a boy today.

918
01:44:28,446 --> 01:44:30,038
And he was young.

919
01:44:31,166 --> 01:44:32,918
He was much too young.

920
01:45:01,326 --> 01:45:03,886
That boy has just saved this war for us.

921
01:46:33,806 --> 01:46:35,876
- Eudorus.
- My lord.

922
01:46:36,046 --> 01:46:37,718
I need my armor.

923
01:47:36,166 --> 01:47:37,679
No.

924
01:47:39,006 --> 01:47:40,200
Don't go!

925
01:47:40,846 --> 01:47:42,962
Rope!

926
01:47:43,126 --> 01:47:45,401
Hector's my cousin. He's a good man.

927
01:47:45,566 --> 01:47:48,603
Don't fight him. Please don't fight him.

928
01:47:49,006 --> 01:47:50,837
Please.

929
01:48:43,206 --> 01:48:44,480
No.

930
01:49:09,526 --> 01:49:11,437
Hector!

931
01:49:17,406 --> 01:49:19,044
Hector!

932
01:49:26,646 --> 01:49:28,523
Hector!

933
01:49:33,326 --> 01:49:34,759
Hector!

934
01:49:38,446 --> 01:49:40,323
Father...

935
01:49:40,486 --> 01:49:42,761
...forgive me for any offenses.

936
01:49:44,446 --> 01:49:46,676
I've served you as best as I could.

937
01:49:47,246 --> 01:49:48,838
Hector!

938
01:49:52,966 --> 01:49:55,241
May the gods be with you.

939
01:49:59,366 --> 01:50:00,924
Hector.

940
01:50:03,246 --> 01:50:06,443
No father ever had a better son.

941
01:50:12,846 --> 01:50:14,359
Hector!

942
01:50:16,166 --> 01:50:17,804
Apollo guard you, my prince.

943
01:50:24,686 --> 01:50:26,119
You're the best man I know.

944
01:50:32,086 --> 01:50:33,883
You're a prince of Troy.

945
01:50:34,606 --> 01:50:36,085
I know you'll make me proud.

946
01:50:43,486 --> 01:50:46,046
Hector!

947
01:51:02,366 --> 01:51:04,436
Remember what I told you.

948
01:51:05,206 --> 01:51:08,084
You don't have to go. You don't.

949
01:51:08,366 --> 01:51:10,084
You remember what I told you.

950
01:51:27,646 --> 01:51:29,955
Hector!

951
01:51:44,846 --> 01:51:47,314
Hector!

952
01:52:58,766 --> 01:53:01,326
I've seen this moment in my dreams.

953
01:53:03,326 --> 01:53:04,645
I'll make a pact with you.

954
01:53:05,526 --> 01:53:07,562
With the gods as our witnesses...

955
01:53:07,726 --> 01:53:12,197
...let us pledge that the winner will allow
the loser all the proper funeral rituals.

956
01:53:12,366 --> 01:53:15,244
There are no pacts
between lions and men.

957
01:53:22,926 --> 01:53:25,121
Now you know who you're fighting.

958
01:53:33,286 --> 01:53:36,005
I thought it was you
I was fighting yesterday.

959
01:53:36,326 --> 01:53:40,160
And I wish it had been you. But I gave
the dead boy the honor he deserved.

960
01:53:40,326 --> 01:53:42,237
You gave him the honor of your sword.

961
01:53:42,806 --> 01:53:45,957
You won't have eyes tonight.
You won't have ears or a tongue.

962
01:53:46,126 --> 01:53:50,119
You'll wander the underworld, blind, deaf,
and dumb, and all the dead will know:

963
01:53:50,286 --> 01:53:53,961
This is Hector, the fool who thought
he killed Achilles.

964
01:55:47,086 --> 01:55:48,360
Get up, prince of Troy.

965
01:55:50,886 --> 01:55:53,719
Get up. I won't let
a stone take my glory.

966
01:59:19,886 --> 01:59:21,683
You lost your cousin.

967
01:59:23,446 --> 01:59:25,198
Now you've taken mine.

968
01:59:28,526 --> 01:59:30,084
When does it end?

969
01:59:31,926 --> 01:59:33,678
It never ends.

970
02:00:28,566 --> 02:00:30,079
Who are you?

971
02:00:30,246 --> 02:00:35,878
I have endured what no one
on earth has endured before.

972
02:00:36,526 --> 02:00:41,600
I kissed the hands of the man
who killed my son.

973
02:00:48,366 --> 02:00:49,958
Priam?

974
02:00:51,286 --> 02:00:52,605
How did you get in here?

975
02:00:52,766 --> 02:00:56,554
I know my own country better
than the Greeks, I think.

976
02:01:00,846 --> 02:01:03,201
You're a brave man.

977
02:01:06,126 --> 02:01:09,163
I could have your head on a spit
in the blink of an eye.

978
02:01:09,526 --> 02:01:13,155
Do you really think death
frightens me now?

979
02:01:14,846 --> 02:01:17,314
I watched my eldest son die...

980
02:01:17,486 --> 02:01:21,195
...watched you drag his body
behind your chariot.

981
02:01:23,966 --> 02:01:26,036
Give him back to me.

982
02:01:27,086 --> 02:01:30,999
He deserves the honor of a proper burial.
You know that.

983
02:01:32,326 --> 02:01:34,442
Give him to me.

984
02:01:34,926 --> 02:01:36,518
He killed my cousin.

985
02:01:36,686 --> 02:01:38,597
He thought it was you.

986
02:01:41,086 --> 02:01:43,680
How many cousins have you killed?

987
02:01:45,166 --> 02:01:48,875
How many sons and fathers
and brothers and husbands?

988
02:01:49,166 --> 02:01:51,555
How many, brave Achilles?

989
02:01:53,446 --> 02:01:55,437
I knew your father.

990
02:01:56,526 --> 02:01:58,756
He died before his time.

991
02:01:59,966 --> 02:02:04,960
But he was lucky not to live long enough
to see his son fall.

992
02:02:09,646 --> 02:02:12,206
You have taken everything from me.

993
02:02:14,486 --> 02:02:15,965
My eldest son...

994
02:02:16,606 --> 02:02:18,324
...heir to my throne...

995
02:02:18,766 --> 02:02:20,643
...defender of my kingdom.

996
02:02:22,566 --> 02:02:27,037
I cannot change what happened.
It is the will of the gods.

997
02:02:28,286 --> 02:02:31,483
But give me this small mercy.

998
02:02:33,486 --> 02:02:37,161
I loved my boy from the moment
he opened his eyes...

999
02:02:37,326 --> 02:02:40,363
...till the moment you closed them.

1000
02:02:42,686 --> 02:02:45,564
Let me wash his body.

1001
02:02:47,086 --> 02:02:50,203
Let me say the prayers.

1002
02:02:51,406 --> 02:02:56,082
Let me place two coins on his eyes
for the boatman.

1003
02:03:00,686 --> 02:03:02,836
If I let you walk out of here...

1004
02:03:05,046 --> 02:03:06,923
...if I let you take him...

1005
02:03:09,446 --> 02:03:11,402
...it doesn't change anything.

1006
02:03:12,926 --> 02:03:15,486
You're still my enemy in the morning.

1007
02:03:16,566 --> 02:03:19,478
You're still my enemy tonight.

1008
02:03:20,486 --> 02:03:23,922
But even enemies can show respect.

1009
02:03:42,806 --> 02:03:44,205
I admire your courage.

1010
02:03:51,566 --> 02:03:53,284
Meet me outside in a moment.

1011
02:04:34,366 --> 02:04:36,084
We'll meet again soon, my brother.

1012
02:04:53,726 --> 02:04:56,035
Your son was the best I've fought.

1013
02:04:59,126 --> 02:05:01,686
In my country, the funeral games
last for 12 days.

1014
02:05:02,206 --> 02:05:04,037
It is the same in my country.

1015
02:05:04,206 --> 02:05:06,276
Then the prince will have that honor.

1016
02:05:06,446 --> 02:05:09,802
No Greek will attack Troy for 12 days.

1017
02:05:15,686 --> 02:05:17,005
Briseis?

1018
02:05:19,966 --> 02:05:22,241
I thought you were dead.

1019
02:05:32,486 --> 02:05:33,760
You are free.

1020
02:05:47,686 --> 02:05:49,324
If I hurt you...

1021
02:05:51,406 --> 02:05:53,556
...it's not what I wanted.

1022
02:06:07,606 --> 02:06:09,085
Go.

1023
02:06:09,246 --> 02:06:12,283
No one will stop you.
You have my word.

1024
02:06:13,046 --> 02:06:14,604
Come, my girl.

1025
02:06:22,646 --> 02:06:26,355
You're a far better king than the one
leading this army.

1026
02:06:42,206 --> 02:06:46,563
Achilles makes a secret pact, and I
have to honor it? What treason is this?

1027
02:06:46,726 --> 02:06:50,765
Consorting with the enemy king.
Giving him 12 days of peace.

1028
02:06:50,926 --> 02:06:52,962
Peace!

1029
02:06:53,406 --> 02:06:55,840
Their prince is dead.
Their army is leaderless.

1030
02:06:56,006 --> 02:06:57,758
This is the time to attack!

1031
02:06:57,926 --> 02:07:01,885
Even with Hector gone, we have
no way to breach their walls.

1032
02:07:02,046 --> 02:07:04,640
I will smash their walls to the ground...

1033
02:07:04,806 --> 02:07:07,274
...if it costs me 40,000 Greeks.

1034
02:07:07,446 --> 02:07:09,960
Hear me, Zeus!

1035
02:07:10,126 --> 02:07:14,358
I will smash their walls to the ground.

1036
02:07:26,846 --> 02:07:28,199
That's good.

1037
02:07:28,566 --> 02:07:30,397
For my son back home.

1038
02:07:54,926 --> 02:07:56,405
Well, Odysseus.

1039
02:07:57,366 --> 02:08:01,837
You found a way to make the sheep
invite the wolves to dinner.

1040
02:08:16,846 --> 02:08:20,361
Forgive me, Eudorus.
I should never have struck you.

1041
02:08:21,606 --> 02:08:24,564
You've been a loyal friend all your life.

1042
02:08:26,126 --> 02:08:28,686
I hope I never disappoint you again.

1043
02:08:29,006 --> 02:08:31,395
It's I who have been the disappointment.

1044
02:08:33,006 --> 02:08:35,566
Rouse the men.
You're taking them home.

1045
02:08:36,046 --> 02:08:37,798
Aren't you coming with us?

1046
02:08:38,566 --> 02:08:40,682
I have my own battle to fight.

1047
02:08:41,166 --> 02:08:42,758
Let me march beside you.

1048
02:08:42,926 --> 02:08:46,999
No. I don't want our men
to be a part of this.

1049
02:08:52,446 --> 02:08:54,198
It's a beautiful night.

1050
02:08:54,846 --> 02:08:58,043
Go, Eudorus.
This is the last order I give you.

1051
02:09:03,526 --> 02:09:06,518
Fighting for you has been
my life's honor, my lord.

1052
02:10:13,086 --> 02:10:14,838
Open the gates!

1053
02:10:28,606 --> 02:10:30,198
Here.

1054
02:10:55,486 --> 02:10:57,078
Plague.

1055
02:10:57,726 --> 02:11:00,194
Don't go too close, my king.

1056
02:11:00,766 --> 02:11:02,916
This is the will of the gods.

1057
02:11:03,086 --> 02:11:05,077
They desecrated the temple of Apollo...

1058
02:11:05,246 --> 02:11:07,919
...and Apollo desecrated their flesh.

1059
02:11:08,086 --> 02:11:11,874
They thought they could come here
and sack our city in a day.

1060
02:11:12,046 --> 02:11:15,721
Now look at them,
fleeing across the Aegean.

1061
02:11:19,126 --> 02:11:20,844
What is this?

1062
02:11:21,006 --> 02:11:25,682
An offering to Poseidon. The Greeks
are praying for a safe return home.

1063
02:11:25,966 --> 02:11:30,676
This is a gift. We should take it
to the temple of Poseidon.

1064
02:11:31,246 --> 02:11:33,077
- I think we should burn it.
- Burn it?

1065
02:11:33,366 --> 02:11:35,402
My prince, it's a gift to the gods.

1066
02:11:38,606 --> 02:11:40,995
Father, burn it.

1067
02:12:36,366 --> 02:12:37,845
Look at them.

1068
02:12:39,286 --> 02:12:41,641
You'd think their prince had never died.

1069
02:12:43,726 --> 02:12:45,717
You are the prince now.

1070
02:12:46,446 --> 02:12:48,402
Make your brother proud.

1071
02:16:17,046 --> 02:16:18,718
Briseis. Where is she?

1072
02:16:18,886 --> 02:16:21,036
- Where?
- I don't know.

1073
02:16:21,206 --> 02:16:22,878
Please. I have a son.

1074
02:16:23,326 --> 02:16:25,681
Then get him out of Troy.

1075
02:16:39,886 --> 02:16:41,160
Briseis!

1076
02:17:23,886 --> 02:17:26,844
Paris! Andromache!

1077
02:17:28,206 --> 02:17:29,958
Helen. We must go.

1078
02:17:30,126 --> 02:17:31,878
- Where?
- I'll show you. Now. Hurry.

1079
02:17:32,046 --> 02:17:33,764
Paris.

1080
02:17:33,926 --> 02:17:36,360
It's a long way. Quick. We must go now.

1081
02:17:36,526 --> 02:17:38,084
Briseis!

1082
02:17:41,126 --> 02:17:42,844
Paris!

1083
02:17:55,486 --> 02:17:57,158
Let it burn!

1084
02:17:57,326 --> 02:17:59,556
Let Troy burn!

1085
02:17:59,726 --> 02:18:02,923
Burn it! Burn it all!

1086
02:18:03,566 --> 02:18:05,443
Burn Troy!

1087
02:18:05,846 --> 02:18:08,121
Burn Troy!

1088
02:18:08,686 --> 02:18:10,802
It's a long way. Quick.

1089
02:18:14,526 --> 02:18:16,039
- Come.
- I stay.

1090
02:18:16,206 --> 02:18:18,356
- No.
- My father will never abandon the city.

1091
02:18:18,526 --> 02:18:19,845
I can't leave him.

1092
02:18:20,006 --> 02:18:23,362
The city is dead.
They're burning it to the ground.

1093
02:18:24,846 --> 02:18:26,916
- What's your name?
- Aeneas.

1094
02:18:27,086 --> 02:18:29,964
- Do you know how to use a sword?
- Yes.

1095
02:18:30,126 --> 02:18:32,037
The sword of Troy.

1096
02:18:32,206 --> 02:18:35,596
As long as it's in the hands of a Trojan,
our people have a future.

1097
02:18:35,766 --> 02:18:38,234
Protect them, Aeneas.
Find them a new home.

1098
02:18:38,446 --> 02:18:40,038
- I will.
- Hurry.

1099
02:18:40,926 --> 02:18:43,235
Paris, Briseis wasn't in her room.

1100
02:18:43,406 --> 02:18:44,839
I'll find her.

1101
02:18:47,166 --> 02:18:48,758
Go.

1102
02:18:49,486 --> 02:18:51,078
- I'll stay with you.
- Go.

1103
02:18:51,246 --> 02:18:52,565
Please don't leave me.

1104
02:18:52,726 --> 02:18:54,637
How could you love me if I ran now?

1105
02:18:54,806 --> 02:18:59,243
We will be together again, in this world
or the next. We will be together.

1106
02:19:05,446 --> 02:19:07,004
Go.

1107
02:19:10,446 --> 02:19:12,516
To the gate!

1108
02:19:23,326 --> 02:19:25,237
Soldiers of Troy...

1109
02:19:25,526 --> 02:19:27,721
...you men are warriors!

1110
02:19:27,886 --> 02:19:30,446
To lead you has been my honor!

1111
02:19:31,606 --> 02:19:33,756
My prince!

1112
02:19:34,766 --> 02:19:36,643
The boatman waits for us.

1113
02:19:36,846 --> 02:19:40,202
I say we make him wait a little longer!

1114
02:20:01,006 --> 02:20:02,359
Paris!

1115
02:20:02,846 --> 02:20:04,723
Paris!

1116
02:20:39,766 --> 02:20:41,597
Have you no honor?

1117
02:20:42,526 --> 02:20:44,164
Have you no honor?

1118
02:21:14,606 --> 02:21:17,040
Too late for prayer, priestess.

1119
02:21:24,726 --> 02:21:28,196
I almost lost this war
because of your little romance.

1120
02:21:39,566 --> 02:21:43,400
You'll be my slave in Mycenae.

1121
02:21:43,566 --> 02:21:47,718
A Trojan priestess scrubbing my floors.

1122
02:21:49,686 --> 02:21:50,960
And at night...

1123
02:22:04,006 --> 02:22:05,598
Get up!

1124
02:22:08,766 --> 02:22:10,563
Hold her.

1125
02:22:18,366 --> 02:22:19,640
Come with me.

1126
02:22:23,206 --> 02:22:24,685
No!

1127
02:22:29,806 --> 02:22:32,798
Paris!

1128
02:22:36,006 --> 02:22:37,280
No!

1129
02:22:47,406 --> 02:22:50,284
Stop! Please!

1130
02:22:55,606 --> 02:22:57,836
Paris! Don't!

1131
02:23:22,726 --> 02:23:24,079
It's all right.

1132
02:23:24,686 --> 02:23:26,483
It's all right.

1133
02:23:41,206 --> 02:23:43,083
You gave me peace...

1134
02:23:44,846 --> 02:23:46,802
...in a lifetime of war.

1135
02:23:51,966 --> 02:23:53,479
Briseis, come.

1136
02:23:53,686 --> 02:23:55,119
Go.

1137
02:23:56,126 --> 02:23:57,400
You must.

1138
02:23:57,846 --> 02:23:59,279
No.

1139
02:23:59,606 --> 02:24:01,198
Troy is falling.

1140
02:24:01,766 --> 02:24:03,518
Go.

1141
02:24:06,846 --> 02:24:09,963
We must go. I know a way out.

1142
02:24:14,046 --> 02:24:15,320
It's all right.

1143
02:24:17,726 --> 02:24:19,364
Go.

1144
02:24:24,246 --> 02:24:26,555
Briseis, come.

1145
02:24:26,726 --> 02:24:28,523
Go.

1146
02:25:54,486 --> 02:25:56,044
Find peace...

1147
02:25:56,966 --> 02:25:58,399
...my brother.

1148
02:26:10,766 --> 02:26:15,203
<i>If they ever tell my story, let them say...</i>

1149
02:26:15,366 --> 02:26:17,755
<i>... i walked with giants.</i>

1150
02:26:18,406 --> 02:26:21,716
<i>Men rise and fall like the winter wheat...</i>

1151
02:26:21,926 --> 02:26:24,281
<i>... but these names will never die.</i>

1152
02:26:26,246 --> 02:26:29,716
<i>Let them say i lived</i>
<i>in the time of Hector...</i>

1153
02:26:29,886 --> 02:26:31,922
<i>... tamer of horses.</i>

1154
02:26:32,326 --> 02:26:34,157
<i>Let them say...</i>

1155
02:26:34,326 --> 02:26:37,841
<i>... i lived in the time of Achilles.</i>

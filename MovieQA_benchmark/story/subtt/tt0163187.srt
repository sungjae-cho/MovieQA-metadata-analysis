I'm late, come on, come on.
I need to bounce some ideas off you.

Hey, Ike!

19
00:01:56,917 --> 00:02:00,087
When are you guys gonna stop
waking me up every morning?

20
00:02:00,187 --> 00:02:02,556
When your column stops
putting me to sleep.

21
00:02:02,623 --> 00:02:05,259
- Funny, funny.
- Yo, Jonah!

22
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:07,394
Fisher, come on!
Are you really not there?

23
00:02:07,461 --> 00:02:09,596
All right, cool.
I'll talk to you later.

24
00:02:09,696 --> 00:02:12,633
Excuse me. I'm thinking of doing
an article about limousines.

25
00:02:12,733 --> 00:02:15,769
What do you think about people
who've never been in one?

26
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:17,638
I don't know people like that.

27
00:02:17,738 --> 00:02:21,608
I need someone to bounce some ideas
off of and get the juices flowing.

28
00:02:21,642 --> 00:02:24,745
I got one hour,
27 minutes, 52 seconds.

29
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:26,780
Hey, Ike! When are you gonna
put me in a column?

30
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:29,750
- When your T-shirts stop shrinking.
- [Woman] Shrinks?

31
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:32,719
-Funny. He's kidding. He's just kidding.
-Oh, forget it.

32
00:02:32,786 --> 00:02:35,989
- Here, give me $5. Give me $2.
- [Woman] No way.

33
00:02:36,089 --> 00:02:38,992
Folks, I got nice shirts here.
Look!

34
00:02:39,092 --> 00:02:41,295

36
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:59,246
So what's in store for us
in tomorrow's column?

00:02:59,313 --> 00:03:02,015
[Groans]
I don't know yet.

38
00:03:03,083 --> 00:03:07,020
I'm, uh, kind of
a last-minute man.

39
00:03:07,087 --> 00:03:10,324
You know, till an hour or two
before deadline, I don't get any ideas.

40
00:03:11,992 --> 00:03:14,595
So you get your ideas
for your column from life.

41
00:03:14,661 --> 00:03:16,597
Start up a conversation with a woman
in a bar.

42
00:03:16,663 --> 00:03:19,333
Attack her dart playing
and try to get a rise out of her...

43
00:03:19,433 --> 00:03:23,003
while you contemplate whether
or not she's worth hitting on.

44
00:03:23,103 --> 00:03:25,806
No, I can't hit on you
till I get an idea.

45
00:03:25,873 --> 00:03:27,641
Wh-- That's flattering.

46
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:30,043
[Ike]
No, you don't understand.

47
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:33,614
I understand. See,
my not responding to you baiting me...

48
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,384
will inspire one of those bitter
diatribes you like to write about women.

49
00:03:37,484 --> 00:03:39,786
[Ike]I don't write bitter diatribes
about women.

50
00:03:39,853 --> 00:03:42,656
- Oh-ho.
- Very often. I could.

51
00:03:42,723 --> 00:03:45,559
Only when the ideas
aren't flowing, huh?

52
00:03:45,626 --> 00:03:47,694
It's so nice to meet you,
one-minute man.

53
00:03:47,794 --> 00:03:50,731
It's last-minute man.

54
00:03:50,831 --> 00:03:53,000
Whatever.

55
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:56,303
Want to hear something funny? For a
good-looking guy, you strike out a lot.

56
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:59,406
- [Bartender] Have you noticed that?
- [Phone Ringing]

57
00:03:59,506 --> 00:04:01,842
- I bet it's your ex-wife.
- [Man] Excuse me.

58
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:03,810
I've seen much worse.

59
00:04:03,877 --> 00:04:06,580
[Bartender]
No, Ike's not here.

60
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:09,716
I say, I've seen much worse.

61
00:04:09,816 --> 00:04:12,319
- I'll tell him when he comes in.
- Excuse me?

62
00:04:12,386 --> 00:04:15,255
The brush-off.

63
00:04:15,322 --> 00:04:18,058
I've witnessed far more...

64
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:21,195
treacherous and nefarious exits
than that.

65
00:04:22,296 --> 00:04:24,765
At least she castigated you
in private.

66
00:04:24,865 --> 00:04:28,368
Not as private as I thought.
Kevin, you got some napkins there?

67
00:04:28,435 --> 00:04:32,272
- Wiping or writing?
- I'll let you know.

68
00:04:32,339 --> 00:04:35,275
They love you.
They hate you.

69
00:04:35,342 --> 00:04:37,878
They're hot.
They're cold. They're high.

70
00:04:37,945 --> 00:04:39,913
They're up. They're down.

71
00:04:39,947 --> 00:04:43,584
This is fun making a list with you,
but I do have a column to write.

72
00:04:43,684 --> 00:04:45,452
Ike.

73
00:04:45,552 --> 00:04:49,556
But you have yet to find
a really superb idea.

74
00:04:49,623 --> 00:04:53,026
There's a girl from my hometown
that you could write about.

75
00:04:53,093 --> 00:04:55,028
Excuse me,
but we don't need any ideas.

76
00:04:55,095 --> 00:04:58,632
She likes to dump grooms at the altar.
They call her the "Runaway Bride."

77
00:04:58,732 --> 00:05:01,735
She's performed the travesty
seven or eight times.

78
00:05:01,802 --> 00:05:05,439
Turns around, runs like hell.
Bolts. Adios.

79
00:05:05,472 --> 00:05:08,141
Plows down the aisle,
knocking old ladies out of her way...

80
00:05:08,242 --> 00:05:11,044
Like the Running of the Bulls
in Pamplona.

81
00:05:11,111 --> 00:05:13,580
And guess what!
She's got the next victim all lined up.

82
00:05:13,647 --> 00:05:16,783
She's turning another body
on the spit.

83
00:05:16,884 --> 00:05:19,987
[Ike]
Okay, Italics, here we go.

84
00:05:22,422 --> 00:05:26,660
[Ike's Voice] Today is
a day of profound introspection.

85
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:29,596
I have been accused
of using this column...

86
00:05:29,663 --> 00:05:33,800
to direct bitter diatribes
at the opposite sex.

87
00:05:33,901 --> 00:05:36,970
This uncomfortable accusation...

88
00:05:37,004 --> 00:05:41,241
has plunged me into at least 15 minutes
of serious reflection,

89
00:05:41,308 --> 00:05:43,410
from which I have emerged...

90
00:05:43,477 --> 00:05:48,782
with the conclusion that, yes,
I traffic in female stereotypes.

91
00:05:50,817 --> 00:05:54,321
"But how can one blame me when
every time I step out my front door,

92
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:58,525
I meet fresh proof that the female
archetypes are alive and well."

93
00:05:58,625 --> 00:06:02,129
"The mother, the virgin,
the whore, the crone."

94
00:06:02,196 --> 00:06:05,098
"They're elbowing you in the subway,
stealing your cabs,

95
00:06:05,165 --> 00:06:07,835
and overwhelming you
with perfume in elevators."

96
00:06:07,935 --> 00:06:09,870
"But perhaps in fairness
to the fairer sex,

97
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:14,141
I do need to broaden my horizon and add
some new goddesses to the pantheon."

98
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:18,178
"I would like to nominate
for deity the cheerleader, the coed...

99
00:06:18,278 --> 00:06:21,281
and the man-eater, the last
of which concerns me most today."

100
00:06:21,348 --> 00:06:24,718
"In ancient Greece, this fearsome female
was known as Erinys,

101
00:06:24,785 --> 00:06:26,787
the devouring death goddess."

102
00:06:26,854 --> 00:06:28,522
"In India, she is Kali,

103
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:31,058
who likes to devour
her boyfriend Shiva's entrails..."

104
00:06:31,158 --> 00:06:33,861
"while her yoni devours
his dot, dot, dot... never mind."

105
00:06:33,961 --> 00:06:38,999
"In Indonesia, the bloody-jawed man-eater
is called Ragma."

106
00:06:39,066 --> 00:06:42,469
You notice these are
all countries without cable.

107
00:06:42,536 --> 00:06:44,905
"And in Hale, Maryland,

the family hardware store,

she is known as Miss Maggie Carpenter,
a.k.a. the Runaway Bride."

"What is unusual about
Miss Carpenter...

111
00:06:54,882 --> 00:06:59,353
is that she likes to dress her men up
as grooms before she devours them."

made between 1924 and 1938.

115
00:07:11,865 --> 00:07:13,901
In other words,
Mr. Paxton,

116
00:07:14,001 --> 00:07:16,036
I think you are out of the doghouse
with Mrs. Paxton.

she hasn't seen this yet.

[Radio] On the local front,
our town of Hale, Maryland,

00:08:47,261 --> 00:08:49,696

00:08:49,796 --> 00:08:52,399
about their native daughter,
Maggie Carpenter.

145

Her bridal exploits were taken
to task...

146
00:08:54,668 --> 00:08:57,271
by New York columnist
Ike Graham in USA Today.

00:08:59,506 --> 00:09:02,976
[Maggie's Voice]
Dear Editor: Greetings from the sticks.

149
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:07,014
Perhaps you believe that
a rural education is focused mainly...

150
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:11,318
on hog calling and tractor maintenance
rather than reading.

151
00:09:11,385 --> 00:09:13,353
Why else would you print a piece
of fiction about me and call it fact?

152
00:09:13,353 --> 00:09:15,222
Why else would you print a piece
of fiction about me and call it fact?

153
00:09:18,392 --> 00:09:21,295
I suppose Mr. Graham was too busy
thinking up slanderous statements...

154
00:09:21,361 --> 00:09:23,363
about how I dump men for kicks...

155
00:09:23,397 --> 00:09:26,233
to bother with something silly
like accuracy in reporting.

156
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:29,236
Which is understandable, because
with a man-eater like me on the loose,

157
00:09:29,336 --> 00:09:31,238
who has time to check facts?

158
00:09:31,338 --> 00:09:34,174
- Hey, Frances, lunch today?
- No, I'm going to the bank.

159
00:09:34,241 --> 00:09:36,176
- Sure?
- Sorry, Ike.

160
00:09:36,243 --> 00:09:39,479
- All right. Hey.
- Hey.

161
00:09:39,546 --> 00:09:41,682
I'm going to put in
a good word for you.

162
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:42,883
Don't mention my name.

163
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:44,918

That's why I was surprised to find...

164
00:09:44,985 --> 00:09:47,254
Mr. Graham's editor was a woman.

00:09:47,354 --> 00:09:50,591
Call me a sentimental fool, but I hoped
we man-eaters could stick together.

-Ellie asked me to offer moral support.

need moral support?

If you fabricate your facts,
you get fired.

Never work for your former spouse.

That has nothing to do with it. You
cooked this story up, and you know it!

331
00:19:51,091 --> 00:19:54,161
In my heart,
I feel I'm right about you.

332
00:19:54,261 --> 00:19:55,829
Mmm.

333
00:19:55,929 --> 00:19:57,965
You got me fired, lady.

334
00:19:58,031 --> 00:20:02,803
You destroyed my reputation,
and you screwed up my hair.

335
00:20:02,836 --> 00:20:05,806
You chew up men,
spit 'em out and love it.

336
00:20:05,873 --> 00:20:09,042
You're gonna do the same thing
to this poor schmuck number four...

337
00:20:09,142 --> 00:20:11,612
that you did
to the previous three.

338
00:20:11,645 --> 00:20:13,614
You're gonna run again.

339
00:20:13,647 --> 00:20:15,883
And I'm not leaving until you do.

340
00:20:17,317 --> 00:20:21,688
I'd love to stay and chat,
but I still have my job.

341
00:20:28,529 --> 00:20:31,064
Hey, kid, kid, kid,
wait a minute.

342
00:20:31,164 --> 00:20:33,133
- Give you ten bucks for the hat.
- Sure!

343
00:20:33,166 --> 00:20:35,802
That's right.

344
00:20:39,673 --> 00:20:41,675
Sheesh.

[Bob Chuckles]

346
00:20:51,218 --> 00:20:54,388
I'm telling you,
that is a photo opportunity.

347
00:20:54,488 --> 00:20:58,091
When I only see one dog,
I know I've had too much to drink.

348
00:20:59,826 --> 00:21:01,929
Hey, you'll never guess...

349
00:21:02,029 --> 00:21:06,400
who came crawling into town
with his tail between his legs.

350
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,402
[Walter]
Who?

351
00:21:08,502 --> 00:21:10,571
Hello, Maggie.

352
00:21:10,671 --> 00:21:14,208
[Ike] I just came over
to apologize to your family.

353
00:21:14,274 --> 00:21:16,543
When I'm wrong, I'm wrong.

354
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:19,379
I pushed a story.
I made a mistake.

355
00:21:19,446 --> 00:21:24,718
In other words, he's only human.
And he brought us a bottle of wine.

356
00:21:24,785 --> 00:21:28,589
-Made me put my hat back on.
-Yeah. It scared the hell outta Skipper.

357
00:21:28,689 --> 00:21:30,357
[Barks]

358
00:21:30,424 --> 00:21:32,626
You've gotta be kidding me.

359
00:21:32,726 --> 00:21:35,062
No, no. You should've seen Skipper.
He was like-- [Barks]

[Howls]

361
00:21:41,301 --> 00:21:43,470
It wasn't that... funny.

362
00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:46,406
Actually, it's been quite amusing.

363
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:50,277
Walter, here, has been sharing his
father of the bride wedding memories.

364
00:21:50,377 --> 00:21:52,946
You know what?

365
00:21:53,046 --> 00:21:56,950
I think I'll take this to the kitchen.
[Mouthing Words]

366
00:21:57,050 --> 00:22:00,888
I'll help you bring it in...
to the kitchen.

367
00:22:00,921 --> 00:22:03,156
- Check on the crabs, Bob.
- Okay.

368
00:22:03,257 --> 00:22:05,592
-[Whispers] Is he staying for dinner?
-I don't know.

369
00:22:05,626 --> 00:22:09,296
I hope they don't have a fight. You
don't think they'd call it off, do you?

370
00:22:09,396 --> 00:22:13,767
Wedding cake freezes. This we know.
[Chuckles]

371
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:18,305
- You know, your daughter is such--
- [Gasps] Oh, I'm sorry.

372
00:22:18,405 --> 00:22:20,974
No, no, that's all right,
Grandma. That's fine.

373
00:22:21,074 --> 00:22:23,010
She's such a lovely girl.

374
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:25,946
Yeah. Well,
like her mother. Look.

375
00:22:26,013 --> 00:22:28,315
May she rest in peace.

376
00:22:28,415 --> 00:22:31,285
We were all so proud of Maggie
when she was in school.

377
00:22:31,318 --> 00:22:34,821
She won that American Legion
scholarship to college.

378
00:22:34,922 --> 00:22:36,657
She studied industrial design.

379
00:22:36,757 --> 00:22:40,494
I can't see her leaving multiple grooms
in the dust like that.

380
00:22:40,594 --> 00:22:43,497
Oh, yes, you can.
She's got it all on tape.

381
00:22:44,798 --> 00:22:48,635
- Tape?
- Yeah, they're all right there.

382
00:22:48,669 --> 00:22:50,971
You got tapes of the wedding?

383
00:22:51,004 --> 00:22:53,106
Lee, at the hotel,
videos weddings.

384
00:22:53,173 --> 00:22:58,378
Course Maggie didn't know she was
gonna be running the 100-yarddash.

385
00:22:58,478 --> 00:23:02,149
- I gotta say, she makes real good time.
- Bingo!

386
00:23:02,216 --> 00:23:04,852
Maggie may not be
Hale's longest running joke,

387
00:23:04,952 --> 00:23:06,854
but she is certainly the fastest.

388
00:23:06,954 --> 00:23:09,690
Ha, ha.

389
00:23:12,359 --> 00:23:15,662
Maggie's mom and I
were only blessed with one child,

390
00:23:15,696 --> 00:23:17,698
not for a lack of trying.

391
00:23:17,798 --> 00:23:19,800
This is good, Dad.
Don't leave anything out.

392
00:23:20,868 --> 00:23:22,870
I consider it a bonus...

394
00:23:25,672 --> 00:23:29,309
that I'm actually able to plan
and pay for so many weddings.

395
00:23:29,376 --> 00:23:31,712
Not this one.
This one's on me.

396
00:23:31,812 --> 00:23:34,414
Oh! That's fair.

397
00:23:34,515 --> 00:23:38,685
I don't do it on purpose, and
I have no intentions of doing it again.

398
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:41,588
That's right, Maggie.
Just keep your eye on the ball.

Bob is the head of
the P.E. department at the high school.

401
00:23:51,765 --> 00:23:55,435
And he coaches the football team.
And he's climbed Everest.

402
00:23:57,538 --> 00:24:00,274
- Everest? Is it true?
- [Maggie] Twice.

404
00:24:02,209 --> 00:24:05,345
- My girl, she likes to brag about me.
- I do.

Maggie's training
for our wedding night.

406
00:24:09,583 --> 00:24:12,186
I'm taking her trekking on Annapurna
for our honeymoon.

- Oh, how romantic!
- We think so.

408

with two Sherpas and a yak.

I'll never hide
when she's by my side.

The horse seems more jittery
than the bride.

I like the white tuxedo.

00:27:57,010 --> 00:27:59,313

'cause he's too blond.

00:30:28,929 --> 00:30:31,164
Ike just dropped by
to check out the team.

497
00:30:31,265 --> 00:30:32,933
And to talk about you!

498
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,801
- Ahh!
- Yes!

499
00:30:34,902 --> 00:30:37,337
You aren't making friends
with this man, are you?

500
00:30:37,404 --> 00:30:40,774
I'm just bragging
about how good you are.

501
00:30:40,841 --> 00:30:44,278
- And how I'm the luckiest man alive.
- Mm-hmm!

502
00:30:45,445 --> 00:30:47,147
Sweetie.

503
00:30:47,181 --> 00:30:50,684
Well, I better be moving.

504
00:30:50,784 --> 00:30:53,187
Got a lot of work to do today.

505
00:30:53,253 --> 00:30:55,656
- See you two lovebirds later.
- See you at the weddin'.

506
00:30:55,689 --> 00:30:59,626
- Yeah. Thanks for the jacket.
- You invited him to the wedding?

507
00:30:59,693 --> 00:31:03,697
% Go, go, Comets
Let's go %

508
00:31:03,797 --> 00:31:05,999
Don't you realize he's writing
another article about me?

509
00:31:06,033 --> 00:31:06,867
Sure.

510
00:31:06,967 --> 00:31:12,639
But you're not runnin'. Come on. Give
me some of that homemade sunshine.

511
00:31:12,706 --> 00:31:17,444
Boys, take my princess
for a ride on her chariot.

512
00:31:17,511 --> 00:31:19,346
Oh, my--
[Laughing]

513
00:31:25,719 --> 00:31:27,988
Bless me, Father,
for I have sinned.

514
00:31:28,055 --> 00:31:32,526
My last confession was--
Well, anyway.

515
00:31:32,626 --> 00:31:35,362
I have sort of
a technical question.

516
00:31:35,462 --> 00:31:38,498
I've been having bad thoughts.

517
00:31:38,565 --> 00:31:41,401
Reallybadthoughts.

518
00:31:41,502 --> 00:31:44,371
- Of an impure nature?
- No, no.

519
00:31:44,404 --> 00:31:50,344
I want to destroy this man's life,
career, everything. I want revenge!

520
00:31:50,410 --> 00:31:53,747
Now, on the sin scale,
howbadis that?

521
00:31:53,847 --> 00:31:57,150
Can I... "Hail Mary"
my way out of that?

522
00:31:57,217 --> 00:32:00,754
-My child, any sin in one's heart is a--
-The name is Maggie.

523
00:32:00,854 --> 00:32:03,390
It was this side of ten years ago
you had your tongue down my throat.

524
00:32:03,490 --> 00:32:06,527
So don't "my child" me, Brian, okay?
It annoys me.

525
00:32:06,593 --> 00:32:08,996
Maggie, don't get so upset.

526
00:32:09,062 --> 00:32:12,232
Hey, hey! Don't-- Brian, talk to me.
I need to talk to you.

527
00:32:12,332 --> 00:32:13,834
Maggie, Maggie, Maggie.

528
00:32:13,901 --> 00:32:16,570
You're not even Catholic
so you really shouldn't be here.

529
00:32:16,670 --> 00:32:20,607
I'm sorry. I'm just so stressed out
about this slimeball reporter.

530
00:32:20,674 --> 00:32:23,610
And I wanted to come and tell you
that he might stop by here...

531
00:32:23,677 --> 00:32:26,013
and ask you all kinds
of ridiculous questions.

532
00:32:26,079 --> 00:32:29,049
Well, he only actually asked me
one ridiculous question.

533
00:32:29,116 --> 00:32:31,084
The rest weren't so bad.

534
00:32:31,118 --> 00:32:34,788
What? Oh, you talked to him?

535
00:32:34,888 --> 00:32:38,225
Did you tell him
we dated before you were a priest?

536
00:32:38,292 --> 00:32:41,795
Of course.
I think I only did you good.

537
00:32:41,895 --> 00:32:44,131
W-What exactly did he ask?

538
00:32:44,231 --> 00:32:47,768
- Am I too late, Father?
- No, no.

539
00:32:47,801 --> 00:32:51,305
- It won't take long. Just two venials.
- Okay.

540
00:32:51,405 --> 00:32:53,874
Um, just respectful things.

541
00:32:53,941 --> 00:32:57,277
What kind of music did you like?
What did we have in common?

542
00:32:57,377 --> 00:33:01,448
Did you ruin my life
when you left me at the altar?

543
00:33:01,548 --> 00:33:03,984
Uh, what did you say?

544
00:33:04,084 --> 00:33:06,553
I said, you know,
how could I be angry...

545
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:11,625
when this is clearly as God
intended for it to be for me?

546
00:33:11,758 --> 00:33:14,094
Good one! Thanks.

547
00:33:14,161 --> 00:33:19,066
But, actually,
it's, it's really, really how I feel.

548
00:33:21,735 --> 00:33:23,136
Of course. God, yes.

549
00:33:23,237 --> 00:33:25,239
Not... [Whispers] God.

550
00:33:25,305 --> 00:33:26,773
[Whispers]
Sorry.

551
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:29,076
I better go.
The man is a lunatic.

552
00:33:29,142 --> 00:33:31,979
But I think I know exactly
where he's going next.

553
00:33:32,079 --> 00:33:33,981
[Whispering]
God bless.

554
00:33:35,415 --> 00:33:37,651
Oh! Purse.

555
00:33:37,751 --> 00:33:40,787
Forgot my purse.

556
00:33:40,854 --> 00:33:43,190
Hi, sorry. Purse.

557
00:33:43,290 --> 00:33:45,492
Good luck.

558
00:33:45,592 --> 00:33:48,295
What was the one ridiculous question
that he asked?

559
00:33:48,362 --> 00:33:51,465
He wanted to know
how you liked your eggs.

560
00:33:51,532 --> 00:33:53,333
Oh, weird.

561
00:33:53,433 --> 00:33:55,536
Like a person's gonna
remember after all this time.

562
00:33:55,636 --> 00:33:59,606
Scrambled with salt, pepper and dill.
Same as me.

563
00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:06,046
I'm sorry I hurt you, Brian.

564
00:34:07,681 --> 00:34:11,852
Maggie, I'm happy now... here.
It's where I'm supposed to be.

565
00:34:11,952 --> 00:34:16,323
But... if you ever do decide to become
a Catholic, will you do me this favor?

566
00:34:16,390 --> 00:34:18,325
Confess to Father Patrick.

567
00:34:18,392 --> 00:34:20,994
Of course.

568
00:34:35,809 --> 00:34:38,345
- Gill? Lydia?
- Mags!

569
00:34:38,412 --> 00:34:41,181
Hey, look, the tape. Remember?

570
00:34:41,248 --> 00:34:43,217
Radio City Music Hall concert...

571
00:34:43,317 --> 00:34:46,253
when Jerry was on "Ripple,"
and I'm going like, "Dude, let me jam."

572
00:34:46,353 --> 00:34:48,388
- Gill, listen--
- I'll play it for you.

573
00:34:48,488 --> 00:34:51,391
- You remember, Maggie. You were there.
- Can you focus on me?

574
00:34:51,491 --> 00:34:54,228
There's this reporter
who's making my life a living hell.

575
00:34:54,328 --> 00:34:55,662
Okay.

576
00:34:55,729 --> 00:34:58,365
And whatever you do,

577
00:34:58,432 --> 00:35:02,369
do not show him that picture of me
from the concert in San Francisco.

578
00:35:02,436 --> 00:35:04,505
- Okay? Can you--
- [Ike Laughing]

579
00:35:04,571 --> 00:35:08,942
- What is that?
- Uh-- Wait. San Francisco?

580
00:35:09,042 --> 00:35:11,578
But we went there a few times.
There's a lot of pictures.

581
00:35:11,678 --> 00:35:14,681
Which picture? Because one time
we had a flat tire. Remember?

582
00:35:14,748 --> 00:35:16,416
Imagine!

583
00:35:16,517 --> 00:35:21,922
Maggie Carpenter
topless in a public arena.

584
00:35:21,955 --> 00:35:24,625
Mmm. Oh, yeah.

585
00:35:24,725 --> 00:35:27,928
I see it was
a very chilly evening.

586
00:35:27,995 --> 00:35:30,264
Mm-hmm.

587
00:35:33,267 --> 00:35:36,203
What's really interesting
about this, though,

588
00:35:36,270 --> 00:35:40,207
is that you can't see
that rose tattoo...

589
00:35:40,274 --> 00:35:44,044
- on your back.
- [Chuckles]

590
00:35:44,111 --> 00:35:47,781
Oh, yeah. Ike bet me 50 bucks
that you don't still have it.

591
00:35:47,881 --> 00:35:51,218
I said, "You're on, man.
Maggie loved that thing."

592
00:35:51,285 --> 00:35:54,288
And, seriously, I mean,
I could use 50 bucks.

593
00:35:54,388 --> 00:35:57,457
- Mm-hmm.
- Maggie?

594
00:35:57,558 --> 00:35:59,459
Just--

595
00:36:03,263 --> 00:36:05,465
Look, I'm not gonna show
you guys anything.

596
00:36:05,499 --> 00:36:09,303
I am a soon-to-be-married woman.
So just give me the photograph!

597
00:36:09,336 --> 00:36:11,405
I would love to give you this.
Believe me, I would.

598
00:36:11,471 --> 00:36:15,342
Just give us a quick gander
at that rose,

599
00:36:15,442 --> 00:36:17,344
and I'll gladly
turn it over to you.

600
00:36:17,444 --> 00:36:20,247
Fine. Fine. Okay, fine.

601
00:36:21,982 --> 00:36:24,318
Okay? All right?

602
00:36:24,351 --> 00:36:27,120
- [Clears Throat] Satisfied?
- Completely.

603
00:36:27,187 --> 00:36:31,792
- Maggie, you got it removed?
- Gill--

604
00:36:31,859 --> 00:36:35,295
Gill, I'll go you double or nothing
it was a stick on.

605
00:36:37,331 --> 00:36:39,266
Maggie?

606
00:36:43,003 --> 00:36:45,639
Gill, I am...

607
00:36:45,706 --> 00:36:48,509
really, really...

608
00:36:48,609 --> 00:36:51,311
afraid of needles.

609
00:36:51,378 --> 00:36:53,480
- But that doesn't make me a bad person.
- Look.

610
00:36:53,547 --> 00:36:56,517
Look! Look!

611
00:36:56,550 --> 00:36:58,886
I think this man is heartbroken.

612
00:36:58,986 --> 00:37:01,154
- No, he's not.
- I think I am.

613
00:37:02,489 --> 00:37:04,825
No, you're, you're not!

614
00:37:04,892 --> 00:37:08,529
You have your guitar,
and you have Lydia. You're not--

615
00:37:08,629 --> 00:37:11,465
% [Guitar]

616
00:37:11,532 --> 00:37:14,868
We'll talk about this later. Okay?

617
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:22,543
Hey, Ike?

618
00:37:22,643 --> 00:37:25,846
- What would Jerry do?
- He'd play.

619
00:37:25,913 --> 00:37:28,682
-Jerry would play!
- He would play!

620
00:37:41,195 --> 00:37:43,096
Well, there's Ike...

621
00:37:43,197 --> 00:37:45,566
with the mayor
and the police chief.

622
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:47,601
Boy, he sure makes friends easy.

623
00:37:47,668 --> 00:37:50,604
That's pretty cool.

624
00:37:58,245 --> 00:38:00,047
- Oh, yeah!
- That's right!

625
00:38:05,118 --> 00:38:07,588
- Hey, you're that reporter, right?
- Yeah.

626
00:38:07,688 --> 00:38:10,090
There he is again!

627
00:38:10,190 --> 00:38:12,359
Snoop Doggy Dogg!

628
00:38:12,426 --> 00:38:15,629
- I'm going to marry Maggie someday.
- Oh, really?

629
00:38:15,729 --> 00:38:19,099
He's an attractive man.

630
00:38:19,132 --> 00:38:22,870
The vicious reporter is attractive?
You're saying viciousness is attractive?

631
00:38:22,936 --> 00:38:25,105
No, I'm not saying
viciousness is attractive.

632
00:38:28,942 --> 00:38:30,644
He's coming.

633
00:38:30,744 --> 00:38:32,079
I better go--

634
00:38:32,145 --> 00:38:34,648
No, no, no.
Don't leave. Uh, act natural.

635
00:38:34,748 --> 00:38:37,918
- Okay.
- He can probably read lips.

636
00:38:37,985 --> 00:38:41,989
The famous Swenson triplets.
Gimme 15. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well done.

637
00:38:42,089 --> 00:38:45,459
- I will handle this.
- Don't move your lips! Okay? Go on.

638
00:38:45,492 --> 00:38:49,129
I will handle this!
I won't say anything.

639
00:38:49,162 --> 00:38:51,398
- Okay.
- I'll handle it.

640
00:38:53,233 --> 00:38:57,004
Yeah, Cory!

641
00:38:57,104 --> 00:38:59,072
- Hey, Peggy Flemming!
- Hey.

642
00:38:59,139 --> 00:39:01,808
- Not the ice skater.
- That's Maggie's seat.

643
00:39:01,842 --> 00:39:04,478
Yes, and this must be her beer too.

644
00:39:04,578 --> 00:39:06,647
- [Cory]Hey!
- Hey, sweetie!

645
00:39:06,747 --> 00:39:09,650
[Ike]
That your husband out here?

646
00:39:09,750 --> 00:39:12,653
- Yeah.
- This is Cory? Cory Flemming?

647
00:39:12,686 --> 00:39:14,988
He's a radio announcer here,
isn't he?

648
00:39:15,022 --> 00:39:18,425
Yeah, that's right. Have you heard his
morning show, "Wake up with Flemm"?

649
00:39:19,993 --> 00:39:21,929
Not yet.

650
00:39:21,995 --> 00:39:26,433
[Grandma Over P.A.]Now up,
Atlantic Hotel's Lee Mistlehorne.

651
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:28,535
He actually made
the all-stars in high school.

652
00:39:28,635 --> 00:39:30,871
Really?
You must be proud of him.

653
00:39:30,971 --> 00:39:32,873
I didn't really
know him back then.

654
00:39:32,973 --> 00:39:37,811
He was actually dating Maggie...
at the time.

655
00:39:37,878 --> 00:39:42,349
I mean, he never really--
They were never gonna...

656
00:39:42,449 --> 00:39:45,285
get engaged or anything,
it was just like, you know.

657
00:39:45,352 --> 00:39:48,288
Sometimes he'd call her Magpie,
and it was really irritating.

658
00:39:48,355 --> 00:39:51,325
But-- I don't know why
I'm telling you this.

659
00:39:51,391 --> 00:39:52,860
No, this is good.

660
00:39:55,362 --> 00:39:57,664
- He's stealing third!
- Yes!

661
00:39:57,731 --> 00:39:59,466
[Bob]
Safe.

662
00:39:59,533 --> 00:40:02,202

834
00:51:19,813 --> 00:51:21,882
The ring was inside a cocoon.

835
00:51:21,982 --> 00:51:26,386
Ahh. A little too
Silence of the Lambs for my taste, but--

836
00:51:26,486 --> 00:51:29,523
Well, he's an entomologist.
I thought it was very unique.

837
00:51:29,590 --> 00:51:32,359
- And finally, Bob.
- Mmm.

838
00:51:32,426 --> 00:51:34,695
He proposed during
the seventh inning stretch...

839
00:51:36,496 --> 00:51:39,766
at an Oriole game.

840
00:51:39,833 --> 00:51:43,003
Wait, wait.
Wait, don't tell me.

841
00:51:43,070 --> 00:51:46,373
The scoreboard lit up
with "Marry me, Maggie."

842
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:49,109
It was one of the most
wonderful moments of my life.

843
00:51:49,209 --> 00:51:51,612
Highly suspect.

844
00:51:51,678 --> 00:51:54,948
What do you mean?
It was incredibly romantic.

845
00:51:55,015 --> 00:51:58,352
Look, maybe it's just me, but...

846
00:51:58,418 --> 00:52:02,256
if you gotta dress it up like that,
it just doesn't ring true.

847
00:52:02,356 --> 00:52:06,760
You know,
l, I think the most...

848
00:52:06,860 --> 00:52:09,229
that anybody
can honestly say is:

849
00:52:09,296 --> 00:52:14,468
"Look, I guarantee there'll be
tough times. I guarantee...

850
00:52:14,535 --> 00:52:19,306
"at some point one or both of us
is gonna want to get out of this thing.

851
00:52:19,406 --> 00:52:23,710
"But I also guarantee that
if I don't ask you to be mine,

852
00:52:23,777 --> 00:52:26,413
"I'll regret it
the rest of my life.

853
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:30,984
"Because I know in my heart...

854
00:52:32,452 --> 00:52:34,988
you're the only one for me."

855
00:52:38,258 --> 00:52:40,227
I like it.

856
00:52:41,328 --> 00:52:43,630
I'd like it better
on a scoreboard.

857
00:52:46,767 --> 00:52:51,004
So, is that what you said when
you asked your wife to marry you?

858
00:52:51,104 --> 00:52:54,141
Don't look so surprised. You've got
"divorce" written all over you.

859
00:52:55,609 --> 00:52:58,345
I'm a work-in-progress.

860
00:52:58,412 --> 00:53:01,682
So, is that what
you said to her?

861
00:53:01,748 --> 00:53:04,751
No. I think I said
something very eloquent like,

862
00:53:04,818 --> 00:53:07,287
"So, um,

863
00:53:07,354 --> 00:53:10,324
"maybe you and I should,
you know--

864
00:53:10,424 --> 00:53:13,126
What do you think? Huh?''

865
00:53:14,428 --> 00:53:16,697
Now, that's romantic.

866
00:53:16,797 --> 00:53:19,967
And with a proposal like that,
you didn't find eternal bliss?

867
00:53:20,033 --> 00:53:22,870
- [Sighs]
- What went wrong?

868
00:53:22,970 --> 00:53:24,938
I don't know.

869
00:53:24,972 --> 00:53:28,876
- You don't know?
- No.

870
00:53:28,942 --> 00:53:33,013
Maybe you should ask her sometime.
Ever thought of that?

871

872
00:53:42,456 --> 00:53:44,558
[Maggie] Even with
everything that's happened,

873
00:53:44,658 --> 00:53:46,493
I have still never been married.

874
00:53:46,560 --> 00:53:50,163
And I still deserve
a beautiful dress.

875
00:53:52,065 --> 00:53:54,401
- [Doorbells Tinkle]
- Mrs. Whittenmeyer?

876
00:53:54,501 --> 00:53:56,470
Where are you going?

877
00:53:56,503 --> 00:53:58,672
- Hi, Polly.
- Hi, Maggie.

878
00:53:58,739 --> 00:54:01,675
You'll have to excuse her. Some of
the children are afraid of you...

879
00:54:01,742 --> 00:54:04,211
since you dragged
that little boy up the aisle.

880
00:54:04,311 --> 00:54:06,213
Drag-- No.
I didn't, I didn't--

881
00:54:06,313 --> 00:54:08,582
He tripped
on his own shoelaces.

882
00:54:08,682 --> 00:54:11,852
You've come for your dress. Good.
It's in the back. I'll get it.

883
00:54:11,919 --> 00:54:16,657
Actually, Mrs. Whittenmeyer,
I decided...

884
00:54:16,723 --> 00:54:19,593
- that I want to get this dress.
- Oh.

885
00:54:19,660 --> 00:54:22,563
The one you have on hold
is lovely, dear.

886
00:54:22,663 --> 00:54:26,400
I know, but I've just--
I've changed my mind.

887
00:54:26,500 --> 00:54:28,702
This is $ 1 ,000.

888
00:54:28,769 --> 00:54:31,572
And I have $ 1 ,000.

889
00:54:31,672 --> 00:54:34,708
[Mrs. Whittenmeyer]
The other one is only $300, dear.

890
00:54:34,775 --> 00:54:39,112
Um-- Is that dress for sale?

891
00:54:39,213 --> 00:54:43,617
It's just a lot of money to spend
on one of your dresses, Maggie.

892
00:54:43,684 --> 00:54:47,554
After all, you only wear them
for about ten minutes or so.

893
00:54:52,893 --> 00:54:54,862
Um, yeah, yeah.

894
00:54:54,928 --> 00:54:58,098
I guess that's true.

895
00:54:59,900 --> 00:55:03,370
Uh, the other dress is, is nice.

896
00:55:03,403 --> 00:55:05,606
- Mrs. Whittenheimer?
- Meyer.

897
00:55:05,706 --> 00:55:08,375
Whittenmeyer. Could I talk
to you just for a second?

898
00:55:08,442 --> 00:55:10,744
Come here. I don't know much
about this kind of thing.

899
00:55:10,811 --> 00:55:15,282
I'm from out of town.
But you're a salesperson, right?

900
00:55:15,382 --> 00:55:18,485
- You're here to sell wedding dresses.
- I've been here 30 years.

901
00:55:18,552 --> 00:55:22,322
Perfect! Because
Miss Carpenter is here to buy one.

902
00:55:22,389 --> 00:55:25,392
Ah. But not just any one.
She wants that one.

903
00:55:25,425 --> 00:55:28,962
- It's $1,000!
- Listen, Aunt Bee.

for me. Let's try visual, all right?

Now, we'll have
this nice beautiful dress.

it's hers. Okay? All right?

You're reading your newspaper
upside down.

That's gotta
be better than "fine."

Yeah.

I'm gonna have my hair up
somehow.

I don't know.
Maybe with a little in the back.

922
00:56:45,405 --> 00:56:48,342
And, my favorite feature...

923
00:56:48,408 --> 00:56:53,313
is that it kind of swishes
like a bell when I move.

you're ever gonna meet.

But she focuses too much out there.

942
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:48,869
She needs to start
focusing more in here.

No, but I think attraction...

1058

for rightness.

1059

- No.

No, no.
It doesn't mean anything. It means--

What did you call her? A man-eater?

Devouring death goddess.
All right?

1085

I don't think that's why she ran.

He'll tell you what to do.

what to do.

looked great in that suit.

1508
01:31:29,756 --> 01:31:32,426
I'm happy for you, honey.

found out...

any final advice?

Hello, Ike.

1661

Don't tell me my doorman
is one of your many admirers?

1662
01:41:57,050 --> 01:41:59,620
I'm making friends with your cat.

1663
01:42:00,954 --> 01:42:02,890
Is it okay that I'm here?

1664
01:42:02,956 --> 01:42:06,760
I don't have much choice
in the matter, do l?

1665

You here on business?

1672
01:42:25,579 --> 01:42:28,916
By the way, I saw your lamps.

1673
01:42:28,982 --> 01:42:33,086
They're terrific. Yeah, really.

doing here anyway?

1677
01:42:48,669 --> 01:42:52,239
I wanted to talk to you...

1678
01:42:52,306 --> 01:42:57,477
about why I run,

1679
01:42:57,578 --> 01:43:00,814
sometimes ride, away from things.

1680
01:43:03,617 --> 01:43:06,286
- Does it matter?
- I think so.

[Clears Throat]

1682
01:43:08,355 --> 01:43:13,527
When I was walking down the aisle,
I was walking toward somebody...

1683
01:43:13,627 --> 01:43:19,333
who had no idea who I really was.

1684
01:43:19,433 --> 01:43:24,271
And it was only half
the other person's fault...

1685
01:43:24,338 --> 01:43:29,109
because I had done everything
to convince him...

1686
01:43:29,176 --> 01:43:31,278
that I was exactly what he wanted.

1687
01:43:31,345 --> 01:43:34,815
So, it was good...

1688
01:43:34,882 --> 01:43:39,686
that I didn't go through with it
because it would've been a lie.

1689
01:43:39,786 --> 01:43:43,490
But you--

1690
01:43:43,557 --> 01:43:46,026
You knew the real me.

1691
01:43:48,061 --> 01:43:49,997
Yes, I did.

1692
01:43:50,063 --> 01:43:52,566
I didn't.

1693
01:43:53,967 --> 01:43:58,205
Still, I ended up
chasing a truck.

1694
01:44:11,919 --> 01:44:15,856
I can't, um,
do anything about the truck.

1695
01:44:17,824 --> 01:44:19,726
But, uh--

1696
01:44:24,198 --> 01:44:26,900
- Benedict.
- Arnold.

1697
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:29,570
I love eggs Benedict.

1698
01:44:29,670 --> 01:44:32,406
I hate all the other
kinds of eggs.

1699
01:44:32,439 --> 01:44:36,677
I hate big weddings,
everybody staring.

1700
01:44:36,743 --> 01:44:39,746
I'd like to get married on
a weekday while everybody's at work.

1701
01:44:39,847 --> 01:44:43,417
And if I ride off into the sunset,
I want my own horse.

1702
01:44:43,517 --> 01:44:45,953
- Should I be writing this down?
- And there's something else.

1703
01:44:46,053 --> 01:44:48,555
No, you can tell me.
Don't--

1704
01:44:48,622 --> 01:44:50,557
Okay.

1705

- Used--
- Well, they're mine.

1707
01:45:05,973 --> 01:45:10,944
I'm turning in
my running shoes to you.

1708

This is serious.

1709
01:45:16,216 --> 01:45:17,885
And there's one more thing.

1710
01:45:17,951 --> 01:45:20,821
I know, the mind reels that
there could be more after this.

-But, um, if you could just have a seat.

Okay. Okay.

- Oh, no. My, God, no.
- No, no. Don't hide your face.

1715
01:45:43,277 --> 01:45:46,280
This happens once in a lifetime,
and it's definitely a first for me.

1716

You're not gonna want to miss it,
so pay close attention.

1718

1721
01:46:16,276 --> 01:46:19,479
I gotta think about this
a little bit.

1722
01:46:19,546 --> 01:46:23,650
- Good. I was hoping you would say that.
- You were not! Not true.

1723
01:46:23,717 --> 01:46:26,653
If you'd said yes, I wouldn't
be able to do this next part...

1724
01:46:26,720 --> 01:46:28,555

1732

that if I don't ask you to be mine,

1733
01:47:02,656 --> 01:47:05,225
I'll regret it
for the rest of my life.

1
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:37,440
"Girl, I love..." No.

2
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:39,300
"Girl, I love your..."

3
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:41,060
No, that ain't it.

4
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:43,260
"Girl, I love your style.

5
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:45,770
"I love when you get that smile.

6
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:48,960
"You should be in a magazine,
because you're a queen.

7
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:51,620
"Our love is everything."

8
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:55,750
- Percy?
- Not right now. I'm busy.

9
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:58,090
You got a girl in there?

10
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:03,900
What kind of question is that,
"You got a woman in here?"

11
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:05,600
I didn't know. I heard you talking.

12
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:07,650
- I'm in here doing my vows.
- Vows?

13
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:11,300
For this ridiculous party
my wife is losing her mind over!

14
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:15,870
This extravaganza is costing a lot of money.
Now she wants us to renew our vows.

15
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:18,180
What was wrong with what I said
the first time?

16
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:20,770
- What's wrong with "I do"? I did, didn't I?
- Yes, you did.

17
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:24,320
- Women, boy.
- I know. Women, it's just a whole other...

18
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:31,940
You know what? I think it's cool
you're just doing the lyrics from that song.

19
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:33,890
I wrote this on the way to work
this morning.

20
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,720
- You wrote that on the way to work?
- Yeah.

21
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:39,360
Were you listening to the radio
when you wrote it? 'Cause I think it's B2K.

22
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:42,810
Okay, then. If this is to a song,
tell me what the next line is.

23
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:45,820
Baby, turn around

24
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:49,470
And let me see that sexy body
go bump, bump, bump

25
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:51,200
That's it.

26
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:54,460
Go.

27
00:01:57,510 --> 00:01:58,620
Reggie.

28
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:02,050
See your sexy smile and bump, bump?

29
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:04,160
- Three bumps.
- Three bumps.

30
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:09,470
See your sexy smile and you bump, bump

31
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:12,570
See your sexy smile and you

32
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:23,260
Hey, boss. Did I hear Theresa's bringing
a new boyfriend to your anniversary party?

33
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:24,350
Yes.

34
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,230
What? I'm fine with it.

35
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:30,620
- So, you met him?
- Nope. I pulled his credit report.

36
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:33,530
- You didn't.
- I sure as hell did.

37
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,830
Fred, this young brother is a stockbroker
for J.P. Oliver.

38
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:41,250
- Theresa? I don't believe it.
- Marilyn said she's crazy about him.

39
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:45,720
And this boy's credit report, I'm telling you,
is a thing of beauty.

40
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:47,220
I almost cried.

41
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:49,950
Wow, this guy sounds too good to be true.

42
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:53,180
He probably is. But the brother has a job.

43
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:56,280
- I'm glad you think that way...
- That's right, my friend. A J-O-B!

44
00:02:56,350 --> 00:02:57,780
...but I quit.

45
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:02,170
- I quit!
- Simon, calm down.

46
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:05,690
I'm just trying to explain to you
how the world works.

47
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,700
It's the clients, I'm just explaining...

48
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:10,940
None of my clients seem to care.
This guy didn't seem to care, did he?

49
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:12,730
Come on. Don't be so sensitive.

50
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,900
That's not how the world works.
It's how your world works.

51
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:18,840
Simon, sit down. Simon!

52
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:30,580
Jerk.

53
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:33,400
I don't need you, Nathan!

54
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:35,230
I don't need J.P. Oliver.

55
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:39,640
My rÃ©sumÃ© is good enough. I can get a job
anywhere I want. I'm out of here.

56
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:50,480
I'm not going to freak out!

57
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:53,330
What am I going to tell Theresa?

58
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,870
What am I going to tell her?

59
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:59,610
"Baby, you know how you're always
saying I'm at the office too much?

60
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,790
"Well, great news!"

61
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:04,540
I'll meet my future father-in-law and
tell him I'm unemployed. That'll be great.

62
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:07,320
Okay. I'll get the next one.

63
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:09,080
I can't quit my job!

64
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,760
I'm not gonna beg for this job!

65
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:15,550
- I got $20 says he goes up again.
- I'll take some of that.

66
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:17,850
Oh, my God! I just quit my job!

67
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:20,340
I don't need this job! No.

68
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:32,560
Here he comes.

69
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:39,000
- Hi.
- Have a good one.

70
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:42,900
Hello, Liz. Simon Green here.

71
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:45,050
Simon! What's up?

72
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:47,570
Every investment I've made
in the last six months.

73
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:52,240
Listen. That job you offered me.
Tell me it's still open.

74
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:53,520
Why? What happened?

75
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:56,310
I'll tell you about it later.
Can you talk to Bartlett for me?

76
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:58,610
Are you kidding?
I'm e-mailing him right now.

77
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,400
When he finds out you asked about this...

78
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:02,990
he will go nuts!

79
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:04,720
Liz, thank you.

80
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:49,970
Theresa? Baby?

81
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,030
You're home early.

82
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:56,240
Really early. Hi.

83
00:05:56,310 --> 00:05:59,370
- Got out of there quick.
- Good. Then come on, help me with these.

84
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:01,520
What have we got?

85
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,010
Tumi.

86
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:08,300
- That's nice. When did we get this?
- Got them today.

87
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:13,000
Combined incomes. Bling bling, baby!

88
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:14,770
Yeah. Bling bling.

89
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:20,360
Baby?

90
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:23,120
God. You should have heard Dad's voice
on the phone...

91
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:25,520
when I told him you work for J.P. Oliver.

92
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:28,620
I feel like he's more in love with you
than I am.

93
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:31,440
- Really?
- Yeah. You don't understand.

94
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:34,790
Ever since I can remember,
his whole thing has been about:

95
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:37,040
"Theresa, does that boy have a job?"

96
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:42,100
- It's a good thing I do then, huh?
- I know.

97
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:46,730
I'm so excited! Aren't you excited?

98
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:52,110
Theresa, a man is never excited
about meeting his future father-in-law.

99
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:57,700
You know, I was thinking.
Maybe we should postpone telling them.

100
00:06:58,580 --> 00:06:59,590
What?

101
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:01,700
- It was your idea.
- I know.

102
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:04,970
But I'm thinking now
that maybe it was a bad idea.

103
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,830
No, I think it's a great idea.

104
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:09,260
Announcing our engagement
at my parents' party...

105
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:12,200
is gonna be the best present
we can give them.

106
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:14,100
Babe, Mom's gonna flip.

107
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:18,090
See, I'm not worried about your mom.
I was thinking about...

108
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:20,750
him.

109
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:26,250
See, he's about ready
to pop a blood vessel...

110
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:29,610
in his head, because you guys
are losing a basketball game.

111
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,970
No, we were winning that game. Yeah.

112
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:41,190
We're bringing in a canopy here.

113
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:44,200
Swags of tulle with festoons.

114
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:45,990
Sprays of roses.

115
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:48,550
Parquet dance floor here.

116
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:51,210
Guests will be seated at tables
in Chiavari chairs.

117
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,220
Very clean, very simple, very elegant.

118
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:56,360
And rose petals on the lawn.
And not just a few...

119
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:57,760
oodles.

120
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:01,220
At my wedding, we had oodles of petals.
It was fabulous.

121
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:03,910
At that wedding, was a woman involved?

122
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,050
Of course it involved a woman.

123
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:09,570
If she's not a woman, it's gonna be
a surprise to both of us. Hello!

124
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:12,940
- Look.
- I'll tell you, this is going to be some party.

125
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:15,270
Twenty-five years of marriage.

126
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:18,500
- More power to you, pal.
- Thank you.

127
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:20,900
- Hey, baby.
- Sorry I'm late.

128
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:23,400
My vice principal called in sick today...

129
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:26,400
so it was just me
against 208 middle-schoolers.

130
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:29,610
I swear half of them
ate pure sugar for breakfast.

131
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,690
Hi, Dante.

132
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:35,050
- So, Percy, which one do you like best?
- I like that...

133
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:36,770
Is your name Percy?

134
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:38,430
Which one costs the most?

135
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:40,480
- They cost the same.
- They don't cost the same.

136
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:42,560
This one's from Saks.
This one's from Macy's.

137
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:43,680
Saks!

138
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:47,490
Thank you.
And now I can give my honest opinion.

139
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:51,970
- I'm digging that one, baby.
- Really?

140
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:56,230
Well, that's too bad,
'cause I'm wearing this one.

141
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:57,610
Hallelujah.

142
00:08:59,530 --> 00:09:00,810
Sweetheart.

143
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:02,400
- Yeah?
- Listen.

144
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:04,970
Why do you even bother asking me?

145
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:07,850
'Cause it's a big day for us
and I wanted you to feel included.

146
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:10,530
Why couldn't you include
Martha Superfreak out there?

147
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,190
Dante is a nice man.

148
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:13,990
A nice man.

149
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:17,120
A nice man that part of the time
likes to sleep with other nice men.

150
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:18,340
Will you stop it?

151
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:21,570
Would you open your mind, Percy Jones?
Dante is a metrosexual.

152
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:23,610
- A what?
- He's a straight man with taste.

153
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:26,980
No such thing. You might as well tell me
he rode over here on a unicorn.

154
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:30,240
Look, serious face, serious moment.

155
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:31,810
I need to talk to you.

156
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:34,730
I know, baby. I'm working on my vows.
Almost got them perfect.

157
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:37,610
- That's sweet, but that's not it.
- What is it?

158
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:41,060
This boy that Theresa's bringing home?

159
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:44,060
I don't know who his people are,
where he's from...

160
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:46,370
I don't know anything about him.

161
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:49,370
But what I do know is that
I need you to be nice.

162
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:51,170
I'm always nice.

163
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:54,020
Let's be nice long enough
to find out who the boy is.

164
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:56,000
I already know who he is.

165
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:58,560
- You pulled his credit report?
- I did not.

166
00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:01,050
You pulled his credit report, Percy?

167
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:04,640
I mean, I glanced at it.

168
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:07,520
But a credit report don't tell you
the character of a man.

169
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:09,980
But being a loan officer for 22 years...

170
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:12,070
I can size that boy up in an instant.

171
00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:14,690
And you know I got a knack for it.
You know that.

172
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,860
Five seconds. That's all I need.

173
00:10:18,530 --> 00:10:20,060
That's all I need.

174
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,260
- Nobody knows that better than me.
- Say what?

175
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:26,080
I didn't stutter.

176
00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:36,930
I'm not so good with dads, baby.

177
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:39,840
I'm good with moms. I'm better with moms.

178
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:41,980
He's a big guy, right?

179
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:44,250
Scary big. He also has these...

180
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,690
piercing eyes that just burn
right into your soul.

181
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:51,130
Don't maintain eye contact for
a long period of time. At least today, okay?

182
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,900
Babe, I'm kidding.
Just relax. It's gonna be fun.

183
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:57,820
Okay?

184
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:02,270
- Did you tell them?
- What? Tell them what?

185
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,570
- Babe, don't... The...
- What?

186
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:08,090
- Did you... I'm...
- Cute? Clean-shaven? What?

187
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,610
Pigment-challenged?
Did you tell them that I'm white?

188
00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:12,100
You're white?

189
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:13,720
You're white?

190
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,220
Stop the car!

191
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:18,970
Oh, my God! Look at what you...

192
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:23,420
Oh, my God.

193
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:25,110
Simon, I'm so sorry.

194
00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:29,080
- It was a joke, sir. I was kidding.
- Yeah, sister. You're funny.

195
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:31,550
Simon, are you okay?

196
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,620
- Who are you?
- Are you serious?

197
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,670
Why am I in Jersey?

198
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:44,790
- Don't worry. It's gonna be great, okay?
- All right.

199
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:47,510
I'm very sorry. It was a bad joke.

200
00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:52,160
- So, did you tell them?
- No. I only told them the important things.

201
00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:56,320
That I love you.
That you're an amazing man.

202
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:59,800
That you have a very cute birthmark
on your left butt cheek.

203
00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:04,440
You just didn't feel the need to mention
it's a Caucasian butt cheek. That was...

204
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:09,530
Simon, look. I didn't mention it
because I don't think it's gonna matter.

205
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,180
It's gonna matter.

206
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:14,520
We're fine, sir.

207
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,060
Dad!

208
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:42,730
Look at this here. Oh, my God.
Give your daddy a hug.

209
00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:46,160
How are you?

210
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,380
Mom!

211
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:52,540
- Hey, my man. Percy Jones, baby.
- Pleasure to meet you.

212
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:57,010
Man, look at this here. I like this, man.
Nice, solid, strong grip.

213
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:59,470
Wow. That's something else.

214
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:02,960
Listen. You doing everything you can
to make my daughter happy?

215
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:05,300
- No, Dad, it's...
- Hey, sweetheart.

216
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:07,220
You can take that to the front door for me.

217
00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:08,720
- Thank you.
- No, you see, this...

218
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:11,790
Don't interrupt.
I'm giving your friend a once-over here.

219
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:15,690
Sir? Don't stand like a statue.
Take it to the front door.

220
00:13:15,770 --> 00:13:18,700
That's that square with the hole.
Look inside, you see furniture.

221
00:13:18,770 --> 00:13:20,050
- Thank you.
- Yes, sir.

222
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:22,490
You doing everything in your power
to make her happy?

223
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:25,750
I'm not sure if I am,
but I'd sure like a crack at it.

224
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:29,080
- Boy, I ought to drill you, man. I like him.
- Okay, all right, listen.

225
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:32,050
Young man, don't worry about it. Relax.

226
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:35,120
I figure, what, $30?
Get yourself some candy or something.

227
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:36,820
Dad, this is Simon.

228
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,080
Simon?

229
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:44,210
- That's her boyfriend's name.
- That's right.

230
00:13:45,010 --> 00:13:47,470
- Well, who are you?
- Wesley Thompson. That's my cab.

231
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:50,840
But if you're still down with me
making your girl happy...

232
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:52,330
I'm good to go.

233
00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:55,190
- Why don't you just go?
- Just...

234
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:07,220
I wish Theresa would have told me
you guys were black.

235
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:09,900
That would have saved an awkward moment.

236
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:13,590
- Kind of like this one.
- Yeah.

237
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,580
- Welcome home, sweetheart.
- Thanks, Mom.

238
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:20,400
- Baby, let me get that.
- I got it.

239
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,410
Lemonade.

240
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:25,800
Damn!

241
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:35,570
Ain't no need, us standing out here.
Why don't we go on inside and talk?

242
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:39,460
Come on, we going on inside
with a quickness. No use standing out here.

243
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:40,970
Just come on.

244
00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:42,340
That boy's white.

245
00:14:42,770 --> 00:14:44,110
Nothing gets past you.

246
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:47,500
I guess it's those 22 years as a loan officer.

247
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:50,320
- You knew about this.
- I didn't know a thing, I promise you.

248
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:53,420
But I did figure it out
after the second "Daddy!"

249
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:56,720
Why she just didn't say nothing?
Give us a warning, you know?

250
00:14:56,780 --> 00:14:59,780
We taught our girls
to see only people, not color.

251
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:02,570
- I know that but...
- So, what's the problem?

252
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:05,860
I guess the problem is
she just didn't tell us.

253
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:08,940
I'm expecting Denzel Washington
to come walking through the door...

254
00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:10,760
and I get Whitey McWhiteman instead.

255
00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:13,100
- Hi, you guys.
- Hi!

256
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:15,620
I'm just showing Simon the house.

257
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:17,480
You've a very beautiful home, Mrs. Jones.

258
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:20,680
- Why, thank you. You can call me Marilyn.
- Will do.

259
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:22,480
You, too, Mr. Jones.

260
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:25,030
Thank you. You can call me Mr. Jones.

261
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:29,190
I'm just kidding.

262
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:32,550
You got me. That was funny.

263
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,020
I'm making lemonade.
You want to sit down?

264
00:15:35,090 --> 00:15:38,150
- Yes, thank you. Sit down, babe.
- Great.

265
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:41,190
So, Simon, they tell me
you work at J.P. Oliver?

266
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:42,410
Yes, sir.

267
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:46,440
- You like it there? You been there long?
- Well, it's a couple of years, I suppose.

268
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:50,630
- You moving up?
- There's been some recent movement, yes.

269
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:53,250
- You a hard worker? You work hard?
- The hardest.

270
00:15:53,330 --> 00:15:56,770
- J.P. Oliver has a huge IPO coming up...
- He doesn't want to hear about this.

271
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,980
But he's asking you about your work.

272
00:15:59,050 --> 00:16:02,470
- I know, but you go into details...
- He likes to be modest. Shut up.

273
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:06,500
Anyway, they made Simon their IPO...
Wait, what is it? Point man?

274
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:08,990
And they're flying him
to San Francisco on Monday.

275
00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:11,300
I'm not going to see him for three days.

276
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:13,760
- So, Simon, what do your parents do?
- Yeah.

277
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:16,290
- My mother is a realtor.
- Mom, let me help you with that.

278
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:19,180
And she sells mini-blinds
and teaches dance.

279
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:21,900
Damn. How many jobs your mama got?

280
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:25,420
She's a single parent.
She's always been a hard worker.

281
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,300
What happened to your father?

282
00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:31,740
He left when I was two
and I haven't seen much of him since.

283
00:16:32,170 --> 00:16:35,430
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- It happens.

284
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:38,050
You play any sports?

285
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:43,520
I played some foosball in college.

286
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:48,830
- That's the table with the soccer guys...
- I know what foosball is.

287
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:50,850
- Stupid joke.
- It's not a sport.

288
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,640
Dad, stop badgering him.

289
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:55,680
I'm not badgering him.
I'm just taking an interest.

290
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:58,620
I don't understand why you don't
play sports? It don't make sense.

291
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:01,830
A man who don't play sports
isn't a real man, as far as I'm concerned.

292
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:04,230
- I used to run a little.
- What? Like track?

293
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:10,790
I mean, you don't look like a sprinter.

294
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:13,090
- What'd you run? Did you steeplechase?
- Dad!

295
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,920
Come on, man. What was your race?

296
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:16,870
- Cars.
- Cars.

297
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:19,970
- NASCAR.
- NASCAR!

298
00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:22,210
That was the one.

299
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:25,730
I had some hopes and some dreams and...

300
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:29,700
it all ended on a hot August day
on a speedway in Charlotte.

301
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:32,200
It was a crash. Just...

302
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:37,990
They said I should've been killed.

303
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:41,500
Actually, I got out without a scratch.
I figured that was a sign.

304
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:42,970
NASCAR?

305
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:45,220
Mostly I just worked in the pit.

306
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:48,190
I mean, I test drove
for one of the drivers some, but...

307
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:49,850
What was his name?

308
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,600
Jay Gordon.

309
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:55,640
You drove for Jeff Gordon?

310
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,390
We called him Jay or J.G.
It was like a pet name.

311
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:02,560
A pit name, actually.

312
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:04,280
NASCAR?

313
00:18:05,290 --> 00:18:08,320
I believe I said I don't like to talk
about that time in my life.

314
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:09,500
NASCAR?

315
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:11,960
What was I supposed to do?

316
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:14,850
He was staring at me
with those piercing eyes.

317
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,440
- He was not.
- It was like...

318
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:20,830
filled with piercing disappointment
'cause I don't play sports?

319
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:24,130
"A man who don't play sports
isn't really a man now, is he?"

320
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:27,190
I had to give him something! He's big.

321
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:30,360
He's like... You said he was big,
but he's big-big.

322
00:18:30,430 --> 00:18:33,400
But why did you lie about NASCAR?
My father loves NASCAR.

323
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:36,860
It's NASCAR, baby. That's, like,
the whitest sport on the planet.

324
00:18:36,930 --> 00:18:38,270
Not anymore, Simon.

325
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:40,760
There's, like, NASCAR and hockey.

326
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,220
Hockey. I should have went with hockey.

327
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:47,320
Don't worry. He'll forget about it.
He's like this with everyone.

328
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:50,490
It always takes him some time
to warm up to new people. That's all.

329
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:54,650
- What are we talking about here?
- By Sunday, you'll be a part of this family.

330
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:57,410
I can tell he really likes you.

331
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,280
I don't like him.

332
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:05,310
And I really don't think
the whole racial thing matters to him.

333
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:08,410
- It's not that he's white.
- It's not?

334
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:23,030
- Is this yours or mine?
- That's mine and that's for later.

335
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:25,470
No. I think it's for now.

336
00:19:26,430 --> 00:19:29,660
- Lf memory serves me right, I think it's mine.
- No, Simon.

337
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:33,400
Take it off!

338
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:36,190
- Take it off right now.
- It's perfect on me.

339
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:38,680
- What are you doing?
- Look at it. Red is my color.

340
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:42,070
- Always has been. Look at it. My goodness!
- Simon, take it off.

341
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:43,250
But it fits me so perfectly.

342
00:19:43,330 --> 00:19:44,470
Look, you're stretching it!

343
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:46,200
- Take it off right now.
- It's not ruined.

344
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:47,960
It's nice. You take it off.

345
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:49,940
- I'm not joking.
- You want some of this?

346
00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:51,480
Stop it, Simon.

347
00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:53,560
- Take it off.
- You take it off.

348
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:54,910
Coming in.

349
00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:00,240
Mom!

350
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:03,920
- I'm going to tell her right now.
- Go and tell.

351
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,750
- What?
- He's taking Simon to a hotel!

352
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:08,950
I'm paying for it. What's the problem?

353
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:10,390
- Can I speak to you?
- You sure can.

354
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:11,870
Why are you taking him to a hotel?

355
00:20:11,930 --> 00:20:14,100
You didn't see
what they were about to do upstairs.

356
00:20:14,170 --> 00:20:17,040
- Mom, we were just playing.
- Well, playtime is over.

357
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,800
Mr. Jones, I'm not a cross-dresser.

358
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:21,810
Just for the record.

359
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,860
- A cross-dresser?
- No.

360
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:25,880
What are you... It's lingerie.

361
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:29,110
- You shouldn't even be having any.
- I'm a grown woman, Percy!

362
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:31,350
- It is not covering up the grown parts!
- What!

363
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:33,330
Why does the young man
have to go to a hotel?

364
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,640
Don't start with me.
This is my house and my rules.

365
00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:36,660
Your rules?

366
00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:38,590
This house can't handle
no more testosterone.

367
00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:40,560
We cannot exceed the testosterone level.

368
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:44,280
We gotta keep it like that until the girls
get married. Maybe even beyond that.

369
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:46,350
And I'm not suggesting anyone get married!

370
00:20:46,430 --> 00:20:48,470
Why can't he stay in the basement,
in your room?

371
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:51,090
Because that's my room!
That's my stuff down there.

372
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,850
- How selfish.
- That doesn't make sense.

373
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,200
It got mold, anyway.

374
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:57,360
Could be black mold. I wouldn't
feel comfortable putting him at risk.

375
00:20:57,430 --> 00:20:59,370
Do you have any idea
how ridiculous that sounds?

376
00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:00,460
No, it's okay.

377
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:02,900
No, it's not okay!
What are you talking about?

378
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:06,290
Look, this is your father's house.
We're gonna play it by his rules.

379
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:09,430
Now, he's obviously set
a testosterone standard.

380
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:10,870
And I'm going to abide by that.

381
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:14,420
- You falling for that? I'm going with you.
- No, you're not gonna do that.

382
00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:17,590
- You don't want me to go with you?
- Of course I want you to!

383
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:18,770
But what?

384
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:20,330
- You need to stay here.
- Hello?

385
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:24,240
You need to stay here.

386
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:26,800
- No. I want to be with you!
- We're still here!

387
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:29,810
Are you two gonna be done soon,
or maybe we should have a seat?

388
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,160
Come on, honey. Let's sit...

389
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:34,540
You need to help your mom
with the party arrangements.

390
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:37,210
We don't want to stress them out, do we?

391
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:38,570
No.

392
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:40,590
- All right?
- Yes.

393
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:45,680
- All right. We're all set.
- I'm glad you all decided. Come on, let's go.

394
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:48,560
- Come on, get your stuff. Let's go.
- Yeah. All right.

395
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:52,210
Where is he? Girl!

396
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:53,710
Oh, my God. Are we being audited?

397
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:55,340
- No, Keisha.
- What's happening?

398
00:21:55,410 --> 00:21:59,060
This is Simon. This is Theresa's boyfriend.
This is Keisha, her little sister.

399
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,140
Go.

400
00:22:00,210 --> 00:22:03,730
- Nice to meet you.
- Oh, this... Yes. Nice to meet you, too.

401
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:06,610
Good, you all met. Take it to the car.
I'll meet you out there.

402
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:10,220
- Dad, Theresa's boyfriend is white.
- I know.

403
00:22:10,290 --> 00:22:11,630
I know you know.

404
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:14,320
I just wanted to see your face
when you heard it again.

405
00:22:14,390 --> 00:22:15,570
Not now.

406
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:19,600
- Don't forget we have dinner reservations.
- We'll meet you over there.

407
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:47,920
She was black as the night

408
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:52,330
Louie was whiter than white

409
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:54,570
Danger

410
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:57,200
Take a walk on the wild side

411
00:22:57,260 --> 00:22:59,850
And the colored girls go
doo do doo do doo

412
00:23:13,170 --> 00:23:14,690
Looks like rain.

413
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:17,220
Nope.

414
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:23,280
- Those clouds look pretty threatening.
- I live here. I know the weather.

415
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:31,120
So, Theresa tells me you're in charge
of the loan department at the bank.

416
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,250
That must be a rewarding job.

417
00:23:39,690 --> 00:23:42,410
I'm thinking about making a switch
to a smaller company.

418
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,680
I just think there's less political garbage.

419
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:47,020
You think I don't deal
with political garbage?

420
00:23:47,090 --> 00:23:49,570
I got political garbage coming out my ass.

421
00:23:49,650 --> 00:23:52,260
If I give a guy a loan,
I'm married to him for 30 years.

422
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:55,270
If I deny him, I have to deal with him
in church on Sunday.

423
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:59,140
- I know that feeling.
- Don't try to act like our jobs are alike.

424
00:24:02,570 --> 00:24:04,480
Good thing it isn't raining.

425
00:24:05,550 --> 00:24:07,850
That's not rain. It's sprinkling.

426
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:11,050
You might want to turn on
the windshield wipers.

427
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:13,290
I will once it starts raining.

428
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,200
Come on, you two, let's go.

429
00:24:19,690 --> 00:24:22,030
- I don't want to be late. Keisha!
- Coming!

430
00:24:22,090 --> 00:24:23,950
Why you always got to knock
on my door first?

431
00:24:24,010 --> 00:24:25,290
'Cause you still live here.

432
00:24:25,350 --> 00:24:27,460
Let's go. It's raining. I don't wanna be late.

433
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:30,760
Come on.

434
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:37,990
Okay, tell me what's it like?

435
00:24:38,890 --> 00:24:41,920
- What's what like?
- Being with a white guy.

436
00:24:42,950 --> 00:24:45,920
- Come on, Keisha, what's the sex like?
- Yeah.

437
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:48,680
Where's Mom?

438
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:52,160
She's downstairs, girl. Come on! Bring it.

439
00:24:52,230 --> 00:24:56,610
Okay. You know that thing they say
about the size? Completely the opposite.

440
00:24:57,220 --> 00:24:59,010
- Really?
- They're huge.

441
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:03,130
And not only are their penises big,
but they can sing.

442
00:25:03,850 --> 00:25:05,700
When they get excited, they sing up a storm.

443
00:25:05,770 --> 00:25:07,870
They know a million tunes.
They're like big iPods.

444
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:10,250
Cut it out. Stop it.

445
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:14,530
Keisha, seriously, is he nice?

446
00:25:14,790 --> 00:25:17,130
- Yeah, and he's cute, too.
- I know.

447
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,840
- What about Mom and Dad?
- Mom is cool with it.

448
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:24,830
I mean, Dad, he seems, you know,
a little on edge, but not more than usual.

449
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:25,850
Isn't he ever?

450
00:25:25,930 --> 00:25:27,650
- Girls!
- Coming!

451
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:32,290
But can I just say,
I love you so much right now because...

452
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:36,480
- Why?
...from now on, no matter what I do, if I...

453
00:25:37,130 --> 00:25:39,680
- crash Dad's car, or if I...
- What's wrong?

454
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:41,120
...rob a bank...

455
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:44,640
- if I burn this house down...
- Keisha.

456
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:48,450
...I won't be the one
who brought home the white boy!

457
00:25:52,610 --> 00:25:53,890
Thank you!

458
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:57,980
Mom!

459
00:26:00,610 --> 00:26:03,390
- Can I help you with your bag, sir?
- I'm okay. I got it.

460
00:26:05,510 --> 00:26:07,900
You don't trust a working man
with your bag?

461
00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:10,690
No, I just... It's just one bag.

462
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:13,060
What do you think,
he'll rifle through your luggage...

463
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,610
and steal your toothbrush
and your fancy conditioner?

464
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:19,330
- No, that's not it at all.
- Let me tell you something.

465
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:24,060
Theresa's grandfather was a bellman for
over 60 years and he never stole nothing.

466
00:26:27,430 --> 00:26:29,020
Could you get my bag?

467
00:26:29,090 --> 00:26:31,030
What, he's your slave now?

468
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:32,700
No.

469
00:26:32,770 --> 00:26:35,010
Did you want me to take your bag, sir?

470
00:26:36,930 --> 00:26:38,340
I don't know.

471
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:39,970
- Next, please.
- Okay.

472
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:43,770
Hi. Reservation for Percy Jones.

473
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,380
And that's Jones with a "J"?

474
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:49,120
No, Jones with a "P."

475
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:51,190
I made the reservation last week.

476
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,640
You knew you were gonna kick me out
a week ago?

477
00:26:55,710 --> 00:26:58,500
Son, I knew I was gonna kick you out
24 years ago...

478
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:00,540
when the doctor announced it was a girl.

479
00:27:00,610 --> 00:27:02,270
- Here you are.
- Good.

480
00:27:02,530 --> 00:27:04,830
- We gave your room away.
- What?

481
00:27:05,510 --> 00:27:07,000
Check-in was at 4:00.

482
00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:10,070
It's Thursday night. I'm quite sure
you got another room available.

483
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:12,890
I'm sorry, we're completely booked
and so is everyone else.

484
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:15,890
There's a Shriners convention
in town, actually.

485
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:19,770
May I help you with anything else,
Mr. Pjones?

486
00:27:21,470 --> 00:27:23,480
I guess I'll have to stay at your house, then.

487
00:27:23,550 --> 00:27:27,130
No, there's a crack hotel downtown.
You'll be just fine. Come on.

488
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:30,230
Next.

489
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:34,070
Hi. Welcome to Cranford.

490
00:27:35,010 --> 00:27:39,000
- I don't know what your basement's like...
- It's damp. You'd hate it.

491
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:42,640
I don't think dampness is really an issue
at this point.

492
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:46,360
You can't think about anything but getting
back in the house with my daughter.

493
00:27:46,430 --> 00:27:49,880
Mr. Jones, I'm in your house.
I'll obey your rules.

494
00:27:50,530 --> 00:27:52,440
Yeah, right. You'll obey Mr. Jones now...

495
00:27:52,510 --> 00:27:54,450
but when you're up at 3:00 in the morning...

496
00:27:54,530 --> 00:27:56,350
all hot and horny, you'll obey Mr. Johnson.

497
00:27:56,410 --> 00:28:00,090
You heard the lady. There's no available
hotel rooms in the whole town.

498
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:03,990
- I'm not gonna do anything. I swear.
- Put your stuff in there. Come on.

499
00:28:08,410 --> 00:28:10,230
You know, dinner's in about 10 minutes.

500
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:14,130
I don't know what Marilyn is like
about schedule, but I know Theresa is...

501
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:16,190
Stay out of that storm.

502
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:20,600
All right. You can stay in my basement.

503
00:28:20,890 --> 00:28:25,200
But you remember one thing.
These eyes, they see everything.

504
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:27,800
Now get in the car. Come on, let's go.

505
00:28:32,630 --> 00:28:35,250
Ebony, ivory

506
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:37,690
living in perfect harmony

507
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:41,620
Ivory, ebony

508
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,590
So, how long have you two been together?

509
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:47,350
- Five months.
- Six months.

510
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:48,940
Which one is it?

511
00:28:49,910 --> 00:28:53,300
Well, see, Theresa counts
from the first day that we met.

512
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:55,640
And I count from the first...

513
00:28:59,610 --> 00:29:02,130
- How's the chicken here?
- It's really good.

514
00:29:02,330 --> 00:29:03,760
Did I tell you two girls...

515
00:29:03,830 --> 00:29:07,000
that for the first dance,
your father and I are gonna do the tango?

516
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:08,660
- The tango?
- You and Dad?

517
00:29:08,730 --> 00:29:12,500
You know what? Your father and I used to
dance all the time when we were younger.

518
00:29:12,570 --> 00:29:14,710
Sweetheart, I told you
we're not doing a tango.

519
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:17,260
We're already saying our vows.
That's enough.

520
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:19,090
We're doing the tango.

521
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:21,360
Sorry. I forgot to turn it off.

522
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:25,450
Know what? This is an important call.
I'm just gonna...

523
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:29,170
No, you can take your call here.
Sit down and take your call.

524
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:32,660
It's a business call. It's boring stuff.

525
00:29:32,730 --> 00:29:35,860
Business is not boring.
Simon, sit down and take your call.

526
00:29:35,930 --> 00:29:36,870
Sit down.

527
00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:41,240
- Hello.
- Simon?

528
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:44,680
- Yeah, this is Simon.
- Sorry I didn't get back to you earlier.

529
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:46,990
I hope Theresa makes good money
as a photographer.

530
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:49,810
Someone started a rumor
that you're being investigated...

531
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:51,700
by the Securities
and Exchange Commission.

532
00:29:54,290 --> 00:29:57,080
That is so Nathan to do something like that.

533
00:29:57,650 --> 00:29:59,110
I think it's Nathan, too...

534
00:29:59,190 --> 00:30:03,530
'cause this is the last thing he wants to see,
is his best employee going to another firm.

535
00:30:03,610 --> 00:30:04,950
You know me.

536
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:09,770
- I'm always up for a new challenge.
- Are you listening to me?

537
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:12,270
- You've been blackballed.
- Great!

538
00:30:12,850 --> 00:30:16,110
Guy, it's not my fault.
I'm just telling you what they told me.

539
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:17,640
I'll call you next week.

540
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:20,330
Did Nathan put you up for another award?

541
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,930
Nothing. It's embarrassing.

542
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,540
- Hello. Can I start you off with some drinks?
- Vodka tonic.

543
00:30:30,130 --> 00:30:32,340
Celebrating a great phone call.

544
00:30:33,390 --> 00:30:36,970
Okay. Bring him his liquor,
and bring the rest of us our usual.

545
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:39,150
They have iced tea and I have my lemonade.

546
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:42,670
Actually, I think I'm gonna have
a glass of Pinot Grigio.

547
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:46,610
- And I'll have a Cosmo.
- Me, too.

548
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:52,040
Okay. Bring them their alcohol
and I'll have my usual lemonade.

549
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:55,210
Someone has to act responsibly
around here.

550
00:30:55,410 --> 00:30:58,060
So, Simon, I hear that you're a singer.

551
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:02,190
What are you, a soprano, an alto, or...

552
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:04,460
No? Maybe bass?

553
00:31:07,410 --> 00:31:08,720
I don't really sing.

554
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:10,790
How long can you hold a note?

555
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:12,170
He can hold a note.

556
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,380
- Really?
- For a very long time.

557
00:31:14,450 --> 00:31:16,240
Sing something for me, baby.

558
00:31:17,810 --> 00:31:20,650
Are you okay? Drink some water.

559
00:31:21,010 --> 00:31:24,900
Jerry, Nathan's got my ankles
to my earlobes right now. I'm gonna need...

560
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:27,330
I'm gonna need some cash.

561
00:31:28,690 --> 00:31:32,000
Call me back as soon as you get this.
I need a favor, okay?

562
00:31:45,930 --> 00:31:47,840
You've got to be kidding me.

563
00:32:08,270 --> 00:32:10,600
"Let me see your sexy body go..."

564
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:17,060
I knew you'd be down here sooner or later.

565
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:20,260
Did you bring some of that
sexy lingerie for me to try?

566
00:32:20,330 --> 00:32:23,910
What is wrong with you, boy?
Don't you have your own underwear?

567
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:27,910
You like my space?

568
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:31,140
Yeah. It's very homey. Interesting odor.

569
00:32:31,630 --> 00:32:33,220
I told you it had mold.

570
00:32:33,290 --> 00:32:37,250
Did you come down here for this?
Having a little trouble writing your vows?

571
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:39,660
That's none of your damn business.

572
00:32:40,430 --> 00:32:44,680
I'm just saying, I could maybe help you
come up with something romantic.

573
00:32:45,290 --> 00:32:48,220
Don't start thinking that you know more
about romance than I do.

574
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:50,600
With your hand-holding
and feeding each other food...

575
00:32:50,670 --> 00:32:52,360
and wiping off each other's faces.

576
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:53,950
That's bullshit.

577
00:32:54,310 --> 00:32:56,800
Being married 25 years, that's real romance.

578
00:32:56,870 --> 00:33:00,650
And believe me, it's a war.
Brutal. Exhausting.

579
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:06,120
Sounds like someone
just finished their vows.

580
00:33:07,910 --> 00:33:10,530
- Ready for lights out?
- Looks that way.

581
00:33:12,170 --> 00:33:13,860
- Good night.
- Good night.

582
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:17,820
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

583
00:33:24,970 --> 00:33:27,720
- What are you doing?
- Getting ready to go to sleep.

584
00:33:28,870 --> 00:33:31,870
- Here? You're sleeping here?
- Right here.

585
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:35,970
- Don't you have a bed upstairs?
- Sure do. So does Theresa.

586
00:33:37,030 --> 00:33:40,610
By me sleeping here assures me
that she'll get a good night's sleep...

587
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:42,950
all alone. Good night.

588
00:33:51,590 --> 00:33:52,700
Sorry.

589
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:59,040
- What are you doing under there?
- It's just a pillow.

590
00:33:59,850 --> 00:34:02,370
- We might need a barrier.
- A barrier for what?

591
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:04,540
I tend to move around a lot in my sleep.

592
00:34:04,610 --> 00:34:06,650
How do you know you move around
if you're asleep?

593
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,930
Theresa mentioned once that...

594
00:34:09,250 --> 00:34:11,360
I mentioned it to her...

595
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:13,570
after someone else told me...

596
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:15,870
that wasn't Theresa.

597
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:22,360
Okay. We can talk about this, right?
Theresa and I have a...

598
00:34:22,430 --> 00:34:24,860
- No, you can't talk about it.
...healthy relationship...

599
00:34:24,930 --> 00:34:26,660
- Stop!
- We can't talk about this?

600
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:29,510
I don't wanna hear you talking
about sleeping with my daughter.

601
00:34:29,570 --> 00:34:32,390
You're sleeping with me now.
Now, good night!

602
00:35:42,530 --> 00:35:44,280
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

603
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:45,810
You're up early.

604
00:35:45,890 --> 00:35:48,500
Or late, depending on how you look at it.

605
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:51,860
- Coffee?
- Yes. Bless you.

606
00:35:54,170 --> 00:35:56,280
I don't know how you sleep with that man.

607
00:35:56,350 --> 00:35:58,770
- Did he get in your space?
- A little bit.

608
00:35:59,330 --> 00:36:00,890
Did he spoon you?

609
00:36:01,210 --> 00:36:04,410
It was more of a wedge maneuver.

610
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:08,310
Big man likes to cuddle in his sleep.

611
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:12,340
I just wish he were a little bit more cuddly
when he was awake.

612
00:36:12,410 --> 00:36:16,570
You know, when my father first met
Percy Jones, he could not stand him.

613
00:36:16,670 --> 00:36:17,880
Really?

614
00:36:17,950 --> 00:36:20,120
But eventually they got along, right?

615
00:36:20,570 --> 00:36:21,550
No.

616
00:36:22,170 --> 00:36:25,270
- Good morning!
- Good morning.

617
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:27,990
Good morning, babe.

618
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:30,550
- I missed you.
- I missed you.

619
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:33,050
- Did you sleep well?
- Yeah.

620
00:36:37,850 --> 00:36:40,980
- Who's going with me to get some flowers?
- I'll go.

621
00:36:41,150 --> 00:36:44,500
Me, too, if we go early,
because I have to work this afternoon.

622
00:36:48,410 --> 00:36:49,460
Good morning!

623
00:36:49,530 --> 00:36:51,600
You're looking awfully chipper this morning.

624
00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:55,600
Something about knowing your daughter's
not being violated relaxes a man.

625
00:36:55,670 --> 00:36:57,780
I thought you said
that mattress hurts your back.

626
00:36:57,850 --> 00:37:01,300
No, not me.
I could sleep on that mattress every night.

627
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:03,830
Every single night.

628
00:37:27,770 --> 00:37:30,730
Good morning, boss. Got you some coffee.

629
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:34,390
- So, what's the verdict?
- What are you talking about?

630
00:37:34,450 --> 00:37:36,340
I'm talking about Theresa's new boyfriend.

631
00:37:36,410 --> 00:37:40,150
What is he, a painter? Poet?
Did he ask you to borrow some money?

632
00:37:40,210 --> 00:37:44,520
My daughter's got great taste in men.
That new guy, he's really something.

633
00:37:45,270 --> 00:37:48,750
- Tell me a little bit about the brother.
- Oh, man, thank you.

634
00:37:49,270 --> 00:37:52,820
I'll tell you about the brother.
He's a big guy. Nice looking.

635
00:37:52,890 --> 00:37:54,790
- What's his name?
- Jamal.

636
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:57,870
- Graduated Howard University.
- Howard?

637
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:00,050
Played basketball.

638
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:03,250
He almost went pro.
Till he changed his career to medicine.

639
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:05,680
There was a big write-up on him in Jet
four years ago.

640
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:07,030
No shit.

641
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:08,910
Parents from Atlanta.

642
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:12,240
Friends with Mrs. King,
Dr. Cosby, Rev. Jackson.

643
00:38:12,310 --> 00:38:13,650
Come on now.

644
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:17,610
- Go down towards the middle.
- Go down? Sit up a little bit.

645
00:38:18,450 --> 00:38:21,100
- That's it?
- Man, yeah.

646
00:38:23,090 --> 00:38:26,190
I'm telling you, Reggie.
I'm the luckiest man in Jersey.

647
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:29,200
My daughter's dating the great black hope.

648
00:38:29,270 --> 00:38:31,050
- You got it.
- That's it.

649
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:32,940
- Hold it right there.
- I'm not gonna move.

650
00:38:37,490 --> 00:38:38,980
Excuse me? Boss?

651
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:42,120
Simon Green here to see you.

652
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:46,160
Lifting, you know.

653
00:38:50,030 --> 00:38:53,070
Cut that off, Reggie. Go on, take it out.

654
00:38:53,710 --> 00:38:56,330
Come on, Reggie.
Get on the ball around the...

655
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,090
I'll be right there.

656
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:03,310
I'll be right out. Give me... Sign something.

657
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:11,250
- Fred, who is Simon?
- A friend of Theresa's, he says.

658
00:39:11,310 --> 00:39:14,570
Oh, shit.
He better hope Jamal don't find out.

659
00:39:14,830 --> 00:39:17,200
- Be right with you, sir.
- Great.

660
00:39:24,530 --> 00:39:26,670
- Jerry? Hey.
- Simon, what's up?

661
00:39:27,630 --> 00:39:31,760
Listen. I need you to get me into that
nanotech IPO. I want 10 blocks.

662
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:33,130
That's $50,000!

663
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:35,370
Did you inherit a boatload or something?

664
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:39,120
The initial public offering comes out
on Tuesday. What do you expect me to do?

665
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:42,480
I know when it comes out.
I set the damn date, okay?

666
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:44,960
Just buy it for me on margin.

667
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:47,210
Dude, you don't work here anymore.

668
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:51,180
I need this IPO to hold me over
until I get another job.

669
00:39:51,250 --> 00:39:53,290
I know you're really screwed right now...

670
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:55,460
but do you even have $50,000?

671
00:39:55,850 --> 00:39:59,470
I'm gonna sell off my IRAs, okay?
I'll have it in 10 days.

672
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:01,000
I can't do margin.

673
00:40:01,330 --> 00:40:02,630
I need cash.

674
00:40:02,730 --> 00:40:05,550
I'm in Jersey right now.
Where am I gonna get cash?

675
00:40:05,610 --> 00:40:08,160
I'm sure one of those chemical plants
has an ATM machine.

676
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:10,790
All right, look. I'll get the cash.
Just put in the order.

677
00:40:10,860 --> 00:40:12,350
Cash by Tuesday.

678
00:40:12,430 --> 00:40:14,280
I'll bring it to you personally on Monday.

679
00:40:14,350 --> 00:40:16,070
Don't punk out on me.

680
00:40:18,190 --> 00:40:19,400
- Hey.
- Hey.

681
00:40:19,530 --> 00:40:21,420
What are you doing here?

682
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:24,710
I feel like we didn't get off
on the right foot yesterday...

683
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:26,720
so I thought maybe...

684
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:29,730
I'd come here and take you to lunch.
Maybe we could bond a little.

685
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:34,020
I think we bonded just fine around 3:10 this
morning when your knee was in my crotch.

686
00:40:34,090 --> 00:40:35,370
Right.

687
00:40:35,790 --> 00:40:37,000
I'll buy.

688
00:40:38,310 --> 00:40:40,070
- You want to buy me lunch?
- Yeah.

689
00:40:40,140 --> 00:40:44,200
I figured it's the proper thing to do
after sleeping with each other.

690
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:48,930
Okay.

691
00:40:53,130 --> 00:40:56,000
- So, nice bank.
- I'm glad you like it.

692
00:40:57,030 --> 00:41:01,130
I like the small-town feel.
It's less complicated.

693
00:41:01,190 --> 00:41:04,130
Somebody needs money,
they just come in and say:

694
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:06,730
"Percy, I need a loan."

695
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:08,290
Right?

696
00:41:09,610 --> 00:41:12,710
And then, of course, you say,
"Well, yeah. How much?"

697
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:16,760
They say, "I don't know.
You tell me. $50,000?"

698
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:19,010
What, you need $50,000?

699
00:41:19,530 --> 00:41:21,440
- Do I need $50,000?
- Yeah.

700
00:41:22,540 --> 00:41:25,150
No. I most assuredly do not.

701
00:41:25,830 --> 00:41:28,040
I was just admiring the process.

702
00:41:36,740 --> 00:41:39,870
How many cylinders does a NASCAR engine
have, six or eight?

703
00:41:39,940 --> 00:41:41,220
- How...
- Yeah.

704
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:43,620
Six... or eight...

705
00:41:46,150 --> 00:41:50,910
depending on the gas mileage
consumption of the automobile.

706
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:54,850
You never worked in the pit at NASCAR.
You might as well admit it.

707
00:41:55,620 --> 00:41:57,860
All right, you know, fine.

708
00:42:00,070 --> 00:42:02,750
I never really had an aptitude for engines.

709
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:04,410
Jay... Jeff...

710
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:08,830
Jeff Gordon didn't really trust me
in the pit that much.

711
00:42:09,350 --> 00:42:10,940
But you did drive the cars.

712
00:42:11,050 --> 00:42:12,450
- Drive?
- Yeah.

713
00:42:12,870 --> 00:42:14,810
- Absolutely.
- Good.

714
00:42:35,810 --> 00:42:38,710
All right! Fine! I never drove NASCAR!

715
00:42:39,110 --> 00:42:41,590
But I was nervous
and I wanted to impress you.

716
00:42:41,670 --> 00:42:43,560
You shouldn't have lied.

717
00:42:44,420 --> 00:42:48,190
All right. This is the deal.
We go one lap around.

718
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:51,520
If you beat me, I'll loan you the money.

719
00:42:53,820 --> 00:42:57,340
- Really?
- I knew it! I knew you needed the money.

720
00:42:57,410 --> 00:42:59,230
I don't need the money!

721
00:43:26,620 --> 00:43:28,150
Move over!

722
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:36,470
Yeah. Fool!

723
00:43:49,730 --> 00:43:50,870
Sucker!

724
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:32,060
Move it, man!

725
00:44:33,980 --> 00:44:36,020
What the hell are you doing?

726
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:46,520
- I think it's obvious who came in first.
- You're doggone right. You know I won.

727
00:44:46,870 --> 00:44:51,350
- I was through the bushes before...
- I was through first. I had more speed.

728
00:44:51,420 --> 00:44:53,520
I was through the bushes
and on the asphalt...

729
00:44:53,590 --> 00:44:56,340
- before you even were at the bushes.
- Look.

730
00:44:58,330 --> 00:44:59,990
Dispatch, this is 53 Charlie.

731
00:45:00,060 --> 00:45:03,120
Brian, we got a problem.
Two cars have jumped...

732
00:45:06,650 --> 00:45:08,560
License and registration.

733
00:45:12,700 --> 00:45:15,060
- Poppy!
- There's my beautiful girl.

734
00:45:16,410 --> 00:45:18,200
Simon, I want you to meet my granddad.

735
00:45:18,270 --> 00:45:21,080
- Hi, there. Howard Jones.
- Simon Green. Good to meet you, sir.

736
00:45:21,140 --> 00:45:22,570
Nice to meet you.

737
00:45:22,650 --> 00:45:24,440
- Hey, Speed Racer.
- Hey!

738
00:45:24,540 --> 00:45:27,760
- What's with the white kid?
- That's Simon. He's my boyfriend.

739
00:45:27,830 --> 00:45:30,130
Your boyfriend?
You didn't tell me he was white.

740
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:31,380
- Yes, I did.
- When?

741
00:45:31,450 --> 00:45:33,420
- Back at the home.
- I thought you was kidding.

742
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:35,380
Okay. Well, I think that's it.

743
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:38,190
I think you're forgetting about the vodka.

744
00:45:38,260 --> 00:45:39,820
Say grace, Percy.

745
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:44,080
Thank you, Lord. Amen.

746
00:45:45,910 --> 00:45:48,530
- That was fast.
- The Lord knows I'm busy.

747
00:45:48,730 --> 00:45:51,690
- Simon, pass on the broccoli, please.
- Yes, sir.

748
00:45:51,890 --> 00:45:55,310
So, what, they don't have any available
young black men in New York anymore?

749
00:45:55,380 --> 00:45:57,450
They just ran out last week, Grandpa.

750
00:45:57,530 --> 00:46:00,970
I'm just trying to figure out
why you chose to go this way.

751
00:46:01,050 --> 00:46:03,250
- Don't mind him.
- It's okay.

752
00:46:03,570 --> 00:46:05,610
My grandmother loved you
when she first met you.

753
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:08,530
But later she said some things.
I was like, "Wow, Grandma."

754
00:46:09,270 --> 00:46:11,950
- What kind of things?
- Yeah, what kind of things?

755
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:14,190
Nothing. Just things.

756
00:46:14,870 --> 00:46:16,490
- Such as?
- Yeah, such as?

757
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:18,600
- Daddy? I got it.
- I know.

758
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:24,370
You know what?
You're gonna laugh when you hear this.

759
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:27,730
She said that Theresa was a very pretty girl.

760
00:46:29,330 --> 00:46:31,090
- That's so nice.
- Good taste.

761
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:34,730
So I ask her
what she liked about you the most, right?

762
00:46:34,870 --> 00:46:36,010
She said...

763
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:39,790
She says, "I just love
her cute, little, nappy little head."

764
00:46:44,750 --> 00:46:47,660
- Your grandmother, where does she live?
- Brooklyn. Why?

765
00:46:47,730 --> 00:46:51,720
I just wanna know how far I'd have to travel
to kick her old white ass, that's why!

766
00:46:51,790 --> 00:46:53,000
Grandpa.

767
00:46:53,230 --> 00:46:55,340
You don't call my grandchild
no nappy head!

768
00:46:55,410 --> 00:46:58,470
Did she say that while putting on a sheet
for the Klan rally?

769
00:46:58,540 --> 00:47:00,910
Settle down, now! Hand me the butter.

770
00:47:00,980 --> 00:47:03,910
- My grandmother's not a malicious woman.
- No, she's not.

771
00:47:03,980 --> 00:47:06,770
She's 82. She comes from a different time.

772
00:47:06,830 --> 00:47:08,810
I'm 74 and I come from a different time.

773
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:11,430
You don't hear me calling white folks
honky and flat-ass!

774
00:47:11,510 --> 00:47:12,810
- Casper.
- Cracker.

775
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:14,310
- Ofay.
- Peckerwood.

776
00:47:14,380 --> 00:47:16,040
- Wonder bread.
- Bird shit.

777
00:47:16,110 --> 00:47:17,260
Bird shit?

778
00:47:17,330 --> 00:47:18,950
It's almost white.

779
00:47:19,470 --> 00:47:20,580
That's pretty good.

780
00:47:20,660 --> 00:47:22,760
Howard. Percy!

781
00:47:25,170 --> 00:47:26,440
It's okay.

782
00:47:26,860 --> 00:47:29,930
I'm really sorry
about what my grandmother said...

783
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:32,940
but there are some people
you're just never gonna change...

784
00:47:33,010 --> 00:47:34,860
- as much as you'd like to.
- Yep.

785
00:47:34,930 --> 00:47:37,540
I can tell you this. Last Thanksgiving...

786
00:47:37,810 --> 00:47:40,650
my Uncle Dave said a black joke
at the table, right?

787
00:47:40,970 --> 00:47:44,770
So I said, right in front of the whole family,
"Look, that's inappropriate.

788
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:46,820
"We're not gonna have it."

789
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:52,260
I think that's how you change people.
You just gotta attack it one at a time.

790
00:47:52,330 --> 00:47:53,350
Exactly.

791
00:47:53,420 --> 00:47:54,950
What was the joke?

792
00:47:55,500 --> 00:47:56,750
Excuse me?

793
00:47:58,090 --> 00:47:59,430
Tell the joke.

794
00:48:00,140 --> 00:48:02,860
- I don't remember it.
- Sure you do. Tell the joke.

795
00:48:03,090 --> 00:48:05,960
- Really, I don't remember it. It was...
- Dad.

796
00:48:06,190 --> 00:48:07,370
Chicken.

797
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:10,630
- Excuse me?
- I didn't stutter.

798
00:48:10,700 --> 00:48:13,730
Okay, you know what? I'll tell the joke.

799
00:48:13,870 --> 00:48:16,490
- No, Simon. You don't...
- Baby, it's okay.

800
00:48:16,750 --> 00:48:18,180
I'll tell you why.

801
00:48:18,250 --> 00:48:22,250
Because by not telling the joke,
I'm empowering it. Right? So I'll just...

802
00:48:23,270 --> 00:48:26,660
tell the joke and expose
how simple-minded...

803
00:48:27,080 --> 00:48:30,050
and crude and unfunny it actually is.

804
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:33,890
What do you call...

805
00:48:38,790 --> 00:48:41,930
What do you call 100 black men...

806
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:44,960
buried in the ground up to their neck?

807
00:48:46,190 --> 00:48:48,160
- What?
- Afro-Turf.

808
00:48:51,150 --> 00:48:53,450
- That's cute.
- What are you laughing at?

809
00:48:53,550 --> 00:48:56,030
- It's cute.
- Cute don't make it funny.

810
00:48:56,490 --> 00:48:57,630
Tell another.

811
00:48:57,740 --> 00:49:00,070
- Dad, no.
- Let the man tell a joke!

812
00:49:00,870 --> 00:49:02,910
I don't know any other ones.

813
00:49:04,780 --> 00:49:09,510
Obviously, I've heard other black jokes,
but I think I've proven my point.

814
00:49:09,610 --> 00:49:12,000
So it's okay to empower the other ones?

815
00:49:12,490 --> 00:49:16,350
Okay. I see what you're doing here,
you're putting me on the spot.

816
00:49:16,420 --> 00:49:19,520
It's okay. Look, it's fine.
'Cause I'm not gonna back down.

817
00:49:19,590 --> 00:49:20,770
Back down, Simon.

818
00:49:20,840 --> 00:49:24,520
The only way to break down barriers
is to have everything out in the open.

819
00:49:24,580 --> 00:49:25,830
- Right?
- Exactly.

820
00:49:25,900 --> 00:49:27,780
So, what do you call...

821
00:49:28,550 --> 00:49:32,350
one black man being chased
by 300 white men?

822
00:49:33,130 --> 00:49:35,610
- What?
- The PGA Tour.

823
00:49:37,030 --> 00:49:38,460
I get it.

824
00:49:38,530 --> 00:49:39,910
Tiger Woods. There it is.

825
00:49:40,010 --> 00:49:41,380
That's good.

826
00:49:42,090 --> 00:49:43,650
Tell another one.

827
00:49:46,310 --> 00:49:49,540
How do we know that Adam and Eve
weren't black?

828
00:49:50,530 --> 00:49:51,480
How?

829
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:54,620
You ever try to take a rib away
from a black man?

830
00:49:57,410 --> 00:49:58,560
That's pretty good.

831
00:49:58,630 --> 00:50:02,140
- That's pretty good.
- I wouldn't take one from you, I know that!

832
00:50:02,210 --> 00:50:05,410
- You chewing it down to the bone.
- That's a good one.

833
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:08,990
- He's a rib fan.
- Don't try.

834
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:10,690
- Tell more.
- Okay.

835
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:13,060
- Why don't black people like country music?
- Why?

836
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:17,570
'Cause every time they say "hoe-down,"
they think someone shot their sister.

837
00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:23,140
You gonna be all right?

838
00:50:26,020 --> 00:50:27,550
That is so true.

839
00:50:27,650 --> 00:50:30,780
- That's a tailored joke for you.
- Why I gotta be a ho?

840
00:50:30,850 --> 00:50:32,670
Ain't nobody talking about you.

841
00:50:32,740 --> 00:50:34,430
- It's a sister joke!
- You're sisters.

842
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:36,090
I'm not the "ho sister."

843
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:38,500
Come on now. Can't stop now, baby.

844
00:50:38,980 --> 00:50:41,830
What are three things
that a black man can't get?

845
00:50:41,890 --> 00:50:43,990
What is that he can't he get?

846
00:50:45,380 --> 00:50:48,670
A black eye, a fat lip, and a job.

847
00:50:54,690 --> 00:50:57,020
I tell you I'm going to kick this boy's ass!

848
00:50:57,090 --> 00:50:59,770
- Grandpa.
- No, it's...

849
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:03,780
We know you can take him,
but just sit down. Be nice. Come on.

850
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:07,740
- Come on, now. It's a joke.
- That's right, Daddy.

851
00:51:07,810 --> 00:51:09,810
Sit down. It's just a joke.

852
00:51:10,140 --> 00:51:12,860
Come on. Hee-hee, ha-ha. That's all it is.

853
00:51:16,290 --> 00:51:18,230
Now if you'll excuse me...

854
00:51:18,850 --> 00:51:20,950
all of a sudden, I lost my appetite.

855
00:51:24,510 --> 00:51:26,330
Think I'll take a walk.

856
00:51:35,420 --> 00:51:38,620
- I should have stopped at "hoe-down."
- You should have never started.

857
00:51:38,690 --> 00:51:41,880
This isn't like us at home,
laughing about this bullshit.

858
00:51:41,950 --> 00:51:43,740
It's my father's house, Simon.

859
00:51:43,810 --> 00:51:46,770
What do you want me to do,
go upstairs and apologize to him again?

860
00:51:46,850 --> 00:51:47,860
No.

861
00:51:48,890 --> 00:51:51,130
Let the storm pass. It'll be fine.

862
00:51:52,730 --> 00:51:54,140
Besides, he dared you!

863
00:51:54,210 --> 00:51:56,340
- He double-dared! He called me chicken.
- I heard!

864
00:51:56,410 --> 00:51:59,710
- I can't be called chicken.
- You have to watch him on those.

865
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:04,470
You know? I'm fresh out of ideas
as to how to impress your father.

866
00:52:05,020 --> 00:52:08,250
Telling black jokes is never a good idea,
but that's just me.

867
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:09,590
You think?

868
00:52:15,610 --> 00:52:17,170
I'll talk to him.

869
00:52:21,820 --> 00:52:23,280
Say nice things about me.

870
00:52:23,350 --> 00:52:26,700
No, I'm not going to say nice things
about you. You are still punished.

871
00:52:26,810 --> 00:52:30,640
Baby, I'm a good guy.
I like ribs, too. I don't...

872
00:52:33,370 --> 00:52:35,230
Why are you being so mean to me?

873
00:52:35,290 --> 00:52:37,810
- My grandfather's out there.
- He's not going to come in.

874
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:40,400
- This is my mom's kitchen!
- She's not going to come in.

875
00:52:40,470 --> 00:52:42,780
You're still gonna do the dishes.

876
00:52:44,030 --> 00:52:46,550
- Get off me.
- Fine, I'll do the dishes.

877
00:52:47,030 --> 00:52:48,980
Here, do the broccoli one.

878
00:52:51,900 --> 00:52:54,770
- Dad, I have to talk to you.
- What?

879
00:52:55,100 --> 00:52:57,910
- Why did you do that?
- I didn't start it. Mr. Nappy Head did.

880
00:52:57,980 --> 00:53:00,600
Dad, Simon's a good man.
He has a good heart.

881
00:53:00,670 --> 00:53:02,800
- A good man?
- You put him on the spot.

882
00:53:02,870 --> 00:53:04,080
You really think so?

883
00:53:04,150 --> 00:53:06,060
What is your problem with him anyways?

884
00:53:06,140 --> 00:53:08,620
Besides the fact, of course, that he's white.

885
00:53:08,700 --> 00:53:12,240
You gonna get in a heap of trouble
talking to me like that.

886
00:53:12,540 --> 00:53:15,950
Don't care nothing about that man
being white. He's hiding something.

887
00:53:16,030 --> 00:53:17,430
What? NASCAR?

888
00:53:18,780 --> 00:53:20,750
You thought I didn't know?

889
00:53:21,080 --> 00:53:24,910
Of course I knew.
We talk about everything, Simon and I.

890
00:53:26,550 --> 00:53:29,970
Daddy, I love him,
and you need to start respecting that.

891
00:53:30,390 --> 00:53:33,840
Then you respect me enough to tell me
in advance who you're bringing home.

892
00:53:33,910 --> 00:53:36,280
- I didn't think you'd care.
- But you weren't sure.

893
00:53:36,340 --> 00:53:38,480
- So you decided to test me.
- No, of course not.

894
00:53:38,550 --> 00:53:40,110
- So you're looking for a reaction?
- No.

895
00:53:40,180 --> 00:53:41,460
So what are you looking for?

896
00:53:41,530 --> 00:53:45,520
I'm looking for you to tell me
that it's okay for me to be with him.

897
00:53:53,650 --> 00:53:54,960
I'm scared.

898
00:53:56,790 --> 00:53:57,840
Okay?

899
00:53:58,740 --> 00:54:00,560
I'm really scared, Dad.

900
00:54:01,330 --> 00:54:04,560
I know things are different now
and times have changed...

901
00:54:04,630 --> 00:54:08,370
but you should really hear the kind of things
that people say to us sometimes.

902
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:10,480
And the way they look at us.

903
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:16,080
I need you to tell me
that it's okay to be with him.

904
00:54:17,560 --> 00:54:21,100
Baby, me telling you it's okay
is not gonna change the world.

905
00:54:21,170 --> 00:54:23,510
Dad. But it would change my world.

906
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:27,140
It will change my world
if I know that you're behind us.

907
00:54:27,220 --> 00:54:29,550
I'm always behind you, sweetheart.

908
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:32,210
And I love you.

909
00:54:33,390 --> 00:54:35,500
It's my job to keep you safe.

910
00:54:36,430 --> 00:54:38,440
And I don't trust that kid.

911
00:54:55,410 --> 00:54:57,070
- Hey, baby.
- Yes.

912
00:54:57,170 --> 00:55:00,710
I'm trying to figure out where he got
all those doggone black jokes.

913
00:55:00,780 --> 00:55:03,050
What do white people do, take a class...

914
00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:05,510
sit around and think of new jokes
about the black man?

915
00:55:05,580 --> 00:55:07,280
I don't know, Percy.

916
00:55:07,570 --> 00:55:09,610
You need to let that one go.

917
00:55:10,220 --> 00:55:13,670
Come on, sweetheart.
We need to practice the tango.

918
00:55:13,750 --> 00:55:15,880
I told you. I ain't doing no doggone tango.

919
00:55:15,950 --> 00:55:18,700
Why? You think you can't dance anymore?

920
00:55:18,770 --> 00:55:22,180
No. I think the tango's a stupid dance
and I ain't doing it.

921
00:55:24,430 --> 00:55:25,710
Marilyn...

922
00:55:26,830 --> 00:55:30,250
why can't we do the hustle?
What's wrong with the hustle?

923
00:55:30,670 --> 00:55:33,840
Because the hustle is a stupid dance...

924
00:55:33,900 --> 00:55:35,910
and I want to do the tango.

925
00:55:39,980 --> 00:55:42,400
Look here, woman,
can't we do this some other time?

926
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:44,810
I gotta take Dad back to the home.

927
00:55:47,310 --> 00:55:49,000
- I'll be back.
- Okay.

928
00:57:37,380 --> 00:57:38,330
Shut up!

929
00:57:41,730 --> 00:57:44,930
All right, stop.
Okay, move a little to your left.

930
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:46,620
- Okay.
- All right, kiss me.

931
00:57:46,690 --> 00:57:49,540
This is the exact spot
where I had my first kiss.

932
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:53,570
No! I'm not going to kiss you in the spot
that you had your first kiss.

933
00:57:53,830 --> 00:57:55,970
- No.
- Why not?

934
00:57:56,520 --> 00:57:59,040
It's some other guy's spot.

935
00:58:00,070 --> 00:58:01,080
Fine.

936
00:58:02,150 --> 00:58:04,040
- What was his name?
- Curtis Booker.

937
00:58:04,100 --> 00:58:06,370
He had these big old Bucky Beaver teeth.

938
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:09,470
But he was such a nice boy.
He was a good kisser, too.

939
00:58:09,640 --> 00:58:12,120
- Better than me?
- Way better.

940
00:58:12,390 --> 00:58:13,820
- Way better?
- Yeah.

941
00:58:13,890 --> 00:58:15,680
- Did he grab your ass?
- No.

942
00:58:15,750 --> 00:58:17,630
- Squeeze it?
- No. We were 13.

943
00:58:17,700 --> 00:58:20,070
- Grab you down here?
- No. Come on!

944
00:58:22,950 --> 00:58:24,770
- Slow down.
- Come on.

945
00:58:27,430 --> 00:58:31,000
- There's a car! Get out of the way!
- Come on! Yeah!

946
00:58:37,120 --> 00:58:38,680
Okay, be careful.

947
00:58:42,180 --> 00:58:44,090
So, this is my favorite spot.

948
00:58:45,950 --> 00:58:47,860
It's pretty amazing, huh?

949
00:58:48,550 --> 00:58:50,550
All right, so it's not...

950
00:58:50,630 --> 00:58:53,690
the top of the world, but it's nice.

951
00:58:55,680 --> 00:58:57,060
It's a fort.

952
00:58:58,980 --> 00:59:00,700
It's a gun placement.

953
00:59:01,350 --> 00:59:04,990
When I was little, I would sneak
out of the house in the middle of the night...

954
00:59:05,060 --> 00:59:09,150
and just come out here and just dream.

955
00:59:09,660 --> 00:59:10,740
Yeah?

956
00:59:11,710 --> 00:59:14,130
Weren't you afraid of sneaking
out of your house?

957
00:59:14,210 --> 00:59:16,630
Please. I'm not afraid of Percy Jones.

958
00:59:17,830 --> 00:59:21,720
Well, that makes you and... you.

959
00:59:25,470 --> 00:59:27,680
Okay, so this is just Cranford.

960
00:59:28,380 --> 00:59:32,440
But it's a great place to grow up.
It's a good place to raise a family, too.

961
00:59:36,320 --> 00:59:38,810
You know, maybe we shouldn't do this.

962
00:59:39,100 --> 00:59:41,040
What? Live in the suburbs?

963
00:59:41,370 --> 00:59:44,920
No. Tell your parents
about our engagement this weekend.

964
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:49,650
Simon, I told you not to look at him
straight in the eye.

965
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:54,010
I don't think Percy Jones is ready.

966
00:59:54,430 --> 00:59:56,850
I think Percy Jones needs more time.

967
00:59:57,310 --> 00:59:59,550
A lot more time for Percy Jones.

968
01:00:00,220 --> 01:00:02,640
- Are you getting cold feet, Simon?
- No.

969
01:00:04,190 --> 01:00:06,330
No, I'm not getting cold feet.

970
01:00:07,130 --> 01:00:09,070
I can't wait to marry you.

971
01:00:10,170 --> 01:00:11,900
Make babies with you.

972
01:00:13,950 --> 01:00:16,760
Give me a daughter that looks just like you.

973
01:00:20,990 --> 01:00:22,580
I can work on that.

974
01:00:22,650 --> 01:00:23,990
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

975
01:00:24,830 --> 01:00:27,510
And hopefully, I can be a good dad.

976
01:00:28,440 --> 01:00:30,580
I think you'll be a great dad.

977
01:00:30,750 --> 01:00:33,620
You're never gonna be
like your father, Simon.

978
01:00:37,470 --> 01:00:39,410
Maybe I can be like yours.

979
01:00:39,520 --> 01:00:41,010
- Like Percy?
- Yeah.

980
01:00:41,080 --> 01:00:43,570
- No.
- Baby, Percy Jones is a good dad.

981
01:00:44,350 --> 01:00:46,000
He's there for you.

982
01:00:46,230 --> 01:00:48,920
He cares about you. He loves you so much.

983
01:00:49,240 --> 01:00:50,420
He does.

984
01:00:51,550 --> 01:00:53,370
We just have to get him to love you.

985
01:00:53,430 --> 01:00:57,840
Maybe we can start by getting him to take
the padlock off the basement door.

986
01:00:58,710 --> 01:01:00,620
It's not going to happen.

987
01:01:02,420 --> 01:01:04,330
Why don't you give me
a little Curtis Booker?

988
01:01:04,410 --> 01:01:05,900
I can't believe I told you that.

989
01:01:05,980 --> 01:01:08,690
- Come on, baby, a little Bucky Beaver?
- No.

990
01:01:09,020 --> 01:01:11,410
No. How about some Simon Green?

991
01:01:46,650 --> 01:01:49,130
Marilyn, you cut off the porch light?

992
01:01:55,090 --> 01:01:56,560
That's my girl.

993
01:02:04,050 --> 01:02:05,460
Very stylish.

994
01:02:05,970 --> 01:02:09,680
I need to take a quarter inch off the pants.
I can do it here. Let me have them.

995
01:02:09,750 --> 01:02:11,310
What, you mean take the pants off?

996
01:02:11,380 --> 01:02:14,700
I could do with you in them
but I don't want to poke you with my needle.

997
01:02:14,770 --> 01:02:17,590
You keep your eyes on the pants,
you hear me?

998
01:02:27,800 --> 01:02:30,540
Mr. Jones, do you know
where the extra chairs are?

999
01:02:30,610 --> 01:02:32,650
What are you, blind?
They're against the wall.

1000
01:02:32,720 --> 01:02:34,860
- When you go out, close the door.
- Right.

1001
01:02:34,930 --> 01:02:37,710
Percy, put some pants on.
We got people in the house.

1002
01:02:37,780 --> 01:02:40,330
- Thank you.
- Thank you, sweetheart. I didn't realize.

1003
01:02:41,270 --> 01:02:42,510
How long's it gonna take?

1004
01:02:42,580 --> 01:02:45,260
- Two shakes of a lamb's tail.
- Whatever the hell that means.

1005
01:02:45,330 --> 01:02:47,440
Mercy, Percy! Keep your shirt on!

1006
01:02:47,510 --> 01:02:49,410
Or take it off. Whatever.

1007
01:02:49,680 --> 01:02:53,030
Could someone answer
that damn phone? Thank you!

1008
01:02:56,140 --> 01:02:59,010
- Jones residence.
- This is Reggie. Who's this?

1009
01:03:00,110 --> 01:03:04,650
- This is Theresa's boyfriend.
- Jamal! What's up, man?

1010
01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:07,690
- Percy told me all about you.
- What's that?

1011
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:10,890
My name is Reggie.
Percy told me all about you, man.

1012
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:12,010
He did?

1013
01:03:12,080 --> 01:03:16,110
You know what we should do?
Get together and play some hoops, man.

1014
01:03:16,590 --> 01:03:18,500
I don't really play hoops.

1015
01:03:18,800 --> 01:03:21,260
Come on, man. Don't be shy.
Why are you being shy?

1016
01:03:21,330 --> 01:03:25,290
Percy told me that you went to Howard.
He said you almost went pro.

1017
01:03:25,490 --> 01:03:26,860
- He said that?
- Yeah.

1018
01:03:26,930 --> 01:03:30,640
He was bragging all about you, Jamal.
But listen...

1019
01:03:30,700 --> 01:03:33,870
two things.
One: Could you autograph the issue...

1020
01:03:33,930 --> 01:03:37,760
of Jet for me? And the other thing is,
I would love to meet the Cosbys.

1021
01:03:37,840 --> 01:03:41,480
When I say love to meet them,
I mean I love to meet them.

1022
01:03:41,740 --> 01:03:44,460
- I'll see what I can do.
- I feel like I grew up with them.

1023
01:03:44,530 --> 01:03:45,930
Let me get Percy for you.

1024
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,680
You know, in the '80s and whatnot and...

1025
01:03:48,750 --> 01:03:52,430
- It's for you. It's Reggie.
- We were talking about the Cosbys.

1026
01:03:52,530 --> 01:03:55,590
- May I have some privacy, please?
- But, yeah, you know what I mean?

1027
01:03:56,050 --> 01:03:58,120
- And shut the door.
- I'd still love to meet them.

1028
01:03:58,640 --> 01:03:59,590
Theo...

1029
01:04:01,450 --> 01:04:03,180
Reggie. What did you find out?

1030
01:04:03,240 --> 01:04:06,720
You were right about Simon Green.
He is no longer at J.P. Oliver.

1031
01:04:06,800 --> 01:04:08,740
Come on. Give me my pants.

1032
01:04:09,290 --> 01:04:11,460
- Jamal, huh?
- Don't start.

1033
01:04:11,530 --> 01:04:15,430
This isn't about me. It's about you
and your job, that you don't have anymore.

1034
01:04:15,500 --> 01:04:18,180
- What?
- Yeah. Move out of my way.

1035
01:04:18,410 --> 01:04:19,690
Hey, baby!

1036
01:04:20,430 --> 01:04:23,150
Theresa! Come here, sweetheart.
Daddy needs to talk to you.

1037
01:04:23,210 --> 01:04:25,860
- Don't listen to him.
- What are you talking about?

1038
01:04:25,930 --> 01:04:29,350
Your boyfriend's unemployed, lost his job.
He got fired a couple days ago.

1039
01:04:29,420 --> 01:04:31,080
I did not get fired! I quit!

1040
01:04:31,150 --> 01:04:33,250
You quit? Why didn't you tell me this?

1041
01:04:33,320 --> 01:04:36,260
- It's complicated.
- It's complicated when you're a liar.

1042
01:04:36,330 --> 01:04:40,450
I'm a liar?
What about the lies you told Reggie?

1043
01:04:40,590 --> 01:04:42,050
- Jamal?
- Who's Jamal?

1044
01:04:42,120 --> 01:04:44,680
- He's good friends with the Cosbys.
- What about NASCAR?

1045
01:04:44,750 --> 01:04:47,080
That was nothing, and I admitted it.

1046
01:04:47,150 --> 01:04:50,280
- You admitted that you lied.
- You tried to kill me with a go-kart.

1047
01:04:50,350 --> 01:04:51,970
At least I can drive.

1048
01:04:52,040 --> 01:04:55,040
This crazy ass almost got us arrested.
Now we both got court dates.

1049
01:04:55,110 --> 01:04:56,900
I can't believe you checked up on me.

1050
01:04:56,970 --> 01:04:59,720
- You kept asking me for money.
- I never asked you for money.

1051
01:04:59,790 --> 01:05:03,170
- You asked my father for money?
- $50,000 loan, baby.

1052
01:05:03,240 --> 01:05:05,610
- I did not. He trapped me into it.
- You're a liar.

1053
01:05:05,670 --> 01:05:07,360
You were checking up on him?

1054
01:05:07,430 --> 01:05:10,020
He forced my hand.
You're my daughter and he's not worthy!

1055
01:05:10,090 --> 01:05:11,650
- That's not for you to decide.
- Right!

1056
01:05:11,720 --> 01:05:14,540
And what about you, lying to me?
You said you would never lie.

1057
01:05:14,600 --> 01:05:16,060
You ain't gotta go over there.

1058
01:05:16,140 --> 01:05:17,510
I thought I could get another job.

1059
01:05:17,580 --> 01:05:20,480
I was gonna tell you,
but I didn't want to ruin the big weekend.

1060
01:05:20,550 --> 01:05:22,820
You said we would
always tell each other the truth.

1061
01:05:22,890 --> 01:05:25,950
Like how you told your parents
about me being white?

1062
01:05:26,020 --> 01:05:29,730
- I knew they wouldn't care about that.
- I don't care. I care that you're a liar.

1063
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:33,830
That's bullshit! You care.
He has to care. It's human nature.

1064
01:05:34,410 --> 01:05:36,380
That means that you care that I'm black?

1065
01:05:36,450 --> 01:05:38,210
- Do you?
- Dad!

1066
01:05:39,910 --> 01:05:43,260
No. It doesn't matter what I say.
You people are gonna think I'm a racist.

1067
01:05:43,330 --> 01:05:46,910
- You hear that? "You people."
- I know. I heard. What people?

1068
01:05:47,940 --> 01:05:49,800
The people in the yard.

1069
01:05:52,550 --> 01:05:55,520
That's what I'm... See?
I say one thing and I'm a racist!

1070
01:05:55,590 --> 01:05:58,370
- No, Simon, you're a liar.
- And a racist.

1071
01:05:59,270 --> 01:06:02,400
Where do you get off calling me a racist?
I have a black girlfriend!

1072
01:06:02,470 --> 01:06:04,770
- You had a black girlfriend!
- Have.

1073
01:06:04,840 --> 01:06:07,360
Past tense! Had!
And let me tell you something else, son...

1074
01:06:07,430 --> 01:06:10,080
- What the hell is going on?
- I'll tell you what's going on.

1075
01:06:10,150 --> 01:06:13,730
- He got fired from J.P. Oliver!
- I did not get fired! I quit!

1076
01:06:13,800 --> 01:06:16,220
- I told you to stay out of Theresa's life.
- Thank you.

1077
01:06:16,290 --> 01:06:18,880
He can't just walk in our house,
telling our baby lies.

1078
01:06:18,950 --> 01:06:21,340
- I'm not lying!
- I don't think so!

1079
01:06:22,150 --> 01:06:25,280
- The party's off, Percy.
- Woman, you must be crazy.

1080
01:06:25,350 --> 01:06:28,410
I don't want to say my vows with you.
It would be a lie before God.

1081
01:06:28,480 --> 01:06:30,720
Marilyn, we're saying
some goddamn vows tomorrow.

1082
01:06:30,790 --> 01:06:34,170
- Yeah, he got a book and everything.
- Would you shut up?

1083
01:06:34,590 --> 01:06:36,190
You got your vows out of a book?

1084
01:06:36,260 --> 01:06:40,030
No. Don't listen to him! I got a book.
I'm using it for inspiration.

1085
01:06:40,100 --> 01:06:42,750
- He wrote it down word for word.
- You're going to get hurt.

1086
01:06:42,820 --> 01:06:44,830
- That is so pathetic!
- Come on, Marilyn!

1087
01:06:44,900 --> 01:06:48,310
Because if memory serves me correctly,
I used to be inspiration enough.

1088
01:06:48,390 --> 01:06:49,600
You still are!

1089
01:06:49,670 --> 01:06:51,710
You'd be inspiration to me. He neglects you.

1090
01:06:51,780 --> 01:06:54,260
Marilyn, get your ass back here!

1091
01:06:54,340 --> 01:06:56,570
I got a $200 cake coming tomorrow!

1092
01:06:56,640 --> 01:07:00,190
Sixty pounds of shrimp!
Sixty pounds of shrimp, woman!

1093
01:07:00,260 --> 01:07:02,080
I had to take a second on the house!

1094
01:07:02,140 --> 01:07:05,460
- She looked angry.
- Marilyn, don't let me raise my voice now!

1095
01:07:05,540 --> 01:07:07,160
You gonna force me to use the muscle!

1096
01:07:07,230 --> 01:07:08,540
Hope you like seafood.

1097
01:07:16,220 --> 01:07:17,630
Theresa! Wait!

1098
01:07:20,740 --> 01:07:21,910
Come on!

1099
01:07:23,460 --> 01:07:25,560
- They'll be back.
- No, they're not coming back.

1100
01:07:25,630 --> 01:07:28,050
They gotta come back.
Sixty pounds of shrimp!

1101
01:07:28,130 --> 01:07:30,070
Come on, baby. Pick it up.

1102
01:07:31,900 --> 01:07:35,280
Answer that phone, sweetheart,
and it will be your last.

1103
01:07:37,950 --> 01:07:39,380
Let me borrow your car.

1104
01:07:39,460 --> 01:07:43,000
What? You can't go chasing behind
no women. Have some dignity!

1105
01:07:43,070 --> 01:07:45,180
Besides, you can't even drive
a damn go-kart!

1106
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:51,130
Trouble in paradise?

1107
01:08:05,820 --> 01:08:08,120
Baby, we need to talk about this.

1108
01:08:08,320 --> 01:08:10,900
You should call me
and we should talk about it like adults...

1109
01:08:10,970 --> 01:08:13,390
because adults communicate
when they have problems.

1110
01:08:13,470 --> 01:08:16,950
I'm looking at your photos on the wall
and they're beautiful.

1111
01:08:17,630 --> 01:08:21,750
Beautiful photos. I don't think that
I compliment you on your work enough.

1112
01:08:21,820 --> 01:08:26,460
You know what? You're being rude.
That's what you're being. So call me back.

1113
01:08:29,150 --> 01:08:31,000
Baby, I'm sorry. You're not being rude.

1114
01:08:31,070 --> 01:08:34,070
You have all the reason in the world
to be upset with me right now.

1115
01:08:34,140 --> 01:08:38,160
You shouldn't be calling me back.
If I was you, I wouldn't call me back.

1116
01:08:38,460 --> 01:08:40,120
Baby, call me back.

1117
01:08:40,830 --> 01:08:42,100
Call me back, baby.

1118
01:08:42,170 --> 01:08:45,170
I'm looking at your bulletin board
and there's a picture of you...

1119
01:08:45,240 --> 01:08:48,820
sitting next to a guy and I think
that that guy might be Curtis Booker.

1120
01:08:48,890 --> 01:08:50,710
He looks like he's got Bucky Beaver teeth.

1121
01:08:50,780 --> 01:08:52,980
He looks a lot older than 13!

1122
01:08:53,050 --> 01:08:55,990
So I don't know how you feel about it,
but it's gone!

1123
01:08:56,060 --> 01:08:58,160
Old Curtis Booker can go bye-bye!

1124
01:09:01,080 --> 01:09:03,020
Baby, do you have any Scotch Tape?

1125
01:09:03,100 --> 01:09:06,390
You're acting like I cheated on you,
and I've never cheated on you...

1126
01:09:06,460 --> 01:09:10,350
except for that one time with myself,
and you caught me.

1127
01:09:24,920 --> 01:09:25,900
Hello.

1128
01:09:25,980 --> 01:09:28,560
Darlene! How you doing?
This is Percy Jones.

1129
01:09:28,630 --> 01:09:32,490
I'm looking for Marilyn. She left a little
earlier. I thought she'd be back by now.

1130
01:09:32,570 --> 01:09:36,020
- I'm sorry. Now, who is this?
- Percy Jones.

1131
01:09:36,150 --> 01:09:38,900
I'm sorry, Percy.
I must have fell asleep on the couch.

1132
01:09:38,970 --> 01:09:41,070
Baby, you say you looking for Marilyn?

1133
01:09:41,140 --> 01:09:43,380
- Have you seen her?
- Well, now, what happened?

1134
01:09:43,450 --> 01:09:45,620
What'd you say to my sister, Percy Jones?

1135
01:09:46,930 --> 01:09:48,110
Nothing.

1136
01:09:48,340 --> 01:09:51,340
Listen, if you hear from her,
can you let me know?

1137
01:09:51,410 --> 01:09:55,510
Will do. And I look forward to seeing you
tomorrow at the party, right?

1138
01:09:55,580 --> 01:09:58,290
- Yeah, it should be a lot of fun.
- Goodbye.

1139
01:10:09,300 --> 01:10:10,380
Girl!

1140
01:10:11,570 --> 01:10:14,480
You will never guess
who was just on the phone!

1141
01:10:15,350 --> 01:10:17,930
- Who?
- A Mr. Percy A. Jones.

1142
01:10:18,390 --> 01:10:19,920
Percy A. Who?

1143
01:10:21,110 --> 01:10:23,980
Yeah, well, baby, he is feeling the pain now!

1144
01:10:25,490 --> 01:10:28,560
Mom. Is that gonna be your last one?

1145
01:10:28,630 --> 01:10:31,470
It might be, baby. And it might not.

1146
01:10:31,960 --> 01:10:34,860
You should be over there
trying to work this out with Dad.

1147
01:10:34,930 --> 01:10:38,160
I should be over there trying to work it out
with Simon. Mom, please.

1148
01:10:38,230 --> 01:10:42,060
Child, leave your mom alone.
They ain't going nowhere.

1149
01:10:42,130 --> 01:10:44,850
Your man quit his job and didn't tell you.

1150
01:10:45,170 --> 01:10:47,470
- Got to nip that shit in the bud.
- Yes.

1151
01:10:47,670 --> 01:10:50,060
No. But... Look, I have 15 missed calls.

1152
01:10:50,450 --> 01:10:53,770
- Fifteen, Mom. Fifteen!
- Fifteen?

1153
01:10:53,840 --> 01:10:55,880
Your baby got 15 missed calls!

1154
01:10:55,950 --> 01:10:58,090
- Bullshit. Let him wait!
- That's true.

1155
01:10:58,160 --> 01:10:59,440
I'm gonna call him now.

1156
01:10:59,500 --> 01:11:02,890
- No, you're not!
- No. Don't you dare!

1157
01:11:02,960 --> 01:11:05,580
Child, you take your finger off that trigger!

1158
01:11:05,650 --> 01:11:08,580
Did he lie to you, Theresa?
Did he lie to you?

1159
01:11:08,660 --> 01:11:09,970
Yes, he did.

1160
01:11:10,320 --> 01:11:14,120
So, if you don't want him to do it again,
let him feel the pain!

1161
01:11:15,020 --> 01:11:18,800
Look, honey, and if you want him
that bad, you've got to train him.

1162
01:11:20,270 --> 01:11:22,920
My God, if what he's giving you
is that good...

1163
01:11:22,990 --> 01:11:26,540
and then you still don't want him,
send his pasty ass to me!

1164
01:11:30,540 --> 01:11:32,810
- All right, one more!
- Two!

1165
01:11:32,880 --> 01:11:34,540
There you go, baby!

1166
01:11:39,980 --> 01:11:41,640
Here's to you, baby.

1167
01:11:44,690 --> 01:11:47,620
I gotta go to work in the morning. Hello?

1168
01:11:48,430 --> 01:11:51,210
- Sorry, Marcus.
- I'm sorry, baby.

1169
01:11:53,130 --> 01:11:54,660
You want a taste?

1170
01:12:03,690 --> 01:12:05,290
Thank you, Marcus.

1171
01:12:07,240 --> 01:12:08,810
This is my house.

1172
01:12:31,720 --> 01:12:35,300
- She won't answer the phone.
- She don't want to talk to you.

1173
01:12:36,330 --> 01:12:38,600
- Can I get something to drink?
- What, vodka?

1174
01:12:38,670 --> 01:12:42,210
Yes. Vodka. I would like some vodka.

1175
01:12:42,570 --> 01:12:44,390
Sorry, Charlie. No vodka.

1176
01:12:44,460 --> 01:12:48,200
There's gotta be something around here.
Marilyn was throwing an anniversary party.

1177
01:12:48,270 --> 01:12:49,310
Is throwing a party.

1178
01:12:49,390 --> 01:12:50,630
- Was.
- Is.

1179
01:12:50,950 --> 01:12:53,090
- Party's off, dude.
- The party is on, dude.

1180
01:12:53,160 --> 01:12:56,460
You won't find no liquor in here.
This is a Christian home.

1181
01:12:56,520 --> 01:12:57,600
Bingo.

1182
01:13:00,870 --> 01:13:02,180
With a house full of sinners.

1183
01:13:02,250 --> 01:13:05,250
Marilyn's got good taste in vodka.
This is, like, a $50 bottle.

1184
01:13:05,320 --> 01:13:07,330
Give me that. Give it here.

1185
01:13:10,760 --> 01:13:13,280
- Can I at least have a little bit?
- No.

1186
01:13:14,090 --> 01:13:15,490
Just a taste.

1187
01:13:17,320 --> 01:13:21,120
Come around here and get those
two glasses over there. Hurry up.

1188
01:13:24,230 --> 01:13:25,660
Who's playing?

1189
01:13:26,250 --> 01:13:28,610
Played. That's history.

1190
01:13:29,220 --> 01:13:31,460
New York Giants' first Super Bowl win.

1191
01:13:31,780 --> 01:13:33,920
Talking about Phil Simms. L.T.

1192
01:13:41,770 --> 01:13:43,200
You ever play?

1193
01:13:45,320 --> 01:13:48,190
- I told you before, no.
- Pitiful.

1194
01:13:57,220 --> 01:13:59,040
All right, let's do it.

1195
01:13:59,530 --> 01:14:00,700
Do what?

1196
01:14:10,050 --> 01:14:13,700
- Fumble!
- You said you weren't gonna hit me!

1197
01:14:13,760 --> 01:14:16,420
Touchdown! Yeah, baby.

1198
01:14:17,480 --> 01:14:19,650
- This is where your hands go.
- Where am I gonna be?

1199
01:14:19,720 --> 01:14:22,020
- You're on the bottom. I'm on the top.
- All right.

1200
01:14:22,080 --> 01:14:24,220
Okay, so you hold this frame.

1201
01:14:24,580 --> 01:14:27,230
One and step. Right.

1202
01:14:27,300 --> 01:14:28,670
- I'm leading.
- Okay.

1203
01:14:28,740 --> 01:14:30,300
Back. Nice. Step.

1204
01:14:30,760 --> 01:14:32,640
Left. Good. Double-time.

1205
01:14:35,200 --> 01:14:37,540
- Okay, no. See? This is...
- What was wrong with that?

1206
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:38,940
- You're screwing around.
- I'm not.

1207
01:14:39,010 --> 01:14:41,080
You're getting crazy here,
not holding your frame.

1208
01:14:41,160 --> 01:14:43,810
There must be space between us.
Not like when we're sleeping.

1209
01:14:43,870 --> 01:14:45,020
You can't be, like, up here.

1210
01:14:45,090 --> 01:14:48,120
You're not holding your frame.
It's a structured dance.

1211
01:14:48,420 --> 01:14:50,910
- Okay, so back up.
- Your mama taught you this?

1212
01:14:50,980 --> 01:14:53,790
Yes, I used to help her in the dance studio
on the weekends.

1213
01:14:53,860 --> 01:14:55,960
- Step. Two.
- You get fired from there, too?

1214
01:14:56,030 --> 01:14:58,900
No. I didn't get fired from this job. I quit.

1215
01:15:00,190 --> 01:15:03,540
Was it over money? Because if it wasn't,
this doesn't make any sense.

1216
01:15:03,620 --> 01:15:06,400
I had a difference of opinion
with the management.

1217
01:15:06,470 --> 01:15:08,950
They weren't ready for a guy like me.

1218
01:15:11,070 --> 01:15:12,220
I don't get it.

1219
01:15:12,290 --> 01:15:14,260
And heads. No, you're doing great.

1220
01:15:14,340 --> 01:15:17,790
I ain't talking about this.
I'm talking about you and Theresa.

1221
01:15:17,860 --> 01:15:19,800
You ain't got nothing in common.

1222
01:15:20,390 --> 01:15:21,730
For example:

1223
01:15:23,170 --> 01:15:25,980
You don't like sports. Theresa loves sports.

1224
01:15:26,500 --> 01:15:29,020
You're a businessman. She's an artist.

1225
01:15:29,500 --> 01:15:32,600
You're white. She's black.
Did I miss anything?

1226
01:15:33,860 --> 01:15:37,020
No. That's just it. She's everything I'm not.

1227
01:15:38,180 --> 01:15:41,660
You know, she's my other half.
Without her, I'm not whole.

1228
01:15:42,970 --> 01:15:45,590
You know, the thing
about meeting your other half is...

1229
01:15:45,660 --> 01:15:48,050
you're walking around,
you think you're happy...

1230
01:15:48,130 --> 01:15:49,300
you think that you're whole.

1231
01:15:49,370 --> 01:15:52,060
Then you realize you ain't shit without her.

1232
01:15:52,130 --> 01:15:53,850
Then you can't go back to being a half...

1233
01:15:53,920 --> 01:15:56,090
'cause now you know what it's like
to be a whole.

1234
01:15:56,160 --> 01:15:57,880
You know what I mean?

1235
01:15:58,720 --> 01:16:00,030
Yeah, I do.

1236
01:16:03,230 --> 01:16:04,890
And I still got it.

1237
01:16:05,180 --> 01:16:06,520
- That was nice.
- Real nice.

1238
01:16:06,590 --> 01:16:08,410
- I liked the snap.
- You like that?

1239
01:16:08,480 --> 01:16:10,140
- I think you hurt me.
- Percy Jones, boy.

1240
01:16:14,170 --> 01:16:15,580
Good morning.

1241
01:16:16,730 --> 01:16:18,900
Looks like I missed a fun night.

1242
01:16:18,970 --> 01:16:23,130
- Just sitting up here, watching football.
- That's how it always starts.

1243
01:16:23,930 --> 01:16:27,480
- Where's Marilyn?
- She stayed all night at Darlene's house.

1244
01:16:27,680 --> 01:16:29,330
She must be really mad.

1245
01:16:29,400 --> 01:16:31,920
Wait. You knew where they were
the whole time?

1246
01:16:32,030 --> 01:16:33,690
Yeah. I thought they'd be back by now.

1247
01:16:33,750 --> 01:16:35,830
- Did you apologize?
- I didn't do anything.

1248
01:16:35,900 --> 01:16:37,210
Exactly!

1249
01:16:37,530 --> 01:16:41,750
Dante, please. Don't try to play
that metrosexual mind game on me, okay?

1250
01:16:42,040 --> 01:16:43,730
Okay. All right.

1251
01:16:46,240 --> 01:16:47,830
Let's go get them.

1252
01:16:49,050 --> 01:16:50,770
You don't understand.

1253
01:16:51,510 --> 01:16:55,260
They done called all their friends
and sat up all night ragging on men.

1254
01:16:55,320 --> 01:16:58,620
They've worked themselves up
into a man-hating frenzy.

1255
01:16:59,540 --> 01:17:02,580
- How many women?
- I guarantee you, large numbers.

1256
01:17:02,650 --> 01:17:03,830
Sisters.

1257
01:17:04,150 --> 01:17:08,110
You can't just walk in on a bunch
of angry black women. You'll die.

1258
01:17:08,920 --> 01:17:11,600
Well, we'll just have to go out like men.

1259
01:17:12,760 --> 01:17:15,250
- He's right, Percy.
- I know he's right.

1260
01:17:15,320 --> 01:17:17,050
But I'm still scared.

1261
01:17:17,340 --> 01:17:19,890
- Keep talking. What are you saying?
- Like that, a little.

1262
01:17:19,960 --> 01:17:21,750
- I'm liking it.
- Thank you.

1263
01:17:21,820 --> 01:17:23,850
You gonna share your colors?

1264
01:17:24,220 --> 01:17:26,320
You're one of them sisters
who don't share colors.

1265
01:17:26,390 --> 01:17:27,370
No, I'm not.

1266
01:17:27,450 --> 01:17:28,760
Give up your secrets, honey.

1267
01:17:28,820 --> 01:17:32,050
This is gorgeous. Pink Passion.
Every woman needs this.

1268
01:17:32,120 --> 01:17:33,400
A little Pink Passion?

1269
01:17:33,460 --> 01:17:34,670
You know what I always say?

1270
01:17:34,740 --> 01:17:38,360
A little bit of makeup, a little bit of hair
ain't never hurt nobody.

1271
01:17:38,460 --> 01:17:40,940
How did I know
she would be wearing Pink Passion?

1272
01:17:46,550 --> 01:17:48,720
- Yes, they're in there.
- Maybe I should go first.

1273
01:17:48,790 --> 01:17:52,170
Are you crazy? I'm the one
that got experience in this sort of thing.

1274
01:17:52,250 --> 01:17:54,800
You just pay attention.
I'll show you how it's done.

1275
01:17:54,870 --> 01:17:56,760
Here, straighten yourself up.

1276
01:17:56,820 --> 01:17:59,210
If you go up in there,
you go in looking like a man.

1277
01:17:59,290 --> 01:18:01,260
- Wipe this off.
- You got something.

1278
01:18:01,330 --> 01:18:02,860
Thank you. Yeah.

1279
01:18:04,470 --> 01:18:07,730
- Man, I'm not gonna...
- No. We gotta do this.

1280
01:18:14,870 --> 01:18:16,620
Well, well, well.

1281
01:18:16,690 --> 01:18:19,340
- Lf it isn't Mr. Percy Jones.
- It is I.

1282
01:18:19,410 --> 01:18:21,010
It's about time you showed up.

1283
01:18:21,080 --> 01:18:22,800
- What's up?
- I'm well.

1284
01:18:26,160 --> 01:18:27,890
- Percy.
- Marilyn.

1285
01:18:29,620 --> 01:18:32,620
Marilyn, may I speak to you in private
over there, please...

1286
01:18:32,690 --> 01:18:34,480
so the ladies can continue eating?

1287
01:18:34,550 --> 01:18:36,370
Oh, no! You go on home with that.

1288
01:18:36,430 --> 01:18:39,780
- It's not going down like that, my brother.
- No way, no how.

1289
01:18:39,860 --> 01:18:43,570
You know better than that, Percy.
You got something to say, say it here.

1290
01:18:43,630 --> 01:18:45,130
In front of everybody.

1291
01:18:45,200 --> 01:18:47,920
Step up to the chalk line and be a man.

1292
01:18:51,760 --> 01:18:54,410
I married you, didn't I?
Don't that count for something?

1293
01:18:54,480 --> 01:18:56,390
- Hell, no!
- What does he want, an award?

1294
01:18:56,470 --> 01:18:57,840
That don't count for nothing!

1295
01:18:57,900 --> 01:18:59,310
It really doesn't count.

1296
01:18:59,380 --> 01:19:01,870
- Come on, man.
- I know, I'm just...

1297
01:19:07,860 --> 01:19:09,100
Oh, hell.

1298
01:19:09,170 --> 01:19:10,600
I was wrong, okay?

1299
01:19:10,670 --> 01:19:12,750
- It's a good start, Percy.
- Keep going!

1300
01:19:12,820 --> 01:19:15,050
I've been wrong for a long time.

1301
01:19:15,670 --> 01:19:17,450
Ever since I forgot...

1302
01:19:19,020 --> 01:19:20,910
that you are my better half.

1303
01:19:21,300 --> 01:19:24,010
Hell, Marilyn, you're everything I'm not.

1304
01:19:25,520 --> 01:19:27,530
Without you, I'm not whole.

1305
01:19:29,170 --> 01:19:30,570
Look. Let...

1306
01:19:36,170 --> 01:19:38,790
Baby, before I met you,
I thought I was all that.

1307
01:19:38,860 --> 01:19:42,950
And then you came into my life,
and I realized that I wasn't all that.

1308
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:47,910
Wasn't even half of that.

1309
01:19:48,660 --> 01:19:50,440
I might have been a quarter of that.

1310
01:19:50,510 --> 01:19:52,140
But then you left me last night!

1311
01:19:52,210 --> 01:19:55,240
And, baby, I remembered
how it felt to be without you.

1312
01:19:55,310 --> 01:19:58,690
And let me tell you something.
I ain't shit without you!

1313
01:19:59,090 --> 01:20:00,160
- Dad.
- Man.

1314
01:20:00,240 --> 01:20:02,130
And I forgot about that.

1315
01:20:03,250 --> 01:20:04,670
And I'm sorry.

1316
01:20:10,220 --> 01:20:11,710
Baby, marry me.

1317
01:20:12,880 --> 01:20:14,600
Make me whole again.

1318
01:20:14,670 --> 01:20:17,120
- I love you, Percy.
- I love you, too.

1319
01:20:18,120 --> 01:20:21,060
- That's what I'm talking about, baby.
- You go, Marilyn, bad girl!

1320
01:20:21,130 --> 01:20:22,590
Kiss your baby.

1321
01:20:22,670 --> 01:20:24,840
- I missed you so much.
- I missed you.

1322
01:20:24,910 --> 01:20:28,070
I couldn't sleep at all last night.
I'm sorry, baby.

1323
01:20:28,940 --> 01:20:30,730
I feel so much better!

1324
01:20:30,830 --> 01:20:33,130
- Isn't that lovely?
- Get off that.

1325
01:20:42,280 --> 01:20:44,010
I guess it's my turn.

1326
01:20:45,800 --> 01:20:47,080
All right.

1327
01:20:48,430 --> 01:20:51,660
That's going to be a tough speech to follow.

1328
01:20:52,430 --> 01:20:54,790
- It was a great speech, Perce.
- Thank you.

1329
01:20:54,860 --> 01:20:58,880
- I had something similar in mind.
- Great minds think alike.

1330
01:20:58,950 --> 01:21:01,320
Admitting you were wrong
would be a great start.

1331
01:21:01,390 --> 01:21:02,850
Yes, it would.

1332
01:21:04,330 --> 01:21:05,440
Right.

1333
01:21:07,660 --> 01:21:09,090
Go ahead, man.

1334
01:21:10,540 --> 01:21:12,130
Baby, I was wrong!

1335
01:21:13,450 --> 01:21:15,110
What are you doing?

1336
01:21:17,320 --> 01:21:20,450
I want to see your sexy body
go bump, bump, bump.

1337
01:21:20,680 --> 01:21:22,690
We have to talk in private.

1338
01:21:23,240 --> 01:21:25,440
I don't wanna hear it. No. Mom?

1339
01:21:27,110 --> 01:21:29,480
Just stay here and talk about it
in front of everybody!

1340
01:21:29,540 --> 01:21:31,010
Ladies, please.

1341
01:21:31,620 --> 01:21:34,110
Take your man
and go work out your business.

1342
01:21:34,180 --> 01:21:35,590
That's right.

1343
01:21:36,460 --> 01:21:37,600
Go on.

1344
01:21:38,760 --> 01:21:39,870
Thank you.

1345
01:21:39,940 --> 01:21:42,180
- Don't let him work on you.
- That ain't right.

1346
01:21:42,250 --> 01:21:44,960
- Did he say "bump, bump, bump"?
- Yeah, and it's Percy's fault.

1347
01:21:45,030 --> 01:21:46,270
It's all your fault!

1348
01:21:46,340 --> 01:21:49,950
Those kids are in love and they finally
liked each other and you all interfere.

1349
01:21:50,020 --> 01:21:54,720
My love right here.
Don't tell me how to define my love!

1350
01:21:54,950 --> 01:21:56,510
Lord have mercy.

1351
01:22:01,510 --> 01:22:02,560
Baby.

1352
01:22:03,530 --> 01:22:04,700
Come on.

1353
01:22:08,420 --> 01:22:10,430
I was trying to impress your father.

1354
01:22:10,500 --> 01:22:13,500
I didn't want to show up here
and be the unemployed fiancÃ©.

1355
01:22:13,570 --> 01:22:17,250
I've never lied to you before
and I'll never lie to you again, ever.

1356
01:22:17,320 --> 01:22:20,100
You lied about asking my father for a loan.

1357
01:22:20,160 --> 01:22:23,360
That was an omission that was tied
to a previous lie. That doesn't...

1358
01:22:23,430 --> 01:22:25,150
And I look like an idiot to you.

1359
01:22:25,220 --> 01:22:29,110
No. You look a little bit
like Percy Jones, though.

1360
01:22:30,760 --> 01:22:32,510
I can't believe you're trying to be funny.

1361
01:22:32,580 --> 01:22:35,650
- Baby, come on.
- Why do you have to be funny right now?

1362
01:22:35,720 --> 01:22:37,180
Don't touch me!

1363
01:22:38,850 --> 01:22:40,060
You need to calm down.

1364
01:22:40,130 --> 01:22:43,300
You made me look like an asshole in there.
Don't tell me to calm down.

1365
01:22:43,360 --> 01:22:45,880
I think you were doing
a pretty good job of that yourself.

1366
01:22:45,950 --> 01:22:47,930
Not telling them about me?

1367
01:22:48,190 --> 01:22:51,160
And then I pitched in and I blew it, okay?

1368
01:22:51,230 --> 01:22:53,890
I panicked when I found out
that Nathan was blackballing me.

1369
01:22:53,950 --> 01:22:57,750
I thought if I could score this IPO, I'd have
enough money until I got another job.

1370
01:22:57,830 --> 01:23:01,140
- But I was doing that for you.
- What am I, your mother?

1371
01:23:01,220 --> 01:23:02,780
I don't need you to take care of me.

1372
01:23:02,850 --> 01:23:05,600
I want you to do things with me,
not for me, Simon!

1373
01:23:05,660 --> 01:23:07,870
- Will you just talk to me?
- I am talking to you.

1374
01:23:08,060 --> 01:23:10,650
- You're talking at me.
- I am talking to you.

1375
01:23:10,720 --> 01:23:14,230
But you need to talk to me and tell me
how am I supposed to believe in you...

1376
01:23:14,310 --> 01:23:16,510
when you don't trust me enough
to tell me the truth?

1377
01:23:16,580 --> 01:23:20,830
How do we get past this, with this skin,
if we don't have each other's back?

1378
01:23:20,900 --> 01:23:24,570
- Okay, I'm always gonna be the white boy.
- And I'll always be the black girl.

1379
01:23:24,640 --> 01:23:28,220
But at least I'm here and willing to deal
with it, and I don't know about you.

1380
01:23:28,290 --> 01:23:32,000
I don't know. And eventually, if you're
gonna quit on me, just do it and don't...

1381
01:23:32,060 --> 01:23:34,300
I'm standing right here!

1382
01:23:34,370 --> 01:23:37,470
What more do you want from me?
What do you want from the white boy?

1383
01:23:37,540 --> 01:23:39,800
I've been here busting my ass
to make you happy!

1384
01:23:39,870 --> 01:23:43,100
Then let me make this easy for you!
The engagement is off!

1385
01:23:43,260 --> 01:23:44,310
Fine.

1386
01:23:44,700 --> 01:23:46,080
- Good.
- Great.

1387
01:23:49,150 --> 01:23:50,260
Great.

1388
01:24:07,290 --> 01:24:09,050
I'm in Jersey!

1389
01:24:13,050 --> 01:24:15,800
- Okay, stand still now.
- I'm still.

1390
01:24:18,460 --> 01:24:19,890
You all right?

1391
01:24:22,170 --> 01:24:23,380
I'm fine.

1392
01:24:24,920 --> 01:24:27,790
I'm great. It's going to be a great day, Dad.

1393
01:24:27,870 --> 01:24:31,000
- It sure is.
- Yes. I'm gonna take lots of pictures.

1394
01:24:31,740 --> 01:24:34,590
- So you better smile big for me, okay?
- I will.

1395
01:24:34,650 --> 01:24:37,880
And no crying.
Mom said you cried last time.

1396
01:24:38,010 --> 01:24:40,430
I was not crying, I was sweating...

1397
01:24:40,670 --> 01:24:41,780
from my eyeballs.

1398
01:24:42,870 --> 01:24:45,660
Hell, I was nervous.
I knew I was making a big mistake.

1399
01:24:45,720 --> 01:24:47,320
A 25-year mistake.

1400
01:24:48,160 --> 01:24:49,940
And going for 25 more.

1401
01:24:52,570 --> 01:24:53,880
Sweetheart?

1402
01:24:54,390 --> 01:24:56,300
Why don't you call that man?

1403
01:24:56,380 --> 01:24:58,770
You know he got his cell phone on.
You know he does.

1404
01:24:58,840 --> 01:25:01,110
He's probably waiting on the 5:15 train.

1405
01:25:01,270 --> 01:25:04,020
We got a party going on.
You get his ass back here!

1406
01:25:04,090 --> 01:25:05,840
How many missed calls you have last night?

1407
01:25:05,910 --> 01:25:07,060
Thirty-three.

1408
01:25:07,130 --> 01:25:09,230
- Thirty-three?
- Yeah.

1409
01:25:09,560 --> 01:25:11,500
- Thirty-three?
- Yeah.

1410
01:25:11,710 --> 01:25:15,220
Thirty-three missed calls?
Sweetheart, that's major.

1411
01:25:15,930 --> 01:25:19,990
And you know the man is unemployed, yes,
but he calls you. So give him that.

1412
01:25:20,380 --> 01:25:23,690
Thirty-three missed calls?
And you can't call him once?

1413
01:25:24,890 --> 01:25:27,190
- Girl, don't be so proud.
- No. Daddy, it's not...

1414
01:25:27,260 --> 01:25:30,290
Pride ain't nothing
when it comes to matters of the heart.

1415
01:25:30,360 --> 01:25:31,790
It's not that.

1416
01:25:32,600 --> 01:25:34,670
- It's not?
- No.

1417
01:25:45,240 --> 01:25:48,850
- I was going to marry him.
- What?

1418
01:25:49,650 --> 01:25:52,950
We were going to announce
our engagement this weekend.

1419
01:26:01,430 --> 01:26:02,770
So, you see?

1420
01:26:03,350 --> 01:26:04,690
I have you to thank...

1421
01:26:04,760 --> 01:26:08,300
because you saved me from a big heartache.

1422
01:26:10,420 --> 01:26:13,140
Sweetheart, I just don't
understand something.

1423
01:26:13,200 --> 01:26:16,400
- Why did Simon quit his job?
- I don't know. He didn't say.

1424
01:26:16,790 --> 01:26:20,500
Why would a man quit his job on the day
he's gonna meet his future father-in-law?

1425
01:26:20,560 --> 01:26:24,590
Maybe he got tired of waiting
for that promotion that never happened.

1426
01:26:25,880 --> 01:26:27,880
Simon's a rising star, Dad.

1427
01:26:29,270 --> 01:26:31,500
- He really is.
- I believe that.

1428
01:26:32,050 --> 01:26:34,900
But that boss of his is just not a nice man.

1429
01:26:35,380 --> 01:26:37,870
- You ever met him?
- A couple of times.

1430
01:26:38,420 --> 01:26:41,170
He was always friendly, kind of.

1431
01:26:41,940 --> 01:26:45,580
But he always had
this look in his eyes, you know?

1432
01:26:46,960 --> 01:26:48,650
Just not a nice man.

1433
01:26:49,520 --> 01:26:51,820
But he was Simon's mentor, so...

1434
01:26:52,980 --> 01:26:54,190
Whatever.

1435
01:26:55,120 --> 01:26:56,400
Let it go.

1436
01:26:57,330 --> 01:26:59,340
Today is about you and Mom.

1437
01:27:01,910 --> 01:27:04,110
Now, first picture of the night.

1438
01:27:04,180 --> 01:27:06,630
- Let me get my... On my good side.
- Smile.

1439
01:27:08,720 --> 01:27:11,210
I don't want Mom to see me like this.

1440
01:27:13,300 --> 01:27:16,110
- I love you, Dad.
- I love you, too.

1441
01:27:40,140 --> 01:27:41,190
Damn!

1442
01:27:48,080 --> 01:27:49,290
No.

1443
01:27:49,360 --> 01:27:51,180
Do not do this to me, Percy Jones!

1444
01:27:51,250 --> 01:27:55,170
We have a schedule! Tick-tock.
Everything works. Timing.

1445
01:27:55,250 --> 01:27:56,360
I'll be right back.

1446
01:27:56,430 --> 01:27:58,280
- Timing!
- I'll be right back.

1447
01:27:58,380 --> 01:28:00,010
- In 10 minutes?
- Or so, okay?

1448
01:28:00,080 --> 01:28:01,220
How so?

1449
01:28:02,890 --> 01:28:05,760
I'm sorry.
Percy, have you met my wife, Diane?

1450
01:28:06,220 --> 01:28:08,770
I certainly have heard
a lot about you, Percy Jones.

1451
01:28:08,850 --> 01:28:10,310
Nice to meet you.

1452
01:28:10,380 --> 01:28:13,200
- Does Marilyn know you're going AWOL?
- Of course.

1453
01:28:14,280 --> 01:28:16,110
She does not.

1454
01:29:27,530 --> 01:29:29,670
So you missed your train, huh?

1455
01:29:31,980 --> 01:29:35,040
- There's another one at 6:00.
- You gonna be on it?

1456
01:29:35,530 --> 01:29:37,730
I should have been on that one.

1457
01:29:41,350 --> 01:29:43,240
What are you doing here?

1458
01:29:43,530 --> 01:29:45,630
I know why you quit your job.

1459
01:29:46,090 --> 01:29:48,770
You told your boss you was coming here
to meet me and he said:

1460
01:29:48,840 --> 01:29:50,980
"Don't marry that black girl."

1461
01:29:53,800 --> 01:29:56,040
Those weren't exactly the words.

1462
01:29:59,050 --> 01:30:01,630
How did you know we were getting married?

1463
01:30:01,730 --> 01:30:04,900
I told you, son.
Don't nothing get past Percy Jones.

1464
01:30:05,090 --> 01:30:07,200
- Theresa told you.
- That, too.

1465
01:30:10,120 --> 01:30:11,840
Come on, man. Let's get real.

1466
01:30:11,910 --> 01:30:15,230
What you did with your boss
was honorable, impressive...

1467
01:30:16,130 --> 01:30:17,410
and stupid.

1468
01:30:17,480 --> 01:30:21,090
You can't quit your job every time
somebody rolls their eyes at the two of you.

1469
01:30:21,160 --> 01:30:23,200
You'll never make any money.

1470
01:30:30,560 --> 01:30:33,880
- How do you do 25 years?
- Painfully.

1471
01:30:36,800 --> 01:30:38,230
No, seriously.

1472
01:30:38,470 --> 01:30:42,050
If you're gonna marry one of these women,
sometimes it's gonna hurt like hell.

1473
01:30:42,120 --> 01:30:46,520
All you can do is admit that you're wrong
and know that she's always right.

1474
01:30:47,080 --> 01:30:48,570
- She's right?
- That's right.

1475
01:30:48,640 --> 01:30:49,890
- Always?
- Right.

1476
01:30:49,950 --> 01:30:51,160
- Right.
- That's right.

1477
01:30:51,230 --> 01:30:52,510
All right.

1478
01:30:53,060 --> 01:30:55,390
Okay, what about all the talk
about my dignity?

1479
01:30:55,460 --> 01:30:57,980
Do you love her? Do you want her?

1480
01:30:58,820 --> 01:31:00,710
Then she's always right.

1481
01:31:07,460 --> 01:31:10,270
Look, I know I didn't give you a fair shake.

1482
01:31:10,820 --> 01:31:12,340
And I was wrong.

1483
01:31:14,150 --> 01:31:16,930
And my daughter,
she'd be lucky to have you.

1484
01:31:24,610 --> 01:31:26,710
I'm not a quitter, Mr. Jones.

1485
01:31:27,650 --> 01:31:29,790
I think I know that about you.

1486
01:31:30,430 --> 01:31:31,960
Theresa doesn't.

1487
01:31:33,410 --> 01:31:36,280
You just have to show her
what you're made of.

1488
01:31:36,450 --> 01:31:39,640
You know she's hot-headed.
She's just like her mama.

1489
01:31:43,460 --> 01:31:46,210
Every man gets to choose his destiny, son.

1490
01:31:47,840 --> 01:31:49,980
No matter what his father did.

1491
01:32:06,910 --> 01:32:09,150
And, Percy, you are not perfect.

1492
01:32:09,370 --> 01:32:12,630
But that works for me because
two perfect people in one relationship...

1493
01:32:12,700 --> 01:32:14,290
might be too much.

1494
01:32:15,840 --> 01:32:18,170
And sometimes you bark
and bluff and bluster...

1495
01:32:18,240 --> 01:32:21,240
but I always see the boy I married
25 years ago.

1496
01:32:21,310 --> 01:32:25,300
And I only wish I loved him
as much as I did back then, but I don't.

1497
01:32:30,490 --> 01:32:32,020
I love him more.

1498
01:32:32,160 --> 01:32:34,260
Thank you, Marilyn. That was lovely.

1499
01:32:34,460 --> 01:32:36,430
Percy? Your vows?

1500
01:32:41,850 --> 01:32:43,280
Marilyn Jones.

1501
01:32:43,960 --> 01:32:46,480
Everyone knows I didn't write my vows.

1502
01:32:48,060 --> 01:32:51,060
Everyone knows because you kept
beating me up about it for weeks...

1503
01:32:51,130 --> 01:32:54,000
crying to all your friends. You know?

1504
01:32:54,620 --> 01:32:56,950
Now, look here, woman. I love you.

1505
01:32:58,170 --> 01:33:00,920
But you didn't have to do me like that
about my vows.

1506
01:33:00,990 --> 01:33:03,850
You know I don't like writing.
She knows that.

1507
01:33:05,430 --> 01:33:07,120
I'm not a wordsmith.

1508
01:33:07,830 --> 01:33:10,740
I do numbers. That's me. I don't do words.

1509
01:33:11,480 --> 01:33:13,170
Damn it, I do money.

1510
01:33:14,230 --> 01:33:17,880
And after 25 years, all I've asked you...

1511
01:33:19,700 --> 01:33:21,360
is to let me be me.

1512
01:33:25,750 --> 01:33:27,990
You'll never find

1513
01:33:29,560 --> 01:33:31,600
As long as you shall live

1514
01:33:32,020 --> 01:33:33,300
Oh, Lord.

1515
01:33:33,530 --> 01:33:35,280
Someone to love you

1516
01:33:35,350 --> 01:33:37,080
Love you, love you

1517
01:33:37,140 --> 01:33:39,220
Tender like I do

1518
01:33:39,290 --> 01:33:40,660
Tender like I do

1519
01:33:40,730 --> 01:33:42,390
You know that about me, woman.

1520
01:33:42,490 --> 01:33:44,720
You'll never find

1521
01:33:46,330 --> 01:33:48,370
No matter where you search

1522
01:33:48,440 --> 01:33:49,710
I'm not looking.

1523
01:33:49,850 --> 01:33:51,730
Someone to care about you

1524
01:33:51,800 --> 01:33:53,290
Care about you, care about you

1525
01:33:53,370 --> 01:33:56,880
The way I do

1526
01:33:58,550 --> 01:34:01,750
Oh, I'm not bragging on myself, baby

1527
01:34:02,550 --> 01:34:06,580
But I'm the only one that loves you

1528
01:34:08,890 --> 01:34:12,370
I think I forgot what love is
until you and Simon showed up.

1529
01:34:12,440 --> 01:34:15,020
Give that man another chance, daughter.

1530
01:34:15,570 --> 01:34:17,810
You'll never find

1531
01:34:20,180 --> 01:34:21,330
Simon!

1532
01:34:21,400 --> 01:34:22,920
Yes, Simon.

1533
01:34:23,570 --> 01:34:26,440
It'll take the end of all time

1534
01:34:27,220 --> 01:34:30,090
Someone who understands you

1535
01:34:31,350 --> 01:34:33,970
Like I do

1536
01:34:35,890 --> 01:34:37,450
That's not Jamal.

1537
01:34:43,480 --> 01:34:47,850
I could probably find a million reasons
why we shouldn't be together.

1538
01:34:48,310 --> 01:34:50,790
But you know what? I don't care.

1539
01:34:52,790 --> 01:34:54,510
I don't care, either.

1540
01:34:55,150 --> 01:34:56,500
I love you.

1541
01:34:56,790 --> 01:34:59,090
And I'm sorry that I lied to you.

1542
01:34:59,150 --> 01:35:00,460
I'm sorry, too.

1543
01:35:02,860 --> 01:35:04,270
You're sorry?

1544
01:35:05,840 --> 01:35:08,460
- Can you say that again?
- I'm sorry, Simon.

1545
01:35:08,530 --> 01:35:11,110
You're sorry? She said she was sorry.
I believe she's...

1546
01:35:11,180 --> 01:35:12,780
I'm sorry, Simon.

1547
01:35:14,610 --> 01:35:17,190
- Get your man, girl!
- Go ahead, sweetie!

1548
01:35:22,450 --> 01:35:24,650
Ladies and gentlemen,
it gives me great pleasure...

1549
01:35:24,720 --> 01:35:28,710
to introduce to you all
my future son-in-law, Simon Green.

1550
01:35:29,170 --> 01:35:32,400
He's broke, unemployed, and he's white.

1551
01:35:33,260 --> 01:35:36,010
But he loves my Theresa
and that's all right with us.

1552
01:35:36,080 --> 01:35:37,030
That's right.

1553
01:35:37,460 --> 01:35:40,520
Welcome to the family, son.
Welcome to the family.

1554
01:35:44,530 --> 01:35:46,150
And cue the magic.

1555
01:35:53,390 --> 01:35:54,440
Look at this.

1556
01:35:54,510 --> 01:35:56,520
Will you look at that shit?

1557
01:35:57,260 --> 01:35:59,430
Drink up! Enjoy!

1558
01:36:01,800 --> 01:36:03,210
Welcome, man.

1559
01:36:20,110 --> 01:36:22,180
- Let's watch the tango.
- No, let's watch the party.

1560
01:36:24,080 --> 01:36:27,300
- All right. Get your feet off the table.
- Sorry, sir.

1561
01:36:32,230 --> 01:36:35,530
- I look pretty good out there.
- You do, Mom.

1562
01:36:35,600 --> 01:36:39,300
Baby, you look so good
because you're twirling around me.

1563
01:36:39,370 --> 01:36:41,670
Oh, yeah, there you go, there you go.

1564
01:36:43,210 --> 01:36:44,770
All right, you blew that part.

1565
01:36:44,840 --> 01:36:47,110
- That was perfect.
- There was hesitation there.

1566
01:36:47,180 --> 01:36:49,550
- You did it better the night before.
- The night before?

1567
01:36:49,610 --> 01:36:52,390
- What happened?
- We had a little dry run the night before.

1568
01:36:52,460 --> 01:36:54,280
- Really?
- You didn't tell me that, Percy!

1569
01:36:54,350 --> 01:36:57,610
You're hallucinating, Simon.
I ain't never danced with no man in my life.

1570
01:36:57,670 --> 01:36:58,880
Taught him everything he knows.

1571
01:36:58,950 --> 01:37:01,120
Percy Jones was born
knowing how to tango.

1572
01:37:01,190 --> 01:37:03,460
And let me tell you something
about the tango.

1573
01:37:03,530 --> 01:37:06,280
- It's a structured dance.
- I told you that.

1574
01:37:11,210 --> 01:37:12,450
What was that, Mom?

1575
01:37:12,520 --> 01:37:15,750
You know what that is, Theresa.
You're a grown-ass woman.

1576
01:37:16,260 --> 01:37:18,910
- Damn, Mama, you still got it.
- I know it, Keisha.

1577
01:37:18,980 --> 01:37:21,370
All right now, watch this.
This is when I got funky.

1578
01:37:21,450 --> 01:37:25,640
- Go, Percy! It's your birthday!
- Go, Percy.

1579
01:37:27,500 --> 01:37:28,670
- Let's watch the vows.
- No!

1580
01:37:28,740 --> 01:37:31,680
- Watch the party.
- Okay, fine, whatever.

1581
01:37:34,090 --> 01:37:36,640
- There you are.
- I got her, that girl is mine!

1582
01:37:36,710 --> 01:37:39,400
I was just shocked you didn't fall down.

1583
01:37:39,460 --> 01:37:40,580
That is cold.

1584
01:37:40,650 --> 01:37:43,010
Look. Check me out. I am doing the hustle.

1585
01:37:43,080 --> 01:37:45,220
I'm doing the hustle in your honor,
Percy Jones.

1586
01:37:45,290 --> 01:37:47,840
That ain't no damn hustle.
That's the white man overbite.

1587
01:37:47,910 --> 01:37:50,910
- You ain't even doing that right.
- Why's it gotta be a white thing?

1588
01:37:50,980 --> 01:37:52,230
Blacks have overbites, too.

1589
01:37:52,290 --> 01:37:55,260
- He's doing a great hustle!
- He's turning it up.

1590
01:37:58,790 --> 01:38:00,990
- Why is my man looking at your ass?
- No, he's not.

1591
01:38:01,060 --> 01:38:02,850
Why is your man Samoan?

1592
01:38:02,920 --> 01:38:06,690
- Where is Manu these days?
- We broke up last week.

1593
01:38:06,760 --> 01:38:09,060
- Thank you, Jesus.
- What happened?

1594
01:38:09,130 --> 01:38:11,610
I only started going out with him
to mess with Daddy.

1595
01:38:11,680 --> 01:38:15,100
And, girl, please. He is too big.
He is a bone crusher.

1596
01:38:15,170 --> 01:38:16,860
- Watch your mouth!
- What?

1597
01:38:16,930 --> 01:38:19,520
Do not use the word "bone" in my house.

1598
01:38:29,920 --> 01:38:32,830
- Where were you all going?
- Let's see that again.

1599
01:38:32,900 --> 01:38:35,620
Your mother and I
got a sudden thirst for punch.

1600
01:38:35,780 --> 01:38:37,240
No. You're old enough to know.

1601
01:38:37,320 --> 01:38:39,840
We going to shake some sheets.
Is that all right with you?

1602
01:38:39,910 --> 01:38:42,530
I thought you said no bone in the house!

1603
01:38:42,950 --> 01:38:43,960
No!

1604
01:38:44,030 --> 01:38:46,970
If everyone wants to see the lift,
we do the lift.

1605
01:38:47,040 --> 01:38:48,470
We're doing the lift!

1606
01:38:48,550 --> 01:38:50,240
This is good.

1607
01:38:50,310 --> 01:38:53,150
No. I was so sure
you were going to drop me there.

1608
01:38:53,670 --> 01:38:54,750
I love you!

1609
01:38:54,820 --> 01:38:57,670
This is Dirty Dancing.
I've been doing this since high school.

1610
01:38:57,730 --> 01:38:58,780
Look at that.

1611
01:38:58,850 --> 01:39:01,340
- Who's the man?
- You did it with other girls?

1612
01:39:01,410 --> 01:39:04,670
No, I only do that with you.

1613
01:39:07,970 --> 01:39:09,430
I know that hurt.

1614
01:39:09,510 --> 01:39:12,700
See that move right there.
That's why you're not getting any grandkids.

1615
01:39:12,770 --> 01:39:16,570
Let me call your mama right now
and thank her for those dance lessons.

1616
01:39:16,640 --> 01:39:18,910
- That's a low blow.
- It's just a joke.

1617
01:39:19,200 --> 01:39:21,880
- Simon!
- Come on. I'll catch your big ass.

1618
01:39:26,020 --> 01:39:27,360
We're down!

1619
01:39:28,670 --> 01:39:30,840
Good thing is, she didn't break that dress.

1620
01:39:30,910 --> 01:39:33,660
No, she didn't,
but she felt bad about it all week.

1621
01:39:34,020 --> 01:39:35,670
They gotta go deep.

1622
01:39:35,780 --> 01:39:37,950
- I knew better.
- Oh, my God.

1623
01:39:38,010 --> 01:39:40,320
- That was a great party.
- It was, Mom.

1624
01:39:40,380 --> 01:39:43,480
Yeah, I guess a party not a party
till something get broke.

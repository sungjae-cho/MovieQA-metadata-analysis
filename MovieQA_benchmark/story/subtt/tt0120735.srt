1
00:00:43,861 --> 00:00:47,122
Right, let's sort the buyers from the spyers,
the needy from the greedy

2
00:00:47,218 --> 00:00:49,520
and those who trust me
from the ones who don't.

3
00:00:49,904 --> 00:00:51,823
Because if you can't see value here today,

4
00:00:52,014 --> 00:00:54,508
you're not up here shopping,
you're up here shoplifting.

5
00:00:54,892 --> 00:00:57,386
You see these goods?
You've never seen daylight, moonlight,

6
00:00:57,482 --> 00:00:59,688
Israelites,
Fanny by the gaslight.

7
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:02,854
Take a bag, come on, take a bag.
I took a bag home last night -

8
00:01:02,854 --> 00:01:04,772
it cost me a lot more than ten pound,
I can tell you.

9
00:01:05,156 --> 00:01:07,170
Anyone like jewellery?
Look at that one there.

10
00:01:07,362 --> 00:01:09,760
Hand-made in ltaly,
hand-stolen in Stepney.

11
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:12,446
It's as long as my arm,
I wish it was as long as something else.

12
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:15,324
Don't think 'cos these boxes
are sealed up, they're empty.

13
00:01:15,419 --> 00:01:17,626
The only man who sells empty
boxes is the undertaker.

14
00:01:17,722 --> 00:01:21,750
And by the look of some of you lot here today
I’d make more money with my measuring tape.

15
00:01:21,846 --> 00:01:23,477
Here, one price, ten pound.

16
00:01:23,573 --> 00:01:25,587
- Did you say ten pound?
- Are you deaf?

17
00:01:25,683 --> 00:01:26,930
That's a bargain. I'll take one.

18
00:01:27,122 --> 00:01:30,767
Squeeze in if you can. Left leg,
right leg, your body will follow.
They call it walking.

19
00:01:30,767 --> 00:01:34,124
Do you want one as well darlin’?
You do, that’s it, they're waking up.

20
00:01:34,124 --> 00:01:36,522
Treat the wife -
treat somebody else's wife.

21
00:01:36,618 --> 00:01:38,633
It's a lot more fun
if you don't get caught.

22
00:01:38,825 --> 00:01:41,606
Hold on, you want one as well?
OK, darlin', show me a bit of life, then.

23
00:01:41,798 --> 00:01:43,813
It's no good standing out there
like one o'clock half struck.

24
00:01:43,813 --> 00:01:46,498
My own you’d better buy'em,
these are not stolen -

25
00:01:46,594 --> 00:01:50,335
they just haven’t been paid for, and we
can’t get them again,
they’ve changed the bloody locks

26
00:01:50,335 --> 00:01:52,733
Here, one for you. No good coming back
later when I've sold out.
- Nice bit of stuff.

27
00:01:52,733 --> 00:01:54,172
- "Too late, too late "

28
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:57,242
will be the cry when the man with
the bargains has passed you by.

29
00:01:57,625 --> 00:01:59,064
If you've got no money on you now,

30
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,175
you'll crying tears as big
as October cabbages.

31
00:02:01,558 --> 00:02:02,997
Bacon, cozzers!

32
00:02:07,793 --> 00:02:11,630
# So I said I'm on the roam
So I need a car

33
00:02:11,822 --> 00:02:14,412
# And I know
that I'm getting alive

34
00:02:14,412 --> 00:02:17,481
# And I say I got faith
in a season ##

35
00:02:18,728 --> 00:02:20,359
'Ed can hustle
a few quid here and there.

36
00:02:20,455 --> 00:02:22,757
'But his real talent
lies in cards -

37
00:02:22,757 --> 00:02:25,059
'and gambling with cards.

38
00:02:28,321 --> 00:02:29,184
'Bacon could see that his days

39
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,925
'of selling moody goods
on street corners are numbered.'

40
00:02:32,925 --> 00:02:36,282
'It's time to move on
and he knows it.'

41
00:02:56,234 --> 00:02:58,344
What you talking about?
I'm bloody skinny, pal.

42
00:02:58,344 --> 00:03:00,167
Yeah, yeah, 'course you are. All right ?

43
00:03:00,263 --> 00:03:03,716
Nick the Greek, always a pleasure.
Tom, what have you been eatin'?
- I've been tellin' him...

44
00:03:03,812 --> 00:03:05,155
- Enough, already !

45
00:03:05,443 --> 00:03:07,169
You two, join me in my office.

46
00:03:11,102 --> 00:03:12,829
So how much is it then, Tom?

47
00:03:12,925 --> 00:03:14,267
You know how much is, Nick.

48
00:03:14,363 --> 00:03:16,857
- And that includes the amp, yeah?
- No.

49
00:03:16,953 --> 00:03:18,872
That does not include the amp.

50
00:03:20,215 --> 00:03:22,037
Shit, Tom. I thought
it included the amp.

51
00:03:22,133 --> 00:03:25,490
Well, it doesn't. I'll throw in one
of these telephones if you like,

52
00:03:25,586 --> 00:03:28,176
but it does not include the amp.

53
00:03:28,368 --> 00:03:30,095
Very nice.

54
00:03:30,958 --> 00:03:32,589
I hope it includes the speakers.

55
00:03:32,685 --> 00:03:35,370
It doesn't include the speakers
it doesn't include the amp.

56
00:03:35,466 --> 00:03:38,152
And it's not supposed to include me getting
the hump with your stupid questions.

57
00:03:38,248 --> 00:03:40,262
Now you want it, Nick, you buy it.

58
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:41,509
What else do I get with it?

59
00:03:41,605 --> 00:03:44,099
You get a gold-plated Rolls Royce,
as long as you pay for it.

60
00:03:44,963 --> 00:03:46,881
Don't know, Tom.
Seems expensive.

61
00:03:47,553 --> 00:03:51,006
Seems... well, this seems
to be a waste of my time.

62
00:03:51,102 --> 00:03:53,883
That is 900 nicker in any shop
you're lucky enough to find one in

63
00:03:54,075 --> 00:03:55,418
and you're complaining
about 200?

64
00:03:55,898 --> 00:03:57,624
What school of finance
did you study?

65
00:03:57,624 --> 00:03:59,159
It's a deal, it's a steal.

66
00:03:59,447 --> 00:04:01,078
It's the sale
of the fucking century.

67
00:04:01,941 --> 00:04:04,435
In fact, fucking, Nick, I think
I'll keep it.

68
00:04:04,819 --> 00:04:07,217
All right, all right, keep your alans on.

69
00:04:11,629 --> 00:04:12,492
Here's a ton.

70
00:04:12,684 --> 00:04:13,548
Jesus Christ!

71
00:04:13,835 --> 00:04:15,946
You could choke
a dozen donkeys on that,

72
00:04:16,137 --> 00:04:18,248
and you're haggling over 100 pound.

73
00:04:18,248 --> 00:04:19,974
What d'you do when you're
not buying stereos, Nick,

74
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:21,413
finance revolutions?

75
00:04:21,701 --> 00:04:23,811
£100 is still £100.

76
00:04:24,099 --> 00:04:26,209
Not when the price is £200, it's not.

77
00:04:26,497 --> 00:04:29,279
And certainly not when you've got
Liberia's deficit in your sky rocket.

78
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:31,389
Tighter than a duck's butt you are!

79
00:04:31,485 --> 00:04:35,226
Now come on, let me feel
the fibre of your fabric.

80
00:04:37,049 --> 00:04:38,296
'The skinny one is Tom.'

81
00:04:38,487 --> 00:04:40,598
'And he's the entrepreneur
of the bunch.'

82
00:04:40,885 --> 00:04:42,612
'He's got a couple of
dirty little fingers'

83
00:04:42,612 --> 00:04:44,339
'in a couple of dirty little pies.'

84
00:04:44,914 --> 00:04:47,024
'Nick, here, however,
has made it his business'

85
00:04:47,024 --> 00:04:49,710
'to have all 20 fat
little fingers and toes'

86
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:51,917
'in every dirty, bent
and stolen pie in London.'

87
00:04:52,204 --> 00:04:56,041
'Between the two of them, there ain't
much you can't get hold of.'

88
00:04:59,878 --> 00:05:01,509
That's my 25 grand.

89
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:05,154
It's all there, it took me a long time
to earn that, so you treat it with respect.

90
00:05:05,921 --> 00:05:07,456
What about the chef?

91
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:24,626
What've you come as?

92
00:05:25,202 --> 00:05:26,449
Cupid, stupid.

93
00:05:27,216 --> 00:05:29,710
That's the last time I'm getting anymore
fruit off of you, Tom.

94
00:05:29,806 --> 00:05:34,026
You call that fresh ? There was more small
hairy armoured things in your fruit than it was fruit.

95
00:05:34,602 --> 00:05:36,233
You should open a butchers,
not a grocers.

96
00:05:36,329 --> 00:05:38,055
Well if you will order stuff
from Kathmandu,

97
00:05:38,439 --> 00:05:40,837
don't be surprised if it picks up
a few tourists on route.

98
00:05:41,317 --> 00:05:43,235
Anyway, enough about that.
Where's the money?

99
00:05:43,523 --> 00:05:46,784
Oi! Keep your fingers
out of my soup!

100
00:05:47,456 --> 00:05:49,758
'Soap is called Soap

101
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:51,772
'because he likes to keep his hands
clean of any unlawful behaviour.'

102
00:05:51,964 --> 00:05:54,842
'He's proud of his job
and even more proud that it's legal.'

103
00:05:55,034 --> 00:05:57,623
'He represents the more
sensible side of the four.'

104
00:06:01,844 --> 00:06:03,667
Are you sure you can afford 25?

105
00:06:04,242 --> 00:06:05,681
It depends on
how you look at it.

106
00:06:06,065 --> 00:06:09,806
I can afford it as long as I see it again,
if that's what you mean.

107
00:06:09,038 --> 00:06:11,148
Got the rest from
the fat man and Bacon?

108
00:06:11,532 --> 00:06:12,875
Fat man, Bacon
and myself.

109
00:06:13,642 --> 00:06:15,945
Looks like it's time
to make that call to Harry.

110
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,959
Who's this fat man, then, ey ?

111
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:19,590
Ey ?

112
00:06:21,508 --> 00:06:23,522
D'you want a sandwich, Bacon?

113
00:06:25,921 --> 00:06:28,510
'It's not easy to take
a seat at this card table.'

114
00:06:28,702 --> 00:06:31,484
'The amount of money involved
has to be 100 grand upwards'

115
00:06:31,676 --> 00:06:33,786
'and there's no shortage
of punters.'

116
00:06:34,266 --> 00:06:36,952
'The man who decides whether
you can play or not is this man -'

117
00:06:37,143 --> 00:06:40,693
'Harry, or as some,
including himself like to call him,

118
00:06:40,884 --> 00:06:42,323
'Hatchet Harry.'

119
00:06:42,995 --> 00:06:44,242
You got it all?

120
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,599
100 grand.

121
00:06:47,695 --> 00:06:51,340
Well, If you got it, you got it.
Now, if you don't mind...

122
00:06:54,505 --> 00:06:59,110
- What's this Eddie like then?
- He's a fucking thief!

123
00:06:59,397 --> 00:07:01,604
'Harry has a colleague,
a monster of a man,'

124
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:02,947
'Barry the Baptist.'

125
00:07:03,138 --> 00:07:05,824
'The Baptist got his name
by drowning people for Hatchet.'

126
00:07:06,016 --> 00:07:08,798
- Are you ever gonna fucking pay ?
- Yeah, I'll pay !

127
00:07:08,222 --> 00:07:10,524
- Are you ever gonna fucking pay ?
- I'll pay, yeah! Yes, I'll pay !

128
00:07:10,141 --> 00:07:11,100
'Barry makes sure

129
00:07:11,196 --> 00:07:14,361
'the administrative side of the
business runs harmoniously.'

130
00:07:14,649 --> 00:07:16,568
The boy's got a rare ability.

131
00:07:16,664 --> 00:07:19,733
He seems to make cards
transparent. He's got...

132
00:07:19,925 --> 00:07:21,939
All right, all right,
so we can say he's good.

133
00:07:22,035 --> 00:07:26,160
Oh no, he's better than good.
He's a fucking liability.

134
00:07:26,352 --> 00:07:29,229
Yeah, hold on, what
do you think of these?

135
00:07:29,229 --> 00:07:32,011
- We're selling hundreds.
- Very nice, Harry.

136
00:07:33,066 --> 00:07:34,025
What's it for?

137
00:07:34,505 --> 00:07:37,766
Oh, don't play innocent with me,
Bazza. Spanking!

138
00:08:16,135 --> 00:08:18,342
There's 25 from me,
Tom, Soap and yourself.

139
00:08:18,821 --> 00:08:22,179
It's a 100 grand to the pound. So why the fuck
are you counting it?

140
00:08:22,946 --> 00:08:24,001
Because I like to.

141
00:08:24,193 --> 00:08:26,879
So a reasonable return should be
in the reason of 120 grand.

142
00:08:27,358 --> 00:08:30,524
As for 25 grand invested,
going on previous experience.

143
00:08:30,716 --> 00:08:31,963
Going on optimism.

144
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:34,744
Whatever it's going on - it should be enough
to send you on a cooking course.

145
00:08:35,991 --> 00:08:38,294
You're not funny, Tom.
You're fat -

146
00:08:38,581 --> 00:08:40,596
and look as though you
should be, but you're not.

147
00:08:40,692 --> 00:08:43,186
Fat! Who you calling...
Jesus!

148
00:08:43,569 --> 00:08:45,680
It's good in here, innit?
Handy for the tube,

149
00:08:45,871 --> 00:08:47,790
great electrics - I can
see why you moved in.

150
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:50,668
Don't knock it, it's "CHEEP",
like the budgie.

151
00:08:50,955 --> 00:08:53,929
And nobody wants to live next
to the people we live next to.

152
00:08:54,217 --> 00:08:56,903
- Anti-social to say the least.
- What d'you mean?

153
00:08:57,190 --> 00:08:59,205
He means they're
thieving bastards.

154
00:08:59,588 --> 00:09:02,178
I mean when they're not picking
peanuts out of poop,

155
00:09:02,466 --> 00:09:05,344
they rip off unfortunate souls
of their own earned drugs.

156
00:09:08,509 --> 00:09:11,483
Ssh. Not exactly thick,
these walls.

157
00:09:12,154 --> 00:09:14,840
Nice work, John.
Get yourself a drink.

158
00:09:20,308 --> 00:09:21,459
Is that it?

159
00:09:22,034 --> 00:09:23,569
How many times must
I tell you, Plank?

160
00:09:23,953 --> 00:09:27,022
You'll find a job worth doing, you'll
find your share improving.

161
00:09:27,502 --> 00:09:28,749
Have you got a problem
with that?

162
00:09:32,394 --> 00:09:38,821
# Police and thieves
in the street

163
00:09:39,492 --> 00:09:42,658
# Fighting the nation
with their... ##

164
00:09:44,864 --> 00:09:47,454
You know, Charles, this gear
is getting heavier.

165
00:09:49,372 --> 00:09:53,497
I've a strong suspicion we should've
been rocket scientists or...

166
00:09:54,072 --> 00:09:57,717
Nobel Peace Prize winners...
something....

167
00:09:58,005 --> 00:09:58,964
Peace Prize?

168
00:09:59,924 --> 00:10:03,952
Be lucky to find your penis for a piss
if you keep smoking.

169
00:10:08,844 --> 00:10:10,859
Who the hell's that?

170
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:19,875
All right, Willie?

171
00:10:20,835 --> 00:10:24,384
Does it look like I am all right ?
Take this.

172
00:10:25,631 --> 00:10:28,413
I'm in danger of breaking
sweat at any second.

173
00:10:28,892 --> 00:10:31,290
Charles,
why've we got that cage?

174
00:10:32,154 --> 00:10:34,168
Security.

175
00:10:34,648 --> 00:10:38,005
That's right.
That's right. Security.

176
00:10:38,676 --> 00:10:42,129
So what's the point in having it
if we're not gonna fucking use it?

177
00:10:42,417 --> 00:10:44,719
Well, I would've used it, Winston,
but this is Willie.

178
00:10:45,295 --> 00:10:47,405
- And Willie lives here.
- Yes, Charles.

179
00:10:47,597 --> 00:10:51,050
But you didn't know it was Willie
until you opened the door, did you?

180
00:10:51,434 --> 00:10:54,503
Chill, Winston. It's me.

181
00:10:54,695 --> 00:10:58,436
Charlie knows it's me,
what's the problem?

182
00:10:58,916 --> 00:11:01,314
The problem is, Willie,
that Charles and yourself

183
00:11:01,314 --> 00:11:03,616
are not the quickest of cats
at the best of times.

184
00:11:03,712 --> 00:11:09,180
So do as I say and keep
the fucking cage LOCKED!

185
00:11:09,947 --> 00:11:12,249
- What is that?
- That's Gloria.

186
00:11:12,249 --> 00:11:15,031
Yes, I know that's Gloria.
What's THAT?

187
00:11:16,086 --> 00:11:18,004
Err...fertiliser.

188
00:11:18,484 --> 00:11:21,266
You went out six hours ago
to buy a money counter.

189
00:11:21,362 --> 00:11:23,280
And you come back with
a semi-conscious Gloria

190
00:11:23,376 --> 00:11:25,486
and a bag of fertiliser ?

191
00:11:25,774 --> 00:11:27,884
Alarm bells are ringing, Willie.

192
00:11:28,268 --> 00:11:29,899
We need fertiliser, Winston.

193
00:11:29,995 --> 00:11:32,393
We also need a money counter.

194
00:11:32,777 --> 00:11:34,215
This money's gotta
be out by Thursday.

195
00:11:34,407 --> 00:11:36,230
I'm buggered
if I'm gonna count it.

196
00:11:36,901 --> 00:11:40,067
Oh, and, if you do have to buy
sodding fertiliser,

197
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:42,657
could you just be
a little more subtle?

198
00:11:43,424 --> 00:11:44,959
What do you mean?

199
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:49,179
We grow copious amounts
of ganja, yeah?

200
00:11:49,755 --> 00:11:51,002
Yeah.

201
00:11:51,481 --> 00:11:55,414
And you're carrying a wasted
girl and a bag of fertiliser.

202
00:11:56,182 --> 00:11:58,963
You don't look your average
horti-fucking-culturalist.

203
00:11:59,347 --> 00:12:00,498
That's what I mean, Willie.

204

# "The Boss" #

205
00:12:09,227 --> 00:12:13,352
# Paid the cost to be the boss

206
00:12:15,366 --> 00:12:18,148
# Paid the cost to be the boss

207
00:12:19,299 --> 00:12:22,656
# I paid the cost
to be the boss ##

208
00:12:24,671 --> 00:12:29,754
- How long's he been in there, son ?
- About...20 minutes.

209
00:12:30,522 --> 00:12:34,071
- Is he on his own?
- Yeah, just carrying a bag.

210
00:12:35,989 --> 00:12:38,963
Let's pay him a little visit then,
shall we?

211
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,622
'Big Chris settles debts
for Harry.'

212
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:47,884
'The only thing he cares
more about than an unsettled debts'

213
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:51,433
'is his son and heir,
Little Chris.'

214
00:12:52,296 --> 00:12:53,927
# Look at me

215
00:12:54,502 --> 00:12:55,845
# Know what you see

216
00:12:56,517 --> 00:12:57,764
# See a bad mother ##

217
00:13:06,493 --> 00:13:09,754
This is one of them...
high-powered jobs, innit?

218
00:13:10,809 --> 00:13:12,152
Aaagh!

219
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,263
I've got some bad news
for you, John.

220
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:15,893
What the fuck!

221
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:18,675
Mind your language
in front of the boy.

222
00:13:18,867 --> 00:13:20,881
Jesus Christ!

223
00:13:22,128 --> 00:13:24,814
That includes blasphemy as well.
Now tell me, John,

224
00:13:25,294 --> 00:13:28,747
how can you be concentratin'
on improving this lovely tan -

225
00:13:28,939 --> 00:13:30,377
and it is a lovely tan by the way-

226
00:13:30,569 --> 00:13:33,063
when you've got more pressing
priorities at hand?

227
00:13:33,351 --> 00:13:36,804
Tell Harry...l mean Mr Harry,

228
00:13:36,996 --> 00:13:39,874
I've been busy,
I'm nearly there.

229
00:13:40,066 --> 00:13:41,888
Check his locker, son.

230
00:13:41,984 --> 00:13:48,315
I don't suppose there's any chance of you
lifting this sunbeam up, Chris, isn't it ?

231
00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:54,262
He's not poor! He's got over a monkey,
and that's just in his wallet!

232
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:57,811
Fuckin' hell, John, you always walk round
with that in your pocket?

233
00:13:57,811 --> 00:14:01,169
Oi! Use language like that again, sun,
you'll wish you hadn't!

234
00:14:01,456 --> 00:14:02,703
Sorry, Dad.

235
00:14:02,703 --> 00:14:04,718
Right. Put the rest
of the stuff in that.

236
00:14:06,061 --> 00:14:08,555
You can go home
in a plastic bag tonight, John.

237
00:14:08,651 --> 00:14:10,185
You owe what you owe.

238
00:14:10,185 --> 00:14:13,926
And by the time this tan's faded
you wanna have paid.

239
00:14:20,449 --> 00:14:22,463
- You never would've paid.
- Who would pay for shit?

240
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:27,260
Exactly. I mean we just had to...

241
00:14:27,451 --> 00:14:28,602
What the hell
are you doing here?

242
00:14:28,986 --> 00:14:30,521
What's up?

243
00:14:30,521 --> 00:14:33,974
Let me guess,
my foot in your arse.

244
00:14:34,454 --> 00:14:36,948
Game o'cards - Hatchet Harry?

245
00:14:37,044 --> 00:14:39,058
You're supposed to be
getting your rest in, boy.

246
00:14:40,017 --> 00:14:43,183
You playing cards
tonight, son?

247
00:14:44,909 --> 00:14:45,868
With Harry?

248
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:50,569
Don't be silly, Dad. I wouldn't
have anything to do with that.

249
00:14:59,873 --> 00:15:01,216
Where did
he get a hundred grand?

250
00:15:01,408 --> 00:15:03,806
He's got adhesive mates -
I mean they're Iike brothers.

251
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:05,628
They've tossed up
between 'em.

252
00:15:05,724 --> 00:15:08,218
And JD is his dad,
and owns the whole property?

253
00:15:08,314 --> 00:15:10,137
No mortgage, no debts.

254
00:15:10,329 --> 00:15:12,823
Lock, stock - the fucking lot.

255
00:15:13,015 --> 00:15:16,084
Don't you worry, Harry.
I've got it under control.

256
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:18,578
Good. You can get this
under contol now.

257
00:15:18,674 --> 00:15:20,976
It seems that Lord Appleton Smythe
has run out of money.

258
00:15:21,072 --> 00:15:23,182
and these little beauties
are up for auction.

259
00:15:23,854 --> 00:15:26,156
But I'm not paying a quarter
of a million quid for 'em.

260
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:28,266
If you know what I mean,
Barry.

261
00:15:28,362 --> 00:15:31,623
Make sure we get everything
from inside the gun cabinet.

262
00:15:31,719 --> 00:15:33,350
I don't want to know who you use,

263
00:15:33,446 --> 00:15:35,556
as long as they're not
complete muppets.

264
00:15:36,611 --> 00:15:39,105
And don't tell 'em
what they're worth, Barry.

# When everything

268
00:15:47,451 --> 00:15:48,985
Right, where was we?

269
00:15:49,849 --> 00:15:53,782
Shotguns. What, like guns that fire shots?

270
00:15:53,877 --> 00:15:55,412
Oh, you must be the brains, then.

271
00:15:55,412 --> 00:15:57,235
That's right,
guns that fire shots.

272
00:15:57,906 --> 00:16:01,455
Make sure you bring everything
from inside the gun cabinet.

273
00:16:01,551 --> 00:16:04,333
There'll be a load of old guns.
That's all I want.

274
00:16:04,429 --> 00:16:07,882
Everything else outside the cabinet,
you can keep, it's yours.

275
00:16:07,882 --> 00:16:09,609
Oh, thank you very much.

276
00:16:09,992 --> 00:16:11,623
There'd better
be something there for us.

277
00:16:11,815 --> 00:16:13,542
It's a fucking
stately home,

278
00:16:13,829 --> 00:16:15,556
of course there'll
be something there.

279
00:16:15,748 --> 00:16:18,146
- Like what?
- Like fucking antiques.

280
00:16:18,721 --> 00:16:22,079
Antiques! What the fuck
do we know about antiques?

281
00:16:22,175 --> 00:16:24,189
- We rob post offices.
- We steal cars.

282
00:16:24,381 --> 00:16:26,779
What the fuck do we know
about antiques, mate?

283
00:16:27,163 --> 00:16:30,328
If it looks old,
it's worth money - simple.

284
00:16:30,424 --> 00:16:34,069
So stop fucking moaning
and rob the place.

285
00:16:34,261 --> 00:16:36,947
So who's the guv?
Who are we doing this for?

286
00:16:37,043 --> 00:16:40,496
You're doing it for me -
is all you need to know.

287
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:43,853
You know
because you need to know.

288
00:16:43,949 --> 00:16:48,361
I see. One of those on a
"need to know basis" things, is it ?

289
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:51,623
Like one of those
James Bond films.

290
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:55,076
Careful, remember who's giving
you this job.

291
00:16:56,131 --> 00:16:58,913
Right, I'm off.
Call me when you're done.

292
00:16:59,488 --> 00:17:00,448
Ta-ra.

293
00:17:03,805 --> 00:17:06,011
Fucking northern monkeys.

294
00:17:08,889 --> 00:17:11,767
I hate these fucking
southern fairies.

since he could lift 'em up.'

296
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:23,661
'And he soon discovered
that he had a big advantage.'

297
00:17:23,757 --> 00:17:25,196
'It's not that he's good with cards,'

298
00:17:25,388 --> 00:17:26,922
'or even good at counting them.'

299
00:17:27,018 --> 00:17:29,224
'It's that he's good
with reading people's reactions'

300
00:17:29,416 --> 00:17:31,239
'no matter how subtle.'

301
00:17:31,335 --> 00:17:34,404
'And everybody has reactions.'

302
00:17:35,747 --> 00:17:38,817
'Especially when
it comes to money.'

303
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:42,558
# Love is kind of crazy

304
00:17:42,654 --> 00:17:45,339
# With a spooky
little boy like you ##

305
00:17:50,231 --> 00:17:52,150
- Invitations.
- Invitations?

306
00:17:52,342 --> 00:17:57,426
Yeah, invitations, you know, four pretty
white pieces of paper with your names on.

307
00:17:57,522 --> 00:18:00,399
We got 100,000 bits of paper
with the Queen's head on.

308
00:18:00,399 --> 00:18:01,550
Will that do?

309
00:18:01,742 --> 00:18:05,867
Just you. The others, they can wait
next door in Samoan Jo's.

310
00:18:05,867 --> 00:18:08,361
Samoan Jo's?
You mean the pub? Hold on...

311
00:18:08,553 --> 00:18:12,294
Hold on to your fuckin' tongue
and I'll hold on to my patience, OK, sonny ?

312
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:16,035
No one in here tonight but card players
and I do mean: no one.

313
00:18:22,845 --> 00:18:25,243
Evening, Fraser. Don, Phil.

314
00:18:25,339 --> 00:18:27,449
It's a bit dramatic, innit?

315
00:18:28,696 --> 00:18:31,094
Is it supposed to be symbolic?

316
00:18:30,231 --> 00:18:32,725
Apparently it's for security.

317
00:18:31,958 --> 00:18:34,835
Yeah? I'd have brought my gloves
if I'd have known.

318
00:18:35,699 --> 00:18:37,905
You must be Eddy, JD's son.

319
00:18:38,289 --> 00:18:43,085
You must be Harry.
Sorry, didn't know your father.

320
00:18:43,277 --> 00:18:47,401
Never mind, son, you just might meet him
if you carry on like that.

321
00:18:48,169 --> 00:18:50,471
Evening, Tanya. Been a while.

322
00:18:50,663 --> 00:18:52,101
All right, Ed.

323
00:19:11,382 --> 00:19:13,684
Right, we call each other Kenny,
OK, Gary?

324
00:19:13,876 --> 00:19:14,835
All right, Kenny.

325
00:19:15,602 --> 00:19:17,233
You gonna put your stocking on, or what?

326
00:19:17,713 --> 00:19:19,439
I spent 120 quid on my hair -

327
00:19:19,439 --> 00:19:21,933
If you think I'm pulling a stocking over,
you're very much mistaken.

328
00:19:21,933 --> 00:19:23,948
You're gonna have to put something on.

329
00:19:26,921 --> 00:19:28,360
This is three card brag, gentlemen.

330
00:19:28,456 --> 00:19:31,142
That means three 3s are the highest,
then three aces,

331
00:19:31,334 --> 00:19:32,677
then running down accordingly.

332
00:19:32,964 --> 00:19:36,226
Then it's a running flush,
a run, a flush and then a pair.

333
00:19:36,609 --> 00:19:38,624
An open man can't
see a blind man.

334
00:19:38,816 --> 00:19:41,885
And it will cost twice the ante
to see your opponent.

335
00:19:42,365 --> 00:19:43,900
Now don't fuck around, fellas.

336
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:47,832
You know the rules.
And you know I won't stand for it.

337
00:20:04,427 --> 00:20:06,537
What are you doing?
Put that back.

338
00:20:06,921 --> 00:20:08,552
We're here to rob the guns.

339
00:20:09,319 --> 00:20:12,197
Put it back - it's crap anyway.

340
00:20:14,019 --> 00:20:15,746
Come on.

341
00:20:33,108 --> 00:20:35,122
What sort of pub is this here ?

342
00:20:35,218 --> 00:20:36,849
It's a Samoan pub.

343
00:20:37,616 --> 00:20:38,767
What's that?

344
00:20:39,535 --> 00:20:41,453
It's a cocktail -
you asked for a cocktail.

345
00:20:41,645 --> 00:20:45,482
No, I asked you to give me
a refreshing drink.

346
00:20:45,866 --> 00:20:48,455
I wasn't expecting
a fucking rainforest.

347
00:20:48,551 --> 00:20:51,141
You could fall in love
with an orangutang in that.

348
00:20:51,525 --> 00:20:53,539
You want a pint, go to the pub.

349
00:20:55,362 --> 00:20:56,801
I thought this was a pub.

350
00:20:56,897 --> 00:20:58,623
It's a Samoan pub.

351
00:20:59,103 --> 00:21:02,460
Then whatever it is, can you get your man
to turn the TV down?

352
00:21:02,556 --> 00:21:05,338
You can ask him if you like.
If I was you I'd leave him well alone.

353
00:21:05,434 --> 00:21:07,640
Yeah. Get rid of that.
Bring us a Diet Coke.

354
00:21:07,736 --> 00:21:11,956
'Scuse me, can you
turn that TV down?

355
00:21:17,328 --> 00:21:18,863
No.

356
00:21:22,316 --> 00:21:24,139
Oooh!

357
00:21:29,222 --> 00:21:31,429
Whoa, whoa, Kenny.

358
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:33,155
What are you doing?

359
00:21:33,347 --> 00:21:37,280
I am trying to find out
where they keep their money!

360
00:21:39,102 --> 00:21:41,309
You twat. Can't you see
these people have got no money.

361
00:21:41,692 --> 00:21:43,419
They can't even afford
new furniture.

362
00:21:43,995 --> 00:21:45,817
We've got the guns.
What's the matter with you ?

363
00:21:46,393 --> 00:21:49,078
Every time we do a job,
you have to go burn people's feet.

364
00:21:49,078 --> 00:21:50,517
What's wrong with you?

365
00:22:00,397 --> 00:22:02,220
You wanna be more careful, old fella.

366
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:05,577
You very nearly took my man's
head clean off with that.

367
00:22:05,673 --> 00:22:07,687
You all right, Kenny?

368
00:22:07,783 --> 00:22:09,318
Kenny?

369
00:22:15,169 --> 00:22:17,280
Ten grand, blind.

370
00:22:20,829 --> 00:22:21,980
Twenty grand, open.

371
00:22:24,282 --> 00:22:25,241
Deep end, eh?

372
00:22:26,872 --> 00:22:28,119
Fold.

373
00:22:45,673 --> 00:22:47,112
Gotcha!

374
00:22:58,814 --> 00:23:00,157
Twenty grand, open.

375
00:23:02,843 --> 00:23:04,090
I fold.

376
00:23:05,049 --> 00:23:08,214
Don't go spending that
all at once, boy.

377
00:23:13,682 --> 00:23:16,368
Bloody 'ell!

378
00:23:16,464 --> 00:23:17,999
What?

379
00:23:18,094 --> 00:23:19,917
I thought you said there'd
be no staff, Barry.

380
00:23:20,013 --> 00:23:21,740
Did you get those guns?

381
00:23:21,931 --> 00:23:23,754
You wanna see
what they did to poor Gary!

382
00:23:24,905 --> 00:23:27,015
Gary, Gary.

383
00:23:27,111 --> 00:23:29,126
I said, did you get those guns?

384
00:23:29,221 --> 00:23:31,044
Yes, we got them!

385
00:23:31,332 --> 00:23:34,114
Good. I'll speak to you later.

386
00:23:35,169 --> 00:23:36,799
Gary, if you can hear me,

387
00:23:37,183 --> 00:23:39,389
get back in the car now, mate, it's OK.

388
00:23:39,773 --> 00:23:41,883
Barry... Barry!

389
00:23:44,281 --> 00:23:46,679
Fucking, sodding,
shandy-drinking bastard!

390
00:23:46,679 --> 00:23:48,022
Gary !

00:24:49,221 --> 00:24:50,084
Give me my money!

407
00:24:50,564 --> 00:24:52,482
Give me back my money!
You fucking slags!

408
00:24:55,935 --> 00:24:56,991
Give me my money !

409
00:24:57,374 --> 00:24:58,909
Give me back my money!

410
00:24:59,293 --> 00:25:01,019
Give it back!

411
00:25:01,211 --> 00:25:03,897
Wankers! Wankers!

412
00:25:08,213 --> 00:25:10,324

413
00:25:10,803 --> 00:25:13,297
Not now, oh you fucking bastard!

00:25:19,053 --> 00:25:22,218
Fuck...you bastard.

415
00:25:22,890 --> 00:25:25,096
Oh, my good God!

416
00:25:25,192 --> 00:25:27,110
We'll take you to the cleaners!

417
00:25:35,072 --> 00:25:37,949
Twenty grand open.

418
00:25:39,101 --> 00:25:40,827
Thirty thousand.

419
00:25:41,307 --> 00:25:43,033
Back to you already, Eddie.

420
00:25:45,144 --> 00:25:46,870
Fifty grand.

421
00:25:49,172 --> 00:25:51,283
Eighty grand.

422
00:25:52,626 --> 00:25:53,873
One hundred grand.

423
00:25:53,968 --> 00:25:56,654
Whoa, whoa whoa.
Look, fellas, I know...

424
00:25:56,654 --> 00:25:57,997
I know you're not in,

425
00:25:57,997 --> 00:26:00,683
which means no one cares
what you know.

426
00:26:01,930 --> 00:26:03,944
Two hundred and fifty.

427
00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:09,028
That's quite a raise.

428
00:26:09,988 --> 00:26:12,577
That's one hundred and fifty
on my one hundred.

429
00:26:12,865 --> 00:26:16,127
Yeah, and is there anything else
you want to say?

430
00:26:17,565 --> 00:26:20,539
As you know, this puts us
in an awkward position.

431
00:26:22,074 --> 00:26:23,704
I don't have enough
to continue.

432
00:26:24,184 --> 00:26:27,541
We will have to see both your cards
if no one loans Eddie the money to continue.

433
00:26:27,637 --> 00:26:29,556
It's a loan
or we see both your cards.

434
00:26:36,366 --> 00:26:37,325
I will.

435
00:26:39,915 --> 00:26:41,354
You will what?

436
00:26:42,985 --> 00:26:45,287
I will loan you the money.

437
00:26:48,261 --> 00:26:50,946
No, I think I'd rather
just turn 'em over.

438
00:26:51,522 --> 00:26:53,728
I'm not interested
in what you would rather.

439
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:55,934
I wanna keep going.

440
00:26:56,318 --> 00:26:58,237
I'm also offering you the money.

441
00:26:59,579 --> 00:27:02,361
So we don't have to turn 'em over
because you can borrow.

442
00:27:04,376 --> 00:27:06,774
I need two hundred
and fifty grand.

443
00:27:06,965 --> 00:27:10,419
No, you need five hundred
grand to see me.

444
00:27:12,145 --> 00:27:13,776
That's if I wanna see you.

445
00:27:13,968 --> 00:27:17,133
Well, you're gonna have a problem
carrying on, ain't ya?

446
00:27:20,299 --> 00:27:21,546
I'll see you.

447
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:27,109
OK, before I loan you this,
I expect -

448
00:27:27,205 --> 00:27:28,740
- if you lose, of course -

449
00:27:28,836 --> 00:27:30,850
my money back within a week.

450
00:27:31,809 --> 00:27:34,495
Crystal? That's Sunday, OK?

451
00:28:01,737 --> 00:28:03,464
Is that it?

452
00:28:03,943 --> 00:28:07,301
Now let's see his fucking cards.

453
00:28:17,469 --> 00:28:20,442
# "l Wanna Be Your Dog" #

00:28:29,171 --> 00:28:32,432
# ln my room I want you here

456
00:28:36,845 --> 00:28:40,202
# Now we're gonna be

457
00:28:44,231 --> 00:28:47,588
# And I'll lay right down
in my favourite place

458
00:28:51,713 --> 00:28:55,837
# And now I wanna be your dog

459
00:28:55,933 --> 00:28:59,483
# And now I wanna be your dog

460
00:28:59,674 --> 00:29:02,840
# And now I wanna be your dog #

461
00:29:10,514 --> 00:29:12,528
# Well, come on! ##

462
00:29:14,830 --> 00:29:17,516
Hello, boy.
Feeling a bit poorly?

463
00:29:17,996 --> 00:29:19,339
I know your friends

464
00:29:19,434 --> 00:29:21,928
are responsible
for most of the cash...

465
00:29:22,024 --> 00:29:24,902
so I'm gonna give you
one week to find it.

466
00:29:25,190 --> 00:29:28,547
Otherwise I will take a finger

467
00:29:28,643 --> 00:29:30,849
of each of you
and your friends' hands

468
00:29:31,137 --> 00:29:33,823
for every day that passes
without payment.

469
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:35,837
And then when you've
run out of digits -

470
00:29:36,221 --> 00:29:39,674
your dad's bar,
and who knows what then.

471
00:29:39,866 --> 00:29:41,401
All right, my son?

472
00:29:44,087 --> 00:29:46,389
# "Why Did You Do lt?" #

473
00:29:46,485 --> 00:29:50,130
# I've been thinking
about what you have done to me

474
00:29:50,226 --> 00:29:54,542
# The damage is much deeper
than you'll ever see

475
00:29:54,638 --> 00:29:56,365
# Hit me like a hammer
to my head ##

476
00:29:57,995 --> 00:30:00,010
This doesn't look good.

477
00:30:04,230 --> 00:30:07,300
'He then proceeded to explain the unfortunate
position they were in.'

478
00:30:07,492 --> 00:30:10,561
'Harry was going to start sizing up
all their fingers in a week.

479
00:30:10,657 --> 00:30:14,014
'Because he knew there was no way Ed
could settle that debt on his own.'

480
00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:16,412
'Harry saw it
as their money on the table,'

481
00:30:16,604 --> 00:30:19,386
'so it was also their debt
off the table.'

482
00:30:19,578 --> 00:30:23,031
'Ed would hate to admit it, but he could've
kissed the old bastard for that.'

483
00:30:23,127 --> 00:30:25,237
'lf he said he wanted
to settle the debt on his own,'

484
00:30:25,237 --> 00:30:26,388
'it would have been a lie.'

485
00:30:27,348 --> 00:30:30,609
I wish to Christ he would've
let me settle the debt on my own.

486
00:30:33,582 --> 00:30:36,076
- I'm gonna kill him!
- Stop fucking about, Tom.

487
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:39,722
Now think about what
we're gonna do. Now sit down.

488
00:30:44,134 --> 00:30:45,861
What's all the fuss
about Harry?

489
00:30:46,052 --> 00:30:47,779
Why don't we just
boycott the payment?

490
00:30:50,753 --> 00:30:52,575
Let me tell you
about Hatchet Harry.

491
00:30:53,630 --> 00:30:57,563
Once was this geezer, called Smithy
Robinson, who worked for Harry.

492
00:30:57,947 --> 00:30:59,769
But it was rumoured
that he was on the take.

493
00:31:00,345 --> 00:31:02,839
Harry's invited Smithy round
for an explanation.

494
00:31:02,935 --> 00:31:05,141
Smithy didn't
do a very good job.

495
00:31:05,621 --> 00:31:06,484
Within a minute...

496
00:31:06,772 --> 00:31:08,115
Harry's lost his rag.

497
00:31:08,306 --> 00:31:09,649
Reached out for the nearest
thing at hand -

498
00:31:09,745 --> 00:31:12,431
which happened to be
a 15-inch black rubber cock.

499
00:31:13,103 --> 00:31:17,131
He's then proceeded to batter
poor Smithy to death with it.

500
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:22,983
Now that was seen as
a pleasant way to go.

501
00:31:23,174 --> 00:31:27,395
Hence Hatchet Harry
is a man you pay if you owe.

502
00:31:29,505 --> 00:31:32,479
Don't worry,
I'll think of something.

503
00:31:33,630 --> 00:31:36,987
# I've been thinking
about what you have done to me

504
00:31:37,371 --> 00:31:40,728
# lmages much deeper
than you'll ever see

505
00:31:42,167 --> 00:31:46,675
# Hit me like
a hammer to my head

506
00:31:46,867 --> 00:31:50,512
# I wonder were you pushed
or were you led?

507
00:31:51,567 --> 00:31:53,582
# Why did you do it?

508
00:31:54,061 --> 00:31:55,788
# Why did you do
that thing to me? ##

509
00:32:00,392 --> 00:32:04,037
Golf - the best way
to spoil a good walk.

510
00:32:10,752 --> 00:32:12,670
Winston Churchill said that.

511
00:32:13,534 --> 00:32:15,740
I say it's a dog-eat-dog world.

512
00:32:15,836 --> 00:32:18,042
And I got
bigger teeth than you two.

513
00:32:20,536 --> 00:32:23,222
I think our friend is trying
to tell us something.

514
00:32:23,606 --> 00:32:26,291
Perhaps not. Perhaps I should take
another swing just to make sure?

515
00:32:26,483 --> 00:32:28,114
Give me a five iron, John.

516
00:32:28,306 --> 00:32:29,649
Certainly, Dog.

517
00:32:32,814 --> 00:32:34,445
Now, keep still.

518
00:32:43,270 --> 00:32:45,476
Yes, Gordon, is there something
you'd like to tell us?

519
00:32:47,203 --> 00:32:49,217
- It's in the fireplace.
- Shut it, you idiot, he'll kill...

520
00:32:51,807 --> 00:32:52,958
Yes, Gordon, you were saying?

521
00:32:53,054 --> 00:32:55,740
It's in the fireplace.
Just pull it out. It's in the bottom.

522
00:32:56,603 --> 00:32:58,905
It's in the fireplace, Frank.
Just pull it out.

523
00:32:59,289 --> 00:33:00,248
It's in the bottom.

524
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:04,277
Oh, Dog, I think you might wanna
have a look at this!

525
00:33:06,771 --> 00:33:08,018
You gonna let me down now?

526
00:33:08,210 --> 00:33:10,991
No, I'm not
finished with you yet.

527
00:33:12,046 --> 00:33:13,485
Steel.

528
00:33:16,171 --> 00:33:18,281
Help! Help!

529
00:33:23,557 --> 00:33:24,996
Oh, Dog.

530
00:33:30,368 --> 00:33:33,437
Who the hell's that?
It's only 12 o'clock.

531
00:33:34,205 --> 00:33:36,986
Use the cage,
that's what it's there for.

532
00:33:41,591 --> 00:33:42,742
Who is it?

533
00:33:48,785 --> 00:33:51,375
We have got security
for a reason, Willie.

534
00:33:51,566 --> 00:33:54,828
Chill, Winston. It's only Plank.

535
00:33:56,650 --> 00:33:59,816
This weed's getting quite a rep,
you know, fellas, all right ?

536
00:33:59,816 --> 00:34:00,967
Easy.

537
00:34:01,446 --> 00:34:02,693
Jesus!

538
00:34:03,461 --> 00:34:04,900
Never saw you there.

539
00:34:05,092 --> 00:34:07,202
Hello, love,
enjoying yourself?

540
00:34:08,737 --> 00:34:10,080
Is she compos?

541
00:34:10,175 --> 00:34:11,614
What do you think?

542
00:34:14,588 --> 00:34:15,739
Boo!

543
00:34:15,835 --> 00:34:17,561
Fuck me!

544
00:34:17,657 --> 00:34:19,480
Clean that up, Charles.

545
00:34:19,576 --> 00:34:21,111
Sod you, you clean it up.

546
00:34:21,207 --> 00:34:24,756
Sorry, fellas, but that stupid cow
scared the fucking life out of me!

547
00:34:25,523 --> 00:34:29,456
Never mind. Can you just
sit down, stay out the way?

548
00:34:32,525 --> 00:34:34,348
Look, how much is it you want?

549
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:36,842
I'm...after an half weight.

550
00:34:37,034 --> 00:34:41,350
Right. Well, that's 1,500 then.
Pass the scales, Willie.

551
00:34:43,269 --> 00:34:44,803
Give us some gear, J.

552
00:34:48,353 --> 00:34:52,094
Any chance of actually
seeing the...money?

553
00:35:00,535 --> 00:35:02,261
The odds are 100-1.

554
00:35:02,837 --> 00:35:04,659
All is we need is five grand.

555
00:35:05,331 --> 00:35:07,825
I'd rather put my money
on a three-legged rockin' horse.

556
00:35:08,017 --> 00:35:12,141
The odds are 100-1 for a good
reason, Bacon - it won't win!

557
00:35:13,388 --> 00:35:16,170
- Where's Eddie?
- Where do you think?

558
00:35:16,554 --> 00:35:19,240
The bottom of a bottle,
and has been for two days.

559
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:22,405
- It's hit him hard.
- Yeah, it's hit us all hard!

560
00:35:22,405 --> 00:35:25,379
Yeah, but he's got to tell his dad
he's about to lose his bar.

561
00:35:25,379 --> 00:35:26,530
Listen to this one.

562
00:35:27,009 --> 00:35:30,175
You open up a company, called
"Arse Ticklers Faggots Fan Club"

563
00:35:30,271 --> 00:35:33,052
- You what?
- You take out an advert in the back
page of some gay mag,

564
00:35:33,436 --> 00:35:37,081
advertising the latest
in arse-intruding dildos.

565
00:35:37,465 --> 00:35:39,767
You sell it with...I dunno....

566
00:35:39,863 --> 00:35:42,069
"Does what no other
dildo can do until now"

567
00:35:42,069 --> 00:35:44,179
"The latest and greatest
in sexual technology"

568
00:35:44,179 --> 00:35:46,002
"Guaranteed results or money back",
all that bollocks."

569
00:35:46,098 --> 00:35:48,976
Now, these dilds cost 25 quid a pop -

570
00:35:49,072 --> 00:35:52,333
that's a snip for the amount of pleasure
they're gonna give the recipients.

571
00:35:52,333 --> 00:35:54,827
They send their cheques
to the other company name.

572
00:35:55,115 --> 00:35:59,239
Nothing offensive, "Bobby's Bits"
or something, for 25 quid.

573
00:35:59,239 --> 00:36:02,501
You take that 25 quid,
you stick it in the bank until it clears.

574
00:36:02,597 --> 00:36:04,131
Now this is the smart bit.

575
00:36:04,803 --> 00:36:07,489
You send back the cheque
for 25 pound

576
00:36:07,585 --> 00:36:09,215
from the other company name -

577
00:36:09,311 --> 00:36:12,093
"Arse Ticklers Faggots Fan Club" -
saying "We're sorry,"

578
00:36:12,189 --> 00:36:15,450
we couldn't get the supplies from
America - because they ran out of stock.

579
00:36:15,642 --> 00:36:18,807
Now you see, how many people
cash that cheque.

580
00:36:19,383 --> 00:36:21,206
Not a single soul.

581
00:36:21,397 --> 00:36:25,906
Because who wants their bank manager
to know they tickle arse when he is
not paying in cheques!

582
00:36:27,153 --> 00:36:28,687
So how long do you have to wait
till you see a return?

583
00:36:28,783 --> 00:36:30,606
Probably
no more than four weeks.

584
00:36:30,606 --> 00:36:37,608
A month ? So what fucking good is that
if we need it in six - no, five days?

585
00:36:37,992 --> 00:36:39,527
Well, it's still a good idea.

586
00:36:41,157 --> 00:36:45,378
He may know we smoke a lot, burn a bit
of profit, but he can't have any idea

587
00:36:45,378 --> 00:36:48,256
how much hard currency
we've accumulated.

588
00:36:48,543 --> 00:36:51,517
I don't know. Do you know?

589
00:36:52,668 --> 00:36:55,354
We can just...slice it
off the top.

590
00:36:56,121 --> 00:36:59,287
You guys have got
to realise who this chap is.

591
00:36:59,287 --> 00:37:02,452
He might look a bit silly,
but he's a fucking lunatic.

592
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:05,714
If he gets the slightest inkling we're not
throwing straight dice,

593
00:37:05,809 --> 00:37:06,961
you and me are gonna know

594
00:37:06,961 --> 00:37:10,318
what the sharp side
of a kebab knife feels like.

595
00:37:10,414 --> 00:37:12,140
So you know these geezers well?

596
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:13,100
Well enough -

597
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:15,306
I've been buying gear off one
of 'em for a coupla years.

598
00:37:15,690 --> 00:37:18,567
- So what they like, then?
- Poofs! Nothing heavy.

599
00:37:18,567 --> 00:37:20,677
Four public school boys,
soft as shite.

600
00:37:41,589 --> 00:37:43,795
They ponce around in funny hippy clothes
all day talking bollocks

601
00:37:44,178 --> 00:37:45,809
they're just good at growing weed, that's all.

602
00:37:46,193 --> 00:37:48,303
Business has got bigger
than what they could handle.

603
00:37:49,454 --> 00:37:50,989
They can't all be stupid, can they ?

604
00:37:51,373 --> 00:37:55,114
Think about it, they got a container
load of cash in shoe boxes,

605
00:37:55,210 --> 00:37:56,648
they're selling class A gear -

606
00:37:56,744 --> 00:37:59,142
can't you figure out
there's someone sensible involved ?

607
00:37:59,238 --> 00:38:00,485
What about security?

608
00:38:00,485 --> 00:38:02,883
There's one steel gate as you go in,
but they never lock it.

609
00:38:03,267 --> 00:38:05,761
What d'you mean they never lock it?
Why've they got it for there, then?

610
00:38:05,857 --> 00:38:07,967
I must've been there 50 times -
it's never locked.

611
00:38:08,159 --> 00:38:11,037
They're not suspicious. Everyone
that goes there's a toff.

612
00:38:11,133 --> 00:38:12,572
They're all into that karma crap -

613
00:38:12,763 --> 00:38:15,066
"If I don't harm nobody,
nobody harms me" stuff.

614
00:38:15,737 --> 00:38:17,080
No way they can get back to you?

615
00:38:17,368 --> 00:38:20,053
Even if they could, they'd be too shit scared -
I'm a geezer.

616
00:38:20,149 --> 00:38:22,547
They got no muscle - gutless faggots.

617
00:38:24,178 --> 00:38:25,905
Fancy one?

618
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:29,933
What's all the flapping about?
You told the old man yet?

619
00:38:30,317 --> 00:38:32,236
Hoping I won't need to.

620
00:38:32,907 --> 00:38:35,497
I've got a plan.
Now listen carefully.

621
00:38:46,816 --> 00:38:48,542
- Hello, boys.
- Harry.

622
00:38:49,406 --> 00:38:50,365
Do you want a drink?

623
00:38:50,557 --> 00:38:53,243
Hello, my son.
D'you want a lolly?

624
00:38:53,435 --> 00:38:55,065
Piss off, you nonce.

625
00:38:55,161 --> 00:38:56,984
Oi, watch it!

626
00:38:57,175 --> 00:38:59,574
No, thanks, Harry.
We're both all right.

627
00:39:00,149 --> 00:39:01,588
Nice shooter.

628
00:39:01,972 --> 00:39:04,562
Yeah, one of a pair -
Holland and Holland.

629
00:39:04,753 --> 00:39:05,713
D'you wanna hold it?

630
00:39:05,904 --> 00:39:07,823
No, not my thing, thanks, Harry.

631
00:39:08,015 --> 00:39:10,317
Business good?
I imagine that's why I'm here.

632
00:39:10,892 --> 00:39:13,195
Four young fellas got in deeper
than they could handle.

633
00:39:13,674 --> 00:39:15,880
They owe me
half a million pound.

634
00:39:15,976 --> 00:39:18,758
- How much?
- Half a million.

635
00:39:21,252 --> 00:39:22,595
I'm game.

636
00:39:24,417 --> 00:39:25,664
Me too.

637
00:39:27,391 --> 00:39:28,926
Oh, God!

638
00:39:29,214 --> 00:39:33,242
Right. We hit 'em
as soon as they come back.

639
00:39:33,818 --> 00:39:36,024
We'll be prepared. Waiting.

640
00:39:37,751 --> 00:39:38,902
And they're armed.

641
00:39:38,998 --> 00:39:41,012
What was that? Armed?

642
00:39:41,492 --> 00:39:44,082
What d'you mean armed?
Armed with what?

643
00:39:44,273 --> 00:39:47,151
Bad breath, colourful language,
feather duster?

644
00:39:47,247 --> 00:39:49,741
What do you think
they're gonna be armed with?
Guns, you tit!

645
00:39:49,933 --> 00:39:50,700
Guns ?

646
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:53,194
You never said
anything about guns.

647
00:39:53,386 --> 00:39:55,496
A minute ago this was
the safest job in the world.

648
00:39:55,688 --> 00:39:57,798
Now it's turning into
a bad day in Bosnia!

649
00:39:58,086 --> 00:40:00,292
Soap, stop being such a mincer.

650
00:40:00,772 --> 00:40:03,170
- I've thought about that and...
- And what exactly?

651
00:40:03,458 --> 00:40:08,158
And... all we have to do is find out
who's carrying 'em.

652
00:40:08,158 --> 00:40:11,899
Carying them ?
Well, they could all be carrying 'em
for what we know.

653
00:40:12,091 --> 00:40:14,777
No. Only one of 'em carries
them going to the job.

654
00:40:15,065 --> 00:40:18,901
So I assume the same one will be carry 'em
when they come back from the job.

655
00:40:19,093 --> 00:40:20,628
Oh - you assume, dear?

656
00:40:20,724 --> 00:40:23,506
And what did I say about assumption -
being the brother of all fuck-ups?

657
00:40:23,793 --> 00:40:25,328
It's the mother of all fuck-ups,
you stupid!

658
00:40:25,328 --> 00:40:27,534
Well, brother, mother,
any other sucker.

659
00:40:27,822 --> 00:40:29,453
It don't make any difference.

660
00:40:30,412 --> 00:40:34,729
They're still fucking guns and
they still fire fucking bullets!

661
00:40:35,016 --> 00:40:39,621
Soap, if you have a better idea
how to get £500,000

662
00:40:39,813 --> 00:40:42,690
in the next few days,
let us know.

663
00:40:44,225 --> 00:40:45,088
In the meantime, Tom,

664
00:40:45,184 --> 00:40:47,294
you talk to Nick the Bubble
about shifting the weed.

665
00:40:54,201 --> 00:40:56,311
- Weed?
- No, it's not normal weed.

666
00:40:56,407 --> 00:40:58,901
It's some fucked-up skunk, Class A,

667
00:40:58,997 --> 00:41:01,203
"l can't think
let alone move" shit.

668
00:41:01,299 --> 00:41:02,642
Doesn't sound
very good to me.

669
00:41:02,834 --> 00:41:05,232
Oh, neither me - it depends
what flicks your switch.

670
00:41:05,903 --> 00:41:08,014
And the light is on and burning
brightly for the masses.

671
00:41:08,685 --> 00:41:10,124
Anyway, do you know anyone?

672
00:41:11,179 --> 00:41:12,426
I know a man, yes.

673
00:41:13,673 --> 00:41:15,879
Rory Breaker.

674
00:41:16,071 --> 00:41:18,086
Not that madman with an afro?

675
00:41:18,182 --> 00:41:20,100
I don't want anything
to do with him.

676
00:41:20,292 --> 00:41:23,169
You won't have to.
Just get me a sample.

677
00:41:23,553 --> 00:41:25,663
No can do.

678
00:41:25,951 --> 00:41:28,541
What's that -
a place near Kathmandu?

679
00:41:28,733 --> 00:41:30,076
Meet me half-way, mate.

680
00:41:30,076 --> 00:41:31,898
It's all completely
chicken soup.

681
00:41:32,474 --> 00:41:35,256
- It's what?
- It's kosher...as Christmas.

682
00:41:35,352 --> 00:41:37,270
Jews don't
celebrate Christmas, Tom.

683
00:41:38,037 --> 00:41:40,436
No, I never mind that.
I'm gonna need some artillery, too.

684
00:41:40,531 --> 00:41:42,066
Coupla sawn-off shotguns.

685
00:41:42,162 --> 00:41:44,560
This is a bit heavy. This is London,
not the Lebanon.

686
00:41:44,848 --> 00:41:46,287
Who d'you think I am?

687
00:41:46,479 --> 00:41:49,069
I think you're Nick the Greek.

688
00:41:49,356 --> 00:41:50,507
Hold those two.

689
00:41:52,810 --> 00:41:55,399
I don't normally have
anything to do with weed, Nick.

690
00:41:55,495 --> 00:41:57,510
But if it is
what he says it is,

691
00:41:57,702 --> 00:42:00,196
I'll take it off him for
three and a half grand a key.

692
00:42:00,675 --> 00:42:03,457
That is if it is what he says it is.

693
00:42:03,649 --> 00:42:05,471
I don't want to see it
after a sample,

694
00:42:05,663 --> 00:42:07,678
I don't want to touch it
after a sample.

695
00:42:07,869 --> 00:42:10,843
I'll leave you in the capable
hands of Nathan here.

696
00:42:11,035 --> 00:42:13,241
He'll sort out the details.

697
00:42:13,241 --> 00:42:15,447
But just let me tell you
one thing...

698
00:42:19,860 --> 00:42:21,970
If the milk turns out
to be sour,

699
00:42:22,162 --> 00:42:25,135
I ain't the kind
of pussy to drink it.

700
00:42:27,150 --> 00:42:28,589
D'you know what I mean?

701
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:36,358
- Rory Breaker.
- Rory ?

702
00:42:36,550 --> 00:42:39,716
You don't know Rory. He's not
to be underestimated.

703
00:42:40,003 --> 00:42:41,538
He's a funny-looking
fucker, I know.

704
00:42:41,730 --> 00:42:44,224
But you've got to look past the hair
and the cute cuddly thing.

705
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:46,814
It's all a deceptive façade.

706
00:42:48,253 --> 00:42:51,802
A few nights ago
Rory's roger iron busted.

707
00:42:51,994 --> 00:42:55,543
So he's gone down the battle cruiser
to watch the end of the football game.

708
00:42:55,735 --> 00:42:58,900
No one's watching the custard,
so he switches the channel over.

709
00:42:59,092 --> 00:43:01,490
A fat geezer's north opens.

710
00:43:01,586 --> 00:43:04,176
And he wanders up
and turns the lizar over.

711
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:07,149
"Now fuck off and watch it
somewhere else."

712
00:43:07,725 --> 00:43:09,164
Rory knows claret is imminent,

713
00:43:09,260 --> 00:43:10,890
but he doesn't want to miss
the end of the game.

714
00:43:11,082 --> 00:43:14,248
So calm as a coma, picks up
the fire extinguisher,

715
00:43:14,535 --> 00:43:17,221
walks straight past the jam rolls
who were ready for action

716
00:43:17,317 --> 00:43:19,332
and plonks it outside
the entrance.

717
00:43:19,428 --> 00:43:22,305
He then orders an aristotle
of the most ping-pong tiddly

718
00:43:22,305 --> 00:43:25,854
in the nuclear sub
and switches back to his footer.

719
00:43:26,334 --> 00:43:28,540
"That's fucking it,"
says the geezer.

720
00:43:29,020 --> 00:43:30,842
"That's fucking what?"
says Rory.

721
00:43:31,226 --> 00:43:33,912
And he gobs out a mouthful of booze,
covering Fatty.

722
00:43:33,912 --> 00:43:36,214
He flicks a flaming match
into his bird's nest

723
00:43:36,406 --> 00:43:39,283
and the geezer's lit up
like a leaking gas pipe.

724
00:43:39,571 --> 00:43:42,257
Rory, unfazed,
turns back to his game.

725
00:43:42,449 --> 00:43:45,518
His team's won, too. Four nil.

726
00:44:00,674 --> 00:44:03,744
Oi! ls your hair supposed
to look like that?

727
00:44:04,127 --> 00:44:06,334
- All right, short stuff.
- Never mind short stuff.

728
00:44:06,909 --> 00:44:09,691
Listen, the next time we do a job like this
we're gonna want more money, Barry.

729
00:44:09,883 --> 00:44:12,569
Or we're going back
to post offices and cars. Fuck that!

730
00:44:12,664 --> 00:44:14,487
Where's the others?

731
00:44:15,350 --> 00:44:16,405
There was no others.

732
00:44:16,885 --> 00:44:19,091
Stop fucking around.
The others - the old ones.

733
00:44:19,187 --> 00:44:20,242
I don't know what you mean.

734
00:44:20,338 --> 00:44:22,545
There were two old guns there.
Where are they now?

735
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:25,038
Not in the cabinet, there wasn't.

736
00:44:25,038 --> 00:44:27,724
Oh, there was a couple of old hammer-lock
muskets the butler was carrying.

737
00:44:27,820 --> 00:44:31,753
- But they were ours. We sold them.
- Well you better un-sell 'em, sharpish !

738
00:44:31,849 --> 00:44:33,096
We had to sell them.
We needed the money.

739
00:44:33,288 --> 00:44:35,398
I am not fucking interested.

740
00:44:35,782 --> 00:44:39,043
If you don't wanna be counting
the fingers you haven't got,

741
00:44:39,235 --> 00:44:43,647
I suggest you get those guns.
Quick!

742
00:45:24,798 --> 00:45:28,827
Jesus! lf I pick 'em up,
will they stay in one piece?

743
00:45:29,115 --> 00:45:30,458
Where'd you get them?

744
00:45:31,513 --> 00:45:34,199
I got contacts. Listen, Tom -

745
00:45:34,390 --> 00:45:36,980
you point them at me, I'll shit
myself or do whatever you say to do.

746
00:45:37,076 --> 00:45:38,707
Either way you get
the desired effect.

747
00:45:38,803 --> 00:45:41,201
Oh, they look very nice, I agree, but -

748
00:45:41,681 --> 00:45:43,695
well, they're lacking in criminal
credibility, ain't they?

749
00:45:43,887 --> 00:45:45,038
I might get laughed at.

750
00:45:45,134 --> 00:45:46,573
How much d'you want
for these muskets?

751
00:45:46,669 --> 00:45:47,916
700 each.

752
00:45:47,916 --> 00:45:50,314
And what's that - a pound for every year
they been about?

753
00:45:50,601 --> 00:45:53,959
I know they're antiques, but I ain't
paying antique prices.

754
00:45:56,836 --> 00:45:58,755
They're a bit long, ain't they?

755
00:45:58,851 --> 00:46:00,385
Sawn-offs are out.

756
00:46:00,577 --> 00:46:02,783
People want a bit
more range these days.

757
00:46:03,359 --> 00:46:06,716
Range ? I don't wanna blow the arse
out of this country grounded,

758
00:46:06,812 --> 00:46:09,306
but I don't want anyone
blowing a raspberry either.

759
00:46:10,170 --> 00:46:11,896
I want to look...fucking mean.

760
00:46:12,088 --> 00:46:13,815
Of course you'll look mean.

761
00:46:14,390 --> 00:46:15,541
You'll look really scary.

762
00:46:15,733 --> 00:46:18,419
Enough about that. What about
this geezer who sells drugs?

763
00:46:18,707 --> 00:46:20,625
Rory Breaker's standing by.

764
00:46:20,817 --> 00:46:24,366
You stand to make a lot
of money, tubby Tommy?

765
00:46:29,162 --> 00:46:31,560
I understand if this has come
as a bit of a shock.

766
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:33,383
But let me tell you
how this can be resolved

767
00:46:33,479 --> 00:46:35,781
by you, the good father.

768
00:46:35,877 --> 00:46:37,603
Go on.

769
00:46:37,795 --> 00:46:40,865
- He likes your bar.
- Yes.

770
00:46:40,961 --> 00:46:43,263
He wants your bar.

771
00:46:43,359 --> 00:46:45,757
And?

772
00:46:45,757 --> 00:46:48,155
D'you want me
to draw you a picture?

773
00:46:48,251 --> 00:46:51,608
Look, that boy doesn't know
his arsehole from his earhole.

774
00:46:51,608 --> 00:46:54,869
This is my bar. It's got
nothing to do with him.

775
00:46:54,869 --> 00:46:56,020
What, and I care?

776
00:46:56,884 --> 00:46:59,090
Remember, you do have
the luxurious advantage

777
00:46:59,090 --> 00:47:01,200
of being able to sustain
your son's life.

778
00:47:01,296 --> 00:47:03,119
And you do have a reputation -

779
00:47:03,215 --> 00:47:05,517
so I'll choose my words
very carefully.

780
00:47:05,517 --> 00:47:08,586
You tell Harry
to go fuck himself.

781
00:47:13,191 --> 00:47:14,533
Now...

782
00:47:17,795 --> 00:47:19,809
I'll put that down to shock.

783
00:47:19,905 --> 00:47:21,248
Only once.

784
00:47:22,303 --> 00:47:26,332
Only once can l, or shall l,
let you get away with that.

785
00:47:26,716 --> 00:47:30,265
Your son's got three days
to find half a mill.

786
00:47:30,936 --> 00:47:33,430
But make up your mind
which you prefer -

787
00:47:33,622 --> 00:47:37,651
your bar...or your son.

788
00:47:42,063 --> 00:47:43,214
Plank goes in first.

789
00:47:43,406 --> 00:47:46,092
There's a cage, but it's never
locked, is it, Plank?

790
00:47:46,188 --> 00:47:49,066
- Never.
- You don't wanna be ....

791
00:47:49,257 --> 00:47:52,327
All right, once he's got himself set,
he gets the rest of us in.

792
00:47:52,711 --> 00:47:56,356
Now we'll get nasty with a couple of'em,
shit 'em up, ok, or whatever.

793
00:47:56,643 --> 00:47:58,754
Now these wankers shouldn't
give us any problems.

794
00:47:58,946 --> 00:48:01,919
Like any cowboys - there'll
be a few tools lying around.

795
00:48:02,207 --> 00:48:05,756
When the job's done, we come
straight back here and unload.

796
00:48:06,140 --> 00:48:08,250
And Robert's
your father's brother.

797
00:48:08,922 --> 00:48:10,360
Everyone savvy?

798
00:48:10,552 --> 00:48:12,471
Sweet.

799
00:48:12,758 --> 00:48:14,581
Have a look at these.

800
00:48:15,540 --> 00:48:18,418
And what are we supposed
to do with these?

801
00:48:19,665 --> 00:48:21,583
Put them on your head, stupid.

802
00:48:21,583 --> 00:48:23,502
Christ!

803
00:48:23,885 --> 00:48:26,284
If you think I'm gonna
turn up there clean-shaven,

804
00:48:26,284 --> 00:48:29,065
and greet them with a grin on my face,
you've got another think coming.

805
00:48:29,449 --> 00:48:31,080
Now these fellas - they're your neighbours.

806
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:35,012
I thought it might be a good
idea to disguise ourselves a little.

807
00:48:35,396 --> 00:48:39,041
Right...er, yeah, good thinking,
Soap. Well done.

808
00:48:39,713 --> 00:48:41,343
I brought weapons as well.

809
00:48:41,535 --> 00:48:43,645
Weapons?
What do you mean weapons?

810
00:48:46,044 --> 00:48:47,003
These.

811
00:48:47,578 --> 00:48:49,305
Jesus!

812
00:48:49,689 --> 00:48:51,799
Let's keep 'em covered up.

813
00:48:53,142 --> 00:48:55,252
Couldn't you get
anything a bit bigger?

814
00:48:56,499 --> 00:48:58,993
What, like that?

815
00:48:59,473 --> 00:49:00,624
What d'you think?

816
00:49:02,063 --> 00:49:04,557
I think you need help.

817
00:49:04,940 --> 00:49:07,434
Bar steward, can we have
a coupla drinks, please.

818
00:49:07,722 --> 00:49:09,353
Have you seen your dad?

819
00:49:09,640 --> 00:49:11,943
Hatchet sent
one of his men round.

820
00:49:12,326 --> 00:49:13,957
Oh, shit. When?

821
00:49:15,684 --> 00:49:17,698
Crazy.

822
00:49:28,345 --> 00:49:30,743
Where'd you get these,
a fucking museum?

823
00:49:30,935 --> 00:49:33,046
Nick the Greek.

824
00:49:34,388 --> 00:49:35,827
How much did you part with?

825
00:49:36,019 --> 00:49:37,362
700 for the pair.

826
00:49:37,554 --> 00:49:39,185
Drachmas, I hope.

827
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:41,966
I'd feel safer
with a chicken drumstick.

828
00:49:42,062 --> 00:49:44,844
These are gonna do
more harm than good.

829
00:49:46,475 --> 00:49:49,161
Jesus, Tom. Do these work?

830
00:49:49,256 --> 00:49:51,846
I don't know. Look nice though, don't they ?
I rather like 'em.

831
00:49:51,942 --> 00:49:53,957
Oh, that's top of the list of priorities,
is that it?

832
00:49:54,053 --> 00:49:58,081
Ladies, back to more important
issues, if you don't mind.

833
00:49:58,273 --> 00:50:02,206
We've only got two real guns -
apparently that's what they are.

834
00:50:02,398 --> 00:50:04,412
So we find a good place
to hide next door.

835
00:50:04,604 --> 00:50:07,482
We wait till it sounds out the right
time, then we, jack-in-the-box,

836
00:50:07,482 --> 00:50:11,127
Iook nasty and stuff, cocoon 'em
in gaffer tape, nick their van,

837
00:50:11,319 --> 00:50:14,772
swap the gear into the new van
and bring it all back here.

838
00:50:14,964 --> 00:50:17,362
As long as we're all out
of our hiding places quickly,

839
00:50:17,362 --> 00:50:19,280
it's the last thing
they're gonna expect.

840
00:50:19,952 --> 00:50:23,789
Oh, and if Tom or anyone else for that matter
feels like giving 'em a bit of a kicking,

841
00:50:23,980 --> 00:50:25,899
I'm sure it won't do any harm.

842
00:50:26,378 --> 00:50:29,544
Yeah, little bit of pain
never hurt anybody.

843
00:50:29,832 --> 00:50:31,750
If you know what I mean.

844
00:50:32,134 --> 00:50:35,299
Also, I think knives
are a good idea.

845
00:50:35,683 --> 00:50:38,081
Big, fuck-off shiny ones.

846
00:50:38,465 --> 00:50:41,055
Ones that look like
they could skin a crocodile.

847
00:50:41,246 --> 00:50:43,932
Knives are good because
they don't make any noise.

848
00:50:44,220 --> 00:50:47,385
And the less noise they make, the
more likely we are to use 'em.

849
00:50:47,865 --> 00:50:49,879
Shit 'em right up.

850
00:50:50,071 --> 00:50:52,278
Makes it look
like we're serious.

851
00:50:52,661 --> 00:50:56,018
Guns for show,
knives for a pro.

852
00:50:56,786 --> 00:50:59,951
Soap, is there something
we should know about you?

853
00:51:00,239 --> 00:51:04,076
I'm not sure what's more
worrying, the job or your past?

854
00:51:07,050 --> 00:51:09,831
Come on, girls.

855
00:51:21,438 --> 00:51:23,836
Where the fuck are they going?
Shift a piano?

856
00:51:23,932 --> 00:51:26,042
I thought this was meant
to be a robbery.

857
00:51:26,426 --> 00:51:28,536
Where'd they get those outfits?

858
00:51:28,824 --> 00:51:30,742
Not a bad idea that.

859
00:51:31,318 --> 00:51:33,236
All right, it's Plank.
Is Willie there?

860
00:51:33,716 --> 00:51:36,018
No, I'm afraid he's not.
He's out at the moment.

861
00:51:36,018 --> 00:51:37,457
Perhaps you can help.

862
00:51:37,937 --> 00:51:40,622
Perhaps I can't, Plank,
if you know what I mean.

863
00:51:41,006 --> 00:51:44,363
Look, if you could just open the door so
I could talk without shouting.

864
00:51:44,651 --> 00:51:46,570
I can't help you, Plank.

865
00:51:46,570 --> 00:51:49,351
I think you'll find
it's in your interest.

866
00:51:49,735 --> 00:51:50,790
Hold on, OK?

867
00:51:51,174 --> 00:51:54,531
Look, Willie, it's Plank outside for you.
He says it's in our interest.

868
00:51:54,915 --> 00:51:57,697
Listen, I don't care if it's
King-fucking-Kong,

869
00:51:57,888 --> 00:52:00,095
he's not coming in here,
not today.

870
00:52:00,095 --> 00:52:03,644
Hold on. We are in business
and...correct me if I'm wrong, but --

871
00:52:04,219 --> 00:52:05,370
that is business.

872
00:52:05,466 --> 00:52:08,824
Corrected. That's a walking
accident that we can do without.

873
00:52:09,015 --> 00:52:12,661
Jesus. He's OK... He knows
only to buy weights now.

874
00:52:12,756 --> 00:52:15,346
We're looking at at least
a couple of thou'.

875
00:52:15,634 --> 00:52:17,073
What do you think, Winston?

876
00:52:18,704 --> 00:52:21,102
Willie, this is
the last time. All right?

877
00:52:21,773 --> 00:52:23,308
But you and the money
are going out the back.

878
00:52:23,404 --> 00:52:24,939
If he knows you're here,
he'll be all day.

879
00:52:25,226 --> 00:52:26,857
And just clear this shit up!

880
00:52:28,104 --> 00:52:30,502
- What, now?
- Yes! Now!

881
00:52:30,790 --> 00:52:32,708
Just get rid of him quick.

882
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:34,915
All right. Just coming.

883
00:52:38,560 --> 00:52:39,998
What the fuck is he doing?

884
00:52:43,068 --> 00:52:46,233
Come on, I can't wait
out here all day!

885
00:52:46,713 --> 00:52:48,823
All right. Just coming.

886
00:52:53,140 --> 00:52:55,154
I thought you was gonna
leave me out there all day.

887
00:52:55,346 --> 00:52:57,169
I didn't know you were
a removals man, Plank.

888
00:52:57,360 --> 00:53:00,910
Lives and learns, don't ya?
Keep the gates locked now here?

889
00:53:01,197 --> 00:53:04,171
Ya, sorry. Gotta
do business like this now.

890
00:53:04,171 --> 00:53:05,898
Can't be too careful these days.

891
00:53:06,089 --> 00:53:07,049
I know.

892
00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:10,981
Shut it! You say a fucking word, the right ear goes,
another one - and your left!

893
00:53:10,981 --> 00:53:13,284
- What are you doing, Plank?
- What do you think I'm doing?

894
00:53:13,284 --> 00:53:15,298
Hang on, what are you doing?

895
00:53:15,586 --> 00:53:18,463
Unlock the gate!
Oi! I say unlock the fucking gate!

896
00:53:18,847 --> 00:53:21,629
That's it. Go, go, go!
Fucking move!

897
00:53:25,370 --> 00:53:26,521
What the fuck's going on?

898
00:53:26,521 --> 00:53:28,535
Just hang on, I've got the keys.

899
00:53:28,823 --> 00:53:31,988
The gate's locked! I thought they weren't gonna
let the fucking gate locked.

900
00:53:32,084 --> 00:53:33,139
What've you done to Fauntleroy?

901
00:53:33,139 --> 00:53:35,058
I didn't touch him.
He just passed out.

902
00:53:35,346 --> 00:53:38,703
Don't you stand there. Get the fucking door shut!
D'you want the world to see this?

903
00:53:41,197 --> 00:53:43,115
What's going on down there?

904
00:53:45,705 --> 00:53:46,569
Shit!

905
00:53:52,228 --> 00:53:55,969
Charles, get the rifle out.

906
00:53:56,832 --> 00:53:58,271
We're being fucked.

907
00:53:58,463 --> 00:53:59,422
It must be this one.

908
00:53:59,710 --> 00:54:02,588
Hold that gun. Plank, give me the keys.
Give me the keys, Plank.

909
00:54:02,780 --> 00:54:05,178
Don't point that at my bollocks!
Point it in there!

910
00:54:05,465 --> 00:54:08,535
Planks of wood. I'm working
with fucking planks of wood.

911
00:54:08,727 --> 00:54:09,590
Shit !

912
00:54:11,508 --> 00:54:12,564
What the fuck is that?

913
00:54:13,523 --> 00:54:15,249
- What the fuck's that?
- IT'S ME BREN GUN!

914
00:54:15,345 --> 00:54:18,511
Don't you think you could've brought something
a little bit more practical?

915
00:54:19,278 --> 00:54:22,060
Don't none of you slags move.
I'll kill the fucking lot of you!

916
00:54:22,156 --> 00:54:24,362
Who you gonna kill, Plank?
There's no one fuckin' there?

917
00:54:27,911 --> 00:54:30,117
Aaagh! They fucking shot me!

918
00:54:30,309 --> 00:54:32,324
Well, shoot 'em back.

919
00:54:34,338 --> 00:54:36,928
Jesus, Plank! Couldn't you get
smokeless cartidges?

920
00:54:37,024 --> 00:54:38,463
I can't see a bloody thing !

921
00:54:38,750 --> 00:54:41,340
Aaagh! Shit, I've been shot.

922
00:54:41,436 --> 00:54:44,122
I don't fucking believe this.
Could everyone stop getting shot?

923
00:54:44,506 --> 00:54:47,863
John, sit down and patch
yourself up, you tart!

924
00:54:47,863 --> 00:54:49,686
It's a fucking air rifle!

925
00:54:56,592 --> 00:54:58,798
- What the fuck was that?
- Well, that was the bren gun.

926
00:54:58,894 --> 00:55:01,580
You fire that gun again, you're a dead man.
Understand? Dead!

927
00:55:01,772 --> 00:55:04,458
- No ifs, no buts, you're a fucking dead man!
- All right, all right!

928
00:55:04,458 --> 00:55:06,856
I've got bollock ache with this.
Where's my fucking gun?

929
00:55:11,844 --> 00:55:16,928
All right. Now I've got your attention.
Firstly, I'm gonna blow his toes off.

930
00:55:19,134 --> 00:55:20,381
There go his toes.

931
00:55:20,860 --> 00:55:23,258
Now if you want me out of here,
in five minutes flat,

932
00:55:23,546 --> 00:55:26,616
open the fucking gate
'cause I'm gonna blow his leg off!

933
00:55:28,151 --> 00:55:30,357
They're gonna fucking kill us
if we do, man.

934
00:55:30,932 --> 00:55:33,330
Poor J'll certainly get it
if we don't. He's serious.

935
00:55:33,618 --> 00:55:35,728
I'm losing patience.
Hurry up, girls!

936
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:39,182
It's all right, all fucking right!

937
00:55:39,949 --> 00:55:42,347
Willie, he doesn't know
you're here..., just .....

938
00:55:43,594 --> 00:55:46,472
Sort something out.

939
00:55:56,640 --> 00:55:59,229
And all your friends,
there's a good lad.

940
00:55:59,997 --> 00:56:02,874
- There's only three of us here.
- I don't believe you.

941
00:56:03,162 --> 00:56:07,287
- Fuck, I'm gonna blow his leg off.
- I mean it. There's only three of us!

942
00:56:07,767 --> 00:56:11,220
- Plank?
- Yeah, one of 'em's out.

943
00:56:14,577 --> 00:56:16,879
Now open the gate.

944
00:56:38,558 --> 00:56:40,860
Up, up, up, there's a good lad.

945
00:56:58,222 --> 00:57:00,620
John, get them tied up.
Plank, where's the money?

946
00:57:00,716 --> 00:57:03,497
There, in those shoe-boxes.

947
00:57:20,572 --> 00:57:22,682
- Where?
- Out the back.

948
00:57:23,162 --> 00:57:24,600
- And the weed?
- Out the back.

949
00:57:25,080 --> 00:57:26,903
- Point.
- With what?

950
00:57:27,190 --> 00:57:29,972
- Your fucking hands, now!
- I'm tied up.

951
00:57:30,356 --> 00:57:31,795
Well, nod your head or something!

952
00:57:32,946 --> 00:57:33,905
Check it out.

953
00:57:34,576 --> 00:57:37,262
Plank, get Paul out that van lively.

954
00:57:52,034 --> 00:57:53,185
Knife.

955
00:57:57,886 --> 00:58:00,763
I'm gonna cut him.
Make sure he knows he's dead.

956
00:58:01,147 --> 00:58:02,010
How you doing, Mick?

957
00:58:01,722 --> 00:58:05,176
How d'you think I'm doing?
He's fucking nearly chopped my arm off.

958
00:58:13,521 --> 00:58:15,823
Jesus Christ.

959
00:58:20,715 --> 00:58:21,962
Gordon Bennett.

960
00:58:22,250 --> 00:58:23,881
What the fuck's
been going on here?

961
00:58:24,072 --> 00:58:27,909
Shut up, you idiot.
It's Hanukkah.

962
00:58:28,773 --> 00:58:29,732
Don't just stand there.

963
00:58:30,020 --> 00:58:31,746
Look at the bags, can you fit it all in?

964
00:58:32,322 --> 00:58:36,638
There's a lot...l can't
get Epping Forest in my van.

965
00:58:37,693 --> 00:58:40,571
'Can't'. I don't hear 'can't'.
Bollocks to 'can't'.

966
00:58:40,667 --> 00:58:43,736
You'll fit it all in
if you have to make two trips.

967
00:58:48,341 --> 00:58:49,876
Bollocks!

968
00:58:51,314 --> 00:58:54,576
You got a ticket already. Now if you
don't move it, we will move it for you.

969
00:58:54,672 --> 00:58:56,878
- I'll only be a minute.
- You've already been 15.

970
00:58:57,262 --> 00:59:00,715
- Look, come and have a look.
- At what exactly?

971
00:59:01,098 --> 00:59:03,784
- Well, the van's half full.
- So?

972
00:59:03,976 --> 00:59:07,717
So, all I've got to do
is fill it up, put you in it...

973
00:59:07,909 --> 00:59:08,868
What?

974
00:59:12,130 --> 00:59:13,760
..and I'm off.

975
00:59:21,530 --> 00:59:23,544
Do you think you can carry
more than one bag this time?

976
00:59:23,736 --> 00:59:25,846
- I can't. My neck, Dog.

977
00:59:26,614 --> 00:59:29,204
- How many more bags ?
- Just a couple.

978
00:59:30,067 --> 00:59:32,561
Mick, you dead yet?

979
00:59:33,616 --> 00:59:37,741
I'll be all right. Once I've
dealt with that lanky prick.

980
00:59:38,316 --> 00:59:40,043
Do it quietly.

981
00:59:43,304 --> 00:59:45,415
It's time to say "Goodnight, nurse".

982
01:00:27,141 --> 01:00:29,251
Where the fuck
did she come from?

983
01:00:35,678 --> 01:00:38,556
That is it. Tie her up.
We're out of here.

984
01:00:41,241 --> 01:00:44,887
Not like that,
you idiot. Give it us here.

985
01:01:07,908 --> 01:01:09,347
What you doing, Ed?

986
01:01:10,114 --> 01:01:10,786
D'you want one?

987
01:01:11,265 --> 01:01:13,759
No, I fucking don't.
You cannot make a cup of tea, Edward.

988
01:01:14,047 --> 01:01:17,212
The entire British Empire
was built on cups of tea.

989
01:01:17,308 --> 01:01:18,843
Yeah, and look what happened to that.

990
01:01:18,939 --> 01:01:22,104
And if you think I'm going to war
without one, mate, you're mistaken.

991
01:01:22,296 --> 01:01:23,831
Going to war with what?

992
01:01:24,215 --> 01:01:27,668
Have you forgotten
those guns, you dozy prat?

993
01:01:47,524 --> 01:01:49,922
You won't get away with this.

994
01:01:51,840 --> 01:01:54,622
- Paul, what's that?
- It's a traffic warden.

995
01:01:54,910 --> 01:01:57,692
I can see it's a fuckin' traffic warden,
what's he doing in the back of the van?

996
01:01:57,979 --> 01:01:59,322
He was gonna call the cozzers.

997
01:02:01,049 --> 01:02:04,502
Fair enough -
we'll deal with him later.

998
01:02:06,612 --> 01:02:08,243
How we doing, Tom?

999
01:02:08,531 --> 01:02:09,874
Right as rain.

1000
01:02:10,258 --> 01:02:12,176
I'm just gonna take care of the cabs.

1001
01:02:12,176 --> 01:02:14,094
Keep us posted.

1002
01:02:17,740 --> 01:02:20,042
All right, mate, do you do airports?

1003
01:02:23,111 --> 01:02:24,454
Where the hell are we gonna hide?

1004
01:02:27,620 --> 01:02:29,826
Don't complicate things.
Just hide.

1005
01:02:42,967 --> 01:02:44,118
We're on.

1006
01:03:00,425 --> 01:03:01,864
They weigh a pound or two!

1007
01:03:02,056 --> 01:03:03,782
Shut up and back up!

1008
01:03:05,797 --> 01:03:08,099
Spin round, big boy.

1009
01:03:11,072 --> 01:03:12,032
Fuck!

1010
01:03:12,415 --> 01:03:15,101
Stay down. Stay down!

1011
01:03:21,048 --> 01:03:23,734
Tie 'em up. Tape 'em up.
Hands and face.

1012
01:03:24,118 --> 01:03:25,940
On the floor!

1013
01:03:26,132 --> 01:03:28,243
Bend over the fucking desk.

1014
01:03:33,422 --> 01:03:36,492
Keys. I want keys, now.

1015
01:03:37,931 --> 01:03:39,178
I'll find ya.

1016
01:03:39,753 --> 01:03:41,672
'Course you will, sweetheart.

1017
01:03:41,768 --> 01:03:43,206
I'll find ya.

1018
01:03:43,398 --> 01:03:46,276
What d'you think this is?
Fucking hide-and-seek?

1019
01:03:46,756 --> 01:03:48,866
That one. Search that one.

1020
01:03:58,362 --> 01:04:01,719
Right, I'll see you in the van,
when you've finished with handsome here.

1021
01:04:19,273 --> 01:04:21,192
Jesus. That wasn't
too bad, was it?

1022
01:04:26,084 --> 01:04:28,961
When the bottle in my arse has
contracted, I'll let you know.

1023
01:04:29,441 --> 01:04:32,511
Bacon, see what we've got.

1024
01:04:32,702 --> 01:04:34,429
Let's have a butchers, ey?

1025
01:04:39,225 --> 01:04:41,048
We've hit the jackpot, lads.

1026
01:04:42,295 --> 01:04:44,980
We've got God knows how much
of this stinking weed.

1027
01:04:45,940 --> 01:04:48,146
A shitload of cash.

1028
01:04:49,968 --> 01:04:51,503
And a traffic warden.

1029
01:04:51,695 --> 01:04:52,558
What?

1030
01:04:55,148 --> 01:04:57,163
Jesus, Ed.
We got a traffic warden.

1031
01:04:58,793 --> 01:05:00,616
I think he's still alive.

1032
01:05:01,095 --> 01:05:03,398
He's got claret
coming out of him somewhere.

1033
01:05:04,357 --> 01:05:05,604
What did they want
with a traffic warden?

1034
01:05:05,604 --> 01:05:07,330
I don't know.
I don't think we need him.

1035
01:05:07,522 --> 01:05:09,537
Knock him out and dump him
at the lights.

1036
01:05:09,728 --> 01:05:11,647
Knock him out? What d'you mean,
knock him out? Knock him out with what?

1037
01:05:11,839 --> 01:05:14,141
I don't know! Use your imagination.

1038
01:05:19,513 --> 01:05:21,527
Don't touch him up.
Knock him out.

1039
01:05:21,719 --> 01:05:22,966
I'll knock you out in a minute!

1040
01:05:23,062 --> 01:05:25,843
Look, you wanna knock him out,
you knock him out.

1041
01:05:27,186 --> 01:05:29,297
I fucking hate traffic wardens.

1042
01:05:40,040 --> 01:05:43,205
It's about time you gave my
young friends a visit, Chris.

1043
01:05:46,850 --> 01:05:49,057
Tomorrow's the day
and mum's the word.

1044
01:05:49,153 --> 01:05:50,687
Now I can't have that,
can l, Baz?

1045
01:05:50,783 --> 01:05:52,510
No, Harry, you can't.

1046
01:05:52,606 --> 01:05:54,716
I mean it's a liberty.

1047
01:05:55,484 --> 01:05:57,977
And I can't have a liberty taken,
can l, Chris?

1048
01:05:58,265 --> 01:05:59,800
No, Harry, you can't.

1049
01:06:00,855 --> 01:06:03,925
I mean, it's enough
to give me the arsehole.

1050
01:06:05,172 --> 01:06:07,282
And I can't have the arsehole,
can l, boys?

1051
01:06:07,378 --> 01:06:09,968
No, Harry, you can't.

1052
01:06:15,915 --> 01:06:18,409
All right, that's it.
We're done.

1053
01:06:19,464 --> 01:06:20,327
We're off.

1054
01:06:20,327 --> 01:06:22,917
Here, Ed, are you sure it's a good
idea taking this back to yours?

1055
01:06:23,013 --> 01:06:25,219
Why, it's the only place we can take it,
and the last place they're gonna look.

1056
01:06:25,315 --> 01:06:28,097
Anyway, fuck it. The battle
is over and the war is won.

1057
01:06:28,193 --> 01:06:32,510
Now, Tom, you take this to Nick the
Bubble and we get rid of it quick.

1058
01:06:45,267 --> 01:06:48,049
This skunk
is as good as it gets.

1059
01:06:50,351 --> 01:06:53,996
All right.
We'll take it. Half price.

1060
01:06:55,339 --> 01:06:56,874
I don't think he'll like that.

1061
01:06:56,970 --> 01:07:00,039
And you said three five a key.
And... and you know that's a good price.

1062
01:07:00,327 --> 01:07:02,054
That was yesterday I said three and a half.

1063
01:07:02,150 --> 01:07:04,260
And now it's today
if I'm not mistaken.

1064
01:07:04,644 --> 01:07:07,617
We'll take it tomorrow.
Half price.

1065
01:07:08,097 --> 01:07:10,783
If he wants to get rid of it
quick, he'll have to take it.

1066
01:07:10,879 --> 01:07:15,675
Now look, I've got a race coming up in a minute,
so if you'd just be kind enough to...

1067
01:07:23,444 --> 01:07:24,308
Lenny,

1068
01:07:24,404 --> 01:07:27,089
take that round to Snow White
and the three little chemists.

1069
01:07:27,185 --> 01:07:29,104
They should have
a gander of that.

1070
01:07:29,104 --> 01:07:31,790
I want a second opinion.

1071
01:07:36,010 --> 01:07:37,833
Hang on a minute, Nathan,
something stinks.

1072
01:07:37,929 --> 01:07:40,039
Yeah, your fucking aftershave.

1073
01:07:40,231 --> 01:07:41,957
Fuck you, funny man.

1074
01:07:43,013 --> 01:07:44,931
For God's sake, help me.

1075
01:07:45,027 --> 01:07:48,864
I'm in pain.
I'm in so much pain, Jesus!

1076
01:07:48,864 --> 01:07:50,111
Go in slowly, Nathan.

1077
01:07:50,399 --> 01:07:52,413
Fuck you, funny man.
You go first.

1078
01:07:52,509 --> 01:07:54,427
Just get the fuck in there, will you ?

1079
01:07:54,619 --> 01:07:57,689
I want this house searched for bugs,
I mean I want it stripped.

1080
01:07:57,881 --> 01:08:01,142
Where is the poin in that ?
Even if there was a bug,
they'd have taken it with 'em.

1081
01:08:01,238 --> 01:08:03,348
It's a bit late
for you to start thinking, John.

1082
01:08:03,540 --> 01:08:05,746
If it's a possibility,
that's good enough for me.

1083
01:08:06,130 --> 01:08:09,967
I want you to strip this place.
I want every slag this side of Ceylon
pulled in.

1084
01:08:09,967 --> 01:08:12,749
And tortured...badly.

1085
01:08:12,940 --> 01:08:14,475
I want to know
who's responsible for this,

1086
01:08:14,571 --> 01:08:16,969
otherwise I'm gonna hold
you all responsible.

1087
01:08:24,739 --> 01:08:26,274
Not a bad day.

1088
01:08:27,617 --> 01:08:30,015
That pile takes care of Harry.

1089
01:08:31,453 --> 01:08:32,796
What's left over?

1090
01:08:32,796 --> 01:08:34,715
Give me half a chance
to count it.

1091
01:08:36,250 --> 01:08:38,264
What about this gear, then, ey?

1092
01:08:44,691 --> 01:08:46,321
Oh, what, you want
a toke on that?

1093
01:08:46,705 --> 01:08:48,720
No. I don't think I want any
of that horrible shit.

1094
01:08:49,007 --> 01:08:51,501
Can we lock up
and get drunk now, please?

1095
01:08:53,420 --> 01:08:56,969
We shot one of them...
in the...er, throat.

1096
01:08:57,161 --> 01:08:58,024
What d'you want, a medal?

1097
01:08:58,216 --> 01:09:01,669
I'll shoot you in the fuckin throat
if I don't get my ganja back.

1098
01:09:03,012 --> 01:09:05,698
The one you shot.
Is he still in there now?

1099
01:09:05,890 --> 01:09:07,328
No, it was another one.

1100
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:10,398
That's more like it.
Where is he?

1101
01:09:11,261 --> 01:09:13,084
Well, they...they
took him with them.

1102
01:09:13,947 --> 01:09:15,866
He's still, still alive.

1103
01:09:16,057 --> 01:09:19,415
What did you shoot him with?
An air gun?

1104
01:09:23,827 --> 01:09:28,719
Look, we grow weed.
We're not mercenaries.

1105
01:09:29,295 --> 01:09:31,309
You don't say.

1106
01:09:31,405 --> 01:09:34,762
Who could it be?
Where do we start, Rory?

1107
01:09:34,954 --> 01:09:36,009
Mr Breaker.

1108
01:09:36,201 --> 01:09:40,038
Today my name is Mr Breaker.

1109
01:09:40,134 --> 01:09:42,244
You think this
is a coincidence?

1110
01:09:42,436 --> 01:09:44,163
This white shite
steals my things

1111
01:09:44,163 --> 01:09:46,177
and thinks that he can
sell it back to me!

1112
01:09:46,177 --> 01:09:48,383
He's got less brains
than you, Lenny!

1113
01:09:49,438 --> 01:09:51,165
Get Nick - the greasy wop

1114
01:09:51,261 --> 01:09:55,386
shistos pezavengy gammore
Greek bastard round here now,

1115
01:09:55,386 --> 01:09:58,743
if he's still stupid enough
to be on this planet.

1116
01:10:23,107 --> 01:10:25,601
# Come with me,
I'll fill you with desire

1117
01:10:26,081 --> 01:10:30,014
# Take my hand and we'll walk
this land together ##

1118
01:11:27,663 --> 01:11:30,541
Your stupidity might be
your one saving grace.

1119
01:11:30,733 --> 01:11:31,692
Uuh?

1120
01:11:31,980 --> 01:11:33,898
Don't uuh me, Greek boy.

1121
01:11:33,898 --> 01:11:36,968
How is it your fucking stupid,
soon-to-be-dead friends

1122
01:11:36,968 --> 01:11:39,749
thought that they might be able
to steal my cannabis

1123
01:11:39,749 --> 01:11:41,668
and then sell it back to me?

1124
01:11:41,668 --> 01:11:43,874
Is this a declaration of war?

1125
01:11:43,874 --> 01:11:46,752
Is this some white cunt's joke
that black cunts don't get?

1126
01:11:47,135 --> 01:11:50,301
'Cause I'm not fucking laughing,
Ni-ko-las!

1127
01:11:52,219 --> 01:11:54,042
I know you couldn't
have known my position,

1128
01:11:54,138 --> 01:11:56,632
'cause you're not that stupid
that if you did,

1129
01:11:56,823 --> 01:11:58,934
you wouldn't have turned up here
scratching your arse,

1130
01:11:59,030 --> 01:12:03,634
with that "what's going on here" look
slapped all over your Chevy Chase.

1131
01:12:04,977 --> 01:12:08,718
But what you do know
is where these people live.

1132
01:12:14,665 --> 01:12:16,967
If you hold back anything,
I'll kill you.

1133
01:12:17,543 --> 01:12:20,900
If you bend the truth, or I think
you are bending the truth, I'll kill you.

1134
01:12:21,284 --> 01:12:23,202
If you forget anything,
I'll kill you.

1135
01:12:23,298 --> 01:12:27,423
In fact, you're gonna have to work
very hard to stay alive, Nick.

1136
01:12:27,806 --> 01:12:30,109
Now do you understand
everything I've said?

1137
01:12:31,068 --> 01:12:34,617
Because if you don't,
I'll kill you.

1138
01:12:34,809 --> 01:12:40,276
Now, Mr Bubble and Squeak...
you may enlighten me.

1139
01:12:43,634 --> 01:12:45,360
So we've got a bit
of a problem, don't we?

1140
01:12:45,936 --> 01:12:47,662
Er, well...yeah, yeah, we do.

1141
01:12:47,758 --> 01:12:51,403
Yea, yeah, we do. In fact, this is a little bit more
than looking a bit of a problem, isn't it ?

1142
01:12:51,403 --> 01:12:54,473
On the scale of things, you could say it's the
Mount fucking Everest of problems!

1143
01:12:54,473 --> 01:12:57,255
And the reason it's such a
mon-fucking-struosity of a problem is...

1144
01:12:57,255 --> 01:13:00,228
you don't have the first idea
who did this to us, have you?

1145
01:13:00,228 --> 01:13:02,818
Dog, we've... we've been up all night.
It's no one from round here.

1146
01:13:02,914 --> 01:13:04,449
We've had 'em all lined up
against the wall.

1147
01:13:04,737 --> 01:13:06,559
If it was a toerag
from round the manor, we'd know.

1148
01:13:06,559 --> 01:13:09,820
- We'd know.
- You'd know? You'd fucking know?

1149
01:13:09,916 --> 01:13:12,506
You wouldn't know if it was
the next door fucking neighbours!

1150
01:13:12,506 --> 01:13:13,945
Now get out there and find them!

1151
01:13:13,945 --> 01:13:18,645
I'm sick of the fucking sight of you!
Get out of the fucking sight!
You look shit!

1152
01:13:29,485 --> 01:13:33,226
"Scarface" -
I've watched "Scarface".

1153
01:13:33,801 --> 01:13:37,254
If you want to know how to do
a drug deal, you watch "Scarface".

1154
01:13:39,365 --> 01:13:41,187
That really inspires confidence.

1155
01:13:41,379 --> 01:13:44,161
- This guy, Rory Breaker...
- Rory Breaker ?

1156
01:13:44,544 --> 01:13:46,463
The psychotic black dwarf with an afro?

1157
01:13:46,655 --> 01:13:47,902
That'll be the same man, yes.

1158
01:13:48,094 --> 01:13:50,683
I've heard of him -
he's a fucking lunatic.

1159
01:13:50,779 --> 01:13:53,273
Well, he can afford to do the deal
at the price we're selling.

1160
01:13:53,273 --> 01:13:54,520
It's not worth him
giving us any trouble.

1161
01:13:54,616 --> 01:13:57,302
Cause he knows we'll be a pain
in the arse. And who needs a pain in the arse?

1162
01:13:57,302 --> 01:13:59,221
I'd take a pain in the arse
for half a million quid.

1163
01:13:59,604 --> 01:14:01,139
You'd take a pain
in the arse for air miles.

1164
01:14:01,523 --> 01:14:03,249
Tom, the fatter you get,
the sadder you get.

1165
01:14:03,249 --> 01:14:05,072
Will you two stop flirting
for a minute?

1166
01:14:05,360 --> 01:14:09,580
After we pay Hatchet,
this deal puts us up...

1167
01:14:09,964 --> 01:14:12,650
nearly 200,000 pounds each.

1168
01:14:13,417 --> 01:14:16,199
That's not bad for a morning's work,
I think you'll agree.

1169
01:14:26,654 --> 01:14:28,093
So they had the cash.

1170
01:14:28,285 --> 01:14:29,148
And the puff.

1171
01:14:29,244 --> 01:14:32,218
Cheeky bastards. Count it.

1172
01:14:32,314 --> 01:14:34,232
Shit, Dog. There's a lot.

1173
01:14:34,328 --> 01:14:36,630
Do you want to do it next door?

1174
01:14:37,110 --> 01:14:38,165
We're not going next door

1175
01:14:38,165 --> 01:14:40,659
'til we've flayed
them dead men walking.

1176
01:14:41,235 --> 01:14:42,386
We'll count it upstairs.

1177
01:14:42,482 --> 01:14:45,071
I don't want them to see you
fingering the money when
they walk through the door...

1178
01:14:45,647 --> 01:14:46,894
Dog, look...

1179
01:14:48,237 --> 01:14:51,498
Give it us here...dozy bastard.

1180
01:14:53,992 --> 01:14:56,294
Check your guns.
Get yourselves well hid.

1181
01:14:56,486 --> 01:15:00,323
You wait till they get right inside
the door, then you give it to'em.

1182
01:15:00,803 --> 01:15:04,160
Give me them shooters,
you can use your own.

1183
01:15:14,232 --> 01:15:14,999
Yeah.

1184
01:15:15,095 --> 01:15:16,822
That's no way
to answer the phone.

1185
01:15:16,918 --> 01:15:18,261
Is that you, Dean?

1186
01:15:18,357 --> 01:15:20,851
No, it's Lord fucking Lucan.
Who do you think it is?

1187
01:15:20,851 --> 01:15:22,002
What can I do for you?

1188
01:15:22,289 --> 01:15:24,783
You know those guns I sold you,
I need them back.

1189
01:15:25,071 --> 01:15:27,469
Not likely I'm afraid. I don't think
I'll be seeing them again.

1190
01:15:27,949 --> 01:15:29,580
Look, I've got the money
to pay for them.

1191
01:15:29,867 --> 01:15:32,361
I'm sure you do.
But don't think you understand.

1192
01:15:32,457 --> 01:15:34,759
I ain't gonna be seeing them
or the guns again.

1193
01:15:35,239 --> 01:15:36,294
We can't get them.

1194
01:15:36,582 --> 01:15:38,117
If we can't get them,
we can't get them.

1195
01:15:38,596 --> 01:15:40,515
Well, you'll have to fucking get them.

1196
01:15:40,515 --> 01:15:43,009
We made a fucking deal for
everything inside the cabinet.

1197
01:15:43,009 --> 01:15:46,174
Inside, out-fucking-side -
I don't give a shit.

1198
01:15:46,270 --> 01:15:49,627
- You get those guns because if you don't...
- Oh yeah, Bazza, or what ?

1199
01:15:49,627 --> 01:15:51,546
Have you heard
of Harry Lonsdale?

1200
01:15:51,834 --> 01:15:55,191
Otherwise known as "Hack You
Up With an Hatchet Harry"?

1201
01:15:55,287 --> 01:15:57,301
Well, this is...

1202
01:15:57,589 --> 01:16:00,179
James Bond, need-to-know time.

1203
01:16:00,275 --> 01:16:04,208
When you dance with the devil,
you wait for the song to stop.

1204
01:16:04,399 --> 01:16:06,126
Know what I mean?

1205
01:16:10,538 --> 01:16:13,704
I mean find 'em,
torture 'em and kill 'em.

1206
01:16:13,896 --> 01:16:15,814
And bring back
what belongs to me.

1207
01:16:16,006 --> 01:16:20,514
Because if you don't,
your family's bang in trouble.

1208
01:16:21,569 --> 01:16:22,625
Who was that?

1209
01:16:23,104 --> 01:16:24,927
That was Harry Horrible Hatchet.

1210
01:16:25,023 --> 01:16:26,462
Jesus, I've heard of him.

1211
01:16:26,557 --> 01:16:29,627
Shit, they were
his fucking guns we sold.

1212
01:16:30,011 --> 01:16:31,258
We've got to find them.

1213
01:16:31,737 --> 01:16:35,766
Now no fucking about now, Nick.
Where can I find those guns?

1214
01:17:07,037 --> 01:17:09,051
Six black cocks
and a little white kitten

1215
01:17:09,051 --> 01:17:10,874
sitting on the side
of the road.

1216
01:17:13,751 --> 01:17:16,341
We're gonna do
a proper decoration job.

1217
01:17:16,821 --> 01:17:19,603
I want the grey skies
of London illuminated.

1218
01:17:20,370 --> 01:17:22,384
I want that house painted red.

1219
01:17:24,591 --> 01:17:27,756
All right, there's this brass
standing on the corner, right?

1220
01:17:27,756 --> 01:17:30,442
Dwarf walks up to her
carrying a suitcase...

1221
01:17:30,538 --> 01:17:32,648
Winston there
is gonna come along

1222
01:17:32,648 --> 01:17:34,471
and see if he recognises
any of them.

1223
01:17:35,142 --> 01:17:36,965
Now watch out for these fellas -

1224
01:17:37,732 --> 01:17:41,569
they've got a bit of an arsenal
and they don't mind using it.

1225
01:17:41,857 --> 01:17:44,159
...and I'm taking down her panties...

1226
01:17:45,981 --> 01:17:48,571
Now does everyone here know
what they got to do?

1227
01:17:48,571 --> 01:17:50,298
Yeah.

1228
01:18:57,252 --> 01:18:59,362
What the fuck is going on?

1229
01:19:41,280 --> 01:19:43,390
You got something here
for me, have you?

1230
01:19:44,925 --> 01:19:47,419
Come on, chop-chop.

1231
01:19:54,230 --> 01:19:56,148
Thank you very much.

1232
01:19:57,299 --> 01:20:00,273
- He's got the guns.Go ahead you get them.
- Why me?

1233
01:20:00,561 --> 01:20:01,999
You're supposed
to be the hard case...

1234
01:20:01,999 --> 01:20:04,685
You go get the guns!
I drive the car!

1235
01:20:10,057 --> 01:20:10,824
Good boy.

1236
01:20:10,920 --> 01:20:15,333
- Go get the fucking guns.
- I'm not going get the fucking guns!
YOU get the fucking guns!

1237
01:20:14,949 --> 01:20:17,155
You fucking big...

1238
01:20:20,512 --> 01:20:22,143
All right. Wrap them guns up.

1239
01:20:22,335 --> 01:20:23,582
Count the money.

1240
01:20:24,349 --> 01:20:25,692
Put your seat belt on.

1241
01:20:26,076 --> 01:20:30,105
Fucking guns, we've got to get the fucking
guns or we're dead!

1242
01:20:44,109 --> 01:20:46,891
..so I made sure I fucked
the one that was coughing.

1243
01:21:00,128 --> 01:21:03,869
Out of the car, you yuppy fucker!
Aaaaaaaagh !

1244
01:21:30,824 --> 01:21:32,358
He's the one
we shot in the neck.

1245
01:21:32,454 --> 01:21:35,332
Is that right, Mr Botanical?

1246
01:22:00,368 --> 01:22:02,478
Jesus!

1247
01:22:14,085 --> 01:22:17,250
I don't believe this.
What the fuck has happened here?

1248
01:22:17,538 --> 01:22:18,881
Jesus.

1249
01:22:20,607 --> 01:22:23,581
The money. The gear.

1250
01:22:34,612 --> 01:22:36,051
This is fucked.

1251
01:22:36,435 --> 01:22:38,929
No money. No weed.

1252
01:22:39,696 --> 01:22:42,382
It's all been replaced
by a pile of corpses.

1253
01:22:42,765 --> 01:22:45,931
All right. Don't panic.
Let's think about this.

1254
01:22:45,931 --> 01:22:48,809
No, fuck that,
you can think about it.

1255
01:22:48,904 --> 01:22:51,398
I'm panicking and I'm off.

1256
01:22:59,168 --> 01:23:01,087
How did you get your hands
on these, then?

1257
01:23:01,183 --> 01:23:02,334
The boys had 'em.

1258
01:23:02,525 --> 01:23:03,677
I know you like
these sort of things -

1259
01:23:03,772 --> 01:23:05,787
wondered if you wanted 'em.

1260
01:23:05,979 --> 01:23:07,993
Yeah, I'll have 'em.

1261
01:23:08,185 --> 01:23:11,350
- Was it hard getting the money?
- Not especially.

1262
01:23:12,597 --> 01:23:14,612
Upset a few characters, though.

1263
01:23:16,146 --> 01:23:17,106
Have you counted it?

1264
01:23:17,297 --> 01:23:19,120
Yeah, it's all there,
to the pound.

1265
01:23:19,312 --> 01:23:21,422
- And they were gonna pay?
- Looks like it.

1266
01:23:21,518 --> 01:23:24,300
But who knows?
The opportunity was there.

1267
01:23:24,396 --> 01:23:27,273
In my experience it's best
to take that opportunity -

1268
01:23:27,465 --> 01:23:29,288
if it's there.

1269
01:23:29,863 --> 01:23:31,686
Good work, Chris.

1270
01:23:38,592 --> 01:23:39,935
We've got to get those guns.

1271
01:23:40,127 --> 01:23:42,621
This is dangerous shit there.
We don't even know who lives there.

1272
01:23:42,717 --> 01:23:44,539
Listen, I don't care who lives there!

1273
01:23:44,539 --> 01:23:48,089
All's I know is that it's preferable
to death by Hatchet.

1274
01:23:48,089 --> 01:23:50,966
Fair enough. Let's go.

1275
01:24:13,508 --> 01:24:15,427
I don't think
it's the right move.

1276
01:24:16,194 --> 01:24:17,057
It's either that

1277
01:24:17,249 --> 01:24:20,606
the old boy's place
and we lose a digit daily.

1278
01:24:21,374 --> 01:24:24,060
- I'm gonna phone him.
- As if he'll care.

1279
01:24:24,060 --> 01:24:26,937
He'll care, all right? That was
supposed to be his money.

1280
01:24:27,129 --> 01:24:29,143
Whether he cares about us
or not, is different.

1281
01:24:29,335 --> 01:24:31,158
Pass me the phone.

1282
01:24:46,122 --> 01:24:48,808
Yeah? That you, boy?

1283
01:24:48,903 --> 01:24:50,822
It's Ed,
if that's what you mean.

1284
01:24:51,206 --> 01:24:52,932
'Pay day, ain't it?'

1285
01:24:53,220 --> 01:24:56,481
Yeah...l wanted
to talk to you about that.

1286
01:24:56,577 --> 01:24:58,304
I'll bet you do.

1287
01:24:58,400 --> 01:24:59,935
I got half
a million nicker sitting here,

1288
01:25:00,318 --> 01:25:02,237
which means
some poor sod doesn't.

1289
01:25:02,620 --> 01:25:04,731
You've been upsetin' a few people, boy.

1290
01:25:06,169 --> 01:25:08,472
But that really
isn't my concern, is it?

1291
01:25:08,759 --> 01:25:12,309
What does concern me...
is the guns you had.

1292
01:25:12,692 --> 01:25:14,323
'l want to talk to you
about that.'

1293
01:25:14,898 --> 01:25:18,352
So get your arse over here now.
And I do mean now!

1294
01:25:52,116 --> 01:25:56,721
Bastard! You fucking bastard!

1295
01:26:05,258 --> 01:26:07,944
What the fuck
are you doing here?

1296
01:26:08,903 --> 01:26:12,740
What the fuck
are you doing here?

1297
01:26:23,195 --> 01:26:26,361
Job well done. We made
a few quid out of that one.

1298
01:26:26,936 --> 01:26:28,183
Son...?

1299
01:26:27,800 --> 01:26:29,814
Made a few quid, did you?

1300
01:26:30,198 --> 01:26:31,924
Where's what I want, now?

1301
01:26:33,267 --> 01:26:34,514
You all right down there, mate?

1302
01:26:34,610 --> 01:26:37,584
Very fucking funny.
Where's what I want?

1303
01:26:38,447 --> 01:26:40,078
I've just left it in the office.

1304
01:26:40,174 --> 01:26:41,804
Well, we'd better go to the office and get it,

1305
01:26:42,188 --> 01:26:44,586
that is if you want
your son to see his next birthday.

1306
01:26:44,682 --> 01:26:48,615
- Now chop-fucking-chop.
- All right. Fair enough.

1307
01:26:49,862 --> 01:26:51,301
Where you going?

1308
01:26:51,972 --> 01:26:54,754
It's a thirty second drive
or a five minute walk.

1309
01:26:55,233 --> 01:26:59,358
I couldn't have parked outside,
I'd have got a ticket.

1310
01:26:59,934 --> 01:27:01,372
I suppose that don't
matter now, does it?

1311
01:27:01,468 --> 01:27:03,387
Just be careful.

1312
01:27:03,483 --> 01:27:05,017
Right.

1313
01:27:11,828 --> 01:27:12,883
You and me.

1314
01:27:12,979 --> 01:27:13,746
You and who?

1315
01:27:13,938 --> 01:27:15,953
You know where
the door handle is, Tom.

1316
01:27:18,830 --> 01:27:22,283
# "The Payback" #
by James Brown

1317
01:27:23,339 --> 01:27:24,873
# Pay back

1318
01:27:25,449 --> 01:27:28,806
# That's it, pay back.

1319
01:27:29,957 --> 01:27:32,451
# Revenge, I'm mad

1320
01:27:33,698 --> 01:27:36,096
# Get down with my girlfriend

1321
01:27:37,343 --> 01:27:38,111
# That ain't right ##

1322
01:27:38,590 --> 01:27:40,892
Oh, no. Not again.

1323
01:27:56,048 --> 01:27:58,254
That's it. I'm off.

1324
01:27:59,022 --> 01:28:02,955
Tom...that is our bag.

1325
01:28:20,413 --> 01:28:23,002
- Ed...!
- Hold on.

1326
01:28:34,705 --> 01:28:36,911
This is our bag.

1327
01:28:39,213 --> 01:28:40,077
That's it. We're off.

1328
01:28:40,460 --> 01:28:43,242
- I'll see you in the car. I'm gonna take these guns.
- Tom, don't fuck about!

1329
01:28:43,242 --> 01:28:46,695
- I'll see you in the car.
- Tom !
- It'll only take a minute.

1330
01:29:01,275 --> 01:29:02,810
What is going on?

1331
01:29:03,098 --> 01:29:07,990
I don't know, but what I do know
is there's no more Harry.

1332
01:29:08,470 --> 01:29:10,292
Which means
there's no more debt.

1333
01:29:10,772 --> 01:29:14,033
And if there's no more debt,
there's no more problem.

1334
01:29:14,417 --> 01:29:17,870
And there's no problem with the
neighbours - because they're all dead.

1335
01:29:18,062 --> 01:29:21,323
And I think,
if I get this right,

1336
01:29:21,899 --> 01:29:25,352
we haven't done anything wrong
and we're in the clear.

1337
01:29:57,102 --> 01:29:58,829
Never ever...

1338
01:29:59,117 --> 01:30:03,145
has anyone
been as fucking rude...

1339
01:30:03,529 --> 01:30:04,872
..to me...

1340
01:30:05,256 --> 01:30:10,148
...as you,   YOU... FUCKING... BASTARD!

1341
01:30:26,742 --> 01:30:28,373
You all right, mate?

1342
01:30:29,140 --> 01:30:31,634
Cheeky bastard!

1343
01:30:48,421 --> 01:30:51,203
'Now this was an embarrassing
position for Tom to be in.

1344
01:30:51,490 --> 01:30:54,080
'But Chris had to respect
the fact that he was holding

1345
01:30:54,080 --> 01:30:56,574
'what appeared to be
a pair of loaded shotguns.

1346
01:30:57,054 --> 01:31:00,315
'And Tom had to respect the fact
that they were not loaded.

1347
01:31:00,507 --> 01:31:03,481
'So without anybody
losing too much face,

1348
01:31:03,768 --> 01:31:07,318
'Tom left through a side door
and Chris left with the money.

1349
01:31:07,414 --> 01:31:10,003
'And everybody else got arrested.'

1350
01:31:13,744 --> 01:31:15,375
He's not one of 'em.

1351
01:31:18,732 --> 01:31:23,049
# Sitting in the cheap seats
underneath the stars

1352
01:31:24,680 --> 01:31:26,886
# I'm heading back to base

1353
01:31:27,078 --> 01:31:28,708
# I'll drop you off
at mars ##

1354
01:31:29,859 --> 01:31:32,449
I think your dad would like
a word with you, Ed.

1355
01:31:36,382 --> 01:31:37,341
Where are the others?

1356
01:31:37,629 --> 01:31:40,603
They got out yesterday.
They're back at the bar.

1357
01:31:44,536 --> 01:31:46,166
# I'm a man machine

1358
01:31:47,605 --> 01:31:49,332
# Takin' gasoline

1359
01:31:50,962 --> 01:31:53,552
# Super-human being ##

1360
01:31:55,375 --> 01:31:56,526
All right, Dad?

1361
01:31:56,718 --> 01:31:58,636
I'm all right.
How about yourself?

1362
01:31:59,308 --> 01:32:03,336
I'm all right.
Could do with a drink, though.

1363
01:32:03,720 --> 01:32:06,214
All in good time. All in good time.

1364
01:32:06,694 --> 01:32:09,475
So, are you in the clear?

1365
01:32:09,667 --> 01:32:12,257
More importantly...am l?

1366
01:32:13,504 --> 01:32:14,751
It appears so.

1367
01:32:15,614 --> 01:32:20,506
Appears? You'll have to do
better than fucking appears, my friend.

1368
01:32:20,602 --> 01:32:22,041
Well, everybody's dead, Dad.

1369
01:32:22,041 --> 01:32:24,343
I think that's about as clear
as it can get.

1370
01:32:25,494 --> 01:32:26,933
How about that drink?

1371
01:32:27,029 --> 01:32:28,660
You know where the bar is.

1372
01:32:28,756 --> 01:32:29,907
Eh?

1373
01:32:31,346 --> 01:32:32,785
Don't make yourself
too comfortable.

1374
01:32:33,072 --> 01:32:35,854
Alan's got to sit there.
Alan!

1375
01:32:38,828 --> 01:32:40,362
You're lucky
you're still breathing,

1376
01:32:40,938 --> 01:32:42,665
Iet alone able to walk.

1377
01:32:43,240 --> 01:32:46,981
I suggest you take
full advantage of that fact.

1378
01:32:53,216 --> 01:32:56,573
# 'Cause I'm a man machine

1379
01:32:57,341 --> 01:32:59,451
# Takin' gasoline

1380
01:33:00,314 --> 01:33:02,137
# I'm a teen dream

1381
01:33:02,616 --> 01:33:04,151
# Super-human being

1382
01:33:04,535 --> 01:33:07,029
# I'm a man machine

1383
01:33:07,125 --> 01:33:10,194
# I'm a man machine ! ##

1384
01:33:10,386 --> 01:33:13,648
You took your time.
Where the hell have you been?

1385
01:33:14,127 --> 01:33:15,758
Sit down. I'll tell you.

1386
01:33:21,417 --> 01:33:25,254
The traffic warden identified
the neighbours' bodies.

1387
01:33:25,830 --> 01:33:28,707
Which sort of
puts us in the clear.

1388
01:33:28,803 --> 01:33:31,393
The only thing connecting us
with the case...

1389
01:33:31,873 --> 01:33:33,312
..is those shotguns.

1390
01:33:33,503 --> 01:33:35,614
And Tom took care of them.

1391
01:33:36,669 --> 01:33:39,834
You did take care of the shotguns,
didn't you, Tom?

1392
01:33:41,465 --> 01:33:43,000
I wanted to talk to you about that.

1393
01:33:43,192 --> 01:33:44,343
Well, talk.

1394
01:33:45,494 --> 01:33:48,467
Well, actually...no.

1395
01:33:50,002 --> 01:33:52,304
I've got them sittin' in the car,
I.. I was gonna sell 'em back to Nick the Greek,

1396
01:33:52,400 --> 01:33:54,415
but I am having a bit of a problem
gettin' hold of him.

1397
01:33:54,702 --> 01:33:56,045
You dippy bastard.

1398
01:33:56,141 --> 01:34:01,897
So...the only thing
connecting us with the case

1399
01:34:02,184 --> 01:34:04,966
is in the back of your car,
which is parked outside!

1400
01:34:05,254 --> 01:34:08,899
They costed 700 quid.
I'm not gonna throw 'em away.

1401
01:34:09,570 --> 01:34:12,448
And they're hardly likely to trace
'em back to us, are they?

1402
01:34:12,544 --> 01:34:15,422
Do you really think it's worth taking the
the risk for £700?

1403
01:34:15,613 --> 01:34:17,628
Tom, you're a dick!

1404
01:34:18,107 --> 01:34:20,505
Now you take those guns
and you throw 'em off a bridge.

1405
01:34:20,985 --> 01:34:22,999
And throw yourself off while you're at it.

1406
01:34:23,287 --> 01:34:25,014
Now.... Tom.

1407
01:34:29,234 --> 01:34:32,112
- Look, all I'm...
- Now, Tom !

1408
01:34:38,059 --> 01:34:39,978
Can I have a beer, please, Dad?

1409
01:34:40,074 --> 01:34:42,472
I'm busy. Get it yourself.

1410
01:34:58,203 --> 01:35:00,889
It seemed Hatchet
underestimated you lot.

1411
01:35:01,177 --> 01:35:03,287
And it seems to have cost him.

1412
01:35:04,246 --> 01:35:06,740
I ain't gonna make
the same mistake now, am l?

1413
01:35:07,699 --> 01:35:10,193
So I've decided
to bring your bag back.

1414
01:35:11,920 --> 01:35:15,565
I think the word you're looking
for, gentlemen, is "thank you".

1415
01:35:16,045 --> 01:35:17,771
Thank you.

1416
01:35:19,018 --> 01:35:21,512
Now you've presented me
with a problem.

1417
01:35:21,608 --> 01:35:23,814
I've lost my employer.

1418
01:35:25,349 --> 01:35:29,282
So I've taken care
of meself and me son.

1419
01:35:29,761 --> 01:35:33,502
Now if you think that's unfair,
you come and pay me a little visit.

1420
01:35:33,694 --> 01:35:35,613
But you better be
waving a white flag,

1421
01:35:35,709 --> 01:35:39,258
high and clear
so as I can see it.

1422
01:35:39,642 --> 01:35:41,848
Or it'll be the last little visit
you ever make.

1423
01:35:43,191 --> 01:35:45,301
You understand ?

1424
01:35:46,548 --> 01:35:49,522
That's all I've come to say.

1425
01:35:50,769 --> 01:35:53,071
There is one more thing...

1426
01:35:54,893 --> 01:35:57,003
It's been emotional.

1427
01:35:59,402 --> 01:36:02,375
# "Fool's Gold" #

1428

1429

# Winds on through the hills
for fifteen days ##

1430
01:36:23,574 --> 01:36:27,507
We are now officially in
the money-lending business, all right, son?

1431
01:36:28,274 --> 01:36:29,713
Put your seatbelt on.

1432
01:36:30,384 --> 01:36:32,207
We're out of here.

1433
01:36:40,265 --> 01:36:42,471
It's empty.

1434
01:37:03,957 --> 01:37:07,698
# The pack on my back is aching

1435
01:37:08,082 --> 01:37:11,535

to cut me like a knife

1436
01:37:22,662 --> 01:37:24,677
# I'm no clown
I won't back down

1437
01:37:24,677 --> 01:37:30,048
# I don't need you
to tell me what's going down...

1438
01:37:49,808 --> 01:37:52,110
What's his number?

1439
01:37:57,962 --> 01:38:01,031
Don't! Don't! You'll jam the line!
I'll call him!

1440
01:38:07,938 --> 01:38:09,376
My fucking batteries!

1441
01:38:09,376 --> 01:38:12,926
- No, you muppet!
- Give me the phone! Give me the fucking phone!

1442
01:38:13,117 --> 01:38:15,324
- I'll dial it!
- Tell me the number!

1443
01:38:25,204 --> 01:38:29,616
- Now give me your phone!
- You'll break it!

1444
01:38:33,069 --> 01:38:35,659
- You give me the phone!
- You'll break it and it'll be fucked!

1445
01:38:35,659 --> 01:38:38,921
You shut it. It's fucking ringing!

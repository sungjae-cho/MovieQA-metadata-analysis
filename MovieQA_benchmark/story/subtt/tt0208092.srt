1
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:34,710
<i>My name is Turkish.</i>

2
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:37,086
<i>Funny name for an Englishman, I know.</i>

3
00:00:37,346 --> 00:00:40,796
<i>My parents were on the same plane
when it crashed. That's how they met.</i>

4
00:00:42,224 --> 00:00:44,347
<i>They named me after the plane.</i>

5
00:00:44,601 --> 00:00:47,092
<i>Not many people are
named after a plane crash.</i>

6
00:00:47,896 --> 00:00:49,307
<i>That's Tommy.</i>

7
00:00:49,606 --> 00:00:51,764
<i>He tells people
he was named after a gun.</i>

8
00:00:52,317 --> 00:00:57,024
<i>But I know he was really named after
a famous 19th century ballet dancer.</i>

9
00:00:57,571 --> 00:01:01,189
<i>Known him for as long as I can
remember. He's my partner.</i>

10
00:01:01,533 --> 00:01:04,154
<i>Doesn't mean we hold hands
or take walks.</i>

11
00:01:04,452 --> 00:01:08,744
<i>It means I try to keep him out of
as much trouble as he inflicts on me.</i>

12
00:01:08,997 --> 00:01:11,867
<i>I give him a hard time.
Keeps him in check.</i>

13
00:01:12,166 --> 00:01:14,622
<i>But really, he's like my brother.</i>

14
00:01:15,336 --> 00:01:18,954
<i>What do I know about diamonds?
I'm a boxing promoter.</i>

15
00:01:19,256 --> 00:01:22,838
<i>I was a happy boxing promoter
until a week ago, and then:</i>

16
00:01:23,134 --> 00:01:25,292
<i>What do I know about diamonds?</i>

17
00:01:26,137 --> 00:01:28,213
<i>Don't they come from Antwerp?</i>

18
00:01:29,181 --> 00:01:32,431
<i>- Himy, would you listen to this?
- Do we have a choice?</i>

19
00:01:32,726 --> 00:01:36,390
<i>It wasn't meant to be taken literally.</i>

20
00:01:36,687 --> 00:01:39,439
<i>It's a nice story, Adam and Eve.</i>

21
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:41,729
<i>It's bound with moral fibre...</i>

22
00:01:42,025 --> 00:01:45,608
<i>... but asking a grown man
to believe it?</i>

23
00:01:46,612 --> 00:01:47,857
<i>What is it?</i>

24
00:01:50,115 --> 00:01:51,609
<i>Well, what is it?</i>

25
00:01:53,285 --> 00:01:56,617
<i>What you want I should do,
drop my pants?</i>

26
00:01:56,912 --> 00:01:58,490
<i>Okay, go through.</i>

27
00:01:59,872 --> 00:02:01,912
<i>It's a nice story.</i>

28
00:02:02,625 --> 00:02:05,579
<i>It's just that. Just a story.</i>

29
00:02:05,878 --> 00:02:09,246
<i>Catholic religion is based
on a mistranslation.</i>

30
00:02:09,548 --> 00:02:11,955
<i>Enough already. Ruben, say something.</i>

31
00:02:12,259 --> 00:02:14,795
<i>Listen. Are you busy?
I'll tell you the whole story.</i>

32
00:02:15,052 --> 00:02:19,263
<i>The Septuagint scholars mistranslated
the Hebrew word for "young woman"...</i>

33
00:02:19,556 --> 00:02:21,679
<i>... into the Greek word for "virgin."</i>

34
00:02:21,933 --> 00:02:24,341
<i>It was an easy mistake to make...</i>

35
00:02:24,602 --> 00:02:29,144
<i>... because there was only a subtle
difference in the spelling.</i>

36
00:02:39,115 --> 00:02:41,272
<i>So, they came up with a prophecy:</i>

37
00:02:41,574 --> 00:02:45,738
<i>"Behold, the virgin shall conceive
and bear us a son. "</i>

38
00:02:45,995 --> 00:02:50,040
<i>You understand? It was "virgin"
that caught people's attention.</i>

39
00:02:50,333 --> 00:02:54,495
<i>It's not everyday a virgin conceives
and bears a son.</i>

40
00:03:10,599 --> 00:03:14,810
<i>But leave that for a couple
of hundred years to stew...</i>

41
00:03:15,103 --> 00:03:18,638
<i>... and next thing you know you have
the Holy Catholic Church.</i>

42
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:22,023
<i>Oy vay, what are you saying?</i>

43
00:03:22,276 --> 00:03:24,849
<i>I'm saying, just because
it's written...</i>

44
00:03:25,153 --> 00:03:26,647
<i>... doesn't make it so.</i>

45
00:03:26,947 --> 00:03:30,814
<i>Gives them hope. It's not important
whether it's fact or fiction.</i>

46
00:03:31,117 --> 00:03:33,488
<i>- People like to believe.
- I don't want to hear anymore.</i>

47
00:03:33,744 --> 00:03:36,994
<i>Anyway, who is it that we're seeing?</i>

48
00:03:37,664 --> 00:03:39,288
<i>- Michael.
- Hello?</i>

49
00:03:41,042 --> 00:03:42,240
<i>Mutti.</i>

50
00:03:42,543 --> 00:03:46,161
Rudy! Rud, Rud, let them in, please.

51
00:03:48,965 --> 00:03:52,168
Rud, it's okay, let them through.

52
00:03:52,427 --> 00:03:53,422
- Michael.
- Mutti.

53
00:03:53,678 --> 00:03:58,339
You've kept us waiting for half an hour.
Are you trying to give me heartburn?

54
00:04:04,854 --> 00:04:06,312
Lie down on the floor.

55
00:04:08,857 --> 00:04:10,055
Get on the floor!

56
00:04:10,818 --> 00:04:12,016
Lie on the floor!

57
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:13,978
Get on the fucking floor!

58
00:04:14,987 --> 00:04:17,608
- Get down!
- Get fucking down!

59
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:20,114
Down on the floor! Get down!

60
00:04:20,409 --> 00:04:21,607
On the ground!

61
00:04:25,997 --> 00:04:27,621
Get down, I say!

62
00:04:27,915 --> 00:04:29,907
- Time.
- Seven minutes!

63
00:04:33,712 --> 00:04:34,910
Where is the stone?

64
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:40,256
Where is the stone?

65
00:04:41,802 --> 00:04:44,423
Where is the stone?

66
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,178
Michael, where is the stone?

67
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:19,416
When does your plane leave?

68
00:06:19,968 --> 00:06:21,711
Twenty minutes.

69
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:24,012
Give me your gun.

70
00:06:35,564 --> 00:06:37,557
When you get to London...

71
00:06:37,817 --> 00:06:39,643
...if you want a gun...

72
00:06:40,443 --> 00:06:41,771
...call this number.

73
00:06:46,282 --> 00:06:48,570
- Boris.
- Boris.

74
00:06:49,285 --> 00:06:51,989
He can get you anything you need.

75
00:06:59,126 --> 00:07:01,000
Is he allowed to do that?

76
00:07:01,336 --> 00:07:05,583
It's an unlicensed boxing match.
It's not a tickling competition.

77
00:07:05,882 --> 00:07:07,921
These lads are out
to hurt each other.

78
00:07:08,634 --> 00:07:10,507
What's with those sausages,
Charlie?

79
00:07:10,802 --> 00:07:12,380
Two minutes, Turkish.

80
00:07:14,097 --> 00:07:17,797
Look at it. How am I supposed
to run this thing from that?

81
00:07:18,101 --> 00:07:19,559
We'll need a proper office.

82
00:07:19,852 --> 00:07:22,769
I want a new one.
You're going to buy it for me.

83
00:07:23,063 --> 00:07:24,605
Why me?

84
00:07:25,357 --> 00:07:27,230
Well, you know about caravans.

85
00:07:27,483 --> 00:07:28,894
How's that?

86
00:07:29,235 --> 00:07:32,568
You spent a summer in one.
Which means you know more than me.

87
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:36,029
And I don't want to have me pants
pulled down over the price.

88
00:07:36,324 --> 00:07:37,604
What's wrong with this one?

89
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:41,201
Oh, nothing, Tommy.

90
00:07:41,495 --> 00:07:43,287
It's tiptop.

91
00:07:43,539 --> 00:07:45,330
I'm just not sure about the colour.

92
00:07:47,417 --> 00:07:49,705
It's all arranged.
You just got to pick it up.

93
00:07:50,378 --> 00:07:51,753
Here's an address.

94
00:07:53,464 --> 00:07:54,922
It's a campsite.

95
00:07:55,799 --> 00:07:59,500
You've got 10 grand, and
it would be nice to see change.

96
00:08:00,304 --> 00:08:03,469
- What's happening with them sausages?
- Five minutes.

97
00:08:05,724 --> 00:08:08,297
It was two minutes five minutes ago.

98
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,185
They ain't pikeys, are they?

99
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:13,100
I fucking hate pikeys.

100
00:08:13,398 --> 00:08:15,970
You're a sensitive boy, Tommy.

101
00:08:18,777 --> 00:08:20,769
Fuck me. Hold tight.

102
00:08:21,321 --> 00:08:23,859
- What's that?
- It's me belt.

103
00:08:24,157 --> 00:08:26,445
No, Tommy. There's a gun
in your trousers.

104
00:08:26,743 --> 00:08:29,826
- What's a gun doing in your trousers?
- It's for protection.

105
00:08:30,078 --> 00:08:31,276
Protection from what?

106
00:08:31,579 --> 00:08:33,371
"Zee" Germans?

107
00:08:33,623 --> 00:08:36,789
What's to stop it blowing your
bollocks off when you sit?

108
00:08:37,043 --> 00:08:40,246
- Where did you get it?
- Boris The Blade.

109
00:08:40,503 --> 00:08:42,994
You mean Boris the sneaky,
fucking Russian.

110
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,250
Heavy, isn't it?

111
00:08:47,218 --> 00:08:48,167
Heavy is good.

112
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:50,633
Heavy is reliable.

113
00:08:50,888 --> 00:08:53,509
If it doesn't work,
you can always hit him with it.

114
00:08:53,766 --> 00:08:56,849
<i>Boris The Blade,
or Boris The Bullet-Dodger.</i>

115
00:08:57,143 --> 00:09:00,393
<i>Bent as the Soviet sickle and
hard as the hammer that crosses it.</i>

116
00:09:00,646 --> 00:09:04,690
<i>Apparently, it's just impossible
to kill the bastard.</i>

117
00:09:06,318 --> 00:09:08,642
<i>Back to my partner, Tommy.</i>

118
00:09:09,028 --> 00:09:10,736
<i>Tommy runs the other business...</i>

119
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:12,607
<i>... the slot machines...</i>

120
00:09:12,906 --> 00:09:16,405
<i>... which keeps rain off our heads
and gloves on Gorgeous' hands.</i>

121
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:20,988
<i>However, Tommy's a little preoccupied
with protection at present.</i>

122
00:09:21,997 --> 00:09:23,491
All right, I'll take it.

123
00:09:24,041 --> 00:09:27,658
<i>There's a reason for Tommy's newfound
enthusiasm for firearms.</i>

124
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:32,372
<i>Sooner or later, in unlicensed boxing,
you have to deal with that reason:</i>

125
00:09:32,673 --> 00:09:33,871
<i>Brick Top.</i>

126
00:09:34,173 --> 00:09:36,746
If that's not worth a bet,
I don't know what is.

127
00:09:37,009 --> 00:09:40,093
- He doesn't look bad, does he?
- No, he looks great.

128
00:09:40,387 --> 00:09:41,762
He'll do you proud.

129
00:09:42,055 --> 00:09:46,100
You reckon that's what people should
do for me, Gary? Do me proud?

130
00:09:46,351 --> 00:09:47,381
It's what you deserve.

131
00:09:47,643 --> 00:09:50,015
Pull your tongue out of my arsehole.

132
00:09:51,063 --> 00:09:52,261
Dogs do that.

133
00:09:53,023 --> 00:09:54,766
You're not a dog, are you?

134
00:09:55,066 --> 00:09:56,442
No. No, I'm not.

135
00:09:56,901 --> 00:09:58,099
However...

136
00:09:59,153 --> 00:10:02,604
...you do have all the characteristics
of a dog, Gary.

137
00:10:02,906 --> 00:10:04,104
All except loyalty.

138
00:10:04,407 --> 00:10:08,784
<i>It's rumoured that his favourite means
of dispatch involves a stun gun...</i>

139
00:10:09,078 --> 00:10:13,206
<i>... a plastic bag, a roll of tape
and a pack of hungry pigs.</i>

140
00:10:14,165 --> 00:10:17,830
You're a ruthless little cunt, Liam.
I'll give you that.

141
00:10:20,087 --> 00:10:22,792
But I got no time for grouses.

142
00:10:24,884 --> 00:10:26,959
Feed him to the pigs, Errol.

143
00:10:28,469 --> 00:10:30,675
What the fuck are you two looking at?

144
00:10:33,641 --> 00:10:37,934
<i>If you got to deal with him, just
make sure you don't end up owing him.</i>

145
00:10:38,187 --> 00:10:39,431
<i>Then you're in his debt.</i>

146
00:10:39,688 --> 00:10:41,893
<i>Which means, you're in his pocket.</i>

147
00:10:42,189 --> 00:10:45,523
<i>And once you're in that,
you ain't ever coming out.</i>

148
00:10:46,193 --> 00:10:49,277
I hear he's a good fighter,
so I'll use him.

149
00:10:49,529 --> 00:10:51,736
I'll be doing you a favour, boy.

150
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:54,859
<i>What he means is,
I'm doing him a favour.</i>

151
00:10:55,534 --> 00:11:00,610
<i>Because everybody knows nobody takes
a dive in my fights. Unlike his.</i>

152
00:11:01,623 --> 00:11:03,496
Here, Errol, I don't think
he likes me.

153
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:05,208
You don't like me, do you?

154
00:11:05,501 --> 00:11:06,782
Don't know what you mean.

155
00:11:07,086 --> 00:11:10,039
<i>I do know I can't wait to get
out of here. It stinks.</i>

156
00:11:10,964 --> 00:11:15,542
My fights finish prompt so we can get
out before the authorities find out.

157
00:11:15,802 --> 00:11:18,043
Play your cards right
and I'll sort you out.

158
00:11:18,346 --> 00:11:20,752
<i>You can sort me out by showing me out.</i>

159
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:23,842
<i>It's hard to make a living
in boxing, so now and then...</i>

160
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:26,638
<i>... you do something
against your principles.</i>

161
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:29,890
<i>Basically, you have to forget
you got any.</i>

162
00:11:30,147 --> 00:11:31,558
Are they Lancashire pigs?

163
00:11:31,815 --> 00:11:33,310
Who's talking to you?

164
00:11:33,901 --> 00:11:36,900
<i>Oh, yeah, Tommy.
Brick Top loves Tommy.</i>

165
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,352
Don't let me down.

166
00:11:40,614 --> 00:11:42,986
You don't want to let me down, do you?

167
00:11:45,202 --> 00:11:47,159
See you ringside.

168
00:11:49,788 --> 00:11:53,952
Boris, Franky-fucking-Four Fingers...

169
00:11:54,251 --> 00:11:56,872
...has a diamond the size of a fist.

170
00:11:57,170 --> 00:12:00,753
I have told you it's in the briefcase
connected to his arm.

171
00:12:01,006 --> 00:12:03,212
I sent him to you to buy a gun.

172
00:12:03,467 --> 00:12:06,254
What more do you want me to do,
hit him for you?

173
00:12:06,511 --> 00:12:08,883
But don't you hit him either.

174
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:12,216
Americans can't know it was Russian.

175
00:12:12,517 --> 00:12:14,140
It will come back to me.

176
00:12:16,394 --> 00:12:18,303
You're my brother, so think like it.

177
00:12:20,356 --> 00:12:22,598
Get somebody else to steal that stone!

178
00:12:22,859 --> 00:12:24,935
I don't want it getting back to me.

179
00:12:25,236 --> 00:12:28,070
And don't have him killed.
It will raise suspicion.

180
00:12:28,321 --> 00:12:30,064
So don't use idiots for the job.

181
00:12:30,365 --> 00:12:33,947
He'll stay in London a couple of
days before he goes to New York...

182
00:12:34,201 --> 00:12:36,609
...so move quick. Okay?

183
00:12:40,499 --> 00:12:41,873
One more thing.

184
00:12:42,166 --> 00:12:43,708
It might help.

185
00:12:44,251 --> 00:12:45,995
He loves to gamble.

186
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,374
Eighty-six carats?

187
00:12:49,673 --> 00:12:51,582
Brilliant cut, beautiful make.

188
00:12:53,385 --> 00:12:54,878
A beautiful stone.

189
00:12:55,177 --> 00:12:56,173
<i>You're a good boy, Franky.</i>

190
00:12:56,428 --> 00:12:59,512
And you did a real good job.
Now when do you get back?

191
00:12:59,765 --> 00:13:04,557
I got to move the two-grainers here,
get a better price. Couple of days.

192
00:13:04,811 --> 00:13:07,302
- Talk to my cousin Dougie.
- Doug The Head?

193
00:13:11,315 --> 00:13:12,145
And Franky...

194
00:13:12,817 --> 00:13:14,892
<i>- And what?
- Stay out of those casinos.</i>

195
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:20,023
<i>You did a good job, bubbe.</i>

196
00:13:20,323 --> 00:13:23,193
<i>- Don't go screwing it up, all right?
- I hear you, Avi.</i>

197
00:13:23,742 --> 00:13:25,818
I'll see you, Avi.

198
00:13:29,039 --> 00:13:30,367
Eighty-six carats.

199
00:13:30,624 --> 00:13:32,248
- Where?
- London.

200
00:13:32,542 --> 00:13:34,084
- London?
- London.

201
00:13:34,334 --> 00:13:36,327
- London?
- Yes, London.

202
00:13:37,212 --> 00:13:39,917
You know, fish, chips, cup of tea...

203
00:13:40,215 --> 00:13:43,334
...bad food, worse weather,
Mary-fucking-Poppins. London!

204
00:13:45,345 --> 00:13:46,340
Not for me.

205
00:13:46,637 --> 00:13:49,721
<i>That's Doug The Head.
Everybody knows Doug The Head.</i>

206
00:13:50,015 --> 00:13:52,470
<i>If it's stones and it's stolen,
he's the man to speak to.</i>

207
00:13:52,725 --> 00:13:54,054
<i>Pretends he's Jewish.</i>

208
00:13:54,352 --> 00:13:55,846
<i>Wishes he was Jewish.</i>

209
00:13:56,104 --> 00:13:58,310
<i>Even tells his family
they're Jewish...</i>

210
00:13:58,606 --> 00:14:01,855
<i>... but he's about as Jewish
as he is a fucking monkey.</i>

211
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:06,064
<i>He thinks it's good for business.
And in the diamond business...</i>

212
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,692
<i>...it is good for business.
- Avi!</i>

213
00:14:08,948 --> 00:14:11,024
He'll be there today.
Take care of him.

214
00:14:11,325 --> 00:14:13,898
Avi, you know I won't buy schtrops.

215
00:14:14,161 --> 00:14:16,781
He isn't selling schtrops.
Make it smaller.

216
00:14:17,038 --> 00:14:19,113
Who do you take me for?
This is England.

217
00:14:19,373 --> 00:14:21,164
<i>We play by the rules.</i>

218
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:22,745
Listen to me.

219
00:14:23,043 --> 00:14:26,293
If the stones are kosher,
then I'll buy them, won't I?

220
00:14:26,588 --> 00:14:30,454
Now, if you'll excuse me,
it's my lunchtime. Bye.

221
00:14:36,388 --> 00:14:37,930
What are you doing here?

222
00:14:38,181 --> 00:14:40,008
It's a free country, isn't it?

223
00:14:40,767 --> 00:14:43,138
Well, it ain't a free shop, is it?

224
00:14:43,435 --> 00:14:45,226
So fuck off.

225
00:14:55,904 --> 00:14:58,525
I want to see you two girls
up in my office.

226
00:14:59,157 --> 00:15:00,865
I had cousin Avi on the phone.

227
00:15:01,159 --> 00:15:03,863
- You got to go see him.
- Yeah, Dad. You told us.

228
00:15:04,162 --> 00:15:07,447
- He's a big mucker in New York.
- Yeah, Dad. You told us.

229
00:15:07,706 --> 00:15:10,161
I want to see you girls
up in my office.

230
00:15:10,416 --> 00:15:12,872
Yeah, Dad. You told us.

231
00:15:18,382 --> 00:15:20,955
The weight is sign of reliability.

232
00:15:21,801 --> 00:15:23,840
I always go for reliability.

233
00:15:31,685 --> 00:15:33,642
I'll take it.

234
00:15:34,062 --> 00:15:35,472
How much do you want for it?

235
00:15:35,729 --> 00:15:36,892
Nothing.

236
00:15:38,565 --> 00:15:41,732
Okay, so what do you want for it?

237
00:15:41,985 --> 00:15:43,527
I want you to do something for me.

238
00:15:45,614 --> 00:15:47,440
There is a fight in couple of days.

239
00:15:48,907 --> 00:15:50,282
What kind of a fight?

240
00:15:50,534 --> 00:15:52,194
Unlicensed boxing.

241
00:15:53,745 --> 00:15:56,580
There is a bookies I know
that will take bets.

242
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:01,368
If you place one down for me...

243
00:16:02,002 --> 00:16:03,496
...we will call it quits.

244
00:16:03,795 --> 00:16:06,037
- Why don't you put it down yourself?
- Well...

245
00:16:07,674 --> 00:16:11,671
...there is not too many bookies
that takes those kind of bets.

246
00:16:12,553 --> 00:16:16,087
And I already have an outstanding
debt with the house.

247
00:16:18,307 --> 00:16:20,845
I know something most don't.

248
00:16:21,727 --> 00:16:23,269
<i>So, nu?</i>

249
00:16:24,438 --> 00:16:25,980
What do you know?

250
00:16:30,651 --> 00:16:33,403
It's a campsite. A pikey campsite.

251
00:16:33,654 --> 00:16:36,655
- Ten points.
- What are we doing here?

252
00:16:37,491 --> 00:16:40,741
- We're buying a caravan.
- Off a pack of fucking pikeys?

253
00:16:41,036 --> 00:16:43,905
What's wrong with you?
This will get messy.

254
00:16:44,204 --> 00:16:44,986
Not if you're here.

255
00:16:45,247 --> 00:16:47,074
Oh, you bastard.

256
00:16:47,332 --> 00:16:49,823
I fucking hate pikeys.

257
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:54,254
That's a flash car, mister.

258
00:16:54,506 --> 00:16:55,963
Not as flash as your bike.

259
00:16:56,256 --> 00:16:58,129
Who are you looking for?

260
00:16:58,382 --> 00:16:59,627
Mr. O'Neil.

261
00:17:00,467 --> 00:17:02,626
- Want me to get him?
- That's a good lad.

262
00:17:02,886 --> 00:17:04,630
Piss off.

263
00:17:05,597 --> 00:17:08,169
- Are you going to go get him for me?
- Yeah.

264
00:17:09,141 --> 00:17:12,177
- What are you waiting for?
- The five quid you'll pay me.

265
00:17:12,477 --> 00:17:14,102
Fuck off, I'll find him meself.

266
00:17:14,354 --> 00:17:16,643
- Two fifty.
- You can have a quid.

267
00:17:16,898 --> 00:17:18,440
You're a real tight fucker.

268
00:17:18,692 --> 00:17:20,731
<i>There was a problem with gypsies.</i>

269
00:17:21,027 --> 00:17:22,437
What're you doing?
Get out of the way, man.

270
00:17:22,694 --> 00:17:24,734
<i>You can't understand
what's being said.</i>

271
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:26,572
You Tommy? Come about the caravan?

272
00:17:26,823 --> 00:17:29,065
- Mr. O'Neil.
- Fuck, man. Call me Mickey.

273
00:17:29,325 --> 00:17:30,867
<i>Not Irish, not English.</i>

274
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:33,367
- How are you?
- Weather's been kind.

275
00:17:33,663 --> 00:17:35,322
<i>It's just Pikey.</i>

276
00:17:36,081 --> 00:17:37,705
Would you look at the size of him?

277
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:39,785
How big are you?

278
00:17:40,043 --> 00:17:42,035
- Kids, how big is he?
- Big, for sure.

279
00:17:42,295 --> 00:17:44,916
Hey, Mam, come and look at the size
of this fella.

280
00:17:45,881 --> 00:17:50,376
Bet you box a little, can't you, sir?
You look like a boxer.

281
00:17:50,676 --> 00:17:53,214
Get out of the way.
See if they'd like a drink.

282
00:17:53,471 --> 00:17:54,751
I could murder one.

283
00:17:55,056 --> 00:17:58,056
Be no murdering done around here,
I don't mind telling you.

284
00:17:58,309 --> 00:18:00,301
Get your hands out of there.

285
00:18:00,602 --> 00:18:02,143
Cup of tea for the big fella?

286
00:18:02,395 --> 00:18:05,514
Don't be silly, Mickey.
Offer the man a proper drink.

287
00:18:07,149 --> 00:18:08,180
You little bugger.

288
00:18:08,442 --> 00:18:11,608
- Is the big fella not coming with us?
- He's minding the car.

289
00:18:11,903 --> 00:18:15,651
- What does he think we are, thieves?
- No, nothing like that.

290
00:18:15,906 --> 00:18:19,026
- He just likes looking after cars.
- Good dags. Do you like dags?

291
00:18:19,868 --> 00:18:21,066
- Dags?
- What?

292
00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:23,409
- Yeah, dags.
- Dags. You like dags?

293
00:18:23,914 --> 00:18:25,657
Oh, dogs.

294
00:18:25,915 --> 00:18:27,623
Sure, I like dags.

295
00:18:27,876 --> 00:18:30,661
- I like caravans more.
- You're very welcome.

296
00:18:42,053 --> 00:18:45,802
<i>Pikeys are well-known for their
skills of negotiation in business.</i>

297
00:18:46,099 --> 00:18:48,056
<i>It's probably why
they talk like that...</i>

298
00:18:48,351 --> 00:18:50,427
<i>... so you can't follow
what's being said.</i>

299
00:18:50,686 --> 00:18:54,102
<i>But if Tommy can get the caravan
for less than the price asked...</i>

300
00:18:54,398 --> 00:18:56,722
<i>... on his return
there will be ice cream.</i>

301
00:18:57,024 --> 00:18:58,768
Good dog, good family.

302
00:18:59,026 --> 00:19:01,695
He'll get a little homesick,
but he'll get over it.

303
00:19:02,238 --> 00:19:04,859
See you later, lads. See you, boss.

304
00:19:05,115 --> 00:19:07,274
All right, Mickey. Laters.

305
00:19:08,743 --> 00:19:10,237
I don't see what the fuss is about.

306
00:19:10,953 --> 00:19:12,233
They aren't bad fellas.

307
00:19:22,463 --> 00:19:24,669
The deal was, you bought it
how you saw it.

308
00:19:24,923 --> 00:19:28,007
Look, I've helped you as much
as I'm going to help you.

309
00:19:28,301 --> 00:19:30,093
See that car? Use it.

310
00:19:30,345 --> 00:19:33,963
You should fuck off now while
you still got the legs to carry you.

311
00:19:35,641 --> 00:19:37,183
Nobody brings you...

312
00:19:37,434 --> 00:19:40,304
...unless they're trying
to say something without talking.

313
00:19:41,271 --> 00:19:44,188
Just give our money back
and you can keep your caravan.

314
00:19:44,482 --> 00:19:47,483
Why do I want a caravan
that's got no wheels?

315
00:19:47,735 --> 00:19:50,854
- You want to settle this with a fight?
- Over my dead body.

316
00:19:51,154 --> 00:19:52,434
Now, go on! Go on!

317
00:19:52,739 --> 00:19:56,653
I'll not have you fighting!
You know what happens when you fight!

318
00:19:57,285 --> 00:19:58,660
Get her to sit down.

319
00:19:59,412 --> 00:20:00,954
For fuck's sake!

320
00:20:07,168 --> 00:20:08,911
Want the money?
I ain't fucked you.

321
00:20:09,462 --> 00:20:11,703
I'll fight you for it. You and me.

322
00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:27,008
So that's the kind of fight
it'll be.

323
00:20:27,644 --> 00:20:29,470
You want to stay down.

324
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:35,941
You want to stay down!

325
00:20:39,112 --> 00:20:41,484
Get back down and fucking stay down.

326
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:44,151
I promise you, you want to stay down.

327
00:20:44,406 --> 00:20:46,482
Deadly kick for a fat fucker,
you know that?

328
00:20:46,784 --> 00:20:48,741
Cheeky bastard.

329
00:20:55,791 --> 00:20:57,534
- Okay, lads.
- Get him on his feet.

330
00:20:59,002 --> 00:21:00,033
Get back down...

331
00:21:00,295 --> 00:21:03,082
...or you will not be coming up
next time.

332
00:21:06,634 --> 00:21:07,500
Bollocks to you.

333
00:21:08,136 --> 00:21:09,926
This is sick. I'm out of here.

334
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:12,711
You're not going anywhere,
you thick lump.

335
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:17,974
You stay until the job's done.

336
00:21:51,172 --> 00:21:54,671
<i>It turned out that the sweet-talking,
tattoo-sporting pikey...</i>

337
00:21:54,925 --> 00:21:57,712
<i>... was a gypsy bare-knuckle
boxing champion.</i>

338
00:21:57,970 --> 00:22:00,674
<i>Which makes him harder
than a coffin nail.</i>

339
00:22:01,598 --> 00:22:05,179
<i>Right now that's the last thing
on Tommy's mind.</i>

340
00:22:05,434 --> 00:22:08,138
<i>If Gorgeous doesn't wake up
in the next few minutes...</i>

341
00:22:08,437 --> 00:22:10,643
<i>... Tommy knows he'll be buried
with him.</i>

342
00:22:11,398 --> 00:22:13,935
<i>Why would the gypsies
want to explain...</i>

343
00:22:14,234 --> 00:22:16,355
<i>... why a man died in their campsite?</i>

344
00:22:16,610 --> 00:22:19,813
<i>Not when they can bury the pair
of them and just move camp.</i>

345
00:22:20,155 --> 00:22:23,570
<i>It's not like they got
social security numbers, is it?</i>

346
00:22:23,908 --> 00:22:26,150
<i>Tommy, "The Tit"...</i>

347
00:22:26,410 --> 00:22:28,035
<i>... is praying.</i>

348
00:22:28,287 --> 00:22:29,567
<i>And if he isn't...</i>

349
00:22:29,871 --> 00:22:31,863
<i>... he fucking should be.</i>

350
00:22:59,688 --> 00:23:00,851
Bad Boy.

351
00:23:01,482 --> 00:23:03,225
- Sol.
- Easy.

352
00:23:03,525 --> 00:23:06,230
No, it's a moissanite.

353
00:23:06,486 --> 00:23:07,400
A what?

354
00:23:07,988 --> 00:23:11,023
A moissanite is an artificial
diamond, Lincoln.

355
00:23:11,281 --> 00:23:12,312
It's Mickey Mouse.

356
00:23:13,241 --> 00:23:14,321
Spurious.

357
00:23:15,118 --> 00:23:16,577
Not genuine.

358
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,744
And it's worth...

359
00:23:19,289 --> 00:23:20,284
...fuck-all.

360
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:23,493
Bad Boy, I keep telling you,
stick to being a gangster.

361
00:23:23,792 --> 00:23:25,583
Leave this game to me and Sol.

362
00:23:27,045 --> 00:23:28,243
Laters.

363
00:23:32,050 --> 00:23:33,129
What is that, Vince?

364
00:23:33,384 --> 00:23:35,092
This is a dog, Sol.

365
00:23:35,343 --> 00:23:37,501
You are not bringing
that thing in here.

366
00:23:37,762 --> 00:23:39,422
It's only a fucking dog.

367
00:23:39,681 --> 00:23:41,223
- Where'd you get it?
- The gyppos.

368
00:23:41,474 --> 00:23:42,553
Here.

369
00:23:44,018 --> 00:23:45,642
They threw it in with the moody gold.

370
00:23:46,896 --> 00:23:50,512
You know gyppos, Sol. They're always
throwing dogs in with deals.

371
00:23:50,773 --> 00:23:52,018
It better not be dangerous.

372
00:23:54,151 --> 00:23:56,025
What do you think you're doing now?

373
00:23:56,612 --> 00:23:59,399
I want him to get used
to the shop, don't I?

374
00:24:01,617 --> 00:24:02,991
Stop the dog!

375
00:24:03,242 --> 00:24:04,440
Come back!

376
00:24:05,202 --> 00:24:06,447
All right, Boris?

377
00:24:07,413 --> 00:24:10,497
- Don't worry about the dog.
- I'm not.

378
00:24:11,917 --> 00:24:13,292
What can I do for you?

379
00:24:14,294 --> 00:24:15,835
I have a job for you.

380
00:24:16,086 --> 00:24:17,794
I already have a job.

381
00:24:18,714 --> 00:24:21,501
Fifty grand for half a day's work.

382
00:24:22,801 --> 00:24:23,880
Go on.

383
00:24:24,135 --> 00:24:27,421
I want you to hold up a bookies.

384
00:24:32,349 --> 00:24:33,974
From Russia with love, eh?

385
00:24:34,852 --> 00:24:37,058
I have stones to sell...

386
00:24:37,312 --> 00:24:40,432
...fat to chew and many men
to see about many ducks...

387
00:24:40,690 --> 00:24:42,231
...so if I am not rushing you...

388
00:24:42,983 --> 00:24:46,268
Slow down, Franky, my son.
When in Rome.

389
00:24:47,237 --> 00:24:49,810
I am not in Rome, Doug.

390
00:24:50,073 --> 00:24:51,733
I am in a rush.

391
00:24:52,242 --> 00:24:53,617
I got to make the bookies.

392
00:24:53,868 --> 00:24:55,066
Bookies?

393
00:24:56,286 --> 00:24:58,325
- What are you betting on?
- Bomber Harris.

394
00:24:59,914 --> 00:25:01,539
The unlicensed boxer?

395
00:25:04,293 --> 00:25:06,251
Do you know something that I don't?

396
00:25:07,004 --> 00:25:11,416
Bubbe, I probably know
a lot you don't.

397
00:25:13,051 --> 00:25:15,339
He's bad to the bone,
ain't you, Tyrone?

398
00:25:15,595 --> 00:25:16,793
Of course I am.

399
00:25:17,054 --> 00:25:20,838
Tyrone'll drive for us. He's
done a rally driving course.

400
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:22,297
Of course I have.

401
00:25:25,102 --> 00:25:27,889
I don't want that dog
dribbling on my seats.

402
00:25:28,147 --> 00:25:29,641
Your seats?

403
00:25:29,899 --> 00:25:32,140
Tyrone, this is a stolen car, mate.

404
00:25:32,484 --> 00:25:34,311
While I'm at the wheel, it's my car...

405
00:25:34,570 --> 00:25:38,945
...so stop that dog dribbling
on my seats. All right?

406
00:25:39,198 --> 00:25:42,068
I can't believe you found it.
Where'd it go?

407
00:25:42,326 --> 00:25:44,033
It went back to the gyppos.

408
00:25:44,286 --> 00:25:46,990
Shut up.
And how could it find them?

409
00:25:47,289 --> 00:25:50,491
Well, I don't know.
I'm not a dog, Sol.

410
00:25:51,041 --> 00:25:52,369
Ask him.

411
00:25:53,418 --> 00:25:55,292
It's like he's
a fucking homing beacon.

412
00:25:57,213 --> 00:25:58,411
Steady on the brakes.

413
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:00,918
I thought you said
he could drive, Sol.

414
00:26:01,217 --> 00:26:04,964
Don't worry about me. Just worry
about that dog on my seats.

415
00:26:05,262 --> 00:26:06,720
All right?

416
00:26:27,448 --> 00:26:28,479
What?

417
00:26:29,073 --> 00:26:32,608
You said he was a getaway driver.
What the fuck can he get away from?

418
00:26:32,868 --> 00:26:35,703
Don't worry about Tyrone.
He can move when he has to.

419
00:26:35,955 --> 00:26:37,497
Worry about getting us a gun.

420
00:26:42,793 --> 00:26:43,872
What's that?

421
00:26:44,837 --> 00:26:47,375
This is a shotgun, Sol.

422
00:26:47,631 --> 00:26:50,418
It's a fucking
anti-aircraft gun, Vincent.

423
00:26:50,676 --> 00:26:54,625
- I want to raise pulses, don't I?
- You'll raise hell, never mind pulses.

424
00:27:13,028 --> 00:27:15,353
That does not look like a bookies.

425
00:27:15,655 --> 00:27:19,818
Why'd we stop here? What's the
matter with that space over there?

426
00:27:20,201 --> 00:27:21,944
It's too tight.

427
00:27:22,702 --> 00:27:24,077
Too tight?

428
00:27:25,121 --> 00:27:27,244
You could land a
jumbo-fucking-jet in there.

429
00:27:27,498 --> 00:27:31,709
Leave him alone.
He's a natural. Ain't you, Tyrone?

430
00:27:32,002 --> 00:27:33,544
Of course I am.

431
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:47,716
A natural fucking idiot.
Tyrone, what've you done?

432
00:27:48,016 --> 00:27:50,008
Yeah, Tyrone, what have you done?

433
00:27:50,309 --> 00:27:53,061
Look, you hassle me,
you see what happens.

434
00:27:53,312 --> 00:27:55,719
It's all right.
No, don't move it now.

435
00:27:55,981 --> 00:27:58,602
People'll see the damage.
Why'd you do that?

436
00:27:58,859 --> 00:27:59,854
I didn't see it.

437
00:28:00,110 --> 00:28:04,189
It's a four-ton truck. It's not like
it's a packet of fucking peanuts.

438
00:28:04,446 --> 00:28:05,940
It was at a funny angle.

439
00:28:08,492 --> 00:28:09,986
It's behind you, Tyrone.

440
00:28:10,243 --> 00:28:12,651
Whenever you reverse,
things come from behind you.

441
00:28:13,328 --> 00:28:15,617
Control that dog as well.

442
00:28:16,330 --> 00:28:18,655
- Get that dog off him.
- Get it off me.

443
00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:23,453
Give me that squeaky toy.
It shut him up last time.

444
00:28:27,382 --> 00:28:28,378
Don't snatch.

445
00:28:30,634 --> 00:28:32,258
He can't swallow the whole ball.

446
00:28:35,138 --> 00:28:36,301
Yeah.

447
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:40,844
Why the fuck...

448
00:28:41,144 --> 00:28:43,431
...did you put Gorgeous George...

449
00:28:43,728 --> 00:28:46,350
...into a bare-knuckle boxing match...

450
00:28:46,648 --> 00:28:48,889
...two days before
he had to fight The Bomber?

451
00:28:49,150 --> 00:28:52,435
He was half his size.
I didn't expect him to get hurt.

452
00:28:52,695 --> 00:28:56,857
You put the man into
a bare-knuckle boxing match.

453
00:28:57,365 --> 00:28:59,523
What the fuck did you expect?

454
00:28:59,867 --> 00:29:02,109
A grease-down and a shiatsu?

455
00:29:02,370 --> 00:29:04,777
Who took the jam out of your doughnut?

456
00:29:05,081 --> 00:29:07,488
You took the fucking jam
out of my doughnut.

457
00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:09,124
You did.

458
00:29:12,253 --> 00:29:13,284
You said get a good deal.

459
00:29:13,546 --> 00:29:16,083
I fail to recognize
the correlation...

460
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:19,424
...between losing 10 grand,
hospitalizing Gorgeous...

461
00:29:19,676 --> 00:29:20,957
...and a good deal.

462
00:29:21,553 --> 00:29:23,426
How'll we explain this to Brick Top?

463
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:25,470
That his fight won't happen?

464
00:29:26,223 --> 00:29:27,421
We replace the fighter.

465
00:29:27,683 --> 00:29:29,509
Oh, and hope he doesn't notice?

466
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:31,642
Who the fuck will we
replace him with?

467
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:33,646
What about John The Gun?

468
00:29:34,898 --> 00:29:36,355
Or Mad Fist Willy?

469
00:29:36,815 --> 00:29:38,808
You're not Mr. Current Affairs,
are you?

470
00:29:39,401 --> 00:29:41,061
Mad Fist went mad...

471
00:29:41,611 --> 00:29:43,936
...and The Gun shot himself.

472
00:29:49,035 --> 00:29:50,148
Jesus.

473
00:29:54,289 --> 00:29:55,071
What?

474
00:29:55,331 --> 00:29:57,288
Let's use the fucking pikey.

475
00:29:59,001 --> 00:30:01,041
- How much you gonna pay us?
- 10 K.

476
00:30:01,295 --> 00:30:04,627
Me bollocks. Lose more
than that running for the bus.

477
00:30:12,847 --> 00:30:13,961
All right.

478
00:30:15,307 --> 00:30:17,180
I'll do it for a caravan.

479
00:30:18,059 --> 00:30:19,007
A what?

480
00:30:19,268 --> 00:30:20,431
A caravan.

481
00:30:20,686 --> 00:30:24,269
- Top of the range and all that.
- It was us that wanted a caravan.

482
00:30:24,898 --> 00:30:26,938
Anyway, what's wrong with this one?

483
00:30:27,192 --> 00:30:29,267
It's not for me.
It's for me ma.

484
00:30:31,236 --> 00:30:32,150
Your what?

485
00:30:32,404 --> 00:30:33,519
His ma.

486
00:31:00,762 --> 00:31:03,169
<i>Brick Top runs an illegal bookies.</i>

487
00:31:03,431 --> 00:31:06,930
<i>They take bets on anything
that involves blood and pain.</i>

488
00:31:07,184 --> 00:31:08,560
<i>Now I'm changing fighters...</i>

489
00:31:09,310 --> 00:31:12,228
<i>... and Brick Top's gonna
exploit the situation.</i>

490
00:31:12,522 --> 00:31:15,143
<i>He's gonna pull my pants down,
grease me up...</i>

491
00:31:15,399 --> 00:31:17,641
<i>... and aim for penetration.</i>

492
00:31:17,943 --> 00:31:20,102
<i>If I didn't have
the replacement pikey...</i>

493
00:31:20,362 --> 00:31:22,650
<i>... he'd want to split me in half.</i>

494
00:31:26,409 --> 00:31:28,734
They could charm the paint off walls,
these fellas.

495
00:31:36,792 --> 00:31:39,034
Look mean now,
you hairy fucker, won't you?

496
00:31:40,879 --> 00:31:43,168
Shits himself when
you put him in the ring.

497
00:31:43,423 --> 00:31:45,996
Poke him with a stick,
you watch his bollocks grow.

498
00:31:46,968 --> 00:31:48,795
Do you like a dog fight, Turkish?

499
00:31:50,095 --> 00:31:51,886
We've lost Gorgeous George.

500
00:31:55,976 --> 00:31:57,885
You're gonna have to repeat that.

501
00:31:58,728 --> 00:32:00,969
We've lost Gorgeous George.

502
00:32:01,563 --> 00:32:03,436
Well, where'd you lose him?

503
00:32:03,731 --> 00:32:06,222
He ain't a set
of fucking car keys, is he?

504
00:32:06,525 --> 00:32:09,146
And it's not as if he's
incon-fucking-spicuous, is it?

505
00:32:09,403 --> 00:32:10,351
We're not backing out.

506
00:32:10,612 --> 00:32:13,529
You bet your bollocks to
a barn dance you're not.

507
00:32:13,782 --> 00:32:15,192
We're changing the fighter.

508
00:32:17,326 --> 00:32:20,030
Oh, fuck me,
your lady friend got a voice?

509
00:32:20,287 --> 00:32:22,445
Who are you changing him to,
sweetheart?

510
00:32:22,747 --> 00:32:25,036
You won't know him, but he's mustard.

511
00:32:25,291 --> 00:32:26,322
Mustard?

512
00:32:26,584 --> 00:32:30,283
I don't care if he's
Muhammad "I'm Hard" Bruce Lee...

513
00:32:30,587 --> 00:32:31,962
...you can't change fighters.

514
00:32:32,213 --> 00:32:34,372
- You've still got your fight.
- No.

515
00:32:34,632 --> 00:32:37,835
I lose all bets at the bookies.
You can't change fighters.

516
00:32:38,094 --> 00:32:41,878
So, no, I don't have my fight,
do I, you fucking prat?

517
00:32:42,139 --> 00:32:43,846
You can take bets at the fight.

518
00:32:44,307 --> 00:32:46,714
Put a lead on her, Turkish,
before she gets bitten.

519
00:32:46,976 --> 00:32:49,265
Do you want to get bitten, sweetheart?

520
00:32:54,942 --> 00:32:57,313
Make sure your man goes down
in the fourth.

521
00:32:57,902 --> 00:33:00,903
You understand me now,
don't you, Turkish?

522
00:33:02,448 --> 00:33:04,773
<i>This is the one place
I didn't want to be:</i>

523
00:33:05,033 --> 00:33:06,278
<i>In his debt.</i>

524
00:33:06,618 --> 00:33:09,109
<i>Which now means I'm in his pocket.</i>

525
00:33:09,371 --> 00:33:12,157
You're on thin-fucking-ice,
my pedigree chums.

526
00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:15,078
And I shall be under it
when it breaks.

527
00:33:16,376 --> 00:33:17,574
Now, fuck off.

528
00:33:26,259 --> 00:33:29,094
Doug, where's Franky Four Fingers?

529
00:33:29,387 --> 00:33:32,554
I don't know. I'm not his mother.
But I'm seeing him later.

530
00:33:32,807 --> 00:33:35,380
- When later?
- He said he wanted cash.

531
00:33:35,685 --> 00:33:38,638
So he's coming back
after he's been to a fight.

532
00:33:45,234 --> 00:33:46,609
A fight?

533
00:33:46,986 --> 00:33:51,148
What do you mean, a fight?
A boxing match?

534
00:33:51,698 --> 00:33:56,075
- Is there gambling involved?
- It's a boxing match, Avi.

535
00:33:56,327 --> 00:33:58,818
- Did he have a case with him?
- Yes, he had a case.

536
00:33:59,079 --> 00:34:00,787
And this schmuck is gambling?

537
00:34:01,081 --> 00:34:05,658
You're talking about Franky "I've got
a problem with gambling" Four Fingers.

538
00:34:05,918 --> 00:34:07,496
Avi, I'm not telepathic.

539
00:34:07,753 --> 00:34:09,829
You're plenty stupid,
I'll give you that.

540
00:34:10,130 --> 00:34:12,704
Do you know why they call him
Franky Four Fingers?

541
00:34:12,966 --> 00:34:14,295
I have no idea.

542
00:34:14,551 --> 00:34:17,670
Because he makes stupid bets
with dangerous people.

543
00:34:17,970 --> 00:34:20,591
When he doesn't pay up,
they give him the chop.

544
00:34:20,889 --> 00:34:22,798
And I'm not talking about
his fucking foreskin.

545
00:34:23,058 --> 00:34:24,469
I'm sure he can pay.

546
00:34:24,768 --> 00:34:28,433
Not with my goods. Got a toothbrush?
We're going to London.

547
00:34:28,730 --> 00:34:31,017
Do you hear that?
I'm coming to London!

548
00:34:35,777 --> 00:34:38,813
- Avi!
- Shut up and sit down, you bald fuck!

549
00:34:41,491 --> 00:34:43,648
I don't like leaving my own country...

550
00:34:43,908 --> 00:34:48,036
...especially leaving it for anything
less than warm, sandy beaches...

551
00:34:48,288 --> 00:34:50,825
...and cocktails
with little straw hats.

552
00:34:51,624 --> 00:34:53,367
We've got sandy beaches.

553
00:34:53,626 --> 00:34:55,453
So who the fuck wants to see them?

554
00:34:55,711 --> 00:34:59,577
I hope you can appreciate the concern
I have for my friend Franky.

555
00:34:59,839 --> 00:35:02,164
I'll find him,
and you'll help me find him.

556
00:35:02,466 --> 00:35:04,340
And we'll start at that fight.

557
00:35:06,595 --> 00:35:08,422
How am I gonna get it out?

558
00:35:08,931 --> 00:35:10,388
It will probably cough it up.

559
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:11,884
Will he be all right?

560
00:35:12,224 --> 00:35:13,422
I hope not.

561
00:35:13,684 --> 00:35:16,804
- Are we gonna rob this bookies?
- Yes, big man.

562
00:35:17,062 --> 00:35:18,093
Why are we waiting?

563
00:35:18,397 --> 00:35:22,097
We are waiting for a man with
four fingers, carrying a briefcase.

564
00:35:22,359 --> 00:35:23,140
And why's that?

565
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:28,276
Because the deal is, the Russian
gets the case, we get the money.

566
00:35:28,530 --> 00:35:29,989
What's in the case?

567
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:34,487
For fuck's sake, Tyrone, just
concentrate on the steering wheel.

568
00:35:36,246 --> 00:35:37,240
Jesus.

569
00:35:37,496 --> 00:35:40,746
- Private night tonight, chaps.
- I'm well aware of that, my son.

570
00:35:40,999 --> 00:35:42,707
That's why we're here.

571
00:35:43,752 --> 00:35:45,660
Well done. This is the back way in.

572
00:35:45,961 --> 00:35:48,962
Oh, really?
I thought it was the front.

573
00:35:49,838 --> 00:35:53,005
- Private night tonight, chaps.
- We know. That's why we're here.

574
00:35:53,675 --> 00:35:54,790
Tickets.

575
00:35:55,093 --> 00:35:57,418
Are we ever gonna get into this place?

576
00:35:57,721 --> 00:36:00,556
Avi, Avi, you gotta understand.

577
00:36:00,849 --> 00:36:03,635
This ain't exactly Vegas,
and this ain't exactly legal.

578
00:36:03,892 --> 00:36:06,727
I'm not looking for Vegas
or for legal.

579
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:08,763
I'm looking for Franky.

580
00:36:09,064 --> 00:36:12,563
I know that,
and he said he's gonna be here.

581
00:36:12,859 --> 00:36:15,563
- Lf there's gambling, he'll be here.
- Let's not have a fuck-up.

582
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:17,147
You won't let us down.

583
00:36:17,445 --> 00:36:21,312
He's going down in the fourth,
don't you worry about that.

584
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:26,115
Is that him?

585
00:36:26,370 --> 00:36:28,529
I don't know.
How many fingers did he have?

586
00:36:28,789 --> 00:36:30,828
Sorry, I didn't get
the binoculars out in time.

587
00:36:31,082 --> 00:36:33,833
Let's not stand on ceremony.
Let's start the show.

588
00:36:50,057 --> 00:36:51,765
Do you know who
this bookies belongs to?

589
00:36:52,017 --> 00:36:55,018
If you know what's good for you
you'll give me everything...

590
00:37:00,566 --> 00:37:02,024
What are you doing?

591
00:37:02,275 --> 00:37:04,647
What does it look like
I'm doing up here?

592
00:37:06,863 --> 00:37:09,698
This is starting to hurt, Solomon.

593
00:37:09,990 --> 00:37:12,232
Drop the screen now.

594
00:37:15,453 --> 00:37:16,532
How you doing, Vince?

595
00:37:16,788 --> 00:37:19,160
I'd do a lot better
if you'd stop using my name.

596
00:37:19,415 --> 00:37:21,455
- Fill that bag.
- All bets are off.

597
00:37:22,043 --> 00:37:25,457
I am not in here
to make a fucking bet.

598
00:37:25,712 --> 00:37:26,874
Appreciated...

599
00:37:27,130 --> 00:37:29,003
...but all bets...

600
00:37:30,550 --> 00:37:31,925
...are...

601
00:37:32,218 --> 00:37:33,332
...off.

602
00:37:34,678 --> 00:37:38,011
If all bets are off, then there
can't be any money, can there?

603
00:37:39,474 --> 00:37:41,596
I ain't fucking buying that.

604
00:37:41,892 --> 00:37:45,308
That's handy because I ain't
fucking selling it. It's a fact.

605
00:37:46,355 --> 00:37:47,730
What have you got?

606
00:37:49,525 --> 00:37:51,066
Nothing, really.

607
00:37:53,152 --> 00:37:54,646
A few coins, but no notes.

608
00:37:57,531 --> 00:37:58,480
Show me your hands.

609
00:38:01,118 --> 00:38:02,316
You've got five fingers.

610
00:38:05,704 --> 00:38:06,700
Copper coins.

611
00:38:07,706 --> 00:38:10,541
What do you mean,
copper-fucking-coins?

612
00:38:19,341 --> 00:38:23,124
It won't open
because it's a security door.

613
00:38:23,386 --> 00:38:24,501
Hold that.

614
00:38:33,603 --> 00:38:34,978
My leg.

615
00:38:37,732 --> 00:38:41,432
What are you moaning about?
It didn't even touch it.

616
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:51,360
We're fucked.

617
00:38:58,499 --> 00:39:00,741
What the fuck are you two doing?

618
00:39:05,214 --> 00:39:06,293
Get us out of here.

619
00:39:12,344 --> 00:39:14,917
Tyrone, what are you doing?
Get us out of here!

620
00:39:22,645 --> 00:39:25,349
Who the fuck is this man, Tyrone?

621
00:39:28,692 --> 00:39:32,024
He's a man with four fingers
and a briefcase, Vinny.

622
00:39:34,237 --> 00:39:35,731
In the red corner...

623
00:39:36,031 --> 00:39:38,485
...we have the young
and unchallenged...

624
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:42,987
So, Mickey, you're going down
in the fourth. Is that clear?

625
00:39:43,286 --> 00:39:44,911
Just make sure he doesn't kill me.

626
00:39:45,580 --> 00:39:48,996
So give it up
for the bone-crunching...

627
00:39:49,250 --> 00:39:51,372
...one-punch machine gun...

628
00:39:51,668 --> 00:39:53,495
...Mickey!

629
00:39:58,591 --> 00:40:00,749
And in the other corner...

630
00:40:02,094 --> 00:40:04,169
Now, I know he looks
like a fat fucker...

631
00:40:04,471 --> 00:40:07,341
Well, he is a fat fucker,
but he's dirty and he's dangerous.

632
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:12,426
Bomber "The Mad Man" Harris!

633
00:40:15,147 --> 00:40:17,222
Now, try and look like a fighter.

634
00:40:17,482 --> 00:40:19,937
Let's get ready...

635
00:40:20,193 --> 00:40:22,268
...to rumble!

636
00:40:55,974 --> 00:40:59,472
Do you realize I'm
fucking forty grand down?

637
00:40:59,768 --> 00:41:00,930
What's the fucking crack?

638
00:41:01,186 --> 00:41:03,855
- I'll make it up to you.
- I ain't happy.

639
00:41:04,147 --> 00:41:07,516
I'll make it up to you, I promise.
Stand on me.

640
00:41:07,775 --> 00:41:10,810
Oh, that fucking pikey's
put me in it.

641
00:41:12,612 --> 00:41:14,735
Thanks for the tip, Brick Top.

642
00:41:14,989 --> 00:41:18,073
Listen, you fucking fringe,
if I throw a dog a bone...

643
00:41:18,326 --> 00:41:19,736
...I don't want to know
if it tastes good.

644
00:41:19,994 --> 00:41:24,987
Stop me again whilst I'm walking and
I'll cut your fucking jacobs off.

645
00:41:46,850 --> 00:41:49,720
- He's here.
- Well, you explain it to him.

646
00:41:57,025 --> 00:41:59,694
- What you doing?
- The case was attached to his arm.

647
00:41:59,986 --> 00:42:02,311
So why didn't you chop it off?

648
00:42:02,614 --> 00:42:04,819
We ain't fucking butchers, Boris.

649
00:42:05,115 --> 00:42:06,395
But he has the case.

650
00:42:06,658 --> 00:42:09,279
Look, we...
Well, you have a problem.

651
00:42:10,370 --> 00:42:12,777
There weren't much cash
at the bookies.

652
00:42:13,748 --> 00:42:14,910
Okay.

653
00:42:16,250 --> 00:42:17,827
Here is the 10 grand.

654
00:42:18,126 --> 00:42:20,996
No. Keep it. We want this.

655
00:42:21,421 --> 00:42:23,911
Well, at least half of this.

656
00:42:24,465 --> 00:42:27,003
What was in the case was mine.

657
00:42:27,259 --> 00:42:30,544
What was in the bookies was yours.
Okay?

658
00:42:30,845 --> 00:42:34,629
It wasn't much, but here is
the 10 large to help the situation.

659
00:42:34,932 --> 00:42:36,640
No, I'm afraid
it's too late for that.

660
00:42:36,892 --> 00:42:40,391
We want half of this, and that's
because we're being generous.

661
00:42:40,687 --> 00:42:44,731
We could, by all rights, keep
the whole fucking stone, Boris.

662
00:42:54,407 --> 00:42:55,736
Watch out!

663
00:42:58,160 --> 00:42:59,903
Drop the gun, fat boy.

664
00:43:03,790 --> 00:43:07,408
You fucking idiots.
He could not know my name.

665
00:43:08,586 --> 00:43:10,246
Give me the stone.

666
00:43:11,338 --> 00:43:13,793
- It's in the case.
- What?

667
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:16,212
It's in the case.

668
00:43:16,467 --> 00:43:18,044
You put the stone in the case?

669
00:43:19,511 --> 00:43:21,089
Open it and give me the stone.

670
00:43:22,305 --> 00:43:26,218
The only man who knew
the combination, you just shot.

671
00:43:55,917 --> 00:43:59,748
<i>Now, it's not too clever to hang
about after Mickey's performance.</i>

672
00:44:00,004 --> 00:44:04,960
<i>Brick Top, in short, will be looking
to kill Tommy, Mickey and myself.</i>

673
00:44:05,216 --> 00:44:08,798
<i>I know he's looking for us,
but I don't have a choice.</i>

674
00:44:09,637 --> 00:44:13,717
<i>I'm happy to leave the country,
but I need money to do so.</i>

675
00:44:13,974 --> 00:44:17,757
<i>But any money I have is in the safe,
which is in the office.</i>

676
00:44:18,018 --> 00:44:19,726
<i>Once I have that, it's...</i>

677
00:44:20,020 --> 00:44:21,051
Oink, oink.

678
00:44:21,772 --> 00:44:22,934
Shit.

679
00:44:25,233 --> 00:44:27,025
So that's where you keep the sugar.

680
00:44:28,862 --> 00:44:31,815
What brings you two here?
Run out of pants to sniff?

681
00:44:33,532 --> 00:44:35,275
That sounds like hostility,
doesn't it?

682
00:44:35,534 --> 00:44:37,859
And we don't like hostility,
do we, Errol?

683
00:44:38,787 --> 00:44:40,067
No, we don't, John.

684
00:44:52,048 --> 00:44:54,124
I just had them polished.

685
00:44:59,846 --> 00:45:01,803
Go and put the kettle on.

686
00:45:05,267 --> 00:45:08,683
- You take sugar?
- No, thank you, Turkish.

687
00:45:09,521 --> 00:45:11,312
I'm sweet enough.

688
00:45:20,114 --> 00:45:22,106
He's now your problem.

689
00:45:23,617 --> 00:45:24,814
Okay?

690
00:45:32,791 --> 00:45:36,871
You can keep the 10 grand,
along with the body...

691
00:45:37,128 --> 00:45:40,247
...but if I see you again,
you motherfuckers...

692
00:45:43,550 --> 00:45:44,925
Well, look at him.

693
00:45:52,140 --> 00:45:55,307
I've got a bare-knuckle fight
in a couple of days.

694
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:56,723
I want to use the pikey.

695
00:45:58,313 --> 00:45:59,641
All right. Of course.

696
00:45:59,939 --> 00:46:02,145
Of course, fucking of course.

697
00:46:02,441 --> 00:46:04,848
I wasn't asking, I was telling.

698
00:46:05,944 --> 00:46:07,023
But this time...

699
00:46:07,862 --> 00:46:11,646
...I do want him to go down
in the fourth.

700
00:46:12,616 --> 00:46:16,661
And I do mean it, this time.

701
00:46:27,212 --> 00:46:30,462
Now, I know you come back here
to open your safe.

702
00:46:32,758 --> 00:46:34,834
So now you can open it.

703
00:46:35,219 --> 00:46:37,544
Turkish has been a busy
little bastard.

704
00:46:37,804 --> 00:46:39,548
I think he's got away with enough.

705
00:46:39,848 --> 00:46:43,845
Thinking can get you into trouble,
Errol. I shouldn't do so much of it.

706
00:46:44,143 --> 00:46:46,016
That takes care of one little piggy.

707
00:46:46,270 --> 00:46:49,104
Now find me the silly sods
who blagged the bookies.

708
00:46:49,397 --> 00:46:50,595
Find them today.

709
00:47:09,623 --> 00:47:12,077
Top of the morning
to you, Mrs. O'Neil.

710
00:47:12,916 --> 00:47:13,995
Tommy.

711
00:47:15,293 --> 00:47:18,543
You're a snake in the grass,
ain't you? Where'd they come from?

712
00:47:18,797 --> 00:47:21,038
You're looking for my boy, are you?

713
00:47:21,299 --> 00:47:23,754
- Do you know where I can find him?
- Yeah.

714
00:47:25,010 --> 00:47:26,967
Would you like
to share that information?

715
00:47:27,220 --> 00:47:29,628
I don't want you getting
my boy into trouble.

716
00:47:30,890 --> 00:47:34,140
He's my only boy.
And he's a good boy.

717
00:47:35,811 --> 00:47:37,092
He's coursing.

718
00:47:39,397 --> 00:47:40,939
What's coursing?

719
00:47:41,482 --> 00:47:42,396
Hare coursing.

720
00:47:43,276 --> 00:47:47,190
They set two lurchers...
They're dogs, before you ask.

721
00:47:48,072 --> 00:47:49,649
On a hare.

722
00:47:50,324 --> 00:47:53,359
And the hare has to outrun the dogs.

723
00:47:53,617 --> 00:47:55,657
So, what if it doesn't?

724
00:47:56,996 --> 00:48:00,447
Well, the big rabbit gets fucked,
doesn't it?

725
00:48:04,044 --> 00:48:05,667
Proper fucked?

726
00:48:06,378 --> 00:48:07,707
Yeah, Tommy.

727
00:48:08,130 --> 00:48:10,336
Before "zee" Germans get there.

728
00:48:13,635 --> 00:48:14,915
Do you know these tits, Errol?

729
00:48:15,011 --> 00:48:16,387
I know a lot of tits...

730
00:48:16,471 --> 00:48:19,175
...but I don't know any
as fucking stupid as these two.

731
00:48:19,473 --> 00:48:20,635
John?

732
00:48:21,767 --> 00:48:23,142
I can't help, guv.

733
00:48:28,022 --> 00:48:29,303
Tyrone.

734
00:48:29,565 --> 00:48:32,399
You silly, fat bastard.

735
00:48:33,902 --> 00:48:35,693
- Do you want to do it?
- That depends.

736
00:48:35,945 --> 00:48:36,894
On what?

737
00:48:37,155 --> 00:48:40,025
On you buying this caravan.

738
00:48:40,283 --> 00:48:42,655
Not the rouge one. The rose.

739
00:48:43,202 --> 00:48:45,407
- It's not the same caravan.
- Not the same fight.

740
00:48:45,662 --> 00:48:47,619
It's twice the size of the last one.

741
00:48:47,872 --> 00:48:50,826
The fight is twice the size.
And me ma needs a caravan.

742
00:48:51,083 --> 00:48:54,037
I like to look after me ma.
It's a fair deal. Take it.

743
00:48:54,295 --> 00:48:58,208
You're lucky we aren't worm food
after your last performance.

744
00:48:58,673 --> 00:49:01,792
Buying a tart's mobile palace
is a little fucking rich.

745
00:49:04,678 --> 00:49:07,679
I wasn't calling your mum a tart.
I just meant...

746
00:49:08,015 --> 00:49:10,221
Save your breath for cooling
your porridge.

747
00:49:18,231 --> 00:49:22,359
Right. And she's terrible
partial to the periwinkle blue.

748
00:49:24,611 --> 00:49:26,022
Have I made myself clear?

749
00:49:28,115 --> 00:49:30,487
Yeah, that's perfectly clear, Mickey.

750
00:49:30,825 --> 00:49:34,028
Just give me one minute
to confer with my colleague.

751
00:49:38,707 --> 00:49:40,913
Did you understand a word
of what he said?

752
00:49:43,753 --> 00:49:44,951
I'll tell you what.

753
00:49:46,756 --> 00:49:47,870
Fucker.

754
00:49:48,466 --> 00:49:49,960
I'll bet you for it.

755
00:49:50,551 --> 00:49:51,546
You'll what?

756
00:49:51,801 --> 00:49:53,081
He'll bet you for it.

757
00:49:53,636 --> 00:49:56,590
What, like Tommy did last time?
Do me a favour?

758
00:49:56,847 --> 00:49:58,306
I'll do you a favour.

759
00:49:58,557 --> 00:50:01,227
You have first bet.
If I win, I get a caravan...

760
00:50:01,477 --> 00:50:03,553
...and the boys get
a pair of them shoes.

761
00:50:05,688 --> 00:50:07,431
If I lose...

762
00:50:09,650 --> 00:50:12,651
...fuck it, I'll do the fight
for free.

763
00:50:14,571 --> 00:50:17,442
<i>The last thing I really
want to do is bet a pikey.</i>

764
00:50:17,698 --> 00:50:19,821
<i>However, I don't really
have much of a choice.</i>

765
00:50:20,492 --> 00:50:23,695
<i>Somehow I've got to get him to fight,
but if I lose...</i>

766
00:50:23,954 --> 00:50:27,038
<i>Well, I don't even want
to think about losing.</i>

767
00:50:27,666 --> 00:50:31,283
Okay. I reckon the hare gets fucked.

768
00:50:31,543 --> 00:50:33,500
What? Proper fucked?

769
00:50:35,797 --> 00:50:37,457
You got that, London?

770
00:50:37,716 --> 00:50:38,711
We're on!

771
00:51:51,001 --> 00:51:53,836
I'll fucking tell you!
Get those off me.

772
00:51:54,505 --> 00:51:56,212
I'll tell you
who robbed your bookies.

773
00:52:13,272 --> 00:52:15,941
Periwinkle blue. Bye, boys.

774
00:52:17,943 --> 00:52:20,315
Who's proper fucked now, then?

775
00:52:22,030 --> 00:52:24,153
There's something very wrong
with this.

776
00:52:24,449 --> 00:52:27,652
It was us that wanted
to buy a caravan off of him.

777
00:52:28,494 --> 00:52:33,037
Well, why didn't you "bust a cap
in his ass" then, Tommy?

778
00:52:33,583 --> 00:52:36,749
Mind you, you'd do more damage
if you threw it at him.

779
00:52:37,002 --> 00:52:39,493
What? You saying I can't shoot?

780
00:52:39,755 --> 00:52:43,289
Oh, no, Tommy.
I wasn't saying you can't shoot.

781
00:52:43,592 --> 00:52:45,383
I know you can't shoot.

782
00:52:45,677 --> 00:52:49,971
What we're saying is, that piece
of shit stuck in your trousers...

783
00:52:50,265 --> 00:52:52,174
...would do more damage
if you fed it to him.

784
00:52:52,433 --> 00:52:53,927
You saying the gun don't work?

785
00:52:54,227 --> 00:52:55,507
You tried it?

786
00:53:00,983 --> 00:53:01,813
Whoops.

787
00:53:04,319 --> 00:53:07,356
I want to see
that sneaky fucking Russian.

788
00:53:07,823 --> 00:53:10,278
Why's he got a tea cosy on his head?

789
00:53:10,575 --> 00:53:12,449
To keep his head warm.

790
00:53:12,702 --> 00:53:15,158
- What happened to him?
- He got shot in the face.

791
00:53:15,413 --> 00:53:16,824
I thought that was obvious.

792
00:53:17,081 --> 00:53:19,406
What'd you do that for?
You mistake him for a rabbit?

793
00:53:19,667 --> 00:53:22,122
- What do you want me to do?
- Sort it out.

794
00:53:22,378 --> 00:53:25,213
- I'm not a witch doctor.
- But you are a bad boy yardie...

795
00:53:25,464 --> 00:53:28,299
...and bad boy yardies should know how
to get rid of bodies.

796
00:53:28,550 --> 00:53:31,302
I create the bodies,
I don't erase the bodies.

797
00:53:38,142 --> 00:53:39,387
We're in, governor.

798
00:53:41,437 --> 00:53:43,228
Goody gumdrops.

799
00:53:43,564 --> 00:53:45,853
Get us a cup of tea,
would you, Errol?

800
00:53:47,735 --> 00:53:48,730
Grab hold of his legs.

801
00:53:48,986 --> 00:53:51,856
What do you think
I'm gonna grab him by, his ears?

802
00:54:02,332 --> 00:54:04,953
Hope this is not a bad moment.

803
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:11,161
Do you know who I am?

804
00:54:13,675 --> 00:54:15,004
I do.

805
00:54:22,100 --> 00:54:25,136
Good. That will save me
some time, then.

806
00:54:26,854 --> 00:54:28,348
Well, I don't.

807
00:54:36,112 --> 00:54:40,572
You're always gonna have problems
lifting a body in one piece.

808
00:54:40,991 --> 00:54:42,984
Apparently, the best thing to do...

809
00:54:43,285 --> 00:54:47,911
...is cut up a corpse into six pieces
and pile it all together.

810
00:54:48,832 --> 00:54:51,405
Would someone mind telling me,
who are you?

811
00:54:51,668 --> 00:54:54,585
When you got your six pieces,
you gotta get rid of them.

812
00:54:54,838 --> 00:54:58,289
It's no good leaving it in the freezer
for your mum to discover.

813
00:55:04,138 --> 00:55:07,672
Then I hear the best thing
to do is feed them to pigs.

814
00:55:09,268 --> 00:55:11,344
You gotta starve the pigs
for a few days...

815
00:55:11,603 --> 00:55:14,806
...then the chopped-up body
will look like curry to a pisshead.

816
00:55:16,358 --> 00:55:19,857
You gotta shave the heads of your
victims and pull the teeth out...

817
00:55:20,111 --> 00:55:21,902
...for the piggies' digestion.

818
00:55:22,196 --> 00:55:24,189
You could do this afterwards,
of course...

819
00:55:24,448 --> 00:55:26,856
...but you don't want
to sieve through pigshit, do you?

820
00:55:27,910 --> 00:55:31,742
They will go through bone like butter.

821
00:55:32,247 --> 00:55:36,031
You need at least 16 pigs
to finish the job in one sitting...

822
00:55:36,334 --> 00:55:40,284
...so be wary of any man
who keeps a pig farm.

823
00:55:40,547 --> 00:55:43,750
They will go through a body
that weighs 200 pounds...

824
00:55:44,050 --> 00:55:45,924
...in about eight minutes.

825
00:55:46,177 --> 00:55:47,754
That means that a single pig...

826
00:55:48,054 --> 00:55:51,719
...can consume two pounds
of uncooked flesh...

827
00:55:52,016 --> 00:55:53,973
...every minute.

828
00:55:54,601 --> 00:55:56,558
Hence the expression...

829
00:55:56,812 --> 00:56:00,097
..."as greedy as a pig."

830
00:56:03,943 --> 00:56:08,237
Well, thank you for that.
That's a great weight off me mind.

831
00:56:08,489 --> 00:56:11,656
Now, if you wouldn't mind telling me
who the fuck you are...

832
00:56:11,909 --> 00:56:14,779
...apart from someone who feeds people
to pigs, of course.

833
00:56:19,041 --> 00:56:20,950
Do you know what "nemesis" means?

834
00:56:25,338 --> 00:56:28,789
"A righteous infliction
of retribution...

835
00:56:29,092 --> 00:56:32,923
...manifested by an
appropriate agent."

836
00:56:33,387 --> 00:56:38,345
Personified, in this case,
by a horrible cunt:

837
00:56:38,851 --> 00:56:40,261
Me.

838
00:56:48,109 --> 00:56:49,438
Gentlemen...

839
00:57:20,348 --> 00:57:22,921
Why can't you find me Franky, Doug?

840
00:57:23,267 --> 00:57:27,727
Avi, what do you want me to do?
I'm not a bounty hunter.

841
00:57:29,439 --> 00:57:30,637
What about Tony?

842
00:57:30,899 --> 00:57:32,062
<i>Bullet-Tooth Tony.</i>

843
00:57:32,359 --> 00:57:33,189
Who's Bullet-Tooth...

844
00:57:33,443 --> 00:57:35,436
- Tony!
- You silly fuck.

845
00:57:35,695 --> 00:57:36,726
He's a liability.

846
00:57:36,988 --> 00:57:39,146
He'd find Moses and the burning bush.

847
00:57:39,407 --> 00:57:40,818
You are gonna die, Tony!

848
00:57:41,075 --> 00:57:44,278
He got shot six times,
had the bullets moulded into gold.

849
00:57:45,162 --> 00:57:46,906
I shoot you, you go down!

850
00:57:47,206 --> 00:57:49,957
He has two in his teeth
that Dad did, so he loves Dad.

851
00:57:51,043 --> 00:57:52,916
Why don't you fucking die?

852
00:57:53,170 --> 00:57:55,791
- He's the best chance you got.
- Six times?

853
00:57:57,382 --> 00:57:58,757
In one sitting.

854
00:57:59,551 --> 00:58:01,258
You're in trouble now.

855
00:58:02,929 --> 00:58:05,135
Sounds promising.
What are we waiting for?

856
00:58:17,775 --> 00:58:18,854
<i>Bonjour.</i>

857
00:58:22,321 --> 00:58:24,609
What's so fucking important?

858
00:58:24,865 --> 00:58:27,023
Why do you think
we've got a dead man...

859
00:58:27,284 --> 00:58:30,071
...missing an arm in our office?
- Talk to me, tell me.

860
00:58:30,328 --> 00:58:32,119
You give us four days...

861
00:58:32,413 --> 00:58:36,031
...I'll get you a stone the size
of a fucking home. I kid you not.

862
00:58:36,292 --> 00:58:37,490
What do you think, Errol?

863
00:58:37,793 --> 00:58:40,960
I think we should drip-dry them,
while we got the chance.

864
00:58:41,213 --> 00:58:43,420
It was a rhetorical question, Errol.

865
00:58:43,716 --> 00:58:46,289
What have I told you about thinking?

866
00:58:46,927 --> 00:58:49,085
- You got 48 hours.
- Yeah.

867
00:58:49,346 --> 00:58:52,631
You can keep that silly, fat wanker.
The lads can't lift him.

868
00:58:52,891 --> 00:58:54,089
Forty-eight hours.

869
00:58:54,392 --> 00:58:55,803
After that it's your family...

870
00:58:56,102 --> 00:58:58,889
...and the pigs finish
what the dogs don't do.

871
00:59:01,232 --> 00:59:05,276
So, what should I call you?
Should I call you "Bullet"? "Tooth"?

872
00:59:05,528 --> 00:59:07,152
Call me "Susan"
if it makes you happy.

873
00:59:07,404 --> 00:59:10,820
Tony, there is a man
I'd like you to find.

874
00:59:11,074 --> 00:59:14,739
That depends on all the elements
in the equation. How many are there?

875
00:59:14,995 --> 00:59:15,825
Forty thousand.

876
00:59:18,915 --> 00:59:20,539
Where was he last seen?

877
00:59:21,501 --> 00:59:22,366
At a bookies.

878
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:24,289
Bookies?

879
00:59:26,589 --> 00:59:28,462
Pass us the blower, Susi.

880
00:59:32,511 --> 00:59:35,595
- Bookies got blagged last night.
- Blagged? Speak English.

881
00:59:35,847 --> 00:59:40,556
This country spawned the language,
and nobody seems to speak it.

882
00:59:40,852 --> 00:59:42,180
Blagged, robbed.

883
00:59:42,437 --> 00:59:44,762
We'll see a man
that may know something.

884
00:59:45,023 --> 00:59:46,766
I need a gun.

885
00:59:47,066 --> 00:59:50,102
You don't, Rosebud, me old son.
You need me.

886
00:59:52,655 --> 00:59:54,980
I got fucking black ink all
over fuck boy.

887
00:59:55,282 --> 00:59:57,321
He's stained for fucking life.

888
00:59:57,618 --> 01:00:00,287
That and the golden teeth as well.
Fucking hell...

889
01:00:00,537 --> 01:00:01,865
All right, Mullet?

890
01:00:06,834 --> 01:00:08,578
How you doing?
You all right, mate?

891
01:00:09,420 --> 01:00:10,748
Nice tie.

892
01:00:11,005 --> 01:00:12,629
I heard you weren't about that much.

893
01:00:12,882 --> 01:00:16,085
Still warm, the blood
that courses through my veins.

894
01:00:16,844 --> 01:00:18,504
Unlike yours, Mullet.

895
01:00:19,304 --> 01:00:20,882
Who blagged Brick Top's bookies?

896
01:00:21,181 --> 01:00:24,384
- Do me a favour, Tone.
- I will do you a favour, Mullet.

897
01:00:24,643 --> 01:00:28,391
I'll not bash the fuck out of you
in front of all your girlfriends.

898
01:00:29,314 --> 01:00:32,848
Gonna make it worth my while, mate?
Jesus, you know how it is, man.

899
01:00:37,113 --> 01:00:38,690
Comfortable, Mullet?

900
01:00:39,114 --> 01:00:42,032
It's sadly ironic it's that tie
that's got you into this pickle.

901
01:00:42,284 --> 01:00:45,071
Now, you take all
the time you want, mate.

902
01:00:45,537 --> 01:00:47,364
What the fuck you doing, Tone?

903
01:00:47,622 --> 01:00:50,196
Driving down the street
with your head in my window.

904
01:00:51,042 --> 01:00:54,458
- What you think I'm doing?
- Well, don't, Tone.

905
01:00:55,630 --> 01:00:57,539
You been using dog shit
for toothpaste?

906
01:00:57,798 --> 01:00:59,043
Slow down, Tone.

907
01:00:59,341 --> 01:01:01,381
Slow down, Tony!

908
01:01:01,635 --> 01:01:04,173
I don't think so.
I think I'll speed up.

909
01:01:05,681 --> 01:01:07,673
Play some music if you like.

910
01:01:09,684 --> 01:01:10,965
I love this track.

911
01:01:12,270 --> 01:01:14,843
I want to know who blagged
Brick Top's bookies.

912
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:16,554
Yes, Mullet?

913
01:01:16,899 --> 01:01:22,238
I think it's two black guys that work
from a pawn shop in Smith Street.

914
01:01:22,530 --> 01:01:24,273
Better not be telling me porky pies.

915
01:01:24,532 --> 01:01:29,905
I tell you, it's two black guys work
out of a pawnshop on Smith Street.

916
01:01:30,412 --> 01:01:32,535
It's very effective, Tony.

917
01:01:32,831 --> 01:01:34,823
It's not too subtle, but effective.

918
01:01:36,501 --> 01:01:37,912
Are we taking him with us?

919
01:01:47,178 --> 01:01:48,292
<i>It's the Russian.</i>

920
01:01:49,430 --> 01:01:50,425
A Russian?

921
01:01:50,681 --> 01:01:53,302
To be technical he's an Uzbekistanian.

922
01:01:53,600 --> 01:01:58,096
Uzbekistanian? I've been dealing
with those sneaky Russian dogs.

923
01:01:59,022 --> 01:02:00,599
- Give me a name.
- Yurinov.

924
01:02:00,899 --> 01:02:02,227
Boris.

925
01:02:02,775 --> 01:02:04,316
- Boris The Blade?
- Yeah.

926
01:02:04,609 --> 01:02:07,444
As in Boris The Bullet-Dodger?

927
01:02:08,988 --> 01:02:11,360
Why do they call him
The Bullet-Dodger?

928
01:02:12,367 --> 01:02:14,739
Because he dodges bullets, Avi.

929
01:02:16,621 --> 01:02:19,621
<i>He won't fight unless
we buy his mum a caravan...</i>

930
01:02:19,832 --> 01:02:21,326
<i>... and you nicked all our savings.</i>

931
01:02:21,792 --> 01:02:26,003
In the quiet words
of the Virgin Mary, come again?

932
01:02:26,922 --> 01:02:30,789
He's a stubborn bastard. He said
he's got to look after his mum.

933
01:02:31,051 --> 01:02:33,376
<i>- Are you taking the piss?
- What can I do?</i>

934
01:02:33,636 --> 01:02:35,795
I can't make him do it, can I?

935
01:02:36,055 --> 01:02:39,175
You're not much good to me alive
are you, Turkish?

936
01:02:44,271 --> 01:02:48,221
He's a useless shite, that boy.
Punish him for me, Errol.

937
01:02:49,568 --> 01:02:51,774
I want that pikey to fight.

938
01:03:16,384 --> 01:03:19,504
<i>Brick Top thought smashing up
our arcade...</i>

939
01:03:19,804 --> 01:03:22,805
<i>... might help me
to persuade Mickey to fight.</i>

940
01:03:24,016 --> 01:03:25,973
<i>And if that wasn't enough...</i>

941
01:03:26,394 --> 01:03:28,682
<i>... he thought it would be
a good idea...</i>

942
01:03:29,313 --> 01:03:31,685
<i>... to burn Mickey's mum's caravan.</i>

943
01:03:33,400 --> 01:03:34,894
<i>While she was asleep in it.</i>

944
01:04:32,080 --> 01:04:34,155
Turkish, get your arse up.

945
01:04:34,874 --> 01:04:35,739
You lot...

946
01:04:36,459 --> 01:04:38,949
...follow me
and I'll fucking shoot you.

947
01:04:40,004 --> 01:04:42,874
Calm down, son. Behave yourself.

948
01:04:43,173 --> 01:04:47,087
I've got the gun, son.
I think it's you who should behave.

949
01:04:47,719 --> 01:04:48,750
What?

950
01:04:49,512 --> 01:04:51,884
You want to see
if I've got the minerals?

951
01:05:10,657 --> 01:05:11,985
Jesus.

952
01:05:12,242 --> 01:05:13,700
Sorry, Mickey.

953
01:05:15,078 --> 01:05:16,406
Did you do it?

954
01:05:21,542 --> 01:05:23,084
Then what are you sorry for?

955
01:05:24,253 --> 01:05:26,708
- What are you two doing here?
- Come back!

956
01:05:26,964 --> 01:05:29,799
- You got some tars on you.
- Fuck off, Darren.

957
01:05:30,759 --> 01:05:32,087
Fuck off!

958
01:05:39,309 --> 01:05:41,266
<i>How silly do I feel?</i>

959
01:05:41,769 --> 01:05:44,390
<i>His mum is still smoking
next to us...</i>

960
01:05:44,647 --> 01:05:46,686
<i>... and I'm asking him to fight.</i>

961
01:05:48,067 --> 01:05:50,687
I'll do the fight before he causes
any more carnage.

962
01:05:51,319 --> 01:05:53,110
<i>And if he'd said no...</i>

963
01:05:53,404 --> 01:05:55,776
<i>... it could've been
a shite sight worse.</i>

964
01:06:01,745 --> 01:06:03,287
Russians.

965
01:06:08,752 --> 01:06:10,127
Russians.

966
01:06:10,420 --> 01:06:11,830
I should've known.

967
01:06:12,088 --> 01:06:16,002
Anti-Semite, slippery Cossack sluts.

968
01:06:16,259 --> 01:06:18,298
What do you know about this goyim?

969
01:06:18,928 --> 01:06:20,552
Ex-KGB cancer.

970
01:06:21,263 --> 01:06:23,469
He was a highly trained
undercover agent.

971
01:06:23,724 --> 01:06:26,096
He'll be impossible to track down.

972
01:06:27,019 --> 01:06:28,014
Yeah.

973
01:06:28,270 --> 01:06:31,888
<i>There's a strange man who wants
to sell us an 84-carat stone.</i>

974
01:06:32,148 --> 01:06:34,686
<i>- Where's he from?
- I don't know. Hard to tell.</i>

975
01:06:34,943 --> 01:06:36,223
<i>He's got a thick Russian accent.</i>

976
01:06:48,872 --> 01:06:53,201
Well, what was I supposed to do?
He set the dogs on me. Look.

977
01:06:53,919 --> 01:06:57,418
That sneaky fucking Russian!
No wonder he didn't want to do it.

978
01:06:57,672 --> 01:07:00,127
First things first. One of us...

979
01:07:00,675 --> 01:07:05,550
...Tyrone, you go to the Russian's.
The second you see him, call us.

980
01:07:06,096 --> 01:07:07,211
Now.

981
01:07:13,061 --> 01:07:16,347
He's a right handful,
this fella, so watch out.

982
01:07:16,606 --> 01:07:19,726
I hate Russians.
I'll take care of him.

983
01:07:19,984 --> 01:07:21,644
All yours, Rosebud, old son.

984
01:07:22,612 --> 01:07:24,438
Not a problem.

985
01:07:26,282 --> 01:07:27,942
Get me to a doctor.

986
01:07:28,200 --> 01:07:30,987
Shoot that fuck!
Then, get me to a doctor.

987
01:07:31,287 --> 01:07:33,160
Okay, but first we get the stone.

988
01:07:33,413 --> 01:07:35,536
First the stone. Then a doctor.

989
01:07:35,791 --> 01:07:38,661
<i>And not just any doctor, boychik.
A nice Jewish doctor.</i>

990
01:07:38,919 --> 01:07:40,994
Find my friend a nice Jewish doctor!

991
01:07:45,133 --> 01:07:47,754
Get his keys
and find out where the stone is.

992
01:07:48,052 --> 01:07:52,429
- I think you got something to tell us.
- Take it easy, Rosebud.

993
01:07:52,681 --> 01:07:54,923
Do you want him to be able
to talk or not?

994
01:07:55,184 --> 01:07:57,556
What the fuck do you mean, replicas?

995
01:07:57,811 --> 01:08:01,394
They look the shit, don't they?
And nobody is gonna argue.

996
01:08:01,648 --> 01:08:04,317
I've got extra loud blanks,
just in case.

997
01:08:05,402 --> 01:08:08,188
In case we have
to deafen them to death?

998
01:08:13,659 --> 01:08:15,948
- Yeah.
- Boris is here.

999
01:08:16,203 --> 01:08:19,287
<i>- We're coming over. Hold him there.
- Hold on!</i>

1000
01:08:19,540 --> 01:08:20,571
He's not on his own!

1001
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:28,078
We're off.

1002
01:08:32,719 --> 01:08:35,174
Very industrious for a Cossack.

1003
01:08:43,687 --> 01:08:46,260
Sneaky fucking Russian.

1004
01:08:49,985 --> 01:08:50,980
So, where is he?

1005
01:08:51,236 --> 01:08:53,857
It's not just he.
Three fellas went in the house.

1006
01:08:54,113 --> 01:08:57,114
- They locked Boris in the car.
- Why didn't you tell us that?

1007
01:08:58,826 --> 01:08:59,857
Did they look hard?

1008
01:09:00,161 --> 01:09:01,323
They looked messy.

1009
01:09:01,579 --> 01:09:04,414
- Let's get out of here.
- What about the Russian?

1010
01:09:04,707 --> 01:09:06,450
I want you to bury him.

1011
01:09:07,084 --> 01:09:08,079
All right.

1012
01:09:09,795 --> 01:09:12,001
I think we should get you a new gun.

1013
01:09:12,297 --> 01:09:14,171
But this time, try it.

1014
01:09:14,466 --> 01:09:16,375
How far to the Russian's?

1015
01:09:16,634 --> 01:09:18,176
Be there in a minute.

1016
01:09:24,350 --> 01:09:26,591
- Come on, then.
- No, no, not so fast, Vinny.

1017
01:09:26,852 --> 01:09:29,769
We can't take them now.
We're gonna have to follow them.

1018
01:09:31,440 --> 01:09:33,895
You shouldn't drink
that stuff, anyway.

1019
01:09:34,191 --> 01:09:35,733
Why? What's wrong with it?

1020
01:09:35,985 --> 01:09:38,902
- It's not in sync with evolution.
- Shut up.

1021
01:09:39,154 --> 01:09:40,529
How do we get rid of him?

1022
01:09:40,781 --> 01:09:43,188
- Do you want to shoot him?
- It's a little noisy.

1023
01:09:43,450 --> 01:09:46,320
- Do you want to stab him?
- That's a little cold-blooded.

1024
01:09:46,578 --> 01:09:50,112
- Do you want to kill him or not?
- I'll cut him. I got a blade.

1025
01:09:50,373 --> 01:09:51,748
That's the spirit.

1026
01:09:51,999 --> 01:09:53,458
Do they fire?

1027
01:09:53,751 --> 01:09:54,914
Of course they fire.

1028
01:09:55,169 --> 01:09:57,292
But how do you know?
They're replicas.

1029
01:09:57,546 --> 01:09:59,503
What do you know about replicas?

1030
01:10:03,885 --> 01:10:05,842
What the fuck are you doing, Solomon?

1031
01:10:06,096 --> 01:10:08,254
You wanted to know
whether they worked.

1032
01:10:08,515 --> 01:10:13,307
I didn't mean try it in the car,
Sol, you arsehole!

1033
01:10:13,603 --> 01:10:16,094
What are you gonna do with that,
pick his teeth?

1034
01:10:16,355 --> 01:10:20,020
Wipe the butter off and put it away.
There's a proper blade back there.

1035
01:10:20,276 --> 01:10:23,644
Cows have only been domesticated
in the last 8000 years.

1036
01:10:23,904 --> 01:10:26,359
Before, they were running
around mad as lorries.

1037
01:10:26,615 --> 01:10:30,659
The human digestive system hasn't
got used to any dairy products yet.

1038
01:10:30,952 --> 01:10:33,787
Well, fuck me, Tommy.
What have you been reading?

1039
01:10:34,038 --> 01:10:35,947
Let me do you a favour.

1040
01:10:41,087 --> 01:10:42,082
Whoops.

1041
01:10:42,338 --> 01:10:43,748
You. Want a knife?

1042
01:10:44,006 --> 01:10:46,129
No, not me.
I wouldn't know what to do.

1043
01:10:46,383 --> 01:10:48,541
It's a knife, for God's sake.

1044
01:10:48,802 --> 01:10:51,091
What's kept your fork company
all these years?

1045
01:10:51,388 --> 01:10:54,638
The sharp side, the blunt side.
What do you want, a lesson?

1046
01:11:17,037 --> 01:11:18,068
Is that Boris?

1047
01:11:36,013 --> 01:11:38,682
Oh, Tyrone, what have you done?

1048
01:11:40,100 --> 01:11:41,475
What about Rosebud?

1049
01:11:41,726 --> 01:11:44,561
Well, you can bring him
with you if you like.

1050
01:11:45,938 --> 01:11:47,397
But which bit would you like?

1051
01:11:51,944 --> 01:11:52,940
They're getting out.

1052
01:11:54,071 --> 01:11:56,194
Get down and follow them.

1053
01:11:56,490 --> 01:11:58,447
Cover yourself up, Avi.

1054
01:11:58,700 --> 01:12:00,029
You're making a scene.

1055
01:12:00,327 --> 01:12:02,865
I'm sorry for causing a scene, Tony.

1056
01:12:03,538 --> 01:12:06,373
Whoa, you are not taking
that dog with you, Vince.

1057
01:12:06,666 --> 01:12:08,077
I can't leave him in here, can I?

1058
01:12:15,174 --> 01:12:17,131
Pint of the black stuff, landlord.

1059
01:12:18,761 --> 01:12:22,710
I thought you wanted to get
cleaned up. Bathroom's back there.

1060
01:12:23,056 --> 01:12:26,674
- He's left the door open.
- Shouldn't think that's a good idea.

1061
01:12:26,935 --> 01:12:28,310
Should we go in?

1062
01:12:28,561 --> 01:12:32,012
I don't want to go in there.
He's a dangerous bastard.

1063
01:12:32,315 --> 01:12:36,312
Taken too many disco biscuits
in the heat of Russian disputations.

1064
01:12:36,611 --> 01:12:40,026
He's got as many of these nuts
as he has those nuts.

1065
01:12:40,364 --> 01:12:43,151
I don't care if
he's got fucking hazelnuts.

1066
01:12:43,450 --> 01:12:47,115
I want a gun that works,
and I'm gonna tell him.

1067
01:12:47,746 --> 01:12:51,411
My God, Tommy, you certainly
got those minerals.

1068
01:12:51,708 --> 01:12:55,373
Well, come on, then
before "zee" Germans get here.

1069
01:12:55,628 --> 01:12:57,834
You just tell him who's in charge.

1070
01:13:03,844 --> 01:13:05,042
Boris...

1071
01:13:10,434 --> 01:13:11,596
You certainly told him.

1072
01:13:18,733 --> 01:13:20,606
The Drowning Trout.

1073
01:13:22,694 --> 01:13:24,069
Come and pick us up.

1074
01:13:24,362 --> 01:13:25,393
And Doug...

1075
01:13:26,573 --> 01:13:28,115
...sharpish.

1076
01:13:48,384 --> 01:13:51,219
I don't want a fuss or to put
a bullet in your face...

1077
01:13:51,512 --> 01:13:55,047
...but unless you give me what
I want there will be fucking murders.

1078
01:13:57,977 --> 01:13:58,842
What's your name?

1079
01:13:59,937 --> 01:14:00,719
Shoot him.

1080
01:14:08,069 --> 01:14:11,734
Let go of the gun!

1081
01:14:17,662 --> 01:14:21,030
So, you're obviously the big dick...

1082
01:14:21,874 --> 01:14:24,661
...and that, on either side of you,
are your balls.

1083
01:14:25,752 --> 01:14:27,792
There are two types of balls:

1084
01:14:28,547 --> 01:14:32,461
There are big brave balls,
and there are little faggot balls.

1085
01:14:32,717 --> 01:14:35,208
These are your last words
so make them a prayer.

1086
01:14:35,803 --> 01:14:38,010
Dicks have drive
and clarity of vision...

1087
01:14:39,265 --> 01:14:40,807
...but they're not clever.

1088
01:14:41,309 --> 01:14:44,393
They smell pussy and they want
a piece of the action.

1089
01:14:45,354 --> 01:14:48,557
And you thought you smelled
some good old pussy...

1090
01:14:48,899 --> 01:14:52,065
...and have brought your
two little faggot balls along...

1091
01:14:52,360 --> 01:14:55,776
...for a good old time. But
you've got your parties muddled up.

1092
01:14:57,532 --> 01:14:59,074
There's no pussy here...

1093
01:15:00,118 --> 01:15:03,569
...just a dose that'll make you wish
you were born a woman.

1094
01:15:04,288 --> 01:15:05,948
Like a prick...

1095
01:15:06,999 --> 01:15:08,541
...you're having second thoughts.

1096
01:15:09,585 --> 01:15:11,376
You're shrinking.

1097
01:15:12,296 --> 01:15:14,965
And your two little balls
are shrinking with you.

1098
01:15:16,133 --> 01:15:19,797
The fact that you've got "Replica"
written on the side of your gun...

1099
01:15:24,724 --> 01:15:29,220
...and the fact that
I've got "Desert Eagle.50"...

1100
01:15:31,939 --> 01:15:33,730
...written on the side of mine...

1101
01:15:38,528 --> 01:15:40,402
...should precipitate...

1102
01:15:41,573 --> 01:15:45,404
...your balls into shrinking,
along with your presence.

1103
01:15:47,745 --> 01:15:48,741
Now...

1104
01:15:51,540 --> 01:15:52,916
...fuck off.

1105
01:16:08,389 --> 01:16:09,848
Lock the door.

1106
01:16:10,141 --> 01:16:11,386
Lock it!

1107
01:16:17,314 --> 01:16:18,559
Give me the case.

1108
01:16:19,400 --> 01:16:20,942
Fuck you.

1109
01:16:21,944 --> 01:16:22,939
Shoot me.

1110
01:16:23,320 --> 01:16:25,359
I will. I'll shoot you.

1111
01:16:35,581 --> 01:16:38,416
Pass me case or I shoot you.

1112
01:16:39,460 --> 01:16:40,954
You know what?

1113
01:16:41,253 --> 01:16:42,249
Fuck you too.

1114
01:16:42,796 --> 01:16:46,165
Go ahead and shoot me. You'd be doing
me a favour, you Russian fuck.

1115
01:16:46,425 --> 01:16:49,129
You! Drop guns.

1116
01:16:49,844 --> 01:16:50,626
Fuck you!

1117
01:16:51,137 --> 01:16:52,881
You drop your gun!

1118
01:16:54,265 --> 01:16:55,463
Okay.

1119
01:16:56,476 --> 01:16:57,471
Avi...

1120
01:16:57,894 --> 01:16:58,889
...pull your socks up!

1121
01:17:12,114 --> 01:17:15,732
- Tyrone?
- Fuck it. We're out of here.

1122
01:17:16,910 --> 01:17:18,452
Give me case.

1123
01:17:31,173 --> 01:17:32,371
Avi...

1124
01:17:33,342 --> 01:17:35,548
...where's the case?
- Put the gun away.

1125
01:17:37,137 --> 01:17:38,797
What's Boris doing here?

1126
01:17:40,015 --> 01:17:41,972
Boris, what are you doing here?

1127
01:17:42,225 --> 01:17:44,182
Fuck you!

1128
01:17:52,777 --> 01:17:54,188
Where's the case?

1129
01:17:55,655 --> 01:17:58,228
- You piece of crap.
- Don't take the piss, Boris.

1130
01:17:58,491 --> 01:18:00,649
I'll show you.

1131
01:18:04,204 --> 01:18:05,782
Fuck you!

1132
01:18:09,751 --> 01:18:11,827
Almost had it.

1133
01:18:12,128 --> 01:18:13,919
For fuck's sake.

1134
01:18:18,134 --> 01:18:20,091
Fuck you and all.

1135
01:18:21,762 --> 01:18:24,467
You lucky bastard.

1136
01:18:30,312 --> 01:18:32,719
Jeez, it's flawless.

1137
01:18:33,398 --> 01:18:36,185
Don't get attached to it.
It's going to Brick Top.

1138
01:18:36,526 --> 01:18:37,806
Leave the dog here.

1139
01:18:38,069 --> 01:18:42,695
- Sol, why don't we just leave?
- Because life's too short, Vincent...

1140
01:18:42,948 --> 01:18:45,783
...and it'll get a lot shorter
if Brick Top wishes.

1141
01:18:46,076 --> 01:18:49,445
- Now leave that dog here.
- I'm gonna leave the dog here.

1142
01:18:49,705 --> 01:18:50,487
Don't worry about it!

1143
01:18:50,747 --> 01:18:54,531
And if that pikey mutt does
any damage, you're gonna pay.

1144
01:18:56,336 --> 01:18:57,166
It's okay.

1145
01:18:58,213 --> 01:18:59,956
Sit down. Down.

1146
01:19:04,844 --> 01:19:07,928
I don't want to go in there.
You'll never see me again.

1147
01:19:08,180 --> 01:19:10,422
Well, we won't if you don't.

1148
01:19:11,183 --> 01:19:13,259
All right, you give me the stone...

1149
01:19:13,560 --> 01:19:17,427
...and I will give it
to Brick Top. Yeah?

1150
01:19:17,731 --> 01:19:21,775
All right. Give me a minute.
It's a bit fiddly.

1151
01:19:25,613 --> 01:19:26,776
Why is it down there?

1152
01:19:27,865 --> 01:19:30,819
Well, I put it down there
in case we got mugged.

1153
01:19:31,076 --> 01:19:32,868
You ain't from this planet, are you?

1154
01:19:33,329 --> 01:19:37,077
Who is gonna mug two black fellas
holding pistols...

1155
01:19:37,332 --> 01:19:41,033
...sat in a car that's worth less
than your shirt?

1156
01:19:43,713 --> 01:19:47,627
Bullet-Tooth Tony and his friend,
Desert Eagle.50.

1157
01:19:48,009 --> 01:19:50,381
What have they got to do
with anything?

1158
01:19:50,678 --> 01:19:52,836
They're both staring straight at me.

1159
01:19:55,975 --> 01:20:00,221
You should never underestimate
the predictability of stupidity.

1160
01:20:00,604 --> 01:20:01,635
Now, out of the car.

1161
01:20:02,189 --> 01:20:04,228
And leave your water pistols behind.

1162
01:20:05,150 --> 01:20:08,815
Look, just tell him the stone's back
at the office.

1163
01:20:09,112 --> 01:20:10,654
I'll think of something.

1164
01:20:15,409 --> 01:20:16,358
Why's he sweating?

1165
01:20:18,746 --> 01:20:19,777
Oh, never mind.

1166
01:20:20,080 --> 01:20:22,571
Tommy, why is your skin leaking?

1167
01:20:22,833 --> 01:20:27,044
- I'm a little worried, actually.
- Worried about what?

1168
01:20:27,796 --> 01:20:31,461
What happens if the gypsy knocks
the other man out?

1169
01:20:31,758 --> 01:20:33,631
I mean, he's done it before,
hasn't he?

1170
01:20:33,926 --> 01:20:37,876
We get murdered before we leave the
building, and we get fed to the pigs.

1171
01:20:38,889 --> 01:20:42,721
I'm glad to see you're climbing
the walls in fucking anxiety.

1172
01:20:44,520 --> 01:20:48,564
Pardon my cynicism,
but I don't exactly trust the pikey.

1173
01:20:48,857 --> 01:20:51,014
Don't think I haven't thunk
about that one.

1174
01:20:51,275 --> 01:20:54,940
It's his mum's funeral tonight.
God bless her.

1175
01:20:57,697 --> 01:21:00,568
<i>You know those gypsies
like a drink at a wake.</i>

1176
01:21:00,825 --> 01:21:04,276
I'm not worried about whether Mickey
knocks the other man out.

1177
01:21:04,537 --> 01:21:07,573
I'm worried about whether he makes it
to the fourth round.

1178
01:21:07,832 --> 01:21:10,453
<i>What if he doesn't make it
to the fourth round?</i>

1179
01:21:10,710 --> 01:21:13,035
We get murdered before leaving
the building...

1180
01:21:13,295 --> 01:21:16,498
...and I imagine we get fed
to the pigs.

1181
01:21:18,675 --> 01:21:20,632
So why are you so calm?

1182
01:21:21,636 --> 01:21:23,878
- I said...
- I heard what you said, Tommy!

1183
01:21:24,597 --> 01:21:27,302
It's not as though we've got a choice,
now, is it?

1184
01:21:27,559 --> 01:21:30,595
You show me how to control
a wild fucking gypsy...

1185
01:21:30,895 --> 01:21:35,355
...and I'll show you how to control
an unhinged, pig-feeding gangster.

1186
01:21:36,525 --> 01:21:39,098
Bollocks! I'm going for a walk.

1187
01:22:19,065 --> 01:22:20,642
Oh, that fucking dog!

1188
01:22:22,109 --> 01:22:23,651
Go on, get the dog.

1189
01:22:24,570 --> 01:22:27,820
- It's a bit funky in here, isn't it?
- Open a window.

1190
01:22:36,039 --> 01:22:38,245
You people live like animals.

1191
01:22:38,791 --> 01:22:40,451
Now, where's the stone?

1192
01:22:40,751 --> 01:22:42,910
- Come on, where is it?
- It's over here.

1193
01:22:43,170 --> 01:22:46,254
- Where? Where?
- I left it in a box.

1194
01:22:51,595 --> 01:22:52,508
It's empty.

1195
01:22:52,763 --> 01:22:55,847
I'm getting heartburn.
Tony, do something terrible.

1196
01:22:56,808 --> 01:22:58,884
No, I'm being serious!

1197
01:22:59,143 --> 01:23:01,599
The dog. The dog must have had it.

1198
01:23:05,358 --> 01:23:08,773
Now then, let's have a look,
shall we? Tony.

1199
01:23:10,154 --> 01:23:12,727
- What?
- Look in the dog.

1200
01:23:14,283 --> 01:23:17,070
- You mean, "look in the dog"?
- I mean, open him up.

1201
01:23:21,498 --> 01:23:24,747
It's not a tin of baked beans.
What do you mean, open him up?

1202
01:23:25,001 --> 01:23:26,993
You know what I mean.

1203
01:23:29,588 --> 01:23:30,584
That's a bit strong.

1204
01:23:32,591 --> 01:23:33,622
I don't know about this.

1205
01:23:35,219 --> 01:23:36,879
No, you can't do this.

1206
01:23:39,598 --> 01:23:40,973
It's fucking squeaking!

1207
01:23:41,224 --> 01:23:45,304
You never heard a dog squeak before?
Give me that goddamn gun!

1208
01:23:47,939 --> 01:23:49,599
I'm shooting the dog!

1209
01:23:57,865 --> 01:23:59,489
Shoot the fucking dog!

1210
01:24:10,335 --> 01:24:13,039
You sneaky fucking bastard.

1211
01:24:25,057 --> 01:24:26,052
Thank God for that.

1212
01:24:36,566 --> 01:24:39,852
I hate fucking dogs!
Come on, Tony.

1213
01:24:42,822 --> 01:24:44,482
Tony, come on!

1214
01:24:52,831 --> 01:24:54,076
Tony?

1215
01:25:06,302 --> 01:25:09,054
- Anything to declare?
- Yeah. Don't go to England.

1216
01:25:11,766 --> 01:25:15,597
That dog is gonna go back
to the campsite. It always does.

1217
01:25:15,894 --> 01:25:17,934
How's the dog gonna find the campsite?

1218
01:25:18,230 --> 01:25:20,436
Have you smelled the campsite, Sol?

1219
01:25:20,732 --> 01:25:23,649
All right. But we have
to wait until it gets light.

1220
01:25:23,902 --> 01:25:25,811
And we have to get rid
of these bodies.

1221
01:25:26,070 --> 01:25:29,356
That one with the tea cosy
on his head's starting to stink.

1222
01:25:29,657 --> 01:25:34,734
Right. Let's stick them in the car,
and then go and look for a pig farm.

1223
01:25:37,957 --> 01:25:39,285
Mickey.

1224
01:25:41,376 --> 01:25:42,491
Mickey!

1225
01:25:45,172 --> 01:25:46,998
You feeling all right, Mickey?

1226
01:25:49,884 --> 01:25:50,999
Need a drink.

1227
01:25:53,763 --> 01:25:55,138
You can't give him a drink!

1228
01:25:55,431 --> 01:25:57,388
It's not for him. It's for me.

1229
01:26:03,021 --> 01:26:05,014
Ah, mates. Amen.

1230
01:26:11,988 --> 01:26:16,448
He's a hard bastard, this Good Night
Anderson, so pay attention.

1231
01:26:17,452 --> 01:26:18,827
All right, Mickey?

1232
01:26:19,578 --> 01:26:20,907
Mickey!

1233
01:26:25,376 --> 01:26:27,167
Need to have a shite!

1234
01:26:28,337 --> 01:26:33,082
If you see the pikey, Turkish or
his girlfriend come out before me...

1235
01:26:33,341 --> 01:26:35,417
...shoot the bastards.

1236
01:26:37,637 --> 01:26:40,210
Well, come on.
We got a fight to go to.

1237
01:26:47,313 --> 01:26:48,688
All right, Tom.

1238
01:26:49,648 --> 01:26:53,776
- Hope we get a better show this time.
- This will make up for it.

1239
01:26:54,027 --> 01:26:56,316
Mickey's going down in the fourth.

1240
01:26:56,571 --> 01:26:59,062
Terry over there is in charge
of the bets.

1241
01:26:59,365 --> 01:27:00,990
Now, you have to forgive me.

1242
01:27:01,284 --> 01:27:03,857
I'll forgive you
if he goes down this time.

1243
01:27:07,123 --> 01:27:10,076
- Our lads at the campsite?
- They're over there now.

1244
01:27:13,378 --> 01:27:15,620
I fucking hate pikeys.

1245
01:27:17,632 --> 01:27:21,677
- How long have we gotta stay here?
- As long as it takes. Now, shut up.

1246
01:27:22,762 --> 01:27:24,719
Fucking hate pikeys.

1247
01:27:25,890 --> 01:27:27,847
Is he fucking stoned?

1248
01:27:28,351 --> 01:27:30,343
He's like that before a fight.

1249
01:27:30,644 --> 01:27:32,969
Do you know when you're going down?

1250
01:27:33,230 --> 01:27:35,768
Of course he knows
when he's going down.

1251
01:27:36,024 --> 01:27:40,271
Fuck-face, who's speaking to you?
He asked him, didn't he?

1252
01:27:40,570 --> 01:27:43,144
Fuck-face? I like that one, Errol.

1253
01:27:43,406 --> 01:27:45,778
I'll remember that next time
I climb off your mum.

1254
01:27:46,034 --> 01:27:49,367
- Not now.
- Gonna be a tragedy of a fight.

1255
01:27:49,579 --> 01:27:52,449
Be a nice one.
Hell of a way to be a war.

1256
01:27:52,707 --> 01:27:54,165
And there none a yours.

1257
01:27:55,501 --> 01:27:59,368
There's a camp full of pikeys
that might not think you're so funny.

1258
01:27:59,630 --> 01:28:02,915
Not when they're putting out flames
on their children's backs.

1259
01:28:04,467 --> 01:28:06,341
Now get up and have a fucking fight.

1260
01:28:12,391 --> 01:28:15,843
Three rounds and you're a vegetable,
aren't you, pikey!

1261
01:29:06,357 --> 01:29:09,393
I'm in charge here.
No fucking about, no eye-gouging.

1262
01:29:09,652 --> 01:29:11,810
Do your worst. Let's get it on!

1263
01:29:43,308 --> 01:29:46,095
What the fuck's going on?
You gonna finish him or what?

1264
01:30:28,392 --> 01:30:30,016
Talk about saved by the bell.

1265
01:30:30,560 --> 01:30:34,143
Do you understand the consequences
of knocking that man out?

1266
01:30:34,439 --> 01:30:36,681
<i>Do not knock him out, Mickey.</i>

1267
01:30:43,322 --> 01:30:45,030
All right, let's break it up.

1268
01:31:19,064 --> 01:31:20,474
What, is he fucking deaf?

1269
01:31:21,941 --> 01:31:23,685
What is he doing?

1270
01:31:39,458 --> 01:31:40,786
Come on and sit.

1271
01:31:43,628 --> 01:31:45,585
What the fuck are you doing, Mickey?

1272
01:31:45,839 --> 01:31:47,914
You're dancing like a fairy.

1273
01:31:48,216 --> 01:31:50,837
<i>They'll hang us
if they think it's rigged.</i>

1274
01:31:51,636 --> 01:31:53,758
Get out there and hurt him.

1275
01:31:55,181 --> 01:32:00,056
But for fuck's sake,
do not knock him out.

1276
01:33:20,384 --> 01:33:23,254
<i>All he's got to do is stay down.</i>

1277
01:33:27,849 --> 01:33:30,007
<i>Now, we are fucked.</i>

1278
01:33:38,317 --> 01:33:39,266
He can't stand up.

1279
01:33:39,526 --> 01:33:40,273
We're out of here.

1280
01:33:40,569 --> 01:33:45,646
<i>Stupid pikey knows Brick Top's got
keen-to-kill monkeys with shotguns...</i>

1281
01:33:45,907 --> 01:33:48,363
<i>... sitting outside his campsite.</i>

1282
01:33:48,702 --> 01:33:53,577
<i>Once the campsite's wiped out,
I know it's gonna be the same for us.</i>

1283
01:33:56,250 --> 01:33:58,077
<i>Ever cross the road
and look the wrong way?</i>

1284
01:33:58,336 --> 01:33:59,794
Give me that fucking shooter!

1285
01:34:00,087 --> 01:34:02,708
<i>And, hey, presto,
there's a car nearly on you.</i>

1286
01:34:03,007 --> 01:34:04,121
<i>So, what do you do?</i>

1287
01:34:04,758 --> 01:34:06,834
<i>Something very silly.</i>

1288
01:34:07,219 --> 01:34:10,089
<i>You freeze. And your life
doesn't flash before you...</i>

1289
01:34:10,347 --> 01:34:12,837
<i>... because you're too scared
to think.</i>

1290
01:34:13,141 --> 01:34:16,177
<i>You just freeze
and pull a stupid face.</i>

1291
01:34:16,477 --> 01:34:18,684
<i>But the pikey didn't. Why?</i>

1292
01:34:18,938 --> 01:34:21,725
<i>Because he had plans
on running the car over.</i>

1293
01:34:24,151 --> 01:34:26,227
<i>It had previously occurred to me...</i>

1294
01:34:26,528 --> 01:34:29,778
<i>... that he'd taken the demise
of his mother rather lightly.</i>

1295
01:34:32,993 --> 01:34:35,697
<i>For every action,
there is a reaction.</i>

1296
01:34:35,995 --> 01:34:37,869
<i>And a pikey reaction...</i>

1297
01:34:38,581 --> 01:34:39,909
<i>... is quite a fucking thing.</i>

1298
01:35:21,955 --> 01:35:23,994
Pete, talk to me.

1299
01:35:24,249 --> 01:35:27,831
If you want your friend to hear you,
talk a lot louder than that.

1300
01:35:36,844 --> 01:35:40,378
- Give me that fucking shooter.
- I'll give you your shooter, you cunt.

1301
01:35:48,438 --> 01:35:52,056
<i>That is when I thought the pikey
had money riding on himself.</i>

1302
01:35:53,108 --> 01:35:56,607
<i>That's why the bastard never
goes down when he's supposed to.</i>

1303
01:35:58,404 --> 01:36:00,148
<i>We've been tucked up...</i>

1304
01:36:01,824 --> 01:36:03,402
<i>... while he's been cleaning up.</i>

1305
01:36:05,578 --> 01:36:08,151
<i>We're worse off now than
when we started.</i>

1306
01:36:13,668 --> 01:36:16,076
<i>The next day we went
to the campsite...</i>

1307
01:36:16,379 --> 01:36:19,499
<i>... but the gypsies had disappeared
during the night.</i>

1308
01:36:19,757 --> 01:36:21,714
<i>Which was probably a good thing...</i>

1309
01:36:22,009 --> 01:36:26,386
<i>... considering they'd just buried
12 people somewhere in the area.</i>

1310
01:36:26,722 --> 01:36:28,051
Where is he?

1311
01:36:28,349 --> 01:36:30,425
He ain't fucking here,
that's for sure.

1312
01:36:31,268 --> 01:36:34,767
We can't ask a man to fight for us
if we can't find him, can we?

1313
01:36:35,022 --> 01:36:38,271
You won't find a pikey that
doesn't want to be found.

1314
01:36:40,485 --> 01:36:43,688
He could be in a campsite
in Kampu-fucking-chea by now.

1315
01:36:45,281 --> 01:36:47,072
Bollocks! Come on.

1316
01:36:52,371 --> 01:36:55,158
- What you doing here?
- What's it got to do with you?

1317
01:36:59,086 --> 01:37:01,208
So, what you doing here?

1318
01:37:08,845 --> 01:37:11,680
I'm taking the dog for a walk.
What's the problem?

1319
01:37:13,390 --> 01:37:14,256
What's in the car?

1320
01:37:14,975 --> 01:37:16,469
Seats and a steering wheel.

1321
01:37:17,644 --> 01:37:19,436
What do you know about gypsies?

1322
01:37:21,231 --> 01:37:23,188
I know they're not to be trusted.

1323
01:37:25,277 --> 01:37:27,946
All right, get your dog. On your way.

1324
01:37:28,821 --> 01:37:30,316
Get the dog, Tommy.

1325
01:37:32,200 --> 01:37:33,445
The dog.

1326
01:37:35,036 --> 01:37:39,496
All right, boy. Come on.
Come on, Daisy. No, Daisy!

1327
01:37:40,249 --> 01:37:41,909
He loves that dog.

1328
01:37:42,292 --> 01:37:44,000
Always playing silly games.

1329
01:37:44,252 --> 01:37:47,621
Stop messing about
and get it in the car. Tommy!

1330
01:37:49,507 --> 01:37:54,252
Good boy. Good boy.
Good boy, Daisy, good boy.

1331
01:38:05,063 --> 01:38:06,558
Could you tell me...

1332
01:38:06,857 --> 01:38:10,060
...why you got a dead man
with an arm missing in your boot?

1333
01:38:10,694 --> 01:38:11,689
Hey, George...

1334
01:38:13,113 --> 01:38:15,271
...is that a tea cosy on his head?

1335
01:38:18,701 --> 01:38:21,109
Oh, you love a dog, don't you, Tommy?

1336
01:38:31,046 --> 01:38:33,584
<i>Tommy persuaded me to keep the dog.</i>

1337
01:38:33,840 --> 01:38:37,458
<i>I eventually agreed,
as long as he took it to a vet.</i>

1338
01:38:37,719 --> 01:38:40,174
<i>I couldn't stand
that squeaking anymore.</i>

1339
01:38:40,471 --> 01:38:43,805
<i>The vet found half an undigested
shoe, a squeaky toy...</i>

1340
01:38:44,058 --> 01:38:47,343
<i>... and an 84-carat diamond
lodged in its stomach.</i>

1341
01:38:47,978 --> 01:38:50,469
<i>It's quite amazing what can happen
in a week.</i>

1342
01:38:50,898 --> 01:38:52,855
<i>Still didn't shut it up, though.</i>

1343
01:38:53,775 --> 01:38:55,602
<i>So, what do you do?</i>

1344
01:38:55,902 --> 01:38:58,773
<i>You go see the man that knows
about these sort of things.</i>

1345
01:38:59,030 --> 01:39:00,572
So, what do you think?

1346
01:39:02,367 --> 01:39:04,525
Do you know anyone
who'd be interested?

1347
01:39:09,457 --> 01:39:10,286
I might.

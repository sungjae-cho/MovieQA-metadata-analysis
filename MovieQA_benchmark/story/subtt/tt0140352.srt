1
00:03:40,304 --> 00:03:42,223
- Coffee?
- Yeah, thank you.

2
00:03:44,475 --> 00:03:46,185
How have you liked your stay?

3
00:03:47,478 --> 00:03:50,439
What I've seen, I've liked.

4
00:03:54,819 --> 00:03:58,072
Please to explain
why I should agree to interview

5
00:03:58,155 --> 00:04:00,825
with pro-Zionist American media?

6
00:04:02,326 --> 00:04:04,328
Because I think Hezbollah

7
00:04:04,495 --> 00:04:08,749
is trying to broaden
into a political party right now,

8
00:04:08,833 --> 00:04:11,585
so you care about
what you're thought of in America,

9
00:04:11,669 --> 00:04:17,675
and in America at this moment in time,
Hezbollah does not have a face.

10
00:04:17,758 --> 00:04:18,843
That's why.

11
00:04:18,968 --> 00:04:21,428
Perhaps you prove
journalism objectivity,

12
00:04:21,512 --> 00:04:23,639
and I see the questions first.

13
00:04:23,722 --> 00:04:26,684
Then I decide if I grant the interview.

14
00:04:26,767 --> 00:04:28,894
No, we don't do that.

15
00:04:29,854 --> 00:04:32,690
You've seen 60 Minutes
and Mike Wallace,

16
00:04:32,773 --> 00:04:35,943
so you know our reputation
for integrity and objectivity.

17
00:04:36,026 --> 00:04:40,364
You also know we are
the highest-rated, most-respected

18
00:04:41,115 --> 00:04:44,118
TV magazine news show in America.

19
00:04:51,709 --> 00:04:54,837
So, Mr. Wallace...
Should he get on a plane or not?

20
00:04:56,922 --> 00:04:59,884
Tell him I'll see him day after tomorrow.

21
00:05:00,176 --> 00:05:01,969
That's good. That works.

22
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:10,227
I want to ask you something.
I know it sounds odd, but...

23
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:16,483
Hello? Sheikh?

24
00:05:20,237 --> 00:05:22,323
Hello? Sheikh?

25
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:31,498
- Norman?
- What? What?

26
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:34,168
Take your blindfold off.

27
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:42,134
Welcome to the world.

28
00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:50,434
Fluctuating all over the place.

29
00:05:51,101 --> 00:05:54,438
Anywhere we shoot here, it's gonna be
portable gennies and we'll run cable.

30
00:06:05,115 --> 00:06:08,369
- Hello?
- Mike, it's me. We're on.

31
00:08:01,732 --> 00:08:03,567
- Hi, honey.
- Hi, Daddy.

32
00:08:03,651 --> 00:08:04,651
What's new?

33
00:08:04,943 --> 00:08:06,403
Miss Loughrey gave me a star today.

34
00:08:07,321 --> 00:08:09,198
Yeah? What for?

35
00:08:09,281 --> 00:08:12,076
- For reading.
- That's great.

36
00:08:19,792 --> 00:08:22,419
A little early for cartoons, isn't it?

37
00:08:23,962 --> 00:08:25,631
Okay.

38
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:34,807
Deborah? Debbie?

39
00:08:44,108 --> 00:08:47,903
Oh, I didn't know you were home.
It's early, isn't it?

40
00:08:51,407 --> 00:08:53,617
Gotta take Debbie to ballet.

41
00:08:54,535 --> 00:08:55,702
BARBARA: Mommy!

42
00:09:04,962 --> 00:09:06,714
Sweetheart, come on. Come on.

43
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:08,924
She was playing
with my Pooh doll again.

44
00:09:09,591 --> 00:09:12,803
Slow down, slow down, slow down.
Breathe deep, breathe deep.

45
00:09:15,764 --> 00:09:17,558
Slowdown, honey. Slowdown.

46
00:09:18,726 --> 00:09:20,185
Slow down.

47
00:09:21,145 --> 00:09:22,312
Here we go.

48
00:09:22,688 --> 00:09:26,275
- Deep breaths. Deep breaths.
- She was playing with the Pooh doll.

49
00:09:26,358 --> 00:09:28,026
Pooh's dusty, sweetheart.

50
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:30,938
He's dusty
and you breathed him in, okay?

51
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:32,692
So, what's happening to you...
Look at me.

52
00:09:32,756 --> 00:09:35,367
What's happening to you now
is cells called "mass cells"

53
00:09:36,118 --> 00:09:39,663
told your lungs,
"Don't breathe any more of that dust in."

54
00:09:39,747 --> 00:09:42,124
And the airways in your lungs
are like branches,

55
00:09:42,833 --> 00:09:46,128
and when the branches close up,
you get an asthmatic attack,

56
00:09:46,211 --> 00:09:50,716
and we give you medicine
and you get better. Uh-huh? Okay?

57
00:09:51,508 --> 00:09:53,802
Better already, aren't you?

58
00:10:01,977 --> 00:10:03,353
Okay, baby?

59
00:10:11,904 --> 00:10:14,406
Can I go to dance tomorrow? I'm better.

60
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:18,118
If you are, then I'll take Barbara
to soccer and take you to dance after.

61
00:10:18,452 --> 00:10:19,620
I can take her.

62
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:22,372
Don't you have to be at the office?

63
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:27,586
- Is there any more rice?
- Yes, it's on the stove.

64
00:10:31,507 --> 00:10:34,801
LIANE: Do you want more rice?
DEBORAH: Maybe later.

65
00:10:34,885 --> 00:10:36,720
LIANE: How about you?
BARBARA: I'll take some.

66
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:37,888
Instant rice?

67
00:10:43,977 --> 00:10:45,687
BARBARA: Can I go over
to Jeanine's house?

68
00:10:46,004 --> 00:10:47,973
I'm sorry, darling.
Have you seen my coffee mug?

69
00:10:49,066 --> 00:10:50,192
Try the car.

70
00:11:12,756 --> 00:11:14,716
What are those boxes?

71
00:11:15,526 --> 00:11:17,302
I'm going to the store.
You need anything?

72
00:11:17,386 --> 00:11:19,179
- What do you need at the store?
- Soy sauce.

73
00:11:19,263 --> 00:11:20,264
Right now?

74
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:22,975
That's my stuff from the office.

75
00:11:23,058 --> 00:11:25,686
Why did you take your stuff
from the office?

76
00:11:25,769 --> 00:11:28,480
- I didn't want to leave it there.
- I don't understand.

77
00:11:32,234 --> 00:11:33,944
I got fired this morning.

78
00:11:35,362 --> 00:11:36,947
Where else am I gonna take it?

79
00:11:38,448 --> 00:11:39,950
Why?

80
00:11:40,617 --> 00:11:43,370
- Who said?
- Thomas Sandefur.

81
00:11:48,292 --> 00:11:50,502
What are we supposed to do?

82
00:11:51,962 --> 00:11:55,799
What about our medical coverage?
What about our health?

83
00:11:55,882 --> 00:12:00,137
What about our car payments?
The payments on this house?

84
00:12:08,812 --> 00:12:11,523
The severance agreement
includes cash payoffs over time

85
00:12:11,607 --> 00:12:13,650
and continuing medical coverage.

86
00:12:14,484 --> 00:12:16,320
Sure you don't need anything?

87
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:18,780
No, thank you.

88
00:12:26,788 --> 00:12:28,415
Jeffrey?

89
00:12:47,142 --> 00:12:51,021
I am very pleased to receive you
as my guest, Mr. Wallace.

90
00:12:51,405 --> 00:12:52,831
Well, thank you for having us.

91
00:12:53,899 --> 00:12:56,860
Think I got a problem with the gennie.
I gotta go outside.

92
00:13:00,864 --> 00:13:02,574
Give me a hand with this, will you?

93
00:13:05,744 --> 00:13:07,329
Norman!

94
00:13:11,249 --> 00:13:14,294
- He says, you must not sit so close.
- What?

95
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:18,632
I can't conduct an interview
from back there.

96
00:13:22,719 --> 00:13:25,263
You must move back your chair.

97
00:13:25,764 --> 00:13:28,225
Well, you tell him that
when I conduct an interview,

98
00:13:28,308 --> 00:13:31,228
I sit anywhere I damn please.

99
00:13:37,442 --> 00:13:38,610
There is no interview.

100
00:13:39,903 --> 00:13:40,904
You!

101
00:13:41,947 --> 00:13:42,948
I'm talking to you!

102
00:13:43,031 --> 00:13:46,076
What the hell do you think I am,
a 78-year-old assassin?

103
00:13:46,493 --> 00:13:49,496
You think I'm gonna karate him to death
with this notepad?

104
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,797
- Are you interpreting what I'm saying?
- Yes.

105
00:13:58,880 --> 00:13:59,923
- We're there.
- Good.

106
00:14:00,048 --> 00:14:02,092
Well, ask him if Arabic is
his second language.

107
00:14:02,718 --> 00:14:04,720
Don't interpret that. Hold it.

108
00:14:04,803 --> 00:14:07,264
Hold it! Hold it! Slow! Slow!

109
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:10,267
Sheikh, do you mind?

110
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:14,646
If you would just turn your chair
a little bit to face Mr. Wallace.

111
00:14:18,108 --> 00:14:19,234
- Is that okay?
- Okay.

112
00:14:22,154 --> 00:14:25,198
Are you ready
or do you wanna keep fucking around

113
00:14:25,282 --> 00:14:26,700
and warm up some more?

114
00:14:26,783 --> 00:14:29,703
- No, I've got my heart started.
- Okay.

115
00:14:31,329 --> 00:14:33,165
All right, Todd.

116
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:37,627
Give me
the three-button on Mike, please.

117
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:40,839
Good. Good.

118
00:14:42,257 --> 00:14:43,467
Okay, we are rolling.

119
00:14:48,221 --> 00:14:49,598
Okay, Mike.

120
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:53,060
Sheikh Fadlallah,
thank you so much for seeing us.

121
00:14:53,143 --> 00:14:54,311
Are you a terrorist?

122
00:14:55,937 --> 00:14:59,649
Mr. Wallace, I am a servant of God.

123
00:15:00,108 --> 00:15:02,569
A servant of God? Really?

124
00:15:03,195 --> 00:15:06,406
Americans believe that you,
as an Islamic fundamentalist,

125
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:11,995
that you are a leader who contributed
to the bombing of the US Embassy.

126
00:15:34,476 --> 00:15:37,145
Everybody thinks
Canadian Mounties ride horses

127
00:15:37,229 --> 00:15:38,772
and rescue ladies from rapids.

128
00:15:38,855 --> 00:15:42,192
Mike, they backed locals in Oka
in a fight with Mohawks

129
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:44,945
over building a golf course
on their burial site,

130
00:15:45,028 --> 00:15:47,364
they beat up protesters at Kanehsatake.

131
00:15:49,825 --> 00:15:51,910
- Where'd you hear that?
- Hello.

132
00:15:51,993 --> 00:15:55,631
Oh, someone took a poll?
"Are all things Canadian boring?"

133
00:15:55,714 --> 00:15:58,283
- It's Stuart. He's in Mexico City.
- Oh. Let me call you back.

134
00:15:59,126 --> 00:16:00,752
Yeah, Stuart?

135
00:16:01,511 --> 00:16:02,854
- What New York bank?
- Hey, Dad.

136
00:16:04,673 --> 00:16:07,717
Will he go on camera
and talk about the Mexico City branch?

137
00:16:07,801 --> 00:16:09,845
- Hey, Jake.
- Whose money are they laundering?

138
00:16:09,928 --> 00:16:13,557
- No classes this morning?
- I don't have to be there till 10:30.

139
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,684
- Hey, Mom. Hello.
- Hi, sweetheart.

140
00:16:20,897 --> 00:16:23,358
- Hello? Yeah.
- Do independent sources corroborate?

141
00:16:28,747 --> 00:16:31,124
- Dad, you got a box out here.
- Let me see this a second.

142
00:16:32,033 --> 00:16:34,661
'Cause I gotta know
where you're going at all times.

143
00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:48,658
SHARON: I can't.
I've gotta fly to Boston tomorrow.

144
00:16:49,217 --> 00:16:52,429
2:00 p.m. Great. Bye-bye

145
00:16:53,221 --> 00:16:57,183
"Ignition propensity."
You understand any of this?

146
00:17:02,105 --> 00:17:03,565
No.

147
00:17:05,442 --> 00:17:07,360
This looks like a table of temperatures.

148
00:17:07,861 --> 00:17:10,113
- Who's this from?
- It's anonymous.

149
00:17:10,947 --> 00:17:13,116
References to "P.M."

150
00:17:13,783 --> 00:17:15,452
It's gotta be Phillip Morris, huh?

151
00:17:15,869 --> 00:17:18,371
Hmm. I have to take a shower.

152
00:17:38,308 --> 00:17:39,309
Yeah?

153
00:17:39,684 --> 00:17:43,188
- Hi, this is Doug Oliver.
- Oh, hi, Doug. It's Lowell.

154
00:17:43,647 --> 00:17:45,106
I'm doing this story on fire safety,

155
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:47,400
and people burning up
from falling asleep smoking.

156
00:17:47,484 --> 00:17:51,905
I receive a shitload of scientific papers
from inside Phillip Morris.

157
00:17:52,155 --> 00:17:54,407
Anonymous. You or anybody in FDA

158
00:17:54,491 --> 00:17:58,453
know someone who can translate
this stuff into English forme?

159
00:17:58,828 --> 00:17:59,913
Uh, yeah.

160
00:18:16,513 --> 00:18:17,514
Hello?

161
00:18:19,015 --> 00:18:20,141
Mr. Wigand, please?

162
00:18:21,393 --> 00:18:23,687
Someone's calling for Daddy, Mom.

163
00:18:27,691 --> 00:18:29,609
Oh. Thank you, Bob.

164
00:18:29,693 --> 00:18:32,195
- Who's calling?
- My name is Lowell Bergman.

165
00:18:32,279 --> 00:18:36,741
- Did you say "Berman?"
- No, Bergman. B-E-R-G-M-A-N.

166
00:18:36,825 --> 00:18:39,119
- I'm a producer for 60 Minutes.
- 60 Minutes?

167
00:18:39,202 --> 00:18:40,203
Yeah.

168
00:18:40,537 --> 00:18:43,707
- 60 Minutes, the television show?
- Yes.

169
00:18:44,457 --> 00:18:45,709
He doesn't want to talk to you.

170
00:18:47,286 --> 00:18:49,354
How does he know
he doesn't want to talk to me?

171
00:18:49,356 --> 00:18:51,074
He doesn't know
what I'm calling him about.

172
00:18:51,673 --> 00:18:53,216
He doesn't care to know.

173
00:19:17,374 --> 00:19:19,025
WIGAND ON MACHINE:
This is the Wigands'.

174
00:19:19,108 --> 00:19:22,412
If you'd like to leave a message
or send a fax, start now.

175
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:24,456
This is Lowell Bergman
with 60 Minutes,

176
00:19:24,539 --> 00:19:27,375
and I'm doing a story
on fire safety and cigarettes.

177
00:19:27,459 --> 00:19:30,670
have scientific documents
from a tobacco company

178
00:19:30,754 --> 00:19:33,506
and I could use your help
as a consultant

179
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:35,425
explaining these documents to me.

180
00:19:35,508 --> 00:19:41,681
Now, my number is
area code 510-555-0199.

181
00:19:41,765 --> 00:19:44,267
' jbe there at this number
in 10 minutes.

182
00:22:14,834 --> 00:22:19,339
If you're curious to meet me,
I'm gonna be in the lobby

183
00:22:19,422 --> 00:22:23,134
of the Seelbach Hotel in Louisville

184
00:22:23,218 --> 00:22:26,679
reading The New York Times
tomorrow at 5:00.

185
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:47,552
BERGMAN: Have you always
lived in Louisville?

186
00:23:48,678 --> 00:23:51,973
Mr. Bergman,
what did you want me to consult about?

187
00:23:54,851 --> 00:23:55,935
Who's that?

188
00:23:57,562 --> 00:23:58,980
That's room service.

189
00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:01,816
They usually knock first.

190
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:06,863
Come on in. Over here, please.

191
00:24:17,123 --> 00:24:18,333
Thank you.

192
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,544
How do you like your coffee? Black?

193
00:24:21,627 --> 00:24:23,379
Black. Black.

194
00:24:24,964 --> 00:24:27,216
I really don't have that much time.

195
00:24:30,053 --> 00:24:32,639
Is there anything you want to know
about me, Mr. Wigand?

196
00:24:32,722 --> 00:24:34,849
Like what? Your sign?

197
00:24:38,227 --> 00:24:41,439
- I know what I have to know.
- Just so I know you know,

198
00:24:42,231 --> 00:24:45,943
when I talk to people in confidence,
it stays that way.

199
00:24:48,488 --> 00:24:52,325
How did a radical journalist from
Ramparts Magazine end up at CBS?

200
00:24:55,203 --> 00:24:59,707
I still do the tough stories.
60 Minutes reaches a lot of people.

201
00:25:03,336 --> 00:25:05,380
Let me see the documents.

202
00:25:32,865 --> 00:25:37,620
This is a fire-safety product study
for Phillip Morris.

203
00:25:39,122 --> 00:25:42,917
Burn rates, ignition propensity,
things of this nature.

204
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,003
I could very easily explain this
to you in layman's terms

205
00:25:46,087 --> 00:25:49,465
because it's from another company,
but that's as far as I go.

206
00:25:49,799 --> 00:25:51,592
As far as you go where?

207
00:25:53,044 --> 00:25:54,621
This issue is a drop in the bucket.

208
00:25:54,704 --> 00:25:56,606
I can talk to you about what's in here,
but I...

209
00:25:56,689 --> 00:25:58,474
I can't talk to you about anything else.

210
00:26:03,646 --> 00:26:06,858
I signed a confidentiality agreement.
I honor agreements.

211
00:26:10,870 --> 00:26:13,256
Doesn't CBS have confidentiality
agreements, Mr. Bergman?

212
00:26:13,781 --> 00:26:16,784
Between journalists and management,
yes, I believe they do.

213
00:26:17,493 --> 00:26:20,580
But I don't take that seriously.
Where do you work?

214
00:26:22,081 --> 00:26:23,833
- "Did work."
- Did work?

215
00:26:23,958 --> 00:26:26,377
How much would I get paid?

216
00:26:30,173 --> 00:26:33,760
That you have to discuss
with CBS Business Affairs.

217
00:26:33,843 --> 00:26:38,347
But for something like this, I would say
anywhere between $10, $12,000.

218
00:26:42,518 --> 00:26:44,479
Should I just take the documents now?

219
00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:47,190
If you want to do it.

220
00:26:55,031 --> 00:27:00,411
I worked as a head of Research and
Development for Brown & Williamson.

221
00:27:00,495 --> 00:27:02,038
Tobacco company.

222
00:27:06,375 --> 00:27:09,086
I was a corporate vice-president.

223
00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:12,340
Mr. Bergman.

224
00:27:40,401 --> 00:27:41,953
WALLACE ON TV: President Assad
of Syria

225
00:27:42,036 --> 00:27:44,497
said that difficult obstacles remain,

226
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:46,249
but that his country, quote,

227
00:27:46,332 --> 00:27:49,669
"looks forward to a great long peace
with Israel."

228
00:27:49,752 --> 00:27:52,463
That's a Peabody, Mike.

229
00:27:52,547 --> 00:27:53,714
When you're dead and buried,

230
00:27:53,798 --> 00:27:55,842
Hezbollah is the one
we're gonna remember you for.

231
00:27:58,052 --> 00:28:00,221
- Are you eating with us?
- Yeah.

232
00:28:00,304 --> 00:28:02,723
Bring a tie
so they let us in the front door.

233
00:28:04,141 --> 00:28:05,393
Come on.

234
00:28:13,484 --> 00:28:15,444
- Debbie!
- MAN: Hey, Lowell.

235
00:28:16,179 --> 00:28:18,590
Oh, Bill, Main Justice is investigating
a major New York bank

236
00:28:18,592 --> 00:28:20,919
laundering narco dollars
out of their Mexico City branch.

237
00:28:20,921 --> 00:28:22,322
You want it for the evening news?

238
00:28:22,324 --> 00:28:24,034
What about you?
You got a crew already?

239
00:28:24,036 --> 00:28:25,416
- I'm gonna do a follow-up.
- Okay.

240
00:28:25,418 --> 00:28:26,619
Catch you later.

241
00:28:32,336 --> 00:28:33,713
- Debbie.
- How are you?

242
00:28:33,963 --> 00:28:36,841
I want you to get Legal on
a corporate confidentiality agreement.

243
00:28:36,924 --> 00:28:37,967
Okay.

244
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:42,346
Boundaries of their constraint,
Kentucky state law about...

245
00:28:42,647 --> 00:28:44,257
- I want you to drop everything.
- Okay.

246
00:28:44,259 --> 00:28:46,052
I don't have any change.
You got some change?

247
00:28:46,054 --> 00:28:47,180
Here.

248
00:28:55,985 --> 00:28:57,361
Tony.

249
00:29:13,336 --> 00:29:15,963
MAN: Mr. Wigand, you can go up now.

250
00:29:39,362 --> 00:29:44,116
Sorry. I'm accepting an award from
the Retinitis Pigmentosa Foundation.

251
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:47,036
It's gonna kill the rest of my day.

252
00:29:53,042 --> 00:29:57,171
So, have you had a chance to play golf?

253
00:29:57,254 --> 00:30:00,966
Jeff's a premier golfer.
What are you, a two handicap?

254
00:30:02,051 --> 00:30:03,052
Seven.

255
00:30:03,135 --> 00:30:07,139
And he gets out there
and he has five strokes on us.

256
00:30:07,223 --> 00:30:10,434
He has more concentration
than anybody I've ever met.

257
00:30:10,518 --> 00:30:13,854
It's spooky how he can concentrate.

258
00:30:16,816 --> 00:30:18,943
I'd rather play than talk about it.

259
00:30:20,495 --> 00:30:21,862
What did you want to see me about?

260
00:30:23,572 --> 00:30:25,241
I don't like being back here.

261
00:30:25,825 --> 00:30:28,327
Jeffrey says exactly what's on his mind.

262
00:30:28,411 --> 00:30:31,163
Most people consider
what they're saying, social skills.

263
00:30:31,831 --> 00:30:34,125
Jeffrey just charges right ahead.

264
00:30:35,751 --> 00:30:39,380
Now, I know you understood the nature
of the confidentiality portion

265
00:30:39,463 --> 00:30:42,425
of your severance agreement
with Brown & Williamson.

266
00:30:42,508 --> 00:30:45,261
- Chapter and verse.
- Yeah, I know you do.

267
00:30:45,553 --> 00:30:49,390
You know, I came up through sales.

268
00:30:49,473 --> 00:30:51,726
One of the reasons
I was a great salesman

269
00:30:51,809 --> 00:30:54,812
was I never made a promise
I couldn't keep.

270
00:30:55,271 --> 00:30:59,859
I knew that if I ever broke my promise,
I'd suffer the consequence.

271
00:31:00,735 --> 00:31:02,319
Is that a threat?

272
00:31:03,738 --> 00:31:07,032
We worked together for,
what was it, three years?

273
00:31:07,116 --> 00:31:10,536
The work we did here is confidential,
not for public scrutiny

274
00:31:10,619 --> 00:31:12,288
any more than are one's family matters.

275
00:31:12,955 --> 00:31:14,582
You're threatening my family now, too?

276
00:31:15,875 --> 00:31:18,461
Now, don't be paranoid, Jeff.

277
00:31:18,544 --> 00:31:21,589
About the direction of research here,
we may have had our differences, but...

278
00:31:21,672 --> 00:31:23,474
Research.

279
00:31:23,558 --> 00:31:26,652
You declare as a badge of honor you
don't even know what makes water boil.

280
00:31:26,802 --> 00:31:29,305
Well, that's why we hire scientists.

281
00:31:29,388 --> 00:31:31,432
Okay.

282
00:31:32,808 --> 00:31:35,519
I don't believe that
you can maintain corporate integrity

283
00:31:35,603 --> 00:31:37,146
without confidentiality agreements.

284
00:31:38,481 --> 00:31:40,399
I was paid well for my work,

285
00:31:40,483 --> 00:31:43,611
the health and welfare benefits
are good,

286
00:31:43,694 --> 00:31:45,780
the severance package is fair.

287
00:31:47,072 --> 00:31:50,493
I have no intention of violating
my confidentiality agreement

288
00:31:50,576 --> 00:31:53,621
and disclosing that
which I said I wouldn't.

289
00:31:55,247 --> 00:31:57,666
I appreciate all that, Jeff,

290
00:31:57,750 --> 00:32:03,255
but upon reflection, we've decided
to expand our zone of comfort with you.

291
00:32:03,339 --> 00:32:06,467
So we've drafted a supplement
to your agreement.

292
00:32:07,718 --> 00:32:13,224
It broadly defines and expands
in more detail what is confidential.

293
00:32:13,307 --> 00:32:14,934
Nobody will be able to say,

294
00:32:15,017 --> 00:32:19,355
"Well, hell's bells, Margaret,
I didn't know that was a secret."

295
00:32:20,689 --> 00:32:22,942
We're very serious
about protecting our interests.

296
00:32:23,359 --> 00:32:24,860
We'd like you to sign it.

297
00:32:27,488 --> 00:32:29,615
And if I don't?

298
00:32:29,698 --> 00:32:33,035
If we arrive at the conclusion
that you're acting in bad faith,

299
00:32:33,119 --> 00:32:36,881
we would terminate right now
payoffs under your severance package,

300
00:32:36,964 --> 00:32:38,641
you and your family's medical benefits

301
00:32:38,724 --> 00:32:42,294
and initiate litigation against you,
Mr. Wigand.

302
00:32:43,754 --> 00:32:46,340
- Dr. Wigand.
- Dr. Wigand.

303
00:32:47,683 --> 00:32:49,093
If you've examined the document,

304
00:32:49,176 --> 00:32:52,805
you'll see it's in your own best interest
and you'll sign it.

305
00:32:59,478 --> 00:33:03,816
What you're saying is it isn't enough
that you fired me for no good reason.

306
00:33:03,899 --> 00:33:06,026
Now you question my integrity?

307
00:33:06,777 --> 00:33:09,029
On top of the humiliation of being fired,

308
00:33:09,113 --> 00:33:13,117
you threaten me,
you threaten my family?

309
00:33:14,326 --> 00:33:17,329
It never crossed my mind
not to honor my agreement.

310
00:33:17,413 --> 00:33:22,334
I will tell you, Mr. Sandefur, and
Brown & Williamson, too... "Fuck me"?

311
00:33:22,418 --> 00:33:23,669
Well, fuck you!

312
00:33:33,412 --> 00:33:34,880
I'm not sure he got the message.

313
00:33:36,974 --> 00:33:38,559
Oh, I think he did.

314
00:33:52,239 --> 00:33:53,699
- Yeah.
- You fucked me!

315
00:33:54,742 --> 00:33:55,868
Who's this?

316
00:33:56,452 --> 00:33:59,496
Protect your sources? You screwed me!
You sold me out!

317
00:34:01,215 --> 00:34:03,100
What are you talking about?
Where are you?

318
00:34:03,125 --> 00:34:04,460
Fuck you, too!

319
00:37:28,705 --> 00:37:30,499
Stay away from me.

320
00:37:32,501 --> 00:37:34,503
You stay away from me!

321
00:37:43,345 --> 00:37:46,014
Jeffrey, you forgot the lunches!

322
00:37:52,521 --> 00:37:54,398
- Mrs. Wigand?
- Jump in quick. Come on.

323
00:37:54,857 --> 00:37:58,110
How do you do? I'm Lowell Bergman.
We spoke on the phone.

324
00:38:00,671 --> 00:38:03,315
- Come here. I want to talk to you.
- Good. I want to talk to you.

325
00:38:03,817 --> 00:38:05,752
This is my house.
In front of my wife, my kids...

326
00:38:05,754 --> 00:38:08,632
I did not burn you.
I did not give you up to anyone.

327
00:38:09,079 --> 00:38:10,122
What business do we have?

328
00:38:10,205 --> 00:38:12,583
I'm here to straighten something out
with you.

329
00:38:12,666 --> 00:38:13,667
Right here, right now.

330
00:38:14,076 --> 00:38:15,277
You haven't mentioned my name?

331
00:38:15,279 --> 00:38:16,580
You haven't talked to anybody
about me?

332
00:38:16,582 --> 00:38:18,744
What am I gonna mention your name for...
Why are Brown & Williamson...

333
00:38:18,746 --> 00:38:20,556
How the hell do I know about
Brown & Williamson?

334
00:38:20,558 --> 00:38:23,203
It happened just after I talked to you!
I do not like coincidences!

335
00:38:23,277 --> 00:38:26,680
Well, I don't like paranoid accusations.
I'm a journalist.

336
00:38:26,763 --> 00:38:29,725
Think! Use your head!
How do I operate as a journalist?

337
00:38:29,808 --> 00:38:32,561
By screwing the people
who could provide me with information

338
00:38:32,644 --> 00:38:34,897
before they provided me with it?

339
00:38:35,490 --> 00:38:37,357
You came all the way down here
to tell me that?

340
00:38:37,441 --> 00:38:38,442
No, I did not.

341
00:38:38,859 --> 00:38:41,737
Big Tobacco is a big story
and you got something important to say.

342
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:42,988
I can tell.

343
00:38:43,530 --> 00:38:45,032
But yes, I did.

344
00:38:45,115 --> 00:38:49,703
I came all the way down here to tell you,
story, no story, fuck your story,

345
00:38:52,039 --> 00:38:53,707
I don't burn people.

346
00:39:26,031 --> 00:39:28,617
Ride with me
while I take the girls to school.

347
00:39:56,937 --> 00:39:58,814
WIGAND: My little girl
has acute asthma.

348
00:40:00,232 --> 00:40:02,818
Deborah, my oldest daughter.

349
00:40:02,901 --> 00:40:06,905
And I'm unemployed, so
I have to protect my medical coverage.

350
00:40:08,107 --> 00:40:09,741
So I left them a message this morning.

351
00:40:09,825 --> 00:40:12,369
Their expanded
confidentiality agreement...

352
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:17,207
I will sign it.

353
00:40:17,291 --> 00:40:19,835
- They're afraid of you, aren't they?
- They should be.

354
00:40:26,508 --> 00:40:29,595
Talk to me outside the zone
of your agreement.

355
00:40:29,678 --> 00:40:30,721
Like what?

356
00:40:30,804 --> 00:40:33,682
Like, where'd you work
before Brown & Williamson?

357
00:40:34,349 --> 00:40:38,228
Johnson & Johnson,
Union Carbide in Japan...

358
00:40:38,312 --> 00:40:41,815
I was the general manager and director
of new products. I speak Japanese.

359
00:40:41,898 --> 00:40:46,111
I was a director
of corporate development at Pfizer.

360
00:40:46,194 --> 00:40:47,738
All health-related.

361
00:40:51,158 --> 00:40:53,243
What else outside the zone?

362
00:40:55,462 --> 00:40:58,448
I don't know. Do you think the Knicks
are gonna make it to the semifinals?

363
00:41:11,553 --> 00:41:13,180
- Just give me an example.
- Okay.

364
00:41:13,263 --> 00:41:16,475
For example, James Burke.

365
00:41:16,558 --> 00:41:18,518
- CEO of Johnson & Johnson.
- Yeah.

366
00:41:18,602 --> 00:41:23,482
When he found out that some lunatic
had put poison in Tylenol bottles.

367
00:41:23,815 --> 00:41:25,117
He didn't argue with the FDA,

368
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:27,069
he didn't even wait for the FDA
to tell him,

369
00:41:27,152 --> 00:41:29,821
he just pulled Tylenol off
every shelf of every store

370
00:41:29,905 --> 00:41:32,199
right across America, instantly.

371
00:41:33,408 --> 00:41:35,869
And then he developed a safety cap.

372
00:41:35,952 --> 00:41:40,582
Because as a CEO, sure, he's gotta be
a great businessman, right?

373
00:41:40,665 --> 00:41:43,001
But he's also a man of science.

374
00:41:43,085 --> 00:41:45,337
He's not gonna allow his company
to put on the shelf

375
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:48,423
a product that might hurt people.

376
00:41:48,507 --> 00:41:50,592
Not like the Seven Dwarfs.

377
00:41:50,967 --> 00:41:52,970
- Seven Dwarfs?
- Seven CEOs of Big Tobacco.

378
00:41:52,972 --> 00:41:55,533
They got in front of Congress that time.
It was on television...

379
00:41:55,597 --> 00:41:56,790
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

380
00:41:56,873 --> 00:41:59,117
Swore under oath that they know
nothing about addiction...

381
00:41:59,201 --> 00:42:00,535
- It was on C-SPAN.
- Yeah.

382
00:42:00,619 --> 00:42:05,649
Okay, so, here you are.
You go to work for tobacco.

383
00:42:05,732 --> 00:42:08,610
You come from corporate cultures
where research,

384
00:42:08,694 --> 00:42:11,238
really creative thinking,
these are core values.

385
00:42:11,321 --> 00:42:14,741
You go to tobacco.
Tobacco is a sales culture,

386
00:42:14,825 --> 00:42:17,911
market and sell enormous volume,
go to a lot of golf tournaments.

387
00:42:18,203 --> 00:42:20,230
The hell with everything else.
What are you doing?

388
00:42:20,314 --> 00:42:22,140
Why are you working for tobacco
in the first place?

389
00:42:22,224 --> 00:42:24,292
I can't talk about it.

390
00:42:24,376 --> 00:42:25,877
The work I was supposed to do

391
00:42:25,961 --> 00:42:28,797
might have had some positive effect,
I don't know.

392
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:30,716
Could have been beneficial.

393
00:42:30,799 --> 00:42:35,345
Mostly, I got paid a lot.
I took the money.

394
00:42:35,929 --> 00:42:37,222
My wife was happy,

395
00:42:37,305 --> 00:42:40,350
my kids had good medical,
good schools, got a great house.

396
00:42:41,059 --> 00:42:42,561
I mean,
what the hell is wrong with that?

397
00:42:42,936 --> 00:42:45,230
Nothing's wrong with that. That's it.
You're making money.

398
00:42:45,313 --> 00:42:47,983
You're providing for your family.
What could be wrong with that?

399
00:42:51,069 --> 00:42:54,406
I always thought of myself as a man
of science, that's what's wrong with it.

400
00:42:56,950 --> 00:42:59,995
Then you're in a state of conflict, Jeff.

401
00:43:00,078 --> 00:43:02,748
Because, look, here's how it lays out.

402
00:43:02,831 --> 00:43:04,833
If you've got vital insider stuff,

403
00:43:04,916 --> 00:43:07,586
the American people, for their welfare,
really do need to know,

404
00:43:07,669 --> 00:43:11,298
and you feel impelled to disclose it
and violate your agreement in doing so,

405
00:43:11,381 --> 00:43:12,883
that's one thing.

406
00:43:12,966 --> 00:43:16,761
On the other hand,
if you want to honor this agreement,

407
00:43:16,845 --> 00:43:18,430
then that's simple.

408
00:43:18,513 --> 00:43:21,475
You do so.
You say nothing, you do nothing.

409
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:24,686
There's only one guy
who can figure that out for you,

410
00:43:24,769 --> 00:43:27,397
and that's you all by yourself.

411
00:43:33,695 --> 00:43:35,697
I gotta go pick up the girls.
They only had half a day.

412
00:43:55,383 --> 00:43:58,053
MAN: I've heard virtually all the...
We touched on it.

413
00:43:58,136 --> 00:44:00,347
Yes or no, do you believe
nicotine is not addictive?

414
00:44:00,430 --> 00:44:03,225
MAN 2: Congressman,
cigarettes and nicotine

415
00:44:03,308 --> 00:44:06,978
clearly do not meet
the classic definitions of addiction.

416
00:44:07,062 --> 00:44:08,355
There is no intoxication.

417
00:44:08,438 --> 00:44:09,731
CONGRESSMAN:
We'll take that as "no."

418
00:44:09,898 --> 00:44:11,983
Again, time is short.

419
00:44:12,067 --> 00:44:14,486
think each of you believe
nicotine is not addictive

420
00:44:14,569 --> 00:44:16,947
and just would like to have this
for the record.

421
00:44:18,073 --> 00:44:20,784
believe that nicotine is not addictive.

422
00:44:21,493 --> 00:44:23,161
, too, believe that nicotine...

423
00:44:23,703 --> 00:44:25,163
He referred to this...

424
00:44:25,247 --> 00:44:27,332
- The Seven Dwarfs.
- What Seven Dwarfs?

425
00:44:27,415 --> 00:44:29,793
The seven CEO of Big Tobacco.
Referred to this,

426
00:44:29,876 --> 00:44:33,797
said they should be afraid of him.
I assume afraid of what he could reveal.

427
00:44:34,256 --> 00:44:35,632
Now you tell me.

428
00:44:35,715 --> 00:44:38,593
What does this guy have to say
that threatens these people?

429
00:44:39,427 --> 00:44:41,680
Well, it isn't cigarettes are bad for you.

430
00:44:41,763 --> 00:44:43,265
- Hardly new news.
- No shit.

431
00:44:44,849 --> 00:44:46,101
What's this?

432
00:44:46,184 --> 00:44:49,521
What that is
is tobacco's standard defense.

433
00:44:49,604 --> 00:44:51,398
It's the "we don't know" litany.

434
00:44:51,481 --> 00:44:55,527
"Addiction? We believe not. Disease?
We don't know.

435
00:44:55,610 --> 00:44:58,530
"We take a bunch of leaves,
we roll them together, you smoke 'em.

436
00:44:58,613 --> 00:45:00,740
"After that, you're on your own.
We don't know."

437
00:45:01,825 --> 00:45:03,910
So, that tells me nothing.

438
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:07,205
- Besides, you'll never get what he's got.
- Why not?

439
00:45:07,289 --> 00:45:09,457
Because of this guy's
confidentiality agreement,

440
00:45:09,541 --> 00:45:11,626
he's never gonna be able to talk to you.

441
00:45:11,793 --> 00:45:14,546
That's not good enough.
This guy is the top scientist

442
00:45:14,629 --> 00:45:16,965
in the number-three tobacco company
in America.

443
00:45:17,048 --> 00:45:18,425
He's a corporate officer.

444
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:21,011
You never get whistle-blowers
from Fortune 500 companies.

445
00:45:21,177 --> 00:45:23,805
This guy is the ultimate insider.

446
00:45:23,889 --> 00:45:25,599
He's got something to say,
he wants to say it.

447
00:45:25,682 --> 00:45:27,809
- I want it on 60 Minutes.
- Doesn't matter what he wants.

448
00:45:27,811 --> 00:45:29,054
WALLACE: Am I missing
something here?

449
00:45:29,056 --> 00:45:30,098
What do you mean, Mike?

450
00:45:30,145 --> 00:45:32,731
He's got
a corporate secrecy agreement.

451
00:45:32,814 --> 00:45:34,816
Give me a break.

452
00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:38,570
This is a public health issue, like
an unsafe air frame on a passenger jet

453
00:45:38,653 --> 00:45:41,906
or some company dumping cyanide
into the East River.

454
00:45:41,990 --> 00:45:44,409
Issues like that.
He can talk, we can air it.

455
00:45:44,492 --> 00:45:47,829
They've got no right to hide behind
a corporate agreement. Pass the milk.

456
00:45:48,163 --> 00:45:50,582
They don't need the right.
They got the money.

457
00:45:50,665 --> 00:45:52,167
The unlimited checkbook.

458
00:45:52,250 --> 00:45:56,087
That's how Big Tobacco wins
every time on everything.

459
00:45:56,171 --> 00:45:57,797
They spend you to death.

460
00:45:58,048 --> 00:46:01,426
$600 million a year in outside legal.

461
00:46:01,509 --> 00:46:05,430
Chadbourne & Parke,
Ken Starr's firm, Kirkland and Ellis.

462
00:46:05,847 --> 00:46:11,269
Listen, GM and Ford, they get nailed
after 11 or 12 pickups blow up, right?

463
00:46:11,353 --> 00:46:14,564
- These clowns have never ever...
- MAN: Not even once.

464
00:46:14,648 --> 00:46:17,400
Not even with hundreds of thousands
dying each year

465
00:46:17,484 --> 00:46:19,549
from an illness related
to their product,

466
00:46:19,550 --> 00:46:21,613
have ever lost a
personal injury lawsuit.

467
00:46:22,072 --> 00:46:25,700
On this case, they'll issue gag orders,
sue for breach, anticipatory breach,

468
00:46:25,784 --> 00:46:30,038
enjoin him, you, us, his pet dog,
the dog's veterinarian,

469
00:46:30,330 --> 00:46:32,374
tie 'em up in litigation
for 10 or 15 years.

470
00:46:32,457 --> 00:46:35,043
I'm telling you,
they bat a thousand every time.

471
00:46:35,126 --> 00:46:37,337
He knows that.
That's why he's not gonna talk to you.

472
00:46:44,552 --> 00:46:48,056
Okay, let's look through
the looking glass the other way.

473
00:46:48,598 --> 00:46:49,849
What do you mean?

474
00:46:51,142 --> 00:46:53,228
We got a guy who wants to talk,
but he's constrained.

475
00:46:53,728 --> 00:46:57,232
- What if he were compelled to talk?
- Oh, torture. Great ratings.

476
00:46:57,315 --> 00:46:58,984
What do you mean, "compelled"?

477
00:46:59,067 --> 00:47:02,070
I mean
compelled by a Justice Department.

478
00:47:02,362 --> 00:47:04,447
State courts. Be a witness.

479
00:47:04,531 --> 00:47:07,742
That would cut through any
confidentiality agreement, wouldn't it?

480
00:47:07,909 --> 00:47:09,828
- What does that do?
- What do you mean, what does it do?

481
00:47:09,911 --> 00:47:13,081
What I mean is like, how does it cut
through the confidentiality agreement?

482
00:47:13,248 --> 00:47:16,710
Because he has to reveal it
in a court of law.

483
00:47:16,793 --> 00:47:19,337
It's on record. It's out.
It's no secret anymore.

484
00:47:19,421 --> 00:47:23,007
So how can they restrain his speech
or retaliate? It's out in the world.

485
00:47:23,091 --> 00:47:25,760
If you could engineer it into the court
record, you might have something.

486
00:47:25,853 --> 00:47:27,539
They would have a hell
of a time trying to

487
00:47:27,540 --> 00:47:29,147
restrain his speech
then, wouldn't they?

488
00:47:29,230 --> 00:47:30,640
Yeah, but what venue?

489
00:47:30,724 --> 00:47:32,967
And where does he get...
Does he have killer attorneys?

490
00:47:33,935 --> 00:47:35,854
I don't think he's got any attorneys.

491
00:47:35,937 --> 00:47:39,482
He's gonna need attorneys who aren't
afraid of risking years of litigation

492
00:47:39,566 --> 00:47:43,528
and millions of dollars
of their own dough in legal costs.

493
00:47:44,362 --> 00:47:46,781
What do you say, Mike?
What do you think?

494
00:47:48,992 --> 00:47:51,202
Even if he gets the defense team,

495
00:47:55,915 --> 00:47:57,500
will he go for it?

496
00:48:04,674 --> 00:48:07,469
You're awfully overqualified,
Dr. Wigand.

497
00:48:14,350 --> 00:48:16,811
I'm trying to start a new career.

498
00:48:18,813 --> 00:48:21,483
I believe I could be a good teacher.

499
00:48:25,737 --> 00:48:27,197
Let me give it some thought.

500
00:48:32,243 --> 00:48:34,329
And not a lot of companies
in the healthcare field

501
00:48:34,412 --> 00:48:36,956
hire ex-tobacco scientists.

502
00:49:10,740 --> 00:49:12,367
That's it.

503
00:49:21,292 --> 00:49:23,545
It's where our babies were born.

504
00:49:27,799 --> 00:49:30,760
Debbie took her first steps
right there on...

505
00:49:32,387 --> 00:49:33,972
In the grass.

506
00:49:37,392 --> 00:49:40,228
- I didn't plan on this.
- Hey, hey, hey.

507
00:49:41,062 --> 00:49:42,897
Come on. Come on.

508
00:49:47,235 --> 00:49:51,072
We can make this work for us, okay?

509
00:49:51,155 --> 00:49:53,199
It's just, it's not...

510
00:49:53,283 --> 00:49:56,327
It's a smaller scale.

511
00:49:56,411 --> 00:50:01,833
Simpler, easier, more time.

512
00:50:01,916 --> 00:50:06,713
More time together,
more time with the kids.

513
00:50:06,796 --> 00:50:09,632
More time for us, okay? It's just...

514
00:50:12,510 --> 00:50:16,347
Can you imagine me coming home
from some job

515
00:50:16,431 --> 00:50:19,058
feeling good at the end of the day?

516
00:50:21,185 --> 00:50:22,770
This is gonna be better.

517
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:26,524
This is gonna be better.

518
00:50:46,461 --> 00:50:49,255

524
00:51:15,531 --> 00:51:17,742
- Back to...
- WOMAN ON RADIO: Welcome back.

525
00:51:33,299 --> 00:51:35,718
Hey, baby. What's wrong?

526
00:51:35,802 --> 00:51:37,929
Who's that outside, Daddy?

527
00:51:40,139 --> 00:51:41,808
Did you see somebody
or did you hear them?

528
00:51:41,891 --> 00:51:43,226
I heard him.

529
00:51:44,811 --> 00:51:47,063
- Where?
- In the backyard.

530
00:52:04,038 --> 00:52:07,583
Sit at Daddy's desk, okay?
Why don't you sit up at the desk.

531
00:52:07,667 --> 00:52:08,960
All right?

532
00:52:09,043 --> 00:52:12,046
Get out some paper,
and draw me a picture, okay?

533
00:52:18,386 --> 00:52:22,765
What are you gonna draw me, baby?
An animal? Something like that?

534
00:52:23,474 --> 00:52:26,060
You stay down here until
Daddy gets back, all right, Barbara?

535
00:52:26,144 --> 00:52:27,353
You stay down here.

536
00:53:25,453 --> 00:53:27,789
You almost got your damn head
blown off.

537
00:54:07,453 --> 00:54:09,080
Daddy!

538
00:54:10,581 --> 00:54:14,293
It was just a raccoon, baby. Nothin'.

539
00:54:14,377 --> 00:54:16,921
They're nocturnal.
You know what that means?

540
00:54:17,004 --> 00:54:19,465
That means that
they only come out at nighttime.

541
00:54:32,979 --> 00:54:36,190
- Yeah.
- Lowell. Jeffrey Wigand.

542
00:54:37,191 --> 00:54:39,443
Is it too late?

543
00:54:40,153 --> 00:54:42,029
No, no, it's okay. I...

544
00:54:42,363 --> 00:54:46,200
- How's the new place?
- The new place? New.

545
00:54:46,701 --> 00:54:47,910
You okay?

546
00:54:48,536 --> 00:54:50,121
Sure.

547
00:54:50,204 --> 00:54:53,666
was thinking
of calling you tomorrow anyway.

548
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:57,086
How's your kids
handling the new house?

549
00:54:57,170 --> 00:54:58,171
Good.

550
00:54:58,671 --> 00:55:01,340
- You got kids?
- We have a couple.

551
00:55:01,757 --> 00:55:05,511
One's hers, one's mine.
Everybody uses a different name.

552
00:55:05,595 --> 00:55:07,305
Modern marriage.

553
00:55:08,514 --> 00:55:09,849
How's Liane?

554
00:55:12,059 --> 00:55:13,686
She's okay.

555
00:55:15,104 --> 00:55:16,772
Hold on a minute.

556
00:55:23,738 --> 00:55:27,825
Lowell, somebody may be following me.
I don't know.

557
00:55:28,159 --> 00:55:29,619
They came on the property

558
00:55:29,702 --> 00:55:32,705
What do you mean, following you?
Did you call the police?

559
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:35,583
I don't wanna be paranoid. I mean...

560
00:55:36,083 --> 00:55:38,085
Maybe it's a game.
Some kind of mind game.

561
00:55:38,169 --> 00:55:39,420
What do you really think?

562
00:55:39,670 --> 00:55:41,672
I don't know what the fuck I really think.

563
00:55:41,756 --> 00:55:45,176
Are they doing it?
Is some crank doing it?

564
00:55:45,259 --> 00:55:46,761
Are they doing it
to make me feel paranoid?

565
00:55:47,011 --> 00:55:49,639
Are they doing it for real and don't
give a shit what I think? I don't know.

566
00:55:49,972 --> 00:55:51,098
I don't fuckin' know.

567
00:55:51,224 --> 00:55:54,477
Jeffrey, describe for me in detail
what happened.

568
00:55:55,061 --> 00:55:56,854
Well...

569
00:55:56,938 --> 00:56:00,483
No. Look, I mean, there was a footprint.
Forget it.

570
00:56:00,775 --> 00:56:04,111
It's probably not important at all.
You know, I got a job now.

571
00:56:04,445 --> 00:56:07,573
I'm teaching high school.
Japanese and chemistry.

572
00:56:10,868 --> 00:56:13,079
So what were you calling about?

573
00:56:13,162 --> 00:56:14,455
You called me.

574
00:56:14,538 --> 00:56:16,249
No, you said
you were gonna call me tomorrow.

575
00:56:16,332 --> 00:56:18,551
- So, what about?
- Oh, yes, yes, yes. I did.

576
00:56:18,634 --> 00:56:20,703
I wanted to talk to you.
I wanted to hook up with you,

577
00:56:20,786 --> 00:56:23,914
talk to you about
what we were talking about in your car.

578
00:56:27,051 --> 00:56:28,135
Okay.

579
00:56:28,803 --> 00:56:31,889
It makes you feel good,
putting what you know to use?

580
00:56:34,475 --> 00:56:37,228
- How'd you know that, Lowell?
- It's obvious, isn't it?

581
00:56:40,690 --> 00:56:42,650
Hello? Are you there?

582
00:56:43,025 --> 00:56:44,569
Yeah.

583
00:56:45,653 --> 00:56:47,697
Look...

584
00:56:48,155 --> 00:56:51,284
Thanks for talking.
I'm sorry I woke you up. I didn't know...

585
00:56:51,993 --> 00:56:53,577
It's okay.

586
00:57:03,170 --> 00:57:04,588
Lowell.

587
00:57:07,258 --> 00:57:08,342
Who is this?

588
00:57:09,260 --> 00:57:11,095
Do not call here! Do not...

589
00:57:35,870 --> 00:57:38,497
- What are you gonna get us?
- Tempura.

590
00:57:44,045 --> 00:57:46,339
The Internet said
you did graduate work at Wisconsin,

591
00:57:46,422 --> 00:57:50,384
then went to UC La Jolla
with Professor Herbert? Marcus...

592
00:57:50,468 --> 00:57:52,136
- Marcuse.
- Yeah.

593
00:57:52,219 --> 00:57:54,680
He was my mentor.

594
00:57:54,764 --> 00:57:58,142
He had a major influence
on the New Left in the late '60s.

595
00:57:58,225 --> 00:58:00,936
- And on me, personally.
- Next to your father?

596
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:05,024
My father? What the hell's that
got to do with my father?

597
00:58:07,318 --> 00:58:09,487
I, uh...

598
00:58:09,570 --> 00:58:13,407
Is that why you became a journalist?
Then you get to ask all the questions?

599
00:58:13,866 --> 00:58:15,326
You charge by the hour?

600
00:58:17,078 --> 00:58:19,664
My father was a
mechanical engineer.

601
00:58:19,747 --> 00:58:22,041
Most ingenious man I ever knew.

602
00:58:22,124 --> 00:58:24,001
My father left us
when I was five-years-old.

603
00:58:24,085 --> 00:58:25,753
He was not the most ingenious man
I ever knew.

604
00:58:25,836 --> 00:58:27,880
Let's get back to Brown & Williamson.

605
00:58:28,923 --> 00:58:30,549
If you decide to go on 60 Minutes,

606
00:58:31,342 --> 00:58:33,803
I gotta know everything
about why you were fired.

607
00:58:34,512 --> 00:58:35,554
Why?

608
00:58:36,555 --> 00:58:38,349
They're gonna dig up stuff
from your past,

609
00:58:38,432 --> 00:58:40,726
they're gonna throw it at you.
I gotta know what they're gonna throw.

610
00:58:41,727 --> 00:58:43,229
You understand?

611
00:58:46,607 --> 00:58:48,609
I drink.

612
00:58:48,693 --> 00:58:50,695
Couple of occasions,
more than I should have.

613
00:58:50,778 --> 00:58:52,071
Mmm-hmm.

614
00:58:54,740 --> 00:58:58,077
I was cited for shoplifting once,
but it was a mistake.

615
00:59:01,205 --> 00:59:02,440
Pushed Liane one time.

616
00:59:02,442 --> 00:59:04,418
We were both stressed out
because of the pressure.

617
00:59:04,420 --> 00:59:06,622
She went to her mother's.

618
00:59:06,669 --> 00:59:09,380
I got fired

619
00:59:09,989 --> 00:59:12,466
because when I get angry,
I have difficulty censoring myself,

620
00:59:12,550 --> 00:59:15,136
and I don't like to be pushed around.

621
00:59:15,719 --> 00:59:18,431
I'm not pushing you around.
I'm asking you questions.

622
00:59:21,517 --> 00:59:24,562
I'm just a commodity to you, aren't I?

623
00:59:24,645 --> 00:59:25,963
I could be anything, right?

624
00:59:26,047 --> 00:59:27,898
Anything worth putting on
between commercials.

625
00:59:27,982 --> 00:59:29,984
To a network,
probably we're all commodities.

626
00:59:30,067 --> 00:59:32,319
To me, you're not a commodity.
What you are is important.

627
00:59:34,655 --> 00:59:37,825
You go public, and 30 million people
hear what you gotta say,

628
00:59:37,908 --> 00:59:41,495
nothing, I mean nothing,
will ever be the same again.

629
00:59:41,579 --> 00:59:42,663
You believe that?

630
00:59:42,747 --> 00:59:44,123
- No.
- You should.

631
00:59:44,915 --> 00:59:45,916
Because when you're done,

632
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:49,712
the judgment is gonna go down in
the court of public opinion, my friend.

633
00:59:51,046 --> 00:59:52,965
And that's the power you have.

634
00:59:54,258 --> 00:59:57,511
- You believe that?
- I believe that? Yes, I believe that.

635
00:59:57,845 --> 00:59:59,764
You believe that because
you get information out to people,

636
00:59:59,847 --> 01:00:01,390
- something happens?
- Yes.

637
01:00:01,515 --> 01:00:03,642
Maybe that's just what you've been
telling yourself all these years

638
01:00:03,726 --> 01:00:05,144
to justify having a good job.

639
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:08,022
Having status.

640
01:00:08,647 --> 01:00:10,149
Maybe for the audience,
it's just voyeurism.

641
01:00:10,232 --> 01:00:11,358
Something to do on a Sunday night.

642
01:00:11,525 --> 01:00:13,652
Maybe it won't change a fuckin' thing,

643
01:00:13,736 --> 01:00:16,155
and people like myself and my family

644
01:00:16,238 --> 01:00:20,117
are left hung out to dry, used up,
broke, alone.

645
01:00:20,659 --> 01:00:23,287
Are you talking to me, or did somebody
else just walk in here? I never...

646
01:00:25,247 --> 01:00:29,210
Don't evade a choice you gotta make
by questioning my reputation

647
01:00:29,293 --> 01:00:31,545
or 60 Minutes
with this cheap skepticism.

648
01:00:31,629 --> 01:00:34,398
I have to put my family's welfare
on the line here, my friend.

649
01:00:34,482 --> 01:00:36,258
What are you putting up?
You're putting up words.

650
01:00:36,342 --> 01:00:37,343
"Words."

651
01:00:37,927 --> 01:00:40,638
While you've been clicking around some
fucking company golf tournaments,

652
01:00:40,721 --> 01:00:45,059
I've been out in the world givin' my word
and backing it up with action.

653
01:00:50,356 --> 01:00:53,025
Now, are you gonna go
and do this thing or not?

654
01:00:55,694 --> 01:00:57,988
I said I'd call the kids
before they went to bed.

655
01:01:11,127 --> 01:01:12,878
BERGMAN: Stringer was
supposed to be shooting

656
01:01:12,962 --> 01:01:14,797
B-roll on street cops in New Orleans.

657
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:16,131
What's with all the horses?

658
01:01:16,215 --> 01:01:18,175
MAN: Camera guy's got a thing
about mounted police.

659
01:01:18,551 --> 01:01:21,971
Don't any of these guys ride in cars?
Walk?

660
01:01:22,137 --> 01:01:24,098
- How long are these things?
- What was he saying?

661
01:01:24,181 --> 01:01:26,642
Hello. Yes, I'm trying to reach
Mr. Richard Scruggs.

662
01:01:27,851 --> 01:01:29,311
This is Richard Scruggs.

663
01:01:29,812 --> 01:01:31,355
Can you hold on a second, please?

664
01:01:31,438 --> 01:01:33,357
Lowell, got him on the phone.

665
01:01:37,319 --> 01:01:38,362
Hello, I'm Lowell Bergman.

666
01:01:38,654 --> 01:01:44,326
Hold on. Mobile Approach,
this is Leo-November-643. Over.

667
01:01:46,787 --> 01:01:51,208
Request a flight level of 220
on a heading of 284 degrees. Over.

668
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:54,169
Mr. Bergman?

669
01:01:54,628 --> 01:01:56,964
Yes, I'm right here.
Could you call me back on a hard line?

670
01:01:57,298 --> 01:01:58,340
All right.

671
01:01:58,465 --> 01:02:02,386
Area code 212-555-0199.

672
01:02:02,469 --> 01:02:03,637
I'll call you then.

673
01:02:11,979 --> 01:02:13,397
- What do we do with that?
- I don't know.

674
01:02:15,232 --> 01:02:16,817
Richard Scruggs.

675
01:02:16,900 --> 01:02:20,154
You filed a lawsuit against tobacco
on behalf of the State of Mississippi.

676
01:02:20,529 --> 01:02:22,406
- Did you not?
- That's right.

677
01:02:22,489 --> 01:02:23,741
I'm working with someone now

678
01:02:23,824 --> 01:02:27,036
who's the former head of research
at Brown & Williamson.

679
01:02:27,119 --> 01:02:29,330
Former corporate officer there.

680
01:02:29,830 --> 01:02:31,665
What's your interest in this,
Mr. Bergman?

681
01:02:32,625 --> 01:02:34,376
Well, he may tape an interview with us,

682
01:02:34,460 --> 01:02:37,796
and we believe if his testimony
showed up in a court record first,

683
01:02:38,047 --> 01:02:39,798
it would free him up
from his confidentiality agreement

684
01:02:39,882 --> 01:02:41,717
and give him some protection.

685
01:02:41,800 --> 01:02:44,720
It could work.
If it's public record, it's public record.

686
01:02:44,803 --> 01:02:47,097
Yeah, and
he's gonna need legal representation.

687
01:02:47,181 --> 01:02:48,891
He sure as hell will.

688
01:02:50,017 --> 01:02:51,936
Has he decided to go public?

689
01:02:52,227 --> 01:02:55,522
Because let me tell ya,
we been doin' this for three years now,

690
01:02:55,606 --> 01:02:57,316
and we've worked
with a lot of corporate cases

691
01:02:57,399 --> 01:02:58,400
involving whistle-blowers.

692
01:02:58,817 --> 01:03:02,071
So we know Big Tobacco will do
everything in their power to stop him.

693
01:03:02,738 --> 01:03:05,240
So is your man truly committed?

694
01:03:05,324 --> 01:03:08,452
Well, actually, no. He's on the fence.
That's the point.

695
01:03:11,288 --> 01:03:14,792
Well, we'd certainly be interested
in making his acquaintance.

696
01:03:14,875 --> 01:03:16,752
But without knowing
what he's gonna do...

697
01:03:17,586 --> 01:03:20,130
Would you want him to call you,
or you wanna call him?

698
01:03:20,214 --> 01:03:21,298
How do you wanna do it?

699
01:03:21,382 --> 01:03:23,634
It would be better if he called us.

700
01:03:23,717 --> 01:03:25,678
- Yeah. Okay.
- All right?

701
01:03:25,761 --> 01:03:27,888
Okay, thank you. Shit.

702
01:03:32,476 --> 01:03:34,603
We need cops on the streets.
We don't need them on horses.

703
01:03:34,770 --> 01:03:36,522
- I don't know what he was thinking.
- For God's sake.

704
01:03:36,605 --> 01:03:38,399
- This guy got a horse fetish?
- All right, all right.

705
01:03:38,649 --> 01:03:40,818
Get me to New Orleans this afternoon.

706
01:03:41,819 --> 01:03:44,071
I'll shoot the fucking thing myself!

707
01:03:44,738 --> 01:03:46,657
- Have a good one.
- MAN: All right.

708
01:04:08,137 --> 01:04:09,304
BARBARA: What are you cooking?

709
01:04:09,555 --> 01:04:12,891
- I'm cooking pasta primavera.
- Oh, I love that stuff.

710
01:04:17,062 --> 01:04:19,440
I'm going to have to go downstairs.

711
01:04:51,055 --> 01:04:52,347
Jeffrey!

712
01:05:14,828 --> 01:05:16,914
Jeffrey! Jeffrey!

713
01:05:17,539 --> 01:05:19,625
Jeffrey! Jeffrey!

714
01:05:48,904 --> 01:05:50,030
BERGMAN: What happened?

715
01:05:50,114 --> 01:05:52,449
Dispatcher received a call
of shots fired in the area.

716
01:05:52,533 --> 01:05:57,204
Uniforms arrived on the scene, found
this white male subject shot to death.

717
01:05:57,412 --> 01:05:59,122
Was it gang-related?

718
01:05:59,206 --> 01:06:02,501
There's no indication
as far as a tag or an advertisement.

719
01:06:05,629 --> 01:06:07,965
Yeah.

720
01:06:09,508 --> 01:06:12,219
They're terrorizing us. Death threats.
My family, my kids.

721
01:06:12,845 --> 01:06:14,012
What are you talking about?

722
01:06:14,096 --> 01:06:15,722
Someone put a bullet in my mailbox.

723
01:06:16,139 --> 01:06:19,893
- Jeff, call the FBI right away.
- They do this with impunity.

724
01:06:20,185 --> 01:06:21,186
Jeff...

725
01:06:21,270 --> 01:06:22,688
They get to go home at night.

726
01:06:22,771 --> 01:06:25,440
What does it cost these people
to do this to us? Nothing!

727
01:06:27,234 --> 01:06:29,903
My girls are crying. So fuck them.

728
01:06:30,070 --> 01:06:32,155
- wanna tape. I'm done...
- I heard you.

729
01:06:32,239 --> 01:06:34,408
I gotta arrange for a legal defense first.

730
01:06:34,908 --> 01:06:38,036
gotta get you to testify in court,
get it on public record.

731
01:06:38,120 --> 01:06:40,873
Then hold it off the air until you
got that, but I wanna go to New York,

732
01:06:40,956 --> 01:06:43,375
and I wanna go on the record right now.

733
01:06:44,585 --> 01:06:46,003
Good. But, Jeff...

734
01:06:46,253 --> 01:06:48,005
I'll call them, Lowell.

735
01:06:53,385 --> 01:06:54,720
Did you handle the round, Mr. Wigand?

736
01:06:57,222 --> 01:06:58,473
Yes, I'm afraid I did.

737
01:06:59,266 --> 01:07:01,226
We won't be able to lift usable prints.

738
01:07:03,604 --> 01:07:04,855
Do you own a gun, Mr. Wigand?

739
01:07:07,274 --> 01:07:09,484
- A gun? Yes.
- What caliber is your gun?

740
01:07:11,778 --> 01:07:12,905
What caliber is my gun?

741
01:07:13,405 --> 01:07:15,866
Yes, sir. What caliber is your gun?

742
01:07:16,700 --> 01:07:18,952
What does that have to do
with the price of tea in China?

743
01:07:22,039 --> 01:07:25,125
You think I put the bullet
in the mailbox myself?

744
01:07:26,168 --> 01:07:28,128
If we could take a look, Mr. Wigand.

745
01:07:41,892 --> 01:07:43,101
Why do you keep this gun?

746
01:07:43,185 --> 01:07:47,147
I don't think it's unconstitutional yet
to own a gun. I'm a target shooter.

747
01:07:47,231 --> 01:07:50,609
That bullet was for a .38 caliber.
Do you own a .38?

748
01:07:50,692 --> 01:07:53,445
Yes, I do. A .38 Target Master
in my gun safe downstairs.

749
01:07:53,528 --> 01:07:57,115
A .45 Gold Cup, a .22 target pistol.
So what?

750
01:07:58,659 --> 01:08:01,495
Do you have a history
of emotional problems, Mr. Wigand?

751
01:08:01,870 --> 01:08:03,705
Yeah. Yes, I do.

752
01:08:03,789 --> 01:08:07,501
Yes, I get extremely emotional when
assholes put bullets in my mailbox.

753
01:08:08,043 --> 01:08:11,421
I didn't tell you that so
you could pick it up and take it away.

754
01:08:11,505 --> 01:08:12,673
Jeffrey!

755
01:08:12,965 --> 01:08:14,049
What's going on?

756
01:08:14,500 --> 01:08:16,718
I told them you had
an e-mail death threat that told you

757
01:08:16,720 --> 01:08:18,521
if you didn't shut the "F" up,
they were gonna kill you.

758
01:08:18,523 --> 01:08:20,282
You can't take that.
It's personal property.

759
01:08:20,364 --> 01:08:23,492
My personal correspondence,
letters to my brother, my will.

760
01:08:36,196 --> 01:08:37,531
You all right?

761
01:08:47,457 --> 01:08:49,793
That computer has every single...

762
01:08:50,961 --> 01:08:52,713
AGENT: You all right, Mr. Wigand?

763
01:08:52,921 --> 01:08:55,549
We need to take a look
at your gun safe, Mr. Wigand.

764
01:09:12,941 --> 01:09:17,362
I'm telling you your agents
in that office are acting improperly.

765
01:09:17,446 --> 01:09:18,697
Now who are they trying to protect?

766
01:09:19,072 --> 01:09:20,657
Let me tell you something, Lowell.
Look, look.

767
01:09:20,741 --> 01:09:23,160
You're talking about two agents
in a regional office in Louisville.

768
01:09:23,243 --> 01:09:27,247
I got the goddamned Unabomber
threatening to blow up LAX.

769
01:09:27,622 --> 01:09:30,625
gotta move 45 agents
from all over the country into LA.

770
01:09:31,001 --> 01:09:32,627
All right?
When I get a chance, I'll give it a look.

771
01:09:32,711 --> 01:09:35,672
You better take a good look
because I'm getting two things.

772
01:09:35,756 --> 01:09:38,050
Pissed off and curious!

773
01:09:38,133 --> 01:09:42,637
Any of these guys been offered jobs
in corporate security after they retire?

774
01:09:42,846 --> 01:09:46,308
Either one of those guys got
ex-agent pals already in those jobs?

775
01:09:46,391 --> 01:09:49,686
Like, for instance, their ex-supervisor
who's already at Brown & Williamson

776
01:09:49,770 --> 01:09:51,146
as we fuckin' speak!

777
01:09:51,688 --> 01:09:52,773
I'll give it a look.

778
01:09:52,981 --> 01:09:54,941
- You're getting my drift?
- ' give it a look.

779
01:09:57,110 --> 01:09:58,904
BERGMAN: So is everything okay?

780
01:10:00,989 --> 01:10:03,283
- How are the rooms? Comfortable?
- Yes, very.

781
01:10:04,242 --> 01:10:07,204
Do you know,
I enjoy your work so much.

782
01:10:07,287 --> 01:10:10,832
When you're talkin' to somebody,
I always feel like I'm right there.

783
01:10:11,041 --> 01:10:12,959
Thank you
for saying that.

784
01:10:13,835 --> 01:10:15,212
Do you think we could talk
about the taping?

785
01:10:15,837 --> 01:10:17,089
Tomorrow's taping?

786
01:10:17,172 --> 01:10:19,674
Just so we can get it
out of the way and order.

787
01:10:20,258 --> 01:10:23,553
Yeah, well, questions will go
towards what work you did there,

788
01:10:23,637 --> 01:10:26,139
- why you were fired and other...
- Taping?

789
01:10:31,103 --> 01:10:32,229
What are you taping?

790
01:10:33,480 --> 01:10:35,148
I'm doin' an interview.

791
01:10:38,276 --> 01:10:39,903
An interview?

792
01:10:45,909 --> 01:10:50,163
Do you know what they will do to us?
I thought we...

793
01:10:54,543 --> 01:10:55,585
I'm sorry.

794
01:10:56,670 --> 01:10:58,630
Liane, this is a preliminary...

795
01:11:08,140 --> 01:11:10,016
You didn't tell her we were taping?

796
01:11:11,434 --> 01:11:13,270
What did she think she was
coming to New York for?

797
01:11:15,313 --> 01:11:18,692
Talk about it, think about it.
I had a plan to ease her into it,

798
01:11:18,775 --> 01:11:20,861
but I really don't know how to do that.

799
01:11:27,701 --> 01:11:29,202
Oh, man.

800
01:11:34,040 --> 01:11:35,667
Who are these people?

801
01:11:38,920 --> 01:11:41,715
Ordinary people under
extraordinary pressure, Mike.

802
01:11:43,717 --> 01:11:46,386
What the hell you expect,
grace and consistency?

803
01:12:15,165 --> 01:12:18,752
STAGE MANAGER:
Five, four, three, two...

804
01:12:20,295 --> 01:12:24,007
WALLACE: You heard Mr. Sandefur
say before Congress

805
01:12:24,090 --> 01:12:27,344
that he believed
nicotine was not addictive.

806
01:12:27,427 --> 01:12:30,388
I believe Mr. Sandefur perjured himself

807
01:12:30,472 --> 01:12:32,390
because I watched those testimonies
very carefully.

808
01:12:32,474 --> 01:12:34,184
WALLACE: All of us did.

809
01:12:34,267 --> 01:12:36,686
I mean,
there was this whole line of people,

810
01:12:36,770 --> 01:12:39,231
whole line of CEOs up there,
all swearing.

811
01:12:39,314 --> 01:12:43,193
Part of the reason I'm here is that I felt

812
01:12:43,276 --> 01:12:45,862
that their representation
clearly misstated,

813
01:12:45,946 --> 01:12:47,906
at least within
Brown & Williamson's representation,

814
01:12:47,989 --> 01:12:52,285
clearly misstated what is
common language within the company.

815
01:12:52,369 --> 01:12:54,538
We are in
the nicotine delivery business.

816
01:12:55,288 --> 01:12:56,623
And that's what cigarettes are for.

817
01:12:57,290 --> 01:12:58,875
Delivery device for nicotine.

818
01:12:58,959 --> 01:13:01,211
A delivery device for nicotine.

819
01:13:01,294 --> 01:13:04,089
Put it in your mouth, light it up
and you're going to get your fix.

820
01:13:04,256 --> 01:13:05,382
You're gonna get your fix.

821
01:13:06,132 --> 01:13:09,094
You're saying that Brown & Williamson

822
01:13:09,177 --> 01:13:12,013
manipulates and adjusts
the nicotine fix

823
01:13:12,097 --> 01:13:16,893
not by artificially adding nicotine,
but by enhancing the effect of nicotine

824
01:13:16,977 --> 01:13:21,064
through the use of chemical elements
such as ammonia.

825
01:13:21,940 --> 01:13:23,942
The process is known
as impact boosting.

826
01:13:24,734 --> 01:13:28,780
While not spiking nicotine,
they clearly manipulate it.

827
01:13:29,990 --> 01:13:31,616
There is extensive use
of this technology,

828
01:13:31,700 --> 01:13:32,993
known as ammonia chemistry.

829
01:13:34,452 --> 01:13:38,164
It allows for the nicotine to be
more rapidly absorbed in the lung

830
01:13:38,248 --> 01:13:40,542
and therefore affect
the brain and central nervous system.

831
01:13:45,005 --> 01:13:46,590
The straw that broke
the camel's back for me

832
01:13:46,673 --> 01:13:48,550
and really put me in trouble
with Sandefur,

833
01:13:48,633 --> 01:13:51,553
was a compound called "coumarin."

834
01:13:51,636 --> 01:13:53,555
When I came on board at B&W,

835
01:13:53,680 --> 01:13:58,268
they had tried to transition
from coumarin to a similar flavor

836
01:13:58,351 --> 01:14:00,312
that would give the same taste
and had been unsuccessful.

837
01:14:02,063 --> 01:14:03,898
I wanted it out immediately.

838
01:14:03,982 --> 01:14:08,528
I was told that it would affect sales,
so I should mind my own business.

839
01:14:09,863 --> 01:14:13,116
I constructed a memo to Mr. Sandefur
indicating I could not in conscience

840
01:14:13,199 --> 01:14:15,702
continue with coumarin in a product
that we now knew,

841
01:14:15,785 --> 01:14:17,621
we had documentation,

842
01:14:17,704 --> 01:14:20,373
was similar to Coumadin,
a lung-specific carcinogen.

843
01:14:20,457 --> 01:14:22,375
And you sent the document
forward to Sandefur?

844
01:14:22,459 --> 01:14:24,919
I sent the document forward
to Sandefur.

845
01:14:25,003 --> 01:14:27,380
I was told that we would continue
to work on a substitute.

846
01:14:28,214 --> 01:14:29,299
We weren't going to remove it

847
01:14:29,382 --> 01:14:32,469
as it would impact sales
and that that was his decision.

848
01:14:32,552 --> 01:14:37,140
In other words, you are charging
Sandefur and Brown & Williamson

849
01:14:37,223 --> 01:14:39,559
with ignoring
health considerations consciously?

850
01:14:42,062 --> 01:14:43,229
Most certainly.

851
01:14:43,313 --> 01:14:44,647
And on March 24,

852
01:14:44,731 --> 01:14:49,861
Thomas Sandefur, CEO
of Brown & Williamson, had you fired.

853
01:14:52,656 --> 01:14:54,574
And the reason he gave you?

854
01:14:56,618 --> 01:14:58,453
Poor communication skills.

855
01:15:01,039 --> 01:15:03,166
And you wish you hadn't come forward?

856
01:15:04,668 --> 01:15:06,753
You wish you hadn't blown the whistle?

857
01:15:08,797 --> 01:15:11,174
Yeah, there are times
I wish I hadn't done it.

858
01:15:13,093 --> 01:15:16,388
There are times I feel compelled to do it.

859
01:15:18,348 --> 01:15:22,769
If you'd asked me, would I do it again,
do I think it's worth it?

860
01:15:26,898 --> 01:15:28,483
Yeah, I think it's worth it.

861
01:16:02,183 --> 01:16:04,769
- Hi.
- STUDENTS: Hi.

862
01:16:05,562 --> 01:16:07,814
My name is Jeff Wigand.

863
01:16:10,358 --> 01:16:14,696
You can call me "Mr. Wigand,"
you can call me "Dr. Wigand."

864
01:16:14,779 --> 01:16:18,283
I have a Ph.D.
in biochemistry and endocrinology.

865
01:16:18,366 --> 01:16:20,285
You can call me "Jeff."

866
01:16:22,912 --> 01:16:25,248
Anything else you want to call me,
you'll have to do so in private.

867
01:16:26,666 --> 01:16:28,835
Um, okay.

868
01:16:29,586 --> 01:16:34,048
I find chemistry to be magical.
I find it an adventure.

869
01:16:34,132 --> 01:16:38,303
An exploration into the building blocks
of our physical universe.

870
01:16:38,386 --> 01:16:40,889
So how many of you
have taken chemistry before?

871
01:16:43,850 --> 01:16:46,811
Okay, I've never taught it before,
so we're gonna be fine.

872
01:16:46,895 --> 01:16:49,272
Our first experiment is gonna be

873
01:16:49,355 --> 01:16:51,691
measuring the molecular weight
of butane.

874
01:16:53,985 --> 01:16:56,613
He's on line three.

875
01:16:59,949 --> 01:17:04,287
- Hello?
- Mr. Scruggs? Jeff Wigand.

876
01:17:04,370 --> 01:17:05,830
Lowell Bergman said
I should give you a call.

877
01:17:06,664 --> 01:17:08,708
My co-counsel, Ron Motley and I,

878
01:17:08,791 --> 01:17:10,502
have filed a lawsuit
against the tobacco industry

879
01:17:10,585 --> 01:17:11,794
on behalf of the State of Mississippi

880
01:17:12,378 --> 01:17:14,798
to get the state reimbursed
Medicaid costs

881
01:17:14,881 --> 01:17:17,008
for treatin' people
with smoking-related illness.

882
01:17:18,551 --> 01:17:22,388
If you'd be interested in talkin' to us,
we'd certainly like to talk to you.

883
01:17:25,266 --> 01:17:26,601
When should we do this?

884
01:17:51,084 --> 01:17:52,794
Who the hell are you?
What are you doing in my house?

885
01:17:52,877 --> 01:17:55,421
- It's okay, Jeff. It's okay.
- Mr. Wigand, you need to speak to...

886
01:17:56,506 --> 01:17:58,883
You've got your own security now.

887
01:18:02,428 --> 01:18:04,848
You know, Lowell, I can't afford to.

888
01:18:04,931 --> 01:18:08,309
No, they're volunteered.
A friend owns a large security company.

889
01:18:09,602 --> 01:18:11,938
How're you doing, Mr. Wigand?
I'm John Telafarro.

890
01:18:12,021 --> 01:18:14,857
There'll be three of us on the detail.

891
01:18:14,941 --> 01:18:16,401
I'm going to the store.

892
01:18:16,484 --> 01:18:19,112
Please explain our new houseguests
to your children.

893
01:18:20,738 --> 01:18:24,117
Mrs. Wigand's leaving the house.

894
01:18:28,288 --> 01:18:30,873
I called Richard Scruggs in Mississippi.

895
01:18:31,165 --> 01:18:32,458
I heard.

896
01:18:33,501 --> 01:18:35,795
I'm gonna be a witness for them
in their litigation.

897
01:18:37,380 --> 01:18:39,924
So I'm gonna fly to Pascagoula,
give a deposition.

898
01:18:40,425 --> 01:18:42,385
I know. I'm gonna go there tonight.

899
01:18:45,054 --> 01:18:46,514
WIGAND: You all right?

900
01:18:46,598 --> 01:18:49,142
- Did you have a good day?
- Yes, I did. I had a great day.

901
01:18:49,976 --> 01:18:52,395
- Coffee, Lowell?
- Yeah, all right.

902
01:18:52,478 --> 01:18:54,772
Wanna play that game
we were playing before?

903
01:18:54,856 --> 01:18:57,692
You know, I think you got it up to five.

904
01:18:57,775 --> 01:18:59,986
I was ahead of you, and then you just...

905
01:19:21,841 --> 01:19:24,344
Please don't wash your hands
in the sink.

906
01:19:24,886 --> 01:19:27,430
Where should I wash them?

907
01:19:27,513 --> 01:19:29,599
Use the bathroom.

908
01:19:29,682 --> 01:19:31,768
What's the difference?

909
01:19:31,851 --> 01:19:33,811
That's for food.

910
01:19:47,367 --> 01:19:49,911
Leave it on. Just leave it on! Okay?

911
01:20:47,927 --> 01:20:50,138
I don't think I can do this.

912
01:20:56,269 --> 01:20:58,646
I want to stand by my husband.

913
01:20:58,730 --> 01:21:01,065
I really do, Jeffrey, but...

914
01:21:02,900 --> 01:21:05,278
I don't think I can do this anymore.

915
01:21:08,531 --> 01:21:10,450
I am so sorry.

916
01:21:30,011 --> 01:21:32,847
Can we talk about this when I get back?

917
01:21:38,227 --> 01:21:40,146
Yes, Jeffrey.

918
01:22:36,244 --> 01:22:38,204
TELAFARRO: It's okay.

919
01:22:52,051 --> 01:22:53,719
Jeff!

920
01:22:58,015 --> 01:22:59,934
You've been served.

921
01:23:12,238 --> 01:23:14,949
Now, what this one is,
is a temporary restraining order,

922
01:23:15,032 --> 01:23:18,160
a gag order,
issued by a Kentucky court.

923
01:23:18,244 --> 01:23:20,830
Jeff Wigand, Michael Moore.

924
01:23:21,247 --> 01:23:22,999
Good to meet you, Dr. Wigand.

925
01:23:23,082 --> 01:23:24,917
Mike's our attorney general down here.

926
01:23:25,001 --> 01:23:27,461
I was just explaining to Jeff
they got a Kentucky court

927
01:23:27,545 --> 01:23:30,047
to issue a gag order
to stop his deposition today.

928
01:23:30,131 --> 01:23:32,091
- Right.
- Now,

929
01:23:32,175 --> 01:23:34,844
they tried to get
the Mississippi court to honor it,

930
01:23:34,927 --> 01:23:36,596
but the judge threw it out.

931
01:23:36,679 --> 01:23:41,475
However, for you, there is a more
perilous effect of the gag order.

932
01:23:42,518 --> 01:23:46,147
Dr. Wigand, you do understand
what can happen, don't you?

933
01:23:48,608 --> 01:23:52,111
I'm not free to testify, here.

934
01:23:52,904 --> 01:23:55,531
That's right.
If you violate the Kentucky order,

935
01:23:55,615 --> 01:23:57,867
when you step foot back in Kentucky

936
01:23:57,950 --> 01:24:00,995
they can find you in contempt
and they can incarcerate you.

937
01:24:01,078 --> 01:24:02,997
And you ought to know that.

938
01:24:06,626 --> 01:24:08,878
- Jail.
- Possibly, yes.

939
01:24:08,961 --> 01:24:10,713
That is one
of the possible consequences

940
01:24:10,796 --> 01:24:13,341
of your testifying here today.
That's right.

941
01:24:19,222 --> 01:24:21,599
How does one go to jail?

942
01:24:22,642 --> 01:24:24,518
What does my family do?

943
01:24:26,395 --> 01:24:28,689
Go on welfare?

944
01:24:28,773 --> 01:24:32,068
If my wife has to work,
who's gonna look after the kids?

945
01:24:32,151 --> 01:24:34,820
Put food on the table?
I mean, my children need me.

946
01:24:34,904 --> 01:24:36,906
If I'm not teaching, there's no medical.

947
01:24:36,989 --> 01:24:41,035
No medical, even on co-pay,
that's like, tuition...

948
01:24:41,118 --> 01:24:43,829
Dr. Wigand, listen.

949
01:24:43,913 --> 01:24:46,332
You may not be able to do this thing.

950
01:24:46,415 --> 01:24:49,210
As I understand from Dick,
you're our key witness,

951
01:24:49,835 --> 01:24:52,463
and I hope you don't withdraw.

952
01:24:53,256 --> 01:24:55,758
I guess we'd all understand if you did.

953
01:24:56,425 --> 01:24:58,678
Guys, I gotta go.
I'm gonna be late for court.

954
01:24:58,761 --> 01:25:02,139
I'll see y'all later.
Dr. Wigand, good luck.

955
01:25:11,899 --> 01:25:14,735
I know what you're facing, Jeff.

956
01:25:14,819 --> 01:25:16,779
And I think I know how you're feeling.

957
01:25:18,364 --> 01:25:21,867
In the Navy, I flewA-6's off carriers.

958
01:25:22,702 --> 01:25:26,205
In combat, events have
a duration of seconds.

959
01:25:26,455 --> 01:25:28,624
Sometimes minutes.

960
01:25:28,708 --> 01:25:31,669
But what you're going through
goes on day in, day out,

961
01:25:31,752 --> 01:25:33,879
whether you're ready for it or not.

962
01:25:33,963 --> 01:25:35,756
Week in, week out.

963
01:25:35,840 --> 01:25:38,634
Month after month after month.

964
01:25:38,718 --> 01:25:42,179
Whether you're up
or whether you're down.

965
01:25:42,263 --> 01:25:45,307
You're assaulted psychologically.

966
01:25:45,391 --> 01:25:47,810
You're assaulted financially,

967
01:25:47,893 --> 01:25:51,230
which is its own special kind of violence
because it's directed at your kids.

968
01:25:52,440 --> 01:25:54,650
What school can you afford?

969
01:25:54,734 --> 01:25:57,445
How will that affect their lives?

970
01:25:57,528 --> 01:26:01,407
You're asking yourself,
"Will that limit what they may become?"

971
01:26:02,742 --> 01:26:05,327
You feel your whole family's future
is compromised,

972
01:26:05,411 --> 01:26:07,997
held hostage.

973
01:26:08,080 --> 01:26:10,207
I do know how it is.

974
01:26:25,348 --> 01:26:26,807
You attract a crowd.

975
01:26:26,891 --> 01:26:28,809
Yeah. Great.

976
01:26:30,603 --> 01:26:33,647
I heard about the Kentucky gag order.

977
01:26:37,485 --> 01:26:39,945
I don't know what to do.

978
01:27:42,216 --> 01:27:44,343
Hold on a second.

979
01:27:45,678 --> 01:27:49,723
Would you please ask Mr. Motley if he
expects his witness to appear or not?

980
01:28:17,251 --> 01:28:20,171
I can't seem to find
the criteria to decide.

981
01:28:22,381 --> 01:28:25,551
It's too big a decision to make
without being resolved in my own mind.

982
01:28:27,970 --> 01:28:30,014
Maybe things have changed.

983
01:28:52,077 --> 01:28:54,038
A lot's changed.

984
01:28:59,418 --> 01:29:01,420
You mean since this morning?

985
01:29:03,714 --> 01:29:06,926
No, I mean since whenever.

986
01:29:13,140 --> 01:29:14,683
Fuck it.

987
01:29:15,976 --> 01:29:17,770
Let's go to court.

988
01:29:18,604 --> 01:29:20,481
SCRUGGS: Dr. Wigand
would like to leave now.

989
01:31:45,209 --> 01:31:47,669
Okay, Jeff. I'm gonna sit you down
at that table over there.

990
01:31:47,753 --> 01:31:49,004
I want to start as fast as possible.

991
01:31:49,088 --> 01:31:51,632
I don't want to give them a chance
to get another restraining order. Okay?

992
01:31:52,341 --> 01:31:54,259
- Let's go.
- Good luck, Doc.

993
01:32:02,684 --> 01:32:05,688
Please stand. Raise your right hand.

994
01:32:05,771 --> 01:32:07,731
Do you swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth

995
01:32:07,815 --> 01:32:09,900
and nothing but the truth,
so help you God?

996
01:32:09,983 --> 01:32:12,528
WIGAND: I do.
STENOGRAPHER: You may be seated.

997
01:32:13,821 --> 01:32:16,240
You understand, Dr. Wigand,
you are under oath?

998
01:32:16,323 --> 01:32:20,411
This is a sworn deposition.
There's no judge. It's not a trial.

999
01:32:20,494 --> 01:32:23,664
Will you state your name for the record?

1000
01:32:23,831 --> 01:32:27,126
Jeffrey S. Wigand.
R-E-Y. W-l-G-A-N-D.

1001
01:32:30,754 --> 01:32:33,173
Got any idea what's going on in there?

1002
01:32:33,549 --> 01:32:35,467
No, I don't have a clue.

1003
01:32:37,469 --> 01:32:39,788
- That is correct.
- In other words, it acts as a drug...

1004
01:32:39,872 --> 01:32:42,407
- Object to the form of the question.
- It acts as a drug...

1005
01:32:42,491 --> 01:32:44,368
- Object to the form...
- It acts as a drug...

1006
01:32:44,451 --> 01:32:46,562
- Object!
- Is there an echo in here?

1007
01:32:46,645 --> 01:32:48,480
Your objection's been recorded.

1008
01:32:48,564 --> 01:32:51,733
She typed it into her little machine
over there. It's on the record.

1009
01:32:52,109 --> 01:32:56,071
So now I'll proceed
with my deposition of my witness.

1010
01:32:58,073 --> 01:33:00,117
- Does it act as a drug?
- Dr. Wigand!

1011
01:33:01,410 --> 01:33:03,954
I am instructing you

1012
01:33:04,455 --> 01:33:06,248
not to answer that question.

1013
01:33:06,331 --> 01:33:10,252
In accordance to the terms of
the contractual obligations

1014
01:33:10,335 --> 01:33:12,754
undertaken by you

1015
01:33:12,838 --> 01:33:15,799
not to disclose any information

1016
01:33:15,883 --> 01:33:19,595
about your work at the Brown
& Williamson Tobacco Company,

1017
01:33:19,845 --> 01:33:22,973
and in accordance
with the force and effect

1018
01:33:23,056 --> 01:33:27,436
of the temporary restraining order
that has been entered against you

1019
01:33:27,519 --> 01:33:29,938
by the court in the State of Kentucky.

1020
01:33:31,398 --> 01:33:33,400
That means you don't talk.

1021
01:33:34,735 --> 01:33:36,153
Mr. Motley, we have rights here.

1022
01:33:36,236 --> 01:33:37,821
Oh, you've got rights.

1023
01:33:39,239 --> 01:33:42,284
And lefts. Ups and downs and middles.

1024
01:33:42,367 --> 01:33:47,080
So what? You don't get to instruct
anything around here!

1025
01:33:47,456 --> 01:33:51,752
This is not North Carolina,
not South Carolina, nor Kentucky.

1026
01:33:52,503 --> 01:33:55,130
This is the sovereign State
of Mississippi's proceeding.

1027
01:33:55,214 --> 01:33:56,715
Wipe that smirk off your face!

1028
01:33:57,883 --> 01:34:01,929
Dr. Wigand's deposition
will be part of this record!

1029
01:34:02,012 --> 01:34:03,805
And I'm gonna take
my witness' testimony

1030
01:34:03,889 --> 01:34:06,058
whether the hell you like it or not!

1031
01:34:20,322 --> 01:34:22,115
Answer the question, Doctor.

1032
01:34:22,199 --> 01:34:26,036
Yes. It produces
a physiological response,

1033
01:34:26,119 --> 01:34:27,829
which meets the definition of a drug.

1034
01:34:28,831 --> 01:34:32,751
Nicotine is associated with impact,
satisfaction.

1035
01:34:33,252 --> 01:34:38,131
It has a pharmacological effect that
crosses the blood-brain barrier intact.

1036
01:34:40,759 --> 01:34:43,637
MOTLEY: Thank you, Doctor.
Thank you.

1037
01:35:27,639 --> 01:35:29,891
One of the reasons I'm here is that I felt

1038
01:35:29,975 --> 01:35:33,061
that their representation clearly...

1039
01:35:35,564 --> 01:35:39,651
Run that Sandefur piece
on "nicotine's not addictive."

1040
01:35:39,735 --> 01:35:43,572
Run that on camera, then cut right to
Wigand with "I believe they perjured..."

1041
01:35:43,655 --> 01:35:46,533
Then go wide to the CEOs
all taking the oath.

1042
01:35:46,617 --> 01:35:48,577
Then back on Jeff

1043
01:35:48,660 --> 01:35:51,496
and play the pause after
the word "felt" on the B-side.

1044
01:35:52,331 --> 01:35:55,459
Hell of a show, Mike.
Explosive material.

1045
01:35:57,586 --> 01:36:00,339
- It went great in Mississippi, Mike.
- Good.

1046
01:36:00,881 --> 01:36:03,550
I heard Wigand's deposition got sealed.

1047
01:36:03,634 --> 01:36:06,970
They argued that he was going to reveal
the secret formula of Kools to the world.

1048
01:36:09,514 --> 01:36:11,933
BERGMAN: Sealed doesn't
hurt Scruggs' litigation,

1049
01:36:12,017 --> 01:36:13,935
and since we're the only ones
with the story,

1050
01:36:14,019 --> 01:36:15,646
I believe we're sitting on an exclusive.

1051
01:36:15,729 --> 01:36:16,713
I like that.

1052
01:36:16,715 --> 01:36:18,191
HEWITT: Corporate has
some questions.

1053
01:36:18,193 --> 01:36:20,870
We've got a meeting at Black Rock
first thing in the morning.

1054
01:36:20,917 --> 01:36:24,696
- When's the air date?
- Lowell, Sharon's on line three.

1055
01:36:24,780 --> 01:36:27,532
- Tell her I'll call her back in 10.
- EDITOR: Here we go.

1056
01:36:28,809 --> 01:36:31,528
WALLACE ON TV: That they had long
known that the nicotine in tobacco

1057
01:36:31,611 --> 01:36:35,791
is an addictive drug despite
their public statements to the contrary.

1058
01:36:35,874 --> 01:36:39,628
Like the testimony before Congress
of Dr. Wigand's former boss,

1059
01:36:39,711 --> 01:36:43,674
Brown & Williamson's chief
executive officer, Thomas Sandefur.

1060
01:36:43,757 --> 01:36:46,426
believe that nicotine is not addictive.

1061
01:36:46,510 --> 01:36:48,887
believe Mr. Sandefur perjured himself

1062
01:36:48,970 --> 01:36:50,972
because I watched those testimonies
very carefully.

1063
01:36:51,056 --> 01:36:54,976
WALLACE: All of us did. I mean,
there was this whole line of people,

1064
01:36:55,060 --> 01:36:57,354
whole line of CEOs up there,
all swearing.

1065
01:36:57,437 --> 01:37:00,148
WIGAND: Part of the reason I'm here
is that I felt

1066
01:37:01,274 --> 01:37:03,777
that their representation
clearly misstated

1067
01:37:03,860 --> 01:37:05,946
what is common language
within the company.

1068
01:37:06,029 --> 01:37:08,281
We are in
the nicotine delivery business.

1069
01:37:08,991 --> 01:37:10,701
There is extensive use
of this technology,

1070
01:37:10,784 --> 01:37:11,993
known as ammonia chemistry.

1071
01:37:12,077 --> 01:37:15,997
It allows for the nicotine to be
more rapidly absorbed in the lung

1072
01:37:16,081 --> 01:37:18,542
and therefore affect
the brain and central nervous system.

1073
01:37:18,625 --> 01:37:20,293
WALLACE: That's what
cigarettes are for.

1074
01:37:20,377 --> 01:37:21,545
Delivery device for nicotine.

1075
01:37:21,628 --> 01:37:23,380
WALLACE: A delivery device
for nicotine.

1076
01:37:23,463 --> 01:37:26,633
Put it in your mouth, light it up
and you're going to get your fix.

1077
01:37:26,717 --> 01:37:28,176
You're gonna get your fix.

1078
01:40:33,195 --> 01:40:36,156
- Shall I send for coffee? Sorry I'm late.
- WALLACE: No, we're fine.

1079
01:40:36,239 --> 01:40:37,949
- Are you sure?
- BERGMAN: Yeah.

1080
01:40:39,284 --> 01:40:41,536
All right. I thought we'd get together

1081
01:40:41,620 --> 01:40:43,538
because there's a legal concept

1082
01:40:43,622 --> 01:40:46,082
that has been getting
some new attention recently.

1083
01:40:46,166 --> 01:40:48,460
Tortious interference.

1084
01:40:48,543 --> 01:40:52,339
If two people have an agreement,
like a confidentiality agreement,

1085
01:40:52,422 --> 01:40:56,885
and one of them breaks it because they
are induced to do so by a third party,

1086
01:40:56,968 --> 01:41:00,221
the third party can be sued
for damages for interfering.

1087
01:41:00,305 --> 01:41:02,182
Hence, tortious interference.

1088
01:41:02,265 --> 01:41:05,018
"Interfering"? That's what we do.

1089
01:41:05,235 --> 01:41:08,063
I think what we're trying to tell you
is that it happens all the time.

1090
01:41:08,146 --> 01:41:12,150
This is a news organization. People are
always telling us things they shouldn't.

1091
01:41:12,567 --> 01:41:15,362
We have to verify if it's true
and in the public interest.

1092
01:41:15,445 --> 01:41:16,738
And if it is, we air it.

1093
01:41:16,821 --> 01:41:18,114
And after we corroborate it.

1094
01:41:18,198 --> 01:41:21,117
That's why we've never lost a lawsuit
and run a classy show.

1095
01:41:21,201 --> 01:41:22,244
Anything else?

1096
01:41:22,327 --> 01:41:25,997
And 60 Minutes' verification
is exact and precise.

1097
01:41:26,081 --> 01:41:30,001
And I don't think it would hurt
to make sure you're right on this one.

1098
01:41:30,085 --> 01:41:34,047
Why? You think we have liability?

1099
01:41:34,130 --> 01:41:36,049
What's the CBS News position, Eric?

1100
01:41:36,132 --> 01:41:38,301
There's a possibility. It's rather remote.

1101
01:41:38,593 --> 01:41:41,429
But one we have to check on, Mike.

1102
01:41:41,513 --> 01:41:44,015
I've retained outside counsel
to do exactly that

1103
01:41:44,099 --> 01:41:48,770
on a segment, I might add,
that's already rife with problems.

1104
01:41:48,853 --> 01:41:50,605
What does that mean? "Rife with..."

1105
01:41:50,689 --> 01:41:53,942
I'm told unusual promises
were made to Wigand.

1106
01:41:53,950 --> 01:41:56,611
No, only that we would hold his story
until it was safe for him.

1107
01:41:56,695 --> 01:41:59,781
And I'm told there are questions
as to our star witness' veracity.

1108
01:42:00,240 --> 01:42:03,243
His "veracity" was good enough
for the State of Mississippi.

1109
01:42:03,451 --> 01:42:05,704
Our standards have to be
higher than anyone else's,

1110
01:42:05,787 --> 01:42:08,790
because we are the standard
for everybody else.

1111
01:42:09,582 --> 01:42:13,420
Well, as a "standard," I'll hang with
"is this guy telling the truth?"

1112
01:42:14,504 --> 01:42:18,466
Well, with tortious interference,
I'm afraid, the greater the truth,

1113
01:42:18,550 --> 01:42:20,093
the greater the damage.

1114
01:42:22,178 --> 01:42:23,430
Come again?

1115
01:42:23,513 --> 01:42:27,225
They own the information
he's disclosing.

1116
01:42:27,517 --> 01:42:31,062
The truer it is,
the greater the damage to them.

1117
01:42:31,646 --> 01:42:33,815
If he lied,
he didn't disclose their information,

1118
01:42:33,898 --> 01:42:35,400
and the damages are smaller.

1119
01:42:40,447 --> 01:42:44,409
- Is this Alice in Wonderland?
- You said, "on this one."

1120
01:42:45,201 --> 01:42:47,120
What about this one?

1121
01:42:47,370 --> 01:42:50,832
If this holds up,
and it very well may not, Mike.

1122
01:42:50,915 --> 01:42:54,461
But if it did and we aired this segment,

1123
01:42:54,544 --> 01:42:58,506
and CBS was sued
by Brown & Williamson,

1124
01:42:58,590 --> 01:43:00,759
I think we could be at grave risk.

1125
01:43:00,842 --> 01:43:04,721
- How grave?
- Well, at the end of the day,

1126
01:43:04,804 --> 01:43:07,307
because of your segment,

1127
01:43:07,390 --> 01:43:09,809
the Brown & Williamson
Tobacco Company

1128
01:43:09,893 --> 01:43:11,936
could own CBS.

1129
01:43:15,940 --> 01:43:19,652
Oh. You know, I am sorry,
but I'm due upstairs.

1130
01:43:20,820 --> 01:43:23,782
Is CBS Corporate telling CBS News,

1131
01:43:24,074 --> 01:43:26,534
"Do not go to air with this story"?

1132
01:43:27,452 --> 01:43:30,246
You're getting ahead of yourself.
We're all in this together.

1133
01:43:30,330 --> 01:43:33,416
We're all CBS. We'll find out soon.

1134
01:43:33,500 --> 01:43:35,460
Thank you, gentlemen.

1135
01:43:42,550 --> 01:43:44,511
"Tortious interference."

1136
01:43:44,594 --> 01:43:47,555
That sounds like a disease
caught by a radio.

1137
01:43:47,639 --> 01:43:49,391
- HEWITT: Lunch?
- Sure.

1138
01:43:50,767 --> 01:43:52,644
Don't worry.
We call the shots around here.

1139
01:44:08,034 --> 01:44:09,994
- Hello?
- Debbie, it's me.

1140
01:44:10,078 --> 01:44:11,579
I want you to check some filings,

1141
01:44:11,663 --> 01:44:14,165
and give me John Wilson's number
at Bear Stearns.

1142
01:44:22,173 --> 01:44:24,634
- BERGMAN: What now?
- Kluster's coming over.

1143
01:44:32,475 --> 01:44:34,436
KLUSTER: Hello, Lowell, Mike.

1144
01:44:34,602 --> 01:44:36,688
Don.

1145
01:44:37,147 --> 01:44:41,192
There has been so much
soul searching about this Wigand.

1146
01:44:41,276 --> 01:44:44,279
I've decided we should cut
an alternate version of the show

1147
01:44:44,362 --> 01:44:45,613
without his interview.

1148
01:44:45,697 --> 01:44:50,118
So what happened to Ms. Caperelli's
checking with outside counsel first?

1149
01:44:50,201 --> 01:44:51,936
- All that crap?
- That's happening.

1150
01:44:52,020 --> 01:44:53,913
Hopefully, we won't have to
use the alternate,

1151
01:44:53,997 --> 01:44:55,457
but we should have it in the can.

1152
01:44:55,540 --> 01:44:56,749
I'm not touching my film.

1153
01:44:56,875 --> 01:44:58,309
- I'm afraid you are.
- No, I'm not.

1154
01:44:58,393 --> 01:45:01,145
We're doing this with
or without you, Lowell.

1155
01:45:01,713 --> 01:45:05,550
If you like, I can assign
another producer to edit your show.

1156
01:45:07,760 --> 01:45:13,308
Since when has the paragon
of investigative journalism

1157
01:45:13,391 --> 01:45:17,520
allowed lawyers to determine
the news content on 60 Minutes?

1158
01:45:17,604 --> 01:45:18,980
HEWITT: It's an alternate version.

1159
01:45:20,023 --> 01:45:22,692
So what
if we have an alternate version?

1160
01:45:22,775 --> 01:45:25,403
And I don't think our being cautious
is so damned unreasonable.

1161
01:45:26,696 --> 01:45:28,740
So now, if you will
excuse me, gentlemen,

1162
01:45:28,823 --> 01:45:31,409
Mr. Rather's been complaining
about his chair again.

1163
01:45:31,492 --> 01:45:33,077
Before you go,

1164
01:45:35,747 --> 01:45:37,415
I discovered this.

1165
01:45:39,334 --> 01:45:40,793
SEC filing

1166
01:45:40,877 --> 01:45:44,297
for the sale of CBS Corporation
to Westinghouse Corporation.

1167
01:45:44,380 --> 01:45:46,216
- What?
- Yeah, I heard rumors.

1168
01:45:46,299 --> 01:45:47,509
It's not a rumor. It's a sale.

1169
01:45:47,592 --> 01:45:51,846
If Tisch can unload CBS
for $81 a share to Westinghouse,

1170
01:45:51,930 --> 01:45:53,348
and then is suddenly threatened

1171
01:45:53,431 --> 01:45:57,227
with a multi-billion dollar lawsuit
from Brown & Williamson,

1172
01:45:57,769 --> 01:45:59,687
that could screw up the sale,
could it not?

1173
01:45:59,771 --> 01:46:02,482
- KLUSTER: What are you implying?
- I'm not implying. I'm quoting.

1174
01:46:04,400 --> 01:46:07,528
"More vested interests. Persons who
will profit from this merger.

1175
01:46:07,612 --> 01:46:12,867
"Ms. Helen Caperelli, general counsel
of CBS News, 3.9 million.

1176
01:46:13,076 --> 01:46:16,037
"Mr. Eric Kluster,
President of CBS News,

1177
01:46:16,120 --> 01:46:17,664
"1.4 million."

1178
01:46:19,415 --> 01:46:22,252
Are you suggesting that
she and Eric are influenced by money?

1179
01:46:22,335 --> 01:46:26,381
No, no, of course they're not influenced
by money. They work for free.

1180
01:46:26,464 --> 01:46:28,967
And you are a volunteer
executive producer.

1181
01:46:29,551 --> 01:46:33,012
CBS does not do that. And you're
questioning our journalistic integrity.

1182
01:46:33,096 --> 01:46:34,931
No, I'm questioning your hearing.

1183
01:46:35,014 --> 01:46:37,308
You hear "reasonable"
and "tortious interference."

1184
01:46:37,392 --> 01:46:40,562
I hear "potential Brown & Williamson
lawsuit

1185
01:46:40,645 --> 01:46:43,648
"jeopardizing the sale
of CBS to Westinghouse."

1186
01:46:43,731 --> 01:46:47,110
I hear, "Shut the segment down.
Cut Wigand loose.

1187
01:46:47,193 --> 01:46:49,888
"Obey orders and fuck off."
That's what I hear.

1188
01:46:49,971 --> 01:46:51,489
- HEWITT: You're exaggerating.
- I am?

1189
01:46:51,573 --> 01:46:54,867
You pay me to go get guys like Wigand,

1190
01:46:54,951 --> 01:46:58,746
to draw him out, to get him to trust us,
to get him to go on television.

1191
01:46:58,830 --> 01:47:01,749
I do. I deliver him. He sits. He talks.

1192
01:47:01,833 --> 01:47:05,086
He violates his own fucking
confidentiality agreement.

1193
01:47:05,169 --> 01:47:09,299
And he's only the key witness in
the biggest public health reform issue,

1194
01:47:09,382 --> 01:47:11,467
maybe the biggest, most expensive

1195
01:47:11,551 --> 01:47:14,470
corporate malfeasance case
in US history.

1196
01:47:14,554 --> 01:47:16,889
And Jeffrey Wigand,
who's out on a limb,

1197
01:47:16,973 --> 01:47:19,309
does he go on television
and tell the truth?

1198
01:47:19,392 --> 01:47:21,602
Yes. Is it newsworthy?

1199
01:47:21,686 --> 01:47:24,355
Yes. Are we gonna air it?

1200
01:47:24,439 --> 01:47:26,482
Of course not. Why?

1201
01:47:26,566 --> 01:47:28,943
Because he's not telling the truth? No.

1202
01:47:29,027 --> 01:47:32,739
Because he is telling the truth.
That's why we're not gonna air it.

1203
01:47:32,822 --> 01:47:35,408
And the more truth he tells,
the worse it gets.

1204
01:47:35,491 --> 01:47:38,202
You are a fanatic, an anarchist.
You know that?

1205
01:47:39,120 --> 01:47:42,665
If we can't have a whole show, then
I want half a show rather than no show.

1206
01:47:43,124 --> 01:47:44,192
But, oh, no. Not you.

1207
01:47:44,275 --> 01:47:46,869
You won't be satisfied unless
you're putting the company at risk!

1208
01:47:46,953 --> 01:47:49,964
What are you? Are you a businessman
or are you a newsman?

1209
01:47:50,048 --> 01:47:52,425
Because that happens to be
what Mike and I

1210
01:47:52,508 --> 01:47:55,136
and some other people
around here do for a living.

1211
01:47:55,219 --> 01:47:58,723
Put the corporation at risk?
Give me a fucking break!

1212
01:47:58,806 --> 01:48:01,059
These people are
putting our whole reason

1213
01:48:01,142 --> 01:48:03,061
for doing what we do on the line!

1214
01:48:03,186 --> 01:48:05,229
- Lowell!
- What?

1215
01:48:05,855 --> 01:48:08,066
I'm with Don on this.

1216
01:48:30,838 --> 01:48:32,048
What's wrong?

1217
01:48:32,131 --> 01:48:34,717
They're killing the Wigand interview.

1218
01:48:35,301 --> 01:48:36,469
What?

1219
01:48:36,552 --> 01:48:39,347
They're pretending it's process.
That's bullshit. It's foregone.

1220
01:48:43,017 --> 01:48:44,936
What are you and Mike gonna do?

1221
01:48:47,688 --> 01:48:49,732
I'm alone on this.

1222
01:48:51,275 --> 01:48:53,027
- Oh, baby.
- Yeah.

1223
01:49:23,099 --> 01:49:25,017
It's Jeffrey Wigand.

1224
01:49:34,527 --> 01:49:37,989
Jeffrey. How are you?

1225
01:49:38,072 --> 01:49:39,824
How's the family? Okay?

1226
01:49:40,408 --> 01:49:41,517
There is no family.

1227
01:49:41,601 --> 01:49:43,202
What do you mean,
"there is no family"?

1228
01:49:43,828 --> 01:49:45,830
Liane has filed for divorce.

1229
01:49:46,289 --> 01:49:49,125
And, so, I've moved out.

1230
01:49:49,208 --> 01:49:51,586
see the girls a couple of days a week.

1231
01:49:51,669 --> 01:49:55,256
- Where are you staying now?
- Our favorite hotel, honey.

1232
01:49:57,175 --> 01:49:59,343
I checked into room 930.

1233
01:50:01,512 --> 01:50:03,431
Odd choice, huh?

1234
01:50:07,018 --> 01:50:09,520
I don't know how to say this,

1235
01:50:09,604 --> 01:50:11,647
Jeff, except to just say it right out.

1236
01:50:11,731 --> 01:50:15,735
So, I'll say it. They do not want to air it.

1237
01:50:18,029 --> 01:50:19,489
What?

1238
01:50:19,572 --> 01:50:22,867
B&Wmay have threatened litigation.

1239
01:50:22,950 --> 01:50:25,369
CBS is on the block.

1240
01:50:25,828 --> 01:50:29,040
- But you, I mean, I know how you...
- No.

1241
01:50:29,874 --> 01:50:31,375
"No," what?

1242
01:50:32,084 --> 01:50:36,881
I do not think that you know for me
what it is to walk in my shoes.

1243
01:50:38,716 --> 01:50:40,676
For my kids to have seen it,

1244
01:50:42,053 --> 01:50:44,639
for them to know why I've
put them through what I did.

1245
01:50:45,556 --> 01:50:48,309
The public airing of that,
the testament to why I did what I did.

1246
01:50:48,392 --> 01:50:51,395
You're telling me it's not
gonna see the light of day?

1247
01:50:52,063 --> 01:50:53,272
Jeff.

1248
01:51:37,275 --> 01:51:39,193
Mrs. Wigand?

1249
01:51:40,611 --> 01:51:43,531
It hasn't been Mrs. Wigand
for some time.

1250
01:51:43,614 --> 01:51:44,865
I'm an investigator,

1251
01:51:44,949 --> 01:51:47,952
and I was wondering if I could ask you
a couple of questions about that.

1252
01:51:50,371 --> 01:51:52,290
All right.

1253
01:51:56,836 --> 01:51:59,046
Seven months after we were married,

1254
01:51:59,130 --> 01:52:01,465
we found out
that I had multiple sclerosis.

1255
01:52:01,549 --> 01:52:03,384
MAN: And you had a daughter, Diane...

1256
01:52:03,467 --> 01:52:05,386
MAN 2: Tommy Sandefur
told me himself.

1257
01:52:05,469 --> 01:52:08,139
He's not going to allow Brown
& Williamson to be demonized

1258
01:52:08,222 --> 01:52:10,057
to the American public.

1259
01:52:10,141 --> 01:52:12,694
So I told Peter Jennings. And I...
Hold on.

1260
01:52:12,777 --> 01:52:14,395
MAN ON TV: You had
multiple sclerosis.

1261
01:52:14,478 --> 01:52:16,647
You had a small child to raise.

1262
01:52:17,148 --> 01:52:20,735
Mention that part in the executive
summary and in the chapters.

1263
01:52:20,818 --> 01:52:23,195
First wife
and estrangement of daughter.

1264
01:52:23,579 --> 01:52:26,248
So I was telling Pete, I said,
"You've been taken in by this guy."

1265
01:52:26,332 --> 01:52:29,126
The divorce was something
that we both wanted.

1266
01:52:29,744 --> 01:52:31,495
He's a shoplifter.

1267
01:52:32,538 --> 01:52:34,332
He's a convicted shoplifter.

1268
01:52:52,558 --> 01:52:55,895
So, what are you gonna do?

1269
01:52:56,771 --> 01:52:59,357
What do you think I'm gonna do?
Quit in protest?

1270
01:53:00,024 --> 01:53:01,442
I'm not gonna do that.

1271
01:53:02,485 --> 01:53:03,944
You're taking "no" for an answer?

1272
01:53:04,779 --> 01:53:07,448
No, I'm not gonna take
"no" for an answer. No.

1273
01:53:07,531 --> 01:53:10,117
You're not? What are you doing?

1274
01:53:10,201 --> 01:53:14,163
I'm staying right here, doing my job.
Fighting to get my show on the air.

1275
01:53:14,246 --> 01:53:16,374
You don't like it? Hey, I tell you what?

1276
01:53:16,457 --> 01:53:18,042
Fire my ass.

1277
01:53:19,919 --> 01:53:23,714
End up in a high-profile lawsuit with
Lowell, the First Amendment martyr?

1278
01:53:27,134 --> 01:53:29,470
I don't think so. Take a look at this.

1279
01:53:30,888 --> 01:53:33,724
This is a summary of a dossier
that's being prepared.

1280
01:53:34,392 --> 01:53:36,102
He wouldn't lie about his whole life.

1281
01:53:36,185 --> 01:53:38,312
Who's gonna believe him
about anything he says?

1282
01:53:38,396 --> 01:53:42,233
The Wall Street Journal is doing
a major story, and, I think, The Post.

1283
01:53:43,442 --> 01:53:46,112
You backed the wrong horse.

1284
01:53:46,195 --> 01:53:49,323
The version without the interview
is gonna air the week after next.

1285
01:53:56,580 --> 01:53:57,915
What was that about?

1286
01:53:59,291 --> 01:54:01,794
- Get me Wigand.
- Sure.

1287
01:54:05,131 --> 01:54:08,175
What the fuck is this? Fuck!

1288
01:54:08,259 --> 01:54:10,511
BERGMAN: You never told me
you were married before.

1289
01:54:10,594 --> 01:54:13,723
- That you had a daughter.
- How is that any of your business?

1290
01:54:13,806 --> 01:54:16,100
That is not something
that you people need to know.

1291
01:54:16,183 --> 01:54:18,169
Oh, you know what we do
or do not need to know?

1292
01:54:18,171 --> 01:54:19,881
Since when have you become
a media expert?

1293
01:54:19,946 --> 01:54:21,939
What do you wanna do, Lowell?
Look up my ass, too?

1294
01:54:22,022 --> 01:54:23,257
Oh, for God's sake.

1295
01:54:23,259 --> 01:54:25,235
You're not even on this anymore.
What do you care?

1296
01:54:25,237 --> 01:54:26,430
Jeff, wake the fuck up!

1297
01:54:26,432 --> 01:54:29,919
Everybody is on the line here.
If they catch you in a lie,

1298
01:54:29,947 --> 01:54:32,575
they can paint everything
with that brush, you understand?

1299
01:54:32,658 --> 01:54:35,077
- Everything you say.
- I told the truth.

1300
01:54:35,161 --> 01:54:38,706
Everything you say.
And I can't defend you, man,

1301
01:54:38,789 --> 01:54:40,750
with one hand tied behind my back

1302
01:54:40,833 --> 01:54:43,419
because you keep from me
what they can discover.

1303
01:54:43,502 --> 01:54:46,213
And they will discover everything.
Believe me.

1304
01:54:46,297 --> 01:54:48,466
I was young! I was young!

1305
01:54:48,549 --> 01:54:51,135
Confused.
We didn't handle it the right way.

1306
01:54:51,218 --> 01:54:53,220
She sued you for back payments
of child support?

1307
01:54:53,304 --> 01:54:54,555
She did not sue me.

1308
01:54:54,638 --> 01:54:58,267
We had a dispute over money.
I settled it. She dropped the complaint.

1309
01:54:59,602 --> 01:55:00,728
Any other questions?

1310
01:55:00,811 --> 01:55:03,230
Yes. Did you lie about
being on the American judo team

1311
01:55:03,314 --> 01:55:04,315
in the Olympics?

1312
01:55:04,732 --> 01:55:06,926
- What?
- Some public relations guy

1313
01:55:07,009 --> 01:55:09,211
got hold of a tape of an interview
where you're saying

1314
01:55:09,295 --> 01:55:11,739
you were on the American
judo team in the Olympics.

1315
01:55:11,822 --> 01:55:13,824
What kind of shit is this?

1316
01:55:14,992 --> 01:55:19,080
I was not on the team.
I sparred with the Olympic team. Okay?

1317
01:55:19,163 --> 01:55:22,166
All right. ABC Telemarketing Company?

1318
01:55:22,500 --> 01:55:25,294
- ABC...
- ABC Telemarketing Company.

1319
01:55:25,377 --> 01:55:28,422
The can opener! A 39.95 can opener!

1320
01:55:28,506 --> 01:55:30,341
I canceled payment. It was junk!

1321
01:55:31,050 --> 01:55:34,220
You ever bounce a check, Lowell?
You ever look at another woman's tits?

1322
01:55:34,345 --> 01:55:36,680
You ever cheat a little on your taxes?

1323
01:55:36,764 --> 01:55:39,767
Whose life, if you look at it under
a microscope, doesn't have any flaws?

1324
01:55:39,850 --> 01:55:42,978
Well, that's the whole point, Jeffrey.
That's the whole point.

1325
01:55:43,062 --> 01:55:46,941
Anyone's, everyone's.
They are gonna look under every rock,

1326
01:55:47,024 --> 01:55:50,736
dig up every flaw,
every mistake you've ever made.

1327
01:55:50,820 --> 01:55:53,197
They are going to distort
and exaggerate

1328
01:55:53,280 --> 01:55:55,783
everything you've ever done, man.
Don't you understand?

1329
01:55:55,866 --> 01:55:57,743
What does this have to do
with my testimony?

1330
01:55:57,827 --> 01:55:59,620
What does it have to do
with my testimony?

1331
01:55:59,703 --> 01:56:02,523
- I told the truth! It's true and provable!
- It's not about...

1332
01:56:02,606 --> 01:56:05,175
That's not the fucking point,
whether you told the truth or not!

1333
01:56:07,586 --> 01:56:08,921
Hello?

1334
01:56:12,466 --> 01:56:14,218
I told the truth.

1335
01:56:16,804 --> 01:56:18,430
told the truth.

1336
01:56:20,891 --> 01:56:23,060
I gotta teach class. I gotta go.
I gotta teach class.

1337
01:56:23,561 --> 01:56:26,355
And I gotta refute
every fucking accusation made

1338
01:56:26,438 --> 01:56:29,400
in this report before
The Wall Street Journal runs.

1339
01:56:33,112 --> 01:56:35,072
I am trying to protect you, man.

1340
01:56:35,906 --> 01:56:37,867
I hope you improve
your batting average.

1341
01:56:57,678 --> 01:57:01,015
WOMAN: They're cutting the interest
rate, and I have that great feature...

1342
01:57:07,146 --> 01:57:09,106
- Hello?
- It's Lowell.

1343
01:57:09,607 --> 01:57:13,819
Are you guys planning to do a piece on
a former top executive in Big Tobacco?

1344
01:57:13,944 --> 01:57:16,780
- You caught me in a news meeting.
- Are you or are you not, Charlie?

1345
01:57:17,072 --> 01:57:18,908
You bet we are,
and I can't talk to you now.

1346
01:57:18,991 --> 01:57:21,744
- We gotta hook up.
- Sure. Where?

1347
01:57:21,827 --> 01:57:23,787
- PJ'S.
- I'll be there.

1348
01:57:31,879 --> 01:57:34,506
Yeah, I got it. 500 pages of it.

1349
01:57:34,590 --> 01:57:36,717
They looked in every corner
of this guy's life,

1350
01:57:36,800 --> 01:57:38,218
from the spousal abuse charge,

1351
01:57:38,302 --> 01:57:41,972
to shoplifting, to a traffic ticket
he got once for running a red light.

1352
01:57:42,056 --> 01:57:45,559
It's Terry Lenzner's outfit, IGI.
Jack, listen to me.

1353
01:57:45,643 --> 01:57:48,062
Their strategy: discredit this guy,

1354
01:57:48,145 --> 01:57:50,231
ruin his reputation
in The Wall Street Journal,

1355
01:57:50,314 --> 01:57:53,734
and then nobody will ever listen
to what he's got to say about tobacco.

1356
01:57:54,276 --> 01:57:56,904
He's dead unless I can
get this thing knocked down.

1357
01:57:56,987 --> 01:57:59,448
Make it even a little more attractive.

1358
01:57:59,531 --> 01:58:02,076
I don't know
if you're ever gonna get paid.

1359
01:58:02,159 --> 01:58:04,745
- Is there any truth to any of it?
- That's a good question.

1360
01:58:04,828 --> 01:58:07,122
"Is there any truth to any of it?"
I doubt it.

1361
01:58:07,206 --> 01:58:09,750
- What's the deadline?
- Soon.

1362
01:58:14,755 --> 01:58:16,799
- Fax me the summary.
- That's great, Jack.

1363
01:58:24,682 --> 01:58:27,726
- Hey. How are you? Hey, listen.
- Hey.

1364
01:58:27,810 --> 01:58:31,105
I hear you guys are sitting
on something sensational over there.

1365
01:58:31,397 --> 01:58:34,900
- Really? Hi, June.
- Oh, hi, baby.

1366
01:58:36,694 --> 01:58:38,821
- Catch you later.
- Okay. Take care.

1367
01:58:41,031 --> 01:58:42,574
- When's your deadline?
- Monday.

1368
01:58:42,658 --> 01:58:44,952
- Push it.
- What? Forget it.

1369
01:58:45,035 --> 01:58:47,079
It's a smear campaign, Charlie.

1370
01:58:47,162 --> 01:58:48,956
It's drawn from a selectively circulated...

1371
01:58:49,039 --> 01:58:50,582
Oh, yeah. Real selective.

1372
01:58:50,608 --> 01:58:52,993
About as hard to get a hold of
as the Manhattan phone book.

1373
01:58:53,076 --> 01:58:57,006
Well, it's authoritative
and overwhelmingly documented.

1374
01:58:57,089 --> 01:58:59,717
And it's bullshit. And if I'm right,
are you gonna put

1375
01:58:59,800 --> 01:59:03,345
The Journal's reputation behind a story
that's gonna blow up in your face?

1376
01:59:03,429 --> 01:59:04,930
I'll take a look at what you got,

1377
01:59:05,014 --> 01:59:07,349
but I'm not moving any deadlines
because you say so.

1378
01:59:15,065 --> 01:59:16,483
Are you all right?

1379
01:59:18,736 --> 01:59:19,903
Yeah.

1380
01:59:29,705 --> 01:59:31,415
WOMAN: Officer Muravchick?

1381
01:59:32,332 --> 01:59:33,834
Thank you.

1382
01:59:35,461 --> 01:59:37,713
Officer Muravchick, how are you?

1383
01:59:37,796 --> 01:59:40,049
- I'm Sandra Sutherland.
- How do you do?

1384
01:59:40,132 --> 01:59:42,217
Fine, thank you.
I'm doing a background check.

1385
01:59:42,301 --> 01:59:44,261
Mind if I sit down?

1386
01:59:46,388 --> 01:59:48,974
Your Honor,
could I have a word with you?

1387
01:59:50,392 --> 01:59:54,146
You presided in a dispute
over support payments.

1388
01:59:54,229 --> 01:59:57,524
Jeffrey Wigand? Yeah, I cited him.

1389
01:59:57,608 --> 02:00:01,570
CBS is under criticism because
the CBS news program, 60 Minutes,

1390
02:00:01,653 --> 02:00:03,530
will not be presenting an interview...

1391
02:00:03,614 --> 02:00:05,616
What the hell are you doing?

1392
02:00:06,658 --> 02:00:08,869
What does it look like I'm doing?
I'm editing.

1393
02:00:08,952 --> 02:00:11,705
No, no, no that. I'm talking
about the Associated Press.

1394
02:00:12,122 --> 02:00:15,918
They got the story that we pulled this
interview, and they talked to Mike and I.

1395
02:00:16,543 --> 02:00:18,212
Did you tell them that we were lying?

1396
02:00:18,295 --> 02:00:19,880
No! I should have.

1397
02:00:19,963 --> 02:00:22,674
I told them I disagreed with you,
Mike and Kluster

1398
02:00:22,758 --> 02:00:25,052
that this segment
is as good as the original.

1399
02:00:25,135 --> 02:00:28,013
I'm not lying for you.
I'm not gonna shut up for you.

1400
02:00:28,097 --> 02:00:30,849
- Not on any of it.
- Hey, I'm not gonna fire you.

1401
02:00:30,933 --> 02:00:33,435
Okay? Take a vacation. Now!

1402
02:00:37,815 --> 02:00:40,651
Lowell? Look, I've decided
to preface Sunday's show.

1403
02:00:40,734 --> 02:00:43,862
I did three minutes on The Evening
News. You'll want to see it.

1404
02:00:44,696 --> 02:00:47,741
- Where are you going?
- I've been banished...

1405
02:00:47,825 --> 02:00:49,451
In lieu of being fired.

1406
02:00:50,619 --> 02:00:53,330
I took off on Tisch.
I took off on Corporate.

1407
02:00:53,414 --> 02:00:56,041
They'll know they're not going to see
everything on Sunday night.

1408
02:00:57,334 --> 02:01:00,003
I don't know. How does that
get Wigand on the air?

1409
02:01:01,004 --> 02:01:02,923
Do me a favor, will you? Spare me.

1410
02:01:03,006 --> 02:01:05,425
For God's sake, get in the real world.
What do you think?

1411
02:01:05,509 --> 02:01:08,762
I'm going to resign in protest
to force it on the air?

1412
02:01:08,846 --> 02:01:12,099
The answer's no. I don't plan
to spend the end of my days

1413
02:01:12,182 --> 02:01:15,060
wandering in the wilderness
of National Public Radio.

1414
02:01:15,144 --> 02:01:17,062
That decision I've already made.

1415
02:01:19,314 --> 02:01:21,692
WOMAN ON TV: This Sunday,
Wallace will broadcast a report

1416
02:01:21,775 --> 02:01:23,110
on the tobacco industry,

1417
02:01:23,193 --> 02:01:26,029
including the tough tactics
tobacco companies employ

1418
02:01:26,113 --> 02:01:28,782
to keep a lid on information
that might be damaging.

1419
02:01:28,866 --> 02:01:31,785
Is there information
that people should have

1420
02:01:31,869 --> 02:01:33,203
that they're not going to have

1421
02:01:33,287 --> 02:01:35,956
because you're not going to
broadcast this interview?

1422
02:01:36,039 --> 02:01:37,499
Yes.

1423
02:01:37,583 --> 02:01:40,377
Today, CBS News president
Eric Kluster

1424
02:01:40,461 --> 02:01:43,130
defended the network's decision
not to broadcast

1425
02:01:43,213 --> 02:01:45,757
key portions
of the controversial interview.

1426
02:01:45,841 --> 02:01:49,136
Mr. Klustersaid, quote,
"The atmosphere is tougher than ever."

1427
02:01:49,219 --> 02:01:51,430
- Where's the rest?
- WOMAN ON TV: Dan.

1428
02:01:51,513 --> 02:01:53,023
Where the hell's the rest?

1429
02:01:53,107 --> 02:01:55,209
DAN: Nebraska football fans
voiced their criticism...

1430
02:01:55,392 --> 02:01:56,727
You cut it!

1431
02:01:56,810 --> 02:01:58,770
Coming up in
Bernard Goldberg's America.

1432
02:01:58,854 --> 02:02:01,815
- You cut the guts out of what I said!
- It was a time consideration...

1433
02:02:01,899 --> 02:02:05,360
Time? Bullshit! You corporate lackey.

1434
02:02:05,444 --> 02:02:07,321
Who told you
your incompetent little fingers

1435
02:02:07,404 --> 02:02:09,364
have the requisite skills to edit me?

1436
02:02:09,448 --> 02:02:12,159
I'm trying to Band-Aid a situation
here, and you're too dim...

1437
02:02:12,242 --> 02:02:14,536
Mike. Mike. Mike.

1438
02:02:14,620 --> 02:02:17,247
"Mike"? "Mike"!

1439
02:02:18,707 --> 02:02:20,500
Try "Mr. Wallace."

1440
02:02:21,084 --> 02:02:22,502
We work in the same corporation,

1441
02:02:22,586 --> 02:02:24,488
doesn't mean we work
in the same profession.

1442
02:02:24,571 --> 02:02:27,132
Now, now what are you going to do
now? You going to finesse me?

1443
02:02:27,216 --> 02:02:31,553
Lawyer me some more? I've been
in this profession 50 fucking years!

1444
02:02:31,637 --> 02:02:34,806
You and the people you work for
are destroying the most respected,

1445
02:02:34,890 --> 02:02:37,601
the highest rated, the most
profitable show on this network.

1446
02:02:53,617 --> 02:02:57,371
Here. These are their leads,
their sources.

1447
02:02:57,454 --> 02:03:00,499
- I want you to have your reporters...
- Suein Hwang and Milo Geyelin.

1448
02:03:00,582 --> 02:03:02,509
Have them make their own calls.

1449
02:03:02,593 --> 02:03:04,728
They'll find that these sources
have a different story

1450
02:03:04,811 --> 02:03:06,438
than the one that's in the dossier.

1451
02:03:08,632 --> 02:03:10,551
Push the deadline, Charlie.

1452
02:03:15,806 --> 02:03:19,476
I'll push it for a week.
I want Milo and Suein to go through it.

1453
02:03:34,658 --> 02:03:36,702
What do you want to buy him for a gift?

1454
02:03:36,952 --> 02:03:40,622
Mmm, he's into kind of little cars that...

1455
02:03:40,956 --> 02:03:42,916
- That remote control thing?
- Yeah.

1456
02:03:43,000 --> 02:03:45,252
All right. We'll go do that tomorrow.

1457
02:03:45,335 --> 02:03:49,464
MAN ON TV: The 63-36 vote was three
shy of the two-thirds needed to pass...

1458
02:03:49,548 --> 02:03:52,426
- Mom. There's Dad.
- Yes?

1459
02:03:52,509 --> 02:03:55,512
- On the TV.
- ...dating back to 1986.

1460
02:03:55,596 --> 02:03:57,764
The most recent trouble
for Wigand occurred here...

1461
02:03:57,848 --> 02:03:59,933
And in local news, WLKO, Louisville,

1462
02:04:00,017 --> 02:04:02,769
has gained access
to a 500-page dossier

1463
02:04:02,853 --> 02:04:05,564
on former Brown & Williamson
research head, Jeffrey Wigand,

1464
02:04:05,647 --> 02:04:09,318
detailing charges of shoplifting
and failing to pay child support.

1465
02:04:09,401 --> 02:04:11,403
Wigand is currently teaching
chemistry and Japanese

1466
02:04:11,486 --> 02:04:13,322
at the duPont Manual High School.

1467
02:04:13,405 --> 02:04:14,906
Maria.

1468
02:04:36,887 --> 02:04:39,431
WALLACE: Thousands of documents
from inside the tobacco industry

1469
02:04:39,514 --> 02:04:41,475
have surfaced over the past year.

1470
02:04:41,558 --> 02:04:43,560
Documents that appear to confirm

1471
02:04:43,643 --> 02:04:45,687
what a former US surgeon general

1472
02:04:45,771 --> 02:04:49,524
and the current head of the Food and
Drug Administration have been saying.

1473
02:04:50,150 --> 02:04:52,486
We learned of a tobacco insider
who could tell us

1474
02:04:52,569 --> 02:04:55,989
whether or not the tobacco industry
has been leveling with the public.

1475
02:04:56,073 --> 02:04:58,158
That insider was formerly

1476
02:04:58,241 --> 02:05:01,370
a highly-placed executive
with a tobacco company.

1477
02:05:01,453 --> 02:05:05,165
But we cannot broadcast what critical
information about tobacco,

1478
02:05:05,248 --> 02:05:08,668
addiction and public health
he might be able to offer.

1479
02:05:08,752 --> 02:05:12,589
Why? Because he had to sign
a confidentiality agreement

1480
02:05:12,672 --> 02:05:14,883
with the tobacco company
he worked for.

1481
02:05:14,966 --> 02:05:18,387
The management of CBS has told us

1482
02:05:18,470 --> 02:05:20,555
that knowing he had that agreement,

1483
02:05:20,639 --> 02:05:23,100
if we were to broadcast
an interview with him,

1484
02:05:23,183 --> 02:05:27,145
CBS could be faced
with a multi-billion dollar lawsuit.

1485
02:05:27,229 --> 02:05:30,899
The fact is, we are not allowed
even to mention his name

1486
02:05:30,982 --> 02:05:33,527
or the name of the company
he worked for.

1487
02:05:33,610 --> 02:05:37,948
And, of course,
we cannot show you his face.

1488
02:05:38,031 --> 02:05:40,033
And your confidentiality
agreement with...

1489
02:05:41,184 --> 02:05:43,136
- ...is still in force?
- VOICE OVER: Yes, it is.

1490
02:05:43,787 --> 02:05:47,207
So what are they gonna do?
Sue you for making this appearance?

1491
02:05:47,290 --> 02:05:49,376
VOICE OVER: I would bet on it.

1492
02:05:49,459 --> 02:05:52,212
WALLACE: The former executive
has reason to bet on being sued,

1493
02:05:52,295 --> 02:05:54,131
for major cigarette manufacturers...

1494
02:06:15,819 --> 02:06:17,654
Yeah.

1495
02:06:17,738 --> 02:06:19,906
WALLACE: You disappeared on me.

1496
02:06:19,990 --> 02:06:22,492
- How long you staying?
- I disappeared on you?

1497
02:06:23,660 --> 02:06:25,704
All right. What did you think?

1498
02:06:27,038 --> 02:06:29,166
I think it was a disgrace.

1499
02:06:53,273 --> 02:06:57,027
- MAN: Still no answer.
- Get me the manager's office.

1500
02:06:58,028 --> 02:07:00,322
David. David, you've got a call
on line four.

1501
02:07:00,405 --> 02:07:02,324
I think you better take it.

1502
02:07:03,750 --> 02:07:05,494
This is David McDougal.
How can I help you?

1503
02:07:05,577 --> 02:07:07,954
Mr. McDougal,
my name is Lowell Bergman.

1504
02:07:08,038 --> 02:07:09,706
I'm a producer for 60 Minutes.

1505
02:07:10,165 --> 02:07:14,085
I'm concerned for a friend of mine
who's staying at your hotel right now.

1506
02:07:21,551 --> 02:07:22,969
Mr. Wigand?

1507
02:07:24,846 --> 02:07:26,139
Mr. Wigand?

1508
02:07:31,937 --> 02:07:34,314
I think I need to call the police.
He won't respond.

1509
02:07:34,397 --> 02:07:37,442
No, no, don't call the police.
Just tell him I'm on the phone with you.

1510
02:07:37,526 --> 02:07:39,986
My name is Lowell Bergman.
Just tell him that.

1511
02:07:40,278 --> 02:07:44,157
Mr. Wigand, Mr. Bergman
is on the telephone.

1512
02:07:45,784 --> 02:07:47,327
Did he hear you?

1513
02:07:47,410 --> 02:07:49,746
You're breaking up. I can't hear you.

1514
02:07:50,247 --> 02:07:51,832
What about now?

1515
02:07:51,915 --> 02:07:54,459
- What?
- Hello? Can you hear me now?

1516
02:09:02,611 --> 02:09:06,323
- What's happening?
- He doesn't seem to be listening.

1517
02:09:06,406 --> 02:09:09,659
All right. Now listen to me.
I want you to tell him,

1518
02:09:09,743 --> 02:09:12,746
in these words,
"Get on the fucking phone."

1519
02:09:13,622 --> 02:09:15,165
I can't say that.

1520
02:09:15,248 --> 02:09:17,792
No, you can. Tell him
to get on the fucking phone!

1521
02:09:18,168 --> 02:09:21,004
He told me to tell you
to get on the fucking phone!

1522
02:09:27,385 --> 02:09:29,846
You manipulated me into this.

1523
02:09:29,930 --> 02:09:32,057
- That's bullshit, Jeff.
- You greased the rails.

1524
02:09:32,140 --> 02:09:36,436
I greased the rails for a guy who wanted
to say "yes." I helped him to say "yes."

1525
02:09:36,519 --> 02:09:38,813
That's all. You're not a robot, Jeff.

1526
02:09:38,897 --> 02:09:40,899
All right? You got a mind
of your own, don't you?

1527
02:09:40,982 --> 02:09:41,941
"Up to you, Jeffrey

1528
02:09:42,025 --> 02:09:44,110
"That's the power you have, Jeffrey.

1529
02:09:44,194 --> 02:09:46,780
"Vital inside information
the American public need to know."

1530
02:09:46,863 --> 02:09:50,325
Lowell Bergman, the hotshot who never
met a source he couldn't turn around.

1531
02:09:50,408 --> 02:09:52,661
I fought for you, and I still fight for you!

1532
02:09:52,744 --> 02:09:55,580
You fought for me?
You manipulated me

1533
02:09:55,664 --> 02:09:58,958
into where I am now, staring
at the Brown & Williamson building!

1534
02:09:59,042 --> 02:10:01,836
It's all dark except the tenth floor.
That's the legal department.

1535
02:10:01,920 --> 02:10:04,047
That's where they fuck with my life.

1536
02:10:08,994 --> 02:10:10,470
Jeffrey, where you going with this?

1537
02:10:12,973 --> 02:10:14,557
So, where you going?

1538
02:10:19,270 --> 02:10:24,025
You are important
to a lot of people, Jeffrey.

1539
02:10:25,193 --> 02:10:26,820
You think about that.

1540
02:10:28,029 --> 02:10:29,948
You think about them.

1541
02:10:43,294 --> 02:10:45,380
I'm running out of heroes, man.

1542
02:10:46,798 --> 02:10:48,925
Guys like you are in short supply.

1543
02:10:54,973 --> 02:10:56,933
Yeah, guys like you, too.

1544
02:11:02,355 --> 02:11:04,441
Where are you, anyway?

1545
02:11:04,524 --> 02:11:07,444
I'm on a leave of absence.
Forced vacation.

1546
02:11:10,655 --> 02:11:12,991
- You try and have a good time.
- Yeah.

1547
02:11:13,825 --> 02:11:15,702
Yeah, I will.

1548
02:11:30,675 --> 02:11:32,452
I'm Lowell Bergman.
I'm from 60 Minutes.

1549
02:11:32,535 --> 02:11:34,779
You know, you take the 60 Minutes
out of that sentence,

1550
02:11:34,863 --> 02:11:36,698
nobody returns your phone calls.

1551
02:11:37,307 --> 02:11:40,310
Maybe Wigand's right.
Maybe I'm hooked.

1552
02:11:42,395 --> 02:11:44,230
What am I hooked on?

1553
02:11:44,314 --> 02:11:46,608
The rush of 60 Minutes?

1554
02:11:47,442 --> 02:11:50,737
What the hell for? "Infotainment"!

1555
02:11:50,820 --> 02:11:52,947
It's so fucking useless, all of it.

1556
02:11:53,031 --> 02:11:56,618
So it's a big country with a free press.
You can go and work somewhere else.

1557
02:11:56,701 --> 02:11:58,953
"Free press"? The press is free.

1558
02:11:59,037 --> 02:12:02,624
For anyone who owns one.
Larry Tisch has a free press.

1559
02:12:02,707 --> 02:12:05,001
- Get some perspective, Lowell.
- I got perspective.

1560
02:12:05,084 --> 02:12:07,086
No, you do not.

1561
02:12:08,505 --> 02:12:10,965
From my perspective,

1562
02:12:11,049 --> 02:12:14,761
what's been going on and
what I've been doing is ridiculous.

1563
02:12:14,844 --> 02:12:17,222
- It's half-measures.
- You're not listening.

1564
02:12:23,561 --> 02:12:26,564
Really know what you're going to do
before you do it.

1565
02:13:08,398 --> 02:13:10,483
DEBBIE: I've got Richard Scruggs
on the phone.

1566
02:13:10,567 --> 02:13:12,402
Patch him through.

1567
02:13:13,611 --> 02:13:15,738
SCRUGGS: Well, Lowell,
you are not gonna believe this.

1568
02:13:16,614 --> 02:13:20,743
The governor of Mississippi
is suing his own attorney general

1569
02:13:20,827 --> 02:13:23,496
to abandon litigation
against Big Tobacco.

1570
02:13:24,664 --> 02:13:26,332
Oh, good.

1571
02:13:26,416 --> 02:13:29,335
But now that the version
without Jeff ran,

1572
02:13:29,419 --> 02:13:31,838
what's the chance of getting
his interview on the air?

1573
02:13:34,340 --> 02:13:36,342
- Hello?
- Yeah, I'm here.

1574
02:13:36,426 --> 02:13:38,928
What chance is there of getting
Jeff's interview on the air?

1575
02:13:39,012 --> 02:13:40,597
Less than great.

1576
02:13:45,435 --> 02:13:47,186
I'd be lying to you if I did not tell you

1577
02:13:47,270 --> 02:13:50,023
how important it was
in the court of public opinion.

1578
02:13:51,316 --> 02:13:53,985
I'd be lying to you if I didn't tell you...

1579
02:13:54,068 --> 02:13:55,862
I'm about out of moves, Dick.

1580
02:13:59,949 --> 02:14:01,618
All right. See ya.

1581
02:14:25,099 --> 02:14:26,517
Hi.

1582
02:14:28,603 --> 02:14:32,482
So, what are you folks doing
here in Lincoln?

1583
02:14:33,942 --> 02:14:36,986
- Geology survey.
- Geology?

1584
02:14:38,029 --> 02:14:40,490
Yeah? Really?

1585
02:14:41,157 --> 02:14:43,117
How about you?

1586
02:14:44,827 --> 02:14:46,371
I work for CBS News.

1587
02:14:47,997 --> 02:14:49,332
Oh, yeah?

1588
02:15:17,068 --> 02:15:19,445
Just ran into two of your geologists.

1589
02:15:19,529 --> 02:15:22,115
Geologists whose hands
aren't all chewed up.

1590
02:15:22,198 --> 02:15:26,327
Lowell, do not screw this up.

1591
02:15:26,411 --> 02:15:28,830
We are a week away from an arrest.

1592
02:15:28,913 --> 02:15:31,082
So I'll hold it. And?

1593
02:15:31,165 --> 02:15:33,751
We'll give you a heads-up
before we launch.

1594
02:15:33,835 --> 02:15:35,586
- How long?
- Three hours.

1595
02:15:35,670 --> 02:15:37,005
You got a deal.

1596
02:15:53,104 --> 02:15:56,774
WALLACE: Like the testimony before
Congress of Dr. Wigand's former boss,

1597
02:15:56,858 --> 02:16:00,486
Brown & Williamson's chief
executive officer, Thomas Sandefur.

1598
02:16:00,570 --> 02:16:03,156
believe that nicotine is not addictive.

1599
02:16:03,239 --> 02:16:05,308
believe Mr. Sandefur perjured himself

1600
02:16:05,333 --> 02:16:07,410
because I watched those testimonies
very carefully.

1601
02:16:07,493 --> 02:16:09,037
WALLACE: All of us did.

1602
02:16:09,120 --> 02:16:11,456
mean,
there was this whole line of people,

1603
02:16:11,539 --> 02:16:14,125
whole line of CEOs up there,
all swearing.

1604
02:16:14,208 --> 02:16:17,170
Part of the reason I'm here is that I felt

1605
02:16:17,253 --> 02:16:19,422
that their representation...

1606
02:16:48,910 --> 02:16:50,728
...more rapidly absorbed in the lung

1607
02:16:50,812 --> 02:16:53,139
and therefore affect
the brain and central nervous system.

1608
02:17:18,231 --> 02:17:20,108
- Hello?
- Jim, it's Lowell.

1609
02:17:20,191 --> 02:17:22,902
- Hey, where are you?
- Remember that night at PJ's?

1610
02:17:22,985 --> 02:17:25,446
You asked me if we were sitting
on something explosive.

1611
02:17:25,530 --> 02:17:27,073
Well, we're not sitting on it.

1612
02:17:27,156 --> 02:17:30,910
CBS Corporate leaned on CBS News,
which yanked an interview we did

1613
02:17:30,993 --> 02:17:34,831
with a top-ranking tobacco scientist,
corporate officer.

1614
02:17:34,914 --> 02:17:37,166
They're trying to close down the story.

1615
02:17:37,250 --> 02:17:40,545
You mean, 60 Minutes is letting
CBS Corporate

1616
02:17:40,628 --> 02:17:42,755
decide what is or is not news?

1617
02:17:42,839 --> 02:17:45,425
What's Wallace think about this?
Or Hewitt, or...

1618
02:17:45,508 --> 02:17:47,635
How prominent?
What kind of placement?

1619
02:17:47,969 --> 02:17:51,514
Oh, come on, Lowell. This is
The New York Times. I don't know.

1620
02:17:51,597 --> 02:17:55,268
Well, until you do, all I can
tell you is what you already know.

1621
02:17:55,351 --> 02:17:57,353
They will not air an interview.

1622
02:17:58,187 --> 02:17:59,730
Call me back in 10.

1623
02:18:07,864 --> 02:18:10,116
- Hello?
- Debbie, it's me.

1624
02:18:10,199 --> 02:18:12,618
Hi. What time is it?

1625
02:18:12,702 --> 02:18:13,953
Oh, it's late.

1626
02:18:14,036 --> 02:18:16,622
That I know.
When are you coming back?

1627
02:18:16,706 --> 02:18:19,792
I can't get out of here till mid-morning.
I'll be in tomorrow night.

1628
02:18:19,876 --> 02:18:23,004
Listen, could you call a number for me?
It's in Mississippi.

1629
02:18:23,463 --> 02:18:25,381
Okay. Hold on a second.

1630
02:18:28,426 --> 02:18:29,719
What is it?

1631
02:18:35,558 --> 02:18:37,476
- Hello?
- It's Lowell.

1632
02:18:37,560 --> 02:18:41,647
All right, Lowell. Page one.
Editorial's interested. Let's talk.

1633
02:18:41,731 --> 02:18:45,318
Here's how it works. You ask me
questions. I tell you if you're wrong.

1634
02:18:46,611 --> 02:18:49,864
- Lowell, you sure you want to do this?
- Why?

1635
02:18:50,489 --> 02:18:53,576
Hey, it doesn't work,
you've burned your bridges, man.

1636
02:18:54,118 --> 02:18:55,411
You ready?

1637
02:18:56,245 --> 02:18:58,831
Okay. About this whistle-blower,

1638
02:18:58,915 --> 02:19:01,626
did Mike and Don go along
with the corporate decision?

1639
02:19:03,753 --> 02:19:07,590
- Lowell?
- Did I tell you you were wrong?

1640
02:19:08,883 --> 02:19:12,720
No. I'm assuming the cave-in begins

1641
02:19:12,803 --> 02:19:15,056
with the threat of litigation
from Big Tobacco.

1642
02:19:15,139 --> 02:19:16,766
Are we talking...

1643
02:19:17,642 --> 02:19:19,810
Are we talking
Brown & Williamson here?

1644
02:19:53,302 --> 02:19:55,346
WALLACE: Did I get you up?

1645
02:19:55,638 --> 02:19:59,725
No, I usually sit around my hotel room
dressed like this at 5:30 in the morning,

1646
02:19:59,809 --> 02:20:01,727
sleepy look on my face.

1647
02:20:03,688 --> 02:20:05,565
How many shows have we done? Huh?

1648
02:20:05,648 --> 02:20:07,900
- Come on. How many?
- Oh, lots.

1649
02:20:07,984 --> 02:20:09,151
That's right.

1650
02:20:11,821 --> 02:20:14,240
But in all that time, Mike,

1651
02:20:14,323 --> 02:20:17,118
did you ever get off a plane,
walk into a room

1652
02:20:17,201 --> 02:20:20,496
and find that a source for a story
changed his mind?

1653
02:20:22,540 --> 02:20:24,750
Lost his heart? Walked out on us?

1654
02:20:24,834 --> 02:20:27,628
Not one fucking time.
You wanna know why?

1655
02:20:28,087 --> 02:20:30,256
I see a rhetorical question
on the horizon.

1656
02:20:30,339 --> 02:20:32,216
I'm gonna tell you why.

1657
02:20:32,300 --> 02:20:35,761
Because when I tell someone
I'm gonna do something, I deliver.

1658
02:20:36,304 --> 02:20:40,099
Oh, how fortunate I am to have
Lowell Bergman's moral tutelage

1659
02:20:40,182 --> 02:20:42,893
to point me down the shining
path, to show me the way.

1660
02:20:42,977 --> 02:20:45,104
- Give me a break.
- You give me a break.

1661
02:20:45,187 --> 02:20:48,316
I never left a source
hung out to dry ever.

1662
02:20:48,399 --> 02:20:51,319
Abandoned. Not till right fucking now.

1663
02:20:51,944 --> 02:20:55,156
When I came on this job,
I came with my word intact.

1664
02:20:55,239 --> 02:20:58,617
I'm gonna leave with my word intact.
Fuck the rules of the game!

1665
02:20:59,201 --> 02:21:01,329
Hell, you're supposed
to know me, Mike.

1666
02:21:01,412 --> 02:21:03,247
What the hell did you expect?

1667
02:21:03,331 --> 02:21:05,499
You expect me to lie down?

1668
02:21:06,000 --> 02:21:08,836
Back off? Or get over it?

1669
02:21:08,919 --> 02:21:13,382
In the real world, when you get to where
I am, there are other considerations.

1670
02:21:13,466 --> 02:21:16,594
Like what? Corporate responsibility?

1671
02:21:16,677 --> 02:21:18,596
What, are we talking celebrity here?

1672
02:21:18,679 --> 02:21:22,642
I'm not talking about celebrity,
vanity, CBS. I'm...

1673
02:21:24,185 --> 02:21:25,311
I'm talking about

1674
02:21:25,394 --> 02:21:28,064
when you're nearer the end
of your life than the beginning.

1675
02:21:29,231 --> 02:21:32,026
And what do you think
you think about then? The future?

1676
02:21:33,027 --> 02:21:35,571
"In the future, I'm gonna do this,
become that"?

1677
02:21:35,655 --> 02:21:37,823
What future? No.

1678
02:21:37,907 --> 02:21:39,492
What you think is...

1679
02:21:40,910 --> 02:21:43,996
"How will I be regarded in the end,

1680
02:21:44,080 --> 02:21:45,915
"after I'm gone?"

1681
02:21:47,750 --> 02:21:50,628
Oh, along the way,
I suppose I made some minor impact.

1682
02:21:51,045 --> 02:21:55,341
I did Irangate, the Ayatollah, Malcolm X,

1683
02:21:55,424 --> 02:21:58,344
Martin Luther King,
Saddam, Sadat, etc., etc.

1684
02:21:58,427 --> 02:22:03,808
I showed them thieves in suits.
I spent a lifetime building all that.

1685
02:22:06,685 --> 02:22:10,439
But history only remembers
most what you did last.

1686
02:22:12,024 --> 02:22:15,152
And should that be fronting a segment

1687
02:22:15,236 --> 02:22:18,989
that allowed a tobacco giant
to crash this network...

1688
02:22:25,079 --> 02:22:29,583
Does it give someone
at my time of life pause?

1689
02:22:33,129 --> 02:22:34,463
Yeah.

1690
02:22:42,096 --> 02:22:43,556
Mike,

1691
02:22:46,058 --> 02:22:47,601
in my...

1692
02:22:49,812 --> 02:22:52,898
You and I have been doing this

1693
02:22:52,982 --> 02:22:56,068
together for 14 years.

1694
02:22:58,571 --> 02:23:00,573
This is today's New York Times.

1695
02:23:01,323 --> 02:23:03,742
In it is the whole sordid story

1696
02:23:03,826 --> 02:23:05,911
of what went on inside our shop.

1697
02:23:07,496 --> 02:23:10,833
And in the editorial, it accuses us

1698
02:23:12,126 --> 02:23:15,087
of betraying the legacy
of Edward R. Murrow.

1699
02:23:40,362 --> 02:23:43,032
They conclude most of it
seems pretty unsubstantiated.

1700
02:23:52,166 --> 02:23:54,084
You're full of shit, John.

1701
02:24:05,721 --> 02:24:06,889
Yeah.

1702
02:24:06,972 --> 02:24:09,517
DEBBIE: Front page.
There's a picture of Wigand.

1703
02:24:09,600 --> 02:24:11,477
Article's entitled, "Getting Personal."

1704
02:24:11,560 --> 02:24:13,729
Byline to Suein Hwang
and Milo Geyelin.

1705
02:24:13,813 --> 02:24:15,564
Wait. Hold on a second, Lowell.

1706
02:24:17,233 --> 02:24:18,359
Yeah.

1707
02:24:22,613 --> 02:24:25,074
Yeah, I'll see if I can find him.

1708
02:24:25,157 --> 02:24:28,285
Yeah, hold on. Don's looking for you.

1709
02:24:28,744 --> 02:24:30,079
Good.

1710
02:24:30,162 --> 02:24:32,081
The subheading is
"Brown & Williamson

1711
02:24:32,164 --> 02:24:35,084
"has a 500-page dossier
attacking chief critic."

1712
02:24:35,167 --> 02:24:37,670
It quotes Richard Scruggs
calling it the worst kind

1713
02:24:37,753 --> 02:24:41,090
of an organized smear campaign
against a whistle-blower.

1714
02:24:41,173 --> 02:24:42,550
"A close look at the file

1715
02:24:42,633 --> 02:24:44,635
"and independent research
by this newspaper

1716
02:24:44,718 --> 02:24:48,013
"into its key claim indicates
that many of the serious allegations

1717
02:24:48,097 --> 02:24:52,768
"against Mr. Wigand are backed by
scant or contradictory evidence."

1718
02:25:12,788 --> 02:25:15,249
BERGMAN: This news division
has been vilified

1719
02:25:15,332 --> 02:25:18,419
in The New York Times,
in print, on television

1720
02:25:18,502 --> 02:25:20,087
for caving to corporate interests.

1721
02:25:20,170 --> 02:25:21,714
The New York Times
ran a blow-by-blow

1722
02:25:21,797 --> 02:25:24,133
of what we talked about
behind closed doors.

1723
02:25:24,216 --> 02:25:27,177
- You fucked us!
- No! You fucked you!

1724
02:25:27,261 --> 02:25:29,054
Don't invert stuff.

1725
02:25:29,138 --> 02:25:32,141
Big Tobacco tried to smear Wigand.
You bought it.

1726
02:25:32,224 --> 02:25:34,059
The Wall Street Journal, here,

1727
02:25:34,143 --> 02:25:37,896
not exactly a bastion
of anti-capitalist sentiment,

1728
02:25:37,980 --> 02:25:40,649
refutes Big Tobacco's smear campaign

1729
02:25:40,733 --> 02:25:43,861
as the lowest form
of character assassination.

1730
02:25:43,944 --> 02:25:46,030
And now, even now, when every word

1731
02:25:46,113 --> 02:25:48,991
of what Wigand has said
on our show is printed,

1732
02:25:49,074 --> 02:25:52,828
the entire deposition
of his testimony in a court of law

1733
02:25:52,911 --> 02:25:54,079
in the State of Mississippi,

1734
02:25:54,163 --> 02:25:57,166
the cat totally out of the bag,

1735
02:25:57,875 --> 02:25:59,960
you're still standing here debating.

1736
02:26:00,753 --> 02:26:04,006
Don, what the hell else do you need?

1737
02:26:05,174 --> 02:26:07,134
Mike, you tell him.

1738
02:26:07,217 --> 02:26:08,969
You fucked up, Don.

1739
02:26:16,352 --> 02:26:19,188
It's old news. Stick with me, like always.
We'll be okay.

1740
02:26:19,271 --> 02:26:21,357
These things have
a half-life of 15 minutes.

1741
02:26:22,566 --> 02:26:26,445
No, that's fame.
Fame has a 15-minute half-life.

1742
02:26:26,528 --> 02:26:28,489
Infamy lasts a little longer.

1743
02:26:29,365 --> 02:26:33,577
We caved. It's foolish.
It's simply dead wrong.

1744
02:26:34,286 --> 02:26:37,581
Now this is what we're going to do.
We're going over to Black Rock...

1745
02:26:41,418 --> 02:26:45,631
Okay? So let's get back to work.
Now, what we saw there

1746
02:26:45,714 --> 02:26:48,467
was two potassium chlorate

1747
02:26:48,550 --> 02:26:53,722
would yield two potassium
chloride, also a solid...

1748
02:27:04,024 --> 02:27:07,820
They canceled the 6:00.
I don't know why.

1749
02:27:08,237 --> 02:27:11,990
I'm on the 8:10. I should be home 9:30.

1750
02:27:12,408 --> 02:27:14,868
I'll see you then. I love you. Bye.

1751
02:27:29,091 --> 02:27:31,093
- Oh. Thanks, Dad.
- Thanks.

1752
02:27:43,439 --> 02:27:45,441
CBS management wouldn't
let us broadcast

1753
02:27:45,524 --> 02:27:48,861
our original story and
our interview with Jeffrey Wigand

1754
02:27:48,944 --> 02:27:51,530
because they were worried
about the possibility

1755
02:27:51,613 --> 02:27:56,201
of a multi-billion dollar lawsuit
against us for tortious interference.

1756
02:27:56,785 --> 02:27:58,954
But now things have changed.

1757
02:27:59,037 --> 02:28:01,832
What Dr. Wigand told us
was that his former...

1758
02:28:30,611 --> 02:28:33,781
MOORE: This industry, in my opinion,
is an industry

1759
02:28:33,864 --> 02:28:37,710
that has perpetrated the biggest fraud
on the American public in history.

1760
02:28:37,793 --> 02:28:39,595
They've killed millions and millions of...

1761
02:29:03,393 --> 02:29:05,595
WALLACE ON TV: You wish
you hadn't blown the whistle?

1762
02:29:06,605 --> 02:29:09,066
Yeah, there are times
I wish I hadn't done it.

1763
02:29:11,068 --> 02:29:14,488
There are times I feel compelled
to do it.

1764
02:29:16,281 --> 02:29:20,994
If you'd asked me, would I do it again,
do I think it's worth it?

1765
02:29:24,748 --> 02:29:26,708
Yeah, I think it's worth it.

1766
02:29:32,089 --> 02:29:35,551
I promised you a three-hour heads up.
Here it is.

1767
02:29:35,634 --> 02:29:39,137
Have a camera crew standing by
in Helena, Montana, on Tuesday,

1768
02:29:39,221 --> 02:29:40,973
and I'll give you a three-hour head start.

1769
02:29:41,056 --> 02:29:44,476
All right? By the way, that was
a hell of a good show tonight.

1770
02:29:44,560 --> 02:29:46,436
- Thank you, Bill.
- Yeah.

1771
02:30:05,956 --> 02:30:07,875
You won.

1772
02:30:09,251 --> 02:30:10,669
Yeah.

1773
02:30:14,548 --> 02:30:16,466
What did I win?

1774
02:30:20,095 --> 02:30:23,056
MAN ON TV: Reporting from CBS News
world headquarters in New York,

1775
02:30:23,140 --> 02:30:24,182
good afternoon.

1776
02:30:24,266 --> 02:30:27,186
There has been a major break in
the case of the so-called Unabomber.

1777
02:30:27,269 --> 02:30:29,688
CBS News has learned
that a remote homesite

1778
02:30:29,771 --> 02:30:31,732
outside of Lincoln, Montana,

1779
02:30:31,815 --> 02:30:34,693
has been under FBI surveillance
for several weeks.

1780
02:30:37,112 --> 02:30:38,614
WOMAN: Great, Lowell.

1781
02:30:47,456 --> 02:30:49,374
Thanks for this.

1782
02:30:50,250 --> 02:30:54,171
You know, we beat everybody.
ABC, NBC, CNN.

1783
02:30:58,467 --> 02:30:59,885
Mike.

1784
02:31:07,226 --> 02:31:10,979
That Canada story still interest you?

1785
02:31:11,563 --> 02:31:13,315
Everything interests me.

1786
02:31:15,984 --> 02:31:17,486
I quit, Mike.

1787
02:31:20,614 --> 02:31:22,032
Bullshit.

1788
02:31:24,034 --> 02:31:27,496
Come on. It all worked out.

1789
02:31:28,830 --> 02:31:31,083
You came out okay in the end.

1790
02:31:32,167 --> 02:31:33,543
I did?

1791
02:31:33,627 --> 02:31:37,089
What do I tell a source
on the next tough story?

1792
02:31:37,172 --> 02:31:40,384
"Hang in with us. You'll be fine. Maybe."

1793
02:31:40,467 --> 02:31:42,094
No.

1794
02:31:43,303 --> 02:31:47,683
What got broken here
doesn't go back together again.

1795
02:31:54,189 --> 02:31:55,524
So, uh...

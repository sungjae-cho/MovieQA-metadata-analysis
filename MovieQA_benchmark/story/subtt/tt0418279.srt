1
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Before time began...

2
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
There was The Cube.

3
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
We know not where it comes from.
Only that it holds

4
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
the power to create worlds
and fill them with life.

5
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
That is how our race was born.

6
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
For a time we lived in harmony.

7
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
But like all great power...

8
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Others for evil.

9
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
And so began The War.

10
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
War that ravaged our planet
until it was consumed by death.

11
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
And The Cube was lost to
the far reaches of space.

12
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
We scattered across the galaxy,
hopeing to find it and rebuild our home.

13
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Searching every star, every world...

14
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
And just when all hope seemed lost...

15
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Passage of a new discovery
took us to an unknown planet called...

16
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Earth.

17
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
But we were already too late...

18
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
God 4 months of this...
Can't wait to get a little taste of home.

19
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Play with mama's aligators... - You've
been talking abut barbecued gators

20
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
and crickets for the last 2 weeks.
I'm never going to your mama's hose, I promise.

21
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Bobby, gators are known to have
the most sucklear meat.

22
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I understand.

23
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I mean how many times...
We don't speak spanish.

24
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
That's my herritage..

25
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
You guys remember weekends?

26
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Sox and Filmway, cold hotdog
and flat beer?

27
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Perfect day...

28
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
What about you captain?
You got a perfect day?

29
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I just can't wait to hold
my baby for the first time.

30
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Watch this crossover man,
like Jordan in his prime...

31
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Step asside mates.

32
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
- Hey, what are you doing?

33
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Are you gonna help me with the gear?

34
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Colonel Sharp, we have an inbound
unidentified infiltrator.

35
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
10 miles out.

36
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Unidentified aircraft, you are
obstircting US military airspace.

37
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
and proceed East out of the area.

38
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Raptors 1 and 2, snap to
heading 250 and intercept.

39
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Bogie is in the weeds,
10 miles out, not responding.

40
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Unidentified aircraft, we'll
escort you to US SOX airbase.

41
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
If you do not comply,
we will use deadly force.

42
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
We got 10 on the bogie.
Tail 4500X.

43
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Sir it says here 4500X
was shot down 3 months ago.

44
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Afghanistan. - That's gotta be
a mistake, check again and recheck.

45
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I did sir. Friend of mine
was on that chopper.

46
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Where's the inbound?
- Bogie's 5 miles out sir.

47
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Hi my ladies!

48
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Oh my goodnes, look at her,
she's getting so big.

49
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Baby we've got a
good looking kid.

50
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I know that people say
that all the time...

51
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
We made one good looking
kid. Nice work.

52
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Sha has your laugh.
- She laughs?

53
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Her first one.

54
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Are you sure she
didn't just fart?

55
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
No, she's a lady.

56
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
She doesn't know you
yet, but she will.

57
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
4500X, something's not right.

58
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Radar's jamed.

59
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
It's coming from the chopper.

60
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Sarah if you can hear me
I love you and I'll be home soon.

61
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
FX53 pilot, power down now.

62
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Have your crew step
out or we will kill you.

63
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
My God...

64
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
They bombed that tower!
We're under attack!

65
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
They're going after the files!
Cut the hard lines!

66
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I need a key, it's locked!

67
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Ok, mr. Witwicky you're up.

68
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Sorry, I got a lot of stuff.

69
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Who did that?

70
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
People...
Responsibility.

71
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
So, for my family geneology
report, I decided to do it

72
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
On my great great grandfather.

73
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Who was a famous man.
Captain Archibald Witwicky.

74
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Very famous explorer,
infact he was one of the first

75
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
to explore...

76
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
The arctic circle,
which is a big deal.

77
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
In 1897. he took 41 brave
sailors straight in to the arctic shelf.

78
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
The ice is freezing faster
than is melting!

79
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Chop faster!

80
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,000
No sacrifice, no victory!

81
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,000
We'll get to the
arctic circle lads!

82
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
So that's the story.

83
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
And here we have some
of the basic instruments and tools

84
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
used by 19th century seamen.

85
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
This here is the quadrant,
which should be arround 80 bucks.

86
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
It's all for sale by the way.
Like the sextant here.

87
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
50 dollars for this,
this is a bargain.

88
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Theese are pretty cool.
Theese are my grandfather's glasses.

89
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Haven't quite gotten them appraised yet,
but they've seen many cool things.

90
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Are you going to sell
me his liver?

91
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Mr. Witwicky this isn't
show and sell.

92
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
This is the 11th grade, I don't
think your grandfather would be

93
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
particulary proud of what
you're doing. - I know, I'm sorry.

94
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
This all is going to
my car fund.

95
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,000
You tell your folks, it's on eBay.
I take PayPal, cold hard cash works too.

96
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Compas makes a great gift for Columbo's day.

97
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Unfortunately, my great great
grandfather, the genius that he was...

98
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Wound up going blind
and crazy on a sych ward.

99
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Drawing theese strange
symbols, babling on about some...

100
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Giant ice man that he
thought he saw...

101
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,000
OK, might be a pop
quiz tomorrow, might not!

102
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Sleep in fear tonight.

103
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Pretty good right?

104
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I'd say a solid B minus.

105
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
A B minus?
- You were hacking yor

106
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
great grandfather's
crap in my classrom.

107
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Can you do me a favour? Can you look out
the window for a second and see my father?

108
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
He's the guy in the green car.

109
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I'll tell you about a dream,
a boy's dream.

110
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
And a man's promice to that boy.

111
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
He looked him in the eyes and
said: "Son, I'm, gonna buy you a car."

112
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
But I want you to bring me
2000$ and 3 A's.

113
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I got the 2000 and 2 A's.

114
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Here's the dream.
Your B minus... dream gone.

115
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Sir just ask yourself...

116
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,000
What would Jesus do?

117
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
A minus.

118
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Wait, I can't see.
It's an A.

119
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
So I'm good?
- You're good.

120
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I got a little surprise
for you son.

121
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
What kind of surprise?
- Little surprise.

122
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
You gotta be kidding me!
- Yeah, I am.

123
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,000
You're not getting a Porsche.

124
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
You think that's funny?
- Yea I think it's funny.

125
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
What's wrong with you?
- Did you think I'd get you a porsche?

126
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,000
For your first car? - I don't want to
talk to you for the rest of my life.

127
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,000
C'mon it's just a car.
- It's no funny joke.

128
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Get your cousin out of that damn
clown sute, he's having a heat stroke again.

129
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Scarrying away folks.
- I'm hot, makeup's melting, hurts my eyes.

130
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Here? No, no, no what is this?
- You said half of car not half of peace of crap.

131
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
When I was your age I'd
be happy with 4 wheels and an engine.

132
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Let me explain something to you.
You ever seen "40 year old virgin"?

133
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,000
That's what this is,
and this is 50 year old virgin.

134
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
You want me to live that life?
- No sacrifice...

135
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
No victory, yeah i got it.
The old Witwicky moto.

136
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Gentlemen.

137
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Bobby Bolivia, like the country
except without the runks.

138
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,000
How can I help? - Well my
son here is looking to buy his first car.

139
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
You come to see me?
- Had to.

140
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
That practically makes us familly.
Uncle Bobby B baby.

141
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Uncle Bobby B.
- Sam.

142
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Let me talk to you.

143
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Sam, your first enchilada
of freedom...

144
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Awaits underneeth one of those hoods.

145
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Let me tell you something son.
A driver don's pick a car.

146
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
A car picks the driver.

147
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Some mystical bond between
a man and a machine.

148
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Son I'm a lot of things,
liar is not one of them.

149
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Especially not in front
of my mammy.

150
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,000
That's my mammy.

151
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Don't be like that...
If I had a rock I'd bust your ass bitch.

152
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,000
She's deaf, you know.

153
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Over here... every piece
of car man might want or need.

154
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,000
So it's got racing stripes.
- Yeah, it's got racing...

155
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
What the heck is this?
I know nothing about this car.

156
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Manny!
- What?

157
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
What is this?
This car, check it out.

158
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I don't know boss.
I've never seen that.

159
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Feels good.

160
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,000
How much?
- Well...

161
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Considering the semi classic
nature of the vehicle...

162
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
With the slick wheel and a
custom paint job... - But the paint's faded.

163
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Yeah, but it's custom.
- It's custom faded?

164
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Well it is your first car
and I don't expect you to understand.

165
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,000
5 grand.
- No, I'm not paying over 4. Sorry.

166
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Kid, c'mon get out of the car.
- No, you said cars pick their drivers.

167
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Sometimes it picks a driver
with a cheap ass father, out of the car.

168
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,000
There's a fiesta with racing stripes over there.
- No, I don't wanna a fiesta with racing stripes.

169
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,000
This is a classic engine right here.
I sold a car the oder day...

170
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Manny get your clown cousin and get
some hammers and come bang this stuff out baby!

171
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,000
That one's my favourite.
It drove all the way from Alabama.

172
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,000
4 thousand.

173
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Hello Mr. secretary.

174
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,000
They're so young.
-They are top subject matter experts sir.

175
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
NSA is recruiting right out
of high schools theese days.

176
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Guys, that's the secretary of defense.
- I', so underdressed.

177
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Ladies and gentlemen,
secretary of defense.

178
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Please be seated.

179
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
I'm John Keller.

180
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Obviously you've wondered why
you are here, so theese are the facts.

181
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:49,000
At 19:00 local time yesterday.
Saxon forward operations base at Qatar was attacked.

182
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,000
So far as we know, there were no survivors.

183
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,000
The objective of the attack was
to hack our military network.

184
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,000
We're not sure exactly what they were after,
but we do know that they were cut off during the assault.

185
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Which leads us to assume
they are going to try again.

186
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
No one has taken the
responsibility for the attack.

187
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
And the only real lead
we have so far...

188
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Is this sound.

189
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,000
That's the signal
that hacked our network.

190
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,000
NSA is working at full capacity to analize
it and intercept further communications.

191
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
But we need your help
to find out who did this

192
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,000
You've all shown considerable ability
in the area of signals analisis.

193
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
We're on a hair trigger here people.

194
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,000
The president has dispatched battle
groups to the Arabian Gulf and the Yellow Sea.

195
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
This is a real

196
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,000
I will leave you to your officer in charge,
break up into teams and start your work.

197
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Good luck to us all.

198
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Got the car,
now I need a girl.

199
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Any money to count
the girls would do.

200
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
0 bids.

201
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Great, broke.

202
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Come on MOjo,
you want your pain pill?

203
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
It's like clockwork.

204
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,000
I know you're wasting theese
things, so I better get you sleeping outside.

205
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
That's it for today.
No more.

206
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Crackhead.

207
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Ron this one is uneaven.
- Yea probably.

208
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
This one is bobbing.
- I'll take care of that.

209
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Couldn't we have hired a professional?

210
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,000
I do not like footprints on my grass.
- There's no footprints.

211
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
That's why I built my path.
So why don't you go from my grass on to my path.

212
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
It's family grass dad.
- When you own your own grass you'll understand.

213
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,000
This, I can't do it anymore.
You're putting girl jewlery on a boy dog.

214
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
He's got enugh self esteeme
issues cos he's a chiuaha.

215
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,000
That's his bling.
I wan't you home by 11 o' clock.

216
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Yea allright.
- 11 o' clock.

217
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Please, for the love of God
drive seafely.

218
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
You are so cheap.

219
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:23,000
That's his first car.
It's suposed to be like that.

220
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,000
A this time, we can't confirm
whether there were any survivors.

221
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Our bases worldwide are as
of now Defcon Delta.

222
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Our highest readiness level.

223
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,000
We are dealing with a very effective weapon
system we that have not come across before.

224
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Our prayers are with the families of the brave
men and women... - Daddy's going to be ok.

225
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
I've never seen a weapon
system like this.

226
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Thermal shows this weird aura arround
the egzoskeleton like it's cloacked

227
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:01,000
by some kind of invisible force field.

228
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
except in comic books
stuff, right?

229
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Man I don't know. My momma, she
had a gift, you know.

230
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:11,000
She saw things.

231
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
That thing that attacked us...

232
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
I gotta feeling it ain't over.

233
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,000
How about you use those magical voodoo
powers and get us the hell outta here.

234
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:23,000
When I took that picture,
I think it saw me.

235
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
It looked right at me.

236
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
We gotta get this thing back to the Pentagon right
away, they gotta know what we're dealing here.

237
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Radio's fried.
I got no communication with Ariel.

238
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
How far do you live from here?
- Not far, just up that mountain.

239
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Do you have a phone?
- Yes.

240
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Allright, let's hit it.

241
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Dude, are you sure
we're invited to this party?

242
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Of course Miles, it's a lake.
Public property.

243
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Oh my God. Oh my Gdd, dude,
Mikaela is here.

244
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Just don't do anything weird, allright?

245
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,000
I'm good right?
- Yeah, you're good.

246
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Hey guys, check it out.

247
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Hey bro, that car...
It's nice.

248
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
So what are you guys doing here?

249
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
We're here to climb this tree.

250
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
I see that, it looks fun.

251
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:29,000
I thought I reckognized you, you tried
out for the football team last year right?

252
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Let's go call your mum.

253
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,000
That wasn't like a real try out.
I was researching a book I was writing.

254
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,000
What's it about?
Sucking at sports?

255
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,000
No, it's about the link between brain
damage and football.

256
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
I tell you it's a good book,
your friends will love it.

257
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,000
It's got mazes in it, little coloring
areas, sections, pop up pictures...

258
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,000
A lot of fun.
- That's funny.

259
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:09,000
You gotta get off the tree right now.
Just, get off the tree right now please.

260
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
What are you doing?
- You said it's fun.

261
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
All the chicks were watching...
- You're making me look like an idiot.

262
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
We both look like idiots.

263
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,000
How about you let me drive?
- No, this is not a toy.

264
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Theese 22, I don't want you grind them.

265
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Why doesn't my little bunny
just hop in the back seat?

266
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:31,000
I can't even tell you how
much I'm not your little bunny.

267
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,000
You'll call me.

268
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Hey what's wrong
with your radio?

269
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
I'm driving her home today.
- What?

270
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
She's an evil jock concubine
man, let her hitchhike.

271
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
She lives 10 miles from here,
it's my only chance.

272
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Try to understand me here.
- Ok, we'll put here in the back, I'll be quiet.

273
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Did you say put her in the back?
Miles I'm not putting her in the back

274
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
You gotta get out of my car right now.
What rules?

275
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Bros before hoes.
- Miles, you gotta get out of my car.

276
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,000
You can't do this to me.
- You gotta get out of my car right now.

277
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,000
It's Sam...
Witwicky

278
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Hope you're not stranded
or anything... Sure?

279
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
So listen, I was wondering if I
could ride you home...

280
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,000
I mean, give you a ride home,
in my car to your house.

281
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
I can't believe that I'm here right now.

282
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,000
You can talk down if you want,
it won't hurt my feelings.

283
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,000
I didn't mean here you,
I just mean here like

284
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
in this situation.

285
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Same situation that I'm always in.
I don't know, I guess I just have a

286
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,000
weakness for hot guys, for tight
abs and big arms.

287
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Big arms?

288
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
There's couple of new additions in the car.

289
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Like, I've just put in that
light there...

290
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,000
And that disco ball, light
reflects of the disco ball.

291
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Are you new to school this year?
Is this your first year?

292
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,000
No, we've been in the same
school since first grade. - Really?

293
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Do we have any classes together?
- Yeah, history...

294
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Language arts, math, science...
- Sam... Sam, yes...

295
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Sam Wilckeky...

296
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Witwicky... - I know,
I'm so sorry.

297
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,000
I just didn't reckognize you.
- That's understandable.

298
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Just working out the cakes...

299
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:03,000
This radio is like...

300
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Look this isn't something...

301
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Look I wouldn't try this on you.

302
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:13,000
This is like a romantic thing
that I'm not trying to do.

303
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
I'm a friend of yours, I'm
not a romantic friend.

304
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Romantic friends do this.
I mean, I'm not that friend.

305
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,000
I mean we...
I could be...

306
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Just pop the hood.

307
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Nice huders... You got hi res
double pump carborator...

308
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
That's pretty impressive Sam.

309
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Double pump? - It squirts
the fuel in so you can go faster.

310
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
I like to go faster.

311
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:47,000
It looks like your distributor cap
is a little loose.

312
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
How did you know that?

313
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:55,000
My dad, he was a real greasemonkey.
Tought me all about this.

314
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:00,000
I could take it all apart, clean it
put it back together.

315
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Well you know, I don't really
broadcast it. Guys don't like it

316
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,000
when you know more
about cars than they do.

317
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Especially not Trent.
He hates it.

318
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,000
I'm cool with females
working on my engine.

319
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
I prefere it actualy.

320
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Ok, you wanna fire it up for me?

321
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,000
I was thinking, if Trent is souch
a jerk, why do you hang out with him?

322
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,000
You know what, I'm gonna walk.

323
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Good luck with your car.

324
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Allright...
Walking's healthy...

325
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,000
C'mon, please...
Don't let her walk away...

326
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Wait a second!

327
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
There it is.

328
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:15,000
I had fun, so...
Thanks for listening.

329
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,000
You don't think I'm shallow?

330
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:27,000
I think... There's a lot
more than meets the eye...

331
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,000
With you.

332
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Allright, I'll see you at school.

333
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Stupid...
That was a stupid line.

334
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:57,000
I love my car.

335
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Guys, I think the other team
figuered it out.

336
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Iran. - This is way to smart
for Iranian scientists.

337
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Think about it.
- What do you think?

338
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Chineese? - No way, this
is nothing like what the chineese are using.

339
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Mr. President? - Can you rangle me up
some ding dongs darling?

340
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
- Neprevedeni titl -

341
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:15,000
I'll be in storage.

342
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Did you hear that?

343
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Are you getting this?
Like they are hacking the network again.

344
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Oh my God, this is a direct
match to the signal in Qatar.

345
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Are you running a diagnostic?
- Should I be?

346
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Yes you should.
- So I am.

347
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:05,000
Someone! They are hacking into
Air Force 1.

348
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
I think they're planting a virus.
- A virus?

349
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Streaming right now. - They are planting a virus and
stealing whole lot of data at the same time.

350
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Code red, we have a breach.

351
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
You got to cut the hard lines.
- What?!

352
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Whatever they want, they are getting it.
- Sir, permission to take down the defence network.

353
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Cut all server hard lines now.
- Cut all server hard lines now.

354
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Someone's tampered with
the mainframe.

355
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
I want our president
in our bunker.

356
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:36,000
And I don't want to discuss
a damn thing other till that becomes reality.

357
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,000
That's pur first priority,
that's our only priority right now.

358
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Air Force 1 is on the ground.

359
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:52,000
That's my car!

360
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Dad call the cops!

361
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Where are you going with
my car buddy, where are you going?

362
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Hello 911 emergency?!
My car's been stolen!

363
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,000
I'm in pursuit, I need all units,
the whole squadron!

364
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Bring everyone! Don't ask me questions,
my father is on a neighbourhood watch.

365
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Oh my God...

366
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:15,000
My name is Sam Witwicky.
Whoever finds this, my cyr is alive.

367
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,000
These are my last words ever
I just want to say mom, dad I love you.

368
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
And if you find "Busty Beauties"
under my bed

369
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,000
it wasn't mine I'm holding it for Miles.

370
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
That's not true, it's mine
and uncle Charles gave it to me, I'm sorry.

371
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Mojo I love you.

372
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
Please don't kill me I'm sorry.

373
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Take the keys, I don't want to touch you.

374
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
Good you're here.
- Let me see the hands!

375
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:16,000
It's not me, the guy's inside.
- Shut up!

376
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,000
Walk towards the car.

377
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:23,000
Put your head on the hood.

378
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Whoever did this finally managed
to infiltrate our defense network

379
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,000
which is what they've tried to do in Qatar
only this time it worked.

380
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
What did they get?
- We still don't know.

381
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
Talk to me about the virus.

382
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
It's a spider bug virus.
We're not sure what it's going to do

383
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:48,000
but it may cripple the system.
- Can westop it?

384
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Every time we try an antivirus
it adapts and speeds up.

385
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,000
It's like it's not a virus anymore
it's become the system.

386
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Obviously the first phase
of major attack against the US.

387
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Only countries with this kind of
capability are Russia, North Korea maybe China.

388
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
I'm sorry, that's not correct.

389
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Excuse me young lady I did not
see you standing there

390
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,000
You would be who?
- Just an analist that detected the hack.

391
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,000
Hold on, it was you?

392
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
You did it?
- Her team.

393
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Sir I was trying to say...
They hacked your firewall in 10 seconds.

394
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:19,000
Even a supercomputer with a brute
force attack would take 20 years to do that.

395
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,000
Maybe you can explain then how
our latest satellite imagery

396
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
shows North Korea doubleing
its naval activities...

397
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:29,000
Maybe it's a precocion becouse
isn't that what we're doing?

398
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:33,000
Signal pattern is learning, it's evolving
on its own and you need to move past

399
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:37,000
furyair transfers and start
considering quantum mechanics.

400
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
There is nothing on Earth
that complex.

401
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,000
What about an organism?
A living organism, maybe some kind of

402
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:46,000
DNA based computer...
I know that that sounds crazy...

403
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
That's enough.

404
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,000
We have 6 floors
working on this thing.

405
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
Now if you can find proof to
back up your theory

406
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
I'm going to be happy to
listen to you.

407
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
But if you don't put a
filter on your brain - mouth theme

408
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:01,000
you're going to off the team.
You understand?

409
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:09,000
I can't be any clearer,
on how crystal clear I am being.

410
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:14,000
It just stood up.
- Just stood up?

411
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
It's really neat.

412
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Ok, time to fill her up.

413
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
I'm not on any drugs.
- What's this?

414
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:31,000
Found it in your pocket.
Mojo...

415
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
Is that what you kids are doing now?

416
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:37,000
Those are my dog's pain pills.
- Yeah, chiuaha...

417
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:44,000
What was that?

418
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:48,000
You eyeballing my peace?

419
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,000
You wanna go?
Make something happen, do it.

420
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Cos I promice you,
I will bust you up.

421
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:00,000
Are you on drugs?

422
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:08,000
Let's hope this
telephone line works.

423
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:24,000
What the heck was that?

424
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:30,000
English dude, english.

425
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:42,000
Where's your pappa?!

426
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Sir I need a telephone...

427
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:55,000
This is an emergency Pentagon call...
Do you understand, this is an emergency...

428
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
I don't have a credit card!

429
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:04,000
Sir the attitude is not going to
speed things up, anything at all.

430
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:08,000
I'm going to ask you to speak
into the mouth peace very clearly...

431
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
I'm in a middle of a war!

432
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Pretty rediculos!

433
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:19,000
I need a credit card!

434
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,000
Where's your wallet?!
- Pocket!

435
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:25,000
Which pocket?
- My back pocket!

436
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:29,000
You don't have a back pocket!
- Left jink!

437
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,000
Also sir, have you heard about our
premium plus service call package?

438
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:41,000
No I don't want a premium package!

439
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:49,000
Give me a status? - Sir we're tracking
a spec ops team under fire in Qatar.

440
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:54,000
They say they are survivors
at the base attack. - Survivors.

441
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:00,000
I've never seen this in my life!
Need gunships on station ASAP!

442
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:04,000
Predators coming up in a minute.
- Linking a call to the nearest AWAC

443
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:13,000
Man if you've seen this shit...
- Predator ETA 2 minutes.

444
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:34,000
What is that?

445
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:41,000
We need air support and we need it now.
Roll in strike package B on unknown target.

446
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:03,000
7 man team, north of
orange smoke!

447
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:12,000
Attack to Rich and Wess,
you're cleared hot!

448
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
The heat's coming!
- Laser target!

449
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:27,000
We got to beam light it for incoming!
Link target!

450
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:37,000
The heat's coming!

451
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
No freakin way!
That thing is still not down!

452
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:01,000
Ok 32 use .105 shells.
Bring the rain.

453
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:06,000
Be advised, ground team is
requesting .105 sable rounds.

454
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:36,000
Did we loose it?
- Warthog 1 confirm visual on frendlies.

455
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:44,000
Where is Frank?

456
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:50,000
Get a medic!

457
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:01,000
Bring them home.

458
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:05,000
Get those men stateside right now.
I want them debriefed in 10 hrs.

459
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:16,000
There's only one hacker in the world
that can brake this code.

460
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:35,000
I'm sorry to bother you.
- Maggie...

461
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
I need your help.
- No, this is my private area...

462
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:41,000
my place of zen and peace.
Shut up grandma!

463
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
What are you doing here?
- Just give me a break will you?

464
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:49,000
Grandma cut the proone juice!

465
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:57,000
What level are you on?
- Sixth...

466
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:08,000
Don't you want to
see somtehing classified?

467
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:17,000
I need a moment... please.
- Sorry.

468
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
And save my game.

469
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:22,000
How classified?

470
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:26,000
Like, I will go to jail for the rest
of my life for showing you classified.

471
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
One quick peak.

472
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:32,000
Spec Ops got a thermal snapshot
of whatever hit the base in Qatar.

473
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,000
I wanna see it.
- The imager was damaged sir.

474
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:38,000
The rangers are in rout with
the imager, but we also have a security issue.

475
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:41,000
Server logs indicate one of the
analysts made a copy of the network

476
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:45,000
intrusion signal.

477
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:49,000
The signal strength is through the roof,
where did you said you got this?

478
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:53,000
Hacked the national military
airguard frequency in less than a minute.

479
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:56,000
No way...

480
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:59,000
Looks like there's a message
embedded in the signal.

481
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:03,000
Gotta be worth my magic.

482
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:10,000
Project "Iceman"?
- What's Sector 7?

483
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:13,000
Who is captain Witwicky?

484
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:16,000
Are you playing those
videogames again?

485
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:20,000
Cops!

486
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:36,000
Get off my grandma's carpet!
She don't like nobody on her carpet!

487
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
Especially police!

488
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:42,000
It was an awesome spectacle here an hour
ago when over 40 C17's lifted off this very base.

489
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:50,000
We were not told where
they're going...

490
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:59,000
Stop barking Mojo it's
too early please.

491
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:05,000
Miles listen to me.
My car, it stole itself ok?

492
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:08,000
What are you talking about man?
- Satan's Camaro in my yard.

493
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:12,000
It is stalking me.

494
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:32,000
Sam?

495
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:37,000
That was really...
Awesome.

496
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
It felt awesome.
- Are you ok?

497
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
No I'm not ok, I'm loosing
my mind a little bit.

498
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
Getting chased by my car
right now, I gotta go.

499
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:47,000
You know what, I'm gonna
go, I'll check with you guys later.

500
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:21,000
Great, the cops.

501
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
Officer!

502
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:30,000
Listen...

503
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:34,000
That hurt.

504
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
Listen to me.
Thank God you're here.

505
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:40,000
I've had the worst day ever.
I've been followed here on my mother's bike.

506
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:44,000
And my car is right there
and it has been following me here.

507
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:48,000
So get out of the car.

508
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:08,000
Please, what do you want from me?!

509
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:32,000
This is a bad dream.

510
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
Are you username LadiesMan217?
- I don't know what you're talking about!

511
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:38,000
Are you username LadiesMan217?!
- Yeah...

512
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:42,000
Where is the eBay item 21153?!
Where are the glasses?!

513
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:57,000
Get back!

514
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:05,000
What is your problem Sam?!
- There's a monster right there, it just attacked me!

515
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:09,000
Here it comes!

516
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
Sam what is that thing?
- You have to get in the car.

517
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:23,000
Get in the car.
Trust me!

518
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:48,000
We're gonna die!
- We're not gonna die!

519
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:20,000
We're locked in.

520
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:24,000
The car won't start.
Atleast we've ditched the monster, right?

521
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:48,000
He's gonna kill me!

522
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:34,000
Not so tough without
a head, are you?!

523
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:43,000
Come on.

524
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
What is it?

525
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:01,000
It's a robot.

526
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
He's probably Japaneese.

527
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:11,000
He's definetly Japaneese.

528
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
What are you doing?

529
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:16,000
I don't think he wants to hurt us.
He would have done that already.

530
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:20,000
Really? Well do you speak robot, because
they just had a giant twin deathmatch.

531
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:27,000
I think he wants something from me.
- What?

532
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:30,000
Because the other one was
talking about my eBay page.

533
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:34,000
You're the strangest
boy I have ever met.

534
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:38,000
Can you talk?

535
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:43,000
So you talk through the radio?

536
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:48,000
So what was that last night?
What was that?

537
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
"Visitors from heaven"...
What?

538
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:58,000
Are you like an alien or something?

539
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:05,000
Any more questions
you want to ask?

540
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:08,000
He wants us to get in the car.

541
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:12,000
And go where?

542
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:48,000
This car is a pretty
good driver.

543
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
Why don't you go sit
in that seat there?

544
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:56,000
I'm not gonna sit in his
seat, he's driving.

545
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:03,000
Maybe you should sit
in my lap. - Why?

546
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:08,000
I have the only seatbelt here,
safety first.

547
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:19,000
See, that's better.

548
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:26,000
You know, that seatbelt thing
was a pretty smooth move.

549
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
Thank you.

550
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
You know what I don't understand...

551
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:34,000
Why if he's suposed to be this
super advanced robot

552
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:38,000
does he transform back into
this piece of crap camaro?

553
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:50,000
Fantastic!
Now you've pissed him off!

554
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:54,000
That car is sensitive.
4000$ just drove off.

555
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:09,000
What?

556
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
This is easilly a hundred times
cooler than Armaggedon.

557
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:39,000
I swear the God.

558
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:57,000
Sweet... Dude I hope this guy's got
assdrilling insurance cos he is so boned.

559
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:47,000
Excuse me, are you the tooth fairy?

560
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:50,000
Hey sweetheart, what are
you doing out here by yourself?

561
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:54,000
Holy cow what happened
to the pool?

562
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:28,000
Are you Samuel James Witwicky
descendant of Archibald Witwicky?

563
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:33,000
He knew your name.
- Yeah...

564
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:36,000
My name is Optimus Prime.

565
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:39,000
We are autonomus robotic organisms
from the planet Cybertron.

566
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,000
But you can call us Autobots for short.

567
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
Autobots?

568
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:47,000
What's crackin little bitches?
- My first liutenant...

569
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:51,000
Jazz... - This looks like a
cool place to kick it.

570
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
How did he learn to talk like that?

571
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:58,000
We've learned Earth's languages
through the World Wide Web.

572
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:02,000
My weapons specialist, Ironhide.

573
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:06,000
You feeling lucky punk?
- Easy Ironhide.

574
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:10,000
Just kidding, I just wanted
to show him my talents.

575
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:13,000
Our medical officer Ratchett.

576
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:17,000
The boy's pheromone levels suggest
he wants to mate with the female.

577
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:23,000
You already know your
guardian Bumblebee.

578
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:29,000
You're my guardian?

579
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:33,000
His vocal processor was damaged in battle.
We've been still working on him.

580
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:42,000
Why are you here?
- We are here looking for the Allspark.

581
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:45,000
And we must find it
before Megatron.

582
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:49,000
Mega what?

583
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:01,000
Our planet was once
a powerful empire.

584
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:07,000
Until we were betrayed by Megatron,
leader of the Decepticons.

585
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:11,000
All that were to fight
them were destroyed.

586
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:15,000
Our war finally consumed the planet
and the Allspark was lost to the stars.

587
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:22,000
Megatron followed it to Earth.

588
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:26,000
When captain Witwicky found him.

589
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:27,000
My grandfather...

590
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:31,000
It was an accident that
intertwined our fates.

591
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:39,000
Come back!

592
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:42,000
The dogs have found something.

593
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:46,000
The ice is cracking.

594
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:01,000
I'm allright lads!

595
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:14,000
Megatron crashlanded before
he could retrieve The Cube.

596
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:22,000
Men, we've made a discovery!

597
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:26,000
He accidentaly activated
his navigation system.

598
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:42,000
The coordinates to The Cube's
location on Earth

599
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:45,000
were imprinted on his glasses.

600
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,000
How did you know
about his glasses?

601
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,000
eBay...

602
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:53,000
If the Decepticons find the Allspark...

603
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:56,000
They will use it's power to
transform Earth's machines

604
01:04:56,000 --> 01:05:00,000
and build a new army.
- And the human race will be extiguished.

605
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:06,000
Sam Witwicky, you hold
the key to Earth's survival.

606
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:15,000
Please tell me that
you have those glasses.

607
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:21,000
It's like a self regenerating
molecular armor.

608
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,000
Look at the scorch mark
where the Sable round hit.

609
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,000
Melted right through.

610
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:28,000
Aren't Sables hot loaded for
like a 6000 degree magnesium burn?

611
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
Close to it, that was tank armor.

612
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:34,000
This metal skin must
react to extreme heat...

613
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:39,000
I thought you said
that thing was dead man!

614
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,000
Strap it down!
Strap it!

615
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:42,000
This thing is wicked!

616
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:45,000
Get on a hornet northern command,
tell them that our effective weapon

617
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:49,000
is high heat Sable rounds.
Recommend we load them on all gunships, go.

618
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:57,000
You want that peace?
Ok Maggie look.

619
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:02,000
They're gonna come through
that door, play good cop bad cop.

620
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:03,000
That's why I ate their food.

621
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:06,000
They put the plate of donuts
here to test your guilt.

622
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
If you don't touch it you're guilty.

623
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:12,000
I ate the whole plate.
The whole plate.

624
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:16,000
It's me and you. They walk
through that door, you don't say nothing.

625
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
She did it! She did it!
She's the one you want!

626
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:35,000
I was just sitting home watching
cartoons, playing videogames with my cousin

627
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:38,000
and she came in there, allright?
- Glenn you freak!

628
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
I am not going to jail
for you or anybody else.

629
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:43,000
I have done nothing bad
my entire life.

630
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,000
Hey man, I'm still a virgin.

631
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:48,000
So what, i've downloaded a
couple of thousand songs off the internet

632
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
who hasen't?!

633
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
Glenn sut up!
- No, you shut up!

634
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:56,000
Don't talk to me!
Don't talk to me criminal!

635
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,000
Sugar rush.
- This is not his fault.

636
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:02,000
Can I go home now?

637
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:03,000
Just listen to me.

638
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:06,000
Whoever hacked into your
military system, downloaded a file.

639
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:09,000
It was something about
someone named Witwicky...

640
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:13,000
And some goverment group
named Sector 7.

641
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:17,000
You have to let me talk to defense secretary
Keller before you go to war with the wrong country.

642
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
What did he say?
Did he hear it too?

643
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
Jack heard it too.
- What does he think it is?

644
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
He thinks it's a military experiment.

645
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:30,000
Well I think it's a plane.

646
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:38,000
Call Sam, he should be
home in 15 minutes.

647
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:39,000
Well I'll call him in 15 minutes.
- If you wait 15 minutes he'll be late

648
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:43,000
and you'll have to ground him.
- I can't ground him if he's not late, can I?

649
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:51,000
Just stay here, allright?
You have to stay here and watch them.

650
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:54,000
You hear what I'm saying?
5 minutes, allright?

651
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:57,000
Thanks for staying on my path.

652
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,000
Oh the path, I'm sorry I
forgot about the path.

653
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,000
I'm gonna sweep the whole
thing right now, how about that?

654
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:04,000
I buy half of your car,
I bail you out of jail,

655
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:07,000
and then I just decided to
do all your chors.

656
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:11,000
Life is great.
- Life is fantastic, that's how good it is.

657
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
The trash can, sorry dad,
I'm gonna do the trash cans, allright?

658
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:17,000
No, I don't want you
to strain yourself.

659
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:18,000
Dad, you'll hurt my feelings
if you do it.

660
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:21,000
I promise... No, no, I'm gonna do it.

661
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:25,000
I'm gonna do the trash cans and I'm gonna
scrape the grill and I'm gonna...

662
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,000
Sweep up the whole house
right now.

663
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:31,000
Right now?
- Right now.

664
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:35,000
I love you.
God I love you.

665
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:38,000
Just so much right now.
- You know, your mom wanted me to ground you.

666
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
You're 3 minutes late.

667
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:44,000
Just another thing you did for me
dad, because you're such a swell guy.

668
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:48,000
Allright, I love you.
Sleep good handsome man.

669
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:50,000
What are you doing?

670
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:54,000
Watch the path!

671
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
Sorry, my bad.

672
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:02,000
You couldn't wait
for 5 minutes, I told you to stay.

673
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:10,000
I told you...
- Ok, they are in a little bit of a rush.

674
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:13,000
Mojo no!

675
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:17,000
Mojo off the robot.
God.

676
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
This is Mojo, he's a pet of
mine, he is a pet.

677
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
That's all.

678
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
Put the guns away,
put them away.

679
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:29,000
You have a rodent infestation,
shall I terminate?

680
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:32,000
He's not a rodent, he is a chiuaha.
This is my chiuaha.

681
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:36,000
We love chiuahas don't we?
-He has leaked lubricants all over my foot.

682
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:42,000
He pied on you?
Bad Mojo!

683
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:46,000
Bad Mojo!

684
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:50,000
It's gonna rust.

685
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:56,000
Just hurry

686
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:02,000
Autobots recon.

687
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:06,000
He's in the kitchen, I had to
slap him arround.

688
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:11,000
You did not.

689
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:15,000
You didn't even ground him.
- Almost, almost.

690
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:31,000
Time is short.
- They really want those glasses.

691
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:36,000
Please hurry.

692
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
No, no, it's definetly gone.
- What do you mean?

693
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
Glasses were in the bag, they were
in the backpack, now the backpack isn't here.

694
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
Well they're gonna be
pissed, so what do you want to do?

695
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
What I think you should do,
you should check this whole

696
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
this whole section here.
Give it a clean sweep.

697
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
And I'll get the corner here.

698
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:51,000
Not there, that's my private.
Sorry.

699
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:55,000
You just told me... - I didn't mean to
look inside of my treasure chest.

700
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:59,000
You should be way more specific...

701
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,000
This isn't hiding.
This isn't hiding.

702
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:12,000
This is my back yard,
not a truck stop.

703
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:16,000
I saw it. UFO landed
right here and now is gone.

704
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:20,000
My moped is under there
man, who's gonna pay for that?

705
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:25,000
Sam he's back.
Ok I'll deal with this.

706
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:28,000
What?! No, no, no
these are my mother's flowers.

707
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,000
Listen, you gotta listen to me.
If my parents come out here

708
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:33,000
and they see you, they're gonna
freak out. My mom's got a temper.

709
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:35,000
We must have the glasses.
- I know you need the glasses.

710
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:38,000
I've been looking everywhere,
they're not here, they're definetly not here.

711
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:42,000
Keep searching.
- I need you to be quiet for 5 minutes.

712
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,000
Please, I'm begging you.
I can't concentrate.

713
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:48,000
You want me to look...
- Calm down.

714
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:49,000
You gotta do something.

715
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:53,000
Autobots, fall back.
- Please for 5 minutes.

716
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:57,000
Move! - What's the matter
with you, can't you be quiet?

717
01:11:57,000 --> 01:12:01,000
He wants us to be quiet...

718
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:07,000
Earthquake! Move, move,
move, earthquake!

719
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:10,000
Judy get under the table,
move it!

720
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
Duck and cover right now!
- How did you get over there so fast?

721
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:15,000
That was tingleing.

722
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:19,000
Yeah, that looks fun.

723
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:31,000
What the hell is that?
- I don't know.

724
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,000
That's weird.

725
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,000
Ratchett point the light.
- Come on, hurry.

726
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,000
We've got a major issue here.
What's with the light?

727
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:40,000
You got to stop the light.
You got to tell him to shut...

728
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,000
Sam are you in there?
How come the door's locked?

729
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:46,000
You know the rules,
no doors locked in my house.

730
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
You know he'll start counting if
you don't open... - One more chance.

731
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
Oh dear.
- 5... 4...

732
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
Sam he's counting.
- It's coming of the hinge pal.

733
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:56,000
Sam just open the door.
- 3... 2...

734
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:58,000
What's up?
What's with the bat?

735
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:02,000
Who were you talking to?

736
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:07,000
I'm a child, teenager.
- We heard voices and noises...

737
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:08,000
We thought maybe...
- It doesn't matter what we thought.

738
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,000
What was that light?
- What light?

739
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:14,000
There's no light, you've
got 2 lights in your hand.

740
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,000
You can't just bounce into
my room like that.

741
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,000
You got to knock,
you got to comunicate.

742
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,000
We did, we knocked...
- We knocked!

743
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,000
You didn't knock, you were
screaming at me.

744
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:25,000
This is repressioning what you're
doing here, you're ruining my youth.

745
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:28,000
Oh for Pete's sakes,
you are so defensive.

746
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:32,000
Were you masturbating?

747
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:35,000
Judy...
- Was I... No mum!

748
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,000
I don't masturbate.
- That's not something for you to bring up.

749
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:39,000
That's a father and son thing.
- Father and son thing.

750
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:41,000
We don't have to call it that word if
that makes you unconformtable.

751
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:44,000
You can call it "Sam's happy time".

752
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:48,000
Or "My special alone time".
- Stop, Judy stop.

753
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:53,000
I'm sorry, it's just been a weird
night, I had a little bit to drink.

754
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:57,000
Well we saw a light.
- Parents.

755
01:13:57,000 --> 01:14:01,000
Whatever it was, but we saw it.

756
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:05,000
Earthquake, another one!
Get in the doorway!

757
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,000
Aftershock, aftershock.

758
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:11,000
God I hate these.

759
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:13,000
Quick hide!

760
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:20,000
Oh no, look at the yard,
the yard is destroyed.

761
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:28,000
Judy better call the city,
we've got a blown transformer.

762
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:31,000
Power pole's sparkling all over the place...

763
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:35,000
Oh man, the yard's a waste.
Crashed, gone.

764
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:40,000
The parents are wery iritating.
Can I take them out?

765
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:44,000
Ironhide you know we don't
harm humans. What is with you?

766
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:48,000
Well I'm just saying we could.

767
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:51,000
We heard you talking to somebody
Sam, we want to know who.

768
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:54,000
Hi, I'm Mikaela.

769
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:58,000
I'm a friend of Sam's.

770
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,000
Gosh, you're gorgeous.

771
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:04,000
She can hear you talking mom.
- Thank you.

772
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:08,000
Oh my godness, I'm sorry
you had to hear our little family discussion.

773
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:12,000
Where's my backpack mom?
- It's in the kitchen.

774
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,000
Your mom's so nice.

775
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:36,000
I want you to distract my parents
while I sneak out theese glasses.

776
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,000
Ronald Wickedy?
- Witwicky, who are you?

777
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,000
The goverment, sector 7.

778
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,000
Never heard of it.
- Never will.

779
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:51,000
Your son is a grat grandson
of captain Archibald Wickedy, is he not?

780
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:52,000
It's Witwicky.

781
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:56,000
May I enter the premesis sir?

782
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:59,000
Ron there's guys all
over the front yard.

783
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:02,000
What the heck's going on here?
- Your son filed a stolen car report last night

784
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,000
we think it's envolved in a
national security matter.

785
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:08,000
National security?
- That's right, national security.

786
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,000
Look at this!
- Would you stay off the grass?!

787
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:17,000
Get me a sample and some
isotope readings.

788
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:18,000
They gotta get their
hands off my bush.

789
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:21,000
Drop the bat ma'am,
I'm carrying a loaded weapon.

790
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:25,000
You better get those guys out of my garden
or I'm gonna beat the crap out of them.

791
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:29,000
Are you experiencing any
flue like simptoms? - Ne!

792
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:32,000
What is this?
- How you doing son!

793
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
Is your name Sam?
- Yeah...

794
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
I need you to come with us...
- You're way out of line!

795
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:40,000
Sir I am asking politely.
Back off.

796
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,000
You're not taking my son.
- Really?

797
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:45,000
You're gonna try to get ruf with us?
- No but I'm gonna call the cops.

798
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,000
Because there's something
fishy going on arround here.

799
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:51,000
There's something a little fishy
about you, your son and your little taco bel dog

800
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:54,000
and this whole operation
you've got going on here.

801
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,000
What operation?
- That is what we are gonna find out.

802
01:16:56,000 --> 01:17:00,000
I think, direct contact.

803
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:10,000
Step forward please.

804
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:18,000
14 rads...

805
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,000
Bingo!
Tag'em and bag'em!

806
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:23,000
You hurt my dog
I'll kick your ass.

807
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:26,000
Sam do not say anything!

808
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:30,000
Not a word until we get a lawyer.

809
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:36,000
So... LadiesMan217...

810
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:41,000
That is your eBay username right?

811
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:44,000
Yeah but it was a tipo,
then I ran with it.

812
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:47,000
What do you make of this?

813
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:51,000
Is that you?
- Yeah, that sounds like LadiesMan.

814
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:55,000
Last night at the station you
told the officer your car "transformed"...

815
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:59,000
Enlighten me.
- Here's what I said.

816
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:03,000
This is a total misunderstanding
that my car had been stolen.

817
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:05,000
Really?
- From me, from my home

818
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:08,000
but it's fine now
because it's back, it came back.

819
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,000
Well, not by itself.
- Well, no.

820
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:14,000
Because cars don't do that,
because that would be crazy.

821
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:22,000
What do you kids know
about the aliens?

822
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:25,000
You mean like a martian?
ET?

823
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:28,000
It's an urban legend.
- You see this?

824
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:31,000
This is I can do whatever I want
and get away with it badge.

825
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:33,000
I'm gonna lock you up forever.

826
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:35,000
Oh God, you know what don't
listen to him he's just pissed

827
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:37,000
because he's gotta get
back to guarding the mall.

828
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:40,000
You in the train broad.
Do not test me.

829
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,000
Especialy when your
daddy's parrol coming up.

830
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
What?
Parrol?

831
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:47,000
It's nothing...
- A grand theft auto, that ain't nothing?

832
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:49,000
You know those cars my dad
used to teach me to fix...

833
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:52,000
Well they weren't always his.
- You stole cars?

834
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:56,000
We couldn't alwys afford a babysitter
so sometimes he had to take me along.

835
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,000
She's got her own jouvie
record to prove it.

836
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:02,000
She's a criminal.
Criminals are hot.

837
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:05,000
It would be a real shame
if he had to rot in jail

838
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:07,000
rest of his natural life.

839
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:11,000
It is time to talk.

840
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:44,000
You're in trouble now.

841
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,000
Gentlemen...

842
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:49,000
I wanna introduce you
to my friend.

843
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:53,000
Optimus Prime.

844
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:57,000
Taking the children
was a bad move.

845
01:19:57,000 --> 01:20:01,000
Autobots, relieve them
of their weapons.

846
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:11,000
Give me those!

847
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:24,000
Hi there...

848
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:28,000
You don't seem affraid.
Are you not surprised to see us?

849
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:34,000
There are S-7 protocols.

850
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,000
I'm not authorised to communicate
with you except to tell you

851
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:40,000
I can't communicate with you.
- Get out of the car!

852
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:45,000
Me?
- Now!

853
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:47,000
I'm getting out, you see?

854
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:51,000
Wery nifty how you put
us down without really killing us.

855
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:53,000
You're good with handcuffs too now?

856
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:57,000
You weren't suposed to
hear all that.

857
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:05,000
Sam, I have a record because
I woulnd't turn my dad and...

858
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:09,000
When did you have to sacrifice anything
in your perfect little life?

859
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:16,000
What is Sector-7?
Answer me!

860
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,000
I'm the one asks questions
arround here, not you young man!

861
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,000
How did you know about the aliens?
- Where did you take my parents?

862
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:23,000
I am not at liberty to discuss...
Hey you touch me that's a federal offense.

863
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:26,000
Do whatever you want,
get away with the badge, right?

864
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:29,000
Brave now all of a sudden
with his big alien friends standing over there.

865
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:33,000
Where is Sector-7?
- Wouldn't you like to know.

866
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:41,000
Bumblebee, stop lubricating
the man.

867
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:44,000
Get that thing to stop!

868
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:48,000
Ok tough guy, take it off.
- What are you talking about?

869
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:51,000
Your clothes, all of it, off.
- For what?

870
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:55,000
For threathening my dad.

871
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,000
Little lady...

872
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,000
This is the beginning...

873
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:04,000
Of the end of your life.

874
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,000
You're a criminal.

875
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:10,000
Let's face facts, it's in your gene pool.

876
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,000
Those are nice.

877
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:16,000
Now get behind the pole.
- This is souch a felony that you're doing.

878
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:21,000
I will hunt you down.
- Hunt you down.

879
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:24,000
Without any remorse.
- No remorse.

880
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:28,000
We've got to alert everyone.
- They already know.

881
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:32,000
Speaker.

882
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:39,000
Incoming.

883
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:49,000
Roll out!

884
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:18,000
Easy you two.

885
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:25,000
Get down on the gorund!
Get down!

886
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:32,000
Look he's not fiting back!

887
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:25,000
Happy to see me again?

888
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:29,000
Put him in the car with his
little criminal friend.

889
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:37,000
I want that thing prepd
and ready for transport!

890
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:52,000
Optimus...

891
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:55,000
Are we just gonna
stand here and do nothing?

892
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:59,000
There's no way to free
Bumblebee without harming the humans.

893
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:03,000
But it's not right...
- Let them leave.

894
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:17,000
Chineese and Russians are nearing
our area of operations in the western Pacifik.

895
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:20,000
We feel like this could
get out of hand real fast.

896
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:24,000
In the next couple of
hours they justifed his present

897
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:30,000
US and Chineese task forces
are approaching 100 miles crouse missle range.

898
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:34,000
Tell the strike group commander
that he's not to engage unless fired on first.

899
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:38,000
Yes sir.
- Mr. secretary...

900
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:43,000
Tom Banachek. I'm with sector-7,
advanced research division.

901
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:48,000
Never heard of it, I'm a little
busy Tom, I think you can see that.

902
01:27:57,000 --> 01:28:00,000
Talk to me!
- The whole room's going down sir.

903
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:03,000
I can see that.
- Virus was coded to shut us down.

904
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:06,000
I'll take a seat.

905
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,000
What do you mean shut us down?
- Then used our network to spread

906
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:11,000
out to the whole world.
The blackout's global.

907
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:14,000
We have no communication.
Satellite and land lines are dead.

908
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:18,000
You mean to tell me that I can not
pick up this telephone and call my family...

909
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:26,000
Mr. secretary...

910
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:30,000
I'm here under direct
order from the presidnet.

911
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:35,000
You really need to see
what I have in the case.

912
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:39,000
You'll have to accept that there
are certain things you won't understand

913
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:40,000
right away.

914
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:43,000
Sector-7 is a special access division
of the goverment.

915
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:47,000
Convened in secret under president
Hoover 80 years ago.

916
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:52,000
You might remember a NASA JPL
lost the Beagle 2 Mars rover...

917
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:56,000
We told them to report
the mission a complete failure.

918
01:28:56,000 --> 01:29:00,000
It wasn't...
Beagle 2 transmited 13 seconds.

919
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:05,000
This was classified above top secret.

920
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:25,000
More than just a pile
of Martian rocks.

921
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:27,000
This is the image from Mars.

922
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:31,000
Here's the image your Spec Ops team
was able to retrieve from the base attack.

923
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:36,000
We believe they are of the
same egzoskeletal type.

924
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:39,000
And obviously not Russian
or North Korean.

925
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:42,000
Are we talking abut
an invasion?

926
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:45,000
We intercepted a message
from your Spec Ops team.

927
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:48,000
These things can be hurt
by our wapons and now they know it.

928
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:52,000
That's why the virus shut us down,
so we can't coordinate against their next attack.

929
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:56,000
Which I would bet my ridiculous
goverment salary is coming.

930
01:29:56,000 --> 01:30:00,000
Soon.

931
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:03,000
Get word to our fleet commanders
over national guard frequencies

932
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:07,000
short wave radio channel,
it might still be working.

933
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:10,000
Tell them to turn their
ships arround and come home, ASAP.

934
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:14,000
And inform all commands to
prepare for imminent attack.

935
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:27,000
Captain Lennox, we need you
and your team to come with us right now!

936
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:34,000
She's in here.

937
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:37,000
What's going on?

938
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:40,000
You're coming with me.
You're gonna be my advisor.

939
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:42,000
Me too?

940
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:46,000
Who's this?
- He's my advisor.

941
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:51,000
He comes too.

942
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:03,000
What did they get you for?

943
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:05,000
I bought a car...

944
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:08,000
Turned out to be an
alien robot.

945
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:12,000
Who knew.

946
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:42,000
Please, let this work.

947
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:45,000
Fire it up Optimus.

948
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:48,000
The code...
The code on these glasses

949
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:52,000
indicates the Allspark is
230 miles from here.

950
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:58,000
I sense Deceptions are getting
ready to mobilize.

951
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:02,000
They must know is here aswell.
- What about Bumblebee?

952
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:06,000
We can't just leave him to die.
He'll undergo some human experiments.

953
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:10,000
He'll die in vein if we
don't acomplish our mission.

954
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:14,000
Bumblebee is a brave soldier,
this is what he would want.

955
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:18,000
Why are we fighting
to save the humans?

956
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:23,000
Thy are primitive,
violent race.

957
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:28,000
Were we so diferent?
They're young species.

958
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:33,000
They have much to learn.
But I've seen goodness in them.

959
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:38,000
Freedom is the right
of all sentient beings.

960
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:43,000
You all know there's only
one way to end this war.

961
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:46,000
We must destroy The Cube.

962
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:50,000
If all else fails, I will
unite it with the spark in my chest.

963
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:55,000
That's suicide, The Cube is raw
power, it could destroy you both.

964
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:59,000
A necessary sacrifice to
bring peace to this planet.

965
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:04,000
We cannot let the humans
pay for our mistakes.

966
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:07,000
It's been an honor
serving with you all.

967
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:11,000
Autobots roll out!

968
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:33,000
I got your intel, excellent work.
- Thank you sir, what about the gunships?

969
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:37,000
Being retrofitted with Sable round now.
The heatskin will be ready for them.

970
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:41,000
But, it won't do us much good if we can't
get world communications back up.

971
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:43,000
Hey kid.

972
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:47,000
I think we got off to a bad start.

973
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:50,000
You want a latte, double machiato?

974
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:53,000
Where's my car?
- Son...

975
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:57,000
I need you to listen to me
very carefuly. People could die here.

976
01:33:57,000 --> 01:34:01,000
We need to know everything you
know, we need to know it now.

977
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:06,000
First I'll take my car, my parents...
Maybe you should write that down.

978
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:10,000
And her jouvie record.
That's gotta be gone.

979
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:15,000
Come with me, we'll
talk about your car.

980
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:18,000
Thank you.

981
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:21,000
Man's an extortionist.

982
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:23,000
Allright, here's the situation.

983
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:26,000
You've all had direct contanct
with the NBE's. - NBE's?

984
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:30,000
Non Biological Extraterrestrial.
Try and keep up with the acronims.

985
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:34,000
What you are about to see
is totally classified.

986
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:45,000
Dear God, what is this?

987
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:48,000
We think, when he made his approach
over the North Pole

988
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:52,000
our gravitational field
screwed up his telemetry.

989
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:56,000
He crashed in the ice,
probably few thousand years ago.

990
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:59,000
We shiped him here to this
facility in 1934.

991
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:02,000
Call him NBE-1.

992
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:06,000
Sir I don't mean to trash on
everything you think you know but...

993
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:08,000
That's Megatron.

994
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,000
He's the leader of the Decepticons.

995
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:13,000
He's been in cryostasis since 1935.

996
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:17,000
Your great great grandfather,
made one of the gratest discoveries

997
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:21,000
in the history of mankind. - Fact is
you're looking at the source of modern age.

998
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:25,000
Microchip, lasers, space flight,
cars, all reverse engineered

999
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:30,000
by studying him, NBE-1.

1000
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:33,000
That's what we call it.

1001
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:35,000
And you didn't think the US military
might need to know

1002
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:38,000
that you're keeping a hostile
alien robot frozen in the basement?

1003
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:42,000
Until these events we had no
credible threat to national security.

1004
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:44,000
Well you got one now.

1005
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:47,000
So why Earth?
- It's the Allspark.

1006
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:49,000
Allspark?
What is that?

1007
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:51,000
They came here looking
for some cube looking thing.

1008
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:55,000
And mr. NBE-1 here, aka Megatron,

1009
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:57,000
That's what they called him.
Who's pretty much the harbinger of death

1010
01:35:57,000 --> 01:36:01,000
wants to use The Cube to transform
human technology to take over the universe.

1011
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:05,000
That's their plane.
- Are you sure about that?

1012
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:12,000
You guys know where it
is don't you?

1013
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:16,000
Follow me.

1014
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:20,000
You're about to see
our crown jewel.

1015
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:31,000
Carbon dateing puts the Cube
here arround 10000 B.C.

1016
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:35,000
The First Seven didn't find it
until 1913.

1017
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:39,000
They knew it was alien becouse of the matching
hyeroglyphics on the cube aswell as NBE-1.

1018
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:44,000
President Hoover had
the dam built arround it.

1019
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:48,000
4 football fields thick concrete,
perfect way to hide its energy

1020
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:52,000
from being detected by anyone
or any alien species on the outside.

1021
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:36,000
Back up, you said the dam hides
The Cube's energy...

1022
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:40,000
What kind exatcly?
- Good question.

1023
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:46,000
Please step inside,
they have to lock us in.

1024
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:56,000
Has Freddy Kruger been up here?
- No man, Freddy Kruger had 4 blades man

1025
01:37:56,000 --> 01:38:00,000
that's only 3, that's Wolverine.

1026
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:04,000
That's very funny.

1027
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:06,000
Anybody have any mechanical devices,
blackberries, cell phone?

1028
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:10,000
I got a phone.

1029
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:14,000
Nokia's a real nasty.

1030
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:18,000
You got to respect the Japaneese.
They know the way of the samurai.

1031
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:21,000
Nokia's from Finland.

1032
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:25,000
Yes but he's, you know...

1033
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:33,000
We're able to take The Cube radiation...

1034
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:37,000
Bundled into that box.

1035
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:51,000
Mean little sucker.
- That thing is freaky!

1036
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:55,000
Kinda like energizer
bunny from hell.

1037
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:39,000
Gentlemen, they know
The Cube is here.

1038
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:40,000
What's going on?

1039
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:44,000
NBE-1 haler has lost power.
Backup generator, it just not gonna cut.

1040
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:48,000
Do you have an arms room?

1041
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:59,000
Get everyone to the
NBE-1 chamber now!

1042
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:05,000
They're poppin our generators.

1043
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:28,000
Cryogenic system is failing.
We're loosing NBE1.

1044
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:36,000
I want all Sable rounds
on that table.

1045
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:46,000
You got to take me to my car.

1046
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:48,000
You have to take me to my car,
he's gonna know what to do with The Cube.

1047
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:50,000
Your car, it's confiscated.
- Unconiscate it.

1048
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:52,000
We don't know what will
happen if let him near this thing.

1049
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:54,000
Maybe you know, but I don't.
- You just want to whait here and see what happens?

1050
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:58,000
I have people's lives at stake
here young man!

1051
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:04,000
Drop it.

1052
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:08,000
Drop your weapon soldier.

1053
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:10,000
There's an alien war going on
and you're gonna shoot me?

1054
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:13,000
No we didn't asked to be here.
- I'm oredering you on the S-7 executive juristiction.

1055
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:16,000
S-7 don't exist. - We don't take orders
from people who don't exist.

1056
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:20,000
I'm gonna count to 5.
- I'm gonna count to 3.

1057
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:23,000
Simmons?
- Yes sir?

1058
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:27,000
I'd what he says, loosing
is not an option for these guys.

1059
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:35,000
Allright.

1060
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:38,000
You wanna lay the faith of the
world on the kids camaro...

1061
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:42,000
That's cool.

1062
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:48,000
Stop!

1063
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:51,000
Let him go!

1064
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:55,000
You ok?

1065
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:59,000
They didn't hurt you, right?

1066
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:09,000
Listen to me, The Cube is
here, Decepticons are coming.

1067
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:16,000
Don't worry about them,
they're ok, they're not gonna hurt you.

1068
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:20,000
Just back up a little bit.
He's friendly, he's fine.

1069
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:23,000
Put the guns down,
they're not gonna hurt you.

1070
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:27,000
Come with me, we'll take
you to the Allspark.

1071
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:51,000
Ok, here we go.
He's doing something.

1072
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:18,000
Message from starfleet captain.
Let's get to it.

1073
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:22,000
He's right, if we stay here we're
screwed with Megatron in other hangar.

1074
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:29,000
But we cannot make a stand
without the airforce.

1075
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:31,000
This place must have some
kind of radio link...

1076
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:34,000
Yes. - Short waves...
Right.

1077
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:36,000
Sir you gotta figure out some way
to get the word out in the open.

1078
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:40,000
You need alien archives sir.
Old army radio constant.

1079
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:43,000
Will it work?
- It's possible...

1080
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:46,000
We're set, get in the car!
Mr. secretary, get our broads in the air

1081
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:50,000
when we get to the city
we're gonna find a radio on a F spectre, ok?

1082
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:10,000
Set up perimeter arround
the yellow sealed door!

1083
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:26,000
I am Megatron!

1084
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:04,000
I live to serve you Lord Megatron.
- Where is The Cube?

1085
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:08,000
The humans have taken it.

1086
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:14,000
You fail me yet again
Starscream. Get them!

1087
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:20,000
Over here sir.

1088
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:31,000
We're hot, we're alive!
- Where are the mics?

1089
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:35,000
Mics? - It doens't
work without the mics.

1090
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:37,000
Let's find them.

1091
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:41,000
Get in the chair.

1092
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:44,000
How do we get the signal out?
How do we call the airforce?!

1093
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:48,000
Glenn, can you hotwire this
computer to transmit a tone through the radio?

1094
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:53,000
What good is that? - Morse code,
you can use this to transmit it through that.

1095
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:56,000
Ok I'll do it.
Turn arround.

1096
01:45:56,000 --> 01:46:00,000
Simmons I need a screwdriver!

1097
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:13,000
There's Optimus.

1098
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:31,000
Allmost done.

1099
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:35,000
What the hell was that?

1100
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:40,000
Barricade the door.

1101
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:55,000
Here, put some rounds in it.

1102
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:02,000
I got it, we're transmitting!
- Send exactly what I say!

1103
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:09,000
Defence secretary Keller...

1104
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:16,000
What was that? - Authenticate
emergency action, blackbird 1195...

1105
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:22,000
Sir I have authenticated air strike
order from Sector.

1106
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:47,000
No, no, no!
- What?

1107
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:51,000
Same cop.

1108
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:44,000
Cool mom!

1109
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:11,000
This is so not good.

1110
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:31,000
He's behind the pillar.

1111
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:36,000
Shoot that mother...

1112
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:40,000
Maggie cover fire!

1113
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:44,000
The air force!
They're responding!

1114
01:49:56,000 --> 01:50:00,000
Yes, they're sending F22's
to the scene!

1115
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:25,000
Here, I've got short wave radios.

1116
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:29,000
What am I supposed to do with these?
- Use the, that's all we got.

1117
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:34,000
This is like dinosaur radio, man.
I'm only gonna get 20-30 miles out of this thing.

1118
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:40,000
Are there any aircraft
orbiting the city?

1119
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:41,000
F22 12 o'clock.

1120
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:44,000
I want planes for air cover
and get black hawks on station

1121
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:48,000
to extract that cube, got it?

1122
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:51,000
Air force has arrived, pop smoke!

1123
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:54,000
Raptor do you copy?

1124
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:57,000
We have you on visual.

1125
01:50:57,000 --> 01:51:01,000
Green smoke is the mark. Provide air cover
and vector black hawks for extraction.

1126
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:08,000
It's Starscream!

1127
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:10,000
Please tell me you copy.

1128
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:14,000
Back up!

1129
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:21,000
Back up!
- Fall back!

1130
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:25,000
Incoming!

1131
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:51,000
Anybody hurt?!
Everyone ok?!

1132
01:51:57,000 --> 01:52:01,000
Bumblebee...

1133
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:09,000
You allright?

1134
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:13,000
Please God...
Bumblebee get up!

1135
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:18,000
What the hell was that?!
What are you talking about?!

1136
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:19,000
What do you mean what
am I talking abut?!

1137
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:21,000
They shot at us!
- F22 pilots will never fly

1138
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:24,000
below buildings.
That's alien, that ain't friendly.

1139
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:28,000
You gotta get up.
You're ok.

1140
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:33,000
Black Hawk inbound
to your location, over.

1141
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:37,000
A 273 10 miles.
NW 1,2 cliclks north.

1142
01:52:55,000 --> 01:52:59,000
Move out, let's go!

1143
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:15,000
I'm not gonna leave you.

1144
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:56,000
Come on Decepticon punk!

1145
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:18,000
Concentrate you fire!

1146
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:40,000
It's Megatron retreat!
Pull back!

1147
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:47,000
Pull back!

1148
01:54:55,000 --> 01:54:59,000
We need air cover now!

1149
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:07,000
Sam help me with this.

1150
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:13,000
Come here you little creepner.

1151
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:16,000
You wanna piece of me?!
You wanna piece?!

1152
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:20,000
No, I want 2!

1153
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:23,000
What's going on?

1154
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:26,000
Sir, that tank thing is
getting back up!

1155
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:30,000
These things just don't die.

1156
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:39,000
Where's The Cube?
- Right there.

1157
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:41,000
You got to wrap it arround
the base and his neck.

1158
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:45,000
Epps get those black hawks here.
That building.

1159
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:55,000
I gotta go meet my guys back there,
so here take this flare.

1160
01:55:55,000 --> 01:55:57,000
There's a tall white building
with statues on top

1161
01:55:57,000 --> 01:56:00,000
go to the roof, set the flare,
signal the chopper.

1162
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:04,000
I can't do it!
- Listen to me, you're a soldier now!

1163
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:07,000
I need you to take this cube get
it into military hands while we hold them off.

1164
01:56:07,000 --> 01:56:09,000
Or alot of people are gonna die.

1165
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:12,000
You got to go.
You need to go.

1166
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:16,000
I'm not leaving until I get
Bumblebee out of here.

1167
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:20,000
Black hawk, requesting emediate
evac, civilian boy precious cargo.

1168
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:23,000
headed to rooftop marked by flare.

1169
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:27,000
Sam we will protect you.
- Ok.

1170
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:34,000
Sam...

1171
01:56:35,000 --> 01:56:39,000
No matter what happens, I'm
really glad I got in that car with you.

1172
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:46,000
Sam get to the building!
- Move!

1173
01:56:59,000 --> 01:57:03,000
Watch out!

1174
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:09,000
Girl get that tow truck out of here!
- I'm going!

1175
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:13,000
Get outta here now!

1176
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:43,000
Megatron!
- Prime!

1177
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:09,000
Humans don't deserve to live.
- They deserve to choose for themselves.

1178
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:15,000
You will die with them!

1179
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:23,000
Join them in extinction!

1180
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:44,000
Keep moving Sam.

1181
01:59:17,000 --> 01:59:21,000
Sam get to the building!

1182
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:30,000
Give me that cube boy!

1183
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:44,000
That jerk just demped my car.

1184
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:16,000
I smell you boy!

1185
02:01:09,000 --> 02:01:13,000
I'll drive, you shoot!

1186
02:01:31,000 --> 02:01:35,000
This isn't going well.
- Shoot!

1187
02:02:19,000 --> 02:02:21,000
Nice shot.

1188
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:25,000
Ok he's definitively dead now.
- Let's go, we've got business.

1189
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:04,000
Watch out!

1190
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:18,000
Hang on Sam!

1191
02:03:31,000 --> 02:03:35,000
Is it fear or courage that
compeles you fleshling?

1192
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:56,000
Give me the Allspark and
you may live to be my pet.

1193
02:04:03,000 --> 02:04:06,000
I'm never giving you this Allspark.

1194
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:10,000
Oh so wise.

1195
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:24,000
I got you boy.

1196
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:28,000
Hold on to The Cube.

1197
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:56,000
Sam...

1198
02:04:57,000 --> 02:05:01,000
You risked your life to
protect The Cube.

1199
02:05:01,000 --> 02:05:04,000
No sacrifice...

1200
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:07,000
No victory.
- If I cannot defeat Megatron...

1201
02:05:07,000 --> 02:05:10,000
You must push The Cube into my chest.

1202
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:14,000
I will sacrifice myself
to destroy it.

1203
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:17,000
Get behind me.

1204
02:05:17,000 --> 02:05:21,000
It's you and me Megatron.
- No, it's just me Prime.

1205
02:05:25,000 --> 02:05:29,000
At the end of this day,
one shall stand, one shall fall.

1206
02:05:35,000 --> 02:05:39,000
You still fight for the weak,
that is why you lose.

1207
02:05:59,000 --> 02:06:01,000
Fighters in 60 seconds.

1208
02:06:01,000 --> 02:06:05,000
We got friendlies mixed with
bad guys, targets will be marked.

1209
02:06:05,000 --> 02:06:08,000
Bring the rain.

1210
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:12,000
Let's kill these things.

1211
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:30,000
Target marked, still waiting.
- Coming on target, 20 seconds.

1212
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:40,000
That's 22 so stay away.

1213
02:06:43,000 --> 02:06:47,000
Move out!

1214
02:07:53,000 --> 02:07:57,000
Take them out!

1215
02:08:25,000 --> 02:08:29,000
Sam put The Cube in my chest now!

1216
02:08:57,000 --> 02:09:01,000
Hold up.

1217
02:09:01,000 --> 02:09:05,000
You left me no choice brother.

1218
02:09:14,000 --> 02:09:18,000
Sam I owe you my life.

1219
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:22,000
We are in your debt.

1220
02:09:38,000 --> 02:09:42,000
Prime, we couldn't save him.
- Oh Jazz...

1221
02:09:46,000 --> 02:09:49,000
We lost a great comrade.

1222
02:09:49,000 --> 02:09:53,000
But gained new ones, thank you, all of you.

1223
02:09:54,000 --> 02:09:58,000
You honor us with your bravery.

1224
02:09:58,000 --> 02:10:00,000
Permission to speak sir.

1225
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:04,000
Permission granted, old friend.
- You speak now?

1226
02:10:05,000 --> 02:10:08,000
I wish to stay with the boy.

1227
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:12,000
If that is his choice.

1228
02:10:15,000 --> 02:10:19,000
Yes.

1229
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:40,000
Gentlemen, the president has
ordered sector 7

1230
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:44,000
be terminated, and the remains
of the dead aliens

1231
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:46,000
disposed of.

1232
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:50,000
Marionas Abiss, is 7 miles below
sea level, deepest place on our planet.

1233
02:10:51,000 --> 02:10:55,000
Massive depth and pressure there,
coupled with subfreezing temperatures

1234
02:10:55,000 --> 02:10:59,000
will crush them.

1235
02:10:59,000 --> 02:11:03,000
Leaving no evidence.

1236
02:11:06,000 --> 02:11:10,000
With the Allspark gone,
we cannot return life to our planet.

1237
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:16,000
And faith has yielded it's reward.

1238
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:20,000
A new world to call home.

1239
02:11:25,000 --> 02:11:29,000
We live among it's people now,
hiding in plane sight.

1240
02:11:30,000 --> 02:11:33,000
But watching over them in secret.

1241
02:11:33,000 --> 02:11:36,000
Waiting...
Protecting...

1242
02:11:36,000 --> 02:11:40,000
I have witnessed their
capacity for courage.

1243
02:11:40,000 --> 02:11:44,000
And though we are worlds apart,
like us, there's more to them than meets the eye.

1244
02:11:50,000 --> 02:11:54,000
I am Optimus Prime, and I send
this message to any surviving Autobots

1245
02:11:56,000 --> 02:12:00,000
taking refuge among the stars.

1246
02:12:00,000 --> 02:12:02,000
We are here...

1247
02:12:02,000 --> 02:12:06,000
We are waiting...

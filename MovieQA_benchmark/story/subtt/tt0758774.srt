1
00:00:29,786 --> 00:00:36,574


2
00:01:30,808 --> 00:01:32,369
All clear.

3
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,850
Shh.

4
00:02:13,015 --> 00:02:14,356
Ali.

5
00:03:29,523 --> 00:03:32,306
Do we belong there? Do we not?

6
00:03:33,108 --> 00:03:35,115
It doesn't matter
how you would answer that...

7
00:03:35,284 --> 00:03:39,439
...because we are there.
We're tired, and we can't see the end.

8
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:44,078
We can't even console ourselves
that our enemy is just as tired as we are.

9
00:03:44,852 --> 00:03:46,280
Because they're not.

10
00:03:49,172 --> 00:03:54,834
It is a fallacy that prolonged war
will weaken an occupied enemy.

11
00:03:54,997 --> 00:03:55,978
He's dead.

12
00:03:56,147 --> 00:03:59,345
It most likely
will make your enemy stronger.

13
00:03:59,507 --> 00:04:02,921
They get used to the deprivation,
and they adapt and respond accordingly.

14
00:04:04,562 --> 00:04:06,188
While here at home...

15
00:04:06,355 --> 00:04:10,578
The explosion occurred in one of
Manchester's heavily Asian neighborhoods.

16
00:04:10,738 --> 00:04:12,266
...with every death reported...

17
00:04:12,435 --> 00:04:16,560
...we have to deal with a public-opinion
trajectory that slides rapidly...

18
00:04:16,723 --> 00:04:20,401
...from supportive to negative
to downright hostile.

19
00:04:21,011 --> 00:04:24,905
People just get sick and tired
of a moment's silence at a ball game.

20
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:27,625
They just wanna be told that it's over.

21
00:04:27,794 --> 00:04:30,162
Police and emergency
workers in Manchester...

22
00:04:30,322 --> 00:04:33,071
...are still combing through what is left
of this block of flats.

23
00:04:33,234 --> 00:04:34,761
They say this was not the target.

24
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:38,408
Had the bombs being constructed here
found their eventual intended target...

25
00:04:38,576 --> 00:04:39,723
...the devastation could...

26
00:04:39,888 --> 00:04:41,481
Despite the fact...

27
00:04:41,648 --> 00:04:44,551
...we have markedly increased
our operational intensity...

28
00:04:45,296 --> 00:04:47,120
...we're not seeing any progress.

29
00:04:48,145 --> 00:04:50,001
What we're dealing with here...

30
00:04:50,162 --> 00:04:53,259
...is potentially a global conflagration...

31
00:04:53,426 --> 00:04:57,070
...that requires constant diligence
in order to suppress.

32
00:04:58,481 --> 00:05:00,389
Now, you see...

33
00:05:00,914 --> 00:05:03,814
...because our enemy...

34
00:05:03,986 --> 00:05:08,774
...has realized that they are fighting guys
from the future.

35
00:05:09,616 --> 00:05:14,089
Now, ahem, it is brilliant
as it is infuriating.

36
00:05:14,256 --> 00:05:18,533
If you live like it's the past,
and you behave like it's the past...

37
00:05:18,703 --> 00:05:21,900
...then guys from the future
find it very hard to see you.

38
00:05:22,063 --> 00:05:25,445
If you throw away your cell phone,
shut down your e-mail...

39
00:05:25,614 --> 00:05:29,510
...pass all your instructions face-to-face,
hand-to-hand...

40
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,811
...turn your back on technology
and just disappear into the crowd...

41
00:05:32,974 --> 00:05:35,693
No flags. No uniforms.

42
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:38,857
You got your basic grunts
on the ground there.

43
00:05:39,024 --> 00:05:41,260
They're looking going,
"Who is it we're fighting?"

44
00:05:41,423 --> 00:05:45,862
In a situation like this,
your friends dress just like your enemies...

45
00:05:46,031 --> 00:05:48,419
...and your enemies dress
like your friends.

46
00:05:48,974 --> 00:05:53,579
What I need you to fully understand is that
these people, they do not wanna negotiate.

47
00:05:53,742 --> 00:05:55,170
Not at all.

48
00:05:55,343 --> 00:05:59,400
They want the universal caliphate
established across the face of the Earth...

49
00:06:00,685 --> 00:06:04,908
...and they want every infidel converted
or dead.

50
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:09,736
So, what's changed...

51
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:13,357
...is that our
allegedly unsophisticated enemy...

52
00:06:13,517 --> 00:06:16,715
...has cottoned on
to the factually unsophisticated truth...

53
00:06:16,878 --> 00:06:18,154
...we're an easy target.

54
00:06:18,318 --> 00:06:20,936
We are an easy target...

55
00:06:21,102 --> 00:06:24,483
...and our world as we know it
is a lot simpler...

56
00:06:24,653 --> 00:06:27,619
...to put to an end than you might think.

57
00:06:28,429 --> 00:06:31,691
We take our foot off the throat
of this enemy for one minute...

58
00:06:31,852 --> 00:06:34,024
...and our world changes completely.

59
00:06:34,189 --> 00:06:35,977
Thank you, Mr. Hoffman.

60
00:06:47,724 --> 00:06:48,935
BASSAM

61
00:06:49,515 --> 00:06:51,109
I'm coming.

62
00:06:57,451 --> 00:06:59,013
You're early.

63
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:01,387
Big boss man, what's happening?

64
00:07:04,043 --> 00:07:05,670
What's the story?

65
00:07:05,837 --> 00:07:07,079
Rules of the day.

66
00:07:07,245 --> 00:07:09,415
If the car gets immobilized,
start shooting.

67
00:07:09,579 --> 00:07:11,652
Nobody gets traded. Everybody dies.

68
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:13,510
So same as every day?

69
00:07:13,674 --> 00:07:16,392
- You got it. Want some breakfast?
- Hell, yes.

70
00:07:17,355 --> 00:07:18,336
Thanks.

71
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:20,968
All right. Tell me something real.

72
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:23,717
Oh, all I got is real, man. You know me.

73
00:07:23,883 --> 00:07:25,059
All right, let's hear it.

74
00:07:25,228 --> 00:07:28,676
All right, a guy named Nizar.

75
00:07:28,843 --> 00:07:30,949
He's from Aquiz up near Tikrit, right?

76
00:07:31,114 --> 00:07:34,430
So he gets all fucked in his head
after the invasion, you know?

77
00:07:34,602 --> 00:07:37,123
He starts working with the Baathists,
then the jihadists.

78
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:40,290
But he is scared shitless now, man.

79
00:07:40,458 --> 00:07:42,759
He's supposed
to do a martyrdom operation...

80
00:07:42,921 --> 00:07:44,896
...but he doesn't wanna fucking die.

81
00:07:45,067 --> 00:07:47,106
So he's coming to us.

82
00:07:47,274 --> 00:07:48,582
- He's coming to us?
- Mm-hm.

83
00:07:50,025 --> 00:07:51,586
For chrissakes, move the donkey.

84
00:07:53,544 --> 00:07:56,262
Move it, let's go.
Get these guys moving. Let's go.

85
00:07:56,426 --> 00:07:58,661
Come on, come on.

86
00:07:58,827 --> 00:08:01,444
Oh, my God. Just get the...
Buy the fucking flowers.

87
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:05,639
Come on, come on.

88
00:08:05,801 --> 00:08:08,451
So, what are the chances
your man's playing both sides?

89
00:08:08,618 --> 00:08:10,658
I don't know. What are they with me?

90
00:08:10,826 --> 00:08:12,713
Three to one.

91
00:08:12,873 --> 00:08:14,184
All right. Let's slow down.

92
00:08:14,344 --> 00:08:15,753
Is this it?

93
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:18,911
Yeah. This is it.

94
00:08:19,082 --> 00:08:22,015
Nitrate 37 slewing to target ports now.

95
00:08:22,184 --> 00:08:23,645
01 L2MDT.

96
00:08:23,816 --> 00:08:25,857
On target, 15:31 Zulu.

97
00:08:26,026 --> 00:08:27,879
Cell phone linked to moving vehicle.

98
00:08:28,039 --> 00:08:29,632
Stop right up here.

99
00:08:29,801 --> 00:08:32,965
Right up here. Let me take a look.

100
00:08:36,041 --> 00:08:38,560
- I don't see anything.
I'm gonna call him.

101
00:08:38,727 --> 00:08:40,517
All right, call him.

102
00:08:44,935 --> 00:08:45,918
Bassam.

103
00:08:46,087 --> 00:08:47,646
Yeah, Nizar.

104
00:08:51,016 --> 00:08:51,998
NIZAR:

105
00:08:52,167 --> 00:08:53,280
Huh?

106
00:08:53,448 --> 00:08:55,075
NIZAR:

107
00:08:55,238 --> 00:08:56,353
IR 3.9.

108
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:59,902
- He says he wants one of us to come in.
He is to meet inside the car.

109
00:09:00,071 --> 00:09:02,460
Inside the car.
If he wants to talk, it's in the car.

110
00:09:02,631 --> 00:09:05,216
You have to come to us, Nizar.

111
00:09:05,383 --> 00:09:07,870
- I'm coming to you.
- Do the fuck what I said. Go.

112
00:09:08,934 --> 00:09:10,692
Hey, hey. Listen to me.

113
00:09:10,855 --> 00:09:13,024
I am not getting my head cut off
on the Internet.

114
00:09:13,192 --> 00:09:14,598
If something happens, shoot me.

115
00:09:14,759 --> 00:09:17,792
- Will you shoot me?
- Fuck that shit. I will shoot you right now.

116
00:09:17,957 --> 00:09:20,064
- I'm not kidding.
- Quit being a pussy.

117
00:09:24,068 --> 00:09:25,215
Nizar.

118
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:28,956
Zooming in.

119
00:09:29,125 --> 00:09:30,619
Visual confirmed.

120
00:09:31,301 --> 00:09:33,123
Long wave 10.7.

121
00:09:42,086 --> 00:09:43,231
Shit.

122
00:09:43,397 --> 00:09:46,244
- I can't talk right now, Larry.
- She wants the house.

123
00:09:46,405 --> 00:09:48,894
Give her the house.
It's a piece of shit, all right?

124
00:09:49,061 --> 00:09:51,135
- We're getting this, sir.
- We're getting it.

125
00:09:51,302 --> 00:09:53,985
She can ask for whatever she wants,
but I'm not listening.

126
00:09:54,149 --> 00:09:56,538
What the hell are you calling for?
Hang up the phone.

127
00:09:56,709 --> 00:09:58,114
Hang up the phone.

128
00:10:00,101 --> 00:10:01,529
Are you on the line?

129
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:04,286
I can see you now, all right?
You are attracting attention.

130
00:10:04,452 --> 00:10:07,683
Get the fuck out of here right now.
I will handle this on my own.

131
00:10:07,846 --> 00:10:09,022
Roger that. Off target.

132
00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:12,284
Copy. Off target, 3-10.

133
00:10:16,932 --> 00:10:18,077
FERRIS

134
00:10:18,723 --> 00:10:19,805
Yes.

135
00:10:19,971 --> 00:10:21,313
Good, good, good.

136
00:10:24,259 --> 00:10:27,424
You want an orange? You hungry?

137
00:10:27,588 --> 00:10:28,667
No.

138
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:34,435
So, Nizar...

139
00:10:34,596 --> 00:10:36,319
...why'd you come to me, huh?

140
00:10:36,866 --> 00:10:38,756
I know too many things.

141
00:10:40,196 --> 00:10:42,683
They prepared me to go outside Iraq.

142
00:10:43,938 --> 00:10:46,558
What do you mean by "outside Iraq"?

143
00:10:46,723 --> 00:10:49,952
They said they need me
to become shahid...

144
00:10:50,115 --> 00:10:52,056
...for martyrdom.

145
00:10:52,227 --> 00:10:55,543
When a man knows too much,
they say martyrdom.

146
00:10:55,715 --> 00:10:59,358
Who do you mean by "they," Nizar? Hm?

147
00:11:04,898 --> 00:11:07,005
I don't want to die.

148
00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:11,229
I want to go to America.

149
00:11:12,001 --> 00:11:14,106
I have a Ph. D., you know?

150
00:11:14,273 --> 00:11:17,023
And they want me...
They want me to blow myself up.

151
00:11:17,505 --> 00:11:20,188
- Ph. D. In what, chemistry?
- No.

152
00:11:20,353 --> 00:11:22,425
What do you know
about radiological materials?

153
00:11:22,593 --> 00:11:25,561
Linguistic. I speak five languages.
Five, you know?

154
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:27,770
Nobody should say "martyr" to me.
Nobody.

155
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:30,425
- You are a rare and a delicate flower.
- Yes, I am.

156
00:11:30,593 --> 00:11:31,574
- Yes.
- Yes.

157
00:11:31,745 --> 00:11:34,461
So you don't wanna kill the Jews
and the Crusaders, huh?

158
00:11:35,968 --> 00:11:37,692
What do you know about our pain?

159
00:11:38,721 --> 00:11:40,214
Cut the bullshit, all right?

160
00:11:40,384 --> 00:11:42,391
Give me some information.
What do you know?

161
00:11:47,776 --> 00:11:50,776
You know,
I know enough to be martyred.

162
00:11:50,944 --> 00:11:54,105
But with you,
I know enough to stay alive.

163
00:11:59,712 --> 00:12:01,654
You have a computer?

164
00:12:18,623 --> 00:12:20,566
- Yup.
Hey, Ed, it's me.

165
00:12:20,735 --> 00:12:23,419
I got an Iraqi walk-in, up near Samarra.

166
00:12:23,583 --> 00:12:27,128
He's got a communiqué video here that
somebody walked across the Iranian border.

167
00:12:27,296 --> 00:12:29,050
I'm watching it right now, sir.

168
00:12:29,663 --> 00:12:31,670
- Can you see his face?
- Yes, captain.

169
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:33,694
I am looking at the white whale.

170
00:12:34,142 --> 00:12:36,379
- It is Al-Saleem.
- What's he saying?

171
00:12:36,543 --> 00:12:37,752
Well, it's gotta be current.

172
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,089
He mentions the Sheffield bus bombings
a week ago.

173
00:12:40,255 --> 00:12:43,800
He's telling the brothers to prepare for
a UK operation's already planned...

174
00:12:43,967 --> 00:12:47,349
...which is the bombing these people
fucked up in Manchester this morning.

175
00:12:47,775 --> 00:12:50,294
Let me translate this part
for you directly.

176
00:12:53,213 --> 00:12:57,076
"We will avenge the America wars
on the Muslim world.

177
00:12:58,815 --> 00:13:01,049
We will come at them everywhere.

178
00:13:01,661 --> 00:13:06,396
We will strike at random, across Europe,
then America, continually.

179
00:13:06,558 --> 00:13:08,347
We have bled.

180
00:13:08,509 --> 00:13:12,152
Now they will bleed. And bleed.

181
00:13:12,733 --> 00:13:14,554
Until they are bled out. "

182
00:13:16,732 --> 00:13:18,141
Ed.

183
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:20,787
It's 6:00 in the morning.

184
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:22,615
Saving civilization, honey.

185
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:24,504
Disks are passed from hand to hand.

186
00:13:24,668 --> 00:13:27,124
The communiqués are not transmitted,
not copied.

187
00:13:27,292 --> 00:13:30,610
My man says that real orders
are verbal or in code on paper.

188
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:32,819
Is there any indication of where he is?

189
00:13:32,988 --> 00:13:36,304
No, sir.
He definitely does not have his location.

190
00:13:36,764 --> 00:13:39,698
But he did mention there's a safe house
up north, near Balad...

191
00:13:39,869 --> 00:13:41,395
...where Al-Saleem may have been.

192
00:13:41,564 --> 00:13:43,123
Dad?

193
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:44,569
Hey.

194
00:13:44,731 --> 00:13:47,580
They're killing anyone who
knows anything. He's scared.

195
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:50,106
We need to debrief him very carefully.

196
00:13:50,267 --> 00:13:52,635
- All right, so do it.
- In the States.

197
00:13:52,795 --> 00:13:54,072
No. Ahem.

198
00:13:54,236 --> 00:13:56,656
They're onto him.
That's the reason he's running.

199
00:13:56,826 --> 00:13:59,064
- On the toilet, not the floor.
- You hear me, right?

200
00:13:59,226 --> 00:14:01,617
So he wants to come to America
in one piece...

201
00:14:01,788 --> 00:14:03,893
...instead of going to paradise
in a thousand.

202
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:05,782
He should've thought of that before.

203
00:14:05,947 --> 00:14:09,329
I'm telling you.
They will kill him within a few days, Ed.

204
00:14:09,499 --> 00:14:11,954
Yep. And if they do,
that's all right...

205
00:14:12,122 --> 00:14:14,577
...because we can be there
to see who pulls the trigger.

206
00:14:14,747 --> 00:14:16,951
Now, get back to bed. Good night.

207
00:14:17,114 --> 00:14:20,626
- Am I missing the point?
- I just offered him asylum.

208
00:14:20,794 --> 00:14:22,388
Well, you lied, buddy.

209
00:14:23,163 --> 00:14:26,261
So just cut him loose...

210
00:14:26,425 --> 00:14:28,630
...and put him back on the street.

211
00:14:29,306 --> 00:14:30,288
All right.

212
00:14:38,298 --> 00:14:41,014
Okay, so everything's fine.
No, no, no problem. No problem.

213
00:14:41,178 --> 00:14:45,106
We just have to ask you a few more
questions, and then we can go.

214
00:14:45,274 --> 00:14:47,444
No, no more questions.
Take me to the Green Zone.

215
00:14:47,608 --> 00:14:50,807
Maybe we could help. We have a few
questions. Everything will be fine.

216
00:14:50,968 --> 00:14:53,872
Trust me. Okay? It's okay. Sit down.

217
00:14:55,737 --> 00:14:58,127
You're a liar. You're a liar.
You fucking d...

218
00:14:58,297 --> 00:15:00,850
Get on the fucking...
Back the fuck up! Step back!

219
00:15:01,017 --> 00:15:03,831
I talk to you! I talk to you!
And that's all you want!

220
00:15:03,992 --> 00:15:07,342
- You want to see who kills me, huh?
- Bassam. Search him. Get his phone.

221
00:15:08,727 --> 00:15:11,346
Now you've seen our faces.
You know what that means.

222
00:15:11,512 --> 00:15:12,495
Computer.

223
00:15:12,663 --> 00:15:14,999
Guantanamo?
You threaten me with Guantanamo?

224
00:15:15,161 --> 00:15:17,048
If you don't do exactly
what I say...

225
00:15:17,210 --> 00:15:19,509
...I will execute you right here.
Do you understand?

226
00:15:20,504 --> 00:15:24,279
Listen, we are your friends, okay?
We're your friends.

227
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,862
We're here to watch you.
We're here to protect you.

228
00:15:27,384 --> 00:15:29,108
You can't even protect yourselves.

229
00:15:39,447 --> 00:15:41,487
Boss?
Yeah, I'm right here.

230
00:15:41,656 --> 00:15:43,247
I got a visual on him.

231
00:15:43,415 --> 00:15:45,389
Okay, where's he coming from?

232
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:47,533
He's riding up right now.
Coming right to us.

233
00:15:47,702 --> 00:15:49,645
Yes. I see him. I see him.

234
00:15:49,815 --> 00:15:52,718
He's coming down the street.
He's coming north towards the square.

235
00:15:52,887 --> 00:15:56,050
-I'm gonna hang back.
-All right,I'll let you know what he's doing.

236
00:15:56,214 --> 00:15:59,028
Keep an eye on him for me.
He stopped in front of the café.

237
00:15:59,189 --> 00:16:00,816
He's walking right up.

238
00:16:02,614 --> 00:16:04,555
- Listen, Bassam?
- Yeah?

239
00:16:04,727 --> 00:16:10,509
There is a black van heading this way
with some pretty dangerous-looking guys.

240
00:16:10,678 --> 00:16:14,094
- They're staring right at him.
Yeah, I see it.

241
00:16:14,262 --> 00:16:16,530
Tell me what it does.
All right.

242
00:16:16,694 --> 00:16:20,436
Looks like it's parking right up ahead.
Yeah, it stopped. The van stopped.

243
00:16:20,597 --> 00:16:21,742
Can I turn around?

244
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:24,014
Yeah, yeah, Nizar's getting
on his bike.

245
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:26,734
There's like four or five guys
getting out of that van.

246
00:16:26,901 --> 00:16:30,219
Can you identify any of these guys?
- I've never seen these guys before.

247
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:31,371
We gotta move.

248
00:16:49,749 --> 00:16:51,209
Did you see a flash?
What?

249
00:16:51,668 --> 00:16:52,944
Did somebody get hit?

250
00:16:53,109 --> 00:16:55,662
Let's see a playback on that.
Stay with him.

251
00:16:57,460 --> 00:17:00,559
Hello.
-In case you didn't see it,I executed him.

252
00:17:00,724 --> 00:17:01,935
You did what you had to do.

253
00:17:02,099 --> 00:17:06,093
If you hadn't, he would be describing you
down to your eyebrows to them right now.

254
00:17:06,261 --> 00:17:08,464
I did it, all right? It's done.
I killed him.

255
00:17:08,627 --> 00:17:10,960
He was always gonna get killed
no matter what he did.

256
00:17:11,125 --> 00:17:13,457
Besides, you'd milked him
and he was dry.

257
00:17:13,621 --> 00:17:15,311
Excuse me.

258
00:17:16,243 --> 00:17:17,553
Ferris?

259
00:17:17,716 --> 00:17:19,537
Is your silence supposed
to say something?

260
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:21,871
Because you do know we're at war, right?

261
00:17:22,034 --> 00:17:25,832
Your friend, who you must have had some
intense cross-cultural eye contact with...

262
00:17:26,002 --> 00:17:28,850
...was a terrorist a-hole,
who turned out to be a coward...

263
00:17:29,012 --> 00:17:30,602
...who wanted to go to Disneyland.

264
00:17:30,769 --> 00:17:33,934
Listen, Ed, we're going north now,
do you hear me?

265
00:17:34,099 --> 00:17:37,742
-We're going north to the Balad safe house.
-No, no, no, buddy. No, you're not.

266
00:17:37,908 --> 00:17:39,532
You're blown. There's chatter.

267
00:17:39,699 --> 00:17:42,698
Well, if I'm blown, Ed, that means
you should've sent a team here...

268
00:17:42,867 --> 00:17:46,761
...the minute Nizar got shot,
but you didn't send a team, did you?

269
00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:49,036
Well, not since we've
been talking, Ferris.

270
00:17:49,203 --> 00:17:52,136
You and I, we're going to that
safe house, you understand? Now.

271
00:17:52,305 --> 00:17:53,997
- Ferris?
- Where's the goddamn car, huh?

272
00:17:54,163 --> 00:17:55,143
Let's get out of here.

273
00:18:24,305 --> 00:18:27,271
It's time to move.
I'm coming back to you, all right?

274
00:18:29,904 --> 00:18:32,010
If something happens,
you'll shoot me, right?

275
00:18:32,177 --> 00:18:34,412
- Yep.
- Good.

276
00:19:17,998 --> 00:19:19,427
Got you.

277
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,093
Don't you fucking do it.

278
00:19:22,702 --> 00:19:24,165
Hassan! Hassan!

279
00:19:33,486 --> 00:19:38,243
Urgent request you dispatch Chili,
Speck or Nitrate to these coordinates.

280
00:19:46,541 --> 00:19:49,836
North, 34 degrees, 20 minutes,
16.8 seconds.

281
00:19:49,996 --> 00:19:53,194
East, 44 degrees, 24 minutes,
14.4 seconds.

282
00:19:53,357 --> 00:19:56,935
This is a live target, a known
operational base of an Al-Saleem cell.

283
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:59,556
- A high-value target.
Copy that, on approach.

284
00:20:21,772 --> 00:20:23,877
Aah! Get back!

285
00:20:33,932 --> 00:20:35,752
Come on!

286
00:20:35,915 --> 00:20:38,730
- Gotta go! Gotta go!
I'm getting the intel!

287
00:20:40,010 --> 00:20:44,353
Get in the fucking car, man!
Come on! Come on!

288
00:20:49,738 --> 00:20:51,300
Go! Go!

289
00:21:00,266 --> 00:21:03,049
I've got guys coming down
the hill! Two trucks! On the right!

290
00:21:03,211 --> 00:21:04,737
I got it.

291
00:21:05,515 --> 00:21:06,529
Keep moving!

292
00:21:30,729 --> 00:21:31,712
Fuck.

293
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:34,499
We're in some serious
fucking trouble here.

294
00:21:34,666 --> 00:21:38,112
We're on Highway 1, south of Samarra.
We're being pursued by two vehicles.

295
00:21:38,281 --> 00:21:40,868
We have valuable intel
in our possession!

296
00:21:41,032 --> 00:21:43,749
We're in a black Nissan.
Where the fuck are you people?

297
00:21:43,914 --> 00:21:46,300
- I see them!
We're right on their six.

298
00:21:48,999 --> 00:21:51,587
- Have visual, will engage.
Copy that. Engage at will.

299
00:22:04,008 --> 00:22:05,949
RPG. Take them out now.

300
00:22:11,719 --> 00:22:13,126
Fire!

301
00:22:13,287 --> 00:22:14,696
RPG!

302
00:22:18,216 --> 00:22:19,808
Nine, one, two, six, one.

303
00:22:26,695 --> 00:22:28,384
Let's go!

304
00:22:30,086 --> 00:22:32,705
- Fuel tank is ruptured!
I got him! Get the driver out!

305
00:22:32,872 --> 00:22:35,839
I can't! He's in pieces!
Then get the bag! Get the intel!

306
00:22:36,870 --> 00:22:38,243
Bassam! Bassam!

307
00:22:38,887 --> 00:22:41,734
Stay with them. We are tracking.

308
00:22:43,078 --> 00:22:44,868
- Bassam!
Get his legs!

309
00:22:45,670 --> 00:22:48,606
No!
Intel secure!

310
00:22:48,774 --> 00:22:50,463
Let's go! Stay down.

311
00:22:51,396 --> 00:22:52,609
Come on, buddy.

312
00:22:53,157 --> 00:22:55,046
Come on. Get him out, now!

313
00:23:09,636 --> 00:23:11,327
He's dead.

314
00:23:15,524 --> 00:23:16,867
Who are you?

315
00:23:17,028 --> 00:23:18,109
What's your name?

316
00:23:18,276 --> 00:23:21,091
Do you know where you are? Come on!

317
00:23:21,894 --> 00:23:23,419
Fuck.

318
00:23:37,284 --> 00:23:38,714
What's that?

319
00:23:38,884 --> 00:23:40,348
Bone fragments.

320
00:23:40,770 --> 00:23:42,366
Not yours.

321
00:23:48,708 --> 00:23:52,024
- They get that stuff I sent out?
- All uploaded to Langley.

322
00:23:52,195 --> 00:23:53,853
Mr. Hoffman.

323
00:23:55,876 --> 00:23:58,177
- Hey, Ed.
Ferris.

324
00:23:58,340 --> 00:24:02,168
-Christmas came early, buddy.
-Oh, yeah? What'd I get for Christmas,Ed?

325
00:24:02,338 --> 00:24:06,115
Well, 15 pages of this,
40 pages of that.

326
00:24:06,274 --> 00:24:10,583
I got, like, about 712 phone numbers
that are new to us...

327
00:24:10,754 --> 00:24:12,511
...that we can strip and evaluate...

328
00:24:12,676 --> 00:24:15,642
...and amongst other things,
a safe house in Amman.

329
00:24:15,811 --> 00:24:18,177
I've got jihadists coming and going
from this place...

330
00:24:18,339 --> 00:24:20,226
...like it's happy hour
at the Cat House.

331
00:24:20,835 --> 00:24:21,946
You gotta see this place.

332
00:24:22,562 --> 00:24:26,590
Before we get into that, I wanna know
what you're doing for Bassam's family, Ed.

333
00:24:26,754 --> 00:24:28,183
I didn't know the man.

334
00:24:28,353 --> 00:24:30,808
What are you doing for Bassam's family?
He was your guy.

335
00:24:30,979 --> 00:24:32,442
So now you don't know him, huh?

336
00:24:33,761 --> 00:24:37,240
You'll be going to Amman
as acting station chief.

337
00:24:37,408 --> 00:24:40,541
You'll outrank Holiday. No matter
what he says, you're the show-runner.

338
00:24:40,706 --> 00:24:44,765
You'll liaise with Jordanian GID,
who are as hot for Al-Saleem as we are.

339
00:24:44,930 --> 00:24:47,099
You'll be working with
a guy named Hani Salaam...

340
00:24:47,266 --> 00:24:49,687
...who is not your run-of-the-mill
fingernail-puller.

341
00:24:49,856 --> 00:24:51,198
Hani is a professional.

342
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,271
And will I be sharing information
with him?

343
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:56,191
Let me say this about that: No.

344
00:24:56,927 --> 00:24:59,929
Now, you wanna take a few weeks off
and go bang the wife?

345
00:25:00,097 --> 00:25:03,644
I'm getting a divorce, Ed. You know that.
You know more about it than I do.

346
00:25:03,809 --> 00:25:06,743
Everybody around here screws up
their marriage, buddy. Why not you?

347
00:25:07,777 --> 00:25:08,922
So you'll go to Amman?

348
00:25:12,127 --> 00:25:15,097
I will go to Amman. I'll call you later.

349
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:56,924
This car is a real pile of shit.
Is this the best they could afford?

350
00:25:57,086 --> 00:26:00,502
I brought this car in case you wanted
to cruise the safe house now, you know?

351
00:26:00,669 --> 00:26:03,932
No one cruises that
safe house, all right?

352
00:26:04,094 --> 00:26:07,129
I need to take a shit, I need a shower
and an Internet connection...

353
00:26:07,296 --> 00:26:09,880
...so just take me to my apartment,
all right?

354
00:26:10,782 --> 00:26:13,116
Got you in a high-rise.

355
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:15,961
Hot and cold water.
And you can drink it.

356
00:26:16,126 --> 00:26:17,784
- Great.
- There's not much local color.

357
00:26:18,335 --> 00:26:20,603
I've had it with the local color.
Thank you.

358
00:26:36,061 --> 00:26:38,134
Cheap-ass motherfuckers.

359
00:26:43,324 --> 00:26:45,082
Morning, sir.

360
00:26:45,725 --> 00:26:46,774
He's clear.

361
00:26:49,277 --> 00:26:51,578
NSA is listening to the phones
and computer links...

362
00:26:51,741 --> 00:26:53,497
...of anyone who's been
near the house.

363
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:57,273
Look, they don't have to be geniuses
to stop using their e-mail and cell phones.

364
00:26:57,435 --> 00:26:59,609
I don't understand why
you haven't figured out...

365
00:26:59,772 --> 00:27:02,490
...that they're not communicating
electronically anymore.

366
00:27:03,644 --> 00:27:05,946
The house is owned
by a family named Alousi.

367
00:27:06,108 --> 00:27:09,304
And in my opinion, it just seems
like a normal Jordanian family...

368
00:27:09,469 --> 00:27:11,092
...with a lot of country relatives.

369
00:27:11,259 --> 00:27:12,569
Normal Jordanian family.

370
00:27:12,730 --> 00:27:18,482
But all of them are unmarried males
between the ages of 18 and 35, correct?

371
00:27:18,652 --> 00:27:20,953
Listen, kid,
whatever information you got in Iraq...

372
00:27:21,115 --> 00:27:24,048
...I just don't think this house
is what you think it is.

373
00:27:24,219 --> 00:27:28,016
These boys drink alcohol, they chase
girls, they smoke hash, and...

374
00:27:28,186 --> 00:27:29,593
So did Mohamed Atta, right?

375
00:27:29,756 --> 00:27:32,024
- It's Takfir methodology.
- Takfir methodology.

376
00:27:32,604 --> 00:27:35,832
Correct. It's permitted in order
to deceive the infidel.

377
00:27:36,282 --> 00:27:39,380
You've had guys watching them
go in and out of this safe house here...

378
00:27:39,548 --> 00:27:40,691
...but what I don't get...

379
00:27:40,858 --> 00:27:43,542
...is why you haven't had anyone
monitoring them after.

380
00:27:43,705 --> 00:27:46,127
Well, there's so much activity
at this location...

381
00:27:46,297 --> 00:27:49,615
...that we have exhausted the station's
indigenous-appearing manpower.

382
00:27:49,787 --> 00:27:52,886
So you don't have enough good Arab guys
to follow the bad Arab guys...

383
00:27:53,050 --> 00:27:54,838
...is what you're saying.
- That's right.

384
00:27:55,002 --> 00:27:57,587
Well, you're gonna need
some more human surveillance...

385
00:27:57,756 --> 00:27:59,826
...loaners from
Jordanian Intelligence.

386
00:28:00,314 --> 00:28:01,425
All right. Skip, get out.

387
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:11,313
Now, I am in receipt of a directive...

388
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:15,888
...which tells me that I am
to make myself useful to you...

389
00:28:16,058 --> 00:28:19,832
...in whichever way
that you request or require.

390
00:28:19,994 --> 00:28:23,791
But it is my feeling that to involve
the Jordanian secret service...

391
00:28:23,959 --> 00:28:26,132
...is a breach of operational integrity.

392
00:28:26,296 --> 00:28:29,428
You don't need to tell me
about Jordanian Intelligence, all right?

393
00:28:29,594 --> 00:28:32,527
They are doing a far superior job
than you are, my friend.

394
00:28:32,695 --> 00:28:34,257
You've read that directive there...

395
00:28:34,423 --> 00:28:37,174
...which clearly states that I am in charge
of this operation.

396
00:28:37,337 --> 00:28:40,206
So, what I need you to do
is leave this office immediately...

397
00:28:40,377 --> 00:28:42,229
...and hand your entire
staff over to me.

398
00:28:44,984 --> 00:28:49,009
You know, we've all watched your rise
in the Near East Division.

399
00:28:49,912 --> 00:28:51,342
I'll see you on the way down.

400
00:28:52,441 --> 00:28:54,196
You and Hoffman both.

401
00:29:04,696 --> 00:29:07,763
I need you to help me out and get
me a fresh pot of coffee, please...

402
00:29:07,926 --> 00:29:10,862
...and a full staff meeting
within the next 15 minutes, all right?

403
00:29:11,031 --> 00:29:12,919
To be fair to Mr. Holiday, Mr. Ferris...

404
00:29:13,077 --> 00:29:15,662
...Mr. Hoffman never told us
this would be such a big deal.

405
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:18,069
Ed Hoffman is the head
of the Near East Division.

406
00:29:18,232 --> 00:29:22,289
But he does not know shit until he steals it
from the guy on the ground, and that's me.

407
00:29:22,456 --> 00:29:24,876
Now, please stop acting
like such a fucking ingénue...

408
00:29:25,046 --> 00:29:28,592
...and try to get me a meeting
with Hani Salaam. Thanks.

409
00:29:44,214 --> 00:29:46,037
Mr. Ferris.

410
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:00,816
Hani Pasha.

411
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:03,315
Pasha? That is an Ottoman term.

412
00:30:03,477 --> 00:30:06,575
Well, I hear you like it, sir.
Pleasure to meet you.

413
00:30:07,092 --> 00:30:10,257
- Mr. Ferris, please take a seat.
- Thank you, sir.

414
00:30:12,917 --> 00:30:16,212
- Welcome to our promising country.
- Thank you so much.

415
00:30:16,372 --> 00:30:20,747
As reliable as your Ed Hoffman would
call a "towelhead monarchy" can be.

416
00:30:20,915 --> 00:30:23,698
Well, we'll leave that
to Ed Hoffman, sir.

417
00:30:24,370 --> 00:30:25,780
Mm.

418
00:30:28,501 --> 00:30:30,507
What have you heard about
this building?

419
00:30:30,676 --> 00:30:34,984
Well, to be quite honest, I hear
they call it the fingernail factory.

420
00:30:35,827 --> 00:30:38,129
But no one close to you would say that,
of course.

421
00:30:38,292 --> 00:30:39,698
No.

422
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:42,545
But people are stupid.

423
00:30:43,443 --> 00:30:46,859
Torture doesn't work.

424
00:30:47,443 --> 00:30:51,568
Under torture, a man will say
almost anything to make the pain stop.

425
00:30:53,171 --> 00:30:55,210
You have experience with
this, I am sure.

426
00:30:58,162 --> 00:30:59,623
Mr. Ferris, here in Jordan...

427
00:30:59,795 --> 00:31:03,091
...to the fundamentalists, you see,
I am, myself, the enemy.

428
00:31:03,826 --> 00:31:05,768
Perhaps the worst kind.

429
00:31:06,802 --> 00:31:10,926
Take not the Jews and Christians as
allies. Do you know it, Mr. Ferris?

430
00:31:17,266 --> 00:31:19,568
The dar-al-Harb. Very good.

431
00:31:19,729 --> 00:31:23,341
We are together, Hani Pasha,
in this House of War, yes.

432
00:31:23,505 --> 00:31:26,375
You are smarter than the Americans
who are usually sent to Amman.

433
00:31:26,544 --> 00:31:29,993
- Thank you, sir.
- I knew this, of course, before you came.

434
00:31:30,481 --> 00:31:33,745
You are young,
but you respect your elders.

435
00:31:33,906 --> 00:31:36,207
- You speak Arabic...
- Mm.

436
00:31:36,401 --> 00:31:38,953
...so you are a secret Arab.
- Mm.

437
00:31:46,705 --> 00:31:47,849
Now, ahem...

438
00:31:48,017 --> 00:31:50,732
We've recently discovered
a large Al-Saleem safe house...

439
00:31:50,895 --> 00:31:52,970
...and training cell here in Amman.

440
00:31:53,137 --> 00:31:55,144
I would need your help
with surveillance, sir.

441
00:31:56,592 --> 00:31:59,375
Now, this is what we know so far.

442
00:32:00,464 --> 00:32:01,446
This is unusual.

443
00:32:02,959 --> 00:32:06,058
Your Ed Hoffman would rather have less
information than share with me.

444
00:32:06,928 --> 00:32:10,125
Well, this is not Ed Hoffman.
This is not my predecessor.

445
00:32:10,288 --> 00:32:13,004
This is me, sir. Please, have a look.

446
00:32:24,910 --> 00:32:26,668
I have one rule...

447
00:32:26,831 --> 00:32:29,319
...if we are to cooperate, my dear.

448
00:32:30,287 --> 00:32:31,661
Never lie to me.

449
00:32:33,744 --> 00:32:35,498
Understand?

450
00:32:35,662 --> 00:32:37,385
Never lie to me.

451
00:32:41,773 --> 00:32:43,531
You shall have your agents.

452
00:32:43,694 --> 00:32:45,417
Thank you, sir.

453
00:32:46,350 --> 00:32:48,772
Agent Ferris is arriving
at the site now.

454
00:32:48,942 --> 00:32:50,316
Thank you.

455
00:32:50,479 --> 00:32:53,379
Tracking now. Roger that,
I'll reposition the aircraft.

456
00:32:53,551 --> 00:32:54,891
Slewing to 2.5.

457
00:33:04,206 --> 00:33:08,003
There it is. That's it.
That's the safe house.

458
00:33:13,294 --> 00:33:14,701
Come on.

459
00:33:20,462 --> 00:33:22,632
- What do you wanna do with this guy?
Just watch.

460
00:33:22,798 --> 00:33:25,382
Watch him and what else?
Nothing else.

461
00:33:26,638 --> 00:33:28,809
I'm not sure about
this GID surveillance.

462
00:33:29,452 --> 00:33:32,617
- I can't see any of Hani's guys.
- Well, I've spotted a few so far.

463
00:33:32,781 --> 00:33:36,129
You see the two by the doorway there
in front of the safe house?

464
00:33:36,299 --> 00:33:37,706
There's one more selling radios.

465
00:33:37,867 --> 00:33:40,487
And there's one behind me
with a striped shirt.

466
00:33:40,651 --> 00:33:42,080
That's what I've clocked so far.

467
00:33:44,877 --> 00:33:47,364
Who's this? Who just sat down?

468
00:33:47,531 --> 00:33:49,059
That's one of our guys.

469
00:33:49,228 --> 00:33:52,294
- One of your guys? What do you...?
- A station asset.

470
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:53,605
Zayed Ibishi.

471
00:33:54,028 --> 00:33:56,647
He's one of our contacts
from the Palestinian camps.

472
00:33:56,812 --> 00:33:58,469
Station asset, huh?

473
00:33:58,634 --> 00:34:00,970
What the fuck is he doing
making contact right now?

474
00:34:01,130 --> 00:34:04,447
- And how come I don't know about this?
- I don't know. I don't know.

475
00:34:04,971 --> 00:34:08,899
If he makes that jihadist suspicious,
they will shut down that house and leave.

476
00:34:09,068 --> 00:34:12,361
- He's gonna get that guy killed.
- He's gonna blow this whole operation.

477
00:34:13,194 --> 00:34:14,820
Not again. Fucking Hoffman!

478
00:34:21,321 --> 00:34:23,560
- Oops.
Continue tracking.

479
00:34:23,723 --> 00:34:24,835
Area expanded.

480
00:34:25,002 --> 00:34:26,375
Tracking.

481
00:34:37,419 --> 00:34:39,393
Head him off! Head him off!

482
00:34:42,410 --> 00:34:44,449
Going down the alley.
Adjusting coverage.

483
00:34:44,617 --> 00:34:45,600
Boost image factor.

484
00:34:51,529 --> 00:34:53,438
Switching to SAR.
Stay with sweep.

485
00:34:56,841 --> 00:34:58,848
Hold image?
Image locked.

486
00:35:01,130 --> 00:35:02,210
Ah!

487
00:35:25,448 --> 00:35:28,067
Skip. I got him.

488
00:35:28,233 --> 00:35:30,565
I need you to come pick
me up, all right?

489
00:35:30,727 --> 00:35:34,589
I got bit by fucking diseased dogs,
goddamn it.

490
00:35:34,761 --> 00:35:36,645
I'm by the clearing.

491
00:35:36,806 --> 00:35:38,912
Yeah, just look out for me.

492
00:35:47,239 --> 00:35:50,087
You gotta be kidding me.
Come on, take me to a real hospital.

493
00:35:50,247 --> 00:35:52,351
- Take me to the embassy.
- That's like an hour.

494
00:35:52,518 --> 00:35:56,412
Rabies around here is no joke. You're gonna
need a jab in there, ASAP. Let's go.

495
00:35:56,582 --> 00:35:58,011
Let's go.

496
00:36:03,143 --> 00:36:06,045
Let's get you vaccinated. Aisha.

497
00:36:21,733 --> 00:36:22,716
AISHA

498
00:36:24,998 --> 00:36:26,372
Let me see.

499
00:36:29,319 --> 00:36:31,008
These are not bite wounds.

500
00:36:31,622 --> 00:36:34,271
- A snowboarding accident.
- Snowboarding.

501
00:36:34,437 --> 00:36:37,787
- Mm.
- You're accident prone, huh?

502
00:36:37,958 --> 00:36:41,732
Well, I mean,
I'm sure it looks that way. Yeah.

503
00:36:41,892 --> 00:36:43,716
Okay.

504
00:36:50,053 --> 00:36:51,743
Relax.

505
00:36:52,869 --> 00:36:55,835
All right. Let me...

506
00:37:01,091 --> 00:37:03,994
My father was Iranian.

507
00:37:05,092 --> 00:37:07,297
I live in Amman now.

508
00:37:10,788 --> 00:37:12,643
Okay.

509
00:37:13,476 --> 00:37:15,364
This is going to hurt.

510
00:37:15,652 --> 00:37:17,507
Mm. I don't like needles.

511
00:37:17,668 --> 00:37:19,872
Just think about something else, hm?

512
00:37:23,588 --> 00:37:24,570
Okay.

513
00:37:26,178 --> 00:37:30,552
This is the first of five anti-rabies
injections you'll need over the next month.

514
00:37:30,723 --> 00:37:32,185
You don't need to come back here.

515
00:37:32,356 --> 00:37:36,348
You can get them at any clinic.
One each week, right?

516
00:37:36,867 --> 00:37:39,322
- So we're done?
- Yeah, we're done.

517
00:37:39,489 --> 00:37:42,174
And someone will come
to bandage your wounds.

518
00:37:43,522 --> 00:37:45,116
Thank you.

519
00:37:45,378 --> 00:37:48,379
You fucking cocksucker. How did
you expect me to run an operation...

520
00:37:48,547 --> 00:37:51,513
...when you're running a side
operation which fucks up my own?

521
00:37:51,683 --> 00:37:54,912
Listen, you want me to run Amman,
let me run Amman, all right?

522
00:37:55,076 --> 00:37:57,976
I have made promises to Hani Salaam.
Do you understand that?

523
00:37:58,147 --> 00:37:59,575
Uh-huh. What's your point?

524
00:37:59,745 --> 00:38:03,194
My point is, Ed, you can't pull
your normal bullshit here, all right?

525
00:38:03,361 --> 00:38:07,225
- We have to respect what he wants.
- I do respect him. What kind of thing?

526
00:38:07,394 --> 00:38:11,867
Look, you keep fucking around like this, and
you are gonna blow this Amman operation.

527
00:38:12,034 --> 00:38:14,335
- I love you. Bye.
- I love you too.

528
00:38:14,498 --> 00:38:17,912
They'll vacate their only known safe house,
and we'll never hear from them.

529
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:20,381
- Do you understand?
- I'm just trying to back you up.

530
00:38:20,544 --> 00:38:22,520
It's a dangerous,
dangerous world out there.

531
00:38:22,690 --> 00:38:25,472
Well, don't back me up,
because I don't need it, all right?

532
00:38:25,985 --> 00:38:28,800
- Hani.
- I gotta go deal with this Hani bullshit.

533
00:38:28,961 --> 00:38:32,189
- So go fuck yourself.
- All right, whatever.

534
00:38:33,536 --> 00:38:35,325
You ready to go?

535
00:38:35,490 --> 00:38:37,310
Whatever.

536
00:38:53,632 --> 00:38:56,415
Hani Pasha, if you would give me
an opportunity to ex...

537
00:38:57,727 --> 00:38:59,800
Fortunately the safe house is still there.

538
00:39:01,632 --> 00:39:04,535
As for the man you killed,
you were right.

539
00:39:04,704 --> 00:39:06,428
You made a good decision.

540
00:39:06,975 --> 00:39:10,619
The jihadists believe it was a robbery.
There are many robberies in that district.

541
00:39:10,783 --> 00:39:13,336
So you have been very clever, my dear.

542
00:39:13,502 --> 00:39:15,773
Well, that's good news, sir.

543
00:39:15,934 --> 00:39:17,396
Listen, Ed Hoffman had...

544
00:39:17,567 --> 00:39:20,567
I have spoken to Mr. Hoffman
very sharply.

545
00:39:20,735 --> 00:39:23,484
Now, we will explain the king's
espionage laws to his agent.

546
00:39:43,038 --> 00:39:46,299
I thought you didn't believe in torture,
Hani Pasha.

547
00:39:46,463 --> 00:39:49,909
This is punishment, my dear.
It's a very different thing.

548
00:39:54,398 --> 00:39:56,220
Keep watching.

549
00:39:57,372 --> 00:39:59,347
Tell Edward what you have seen.

550
00:41:12,666 --> 00:41:15,055
Another deadly attack
on innocent civilians.

551
00:41:15,228 --> 00:41:19,002
This time in one of Amsterdam's
most crowded tourist districts.

552
00:41:19,162 --> 00:41:22,577
The images of the bombing were captured
on location surveillance cameras.

553
00:41:22,745 --> 00:41:24,786
The blast felt for miles.

554
00:41:24,952 --> 00:41:28,117
What was once a block-long farmer
market vibrant with color...

555
00:41:28,283 --> 00:41:29,842
...is now in ruins
and covered with ash.

556
00:41:32,506 --> 00:41:34,294
The exact number of casualties
is not yet known...

557
00:41:34,456 --> 00:41:36,878
...as emergency crews are still
pulling victims from the rubble.

558
00:41:37,049 --> 00:41:40,879
But officials are saying it will
certainly be in triple figures.

559
00:41:41,370 --> 00:41:45,142
KLPD antiterror-unit investigators
have arrived...

560
00:41:45,306 --> 00:41:48,850
...and are examining bomb fragments
in the hope of determining if this...

561
00:41:49,017 --> 00:41:53,108
...and the other recent bombings on the
continent and in the UK are connected.

562
00:41:53,272 --> 00:41:57,462
The consequence of a new bombing
will no doubt have a devastating effect...

563
00:41:57,625 --> 00:41:59,828
...on Europe's tourist business.

564
00:41:59,993 --> 00:42:03,374
Let's go now
to Amsterdam's chief of police.

565
00:42:03,543 --> 00:42:08,116
We will do whatever we can
to keep everyone safe...

566
00:42:08,281 --> 00:42:11,574
...for you to live every day
without being afraid.

567
00:42:11,737 --> 00:42:13,843
But we must be realistic.

568
00:42:14,007 --> 00:42:19,310
Terrorist threats are real, present,
deadly and persistent.

569
00:42:22,168 --> 00:42:24,502
- Good morning, sir.
- Good morning.

570
00:42:26,551 --> 00:42:27,532
Where are we going?

571
00:42:27,705 --> 00:42:29,526
We are going fishing.

572
00:42:29,687 --> 00:42:31,181
Get in.

573
00:42:38,199 --> 00:42:40,436
Since no credit was claimed
for the bombing...

574
00:42:40,598 --> 00:42:43,249
...we believe it to be the work
of Al-Saleem.

575
00:42:43,416 --> 00:42:45,782
That's his signature. Anonymity.

576
00:42:46,775 --> 00:42:49,076
So, what we need is... May I say we?

577
00:42:49,237 --> 00:42:52,554
Of course.
As long as we keep it between us.

578
00:42:53,207 --> 00:42:55,442
We need a man inside the Amman cell.

579
00:42:55,607 --> 00:42:57,013
We do. Yes.

580
00:42:57,174 --> 00:42:58,700
And we shall have the man we need.

581
00:42:58,871 --> 00:43:02,381
- How's that?
- Because you gave him to me.

582
00:43:03,957 --> 00:43:07,154
His name is Mustafa Karami.
I've known him since he was a teenager...

583
00:43:07,318 --> 00:43:10,065
...selling boom boxes
from the back of a stolen truck.

584
00:43:10,231 --> 00:43:12,815
Now he's al Qaeda. In my country.

585
00:43:14,102 --> 00:43:15,663
Watch and learn, my dear.

586
00:43:15,828 --> 00:43:17,040
Watch and learn.

587
00:43:51,604 --> 00:43:52,880
KARAMl:

588
00:43:54,293 --> 00:43:57,041
You did not think to tell
Hani Salaam you are a jihadist?

589
00:43:58,197 --> 00:44:01,325
You have become
a religious man, hm?

590
00:44:01,492 --> 00:44:03,018
No longer a thief.

591
00:44:03,922 --> 00:44:05,615
Can it be true?

592
00:44:06,707 --> 00:44:07,819
Here.

593
00:44:09,618 --> 00:44:10,765
Take the phone.

594
00:44:10,930 --> 00:44:13,264
Take it and talk to your mother.

595
00:44:13,874 --> 00:44:15,280
Talk.

596
00:44:18,227 --> 00:44:20,300
Hello? Hello?
- Hello.

597
00:44:21,939 --> 00:44:25,135
His mother was in
the Palestinian camps.

598
00:44:25,299 --> 00:44:28,713
Now she has a fine apartment
and a beautiful garden.

599
00:44:28,883 --> 00:44:32,080
She can watch the sun set
over the hills.

600
00:44:32,243 --> 00:44:37,130
She has a refrigerator, couch,
even a television set.

601
00:44:37,297 --> 00:44:41,008
She will tell him she is proud of him, that
she always knew he would be a success...

602
00:44:41,170 --> 00:44:43,591
...even when he was a little boy
in the refugee camps.

603
00:44:43,763 --> 00:44:45,617
And now he has sent her money.

604
00:44:45,778 --> 00:44:47,852
She is glad he is no longer mixed up
with the radicals.

605
00:45:01,489 --> 00:45:04,456
You are God's blessing to your mother,
Mustafa.

606
00:45:05,136 --> 00:45:07,952
You have done none of these things for her.
But you should have.

607
00:45:08,753 --> 00:45:11,536
A mother is worth more
than anything they have told you.

608
00:45:11,697 --> 00:45:15,888
You know, you will be better in the future
because we have sent her many gifts...

609
00:45:16,049 --> 00:45:18,538
...and we have told her these gifts come
from her son.

610
00:45:25,008 --> 00:45:27,430
Continue your life with your brothers
in al Qaeda.

611
00:45:27,601 --> 00:45:29,706
We will devise a way to talk. Come.

612
00:45:31,311 --> 00:45:34,311
Come. No, no, no. Come, come, come.

613
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:37,065
Up, up, up.

614
00:45:39,950 --> 00:45:41,195
Go.

615
00:45:47,376 --> 00:45:50,791
And so we throw him back into the sea,
to swim where he naturally swims...

616
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:53,611
...to learn what he naturally learns...

617
00:45:53,774 --> 00:45:56,393
...and see how long he remembers
my benevolence.

618
00:45:57,807 --> 00:45:59,149
And what if he forgets?

619
00:46:00,270 --> 00:46:04,262
If he forgets, I remind him that I have
the power of life and death over him...

620
00:46:04,430 --> 00:46:08,653
...because, you see, any time I wish,
I can let them know he works for me.

621
00:46:09,838 --> 00:46:11,082
Hm.

622
00:46:13,743 --> 00:46:14,822
Ed?

623
00:46:14,990 --> 00:46:16,779
So tell me about Hani's guy.

624
00:46:16,941 --> 00:46:18,764
- Who?
- Karami, the guy on the bike.

625
00:46:18,926 --> 00:46:21,260
What do you think I do in my
spare time, play tennis?

626
00:46:21,422 --> 00:46:24,456
- I look like a tennis player to you?
- It's not gonna happen, Ed.

627
00:46:24,621 --> 00:46:28,364
Buddy, we're a results-oriented
organization, and we need results now...

628
00:46:28,525 --> 00:46:30,348
...because otherwise
I will be unhappy.

629
00:46:30,510 --> 00:46:32,683
You'll be unhappy,
and he'll say, "Insa. "

630
00:46:32,846 --> 00:46:33,892
What does that mean?

631
00:46:34,061 --> 00:46:35,818
Means "too fucking bad,"
is what it means.

632
00:46:35,980 --> 00:46:39,210
Too fucking bad? Europe is
getting hammered, boy. All right?

633
00:46:39,372 --> 00:46:41,380
Nobody knows where the next bomb
is going off.

634
00:46:41,548 --> 00:46:43,458
There's 75 dead in Amsterdam.

635
00:46:43,629 --> 00:46:45,962
You can call me sentimental
if you want to, buddy...

636
00:46:46,125 --> 00:46:47,782
Ed, listen, Hani does not trust you.

637
00:46:47,950 --> 00:46:49,859
Arabs will only help you
if they trust you.

638
00:46:50,028 --> 00:46:51,915
We need to earn that trust,
you understand?

639
00:46:52,077 --> 00:46:53,222
What are you, moving here?

640
00:46:53,388 --> 00:46:57,415
I don't care about cultural insecurity issues.
I don't care if Hani trusts me or not.

641
00:46:57,580 --> 00:47:00,135
What he will do is he will thank me
in the long run. Fuck.

642
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:02,209
Hold on. Hold on.

643
00:47:03,789 --> 00:47:05,510
Buddy, you're home.

644
00:47:06,861 --> 00:47:09,643
Jesus Christ, Ed,
you scared the shit out of me.

645
00:47:09,804 --> 00:47:12,455
They say that you should
never drink red wine in the desert.

646
00:47:12,619 --> 00:47:14,508
That's what did in
the Babylonians, right?

647
00:47:14,668 --> 00:47:18,344
Well, a couple of bottles of that
and we'll be speaking Babylonian.

648
00:47:18,507 --> 00:47:21,258
So how was your flight?

649
00:47:21,418 --> 00:47:25,097
Oh, it was fine. It was fine.
Yeah. I watched that Poseidon.

650
00:47:26,410 --> 00:47:29,410
I see you've made yourself at home.

651
00:47:43,307 --> 00:47:45,763
In the words of the great Sam Snead:

652
00:47:45,931 --> 00:47:49,858
"If you're not thinking about pussy,
you're just not concentrating. "

653
00:47:50,026 --> 00:47:51,138
My dear.

654
00:47:51,307 --> 00:47:53,031
Jesus Christ. Come on.

655
00:47:55,658 --> 00:47:57,151
Hani Pasha.

656
00:47:57,323 --> 00:47:58,697
Thank you for your time.

657
00:47:58,858 --> 00:48:00,068
Please.

658
00:48:00,681 --> 00:48:04,030
I'm gonna need a piece of this guy you got
here in this Amman cell.

659
00:48:04,202 --> 00:48:06,657
Don't look at buddy.
Buddy didn't say nothing.

660
00:48:06,826 --> 00:48:10,534
These jihadists might not use their cell
phones, Hani, but you do use yours, right?

661
00:48:11,178 --> 00:48:12,160
Please.

662
00:48:12,329 --> 00:48:15,145
Now, don't say no before I say anything.

663
00:48:15,306 --> 00:48:17,827
Just let me say
what I've come here to say.

664
00:48:18,729 --> 00:48:23,748
Thank you. You have done an incredible job
developing this guy Karoobi.

665
00:48:24,616 --> 00:48:25,793
Katoomi.

666
00:48:25,961 --> 00:48:27,520
- Karami.
Karami.

667
00:48:27,689 --> 00:48:31,999
Now, we develop these assets
to use them as needed.

668
00:48:32,169 --> 00:48:33,346
And I have a need.

669
00:48:34,217 --> 00:48:35,972
No.

670
00:48:38,857 --> 00:48:42,204
- I'm just gonna get all frustrated here.
- Why are you frustrated, Edward?

671
00:48:42,377 --> 00:48:43,969
Because we have a partnership.

672
00:48:44,135 --> 00:48:46,373
You have something that I need
that will help me...

673
00:48:46,536 --> 00:48:48,097
...and you won't allow
that to happen.

674
00:48:48,264 --> 00:48:51,297
And I'm trying to impress upon you
a sense of urgency.

675
00:48:51,464 --> 00:48:55,773
Urgency does not call for changing methods
that work for methods that do not work.

676
00:48:56,615 --> 00:48:58,590
Now, who pays the bills around here?

677
00:48:58,761 --> 00:49:01,510
I would hate to have to have my president
call your king.

678
00:49:01,671 --> 00:49:04,127
Because that's just gonna
be embarrassing for all of us.

679
00:49:04,296 --> 00:49:07,907
In matters of intelligence, Edward,
you are speaking to the king.

680
00:49:08,072 --> 00:49:09,762
- Is that right?
- Mm.

681
00:49:10,534 --> 00:49:14,147
Well, Your Highness, I want control.

682
00:49:14,310 --> 00:49:17,857
- As a favor to the United States.
- You can't have it.

683
00:49:18,952 --> 00:49:22,845
I could tell you we will run him jointly,
but it would not be the truth.

684
00:49:23,014 --> 00:49:27,074
Real intelligence operations,
they remain secret forever.

685
00:49:28,038 --> 00:49:32,959
You Americans, you are incapable
of secrecy because you are a democracy.

686
00:49:33,125 --> 00:49:36,160
Now, I know my business.

687
00:49:36,326 --> 00:49:38,659
I have never failed you, have I?

688
00:49:38,821 --> 00:49:43,873
No, you have not. Are you sure
you wanna make this the first time?

689
00:49:44,069 --> 00:49:46,787
Edward, you're missing the point.

690
00:49:46,950 --> 00:49:48,739
Karami, he doesn't know anything.

691
00:49:48,902 --> 00:49:51,270
That is not the way
the organization operates.

692
00:49:51,429 --> 00:49:55,454
I will ask him what he knows
when it is time.

693
00:49:55,621 --> 00:49:58,851
- Now, are you happy?
- I'm getting there.

694
00:50:00,581 --> 00:50:02,785
Now, you guys
might have invented algebra...

695
00:50:02,950 --> 00:50:05,186
...but we're the guys
that found out how to use it.

696
00:50:05,349 --> 00:50:08,283
I presume you know who that is?

697
00:50:08,453 --> 00:50:10,276
It's a recent photograph of Al-Saleem.

698
00:50:10,435 --> 00:50:12,608
You didn't have that one, did you?

699
00:50:12,772 --> 00:50:15,424
Well, that's yours.
You can keep that because we're partners.

700
00:50:15,590 --> 00:50:19,298
All right? Now, I'm fulfilling my side
of the bargain, okay?

701
00:50:19,460 --> 00:50:22,756
Now's the time for some reciprocity.

702
00:50:24,228 --> 00:50:26,017
You need to give me Karami.

703
00:50:31,812 --> 00:50:32,795
Insa.

704
00:50:34,019 --> 00:50:38,623
- That's, "Too fucking bad. "
- I know what that means.

705
00:50:39,460 --> 00:50:41,563
Well, that was
fucking embarrassing, hm?

706
00:50:42,436 --> 00:50:44,345
You still thinking about pussy, Ed?

707
00:50:44,514 --> 00:50:48,607
Don't be a smart aleck.
Thing about that Hani, he's bright.

708
00:50:48,771 --> 00:50:51,074
But he's also arrogant.
That's gonna be his undoing.

709
00:50:51,236 --> 00:50:53,375
You're talking about him, right?

710
00:50:53,539 --> 00:50:54,686
Just flow with me, buddy.

711
00:50:54,852 --> 00:50:58,397
Jesus Christ. You have a recent photograph
of Al-Saleem.

712
00:50:58,562 --> 00:51:01,084
Don't you think I could've used intel
like that, Ed?

713
00:51:01,251 --> 00:51:03,617
What the hell else
are you holding back from me?

714
00:51:03,779 --> 00:51:04,794
What do you wanna know?

715
00:51:04,963 --> 00:51:06,849
Well, for one thing, what's his real name?

716
00:51:07,009 --> 00:51:09,563
Kareem Al-Shams.

717
00:51:10,307 --> 00:51:11,682
His birthplace?

718
00:51:11,843 --> 00:51:14,625
Syria. Hama.

719
00:51:15,682 --> 00:51:17,310
Background?

720
00:51:17,473 --> 00:51:21,696
Well, his loving middle-class family
got killed by Hafez Assad...

721
00:51:21,857 --> 00:51:24,062
...so he moved to Saudi Arabia.

722
00:51:24,226 --> 00:51:28,502
Studied physics and engineering
in Riyadh, then here in Amman.

723
00:51:28,674 --> 00:51:32,316
Post-graduate study at the University of
North Carolina. He's a Tar Heel like you.

724
00:51:32,482 --> 00:51:36,190
Now, he prides himself on his humility
and not having to take the credit.

725
00:51:36,353 --> 00:51:39,669
Yet this is the same man who will go
on videotape with his brothers...

726
00:51:39,841 --> 00:51:42,459
...describing what he's done
and what's gonna come.

727
00:51:42,626 --> 00:51:45,528
His is a false humility.
It's a false modesty.

728
00:51:45,698 --> 00:51:49,079
His ego is more powerful than
his beliefs, more dangerous.

729
00:51:49,249 --> 00:51:50,841
And that is his weakness.

730
00:51:51,009 --> 00:51:56,312
Now, all we got to do, Ferris,
is just get that fucker on the phone.

731
00:52:00,578 --> 00:52:01,558
Ed?

732
00:52:01,729 --> 00:52:03,288
Yeah.

733
00:52:03,456 --> 00:52:07,712
Don't do anything about Karami, huh?
Don't try to flip him or anything like that.

734
00:52:07,871 --> 00:52:09,944
Hani will throw me out.
I promise you that.

735
00:52:10,111 --> 00:52:11,769
This operation will be over.

736
00:52:12,831 --> 00:52:16,378
You cannot trust Hani. Am I clear?

737
00:52:17,217 --> 00:52:18,972
You're clear.

738
00:52:20,256 --> 00:52:23,322
Good. You and I gotta get drunk
because I need to sleep on the plane.

739
00:52:23,487 --> 00:52:26,750
I have to take the kids
to The Lion King. Again.

740
00:52:27,967 --> 00:52:29,177
Never have kids.

741
00:52:30,463 --> 00:52:33,810
-Ed, did you hear what I said, right?
-Oh, yeah.

742
00:52:33,984 --> 00:52:38,107
- Don't... Don't touch Karami.
- All right.

743
00:52:38,623 --> 00:52:40,444
Never.

744
00:52:56,190 --> 00:52:58,460
That's Karami. We're on. Get the van.

745
00:53:29,085 --> 00:53:31,158
Move the fucking van!

746
00:53:33,532 --> 00:53:35,803
Go! Go, go, go!

747
00:53:42,301 --> 00:53:43,283
Fuck!

748
00:53:54,331 --> 00:53:57,843
I thought I told you
you could get this at any clinic.

749
00:53:58,014 --> 00:54:02,289
And you should have had
your injection yesterday.

750
00:54:02,459 --> 00:54:04,631
You weren't on duty yesterday.

751
00:54:04,794 --> 00:54:08,756
Besides, when you find a good doctor,
you don't change, right?

752
00:54:08,924 --> 00:54:10,069
I'm not a doctor.

753
00:54:14,267 --> 00:54:16,089
The same thing. You don't change.

754
00:54:17,405 --> 00:54:18,387
Wife.

755
00:54:18,555 --> 00:54:21,337
Well, I don't have a ring.

756
00:54:21,498 --> 00:54:23,921
No, but you did last week.

757
00:54:24,123 --> 00:54:26,392
Ah. So you noticed?

758
00:54:27,708 --> 00:54:29,115
Bad husband.

759
00:54:29,818 --> 00:54:32,817
Ah! Yes. Ahem.
Yes, I was a bad husband.

760
00:54:32,986 --> 00:54:35,190
And she was an even worse wife...

761
00:54:35,356 --> 00:54:38,104
...which is why we're divorced now.

762
00:54:38,266 --> 00:54:39,249
It's over.

763
00:54:42,299 --> 00:54:44,720
And now you're looking
for something else, huh?

764
00:54:45,402 --> 00:54:48,304
Something as different from her
as you can find.

765
00:54:48,474 --> 00:54:51,988
Something close to impossible.

766
00:54:52,153 --> 00:54:53,714
We're done.

767
00:54:54,617 --> 00:54:56,046
Till next week.

768
00:55:03,704 --> 00:55:05,267
May I?

769
00:55:05,433 --> 00:55:07,536
Yes.

770
00:55:08,408 --> 00:55:10,797
I was wondering if maybe...

771
00:55:10,970 --> 00:55:14,743
...you wanted to have a conversation
sooner than next week.

772
00:55:14,905 --> 00:55:18,135
Maybe, inshallah,
later this afternoon...

773
00:55:18,298 --> 00:55:20,402
...if that wouldn't make you
uncomfortable.

774
00:55:21,721 --> 00:55:25,648
Well, for you and me
to be able to do that...

775
00:55:25,815 --> 00:55:28,151
...first we would have
to have a conversation...

776
00:55:28,312 --> 00:55:30,962
...about the proper way
to have a conversation.

777
00:55:32,024 --> 00:55:33,934
Anyway, where I'm going
this afternoon...

778
00:55:34,104 --> 00:55:37,169
...would make you more uncomfortable
than me.

779
00:55:37,336 --> 00:55:40,205
Well, I doubt that.

780
00:55:40,376 --> 00:55:42,133
I don't.

781
00:56:10,933 --> 00:56:11,982
WOMAN

782
00:56:18,358 --> 00:56:21,935
If you're trying to figure out how far
I'll go in order to express my interest...

783
00:56:22,103 --> 00:56:24,436
...I think you have the answer.

784
00:56:25,240 --> 00:56:27,378
- Do I?
- Mm.

785
00:56:27,542 --> 00:56:30,672
What else are you supposed to do
at this point? Leave here alone?

786
00:56:31,223 --> 00:56:34,035
You're safer with me and you know it.

787
00:56:34,198 --> 00:56:36,086
What are you asking?

788
00:56:36,244 --> 00:56:38,612
I'm asking what you do here.

789
00:56:39,285 --> 00:56:40,910
Well, I'm a political adviser.

790
00:56:42,196 --> 00:56:43,724
Who snowboards in Amman.

791
00:56:43,893 --> 00:56:46,315
- That's right.
- Yeah, yeah.

792
00:56:46,485 --> 00:56:50,259
Listen, I have a thing to tell you,
an important one.

793
00:56:50,421 --> 00:56:53,617
A man is not his job.

794
00:56:53,781 --> 00:56:56,912
I mean, he's apart from
his job. The man.

795
00:56:57,076 --> 00:56:58,833
I understand.

796
00:56:58,996 --> 00:57:01,866
No, I just want you
to know my feeling, my...

797
00:57:02,037 --> 00:57:04,754
My understanding of you.

798
00:57:04,916 --> 00:57:07,154
- Well, thank you.
- You're welcome.

799
00:57:16,179 --> 00:57:18,568
May I see you again, Aisha?

800
00:57:26,739 --> 00:57:29,009
When you wish and with
your permission, of course.

801
00:57:29,170 --> 00:57:32,586
Where did you learn to speak Arabic
like this?

802
00:57:33,457 --> 00:57:35,947
Yeah, yeah, we are friends.

803
00:57:36,114 --> 00:57:37,325
We may talk again.

804
00:57:38,292 --> 00:57:39,883
We may.

805
00:57:40,050 --> 00:57:42,222
Well, thank you.

806
00:57:57,169 --> 00:57:58,795
He's my friend.

807
00:58:00,658 --> 00:58:03,244
- It's fine. It's fine.
- You sure?

808
00:58:04,401 --> 00:58:05,677
It's fine.

809
00:58:07,282 --> 00:58:08,394
What's this all about?

810
00:59:35,022 --> 00:59:37,477
Marwan showed you the burning house?

811
00:59:38,351 --> 00:59:39,560
Do you know what happened?

812
00:59:39,725 --> 00:59:41,995
I have absolutely no idea.

813
00:59:43,119 --> 00:59:46,859
You see, you could have said
to me yes or no. Simply that.

814
00:59:47,023 --> 00:59:51,015
When a man says to me more
than yes or no, then I begin to wonder.

815
00:59:51,182 --> 00:59:54,150
I don't know what happened, Hani.

816
00:59:56,525 --> 01:00:00,868
We had the advantage. That house
could have led us to Al-Saleem.

817
01:00:01,037 --> 01:00:03,491
Now it is gone.
Everything inside it is gone.

818
01:00:03,664 --> 01:00:05,320
Here. Kneel.
- Hani, listen to me, I...

819
01:00:05,484 --> 01:00:07,906
I told you never to lie to me.

820
01:00:08,077 --> 01:00:09,802
I am not lying to you, Hani.

821
01:00:09,965 --> 01:00:13,095
You did not know that this man,
after everything I said to you...

822
01:00:13,262 --> 01:00:16,296
...everything I said to Edward,
that he tried to take Karami?

823
01:00:17,485 --> 01:00:19,721
He did not know.

824
01:00:19,884 --> 01:00:22,023
When I want to speak with you,
I will look at you.

825
01:00:23,501 --> 01:00:24,909
Now I am talking to Mr. Ferris.

826
01:00:25,900 --> 01:00:28,616
So in as few words as possible...

827
01:00:29,228 --> 01:00:30,504
...did you know?

828
01:00:31,211 --> 01:00:32,902
No.

829
01:00:33,069 --> 01:00:35,010
I don't believe you.

830
01:00:35,755 --> 01:00:37,993
You have 12 hours to leave Jordan.

831
01:00:38,154 --> 01:00:41,320
If I find you here, I will not
be responsible for your safety.

832
01:00:41,484 --> 01:00:42,891
Do you understand me?

833
01:00:58,123 --> 01:01:00,708
Now, you knew you needed
to adapt to this environment.

834
01:01:00,874 --> 01:01:03,264
Ferris, I know, but, you know, I...

835
01:01:10,314 --> 01:01:11,460
Ferris!

836
01:01:17,482 --> 01:01:18,887
Ferris!

837
01:01:35,496 --> 01:01:38,846
Well, hey, buddy.
Back from the sandbox?

838
01:01:39,018 --> 01:01:41,221
Enjoying civilization?
You wanna get a hot dog?

839
01:01:41,386 --> 01:01:44,613
How do you expect me to operate, Ed,
when you're keeping all the cards?

840
01:01:44,777 --> 01:01:47,495
- What about an ice cream?
- All Hani wanted was patience, Ed.

841
01:01:47,657 --> 01:01:50,210
- Patience. Not as a personal quality...
- I don't care.

842
01:01:50,377 --> 01:01:53,889
Not as a personal quality, but an operational
requirement, and you can't do it?

843
01:01:54,056 --> 01:01:57,375
You're too power hungry and greedy.
You fucked this whole operation up!

844
01:01:57,543 --> 01:01:59,779
For chrissakes,
I thought Hani wanted to kill me!

845
01:01:59,944 --> 01:02:01,056
Oh, don't exaggerate.

846
01:02:01,225 --> 01:02:04,739
Hani don't want to kill you.
He likes you. He likes you a lot.

847
01:02:04,905 --> 01:02:08,897
And who is he gonna get over there
better for him than you? Nobody.

848
01:02:09,352 --> 01:02:12,255
Don't worry. You're gonna
be back in Jordan before you know it.

849
01:02:12,424 --> 01:02:14,496
Back with your Jordanian
piece of poontang...

850
01:02:14,665 --> 01:02:17,315
...that you think I don't know about,
but I do.

851
01:02:17,480 --> 01:02:20,068
You're a fat fucking piece of shit,
you know that, Ed?

852
01:02:20,230 --> 01:02:22,915
We do this shit for a living,
go on a diet, for chrissakes.

853
01:02:23,080 --> 01:02:27,235
Are you quite finished?
Now, I did what I had to do.

854
01:02:28,392 --> 01:02:30,879
I ain't got time to play
Patience, Sidi, Patience...

855
01:02:31,046 --> 01:02:33,217
...and sit around eating couscous.

856
01:02:35,688 --> 01:02:39,136
Hani's interests extend only
to his own little fiefdom.

857
01:02:39,302 --> 01:02:40,677
Mine are global.

858
01:02:42,278 --> 01:02:43,708
Now, having said that...

859
01:02:43,879 --> 01:02:48,964
...I admit that perhaps, possibly, I should
have, from an operational standpoint...

860
01:02:49,127 --> 01:02:51,232
...brought you into what I was doing.
- Exactly.

861
01:02:51,398 --> 01:02:54,628
What you should've done was listen
to what Hani said, and you know that.

862
01:02:58,055 --> 01:03:00,737
You know, 10 years ago,
I could've beat the crap out of you.

863
01:03:00,903 --> 01:03:03,074
Should've taken the shot
when you had the chance.

864
01:03:03,238 --> 01:03:05,343
Maybe I should've. Can't do it now.

865
01:03:06,406 --> 01:03:09,789
What we need to do,
with or without the cooperation of Hani...

866
01:03:09,958 --> 01:03:13,601
...is get our own man
inside Al-Saleem's tent.

867
01:03:14,820 --> 01:03:17,637
We could penetrate every goddamn
Salafi mosque in the world...

868
01:03:17,797 --> 01:03:19,937
...and still not even get close.

869
01:03:24,326 --> 01:03:26,781
- But Al-Saleem doesn't know that, right?
- What?

870
01:03:26,949 --> 01:03:30,777
He doesn't know that.
I mean, he doesn't know what we can't do.

871
01:03:30,949 --> 01:03:32,892
He doesn't know how close
or how far we are.

872
01:03:33,061 --> 01:03:34,882
He doesn't know what's true
or what isn't.

873
01:03:35,046 --> 01:03:38,753
I mean... Look, Osama fed Zarqawi
to the dogs...

874
01:03:38,916 --> 01:03:40,924
...because he was getting
too powerful, right?

875
01:03:41,093 --> 01:03:43,296
- Right.
- What if instead of tracking Al-Saleem...

876
01:03:43,462 --> 01:03:46,461
...like we're doing right now
with absolutely no results...

877
01:03:46,628 --> 01:03:50,272
...we make it appear that there
is another terrorist operation out there...

878
01:03:50,436 --> 01:03:52,063
...just as effective as his own?

879
01:03:52,228 --> 01:03:55,970
I mean, how would Al-Saleem react
to that kind of challenge to his stats?

880
01:03:56,131 --> 01:03:58,520
- What would he do?
- He would get paranoid.

881
01:03:58,692 --> 01:04:01,180
- He might rejoice. Maybe both.
- Exactly.

882
01:04:01,348 --> 01:04:03,999
But either way,
he'd try to get in contact with them, right?

883
01:04:04,164 --> 01:04:06,584
- Right.
- Which would be us.

884
01:04:07,556 --> 01:04:09,344
That would be us.

885
01:04:10,564 --> 01:04:13,465
You're a devious SOB.

886
01:04:13,635 --> 01:04:16,983
- We can't do this out of Langley.
- No. No, sir.

887
01:04:36,608 --> 01:04:39,546
Garland. Roger Ferris.
Pleased to meet you.

888
01:04:39,714 --> 01:04:41,058
Where's Hoffman?

889
01:04:41,219 --> 01:04:43,389
I don't know. Ben & Jerry's.

890
01:04:46,338 --> 01:04:48,280
He trusts you.

891
01:04:48,450 --> 01:04:53,119
I don't trust him. Every time we run
an operation and I don't see Hoffman...

892
01:04:53,281 --> 01:04:56,095
...it means he's running
another operation. Coffee?

893
01:04:56,257 --> 01:04:58,941
Yes, please. Black. Thank you.

894
01:04:59,779 --> 01:05:03,290
- Fruit? Strawberries, plums, apples?
- No, thanks.

895
01:05:04,609 --> 01:05:07,609
We're tracking a cell in Syria.
Last night, they were in Damascus.

896
01:05:07,776 --> 01:05:11,738
Today, Dayr Az-Zawr and the Iraqi border.

897
01:05:11,906 --> 01:05:14,972
But something tells me
they won't make it to Hasbaya.

898
01:05:15,138 --> 01:05:19,480
We have ninjas waiting.

899
01:05:19,648 --> 01:05:22,298
Who do these ninjas work for?

900
01:05:22,466 --> 01:05:23,838
Me.

901
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:25,657
Shall we?

902
01:05:33,055 --> 01:05:36,122
So where is everyone?

903
01:05:36,288 --> 01:05:38,143
Absolutely no idea what you mean.

904
01:05:38,304 --> 01:05:43,738
- What? You mean it's just you?
- No. It's me and you.

905
01:05:43,905 --> 01:05:46,719
Did you think there'd be some
war room with lights flashing...

906
01:05:46,879 --> 01:05:48,220
...and people with clipboards?

907
01:05:48,384 --> 01:05:51,351
No, it's all here and here and here.
And here.

908
01:05:51,520 --> 01:05:54,106
Sure you won't have a strawberry?
They're really delicious.

909
01:05:54,270 --> 01:05:56,540
Yeah, no, I'm positive.

910
01:05:56,704 --> 01:06:00,664
Look, I'm gonna need some really, really
low-level al Qaeda contacts, all right?

911
01:06:00,830 --> 01:06:04,476
No one too extreme. Picture somewhere
in between Osama and Oprah.

912
01:06:04,639 --> 01:06:05,718
You get my drift?

913
01:06:05,887 --> 01:06:09,018
I'm gonna need a security consultant,
a lawyer.

914
01:06:09,183 --> 01:06:12,182
I'm gonna need an Arab who travels
throughout the region, all right?

915
01:06:12,350 --> 01:06:16,541
A businessman. Someone who fits the role
of jihadist without actually being jihadist.

916
01:06:16,702 --> 01:06:17,816
A straw man.

917
01:06:19,166 --> 01:06:22,744
Receiving money, making plans.

918
01:06:22,909 --> 01:06:24,732
That kind of thing.

919
01:06:25,502 --> 01:06:27,444
Okay, no.

920
01:06:27,614 --> 01:06:29,272
No.

921
01:06:29,438 --> 01:06:30,616
No.

922
01:06:32,061 --> 01:06:34,616
Hang on. There you go.
Second from the top.

923
01:06:34,781 --> 01:06:37,531
Omar Sadiki. He's Jordanian.
He's an architect.

924
01:06:38,398 --> 01:06:42,140
Most of his commissions
are from charitable Islamic groups...

925
01:06:42,301 --> 01:06:44,089
...who then give money to the jihadists.

926
01:06:44,254 --> 01:06:46,621
So he ticks all the jihadist boxes...

927
01:06:46,781 --> 01:06:49,530
...except he's innocent.

928
01:06:49,693 --> 01:06:52,441
So he touches his head to the floor
five times a day.

929
01:06:52,605 --> 01:06:55,059
He believes in God.

930
01:06:55,228 --> 01:06:58,328
So why would he trade
with an infidel like myself?

931
01:07:00,253 --> 01:07:01,365
Money.

932
01:07:22,843 --> 01:07:24,982
Mr. Sadiki.

933
01:07:27,515 --> 01:07:29,076
Hello, Mr. Sadiki.

934
01:07:29,244 --> 01:07:32,407
Mr. Sadiki, it's Brad Scanlon
from Hayes Andover Bank.

935
01:07:32,570 --> 01:07:34,774
I'm following up on my email.

936
01:07:35,356 --> 01:07:36,337
Yeah.

937
01:07:36,508 --> 01:07:39,225
Yeah, well, listen,
I got into Dubai a little bit early.

938
01:07:39,387 --> 01:07:45,104
I'm staying at the Jumeirah Emirates
Towers, but I can meet you anywhere.

939
01:07:45,275 --> 01:07:46,899
Well, fantastic.

940
01:07:53,979 --> 01:07:55,353
Anything else to know?

941
01:07:55,514 --> 01:07:57,042
Exactly as we discussed.

942
01:07:57,467 --> 01:07:58,450
I'm cool with that.

943
01:07:58,619 --> 01:08:00,985
- I'm used to knowing nothing.
- I'm sure you are, Tony.

944
01:08:01,146 --> 01:08:03,633
- Just get in position.
- Okay, boss.

945
01:08:05,691 --> 01:08:07,413
Mr. Sadiki.
- Yeah.

946
01:08:07,578 --> 01:08:12,247
Hayes Andover's option to buy this property
is gonna expire by the end of the month.

947
01:08:12,410 --> 01:08:14,483
We're hoping to get some sketches
and a bid...

948
01:08:14,650 --> 01:08:17,235
...by, say, next Thursday
before the Islamic weekend.

949
01:08:17,402 --> 01:08:19,257
Well, I think...

950
01:08:19,418 --> 01:08:20,725
- Yes, certainly.
- Hm.

951
01:08:20,891 --> 01:08:23,738
You'll also have to sign a letter
of intent with Mr. Al-Masri...

952
01:08:23,898 --> 01:08:25,391
...if that's okay with you.

953
01:08:25,561 --> 01:08:27,088
- Makes no difference to me.
- Great.

954
01:08:27,256 --> 01:08:31,895
-Allah will decide if I get the job or not.
-Fantastic.

955
01:08:32,057 --> 01:08:33,780
Mr. Al-Masri?

956
01:08:34,296 --> 01:08:35,279
Mr. Omar Sadiki.

957
01:08:41,656 --> 01:08:44,111
- Would anyone like some coffee?
- Yes, please. Thank you.

958
01:08:44,280 --> 01:08:47,478
Ed, Al-Masri
is a lawyer we found with al Qaeda ties.

959
01:08:47,641 --> 01:08:50,423
He's fairly low on the map,
but he is on the map...

960
01:08:50,584 --> 01:08:54,064
...enough for a photograph
to suggest Sadiki's guilt by association.

961
01:08:54,233 --> 01:08:56,336
Mm-hm. You have his computer?

962
01:08:57,049 --> 01:08:59,022
Yeah, look,
I'm gonna go get it right now.

963
01:08:59,193 --> 01:09:01,778
He's going to the Cyclone Club.
He loves the Russian girls.

964
01:09:01,943 --> 01:09:04,400
I'll call you soon. Call you soon.

965
01:09:05,626 --> 01:09:07,217
Three-sixteen.

966
01:09:48,631 --> 01:09:49,644
Come on, baby.

967
01:09:55,318 --> 01:09:56,594
- Garland?
- Yeah?

968
01:09:56,757 --> 01:09:58,448
Stand by. All right?

969
01:09:59,734 --> 01:10:02,286
Just getting in right now.

970
01:10:11,958 --> 01:10:14,828
Ah. This is useful.

971
01:10:15,475 --> 01:10:17,549
Very useful.

972
01:10:17,716 --> 01:10:22,387
I have an e-mail list of the members
of the Brothers of Awareness.

973
01:10:22,548 --> 01:10:24,522
The Brothers of who-the-fuck?

974
01:10:24,693 --> 01:10:28,205
The Ikhwan Ishfan. They're just a study
group of believers at his local mosque.

975
01:10:28,372 --> 01:10:30,259
But I can make it look like anything.

976
01:10:30,421 --> 01:10:33,488
All right. Let's make it look
like everything, huh?

977
01:10:41,013 --> 01:10:44,492
Now, make fake accounts
for half a dozen of the brothers...

978
01:10:44,660 --> 01:10:48,369
...and start transferring money to them
from Sadiki's fake receiver account.

979
01:10:48,531 --> 01:10:50,353
Just small operational sums.

980
01:10:50,515 --> 01:10:51,758
Okay.

981
01:10:55,283 --> 01:10:58,795
The Saudis will pick up the money moving,
and everything they pick up...

982
01:10:58,962 --> 01:11:01,298
They'll leak to the jihadists.

983
01:11:01,458 --> 01:11:05,070
- You got it, my friend.
- It's coming up. Now it's done.

984
01:11:41,393 --> 01:11:43,117
Dad! Dad!

985
01:11:43,954 --> 01:11:46,158
Hey, baby. Hold on. Oh.

986
01:11:48,656 --> 01:11:50,958
Hey, Ed, you there?
- Where are you?

987
01:11:51,121 --> 01:11:53,391
Dubai International. I'm on my way back.

988
01:11:53,552 --> 01:11:56,334
No, no, no. No, you're not.
You're going back to Amman.

989
01:11:56,882 --> 01:11:59,467
- Hani called, asked where you were.
- Jesus Christ.

990
01:11:59,633 --> 01:12:02,536
If you don't go back,
he's gonna wonder why you didn't go back.

991
01:12:02,705 --> 01:12:04,810
I think he likes you, buddy.
Change your ticket.

992
01:12:04,978 --> 01:12:07,823
- All right, Ed. I'm on my way.
- All right.

993
01:12:07,984 --> 01:12:10,635
- Oh, hey. Can I get that for you?
- Thank you.

994
01:12:17,871 --> 01:12:20,328
Mr. Ferris. Welcome.

995
01:12:20,495 --> 01:12:22,568
- Thank you.
- Come.

996
01:12:33,295 --> 01:12:38,030
I wanted to see you to tell you
I was sorry how we left things.

997
01:12:38,481 --> 01:12:41,795
- I was upset.
- Well, you had every right to be upset, sir.

998
01:12:41,968 --> 01:12:43,724
I apologize for what happened.

999
01:12:44,718 --> 01:12:46,694
But I am happy you are back.

1000
01:12:47,471 --> 01:12:49,839
Miss Aisha, too, I think,
will be happy you are back.

1001
01:12:50,671 --> 01:12:54,762
Don't worry, we're not watching you.
We're watching out for you.

1002
01:12:55,471 --> 01:12:58,952
But I need you to understand, you
cannot afford any more mistakes in Jordan.

1003
01:12:59,949 --> 01:13:03,048
This is a part of the world
where friendship matters.

1004
01:13:03,822 --> 01:13:05,677
It can save your life.

1005
01:13:05,871 --> 01:13:09,614
Why don't I call you back in about
15 minutes with all the information?

1006
01:13:09,773 --> 01:13:11,944
Well, thanks so much, Mr. Sadiki.

1007
01:13:13,005 --> 01:13:14,794
Let's get something clear, all right?

1008
01:13:14,959 --> 01:13:16,997
I'm not tolerating any more
of your bullshit.

1009
01:13:17,166 --> 01:13:19,107
- No, it's cool.
- Who do you work for?

1010
01:13:19,278 --> 01:13:22,244
-I work for you.I got the call,I got briefed.
-All right, good.

1011
01:13:22,415 --> 01:13:24,900
- Front? Back?
- Take my bag.

1012
01:13:35,726 --> 01:13:40,165
If you're going to insist on coming here
to see me...

1013
01:13:40,333 --> 01:13:42,667
...which is what you're doing...

1014
01:13:42,829 --> 01:13:46,277
...my sister's going to
want to meet you.

1015
01:13:47,885 --> 01:13:49,379
Your sister?

1016
01:13:49,547 --> 01:13:54,020
Yeah, my sister looks after me
in matters that are non-medical.

1017
01:13:56,044 --> 01:14:00,168
Oh, so she has to approve of me
before you will begin to.

1018
01:14:01,421 --> 01:14:04,966
I would like her to think so,
whenever I can.

1019
01:14:07,196 --> 01:14:08,177
Okay.

1020
01:14:41,722 --> 01:14:43,347
- Hi.
- Hi.

1021
01:14:43,515 --> 01:14:44,791
I'm still cooking.

1022
01:14:44,954 --> 01:14:47,539
- Come in.
- I brought some dessert, pastry.

1023
01:14:47,706 --> 01:14:49,778
Oh, the kids are going to love it.

1024
01:14:49,945 --> 01:14:51,026
- The kids?
- Yeah.

1025
01:14:51,194 --> 01:14:53,615
- Aha.
- Come.

1026
01:14:55,898 --> 01:14:58,996
This is my sister, Cala.

1027
01:15:00,601 --> 01:15:01,583
Mr. Ferris.

1028
01:15:02,969 --> 01:15:07,128
And these are my nephews,
Yousef and Rowley.

1029
01:15:07,288 --> 01:15:08,751
Hello.

1030
01:15:08,920 --> 01:15:10,415
Yousef. Rowley. Hey.

1031
01:15:10,585 --> 01:15:11,926
Hi.
Hi.

1032
01:15:12,088 --> 01:15:14,544
- Nephews.
- Yeah, my nephews.

1033
01:15:20,441 --> 01:15:22,611
Smells good in there, huh?

1034
01:15:22,778 --> 01:15:24,718
It's not good.

1035
01:15:27,514 --> 01:15:28,822
It's not good?

1036
01:15:28,985 --> 01:15:31,832
- You don't like your mother's cooking?
- No, not really.

1037
01:15:32,152 --> 01:15:33,135
Oh.

1038
01:15:39,225 --> 01:15:41,263
What kind of food do you like?

1039
01:15:41,431 --> 01:15:42,860
Hamburgers.

1040
01:15:43,032 --> 01:15:45,170
- You?
- Spaghettis.

1041
01:15:45,336 --> 01:15:46,961
Me too.

1042
01:15:47,128 --> 01:15:51,088
So if there's anything that I wouldn't like,
would you two let me know?

1043
01:15:52,919 --> 01:15:54,128
- Okay.
- Yeah.

1044
01:15:54,296 --> 01:15:55,309
Cool.

1045
01:16:08,053 --> 01:16:11,119
So, Mr. Ferris...

1046
01:16:11,639 --> 01:16:13,679
...how long are you in Amman?

1047
01:16:14,422 --> 01:16:15,436
Oh, uh, ahem.

1048
01:16:15,606 --> 01:16:19,403
Well, I think I'm gonna be for a while.
I hope so, anyway.

1049
01:16:22,005 --> 01:16:24,145
Where were you stationed before?

1050
01:16:25,526 --> 01:16:26,540
Riyadh.

1051
01:16:27,541 --> 01:16:28,688
- Riyadh?
Hm.

1052
01:16:33,173 --> 01:16:35,475
What do you do exactly?

1053
01:16:35,701 --> 01:16:39,596
I told you, Cala, he's a political adviser.

1054
01:16:39,765 --> 01:16:41,742
Political adviser.

1055
01:16:41,909 --> 01:16:44,974
But what does that mean?
Forgive my ignorance.

1056
01:16:45,141 --> 01:16:47,793
- It means, uh...
- It means that I...

1057
01:16:47,956 --> 01:16:52,496
Well, I offer my assistance to
His Majesty's advisers whenever they ask.

1058
01:16:58,132 --> 01:17:00,979
But you do this now, not before the war.

1059
01:17:01,140 --> 01:17:03,857
Before you didn't consult with us at all.

1060
01:17:04,020 --> 01:17:07,151
- Cala, please, we are just having lunch.
- It's okay.

1061
01:17:07,317 --> 01:17:08,626
- It's okay.
We can talk...

1062
01:17:08,788 --> 01:17:11,537
- I'm talking with your friend.
Talk about another subject.

1063
01:17:11,700 --> 01:17:13,391
It's quite all right. I understand.

1064
01:17:13,556 --> 01:17:16,752
And we understand
that the situation in Iraq...

1065
01:17:16,916 --> 01:17:20,844
...has created many hardships
for the Jordanian people.

1066
01:17:21,491 --> 01:17:23,402
- The situation?
- You mean, the war.

1067
01:17:23,571 --> 01:17:25,960
- He means war.
- No, no, no, he says the situation.

1068
01:17:26,132 --> 01:17:27,757
- What do you mean?
You know what...

1069
01:17:27,923 --> 01:17:29,134
Please.

1070
01:17:29,298 --> 01:17:33,074
I mean the roadside bombings,
the assassination of Iraqi police...

1071
01:17:33,236 --> 01:17:35,602
...the kidnappings,
the crowded marketplaces...

1072
01:17:35,762 --> 01:17:38,991
...and innocent families that have
been wiped off the face of the Earth.

1073
01:17:39,155 --> 01:17:41,392
That's what I mean
by the situation in Iraq.

1074
01:17:45,266 --> 01:17:47,983
I can tell you what
His Majesty's thinking.

1075
01:17:49,074 --> 01:17:52,390
His Majesty believes the best hope
for the war is that it ends.

1076
01:17:52,946 --> 01:17:55,336
Well, I can tell you
that is my hope as well.

1077
01:17:55,985 --> 01:17:57,895
I hope so too. Huh?

1078
01:17:58,066 --> 01:18:01,841
Cala? Hey. Peace.

1079
01:18:02,002 --> 01:18:04,587
- Let's have lunch, huh?
Okay.

1080
01:18:04,754 --> 01:18:06,216
Enjoy.

1081
01:18:06,386 --> 01:18:07,880
Thank you.

1082
01:18:10,961 --> 01:18:13,351
- Well, sorry about that.
- Ah, so am I.

1083
01:18:13,521 --> 01:18:17,033
I probably should've kept my mouth shut.
After all, I was a guest in your home.

1084
01:18:17,201 --> 01:18:19,340
So is she. It didn't stop her, you know?

1085
01:18:19,505 --> 01:18:22,700
She suffered a lot during Iran-Iraq war.

1086
01:18:22,865 --> 01:18:26,726
And the funny thing
is that she wants to live in America.

1087
01:18:26,896 --> 01:18:27,912
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

1088
01:18:28,080 --> 01:18:31,277
Well, tell her I'll switch passports with her.
It'll make us both happy.

1089
01:18:31,441 --> 01:18:33,264
Don't joke about these kind of things.

1090
01:18:33,424 --> 01:18:37,995
I'm not joking. I'm perfectly serious.
I may stay here forever. Really.

1091
01:18:39,568 --> 01:18:42,701
Well, anyway, I'm glad I made friends
with her boys. I like them a lot.

1092
01:18:42,864 --> 01:18:44,621
Yeah, they're great, aren't they?

1093
01:18:44,783 --> 01:18:47,881
But not very good spies, you know?
Neither are you.

1094
01:18:48,049 --> 01:18:49,032
What do you mean?

1095
01:18:49,199 --> 01:18:50,608
- At the table, you know?
- Oh.

1096
01:18:51,345 --> 01:18:54,062
So you noticed. All right. I'm busted.

1097
01:18:54,226 --> 01:18:57,094
Well, thank you, Aisha,
for inviting me in your home.

1098
01:18:57,744 --> 01:18:58,792
Um...

1099
01:19:04,336 --> 01:19:05,928
Sorry.

1100
01:19:06,704 --> 01:19:08,809
- I had a really nice time.
- Sorry. Yeah, me too.

1101
01:19:09,647 --> 01:19:12,712
- Thank you for coming.
- Thank you.

1102
01:19:22,415 --> 01:19:26,440
The photograph was taken last week
in the Cyclone Club in Dubai.

1103
01:19:26,606 --> 01:19:28,133
One is Al-Masri, a lawyer...

1104
01:19:28,304 --> 01:19:33,036
...a low-level al Qaeda financier,
if that's not a contradiction in terms.

1105
01:19:33,199 --> 01:19:35,533
The other is a Jordanian.

1106
01:19:35,694 --> 01:19:38,281
An architect named Omar Sadiki.

1107
01:19:39,501 --> 01:19:41,128
No known terrorist ties.

1108
01:19:41,294 --> 01:19:46,922
Now, the question I ask myself is,
is what are they doing together?

1109
01:19:51,598 --> 01:19:54,466
Is this Sadiki more than
he claims to be?

1110
01:19:55,055 --> 01:19:56,166
He travels a lot.

1111
01:19:56,589 --> 01:19:59,404
He builds mosques
and shopping malls.

1112
01:19:59,564 --> 01:20:02,379
At the very least,
he bears examination by us.

1113
01:20:02,542 --> 01:20:04,450
Or by we.

1114
01:20:04,877 --> 01:20:06,251
Hm.

1115
01:20:07,821 --> 01:20:09,030
Where'd you get these?

1116
01:20:09,997 --> 01:20:12,168
- A friend in Saudi Intelligence.
- Mm.

1117
01:20:12,845 --> 01:20:14,218
Useful friend, huh?

1118
01:20:23,020 --> 01:20:24,394
No, keep it.

1119
01:20:25,037 --> 01:20:27,010
I want you to have it.

1120
01:20:27,180 --> 01:20:30,409
We are partners. Allies, no?

1121
01:20:31,404 --> 01:20:34,121
Why would we not want
to help each other?

1122
01:20:34,284 --> 01:20:37,250
Right. Thank you.

1123
01:20:37,706 --> 01:20:39,400
Garland.
Yeah?

1124
01:20:39,564 --> 01:20:42,498
Pull up an Arabic keyboard
and write down this message, you ready?

1125
01:20:42,667 --> 01:20:43,649
Okay.

1126
01:20:43,819 --> 01:20:46,186
In the name of Go...
No, you know what, strike that.

1127
01:20:46,349 --> 01:20:48,649
In the name of God the merciful...

1128
01:20:48,812 --> 01:20:51,201
...we praise our brothers
who shall carry out...

1129
01:20:51,371 --> 01:20:53,640
...this heroic act in the fig orchard...

1130
01:20:53,803 --> 01:20:56,771
...and beg God to give us strength
for our continuing struggle.

1131
01:20:56,939 --> 01:20:59,078
The time is at hand. All right?

1132
01:20:59,242 --> 01:21:03,039
Now, that's absolutely delightful Arabic,
but what the fuck is the fig orchard?

1133
01:21:03,213 --> 01:21:06,059
I can't let you in on that yet.
Let's just say it's developing.

1134
01:21:06,221 --> 01:21:07,364
It'll create chatter...

1135
01:21:07,531 --> 01:21:10,847
...but it's gotta be big enough
for Al-Saleem, to get his attention.

1136
01:21:11,276 --> 01:21:12,387
Oh, it'll be big.

1137
01:21:12,554 --> 01:21:15,272
Now, send that off
from Sadiki's fake e-mail address...

1138
01:21:15,436 --> 01:21:17,028
...and we are in business.

1139
01:21:17,194 --> 01:21:18,406
Okay. Done.

1140
01:21:31,433 --> 01:21:33,475
Advise when you're on the deck.

1141
01:21:44,009 --> 01:21:46,855
Hello there, Mr. Sadiki.
It's Brad Scanlon.

1142
01:21:47,019 --> 01:21:50,531
I'm fine. Thanks so much for asking.
But we've got a bit of a problem.

1143
01:21:50,697 --> 01:21:53,379
You see, our chief engineer,
who's based out of Ankara...

1144
01:21:53,545 --> 01:21:56,960
...he's raised some issues
about the insulation.

1145
01:21:57,129 --> 01:21:59,811
I realize it's the same stuff
that you use in Saudi Arabia...

1146
01:21:59,977 --> 01:22:03,391
...but he's asked
to meet with you immediately.

1147
01:22:03,560 --> 01:22:06,374
No, I'm sorry, sir.
He cannot fly up to see you.

1148
01:22:06,537 --> 01:22:09,602
And the only time he can meet
is tomorrow afternoon.

1149
01:22:09,767 --> 01:22:13,509
But the good news is, we have a car
ready to pick you up in about...

1150
01:22:13,672 --> 01:22:18,144
...oh, six hours, and a plane ticket to Turkey
waiting for you at the airport.

1151
01:22:18,920 --> 01:22:21,767
No, I'm sorry, sir.
First class was not available.

1152
01:22:22,824 --> 01:22:24,930
Ed, Sadiki just landed in Turkey.

1153
01:22:25,096 --> 01:22:26,853
He's being met by one of our guys.

1154
01:22:27,015 --> 01:22:30,397
An engineer to discuss business
and to show him a good time.

1155
01:22:30,568 --> 01:22:32,901
All we need is to establish
that he is there.

1156
01:22:33,096 --> 01:22:35,005
- Mm-hm.
- Now, the barracks at the base...

1157
01:22:35,175 --> 01:22:37,062
...have been cleared out
of all personnel.

1158
01:22:37,224 --> 01:22:39,230
Bodies from the morgue
have been brought in.

1159
01:22:39,399 --> 01:22:42,183
They'll be our so-called casualties.

1160
01:22:42,343 --> 01:22:46,533
Now, Garland will send out a message from
Sadiki hinting that a strike is prepared.

1161
01:22:46,693 --> 01:22:48,036
And when the strike is done...

1162
01:22:48,200 --> 01:22:51,646
...he'll post another message taking
responsibility for our little event.

1163
01:22:51,814 --> 01:22:53,701
- You got that?
- Uh-huh.

1164
01:22:53,863 --> 01:22:55,072
After that...

1165
01:22:55,239 --> 01:22:58,783
...hopefully a buzz of messages
will then pass among jihadists' networks...

1166
01:22:58,951 --> 01:23:02,878
...announcing the Brothers of Awareness
as a new player.

1167
01:23:03,047 --> 01:23:05,598
And our Sadiki as its leader.
You got that?

1168
01:23:05,766 --> 01:23:07,360
All right, Ferris. Thank you.

1169
01:23:07,527 --> 01:23:08,836
Tony, you have a go.

1170
01:23:15,974 --> 01:23:17,663
We have a special report.

1171
01:23:17,830 --> 01:23:20,763
A massive explosion
has taken place in Incirlik, Turkey.

1172
01:23:20,935 --> 01:23:23,932
Officials have confirmed the
target of the blast to be the U.S. Air Base...

1173
01:23:25,254 --> 01:23:28,799
...at Incirlik, Turkey. The bomb ripped
through the Bachelor Officers' Quarters...

1174
01:23:28,965 --> 01:23:31,037
...at 3:00 this morning,
quickly engulfing it in flames.

1175
01:23:32,516 --> 01:23:35,036
No one yet has claimed responsibility
for the attack.

1176
01:23:35,204 --> 01:23:38,752
But terror experts are already speculating
this is the work of a new...

1177
01:23:38,916 --> 01:23:42,365
...much more sophisticated and much
better financed offshoot of al Qaeda...

1178
01:23:42,533 --> 01:23:44,866
...than that which is responsible
for the bombings...

1179
01:23:45,028 --> 01:23:47,679
...in Amsterdam, London
and other European cities.

1180
01:23:47,843 --> 01:23:49,601
In contrast to these recent bombings...

1181
01:23:49,764 --> 01:23:53,080
...this is the first attack
to occur on American property.

1182
01:23:53,251 --> 01:23:54,461
- The Pentagon...
Honey.

1183
01:23:54,627 --> 01:23:58,010
...will not release the names of the dead
until notification of next of kin.

1184
01:23:58,182 --> 01:24:00,799
We're also being told that there
may never be a public announcement...

1185
01:24:00,963 --> 01:24:01,946
Honey.

1186
01:24:02,117 --> 01:24:04,156
...of the list of casualties
since some of the men killed...

1187
01:24:04,325 --> 01:24:07,073
...may have been stationed at Incirlik
on classified missions.

1188
01:24:07,234 --> 01:24:10,945
Incirlik, which in Turkish means fig orchard,
has served since September the 11 th...

1189
01:24:11,108 --> 01:24:14,423
...as a primary hub in the wars
in Afghanistan and Iraq.

1190
01:24:14,596 --> 01:24:17,912
All right, now send out the message
taking credit.

1191
01:24:18,084 --> 01:24:21,630
But make the responses go back
to Sadiki's actual account.

1192
01:24:21,794 --> 01:24:24,183
- You got that?
- Okay.

1193
01:24:28,963 --> 01:24:33,403
I can't say it's been real,
but you know what I mean.

1194
01:24:34,016 --> 01:24:35,032
Yeah.

1195
01:24:51,107 --> 01:24:54,903
AL-SALEEM

1196
01:25:25,158 --> 01:25:27,196
SADIKl:

1197
01:28:00,701 --> 01:28:02,326
Hey there, little buddy.

1198
01:28:02,846 --> 01:28:06,457
Well done. You did it.
NSA's picking up all kinds of chatter.

1199
01:28:06,622 --> 01:28:07,733
Haven't heard for years.

1200
01:28:07,901 --> 01:28:11,698
One voice on a world phone out of Vienna
sounds a lot like Al-Saleem himself.

1201
01:28:11,868 --> 01:28:15,253
Saying something along the lines of,
"Who the damn heck is Omar Sadiki?"

1202
01:28:15,421 --> 01:28:19,414
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Listen, I made
a decision, Ed. I'm bringing him in.

1203
01:28:19,580 --> 01:28:22,133
- Who?
- Omar Sadiki, that's who.

1204
01:28:22,300 --> 01:28:23,795
Oh, come on. No, no, no.

1205
01:28:23,966 --> 01:28:27,444
When they find him, they are gonna
torture him and they are gonna kill him.

1206
01:28:27,612 --> 01:28:31,158
You gotta decide which side of the cross
you're on. I need nailers, not hangers.

1207
01:28:31,325 --> 01:28:33,560
Decision's already done, Ed.
I'm bringing him in.

1208
01:28:33,724 --> 01:28:36,571
Ain't nobody innocent
in this shit, Ferris. Okay?

1209
01:28:37,756 --> 01:28:38,739
Ferris.

1210
01:28:39,548 --> 01:28:42,232
All right, don't move until
I say, all right?

1211
01:28:47,771 --> 01:28:49,180
You got me?

1212
01:28:55,611 --> 01:28:57,040
Omar.

1213
01:28:57,211 --> 01:28:59,861
It's Brad Scanlon.
We need to have a conversation. Come on.

1214
01:29:00,026 --> 01:29:01,849
What are you doing here?

1215
01:29:06,842 --> 01:29:09,778
Fuck! Omar! Omar, open the door!

1216
01:29:09,946 --> 01:29:10,960
Let's go!

1217
01:29:11,129 --> 01:29:13,401
Omar, listen to me!

1218
01:29:13,562 --> 01:29:15,091
Omar! Omar!

1219
01:29:15,739 --> 01:29:17,878
Let's go! Go, go, go!

1220
01:29:30,106 --> 01:29:31,535
Fuck!

1221
01:29:38,778 --> 01:29:41,528
This is Roger Ferris.
I need an ambulance.

1222
01:31:38,198 --> 01:31:39,888
Yeah.

1223
01:31:40,053 --> 01:31:42,093
Sadiki is dead.

1224
01:31:43,029 --> 01:31:44,623
You there?

1225
01:31:44,789 --> 01:31:46,098
Yeah, I'm here.

1226
01:31:46,260 --> 01:31:48,084
I didn't kill him, buddy.

1227
01:31:48,244 --> 01:31:49,356
I know you didn't, Ed.

1228
01:31:50,964 --> 01:31:52,427
I did.

1229
01:31:52,597 --> 01:31:56,044
Oh, buddy.
Buddy, that's just not constructive. Okay?

1230
01:31:56,212 --> 01:31:59,027
- Then what is?
- Doing exactly what you're doing.

1231
01:31:59,187 --> 01:32:02,799
And how are you measuring that? By how
much closer you've gotten to Al-Saleem?

1232
01:32:02,964 --> 01:32:06,096
I bet you heard a shitload of chatter,
then it stopped, didn't it?

1233
01:32:06,260 --> 01:32:07,503
That's right.

1234
01:32:07,667 --> 01:32:09,576
Well, then where is Al-Saleem?

1235
01:32:10,451 --> 01:32:12,818
- Hm?
- Ferris.

1236
01:32:13,490 --> 01:32:15,727
You know what? I've had it.

1237
01:32:15,890 --> 01:32:17,747
I've had it. I can't do this anymore.

1238
01:32:18,484 --> 01:32:19,466
Yes, you can.

1239
01:32:19,636 --> 01:32:22,157
Now, you just get yourself
a couple of hours' sleep.

1240
01:32:22,323 --> 01:32:24,145
And call me
when you're thinking straight.

1241
01:32:24,308 --> 01:32:28,083
You know what? I am thinking straight.
You're not, all right?

1242
01:32:28,243 --> 01:32:30,862
You can't, because you're
a million fucking miles away.

1243
01:32:31,026 --> 01:32:32,433
I'm here, Ed, every day.

1244
01:32:32,595 --> 01:32:34,831
And I see the unnecessary travesties
of this war...

1245
01:32:34,995 --> 01:32:38,289
...that the rest of you backstabbing
political fucking bureaucrats...

1246
01:32:38,449 --> 01:32:39,695
...only look at pictures of.

1247
01:32:39,858 --> 01:32:43,023
So don't you dare tell me
I am not fucking thinking straight!

1248
01:32:45,043 --> 01:32:46,635
This is not working, all right?

1249
01:32:46,802 --> 01:32:48,777
It's not working. I'm out.

1250
01:32:48,946 --> 01:32:50,854
Ferris?

1251
01:32:51,026 --> 01:32:52,935
Ferris?

1252
01:32:56,083 --> 01:32:58,023
I should pack.

1253
01:33:15,794 --> 01:33:17,767
Fuck.

1254
01:33:23,087 --> 01:33:24,614
Fuck!

1255
01:33:43,183 --> 01:33:44,679
Shit!

1256
01:33:45,326 --> 01:33:47,238
Move the fucking car!

1257
01:34:52,173 --> 01:34:53,832
- Where's Marwan? Marwan?
Mr. Ferris.

1258
01:34:53,997 --> 01:34:55,491
Please.

1259
01:34:56,878 --> 01:34:59,527
Please, please. I just need
a moment of his time, all right?

1260
01:34:59,694 --> 01:35:01,415
Okay.

1261
01:35:06,891 --> 01:35:08,354
Please?

1262
01:35:10,028 --> 01:35:11,884
Please excuse me.

1263
01:35:18,477 --> 01:35:20,168
What is it?

1264
01:35:26,189 --> 01:35:29,089
I invented Omar Sadiki.

1265
01:35:29,261 --> 01:35:32,294
It was my operation.
He is not a jihadist, all right?

1266
01:35:32,462 --> 01:35:36,386
I moved him around, I moved money around,
and then I lost him.

1267
01:35:36,554 --> 01:35:38,857
- That is impossible.
- Why?

1268
01:35:39,020 --> 01:35:42,913
Because it will mean that you sat
in my office and you lied to my face.

1269
01:35:43,084 --> 01:35:46,728
Hani, I promise I will share
all the information with you, all right?

1270
01:35:46,891 --> 01:35:50,088
But they have kidnapped a friend of mine
in order to get to me.

1271
01:35:50,249 --> 01:35:52,551
Now, you know exactly
who I'm talking about, Hani.

1272
01:35:52,716 --> 01:35:56,010
Please, they're gonna execute her,
all right?

1273
01:35:56,169 --> 01:35:58,536
Please, help me broker a deal, her for me.

1274
01:35:58,699 --> 01:36:00,588
You lied to me.

1275
01:36:00,746 --> 01:36:02,153
I will not help you.

1276
01:36:02,315 --> 01:36:04,519
- The answer is no.
- Please, Hani.

1277
01:36:04,683 --> 01:36:07,049
Hani. Hani!

1278
01:36:25,063 --> 01:36:26,439
Ed.

1279
01:36:26,601 --> 01:36:29,448
You should've told me about the girl.
We could've watched her.

1280
01:36:29,608 --> 01:36:31,432
They left the phone.
I know how this goes.

1281
01:36:31,594 --> 01:36:33,633
They've got Aisha
and they want someone.

1282
01:36:33,801 --> 01:36:37,413
- If she's alive.
- She has to be alive, right?

1283
01:36:37,864 --> 01:36:40,831
Well, she's probably alive.
At least, they want you to think so.

1284
01:36:41,002 --> 01:36:43,106
- That's the good part.
- And what's the bad part?

1285
01:36:43,271 --> 01:36:44,678
They know about you.

1286
01:36:44,840 --> 01:36:47,839
They know you work for the agency.
That tells me two things.

1287
01:36:48,007 --> 01:36:50,430
One, the people that have Aisha
are running the show...

1288
01:36:50,601 --> 01:36:52,062
...so they're close to Al-Saleem.

1289
01:36:52,231 --> 01:36:55,168
Two, they have learned enough
from Aisha to know she's your pal.

1290
01:36:55,337 --> 01:36:57,225
- She's been interrogated.
- Goddamn it.

1291
01:36:57,385 --> 01:36:59,688
- You cannot take this to Hani, right?
- Right. Right.

1292
01:36:59,848 --> 01:37:03,297
- Does that mean you already have?
- Yes. Yes, sir, I have.

1293
01:37:03,463 --> 01:37:04,445
Why would you do that?

1294
01:37:04,617 --> 01:37:06,438
I have to trust everyone I can right now.

1295
01:37:06,600 --> 01:37:08,901
All you gotta do is trust me.

1296
01:37:09,416 --> 01:37:10,791
- What'd he say?
- He said, "Ma'alesh. "

1297
01:37:10,952 --> 01:37:12,839
Because I lied to him,
he's not gonna help.

1298
01:37:20,391 --> 01:37:22,693
Okay. We set this up,
we're gonna do it right.

1299
01:37:22,855 --> 01:37:25,789
-It's not just about you and your girlfriend.
-All right.

1300
01:37:27,973 --> 01:37:31,618
This is Roger Ferris.
Will you put Aisha on the phone?

1301
01:37:31,784 --> 01:37:34,500
Okay, mister. Thanks God you are calling.

1302
01:37:34,663 --> 01:37:37,859
I have a question
to make sure you are you. Please.

1303
01:37:38,022 --> 01:37:39,005
Fine.

1304
01:37:39,175 --> 01:37:41,314
Where do you meet
Miss Aisha first time?

1305
01:37:41,478 --> 01:37:45,886
At a medical clinic in Amman.
She's a nurse.

1306
01:37:46,054 --> 01:37:48,869
Where do you take Miss Aisha
for dinner first time?

1307
01:37:49,030 --> 01:37:50,754
Go, go.

1308
01:37:50,951 --> 01:37:52,227
Uh...

1309
01:37:52,390 --> 01:37:56,164
I didn't. She invited me
to her apartment for dinner.

1310
01:37:56,326 --> 01:37:57,755
Did you bring anything?

1311
01:37:59,430 --> 01:38:01,090
I did.

1312
01:38:01,862 --> 01:38:04,512
A dessert pastry.

1313
01:38:04,677 --> 01:38:07,645
If you want to see Miss Aisha,
you must go where I say.

1314
01:38:08,263 --> 01:38:12,058
Trade you for her.
No trick or Miss Aisha will die.

1315
01:38:12,230 --> 01:38:13,757
Tell me where I'm to go.

1316
01:38:14,213 --> 01:38:15,708
I'll tell you where to go.

1317
01:38:15,876 --> 01:38:18,691
It is near the border. Highway 15.

1318
01:38:18,852 --> 01:38:21,755
Between Al-Saidi and Mahbrouk.

1319
01:38:21,924 --> 01:38:23,680
That's where you go. Bye.

1320
01:39:00,387 --> 01:39:01,697
Passport.

1321
01:40:49,599 --> 01:40:50,745
Bring up Pacman feed.

1322
01:40:50,911 --> 01:40:52,568
Increase magnification eight time.

1323
01:40:52,736 --> 01:40:54,709
Eight-time mag.

1324
01:40:55,710 --> 01:40:56,824
Enhance resolution.

1325
01:41:13,790 --> 01:41:17,106
Holding at mid-altitude orbit,
12,500...

1326
01:41:26,142 --> 01:41:27,964
Still holding for vector angle.

1327
01:41:38,684 --> 01:41:41,270
Still holding for vector angle.
Switching over to SAR.

1328
01:42:03,035 --> 01:42:04,760
Which one do you want us to follow?

1329
01:42:08,925 --> 01:42:10,332
Which one, sir?

1330
01:42:11,578 --> 01:42:13,586
Sir?

1331
01:42:13,754 --> 01:42:15,665
Sorry, buddy.

1332
01:43:41,625 --> 01:43:44,885
Salaam, CIA.

1333
01:43:49,079 --> 01:43:50,510
I am not the sheik.

1334
01:43:50,680 --> 01:43:53,910
The sheik, God praise him,
is the sheik who always was.

1335
01:43:54,072 --> 01:43:55,794
I am his servant.

1336
01:43:57,623 --> 01:43:59,762
Where is the girl?

1337
01:44:00,567 --> 01:44:02,160
Either you're trying to be clever...

1338
01:44:02,328 --> 01:44:06,287
...or someone has done to you
what you so often do to them.

1339
01:44:06,453 --> 01:44:08,212
Lie.

1340
01:44:08,918 --> 01:44:11,155
So you paid for me? Hm?

1341
01:44:11,320 --> 01:44:12,879
Not as much as I would have.

1342
01:44:13,463 --> 01:44:16,627
Such a bargain for
such a catch as you.

1343
01:44:16,791 --> 01:44:21,045
Well, it wasn't a bargain, because
no one's gonna negotiate with you for me.

1344
01:44:21,206 --> 01:44:24,818
That's not our policy. There will be
no exchanges. You understand that, right?

1345
01:44:24,983 --> 01:44:28,461
There will be no negotiation,
but not because you say so.

1346
01:44:29,237 --> 01:44:31,824
I have an agent of the CIA.

1347
01:44:32,374 --> 01:44:36,629
And that's what I came to see.
And that's what matters.

1348
01:44:37,975 --> 01:44:39,185
In this world...

1349
01:44:39,348 --> 01:44:44,236
...there's enough poverty and frustration
and anger and passion.

1350
01:44:44,407 --> 01:44:47,055
There will never be a shortage of martyrs.

1351
01:44:47,799 --> 01:44:51,278
Just like these men, huh?
These men who are dispensable to you.

1352
01:44:51,446 --> 01:44:54,708
These men who blow themselves up
in the name of Allah...

1353
01:44:54,869 --> 01:44:57,291
...who kill their own
brothers and sisters, huh?

1354
01:44:57,461 --> 01:45:01,291
There is no place in the Koran for
the murder of innocent people and suicide.

1355
01:45:01,461 --> 01:45:03,501
- You know that.
- It's a good try.

1356
01:45:03,927 --> 01:45:08,398
But the Koran's sayings...
You speak Arabic, no?

1357
01:45:18,548 --> 01:45:22,322
So you misinterpret the one book
you believe in, hm?

1358
01:45:22,740 --> 01:45:24,268
But are you pure...

1359
01:45:24,436 --> 01:45:28,691
...or are you just as corrupt as
the capitalist Westerners that you despise?

1360
01:45:28,852 --> 01:45:30,861
To me, you are fucking slaves.

1361
01:45:31,026 --> 01:45:34,921
You're slaves to the Saudi oil sheiks
and the Wahabi oil money that funds you.

1362
01:45:35,092 --> 01:45:37,131
And when that oil money runs out,
my friends...

1363
01:45:37,299 --> 01:45:41,259
...you will all fucking disappear
into the ashes of history.

1364
01:45:41,427 --> 01:45:44,361
I am not going
to torture you, Mr. Ferris.

1365
01:45:44,532 --> 01:45:48,623
I see you're not going to read
what is prepared for you on paper.

1366
01:45:48,786 --> 01:45:49,769
It's all right.

1367
01:45:50,481 --> 01:45:54,093
All I need from you, I already have.

1368
01:45:54,258 --> 01:45:56,681
You know what that camera is for?

1369
01:45:57,234 --> 01:46:00,650
It's not for this. This...
This is intermission.

1370
01:46:01,299 --> 01:46:06,862
It's for what comes after this.
For what comes now.

1371
01:46:15,988 --> 01:46:17,361
Kareem.

1372
01:46:18,227 --> 01:46:20,134
But you paid who for me?

1373
01:46:20,307 --> 01:46:22,891
An intermediary who works for who?

1374
01:46:23,056 --> 01:46:25,514
You don't know who
and that should concern you.

1375
01:46:25,682 --> 01:46:28,616
- Do I look concerned?
- Well, that's what surprises me.

1376
01:46:28,786 --> 01:46:30,957
I thought you were
a lot smarter than that.

1377
01:46:31,602 --> 01:46:35,049
Someone has betrayed you.

1378
01:46:35,216 --> 01:46:37,552
He works for the head
of Jordanian Intelligence...

1379
01:46:37,714 --> 01:46:39,405
...which means he works for us...

1380
01:46:39,569 --> 01:46:45,353
...which means...
Which means you work for us.

1381
01:46:47,409 --> 01:46:50,408
I work for you.

1382
01:47:01,071 --> 01:47:02,088
Are you comfortable?

1383
01:47:02,768 --> 01:47:04,557
Can I make you...

1384
01:47:04,721 --> 01:47:07,020
...more comfortable?

1385
01:47:12,912 --> 01:47:15,596
I'm not lying to you, Kareem.
I'm not lying to you.

1386
01:47:16,591 --> 01:47:20,073
We know... We know where you are!

1387
01:47:21,294 --> 01:47:23,238
Where am I?

1388
01:47:23,406 --> 01:47:26,254
You... You... You are in the light.

1389
01:47:26,416 --> 01:47:29,196
The light is on you. Look at it.

1390
01:47:30,223 --> 01:47:31,978
No, no, no.

1391
01:47:32,142 --> 01:47:35,688
The light...
The light is on you, motherfucker.

1392
01:47:40,783 --> 01:47:43,170
What do you think is happening here,
Mr. Ferris?

1393
01:47:43,344 --> 01:47:45,709
Do you think the cavalry
is coming for you?

1394
01:47:46,799 --> 01:47:48,489
Let's wait.

1395
01:47:50,509 --> 01:47:52,997
Nobody's coming for you.

1396
01:47:53,165 --> 01:47:55,173
Welcome to Guantanamo.

1397
01:47:58,030 --> 01:48:00,168
God! Fuck!

1398
01:50:46,920 --> 01:50:48,828
You can tell who cares
about you the most...

1399
01:50:48,999 --> 01:50:51,782
...by who comes first
to visit you in the hospital.

1400
01:50:51,942 --> 01:50:54,399
And I believe I am the first.

1401
01:50:54,567 --> 01:50:57,121
That is not difficult,
because nobody knows where you are.

1402
01:50:57,286 --> 01:50:58,781
Yeah.

1403
01:50:58,950 --> 01:51:00,860
And where am I, Hani?

1404
01:51:01,030 --> 01:51:03,006
You're home, in Amman.

1405
01:51:05,414 --> 01:51:10,052
So it was your man I spoke to
on the phone...

1406
01:51:10,919 --> 01:51:13,821
...your men who took Aisha...

1407
01:51:13,990 --> 01:51:16,576
...your men who dropped me off
in the desert.

1408
01:51:16,742 --> 01:51:19,646
I was of some assistance, I admit.

1409
01:51:19,814 --> 01:51:23,426
But it was not me
that picked you up in the desert.

1410
01:51:23,591 --> 01:51:25,052
Edward could not find you.

1411
01:51:25,606 --> 01:51:29,054
Not with all his aircraft,
all his people, all his money...

1412
01:51:29,223 --> 01:51:31,741
...and joie de vivre.

1413
01:51:31,909 --> 01:51:34,048
So how, I wonder, did I do it?

1414
01:51:34,213 --> 01:51:37,529
- Karami.
- Very good. You remember him?

1415
01:51:37,702 --> 01:51:42,076
Yes, I remember him, Hani.
He was in the fucking room with me.

1416
01:51:42,245 --> 01:51:45,890
He was in the room
because I put him there.

1417
01:51:46,053 --> 01:51:48,387
I'm just sorry
I wasn't there a few minutes sooner.

1418
01:51:48,548 --> 01:51:51,898
Right. What would've happened if
you were a few minutes later, Hani?

1419
01:51:52,069 --> 01:51:54,654
- Then I shudder to think.
- No, I shudder to think.

1420
01:51:56,516 --> 01:51:59,777
How badly did you hurt Aisha
when you took her, huh?

1421
01:51:59,941 --> 01:52:02,362
- That's what I wanna know.
- Aisha, not at all.

1422
01:52:03,494 --> 01:52:05,979
The room we messed up
after we took her.

1423
01:52:06,147 --> 01:52:07,806
Bullshit, Hani, bullshit!

1424
01:52:07,972 --> 01:52:10,819
All right. We tested that blood!
All right? It was hers!

1425
01:52:10,979 --> 01:52:13,500
She is a nurse.
She gives blood every month.

1426
01:52:13,667 --> 01:52:16,089
Now, please, let go of the jacket.
Thank you.

1427
01:52:18,149 --> 01:52:21,376
You're trying to tell me
you didn't tell her, Hani?

1428
01:52:21,539 --> 01:52:24,637
I told her what I could,
which I admit was not very much...

1429
01:52:24,804 --> 01:52:27,104
...because these are matters
of state security.

1430
01:52:27,267 --> 01:52:29,439
So she doesn't know anything
about what happened?

1431
01:52:29,604 --> 01:52:32,472
She knows what everybody
who knows me knows.

1432
01:52:32,644 --> 01:52:36,506
That I am an exceedingly polite gentleman
and a very good conversationalist.

1433
01:52:36,674 --> 01:52:38,082
Huh.

1434
01:52:38,851 --> 01:52:41,700
If I may be so fucking
impolite, Hani...

1435
01:52:41,858 --> 01:52:44,379
...I almost died
in that goddamn room.

1436
01:52:44,545 --> 01:52:48,027
And if you had died, I would have
told her what you did for her.

1437
01:52:48,195 --> 01:52:52,220
And she...
She would have loved you forever.

1438
01:52:52,866 --> 01:52:56,095
Whereas now you are going
to have to earn that right.

1439
01:52:56,739 --> 01:52:59,128
That's great news.

1440
01:53:01,505 --> 01:53:03,449
Fantastic work, Hani.

1441
01:53:03,618 --> 01:53:05,559
Really. Excellent.

1442
01:53:06,529 --> 01:53:08,602
So you now have Al-Saleem, right?

1443
01:53:09,410 --> 01:53:11,197
That was the plan, my dear.

1444
01:53:12,930 --> 01:53:16,475
And I presume he's not giving you
any information.

1445
01:53:16,640 --> 01:53:18,136
Not yet.

1446
01:53:29,633 --> 01:53:31,672
Your work's done here, buddy.

1447
01:53:32,097 --> 01:53:34,398
You're gonna come back.
I got you a corner office...

1448
01:53:34,560 --> 01:53:36,600
...just down the hall from mine.

1449
01:53:36,769 --> 01:53:39,900
As soon as I get the guy who's in it
out of it, it's all yours.

1450
01:53:40,066 --> 01:53:42,203
More money, a fancy title.

1451
01:53:42,370 --> 01:53:46,012
No sunscreen, no couscous,
unless you really want it.

1452
01:53:46,175 --> 01:53:49,753
- Right down the hall from you, huh, Ed?
- Right down the hall from me.

1453
01:53:49,921 --> 01:53:53,848
Well, I think we both know you'd be
more comfortable without me there.

1454
01:53:54,559 --> 01:53:57,374
Now, don't think about it too long,
because I'll take that as a slight.

1455
01:53:57,536 --> 01:53:58,878
Hm.

1456
01:53:59,040 --> 01:54:03,417
Besides, what else are you gonna do?
Stay here?

1457
01:54:03,585 --> 01:54:06,485
Maybe for a little while, huh?
I mean, why wouldn't I?

1458
01:54:06,655 --> 01:54:08,597
Why would you?

1459
01:54:08,865 --> 01:54:10,837
What if I like the Middle East?

1460
01:54:12,319 --> 01:54:15,963
Ain't nobody likes the Middle East, buddy.
There's nothing here to like.

1461
01:54:16,416 --> 01:54:17,910
Hmm.

1462
01:54:18,302 --> 01:54:21,269
Well, maybe that's the problem right there,
isn't it, Ed?

1463
01:54:22,717 --> 01:54:24,027
Hm.

1464
01:54:24,351 --> 01:54:26,293
Oh, buddy, buddy, buddy.

1465
01:54:26,462 --> 01:54:30,455
You know, you're the best I got.

1466
01:54:30,623 --> 01:54:32,281
And you know it hurts me to say that.

1467
01:54:35,165 --> 01:54:38,100
Good luck on winning this war, Ed.

1468
01:54:38,270 --> 01:54:41,848
I hope everyone thinks
you did it all by yourself, huh?

1469
01:54:46,942 --> 01:54:48,765
You're not safe here.

1470
01:54:48,926 --> 01:54:50,616
I'm not safe anywhere.

1471
01:54:50,782 --> 01:54:52,789
You walk out on me,
you know what that means.

1472
01:54:52,958 --> 01:54:54,779
What does that mean?

1473
01:54:55,805 --> 01:54:57,659
That means you're giving up
on America.

1474
01:54:58,301 --> 01:55:01,750
Just be careful calling yourself
America, huh, Ed?

1475
01:55:02,590 --> 01:55:07,062
Listen, you have a safe flight home.
Say hey to the wife and kids.

1476
01:55:07,229 --> 01:55:09,531
Nobody's innocent in
this shit, Ferris.

1477
01:56:26,233 --> 01:56:27,214
What's he doing?

1478
01:56:27,385 --> 01:56:29,045
Nothing. Buying vegetables.

1479
01:56:30,137 --> 01:56:32,920
What about us, sir?
What do you want us to do?

1480
01:56:33,081 --> 01:56:34,608
Are we staying with him?

1481
01:56:34,777 --> 01:56:37,527
No. Buddy's done.

1482
01:56:37,689 --> 01:56:39,184
He's all by himself.

1483
01:56:39,353 --> 01:56:42,582
Copy that. Cleared off target.

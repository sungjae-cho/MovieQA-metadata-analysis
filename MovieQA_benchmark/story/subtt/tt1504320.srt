1
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:41,260
You're live in two minutes,
Your Royal Highness.

2
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:44,600
Sir?

3
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:50,600
Thank you.

4
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,650
Let the microphone do the work, sir.

5
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:02,700
I'm sure you'll be splendid.
Just take your time.

6
00:02:14,131 --> 00:02:15,171
Time to go.

7
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:24,511
Good afternoon.

8
00:02:24,601 --> 00:02:28,521
"This is the BBC National Program
and Empire Service...

9
00:02:28,601 --> 00:02:31,811
...taking you to Wembley Stadium
for the closing ceremony...

10
00:02:31,901 --> 00:02:33,811
...Of the Empire Exhibition.

11
00:02:33,901 --> 00:02:36,821
...Where His Royal Highness,
the Duke of York,...

12
00:02:36,901 --> 00:02:41,781
...will read a message from his father;
His Majesty King George V."

13
00:02:41,871 --> 00:02:45,161
"Fifty eight British colonies
and dominions have taken part,...

14
00:02:45,241 --> 00:02:49,331
making this the largest exhibition
staged anywhere in the world."

15
00:02:49,411 --> 00:02:53,171
Remember, sir, three flashes,
then steady red means you're live.

16
00:02:53,251 --> 00:02:55,381
"Using the new invention of radio,...

17
00:02:55,461 --> 00:02:58,671
...the opening ceremony was the first time
His Majesty the King...

18
00:02:58,761 --> 00:03:01,681
...addressed his subjects on the wireless."

19
00:03:01,761 --> 00:03:04,051
"At the close of the first season,

20
00:03:04,141 --> 00:03:07,351
...the heir to the throne,
His Royal Highness, the Prince of Wales,...

21
00:03:07,431 --> 00:03:11,271
...made his first broadcast, and today,...

22
00:03:11,351 --> 00:03:14,861
...his younger brother,
His Royal Highness, the Duke of York,...

23
00:03:14,941 --> 00:03:19,071
...will give his inaugural broadcast
to the nation and the world."

24
00:04:23,303 --> 00:04:25,473
I have received...

25
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:38,113
...from His Majesty the...

26
00:04:47,953 --> 00:04:52,413
...the...

27
00:04:55,623 --> 00:04:57,583
...the King...

28
00:05:22,533 --> 00:05:27,363
Inhale deep into your lungs,
Your Royal Highness.

29
00:05:28,364 --> 00:05:31,374
Relaxes your larynx, does it not?

30
00:05:31,454 --> 00:05:36,464
Cigarette smoking calms the nerves,
and gives you confidence.

31
00:05:36,544 --> 00:05:42,544
Now, if Your Royal Highness
would be so kind as to open your hand.

32
00:05:51,104 --> 00:05:52,264
It's Sterilized. Now..

33
00:05:52,354 --> 00:05:55,314
One, two,

34
00:05:55,394 --> 00:05:58,644
three, four,

35
00:05:58,734 --> 00:06:02,234
five, six...

36
00:06:03,274 --> 00:06:07,154
...seven. Now, if I may take the
liberty, insert them into your mouth?

37
00:06:09,454 --> 00:06:12,824
Excuse me, Doctor.
What is the purpose of this?

38
00:06:12,914 --> 00:06:16,204
It's the classic approach.
It cured Demosthenes.

39
00:06:16,294 --> 00:06:19,374
That was in Ancient Greece...uh
Has it worked since?

40
00:06:19,464 --> 00:06:25,424
Now, if you would be
so kind as to read.

41
00:06:25,804 --> 00:06:27,844
"A wealth of words."

42
00:06:34,975 --> 00:06:37,605
Fight against those marbles,
Your Royal Highness.

43
00:06:40,405 --> 00:06:42,235
Enunciate.

44
00:06:45,825 --> 00:06:49,655
A little more concentration,
Your Royal Highness.

45
00:06:52,625 --> 00:06:55,495
I nearly swallowed the bloody things!

46
00:06:56,205 --> 00:07:00,255
Thank you so much, Doctor.
It's been most, um...

47
00:07:00,335 --> 00:07:03,045
- ...interesting.
- Your Royal Highness.

48
00:07:05,175 --> 00:07:10,305
Insert marbles.
He can insert his own bloody marbles.

49
00:07:16,065 --> 00:07:18,685
Tick, tock. Tick, tock.

50
00:07:20,315 --> 00:07:22,855
You know you can't
keep doing this, Bertie.

51
00:07:25,735 --> 00:07:28,025
- I know.
- Mmm.

52
00:07:30,865 --> 00:07:33,115
Promise me...

53
00:07:34,205 --> 00:07:35,785
Promise me no more.

54
00:08:32,386 --> 00:08:33,886
Ah!

55
00:09:03,337 --> 00:09:04,507
Hello?

56
00:09:05,257 --> 00:09:08,887
- Is anyone there?
- I'm just in the loo.

57
00:09:18,977 --> 00:09:21,767
Ah, Mrs. Johnson, there you are.

58
00:09:21,857 --> 00:09:25,237
I'm sorry, I don't have a receptionist.
I like to keep things simple.

59
00:09:25,317 --> 00:09:28,067
"Poor and content
is rich and rich enough."

60
00:09:28,157 --> 00:09:30,947
- I'm sorry?
- Shakespeare. How are you?

61
00:09:32,737 --> 00:09:35,577
- How do you do?
- Oh, chuffing along.

62
00:09:35,657 --> 00:09:39,417
Um, now, this is slightly awkward,
but I'm afraid you're late.

63
00:09:40,837 --> 00:09:43,917
- Yes. I'm afraid I am.
- Where's Mr. Johnson?

64
00:09:44,007 --> 00:09:47,047
Ah... He doesn't know I'm here.

65
00:09:47,127 --> 00:09:49,377
Well, that's not a very promising start.

66
00:09:49,468 --> 00:09:55,058
No. No, look,
my husband has seen everyone...

67
00:09:55,138 --> 00:09:57,768
...To no avail.
I'm awfully afraid he's given up hope.

68
00:09:57,848 --> 00:10:01,268
- He hasn't seen me.
- You’re awfully sure of yourself.

69
00:10:01,358 --> 00:10:03,898
Well, I'm sure of anyone
who wants to be cured.

70
00:10:03,978 --> 00:10:08,068
Of course he wants to be cured.
My husband is, um...

71
00:10:08,148 --> 00:10:12,068
- Well, he's required to speak publicly.
- Perhaps he should change jobs?

72
00:10:12,158 --> 00:10:16,198
- He can't.
- Indentured servitude?

73
00:10:16,288 --> 00:10:19,208
Something of that nature, yes.

74
00:10:19,288 --> 00:10:22,418
Well, we need to have your hubby pop by.

75
00:10:22,498 --> 00:10:25,298
Uh... Tuesday would be good.

76
00:10:25,378 --> 00:10:28,208
He can give me his personal details,
I'll make a frank appraisal...

77
00:10:28,298 --> 00:10:30,878
- ...and then we'll take it from there.
- Doctor, forgive me.

78
00:10:30,968 --> 00:10:34,008
Uh, I don't have a "hubby."
We don't "pop."

79
00:10:34,098 --> 00:10:37,468
And nor do we ever talk about
our private lives.

80
00:10:37,558 --> 00:10:39,598
No, you must come to us.

81
00:10:39,688 --> 00:10:42,978
I'm sorry, Mrs. Johnson,
my game, my turf, my rules.

82
00:10:43,058 --> 00:10:44,188
Mmm.

83
00:10:44,268 --> 00:10:45,978
You'll have to talk this over
with your husband,

84
00:10:46,068 --> 00:10:48,438
and then you can speak to me
on the telephone.

85
00:10:48,528 --> 00:10:52,108
Thank you very much for dropping by...
Good afternoon.

86
00:10:55,329 --> 00:10:58,039
And what if my husband
were the Duke of York?

87
00:10:58,119 --> 00:11:02,459
- The Duke of York?
- Yes... The Duke of York.

88
00:11:12,759 --> 00:11:15,639
I thought the appointment
was for Johnson. Forgive me, Your...

89
00:11:15,719 --> 00:11:17,849
- Royal Highness.
- ...Royal Highness.

90
00:11:17,929 --> 00:11:21,269
Yes, Johnson was used during the Great
War, when the Navy didn't want the enemy

91
00:11:21,349 --> 00:11:25,019
- ...to know he was aboard.
- Am I...considered the enemy?

92
00:11:25,109 --> 00:11:27,859
You will be, if you remain un-obliging.

93
00:11:28,689 --> 00:11:31,439
You'll appreciate the need
for absolute discretion.

94
00:11:31,529 --> 00:11:33,609
Of course.

95
00:11:33,699 --> 00:11:36,619
How did you find me,
Your Royal Highness?

96
00:11:36,699 --> 00:11:39,699
The President of The Society
For Speech Therapists.

97
00:11:39,789 --> 00:11:42,579
Eileen McCleod?
She's a sport.

98
00:11:42,669 --> 00:11:44,669
Dr McCleod warned me your antipodean
methods were...

99
00:11:44,749 --> 00:11:48,039
...both "unorthodox" and "controversial."

100
00:11:48,129 --> 00:11:51,839
I warned her those
are not my favourite words.

101
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:54,549
I can cure your husband.
But for my method to work,...

102
00:11:54,639 --> 00:12:00,389
...I need trust and total equality, here
in the safety of my consultation room.

103
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:02,430
No exceptions.

104
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,980
Oh, well then... In that case...

105
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:16,070
When can you start?

106
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:29,290
- She's still sounding a bit rough, mate.
- You make me drive too slowly, Dad!

107
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:33,090
- Did you pick Mum up from bridge?
- Yeah, I've hardly been out of the car.

108
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:36,380
I had a special visitor this afternoon.

109
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:39,350
- May I please leave the table?
- How special's special?

110
00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:42,890
No, you must stay, bored stupid, listening
to your parents' inane conversation.

111
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:44,180
- Thanks, Dad...
- And Mum.

112
00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:45,560
- And Mum.
- Me, too.

113
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:49,190
- You meeting Jean?
- No. Someone else.

114
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:53,400
- Doctor? Doctor?
- Hmm?

115
00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:55,240
Go and help your brother
with the washing up.

116
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:58,030
- I'm fine.
- Who is it, Lionel?

117
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:01,410
Why bring it up
if you can't talk about it?

118
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:06,120
Myrtle, it's just a woman
looking to help her husband.

119
00:13:06,211 --> 00:13:09,791
Oh, and I had a call... for an audition.

120
00:13:09,881 --> 00:13:11,841
- One of my favourites.
- Aren't they all?

121
00:13:12,711 --> 00:13:14,381
It Could be a lot of fun.

122
00:13:14,471 --> 00:13:16,471
I'm sure you'll be splendid.

123
00:13:16,551 --> 00:13:19,551
In the amateur scene,
they're a highly regarded group.

124
00:13:20,931 --> 00:13:22,471
From Putney.

125
00:13:22,561 --> 00:13:25,981
No, that's all girls.
Tomorrow, chapter four, "The Flight."

126
00:13:26,061 --> 00:13:28,981
Mama,
I long to know where they fly to.

127
00:13:29,061 --> 00:13:31,481
- I can't wait!
- Oh, to fly away.

128
00:13:31,571 --> 00:13:33,901
Weren't they lucky?

129
00:13:33,981 --> 00:13:35,861
Now Papa, tell a story.

130
00:13:39,741 --> 00:13:43,541
Can't I be a penguin instead?

131
00:13:44,951 --> 00:13:49,961
Well, no, I want a penguin story.

132
00:13:51,961 --> 00:13:54,881
Very quickly.

133
00:13:56,261 --> 00:14:00,011
Once there were...
two princesses.

134
00:14:00,091 --> 00:14:03,181
Princess Elizabeth
and Princess Margaret,

135
00:14:03,261 --> 00:14:05,771
whose papa was a penguin.

136
00:14:08,231 --> 00:14:11,481
This was because he'd been
turned into one by a wicked witch.

137
00:14:12,862 --> 00:14:16,282
This was very inconvenient for him
because he loved...

138
00:14:18,572 --> 00:14:21,202
...to hold his princesses in his arms.

139
00:14:21,282 --> 00:14:23,952
But you can't if you're a penguin
because you...

140
00:14:24,622 --> 00:14:28,872
- ...you have wings like herrings.
- Herrings don't have wings.

141
00:14:28,962 --> 00:14:33,212
Penguins have wings which are...
are shaped like herrings.

142
00:14:35,002 --> 00:14:40,722
And what made matters worse is that
she... she sent him to the South Pole,

143
00:14:40,802 --> 00:14:43,642
which is an awfully long walk back if...

144
00:14:43,722 --> 00:14:46,012
...if you can't fly.

145
00:14:46,102 --> 00:14:49,562
So when he reached the water, he...

146
00:14:49,642 --> 00:14:51,692
...he dived in, through the depths,

147
00:14:51,772 --> 00:14:55,152
so fast that he was in
Southampton Waters by lunchtime.

148
00:14:55,232 --> 00:14:59,072
And from there,
he took the 2:30 to Weybridge,

149
00:14:59,152 --> 00:15:02,742
changed at Clapham Junction, asked a...

150
00:15:02,822 --> 00:15:05,242
...a passing mallard the way
to Buckingham Palace,

151
00:15:05,332 --> 00:15:08,412
swam up The Thames,
out through the plughole

152
00:15:08,502 --> 00:15:13,422
and gave the cook, Mama
and Mrs. Whittaker quite a shock.

153
00:15:13,502 --> 00:15:16,592
Now, when the girls
heard all the commotion,

154
00:15:16,673 --> 00:15:19,763
they ran to the kitchen,
where they gave him a...

155
00:15:19,843 --> 00:15:22,933
...a good scrub, a mackerel and a kiss.

156
00:15:23,013 --> 00:15:25,973
And as they kissed him...

157
00:15:27,103 --> 00:15:28,513
...guess what he turned into?

158
00:15:28,603 --> 00:15:32,353
- A handsome prince.
- A short-tailed albatross.

159
00:15:32,443 --> 00:15:36,153
- Oh.
- With wings so big,

160
00:15:36,233 --> 00:15:41,443
that he could wrap them both around
his two girls together.

161
00:15:41,533 --> 00:15:43,783
Now, girls. Time for bed. Come on.

162
00:15:43,863 --> 00:15:45,823
- And take those horses to the stable.
- Quickly, now.

163
00:15:45,913 --> 00:15:47,993
- You have exactly a minute.
- Good night.

164
00:15:48,083 --> 00:15:50,123
Feed them, brush them and to bed.

165
00:15:51,413 --> 00:15:55,383
- Will Mrs. Simpson be there?
- My brother's insisting.

166
00:15:56,503 --> 00:16:01,303
- Is he serious?
- About her coming to dinner?

167
00:16:01,383 --> 00:16:03,803
No. About her.

168
00:16:05,933 --> 00:16:09,353
- A married woman? He can't be.
- She can.

169
00:16:10,063 --> 00:16:12,773
By the way, I think I've found
someone rather interesting.

170
00:16:12,853 --> 00:16:14,393
On Harley Street. A doctor.

171
00:16:14,483 --> 00:16:16,693
Out of the question.

172
00:16:16,773 --> 00:16:20,323
I'm not having this conversation again.
Mat... Matter's settled.

173
00:16:20,404 --> 00:16:22,154
Mmm. His approach
seems rather different.

174
00:16:25,414 --> 00:16:26,414
Now?

175
00:16:27,994 --> 00:16:29,414
Now.

176
00:16:36,754 --> 00:16:39,294
Now is the winter of our discontent,

177
00:16:39,384 --> 00:16:44,174
made glorious summer
by this sun of York.

178
00:16:44,264 --> 00:16:46,974
And all the clouds
that lour'd upon our house

179
00:16:47,054 --> 00:16:49,684
In the deep bosom of the ocean buried.

180
00:16:49,764 --> 00:16:53,984
Now are our brows bound
with... victorious... wreaths;

181
00:16:54,064 --> 00:16:55,774
Thank you.

182
00:16:58,524 --> 00:17:02,534
- Lovely diction, Mr...?
- Logue. Lionel Logue.

183
00:17:02,614 --> 00:17:05,244
Well, Mr. Logue,

184
00:17:05,324 --> 00:17:09,204
I'm not hearing the cries
of a deformed creature

185
00:17:09,284 --> 00:17:11,914
yearning to be king.

186
00:17:11,994 --> 00:17:16,544
Nor did I realize Richard III
was King of the Colonies.

187
00:17:19,634 --> 00:17:23,254
I do know all the lines.
I've played the role before.

188
00:17:23,344 --> 00:17:25,054
- Sydney?
- Perth.

189
00:17:25,134 --> 00:17:27,304
Major theatre town, is it?

190
00:17:27,385 --> 00:17:30,345
- Enthusiastic.
- Ah.

191
00:17:30,435 --> 00:17:33,185
I was well reviewed.

192
00:17:34,565 --> 00:17:36,235
Yes.

193
00:17:36,315 --> 00:17:42,325
Well, Lionel,
I think our dramatic society

194
00:17:42,405 --> 00:17:45,535
is looking for someone slightly younger.

195
00:17:45,615 --> 00:17:51,075
And a... little more regal.

196
00:17:54,245 --> 00:17:57,335
- There you are.
- Thank you.

197
00:18:01,295 --> 00:18:02,255
- Oh.
- Mmm.

198
00:18:02,345 --> 00:18:04,675
No, you have to shut that one first.

199
00:18:04,765 --> 00:18:07,805
Close that one first. That's it.

200
00:18:09,015 --> 00:18:11,845
Where did you find this... physician?

201
00:18:11,935 --> 00:18:15,685
Classifieds. Next to a
"French model, Shepherd's Market."

202
00:18:15,775 --> 00:18:17,275
No, he comes highly recommended.

203
00:18:17,355 --> 00:18:19,565
Charges substantial fees
to help the poor.

204
00:18:19,905 --> 00:18:22,565
Oh, dear. Perhaps he's a Bolshevik.

205
00:18:25,115 --> 00:18:28,615
Ah, there's no receptionist.
Likes to keep things simple.

206
00:18:30,745 --> 00:18:34,205
Uh... The Johnsons.

207
00:18:45,096 --> 00:18:48,636
You can go in now, Mr. Johnson.

208
00:18:48,726 --> 00:18:53,436
Lionel says wait here
if you wish, Mrs. Johnson.

209
00:18:53,516 --> 00:18:56,606
Or, it being a...

210
00:18:58,316 --> 00:19:00,816
... pleasant day...

211
00:19:04,276 --> 00:19:07,286
P...perhaps take a stroll.

212
00:19:08,196 --> 00:19:11,746
Was that all right, Lionel?

213
00:19:14,076 --> 00:19:15,746
Marvelous, Willie.

214
00:19:15,836 --> 00:19:18,126
You can stay here and wait for your mum.

215
00:19:19,126 --> 00:19:20,376
Mrs. Johnson.

216
00:19:21,796 --> 00:19:24,336
Mr. Johnson. Do come in.

217
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:44,697
Would you like a sweetie?

218
00:19:44,777 --> 00:19:47,197
He's a good lad, Willie.

219
00:19:47,277 --> 00:19:50,577
He could hardly make a sound, you know,
when he first came to me.

220
00:19:59,297 --> 00:20:01,877
My boys make those.
They're good, aren't they?

221
00:20:03,127 --> 00:20:05,297
Please, make yourself comfortable.

222
00:20:21,527 --> 00:20:24,277
I was told not to sit too close.

223
00:20:31,997 --> 00:20:33,537
Well I believe when speaking with a prince,

224
00:20:33,617 --> 00:20:36,537
One waits for the prince
to choose the topic.

225
00:20:42,668 --> 00:20:44,588
Waiting for me to...

226
00:20:46,678 --> 00:20:50,848
...commence a conversation,
one can wait rather a long wait.

227
00:20:50,928 --> 00:20:53,848
Ah, yes, well...

228
00:20:59,648 --> 00:21:01,268
Do you know any jokes?

229
00:21:08,198 --> 00:21:13,788
- Timing isn't my strong suit.
- Cup of tea?

230
00:21:13,868 --> 00:21:18,078
- No. No, thank you.
- I think I'll have one.

231
00:21:31,048 --> 00:21:33,718
Aren't you going to start treating me,
Dr. Logue?

232
00:21:33,808 --> 00:21:36,848
Only if you're interested
in being treated.

233
00:21:36,938 --> 00:21:40,598
Please, call me Lionel.

234
00:21:40,688 --> 00:21:43,938
No, I... prefer Doctor.

235
00:21:44,028 --> 00:21:46,568
I prefer Lionel.

236
00:21:47,739 --> 00:21:51,159
- What will I call you?
- Your Royal Highness.

237
00:21:51,949 --> 00:21:54,909
Then... it's "sir" after that.

238
00:21:54,999 --> 00:21:58,829
It's a little bit formal for here.
I prefer names.

239
00:21:58,919 --> 00:22:03,959
Prince Albert Frederick Arthur...

240
00:22:04,049 --> 00:22:05,129
...George?

241
00:22:05,629 --> 00:22:07,129
How about Bertie?

242
00:22:10,339 --> 00:22:13,509
- Only my family uses that.
- Perfect.

243
00:22:13,599 --> 00:22:17,099
In here, it's better if we're equals.

244
00:22:20,649 --> 00:22:25,819
If... if we were equals,
I wouldn't be here.

245
00:22:25,899 --> 00:22:30,779
I'd be... at home with my wife,

246
00:22:30,859 --> 00:22:32,989
and no one would give a damn.

247
00:22:33,079 --> 00:22:35,199
Please, don't do that.

248
00:22:35,289 --> 00:22:36,699
I'm sorry?

249
00:22:36,789 --> 00:22:40,869
I believe sucking smoke into your lungs,
well, it will kill you.

250
00:22:40,959 --> 00:22:44,459
My physicians say it relaxes the...

251
00:22:44,539 --> 00:22:46,419
- ...the throat.
- They're idiots.

252
00:22:46,509 --> 00:22:50,509
- They've all been knighted.
- Makes it official, then.

253
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,760
My castle, my rules.

254
00:22:58,810 --> 00:23:00,270
Thank you.

255
00:23:01,810 --> 00:23:03,400
What was your earliest memory?

256
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:07,730
- What on earth do you mean?
- Your first recollection.

257
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:09,320
I'm not...

258
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:14,030
...here to discuss personal matters.

259
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:17,660
- Well, why are you here, then?
- Because I bloody well stammer!

260
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:22,750
- You have a bit of a temper.
- One of my many faults.

261
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:26,710
- When did the defect start?
- I've always been this way.

262
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,960
- I doubt that.
- Don't...

263
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:32,090
- ...tell me, it's my stammer.
- It's my field.

264
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:36,180
I can assure you, no infant
starts to speak with a stammer.

265
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:38,260
When did yours start?

266
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:43,390
- Four or five.
- That's typical.

267
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:46,400
So I've been told.

268
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:49,070
I... I can't remember not doing it.

269
00:23:49,150 --> 00:23:52,780
I can believe that.
Do you hesitate when you think?

270
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:57,200
- Don't be ridiculous.
- How about when you talk to yourself?

271
00:23:58,831 --> 00:24:01,371
Everyone natters to themselves
occasionally, Bertie.

272
00:24:01,461 --> 00:24:03,291
Stop... Stop calling me that.

273
00:24:03,371 --> 00:24:04,751
I'm not going to call you anything else.

274
00:24:04,831 --> 00:24:09,711
Then we shan't speak.

275
00:24:21,601 --> 00:24:23,931
Are you charging for this, Doctor?

276
00:24:26,561 --> 00:24:28,151
A fortune.

277
00:24:34,401 --> 00:24:36,361
I'll just let that brew.

278
00:24:37,371 --> 00:24:41,741
So... when you talk to yourself,
do you stammer?

279
00:24:41,831 --> 00:24:45,501
No... of course not.

280
00:24:46,251 --> 00:24:50,001
Well, that proves that your impediment
isn't a permanent part of you.

281
00:24:50,091 --> 00:24:52,341
What do you think was the cause?

282
00:24:52,421 --> 00:24:54,421
I don't... don't know.

283
00:24:54,511 --> 00:24:57,971
I... I don't... I don't care.

284
00:24:58,761 --> 00:25:00,721
I... I stammer.

285
00:25:02,771 --> 00:25:04,021
No one can fix it.

286
00:25:04,102 --> 00:25:08,732
I'll bet you that you can read
flawlessly, right here, right now.

287
00:25:08,812 --> 00:25:11,942
And if I win the bet,
I get to ask you more questions.

288
00:25:12,032 --> 00:25:14,942
- And if I win?
- You don't have to answer them.

289
00:25:15,032 --> 00:25:19,662
One usually... wagers money.

290
00:25:19,742 --> 00:25:22,122
A bob each to keep it sweet?

291
00:25:22,202 --> 00:25:27,292
- Let's see your shilling.
- I don't... carry money.

292
00:25:27,372 --> 00:25:29,832
I had a funny feeling you mightn't.

293
00:25:29,922 --> 00:25:33,382
I'll stake you, and you can
pay me back next time.

294
00:25:33,462 --> 00:25:37,472
- If there is a next time.
- I haven't agreed to take you on yet.

295
00:25:41,142 --> 00:25:44,012
So please stand, uh,
and take a look at that.

296
00:25:44,102 --> 00:25:46,312
From there.

297
00:25:50,652 --> 00:25:54,072
I... I can't read this.

298
00:25:54,152 --> 00:25:56,652
Well, then you owe me
a shilling for not trying.

299
00:26:09,333 --> 00:26:11,003
To be...

300
00:26:12,133 --> 00:26:14,343
...or not to be, that...

301
00:26:18,473 --> 00:26:23,353
- Can't read it.
- Uh-uh-uh! I haven't finished yet.

302
00:26:32,523 --> 00:26:36,863
I'm going to record your voice and then
play it back to you on the same machine.

303
00:26:36,943 --> 00:26:40,203
This is brilliant.
It's the latest thing from America.

304
00:26:40,283 --> 00:26:41,743
It's a Silvertone.

305
00:26:54,253 --> 00:26:55,253
Pop these on.

306
00:26:57,513 --> 00:27:00,343
There's a bob in this, mate.
You could go home rich.

307
00:27:09,603 --> 00:27:12,603
- You're playing music!
- I know.

308
00:27:12,693 --> 00:27:14,313
So how can I hear what I'm saying?

309
00:27:14,404 --> 00:27:17,984
Well, surely a prince's brain
knows what its mouth's doing?

310
00:27:18,074 --> 00:27:22,494
You're not... well acquainted
with royal princes, are you?

311
00:27:58,364 --> 00:27:59,904
Hopeless.

312
00:27:59,984 --> 00:28:01,154
Hopeless!

313
00:28:03,744 --> 00:28:05,034
You were sublime.

314
00:28:06,414 --> 00:28:09,204
Would I lie to a prince of the realm
to win 12 pennies?

315
00:28:09,294 --> 00:28:10,744
I've no idea...

316
00:28:11,294 --> 00:28:13,874
...what an Australian
might do for that sort of money.

317
00:28:13,964 --> 00:28:15,964
Let me play it back to you.

318
00:28:17,254 --> 00:28:18,294
No.

319
00:28:18,384 --> 00:28:20,554
All right, then, well,
I get to ask you the questions.

320
00:28:20,635 --> 00:28:24,095
Thank you, Doctor. I don't...

321
00:28:24,185 --> 00:28:26,185
...feel this is for me.

322
00:28:30,395 --> 00:28:32,225
Thank you for your time.

323
00:28:33,645 --> 00:28:35,195
Goodbye.

324
00:28:36,485 --> 00:28:37,865
Sir?

325
00:28:43,495 --> 00:28:47,785
The recording is free.
Please keep it as a souvenir.

326
00:29:01,555 --> 00:29:02,965
No.

327
00:29:08,555 --> 00:29:10,105
Oh, well.

328
00:29:13,645 --> 00:29:15,395
Bugger.

329
00:29:19,775 --> 00:29:23,865
For the present, the work
to which we are all equally bound,

330
00:29:23,945 --> 00:29:28,205
is to arrive at a reasoned tranquillity
within our borders,

331
00:29:28,286 --> 00:29:32,536
...to regain prosperity
at this time of depression

332
00:29:32,626 --> 00:29:35,796
without self-seeking,
and to carry with us

333
00:29:35,876 --> 00:29:39,006
those whom the burden of the past years

334
00:29:39,086 --> 00:29:42,216
has disheartened or overborne.

335
00:29:42,306 --> 00:29:47,766
To all, to each,
I wish a happy Christmas.

336
00:29:47,846 --> 00:29:49,896
God bless you.

337
00:29:51,606 --> 00:29:53,396
And off air.

338
00:29:56,486 --> 00:29:58,146
Easy when you know how.

339
00:29:58,236 --> 00:30:00,196
Sir?

340
00:30:08,156 --> 00:30:09,786
Have a go yourself.

341
00:30:09,866 --> 00:30:12,076
- Congratulations, sir.
- Ah, Mr. Wood.

342
00:30:12,166 --> 00:30:15,666
Splendid fellow.
Chap who taught me everything I know.

343
00:30:15,756 --> 00:30:19,006
- Let the microphone do the work.
- Sir.

344
00:30:19,086 --> 00:30:21,506
- Thank you.
- Gentlemen.

345
00:30:21,586 --> 00:30:23,596
Sit up. Straight back.

346
00:30:23,676 --> 00:30:26,806
Face boldly up to the bloody thing
and stare it square in the eye,

347
00:30:26,886 --> 00:30:30,016
as would any decent Englishman.
Show who's in command.

348
00:30:30,097 --> 00:30:33,687
Papa, I d...don't... thu...thu...
think I c... c... can read this.

349
00:30:33,767 --> 00:30:37,187
This devilish device will change
everything if you don't.

350
00:30:37,277 --> 00:30:40,697
In the past, all a king had to do
was look respectable in uniform

351
00:30:40,777 --> 00:30:42,657
and not fall off his horse.

352
00:30:42,737 --> 00:30:46,367
Now, we must invade people's homes
and ingratiate ourselves with them.

353
00:30:46,447 --> 00:30:51,037
This family's been reduced to those
lowest, basest of all creatures.

354
00:30:51,117 --> 00:30:52,877
We've become actors.

355
00:30:53,837 --> 00:30:55,997
We're not a family, we're a firm.

356
00:30:56,087 --> 00:30:59,047
Yet at any moment,
some of us may be out of work.

357
00:30:59,127 --> 00:31:02,047
Your darling brother and future king,

358
00:31:02,137 --> 00:31:05,847
the only wife he appears interested in
is invariably the wife of another.

359
00:31:05,927 --> 00:31:09,887
- He's broken off with Lady Furness.
- And taken up with Mrs. Simpson.

360
00:31:09,977 --> 00:31:13,397
A woman with two husbands living.
I told him straight.

361
00:31:13,477 --> 00:31:17,017
No divorced person
can ever be received at court.

362
00:31:17,107 --> 00:31:22,067
He said it made him sublimely happy.

363
00:31:22,157 --> 00:31:25,867
I imagine that was
because she was sleeping with him.

364
00:31:25,947 --> 00:31:27,737
"I give you my word,"
this is what he said.

365
00:31:27,827 --> 00:31:32,367
"I give you my word,
we've never had immoral relations."

366
00:31:32,457 --> 00:31:36,537
Stared square into
his father's face and lied.

367
00:31:36,628 --> 00:31:38,878
When I'm dead,
that boy will ruin himself,

368
00:31:38,958 --> 00:31:41,258
this family and this nation
within 12 months.

369
00:31:41,338 --> 00:31:45,758
Who will pick up the pieces, hmm?
Herr Hitler intimidating half of Europe.

370
00:31:45,848 --> 00:31:48,098
Marshal Stalin the other half.

371
00:31:48,178 --> 00:31:50,468
Who will stand between us,

372
00:31:50,558 --> 00:31:54,598
the jackboots
and the proletarian abyss?

373
00:31:55,608 --> 00:31:57,148
You?

374
00:31:58,568 --> 00:32:01,608
Well?

375
00:32:01,688 --> 00:32:04,278
With your older brother
shirking his duties,

376
00:32:04,358 --> 00:32:06,868
you're going to have to do
a lot more of this.

377
00:32:08,198 --> 00:32:09,738
Have a go yourself.

378
00:32:15,628 --> 00:32:18,458
Through the...

379
00:32:18,538 --> 00:32:20,418
...wireless...
- Get it out, boy.

380
00:32:20,508 --> 00:32:22,878
...one of the...

381
00:32:22,968 --> 00:32:24,718
... m... marvels of m...

382
00:32:26,388 --> 00:32:31,428
"Modern." Just take your time.
Form your words carefully.

383
00:32:31,518 --> 00:32:33,268
...science...

384
00:32:34,228 --> 00:32:36,938
...I am enabled, this ...

385
00:32:37,018 --> 00:32:38,728
Relax.

386
00:32:42,069 --> 00:32:43,279
Just try it!

387
00:32:43,359 --> 00:32:45,239
...this Christmas Day...

388
00:32:47,739 --> 00:32:49,869
...to speak to all my...

389
00:32:51,239 --> 00:32:52,199
Do it!

390
00:33:06,339 --> 00:33:09,589
Lying... bastard.

391
00:33:28,279 --> 00:33:31,239
- You're playing music.
- I know.

392
00:33:31,329 --> 00:33:34,239
So how can I...
hear what I'm saying?

393
00:33:34,329 --> 00:33:37,579
Well, surely a prince's brain
knows what its mouth's doing.

394
00:33:37,669 --> 00:33:41,629
You're not... well acquainted
with royal princes, are you?

395
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:54,850
"To be or not be,
that is the question.

396
00:33:54,930 --> 00:33:57,890
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer

397
00:33:57,980 --> 00:34:01,400
the slings and arrows
of outrageous fortune,

398
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:04,360
or to take arms
against a sea of troubles,

399
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:07,740
and by opposing end them?

400
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:10,950
To die, to sleep no more,

401
00:34:11,030 --> 00:34:13,910
and by a sleep to say the end

402
00:34:13,990 --> 00:34:17,080
is the heartache
and the thousand natural shocks

403
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:22,790
the flesh is heir to:
'tis a consummation hopeless."

404
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:24,750
Hopeless!

405
00:34:25,710 --> 00:34:28,260
Strictly business. No...

406
00:34:30,510 --> 00:34:33,300
- ...personal nonsense.
- Yes, I thought I'd made that clear...

407
00:34:33,390 --> 00:34:36,100
- ...in our interview.
- Have you got the shilling you owe me?

408
00:34:36,180 --> 00:34:39,680
- No, I haven't.
- Didn't think so.

409
00:34:39,770 --> 00:34:42,440
Besides, you... you tricked me.

410
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:45,110
Physical exercises
and tricks are important,

411
00:34:45,190 --> 00:34:48,440
but what you're asking will only deal
with the surface of the problem.

412
00:34:48,530 --> 00:34:50,610
Is that sufficient? Uh, no.

413
00:34:50,701 --> 00:34:56,541
As far as I see it, my husband has
mechanical difficulties with his speech.

414
00:34:56,621 --> 00:34:59,451
- I...
- Maybe just deal with that.

415
00:35:00,461 --> 00:35:02,671
I...

416
00:35:02,751 --> 00:35:07,211
- I'm willing to work hard, Dr. Logue.
- Lionel.

417
00:35:07,301 --> 00:35:11,971
Are you...
Are you willing to do your part?

418
00:35:14,601 --> 00:35:17,311
All right. You want mechanics?

419
00:35:17,391 --> 00:35:20,561
We need to relax your jaw muscles,
strengthen your tongue,

420
00:35:20,641 --> 00:35:24,351
by repeating tongue twisters.
For example, "I'm a thistle-sifter.

421
00:35:24,441 --> 00:35:27,321
I have a sieve of sifted thistles
and a sieve of unsifted thistles.

422
00:35:27,401 --> 00:35:29,821
- Because I am a thistle-sifter."
- Fine.

423
00:35:29,901 --> 00:35:32,991
And you do have a flabby tummy,
so we'll need to spend some time

424
00:35:33,071 --> 00:35:35,781
strengthening your diaphragm.
Simple mechanics.

425
00:35:35,871 --> 00:35:38,081
- That's all we ask.
- All that's about a shilling's worth.

426
00:35:38,161 --> 00:35:40,501
Forget about the blessed shilling!

427
00:35:53,891 --> 00:35:56,931
Perhaps, upon occasions...

428
00:35:57,012 --> 00:35:59,432
...you might be requested to assist...

429
00:36:02,522 --> 00:36:06,192
...in coping with...

430
00:36:06,272 --> 00:36:09,822
...with some minor event.
Would that be agreeable?

431
00:36:09,902 --> 00:36:11,862
Of course.

432
00:36:11,942 --> 00:36:15,612
Yes, and that would be the full extent
of your services.

433
00:36:15,702 --> 00:36:19,702
- Shall I see you next week?
- I shall see you every day.

434
00:36:19,792 --> 00:36:24,252
Ahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahahah.

435
00:36:24,332 --> 00:36:26,632
Feel the looseness of the jaw.

436
00:36:29,802 --> 00:36:31,762
Good. Little bounces. Bounces.

437
00:36:31,842 --> 00:36:33,722
Shoulders loose, shoulders loose.

438
00:36:33,802 --> 00:36:36,972
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful.
Now, loose.

439
00:36:41,182 --> 00:36:44,392
Take a nice deep breath.
Expand the chest.

440
00:36:44,482 --> 00:36:46,482
Put your hands onto your ribs.

441
00:36:47,522 --> 00:36:49,692
Deeper. Good.

442
00:36:49,772 --> 00:36:52,822
- How do you feel?
- Full of hot air.

443
00:36:52,902 --> 00:36:55,282
Isn't that what
public speaking's all about?

444
00:36:55,362 --> 00:37:00,872
My wife and I are glad
to visit this important...

445
00:37:00,952 --> 00:37:04,832
Take a good deep breath,
and up comes Your Royal Highness.

446
00:37:04,913 --> 00:37:09,253
And slowly exhale,
and down comes Your Royal Highness.

447
00:37:09,343 --> 00:37:11,543
- You all right, Bertie?
- Yes.

448
00:37:11,633 --> 00:37:13,173
It's actually quite good fun.

449
00:37:13,633 --> 00:37:14,973
Mmm... Mother.

450
00:37:15,053 --> 00:37:16,683
Shorten the humming each time.

451
00:37:16,763 --> 00:37:18,933
Mother. Mmm...

452
00:37:19,013 --> 00:37:22,433
...manufacturing district...
- Another deep breath.

453
00:37:22,523 --> 00:37:25,103
- And Jack and Jill.
- Jack and Jill.

454
00:37:25,183 --> 00:37:27,023
- Went up the hill.
- Went up the hill.

455
00:37:27,103 --> 00:37:28,773
Now, just sway.

456
00:37:29,773 --> 00:37:31,273
Perfect.

457
00:37:31,363 --> 00:37:35,153
...will not permit us to...
- Loosen the shoulders.

458
00:37:35,243 --> 00:37:37,613
Ding dong bell,
pussy's in the well.

459
00:37:37,703 --> 00:37:41,373
Who put her in? Little Tommy Tin.

460
00:37:44,873 --> 00:37:47,253
You have a short memory, Bertie.
Come on.

461
00:37:49,713 --> 00:37:53,303
- A cow, a cow...
- A king.

462
00:37:53,383 --> 00:37:54,463
A... a king...

463
00:37:58,883 --> 00:38:03,013
Anyone who can shout vowels at an open
window can learn to deliver a speech.

464
00:38:05,223 --> 00:38:08,233
- Fourteen, 15!
- Good. Deep breath, and...

465
00:38:08,314 --> 00:38:10,484
It is...

466
00:38:10,564 --> 00:38:13,324
- Let the words flow.
- No, it doesn't bloody work.

467
00:38:13,404 --> 00:38:16,324
Come on, one more time, Bertie.
You can do it.

468
00:38:16,404 --> 00:38:18,654
A sieve of thisted siphles.

469
00:38:18,744 --> 00:38:22,574
Gah! Mah! Bah!

470
00:38:32,754 --> 00:38:34,634
Father.

471
00:38:34,714 --> 00:38:35,964
- Father.
- Father.

472
00:38:36,054 --> 00:38:37,764
- Aim for the a-t-h.
- Father.

473
00:38:37,844 --> 00:38:40,224
- Father.
- Father.

474
00:38:40,304 --> 00:38:43,434
Father. Father.

475
00:39:13,795 --> 00:39:17,215
- Hello, Bertie.
- Hello, David.

476
00:39:17,305 --> 00:39:20,055
- Nice of you to come out.
- Not at all.

477
00:39:22,645 --> 00:39:24,515
You been waiting long?

478
00:39:25,475 --> 00:39:27,565
Christ, bloody freezing.

479
00:39:28,935 --> 00:39:30,735
Where have you been?

480
00:39:31,695 --> 00:39:34,655
- I've been busy.
- So have I.

481
00:39:36,075 --> 00:39:39,285
- Elizabeth has pneumonia.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

482
00:39:39,365 --> 00:39:42,575
- She'll recover.
- Father won't.

483
00:39:45,165 --> 00:39:46,455
I'll drive.

484
00:39:50,005 --> 00:39:52,045
Old bugger's doing this on purpose.

485
00:39:52,125 --> 00:39:56,215
- Dying?
- Departing prematurely.

486
00:39:56,295 --> 00:39:59,135
To... To complicate matters with Wallis.

487
00:40:00,515 --> 00:40:04,015
For heaven's sake, David.
You know how long he's been ill.

488
00:40:04,095 --> 00:40:08,355
Wallis explained. She's terribly clever
about these things.

489
00:40:10,275 --> 00:40:12,855
Whereas my letters patent
under the Great Seal

490
00:40:12,945 --> 00:40:16,695
bearing date of Westminster
the 11th day of June 1912,

491
00:40:16,775 --> 00:40:20,445
His Majesty King George the Fifth
did constitute order

492
00:40:20,536 --> 00:40:22,246
and declare that there
should be a Guardian...

493
00:40:22,326 --> 00:40:24,866
- What's going on here?
- ...custos regne...

494
00:40:24,956 --> 00:40:28,786
I cannot follow you.
I'm confused and I don't understand...

495
00:40:28,876 --> 00:40:31,796
It's the Order
of the Council of State, sir.

496
00:40:31,876 --> 00:40:36,086
So that we may act on your behalf...

497
00:40:36,176 --> 00:40:38,136
...much clearer to me, I'm afraid...

498
00:40:40,466 --> 00:40:44,766
- Well, I'm so confused that...
- Approved.

499
00:40:44,846 --> 00:40:46,476
Thank you.

500
00:40:55,146 --> 00:40:58,866
- Let me help you, sir.
- Ah, yes...

501
00:41:03,786 --> 00:41:06,076
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you.

502
00:41:11,296 --> 00:41:13,706
- Feeling a little better, sir?
- No, I'm not feeling any better.

503
00:41:13,796 --> 00:41:17,086
I feel dreadful. Ah...

504
00:41:18,296 --> 00:41:21,756
Been, uh, ice skating? Ice skating?

505
00:41:21,846 --> 00:41:23,596
No. No, George.

506
00:41:37,527 --> 00:41:40,317
Yes. Yes, all right, of course.

507
00:41:40,407 --> 00:41:43,237
I know, darling.
A talk, even a lovely long talk

508
00:41:43,327 --> 00:41:47,287
is a poor substitute
for holding tight and making drowsy.

509
00:41:48,247 --> 00:41:51,287
Nor making our own drowsies either,
as we've had to do too often lately.

510
00:41:51,377 --> 00:41:54,207
- David. Dinner.
- I'm on with Wallis.

511
00:41:54,297 --> 00:41:56,007
It's Bertie.

512
00:41:57,337 --> 00:42:00,467
No. No, it's not important.

513
00:42:00,927 --> 00:42:04,097
I don't want to.

514
00:42:04,177 --> 00:42:07,427
No. Telephone me later?

515
00:42:07,517 --> 00:42:09,727
All right, goodbye.

516
00:42:11,767 --> 00:42:15,527
- Wallis misses me terribly.
- Mama says you're late for dinner.

517
00:42:22,067 --> 00:42:25,987
She forgets Papa's bloody clocks
are all half an hour fast.

518
00:42:41,178 --> 00:42:44,598
How's the King?
I... I hope he's not in pain.

519
00:42:44,678 --> 00:42:47,468
No, no, sir.
His Majesty's quieter now.

520
00:42:49,268 --> 00:42:51,188
Thank you.

521
00:42:55,978 --> 00:42:59,648
David, if your father were here,
tardiness would not be tolerated.

522
00:43:01,528 --> 00:43:04,698
None of this unpleasantness
would be tolerated.

523
00:43:06,578 --> 00:43:11,368
You know, sir, I appreciate
that you are different from your father,

524
00:43:11,458 --> 00:43:16,418
both in outlook and... temperament.

525
00:43:16,498 --> 00:43:21,008
I want you to know that whenever
the King questioned your conduct,

526
00:43:21,088 --> 00:43:23,888
I tried, in your interest,

527
00:43:23,968 --> 00:43:27,098
to present it
in the most favourable light.

528
00:43:27,178 --> 00:43:31,678
Mmm. I can always trust you
to have my best interests at heart.

529
00:43:46,369 --> 00:43:50,749
I fear our vigil will not be
of long duration. Please continue.

530
00:44:04,469 --> 00:44:08,299
Let us commend our brother George
to the mercy of God,

531
00:44:08,389 --> 00:44:10,969
Our Maker and Redeemer.

532
00:44:23,779 --> 00:44:25,319
Long live the King.

533
00:44:38,630 --> 00:44:41,590
I hope I will make good
as he has made good.

534
00:45:17,330 --> 00:45:20,130
- What on earth was that?
- Poor Wallis.

535
00:45:21,170 --> 00:45:23,210
Now, I'm trapped.

536
00:45:36,850 --> 00:45:41,110
And in these last 25
crowded, troubled, glorious years,

537
00:45:41,190 --> 00:45:44,980
if there is one thing
that King George has taught,

538
00:45:45,071 --> 00:45:48,951
it is the art of the leader who
is also a brother to his followers.

539
00:45:49,871 --> 00:45:54,621
As long as he lived, he was
the guiding star of a great nation.

540
00:45:54,701 --> 00:45:56,291
- Dad?
- Mmm-hmm?

541
00:45:56,371 --> 00:45:58,711
- When he died...
- Time for a Shake, Dad?

542
00:45:58,791 --> 00:46:00,831
... the little children
cried in the streets.

543
00:46:00,921 --> 00:46:03,421
- You sure?
- Go on.

544
00:46:12,141 --> 00:46:14,351
Put your thinking caps on.

545
00:46:16,891 --> 00:46:21,061
- I bet it's the Scottish play.
- No, it's Othello. It's always Othello.

546
00:46:31,571 --> 00:46:33,831
Art thou afeard?

547
00:46:33,911 --> 00:46:36,291
- Be not afeard.
- Caliban.

548
00:46:36,911 --> 00:46:40,461
Oh, for heaven's sake.
That was a lucky guess.

549
00:46:40,541 --> 00:46:43,081
Don't listen to egghead. Go on, Dad.

550
00:46:43,171 --> 00:46:46,801
The isle is full of noises,
sounds and sweet airs

551
00:46:46,881 --> 00:46:49,131
that give delight, and hurt not.

552
00:46:49,222 --> 00:46:53,222
Sometimes a thousand twangling
instruments will hum about mine ears,

553
00:46:53,302 --> 00:46:57,392
and sometimes voices, that,
if then I had waked after long sleep,

554
00:46:57,472 --> 00:47:01,192
will make me sleep again. All right,
clever clogs, so what comes next?

555
00:47:01,272 --> 00:47:04,232
And then, in dreaming,
methought the clouds would...

556
00:47:04,312 --> 00:47:06,982
- The clouds methought.
- The clouds methought would open,

557
00:47:07,072 --> 00:47:09,242
and show riches ready to drop upon me,

558
00:47:09,322 --> 00:47:11,612
that when I waked,
I cried to dream again.

559
00:47:11,702 --> 00:47:13,202
That's such a sad thought.

560
00:47:15,702 --> 00:47:19,622
My next patient must be a bit early.
You better go, lads, I'm sorry.

561
00:47:20,662 --> 00:47:22,582
Won't be a moment, Clifford.

562
00:47:26,502 --> 00:47:27,502
Bertie?

563
00:47:30,382 --> 00:47:32,382
They told me not to expect you.

564
00:47:34,342 --> 00:47:36,642
I'm sorry about your father.

565
00:47:37,512 --> 00:47:41,482
- I don't wish to intrude.
- Not at all. Please, come in. Come in.

566
00:47:52,152 --> 00:47:55,452
I've been practicing. An hour a day.

567
00:47:55,533 --> 00:47:57,623
In spite of everything.

568
00:47:58,453 --> 00:47:59,583
What's going on there?

569
00:48:00,663 --> 00:48:03,753
Oh, I was... Sorry.

570
00:48:03,833 --> 00:48:06,043
Mucking around with my kids.

571
00:48:08,553 --> 00:48:11,633
Do you feel like working today?

572
00:48:15,893 --> 00:48:19,433
- A Curtis bi-plane.
- I'll put on some hot milk.

573
00:48:19,513 --> 00:48:21,273
Logue. Logue.

574
00:48:21,353 --> 00:48:24,063
I'd kill for something stronger.

575
00:48:28,903 --> 00:48:31,443
I wasn't there
for my father's death.

576
00:48:31,533 --> 00:48:35,703
- Still makes me sad.
- I can imagine so.

577
00:48:37,533 --> 00:48:40,793
- What did your father do?
- He was a brewer.

578
00:48:40,873 --> 00:48:42,833
At least there was free beer.

579
00:48:43,833 --> 00:48:46,583
Here's to the memory of your father.

580
00:48:50,883 --> 00:48:54,973
I was informed, after the fact,

581
00:48:55,053 --> 00:48:57,643
that my father's...

582
00:48:57,723 --> 00:48:59,763
My father's last words were...

583
00:49:01,724 --> 00:49:07,024
..."Bertie has more guts than the
rest of his brothers put together."

584
00:49:10,904 --> 00:49:13,074
He couldn’t say that to my face.

585
00:49:17,914 --> 00:49:19,204
My brother.

586
00:49:21,244 --> 00:49:22,994
What about him?

587
00:49:23,084 --> 00:49:27,214
Try singing it.

588
00:49:27,834 --> 00:49:30,754
- I'm sorry.
- What songs do you know?

589
00:49:30,844 --> 00:49:33,674
- Songs?
- Yeah, songs.

590
00:49:33,764 --> 00:49:35,634
- "Swanee River."
- I love that song.

591
00:49:35,724 --> 00:49:38,264
- It happens to be my favourite.
- Sing me the chorus.

592
00:49:38,344 --> 00:49:40,434
No. Certainly not.

593
00:49:42,144 --> 00:49:46,484
You know...
I always wanted to build models.

594
00:49:47,274 --> 00:49:51,314
But... Father wouldn't allow it.

595
00:49:51,404 --> 00:49:57,074
He... collected stamps,
so we had to collect stamps.

596
00:49:57,744 --> 00:50:01,124
You can finish that off if you sing.

597
00:50:02,084 --> 00:50:06,164
"My brother David
Dum, dum, dum, dum..."

598
00:50:07,165 --> 00:50:11,215
- I'm not going to sit here warbling.
- You can with me.

599
00:50:11,295 --> 00:50:14,715
- Because you're peculiar.
- I take that as a compliment.

600
00:50:15,885 --> 00:50:17,425
Well...

601
00:50:18,885 --> 00:50:20,935
Rules are rules.

602
00:50:24,895 --> 00:50:28,685
I'm not... crooning "Swanee River".

603
00:50:28,775 --> 00:50:32,235
"Camptown Races", then.
"My brother David said to me...

604
00:50:32,315 --> 00:50:34,365
...Doo-dah, doo-dah"

605
00:50:34,445 --> 00:50:37,495
- Continuous sound will give you flow.
- No.

606
00:50:47,795 --> 00:50:51,585
Does it feel strange
now that David's on the throne?

607
00:50:51,675 --> 00:50:55,255
To tell the truth, it was a relief.

608
00:50:55,345 --> 00:50:56,965
Knowing I...

609
00:50:57,055 --> 00:51:00,595
...wouldn't be... King.

610
00:51:00,685 --> 00:51:05,935
But unless he produces an heir,
you're next in line.

611
00:51:06,015 --> 00:51:11,315
And your daughter, Elizabeth,
would then succeed you.

612
00:51:11,396 --> 00:51:15,776
"You're barking up
the wrong tree now, Doctor, Doctor"

613
00:51:15,866 --> 00:51:17,026
"Lionel"

614
00:51:17,116 --> 00:51:19,246
See? You didn't stammer.

615
00:51:19,326 --> 00:51:22,536
Of course I didn't stammer,
I was singing.

616
00:51:23,996 --> 00:51:29,206
Well, as a little reward, you get
to put some glue on these struts.

617
00:51:33,926 --> 00:51:37,386
- Your boy... won't mind?
- No, not at all.

618
00:51:41,476 --> 00:51:45,766
David and I were... very close.

619
00:51:45,856 --> 00:51:48,976
Young bucks, you know.

620
00:51:49,066 --> 00:51:52,276
Did you chase the same girls?

621
00:51:56,156 --> 00:52:01,496
David was always very helpful
in... arranging introductions.

622
00:52:02,616 --> 00:52:04,826
We shared the...

623
00:52:04,916 --> 00:52:08,626
...expert ministrations

624
00:52:08,706 --> 00:52:10,916
Of Paulette in the Palace.

625
00:52:16,757 --> 00:52:19,177
Not at the same time, of course.

626
00:52:23,267 --> 00:52:26,347
- Did David ever tease you?
- Oh, yes, they all did.

627
00:52:26,437 --> 00:52:28,057
"Buh-buh-buh-Bertie."

628
00:52:29,607 --> 00:52:31,527
Father encouraged it.

629
00:52:31,607 --> 00:52:35,857
Said, "Get it out, boy!"
Said it would make me stop.

630
00:52:35,947 --> 00:52:39,027
He said, "I was afraid of my father

631
00:52:39,117 --> 00:52:44,037
and my children are...
damn well gonna be afraid of me!"

632
00:52:45,867 --> 00:52:47,827
Are you naturally right-handed?

633
00:52:51,087 --> 00:52:52,877
Left.

634
00:52:52,957 --> 00:52:57,507
I was... punished,
and now I use the right.

635
00:52:57,587 --> 00:53:00,797
Yes, that's very common with stammerers.

636
00:53:03,597 --> 00:53:08,347
- Any other corrections?
- Knock knees.

637
00:53:08,437 --> 00:53:12,727
Metal splints were made.

638
00:53:12,817 --> 00:53:15,817
Worn... worn day and night.

639
00:53:17,157 --> 00:53:20,567
- Must have been painful.
- Bloody agony.

640
00:53:20,657 --> 00:53:22,987
Straight legs now.

641
00:53:24,828 --> 00:53:27,118
Who were you closest to in your family?

642
00:53:28,118 --> 00:53:29,418
Nannies.

643
00:53:29,498 --> 00:53:31,748
Not my first nanny. She...

644
00:53:31,838 --> 00:53:35,668
She loved David. Hated me.

645
00:53:35,758 --> 00:53:37,218
When we were...

646
00:53:37,928 --> 00:53:40,758
...presented to my parents
for the daily viewing,

647
00:53:40,848 --> 00:53:45,808
she would... she'd pinch me

648
00:53:45,888 --> 00:53:50,478
so that I'd cry and be handed back
to her immediately.

649
00:53:53,398 --> 00:53:55,188
And then she would...

650
00:53:57,858 --> 00:54:00,858
Sing it.

651
00:54:01,698 --> 00:54:05,038
# Then she wouldn't feed me #

652
00:54:05,118 --> 00:54:09,248
# Far, far away #

653
00:54:11,918 --> 00:54:16,418
Took my parents...
three years to notice.

654
00:54:16,508 --> 00:54:22,218
As you... as you can imagine,
caused some stomach problems.

655
00:54:23,218 --> 00:54:24,808
Still.

656
00:54:29,189 --> 00:54:31,769
What about your brother, Johnnie?

657
00:54:33,019 --> 00:54:35,479
Were you close to him?

658
00:54:35,569 --> 00:54:39,899
Johnnie... sweet boy.

659
00:54:41,319 --> 00:54:42,989
Had...

660
00:54:48,579 --> 00:54:50,249
...epilepsy.

661
00:54:51,749 --> 00:54:56,089
And he was... different.

662
00:54:58,339 --> 00:55:01,379
He died at... 13.

663
00:55:02,679 --> 00:55:04,469
Hidden from view.

664
00:55:07,309 --> 00:55:12,309
I'm... I'm told it's not... catching.

665
00:55:14,979 --> 00:55:17,109
Do you want a top-up?

666
00:55:18,359 --> 00:55:19,989
Please.

667
00:55:24,949 --> 00:55:26,329
You know...

668
00:55:26,909 --> 00:55:29,159
...Lionel, you're...

669
00:55:29,249 --> 00:55:31,119
...you're the first
ordinary Englishman...

670
00:55:31,209 --> 00:55:35,789
- Australian.
- ...I've ever really spoken to.

671
00:55:37,420 --> 00:55:40,880
When I'm... driven through the streets

672
00:55:40,970 --> 00:55:45,840
and I see the, you know,
the common man staring at me, I...

673
00:55:47,260 --> 00:55:49,640
...I'm struck by how little
I know of his life

674
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:52,680
and how little he knows of mine.

675
00:55:52,770 --> 00:55:56,190
- Thank you.
- What are friends for?

676
00:55:59,480 --> 00:56:01,240
I wouldn't know.

677
00:56:06,570 --> 00:56:08,240
I sifted seven...

678
00:56:09,620 --> 00:56:13,620
...thick-stalked thistles
through a strong, thick sieve.

679
00:56:13,710 --> 00:56:17,290
- I sifted seven thick-stalked...
- That's enough now, darling.

680
00:56:17,380 --> 00:56:21,050
Listen, I have to keep doing this,
it's awful. I sifted seven...

681
00:56:21,130 --> 00:56:23,470
- Oh, no.
- ...thick-stalked...

682
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:30,720
One-hundred-year-old spruces
removed to improve the view?

683
00:56:30,810 --> 00:56:32,770
Who does she think she is?

684
00:56:32,850 --> 00:56:36,270
Nonetheless, we must try
to be pleasant towards Mrs. Simpson.

685
00:56:36,350 --> 00:56:39,690
- She calls me "The Fat Scottish Cook."
- You're not fat.

686
00:56:39,771 --> 00:56:42,191
I'm getting plump.

687
00:56:43,361 --> 00:56:44,821
Well, you seldom cook.

688
00:56:47,201 --> 00:56:50,241
- I sifted seven...
- Shut up.

689
00:56:50,331 --> 00:56:53,791
...thick sieves...
I sifted seven...

690
00:56:56,621 --> 00:56:59,711
Three, two, one and...

691
00:56:59,791 --> 00:57:02,301
Their Royal Highnesses
the Duke and Duchess of York.

692
00:57:02,381 --> 00:57:06,341
Oh, how lovely to see you both.

693
00:57:07,931 --> 00:57:11,221
Welcome to our little country shack.

694
00:57:12,351 --> 00:57:14,561
I came at the invitation of the King.

695
00:57:19,311 --> 00:57:20,901
Your Majesty.

696
00:57:22,731 --> 00:57:24,651
- You all right?
- Sorry we're late.

697
00:57:24,741 --> 00:57:28,821
Very nice to see you... Mrs. Simpson.

698
00:57:32,411 --> 00:57:33,991
Very nice.

699
00:57:39,081 --> 00:57:42,631
Hello, David. Making some...

700
00:57:43,382 --> 00:57:45,172
...changes to the garden, I see.

701
00:57:45,262 --> 00:57:48,012
Yes, I'm not quite finished yet.

702
00:57:52,142 --> 00:57:54,472
Don't tell me I behaved badly,
Mr. Churchill.

703
00:57:54,562 --> 00:57:56,932
On the contrary, Your Royal Highness.

704
00:57:57,022 --> 00:58:00,272
Etiquette decrees that royalty
should be greeted by the official host,

705
00:58:00,362 --> 00:58:03,152
in this case, the King. Not a commoner.

706
00:58:03,232 --> 00:58:05,442
Thank you.

707
00:58:07,782 --> 00:58:11,452
- What is her hold on him?
- I've no idea.

708
00:58:13,832 --> 00:58:17,202
Apparently, she has certain skills

709
00:58:17,292 --> 00:58:20,832
acquired in an establishment
in Shanghai.

710
00:58:23,342 --> 00:58:25,422
David.

711
00:58:26,712 --> 00:58:29,472
Just be a sec, darling.
Would you excuse me?

712
00:58:39,692 --> 00:58:44,482
- David, I've been trying to see you.
- I've been terribly busy.

713
00:58:44,572 --> 00:58:47,072
- Doing what?
- Kinging.

714
00:58:47,152 --> 00:58:51,822
Really? Kinging is a...

715
00:58:51,913 --> 00:58:54,783
...a precarious business these days.
Where's the Russian tsar?

716
00:58:54,873 --> 00:58:58,583
- Where's cousin Wilhelm?
- You're being dreary.

717
00:58:58,663 --> 00:59:03,833
Is kinging laying off 80... staff
and buying more pearls for Wallis,

718
00:59:03,923 --> 00:59:06,673
while people are marching across Europe
singing The Red Flag?

719
00:59:06,753 --> 00:59:09,593
- Herr Hitler will sort them out.
- Who will sort out Herr Hitler?

720
00:59:09,673 --> 00:59:12,343
Where's the bloody 23?

721
00:59:12,433 --> 00:59:14,263
And you put that woman
in our mother's suite!

722
00:59:14,353 --> 00:59:17,473
- Mama's not still in the bed, is she?
- That's not funny.

723
00:59:17,563 --> 00:59:20,933
Here it is. Wallis likes the very best.

724
00:59:21,023 --> 00:59:23,563
I don't care what woman
you carry on with at night,

725
00:59:23,653 --> 00:59:26,443
as long as you... show up
for duty in the morning.

726
00:59:26,523 --> 00:59:29,653
Wallis is not just some woman
I'm carrying on with.

727
00:59:29,743 --> 00:59:31,493
We intend to marry.

728
00:59:33,033 --> 00:59:37,283
- Excuse me?
- She's filing a petition for divorce.

729
00:59:37,373 --> 00:59:38,993
Good God.

730
00:59:40,543 --> 00:59:43,373
Can't you just give her
a nice house and a title?

731
00:59:43,463 --> 00:59:46,343
- I'm not having her as my mistress.
- The Church doesn't recognize divorce,

732
00:59:46,423 --> 00:59:50,553
- and you are the... head of the Church.
- Haven't I any rights?

733
00:59:50,633 --> 00:59:52,843
- Many privileges.
- Not the same thing.

734
00:59:53,894 --> 00:59:56,474
Your beloved common man
may marry for love. Why not me?

735
00:59:56,554 --> 00:59:59,264
If you were... a common man,

736
00:59:59,354 --> 01:00:02,484
On what basis could you...
possibly claim to be King?

737
01:00:02,564 --> 01:00:04,194
Sounds like you've
studied our wretched Constitution.

738
01:00:04,274 --> 01:00:06,864
- Sounds like you haven't.
- That's what this is about.

739
01:00:06,944 --> 01:00:10,574
Brushing up.
Hence, the elocution lessons.

740
01:00:10,654 --> 01:00:14,534
- That's the scoop around town.
- I'm trying to...

741
01:00:18,454 --> 01:00:20,994
Yearning for a larger audience,
are we, B-B-Bertie?

742
01:00:23,874 --> 01:00:26,044
Don't...

743
01:00:26,134 --> 01:00:28,094
What's that?

744
01:00:28,174 --> 01:00:31,004
I'm sorry, I...

745
01:00:31,094 --> 01:00:34,554
Younger brother trying to push
older brother off the throne.

746
01:00:34,634 --> 01:00:36,934
P-P-Positively mediaeval.

747
01:00:37,974 --> 01:00:40,014
Wallis.

748
01:00:40,104 --> 01:00:43,524
Ah. Where have you been all this time?

749
01:00:43,604 --> 01:00:46,354
- Who have you been talking to?
- Never you mind.

750
01:00:48,444 --> 01:00:53,404
What a very complicated
little King you are.

751
01:00:53,494 --> 01:00:55,704
I try to be.

752
01:00:56,534 --> 01:00:59,954
All that work... down the drain.

753
01:01:01,295 --> 01:01:02,745
My own brother.

754
01:01:02,835 --> 01:01:06,165
I couldn't say a single word
to him in reply.

755
01:01:06,255 --> 01:01:09,385
Why do you stammer so much more
with David than you ever do with me?

756
01:01:09,465 --> 01:01:11,675
Because you're bloody well
paid to listen.

757
01:01:11,755 --> 01:01:15,725
- Bertie, I'm not a geisha girl.
- Stop trying to be so bloody clever.

758
01:01:15,805 --> 01:01:19,145
What is it about David
that stops you speaking?

759
01:01:19,225 --> 01:01:22,145
What is it about you that bloody
well makes you want to go on about him

760
01:01:22,225 --> 01:01:25,065
- the whole bloody time?
- Vulgar but fluent.

761
01:01:25,145 --> 01:01:27,895
- You don't stammer when you swear.
- Bugger off!

762
01:01:27,985 --> 01:01:31,865
- Is that the best you can do?
- Well, bloody...

763
01:01:31,945 --> 01:01:35,405
...bugger to you, you beastly bastard.

764
01:01:35,495 --> 01:01:38,865
Oh, a public school prig
could do better than that.

765
01:01:39,495 --> 01:01:40,575
Shit.

766
01:01:41,335 --> 01:01:42,455
Shit, shit, shit.

767
01:01:42,545 --> 01:01:45,755
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit!

768
01:01:45,835 --> 01:01:49,715
Yes, defecation flows
trippingly from the tongue.

769
01:01:49,795 --> 01:01:51,845
- Because I'm angry!
- Do you know the "f" word?

770
01:01:53,845 --> 01:01:57,555
- Fornication?
- Oh, Bertie.

771
01:01:57,635 --> 01:02:00,225
Fuck. Fuck!

772
01:02:00,305 --> 01:02:03,435
Fuck, fuck, fuckin' fuck!
Fuck, fuck and bugger!

773
01:02:03,515 --> 01:02:05,565
Bugger, bugger, buggedy, fuck!

774
01:02:05,646 --> 01:02:06,936
- Fuck, ass!
- Yes!

775
01:02:07,026 --> 01:02:09,696
- Balls, balls, fuckety shit.
- You see? Not a hesitation.

776
01:02:09,776 --> 01:02:12,446
Willy, shit and fuck! And tits.

777
01:02:12,526 --> 01:02:16,236
- Dad, what's going on?
- Sorry.

778
01:02:16,326 --> 01:02:17,826
Just finish your homework.

779
01:02:18,996 --> 01:02:21,626
Well, that's a side of you
we don't get to see all that often.

780
01:02:22,456 --> 01:02:23,496
No.

781
01:02:23,586 --> 01:02:26,836
No, we're not supposed to, really.
Not publicly.

782
01:02:27,546 --> 01:02:32,006
- Let's get some air.
- No, I don't think that's a good idea.

783
01:02:33,716 --> 01:02:37,806
What's the matter?
Why are you so upset?

784
01:02:37,886 --> 01:02:41,646
Logue, you have no idea.

785
01:02:41,726 --> 01:02:44,816
My... my brother

786
01:02:44,896 --> 01:02:48,236
is infatuated with a...

787
01:02:48,316 --> 01:02:49,816
...woman who's been married twice.

788
01:02:49,896 --> 01:02:53,986
She's asking for a divorce,
and he's determined to marry her.

789
01:02:54,076 --> 01:02:58,616
- Jesus.
- Mrs. Wallis Simpson...

790
01:02:58,696 --> 01:03:01,666
- ...of Baltimore.
- That's not right.

791
01:03:01,746 --> 01:03:04,996
- Queen Wallis of Baltimore.
- Unthinkable.

792
01:03:05,086 --> 01:03:08,836
- Can he do it?
- Absolutely not.

793
01:03:08,917 --> 01:03:13,047
But he's going to anyway.
All hell's broken loose.

794
01:03:13,137 --> 01:03:16,757
- Can't they just carry on privately?
- If only they would.

795
01:03:18,677 --> 01:03:20,887
Where does this leave you?

796
01:03:22,847 --> 01:03:25,477
I know my place. I...

797
01:03:25,567 --> 01:03:28,857
I... I will do anything...

798
01:03:28,937 --> 01:03:31,857
...in my power to keep
my brother on the throne.

799
01:03:32,987 --> 01:03:34,907
Is it that serious?

800
01:03:36,157 --> 01:03:40,287
- Your place may well be on the throne.
- I am not an alternative to my brother.

801
01:03:40,367 --> 01:03:43,117
- You can outshine David.
- Don't take liberties!

802
01:03:44,167 --> 01:03:46,707
- That's bordering on treason.
- I'm just saying you could be King.

803
01:03:46,787 --> 01:03:48,667
- You could do it.
- That is treason.

804
01:03:48,747 --> 01:03:50,707
I'm trying to get you to realize
you needn't be governed by fear.

805
01:03:50,797 --> 01:03:52,547
I've had enough of this.

806
01:03:53,797 --> 01:03:56,087
- What are you so afraid of?
- Your poisonous words!

807
01:03:56,177 --> 01:03:58,887
Why did you come to me?
You're not some middle-class banker

808
01:03:58,967 --> 01:04:00,887
who wants elocution lessons
so you can chitchat...

809
01:04:00,977 --> 01:04:04,267
Don't attempt to instruct me
on my duties!

810
01:04:04,347 --> 01:04:08,517
I am the son of a... King.

811
01:04:08,607 --> 01:04:11,357
And the brother of... of a King.

812
01:04:11,437 --> 01:04:14,697
You're the disappointing son
of a brewer.

813
01:04:14,778 --> 01:04:18,068
A jumped-up jackeroo from the outback.

814
01:04:18,778 --> 01:04:22,288
You're a nobody.
These sessions are over.

815
01:05:00,328 --> 01:05:01,948
Through here, sir.

816
01:05:04,828 --> 01:05:09,248
It's not because she's an
American. That is the least of it.

817
01:05:09,338 --> 01:05:14,298
It's because she's a soon
to be twice divorced American.

818
01:05:14,378 --> 01:05:18,548
And the King,
as head of the Church of England,

819
01:05:18,638 --> 01:05:22,058
cannot marry a divorced woman.

820
01:05:23,429 --> 01:05:26,059
And, sir, I apologize
for the nature of this.

821
01:05:27,849 --> 01:05:30,729
According to Scotland Yard,

822
01:05:30,819 --> 01:05:35,899
the King has not always
possessed exclusive rights

823
01:05:35,989 --> 01:05:41,069
to Mrs. Simpson's...
favors and affections...

824
01:05:42,409 --> 01:05:45,329
...sharing them with a
married used car salesman,

825
01:05:45,409 --> 01:05:48,329
a certain Mr. Guy Trundle.

826
01:05:50,079 --> 01:05:54,419
In addition, it is also
rumoured Hitler's ambassador,

827
01:05:54,509 --> 01:05:59,179
Count von Ribbentrop,
sends her 17 carnations every day.

828
01:06:00,679 --> 01:06:04,509
Should His Majesty continue to ignore
the advice of his government,

829
01:06:04,599 --> 01:06:06,349
he must abdicate.

830
01:06:06,429 --> 01:06:09,889
Otherwise, his government
has no choice but to resign.

831
01:06:09,979 --> 01:06:13,059
Prime Minister,
you'd leave a country without a...

832
01:06:15,439 --> 01:06:16,439
...a government?

833
01:06:17,949 --> 01:06:20,609
Does the King do what he wants?

834
01:06:21,369 --> 01:06:24,779
Or does he do what
the people expect him to do?

835
01:06:24,870 --> 01:06:27,450
As crowds in Downing
Street watch ministers come and go,

836
01:06:27,540 --> 01:06:30,960
there is raised an age-old problem:
Can a king separate his personal life

837
01:06:31,040 --> 01:06:33,500
- from his public duty...
- What's the matter, love?

838
01:06:33,590 --> 01:06:36,380
I'm just having trouble with a patient.

839
01:06:38,300 --> 01:06:40,380
That isn't like you.

840
01:06:41,640 --> 01:06:45,350
- Why?
- He's scared.

841
01:06:46,100 --> 01:06:48,180
He's afraid of his own shadow.

842
01:06:49,190 --> 01:06:51,140
Isn't that why they come to you?

843
01:06:53,650 --> 01:06:56,230
This fellow could
really be somebody great.

844
01:06:56,320 --> 01:06:58,690
He's fighting me.

845
01:06:58,780 --> 01:07:01,320
Perhaps he doesn't want to be great.

846
01:07:04,200 --> 01:07:06,410
Perhaps that's what you want.

847
01:07:10,500 --> 01:07:12,870
I might have overstepped the mark.

848
01:07:14,340 --> 01:07:17,840
Apologize. Do you both good.

849
01:07:29,310 --> 01:07:32,390
I'm very sorry, Mr. Logue,
the Duke is busy.

850
01:07:33,351 --> 01:07:36,731
I'm happy to wait.
Or I could come back later.

851
01:07:36,821 --> 01:07:40,321
As I said, the Duke is terribly busy.

852
01:07:49,161 --> 01:07:56,881
Thank you.

853
01:08:03,681 --> 01:08:06,721
Parliament will not support
the marriage.

854
01:08:09,141 --> 01:08:12,141
But there are other reasons for concern.

855
01:08:12,231 --> 01:08:15,561
He was careless with state papers.
He lacked commitment and resolve,

856
01:08:15,651 --> 01:08:18,271
and there are those who are
worried about where he will stand

857
01:08:18,361 --> 01:08:20,731
when war comes with Germany.

858
01:08:22,991 --> 01:08:26,821
- We're not coming to that?
- Indeed we are, sir.

859
01:08:26,911 --> 01:08:32,081
Prime Minister Baldwin may deny this,
but Hitler's intent is crystal clear.

860
01:08:32,161 --> 01:08:34,831
War with Germany will come.

861
01:08:34,921 --> 01:08:39,251
And we will need a King
whom we can all stand behind, united.

862
01:08:39,342 --> 01:08:42,052
I fear my...

863
01:08:43,222 --> 01:08:45,512
...brother is not of sound mind...

864
01:08:46,802 --> 01:08:48,472
...at this time.

865
01:08:48,552 --> 01:08:52,432
Have you thought
what you will call yourself? Hmm?

866
01:08:58,312 --> 01:09:04,112
Certainly not Albert, sir.
Too Germanic.

867
01:09:09,952 --> 01:09:13,952
What about George?
After your father?

868
01:09:15,252 --> 01:09:19,882
George the Sixth
has a rather nice continuity to it.

869
01:09:19,962 --> 01:09:21,042
Don't you think?

870
01:09:24,762 --> 01:09:27,882
David. Thank God.

871
01:09:27,972 --> 01:09:30,352
You look exhausted.

872
01:09:32,642 --> 01:09:34,642
How are you bearing up?

873
01:09:34,732 --> 01:09:37,232
Bertie, the decision's been made. I...

874
01:09:37,812 --> 01:09:39,982
I'm going.

875
01:09:41,653 --> 01:09:44,823
- I can't accept that...
- I'm afraid there's no other way.

876
01:09:46,493 --> 01:09:48,533
I must marry her.

877
01:09:50,993 --> 01:09:54,163
My mind's made up. I'm... sorry.

878
01:09:57,413 --> 01:09:59,503
That's a terrible thing to hear.

879
01:10:02,843 --> 01:10:04,343
Nobody wants that.

880
01:10:05,263 --> 01:10:06,843
I, least of all.

881
01:10:12,813 --> 01:10:14,933
At long last,

882
01:10:15,023 --> 01:10:18,733
I am able to say a few words of my own.

883
01:10:19,983 --> 01:10:23,733
I have never wanted
to withhold anything,

884
01:10:23,823 --> 01:10:27,073
but until now it has not been
constitutionally possible

885
01:10:27,153 --> 01:10:28,443
for me to speak.

886
01:10:29,363 --> 01:10:33,743
A few hours ago,
I discharged my last duty

887
01:10:33,833 --> 01:10:37,623
as King and Emperor,

888
01:10:37,713 --> 01:10:42,133
and now that I have been succeeded
by my brother,

889
01:10:42,213 --> 01:10:44,043
the Duke of York,

890
01:10:44,133 --> 01:10:47,963
my first words must be
to declare my allegiance to him.

891
01:10:48,054 --> 01:10:51,804
This I do with all my heart.

892
01:10:54,514 --> 01:10:59,394
You all know the reasons which have
impelled me to renounce the throne,

893
01:10:59,484 --> 01:11:03,404
but you must believe me when I tell you

894
01:11:03,484 --> 01:11:06,654
that I have found it impossible
to carry the heavy burden

895
01:11:06,734 --> 01:11:10,864
Of responsibility
and to discharge my duties as King,

896
01:11:10,954 --> 01:11:13,324
as I would wish to do

897
01:11:13,414 --> 01:11:18,244
without the help and support
of the woman I love.

898
01:11:19,164 --> 01:11:21,164
And I want you to know,

899
01:11:21,254 --> 01:11:26,174
this decision has been
made less difficult to me

900
01:11:26,254 --> 01:11:29,094
by the sure knowledge that my brother,

901
01:11:29,174 --> 01:11:32,344
with his long training
in the public affairs of this country,

902
01:11:32,434 --> 01:11:36,514
and with his fine qualities,

903
01:11:36,604 --> 01:11:39,274
will be able to take my place forthwith

904
01:11:39,354 --> 01:11:43,944
without interruption or injury

905
01:11:44,024 --> 01:11:47,944
to the life and progress of the Empire.

906
01:13:04,186 --> 01:13:06,196
I meet you today...

907
01:13:08,486 --> 01:13:09,866
...in...

908
01:13:12,866 --> 01:13:15,956
...in circumstances which are...

909
01:13:33,056 --> 01:13:34,966
- I'm sure you'll love it.
- There you go.

910
01:13:35,056 --> 01:13:37,056
Thank you, darling.
Saddles. Margaret.

911
01:13:37,136 --> 01:13:40,476
- There's Montezuma.
- Oh, here's one.

912
01:13:40,556 --> 01:13:44,396
- Mama, here's a horse and saddle.
- Thank you. Oops.

913
01:13:44,486 --> 01:13:47,606
- Don't worry, Sally. We'll get you...
- Mama?

914
01:13:47,696 --> 01:13:49,446
- Yes?
- Will we have space for our horses...

915
01:13:49,526 --> 01:13:50,986
- ...in our new home?
- Course we will, darling.

916
01:13:51,066 --> 01:13:52,526
We'll have a palace of rooms.

917
01:14:02,497 --> 01:14:04,297
Curtsey.

918
01:14:06,167 --> 01:14:07,757
Your Majesty.

919
01:14:24,607 --> 01:14:26,227
How was it?

920
01:14:37,287 --> 01:14:42,417
I was trying to...
familiarize myself

921
01:14:42,497 --> 01:14:46,127
with... what a state paper looks like.

922
01:14:47,127 --> 01:14:48,587
It's a...

923
01:14:50,337 --> 01:14:55,137
...dispatch from Mr. Baldwin,
which I don't understand a word of.

924
01:14:58,347 --> 01:15:00,227
David's finances.

925
01:15:03,057 --> 01:15:08,777
Christmas... broadcast.

926
01:15:09,948 --> 01:15:13,158
- Think that would be a mistake.
- No, don't worry about that.

927
01:15:13,238 --> 01:15:15,118
Oh.

928
01:15:24,248 --> 01:15:26,208
Plans for the Coronation.

929
01:15:27,548 --> 01:15:30,168
Think that would be
an even bigger mistake.

930
01:15:32,628 --> 01:15:35,048
- I'm not a King.
- Oh, shush.

931
01:15:39,428 --> 01:15:42,388
I'm a Naval officer. That's all I know.

932
01:15:44,768 --> 01:15:47,648
I'm not a King. I'm not a King.

933
01:15:48,318 --> 01:15:50,938
- I'm sorry.
- No.

934
01:15:51,028 --> 01:15:53,858
- I'm sorry.
- No, don't be silly. Please.

935
01:15:56,578 --> 01:15:58,698
Oh, my dear.

936
01:15:58,788 --> 01:16:01,328
My dear, dear man.

937
01:16:02,038 --> 01:16:05,918
- I'm sorry.
- You know,

938
01:16:05,998 --> 01:16:09,798
I refused your first
two marriage proposals,

939
01:16:09,878 --> 01:16:12,468
not because I didn't love you,

940
01:16:12,548 --> 01:16:15,638
but because I couldn't bear
the idea of a Royal life.

941
01:16:15,719 --> 01:16:20,429
Couldn't bear the idea of a life
of tours, public duty, of...

942
01:16:20,519 --> 01:16:24,729
Well, a life that no longer
was really to be my own.

943
01:16:25,399 --> 01:16:31,149
But then I thought, he stammers
so beautifully, they'll leave us alone.

944
01:16:57,429 --> 01:17:02,519
Waiting for a King to apologize,
one can wait rather a long wait.

945
01:17:06,849 --> 01:17:09,479
I'm afraid we're slightly late.

946
01:17:11,779 --> 01:17:14,189
This is home.

947
01:17:14,279 --> 01:17:17,199
Myrtle's at bridge.
I made sure the boys were out.

948
01:17:17,279 --> 01:17:20,699
It's lovely. Absolutely lovely.

949
01:17:20,780 --> 01:17:24,330
- Oh! May I sit down?
- Yes, of course.

950
01:17:31,590 --> 01:17:34,670
- Would you like some tea, ma'am?
- Yes, I'll help myself.

951
01:17:34,760 --> 01:17:37,970
Now, off you go.
Or must I knock your heads together?

952
01:17:39,590 --> 01:17:41,350
Here's your shilling.

953
01:17:49,270 --> 01:17:50,690
I...

954
01:17:52,190 --> 01:17:54,230
I understand...

955
01:17:54,940 --> 01:17:57,490
...what you were trying to say, Logue.

956
01:17:58,160 --> 01:18:00,490
I went about it the wrong way.

957
01:18:01,370 --> 01:18:02,870
I'm sorry.

958
01:18:04,370 --> 01:18:06,410
So, here I am.

959
01:18:06,500 --> 01:18:12,210
Is the nation ready for two...
minutes of radio silence?

960
01:18:12,290 --> 01:18:15,880
Every stammerer always fears
going back to square one.

961
01:18:15,960 --> 01:18:17,760
I don't let that happen.

962
01:18:17,840 --> 01:18:21,220
If I fail in my duty,

963
01:18:21,300 --> 01:18:25,890
David could come back.
I've seen the placards.

964
01:18:25,971 --> 01:18:30,271
"God save our... King."

965
01:18:30,351 --> 01:18:32,151
They don't mean me.

966
01:18:33,231 --> 01:18:36,941
Every monarch in history

967
01:18:37,031 --> 01:18:40,701
has succeeded someone who's dead

968
01:18:40,781 --> 01:18:43,491
Or just about to be.

969
01:18:45,491 --> 01:18:51,211
My predecessor is not only alive,
but very much so.

970
01:18:55,171 --> 01:18:56,961
It's a bloody mess.

971
01:18:58,171 --> 01:19:00,551
Couldn't even give them
a Christmas speech.

972
01:19:00,631 --> 01:19:03,641
- Like your dad used to do?
- Precisely.

973
01:19:03,721 --> 01:19:06,351
He's not here anymore.

974
01:19:08,891 --> 01:19:11,481
Yes, he is.
He's on that shilling I gave you.

975
01:19:11,561 --> 01:19:15,691
Easy enough to give away.

976
01:19:15,771 --> 01:19:18,821
You don't have to carry him
around in your pocket.

977
01:19:18,901 --> 01:19:20,401
Or your brother.

978
01:19:20,491 --> 01:19:24,241
You don't need to be afraid
of the things you were afraid of

979
01:19:24,321 --> 01:19:26,831
when you were five.

980
01:19:32,422 --> 01:19:34,832
You're very much your own man, Bertie.

981
01:19:36,342 --> 01:19:37,922
Am I?

982
01:19:42,302 --> 01:19:44,932
- Your face is next, mate.
- Lionel, dear!

983
01:19:46,012 --> 01:19:47,012
Myrtle.

984
01:19:47,102 --> 01:19:50,642
- Is this your wife?
- Yes.

985
01:19:51,182 --> 01:19:53,272
Bertie. Come here.

986
01:19:54,602 --> 01:19:57,272
- Are you all right, Logue?
- Yes.

987
01:19:59,362 --> 01:20:02,532
- Shouldn't we go through?
- Trust me, it's important.

988
01:20:04,032 --> 01:20:07,702
- What is it?
- Oh!

989
01:20:07,782 --> 01:20:10,292
- You're...
- It's "Your Majesty" the first time.

990
01:20:10,372 --> 01:20:12,712
After that, it's "Ma'am." As in "ham."

991
01:20:12,792 --> 01:20:14,462
Not "malm" as in "palm."

992
01:20:15,922 --> 01:20:18,042
I haven't told her about us.

993
01:20:18,132 --> 01:20:19,922
Sit down, relax.

994
01:20:20,012 --> 01:20:24,512
I'm told your husband
calls my husband Bertie.

995
01:20:24,592 --> 01:20:26,932
And my husband calls
your husband Lionel.

996
01:20:27,012 --> 01:20:28,512
I trust you won't call me Liz.

997
01:20:29,562 --> 01:20:33,522
Your Majesty, you may
call me Mrs. Logue, ma'am.

998
01:20:33,602 --> 01:20:35,482
Very nice to meet you, Mrs. Logue.

999
01:20:37,983 --> 01:20:40,113
- Logue, we can't stay here all day.
- Yes, we can.

1000
01:20:40,193 --> 01:20:42,363
- Logue!
- I need to wait for the right moment.

1001
01:20:42,443 --> 01:20:45,283
- Logue, you're being a coward.
- You're damn right.

1002
01:20:47,033 --> 01:20:48,203
Get out there, man.

1003
01:20:50,543 --> 01:20:52,953
Hello, Myrtle, darling.

1004
01:20:53,753 --> 01:20:55,083
You're early.

1005
01:20:55,173 --> 01:20:59,213
I believe you two have met,
but I don't think you know...

1006
01:21:00,343 --> 01:21:04,053
...king George the Sixth.
- It's very nice to meet you.

1007
01:21:07,973 --> 01:21:11,143
Will Their Majesties
be staying to dinner?

1008
01:21:12,223 --> 01:21:16,273
We'd love to, such a treat,
but alas a...

1009
01:21:16,353 --> 01:21:19,103
...previous engagement. What a pity.

1010
01:21:34,203 --> 01:21:37,833
- Archbishop.
- Welcome, Your Majesty.

1011
01:21:38,383 --> 01:21:41,753
What a glorious transformation, sir.

1012
01:21:41,844 --> 01:21:45,214
I hope you'll forgive us
if we continue our preparations?

1013
01:21:46,224 --> 01:21:52,014
Now, allow me to guide you
through the ceremony.

1014
01:21:56,234 --> 01:22:01,314
We begin, of course,
at the West door into the nave.

1015
01:22:02,774 --> 01:22:06,824
I see all your pronouncements
are to be broadcast, Archbishop.

1016
01:22:06,904 --> 01:22:09,364
Ah, yes. Wireless.

1017
01:22:09,454 --> 01:22:11,824
It is, indeed, a Pandora's box,

1018
01:22:11,914 --> 01:22:16,124
and I'm afraid I've also had
to permit the newsreel cameras.

1019
01:22:16,204 --> 01:22:19,834
The product of which
I shall personally edit.

1020
01:22:19,924 --> 01:22:22,424
Without momentary hesitations.

1021
01:22:22,504 --> 01:22:26,214
This is Dr. Logue of Harley Street.

1022
01:22:26,304 --> 01:22:30,094
He's... my speech therapist.

1023
01:22:30,644 --> 01:22:33,934
- Your Grace.
- Had I known that Your Majesty

1024
01:22:34,014 --> 01:22:37,024
was seeking assistance, I should
have made my own recommendation.

1025
01:22:37,104 --> 01:22:39,524
Dr. Logue will...

1026
01:22:40,404 --> 01:22:42,484
...will be attending the Coronation.

1027
01:22:42,564 --> 01:22:47,364
Of course I'll speak to the Dean,
but it will be extremely difficult.

1028
01:22:47,445 --> 01:22:49,285
I should like the...

1029
01:22:50,825 --> 01:22:54,415
...doctor to be seated in the...

1030
01:22:54,495 --> 01:22:55,705
...King's Box.

1031
01:22:56,705 --> 01:22:59,795
But members of your family
will be seated there, sir.

1032
01:22:59,875 --> 01:23:01,675
That is why it is suitable.

1033
01:23:03,925 --> 01:23:05,925
And now, if you don't mind, Your Grace,
we need the premises.

1034
01:23:06,005 --> 01:23:08,555
My dear fellow,
this is Westminster Abbey.

1035
01:23:08,635 --> 01:23:10,675
The Church must prepare His Majesty.

1036
01:23:10,765 --> 01:23:13,685
My preparations are equally
as important.

1037
01:23:17,815 --> 01:23:20,645
With complete privacy,
if you don't mind.

1038
01:23:22,405 --> 01:23:24,655
Those are my wishes, Your Grace.

1039
01:23:25,865 --> 01:23:29,865
I will place the Abbey
at Your Majesty's disposal,

1040
01:23:29,945 --> 01:23:33,495
this evening. Your Majesty.

1041
01:24:04,026 --> 01:24:07,986
I can't believe I'm walking
on Chaucer and Handel and Dickens.

1042
01:24:11,496 --> 01:24:13,576
Everything all right?
Let's get cracking.

1043
01:24:15,376 --> 01:24:19,456
I'm not here to rehearse, Dr. Logue.

1044
01:24:22,126 --> 01:24:24,046
Call me Lionel.

1045
01:24:25,046 --> 01:24:29,216
True, you... never...

1046
01:24:30,176 --> 01:24:32,636
...called yourself Doctor. I did that...

1047
01:24:35,056 --> 01:24:36,186
...for you.

1048
01:24:39,226 --> 01:24:40,976
No training.

1049
01:24:41,066 --> 01:24:43,896
No diploma, no...

1050
01:24:46,986 --> 01:24:48,446
...qualifications.

1051
01:24:48,526 --> 01:24:52,366
Just... a great deal of nerve.

1052
01:24:53,406 --> 01:24:55,786
The Star Chamber inquisition, is it?

1053
01:24:55,867 --> 01:24:57,787
You asked for trust.

1054
01:24:57,877 --> 01:25:02,337
And... total equality.

1055
01:25:02,417 --> 01:25:05,837
Bertie, I heard you at Wembley.
I was there.

1056
01:25:06,927 --> 01:25:09,597
My son Laurie said, "Dad, do you think
you could help that poor man?"

1057
01:25:09,677 --> 01:25:13,137
- What, as a failed actor?
- It's true.

1058
01:25:13,217 --> 01:25:18,897
I'm not a doctor.
And yes, I acted, a bit.

1059
01:25:19,307 --> 01:25:23,437
Well, I recited in pubs.
I taught elocution in schools.

1060
01:25:23,527 --> 01:25:25,107
When the Great War came,

1061
01:25:25,197 --> 01:25:27,737
all our soldiers were returning
to Australia from the front,

1062
01:25:27,817 --> 01:25:31,447
a lot of them shell-shocked,
unable to speak.

1063
01:25:31,527 --> 01:25:33,947
Somebody said, Lionel,
"You're very good at this speech stuff.

1064
01:25:34,037 --> 01:25:36,707
Do you think you could possibly
help these poor buggers?"

1065
01:25:37,917 --> 01:25:40,497
I did muscle therapy,
exercises, relaxation,

1066
01:25:40,587 --> 01:25:42,837
but I knew I had to go deeper.

1067
01:25:44,417 --> 01:25:46,837
Those poor young blokes
had cried out in fear.

1068
01:25:46,927 --> 01:25:49,177
No one was listening to them.

1069
01:25:50,717 --> 01:25:53,807
My job was to give them faith
in their own voice,

1070
01:25:53,887 --> 01:25:57,517
and let them know that
a friend was listening.

1071
01:25:58,847 --> 01:26:01,937
That must ring
a few bells with you, Bertie.

1072
01:26:06,318 --> 01:26:08,528
You give a very noble
account of yourself.

1073
01:26:08,608 --> 01:26:12,568
- Make inquiries. It's all true.
- Inquiries have been made.

1074
01:26:12,658 --> 01:26:16,408
You have no idea who I have
breathing down my neck.

1075
01:26:17,578 --> 01:26:20,168
I vouched for you, and you have no...

1076
01:26:23,248 --> 01:26:25,668
- ...credentials.
- But lots of success.

1077
01:26:25,758 --> 01:26:29,088
I can't show you a certificate.
There was no training then.

1078
01:26:29,178 --> 01:26:31,008
Everything I know,
I know from experience.

1079
01:26:31,088 --> 01:26:34,718
And that war was some experience.

1080
01:26:37,178 --> 01:26:39,428
My plaque says,
"L. Logue, Speech Defects."

1081
01:26:39,518 --> 01:26:42,518
Not "Doctor."
There are no letters after my name.

1082
01:26:47,318 --> 01:26:49,948
- Lock me in the Tower.
- I would if I could.

1083
01:26:50,028 --> 01:26:51,698
- On what charge?
- Fraud.

1084
01:26:51,778 --> 01:26:55,448
With war looming, you've saddled
this nation with a voiceless...

1085
01:26:55,538 --> 01:26:59,788
...King. You've destroyed
the happiness of my family,

1086
01:26:59,868 --> 01:27:05,088
all for the sake of ensnaring
a star... patient you couldn't...

1087
01:27:05,168 --> 01:27:07,668
...possibly hope to assist.

1088
01:27:08,719 --> 01:27:10,719
It'll be like mad...

1089
01:27:12,589 --> 01:27:14,639
...King George the Third.

1090
01:27:15,639 --> 01:27:19,059
I'll be... Mad King...

1091
01:27:20,099 --> 01:27:22,349
...George the Stammerer...

1092
01:27:24,229 --> 01:27:27,899
...who let his people down
so badly in their hour of need.

1093
01:27:28,899 --> 01:27:31,489
What are you doing? Get up!
You can't sit there! Get up!

1094
01:27:31,569 --> 01:27:34,489
- Why not? It's a chair.
- No, it... That is not a chair!

1095
01:27:34,569 --> 01:27:36,579
That is... That...

1096
01:27:36,659 --> 01:27:40,329
- That is Saint Edward's chair.
- People have carved their names on it.

1097
01:27:40,409 --> 01:27:41,999
That chair is the seat
on which every King...

1098
01:27:42,079 --> 01:27:45,629
- It's held in place by a large rock.
- That is the Stone of Scone!

1099
01:27:45,709 --> 01:27:50,339
- You are trivializing everything.
- I don't care how many royal assholes

1100
01:27:50,419 --> 01:27:52,419
- ...have sat on this chair.
- Listen to me! Listen to me!

1101
01:27:52,509 --> 01:27:54,799
- Listen to you? By what right?
- By Divine Right, if you must.

1102
01:27:54,889 --> 01:27:56,009
- I am your King!
- No, you're not.

1103
01:27:56,099 --> 01:27:58,389
You told me so yourself.
You said you didn't want it.

1104
01:27:58,469 --> 01:27:59,769
Why should I waste my time
listening to you?

1105
01:27:59,849 --> 01:28:02,979
Because I have a right to be heard!
I have a voice!

1106
01:28:08,319 --> 01:28:09,939
Yes, you do.

1107
01:28:19,580 --> 01:28:23,540
You have such perseverance, Bertie.
You're the bravest man I know.

1108
01:28:23,620 --> 01:28:25,920
You'll make a bloody good King.

1109
01:28:33,510 --> 01:28:37,470
- What on earth is going on, sir?
- It's quite all right, Archbishop.

1110
01:28:37,550 --> 01:28:39,220
Mr. Logue, you must know that

1111
01:28:39,310 --> 01:28:43,100
I've found a replacement English
specialist with impeccable credentials.

1112
01:28:43,180 --> 01:28:46,730
Hence, your services
will no longer be required.

1113
01:28:46,810 --> 01:28:48,770
- I'm sorry?
- Your Majesty's function

1114
01:28:48,860 --> 01:28:51,820
is to consult and be advised.
Now, you didn't consult,

1115
01:28:51,900 --> 01:28:57,200
- ...but you have just been advised.
- And now I advise you.

1116
01:28:57,280 --> 01:29:03,200
In this personal matter,
I will make my own decision.

1117
01:29:03,370 --> 01:29:08,040
My concern is for the head
on which I must place the crown.

1118
01:29:08,130 --> 01:29:10,250
I appreciate that, Archbishop.

1119
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:13,840
But it's my head.

1120
01:29:15,090 --> 01:29:17,050
Your humble servant.

1121
01:29:24,271 --> 01:29:25,851
Thank you, Bertie.

1122
01:29:28,231 --> 01:29:31,691
Shall we rehearse? Come on.
Up on your perch.

1123
01:29:39,121 --> 01:29:42,281
Now, when you and Elizabeth
enter through the West door,

1124
01:29:42,371 --> 01:29:46,501
you will be greeted by the hymn
"I was glad when they said unto me."

1125
01:29:46,581 --> 01:29:49,881
Actually, you won't be that glad because
they do sing it for a very long time.

1126
01:29:51,541 --> 01:29:56,761
Then your friend, the Archbishop,
will ponce up the stairs towards you,

1127
01:29:56,841 --> 01:30:02,141
and say, "Sir, is Your Majesty
willing to take the oath?"

1128
01:30:02,221 --> 01:30:05,721
- "I am willing."
- Well, of course you are.

1129
01:30:05,811 --> 01:30:07,981
I'm gonna see what this sounds like
in the cheap seats,

1130
01:30:08,061 --> 01:30:10,481
so even your old nanny can hear.

1131
01:30:10,561 --> 01:30:15,321
"Will you govern your peoples,
Great Britain, Ireland, Canada,

1132
01:30:15,401 --> 01:30:18,321
Australia and New Zealand,

1133
01:30:18,401 --> 01:30:22,371
according to their lands and customs?"

1134
01:30:22,452 --> 01:30:24,782
- "I SOLEMNLY PROMISE TO DO SO!"
- Louder.

1135
01:30:24,872 --> 01:30:28,662
- I can't hear you up the back.
- "I solemnly promise to do so."

1136
01:30:28,752 --> 01:30:31,832
Very good. "And will you, to your power,

1137
01:30:31,922 --> 01:30:37,012
cause Law and Justice, in Mercy to be
executed in all your judgments?"

1138
01:30:37,092 --> 01:30:38,972
"I will. "I WILL!"

1139
01:30:39,052 --> 01:30:42,092
Then there's a very long bit
about upholding the faith. It goes on,

1140
01:30:42,182 --> 01:30:44,932
rubbish, rubbish, rubbish,
to which you finally say...

1141
01:30:45,012 --> 01:30:50,942
"The things which I have...
here before promised,

1142
01:30:51,022 --> 01:30:54,812
I will perform and keep.
So help me God."

1143
01:30:55,402 --> 01:30:58,282
And that's all you say.
Four short responses.

1144
01:30:58,362 --> 01:31:01,782
Kiss the book, sign the oath,
and you're King.

1145
01:31:02,532 --> 01:31:03,532
Easy.

1146
01:31:16,882 --> 01:31:19,802
You nearly crowned him backwards,
Archbishop.

1147
01:31:21,302 --> 01:31:25,392
Someone had removed the thread
marking the back of the crown, sir.

1148
01:31:25,472 --> 01:31:27,722
Try not to lose the thread, Archbishop.

1149
01:31:28,643 --> 01:31:31,313
Archbishop, we're missing Papa.

1150
01:31:33,773 --> 01:31:37,113
- God save the King.
- Very good.

1151
01:31:37,653 --> 01:31:39,363
Very good, Archbishop.

1152
01:31:40,363 --> 01:31:43,863
Well, I hope Your Majesties
are thrilled with the result.

1153
01:31:43,953 --> 01:31:49,083
- You can switch that machine off.
- No, wait. Keep going.

1154
01:31:49,163 --> 01:31:51,543
- Nazism has held its great convention.
- Do take a seat, Archbishop.

1155
01:31:51,623 --> 01:31:53,833
Masses of uniformed men,
stupefying to the eye,

1156
01:31:53,923 --> 01:31:57,423
and incredible to the imagination
have stood in spellbound audience...

1157
01:31:57,503 --> 01:32:00,053
...of the Fuhrer.

1158
01:32:10,563 --> 01:32:14,103
- Papao Papa, what's he saying?
- Hmm?

1159
01:32:14,193 --> 01:32:18,363
I don't know, but he seems
to be saying it rather well.

1160
01:32:37,844 --> 01:32:42,674
Sir... I have asked to see you today

1161
01:32:42,764 --> 01:32:46,894
in order to tender my resignation
as Prime Minister.

1162
01:32:48,354 --> 01:32:51,684
I'm so sorry to hear that,
Mr. Baldwin.

1163
01:32:51,774 --> 01:32:55,444
Neville Chamberlain will
take my place as Prime Minister.

1164
01:32:55,524 --> 01:33:00,114
It's a matter of principle.
I was mistaken.

1165
01:33:00,194 --> 01:33:03,744
I have found it impossible to believe

1166
01:33:03,824 --> 01:33:07,164
that there is any man in the world

1167
01:33:07,244 --> 01:33:12,334
so lacking in moral feeling as Hitler,

1168
01:33:12,414 --> 01:33:16,964
that the world may be hurled
for a second time

1169
01:33:17,044 --> 01:33:20,344
into the abyss of destructive war.

1170
01:33:21,924 --> 01:33:24,764
Churchill was right all along.

1171
01:33:24,844 --> 01:33:27,384
This was always Hitler's intention.

1172
01:33:28,644 --> 01:33:33,264
I'm only very sorry to leave you
at this great time of crisis.

1173
01:33:35,894 --> 01:33:41,904
I'm very much afraid, sir,
that your greatest test is yet to come.

1174
01:33:47,155 --> 01:33:49,495
I am speaking to you...

1175
01:33:49,575 --> 01:33:54,705
...from the Cabinet room
at 10 Downing Street.

1176
01:33:54,795 --> 01:33:59,045
This morning,
the British ambassador in Berlin

1177
01:33:59,135 --> 01:34:03,135
handed the German government
a final note

1178
01:34:03,215 --> 01:34:08,885
stating that unless
we heard from them by 11:00,

1179
01:34:08,975 --> 01:34:14,105
that they were prepared at once
to withdraw their troops from Poland,

1180
01:34:14,185 --> 01:34:17,525
...a state of war would exist between us.

1181
01:34:19,315 --> 01:34:25,235
I have to tell you now that
no such undertaking has been received,

1182
01:34:25,325 --> 01:34:30,865
and that, consequently, this country
is at war with Germany.

1183
01:34:36,505 --> 01:34:38,965
At last, sir, here is your speech.

1184
01:34:39,835 --> 01:34:42,045
You are on air at six.

1185
01:34:42,135 --> 01:34:46,675
I have timed it
to just under nine minutes.

1186
01:34:46,766 --> 01:34:49,386
The wording is fully approved.

1187
01:34:49,476 --> 01:34:52,186
The Prime Minister
will be joining you for the broadcast,

1188
01:34:52,266 --> 01:34:54,976
which will go out live
across the nation, the Empire

1189
01:34:55,066 --> 01:34:58,396
- ...and to our armed forces.
- Get Logue here immediately.

1190
01:35:12,956 --> 01:35:15,706
- There's the barrage balloons.
- Yes.

1191
01:35:17,456 --> 01:35:20,126
- They got them up there quickly.
- Yeah.

1192
01:35:24,966 --> 01:35:28,386
- Hold it! Hold it!

1193
01:35:32,726 --> 01:35:35,436
- Shall we pull over and find a shelter?
- No, no. Go straight there.

1194
01:35:35,516 --> 01:35:36,936
We'll be all right.

1195
01:35:46,406 --> 01:35:48,536
- Yes, sir?
- Lionel Logue.

1196
01:35:48,617 --> 01:35:51,787
Major Hartley is expecting me.
This is my son, Laurie.

1197
01:35:59,417 --> 01:36:01,757
- Thank you, Laurie.
- Good luck, Dad.

1198
01:36:08,097 --> 01:36:09,597
- The King's speech.
- Thank you, sir.

1199
01:36:09,677 --> 01:36:12,517
We have about 40 minutes
to the broadcast.

1200
01:36:14,687 --> 01:36:17,937
Thank you very much. Thank you.

1201
01:36:18,017 --> 01:36:21,777
There may be dark days ahead...

1202
01:36:22,647 --> 01:36:25,567
...and...
- Try again.

1203
01:36:29,447 --> 01:36:33,747
There may be dark days ahead, and...

1204
01:36:35,117 --> 01:36:38,377
Turn the hesitations into pauses and say
to yourself, "God save the King."

1205
01:36:38,457 --> 01:36:42,127
I say that continuously,
but apparently no one's listening.

1206
01:36:42,207 --> 01:36:45,217
Long pauses are good.
They add solemnity to great occasions.

1207
01:36:45,297 --> 01:36:48,337
Then I'm the solemnest king
who ever lived.

1208
01:36:48,427 --> 01:36:52,967
You know, if I'm a king,
where's my power?

1209
01:36:53,057 --> 01:36:54,887
Can I... can I form a government?

1210
01:36:54,978 --> 01:36:58,348
Can I... can I... levy a tax?

1211
01:36:58,438 --> 01:37:00,898
Declare a... a war? No.

1212
01:37:00,978 --> 01:37:04,188
And yet I'm the seat of all authority.
Why? Because...

1213
01:37:04,778 --> 01:37:08,068
...the nation believes
that when I... I speak,

1214
01:37:08,158 --> 01:37:10,408
I speak for them. But I can't speak.

1215
01:37:12,118 --> 01:37:15,118
Let's take it all again from the top.
"In this grave hour."

1216
01:37:27,428 --> 01:37:31,388
In this grave hour...
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

1217
01:37:31,468 --> 01:37:34,768
Perhaps the most fateful
in our history... Bugger, shit, shit.

1218
01:37:34,848 --> 01:37:38,478
I send to every household of my...

1219
01:37:40,608 --> 01:37:43,438
You see, "P" is always difficult,
even when I'm singing.

1220
01:37:43,528 --> 01:37:45,438
Bounce on to it. "A peoples."

1221
01:37:45,528 --> 01:37:48,318
A people. A people.

1222
01:37:48,408 --> 01:37:53,028
Household of my peoples,
both at home

1223
01:37:53,118 --> 01:37:55,408
- ...and overseas.
- Beautiful.

1224
01:37:55,498 --> 01:37:58,328
This message... Doo-dah

1225
01:37:58,418 --> 01:38:01,328
Spoken with the same depth of feeling,
Doo-dah day,

1226
01:38:01,419 --> 01:38:04,299
...for each one of you,
as if I were able to...

1227
01:38:04,379 --> 01:38:08,929
Shit, fuck, bugger! ...cross your
threshold and speak to you...

1228
01:38:10,219 --> 01:38:12,299
In your head now. "I have a right
to be bloody well heard."

1229
01:38:12,389 --> 01:38:15,969
Bloody well heard,
bloody well heard myself!

1230
01:38:16,059 --> 01:38:19,139
Now, waltz. Move.
Get continuous movement.

1231
01:38:19,229 --> 01:38:23,519
"For the second time
in the lives of most of us...

1232
01:38:23,609 --> 01:38:27,069
- "We are at..."
- "We are," take a pause.

1233
01:38:27,149 --> 01:38:30,659
- Lionel, I can't do this.
- Bertie, you can do it.

1234
01:38:32,569 --> 01:38:35,949
- Have a look at the last paragraph.
- Bertie. It's time.

1235
01:38:38,459 --> 01:38:41,619
There he is.

1236
01:38:49,719 --> 01:38:52,389
- Archbishop.
- Your Majesty.

1237
01:38:53,219 --> 01:38:55,599
A great moment, Sir.

1238
01:38:59,389 --> 01:39:01,729
- Prime Minister.
- Your Majesty.

1239
01:39:03,609 --> 01:39:08,609
Nice to see you... again so soon.

1240
01:39:13,740 --> 01:39:15,990
Good of you to be here.
I'm sure you have had...

1241
01:39:18,330 --> 01:39:21,460
- ...a rather busy day.
- I hope we have no more interruptions...

1242
01:39:21,540 --> 01:39:25,710
- ...from those damn sirens, sir.
- Or the wretched dogs.

1243
01:39:27,090 --> 01:39:29,380
Congrat... Congratulations.

1244
01:39:29,470 --> 01:39:33,090
- First Lord of the Admiralty.
- Your Majesty.

1245
01:39:36,260 --> 01:39:40,060
The long... walk.

1246
01:39:42,230 --> 01:39:44,060
Good luck, sir.

1247
01:39:45,520 --> 01:39:48,780
I, too, dread this apparatus.

1248
01:39:49,650 --> 01:39:51,990
Had a speech impediment myself,
you know.

1249
01:39:52,950 --> 01:39:56,910
- I didn't.
- Family secret. Tongue-tied.

1250
01:39:56,990 --> 01:39:59,620
An operation was considered
to be too dangerous.

1251
01:39:59,700 --> 01:40:03,410
I eventually made an asset of it.

1252
01:40:06,340 --> 01:40:09,050
- Thank you, Mr. Churchill.
- Sir.

1253
01:40:09,130 --> 01:40:10,590
Darling.

1254
01:40:10,671 --> 01:40:13,841
- How long, Logue?
- Just under three minutes.

1255
01:40:44,501 --> 01:40:46,751
- Mr. Wood.
- Good luck, Your Majesty.

1256
01:40:50,051 --> 01:40:51,171
Mr. Wood.

1257
01:40:52,131 --> 01:40:55,631
- You've redecorated, Logue.
- I made it cosy.

1258
01:40:57,391 --> 01:41:00,641
- Some fresh air.
- There you are, darling.

1259
01:41:05,351 --> 01:41:06,981
I'm a thistle-sifter.

1260
01:41:07,061 --> 01:41:10,151
I've a sieve of sifted thistles
and a sieve of unsifted thistles.

1261
01:41:10,231 --> 01:41:13,861
A sieve of sifted thistles
and a sieve of unsifted thistles.

1262
01:41:13,941 --> 01:41:16,071
- Because I'm...
- Bertie. Darling.

1263
01:41:16,162 --> 01:41:18,282
Make sure it's not switched on.

1264
01:41:18,372 --> 01:41:20,242
Remember, the red light
will blink four times,

1265
01:41:20,332 --> 01:41:22,082
then I've asked them to turn it off.

1266
01:41:22,162 --> 01:41:25,202
'Cause we don't want that evil eye
staring at you all the way through.

1267
01:41:26,752 --> 01:41:28,582
One minute, sir.

1268
01:41:30,632 --> 01:41:32,752
I'm sure you'll be splendid.

1269
01:41:44,772 --> 01:41:46,352
Forty seconds, sir.

1270
01:41:49,272 --> 01:41:50,862
Logue.

1271
01:41:51,692 --> 01:41:53,942
However this turns out...

1272
01:41:55,442 --> 01:41:58,742
...I don't know how to thank you...
for what you've done.

1273
01:42:01,622 --> 01:42:03,202
Knighthood?

1274
01:42:07,662 --> 01:42:09,332
Twenty seconds.

1275
01:42:15,172 --> 01:42:19,382
Forget everything else,
and just say it to me.

1276
01:42:20,643 --> 01:42:23,433
Say it to me as a friend.

1277
01:43:04,893 --> 01:43:07,013
In this grave...

1278
01:43:08,433 --> 01:43:09,983
...hour...

1279
01:43:15,903 --> 01:43:21,863
...perhaps the most fateful
in our history...

1280
01:43:24,203 --> 01:43:26,583
...I send...

1281
01:43:26,664 --> 01:43:29,204
...to every household of my...

1282
01:43:32,004 --> 01:43:33,834
...a- peoples...

1283
01:43:36,424 --> 01:43:38,304
...both at home...

1284
01:43:42,474 --> 01:43:44,514
...and overseas...

1285
01:43:54,024 --> 01:43:56,064
...this message...

1286
01:43:57,074 --> 01:44:01,784
...spoken with the same
depth of feeling...

1287
01:44:02,574 --> 01:44:04,574
...for each one of you...

1288
01:44:05,074 --> 01:44:10,164
...as if I were able
to cross your threshold

1289
01:44:10,254 --> 01:44:14,464
and speak to you... myself.

1290
01:44:18,094 --> 01:44:22,884
For the second time
in the lives of most of us...

1291
01:44:22,974 --> 01:44:25,514
...we are... at...

1292
01:44:25,594 --> 01:44:26,934
Fuck, fuck, fuck!

1293
01:44:27,014 --> 01:44:28,264
...at war.

1294
01:44:29,224 --> 01:44:30,684
Very good.

1295
01:44:32,275 --> 01:44:36,525
Over and over again...

1296
01:44:37,615 --> 01:44:40,985
...we have tried to find...

1297
01:44:42,945 --> 01:44:48,785
...a peaceful way out
of the differences...

1298
01:44:49,835 --> 01:44:52,455
...between ourselves...

1299
01:44:52,545 --> 01:44:54,085
...and those...

1300
01:44:54,795 --> 01:45:00,135
...who are now our... enemies.

1301
01:45:02,135 --> 01:45:06,135
But it has been... in vain.

1302
01:45:06,975 --> 01:45:12,015
We have been forced into a conflict,

1303
01:45:12,105 --> 01:45:17,025
for we are called
to meet the challenge of a principle,

1304
01:45:17,105 --> 01:45:21,325
which, if it were to prevail,

1305
01:45:21,405 --> 01:45:25,955
would be fatal to any civilized order

1306
01:45:26,035 --> 01:45:28,075
in the world.

1307
01:45:28,995 --> 01:45:31,665
Such a principle,

1308
01:45:31,745 --> 01:45:37,675
stripped of all disguise,

1309
01:45:37,756 --> 01:45:40,886
is surely the mere...

1310
01:45:44,016 --> 01:45:47,976
...primitive doctrine that might...

1311
01:45:49,516 --> 01:45:51,106
...is right.

1312
01:45:52,066 --> 01:45:57,896
For the sake of all
that we ourselves hold dear,

1313
01:45:57,986 --> 01:46:01,566
it is unthinkable

1314
01:46:01,656 --> 01:46:06,326
that we should refuse to meet...

1315
01:46:06,406 --> 01:46:08,076
...the challenge.

1316
01:46:10,626 --> 01:46:15,376
It is to this high purpose

1317
01:46:15,456 --> 01:46:18,126
that I now call

1318
01:46:18,216 --> 01:46:22,176
my people at home,

1319
01:46:22,256 --> 01:46:26,766
and my peoples across the seas,

1320
01:46:26,846 --> 01:46:31,596
who will make our cause their own.

1321
01:46:31,686 --> 01:46:36,686
I ask them to stand calm

1322
01:46:36,776 --> 01:46:39,946
and firm and united

1323
01:46:40,026 --> 01:46:44,066
in this time of trial.

1324
01:46:44,157 --> 01:46:46,907
The task will be hard.

1325
01:46:47,867 --> 01:46:51,827
There may be dark days ahead,

1326
01:46:51,917 --> 01:46:57,757
and war can no longer be confined

1327
01:46:57,837 --> 01:47:00,127
to the battlefield.

1328
01:47:00,217 --> 01:47:03,217
But we can only do the right

1329
01:47:03,297 --> 01:47:05,887
as we see the right,

1330
01:47:05,967 --> 01:47:09,927
and reverently commit

1331
01:47:10,017 --> 01:47:14,477
Our cause to God.

1332
01:47:16,357 --> 01:47:20,027
If one and all we keep

1333
01:47:20,107 --> 01:47:25,027
resolutely faithful to it,

1334
01:47:25,117 --> 01:47:31,037
then, with God's help,

1335
01:47:31,117 --> 01:47:34,997
we shall... prevail.

1336
01:47:38,457 --> 01:47:42,467
[a sigh of relief]

1337
01:47:50,098 --> 01:47:51,728
It was very good, Bertie.

1338
01:48:06,578 --> 01:48:09,328
You still stammered on the "W."

1339
01:48:10,248 --> 01:48:14,158
Well, I had to throw in a few,
so they knew it was me.

1340
01:48:18,958 --> 01:48:22,048
Congratulations, Your Majesty.
A true broadcaster.

1341
01:48:22,128 --> 01:48:23,838
Thank you, Mr. Wood.

1342
01:48:26,888 --> 01:48:29,218
- Congratulations, Your Majesty.
- Sir.

1343
01:48:30,178 --> 01:48:33,178
- Congratulations, Your Majesty.
- Thank you.

1344
01:48:43,528 --> 01:48:44,898
Ready.

1345
01:48:45,908 --> 01:48:48,198
- Good?
- Perfect, sir.

1346
01:48:49,368 --> 01:48:52,658
Your first wartime speech.

1347
01:48:52,749 --> 01:48:54,619
Congratulations.

1348
01:48:54,709 --> 01:48:59,789
I expect I shall have to...
do a great deal more.

1349
01:49:03,129 --> 01:49:04,879
Thank you, Logue.

1350
01:49:14,269 --> 01:49:15,769
Well done.

1351
01:49:17,059 --> 01:49:18,729
My friend.

1352
01:49:20,399 --> 01:49:22,149
Thank you...

1353
01:49:22,979 --> 01:49:24,399
...Your Majesty.

1354
01:49:36,829 --> 01:49:38,619
I knew you'd be good.

1355
01:49:47,629 --> 01:49:51,009
Thank you... Lionel.

1356
01:49:54,059 --> 01:49:55,519
Onwards.

1357
01:49:56,309 --> 01:49:59,649
- Congratulations, sir.
- Well done, sir.

1358
01:49:59,730 --> 01:50:01,690
Couldn't have
said it better myself, sir.

1359
01:50:01,770 --> 01:50:04,780
Your Majesty, I am speechless.

1360
01:50:04,860 --> 01:50:08,240
- Congratulations, sir.
- Gentlemen.

1361
01:50:10,450 --> 01:50:14,950
- So how was Papa, Elizabeth?
- Halting at first,

1362
01:50:15,040 --> 01:50:19,790
- But you got much better, Papa.
- Well, bless you.

1363
01:50:20,670 --> 01:50:24,380
- And how about you, Margaret?
- You were just splendid, Papa.

1364
01:50:24,460 --> 01:50:26,880
Of course I was.

1365
01:50:27,970 --> 01:50:30,050
Are we all ready?

1366
01:50:30,140 --> 01:50:31,640
Come on, girls.

1
00:00:05,055 --> 00:00:12,728


2
00:00:18,055 --> 00:00:20,728
First day of law school,
my professor says two things.

3
00:00:20,935 --> 00:00:23,813
First, "From now on, when
your mother says she loves you,"

4
00:00:24,015 --> 00:00:26,654
- "get a second opinion."
- And?

5
00:00:26,855 --> 00:00:30,893
"You want justice, go to a whorehouse.
Wanna get fucked, go to court."

6
00:00:31,334 --> 00:00:32,608
Naomi!

7
00:00:32,814 --> 00:00:34,294
Let's say you have a client
you know is guilty.

8
00:00:34,495 --> 00:00:38,408
No. Neither our justice system
nor I care about that.

9
00:00:38,615 --> 00:00:41,083
Every defendant,
regardless of what he's done,

10
00:00:41,295 --> 00:00:43,525
has the right to the best defence
his attorney can provide.

11
00:00:43,735 --> 00:00:48,855
- Where were you with the truth?
- Truth? How do you mean?

12
00:00:49,455 --> 00:00:50,808
Naomi!

13
00:00:51,015 --> 00:00:53,768
I'm not sure how many ways
there are to mean it.

14
00:00:53,975 --> 00:00:56,773
- You think there's only one?
- You're late.

15
00:00:58,295 --> 00:01:01,890
- There's only one that matters.
- Marty, hold still.

16
00:01:02,095 --> 00:01:06,647
My version of it. The one I create
in the minds of the twelve jurors.

17
00:01:06,856 --> 00:01:11,054
If you want, you can call it
something else. The illusion of truth.

18
00:01:11,616 --> 00:01:13,846
- If you want. It's up to you.
- OK.

19
00:01:16,815 --> 00:01:19,648
Jack, you need more?
Tomorrow afternoon?

20
00:01:19,855 --> 00:01:23,052
- Yeah.
- I'll have my secretary set it up.

21
00:01:23,255 --> 00:01:24,574
OK.

22
00:01:29,255 --> 00:01:31,086
- This is a cover story, right?
- Yeah.

23
00:01:31,295 --> 00:01:31,886
Yeah. OK, bye.

24
00:03:32,297 --> 00:03:36,735
St. Michael's Boys Choir, thank you.
A very talented group.

25
00:03:37,457 --> 00:03:40,210
Right now, we're gonna have
a brief photo session

26
00:03:40,417 --> 00:03:42,692
while we have the boys here
with His Excellency.

27
00:03:42,897 --> 00:03:48,130
I'll be back in a few minutes. Bear with
us, enjoy your dessert and thank you.

28
00:04:00,897 --> 00:04:02,967
Mangia, mangia.

29
00:04:11,858 --> 00:04:14,770
Thanks. Marty!
What an unexpected surprise.

30
00:04:14,978 --> 00:04:17,333
I'm here to help our friendly prosecutor
off the hook.

31
00:04:17,538 --> 00:04:20,336
- Excuse me.
- What's it gonna cost?

32
00:04:20,538 --> 00:04:23,336
A lot less than the alternative.

33
00:04:23,538 --> 00:04:26,609
Tomorrow. My office. 9:30.

34
00:04:27,857 --> 00:04:31,213
- Is this on? Yes, it is.
- Nice to see you again.

35
00:04:31,417 --> 00:04:36,014
We have come to the heart of
the matter. Why we're here tonight.

36
00:04:36,218 --> 00:04:38,857
It's the fifth straight year
it's been my privilege

37
00:04:39,058 --> 00:04:43,256
to serve as master of ceremony
for the Chicago Bar Association...

38
00:04:43,458 --> 00:04:47,929
- I'm afraid you'll have to put that out.
- It's a bar for Christ's sake.

39
00:04:54,818 --> 00:04:56,854
I thought you quit.

40
00:04:57,058 --> 00:04:59,094
I cut down.

41
00:05:00,338 --> 00:05:03,489
You look beautiful. Cut your hair?

42
00:05:03,698 --> 00:05:05,496
Yeah, a few months ago.

43
00:05:07,659 --> 00:05:10,093
Wanna dance?

44
00:05:10,299 --> 00:05:14,007
- There isn't any music.
- I'm sure there is.

45
00:05:25,778 --> 00:05:27,450
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen...

46
00:05:29,218 --> 00:05:30,856
All you have to do is turn around.

47
00:05:31,058 --> 00:05:32,935
I thought you liked it better like this.

48
00:05:33,138 --> 00:05:35,653
That way you don't have
to look at the person.

49
00:05:35,859 --> 00:05:37,338
Mean.

50
00:05:39,179 --> 00:05:40,931
Look at me.

51
00:05:44,659 --> 00:05:48,049
Come on. Let's go find a bar
you can still smoke in.

52
00:05:48,259 --> 00:05:51,854
Thanks for the invite, but I don't like
one-night stands all that much.

53
00:05:53,219 --> 00:05:55,528
We saw each other for months.

54
00:05:55,739 --> 00:06:00,971
It was a one-night stand, Marty.
It just lasted six months.

55
00:06:12,139 --> 00:06:17,088
Well, I must say I haven't seen
this many lawyers and politicians

56
00:06:17,299 --> 00:06:21,292
gathered together in one place
since confession this morning.

57
00:06:31,859 --> 00:06:35,057
There is no way the People
will tolerate a monetary award

58
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:38,058
to a cockroach
who deserves twenty-to-life.

59
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:42,048
He may be your client, but Joey Pinero
was a hard-case felon.

60
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:46,411
- Dealing, racketeering, money...
- Did you say "alleged", Yancy?

61
00:06:46,619 --> 00:06:48,735
Did you hear him say "alleged"?

62
00:06:48,939 --> 00:06:51,134
Mr Pinero has never
been convicted of anything.

63
00:06:51,339 --> 00:06:54,809
The cops left him bleeding in the snow.
A miracle he survived.

64
00:06:55,019 --> 00:06:59,171
Having said that,
I'm not opposed to a settlement.

65
00:07:00,139 --> 00:07:03,211
1 ,500,000 and Pinero leaves the state.

66
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:10,568
You can't limit a citizen's right
to live where he wants to.

67
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:12,099
Legally, that's unenforceable.

68
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:15,133
Enforceable or just
a gentleman's agreement,

69
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:17,251
Mr Pinero will know what we want.

70
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:24,176
Get the answer you're looking for,
don't sit around and chat. A pleasure.

71
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:26,850
You're worse
than the thugs you represent.

72
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:29,779
- That's enough, Bud. It's over.
- I have to run this by him.

73
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:34,257
You're on a 40% commission. I'm sure
your recommendation will prevail.

74
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:36,893
Thank you, John.

75
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:35,015
Oh, Jesus.

76
00:09:36,502 --> 00:09:38,572
- Hey, Mr Vail.
- How are you doing?

77
00:09:48,742 --> 00:09:50,016
Buena.

78
00:09:52,582 --> 00:09:54,094
Nice tune.

79
00:09:55,461 --> 00:09:58,612
- Traeme dos tequilas por aqui.
- Bien, m'hijito.

80
00:10:00,461 --> 00:10:02,577
So, what did they say?

81
00:10:02,781 --> 00:10:07,902
A take-it-or-leave-it offer of 1 ,500,000.
From Shaughnessy himself.

82
00:10:09,262 --> 00:10:11,378
What do you think?

83
00:10:13,462 --> 00:10:17,660
We should take it. Unless you wanna
spend two years in appellate court.

84
00:10:17,862 --> 00:10:21,298
- No, fuck that. Close it.
- Done.

85
00:10:23,742 --> 00:10:25,858
- OK.
- Gracias.

86
00:10:26,062 --> 00:10:28,337
- Salud.
- Salud.

87
00:10:31,822 --> 00:10:33,813
- Mia?
- Your shot.

88
00:10:35,143 --> 00:10:38,021
There's one more little thing.

89
00:10:39,223 --> 00:10:41,417
They want you to leave the state.

90
00:10:42,502 --> 00:10:47,292
- They want you to disappear.
- Disappear?

91
00:10:47,502 --> 00:10:49,493
That's good. Same bullshit, right?

92
00:10:50,302 --> 00:10:52,896
What? What are you talking about?

93
00:10:54,782 --> 00:10:57,660
I keep getting these offers
from these guys, Marty.

94
00:10:57,862 --> 00:10:59,295
What offers?

95
00:10:59,502 --> 00:11:04,018
A couple of months ago
a cop walks in here. He says,

96
00:11:04,222 --> 00:11:08,774
"You testify against Alderman
Martinez, and we'll owe you, Joey."

97
00:11:08,983 --> 00:11:12,771
Say he did you favours,
say he's on your payroll.

98
00:11:12,983 --> 00:11:16,453
So I tell him to go fuck himself.
Martinez is a good man.

99
00:11:16,663 --> 00:11:17,982
He's the one holding out

100
00:11:18,183 --> 00:11:21,220
while the others try to turn South River
into high-rent condos.

101
00:11:21,663 --> 00:11:24,894
- Why didn't you tell me this before?
- Why?

102
00:11:25,103 --> 00:11:26,855
'Cause this shit happens every day.

103
00:11:27,063 --> 00:11:29,053
I didn't think
it had anything to do with this.

104
00:11:29,262 --> 00:11:31,617
- You don't.
- I've spent a lot of money here.

105
00:11:31,822 --> 00:11:33,778
- They spent more.
- I built a clinic here.

106
00:11:33,982 --> 00:11:35,382
These people depend on me.

107
00:11:35,583 --> 00:11:38,541
I don't give a shit.
Send them cheques from California.

108
00:11:43,183 --> 00:11:46,493
Chucho, hazme el favor,
scame el CD.

109
00:11:47,823 --> 00:11:51,418
I respect your advice, Marty,
but I can't take it.

110
00:11:51,623 --> 00:11:56,253
- I'll take the money, but I ain't going.
- I don't like it, Joey.

111
00:11:56,463 --> 00:12:00,217
Chucho, dame.
So, what are they gonna do? Kill me?

112
00:12:00,423 --> 00:12:02,618
They've tried once.

113
00:12:02,823 --> 00:12:05,702
How are they gonna kill
a man who never sleeps?

114
00:12:05,904 --> 00:12:08,418
- Get the money.
- You're too much.

115
00:12:09,904 --> 00:12:12,737
That song you liked, fourth cut.

116
00:12:13,784 --> 00:12:15,421
Very nice, thank you.

117
00:12:36,264 --> 00:12:37,822
Police'll have their hands full...

118
00:12:38,024 --> 00:12:41,699
- Captain, can you tell us anything?
- I don't know anything.

119
00:12:41,904 --> 00:12:43,940
Captain Stenner, what's going on?

120
00:12:44,144 --> 00:12:48,137
I haven't seen anything yet. As soon
as I've been inside, I'll tell you.

121
00:13:07,384 --> 00:13:10,262
You should be home in bed, Abel.
It's going around.

122
00:13:10,464 --> 00:13:12,500
I'll consider that, Harvey.

123
00:13:16,304 --> 00:13:19,535
Christ. What a mess, huh?.

124
00:13:37,745 --> 00:13:41,135
- Sam, you got all you need?
- Roll him over.

125
00:13:52,424 --> 00:13:54,380
Hey, stop!

126
00:13:55,144 --> 00:13:57,260
Four fingers severed.

127
00:13:57,464 --> 00:14:03,699
A symbol, B 32.1 56,
is carved into the chest.

128
00:14:10,025 --> 00:14:12,414
Body temperature is still warm...

129
00:14:12,625 --> 00:14:15,185
Captain, we've got
a live one on the run.

130
00:14:36,306 --> 00:14:38,660
A passing train has separated
the suspect...

131
00:14:38,865 --> 00:14:40,935
You want to know what I hate?

132
00:14:41,145 --> 00:14:45,821
When they go on and on about what
big whores defence attorneys are.

133
00:14:46,025 --> 00:14:48,300
We're the bad guys? You know why?

134
00:14:48,505 --> 00:14:51,303
We sit next to some creep,
we start to look creepy.

135
00:14:51,505 --> 00:14:55,020
They assume they're guilty,
like we know it or something.

136
00:14:55,225 --> 00:14:59,696
You don't know, you don't ask,
you don't care. You do the damn job.

137
00:14:59,905 --> 00:15:02,783
It's not like they're your friends
for Christ's sake.

138
00:15:03,985 --> 00:15:06,500
Well, some are your friends, but...

139
00:15:16,306 --> 00:15:18,695
Why did you leave
the State Attorney's office?

140
00:15:18,906 --> 00:15:20,544
Dead-end job.

141
00:15:22,306 --> 00:15:27,095
You can either run for office
or end up a judge.

142
00:15:27,305 --> 00:15:29,819
Why become an umpire
when you can play ball?

143
00:15:30,025 --> 00:15:33,574
...around St. Michael's
and the Archbishop's mansion...

144
00:15:51,026 --> 00:15:53,540
Over here! He's over here!

145
00:15:58,586 --> 00:16:02,864
We will of course stay with this story
as it continues to unfold.

146
00:16:03,066 --> 00:16:07,299
What we do know is that
approx. 1 1:08 this morning...

147
00:16:07,507 --> 00:16:10,305
So when did you know you had them?

148
00:16:12,866 --> 00:16:14,265
What? Sorry?

149
00:16:14,466 --> 00:16:19,176
When during the Pinero trial did you
say to yourself, "I've got them"?

150
00:16:19,386 --> 00:16:21,297
The day I took the case. Excuse me.

151
00:16:21,506 --> 00:16:25,340
The shocking murder of one
of Chicago's most beloved figures,

152
00:16:25,546 --> 00:16:29,061
Archbishop Richard Rushman,
has left the cityjust numb.

153
00:16:29,266 --> 00:16:31,143
I understand we have Andy live.

154
00:16:31,346 --> 00:16:35,259
We havejust learned the police
have arrested a 19-year-old man

155
00:16:35,466 --> 00:16:39,062
identified as Aaron Stampler.
According to Captain Stenner...

156
00:16:39,267 --> 00:16:43,101
We have to reschedule.
Call my office, OK? I'm sorry.

157
00:16:50,387 --> 00:16:53,857
- Law offices of Martin Vail.
- You got the news on by any chance?

158
00:16:54,067 --> 00:16:56,501
Call Sullivan in Judge Trutter's office.

159
00:16:56,707 --> 00:16:58,981
Find out where he is,
and call me at the Alibi.

160
00:16:59,186 --> 00:17:00,824
- A lot ofguys'll want this one.
- OK.

161
00:17:02,946 --> 00:17:06,222
The police have taken the first steps,
acting with speed, with the arrest.

162
00:17:26,427 --> 00:17:30,739
- Are you taking the Stampler case?
- I'm sorry, I can't talk right now.

163
00:17:36,668 --> 00:17:39,262
- State Attorney left yet?
- Yeah, Yancy no less.

164
00:17:39,468 --> 00:17:40,981
- PD?
- Come and gone.

165
00:17:41,188 --> 00:17:42,860
Lock up!

166
00:17:43,068 --> 00:17:46,298
- Give my best to your brother.
- Yeah, sure.

167
00:17:47,787 --> 00:17:49,743
I'd like to see him alone if I could.

168
00:17:49,947 --> 00:17:52,984
- All right, but I'll have to lock you in.
- Understood.

169
00:18:19,908 --> 00:18:22,024
You know who I am?

170
00:18:23,828 --> 00:18:26,501
No, no, sir. No, I don't.

171
00:18:26,708 --> 00:18:31,179
My name is Martin Vail.
I'm what you call a big-shot attorney.

172
00:18:31,868 --> 00:18:36,258
-I don't... I don't have no money.
- I didn't think you did.

173
00:18:36,467 --> 00:18:38,902
I'm willing to take
your case pro bono,

174
00:18:39,108 --> 00:18:42,783
which means you get all of
my expertise and hard work for free.

175
00:18:44,188 --> 00:18:48,704
Or you can get the 40,000-a-year
court-appointed public defender,

176
00:18:48,908 --> 00:18:52,787
who will almost certainly
escort you to death row. Your choice.

177
00:18:52,988 --> 00:18:58,585
No, sir. I'd surely be grateful
for anything you can do.

178
00:18:58,788 --> 00:19:00,665
You're welcome.

179
00:19:00,868 --> 00:19:04,065
Now, your full name is...?

180
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:07,261
My... Aaron Luke Sta...

181
00:19:08,229 --> 00:19:10,697
Stampler.

182
00:19:11,509 --> 00:19:13,067
Stampler.

183
00:19:13,269 --> 00:19:17,660
- You from Kentucky, Aaron?
- Yes, sir. I'm from Creekside.

184
00:19:17,869 --> 00:19:21,417
- Does it say that there?
- No.

185
00:19:22,868 --> 00:19:25,826
How long have you been
here in Chicago?

186
00:19:28,428 --> 00:19:30,259
Two years next month, I think.

187
00:19:30,788 --> 00:19:34,019
- Have you been arrested?
- No, sir.

188
00:19:37,469 --> 00:19:40,063
How do you know the Archbishop?

189
00:19:43,109 --> 00:19:47,500
I was begging on the street,
up on the Wacker Drive.

190
00:19:49,589 --> 00:19:53,502
Bishop Rushman came by
in his Cadillac.

191
00:19:53,709 --> 00:19:57,019
He saw me and he stopped.

192
00:19:58,269 --> 00:20:00,146
He took me into Savior House.

193
00:20:00,869 --> 00:20:02,746
I work as an altar boy.

194
00:20:02,949 --> 00:20:05,258
And I sing in his choir.

195
00:20:05,469 --> 00:20:08,302
How long were you there, Aaron,
Savior House?

196
00:20:08,509 --> 00:20:10,101
A year. Year and a half.

197
00:20:10,309 --> 00:20:14,268
You're supposed to leave
when you're 1 8, but...

198
00:20:14,469 --> 00:20:19,543
But Bishop Rushman let me stay on
way past my 1 9th birthday.

199
00:20:20,989 --> 00:20:22,707
That was nice of him.

200
00:20:25,709 --> 00:20:28,018
Yes. Yes, it was.

201
00:20:30,269 --> 00:20:33,466
Aaron, did you have any reason
to dislike the Archbishop?

202
00:20:33,669 --> 00:20:36,741
Dislike? No, no, sir.

203
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:39,987
He was like a father to me.

204
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:42,101
Yeah, but you...

205
00:20:43,670 --> 00:20:46,423
How am I gonna say this?

206
00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:49,622
Were you in the room
when he was murdered?

207
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:55,101
How can you explain that?

208
00:20:55,309 --> 00:20:58,301
There was someone else
in that room, Mr Vail.

209
00:21:00,469 --> 00:21:02,187
- There was a third person?
- Yes, sir.

210
00:21:02,389 --> 00:21:04,778
- Did you tell the police this?
- Yes, I did.

211
00:21:04,989 --> 00:21:08,380
- But they didn't believe me.
- All right. You tell me now.

212
00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:12,458
I was returning a book

213
00:21:12,670 --> 00:21:15,138
to Bishop Rushman's library.

214
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:20,902
I heard a noise,
so I went back into his bedroom.

215
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:26,023
Bishop Rushman
was lying on the floor.

216
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:30,425
There was blood all over everýthing.

217
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:35,146
Then I saw the shadow.
I saw a person

218
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:38,149
Ieaning over Bishop Rushman.

219
00:21:39,191 --> 00:21:43,468
He looked up, and he came at me.
And that's when I lost time.

220
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:47,988
What does that mean? Lost time?

221
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:51,387
I bla... I blacked out.

222
00:21:52,230 --> 00:21:54,744
It happens to me sometimes.

223
00:21:56,390 --> 00:21:58,779
I have...

224
00:21:58,990 --> 00:22:01,948
..spells. I have spells.

225
00:22:02,150 --> 00:22:04,345
I lose time.

226
00:22:05,030 --> 00:22:08,148
I can't remember nothing.

227
00:22:11,951 --> 00:22:16,502
Why did you run from the police,
Aaron, if you didn't do anything wrong?

228
00:22:16,711 --> 00:22:22,263
Well, when I woke up,
I was covered in blood.

229
00:22:22,471 --> 00:22:24,382
I didn't know what to do.

230
00:22:24,591 --> 00:22:27,822
I got scared,
I heard sirens, so I ran.

231
00:22:28,030 --> 00:22:31,067
Look, I know how it looks, Mr Vail,
but I swear...

232
00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:34,819
I don't need you to convince me.
Just answer my questions.

233
00:22:35,030 --> 00:22:39,422
- I didn't do this. You got to believe me.
- No, I don't. I don't care.

234
00:22:39,631 --> 00:22:43,909
I am your attorney, which means
I'm your mother, your father,

235
00:22:44,111 --> 00:22:46,705
your best friend and your priest.

236
00:22:47,871 --> 00:22:50,305
I don't want you talking
to anyone but me.

237
00:22:50,511 --> 00:22:53,867
Not the cops, the press,
the guys in the cells, nobody,

238
00:22:54,071 --> 00:22:56,062
without my permission.
You understand?

239
00:22:56,271 --> 00:22:59,388
- Yeah?
- Yes. Yes, I do.

240
00:22:59,591 --> 00:23:03,630
All right. Now the important stuff.
What's your suit size?

241
00:23:05,791 --> 00:23:09,148
- My what?
- Suit size. What are you? A 38"?

242
00:23:13,672 --> 00:23:17,584
- I don't know.
- Well, a 38" Iong.

243
00:23:20,431 --> 00:23:23,901
The police flushed Stampler from
his hiding place behind the Cathedral.

244
00:23:24,111 --> 00:23:27,421
They chased him through
the train yard, almost losing him

245
00:23:27,631 --> 00:23:32,102
as he scrambled over tracks before
an oncoming train separated them.

246
00:23:32,311 --> 00:23:35,508
Prominent local criminal
defence attorney Martin Vail

247
00:23:35,711 --> 00:23:38,385
is believed to have visited Stampler
at the Maxwell Street ...

248
00:23:38,592 --> 00:23:42,107
After a brief chase across the rail yard
behind St. Michael's Cathedral,

249
00:23:42,312 --> 00:23:45,543
Stampler was apprehended
in a hole beneath train tracks...

250
00:23:45,752 --> 00:23:49,711
- Are you defending this man?
- I'm sorry...

251
00:23:49,912 --> 00:23:52,472
Thank you very much. Thank you.

252
00:23:53,272 --> 00:23:55,342
We've taken the first step
in the process.

253
00:23:55,552 --> 00:23:57,588
I can now take your questions.

254
00:23:57,792 --> 00:24:01,785
Shaughnessy, what about the
altar boy group Stampler was part of?

255
00:24:01,992 --> 00:24:03,265
Not much at this time.

256
00:24:03,471 --> 00:24:05,621
Could other altar boys be involved?

257
00:24:05,831 --> 00:24:08,505
We have no reason to suspect
anyone other than Stampler.

258
00:24:08,712 --> 00:24:12,421
He had access to the Archbishop's
quarters. He was caught as he fled.

259
00:24:12,632 --> 00:24:15,669
The blood-soaked Aaron Stampler
was chased under McCormick Place,

260
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:19,467
but not before he was almost killed
by a passing train.

261
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:24,667
He's gonna call you
as soon as he gets here. Thank you.

262
00:24:24,872 --> 00:24:27,147
- Naomi!
- Yeah.

263
00:24:27,352 --> 00:24:29,070
Sorry, I'm late.
We have a new client.

264
00:24:29,272 --> 00:24:32,025
- I was afraid you were gonna say that.
- Who?

265
00:24:32,232 --> 00:24:35,747
You know what they're calling him?
The Butcher Boy of St. Mike's.

266
00:24:35,952 --> 00:24:38,308
- I like that.
- You'll be hearing it a lot.

267
00:24:38,513 --> 00:24:40,822
Is the kid who chopped up
the Archbishop our client?

268
00:24:41,033 --> 00:24:45,549
You have to get "allegedly" into your
vocabulary if you want to be a lawyer.

269
00:24:45,753 --> 00:24:47,584
- Coffee, Tommy?
- No, thanks.

270
00:24:47,793 --> 00:24:52,229
He admits he was in the room when
the killing occurred, but he didn't see it.

271
00:24:52,432 --> 00:24:55,788
- Can I stop you right there?
- No. He was returning a book.

272
00:24:55,992 --> 00:24:58,665
He heard loud noises in the bedroom.

273
00:24:58,872 --> 00:25:03,548
He went in. He sees a figure in
the shadows, kneeling over the body.

274
00:25:04,112 --> 00:25:06,228
He blacks out. Next thing he knows,

275
00:25:06,432 --> 00:25:08,663
sirens are screaming,
he's covered in blood.

276
00:25:08,873 --> 00:25:12,707
The cops find him in a train tunnel.
He's got the Archbishop's ring on him.

277
00:25:12,913 --> 00:25:16,064
- He stole the Archbishop's ring?
- No, it was in his pocket.

278
00:25:20,353 --> 00:25:22,344
Is that it?

279
00:25:24,593 --> 00:25:26,231
Yep.

280
00:25:27,673 --> 00:25:28,992
That's...

281
00:25:30,113 --> 00:25:33,867
That's the worst bullshit story
I've heard in my entire life.

282
00:25:34,073 --> 00:25:36,382
Now it's our bullshit story.

283
00:25:36,592 --> 00:25:39,107
OK. Let's get to work.

284
00:25:39,313 --> 00:25:43,670
The name of the game is "motive".
The Prosecution doesn't have one.

285
00:25:43,873 --> 00:25:47,309
We have to prove that someone
else could have committed the crime,

286
00:25:47,513 --> 00:25:49,231
then we can establish
reasonable doubt.

287
00:25:49,433 --> 00:25:52,027
I want to know everýthing I can
about this guy.

288
00:25:52,233 --> 00:25:55,782
Go to Database,
go to Hall of Records, IRS files.

289
00:25:56,353 --> 00:25:59,743
- Even so-called charities.
- So-called? He was a priest.

290
00:26:01,673 --> 00:26:08,273
Naomi, write this down. B 32.1 56. It
was carved into the Archbishop's chest.

291
00:26:08,474 --> 00:26:10,704
- Allegedly.
- No, that was a fact.

292
00:26:10,914 --> 00:26:13,508
- But I appreciate the effort.
- Thanks.

293
00:26:14,114 --> 00:26:18,630
I also need case histories on murder
by stabbing, mutilation and religion.

294
00:26:18,834 --> 00:26:21,746
- Also I'm gonna need a psychiatrist.
- You're telling me.

295
00:26:21,954 --> 00:26:25,468
Not the kind who lives
in a witness box. I need a real one.

296
00:26:25,673 --> 00:26:29,507
- And an expert on amnesia.
- What does he look like in person?

297
00:26:29,713 --> 00:26:31,465
The Butcher Boy?

298
00:26:33,433 --> 00:26:36,186
- Like a boy scout.
- A boy scout...

299
00:26:37,233 --> 00:26:39,748
..with a merit badge in carving.

300
00:26:40,314 --> 00:26:43,226
The Archbishop was
a close friend of Mr Shaughnessy.

301
00:26:43,434 --> 00:26:45,994
He asked me who my best man was.

302
00:26:46,194 --> 00:26:48,469
- I said you.
- Thank you.

303
00:26:49,594 --> 00:26:51,710
I trust if I'm to prosecute this case,

304
00:26:51,914 --> 00:26:54,906
I'll get the authority
which comes with it.

305
00:26:55,114 --> 00:26:57,264
You're the one trying the case.

306
00:26:57,474 --> 00:27:00,705
But let's establish one thing
at the outset. I want the death penalty.

307
00:27:02,674 --> 00:27:07,031
I'd like to go over the case before we
determine whether or not to seek that.

308
00:27:07,234 --> 00:27:11,944
I'm open to anything you have to say,
but in my mind there's no debate.

309
00:27:13,074 --> 00:27:15,713
Did the boy they picked up
say anything?

310
00:27:15,914 --> 00:27:18,382
Yeah, he didn't do it.

311
00:27:18,594 --> 00:27:21,904
- It's a slam dunk, Janet.
- Excuse me.

312
00:27:22,114 --> 00:27:25,151
I appreciate your faith in me.
I don't mean to be argumentative.

313
00:27:25,354 --> 00:27:29,108
- It's what we pay you for.
- Open and shut, you don't need me.

314
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:33,227
The PD'll plead no contest and throw
the kid on the mercy of the court.

315
00:27:33,914 --> 00:27:36,064
There's not a public defender.

316
00:27:36,274 --> 00:27:40,348
He's got a lawyer? Already? Who?

317
00:27:44,115 --> 00:27:46,071
Hey, I'm Martin Vail.

318
00:27:46,275 --> 00:27:50,632
I'm defending Aaron Stampler.
I need to inspect the murder site.

319
00:27:50,835 --> 00:27:52,985
Oh, the Butcher Boy, huh?

320
00:27:53,195 --> 00:27:56,346
Thank you, yes. I forgot his real name.

321
00:28:01,674 --> 00:28:04,472
What's the matter, Marty?
Lost your faith?

322
00:28:05,394 --> 00:28:06,747
Looking for a little religion?

323
00:28:06,954 --> 00:28:10,868
Tell me, counsellor. Which one of us
is the true headline chaser here?

324
00:28:11,075 --> 00:28:14,909
- Unlike you, I was assigned.
- Yeah? And you're up to it?

325
00:28:15,115 --> 00:28:19,074
Sold the book rights, or will you wait?
Wanna see some pictures?

326
00:28:22,475 --> 00:28:24,193
They're kind of cute.

327
00:28:29,075 --> 00:28:33,466
I think you'll agree they clearly show
the heinous nature of the crime.

328
00:28:36,875 --> 00:28:40,949
Small piece of advice. Don't use
the word "heinous" in the courtroom.

329
00:28:41,156 --> 00:28:43,067
Half the jury won't know
what you mean.

330
00:28:43,276 --> 00:28:46,950
Small piece of advice. I'm not
sitting second chair to you any more.

331
00:28:47,155 --> 00:28:50,465
In case you hadn't noticed,
I graduated.

332
00:28:53,515 --> 00:28:56,951
- I had no reason to leave.
- You had every reason to leave.

333
00:28:57,155 --> 00:29:01,592
- How can you still work for them?
- You expect me to trot out after you?

334
00:29:01,795 --> 00:29:04,025
Quit just because you did?

335
00:29:04,235 --> 00:29:09,230
I don't need a Mercedes. I don't need
to see my face on the evening news.

336
00:29:14,676 --> 00:29:17,509
You knew I was coming here,
didn't you?

337
00:29:17,716 --> 00:29:21,152
You knew I would defend him.
That's why you took the case.

338
00:29:21,356 --> 00:29:26,794
Oh, please. What's the matter, Marty?
Are you nervous?

339
00:29:28,396 --> 00:29:32,308
Been a while since you rubbed up
against a woman with a brain?

340
00:29:34,475 --> 00:29:37,387
What's the matter? You tired,
you haven't been sleeping well?

341
00:29:37,595 --> 00:29:41,066
You're the one with the score to settle.
I sleep great at night.

342
00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:39,953
Cook County Dept. of Corrections
Div. IX Maximum Security Dormitory

343
00:30:46,277 --> 00:30:47,551
Thanks.

344
00:30:49,077 --> 00:30:53,275
- Hey. Where is he?
- Over here.

345
00:31:11,117 --> 00:31:13,995
We'll be sitting at a table
with two of my associates.

346
00:31:14,197 --> 00:31:17,348
Once the charges are read,
the judge'll ask how you plead.

347
00:31:17,557 --> 00:31:19,912
- Not guilty.
- No.

348
00:31:20,117 --> 00:31:21,755
But I'm not guilty, Mr Vail.

349
00:31:21,957 --> 00:31:25,029
It doesn't matter.
Keep your mouth shut.

350
00:31:25,237 --> 00:31:28,912
- Are you gonna say I'm not guilty?
- I'll say whatever I say. Don't worry.

351
00:31:29,117 --> 00:31:30,675
- But...
- This is what I mean.

352
00:31:30,877 --> 00:31:36,474
This can't go on in the courtroom. Get
used to it. I speak, you do not speak.

353
00:31:36,677 --> 00:31:40,148
- Your job is to sit and look innocent.
- I am innocent.

354
00:31:41,318 --> 00:31:44,515
That's it! That's how I want you to look.

355
00:31:44,718 --> 00:31:47,107
Can you remember that?
Look in the mirror if you have to.

356
00:31:47,318 --> 00:31:50,276
I don't have to.
This is how I always look.

357
00:31:50,478 --> 00:31:54,026
Then you're way ahead
of the game already, aren't you?

358
00:31:54,237 --> 00:31:55,716
Don't smile.

359
00:31:58,077 --> 00:31:59,795
Don't.

360
00:32:07,837 --> 00:32:12,787
- Mr Vail, can we have a statement?
- We're gonna find out what happened.

361
00:32:12,998 --> 00:32:14,989
The only pressure is to find the truth.

362
00:32:15,998 --> 00:32:19,593
You've talked to the police. I told you
not to. They get everýthing wrong.

363
00:32:19,798 --> 00:32:22,870
How will you explain
his blood-soaked clothes?

364
00:32:23,078 --> 00:32:26,593
I won't explain anything now.
I've just been retained in this case.

365
00:32:26,798 --> 00:32:30,268
Significant facts are in dispute here
and continue to be so.

366
00:32:30,478 --> 00:32:34,187
You're a master at putting the victim
on trial to help your client.

367
00:32:34,398 --> 00:32:36,354
That'll be very difficult in this case.

368
00:32:36,558 --> 00:32:38,947
The victim in this case is my client.

369
00:32:39,158 --> 00:32:42,036
We have two victims here,
no suspects. Thank you.

370
00:32:42,238 --> 00:32:44,627
- You worried about his safety?
- No. Thank you.

371
00:32:59,598 --> 00:33:02,271
I don't think there's any question
about the verdict.

372
00:33:08,558 --> 00:33:10,834
All rise.

373
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:12,597
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.

374
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:15,433
Bailiff.

375
00:33:15,639 --> 00:33:17,834
The State versus Aaron Stampler.

376
00:33:18,479 --> 00:33:22,438
- Is every... Sit down. Everyone here?
- Yes, Your Honour.

377
00:33:22,639 --> 00:33:24,277
Madame Prosecutor.

378
00:33:24,479 --> 00:33:28,835
The State charges Aaron Stampler
with murder in the first degree.

379
00:33:29,038 --> 00:33:30,551
How does your client plead?

380
00:33:30,758 --> 00:33:33,067
If it pleases the Court,
I need time to make

381
00:33:33,278 --> 00:33:36,111
a psychiatric evaluation before
charges are brought against us.

382
00:33:36,318 --> 00:33:38,468
The State has enough evidence
to warrant the allegations.

383
00:33:38,678 --> 00:33:42,069
I agree. Motion denied.
Mr Stampler.

384
00:33:43,439 --> 00:33:46,590
- Do you understand the charges?
- Yes.

385
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:51,554
I direct my client not to answer that.
His response might incriminate him.

386
00:33:51,759 --> 00:33:54,557
He is taking the Fifth on whether
or not he understands the charges?

387
00:33:54,759 --> 00:33:57,717
Yes. Until we have a complete
psychological evaluation,

388
00:33:57,919 --> 00:34:01,628
he will be taking the Fifth on any
and all questions posed to him.

389
00:34:01,839 --> 00:34:04,399
The State versus Appleby.

390
00:34:04,599 --> 00:34:06,510
For your review on precedent.
Thank you.

391
00:34:23,439 --> 00:34:26,351
No, I can't do that. No.

392
00:34:29,039 --> 00:34:30,597
What do you want?

393
00:34:30,799 --> 00:34:34,428
I'm looking for the room a kid named
Aaron Stampler stayed in.

394
00:34:36,279 --> 00:34:39,237
- Are you the police?
- I'm his uncle.

395
00:35:42,921 --> 00:35:44,957
Well, hey.

396
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:55,519
- This is Alex's.
- Who's Alex?

397
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:58,075
He's one of the other altar boys.

398
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:01,113
An altar boy.
An altar boy was wearing this?

399
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:05,434
Well, not at mass.

400
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:10,674
This altar boy attacked a colleague
of mine and hurt him pretty bad.

401
00:36:14,681 --> 00:36:18,117
What do you think he was doing
in your room?

402
00:36:20,761 --> 00:36:26,040
I can't... I don't know.
I don't have nothing.

403
00:36:26,241 --> 00:36:30,678
- You know where to find him?
- Who? Alex?

404
00:36:30,881 --> 00:36:34,510
- No, I don't know where he is.
- You don't?

405
00:36:35,121 --> 00:36:37,680
- Who's Linda?
- L-Linda?

406
00:36:48,441 --> 00:36:51,433
Is she your girlfriend?

407
00:36:51,641 --> 00:36:53,916
Where is she? I'd like to talk to her.

408
00:36:54,121 --> 00:36:56,032
I don't know where she is.

409
00:36:56,241 --> 00:36:58,675
I get this feeling
you're not telling me something.

410
00:36:58,881 --> 00:37:01,156
- I'm telling you the truth.
- I don't think so.

411
00:37:01,721 --> 00:37:05,680
Are you surprised
that Alex attacked my friend?

412
00:37:05,881 --> 00:37:08,714
No. No, he has a temper.

413
00:37:08,921 --> 00:37:11,152
Yeah, I'd say so.

414
00:37:12,402 --> 00:37:15,280
Do you think it could be Alex

415
00:37:15,482 --> 00:37:19,475
who was that figure you saw
at the Archbishop's room?

416
00:37:19,682 --> 00:37:22,958
I... Alex? I couldn't be sure.

417
00:37:23,162 --> 00:37:25,880
- But it could be him.
- I don't know.

418
00:37:26,081 --> 00:37:28,436
You don't understand.
The State wants you dead.

419
00:37:28,641 --> 00:37:30,677
You don't help me,
that's what they'll get.

420
00:37:34,801 --> 00:37:37,793
I'm trying. I can't remember.

421
00:37:38,001 --> 00:37:41,199
I don't understand. Why would Alex
wanna do such a thing?

422
00:37:41,402 --> 00:37:44,314
For his own reasons.
Maybe someone hired him.

423
00:37:46,202 --> 00:37:49,274
- Hired by who?
- Forget it.

424
00:37:51,962 --> 00:37:54,556
Do you think he's capable of doing it?

425
00:37:55,082 --> 00:37:57,312
I don't know.

426
00:37:58,682 --> 00:38:01,242
I don't know who's capable
of such a thing.

427
00:38:07,642 --> 00:38:09,200
- Oh, thanks.
- Sure.

428
00:38:10,562 --> 00:38:14,601
He claims there was someone else
in the room, and he can't remember.

429
00:38:16,082 --> 00:38:20,758
You want me to look into this amnesia
question and see what he knows?

430
00:38:20,962 --> 00:38:23,556
What if he knows he did it?

431
00:38:23,762 --> 00:38:25,559
Major causes of amnesia are:

432
00:38:25,762 --> 00:38:30,313
substance abuse, seizures,
head injuries and malingering.

433
00:38:32,562 --> 00:38:35,156
I think the kid is telling the truth.

434
00:38:36,802 --> 00:38:40,716
OK. Then let's get something straight.

435
00:38:40,923 --> 00:38:45,553
I'm happy to go in and analyse him,
in fact I'm looking forward to it,

436
00:38:45,763 --> 00:38:48,880
but I won't go in there
to validate a story. Understood?

437
00:38:49,083 --> 00:38:52,473
You do your job,
I do mine, yatta, yatta.

438
00:38:52,683 --> 00:38:54,435
If I think it's necessary,

439
00:38:54,643 --> 00:38:57,839
I'd wanna get an MRl, EEG
and Neuropsych testing.

440
00:38:58,042 --> 00:39:01,557
- Yes, doctor. Good night.
- Good night.

441
00:39:06,762 --> 00:39:08,878
I'll be recording our meetings
for Mr Vail.

442
00:39:09,082 --> 00:39:14,715
So it isn't as confidential as it would be
if you were consulting with the doctor.

443
00:39:14,923 --> 00:39:18,279
He may even call me as a witness.
If you have any questions...

444
00:39:18,483 --> 00:39:22,920
- ...you should raise them to him now.
- No, ma'am. I understand.

445
00:39:23,123 --> 00:39:27,833
Good. So, OK. I think we'll be fine.

446
00:39:28,043 --> 00:39:30,079
- I'll see you later.
- OK.

447
00:39:30,963 --> 00:39:32,237
Bye.

448
00:39:39,563 --> 00:39:44,240
Vail told me there's time surrounding
the death you don't remember.

449
00:39:44,444 --> 00:39:46,320
- Is that right?
- Yes.

450
00:39:46,523 --> 00:39:49,959
I lost the time.

451
00:39:50,163 --> 00:39:52,836
I mean I blacked out.

452
00:39:53,843 --> 00:39:57,313
- Have you had blackouts before?
- Yes, I have.

453
00:39:57,523 --> 00:40:01,118
When's the first time
you remember them happening?

454
00:40:03,243 --> 00:40:07,156
They started when I was about twelve.

455
00:40:07,363 --> 00:40:09,593
Were your parents aware
of what was happening to you?

456
00:40:09,803 --> 00:40:14,559
N-no. My m-m-mother was dead.

457
00:40:15,884 --> 00:40:17,920
And your father?

458
00:40:20,044 --> 00:40:24,640
No, no. He was not a nice man.

459
00:40:24,844 --> 00:40:27,642
- Did you seek treatment?
- Did I what?

460
00:40:28,844 --> 00:40:31,722
- Did you see a doctor for them?
- Oh.

461
00:40:33,443 --> 00:40:35,195
No.

462
00:40:35,403 --> 00:40:39,555
You don't go to a doctor in Creekside
unless your leg's broken.

463
00:40:47,644 --> 00:40:51,114
- Hey. Can I talk to you?
- Talk.

464
00:40:51,324 --> 00:40:53,997
Excuse us. I'll bring her right back.

465
00:40:54,524 --> 00:40:56,116
How dare you?

466
00:40:56,324 --> 00:40:59,236
Am I a chess piece you can
move around? I was having lunch.

467
00:40:59,444 --> 00:41:02,595
When are we getting all the discovery?

468
00:41:02,804 --> 00:41:05,113
- What do you want?
- I want to know when.

469
00:41:05,324 --> 00:41:07,474
- I've got motions to file.
- No, you don't.

470
00:41:07,684 --> 00:41:10,323
You're looking to make a deal.

471
00:41:11,725 --> 00:41:15,718
I have no authority to deal from
my client. What's your excuse?

472
00:41:15,925 --> 00:41:19,155
If we needed to make a deal,
I have all the authority I want.

473
00:41:19,364 --> 00:41:24,154
Bullshit! Shaughnessy wants the
whole shot. He's using you to get it.

474
00:41:24,364 --> 00:41:27,037
Deal this down
to murder with no death penalty.

475
00:41:27,244 --> 00:41:30,077
Deal down?
We have a fucking great case.

476
00:41:31,404 --> 00:41:36,762
Great case? Lack of prior record, no
eye witness, no confession, no motive.

477
00:41:36,964 --> 00:41:42,722
Hard evidence. I assume you're not
going with insanity, which is a shame.

478
00:41:42,925 --> 00:41:45,485
My shrinks would have torn him apart.

479
00:41:46,765 --> 00:41:49,404
Your pleading the Fifth
on the charges was brilliant.

480
00:41:49,605 --> 00:41:52,597
It was good, wasn't it? I liked it.

481
00:41:53,845 --> 00:41:57,884
You lose this case, you take the fall,
not Shaughnessy.

482
00:41:59,245 --> 00:42:02,601
- Talk to me.
- We're going to trial, Marty.

483
00:42:04,685 --> 00:42:08,996
All right. All it takes is one.
One juror who doesn't believe he did it.

484
00:42:09,204 --> 00:42:12,038
One juror with a kid
who looks into that face...

485
00:42:12,245 --> 00:42:14,713
That face is great. You prepping him
to take the stand?

486
00:42:14,925 --> 00:42:17,564
That stutter is p-p-priceless.

487
00:42:20,525 --> 00:42:22,356
Oh, Marty.

488
00:42:22,565 --> 00:42:25,284
Don't tell me you think he didn't do it.

489
00:42:25,485 --> 00:42:28,397
Has little Aaron Stampler
gotten to you?

490
00:42:28,605 --> 00:42:32,803
We're not just talking about jail here,
but ending someone's life.

491
00:42:33,005 --> 00:42:36,156
If you're wrong and Shaughnessy's
made you do this, can you live with it?

492
00:42:36,365 --> 00:42:38,435
I'll live.

493
00:42:40,485 --> 00:42:42,442
See you in court.

494
00:42:45,046 --> 00:42:47,435
We stipulate
that murder was done here.

495
00:42:47,646 --> 00:42:49,955
So these photos
have no probative value.

496
00:42:50,166 --> 00:42:52,919
This is not just murder,
it's mutilation and torture.

497
00:42:53,125 --> 00:42:56,322
The Prosecution wants to show them
to the jury for shock appeal.

498
00:42:56,525 --> 00:43:00,438
Not true. They clearly identify
the heinous nature of the crime,

499
00:43:00,645 --> 00:43:04,399
and they connect the defendant, found
covered in blood, to the crime scene.

500
00:43:04,605 --> 00:43:06,561
- Prejudicial.
- I beg to differ.

501
00:43:06,765 --> 00:43:09,837
Counsel, please!
The photos are in, Mr Vail.

502
00:43:10,045 --> 00:43:12,924
Would you like a recess
to carry on with this in private?

503
00:43:13,126 --> 00:43:14,957
I'm sorry, Your Honour,
but this is too much.

504
00:43:15,166 --> 00:43:17,919
Next thing, he'll be objecting
if we bring in the murder weapon.

505
00:43:21,126 --> 00:43:24,243
Now that she brings it up...

506
00:43:28,086 --> 00:43:30,441
This is a public building.

507
00:43:36,126 --> 00:43:38,321
Excuse me, Mr Vail.

508
00:43:39,686 --> 00:43:42,564
Would you sign this for me?

509
00:43:44,846 --> 00:43:47,485
Tell me about Linda.
Mr Vail said she was your girlfriend.

510
00:43:49,286 --> 00:43:50,799
Yes, she was.

511
00:43:51,006 --> 00:43:53,236
How did you meet?

512
00:43:53,446 --> 00:43:56,563
Well, we were both
at the Savior House.

513
00:43:56,766 --> 00:44:01,442
I was an altar boy. She was doing
work for Bishop Rushman.

514
00:44:02,686 --> 00:44:07,123
- What was the relationship like?
- Me and Linda?

515
00:44:07,326 --> 00:44:10,921
She is real cultural,
real cultural and very smart.

516
00:44:11,126 --> 00:44:13,004
We had a nice time together.

517
00:44:16,847 --> 00:44:18,360
We might get married.

518
00:44:20,807 --> 00:44:23,037
Were you sleeping together?

519
00:44:26,727 --> 00:44:30,036
- Well, that's private.
- I know. I have to ask the question.

520
00:44:30,886 --> 00:44:33,559
Were you having
a sexual relationship, Aaron?

521
00:44:36,126 --> 00:44:38,321
Yes, we were.

522
00:44:38,526 --> 00:44:40,756
Were you sleeping with anyone else
at the time?

523
00:44:42,007 --> 00:44:43,838
No.

524
00:44:44,047 --> 00:44:46,163
Was she?

525
00:44:53,807 --> 00:44:56,480
Has she been to see you, Aaron?

526
00:45:03,567 --> 00:45:07,162
- Well, no, but...
- And that upsets you.

527
00:45:10,087 --> 00:45:13,876
No. No, the thing is she went away.

528
00:45:14,887 --> 00:45:17,321
She went away for a while.

529
00:45:17,527 --> 00:45:21,645
She left before this happened.
I don't even think...

530
00:45:21,847 --> 00:45:23,803
I don't even think she knows about it.

531
00:45:36,807 --> 00:45:38,798
- Yo, boss.
- Hey. Got something for me?

532
00:45:39,007 --> 00:45:40,725
Yeah.

533
00:45:40,927 --> 00:45:44,762
There's nothing catalogued downtown
under the numbers B 321 56.

534
00:45:44,968 --> 00:45:51,157
But I don't think the B is a B. It's an 8.
I think the knife slipped. 8321 56.

535
00:45:52,088 --> 00:45:54,556
Thomas Jefferson.
I don't think he did it.

536
00:45:54,768 --> 00:46:00,161
This won't help. Rushman's charities
and his foundation's investments.

537
00:46:00,368 --> 00:46:02,642
Nothing startling,
except how many there are.

538
00:46:05,847 --> 00:46:07,678
Wait a minute here.

539
00:46:07,887 --> 00:46:10,924
What was he doing
with the South River deal? Pull that up.

540
00:46:12,488 --> 00:46:13,921
LOADING FILE

541
00:46:14,688 --> 00:46:16,440
Yeah. The investors.

542
00:46:18,928 --> 00:46:21,203
Shaughnessy?

543
00:46:21,408 --> 00:46:23,717
That's Joey Pinero's neighbourhood.

544
00:46:24,208 --> 00:46:27,325
See this lot here?
This all used to be houses.

545
00:46:27,528 --> 00:46:33,444
In fact, there was a house in the corner
where I kissed my first girlfriend.

546
00:46:33,648 --> 00:46:35,445
Got her pregnant, too.

547
00:46:35,648 --> 00:46:37,878
- Hell of a kiss, Joey.
- Oh, yeah.

548
00:46:38,088 --> 00:46:42,446
The neighbourhood will end up
high-rent condos if they get their way.

549
00:46:42,649 --> 00:46:45,322
That's why I'll buy back the lot
with the settlement you got me.

550
00:46:46,009 --> 00:46:48,000
You heard about the money, right?

551
00:46:48,209 --> 00:46:50,119
- Who hasn't?
- Marty's the best, man.

552
00:46:50,328 --> 00:46:52,284
Just doing my job.

553
00:46:52,488 --> 00:46:54,604
1 ,500,000. He's just doing his job.

554
00:46:54,808 --> 00:46:59,404
Alderman, Joey tells me a cop came
around, wanting him to set you up.

555
00:47:01,568 --> 00:47:03,524
It's typical.

556
00:47:03,728 --> 00:47:06,800
Can't buy me,
so they try to buy a brother.

557
00:47:07,008 --> 00:47:10,762
Most people assume this land we're
walking on belongs to the railroad.

558
00:47:10,968 --> 00:47:14,405
But it doesn't. It belongs to the Church.

559
00:47:14,609 --> 00:47:16,122
The Church?

560
00:47:18,329 --> 00:47:20,638
- So that's the Rushman Foundation.
- That's right.

561
00:47:20,849 --> 00:47:26,287
- With a bunch of rich developers.
- Including John Shaughnessy.

562
00:47:26,489 --> 00:47:32,086
They bought up land and buildings
around the Church property

563
00:47:32,289 --> 00:47:36,042
and tore them down.
Our neighbourhood would disappear.

564
00:47:36,248 --> 00:47:40,241
I went to the Archbishop and said,
"What are you doing to these people?"

565
00:47:40,448 --> 00:47:44,442
"They're poor. They're getting
kicked out of their homes."

566
00:47:44,649 --> 00:47:47,163
- "And they're Catholic."
- Fucking A.

567
00:47:47,369 --> 00:47:51,157
He listened. I couldn't believe it.

568
00:47:51,369 --> 00:47:53,599
He told them to stop developing
around the Church property.

569
00:47:53,809 --> 00:47:58,837
The partners hold buildings they can't
demolish and land they can't build on.

570
00:47:59,049 --> 00:48:01,847
Shaughnessy loses millions.

571
00:48:02,049 --> 00:48:04,722
- If I need you to, will you testify?
- Who? Me?

572
00:48:04,929 --> 00:48:07,238
Oh, yeah. Easy.

573
00:48:07,449 --> 00:48:10,486
Just change out of this suit, put on
a Brooks Brothers with loafers and...

574
00:48:10,689 --> 00:48:13,250
No, Joey. Not you.

575
00:48:15,210 --> 00:48:17,360
Sure.

576
00:48:17,570 --> 00:48:19,526
I'll testify.

577
00:48:22,010 --> 00:48:25,604
You know what people think?
That this great city runs itself.

578
00:48:25,809 --> 00:48:30,280
They think it gets up, goes to work and
climbs into bed at night, like we do.

579
00:48:30,489 --> 00:48:33,526
Unaware of what it takes to make sure
it doesn't break down.

580
00:48:33,729 --> 00:48:37,119
Crime, fires, riots.

581
00:48:37,329 --> 00:48:41,959
The water pipes bursting under
the city. What a mess that was.

582
00:48:42,169 --> 00:48:45,082
And the Water Commissioner
calls the contractor who built it?

583
00:48:45,290 --> 00:48:48,487
No, he calls me. They all call me.

584
00:48:51,410 --> 00:48:53,366
Goddamn, this is terrific.

585
00:48:54,290 --> 00:48:59,284
They call me because I keep
the peace. That's my job.

586
00:49:00,890 --> 00:49:03,643
This city doesn't burn
because I won't permit it.

587
00:49:03,850 --> 00:49:05,647
I'm the great negotiator.

588
00:49:05,850 --> 00:49:09,047
You think people get that?
The truth is I don't care.

589
00:49:09,250 --> 00:49:11,604
The dumb bastards don't even vote.

590
00:49:11,809 --> 00:49:15,166
They just eat, sleep, watch TV
and occasionally fuck their wives.

591
00:49:16,690 --> 00:49:19,329
Guess we should all thank you.

592
00:49:19,530 --> 00:49:21,122
You're welcome.

593
00:49:22,290 --> 00:49:24,645
John, you need some new material.

594
00:49:24,850 --> 00:49:28,889
I've heard this great-city speech
ten times already.

595
00:49:30,970 --> 00:49:33,404
Your boy Pinero is not honouring
his side of the deal.

596
00:49:34,690 --> 00:49:38,478
- Is that what this dinner is about?
- In part.

597
00:49:38,690 --> 00:49:43,082
I told him what the deal is.
He's a grown up. What else?

598
00:49:44,651 --> 00:49:48,087
Your assistant's been digging around
in the Archbishop's finances.

599
00:49:49,731 --> 00:49:51,847
Yeah, well.

600
00:49:58,090 --> 00:50:03,289
How much did you lose when he
pulled the plug from South River?

601
00:50:03,490 --> 00:50:05,685
Let me tell you something.

602
00:50:05,890 --> 00:50:09,485
It's a mistake to stick your thumb in
the eyes of the city's most powerful.

603
00:50:09,690 --> 00:50:12,763
It's not their eyes I'm aiming for.

604
00:50:15,731 --> 00:50:17,687
Do not fuck with me, Marty.

605
00:50:31,571 --> 00:50:34,244
The pipes are bursting again, John.

606
00:50:50,371 --> 00:50:53,602
In the most anticipated murder trial
in recent Chicago history,

607
00:50:53,811 --> 00:50:57,690
former State Attorney Prosecutor
Martin Vail will lead...

608
00:51:03,971 --> 00:51:06,439
Richard Rushman was a man of God.

609
00:51:06,651 --> 00:51:10,087
He spent his life giving
to the people of Chicago.

610
00:51:10,291 --> 00:51:14,171
He was a beacon ofinspiration,
not only as a spiritual leader...

611
00:51:14,372 --> 00:51:17,205
...deliver his opening statement
tomorrow...

612
00:51:17,412 --> 00:51:21,883
My name is Martin Vail. The reason
I'm here, and the reason you're here,

613
00:51:22,092 --> 00:51:25,209
is to make sure
the whole truth is known.

614
00:51:25,412 --> 00:51:27,004
We can learn the truth

615
00:51:27,212 --> 00:51:29,931
by talking about what the Prosecution
does not want you to hear.

616
00:51:30,132 --> 00:51:34,329
Do not be fooled by the defendant's
innocent appearance and demeanour.

617
00:51:34,531 --> 00:51:38,444
Aaron Stampler sat injudgment
ofArchbishop Rushman

618
00:51:38,651 --> 00:51:41,211
and determined
that not only should he die,

619
00:51:41,411 --> 00:51:43,562
but he should die the most brutal...

620
00:51:43,772 --> 00:51:47,924
We all saw Aaron being arrested
minutes after the Archbishop's death.

621
00:51:48,132 --> 00:51:53,809
But why? Because he was convenient
and the police were under pressure...

622
00:51:54,012 --> 00:51:58,563
The evidence will show that Aaron
Stampler stalked, ambushed

623
00:51:58,772 --> 00:52:00,842
and savagely murdered
this great man.

624
00:52:01,052 --> 00:52:02,849
The Prosecution doesn't want you
to hear about

625
00:52:03,052 --> 00:52:06,408
the other altar boys who have
mysteriously disappeared.

626
00:52:06,612 --> 00:52:08,842
At the close of evidence,
you will learn

627
00:52:09,052 --> 00:52:11,043
that Aaron Stampler
had everything he needed

628
00:52:11,252 --> 00:52:13,813
for the perfect assassination.
Using this knife...

629
00:52:15,293 --> 00:52:20,320
..Aaron Stampler repeatedly stabbed
at the Archbishop's chest,

630
00:52:20,532 --> 00:52:22,966
his genitals and his eyes.

631
00:52:23,172 --> 00:52:25,367
They don't want you to hear
that the Archbishop

632
00:52:25,572 --> 00:52:28,086
invested on behalf
of the Roman Catholic Church.

633
00:52:28,292 --> 00:52:32,808
Investments resulting in huge losses
for some very powerful people.

634
00:52:33,492 --> 00:52:39,010
They don't want you to hear about the
20 death threats he received this year.

635
00:52:39,212 --> 00:52:43,525
And they really don't want you
to hear about their theory of motive.

636
00:52:43,733 --> 00:52:45,246
Why is that? Very simple.

637
00:52:47,893 --> 00:52:49,804
They don't have one.

638
00:52:52,613 --> 00:52:57,129
Inspector Woodside, explain to the
court where the sneakers came from.

639
00:52:57,333 --> 00:53:00,484
They were taken off the defendant
when he was apprehended.

640
00:53:00,693 --> 00:53:03,571
What was the result
of the blood-stain analysis?

641
00:53:03,773 --> 00:53:06,161
They proved to be human blood

642
00:53:06,372 --> 00:53:09,808
matching the blood type and DNA
characteristics of the Archbishop.

643
00:53:10,012 --> 00:53:12,606
What did the bloody footprints
surrounding the body tell you?

644
00:53:12,812 --> 00:53:17,364
The killer left a pattern of footprints
around the area of the struggle,

645
00:53:17,573 --> 00:53:20,451
as indicated by the spread of blood
through the room.

646
00:53:20,653 --> 00:53:25,249
Yes or no, inspector. Could there have
been a third person in the quarters?

647
00:53:25,453 --> 00:53:28,843
- There's no evidence to suggest that.
- No evidence proves there wasn't.

648
00:53:29,053 --> 00:53:30,486
No.

649
00:53:30,693 --> 00:53:32,445
What happened after the struggle?

650
00:53:32,653 --> 00:53:36,089
Our analysis suggests
the killer was startled and ran

651
00:53:36,293 --> 00:53:38,011
from the bedroom and down the stairs.

652
00:53:38,213 --> 00:53:43,925
Is it possible, inspector...
that the real killer, the third person,

653
00:53:44,134 --> 00:53:48,446
who maybe was smart enough not
to tramp a whole freeway of blood

654
00:53:48,654 --> 00:53:50,246
through the whole place,

655
00:53:50,454 --> 00:53:54,002
couldn't this third person have placed
the defendant's prints on the knife...

656
00:53:54,213 --> 00:53:57,603
- ...while he was passed out?
- Anything is possible.

657
00:53:57,813 --> 00:54:01,123
Clearly the victim suffered
a great number of stab wounds.

658
00:54:01,333 --> 00:54:02,925
Yes, he did. 78.

659
00:54:03,133 --> 00:54:07,285
He tried to defend himself, that
explains cuts on hands and forearms.

660
00:54:07,493 --> 00:54:10,166
Doctor, isn't it a fact
that you can't be sure

661
00:54:10,373 --> 00:54:15,732
whether more than one person inflicted
these 78 stab and incised wounds?

662
00:54:15,934 --> 00:54:18,687
It could have been more than one,
but I doubt it.

663
00:54:18,894 --> 00:54:21,408
From your analysis
of the knife wounds,

664
00:54:21,614 --> 00:54:24,686
do you have an opinion whether
the killer was left or right-handed?

665
00:54:24,894 --> 00:54:27,362
The wounds to the throat
and most of the chest wounds

666
00:54:27,574 --> 00:54:31,772
were made from an angle that strongly
suggests a left-handed person.

667
00:54:31,974 --> 00:54:35,011
- Is the defendant left-handed?
- Yes, he is.

668
00:54:35,214 --> 00:54:40,924
It's possible a right-handed person
could have used his left hand.

669
00:54:41,133 --> 00:54:42,532
Yes, I suppose that's possible.

670
00:54:42,733 --> 00:54:48,047
Then it's reasonable to assume there
was a third person at the crime scene.

671
00:54:48,254 --> 00:54:51,166
Reasonable, no. But it is possible.

672
00:54:51,374 --> 00:54:54,764
...then following opening statements
it was a day ofstrong testimony

673
00:54:54,974 --> 00:54:56,805
from the Prosecution's first witnesses,

674
00:54:57,014 --> 00:55:01,485
Forensics ChiefHarvey Woodside
and Medical Examiner Emile Weil.

675
00:55:01,694 --> 00:55:04,572
It was also tough cross-examination
of Woodside and Weil

676
00:55:04,774 --> 00:55:07,163
by Stampler defence attorney
Martin Vail.

677
00:55:09,294 --> 00:55:12,366
Captain Stenner, thank you
for the time you've given us.

678
00:55:12,534 --> 00:55:17,928
But finally, I'd like to turn your attention
to the symbol carved into the chest.

679
00:55:18,135 --> 00:55:21,332
Would you please tell the jury
about that, captain?

680
00:55:21,535 --> 00:55:24,333
Yes, the letter and the numbers

681
00:55:24,535 --> 00:55:28,447
B 32.1 56 were carved
into the Archbishop's chest.

682
00:55:28,654 --> 00:55:32,647
Have you been able to find
an identical reference anywhere?

683
00:55:32,854 --> 00:55:34,333
I believe so, yes.

684
00:55:34,534 --> 00:55:40,166
The symbol B 32.1 56 is actually
catalogue code for a book

685
00:55:40,374 --> 00:55:44,163
discovered in a private reading room
located in the church basement.

686
00:55:44,375 --> 00:55:49,733
That particular number, the B 32 part,
refers to a book, The Scarlet Letter,

687
00:55:49,935 --> 00:55:51,687
by Nathaniel Hawthorne.

688
00:55:51,895 --> 00:55:55,365
When we opened the book
to page 1 56,

689
00:55:55,575 --> 00:55:58,089
we discovered an underlined passage.

690
00:55:59,415 --> 00:56:03,533
Could you please read
this underlined passage to the court?

691
00:56:05,575 --> 00:56:08,294
"No man, for any considerable period,"

692
00:56:08,495 --> 00:56:11,805
"can wear one face to himself
and another to the multitude"

693
00:56:12,015 --> 00:56:16,964
"without finally getting bewildered
as to which may be the true."

694
00:56:17,175 --> 00:56:19,450
Thank you.

695
00:56:22,535 --> 00:56:24,287
What does that passage mean to you?

696
00:56:24,495 --> 00:56:27,009
Objection. He's a policeman,
not an English professor.

697
00:56:27,215 --> 00:56:29,854
His interpretation will be
speculative and irrelevant.

698
00:56:30,055 --> 00:56:33,445
She didn't ask for an expert opinion.
Witness can answer.

699
00:56:34,895 --> 00:56:36,726
Well, to me it's simple.

700
00:56:36,935 --> 00:56:41,213
The killer thought his victim was
two-faced, dishonest in some way.

701
00:56:41,415 --> 00:56:43,007
In your experience, captain,

702
00:56:43,215 --> 00:56:46,572
do killers ever intentionally
leave clues to their motive?

703
00:56:46,776 --> 00:56:49,973
Not often, but it happens.

704
00:56:55,136 --> 00:56:56,694
Thanks.

705
00:56:56,896 --> 00:56:58,375
- Thanks, man.
- Yeah, sure.

706
00:56:59,456 --> 00:57:01,730
Did you underline that book?

707
00:57:01,935 --> 00:57:04,324
- What?
- Did you underline that book?

708
00:57:04,535 --> 00:57:06,810
- No, Mr Vail.
- No?

709
00:57:07,015 --> 00:57:10,974
No, Mr Vail. I never even opened
The Scarlet Letter.

710
00:57:11,175 --> 00:57:13,928
I don't like Hawthorne.

711
00:57:14,136 --> 00:57:16,809
We had that one about the house with
the seven somethings in high school,

712
00:57:17,016 --> 00:57:20,088
I couldn't even get past page 1 0.

713
00:57:21,216 --> 00:57:25,255
I wasn't the only one
using Bishop Rushman's library.

714
00:57:25,456 --> 00:57:27,606
Everybody borrowed books
from Bishop Rushman.

715
00:57:27,816 --> 00:57:31,013
He encouraged it. Altar boys, staff,
everyone was in there.

716
00:57:31,216 --> 00:57:32,934
Guard.

717
00:57:42,536 --> 00:57:44,846
You don't give up, do you?

718
00:57:48,896 --> 00:57:52,605
- You didn't know anything about that?
- No.

719
00:57:52,816 --> 00:57:55,455
- What about the impact...?
- I can't talk right now.

720
00:57:55,656 --> 00:57:58,011
My office will call you, right? OK, bye.

721
00:57:58,216 --> 00:57:59,569
- Thanks.
- See you.

722
00:58:01,936 --> 00:58:03,415
Bye.

723
00:58:09,296 --> 00:58:11,651
What the fuck happened in there?

724
00:58:11,856 --> 00:58:14,530
I guess that 8 was a B after all.

725
00:58:16,057 --> 00:58:20,335
You think this is funny?
We're losing this case.

726
00:58:20,537 --> 00:58:22,255
What happened?
How could you've missed that?

727
00:58:22,457 --> 00:58:25,130
There are 50 of them,
plus the entire Chicago PD.

728
00:58:25,337 --> 00:58:27,726
How was I to know he had
a reading room in the basement?

729
00:58:27,937 --> 00:58:29,290
- It's your job.
- You want my job?!

730
00:58:29,497 --> 00:58:32,295
- No, I want you to do your job!
- Marty, come on.

731
00:58:33,857 --> 00:58:36,654
I'm working on a third-man defence.
Figured that out yet?

732
00:58:36,856 --> 00:58:41,646
I don't have a third man. Why?
Because you can't fucking find him!

733
00:58:41,856 --> 00:58:46,533
- Is it that hard to find one indigent kid?
- Maybe we already got the kid.

734
00:58:46,737 --> 00:58:50,093
We have to at least consider
the possibility that he did it.

735
00:58:50,297 --> 00:58:53,095
The evidence points towards him,
and you refuse to look at it.

736
00:58:53,297 --> 00:58:56,528
I'm not refusing to look at anything!
I don't think he did it!

737
00:58:57,577 --> 00:59:00,569
We're up there in a couple of days,
and we got dick!

738
00:59:00,777 --> 00:59:03,450
- Do your fucking jobs!
- Fuck!

739
00:59:17,658 --> 00:59:21,333
It must have been hard to come
to Chicago. You didn't know anybody.

740
00:59:22,897 --> 00:59:24,171
Nobody.

741
00:59:25,377 --> 00:59:27,368
Did you have any money?

742
00:59:27,577 --> 00:59:30,250
No, nothing.

743
00:59:31,457 --> 00:59:35,814
I wanna talk more about
your girlfriend, Linda. Can we, Aaron?

744
00:59:37,577 --> 00:59:39,488
- No.
- Why not?

745
00:59:43,937 --> 00:59:45,496
Aaron.

746
00:59:50,498 --> 00:59:53,012
Oh, I'm sorry.

747
00:59:55,138 --> 00:59:58,096
D-d-do you think
we can do this later?

748
00:59:58,298 --> 01:00:03,691
- No, I wanna stay with this a while.
- I'm just a li-li-little tired.

749
01:00:03,898 --> 01:00:07,129
I know. Why does talking about
Linda Forbes upset you?

750
01:00:07,338 --> 01:00:10,693
It d-d... It doesn't.

751
01:00:12,097 --> 01:00:15,056
I just don't want
to talk about it right now.

752
01:00:15,258 --> 01:00:20,537
- Why not? Are you all right?
- No, my head hurts.

753
01:00:22,018 --> 01:00:23,929
OK, I'm sorry. Let me just fix this.

754
01:00:29,378 --> 01:00:32,973
- You know what I can do with this?
- No, how the fuck should I know?

755
01:00:36,538 --> 01:00:38,369
Jesus Christ.

756
01:00:46,939 --> 01:00:48,531
Aaron?

757
01:00:57,338 --> 01:01:00,887
What? What were you saying?

758
01:03:47,341 --> 01:03:50,174
What do you want? I'll kill you!

759
01:03:50,381 --> 01:03:52,656
I don't think so, Alex. Drop it.

760
01:03:53,301 --> 01:03:54,780
Drop it.

761
01:03:59,101 --> 01:04:01,979
- Remember me, huh?!
- My name is Martin Vail.

762
01:04:02,181 --> 01:04:04,251
I don't give a fuck!
You have no right!

763
01:04:04,461 --> 01:04:08,738
Every fucking right! I'm Aaron
Stampler's attorney, you little shit!

764
01:04:08,940 --> 01:04:12,250
Now! What do you know
about the Archbishop's murder?

765
01:04:14,780 --> 01:04:17,614
- Nothing.
- Where do you think you're going?

766
01:04:17,821 --> 01:04:20,813
Bullshit! Don't fuck with us.

767
01:04:21,021 --> 01:04:23,660
I swear I know nothing.

768
01:04:23,861 --> 01:04:26,329
What were you doing at Aaron's
house? What were you looking for?

769
01:04:28,581 --> 01:04:31,300
- A tape.
- A tape? A videotape?

770
01:04:31,501 --> 01:04:33,457
- Yeah.
- Of what?

771
01:04:37,541 --> 01:04:40,977
- Sex stuff.
- Sex stuff?

772
01:04:41,181 --> 01:04:44,059
Do I have to draw a picture for you?

773
01:04:44,261 --> 01:04:45,581
Who?

774
01:04:45,782 --> 01:04:47,773
Who?!

775
01:04:47,982 --> 01:04:49,779
Me, Linda.

776
01:04:52,821 --> 01:04:56,609
- And Aaron?
- He shot it, too, for the Archbishop.

777
01:04:57,661 --> 01:04:58,935
Are you telling...

778
01:04:59,141 --> 01:05:04,056
Are you telling me that Archbishop
Rushman is involved with sex stuff?

779
01:05:04,261 --> 01:05:06,900
Yeah, he called it "purging the devil".

780
01:05:07,101 --> 01:05:10,218
He'd say a sermon for ten minutes,
and then he would tell us what to do.

781
01:05:10,421 --> 01:05:12,491
I don't give a fuck what you believe!

782
01:05:12,941 --> 01:05:17,174
Hey, hey, hey. What were you
going to do with the tape?

783
01:05:17,382 --> 01:05:20,454
Trash it. I was gonna throw it away.

784
01:05:20,662 --> 01:05:22,300
One. Just one tape.

785
01:05:22,502 --> 01:05:24,857
One tape.
He'd keep recording over and over.

786
01:05:25,062 --> 01:05:27,098
- Why did you think Aaron had this?
- I don't know.

787
01:05:27,302 --> 01:05:30,260
I thought he got it,
and he went back and killed him.

788
01:05:30,462 --> 01:05:33,579
- He did kill him, right?
- No, he didn't.

789
01:05:35,862 --> 01:05:37,534
Where's this girl? Where's Linda?

790
01:05:43,661 --> 01:05:46,574
She freaked out!
She panicked. She split.

791
01:05:46,782 --> 01:05:49,137
And I'm not expecting any postcards.

792
01:05:54,542 --> 01:05:56,498
Look at me.

793
01:06:06,982 --> 01:06:10,497
Get him out of here, Tommy.

794
01:06:10,702 --> 01:06:12,977
- Where to?
- A warm bunk and three meals a day.

795
01:06:13,182 --> 01:06:17,256
- You can't arrest me! You're no cop!
- I used to be. Does that work for you?

796
01:06:44,022 --> 01:06:46,935
- Look who's here.
- Finish it. It's a good article.

797
01:06:47,143 --> 01:06:49,418
You know the rules.
Don't disturb anything,

798
01:06:49,623 --> 01:06:51,898
don't remove anything or it's my ass.

799
01:06:52,103 --> 01:06:54,822
Yeah, mine too. I won't touch anything.

800
01:07:52,264 --> 01:07:53,856
Excuse me.

801
01:08:03,103 --> 01:08:05,094
...preach the gospel to every...

802
01:08:10,583 --> 01:08:12,335
Hello.

803
01:08:13,743 --> 01:08:15,620
- What are you watching?
- Wait a minute.

804
01:08:15,823 --> 01:08:17,815
Go to her.

805
01:08:18,024 --> 01:08:21,061
Good. Now help her.

806
01:08:23,464 --> 01:08:26,376
That's it, Aaron. Good.

807
01:08:26,584 --> 01:08:29,098
Linda, help out.

808
01:08:29,304 --> 01:08:32,182
Good. Take offher blouse, Aaron.

809
01:08:34,224 --> 01:08:38,661
That's it. Now help him, Linda.

810
01:08:38,864 --> 01:08:42,174
Isn't that sweet, Linda? Good.

811
01:08:42,384 --> 01:08:45,342
That's it.
Now, take him in your mouth.

812
01:08:45,544 --> 01:08:47,581
Here's motive.

813
01:08:48,464 --> 01:08:50,375
Take her from behind.

814
01:08:50,584 --> 01:08:53,974
- Aaron, take her from behind.
- Jesus Christ.

815
01:08:57,944 --> 01:08:59,502
Thanks.

816
01:09:08,544 --> 01:09:11,217
- I wanna talk to you alone.
- We should discuss...

817
01:09:11,424 --> 01:09:13,938
I need to be alone with my client.

818
01:09:25,105 --> 01:09:27,414
Do you trust me?

819
01:09:29,225 --> 01:09:31,420
Yes, yes, of course I do.

820
01:09:31,625 --> 01:09:34,014
Good. Because I don't trust you.

821
01:09:39,424 --> 01:09:41,858
I'll lay it all out for you.

822
01:09:44,424 --> 01:09:49,055
I'm losing this case because
my fucking client is lying to me.

823
01:09:49,265 --> 01:09:52,655
- I never, never lied...
- Bullshit!

824
01:09:54,145 --> 01:09:56,784
No more bullshit. No more games.

825
01:09:58,145 --> 01:09:59,863
Everybody thinks you did this,
everybody.

826
01:10:00,065 --> 01:10:02,420
Only I believe you,
and I'm that close.

827
01:10:02,625 --> 01:10:06,334
So I want it all out.
Right now, right here.

828
01:10:07,945 --> 01:10:10,095
Did you underline that book?

829
01:10:10,785 --> 01:10:13,663
Hey, hey, look at me.
Did you underline that book?

830
01:10:13,865 --> 01:10:17,461
- N-n-no, I didn't.
- I don't believe you.

831
01:10:18,026 --> 01:10:19,857
- That's bullshit.
- I told...

832
01:10:20,066 --> 01:10:23,057
I don't believe you! I saw the tape!

833
01:10:24,505 --> 01:10:27,861
I saw the tape. I know what he did
to you. I wanna hear it from you.

834
01:10:28,065 --> 01:10:29,703
No! No!

835
01:10:29,905 --> 01:10:32,703
Don't do this.
I want you to tell me the truth.

836
01:10:32,905 --> 01:10:35,294
- You fucking killed him! You did it!
- No!

837
01:10:35,505 --> 01:10:38,383
You're so full of shit! You did it!
Tell me the truth. Don't lie.

838
01:10:38,585 --> 01:10:40,223
You little fuck! You killed him!

839
01:10:40,425 --> 01:10:42,893
- You son of a bitch! You killed him!
- No!

840
01:10:43,385 --> 01:10:44,977
What do you want from me now?

841
01:10:45,185 --> 01:10:48,383
Quit crying! I can't understand
a word you're saying.

842
01:10:48,586 --> 01:10:50,463
You little sissy! You make me sick!

843
01:10:54,586 --> 01:10:57,305
- Look here. Who the fuck are you?
- Who the fuck are you?

844
01:10:57,506 --> 01:11:00,578
This is my cell! Who the fuck are you?

845
01:11:03,826 --> 01:11:07,296
I got you now. You're the lawyer.

846
01:11:08,786 --> 01:11:12,175
You're a lawyer, ain't you? With
your fancy suit. I heard about you.

847
01:11:13,385 --> 01:11:16,776
My, my, you sure fucked
this one up, counsellor.

848
01:11:16,986 --> 01:11:20,899
Sounds like they're gonna shoot Aaron
so full of poison it'll come out his eyes!

849
01:11:22,426 --> 01:11:24,940
- Where is Aaron?
- He's crying in a corner somewhere.

850
01:11:25,146 --> 01:11:28,138
You scared him off!
You got to deal with me now, boy.

851
01:11:28,986 --> 01:11:31,705
I ought to give you
a beating on principle. Look at me.

852
01:11:31,906 --> 01:11:36,661
You pull that tough-guy shit on Aaron
again, I'll kick your ass to Sunday!

853
01:11:36,866 --> 01:11:39,858
- Do you understand me?
- I understand you.

854
01:11:40,066 --> 01:11:43,456
Aaron gets in trouble, he calls you.
You're the man.

855
01:11:43,666 --> 01:11:45,577
Aaron couldn't kick his own ass.

856
01:11:45,786 --> 01:11:48,506
You seen him with the "da-da-da".

857
01:11:49,147 --> 01:11:50,819
Yeah.

858
01:11:51,027 --> 01:11:52,824
Jesus Christ, he can't handle anything.

859
01:11:53,027 --> 01:11:56,383
He sure couldn't handle
all that preacher's blood.

860
01:11:56,586 --> 01:11:58,975
If he'd done like I told him,
we wouldn't be in this mess.

861
01:11:59,186 --> 01:12:01,416
But he got scared and "da".

862
01:12:01,626 --> 01:12:04,936
Ran off and got himself caught,
the stupid little shit.

863
01:12:05,146 --> 01:12:08,104
So Aaron did kill Rushman.

864
01:12:08,306 --> 01:12:11,025
Hell no! Jesus Christ,
where did they find you?

865
01:12:11,226 --> 01:12:16,300
Haven't you listened to me?
Aaron doesn't have guts to do nothing.

866
01:12:16,506 --> 01:12:18,065
It was me, boy.

867
01:12:19,827 --> 01:12:22,387
- It was you.
- Yes, it was.

868
01:12:23,387 --> 01:12:27,346
He came crying to me like always,
stuttering and whining.

869
01:12:27,547 --> 01:12:31,904
"I ca-can't take it no more, Roy.
You g-got to help me."

870
01:12:32,107 --> 01:12:33,984
"Please, please, Roy."

871
01:12:34,187 --> 01:12:39,261
I said, "Shut your mouth! Grow up.
Be a man. Take care of yourself."

872
01:12:42,587 --> 01:12:44,975
So your name is Roy?

873
01:12:45,186 --> 01:12:49,066
Oh, Jesus, I'm sorry. Yeah.
What is it? Marty?

874
01:12:49,267 --> 01:12:51,337
Marty, I'm dying for a smoke.
Do you have a cigarette?

875
01:12:51,547 --> 01:12:54,380
- No, I quit.
- Fuck that.

876
01:12:55,747 --> 01:12:57,738
Can't live without them.
Got to be a butt here.

877
01:12:57,947 --> 01:12:59,460
Roy.

878
01:13:00,427 --> 01:13:03,737
Roy, tell me about Linda.

879
01:13:05,507 --> 01:13:08,226
Linda?
Who the fuck cares about Linda?

880
01:13:08,427 --> 01:13:10,861
I care about Linda.
I'd like to know about her.

881
01:13:11,067 --> 01:13:15,060
That little tramp. Everybody
had a piece of her, you know.

882
01:13:15,267 --> 01:13:18,977
She had Aaron wrapped up so tight,
he thought she was his girlfriend.

883
01:13:19,188 --> 01:13:20,701
She broke his heart.

884
01:13:20,908 --> 01:13:25,777
So that's why you had to kill Rushman.
Because of the sex stuff.

885
01:13:28,508 --> 01:13:30,783
You've seen the tape.

886
01:13:32,907 --> 01:13:34,625
Answer me, you son of a bitch!

887
01:13:35,547 --> 01:13:40,780
Do you think I'm playing with you?
I will break your fucking neck!

888
01:13:40,987 --> 01:13:44,263
- I'll ask again. Have you seen it?
- Of course I saw the tape.

889
01:13:44,467 --> 01:13:48,905
Dammit, I told him, "Get that tape.
It's motive, you asshole!"

890
01:13:49,108 --> 01:13:52,384
This'll fuck everýthing up.
Don't you show that to anyone!

891
01:13:52,588 --> 01:13:54,465
- Do you understand me?!
- Yeah.

892
01:13:55,348 --> 01:13:56,667
- Aaron.
- Damn!

893
01:14:38,308 --> 01:14:40,219
Mist...

894
01:14:40,428 --> 01:14:42,020
Mister Vail?

895
01:14:47,989 --> 01:14:50,867
Yeah, I'm right here, Aaron.

896
01:15:13,788 --> 01:15:17,098
He did it. The little fuck did it.

897
01:15:19,629 --> 01:15:21,460
How could I have missed that?

898
01:15:21,669 --> 01:15:24,502
- Am I gonna need stitches?
- No.

899
01:15:27,069 --> 01:15:31,221
He didn't do it. Aaron has no idea
what just happened in there.

900
01:15:31,429 --> 01:15:33,260
I kept seeing the signs. The big ones.

901
01:15:33,469 --> 01:15:37,462
Abusive background, these repeated
blackouts, the ellipses in thought.

902
01:15:37,669 --> 01:15:40,502
He's ambidextrous. I tried to tell you.

903
01:15:40,709 --> 01:15:46,147
You may be thrilled by all this,
but I'm fucked. I don't have a case.

904
01:15:46,349 --> 01:15:51,344
Textbook multiple personality disorder.
Put me on the stand. I'll testify.

905
01:15:51,550 --> 01:15:53,187
He's insane.

906
01:15:53,909 --> 01:15:58,903
I can't. I can't change plea
in the middle of a trial.

907
01:15:59,749 --> 01:16:05,460
The judge would never allow it.
Insanity is the hardest thing to prove.

908
01:16:05,669 --> 01:16:07,978
OK.

909
01:16:08,189 --> 01:16:10,783
My professional opinion.

910
01:16:10,989 --> 01:16:13,981
This is not a criminal
we're dealing with. He's a sick kid.

911
01:16:14,189 --> 01:16:17,386
He's sitting in a cell,
and that's not where he belongs.

912
01:16:24,270 --> 01:16:25,908
You got an aspirin?

913
01:17:22,071 --> 01:17:24,904
Come on, Connerman, ask it.

914
01:17:25,111 --> 01:17:26,907
Ask what?

915
01:17:28,590 --> 01:17:31,900
The question
you wanted to ask me before.

916
01:17:32,110 --> 01:17:34,226
I don't understand, Mr Vail.

917
01:17:34,430 --> 01:17:38,582
"How can you defend someone
if you know they did it?"

918
01:17:38,790 --> 01:17:43,227
"How can you defend these
fucking scumbags?" Isn't that it?

919
01:17:43,430 --> 01:17:45,580
All those fucking coy questions,
all that bullshit.

920
01:17:45,790 --> 01:17:48,863
Bottom line is:
"How can you do what you do?"

921
01:17:54,431 --> 01:17:57,468
You think it's the money, don't you?

922
01:17:59,111 --> 01:18:03,582
The money's nice.
The money's very, very nice, Jack.

923
01:18:03,791 --> 01:18:07,340
The first thing I ask a new client is:

924
01:18:07,551 --> 01:18:09,542
"You been saving up for a rainy day?"

925
01:18:09,751 --> 01:18:13,460
"Guess what? It's raining."

926
01:18:15,550 --> 01:18:18,429
You think it's because I want to see
my face on magazine covers?

927
01:18:20,071 --> 01:18:25,987
My 1 5 seconds on TV? I love it.
I fucking love that shit. I really do.

928
01:18:26,191 --> 01:18:28,341
But guess what?

929
01:18:28,551 --> 01:18:30,303
It's not it.

930
01:18:33,751 --> 01:18:36,424
- You go to Las Vegas?
- Yeah.

931
01:18:36,631 --> 01:18:39,782
I don't go to Vegas.
Why don't I go to Vegas?

932
01:18:39,991 --> 01:18:42,300
Marty, it's late.
I think we should just get up and...

933
01:18:42,511 --> 01:18:46,470
Why gamble with money when you
can gamble with people's lives?

934
01:18:49,472 --> 01:18:51,428
That was a joke.

935
01:18:53,832 --> 01:18:56,665
All right, I'll tell you.

936
01:19:00,991 --> 01:19:05,746
I believe in the notion that people
are innocent until proven guilty.

937
01:19:05,951 --> 01:19:09,421
I believe in that notion
because I choose to believe

938
01:19:09,631 --> 01:19:12,862
in the basic goodness of people.

939
01:19:13,071 --> 01:19:17,826
I choose to believe that not all crimes
are committed by bad people.

940
01:19:18,031 --> 01:19:20,830
And I try to understand

941
01:19:21,032 --> 01:19:24,866
that some very good people
do some very bad things.

942
01:19:40,112 --> 01:19:43,070
You know when I was working
for Shaughnessy,

943
01:19:43,272 --> 01:19:46,787
I did something very, very bad.

944
01:19:46,992 --> 01:19:51,224
Illegal. I was a prosecutor then.

945
01:19:51,432 --> 01:19:55,983
This thing I did. I was very upset by it
and decided to leave.

946
01:19:56,192 --> 01:20:00,071
So I left.
I became a defending attorney.

947
01:20:00,272 --> 01:20:04,026
The irony being that everyone
assumed I was lying anyhow.

948
01:20:04,232 --> 01:20:07,383
I made myself this little promise that...

949
01:20:09,992 --> 01:20:13,428
...l would reserve my lies
for other than my public life.

950
01:20:25,633 --> 01:20:28,830
You print any of this,
I'll sue your fucking ass.

951
01:20:54,233 --> 01:20:57,031
- All right, so I made a little mistake.
- No shit.

952
01:20:58,393 --> 01:21:01,385
What do you want? A new suit?
I'll buy you a new suit.

953
01:21:01,593 --> 01:21:04,949
You made a mistake?
You told us the third man did it.

954
01:21:05,153 --> 01:21:08,190
You got your third man.
And a fourth man and a fifth man...

955
01:21:08,393 --> 01:21:10,668
What are you going to do, Marty?

956
01:21:10,873 --> 01:21:13,467
I don't know. I really fucked up here.

957
01:21:14,313 --> 01:21:16,190
You were right.

958
01:21:16,393 --> 01:21:20,990
- So how are you gonna get him off?
- I don't know.

959
01:21:22,553 --> 01:21:26,182
What I know is that Aaron did
not commit first-degree murder.

960
01:21:26,393 --> 01:21:29,305
- He stabbed him a billion times...
- Not Aaron.

961
01:21:29,513 --> 01:21:34,109
To convict someone of a capital crime
the State must prove intent.

962
01:21:34,313 --> 01:21:38,067
- Roy had intent, Aaron didn't.
- Then you have to plead insanity...

963
01:21:38,273 --> 01:21:41,424
...which we can't do mid-trial,
unless you plan a career change.

964
01:21:41,633 --> 01:21:43,942
I could've been mistaken,
but I wasn't wrong.

965
01:21:44,153 --> 01:21:47,429
Aaron is innocent.
It's Roy who is guilty.

966
01:21:47,633 --> 01:21:49,465
He doesn't need a lawyer,
he needs an exorcist.

967
01:21:49,674 --> 01:21:52,632
You're full of shit.
You weren't there. You didn't see it.

968
01:21:52,834 --> 01:21:57,589
He's one sick boy who's been fucked
around by his father, by his priest.

969
01:21:57,794 --> 01:22:02,345
It's our job to make sure the jury
believes he doesn't deserve to die.

970
01:22:02,554 --> 01:22:05,148
- OK.
- OK. How do we do it?

971
01:22:06,914 --> 01:22:09,905
By somehow introducing
this whole abuse thing.

972
01:22:16,113 --> 01:22:20,073
- The tape.
- That's crazy. That gives him motive.

973
01:22:20,274 --> 01:22:23,346
No, it looks like that, but it's...

974
01:22:23,554 --> 01:22:27,308
No, actually,
it turns this whole thing around.

975
01:22:27,514 --> 01:22:31,507
It gives concrete documentation
of what Rushman did to this kid.

976
01:22:31,714 --> 01:22:33,830
But we can't put it in. You know that.

977
01:22:35,634 --> 01:22:37,625
But we're not going to.

978
01:22:44,194 --> 01:22:46,264
Oh, fuck!

979
01:22:53,475 --> 01:22:56,228
- OK.
- Good.

980
01:23:30,515 --> 01:23:33,871
What the hell are you doing?
You know damn well who it is.

981
01:23:34,075 --> 01:23:36,225
- Barleycorn's, Marty. Now.
- Janet?

982
01:23:36,435 --> 01:23:38,790
Cute porno. Part of your collection?

983
01:23:52,675 --> 01:23:53,949
Hey.

984
01:23:55,395 --> 01:23:58,353
Where did you get it? Steal it?

985
01:23:58,555 --> 01:24:00,466
- From the crime scene?
- I don't know anything...

986
01:24:00,675 --> 01:24:02,825
- You are such a liar.
- Think about it.

987
01:24:03,035 --> 01:24:06,425
If it contains that,
I wouldn't give it to you. It's motive.

988
01:24:06,635 --> 01:24:07,988
You had to give it to me.

989
01:24:08,195 --> 01:24:12,347
If you introduced it, the jury'd despise
you for dishonouring the bishop.

990
01:24:12,555 --> 01:24:16,673
If you get me to show it, motive or
no motive, I'm the one who looks bad,

991
01:24:16,875 --> 01:24:20,994
and you gain sympathy
for your poor, little, abused boy.

992
01:24:21,836 --> 01:24:23,474
- You think so?
- I hate you.

993
01:24:26,396 --> 01:24:27,670
Don't use it.

994
01:24:29,716 --> 01:24:32,388
I have no intention of using it.

995
01:24:34,075 --> 01:24:36,987
- The usual, Stu.
- You got it.

996
01:24:42,195 --> 01:24:45,073
- You're up to even more than that.
- I'm not up to anything.

997
01:24:45,275 --> 01:24:49,269
You're opening a door for me with
a tiger on the other end, and I don't...

998
01:24:49,476 --> 01:24:52,195
You know who you'd really upset?
Shaughnessy.

999
01:24:52,396 --> 01:24:54,114
- Fuck him.
- Fuck him?

1000
01:24:54,316 --> 01:24:56,625
Fuck you.

1001
01:24:59,436 --> 01:25:01,586
Thanks a lot.

1002
01:25:03,796 --> 01:25:07,425
- If this is not your motive, what is?
- I have motive.

1003
01:25:08,156 --> 01:25:09,794
Yeah, what is it?

1004
01:25:11,276 --> 01:25:13,949
I'm really gonna tell you.

1005
01:25:14,156 --> 01:25:16,590
Better tell the jury soon.
Time's running out.

1006
01:25:16,796 --> 01:25:18,228
Here you go.

1007
01:25:20,436 --> 01:25:23,109
You think you've got me, huh?

1008
01:25:24,556 --> 01:25:30,472
You think because you know me as
well as you do, you know how I think.

1009
01:25:30,676 --> 01:25:33,474
Well, I know how you think.

1010
01:25:38,756 --> 01:25:40,986
You know what I'm thinking?

1011
01:25:46,316 --> 01:25:48,705
What happened to your face?

1012
01:25:48,916 --> 01:25:52,956
I... I bumped it
in a medicine cabinet.

1013
01:25:57,837 --> 01:26:01,068
No, that was a girl on her way out.

1014
01:26:06,356 --> 01:26:09,985
- We should come back here later.
- They close in ten minutes.

1015
01:26:10,196 --> 01:26:12,107
No, after.

1016
01:26:12,316 --> 01:26:14,352
After the trial.

1017
01:26:15,516 --> 01:26:17,632
When we got nothing to lose.

1018
01:26:21,317 --> 01:26:24,468
How can your timing
be so good in a courtroom

1019
01:26:24,677 --> 01:26:27,032
and so bad in real life?

1020
01:26:29,837 --> 01:26:34,388
I'll think about it later.
I hate you too much right now.

1021
01:26:44,957 --> 01:26:47,312
You got a visitor.

1022
01:26:47,957 --> 01:26:49,949
Here she comes.

1023
01:26:51,838 --> 01:26:54,112
Talk to you later.

1024
01:26:54,317 --> 01:26:56,228
Janet.

1025
01:26:56,437 --> 01:26:58,314
Morning.

1026
01:27:01,597 --> 01:27:03,952
So where's the tape?

1027
01:27:04,157 --> 01:27:06,717
There's some pretty ugly stuff
on that tape.

1028
01:27:06,917 --> 01:27:10,114
- Yes, there is.
- Who would've thought?

1029
01:27:12,037 --> 01:27:15,996
- Where did it come from?
- Landed on my front door. No note.

1030
01:27:16,197 --> 01:27:18,108
- Vail?
- Who else?

1031
01:27:18,317 --> 01:27:20,707
Clever prick.

1032
01:27:20,918 --> 01:27:23,068
What do you think he's up to?

1033
01:27:23,278 --> 01:27:25,394
- I honestly don't know.
- Cut the crap.

1034
01:27:25,598 --> 01:27:28,112
You know him well.
You were balling him.

1035
01:27:30,518 --> 01:27:32,395
- Where is it?
- At home.

1036
01:27:35,638 --> 01:27:37,868
I have some advice for you.

1037
01:27:38,078 --> 01:27:41,706
If you have aspirations beyond
this particular office,

1038
01:27:41,917 --> 01:27:45,432
pick up your handbag,
go home and destroy this tape

1039
01:27:45,637 --> 01:27:48,356
you should've destroyed, like I did.

1040
01:27:49,878 --> 01:27:51,755
You don't think Vail has a copy?

1041
01:27:51,958 --> 01:27:54,791
You don't think there's an original?

1042
01:27:58,038 --> 01:28:00,836
Stampler is on trial,
not the Catholic church.

1043
01:28:01,038 --> 01:28:04,587
If you haven't found another motive
to hang him on, God help you.

1044
01:28:15,118 --> 01:28:17,678
All rise.

1045
01:28:18,718 --> 01:28:21,153
Please, sit down.

1046
01:28:25,319 --> 01:28:27,468
Madame Prosecutor.

1047
01:28:32,918 --> 01:28:34,636
Miss Venable.

1048
01:28:35,998 --> 01:28:39,149
The State calls Thomas Goodman.

1049
01:28:39,358 --> 01:28:40,632
Objection, Your Honour.

1050
01:28:40,838 --> 01:28:44,387
Prosecution knows Mr Goodman
is my investigator in this case,

1051
01:28:44,598 --> 01:28:47,351
and under the Work Product Rule
he can't be compelled to testify.

1052
01:28:47,558 --> 01:28:49,833
- Permission to approach the bench?
- Granted.

1053
01:28:56,719 --> 01:29:00,507
I have important evidence
which the witness can authenticate.

1054
01:29:00,719 --> 01:29:05,918
That's Mr Vail's privilege. If he doesn't
want Goodman to testify, he won't.

1055
01:29:06,119 --> 01:29:08,633
Make a decision, Mr Vail.

1056
01:29:11,319 --> 01:29:14,355
- You ever been to my apartment?
- No.

1057
01:29:14,558 --> 01:29:17,834
- By that I mean my apartment building.
- Allegedly.

1058
01:29:18,038 --> 01:29:22,430
I'm sorry. You have or you haven't.
"Allegedly" doesn't figure into it.

1059
01:29:23,239 --> 01:29:26,390
I have...been there, yes.

1060
01:29:26,599 --> 01:29:29,875
- Why did you go there?
- I was delivering something.

1061
01:29:30,079 --> 01:29:32,274
For whom?

1062
01:29:33,599 --> 01:29:34,793
Martin Vail.

1063
01:29:34,999 --> 01:29:38,958
Mr Vail sent you
to deliver something to me.

1064
01:29:39,159 --> 01:29:41,548
- Yes.
- What was it?

1065
01:29:42,999 --> 01:29:44,273
A video tape.

1066
01:29:44,479 --> 01:29:47,516
Could this be the tape
you delivered for Mr Vail?

1067
01:29:47,719 --> 01:29:49,471
I have a feeling it is, yes.

1068
01:29:49,679 --> 01:29:52,672
The People place
this video tape in evidence.

1069
01:29:52,880 --> 01:29:54,438
So ordered. Please index.

1070
01:29:54,640 --> 01:29:58,553
Where did Mr Vail get this tape,
if it is the same one?

1071
01:29:58,760 --> 01:30:02,434
He took it from the closet
of Archbishop Rushman.

1072
01:30:02,639 --> 01:30:04,277
- Stole it.
- Borrowed it.

1073
01:30:04,479 --> 01:30:07,915
Once I made the transfer for him,
I returned it.

1074
01:30:08,119 --> 01:30:10,474
Can you describe what's on the tape?

1075
01:30:10,679 --> 01:30:15,355
There was a sermon
by Archbishop Rushman, a rehearsal,

1076
01:30:15,559 --> 01:30:17,231
followed by...

1077
01:30:20,039 --> 01:30:23,919
- ..a kind of home movie.
- A home movie? Of what?

1078
01:30:24,120 --> 01:30:25,473
- Some altar boys.
- And?

1079
01:30:26,960 --> 01:30:28,439
- A girl.
- Doing what?

1080
01:30:31,280 --> 01:30:34,317
An altar boy lesson of some kind?

1081
01:30:35,800 --> 01:30:37,870
Having sex.

1082
01:30:38,880 --> 01:30:40,632
Quiet.

1083
01:30:40,840 --> 01:30:43,718
A porno movie.

1084
01:30:43,920 --> 01:30:45,194
- Mm, yes.
- Yes. Now.

1085
01:30:45,400 --> 01:30:50,234
How is it that this tape, this porno tape,

1086
01:30:50,440 --> 01:30:54,115
was in the Archbishop's closet
in order for Vail to find it there?

1087
01:30:54,320 --> 01:30:58,074
- He was the...director.
- Who was?

1088
01:30:58,280 --> 01:31:01,750
- Archbishop Rushman.
- Quiet!

1089
01:31:03,600 --> 01:31:08,435
And was the defendant one of
the altar boys performing in the movie?

1090
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:14,391
- Yes, he was.
- Was his girlfriend, Linda Forbes?

1091
01:31:15,480 --> 01:31:16,799
Yes, she was.

1092
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:20,516
Did it appear to you
that the defendant was enjoying

1093
01:31:20,721 --> 01:31:23,281
performing in this film
with his girlfriend?

1094
01:31:23,481 --> 01:31:25,551
No, he does not.

1095
01:31:26,401 --> 01:31:30,110
I will not ask you if you
think we've uncovered motive here.

1096
01:31:30,321 --> 01:31:34,791
We will decide that for ourselves
once we've all seen the video tape.

1097
01:31:35,600 --> 01:31:38,194
No further questions.

1098
01:31:39,280 --> 01:31:42,636
Does Defence wish to cross?

1099
01:31:44,840 --> 01:31:47,229
- No, Your Honour.
- Court's in recess.

1100
01:31:47,440 --> 01:31:51,070
Bailiff, please set up for the tape.
Mr Goodman, you're excused.

1101
01:31:55,401 --> 01:31:57,915
Thanks for the advice.

1102
01:32:03,201 --> 01:32:06,591
- Mr Vail said she was your girlfriend.
- Yes, she was.

1103
01:32:06,801 --> 01:32:11,431
- How did you meet?
- We were both at the Savior House.

1104
01:32:11,641 --> 01:32:13,996
I was an altar boy,

1105
01:32:14,201 --> 01:32:19,150
and she was working
for Bishop Rushman.

1106
01:32:19,361 --> 01:32:21,478
Doing what?

1107
01:32:26,841 --> 01:32:29,719
Were you sleeping
with anyone else at the time?

1108
01:32:29,921 --> 01:32:32,389
- No, no.
- Was she?

1109
01:32:34,641 --> 01:32:36,950
N-n-no.

1110
01:32:38,521 --> 01:32:40,910
Has she been to see you, Aaron?

1111
01:32:41,121 --> 01:32:44,397
Yeah. Yeah, I'm still here.

1112
01:32:46,681 --> 01:32:48,194
What?

1113
01:33:30,162 --> 01:33:33,313
Mr Vail, are you prepared to proceed
with your first witness?

1114
01:33:45,762 --> 01:33:49,038
Yes, Your Honour.
The Defence calls John Shaughnessy.

1115
01:33:54,243 --> 01:33:56,915
The People object. Mr Shaughnessy
has never been identified as...

1116
01:33:57,122 --> 01:34:00,558
- Your Honour, may I approach?
- Yes, you may.

1117
01:34:04,002 --> 01:34:08,359
My client is on trial for his life. He
maintains there was a third person.

1118
01:34:08,562 --> 01:34:10,951
Can Mr Shaughnessy confirm that?

1119
01:34:11,162 --> 01:34:14,393
The US Constitution
takes precedence here,

1120
01:34:14,602 --> 01:34:17,400
permitting calling any witness
to prove innocence.

1121
01:34:17,602 --> 01:34:22,040
That's stated in the Sixth Amendment
and profound in Brady vs. Maryland.

1122
01:34:24,083 --> 01:34:29,362
Mr Shaughnessy, you sit on the board
of the Rushman Foundation?

1123
01:34:29,563 --> 01:34:31,519
I am an honorary board member.

1124
01:34:31,723 --> 01:34:34,760
Explain the nature
and purpose of this foundation.

1125
01:34:34,963 --> 01:34:37,033
It was founded by the late Archbishop.

1126
01:34:37,243 --> 01:34:41,441
Its purpose is to invest in projects
for the greater good of the community.

1127
01:34:41,643 --> 01:34:44,395
The greater good of the community,
OK.

1128
01:34:44,602 --> 01:34:48,231
Would that be true
in the case of the now bankrupt...

1129
01:34:48,442 --> 01:34:51,674
- ...South River Housing Development?
- Yes.

1130
01:34:51,883 --> 01:34:55,956
Could you tell the court why the South
River project was abandoned?

1131
01:34:56,163 --> 01:34:58,836
There was a difference of opinion
as to the costs.

1132
01:34:59,043 --> 01:35:01,603
Wasn't there also
a difference of opinion

1133
01:35:01,803 --> 01:35:04,795
between the investors
and the late Archbishop?

1134
01:35:05,003 --> 01:35:08,200
- I don't recall.
- You don't...

1135
01:35:09,283 --> 01:35:12,036
What kind of money
are we talking about?

1136
01:35:14,603 --> 01:35:20,997
How much money was invested
in this failed South River enterprise?

1137
01:35:24,804 --> 01:35:27,716
- 60 million dollars.
- Quiet.

1138
01:35:27,924 --> 01:35:29,801
60 million dollars!

1139
01:35:31,603 --> 01:35:33,833
Wow, that's a lot of money.

1140
01:35:34,763 --> 01:35:37,641
You and the Archbishop
have been friends for 20 years?

1141
01:35:37,843 --> 01:35:40,915
- You knew each other well.
- That's right.

1142
01:35:41,123 --> 01:35:45,002
- Did that tape's content surprise you?
- Yes, of course.

1143
01:35:45,203 --> 01:35:48,718
You've never heard any allegations
against the Archbishop?

1144
01:35:48,923 --> 01:35:50,322
Not that I recall, no.

1145
01:35:50,523 --> 01:35:53,596
Especially since you were State's
Attorney for the last 1 5 years,

1146
01:35:53,804 --> 01:35:58,036
you've supervised all prosecutions
in Cook County during that time,

1147
01:35:58,244 --> 01:36:01,156
especially the prosecutions
of prominent figures.

1148
01:36:01,364 --> 01:36:04,800
I also have a staff of
a thousand of the best prosecutors...

1149
01:36:05,004 --> 01:36:09,122
As State's Attorney
it was up to you, ultimately, to decide...

1150
01:36:09,324 --> 01:36:11,997
- ...who would be indicted.
- Yes.

1151
01:36:14,684 --> 01:36:16,800
Let me just take you back now.

1152
01:36:17,004 --> 01:36:21,235
Let's go back to June 1 985.

1153
01:36:22,364 --> 01:36:25,356
Do you recall any allegations
of sexual misconduct...

1154
01:36:25,564 --> 01:36:29,159
- ...against the Archbishop then?
- I don't recall that, no.

1155
01:36:29,364 --> 01:36:33,596
Do you recall a young man
by the name of Michael O'Donnell

1156
01:36:33,804 --> 01:36:38,002
who came to the felony review unit
at your office?

1157
01:36:41,844 --> 01:36:44,961
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

1158
01:36:45,164 --> 01:36:51,638
That's confusing because a document
from the Chicago Metropolitan Police

1159
01:36:51,845 --> 01:36:57,636
says that Michael O'Donnell spoke
to the supervisor for two weeks,

1160
01:36:57,845 --> 01:37:02,043
explaining sexual abuse he suffered
at the hands of Archbishop Rushman.

1161
01:37:03,685 --> 01:37:08,678
Isn't it also true, Mr State's Attorney,
that you then decided that your friend

1162
01:37:08,884 --> 01:37:12,763
was not going to stand trial
for any of it?

1163
01:37:12,964 --> 01:37:14,682
He owed you big time, John.

1164
01:37:14,884 --> 01:37:18,001
You must have been pissed off
when he pulled out of South River.

1165
01:37:18,964 --> 01:37:23,083
He just said, "I can't take it any more"?
He said, "No!"

1166
01:37:23,285 --> 01:37:27,119
You and your investors
had 60 million reasons to kill him!

1167
01:37:27,325 --> 01:37:30,476
- You little cocksucker!
- That's it. Witness dismissed.

1168
01:37:30,685 --> 01:37:34,121
- Vail, in my chambers now.
- That's for Joey Pinero, shithead.

1169
01:37:39,125 --> 01:37:41,639
Start looking for a job.

1170
01:37:50,285 --> 01:37:55,040
You think you can use my courtroom to
wage vendettas and settle old scores,

1171
01:37:55,245 --> 01:37:57,156
you are sorely mistaken.

1172
01:37:57,365 --> 01:38:00,437
I'm striking Shaughnessy's testimony
from the record as irrelevant,

1173
01:38:00,645 --> 01:38:03,796
and I'm holding you in contempt
to the tune of 1 0,000 dollars.

1174
01:38:04,005 --> 01:38:07,600
You're saying that I can't get
a fair trial in your courtroom?

1175
01:38:07,805 --> 01:38:10,842
Be very careful, Mr Vail.
You're on dangerous ground.

1176
01:38:11,045 --> 01:38:13,354
You want the cheque
made out to you?

1177
01:38:13,565 --> 01:38:16,033
You want me to take you off this case?

1178
01:38:16,245 --> 01:38:19,396
You're making a mockery of
my courtroom, and I won't allow it.

1179
01:38:19,605 --> 01:38:25,044
I suggest you start representing your
client and stop representing yourself.

1180
01:38:33,606 --> 01:38:37,042
- Can we do this later?
- No, I want to stay with this.

1181
01:38:38,246 --> 01:38:42,397
- I'm feeling very, very tired.
- Yeah, I know.

1182
01:38:42,605 --> 01:38:44,675
Why does talking
about Linda Forbes upset you?

1183
01:38:44,885 --> 01:38:46,762
It doesn't. Ijust...

1184
01:38:48,965 --> 01:38:51,638
- OK.
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1185
01:38:55,046 --> 01:38:59,403
- You know what I can do with this?
- How the fuck should I know!

1186
01:39:07,886 --> 01:39:11,845
Dr Arrington, how much time
have you spent with Aaron Stampler?

1187
01:39:12,046 --> 01:39:16,005
- Around 60 hours.
- What did you find in your evaluation?

1188
01:39:16,206 --> 01:39:19,801
Mr Stampler suffers from
an acute disassociative condition.

1189
01:39:20,006 --> 01:39:23,841
- Multiple personality disorder.
- Objection, Your Honour.

1190
01:39:24,047 --> 01:39:26,321
She's only stating
what she's personally observed.

1191
01:39:26,526 --> 01:39:28,562
- Your Honour.
- Counsellors.

1192
01:39:30,406 --> 01:39:33,637
- I know what you're doing.
- Excuse us for a minute?

1193
01:39:35,526 --> 01:39:38,040
If he wants to question
his client's sanity...

1194
01:39:38,246 --> 01:39:40,680
I'm trying to establish
a medical basis for amnesia.

1195
01:39:40,886 --> 01:39:43,923
That's not what he's doing.
He's saying he's crazy.

1196
01:39:44,126 --> 01:39:47,004
- Are you?
- No, I am not.

1197
01:39:47,206 --> 01:39:51,279
I'll allow you to proceed
with this witness if you're very careful.

1198
01:39:51,486 --> 01:39:54,524
Absolutely. Yes.

1199
01:39:54,727 --> 01:39:56,445
Write down that he said that.

1200
01:39:57,407 --> 01:40:00,285
All right, where were we?

1201
01:40:03,847 --> 01:40:06,839
Now, could Aaron Stampler

1202
01:40:07,047 --> 01:40:11,563
have been present during the murder
of Archbishop Rushman...

1203
01:40:11,767 --> 01:40:13,643
- ...and not remember it?
- Yes, he could.

1204
01:40:13,846 --> 01:40:16,121
Could you explain that, please?

1205
01:40:16,326 --> 01:40:20,638
Stampler's state was such that his
body could be present at a homicide,

1206
01:40:20,846 --> 01:40:23,566
and yet his mind
would be unable to recall it.

1207
01:40:23,767 --> 01:40:27,043
- How would this be possible?
- This neurological mechanism...

1208
01:40:27,247 --> 01:40:30,683
...began with the early abuse
suffered at the hands of his father.

1209
01:40:30,887 --> 01:40:36,041
In defence Aaron's psyche splintered
into two separate personalities.

1210
01:40:36,247 --> 01:40:38,761
- Your Honour.
- I didn't say it. I did not say it...

1211
01:40:38,967 --> 01:40:42,403
You've been warned twice.
You wanna pursue this?

1212
01:40:42,607 --> 01:40:46,839
And I suggest you think long and hard
before answering.

1213
01:40:48,447 --> 01:40:50,915
Your Honour, just one last question.

1214
01:40:55,608 --> 01:40:58,076
All right, Dr Arrington...

1215
01:40:59,008 --> 01:41:03,762
...in your opinion is Aaron Stampler
capable of murder?

1216
01:41:03,967 --> 01:41:07,755
No, he's far too traumatised to
express normal anger and frustration.

1217
01:41:07,967 --> 01:41:09,798
He keeps his emotions repressed,

1218
01:41:10,007 --> 01:41:12,282
which is why he created Roy,
who is capable...

1219
01:41:12,487 --> 01:41:14,796
- Objection.
- That's enough, Mr Vail.

1220
01:41:15,007 --> 01:41:18,886
The jury will disregard this witness'
last statement, as will the court.

1221
01:41:19,087 --> 01:41:22,922
- Prosecutor, do you wish to cross?
- You bet I do.

1222
01:41:24,408 --> 01:41:27,798
Since you brought it up,
against the instructions of the court,

1223
01:41:28,008 --> 01:41:32,604
is multiple personality disorder
your primary area of expertise?

1224
01:41:32,808 --> 01:41:34,526
It's not my primary field, no.

1225
01:41:34,728 --> 01:41:38,516
Is forensic psychiatry
your primary area of expertise?

1226
01:41:38,728 --> 01:41:41,447
- No, I'm a neuropsychologist.
- I see.

1227
01:41:41,648 --> 01:41:47,483
So you have no forensic experience
and you're more of an academic?

1228
01:41:49,127 --> 01:41:52,164
Then you will forgive
this rather academic question.

1229
01:41:52,768 --> 01:41:55,646
I'm driving, somebody cuts me off.

1230
01:41:55,848 --> 01:41:58,965
I feel like killing this guy,
but I don't. Now do l?

1231
01:41:59,168 --> 01:42:01,204
- I would hope not.
- That's right.

1232
01:42:01,408 --> 01:42:04,798
Things happen to us.
People wrong us.

1233
01:42:05,008 --> 01:42:09,286
But we don't all invent psychopaths
to do our dirty work for us, doctor?

1234
01:42:09,488 --> 01:42:12,286
I'm not suggesting
you have multiple personalities.

1235
01:42:12,488 --> 01:42:14,763
- I'm saying Mr Stampler does.
- Yes, I know. We heard.

1236
01:42:17,208 --> 01:42:22,407
You have also testified that you have
met this... What was his name again?

1237
01:42:22,609 --> 01:42:24,167
- Roy.
- Roy what?

1238
01:42:24,689 --> 01:42:26,645
- He didn't give a last name.
- I see.

1239
01:42:26,849 --> 01:42:30,842
Did this Roy tell you
that he had murdered the Archbishop?

1240
01:42:31,049 --> 01:42:33,404
Mr Vail was with him, I was outside,

1241
01:42:33,609 --> 01:42:36,566
but soon after I was in the room
and saw both Roy

1242
01:42:36,768 --> 01:42:39,566
and his transformation back to Aaron.

1243
01:42:39,768 --> 01:42:44,683
Did you happen to tape
this appearance of Aaron...?

1244
01:42:46,368 --> 01:42:50,566
Oh, I'm sorry.
I just cannot get used to this name.

1245
01:42:50,768 --> 01:42:53,408
- Roy.
- Did you?

1246
01:42:54,729 --> 01:42:57,084
- No, the tape was off.
- Off?

1247
01:42:59,609 --> 01:43:04,478
So you have no record whatsoever
of his appearance.

1248
01:43:04,689 --> 01:43:06,486
- No.
- No.

1249
01:43:08,209 --> 01:43:11,838
- Does Aaron know right from wrong?
- Yes, he does.

1250
01:43:12,049 --> 01:43:14,882
- If Aaron butchered the Archbishop...
- Objection.

1251
01:43:15,089 --> 01:43:18,923
...would he know
if Aaron murdered the Archbishop?

1252
01:43:19,129 --> 01:43:23,407
- Would he know he'd broken the law?
- Yes, he would. But it wasn't Aaron...

1253
01:43:23,609 --> 01:43:27,238
Oh, yes, I know, doctor. It was Roy.

1254
01:43:30,369 --> 01:43:33,327
That's all.
No further questions, Your Honour.

1255
01:43:33,529 --> 01:43:35,201
Witness may step down.

1256
01:43:35,409 --> 01:43:39,846
If you'd like to re-open your case
and call the State's psychiatrist...

1257
01:43:40,049 --> 01:43:42,768
- ...l will certainly agree to it.
- No, l...

1258
01:43:42,969 --> 01:43:46,928
I don't think that's necessary.
I think we all get the picture here.

1259
01:43:47,129 --> 01:43:50,360
Mr Vail, are you ready to proceed?

1260
01:43:53,170 --> 01:43:54,603
Would you like a recess?

1261
01:44:57,370 --> 01:44:58,723
Roy?

1262
01:45:00,170 --> 01:45:01,967
Aaron.

1263
01:45:04,730 --> 01:45:08,928
Could you tell us a little about
your relationship with the Archbishop?

1264
01:45:09,130 --> 01:45:13,521
Well, he was like a father to me.
I loved him very much.

1265
01:45:13,730 --> 01:45:15,800
Why did you love him?

1266
01:45:16,010 --> 01:45:17,648
- Why?
- Aha.

1267
01:45:18,690 --> 01:45:21,841
Well, he...he s-saved my life.

1268
01:45:22,610 --> 01:45:27,366
He was the only person who ever
treated me like I was worth anything.

1269
01:45:27,571 --> 01:45:29,846
Stop your whining, little girl. Be a man.

1270
01:45:33,851 --> 01:45:37,890
We've all seen that tape
that you were in, Aaron.

1271
01:45:38,091 --> 01:45:42,004
How did that make you feel? Did it
change your feelings about Rushman?

1272
01:45:42,211 --> 01:45:44,041
No.

1273
01:45:44,250 --> 01:45:46,969
He was a wonderful man.

1274
01:45:47,170 --> 01:45:51,561
So you didn't feel anger towards him
for forcing you to perform in that tape?

1275
01:45:51,770 --> 01:45:55,047
No, he did everýthing for me.

1276
01:45:55,251 --> 01:45:58,607
There was nothing else
I could do for him, and he needed it.

1277
01:45:58,811 --> 01:46:01,405
Do you know someone named Roy?

1278
01:46:03,811 --> 01:46:05,642
No, I don't.

1279
01:46:05,851 --> 01:46:10,641
You heard Dr Arrington's testimony
about what she and I saw at the jail.

1280
01:46:10,851 --> 01:46:13,809
There are strange things going on.
Do you remember?

1281
01:46:14,011 --> 01:46:17,924
I heard what she said,
but I don't remember any of that.

1282
01:46:18,131 --> 01:46:21,407
Did you kill Archbishop Rushman?

1283
01:46:22,331 --> 01:46:24,607
No, sir, I did not.

1284
01:46:29,931 --> 01:46:31,649
Thank you.

1285
01:46:33,731 --> 01:46:35,801
Your witness.

1286
01:46:42,131 --> 01:46:45,203
Mr Stampler,
would you like some water?

1287
01:46:48,731 --> 01:46:51,848
- N-no, ma'am.
- You sure?

1288
01:46:52,691 --> 01:46:54,967
Ye-yes, ma'am.

1289
01:47:02,412 --> 01:47:05,643
Mr Stampler, did you believe
that the Archbishop wore masks?

1290
01:47:09,372 --> 01:47:11,090
I'm sorry, what did you say?

1291
01:47:11,292 --> 01:47:16,241
Do you think he acted one way
in public and another way in private?

1292
01:47:16,452 --> 01:47:18,885
N-no, I don't think that.

1293
01:47:19,091 --> 01:47:21,810
Isn't that why you underlined
the Hawthorne passage?

1294
01:47:23,932 --> 01:47:25,650
Mr Stampler?

1295
01:47:27,852 --> 01:47:29,888
No, I did not underline that book.

1296
01:47:30,092 --> 01:47:32,845
- You didn't underline it?
- No, ma'am.

1297
01:47:33,052 --> 01:47:36,124
And you didn't carve the numbers
of that passage into his chest?

1298
01:47:36,332 --> 01:47:40,007
No, ma'am, I did not.
I told you l...

1299
01:47:40,212 --> 01:47:42,567
You loved him.

1300
01:47:42,772 --> 01:47:45,286
You loved him like a father.

1301
01:47:45,492 --> 01:47:48,325
Even though
he made you and your girlfriend

1302
01:47:48,532 --> 01:47:52,491
perform demeaning sexual acts
for his own gratification.

1303
01:47:52,692 --> 01:47:55,002
No, you don't understand. He...

1304
01:47:55,213 --> 01:47:59,809
There was no other way for him
to cast out his demons. He...

1305
01:48:00,013 --> 01:48:03,642
He needed to get off, Aaron.
That's what he was doing.

1306
01:48:03,853 --> 01:48:07,322
That's what he needed you for.
To perform like a circus animal.

1307
01:48:07,532 --> 01:48:09,921
- That was your function in his life.
- N-no.

1308
01:48:10,132 --> 01:48:14,045
Oh, Mr Stampler, I'm gonna ask
you straight because I am tired.

1309
01:48:14,252 --> 01:48:17,608
I've had enough of this sordidness,
and I wanna go home.

1310
01:48:17,812 --> 01:48:21,805
And I wanna wash my hands,
and I wanna forget all about you

1311
01:48:22,012 --> 01:48:23,731
and Archbishop Rushman.

1312
01:48:23,933 --> 01:48:27,164
Did the Archbishop force you
and your girlfriend and others

1313
01:48:27,373 --> 01:48:31,252
to perform sexual acts
while he watched? Yes or no?

1314
01:48:34,053 --> 01:48:36,692
- Yes, he did, but...
- Yes. Yes, he forced you.

1315
01:48:36,893 --> 01:48:40,772
He forced you using a threat
of expulsion from Savior House

1316
01:48:40,973 --> 01:48:45,364
and a life on the street with no heat
and no water and no food.

1317
01:48:45,573 --> 01:48:48,724
He put you in front of a camera!
He made you take off your clothes!

1318
01:48:48,933 --> 01:48:51,969
And you don't think
that's another side?

1319
01:48:52,172 --> 01:48:53,925
Another face of a man
that we all thought...

1320
01:48:54,133 --> 01:48:57,887
- No! No.
- Someone did that to me, I'd kill him.

1321
01:48:58,733 --> 01:49:01,850
I would stab him 78 times
with a butcher knife!

1322
01:49:02,053 --> 01:49:04,362
I would chop off his fingers!
I would slash his throat open!

1323
01:49:04,573 --> 01:49:09,852
I would carve numbers into his chest!
I would gouge out his eyes! I swear.

1324
01:49:11,573 --> 01:49:13,564
But that's me.

1325
01:49:21,693 --> 01:49:24,766
- No further questions.
- Where the hell are you going?

1326
01:49:24,974 --> 01:49:27,363
Look at me
when I'm talking to you, bitch!

1327
01:49:27,934 --> 01:49:29,447
Fuck you, lady! Come here!

1328
01:49:29,654 --> 01:49:31,212
Order! Bailiff! Order!

1329
01:49:34,014 --> 01:49:36,050
Let's play rough! Come on. Back off!

1330
01:49:37,014 --> 01:49:41,529
- Roy!
- Keep coming, and I'll break her neck!

1331
01:49:41,733 --> 01:49:44,566
- Come here and talk.
- Fuck you, Marty! I'm walking out!

1332
01:49:50,333 --> 01:49:53,131
No! No! Don't you... !

1333
01:50:00,614 --> 01:50:02,206
You OK?

1334
01:50:28,854 --> 01:50:32,210
Don't even think of lighting
that cigarette, Miss Venable.

1335
01:50:37,374 --> 01:50:39,683
- How's your neck?
- I'll live.

1336
01:50:39,894 --> 01:50:41,452
I could call a doctor.

1337
01:50:42,134 --> 01:50:46,730
Mr Shaughnessy just called
to inform me there will be no mistrial.

1338
01:50:46,934 --> 01:50:49,289
- As if that was his right.
- I can't believe...

1339
01:50:49,494 --> 01:50:51,485
...that scumbag has the balls to call.

1340
01:50:51,694 --> 01:50:53,207
No thanks.

1341
01:50:53,414 --> 01:50:58,648
What matters to me is what you have
to say. Your case has been damaged.

1342
01:50:59,495 --> 01:51:02,055
In fairness to the Prosecution
I would declare a mistrial,

1343
01:51:02,255 --> 01:51:06,328
regardless of what Shaughnessy
and Vail think, if that's what you want.

1344
01:51:06,535 --> 01:51:09,447
The Prosecution doesn't wanna try
this case again even if it could.

1345
01:51:09,655 --> 01:51:12,328
Which it can't. At least not by me.

1346
01:51:12,535 --> 01:51:15,253
I think I can guarantee you
there's no one

1347
01:51:15,454 --> 01:51:20,084
in the DA's office who will.
So...it's up to you.

1348
01:51:20,294 --> 01:51:23,331
I'm gonna dismiss the jury
in favour of a bench trial

1349
01:51:23,534 --> 01:51:27,323
and a blind plea of not guilty
by reason of insanity. Yes?

1350
01:51:27,535 --> 01:51:31,210
The defendant will be remanded
to Elgin for a 30-day evaluation period.

1351
01:51:31,415 --> 01:51:33,371
Let them decide
the term of his commitment.

1352
01:51:33,575 --> 01:51:36,692
- Do you have a problem with that?
- He'll be out in a month.

1353
01:51:36,895 --> 01:51:39,887
Take it up with the Legislature,
Miss Venable.

1354
01:51:42,335 --> 01:51:44,212
I'm going home.

1355
01:51:49,095 --> 01:51:52,485
- Your Honour.
- No, I won't refund your contempt fine.

1356
01:51:52,695 --> 01:51:56,609
Next time you wanna get a client off
on insanity, you plead that way,

1357
01:51:56,816 --> 01:51:58,568
or I'll have you disbarred.

1358
01:52:26,696 --> 01:52:30,814
- You OK?
- Am I OK? Do I seem OK?

1359
01:52:31,016 --> 01:52:34,452
I get attacked by this sick twist,
I've lost the case, I'm out of a job.

1360
01:52:34,656 --> 01:52:41,334
No, I'm not OK. But hey, you won,
justice was done. Who cares, right?

1361
01:52:42,656 --> 01:52:44,374
Congratulations.

1362
01:52:50,335 --> 01:52:51,893
You knew, didn't you?

1363
01:52:52,095 --> 01:52:54,849
You knew if I went after him,
he'd wig out.

1364
01:52:55,056 --> 01:52:58,492
I knew he'd come out
if he was threatened.

1365
01:52:58,696 --> 01:53:02,006
Who better to do that than me?

1366
01:53:02,216 --> 01:53:03,934
You used me.

1367
01:53:07,616 --> 01:53:11,006
Yeah, I did. I had no choice.

1368
01:53:12,216 --> 01:53:15,572
What did I use that was so terrible?

1369
01:53:15,776 --> 01:53:19,451
I knew you'd do your job. I knew
you'd stand up to Shaughnessy.

1370
01:53:19,656 --> 01:53:22,250
I knew you'd try to win the case.
What's wrong with that?

1371
01:53:22,456 --> 01:53:26,894
- I lost my fucking job!
- Good, you should've left years ago.

1372
01:53:27,097 --> 01:53:30,692
- You always say what's right for me.
- I'm arrogant.

1373
01:53:32,417 --> 01:53:33,850
I'm very...

1374
01:53:35,496 --> 01:53:38,056
...very arrogant.

1375
01:53:47,696 --> 01:53:49,812
- You wanna dance?
- No.

1376
01:53:51,096 --> 01:53:53,052
- Sure?
- Yeah.

1377
01:53:55,457 --> 01:53:58,290
All you have to do is turn around.

1378
01:54:03,217 --> 01:54:05,048
No.

1379
01:54:06,137 --> 01:54:07,411
No.

1380
01:54:16,457 --> 01:54:19,415
I have to see my client.

1381
01:55:00,218 --> 01:55:02,937
- I'd like a minute alone with him.
- You sure?

1382
01:55:15,577 --> 01:55:17,090
You OK?

1383
01:55:20,497 --> 01:55:23,409
My head hurts.

1384
01:55:23,617 --> 01:55:26,769
You don't remember
what just happened?

1385
01:55:29,258 --> 01:55:30,771
No?

1386
01:55:30,978 --> 01:55:33,811
I lo-lost time again.

1387
01:55:35,018 --> 01:55:38,169
Well, I got some good news.

1388
01:55:38,378 --> 01:55:40,209
They've agreed to stop the trial.

1389
01:55:40,418 --> 01:55:45,287
They'll be sending you to a hospital...
to get the help you need.

1390
01:55:46,858 --> 01:55:51,807
There's a very good chance
you can get out someday soon.

1391
01:55:54,418 --> 01:55:56,010
Yeah.

1392
01:56:00,138 --> 01:56:02,333
I c-can't believe it.

1393
01:56:02,538 --> 01:56:06,577
- I d-don't know what to say, Mr Vail.
- That's all right.

1394
01:56:06,778 --> 01:56:11,932
I knew the minute you came into my
cell that everýthing would be OK.

1395
01:56:12,138 --> 01:56:15,448
You s-saved my life.

1396
01:56:21,938 --> 01:56:23,974
I got to go.

1397
01:56:25,339 --> 01:56:30,333
- When will I see you again?
- That's up to the courts now.

1398
01:56:31,379 --> 01:56:35,577
I don't want you to worry.
I'm gonna stay on top of this, OK?

1399
01:56:41,819 --> 01:56:44,048
Thank you.

1400
01:56:44,258 --> 01:56:48,217
- Give me a call if you need to.
- I will.

1401
01:56:51,418 --> 01:56:53,329
- Mr Vail?
- Yeah.

1402
01:56:55,258 --> 01:56:59,537
Will you t-tell Miss Venable I'm sorry?

1403
01:57:00,739 --> 01:57:03,537
Tell her I hope her neck is OK.

1404
01:57:04,779 --> 01:57:06,451
Yeah.

1405
01:57:22,179 --> 01:57:25,616
- What did you just say?
- What?

1406
01:57:26,860 --> 01:57:30,249
You told me you don't remember.
You black out.

1407
01:57:33,139 --> 01:57:35,289
So how do you know about her neck?

1408
01:57:50,139 --> 01:57:53,256
Well, good for you, Marty.

1409
01:57:54,939 --> 01:57:56,578
I was gonna let it go.

1410
01:57:56,780 --> 01:57:59,738
You were looking so happy just now.
I was thinking...

1411
01:58:01,260 --> 01:58:03,535
To tell you the truth,
I'm glad you figured it.

1412
01:58:03,740 --> 01:58:06,971
'Cause I have been dying to tell you.

1413
01:58:07,180 --> 01:58:09,569
I just didn't know
who you'd wanna hear it from.

1414
01:58:09,780 --> 01:58:11,736
Aaron or Roy, Roy or Aaron.

1415
01:58:12,500 --> 01:58:18,529
Well, I'll let you in on a client-
attorney-privilege type of secret.

1416
01:58:18,739 --> 01:58:22,891
It don't matter who you hear it from.
It's the same story.

1417
01:58:26,860 --> 01:58:29,738
I j-j-just...

1418
01:58:29,940 --> 01:58:33,296
had to kill Linda, Mr Vail.

1419
01:58:33,500 --> 01:58:36,856
That cunt just got what she deserved.

1420
01:58:39,180 --> 01:58:43,059
But...cutting up
that son of a bitch Rushman...

1421
01:58:44,820 --> 01:58:47,618
...that was just a fucking work of art.

1422
01:58:55,660 --> 01:58:57,777
You're good. You are really good.

1423
01:58:58,781 --> 01:59:02,490
Yeah, I did get caught, though, didn't l?

1424
01:59:05,460 --> 01:59:08,850
So there never...
there never was a Roy?

1425
01:59:10,700 --> 01:59:17,014
Jesus Christ, Marty. If that's what
you think, I'm disappointed in you.

1426
01:59:18,900 --> 01:59:23,496
There never was an Aaron, counsellor.

1427
01:59:31,301 --> 01:59:33,895
Come on, I thought you had it
figured there at the end.

1428
01:59:34,101 --> 01:59:37,173
The way you put me on the stand
like that, that was brilliant.

1429
01:59:37,381 --> 01:59:40,657
The whole "act-like-a-man" thing.
I knew what you wanted.

1430
01:59:40,861 --> 01:59:43,295
It was like we were dancing, Marty!

1431
01:59:43,501 --> 01:59:45,617
- Guard.
- Don't be like that, Marty.

1432
01:59:46,981 --> 01:59:51,929
We did it, man. We fucking did it.
We're a great team, you and me.

1433
01:59:52,140 --> 01:59:54,176
You think I could've
done this without you?

1434
01:59:54,380 --> 01:59:59,330
You're feeling angry because you
started to care about old Aaron, but...

1435
02:00:00,541 --> 02:00:02,418
...love hurts, Marty. What can I say?

1436
02:00:03,501 --> 02:00:06,732
I'mjust kidding, bud!
I didn't mean to hurt your feelings!

1437
02:00:06,941 --> 02:00:09,375
What else was I supposed to do?!

1438
02:00:09,581 --> 02:00:14,257
You'll thank me down the road, 'cause
this'll toughen you up, Martin Vail!

1439
02:00:14,461 --> 02:00:17,897
You hear me? That's a promise!

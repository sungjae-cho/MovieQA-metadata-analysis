00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:57,514
A 1949 Buick Roadmaster convertible. 

182
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,890
Only 8,000 production models made.

183
00:09:59,057 --> 00:10:01,226
Straight-Eight. Fireball Eight.

184
00:10:01,392 --> 00:10:04,854
It was the first full year of the Dynaflow transmission.

185
00:10:06,064 --> 00:10:07,816
Know it by rote.

186
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:26,042
You were his only child.

187
00:10:26,209 --> 00:10:27,669
You came along when he was...

188
00:10:28,545 --> 00:10:31,139
what, 45 or something?

189
00:10:31,506 --> 00:10:33,435
He probably thought he was never going to have a son...

190
00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:36,227
so he had to love you.

191
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:40,431
I think you're exaggerating. You were his child, his son, his blood.

192
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:43,135
In these pictures here,

193
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:44,477
he doesn't look like a man who doesn't love his son.

194
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:47,355
What are you doin' lookin' at this? Put that away.

195
00:10:47,522 --> 00:10:50,066
- You want to hear a story?
- Don't get mad.

196
00:10:50,233 --> 00:10:51,901
You know the convertible in the garage? 

197
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:54,904
- His baby, that and the goddamn roses.
- The Buick.

198
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:56,781
The car was off-limits to me.

199
00:10:56,948 --> 00:10:59,223
"That's a classic," he'd say.

200
00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:00,243
"It's not for children."

201
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:01,935
Tenth grade, I'm 16 years old, and for once...

202
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:05,165
I bring home a report card, and it's almost all A's.

203
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:06,325
I go to my old man,

204
00:11:06,431 --> 00:11:08,084
"Can I take the car out? "

205
00:11:08,251 --> 00:11:11,254
Take the guys out in the Buick, sort of a victory drive.

206
00:11:11,421 --> 00:11:12,515
He says, "No."

207
00:11:13,151 --> 00:11:15,466
I steal the keys, I sneak it out.

208
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:17,594
- You took the car with no permission?
- Yes.

209
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,304
Why? Why then?

210
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:22,223
Because I... I deserved it.

211
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:24,868
Nothing I did was good enough for this guy.

212
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:25,810
Don't you understand that?

213
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:27,615
We're on Columbia Parkway, four kids.

214
00:11:27,735 --> 00:11:29,606
We get pulled over.

215
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:31,107
An accident?

216
00:11:32,275 --> 00:11:33,484
Pulled over.

217
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:36,821
- What is pulled over? Police?
- Yes, police.

218
00:11:36,988 --> 00:11:39,032
Can I finish?

219
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:41,115
He called in a report of a stolen car.

220
00:11:41,228 --> 00:11:42,952
Not "his son took the car...

221
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:45,121
without permission." Just "stolen."

222
00:11:45,288 --> 00:11:46,110
Central Station.

223
00:11:46,228 --> 00:11:47,957
The other guys' dads bail 'em out in an hour.

224
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:49,125
He left me there two days.

225
00:11:49,292 --> 00:11:52,795
- He left you in prison two days?
- Two days.

226
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:56,174
Were you scared?

227
00:11:56,341 --> 00:11:58,134
Yeah, I was scared.

228
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:01,804
Left home. I never saw him again.

229
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:04,557
Charlie, after a year we've been together...

230
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:07,060
this is the first time I've heard this story.

231
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:08,815
It's strange, huh?

232
00:12:09,126 --> 00:12:11,314
I mean, how can you keep all this inside you and... 

233
00:12:11,481 --> 00:12:12,899
not say anything?

234
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:14,010
When I was a kid... 

235
00:12:14,126 --> 00:12:17,187
and I got scared, the Rain Man would come and sing to me.

236
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:21,282
The rain what?

237
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:24,644
You know, one of those imaginary childhood friends.

238
00:12:24,911 --> 00:12:26,539
What happened to him?

239
00:12:26,811 --> 00:12:28,456
Nothin'. I just grew up.

240
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,251
Not so much.

241
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:35,672
"And I remember, too, the day you left home...

242
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:38,602
"so full of bitterness and grandiose ideas.

243
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,802
"So full of yourself.

244
00:12:40,969 --> 00:12:42,210
"And being raised without a mother, the hardness of your heart...

245
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,431
"is understandable as well.

246
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:49,394
"Your refusal to even pretend that you loved or respected me...

247
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,229
"all these I forgive.

248
00:12:51,396 --> 00:12:52,935
"But your failure to write, to telephone,

249
00:12:53,045 --> 00:12:55,191
"to reenter my life in any way...

250
00:12:55,358 --> 00:12:57,277
"has left me without a son.

251
00:12:57,443 --> 00:13:01,447
"I wish you all I ever wanted for you. I wish you the best.

252
00:13:07,078 --> 00:13:08,815
"I hereby bequeath to my son, Charles Sanford Babbitt...

253
00:13:08,988 --> 00:13:10,748


254
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:12,417
"that certain Buick convertible...

255
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:17,380
"the very car that, unfortunately, brought our relationship to an end.

256
00:13:17,547 --> 00:13:21,551
"Also, outright title to my prizewinning hybrid rose bushes.

257
00:13:21,718 --> 00:13:22,715
"May they remind him of the value of excellence...

258
00:13:22,828 --> 00:13:25,972
"and the possibility of perfection.

259
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:30,810
"As for my home and all other property, real and personal these shall be placed in trust...

260
00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:35,773
"in accordance with the terms of that certain instrument executed concurrently herewith."

261
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:37,150
What does that mean?

262
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:38,943
It means that the estate, in excess of $3 million...

263
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:43,364
after expenses and taxes, will go into a trust fund...

264
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:46,617
for a beneficiary to be named... 

265
00:13:46,784 --> 00:13:48,202
in this document.

266
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:51,247
- Who is that?
- I'm afraid I can't tell you that.

267
00:13:51,414 --> 00:13:52,915
Who controls the money? You?

268
00:13:53,034 --> 00:13:54,709
No. He's called a trustee.

269
00:13:54,876 --> 00:13:57,420
What is that? How does that work?

270
00:13:57,587 --> 00:14:00,798
Forgive me, but there's nothing more I can say.

271
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:03,843
I'm sorry, son. I can see that you're disappointed.

272
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:05,715
Why should I be disappointed?

273
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:07,013
I got rose bushes, didn't I?

274
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:08,210
What's his name got...

275
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,099
What'd you call him? The...

276
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:12,018
- Beneficiary.
- Yeah.

277
00:14:12,185 --> 00:14:13,050
He got $3 million,

278
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,237
but he didn't get the rose bushes.

279
00:14:14,354 --> 00:14:16,187
I definitely got the rose bushes.

280
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:18,441
- Charles.
- I mean, those are rose bushes.

281
00:14:18,608 --> 00:14:20,276
- I mean, those are rose bushes.
- There's no need...

282
00:14:20,443 --> 00:14:23,488
To what? To be upset?

283
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:25,656
To be upset?

284
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:27,889
If there is a hell, sir,

285
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:29,502
my father's in it...

286
00:14:29,619 --> 00:14:31,010
and he is looking up right now...

287
00:14:31,129 --> 00:14:33,414
and he is laughing his ass off.

288
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:36,805
Sanford Babbitt. You wanna be that guy's son for five minutes?

289
00:14:36,911 --> 00:14:38,127
Were you listening to that letter?

290
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:42,006
Yes, sir, I was. Were you?

291
00:14:42,173 --> 00:14:44,010
No. Could you repeat it?

292
00:14:44,123 --> 00:14:45,968
'Cause I can't believe my fuckin' ears.

293
00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:54,477
I was looking for you. How did it go?

294
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:57,855
I got what I expected.

295
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:14,372


296
00:15:14,539 --> 00:15:16,332
Susanna, this could take a few minutes.

297
00:15:33,516 --> 00:15:34,767
- Can I help you?
- I think you can.

298
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:38,938
I have a problem with a private trust and...

299
00:15:39,105 --> 00:15:41,649
- That's a terrific suit.
- Thank you.

300
00:15:41,816 --> 00:15:44,193
My father was Sanford Babbitt.

301
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:55,371
Is this Wallbrook?

302
00:15:55,538 --> 00:15:58,708
Excuse me. Is this Wallbrook? Excuse me.

303
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:08,299
Dr. Bruner is still in conference.

304
00:16:08,435 --> 00:16:10,136
Would you like to wait in his office?

305
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:12,472
No, we'll stay here. Thank you.

306
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:30,072
Maybe we're not supposed to be looking around here.

307
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:49,926
Good to have you here. Good luck to all three of you.

308
00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:52,678
Twenty dollars starts you all on an important match.

309
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:56,933
In what 1980 comedy film did Goldie Hawn get away from it all? Lisa?

310
00:16:57,099 --> 00:17:01,229
- "Private Benjamin."
- Excuse me, please. I'd like to watch the TV, please.

311
00:17:03,314 --> 00:17:06,609
For whose grandson was the presidential retreat Camp David named?

312
00:17:06,776 --> 00:17:08,444
- Lisa?
- Eisenhower.

313
00:17:08,611 --> 00:17:11,124
Right, for David Eisenhower. You've got another five.

314
00:17:11,265 --> 00:17:12,823
Ten-dollar lead for Lisa.

315
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:16,786
In days of yore, what would a swashbuckler keep in his sheath?

316
00:17:42,687 --> 00:17:43,555
Whatever this is,

317
00:17:43,666 --> 00:17:45,773
I don't understand the point of secrecy.

318
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:48,818
This patient is an old girlfriend of my father's?

319
00:17:48,985 --> 00:17:50,994
I knew your father since you were two years old.

320
00:17:51,138 --> 00:17:52,655
The year my mother died.

321
00:17:52,822 --> 00:17:54,210
I'm trustee of the fund,

322
00:17:54,322 --> 00:17:56,409
but this hospital receives nothing from that.

323
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:58,494
Maybe that's something we could discuss.

324
00:17:58,661 --> 00:18:00,871
I took on this burden...

325
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:02,832
out of loyalty to your father. My loyalty ends there.

326
00:18:02,999 --> 00:18:05,001
And you think I should feel that loyalty?

327
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:07,545
I think you feel cheated out of your birthright...

328
00:18:07,712 --> 00:18:10,840
by a man who had difficulty showing love.

329
00:18:11,007 --> 00:18:12,620
And I think if I were in your shoes,

330
00:18:12,737 --> 00:18:14,176
I'd probably feel the same.

331
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:17,294
I was hoping that we could talk, that you would explain my father's side...

332
00:18:17,431 --> 00:18:19,015
help me understand the right in what he's done.

333
00:18:19,181 --> 00:18:22,310
Because, failing that, I have responsibilities of my own...

334
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:25,146
and they have to be met, even if that means a fight.

335
00:18:25,313 --> 00:18:28,149
I'm sorry, this is not your car.

336
00:18:28,316 --> 00:18:30,406
Yeah, my dad lets me drive slow on the driveway.

337
00:18:30,711 --> 00:18:31,569
I'm an excellent driver.

338
00:18:31,736 --> 00:18:33,305
Are you sure that you drive this car?

339
00:18:33,413 --> 00:18:35,072
There's only 28 miles on the odometer... 

340
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:37,283
since I drove it a week ago Saturday.

341
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:39,210
Should be more than 28 miles.

342
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:40,786
Look, my boyfriend is coming.

343
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:42,549
Of course, today's Monday.

344
00:18:42,890 --> 00:18:44,410
I always drive the car on Saturday. 

345
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:45,424
Never drive on a Monday.

346
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:48,294
- Who is this guy?
- He jumped into the car.

347
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:49,410
Well, he can jump out.

348
00:18:49,601 --> 00:18:50,763
I'm an excellent driver.

349
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,251
Yeah, that's good. Come on.

350
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:54,634
I don't have time for this shit.

351
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,345
Why'd you let him get in? This is not a toy.

352
00:18:57,511 --> 00:18:58,763
He says he drives this car.

353
00:18:58,929 --> 00:19:01,015
Dad lets me drive every Saturday.

354
00:19:01,182 --> 00:19:04,419
Of course, the seats were originally brown leather. Now they're pitiful red.

355
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:08,165
You know, these seats were brown leather.

356
00:19:09,431 --> 00:19:10,451
You know this car?

357
00:19:10,611 --> 00:19:11,851
I know this car.

358
00:19:15,613 --> 00:19:17,239
- How do you know this car?
- I definitely know this car.

359
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:18,905
It's a 1949 Buick Roadmaster.

360
00:19:19,010 --> 00:19:20,282
Straight-Eight. Fireball Eight.

361
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:22,912
Only 8,095 production models.

362
00:19:23,079 --> 00:19:24,925
Dad lets me drive on the driveway, but not on Monday.

363
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,665
Definitely not on Monday.

364
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:28,584
- Who's your dad?
- Sanford Babbitt.

365
00:19:28,751 --> 00:19:29,927
Who? Sanford Babbitt?

366
00:19:30,044 --> 00:19:33,839
10961 Beechcrest Street, Cincinnati, Ohio.

367
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:35,025
That's my address.

368
00:19:35,136 --> 00:19:36,842
What is it with this guy? Hey!

369
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:39,595
- Who's your mother?
- Eleanor Babbitt.

370
00:19:39,762 --> 00:19:42,556
- Eleanor?
- Died January 5th, 1965.

371
00:19:42,723 --> 00:19:46,268
Who the hell are you? Wait a second. Where are you goin'?

372
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:48,729
Thirteen minutes to Judge Wapner and "The People's Court."

373
00:19:48,896 --> 00:19:51,113
I wanna ask you a question.

374
00:19:51,225 --> 00:19:53,659
What you are witnessing is real. The participants are not actors...

375
00:19:53,776 --> 00:19:55,611
- I'm talkin' to you!
- They're actual litigants.

376
00:19:56,904 --> 00:19:58,906
Bruner, who is this guy?

377
00:19:59,073 --> 00:20:01,200
Raymond is your brother.

378
00:20:02,618 --> 00:20:03,619


379
00:20:03,786 --> 00:20:06,163
My brother? I don't have a brother.

380
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:10,709
...and have your disputes settled here in our forum:

381
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:16,298
"The People's Court." "The People's Court."

382
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:20,886
"The People's Court."

383
00:20:22,138 --> 00:20:26,308
Hello, I'm Doug Llewelyn, and welcome to "The People's Court."

384
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:28,102
- What is he, crazy?
- No.

385
00:20:28,269 --> 00:20:30,646
- Is he retarded?
- Not exactly.

386
00:20:30,813 --> 00:20:32,857
- Not crazy or retarded, but he's here.
- He's an autistic savant.

387
00:20:33,023 --> 00:20:34,942
I don't know what that means.

388
00:20:35,109 --> 00:20:37,361
People like him used to be called "idiot savants."

389
00:20:37,528 --> 00:20:40,448
They have certain deficiencies, certain abilities.

390
00:20:40,614 --> 00:20:42,868
Well, he's retarded.

391
00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:44,118
Autistic. Actually, high-functioning.

392
00:20:44,285 --> 00:20:46,328
What does that mean?

393
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:49,847
It means that there's a disability that impairs the sensory input...

394
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:51,167
and how it's processed.

395
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:53,711
English here. You're talkin' over my head.

396
00:20:53,878 --> 00:20:56,297
Raymond has a problem communicating and learning.

397
00:20:56,464 --> 00:20:59,688
He can't even express himself or probably even...

398
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,844
understand his own emotions in a traditional way.

399
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:06,724
And after that, the dog bit him.

400
00:21:06,891 --> 00:21:08,726
I yelled at my dog.

401
00:21:08,893 --> 00:21:11,270
There are dangers everywhere for Raymond.

402
00:21:11,437 --> 00:21:14,440
Routines, rituals... It's all he has to protect himself.

403
00:21:14,607 --> 00:21:16,776
Rituals. That's a good one.

404
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:20,279
Well, it's the way he acts...

405
00:21:20,446 --> 00:21:23,657
sleeps, eats, uses the bathroom, walks, talks, everything.

406
00:21:23,824 --> 00:21:26,702
Breaking a routine is terrifying.

407
00:21:26,869 --> 00:21:28,020
How long has he been here?

408
00:21:28,155 --> 00:21:29,830
I came here in 1960.

409
00:21:29,997 --> 00:21:32,708
- How old is he?
- He was 18 or 20 then.

410
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:33,876
I have to check the records.

411
00:21:34,043 --> 00:21:35,130
You've been here that long?

412
00:21:35,243 --> 00:21:36,796
That's when I started.

413
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:40,400


414
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:40,716
So that's '65, '75, '85... I was almost three years old.

415
00:21:40,883 --> 00:21:41,715
You knew he had a brother.

416
00:21:41,823 --> 00:21:43,469
You knew I was his brother.

417
00:21:43,836 --> 00:21:45,054
Yes, but what's the point?

418
00:21:45,421 --> 00:21:47,431
What's the fuckin' point?

419
00:21:47,598 --> 00:21:49,391
Why wasn't I told I had a brother?

420
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:54,104
- What would you have done about it?
- I don't know.

421
00:21:56,857 --> 00:21:59,401
Does he know how much money he's been left?

422
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:01,695
No. He doesn't understand the concept of money.

423
00:22:03,614 --> 00:22:06,408
He doesn't understand the concept of money.

424
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:09,053
He's just inherited $3 million...

425
00:22:09,166 --> 00:22:11,413
and he doesn't understand the concept of money?

426
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:16,126
Well, that is fuckin' poetic, don't you think?

427
00:22:18,254 --> 00:22:20,256
Good ol' Dad.

428
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:21,966
What's his name? Yes. Then who's playing first? Yes.

429
00:22:22,132 --> 00:22:23,384
Who? The fellow playing first base for St. Louie.

430
00:22:23,551 --> 00:22:28,639
- Who?
- Why is he doin' that?

431
00:22:28,806 --> 00:22:32,101
Whenever he gets nervous, he does "Who's On First? "

432
00:22:32,268 --> 00:22:34,019
- Yeah, why?
- Why?

433
00:22:34,121 --> 00:22:36,605
It's his way of dealing with you touching his books and stuff.

434
00:22:36,772 --> 00:22:38,855
So he memorized "Who's On First? "

435
00:22:39,012 --> 00:22:40,609
That, among other things.

436
00:22:40,776 --> 00:22:42,528
Raymond, Ted Kloszevski.

437
00:22:42,695 --> 00:22:44,915
Kluszewski. Ted Kluszewski.

438
00:22:45,035 --> 00:22:46,156
"Big Klu." First base.

439
00:22:46,323 --> 00:22:47,915
He played for Cincinnati.

440
00:22:48,023 --> 00:22:50,286
Traded for Dee Fondee, 1957.

441
00:22:50,452 --> 00:22:52,010
Lifetime batting average,

442
00:22:52,112 --> 00:22:53,414
- ... 298.
- He reads all these great books, huh?

443
00:22:53,581 --> 00:22:56,125
Reads and remembers whatever he gets his hands on.

444
00:22:58,627 --> 00:23:03,007
Vern. V-E-R-N. Of course, these people are gonna be here all day, Vern.

445
00:23:03,173 --> 00:23:05,311
This is an unannounced visit, Vern.

446
00:23:05,452 --> 00:23:07,760
This is definitely not a weekend visit.

447
00:23:07,887 --> 00:23:10,014
He's gettin' anxious. It's okay, Ray.

448
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:12,266


449
00:23:12,433 --> 00:23:15,185
This is an unannounced visit, Vern.

450
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:16,770
He said not to touch the books!

451
00:23:16,937 --> 00:23:18,125
Not to touch books.

452
00:23:18,231 --> 00:23:20,316
- You like Shakespeare?
- I don't know.

453
00:23:20,482 --> 00:23:21,820
- Did you read all this?
- I don't know. Vern?

454
00:23:21,890 --> 00:23:23,944
- Did you read "MacBeth"?
- I don't know. Vern?

455
00:23:24,111 --> 00:23:25,988
- Hamlet?
- I don't know.

456
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:27,230
Vern?

457
00:23:26,155 --> 00:23:27,865
- "The Twelfth Night"?
- Stop it!

458
00:23:28,032 --> 00:23:29,366
- Yes.
- Yes?

459
00:23:29,533 --> 00:23:32,494
You read all the stories in this book, 

460
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:34,163
and you don't know if you read the book?

461
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:36,290
- I don't know. V-E-R-N.
- You don't know?

462
00:23:36,457 --> 00:23:39,168
Maybe you'd better put it back.

463
00:23:39,335 --> 00:23:43,631
You don't know. Okay, Ray, take it easy.

464
00:23:43,797 --> 00:23:45,841
I won't touch anything else, Ray.

465
00:23:46,008 --> 00:23:47,615
It's okay, Ray.

466
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:49,011
Come on. My main man.

467
00:23:49,178 --> 00:23:51,110
Vern, my main man. 

468
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:52,348
My main man Vern.

469
00:23:52,514 --> 00:23:54,892
- It's okay, Ray.
- Yeah.

470
00:23:55,059 --> 00:23:55,765
My main man.

471
00:23:55,879 --> 00:23:56,935
Yeah, my main man.

472
00:23:57,102 --> 00:24:00,064
Here are your cards. 

473
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:02,149
I'm sorry. I didn't know where you wanted me to put them.

474
00:24:02,316 --> 00:24:05,819
Are you taking any prescription medication?

475
00:24:08,864 --> 00:24:11,367
That's his way of showing he likes you.

476
00:24:11,533 --> 00:24:13,952
But when I touched him before, he pulled away.

477
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:17,164
Don't take it personal. He never touched me.

478
00:24:17,331 --> 00:24:18,811
I'm closer to him than anybody. 

479
00:24:18,921 --> 00:24:20,959
Known him for nine years. It's not him.

480
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:24,637
If I left town tomorrow and didn't say good-bye,

481
00:24:25,104 --> 00:24:26,340
he'd never notice.

482
00:24:26,507 --> 00:24:28,717
- He wouldn't notice?
- I'm not sure,

483
00:24:28,884 --> 00:24:32,179
but I don't think people are his first priority.

484
00:24:32,346 --> 00:24:36,058
Ray, you wanna go take a walk?

485
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:42,147
Can he hear us when he's like that?

486
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:44,441
You wanna show your brother your ducks?

487
00:24:44,608 --> 00:24:46,902
There's 27 minutes to "Jeopardy."

488
00:24:47,069 --> 00:24:49,613
Don't worry. We'll bring you right back.

489
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:52,424
Practically 26 minutes to "Jeopardy."

490
00:24:52,859 --> 00:24:53,742
We'll bring him right back.

491
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:55,577
Twenty-six minutes.

492
00:24:55,828 --> 00:24:58,080
I won't do it. I won't do it!

493
00:24:58,247 --> 00:25:02,876
First of all because of your tone of voice, this commanding...

494
00:25:03,043 --> 00:25:05,713
You're upset.

495
00:25:05,879 --> 00:25:07,381
Raymond, I'm gonna talk to Susanna alone.

496
00:25:07,548 --> 00:25:09,425
- Bye, Raymond.
- Susanna! Just hold on. Okay?

497
00:25:09,591 --> 00:25:12,886
I'll be right back. No. Just stay there.

498
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:18,390
No, Raymond. Raymond. Raymond! Raymond! Just stay there.

499
00:25:17,099 --> 00:25:18,392
Just stay there. 

500
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:21,979
Just stand still, okay? That's good.

501
00:25:22,146 --> 00:25:23,630
I'll do it if you tell me why. 

502
00:25:23,746 --> 00:25:24,898
Why do I do...

503
00:25:26,775 --> 00:25:29,111
- What?
- Why do I have to take the car and go down there...

504
00:25:29,278 --> 00:25:32,281
and wait for you again at the gate?

505
00:25:32,448 --> 00:25:34,533
Why?

506
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:36,261
It's for Raymond.

507
00:25:36,403 --> 00:25:39,188
The car disturbs him.

508
00:25:39,455 --> 00:25:41,331
- That's why?
- That's why.

509
00:25:42,583 --> 00:25:43,625
Okay, Raymond.

510
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:57,389
What are you lookin' at? The ducks are over here.

511
00:25:57,556 --> 00:25:59,016
I don't know.

512
00:26:02,728 --> 00:26:05,731
Listen, our father died last week.

513
00:26:05,898 --> 00:26:07,983
- Did they tell you?
- I don't know.

514
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:09,220
You don't know if they told you, 

515
00:26:09,330 --> 00:26:11,028
or you don't know what dead is?

516
00:26:12,946 --> 00:26:15,824
That means he's gone. He's at the cemetery.

517
00:26:15,991 --> 00:26:19,161
- You wanna go see him at the cemetery?
- I don't know.

518
00:26:19,328 --> 00:26:21,410
Does that mean maybe you wanna go?

519
00:26:21,528 --> 00:26:22,664
I don't know.

520
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:27,550
I live in Los Angeles.

521
00:26:27,811 --> 00:26:29,346
I thought maybe we could go to Los Angeles... 

522
00:26:29,463 --> 00:26:30,464
and see a Dodgers game.

523
00:26:30,631 --> 00:26:34,927
- Go... go see the Dodgers play.
- Today's an off day.

524
00:26:35,094 --> 00:26:36,110
We don't have to go today.

525
00:26:36,224 --> 00:26:37,513
Monday, no games scheduled.

526
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:39,655
I just thought maybe you'd like to go... 

527
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,975
see Fernando Valenzuela pitch.

528
00:26:42,142 --> 00:26:43,410
Fernando pitched on Saturday. 

529
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:45,020
Not scheduled to pitch 'til Wednesday.

530
00:26:45,187 --> 00:26:46,897
- He's gonna pitch Wednesday?
- Wednesday.

531
00:26:47,606 --> 00:26:50,192
- I'm not doin' anything on Wednesday.
- Yeah, Wednesday.

532
00:26:50,359 --> 00:26:51,652
- Let's go to L.A.
- Yeah.

533
00:26:53,112 --> 00:26:54,488
Come on, Ray.

534
00:26:56,532 --> 00:26:58,575
It's a long way to California...

535
00:26:58,742 --> 00:27:02,037
and I'm definitely not supposed to be off the grounds for more than two hours.

536
00:27:02,204 --> 00:27:04,050
Have to be back in two hours.

537
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,220
Wait till you get there.

538
00:27:05,332 --> 00:27:07,510
The people, crowds cheering. You'll love it.

539
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:09,044
Have to be back in two hours.

540
00:28:48,852 --> 00:28:50,687
This is the presidential suite.

541
00:28:50,854 --> 00:28:52,054
Dinner's at 6:30 p.m.

542
00:28:52,132 --> 00:28:53,482
Here is Raymond's room.

543
00:28:53,649 --> 00:28:55,832
Look at this beautiful room.

544
00:28:55,943 --> 00:28:57,402
This is definitely not my room.

545
00:28:57,569 --> 00:29:00,405
- It's just for tonight.
- Have to go to Wallbrook for dinner.

546
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:03,825
Little guy! This is gonna be terrific. We're brothers.

547
00:29:03,992 --> 00:29:06,370
Dr. Bruner wants us to have fun.

548
00:29:06,536 --> 00:29:07,537
- When did he say...
- Yes.

549
00:29:07,704 --> 00:29:11,583
I don't have my tapioca pudding. We have that for dessert.

550
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:12,695
We can do that. 

551
00:29:12,810 --> 00:29:14,252
I'm gonna call Lenny.

552
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:15,920
This is definitely not my room, 

553
00:29:16,039 --> 00:29:18,006
and I don't have my tapioca pudding.

554
00:29:18,173 --> 00:29:19,562
The bed's in the wrong place.

555
00:29:19,674 --> 00:29:20,467
You can move it.

556
00:29:20,634 --> 00:29:21,735
Where do you want the bed?

557
00:29:21,844 --> 00:29:23,845
Should be near the window.

558
00:29:24,012 --> 00:29:27,975
Of course, I don't have my books. Of course, there's no bookshelves.

559
00:29:28,141 --> 00:29:31,103
I'm definitely out of books. I'm going to be bookless.

560
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:32,220
Here's a book,

561
00:29:32,510 --> 00:29:35,065
a big telephone book. A lot of words.

562
00:29:35,232 --> 00:29:37,109
Pick up, Lenny.

563
00:29:37,276 --> 00:29:39,069
I got $200,000 going to the shithouse,

564
00:29:39,236 --> 00:29:41,613
and he doesn't answer the phone.

565
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:43,573
6:00 here means it's 9:00 there.

566
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:44,572
It's 3:00 there.

567
00:29:44,784 --> 00:29:45,826
6:30 p.m. Is dinner.

568
00:29:45,993 --> 00:29:48,859
It's 3:00 there. He doesn't wanna answer the phone?

569
00:29:48,996 --> 00:29:51,832
Orange soda.

570
00:29:51,999 --> 00:29:53,959
Has to be in a can with a straw.

571
00:29:54,126 --> 00:29:57,324
Bruner told you that you should do this?

572
00:29:57,464 --> 00:29:58,755
It doesn't make sense.

573
00:29:58,922 --> 00:30:00,048
I know what's good for him.

574
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:20,777
Uh-oh! Uh-oh!

575
00:30:21,361 --> 00:30:22,321
V-E-R-N!

576
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:25,824
Oh, God. Go see what he's doin'.

577
00:30:25,991 --> 00:30:29,411
- Ray?
- V-E-R-N!

578
00:30:29,578 --> 00:30:31,747
- What is it?
- What's happening, homes?

579
00:30:31,913 --> 00:30:33,915
- Uh-oh.
- Everything is fine.

580
00:30:34,082 --> 00:30:35,193
Charlie, let's take him home.

581
00:30:35,335 --> 00:30:38,314
He's okay. Just get him some dinner.

582
00:30:38,438 --> 00:30:40,339
Did you say you wanted hamburger?

583
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:42,475
Hamburger, Ray?

584
00:30:42,909 --> 00:30:45,052
We have pepperoni pizza Monday nights.

585
00:30:45,218 --> 00:30:46,276
Pizza?

586
00:30:46,412 --> 00:30:47,896
You get pizza in the institution?

587
00:30:48,013 --> 00:30:49,973
Monday night's Italian night.

588
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:51,915
Law offices of Mitchell and Mitchell.

589
00:30:52,030 --> 00:30:53,435
Get me Stu. It's Charlie Babbitt.

590
00:30:53,602 --> 00:30:55,520
I'm sorry, he's not here.

591
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:58,087
Where is he? I've got a bit of a legal problem.

592
00:30:58,191 --> 00:31:00,192
He's out of town until tomorrow afternoon.

593
00:31:00,358 --> 00:31:02,277
All right, I'll call him tomorrow.

594
00:31:04,946 --> 00:31:07,699
We're not allowed to... 

595
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:09,951
- watch TV during dinner. Definitely not.
- We can watch TV here. 

596
00:31:10,118 --> 00:31:12,204
- We're allowed.
- Yeah.

597
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:18,293
Wheel... of... Fortune!

598
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:21,046
Look at this studio filled with glamorous merchandise...

599
00:31:21,213 --> 00:31:24,132
fabulous and exciting bonus prizes.

600
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:28,637
A pair of cars for today's busy couple.

601
00:31:28,804 --> 00:31:31,765
Thousands of dollars in cash.

602
00:31:31,932 --> 00:31:35,735
Over $150,000... 

603
00:31:35,844 --> 00:31:37,020
just waiting to be won...

604
00:31:37,187 --> 00:31:40,774
as we present our big bonanza of cash...

605
00:31:40,941 --> 00:31:44,736
on "Wheel Of Fortune"!

606
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:47,489
I'd like to order a large pizza.

607
00:31:47,656 --> 00:31:49,157
Pepperoni, right?

608
00:31:49,324 --> 00:31:50,617
I don't want pepperoni.

609
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:53,910
Yeah, a large pepperoni. How long is that gonna take?

610
00:31:54,134 --> 00:31:54,830


611
00:31:54,996 --> 00:31:56,998
Bring some beer up and orange soda.

612
00:31:57,165 --> 00:31:59,751
- You got tapioca pudding?
- No, sir, we don't.

613
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:02,671
Just bring the closest thing.

614
00:32:03,713 --> 00:32:07,467
- Ray, take this. Food is coming shortly.
- Yeah.

615
00:32:07,634 --> 00:32:10,011
- I'll be right back.
- Yeah.

616
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:16,560
Of course, I'm gonna be here for a long time, a very long time.

617
00:32:16,726 --> 00:32:19,896
I'm gone for good, gone for good from my home.

618
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:32,060
- Si! Si!
- Si.

619
00:33:51,529 --> 00:33:55,283
- What is that?
- I think Raymond is in the room.

620
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:57,987
What? Raymond, are you in here?

621
00:33:58,120 --> 00:33:59,037
Charlie Babbitt.

622
00:33:59,204 --> 00:34:02,374
Well, get out! Get out!

623
00:34:02,541 --> 00:34:04,417
- Go!
- Stop it.

624
00:34:04,584 --> 00:34:05,961
Uh-oh.

625
00:34:07,629 --> 00:34:10,298
- Jesus Christ!
- Go in there with him.

626
00:34:10,465 --> 00:34:13,260
- Charlie, go in there.
- Why?

627
00:34:13,426 --> 00:34:16,687
He's afraid. He doesn't understand this.

628
00:34:16,956 --> 00:34:18,098
Go in there.

629
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:26,398
Raymond, what were you doin' in my room? What were you doin' in my room?

630
00:34:26,565 --> 00:34:27,235
I don't know.

631
00:34:27,350 --> 00:34:28,775
You don't know what you were doin'?

632
00:34:28,942 --> 00:34:30,318
Of course, there were noises.

633
00:34:30,485 --> 00:34:34,698
Those noises are none of your business. You understand that?

634
00:34:34,864 --> 00:34:37,242
Stop actin' like an idiot and go to sleep.

635
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:39,661
Did you hear what I said? Go to sleep!

636
00:34:39,828 --> 00:34:40,785
Go to sleep!

637
00:34:40,898 --> 00:34:41,755
It's nine minutes to 11:00.

638
00:34:41,871 --> 00:34:44,666
- Lights out at 11:00.
- Yeah, well, new rules.

639
00:34:58,013 --> 00:34:59,210
You don't listen to me. 

640
00:34:59,323 --> 00:35:00,724
This is...

641
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:03,768
- What are you talkin' about?
- I asked you to apologize.

642
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:05,610
You went there and insulted him again.

643
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:07,897
I'm not his mother. Am I supposed to tuck him in?

644
00:35:08,064 --> 00:35:10,099
Charlie, you're his brother!

645
00:35:10,243 --> 00:35:12,527
They tell you today that you have a brother...

646
00:35:12,694 --> 00:35:15,155
and I don't see in your face one little reaction.

647
00:35:15,322 --> 00:35:17,824
I'm not saying joy, I'm saying something!

648
00:35:17,991 --> 00:35:19,034
You don't know what I'm goin' through.

649
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:22,220
What are you going through? Because I don't know.

650
00:35:22,321 --> 00:35:24,205
You don't tell me anything.

651
00:35:24,372 --> 00:35:27,834
- You just give me lies! Lies, lies!
- What lies?

652
00:35:28,001 --> 00:35:32,339
This thing that Dr. Bruner asked you to bring him here, this is bullshit.

653
00:35:32,505 --> 00:35:34,632
I know it's not true. So tell me, why is he here?

654
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:36,176
- I'm pissed at him.
- At who?

655
00:35:36,343 --> 00:35:38,511
- My father.
- So you bring Raymond here.

656
00:35:38,678 --> 00:35:39,638
Why?

657
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:41,630
'Cause I got him and they want him!

658
00:35:41,744 --> 00:35:42,807
This makes no sense!

659
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:43,911
Raymond was left all the money.

660
00:35:44,024 --> 00:35:44,809


661
00:35:44,976 --> 00:35:45,337
How much?

662
00:35:45,444 --> 00:35:47,646
$3 million. Every penny of it.

663
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:48,336
So?

664
00:35:48,481 --> 00:35:49,856
I'm gonna keep him 'til I get my half!

665
00:35:50,023 --> 00:35:51,608
I deserve that!

666
00:35:53,985 --> 00:35:56,988
What is this, huh? Susanna?

667
00:35:58,365 --> 00:35:59,824
- Just take it easy.
- I've had enough!

668
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:01,868
You've had enough? What does that mean?

669
00:36:02,035 --> 00:36:04,287
- I'm leaving.
- You're leaving me now?

670
00:36:04,454 --> 00:36:07,248
I need you. I need you now!

671
00:36:07,415 --> 00:36:09,114
You need nobody.

672
00:36:09,302 --> 00:36:11,252
What does that mean? What?

673
00:36:11,419 --> 00:36:14,547
Just take it easy! What is my crime here?

674
00:36:14,714 --> 00:36:17,205
Your crime is that you use people!

675
00:36:17,343 --> 00:36:19,469
You're using Raymond, you're using me.

676
00:36:19,636 --> 00:36:23,181
- You use everybody!
- I'm using Raymond? Raymond!

677
00:36:23,348 --> 00:36:24,808
- Raymond, am I using you?
- Yeah.

678
00:36:24,974 --> 00:36:28,144
Shut up! He is answering a question from a half hour ago!

679
00:36:28,311 --> 00:36:29,729
What good is $3 million to him?

680
00:36:29,896 --> 00:36:32,440
That money is only gonna sit there, and I need that money.

681
00:36:32,607 --> 00:36:34,109
You know I do.

682
00:36:34,275 --> 00:36:36,111
You need it, so it's not like stealing!

683
00:36:36,277 --> 00:36:38,571
And then what happens to Raymond?

684
00:36:38,738 --> 00:36:39,785
He'll go back to Wallbrook,

685
00:36:39,896 --> 00:36:42,450
or with the money, I'll put him in a better place.

686
00:36:42,617 --> 00:36:44,661
He is gonna be just the same.

687
00:36:44,828 --> 00:36:45,928
Only you have his money.

688
00:36:46,038 --> 00:36:46,913
His money?

689
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:50,208
That man was my father too. Where's my fuckin' half?

690
00:36:50,375 --> 00:36:51,855
I'm entitled to that money!

691
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:52,961
You kidnapped this man!

692
00:36:53,128 --> 00:36:56,005
I did not take him. I took my half.

693
00:36:56,172 --> 00:36:59,175
- Charlie, you're crazy.
- It runs in the family.

694
00:36:59,342 --> 00:37:02,635
You're soaking wet and you're gonna leave in the middle of the night. 

695
00:37:02,752 --> 00:37:03,680
Wait.

696
00:37:03,847 --> 00:37:06,110
My father stuck it to me all my life. 

697
00:37:06,317 --> 00:37:07,434
What do you want from me?

698
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,894
I want out. Out!

699
00:38:01,529 --> 00:38:03,573
- Stop that.
- Good morning.

700
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:06,534
- Coffee?
- That'd be good.

701
00:38:08,077 --> 00:38:11,873
Dibbs, Sally. 461-0192.

702
00:38:12,524 --> 00:38:14,422
How did you know my phone number?

703
00:38:15,894 --> 00:38:16,813
How'd you know that?

704
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:18,130
You said read the telephone book. 

705
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:21,049
Dibbs, Sally. 461-0192.

706
00:38:21,216 --> 00:38:25,178
He remembers things, little things, sometimes.

707
00:38:25,345 --> 00:38:29,416
Very clever, boys. I'll be right back.

708
00:38:29,682 --> 00:38:32,435
- How'd you do that?
- I don't know.

709
00:38:32,602 --> 00:38:34,229
- Did you memorize the whole book?
- No.

710
00:38:34,395 --> 00:38:35,939


711
00:38:36,105 --> 00:38:37,315
- How far did you get?
- "G". Gottsaken.

712
00:38:37,482 --> 00:38:40,193
"G". Gottsaken, William Marshall.

713
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:43,947
- You memorized to "G"?
- Yeah, "G".

714
00:38:44,113 --> 00:38:47,283
- A, B, C, D, E, F, G?
- Half of "G".

715
00:38:49,661 --> 00:38:51,246
- That's good, Ray.
- Yeah.

716
00:38:51,412 --> 00:38:53,248
- I like that.
- Yeah.

717
00:38:56,584 --> 00:38:59,212
- You hungry?
- Tuesday we have pancakes.

718
00:38:59,379 --> 00:39:01,756
- That sounds good.
- Maple syrup.

719
00:39:01,923 --> 00:39:04,175
- You bet your butt.
- Bet your butt.

720
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:07,762
- Uh-oh. Uh-oh...
- They got pancakes.

721
00:39:09,013 --> 00:39:12,267
- What is this, Ray?
- I don't have my toothpicks.

722
00:39:12,433 --> 00:39:14,819
You don't need toothpicks.

723
00:39:14,954 --> 00:39:16,604
That was okay in the hotel with pizza,

724
00:39:16,771 --> 00:39:17,981
but in a restaurant you use a fork.

725
00:39:18,147 --> 00:39:20,275
- I don't have my toothpicks.
- You don't need toothpicks.

726
00:39:20,441 --> 00:39:24,487
- The pancakes will keep sliding off.
- I don't have my maple syrup either.

727
00:39:24,654 --> 00:39:26,362
I'm gonna be without my maple syrup.

728
00:39:26,499 --> 00:39:28,783
You don't see any pancakes, do you?

729
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:31,035
Of course, maple syrup is not here.

730
00:39:31,202 --> 00:39:33,915
Ray, when we order the pancakes,

731
00:39:34,032 --> 00:39:35,079
they're gonna bring the maple syrup.

732
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:38,084
Maple syrup is supposed to be on the table before the pancakes.

733
00:39:38,251 --> 00:39:39,419
We haven't ordered yet.

734
00:39:39,586 --> 00:39:43,089
Maple syrup after the pancakes is definitely too late.

735
00:39:43,256 --> 00:39:47,176
How is that gonna be too late? We haven't ordered the pancakes yet.

736
00:39:47,343 --> 00:39:48,610
If we're gonna be here all morning...

737
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:51,472
with no maple syrup and no toothpicks...

738
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:55,351
I'm definitely not gonna have my pancakes with...

739
00:39:55,518 --> 00:39:57,604
- Ow!
- Don't make a scene.

740
00:39:57,770 --> 00:40:00,148
Stop actin' like a fuckin' retard.

741
00:40:23,171 --> 00:40:24,339
What are you writing?

742
00:40:25,214 --> 00:40:28,009
What the fuck is this?

743
00:40:28,176 --> 00:40:32,013
"Serious"... "Serious injury list: Charlie Babbitt"?

744
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:35,141
"Serious injury list"? Are you fuckin' kidding me?

745
00:40:35,975 --> 00:40:38,603
Number 18 in 1988.

746
00:40:39,771 --> 00:40:42,565
Squeezed and pulled and hurt my neck in 1988.

747
00:40:42,732 --> 00:40:45,860
"Squeezed and pulled and hurt your neck in 1988"?

748
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:49,880
Dr. Bruner, it's Charlie Babbitt.

749
00:40:50,182 --> 00:40:50,907
Where are you, son?

750
00:40:51,074 --> 00:40:53,785
That's not important. What matters is who I'm with.

751
00:40:53,951 --> 00:40:56,663
You have to bring him back, Mr. Babbitt. Do you understand me?

752
00:40:56,829 --> 00:40:57,978
No problem.

753
00:40:58,124 --> 00:40:59,650
That will be $1.5 million.

754
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:01,042
I'm not greedy. I just want my half.

755
00:41:01,209 --> 00:41:02,692
Don't touch that.

756
00:41:02,962 --> 00:41:04,045
I can't do that, Mr. Babbitt.

757
00:41:04,212 --> 00:41:05,672
You know I can't.

758
00:41:05,838 --> 00:41:08,295
Just bring him back, and bring him back now.

759
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:09,467
He belongs here.

760
00:41:09,634 --> 00:41:10,515
I'm his brother.

761
00:41:10,628 --> 00:41:12,971
It's not like kidnapping here, is it?

762
00:41:13,137 --> 00:41:16,015
He's always been a voluntary patient here, but that's beside the point.

763
00:41:16,182 --> 00:41:21,521
This is where he can get the best care. We're talking about his well-being.

764
00:41:21,688 --> 00:41:23,940
Yeah. Let's just cut through the bullshit, okay?

765
00:41:24,107 --> 00:41:26,234
I am entitled to part of my father's estate.

766
00:41:26,401 --> 00:41:27,565
If you won't cut a deal with me,

767
00:41:27,670 --> 00:41:29,487
I'll fly him back to Los Angeles...

768
00:41:29,654 --> 00:41:31,653
I'll stick him in an institution out there...

769
00:41:31,757 --> 00:41:34,492
and we can have a custody battle over him.

770
00:41:34,659 --> 00:41:36,956
Miss, he needs toothpicks.

771
00:41:37,096 --> 00:41:38,997
Could you get him some? Thank you.

772
00:41:39,163 --> 00:41:41,166
Now, you wanna battle me in the courts?

773
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:44,335
You think about that, Dr. Bruner. Think about that.

774
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:46,432
Or we can cut a deal right now.

775
00:41:46,672 --> 00:41:49,590
I don't think you have any idea of the severity of Raymond's condition.

776
00:41:49,757 --> 00:41:52,005
Toothpicks. He needs toothpicks.

777
00:41:52,144 --> 00:41:54,203
Can we just get him some toothpicks?

778
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:57,432
I cannot make money deals with you.

779
00:41:57,598 --> 00:41:59,851
Then I'll see you in court.

780
00:42:04,439 --> 00:42:06,983
Can I have the check? Sorry about the toothpicks.

781
00:42:07,150 --> 00:42:09,527
82, 82, 82.

782
00:42:09,694 --> 00:42:11,279
82 what, Ray?

783
00:42:11,446 --> 00:42:13,781
- How much is this?
- Toothpicks.

784
00:42:16,117 --> 00:42:17,910
That's more than 82 toothpicks.

785
00:42:18,077 --> 00:42:22,123
- 246 total.
- Keep the change.

786
00:42:24,125 --> 00:42:26,044
How many toothpicks are in there?

787
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:29,505
- 250.
- Pretty close. Let's go, Ray.

788
00:42:29,672 --> 00:42:31,424
246.

789
00:42:33,259 --> 00:42:34,419
There's four left in the box.

790
00:42:36,222 --> 00:42:37,722
I have to get my backpack.

791
00:42:41,392 --> 00:42:43,921
97X……
97X.

792
00:42:44,029 --> 00:42:47,356
The future of rock and roll.

793
00:42:47,523 --> 00:42:50,109
97X……
97X.

794
00:42:50,276 --> 00:42:53,529
The future of rock and roll.

795
00:42:55,198 --> 00:42:58,409
97X……
97X.

796
00:42:58,576 --> 00:43:01,662
The future of rock and roll.

797
00:43:02,747 --> 00:43:05,833
97X……

798
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,960
The future of rock and roll.

799
00:43:08,127 --> 00:43:10,421
Ray. Enough already.

800
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:13,132
- 97X
- Change the channel.
- 97X.

801
00:43:13,299 --> 00:43:16,010
The future of rock and roll.

802
00:43:16,177 --> 00:43:19,722
97X……

803
00:43:19,889 --> 00:43:21,933


804
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:24,420
Lenny, I don't care what you think.

805
00:43:24,530 --> 00:43:25,560
Did they say that?

806
00:43:25,686 --> 00:43:27,870
You're gonna have to be more forceful with them.

807
00:43:27,973 --> 00:43:30,305
Lenny, are you... Lenny, shut up a moment.

808
00:43:30,442 --> 00:43:31,579
I am in serious trouble.

809
00:43:31,696 --> 00:43:34,195
I can't get to these cars. I can't get the money.

810
00:43:34,362 --> 00:43:37,198
Do you understand that?

811
00:43:37,305 --> 00:43:38,610
I'll call the loan officer...

812
00:43:38,150 --> 00:43:40,170


813
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:41,160
tell him we have a little problem.

814
00:43:41,327 --> 00:43:44,539
- Listen, Charlie, let me talk...
- Lenny, just listen to me.

815
00:43:44,705 --> 00:43:46,791
I'll be in LAX in three hours, okay?

816
00:43:46,958 --> 00:43:50,837
Now, remember, the Buick is in A-3, main terminal.

817
00:43:51,003 --> 00:43:54,423
Make sure they pick it up. All right? See you in a few.

818
00:43:59,030 --> 00:44:02,090
Will Dr. Andrew Baker...

819
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:04,860
please pick up a white courtesy phone?

820
00:44:05,143 --> 00:44:07,603
- Dr. Andrew Baker.
- Raymond, let's go.

821
00:44:08,855 --> 00:44:11,649
Ray, let's go. Come on.

822
00:44:13,985 --> 00:44:16,237
- What were you watching?
- I don't know.

823
00:44:16,404 --> 00:44:18,030
- You don't know?
- No.

824
00:44:18,197 --> 00:44:21,325
Final call for flight 1559...

825
00:44:21,492 --> 00:44:24,579
service to Salt Lake City and Los Angeles.

826
00:44:26,247 --> 00:44:29,267
There's an airplane out there.

827
00:44:29,401 --> 00:44:31,252
That's right, and everybody's boarding. Let's go.

828
00:44:31,419 --> 00:44:32,920
Airline travel's very dangerous.

829
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:34,645
Don't be silly. It's the safest travel in the world.

830
00:44:34,755 --> 00:44:36,465
- You'll love this. Trust me.
- Oh, no.

831
00:44:36,632 --> 00:44:39,260
- Now come on.
- No.

832
00:44:39,427 --> 00:44:40,678


833
00:44:40,845 --> 00:44:42,972
We're in an airport. People fly out of airports.

834
00:44:43,139 --> 00:44:44,682
Why do you think we're here?

835
00:44:44,849 --> 00:44:45,747
Flying's very dangerous.

836
00:44:45,884 --> 00:44:47,602
In 1987, there were 30 airline accidents.

837
00:44:47,768 --> 00:44:50,938
211 were fatalities and 230 were definitely passengers.

838
00:44:51,105 --> 00:44:52,607
This plane is very safe. Believe me.

839
00:44:52,773 --> 00:44:53,755
I gotta get to L.A.

840
00:44:53,865 --> 00:44:55,192
I don't have time for this shit.

841
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:58,529
- Oh, I don't know. I don't know.
- You don't know?

842
00:44:58,696 --> 00:45:00,545
- No.
- Is it this airline?

843
00:45:00,656 --> 00:45:01,782
Yeah.

844
00:45:01,949 --> 00:45:06,078
Okay, fine. We can... There's an American plane.

845
00:45:06,245 --> 00:45:07,954
American flight 625...

846
00:45:08,073 --> 00:45:10,499
crashed April 27, 1976.

847
00:45:10,666 --> 00:45:15,129
- We don't have to take American. There's a lot of flights.
- Pick another airline.

848
00:45:15,296 --> 00:45:16,297
Continental. We'll take Continental.

849
00:45:16,464 --> 00:45:19,216
Continental crashed November 15, 1987.

850
00:45:19,383 --> 00:45:23,095
Flight 1713. 28 casualties.

851
00:45:23,262 --> 00:45:25,139
- This is very serious.
- Yeah, very serious.

852
00:45:25,306 --> 00:45:26,935
I have to get to Los Angeles.

853
00:45:27,116 --> 00:45:28,734
So you're gonna get on that plane.

854
00:45:28,851 --> 00:45:29,810
- Do you understand me?
- Yeah.

855
00:45:29,977 --> 00:45:33,189
- You have to get on a plane.
- Yeah.

856
00:45:34,398 --> 00:45:38,894
- Now, there's a Delta. It leaves at midnight.
- Yeah.

857
00:45:39,004 --> 00:45:40,237
How's Delta?

858
00:45:40,404 --> 00:45:43,699
Delta crashed August 2, 1985. Lockheed L-1011.

859
00:45:43,866 --> 00:45:45,785
Dallas-Fort Worth. Terrible wind shear.

860
00:45:45,911 --> 00:45:47,970
- All airlines...
- 135 passengers.

861
00:45:48,113 --> 00:45:50,498
All airlines have crashed at one time or another.

862
00:45:50,665 --> 00:45:52,324
That doesn't mean that they are not safe.

863
00:45:52,451 --> 00:45:53,125
Quantas.

864
00:45:53,292 --> 00:45:54,214
Quantas?

865
00:45:54,319 --> 00:45:56,003
Quantas never crashed.

866
00:45:57,129 --> 00:45:59,215
- Quantas?
- Never crashed.

867
00:46:00,841 --> 00:46:04,081
- Well, that's... that's gonna do me a lot of good.
- Never crashed.

868
00:46:04,193 --> 00:46:06,597
Quantas doesn't fly to L.A. Out of Cincinnati.

869
00:46:06,764 --> 00:46:09,350
- You have got to get to Melbourne...
- Australia.

870
00:46:09,517 --> 00:46:11,392
In order to get the plane that flies to Los Angeles.

871
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:12,278
Do you hear me?

872
00:46:12,395 --> 00:46:14,855
- Canberra's the capital. 16.2 million population.
- Let's go.

873
00:46:15,022 --> 00:46:16,399
Very lovely beaches.

874
00:46:16,565 --> 00:46:19,694
- We're getting on this plane!
- No!

875
00:46:26,909 --> 00:46:29,230
Ray! Ray! Ray!

876
00:46:29,952 --> 00:46:31,956
We're not gonna take the plane. He's okay. He's okay!

877
00:46:32,123 --> 00:46:35,376
We're not gonna take the plane.

878
00:46:35,543 --> 00:46:39,213
Just relax. He was upset.

879
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:41,162
We were gonna take the plane. We're not gonna take it now.

880
00:46:41,263 --> 00:46:42,717
We're not gonna fly, okay?

881
00:46:42,883 --> 00:46:44,719
No flying.

882
00:46:47,471 --> 00:46:50,474
- We're not gonna fly.
- No flying.

883
00:46:50,641 --> 00:46:52,727
- You tire me, Ray.
- Yeah.

884
00:46:52,893 --> 00:46:54,832
We're gonna drive to Los Angeles.

885
00:46:56,011 --> 00:46:57,481
Okay? Come on, Ray.

886
00:46:57,648 --> 00:47:01,027
- Ray? Come on.
- Yeah.

887
00:46:59,410 --> 00:47:01,170
Come here.

888
00:47:01,193 --> 00:47:03,181
- No flying.
- We're not taking the plane.

889
00:47:03,318 --> 00:47:04,447
Just grab the fuckin' bag.

890
00:47:04,613 --> 00:47:05,532
No flying.

891
00:47:07,325 --> 00:47:10,745
- You're killin' me, Ray. I just want you to know.
- No flying.

892
00:47:10,911 --> 00:47:12,124
I gotta be in L.A. In three hours.

893
00:47:12,261 --> 00:47:14,248
It's gonna take me three days.

894
00:47:14,290 --> 00:47:15,780
Come on!

895
00:47:18,669 --> 00:47:21,464
- No flying.
- No flying.

896
00:47:24,008 --> 00:47:26,093
I got "Jeopardy" at 5:00.

897
00:47:26,420 --> 00:47:27,850
I watch "Jeopardy" at 5:00.

898
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:28,637
Don't start with that.

899
00:47:28,804 --> 00:47:30,890
"Jeopardy" at 5:00.

900
00:48:05,174 --> 00:48:06,820
Dispatch, this is 1-0-9.

901
00:48:07,130 --> 00:48:08,094
Go ahead, 1-0-9.

902
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:10,930
Can you get another unit here for point control?

903
00:48:11,097 --> 00:48:13,432
Two more over to you. 10-40.

904
00:48:15,309 --> 00:48:17,144
Let's go!

905
00:48:19,647 --> 00:48:20,815
- Bring some more up.
- What's your E.T.A?

906
00:48:22,274 --> 00:48:23,484
Uh-oh.

907
00:48:24,944 --> 00:48:26,654
Ray?

908
00:48:26,821 --> 00:48:27,822
Get in the car.

909
00:48:27,988 --> 00:48:29,949
There's a lot of danger on this highway.

910
00:48:30,116 --> 00:48:31,872
Get in the car. Are you crazy?

911
00:48:31,974 --> 00:48:34,828
- We'll be outta this in a second.
- Yeah.

912
00:48:34,828 --> 00:48:35,170
That's good.

913
00:48:35,871 --> 00:48:39,737
It's okay. That's right. Yeah. We'll be outta here in a few seconds. That's good.

914
00:48:39,852 --> 00:48:41,669
That's good. That's good.

915
00:48:41,836 --> 00:48:45,005
There's a fatal accident over there.

916
00:48:45,172 --> 00:48:47,380
We don't need your help.

917
00:48:47,495 --> 00:48:48,300
Go back to your car.

918
00:48:49,510 --> 00:48:50,720
Just a minute!

919
00:48:51,887 --> 00:48:54,014


920
00:48:54,348 --> 00:48:55,349
Son of a bitch! Ray?

921
00:48:55,516 --> 00:48:56,809


922
00:48:58,030 --> 00:48:59,190
Excuse... Hey...

923
00:48:59,728 --> 00:49:01,235
- Just wait...
- There's nothing to see here.

924
00:49:01,370 --> 00:49:03,232
- Go back to your car.
- Yes, sir.

925
00:49:03,399 --> 00:49:06,527
- Wrecks make him nervous.
- Get in your car.

926
00:49:06,694 --> 00:49:08,946
Just stay there by the side, okay, Raymond?

927
00:49:09,113 --> 00:49:10,945
- Ray. Just stay there.
- A lot of traffic.

928
00:49:11,079 --> 00:49:13,492
Yeah. Definitely a lot of traffic.

929
00:49:13,659 --> 00:49:16,283
A lot of work for $3 million.

930
00:49:16,385 --> 00:49:18,247
I'd like to leave him on the highway and get outta here.

931
00:49:18,414 --> 00:49:22,001
What? I hear ya! I hear ya!

932
00:49:26,890 --> 00:49:29,260
Memorial Hospital is ready...

933
00:49:27,965 --> 00:49:30,384
Stay in your car!

934
00:49:36,599 --> 00:49:38,205
What's it gonna be, Ray?

935
00:49:38,307 --> 00:49:40,477
This is a very dangerous highway.

936
00:49:40,644 --> 00:49:42,104
How will I get to L. A?

937
00:49:42,271 --> 00:49:44,481
Driving a car on this interstate is very dangerous.

938
00:49:44,648 --> 00:49:47,276
- You wanna get off the highway? Will that make you happy?
- Yeah.

939
00:49:47,443 --> 00:49:48,975
Well, you gotta get in the car...

940
00:49:49,361 --> 00:49:51,050
- in order to get off the highway!
- In 1986,

941
00:49:51,161 --> 00:49:54,492
46,400 male drivers were involved in fatal accidents.

942
00:49:57,244 --> 00:49:59,413
I got a great idea.

943
00:49:59,580 --> 00:50:02,041
You'll stay in front of the car until we get off the exit.

944
00:50:02,208 --> 00:50:03,010
You'll get in,

945
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:05,419
and we'll take the not-so-dangerous road.

946
00:50:05,586 --> 00:50:07,463
- Is that an idea?
- Yeah.

947
00:50:07,630 --> 00:50:09,736
Give me five, Ray. That's a great idea.

948
00:50:09,871 --> 00:50:10,883
Give me five. Yeah.

949
00:50:11,050 --> 00:50:12,676
This guy's a fuckin' fruitcake.

950
00:50:20,935 --> 00:50:22,470
I'm asking you. Who's on first?

951
00:50:22,580 --> 00:50:23,771
That's the man's name.

952
00:50:23,938 --> 00:50:25,250
That's whose name? Yes.

953
00:50:25,360 --> 00:50:26,815
Go ahead and tell me. Who?

954
00:50:26,982 --> 00:50:28,317
The guy on first. Who?

955
00:50:28,484 --> 00:50:30,194
The first baseman. Who is on first.

956
00:50:30,361 --> 00:50:34,949
Whose wife? Yes. After all, the man earns it.

957
00:50:35,115 --> 00:50:35,796
Who does?

958
00:50:35,931 --> 00:50:36,795
Absolutely.

959
00:50:36,932 --> 00:50:39,286
All I'm tryin' to find out is what the guy's name on first base.

960
00:50:39,453 --> 00:50:41,266
No, what is on second base.

961
00:50:41,403 --> 00:50:42,873
I'm not asking you who's on second base?

962
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:45,793
Who's on first? That's what I'm tryin' to find out.

963
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:48,921
- Get in the car!
- Don't change the players. Yeah, get in the car.

964
00:50:49,088 --> 00:50:51,966
Get in the car. Yeah. I have to be in bed by 11:00.

965
00:50:52,132 --> 00:50:54,468
Lights out at 11:00. Have to watch TV.

966
00:51:00,766 --> 00:51:02,884
Now it's almost 19 minutes to 11:00.

967
00:51:03,025 --> 00:51:04,270
We have to be in bed by 11:00. Lights out.

968
00:51:04,436 --> 00:51:05,013
Don't start with that.

969
00:51:05,127 --> 00:51:06,689
We're not flying. We're not on the interstate.

970
00:51:06,855 --> 00:51:09,775
I'm on some shit secondary road. I gotta make up time.

971
00:51:09,942 --> 00:51:11,986
I should've been in Los Angeles this afternoon.

972
00:51:12,152 --> 00:51:13,904
My business needs me. I gotta make up time.

973
00:51:14,171 --> 00:51:17,010
Definitely watch TV, but be in bed by 11:00. 

974
00:51:17,121 --> 00:51:17,700
Lights out.

975
00:51:17,866 --> 00:51:18,864
Forget it.

976
00:51:19,107 --> 00:51:20,995
19 minutes to 11:00.

977
00:51:35,592 --> 00:51:38,804
This is a good one. "We don't go out when it rains."

978
00:51:38,971 --> 00:51:40,514
This is a good one. I hope you appreciate this...

979
00:51:40,681 --> 00:51:42,850
because my business is going down the toilet.

980
00:51:43,017 --> 00:51:44,518
I should be in L.A.

981
00:51:44,685 --> 00:51:48,272
Instead I'm in the Honeymoon Haven Motel in Bumblefuck, Missouri...

982
00:51:48,439 --> 00:51:50,899
because you won't go out when it rains.

983
00:51:51,066 --> 00:51:54,361
It's mystifying. It really is. Fuckin' mystifying.

984
00:51:57,865 --> 00:52:00,451
What is this? Good news, bad news?

985
00:52:00,618 --> 00:52:03,120
We passed D.O.T. But failed E.P.A. Again.

986
00:52:03,287 --> 00:52:05,581
It all ends up the same. I can't get my money.

987
00:52:05,748 --> 00:52:07,120
Well, yes, sir. I'm just stuck in Cincinnati since the funeral.

988
00:52:07,230 --> 00:52:08,917
So many leftover details.

989
00:52:09,084 --> 00:52:10,955
My family is...

990
00:52:11,065 --> 00:52:14,214


991
00:52:12,120 --> 00:52:14,110
needless to say, quite overwhelmed.

992
00:52:14,381 --> 00:52:16,355
Yeah, well, thank you. I appreciate it.

993
00:52:16,665 --> 00:52:20,550
It is a shock, to say the least. Thank you.

994
00:52:20,665 --> 00:52:22,650
Can I get an extension on that loan?

995
00:52:22,765 --> 00:52:25,976
A couple of days would make a big difference.

996
00:52:33,734 --> 00:52:35,819
"We don't go out when it's raining."

997
00:52:40,783 --> 00:52:44,036
What? Speak up, Lenny. I didn't buy that kind of time.

998
00:52:44,203 --> 00:52:46,350
I want you to go down... How much?

999
00:52:46,461 --> 00:52:47,289
It's 12:30.

1000
00:52:47,456 --> 00:52:49,541
- What?
- Lunch is 12:30.

1001
00:52:49,708 --> 00:52:50,709
Hold on. What do you want for lunch?

1002
00:52:50,876 --> 00:52:52,544
- Wednesday's fish sticks.
- Fish sticks?

1003
00:52:52,711 --> 00:52:54,925
Green lime Jell-O for dessert.

1004
00:52:55,035 --> 00:52:56,548
Green lime Jell-O. Want another apple juice?

1005
00:52:56,715 --> 00:52:59,343
I want orange soda. Oh, it's 12:31.

1006
00:52:59,510 --> 00:53:01,553
I gotta go. He's startin' to rock and moan.

1007
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:03,889
- 12:32. Definitely 12:32.
- It's okay. No.

1008
00:53:04,010 --> 00:53:06,000
Give me that gun.

1009
00:53:05,265 --> 00:53:07,559
Where is he?

1010
00:53:07,726 --> 00:53:10,604
- Where is he?
- How did you figure to frame Vargas with it?

1011
00:53:10,910 --> 00:53:13,850
'Frame'? Where is he?

1012
00:53:14,024 --> 00:53:15,943
- There's four fish sticks.
- Huh?

1013
00:53:16,110 --> 00:53:17,653
There's supposed to be eight. There's only four.

1014
00:53:17,820 --> 00:53:20,280
There's eight.

1015
00:53:20,447 --> 00:53:22,449
You take a shower, Ray?

1016
00:53:22,616 --> 00:53:25,869
- Ray, you take a shower, right?
- Yeah.

1017
00:53:26,036 --> 00:53:28,526
It's the same as the rain. You get a little wet.

1018
00:53:28,870 --> 00:53:31,125
What do you say, Ray?

1019
00:53:31,291 --> 00:53:34,461
'Course, the shower's in the bathroom.

1020
00:53:34,628 --> 00:53:36,088
That's the end of that conversation.

1021
00:53:36,255 --> 00:53:40,342
- Go again.
- British Poetry for 200.

1022
00:53:40,509 --> 00:53:41,720
The answer: "Shakespeare wrote over... 

1023
00:53:41,830 --> 00:53:43,971
"150 poems in this 14-line form."

1024
00:53:44,138 --> 00:53:45,431
What is a sonnet?

1025
00:53:45,597 --> 00:53:46,807
- What is a sonnet?
- You got it.

1026
00:53:46,974 --> 00:53:49,810
Double letters for 200.

1027
00:53:49,977 --> 00:53:52,271
The top of that one. "The last word in the Pledge of Allegiance." Mark.

1028
00:53:52,438 --> 00:53:53,939
- What is "stands"?
- No.

1029
00:53:54,106 --> 00:53:57,776
Stu, Stu, Stu.

1030
00:53:57,943 --> 00:54:00,155
Legally, Bruner never established a conservatorship of Raymond?

1031
00:54:01,321 --> 00:54:04,241
He didn't figure anyone would show up to contest his authority.

1032
00:54:04,408 --> 00:54:07,327
If that's the case, I definitely will get custody...

1033
00:54:07,494 --> 00:54:09,621
and the $3 million, right?

1034
00:54:09,788 --> 00:54:14,042
And you set up a date... Yeah, you set up a date for the custody hearing.

1035
00:54:14,209 --> 00:54:16,753
Stu, I want a firm date, and I want it early.

1036
00:54:16,918 --> 00:54:19,182
I found that it wasn't an original record...

1037
00:54:19,287 --> 00:54:21,508
because the original song had two verses...

1038
00:54:21,675 --> 00:54:24,595
She hasn't come in? She hasn't called?

1039
00:54:25,554 --> 00:54:28,182
If you hear from her, tell her to call me at this number.

1040
00:54:40,819 --> 00:54:43,947
The Air Alpha Force, from Nike.

1041
00:54:46,450 --> 00:54:49,745
Look at that. 1957 Studebaker Goldenhawk.

1042
00:54:49,912 --> 00:54:51,267
0 to 60 in under 8 seconds.

1043
00:54:51,386 --> 00:54:53,999
275 supercharged horsepower under that hood.

1044
00:54:54,166 --> 00:54:56,627
- It's beautiful.
- 'Course, I'm an excellent driver.

1045
00:54:56,794 --> 00:54:58,421
- You know how to drive?
- Yeah.

1046
00:54:59,588 --> 00:55:00,793
When did you drive?

1047
00:55:00,929 --> 00:55:02,007
I drove the Buick on the driveway... 

1048
00:55:02,174 --> 00:55:04,518
when my dad came to Wallbrook.

1049
00:55:04,885 --> 00:55:08,472
- Was Dad in the car, Ray?
- Yeah.

1050
00:55:10,891 --> 00:55:14,353
- He let you drive the Buick?
- Yeah, slow on the driveway.

1051
00:55:16,063 --> 00:55:18,065
We'll have to let you drive sometime.

1052
00:55:18,899 --> 00:55:20,442


1053
00:55:20,609 --> 00:55:23,010
You never touch this steering wheel when I'm driving! 

1054
00:55:23,120 --> 00:55:23,904
Do you hear me?

1055
00:55:24,071 --> 00:55:27,115
- Yeah. I don't have my underwear.
- Do you hear me?

1056
00:55:27,282 --> 00:55:29,910
- What?
- I'm definitely not wearing my underwear.

1057
00:55:30,077 --> 00:55:32,110
I gave you a pair of mine this morning.

1058
00:55:32,220 --> 00:55:33,330
They're not my underwear.

1059
00:55:34,665 --> 00:55:36,110
I told you to put 'em on. 

1060
00:55:36,225 --> 00:55:36,842
Where are they?

1061
00:55:36,959 --> 00:55:39,086
They're in the pocket of my jacket.

1062
00:55:39,253 --> 00:55:43,090
- Where?
- Here. These are too tight.

1063
00:55:43,257 --> 00:55:45,968
- I don't want them back.
- Mine are boxer shorts.

1064
00:55:46,134 --> 00:55:46,701
What's the difference?

1065
00:55:46,808 --> 00:55:49,263
- These are Hanes 32.
- Underwear is underwear.

1066
00:55:49,429 --> 00:55:52,599
My boxer shorts have my name. It says "Raymond".

1067
00:55:52,766 --> 00:55:54,893
All right. When we pass a store, we'll pick up some boxer shorts.

1068
00:55:55,060 --> 00:55:55,710
I get my boxer shorts at... 

1069
00:55:55,820 --> 00:55:57,813
Kmart in Cincinnati.

1070
00:55:57,980 --> 00:55:59,982
We're not going back. Don't start with that.

1071
00:56:00,148 --> 00:56:01,120
400 Oak Street.

1072
00:56:01,238 --> 00:56:04,249
We're not going back. You don't have to go to Cincinnati for boxer shorts.

1073
00:56:04,392 --> 00:56:06,883
- Oak and Burnett in Cincinnati.
- What did I say?

1074
00:56:06,996 --> 00:56:07,610
It's Kmart.

1075
00:56:07,720 --> 00:56:09,658
I know you hear me.

1076
00:56:09,797 --> 00:56:12,452
- My boxer shorts have...
- You don't fool me.

1077
00:56:12,619 --> 00:56:13,364
Yours are too tight.

1078
00:56:13,478 --> 00:56:16,290
Did you fuckin' hear what I said?

1079
00:56:16,456 --> 00:56:18,876
- Shut up!
- Okay.

1080
00:56:21,044 --> 00:56:22,977
Cincinnati's a long way off.

1081
00:56:23,111 --> 00:56:25,924
You're getting further away from Kmart.

1082
00:56:26,091 --> 00:56:28,719
You don't have to go to Cincinnati to get underwear at Kmart.

1083
00:56:28,885 --> 00:56:30,817
You have to go to Kmart, 400 Oak Street.

1084
00:56:30,919 --> 00:56:32,806
We are not going to Cincinnati, and that's final.

1085
00:56:32,973 --> 00:56:34,410
Get my boxer shorts at Kmart.

1086
00:56:34,523 --> 00:56:35,955
That is final. Did you hear me?

1087
00:56:36,065 --> 00:56:37,519
I don't have my underwear.

1088
00:56:43,233 --> 00:56:45,819
I'm goin' out of my mind!

1089
00:56:45,986 --> 00:56:50,490
What difference does it make where you buy underwear?

1090
00:56:50,657 --> 00:56:53,952
What difference does it make? Underwear is underwear!

1091
00:56:54,119 --> 00:56:56,010
It is underwear wherever you buy it, 

1092
00:56:56,120 --> 00:56:57,914
in Cincinnati or wherever!

1093
00:56:58,081 --> 00:57:01,627
- Kmart.
- You know what I think?

1094
00:57:01,793 --> 00:57:04,004
I think this autism is a bunch of shit.

1095
00:57:04,171 --> 00:57:07,174
You can't tell me that you're not in there somewhere.

1096
00:57:07,341 --> 00:57:11,261
Boxer shorts. Boxer shorts. Kmart.

1097
00:57:12,512 --> 00:57:15,057
These are... These are Hanes 32.

1098
00:57:15,223 --> 00:57:17,809
- Driving me crazy.
- Mine are boxer shorts.

1099
00:57:17,976 --> 00:57:20,354
We have to make a little stop, find a psychiatrist...

1100
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:23,357
'cause you're driving me crazy.

1101
00:57:23,523 --> 00:57:26,735
- Oak and Burnett. We have to buy them at Kmart, Oak and Burnett...
- You are driving me...

1102
00:57:28,862 --> 00:57:30,864
back in... You put your shorts on the highway.

1103
00:57:30,947 --> 00:57:32,866
We have to go back to Cincinnati and Kmart.

1104
00:57:59,977 --> 00:58:02,521
Good luck finding a shrink in this town.

1105
00:58:33,719 --> 00:58:35,554
Raymond?

1106
00:58:44,146 --> 00:58:45,522


1107
00:58:57,284 --> 00:58:59,161


1108
00:59:17,637 --> 00:59:20,057
Hey, you. Dipshit, move it!

1109
00:59:24,019 --> 00:59:25,771
If you ain't gonna move, I'll move you.

1110
00:59:25,937 --> 00:59:27,856
Hey, buddy.

1111
00:59:28,023 --> 00:59:30,650
You'll get run over.

1112
00:59:30,817 --> 00:59:31,731
You're gonna get hurt.

1113
00:59:31,866 --> 00:59:33,487
Do you hear me?

1114
00:59:33,653 --> 00:59:34,780
It said, "Don't walk."

1115
00:59:34,946 --> 00:59:38,116
- Move it.
- Hey, it's all right, sir.

1116
00:59:38,283 --> 00:59:40,285
I'm sorry. Raymond?

1117
00:59:40,452 --> 00:59:41,620
- Yeah.
- Come on.

1118
00:59:41,787 --> 00:59:44,498
- It's all right.
- Gotta get to Kmart.

1119
00:59:44,664 --> 00:59:46,833
Raymond, come on.

1120
00:59:46,340 --> 00:59:48,310
Kmart, 400 Oak Street.

1121
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:48,877


1122
00:59:49,044 --> 00:59:50,796
- It said, "Don't walk."
- Yes, it's broken.

1123
00:59:50,962 --> 00:59:52,172
It said, "Don't walk."

1124
00:59:54,091 --> 00:59:57,324
- This way.
- Have to get to Kmart.

1125
00:59:55,890 --> 00:59:58,320
400 Oak and Burnett.

1126
00:59:58,224 --> 00:59:59,187


1127
01:00:02,390 --> 01:00:04,726
He said, 'Young man, go west'...

1128
01:00:04,893 --> 01:00:09,356
and this is the way our country developed from the East Coast to the West Coast.

1129
01:00:09,523 --> 01:00:12,609
During that period of time...

1130
01:00:13,360 --> 01:00:16,279
there was initiated...

1131
01:00:16,446 --> 01:00:18,782
what was known as the Pony Express.

1132
01:00:18,949 --> 01:00:22,869
I'm sure you have read something about it in the history of the United States.

1133
01:00:23,036 --> 01:00:25,872
I may not have the days or the years exactly right...

1134
01:00:26,039 --> 01:00:30,210
but I'm more or less familiar with the history of the United States.

1135
01:00:30,425 --> 01:00:33,547
- I love to tell the story...
- He's "artistic"?

1136
01:00:33,713 --> 01:00:34,988
No, he's autistic.

1137
01:00:35,129 --> 01:00:37,968
I'm not familiar with that.

1138
01:00:38,135 --> 01:00:39,970
What is the exact nature of the problem?

1139
01:00:39,970 --> 01:00:41,260
...in St. Joe's, Missouri...

1140
01:00:41,555 --> 01:00:43,932
He lives in a world of his own.

1141
01:00:44,099 --> 01:00:47,644
I'm sorry, but what's wrong with him?

1142
01:00:47,811 --> 01:00:52,691
Raymond, do "What's On First?" for her.

1143
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:50,610
It was a problem gettin' mail from the East Coast...

1144
01:00:52,858 --> 01:00:55,318
Who's on first. What's on second.

1145
01:00:57,385 --> 01:01:01,253
They set up an initial program...

1146
01:01:01,389 --> 01:01:03,357
where the Pony Express...

1147
01:01:03,658 --> 01:01:07,424
would ride for approximately 20 miles...

1148
01:01:09,695 --> 01:01:10,689
What am I supposed to do?

1149
01:01:10,818 --> 01:01:13,295
There's gotta be something that I can do here.

1150
01:01:13,461 --> 01:01:15,255
Well, I'm not a psychiatrist...

1151
01:01:15,422 --> 01:01:17,965
but I do know his brain doesn't work like other people.

1152
01:01:18,072 --> 01:01:20,135
What he does isn't intended to be annoying.

1153
01:01:20,302 --> 01:01:23,096
If he's gettin' on your nerves, take a break.

1154
01:01:23,263 --> 01:01:24,648
Spend time away from him.

1155
01:01:24,764 --> 01:01:26,349
I'll just send him back.

1156
01:01:26,516 --> 01:01:29,102
- Sorry?
- Nothing. Inside joke.

1157
01:01:29,269 --> 01:01:31,104
You're telling me I just have to deal with this? I just gotta deal with it.

1158
01:01:31,271 --> 01:01:35,901
Yeah, that's about it.

1159
01:01:36,776 --> 01:01:39,863
Out of curiosity, does he have any special abilities?

1160
01:01:42,407 --> 01:01:45,452
Well, he's got a pretty good memory. He counts toothpicks.

1161
01:01:45,619 --> 01:01:47,787
They spilled a box of toothpicks on the floor...

1162
01:01:47,954 --> 01:01:50,770
and he took one look and knew exactly how many there were.

1163
01:01:50,872 --> 01:01:52,959
He counted 'em in seconds.

1164
01:01:53,126 --> 01:01:55,587
- Raymond.
- Yeah.

1165
01:01:55,754 --> 01:01:59,466
- Are you good with numbers?
- Yeah.

1166
01:01:59,633 --> 01:02:01,301
I read about this. I wanna try somethin' here.

1167
01:02:01,468 --> 01:02:02,916
Kmart, 400 Oak Street.

1168
01:02:03,050 --> 01:02:05,013
What'd I tell you? After this.

1169
01:02:05,180 --> 01:02:07,557
- Ray, can we try somethin'?
- Yeah.

1170
01:02:07,724 --> 01:02:13,605
Do you know how much 312... times 123 is?

1171
01:02:13,805 --> 01:02:15,250
38,376.

1172
01:02:15,732 --> 01:02:18,276
- He's right.
- What?

1173
01:02:18,443 --> 01:02:19,736
- He's right.
- He's right?

1174
01:02:19,903 --> 01:02:27,702
Yeah. Ray. How much is 4,343... times 1,234?

1175
01:02:27,869 --> 01:02:29,871
5,359,262.

1176
01:02:30,038 --> 01:02:32,666
- He's a genius.
- That's right.

1177
01:02:32,832 --> 01:02:33,833
He's a genius.

1178
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:39,297
Ray. Do you know how much the square root of 2,130 is?

1179
01:02:39,464 --> 01:02:43,802
46.15192304.

1180
01:02:43,969 --> 01:02:46,721
- 2304
- 2304.
- That's amazing.

1181
01:02:46,888 --> 01:02:50,392
That is amazing. He should work for NASA or something.

1182
01:02:52,310 --> 01:02:53,395
If you had a dollar, and you spent 50 cents...

1183
01:02:54,061 --> 01:02:58,024
how much money would you have left?

1184
01:03:01,778 --> 01:03:03,196
About 70.

1185
01:03:03,363 --> 01:03:05,156
- Seventy cents?
- Seventy cents.

1186
01:03:05,323 --> 01:03:06,408
So much for NASA.

1187
01:03:06,574 --> 01:03:07,904
We should go to Kmart.

1188
01:03:08,049 --> 01:03:09,327
After this, Ray.

1189
01:03:09,494 --> 01:03:11,538
400 Oak Street.

1190
01:03:11,705 --> 01:03:13,581
Do you know how much a candy bar costs?

1191
01:03:13,748 --> 01:03:16,960
- About $100.
- $100, huh?

1192
01:03:17,127 --> 01:03:19,671
You know how much one of those new compact cars costs?

1193
01:03:19,838 --> 01:03:21,715
About $100.

1194
01:03:22,799 --> 01:03:24,825
In his case, he's pretty well off.

1195
01:03:24,935 --> 01:03:26,386
He's very high-functioning.

1196
01:03:26,553 --> 01:03:28,210
Most autistics can't speak...

1197
01:03:28,320 --> 01:03:30,107
or communicate.

1198
01:03:30,930 --> 01:03:32,430
- Ray!
- Yeah.

1199
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:35,103
- Do you know what "autistic" is?
- Yeah.

1200
01:03:35,270 --> 01:03:37,230
- You know that word?
- Yeah.

1201
01:03:38,898 --> 01:03:40,900
Are you autistic?

1202
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:44,696
I don't think so.

1203
01:03:44,863 --> 01:03:47,824
No. Definitely not.

1204
01:03:52,203 --> 01:03:53,288
...problem with the Lamborghinis.

1205
01:03:53,455 --> 01:03:55,665
Lenny, shut up. Let me see if I understand this.

1206
01:03:55,832 --> 01:03:56,410
Very small here.

1207
01:03:56,520 --> 01:03:59,461
It's gonna cost me $10,000 additional for each car.

1208
01:03:59,627 --> 01:04:03,631
- It's very crowded in here.
- Ray, please, just one second, okay?

1209
01:04:03,798 --> 01:04:04,966
What?

1210
01:04:05,133 --> 01:04:09,596
They wanna take out the manifold and the carburetors in order to put in a fuel injection system now?

1211
01:04:09,763 --> 01:04:11,306
That is nonsense.

1212
01:04:11,473 --> 01:04:13,141
- What are you doing?
- Too crowded in here for a backpack.

1213
01:04:13,308 --> 01:04:15,268
Just leave this on.

1214
01:04:15,435 --> 01:04:19,314
It's gonna cost me $40,000 just to meet E.P.A. Now.

1215
01:04:18,150 --> 01:04:19,810
What? No.

1216
01:04:19,481 --> 01:04:22,800
You give me the number. 

1217
01:04:22,920 --> 01:04:23,868
I'll call the conversion shop myself.

1218
01:04:23,985 --> 01:04:25,779
That's my pen. That's definitely my book.

1219
01:04:25,945 --> 01:04:28,281
Taking your book is not a serious injury.

1220
01:04:28,448 --> 01:04:30,259
For serious injury, look at the red book. That book is blue.

1221
01:04:30,364 --> 01:04:32,494
Forgive me. I've lost my secret decoder ring. 4-5-4-5.

1222
01:04:32,660 --> 01:04:34,788
You're already number 18.

1223
01:04:34,954 --> 01:04:35,864
Got it. 1988, I know.

1224
01:04:35,970 --> 01:04:37,040
It's my book.

1225
01:04:37,207 --> 01:04:39,167
That's my pen.

1226
01:04:39,334 --> 01:04:40,440
12 minutes to Wapner.

1227
01:04:40,574 --> 01:04:42,253
It's definitely very small in here.

1228
01:04:42,420 --> 01:04:44,650
Small... and safe.

1229
01:04:44,760 --> 01:04:46,842
You don't wanna miss the party.

1230
01:04:46,948 --> 01:04:49,427
Do you know that? There's a party in your honor, Ray.

1231
01:04:49,594 --> 01:04:51,815
When we get to L.A.,

1232
01:04:51,925 --> 01:04:53,189
a custody hearing. My lawyer's setting it up.

1233
01:04:53,306 --> 01:04:54,820
You know why there's a party for you? 

1234
01:04:54,930 --> 01:04:56,519
'Cause you're the 3-million-dollar man.

1235
01:04:56,020 --> 01:04:57,880
"What you are witnessing is real."

1236
01:04:57,685 --> 01:04:59,890
- The participants are not actors.
- Ken Aldorf. Charlie Babbitt.

1237
01:05:00,027 --> 01:05:00,772
Fart.

1238
01:05:00,939 --> 01:05:02,222


1239
01:05:02,363 --> 01:05:04,109
- Yeah, I'll hold.
- Fart.

1240
01:05:04,275 --> 01:05:05,485
- Did you fart?
- Fart.

1241
01:05:05,652 --> 01:05:07,487
- Did you fuckin' fart?
- Fart.

1242
01:05:07,654 --> 01:05:09,280
Oh, man. Get the smell out.

1243
01:05:11,157 --> 01:05:14,369
- How can you stand that?
- I don't mind it.

1244
01:05:14,536 --> 01:05:15,537
- Ken Aldorf.
- Ken?

1245
01:05:15,703 --> 01:05:16,860
Ten minutes to Wapner.

1246
01:05:16,970 --> 01:05:17,664
How are you? This is Charlie Babbitt.

1247
01:05:17,831 --> 01:05:20,667
We're definitely locked in this box with no TV.

1248
01:05:20,834 --> 01:05:22,307
I just heard about this $10,000 charge for every car.

1249
01:05:22,416 --> 01:05:23,753
- They're definitely gonna start...
- How can this be?

1250
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:27,006
"People's Court" starts on the...

1251
01:05:27,173 --> 01:05:29,175
You're telling me another $40,000.

1252
01:05:29,342 --> 01:05:31,970
They start on the button. They definitely start on the button.

1253
01:05:32,137 --> 01:05:34,347
I've got a problem. I'll call you from my next stop.

1254
01:05:34,514 --> 01:05:36,349
We're not gonna make it to the program.

1255
01:05:36,516 --> 01:05:38,143
- Definitely have to go now.
- Yes, we're going, Ray.

1256
01:05:37,260 --> 01:05:39,890


1257
01:05:39,853 --> 01:05:42,605
- Just take it easy.
- Eight minutes to Wapner.

1258
01:05:42,856 --> 01:05:44,440
Where am I gonna find a television around here?

1259
01:05:44,607 --> 01:05:47,861
- Eight minutes to Wapner.
- We got eight minutes to Wapner.

1260
01:06:04,711 --> 01:06:07,714
Come on. Come on.

1261
01:06:07,881 --> 01:06:09,363
You wanna get in there and see the show?

1262
01:06:10,630 --> 01:06:13,011
Wanna get in and see the show? Listen up.

1263
01:06:13,261 --> 01:06:16,389
There's not another farmhouse in sight. This is it.

1264
01:06:19,100 --> 01:06:20,550
You act weird, we don't get in. You listening to me?

1265
01:06:20,710 --> 01:06:21,436


1266
01:06:21,340 --> 01:06:23,200
- Yeah.
- I want you to look normal.

1267
01:06:22,103 --> 01:06:25,231


1268
01:06:23,340 --> 01:06:25,270
As normal as possible, all right?

1269
01:06:25,398 --> 01:06:28,151
Just put your hands down. Don't rock and moan.

1270
01:06:28,318 --> 01:06:31,779
- Four minutes to Wapner.
- Just shut up and stand there.

1271
01:06:30,310 --> 01:06:33,250
- Yeah. Uh...
- Don't rock and moan.

1272
01:06:31,946 --> 01:06:35,492


1273
01:06:33,350 --> 01:06:34,940
Put your hands down.

1274
01:06:38,290 --> 01:06:42,190
Good afternoon, ma'am. I'm Donald Clemons from the A.C. Nielsen Company.

1275
01:06:38,828 --> 01:06:40,210


1276
01:06:40,320 --> 01:06:42,098


1277
01:06:42,665 --> 01:06:43,925
- You're familiar with our work?
- You mean the TV ratings?

1278
01:06:44,101 --> 01:06:46,502


1279
01:06:45,930 --> 01:06:48,830
Yes, ma'am. You've been selected as a preliminary candidate...

1280
01:06:46,612 --> 01:06:48,860


1281
01:06:48,970 --> 01:06:52,300
to become our next Nielsen family in the tri-county area.

1282
01:06:52,467 --> 01:06:55,386
- My husband's not home.
- If selected, you'll help shape...

1283
01:06:55,553 --> 01:06:59,182
television programming viewed by our entire nation...

1284
01:06:59,349 --> 01:07:00,980
in return for which you'll receive a check...

1285
01:07:01,115 --> 01:07:04,020
in the amount of $286 each month.

1286
01:07:04,187 --> 01:07:05,852
Who's he?

1287
01:07:05,953 --> 01:07:08,775
That would be my partner, Mr. Bainbridge, who does sample...

1288
01:07:08,942 --> 01:07:10,944


1289
01:07:12,612 --> 01:07:14,072


1290
01:07:13,220 --> 01:07:16,120
- That's it.
- Oh, boy.

1291
01:07:14,239 --> 01:07:17,617


1292
01:07:16,230 --> 01:07:17,390
You'll miss your program.

1293
01:07:18,034 --> 01:07:21,680
- It's finished.
- One minute to Wapner.

1294
01:07:20,130 --> 01:07:21,890
One minute to Wapner.

1295
01:07:21,871 --> 01:07:24,332
I had you in there, Ray!

1296
01:07:25,708 --> 01:07:27,752
Defendants! Plaintiffs! You had it all!

1297
01:07:27,919 --> 01:07:30,611
They're in there making legal history, Ray.

1298
01:07:30,878 --> 01:07:32,882
- Legal history.
- Oh, boy!

1299
01:07:33,049 --> 01:07:35,301
- Oh, boy.
- What is going on out here?

1300
01:07:35,468 --> 01:07:36,505
I'm sorry, ma'am. I lied to you. That man is my brother.

1301
01:07:36,615 --> 01:07:37,196


1302
01:07:37,303 --> 01:07:39,889


1303
01:07:40,056 --> 01:07:41,745
If he doesn't watch "People's Court" in about 30 seconds...

1304
01:07:41,856 --> 01:07:44,060
he'll have a fit on your porch.

1305
01:07:44,227 --> 01:07:45,235
Now, you can help me, or you can stand there and watch it happen.

1306
01:07:45,365 --> 01:07:47,614


1307
01:07:48,481 --> 01:07:51,734
We like to watch cartoons. You think he'd settle for that?

1308
01:07:51,360 --> 01:07:54,890
...and she sees an identical twin.

1309
01:07:51,901 --> 01:07:55,280


1310
01:07:55,446 --> 01:07:58,449
True, he didn't have his shirt on... the other one did...

1311
01:07:58,616 --> 01:08:00,410
but they sure look alike to me.

1312
01:08:00,577 --> 01:08:04,330
If it got on his chest, even if it didn't burn or got real cold...

1313
01:08:04,497 --> 01:08:07,250
- I put my hand on the dry ice.
- Daddy's not here now.

1314
01:08:07,417 --> 01:08:10,461
I wanted to take it off quickly because it got very cold.

1315
01:08:11,250 --> 01:08:14,150
I also confess, I was afraid I might burn my hand.

1316
01:08:14,250 --> 01:08:15,967
If I put it up against a bare chest...

1317
01:08:15,967 --> 01:08:18,515
Ken, work with me. I'll take care of you...

1318
01:08:18,625 --> 01:08:19,704


1319
01:08:21,848 --> 01:08:23,808
- You know that song?
- My judgment is for the defendant.

1320
01:08:23,975 --> 01:08:25,810


1321
01:08:25,977 --> 01:08:28,354


1322
01:08:28,521 --> 01:08:30,961
We'll be back for the reaction...

1323
01:08:31,105 --> 01:08:34,360
to Judge Wapner's decision right after these messages.

01:10:04,890 --> 01:10:07,800
- Definitely gonna be a long journey.
- Just a couple of more days.

1347
01:10:07,900 --> 01:10:10,830
You know the fella's name? Then who's playing first?

1348
01:10:10,930 --> 01:10:13,870
- The fella playing first for St. Louie?
- You gonna start with this again?

1349
01:10:13,970 --> 01:10:16,840
It's just another motel. You gotta do this every time?

1350
01:10:15,086 --> 01:10:16,841


1351
01:10:16,944 --> 01:10:19,090
That's the man's name. That's whose name.

1352
01:10:19,257 --> 01:10:20,216
What are you asking me for? I'm not asking you. I'm telling you.

1353
01:10:20,383 --> 01:10:22,885


1354
01:10:21,780 --> 01:10:24,910
Who is on first. I'm asking you, who's on first?

1355
01:10:23,333 --> 01:10:24,910


1356
01:10:25,019 --> 01:10:26,973
- Yo, Ray.
- That's the man's name.

1357
01:10:27,140 --> 01:10:30,114
- This is not a riddle.
- Yeah. Know the fella's name?

1358
01:10:30,257 --> 01:10:31,705
- Yeah. Then who's playing first base?
- You'll never figure out who's on first.

1359
01:10:31,811 --> 01:10:35,606


1360
01:10:33,390 --> 01:10:37,120
Who is on first. That's the joke. It's comedy.

1361
01:10:35,773 --> 01:10:37,483


1362
01:10:37,650 --> 01:10:40,236
Sometimes his wife comes down and collects it.

1363
01:10:39,300 --> 01:10:40,390
- Whose wife?
- It's comedy.

1364
01:10:40,403 --> 01:10:42,488
Every dollar of it. Yeah.

1365
01:10:42,655 --> 01:10:44,835
You got a first baseman on first? Yeah.

1366
01:10:44,972 --> 01:10:46,815
It's a routine between Abbott and Costello.

1367
01:10:46,926 --> 01:10:48,120
When you do it, you're not funny. You're Abbott and Abbott.

1368
01:10:48,230 --> 01:10:51,762


1369
01:10:50,040 --> 01:10:51,270
- Yeah.
- You understand me?

1370
01:10:51,370 --> 01:10:53,770
Sometimes his wife comes down and collects it.

1371
01:10:51,889 --> 01:10:54,110


1372
01:10:54,220 --> 01:10:55,251
Whose wife? Yeah.

1373
01:10:55,418 --> 01:10:57,170
- Ray?
- Yeah.

1374
01:10:57,336 --> 01:11:00,506
- You are never gonna solve it.
- Yeah.

1375
01:10:59,280 --> 01:11:01,980
You know why? It's not a riddle.

1376
01:11:00,673 --> 01:11:02,508


1377
01:11:02,080 --> 01:11:03,980
And if you understood that...

1378
01:11:02,675 --> 01:11:05,470


1379
01:11:04,090 --> 01:11:07,280
if you understood that it's funny, you might get better.

1380
01:11:05,636 --> 01:11:07,597


1381
01:11:07,763 --> 01:11:10,224
All I'm trying to find out is what's the guy's name on first base.

1382
01:11:10,391 --> 01:11:14,228
What's the guy's name on first base? No, what's the guy's name on second base.

1383
01:11:14,395 --> 01:11:16,189
Have you got a first baseman on first? Yeah.

1384
01:11:16,355 --> 01:11:18,524
Then who's playing first? Yeah.

1385
01:11:18,691 --> 01:11:21,819


1386
01:11:19,240 --> 01:11:21,640
You know the fella's name? Yeah.

1387
01:11:21,986 --> 01:11:23,639
Then who's playing first? Yeah.

1388
01:11:23,911 --> 01:11:25,198
The fella playing first for St. Louie. Who.

1389
01:11:25,364 --> 01:11:28,701


1390
01:11:25,910 --> 01:11:27,840
The guy on first. Who. The first baseman.

1391
01:11:27,940 --> 01:11:29,640
Who is on first. What are you asking me for?

1392
01:11:28,868 --> 01:11:32,205


1393
01:11:29,910 --> 01:11:31,970
Have you got a first baseman on first? Yeah.

1394
01:11:32,371 --> 01:11:34,019
All right, Ray. Come on.

1395
01:11:34,121 --> 01:11:36,430
We're gonna put the bed by the window...

1396
01:11:36,542 --> 01:11:37,800
we got your apple juice, we'll put the pens and paper on the table.

1397
01:11:37,919 --> 01:11:40,922


1398
01:11:42,590 --> 01:11:45,384
- Did I forget something?
- The cheeseballs.

1399
01:11:44,290 --> 01:11:46,850
- Yes.
- Definitely have cheeseballs.

1400
01:11:45,551 --> 01:11:47,970


1401
01:11:46,960 --> 01:11:49,930
- I forgot the cheeseballs. We got 'em.
- I have to have 12 cheeseballs.

1402
01:11:48,137 --> 01:11:49,235


1403
01:11:49,345 --> 01:11:50,515


1404
01:11:50,070 --> 01:11:52,260
- Yes, definitely.
- Get my tartar-control toothpaste.

1405
01:11:50,681 --> 01:11:54,644


1406
01:11:52,370 --> 01:11:54,300
We got that for you a couple of days ago.

1407
01:11:54,810 --> 01:11:55,895
Where's my toothpaste?

1408
01:11:58,110 --> 01:11:59,200
Raymond.

1409
01:12:01,734 --> 01:12:04,654
Remember that doctor asked you those number questions today?

1410
01:12:04,680 --> 01:12:07,080
- Yeah.
- How did you do that?

1411
01:12:05,488 --> 01:12:07,323


1412
01:12:07,490 --> 01:12:08,991
I see it.

1413
01:12:09,158 --> 01:12:11,744
I see it.

1414
01:12:10,450 --> 01:12:12,390
What's that? Will you stop for a second?

1415
01:12:11,911 --> 01:12:14,247


1416
01:12:12,660 --> 01:12:14,050
I see it.

1417
01:12:14,413 --> 01:12:17,208
Put that down. I'm trying to talk to you.

1418
01:12:16,690 --> 01:12:18,960
When I say stop it, why don't you stop it?

1419
01:12:17,375 --> 01:12:19,255


1420
01:12:19,366 --> 01:12:21,921
Why do you always have to act like an idiot?

1421
01:12:22,130 --> 01:12:24,290
- Yeah.
- You think that's funny?

1422
01:12:23,798 --> 01:12:24,497


1423
01:12:24,608 --> 01:12:26,592
Yeah, funny Rain Man. Funny teeth.

1424
01:12:26,759 --> 01:12:28,886
- What'd you say?
- Funny teeth.

1425
01:12:28,470 --> 01:12:29,990
Rinse.

1426
01:12:29,053 --> 01:12:30,388


1427
01:12:35,210 --> 01:12:38,740
Why'd you say... Why'd you say funny teeth?

1428
01:12:35,726 --> 01:12:36,838


1429
01:12:37,866 --> 01:12:39,000


1430
01:12:39,105 --> 01:12:41,649
You said funny teeth, funny Rain Man.

1431
01:12:42,316 --> 01:12:43,535
"Rain man"? I said, "Rain man"?

1432
01:12:43,645 --> 01:12:45,778


1433
01:12:44,150 --> 01:12:46,050
Yeah, funny Rain Man.

1434
01:12:49,782 --> 01:12:52,535
Was I trying to say "Raymond" and it came out "rain man"?

1435
01:12:52,030 --> 01:12:53,930
Yeah. Funny Rain Man.

1436
01:12:52,702 --> 01:12:54,787


1437
01:12:55,955 --> 01:12:58,624
You? You're the rain man?

1438
01:13:12,847 --> 01:13:15,891
- Who took this picture?
- D-a-d.

1439
01:13:17,143 --> 01:13:18,185
- You lived with us?
- Yeah, 10961 Beechcrest Street...

1440
01:13:18,352 --> 01:13:22,523


1441
01:13:19,890 --> 01:13:22,250
Cincinnati, Ohio.

1442
01:13:22,690 --> 01:13:25,067
When did you leave?

1443
01:13:25,234 --> 01:13:29,113
January 21, 1965.

1444
01:13:28,130 --> 01:13:30,390
- You remember then?
- It was Thursday. Very snowy out.

1445
01:13:29,280 --> 01:13:33,659


1446
01:13:30,700 --> 01:13:33,100
7.2 inches. Snow that day.

1447
01:13:35,369 --> 01:13:37,335
- Just after Mom died. New Year's.
- Yeah, Mom died.

1448
01:13:37,445 --> 01:13:39,999


1449
01:13:38,110 --> 01:13:40,010
January 5, 1965.

1450
01:13:40,166 --> 01:13:42,376
And you remember that day that you left?

1451
01:13:42,543 --> 01:13:44,128
- Short and sudden illness.
- You remember that day you left?

1452
01:13:44,295 --> 01:13:47,131


1453
01:13:47,298 --> 01:13:49,425
Was I there? Where was I?

1454
01:13:49,050 --> 01:13:51,990
You were in the window. You waved to me.

1455
01:13:49,592 --> 01:13:51,385


1456
01:13:51,552 --> 01:13:54,639


1457
01:13:52,120 --> 01:13:54,820
"Bye-bye, Rain Man. Bye-bye, Rain Man."

1458
01:13:57,433 --> 01:14:00,936
So, you...

1459
01:13:59,230 --> 01:14:01,360
- You were the one that sang to me?
- Yeah.

1460
01:14:01,103 --> 01:14:02,688


1461
01:14:03,270 --> 01:14:07,170
What did you sing? What was that song?

1462
01:14:05,232 --> 01:14:09,528


1463
01:14:09,695 --> 01:14:12,657
What did you sing?

1464
01:14:12,780 --> 01:14:15,650
<i>♪ She was just 17

1465
01:14:15,820 --> 01:14:19,530
<i>♪ And you know what I mean

1466
01:14:19,700 --> 01:14:21,740
<i>♪ And the way she looked

1467
01:14:21,910 --> 01:14:25,250
<i>♪ Was way beyond compare

1468
01:14:25,420 --> 01:14:30,840
[both] <i>♪ So how could I dance with another

1469
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:32,960
<i>♪ Ooh

1470
01:14:33,130 --> 01:14:37,380
<i>♪ When I saw her standing there?

1471
01:14:37,550 --> 01:14:40,890
[Raymond] <i>♪ Da-da-da-da da-da-da-da

1472
01:14:42,645 --> 01:14:45,731
Did I like it when you sang to me?

1473
01:14:46,983 --> 01:14:48,450
Did we sing any other songs like the Beatles?

1474
01:14:49,533 --> 01:14:51,821


1475
01:14:54,615 --> 01:14:58,828
Scary! Hot! Scary bad!

1476
01:14:56,420 --> 01:14:59,290
Scary bad! Scary!

1477
01:14:58,995 --> 01:15:00,830


1478
01:15:04,166 --> 01:15:06,669
What's scary about it?

1479
01:15:06,836 --> 01:15:09,547
Hot water burn baby!

1480
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:11,930
- Water!
- "Hot water burn baby"?

1481
01:15:09,714 --> 01:15:12,091


1482
01:15:12,258 --> 01:15:13,467
- What baby? Me?
- Yeah.

1483
01:15:13,634 --> 01:15:14,635


1484
01:15:14,240 --> 01:15:15,930
- Yeah.
- Easy, easy.

1485
01:15:14,844 --> 01:15:16,929


1486
01:15:16,070 --> 01:15:19,300
- Water... Hot water burn baby.
- I'm not burned.

1487
01:15:17,096 --> 01:15:20,850


1488
01:15:19,440 --> 01:15:21,880
I'm not burned. Look at me, please.

1489
01:15:21,016 --> 01:15:22,059


1490
01:15:22,226 --> 01:15:23,936
- Water burn baby.
- Please. Please!

1491
01:15:24,103 --> 01:15:25,730
Hot water burn... Tub burn baby.

1492
01:15:25,896 --> 01:15:27,940


1493
01:15:27,080 --> 01:15:29,310
- I'm not burned.
- Tub burn baby.

1494
01:15:28,107 --> 01:15:30,443


1495
01:15:29,450 --> 01:15:31,320
- I'm not burned.
- Yeah.

1496
01:15:30,609 --> 01:15:32,778


1497
01:15:32,945 --> 01:15:35,489
I'm not burned. It's okay.

1498
01:15:35,656 --> 01:15:37,950


1499
01:15:37,390 --> 01:15:39,920
It's okay.

1500
01:15:39,785 --> 01:15:41,454


1501
01:15:47,084 --> 01:15:49,320
Time for Wallbrook now.

1502
01:15:49,587 --> 01:15:51,304
That's why they put you away.

1503
01:15:51,852 --> 01:15:53,632
They thought you'd hurt me.

1504
01:15:56,150 --> 01:15:58,170
Never hurt baby.

1505
01:15:58,429 --> 01:16:04,185
Never hurt Charlie Babbitt.

1506
01:16:00,980 --> 01:16:03,850
Never hurt Charlie.

1507
01:16:04,351 --> 01:16:06,645
What? What?

1508
01:16:05,950 --> 01:16:09,150
Never hurt Charlie Babbitt.

1509
01:16:07,313 --> 01:16:09,648


1510
01:16:10,357 --> 01:16:11,567
What, Ray?

1511
01:16:11,817 --> 01:16:14,320


1512
01:16:15,362 --> 01:16:16,947
What?

1513
01:16:21,243 --> 01:16:25,164
Come on. It's 11:00, Ray.

1514
01:16:23,110 --> 01:16:25,010
- Lights out.
- Yeah.

1515
01:16:34,381 --> 01:16:38,177
Never hurt Charlie Babbitt. Never hurt Charlie Babbitt.

1516
01:16:45,030 --> 01:16:47,930
There you go. Right where you like 'em, at the end of the bed.

1517
01:16:45,726 --> 01:16:49,146


1518
01:17:00,449 --> 01:17:02,117
Come on, Ray.

1519
01:17:49,248 --> 01:17:52,110
Hi, it's me.

1520
01:17:51,030 --> 01:17:53,050
You didn't hang up. Does that mean we're engaged?

1521
01:17:52,220 --> 01:17:53,502


1522
01:17:53,669 --> 01:17:56,005


1523
01:17:54,230 --> 01:17:55,860
Listen, I, uh...

1524
01:17:58,591 --> 01:18:00,405
I just wanna hear it's not over.

1525
01:18:02,342 --> 01:18:04,430
I'm scared it's over.

1526
01:18:04,597 --> 01:18:05,915
Don't ask me tonight. I don't know what to say.

1527
01:18:06,107 --> 01:18:07,892


1528
01:18:07,240 --> 01:18:10,770
- Let it sit.
- Something I'm not real good at.

1529
01:18:08,058 --> 01:18:10,811


1530
01:18:10,978 --> 01:18:13,772
There are a lot of things that you're not good at.

1531
01:18:13,939 --> 01:18:16,275
I'll call you when I get back, okay?

1532
01:18:19,987 --> 01:18:22,281
- I'll see you.
- Ciao.

1533
01:19:49,118 --> 01:19:50,369
Why are you looking at that? I bought a TV, and you're watching a dryer.

1534
01:19:50,480 --> 01:19:52,330


1535
01:19:52,440 --> 01:19:53,580


1536
01:19:53,220 --> 01:19:55,010
I don't know.

1537
01:19:53,747 --> 01:19:55,499


1538
01:19:55,150 --> 01:19:57,120
Because at the shrink hearing, we'll have to prove...

1539
01:19:55,666 --> 01:19:57,626


1540
01:19:57,250 --> 01:20:01,020
you prefer to watch TV as opposed to the clothes dryer, you understand that?

1541
01:19:57,793 --> 01:20:00,671


1542
01:20:00,838 --> 01:20:01,880
- Yeah.
- You listening to me?

1543
01:20:02,047 --> 01:20:04,350


1544
01:20:04,717 --> 01:20:07,303
Turn this off when you're not watching it.

1545
01:20:06,290 --> 01:20:08,260
- Yeah.
- You'll run down the batteries.

1546
01:20:07,469 --> 01:20:08,620


1547
01:20:08,730 --> 01:20:11,098
Then where will you be at 3:00 when Wapner's on?

1548
01:20:11,265 --> 01:20:13,559
Yeah. The red one always falls the same.

1549
01:20:13,726 --> 01:20:15,394
Why don't you listen to me?

1550
01:20:15,400 --> 01:20:17,300
You don't wanna listen to me, do you?

1551
01:20:16,395 --> 01:20:17,500


1552
01:20:17,611 --> 01:20:20,899
You wanna go back to Wallbrook?

1553
01:20:19,610 --> 01:20:22,240
I gotta make a phone call.

1554
01:20:21,066 --> 01:20:22,818


1555
01:20:33,203 --> 01:20:34,747
Lenny, it's me.

1556
01:20:34,913 --> 01:20:36,025
Where have you been? I've been sittin' by this phone for three hours.

1557
01:20:36,140 --> 01:20:38,083


1558
01:20:38,250 --> 01:20:39,798
I had to buy some clothes.

1559
01:20:39,900 --> 01:20:42,212
Clothes? Charlie, we are in serious trouble.

1560

01:33:35,780 --> 01:33:38,810
- It's gonna hit on twenty?
- Yeah. Definitely twenty.

1740
01:33:39,197 --> 01:33:41,032
$3,000 on 20.

1741
01:33:43,159 --> 01:33:44,711
- Definitely twenty.
- Definitely twenty?

1742
01:33:44,828 --> 01:33:46,371


1743
01:33:56,339 --> 01:33:58,370
- It's not your game.
- Yeah.

1744
01:33:58,477 --> 01:33:59,440
- I lost $3,000.
- Yeah.

1745
01:33:59,551 --> 01:34:02,512


1746
01:34:00,510 --> 01:34:02,770
That's $3,000 I lost. Come on, Ray.

1747
01:34:02,679 --> 01:34:03,888
Little black... No? Easy, easy.

1748
01:34:04,055 --> 01:34:07,308


1749
01:34:05,680 --> 01:34:07,700
Don't start banging yourself.

1750
01:34:07,475 --> 01:34:10,353
- Maybe we'll play later.
- Yeah.

1751
01:34:10,520 --> 01:34:11,430

- You make me sad, Ray.
- Yeah.

01:34:16,818 --> 01:34:17,986
Twenty.

1755
01:34:20,989 --> 01:34:23,533
We won $86,000 and some change.

1756
01:34:23,160 --> 01:34:24,860
- Right, Ray?
- 86,500.

1757
01:34:23,700 --> 01:34:25,952

$80,000. Refund on the car payments.

1759
01:34:27,287 --> 01:34:28,598


1760
01:34:28,705 --> 01:34:31,735


1761
01:34:29,370 --> 01:34:30,500
And I owe...

1762
01:34:30,600 --> 01:34:32,700
What did I say I owe to get the Rolex back?

1763
01:34:31,845 --> 01:34:32,884


1764
01:34:33,001 --> 01:34:36,171
- $3,500, six months to pay.
- $3,500.

1765
01:34:36,337 --> 01:34:37,330
We don't have to pay for a room. That's comped. I'm free and clear.

1766
01:34:37,440 --> 01:34:39,048


1767
01:34:39,215 --> 01:34:40,100


1768
01:34:40,220 --> 01:34:42,093
I'm gonna take a celebration piss.

1769
01:34:44,637 --> 01:34:46,630
Don't go anywhere. Until I get back, the sign says, "Don't walk."

1770
01:34:46,740 --> 01:34:47,849


1771
01:34:48,016 --> 01:34:50,268
- Don't walk.
- Don't walk.

1772
01:35:11,831 --> 01:35:14,542
Are you lookin' for a date?

1773
01:35:14,709 --> 01:35:16,628
I don't know.

1774
01:35:15,920 --> 01:35:17,780

1775
01:35:16,794 --> 01:35:19,172


1776
01:35:17,920 --> 01:35:20,080
My name is Iris.

1777
01:35:19,339 --> 01:35:23,134


1778
01:35:20,350 --> 01:35:22,080
Raymond, you like me?

1779
01:35:22,360 --> 01:35:23,650
I don't know.

1780
01:35:23,301 --> 01:35:26,896
You don't know.

1781
01:35:25,590 --> 01:35:29,320
If you gave me a chance, you would. Why don't we get to know each other?

1782
01:35:27,013 --> 01:35:29,182


1783
01:35:29,349 --> 01:35:30,655
- To get to know each other.
- He doesn't have any money, honey.

1784
01:35:31,050 --> 01:35:32,644


1785
01:35:34,437 --> 01:35:36,856
That's all right, sugar, 'cause we are just talkin'.

1786
01:35:37,023 --> 01:35:38,776
Yeah, we're just talking.

1787
01:35:40,279 --> 01:35:41,986
- Let's go upstairs. What are you doin'?
- Getting to know each other.

1788
01:35:42,153 --> 01:35:44,614


1789
01:35:43,880 --> 01:35:45,780
- Just talking.
- What room? I'll bring him up.

1790
01:35:44,781 --> 01:35:45,982


1791
01:35:46,084 --> 01:35:47,575
That's all right.

1792
01:35:48,618 --> 01:35:51,245
Do you want to stay and get to know each other?

1793
01:35:51,412 --> 01:35:53,998
Yeah, get to know each other. Just talking.

1794
01:35:54,665 --> 01:35:56,230
This will be interesting. I'll be over here.

1795
01:35:56,340 --> 01:35:58,544


1796
01:35:59,712 --> 01:36:01,420
- He doesn't seem to like me. Who is he?
- My brother. I'm living in his room.

1797
01:36:01,530 --> 01:36:03,299


1798
01:36:03,466 --> 01:36:05,110
- He seems young to be your brother.
- He was born August 12, 1962.

1799
01:36:05,220 --> 01:36:08,262


1800
01:36:08,429 --> 01:36:09,681
It was a Sunday.

1801
01:36:11,641 --> 01:36:13,476
What exactly do you guys do here?

1802
01:36:14,519 --> 01:36:17,730
- We're counting cards.
- You're counting cards?

1803
01:36:17,897 --> 01:36:19,816
We're counting cards.

1804
01:36:20,380 --> 01:36:22,410
We're counting cards.

1805
01:36:21,150 --> 01:36:23,477


1806
01:36:22,550 --> 01:36:24,570
What else do you do?

1807
01:36:24,821 --> 01:36:26,590
We're counting cards.

1808
01:36:26,692 --> 01:36:28,885
I know that. What else do you do?

1809
01:36:28,996 --> 01:36:30,952
Are you taking any prescription medication?

1810
01:36:30,890 --> 01:36:33,660
Whoa. Look, I'm outta here.

1811
01:36:32,120 --> 01:36:34,914


1812
01:36:35,081 --> 01:36:37,375

1815
01:36:41,796 --> 01:36:46,217
10:00, daylight saving time.

1816
01:36:45,410 --> 01:36:47,170
- 10:00, daylight saving...
- 10:00?

1817
01:36:46,384 --> 01:36:49,721


1818
01:36:47,310 --> 01:36:49,610

- Definitely very sparkly.
- Very sparkly.

1821
01:36:53,266 --> 01:36:54,475


1822
01:36:56,280 --> 01:36:59,220
You did a great job on that suit.

1823
01:36:57,645 --> 01:37:00,732


1824
01:36:59,320 --> 01:37:01,620
You don't realize how good you look. Do you like it?

1825
01:37:00,898 --> 01:37:01,622


1826
01:37:01,760 --> 01:37:02,734
It's not Kmart.

1827
01:37:03,762 --> 01:37:06,815
How could you not like that suit? You look fantastic, Ray?

1828
01:37:06,930 --> 01:37:07,955


1829
01:37:08,072 --> 01:37:09,330
- It's not a Kmart suit.
- Let me let you in on a secret.

1830
01:37:09,440 --> 01:37:10,742


1831
01:37:10,908 --> 01:37:13,745
- Kmart sucks. Okay?
- Yeah.

1832
01:37:17,165 --> 01:37:18,624
- There you go, Ray.
- Yeah.

1833
01:37:18,791 --> 01:37:20,460
It's a high roller's suite. This is for you.

1834
01:37:20,626 --> 01:37:22,870


1835
01:37:23,282 --> 01:37:24,672
- You ever seen a room like this before?
- Yeah.

1836
01:37:24,789 --> 01:37:27,216


1837
01:37:25,650 --> 01:37:27,080
What's up there?

1838
01:37:27,383 --> 01:37:29,592
What's up there? You're not even looking.

1839
01:37:29,719 --> 01:37:32,305
- Yeah. Bed.
- That's your bed.

1840
01:37:32,472 --> 01:37:34,430
I had them put it by the window, just the way you like it.

1841
01:37:34,540 --> 01:37:35,358


1842
01:37:35,475 --> 01:37:38,144
- Right by the window.
- Go on up.

1843
01:37:38,311 --> 01:37:40,646
- Just the way you like it, isn't it?
- Yeah.

1844
01:37:42,398 --> 01:37:44,233
Look at you with all those lights, Ray.

1845
01:37:44,942 --> 01:37:47,487
You are Mr. Las Vegas now.

1846
01:37:47,653 --> 01:37:49,439
What do you think?

1847
01:37:49,541 --> 01:37:52,635
There's a lot of lights out there. It's very sparkly. Very twinkly.

1848
01:37:53,645 --> 01:37:57,162
We made a lot of money today.

1849
01:37:57,288 --> 01:38:01,375
Forgetting the $3,000 that we tossed away at that wheel of fortune.

1850
01:38:01,542 --> 01:38:02,960
Yeah, 'Wheel Of Fortune.'

1851
01:38:03,795 --> 01:38:05,421
And I'm sorry about that. I got a little carried away.

1852
01:38:05,588 --> 01:38:09,342


1853
01:38:06,790 --> 01:38:10,520
I got a little hot, Ray.

1854
01:38:09,509 --> 01:38:10,593


1855
01:38:10,660 --> 01:38:14,750
I'm sayin' that I'm sorry, and I just want you to know that I am sorry.

1856
01:38:11,560 --> 01:38:12,550


1857
01:38:12,660 --> 01:38:14,806


1858
01:38:16,933 --> 01:38:20,269
I'm apologizing. I got a little carried away. The money.

1859
01:38:20,436 --> 01:38:24,315


1860
01:38:21,400 --> 01:38:25,430
I got a little greedy. Wanna say somethin'?

1861
01:38:24,582 --> 01:38:25,533


1862
01:38:25,677 --> 01:38:28,111
I have to be at the bar at 10:00 with Iris.

1863
01:38:28,277 --> 01:38:31,030
I gotta thank you, man.

1864
01:38:32,490 --> 01:38:34,249
You did it.

1865
01:38:34,386 --> 01:38:36,327
I was just there. You saved my ass.

1866
01:38:36,494 --> 01:38:37,378


1867
01:38:37,522 --> 01:38:40,373
I'm just along for the ride.

1868
01:38:40,540 --> 01:38:44,502
Be at the bar at 10:00. Have to go to a date with Iris.

- Know how to dance?
- I don't know.

1875

- I have to learn to dance with a date.
- I was just kidding.

1878
01:39:02,410 --> 01:39:04,500
You're not gonna have to dance on this date.

1879
01:39:03,187 --> 01:39:05,815


1880
01:39:04,640 --> 01:39:08,380

Just do what I'm doin'. Okay?

You feel the rhythm of the music? We're just movin' our feet.

The rhythm, the rhythm. All right?

1916
01:40:34,403 --> 01:40:35,080
You can't watch my feet the whole time, so you're gonna have to look up.

1921
01:40:44,956 --> 01:40:46,457

- Yeah.

01:40:46,624 --> 01:40:49,001
- Start lookin' up.
- Yeah.

1923
01:40:49,168 --> 01:40:53,047
A little more. Keep movin'.

01:40:53,214 --> 01:40:57,635


1926
01:40:54,350 --> 01:40:56,350
A little more, Ray.

1927
01:40:56,490 --> 01:40:58,460
All the way up.

1928
01:41:00,596 --> 01:41:02,139
There you go, Ray. You're dancin'.

You wanna put it like that. You're gonna turn me like this.

1933
01:41:08,896 --> 01:41:11,536


1934
01:41:12,733 --> 01:41:14,902
Just turn me. That's good.

1935
01:41:15,069 --> 01:41:17,822
- This is dancin'.
- This is dancing.

1936
01:41:17,989 --> 01:41:20,658
I don't know about you, but I'm startin' to feel a little silly.

1937
01:41:54,358 --> 01:41:58,529
- That's it.
- Yeah.

1938
01:41:57,350 --> 01:41:58,680
All right!

1939
01:41:58,696 --> 01:42:00,552
You are a good dancer.

1940
01:42:00,659 --> 01:42:01,624

What are you doin' here?

1946
01:42:39,945 --> 01:42:42,740
- I'm unemployed.
- What do you mean?

- Yeah, I know. Come on in.

Ray, look who's here.

It's not right, what you're doing to Raymond.

1952
01:43:22,238 --> 01:43:24,457
- He's fine.
- I know he's fine.

1953

Raymond, it'd be nice if you didn't carry that television everywhere we go.

1961
01:43:41,799 --> 01:43:44,385
Why do you have to bring a Watchman on your date?

1963

But what does your date look like, Raymond?

1964
01:43:49,390 --> 01:43:52,560
She's very sparkly. She looks like a holiday.

- Mr. Babbitt?

- So who gets it?
- Why shouldn't he?

- Yes.

- After all, the man earns it.
- Who does?

2082
01:50:35,504 --> 01:50:37,047
Absolutely.

2083
01:50:37,214 --> 01:50:39,883
All I'm tryin' to find out is what's the guy's name on first base?

2084
01:50:40,050 --> 01:50:41,844
No, What is on second base.

- Dad gave me a book on baseball trivia.

- Definitely not.

01:50:54,330 --> 01:50:55,607


2092
01:50:57,560 --> 01:51:01,290
Hello, this is Dr. Bruner. I'd like you to call me.

2093
01:50:58,068 --> 01:50:59,535


2094
01:51:00,230 --> 01:51:01,238


2095
01:51:01,405 --> 01:51:02,696
Yeah, what is it?

2096
01:51:02,834 --> 01:51:05,158
I thought I got the machine.

2097
01:51:05,325 --> 01:51:07,252


2098
01:51:06,400 --> 01:51:09,840
I just got into town, and the psychological interview is tomorrow.

2099
01:51:07,369 --> 01:51:10,539


2100
01:51:09,940 --> 01:51:11,900
Yes, sir, I know that.

2101
01:51:10,706 --> 01:51:11,909


2102
01:51:12,176 --> 01:51:14,084
I thought we should get together and talk.

2103
01:51:14,251 --> 01:51:17,921
I think it might be in your best interests to meet me.

2104
01:51:18,649 --> 01:51:19,840
When?

2105
01:51:20,007 --> 01:51:21,735
I'm at the Bonaventure.

2106
01:51:21,925 --> 01:51:23,218
How about tonight at 8:30?

2107
01:51:23,260 --> 01:51:27,090
[stereo] <i>♪ Winter's passed, spring and fall

2108
01:51:27,930 --> 01:51:30,720
<i>♪ You never wrote me

2109
01:51:30,890 --> 01:51:33,890
<i>♪ You never called

2110
01:51:34,890 --> 01:51:39,270
<i>♪ Nathan Jones, you've been gone too long

2111
01:51:45,532 --> 01:51:47,020
Tomorrow you'll meet Dr. Marston,

2112
01:51:47,130 --> 01:51:50,120
- who's in charge of Raymond's evaluation.
- Yeah, I know.

2113
01:51:50,287 --> 01:51:52,812
I gave him boxes of files on Raymond. Boxes.

2114
01:51:53,117 --> 01:51:54,041
Good luck.

2115
01:51:54,207 --> 01:51:56,960
Look, this isn't a close call, son. It's a formality.

2116
01:51:57,127 --> 01:51:58,720
Your brother's a very disabled individual.

2117
01:51:58,850 --> 01:52:01,798
Are you trying to tell me that Marston's gonna rule against me?

2118
01:52:01,965 --> 01:52:04,343
No, I'm telling you it's always been a lost cause.

2119
01:52:04,509 --> 01:52:06,687
- Then why did you call me?
- Let me tell you something.

2120
01:52:06,803 --> 01:52:07,680


2121
01:52:07,799 --> 01:52:09,890
Your father put me in charge of all the money.

2122
01:52:10,057 --> 01:52:12,893


2123
01:52:10,600 --> 01:52:13,460
It doesn't matter whether or not you win custody of Raymond.

2124
01:52:13,060 --> 01:52:15,130


2125
01:52:13,570 --> 01:52:16,690
I won't have to pay you a dime. It's at my discretion.

2126
01:52:15,350 --> 01:52:16,813


2127
01:52:16,980 --> 01:52:18,410
- So you can't lose?
- I can lose. I can lose Raymond.

2128
01:52:18,550 --> 01:52:21,151


2129
01:52:21,318 --> 01:52:22,835
I care about your brother's life and the treatment he receives.

2130
01:52:22,945 --> 01:52:23,946


2131
01:52:24,112 --> 01:52:26,384
I made a commitment to your father some 20 years ago...

2132
01:52:26,518 --> 01:52:28,784


2133
01:52:27,510 --> 01:52:29,640
and I'm not willing to gamble with that.

2134
01:52:29,780 --> 01:52:31,610
What is this?

2135
01:52:30,535 --> 01:52:31,618


2136
01:52:31,722 --> 01:52:33,330
It's a very big check.

2137
01:52:36,750 --> 01:52:38,585
$250,000.

2138
01:52:38,752 --> 01:52:40,222
And no strings attached. Just walk away, Charlie.

2139
01:52:40,552 --> 01:52:42,089


2140
01:52:43,465 --> 01:52:45,497
This isn't about you and me.

2141
01:52:45,736 --> 01:52:48,011
It's not about winning or losing.

2142
01:52:50,400 --> 01:52:53,860
I asked you a week ago, why didn't anyone ever tell me I had a brother?

2143
01:52:54,310 --> 01:52:56,300
You didn't have an answer.

2144
01:52:57,437 --> 01:52:58,855
I don't know.

2145
01:53:00,810 --> 01:53:03,250
It's funny that I just realized I'm not pissed off anymore...

2146
01:53:03,320 --> 01:53:05,550
my father cut me out of his will.

2147
01:53:06,920 --> 01:53:10,690
You were his friend. You probably knew he tried to contact me a few times over the years.

2148
01:53:10,993 --> 01:53:13,495
I never called him back. I was a prick.

2149
01:53:13,662 --> 01:53:15,535
If he was my son and didn't return my calls, I'd have written him out.

2150
01:53:15,645 --> 01:53:17,374


2151
01:53:17,541 --> 01:53:21,211
But it's not about the money anymore.

2152
01:53:21,378 --> 01:53:24,374
You know, I just don't understand.

2153
01:53:24,475 --> 01:53:26,130
Why didn't he tell me I had a brother?

2154
01:53:26,240 --> 01:53:27,444


2155
01:53:27,578 --> 01:53:31,263
Why didn't anyone ever tell me that I had a brother?

2156
01:53:34,683 --> 01:53:35,851
Because it'd have been nice to know him for more than just the past six days.

2157
01:53:36,018 --> 01:53:38,937


2158
01:55:03,647 --> 01:55:06,358


2159
01:55:21,331 --> 01:55:23,500


2160
01:55:23,660 --> 01:55:26,280
Ray! Come on.

2161
01:55:26,430 --> 01:55:29,360
It stopped. It's all right.

2162
01:55:35,870 --> 01:55:37,770
V-E-R-N.

2163
01:55:37,870 --> 01:55:40,340
Vern. Vern.

2164
01:55:40,440 --> 01:55:43,270
My main man, Vern.

2165
01:55:43,410 --> 01:55:45,640
V-E-R-N.

2166
01:55:52,620 --> 01:55:54,750
My main man, Vern.

2167
01:55:57,590 --> 01:56:01,330
V-E-R-N. Vern, my main man.

2168
01:56:01,330 --> 01:56:03,560
They got raspberry, strawberry, blueberry...

2169
01:56:03,660 --> 01:56:06,360
whole wheat, peachy keen, beer nut, rocky road, buckwheat.

2170
01:56:06,500 --> 01:56:09,660
How about buckwheat? What kind of pancakes you want, Ray?

2171
01:56:09,740 --> 01:56:11,600
- Pancakes.
- Yeah. What kind?

2172
01:56:11,740 --> 01:56:13,530
- Pancakes.
- Of course.

2173
01:56:13,842 --> 01:56:16,428
The maple syrup is supposed to be on the table before the pan...

2174
01:56:16,590 --> 01:56:19,420
- Ray? Ta-da!
- Yeah?

2175
01:56:21,766 --> 01:56:23,279
Charlie Babbitt made a joke.

2176
01:56:23,397 --> 01:56:25,612
- I made a joke, Ray.
- Yeah.

2177
01:56:25,979 --> 01:56:28,690


2178
01:56:45,457 --> 01:56:47,334
Step back a little bit.

2179
01:57:07,771 --> 01:57:09,356
Hello?

2180
01:57:10,565 --> 01:57:12,776
Why don't you go sit down over there?

2181
01:57:16,613 --> 01:57:18,114
Hello?

2182
01:57:18,281 --> 01:57:20,110
This is not a legal proceeding, so there's no judge present...

2183
01:57:20,220 --> 01:57:21,952


2184
01:57:22,118 --> 01:57:25,288
just the people who care about Raymond.

2185
01:57:24,780 --> 01:57:28,650
Raymond, have a seat over there. Mr. Babbitt, other side of the table.

2186
01:57:25,455 --> 01:57:27,040


2187
01:57:27,207 --> 01:57:28,833


2188
01:57:29,000 --> 01:57:33,129
Raymond, right here. How about this seat?

2189
01:57:31,520 --> 01:57:34,580
- Take this seat.
- Put your knapsack on the floor.

2190
01:57:33,296 --> 01:57:34,965


2191
01:57:35,131 --> 01:57:37,676
This is a good opportunity to be honest with one another.

2192
01:57:37,842 --> 01:57:40,887
Ray, the TV? On the floor. I'm sorry.

2193
01:57:41,054 --> 01:57:42,639


2194
01:57:42,806 --> 01:57:45,934
I don't know an easy way to say this, Mr. Babbitt...

2195
01:57:46,101 --> 01:57:47,936
Have I lost already?

2196
01:57:48,103 --> 01:57:50,814
No, you haven't lost. I'm not the judge and jury.

2197
01:57:50,400 --> 01:57:52,460
I'm just making a recommendation to a court.

2198
01:57:50,981 --> 01:57:52,732


2199
01:57:52,899 --> 01:57:54,010
I must tell you that Dr. Bruner is a very respected professional.

2200
01:57:54,120 --> 01:57:56,486


2201
01:57:56,653 --> 01:57:59,289
Raymond's case has been meticulously documented over the years...

2202
01:57:59,406 --> 01:58:00,330
and Wallbrook is one of the finest institutions in this country.

2203
01:58:00,440 --> 01:58:02,492


2204
01:58:02,659 --> 01:58:03,915
You've made up your mind. I'll see you in court.

2205
01:58:04,025 --> 01:58:05,078


2206
01:58:05,245 --> 01:58:07,810
My brother came further with me than he did with you in 20 years.

2207
01:58:07,920 --> 01:58:09,541


2208
01:58:08,620 --> 01:58:11,180
- It's not necessary to...
- You don't know anything about us.

2209
01:58:09,708 --> 01:58:11,334


2210
01:58:11,501 --> 01:58:13,815
- It's not necessary to challenge him.
- I'm sorry.

2211
01:58:13,925 --> 01:58:14,713


2212
01:58:14,879 --> 01:58:17,215
Exactly what happened this past week, Raymond?

2213
01:58:17,260 --> 01:58:19,730
- We got to know each other.
- I was asking Raymond.

2214
01:58:20,093 --> 01:58:22,345
Raymond, what happened this past week?

2215
01:58:23,340 --> 01:58:25,270
- What did you do?
- Counted cards.

2216
01:58:25,400 --> 01:58:27,370
- Counted cards?
- Counted cards in Las Vegas.

2217
01:58:27,510 --> 01:58:31,410
- Your brother took you to Las Vegas?
- Lost $3,000 on the wheel of fortune.

2218
01:58:31,510 --> 01:58:33,270
Gave you $3,000 to gamble with?

2219
01:58:33,410 --> 01:58:36,440
Lost $3,000 on pitiful 20.

2220
01:58:36,550 --> 01:58:38,740
- And what else did you do?
- Bet on number 20.

2221
01:58:38,850 --> 01:58:42,180
- What else did you do?
- Danced with Charlie Babbitt.

2222
01:58:42,290 --> 01:58:44,220
- Danced with your brother?
- He wanted to learn.

2223
01:58:44,492 --> 01:58:47,203
Danced in the elevator with Susanna. Kissed Susanna.

2224
01:58:47,290 --> 01:58:49,420
- You kissed Susanna?
- Yeah, in the elevator.

2225
01:58:49,500 --> 01:58:52,227
- Did you enjoy kissing a woman?
- I don't know.

2226
01:58:52,630 --> 01:58:54,720
- How did it feel?
- It felt wet.

2227
01:58:55,211 --> 01:58:56,713
- Wet?
- Yeah.

2228
01:58:56,880 --> 01:58:59,304
- Quite a trip, huh?
- Yeah.

2229
01:59:00,091 --> 01:59:02,594
- Did you enjoy being on the road?
- I'm an excellent driver.

2230
01:59:02,761 --> 01:59:04,721
- You drove?
- Yeah.

2231
01:59:04,888 --> 01:59:08,391
- Your brother let you drive the highway?
- Slow on the driveway.

2232
01:59:08,558 --> 01:59:10,727
He didn't drive on the highway.

2233
01:59:12,395 --> 01:59:14,439
- Did he have any emotional outbursts?
- What do you mean?

2234
01:59:14,606 --> 01:59:16,855
Well, things they tend to do when...

2235
01:59:17,216 --> 01:59:18,817
Inflict bodily harm on themselves.

2236
01:59:18,943 --> 01:59:21,363
- Okay, a couple of times.
- A couple of times?

2237
01:59:21,529 --> 01:59:25,033
Okay. He had what you call an outburst at the airport because he didn't wanna fly.

2238
01:59:25,200 --> 01:59:27,952
- So we didn't fly.
- When was his last outburst?

2239
01:59:28,119 --> 01:59:29,829
- This morning when...
- This morning?

2240
01:59:29,996 --> 01:59:31,247
This is bullshit,

2241
01:59:31,414 --> 01:59:35,335
because I could tell you anything or tell you nothing. You'd never know the difference.

2242
01:59:35,502 --> 01:59:37,147
This morning the smoke alarm went off.

2243
01:59:37,214 --> 01:59:40,090
He got nervous, but he's fine now.

2244
01:59:40,256 --> 01:59:41,411
Don't feel as I'm placing any blame.

2245
01:59:41,552 --> 01:59:44,180
We went out for pancakes. He's fine.

2246
01:59:44,280 --> 01:59:47,754
- You don't have to be defensive.
- I'm just being honest with you.

2247
01:59:47,931 --> 01:59:50,684
- I think you're missing the point.
- No, you're missing the point. I'm being truthful about this.

2248
01:59:50,850 --> 01:59:52,727
I'm not placing any blame...

2249
01:59:52,894 --> 01:59:56,022
I had a father I hardly knew, a mother I didn't know at all.

2250
01:59:56,189 --> 01:59:57,895
I find out a few days ago that I have a brother,

2251
01:59:58,010 --> 01:59:59,734
and I'm supposed to give him up?

2252
01:59:59,901 --> 02:00:01,470
No one is saying anything.

2253
02:00:01,572 --> 02:00:04,781
I didn't hurt him, he's not hurting me, we're not hurting you.

2254
02:00:04,948 --> 02:00:06,950
- Why are you interfering? This is my family.
- I'm not interfering.

2255
02:00:07,117 --> 02:00:09,555
- This is my family.
- I understand that.

2256
02:00:09,650 --> 02:00:10,732
Listen. You do have a brother, 

2257
02:00:10,732 --> 02:00:13,832
but the point is, your brother is not capable of having a relationship with you.

2258
02:00:13,998 --> 02:00:17,461
That's your opinion. Did you spend 24 hours a day, seven days a week with him? 

2259
02:00:17,461 --> 02:00:18,461
Have you ever done that?

2260
02:00:18,628 --> 02:00:21,838
Look. You cannot care for your brother without professional guidance.

2261
02:00:21,965 --> 02:00:24,551
- That's your opinion.
- Yes, it's my opinion.

2262
02:00:24,718 --> 02:00:26,461
There's some things I'd like to go over.

2263
02:00:26,563 --> 02:00:28,638
Dr. Bruner states a week ago you stole Raymond out of the institution...

2264
02:00:28,805 --> 02:00:30,260


2265
02:00:30,367 --> 02:00:33,268
and were willing to trade him for $1.5 million, correct?

2266
02:00:33,435 --> 02:00:35,127
My father died. I was upset.

2267
02:00:35,272 --> 02:00:36,938
That was wrong.

2268
02:00:37,105 --> 02:00:38,330
Last week you were upset,

2269
02:00:38,440 --> 02:00:40,575
and this week you've found a devotion to him...

2270
02:00:40,692 --> 02:00:42,948
and you want to take care of him.

2271
02:00:43,088 --> 02:00:45,418
Yes.

2272
02:00:45,447 --> 02:00:48,158
From the beginning it was like a kidnapping.

2273
02:00:48,324 --> 02:00:49,965
Kidnapping. That's very strong.

2274
02:00:50,080 --> 02:00:51,411
I didn't kidnap my brother.

2275
02:00:51,578 --> 02:00:54,756
But in the course of a week, you came to have an understanding with him.

2276
02:00:55,123 --> 02:00:56,374
Yes.

2277
02:00:56,541 --> 02:00:58,752
- Look, that...
- Yes?

2278
02:00:58,918 --> 02:01:01,796
I understand that this sounds irrational to you.

2279
02:01:01,963 --> 02:01:03,699
When it started out...

2280
02:01:03,834 --> 02:01:06,134
Don't feel compelled to be defensive.

2281
02:01:06,301 --> 02:01:08,803
- Can I talk? I'd like to talk.
- Yes, you can.

2282
02:01:08,970 --> 02:01:09,533
Thank you.

2283
02:01:09,840 --> 02:01:12,015
There's no accusations. Go ahead.

2284
02:01:12,182 --> 02:01:14,434
No accusations?

2285
02:01:16,102 --> 02:01:19,647
See, you have to understand that when we started out together...

2286
02:01:19,814 --> 02:01:22,588
that he was only my brother...

2287
02:01:22,688 --> 02:01:24,058
in name.

2288
02:01:27,739 --> 02:01:29,365
And then...

2289
02:01:32,535 --> 02:01:34,871
this morning we had pancakes.

2290
02:01:35,038 --> 02:01:38,791
Maple syrup. Maple syrup on the...

2291
02:01:37,008 --> 02:01:39,568
Maple syrup on the table.

2292
02:01:38,958 --> 02:01:39,420


2293
02:01:39,536 --> 02:01:41,766
And Charlie Babbitt made a joke.

2294
02:01:43,278 --> 02:01:44,538
See, we...

2295
02:01:46,488 --> 02:01:47,848
I made a connection.

2296
02:01:48,092 --> 02:01:49,922
I think it's admirable that you made a connection...

2297
02:01:50,035 --> 02:01:53,678
but the purpose of this meeting is to determine what is best for Raymond...

2298
02:01:53,817 --> 02:01:56,768
whether or not he's capable of functioning in the community...

2299
02:01:56,935 --> 02:02:00,396
and what, in fact, he wants, if that's possible to determine.

2300
02:02:00,563 --> 02:02:01,651
I'm all for that.

2301
02:02:01,968 --> 02:02:04,988
- Raymond's unable to make those kind of decisions.
- You're wrong.

2302
02:02:05,298 --> 02:02:06,998
You know he can't decide for himself.

2303
02:02:07,153 --> 02:02:09,489
He's capable of a lot more than you know.

2304
02:02:09,697 --> 02:02:10,715
Why don't we ask Raymond?

2305
02:02:10,825 --> 02:02:11,950
Maybe we can find the answers.

2306
02:02:12,116 --> 02:02:15,402
Raymond, can I ask you a few questions?

2307
02:02:16,113 --> 02:02:17,120
- Ray, the doctor's talking to you.
- Yeah.

2308
02:02:17,247 --> 02:02:19,674
- Can I ask you a few questions?
- Yeah.

2309
02:02:22,168 --> 02:02:25,380
Do you wanna stay with your brother Charlie?

2310
02:02:25,547 --> 02:02:28,550
Raymond, would you like to stay with your brother Charlie in Los Angeles?

2311
02:02:28,716 --> 02:02:31,094
Ray, the doctor's asking you a question.

2312
02:02:31,261 --> 02:02:33,304
- So you listen.
- Yeah.

2313
02:02:33,471 --> 02:02:37,350
Raymond, do you wanna stay with your brother Charlie?

2314
02:02:37,517 --> 02:02:40,520
- Raymond, do you wanna stay with your brother Charlie?
- Yeah.

2315
02:02:40,687 --> 02:02:42,539
- You do?
- Yeah.

2316
02:02:43,106 --> 02:02:44,235
You wanna stay with your brother?

2317
02:02:44,345 --> 02:02:47,443
Yeah. I wanna stay with my brother Charlie Babbitt.

2318
02:02:47,610 --> 02:02:49,863
- That's what you want?
- Yeah.

2319
02:02:51,406 --> 02:02:53,878
- You wanna stay with your brother?
- Yeah.

2320
02:02:57,328 --> 02:03:00,081
- Can I ask you something else?
- Yeah.

2321
02:03:00,248 --> 02:03:03,251
- You wanna go back to Wallbrook?
- Yeah.

2322
02:03:03,418 --> 02:03:06,796
Raymond, can you make a distinction between your brother and Wallbrook?

2323
02:03:06,996 --> 02:03:07,528
Yeah.

2324
02:03:09,674 --> 02:03:14,220
- Do you wanna stay with your brother Charlie here in Los Angel?
- Yeah.

2325
02:03:14,387 --> 02:03:16,368
- Or do you wanna go to Wallbrook?
- Yeah.

2326
02:03:16,508 --> 02:03:18,498
They're two separate things.

2327
02:03:18,508 --> 02:03:20,059
Stay with your brother or go back to Wallbrook?

2328
02:03:20,226 --> 02:03:22,413
It's not one thing, Raymond.

2329
02:03:22,413 --> 02:03:23,813
Here is your brother, you make the choice...

2330
02:03:23,980 --> 02:03:25,815
- Back to Wallbrook, stay with Charlie.
- Okay.

2331
02:03:26,130 --> 02:03:29,705
- Back to Wallbrook, stay with Charlie.
- No, no, no. They're two separate things. Can you make that choice?

2332
02:03:29,823 --> 02:03:32,363
- One or the other.
- Go back to Wallbrook.

2333
02:03:32,530 --> 02:03:36,117
All right, all right, all right. Hold on, just hold on.

2334
02:03:36,058 --> 02:03:37,688
All right.

2335
02:03:37,798 --> 02:03:40,330
All right, all right. You made your point.

2336
02:03:40,496 --> 02:03:42,715
You don't have to humiliate him.

2337
02:03:43,210 --> 02:03:45,251
Ray, it's okay.

2338
02:03:45,418 --> 02:03:47,587
- It's over.
- Yeah.

2339
02:03:47,754 --> 02:03:50,508
Stay back at Wallbrook with Charlie Babbitt.

2340
02:03:50,638 --> 02:03:52,842
- Stay back at Wallbrook...
- It's over.

2341
02:03:53,848 --> 02:03:55,778
- Raymond?
- Yeah.

2342
02:03:58,718 --> 02:04:00,478
Dr. Bruner, can I talk to you?

2343
02:04:00,711 --> 02:04:02,060
Excuse me.

2344
02:04:10,860 --> 02:04:12,695
- You okay, Ray?
- Yeah.

2345
02:04:14,989 --> 02:04:17,742
- You don't want more questions, do you?
- No.

2346
02:04:20,703 --> 02:04:22,497
I don't know.

2347
02:04:27,835 --> 02:04:29,796
- No more questions, do you?
- No.

2348
02:04:29,963 --> 02:04:31,923
- No more questions.
- No.

2349
02:04:35,301 --> 02:04:37,847
- Don't worry, it's gonna be no more questions. Okay?
- Yeah.

2350
02:04:38,248 --> 02:04:40,064
No more questions. I'll make sure of that. Okay?

2351
02:04:40,181 --> 02:04:41,559
Yeah, main man.

2352
02:04:43,226 --> 02:04:45,036
- What?
- My main man.

2353
02:04:49,774 --> 02:04:51,017
Listen.

2354
02:04:54,946 --> 02:04:57,949
Ray, I don't know if I'm gonna have a chance to talk to you again.

2355
02:05:01,494 --> 02:05:03,237
Because you see, these...

2356
02:05:04,107 --> 02:05:06,049
Dr. Bruner really likes you a lot,

2357
02:05:06,165 --> 02:05:09,293
and he's probably gonna take you back with him.

2358
02:05:09,460 --> 02:05:11,370
- You know?
- Yeah.

2359
02:05:13,006 --> 02:05:14,966
But I just want you know that what I said about...

2360
02:05:15,133 --> 02:05:17,250
being on the road with you I meant.

2361
02:05:18,355 --> 02:05:19,762
Connecting.

2362
02:05:21,556 --> 02:05:23,350
I like having you for my brother.

2363
02:05:23,460 --> 02:05:25,101
I'm an excellent driver.

2364
02:05:27,395 --> 02:05:28,980
Yes, you are.

2365
02:05:55,965 --> 02:05:58,843
I like having you for my big brother.

2366
02:06:01,471 --> 02:06:02,139
Yeah.

2367
02:06:17,570 --> 02:06:19,781
C-H-A-R-L-I-E.

2368
02:06:22,992 --> 02:06:25,787
C-H-A-R-L-I-E.

2369
02:06:26,662 --> 02:06:28,331
Main man.

2370
02:07:02,031 --> 02:07:03,825
May I have your attention, please?

2371
02:07:03,991 --> 02:07:07,954
Amtrak train number 36, the Desert Wind, eastbound...

2372
02:07:08,121 --> 02:07:10,289
now boarding, track number three.

2373
02:07:10,278 --> 02:07:13,638
- Fullerton, San Bernardino, Barstow...
- Ray.

2374
02:07:13,778 --> 02:07:17,908
Las Vegas, Salt Lake City, Denver, Omaha, Chicago.

2375
02:07:24,887 --> 02:07:26,264
- Hello, Charlie.
- Dr. Bruner.

2376
02:07:26,430 --> 02:07:27,248
Hello, Raymond.

2377
02:07:27,384 --> 02:07:30,059
Wouldn't you feel more relaxed in your favorite Kmart clothes?

2378
02:07:30,226 --> 02:07:31,444
Tell him, Ray.

2379
02:07:31,588 --> 02:07:33,588
- Kmart sucks.
- I see.

2380
02:07:33,728 --> 02:07:37,859
I have the tickets, and I'll be on this car right here to the right.

2381
02:07:38,025 --> 02:07:39,535
Why don't you take a couple of minutes?

2382
02:07:39,920 --> 02:07:41,079
See you, Charlie.

2383
02:07:42,864 --> 02:07:45,658
- You made a joke, Ray.
- Yeah. Ha-ha-ha.

2384
02:07:50,580 --> 02:07:52,650
I guess I'd better give this to you.

2385
02:07:53,101 --> 02:07:54,584
You're gonna have to carry this now.

2386
02:07:55,779 --> 02:07:58,796
It's got your cheeseballs, your apple juice...

2387
02:07:58,963 --> 02:08:01,417
notebooks, pens and...

2388
02:08:01,518 --> 02:08:04,093
"Who's On First?" video that you like.

2389
02:08:04,260 --> 02:08:05,435
"Who's On First?" is very funny.

2390
02:08:05,950 --> 02:08:07,221
I told you it's funny.

2391
02:08:07,388 --> 02:08:08,764
Board!

2392
02:08:08,931 --> 02:08:10,130
Better get goin'.

2393
02:08:10,241 --> 02:08:11,851
Yeah. Very shiny train.

2394
02:08:12,018 --> 02:08:14,437
Yeah, it sure is.

2395
02:08:14,604 --> 02:08:15,610
Now listen, Ray.

2396
02:08:15,924 --> 02:08:17,690
Dr. Bruner only has custody of you.

2397
02:08:17,857 --> 02:08:20,432
That doesn't mean I can't visit.

2398
02:08:20,570 --> 02:08:23,446
I'm comin' to see you in two weeks.

2399
02:08:23,613 --> 02:08:25,350
How many days is that, for we together again?

2400
02:08:25,460 --> 02:08:26,575
Fourteen days from today.

2401
02:08:26,578 --> 02:08:28,478
- Today's Wednesday.
- And hours?

2402
02:08:29,618 --> 02:08:31,018
336 hours.

2403
02:08:31,288 --> 02:08:32,518
Mystifying.

2404
02:08:33,873 --> 02:08:36,083
'Course, that's 20,160 minutes.

2405
02:08:36,250 --> 02:08:41,130
1,209,600 seconds.

2406
02:08:41,028 --> 02:08:42,558
Ray?

2407
02:08:48,930 --> 02:08:50,139
Yeah?

2408
02:08:54,894 --> 02:08:56,437
I'll see you soon.

2409
02:08:56,604 --> 02:08:59,148
Yeah. One for bad, two for good.

2410
02:09:03,444 --> 02:09:06,364
Bet two for good.

2411
02:09:17,124 --> 02:09:19,211
Three minutes to Wapner.

2412
02:09:20,378 --> 02:09:21,246
You'll make it.

2413
02:09:23,778 --> 02:09:24,346
Yeah.

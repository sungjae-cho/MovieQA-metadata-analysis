1
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:39,993
Lunchtime!

2
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:44,230
The longer you animals bark,
the colder your lunch gets.

3
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:47,080
Come on, move it out.
You too, down there!

4
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:48,190
Hey, turkey!

5
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:07,032
"You schmuck. Do you think
I'd be stupid enough to kill myself?"

6
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:09,429
Kill myself?

7
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,435
Come on!

8
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,598
Here he comes.

9
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,514
Francis, the lock.

10
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:53,749
Let go of the handle.

11
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,831
I don't have the handle! Open it!

12
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,149
Jake, up!

13
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,595
Come on, move! Get on!

14
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:01,990
Thanks, Mama.

15
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,588
Okay, you guys.
Let's try the victory pyramid.

16
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,675
Okay, let's go.

17
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,911
Come on. Put your arms up.

18
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,872
Smile. Good, we got it!

19
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:17,513
Turn that TV off.
I can't hear myself think.

20
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,079
Yeah, right, Dad.

21
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,231
Is the water going down, son?

22
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,029
- Nope.
- Is it going down now?

23
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,113
Wow, a police chase!

24
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,315
Oh, shit!

25
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,679
What are we doing here?

26
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,558
Trust in your mother, boys.

27
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,951
Throw her into four-wheel drive
and hold on to your hats.

28
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,639
Bummer!

29
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:18,630
Nothing exciting ever happens
around here anyway.

30
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,233
Who needs the Goon Docks?

31
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:24,471
Who needs this house?
I can't wait to get out of here.

32
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,074
Really?

33
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:31,071
No, I was just trying to delate
myself. No, no...

34
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,719
Dictate myself.

35
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,996
That's delude yourself, dummy.

36
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,799
That's what I said.

37
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:47,954
Thanks, Brand.

38
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,112
I know how you feel, wimp.

39
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:54,076
I'm sure gonna miss this place too.

40
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,075
Adopted wuss.

41
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,155
I'm no adopted wuss!

42
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,198
I'll kill you, Brand!

43
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:08,955
It's Mouth.

44
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,234
Hey, Mikey.

45
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,558
Yo, Mikey.

46
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:16,873
Hey, Mikey, seen Adrienne?

47
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,710
- What's going down?
- Get your foot off the table.

48
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:22,155
You got it. What's going down, guys?

49
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,678
What's the matter with you guys?

50
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:27,480
What's the matter? What is this?
A nuclear Saturday?

51
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,994
Come on, guys.

52
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,231
This is our last weekend together.

53
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,112
Last Goonie weekend.

54
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:35,710
We gotta be going out in style.

55
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,552
Cruising the coast,
sniffing some lace...

56
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,598
...downing the brews, but no!

57
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:45,832
The one older brother had to go
and screw it up.

58
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:51,229
Flunking your driver's test?
I don't know what to do with you.

59
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,477
You guys, let me in!

60
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,755
Jerk alert.

61
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,793
It's Chunk.

62
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:00,718
I just saw the most amazing thing
in my entire life!

63
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,678
First, do the Truffle Shuffle.

64
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,434
Come on!

65
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:05,989
Do it.

66
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,469
Come on!

67
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:08,756
Do it!

68
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,559
Cut it out, Mouth.

69
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,599
Get out.

70
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:51,032
You guys won't believe me.
I'm telling the truth.

71
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,076
You turd!

72
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,878
- Flunked your driver's test.
- Shut up.

73
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:57,954
Listen, you'll never believe me.
There was two cop cars, okay?

74
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:01,033
They were chasing this four-wheel
deal, a real neat ORV.

75
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:05,159
Bullets flying everywhere. It was
the most amazing thing I ever saw!

76
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:08,836
More amazing than when
Michael Jackson used your bathroom?

77
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:12,516
More amazing than when you saved
those old people from that fire?

78
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:16,230
More amazing than when you ate your
weight in Godfather's pizza?

79
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:20,832
Okay, Michael Jackson didn't come to
my house to use the bathroom.

80
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,115
But his sister did.

81
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,471
Okay, Data, don't mess this one up.

82
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,757
Prepare for the Wings of Flight.

83
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,353
- Open the door!
- Mikey!

84
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:38,436
The screen door!

85
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:47,633
Hey! I bet you guys thought I
was gonna drop it, huh?

86
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,952
I know you'd expect that from Chunk.

87
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,349
- You idiot!
- Oh, my God!

88
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:56,751
Look, it's not broken.
It's perfect.

89
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,552
- Oh, my God!
- What?

90
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:02,872
- That's my mom's most favorite piece!
- What?

91
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,114
Oh, my God.

92
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,430
- You wouldn't be here if it wasn't.
- Shut up!

93
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,396
Shut up, Mouth.

94
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,074
- Any of you guys ever hear of Detroit?
- No.

95
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:14,232
Certainly. It's where Motown started.

96
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,397
Also got the country's
highest murder rate.

97
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,598
That's where we move to when we
lose our house tomorrow.

98
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:22,638
Shut up. It'll never
happen. My dad'll fix it.

99
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,552
Yeah, sure he will.

100
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,468
If he gets his next 400 paychecks
by tomorrow.

101
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:30,109
That's wrong, Brand.
It won't happen!

102
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,119
- Oh, hi, Mom.
- Hi, Mom.

103
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,115
Hi, hi!

104
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,194
I see Data dropped by.

105
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,710
Hi, Mrs. Walsh. How are you?

106
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,709
Boys, this is Rosalita.

107
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:48,270
She'll help with the packing until
my arm's better.

108
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:54,116
Boys, Rosalita doesn't speak a word
of English...

109
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,669
...and I know some of you took
Spanish in school.

110
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:00,277
Well, Mrs. Walsh, I speak
perfect Spanish.

111
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:04,439
If it's any help to you, I'd be glad
to communicate with Rosalita.

112
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:07,274
You're a lifesaver, Clark.
Come with us, will you?

113
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,033
Certainly, Mrs. Walsh.

114
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:12,909
Mikey, no more potato chips.
Hello, Mikey.

115
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:13,990
It's Brand, Ma.

116
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:19,516
What?

117
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,314
I wonder if she'll notice.

118
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,715
That's what I said!

119
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,871
Of course. She notices everything.

120
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:30,236
Pants and shirts are in the second.

121
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:34,308
Just throw them all into boxes.
Forget the suitcases.

122
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:35,959
Can you translate that?

123
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:39,476
- Certainly, Mrs. Walsh.
- That's wonderful.

124
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,154
Look. How's that?

125
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:56,233
You idiot!
You glued it on upside down!

126
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:59,358
If God meant it that way,
you'd be pissing in your faces.

127
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:00,675
Looks fine to me.

128
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:05,630
Rosalita, this is the attic.
Mr. Walsh doesn't like anyone up here.

129
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,313
That's why it's always open.

130
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:23,871
This is my supply closet. You'll
find brooms, dustpans, insect spray.

131
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:26,918
I'd like the house clean
when they tear it down.

132
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,832
Clark, can you translate?

133
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:42,429
Okay, Rosie? You're gonna be
very happy here.

134
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:46,559
Come on, Clark, we've got more to do.
You're so fluent in languages.

135
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:53,154
You're so fluent in Spanish.
That was so nice of you.

136
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,197
"Nice" is my middle name.

137
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:58,040
I'm taking Rosalita
to the supermarket.

138
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,037
I'll be back in about an hour.

139
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:05,308
Mikey, stay inside. Brand, if he has
asthma, I don't want him in the rain.

140
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,272
He should be in a plastic bubble.

141
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:09,636
I'm serious. That's not funny.

142
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:14,112
He takes one step outside, and you
are in absolutely the deepest...

143
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,315
Shit, Ma.

144
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,194
I don't like that language,
but that's what you'll be in.

145
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,311
- And you, Data...
- "Data."

146
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:23,120
- Use the back door from now on.
- All right.

147
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,634
What is that?

148
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,479
Oh, shit. What?

149
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,073
What is that?

150
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:33,310
That is a mess.
I want it cleaned up, boys.

151
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,068
- Oh, yeah. Sure!
- You got it.

152
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:39,274
One hour and I'll be back.
Bye, baby. Rosie?

153
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:41,351
- Bye, Mrs. Walsh.
- Bye.

154
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,715
You want a breathing problem?
You got one.

155
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:52,269
What'll happen to the stuff
in the attic?

156
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:54,238
My dad's giving it back
to the museum...

157
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:57,830
...or the new assistant curly...
Curney...

158
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,275
- Curator.
- Wait, guys.

159
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:04,036
Maybe there's stuff up there for us
that we can keep from the oldsiders.

160
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:06,316
Maybe there's some rich stuff!

161
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:11,354
No! It's my dad's responsibility,
you guys.

162
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:13,358
The museum's probably got a list.

163
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,556
Listen to me! That's his stuff!

164
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:24,876
Look at this. I didn't know Dad
had all this stuff up here.

165
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:29,150
- Great! Look at that! Neat!
- I love it.

166
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,789
Come on, guys!

167
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:34,235
My dad doesn't want you up here.

168
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:38,149
You heard what my mom said
about not wanting anybody up here.

169
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:42,598
I cannot believe you actually have
something this cool in your house.

170
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,034
You guys, my mom said...

171
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:46,350
Guys, stop. Put down
the outfit, okay?

172
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:49,996
This is great. We only have Hanukkah
decorations in our attic.

173
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,310
I don't care what you have in your...

174
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,278
Okay, you saw it, now let's go.

175
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,869
Come on, Mikey. It's cool!

176
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,680
I got you right where I want you!

177
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:07,959
It's dusty, my hay fever's acting up
and you always break something.

178
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,030
Mikey!

179
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,998
Come here and make me feel
like a woman.

180
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:13,629
Come on, give me a nice, wet,
lickery kiss.

181
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,353
I gotcha! Get out from there,
you're ruining the painting!

182
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:21,279
You're ruining my joke.
The painting's already cracked.

183
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,238
- Hey, Mikey?
- What?

184
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:29,953
What is all this stuff?

185
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,918
The museum did some...
Where'd you get this?

186
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,720
- Right there.
- They did a show. A retropactum.

187
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:38,316
- Retrospective.
- I said that. Don't contradict me.

188
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:42,673
It was about the history of Astoria,
and these are the rejects.

189
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,550
Kind of like us, the Goonies.

190
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:46,994
I'm not a reject.

191
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,750
Take that off.
You'll get me in trouble.

192
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,675
- You know how this works?
- What?

193
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,673
Laser beams!

194
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:59,756
Mouth, when you drop something,
put it back up...

195
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,715
What's this?

196
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:03,676
Wait a second.

197
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:19,756
Chunk!

198
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,276
I didn't touch it.

199
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:22,834
I know. Get over here.

200
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,356
Hold this.

201
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:31,073
Why me, Mike?

202
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:33,880
Thanks for taking us up here.
There's a real big ball...

203
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,479
...and it's got this thing...

204
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:42,794
What are you doing?

205
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:43,870
Mike found a map.

206
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,189
And look. That says "1632."

207
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:48,549
Is that a year?

208
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,756
No. It's your top score
on Pole Position.

209
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,753
Yes, it's a year.
It's a map of our coastline.

210
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,710
What's all that Spanish junk
right there?

211
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:59,599
Mouth, you said you can translate.
Translate.

212
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:00,795
Yeah, translate it.

213
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:05,915
"Ye intruders beware.

214
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,589
Crushing death and grief...

215
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:14,038
...soaked with blood
of the trespassing thief."

216
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:16,236
This map is old news.

217
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:20,678
Everybody went looking for that
when our parents were our age.

218
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,751
Haven't you heard of him?
What's his name?

219
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,230
The pirate guy. One-Eyed Willy.

220
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,717
One-Eyed Willy!

221
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:32,999
The most famous pirate in his time.
My dad told me all about him.

222
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:35,470
Dad'll do anything
to put you to sleep.

223
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:39,157
No! See, One-Eyed Willy
stole a treasure once.

224
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:42,119
And it was full of rubies
and emeralds...

225
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,236
And diamonds?

226
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:47,274
And diamonds. Then he loaded it
onto his ship...

227
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:49,511
...and sailed away into the sunset.

228
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:52,035
Until the British king found out
about it...

229
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:55,590
...and sent out his whole armada
to go after him.

230
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:59,355
It took them a couple of weeks
to catch up with Willy.

231
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,194
Then there was a whole big war...

232
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,677
...between the armada
and Willy's ship, the <i>Inferno.

233
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,638
During the firefight, there were...

234
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:10,519
...guns and cannons bursting
here and there.

235
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:14,912
Then Willy fled, because he knew
he'd get killed if he stayed around.

236
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:17,276
And then he got into this cave...

237
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:20,239
...and the British blew up
the walls around him.

238
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,948
He got caved in,
and he's been there ever since.

239
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,155
- Forever?
- Forever.

240
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,310
And ever?

241
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,074
Trapped.

242
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,111
You sound as corny as Dad does.

243
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,115
My dad tells the truth.
Know what he said?

244
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:38,114
He said One-Eyed Willy and his bunch
were down there for years.

245
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:41,193
They were digging tunnels and caves.

246
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:43,277
- Setting booty traps.
- Booby traps.

247
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:46,796
Setting booby traps so anybody who
tried to get in would die.

248
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,712
Then he killed all his men.

249
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,598
- Why?
- Why kill all of them?

250
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:52,432
So they wouldn't get his treasure.

251
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,272
Wait a minute.

252
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:57,677
If he killed all his men,
how did the map get out?

253
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:01,993
My dad said one of the guys must
have gotten out with the map.

254
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:06,069
- Hey, Mikey, I believe you.
- I don't believe you at all.

255
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,311
What did you break this time, Chunk?

256
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,671
Hey, you guys, look at this.

257
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,035
You ever hear of this guy?

258
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:18,714
Chester Copperpot.
Look what it says.

259
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:23,750
"Chester Copperpot, missing while
in pursuit of local legend.

260
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:28,158
Reclusive scavenger claims,
'I have the key...

261
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,597
...to One-Eyed Willy.'"

262
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:34,638
Wow, do you guys realize
what we could do?

263
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,919
Nobody ever found nothing.
Why would this map be in this attic...

264
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:41,799
...when it could be in some
safe-deposit box, right?

265
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:46,636
Right. If Chester Copperpot didn't
find it, how would we find it?

266
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:49,310
But what if? You guys...

267
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:53,832
...what if this map can lead
to One-Eyed Willy's rich stuff?

268
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,479
We wouldn't have to leave
the Goon Docks.

269
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:56,709
Come on, Mike.

270
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:00,236
I don't want to go on any more
of your Goonie adventures.

271
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:05,028
Where are you going?
You don't want to do this?

272
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,357
1632.

273
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:17,509
Jerk alert.

274
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:18,476
Can I help you?

275
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,792
Hello, little guys.
I'm Mr. Perkins, Troy's father.

276
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:24,235
We know Troy, he's a cheap guy.

277
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:25,953
My dad's not home, Mr. Perkins.

278
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,999
Is your mommy here?

279
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:32,188
No, she's down at the market buying
Pampers for all us kids.

280
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:35,508
Papers.

281
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:39,998
Well, you can give these papers to
your father to read through and sign.

282
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,756
We'll be by to pick them up
in the morning.

283
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,115
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

284
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,909
- What is that?
- It's Dad's business.

285
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,195
But what is it?

286
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,675
I told you it was Dad's business.

287
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,998
Look at them smiling.

288
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:02,833
They can't wait till tomorrow
to foreclose on whatever it's called.

289
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:04,479
Trash the Goon Docks.

290
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,631
I hope they make our house
a sand trap.

291
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,791
And never get their balls out.

292
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:13,597
You know, I think they made me
lose my appetite.

293
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:43,554
Come on, before you catch a real cold.

294
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:49,874
You're sure of yourself.

295
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:51,917
The foreclosure is a definite.

296
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,990
Oh, God, am I depressed.

297
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:03,678
If I found One-Eyed Willy's rich
stuff, I'd pay all my dad's bills.

298
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,876
Then he could sleep at night...

299
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:08,429
...instead of sitting up
figuring how we can stay.

300
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,159
- Me too.
- Me three.

301
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,799
Forget any adventures, limp lungs.

302
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:15,555
If I let you out, Mom will ground
me, and I've got a date with Andy.

303
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:18,473
You're dreaming, dude. No way.

304
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:22,474
Her mom has to drive, and then you
gotta make it with her and her mom.

305
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,312
- Shut up, Mouth.
- Yeah, Mouth.

306
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:26,118
Shut up, Data.

307
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:29,629
Jesus!

308
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:36,796
What'll we do about that country club?
It's killing our parents.

309
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:39,438
If we don't do something...

310
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:42,319
...there'll be a golf course
where we're standing.

311
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:21,710
Brand, how far can you stretch that?

312
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:23,791
It's not that hard.

313
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,269
Get off me, Chunk.

314
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,869
- Get off me!
- I got you.

315
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:39,590
What are you doing?

316
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,878
It took his 376 lawn mowing jobs
to pay for it.

317
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,553
It's his favorite thing in the world.

318
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,711
Now it's his flattest.
Let's go!

319
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:50,794
I'll hit you so hard, when you wake
your clothes will be out of style!

320
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:12,029
Mom. You've got to let me
out of here.

321
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:15,832
Can't you learn how to exercise
like a normal kid?

322
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:20,596
Look! You're hyperventrilicating.
Where's your brother?

323
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:22,308
Mom!

324
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:24,039
What's wrong with you people?

325
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:25,474
Rosalita, come here.

326
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:27,950
You gotta let me out of here.
Rosalita!

327
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:33,312
Rosalita, come here.
You gotta let me out of this.

328
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:41,152
- Hi, Mikey.
- Hi, Dad!

329
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,277
Hey, wait for me!

330
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:54,037
If you don't bring your brother home,
I'll commit Hare Krishna!

331
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:55,599
That's hara-kiri, Ma.

332
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:58,877
- That's exactly what I said.
- What?

333
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:03,113
My new tires!
They popped my new tires, the son of...

334
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:04,589
I'm gonna kill...

335
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:10,511
- My bike! My bike!
- I owe you one.

336
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:12,512
He's got my bike! I want my bike!

337
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:18,438
Gold Rock Beach is around
this next curve.

338
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:20,671
I have a feeling about this.

339
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:24,037
Every time you have feeling,
we get in trouble.

340
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:27,556
You're the one who always gets us
in trouble, 00-Negative.

341
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,677
I'm James Bond, 007, not 00-Negative.

342
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:33,356
I'm hungry. When my stomach growls,
there's trouble.

343
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:34,629
Shut up, Chunk!

344
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:40,315
You made me go up this big
hill and said give me a Twinkie.

345
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:43,068
I'll be late for dinner,
and my mom'll yell at me.

346
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:47,199
She's not gonna let me eat dinner,
and she's gonna punish me!

347
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:51,877
Anybody got a candy bar?
A Baby Ruth?

348
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,515
I can't believe it. That's it.

349
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:59,354
Those three rocks out there.
One, two, three.

350
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:16,800
Troy! You touch that mirror again,
and I'll smack you in the face.

351
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:19,429
There's Brand.

352
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:21,272
Like the bike.

353
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:22,919
What is he doing?

354
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,991
No wonder he can't get a license.

355
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,359
Oh, no.

356
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:37,158
Brand, can we give you
a ride somewhere?

357
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,789
No. Thanks anyway.

358
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:43,230
Walsh, let us give you a little ride.

359
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,831
Hold on. Here we go!

360
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:48,232
- Troy!
- Let go of my arm!

361
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:52,356
Oh, no.

362
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:59,469
Let go of my hand!

363
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:02,149
Oh, my God!

364
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,913
So long, sucker!

365
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:19,032
- Forget it!
- Come on!

366
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:23,958
- This better be it, Mikey.
- Shut up, Chunk.

367
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:29,556
Guys?

368
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,629
I think I have a match.
I'm sure of it.

369
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:38,873
The lighthouse, the rock and
the restaurant all fit the doubloon.

370
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:42,950
That must mean the rich stuff
is near the restaurant.

371
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:44,793
Wait a second.

372
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:48,954
Mouth, I need you to translate.
I don't understand Spanish.

373
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:51,517
- Right here.
- All right, all right.

374
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:55,876
- What's that?
- 10 times 10.

375
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:56,950
A hundred.

376
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,315
"Stretching feet...

377
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:01,154
...to nearest northern point."

378
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:04,949
- Which way is north?
- "That's where you'll find the treat."

379
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:08,836
That's it!

380
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:10,035
- That's north.
- Near the restaurant.

381
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:16,238
One, two, three, four,
five...

382
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:19,677
...six, seven, eight, nine...

383
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,351
Wait a minute. Somebody's there.

384
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:37,110
Sixty and another 40 is an even 100.

385
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:40,033
Right to the restaurant.
The rich stuff is there.

386
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:42,669
I don't know about it, Mikey.

387
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:45,359
It's getting late.

388
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:48,637
That's a summer place.
Why is it open in the fall?

389
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:53,510
There's nothing to be scared of.
Two customers went inside the place.

390
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:56,832
What if they're not customers?
What if they're drug dealers?

391
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:58,877
Drug dealers?

392
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:04,956
Did you see their clothes? Drug
dealers don't wear polyester rags.

393
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:11,554
Mikey, Mikey!
That sounded like gunshots.

394
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:16,032
Not the kind you hear in movies,
but real ones. They're gonna kill us.

395
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:19,192
Turn off your brain.
Somebody dropped a pot.

396
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:20,310
Yeah, a pot!

397
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:25,316
Are you sure, Mikey?
Because if you're sure, I'm sure.

398
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:28,831
If it's not the pots,
they might try to kill us.

399
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:31,678
They're gonna kill us!

400
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:35,111
Chunk, shut up!

401
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:47,837
Soda pop! Boy, am I thirsty!

402
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:49,350
Damn it!

403
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:50,909
What's that?

404
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:52,832
Come on, hurry up! Hurry up!

405
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:57,196
The cook is carrying something
to the kitchen.

406
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:59,038
Yeah, food.

407
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:00,469
Don't let them see us.

408
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,473
ORV.

409
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:13,669
Bullet holes.

410
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:16,753
Bullet holes?!

411
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:25,033
Shut up, Chunk.

412
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:32,594
This is a summer restaurant? I bet
it hasn't been open in 10 summers.

413
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:35,639
How long you boys been at that window?

414
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:40,033
Long enough to see you need about
400 roach motels in this place.

415
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:44,955
How am I supposed to create
with that Smithsonian piece of shit?!

416
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:56,952
Jake, these boys are customers.

417
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:10,509
Boys...

418
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:14,077
...make yourselves comfortable, huh?

419
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:19,592
She's gonna cook you something.

420
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,599
What do you want?

421
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,831
- Lots of water.
- Water, water, water.

422
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:27,640
Four waters. Is that all?

423
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,114
No.

424
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:31,550
I want veal scallopini.

425
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:34,360
I want a good fettucini Alfredo.

426
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:38,595
A bottle of fettucine, 1981.

427
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,629
The only thing we serve is tongue.

428
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,752
You boys like tongue?

429
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:55,675
That's all?

430
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,029
Sit down!

431
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:04,919
Are you all right, Chunk?

432
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:07,919
Hey, guys.

433
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:12,229
What happened to the two guys
in the polyester who came before us?

434
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:15,159
- What happened to them?
- What is it? Spit it out.

435
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:17,595
You guys, if we don't
get out of here soon...

436
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:20,912
...there's gonna be
some kind of hostage crisis.

437
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:26,310
Out in the garage, ORV,
four-wheel drive...

438
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:28,556
...bullet holes the size of matzo ba...

439
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:32,713
Chunk, I'm starting to O.D.
On all your bullshit stories.

440
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:35,356
Here's your water.

441
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:37,676
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you, ma'am.

442
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:38,910
I mean "ma'am."

443
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:40,718
This is supposed to be water?

444
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,757
It's wet, isn't it? Drink it!

445
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,592
Where's the men's room, please?

446
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:46,353
- Can't you hold it?
- No.

447
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:50,479
Mikey, this ain't the kind of place
you want to go to the bathroom in.

448
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:52,359
Why not?

449
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:55,109
Because they might have
daddy longlegs in them.

450
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:58,238
- But I gotta go to the bathroom.
- Like dead things, Mikey.

451
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:01,353
Hey, Mikey, gotta go to the bathroom?

452
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:04,273
- Killer dead things. Big. Please.
- Lady, please!

453
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:07,080
- Downstairs, first door on the right.
- Thank you.

454
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:10,073
- Stay to the right!
- Please, Mikey, dead things.

455
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:11,719
Stay to the right!

456
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:14,275
I know it's to the right, thank you.

457
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:22,270
I know you're down here,
One-Eyed Willy. You've gotta be.

458
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:26,278
I can feel it, One-Eyed Willy.
I know you're down here.

459
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:31,835
Oh, man, that stinks.

460
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,879
What the hell is that?

461
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:57,273
You're ruining it!
Look at the feast I made you.

462
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:59,869
Look at the feast I made you.
Want to eat it?

463
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:04,193
Have some. You'll get something.
You don't leave me any choice.

464
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:05,993
You don't leave me any choice!

465
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:11,672
You're just like Mom and Francis.
You never let me finish.

466
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:03,439
Why can't you stay at home?
I'm taking you out of here right now.

467
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:05,033
Let's get out of here!

468
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:07,633
Get out of here!

469
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:10,833
And stay out!

470
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:20,039
Kids suck.

471
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:24,828
I swear on my life, they've got it.

472
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:28,038
An It! A giant It!
They got it chained to the wall!

473
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:30,840
It came into the light
gross and distorted.

474
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:34,956
Like your brain, right?
Say goodbye.

475
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:35,830
Hey, look at that.

476
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,748
- Ma, why'd you have to shoot him?
- He's a fed.

477
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,629
We could've taken him to the side
of a road and shot him in the brain.

478
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:47,111
- Bring him over here, Francis.
- Don't give me "over here."

479
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:49,790
I'm wondering, what is in the bag?

480
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:51,553
Restaurant trash. Yeah.

481
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:54,360
You sure? That big? That much?

482
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:57,552
There were bullet holes
in the car this big.

483
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:00,360
Mikey, come on,
our parents are worried.

484
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:05,151
- It's dinnertime. Let's go home.
- Home? What home?

485
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:08,312
In a couple more hours
it ain't gonna be home anymore.

486
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:11,194
Come on, guys, this is our time.

487
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:14,472
Our last chance to see
if there really is any rich stuff.

488
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:17,954
We've got to.

489
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:21,479
Get down, guys. Get down.

490
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:27,512
Oh, shit!

491
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:30,877
You guys scared me!
Almost gave me a heart attack!

492
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:35,033
- You look better from behind, Mouth.
- Want to see something really scary?

493
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,077
How did you get here?

494
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:40,756
We followed you guys.
We were out driving with Troy.

495
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:44,391
- Sorry about your face.
- It's okay, I was born with it.

496
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:47,598
- I'm kidding.
- Anyway, he was being a jerk.

497
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:50,798
Tilting the mirror
so he could look down my shirt.

498
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:54,237
- So I elbowed his lip.
- You elbowed his lip?

499
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:57,432
- It's locked.
- Thank God!

500
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:58,590
Wait a minute!

501
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:02,310
You know, I got some naked pictures
of your mom, taking a bath.

502
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:04,399
- Want to buy them?
- What?!

503
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:06,153
Real cheap.

504
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:10,879
Thanks, Chunk.

505
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:16,352
- Wait here. I'll get my brother.
- You'll get in trouble.

506
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:19,632
- Just don't leave, all right?
- No way I'm staying here.

507
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:26,592
Shut up! We got to get
to the lowest point of the floor.

508
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:29,035
Lowest point, nothing.
Let's go. Now!

509
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:33,356
Oh, my God!

510
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:36,432
- No, Brandon.
- Mikey!

511
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:46,636
- Oh, my God.
- It was disgusting.

512
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:49,917
It jumped out from the bushes.
I swear it almost killed us.

513
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:53,630
Please? What if we find something?
A few more minutes won't hurt.

514
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:55,757
Come on, Mikey, we're going now.

515
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,549
- Brand, give them a few minutes.
- Listen to your big brother.

516
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:02,268
As long as you stay here with me.

517
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:06,630
- She knows what she's talking about.
- She's a dame!

518
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,275
Chunk, I hope that was your stomach.

519
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:24,433
That's the It.

520
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:26,792
Sounds like Kong.

521
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:28,878
Part of it's human.

522
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:31,555
Come on. Want to see it?

523
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:34,600
Don't worry.
It's chained to the wall.

524
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:53,715
- I don't want to go.
- Why not? It's chained.

525
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:56,315
- Why not? It's chained.
- You wanted to go.

526
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:58,596
- Yeah, I wanted to go.
- So let's go.

527
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:02,111
I don't want to see it.

528
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:22,273
- Shame, shame!
- I know your name.

529
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,596
Come on, Brand, slip her the tongue.

530
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:27,513
That's disgusting.
No, I can't even look.

531
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:30,270
Get me up, guys!

532
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:33,120
One, two, three.

533
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:34,789
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

534
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:38,874
Can't you smell it, guys?
One-Eyed Willy really is down here.

535
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,672
We're walking right above...

536
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:44,354
I'm gonna build one like this one.

537
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:45,874
Water.

538
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:49,189
- Come on, we can do it.
- No, wait a minute.

539
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:54,316
Right about here must've been when we
said we gotta get to the lowest spot.

540
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:57,348
What are you two talking
to each other about, Mikey?

541
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:01,670
What the hell are you doing?
You're going to lose your fist!

542
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:04,070
What are you doing? Give me that.

543
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:07,357
There's nothing buried there.
This is the 20th century!

544
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:10,433
- The map says there is.
- Get off it! There's nothing...

545
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:12,432
Lookit! I got an idea.

546
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:16,275
Let's put chocolate all over the floor
and let Chunk eat through it.

547
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:19,751
Okay, Mouth, that's all I can stand.

548
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,470
And I can't stand no more!
I got it! I got it! I got it!

549
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:27,474
- I don't got it.
- You klutz.

550
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:29,552
Hope it's not a deposit bottle.

551
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,279
This is ridiculous.

552
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:34,711
I feel like I'm babysitting,
except I'm not getting paid.

553
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:36,879
- Listen to that.
- What?

554
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:44,117
Sounds like my grandfather
taking a leak. Thrillsville.

555
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:45,509
No, it's deep.

556
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:49,753
Like there's a hole
or a passageway. Real deep.

557
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:51,469
Get out of the way.

558
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:53,918
Brand is being so sweet.

559
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:58,590
You're in the clouds,
and we are in a basement!

560
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:05,236
I told you!

561
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:06,999
Told you! I told you!

562
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:12,712
I can feel the air.
There's something down there.

563
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:14,791
It might be a treasure or something.

564
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,638
Hey, this is working, guys.

565
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:24,515
- Brand, careful!
- Are you okay?

566
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:26,751
I told you there was a passageway.

567
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:29,753
- It's the start of the tunnel.
- Look.

568
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:42,319
$50 bill.

569
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:44,158
$50 bill. $50 bill?

570
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:46,629
Did he say, "$50 bill"?

571
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,677
$50 bills!
Hundreds of them!

572
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:53,439
We have money to save the Goon Docks!

573
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:01,789
Quiet!

574
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:04,635
They're fake. They're bogus.
They're phony.

575
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:07,440
I knew these people
were from the ozone.

576
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:10,592
You get 25 years for counterfeiting!

577
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:13,838
- I recognize these people.
- Look, it's the Fratellis.

578
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:16,548
- He was upstairs!
- The guy who tried to sing.

579
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,518
You guys never listen to me.

580
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:21,718
I said there would be trouble,
but you didn't listen.

581
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:24,997
You guys are crazy.
You guys are self-destructive.

582
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:28,232
There's a funny farm
with your names written all over it.

583
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:30,596
But I'm getting out of here. But...

584
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:33,838
I smell ice cream.

585
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:38,148
They got Swenson's.

586
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:41,912
They got Pralines and Cream.
And they got Mississippi Mud.

587
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:44,071
And they got Chocolate Eruption!

588
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:46,836
And they got apple!

589
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:48,548
And they got grape!

590
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:52,429
They got grape and Super-Duper
Chocolate Eruption and...

591
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:53,829
What, what?

592
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:05,959
It's a stiff!

593
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:11,109
The door!

594
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:27,269
- Somebody's been here. Door's open.
- Shut it.

595
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:29,994
- I'm gonna leave the lights on.
- Calm down.

596
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:36,239
Pizza.

597
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:39,119
Pepperoni.

598
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:43,717
- Ma, he's eating my pepperoni again.
- You want your pepperoni?

599
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:47,670
Let's kill each other
over the pepperoni.

600
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:50,593
Put that gun away now!

601
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:52,718
You always take his side.

602
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:54,075
That's right.

603
00:42:58,480 --> 00:42:59,595
Put him back.

604
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:08,188
- Okay, close the door.
- We can go, guys.

605
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:13,191
Mikey? Mikey, come on.

606
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:16,437
The fireplace is the only way out.

607
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:19,478
- You guys will never get out that way.
- What?

608
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:25,356
It all starts here.

609
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:34,830
Guys, I'm stuck with the stiff!

610
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:39,435
Stay. Stay.

611
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:42,433
Guys, come here!
He's in here! Oh, shit.

612
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:44,875
- Come on, let's go.
- Faster, guys.

613
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:50,108
- Half the pepperoni was mine.
- Okay, I'm sorry.

614
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:53,352
Help! Help! Help! Guys!

615
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:56,433
- Come on, you idiots!
- Okay, Ma.

616
00:43:57,720 --> 00:44:00,075
- I'll make sure it's safe.
- Shut up.

617
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:02,595
- Safe.
- Shut up and go.

618
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:04,159
Hurry up!

619
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:09,838
I'm not kidding! Look in the window!

620
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:19,198
I'll show you that piece that...

621
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:21,949
He says that all the time.
Watch your head, Ma.

622
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:24,156
- I can't find Chunk.
- Where's Chunk?

623
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:28,555
- Where's Chunk?
- Chunk's up there.

624
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:32,233
- Look at this piece over here.
- Leave it alone, Jake.

625
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:35,877
Ma, I don't want him to touch it.
I worked two hours on it...

626
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:38,156
- You worked one.
- Shut up!

627
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:42,989
Someone's been here. The cooler's
broken. Go check your brother.

628
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:46,232
- It could've been a tremor, Ma.
- I'll show you a tremor.

629
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:49,319
I'll go check the brother.

630
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:52,910
If he broke his chains, I'm not
getting any more from the zoo.

631
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:55,276
- Ma, just don't upset yourself.
- Hurry up!

632
00:44:57,880 --> 00:44:59,074
<i>Gesundheit.

633
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:04,719
I'm cold.

634
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,434
Chunk. Chunk, come here.

635
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:13,031
What are you doing down there?

636
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:17,629
Go get the police.

637
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:20,952
We're in serious shit here.
You gotta get the police.

638
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:22,553
Don't worry, I can do it.

639
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:24,917
Go, get out of here.

640
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:30,313
Watch it... Oh, the window.

641
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:36,551
- Did you see him, guys?
- Where's Chunk?

642
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:39,712
- He went to get the police.
- Go, the Fratellis are there.

643
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:41,712
He's getting the police. Move!

644
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:44,190
See, Ma?
There was nothing to worry about.

645
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:47,392
I knew he couldn't break them chains.

646
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:48,595
Get the body.

647
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:52,513
We've been walking forever.
How much further is it?

648
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:54,352
Mouth, you stepped on my foot.

649
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:57,034
Now I dropped my glasses.
I can't see a thing.

650
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:58,633
Oh, my God.

651
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:01,189
- I found your glasses. Sorry.
- You broke them.

652
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:03,198
You broke my glasses!

653
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:07,029
Listen, I'm the oldest,
so I'm in charge. First, we'll...

654
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:09,197
Data, do you have a light?

655
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:12,631
I said I was in charge.
Data, do you have a light?

656
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:16,911
Sure, guys. Back up, back up.

657
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:20,157
Bully Blinders!

658
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:23,478
- All right, Data... Ow!
- Isn't that neat?

659
00:46:23,720 --> 00:46:28,191
One day I was walking home with it,
and two big guys stopped me...

660
00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:32,149
Who is that? Oh, Stef, that's you.
Watch out. Data!

661
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:33,594
Come on, turn it off.

662
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:38,595
Oh, Data. The only problem is
the batteries don't last so long.

663
00:46:39,080 --> 00:46:43,471
There's a light up ahead. Maybe we
can get out that way. Let's go.

664
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:47,435
I'm not afraid of the dark.
I like the dark. I love it.

665
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:50,672
But I hate nature. I hate nature!

666
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:53,508
Wait a sec! Hold it!

667
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:56,268
Stop! I'm just a kid!

668
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:01,793
- What seems to be the problem?
- Mister, I need a ride.

669
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:04,838
My friends and I had
a run-in with disgusting people.

670
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:08,629
You might've heard of them, the
Fratellis. We found their hideout.

671
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:13,670
Could you take me to the sheriff?
I can describe all three of them.

672
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:37,349
Will you...

673
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:43,956
What the hell? He's only a kid.
Can't you handle a kid, even?

674
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:48,469
- Does it work, guys?
- Yeah!

675
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:54,071
I can't see. Mouth, your father's
a plumber. What are these pipes?

676
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:57,034
These look like water pipes, guys.

677
00:47:57,280 --> 00:47:58,838
Gas pipes.

678
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:03,509
Drainage. Maybe... Wait a minute.
Shut up for a minute!

679
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:07,912
These pipes must lead to a building
or something. A foundation.

680
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:11,994
So maybe if we bang on them hard
enough, if we make enough noise...

681
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:47,599
How are you, Duke?

682
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:49,717
- Hey, Gene, how are you?
- Great.

683
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:22,317
Reverse pressure!

684
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:29,629
Daddy!

685
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:30,790
- Let's...
- Get out of...

686
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:32,792
- Here!
- Like now!

687
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:36,873
Go, go, go!

688
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:56,555
First, we start with
the pudgy little fingers.

689
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:59,109
Then the plump little hands.

690
00:49:59,360 --> 00:50:01,669
Then the fleshy arms.

691
00:50:03,560 --> 00:50:05,596
Now, tell me where your friends are.

692
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:06,750
In the fireplace.

693
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,035
Don't lie to me!

694
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:11,750
Honestly. We found a map
over at Mikey's dad's place...

695
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,958
...that said there was
buried treasure under here.

696
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:17,794
Don't give us none of
your bullshit stories, huh?

697
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:21,149
Spill your guts. Tell us everything.

698
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:22,628
Everything?

699
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:24,070
Everything.

700
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:27,960
Okay, I'll talk.

701
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:31,433
In 3rd grade,
I cheated on my history exam.

702
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:35,070
In 4th grade, I stole my uncle's
toupee and glued it on my face...

703
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:37,595
...when I played Moses
in my Hebrew school play.

704
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:42,470
In 5th grade, I knocked my sister
down the stairs, and I blamed our dog.

705
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:46,758
Wait, I can't see a thing.
What am I stepping on?

706
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:47,876
Oh, brother.

707
00:50:48,120 --> 00:50:51,715
Look, a lantern. Somebody must
have been here before us.

708
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:53,916
- Maybe they're still here.
- I hope not.

709
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:55,593
Look at these cigarettes.

710
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:05,151
Ten minutes ago, Troy was looking down
my shirt. Who cares? It's not wrong.

711
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:07,595
If I'd been smart,
he'd still be looking.

712
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:09,876
- Listen to her.
- What's wrong with her?

713
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:12,435
- Andy, it's okay.
- Is she all right?

714
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:20,836
I should've let him look at my body.
Don't I have a beautiful body?

715
00:51:21,080 --> 00:51:22,559
You've got a great body.

716
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:26,429
How many years do I have before I
get fat? Before my hair falls out?

717
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:28,477
Before I look like him?

718
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:36,752
Then my mom sent me
to a summer camp for fat kids.

719
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:40,151
Then, once during lunch, I got nuts
and I pigged out...

720
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:41,628
...and they kicked me out!

721
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:47,629
- Look at him.
- Don't touch it, guys.

722
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:52,033
This is one of your tricks,
right, One-Eyed Willy?

723
00:51:54,680 --> 00:51:58,468
You must be really hiding something
to go through all this trouble.

724
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:01,792
- There's nothing to worry about.
- You don't understand!

725
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:03,234
Don't be afraid.

726
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:09,795
He's dead for sure.
I think he's Chester Copperpot.

727
00:52:10,040 --> 00:52:11,268
- Chester who?
- Who?

728
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:14,592
Don't you remember from the attic?
The news article?

729
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:17,195
The last guy to look
for the rich stuff...

730
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:20,233
...he went in,
but he never came back out.

731
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:22,436
That was back in 1935.

732
00:52:22,680 --> 00:52:26,878
Oh, God. If he didn't make it out
and he was an expert, what about us?

733
00:52:27,120 --> 00:52:28,553
How will we get out?

734
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:31,030
- Don't worry about it. Calm down.
- You sure?

735
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:33,669
- I'm positive.
- How will we get out?

736
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:35,752
We can't be sure it's him.

737
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:36,955
I know it's him.

738
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:40,112
I bet his I.D. Is in his wallet.
Mouth, get his wallet.

739
00:52:42,680 --> 00:52:43,999
Lou Gehrig?

740
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:47,632
- You get it, Mikey!
- Mikey, get it.

741
00:52:53,560 --> 00:52:55,710
It is Chester Copperpot.

742
00:52:56,800 --> 00:52:59,189
- Oh, God. Come on.
- You see? I told you.

743
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:01,471
We're gonna get killed too.

744
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:03,439
Hey, look at this.

745
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:04,829
Candles.

746
00:53:07,840 --> 00:53:10,832
- They're gonna kill us. We're dead.
- Where are you going?

747
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:13,391
- I'm setting booty traps.
- Booby traps.

748
00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:17,269
That's what I said. I'll set booby
traps in case anyone follows us...

749
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:19,715
...like the Fratellis.
We'll hear them coming.

750
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:21,518
- Okay, hurry up.
- Good idea.

751
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:23,830
- Where you going?
- To set booty traps.

752
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:27,629
- You mean booby traps.
- That's what I said. Booby traps!

753
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:29,632
God, these guys...

754
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:37,151
Guys, look. It looks like a skeleton
of One-Eyed Willy or something.

755
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:39,231
Give me that. Give me this thing.

756
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:48,229
Oh, God! There's no way out of here.

757
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:50,312
No, don't, don't, don't, Brandon.

758
00:53:52,760 --> 00:53:54,557
Hey, guys, now that we've got...

759
00:53:58,280 --> 00:54:00,510
Look at this. See what I found?

760
00:54:11,560 --> 00:54:13,073
Guys, freeze. Don't move.

761
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:16,676
Don't move. You guys,
don't move back there! Don't move!

762
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:18,433
- What?
- Freeze!

763
00:54:22,120 --> 00:54:23,792
Run, you guys, run!

764
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:30,997
Holy shit!

765
00:54:54,680 --> 00:54:56,272
Man, that was close.

766
00:54:56,560 --> 00:54:59,154
Wait, listen. Sounds like
somebody's down there.

767
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:08,749
Shut up and listen.

768
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,195
- Maybe it's a way out.
- Or the Fratellis.

769
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:15,035
- Or Chunk got the police.
- Or one of Willy's booby traps.

770
00:55:19,640 --> 00:55:22,234
God put that rock there for a purpose.

771
00:55:22,520 --> 00:55:25,592
I'm not so sure you should
move it or anything.

772
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:28,629
Hello?

773
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:33,595
Bats!

774
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:42,199
Save me! They're in my hair.

775
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:44,630
Help! Rabies! Rabies!

776
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:49,229
Rabies! We're gonna get rabies!

777
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:55,031
But the worst thing I ever done,
I mixed up fake puke at home...

778
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:59,671
...and I went to this movie theater,
hid the puke in my jacket...

779
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:02,388
...climbed up to the balcony...

780
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:05,393
...and then I made a noise like this...

781
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:16,675
And then I dumped it over the side...

782
00:56:17,320 --> 00:56:19,914
...on all the people
in the audience. Then...

783
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:22,116
Then this was horrible.

784
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:26,678
All the people started getting sick
and throwing up on each other.

785
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:29,753
I never felt so bad in my entire life.

786
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:31,638
I'm beginning to like him, Ma.

787
00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:33,233
Hit puree.

788
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:35,199
No, I'm too young!

789
00:56:35,960 --> 00:56:38,554
No! I want to play the violin!

790
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:40,916
- Not my hand!
- Do I get the truth?

791
00:56:41,480 --> 00:56:44,233
Do I get the truth,
or do you get juiced?

792
00:56:46,200 --> 00:56:48,430
- What was that noise?
- Fireplace blew.

793
00:56:48,680 --> 00:56:51,990
The kid's not kidding, Ma.
There's a tunnel down there.

794
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:56,512
Watch your hair!
They're going for the hair!

795
00:56:57,840 --> 00:56:58,875
Watch your veins, Ma!

796
00:56:59,120 --> 00:57:02,795
Hey, Mikey, if you can hear me, run!

797
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:05,076
Run! They're coming after you!

798
00:57:05,840 --> 00:57:09,389
Hey, if we keep going this
far down, we'll reach China.

799
00:57:09,640 --> 00:57:12,029
Maybe I can go see
my auntie or something.

800
00:57:14,440 --> 00:57:16,271
This could get dangerous, Andy.

801
00:57:16,560 --> 00:57:18,710
- You might want to hold my hand.
- Thank you.

802
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:22,995
- Oh, wow!
- Oh, neat!

803
00:57:23,240 --> 00:57:25,959
- That's beautiful.
- Look, a waterfall!

804
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:56,397
- Wow! It's a giant piggy bank!
- We're rich!

805
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:57,550
We found it!

806
00:57:57,800 --> 00:58:01,349
- Gold and silver all over the place!
- It's gold, we did it!

807
00:58:01,640 --> 00:58:02,789
Hold the lantern.

808
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:05,198
Coins! Rich stuff.

809
00:58:05,840 --> 00:58:07,512
What year was the map made?

810
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:08,636
I don't know.

811
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:12,873
Probably a couple hundred years
before President Lincoln.

812
00:58:13,840 --> 00:58:15,239
George Washington.

813
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:20,633
- Martin Sheen.
- That's President Kennedy, you idiot!

814
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:23,917
Well, same difference! I mean,
he played Kennedy once.

815
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:26,628
That's smart. I'm glad
you're using your brain.

816
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:29,997
- At least I have a brain!
- You're so stupid, Mouth.

817
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:31,753
- Oh, yeah?
- Yes.

818
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:34,836
Shut up! Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

819
00:58:35,080 --> 00:58:38,197
This isn't gold. This is
a wishing well. Look.

820
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:41,153
Hey, it must be the old
Moss Garden wishing well.

821
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:45,996
I used to believe when you threw
money in, it turned into your wish.

822
00:58:46,320 --> 00:58:48,675
- I'll take two of your coins.
- That's not fair.

823
00:58:48,920 --> 00:58:53,630
- Wait, wait, wait, you can't do this.
- Why?

824
00:58:53,880 --> 00:58:56,030
Because these are
somebody else's wishes.

825
00:58:56,280 --> 00:58:58,555
They're somebody else's dreams.

826
00:59:00,280 --> 00:59:02,748
Yeah, but you know what?

827
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:06,239
This one, this one right here...

828
00:59:06,520 --> 00:59:08,954
...this was my dream, my wish.

829
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:12,795
And it didn't come true.
So I'm taking it back.

830
00:59:13,080 --> 00:59:14,957
I'm taking them all back.

831
00:59:18,120 --> 00:59:21,635
Come on, One-Eyed Willy, what does
this have to do with the map?

832
00:59:21,880 --> 00:59:24,075
Is this another one of your tricks?

833
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:27,119
Maybe we should keep him alive
in case he isn't lying.

834
00:59:27,360 --> 00:59:30,716
Good idea, Jake. Put him in
with your brother.

835
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:31,870
Okay, Ma.

836
00:59:32,600 --> 00:59:33,715
Come on, kid.

837
00:59:35,840 --> 00:59:38,991
- You dropped something.
- What's that, a Cracker Jack prize?

838
00:59:41,120 --> 00:59:42,838
- Shit!
- We found it on the map.

839
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:45,310
It has to do with the treasure.

840
00:59:45,560 --> 00:59:47,869
Jake, look at the date on it.

841
00:59:48,120 --> 00:59:50,111
This is an authentic doubloon.

842
00:59:50,360 --> 00:59:51,873
Give it to me.

843
00:59:52,120 --> 00:59:53,519
I told you so.

844
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:58,550
See, you guys? You never believed me.
I said there was gonna be buried...

845
01:00:03,320 --> 01:00:05,880
Troy, how far you got with Andy?

846
01:00:06,080 --> 01:00:07,638
All the way, buddy?

847
01:00:08,120 --> 01:00:10,190
You guys are so immature. Grow up.

848
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:12,869
- Come on, tell us.
- Really.

849
01:00:13,120 --> 01:00:15,759
Put it this way:
I didn't make it with her yet.

850
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:17,911
And I stress "yet."

851
01:00:21,720 --> 01:00:22,630
What the hell?

852
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:26,350
- What'd you wish for?
- To make it with Andy.

853
01:00:30,520 --> 01:00:32,317
Hey, who's down there?

854
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:35,118
Hey, guys, it's Troy!

855
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:38,269
Sounds like Andy.

856
01:00:38,560 --> 01:00:39,754
Andy!

857
01:00:40,560 --> 01:00:41,515
Is that you?

858
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:45,309
Yeah, it's me. We're stuck down here.
Please send down the bucket.

859
01:00:45,560 --> 01:00:48,313
What the hell are you doing
at the bottom of a well?

860
01:00:48,600 --> 01:00:53,310
Don't ask stupid questions! We're
stuck! Just send down the bucket!

861
01:00:54,200 --> 01:00:57,556
See, guys? Wishes do come true.

862
01:00:58,680 --> 01:01:00,750
<i>All right, my hearties, follow me!

863
01:01:06,680 --> 01:01:08,671
Don't worry. I brought you more food.

864
01:01:08,920 --> 01:01:10,911
Why are you locking me in here?

865
01:01:11,160 --> 01:01:13,196
- You're not too tight.
- Yes, it is.

866
01:01:13,480 --> 01:01:15,675
If you get out, I'll break your legs.

867
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:18,036
What are you doing?

868
01:01:18,280 --> 01:01:20,874
If you sit too close to the TV,
you'll screw up your eye.

869
01:01:21,960 --> 01:01:23,632
Jake, leave him alone!

870
01:01:29,640 --> 01:01:31,278
Come on! Let me out.

871
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:43,674
Hi, sir. My name's Lawrence.

872
01:01:43,960 --> 01:01:46,428
Sometimes people call me Chunk.

873
01:01:56,600 --> 01:01:58,591
Help! Let me out of here!

874
01:01:58,920 --> 01:02:00,319
Who knows what we'll find.

875
01:02:00,600 --> 01:02:01,715
Okay, let's go.

876
01:02:01,960 --> 01:02:05,589
Whoa, look at this.
Look how deep it is down there.

877
01:02:05,840 --> 01:02:06,909
Jake, you first.

878
01:02:07,160 --> 01:02:08,798
I ain't gonna go first.

879
01:02:09,040 --> 01:02:11,998
- Go!
- Can't argue with that, Ma, all right.

880
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:13,958
Troy, throw the bucket down.

881
01:02:15,320 --> 01:02:18,039
Hey, you guys, I'm the smallest.
I want to go first.

882
01:02:18,280 --> 01:02:22,671
Get out! I'm the oldest, so I call
the shots. Andy goes first.

883
01:02:22,920 --> 01:02:24,512
Chester Copperpot.

884
01:02:24,760 --> 01:02:26,557
Chester Copperpot.

885
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:28,228
Chester Copperpot!

886
01:02:29,360 --> 01:02:30,270
Don't you see?

887
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:34,714
Don't you realize? He was a pro!
He never made it this far.

888
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:37,838
Look how far we've come.
We've got a chance.

889
01:02:38,280 --> 01:02:40,919
Chance at what, Mikey?
Getting killed?

890
01:02:41,160 --> 01:02:45,915
Look, if we keep going, someone's
really gonna get hurt. Maybe dead.

891
01:02:46,240 --> 01:02:47,719
We've got to get the police.

892
01:02:47,960 --> 01:02:49,473
Maybe Chunk got the police.

893
01:02:49,800 --> 01:02:50,789
Maybe Chunk is dead.

894
01:02:51,040 --> 01:02:55,158
Don't say that. Never say that.
Goonies never say "die"!

895
01:02:56,280 --> 01:02:59,750
I'm not a Goonie. I want to go home.

896
01:03:01,800 --> 01:03:04,519
I forgot. But still!

897
01:03:05,120 --> 01:03:08,908
Don't you realize?
The next time you see the sky...

898
01:03:10,080 --> 01:03:12,071
...it'll be over another town.

899
01:03:13,040 --> 01:03:15,110
The next time we take a test...

900
01:03:16,760 --> 01:03:19,593
...it'll be in some other school.

901
01:03:21,080 --> 01:03:24,755
Our parents, they want
the best of stuff for us.

902
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:27,990
Now they got to do
what's right for them.

903
01:03:28,240 --> 01:03:31,038
Because it's their time. Their time!

904
01:03:31,600 --> 01:03:32,510
Up there.

905
01:03:33,240 --> 01:03:37,313
Down here it's our time.
It's our time down here.

906
01:03:38,560 --> 01:03:42,519
That's all over the second
we ride up Troy's bucket.

907
01:04:22,200 --> 01:04:23,758
Andy!

908
01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:26,516
You Goonie!

909
01:04:27,640 --> 01:04:28,914
<i>Spread it around.

910
01:04:29,960 --> 01:04:32,394
<i>You try to make your frosting</i>
<i>look rugged.

911
01:04:32,640 --> 01:04:34,153
Chocolate.

912
01:04:36,160 --> 01:04:38,720
Chocolate.

913
01:04:40,520 --> 01:04:43,353
Want a candy bar?
Look, I got a Baby Ruth.

914
01:04:43,600 --> 01:04:44,749
Sir?

915
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:51,671
Ruth, Ruth, Ruth, Baby Ruth.

916
01:04:51,920 --> 01:04:53,353
I'm gonna throw it to you.

917
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:06,158
I'm sorry, sir!
I tried to give it to you.

918
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:07,753
Oh, I'm sorry!

919
01:05:08,320 --> 01:05:11,676
I'm really sorry.
I'll get you a... I'll get you a...

920
01:05:31,920 --> 01:05:35,674
Jeez, mister, you're even hungrier
than I am.

921
01:05:38,880 --> 01:05:42,236
Booby traps. It's only booby traps.
Why you being such a sissy?

922
01:05:42,520 --> 01:05:43,748
Freaking kids.

923
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:53,917
- Kids must've cleaned him out.
- Right before they ate him.

924
01:05:54,160 --> 01:05:55,115
Stupid.

925
01:05:59,400 --> 01:06:01,038
Follow them size fives.

926
01:06:03,680 --> 01:06:04,829
Sloth.

927
01:06:06,520 --> 01:06:07,430
Chunk.

928
01:06:08,360 --> 01:06:09,793
Sloth.

929
01:06:11,280 --> 01:06:12,349
Chunk.

930
01:06:51,120 --> 01:06:54,749
Man, you smell like Phys. Ed.

931
01:06:56,240 --> 01:06:59,471
Mouth, hold this. Translate this.

932
01:07:00,720 --> 01:07:02,631
"Copper bones.

933
01:07:03,960 --> 01:07:05,791
Westward foams.

934
01:07:07,960 --> 01:07:09,075
Triple stones."

935
01:07:09,320 --> 01:07:11,072
This must be copper bones.

936
01:07:14,560 --> 01:07:15,788
Oh, sorry.

937
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,275
Wow. Look at that.

938
01:07:24,600 --> 01:07:26,272
Triple stones!

939
01:07:26,760 --> 01:07:29,991
We got you, One-Eyed Willy.
We're right behind you.

940
01:07:30,240 --> 01:07:32,674
Why couldn't I have had a sister?

941
01:07:32,920 --> 01:07:35,480
A little sister instead
of that?

942
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,309
No, that's too big.
Try the middle one.

943
01:07:41,560 --> 01:07:43,596
- You guys are crazy.
- No, the middle one!

944
01:07:44,200 --> 01:07:46,475
- It fits, Mikey! It fits!
- We got it!

945
01:07:46,720 --> 01:07:49,280
- We got you, One-Eyed Willy.
- Which way do we turn?

946
01:07:49,520 --> 01:07:50,953
West. Counterclockwise.

947
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:52,076
Counterclockwise.

948
01:07:52,320 --> 01:07:54,959
Try it, Mikey. Try it. Yeah, yeah!

949
01:08:00,320 --> 01:08:01,719
What the hell is that?

950
01:08:07,880 --> 01:08:09,518
It's gonna fall on us!

951
01:08:13,240 --> 01:08:15,470
It's one of Willy's tricks. Move!

952
01:08:33,920 --> 01:08:35,717
- He's gone.
- Oh, no.

953
01:08:35,960 --> 01:08:37,712
- Truly, truly gone.
- Don't be dead.

954
01:08:39,160 --> 01:08:43,119
Pinchers of Peril. You guys, I've
been saved by my Pinchers of Peril.

955
01:08:43,800 --> 01:08:46,598
He's alive! He's alive!

956
01:08:51,040 --> 01:08:54,350
You guys, I'm in another room!

957
01:08:54,800 --> 01:08:57,553
Hello, sheriff? I'm at
the Lighthouse Lounge...

958
01:08:57,800 --> 01:09:00,633
...and I want to report,
well, a murder.

959
01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:04,236
Wait a minute. Just hold on here.
Is that you again, Lawrence?

960
01:09:04,680 --> 01:09:08,036
Sheriff, look, this time I'm telling
you the truth.

961
01:09:08,280 --> 01:09:11,875
I'm locked inside the Fratellis'
basement with this guy.

962
01:09:12,880 --> 01:09:15,075
Rocky Road?

963
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:18,514
Like the time 50 Iranian terrorists...

964
01:09:18,760 --> 01:09:20,990
...took over the Sizzler
steak houses?

965
01:09:21,240 --> 01:09:24,550
Sloth, get back here. Hold on.
Sloth, what are you doing?

966
01:09:24,800 --> 01:09:29,191
Like the prank about creatures that
multiply when you throw water on them?

967
01:09:29,680 --> 01:09:34,151
Sloth! Sloth!
Sloth's going into the fireplace!

968
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:36,989
Lawrence?

969
01:09:37,760 --> 01:09:41,036
- No, Sloth, it's just your echo.
- Echo!

970
01:09:41,560 --> 01:09:43,790
No, I'll show you!
Don't go down there!

971
01:09:44,040 --> 01:09:46,508
It's all dark down there, Sloth.

972
01:09:47,320 --> 01:09:49,117
It's your echo, Sloth. Echo.

973
01:09:53,200 --> 01:09:54,838
I gotta go to the bathroom.

974
01:09:55,760 --> 01:09:57,716
Pee break. Who's got to go?

975
01:09:58,120 --> 01:09:59,030
- Me.
- Me.

976
01:09:59,280 --> 01:10:00,599
- Me.
- Me.

977
01:10:01,160 --> 01:10:02,070
Me.

978
01:10:02,600 --> 01:10:06,718
This is the little boys' room and
that tunnel's the little girls' room.

979
01:10:06,960 --> 01:10:08,075
Let's go.

980
01:10:10,120 --> 01:10:11,792
Brand, where you going?

981
01:10:12,040 --> 01:10:13,553
This is the men's room.

982
01:10:16,760 --> 01:10:18,910
- Where you going?
- The men's room, Mikey.

983
01:10:19,160 --> 01:10:21,230
Yeah, we're going to the men's room.

984
01:10:30,880 --> 01:10:34,509
Yeah, Mikey's been through here
all right.

985
01:10:46,960 --> 01:10:49,190
Andy, this is not the time
nor the place.

986
01:10:49,480 --> 01:10:52,153
Believe me, I know what I'm doing.

987
01:10:52,400 --> 01:10:54,277
Brand! Brand!

988
01:10:54,760 --> 01:10:56,876
Go see what she's ragging about,
will you?

989
01:11:10,080 --> 01:11:12,116
Brand? Hurry, I'm in here...

990
01:11:12,360 --> 01:11:14,794
...with my eyes closed.

991
01:11:37,880 --> 01:11:41,156
- Wrong way, lover-boy. It's this way.
- Thanks.

992
01:11:46,960 --> 01:11:49,030
Okay, you kissed, now tell.

993
01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:52,598
There's something weird.

994
01:11:52,920 --> 01:11:54,478
What? What is it?

995
01:11:55,240 --> 01:11:56,798
Does Brand wear braces?

996
01:11:59,360 --> 01:12:01,237
Why are you laughing?

997
01:12:01,520 --> 01:12:04,239
Stef, it was beautiful.

998
01:12:05,800 --> 01:12:07,677
Next time, kiss him
with your eyes open.

999
01:12:07,920 --> 01:12:10,832
It's a whole different experience.

1000
01:12:11,280 --> 01:12:13,111
Be careful. There's a hole, I think.

1001
01:12:13,360 --> 01:12:15,237
I think Brand was standing in it.

1002
01:12:15,680 --> 01:12:20,231
Ma, after we dump the kids, how do we
get out? I ain't left no trail.

1003
01:12:20,480 --> 01:12:23,472
They're right around here.
I can smell their bubble gum.

1004
01:12:23,720 --> 01:12:27,349
Ma, look. Give you three guesses
who left this rope.

1005
01:12:27,960 --> 01:12:29,029
You all right?

1006
01:12:45,760 --> 01:12:47,955
What, are you crazy? They're here!

1007
01:12:48,480 --> 01:12:50,789
They're here? They're here.
They're here!

1008
01:12:51,680 --> 01:12:54,319
Quiet. Right down there.

1009
01:12:54,600 --> 01:12:57,194
This way. This way! This way!

1010
01:12:57,480 --> 01:12:59,118
Come on, right through here!

1011
01:12:59,360 --> 01:13:03,797
Let's go, follow me. Data, come on,
don't fall behind. Let's go!

1012
01:13:09,480 --> 01:13:10,708
Come on!

1013
01:13:11,320 --> 01:13:13,675
- Watch your step, Ma.
- Watch your own.

1014
01:13:17,920 --> 01:13:18,875
Oh, God.

1015
01:13:24,520 --> 01:13:25,748
- What is this?
- Keep going.

1016
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,673
- Oh, great.
- It looks like a boat mast.

1017
01:13:32,200 --> 01:13:34,475
Jerk alert!

1018
01:13:49,320 --> 01:13:50,958
Somebody's coming.

1019
01:13:52,040 --> 01:13:52,995
You there, Ma?

1020
01:13:53,240 --> 01:13:54,309
Hurry up.

1021
01:13:55,920 --> 01:13:58,912
- Data, hurry up!
- Don't be a fool, Data, come on!

1022
01:13:59,160 --> 01:14:03,711
- I got a great idea. Slick shoes!
- Slick shoes? Are you crazy?

1023
01:14:09,920 --> 01:14:11,797
Data, come on!

1024
01:14:12,280 --> 01:14:14,589
Good enough. I can see
their flashlight!

1025
01:14:17,880 --> 01:14:20,110
Hi, fellas. Remember me?

1026
01:14:28,640 --> 01:14:30,596
Stop or I'm gonna shoot!

1027
01:14:36,600 --> 01:14:39,273
- You'll start a cave-in!
- What do you think that was?

1028
01:14:39,560 --> 01:14:42,199
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

1029
01:14:42,480 --> 01:14:45,074
Hurry up with that flare!
It's pitch-black!

1030
01:14:48,800 --> 01:14:50,791
- Do you have a match?
- No.

1031
01:14:51,040 --> 01:14:52,314
I'll light it on the lamp.

1032
01:14:52,600 --> 01:14:54,079
- Cross now!
- Wait a minute!

1033
01:14:54,320 --> 01:14:56,595
- Don't push, Jake!
- I'm not!

1034
01:15:02,080 --> 01:15:04,036
Sweetheart, are you okay?

1035
01:15:04,520 --> 01:15:06,192
No.

1036
01:15:06,640 --> 01:15:10,428
These are all solid. Look at this.
All solid.

1037
01:15:10,720 --> 01:15:12,233
What is that?

1038
01:15:15,200 --> 01:15:16,110
It's disgusting.

1039
01:15:21,680 --> 01:15:22,635
Wow.

1040
01:15:23,400 --> 01:15:24,753
Gnarly.

1041
01:15:25,040 --> 01:15:26,951
That's atrocious, you guys!

1042
01:15:27,200 --> 01:15:29,634
Help him! Help him! Hurry up!

1043
01:15:36,880 --> 01:15:37,790
What are you doing?

1044
01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:41,915
Stop playing around! They're getting
away! What's the matter with you?

1045
01:15:42,760 --> 01:15:46,309
"To move on, play the tune...

1046
01:15:46,680 --> 01:15:48,636
...as each note is said.

1047
01:15:49,240 --> 01:15:52,915
If you make too many mistakes...

1048
01:15:54,040 --> 01:15:57,635
...ye will surely be...

1049
01:15:57,880 --> 01:15:59,279
- Be what?
<i>...muerto.</i>"

1050
01:16:00,560 --> 01:16:01,959
- What is that? Come on.
- Dead.

1051
01:16:02,200 --> 01:16:04,031
Oh, God!

1052
01:16:06,600 --> 01:16:09,160
We gotta play the bones
to get out of here?

1053
01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:10,828
Exactly.

1054
01:16:11,520 --> 01:16:13,750
- They're on the bridge.
- Hurry up!

1055
01:16:14,200 --> 01:16:18,910
- Look! There are notes on this.
- Andy, you took piano lessons.

1056
01:16:19,160 --> 01:16:22,232
- I was 4 years old.
- You want to live to be 17?

1057
01:16:22,520 --> 01:16:23,748
- Hit it!
- What're you doing!

1058
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,833
Finding middle C. This isn't
like my mother's Steinway.

1059
01:16:27,080 --> 01:16:28,991
Do something, hurry!

1060
01:16:29,240 --> 01:16:32,710
This first chord, I think, is...

1061
01:16:33,600 --> 01:16:34,669
Go on, Andy!

1062
01:16:40,480 --> 01:16:42,471
My God, it's working!
You did it!

1063
01:16:43,880 --> 01:16:47,350
- Way to go, Andy! Way to go!
- It's all coming back to me. Okay.

1064
01:16:49,320 --> 01:16:50,309
A.

1065
01:16:51,520 --> 01:16:55,069
- C sharp, D.
- Remember the lessons, play it right!

1066
01:17:17,840 --> 01:17:22,038
They're coming, guys. They're
down there! They're coming out!

1067
01:17:22,320 --> 01:17:24,880
- What should I do?
- All right!

1068
01:17:29,400 --> 01:17:30,515
They're coming.

1069
01:17:33,640 --> 01:17:36,598
Guys, they look really pissed off!

1070
01:17:45,880 --> 01:17:48,030
- What were you thinking?
- I hit the wrong note.

1071
01:17:48,280 --> 01:17:51,716
- I'm not Liberace, you know.
- Listen, you're doing fine.

1072
01:17:51,960 --> 01:17:55,555
Andy, I believe in you.
Goonies always make mistakes.

1073
01:17:55,800 --> 01:17:57,472
Don't make any more.

1074
01:17:58,640 --> 01:18:00,870
Where was I?
A, A flat.

1075
01:18:11,240 --> 01:18:13,708
Hey, you guys, they're gone!
They're not here!

1076
01:18:36,240 --> 01:18:40,279
I can't tell if it's an A sharp
or a B flat.

1077
01:18:41,080 --> 01:18:43,833
If you hit the wrong note,
we'll all be flat.

1078
01:18:56,520 --> 01:18:57,555
Oh, my God!

1079
01:18:58,280 --> 01:18:59,349
Let's go, you guys!

1080
01:19:04,800 --> 01:19:06,233
Oh, my God!

1081
01:19:07,160 --> 01:19:09,196
Give me the gun. Give me the gun!

1082
01:19:10,040 --> 01:19:11,189
Let's go!

1083
01:19:12,280 --> 01:19:14,111
- Brand, wait!
- What?

1084
01:19:14,800 --> 01:19:16,233
- What are you doing?
- The map!

1085
01:19:16,520 --> 01:19:17,669
Let's get out of here!

1086
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:19,876
Damn it!

1087
01:20:05,880 --> 01:20:08,917
Oh, shit!

1088
01:20:10,360 --> 01:20:11,873
Geronimo!

1089
01:20:19,800 --> 01:20:22,678
- Are you okay, Mouth? Andy?
- Are you okay, Stef.

1090
01:20:22,960 --> 01:20:23,836
What?

1091
01:20:25,280 --> 01:20:29,592
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, wow!

1092
01:20:44,040 --> 01:20:45,234
Oh, my God!

1093
01:20:46,840 --> 01:20:47,795
Oh, God!

1094
01:20:48,120 --> 01:20:50,509
- Follow me.
- It's too...

1095
01:20:52,080 --> 01:20:53,195
I can't do it, Mama.

1096
01:20:58,360 --> 01:20:59,349
Idiot!

1097
01:21:04,240 --> 01:21:05,673
Hold on, you guys.

1098
01:21:07,520 --> 01:21:08,873
The water's really shallow.

1099
01:21:16,160 --> 01:21:17,434
You okay, Data?

1100
01:21:49,560 --> 01:21:51,596
You really think there's a treasure?

1101
01:21:51,840 --> 01:21:53,717
Andy, this whole ship's a treasure.

1102
01:21:55,720 --> 01:21:56,994
Mikey, look!

1103
01:21:59,960 --> 01:22:01,552
Don't worry. It's just a skeleton.

1104
01:22:08,240 --> 01:22:09,798
There's gotta be gold.

1105
01:22:12,120 --> 01:22:13,758
Data. Data's okay.

1106
01:22:20,640 --> 01:22:21,868
Data's okay.

1107
01:22:22,120 --> 01:22:26,511
Data's quite tired of falling!
And Data's tired of skeletons!

1108
01:22:26,840 --> 01:22:29,638
- Why didn't you use the stairs?
- Use the stairs!

1109
01:22:29,880 --> 01:22:30,835
Stairs!

1110
01:22:31,600 --> 01:22:35,070
The stupid guys tell me to use
the stairs when Data's falling.

1111
01:22:35,320 --> 01:22:38,710
- If Data's hurt, nobody cares anymore.
- Data's okay.

1112
01:22:40,400 --> 01:22:43,278
Then some guy tells me
I have stupid inventions.

1113
01:22:43,520 --> 01:22:45,988
I've been spending
months and months...

1114
01:22:46,240 --> 01:22:48,595
...studying on them
and inventing them. God!

1115
01:22:53,240 --> 01:22:55,674
- Don't touch that.
- Why not? He's dead.

1116
01:22:55,920 --> 01:22:58,388
- Have some respect.
- Put that down.

1117
01:22:58,640 --> 01:23:00,312
How many ships were there?

1118
01:23:00,560 --> 01:23:03,996
- Billions.
- Billions? Billions?!

1119
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:07,958
Watch where you step, all right?
Don't slip. Don't...

1120
01:23:15,320 --> 01:23:17,197
Mouth, translate.

1121
01:23:17,480 --> 01:23:21,314
Translate nothing. It's a sketch
of the cannonball chamber.

1122
01:23:21,600 --> 01:23:22,476
Where's the gold?!

1123
01:23:22,720 --> 01:23:25,996
Where's the gold, Mikey?!
I'm tired of these games!

1124
01:23:31,120 --> 01:23:32,553
I set off another trap.

1125
01:23:35,840 --> 01:23:39,469
Oh, God! I'm sorry. Are you okay?
Are you guys okay?

1126
01:23:40,200 --> 01:23:40,916
Oh, my God!

1127
01:23:41,320 --> 01:23:42,230
It's Willy.

1128
01:23:44,360 --> 01:23:45,554
Break through.

1129
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:05,560
- What's up there?
- It's all right, Brand.

1130
01:24:05,800 --> 01:24:07,756
- Just give me a second.
- Okay.

1131
01:24:40,640 --> 01:24:42,949
I know how these guys must've died.

1132
01:24:51,160 --> 01:24:54,118
It's Willy. One-Eyed Willy.

1133
01:25:03,680 --> 01:25:04,635
Hi, Willy.

1134
01:25:06,680 --> 01:25:10,514
I'm Mike Walsh.
You've been expecting me...

1135
01:25:11,320 --> 01:25:12,548
...haven't you?

1136
01:25:13,640 --> 01:25:15,198
I made it. I beat you.

1137
01:25:15,480 --> 01:25:18,756
I got here in one piece so far.

1138
01:25:29,560 --> 01:25:33,109
That's why they call you
One-Eyed Willy, One-Eyed Willy.

1139
01:25:36,040 --> 01:25:38,508
We have a lot in common, huh, Willy?

1140
01:25:41,080 --> 01:25:42,672
You know something, Willy?

1141
01:25:43,680 --> 01:25:45,193
You're the first Goonie.

1142
01:25:54,840 --> 01:25:55,795
Hi, guys.

1143
01:25:57,080 --> 01:26:00,072
How's it going? This is Willy.

1144
01:26:00,640 --> 01:26:01,993
One-Eyed Willy.

1145
01:26:02,760 --> 01:26:03,909
Say hi, Willy.

1146
01:26:05,600 --> 01:26:08,637
Those are my friends, the Goonies.

1147
01:26:10,800 --> 01:26:12,358
How long have you been there?

1148
01:26:13,080 --> 01:26:15,719
Long enough, Mikey. Long enough.

1149
01:26:37,480 --> 01:26:39,789
What are you staring at?
Let's go, load up!

1150
01:26:40,040 --> 01:26:41,951
Anything that fits in your pockets.

1151
01:26:42,200 --> 01:26:43,428
Except that.

1152
01:26:43,920 --> 01:26:46,514
- Why?
- That's Willy's.

1153
01:26:47,800 --> 01:26:49,836
Save that for Willy. Anything else.

1154
01:26:58,680 --> 01:27:00,352
Bye-bye, marbles.

1155
01:27:01,240 --> 01:27:03,435
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

1156
01:27:03,720 --> 01:27:05,950
Hurry up! Those creeps are
still after us.

1157
01:27:06,200 --> 01:27:09,909
- That's right! What will we do?
- I don't know. Who cares?

1158
01:27:11,080 --> 01:27:12,991
- I got an idea.
- What is it?

1159
01:27:13,240 --> 01:27:14,593
I saw it on <i>The Hardy Boys.

1160
01:27:15,240 --> 01:27:17,800
We leave a trail of jewels
into one cave...

1161
01:27:18,120 --> 01:27:19,473
...and we hide in another.

1162
01:27:20,040 --> 01:27:22,918
When the Fratellis go into that cave,
we make a run for it.

1163
01:27:23,160 --> 01:27:25,276
Now that sounds like a great idea!

1164
01:27:26,680 --> 01:27:29,638
- Outside!
- Okay, this is war!

1165
01:27:29,880 --> 01:27:31,757
- Data, don't do anything!
- No!

1166
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:33,149
I said, outside!

1167
01:27:33,400 --> 01:27:36,710
- We won't be taken alive, matey!
- What do you mean "we"?

1168
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:37,995
Get Data!

1169
01:27:38,240 --> 01:27:40,390
It's not funny! She's got a gun!

1170
01:27:40,640 --> 01:27:41,959
Come on, snap to.

1171
01:27:42,200 --> 01:27:44,589
- Oh, I love that.
- Come on!

1172
01:27:50,200 --> 01:27:51,918
Sneaking up on me, huh?

1173
01:27:53,640 --> 01:27:55,756
I know what I'm doing.

1174
01:28:06,160 --> 01:28:07,070
I'm all right.

1175
01:28:07,320 --> 01:28:09,231
Data's just unhappy.

1176
01:28:10,800 --> 01:28:12,028
Pinchers of Power.

1177
01:28:12,280 --> 01:28:15,590
- Get it off me!
- Let me help you, brother.

1178
01:28:20,960 --> 01:28:22,234
- My gun!
- That's it!

1179
01:28:22,520 --> 01:28:25,956
All right, no more Mr. Nice Guy.
Let's go!

1180
01:28:33,120 --> 01:28:34,394
Empty your pockets!

1181
01:28:34,640 --> 01:28:37,438
Hurry up, empty your jewels! Come on!

1182
01:28:43,320 --> 01:28:46,915
You're so quiet all of a sudden.
Aren't you called Mouth?

1183
01:28:53,840 --> 01:28:55,193
Oh, my God.

1184
01:28:57,600 --> 01:28:58,953
Is that all?

1185
01:29:01,720 --> 01:29:04,280
Oh, my God.

1186
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:08,149
You gross old witch.

1187
01:29:10,360 --> 01:29:14,512
You want to play pirate?
We'll play pirate. March!

1188
01:29:14,760 --> 01:29:17,911
- Keep going, smarty.
- I can't swim with my hands tied.

1189
01:29:18,160 --> 01:29:20,230
We'll play pirates. Walk the plank!

1190
01:29:20,480 --> 01:29:22,118
Get out on that plank.

1191
01:29:22,360 --> 01:29:25,750
- Say goodbye to your little friends.
- Brand!

1192
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:32,035
Get out of the way.

1193
01:29:35,720 --> 01:29:37,517
Two down. Who's next?

1194
01:29:43,520 --> 01:29:45,636
Ow, will you stop pushing me?!

1195
01:29:45,880 --> 01:29:49,429
- You're pulling my hair!
- You get that girl away from me.

1196
01:29:49,840 --> 01:29:51,717
Go join your friends, you weasels.

1197
01:29:51,960 --> 01:29:53,678
Hey, you guys!

1198
01:30:00,280 --> 01:30:02,316
Sloth! How'd he get out?

1199
01:30:02,560 --> 01:30:05,677
Sloth, save them!
Save them, it's Mouth and Stef!

1200
01:30:16,800 --> 01:30:20,315
- Chunk.
- No, it's Captain Chunk.

1201
01:30:20,800 --> 01:30:21,949
Give me the sword.

1202
01:30:23,160 --> 01:30:26,755
Captain Chunk says let's get the hell
out of here!

1203
01:30:46,280 --> 01:30:47,269
The rope.

1204
01:30:50,560 --> 01:30:51,709
Jump rope, Slothy.

1205
01:30:51,960 --> 01:30:55,111
- What do you mean, "jump rope"?
- You know, jump rope.

1206
01:31:17,400 --> 01:31:18,628
We're in deep shit now.

1207
01:31:18,880 --> 01:31:20,313
Oh, shit.

1208
01:31:22,600 --> 01:31:26,115
- Remember we went to the Bronx Zoo?
- Don't start that.

1209
01:31:26,360 --> 01:31:30,114
- They wanted to leave you. I said no.
- We never been to the Bronx Zoo!

1210
01:31:30,360 --> 01:31:35,229
Remember how they bought Francis a
toupee instead of fixing your teeth?

1211
01:31:35,520 --> 01:31:39,195
- I don't wear a hairpiece!
- You rotten bastard!

1212
01:31:50,560 --> 01:31:52,949
Here, grab on to the rock. Come on.

1213
01:32:10,200 --> 01:32:12,350
What happened to your braces?

1214
01:32:15,440 --> 01:32:17,396
Mikey, that little...

1215
01:32:18,800 --> 01:32:19,915
Heave-ho!

1216
01:32:23,720 --> 01:32:26,109
- I won't sing no more.
- Just put us down safely!

1217
01:32:26,360 --> 01:32:27,588
I won't sing anymore.

1218
01:32:28,080 --> 01:32:30,674
Hey, you guys!

1219
01:32:34,600 --> 01:32:36,113
Mama.

1220
01:32:36,920 --> 01:32:38,911
Come to Mama, baby. Come on.

1221
01:32:44,160 --> 01:32:45,149
Ma...

1222
01:32:45,400 --> 01:32:47,709
...you've been bad.

1223
01:32:49,600 --> 01:32:51,670
Slothy, I may have been bad.

1224
01:32:51,920 --> 01:32:56,072
I may have kept you chained in
that room. But it was for your good.

1225
01:33:00,720 --> 01:33:02,073
Remember? I sang to you.

1226
01:33:04,520 --> 01:33:06,078
When you were a little boy.

1227
01:33:18,040 --> 01:33:18,950
Fall!

1228
01:33:20,560 --> 01:33:21,629
Break!

1229
01:33:22,360 --> 01:33:23,270
Fall!

1230
01:33:23,880 --> 01:33:25,154
I only dropped you once.

1231
01:33:26,480 --> 01:33:27,913
Well, maybe twice.

1232
01:33:30,960 --> 01:33:32,188
Put me down.

1233
01:33:40,280 --> 01:33:42,111
- I don't mind dying.
- Calm down.

1234
01:33:42,360 --> 01:33:43,554
- We'll be okay.
- Sure.

1235
01:33:50,200 --> 01:33:53,875
I gotta rot with you through eternity?
I don't want to rot with you!

1236
01:33:59,520 --> 01:34:03,274
Sloth, this is the guys.
Guys, this is Sloth.

1237
01:34:04,800 --> 01:34:09,157
Brand, we can't go. We can't leave
all that gold. That's our future.

1238
01:34:09,400 --> 01:34:13,154
If we stay here, we got no future.
We'll come back for it later.

1239
01:34:13,400 --> 01:34:15,436
- All that rich stuff.
- Come on!

1240
01:34:16,800 --> 01:34:18,279
Mama, just let us down easy.

1241
01:34:20,360 --> 01:34:22,590
Not the sword!
Don't do that, we're gonna...

1242
01:34:27,840 --> 01:34:29,034
- You all right?
- Yeah. You?

1243
01:34:29,280 --> 01:34:30,269
Yeah.

1244
01:34:31,960 --> 01:34:33,518
Will you get up?!

1245
01:34:35,120 --> 01:34:36,792
Let's go find the gold.

1246
01:34:37,160 --> 01:34:38,639
Head for the light.

1247
01:34:46,080 --> 01:34:48,071
Thank you, Mr. Willy.

1248
01:34:48,480 --> 01:34:49,833
Thank you.

1249
01:34:50,280 --> 01:34:51,838
You've made my day.

1250
01:34:52,800 --> 01:34:55,189
This is a real treat.

1251
01:35:00,120 --> 01:35:01,189
What the hell is this?

1252
01:35:01,760 --> 01:35:04,228
- Another one of those booby traps!
- Booby trap!

1253
01:35:05,240 --> 01:35:06,116
Get out of here!

1254
01:35:06,360 --> 01:35:07,918
What booby traps?

1255
01:35:08,200 --> 01:35:10,475
Booby traps!
Didn't you see the movie?

1256
01:35:10,720 --> 01:35:12,438
Leave it. Let's get out.

1257
01:35:12,680 --> 01:35:14,193
Look, you guys, daylight.

1258
01:35:14,480 --> 01:35:17,358
There's been a cave-in before.
Maybe we can get through.

1259
01:35:17,640 --> 01:35:18,993
I can't see. Got a light?

1260
01:35:19,240 --> 01:35:21,549
I got the last candle. Mikey, get it.

1261
01:35:22,720 --> 01:35:24,438
Is there a way out or what?

1262
01:35:24,840 --> 01:35:26,910
This is a funny candle. It sparkles.

1263
01:35:27,160 --> 01:35:29,355
- It's not a candle, it's dynamite!
- Dynamite!

1264
01:35:54,120 --> 01:35:56,190
Women and children first!

1265
01:35:56,800 --> 01:35:59,109
- You guys, push.
- Push.

1266
01:35:59,360 --> 01:36:00,793
What about the loot?

1267
01:36:01,040 --> 01:36:02,632
What about our lives?

1268
01:36:13,360 --> 01:36:15,157
Can you do it? Come on, hurry.

1269
01:36:16,480 --> 01:36:17,708
Go!

1270
01:36:20,520 --> 01:36:21,589
Hurry up.

1271
01:36:24,520 --> 01:36:26,590
Sloth! Help us!

1272
01:36:35,840 --> 01:36:37,751
Sloth love Chunk!

1273
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:40,434
I love you too. You'll get crushed.

1274
01:36:42,400 --> 01:36:43,913
Sloth, help!

1275
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:49,831
Come on, Sloth!

1276
01:37:26,200 --> 01:37:28,873
Well, I'll be damned.
It's them goobers.

1277
01:37:29,400 --> 01:37:30,992
They weren't here a minute ago.

1278
01:37:31,240 --> 01:37:34,152
- But they're here now. Call Harvey.
- Yes, sir.

1279
01:37:34,400 --> 01:37:36,470
- Here!
- Over here!

1280
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:46,194
Get the camera.

1281
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:53,194
Hi, Mom. Hi, Dad.

1282
01:37:53,760 --> 01:37:55,637
I guess we're kind of in deep sh...

1283
01:37:59,800 --> 01:38:01,597
Look, you're a mess.

1284
01:38:11,320 --> 01:38:14,198
- Look what we brought you.
- Oh, pizza!

1285
01:38:14,480 --> 01:38:17,358
- Your favorite.
- Everything's on it.

1286
01:38:17,600 --> 01:38:20,831
- We were in the tunnels.
- It's good to hear your voice.

1287
01:38:21,080 --> 01:38:22,672
- I lost my glasses.
- It's okay.

1288
01:38:22,920 --> 01:38:24,148
Can I take piano lessons?

1289
01:38:24,400 --> 01:38:26,516
- You'll get ammonia.
- It's pneumonia, Ma.

1290
01:38:26,760 --> 01:38:28,557
Get these pants off.

1291
01:38:30,080 --> 01:38:31,559
Hold it right there.

1292
01:38:34,680 --> 01:38:35,669
That's great, Dad.

1293
01:38:35,920 --> 01:38:37,512
Just watch this.

1294
01:38:55,640 --> 01:38:58,393
I just wanted to say thank you...

1295
01:38:58,640 --> 01:39:00,870
...for offering to save
my life and everything.

1296
01:39:01,120 --> 01:39:04,157
- What, what, what?
- I wanted to say thank you.

1297
01:39:04,400 --> 01:39:07,073
Wow. "Thank you." A real moment.

1298
01:39:07,320 --> 01:39:10,756
Your voice is kind of nice when
your mouth isn't screwing it up.

1299
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:12,274
Yeah, well, thanks.

1300
01:39:12,560 --> 01:39:15,677
And you know, your looks
are kind of pretty...

1301
01:39:16,600 --> 01:39:18,750
...when your face doesn't screw it up.

1302
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:19,910
I'm just kidding.

1303
01:39:21,960 --> 01:39:23,234
Hey, Mikey.

1304
01:39:25,360 --> 01:39:28,477
You know, you're a great
little kid... Person.

1305
01:39:29,080 --> 01:39:31,469
You keep kissing girls
the way you do...

1306
01:39:31,720 --> 01:39:33,676
...the parts of you
that don't work so good...

1307
01:39:33,920 --> 01:39:36,195
...they'll catch up
to the ones that do.

1308
01:39:48,480 --> 01:39:50,198
- What?
- Let her mother worry.

1309
01:39:55,160 --> 01:39:56,593
Oh, who needs it?

1310
01:39:58,000 --> 01:39:58,989
It's the Fratellis!

1311
01:40:00,400 --> 01:40:02,550
- Thank God you're here.
- We need your help.

1312
01:40:06,080 --> 01:40:08,071
You're all under arrest. Let's go.

1313
01:40:10,560 --> 01:40:11,470
Don't shoot him!

1314
01:40:12,800 --> 01:40:16,315
- Look out, kid.
- No! Don't shoot him!

1315
01:40:16,600 --> 01:40:20,036
Get them out of here.
You don't know what you're doing.

1316
01:40:20,600 --> 01:40:21,999
These are the bad guys!

1317
01:40:22,240 --> 01:40:23,832
Those are the bad guys!

1318
01:40:25,080 --> 01:40:27,992
Put him down, Sloth.
Put him down. It'll be all right.

1319
01:40:32,040 --> 01:40:32,995
Come on, Mama.

1320
01:40:33,240 --> 01:40:36,437
You have no idea who I am.
You want to lose your job?

1321
01:40:42,680 --> 01:40:44,716
You're gonna live with me now.

1322
01:40:46,480 --> 01:40:48,436
I'm gonna take care of you.

1323
01:40:50,320 --> 01:40:51,878
Because I love you.

1324
01:40:52,720 --> 01:40:56,110
- I love you, Chunk.
- Oh, I love you, Sloth.

1325
01:40:57,120 --> 01:41:00,556
Walsh, today's the day,
so let's get this over with.

1326
01:41:01,480 --> 01:41:02,595
Irving?

1327
01:41:03,120 --> 01:41:05,998
- I'm sorry, Irene.
- Come on, we don't have all day.

1328
01:41:06,600 --> 01:41:08,875
There's 50 houses
to tear down after yours!

1329
01:41:09,520 --> 01:41:11,158
- Ease off, Brand.
- Punk!

1330
01:41:12,800 --> 01:41:14,677
Sheriff, I want you to witness this.

1331
01:41:15,920 --> 01:41:17,035
Sorry, Dad.

1332
01:41:17,480 --> 01:41:19,596
We had our hands on the future.

1333
01:41:19,840 --> 01:41:22,400
But we blew it to save our own lives.

1334
01:41:22,600 --> 01:41:23,794
Sorry.

1335
01:41:24,640 --> 01:41:28,030
That's all right. You and Brand
are safe with your mom and me.

1336
01:41:28,880 --> 01:41:31,678
That makes us
the richest people in Astoria.

1337
01:41:35,520 --> 01:41:39,069
You're looking at the richest people
in Astoria. Now sign it.

1338
01:41:48,720 --> 01:41:50,836
I'm sure gonna miss being a Goonie.

1339
01:42:01,880 --> 01:42:03,472
What's she saying, Mouth?

1340
01:42:07,320 --> 01:42:08,992
- No pen.
- No pen?

1341
01:42:09,240 --> 01:42:10,559
No write.

1342
01:42:12,280 --> 01:42:13,633
No sign!

1343
01:42:14,520 --> 01:42:15,919
Don't sign!

1344
01:42:21,720 --> 01:42:23,950
- What's in the bag?
- What is it?

1345
01:42:34,120 --> 01:42:37,715
Dad! It's my marble bag!
The Fratellis forgot to check it.

1346
01:42:37,960 --> 01:42:42,351
I put the jewels in it.
We don't have to leave the Goon Docks!

1347
01:42:42,600 --> 01:42:47,355
There'll be no more signing today
or ever again!

1348
01:42:50,200 --> 01:42:52,350
Are those jewels real?
How'd you find them?

1349
01:42:52,640 --> 01:42:53,993
Were your lives in danger?

1350
01:42:54,240 --> 01:42:56,800
- The octopus was scary.
- Octopus?

1351
01:42:57,000 --> 01:42:59,639
- It was dangerous.
- Walking the plank was scariest.

1352
01:42:59,880 --> 01:43:00,915
Walking the plank?

1353
01:43:01,160 --> 01:43:04,550
- Then we found the pirate ship.
- That and the pirate's treasure.

1354
01:43:04,800 --> 01:43:07,439
- We were chased by the Fratellis.
- That's enough.

1355
01:43:07,680 --> 01:43:10,831
- Telling more stories, Lawrence?
- No, this time it's for real.

1356
01:43:11,080 --> 01:43:12,877
How do you think we got the gold?

1357
01:43:14,040 --> 01:43:16,474

1
00:01:26,837 --> 00:01:29,837
You may now kiss the bride.

2
00:01:30,962 --> 00:01:33,630
From now on,
he'll take care of you...

3
00:01:33,713 --> 00:01:35,672
and you'll take care of him.

4
00:01:35,713 --> 00:01:38,089
He'll make you
big baloney sandwiches...

5
00:01:38,172 --> 00:01:41,005
and you'll buy him new socks
and a white briefcase.

6
00:01:41,047 --> 00:01:44,547
And you'll live happily ever after.

7
00:01:44,631 --> 00:01:47,172
You're the luckiest girl
in the world, Barbie.

8
00:01:47,255 --> 00:01:49,673
The luckiest girl in the world.

9
00:01:50,756 --> 00:01:53,006
You are the luckiest girl
in the world.

10
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:56,757
When I did Whitney Houston's wedding,
she was even more nervous than you.

11
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:59,215
And you look ten times better
than she did.

12
00:01:59,298 --> 00:02:01,674
No, I don't.

13
00:02:01,757 --> 00:02:04,340
This isn't gonna work.

14
00:02:04,423 --> 00:02:05,966
I'm fat!

15
00:02:06,048 --> 00:02:07,633
And I'm gonna marry
the wrong guy.

16
00:02:07,716 --> 00:02:09,174
Look at me.

17
00:02:09,216 --> 00:02:11,967
You are exquisite.

18
00:02:12,049 --> 00:02:14,383
You're timeless.

19
00:02:14,424 --> 00:02:17,675
You're the envy of your
future sister-in-law Janice...

20
00:02:17,758 --> 00:02:21,175
whom I over heard say at the last
gown fitting, "Look at those thighs.

21
00:02:21,258 --> 00:02:23,968
I'd kill for Tracy's thighs."

22
00:02:26,592 --> 00:02:28,759
But you have more
than great thighs.

23
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:33,384
You have the love
of a man named Tom.

24
00:02:33,467 --> 00:02:36,553
A man who, when he walked into
rehearsal dinner the other day...

25
00:02:36,637 --> 00:02:40,804
said, "I can't believe
she picked me.

26
00:02:40,845 --> 00:02:44,887
I can't believe I'm marrying the
most beautiful woman I've ever seen."

27
00:02:49,221 --> 00:02:52,638
That tells me that this marriage
of yours is not only gonna work...

28
00:02:54,097 --> 00:02:56,222
it's gonna last forever.

29
00:02:58,554 --> 00:02:59,972
Thank you.

30
00:03:03,972 --> 00:03:05,931
Oh, Mom, come here.

31
00:03:08,681 --> 00:03:10,223
Excuse me.

32
00:03:10,306 --> 00:03:12,931
Hey, what are you doing?

33
00:03:14,306 --> 00:03:15,722
Thank you!

34
00:03:16,889 --> 00:03:20,765
Keep to areas A, B and E. I don't want
any interference with the video team.

35
00:03:27,015 --> 00:03:30,598
I know who you're looking for.
They're right downstairs.

36
00:03:37,433 --> 00:03:39,433
- Father, where are you going?
- Nature calls.

37
00:03:39,517 --> 00:03:41,808
You must call back later.
We're about to start.

38
00:03:41,849 --> 00:03:43,808
Let's go. Inside.

39
00:03:47,016 --> 00:03:48,433
Good morning.

40
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,644
Penny, stop firting.
We're going in one.

41
00:04:10,477 --> 00:04:14,227
Penny, go to M-1 2.
We have a darkTower choking the AV.

42
00:04:17,227 --> 00:04:19,811
Hi, ma'am. You're in
the preferred seating list.

43
00:04:19,894 --> 00:04:22,436
- If you'll just follow me.
- Bye.

44
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,478
There we go.

45
00:04:24,562 --> 00:04:27,395
Enjoy the wedding
from way back here.

46
00:04:27,478 --> 00:04:29,144
darkTower demolished.

47
00:04:29,228 --> 00:04:32,228
All right.
Places, everyone.

48
00:04:32,311 --> 00:04:35,104
Todd, cut the fill lights.

49
00:04:35,187 --> 00:04:37,312
Maestro, on three.

50
00:04:37,396 --> 00:04:39,855
Excuse me, Mary. We can't find
the father of the bride.

51
00:04:39,938 --> 00:04:42,980
That's okay. I got it.
Penny, send over the FOB.

52
00:04:43,063 --> 00:04:45,771
I did, 15 minutes ago.

53
00:04:47,604 --> 00:04:50,355
Cover me up north.
The FOB is MIA.

54
00:04:52,772 --> 00:04:55,689
Oh, no, no, no.
Count to 1 00 and start again, okay?

55
00:05:14,232 --> 00:05:17,398
Father, you're gonna
have to hold it.

56
00:05:17,481 --> 00:05:18,898
Good.

57
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:31,400
Hey, guys, we're on.
Come on, put your jackets on.

58
00:05:33,066 --> 00:05:36,151
Hickory, dickory, dock.
The mouse ran up the clock.

59
00:05:36,234 --> 00:05:38,692
I have a 20 on the FOB.

60
00:05:42,151 --> 00:05:45,151
My little girl's
getting married today.

61
00:05:45,234 --> 00:05:48,984
I remember her graduation
from nursery school...

62
00:05:49,067 --> 00:05:52,527
when she was a little girl.

63
00:05:52,609 --> 00:05:54,527
I remember...

64
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:57,402
like it was yesterday.

65
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:01,152
- Who are you?
- I'm the wedding planner.

66
00:06:20,696 --> 00:06:22,654
Look, there's the wedding planner.

67
00:06:40,572 --> 00:06:43,029
She must lead
such a romantic life.

68
00:08:12,705 --> 00:08:15,039
"Earwax."

69
00:08:15,122 --> 00:08:18,373
"X" on a double letter.
"A" on a triple word.

70
00:08:18,457 --> 00:08:20,290
Seventy-two points.

71
00:08:20,373 --> 00:08:22,956
No, I challenge you.
"Earwax" is two words.

72
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,415
- It's one.
- You're bluffing.

73
00:08:24,498 --> 00:08:27,040
"Munch." Sixteen points.

74
00:08:27,123 --> 00:08:28,415
Sixteen.

75
00:08:28,498 --> 00:08:32,290
Maria, I know I'm a pain in the neck.
I just want you to be happy.

76
00:08:32,373 --> 00:08:36,499
I'm gonna say something that you
may be a little resistant to...

77
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:39,207
but sometimes a father
has to take action.

78
00:08:39,291 --> 00:08:41,166
What are you talking about?

79
00:08:41,207 --> 00:08:44,999
I found you a man
who has agreed to marry you.

80
00:08:45,041 --> 00:08:47,166
Oh, my God!

81
00:08:47,207 --> 00:08:49,208
If her mother was alive...

82
00:08:49,292 --> 00:08:51,667
and she heard that,
she'd wish she was dead.

83
00:08:51,751 --> 00:08:54,500
"Shaft." Twenty-two points.

84
00:08:54,584 --> 00:08:57,834
Anyway, you know him.
Remember Massimo?

85
00:08:57,917 --> 00:08:59,292
No. Who?

86
00:08:59,375 --> 00:09:03,585
Massimo Lenzetta, the little boy you
played with the summer we were in Italy?

87
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:06,752
- The kid who ate mud?
- That's the one!

88
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:11,960
I bumped into him on New Arrivals Night
at the Sicilian Association.

89
00:09:13,002 --> 00:09:15,793
Why, this is the most
wonderful day of my life!

90
00:09:15,877 --> 00:09:18,878
A man of my very own!

91
00:09:18,961 --> 00:09:22,003
- You must bring me to him at once.
- No need.

92
00:09:23,127 --> 00:09:24,669
- He's here?
- Yeah.

93
00:09:24,753 --> 00:09:27,502
- He's here? He's here?
- Massimo.

94
00:09:30,544 --> 00:09:33,004
- No, he didn't.
- Oh, my God.

95
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:38,337
Oh, my God.

96
00:09:42,337 --> 00:09:44,670
You remember Massimo?

97
00:09:45,712 --> 00:09:48,796
That mud did him good.

98
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:52,255
The last time I see you,
you were scrawny and ugly...

99
00:09:52,338 --> 00:09:54,504
and your head was too big
for your body.

100
00:09:55,588 --> 00:09:57,172
How nice. Thank you.

101
00:09:57,255 --> 00:09:58,546
You're welcome.

102
00:10:00,339 --> 00:10:02,589
I look forward
to our life together.

103
00:10:02,672 --> 00:10:06,131
I want three sons
and a garden of tomatoes.

104
00:10:06,215 --> 00:10:07,381
Okay then.

105
00:10:07,464 --> 00:10:09,256
Tomatoes? Tomatoes?

106
00:10:10,672 --> 00:10:12,089
Maria, wait.

107
00:10:28,466 --> 00:10:30,049
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

108
00:10:30,132 --> 00:10:32,966
The paper, and I'm gonna take
that Yahoo too.

109
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:35,217
4.50.

110
00:10:35,258 --> 00:10:36,592
- Keep it.
- Thanks.

111
00:10:36,633 --> 00:10:38,592
- See ya.
- Bye.

112
00:10:47,717 --> 00:10:50,259
- You look all excited.
- I am.

113
00:10:53,009 --> 00:10:55,676
- Mary, I need...
- Can you take it, please?

114
00:11:01,219 --> 00:11:02,677
Francine donolly.

115
00:11:02,719 --> 00:11:06,385
Her family sold gourmet sausages
out of the working-class kitchen.

116
00:11:06,469 --> 00:11:08,927
- Yeah?
- Now today, five years later...

117
00:11:09,010 --> 00:11:12,844
they're one of the biggest Internet
food specialty companies in America.

118
00:11:12,927 --> 00:11:16,553
Pierre, I love you, but if you use
another carnation in my bouquet...

119
00:11:16,637 --> 00:11:18,303
I will deport you.

120
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:20,136
- Thank you so much.
- Geri.

121
00:11:21,345 --> 00:11:23,969
They put her wedding announcement
in the society pages. Why?

122
00:11:24,011 --> 00:11:26,970
Because they want their new money
to be taken very seriously.

123
00:11:27,011 --> 00:11:30,345
Sheila! Book the Gazebo Package
for the Belettis, okay?

124
00:11:30,386 --> 00:11:31,971
Take this ugly fower.

125
00:11:32,054 --> 00:11:34,763
Call davis and tell him we need
a rush order on the chuppa rental.

126
00:11:34,846 --> 00:11:36,262
Thank you.

127
00:11:37,429 --> 00:11:39,805
- What the hell is this?
- Sunless tanning cream.

128
00:11:39,888 --> 00:11:42,262
Wedding's tomorrow.
You do the math.

129
00:11:42,304 --> 00:11:46,597
Stop crying. Quarter cup oflemonjuice,
half a cup of salt and a loofah sponge.

130
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:49,098
- Really?
- Scrub, scrub, scrub. Okay?

131
00:11:49,139 --> 00:11:52,098
Look, they see this
as their ticket into the club.

132
00:11:52,139 --> 00:11:55,139
They wanna make it a social event,
the party everybody talks about.

133
00:11:56,806 --> 00:11:58,806
Oh, thank you, Sheila.

134
00:11:58,889 --> 00:12:02,681
I already made contact. They're coming
to the Copeland wedding to see my work.

135
00:12:04,598 --> 00:12:06,556
I'm gonna nail this account.

136
00:12:06,598 --> 00:12:09,389
We'll be in every major
bridal magazine in the country.

137
00:12:09,473 --> 00:12:12,057
- It'll be our biggest event ever.
- Good.

138
00:12:12,890 --> 00:12:15,140
When I pull it off,
you're gonna make me a partner.

139
00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:18,308
- A partner?
- Yes.

140
00:12:19,557 --> 00:12:20,849
A partner.

141
00:12:20,933 --> 00:12:24,808
Okay, you are fantastic.

142
00:12:24,849 --> 00:12:26,849
Really, you're incredible.

143
00:12:26,933 --> 00:12:29,641
Very good work,
but let me tell you something.

144
00:12:29,682 --> 00:12:31,850
I built this business
on my back.

145
00:12:31,934 --> 00:12:34,017
I sweat, I toiled.

146
00:12:34,101 --> 00:12:38,059
I did things a little, innocent wedding
planner shouldn't even hear about.

147
00:12:38,101 --> 00:12:39,683
I won't even say it.

148
00:12:39,725 --> 00:12:43,767
I made the big plans, okay?
I made the sacrifices.

149
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:46,352
You also never made any money.

150
00:12:46,435 --> 00:12:47,560
Wow!

151
00:12:47,643 --> 00:12:50,227
Until I came along.

152
00:12:50,268 --> 00:12:52,768
Look, I've been here
for five years, Geri.

153
00:12:52,851 --> 00:12:55,726
I bring in more revenue than all of
your other wedding planners combined.

154
00:12:55,810 --> 00:12:57,560
- That's great.
- Times five!

155
00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:01,896
You need me.

156
00:13:01,979 --> 00:13:04,438
You know you need me.

157
00:13:04,522 --> 00:13:07,271
- I know you know that you need me.
- I don't know that.

158
00:13:07,355 --> 00:13:09,896
You know, maybe I should
just start my own company.

159
00:13:10,729 --> 00:13:11,854
You wouldn't dare.

160
00:13:11,938 --> 00:13:14,814
If I nailed the donolly account
and you made me a partner...

161
00:13:14,897 --> 00:13:18,106
you'd save me the trouble
ofdesigning my own letterhead.

162
00:13:18,189 --> 00:13:21,690
Let me see.
What font would I use?

163
00:13:21,773 --> 00:13:24,147
- You'regonnabeapartner!
- I gotta get the account first.

164
00:13:24,231 --> 00:13:26,231
Please, Mary, you're totally
gonna get the account.

165
00:13:26,314 --> 00:13:29,774
The Greenburg marriage lasted one year,
two months. You win the pot again.

166
00:13:29,816 --> 00:13:31,898
How do you do it?
I was more than four years off.

167
00:13:31,981 --> 00:13:34,440
"I Honestly Love You" by Olivia
Newton-John was their wedding song.

168
00:13:34,524 --> 00:13:36,440
Puts them in
the 1 4-month divorce range.

169
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:38,940
Speaking of honest love,
Jed was asking about you again.

170
00:13:39,023 --> 00:13:41,107
I don't trust a man
who gets regular pedicures.

171
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:43,440
- You haven't had a date in two years.
- Your point?

172
00:13:43,524 --> 00:13:45,483
If you're not interested inJed...

173
00:13:45,566 --> 00:13:48,483
there is a handsome Italian man
waiting to marry you in the lobby.

174
00:13:48,566 --> 00:13:50,483
Hide me.
did you talk to him?

175
00:13:50,566 --> 00:13:52,525
Just for a few minutes.
He is so adorable.

176
00:13:52,608 --> 00:13:54,858
- He's not adorable.
- How can you say that?

177
00:13:54,942 --> 00:13:59,025
When we were kids, he followed me for
a summer asking me if I had a vagina.

178
00:13:59,108 --> 00:14:01,192
I think that's adorable.

179
00:14:01,275 --> 00:14:03,275
I gotta get out of here.

180
00:14:04,401 --> 00:14:07,484
- Grab that side.
- You shouldn't hold that against him.

181
00:14:07,567 --> 00:14:10,651
You should give him a chance.
He was a little boy.

182
00:14:10,693 --> 00:14:13,943
Maybe he wanted to be a doctor.
Besides, you do have a vagina.

183
00:14:15,568 --> 00:14:17,860
My, this is hard to push
all by myself.

184
00:14:18,944 --> 00:14:22,735
May you have enough happiness
to keep you sweet...

185
00:14:22,819 --> 00:14:25,443
enough trials to keep you strong...

186
00:14:26,568 --> 00:14:28,944
enough hope to keep you happy...

187
00:14:29,028 --> 00:14:31,319
Enough friends to give you comfort.

188
00:14:31,403 --> 00:14:33,319
enough friends to give you comfort...

189
00:14:33,403 --> 00:14:35,569
- Enough determination...
- And enough determination...

190
00:14:35,653 --> 00:14:38,611
- To make each day a better day...
- To make each day...

191
00:14:38,653 --> 00:14:40,486
- A better day...
- Thanyesterday.

192
00:14:40,569 --> 00:14:42,153
- Than yesterday.
- Raise yourglass.

193
00:14:42,237 --> 00:14:45,779
Congratulations, you guys.
I love you both.

194
00:14:48,445 --> 00:14:51,779
What? You think Kissinger
came up with his own stuff?

195
00:14:51,862 --> 00:14:55,363
Youjust fed the best man
his speech.

196
00:14:55,405 --> 00:14:57,696
Smooth. Real smooth.

197
00:14:57,779 --> 00:15:00,697
You must be Francine.
I saw your article in Yahoo.

198
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:03,655
- Very impressive.
- God, I hate that picture.

199
00:15:03,738 --> 00:15:05,947
It made me look
like a psychotic poodle.

200
00:15:10,613 --> 00:15:13,447
My fiance has got to see this.

201
00:15:13,489 --> 00:15:15,990
He will just die.

202
00:15:16,073 --> 00:15:19,574
- He should be here by now.
- Most grooms are NI ds.

203
00:15:19,656 --> 00:15:22,198
"Not Into details."

204
00:15:22,282 --> 00:15:24,365
That's Eddie, all right.

205
00:15:24,448 --> 00:15:26,698
- I want you to meet my parents.
- Okay.

206
00:15:28,031 --> 00:15:30,032
Thanks, doll. That rocked.

207
00:15:32,449 --> 00:15:35,157
Mary, meet my parents,
Kitty andJack.

208
00:15:35,241 --> 00:15:37,283
- How do you do?
- So nice to meet you.

209
00:15:37,366 --> 00:15:39,575
- Dad, are you eating the food?
- Mm-hmm.

210
00:15:39,658 --> 00:15:42,533
Champagne is delightful.
Cristal? D.P.?

211
00:15:42,616 --> 00:15:45,576
- Actually, it's Taittinger.
- Exquisite.

212
00:15:45,659 --> 00:15:48,617
Mother, we're not guests. You're not
supposed to be drinking the champagne.

213
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:54,908
You give my little girl whatever
she wants, no expense spared.

214
00:15:54,992 --> 00:15:58,243
I'll be faxing you a list of the songs
I'll be performing at the reception.

215
00:15:58,326 --> 00:16:01,910
And none of those mini egg rolls.
A lot of important people are coming.

216
00:16:01,993 --> 00:16:05,076
- We've got an impression to make.
- We haven't hired her yet.

217
00:16:05,118 --> 00:16:09,243
And as previously discussed in detail,
you won't be singing at the wedding.

218
00:16:11,326 --> 00:16:13,452
I'm sorry, Mary. Hi.

219
00:16:13,494 --> 00:16:16,160
The belly dancer's here,
and she has a tattoo of an...

220
00:16:16,244 --> 00:16:19,119
It's okay. Penny,
I want you to meet the donollys.

221
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:21,661
- This is one of my associates, Penny.
- Pleasure.

222
00:16:22,744 --> 00:16:26,995
What I need you to do is go to the
office and prepare the Murdoch file.

223
00:16:27,036 --> 00:16:28,245
Ooh, Murdoch.

224
00:16:28,328 --> 00:16:29,745
As in...

225
00:16:29,829 --> 00:16:30,996
discretion.

226
00:16:31,079 --> 00:16:32,203
Oops.

227
00:16:32,287 --> 00:16:35,954
The Murdoch files. Right.

228
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:39,537
All right now, wedding woman.

229
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:41,579
Let's get down to brass tacks.

230
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:43,580
What do you see for our wedding?

231
00:16:44,621 --> 00:16:48,080
Well, now, having met you...

232
00:16:49,872 --> 00:16:52,705
off the top of my head...

233
00:16:52,788 --> 00:16:54,205
let's see.

234
00:16:55,872 --> 00:16:57,330
Night.

235
00:16:58,372 --> 00:16:59,998
dubounce Botanical Gardens.

236
00:17:00,956 --> 00:17:05,455
White, silk tents
thin enough to see the stars.

237
00:17:06,248 --> 00:17:08,081
Candlelight.

238
00:17:08,123 --> 00:17:10,455
Wedgewood.

239
00:17:10,539 --> 00:17:13,790
Exotic waringin trees
imported from Bali.

240
00:17:14,748 --> 00:17:17,748
I'm thinking Gatsby.

241
00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:19,999
Not a period wedding...

242
00:17:20,082 --> 00:17:22,999
but the spirit of it,
the time.

243
00:17:26,374 --> 00:17:29,417
I nailed it, Geri.
Yeah, but they want it in three months.

244
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:31,916
They're going forJune.
I know.

245
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,624
The clock is ticking.
Put Penny on.

246
00:17:38,916 --> 00:17:40,875
Guess what, Miss Moneypenny?

247
00:17:44,668 --> 00:17:46,001
Hold on, Penny.

248
00:17:48,418 --> 00:17:50,084
This shoe is stuck.

249
00:17:59,252 --> 00:18:01,461
Not my good shoes.

250
00:18:01,544 --> 00:18:03,085
Oh, my goodness.

251
00:18:08,918 --> 00:18:11,127
My new Gucci shoe.

252
00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:13,378
Come on!

253
00:18:21,297 --> 00:18:24,088
Oh, are you okay?
Are you okay?

254
00:18:26,672 --> 00:18:28,298
I'm great.

255
00:18:28,381 --> 00:18:30,673
- Okay.
- Where's my shoe?

256
00:18:30,757 --> 00:18:33,757
Your shoe?
You got it right here.

257
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:36,423
Now talk to me.
How are you feeling?

258
00:18:36,506 --> 00:18:40,840
Are you experiencing any dizziness,
nausea, difficulty breathing?

259
00:18:42,632 --> 00:18:44,215
The breathing thing rings a bell.

260
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:50,091
Then again, you are on top of me,
cutting off my air supply.

261
00:18:51,507 --> 00:18:54,758
Your mental clarity's excellent.
That's good. That's good.

262
00:18:55,841 --> 00:18:58,300
don't appear to have a concussion.

263
00:18:58,341 --> 00:19:00,300
You took quite a fall.

264
00:19:00,341 --> 00:19:02,300
Why are you still on top of me?

265
00:19:07,009 --> 00:19:09,134
That's a good question.

266
00:19:09,217 --> 00:19:12,760
You see that dumpster there?
Seems that dumpster tried to kill you.

267
00:19:12,843 --> 00:19:15,968
You were standing in the middle of the
road, and it was coming right at you.

268
00:19:16,052 --> 00:19:18,468
Just take your time.
Sit up straight. You okay?

269
00:19:20,593 --> 00:19:22,052
You saved...

270
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:24,718
my shoe.

271
00:19:26,052 --> 00:19:27,469
My life.

272
00:19:28,969 --> 00:19:32,053
Your shoe was what I was going for.
Youjust turned out to be a bonus.

273
00:19:32,136 --> 00:19:34,802
Come on. We're gonna try and get up.
Take your time.

274
00:19:34,886 --> 00:19:36,802
Take your time.

275
00:19:36,844 --> 00:19:38,969
Up.

276
00:19:39,053 --> 00:19:41,636
Here we go.
I got you. I got you.

277
00:19:44,054 --> 00:19:46,179
I got you, okay?

278
00:19:48,471 --> 00:19:51,928
You smell like sweet red plums...

279
00:19:51,970 --> 00:19:56,096
and grilled cheese sandwiches.

280
00:19:58,597 --> 00:20:00,679
Okay. Here you go.

281
00:20:03,804 --> 00:20:06,513
Yeah, I get that all the time.
Thank you.

282
00:20:06,597 --> 00:20:10,305
All right. Hold up!
All right.

283
00:20:11,389 --> 00:20:13,348
Yup, she's dead, all right.

284
00:20:13,389 --> 00:20:16,556
- You think she's going to heaven?
- Definitely.

285
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:19,723
She's got the cleanest toes
I've ever seen.

286
00:20:19,805 --> 00:20:21,972
Where am I?

287
00:20:22,056 --> 00:20:25,931
You're at the children's ward
of St. Vincent's Hospital.

288
00:20:26,015 --> 00:20:28,766
I'm your doctor.
Try not to talk.

289
00:20:32,307 --> 00:20:33,432
My God.

290
00:20:33,474 --> 00:20:36,057
I'm paralyzed. I'm paralyzed!

291
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:39,641
If you're moving your arms and legs,
you're clearly not paralyzed.

292
00:20:40,725 --> 00:20:41,892
Boo!

293
00:20:43,808 --> 00:20:45,516
Yes, thank you.
There's my fashlight.

294
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,850
Thank you.
How's our patient doing?

295
00:20:47,933 --> 00:20:51,642
- It was touch and go for a while.
- Was it? What do you recommend?

296
00:20:52,808 --> 00:20:54,725
I think she needs more fuids.

297
00:20:54,808 --> 00:20:57,768
Why don't you go load her up
with 10 cc's of Yoo-Hoo, all right?

298
00:20:57,809 --> 00:20:59,018
Here we go.

299
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:03,851
- You're the guy...
- Steve Edison.

300
00:21:03,935 --> 00:21:06,018
I'm the supervising
pediatrician here.

301
00:21:06,101 --> 00:21:09,434
- Mary...
- Fiore. Yeah, I know.

302
00:21:09,476 --> 00:21:11,769
I had to go through your wallet
to get your identification.

303
00:21:11,810 --> 00:21:14,518
I must say, I've never met anyone who
alphabetized her credit cards before.

304
00:21:16,352 --> 00:21:18,393
Here's the skinny on you.

305
00:21:18,477 --> 00:21:22,102
YourX-rays are fine.
Hemoglobin levels are normal.

306
00:21:22,186 --> 00:21:25,686
We're just waiting on the CAT scan to
be processed, then we can get you out.

307
00:21:25,728 --> 00:21:28,187
You can take this offnow.

308
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:31,811
- Oh, you've got a big neck.
- I have a big neck?

309
00:21:31,895 --> 00:21:34,270
don't get me wrong.
It's a fine neck.

310
00:21:34,353 --> 00:21:37,728
It's just that haven't had a patient
over the age of six in three years.

311
00:21:47,313 --> 00:21:49,396
What happened to your hand?

312
00:21:50,355 --> 00:21:54,396
My hand. You fell on it
with your big neck.

313
00:22:31,566 --> 00:22:34,191
Your CAT scan came back,
and it's all clear.

314
00:22:35,274 --> 00:22:37,233
- So I'm okay?
- You're better than new.

315
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:43,942
Speaking ofnew, that's a pretty
modern girl you have there.

316
00:22:44,025 --> 00:22:46,108
- Who?
- Your girlfriend.

317
00:22:48,067 --> 00:22:52,067
No, that's my sister.
I guess you could say she's modern.

318
00:22:52,150 --> 00:22:55,610
The last time I saw her,
she had a spike through her chin.

319
00:22:55,693 --> 00:22:56,693
Oh, my.

320
00:22:58,068 --> 00:23:00,860
What I don't understand
is how she got near the dumpster!

321
00:23:00,943 --> 00:23:02,485
Miss?

322
00:23:02,568 --> 00:23:05,318
- Oh, my God, you're alive!
- How did you find me?

323
00:23:05,401 --> 00:23:08,945
I'm so happy! The nurse found my
phone number taped to your Palm Pilot.

324
00:23:09,027 --> 00:23:11,653
She told me what happened, and...

325
00:23:13,861 --> 00:23:16,277
Is this the guy who saved you?

326
00:23:18,319 --> 00:23:21,736
I wouldn't exactly
call it a rescue.

327
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:24,362
I was just in the right place
at the right time.

328
00:23:25,195 --> 00:23:28,447
Well, aren't youjust
the modern-day hero?

329
00:23:36,156 --> 00:23:37,364
Are you okay?

330
00:23:42,990 --> 00:23:45,074
Fabulous.

331
00:23:45,157 --> 00:23:47,199
Penny Nicholson.
Nice to meet you.

332
00:23:47,281 --> 00:23:51,199
I'm Steve Edison.
Nice to meet you too.

333
00:23:51,282 --> 00:23:53,950
Have a seat. Make yourself comfortable.
Mary's gonna be fine.

334
00:23:53,991 --> 00:23:58,741
So, you must work long hours.
Are you working late tonight?

335
00:23:58,825 --> 00:24:00,991
No, I'm not even on duty tonight.

336
00:24:01,908 --> 00:24:03,367
Great!

337
00:24:04,699 --> 00:24:07,616
You know, Mary and I were
gonna go to Golden Gate Park.

338
00:24:07,699 --> 00:24:10,201
They show old movies
on the side of the museum.

339
00:24:10,284 --> 00:24:12,159
You should come with us.

340
00:24:12,243 --> 00:24:16,409
- We won't take no for an answer.
- Will you leave him alone, please?

341
00:24:16,492 --> 00:24:18,575
Oh, you don't want me to go?

342
00:24:19,451 --> 00:24:21,951
Of course she wants you to go.

343
00:24:23,327 --> 00:24:27,077
You know, the truth is, doctor...

344
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:30,785
that I've been thinking
about a career in medicine.

345
00:24:30,868 --> 00:24:34,160
Something medicinal or whatnot.

346
00:24:34,202 --> 00:24:37,619
I'd really like to
just pick apart your brain.

347
00:24:37,701 --> 00:24:39,744
- Do not leave me here.
- I know what's best for you.

348
00:24:39,828 --> 00:24:41,744
I'm gonna get you over this Keith thing
once and for all!

349
00:24:41,828 --> 00:24:43,869
It's only been sixyears.

350
00:24:43,953 --> 00:24:45,911
It's not a date!

351
00:24:45,994 --> 00:24:48,328
do not leave me alone. Please.

352
00:24:48,412 --> 00:24:50,662
- It's for your own good.
- Don't you dare!

353
00:24:52,370 --> 00:24:54,413
- There he is.
- There's your gum ball.

354
00:24:54,454 --> 00:24:57,995
Thank you. Oh, good. Boy, you
can never get the colors you want.

355
00:24:58,079 --> 00:24:59,496
Okay, well.

356
00:25:00,663 --> 00:25:02,579
Oh, no!

357
00:25:02,663 --> 00:25:05,162
darn it. I just remembered
that I promised...

358
00:25:05,246 --> 00:25:09,038
my friend's brother's godmother...

359
00:25:09,122 --> 00:25:11,955
that I would help her...

360
00:25:12,038 --> 00:25:14,996
change her fax cartridge tonight...

361
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:18,372
because she's going
out of town tomorrow...

362
00:25:18,414 --> 00:25:20,038
on an African safari.

363
00:25:21,038 --> 00:25:22,956
I should go do that.

364
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:25,665
I'm really sorry that we're not
gonna be able to have that...

365
00:25:25,748 --> 00:25:27,498
- Medical chat.
- Medical chat, yeah.

366
00:25:31,456 --> 00:25:33,957
Okay. Bye.

367
00:25:34,039 --> 00:25:35,832
- Penny.
- Wow.

368
00:25:35,915 --> 00:25:38,041
Goodness, I hope her...

369
00:25:39,165 --> 00:25:43,041
friend's brother's godmother
is gonna be okay.

370
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:45,874
You know,
I have reserved seating.

371
00:25:45,916 --> 00:25:48,207
- All right.
- Okay. Let's go.

372
00:25:50,416 --> 00:25:53,375
- Thanks for guarding my tree.
- Yes, I'm guarding your tree.

373
00:25:53,417 --> 00:25:55,709
There's your blanket right there
under your tree I kept for you.

374
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:58,959
- Thank you, Burt. This is Steve Edison.
- Steve, how you do? Nice to meet you.

375
00:25:59,042 --> 00:26:01,126
- Pleased to meet you.
- It's about time you had a date.

376
00:26:01,209 --> 00:26:03,750
- It's not...
- What line of business are you in?

377
00:26:03,792 --> 00:26:06,417
- I'm a doctor at St. Vincent's.
- You a doctor?

378
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:09,043
He's a doctor.
Well, I get the hint.

379
00:26:09,127 --> 00:26:11,751
See you at the Scrabble
practice, kid.

380
00:26:13,127 --> 00:26:16,501
Sorry. I'm so sorry about that.

381
00:26:16,543 --> 00:26:18,751
Scrabble practice?

382
00:26:18,835 --> 00:26:20,751
Please, don't ask.

383
00:26:20,835 --> 00:26:22,877
Come on. You can't
leave me hanging on that.

384
00:26:22,961 --> 00:26:27,419
"See you at Scrabble practice, kid"?
What's that?

385
00:26:27,502 --> 00:26:29,919
I'm a member of
the BayArea Scrabble Club.

386
00:26:29,961 --> 00:26:32,502
- Pathetic, I know.
- Wow.

387
00:26:32,585 --> 00:26:34,961
- What?
- That is pathetic.

388
00:26:35,003 --> 00:26:37,421
Shut up.

389
00:26:37,462 --> 00:26:40,212
At least I can spell.
What can you do?

390
00:26:40,296 --> 00:26:42,962
- I throw a mean yo-yo.
- You know what?

391
00:26:43,004 --> 00:26:46,546
- No more caramel corn for you.
- I'm serious.

392
00:26:46,628 --> 00:26:49,962
How'd you get into it? I've never met
a member of a Scrabble Club before.

393
00:26:50,045 --> 00:26:51,963
That's for sure.

394
00:26:53,879 --> 00:26:56,879
When my parents came over
from Italy...

395
00:26:56,921 --> 00:26:59,963
the yjoined a Scrabble Club
so they could learn English.

396
00:27:01,046 --> 00:27:05,463
After my mom died, my dad became,
like, obsessed with the game...

397
00:27:05,547 --> 00:27:08,089
and wanted me to play with him
all the time...

398
00:27:08,172 --> 00:27:10,797
so I guess, in a way,
I was destined.

399
00:27:12,131 --> 00:27:14,047
C-O-O-L.

400
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:23,840
What are you doing?

401
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:29,340
I only eat the brown ones.

402
00:27:29,424 --> 00:27:30,841
Because?

403
00:27:32,132 --> 00:27:34,923
'Cause I figure they have
less artificial coloring...

404
00:27:34,965 --> 00:27:38,258
'cause chocolate's already brown.

405
00:27:38,341 --> 00:27:40,550
That's very scientific of you,
dr. Steve.

406
00:27:40,633 --> 00:27:41,800
Thank you.

407
00:27:45,592 --> 00:27:47,717
So where would one go
to see a Scrabble match?

408
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:50,550
Oh, look. It's starting.

409
00:27:56,593 --> 00:28:01,384
Andcloser

410
00:28:01,426 --> 00:28:05,010
tome

411
00:28:10,468 --> 00:28:12,969
- Oh, that'sbeautiful.
- Youlikeit?

412
00:28:13,052 --> 00:28:14,510
Yes.

413
00:28:28,887 --> 00:28:33,179
This is by far the coolest thing
I've ever done in this city.

414
00:28:37,305 --> 00:28:41,598
the closer youare

415
00:28:41,639 --> 00:28:46,098
- The brigh ter the starsglow
- Wanna dance?

416
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:50,891
I don't know. I haven't danced
in quite some time.

417
00:28:50,974 --> 00:28:54,433
- Okay.
- Girl asks you to dance, you dance.

418
00:28:56,849 --> 00:29:00,433
Burt's right.
Yes, Mary, I would love to dance.

419
00:29:01,891 --> 00:29:05,099
- No pressure.
- It's too late now.

420
00:29:13,267 --> 00:29:14,683
Okay.

421
00:29:23,018 --> 00:29:25,976
Where'd you learn
to dance like this?

422
00:29:26,018 --> 00:29:28,143
Ballroom class.

423
00:29:28,185 --> 00:29:30,477
Oh, you're gay.

424
00:29:30,518 --> 00:29:32,809
Oh, yeah, the gayest.

425
00:29:38,352 --> 00:29:41,852
My mother put me
in ballroom classes...

426
00:29:41,935 --> 00:29:43,894
when I was eight years old.

427
00:29:43,935 --> 00:29:47,478
She wanted me to be Fred Astaire.
I wanted to be Marcus Welby.

428
00:29:49,102 --> 00:29:51,812
So now you're
a little bit ofboth?

429
00:29:53,978 --> 00:29:56,103
I think you're being kind.

430
00:29:56,145 --> 00:29:58,978
You can stop that.
I'm gonna blush.

431
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,438
How's your thumb?

432
00:30:06,855 --> 00:30:08,271
Never better.

433
00:30:29,814 --> 00:30:31,689
YMCA.

434
00:30:31,773 --> 00:30:34,481
My next Scrabble match
is Saturday...

435
00:30:34,522 --> 00:30:37,565
at 1:00 at the north side YMCA.

436
00:30:37,648 --> 00:30:40,149
It'll be the social event
of the season.

437
00:30:41,607 --> 00:30:43,857
Maybe you should be there.

438
00:30:47,982 --> 00:30:51,233
- Maybe you shouldn't step on my foot.
- Did I?

439
00:30:51,275 --> 00:30:52,816
- Yes.
- I'm sorry.

440
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:55,025
That's okay.
Just don't let it happen again.

441
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:58,357
don't tell me what to do.

442
00:30:58,441 --> 00:30:59,858
don't what?

443
00:31:36,487 --> 00:31:38,111
Holy shit!

444
00:31:38,195 --> 00:31:40,612
Are you guys crazy?
This isn't funny!

445
00:31:40,694 --> 00:31:44,278
I am thinking teal for the bridesmaids.
What do you think?

446
00:31:46,612 --> 00:31:48,945
Good morning. Earth to Mary.

447
00:31:49,029 --> 00:31:51,529
What is up with you?
You're different.

448
00:31:51,613 --> 00:31:54,112
I'm not different.
How am I different?

449
00:31:54,196 --> 00:31:56,196
You can't stop smiling.

450
00:31:57,613 --> 00:31:59,613
I'm not smiling.
Am I smiling?

451
00:31:59,696 --> 00:32:01,945
Like a fool.

452
00:32:02,029 --> 00:32:04,364
- Tell me.
- It's nothing.

453
00:32:04,447 --> 00:32:06,946
Then stop smiling.

454
00:32:07,030 --> 00:32:09,739
- I can't.
- Okay, who is he?

455
00:32:14,905 --> 00:32:16,864
Okay. No, no!

456
00:32:16,946 --> 00:32:20,239
Mr. Kotsioupolis, you cannot throw
plates at the Ritz-fucking-Carlton!

457
00:32:21,323 --> 00:32:22,490
It's okay.

458
00:32:22,573 --> 00:32:24,323
This is like a fairy tale.

459
00:32:24,406 --> 00:32:26,907
He saves your life.
You dance under the stars.

460
00:32:26,989 --> 00:32:29,698
- You kiss in the rain.
- Almost kissed.

461
00:32:29,782 --> 00:32:33,866
I don't know, Fran. I've been so out
of the dating-relationship loop.

462
00:32:33,949 --> 00:32:35,282
You?

463
00:32:35,324 --> 00:32:39,532
You know, those who can't do, teach?
Those who can't wed, plan.

464
00:32:39,616 --> 00:32:42,532
With my help, you could marry
this man in three months.

465
00:32:43,407 --> 00:32:46,658
I have totally lost control.
Will you please, please, please help me?

466
00:32:46,741 --> 00:32:48,617
Penny, if you can't beat 'em...

467
00:32:49,742 --> 00:32:52,450
- What has gotten into you?
- She met a guy.

468
00:32:52,533 --> 00:32:55,367
You met a guy? You mean...

469
00:33:00,659 --> 00:33:03,868
- I wanna hear all about it!
- I owe you one, Penny.

470
00:33:03,952 --> 00:33:06,035
You do. You owe me one!

471
00:33:08,284 --> 00:33:11,202
- Hello, Rene. How are you?
- Great.

472
00:33:11,285 --> 00:33:13,701
Listen, they're gonna be
signing up for six classes.

473
00:33:13,785 --> 00:33:16,451
Sojust be sure
to pay up front, okay?

474
00:33:16,493 --> 00:33:18,702
Basil himself
is gonna be here today.

475
00:33:18,786 --> 00:33:20,702
- Really?
- Yes.

476
00:33:22,702 --> 00:33:25,203
I'll have to call you back.
Okay. Bye.

477
00:33:26,619 --> 00:33:28,869
Mary, what are you doing here?

478
00:33:28,953 --> 00:33:31,328
Oh, my God.
I'm so embarrassed.

479
00:33:31,411 --> 00:33:33,329
I may be a hell
of a businesswoman...

480
00:33:33,412 --> 00:33:36,371
but when I dance,
I look like a retarded string bean.

481
00:33:36,454 --> 00:33:38,454
I thought your class
wasn't till Thursday though.

482
00:33:38,536 --> 00:33:41,246
I know. We had to change it.
But this is perfect.

483
00:33:41,287 --> 00:33:44,662
You can finally meet Eddie.
Come here. Eddie.

484
00:33:44,745 --> 00:33:46,662
Eddie, come here.

485
00:33:46,745 --> 00:33:48,788
I want you to meet
the wedding planner.

486
00:33:48,829 --> 00:33:51,538
The two most important people
in my life set eyes on one another.

487
00:33:51,621 --> 00:33:54,040
Eddie, this is Mary,
the wedding planner.

488
00:33:54,831 --> 00:33:56,748
Mary, this is my fiance Eddie.

489
00:34:09,874 --> 00:34:13,583
- Mary, are you okay?
- Uh-huh. Yup. Good.

490
00:34:16,208 --> 00:34:17,917
Let's see who that is.

491
00:34:20,584 --> 00:34:22,584
Hi, dad. Wait.

492
00:34:22,668 --> 00:34:25,459
I can't hear you. Hang on.
All right. Okay, I got you.

493
00:34:26,875 --> 00:34:29,209
Okay, I'm losing you again.
I'm sorry.

494
00:34:29,251 --> 00:34:32,585
Shoot. Okay, wait, wait.
Hello. Do you hear me?

495
00:34:32,669 --> 00:34:32,835
Quickly, people.
Get your tootsies out here, pronto.

496
00:34:32,835 --> 00:34:35,794
Quickly, people.
Get your tootsies out here, pronto.

497
00:34:35,877 --> 00:34:38,877
Welcome to the Basil St. Mosely
School of dance.

498
00:34:38,919 --> 00:34:41,377
I am Basil St. Mosely.

499
00:34:41,418 --> 00:34:44,126
Hang on. I can't hear you.
Wait a second. I can't hear you.

500
00:34:44,210 --> 00:34:46,418
You're breaking up. Hang on.

501
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:47,920
There you go.

502
00:34:47,962 --> 00:34:51,628
I'd like all my lovely couples,
dancing partners, paired up in twos...

503
00:34:51,670 --> 00:34:53,837
ready to dance, not next week,
not tomorrow, but now.

504
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:55,837
- Dance with Eddie.
- I can't.

505
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:58,169
Quickly.
Is there a problem in the room?

506
00:34:58,211 --> 00:35:01,336
Pronto, people. I'd like us to still
be young when this class is over.

507
00:35:01,378 --> 00:35:03,004
I have to take this call.

508
00:35:03,046 --> 00:35:05,337
darling, I understand you're busy.
I'm busy too.

509
00:35:05,379 --> 00:35:07,546
- You're holding up the class.
- She's with him.

510
00:35:07,629 --> 00:35:08,879
All right.

511
00:35:08,963 --> 00:35:12,129
Mary, watch out for his thumb.
He hurt it saving some old lady.

512
00:35:12,212 --> 00:35:14,754
- Sorry, I can't.
- Listen, I got a prior engagement.

513
00:35:14,838 --> 00:35:16,796
Interesting choice of words.

514
00:35:16,839 --> 00:35:19,089
Wallfowers,
it's time to blossom and bloom.

515
00:35:19,172 --> 00:35:22,839
Obviously, what we have here, people,
is a fear ofdancing.

516
00:35:22,922 --> 00:35:26,630
It's my firm belief
we must conquer one's fears.

517
00:35:26,713 --> 00:35:29,922
Now, I have to gauge
what I am dealing with...

518
00:35:30,005 --> 00:35:32,673
so I will play music,
you will dance...

519
00:35:32,714 --> 00:35:34,464
and I will observe.

520
00:35:34,548 --> 00:35:35,631
Okay, Rene?

521
00:35:35,714 --> 00:35:35,881
Yes, thank you.

522
00:35:35,881 --> 00:35:37,631
Yes, thank you.

523
00:35:39,257 --> 00:35:41,589
Mary, would you like to dance?

524
00:35:41,673 --> 00:35:43,881
Have no fear. Dance. Dance.

525
00:35:45,257 --> 00:35:46,674
Yes.

526
00:35:49,007 --> 00:35:51,590
- Old lady, huh?
- Listen, this is...

527
00:35:51,674 --> 00:35:53,966
- You told me your name was Steve.
- It is Steve.

528
00:35:54,007 --> 00:35:56,590
My last name is Edison.
Fran calls me Eddie. It's a nickname.

529
00:35:56,674 --> 00:36:00,049
I have a better nickname for you.
How about common, cheating, sleazy...

530
00:36:00,133 --> 00:36:01,216
If you're thinking...

531
00:36:01,299 --> 00:36:04,008
What I'm thinking involves
a machete and a pair ofpliers.

532
00:36:04,050 --> 00:36:05,134
Okay.

533
00:36:09,551 --> 00:36:12,134
- The day that you had the accident.
- That was a special day.

534
00:36:12,217 --> 00:36:13,509
It was. I was running late.

535
00:36:13,592 --> 00:36:15,217
How convenient.

536
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:18,634
I was meeting Fran and our wedding
planner, which you turned out to be.

537
00:36:18,717 --> 00:36:20,593
What are the odds?

538
00:36:20,635 --> 00:36:22,801
dance. Dance!

539
00:36:25,051 --> 00:36:28,801
don't dance around the issue. You didn't
show 'cause you don't wanna get married.

540
00:36:28,884 --> 00:36:31,844
- I see it all the time.
- You see what?

541
00:36:31,927 --> 00:36:34,969
Why'd you tell your fiancee
you saved an old lady?

542
00:36:35,052 --> 00:36:36,927
Exactly!

543
00:36:37,010 --> 00:36:39,844
You think you want to get married,
but you don't.

544
00:36:39,885 --> 00:36:43,344
You're pitiful and confused, looking
to get some hot pepper wherever you can.

545
00:36:43,386 --> 00:36:46,011
Mary, you have no idea
what you're talking about.

546
00:36:46,053 --> 00:36:47,262
Yeah?

547
00:36:47,345 --> 00:36:48,928
Why did you go
to the movies with me?

548
00:36:49,011 --> 00:36:51,679
Why did Steve go to the movies
with you? Let's see.

549
00:36:51,762 --> 00:36:54,095
First of all,
Steve likes the movies.

550
00:36:54,178 --> 00:36:55,762
Steve had the night off.

551
00:36:55,846 --> 00:36:57,928
Steve said, "Hey, you know what?

552
00:36:58,011 --> 00:37:00,971
A movie sounds good."
Plus he got an invitation.

553
00:37:01,012 --> 00:37:03,221
Why is Steve referring to himself
in the third person?

554
00:37:03,304 --> 00:37:05,221
What are you talking about?

555
00:37:05,304 --> 00:37:08,972
Think you can double-talk your way out,
throw me off your scent? I smell you!

556
00:37:09,012 --> 00:37:11,680
And I smell like sweet red plums
and grilled cheese sandwiches.

557
00:37:11,763 --> 00:37:13,179
- What?
- Yes.

558
00:37:13,221 --> 00:37:15,764
- So you said before you passed out.
- I did not!

559
00:37:15,848 --> 00:37:18,806
You did too. If anybody was
looking to get some, it's M-A-R-Y.

560
00:37:18,889 --> 00:37:20,514
You are hideous.

561
00:37:20,597 --> 00:37:22,973
Okay. Then why'd you
ask me to dance?

562
00:37:23,056 --> 00:37:24,556
- I didn't.
- You did too.

563
00:37:24,597 --> 00:37:26,931
- I did not.
- You said, "Would you like to dance?"

564
00:37:27,014 --> 00:37:30,807
And even if I did,
I'm not the one who's engaged.

565
00:37:30,890 --> 00:37:32,807
It was a dance.

566
00:37:32,890 --> 00:37:34,974
Whoop-dee-doo.
It didn't mean anything.

567
00:37:36,141 --> 00:37:37,765
Then why'd you almost kiss me?

568
00:37:40,515 --> 00:37:43,265
This pair, this lovely couple...

569
00:37:43,348 --> 00:37:46,017
they have it,
they know what it takes.

570
00:37:47,558 --> 00:37:49,683
Very well done.

571
00:37:51,142 --> 00:37:52,349
We need to powwow.

572
00:37:55,683 --> 00:37:58,225
As soon as dad mentioned it,
I went, "Of course."

573
00:37:58,308 --> 00:38:01,268
Everybody knows that
it's the place to get married.

574
00:38:01,309 --> 00:38:04,018
Sure, Fran.
A vineyard sounds perfect.

575
00:38:04,101 --> 00:38:06,351
- We should check it out right away.
- I already have.

576
00:38:06,434 --> 00:38:10,600
We have reservations for this weekend,
but you'll have to take off Friday.

577
00:38:10,684 --> 00:38:14,517
Friday? Friday's not good for me.
I have a diverticulitis seminar planned.

578
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:17,852
- Okay. Saturday.
- Saturday.

579
00:38:17,935 --> 00:38:20,893
Saturday. All right, Mary?
Thanks for everything.

580
00:38:20,935 --> 00:38:23,394
Nice to meet you. Thanks for the dance.
We'll let you know how it all goes.

581
00:38:23,436 --> 00:38:26,727
- Pleasure to meet you.
- Wait a second. She's coming with us.

582
00:38:26,768 --> 00:38:28,352
- I'm coming?
- She's comin'?

583
00:38:28,436 --> 00:38:29,394
Yes.

584
00:38:29,477 --> 00:38:31,520
You are not quitting
the donolly wedding!

585
00:38:32,936 --> 00:38:35,312
I gotta tell Geri
I'm off the account.

586
00:38:36,395 --> 00:38:37,562
Hold on.

587
00:38:37,644 --> 00:38:39,270
Listen...

588
00:38:39,353 --> 00:38:43,811
the only good reason to quit a wedding
is if you break the cardinal rule...

589
00:38:43,853 --> 00:38:47,438
which is ridiculous because we both know
you did not fall in love with the groom.

590
00:38:48,604 --> 00:38:49,563
What?

591
00:38:51,688 --> 00:38:53,229
You didn't.

592
00:38:54,937 --> 00:38:56,688
Bad.

593
00:38:56,770 --> 00:38:58,730
No, of course not.

594
00:38:59,896 --> 00:39:02,896
I'd never get emotionally involved.

595
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:05,105
Never. Never.

596
00:39:06,274 --> 00:39:07,566
It's the doctor.

597
00:39:09,232 --> 00:39:12,190
I'm confused. Is it the doctor,
or did you fall for the groom?

598
00:39:12,274 --> 00:39:16,108
No, the doctor is the groom.
The groom is the doctor.

599
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:18,650
The doctor is Fran donolly's fiance!

600
00:39:18,692 --> 00:39:21,108
The dumpster girl
is your wedding planner?

601
00:39:21,191 --> 00:39:23,108
Yes. I'm in hell.

602
00:39:23,191 --> 00:39:25,275
And I'm in heaven.
Now you can fix me up with her.

603
00:39:25,358 --> 00:39:28,609
I'm not fixing you up, dr. John.
Look, this is complicated enough.

604
00:39:28,692 --> 00:39:31,693
You are one of the top
wedding planners...

605
00:39:31,735 --> 00:39:35,693
in this great, big,
thriving metropolis.

606
00:39:35,776 --> 00:39:38,735
Look on the positive side.
He got you to open up again.

607
00:39:38,818 --> 00:39:40,776
Thank the bastard and move on.

608
00:39:40,818 --> 00:39:43,943
You cannot tell me you would sacrifice
your entire career over this!

609
00:39:43,985 --> 00:39:47,569
You're not telling me that you think
it's a mistake to marry Fran now?

610
00:39:47,652 --> 00:39:50,485
I don't think it's a mistake
to marry Fran. Fran is great.

611
00:39:50,569 --> 00:39:52,319
Yes.

612
00:39:53,777 --> 00:39:55,694
It's just that...

613
00:39:57,861 --> 00:40:00,820
what if what I think is great
really is great...

614
00:40:02,695 --> 00:40:06,112
but it's not as great
as something greater?

615
00:40:07,528 --> 00:40:09,278
You will go through
with this wedding!

616
00:40:09,361 --> 00:40:10,653
Why?

617
00:40:10,737 --> 00:40:14,654
Because you deserve this partnership.
You've earned it!

618
00:40:14,738 --> 00:40:16,738
- You're right.
- Of course I'm right.

619
00:40:16,821 --> 00:40:18,322
Of course you're right.

620
00:40:18,404 --> 00:40:21,322
Your feelings for her,
that's not chemistry, that's anxiety.

621
00:40:21,363 --> 00:40:23,905
- It's nature.
- It's natural.

622
00:40:23,988 --> 00:40:27,363
Natural. It's not chemistry,
it's anxiety.

623
00:40:27,446 --> 00:40:29,614
I can do this.
I can plan this wedding.

624
00:40:29,697 --> 00:40:32,031
The feelings I have for Fran
run deep.

625
00:40:32,072 --> 00:40:34,989
It's not something that can be swept
away in one night with one dance.

626
00:40:35,072 --> 00:40:36,989
Not gonna happen.

627
00:40:37,072 --> 00:40:38,989
- What the hell was I thinking?
- You were thinking wrong.

628
00:40:39,072 --> 00:40:41,989
I was thinking wrong.
I was being a jackass. Come on, Steve.

629
00:40:42,072 --> 00:40:45,656
I can treat that jackass
like any other faceless groom.

630
00:40:45,740 --> 00:40:47,907
That's just what I'm gonna do.
Why?

631
00:40:47,948 --> 00:40:51,282
Because he's nothing!
Because I love a challenge!

632
00:40:51,324 --> 00:40:53,698
And because I am
a goddamn professional!

633
00:40:55,990 --> 00:40:58,866
- So you're gonna give me her number?
- No, I'm not.

634
00:41:04,492 --> 00:41:06,782
I thought that we had
everything covered...

635
00:41:06,866 --> 00:41:10,866
but then I realized Eddie and I
don't have a wedding song.

636
00:41:10,908 --> 00:41:14,909
So I got this wedding compilation
to see if we can find one.

637
00:41:16,950 --> 00:41:18,867
Okay, here we go.

638
00:41:23,867 --> 00:41:26,367
- What do you think?
- That's groovy.

639
00:41:26,451 --> 00:41:29,452
- I like it.
- Let's see what else there is.

640
00:41:30,702 --> 00:41:34,035
You fill up my senses

641
00:41:35,202 --> 00:41:38,577
- What do you think of this one?
- That's groovy too. I like it.

642
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:39,911
It's kinda cute.

643
00:41:39,993 --> 00:41:41,243
Kinda not.

644
00:41:45,411 --> 00:41:47,077
Ilove you

645
00:41:47,161 --> 00:41:48,453
Oh, my God.

646
00:41:48,536 --> 00:41:51,161
Olivia Newton-John.
I love this song.

647
00:41:51,244 --> 00:41:53,828
- Ihonestlylove you
- This is perfect, isn't it?

648
00:41:53,912 --> 00:41:56,411
Yes, it is perfect.

649
00:41:56,495 --> 00:41:58,245
- It is.
- Yes.

650
00:41:58,329 --> 00:41:59,412
What?

651
00:42:01,287 --> 00:42:03,079
Nothing. It's nothing.

652
00:42:03,162 --> 00:42:07,162
- What, is it a bad song?
- No, I think it's absolutely perfect.

653
00:42:07,245 --> 00:42:09,245
- See? It's perfect.
- It's perfect?

654
00:42:09,329 --> 00:42:11,287
Yes, it is.
It's perfect.

655
00:42:11,370 --> 00:42:13,872
You think so?
We have a song!

656
00:42:13,955 --> 00:42:16,705
I can't believe it.
We have a song.

657
00:42:16,747 --> 00:42:18,622
Ilove you

658
00:42:18,705 --> 00:42:21,622
Ihonestlylove you

659
00:42:21,705 --> 00:42:23,622
What's that, like, 1 983?

660
00:42:26,330 --> 00:42:29,915
Oh, I've been meaning to ask you,
speaking oflove...

661
00:42:29,998 --> 00:42:31,915
what happened to that guy?

662
00:42:31,998 --> 00:42:34,165
You know, the one
that you danced with...

663
00:42:37,581 --> 00:42:40,165
There was a damn deer in the road.

664
00:42:41,706 --> 00:42:42,665
damn it.

665
00:42:43,832 --> 00:42:44,999
Careful.

666
00:42:47,124 --> 00:42:49,582
So, what happened?

667
00:42:51,499 --> 00:42:54,166
- Didn't work out.
- How is that possible?

668
00:42:54,249 --> 00:42:57,833
I saw you three days later,
and you still had stars in your eyes.

669
00:43:02,042 --> 00:43:07,000
Well, he turned out to be the groom
of one of the weddings I was planning.

670
00:43:09,250 --> 00:43:10,666
Yes.

671
00:43:10,708 --> 00:43:13,335
That is the most disgusting thing
I have ever heard.

672
00:43:14,210 --> 00:43:18,293
I would hate to be a single gal with all
those creeps running around out there.

673
00:43:18,377 --> 00:43:21,126
Yeah, Fran, you're really lucky.

674
00:43:21,210 --> 00:43:24,793
Ilove you

675
00:43:28,919 --> 00:43:32,503
Ihonestlylove you

676
00:43:42,253 --> 00:43:42,420
I suppose they'd like to see the gardens
first. Don't you think, Mary?

677
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:46,170
I suppose they'd like to see the gardens
first. Don't you think, Mary?

678
00:43:46,253 --> 00:43:49,837
Over here is where the actual ceremony
would take place.

679
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:54,545
What are you doing here?

680
00:43:54,629 --> 00:43:57,921
Your papa tell me where you are,
so I come to surprise you.

681
00:43:57,962 --> 00:44:00,588
I made this for you.

682
00:44:01,838 --> 00:44:03,046
And who is this?

683
00:44:03,838 --> 00:44:06,505
- I'm her fiance.
- What?

684
00:44:06,588 --> 00:44:07,672
Her fiance?

685
00:44:08,630 --> 00:44:11,588
- Buongiorno. I am Massimo.
- I'm Steve.

686
00:44:11,673 --> 00:44:13,006
And I'm Fran.

687
00:44:13,089 --> 00:44:17,381
Oh, my God, Mary, I cannot believe
you didn't tell us you were engaged.

688
00:44:17,464 --> 00:44:18,758
Mary, you're engaged!

689
00:44:18,841 --> 00:44:20,800
That's marvelous!

690
00:44:20,883 --> 00:44:25,466
After all the weddings we've done
together, now finally it's your turn.

691
00:44:25,549 --> 00:44:28,217
- And I am her fiance.
- Congratulations.

692
00:44:28,258 --> 00:44:32,093
We're gonna have to plan something
very special this weekend to celebrate.

693
00:44:32,175 --> 00:44:35,759
- It won't be necessary.
- Yes, it will, because it is wonderful.

694
00:44:35,842 --> 00:44:37,300
It is wonderful.

695
00:44:37,342 --> 00:44:40,842
You've found that somebody special
in your life...

696
00:44:40,926 --> 00:44:42,843
to be honest and faithful to...

697
00:44:42,927 --> 00:44:45,219
until the end of time,
no matter what.

698
00:44:46,885 --> 00:44:49,052
You must take that moment, Mary.

699
00:44:50,927 --> 00:44:52,885
And I am her fiance.

700
00:44:57,011 --> 00:45:00,345
- We're ready for our tour now.
- Certainly. Just follow me.

701
00:45:00,427 --> 00:45:01,844
Wow.

702
00:45:03,469 --> 00:45:08,761
This wedding putting-together
is not a job for a man.

703
00:45:08,803 --> 00:45:11,637
You stay with me
and we will do the manly bonding.

704
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:15,096
Manly bonding.
You and me.

705
00:45:15,137 --> 00:45:18,096
We'll let the ladies...
I mean, the brides-to-be...

706
00:45:18,179 --> 00:45:20,595
we'll let them go do their thing.

707
00:45:20,679 --> 00:45:21,929
Bye-bye, girls.

708
00:45:24,304 --> 00:45:26,721
How cute is he?

709
00:45:26,763 --> 00:45:28,846
He's so cute.

710
00:45:28,888 --> 00:45:31,555
How long you known Mary?

711
00:45:31,638 --> 00:45:33,680
Way before she had the breasts.

712
00:45:33,763 --> 00:45:37,597
Believe me, back then
she did not look so good.

713
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:41,931
Look. A center
for the physical fitness.

714
00:45:42,014 --> 00:45:43,973
We do the bonding.
Follow me.

715
00:45:44,014 --> 00:45:45,973
We do the bonding.

716
00:46:02,432 --> 00:46:04,391
Take it easy there, buddy.

717
00:46:04,432 --> 00:46:07,558
- I like the speed.
- You like the speed.

718
00:46:09,474 --> 00:46:10,559
Faster.

719
00:46:14,141 --> 00:46:15,058
Run!

720
00:46:20,267 --> 00:46:21,517
Run like a man!

721
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:23,016
Like me!

722
00:46:26,434 --> 00:46:27,851
Well, here we are.

723
00:46:29,518 --> 00:46:32,643
Hi, bunny.
Wedding woman.

724
00:46:32,726 --> 00:46:34,643
Mr. Donolly.
Hello, Mrs. Donolly.

725
00:46:34,726 --> 00:46:36,643
What took you guys so long?

726
00:46:36,726 --> 00:46:39,977
We found seven of the most
adorable vineyards on the way up.

727
00:46:40,060 --> 00:46:42,602
- Right by the side of the road.
- All you can drink.

728
00:46:42,686 --> 00:46:45,561
- Really? Great.
- Oh, honey, do you mind?

729
00:46:46,435 --> 00:46:49,103
- How many is that for you?
- Sixty-five.

730
00:46:49,185 --> 00:46:50,644
And you?

731
00:46:50,686 --> 00:46:52,769
- How many?
- Sixty-five.

732
00:46:54,144 --> 00:46:56,062
Same.

733
00:46:56,145 --> 00:46:57,895
Sixty-seven.

734
00:47:00,436 --> 00:47:05,311
Another plus is that their chefis rated
one of the three best on the West Coast.

735
00:47:05,395 --> 00:47:07,520
I really like it, dad.

736
00:47:07,603 --> 00:47:10,105
You know who else was married here?
LesleyAnn Martin.

737
00:47:10,188 --> 00:47:13,105
Herb Martin's daughter?
Forget it. This place is out.

738
00:47:13,188 --> 00:47:16,105
I'm not following
in Herb Martin's shoddy footsteps.

739
00:47:16,188 --> 00:47:19,272
- I didn't see a stage either.
- Find something bigger.

740
00:47:19,354 --> 00:47:20,771
Eddie, what on earth...

741
00:47:25,522 --> 00:47:26,772
What are you doing?

742
00:47:26,856 --> 00:47:28,398
Yeah, just a second.

743
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:34,398
Good move, honey.

744
00:47:40,065 --> 00:47:42,565
From this valley

745
00:47:42,606 --> 00:47:45,565
they say youareleavin'

746
00:47:45,648 --> 00:47:46,982
It's "going," honey.

747
00:47:47,065 --> 00:47:48,149
Whatever, darling.

748
00:47:48,232 --> 00:47:52,232
Ishallmissyourbrighteyes

749
00:47:52,274 --> 00:47:53,815
Andsweetsmile

750
00:47:57,108 --> 00:48:01,483
I'm starting a nonprofit pediatric
foundation. I want Eddie to head it up.

751
00:48:01,567 --> 00:48:04,774
Can you imagine Eddie CEO
of a major medical foundation?

752
00:48:04,858 --> 00:48:06,816
He wants to
give up his patients?

753
00:48:06,899 --> 00:48:08,858
He does.
He just doesn't know it yet.

754
00:48:08,899 --> 00:48:11,192
He has a hard time
leaving people behind.

755
00:48:11,234 --> 00:48:13,192
Always do the right thing.

756
00:48:14,693 --> 00:48:18,484
I'm sure he doesn't always
do the right thing.

757
00:48:18,568 --> 00:48:18,734
Just the something something

758
00:48:18,734 --> 00:48:20,734
Just the something something

759
00:48:20,817 --> 00:48:24,652
Red River Valley

760
00:48:24,735 --> 00:48:27,152
Mom, would you please shut up!

761
00:48:28,777 --> 00:48:31,652
Whoa! Heel, boy!
Heel! Heel!

762
00:48:38,402 --> 00:48:40,236
Pull on the reins!

763
00:48:46,445 --> 00:48:48,486
Stop! Oh, God!

764
00:48:48,570 --> 00:48:50,903
Horsey! Horsey! Horsey!

765
00:48:50,987 --> 00:48:52,236
Oh, God.

766
00:48:55,946 --> 00:48:57,362
Oh, God.

767
00:49:03,654 --> 00:49:05,071
Tree! Tree!

768
00:49:06,738 --> 00:49:08,154
Hang on, Mary!

769
00:49:08,237 --> 00:49:10,697
I got you! I got you!

770
00:49:11,780 --> 00:49:15,238
On the count of three.
One, two, three!

771
00:49:23,656 --> 00:49:25,198
You okay?

772
00:49:41,993 --> 00:49:44,951
Oh, my God.
You could've been killed.

773
00:49:45,035 --> 00:49:48,243
- It's important to learn how to ride.
- Yeah.

774
00:49:48,326 --> 00:49:51,410
- Eddie, you're riding backwith Mary.
- No, no, really.

775
00:49:51,492 --> 00:49:53,411
don't let her out of your sight.

776
00:49:53,493 --> 00:49:56,493
And the good news is,
I have the wine!

777
00:50:00,952 --> 00:50:03,411
As I walkedouton

778
00:50:03,494 --> 00:50:07,119
thestreets of Laredo

779
00:50:18,537 --> 00:50:21,870
- Thank you for what you did.
- No problem.

780
00:50:23,496 --> 00:50:25,912
You don't have to be
all smug about it.

781
00:50:28,246 --> 00:50:31,496
How about a quick recap here, Mary?

782
00:50:31,580 --> 00:50:34,246
You harpoon me for being engaged...

783
00:50:34,330 --> 00:50:40,164
when, in a zippy and unexpected twist,
you yourself turn out to have a fiance.

784
00:50:40,247 --> 00:50:42,872
Now you have the nerve
to call me smug?

785
00:50:42,955 --> 00:50:45,789
Come on, Mary.
What the hell is your problem?

786
00:50:45,830 --> 00:50:47,789
You're the one with the problem.

787
00:50:47,831 --> 00:50:49,955
I've been doing this a long time...

788
00:50:50,039 --> 00:50:53,332
and I can predict down to the week
how long a couple's going to last.

789
00:50:53,373 --> 00:50:57,540
Are you aware that Fran
has chosen teal for her bridesmaids?

790
00:50:57,582 --> 00:51:00,290
Teal, the color of gangrene.

791
00:51:00,373 --> 00:51:04,582
My last bride who chose teal
got her marriage annulled in 1 2 days.

792
00:51:04,665 --> 00:51:08,791
Oh, oh, and "I Honestly Love You"
as your wedding song?

793
00:51:08,875 --> 00:51:10,958
You might as well commit
matrimonial suicide right now.

794
00:51:12,458 --> 00:51:15,124
You want a confession in blood?
Huh? All right.

795
00:51:15,207 --> 00:51:18,458
That night at the movie,
I was attracted to you.

796
00:51:18,541 --> 00:51:21,416
I was. You caught me.
I admit it.

797
00:51:21,499 --> 00:51:25,751
I mean, let's see, maybe I was a little
unsure about the whole marriage thing.

798
00:51:25,834 --> 00:51:29,084
I don't know,
maybe I was just being a guy...

799
00:51:29,167 --> 00:51:31,709
and an opportunity presented itself.

800
00:51:31,792 --> 00:51:33,084
Bottom line?

801
00:51:33,167 --> 00:51:35,500
I never thought
I'd see you again.

802
00:51:35,584 --> 00:51:38,418
Bottom line?
Nothing happened.

803
00:51:39,793 --> 00:51:41,251
Bottom line?

804
00:51:41,335 --> 00:51:45,710
Now, more than ever,
I believe Fran is the one for me.

805
00:51:47,585 --> 00:51:48,668
So...

806
00:51:48,752 --> 00:51:52,294
I would say,
based on the evidence...

807
00:51:52,336 --> 00:51:56,711
all your theories on love sound like
the rantings of a bitter, cynical woman.

808
00:52:00,878 --> 00:52:06,086
Once I walkedout
on thestreets ofLaredo

809
00:52:06,170 --> 00:52:08,545
AndLaredo walkedout

810
00:52:08,587 --> 00:52:11,545
On thestreets withme

811
00:52:32,755 --> 00:52:34,214
Excuse me.

812
00:52:34,297 --> 00:52:36,214
There's my good boy.

813
00:52:56,798 --> 00:52:58,798
What's going on?

814
00:52:58,882 --> 00:53:02,882
I am measuring you
for your wedding dress.

815
00:53:02,965 --> 00:53:06,174
dad, I want my house key back.
dad, dad, please.

816
00:53:07,592 --> 00:53:09,883
Where's that old wedding dress?

817
00:53:09,925 --> 00:53:12,966
Now we can finally
get rid of this.

818
00:53:13,050 --> 00:53:15,008
dad, put that back!

819
00:53:15,091 --> 00:53:18,008
Hey, Mary,
what do you want on your bagel?

820
00:53:18,091 --> 00:53:20,800
No bagel. No wedding dress.
No wedding.

821
00:53:20,884 --> 00:53:21,801
No wedding?

822
00:53:23,134 --> 00:53:26,051
But Massimo said
you announced your engagement.

823
00:53:26,134 --> 00:53:28,051
I never said that.

824
00:53:28,134 --> 00:53:31,468
My God, this is like
the blind date that wouldn't end.

825
00:53:32,802 --> 00:53:33,968
He's right.

826
00:53:34,010 --> 00:53:38,052
You're frightened by
a mounting attraction for him.

827
00:53:38,135 --> 00:53:39,803
Oh, that's disgusting.

828
00:53:40,886 --> 00:53:44,761
- I told you Mismo was full of crap.
- No Mismo! Massimo!

829
00:53:44,844 --> 00:53:46,469
Go toast the bagel.

830
00:53:46,552 --> 00:53:49,053
Yeah, I'll toast when I see fit.

831
00:53:49,094 --> 00:53:51,553
Mismo, Massimo
or any other kind of"mo."

832
00:53:51,595 --> 00:53:54,386
dad, you cannot
push some guy at me.

833
00:53:54,470 --> 00:53:56,386
That's not how it works.

834
00:53:56,470 --> 00:53:58,386
You know that.
You had Ma.

835
00:53:58,470 --> 00:54:01,970
Yes, and I didn't meet her
until the day of our wedding.

836
00:54:02,054 --> 00:54:03,637
What are you talking about?

837
00:54:05,512 --> 00:54:08,846
Your mother and I
had an arranged marriage.

838
00:54:10,222 --> 00:54:12,346
An arranged marriage?

839
00:54:14,471 --> 00:54:17,554
Wemeton the dayof our wedding.

840
00:54:17,638 --> 00:54:20,055
We couldn't even look at each other.

841
00:54:20,097 --> 00:54:22,597
I was in love
with another girl...

842
00:54:22,639 --> 00:54:26,931
and your mother
wanted nothing to do with me.

843
00:54:27,014 --> 00:54:30,972
She said I had big eyebrows
and a low IQ

844
00:54:32,014 --> 00:54:34,098
Anyway, one day...

845
00:54:34,181 --> 00:54:38,307
I got very sick
with scarlet fever...

846
00:54:39,515 --> 00:54:42,224
and she stayed by my side.

847
00:54:42,307 --> 00:54:44,226
She took good care of me.

848
00:54:45,809 --> 00:54:48,267
For the first time...

849
00:54:48,351 --> 00:54:50,267
I appreciated her.

850
00:54:51,435 --> 00:54:54,394
Then the appreciation
grew to respect.

851
00:54:55,726 --> 00:54:58,143
Respect grew to like.

852
00:54:59,602 --> 00:55:02,851
Then like grew to love.

853
00:55:04,310 --> 00:55:07,269
A deeper love
than I could ever hope for.

854
00:55:10,769 --> 00:55:13,436
So give Massimo a chance.

855
00:55:14,977 --> 00:55:16,936
Maybe you don't like him now...

856
00:55:17,019 --> 00:55:20,229
but maybe
you might love him later.

857
00:55:21,312 --> 00:55:26,270
I should've told you about
your mother and I a long time ago.

858
00:55:26,312 --> 00:55:29,396
Maybe then you'd feel
differently about love.

859
00:55:33,479 --> 00:55:35,938
I don't feel anything about love.

860
00:55:40,397 --> 00:55:42,313
What do you think, Mary?

861
00:55:45,146 --> 00:55:47,063
Oh, the park's great.

862
00:55:48,188 --> 00:55:52,022
You guys would be the first. No one
else has been married here before.

863
00:55:56,856 --> 00:56:00,356
Well, we'd have to construct
the site from scratch...

864
00:56:00,439 --> 00:56:03,856
but at least you wouldn't
have to cut the guest list.

865
00:56:03,940 --> 00:56:06,357
dad would love it.

866
00:56:06,440 --> 00:56:08,941
And what about
the bride and groom-to-be?

867
00:56:09,024 --> 00:56:12,482
- I say, let's take it.
- I thinkwe should keep looking.

868
00:56:12,524 --> 00:56:15,482
- Really?
- Maybe I should give you guys a minute.

869
00:56:16,857 --> 00:56:18,315
You don't like it?

870
00:56:21,109 --> 00:56:22,650
I don't know.

871
00:56:22,733 --> 00:56:24,192
Come on.

872
00:56:28,733 --> 00:56:33,692
All right, if this is what you want,
then I'm... I'm fine with it.

873
00:56:35,609 --> 00:56:38,026
do you see why
I'm marrying this guy?

874
00:56:38,776 --> 00:56:41,734
Because he is so good to me.

875
00:56:41,818 --> 00:56:45,651
Yep, you two will have no problem
planning the wedding while I'm gone.

876
00:56:45,734 --> 00:56:48,193
- I beg your pardon?
- Just for a week.

877
00:56:48,276 --> 00:56:50,194
- Gone?
- I've got to fly back east.

878
00:56:50,277 --> 00:56:53,319
We're looking at buying out
a few of our manufacturers.

879
00:56:53,403 --> 00:56:56,819
- Fran, this is a really critical time.
- That's why we shouldn't lose momentum.

880
00:56:56,902 --> 00:57:00,361
You guys will do a great job.
I trust you.

881
00:57:03,694 --> 00:57:06,112
Fran wants statues at the wedding.

882
00:57:06,195 --> 00:57:11,070
A well-chosen sculpture can help enhance
the tone and theme of the ceremony.

883
00:57:11,112 --> 00:57:13,070
Something like this could be nice.

884
00:57:13,153 --> 00:57:15,070
A little depressing, isn't it?

885
00:57:15,153 --> 00:57:17,945
No, it's wistful and romantic.

886
00:57:17,987 --> 00:57:19,363
Oh.

887
00:57:19,446 --> 00:57:20,862
Okay.

888
00:57:25,238 --> 00:57:28,821
I always pictured
a small wedding myself.

889
00:57:28,862 --> 00:57:31,363
Close friends and family.

890
00:57:31,446 --> 00:57:33,506
On the beach somewhere.
Cool, salty breeze.

891
00:57:36,739 --> 00:57:40,322
You know, the Aphrodite we passed
on the way in might be perfect.

892
00:57:40,406 --> 00:57:42,322
What about this guy?

893
00:57:42,406 --> 00:57:46,030
Well, this is all wrong for a wedding.
It's too menacing.

894
00:57:46,114 --> 00:57:48,657
Mary, I think you're wrong.

895
00:57:48,740 --> 00:57:51,657
He's not menacing.
He's masculine.

896
00:57:52,740 --> 00:57:54,490
He's the protector.

897
00:57:54,574 --> 00:57:56,615
- This man is strong.
- He's naked.

898
00:57:56,699 --> 00:57:57,990
This man is sturdy.

899
00:57:58,865 --> 00:58:00,740
Oh, my God.

900
00:58:00,824 --> 00:58:02,948
Pick him up
before somebody sees.

901
00:58:03,908 --> 00:58:05,324
You all right?

902
00:58:07,741 --> 00:58:10,700
- The man is heavy.
- Oh, my God, there's a guard coming.

903
00:58:12,449 --> 00:58:13,533
There.

904
00:58:14,491 --> 00:58:16,366
Oh, my God.

905
00:58:16,449 --> 00:58:18,324
You castrated him.

906
00:58:19,450 --> 00:58:21,117
Oh, no.

907
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:22,826
The guard's coming this way.

908
00:58:22,909 --> 00:58:25,868
- I'm sorry, buddy.
- We gotta fix him.

909
00:58:26,784 --> 00:58:29,701
What do you got?
Oh, of course. Krazy Glue.

910
00:58:29,784 --> 00:58:34,035
Why didn't I bring Krazy Glue,
in case his pecker fell off?

911
00:58:34,077 --> 00:58:37,119
- All right, ready?
- Is it sticking?

912
00:58:37,201 --> 00:58:40,451
- You got it?
- Yeah, he's on. Oh, shit.

913
00:58:40,535 --> 00:58:42,827
Steve's stuck.
Steve's glued to his pecker.

914
00:58:42,910 --> 00:58:44,368
- Hi.
- Hi there.

915
00:58:44,410 --> 00:58:46,785
Sir, touching the statues
isn't permitted.

916
00:58:46,869 --> 00:58:48,286
Yes, sir.

917
00:58:48,369 --> 00:58:50,286
You're right.
It's limestone, not granite.

918
00:58:50,369 --> 00:58:53,287
We had a bet going.
She won.

919
00:58:53,369 --> 00:58:54,619
- Sir.
- Yeah?

920
00:58:54,703 --> 00:58:55,953
Your hand, sir.

921
00:59:00,661 --> 00:59:02,494
Yeah, my hand.

922
00:59:03,579 --> 00:59:05,829
Here it is.
You were right.

923
00:59:06,579 --> 00:59:08,163
A limestone penis.

924
00:59:09,371 --> 00:59:11,413
You'd think he'd be bigger, huh?

925
00:59:14,371 --> 00:59:15,787
All right.

926
00:59:18,580 --> 00:59:19,496
Jesus.

927
00:59:20,705 --> 00:59:23,247
What else you got in that?

928
00:59:23,289 --> 00:59:24,872
My entire universe.

929
00:59:32,831 --> 00:59:34,248
- I'm sorry...
- I'm sorry...

930
00:59:34,331 --> 00:59:36,914
- I'm sorry. Go ahead.
- No, you go.

931
00:59:37,998 --> 00:59:40,248
I'm sorry about Napa.

932
00:59:41,831 --> 00:59:45,123
I didn't mean to call you
bitter and cynical. You're not.

933
00:59:45,206 --> 00:59:49,458
And I'm sorry, what I said about
your marriage being doomed to fail.

934
00:59:51,416 --> 00:59:54,332
Well, I apologize for saying
you were just an opportunity.

935
00:59:55,624 --> 00:59:57,585
That was pretty ugly of me.

936
00:59:57,626 --> 01:00:01,626
And I was only half serious
about the teal bridesmaid thing.

937
01:00:02,835 --> 01:00:05,752
Well, at least I have
a 50-50 chance, right?

938
01:00:07,377 --> 01:00:10,335
You and Fran are gonna be
real happy together.

939
01:00:11,461 --> 01:00:14,377
So are you and Massimo.
It's gonna work.

940
01:00:14,461 --> 01:00:18,295
Yeah, well, um,
we're not engaged anymore.

941
01:00:19,795 --> 01:00:22,086
- Really?
- Really.

942
01:00:23,545 --> 01:00:25,503
- Are you okay with that?
- Yeah.

943
01:00:27,378 --> 01:00:30,295
It was more my dad
trying to get us together.

944
01:00:31,962 --> 01:00:34,171
Why would he want to do that?

945
01:00:38,379 --> 01:00:41,337
Well, probably because
he was so happy with my mom.

946
01:00:56,756 --> 01:01:00,089
Fran said to go forward
with the violet chocolate...

947
01:01:00,173 --> 01:01:02,840
- The chocolate one?
- The one that you suggested.

948
01:01:02,923 --> 01:01:05,215
Good. Then I'll
put in that order today.

949
01:01:05,298 --> 01:01:07,506
- How is Fran?
- She's good.

950
01:01:07,590 --> 01:01:11,339
She's making deals, kickin' butt.
You know, being Fran.

951
01:01:15,339 --> 01:01:17,507
Oh, nicely done.

952
01:01:20,924 --> 01:01:23,382
- Thank you, Mary.
- You're welcome.

953
01:01:23,424 --> 01:01:25,050
You wanna keep it?

954
01:01:26,258 --> 01:01:27,716
Sure.

955
01:01:33,633 --> 01:01:36,092
Wow, it's a nice day.

956
01:01:37,301 --> 01:01:40,259
I agree with you
about the small wedding.

957
01:01:41,633 --> 01:01:44,051
That's the way I'd do it too.

958
01:01:52,885 --> 01:01:54,344
Papa.

959
01:02:00,427 --> 01:02:03,261
How nice to see you.

960
01:02:04,345 --> 01:02:05,595
Where's my father?

961
01:02:05,677 --> 01:02:09,553
He's out buying the balloons
for Burt's birthday party.

962
01:02:10,303 --> 01:02:11,927
Tell him I was here.

963
01:02:11,969 --> 01:02:13,595
Wait, Mary.

964
01:02:14,345 --> 01:02:15,678
Are you mad with me?

965
01:02:15,761 --> 01:02:17,304
Yes...

966
01:02:17,346 --> 01:02:19,095
I'm mad at you.

967
01:02:19,179 --> 01:02:21,554
You told my father
we were engaged.

968
01:02:21,637 --> 01:02:24,554
He tried to measure me
for a wedding dress.

969
01:02:24,637 --> 01:02:27,596
What is the matter with you?
You never listen.

970
01:02:27,679 --> 01:02:31,347
Massimo, we are not going to
be together like that. Okay?

971
01:02:31,430 --> 01:02:34,929
- And why are you in my father's house?
- I am sorry. I will leave you alone.

972
01:02:36,013 --> 01:02:39,971
From now on, I'll no longer bother you.
We will be just friends.

973
01:02:40,013 --> 01:02:42,971
Oh, you thinkwe can be friends
just like that?

974
01:02:43,013 --> 01:02:46,389
I want to apologize
for any madness I caused you.

975
01:02:46,473 --> 01:02:47,806
Is this a trick?

976
01:02:47,848 --> 01:02:49,806
No tricks.
I'm very serious.

977
01:02:50,848 --> 01:02:53,389
I just want for us to be
buddy-buddy.

978
01:02:54,848 --> 01:02:57,306
I promise you.

979
01:02:59,181 --> 01:03:01,599
do you have plans for dinner?

980
01:03:01,682 --> 01:03:05,474
As a friend, I want to
make for you a wonderful...

981
01:03:05,557 --> 01:03:07,474
American dish.

982
01:03:08,641 --> 01:03:10,307
Sit. I will start.

983
01:03:12,724 --> 01:03:15,265
That's your specialty?
Instant macaroni and cheese?

984
01:03:15,307 --> 01:03:17,725
It is a low-budget wonder.

985
01:03:17,808 --> 01:03:20,224
Already today,
I've eaten three boxes.

986
01:03:21,433 --> 01:03:24,017
Nothing like
a well-balanced diet.

987
01:03:37,310 --> 01:03:41,060
- You remind me so much of your mother.
- You don't remember my mother.

988
01:03:41,143 --> 01:03:43,185
Yeah, I remember your mother.

989
01:03:44,268 --> 01:03:46,435
She had the same big smile...

990
01:03:46,477 --> 01:03:48,644
and the same dark hair.

991
01:03:48,727 --> 01:03:52,644
She had no nail on her little finger.
I don't remember why.

992
01:03:54,685 --> 01:03:58,228
A brick fell on it when she was little.
It never grew back.

993
01:03:58,311 --> 01:04:00,479
You see?
We have much history together.

994
01:04:00,519 --> 01:04:02,479
I guess we sort ofdo.

995
01:04:08,561 --> 01:04:11,479
You look like
you have much on your mind.

996
01:04:11,562 --> 01:04:12,978
Not at all.

997
01:04:14,103 --> 01:04:15,729
Well, we're friends...

998
01:04:15,771 --> 01:04:19,188
and friends listen when friends
are not feeling so good...

999
01:04:19,271 --> 01:04:21,355
so please to tell me.

1000
01:04:25,063 --> 01:04:27,063
There's nothing to tell.

1001
01:04:27,146 --> 01:04:30,064
I thought I could control everything,
and I can't.

1002
01:04:31,189 --> 01:04:34,147
I met someone who I thought was...

1003
01:04:34,189 --> 01:04:35,689
Well, he's not.

1004
01:04:40,897 --> 01:04:44,064
did you ever like somebody,
but the timing was off?

1005
01:04:45,273 --> 01:04:46,524
Way off?

1006
01:04:47,940 --> 01:04:51,357
You feel things
you should not be feeling?

1007
01:04:54,273 --> 01:04:56,190
I'm not making any sense.

1008
01:04:58,273 --> 01:05:00,233
You make much sense.

1009
01:05:02,608 --> 01:05:05,982
You long for him
the way I long for you.

1010
01:05:09,693 --> 01:05:11,610
I don't want you to think...

1011
01:05:11,693 --> 01:05:13,610
I want to tell you something.

1012
01:05:15,528 --> 01:05:18,110
You need to learn patience.

1013
01:05:19,277 --> 01:05:21,236
Love can't always be perfect.

1014
01:05:21,277 --> 01:05:23,236
Love is just love.

1015
01:05:28,528 --> 01:05:30,487
My mom used to say that.

1016
01:05:30,529 --> 01:05:33,112
Your mother was a very wise woman.

1017
01:05:36,487 --> 01:05:37,821
Eat.

1018
01:05:49,239 --> 01:05:54,363
We'll start with camellias as a base,
and anything else that jumps out at you.

1019
01:05:55,446 --> 01:05:57,863
- Let me know.
- Okay.

1020
01:05:57,947 --> 01:05:59,697
Roses.

1021
01:05:59,781 --> 01:06:01,198
Wreaths.

1022
01:06:01,281 --> 01:06:03,365
We don't need any more statues.

1023
01:06:04,531 --> 01:06:05,823
How about this beauty?

1024
01:06:05,864 --> 01:06:07,989
Interesting.

1025
01:06:08,031 --> 01:06:10,614
This is called a bleeding heart...

1026
01:06:10,697 --> 01:06:13,489
the official funeral fower
of Tibet.

1027
01:06:13,531 --> 01:06:15,740
I knew I'd be good at this.

1028
01:06:16,865 --> 01:06:18,782
I'll take
some Slit-My-Wrists-Susans...

1029
01:06:18,865 --> 01:06:20,782
and we'll be ready.

1030
01:06:24,282 --> 01:06:26,199
How'd you guys meet?

1031
01:06:26,282 --> 01:06:28,366
- Me and Fran?
- Yeah.

1032
01:06:28,449 --> 01:06:29,908
College.

1033
01:06:29,991 --> 01:06:31,950
She was in one of your classes?

1034
01:06:31,991 --> 01:06:34,117
No, she was a bookie, actually.

1035
01:06:34,200 --> 01:06:36,658
- Fran was a bookie?
- Yeah, she was.

1036
01:06:36,741 --> 01:06:38,658
She single-handedly established...

1037
01:06:38,741 --> 01:06:41,075
this underground gambling ring
at UC Berkeley...

1038
01:06:41,158 --> 01:06:43,867
took bets on every sporting event
imaginable, ran numbers...

1039
01:06:43,951 --> 01:06:46,867
and even hosted a Vegas night
at her sorority house.

1040
01:06:46,951 --> 01:06:49,368
- You're lying.
- No, that was Fran.

1041
01:06:49,451 --> 01:06:52,410
- Orchids? Does that work?
- Yeah, orchids would work.

1042
01:06:52,451 --> 01:06:53,742
Okay.

1043
01:06:53,826 --> 01:06:55,742
Yeah, she was the coolest.

1044
01:06:55,826 --> 01:06:59,035
I was the bookworm, she was
the wild child, and she picked me.

1045
01:07:00,827 --> 01:07:03,285
- Thank you.
- Enjoy.

1046
01:07:04,619 --> 01:07:06,827
- How about cabbage?
- My God.

1047
01:07:08,452 --> 01:07:10,369
- What's the matter?
- Just hide me.

1048
01:07:10,452 --> 01:07:13,412
- Mary, what are you doing?
- Don't say my name!

1049
01:07:13,495 --> 01:07:14,994
Oh, my God.

1050
01:07:34,454 --> 01:07:35,621
You okay?

1051
01:07:35,705 --> 01:07:37,121
I found it.

1052
01:07:40,246 --> 01:07:42,621
Hi. How you doing?
I'm Steve Edison.

1053
01:07:42,663 --> 01:07:45,622
Keith Richmond.
My wife Wendy.

1054
01:07:45,664 --> 01:07:47,831
Nice to meet you, Wendy.

1055
01:07:49,205 --> 01:07:51,580
So, how do you all know each other?

1056
01:07:52,497 --> 01:07:55,664
- It's a long story.
- Oh, let me tell it.

1057
01:07:55,747 --> 01:07:57,664
It's really a funny story.

1058
01:07:57,748 --> 01:07:59,165
See, Keith...

1059
01:07:59,248 --> 01:08:00,915
was my fiance.

1060
01:08:00,999 --> 01:08:04,456
And Wendy was
his high school girlfriend.

1061
01:08:04,498 --> 01:08:07,915
On the night of our rehearsal dinner,
I found them making out.

1062
01:08:10,082 --> 01:08:12,289
In my car.

1063
01:08:13,291 --> 01:08:15,666
I think that covers
all the high points.

1064
01:08:15,708 --> 01:08:17,666
did I leave anything out?

1065
01:08:21,208 --> 01:08:23,125
- You all right?
- Yeah.

1066
01:08:26,375 --> 01:08:27,792
This home?

1067
01:08:30,084 --> 01:08:32,001
You wanna go up?

1068
01:08:43,377 --> 01:08:45,127
All right? You okay?

1069
01:08:45,168 --> 01:08:49,419
Jezebel was the only queen in the Bible
to be eaten by dogs.

1070
01:08:49,502 --> 01:08:52,502
- Did she fall down in the street?
- That's yours.

1071
01:08:54,085 --> 01:08:56,043
Hang on. Hang on.

1072
01:08:59,586 --> 01:09:03,169
- Mr. And Mrs. Wilfred Barber.
- No, it's not that one.

1073
01:09:04,919 --> 01:09:07,336
Nancy Pong.

1074
01:09:13,212 --> 01:09:14,753
Whoisit?

1075
01:09:14,795 --> 01:09:16,837
Nancy Pong? 2C?

1076
01:09:16,920 --> 01:09:19,713
- Yes.
- Nancy, would you buzz us in, please?

1077
01:09:20,462 --> 01:09:22,837
It's Mary Fiore, 7H.

1078
01:09:22,878 --> 01:09:24,754
Who?

1079
01:09:24,837 --> 01:09:26,087
You don't know me.

1080
01:09:27,171 --> 01:09:29,088
We haven't met because...

1081
01:09:30,255 --> 01:09:32,839
I'm a control freak...

1082
01:09:32,879 --> 01:09:35,338
and I don't have time for people.

1083
01:09:37,088 --> 01:09:40,005
But if you ever need
to borrow a cup of sugar...

1084
01:09:41,213 --> 01:09:43,131
I can't help you...

1085
01:09:45,339 --> 01:09:47,798
'cause I don't have time to shop.

1086
01:09:58,215 --> 01:10:00,173
I wanna go home.

1087
01:10:01,465 --> 01:10:03,132
We are home.

1088
01:10:03,215 --> 01:10:05,841
We're just out on the porch.

1089
01:10:05,883 --> 01:10:07,340
All right?

1090
01:10:09,173 --> 01:10:11,091
He's married...

1091
01:10:12,592 --> 01:10:14,884
and they're gonna have a baby.

1092
01:10:17,466 --> 01:10:19,383
And he looked good.

1093
01:10:20,466 --> 01:10:21,758
No, he didn't.

1094
01:10:21,843 --> 01:10:24,302
- No, he really didn't.
- He did.

1095
01:10:27,845 --> 01:10:31,137
Hold it there, please. Thank you.
Here we go. We're in.

1096
01:10:31,178 --> 01:10:34,636
- I don't know him.
- I know, but he'll hold the door for us.

1097
01:10:34,720 --> 01:10:37,803
Come here. Here we go.
Stand up.

1098
01:10:37,887 --> 01:10:39,803
Hold that position. Here we go.

1099
01:10:39,887 --> 01:10:43,346
We got your beer, we got your purse,
we got you, we got your keys.

1100
01:10:43,429 --> 01:10:45,721
Hi there.
Here we go.

1101
01:10:45,762 --> 01:10:48,721
This is somebody that lives
in the same building. Thank you.

1102
01:10:48,762 --> 01:10:50,929
Are you Nancy Pong?

1103
01:10:52,305 --> 01:10:54,430
Okay, a little bit more.

1104
01:10:56,805 --> 01:10:58,722
A little fire.

1105
01:11:05,347 --> 01:11:07,264
Medium well.

1106
01:11:08,555 --> 01:11:11,473
You really don't think
he looked good?

1107
01:11:11,557 --> 01:11:13,973
Oh, no.
He looked old.

1108
01:11:14,056 --> 01:11:15,890
You know?

1109
01:11:15,931 --> 01:11:18,973
Unhappy and fat.
He put on a couple pounds.

1110
01:11:19,056 --> 01:11:20,473
Be quiet.

1111
01:11:26,474 --> 01:11:28,932
He said they were just friends...

1112
01:11:30,308 --> 01:11:32,391
but deep down, I knew better.

1113
01:11:39,683 --> 01:11:41,601
I was just a stand-in.

1114
01:11:43,142 --> 01:11:45,225
A poor man's Wendy.

1115
01:11:49,933 --> 01:11:52,559
She threw my bridal shower for me.

1116
01:11:52,642 --> 01:11:56,893
She even took time to freeze mint leaves
and raspberries in ice cubes.

1117
01:11:56,934 --> 01:12:00,059
That should've tipped me off
right there.

1118
01:12:00,143 --> 01:12:02,059
She was trying too hard.

1119
01:12:06,852 --> 01:12:08,268
Jerk.

1120
01:12:12,269 --> 01:12:15,311
It's a good thing I didn't marry him.

1121
01:12:21,519 --> 01:12:23,936
But most of the time I think...

1122
01:12:28,021 --> 01:12:30,604
I just wasn't enough.

1123
01:12:36,104 --> 01:12:38,520
No, no, no, you're wrong.

1124
01:12:44,772 --> 01:12:46,688
And another thing.

1125
01:12:49,313 --> 01:12:50,730
This Wendy...

1126
01:12:52,855 --> 01:12:56,065
she's nothing but a poor man's Mary.

1127
01:13:25,816 --> 01:13:27,233
It's getting late.

1128
01:13:32,858 --> 01:13:34,608
I'd better go.

1129
01:13:40,026 --> 01:13:41,984
I'll walk you to the door.

1130
01:13:42,026 --> 01:13:44,984
- That's all right. Stay there.
- No, it's okay.

1131
01:13:47,318 --> 01:13:49,734
- Wait.
- Take your time. You all right?

1132
01:13:56,235 --> 01:13:59,152
Thanks for tonight.
I know that I was a mess.

1133
01:13:59,235 --> 01:14:02,444
No, you weren't a mess.

1134
01:14:03,611 --> 01:14:05,069
A little bit.

1135
01:14:07,027 --> 01:14:08,110
Shut up.

1136
01:14:08,194 --> 01:14:10,779
- You gonna be okay?
- Yeah.

1137
01:14:10,861 --> 01:14:14,820
Two aspirin, a lot of water,
sleep, and a beer in the morning.

1138
01:14:14,862 --> 01:14:16,986
That's the cure.

1139
01:14:17,070 --> 01:14:19,236
- Good night, Mary.
- Good night.

1140
01:14:54,365 --> 01:14:56,531
You ever think about
that night in the park?

1141
01:14:56,615 --> 01:14:57,823
What?

1142
01:15:02,448 --> 01:15:04,406
I barely know you.

1143
01:15:05,740 --> 01:15:08,491
I don't know your dad's first name.

1144
01:15:08,574 --> 01:15:13,158
I don't know if you ever wore braces
or contacts or glasses.

1145
01:15:13,241 --> 01:15:16,158
I have no idea how you came to be
a wedding planner, Mary.

1146
01:15:22,075 --> 01:15:24,242
But I know
the curves of your face...

1147
01:15:27,368 --> 01:15:30,326
and I know every feck of gold
in your eyes.

1148
01:15:35,577 --> 01:15:37,869
And I know that
that night in the park...

1149
01:15:41,329 --> 01:15:43,912
was the best time I've ever had.

1150
01:15:58,205 --> 01:15:59,913
Please say something.

1151
01:16:01,955 --> 01:16:04,538
I'm a magnet for unavailable men...

1152
01:16:08,122 --> 01:16:10,081
and I'm sick of it.

1153
01:16:14,581 --> 01:16:15,997
It's simple.

1154
01:16:18,331 --> 01:16:19,789
I know Fran.

1155
01:16:21,498 --> 01:16:22,957
I respect her.

1156
01:16:25,457 --> 01:16:26,915
And she loves you.

1157
01:16:31,666 --> 01:16:34,249
So, besides your tux measurements...

1158
01:16:36,249 --> 01:16:38,208
that's all I need to know.

1159
01:16:45,333 --> 01:16:47,041
Please go away.

1160
01:16:54,292 --> 01:16:56,084
Good night, Mary.

1161
01:17:17,794 --> 01:17:19,752
How do you word an invitation...

1162
01:17:19,794 --> 01:17:22,253
where both sets ofparents
are paying for the wedding...

1163
01:17:22,294 --> 01:17:25,253
the groom is in the military,
about to receive a medical degree...

1164
01:17:25,294 --> 01:17:28,920
and the bride is a widow whose father
recently had a sex-change operation...

1165
01:17:29,003 --> 01:17:32,461
and now goes by the name
Sugar Pie de Santo?

1166
01:17:32,545 --> 01:17:34,503
- Mary?
- What is it?

1167
01:17:34,545 --> 01:17:36,503
A little tense?

1168
01:17:36,545 --> 01:17:39,504
Just terribly, terribly...

1169
01:17:39,587 --> 01:17:40,671
alert.

1170
01:17:45,379 --> 01:17:46,587
What's the matter?

1171
01:17:46,671 --> 01:17:48,712
I came back early.

1172
01:17:50,712 --> 01:17:53,630
Why?
I mean, is everything okay?

1173
01:17:53,713 --> 01:17:55,880
I've discovered something.

1174
01:17:57,547 --> 01:18:00,964
I've been blind.
I didn't want to see it.

1175
01:18:01,839 --> 01:18:04,422
I tried to ignore the signs.

1176
01:18:05,547 --> 01:18:07,631
I think you know
what I'm talking about.

1177
01:18:07,673 --> 01:18:11,382
Let me explain.
It's not what you think.

1178
01:18:11,465 --> 01:18:12,923
Yes, it is.

1179
01:18:14,673 --> 01:18:16,714
I can't go through with this wedding.

1180
01:18:18,465 --> 01:18:20,006
But, Fran...

1181
01:18:20,048 --> 01:18:23,424
I was in a meeting
talking about Boccolino mozzarella...

1182
01:18:23,508 --> 01:18:26,425
and it hit me
that this isn't going to work.

1183
01:18:27,799 --> 01:18:30,924
I can't stand the way
he chews on pen caps...

1184
01:18:31,007 --> 01:18:33,966
or the songs
that he sings in the shower.

1185
01:18:34,007 --> 01:18:39,634
It drives me nuts, how he hikes up his
left pant leg after he's eaten too much.

1186
01:18:41,008 --> 01:18:45,092
Is Eddie gonna be the last man
that I sleep with...

1187
01:18:45,175 --> 01:18:46,592
ever?

1188
01:18:48,551 --> 01:18:53,009
I've been with him so long, I don't
even know why we're together anymore.

1189
01:19:00,926 --> 01:19:02,218
Look at me.

1190
01:19:05,301 --> 01:19:07,219
You are exquisite.

1191
01:19:09,886 --> 01:19:11,052
You're timeless.

1192
01:19:13,219 --> 01:19:16,177
And you have the love
of a man named Steve.

1193
01:19:18,177 --> 01:19:23,637
A man who, while you were away having
meetings about mozzarella, said to me...

1194
01:19:23,721 --> 01:19:26,637
"I can't believe she picked me.

1195
01:19:29,303 --> 01:19:33,262
I can't believe I'm marrying the most
incredible woman I've ever met."

1196
01:19:39,638 --> 01:19:42,596
So that tells me
that this marriage of yours...

1197
01:19:44,013 --> 01:19:45,972
is not only gonna work...

1198
01:19:48,596 --> 01:19:50,723
it's gonna last forever.

1199
01:19:53,305 --> 01:19:54,431
Really?

1200
01:19:57,181 --> 01:19:58,389
Really.

1201
01:20:02,140 --> 01:20:03,597
Thank you.

1202
01:20:07,432 --> 01:20:09,391
Thank you, thank you.

1203
01:20:12,974 --> 01:20:13,099
For he's a jolly good fellow

1204
01:20:13,099 --> 01:20:15,266
For he's a jolly good fellow

1205
01:20:15,349 --> 01:20:18,182
For he's a jolly good fellow

1206
01:20:18,266 --> 01:20:20,808
Which nobody can deny

1207
01:20:22,516 --> 01:20:25,434
Let me pray, let me pray.

1208
01:20:33,808 --> 01:20:36,767
Hope he didn't spit on the cake.

1209
01:20:36,809 --> 01:20:38,892
Come on.
Open up your presents.

1210
01:20:40,560 --> 01:20:44,059
No, no, please.
Everyone, I want to make some toast.

1211
01:20:46,518 --> 01:20:49,270
- Happy birthday, Burt.
- Salute.

1212
01:20:50,937 --> 01:20:53,354
Buddy Burt.
Salvatore.

1213
01:20:53,438 --> 01:20:57,479
I want to thank Salvatore
for taking me into his life...

1214
01:20:57,563 --> 01:21:00,812
and introducing me
to all you wonderful people.

1215
01:21:05,063 --> 01:21:06,980
Hold on a moment.

1216
01:21:08,896 --> 01:21:10,814
Where is he going?

1217
01:21:42,566 --> 01:21:47,190
I know I never done the right thing,
I never say the right thing...

1218
01:21:47,274 --> 01:21:49,357
and I act like a fool.

1219
01:21:52,609 --> 01:21:56,191
I know I say
we're just buddy-buddy friends...

1220
01:21:56,275 --> 01:21:59,233
but that would not be true
to my heart.

1221
01:22:00,901 --> 01:22:03,525
So I would ask you
this one question.

1222
01:22:03,609 --> 01:22:05,526
And if you answer no...

1223
01:22:07,568 --> 01:22:10,526
then I will leave you alone
once and for all.

1224
01:22:15,610 --> 01:22:18,152
Be my wife, Mary Fiore...

1225
01:22:19,903 --> 01:22:25,320
and I will take care of you
and be true to you...

1226
01:22:25,361 --> 01:22:29,028
and, like this house
I built for your dolls...

1227
01:22:29,111 --> 01:22:33,236
I will make sure you have
a strong roof over your head.

1228
01:22:33,320 --> 01:22:36,196
If your answer is yes...

1229
01:22:36,237 --> 01:22:39,820
then no one will ever love you
as much as I love you.

1230
01:22:41,570 --> 01:22:43,528
If your answer is yes...

1231
01:22:45,487 --> 01:22:48,945
you will make me
the happiest man on the Earth.

1232
01:25:36,667 --> 01:25:38,626
What would I have done
without you?

1233
01:25:38,667 --> 01:25:41,459
Hey, wedding woman,
you did some job.

1234
01:25:41,542 --> 01:25:44,833
My girl's gonna knock 'em dead.
Aren't you, sluggo?

1235
01:25:44,917 --> 01:25:48,834
Well, somebody stole my lucky mike.
I can't sing without my lucky mike.

1236
01:26:27,714 --> 01:26:29,297
What are you doing here?

1237
01:26:29,381 --> 01:26:32,507
You know it's bad luck
to see the bride before the wedding.

1238
01:26:35,757 --> 01:26:37,007
You look beautiful.

1239
01:26:37,840 --> 01:26:41,423
Go on. Get out of here.
We're starting any minute.

1240
01:26:41,507 --> 01:26:42,924
Come on.

1241
01:26:44,298 --> 01:26:47,383
- Let's take a walk.
- A walk?

1242
01:26:47,466 --> 01:26:49,841
A walk. Come on.

1243
01:26:49,925 --> 01:26:51,341
Come on.

1244
01:26:53,591 --> 01:26:56,175
No. What are you talking about?
You cannot give the whole wedding to me.

1245
01:26:56,258 --> 01:26:59,050
Everything is gonna be fine.
It's a no-brainer.

1246
01:26:59,133 --> 01:27:01,008
You can't do this.
Geri's out there!

1247
01:27:01,050 --> 01:27:04,051
So?
The whole commission is yours.

1248
01:27:05,759 --> 01:27:07,343
That's more money
than I make in a year.

1249
01:27:07,425 --> 01:27:11,301
Then I guess that means we're gonna
have to go shopping next week.

1250
01:27:13,259 --> 01:27:16,259
I am completely confused.
Why are you doing this?

1251
01:27:17,802 --> 01:27:18,885
Because there's somewhere
I've gotta be.

1252
01:27:19,969 --> 01:27:22,843
Okay, we can talk
afterthe wedding.

1253
01:27:22,927 --> 01:27:24,927
Hang on a minute, Fran.

1254
01:27:27,344 --> 01:27:31,428
- Why do you wanna marry me?
- What?

1255
01:27:31,512 --> 01:27:33,678
That's one of the questions
I need answered.

1256
01:27:35,220 --> 01:27:36,886
Steve, you're scaring me.

1257
01:27:38,053 --> 01:27:39,512
You never call me Steve.

1258
01:27:40,262 --> 01:27:41,761
That's because you don't like it.

1259
01:27:44,136 --> 01:27:46,096
I never said I didn't like it.

1260
01:27:48,638 --> 01:27:51,680
- Okay, where is this going?
- Why do you wanna marry me?

1261
01:27:53,971 --> 01:27:55,971
Are you kidding me?

1262
01:27:56,012 --> 01:27:57,971
- Are you kidding me?
- No, I'm not.

1263
01:27:58,012 --> 01:28:01,639
You're trying to dump me
on the day of my wedding.

1264
01:28:01,681 --> 01:28:04,930
- I just need to know your answer.
- This is not happening to me.

1265
01:28:05,013 --> 01:28:07,514
- Franny, Franny.
- This is... don't "Franny" me!

1266
01:28:07,597 --> 01:28:10,180
don't "Franny" me,
you selfish bastard!

1267
01:28:10,264 --> 01:28:13,055
The reasons we were together in college
don't hold up anymore.

1268
01:28:13,138 --> 01:28:15,097
We're different people now.

1269
01:28:15,138 --> 01:28:17,682
- And?
- And I think you know that.

1270
01:28:19,014 --> 01:28:20,931
Listen to me.

1271
01:28:21,014 --> 01:28:24,014
If you really love me,
I'll put this cummerbund on right now...

1272
01:28:24,098 --> 01:28:27,473
we'll walk up that hill
and go to the big tent and do it.

1273
01:28:27,515 --> 01:28:30,223
- You would do that?
- Yes, I would.

1274
01:28:32,849 --> 01:28:34,683
All those people.

1275
01:28:34,766 --> 01:28:37,307
You don't know half of'em.

1276
01:28:38,891 --> 01:28:40,808
You and me.

1277
01:28:42,558 --> 01:28:43,975
Are you ready?

1278
01:28:47,225 --> 01:28:50,141
Yes. Yes, of course.

1279
01:28:53,600 --> 01:28:55,809
I just need a second.

1280
01:29:03,560 --> 01:29:04,977
Oh, God.

1281
01:29:27,270 --> 01:29:30,187
I don't want to get married.

1282
01:30:21,982 --> 01:30:24,898
How did we let it get this far?

1283
01:30:26,399 --> 01:30:27,898
I don't know.

1284
01:30:29,149 --> 01:30:31,233
What are we gonna do?

1285
01:30:33,233 --> 01:30:36,233
Well, that's the beauty of it.

1286
01:30:36,316 --> 01:30:38,275
Whatever we want.

1287
01:30:41,442 --> 01:30:45,609
I haven't thought about
what I really want in so long.

1288
01:30:45,693 --> 01:30:47,109
Me neither.

1289
01:30:55,860 --> 01:30:58,359
There you go.

1290
01:31:04,069 --> 01:31:05,152
Okay.

1291
01:31:06,777 --> 01:31:08,944
Okay.

1292
01:31:19,697 --> 01:31:22,947
That is the bride.
Is that the bride?

1293
01:31:23,030 --> 01:31:24,822
Yes, it is.

1294
01:31:24,864 --> 01:31:27,280
Well, is she coming back?

1295
01:31:31,157 --> 01:31:34,906
I think all the blood is rushing
to my head and I'm gonna faint.

1296
01:31:34,948 --> 01:31:37,448
I'm gonna kill Mary
for leaving me all alone here.

1297
01:31:37,489 --> 01:31:39,489
- I don't know what to do.
- Penny, take a breath.

1298
01:31:39,573 --> 01:31:41,656
What are you talking about?

1299
01:31:41,740 --> 01:31:44,824
I'm talking about your wedding planner
leaving me here all alone...

1300
01:31:44,907 --> 01:31:47,074
to go to city hall
and get married.

1301
01:31:47,158 --> 01:31:49,074
Married?

1302
01:31:49,158 --> 01:31:51,824
- What? Mary's getting married?
- Yeah, married.

1303
01:31:51,907 --> 01:31:54,366
- You know, married?
- No, she can't get married.

1304
01:31:54,408 --> 01:31:56,366
- Married.
- Hey, hey, city hall.

1305
01:31:56,408 --> 01:31:59,867
Married, you know, like what
you're supposed to be doing.

1306
01:31:59,908 --> 01:32:02,658
Oh, that's... Yeah.

1307
01:32:02,742 --> 01:32:07,034
That's great. Go. I'll tell everyone.
I'll tell Kathie Lee Gifford.

1308
01:32:12,992 --> 01:32:15,201
Beautiful.

1309
01:32:15,285 --> 01:32:16,826
Thanks.

1310
01:32:50,620 --> 01:32:52,746
Come on! Goddamn it.

1311
01:32:52,829 --> 01:32:55,245
Are you sure you
don't know a shortcut?

1312
01:32:55,329 --> 01:32:57,579
Take a shortcut somewhere?

1313
01:32:57,662 --> 01:32:59,580
- What do you expect me...
- Bullshit.

1314
01:32:59,663 --> 01:33:01,872
What are you doing?

1315
01:33:03,663 --> 01:33:06,371
Hold on the right. Hold!

1316
01:33:16,623 --> 01:33:19,873
We are gathered together
in the presence of these witnesses...

1317
01:33:19,956 --> 01:33:23,372
tojoin this man and this woman...

1318
01:33:23,456 --> 01:33:25,456
in matrimony.

1319
01:33:25,497 --> 01:33:28,290
This contract is not
to be taken lightly...

1320
01:33:28,332 --> 01:33:32,082
but thought fully and seriously...

1321
01:33:32,165 --> 01:33:34,540
with a deep realization...

1322
01:33:34,582 --> 01:33:39,082
of its obligations
and responsibilities.

1323
01:33:39,166 --> 01:33:41,124
If anyone can show just cause...

1324
01:33:41,206 --> 01:33:45,374
why these two should not
be joined together in matrimony...

1325
01:33:45,416 --> 01:33:47,958
then let him speak now
or forever...

1326
01:33:48,042 --> 01:33:49,958
hold his peace.

1327
01:33:55,333 --> 01:33:57,459
Fine.

1328
01:33:57,542 --> 01:34:00,168
- Then let us proceed.
- No.

1329
01:34:01,168 --> 01:34:03,792
- Thank God.
- Oh, hell, I object too.

1330
01:34:03,834 --> 01:34:05,168
What is going on here?

1331
01:34:07,542 --> 01:34:08,626
Here we go.

1332
01:34:13,002 --> 01:34:16,919
Maria, I look in your eyes
and it hurts my insides.

1333
01:34:17,002 --> 01:34:20,835
This is not what you want.
This is what I want.

1334
01:34:20,919 --> 01:34:22,585
Shame on me.

1335
01:34:22,627 --> 01:34:24,668
I'm so lucky
to have a father like you.

1336
01:34:26,668 --> 01:34:27,961
But you're right.

1337
01:34:29,420 --> 01:34:32,003
Love isn't like
some enchanted evening...

1338
01:34:33,337 --> 01:34:34,961
isn't a fairy tale...

1339
01:34:35,003 --> 01:34:37,503
or even love at first sight.

1340
01:34:38,836 --> 01:34:41,170
That isn't real life.

1341
01:34:44,213 --> 01:34:46,213
Massimo's a good man.

1342
01:34:46,254 --> 01:34:48,046
don't worry, Papa.

1343
01:34:48,129 --> 01:34:50,879
I know what I'm doing.

1344
01:34:52,754 --> 01:34:54,795
I'm just all grown up now.

1345
01:35:01,380 --> 01:35:03,339
Okay.

1346
01:35:08,672 --> 01:35:10,464
Hey, that's the doc!

1347
01:35:10,506 --> 01:35:12,798
- Steve!
- Oh, yes.

1348
01:35:12,881 --> 01:35:15,048
- You know the doctor?
- Mary. Where's Mary?

1349
01:35:15,131 --> 01:35:17,048
I'm her father.
Who the hell are you?

1350
01:35:17,131 --> 01:35:19,298
- He's the doctor.
- I'm Steve, the doctor.

1351
01:35:19,381 --> 01:35:21,798
- I'm in love with your daughter.
- You are the one?

1352
01:35:21,882 --> 01:35:24,632
- What the hell is going on?
- I'm sorry, but I am.

1353
01:35:24,715 --> 01:35:27,341
- What about Fran?
- Fran and I did not get married.

1354
01:35:27,424 --> 01:35:29,341
That's been happening a lot today.

1355
01:35:29,424 --> 01:35:31,090
Whoa. You didn't get married?

1356
01:35:31,132 --> 01:35:34,716
We're not married. I am not the one.
You are the one, Steve.

1357
01:35:34,799 --> 01:35:37,132
And you didn't get married?
She's not married?

1358
01:35:37,216 --> 01:35:40,758
She does not love me.
She loves you, Steve.

1359
01:35:42,342 --> 01:35:46,509
I could never forgive myself ifever
I got in the way of Mary's true love.

1360
01:35:46,550 --> 01:35:48,884
- Who the hell are you?
- I'm Steve.

1361
01:35:48,967 --> 01:35:50,300
He's Steve. He's the one.

1362
01:35:50,383 --> 01:35:52,342
I'm the doctor.
I'm in love with Mary.

1363
01:35:52,383 --> 01:35:54,342
Wait a minute!
Hold the phone.

1364
01:35:54,425 --> 01:35:58,093
You mean to tell me,
you love her and she loves you...

1365
01:35:58,176 --> 01:36:00,177
and neither of you
got married today?

1366
01:36:00,259 --> 01:36:01,927
That's what I'm saying.

1367
01:36:01,968 --> 01:36:05,010
Then what the hell are you
standing around talking to us for?

1368
01:36:05,093 --> 01:36:08,301
I don't know. Where is she?
Where is Mary? Somebody take me to Mary.

1369
01:36:08,343 --> 01:36:09,843
I take you. Come on.

1370
01:36:09,927 --> 01:36:12,094
- I like him.
- He's a doctor.

1371
01:36:22,761 --> 01:36:24,803
Congratulations!

1372
01:36:24,886 --> 01:36:26,223
Fabulous!

1373
01:36:26,306 --> 01:36:28,264
Good for you!

1374
01:36:30,098 --> 01:36:33,430
- Congratulations!
- Go, go. Thank you.

1375
01:36:56,183 --> 01:36:58,100
Thank you, Massimo!

1376
01:36:58,183 --> 01:37:00,308
You better be good to her!

1377
01:37:00,391 --> 01:37:03,183
I still do more chin-ups than you!

1378
01:37:31,102 --> 01:37:34,060
Why are you only eating
the brown ones?

1379
01:37:43,228 --> 01:37:46,144
Because someone once said that...

1380
01:37:46,228 --> 01:37:50,186
they had less artificial coloring
because chocolate's already brown.

1381
01:37:55,646 --> 01:37:57,729
And it kind of stayed with me.

1382
01:38:03,729 --> 01:38:05,562
You kind of stayed with me.

1383
01:38:14,980 --> 01:38:16,438
Where's Fran?

1384
01:38:17,480 --> 01:38:20,230
She's in Tahiti...

1385
01:38:20,313 --> 01:38:22,230
on our honeymoon.

1386
01:38:25,148 --> 01:38:26,773
We didn't get married.

1387
01:38:31,606 --> 01:38:32,690
Because?

1388
01:38:35,232 --> 01:38:38,481
Because she needs to
find her own life.

1389
01:38:44,358 --> 01:38:46,233
And I...

1390
01:38:48,983 --> 01:38:50,400
You what?

1391
01:38:53,649 --> 01:38:55,234
What does Steve want?

1392
01:38:56,359 --> 01:38:57,984
I want to dance...

1393
01:39:01,984 --> 01:39:03,858
with you.

1
00:01:49,134 --> 00:01:52,179
And so shall be saved
from mine enemies!

2
00:01:53,263 --> 00:01:57,309
The waves of death
have closed about me!

3
00:01:58,185 --> 00:02:01,814
The cords of hell
have encompassed me about

4
00:02:02,815 --> 00:02:06,402
and the snares of death
have overtaken me!

5
00:02:07,111 --> 00:02:10,197
The cords of hell
have encompassed me about

6
00:02:10,697 --> 00:02:15,327
and the snares of death
have overtaken me!

7
00:02:15,452 --> 00:02:21,834
In my tribulation I call to the Lord
and cry to my God

8
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:26,046
and He heard my voice
cry out His temple...!

9
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:28,590
Move back! Clear the way!

10
00:02:28,924 --> 00:02:30,968
Move back!

11
00:02:33,345 --> 00:02:35,389
Keep in line, woman!

12
00:02:41,687 --> 00:02:46,859
By order of their gracious Majesties,
Queen Mary and King Philip,

13
00:02:46,942 --> 00:02:51,864
we are come to witness the burning
of these Protestant heretics

14
00:02:51,947 --> 00:02:57,161
who have denied the authority
of the one true Catholic church

15
00:02:57,244 --> 00:03:00,122
and of His Holiness the Pope.

16
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:06,420
Let them burn for all eternity
in the flames of hell.

17
00:03:11,258 --> 00:03:17,347
Benedicat te Omnipotens Deus Pater,
Filius et Spiritus Sanctus.

18
00:03:17,848 --> 00:03:23,228
Benedicat te Omnipotens Deus Pater,
Filius et Spiritus Sanctus.

19
00:03:24,521 --> 00:03:29,943
Benedicat te Omnipotens Deus Pater,
Filius et Spiritus Sanctus.

20
00:03:30,027 --> 00:03:32,154
God bless you, Master Ridley!

21
00:03:32,237 --> 00:03:36,158
For the love of God, friends, help me!
I burn too slowly!

22
00:03:37,868 --> 00:03:41,622
Help them!
For God's sake, help them!

23
00:04:44,852 --> 00:04:47,646
Your Grace, the Queen is with child.

24
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:52,526
They should've consulted me
before they rang the bells.

25
00:04:56,238 --> 00:04:58,282
Is it true?

26
00:04:58,365 --> 00:05:03,829
She has ceased to bleed, her breasts have
some milk, and her stomach is swollen.

27
00:05:03,912 --> 00:05:05,247
Is it true?

28
00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:09,793
The King has not shared her bed
for many months.

29
00:05:09,877 --> 00:05:13,964
He has a repugnance for it,
as lately Your Grace has for mine.

30
00:05:34,276 --> 00:05:35,903
Norfolk...

31
00:05:36,904 --> 00:05:40,199
Your Majesties,
this is most wondrous news.

32
00:05:40,282 --> 00:05:41,784
Indeed.

33
00:05:41,867 --> 00:05:46,455
We do thank God for this,
our most happy condition.

34
00:05:46,538 --> 00:05:49,083
We must also thank His Majesty
for this event

35
00:05:49,166 --> 00:05:51,668
which is nothing short of a miracle.

36
00:05:55,172 --> 00:05:59,635
What news, my Lords,
of the rebellion against our authority?

37
00:06:00,719 --> 00:06:02,346
Sussex?

38
00:06:02,429 --> 00:06:05,849
Madam, it is safely dispatched,
thanks to His Grace.

39
00:06:05,933 --> 00:06:09,853
Sir Thomas Wyatt and the other leaders
are already dealt with.

40
00:06:09,937 --> 00:06:14,024
If they had succeeded,
these Protestants and heretics

41
00:06:14,108 --> 00:06:16,193
meant to place your sister

42
00:06:16,276 --> 00:06:18,404
upon the throne.

43
00:06:19,905 --> 00:06:23,409
There is no proof
against the Lady Elizabeth.

44
00:06:23,492 --> 00:06:27,037
- She is plainly guilty.
- What need is there of proof?

45
00:06:27,121 --> 00:06:30,207
If she remains alive,
there will be plots to raise her

46
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:32,000
to the throne.

47
00:06:32,084 --> 00:06:33,085
Ambassador?

48
00:06:37,381 --> 00:06:39,425
I agree with His Grace.

49
00:06:39,508 --> 00:06:43,762
She is a heretic.
She must never be allowed to succeed.

50
00:06:43,846 --> 00:06:45,180
But if she...

51
00:06:46,265 --> 00:06:49,226
If she were brought properly to trial,

52
00:06:49,309 --> 00:06:51,937
she would not be found guilty,

53
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:54,898
and we would be condemned.
She has friends in Parliament.

54
00:06:54,982 --> 00:06:58,652
My sister was born
of that whore Anne Boleyn!

55
00:06:58,736 --> 00:07:02,656
She was born a bastard!
She will never rule England!

56
00:07:10,372 --> 00:07:15,669
Your Grace will find some proof
of her treachery. I am most sure of it.

57
00:07:57,044 --> 00:07:58,670
It was so fast!

58
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:15,562
May I join you, my Lady?

59
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:26,824
If it please you, sir.

60
00:09:43,817 --> 00:09:45,235
My Lady!

61
00:09:45,319 --> 00:09:46,737
My Lady!

62
00:09:57,164 --> 00:09:58,791
Princess Elizabeth!

63
00:10:13,389 --> 00:10:15,432
Princess Elizabeth!

64
00:10:22,439 --> 00:10:25,818
You are accused of conspiring
with Sir Thomas Wyatt and others

65
00:10:25,901 --> 00:10:28,570
against Her Sovereign Majesty

66
00:10:28,654 --> 00:10:31,323
and are arrested for treason.

67
00:10:31,407 --> 00:10:36,995
I am commanded to take you hence
from this place... to the Tower.

68
00:10:50,467 --> 00:10:52,511
Remember who you are.

69
00:11:01,437 --> 00:11:03,480
Do not be afraid of them.

70
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:09,903
My Lady.

71
00:11:49,943 --> 00:11:51,987
Prisoner to the steps.

72
00:11:59,912 --> 00:12:03,665
I cannot confess to something
I did not do.

73
00:12:03,749 --> 00:12:05,167
Your denials are in vain.

74
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:09,588
You knew of the rebellion, Madam.
It is plain enough.

75
00:12:09,671 --> 00:12:11,423
Where is your proof?

76
00:12:11,507 --> 00:12:13,634
It was to your advantage.

77
00:12:13,717 --> 00:12:15,761
You must let me see the Queen...

78
00:12:15,844 --> 00:12:19,098
You despise the Queen,
and the Catholic faith.

79
00:12:26,772 --> 00:12:30,609
I am a true and faithful subject.

80
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:33,487
I attend Mass...

81
00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:36,115
You pretend! But in your heart...

82
00:12:38,242 --> 00:12:42,037
What's that? What say you, Madam?

83
00:12:42,121 --> 00:12:43,831
Speak up!

84
00:12:43,914 --> 00:12:48,210
Madam, if there is some small truth
in these charges,

85
00:12:48,293 --> 00:12:51,922
however innocently or unknowingly
you did proceed,

86
00:12:52,005 --> 00:12:54,049
you had best confess.

87
00:12:54,133 --> 00:12:55,884
I ask you

88
00:12:55,968 --> 00:13:00,806
why we must tear ourselves apart
for this small question of religion.

89
00:13:00,889 --> 00:13:02,975
Catholic, Protestant...!

90
00:13:03,058 --> 00:13:07,020
You think it small,
though it killed your mother!

91
00:13:17,114 --> 00:13:18,741
We all...

92
00:13:20,909 --> 00:13:23,579
We all believe in God, my Lords.

93
00:13:23,662 --> 00:13:27,624
No, Madam,
there is only one true belief.

94
00:13:27,708 --> 00:13:29,877
The other-heresy.

95
00:13:58,781 --> 00:14:00,824
Madam, you are cold.

96
00:14:00,908 --> 00:14:03,452
I do not need your pity.

97
00:14:03,744 --> 00:14:05,746
Accept it, then,

98
00:14:05,829 --> 00:14:07,414
for my sake.

99
00:14:10,834 --> 00:14:12,669
Thank you.

100
00:14:13,796 --> 00:14:16,465
I shall not forget this kindness.

101
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:30,622
Tonight I think I die.

102
00:15:37,796 --> 00:15:39,840
Madam.

103
00:15:42,593 --> 00:15:44,344
No...!

104
00:15:57,024 --> 00:15:59,318
Save me! Save me!

105
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:37,147
I am Your Majesty's most humble servant.

106
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,957
Come here.

107
00:16:56,166 --> 00:16:58,836
Closer, so I might see your face.

108
00:17:06,719 --> 00:17:10,222
When I look at you
I see nothing of the King.

109
00:17:10,305 --> 00:17:13,225
Only that whore-your mother.

110
00:17:15,269 --> 00:17:20,482
My father never did anything so well
as to cut off her head.

111
00:17:20,566 --> 00:17:23,694
Your Majesty forgets
he was also my father.

112
00:17:27,072 --> 00:17:30,909
Why will you not confess
your crimes against me?

113
00:17:30,993 --> 00:17:34,246
Because, Your Majesty,
I have committed none.

114
00:17:36,749 --> 00:17:39,418
You speak with such sincerity!

115
00:17:39,835 --> 00:17:43,380
I see you are still a consummate actress.

116
00:17:45,799 --> 00:17:48,093
My husband is gone.

117
00:17:48,177 --> 00:17:50,846
They have poisoned my child.

118
00:17:52,264 --> 00:17:54,725
They say it is a tumour.

119
00:17:56,435 --> 00:17:58,479
Madam, you are not well.

120
00:17:58,562 --> 00:18:02,691
They say this cancer
will make you Queen, but they are wrong!

121
00:18:02,775 --> 00:18:07,237
Look there! It is your death warrant.
All I need do is sign it.

122
00:18:07,321 --> 00:18:12,785
Mary, if you sign that paper,
you will be murdering your own sister.

123
00:18:18,499 --> 00:18:21,168
You will promise me something?

124
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:27,800
When I am gone, you will
do everything in your power

125
00:18:27,883 --> 00:18:30,219
to uphold the Catholic faith.

126
00:18:30,302 --> 00:18:36,517
Do not take away from the people
the consolations of the Blessed Virgin.

127
00:18:39,770 --> 00:18:41,814
When I am Queen

128
00:18:42,356 --> 00:18:44,400
I promise

129
00:18:47,111 --> 00:18:49,988
to act as my conscience dictates.

130
00:18:52,574 --> 00:18:54,910
Well, do not think to be Queen at all.

131
00:18:54,993 --> 00:18:58,330
You may return to your house at Hatfield,

132
00:18:58,414 --> 00:19:01,834
but you will remain under arrest
until I am recovered.

133
00:19:03,669 --> 00:19:05,713
Thank you, Your Majesty.

134
00:19:05,796 --> 00:19:07,214
No...

135
00:19:07,297 --> 00:19:12,386
Feed her to the wolves.
Let her see what they are like.

136
00:19:58,974 --> 00:20:03,103
She is just a child,
and yet still you piss yourselves!

137
00:20:06,523 --> 00:20:09,651
Your Grace,
Protestants are returning from abroad.

138
00:20:09,735 --> 00:20:14,907
Yes, and have made plans to massacre
every Catholic in England.

139
00:20:15,324 --> 00:20:19,578
There would be butchery indeed
if such a plan were even conceivable.

140
00:20:19,661 --> 00:20:22,039
They say Walsingham
will return from France.

141
00:20:22,122 --> 00:20:24,166
Walsingham is nothing!

142
00:20:31,673 --> 00:20:33,884
Be sure he does not.

143
00:20:33,967 --> 00:20:38,806
There is so little beauty in this world,
and so much suffering.

144
00:20:40,766 --> 00:20:43,852
Do you suppose
that is what God had in mind?

145
00:20:44,978 --> 00:20:47,856
That is to say, if there is a God at all.

146
00:20:50,025 --> 00:20:53,278
Perhaps there is nothing
in this universe but ourselves

147
00:20:54,279 --> 00:20:56,323
and our thoughts.

148
00:21:03,789 --> 00:21:05,833
Think before you do this.

149
00:21:15,509 --> 00:21:17,928
If you must do it,

150
00:21:18,011 --> 00:21:20,055
then do it now.

151
00:21:21,265 --> 00:21:23,559
And without regret.

152
00:21:23,642 --> 00:21:25,811
But first think carefully

153
00:21:29,314 --> 00:21:31,358
and be certain

154
00:21:31,525 --> 00:21:33,569
why it needs to be done.

155
00:21:53,630 --> 00:21:55,674
Look out there.

156
00:21:56,925 --> 00:21:59,595
There is a whole world waiting for you.

157
00:22:01,597 --> 00:22:05,726
Innocence
is the most precious thing you possess.

158
00:22:06,643 --> 00:22:09,730
Lose that and you lose your soul.

159
00:22:25,496 --> 00:22:26,955
...et Spiritus Sancti...

160
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:28,165
Amen.

161
00:22:28,248 --> 00:22:29,875
Father...

162
00:22:29,958 --> 00:22:32,503
- Sir William!
- My Lady...

163
00:22:32,586 --> 00:22:35,881
There was nowhere else
we could meet in safety.

164
00:22:35,964 --> 00:22:38,217
Listen to me carefully.

165
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:40,636
All things move in our favour.

166
00:22:40,719 --> 00:22:44,264
Many of our friends
are returning from exile.

167
00:22:44,348 --> 00:22:47,726
But these are most uncertain times

168
00:22:47,810 --> 00:22:50,145
and your life remains in danger.

169
00:22:50,229 --> 00:22:52,815
You must therefore say nothing

170
00:22:52,898 --> 00:22:56,610
and meet no-one
whose visit may compromise you.

171
00:22:56,694 --> 00:22:57,986
No-one?

172
00:22:58,070 --> 00:23:00,948
No-one. Not even Lord Robert.

173
00:23:01,031 --> 00:23:06,578
- But he is a trusted friend.
- Child, listen to me. Please.

174
00:23:06,662 --> 00:23:10,708
You are most innocent
in the ways of this world

175
00:23:10,791 --> 00:23:12,876
and we must do all we may

176
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:16,088
to guarantee the security of your throne.

177
00:23:16,171 --> 00:23:19,299
Now there is someone
I do wish you to meet.

178
00:23:19,383 --> 00:23:22,678
Monseigneur Alvaro de la Quadra,
the Spanish Ambassador.

179
00:23:22,761 --> 00:23:23,804
Why do I...

180
00:23:28,016 --> 00:23:29,852
My Lady,

181
00:23:29,935 --> 00:23:33,105
I bring a message.

182
00:23:33,188 --> 00:23:38,193
The King of Spain is enraptured,
and offers you his hand in marriage.

183
00:23:38,277 --> 00:23:40,779
My sister is not yet dead.

184
00:23:40,863 --> 00:23:43,115
Her bed is still warm.

185
00:23:43,699 --> 00:23:46,577
His Majesty finds it already cold.

186
00:23:59,548 --> 00:24:01,592
You must sign it.

187
00:24:01,675 --> 00:24:04,970
For the love of God, sign it.

188
00:24:08,307 --> 00:24:11,393
Will you leave your kingdom to a heretic?

189
00:24:17,941 --> 00:24:21,987
He then said that this King
would marry me

190
00:24:22,071 --> 00:24:26,658
but would not expect to share my bed
more than two or three times a year.

191
00:24:26,742 --> 00:24:28,410
As much as that?

192
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:33,248
Well, he...

193
00:24:33,332 --> 00:24:35,209
He is enraptured.

194
00:24:35,292 --> 00:24:36,293
Naturally.

195
00:24:38,796 --> 00:24:42,758
But... his affairs would otherwise
keep him in Spain.

196
00:24:44,468 --> 00:24:46,720
Then the King is a fool.

197
00:24:50,557 --> 00:24:54,686
What could ever be important enough
to keep him from your bed?

198
00:25:05,364 --> 00:25:06,782
Robert,

199
00:25:06,865 --> 00:25:09,243
you should not say such things.

200
00:25:09,326 --> 00:25:11,370
Then I shall only think them.

201
00:25:15,582 --> 00:25:21,422
Everything is so uncertain!
Sir William says my life is still in danger.

202
00:25:21,505 --> 00:25:25,175
Do not listen to everything he tells you.
Do not listen to any of them.

203
00:25:25,259 --> 00:25:26,969
None of them are of consequence.

204
00:25:27,052 --> 00:25:31,140
- When you are Queen...
- I am not... I am not Queen yet.

205
00:25:31,223 --> 00:25:33,183
You will be.

206
00:25:33,267 --> 00:25:34,977
Elizabeth,

207
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:37,020
Queen of England.

208
00:25:38,147 --> 00:25:40,566
A court to worship you.

209
00:25:40,649 --> 00:25:42,735
A country to obey you.

210
00:25:42,818 --> 00:25:45,738
Poems written celebrating your beauty.

211
00:25:45,821 --> 00:25:50,492
Music composed in your honour,
and they will be nothing to you.

212
00:25:51,368 --> 00:25:53,412
I will mean nothing to you.

213
00:25:58,542 --> 00:26:01,086
How could you ever be nothing to me?

214
00:26:04,298 --> 00:26:07,384
Robert, you know
you are everything to me.

215
00:26:08,177 --> 00:26:10,220
All that I am

216
00:26:10,304 --> 00:26:12,347
it is you.

217
00:26:19,354 --> 00:26:21,023
Benedicta tu in mulieribus

218
00:26:21,106 --> 00:26:25,235
et benedictus fructus ventris tui, Iesus.

219
00:26:26,153 --> 00:26:28,197
Sancta Maria, Mater Dei

220
00:26:29,323 --> 00:26:32,409
ora pro nobis peccatoribus, nunc...

221
00:26:36,955 --> 00:26:38,999
Is she dead?

222
00:26:58,435 --> 00:27:00,479
Give it to her.

223
00:27:27,005 --> 00:27:28,590
My Lady...

224
00:27:32,636 --> 00:27:35,097
The Earl of Sussex is here.

225
00:28:26,315 --> 00:28:28,359
The Queen is dead!

226
00:28:28,817 --> 00:28:30,861
Long live the Queen!

227
00:28:33,655 --> 00:28:35,866
Long live the Queen!

228
00:28:43,499 --> 00:28:45,834
This is the Lord's doing

229
00:28:47,669 --> 00:28:53,467
and it is marvellous in our eyes.

230
00:28:56,678 --> 00:28:59,640
To the north, I present unto you

231
00:28:59,723 --> 00:29:02,768
Elizabeth, your undoubted Queen!

232
00:29:05,270 --> 00:29:07,523
To the south, I present to you

233
00:29:07,606 --> 00:29:10,484
Elizabeth, your undoubted Queen!

234
00:30:27,895 --> 00:30:29,938
I crown thee Elizabeth,

235
00:30:30,731 --> 00:30:35,903
Queen of England, Ireland and France.

236
00:31:08,435 --> 00:31:10,896
God save Your Majesty.

237
00:31:15,609 --> 00:31:21,365
Your Majesty has inherited
a most parlous and degenerate state.

238
00:31:21,448 --> 00:31:24,952
It's threatened from abroad
by France and Spain

239
00:31:25,035 --> 00:31:28,497
and is weaker in men, monies and riches

240
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:30,541
than I have ever known it.

241
00:31:30,624 --> 00:31:32,126
What are you saying?

242
00:31:32,209 --> 00:31:36,547
Madam, your treasury is empty.
The Navy is run-down,

243
00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:39,925
there is no standing army,
and no munitions.

244
00:31:40,008 --> 00:31:44,346
There is not a fortress
that could withstand a single shot.

245
00:31:44,430 --> 00:31:48,350
- I have no desire for war, sir.
- But that is not the end of it.

246
00:31:48,434 --> 00:31:52,187
Here at home there are those
who wish Your Majesty ill.

247
00:31:52,271 --> 00:31:56,442
Mary of Scots has already
laid claim to your throne,

248
00:31:56,525 --> 00:31:58,444
and Norfolk...

249
00:31:58,527 --> 00:32:01,530
Norfolk covets it relentlessly.

250
00:32:01,613 --> 00:32:06,160
Madam, until you marry
and produce an heir,

251
00:32:07,036 --> 00:32:09,705
you will find no security.

252
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,764
That's Sir Christopher Hatton.

253
00:32:38,859 --> 00:32:41,111
- There is Sir William Makepeace...
- I do not see...

254
00:32:41,195 --> 00:32:42,654
- Lord Ensley, Your Majesty.
- Delighted.

255
00:32:42,738 --> 00:32:46,283
I do not see why a woman
need marry at all.

256
00:33:00,005 --> 00:33:02,299
Come on, come on!

257
00:33:03,550 --> 00:33:05,594
This is Mistress Quickly.

258
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:25,364
You will recall His Excellency
the Spanish Ambassador.

259
00:33:25,447 --> 00:33:27,491
How could I forget?

260
00:33:27,574 --> 00:33:28,575
Excellency.

261
00:33:28,659 --> 00:33:30,703
Your Majesty.

262
00:33:35,082 --> 00:33:36,834
He's French. You'll have to speak up.

263
00:33:45,843 --> 00:33:47,886
Do I know that gentleman?

264
00:33:48,429 --> 00:33:53,308
That is Sir Francis Walsingham, Madam.
He has returned from exile

265
00:33:53,392 --> 00:33:57,813
and I have appointed him
to have a care for Your Majesty's person.

266
00:34:04,987 --> 00:34:06,822
Ah!

267
00:34:07,114 --> 00:34:08,699
Excellency...

268
00:34:10,242 --> 00:34:11,243
Majesty...

269
00:34:17,458 --> 00:34:22,713
May I present the French Ambassador,
His Excellency Monsieur de Foix.

270
00:34:22,796 --> 00:34:24,590
Your Excellency.

271
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:30,429
I suppose the French
do offer some suitor to her.

272
00:34:30,512 --> 00:34:32,431
Naturally.

273
00:34:32,514 --> 00:34:36,518
Everything now depends
upon the husband that woman takes.

274
00:34:36,602 --> 00:34:38,771
King Henry of Anjou
sends you brotherly love.

275
00:34:38,854 --> 00:34:44,651
He trusts the relationship between
our countries may be much improved.

276
00:34:44,735 --> 00:34:46,111
That is also my hope.

277
00:34:46,195 --> 00:34:51,158
The King expects that you will
consider the suit of his brother,

278
00:34:51,241 --> 00:34:53,744
the Duke of Anjou.

279
00:34:53,827 --> 00:34:57,664
Her Majesty will consider
the proposal most carefully.

280
00:35:01,001 --> 00:35:05,839
It is unfortunate, however,
that the Duke's aunt, Mary of Guise,

281
00:35:05,923 --> 00:35:09,468
chooses to garrison Scotland
with French troops.

282
00:35:13,472 --> 00:35:14,890
Ladies...

283
00:35:19,228 --> 00:35:24,942
The marriage of a Queen, Excellency,
is born of politics, not childish passion.

284
00:35:33,575 --> 00:35:34,743
Your Grace.

285
00:35:34,827 --> 00:35:36,870
Walsingham!

286
00:35:39,665 --> 00:35:41,709
Welcome to England.

287
00:35:41,792 --> 00:35:44,586
- Your Grace is surprised?
- No.

288
00:35:44,670 --> 00:35:46,755
Only a little disappointed.

289
00:36:31,675 --> 00:36:33,719
Play a volta!

290
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:30,776
When may I see you in private?

291
00:37:32,152 --> 00:37:33,237
In private?

292
00:37:34,822 --> 00:37:36,865
Have you forgot, my Lord?

293
00:37:38,158 --> 00:37:39,993
I am Queen now.

294
00:37:59,555 --> 00:38:00,931
He's coming.

295
00:38:01,014 --> 00:38:02,182
He's coming!

296
00:38:15,612 --> 00:38:17,614
My Ladies.

297
00:38:17,698 --> 00:38:19,742
My Lord.

298
00:38:21,827 --> 00:38:25,039
You blush, Lady Knollys.

299
00:38:25,122 --> 00:38:27,332
Are you in love?

300
00:38:27,416 --> 00:38:29,084
No, my Lord.

301
00:38:29,168 --> 00:38:32,254
Then you should be,
or waste all that beauty.

302
00:38:41,722 --> 00:38:43,766
Does Her Majesty sleep?

303
00:38:44,433 --> 00:38:46,477
Not yet, Sir William.

304
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,812
She is... overwrought.

305
00:38:49,897 --> 00:38:52,983
Show me Her Majesty's sheets
every morning.

306
00:38:53,067 --> 00:38:58,238
- I must know all her proper functions.
- Proper functions, Sir William?

307
00:38:58,322 --> 00:39:00,366
Indeed.

308
00:39:02,534 --> 00:39:07,873
Her Majesty's body and person
are no longer her own property.

309
00:39:07,956 --> 00:39:10,084
They belong to the State.

310
00:39:10,167 --> 00:39:12,211
Yes, Sir William.

311
00:41:01,403 --> 00:41:02,988
Your Grace.

312
00:41:03,072 --> 00:41:05,449
Your Grace, Her Majesty has not risen.

313
00:41:05,532 --> 00:41:07,368
Your Grace!

314
00:41:07,910 --> 00:41:12,373
Please! Your Grace! Her Majesty
is not yet ready to receive visitors.

315
00:41:12,456 --> 00:41:14,291
Madam!

316
00:41:17,002 --> 00:41:20,297
You had best get up.
There is some grave news.

317
00:41:25,594 --> 00:41:27,638
My Lady, I'm sorry...

318
00:41:27,721 --> 00:41:32,518
Mary of Guise has increased the French
garrison in Scotland by 4,000 men.

319
00:41:32,601 --> 00:41:35,104
Perhaps more.

320
00:41:35,187 --> 00:41:36,730
Madam...

321
00:41:36,814 --> 00:41:41,360
I'm afraid the French mean to attack
while we are still weak

322
00:41:41,443 --> 00:41:45,030
and while Your Majesty's reign
is still uncertain.

323
00:41:48,075 --> 00:41:50,119
What is your counsel?

324
00:41:50,202 --> 00:41:55,040
Madam, we must with all haste
raise an army to march upon Scotland.

325
00:41:59,837 --> 00:42:01,880
Can... can...?

326
00:42:05,926 --> 00:42:07,970
Can we not send emissaries?

327
00:42:08,053 --> 00:42:12,433
There is no time for that!
As Queen we look to you for action,

328
00:42:12,516 --> 00:42:18,439
unless you are content to wait for the
French to send more reinforcements.

329
00:42:18,522 --> 00:42:19,982
Here.

330
00:42:34,872 --> 00:42:36,915
Are you all in agreement?

331
00:42:36,999 --> 00:42:42,046
I say there has never been a better time
to abate the French pride.

332
00:42:42,129 --> 00:42:43,130
Arundel?

333
00:42:44,089 --> 00:42:48,218
War is a sin,
but sometimes a necessary one.

334
00:42:52,014 --> 00:42:57,186
Lord Robert, you were appointed to the
Council to protect England's interests.

335
00:42:57,269 --> 00:43:00,356
Now it appears
you do not have the stomach for it.

336
00:43:00,439 --> 00:43:02,274
I am in agreement, Your Grace,

337
00:43:02,358 --> 00:43:07,154
if Your Majesty's throne is at risk.

338
00:43:14,787 --> 00:43:18,123
- What say you, Walsingham?
- Your Majesty!

339
00:43:18,207 --> 00:43:21,543
I say a prince should rather
be slow to take action

340
00:43:21,627 --> 00:43:27,216
and should watch that he does not
come to be afraid of his own shadow.

341
00:43:27,299 --> 00:43:31,595
You are not, Sir Francis,
a member of Council,

342
00:43:31,678 --> 00:43:33,680
nor are you in the majority.

343
00:43:35,683 --> 00:43:37,726
I do not like wars.

344
00:43:39,061 --> 00:43:41,522
They have uncertain outcomes.

345
00:46:40,576 --> 00:46:42,828
Go back to England,

346
00:46:42,911 --> 00:46:45,414
and take this to your Queen.

347
00:47:16,862 --> 00:47:20,282
- Where are my councillors?
- I know not, Madam.

348
00:47:20,366 --> 00:47:24,953
- Where is Lord Robert?
- Lord Robert, Madam, has gone hunting.

349
00:47:29,750 --> 00:47:31,794
Leave me.

350
00:47:31,877 --> 00:47:33,921
Go! Go!

351
00:47:38,008 --> 00:47:42,930
I regret to inform Your Majesty
of our miserable defeat in Scotland.

352
00:47:43,013 --> 00:47:46,308
The Bishops still demand
Your Majesty's removal.

353
00:47:46,392 --> 00:47:49,395
They find support in every quarter.

354
00:47:50,604 --> 00:47:54,316
Alas, Madam,
we are come already to catastrophe.

355
00:48:28,392 --> 00:48:31,270
How dare you come into my presence!

356
00:48:34,314 --> 00:48:36,358
Why do you follow me here?

357
00:48:36,442 --> 00:48:39,945
It is my business
to protect Your Majesty

358
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:43,323
against all things.

359
00:48:43,407 --> 00:48:47,453
I do not need protection.
I need to be left alone!

360
00:48:47,536 --> 00:48:49,580
Majesty...

361
00:48:50,581 --> 00:48:54,168
They should never have been
sent to Scotland.

362
00:48:56,503 --> 00:49:00,007
My father would not have made
such a mistake.

363
00:49:01,467 --> 00:49:04,053
I have been proved unfit to rule.

364
00:49:05,596 --> 00:49:09,725
That is what you all think,
is it not, Walsingham?

365
00:49:09,808 --> 00:49:11,810
It is not for me to judge you.

366
00:49:14,605 --> 00:49:19,943
Why did they send children! Why
did they not send proper reinforcements!

367
00:49:20,027 --> 00:49:22,696
The Bishops would not let them.

368
00:49:22,780 --> 00:49:25,991
They spoke against it in the pulpits.

369
00:49:26,075 --> 00:49:30,412
Then... they are speaking
against their Queen.

370
00:49:30,496 --> 00:49:34,917
Madam, the Bishops are against you
and have no fear of you.

371
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,669
They do not expect you to survive.

372
00:49:50,474 --> 00:49:52,518
My Lord! The Queen!

373
00:50:15,791 --> 00:50:17,835
Where have you been?

374
00:50:22,297 --> 00:50:24,341
You were not at Court.

375
00:50:26,844 --> 00:50:28,887
Majesty, Monsieur de Foix.

376
00:50:28,971 --> 00:50:31,015
Mary of Guise, Ma'am,

377
00:50:31,098 --> 00:50:35,436
promises to make no further threat
against Your Majesty, but

378
00:50:35,519 --> 00:50:37,563
on one condition.

379
00:50:37,980 --> 00:50:40,024
What condition?

380
00:50:40,733 --> 00:50:46,530
That Your Majesty considers the proposal
of her nephew the Duke of Anjou.

381
00:50:54,788 --> 00:50:58,667
The Duke is most eager
to meet Your Majesty.

382
00:50:58,751 --> 00:51:01,837
He has heard a great deal of your beauty.

383
00:51:02,629 --> 00:51:07,718
For the love of God, Madam, let not
the care of your diseased estate

384
00:51:07,801 --> 00:51:10,721
hang in the balance any longer.

385
00:51:10,804 --> 00:51:15,351
In marriage,
and in the production of an heir,

386
00:51:15,434 --> 00:51:18,145
lies your only surety.

387
00:51:18,145 --> 00:51:21,148
The Duke is also most... handsome.

388
00:51:32,785 --> 00:51:34,828
Very well.

389
00:51:36,872 --> 00:51:38,582
Invite the Duke of Anjou.

390
00:51:40,084 --> 00:51:42,544
We shall see him in the flesh.

391
00:51:52,846 --> 00:51:54,890
Robert!

392
00:51:54,973 --> 00:51:59,687
The Duke will not take kindly
to a rival for his suit.

393
00:51:59,770 --> 00:52:03,607
He is a traitor,
and his father before him.

394
00:52:03,691 --> 00:52:08,612
Lord Robert's head
will end up on a spike,

395
00:52:08,696 --> 00:52:11,323
not on the pillow of a Queen.

396
00:52:24,086 --> 00:52:26,130
Must you leave?

397
00:52:26,213 --> 00:52:29,091
I would not miss this for the world.

398
00:52:30,008 --> 00:52:34,138
Today I shall watch the fall
of that heretic girl.

399
00:52:37,891 --> 00:52:42,021
I have been placed here
as your sov...

400
00:52:47,818 --> 00:52:51,238
I am your sovereign.
I have been placed here...

401
00:52:53,949 --> 00:52:55,659
I...

402
00:52:55,743 --> 00:52:59,121
God has... God has placed me here...

403
00:52:59,204 --> 00:53:01,999
I am your anointed sovereign...

404
00:53:02,082 --> 00:53:05,544
I am your Queen...
And like my father I mean to rule.

405
00:53:05,627 --> 00:53:10,549
There is one thing higher than royalty,
my Lords, and that

406
00:53:11,550 --> 00:53:13,594
is religion.

407
00:53:14,887 --> 00:53:16,972
I pass this... I pass this Act of...

408
00:53:17,056 --> 00:53:18,974
I ask you to pa... I...

409
00:53:19,058 --> 00:53:22,144
I ask you to pass this Act of Uniformity.

410
00:53:22,227 --> 00:53:24,104
Not for myself. For my people.

411
00:53:26,440 --> 00:53:28,484
They're my people...

412
00:53:29,109 --> 00:53:32,571
There is one God. We have
a common... There is one God.

413
00:53:34,198 --> 00:53:37,618
This is for my people.
My people are my care.

414
00:53:37,701 --> 00:53:39,745
The only care.

415
00:53:39,828 --> 00:53:43,290
My Lords, your votes are nothing
without my consent.

416
00:53:57,179 --> 00:54:03,227
If there is no uniformity
of religious belief here

417
00:54:03,310 --> 00:54:07,856
then there can only be fragmentation.

418
00:54:09,817 --> 00:54:11,860
Disputes and quarrels.

419
00:54:14,113 --> 00:54:20,119
Surely, my Lords, it is better
to have a single Church of England.

420
00:54:29,795 --> 00:54:32,631
A single Church of England!

421
00:54:32,715 --> 00:54:35,259
With a common prayer book.

422
00:54:35,342 --> 00:54:37,386
And... and a...

423
00:54:39,888 --> 00:54:42,933
And... a common purpose.

424
00:54:47,896 --> 00:54:51,025
I ask you to pass
this Act of Uniformity

425
00:54:51,108 --> 00:54:53,610
not... not for myself

426
00:54:55,654 --> 00:54:58,532
but for my people

427
00:55:00,826 --> 00:55:03,704
who are my only care.

428
00:55:03,954 --> 00:55:05,998
Madam, by this Act,

429
00:55:06,457 --> 00:55:11,211
you force us to relinquish
our allegiance to the Holy Father.

430
00:55:11,295 --> 00:55:14,048
Hear, hear!

431
00:55:16,133 --> 00:55:18,635
How can I force you, Your Grace?

432
00:55:18,719 --> 00:55:20,763
I am a woman.

433
00:55:23,766 --> 00:55:28,312
I have no desire
to make windows into men's souls.

434
00:55:30,397 --> 00:55:32,441
I simply ask

435
00:55:33,650 --> 00:55:35,694
can any man, in truth,

436
00:55:37,363 --> 00:55:39,615
serve two masters

437
00:55:39,698 --> 00:55:42,409
and be faithful to both?

438
00:55:42,493 --> 00:55:44,703
Madam, this is heresy!

439
00:55:44,787 --> 00:55:47,498
No, Your Grace, this is

440
00:55:47,581 --> 00:55:49,625
common sense.

441
00:55:49,708 --> 00:55:52,795
Which is a most English virtue.

442
00:55:55,756 --> 00:55:58,634
Where is Gardiner?
Where are the others?

443
00:55:58,717 --> 00:56:00,219
Let us out!

444
00:56:00,302 --> 00:56:02,346
Open the door!

445
00:56:05,057 --> 00:56:07,768
This is Walsingham's doing.

446
00:56:08,102 --> 00:56:10,145
It is the devil's work.

447
00:56:10,229 --> 00:56:12,898
It will not serve her in any case.

448
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:18,237
The Bishops will pass no measure
which severs us from Rome.

449
00:56:21,198 --> 00:56:25,244
Your Majesty would improve
all these matters

450
00:56:25,327 --> 00:56:27,621
if you would agree to marry.

451
00:56:27,705 --> 00:56:29,748
Aye. Marry, Madam.

452
00:56:30,582 --> 00:56:34,712
Aye. But marry who, Your Grace?

453
00:56:35,671 --> 00:56:38,549
Will you give me some suggestion?

454
00:56:39,883 --> 00:56:44,013
For some say France,
and others Spain, and

455
00:56:44,138 --> 00:56:47,558
and some cannot abide foreigners at all.

456
00:56:47,641 --> 00:56:52,771
So I'm not sure how best to please you
unless I married one of each.

457
00:56:57,735 --> 00:57:01,822
Now Your Majesty does make fun
of the sanctity of marriage.

458
00:57:01,905 --> 00:57:06,618
I do not think you should lecture me
on that, my Lord,

459
00:57:06,702 --> 00:57:10,831
since you yourself
have been twice divorced.

460
00:57:10,914 --> 00:57:13,959
And are now upon your third wife!

461
00:57:20,340 --> 00:57:24,470
Each of you must vote
according to your conscience.

462
00:57:26,388 --> 00:57:28,432
But remember this.

463
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:31,852
In your hands,

464
00:57:32,728 --> 00:57:34,980
upon this moment,

465
00:57:35,939 --> 00:57:40,069
lies the future happiness of my people,

466
00:57:40,152 --> 00:57:42,446
and the peace

467
00:57:42,529 --> 00:57:44,573
of this realm.

468
00:57:46,367 --> 00:57:50,788
Let that be upon your conscience also.

469
00:57:57,461 --> 00:58:00,172
My Lords, the House will divide.

470
00:58:09,390 --> 00:58:11,433
Walsingham...!

471
00:58:11,517 --> 00:58:16,021
I would know on what authority
you have kept us locked up here.

472
00:58:16,105 --> 00:58:20,067
Your Graces must forgive me,
but you are now free to go.

473
00:58:20,150 --> 00:58:24,697
I am sure this infernal work
has not saved your bastard Queen.

474
00:58:26,115 --> 00:58:28,867
Her Majesty... has won the argument.

475
00:58:29,910 --> 00:58:31,954
By what count?

476
00:58:32,871 --> 00:58:35,457
By five, Your Grace.

477
00:58:37,126 --> 00:58:39,169
Five.

478
00:58:41,004 --> 00:58:43,298
You will be damned for this!

479
00:58:43,382 --> 00:58:47,511
And I pray God your wretched soul
will burn in hell!

480
00:59:28,344 --> 00:59:31,055
Report back to me at break of day.

481
01:00:16,016 --> 01:00:18,227
Enchanté.

482
01:00:22,398 --> 01:00:23,273
No!

483
01:00:23,357 --> 01:00:26,860
Because... I am Anjou!

484
01:00:29,822 --> 01:00:32,700
Yes, I am Anjou, yes! I am Anjou.

485
01:00:46,922 --> 01:00:48,966
And I can't wait...

486
01:01:01,020 --> 01:01:02,813
Would you like that?

487
01:01:02,896 --> 01:01:05,065
Remove your hand.

488
01:01:05,149 --> 01:01:08,235
Perhaps, Your Grace,
we shall think on it, but...

489
01:01:08,318 --> 01:01:12,448
- I am deeply religious.
- But I am very religious, too.

490
01:01:12,531 --> 01:01:15,409
Very religious, yes!

491
01:01:31,258 --> 01:01:35,387
Your Holiness,
the priest from England is here.

492
01:01:54,782 --> 01:02:00,454
Tell me, my son, what is the news
of our brothers and sisters in England?

493
01:02:00,954 --> 01:02:06,001
Do they still support the sovereignty
of that illegitimate whore?

494
01:02:06,085 --> 01:02:07,711
No, Holy Father.

495
01:02:07,795 --> 01:02:12,424
They pray ceaselessly that England
may be recovered from heresy.

496
01:02:12,508 --> 01:02:15,636
Prayers may not be sufficient.

497
01:02:15,719 --> 01:02:18,138
I will ask for guidance in this matter.

498
01:02:18,222 --> 01:02:20,683
But do not despair.

499
01:02:20,766 --> 01:02:26,855
Was it not truly said
that the righteous shall inherit the earth?

500
01:02:38,617 --> 01:02:40,661
Such piercing eyes!

501
01:02:40,744 --> 01:02:42,788
And very indiscreet!

502
01:03:15,529 --> 01:03:19,324
My true love has my heart

503
01:03:20,367 --> 01:03:22,411
and I have hers.

504
01:03:22,828 --> 01:03:24,872
My heart in me

505
01:03:24,955 --> 01:03:27,416
keeps her and me in one.

506
01:03:27,624 --> 01:03:32,296
My heart in her,
her thoughts and senses guide.

507
01:03:32,379 --> 01:03:34,631
She loves my heart

508
01:03:35,215 --> 01:03:38,010
for once it was her own.

509
01:03:39,094 --> 01:03:41,138
I cherish hers

510
01:03:42,639 --> 01:03:45,517
because in me it bides.

511
01:03:48,145 --> 01:03:50,606
My true love has my heart

512
01:03:50,689 --> 01:03:52,358
and I

513
01:03:52,441 --> 01:03:53,942
have hers.

514
01:03:54,026 --> 01:03:55,027
Marry me.

515
01:04:12,461 --> 01:04:14,505
Marry me.

516
01:04:56,213 --> 01:04:58,257
On a night such as this

517
01:04:58,340 --> 01:05:00,384
could any woman say no?

518
01:05:02,052 --> 01:05:04,096
On a night such as this

519
01:05:05,055 --> 01:05:07,099
could a Queen say no?

520
01:05:07,975 --> 01:05:12,604
Does not a Queen sit under
the same stars as any other woman?

521
01:05:16,275 --> 01:05:18,318
Monseigneur Alvaro!

522
01:05:19,028 --> 01:05:20,612
Monseigneur Alvaro!

523
01:05:20,696 --> 01:05:22,489
Tell me,

524
01:05:22,573 --> 01:05:26,702
as well as Ambassador,
are you not also a Bishop?

525
01:05:28,162 --> 01:05:30,539
I am, my Lord.

526
01:05:30,622 --> 01:05:32,332
Then you can marry us!

527
01:05:34,251 --> 01:05:36,503
Marry you?

528
01:05:37,504 --> 01:05:42,051
Perhaps he does not know enough
English to perform the ceremony!

529
01:05:42,134 --> 01:05:46,263
Alas, Madam, in this matter
I can be of no help to you.

530
01:05:50,142 --> 01:05:51,560
Madam!

531
01:05:54,063 --> 01:05:55,522
The Queen!

532
01:05:55,606 --> 01:05:57,775
- Protect the Queen!
- Help her!

533
01:05:58,901 --> 01:06:01,153
Quickly! Call the Guard!

534
01:06:04,073 --> 01:06:06,617
The Queen! The Queen!

535
01:06:06,700 --> 01:06:08,952
Look to the Queen!

536
01:06:20,631 --> 01:06:23,759
Isabel, see that the ladies are prepared.

537
01:06:23,842 --> 01:06:24,843
Isabel, go!

538
01:06:24,927 --> 01:06:26,970
Where were you, Sir Francis?

539
01:06:27,054 --> 01:06:33,268
I only hope that Her Majesty may be
safely delivered from this present danger.

540
01:06:36,689 --> 01:06:38,732
Is the bedchamber ready?

541
01:06:38,816 --> 01:06:41,235
Be calm, Madam. All is well.

542
01:06:41,318 --> 01:06:43,362
I am perfectly well.

543
01:06:43,987 --> 01:06:46,031
Please do not fuss.

544
01:06:50,452 --> 01:06:53,789
- No-one is to enter.
- Yes, Sir William.

545
01:06:55,666 --> 01:06:59,586
- Stay in here now, and watch.
- Yes, Sir Francis.

546
01:07:07,636 --> 01:07:09,388
Sorry, Lord Robert.

547
01:07:13,183 --> 01:07:14,435
I said no-one.

548
01:07:27,156 --> 01:07:29,074
My Lord,

549
01:07:29,158 --> 01:07:30,826
a word.

550
01:07:49,261 --> 01:07:51,722
To whose advantage was this?

551
01:07:51,805 --> 01:07:53,682
De Foix?

552
01:07:55,976 --> 01:07:57,603
No.

553
01:07:57,686 --> 01:07:59,730
Not with Anjou in play.

554
01:08:00,522 --> 01:08:02,941
Then some... madman?

555
01:08:03,025 --> 01:08:05,986
There is always madness, Master Elyot.

556
01:08:06,070 --> 01:08:09,782
This was devised.
There is reason behind it.

557
01:08:10,366 --> 01:08:12,409
Then Alvaro

558
01:08:12,493 --> 01:08:14,787
for he has most cause.

559
01:08:14,870 --> 01:08:16,997
Yes, but he was present.

560
01:08:17,081 --> 01:08:19,333
He is too subtle for that.

561
01:08:20,376 --> 01:08:22,461
Would Norfolk?

562
01:08:22,544 --> 01:08:26,632
He is not so subtle
and has even more cause.

563
01:08:26,715 --> 01:08:28,759
Indeed.

564
01:08:28,842 --> 01:08:30,511
So then

565
01:08:30,594 --> 01:08:33,681
he is not in league with the Spanish.

566
01:08:33,764 --> 01:08:36,266
Perhaps. Stay close to him.

567
01:08:36,350 --> 01:08:38,852
The Duke has some other game.

568
01:08:38,936 --> 01:08:41,480
I must find where he plays.

569
01:08:42,648 --> 01:08:47,194
I see it is true that the Queen
favours you above all others.

570
01:08:47,903 --> 01:08:52,032
But you have many enemies here.
Is it not so?

571
01:08:52,116 --> 01:08:54,576
That is no concern of yours.

572
01:08:56,412 --> 01:08:58,455
It may be.

573
01:08:58,706 --> 01:09:03,085
If you would be prepared,
in secret, to renounce heresy

574
01:09:03,168 --> 01:09:05,587
and embrace the true faith,

575
01:09:05,671 --> 01:09:10,134
then you might find
many new and powerful friends

576
01:09:11,176 --> 01:09:13,012
and

577
01:09:13,512 --> 01:09:15,556
keep your Queen.

578
01:09:17,975 --> 01:09:20,978
You are most mistaken, Monseigneur,

579
01:09:21,061 --> 01:09:24,481
if you think
I might so easily be persuaded

580
01:09:24,565 --> 01:09:26,859
to act against my conscience,

581
01:09:26,942 --> 01:09:29,319
and my love.

582
01:09:30,029 --> 01:09:32,072
My Lord,

583
01:09:33,365 --> 01:09:36,160
what will a man not do for love?

584
01:09:46,754 --> 01:09:50,132
Madam, if only you would heed my advice.

585
01:09:50,424 --> 01:09:56,013
I narrowly escaped with my life, sir.
I cannot now discuss marriage.

586
01:09:57,181 --> 01:10:01,727
Forgive me... the one
cannot be separated from the other.

587
01:10:01,810 --> 01:10:05,147
- Have I not told you?
- Yes, and I am sick of it.

588
01:10:05,230 --> 01:10:08,817
This entire conversation is ill-timed.

589
01:10:09,401 --> 01:10:12,613
My patience, Sir William, is not infinite.

590
01:10:24,166 --> 01:10:28,003
It is a great joy to see
Your Majesty is not hurt.

591
01:10:28,087 --> 01:10:30,339
It was a terrible affair.

592
01:10:31,507 --> 01:10:35,636
The Duke would still
know the answer to his suit.

593
01:10:36,095 --> 01:10:40,265
You may tell the Duke
he shall have his answer shortly.

594
01:10:40,349 --> 01:10:42,685
Madam, the point is pressing!

595
01:10:44,353 --> 01:10:50,234
The Duke cannot love me so much if
he demands my answer so precipitously!

596
01:10:50,317 --> 01:10:54,321
Perhaps Her Majesty's heart
is already set upon another.

597
01:10:57,825 --> 01:11:02,663
Do not presume, monsieur,
to know the secrets of my heart.

598
01:11:05,124 --> 01:11:07,584
Monsieur de Foix may leave.

599
01:11:08,711 --> 01:11:10,754
Please, Excellency...

600
01:11:10,879 --> 01:11:13,340
Je vous prie de mes excuses.

601
01:11:14,675 --> 01:11:16,719
Secrets, Madam?!

602
01:11:17,428 --> 01:11:19,471
You have no secrets!

603
01:11:19,555 --> 01:11:23,267
The world knows Lord Robert
visits your chambers and you

604
01:11:23,350 --> 01:11:25,394
fornicate with him!

605
01:11:25,477 --> 01:11:28,772
It's even said you already carry his child!

606
01:11:28,856 --> 01:11:33,777
Yes, Sir William, I live my life in the open!
I am surrounded by people!

607
01:11:33,861 --> 01:11:38,866
I do not understand how so bad
a judgement has been formed of me!

608
01:11:38,949 --> 01:11:40,909
Madam, you...

609
01:11:40,993 --> 01:11:42,786
You cannot marry Lord Robert!

610
01:11:48,667 --> 01:11:50,711
He is already married.

611
01:12:11,190 --> 01:12:13,650
Here comes our married man.

612
01:12:14,651 --> 01:12:17,321
Lord Dudley is not himself today.

613
01:12:17,821 --> 01:12:20,866
Lord Dudley's cup runneth over.

614
01:12:23,285 --> 01:12:27,039
Imagine being discovered
in another woman's bed!

615
01:12:27,122 --> 01:12:29,875
Aye, and that it to be his wife's!

616
01:12:40,886 --> 01:12:45,015
Lord Robert, we are amazed
you show your face at Court.

617
01:12:45,099 --> 01:12:47,142
The Queen!

618
01:13:21,218 --> 01:13:22,469
Spanish!

619
01:13:22,970 --> 01:13:24,346
Spanish!

620
01:13:26,390 --> 01:13:28,434
English pirate!

621
01:13:48,996 --> 01:13:51,040
English pirate!

622
01:13:51,123 --> 01:13:56,211
Is it not enough that English
pirates attack and rob our ships

623
01:13:56,295 --> 01:13:59,298
but we are to be made fools of
in this Court.

624
01:13:59,381 --> 01:14:04,553
The King, my master, has become
impatient for Your Grace to act.

625
01:14:06,388 --> 01:14:09,641
If you will not, then others may.

626
01:14:09,725 --> 01:14:13,729
You must reassure His Majesty
the time is close at hand.

627
01:14:13,812 --> 01:14:15,898
He must not act precipitously.

628
01:14:19,777 --> 01:14:23,781
- His Majesty has heard a rumour
- The world is filled with rumours.

629
01:14:23,864 --> 01:14:29,787
that Your Grace has made contact with
Mary of Scots to promote your ambitions.

630
01:14:29,870 --> 01:14:32,164
Even that you mean to marry her.

631
01:14:32,247 --> 01:14:34,792
Do you suppose me an idiot?

632
01:14:34,875 --> 01:14:40,130
Your master is the most powerful man
in the world. I would not cross him.

633
01:14:46,345 --> 01:14:48,847
Will the Duke not come to dance?

634
01:14:48,931 --> 01:14:53,852
Madam, His Grace is indisposed.
He has some pains of the stomach.

635
01:14:53,936 --> 01:14:55,562
Oh.

636
01:14:56,063 --> 01:14:58,524
I am very sorry for it.

637
01:15:05,322 --> 01:15:08,075
We wish to give the Duke this ring

638
01:15:09,243 --> 01:15:11,704
as a token of our love.

639
01:15:11,787 --> 01:15:14,248
- Madam...
- No.

640
01:15:14,331 --> 01:15:16,875
I shall give it to him myself.

641
01:15:16,959 --> 01:15:19,003
Madam, I should not...

642
01:15:19,086 --> 01:15:21,130
Sir William.

643
01:15:21,213 --> 01:15:23,048
Come along.

644
01:16:30,908 --> 01:16:32,951
What!

645
01:16:34,536 --> 01:16:36,580
What?

646
01:16:36,997 --> 01:16:38,624
What, er... what!

647
01:16:43,003 --> 01:16:45,047
You stare, Madam.

648
01:16:48,926 --> 01:16:50,969
What is it?

649
01:16:51,053 --> 01:16:53,097
Do you see

650
01:16:53,180 --> 01:16:55,849
something strange, perhaps?

651
01:16:59,853 --> 01:17:02,731
You are wearing a dress, Your Grace.

652
01:17:03,440 --> 01:17:07,861
Oh! Yes, I am wearing a dress.
Yes, yes, I am wearing a dress!

653
01:17:07,945 --> 01:17:11,156
I wear a dress like this,
my mother, and you.

654
01:17:11,240 --> 01:17:16,286
But I only dress like this when I'm alone,
in private, with my friends.

655
01:17:18,080 --> 01:17:20,124
Your Grace...

656
01:17:39,977 --> 01:17:43,230
Although my affection for you
is undiminished

657
01:17:43,313 --> 01:17:46,483
I have, after an agonising struggle,

658
01:17:46,567 --> 01:17:52,072
determined to sacrifice my own happiness
for the welfare of my people.

659
01:17:52,156 --> 01:17:53,490
My God!

660
01:18:00,414 --> 01:18:02,458
Madam, I will explain.

661
01:18:10,257 --> 01:18:11,633
Allez-vous-en, allez!

662
01:18:14,595 --> 01:18:16,638
Jouez! Jouez!

663
01:18:30,319 --> 01:18:33,072
Madam, is the, er... is the Duke...

664
01:18:33,155 --> 01:18:36,241
There will be no more talk of marriage.

665
01:18:54,927 --> 01:18:56,637
Lord Robert!

666
01:19:00,307 --> 01:19:02,351
Your Majesty?

667
01:19:04,520 --> 01:19:06,730
Will you dance?

668
01:19:09,149 --> 01:19:11,193
If it please you.

669
01:19:15,948 --> 01:19:17,991
Play a volta!

670
01:19:34,967 --> 01:19:37,094
Why will you not see me?

671
01:19:50,232 --> 01:19:52,609
You must let me explain.

672
01:19:52,693 --> 01:19:55,362
Others will take advantage of this.

673
01:19:55,446 --> 01:19:59,283
You must not believe
what they tell you. They are jealous

674
01:19:59,366 --> 01:20:02,995
and envious,
because I am nothing to them

675
01:20:03,078 --> 01:20:05,622
and everything to you.

676
01:20:05,956 --> 01:20:08,000
Do you love her?

677
01:20:12,212 --> 01:20:15,299
No, I love you.
I have always loved you.

678
01:20:15,382 --> 01:20:19,261
I was afraid of losing you
because I was not free!

679
01:20:19,345 --> 01:20:22,598
For God's sake,
you are still my Elizabeth!

680
01:20:25,100 --> 01:20:27,394
I am not your Elizabeth!

681
01:20:29,271 --> 01:20:31,315
I am no man's Elizabeth!

682
01:20:31,398 --> 01:20:34,443
And if you think to rule here
you are mistaken!

683
01:20:41,158 --> 01:20:43,243
I will have one mistress here

684
01:20:45,954 --> 01:20:47,998
and no master!

685
01:21:19,822 --> 01:21:23,992
It matters nothing to me.
I can live without her

686
01:21:24,284 --> 01:21:26,453
most happily.

687
01:21:26,537 --> 01:21:29,123
Better than I could live with her.

688
01:21:31,333 --> 01:21:36,130
I have no need of her love.
Have I not suffered enough already

689
01:21:36,213 --> 01:21:38,632
for loving her and showing it?

690
01:21:38,716 --> 01:21:40,759
I envy you, my Lord.

691
01:21:41,135 --> 01:21:43,637
To love a woman so deeply.

692
01:21:43,721 --> 01:21:48,142
Monseigneur... envy no man for that.

693
01:21:50,561 --> 01:21:52,980
Such love is hateful.

694
01:21:53,063 --> 01:21:57,568
It tears the soul apart. Envy a man
who has never known such love.

695
01:21:57,651 --> 01:22:01,905
Perhaps there may still be a way
to reclaim her affections.

696
01:22:01,989 --> 01:22:03,574
Why should I want to?

697
01:22:03,657 --> 01:22:05,534
And to save her life.

698
01:22:05,617 --> 01:22:08,328
- You jest with me.
- No, I do not.

699
01:22:08,412 --> 01:22:14,001
For she will be dead soon enough,
perhaps even at Norfolk's hand,

700
01:22:14,084 --> 01:22:16,128
if you do not help her.

701
01:22:17,421 --> 01:22:19,381
How can I help her?

702
01:22:21,467 --> 01:22:23,510
She will not even see me.

703
01:22:30,476 --> 01:22:32,978
His Holiness has issued the Bull.

704
01:22:33,062 --> 01:22:38,567
It deprives Elizabeth, pretended Queen
of England, servant of wickedness,

705
01:22:38,650 --> 01:22:40,694
of her throne,

706
01:22:40,778 --> 01:22:46,325
and declares that her subjects
are absolved of their allegiance to her.

707
01:22:48,744 --> 01:22:51,830
His Holiness also decrees that any man

708
01:22:51,914 --> 01:22:55,793
who should undertake her assassination

709
01:22:55,876 --> 01:23:00,005
will be welcomed by angels
into the Kingdom of Heaven.

710
01:23:01,131 --> 01:23:05,844
Give these letters of blessing
and hope to our friends in England.

711
01:23:54,393 --> 01:23:56,437
Your Grace.

712
01:23:56,603 --> 01:23:58,647
Monseigneur.

713
01:24:07,823 --> 01:24:09,867
And Thomas Elyot.

714
01:24:12,119 --> 01:24:14,580
You serve your master well, Elyot.

715
01:24:15,497 --> 01:24:17,541
As well as I can, in truth.

716
01:24:17,958 --> 01:24:20,002
I mean your real master.

717
01:24:21,628 --> 01:24:23,672
What's this?

718
01:24:23,922 --> 01:24:25,966
What master?

719
01:24:26,050 --> 01:24:27,634
Walsingham.

720
01:24:27,718 --> 01:24:30,804
The priest is mistaken, my Lord.

721
01:24:30,888 --> 01:24:34,391
I am Your Grace's servant,
as God is my witness.

722
01:25:19,144 --> 01:25:22,231
- Isabel...
- Sshh, don't fuss.

723
01:25:26,777 --> 01:25:31,699
You should not try them on, Isabel.
They are the Queen's dresses.

724
01:25:31,782 --> 01:25:33,826
Why not?

725
01:26:26,253 --> 01:26:28,297
You're my secret.

726
01:26:28,380 --> 01:26:30,424
I am Queen, aren't I?

727
01:26:31,008 --> 01:26:33,052
Say you're mine.

728
01:26:35,471 --> 01:26:37,514
You're my Elizabeth.

729
01:26:38,390 --> 01:26:40,434
Say you're my Elizabeth.

730
01:26:40,726 --> 01:26:42,770
I am your Elizabeth.

731
01:26:50,027 --> 01:26:52,112
I am your Queen!

732
01:27:00,788 --> 01:27:02,831
Ssh...!

733
01:27:05,042 --> 01:27:07,086
Sshh...!

734
01:27:29,400 --> 01:27:31,443
Kat?

735
01:27:33,737 --> 01:27:35,781
Kat!

736
01:27:49,128 --> 01:27:51,547
Kat?

737
01:27:59,555 --> 01:28:01,598
Who are you?

738
01:28:03,225 --> 01:28:05,811
You will declare yourself to me.

739
01:28:10,899 --> 01:28:12,359
Madam!

740
01:28:13,736 --> 01:28:18,073
Something has happened!
You must come quickly!

741
01:28:18,198 --> 01:28:20,242
Who was with her?

742
01:28:20,325 --> 01:28:24,913
One of the guards found her.
He says he saw Lord Robert leave...

743
01:28:24,997 --> 01:28:26,790
No, Madam, no.

744
01:28:26,874 --> 01:28:29,460
The dress was poisoned.

745
01:28:30,294 --> 01:28:32,880
Uncover her.

746
01:28:36,258 --> 01:28:38,927
No...! That dress was a gift

747
01:28:39,970 --> 01:28:42,014
for me.

748
01:28:42,931 --> 01:28:44,975
French silk.

749
01:29:03,243 --> 01:29:05,287
Vite! Vite!

750
01:29:24,390 --> 01:29:26,433
Sir Francis,

751
01:29:27,476 --> 01:29:31,105
you and I must be honest with each other.

752
01:29:35,984 --> 01:29:38,028
Your Queen is weak.

753
01:29:39,154 --> 01:29:41,198
She has no army,

754
01:29:41,281 --> 01:29:44,326
no friends. Only...

755
01:29:44,410 --> 01:29:46,036
Comment dit-on...?

756
01:29:46,912 --> 01:29:48,789
- Enemies.
- Enemies.

757
01:29:48,872 --> 01:29:50,666
Mm-hm.

758
01:29:50,749 --> 01:29:52,793
What terms can she propose?

759
01:29:53,293 --> 01:29:56,088
Madam, Her Majesty was, I believe,

760
01:29:56,171 --> 01:29:59,842
too hasty at rejecting
the Duke's proposal of marriage.

761
01:30:00,384 --> 01:30:03,095
But how can I marry such a woman?
Huh?

762
01:30:03,178 --> 01:30:05,014
She is frigid!

763
01:30:06,390 --> 01:30:09,643
Yes! They even say she is really a man!

764
01:30:16,233 --> 01:30:18,193
Forgive my nephew.

765
01:30:18,277 --> 01:30:20,696
He speaks when he should not.

766
01:30:20,779 --> 01:30:22,823
He is terrible.

767
01:30:34,543 --> 01:30:36,628
Ne fais pas l'idiot, Henri.

768
01:30:44,094 --> 01:30:48,140
I hear you are a wise man, Sir Francis,

769
01:30:48,223 --> 01:30:51,018
and a creature of the world

770
01:30:51,101 --> 01:30:52,644
like me.

771
01:30:59,276 --> 01:31:01,320
Yes.

772
01:31:03,947 --> 01:31:05,991
I have no illusions.

773
01:31:09,328 --> 01:31:12,414
I know it is only a matter of time

774
01:31:12,998 --> 01:31:15,876
before my Queen is overthrown.

775
01:31:20,297 --> 01:31:23,384
Her Majesty rules with the heart,

776
01:31:25,678 --> 01:31:27,763
not with the head.

777
01:31:27,846 --> 01:31:29,890
I understand.

778
01:31:30,557 --> 01:31:34,061
It is hard for a woman to forget her heart.

779
01:31:37,731 --> 01:31:39,775
But, er...

780
01:31:40,484 --> 01:31:42,528
what of you,

781
01:31:43,862 --> 01:31:45,906
Walsingham?

782
01:31:47,783 --> 01:31:52,413
A wise man would be careful
not to put himself in the way of harm.

783
01:31:55,207 --> 01:31:58,252
And how would a wise man do that?

784
01:31:59,003 --> 01:32:02,297
He would, as I said, change allegiance.

785
01:32:03,966 --> 01:32:06,010
Allegiance?

786
01:32:10,305 --> 01:32:12,391
There are but two choices.

787
01:32:13,434 --> 01:32:17,521
He would get into bed
with either Spain or France.

788
01:32:20,733 --> 01:32:22,776
And whose bed

789
01:32:22,860 --> 01:32:24,695
would you prefer?

790
01:32:42,379 --> 01:32:45,466
Your Majesty, may I speak with you?

791
01:32:45,549 --> 01:32:47,426
In private.

792
01:32:57,353 --> 01:32:59,396
Speak.

793
01:33:00,481 --> 01:33:03,150
You are in the greatest danger.

794
01:33:03,609 --> 01:33:06,070
You must believe me.

795
01:33:07,363 --> 01:33:09,406
But you have a friend.

796
01:33:09,490 --> 01:33:12,618
Someone who can guarantee your safety

797
01:33:13,869 --> 01:33:15,996
and your throne.

798
01:33:19,249 --> 01:33:21,293
A friend?

799
01:33:23,962 --> 01:33:26,006
The King of Spain.

800
01:33:29,510 --> 01:33:31,553
Leave us.

801
01:33:42,481 --> 01:33:44,775
How would he guarantee it?

802
01:33:48,362 --> 01:33:50,406
He would marry you.

803
01:33:53,367 --> 01:33:57,037
Only to make an alliance. Nothing more.

804
01:33:58,122 --> 01:34:00,457
He would not expect to...

805
01:34:01,542 --> 01:34:03,585
He would live in Spain.

806
01:34:06,005 --> 01:34:08,716
Why do you do this, Robert?

807
01:34:08,799 --> 01:34:11,593
Because I love you.

808
01:34:11,677 --> 01:34:16,724
And though you will not see me,
I am the only one who would care for you.

809
01:34:16,807 --> 01:34:21,145
You love me so much
you would have me be your whore?

810
01:34:27,943 --> 01:34:30,696
For God's sake, I do this for us.

811
01:34:30,779 --> 01:34:33,699
I ask you to save some part of us!

812
01:34:33,782 --> 01:34:39,580
Lord Robert, you may make whores of my
Ladies but you shall not make one of me.

813
01:34:48,630 --> 01:34:50,674
Your Majesty.

814
01:35:23,457 --> 01:35:25,501
Get out! Get out!

815
01:35:27,544 --> 01:35:30,005
Of course I shall deny it.

816
01:35:30,547 --> 01:35:36,178
Your Majesty must publicly dissociate
herself from this most bloody act.

817
01:35:36,261 --> 01:35:38,305
I never ordered it.

818
01:35:41,350 --> 01:35:43,811
Of course, Madam, of course.

819
01:35:43,894 --> 01:35:48,357
You must also make conciliatory gestures
towards the Spanish.

820
01:35:48,440 --> 01:35:52,736
Your dependence upon their goodwill
is greater than ever.

821
01:35:52,820 --> 01:35:56,323
- I must...
- The word "must" is not used to princes.

822
01:36:00,744 --> 01:36:05,916
I have followed your advice
in all the affairs of my kingdom, but

823
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:11,296
your policies would make England
nothing but part of France or Spain.

824
01:36:13,632 --> 01:36:17,219
From this moment
I am going to follow my own opinion.

825
01:36:17,302 --> 01:36:20,556
Forgive me, Madam,
but you are only a woman.

826
01:36:20,639 --> 01:36:26,812
I may be a woman, Sir William, but
if I choose I have the heart of a man!

827
01:36:29,648 --> 01:36:32,026
I am my father's daughter.

828
01:36:32,860 --> 01:36:35,279
I am not afraid of anything.

829
01:36:36,613 --> 01:36:38,449
I...

830
01:36:40,743 --> 01:36:45,914
I deeply regret, Madam,
if I have caused you such offence

831
01:36:46,707 --> 01:36:51,211
though God knows
all my advice has only ever been

832
01:36:53,839 --> 01:36:56,467
to secure Your Majesty's throne.

833
01:36:56,884 --> 01:36:59,136
And I am grateful for it.

834
01:37:05,267 --> 01:37:09,730
I have decided to create you
Lord Burghley,

835
01:37:09,813 --> 01:37:12,900
so you may enjoy your retirement
in greater ease.

836
01:37:12,983 --> 01:37:17,112
- Madam...
- That will be all, Lord Burghley.

837
01:37:24,536 --> 01:37:25,954
Majesty...

838
01:37:54,400 --> 01:37:56,443
Madam, if I may?

839
01:37:57,736 --> 01:38:01,490
A prince should never flinch
from being blamed

840
01:38:01,573 --> 01:38:07,037
for acts of ruthlessness which are
necessary for safeguarding the State

841
01:38:07,121 --> 01:38:09,164
and their own person.

842
01:38:10,749 --> 01:38:16,213
You must take these things so much
to heart that you do not fear to strike

843
01:38:17,798 --> 01:38:20,884
even the very nearest that you have

844
01:38:22,094 --> 01:38:24,555
if they be implicated.

845
01:38:26,724 --> 01:38:28,767
It has been made known to me

846
01:38:28,851 --> 01:38:33,647
there is a priest abroad in the land,
carrying letters from Rome

847
01:38:33,731 --> 01:38:36,608
to those who mean to harm you.

848
01:38:39,778 --> 01:38:42,865
Norfolk's power in Court is growing.

849
01:38:42,948 --> 01:38:45,617
It is said that he and his foreign allies

850
01:38:45,701 --> 01:38:48,746
are raising an army
to outnumber your own.

851
01:38:48,829 --> 01:38:51,457
If Your Majesty does not act soon

852
01:38:51,540 --> 01:38:53,584
then he will.

853
01:38:56,628 --> 01:39:00,549
Find the priest,
and those who harbour him.

854
01:39:01,842 --> 01:39:05,554
Right, search every room!
You two, upstairs!

855
01:39:16,523 --> 01:39:18,692
Where is Lord Arundel?

856
01:39:22,237 --> 01:39:24,281
He's not here, sir.

857
01:39:34,333 --> 01:39:36,960
Do you know where your father is?

858
01:40:23,590 --> 01:40:26,677
You were carrying letters from the Pope.

859
01:40:26,760 --> 01:40:29,430
To whom were you told to give them?

860
01:40:40,441 --> 01:40:42,484
Tell me,

861
01:40:42,693 --> 01:40:44,945
what is God to you?

862
01:40:47,197 --> 01:40:49,450
Has He abandoned you?

863
01:40:49,992 --> 01:40:55,581
Is He such a worldly God that
He must play at politics and conspiracy?

864
01:40:56,999 --> 01:40:59,251
Is He not divine?

865
01:41:00,669 --> 01:41:05,424
Tell me the truth, as if you were
face to face with Him now.

866
01:41:09,553 --> 01:41:12,014
I am a patient man, Father.

867
01:41:24,777 --> 01:41:26,445
Sussex,

868
01:41:26,528 --> 01:41:28,280
Gardiner,

869
01:41:28,364 --> 01:41:30,115
Arundel.

870
01:41:30,199 --> 01:41:32,868
A man will confess to anything

871
01:41:33,786 --> 01:41:36,121
under torture.

872
01:41:38,999 --> 01:41:42,503
And Lord Robert Dudley,
Earl of Leicester.

873
01:42:01,772 --> 01:42:07,361
Madam, this document was also found
among the priest's possessions.

874
01:42:07,444 --> 01:42:12,366
From His Holiness the Pope
to His Grace the Duke of Norfolk.

875
01:42:15,327 --> 01:42:21,542
"To legitimise your claim to the throne
of England, His Holiness proposes

876
01:42:21,625 --> 01:42:25,921
"Your Grace should take as your bride
Mary, Queen of Scots,

877
01:42:26,005 --> 01:42:28,048
and overthrow Elizabeth..."

878
01:42:28,132 --> 01:42:31,385
The illegitimate and heretical whore

879
01:42:31,468 --> 01:42:34,013
who now sits upon the throne.

880
01:42:34,096 --> 01:42:40,894
All Norfolk need do is sign this paper,
and treason will have been committed.

881
01:42:43,272 --> 01:42:45,733
Then let him sign it.

882
01:42:47,609 --> 01:42:50,070
And let it all be done.

883
01:43:09,840 --> 01:43:11,884
In the future,

884
01:43:12,968 --> 01:43:16,388
when England is safe again and faithful,

885
01:43:16,472 --> 01:43:21,310
they will thank me for this act
and forget the manner of it.

886
01:43:23,103 --> 01:43:25,147
Is it not true?

887
01:43:53,258 --> 01:43:55,844
Deliver this most carefully.

888
01:47:37,983 --> 01:47:40,486
What is the meaning of this?

889
01:47:40,569 --> 01:47:45,240
Your Grace is arrested.
You must go with these men to the Tower.

890
01:47:45,324 --> 01:47:48,243
I must do nothing by your orders.
I am Norfolk.

891
01:47:48,327 --> 01:47:50,204
You were Norfolk.

892
01:47:52,289 --> 01:47:54,750
The dead have no titles.

893
01:48:03,425 --> 01:48:07,179
You were the most powerful man
in England

894
01:48:07,262 --> 01:48:10,474
and could have been greater still

895
01:48:10,557 --> 01:48:13,602
but you had not the courage to be loyal.

896
01:48:15,896 --> 01:48:19,650
Only the conviction of your own vanity.

897
01:48:19,733 --> 01:48:25,114
I think, Walsingham, a man's courage
is in the manner of his death.

898
01:48:26,448 --> 01:48:29,535
I am content to die for my beliefs.

899
01:48:31,203 --> 01:48:33,247
So cut off my head

900
01:48:34,039 --> 01:48:36,500
and make me a martyr.

901
01:48:37,209 --> 01:48:40,295
The people will always remember it.

902
01:48:41,296 --> 01:48:43,132
No...

903
01:48:44,675 --> 01:48:46,927
They will forget.

904
01:48:48,804 --> 01:48:50,848
Your Majesty

905
01:48:51,348 --> 01:48:53,392
knows that

906
01:48:53,517 --> 01:48:56,186
I did it only for my faith.

907
01:48:57,521 --> 01:48:59,565
Nothing more.

908
01:49:02,317 --> 01:49:05,821
All your many kindnesses
are remembered.

909
01:49:13,370 --> 01:49:17,499
You must not think
we care not for your children.

910
01:49:18,834 --> 01:49:22,129
Your Majesty is merciful and forgiving.

911
01:49:41,523 --> 01:49:43,984
What kept you, Walsingham?

912
01:49:45,903 --> 01:49:47,946
I have been waiting.

913
01:50:01,418 --> 01:50:03,462
Your Majesty...

914
01:50:03,545 --> 01:50:06,131
They are all gone to the Tower.

915
01:50:06,215 --> 01:50:08,258
Your friends.

916
01:50:15,224 --> 01:50:17,267
Tell me,

917
01:50:19,770 --> 01:50:22,856
how should I serve thee, Robert?

918
01:50:30,406 --> 01:50:32,658
My course is run.

919
01:50:35,369 --> 01:50:37,830
Just tell me why.

920
01:50:40,249 --> 01:50:42,292
Why?

921
01:50:44,378 --> 01:50:46,422
Madam,

922
01:50:50,342 --> 01:50:53,929
is it not plain enough to you?

923
01:50:56,515 --> 01:50:59,393
It is no easy thing to be loved

924
01:50:59,893 --> 01:51:02,146
by the Queen.

925
01:51:07,359 --> 01:51:10,446
It would corrupt the soul of any man.

926
01:51:13,699 --> 01:51:16,577
Now, for God's sake, kill me.

927
01:51:20,789 --> 01:51:22,833
No...

928
01:51:24,168 --> 01:51:26,879
I think rather to let you live.

929
01:51:26,962 --> 01:51:31,717
Madam, that is not wise.
Lord Robert has committed treason.

930
01:51:31,800 --> 01:51:36,972
- He must be made example of.
- And I will make an example of him.

931
01:51:42,644 --> 01:51:45,105
He shall be kept alive

932
01:51:47,191 --> 01:51:49,651
to always remind me

933
01:51:51,070 --> 01:51:54,156
of how close I came to danger.

934
01:52:55,342 --> 01:52:58,220
I have rid England of her enemies.

935
01:52:59,263 --> 01:53:01,724
What do I do now?

936
01:53:02,016 --> 01:53:04,268
Am I to be made of stone?

937
01:53:06,270 --> 01:53:08,731
Must I be touched by nothing?

938
01:53:08,814 --> 01:53:11,358
Aye, Madam, to reign supreme.

939
01:53:13,444 --> 01:53:19,199
All men need something greater than
themselves to look up to and worship.

940
01:53:28,375 --> 01:53:31,670
They must be able to touch the divine

941
01:53:33,922 --> 01:53:35,966
here on earth.

942
01:53:43,766 --> 01:53:46,852
She had such power over men's hearts.

943
01:53:52,983 --> 01:53:55,235
They died for her.

944
01:53:56,236 --> 01:53:59,531
They have found nothing to replace her.

945
01:55:33,292 --> 01:55:35,919
You will be damned for this!

946
01:55:36,879 --> 01:55:38,714
Tonight I think I die.

947
01:55:39,882 --> 01:55:41,133
Speak up!

948
01:56:22,216 --> 01:56:24,259
Kat...

949
01:56:30,641 --> 01:56:33,310
I have become a virgin.

950
01:57:36,165 --> 01:57:38,625
Observe, Lord Burghley.

951
01:57:41,712 --> 01:57:43,964
I am married

952
01:57:44,381 --> 01:57:46,633
to England.

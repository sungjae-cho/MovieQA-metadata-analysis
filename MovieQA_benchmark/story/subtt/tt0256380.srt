00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:46,315
NURSE: I heard
she was moved to another room.

3
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,431
Mrs. Larson?

4
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:58,479
It...

5
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,075
It won't be much longer,
Mrs. Larson.

00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:09,349
Oh. Well, is he
in a lot of pain?

8
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:11,237
No. No, no.

9
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:15,074
There'll be no more
pain for your husband.
He's heavily sedated.

10
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:21,069
Okay. I think I'm gonna go
send little Hal in now.

11
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:23,799
No. No, no. I don't think
that's such a good idea.

12
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:26,110
With all the painkillers,

13
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,193
the Reverend's
not exactly himself.

14
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:33,909
Look, I think my boy
has a right to say
goodbye to his father.

15
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,436
I mean,
the man means everything
in the world to him.

16
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:44,036
Well, your call.

17
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,679
Nurse?

18
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,951
Yes, Reverend Larson?

19
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:54,031
Did you see the cowboy?

20
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,838
The cowboy?

21
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,755
The cowboy who gave me
the singing nickel
in Pudding Town?

22
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:05,152
Okay, think it's time
to turn down
the morphine drip.

23
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:13,075
Reverend Larson?
Your son is here.

24
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,317
Okay, sure.
Send her in.

25
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,992

26
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:21,071

Dad?

29
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,315
It's me, Dad. Hal.

30
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:51,789
Oh. Glad you're here,
kiddo.

31
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,518
Got a few things
to tell ya.

32
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,511
First, I want you
to promise

33
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:01,433
that no matter
what you do in life,

34
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:04,557
you will never, ever
settle for average.

35
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,633
Yes, sir.

36
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:12,271
Second, don't be satisfied
with routine poontang.

37
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,029
Huh?

38
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,917
Don't do what I did.

39
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:23,480
I married for love,
and your mother Betty
has been a nightmare.

40
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:26,997
But, Dad, Mom's
name is Marian.

41
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,509
Listen to me.
I'm giving you
pearls here.

42
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:36,474
And third, find yourself

43
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,630
a classic beauty

44
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,910
with a perfect can

45
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,675
and great toddies.

46
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:51,069
That will put you
in good stead
with the Lord.

47
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:53,071
It's all in here.

48
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:57,471
Yes, sir.

49
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:03,470
Hot, young tail's
what it's all about.

50
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:07,231
Hot,

51
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:10,790
young tail.

Uncle Larry's

00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:24,432
He seems to be
stuck in the '80s

58
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:32,238
He wears his
Members Only jacket

59
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:40,958
'Cause he thinks
it turns on all the ladies

shake their asses

take it anymore

Can you not hear me
down there?

67
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:38,754
I want nothing
to do with you,
you little warthog.

68
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,068
Shh.

00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,196
You had me
at "Get lost."

Hey, what's up, Mauricio?

71
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:47,749
Hey, Hal.

72
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:48,955
How's the crowd tonight?

73
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,189
Good. I got a few bites.

74
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,840
Yeah? Can I
get you a drink?

75
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,956
I won't say no to that.

76
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,549
Whoo!

77
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,799
Two beers.

Two Buds.

79
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,637
So, I didn't expect
to see you here.

80
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,517
Where's your
new girl Loni?

81
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,192

Lindy.

She's...
Here you go.

83
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:13,990
Actually, I didn't tell her
I was going out tonight.

00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:16,111
Why not? Things
okay with you guys?

85
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,794
Yeah. A little too okay,
if you know
what I'm talking about.

87
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,031
No, I don't know.
What's that mean?

88
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,599
Things are going
in the shitter.

89
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:28,036
Aw, jeez,
I'm sorry to hear that.
Why is she dumping you?

90
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:30,156
She's not.
I'm dumping her.

91
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,309
You're dumping Loni?

92
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,829
Lindy.
Are you crazy?
Lindy's gorgeous.

93
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,958
On the surface,
but when you get
to know her better,

94
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,632
there's a whole
other story goin' on.

95
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,631
Yeah? How goes that?

96
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:45,872
We're sitting there,
you know,
and she's got her bare...

97
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,439
Her bare feet
were on the couch,

98
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,909
and I notice that
her second toe is, like,

99
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,639
half an inch longer
than her big toe.

100
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,556
That's it?
You're breaking up
over that?

101
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,873
Hey, I don't need
that circus shit.

102
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:00,838
Well, couldn't she
get the toe filed
down or something?

103
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,676
What, then
I'm dating a nub?

104
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,835
I'm starting to think
we're jinxed here.

105
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:09,388
Speak for yourself,
my friend.

106
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,674
What, you got
the promotion?

107
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,472
I don't hear about
that till tomorrow.

108
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,314
But guess who is now
officially going out
with Jill.

109
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,595
Jill? Your neighbor Jill?

110
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,591
You're going
out with Jill?

111
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,113
And she doesn't
exactly hate me.

112
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:28,069
Get out!
You are the luckiest
man on the planet.

113
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,193
So what are you
doing here?

114
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,159
She's hostessing
until 11:00.

115
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,759
Actually,
I better get going.

116
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,558
I'll try to catch her
on the way home.

117
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,631
See if she wants
to get a drink.

118
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:40,917
If I know you,
that's not all
she'll be getting.

(LAUGHING)

120
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:43,749
I'll see you later.

121
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:45,954
I said no.

122
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,996
No? Why not?

123
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,355
I don't want
to have a drink.
I want to go home.

124
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,589
Is that so hard
to understand?

125
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,557
Hey, hey, hey.

126
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,949
What's goin' on?
Are you mad?

127
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:58,952
No, I'm not mad.
I just...

128
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,917
Go on, say it.
You know what?

129
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,560
No matter what it is,
we're gonna work it out.

130
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:07,957
Hal, I'm not
attracted to you.

131
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,950
So what?
You think everyone
who goes out

132
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,632
is attracted
to each other?
Get real.

133
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:17,197
I think they're attracted
to each other
in the beginning.

134
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:20,955
Oh, come on.
That sounds like a bunch
of New Age hooey.

135
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,469
All right, maybe
for some people

136
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,915
there's a little spark
in the beginning,
but for most,

137
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,675
the attraction part
happens way later.
Whoa!

138
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:34,156
Just like that,
we're breaking up?

139
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:38,355
Well,
we were never going out.
We just had one date.

140
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,629
Come on. Hey, let's stay
together five days.
That's all I need.

141
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,312
Why do you need
five days?

142
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,960
Because tomorrow,
I'll finally
get my promotion.

143
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:50,794
There's gonna be parties,
dinners, this, that.
Come on, I need you now.

144
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:54,077
You don't need me.
You'll be so busy,
you won't think about me.

145
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,752
How can I not
think about you?

146
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,273
You live right
across the hall.

147
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,471
I don't know, Hal.
Maybe... Maybe you should
think about moving.

148
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,396
Hal, we've made
a decision regarding
that wholesaler position.

149
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,713
Yes! It's about
time, Dave.

150
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:28,157
We decided to go with
the gal from Merrill.

151
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:31,630
She's a proven entity.
A big producer.

152
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,235
I'm sorry, man.

153
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:40,152
No, it's...
The gal's a proven entity.
What the heck you gonna do?

154
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:46,233
Hal, I'm so sorry.
Yeah, thanks.

155
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,550
You should have gotten it.
You deserved it.

156
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:51,996
No, I didn't.
Obviously I didn't put
them in a position

157
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:55,436
where they
had to promote me.
It's a good lesson.

158
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:58,273
Make yourself
indispensable,
that's the key.

159
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:01,955
And to make matters worse,
Jill dumped me last night.

160
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:05,430
Dumped you?
Don't you have to be
going out to get dumped?

161
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:07,835
What does that mean?

162
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,797
I just thought
it was more of a...

163
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,757
Anyway, I don't see
why you care so much.

164
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,478
You know she was
wrong for you.

165
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,196
How can you say that?
She was perfect.

166
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:20,269
When are you gonna get it?
They're just well-formed
molecules.

167
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:22,920
By the way, her tits
weren't even real.

168
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,117
Well, I could squeeze 'em.
That's real enough for me.

169
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,758
Hal, I don't
understand how a guy

170
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:35,597
who's as nice, and loyal,
and generous as you could
have such a huge flaw.

171
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,679
What are you talking about?

172
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:42,715
You don't think picking girls
solely on their looks
may not be the best way?

173
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:46,156
What, am I supposed
to apologize for
having high standards?

174
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,800
High standards?
In the five years
I've known you,

175
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,599
every woman,
I should say girl,
you've gone after

176
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:52,999
has been completely
out of your league.

177
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,639
What's that
supposed to mean?

178
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,871
Oh, she doesn't
mean anything by it.

179
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:00,872
She's just saying
you're not
that good-looking.

180
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:04,552
Oh!
I thought she was implying
something really mean.

181
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,596
No.

182
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:31,116
Hey, it's you.
You're the TV guru guy.

183
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,758
Tony Robbins.
Pleased to meet you.

184
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:35,195
Yeah! Oh, man!

185
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:38,477
So, wow! You gave advice
to whatchamacallit.

186
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:41,114
President Clinton?
Mandela?
No, no, no.

187
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,269
Gorbachev?

188
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,588
No, no. Pamela Anderson.

189
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:47,593
Right? Yeah! Give me
another handshake.

190
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,069
Wow! Man,
look at those mitts!

191
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,230
That's like grabbing
a bunch of bananas.

192
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,470
And what's up
with those dogs?
How big are those?

193
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:55,629
Size 16, buddy.

194
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:56,994
Holy cannoli.

195
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:59,389
You must do pretty
good with the ladies.

196
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,708
Just one.

197
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,432
Really?
Yeah.

198
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:04,556
(SNICKERS)

199
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:06,232
She sounds hot!

200
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,199
She is an amazing lady.

201
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,633
I bet.

202
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,392
So, what are you
doing in my town?

203
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:14,397
We're doing
a seminar here.

204
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:18,832
I help people deal with
life's challenges with more
dignity and more courage.

205
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:21,912
That's my deal,
is the courage.
I try to...

206
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,594
Hang on a second.
Are we gonna fall?

207
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:26,796
No, it just stopped.
That's weird.

208
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:29,229
Oh, man, yeah.
So what do we...
Hang on.

209
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,639
Are you okay?
I'm fine.

210
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,789
You okay?

211
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:34,872
Yeah, yeah. It's just,
I feel a little lightheaded.

212
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:42,678
Then she dumped me.
Flat out.

213
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,155
Not even the courtesy
of a severance pop.

214
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,832
A severance pop?

215
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:48,717
You know, one last...

216
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:49,835
(WHISTLES)

217
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:50,875
To ease the pain.

218
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:53,918
The nice ones'll
sometimes throw you that.

219
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,514
It sounds like you've had
some odd relationships.

220
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,635
Yeah.

221
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:00,109
See, the problem is
I'm kinda picky.

222
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,838
What do you mean, picky?

223
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:06,357
Well, for instance,
I like 'em real young.

224
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:10,274
Like, did you ever see
Paulina in her first
Sports Illustrated layout?

225
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:12,316
You want a young
Paulina type?

226
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,755
Well, that face, but
with better headlights.

227
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:18,355
You know how hers have
kind of dimmed lately?

228
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:21,034
Heidi Klum's
beams would do.
And her teeth.

229
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:24,430
Or that Britney Spears girl.
She's got great knockers.

230
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:26,875
But she's a tad muscular.

231
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:31,351
Actually, you know what?
Her ass would do, too,
if she had a better grill.

232
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,432
Like Michelle Pfeiffer
back when she did Grease 2.

233
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:37,996
But she'd have to
be a little smilier
than Michelle.

234
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:41,072
Like Rebecca Romijn-Stamos,
before she got Stamosed.

235
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,238
But not as skinny.
Someone a little
meatier, like Heidi.

236
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,555
But no accent.
You know those accents...

237
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:48,631
Yah-yah-yah-yah.

238
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,709
They really get old fast.

239
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,597
You know what I mean.
Someone like that.

240
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:56,910
Don't you think
you're being a bit shallow in
the way you look at women?

241
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,319
Well, no.

242
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:03,109
I mean, you know,
I'd like her to be into
culture and shit, too.

243
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:06,554
Okay, hypothetical situation.

244
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:11,191
Which do you prefer,
a girlfriend missing
one breast or half a brain?

245
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,794
Ooh, toughie.

246
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,034
That's a toughie.

247
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,917
How's the remaining
breast? Is it big?

248
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,796
What's your relationship
like with your parents?

249
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:25,079
Oh, it's excellent. I mean,
my mom's hilarious.
She golfs every afternoon.

250
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:27,037
Actually,
I don't really
remember my dad.

251
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,395
He died when
I was nine, so...

252
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:32,153
If you were nine,
that's kind of odd.
You should remember a lot.

253
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,151
Yeah, but I don't.

254
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:38,199
My mom thinks I might have
been a little traumatized
by the whole thing.

255
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:41,875
Anyway, all I remember
is he was great.

256
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,276
He was a great guy,
and I really
loved him. But...

257
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,798
I'm sorry you lost him.

258
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:50,189
Hey, listen, I know
you got a great heart.

259
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:52,589
You're just a bit fixated
on people's appearances.

260
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,280
So, Hal Larson,
I'm gonna do you
a great favor.

261
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,759
Really?
Yeah.

262
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:59,308
Listen, this is
how it'll work.
From this moment on,

263
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,277
whenever you meet
someone in the future,

264
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,749
you're only gonna see
what's inside them.

265
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,478
So you'll respond
to that.

266
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:08,677
Because that, my friend,
is where the true beauty lies.

267
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,998
Okay, Tony, I think
you're getting
a little cabin fever.

268
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:14,833
Hold on.
What if I told you

269
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:17,718
you could have
the most beautiful
women in the world?

270
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,315
Uh, is this kind of like
what you do in your seminars?

271
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,992
No, no,
this is very special.

272
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,798
This is just
between you and me.

273
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:27,595
Let's get up, and
I'll show you what to do.
Yeah!

274
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:31,593
Now, you got a pattern
of looking at women and
judging them by the exterior.

275
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,910
We gotta break
that pattern.
All right.

276
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,913
So has there been a time
when you were especially
shallow?

277
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,991
You saw a woman,
thought you were
better than she was?

278
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,672
All the time.
All the time.

279
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,830
Can you think of a time
when you were really shallow?

280
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,831
Oh, yeah, I got one.

281
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,239
Think about that. Ready?

282
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,555
Devils, come out!

283
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:51,517
What the hell are you
doin', banana hands?

284
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,079
Just hang on.

285
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,673
We gotta jolt
your nervous system.

286
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,193
Oh, yeah. I'm sorry.

287
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:58,874
Not just talk about it.
Here's what I want you to do.

288
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,678
Just relax.
All right.

289
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:02,034
And I won't
do that again.

290
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,792
I didn't mean
the "banana hands" thing.

291
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:04,869
That's okay.

292
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:10,199
Close your eyes. Just relax.
And I want you to imagine
that you're on a beach.

293
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:13,989
It's a warm day,
and the sun is
just starting to set.

294
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:19,154
And you're looking in
the eyes of a woman,
and you're feeling her heart.

295
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:21,595
You're seeing her soul.

296
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:25,229
You're feeling her spirit.

297
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:27,151
That's it.

298
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:29,993
That's it. Excellent.

299
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,308
Excellent.

300
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,312
Taxi!

301
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:43,549
Oh.

302
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,920
I'm sorry. I...
I thought that...

303
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,355
No, no, no. No.
It's my fault.
I didn't see you.

304
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:53,637
This is your cab.
No, I'm gonna get
the next cab.

305
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:54,875
Uh...

306
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:58,156
Okay.
All right.

307
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:04,076
Look, I'm just...
I'm just headed
over to the East Side.

308
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:06,873
Do you want to share, or...

309
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,029
Yeah!

310
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,997
Yeah, let's take this one.

311
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:13,470
So, awesome.
Thank you. Terrific.

312
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:15,914
Where to, my friends?

313
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,592
East Side Plaza
for me, please.

314
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,954
Likewise.

315
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:38,108
What?
Oh. Huh?
Sorry. I just...

316
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:42,879
I mean, yeah, you're...
You're really pretty.

317
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:47,314
(SCOFFS) Yeah, right.

318
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:50,198
Jeez, is everybody in
this city so flattering?

319
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,634
See, I figured you weren't
from around here.
Where you from?

320
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:54,709
Boston.

321
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,355
Beantown.

322
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,878
The musical fruit.

323
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:03,117
The more you eat,
the more you toot.

324
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:09,069
So, you here on
a shoot or something?

325
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,388
A shoot?

326
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,550
I mean, you must be
a model, right?

327
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,478
My grandmother's
not doing so well,

328
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:26,199
so I took a year off
from school to help her out.

329
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:29,158
Oh. Helping granny.
Cool.

330
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,152
Thanks.
Yeah.

331
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,919
Bye.

332
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,831
So, nice catching up.

333
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,279
Listen,

334
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:59,595
I know you'll probably
think I'm some kind
of wacko for asking, but...

335
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:00,954
What?

336
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:05,396
Well, while
you're here in town,
I mean, you know...

337
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:11,352
If you ever feel like taking
a break from hanging out
with your old, sick granny,

338
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:12,833
you know, we could...

339
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:15,439
Sure. I mean...

340

Really?

341
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:19,833
Are you kidding?
Yeah! That'd be...

342
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:22,115
I would absolutely
love to, if...

343
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:25,073
Okay, yeah. I should
get your number, then.

344
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,714
No, no. I'll get yours,
because it would...

345
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,836
With my luck,
you'll lose mine, so...

346

Oh. No, I get it.
Very funny.

347
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:35,194
You got me.
That was...
No, that was good.

but you went the extra mile.

I thought you meant...
Never mind.

where he makes it so I can
score better with the ladies.

At the time I thought
it was sort of a joke.

But this afternoon,
the first beautiful woman
I saw went for me.

368
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:40,948
Could be coincidence.

369
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:44,476
But no.
This wasn't, you know...
This was different.

370

I don't know,
she went crazy
for me or something.

I think talking to him
helped my confidence
or something.

more confident.

No. Why would I?

And it took me like ages

431

Just to understand
that I was afraid
to be a simple guy

like a crowd dancing

live without the things

00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:39,352
Peace Corps.

512
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,668
Peace Corps. Wow.

513
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:43,399
That's very altrudocious
of you.

514
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:45,789
Altrudocious?
That's not a word.

515
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:50,670
Ah, you mean
humanidocious, right?

516
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:52,354
(CHUCKLES)

517
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:53,634
Yeah. That's the one.

518
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:56,359
All right.
Ready to order?

519
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:01,793
Yeah. Can I get
a double pizza burger,

520
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:05,714
chili fries with cheese,
and a large chocolate
milkshake?

521
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:12,190
Nicely done. I'll have
the exact same thing.

522
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:13,838
You got it.

523
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,357
I am impressed.

524
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:18,556
It's nice to see
a girl order
a real meal.

525
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:21,677
I can't stand it when
you guys order a glass
of water and a crouton.

526
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,478
It ruins the whole
point of going out.

527
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:27,155
Yeah, well, that's probably
what I should be ordering,
you know?

528
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:30,437
But I don't know,
no matter what I eat,

529
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:32,397
my weight just seems
to stay the same.

530
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,994
So I just figure,
what the hell?
I'm gonna eat what I want.

531
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:38,277
Oh, totally. If you can
get away with it,
more power to ya.

532
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:43,232
Don't be a smart-ass.

533
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:47,036
What? No,
I'm just saying,
you know.

534
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:50,556
I feel bad for people
who count calories.
It's no way to live.

535
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:52,832
Yeah.

536
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:55,798
But in return they get to
be a lot thinner than I am.

537
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:58,954
Uh...

538
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:00,553
Are you out of your mind?

539
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:03,234
What do you weigh?
110, 115 pounds?

540
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:08,632
Which one of my butt cheeks
are you talking about?

541
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,199
Okay.

542
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:14,192
Cuckoo, cuckoo.

543
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:16,555
Trust me, whatever
you're doing,
it's working.

544
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:17,868
It is working.

545
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,518
Oh, go on.

546
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:22,194
Oh, my God!
Are you okay?

547
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:25,154
Oops.

548
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:30,193
Goddang it.
Rosemary, don't move.
Is your back all right?

549
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:31,269
Yeah.

550
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:32,759
Is she all right?

551
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:35,354
Listen, you gotta get
some decent chairs
in here, man.

552
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:38,432
What's this shit
made out of, anyway?

553
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:40,795
Steel.

554
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:46,159
Yeah? Well, you should
get it welded better
in the corners!

555
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:47,709
All right, then.

556
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,398
Rosemary, you sure
you're okay?

557
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:53,109
Yeah. I'm a little
embarrassed but

558
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,031
it's happened before,
it'll happen again.

559
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,348
Oh, man.

560
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:02,236
Don't be embarrassed.
Listen, I beef it.
Everybody beefs it.

561
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:05,357
We're too late.
The food's
probably all gone.

562
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:12,557
Listen, can you wait
here one second?

563
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:15,029
Oh, Hal,
just let it go.

564
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:17,310
Nah. Nah.

565
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:19,675
Hal.
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.

566
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,997
(MOCK LAUGHTER)

567
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:26,512
You guys are making
fun of me 'cause
I'm a little pudgy?

568
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:29,669
No, I wasn't making
fun of you. I was...
That's fine.

569
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:31,631
Do me a favor.
Take a look outside.

570
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:34,270
You see that little
fox out there?

571
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:37,193
See that little number?
She's with me.

572
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:40,272
If you took all the women
you two have
ever gone out with,

573
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:42,191
they wouldn't
equal one of her.

574
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:45,031
We're not arguing that.
No.

575
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:47,868
(MOCK LAUGHTER)

576
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:49,951
That's right.
Laugh it up, fellas.

577
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:54,750
And tonight, when you're
hugging your pillow,
remember, I'm with her.

578
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:57,035
All right? That's it.

579
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:58,789
Uh!

580
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,832
What happened?
Well, let's just say

581
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:07,236
the score's Hal two,
mall rats zero.

582
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:09,709
Let me walk you to your car.

583
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,628
Well, thanks for lunch, Hal.

584
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:16,718
Ah, my pleasure, Rosie.

585
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,392
My mother calls me Rosie.

586
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,471
Really?
Yeah.

587
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:24,991
Gentlemen, can I
interest you in some chili
fries and half a burger?

588
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:28,993
There's a lot left
'cause the little guy
couldn't finish his meal.

589
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:31,310
Hey. Hey.
Pussy.

590
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:34,555
That was nice of you.

591
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,870
Well, you're all right
in my book, too, Hal.

592
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,359
Can I have your number?

593
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:39,668
What number?

594
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:42,194
Your PIN number,
I want your money!

595
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:45,192
Your phone number.
What do you think?

596
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:46,429
Why?

597
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:50,991
You know, to go out.
Maybe like tomorrow.

598
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:58,789
Uh...

599
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:01,592
Well, yeah.

600
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:07,032
I mean, sure.
It's in the book under
Rosemary Shanahan.

601
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:08,678
I can write it down.
It's S-H-A...

602
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:10,432
No, I'll remember it.

603
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:12,715
My boss's name
is Steve Shanahan.

604
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,028
That's my father's name.

605
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:16,680
Not JPS Steve Shanahan?

606
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:18,671
Yeah!

607
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:19,795
Yeah.

608
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:21,472
Your father is my boss.

609
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:24,120
I mean, not my boss.
He's my boss's boss.

610
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:27,829
I mean, I don't know him,
but I see him
around the office.

611
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:32,192
Well, then you won't
forget my name.

612
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,958
Hal?
Yeah?

613
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:52,516
If I don't hear from you,

614
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:55,756
I appreciate everything,
anyway.

615
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,313
Cuckoo.

616
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:07,750
You sure you don't
want a dog?

617
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:11,276
Yeah, yeah.
I'm trying to lose
a couple of lbs.

618
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:13,112
Since when do you
care about your gut?

619
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:17,273
I don't really, but
I'm a little nervous.

620
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:21,035
This girl who's coming
to meet me here
is in incredible.

621
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:22,189
Uh-huh?

622
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:24,271
Like the ones
on the dance floor
the other night?

623
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:28,672
Even better, buddy.
I'm telling you,
it's almost beyond belief.

624
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:33,959
She's funny, she's smart,
she teaches self-esteem
to sick kids.

625
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:35,996
And I would never
believe a girl as
beautiful could have

626
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:38,071
such a great personality.

627
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:42,312
Ugly duckling syndrome.
She probably wasn't
pretty till high school.

628
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:45,790
The personality
had to develop
out of necessity.

629
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,632
You know what?
I bet you're right.

630
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:50,029
She's way too pretty
to be so nice.

631
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:51,519
Sometimes they're
ugly so long,

632
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:53,795
they turn pretty
and don't realize it.

633
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:57,913
The ugly self-image
is so well ingrained.
That's a real find.

634
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,672
Hey!
Hey!

635
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:01,788
I've been looking for you.

636
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:06,316
Oh, shit. Oh, it's Lindy.
The girl with the toe.

637
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:09,231
Hey, Mauricio.
How ya doing?

638
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:11,390
Good. Did you
get my message?

639
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:16,917
No, no. My phone machine's
not really working there.
Did you call?

640
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:20,231
I got tickets for
that Beatles reunion.

641
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,355
The Beatles?

642
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,476
Yeah. Well, not
the real Beatles,

643
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:25,437
but Paul, George and
Ringo will be there.

644
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:27,670
But Eric Clapton is
filling in for John.

645
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:30,151
It's an invitation-only
acoustic set.

646
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:32,071
Only about 70 people, tops.

647
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:33,195
Oh, man.

648
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:34,429
So you're in?

649
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:36,553
Ahhh...

650
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,275
No. Not a Clapton fan.

651
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:44,998
Think I'll pass.

652
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,474
Okay.

653
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:51,836
Well, I guess
I'll see ya.
Yeah, yeah.

654
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:53,558
Bye, Lindy.

655
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:55,915
Oh, did you
see the toe?

656
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,549
Mauricio,
I gotta tell you,
you got issues.

657
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:00,709
Don't even get me started.

658
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:03,758
Oh, God. There she is.
There's Rosemary.

659
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,354
Where?

660
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:09,078
Right there.

661
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:10,115
Right where?

662
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:12,236
Straight ahead.
Across the field.

663
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,629
Is she behind the rhino?

664
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:16,711
She's right there!

665
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:25,872
Mauricio, I want you
to meet someone.

666
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:29,999
This is Rosemary Shanahan.
Rosemary, Mauricio Wilson.

667
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:32,640
Hi. Nice to meet you.

668
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:36,872
Holy cow. I mean, hi.

669
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:42,069
Is that a Members Only
jacket?

670
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:43,839
Yes. Yes, it is.

671
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,956
So, are you, like,
the last member?

672
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:48,156
(LAUGHS)

673
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:52,395
Oh, man.
One-nothing, Rosemary.
I told you she was good.

674
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:57,076
Excuse me
for just one second.
Hello? Oh, hi, Mom.

675
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:00,514
Yeah, hold on.
Will you guys excuse me?

676
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:02,511
Want something
from the snack bar?

677
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:05,956
Yeah, get me
a beer and nachos with
all the stuff on it.

678
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:07,393
You got it.

679
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,278
Does she take
the cake or what?

680
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:13,874
She takes
the whole bakery, Hal.

681
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:14,995
I told you.

682
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:18,197
Yes, you did. And yet
I wasn't prepared.

I like the track.

the way your friend

gonna shoot me with

really weird lately.

804
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:50,359
do me a favor and stop
saying that I'm pretty,
and that I'm not fat, okay?

a lot of friends who are
boys, and no boyfriends.

And I never will be.

And I'm fine with that.
You know?

around saying that I'm
something that I'm not,

813

it's just,
it's not nice.

You're starting
to scare me.

I mean,
I really like you,

a little nutty if you really
believe you're not beautiful.

good to be true.

to be a total psycho.

Her self-image is
so far off, it's scary.

Well, maybe you had a little
something to do with that.

824
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:10,592
What? What are you
talking about?

825
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:14,070
All I ever did was tell her
how perfect she was.

826
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:16,276
Really?
Yeah.

827
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:18,675
Then she got all huffy
and told me to grow up.

828
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:22,476
Well,
that's probably good advice.
You are kind of immature.

829
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:27,914
You're not serious.
You actually think
you're more mature than me?

830
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:32,198
Yeah, right. I'm probably
more immature than you,

831
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:34,999
but at least I have
a bigger willie.

than a mouse's.

bigger than...

I heard,

836
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:53,790
but it took you,
like, eight seconds.

837
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:56,075
You can't make a comeback
after eight seconds.

838
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:59,470
You got three seconds.
Five, tops.

839
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:03,030
That's why they call it
a quip. Not a slowp.

anything better to read?

to apologize
for last night.

to apologize.

Yeah, I do.

00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,798
You gotta get in here
and look at this turd.

851
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:46,394
It looks just like
Klinger from M*A*S*H.

852
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:48,389
Um...

853
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:53,274
Why don't we
get out of here?
Okay.

854
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:54,793
Coffee?

855
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:58,990
(BABY, NOW THAT
I'VE FOUND YOU PLAYING)

856
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:00,638
Mmm.

857
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:06,991
Excuse me. Are you
ready to order?

858
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:09,674
Yes. Two double
cheeseburgers, bacon,
one with relish.

859
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:11,478
Thank you.

860
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:14,880
(SLURPING)

861
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:16,349
Ow.

862
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:18,109
Are you okay?

863
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:19,428
Brain freeze.

864
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:24,709
Baby,
now that I've found you
I can't let you go

865
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:29,278
I'll build my
world around you,
I need you so

866
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:33,510
Excuse me, sweetie.
Professional.

867
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:42,590
Baby, baby,
since first we met...

868
00:47:42,680 --> 00:47:44,830
Hey, Billy, stay over
near the ladder.

869
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:48,757
Weak. So weak.

870
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:51,718
You wanna see a splash?
I'm gonna show you a splash.
Ready?

871
00:47:56,360 --> 00:47:59,830
You spend a lifetime
looking for somebody

872
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:02,994
To give me love like you

873
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:07,870
Now you've told me
that you wanna leave me

874
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:11,919
Darling, I just
can't let you

875
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:16,710
Baby,
now that I've found you
I can't let you go...

876
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:18,472
That was good?

877
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:19,709
Billy?

878
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:23,232
Billy? Billy? Billy!

879
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:25,639
(SOBBING) Daddy.

880
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:30,149
Sorry.

881
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:33,677
Now that I've found you
I can't let you go

882
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:37,833
I'll build my
world around you,
I need you so

883
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:41,669
Baby, even though
you don't need me

884
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:44,558
You don't need me

885
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:47,708
What's the matter?

886
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:50,439
I should have
changed at the beach.

887
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:53,432
What? Are you crazy?
You look great.

888
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:56,318
I don't normally
dress like this
around my parents.

889
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:57,879
Hey, hey, come on.

890
00:48:57,960 --> 00:49:01,191
I'm the one who should be
nervous here, not you.

891
00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:08,189
Hey, you know,
I've been meaning to ask
you, were you adopted?

892
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:10,758
No. Why?

893
00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:13,914
'Cause your dad
has that weird accent.

894
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,958
And also, I've seen him
around the office.

895
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:19,110
I gotta say, I don't see
the slightest resemblance.

896
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:20,349
Really?
Yeah.

897
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:23,591
Everybody says
if you put a wig on him,
he'd look just like me.

898
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:27,670
(IRISH ACCENT)
Would you look at
who's here now?

899
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:29,034
Come here, my darlin'.

900
00:49:29,120 --> 00:49:30,599
Hi, Daddy.

901
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:32,155
Rosie, honey.

902
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:33,508
Mom.

903
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:35,636
Good to see ya.

904
00:49:35,720 --> 00:49:38,473
Hal Larson, the guy
I was telling you about.

905
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:39,959
It's great to
meet you, sir.

906
00:49:40,080 --> 00:49:41,672
Likewise.

907
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:43,079
Nice to meet you, Hal.

908
00:49:43,160 --> 00:49:45,230
The pleasure is mine,
Mrs. Shanahan.

909
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:49,074
Wow, I can see where
Rosemary gets her figure.

910
00:49:56,720 --> 00:50:00,429
What the hell...
What the hell is
that you've got on?

911
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:04,477
We were at the beach.

912
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:07,711
Won't you be putting
something else on, darlin'?

913
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:12,793
Oh, come on. She doesn't
have to do that for me.
Let's just keep it casual.

914
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:15,073
Casual.

915
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:21,356
Hey, Dad, Hal's one of your
great untapped resources
down at the company.

916
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:23,670
Why don't you tell him
some of your ideas?

917
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:26,752
Oh, so you've got
a few ideas, do ya?

918
00:50:27,640 --> 00:50:29,756
HAL: It is risky, but
the rewards are greater, too.

919
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:33,839
The point is, only
a company with a solid
reputation like JPS

920
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:35,558
could ever market
this product.

921
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:40,155
MRS. SHANAHAN:
Hal, let me take your plate.

922
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:42,549
Oh, thank you.
It was delicious.

923
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:44,710
Can I get you boys
some coffee?

924
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:47,155
I'd love a cup
of tea, darlin'.

925
00:50:47,240 --> 00:50:49,390
Maybe just a drop
of the hard stuff.

926
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:54,195
Yeah,
I'll just have a cup of joe.
That'd be great. Thanks.

927
00:50:55,560 --> 00:50:59,758
I have to say, Hal,
I'm impressed with
a lot of your ideas.

928
00:50:59,840 --> 00:51:01,956
Some of them are
dog shit, you know,

929
00:51:02,040 --> 00:51:05,271
but for the most part,
you seem to have done
your homework.

930
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:07,715
So I'd like you to do
something for me.
Okay.

931
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:11,998
Well, I'm meeting with me
executive committee
Monday morning,

932
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:14,435
and I'd like you to
make a presentation.

933
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:17,033
Seriously?

934
00:51:17,120 --> 00:51:19,236
Well, nothing fancy,
you understand.

935
00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:23,029
Just talk about the same
things that you talked
about here tonight.

936
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:24,599
Great. I'd love to.

937
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:27,031
Oh, and by the way,

938
00:51:28,080 --> 00:51:30,150
you can cut out
the act now.

939
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:31,229
Excuse me?

940
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:35,393
You think
I got as far as I did in
me life by bein' a fool?

941
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:39,232
Now, you've got ambition,
Hal, and I admire that.

942
00:51:39,320 --> 00:51:42,437
Hell, I wish
I had a hundred more
like yourself.

943
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:44,476
We'd be the number-one firm
in the country.

944
00:51:44,560 --> 00:51:47,358
And me daughter would get
a hell of a lot more dates.

945
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:52,157
I'm sure Rosemary
doesn't have any
problem getting dates.

946
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:55,198
I told you to cut
the shit out, all right?

947
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:58,078
Look, Rosemary
is me daughter,

948
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:00,276
and God knows
I love her dearly.

949
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:06,275
But I think we both know
that we won't soon be
seeing her twirlin' the baton,

950
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:08,954
marching along
with the Dallas
Cheerleaders.

951
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:15,949
Uh...

952
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:18,711
I don't understand.

953
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:22,632
I'm telling you
the truth, Hal.

954
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:27,278
And the truth is I haven't
been able to bounce me
daughter on me knee

955
00:52:27,360 --> 00:52:29,351
since she was two.

956
00:52:31,240 --> 00:52:34,277
You know, I've read
about people like you.

957
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:36,154
People like me?

958
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:39,312
You superachievers
with your impossible
standards.

959
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:42,472
Nothing's ever good enough.
Nothing measures up.

960
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:47,156
It never occurs to you
that your kids are people,
with their own feelings.

961
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:48,639
You think they're just
an extension of you,

962
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:50,517
like your billion-dollar
company,

963
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:54,878
or your $20 million
Lear Jet and your Picasso
out in the front hall.

964
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:59,272
Everything reflects on you,
so nothing and no one
is ever good enough.

965
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:02,239
Go on.

966
00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:04,994
When I first met Rosemary,

967
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:07,640
she told me she knew
she wasn't that good-looking.

968
00:53:07,720 --> 00:53:09,597
I could not
believe my ears.

969
00:53:10,040 --> 00:53:12,315
How can a person
this beautiful

970
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:17,520
possibly interpret what
she sees in the mirror to
be anything other than that?

971
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:19,556
Well, now I know.

972
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:27,028
Is everything okay?

973
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:30,599
Huh? Yeah,
everything is fine.

974
00:53:30,680 --> 00:53:32,159
Just fine.

975
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:41,959
What?

976
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:47,997
Nothing. I just can't
believe how lucky I am.

977
00:53:51,160 --> 00:53:52,912
(THIS IS MY WORLD PLAYING)

978
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:57,556
You swear to God
you're not gonna laugh?

979
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:00,392
Come on,
I'm not gonna laugh.

980
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:02,389
(WHIMPERS)

981
00:54:04,360 --> 00:54:05,588
(EXHALES DEEPLY)

982
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:10,715
Ah.

983
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:12,313
Daddy like.

984
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:16,959
The look on your face

985
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:23,428
It can never
explain your heart

986
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:28,994
And the touch of my lips

987
00:54:29,840 --> 00:54:35,472
It can never
tell you my thoughts

988
00:54:35,560 --> 00:54:39,951
Then you want me to change

989
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:44,916
I can't get used to...

990
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:47,711
What in...
How did...

991
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:49,672
(LAUGHS)

992
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:55,715
Get over here, Houdini.

993
00:54:56,400 --> 00:55:00,791
'Cause it's not really me
This is my world

994
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:05,317
This is who I am
And I'm not gonna give up...

995
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:07,311
Hi.

996
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:09,550
Yes, I am.

997
00:55:12,040 --> 00:55:14,474
Everything's so perfect.

998
00:55:14,560 --> 00:55:16,357
It's a little scary.

999
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:17,589
I know.

1000
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,991
But in a good way.

1001
00:55:22,080 --> 00:55:25,038
To have so much to lose.
That's nice.

1002
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:36,075
I'm gonna call you later.

1003
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:37,639
Okay.

1004
00:55:37,720 --> 00:55:39,278
Bye.

1005
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:44,959
(SIGHS)

1006
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:52,432
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

1007
00:55:54,040 --> 00:55:55,678
Forget something?

1008
00:55:57,040 --> 00:55:59,031
Oh, hey.
Hi. I'm glad I caught you

1009
00:55:59,120 --> 00:56:01,509
before you went to work.
What's up?

1010
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:04,558
I was wondering
if maybe you wanted
to come over tonight.

1011
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:07,108
Open a bottle of wine,
maybe watch a video.

1012
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:08,668
Uh...

1013
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:10,358
Nah. Thanks, though.

1014
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:18,994
And in summation,
I feel that these measures

1015
00:56:19,080 --> 00:56:21,833
will help JPS and
all of our customers.

1016
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:30,950
Nice job, Hal.
Thank you.

1017
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:33,393
Nicely done.
I appreciate it.

1018
00:56:33,480 --> 00:56:35,152
Hal, I stand corrected.

1019
00:56:35,240 --> 00:56:36,878
Thank you.

1020
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:40,509
Hal, I need to see you
in me office straight away.

1021
00:56:40,600 --> 00:56:41,999
Sure.

1022
00:56:43,120 --> 00:56:44,917
Sit yourself down.

1023
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:50,316
So, what'd you think?

1024
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:53,713
I'll be gettin' to
that in a minute.

1025
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:57,349
I want to talk to you about
that little conversation
we had the other night

1026
00:56:57,440 --> 00:57:00,273
and all of them things
you said to me.

1027
00:57:01,160 --> 00:57:05,517
Well, I'm more than just
a little embarrassed,
having said what I said.

1028
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:09,239
I think me daughter
is lucky to have you.

1029
00:57:10,040 --> 00:57:13,032
No, sir.
I'm the lucky one.

1030
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:15,512
Indeed.

1031
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:19,718
Well, now, as to
your meeting in there.

1032
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:21,518
Sure, it was first-rate.

1033
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:23,996
Yeah?
Oh, yes.

1034
00:57:24,080 --> 00:57:27,117
Hal, I'm gonna
level with ya.

1035
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:28,713
I need your balls.

1036
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:30,235
Sir?

1037
00:57:30,320 --> 00:57:34,029
I need a man around
that can give it to me
straight, you know?

1038
00:57:34,120 --> 00:57:37,715
Whether the news
be good or bad.

1039
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:39,631
So I've decided.

1040
00:57:39,720 --> 00:57:43,554
From now on, you'll be
working directly for me.

1041
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:46,632
Uh...

1042
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:48,995
I don't know
what to say but...

1043
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:51,435
Thank you.

1044
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:55,115
Well, a thank you
will do just fine.

1045
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,309
Well, get the fuck out.

1046
00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:02,435
Oh, okay.

1047
00:58:09,120 --> 00:58:12,317
BOTH: Congratulations
on your promotion!

1048
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:13,389
Oh, sorry.

1049
00:58:13,480 --> 00:58:16,438
No, no. Come in, come in.
I want you to meet Rosemary.

1050
00:58:16,520 --> 00:58:18,636
Rosemary, this is
Jen and Artie.
Hi.

1051
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:21,439
Kids, Rosemary Shanahan.

1052
00:58:21,560 --> 00:58:23,437
As in Steve?

1053
00:58:23,560 --> 00:58:28,190
Yeah, he's my dad.
Oh, God, which reminds me,
I gotta meet him for lunch.

1054
00:58:28,280 --> 00:58:30,840
I'll see you this
weekend, okay?

1055
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:32,189
Mmm. (GOBBLING)

1056
00:58:32,320 --> 00:58:34,276
(ROSEMARY GIGGLES)

1057
00:58:34,360 --> 00:58:35,998
It was really nice
to meet you guys.

1058
00:58:36,080 --> 00:58:37,559
Mind if I take
a little sliver?

1059
00:58:37,640 --> 00:58:39,073
Go for it.

1060
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:47,271
Beauty.

1061
00:58:47,360 --> 00:58:49,157
Want a plate?

1062
00:58:49,240 --> 00:58:50,559
Uh-uh.

1063
00:58:51,840 --> 00:58:54,912
I know what you're thinking.
Where does she put it, right?

1064
00:58:55,640 --> 00:58:59,838
You guys, thanks for the cake.
You didn't have to do this.

1065
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:01,717
Hey, it was the least
we could do,

1066
00:59:01,800 --> 00:59:03,597
seeing as how you worked
so hard to become

1067
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:05,955
"indispensable"
to the company.

1068
00:59:07,320 --> 00:59:10,198
Is that that new thing
called sarcasm?

1069
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:14,114
Hal, we all know
you're about as
deep as a puddle.

1070
00:59:14,200 --> 00:59:16,873
In fact, that used to be
part of your charm.

1071
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:19,474
But this just
flat out sucks.

1072
00:59:19,560 --> 00:59:20,549
What are you
talking about?

1073
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:25,714
If you have one ounce of
integrity left, you'll
break it off immediately,

1074
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:28,075
before you hurt
the poor girl.

1075
00:59:36,600 --> 00:59:41,230
I gotta give you credit
for being more proactive
and starting to meet women

1076
00:59:41,320 --> 00:59:43,629
and who knows? Maybe you are
on a roll here or something.

1077
00:59:43,720 --> 00:59:46,996
But don't you think
it's time to raise
the bar a little?

1078
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:50,671
I mean, at first
I thought you were in
a slump, you know?

1079
00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:53,228
I could, as a friend,
look the other way

1080
00:59:53,360 --> 00:59:55,669
while you banged
a few fatties and got it
out of your system.

1081
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:58,069
But there's lots of
good-eatin' fish out there.

1082
00:59:58,160 --> 01:00:00,469
You don't have to snack
on carp anymore.

1083
01:00:00,560 --> 01:00:03,632
I suppose the girls
we partied with a couple
weeks ago downtown

1084
01:00:03,720 --> 01:00:05,438
were a couple of carp, too?

1085
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:07,078
No. Laura, the one
with the whiskers,

1086
01:00:07,160 --> 01:00:09,355
she looked more
like a catfish.

1087
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:12,034
Oh, I see.
And what about Marie?

1088
01:00:12,600 --> 01:00:13,999
Pop some bolts on her neck,

1089
01:00:14,080 --> 01:00:16,116
and the villagers
will be chasing her.

1090
01:00:16,200 --> 01:00:18,156
And Vicki?
Who?

1091
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:19,639
Vicki!
Who's Vicki?

1092
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:22,797
Vicki Vicki.
With the short brown hair.

1093
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:26,236
Vicki?
I thought that was a guy.
I was calling her Vic!

1094
01:00:26,320 --> 01:00:28,834
Oh, you're out
of your mind!

1095
01:00:28,920 --> 01:00:31,275
Look, I know I'm being
a little harsh on you here.

1096
01:00:31,360 --> 01:00:34,909
I think real friends
are obligated to be
honest with each other.

1097
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,389
This one that
you're dating now...
Jeez.

1098
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:40,633
Careful.

1099
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:44,759
Hey, all I'm saying
is she's got cankles,
for God's sake.

1100
01:00:44,840 --> 01:00:45,875
What?

1101
01:00:45,960 --> 01:00:47,313
Cankles!
She's got no ankles.

1102
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:50,153
The calf merged with the foot,
cut out the middleman.

1103
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:51,468
She has coffee cans.

1104
01:00:51,560 --> 01:00:52,754
I know what cankles are.

1105
01:00:52,840 --> 01:00:54,637
Rosemary doesn't have 'em.

1106
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:57,712
You know what?
I know what
you're doing here.

1107
01:00:58,720 --> 01:01:00,312
You're scared.

1108
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:01,435
Scared?

1109
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:05,832
Yup. This is exactly what
you did with the knockout
with the weird frinkly toe.

1110
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:10,198
You're inventing reasons
to dump girls
'cause you're afraid.

1111
01:01:10,280 --> 01:01:13,431
All right, look.
I admit Rosemary is
kind of cool, all right?

1112
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:16,512
But admit you wouldn't
talk to that woolly mammoth

1113
01:01:16,600 --> 01:01:18,716
if her father wasn't
company president.

1114
01:01:24,360 --> 01:01:25,429
What?

1115
01:01:33,800 --> 01:01:36,678
I guarantee you've never
met anyone like this guy
who's coming with us.

1116
01:01:36,760 --> 01:01:37,875
You're gonna love him.

1117
01:01:37,960 --> 01:01:39,313
Great.

1118
01:01:39,400 --> 01:01:40,628
What's his girlfriend like?

1119
01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:41,869
I haven't met her.

1120
01:01:41,960 --> 01:01:44,235
They just started going out.
Oh, there he is.

1121
01:01:44,840 --> 01:01:46,751
Walt!

1122
01:01:46,840 --> 01:01:48,034
At your cervix!

1123
01:01:49,640 --> 01:01:51,870
Hey, you recognize
these panties?

1124
01:01:51,960 --> 01:01:55,111
Rosemary, don't
steal my lines.

1125
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:56,872
You two know each other?

1126
01:01:56,960 --> 01:01:58,075
Yeah!

1127
01:01:58,160 --> 01:02:01,675
Gosh, WaIt's been
volunteering down at
the hospital for years.

1128
01:02:01,800 --> 01:02:02,835
Oh.

1129
01:02:02,920 --> 01:02:05,229
So where's this
mystery girl?

1130
01:02:05,760 --> 01:02:08,149
She should be
here any minute.

1131
01:02:10,800 --> 01:02:14,588
Hey, I want you
to be honest.

1132
01:02:14,680 --> 01:02:17,797
Is this outfit too
"Hey, look at me"?

1133
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:21,356
No, no.
It's very subtle.

1134
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:32,311
Sorry I'm late.

1135
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:33,435
Tanya.

1136
01:02:34,640 --> 01:02:36,676
Oh. What a surprise.

1137
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:39,159
(SUMMER DAYS PLAYING)

1138
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:45,913
I've spent all
summer days drivin'

1139
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:51,232
I'm tired of
holidays ruined

1140
01:02:52,160 --> 01:02:55,630
No more takeaways,
expired food

1141
01:02:55,720 --> 01:02:56,835
I gotta get a map.

1142
01:02:57,440 --> 01:02:59,237
I'm going with you.

1143
01:02:59,320 --> 01:03:00,992
What are those for?

1144
01:03:01,080 --> 01:03:04,197
Ever walk through
a truck-stop men's
room on your hands?

1145
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:06,032
(LAUGHS WEAKLY)

1146
01:03:09,120 --> 01:03:10,269
Want anything?

1147
01:03:10,360 --> 01:03:12,271
Potato chips.
And dip.

1148
01:03:15,080 --> 01:03:16,308
Cut it out.

1149
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:17,469
(LAUGHS)

1150
01:03:18,600 --> 01:03:23,594
So, Tanya, I had no idea
that you and Walt were,
you know, seeing each other.

1151
01:03:23,680 --> 01:03:25,955
Yeah. You got a light?

1152
01:03:35,240 --> 01:03:37,310
It's actually
a very funny story.

1153
01:03:37,400 --> 01:03:40,472
Because he had been
asking me out for
a really long time,

1154
01:03:40,560 --> 01:03:43,028
and I was always
kind of unavailable.

1155
01:03:43,120 --> 01:03:45,190
And then just when
he had given up,

1156
01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:48,192
I broke up
with my boyfriend,
and there he was.

1157
01:03:48,280 --> 01:03:50,555
So I asked him out.

1158
01:03:50,680 --> 01:03:53,069
So he kind of grew
on you, huh?

1159
01:03:53,160 --> 01:03:57,073
Exactly. I mean,
you gotta admit,

1160
01:03:57,160 --> 01:04:00,436
when you first meet him,
it is kind of jarring.

1161
01:04:00,520 --> 01:04:04,069
I mean, you kind of
don't even know
what goes where.

1162
01:04:04,160 --> 01:04:07,357
But anyway, the timing
couldn't have
been more perfect,

1163
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:10,318
because he had just
sold his company,

1164
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:12,470
and he has all this
time on his hands,

1165
01:04:12,560 --> 01:04:15,358
and we can plan things,

1166
01:04:15,440 --> 01:04:18,637
and travel, and go
shopping and...

1167
01:04:20,320 --> 01:04:22,754
Well, I guess
timing's everything.

1168
01:04:27,600 --> 01:04:29,591
Hope you like bean dip.

1169
01:04:30,360 --> 01:04:32,078
(COUNTRYSIDE WITH YOU PLAYING)

1170
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:35,709
I'd already picked up
all the faces

1171
01:04:35,800 --> 01:04:39,588
And I, I wanna
show you all the places

1172
01:04:39,680 --> 01:04:43,798
And I, I wanna
take a little ride

01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:46,155
Wanna take a little ride

1174
01:04:46,240 --> 01:04:48,993
In the countryside
with you

1175
01:04:51,640 --> 01:04:53,631
(CHEERING)

1176
01:05:08,040 --> 01:05:10,235
Yeah! That was
my girl.

1177
01:05:10,320 --> 01:05:12,629
Oh, my God. I'm
the biggest nerd.

1178
01:05:12,760 --> 01:05:13,795
Mmm-mmm.

1179
01:05:13,880 --> 01:05:15,359
Rosemary!

1180
01:05:15,440 --> 01:05:16,475
Ralph!

1181
01:05:17,080 --> 01:05:18,433
Hi.

1182
01:05:19,600 --> 01:05:21,079
You remember Li'iBoy?

1183
01:05:22,120 --> 01:05:23,599
Li'iBoy. Yeah.

1184
01:05:23,680 --> 01:05:25,272
How are you?

1185
01:05:25,400 --> 01:05:26,594
Mahalo, Rosemary.

1186
01:05:26,680 --> 01:05:28,033
How you doing?
Great.

1187
01:05:28,120 --> 01:05:32,159
Wow. Do they still got
you out in Sierra Leone?

1188
01:05:32,520 --> 01:05:34,476
No, no. Now they got
me near my home.

1189
01:05:34,560 --> 01:05:37,393
I'm on this island
in the South Pacific
called Carabas.

1190
01:05:37,480 --> 01:05:38,879
I'm Hal.

1191
01:05:38,960 --> 01:05:40,951
Oh, I'm sorry. Hal.

1192
01:05:41,840 --> 01:05:43,193
These are my
Peace Corps buddies.

1193
01:05:43,280 --> 01:05:47,034
This is Ralph Owens
and Li'iBoy.
This is Hal Larson.

1194
01:05:47,120 --> 01:05:48,838
What's up?
Li'iBoy.

1195
01:05:51,960 --> 01:05:54,599
So, what are you guys
doing up here?

1196
01:05:54,720 --> 01:05:57,678
Li'iBoy's been stuck
in the office training
for the last 30 days,

1197
01:05:57,760 --> 01:06:00,149
so I dragged him up here
and threw him on the slopes.

1198
01:06:00,240 --> 01:06:01,878
It wasn't pretty.

1199
01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:05,111
I knew this Hawaiian guy
in high school

1200
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:08,749
who went out
for the hockey team.
It was funny as shit.

1201
01:06:13,960 --> 01:06:18,033
Anyway, it's great
to see you again.

1202
01:06:19,360 --> 01:06:22,432
You look happy.

1203
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:25,873
Thanks. I am.

1204
01:06:29,240 --> 01:06:31,959
Well, we got a long
drive back, so...

1205
01:06:33,680 --> 01:06:34,829
Bye.

1206
01:06:34,920 --> 01:06:36,319
Bye.
Good to meet ya.

1207
01:06:41,720 --> 01:06:43,039
You okay?

1208
01:06:43,600 --> 01:06:44,874
Uh-huh.

1209
01:06:45,600 --> 01:06:49,149
It's just that do you
remember how I told you
that once I had a boyfriend?

1210
01:06:49,240 --> 01:06:50,639
Uh-huh.

1211
01:06:50,720 --> 01:06:52,233
That was him.

1212
01:07:02,120 --> 01:07:04,714
You're welcome.
Sure. What's your name?

1213
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,753
Excuse me, Mr. Robbins.
Can I have a word
with you, sir?

1214
01:07:09,840 --> 01:07:11,319
Sure, but I gotta
catch a plane.

1215
01:07:11,400 --> 01:07:13,038
It's only gonna
take a minute.

1216
01:07:13,120 --> 01:07:17,033
A few weeks ago,
you got trapped in an
elevator with my friend.

1217
01:07:17,120 --> 01:07:19,350
Oh, yeah! Hal.
He was a great guy.
Yes.

1218
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:21,510
He was having relationship
troubles. How is he?

1219
01:07:21,640 --> 01:07:23,949
That's a matter
of debate.

1220
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:25,515
Really?

1221
01:07:25,600 --> 01:07:28,876
Anyway, apparently,
you gave him
like a pep talk,

1222
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:33,351
and now he's under
the impression that he can
get any woman he wants.

1223
01:07:33,720 --> 01:07:35,676
And you don't think he can?

1224
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:36,875
I don't know. Whatever.

1225
01:07:36,960 --> 01:07:42,830
But see, the point is,
lately the only women
he wants are ugly.

1226
01:07:42,920 --> 01:07:44,876
Who says they're ugly?

1227
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:46,552
Bausch & Lomb.

1228
01:07:46,640 --> 01:07:48,676
And very fat,
some of them.

1229
01:07:48,760 --> 01:07:51,558
It's like Hal has
lowered his whole...

1230
01:07:51,640 --> 01:07:54,074
Jesus, you've got
a big noggin.

1231
01:07:54,160 --> 01:07:55,275
Thanks for noticing.

1232
01:07:55,360 --> 01:07:57,555
My new book has
a chapter on blurting.

1233
01:07:57,640 --> 01:07:59,153
You might want
to pick it up.

1234
01:07:59,240 --> 01:08:00,878
Yeah, I'll check into that.

1235
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:03,758
Anyway, I mean,
did something
go wrong here?

1236
01:08:03,840 --> 01:08:06,229
Is he having
a nervous breakdown?

1237
01:08:06,320 --> 01:08:08,595
No. Haven't you
heard the phrase,

1238
01:08:08,680 --> 01:08:10,318
"Beauty is in the eye
of the beholder"?

1239
01:08:10,440 --> 01:08:13,432
Yeah. Did you ever
hear the song
Who Let the Dogs Out?

1240
01:08:14,480 --> 01:08:15,515
It can't be that bad.

1241
01:08:16,360 --> 01:08:19,113
Look, exactly what did
you do to him, man?

1242
01:08:19,240 --> 01:08:21,549
I altered his perception
a little bit.

1243
01:08:22,880 --> 01:08:26,429
I knew it. I knew it!
I knew it!

1244
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:28,391
You messed with
his eyesight, right?
No.

1245
01:08:28,480 --> 01:08:30,391
No. You hypnotized him.

1246
01:08:30,480 --> 01:08:33,677
No. I dehypnotized him.
He's been hypnotized
his whole life.

1247
01:08:33,760 --> 01:08:35,751
He's totally focused
on the outside.

1248
01:08:35,880 --> 01:08:38,474
I helped him
see inner beauty,

1249
01:08:38,560 --> 01:08:41,279
including people you think
are not physically attractive.

1250
01:08:41,360 --> 01:08:45,672
How can he see their
inner beauty when he
doesn't even know them?

1251
01:08:45,760 --> 01:08:48,433
Inner beauty's easy to see
when you're looking for it.

1252
01:08:48,560 --> 01:08:52,872
But how can he not
feel them when he's...

1253
01:08:53,280 --> 01:08:54,872
(GROANS IN DISGUST)

1254
01:08:54,960 --> 01:08:57,793
The brain sees
what the heart
wants it to feel.

1255
01:08:57,880 --> 01:09:01,236
All right, look.
Let's just cut through the
old crapcake here, huh?

1256
01:09:01,320 --> 01:09:02,799
Okay.

1257
01:09:05,200 --> 01:09:12,072
Sir, don't you
think it's wrong to
brainwash someone?

1258
01:09:12,160 --> 01:09:14,037
Don't you think
you're brainwashed?

1259
01:09:14,120 --> 01:09:16,156
All you know about beauty
is programmed.

1260
01:09:16,240 --> 01:09:19,915
TV, magazines, movies,
they all tell you
what's beautiful, what isn't.

1261
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,514
How's this any different?

1262
01:09:22,600 --> 01:09:26,309
Look, I didn't come
here to debate you!
I just want my friend back!

1263
01:09:26,400 --> 01:09:30,951
Now, isn't there
some kind of word or
phrase or something

1264
01:09:31,040 --> 01:09:32,519
to take the whammy off him?

1265
01:09:32,600 --> 01:09:34,033
Of course.
But if we do that,

1266
01:09:34,120 --> 01:09:37,351
he'll go back to
judging everybody
by the outside.

1267
01:09:37,440 --> 01:09:38,998
Is this what
he really wants?

1268
01:09:39,080 --> 01:09:41,150
I don't care!

1269
01:09:41,280 --> 01:09:43,953
It's what I want!
I want my friend back!

1270
01:09:44,600 --> 01:09:47,353
I gotta go.
I gotta catch my plane.
I'm really sorry.

1271
01:09:47,440 --> 01:09:52,070
Look, a man's reputation,
dignity and furniture are
being trashed here!

1272
01:09:52,160 --> 01:09:56,039
Perhaps irreparably!
For God's sakes,
his job is in jeopardy!

1273
01:09:57,280 --> 01:09:58,315
His job? Really?

1274
01:09:58,400 --> 01:09:59,753
Yes. And it's a great job.

1275
01:10:04,280 --> 01:10:07,431
I just wanted to
give him a gift. I didn't
want him to get hurt.

1276
01:10:07,520 --> 01:10:10,318
You seem to know him
better than I do, so...

1277
01:10:10,400 --> 01:10:12,038
It's a shame to let it go.

1278
01:10:12,120 --> 01:10:13,633
Oh, it's a tragedy.

1279
01:10:15,800 --> 01:10:18,917
So, what'd you wanna
talk to me about?

1280
01:10:23,120 --> 01:10:25,270
Um, Ralph called me.

1281
01:10:26,200 --> 01:10:27,679
Your old boyfriend Ralph?

1282
01:10:27,760 --> 01:10:32,276
Well, he was also
my division leader
in Sierra Leone.

1283
01:10:32,360 --> 01:10:36,194
Anyway, he's shipping out
to Carabas in 10 days,

1284
01:10:36,280 --> 01:10:37,998
and he wants me
to go with his group.

1285
01:10:38,080 --> 01:10:41,390
What? You and Ralph?
Carabas?

1286
01:10:41,480 --> 01:10:44,119
They're in
an economic meltdown.

1287
01:10:44,200 --> 01:10:49,194
100,000 people need
medical supplies and food,
and they want me to help.

1288
01:10:49,680 --> 01:10:52,114
How can you be so selfish?

1289
01:10:52,200 --> 01:10:53,428
Sorry?

1290
01:10:53,560 --> 01:10:55,232
I mean, you know
what I'm saying.

1291
01:10:55,320 --> 01:10:58,630
You bump into pretty boy
Ralph on Friday,
the sparks are flying,

1292
01:10:58,720 --> 01:11:02,429
and now you're gonna go
and save the world in Carabas?

1293
01:11:02,520 --> 01:11:05,080
This has nothing to do
with me and Ralph.

1294
01:11:05,160 --> 01:11:06,149
Yeah, right.

1295
01:11:06,640 --> 01:11:08,551
He's obviously
crazy about you.

1296
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:10,870
He's got
the heart of a saint.

1297
01:11:10,960 --> 01:11:15,112
I could practically see
the halo around his head.
I can't compete with that.

1298
01:11:15,480 --> 01:11:19,268
Okay, first of all, you're
probably the only person
in the free world

1299
01:11:19,360 --> 01:11:21,590
to ever refer to Ralph
as a "pretty boy."

1300
01:11:21,680 --> 01:11:25,434
Secondly, that halo
around his head,
it's called psoriasis.

1301
01:11:25,520 --> 01:11:28,557
You can't stand near him
without getting flaked on.

1302
01:11:28,680 --> 01:11:32,434
And thirdly, and fourthly,
yes, he's a great guy
and he cares about me,

1303
01:11:32,520 --> 01:11:35,432
but he had no
sense of humor.

1304
01:11:35,560 --> 01:11:38,393
And I'm in love with
an even greater guy.

1305
01:11:39,720 --> 01:11:43,474
Well, then how come
I don't have any say
in this thing?

1306
01:11:43,560 --> 01:11:44,879
You do. That's why...

1307
01:11:46,840 --> 01:11:49,957
Oh, no! God,
are you okay?

1308
01:11:50,040 --> 01:11:52,395
I think so.

1309
01:11:52,480 --> 01:11:54,311
Oh, my God.
I am so sorry.

1310
01:11:54,400 --> 01:11:56,630
You should be sorry!
It's an outrage!

1311
01:11:56,720 --> 01:11:57,869
I'll go get help.

1312
01:11:58,000 --> 01:11:59,752
Okay. Are you okay,
sweetie?

1313
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:01,478
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

1314
01:12:01,560 --> 01:12:03,312
I'm so embarrassed.
Don't be.

1315
01:12:03,400 --> 01:12:07,951
It's this flimsy-ass
four-star restaurant.

1316
01:12:08,040 --> 01:12:10,873
Just sit right there.
I'm gonna go talk to
the manager, okay?

1317
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:12,871
I'll be right back.

1318
01:12:15,320 --> 01:12:17,231
Good night.
Thank you.

1319
01:12:18,440 --> 01:12:21,910
Look, I'm not blaming you,
but I need an extra chair.

1320
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:23,991
My girlfriend's jinxed
when it comes to furniture.

1321
01:12:24,080 --> 01:12:25,832
Yeah. I know.
I'm so sorry.

1322
01:12:25,920 --> 01:12:27,672
The waiter told me
what happened.

1323
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:29,751
(PHONE RINGS)
One sec. McIntosh's.

1324
01:12:29,840 --> 01:12:30,909
(CELL PHONE RINGS)

1325
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:32,228
Yes.

1326
01:12:33,200 --> 01:12:34,349
Hello?

1327
01:12:34,440 --> 01:12:36,192
MAURICIO:
Shallow Hal wants a gal.

1328
01:12:36,280 --> 01:12:37,269
What?

1329
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:40,034
Shallow Hal wants a gal.

1330
01:12:40,120 --> 01:12:42,031
What the hell
are you talking about?

1331
01:12:42,120 --> 01:12:44,190
I just saved
your life, baby.

1332
01:12:44,280 --> 01:12:45,269
What?

1333
01:12:45,360 --> 01:12:47,157
I've been looking
for you all day.

1334
01:12:47,240 --> 01:12:50,232
I'm at McIntoshs
with Rosemary.
Look, I got kind of a...

1335
01:12:50,320 --> 01:12:51,878
Are you looking
right at her?

1336
01:12:51,960 --> 01:12:53,552
No, I'm talking to
the hostess. But...

1337
01:12:53,680 --> 01:12:55,352
Don't... Hal!

1338
01:12:55,440 --> 01:12:56,919
Look, I got
a situation here.
I'll call you later.

1339
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:58,991
Look away!

1340
01:13:01,640 --> 01:13:04,393
Um, I was just talking
to the hostess.

1341
01:13:04,480 --> 01:13:06,038
Right. That would be me.

1342
01:13:06,120 --> 01:13:08,076
No, no. It was
the other hostess.

1343
01:13:08,600 --> 01:13:11,558
Sir, I'm the only
hostess in the restaurant.

1344
01:13:12,840 --> 01:13:16,037
Let me apologize
about the booth.
We are so sorry.

1345
01:13:16,160 --> 01:13:19,232
We've replaced your
date's side with
a new chair, a strong one,

1346
01:13:19,320 --> 01:13:20,799
and the meal's
gonna be on us.

1347
01:13:21,920 --> 01:13:22,955
Okay.

1348
01:13:23,040 --> 01:13:25,349
Well, thank you.

1349
01:13:25,440 --> 01:13:27,158
You're welcome.

1350
01:13:41,560 --> 01:13:45,030
Excuse me. Did you...
Did you move us?

1351
01:13:45,120 --> 01:13:47,998
No. Second table
on the right.

1352
01:13:50,080 --> 01:13:53,868
Well, then maybe
you can explain to me
why that robust woman

01:13:53,960 --> 01:13:55,757
is eating
my girlfriend's...

1354
01:13:55,840 --> 01:13:58,673
Hey! Now she's eating
my clams casino!

1355
01:14:00,840 --> 01:14:02,751
Sweetie, are you okay?

1357
01:14:04,200 --> 01:14:05,428
Excuse me.

1358
01:14:05,520 --> 01:14:07,511
McIntosh's. Tiffany.

1359
01:14:07,920 --> 01:14:09,512
Mmm-hmm.

1360
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:11,238
Okay.

1361
01:14:33,840 --> 01:14:36,400
We're two friends walking.
Just walking.
Hey, come on.

1362
01:14:36,480 --> 01:14:39,119
And then Robbins confirmed
exactly what I thought!

1363
01:14:39,200 --> 01:14:40,315
Which is?

1364
01:14:40,400 --> 01:14:42,789
You weren't irresistible
to women.

1365
01:14:42,880 --> 01:14:45,838
He hypnotized you
so that really ugly
girls that you met

1366
01:14:45,960 --> 01:14:49,635
from then on would,
to you, look
like supermodels.

1367
01:14:49,720 --> 01:14:51,995
If they had inner beauty
or some baloney.

1368
01:14:52,080 --> 01:14:53,832
See, you could get
any woman you desired

1369
01:14:53,920 --> 01:14:57,151
because you were
suddenly desiring
the undesirable!

1370
01:14:57,240 --> 01:14:58,275
You get it?

1371
01:14:58,360 --> 01:15:01,397
No, not exactly.
Let me put it this way.

1374
01:15:07,560 --> 01:15:12,156
So what you're saying is
all the pretty girls I've met
lately are not really pretty?

1375
01:15:13,320 --> 01:15:16,312
All right. Let's
look at the facts.

1376
01:15:16,400 --> 01:15:19,597
They were funny,
smart and nice.

1377
01:15:20,760 --> 01:15:22,637
Pretty girls
are not funny!

1378
01:15:22,720 --> 01:15:25,518
And they're certainly
not nice! Not to us!

1379
01:15:25,600 --> 01:15:27,272
When I found out
what he did,

1380
01:15:27,360 --> 01:15:29,316
I had him take
the trance away.

1381
01:15:29,400 --> 01:15:34,918
When I said,
"Shallow Hal wants a gal,"
you were cured.

1382
01:15:35,760 --> 01:15:37,910
You're out of your mind.
Do you know that?

1383
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:39,513

to the restaurant.

1385
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:43,353
Hal!

1386
01:15:44,440 --> 01:15:46,317
You never called me back.

1387
01:15:46,400 --> 01:15:48,789
What happened to you?
Excuse me?

1388
01:15:49,560 --> 01:15:50,993
Oh. (LAUGHS)

1389
01:15:51,800 --> 01:15:53,711

of my grandma,

1393

Oh, wait a minute!

1395
01:16:11,240 --> 01:16:14,437
Nice try, Mauricio.
Where'd you find this one?

1396
01:16:17,320 --> 01:16:19,629
No, it's me Katrina.

1397
01:16:20,680 --> 01:16:24,229
From Boston.
The magical fruit?

1398
01:16:24,320 --> 01:16:27,915
Yes, I remember Katrina.
But the thing is,
you're not...

1399
01:16:32,160 --> 01:16:34,674
I never told you about...

I had a beautiful, caring,
funny, intelligent woman,

1404
01:16:52,560 --> 01:16:54,437
and you made her
disappear!

1405

Oh, no, I didn't.

1406
01:16:56,720 --> 01:16:59,359
I just made Rosemary appear!

1407
01:16:59,440 --> 01:17:01,795
There's a difference.
It's called reality.

1408
01:17:01,880 --> 01:17:07,034
Hey, if you can see something
and hear it and smell it,
what keeps it from being real?

1409

that it's real.

Okay, let me ask
you a question.

1412

Who's the all-time
love of your life?

1413
01:17:20,160 --> 01:17:21,354
Wonder Woman.

1414
01:17:21,920 --> 01:17:25,435
Okay. Let's say Wonder Woman
falls in love with you, right?

1415
01:17:25,520 --> 01:17:29,399
Would it bother you
if the rest of the world
didn't find her attractive?

1416
01:17:29,480 --> 01:17:31,994
Not at all.
'Cause I know
they'd be wrong.

1417
01:17:32,080 --> 01:17:35,311
That's what I had
with Rosemary!

1418
01:17:35,400 --> 01:17:38,437

I don't care what
anybody else saw!

about it that way.

Then puts you back under.
Good idea.

1428
01:17:59,560 --> 01:18:01,994
For now, avoid Rosemary.

1429
01:18:02,080 --> 01:18:03,069
Why?

1430
01:18:03,160 --> 01:18:05,390
Because if you see
the real Rosemary,

1431
01:18:05,480 --> 01:18:07,072
hypnosis is not
gonna help you.

01:23:12,840 --> 01:23:16,389
What happened to you?

1522
01:23:19,240 --> 01:23:23,233
I can't get to you

1523
01:23:24,240 --> 01:23:27,550
'Cause there's a wall
in your heart

1524
01:23:27,640 --> 01:23:30,677
That no one can
get through

1525
01:23:30,760 --> 01:23:33,957
And it's cold and it's dark

1526
01:23:34,040 --> 01:23:37,032
And you don't have a clue

1527
01:23:37,120 --> 01:23:40,237
But this wall, it will fall

1528
01:23:40,320 --> 01:23:42,231
If it's the last thing I do

1529
01:23:43,280 --> 01:23:46,078
I'll get through

1530
01:23:48,200 --> 01:23:50,953
This wall in your heart

1531
01:23:51,080 --> 01:23:53,389
HAL: (FU N NY ACCENT)
Who is it?
Hal, is that you?

1532
01:23:53,480 --> 01:23:55,118
It's Jill.

1533
01:23:55,200 --> 01:23:56,269
(NORMAL ACCENT) Coming.

1534
01:23:58,560 --> 01:23:59,834
Hey, what's up?

1535
01:24:00,200 --> 01:24:03,590
My girlfriend just
bailed on me,

1536
01:24:03,680 --> 01:24:07,309
and I was wondering
if I could take you
out to dinner.

1537
01:24:08,280 --> 01:24:09,952
I'm sorry.
Tonight's not good.

1538
01:24:10,040 --> 01:24:12,031
Oh, come on.
Don't be such a stiff.

1539
01:24:12,120 --> 01:24:14,031
I want to talk to you
about some stuff.

1540
01:24:14,120 --> 01:24:15,473
No, really. I can't.

1541
01:24:15,560 --> 01:24:17,949
Please? We'll go
out just as friends.

1542
01:24:19,280 --> 01:24:21,874
Oh, come on.
You gotta eat,
don't you?

1543
01:24:23,640 --> 01:24:25,517
Can I ask you
something, Jill?

1544
01:24:25,600 --> 01:24:26,635
Yeah.

1545
01:24:28,080 --> 01:24:29,957
Why the sudden thaw?

1546
01:24:31,440 --> 01:24:35,149
Well, I've been
thinking a lot.

1547
01:24:36,560 --> 01:24:39,552
Hal, I made a mistake.

1548
01:24:40,960 --> 01:24:42,712
I shouldn't have
broken it off with you.

1549
01:24:42,800 --> 01:24:44,472
Well, you didn't
really break it off.

1550
01:24:44,600 --> 01:24:46,397
I mean, we only had
that one date.

1551
01:24:46,480 --> 01:24:48,914
You did the right thing.
We were going nowhere.

1552
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:51,230
We had nothing
in common,
remember?

1553
01:24:51,320 --> 01:24:54,949
But that was my fault.
I shut you out emotionally.

1554
01:24:55,040 --> 01:24:58,510
We could have had more things
in common if I'd wanted to.

1555
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:00,911
Mr. Shanahan,
how are you this evening?

1556
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:07,109
How am I? Tonight I feel
like a thorn amongst
a bed of roses.

1557
01:25:07,200 --> 01:25:08,792
Your table's ready.
John will seat you.

1558
01:25:08,880 --> 01:25:09,869
Right this way, please.

1559
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:11,513
I'm just gonna go
to the ladies' room.

1560
01:25:11,600 --> 01:25:14,717
Okay, Rosie,
we'll be at the table.

1561
01:25:35,640 --> 01:25:38,518
Yeah.
See, why did you shut me
out in the first place?

1562
01:25:38,600 --> 01:25:40,556
I'm just curious.

1563
01:25:40,640 --> 01:25:45,430
Well, frankly,
I guess I thought
you were shallow.

01:25:47,560 --> 01:25:48,515
Me?

1566
01:25:48,600 --> 01:25:54,630
Yeah. You struck me as this
kind of superficial dickwad.

1567
01:25:54,720 --> 01:25:57,314
I don't know.
What do you call it?

1568
01:25:58,400 --> 01:26:03,155
Hal, it's okay.
I've been watching you
the past few weeks.

1569
01:26:03,240 --> 01:26:05,117
I've seen the women
you go out with.

1570
01:26:05,200 --> 01:26:10,479
And now
I know appearances mean
absolutely nothing to you.

1571
01:26:11,360 --> 01:26:15,273
If anything,
you're pathologically
unshallow.

1572
01:26:16,480 --> 01:26:17,708
I don't know
about that.

1573
01:26:17,800 --> 01:26:18,869
It's true.

1574
01:26:20,560 --> 01:26:23,552
Listen, I have an idea.

1575
01:26:23,640 --> 01:26:27,269
Why don't we get
all this food to go?
Why?

1576
01:26:27,920 --> 01:26:31,595
Because it'll taste
a lot better in bed.

(SIGHS)

1578
01:26:39,360 --> 01:26:43,672
You know,
there are a few times
in a guy's life,

1579
01:26:43,800 --> 01:26:47,110
and I mean like two
or three, tops,

1580
01:26:47,200 --> 01:26:50,397
when he comes
to a crossroads,
and he's gotta decide.

1581
01:26:50,480 --> 01:26:53,711
If he goes one way,
he can continue
what he's doing

1582
01:26:53,800 --> 01:26:55,518
and be with any girl
who will have him,

1583
01:26:55,600 --> 01:26:59,832
and if he goes the other way,
he gets to be
with only one woman,

1584
01:26:59,920 --> 01:27:02,115
maybe for the rest
of his life.

1585
01:27:02,640 --> 01:27:06,474
Now, it seems like
by taking the second road,
he's missing out on a lot.

1586
01:27:06,560 --> 01:27:10,030
But the truth is,
he gets much
more in return.

1587
01:27:10,160 --> 01:27:12,799
He gets to be happy.
Are you wearing panties?

1588
01:27:13,680 --> 01:27:16,592
God, what am I saying? No!

1589
01:27:16,680 --> 01:27:21,629
No, I'm sorry. Jill, this...
This isn't gonna happen.

1590
01:27:25,200 --> 01:27:28,875

that other road for once.

Just you leave me

I don't understand.

The jig is up,
and she knows it!

Well, she hasn't
returned my calls.
What's going on?

1607
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:50,436
It's a little late to be
worrying about that now,
don't you think?

1608

Besides,
she went and accepted that

(SIGHS)

1610
01:28:59,080 --> 01:29:02,470
No offense, Mr. Shanahan,
but I think I have a right
to hear this from her.

1611
01:29:02,560 --> 01:29:05,950
I'll give you your rights.
I'll give you your last rites,

you self-righteous
little shit!

01:29:09,400 --> 01:29:12,915
You know, I wanted
to like you.
I truly did.

1614
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:17,198
And all of that malarkey
that you gave me
that night at the house,

1615
01:29:17,280 --> 01:29:18,554
I bought into it.

1616
01:29:19,120 --> 01:29:23,272
In spite of all me better
instincts, I took the hook.

1617
01:29:24,960 --> 01:29:28,953
I don't know.
Maybe I share
in the blame of it all.

1618
01:29:29,040 --> 01:29:34,194
Maybe I just... I just wanted
to believe that there was
still a decent guy out there.

1619
01:29:34,280 --> 01:29:36,874
A lad that would be
right for me daughter.

Don't speak!
Just you listen!

as it turns out,
there is a guy out there.

Now you listen to me.

a chance to be happy.

No, come on, Hal.

I didn't know.
What is it?

She ain't got no money,
her clothes are kinda funny

1860
01:45:05,960 --> 01:45:07,029
Later, dudes!

1861
01:45:07,560 --> 01:45:10,950
Her hair is kinda
wild and free

1862
01:45:11,040 --> 01:45:15,795
Oh, but love grows
where my Rosemary goes

1863
01:45:15,880 --> 01:45:18,235
And nobody knows like me...

1864
01:45:18,320 --> 01:45:20,754
Say bye-bye.
Bye-bye.

1865
01:45:20,840 --> 01:45:25,038
She talks kind of lazy,
people say she's crazy

1866
01:45:25,120 --> 01:45:28,271
And her love's a mystery...

1867
01:45:28,360 --> 01:45:30,999
You like puppy dogs,
do you?

1868
01:45:31,080 --> 01:45:33,833
Oh! Anything to do
with dogs, I melt.

1869
01:45:36,440 --> 01:45:39,432
Why don't we go around back,
get a little drink?

1870
01:45:39,600 --> 01:45:42,592
Sure.
Yeah? Come on,
big fella.

1871
01:45:43,120 --> 01:45:46,749
It's a feelin' that's fine,
and I just gotta say

1872
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:48,989
Hey

1873
01:45:49,080 --> 01:45:51,958
She's really got
a magical spell

1874
01:45:52,040 --> 01:45:54,235
And it's workin' so well

1875
01:45:54,320 --> 01:45:57,835
That I can't get away

1876
01:45:57,920 --> 01:46:01,879
I'm a lucky fella
and I just gotta tell her

1877
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:05,754
That I love her endlessly

1878
01:46:05,880 --> 01:46:10,749
Because love grows
where my Rosemary goes

1879
01:46:10,840 --> 01:46:17,791
And nobody knows like me

1880
01:46:26,280 --> 01:46:29,590
There's something
about her hand holdin' mine

1881
01:46:29,680 --> 01:46:34,993
It's a feelin' that's fine,
and I just gotta say, hey

1882
01:46:35,080 --> 01:46:38,390
She's really got
a magical spell

1883
01:46:38,480 --> 01:46:44,350
And it's workin' so well
that I can't get away

1884
01:46:46,360 --> 01:46:50,717
I'm a lucky fella
and I just gotta tell her

1885
01:46:50,840 --> 01:46:54,276
That I love her endlessly

1886
01:46:54,360 --> 01:46:59,388
Because love grows
where my Rosemary goes

1887
01:46:59,480 --> 01:47:05,749
And nobody knows like me

1888
01:47:13,360 --> 01:47:17,592
It keeps growing
every place she's been

1889
01:47:17,680 --> 01:47:20,877
And nobody knows like me

1890
01:47:22,600 --> 01:47:26,798
If you met her
you'll never forget her

1891
01:47:26,960 --> 01:47:30,555
And nobody knows like me

1892
01:47:33,360 --> 01:47:36,318
(COMFORT EAGLE PLAYING)

1893
01:47:40,680 --> 01:47:42,830
We are building a religion

1894
01:47:42,920 --> 01:47:44,831
We are building it bigger

1895
01:47:44,920 --> 01:47:48,629
We are widening the corridors
and adding more lanes

1896
01:47:48,720 --> 01:47:52,713
We are building a religion,
a limited edition

1897
01:47:52,800 --> 01:47:56,793
We are now accepting callers
for these pendant key chains

1898
01:47:56,880 --> 01:48:00,793
To resist it is useless,
it is useless to resist it

1899
01:48:00,880 --> 01:48:04,634
His cigarette is burning
but he never seems to ash

1900
01:48:04,720 --> 01:48:08,633
He is grooming his poodle,
he is living comfort eagle

1901
01:48:08,720 --> 01:48:12,554
You can meet at his location
but you better come with cash

1902
01:48:12,640 --> 01:48:16,519
Now his hat is on backwards,
he can show you his tattoos

1903
01:48:16,600 --> 01:48:19,831
He is in the music business,
he is calling you

1904
01:48:19,920 --> 01:48:20,909
Dude!

1905
01:48:21,040 --> 01:48:24,749
Now today is tomorrow,
and tomorrow today

1906
01:48:24,840 --> 01:48:28,515
And yesterday is weaving
in and out, out, out

1907
01:48:28,600 --> 01:48:32,513
And the fluffy white
lines that the airplane
leaves behind

1908
01:48:32,600 --> 01:48:36,115
Are drifting right in front
of the waning of the moon

1909
01:48:36,200 --> 01:48:38,509
He is handling the money

1910
01:48:38,600 --> 01:48:40,477
He's serving the food

1911
01:48:40,560 --> 01:48:43,632
He knows about your party,
he is calling you

1912
01:48:43,720 --> 01:48:44,675
Dude!

1913
01:48:44,760 --> 01:48:48,355
Now do you believe
in the one big sign?

1914
01:48:48,440 --> 01:48:51,989
The doublewide shine
on the bootheels of your prime

1915
01:48:52,080 --> 01:48:55,868
Doesn't matter
if you're skinny,
doesn't matter if you're fat

1916
01:48:55,960 --> 01:48:59,873
You can dress up like a sultan
in your onion-head hat

1917
01:48:59,960 --> 01:49:04,158
We are building a religion,
we are making a brand

1918
01:49:04,240 --> 01:49:07,710
We're the only ones to turn to
when your castles turn to sand

1919
01:49:07,800 --> 01:49:11,793
Take a bite of this apple,
Mr. Corporate Events

1920
01:49:11,880 --> 01:49:15,839
Take a walk through
the jungle of cardboard
shanties and tents

1921
01:49:15,920 --> 01:49:19,959
Some people drink Pepsi,
some people drink Coke

1922
01:49:20,040 --> 01:49:23,635
The wacky morning deejay
says democracy's a joke

1923
01:49:23,720 --> 01:49:27,872
He says now do you believe
in the one big song?

1924
01:49:27,960 --> 01:49:31,396
He's now accepting callers
who would like to sing along

1925
01:49:31,480 --> 01:49:35,951
He says do you believe
in the one true edge?

1926
01:49:36,040 --> 01:49:39,749
By fastening your safety belts
and stepping towards the ledge

1927
01:49:39,840 --> 01:49:43,549
He is handling the money,
he is serving the food

1928
01:49:43,680 --> 01:49:47,070
He is now accepting callers,
he is calling me

1929
01:49:47,160 --> 01:49:48,149
Dude!

1930
01:49:48,240 --> 01:49:51,755
Now do you believe
in the one big sign?

1931
01:49:51,840 --> 01:49:55,435
The doublewide shine
on the bootheels of your prime

1932
01:49:55,520 --> 01:49:59,433
There's no need
to ask directions if you
ever lose your mind

1933
01:49:59,520 --> 01:50:01,750
We're behind you,
we're behind you

1934
01:50:01,840 --> 01:50:03,751
And let us please remind you

1935
01:50:03,840 --> 01:50:07,355
We can send a car to find you
if you ever lose your way

1936
01:50:23,880 --> 01:50:26,917
(I THINK OF YOU PLAYING)

1937
01:50:41,040 --> 01:50:44,350
I think of you

1938
01:50:48,480 --> 01:50:51,392
Wherever you may go

1939
01:50:52,720 --> 01:50:57,919
I know that you are only
one dream away

1940
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:02,869
So don't give up, baby

1941
01:51:02,960 --> 01:51:06,111
Don't give in

1942
01:51:07,200 --> 01:51:13,230
If we try we can begin again

1943
01:51:15,880 --> 01:51:19,429
I know what we've been through

1944
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:22,673
But I still think of you

1945
01:51:42,080 --> 01:51:45,117
I think of you

1946
01:51:49,520 --> 01:51:51,829
Whenever I get down

1947
01:51:53,880 --> 01:51:56,633
Whenever I get weary

1948
01:51:59,640 --> 01:52:02,359
I think of you

1949
01:52:07,120 --> 01:52:10,192
When you're not around

1950
01:52:11,200 --> 01:52:16,274
I wonder if you hear me
call out your name

1951
01:52:16,360 --> 01:52:21,354
So don't give up, baby

1952
01:52:21,440 --> 01:52:24,000
Don't give in

1953
01:52:25,720 --> 01:52:31,716
If we try we can begin again

1954
01:52:33,880 --> 01:52:37,839
I know what we've been through

1955
01:52:38,320 --> 01:52:42,677
But I still think of you

1956
01:53:00,640 --> 01:53:03,791
I think of you

1957
01:53:08,080 --> 01:53:10,753
Whenever I get down

1958
01:53:12,160 --> 01:53:14,913
Whenever I get weary

1959
01:53:17,720 --> 01:53:19,199
I think of you

1960
01:53:22,360 --> 01:53:24,794
Hey, kid. How 'bout
these Rossi boots?

1961
01:53:24,880 --> 01:53:27,155
They fit like
a glove or what?

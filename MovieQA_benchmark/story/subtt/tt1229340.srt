1
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,793
<i>Ron Burgundy.</i>

2
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:57,199
<i>For years he was the prophet</i>
<i>San Diego turned to for its news.</i>

3
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:01,030
<i>But then, like a shimmering comet,</i>
<i>he disappeared.</i>

4
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:05,154
<i>So where does the next chapter of</i>
<i>the legend of Ron Burgundy begin?</i>

5
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,797
<i>It begins in a place where all great men</i>
<i>go for the second act of their life.</i>

6
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:10,920
<i>New York City!</i>

7
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:31,280
Ron Burgundy!

8
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,958
That lady's got an ass
like the Loch Ness Monster.

9
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:38,154
Thing is mysterious
and ever sought after.

10
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,432
Ron, aren't you going to
say something to him?

11
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,440
Hey, when you've got
an ass like the North Star,

12
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,199
wise men are going to want to follow it.

13
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,714
<i>It was a time</i>
<i>before cell phones and steroids.</i>

14
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:52,232
<i>And for Ron and his now-wife Veronica,</i>
<i>life was good.</i>

15
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:55,831
The Tooth Fairy's exposed breast
made the child uncomfortable.

16
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:59,958
The bishop wore
buttless chaps to the bat mitzvah.

17
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,833
Bat mitzvah.

18
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:06,480
André the Giant
gave a surprisingly nimble foot rub.

19
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,720
Foot rub.

20
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,560
Corningstone. Corningstone.

21
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,715
Oh, no! Oh, no!

22
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,638
They're coming in
through the back door!

23
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:18,760
Oh, no!

24
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:20,870
Oh, no!

25
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,439
Grab the children! Save the children!

26
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:24,916
Five, four...

27
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,636
- Have a great broadcast.
- You, too, darling.

28
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,040
Good evening.

29
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,079
This is the weekend edition of
<i>WBC News at 6:30.</i>

30
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,429
I'm Ron Burgundy.

31
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,074
And I'm Veronica Corningstone.

32
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,600
Our top story tonight.

33
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,154
The U.N. today announced
sanctions against...

34
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:44,069
When the broadcast is over,
send these two up to my office.

35
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,352
Time to make a change.

36
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:54,513
Rumour has it that
after 35 years of manning the helm,

37
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,600
Mack Tannen
is thinking about stepping down.

38
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:58,720
That's right.

39
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:04,949
Do you think we could be getting
the <i>Nightly News,</i> Ron?

40
00:03:05,415 --> 00:03:07,216
I think that's exactly
what's about to happen.

41
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,041
Oh, my God.
That's what's happening, isn't it?

42
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,958
- I'm hyperventilating.
- Yes, I see that.

43
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,240
Look at me.

44
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,556
You... Well.

45
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,512
I'm laughing like
a ventriloquist's dummy.

46
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,074
You are.

47
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,919
Let's stop that before we get in there.

48
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,394
Don't do that in there, darling.

49
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:26,919
Mr Tannen, you are an inspiration, sir.

50
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,833
I've been doing the evening news now
for over 35 years.

51
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,992
- Done a hell of a job.
- Yes, sir.

52
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,315
A hell of a job!

53
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:39,275
The point is,
this is a very demanding job.

54
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,400
Yes.

55
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:45,470
But I'm close to thinking that
you may have what it takes.

56
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,598
Now, let me look at you.

57
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,709
Oh, my God.

58
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,798
Would it be wrong
to say you smell terrific?

59
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,513
- Ron, please!
- Okay.

60
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,480
What are you?

61
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,600
Finnish?

62
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:06,711
Oddly enough,
I'm 100% full-blown Mexican.

63
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,112
From the state of Oaxaca.

64
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:11,391
No, you're not, honey.

65
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,759
Hello, sir.

66
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,712
My heart is racing.

67
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:22,675
I just have to say,
this is super creepy and unorthodox.

68
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:27,391
You like-a da merchandise, huh?

69
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,630
Sorry.

70
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,634
All right.

71
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:40,593
We're about to make
network news history.

72
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,473
- Veronica.
- Yes?

73
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:48,200
You're going to be the first
female full-time network news anchor.

74
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,835
- Oh, my goodness!
- I knew it.

75
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,315
And you, Mr Burgundy...

76
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,995
I'm going to be
the first lactose intolerant anchor.

77
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:57,152
- Mr Burgundy.
- Yes?

78
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,714
You're fired.

79
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,320
Come again?

80
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:01,790
Fired.

81
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:05,796
You are the worst anchorman

82
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,194
I have ever seen.

83
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:11,480
But what did I do wrong?
Name one thing.

84
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:15,350
Korean soldiers
were fired upon in the DMZ!

85
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,594
Jeez, I am so sorry.

86
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:20,076
Someone put the story
in all capital letters,

87
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,192
and I thought I was supposed to yell it.

88
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,679
President Parter... Shit!

89
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:29,755
I mean, President Carter
will speak at the summit Tuesday.

90
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,679
Tony, did I just curse?

91
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,712
Are you kidding me? Shit!

92
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,480
I mean... Shit. Shoot!

93
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:40,034
The slain Civil Rights leader
was eulogised...

94
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:44,312
Did you see that? Right on the lens!

95
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,160
Folks, I'm sorry.

96
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:48,670
I hold myself to
a high professional standard

97
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,474
and you shouldn't
hear that language, okay?

98
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,751
I'm having a shitty day. Fuckstick!

99
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:57,040
Now, I know this is tricky,
given your relationship,

100
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:59,595
so I'm going to
give you the evening to think about it.

101
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,949
I forbid it!

102
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:04,710
You forbid it?
What? Who are you? Julius Caesar?

103
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,600
Who the hell is Julius Caesar?

104
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,598
You know I don't follow the NBA.

105
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,837
Look, I am so sorry
that this happened, Ron,

106
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,270
but you and I,
we're partners, sweetheart.

107
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:17,076
And when something good
happens to me, it also happens to you.

108
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,556
That's ridiculous!

109
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,558
It clearly just happened to you!

110
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,433
You... Be quiet.

111
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,200
Mom?

112
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,873
I'm sorry, Mr and Mrs Burgundy.

113
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,070
He no go to sleep.

114
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,714
Damn it, Lupita,
what have you been doing up there?

115
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:29,990
Eating nachos?

116
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:33,272
Mommy? Daddy?
Why are you yelling at each other?

117
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,512
Did Mom touch Dad's hair again?

118
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:38,275
Walter, honey,
why don't you just go to bed, all right?

119
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,517
Mommy and Daddy
are just having a discussion.

120
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,040
No! He needs to hear this.

121
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,512
He's six years old. He's a man.

122
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,473
Walter, listen to me.

123
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,154
Life isn't a fairy tale.

124
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:51,273
It's not a bunch of
jumping rope and grabbing ass.

125
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,636
It's complicated.

126
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:53,836
What do you want to do with your life?

127
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,189
What do you want to be
when you grow up?

128
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:57,596
I want to be an astronaut or a cowboy!

129
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,791
You're never going to be
any of those, okay?

130
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:00,920
Ron!

131
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,872
You've got to set the bar a lot lower.

132
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,595
Service industry.
Fry cook. Prison guard.

133
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:08,110
Maybe you're
a lighting guy at a porn shoot.

134
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:12,958
Which basically means you hold up
a flashlight while adults do things.

135
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,515
He is a child, Ron!

136
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:17,109
Nah, nah, nah!
He's got hair on his nugs.

137
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,720
He's old enough to hear this.

138
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:19,990
Your father is a wise man.

139
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:22,157
I will lock you in a closet!

140
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,790
Veronica, here's the bottom line.

141
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,472
It's a very simple decision.

142
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:32,356
It's either me or the job.

143
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:35,115
It doesn't have to be a choice, Ron.

144
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,080
Don't do this.

145
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:40,990
Don't throw away everything that
we've worked so hard for.

146
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,870
Me...

147
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:45,110
...or the job.

148
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,357
<i>Hello, and welcome to</i>

169
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,039
<i>Look at you, with that permanent smile.</i>

170
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,240
<i>You think you're so smart,</i>

<i>You just fart out of the top of your head.</i>

You're a punk, Ron Burgundy!

173
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:25,439
Children and animals hate you,
Ron Burgundy!

174
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,195
<i>I would eat dolphins if it was legal!</i>

175
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,596
Unhand me, you buffoons!

176
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,954
All right, first,
you threw up in the shark tank.

177
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,276
Then you fed the seals a chicken gyro?

178
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,720
And now this?

179
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,752
You're fired, you washed-up drunk!

180
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,634
Guess what, Trevor?

181
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,479
Every morning
I get here a half hour early

182
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:47,069
and I sexually assault a starfish!

183
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:51,314
This is the end of the road.
I'm not turning back.

184
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,719
Well, I know it's not a pretty sight.

185
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,320
And you're gonna be the sole witness.

186
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:59,275
If you can't handle it,
you leave the room.

187
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:02,279
Goodbye, my sweet hairy prince.

188
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:10,349
Sweet cream on nipples!

189
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,200
Mr Burgundy? Hello, I...

190
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,880
Oh, my God!

191
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,673
What the hell happened?

192
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:21,072
I tried to hang myself?

193
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,759
Because my life's a mess?

194
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,873
And I saw no other option?

195
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:28,990
I think you're telling the truth, but why
are you saying it like you're lying?

196
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,799
It was a call for help?

197
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:33,992
But it didn't work because I'm too heavy
and the ceiling lamp broke?

198
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,234
Something like that?

199
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:39,000
Yeah, I think you're telling the truth.

200
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,077
I am. That's what happened.

201
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:45,199
These are first-rate flapjacks.

202
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:49,799
I'm telling you, suicide makes you
hungry, I don't care what anyone says.

203
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:54,319
My name is Freddie Shapp, and I'm
a producer of a new kind of news.

204
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,996
We're starting a 24-hour news channel.

205
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:58,389
First of its kind!

206
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:01,194
GNN. The Global News Network.

207
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:07,556
That is without a doubt
the dumbest thing I've ever heard.

208
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:11,112
You mean news
going 24 hours around the clock?

209
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:13,471
A channel that's never off,
in other words?

210
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,752
Yeah. Yeah. Just 24 hours. It's...

211
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:20,438
No offence,
but you are a stupid asshole.

212
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:24,077
Mr Burgundy,
I assure you we are 100% for real.

213
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,590
We've got state-of-the-art facilities
in Manhattan.

214
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:30,634
And Kench Allenby, multi-millionaire
and owner of Koala Airlines.

215
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:33,196
So glad he was acquitted of murder.

216
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:35,118
I'm a big Kench Allenby guy.

217
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:38,120
He's funding the whole network.
He believes in it.

218
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,153
I don't think you understand, Freddie.

219
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:45,839
My hero, Mack Tannen, told me I was
the worst journalist he'd ever seen.

220
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,998
I'm not good enough.

221
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,120
Here.

222
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,516
This is your first week's salary.

223
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:57,070
By the hymen of Olivia Newton-John!

224
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:59,040
What do you say, Ron?

225
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,559
I'll take the job.

226
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:06,198
And I swear I'll be number one again.

227
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:10,555
I'll take back my son,
restore my reputation,

228
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,672
and make everything right
with Veronica.

229
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,393
But more importantly,

230
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:18,480
I'm going to do what God
put Ron Burgundy on this Earth to do.

231
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:21,680
Have salon-quality hair
and read the news.

232
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:25,352
Ron... You've made my day.

233
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:27,631
I've got the best damn
news team in the world.

234
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:30,760
- Your call.
- I just have to find them.

235
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:42,476
San Diago. Looks like
we begin our search right here at home.

236
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:46,475
Last I heard, Champ Kind was fired for
showing his wiener to Pat Summerall.

237
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,756
- Who loves chicken? You do!
- We do!

238
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:54,031
<i>Delicious chicken</i>
<i>Swing on through</i>

239
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,197
<i>Meet the crew!</i>

240
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:00,155
I'm local San Diego legend Champ Kind,
and I believe in two things.

241
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,280
Good chicken,

242
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:05,593
and when the nuclear apocalypse
comes, and it will, I'll be a breeder.

243
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:07,632
So come on by and grab a wing.

244
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,673
<i>'Cause when you do,</i>
<i>you'll say, "Whammy!"</i>

245
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,673
<i>No Catholics or Jews admitted.</i>

246
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:13,916
All right, there you go.

247
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:16,509
One Whammy Special
with Whammy slaw.

248
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:19,640
There's a used Band-Aid
in my coleslaw.

249
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,592
My gosh, let me take care of that.

250
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:24,952
Get out of here before I smash
your head in, you Commie bastard!

251
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:27,515
If you're from the census,
you take me off your list!

252
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:31,229
You never did have much
of a bedside manner, Champ.

253
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,192
Ron? Ron Burgundy?

254
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,391
- Get over here!
- How are you, friend?

255
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,671
God, I have longed for you.

256
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,149
It's good to see you, too.

257
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,680
This feels like home.

258
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,360
Are you all right?

259
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,392
Yeah, I'm fine. Better now.

260
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:47,120
Okay, let's break the huddle here, huh?

261
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,440
- Okay. All right.
- All right.

262
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:51,199
You get back here!

263
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,436
Don't be weird!

264
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:55,111
So, anyway,
Harken sat me down, he said,

265
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:58,074
"Champ, you're a dangerous alcoholic,
a racist,

266
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,635
"and I don't think
you know a lick about sports."

267
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:04,197
And I said, "Ed, you dirty Polack,
it's 10:00 in the morning.

268
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,595
"Let's go have some drinks

269
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:08,599
"and go to a baseball game where
the Mexicans hit some touchdowns."

270
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,720
Then he fires me!

271
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:13,800
Fortunately, on the way out the door,
I fake a work injury.

272
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,752
With the settlement, I bought this place.

273
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:17,960
Well, I'm glad to see
you landed on your feet, Champ.

274
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:20,559
Listen, can I ask you a question?

275
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,075
Sure. Anything.

276
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,994
Is this chicken?

277
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,759
Hell, no.

278
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:29,272
It's really impossible to turn a profit
if you serve real chicken.

279
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,398
Yeah. We use mainly bats.

280
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:32,520
- What?
- Yeah.

281
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,557
But the good quality kind.

282
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:36,601
That's the most horrible thing
I've ever heard.

283
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:37,680
Yeah?

284
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,552
You got to do what you got to do, right?

285
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,672
So what you got to do
is serve fried bats?

286
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:44,269
Yep. Do you know what they call bats?

287
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:46,671
- Bats.
- "Chicken of the Cave."

288
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,598
No one calls them Chicken of the Cave.

289
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,837
Why don't you have a bite
and stop judging it?

290
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,599
I'm not going to bite into a fried bat.

291
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:53,720
It's delicious.

292
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,439
It's all tendon. Look at it.

293
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:59,475
Was that a bat?

294
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,513
Chicken of the Cave.

295
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,234
What brings you here, Ron?

296
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,751
My friend, we've got a job.
In New York City.

297
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,394
Whammy! I'm in!

298
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:09,789
You've got yourself a sportscaster.

299
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:10,920
Great.

300
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,076
Denny!

301
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:14,710
Lock up!

302
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,600
Any idea where Brian Fantana is?

303
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,040
You haven't heard?

304
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,719
Fantana hit the big time.

305
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,072
Baby.

306
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:26,317
Yeah, that's it, play for me.
Just play around.

307
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:29,075
Roll around and lift those legs up.

308
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,957
You are a hairy little thing, aren't you?

309
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:36,233
Yeah. I like what's happening!

310
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,990
That's it. Yeah. Yeah.

311
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:41,471
You little fuzzball, that's...

312
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,120
I got it.

313
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,435
It's not getting any better than that.

314
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,434
- That's brilliant!
- Yeah, yeah.

315
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,677
Hey, Brian,
you have any time for the little people?

316
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,196
Well, I'll be a son of a bitch.

317
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:03,789
- Hey, Brian.
- Champ! How you doing?

318
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:04,920
Hey!

319
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,360
- This is a...
- Cool it!

320
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,880
I can't believe...

321
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,480
It's great to see you!

322
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,990
Welcome. Welcome to my doj'.

323
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,834
This place is spectacular!

324
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,110
- It's amazing.
- A bit chaotic today.

325
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:18,517
We got the <i>Cat Fancy</i> cover coming out.
You know how that can be.

326
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:20,199
I've been living in a tent
for the last two years.

327
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,720
Yeah, this is not that.

328
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,240
We got a sauna in the kitchen.

329
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:26,512
A lot of people think that's weird,
but I keep wine in it.

330
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:28,996
I'm not a wine guy,
but I know you got to keep it hot.

331
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,952
And check this out.

332
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,719
This was fun.

333
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:35,759
We shot this over two weeks in Prague.

334
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,957
You know what they call cats?

335
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:40,311
- Chicken of the rail yard.
- No.

336
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,199
- What?
- Don't indulge him.

337
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,800
- Yeah.
- There's a lot of meat.

338
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,274
But I love it.

339
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:48,154
And what's so great about it
is it's so damn true.

340
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:49,280
I hate Mondays!

341
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:51,318
I'm not a Monday guy.

342
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,079
Ron hates Mondays.

343
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:55,032
Hell, I'm not crazy about them, either.

344
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:57,277
I also don't like Tuesdays,
Wednesdays or Thursdays.

345
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,593
So why are you guys here, anyway?

346
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:04,396
Well, Brian, we're getting
the news team back together again.

347
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:05,520
Really?

348
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,637
And, of course,
we want to know if you'll join us.

349
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,114
Jeez, I don't know.

350
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:11,596
I kind of got the world by the tail here.

351
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,200
I don't know if I can.

352
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:14,356
Christ, I get it.

353
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,312
I mean, you're the Quincy Jones
of cat photographers.

354
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:17,715
Why would you leave all this?

355
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:21,920
Hey, Brian, I don't know if you heard,
but New York has all-nude strip clubs.

356
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,517
The question still remains...

357
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,400
Where's Brick Tamland?

358
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,200
You guys didn't hear?

359
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:32,674
No, what happened?

360
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:33,800
Brick's

361
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,510
dead.

362
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,589
Brick was lost at sea about a year ago.

363
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:50,030
Thought he saw a bird
and he swam out to pet it.

364
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,276
He never came back.

365
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,956
We all loved Brick,

366
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:56,390
even though he never had
a phone number,

367
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:59,672
or address or Social Security number.

368
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:03,237
In six years of working at the station,
he never cashed a pay cheque.

369
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,396
That sweet Brick.

370
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:05,760
He was a sensitive man, though.

371
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:10,756
He told me he wanted to donate
his organs to science before he died,

372
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,310
so he could see where they ended up.

373
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:17,470
He'll long be remembered
and he'll be sorely missed.

374
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:23,919
Thank you, Reverend.

375
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:26,356
Come on!

376
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,594
- Brick was a great man.
- Really?

377
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,200
And I will miss him so much.

378
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,755
And I will not rest until
I find his killer.

379
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,109
- What?
- His killer?

380
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:37,153
It is hard for me
to believe that he is gone.

381
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:39,233
He's not gone.

382
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:42,360
I feel that I just saw him yesterday.

383
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,312
You were probably
talking to yourself in a mirror.

384
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:47,433
When I got the news,

385
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:50,599
I didn't even know
how to make sense out of it!

386
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:51,876
None of us understand!

387
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,913
Why? Why?

388
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:56,192
Why did you take him from us?

389
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,676
You're clearly standing in front of us,
Brick.

390
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,075
God damn you!

391
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,038
- Brick!
- Brick is dead!

392
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,833
- No, Brick's alive.
- Brick is dead!

393
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,189
- Look at him!
- He's not dead.

394
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:06,436
He's not dead, Brick. You're not dead.

395
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:07,914
- You're Brick!
- Brick, it's you!

396
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:09,156
He's dead!

397
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,280
No!

398
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:12,511
You are Brick! Touch yourself.

399
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,871
- I am Brick?
- Yes!

400
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,032
- I'm alive?
- Yes!

401
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:18,680
Of course.

402
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:19,995
Of course you are.

403
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:21,270
For heaven's sake.

404
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,995
You kind of want to slug him.
You want to slug him.

405
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:30,636
Do you remember
our Easter trip to San Francisco?

406
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:33,559
We got so drunk,
we put Brick in a refrigerator box

407
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:36,320
and threw him off
the Golden Gate Bridge.

408
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,276
I broke my back!

409
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,519
What about the time
that you dared Champ

410
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,791
to drink that beer stein full of Woolite?

411
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:46,201
He drained it faster than you could say,
"No, don't do it.

412
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:48,112
"That's the equivalent of
drinking poison."

413
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:53,079
Oh, Lord, I was in a six-month coma.

414
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:58,475
And they say from the neurological
damage, there's no way I live past 55!

415
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,232
You got three years left, my friend.

416
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:04,113
You're gonna die!

417
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,389
Hey, hey, remember?

418
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:11,480
I was by myself and I had that dream
about the orange tree.

419
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,434
But instead of oranges,
it had babies on it.

420
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,435
It was a baby tree!

421
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:20,270
Brick, how could we remember?
It's your dream.

422
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:23,632
I don't know. It's all the same thing.

423
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,273
It's an interesting dream, but...

424
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:33,073
Or how about the time when I was born
and I came out of the vagina?

425
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:35,759
And I was screaming,

426
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:39,669
"Here I come! Here I come, Mom!"

427
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:43,476
How could we, Brick? We weren't there.

428
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:46,679
We're telling stories involving
the entire news team from the past.

429
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,473
Ron, I can't...

430
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,910
I can't stop laughing, Ron!

431
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,679
Put a pencil in his mouth.

432
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,075
It's okay.

433
00:20:58,800 --> 00:20:59,800
There you go.

434
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,439
I'm okay now.

435
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:04,792
Man, this just feels right!
The news team is back!

436
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:09,119
Ron, Brian, Brick, me, even Baxter!

437
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:13,117
That old man is so little and hairy!

438
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:15,396
Hey, Ron, who's driving?

439
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,432
It's okay, it's on cruise control.

440
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:21,712
Who wants some chimichangas?

441
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,118
Best thing I ever did was install
this deep fryer in the 'bago.

442
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:27,836
Ron, why do you have
this bag of bowling balls

443
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:30,031
and this terrarium filled with scorpions?

444
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:32,994
- It's a long, crazy story!
- Hey, Ron.

445
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,476
Cruise control just regulates speed,
it doesn't steer.

446
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:37,920
Come again?

447
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:37,474
Well, that is gonna
make one hell of a story.

448
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:47,474
The Big Apple. Ron Burgundy is back.

449
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,432
Why do they call it the Big Apple, Ron?

450
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:52,439
Because New York has
an apple tree on every street.

451
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,999
Here we are. Welcome to GNN.

452
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:03,389
I don't know, Ron.
You sure about this place?

453
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,716
Guys, I know it's a bit of a mess,
but trust me,

454
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:08,594
everything will be ready
for the launch tomorrow.

455
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:12,396
And we've culled the whole country
for the best newsmen.

456
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:14,113
There's Curtis Knightfish from Houston.

457
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,390
Curtis Knightfish.

458
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,113
They don't get any better than that.

459
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:20,199
And there's Diane Yahwea
from Carson City.

460
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,676
Diane Yahwea.
You know what they call her, right?

461
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,393
"All the Way Yahwea."

462
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:25,749
She's my aunt.

463
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:27,837
And the best in the biz.

464
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:30,316
Jack Lime, out of Chicago.

465
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:34,309
Rumour is Allenby
is giving him one mil a year.

466
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:36,512
That's crazy.
Who's worth that kind of money?

467
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:41,272
Oh, my God!
He's absolutely magnificent!

468
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:44,235
I bet his poop smells like sandalwood.

469
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:45,874
Can I help you, guy?

470
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,400
What was that?

471
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:48,749
I said, "Can I help you, guy?"

472
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,160
What do you mean?

473
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:53,516
Well, you're staring at me, hotshot.

474
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,313
Do you want my autograph?

475
00:23:57,320 --> 00:24:00,950
No, he was just explaining
who you were and I was looking at you.

476
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:04,073
And then he said something
and I was still looking at you.

477
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,471
Jack Lime is a great man!

478
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:16,040
Is that what I sound like when I talk?

479
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:20,870
Is there a problem?

480
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,798
No, no, no. No problem.

481
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:25,151
Well, you're making a face
like you got a problem.

482
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:27,078
I'm sorry that I'm making that face.

483
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:30,159
I don't mean to make a face
that seems like I have a problem.

484
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:31,509
I don't like that face!

485
00:24:31,616 --> 00:24:33,296
You need to change it,
and change it quick.

486
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:34,595
Stop making that face.

487
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,393
Is this face better?

488
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:37,520
I don't like...

489
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:40,598
That new face is driving me crazy!
Change it, now!

490
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:41,949
You're getting him mad.

491
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,958
I only have so many faces.

492
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:47,349
I'm just grinding your gears, man.

493
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:49,153
Welcome to the station!

494
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:51,636
We're going to have
a good time together.

495
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:55,151
Oh, my God. That's vintage Jack Lime.

496
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:56,360
Come on, guys.

497
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,630
Let's go meet the boss.

498
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:02,512
We'll have separate cameras for you,
and then sports and then weather.

499
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:04,961
Let me ask you this, Freddie,
how's the new head honcho?

500
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:08,397
Well, Linda Jackson
has a shelf full of Emmys.

501
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:12,794
She's as tough as nails.
And Linda loves to win.

502
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,753
Hey, Linda!

503
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,520
I want to introduce you to Ron Burgundy.

504
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:20,714
Linda Jackson. How are you, my friend?

505
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:21,840
Ron.

506
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:24,074
This is Linda Jackson.

507
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:25,995
Hello, Mr Burgundy.

508
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:30,276
Black.

509
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:33,438
- Black.
- Jesus, just stop, Ron.

510
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:37,796
I'm terribly sorry.
I don't know why I can't stop saying...

511
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:40,113
Black. The word "black."

512
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,720
Hello, Mr Burgundy.

513
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,274
Black.

514
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:45,119
- Black.
- Stop.

515
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,310
Black.

516
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:47,476
Stop saying "black."

517
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,674
- Black. If I don't say it, I'll pass out.
- Stop saying it!

518
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,792
Donna, can you please
get me a cup of coffee?

519
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:58,798
- Right away, Ms Jackson.
- Thank you.

520
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:01,037
- Please be seated. Everyone.
- Sure.

521
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:02,509
Please be seated.

522
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:08,596
Great. So I know that all of you
are aware that the news community

523
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:11,235
is laughing at what we're trying to do
here at 24-hour news.

524
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:12,840
But that is why they brought me in.

525
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:13,996
She's the best!

526
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:16,237
You see, gentlemen, I don't lose.

527
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:18,272
Listen, I feel like I
need to clear the air.

528
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,595
Please don't.

529
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:21,640
I want to say,
on behalf of the entire news team,

530
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:26,232
we are huge supporters
of all African and Americans.

531
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:28,158
Veronica got so tan!

532
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:31,353
I remember the first
African and American I ever saw.

533
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:33,153
It's African-American.

534
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:34,794
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

535
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:37,310
Absolutely 100% positive? It isn't like...

536
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,510
Ron...

537
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:39,994
Fish and chips?

538
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:44,000
Hey, we're all the same on the inside,
stinky and pink.

539
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:45,031
When I was in high school,

540
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:47,072
me and my buddies
used to sneak in the girls' locker room.

541
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,520
We'd peek at the girls in the shower,

542
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:52,031
and I'd look at all of them,
no matter what colour they were.

543
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,160
So...

544
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:56,074
Jesus, this is the worst meeting
I've ever been in.

545
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,550
A black man follows me everywhere
when it's sunny.

546
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:00,717
Actually,
I think that's your shadow, Brick.

547
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:02,115
I call him Leon.

548
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:04,197
And if it's a cloudy day,
what happens to Leon?

549
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,320
He goes home.

550
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:06,360
It's your shadow.

551
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:07,396
He's talking about his shadow.

552
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,910
Shut your damn mouths! Sit down!

553
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:13,440
What's he doing?

554
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:16,160
I think you scared him.
You can't shout at Brick.

555
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:17,760
Is he all right?

556
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:20,430
Can you sing him
a soothing siren song?

557
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:21,789
Just a high melodic...

558
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:25,914
I'm not singing along with you.

559
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:28,798
Come on, Brick. Brick!

560
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:30,593
Linda has a balloon.

561
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,400
You better get him a balloon.

562
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,560
Is this for real, Freddie?

563
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:38,000
Linda, I'm sorry.

564
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:39,679
No, it's okay! It's okay.

565
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:41,871
So you have a black boss,
and it's freaking you out.

566
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,070
Is it freaking you out?

567
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,080
- A little bit, to be honest.
- You freaked out?

568
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,032
- Is it freaking you out?
- She's got a knife!

569
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:49,038
I don't give a shit!

570
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:51,152
We're not all here
to hold hands and sing <i>Kumbaya.</i>

571
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:52,870
Black.

572
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:57,000
So as long as you guys get numbers,
we are gonna get along just fine.

573
00:27:57,320 --> 00:28:00,392
Now, if you don't, I am gonna be icy.

574
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:01,795
And unpleasant, you dig?

575
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:04,480
I dig. We all dig.

576
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:05,790
I like to dig.

577
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:09,516
One time I went digging for treasure
and I found a half a body.

578
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:11,313
Get out of my office!

579
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:15,354
I'm telling you, you can't give an inch
in those situations,

580
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:17,240
and I think
we held our ground pretty firmly.

581
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:18,436
Guys.

582
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:21,678
Guys, we got you an apartment
on the Upper East Side

583
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,280
and a whole new wardrobe.

584
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:26,279
That's wonderful!
When do we begin our broadcast?

585
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,720
Well, the big launch is tomorrow

586
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,274
- at 12:00 noon.
- Okay.

587
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:33,155
You guys are slotted
for the 2:00 a.m. to 5:00 a.m. slot.

588
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:36,513
What? That's the graveyard shift!

589
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:38,479
"I ain't afraid of no ghost."

590
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,592
Come on, it's going to be great.

591
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,677
Let's get your keys. Come on!

592
00:28:44,616 --> 00:28:45,896
Is there booze in the apartment?

593
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:47,673
Of course there's gonna be booze.
Of course.

594
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:10,269
It won't stop.

595
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:13,712
Sometimes it stops,
but then it starts again.

596
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:18,474
What are you doing, Chani? Answer it!

597
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:21,597
Hi. Yes, let me transfer you.

598
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:24,118
Your job is to answer the phones.

599
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,916
I'm getting ready for Secret Santa.
When is that again?

600
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:29,919
It's at Christmastime.
When else would it be?

601
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:35,272
I'm Brick. I was dead last week.

602
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:36,989
I'm Chani.

603
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:40,274
I like the place between
your head and your body.

604
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:42,119
I like your hair.

605
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,113
It looks like wet popcorn.

606
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,114
Thank you.

607
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:49,755
Would you like to see the smile that
I use when I pose for photographs?

608
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:50,916
Yes, please.

609
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:55,557
Do you want to see the face I make
when I see a snake made out of candy?

610
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:57,034
Yes.

611
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:00,920
That's good.

612
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:03,393
What's your favourite time of day?

613
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:04,680
Now.

614
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,394
What's your favourite time of day?

615
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:09,034
A minute ago.

616
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,037
Surprise! Big daddy's back.

617
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,236
Ron.

618
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,200
What are you doing here?

619
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:55,880
I'm over at GNN.
I'm living in the city again.

620
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:58,557
I really wish that
you would have called first.

621
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:01,149
Look, it doesn't matter
whose fault the break-up was, okay?

622
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:02,634
I was stubborn.

623
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:07,152
You were like a mentally ill whore
having PMS from the 1800s.

624
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:08,919
What's your point, Ron?

625
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:12,830
The point is I'm back home.

626
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:15,271
And I want to spend the rest of my life...

627
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:16,834
Honey, who is it?

628
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,880
Hi, Ron. I'm Gary, Veronica's lover.

629
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:35,874
So, is that a gift for me, Ron?

630
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:38,032
No, it's not.

631
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:40,320
It's for Walter.

632
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:41,520
Okay.

633
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:43,752
So when were you going to
tell me about Gary?

634
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:45,599
Ron. You walked out on me.

635
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:48,360
What did you expect me to do?

636
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:51,599
Ron. This is awkward, I know.

637
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:54,873
I'm sitting here with your wife.
We make love.

638
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:58,193
I'm this close to shooting
a flare gun at your dick.

639
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:59,356
Ron!

640
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:01,598
So what does this Gary do for a living?

641
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:03,040
Have you done
a background check on him?

642
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,514
Gary is actually

643
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:07,872
one of the most successful
psychologists in all of Manhattan, Ron.

644
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
Really sweet.

645
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:10,874
Are you reading my mind right now?

646
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,799
Ron, do you even know
what a psychologist is?

647
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:16,274
Fuck you.

648
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:18,240
Ron!

649
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,720
- It's okay.
- You stop that!

650
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:21,120
He's externalising. That's okay.

651
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,112
- No, it's not okay.
- He's mad.

652
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:26,916
You knew I was going to throw that
punch 'cause you're reading my mind!

653
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:29,712
Mom! I'm home!

654
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:31,161
- Hey, little guy.
- Hey, darling.

655
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,879
- Hi, Walter.
- Hey, Dad.

656
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:34,950
I missed you!

657
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,517
Walter, your father has a gift for you.

658
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:41,032
I have a gift specifically for you, Walter.

659
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:43,040
There you go.

660
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,310
Yes, Gary.

661
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:51,039
Okay, that's actually for me, Walter.

662
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:53,231
No, it's not. It's for Walter.

663
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:54,680
It's a superhero costume.

664
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,076
What is it?

665
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:58,910
It's "Lace Man."
It's a brand new superhero.

666
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:01,237
I'm going to be Lace Man!

667
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:02,999
Look, Ron. Joint custody isn't easy.

668
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:07,114
But what we need to do is rally around
this little guy right now, okay?

669
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:08,595
That's never gonna happen.

670
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,040
Excuse me?

671
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:12,311
Because you, Veronica,
are unfit to be a mother!

672
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:15,751
Need I remind you
that you took that child to a cock fight?

673
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,633
- The game of champions!
- I'm Lace Man!

674
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,080
He had the time of his life!

675
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:21,039
He came home splattered in blood!

676
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:23,880
He picked eight winning cocks.
It's never been done!

677
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,720
You have never tried
to connect with Walter.

678
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:29,357
All right, let's keep it civil
in front of the boy.

679
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:32,640
It's bad enough his mother
likes to go down on rodeo clowns.

680
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,791
- Okay, you know what, out!
- All right. Get your things! Let's go.

681
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:35,920
Fine. I'm out of here.

682
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,673
- Don't have to tell me twice.
- Get your things.

683
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:40,190
- We'll see you guys later.
- Yes, you will.

684
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:42,835
Goodbye, Dad! Thanks for the present.

685
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:43,960
Goodbye, Walter.

686
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:47,636
Ron, it was nice meeting you.
I think it's time for you to go.

687
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,236
Ron!

688
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:51,673
You knew!

689
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:53,553
You anticipated that
because you're reading my mind!

690
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:54,680
That confirms it!

691
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:03,796
There's Lime!

692
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:07,357
Look at him. He's a goddamn prince!

693
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:10,314
Man, there's just something about him,
you know?

694
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:12,272
I'd give anything to be friends with him.

695
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:14,751
I don't see what the big deal is,
you know.

696
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:16,200
He's not that great.

697
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:19,270
What did you say?

698
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:21,190
What's that?

699
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:22,714
I heard you say something.

700
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:26,476
What did I say? Nothing.

701
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:28,160
No. I heard you say something.

702
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:29,555
He said you're not that great!

703
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:30,680
Brick!

704
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:32,513
Is that what you said about me?

705
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:34,120
- He's coming over here.
- I know!

706
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,953
I'm gonna rip this guy in half.

707
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:38,991
No, no, no!
Just give me a little piece of him.

708
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:41,312
Jack, look, it's just...

709
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:44,717
The guys look up to you so much,
and I just was a little jealous.

710
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:46,069
I just said some junk.

711
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:48,190
That's funny.

712
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:53,270
Aren't you the guy
who lost his job to his wife?

713
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,359
Shouldn't you be doing her makeup?

714
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:04,955
- All right, guys, that's enough.
- No, shut up, Freddie!

715
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:07,920
And you can shut your mouth,
okay, Jack "Lame"!

716
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:15,069
- You listen to this one, big fella.
- Yeah.

717
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:19,671
I bet you that we beat
your ratings tonight.

718
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:23,751
I'm sorry. I'm trying to keep it together.

719
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:25,758
No, no, no. Don't do this. Don't do this.

720
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:28,475
You're on at 2:00 a.m.
Jack has prime time!

721
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:31,280
Maybe... No. Hey, Freddie, no, no. Hey.

722
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:34,515
I'll take that bet. What are the stakes?

723
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:37,760
If we lose, I'll leave New York.

724
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:40,552
And I'll never read the news again.

725
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:43,953
And if by some
snowball's chance in hell

726
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:47,039
Mr Moustache here
pulls a miracle out of his ass?

727
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:52,594
You change your name to Jack Lame!
Legally.

728
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:56,357
I like this! You're on, Stretch.

729
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:58,034
Everyone heard him?

730
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:59,961
- Freddie, you heard him?
- Yeah. I heard him.

731
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:02,675
- This is on like <i>Pong.</i>
- Okay. Good.

732
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:09,837
Why? Why did you make that bet, Ron?

733
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:12,316
We've got the graveyard shift!
We don't have a chance!

734
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:14,274
All right, everyone!

735
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,392
Ladies and gentlemen,

736
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:21,993
today wouldn't be possible
without the visionary behind GNN.

737
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:25,115
Mr Kench Allenby!

738
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:26,799
Yeah, yeah!

739
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:29,480
Thank you.

740
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,438
All right, cheer.

741
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:37,075
I am jabbered,
just jabbered, full of beans, no doubt.

742
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:39,078
Does anyone else speak Australian?

743
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,680
I thought they talked like us.

744
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:43,679
Can I get you to say with me...

745
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:48,032
We can't quite understand you.

746
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:50,755
How's this? I'm Kench Allenby.

747
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:52,799
- Yes. That's good.
- There we go! Thank you so much.

748
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:56,072
I'm Kench Allenby
and you all know my story.

749
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:57,270
I'm a self-made man.

750
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:01,839
My late, great father, Vadge Allenby,
gave me $300 million,

751
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:06,910
and I toiled my whole bloody life
to turn that into $305 million.

752
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:08,599
True story. True story.

753
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,871
But this is 24-hour news station...

754
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:14,474
This is history.

755
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:16,592
This is like Columbus
discovering the New World.

756
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:21,397
And the captain of this fantastic
voyage is the best newsman in America,

757
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:22,915
Mr Jack Lime!

758
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:26,396
Go get 'em, Jack! Go get 'em!

759
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:29,310
Thank you.
And good luck to Ron Burgundy, too.

760
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:32,720
Getting nervous there, <i>compadre?</i>

761
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:35,080
Let's do this.

762
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:37,516
Did you see that?
How he spun on that desk? So great.

763
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:39,160
All right. Quiet on the floor, please.

764
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:41,556
All right.

765
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:43,400
All right. We're up.
Here we go, here we go.

766
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:46,911
In five, four, three, two...

767
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:51,280
Good day, and welcome to GNN.

768
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:55,076
Thank you for joining us on what we
believe to be a whole new era of news.

769
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,556
I'm Jack Lime,

770
00:37:56,680 --> 00:38:00,799
your guide for this journey of events
we humbly call 24-hour news.

771
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:02,798
<i>Today's top story, Mount St. Helens.</i>

772
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:05,799
This is just a gimmick.
It's a flash in the pan.

773
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:06,990
We better hope so.

774
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:08,440
Let's see here.

775
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:12,912
"Global temperatures rise half a degree,
alarm climate scientists." Boring.

776
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:15,680
"China could dominate
the world economy in the next decade."

777
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:19,509
Nope.

778
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:20,640
Anyone else?

779
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:22,440
What if we show a porno
instead of the news?

780
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:23,520
Freddie?

781
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:25,359
No. Absolutely not.

782
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:26,516
Freddie! Come on!

783
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:27,994
We're just brainstorming here.

784
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:30,715
We're trying to figure out how to
make the news less boring,

785
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:32,832
and you act like
we peed in your milkshake.

786
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:35,191
The news is supposed to be boring,
Ron!

787
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:36,800
This is serious stuff.

788
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:39,357
You're the one that
made this stupid bet!

789
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:44,596
I just don't know why we have to
tell the people what they need to hear.

790
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:47,230
Why can't we just
tell them what they want to hear?

791
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:49,673
Wait, wait, wait.

792
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:52,316
Say that again.

793
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:57,675
I said, why do we have to tell the people
what they need to hear?

794
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:00,200
Why can't we just
tell them what they want to hear?

795
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:02,193
And what do they want to hear, Ron?

796
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:05,279
That we live in the greatest country
God ever created.

797
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:08,230
- Damn straight!
- Made him happy.

798
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:10,477
And we should do stories on patriots.

799
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:13,753
Cute, funny little animals, huh? Or diets.

800
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:16,634
Why blondes have more fun.

801
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:18,593
And serious investigative pieces,

802
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:21,030
about how much ejaculate
is on hotel duvets.

803
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:23,391
And only the best sports highlights.

804
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:26,752
Home runs, slam dunks,
touchdowns and no soccer.

805
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,116
I like the wind!

806
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:30,312
Brick's right. People love hurricanes.

807
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:33,592
Tornadoes, earthquakes, floods, we'll
throw Brick right in the middle of it.

808
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:34,720
You'd do that?

809
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:36,920
People'll go nuts. I'd watch that!

810
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:42,639
No, this goes against every rule
of broadcast journalism I know.

811
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:47,517
Freddie, as the wise man once said,
"So?"

812
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:49,913
We got 10 hours till we go on.

813
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:51,235
We'll only need eight!

814
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:00,679
<i>Lady</i>

815
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:05,032
<i>I'm your knight in shining armour</i>

816
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:07,358
<i>And I love you</i>

817
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:12,549
<i>You have made me what I am</i>

818
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:15,830
<i>And I am yours</i>

819
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:22,918
<i>My love...</i>

820
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:28,071
- Is that candy?
- I don't know.

821
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:35,120
It is candy.

822
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,517
- I like you.
- I like you.

823
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:41,039
Tell me something about you.

824
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:44,679
Well, I'm 19 years old.
My middle name is Courtney.

825
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:48,231
I can always guess how many
jelly beans are in a jelly bean jar,

826
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:49,680
even if it's not right.

827
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:51,274
What about you?

828
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:53,597
My name is Chani Lastnamé.

829
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:56,280
I'm a real go-getter
and a person people.

830
00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:00,794
I can type 50 words a minute
with only 300 errors.

831
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:03,272
I'm trained and certified...

832
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:05,278
To fire a
military-grade missile launcher.

833
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:06,400
Me, too.

834
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:10,439
Chani, I just got
these phone messages from last week.

835
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:11,880
You mailed them to me?

836
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,912
How else was I gonna get them to you?

837
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:15,879
You hand them to me.

838
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:19,436
You are the dumbest person
I've met in my entire life,

839
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:21,711
and that's not an exaggeration.

840
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:22,950
That makes me feel bad.

841
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:25,037
Well, it's the truth, Chani.

842
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:26,640
You!

843
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:29,714
- Leave her alone!
- Excuse me, sir.

844
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:34,270
Get your filthy hands off of her!

845
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:35,470
Help, help!

846
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:36,636
Excuse me, sir!

847
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:38,797
- Leave me alone, lady!
- Excuse me!

848
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:41,480
She is a goddess among women!

849
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:45,310
Glen!

850
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:47,519
My phone messages!

851
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:49,518
Leave him alone!

852
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:50,796
Not today!

853
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:54,154
- She has butterflies in her heart!
- Chani!

854
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:57,000
I can see you behind that desk,
and you're fired!

855
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:58,156
Why?

856
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:08,194
Are you okay?

857
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:10,599
You saved my life.

858
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:12,873
She was trying to set me on fire.

859
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:15,550
I didn't ask for these powers.

860
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:17,034
I was given them.

861
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:21,075
Last night a bird chased me,

862
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:23,352
and I wished it was you.

863
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:25,794
Can we go to a date?

864
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:27,560
Yes.

865
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:44,472
Dear God, please help me pull this off.

866
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:48,794
I swear, if you help me,
I will become a monk.

867
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:51,719
I will shave my head
and become a monk...

868
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:54,720
Who are we kidding?
I'm not going to do that.

869
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:55,990
Did you hear?

870
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:58,160
Evan said there's
some strange copy in the prompter.

871
00:42:58,320 --> 00:42:59,470
It's 2:00 a.m.

872
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:01,637
It's Freddie Shapp's ass, not mine.
Let's go.

873
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:05,276
<i>People who change history</i>
<i>are rarely aware of it while doing so.</i>

874
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:10,796
<i>Ron and his news team simply thought</i>
<i>they were making the news more fun.</i>

875
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:15,990
<i>Little did they know they were changing</i>
<i>the course of broadcast history forever.</i>

876
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:18,919
Hello, America.
It's 2:00 a.m. Eastern time.

877
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:24,475
I'm Ron Burgundy,
and tonight's top story is America.

878
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:26,393
She's the greatest country in the world.

879
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:28,313
<i>Heck, the history of the world!</i>

880
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:29,440
You're damn right!

881
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:34,276
<i>Too much of the news</i>
<i>is about what's wrong with America.</i>

882
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:35,400
Amen, brother!

883
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:38,200
Well, tonight, our top story
is what's right with America.

884
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:40,871
Someone's finally
talking sense on the TV.

885
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,196
For starters, we kick butt.

886
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:45,517
Nazi butt. Russian butt.

887
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:47,035
What the hell is he doing?

888
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:48,594
He's talking about America.

889
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:49,836
Why, do you have a problem with that?

890
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:52,600
While some experts say
silicone breast implants are dangerous,

891
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:54,632
<i>unhealthy and degrading to women,</i>

892
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:59,198
<i>I say, in my most journalistic way I can,</i>
<i>bring on the fun bags.</i>

893
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:00,993
Son of a bitch!

894
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:04,349
Whammy! Whammy!

895
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:06,199
Whammy! Whammy! Whammy!

896
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:08,152
Whammy!

897
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:14,555
<i>Whammy!</i>

898
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:15,796
Back to you, Ron.

899
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:18,640
The wind is really windy.

900
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:21,036
Brick? Brick, can you hear me?

901
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:22,674
I can't hear you, Ron!

902
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:26,476
Okay, but you're answering the
question, so I think you can hear me.

903
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:27,600
No, I can!

904
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:30,713
Brick, do you think there is any danger
to the average person out there?

905
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:33,150
<i>I'm afraid for the animals</i>
<i>of New York, Ron.</i>

906
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:37,873
I saw a woman,
and her dog never touched the ground.

907
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:41,431
You're saying wind gusts
as fast as a supersonic jet?

908
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:43,911
It looked like
she was walking a dog balloon.

909
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:45,475
And go... Switch.

910
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:49,072
And for our eighth
and final animal story of the night,

911
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:51,760
it looks like residents
of North Yulk, Montana,

912
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:55,112
have found the cutest little patriot
on God's green earth.

913
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:00,034
Look at that little guy!

914
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:03,715
He was having some fun.

915
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:08,833
Well, for all of us here at GNN,
I'm Ron Burgundy.

916
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:13,079
And don't just have a great night,
have an American night.

917
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:17,474
And we're out!

918
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:23,038
- I couldn't take my eyes off the screen!
- Yes.

919
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:25,477
You were electric, Ron! Whammy!

920
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:27,273
That just felt right! That felt right!

921
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:28,516
I was outside!

922
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:30,836
You sure were, Brick. Wonderful job.

923
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:32,360
Amazing. Great job.

924
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:36,030
What the hell was that?
What the hell was that?

925
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:39,321
Hey, hey, hey. Take it easy, Linda.
We were just trying something new.

926
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:41,511
You changed the format of
the entire show without consulting me?

927
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:42,640
That's unacceptable!

928
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:45,633
Damn straight, sister.
We just done went and brought it!

929
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:48,195
And here's the truth.
You can't handle it, little mama!

930
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:50,880
Get out!
You are all terminated immediately.

931
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:52,839
If you were a man, I'd knock you out.

932
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:55,635
Really? Well, go ahead!

933
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:57,797
Take a swing! Take your best shot!

934
00:45:58,480 --> 00:45:59,550
I have five brothers,

935
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:01,672
and two of them are defensive backs
in the NFL, so come on!

936
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:03,314
- You want me to do it?
- Yeah.

937
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:04,801
This thing's not gonna feel good.

938
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:05,920
Do it, Ron. Just do it.

939
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,878
Are you scared? What's the problem?

940
00:46:08,120 --> 00:46:09,952
Is he a chicken? Are you a chicken?

941
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:14,436
I'm not a chicken at all.

942
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:16,711
I'm going to make
that moustache of yours all bloody.

943
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:19,590
Well...

944
00:46:20,120 --> 00:46:21,713
Seems like you're buying time, Ron.

945
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:23,115
I'm not buying time.

946
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:26,677
Ron! Just do what men have been doing
for thousands of years,

947
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:28,280
and punch the woman.

948
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:29,600
- Punch her!
- You're stalling.

949
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:30,680
Punch the woman!

950
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:33,519
Here comes the Toledo Express.
All aboard!

951
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:38,480
Ron! No!

952
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:42,751
I didn't do it! Get off me!

953
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:47,709
Mama, your baby's hurt.

954
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:49,674
Your baby.

955
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:53,669
What is that sound you're making?
Good Lord!

956
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:57,357
You sound like a balloon.

957
00:46:57,640 --> 00:46:58,960
Pull yourself together, man.

958
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:00,310
Security!

959
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:02,159
They saw my pee-pee.

960
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:04,920
The eighth grade boys saw my pee-pee!

961
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:06,999
Did you say they saw your pee-pee?

962
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:09,476
In the locker room,
they saw my pee-pee.

963
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:11,792
You just knocked him
back into fifth grade.

964
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:13,036
Get him out of here!

965
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:16,432
Bugger me with a didgeridoo.

966
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:17,960
We knew we'd struggle to start,

967
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:20,436
but these ratings
are lower than I'd even imagined.

968
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:22,358
Thank God for the 2:00 a.m. spike.

969
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:24,073
It really saved our whole launch.

970
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:26,511
Spike? What are you talking about?

971
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:27,960
What spike?

972
00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:30,077
Burgundy. Who's Ron Burgundy?

973
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:32,400
No, no, no, this can't be right.

974
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:37,872
His team start at a.2,
and then they finish at a 5.6?

975
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,993
That's unbelievable!
They tripled Jack Lime's numbers!

976
00:47:41,120 --> 00:47:44,158
How is that even possible?
Who are these guys?

977
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:46,910
They're a local team out of San Diego.

978
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:48,356
You little beauty!

979
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:50,319
Well, they no longer work for us.

980
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:53,480
I fired them.

981
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:58,750
Well, guys, it goes without saying
I owe you gentlemen an apology.

982
00:47:59,120 --> 00:48:03,717
I dragged you out here and this thing
was a disaster from the word "go."

983
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:06,275
No, Ron, don't you beat yourself up.

984
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:07,880
Yeah, it's all right, Ron.

985
00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:09,156
Gin.

986
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:12,312
Brian, any idea what you might do next?

987
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:13,669
Gonna head back to L.A.

988
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:15,401
I got a good group of buddies out there.

989
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:18,080
O.J. Simpson.
Phil Spector. Robert Blake.

990
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:19,793
Sounds like a fun crew.

991
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:21,479
We go out cruising chicks.

992
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:23,199
Call ourselves the "Ladykillers."

993
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:25,630
I love that name. You should get it
on the back of matching jackets.

994
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:27,194
That's not a bad idea.

995
00:48:31,240 --> 00:48:32,240
Guys?

996
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:35,230
Hey.

997
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:37,199
I got some news.

998
00:48:37,360 --> 00:48:40,000
Freddie, we don't exactly want to hear
the word "news" right now.

999
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:41,230
Yeah.

1000
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:44,717
You're right. Forget it.
Forget I was even here.

1001
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:47,960
Forget that GNN wants you back.

1002
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:52,680
For a prime time slot and a raise in pay.

1003
00:48:53,120 --> 00:48:56,113
Quit yanking our penises, Freddie!
What's the deal?

1004
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:58,391
Yeah! Quit yanking our anuses.

1005
00:48:58,520 --> 00:49:00,591
No. I'm not yanking your...

1006
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:04,840
Your ratings went through the roof.

1007
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:07,475
People love what you did.

1008
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:09,992
You're a success!

1009
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:14,592
Get it? You're a great, big, fat success!

1010
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:17,470
By the bed pan of Gene Rayburn!

1011
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:20,440
It's total crap
and they can't stop watching!

1012
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:23,800
<i>The news team</i>
<i>had been famous in San Diego,</i>

1013
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:26,879
<i>but that was small time</i>

1014
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:29,557
<i>This fame was a rocket ship.</i>

1015
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:33,879
<i>A rocket ship that had free drinks</i>
<i>and topless stewardesses.</i>

1016
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,878
That'll do it for all of us here at GNN.

thank me for the news.

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

1021
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:51,989
More graphics, all right?

1022
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:53,600
But there's already a lot.

1023
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:55,837
Hey, you heard the man. More graphics.

1024
00:49:55,960 --> 00:49:58,395
Let a citizen ask a question here,
for God's sake!

1025
00:49:58,520 --> 00:50:01,752
Can Father Ron please shut his mouth
for just half a second?

1026
00:50:04,280 --> 00:50:07,910
This is against everything
that I have worked for my entire life.

1027
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:09,190
Honey, come on.

1028
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:36,476
If you're like me, you need an underwear
that fits your active lifestyle.

1029
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:39,195
<i>At finer speciality</i>
<i>and department stores.</i>

1030

1033
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:52,156
There's something new
on the New York social scene.

1034
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:53,794
It's fun, relatively benign

1035
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:57,072
and costs about as much
as a soda pop at the local drugstore.

1036
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:58,520
Here's Brian Fantana

1037
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:02,839
on why everyone who is someone
is lighting up to smoke crack.

1038
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:05,191
Now, Brian,
I understand we have some crack

1039
00:51:05,320 --> 00:51:06,959
and we're going to smoke it
right here in the studio.

1040
00:51:07,080 --> 00:51:08,196
I don't know if we can get a shot of that.

1041
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:10,073
What is that? Did you know
they were gonna have that?

1042
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:11,200
No.

1043
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:13,829
Now, what you're gonna do is,
you're gonna put your rock in the pipe.

1044
00:51:13,960 --> 00:51:16,395
Is that where the phrase "Put it in your
pipe and smoke it" comes from?

1045
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:17,874
I don't care.

1046
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:20,920
I love it when you do cooking segments.

1047
00:51:24,560 --> 00:51:27,200
You feel that right away.
That's good! That's good!

1048
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:28,881
There's an immediate state of euphoria.

1049
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:32,596
You'll be surprised.
The effect, it happens very...

1050
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:34,791
They're actually enjoying it.

1051
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:36,673
Of course they're enjoying it. It's crack.

1052
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:42,995
Well, now we know, guys,
you can't smoke crack on live television.

1053
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:55,230
Hey, gang.

1054
00:51:55,336 --> 00:51:57,376
You know what would
make this great day even better?

1055
00:51:57,400 --> 00:51:58,400
What?

1056
00:51:58,560 --> 00:52:00,358
Perms for everyone!

1057
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:14,639
Please come in and shut the door.

1058
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:21,079
If this is about sweeps,

1059
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:23,920
I think Brian Fantana
found an outstanding story.

1060
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:26,077
It's about aeroplane parts

1061
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:31,070
that are falling off of aeroplanes out of
the sky and hitting the ground, people.

1062
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:33,032
We're calling it "Death From Above."
We might do some...

1063
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:34,674
You. Come here.

1064
00:52:39,640 --> 00:52:41,313
I've been watching you.

1065
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:42,669
You have?

1066
00:52:44,200 --> 00:52:46,192
I've been watching you a lot.

1067
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:48,994
And you just do whatever you want.

1068
00:52:49,120 --> 00:52:51,589
Well, I'm a bit of a maverick, I guess.

1069
00:52:51,720 --> 00:52:53,393
You don't follow the format.

1070
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:57,878
You pretty much walk around
like you're king of the world.

1071
00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:00,709
I'm just a worker bee. That's all I am.

1072
00:53:01,320 --> 00:53:03,073
- You know what?
- What?

1073
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:09,553
I find it hot as shit!

1074
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:11,599
Are you going to hurt me?

1075
00:53:11,720 --> 00:53:13,074
Here's the thing, Mr Burgundy.

1076
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:15,795
You're a shooting star
and I want to go for a ride.

1077
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:17,959
God, I'm so afraid right now.

1078
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:19,992
Now, I want to hear you meow like a cat.

1079
00:53:24,280 --> 00:53:25,919
Now, I want you to bark like a dog.

1080
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:27,838
Bark. Bark. Bark!

1081
00:53:28,520 --> 00:53:30,000
Like a puppy. Like a puppy.

1082
00:53:35,240 --> 00:53:36,674
Yeah. Come on! Do it!

1083
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:41,754
Don't cry.

1084
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:46,478
It's sexual and yet frightening.
It's an odd mixture.

1085
00:53:47,320 --> 00:53:48,320
Come in.

1086
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:50,430
Linda.

1087
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:52,392
Excuse me, Linda.

1088
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:54,792
Ron, Jack wants to know

1089
00:53:54,920 --> 00:53:58,118
if he can go back to calling himself
Jack Lime instead of Jack Lame.

1090
00:53:58,240 --> 00:53:59,640
He's really struggling with it.

1091
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:02,195
No. Can't. It's a bet.

1092
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:03,874
Jesus!

1093
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,480
If you want to change it, you can.

1094
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:07,000
Like what?

1095
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:08,156
Art Areola.

1096
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:10,397
No! No, that's worse!
You know it's worse!

1097
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:12,512
Lyle Tit or Steve Anus.

1098
00:54:13,160 --> 00:54:14,435
Steve Anuse.

1099
00:54:14,560 --> 00:54:17,234
- No, you've got to say "Anus."
- Got to say "Anus."

1100
00:54:17,360 --> 00:54:18,360
Freddie, I can't.

1101
00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:21,274
Listen to me, Burgundy.
This is far from over, do you hear me?

1102
00:54:22,120 --> 00:54:24,077
I'll see you on the playground.

1103
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:28,269
Well.

1104
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:35,312
This meeting has been very productive.

1105
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:37,193
You can pick me up at 8:00.

1106
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:41,719
Okay, I'm very confused
by what's going on here.

1107
00:54:42,680 --> 00:54:43,680
Get out!

1108
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:54,280
Ron.

1109
00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:59,355
Ron, you are missing some real
high-quality Garfield laughs over here!

1110
00:54:59,480 --> 00:55:01,199
I think our boss just raped me.

1111
00:55:01,320 --> 00:55:02,320
What?

1112
00:55:02,360 --> 00:55:03,919
I don't know what happened.

1113
00:55:04,040 --> 00:55:05,633
All a bit of a blur.

1114
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:09,197
There was hands and hair,
and breath, and lips.

1115
00:55:09,320 --> 00:55:10,800
There might have been
other people, I don't know.

1116
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:12,149
Sounds like she wants you.

1117
00:55:12,280 --> 00:55:13,280
Hey, man.

1118
00:55:13,320 --> 00:55:15,440
Women have been all over me
since we got crazy famous.

1119
00:55:15,560 --> 00:55:18,951
Not to brag or anything, but I just gave
Florence Henderson crabs.

1120
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:22,352
That is in no way a brag, Brian.
That's horrible.

1121
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:25,200
The mom of <i>The Brady Bunch</i>
had a fun time with you,

1122
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:28,392
and then woke up the next day
and realised she had crabs.

1123
00:55:28,520 --> 00:55:31,080
I gave her
a whole Brady Bunch of crabs.

1124
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:34,079
Sounds to me like it's her fault
for being a randy gal.

1125
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:35,429
I have a date!

1126
00:55:35,560 --> 00:55:36,789
Brick has a date?

1127
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:37,920
Good for Brick!

1128
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:39,070
What's a date?

1129
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:41,510
A date is simply
when two people get together,

1130
00:55:41,640 --> 00:55:44,200
do something social, have a few drinks,
yadda-yadda-yadda...

1131
00:55:44,320 --> 00:55:45,436
Take their shirts off...

1132
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:48,679
- It's okay.
- No, it's a fun thing.

1133
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:50,075
It's fun. It's all right.

1134
00:55:50,200 --> 00:55:52,920
Look. Don't worry, Brick,
we got your back, okay?

1135
00:55:53,240 --> 00:55:56,677
First things first,
we need to get you a little protection.

1136
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:01,630
There it is.

1137
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:04,674
Brian Fantana's
glorious cabinet of condoms.

1138
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:08,396
Brian, I know.
How about "The Hooded Guest"?

1139
00:56:08,520 --> 00:56:10,159
I like the cut of your jib.

1140
00:56:11,320 --> 00:56:12,879
That one is ultra-ribbed.

1141
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,959
It's like you're wearing
an armadillo shell on your privates.

1142
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:17,275
It takes two hours to get on.

1143
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:19,835
It's hooded.
She'll never see you coming.

1144
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:21,030
Wait, wait, wait.

1145
00:56:21,160 --> 00:56:22,400
You thinking what I'm thinking?

1146
00:56:22,520 --> 00:56:24,193
Lou Dobin's Good Time Weiner Pouch.

1147
00:56:24,320 --> 00:56:25,320
That's a good one.

1148
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:28,914
Just a drifter
who loves to watch people have sex.

1149
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:32,158
They're made of denim,
so they look better after each washing.

1150
00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:33,873
Talk about a great ride.

1151
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,469
Wait a minute. I've got it.

1152
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:38,794
The Rigid Ghost.

1153
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:41,276
It's the best damn rubber on the market.

1154
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:44,950
I got four of my seven
illegitimate children using this condom.

1155
00:56:45,120 --> 00:56:47,919
But, Brian, isn't that the whole point
of wearing a condom?

1156
00:56:48,040 --> 00:56:49,713
To not impregnate the woman?

1157
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:52,680
Well, you know the old expression.
"Nope."

1158
00:56:57,080 --> 00:56:58,116
Thank you, Ron,

1159
00:56:58,240 --> 00:57:02,075
and happy St Patrick's Day
to all of our Native American friends.

1160
00:57:02,200 --> 00:57:03,350
On the big map...

1161
00:57:05,320 --> 00:57:06,320
Where's my map?

1162
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:08,753
There's no map, it's just green.

1163
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:10,997
No, there's a map there.
Look at the monitor.

1164
00:57:11,120 --> 00:57:13,351
Right.

1165
00:57:13,480 --> 00:57:14,800
Ron, where's my legs?

1166
00:57:14,920 --> 00:57:16,600
- Where are my legs?
- Your legs are there.

1167
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:18,120
I don't have any legs, Ron.

1168
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:20,517
I don't even know how I'm standing up.

1169
00:57:22,520 --> 00:57:24,000
Brick, your legs are fine.

1170
00:57:24,120 --> 00:57:26,271
The colour of your pants just matches...

1171
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:28,199
Ron, I don't have any legs!

1172
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:29,400
The Chroma-Key behind you.

1173
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:31,273
Ninety-three?

1174
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:33,756
Ninety-three?

1175
00:57:33,880 --> 00:57:34,916
Relax.

1176
00:57:38,920 --> 00:57:41,594
And after I received my
Masters in Journalism from Columbia,

1177
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:45,237
I got a job with the London bureau
for ABC News.

1178
00:57:45,360 --> 00:57:46,430
London.

1179
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:49,076
Arguably one of my favourite cities
in the entire world.

1180
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:50,634
I'd put it in my top 90.

1181
00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:54,913
Right in-between Omaha
and Jacksonville, Florida.

1182
00:57:55,360 --> 00:57:58,432
So tell me, what are some of
your favourite haunts?

1183
00:57:58,560 --> 00:58:00,279
Well, I love it all.

1184
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:03,637
Big Ben. The Tower of London.

1185
00:58:04,760 --> 00:58:07,070
Naughty Hill. The Wailing Wall.

1186
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:09,999
Grabbing a sherbet
and walking along the TH-ames.

1187
00:58:10,120 --> 00:58:14,399
It's pronounced "Tames."
You don't pronounce the "T-H."

1188
00:58:14,520 --> 00:58:16,193
Piccadilly.

1189
00:58:16,320 --> 00:58:17,549
Madison Square Garden.

1190
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:19,637
The birthplace of Sherlock Holmes.

1191
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:21,114
Mr Burgundy, are you nervous?

1192
00:58:21,360 --> 00:58:22,360
God, yes.

1193
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:24,512
Did I scare you by coming on so strong?

1194
00:58:24,920 --> 00:58:25,990
A little bit, sure.

1195
00:58:26,520 --> 00:58:28,512
Look, it's not that
you're not attractive...

1196
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:30,552
It's just I'm a little old-fashioned.

1197
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:33,480
Well, I am a modern woman.

1198
00:58:33,880 --> 00:58:37,715
And let me tell you, when I
see something that I want, I go for it.

1199
00:58:38,120 --> 00:58:39,679
Can I ask you a question?

1200
00:58:40,800 --> 00:58:43,110
Is that your foot between my legs?

1201
00:58:43,320 --> 00:58:44,320
No.

1202
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:46,278
I'm sorry.

1203
00:58:47,160 --> 00:58:48,514
It was my hand.

1204
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:49,720
So...

1205
00:58:49,880 --> 00:58:51,241
We're going to do this, aren't we?

1206
00:58:51,360 --> 00:58:54,671
We most definitely are gonna do this.

1207
00:58:54,960 --> 00:59:00,194
I feel a little awkward, because
I'm about to have sex with a black lady!

1208
00:59:00,320 --> 00:59:02,039
I'm sorry! I'm sorry.

1209
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:05,075
That's not the way
I like to handle my business.

1210
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:09,309
When I get nervous, I sometimes
lose control of the volume of my voice.

1211
00:59:09,720 --> 00:59:13,077
Well, I don't mind,
because I am going to have you tonight.

1212
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:16,513
Then let's leave
and go have interracial sex!

1213
00:59:18,320 --> 00:59:19,470
Sorry.

1214
01:00:03,560 --> 01:00:05,841
This is the nicest soda machine
anyone's ever taken me to.

1215
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:08,676
It received five stars.

1216
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:16,873
Can I ask you a personal question?

1217
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:18,839
I'm not sure what that is, but yes.

1218
01:00:19,040 --> 01:00:20,679
Have you ever kissed anyone?

1219
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:23,429
Do lunch boxes
and sleeping people count?

1220
01:00:23,560 --> 01:00:24,755
Of course.

1221
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:26,234
Then, yes.

1222
01:00:26,360 --> 01:00:28,920
I have kissed Scooby-Doo and Roy.

1223
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:32,118
I've only kissed people in my dreams.

1224
01:00:32,440 --> 01:00:37,276
So, I've only kissed a tiny dragon
and a woman with her hair on fire.

1225
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:42,038
I don't have a lot of experience
with kissing, but I do know one thing...

1226
01:00:42,280 --> 01:00:43,873
Always get your teeth involved.

1227
01:00:44,600 --> 01:00:47,593
I think I'm ready
to maybe try that kiss thing now.

1228
01:01:23,168 --> 01:01:24,602
Hello, Ms Jackson.

1229
01:01:25,368 --> 01:01:26,597
I didn't mean to scare you.

1230
01:01:26,888 --> 01:01:29,278
Mr Allenby, I wasn't expecting you to...

1231
01:01:29,728 --> 01:01:31,720
Yeah, no, I know. Neither was I.

1232
01:01:32,703 --> 01:01:34,304
But then I heard about this little story

1233
01:01:34,328 --> 01:01:37,082
that Ron Burgundy and Brian Fantana
are running.

1234
01:01:37,408 --> 01:01:39,286
You see,
some of the planes from my airline

1235
01:01:39,408 --> 01:01:41,286
have had parts falling off them lately.

1236
01:01:41,688 --> 01:01:43,407
Is it a problem? Yeah.

1237
01:01:43,528 --> 01:01:46,282
Is it being fixed? I don't know, probably.

1238
01:01:46,608 --> 01:01:49,885
But if that story runs,
then Koala stock will plummet.

1239
01:01:50,448 --> 01:01:53,168
We can't just pull the story.
That would be unethical.

1240
01:01:53,448 --> 01:01:56,441
We own the news.
We can do whatever we want.

1241
01:01:56,928 --> 01:01:58,521
That's one of the perks.

1242
01:01:58,928 --> 01:02:02,365
It's called "synergy."
One company working with another.

1243
01:02:05,808 --> 01:02:07,162
To synergy.

1244
01:02:15,128 --> 01:02:17,484
You seem a little quiet, I must say.

1245
01:02:17,928 --> 01:02:21,399
Just so you know, I'm absolutely fine
with going to this family dinner.

1246
01:02:22,128 --> 01:02:23,687
They're going to love you.

1247
01:02:24,688 --> 01:02:26,759
This is delicious!

1248
01:02:28,608 --> 01:02:29,608
So...

1249
01:02:30,248 --> 01:02:31,809
How long
have you and Linda been dating?

1250
01:02:32,168 --> 01:02:33,168
Mother.

1251
01:02:34,288 --> 01:02:36,359
No, it's all right. It's
a logical question.

1252
01:02:37,928 --> 01:02:42,002
Ours is a new love,
but it burns very brightly.

1253
01:02:42,968 --> 01:02:46,678
And it gets hot and sweaty and stanky.

1254
01:02:46,808 --> 01:02:49,118
There's some stank on that love.

1255
01:02:49,488 --> 01:02:50,763
What are you talking about?

1256
01:02:50,968 --> 01:02:53,199
We been rockin' that headboard
every night.

1257
01:02:53,328 --> 01:02:56,002
Am I right? Say what?

1258
01:02:56,128 --> 01:02:58,688
Now, we don't have
conversations like that over dinner.

1259
01:02:58,808 --> 01:03:02,563
I'm just saying
I'm knocking those boots 24/7, my man.

1260
01:03:03,368 --> 01:03:04,643
Give it to me.

1261
01:03:05,128 --> 01:03:06,244
Put your hand down.

1262
01:03:06,408 --> 01:03:07,408
Ron, what are you doing?

1263
01:03:07,488 --> 01:03:10,208
I'm addressing
the white elephant in the room.

1264
01:03:10,328 --> 01:03:13,207
I'm breaking down the barriers
of race by assimilation.

1265
01:03:13,328 --> 01:03:15,479
- That's all I'm doing.
- Well, you're coming off like a jerk.

1266
01:03:15,728 --> 01:03:17,208
I think it's going well.

1267
01:03:17,328 --> 01:03:20,002
I understand you're
making quite an impact at the station.

1268
01:03:20,248 --> 01:03:21,887
All I've done is tried my best.

1269
01:03:22,208 --> 01:03:24,928
I walk around that office, I'm lookin' fly,

1270
01:03:25,528 --> 01:03:26,598
and the first thing I did,

1271
01:03:26,728 --> 01:03:29,929
I walk through those doors, and I walk
right up to that white devil boss and say,

1272
01:03:30,008 --> 01:03:32,807
"Hey, boss man! Hey, boss man!
I'm talkin' to you!

1273
01:03:33,048 --> 01:03:34,846
"You gots to pay me!
Where's my paper?

1274
01:03:34,968 --> 01:03:36,687
"You gots to pay me in paper!"

1275
01:03:36,848 --> 01:03:39,761
If you haven't noticed,
we don't converse like that.

1276
01:03:39,888 --> 01:03:41,641
Okay, okay.

1277
01:03:41,968 --> 01:03:43,607
Look at big papa down here.

1278
01:03:43,768 --> 01:03:45,885
He's saying to himself,
"Shit! Look at this honky.

1279
01:03:46,008 --> 01:03:51,288
"Sittin' at my table, eatin' all my food.
Drinking my Ripple! What?"

1280
01:03:51,488 --> 01:03:52,968
Oh, my goodness!

1281
01:03:53,168 --> 01:03:56,002
"I'm gonna sic that pit bull on him.
Hey, Cujo, get in here!"

1282
01:03:56,128 --> 01:03:58,962
Linda, I don't understand
what you are doing with him.

1283
01:03:59,128 --> 01:04:02,439
You know what I'm comin' at you with,
you big black mother of Linda.

1284
01:04:02,568 --> 01:04:04,082
Mix it up in a pot!

1285
01:04:04,208 --> 01:04:06,598
- Makin' it spicy!
- Oh, my Lord.

1286
01:04:06,728 --> 01:04:09,323
- Hey. That's my mama, man.
- Please, don't do this.

1287
01:04:09,928 --> 01:04:12,124
Now, which one of you
pipe-hittin' bitches

1288
01:04:12,248 --> 01:04:13,528
can pass me the mashed potatoes?

1289
01:04:14,344 --> 01:04:16,344
I don't think
that dinner could've gone any better.

1290
01:04:16,368 --> 01:04:17,404
Are you nuts?

1291
01:04:17,768 --> 01:04:20,158
No, I'm not! I had a wonderful evening!

1292
01:04:20,848 --> 01:04:22,521
My dad was kicking you in the head!

1293
01:04:22,648 --> 01:04:26,881
I hate to pin it on you,
but you did invite me to dinner.

1294
01:04:27,008 --> 01:04:28,727
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1295
01:04:28,848 --> 01:04:30,328
- No, I'm sorry.
- I just...

1296
01:04:30,728 --> 01:04:34,119
I'm just under a lot of stress
because Allenby,

1297
01:04:34,248 --> 01:04:37,207
he doesn't want you to do
the story that you're doing for sweeps.

1298
01:04:37,768 --> 01:04:38,768
"Death From Above."

1299
01:04:38,848 --> 01:04:40,488
It's an excellent story.
Wonderful exposé.

1300
01:04:40,528 --> 01:04:42,087
Listen, Ron.

1301
01:04:43,208 --> 01:04:45,086
Have you ever heard of synergy?

1302
01:04:50,888 --> 01:04:54,882
So your mom thought we should
get together, spend a little time.

1303
01:04:55,808 --> 01:04:59,245
She doesn't think
I connect with you as a child.

1304
01:05:00,608 --> 01:05:02,679
Can you believe that bullshit?

1305
01:05:04,208 --> 01:05:05,801
Dad.

1306
01:05:06,168 --> 01:05:09,286
Sometimes I hear sounds at night
and I get scared.

1307
01:05:09,408 --> 01:05:12,048
I think there's a ghost in my closet.

1308
01:05:13,728 --> 01:05:15,321
Now, you listen to me, son.

1309
01:05:15,448 --> 01:05:19,237
There is no such thing as ghosts.
Case closed.

1310
01:05:19,368 --> 01:05:21,041
So what's real that's scary?

1311
01:05:21,168 --> 01:05:24,081
You really want to know
the one thing you should be afraid of?

1312
01:05:24,368 --> 01:05:25,882
Yes, I really do.

1313
01:05:26,368 --> 01:05:27,368
Voodoo.

1314
01:05:27,488 --> 01:05:29,480
- Voodoo?
- Yes, voodoo.

1315
01:05:29,608 --> 01:05:31,406
That shit will mess you up.

1316
01:05:31,648 --> 01:05:34,163
And it is 100% real.

1317
01:05:34,448 --> 01:05:37,327
Promise me that you'll never go to Haiti.

1318
01:05:37,728 --> 01:05:39,128
I promise, Dad.

1319
01:05:39,328 --> 01:05:41,320
This was good.
I enjoyed spending time with you.

1320
01:05:41,528 --> 01:05:42,528
Me, too, Dad.

1321
01:05:42,728 --> 01:05:44,845
And hey.
Do you want to go to Haiti sometime?

1322
01:05:45,088 --> 01:05:46,841
- No.
- Good. Good.

1323
01:05:47,088 --> 01:05:48,807
What did you tell him?

1324
01:05:48,968 --> 01:05:50,402
I didn't tell him anything.

1325
01:05:50,648 --> 01:05:52,685
He hasn't slept for four days, Ron!

1326
01:05:52,928 --> 01:05:55,727
Everywhere we go,
he asks me if we're going to Haiti!

1327
01:05:55,848 --> 01:05:56,884
What does that even mean?

1328
01:05:57,048 --> 01:06:01,679
I am so sick and tired that you've
sheltered him from the evils of voodoo.

1329
01:06:01,888 --> 01:06:04,562
You need to learn to
connect with him in a healthy way!

1330
01:06:04,688 --> 01:06:06,645
Let me ask you something,
and I'm not trying to be funny here.

1331
01:06:06,768 --> 01:06:09,203
Are you sure he's not a midget
with a learning disability?

1332
01:06:09,488 --> 01:06:12,322
He is seven years old, Ron.

1333
01:06:12,568 --> 01:06:14,002
- All right.
<i>- Now listen to me.</i>

1334
01:06:14,208 --> 01:06:18,919
He has a science fair tomorrow, at 8:00,
and he wants you to be there.

1335
01:06:19,128 --> 01:06:21,563
I will be there. All right?

1336
01:06:21,768 --> 01:06:23,208
Now, who do you have
for sweeps week?

1337
01:06:23,248 --> 01:06:25,285
I'm not discussing work with you,
Ron, okay?

1338
01:06:25,408 --> 01:06:27,923
Just be there
at the science fair tomorrow.

1339
01:06:28,048 --> 01:06:29,048
Fine!

1340
01:06:29,984 --> 01:06:32,064
<i>Well, they're calling it</i>
<i>the interview of the decade.</i>

1341
01:06:32,088 --> 01:06:34,398
<i>Veronica Corningstone</i>
<i>will sit down with Yasser Arafat.</i>

1342
01:06:34,768 --> 01:06:35,768
Yasser who?

1343
01:06:35,848 --> 01:06:38,283
<i>The head of the PLO and some say</i>
<i>the key to peace in the Middle East.</i>

1344
01:06:38,448 --> 01:06:41,805
<i>Of course, Ms Corningstone</i>
<i>is the ex-wife of Ron Burgundy,</i>

1345
01:06:42,328 --> 01:06:44,529
<i>so you know that's got to be</i>
<i>a little stinger for Ronny.</i>

1346
01:06:44,688 --> 01:06:46,202
Pay him no mind, Ron.

1347
01:06:46,328 --> 01:06:49,082
<i>Thank you for watching GNN.</i>
<i>I'm Jack Lame.</i>

1348
01:06:50,408 --> 01:06:52,001
He's still saying it.

1349
01:06:52,128 --> 01:06:55,439
We're going to get crushed in ratings.
Just crushed.

1350
01:06:55,888 --> 01:06:58,005
I really thought
we had a chance this time.

1351
01:06:58,208 --> 01:07:00,404
What about my
"Death From Above" story?

1352
01:07:01,688 --> 01:07:04,203
You better ask Ron about that.

1353
01:07:05,128 --> 01:07:06,482
We're pulling that story, Brian.

1354
01:07:06,648 --> 01:07:09,322
What? Why?
I worked hard on that story.

1355
01:07:09,448 --> 01:07:12,646
It was my call, all right, Brian?
Just let it go. It's synergy.

1356
01:07:12,768 --> 01:07:13,768
What does that mean?

1357
01:07:13,888 --> 01:07:15,368
Take it easy, Ron.

1358
01:07:15,488 --> 01:07:16,922
We got further
than anybody thought we would.

1359
01:07:17,048 --> 01:07:18,048
We'll get 'em next time.

1360
01:07:18,128 --> 01:07:21,007
You take it easy!
I'm not in this to finish second!

1361
01:07:21,168 --> 01:07:22,648
I think Champ is just saying...

1362
01:07:22,768 --> 01:07:25,886
I know what he was trying to say,
Brian, okay?

1363
01:07:26,008 --> 01:07:28,648
And it doesn't surprise me
that you guys don't care.

1364
01:07:28,768 --> 01:07:31,203
Let's face it,
I'm the one who gets the ratings.

1365
01:07:32,008 --> 01:07:34,239
I'm starting to wonder
what you clowns actually do.

1366
01:07:35,008 --> 01:07:37,762
Chani likes clowns.
Except for the scary ones.

1367
01:07:37,928 --> 01:07:38,928
Shut up, Brick!

1368
01:07:39,448 --> 01:07:41,326
Just shut up for once!

1369
01:07:42,128 --> 01:07:45,121
Ron yelled at me.

1370
01:07:45,248 --> 01:07:46,609
You're damn right I yelled at you!

1371
01:07:50,328 --> 01:07:52,081
You don't yell at Brick.

1372
01:07:52,568 --> 01:07:53,968
Are you still smoking crack?

1373
01:07:54,368 --> 01:07:55,643
No.

1374
01:07:56,128 --> 01:07:58,120
I only smoked that one time.

1375
01:07:58,648 --> 01:08:01,720
That's a lie. I've done it six more times.

1376
01:08:01,928 --> 01:08:03,157
You made Brick cry.

1377
01:08:04,808 --> 01:08:07,084
You've gone ratings crazy, Ron.

1378
01:08:07,208 --> 01:08:08,278
You know what, Ron?

1379
01:08:08,928 --> 01:08:11,045
We're a news team,
and that's a bond for life.

1380
01:08:11,168 --> 01:08:12,887
But I don't like the man you've become.

1381
01:08:13,008 --> 01:08:15,648
We were happy when you found us.
Right?

1382
01:08:15,768 --> 01:08:17,725
I was taking pictures of pussies,

1383
01:08:17,848 --> 01:08:20,886
Champ was serving bats to people,
and Brick was dead.

1384
01:08:21,008 --> 01:08:22,601
We took a chance
and followed you here.

1385
01:08:22,728 --> 01:08:25,004
But you know what? I'm starting to
realise, it was all about you,

1386
01:08:25,128 --> 01:08:27,359
and beating Veronica
no matter what the cost.

1387
01:08:27,488 --> 01:08:30,401
It wasn't about news.
It wasn't about the team.

1388
01:08:30,528 --> 01:08:31,968
It definitely wasn't about your son.

1389
01:08:32,048 --> 01:08:33,048
Yeah!

1390
01:08:33,168 --> 01:08:35,444
You'll have to excuse me, Brian.

1391
01:08:36,128 --> 01:08:41,601
I've got a sore back from carrying
your ass around for the last 15 years.

1392
01:08:42,528 --> 01:08:43,803
You know what, Burgundy?

1393
01:08:44,248 --> 01:08:47,082
I think your mouth
is writing checks that your body isn't...

1394
01:08:47,208 --> 01:08:49,245
Can't even... Do anything with.

1395
01:08:55,408 --> 01:08:58,003
Fine, go! I don't need you!

1396
01:08:58,648 --> 01:09:00,719
I'll do the news by myself!

1397
01:09:05,368 --> 01:09:08,088
<i>Tonight I interview Yasser Arafat...</i>

1398
01:09:08,248 --> 01:09:10,409
- This is terrible.
<i>- ...the secretive head of the PLO.</i>

1399
01:09:10,808 --> 01:09:12,800
- We're on in 20, Ron, 20.
- All right.

1400
01:09:13,528 --> 01:09:14,528
You ready?

1401
01:09:15,088 --> 01:09:16,488
What's that?

1402
01:09:16,888 --> 01:09:17,888
That's nothing.

1403
01:09:18,008 --> 01:09:21,285
It's just a car chase
on the satellite feed from Milwaukee.

1404
01:09:22,408 --> 01:09:23,728
You know what?

1405
01:09:24,168 --> 01:09:26,478
Give it to me live to start the broadcast.

1406
01:09:26,608 --> 01:09:28,964
No. That's not news, Ron.

1407
01:09:29,168 --> 01:09:30,966
Give it to me live, okay?

1408
01:09:31,088 --> 01:09:32,442
And don't question me again.

1409
01:09:32,568 --> 01:09:33,568
Bill!

1410
01:09:33,648 --> 01:09:35,879
<i>- Now to you, the modern viewer...</i>
- Here we go.

1411
01:09:36,008 --> 01:09:38,398
<i>...reporting on a car chase</i>
<i>may seem commonplace...</i>

1412
01:09:38,528 --> 01:09:41,680
- Three, two...
<i>- ...but in 1980, it was unheard of.</i>

1413
01:09:41,808 --> 01:09:45,688
Good evening. I'm Ron Burgundy,
reporting live from New York.

1414
01:09:45,808 --> 01:09:49,165
We have breaking news
developing in our nation's heartland.

1415
01:09:49,288 --> 01:09:52,725
A high-speed car chase is in progress...

1416
01:09:52,848 --> 01:09:55,158
Keep the "Breaking News" logo.
Keep up the graphics.

1417
01:09:55,288 --> 01:09:56,244
Reaching speeds of 100 miles per hour.

1418
01:09:56,408 --> 01:10:00,084
And for the first time in news history,
we will stay with it live

1419
01:10:00,208 --> 01:10:03,565
<i>until it resolves in either</i>
<i>a huge accident or a massive shootout.</i>

1420
01:10:03,688 --> 01:10:04,688
Richard!

1421
01:10:04,728 --> 01:10:07,562
Hurry. Get in here!
There's a car chase on the news!

1422
01:10:08,728 --> 01:10:10,606
When is Dad gonna be here?

1423
01:10:10,728 --> 01:10:11,878
He'll be here.

1424
01:10:12,368 --> 01:10:13,404
Are you a little upset?

1425
01:10:13,528 --> 01:10:18,523
Do you want to do that thing where
we sort of talk about our feelings?

1426
01:10:18,688 --> 01:10:20,600
- Oh, God, no.
- Okay.

1427
01:10:20,768 --> 01:10:24,478
This is the pulse of what's going on
in our country right now.

1428
01:10:24,768 --> 01:10:25,963
Freddie, what's going on?

1429
01:10:26,088 --> 01:10:28,000
Why is there
a local car chase on the TV?

1430
01:10:28,128 --> 01:10:29,528
It's Burgundy. He insisted!

1431
01:10:29,728 --> 01:10:31,367
Can't you see what
the son of a bitch is doing?

1432
01:10:31,488 --> 01:10:33,049
We didn't have a story, so he made one.

1433
01:10:33,128 --> 01:10:34,482
You can't do that!

1434
01:10:34,808 --> 01:10:36,561
Tell Ron to speculate
who's driving the car.

1435
01:10:36,728 --> 01:10:39,482
Ron, speculate on who's driving the car.

1436
01:10:39,808 --> 01:10:43,404
We believe the driver may be on drugs.

1437
01:10:43,528 --> 01:10:45,918
<i>He's probably 6'7", 6'8".</i>

1438
01:10:46,048 --> 01:10:48,438
But a skinny 6'7", 6'8". About 160.

1439
01:10:48,648 --> 01:10:50,719
He may have a hostage or two.

1440
01:10:50,848 --> 01:10:52,805
We don't know. He could have...

1441
01:10:52,928 --> 01:10:55,602
The phone lines are lighting up.
It's about the chase!

1442
01:10:55,728 --> 01:10:57,049
I've never seen anything like it!

1443
01:10:57,368 --> 01:11:00,406
Mr Arafat, is there any scenario

1444
01:11:00,528 --> 01:11:02,804
by which peace
could be reached with Israel?

1445
01:11:02,928 --> 01:11:05,045
Peace is what burns in my heart.
I am committed to...

1446
01:11:05,208 --> 01:11:06,208
What was... Excuse me.

1447
01:11:06,808 --> 01:11:08,242
What happened to the...

1448
01:11:08,368 --> 01:11:10,088
The network cut to
another developing story.

1449
01:11:10,208 --> 01:11:12,006
Some kind of crazy car chase.

1450
01:11:12,128 --> 01:11:14,006
Who covers a car chase?

1451
01:11:14,248 --> 01:11:17,844
I am sitting here with the most important
interview of my entire career,

1452
01:11:17,968 --> 01:11:19,402
and they're cutting to a car chase?

1453
01:11:19,528 --> 01:11:21,087
I would like to watch the car chase.

1454
01:11:21,208 --> 01:11:22,358
You need to shut your mouth.

1455
01:11:22,528 --> 01:11:23,723
<i>This is extremely gripping.</i>

1456
01:11:23,848 --> 01:11:26,363
<i>He just hit a car! He just hit a car!</i>

1457
01:11:26,464 --> 01:11:27,704
He hit a car! Did you see that?

1458
01:11:27,728 --> 01:11:28,728
He hit a car!

1459
01:11:29,808 --> 01:11:31,169
- He hit the car!
- He hit the car!

1460
01:11:31,288 --> 01:11:33,166
When did the news get awesome?

1461
01:11:34,088 --> 01:11:35,920
<i>And he just loses it!</i>

1462
01:11:36,048 --> 01:11:38,847
That's exactly what we needed.
It was getting a little boring...

1463
01:11:42,208 --> 01:11:44,404
Hey. You did a great job.

1464
01:11:44,568 --> 01:11:46,321
Thanks, Gary.

1465
01:11:46,568 --> 01:11:47,922
I don't think your dad's coming.

1466
01:11:48,048 --> 01:11:49,801
I'm sorry, honey,
but I think we need to go.

1467
01:11:51,368 --> 01:11:53,405
Stop reading my mind!

1468
01:11:54,048 --> 01:11:55,198
All right.

1469
01:11:59,248 --> 01:12:01,080
I mean, this is what I worry about.

1470
01:12:02,768 --> 01:12:05,886
- Did you do that with your mind?
- No.

1471
01:12:06,008 --> 01:12:07,078
Liar.

1472
01:12:07,328 --> 01:12:11,163
We're just getting word that police
have finally apprehended the suspect.

1473
01:12:11,688 --> 01:12:16,126
It turns out that he is
an elderly gentleman, he's 80 years old,

1474
01:12:16,248 --> 01:12:18,080
- and he was simply confused.
- Unbelievable.

1475
01:12:18,288 --> 01:12:19,438
I'm Ron Burgundy.

1476
01:12:19,888 --> 01:12:23,882
Don't just have a great night,
have an American night.

1477
01:12:25,648 --> 01:12:27,287
And we are clear!

1478
01:12:27,608 --> 01:12:28,608
Yes!

1479
01:12:29,088 --> 01:12:30,088
Great!

1480
01:12:30,168 --> 01:12:31,238
All right!

1481
01:12:31,528 --> 01:12:33,360
I don't believe it! You did it, Ron!

1482
01:12:33,528 --> 01:12:35,679
Oh, my goodness. Thanks, Freddie.

1483
01:12:36,768 --> 01:12:38,282
I don't deserve this.

1484
01:12:38,488 --> 01:12:40,366
It was a team effort. It really was.

1485
01:12:48,928 --> 01:12:50,442
<i>Now, ladies and gentlemen,</i>

1486
01:12:50,888 --> 01:12:55,121
<i>we all know there's one reason</i>
<i>that GNN has gotten to the top.</i>

1487
01:12:55,728 --> 01:12:59,119
<i>And that reason is the greatest</i>
<i>bloody newsman in the world.</i>

1488
01:12:59,248 --> 01:13:00,682
<i>Long may he reign!</i>

1489
01:13:00,968 --> 01:13:01,968
<i>Mr Ron Burgundy!</i>

1490
01:13:02,768 --> 01:13:04,919
Yeah, Ron! Yeah!

1491
01:13:12,768 --> 01:13:14,327
Fire it up, Ronny!

1492
01:13:37,328 --> 01:13:38,444
Let's blaze.

1493
01:13:38,568 --> 01:13:41,083
Yeah. To hell with Ron Burgundy.

1494
01:13:42,408 --> 01:13:44,286
We did it, my onyx hellion.

1495
01:13:46,688 --> 01:13:47,688
You're magic!

1496
01:13:49,928 --> 01:13:52,079
Ron, you should see what you're doing!

1497
01:14:07,848 --> 01:14:09,567
<i>In the myth of Icarus,</i>

1498
01:14:09,848 --> 01:14:13,683
<i>Icarus, full of the folly</i>
<i>that comes with pride, flew too high</i>

1499
01:14:13,808 --> 01:14:15,162
<i>and the sun melted his wings.</i>

1500
01:14:16,768 --> 01:14:20,478
<i>Burgundy's fame was bigger</i>
<i>than he ever imagined.</i>

1501
01:14:21,128 --> 01:14:23,085
<i>And the fall was dizzying.</i>

1502
01:14:31,128 --> 01:14:32,528
Oh, my God, Ronny!

1503
01:14:32,928 --> 01:14:33,964
Ron!

1504
01:14:34,288 --> 01:14:35,927
- Open the bloody gate.
- Will somebody call an ambulance?

1505
01:14:36,048 --> 01:14:38,199
Do not die in front of us!

1506
01:14:39,168 --> 01:14:41,683
Do not die in front of us!

1507
01:14:43,608 --> 01:14:45,122
Stay classy, Ron Burgundy.

1508
01:14:45,248 --> 01:14:47,001
Somebody call an ambulance!

1509
01:14:58,248 --> 01:14:59,807
Damn it, Milton, what is it?

1510
01:14:59,928 --> 01:15:01,328
Well, Ron...

1511
01:15:03,288 --> 01:15:05,598
It looks as if both optic nerves

1512
01:15:05,728 --> 01:15:08,288
are separated from
their respective corneas.

1513
01:15:08,888 --> 01:15:10,845
- What?
- No other way to put this, but...

1514
01:15:11,288 --> 01:15:12,288
You're blind.

1515
01:15:12,368 --> 01:15:14,564
Milton, I'm an anchorman.

1516
01:15:14,688 --> 01:15:18,159
I read the news off the teleprompter.
It's what I do!

1517
01:15:18,648 --> 01:15:19,877
How will I live?

1518
01:15:20,088 --> 01:15:22,648
I'm no career counsellor,
but there are many things you can do.

1519
01:15:23,048 --> 01:15:24,926
Be an oracle, or a mystic.

1520
01:15:25,128 --> 01:15:26,608
Clearly, there must be something

1521
01:15:26,728 --> 01:15:29,800
in this new-fangled office
of yours that can help me!

1522
01:15:29,928 --> 01:15:31,601
- Settle down.
- There's got to be something in here!

1523
01:15:31,728 --> 01:15:32,728
Settle down!

1524
01:15:33,448 --> 01:15:35,201
Zombies! Zombies!

1525
01:15:37,488 --> 01:15:40,083
If you get my hands on me, I'll kill you.

1526
01:15:41,128 --> 01:15:42,608
<i>The world of the blind.</i>

1527
01:15:42,728 --> 01:15:46,608
<i>Ron Burgundy, a man who had</i>
<i>flourished in a visual medium,</i>

1528
01:15:46,728 --> 01:15:49,880
<i>had forever entered</i>

1529
01:15:50,168 --> 01:15:53,127
<i>Always lonely</i>

1530
01:15:53,528 --> 01:15:55,679
<i>Always looking</i>

1531
01:15:57,168 --> 01:16:01,685
<i>To get even with the men</i>
<i>who did him wrong</i>

1532
01:16:04,128 --> 01:16:05,926
<i>That was Billy</i>

1533

Who is it?

1534
01:16:11,528 --> 01:16:13,281
Ron, it's us!

1535
01:16:13,408 --> 01:16:16,526
I'm sure you gentlemen
are famished from your travels.

1536
01:16:16,648 --> 01:16:20,119
I hope you like Triscuits
and some pimento loaf.

1537
01:16:20,448 --> 01:16:22,405
Still hot off the griddle!

1538
01:16:22,728 --> 01:16:23,844
There we go.

1539
01:16:24,368 --> 01:16:26,519
Well, everyone at the station
really misses you, Ron.

1540
01:16:27,368 --> 01:16:29,803
Jack Lime's been filling in for you
since you've been gone.

1541
01:16:30,328 --> 01:16:32,328
You know, he's really not
such a bad guy after all.

1542
01:16:33,688 --> 01:16:35,407
He goes by Jack Lamé now.

1543
01:16:35,528 --> 01:16:37,201
Well, he shouldn't be doing that.

1544
01:16:37,328 --> 01:16:38,887
He should be going by Jack Lame.

1545
01:16:39,328 --> 01:16:40,328
Brick!

1546
01:16:40,368 --> 01:16:41,368
Brick.

1547
01:16:41,688 --> 01:16:43,645
That's checkers and caulk.
Don't eat that.

1548
01:16:44,808 --> 01:16:46,401
What about Linda? She hasn't called.

1549
01:16:46,528 --> 01:16:47,678
Linda's pretty busy.

1550
01:16:48,168 --> 01:16:50,364
Ron, I'm going to need your recipe.

1551
01:16:50,528 --> 01:16:52,042
So, Ron, what do you do
with yourself all day?

1552
01:16:52,168 --> 01:16:53,841
You're just out here pretty
much away from everything.

1553
01:16:53,968 --> 01:16:56,005
Well, every day begins about the same.

1554
01:16:56,448 --> 01:16:58,440
I wake up screaming in terror

1555
01:16:58,568 --> 01:17:00,369
because of the blackness
and I think I'm dead.

1556
01:17:00,448 --> 01:17:01,448
Every day?

1557
01:17:01,568 --> 01:17:03,127
Yes! Every day!

1558
01:17:03,328 --> 01:17:06,287
And then I begin what's called
The Great Adventure.

1559
01:17:06,528 --> 01:17:08,087
Making breakfast.

1560
01:17:08,328 --> 01:17:10,718
I've eaten everything
from nails to drink coasters.

1561
01:17:10,928 --> 01:17:13,363
One time I bit hard
into a marble ashtray,

1562
01:17:13,488 --> 01:17:15,241
thinking it was a savoury waffle.

1563
01:17:15,528 --> 01:17:19,647
I wanted that waffle so bad!
Completely shattered my teeth.

1564
01:17:19,768 --> 01:17:21,999
Couldn't you tell
the ashtray wasn't hot like a waffle?

1565
01:17:22,128 --> 01:17:24,404
No! I couldn't! Because I'm blind!

1566
01:17:24,728 --> 01:17:28,324
I'm not blind
23 hours a day or 22 hours a day,

1567
01:17:28,448 --> 01:17:31,247
I'm blind the whole goddamn time!

1568
01:17:31,368 --> 01:17:34,406
Do you have any idea what it's like
to drink a half a bottle of ketchup

1569
01:17:34,528 --> 01:17:38,124
thinking it was a bottle of
1946 Châteauneuf-du-Pape?

1570
01:17:39,648 --> 01:17:40,843
I even decanted it!

1571
01:17:41,088 --> 01:17:44,047
If you drank half a bottle
of that, that's like...

1572
01:17:44,328 --> 01:17:45,762
That's like nine or 10 gulps.

1573
01:17:45,888 --> 01:17:47,402
I mean, you couldn't tell
that was ketchup?

1574
01:17:47,528 --> 01:17:48,803
Did I stutter?

1575
01:17:48,928 --> 01:17:51,762
I'm ba-lind!

1576
01:17:51,888 --> 01:17:53,561
You're having a tough time, Ron, I know.

1577
01:17:53,808 --> 01:17:55,401
You know what the biggest indignity is?

1578
01:17:56,168 --> 01:17:57,568
I can't even masturbate!

1579
01:17:57,688 --> 01:18:00,567
- Why?
- Heck, one morning, I spent 20 minutes

1580
01:18:00,728 --> 01:18:05,200
aggressively rubbing my shin,
wondering, "Where's the sensation?

1581
01:18:05,328 --> 01:18:06,603
"When's the pleasure coming?"

1582
01:18:06,728 --> 01:18:08,685
You rubbed your shin
thinking it was a penis?

1583
01:18:08,808 --> 01:18:10,765
- I know you think I'm stupid, don't you?
- No!

1584
01:18:10,888 --> 01:18:13,164
The weirdo who lives
in the weird lighthouse

1585
01:18:13,288 --> 01:18:14,438
in the middle of nowhere.

1586
01:18:14,568 --> 01:18:16,799
Ron, it was your choice to
live in a "weird lighthouse."

1587
01:18:16,928 --> 01:18:18,078
You know why I live here?

1588
01:18:18,408 --> 01:18:22,038
Let me say it real slow and real loud.

1589
01:18:22,848 --> 01:18:24,567
I'm

1590
01:18:24,688 --> 01:18:27,203
blind!

1591
01:18:28,208 --> 01:18:29,608
I guess we should get out of here.

1592
01:18:29,728 --> 01:18:31,082
Maybe you should go. Yes.

1593
01:18:31,528 --> 01:18:33,042
Why don't you guys get out of here!

1594
01:18:33,528 --> 01:18:35,884
Despite my complete and utter isolation,

1595
01:18:36,008 --> 01:18:38,967
your gentlemen's visit
has actually made it worse!

1596
01:18:46,368 --> 01:18:47,688
Goodbye, Ron.

1597
01:18:49,888 --> 01:18:50,888
What?

1598
01:18:51,768 --> 01:18:52,804
No, don't go!

1599
01:18:53,208 --> 01:18:57,122
Please! Wait! I'm all alone! Come back!

1600
01:19:01,928 --> 01:19:04,318
Wait! Come back!

1601
01:19:05,248 --> 01:19:06,887
Come back!

1602
01:19:10,008 --> 01:19:11,442
I'm alone!

1603
01:19:12,328 --> 01:19:15,924
Why have you
done this to me, God? Why?

1604
01:19:16,728 --> 01:19:20,199
Couldn't you have cured a sick
child or created a new animal?

1605
01:19:20,528 --> 01:19:24,078
But, no, you had to
make Ron Burgundy blind!

1606
01:19:25,264 --> 01:19:26,784
Well, I never thought that I would see

1607
01:19:26,808 --> 01:19:30,165
the Ron Burgundy
full of so much self-pity.

1608
01:19:30,288 --> 01:19:32,883
Who is it? What is that noise?

1609
01:19:33,248 --> 01:19:34,248
Take my hand.

1610
01:19:34,928 --> 01:19:36,123
I can't see it!

1611
01:19:36,248 --> 01:19:37,364
Reach for it, Ron!

1612
01:19:37,888 --> 01:19:40,039
You have to learn to do for yourself now.

1613
01:19:40,888 --> 01:19:42,607
All right. This... Okay. Here we go.

1614
01:19:42,728 --> 01:19:43,923
Get up. There we go.

1615
01:19:46,528 --> 01:19:47,882
Cher, is that you?

1616
01:19:48,008 --> 01:19:49,522
You can't recognise me by my voice?

1617
01:19:49,968 --> 01:19:52,927
Every news station
is copying what you did, Ron.

1618
01:19:53,048 --> 01:19:57,486
All the stories are about animals,
or car chases or strip clubs.

1619
01:19:57,808 --> 01:20:00,084
The genie has been let out of the bottle,

1620
01:20:00,608 --> 01:20:02,679
and old Ron Burgundy popped the cork.

1621
01:20:02,888 --> 01:20:05,278
- That's why I quit <i>WBC News.</i>
- What?

1622
01:20:05,448 --> 01:20:07,565
There's no real news
being reported out there.

1623
01:20:07,688 --> 01:20:08,883
It's just all about ratings.

1624
01:20:09,248 --> 01:20:10,477
Veronica.

1625
01:20:11,048 --> 01:20:12,243
Why are you here?

1626
01:20:12,368 --> 01:20:14,007
I'm here for our son, Ron.

1627
01:20:14,328 --> 01:20:15,648
Walter needs you.

1628
01:20:15,768 --> 01:20:19,444
I need you to start taking responsibility
for him and for yourself.

1629
01:20:19,568 --> 01:20:21,321
Do you realise you're talking to a man

1630
01:20:21,448 --> 01:20:25,078
who just this morning tried
to brush his teeth with a live lobster?

1631
01:20:25,328 --> 01:20:26,398
What?

1632
01:20:27,384 --> 01:20:29,424
You would've
known the second that you touched it...

1633
01:20:29,448 --> 01:20:32,282
I'm just saying it's not
going to be a cakewalk.

1634
01:20:32,688 --> 01:20:34,884
Well, then we best get to it.

1635
01:20:35,488 --> 01:20:36,524
Now, drink your tea.

1636
01:20:40,688 --> 01:20:44,045
- Let me get a sponge. I'll get it.
- All right. No, no, just stay there.

1637
01:20:44,248 --> 01:20:46,080
I'll have it cleaned up in a jiffy.

1638
01:20:52,768 --> 01:20:54,487
Just remember the curves.

1639
01:20:54,608 --> 01:20:55,608
The curves.

1640
01:20:55,688 --> 01:20:57,600
- The green eyes.
- Green eyes.

1641
01:20:57,768 --> 01:20:59,566
You have to use your other senses now!

1642
01:20:59,928 --> 01:21:01,078
I can't do it!

1643
01:21:10,088 --> 01:21:11,088
Let's try this again.

1644
01:21:11,128 --> 01:21:13,085
- Did you throw it?
- Yes, I threw it.

1645
01:21:27,488 --> 01:21:29,957
It's just a bunch of crazy lines, isn't it?

1646
01:21:30,088 --> 01:21:32,683
No. It's beautiful.

1647
01:21:34,168 --> 01:21:35,727
It's beautiful.

1648
01:21:49,888 --> 01:21:51,447
What about Gary?

1649
01:21:51,568 --> 01:21:53,127
We split up two weeks ago.

1650
01:21:53,368 --> 01:21:56,167
He was too emotionally stable.
It was so annoying!

1651
01:21:58,928 --> 01:22:00,123
You did it!

1652
01:22:03,528 --> 01:22:09,047
"But sometimes a shark's got to do
what a shark's got to do."

1653
01:22:10,528 --> 01:22:12,884
That last part
doesn't make any sense at all.

1654
01:22:13,008 --> 01:22:14,840
The rest of the book is very enjoyable.

1655
01:22:14,968 --> 01:22:17,608
Promise you won't leave again.

1656
01:22:17,728 --> 01:22:21,768
If I tell you I'll be there,
I swear I'll be there.

1657
01:22:21,888 --> 01:22:24,005
That makes me so happy.

1658
01:22:25,008 --> 01:22:27,887
It makes me happy, too, son.

1659
01:22:28,008 --> 01:22:32,048
Now read the part again where
he orders a pepperoni pizza with kelp.

1660
01:22:42,528 --> 01:22:43,528
Hey.

1661
01:22:43,568 --> 01:22:46,800
I found the most beautiful
clams down by the estuary.

1662
01:22:46,928 --> 01:22:48,840
I thought we could steam
them up tonight

1663
01:22:48,968 --> 01:22:51,039
with a nice butter sauce

1664
01:22:51,448 --> 01:22:52,882
and some wine.

1665
01:22:54,568 --> 01:22:55,568
Veronica.

1666
01:22:55,848 --> 01:22:57,043
Yes, Ron?

1667
01:22:57,928 --> 01:22:59,328
Can you explain this?

1668
01:23:02,248 --> 01:23:05,241
<i>Ron, this is Dr Brangley.</i>
<i>I've left dozens of messages.</i>

1669
01:23:05,368 --> 01:23:07,041
<i>Somehow, they must be getting erased.</i>

1670
01:23:07,168 --> 01:23:11,082
<i>But there is a procedure</i>
<i>that can possibly return your sight.</i>

1671
01:23:11,528 --> 01:23:13,963
<i>Please get back to me</i>
<i>if you're interested.</i>

1672
01:23:14,328 --> 01:23:17,446
Well? Have you been
erasing these messages?

1673
01:23:17,648 --> 01:23:20,208
Yes. Ron, just let me explain.

1674
01:23:20,328 --> 01:23:21,328
How could you?

1675
01:23:21,448 --> 01:23:24,088
We've never been this happy,
and I just thought that...

1676
01:23:24,208 --> 01:23:25,801
Thought that if I could see again,

1677
01:23:25,928 --> 01:23:28,079
that somehow I couldn't
love you and Walter anymore?

1678
01:23:28,248 --> 01:23:29,248
Yes!

1679
01:23:29,768 --> 01:23:33,648
Damn you, woman! You lied to me!

1680
01:23:34,608 --> 01:23:36,247
I gave you everything!

1681
01:23:36,408 --> 01:23:39,446
I gave you my heart, my smile,

1682
01:23:40,488 --> 01:23:41,638
my seed.

1683
01:23:42,328 --> 01:23:43,478
And you lied to me.

1684
01:23:43,648 --> 01:23:44,877
- Dad!
- Sweetheart.

1685
01:23:45,008 --> 01:23:46,408
No! Dad!

1686
01:23:46,688 --> 01:23:48,281
Don't leave, Dad!

1687
01:23:48,928 --> 01:23:50,203
- Dad!
- Walter, just...

1688
01:23:50,688 --> 01:23:52,407
Sweetheart, we have to let him go.

1689
01:23:52,768 --> 01:23:54,361
He needs to go free.

1690
01:23:56,328 --> 01:23:58,445
He'll be back. He promised.

1691
01:24:00,008 --> 01:24:03,285
Could you please call me a damn cab?
I'm blind!

1692
01:24:03,408 --> 01:24:04,408
Of course!

1693
01:24:05,128 --> 01:24:07,848
<i>Ron, the operation was a success.</i>

1694
01:24:08,608 --> 01:24:11,442
But we won't know for sure
until we remove the bandages.

1695
01:24:18,368 --> 01:24:19,882
Well?

1696
01:24:20,008 --> 01:24:21,806
Yes.

1697
01:24:21,928 --> 01:24:23,362
I can see.

1698
01:24:27,168 --> 01:24:30,525
Oh, God, oh, God.
It's Ron Burgundy, everyone!

1699
01:24:30,728 --> 01:24:32,242
You are my inspiration.

1700
01:24:32,368 --> 01:24:34,007
Well, thank you.

1701
01:24:35,288 --> 01:24:36,288
Welcome back, Ron.

1702
01:24:36,528 --> 01:24:37,962
Thanks. Thanks, Bri-man.

1703
01:24:38,528 --> 01:24:39,723
Good luck in Vietnam.

1704
01:24:40,488 --> 01:24:41,717
Brick.

1705
01:24:41,928 --> 01:24:43,128
Brick and I are having a baby!

1706
01:24:43,208 --> 01:24:44,688
We're gonna name him
Tortilla Jackson.

1707
01:24:44,728 --> 01:24:46,367
- All right.
- I'm 22 months pregnant.

1708
01:24:46,488 --> 01:24:47,478
Well, get over here, you bastard.

1709
01:24:47,608 --> 01:24:48,808
Got you a drink, Ron. Come on.

1710
01:24:49,848 --> 01:24:53,285
Hold on to that drink.
I just want to grab some air.

1711
01:25:04,808 --> 01:25:06,242
How you doing there?

1712
01:25:08,328 --> 01:25:10,638
I'm fine. Just...

1713
01:25:11,768 --> 01:25:13,168
Just a lot of people in there.

1714
01:25:13,528 --> 01:25:17,283
Listen, Ron,
I'm sorry that I never called or visited.

1715
01:25:17,528 --> 01:25:19,201
There's no need to explain.

1716
01:25:19,583 --> 01:25:20,904
But, listen, I mean, you're back.

1717
01:25:20,928 --> 01:25:21,928
Hello, Ron.

1718
01:25:23,328 --> 01:25:24,398
What are you doing here?

1719
01:25:24,728 --> 01:25:27,562
I had to come tell you
something very important.

1720
01:25:29,528 --> 01:25:30,803
You must be Linda Jackson.

1721
01:25:30,968 --> 01:25:32,368
You must be Veronica.

1722
01:25:32,488 --> 01:25:33,808
Yes, I am. It's a pleasure.

1723
01:25:34,048 --> 01:25:35,607
This is a touching moment for me.

1724
01:25:35,728 --> 01:25:39,802
Please, don't take this the wrong way,
but if you touch Ron again,

1725
01:25:39,928 --> 01:25:41,806
I will pop up from
the back seat of your car

1726
01:25:41,928 --> 01:25:43,920
and burn your face with a curling iron.

1727
01:25:44,848 --> 01:25:46,328
You can talk big all you want,

1728
01:25:46,448 --> 01:25:48,883
but guess what,
this kitten's got claws, bitch.

1729
01:25:49,168 --> 01:25:50,568
Don't mess with me, Linda,

1730
01:25:50,688 --> 01:25:53,681
because this "White Thunder" rolls
deep and it rolls nasty.

1731
01:25:53,808 --> 01:25:55,242
I was feeling a little bit down,

1732
01:25:55,368 --> 01:25:57,405
but this is definitely
picking up my mood.

1733
01:25:57,528 --> 01:25:59,565
Well, I guess I'll leave you two alone.

1734
01:25:59,688 --> 01:26:02,487
And it's been
an absolute pleasure, Ms Corningstone.

1735
01:26:02,728 --> 01:26:03,728
This has been great.

1736
01:26:03,808 --> 01:26:05,447
Do you guys want to kiss real quick?

1737
01:26:05,568 --> 01:26:07,321
Ron. Read the room.

1738
01:26:07,688 --> 01:26:08,963
I'll take that as a no.

1739
01:26:09,728 --> 01:26:11,321
Bye, Linda.

1740
01:26:11,888 --> 01:26:13,880
I know why you haven't
been returning my messages.

1741
01:26:14,048 --> 01:26:18,008
I wasn't calling for me, I was calling
because Walter has a piano recital

1742
01:26:18,128 --> 01:26:20,768
in half an hour
at the Tishman School on 65th Street.

1743
01:26:20,888 --> 01:26:23,244
And he wrote a piece for you, Ron.

1744
01:26:24,168 --> 01:26:25,168
Walter.

1745
01:26:25,288 --> 01:26:28,008
It would mean the absolute
world to him to have you there.

1746
01:26:28,128 --> 01:26:31,200
Ron, I just got a call
from the control room! Big fan.

1747
01:26:32,128 --> 01:26:35,280
Actress Sheila Blackledge,
the mom from the hit sitcom

1748
01:26:35,408 --> 01:26:37,320
<i>Four's a Family, Five's a Crowd,</i>

1749
01:26:37,488 --> 01:26:39,798
she just found out
her husband cheated on her

1750
01:26:39,928 --> 01:26:42,648
and she severed his penis
while he slept!

1751
01:26:42,808 --> 01:26:43,808
Oh, my goodness.

1752
01:26:43,928 --> 01:26:47,319
The police arrived.
She fled in her white Bronco,

1753
01:26:47,488 --> 01:26:50,799
and now they're engaged
in a high-speed car chase!

1754
01:26:50,928 --> 01:26:52,965
We've got an exclusive on the live feed,

1755
01:26:53,088 --> 01:26:54,886
but we've got to go, right now!

1756
01:26:55,048 --> 01:26:58,086
Ron, this can be your comeback.

1757
01:26:58,448 --> 01:27:00,565
- Veronica, I...
- No, Ron. No.

1758
01:27:01,528 --> 01:27:03,281
That will get sky-high ratings.

1759
01:27:03,848 --> 01:27:06,682
- Walter will understand.
- Walter will understand.

1760
01:27:07,288 --> 01:27:08,288
Go.

1761
01:27:09,008 --> 01:27:10,488
Come on, Ron. Priorities!

1762
01:27:10,688 --> 01:27:12,407
- Veronica!
- Come on!

1763
01:27:14,488 --> 01:27:16,127
<i>- Can you hear me?</i>
- Yes, yes.

1764
01:27:16,248 --> 01:27:17,398
You're coming in loud and clear.

1765
01:27:17,528 --> 01:27:18,928
You're back and you get this story.

1766
01:27:18,968 --> 01:27:20,766
- This is gonna be huge.
- Right.

1767
01:27:20,888 --> 01:27:22,481
So, is it good to be back home?

1768
01:27:22,608 --> 01:27:23,883
Yeah, I feel good.

1769
01:27:24,008 --> 01:27:26,398
<i>God, look at him.</i>
<i>Like a beacon in the night!</i>

1770
01:27:27,128 --> 01:27:28,323
My golden goose.

1771
01:27:28,448 --> 01:27:29,484
<i>All right, baby.</i>

1772
01:27:29,608 --> 01:27:31,088
So I'm just gonna be
giving you the details.

1773
01:27:31,288 --> 01:27:32,517
Five, four,

1774
01:27:32,648 --> 01:27:33,843
three, two...

1775
01:27:35,368 --> 01:27:36,368
Good evening, America.

1776
01:27:36,448 --> 01:27:40,408
After some time off,
it's good to be back with you.

1777
01:27:40,528 --> 01:27:42,008
I'm Ron Burgundy.

1778
01:27:42,128 --> 01:27:45,280
We have a story tonight
involving an affair,

1779
01:27:45,408 --> 01:27:49,641
a cut-off penis,
a TV star and a car chase.

1780
01:27:49,768 --> 01:27:50,997
And throw it to the feed.

1781
01:27:53,128 --> 01:27:54,482
The only problem is...

1782
01:27:55,968 --> 01:27:57,721
- What's he doing?
- Ron, are you okay?

1783
01:27:58,448 --> 01:27:59,802
- It's not news.
- What?

1784
01:27:59,928 --> 01:28:00,998
Turn off the prompter.

1785
01:28:01,128 --> 01:28:02,128
<i>Ron, this is Kench.</i>

1786
01:28:02,208 --> 01:28:03,403
<i>What the hell do you</i>
<i>think you're doing, mate?</i>

1787
01:28:03,528 --> 01:28:07,044
Just read what's in front of you,
or I will ruin you! Don't!

1788
01:28:07,288 --> 01:28:09,200
Don't!
You leave Kench inside your head!

1789
01:28:10,168 --> 01:28:12,524
- God damn it!
- He took out his earpiece.

1790
01:28:12,728 --> 01:28:15,323
You see, folks,
I've read a lot of news in my day,

1791
01:28:16,728 --> 01:28:19,800
but it's... It's taken me until now

1792
01:28:20,888 --> 01:28:23,084
to realise what real news is.

1793
01:28:23,528 --> 01:28:25,724
Real news is supposed
to let people know

1794
01:28:26,008 --> 01:28:30,082
what the powerful are up to, so that
that power doesn't become corrupt.

1795
01:28:30,448 --> 01:28:32,519
But what happens when
the powerful own the news?

1796
01:28:32,648 --> 01:28:34,765
You piece of shit!

1797
01:28:34,888 --> 01:28:36,641
Shit. He's blowing the whole thing up.

1798
01:28:36,928 --> 01:28:39,682
Recently, I've been
on a bit of a personal journey.

1799
01:28:40,048 --> 01:28:43,678
I made love to a proud,
intelligent black woman.

1800
01:28:45,208 --> 01:28:46,642
I became blind.

1801
01:28:47,288 --> 01:28:49,757
And I smoked a fair amount of crack.

1802
01:28:50,208 --> 01:28:54,441
But the most important thing I've learned
is that there was an emptiness left

1803
01:28:55,048 --> 01:28:58,598
after turning my back on three of the
best friends anyone could ever ask for.

1804
01:28:59,088 --> 01:29:00,204
Hi, Ron!

1805
01:29:00,328 --> 01:29:01,921
So, if you'll excuse me,

1806
01:29:02,048 --> 01:29:04,119
I'm going to see my child's recital

1807
01:29:04,248 --> 01:29:07,878
and tell the woman I love
that I still love her.

1808
01:29:09,168 --> 01:29:11,763
Good night, America, and never forget,

1809
01:29:13,048 --> 01:29:14,164
you deserve the truth.

1810
01:29:18,248 --> 01:29:19,762
Good. He's dead, done.

1811
01:29:19,888 --> 01:29:22,005
Linda, get the skirt in,
the blonde. Anyone!

1812
01:29:22,128 --> 01:29:23,608
He's coming back!

1813
01:29:23,728 --> 01:29:25,321
Also, one other thing.

1814
01:29:25,448 --> 01:29:28,247
Koala Airlines is a really shitty airline.

1815
01:29:28,528 --> 01:29:31,407
You son of a bitch! You son of a bitch!

1816
01:29:35,688 --> 01:29:36,688
Guys, I'm sorry.

1817
01:29:37,048 --> 01:29:39,961
For a while there, I don't know
what became of Ron Burgundy.

1818
01:29:40,328 --> 01:29:42,763
Brick, I'm sorry I yelled at you.

1819
01:29:43,648 --> 01:29:44,648
Brian, I...

1820
01:29:44,808 --> 01:29:47,004
No reason why I killed
that story of yours.

1821
01:29:47,128 --> 01:29:48,357
It was excellent reporting.

1822
01:29:48,808 --> 01:29:51,926
And, Champ, I'm sorry
I said no to all those

1823
01:29:52,048 --> 01:29:55,678
offers for late-night
deep-tissue rubdowns.

1824
01:29:57,168 --> 01:29:58,727
Ron, you're a good man.

1825
01:29:58,848 --> 01:30:02,000
But you have fallen victim
to your own ego and your own hubris.

1826
01:30:02,528 --> 01:30:05,839
And before others can forgive you,
you must learn to forgive yourself.

1827
01:30:09,128 --> 01:30:10,128
What was that, Brick?

1828
01:30:10,608 --> 01:30:12,201
I'm wearing two pairs of pants.

1829
01:30:14,448 --> 01:30:15,598
Thank you.

1830
01:30:15,728 --> 01:30:17,447
Ron, we're a team.

1831
01:30:18,808 --> 01:30:19,808
We need you.

1832
01:30:19,888 --> 01:30:21,368
Let him go, Champ.

1833
01:30:26,448 --> 01:30:27,598
Ron!

1834
01:30:28,328 --> 01:30:31,002
Long live Ron Burgundy!

1835
01:30:39,208 --> 01:30:41,848
I'm Brick Tamland for <i>GNN News.</i>

1836
01:30:42,568 --> 01:30:46,084
<i>The itsy bitsy spider</i>
<i>went up the water spout.</i>

1837
01:30:46,408 --> 01:30:49,958
<i>Down came the rain</i>
<i>and washed the spider out.</i>

1838
01:30:50,088 --> 01:30:51,681
You little hack!

1839
01:30:52,128 --> 01:30:53,562
Who the hell do you think you are?

1840
01:30:53,688 --> 01:30:54,838
After everything I've done for you,

1841
01:30:54,968 --> 01:30:57,244
this is how you repay me?
Well, I will crush you!

1842
01:31:00,008 --> 01:31:01,408
Once again, Mr Burgundy,

1843
01:31:01,528 --> 01:31:04,043
you are the ballsiest
white man I've ever known.

1844
01:31:04,168 --> 01:31:05,682
What the hell?

1845
01:31:06,448 --> 01:31:08,167
One more for old times' sake.

1846
01:31:14,528 --> 01:31:15,528
Thank you.

1847
01:31:15,608 --> 01:31:17,520
Is Dad going to come?

1848
01:31:17,648 --> 01:31:19,367
No, sweetheart, Daddy has to work.

1849
01:31:19,488 --> 01:31:21,559
He's going to come. I know it.

1850
01:31:22,008 --> 01:31:23,008
Taxi!

1851
01:31:23,688 --> 01:31:25,600
Taxi! Taxi!

1852
01:31:25,728 --> 01:31:26,728
Damn it!

1853
01:31:27,008 --> 01:31:30,080
It's so hard for a proud Mexican
to get a taxi in this city!

1854
01:31:30,928 --> 01:31:32,157
I need to see my son!

1855
01:31:32,608 --> 01:31:36,682
And now, to play an original
composition that he wrote for his father,

1856
01:31:36,808 --> 01:31:39,482
here is seven-year-old Walter Burgundy.

1857
01:31:47,888 --> 01:31:50,198
I made a promise!
I made a promise to my son!

1858
01:31:53,768 --> 01:31:54,768
What the hell?

1859
01:31:55,248 --> 01:31:56,762
Well, hello, Ron.

1860
01:31:57,328 --> 01:31:58,364
You out for a jog?

1861
01:31:58,608 --> 01:31:59,883
Jack Lime!

1862
01:32:01,048 --> 01:32:02,243
Where's everyone going?

1863
01:32:02,368 --> 01:32:05,202
Please. I don't have time to talk, okay?
I have to be somewhere.

1864
01:32:05,608 --> 01:32:07,409
Well, that's funny.
'Cause I got nowhere to be

1865
01:32:08,048 --> 01:32:10,085
because you pretty much
destroyed my career.

1866
01:32:10,728 --> 01:32:14,199
Do you realise what it did to me,
by making me call myself Jack Lame?

1867
01:32:15,288 --> 01:32:17,041
It was a living hell!

1868
01:32:19,328 --> 01:32:22,321
Look, I'm sorry,
but I'm out of the news game.

1869
01:32:22,448 --> 01:32:23,598
I just walked away.

1870
01:32:23,728 --> 01:32:25,924
You can't just walk away from the news.

1871
01:32:26,048 --> 01:32:28,722
I'm telling you, you have to let me go!

1872
01:32:29,048 --> 01:32:30,801
Don't worry. Four against one.

1873
01:32:31,528 --> 01:32:32,848
This will be over fast.

1874
01:32:33,648 --> 01:32:35,207
Maybe not so fast!

1875
01:32:38,608 --> 01:32:40,679
My news team. Thank God!

1876
01:32:42,528 --> 01:32:46,807
Ain't a day that will be or has been
that we don't have Ron Burgundy's back.

1877
01:32:47,048 --> 01:32:48,880
Not a problem.
When I'm done with these mutts,

1878
01:32:49,008 --> 01:32:50,448
I'm gonna wipe my shoes on the kerb.

1879
01:32:50,528 --> 01:32:52,121
Oh, yeah, Jack Lime?

1880
01:32:52,528 --> 01:32:53,928
When I'm done with you,

1881
01:32:54,048 --> 01:32:56,608
my mom's going to
pick me up and take me home.

1882
01:32:56,728 --> 01:32:57,844
Wait!

1883
01:33:01,168 --> 01:33:04,161
It's too bad you don't have
free health care

1884
01:33:04,288 --> 01:33:09,204
because the BBC World Service
is about to beat your asses bloody.

1885
01:33:10,528 --> 01:33:12,520
God save the Queen

1886
01:33:12,648 --> 01:33:15,880
and God kill Ron Burgundy.

1887
01:33:17,448 --> 01:33:19,007
No. Not now.

1888
01:33:19,128 --> 01:33:20,244
Fall back, fall back.

1889
01:33:24,208 --> 01:33:25,329
If y'all are gonna get down,

1890
01:33:25,368 --> 01:33:28,088
then Wesley Jackson and
the MTV News crew want in.

1891
01:33:28,248 --> 01:33:29,682
What's MTV?

1892
01:33:30,408 --> 01:33:31,688
I think it's a venereal disease.

1893
01:33:31,968 --> 01:33:33,687
The most requested video of the day?

1894
01:33:33,808 --> 01:33:36,767
A new band called
Burgundy's Sucking Chest Wound.

1895
01:33:42,808 --> 01:33:44,561
It wouldn't be a battle
without Jill Janson.

1896
01:33:44,688 --> 01:33:46,919
And Wendy Van Peele
from <i>Entertainment News.</i>

1897
01:33:47,048 --> 01:33:49,119
Entertainment news is an abomination!

1898
01:33:49,448 --> 01:33:51,883
Who are you wearing today?
Look, it's your own blood!

1899
01:33:52,208 --> 01:33:53,801
Today's celebrity birthdays... None.

1900
01:33:53,968 --> 01:33:55,197
Today's celebrity deaths...

1901
01:33:55,328 --> 01:33:56,887
All you dick licks!

1902
01:33:58,888 --> 01:34:00,083
Hey!

1903
01:34:00,928 --> 01:34:03,841
There's not gonna
be any fight without Scott Riles

1904
01:34:04,088 --> 01:34:06,444
and the incredibly polite
Canadian News team.

1905
01:34:08,088 --> 01:34:10,557
What about
the French-speaking Quebec News?

1906
01:34:10,728 --> 01:34:12,128
The real voice of Canada!

1907
01:34:12,248 --> 01:34:13,248
Give it a rest, eh?

1908
01:34:13,328 --> 01:34:15,718
Give me a break! They can't have news.

1909
01:34:15,928 --> 01:34:17,157
Nothing happens in Canada!

1910
01:34:17,328 --> 01:34:18,762
We're gonna mop the floor with you!

1911
01:34:18,888 --> 01:34:20,004
We're gonna put the boots to you!

1912
01:34:20,128 --> 01:34:21,128
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

1913
01:34:21,208 --> 01:34:24,406
We're gonna gouge your eyes out!
And kick your head in!

1914
01:34:24,528 --> 01:34:25,803
- Sorry!
- Sorry!

1915
01:34:25,928 --> 01:34:27,362
I like your ginger ale!

1916
01:34:31,168 --> 01:34:33,524
Jeff Bullington, ESPN, all sports.

1917
01:34:33,648 --> 01:34:35,799
Tonight's play of the day is me,

1918
01:34:35,928 --> 01:34:37,760
extracting your spine
from your dead body.

1919
01:34:38,008 --> 01:34:39,806
Holy shit, there's a lot of news!

1920
01:34:39,968 --> 01:34:42,119
It's true, the market
is becoming saturated.

1921
01:34:42,328 --> 01:34:45,799
Hey. The History Network
wants in on this. We're news, too.

1922
01:34:45,928 --> 01:34:48,363
Only news told much, much later.

1923
01:34:49,928 --> 01:34:53,080
Wait a minute. Is that the ghost
of Stonewall Jackson with you?

1924
01:34:53,288 --> 01:34:55,962
Yes, it is. And the mighty Minotaur.

1925
01:34:57,088 --> 01:34:58,283
I don't know about this, man.

1926
01:34:58,448 --> 01:35:01,247
The Minotaur isn't even history!
He's mythology!

1927
01:35:02,888 --> 01:35:04,720
All right, everyone, listen up!

1928
01:35:08,408 --> 01:35:12,925
By virtue of being on this battlefield,
there is no return.

1929
01:35:14,448 --> 01:35:15,848
People will die.

1930
01:35:16,208 --> 01:35:17,358
I'm so horny right now.

1931
01:35:17,528 --> 01:35:19,121
Some will be disfigured.

1932
01:35:19,328 --> 01:35:23,288
In some cases,
lasting friendships will be made.

1933
01:35:24,288 --> 01:35:28,362
And as usual,
no touching of the hair and face.

1934
01:35:28,728 --> 01:35:30,799
Come on.
What do we look like, rookies?

1935
01:35:30,928 --> 01:35:31,928
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

1936
01:35:32,088 --> 01:35:33,727
When El Trousias,

1937
01:35:33,968 --> 01:35:36,961
maiden of the clouds,
blows the battle horn,

1938
01:35:37,568 --> 01:35:39,480
let the battle begin!

1939
01:35:39,728 --> 01:35:41,924
I am El Trousias!

1940
01:35:43,848 --> 01:35:45,885
Hear my siren song!

1941
01:35:48,168 --> 01:35:50,888
El Trousias... The Juicies'.

1942
01:35:56,848 --> 01:35:58,202
That means you can start.

1943
01:35:59,648 --> 01:36:01,480
Brick, what the hell is that?

1944
01:36:02,168 --> 01:36:03,397
It's a gun from the future.

1945
01:36:03,848 --> 01:36:05,487
No fair! He's got a gun from the future!

1946
01:36:05,928 --> 01:36:07,601
Where did you get it from?

1947
01:36:22,288 --> 01:36:25,884
In the name of the King,
the Queen and St George.

1948
01:36:28,808 --> 01:36:29,808
Huzzah!

1949
01:37:01,168 --> 01:37:02,522
Guess you didn't see that coming.

1950
01:37:03,928 --> 01:37:05,408
Twenty degrees right.

1951
01:37:22,408 --> 01:37:23,408
Sorry!

1952
01:37:24,168 --> 01:37:25,807
- Sorry! Sorry!
- Sorry!

1953
01:37:26,528 --> 01:37:28,406
Sex Panther powers activate.

1954
01:37:51,688 --> 01:37:53,759
In the name of Margaret Thatcher...

1955
01:37:53,888 --> 01:37:55,720
- No!
- I sentence you to death!

1956
01:37:55,848 --> 01:37:57,328
Please, no!

1957
01:38:00,968 --> 01:38:02,641
What in the name of Dan Issel?

1958
01:38:04,928 --> 01:38:05,928
Gary!

1959
01:38:06,088 --> 01:38:07,283
Yes, Ron.

1960
01:38:08,648 --> 01:38:10,480
You and I never got along.

1961
01:38:10,648 --> 01:38:12,207
But using the power of my mind,

1962
01:38:12,328 --> 01:38:14,888
I was able to see in the future
that you would do good.

1963
01:38:16,728 --> 01:38:18,048
- Now, go.
- I knew it!

1964
01:38:18,168 --> 01:38:19,568
Go to your son's recital.

1965
01:38:19,728 --> 01:38:21,242
I knew you had mind powers!

1966
01:38:21,368 --> 01:38:23,360
And make it the greatest day of your life!

1967
01:38:23,568 --> 01:38:25,605
Almighty, Almighty,
light the fuse on my call.

1968
01:38:25,728 --> 01:38:27,560
Thirty-niner-niner-14, cook these fools.

1969
01:38:27,688 --> 01:38:29,042
I repeat, cook these fools.

1970
01:38:39,888 --> 01:38:42,005
We've got to get out of here.
There's too much news!

1971
01:38:42,128 --> 01:38:43,642
Man, what a rush!

1972
01:38:43,768 --> 01:38:45,088
The monster's my friend!

1973
01:38:45,208 --> 01:38:47,165
Ron, we can still make your kid's recital!

1974
01:38:48,528 --> 01:38:50,167
Hey, Ronny.

1975
01:38:50,448 --> 01:38:53,361
Jack Lime, please,
I just want to get to my son's recital.

1976
01:38:53,488 --> 01:38:55,207
No! That is out of the question!

1977
01:38:55,328 --> 01:38:56,328
We're outnumbered, Ron.

1978
01:38:56,408 --> 01:38:57,967
Foam the runway, I'm coming in hot!

1979
01:39:09,728 --> 01:39:12,800
<i>Old MacDonald had a farm</i>

1980
01:39:13,048 --> 01:39:15,085
And then four guys on bikes showed up.

1981
01:39:15,568 --> 01:39:18,242
Wes Mantooth and the
Channel Nine news team!

1982
01:39:18,568 --> 01:39:19,843
Hey, what the hell
are you guys doing here?

1983
01:39:19,968 --> 01:39:21,243
This is a national news fight.

1984
01:39:21,568 --> 01:39:23,082
You made one mistake today.

1985
01:39:23,928 --> 01:39:25,760
You messed with somebody
from San Diego.

1986
01:39:26,288 --> 01:39:29,201
It's actually pronounced San Diago.

1987
01:39:29,488 --> 01:39:31,844
Hell, Ron and I
may not agree on everything,

1988
01:39:32,728 --> 01:39:33,928
but we share the bond of being

1989
01:39:34,048 --> 01:39:36,088
from the greatest city
in the history of this Earth.

1990
01:39:37,488 --> 01:39:38,683
Well, ain't that cute?

1991
01:39:39,408 --> 01:39:40,888
But you're outnumbered three-to-one.

1992
01:39:41,888 --> 01:39:44,448
Now here's the thing.
While I've been talking,

1993
01:39:44,568 --> 01:39:47,879
my news team has emptied
their gas tanks at your feet.

1994
01:39:50,808 --> 01:39:53,323
I drop this smoke and
every one of you goes "poof."

1995
01:39:53,648 --> 01:39:55,605
Well, you forgot one thing, leatherman.

1996
01:39:55,728 --> 01:39:57,287
You drop that smoke, you die, too.

1997
01:40:01,048 --> 01:40:02,767
With the things I've done in my life,

1998
01:40:03,688 --> 01:40:05,520
I know I'm going to burn in hell.

1999
01:40:06,608 --> 01:40:09,123
So I sure as shit
ain't afraid to burn here on Earth.

2000
01:40:09,528 --> 01:40:11,008
Oh, my goodness!

2001
01:40:11,208 --> 01:40:13,245
That's the most
badass thing I have ever heard.

2002
01:40:13,968 --> 01:40:15,084
All right!

2003
01:40:16,448 --> 01:40:17,608
Looks like this fight's over.

2004
01:40:19,488 --> 01:40:20,604
Let's go, boys.

2005
01:40:21,768 --> 01:40:24,488
Yay! We won! Let's celebrate!

2006
01:40:24,648 --> 01:40:25,798
Sparklers!

2007
01:40:25,928 --> 01:40:28,488
- No, no, no, Brick!
- No!

2008
01:40:51,488 --> 01:40:53,684
- Bravo! Bravo.
- Yeah.

2009
01:40:55,888 --> 01:40:56,888
Dad!

2010
01:40:57,088 --> 01:40:59,284
Son, I fought a Minotaur to be here.

2011
01:40:59,928 --> 01:41:01,078
And I'd do it again.

2012
01:41:01,328 --> 01:41:04,719
Dad! Together we can defeat voodoo!

2013
01:41:05,128 --> 01:41:07,688
<i>Ron had finally</i>
<i>learned how to love his son</i>

2014
01:41:07,808 --> 01:41:10,323
<i>and his wife more than his career.</i>

2015
01:41:11,408 --> 01:41:13,877
<i>And as it turned out,</i>
<i>his walking off the news</i>

2016
01:41:14,408 --> 01:41:17,480
<i>was the highest-rated</i>
<i>TV event of the year.</i>

2017
01:41:18,208 --> 01:41:20,598
<i>He and his news team,</i>
<i>along with Veronica,</i>

2018
01:41:20,728 --> 01:41:23,118
<i>could have any job they wanted.</i>

2019
01:41:23,888 --> 01:41:27,438
<i>But before that, they had one</i>
<i>little thing to take care of.</i>

2020
01:41:29,808 --> 01:41:33,643
And now, before I join this
couple in holy matrimony,

2021
01:41:34,128 --> 01:41:38,327
Brick and Chani ask us to join them
as they exchange their vows.

2022
01:41:39,328 --> 01:41:40,328
My dearest Brick.

2023
01:41:40,768 --> 01:41:42,361
Everything I have is yours.

2024
01:41:43,368 --> 01:41:45,599
My four lawnmowers. My sister.

2025
01:41:46,648 --> 01:41:48,241
My 35 ferrets.

2026
01:41:48,368 --> 01:41:50,485
My massive student loan
and real estate debt.

2027
01:41:51,048 --> 01:41:52,164
It's all yours.

2028
01:41:54,088 --> 01:41:55,363
Oh, Chani.

2029
01:41:55,488 --> 01:41:58,526
I will never forget
the exact moment I saw you.

2030
01:41:58,648 --> 01:42:01,163
My pee-pee got all uncomfortable
in my pants

2031
01:42:01,288 --> 01:42:04,406
and I thought, "Uh-oh, SpaghettiO,

2032
01:42:04,528 --> 01:42:08,602
"here comes the warm milkshake
out of the tip of my bellystick."

2033
01:42:09,208 --> 01:42:11,723
I now pronounce you man and wife.

2034
01:42:11,848 --> 01:42:13,202
You may kiss the bride.

2035
01:42:26,688 --> 01:42:29,248
Wonderful. Beautiful ceremony.

2036
01:47:46,928 --> 01:47:48,806
All right, let's do it.

2037
01:47:50,128 --> 01:47:51,562
You guys think...

2038
01:47:51,688 --> 01:47:53,122
I don't know how to use a computer.

2039
01:47:53,248 --> 01:47:56,207
Hey, fellas.
I just saw Jack Lime out there.

2040
01:47:56,328 --> 01:47:58,479
He's a goddamn iceman.

2041
01:47:58,608 --> 01:48:00,759
Scared the crap out of me.

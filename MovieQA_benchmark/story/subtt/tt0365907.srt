1
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:02,120
<i>You need some help, man.</i>

2
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:04,004
<i>Oh, God.</i>

3
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:06,050
I don't care.

4
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:07,525
You want to mess up your own shit.

5
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,529
But you're going to mess up mine, too.

6
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,410
I need to know you got my back.

7
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,881
Not that you're going to come falling
through the door behind me...

8
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,201
Don't worry your pretty little spic head off.

9
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:25,484
Anyway. That was all I wanted to say.

10
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:26,561
Is that it?

11
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:31,681
Fuck you.

12
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:43,441
Scudder.

13
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,531
Remember us?

14
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:38,080
Okay, get out. Both of you.

15
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,440
I told you last night that we...

16
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,530
Oh, my God!

17
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:03,830
Is everybody okay?

18
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,206
Get down!

19
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,681
Get behind me! Get down!

20
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:08,761
Move it!

21
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,000
- Stay low!
- Duck inside!

22
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,127
Hey, Matt.

23
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,366
It's me, Peter.

24
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,685
You know, Peter Kristo...

25
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,364
Oh, Peter. Hi.

26
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,405
Do I know you, Peter?

27
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,686
Yeah, I led a meeting a few weeks ago.

28
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,724
You know, I'm a painter,

29
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,051
got hooked on smack in art school...

30
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,120
Oh, yeah.

31
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,083
You're the guy did the
Jackson Pollock number

32
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,084
on the wall of the john
with the blood from your...

33
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,605
- Syringe.
- Yeah.

34
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,762
- Yeah, that was me.
- I enjoyed your story.

35
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:51,320
Oh! Thanks. Appreciate it.

36
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,090
Do you mind?

37
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,605
Sure, sit down.

38
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,600
Can't smoke in here, honey.

39
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,409
- Yeah.
- Something wrong, Peter?

40
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:08,083
It's my brother, you know?
He needs your help.

41
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,331
What kind of help?

42
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,447
I think it would be better
if you came out to Clinton Hill,

43
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,090
talked about it there with him.

44
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,525
Clinton Hill.

45
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:21,321
Yeah, he'll pay for your cab
out there and back, and your time.

46
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,528
Whether you take it or not.

47
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:28,406
Please, just hear what he got to say,
that's all I'm asking.

48
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,608
When does your brother
want to have this chat?

49
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,044
Well, you know. Right now.

50
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,804
That's what I was afraid
you were gonna say.

51
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,560
- Here you go, Matt.
- Thanks, Jenny.

52
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:39,880
Yeah, I'm sorry.

53
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,806
You're eating.

54
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,650
I'll come back.

55
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,684
Yeah, if you're...

56
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:06,767
Jenny, would you keep this warm for me, please?
I'll be back.

57
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,609
Half an hour, right there on the right.

58
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,561
That's it. Yeah, it's a nice place, right?

59
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,890
All right, Mr. Matt. Go on up.

60
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,800
Kenny don't like me smoking
in the house, so...

61
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,605
Hey, Kenny.

62
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:38,127
Mr. Scudder. Come in.

63
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,441
Can I get you something to drink?

64
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:49,330
Not a "drink" drink,
I know you know Peter from AA,

65
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,769
but there's coffee made,
or I can offer you a soda.

66
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:52,887
I'm fine.

67
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:55,606
So you're a private detective,
is that right?

68
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,722
- Unlicensed.
- What's that mean?

69
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,326
It means that sometimes
I do favors for people,

70
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,125
and sometimes, in return,
they give me gifts.

71
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:08,724
Gifts. Uh, but you used to be a cop, right?

72
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,122
Yeah, I was with the 6th Precinct

73
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,326
in the Village for a while.

74
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:15,611
And before that,
I was over here with the 75th.

75
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,569
So why'd you quit?

76
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:20,201
I didn't like the hours, Mr. Kristo.

77
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:22,442
Nah, the corruption got to you, huh?

78
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,245
Not really.

79
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:27,324
It would have been hard
to support my family without it.

80
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,684
So, what can I do for you?

81
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,924
Well, this was really my brother's idea,

82
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,162
you know, bringing you out here.

83
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,410
You want, I can leave.

84
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,606
Someone's kidnapped my wife.

85
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:46,686
That's a federal matter.

86
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,285
They said not to call the cops.

87
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,528
Naturally they would.
When did this happen?

88
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,090
Yesterday.

89
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,685
You should be talking to the FBI.

90
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,524
- I'm talking to you.
- Look, Mr. Kristo...

91
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,329
- Kenny.
- Kenny.

92
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,209
If you're asking me to run a bag,
deliver money,

93
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,566
that is not something I do.

94
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:04,846
I already paid them.

95
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,201
When?

96
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:08,961
Last night.

97
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,566
How much?

98
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:11,687
$400,000.

99
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,531
And your wife? Where is she?

100
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,645
She's dead.

101
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,928
I paid them, but they killed her anyway.

102
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,724
I see.

103
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,849
- I'm sorry.
- I don't want you to be sorry.

104
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:38,129
I want you to find the men who did this
and bring them to me.

105
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,802
You say you paid them
the 400 the same day?

106
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:41,881
That's right.

107
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:48,367
You mind if I ask
what kind of business you're in, Kenny?

108
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,086
Construction.

109
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,085
What exactly do you construct?

110
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,161
Houses.

111
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:59,961
Then I guess Peter's standing outside
right now because he what?

112
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,762
Doesn't like your building methods?

113
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,605
Peter's not supposed to associate
with people like me.

114
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,762
People in my profession.

115
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,441
Since when is drug dealing a profession?

116
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:14,248
I mean, that's the reason, isn't it?

117
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,921
I'm sitting here and not the cops?
You're a dealer.

118
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:20,011
Properly speaking,
I'm more of a trafficker than a dealer.

119
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,809
You understand the distinction.

120
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:25,127
I really don't give a shit
one way or the other.

121
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,289
But whoever it was took your wife

122
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:30,886
didn't just pick your name
out of a hat.

123
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,331
They must have had some idea
you had that kind of cash on hand.

124
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,448
That's exactly what I
want you to find out.

125
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,170
Who did this?

126
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,290
Now there's $20,000.

127
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:42,089
Consider it my gift to you.

128
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,686
There's 20 more, you find
the two fucks who killed her.

129
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,844
So that you can kill them.

130
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:00,923
I'm sorry, but I can't help you.

131
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:14,611
Would've been nice,
you told me what your brother was.

132
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:15,920
Yeah, you wouldn't a come.

133
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,445
That's right. I wouldn't have.

134
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,164
I stopped drinking that day.

135
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,242
Just wasn't as much fun after that.

136
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:37,367
Well, I guess I'm just a...

137
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:42,364
Anyway, I'm eight years sober.

138
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,768
And I... Well...

139
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:50,203
That's all. Thanks.

140
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,041
Howie.

141
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:11,721
Hurt yourself?

142
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,962
Found it out back by the dumpster.

143
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:16,247
Mrs. Dolgren in 202

144
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,721
left it there when Mr. D
stroked out last week.

145
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,561
Any messages?

146
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,244
I never told you her name.

147
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:39,571
I don't want you to think
that I'm cruel

148
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,245
or don't care.

149
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,685
I just can't say it.

150
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:54,841
What happened?

151
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:04,961
<i>Hey</i>

152
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,081
Hello?

153
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:10,686
<i>Carrie Anne, what's your game now?</i>

154
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:11,841
Hello?

155
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,604
<i>She never came home, right?</i>

156
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,041
Excuse me?

157
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:17,964
We've got your wife, fucko.

158
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,366
Carrie?

159
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:32,966
Carrie?

160
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:36,725
Baby, you up there?

161
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,201
What is it you want?

162
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:53,769
We want to help you get your wife back.
If you want her back, that is.

163
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,171
<i>Of course I want her back.</i>

164
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:57,049
Good. Then stay by the phone,

165
00:14:57,160 --> 00:15:02,121
don't call the police,
and we'll be in touch. Very soon.

166
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:05,006
It was maybe 10 minutes
before they called again.

167
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:07,082
<i>How much does your wife weigh,
Mr. Kristo?</i>

168
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:10,328
<i>110, 120?
Somewhere in that neighborhood?</i>

169
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:13,165
<i>Something like 50 kilograms,
you might say?</i>

170
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:18,769
<i>Now 50 keys, at 20 a key,
run the numbers for me.</i>

171
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,171
<i>Comes out to a million, doesn't it?</i>

172
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,167
What's your point?

173
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:25,646
My point?

174
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:31,004
My point is that you'd pay a million for her
if she were product.

175
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,126
If she was powder, Mr. Kristo.

176
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,248
Isn't she worth as much to you
in flesh and blood?

177
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:38,204
I can't pay what I don't have.

178
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,004
<i>How much do you have?</i>

179
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,361
Four hundred.

180
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:45,521
Five.

181
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:*****9
I'm not haggling.
I gave you the top figure right away.

182
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:48,561
It's 400.

183
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,041
Oh, well.

184
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:54,806
That's the best you can do.
Okay. Four hundred it is.

185
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:58,050
Before I give you anything,
I want to make sure my wife is all right.

186
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:00,806
<i>Well, that's impossible.
I'm at a pay phone.</i>

187
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:03,000
How do I even know you've
got her in the first place?

188
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,644
Are you familiar with her tits?

189
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:05,767
Excuse me?

190
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:08,326
<i>They're quite nice.
Would you recognize one of them?</i>

191
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:11,245
That would be the easiest way.
I could cut one off.

192
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:13,645
The one with the cute little mole on it.

193
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,080
And I'll leave it on your doorstep.

194
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,520
<i>Would that put your mind at rest?</i>

195
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,686
Jesus, don't say that.

196
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:21,401
<i>All right, then let's not talk
any more about proof, okay?</i>

197
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,727
<i>Put the money in two hefty bags.</i>

198
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,727
<i>Go to the corner of
Columbia and Commerce</i>

199
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:30,770
<i>to the pay phone and wait for my call.</i>

200
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:41,681
Hello.

201
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:43,087
<i>Where's the money?</i>

202
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:45,162
In the back seat.
Two bags, like you said.

203
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:49,923
<i>Good. Now leave it.
Walk up Columbia to Richards Street.</i>

204
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:51,761
And then what?

205
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,208
<i>Wait on the corner for five minutes,</i>

206
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:57,170
<i>then walk back,
get in your car and go home.</i>

207
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,925
Well, what about my wife?

208
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:02,922
<i>She'll be in the car
waiting for you.</i>

209
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:11,800
Carrie?

210
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,241
Fuck.

211
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,689
And they run me around, then finally

212
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:31,206
<i>they tell me she's at home,
waiting for me.

213
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,568
<i>I go home and she's not there either.</i>

214
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:34,886
Carrie!

215
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,891
<i>The phone rings again.</i>

216
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,121
Fuck!

217
00:17:*****0 --> 00:17:48,481
Where is she?

218
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,848
<i>They send me over to Red Hook.</i>

219
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:55,328
<i>Tell me she's in the trunk
of this abandoned car.</i>

220
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:39,046
They taped this to the inside of the trunk

221
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:43,682
with a note that said
"for your listening pleasure."

222
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,410
That's my number.

223
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:10,961
<i>It's okay.</i>

224
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:14,326
<i>Look at these. Look at these.</i>

225
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:18,040
<i>I touch them and the nipples get hard.

226
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,401
<i>You get hot even when you're scared,
don't you?</i>

227
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,285
<i>And kiss me.</i>

228
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:31,366
<i>Yeah. Come on,
let's take the tape off of her.</i>

229
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,885
<i>Hey, Carrie Anne</i>

230
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:37,720
<i>Can anybody...</i>

231
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:45,841
<i>Yes?</i>

232
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,605
Where in Red Hook?

233
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:19,885
She tipped me $2, which is twice

234
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:22,327
<i>what anybody else tips,
if they even tip at all.</i>

235
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:23,881
You mentioned a van.

236
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,280
Yeah. It was parked right there.

237
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,685
Two guys got out of it.

238
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:30,240
<i>I remember they checked her out
pretty good.</i>

239
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,440
<i>They were both dressed the same,
some kind of uniform.</i>

240
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,804
They pulled out after Mrs. Kristo,

241
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,646
<i>cut off a Caddy.</i>

242
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,249
- You remember what the van looked like?
- Yeah.

243
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:45,571
It was light blue.
It was definitely light blue.

244
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:48,526
<i>I could tell she was a good cook.</i>

245
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,369
<i>Nothing frozen in her cart.</i>

246
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:52,090
She said she was making Kunafa,

247
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:54,160
so I sent her to the Lebanese place
down the block.

248
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,043
Yeah, the van was parked across the street.

249
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:57,884
I thought they were making a delivery.

250
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,246
I don't remember a van.

251
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:02,045
I do remember the pita maker,
Mrs. Youness, came in

252
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:05,203
and was all like,
"Oh, what happened? Are we okay?"

253
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,929
She saw two men and a woman

254
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:14,726
<i>run across the street away from the store
and leap into a van.</i>

255
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,962
<i>She thought they had
just robbed the store.</i>

256
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:18,041
<i>Two men?</i>

257
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:20,927
Yeah.

258
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,571
I think it had the name of a
TV repair place on the side.

259
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:26,246
TWO initials, like B & R TV.

260
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,281
For sure. J & M Heating.

261
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:30,647
R & L Stereo.

262
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,563
B & A Appliance.

263
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:46,250
TJ, I'd like a word with you.

264
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,571
Now, please.

265
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,450
I know you've been sleeping here.

266
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:56,961
Shit.

267
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:00,806
I know because Mr. Keyser

268
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,645
says you left a god-awful mess
in the men's room.

269
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:08,484
Not to mention the mess you've left here.

270
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,241
TJ, you've got to...

271
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:14,210
He'll clean it up later, okay?

272
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,207
Right now he's helping me with something.

273
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:28,524
You get back issues of all
the New York papers on there?

274
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,401
For what?

275
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,441
Naw, I'm good.

276
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,406
Can see from right here.

277
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:38,089
Not the first old white dude,
come in here,

278
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,400
try to put a hand on me.

279
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:41,041
Okay.

280
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,521
Child of God.

281
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:57,921
What?

282
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:01,364
The name. Gotteskind.
It means "child of God."

283
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:02,561
It's German.

284
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:07,564
Except, clearly,

285
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:09,449
God never looked out for Marie.

286
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:25,562
TJ? That short for something?

287
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:28,009
Yeah, it's short for "TJ."

288
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:32,720
You 5-0?

289
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:33,761
Nope.

290
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,080
'Cause you've got that look.

291
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:36,361
I work private.

292
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:40,445
Yeah? Like Sam Spade?

293
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:41,891
Yeah, just like him.

294
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:46,282
What I'm saying is, I read about him.
And Marlowe, too.

295
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:47,726
All of those guys.

296
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:49,246
You spend that much time in here?

297
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:52,523
Some. Mostly when it rains.

298
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,120
Just like the sound it makes, you know?

299
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:56,401
Matt.

300
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,601
Short for Matthew.

301
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:03,564
So why you looking at dead bitches, Matthew?

302
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:38,522
<i>So these guys we're looking for,
they be like</i>

303
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,881
real 730, or just, like, thugs?

304
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,201
Like real what?

305
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:46,207
730. It's the time they give out the meds
in a mental ward.

306
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:48,489
Right. 730.

307
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:52,044
Can that program go back another year?

308
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:54,487
Listen to you. "That program."

309
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,644
Take you maybe a minute to figure out

310
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:59,166
how to work Yahoo all by yourself.

311
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:00,811
Why bother?

312
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:03,724
From what I hear,
it's all going to shit in six months.

313
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:04,801
Please, please, man.

314
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,564
I got way more important things to do

315
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:09,325
than worry about all that Y2K bullshit.

316
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:12,646
How ironical.

317
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:14,361
What's that?

318
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:17,166
Dumping an already dead body at a cemetery.

319
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,728
<i>Tuesday. The body of Leila Andresen</i>

320
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:22,770
<i>a 25-year-old Interior Design
major at Brooklyn College</i>

321
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:25,002
<i>was found at Green-Wood Cemetery.</i>

322
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:28,163
<i>Andresen had been missing two days
when Eduardo Solomon,</i>

323
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,802
<i>florist across the street from the cemetery,</i>

324
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,405
<i>found what was later identified</i>

325
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,209
<i>as a portion of the victim's leg</i>

326
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:35,930
<i>in the dumpster behind his shop.</i>

327
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:39,207
<i>That same day, more human remains were found</i>

328
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:42,011
<i>scattered about the cemetery
by a groundskeeper.</i>

329
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,048
<i>Witnesses say Andresen was last seen</i>

330
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,248
<i>getting into a blue van
with three men.</i>

331
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:53,527
<i>Andresen's fiancé, Reuben Quintana,</i>

332
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:56,444
told police that he and Leila
were supposed to meet up for lunch.

333
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:58,806
But she never showed.

334
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:00,761
Good guess.

335
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:02,491
Thanks for your help.

336
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:05,088
- What's this?
- What's what?

337
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:07,370
My time is valuable, man.

338
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:09,370
How valuable?

339
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,645
Ten bucks.

340
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:18,809
Here's $20. Take it easy.

341
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,686
I'm going to go get something to eat.

342
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:32,320
Want a hamburger or something?

343
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,401
I don't eat meat.

344
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,480
Okay. Nice meeting you, TJ.

345
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:45,602
What I'm saying is,
I don't care nothing about cows.

346
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:48,288
I just care about
what I put inside my body.

347
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:51,768
No meat, no soda, no Pringles,
none of that shit.

348
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:55,206
But I was thinking about getting
a little eat on myself.

349
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:58,762
All right. So we can both
get our eat ons together.

350
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,161
Come on.

351
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:06,080
Come on, Watson.

352
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:48,246
<i>Where do you sleep?</i>

353
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,802
Those nights you can't hide in the library?

354
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,970
There's places to stay.

355
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,570
What happened to your parents?

356
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:59,164
You don't gotta feel sorry for me.

357
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:00,881
I don't.

358
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:02,481
Good.

359
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:08,324
You could hire me, though.
Make me your partner.

360
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,243
I don't think so.

361
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,766
Why? You don't think I got what it takes
to be a good detective?

362
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:15,684
I'm sure you do.
I'm just not the partner type.

363
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:20,840
What does it take to be
a good detective anyway?

364
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:22,081
A strong bladder.

365
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:24,041
Seriously.

366
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,845
I don't know what it takes.

367
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:32,607
I don't know. Patience. Instincts.
Uh, blind luck, mostly.

368
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:36,649
And a good name.
A good name is very important.

369
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:40,964
One with real flavor like
Sam Spade or Philip Marlowe.

370
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:43,122
What's wrong with the name you got?

371
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,964
I don't know, man.

372
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:46,849
Thinking something more like

373
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:49,091
Daunte Culpepper.

374
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:51,644
Quarterback for Minnesota?

375
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,771
It's a good name for a detective,

376
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:57,241
but a lame-ass name for a guy
who plays football.

377
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,050
Daunte Culpepper.

378
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:04,641
Yeah. Daunte Culpepper. Private eye.

379
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,324
Now I like that name a lot.

380
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:10,322
Sure you don't want a soda
or something, honey?

381
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:14,051
I know you just love to give
a young black man like myself

382
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:15,610
one of your sperm-killer sodas.

383
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:18,081
But no thank you, ma'am.
I'll just stick with the water.

384
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:26,289
What? They only give sodas
to low-income people.

385
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:28,681
With a bunch of chemicals in them
to sterilize you.

386
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:30,364
That's why I only drink water.

387
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:32,169
A gallon a day and stay hydrated.

388
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:34,001
You don't eat meat?

389
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:36,524
Yeah. So what.
You got a problem with that?

390
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:39,126
Not at all.
My ex-wife, she was vegetarian.

391
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:41,403
So what happened? Why'd you split?

392
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:42,881
What was she? A clucker?

393
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:44,081
A what?

394
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:45,924
A clucker. Chickenhead.

395
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,128
You know, those females that only like you

396
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,446
if you give them nice things.

397
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,682
If you ain't bling-blinging,
you ain't seeing shit.

398
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:53,280
Can't you speak English?

399
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,808
Hit a nerve. Sorry.

400
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:58,205
Wait a minute. What time is it?

401
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:00,330
- Almost 10:00.
- Shit.

402
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:03,324
I gotta get back to the shelter.
It closes at 10:00.

403
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:04,925
Uh, thanks for the pancakes.

404
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:28,481
Jonas Loogan?

405
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:30,367
Yes?

406
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:31,726
You're the gardener here?

407
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:34,724
I'm the groundskeeper.
Can I help you?

408
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:37,128
- I'm Matthew Scudder.
- Whoa!

409
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:40,364
That was fast.
Public affairs lady at the 77th

410
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:42,488
said it would be at least a week
before anyone got back to me.

411
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:43,841
Excuse me?

412
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,968
I just really want the book
to have an authentic feel, you know?

413
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:47,041
Book?

414
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:49,088
That's why this ride along
is so important to me, you know?

415
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:50,605
Spend some real time with real cops?

416
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:56,801
What do you want?

417
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:59,201
I was hoping I could talk to you
about Leila Andresen.

418
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,201
Who?

419
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:03,329
The woman they found over here.

420
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:06,646
Yeah, I don't know anything about that.

421
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,961
Your boss tells me
you were here that day.

422
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,364
- You spoke to Larry?
- Yeah.

423
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:13,927
Great. 'Cause my boss is Gretchen, okay?

424
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:17,008
Oh, boy. I messed up.

425
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:20,241
You're too smart for me, Jonas. Damn.

426
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:22,646
Think you can help me anyway?

427
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:25,089
Already told everything I know
to the police.

428
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:28,441
Eduardo. Guy who owns
the shop across the street,

429
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:30,363
says there were about 20 garbage bags
that were here.

430
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:31,441
That true?

431
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:33,443
Eduardo was wrong.
There were only about 10.

432
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:35,807
And most of those were on
the Fifth Avenue side.

433
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:38,167
And there were four more
floating in the pond down there.

434
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,131
So you saw them?

435
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,650
I saw the pigeon first.

436
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:45,210
Keep a coop on my roof.

437
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:47,526
<i>This was a Helmet.</i>

438
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:48,647
<i>It was alone.</i>

439
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,484
<i>Which, if you know anything at all
about Helmets,</i>

440
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:52,369
<i>is quite unusual for that breed.</i>

441
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:53,851
<i>It was sitting on one of the bags</i>

442
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:56,321
<i>trying to get at whatever was in there.</i>

443
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,970
<i>I just fished them both out
after I was done</i>

444
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:59,326
<i>with the mowing and threw them away.</i>

445
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:00,640
<i>You didn't open them?</i>

446
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:05,167
No. I figured it was all
just some waterlogged trash

447
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:08,084
that kids had thrown in there
the night before.

448
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:09,889
They do that, you know?

449
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:12,167
Throw their rubbers and their empties
into the pond.

450
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:15,843
You see the cops across the street?

451
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,684
Yeah, but I didn't make that connection

452
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:20,240
until Vince came running over
from the Fifth Avenue entrance.

453
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:21,731
Vince.

454
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:23,768
Yeah, he's the other groundskeeper.

455
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:25,171
He's the one that found the bags over there.

456
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:27,448
Is Vince around?
I'd like to talk to him.

457
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:28,561
He quit.

458
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:30,810
He opened one of the bags.

459
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,480
You know, I was just starting
to forget about her.

460
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:40,845
Thank you so much for bringing that all back.

461
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:42,206
What's your book about?

462
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:45,084
Don't patronize me.

463
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,490
Yo, Matt, what's the dealie, man?

464
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:18,560
Hello, TJ.

465
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:19,681
You know I been shadowing you.

466
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:20,841
No kidding.

467
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:23,491
Alright. So, "I followed subject back

468
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:25,449
"from dinner to a meeting at some church."

469
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,285
Used to drink some, huh?

470
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:32,203
"I then followed subject back to some
shitty-assed building on 45th

471
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:33,611
"where subject remained until..."

472
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:35,250
I know where I was, TJ.

473
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,689
You made me at that flower shop, didn't you?

474
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,643
I made you back at the subway.

475
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:41,886
Damn.

476
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:43,883
This book I'm reading
says a foot tail is hard

477
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:46,008
to do on account of they're so easy to spot.

478
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:47,127
That it is.

479
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:48,810
It says it's good to use three guys.

480
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:50,251
Two alternating behind and another guy

481
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:51,367
on the other side of the street.

482
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:53,090
Sure. If you have three guys.

483
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,405
You know you spend a lot of time

484
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:57,562
at churches and you use a lot of payphones.

485
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:58,971
So?

486
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:00,411
So you don't got no cell phone?

487
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:01,481
I don't like them.

488
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:03,483
You don't like computers
and you don't like cell phones.

489
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:06,286
Fucking Amish got more flavor
than you do, Matthew.

490
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:08,685
You know, I watched you follow some dude,

491
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,205
you didn't even try to hide or nothing.

492
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:11,805
He wasn't looking for me.

493
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:14,281
Funny. Me following you
while you following some other guy.

494
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:16,491
It's real ironical.

495
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:28,171
- TJ?
- Yeah?

496
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:29,321
Stop following me.

497
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:36,447
Okay. No. No.

498
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:39,366
Reuben Quintana?

499
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:40,480
I help you with something?

500
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:42,291
My name is Matt Scudder.

501
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:44,641
I was wondering if I could talk to you
about your fiancée?

502
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:46,682
- Fiancée?
- Leila Andresen?

503
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:48,070
Oh, Leila.

504
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:50,244
You know, I kind of have this other place
I have to be...

505
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:51,561
I'll just be a minute.

506
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:53,681
Yeah, okay.

507
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:56,521
Yeah, come on in.

508
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:00,090
I get you something to drink?

509
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:01,571
No, thank you.

510
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:06,369
It must be nice, have the time to work out
in the middle of the day.

511
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:08,011
I'd rather be working.

512
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:10,680
Period. I'm an actor.

513
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:13,328
Yeah, I thought you looked familiar.

514
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:15,209
Have I seen something you've been in?

515
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:17,049
Maybe. I did a Stetson commercial.

516
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:18,121
Few years back.

517
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:19,200
Stetson, the hat?

518
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:20,241
No, the cologne.

519
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:23,206
Ran during the Stanley Cup Finals.

520
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,765
Missed that one.

521
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,883
Leila went to Brooklyn College,
is that right?

522
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,486
Studied decorating?

523
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:31,891
Interior design.

524
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:33,201
Right.

525
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:37,005
You told the police
that it was three men took her.

526
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:38,081
Yeah, that's right.

527
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:39,440
You're sure about that?

528
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:41,249
Yeah. I saw them.

529
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,480
<i>I was at this coffee place on Prospect...</i>

530
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:46,642
<i>She used to meet me there sometimes.</i>

531
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:49,923
<i>...when I see two guys jump out
of the van and grab her.</i>

532
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:53,321
What'd they look like?

533
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:55,040
I couldn't really see their faces.

534
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:57,407
<i>But I could see a third guy
behind the wheel.</i>

535
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:00,601
Move!

536
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:03,528
Hey! What the fuck are you doing?

537
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,240
That's the last time I saw her.

538
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:07,446
This is a nice place.

539
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,205
Lots of nice stuff.

540
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:10,725
Leila do the design?

541
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:13,207
Yeah. You should see the bedroom, it's...

542
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:16,404
Wait, I... That didn't sound right.

543
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:19,368
You don't deal, do you, Reuben?

544
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:21,050
- What?
- You heard me.

545
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:22,520
You asking, am I a drug dealer?

546
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:24,011
Unless you prefer trafficker.

547
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:26,125
Or maybe you wanna tell me you made

548
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:28,202
your money peddling cologne on ESPN.

549
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:29,281
I got a trust fund.

550
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:32,122
- From your rich family up in the Bronx?
- Yeah.

551
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:33,930
My mom won a lawsuit a few years back.

552
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:37,647
Hey, come on, Reuben,
not even the dog's dumb enough to buy that one.

553
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:41,611
Look, I don't care
how you earn your living.

554
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:44,365
But the guys who grabbed Leila?
They might have.

555
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:45,801
How do you mean?

556
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:51,041
How do you mean?

557
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:52,446
Thanks for your time.

558
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:56,651
Thank you.

559
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:20,284
Jonas? Did you forget your key again?

560
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:55,129
What the hell is going on?
Cops showing up

561
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:56,964
to my house asking about Leila.

562
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:58,651
Who the hell is this guy?

563
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:50,527
"He carried her through the field,

564
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:54,922
"the dandelions and cattails
still wet with morning dew,

565
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:57,205
"and set her down by a stream,

566
00:41:57,960 --> 00:41:59,564
"whispering through the strands

567
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:01,529
"of her fine yellow hair,

568
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:05,050
"'You're safe now. You're safe."'

569
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:08,441
Fuck.

570
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:47,641
Jonas.

571
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:52,481
You caught me.

572
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:57,406
You gave the cops a different address,
didn't you?

573
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:00,327
That's why they never put you
across the street from Leila.

574
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:04,887
This is my mother's building.

575
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:08,203
I live in Sunset Park,
but I'm not allowed to keep my birds there.

576
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:10,203
Even though there's room on the roof.

577
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,843
Your mom home right now?
Maybe we could

578
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:15,763
go down and talk,
have a cup of coffee.

579
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:19,205
I can't let you leave here.

580
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:21,690
They'll kill me if I do.

581
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:23,046
Who's "they," Jonas?

582
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:24,161
The other two.

583
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:27,724
So what, you gonna stab me now
with that big fucking knife?

584
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:32,491
It's gonna bother me, too.
For a long time, I know it will.

585
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:34,006
How much is it gonna bother you

586
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:36,447
I take that knife away
and stick it in your neck?

587
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:38,567
Could you really do that?

588
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:40,291
Yeah, I really could.

589
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:41,805
But I'd rather not.

590
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:44,046
How about instead we trade?

591
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:47,247
Okay.

592
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:48,321
Set it down.

593
00:43:58,320 --> 00:43:59,765
What was it I said that gave me away?

594
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:02,446
Everything. You're a weirdo, Jonas.

595
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:05,047
I never laid a hand on Leila.

596
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:08,920
But the other two,
they're the ones you better worry about.

597
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,240
What other two?

598
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:15,121
Jonas.

599
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:19,050
What other two?

600
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:27,606
They're not human.

601
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:31,526
How'd you meet them?

602
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:39,401
<i>There's this video store near my house.</i>

603
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:41,880
<i>They've got this basement
where they keep</i>

604
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:44,924
<i>some of the more specialized stuff.</i>

605
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:47,925
<i>Always came in together.</i>

606
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:52,080
<i>You wouldn't really notice them
unless they spoke to you.</i>

607
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:55,929
<i>One of them had a beard, or a goatee.</i>

608
00:44:56,760 --> 00:44:59,809
<i>The other one smiled a lot.
He did all the talking.</i>

609
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:01,521
What about names?

610
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:04,964
You don't exchange names
in a place like that.

611
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:06,641
Not real ones anyway.

612
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:10,887
They loved that I worked in a cemetery.
Thought it was funny.

613
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:11,961
Wanted to buy me drinks.

614
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:16,040
<i>So we went to this bar
in the middle of the day.</i>

615
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:17,884
<i>Drank rum and Coke.</i>

616
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:20,201
<i>Talked about the different videos we liked.</i>

617
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:22,402
<i>It was all one big laugh to them,</i>

618
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:25,051
<i>watching all the drug addicts
fuck each other.</i>

619
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:27,441
<i>They were, like, obsessed
with that whole world.</i>

620
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:30,007
Dealers, addicts, different kinds of drugs.

621
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:33,450
They told me they worked with the DEA.

622
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:34,841
They were cops?

623
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:36,491
They wouldn't say for sure.

624
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:39,325
They said what they did was secret.

625
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:43,602
But they had one of those
police radios, you know?

626
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:46,209
<i>One of those handheld units.</i>

627
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:49,682
<i>And they had all these files on drug dealers
with DEA stamps on them.</i>

628
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:51,769
Told me they worked on special assignments.

629
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:53,326
You told them about Reuben.

630
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:55,928
I told them about Leila.

631
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:58,529
About how I wanted to save her from Reuben.

632
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:01,567
<i>So we came up here.
We watched them for a while.</i>

633
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:05,527
<i>They said they wanted to help her, too.</i>

634
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:08,443
<i>So you followed her?</i>

635
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:09,800
<i>You picked her up off the street.</i>

636
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:12,521
<i>Then what?</i>

637
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:15,843
We drove around with her.
We finally parked somewhere.

638
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:17,320
<i>Near the water in Brooklyn.</i>

639
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:19,722
<i>Said they wanted to make
their own video.</i>

640
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:22,045
<i>She was really scared.</i>

641
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:23,366
They loved that.

642
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:33,209
You dirty little girl.

643
00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:38,205
<i>They kept talking to her.</i>

644
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:40,210
Pick one. Which one's your favorite?

645
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:42,329
Eeny, meeny, miney, moe.

646
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:45,449
You pick the one that you want to keep,
and I'll take the other.

647
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:49,561
One for you, one for me.
That's fair, isn't it?

648
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:52,931
Well, you better pick one,
or I'm going to take them both.

649
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:56,364
Come on, what are you waiting for?
You trying to stall?

650
00:46:56,440 --> 00:46:57,601
You trying to make me mad?

651
00:46:58,040 --> 00:47:00,202
Touch the one that you want to keep.

652
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:01,521
This one?

653
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:02,921
Okay, good.

654
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:04,810
I think that's an excellent choice.

655
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:08,606
Okay, that's ones yours,
and this one is mine.

656
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:12,084
A deal's a deal. No take backsies.

657
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:19,524
But then two days later,

658
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:21,120
I think they thought it would be funny,

659
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:24,090
I show up for work
and there's garbage bags everywhere.

660
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:27,122
They knew I'd never say anything.

661
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:29,242
Where was this video place
you met these two?

662
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:30,726
It moves around a lot.

663
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:32,365
Might still be there. Who knows?

664
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:33,441
How do I get in?

665
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:34,926
It helps if they know you.

666
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:36,566
What if you come with me?

667
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:43,688
Can I feed my birds first?

668
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:02,921
Ray.

669
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:04,845
What was that?

670
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:08,410
That was his name.

671
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:10,960
Which one? The quiet one, or the...

672
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:17,926
Jesus.

673
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:28,921
<i>I was off-duty one day
in this bar in Washington Heights</i>

674
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,321
<i>where cops didn't have
to pay for their drinks.</i>

675
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:35,131
<i>And a couple of guys came in
to rob the place.</i>

676
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:38,891
<i>I chased them into the street,
shot two dead,</i>

677
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:42,008
<i>got a third one in the leg.</i>

678
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:44,284
<i>He'll never walk right again.</i>

679
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:48,601
Yeah. I quit drinking that day.

680
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:54,401
It just wasn't as much fun after that.

681
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:01,764
People are afraid of all the wrong things.

682
00:50:31,120 --> 00:50:32,406
I'll be right back.

683
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:32,000
I wonder if he'd pay
as much for the nurse?

684
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:35,848
We made a mistake.
Come on, let's go.

685
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:43,321
Wait, wait.

686
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:36,962
<i>They work for the fucking DEA?</i>

687
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:40,123
<i>Probably not for very long
and almost certainly not as agents.</i>

688
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:41,240
Then what were they?

689
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:42,327
I don't know.

690
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:44,289
Maybe they were used
as confidential informants

691
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:45,885
or maybe they were office staff.

692
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:*****5
Whatever they were, they couldn't have

693
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:49,329
gone very far or lasted very long.

694
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:52,165
- Why not?
- Because they're insane.

695
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:54,163
They managed to get their hands
on some files.

696
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:55,605
One of which had my name on it.

697
00:52:55,880 --> 00:52:57,644
And if my name's on a DEA file,

698
00:52:57,720 --> 00:52:58,926
that means I'm being looked at, right?

699
00:52:59,080 --> 00:53:00,650
Or you were at one time.

700
00:53:01,880 --> 00:53:03,962
You know a lot of people,
do what you do?

701
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:08,766
It's not like we have a union or anything,
but I know a few. Why?

702
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:11,451
I want you to call them
and tell them what happened to Carrie.

703
00:53:11,560 --> 00:53:12,527
Tell them you've hired a...

704
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:14,170
Are you fucking kidding me?

705
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:16,520
Word gets out about Carrie,
cops are gonna be...

706
00:53:16,600 --> 00:53:18,170
They've done this before.

707
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:19,605
And they're gonna do it again.

708
00:53:19,720 --> 00:53:21,290
This time I wanna hear about it.

709
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:23,126
What do I say?

710
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:25,525
You'll think of something.

711
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:28,281
I could have paid them.

712
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:31,851
I had the whole million.

713
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:35,161
It was our nest egg.

714
00:53:35,240 --> 00:53:37,447
You know, the money I was gonna use
to get out.

715
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:40,444
And this guy I know,
he was gonna put me into some Internet startup,

716
00:53:40,520 --> 00:53:42,170
sell shoes online or some bullshit.

717
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:44,607
It was our future
and I didn't want to give it to them.

718
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:46,444
Now how fucking stupid is that?

719
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:48,131
She was already dead.

720
00:53:49,160 --> 00:53:51,811
If she wasn't,
they would have killed her anyway.

721
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:53,845
Call your friends.

722
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:48,047
<i>Gotteskind?</i>

723
00:54:49,120 --> 00:54:50,963
I just knew her as Marie.

724
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:53,728
Jacinto. My man.

725
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:56,530
You know where it is.

726
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:00,571
She lived around here?

727
00:55:01,560 --> 00:55:02,641
She worked around here.

728
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:03,767
Where?

729
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:05,160
On the corner.

730
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:08,606
No, no, your mama likes the one percent,
not the two.

731
00:55:10,520 --> 00:55:11,601
She was a dealer?

732
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:16,482
She worked out of a crib
not too far from here,

733
00:55:16,560 --> 00:55:17,891
if you know what I mean.

734
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:28,610
See that old building down the block

735
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:30,290
with the vacuum repair on the ground?

736
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:46,041
<i>Hola.</i>

737
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:49,925
All right, tell me, cocksucker,

738
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:51,411
what do you want with Marie G?

739
00:56:55,560 --> 00:56:56,846
You on the job, fucker?

740
00:56:57,360 --> 00:56:58,361
Retired.

741
00:56:58,440 --> 00:57:00,124
Who you working for, the family?

742
00:57:00,760 --> 00:57:03,570
Shit. When are you guys
gonna leave it alone, huh?

743
00:57:03,640 --> 00:57:04,687
We didn't do it, okay?

744
00:57:04,760 --> 00:57:05,761
Okay.

745
00:57:05,840 --> 00:57:07,126
You think we'd just chop up a cop

746
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:09,089
and leave her on our own fucking doorstep?

747
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:11,640
My son's a fucking moron
but he's not an idiot.

748
00:57:13,320 --> 00:57:14,651
Wait. Marie was a cop?

749
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:17,161
Who are you?

750
00:57:18,120 --> 00:57:20,521
I'm not after you.
Or your son.

751
00:57:22,840 --> 00:57:24,126
I want...

752
00:57:26,600 --> 00:57:29,171
I want the guys that killed Marie.

753
00:57:29,240 --> 00:57:30,844
Not if I kill 'em first.

754
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:34,289
You dealing outta the store?

755
00:57:34,360 --> 00:57:35,361
Not anymore.

756
00:57:36,560 --> 00:57:38,164
But she was working you?

757
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:41,406
Working him?

758
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:42,965
Fucking moron wanted to marry her.

759
00:57:43,840 --> 00:57:45,285
That's how good she was.

760
00:57:54,560 --> 00:57:56,369
<i>Hello, my name's Peter.</i>

761
00:57:56,920 --> 00:58:00,163
I'm an alcoholic and still a drug addict,

762
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:01,765
and I got one day back.

763
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:03,086
Hi, Peter.

764
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:05,647
It's good to see
all the friendly faces again.

765
00:58:05,720 --> 00:58:07,961
Still haven't managed
to turn your back on me.

766
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:11,681
So I slipped, you know?

767
00:58:11,800 --> 00:58:13,006
It happens.

768
00:58:13,080 --> 00:58:15,242
The funny thing is I didn't start using
until I was 28.

769
00:58:15,320 --> 00:58:16,321
Yeah?

770
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:18,209
Up until then,
I never even smoked a joint.

771
00:58:18,280 --> 00:58:19,770
Even when I was overseas, you know,

772
00:58:19,840 --> 00:58:21,444
half my unit was on one thing or another.

773
00:58:21,560 --> 00:58:22,846
You were in the army?

774
00:58:22,920 --> 00:58:24,922
Yeah, I was in Germany,
then Desert Storm.

775
00:58:25,600 --> 00:58:27,682
I come home, go back to school,

776
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:29,000
and me and Kenny, we start dealing.

777
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:32,527
Just enough to get by.
It was more Kenny's thing.

778
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:35,126
He was dealing in college.

779
00:58:35,240 --> 00:58:36,685
I do it to pay for art school.

780
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:38,364
Wind up getting hooked on the product.

781
00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:39,646
Drop out.

782
00:58:39,720 --> 00:58:41,449
Meanwhile, Kenny, he stays in the business,

783
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:43,124
starts making some real money

784
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:46,443
while I'm eating garbage
and sleeping in abandoned buildings.

785
00:58:46,520 --> 00:58:49,808
Till one night I nearly blew
my fucking heart out of my mouth up in Harlem.

786
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:51,081
What are you gonna do now?

787
00:58:51,720 --> 00:58:54,166
I got this job as a bread maker.

788
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:56,925
Figure stay busy at night,
sleep during the day.

789
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:58,240
Get in less trouble.

790
00:59:00,520 --> 00:59:01,806
All right. See you around.

791
00:59:01,880 --> 00:59:02,881
Take it easy.

792
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:06,160
<i>The number you have reached
is not in service. Please check...</i>

793
00:59:08,280 --> 00:59:09,327
<i>Directory assistance.</i>

794
00:59:09,480 --> 00:59:13,201
I'd like the number for the
East Village Plumbing, please.

795
00:59:13,320 --> 00:59:14,320
<i>What borough?</i>

796
00:59:14,360 --> 00:59:15,725
I assume it's the East Village.

797
00:59:15,800 --> 00:59:16,881
<i>One moment.</i>

798
00:59:17,640 --> 00:59:19,608
- <i>No listing in Manhattan.</i>
- Try Brooklyn.

799
00:59:20,440 --> 00:59:21,646
<i>Nothing in Brooklyn either.</i>

800
00:59:21,720 --> 00:59:22,881
Try all the boroughs.

801
00:59:24,520 --> 00:59:25,726
<i>I'm sorry, we have no listing.</i>

802
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:27,006
Thanks.

803
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:49,960
What happened to you?

804
00:59:50,040 --> 00:59:51,849
I bumped into something.
You okay?

805
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:54,001
I'm fine.

806
00:59:54,760 --> 00:59:56,762
- What you got there in your backpack?
- Nothing.

807
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,890
Just my notebook. Some Twizzlers.

808
00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:01,640
Unless you're talking
about my pencil case.

809
01:00:01,840 --> 01:00:04,764
No. I'm talking about the black Beretta
with the taped grip

810
01:00:04,840 --> 01:00:06,444
you got tucked beside
your water bottle.

811
01:00:08,840 --> 01:00:09,841
You mean this.

812
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:11,481
My new jammie.

813
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:15,526
It's a nice one.

814
01:00:15,600 --> 01:00:17,284
What are you planning on doing with it?

815
01:00:17,360 --> 01:00:19,886
I don't know, man.
Right now it's just for protection.

816
01:00:19,960 --> 01:00:23,328
Figure, I'm gonna be a detective,
I need a piece.

817
01:00:24,080 --> 01:00:25,403
Where'd you get it?

818
01:00:25,480 --> 01:00:27,642
I was just taking a nap in some alley.

819
01:00:28,320 --> 01:00:30,641
Heard some footsteps.
I seen some dude who works

820
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:32,245
as a lookout for some ballers.

821
01:00:32,320 --> 01:00:34,891
He just threw the bag
in a dumpster and split.

822
01:00:35,880 --> 01:00:37,450
You stole someone's stash?

823
01:00:38,440 --> 01:00:41,410
I didn't steal it.
I left the money and the rock where it was.

824
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:45,007
They're going to come back for the piece,
you know that.

825
01:00:45,120 --> 01:00:48,203
Naw. They're in the wind, Matthew.
Trust me.

826
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:50,344
Cops clipped their ass.

827
01:00:52,120 --> 01:00:53,690
You know how to use that?

828
01:00:54,680 --> 01:00:55,920
Shit.

829
01:00:57,200 --> 01:00:59,328
Point it at me.
Like you're gonna shoot me.

830
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:01,961
Go ahead.

831
01:01:03,240 --> 01:01:04,241
Come on.

832
01:01:07,960 --> 01:01:09,166
That the way you hold a gun?

833
01:01:10,080 --> 01:01:11,570
That's the way I hold it, yeah.

834
01:01:12,320 --> 01:01:15,403
You know how to jack the clip?
Empty it? Clean it?

835
01:01:20,680 --> 01:01:23,604
But the gun's still not empty.
You know that, right?

836
01:01:24,440 --> 01:01:26,640
You know there's still a round left
in the chamber here?

837
01:01:27,400 --> 01:01:28,640
Now. Put it back together.

838
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:37,801
Caress it.

839
01:01:37,960 --> 01:01:39,803
Rub it, like it's part of you.

840
01:01:42,320 --> 01:01:43,890
Feels good, doesn't it?

841
01:01:44,640 --> 01:01:45,687
Word.

842
01:01:46,040 --> 01:01:47,385
It's all oily and whatnot.

843
01:01:48,120 --> 01:01:49,281
Turn off the safety.

844
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:53,961
Now cock it.

845
01:01:59,360 --> 01:02:02,330
Now put it to your temple
and pull the fucking trigger.

846
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:05,091
- What?
- You heard me.

847
01:02:05,720 --> 01:02:07,051
Shoot yourself in the head.

848
01:02:07,320 --> 01:02:08,890
Might as well get it over with now.

849
01:02:09,240 --> 01:02:10,685
Because you walk around with a gun,

850
01:02:10,760 --> 01:02:13,366
sooner or later, it's gonna happen anyway.

851
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:17,286
No rewind. No going out for popcorn
and coming back to the show.

852
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:21,686
It's just you with that gun in your hand,
stupid look on your face,

853
01:02:21,800 --> 01:02:23,165
and your hash all over the wall.

854
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:27,331
Take it easy now, TJ.

855
01:03:17,680 --> 01:03:18,681
Fuck!

856
01:03:24,360 --> 01:03:26,647
Scudder, I'm assuming you're not

857
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:28,160
dumb enough to shoot a federal agent.

858
01:03:28,320 --> 01:03:29,651
Show me your badge. Right now.

859
01:03:29,720 --> 01:03:30,721
Okay.

860
01:03:30,800 --> 01:03:32,245
I'm reaching for my folder.

861
01:03:34,840 --> 01:03:37,207
Stover. Drug Enforcement.

862
01:03:37,880 --> 01:03:38,881
Put it down.

863
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:41,524
Great. It's broken.

864
01:03:41,600 --> 01:03:43,125
Next time identify yourself.

865
01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:44,531
Hey, maybe we should pull over,

866
01:03:44,600 --> 01:03:47,206
try again this time without the sucker punch,
see how well you do.

867
01:03:47,320 --> 01:03:48,321
Why wait?

868
01:03:48,840 --> 01:03:49,966
Hey, that's enough.

869
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:52,450
Who you working for? Kenny Kristo?

870
01:03:52,920 --> 01:03:54,843
- I can't say.
- Cut it out, Scudder.

871
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:57,521
You're not licensed
so you don't have privilege.

872
01:03:57,600 --> 01:03:58,601
And you're retired,

873
01:03:58,680 --> 01:04:00,887
so this gives you about
as much legal authority

874
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:02,121
as a fucking mailman.

875
01:04:03,240 --> 01:04:04,605
So the sooner you tell me
what you're doing

876
01:04:04,680 --> 01:04:05,966
hanging with known drug dealers,

877
01:04:06,040 --> 01:04:08,486
the sooner you can get to an AA meeting
and not talk about it.

878
01:04:08,800 --> 01:04:11,406
I'm trying to find Ray
and his buddy what's-his-name.

879
01:04:11,880 --> 01:04:14,247
You know, the two guys
that killed Marie Gotteskind?

880
01:04:14,520 --> 01:04:15,567
I don't know who you mean.

881
01:04:15,760 --> 01:04:17,205
Really? They go around saying

882
01:04:17,280 --> 01:04:19,248
they're on the DEA payroll.

883
01:04:19,320 --> 01:04:22,085
Usually right before they chop someone
into little pieces.

884
01:04:22,320 --> 01:04:24,209
Was Gotteskind looking at Kenny Kristo?

885
01:04:24,280 --> 01:04:25,281
I can't answer that.

886
01:04:25,600 --> 01:04:27,284
Maybe Mrs. Kristo can.

887
01:04:27,720 --> 01:04:30,485
Although we haven't seen her around
for a while, have we, guys?

888
01:04:31,160 --> 01:04:32,366
I know,

889
01:04:32,440 --> 01:04:35,091
maybe you should talk to the brother, Peter.

890
01:04:35,160 --> 01:04:37,561
Seeing as he used to spend
a lot of time over there.

891
01:04:38,720 --> 01:04:39,721
Know what?

892
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:41,606
I was wrong.

893
01:04:41,680 --> 01:04:44,126
This guy doesn't know a fucking thing.
Uncuff him.

894
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:47,364
We're done here.

895
01:05:20,280 --> 01:05:22,408
In the program, they have this saying.

896
01:05:23,320 --> 01:05:25,766
"Don't give up five minutes
before the miracle happens."

897
01:05:26,040 --> 01:05:27,041
Scudder.

898
01:05:27,520 --> 01:05:28,760
Of course the flip side of that one is,

899
01:05:28,840 --> 01:05:30,842
if you do give up,
you'll never know.

900
01:05:31,040 --> 01:05:32,041
What are you doing here?

901
01:05:36,440 --> 01:05:37,922
I'm admiring your wallpaper.

902
01:05:40,040 --> 01:05:42,771
Those are the studies I was doing
for the painting.

903
01:05:43,040 --> 01:05:44,041
You do them all here?

904
01:05:44,120 --> 01:05:45,451
Yeah. We had to.

905
01:05:45,520 --> 01:05:48,171
Wanted it to be a surprise for Kenny.

906
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:50,641
Was he? Surprised?

907
01:05:52,120 --> 01:05:53,167
What do you want, man?

908
01:05:54,080 --> 01:05:55,730
You and Carrie put the DEA

909
01:05:55,800 --> 01:05:57,000
onto your brother, didn't you?

910
01:05:57,680 --> 01:05:58,681
Hey.

911
01:05:58,840 --> 01:06:01,161
I wouldn't blame you
for hating the guy. I mean,

912
01:06:01,240 --> 01:06:03,288
it's not just that he has
a beautiful wife,

913
01:06:03,360 --> 01:06:05,328
it's not just that he's got
all that money,

914
01:06:05,440 --> 01:06:09,001
while you work some
get-well job making donuts.

915
01:06:09,080 --> 01:06:11,048
What would really get me

916
01:06:11,840 --> 01:06:13,922
is how he can be around all that junk

917
01:06:15,040 --> 01:06:16,246
and never use.

918
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:21,089
Carrie had nothing to do with it.

919
01:06:25,760 --> 01:06:29,207
About nine months ago,
they go to Bermuda for their anniversary.

920
01:06:30,520 --> 01:06:32,727
Carrie asked me to watch the house.

921
01:06:34,160 --> 01:06:35,446
I'm there maybe a day.

922
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:38,562
Found some cash Kenny hadn't locked up.

923
01:06:38,680 --> 01:06:40,250
I don't even think about it.

924
01:06:40,320 --> 01:06:42,971
I go to Queens,
to this guy I know to score.

925
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:44,361
And you get busted?

926
01:06:44,720 --> 01:06:47,724
Yeah. I get put in a room
with this woman DEA agent.

927
01:06:49,800 --> 01:06:51,529
She's so nice to me, you know.

928
01:06:52,680 --> 01:06:54,045
I give Kenny up like that.

929
01:06:54,360 --> 01:06:56,800
Of course, it didn't help
that you were in love with his wife.

930
01:06:57,760 --> 01:07:00,650
Sometimes I think Kenny left
that money out on purpose.

931
01:07:01,240 --> 01:07:03,766
Yeah. I'm sure that's what he did.

932
01:07:05,680 --> 01:07:09,287
I'm sure this is all exactly
what he wanted to happen.

933
01:07:09,360 --> 01:07:10,725
What are you talking about?

934
01:07:10,800 --> 01:07:13,280
That agent that busted you, the nice one,

935
01:07:14,360 --> 01:07:16,203
her name was Marie Gotteskind.

936
01:07:18,200 --> 01:07:20,160
She was killed by the same two men
who got Carrie.

937
01:07:21,120 --> 01:07:22,201
How did they know about that...

938
01:07:22,280 --> 01:07:23,281
They stole her files.

939
01:07:23,680 --> 01:07:25,921
And one of them, thanks to you,
had Kenny's name in it.

940
01:07:31,720 --> 01:07:33,370
Tell your brother I'm done.

941
01:07:34,040 --> 01:07:35,883
I'll return his money tomorrow.

942
01:07:36,560 --> 01:07:38,164
Does Kenny know about me?

943
01:07:38,800 --> 01:07:40,165
Not unless you tell him.

944
01:07:51,160 --> 01:07:52,161
Yo.

945
01:07:52,240 --> 01:07:53,680
There goes his bitch-ass right there.

946
01:07:54,240 --> 01:07:55,605
Roll up next to him, man.

947
01:07:55,680 --> 01:07:58,729
Yo, TJ! Feeling those new Timbs
you're rocking, man.

948
01:07:59,240 --> 01:08:01,083
I know you hear me talking to you, right?

949
01:08:01,160 --> 01:08:02,685
Let's go fuck this boy up.

950
01:08:06,440 --> 01:08:08,966
- Yo, slow your ass down!
- Whoa, whoa! What's up? What's up?

951
01:08:09,480 --> 01:08:11,209
Yo, you got something
that belongs to me, man.

952
01:08:11,280 --> 01:08:12,281
What you all talking about, man?

953
01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:14,240
Where my Gat at, man?
That's my favorite piece!

954
01:08:14,280 --> 01:08:15,520
Man, I threw it in the fucking river, man. I...

955
01:08:15,600 --> 01:08:16,601
What?

956
01:08:16,680 --> 01:08:17,806
Serious, man?

957
01:08:17,880 --> 01:08:19,600
The fuck you mean
you threw it in the river?

958
01:08:19,640 --> 01:08:21,449
Where you going?
We just want to talk to you.

959
01:08:21,520 --> 01:08:22,521
Get back here, bitch.

960
01:08:22,600 --> 01:08:24,204
- Yo, run his fucking bag.
- Give me that!

961
01:08:26,520 --> 01:08:27,726
Yo, what's this cartoon shit?

962
01:08:27,880 --> 01:08:29,006
No, no, no!

963
01:08:29,280 --> 01:08:30,281
- No, man, that's my...
- Shut up!

964
01:08:30,360 --> 01:08:31,407
Yo, where you get this money from?

965
01:08:31,560 --> 01:08:33,005
- It's my allowance!
- You sell my Gat?

966
01:08:33,080 --> 01:08:34,684
- No!
- Yo, take his fucking Timbs off, man.

967
01:08:35,360 --> 01:08:36,441
No, man.

968
01:08:36,920 --> 01:08:38,251
What the fuck? Yo, motherfucker!

969
01:08:38,320 --> 01:08:40,243
- Fuck, I'm going to kill his bitch ass!
- Fucking A!

970
01:08:40,560 --> 01:08:43,240
- What's wrong with you?
- You crazy? You outta your mind?

971
01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:46,967
Any messages?

972
01:08:49,560 --> 01:08:50,561
Yeah. JR called.

973
01:08:50,680 --> 01:08:51,681
TJ?

974
01:08:52,480 --> 01:08:53,811
Yeah, whatever.

975
01:08:53,880 --> 01:08:54,961
Did he leave a message?

976
01:08:55,680 --> 01:08:57,648
Let me think. No.

977
01:08:58,440 --> 01:08:59,441
Well, yeah.

978
01:08:59,800 --> 01:09:00,801
He's at Bellevue.

979
01:09:03,440 --> 01:09:04,851
He got worked over pretty good.

980
01:09:05,200 --> 01:09:06,770
But he was also out in the rain.

981
01:09:07,080 --> 01:09:08,161
Either one could have triggered the crisis.

982
01:09:08,240 --> 01:09:09,241
Crisis?

983
01:09:09,360 --> 01:09:10,361
He's a sickler.

984
01:09:11,120 --> 01:09:12,724
He's got sickle cell anemia.

985
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:15,204
- You didn't know that?
- No.

986
01:09:15,280 --> 01:09:17,681
Well, a sickler gets a cold or a chill.

987
01:09:17,760 --> 01:09:20,604
Anything that makes a normal person's
blood cell count go up,

988
01:09:20,760 --> 01:09:22,842
any time the body gets ready
to fight something,

989
01:09:22,920 --> 01:09:24,285
the red blood cells panic,

990
01:09:24,360 --> 01:09:25,964
and they take on a sickle shape.

991
01:09:26,040 --> 01:09:27,610
Actually create a kind of a traffic jam

992
01:09:27,680 --> 01:09:29,011
in the arteries.

993
01:09:29,080 --> 01:09:30,570
The blood gets very thick.

994
01:09:30,680 --> 01:09:32,250
Suddenly, you're not getting any oxygen.

995
01:09:32,400 --> 01:09:33,526
What are you doing for him?

996
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:34,921
Well,

997
01:09:35,160 --> 01:09:37,527
we're hydrating him,
giving him Demerol for the pain.

998
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:38,647
But he knew the drill.

999
01:09:38,720 --> 01:09:40,484
He got in here early enough,
so I don't think

1000
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:42,164
it'll go on for too long.

1001
01:09:42,280 --> 01:09:43,691
I'll be right out there if you need me.

1002
01:09:43,760 --> 01:09:45,125
Thanks, doctor.

1003
01:09:58,080 --> 01:09:59,570
Don't feel sorry for me.

1004
01:10:00,920 --> 01:10:01,921
I don't.

1005
01:10:05,960 --> 01:10:07,564
How long I gotta be here for, man?

1006
01:10:07,720 --> 01:10:09,404
Depends how well you behave.

1007
01:10:11,320 --> 01:10:14,403
You know, my mom told me once
that I got special blood.

1008
01:10:14,520 --> 01:10:16,045
That I can never catch malaria.

1009
01:10:16,720 --> 01:10:18,643
That's how sickle cell got started.

1010
01:10:18,720 --> 01:10:20,688
In Africa. As a defense against malaria.

1011
01:10:21,160 --> 01:10:22,605
Where is your mother, TJ?

1012
01:10:23,800 --> 01:10:25,245
Why aren't you a cop no more?

1013
01:10:25,320 --> 01:10:26,321
You first.

1014
01:10:30,240 --> 01:10:33,722
I had a crisis one time.
I was about 11.

1015
01:10:33,800 --> 01:10:35,450
My mom took me to the hospital,

1016
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:38,046
but never came back to check me out.

1017
01:10:38,120 --> 01:10:39,724
I guess she thought that
if she left me there

1018
01:10:39,800 --> 01:10:42,565
they'd put me with a really nice family.

1019
01:10:42,640 --> 01:10:43,971
Little did she know.

1020
01:10:44,880 --> 01:10:49,647
I saw her in the street a few times
after that, but that was a while ago.

1021
01:10:50,680 --> 01:10:52,170
She had some issues then.

1022
01:10:53,440 --> 01:10:54,566
Your turn.

1023
01:10:55,720 --> 01:10:57,609
I was off duty one day.

1024
01:10:58,760 --> 01:11:00,762
I was in a bar in Washington Heights where

1025
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:02,524
cops didn't have to pay for their drinks.

1026
01:11:02,600 --> 01:11:03,601
Wait a minute.

1027
01:11:03,920 --> 01:11:05,809
<i>Three kids held up the place.</i>

1028
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:11,242
<i>On their way out,
they shot the bartender in the heart.</i>

1029
01:11:11,320 --> 01:11:13,288
<i>I chased them out into the street,</i>

1030
01:11:14,440 --> 01:11:17,489
<i>and I shot two dead,
caught the other one in the thigh.</i>

1031
01:11:17,640 --> 01:11:19,210
- I heard this already.
- No.

1032
01:11:19,400 --> 01:11:20,526
You didn't.

1033
01:11:22,280 --> 01:11:23,281
You see,

1034
01:11:24,040 --> 01:11:25,041
one shot...

1035
01:11:25,520 --> 01:11:28,046
<i>Well, the bullet took a bad hop.</i>

1036
01:11:48,720 --> 01:11:50,882
<i>It hit a 7-year-old girl in the eye.</i>

1037
01:11:52,040 --> 01:11:53,405
<i>Killed her instantly.</i>

1038
01:11:54,160 --> 01:11:56,208
<i>An inch higher and it
would have grazed her head.</i>

1039
01:11:56,880 --> 01:11:58,848
<i>Left a nasty scar. That's all.</i>

1040
01:11:59,200 --> 01:12:01,202
So wait, they quit your ass

1041
01:12:01,280 --> 01:12:03,282
after you took on three bangers by yourself?

1042
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:07,881
They gave me a commendation.
I quit my own ass.

1043
01:12:09,400 --> 01:12:11,323
I never met anybody that tight before.

1044
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:12,921
Tight?

1045
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:14,001
Brave.

1046
01:12:15,920 --> 01:12:17,081
I wasn't brave.

1047
01:12:19,400 --> 01:12:20,765
I was just drunk.

1048
01:12:23,920 --> 01:12:25,524
Don't feel sorry for me.

1049
01:12:28,880 --> 01:12:30,006
I don't.

1050
01:12:36,760 --> 01:12:38,250
Now, please.

1051
01:13:19,920 --> 01:13:21,001
Watson?

1052
01:13:38,680 --> 01:13:39,886
Watson?

1053
01:14:12,920 --> 01:14:14,729
You don't know how lucky you are.

1054
01:14:24,560 --> 01:14:25,561
Scudder.

1055
01:14:42,080 --> 01:14:43,081
Hello?

1056
01:14:48,080 --> 01:14:49,081
Kenny?

1057
01:14:52,960 --> 01:14:54,086
Anybody home?

1058
01:15:04,920 --> 01:15:06,126
And where've you been?

1059
01:15:09,640 --> 01:15:11,529
- Been trying to call you.
- Where's Kenny?

1060
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:13,126
Whitestone.

1061
01:15:13,200 --> 01:15:14,725
With a friend who says he's having

1062
01:15:14,800 --> 01:15:16,689
the same kind of problem as Kenny had.

1063
01:15:16,920 --> 01:15:17,921
The wife?

1064
01:15:18,600 --> 01:15:19,601
Worse.

1065
01:15:26,840 --> 01:15:28,410
I don't got that kind of money.

1066
01:15:33,680 --> 01:15:34,841
You're the detective?

1067
01:15:34,920 --> 01:15:35,967
Matt Scudder.

1068
01:15:36,280 --> 01:15:39,807
Hello. Dani, why don't you go outside
and keep an eye out.

1069
01:15:39,880 --> 01:15:41,086
That's a good boy.

1070
01:15:43,120 --> 01:15:44,884
Now I post guards.

1071
01:15:45,360 --> 01:15:49,365
The horse is stolen, so I lock the barn.
For what? Huh?

1072
01:15:49,680 --> 01:15:52,524
What can they take from me now?
She's 14 years old.

1073
01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:54,609
Fourteen.

1074
01:15:54,680 --> 01:15:56,569
This is Anna, the nurse.

1075
01:15:58,560 --> 01:16:01,882
They took her last night
and call us in the morning

1076
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:04,529
and tell us not to call the police.

1077
01:16:05,480 --> 01:16:06,891
I remember Kenny calling the other day,

1078
01:16:06,960 --> 01:16:09,247
so I put two and two together.

1079
01:16:09,360 --> 01:16:12,409
Mr. Landau, listen,
you have to know that...

1080
01:16:12,600 --> 01:16:13,886
I'm sorry, what's your daughter's name?

1081
01:16:14,040 --> 01:16:16,884
Ludmilla. But she calls herself Lucia.

1082
01:16:17,840 --> 01:16:19,842
You have to know
that the men who took Lucia

1083
01:16:19,920 --> 01:16:23,481
have already killed at least two women,
including Kenny's wife.

1084
01:16:24,840 --> 01:16:26,080
As things stand,

1085
01:16:26,160 --> 01:16:27,400
they haven't got the slightest intention

1086
01:16:27,520 --> 01:16:29,522
of releasing your daughter alive.

1087
01:16:30,520 --> 01:16:31,806
In fact,

1088
01:16:31,880 --> 01:16:33,962
there's a strong possibility
that she's already dead.

1089
01:16:34,040 --> 01:16:35,849
- No...
- The police know about these two.

1090
01:16:36,040 --> 01:16:37,610
They know who they are,
they know what they're doing.

1091
01:16:37,680 --> 01:16:39,011
No, no, no police.

1092
01:16:39,520 --> 01:16:42,444
You have to help me.
Kenny said you would. I'll pay.

1093
01:16:43,160 --> 01:16:44,491
I'll do whatever you ask.

1094
01:16:45,520 --> 01:16:46,681
Please.

1095
01:16:54,880 --> 01:16:55,927
Hello?

1096
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,080
<i>Okay, you know what happens next?</i>

1097
01:16:58,160 --> 01:17:00,891
Yes, I'm trying. I'm working on it.

1098
01:17:00,960 --> 01:17:03,361
<i>Well, work harder, Yuri.
We want our money.</i>

1099
01:17:03,480 --> 01:17:04,811
I just need some time, please.

1100
01:17:04,880 --> 01:17:05,961
I'll give you whatever you want,

1101
01:17:06,040 --> 01:17:07,565
but please, the one thing I want

1102
01:17:07,640 --> 01:17:09,040
is to talk to my daughter. I just...

1103
01:17:09,080 --> 01:17:10,127
<i>She can't talk right now.</i>

1104
01:17:10,200 --> 01:17:11,920
You gotta let me talk to her.
Just let me...

1105
01:17:12,880 --> 01:17:14,723
If she's dead, you get nothing.

1106
01:17:15,280 --> 01:17:17,203
<i>And who the fuck are you?</i>

1107
01:17:17,400 --> 01:17:20,404
I'm the best chance you've got
if you wanna get your money.

1108
01:17:20,800 --> 01:17:22,882
But the girl's gotta be alive
and all in one piece

1109
01:17:22,960 --> 01:17:24,962
for any kind of deal to happen.

1110
01:17:25,240 --> 01:17:27,129
Are you listening, motherfucker?

1111
01:17:28,560 --> 01:17:30,024
<i>Fuck this shit.</i>

1112
01:17:33,400 --> 01:17:35,289
I can't believe you
talked to him like that.

1113
01:17:35,360 --> 01:17:36,566
He knows what he's doing.

1114
01:17:36,640 --> 01:17:38,722
The important thing right now
is to keep Lucia alive.

1115
01:17:38,920 --> 01:17:40,331
That means these guys have to know

1116
01:17:40,400 --> 01:17:41,686
that they can't get a nickel out of you

1117
01:17:41,800 --> 01:17:43,325
until we first know that she's okay.

1118
01:17:43,400 --> 01:17:45,448
- But if you make them mad...
- They're already mad.

1119
01:17:45,520 --> 01:17:47,284
But you'll give them
an excuse to kill her.

1120
01:17:47,360 --> 01:17:48,691
They don't need an excuse.

1121
01:17:48,760 --> 01:17:49,960
They're gonna kill her anyway.

1122
01:17:50,600 --> 01:17:52,967
What they need is a reason
to keep her alive.

1123
01:17:53,600 --> 01:17:54,886
How much cash have you got?

1124
01:17:54,960 --> 01:17:56,320
I got damn little right now, but...

1125
01:17:56,800 --> 01:17:58,165
Do these bastards want cocaine?

1126
01:17:58,240 --> 01:18:00,129
Because I got 15 kilos
10 minutes from here.

1127
01:18:01,600 --> 01:18:02,726
I don't know.

1128
01:18:02,800 --> 01:18:05,565
Maybe I could get my hands
on a few hundred in counterfeit, but...

1129
01:18:05,640 --> 01:18:07,369
I can't guarantee the quality,

1130
01:18:07,440 --> 01:18:08,566
and I'd have to return it.

1131
01:18:08,640 --> 01:18:10,927
I got at least five hundred in cash.

1132
01:18:12,400 --> 01:18:13,811
Time comes, I'll go get it.

1133
01:18:14,280 --> 01:18:16,009
Is there another line I can use?

1134
01:18:16,920 --> 01:18:18,922
There's a phone in my daughter's room.

1135
01:18:24,840 --> 01:18:27,047
<i>Culpepper Investigations. Daunte speaking.</i>

1136
01:18:27,120 --> 01:18:28,121
Where the hell are you?

1137
01:18:28,520 --> 01:18:30,010
I'm in my office, man.
What's up?

1138
01:18:30,240 --> 01:18:31,446
Why'd you leave the hospital?

1139
01:18:31,840 --> 01:18:33,729
I didn't want some Social Services person

1140
01:18:33,800 --> 01:18:35,643
to come haul my ass away
to a foster home.

1141
01:18:35,720 --> 01:18:36,926
<i>I need you to do me a favor</i>

1142
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:38,729
and get me something out of my apartment.

1143
01:18:38,800 --> 01:18:39,847
<i>What's going on?</i>

1144
01:18:40,120 --> 01:18:43,647
There's a box up in my closet.
I want you to get it for me.

1145
01:18:43,760 --> 01:18:45,762
The kid at the front desk
will let you up.

1146
01:18:46,120 --> 01:18:48,521
<i>Apartment 11G. Key's above the door.</i>

1147
01:18:48,840 --> 01:18:52,242
A guy named Peter will meet you out front.
Give it to him.

1148
01:18:52,320 --> 01:18:54,209
And then go back to
whatever it is you're doing.

1149
01:19:03,360 --> 01:19:04,361
Hello?

1150
01:19:04,600 --> 01:19:06,762
<i>I understand we have
a new player in the game.</i>

1151
01:19:06,840 --> 01:19:08,683
<i>I don't believe we've been introduced.</i>

1152
01:19:08,960 --> 01:19:11,611
I'm a friend of Mr. Landau's.
My name is not important.

1153
01:19:11,680 --> 01:19:14,889
I'm assuming that Mr. Landau's
not dumb enough to speak to the police.

1154
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:16,001
He hasn't.

1155
01:19:16,120 --> 01:19:17,121
<i>Then who are you?</i>

1156
01:19:17,520 --> 01:19:19,602
One likes to know
who's on the other side.

1157
01:19:19,680 --> 01:19:22,411
We're on the same side.
We both want this to happen.

1158
01:19:22,480 --> 01:19:24,801
<i>Good. Then all you got to do
is follow instructions.</i>

1159
01:19:24,880 --> 01:19:26,325
No. It's not that simple.

1160
01:19:26,880 --> 01:19:29,281
Of course it is.
We tell you what to do

1161
01:19:29,360 --> 01:19:30,361
and you do it.

1162
01:19:30,480 --> 01:19:32,000
If you ever want to see the girl again.

1163
01:19:32,200 --> 01:19:34,407
You have to convince me
she's alive in the first place.

1164
01:19:34,560 --> 01:19:35,846
You have my word on that.

1165
01:19:37,680 --> 01:19:38,727
<i>That's funny.</i>

1166
01:19:38,800 --> 01:19:39,880
What, it's not good enough?

1167
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:41,889
Let's just say you lost
a lot of credibility

1168
01:19:41,960 --> 01:19:44,691
when you returned Mrs. Kristo
in poor condition.

1169
01:19:45,200 --> 01:19:47,806
There were special circumstances
regarding Mrs. Kristo.

1170
01:19:47,880 --> 01:19:49,291
Her husband tried to haggle.

1171
01:19:49,360 --> 01:19:53,160
He sliced the price, and we in turn...

1172
01:19:54,880 --> 01:19:57,161
Well, you can finish that thought
for yourself, can't you?

1173
01:19:57,200 --> 01:19:59,009
We're not going to argue the price.

1174
01:19:59,320 --> 01:20:00,446
<i>You'll pay the million?</i>

1175
01:20:00,920 --> 01:20:02,160
For the girl alive and well.

1176
01:20:02,880 --> 01:20:04,530
<i>I assure you she's both.</i>

1177
01:20:04,720 --> 01:20:06,529
Your assurance means shit to me.

1178
01:20:06,600 --> 01:20:08,568
Put her on the phone,
let her father talk to her.

1179
01:20:08,760 --> 01:20:11,969
Uh, I'm afraid I won't be able
to put her on the phone right now.

1180
01:20:12,040 --> 01:20:13,565
<i>Please deposit 25 cents...</i>

1181
01:20:13,680 --> 01:20:15,728
Out of quarters?
Give me your number, I'll call you back.

1182
01:20:29,920 --> 01:20:30,921
Yeah?

1183
01:20:31,040 --> 01:20:34,044
<i>I'm afraid the girl cannot come to the phone.
That's out of the question.</i>

1184
01:20:34,360 --> 01:20:37,443
<i>How else can we reassure you
of her wellbeing?</i>

1185
01:20:37,560 --> 01:20:38,641
Wait.

1186
01:20:39,200 --> 01:20:40,880
Tell me something your daughter would know.

1187
01:20:41,600 --> 01:20:42,601
The dog's name.

1188
01:20:43,080 --> 01:20:45,208
They could know that.
They've been following her.

1189
01:20:45,560 --> 01:20:48,200
They know your schedule.
They've probably seen her walking the dog.

1190
01:20:48,680 --> 01:20:51,650
Heard her call him by name.
Think of something else.

1191
01:20:51,840 --> 01:20:54,366
Yes. We had a dog before this one.

1192
01:20:54,440 --> 01:20:56,807
A little black-and-white one.
He got hit by a car.

1193
01:20:58,480 --> 01:21:01,643
The dog's name. And the name
of the dog before this one.

1194
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,651
<i>Have her describe both of them.
Then call me back.</i>

1195
01:21:49,640 --> 01:21:51,847
The 16 years we were married,

1196
01:21:52,720 --> 01:21:55,166
I don't remember her even having a cold.

1197
01:21:56,320 --> 01:22:00,166
Then one day she wakes up and says
she can't smell anything.

1198
01:22:03,520 --> 01:22:05,090
You were a policeman?

1199
01:22:05,160 --> 01:22:06,889
Yeah, I was.

1200
01:22:07,440 --> 01:22:09,408
You dealt with situations like this?

1201
01:22:10,600 --> 01:22:12,762
No, not like this.

1202
01:22:12,840 --> 01:22:15,810
Still, your gut must be telling you something?

1203
01:22:15,880 --> 01:22:18,451
What is it telling you now?
Is she alive?

1204
01:22:25,560 --> 01:22:26,561
Yeah?

1205
01:22:26,640 --> 01:22:29,166
<i>I'd still like to know
how you figure in all this.</i>

1206
01:22:29,840 --> 01:22:31,171
Tell me the dog's name.

1207
01:22:31,560 --> 01:22:33,210
Oh, well, let's see,

1208
01:22:34,200 --> 01:22:36,089
what are the old standbys, huh?

1209
01:22:36,560 --> 01:22:39,848
Fido? Towser? King?

1210
01:22:40,160 --> 01:22:41,969
<i>Rover, that's always a popular choice.</i>

1211
01:22:42,440 --> 01:22:46,126
<i>Hey, I know what it is.
How about Bingo?</i>

1212
01:22:47,080 --> 01:22:48,081
<i>What about Spot, huh?</i>

1213
01:22:48,600 --> 01:22:51,683
"Run, Spot, run!"
It's not a bad name for a Rottweiler.

1214
01:22:52,880 --> 01:22:54,211
<i>The dog's name is Watson.</i>

1215
01:22:54,440 --> 01:22:55,646
Watson.

1216
01:22:57,560 --> 01:22:59,369
And the other dog? The one before?

1217
01:22:59,640 --> 01:23:01,449
She couldn't tell me what breed
the other dog was.

1218
01:23:01,520 --> 01:23:03,409
She was young when it died.

1219
01:23:04,080 --> 01:23:05,809
They had it put to sleep, she said.

1220
01:23:05,880 --> 01:23:08,008
It's a silly term for it,
don't you think?

1221
01:23:09,040 --> 01:23:10,121
I mean, you're gonna kill something

1222
01:23:10,200 --> 01:23:12,640
you ought to have the courage
to say that's what you're doing.

1223
01:23:14,600 --> 01:23:16,011
<i>You're not talking. You still there?</i>

1224
01:23:16,080 --> 01:23:17,081
I'm here.

1225
01:23:17,440 --> 01:23:20,649
I gather it was a mongrel.
So many of us are.

1226
01:23:21,120 --> 01:23:24,203
Now the name's a bit of a problem.
I may not have it right.

1227
01:23:24,280 --> 01:23:27,090
It's a Russian word.
How's your Russian, my friend?

1228
01:23:27,560 --> 01:23:28,561
Tell me.

1229
01:23:30,080 --> 01:23:32,970
I may be saying this wrong. Balalaika.

1230
01:23:33,040 --> 01:23:34,040
Balalaika.

1231
01:23:35,200 --> 01:23:38,329
<i>The name of a musical instrument,
or so she tells me.</i>

1232
01:23:38,880 --> 01:23:42,123
What do you say, pal?
Does it strike a chord?

1233
01:23:46,280 --> 01:23:48,567
You got two hours to get
the money together.

1234
01:23:59,600 --> 01:24:00,601
TJ?

1235
01:24:44,640 --> 01:24:46,722
TJ? What are you doing here?

1236
01:24:46,800 --> 01:24:48,131
Handing you this.

1237
01:24:48,520 --> 01:24:51,285
I told you to give it to Peter.
Not to come down here.

1238
01:24:52,160 --> 01:24:54,208
Matthew, that dude's all spun.

1239
01:24:54,280 --> 01:24:55,920
There's no way I was gonna give it to him.

1240
01:24:56,480 --> 01:24:57,527
Later.

1241
01:25:01,080 --> 01:25:02,286
How much have we got?

1242
01:25:02,360 --> 01:25:03,441
Hang on a sec.

1243
01:25:03,560 --> 01:25:04,721
Keep it separate.

1244
01:25:06,280 --> 01:25:07,964
Holy fucking shit.

1245
01:25:09,400 --> 01:25:12,006
This is TJ, my associate.

1246
01:25:15,040 --> 01:25:17,611
Paper's good. Ink looks right.

1247
01:25:18,280 --> 01:25:20,282
Nice used bills.
This looks real enough.

1248
01:25:20,600 --> 01:25:22,090
We'll repackage them slightly.

1249
01:25:22,440 --> 01:25:23,487
We'll use the back wrappers,

1250
01:25:23,560 --> 01:25:25,369
but we'll take six bills
out of each stack

1251
01:25:25,440 --> 01:25:26,646
and replace them with real ones.

1252
01:25:26,720 --> 01:25:30,202
Three on top, three on the bottom.
What's this make the count?

1253
01:25:30,520 --> 01:25:32,727
I got at least 210 in fake stuff

1254
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:34,131
and Kenny brought another six.

1255
01:25:34,320 --> 01:25:35,685
Puts us right about eight.

1256
01:25:36,480 --> 01:25:37,766
That's good enough.

1257
01:25:40,160 --> 01:25:41,969
<i>We have to meet face-to-face.</i>

1258
01:25:42,040 --> 01:25:44,042
<i>You get an opportunity
to inspect the money,</i>

1259
01:25:44,760 --> 01:25:46,728
<i>and we get to see
that the girl is all right.</i>

1260
01:25:46,840 --> 01:25:48,410
And then you people come down on us.

1261
01:25:48,480 --> 01:25:49,970
<i>You'll have the girl covered.</i>

1262
01:25:50,400 --> 01:25:51,526
A knife at her throat.

1263
01:25:51,600 --> 01:25:52,601
If you want.

1264
01:25:52,680 --> 01:25:55,081
<i>The edge of the blade tucked up
under her windpipe.</i>

1265
01:25:55,160 --> 01:25:56,161
Whatever.

1266
01:25:56,440 --> 01:25:58,647
Yeah, I don't like this face-to-face business.

1267
01:25:58,840 --> 01:26:00,330
<i>We'll set up 50 yards apart.</i>

1268
01:26:00,880 --> 01:26:03,531
You'll be in place first.
You'll see us arrive.

1269
01:26:03,760 --> 01:26:06,411
You show the girl,
then I come over with the money.

1270
01:26:06,760 --> 01:26:08,808
- By yourself?
- <i>Yes.</i>

1271
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:10,001
Unarmed?

1272
01:26:10,080 --> 01:26:12,321
I'll have a suitcase full of money
in each hand,

1273
01:26:12,400 --> 01:26:14,323
a gun won't do me much good.

1274
01:26:14,920 --> 01:26:16,251
<i>Keep talking.</i>

1275
01:26:16,800 --> 01:26:20,771
You check the money.
When you're satisfied, you let the girl go.

1276
01:26:20,920 --> 01:26:23,002
Your man takes off with the cash.

1277
01:26:23,080 --> 01:26:25,128
You and I wait until you feel good.

1278
01:26:25,920 --> 01:26:26,921
Then we go home.

1279
01:26:27,960 --> 01:26:29,200
You could grab me.

1280
01:26:29,440 --> 01:26:33,525
You'll have that knife you keep talking about,
a gun, too, if you want one.

1281
01:26:34,200 --> 01:26:35,770
<i>You'll see my face.</i>

1282
01:26:35,840 --> 01:26:37,365
Wear a mask.

1283
01:26:37,480 --> 01:26:39,289
<i>Cuts the visibility.</i>

1284
01:26:39,960 --> 01:26:42,691
I already know what you look like, Ray.

1285
01:26:45,280 --> 01:26:46,327
What do you know?

1286
01:26:47,960 --> 01:26:49,803
I know you're a genetic fuck-up,

1287
01:26:49,880 --> 01:26:51,882
who, if I'd met on the street 10 years ago,

1288
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:53,764
I'd have thrown you out
of a fucking window.

1289
01:26:53,840 --> 01:26:55,205
<i>Careful.</i>

1290
01:26:55,280 --> 01:26:57,328
It's been a busy year
for you and your boyfriend.

1291
01:26:57,480 --> 01:26:59,209
<i>You know, I could cut
the little cunt's throat</i>

1292
01:26:59,280 --> 01:27:01,567
<i>and send her back to Daddy
a chunk at a time.</i>

1293
01:27:01,680 --> 01:27:03,648
- Then you're dead.
- <i>Oh?</i>

1294
01:27:04,040 --> 01:27:05,644
Yeah, "oh."

1295
01:27:05,880 --> 01:27:06,881
You want your money

1296
01:27:06,960 --> 01:27:08,325
or you wanna be looking behind you

1297
01:27:08,400 --> 01:27:10,209
for the rest of your worthless fucking life?

1298
01:27:11,320 --> 01:27:14,324
Do this deal and I'll sit on
what I know about you.

1299
01:27:14,680 --> 01:27:16,569
You can take your little
Bert and Ernie act

1300
01:27:16,640 --> 01:27:18,130
to the other side of the country.

1301
01:27:18,200 --> 01:27:20,009
There's plenty of dope dealers in LA.

1302
01:27:28,240 --> 01:27:29,321
Where do you want to do it?

1303
01:27:30,160 --> 01:27:31,889
How about Green-Wood Cemetery?

1304
01:27:33,160 --> 01:27:34,605
Yeah, I think I know that place.

1305
01:27:34,680 --> 01:27:37,729
<i>You should.
That's where you dumped Leila Andresen.</i>

1306
01:27:38,280 --> 01:27:40,408
There are two entrances
on the Fifth Avenue side.

1307
01:27:41,120 --> 01:27:43,202
Take the 35th Street entrance

1308
01:27:43,320 --> 01:27:45,641
and head south about 20 yards
inside the fence.

1309
01:27:45,960 --> 01:27:48,964
We'll enter at 25th
and approach you from there.

1310
01:27:49,560 --> 01:27:51,847
Say, uh, 10:30.

1311
01:27:51,920 --> 01:27:54,207
That gives you over an hour
to get there and set up.

1312
01:27:54,360 --> 01:27:57,204
Leila. Was that her name?

1313
01:27:57,520 --> 01:27:59,045
I would think you'd remember.

1314
01:27:59,160 --> 01:28:01,640
No, once they're in the van,
they're just body parts.

1315
01:28:02,800 --> 01:28:04,006
10:30.

1316
01:28:04,080 --> 01:28:06,208
<i>Oh, God, she was so scared...</i>

1317
01:28:08,560 --> 01:28:10,244
Have you got a rifle?

1318
01:28:10,520 --> 01:28:11,521
Dani.

1319
01:28:11,720 --> 01:28:12,721
Is he a good shot?

1320
01:28:13,120 --> 01:28:16,090
During the day maybe.
Dani's a little nearsighted.

1321
01:28:16,160 --> 01:28:17,730
Peter was in the army.

1322
01:28:21,560 --> 01:28:23,483
Yeah, it was a while ago. Yeah.

1323
01:28:24,680 --> 01:28:28,571
Give him the rifle. Keep Dani
and the other one here with your wife.

1324
01:28:29,280 --> 01:28:30,884
I don't want to spook our friends.

1325
01:28:55,280 --> 01:28:57,408
<i>Who would like to read the 12 steps?</i>

1326
01:29:04,680 --> 01:29:06,967
Hi, I'm Sarah and I'm an alcoholic.

1327
01:29:07,040 --> 01:29:08,405
Hi, Sarah.

1328
01:29:09,840 --> 01:29:11,171
Step one.

1329
01:29:12,040 --> 01:29:14,771
<i>We admitted we were powerless over alcohol.</i>

1330
01:29:15,440 --> 01:29:17,363
<i>That our lives had become unmanageable.</i>

1331
01:29:56,760 --> 01:29:57,807
What's the drill?

1332
01:29:57,920 --> 01:29:59,331
Stay in the car. Lock the doors.

1333
01:29:59,400 --> 01:30:01,243
Call 911 if anything goes down.

1334
01:30:01,320 --> 01:30:02,321
This is such bull...

1335
01:30:06,480 --> 01:30:07,481
<i>Step two.</i>

1336
01:30:09,480 --> 01:30:11,369
<i>Came to believe that a power greater</i>

1337
01:30:11,440 --> 01:30:13,966
<i>than ourselves could restore us to sanity.</i>

1338
01:30:48,200 --> 01:30:49,611
That's far enough.

1339
01:30:49,680 --> 01:30:52,206
Come out where I can see you.
Show the girl.

1340
01:30:52,320 --> 01:30:54,209
I have a knife to her throat.

1341
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:56,240
If my hand slips...

1342
01:30:56,320 --> 01:30:57,731
Let's hope it doesn't.

1343
01:30:58,480 --> 01:30:59,720
Is that our money?

1344
01:31:05,560 --> 01:31:06,891
<i>Step three.</i>

1345
01:31:07,200 --> 01:31:09,726
<i>Made a decision to turn
our will and our lives</i>

1346
01:31:09,800 --> 01:31:12,406
<i>over to the care of God
as we understood him.</i>

1347
01:31:16,120 --> 01:31:17,451
Now, let her go.

1348
01:31:17,520 --> 01:31:19,329
We ought to just shoot this cocksucker.

1349
01:31:19,560 --> 01:31:21,050
Don't change the rules now, Ray.

1350
01:31:27,720 --> 01:31:28,721
Let her go.

1351
01:31:31,240 --> 01:31:32,651
Sweet Lucy.

1352
01:31:34,240 --> 01:31:35,571
I hate to see you go.

1353
01:31:39,760 --> 01:31:43,207
Lucia, walk toward me.
Your father's just over here, Lucia.

1354
01:31:49,600 --> 01:31:50,761
<i>Step four.</i>

1355
01:31:51,560 --> 01:31:52,971
What's the matter with her hand?

1356
01:31:53,040 --> 01:31:54,690
Nothing. She's right as rain.

1357
01:31:54,760 --> 01:31:58,082
<i>Made a searching and fearless
moral inventory of ourselves.</i>

1358
01:32:04,760 --> 01:32:06,285
It was before you set the terms.

1359
01:32:09,440 --> 01:32:12,887
Go to your dad. Go to your dad, baby.
Atta girl.

1360
01:32:19,520 --> 01:32:21,284
Go on, get out of here.

1361
01:32:25,360 --> 01:32:27,362
I liked her. She was nice.

1362
01:32:33,280 --> 01:32:35,328
What the fuck is the matter with you, man?

1363
01:32:35,720 --> 01:32:37,290
Why aren't you afraid?

1364
01:32:37,960 --> 01:32:39,121
I don't know.

1365
01:32:40,640 --> 01:32:42,961
Maybe I don't care
if you shoot me or not.

1366
01:32:43,760 --> 01:32:46,969
Or maybe there's a high-powered rifle
pointed at your head.

1367
01:32:55,080 --> 01:32:56,127
I could still kill you.

1368
01:32:56,200 --> 01:32:57,247
I'm right here.

1369
01:32:58,760 --> 01:33:00,569
In some ways,
you'll be doing me a big favor.

1370
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:04,685
No. I think I'll just fade into the shadows.

1371
01:33:06,600 --> 01:33:07,601
They fucked us.

1372
01:33:07,840 --> 01:33:08,841
<i>Shoot him.</i>

1373
01:33:10,760 --> 01:33:11,807
<i>Step five.</i>

1374
01:33:11,920 --> 01:33:14,321
<i>Admitted to God, to ourselves,</i>

1375
01:33:14,680 --> 01:33:18,401
and to another human being
the exact nature of our wrongs.

1376
01:33:31,520 --> 01:33:32,806
<i>Step six.</i>

1377
01:33:33,120 --> 01:33:35,043
<i>We are entirely ready to have God</i>

1378
01:33:35,120 --> 01:33:37,361
<i>remove all these defects of character.</i>

1379
01:33:39,520 --> 01:33:40,681
Peter!

1380
01:33:50,280 --> 01:33:51,725
<i>Step seven.</i>

1381
01:33:52,480 --> 01:33:55,324
<i>Humbly ask Him to remove our shortcomings.</i>

1382
01:34:03,120 --> 01:34:04,406
<i>Step eight.</i>

1383
01:34:04,520 --> 01:34:06,409
<i>Made a list of all persons we had harmed</i>

1384
01:34:06,840 --> 01:34:09,411
<i>and became willing
to make amends to them all.</i>

1385
01:34:27,760 --> 01:34:28,841
Don't move.

1386
01:34:29,200 --> 01:34:30,884
Kenny, I got to tell you...

1387
01:34:31,400 --> 01:34:32,447
It's okay.

1388
01:34:32,720 --> 01:34:33,926
You gotta know.

1389
01:34:35,760 --> 01:34:36,841
I loved...

1390
01:34:36,920 --> 01:34:38,081
<i>Step nine.</i>

1391
01:34:39,360 --> 01:34:41,442
<i>Make direct amends to such people.</i>

1392
01:34:42,600 --> 01:34:43,601
I loved...

1393
01:34:44,920 --> 01:34:46,251
I love you, too, man.

1394
01:34:51,600 --> 01:34:54,888
<i>...except when to do so
would injure them or others.</i>

1395
01:34:59,960 --> 01:35:01,121
Which way did they go?

1396
01:35:07,240 --> 01:35:08,526
He shot me!

1397
01:35:14,360 --> 01:35:15,486
TJ?

1398
01:35:15,640 --> 01:35:16,641
Oh, Christ.

1399
01:35:17,680 --> 01:35:19,880
He must have panicked
when he heard the shooting.

1400
01:35:20,120 --> 01:35:22,566
He can't be out in this rain.
We have to find him.

1401
01:35:23,120 --> 01:35:24,485
Well, he's got a phone, right?

1402
01:35:53,200 --> 01:35:54,201
Help!

1403
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:56,001
Albert!

1404
01:36:12,360 --> 01:36:13,400
Shit!

1405
01:36:16,840 --> 01:36:17,841
Hello?

1406
01:36:19,360 --> 01:36:20,361
Oh, fuck.

1407
01:36:21,880 --> 01:36:22,881
TJ.

1408
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:25,128
<i>Scudder. I got in the van.
They don't know I'm here.</i>

1409
01:36:25,200 --> 01:36:27,487
Listen to me. Get out of there. Now.

1410
01:36:27,680 --> 01:36:29,284
It's cool. I'm in the garage
and they in the house.

1411
01:36:29,360 --> 01:36:30,361
Which is where?

1412
01:36:30,520 --> 01:36:31,726
Sit down.

1413
01:36:33,720 --> 01:36:35,609
I've never been shot before.

1414
01:36:36,600 --> 01:36:38,762
There's a first aid kit in the bathroom.

1415
01:37:14,400 --> 01:37:15,845
Hey, I don't see any numbers.

1416
01:37:15,920 --> 01:37:17,046
<i>Try next door.</i>

1417
01:37:18,800 --> 01:37:21,121
697. Wait, no. 692.

1418
01:37:21,360 --> 01:37:23,089
<i>Okay, now walk away from the house.</i>

1419
01:37:23,800 --> 01:37:24,881
<i>Go to the corner.</i>

1420
01:37:26,800 --> 01:37:28,643
- Is any of it real?
- Some.

1421
01:37:41,600 --> 01:37:43,170
51st Street and Church Avenue.

1422
01:37:43,760 --> 01:37:45,125
Borough Park.

1423
01:37:45,200 --> 01:37:46,480
That's not even a mile from here.

1424
01:37:47,440 --> 01:37:48,805
<i>Stay put. You hear me?</i>

1425
01:37:49,120 --> 01:37:50,121
Pigs.

1426
01:38:04,080 --> 01:38:05,127
Hey, who's...

1427
01:38:09,680 --> 01:38:11,364
Shit, shit, shit.

1428
01:39:47,720 --> 01:39:49,802
You can have your money back.

1429
01:39:49,920 --> 01:39:51,046
It's downstairs.

1430
01:39:56,200 --> 01:39:57,565
Don't even think about it.

1431
01:40:19,560 --> 01:40:20,607
You're the husband.

1432
01:40:21,400 --> 01:40:22,401
So?

1433
01:40:22,720 --> 01:40:23,720
I was just wondering.

1434
01:40:23,760 --> 01:40:25,480
Were you just going
to leave Ray down there?

1435
01:40:25,600 --> 01:40:26,601
No.

1436
01:40:27,520 --> 01:40:29,841
I was going to get something to eat.

1437
01:40:29,960 --> 01:40:31,849
I was going to clean up before I left.

1438
01:40:32,120 --> 01:40:34,168
What were you going to do with him?

1439
01:40:34,240 --> 01:40:35,401
Chop him up.

1440
01:40:36,160 --> 01:40:39,004
Wrap him. There are plenty of bags
in the cupboard.

1441
01:40:39,080 --> 01:40:41,845
And then what? Deliver him to somebody
in the trunk of a car?

1442
01:40:41,960 --> 01:40:42,961
No.

1443
01:40:44,120 --> 01:40:45,451
That was just for you.

1444
01:40:47,640 --> 01:40:49,483
You have a choice to make, Kenny.

1445
01:40:50,240 --> 01:40:53,005
There's a lot of hard evidence
against this asshole.

1446
01:40:53,080 --> 01:40:55,287
He's got his dead buddy in the basement.

1447
01:40:55,800 --> 01:40:57,768
Not to mention the van in the garage.

1448
01:40:57,840 --> 01:41:01,526
It's gonna be full of fibers and blood traces
and God knows what else.

1449
01:41:02,800 --> 01:41:04,802
He ought to be looking
at three life sentences,

1450
01:41:05,160 --> 01:41:08,642
plus an extra 20 or 30 years
tacked on as a bonus.

1451
01:41:09,320 --> 01:41:11,482
What about the other choice?

1452
01:41:12,040 --> 01:41:13,041
You with me?

1453
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:18,001
No.

1454
01:41:19,600 --> 01:41:21,523
I could turn him in and sleep just fine.

1455
01:41:21,640 --> 01:41:23,404
I don't think I could.

1456
01:41:23,480 --> 01:41:25,448
That's why it has to be your decision.

1457
01:41:28,160 --> 01:41:30,003
Well, I guess I just made it.

1458
01:41:32,680 --> 01:41:34,011
Take it easy, Matt.

1459
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:44,001
Come on.

1460
01:41:52,400 --> 01:41:54,971
You know I could help you with that hand.

1461
01:41:57,560 --> 01:41:58,561
Could you?

1462
01:43:08,560 --> 01:43:11,643
Shelter's gonna be closed.
Wait for me back at my place.

1463
01:43:11,920 --> 01:43:13,126
Where are you going?

1464
01:43:13,200 --> 01:43:14,281
Just do as I say.

1465
01:43:25,400 --> 01:43:29,246
<i>Step 10. Continue to take
personal inventory.</i>

1466
01:43:29,360 --> 01:43:32,125
<i>And when we were wrong,
promptly admitted it.</i>

1467
01:43:33,120 --> 01:43:34,121
<i>Step 11.</i>

1468
01:43:34,800 --> 01:43:36,802
<i>Sought through prayer and meditation</i>

1469
01:43:37,320 --> 01:43:41,006
<i>to improve our conscious contact with God
as we understand him.</i>

1470
01:43:41,160 --> 01:43:43,322
<i>Praying only for the knowledge of his will</i>

1471
01:43:43,400 --> 01:43:45,971
<i>for us and the power
to carry that out.</i>

1472
01:43:47,640 --> 01:43:52,521
<i>Step 12. Having had a spiritual awakening
as the result of these steps,</i>

1473
01:43:53,160 --> 01:43:55,891
<i>we try to carry this message to alcoholics</i>

1474
01:43:56,160 --> 01:43:59,642
<i>and to practice these principles
in all our affairs.</i>

1475
01:44:32,960 --> 01:44:34,166
Kenny?

1476
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:41,001
You know,

1477
01:47:43,080 --> 01:47:44,366
I just wanted to...

(MELLOW SONG PLAYING)

2
00:00:51,384 --> 00:00:57,347
The evening fell just like a star
Left a trail behind

3
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:01,226
You spit as you slammed out the door

4
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:09,318
If this is love we're crazy
We fight like cats and dogs

5
00:01:10,653 --> 00:01:14,114
But I just know there's got to be more

6
00:01:19,496 --> 00:01:25,667
Please call me, baby
Wherever you are

7
00:01:26,169 --> 00:01:29,088
It's too cold to be out
walking in the streets

8
00:01:31,716 --> 00:01:34,802
We do crazy things
when we're wounded

9
00:01:34,844 --> 00:01:38,222
Everyone's a bit insane

10
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:44,394
I don't want you catching
your death of cold

11
00:01:44,687 --> 00:01:47,481
Out walking in the rain

12
00:02:04,499 --> 00:02:10,212
I admit that I ain't no angel
I admit that I ain't no saint

13
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:14,716
I'm selfish and I'm cruel
But you're blind

14
00:02:17,095 --> 00:02:22,724
If I exorcise my devils
Well, my angels may leave too

15
00:02:23,852 --> 00:02:27,729
When they leave they're so hard to find

16
00:02:32,735 --> 00:02:38,740
Please call me, baby
Wherever you are

17
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:42,536
It's too cold to be out
walking in the streets

18
00:02:44,789 --> 00:02:47,958
We do crazy things
when we're wounded

19
00:02:48,042 --> 00:02:50,836
Everyone's a bit insane

20
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:57,426
I don't want you catching
your death of cold

21
00:02:57,468 --> 00:03:00,137
Out walking in the rain

22
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:11,607
- (MUSIC PLAYING QUIETLY)
- Answer me honestly.

23
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:17,821
If I was to tell you that I love you
and that I'd throw it all away

24
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:21,491
to be with you, what would you say?

25
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:23,827
Goodnight, Paulie.

26
00:03:27,999 --> 00:03:32,878
Yup. Yup, that's about par
for the evening.

27
00:03:33,129 --> 00:03:39,885
But what I wanna see
Is the way things used to be

28
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:48,018
Between you and me
The way things used to be...

29
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:49,937
(SOBBING)

30
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:54,775
Let me guess.

31
00:03:54,859 --> 00:03:58,654
Your old lady got fed up
'cause you're chasing skirt,

32
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:01,907
so she took these little ones
and left you.

33
00:04:01,991 --> 00:04:05,953
It's a little more complicated than that.

34
00:04:06,037 --> 00:04:09,456
It always is. Everybody thinks
their story has a twist.

35
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:11,166
But in my experience...

36
00:04:12,877 --> 00:04:15,170
- Holy shit.
- Exactly.

37
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:17,547
This I've got to hear.

38
00:04:17,715 --> 00:04:21,260
It's a long story,
and I know you're very busy...

39
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:26,056
- I don't really feel like...
- Wait, wait. No, no, please.

40
00:04:34,857 --> 00:04:40,862
Okay, now tell me, Father, how long
has it been since your last drink?

41
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:45,826
It's been about a minute
and a half since my last drink.

42
00:04:46,202 --> 00:04:49,997
Now, what about these kids?

43
00:04:50,164 --> 00:04:55,794
Okay. Well, you see the one
on the right?

44
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:59,214
The cute one? That's me.

45
00:05:02,093 --> 00:05:04,052
- Very cute.
- Brian Finn.

46
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:05,929
Paulie Chopra.

47
00:05:07,932 --> 00:05:10,851
This kid on the left
was my best friend, Jake.

48
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:17,274
- He's a priest, too?
- Jake? No. In fact, he's a rabbi.

49
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:21,611
C'mon. A priest and a rabbi?
I've heard this one.

50
00:05:21,696 --> 00:05:26,158
I've heard all of those. Trust me,
you have not heard this one.

51
00:05:26,242 --> 00:05:31,913
Okay? So there's this priest
and this rabbi, and they're best friends.

52
00:05:32,123 --> 00:05:35,876
But before they were a priest
and a rabbi,

53
00:05:36,085 --> 00:05:37,252
they both knew this girl.

54
00:05:38,963 --> 00:05:41,214
PAULIE: The girl.

55
00:05:41,549 --> 00:05:44,092
- Who's the girl?
- That's Anna Reilly.

56
00:05:44,135 --> 00:05:48,263
Reilly? Let me guess,
she became a nun?

57
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:50,057
Not quite. Not quite...

58
00:05:52,143 --> 00:05:56,104
We all met in 6th grade at PS 84,
right here in Manhattan.

59
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:03,612
I think I already knew Jake,
then we both met Anna.

60
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:07,449
Actually, I remember exactly
how we met, 'cause...

61
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:10,118
Well, it was a defining moment.

62
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:16,458
After that,
we were pretty much inseparable.

63
00:06:24,133 --> 00:06:27,427
Jake and I were
what you'd call "late bloomers,"

64
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:32,099
and a 7th grade girl's attentions
can be fickle, but not Anna.

65
00:06:32,141 --> 00:06:34,267
Her loyalty to us was constant.

66
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:37,646
Anna was the friend
every 13-year-old boy dreams of.

67
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:40,774
That magical cross
between Jonny Quest

68
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:43,402
and Tatum O'Neal in Foxes.

69
00:06:57,834 --> 00:07:01,837
We were some trio. Anna called us
"Two Micks and a Yid."

70
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:03,463
She was gonna make T-shirts.

71
00:07:04,632 --> 00:07:08,427
There's 8 million people in New York,
but when we were together,

72
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:10,720
it felt like we lived on our own island.

73
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:15,016
But New York is an island.

74
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:19,938
I'm trying to sprinkle a little
fairy dust here, to tell a story!

75
00:07:20,022 --> 00:07:24,776
I'm terribly sorry. Continue.
Go on, sprinkle away.

76
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:28,447
Well, then disaster struck.

77
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:31,992
The summer after 8th grade,
Anna's father got a job in California,

78
00:07:32,034 --> 00:07:34,995
and just like that, she was gone.

79
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:46,590
As for me and Jake,
our friendship just got stronger.

80
00:07:47,049 --> 00:07:49,176
We were like most kids in New York,

81
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:52,929
but there was one unusual component:

82
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:55,724
We were fascinated
with each other's religions.

83
00:07:55,766 --> 00:07:58,435
He showed me
the secret rituals of Judaism,

84
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:01,730
and I revealed
the Catholic mysteries.

85
00:08:01,772 --> 00:08:06,568
Just remember:
Spectacles, testicles, watch, wallet.

86
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:20,582
What makes two kids want to be
a priest and a rabbi nowadays?

87
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:23,668
People don't talk much
about a calling anymore,

88
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:25,962
but I knew it was what
I was supposed to do.

89
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:29,299
Even then, people felt good
bringing their problems to me.

90
00:08:30,968 --> 00:08:33,929
My parents had given up
on children before me,

91
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:36,389
so my mother called me
her "gift from God."

92
00:08:36,724 --> 00:08:41,353
That stuck with me, so at eight
I told her I felt I had to return the favor.

93
00:08:41,604 --> 00:08:43,438
She was so happy, she cried.

94
00:08:43,481 --> 00:08:46,441
My dad just wanted to know
if working for God came with dental.

95
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:52,280
Jake's sense of a calling
didn't gel as early as mine.

96
00:08:53,491 --> 00:08:56,451
Religion was more of a hobby for him.

97
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:58,286
Got it, got it,

98
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:04,292
need it, need it,
got it, got it, need it, got it.

99
00:09:04,752 --> 00:09:07,504
(CHEERING AND SHOUTING)

100
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:11,883
Jake was one of those special kids.
Smart, popular.

101
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:14,886
Everything came easy to him.
He had an aura.

102
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:20,183
You took one look at him, and you
knew he could do anything in life.

103
00:09:20,601 --> 00:09:24,479
Jake's family had been in investment
banking for three generations.

104
00:09:24,522 --> 00:09:28,483
His father and brother Ethan
wanted him to join the family firm.

105
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:31,361
I think he considered it,

106
00:09:31,445 --> 00:09:34,739
but he wanted to do
something different with his life.

107
00:09:35,157 --> 00:09:39,160
He made his decision to become
a rabbi with confidence and resolve.

108
00:09:39,203 --> 00:09:41,079
I don't wanna listen to you!

109
00:09:41,372 --> 00:09:45,166
We went off to seminary the way
other guys go off to the Peace Corps.

110
00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:46,543
It was an adventure.

111
00:09:49,171 --> 00:09:53,717
Newly ordained, we were both
assigned back to New York City,

112
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:56,386
where we quickly confronted
the practical aspects of our jobs.

113
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:02,225

118
00:10:34,842 --> 00:10:38,011
Despite these setbacks,
we found our groove.

119
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:42,057
Take it nice and easy.
Win them over slowly, okay?

120
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:45,143
Shabbat shalom, everyone!

121
00:10:45,394 --> 00:10:47,395
I want you to do me a favor.

122
00:10:47,563 --> 00:10:51,358
I want everybody in the back
to come and fill up the front rows.

123
00:10:52,234 --> 00:10:56,112
Guys, come on! Let's try again.
Shabbat shalom!

124
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:59,074
- Shabbat shalom!
- Thank you, Mom.

125
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:03,912
Ma'am, you in the back, come on!
God hates a solo artist, I promise you.

126
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,498
We're the Fugees, no Lauryn Hills.

127
00:11:06,707 --> 00:11:13,421
My mom was the only person here
at the level of shabbat shalom-iness

128
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:15,465
that I think we can hit.

129
00:11:15,549 --> 00:11:20,387
Sir, you're leaving. It's customary
to sneak out after the communion.

130
00:11:20,429 --> 00:11:23,139
Give me something I can work with!
Shabbat shalom!

131
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:26,935
- ALL: Shabbat shalom!
- All right! Now we can daven!

132
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:31,564
BRIAN: I don 't want to brag, but word
got out there was a new act in town,

133
00:11:31,607 --> 00:11:36,403
and soon we played to the packed
houses I knew were our destiny.

134
00:11:36,445 --> 00:11:38,446
(LAUGHTER)

135
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:41,324
I know. I know!

136
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:49,165
Seriously, what is the story of Sodom
and Gomorrah really about?

137
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:52,585
- Anyone? Steve Posner.
- Sexual perversion.

138
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:57,090
Sexual perversion. Steve Posner's
watching too much Spice Channel.

139
00:11:57,341 --> 00:12:02,554
The Seven Deadly Sins. Who can
name the Seven Deadly Sins?

140
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:09,644
People! It was a film with Brad Pitt.
You have the ultimate Cliff Note!

141
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:14,691
And Lot takes them in and he protects
them. What happens next?

142
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:18,236
Anybody? Greta Mussbaum,
before she pulls her rotator cuff.

143
00:12:19,697 --> 00:12:24,325
- God spares Lot and his family.
- Bingo! Two-week cruise for Greta!

144
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:27,454
You're going to the Bahamas!

145
00:12:27,788 --> 00:12:32,083
When you think about it,
God is a lot like Blanche Du Bois.

146
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:34,544
He's always relied
on the kindness of strangers.

147
00:12:34,628 --> 00:12:35,670
(INAUDIBLE)

148
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:38,631
That's what the story's about,
us taking care of each other.

149
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:41,801
God relies on us
to take care of each other.

150
00:12:41,844 --> 00:12:46,556
The truth is, I don't really learn about
your faith by asking such questions.

151
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:50,518
Those aren't questions about faith,
they're about religion.

152
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:54,397
It's important to understand
the difference between them,

153
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:57,484
because faith is not about
having the right answers.

154
00:12:58,194 --> 00:13:02,030
Faith is a feeling, faith is a hunch.

155
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:06,659
It's a hunch that there is
something bigger, connecting it all.

156
00:13:06,702 --> 00:13:09,037
Connecting us all together.

157
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:13,666
And that feeling, that hunch, is God.

158
00:13:15,377 --> 00:13:20,840
Coming here on Sunday evening
to connect with that feeling,

159
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:23,843
that is an act of faith.

160
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:28,139
So all I have to do is look around
the room, at this packed church,

161
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:32,393
to know that we're doing pretty well
as a community.

162
00:13:34,563 --> 00:13:37,106
Even if all of you failed
my pop quiz miserably.

163
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:41,236
Let us pray.

164
00:13:43,405 --> 00:13:46,991
Jake and I wanted
to kick the dust off our faiths.

165
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:50,703
Bring them up to speed,
no more old routines.

166
00:13:50,746 --> 00:13:53,957
Jake said, "We'll give them an
Old World God with a New Age spin."

(CHANTING)

168
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,045
Feel the prana!

169
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:01,464
We decided to turn
an abandoned disco

170
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:05,969
into a joint Catholic-Jewish
senior center/karaoke lounge.

171
00:14:06,053 --> 00:14:09,264
A Fiddler on the Roof meets
Lord of the Dance

172
00:14:09,306 --> 00:14:12,100
meets Buena Vista Social Club.

173
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:17,021
Not an easy idea to sell,
but we wanted to push the envelope.

174
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:20,650
We would bring our religions
into the 21 st century.

175
00:14:20,734 --> 00:14:22,986
We were gonna shove them a little,
if we had to.

176
00:14:24,321 --> 00:14:28,283
Jake said we'd be like young cops
shaking up the force.

177
00:14:28,325 --> 00:14:30,326
You know. The God Squad.

178
00:14:31,495 --> 00:14:33,538
(UP-TEMPO SONG PLAYING)

179
00:14:39,336 --> 00:14:43,381
Well, it's just like the ocean
under the moon

180
00:14:43,465 --> 00:14:47,802
Well, that's the same as the emotion
that I get from you

181
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:52,181
You got the kind of loving
that can be so smooth, yeah

182
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:56,269
Give me your heart, make it real
Or else forget about it

183
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:06,321
I'll ring it.

184
00:15:07,197 --> 00:15:08,656
Nice.

185
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:09,908
Oh!

186
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:12,994
Ben Lewis comes into my office
this morning, tells me he's retiring.

187
00:15:13,704 --> 00:15:15,622
- Rabbi Lewis?
- Yeah.

188
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:19,918
- The end of an era.
- I know!

189
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:22,545
That's exciting. How long until
they give it over to you officially?

190
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:28,968
There are a few backward thinkers
on that board who don't get what I do.

191
00:15:29,511 --> 00:15:31,471
Plus, there's the fact that I'm single.

192
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:37,518
- Single?
- Don't think that's not an issue.

193
00:15:37,853 --> 00:15:40,605
Wait a minute. Are you serious?

194
00:15:40,689 --> 00:15:44,943
If you don't find a nice Jewish girl soon,
you won't get the job?

195
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:49,238
I'm telling you, B'Nai Ezra
hasn't had a bachelor head rabbi

196
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:52,241
since the beginning of the synagogue.

197
00:15:52,534 --> 00:15:55,620
Wow. I mean, you better start
getting out there more.

198
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:59,165
It's embarrassing.

199
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:02,168
Forget that.
You want to meet somebody, right?

200
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:07,215
I just want to meet somebody
in a spontaneous and casual manner.

201
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:10,051
- And it's impossible with me.
- Why?

202
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:14,389
- Because I'm a rabbi!
- Yes, yes. What's your point?

203
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:17,558
I don't know if a woman
goes out with me for me,

204
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:20,979
or because I'm Rabbi Jake, you know?

205
00:16:21,188 --> 00:16:24,691
There's an expectation,
I can't go with my impulses...

206
00:16:25,025 --> 00:16:28,653
Jews want rabbis to be the kind of
Jews they don't have the time to be.

207
00:16:29,071 --> 00:16:32,865
And Catholics want priests
to have the discipline they don't have.

208
00:16:33,575 --> 00:16:35,410
- We knew this.
- You're right.

209
00:16:35,869 --> 00:16:39,747
Oh, no, man, check this out.
God Squad in the house!

210
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:43,376
- Hi, Shabazz.
- You gonna give it up, Rabbi?

211
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:47,046
Say your prayers,
because I am in no mood today.

212
00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:48,923
Watch your ass, Shabazz!

Power to the people y'all
Turn me loose

Oh!

218
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:12,238
- Bye. See you guys.
- Tell your mother I said hi.

219
00:17:20,581 --> 00:17:25,793
I've gotta quit playing the guys from
Jewish seminary, it lowers the bar.

220
00:17:27,254 --> 00:17:31,507
- Can I just say oy?
- Amen to your oy.

221
00:17:32,509 --> 00:17:36,262
- What happened to our youth?
- It ended at 30.

222
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:39,515
Speaking of our youth,
I forgot to tell you.

223
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,518
- This is big. Guess who called me?
- Who?

224
00:17:43,103 --> 00:17:47,231
Who is the coolest woman
you and I have ever known, ever?

225
00:17:49,526 --> 00:17:53,321
- That's easy. Anna Reilly, 8th grade.
- You got it.

226
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:55,865
- What? She called you?
- Yeah!

227
00:17:55,949 --> 00:17:57,950
- Anna Reilly called you?
- Totally out of the blue.

228
00:17:57,993 --> 00:17:58,993
Why?

229
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:03,498
She's coming to New York for work,
and she wants to get together.

230
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:06,542
Really? What is she doing now?

231
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:11,422
She's analyzing synergies
or synergizing analogies.

232
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:16,135
I couldn't follow it,
she's a very high-powered business...

233
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:18,262
- Woman?
- Yes, thank you.

234
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:21,891
- Wow. You told her about us?
- Yeah, she flipped.

235
00:18:21,975 --> 00:18:24,685
She laughed for ten minutes,
but she was excited.

236
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:28,356
- Man, that is so cool!
- I know.

237
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:33,444
- I wonder why she called you?
- What do you mean?

238
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:36,572
No, I mean, she called you.

239
00:18:38,033 --> 00:18:41,369
- Are you in the 8th grade still?
- It's a legitimate question.

240
00:18:41,411 --> 00:18:45,456
- I mean, we're both listed.
- Finn before Schram, okay?

241
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:50,294
- You're ridiculous.
- That's a good point. Alphabetical.

242

- Let's toss this, we look like idiots.
- Shut up, we do not!

243
00:19:03,183 --> 00:19:04,267
You shut up.

244
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:05,768
Think she's changed?

245
00:19:06,353 --> 00:19:10,231
No, I bet she still weighs 88 pounds
and listens to Leif Garrett.

246
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:14,152
For the record, it's Leif, long A.
Didn't you see Behind the Music?

- Whoa.
- Jake Schram. How are you?

- All right. Job is good. Really good.

and retired, and I take yoga.

- Men?
- That's my life.

261
00:20:10,792 --> 00:20:15,546
- Come on, don't cheat us.
- I don't have time for relationships.

- Yeah, working for the...

- That's a full-time thing.
- No, I work harder than God.

the world by Thursday.

- No, for you guys, I will make time.

- That's my bag.

- I got it.

- I got it. Give it to me.

- Yep, no, go.

of the kids from school?

- BRIAN: He always complained.

- ANNA: Remember our shoplifting club?
- You had to steal to be a member.

You stuck that basketball under
your shirt and said you were pregnant.

278

- I pulled it off.
- You were 12.

279
00:21:29,162 --> 00:21:32,915
It was New York in the '80s,
you could get away with anything.

280
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:35,418
- We should get home.
- Yeah, it's late.

281
00:21:35,502 --> 00:21:39,672
I'm still on West Coast time.
It's 8:00 for me. Let's do something.

282
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:48,431
So, this is a rectory.
Sounds like a dirty word. Rectory.

283
00:21:48,515 --> 00:21:50,224
- Great place to meet chicks.
- Totally.

284
00:21:51,018 --> 00:21:53,519
I'll bet. So, what's your chick situation?

285
00:21:53,562 --> 00:21:54,895
Oh, um...

286
00:21:54,938 --> 00:21:58,149
- Don't ask, it's not a good story.
- Why?

00:21:58,358 --> 00:22:02,320
His congregation wants to set him up,
it makes him uncomfortable.

288
00:22:02,404 --> 00:22:05,698
- Why?
- Pandas don't mate in captivity.

289
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:08,326
What does that mean?

290
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:11,203
All these mothers make dates
for me that I can't refuse.

291
00:22:11,246 --> 00:22:13,748
They're intimidating.
They're like the Kosher Nostra.

292
00:22:13,915 --> 00:22:15,082
Oh!

293
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:17,752
It's true. They're little women,
but very determined.

294
00:22:17,794 --> 00:22:19,920
You're being melodramatic.

295
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:24,925
Oh, yeah? Check this out. I was faxed
one of their daughter's résumés.

296
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:28,554
- Let me see that. Ali Decker.
- Look at the bottom.

297
00:22:29,222 --> 00:22:31,849
- Oh, she has a skills section.
- Yes?

298
00:22:32,684 --> 00:22:34,643
You win. She put jogging as a skill.

299
00:22:34,728 --> 00:22:37,646
She can't even differentiate
between a hobby and a skill.

300
00:22:37,731 --> 00:22:40,900
- Maybe she's a skilled jogger.
- I have to date this girl!

301
00:22:40,942 --> 00:22:43,611
- Why don't I say no?
- Why don't you?

302
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:47,198
I can't alienate them,
I need body count at the temple.

303
00:22:47,282 --> 00:22:49,575
Just relax. It'll be fine.

304
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:54,789
Oh, God, please let this be painless.

305
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:56,749
- Hi!
- Hi!

306
00:22:56,792 --> 00:22:59,585
Right on time. I like that in a rabbi.

307
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:05,800
- Hey, this is a great place.
- My lair.

308
00:23:05,842 --> 00:23:08,302
- Really nice.
- Be ready in a second.

309
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:12,431
- A lot of space.
- I know. "Thanks, Daddy," right?

310
00:23:14,643 --> 00:23:16,060
You go, girl!

311
00:23:18,814 --> 00:23:21,315
No pain, no gain!

312
00:23:22,484 --> 00:23:26,320
Oh, Tuesdays with Morrie.
I love that book.

313
00:23:36,331 --> 00:23:38,207
I'm ready.

314
00:23:39,501 --> 00:23:41,877
- You do these tapes?
- Are you kidding me?

315
00:23:41,962 --> 00:23:44,213
- No.
- Are you kidding me?

316
00:23:44,339 --> 00:23:47,925
- No.
- Exercise is like a religion to me.

317
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:51,137
No pun intended. Feel my abs!

318
00:23:52,013 --> 00:23:54,223
- Not bad, right?
- Ouch!

319
00:23:54,516 --> 00:23:56,225
- Punch me.
- Excuse me?

320
00:23:56,309 --> 00:23:59,395
- You heard me.
- I'm not gonna punch you.

321
00:23:59,855 --> 00:24:03,274
You'll find, Rabbi,
that this princess is no pushover.

322
00:24:03,358 --> 00:24:06,193
I can tell. Call me Jake, all right?

323
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:10,114
Okay, let's get a few things
straight here, Jake.

324
00:24:10,532 --> 00:24:16,078
One, I like you a lot, and unless
I'm wrong, I think you like me.

325
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:20,291
- Well, we just met...
- Two, I am many things.

326
00:24:21,001 --> 00:24:24,628
No one thing defines me.

how much we love Him, or Her.

if they feel they're being led
and not pushed!

486
00:36:36,777 --> 00:36:39,779
RUTH: Good for you, Anna.

487
00:36:40,323 --> 00:36:42,741
No more of this
"woman behind the man" shit.

488
00:36:42,783 --> 00:36:46,119
Most men are unworthy
of the opportunities they've had.

489
00:36:46,287 --> 00:36:49,080
As a woman on your own,
trying to succeed,

490
00:36:49,123 --> 00:36:52,834
what do you do
with that victory energy each day?

491
00:36:52,919 --> 00:36:55,045
Don't you want to share it?

492
00:36:55,129 --> 00:36:58,465
Do what they do. Take lovers.
I've had more dates than Jake.

493
00:36:58,549 --> 00:36:59,633
Mom...

494
00:36:59,675 --> 00:37:04,679
It's true. And when lovers bore,
which they will, sublimate.

495
00:37:04,764 --> 00:37:08,850
- I take classes.
- Me, too! What's your favorite?

496
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:11,353
- Kabbalah. You?
- Kick-boxing.

497
00:37:11,437 --> 00:37:16,816
I used to take kick-boxing, but it was
too high-impact. I take tae-bo now.

498
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:20,278
- It's doubled my energy.
- I need that high impact.

499
00:37:20,321 --> 00:37:23,448
RUTH: I know, I take
Native American drumming.

500
00:37:23,491 --> 00:37:25,992
You take tae-bo?

501
00:37:26,327 --> 00:37:28,995
RUTH: Look at those pomegranates.

502
00:37:33,626 --> 00:37:38,505
Our-Lady's bedstraw.
The most poetic herb.

503
00:37:38,547 --> 00:37:41,633
Now, over to you.
Anybody new in your life?

504
00:37:41,676 --> 00:37:44,511
Wow! Twenty minutes.
I can't believe we got this far.

505
00:37:44,553 --> 00:37:48,014
It's my right to check.
What about that Shapiro girl?

506
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:51,268
- Not the Shapiro girl.
- Why? She was a looker.

507
00:37:51,352 --> 00:37:54,396
- The problem was here.
- What? Bad skin?

508
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,606
- No, not bad skin.
- What?

509
00:37:56,691 --> 00:38:01,194
You want an example? I take her out
to dinner. She doesn't want dessert.

510
00:38:01,237 --> 00:38:04,531
I get pecan pie.
She asks for a bite, I give it to her.

511
00:38:04,573 --> 00:38:09,369
Her face swells up like a chipmunk.
She says, "Are there nuts in this?"

512
00:38:09,412 --> 00:38:12,747
- So what?
- Mom, it was pecan pie!

513
00:38:12,832 --> 00:38:17,460
- There must be somebody for you.
- Come on, tell her!

514
00:38:17,545 --> 00:38:20,463
- He's got a very hot prospect.
- Who?

515
00:38:21,048 --> 00:38:24,718
Rachel Rose!
That's who I'm going out with.

516
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:28,471
- ABC Rachel Rose?
- Yes, ABC Rachel Rose.

517
00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:32,183
I could be in-laws
with ABC Rachel Rose.

518
00:38:32,476 --> 00:38:34,185
Peter Jennings would be
at the wedding!

519
00:38:34,228 --> 00:38:39,232
Speaking of in-laws, Ethan and Jackie
took me to her mom's new play.

520
00:38:39,275 --> 00:38:41,568
- How is Ethan?
- He just got promoted.

521
00:38:41,610 --> 00:38:46,573
He's a vice-president now.
They gave him Dad's old office.

522
00:38:48,242 --> 00:38:50,785
How nice. I got to hear this from you.

523
00:38:51,203 --> 00:38:54,831
- Maybe if you called him...
- I don't want to talk about it.

524
00:38:54,957 --> 00:39:00,003
- Mom, he'd love to hear from you.
- Please, Jake, don't spoil this.

525
00:39:00,504 --> 00:39:03,798
I got you, I'm proud of you.
I got this beautiful garden.

526
00:39:03,883 --> 00:39:06,676
I've reconnected with this old friend.

527
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:10,597
Let's just hold hands and breathe.
Together.

528
00:39:14,268 --> 00:39:15,977
- You're not breathing.
- I am.

529
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:19,731
- I don't hear you breathing.
- I don't breathe audibly.

530
00:39:20,858 --> 00:39:22,525
(CHILD SPEAKING SPANISH)

531
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:36,206
Blam!

532
00:39:56,727 --> 00:40:01,689
- All right, I gotta go. I gotta go!
- Gotta go, really gotta go!

533
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:04,192
Why not have that thing
implanted in your ear?

534
00:40:04,276 --> 00:40:06,069
I'll be top on the list.

535
00:40:06,153 --> 00:40:08,571
- ¿ Hola, María, cómo está?
- Beep! Beep!

536
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:12,826
- Hello, young sir!
- Hello, Radio Man.

537
00:40:12,868 --> 00:40:16,871
- It's like I'm in The Godfather.
- I'm God's consigliere.

538
00:40:16,956 --> 00:40:18,998
Gotta go through me to get to Him.

539
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:20,542
Whoa, children.

540
00:40:20,835 --> 00:40:22,502
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

541
00:40:39,854 --> 00:40:43,898
I totally forget
how amazing New York is.

542
00:40:43,983 --> 00:40:48,027
I know. Whoever said it,
it was really true.

543
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:51,322
New Yorkers understand
people living elsewhere

544
00:40:51,365 --> 00:40:53,491
must be, in some sense, kidding.

545
00:41:01,542 --> 00:41:05,420
- Can I ask you a question?
- Yeah, obviously, anything.

546
00:41:05,504 --> 00:41:07,213
It's personal, so...

547
00:41:08,757 --> 00:41:12,760
- Are we gonna have the sex talk?
- Yes!

548
00:41:12,887 --> 00:41:15,930
- I want to know how this works for you.
- It's fine. Fire away.

549
00:41:16,015 --> 00:41:18,766
- Really?
- Yeah, I know you got a list.

550
00:41:18,851 --> 00:41:20,018
Okay.

551
00:41:21,395 --> 00:41:25,148
- Well, you don't, right?
- No.

552
00:41:25,232 --> 00:41:27,358
- At all?
- At all.

553
00:41:28,235 --> 00:41:29,777
So, have you ever...

554
00:41:31,655 --> 00:41:33,907
- Yes!
- Had sex? Yes.

555
00:41:33,991 --> 00:41:36,034
- With women?
- Yes.

556
00:41:36,076 --> 00:41:38,244
- So, you're not gay.
- No.

557
00:41:38,287 --> 00:41:39,913
- Sure?
- Yes.

558
00:41:39,997 --> 00:41:43,416
But even if I was,
the rules are the same.

559
00:41:44,585 --> 00:41:46,461
- Do you miss it?
- No.

560
00:41:46,545 --> 00:41:48,046
- Are you tempted?
- No.

561
00:41:48,088 --> 00:41:51,716
- You'd love it if the rule changed.
- I don't think about it.

562
00:41:51,759 --> 00:41:54,177
- Do you fantasize?
- Not really.

563
00:41:54,261 --> 00:41:57,514
How is that possible?
I've seen how women look at you.

564
00:41:57,723 --> 00:41:59,933
Especially knowing you're a priest.

565
00:42:00,059 --> 00:42:03,686
- I'm not blind, okay.
- How do you deal with that?

566
00:42:03,771 --> 00:42:07,774
It's not an issue for me. It's really not.

567
00:42:07,858 --> 00:42:10,443
- Really?
- I'm past that point.

568
00:42:10,778 --> 00:42:13,947
I'm completely committed to what I do.

569
00:42:14,031 --> 00:42:17,784
To my work. It defines me,
completely, as a person.

570
00:42:18,285 --> 00:42:21,871
And it fulfills me. I'm very happy.

571
00:42:22,456 --> 00:42:26,125
That particular sacrifice is a gesture,
a symbol of my commitment.

572
00:42:26,794 --> 00:42:30,046
- Quite a gesture.
- I know it seems that way.

573
00:42:30,130 --> 00:42:33,550
It's like giving up smoking,
the first year is tough,

574
00:42:33,634 --> 00:42:36,302
but then you don't care
if you see people smoke.

575
00:42:36,387 --> 00:42:38,805
I quit two years ago
and when I see smokers,

576
00:42:38,847 --> 00:42:42,392
I want to French kiss them
to suck the smoke out of their lungs.

577
00:42:42,476 --> 00:42:44,561
Well, don't be a priest!

578
00:42:45,479 --> 00:42:50,233
I really admire your commitment.
I don't think I could take it.

579
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:52,735
You've sacrificed for what you do.

580
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:57,532
There comes a point
where I just crave contact,

581
00:42:57,741 --> 00:43:02,829
you know, like I want
to touch someone, and be touched.

582
00:43:04,665 --> 00:43:05,915
You're amazing.

583
00:43:08,168 --> 00:43:10,169
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

584
00:43:13,382 --> 00:43:16,301
- Thus endeth the sex conversation?
- Thus endeth.

585
00:43:19,179 --> 00:43:22,807
I bet no one ever asks
the Dalai Lama these questions.

586
00:43:30,024 --> 00:43:35,361
Len, don't argue with me.
I have it right here, and it's not right.

587
00:43:35,404 --> 00:43:39,616
I'll be back in an hour, run it again.
God, I hate these Harvard guys!

588
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:46,122
Rachel Rose! When's that going down?

589
00:43:46,206 --> 00:43:48,541
- Thursday.
- Thursday night, 8: 00 p. M. Dinner.

590
00:43:48,917 --> 00:43:51,878
- Are you excited?
- Yeah, I have a pretty good feeling.

591
00:43:52,755 --> 00:43:56,883
- Where are you taking her?
- I thought Ernie's.

592
00:43:56,967 --> 00:44:01,763
You can't take her to Ernie's!
It's been around since we were kids!

593
00:44:02,348 --> 00:44:05,850
- You cannot take Rachel Rose there.
- (NASALLY) Definitely not.

594
00:44:05,893 --> 00:44:10,104
- You must go somewhere new and hot.
- Definitely hot.

595
00:44:10,189 --> 00:44:12,815
- What's new and hot?
- What do we know about her?

596
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:17,236
Twenty-nine years old, journalism
school, Middle East Affairs expert.

597
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:20,031
Perfect. Middle Eastern.
She can order in Arabic.

598
00:44:21,742 --> 00:44:25,703
- What's a good place?
- Delphini's. Four stars.

599
00:44:25,746 --> 00:44:27,038
You need a reservation.

600
00:44:27,081 --> 00:44:31,250
- Will you wear a suit, or go casual?
- I don't know. I guess cas...

601
00:44:31,418 --> 00:44:35,004
- No, suit, definitely a suit.
- Shut up, Rain Man. Seriously!

602
00:44:36,423 --> 00:44:39,384
- Now you're making me think.
- Relax.

603
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:41,219
What if you guys came with me?

604
00:44:42,429 --> 00:44:46,265
Bring a priest on your date?
What kind of strategy is that?

605
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:50,978
Not a priest, my friend Brian,
and his girlfriend, Anna. A double date.

606
00:44:52,481 --> 00:44:55,358
Pretend you're a couple. Are you busy?

607
00:44:55,693 --> 00:44:59,112
- You could bring your cell phone.
- That's not the point.

608
00:44:59,196 --> 00:45:02,865
- What's the point?
- You don't need a chaperone.

609
00:45:02,950 --> 00:45:06,744
I don't need a chaperone,
I need some help. Please?

610
00:45:07,371 --> 00:45:09,372
I'm begging you.

611
00:45:12,376 --> 00:45:16,129
That's how the business is going.
People want news to be edgy.

612
00:45:16,171 --> 00:45:19,006
- That's why Brokaw stands now.
- What?

613
00:45:19,091 --> 00:45:22,552
- Tom Brokaw stands to read the news.
- The whole time?

614
00:45:22,803 --> 00:45:24,595
- Yeah.
- He does?

615
00:45:25,639 --> 00:45:29,142
- He's done it for about a year now.
- Really? I gotta watch the news more.

616
00:45:29,476 --> 00:45:32,562
I saw your sarin gas report.
It was very powerful.

617
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:35,648
Thanks.
I earned my stripes with that piece.

618
00:45:35,941 --> 00:45:40,737
- I got through a bris without fainting.
- I vetoed the "McOyster."

619
00:45:41,071 --> 00:45:43,990
- A grateful nation thanks you.
- Made me a star.

620
00:45:44,241 --> 00:45:46,868
So, how long have you two
been together?

621
00:45:48,245 --> 00:45:50,997
- Oh, right...
- God, we go way back.

622
00:45:51,081 --> 00:45:53,833
We've all known each other
since we were kids.

623
00:45:53,917 --> 00:45:56,169
- I had a crush on Anna.
- Really?

624
00:45:56,211 --> 00:46:00,006
- I told you that. She knew that.
- No, you didn't!

625
00:46:01,133 --> 00:46:04,469
Anyway, we reconnected
a couple of months ago,

626
00:46:04,511 --> 00:46:07,972
and we just clicked, very unexpectedly.

627
00:46:08,015 --> 00:46:11,100
I think it's great
to be friends first, don't you?

628
00:46:11,185 --> 00:46:14,020
Always. Friends first.

629
00:46:15,689 --> 00:46:18,483
So, do you write your own reports?

630
00:46:18,567 --> 00:46:22,028
Yeah. I wouldn't trust
anyone else to get them right.

631
00:46:22,112 --> 00:46:25,573
You write your own sermons, right?

632
00:46:25,657 --> 00:46:27,200
Actually, I download them off the Net.

633
00:46:27,242 --> 00:46:32,371
- I use www. Hotgod.com.
- Really?

634
00:46:32,539 --> 00:46:34,081
- (KICKING)
- Ow!

635
00:46:34,708 --> 00:46:37,835
No. No, I was kidding.

636
00:46:38,045 --> 00:46:40,755
- So, you do write your own sermons?
- Yeah.

637
00:46:41,006 --> 00:46:43,007
He writes beautiful sermons.

638
00:46:43,050 --> 00:46:47,720
Actually, I like to improvise.
Keeps everybody on their toes.

639
00:46:47,805 --> 00:46:51,849
I guess you can't do that
too much with the news.

640
00:46:51,892 --> 00:46:54,393
- What?
- Riff.

641
00:46:55,437 --> 00:46:56,938
No, not really.

642
00:47:05,823 --> 00:47:08,825
I bet the Middle East is lovely
this time of year.

643
00:47:09,409 --> 00:47:12,036
Well, not if you're Kurdish.

644
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:14,038
(PAGER BEEPS)

645
00:47:14,081 --> 00:47:15,748
Excuse me.

646
00:47:18,043 --> 00:47:22,672
Oh, my God! The Iraqi Defense Minister
just committed suicide.

647
00:47:23,215 --> 00:47:26,175
- Is that bad or good?
- Well, it...

648
00:47:27,594 --> 00:47:31,222
- Brian, would you explain it to him?
- I will.

649
00:47:33,892 --> 00:47:36,769
- How's it going?
- She's beautiful.

650
00:47:36,895 --> 00:47:39,814
- She's great, too.
- She's very adult.

651
00:47:39,898 --> 00:47:44,277
- You're doing great, we're impressed.
- You look so hot in your suit.

652
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:49,490
- Thank you. You look beautiful.
- You do. You look amazing.

653
00:47:49,616 --> 00:47:53,703
- Thanks, men.
- There's something about you tonight.

654
00:47:53,996 --> 00:47:56,455
- An absence...
- The cell phone.

655
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:57,582
Uh-uh-uh!

656
00:47:58,125 --> 00:48:00,293
- It's set to vibrate.
- Oh, my...

657
00:48:01,378 --> 00:48:05,214
- Wow. That's sexy.
- Don't you want to be free of that?

658
00:48:05,299 --> 00:48:10,887
No. You don't understand.
I have a relationship with my phone.

659
00:48:11,013 --> 00:48:13,973
We have a chemistry together.
I can't explain it.

660
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:18,269
- Chemistry's a funny thing.
- Yes, it is.

661
00:48:18,312 --> 00:48:21,314
Are you speaking abstractly,
or specifically?

662
00:48:23,025 --> 00:48:24,692
Abstractly.

663
00:48:28,780 --> 00:48:32,241
Well, looks like I'm going to Baghdad.

664
00:48:32,743 --> 00:48:35,828
- Two seconds. It was a pleasure.
- Yeah.

665
00:48:36,246 --> 00:48:38,789
- Nice to meet you.
- Good luck to you both.

666
00:48:38,832 --> 00:48:41,250
- Talk to you soon.
- All right.

667
00:48:41,335 --> 00:48:44,003
- I'll talk to you.
- Okay, call me.

668
00:48:44,046 --> 00:48:46,505
- Call me soon.
- Thanks, again.

669
00:48:46,548 --> 00:48:48,049
Bye.

670
00:48:57,643 --> 00:48:59,310
What are you thinking about, right now?

671
00:49:00,771 --> 00:49:01,854
It's funny.

672
00:49:01,939 --> 00:49:03,940
- I was at the Met yesterday.
- Again?

673
00:49:04,024 --> 00:49:06,859
I go every week,
and I noticed a painting,

674
00:49:06,902 --> 00:49:10,029
a watercolor by Bonnard
I've passed every time.

675
00:49:10,072 --> 00:49:16,327
This time I looked at it, and I was
just riveted. It was so beautiful.

676
00:49:18,664 --> 00:49:20,790
I was just wondering
why I never saw it before.

677
00:49:22,584 --> 00:49:27,254
Sometimes we don't see things
until we're ready to see them

678
00:49:27,381 --> 00:49:30,466
in a certain way. You know?

679
00:49:32,010 --> 00:49:33,886
Very true.

680
00:49:37,349 --> 00:49:38,849
Yeah.

681
00:49:41,019 --> 00:49:43,145
What's going on with Ruth and Ethan?

682
00:49:43,730 --> 00:49:45,064
Oh, uh...

683
00:49:45,899 --> 00:49:50,069
Ethan married a Catholic girl,
and that did not go over well.

684
00:49:50,404 --> 00:49:54,198
- That's why they're fighting?
- Not fighting. They're not talking.

685
00:49:54,616 --> 00:49:58,411
- Two years now. No comunicado.
- Are you serious?

686
00:49:58,495 --> 00:50:02,790
- Totally. It's...
- What? Weren't they close, then?

687
00:50:02,958 --> 00:50:05,960
- As close as Ruth and Jake.
- Wow.

688
00:50:08,463 --> 00:50:11,090
- That explains a lot.
- Yeah.

689
00:50:11,133 --> 00:50:13,884
You see why tonight was not just a date.

690
00:50:14,928 --> 00:50:16,095
Hmm!

691
00:50:21,476 --> 00:50:25,104
I feel terrible about
having to cut the night short.

692
00:50:25,272 --> 00:50:28,107
I totally understand.
When the beeper beeps...

693
00:50:28,942 --> 00:50:30,901
I'm just going to be packing.

694
00:50:30,944 --> 00:50:35,823
Would you like to come up
for a nightcap, keep me company?

695
00:50:39,369 --> 00:50:44,081
I'd love to, but I should leave you.
I mean, you're going to Baghdad.

696
00:50:44,124 --> 00:50:48,210
Yeah. Yeah, long flight, I know.
Well, okay.

697
00:50:48,336 --> 00:50:52,423
But when you get back,
we should definitely get together.

698
00:50:53,133 --> 00:50:56,469
- I would love to. It's a date.
- Okay.

699
00:50:58,346 --> 00:51:00,181
- Bye.
- Bye.

700
00:51:14,112 --> 00:51:15,112
Taxi!

701
00:51:21,286 --> 00:51:23,412
- Well, this is me.
- Okay.

702
00:51:23,497 --> 00:51:26,165
You wanna come up for a while?

703
00:51:26,291 --> 00:51:30,336
I'd love to, but I should get home.
I have an early conference call.

704
00:51:30,837 --> 00:51:33,172
Me, too. I gotta talk to the big guy.

705
00:51:35,467 --> 00:51:37,301
- Right.
- Calls early.

706
00:51:38,553 --> 00:51:41,680
- Rain check, though.
- Yeah, definitely.

707
00:51:42,766 --> 00:51:44,058
Goodnight.

708
00:51:46,269 --> 00:51:48,521
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

709
00:52:16,216 --> 00:52:18,008
- Hi.
- Hi.

710
00:52:20,428 --> 00:52:24,890
- What are you doing here?
- I don't know, what am I doing here?

711
00:52:43,577 --> 00:52:45,161
ANNA: I haven't screamed that hard

712
00:52:45,245 --> 00:52:47,580
since the US hockey team
beat the Russians.

713
00:52:47,664 --> 00:52:52,543
Incredible. I wanted to do that
since you walked off that airplane.

714
00:52:52,627 --> 00:52:56,881
Really? Right away?
You hadn't seen me in 16 years.

715
00:52:57,090 --> 00:53:01,010
I know! You were this tough,
sexy businesswoman.

716
00:53:01,094 --> 00:53:05,639
I just wanted to pull you into security
and give you a cavity search.

717
00:53:06,892 --> 00:53:09,268
That would have been impulsive.

718
00:53:09,311 --> 00:53:13,105
Well, this is pretty impulsive, for me.

719
00:53:15,108 --> 00:53:18,277
- Believe me.
- It felt good though, right?

720
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:22,072
Yeah, good.
Just, I mean, a little complicated.

721
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:29,496
What would people at work think
if they knew you slept with a rabbi?

722
00:53:29,581 --> 00:53:31,582
Could be a scandal.

723
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:34,960
Oh.

724
00:53:37,631 --> 00:53:38,964
- Listen.
- Yeah?

725
00:53:39,466 --> 00:53:44,094
You know what my life is like.
I'm only here for a little while.

726
00:53:44,137 --> 00:53:45,471
Yes.

727
00:53:46,306 --> 00:53:49,934
And I'm fine, just hanging out,
having a great time with you.

728
00:53:52,812 --> 00:53:57,149
But sometimes I want
to jump you, too. What can I say?

729
00:53:58,568 --> 00:54:03,656
- Is that okay?
- That's okay. It's more than okay.

730
00:54:06,701 --> 00:54:10,204
ANNA: Think we should
say anything to Brian?

731
00:54:10,789 --> 00:54:14,917
I think it might be a little weird for him.

732
00:54:15,794 --> 00:54:20,673
- You don't think he'd understand?
- No, I just... I don't know.

733
00:54:21,091 --> 00:54:24,093
I think we should just keep it simple.

734
00:54:25,679 --> 00:54:27,346
I'm for simple.

735
00:54:28,848 --> 00:54:32,518
I have something simple
I'd like to discuss with you.

736
00:54:32,978 --> 00:54:35,396
(SLOW SONG PLAYING)

737
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:38,274
Do you want to know

738
00:54:38,358 --> 00:54:44,822
If everything glittering
will turn into the gold

739
00:54:45,156 --> 00:54:50,494
I see in your hair?
I feel it could be there

740
00:54:51,079 --> 00:54:55,374
Somehow tonight

741
00:54:58,044 --> 00:55:00,921
And do you want to find

742
00:55:01,006 --> 00:55:07,261
Something worth saving?
The change would do me right

743
00:55:07,721 --> 00:55:13,100
I've been just waiting
and hesitating

744
00:55:13,226 --> 00:55:15,102
With this heart

745
00:55:17,272 --> 00:55:23,235
Of mine

746
00:55:27,282 --> 00:55:29,366
You're still a mystery

747
00:55:29,743 --> 00:55:36,248
But there's something so easy
in how you're sweet to me

748
00:55:37,208 --> 00:55:42,212
I feel completed
Like it's something I needed

749
00:55:42,255 --> 00:55:44,590
For this heart

750
00:55:46,301 --> 00:55:52,389
Of mine

751
00:55:56,811 --> 00:56:01,482
There's always something so tragic

752
00:56:02,942 --> 00:56:07,446
About a hopeless romantic

753
00:56:24,047 --> 00:56:27,800
We have a Jake Schram here
for Anna Reilly. Yes?

754
00:56:28,927 --> 00:56:30,010
Okay.

755
00:56:31,179 --> 00:56:34,973
I'll be coming here a lot,
so let's forget this name thing,

756
00:56:35,016 --> 00:56:38,936
you can just say, "Hey, Jake,"
and I'll say, "Hey, T-Bone."

757
00:56:40,730 --> 00:56:43,816
- That pass is good for one hour.
- Okay. Thank you.

758
00:56:44,984 --> 00:56:49,738
Wednesday night, you have a call
at 7:00 and dinner at 8:00.

759
00:56:49,823 --> 00:56:53,117
All right. I'll make the call,
but cancel the dinner. I have a class.

760
00:56:54,536 --> 00:56:56,745
He's late.

761
00:56:58,164 --> 00:57:01,875
Oh, my God.
Are you guys getting serious?

762
00:57:02,544 --> 00:57:05,337
- No, no, no.
- Yes, you are.

763
00:57:05,422 --> 00:57:07,798
- No, we're not.
- I saw it, I can tell!

764
00:57:07,841 --> 00:57:10,592
No, no... Oh, he's here!

765
00:57:11,845 --> 00:57:13,679
- Hey.
- Hi.

766
00:57:15,223 --> 00:57:18,934
Debbie, this is Jake. Jake, vice versa.

767
00:57:19,018 --> 00:57:20,978
- How you doing?
- Hi, Jake.

768
00:57:21,020 --> 00:57:25,274
Can I just say... Good. Good for you.

769
00:57:25,358 --> 00:57:27,526
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

770
00:57:28,736 --> 00:57:32,406
- Ah, Debbie...
- Debbie... Debbie, what?

771
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:34,450
Oh!

772
00:57:34,784 --> 00:57:36,577
The numbers are good for you, now?

773
00:57:37,078 --> 00:57:42,875
Good. Just run one more scenario
and assume an 8% I RR.

774
00:57:42,959 --> 00:57:44,418
Bye.

775
00:57:47,964 --> 00:57:50,883
- Hi.
- You're really gonna run an 8% I RR?

776
00:57:50,925 --> 00:57:54,595
- I'd go with 15%, at least.
- Stick with the Torah.

777
00:57:54,679 --> 00:57:58,807
Look at this place. It's ridiculous!
It's so impressive. Wow!

778
00:57:58,892 --> 00:58:00,100
(INAUDIBLE)

779
00:58:00,185 --> 00:58:03,020
- Try again. Hey.
- Hi.

780
00:58:03,313 --> 00:58:05,981
Can we close your blinds and... What?

781
00:58:06,065 --> 00:58:09,318
- Remember that guy I told you about?
- The guy...

782
00:58:09,402 --> 00:58:13,614
Mr. 23rd Floor? Check it out.
There, with the huge plant.

783
00:58:13,740 --> 00:58:16,325
- Nothing interesting will be going on...
- Trust me.

784
00:58:19,245 --> 00:58:22,247
- Holy Majoly!
- Told you.

785
00:58:23,625 --> 00:58:28,378
Does he have music on in there?
He's, like, porn-slapping her.

786
00:58:28,796 --> 00:58:34,343
- Okay, we should go now.
- He has healthy self-confidence.

787
00:58:34,594 --> 00:58:38,305
- Ready? Let's go.
- Hang on, I'm learning something here.

788
00:58:39,015 --> 00:58:41,600
- We'll be late.
- You'll benefit from this.

789
00:58:43,019 --> 00:58:45,229
ANNA: I can't Wednesday night,
I've a class.

790
00:58:45,271 --> 00:58:46,813
JAKE: What class?

791
00:58:46,898 --> 00:58:50,359
ANNA: I try new things.
I'm embarrassed talking about it.

792
00:58:50,443 --> 00:58:53,654
JAKE: Don't be embarrassed.
Many people take aikido.

793
00:58:53,738 --> 00:58:55,781
- Nope.
- Line-dancing.

794
00:58:55,823 --> 00:58:59,910
- Not even close.
- What's the big deal, why can't I know?

795
00:58:59,953 --> 00:59:02,037
- Feng shui?
- No!

796
00:59:02,413 --> 00:59:05,999
Don't be embarrassed if it is.
Don't tell me, I don't need to know.

797
00:59:06,084 --> 00:59:09,545
I like the "mysterioso" quality.
It's very sexy.

798
00:59:09,629 --> 00:59:13,006
- That's good. All right. I gotta pee.
- Hold on, I want to tell you something.

799
00:59:15,260 --> 00:59:16,260
(KISSING)

800
00:59:16,970 --> 00:59:18,971
Hold that thought.

801
00:59:25,728 --> 00:59:31,108
- Look who's here!
- Hey! Hey!

802
00:59:31,150 --> 00:59:36,238
Holy... How you doing?
Larry, Ellen, what are you doing here?

803
00:59:36,489 --> 00:59:40,409
We're buying a turkey!
No, we're seeing a movie.

804
00:59:40,493 --> 00:59:42,786
Are you alone?

805
00:59:43,162 --> 00:59:46,206
No. I mean, I'm with an old friend.

806
00:59:46,374 --> 00:59:50,919
Why, when Emma Gerber
wants you to take her daughter out?

807
00:59:51,004 --> 00:59:53,672
You should call,
the family's very wealthy.

808
00:59:53,715 --> 00:59:57,009
- Though she's no Rachel Rose.
- They can make donations.

809
00:59:57,093 --> 01:00:01,555
I've got to call her, but right now

Listen to you! That's incredible!

972
01:11:49,972 --> 01:11:53,558
If you think I had no life before...
I'll disappear.

973
01:11:53,642 --> 01:11:57,228
But this is everything
you've worked for, right?

974
01:11:57,313 --> 01:12:00,398
I'm so proud of you,
I'm so happy for you.

975
01:12:00,482 --> 01:12:04,193
Well, here's the thing, Jake.

976
01:12:04,236 --> 01:12:06,738
I've been thinking about it, and...

977
01:12:07,406 --> 01:12:11,743
I'm excited, but not as excited
as I am about you and me.

978
01:12:12,077 --> 01:12:15,204
And so I don't think I wanna go,

979
01:12:15,247 --> 01:12:19,208
because I wanna be near you,
so I thought I'd transfer and stay here.

980
01:12:21,253 --> 01:12:22,920
What do you think?

981
01:12:23,881 --> 01:12:24,922
Wow!

982
01:12:27,343 --> 01:12:31,095
That's... unexpected.

983
01:12:31,764 --> 01:12:33,264
- It is?
- Yeah.

984
01:12:34,600 --> 01:12:37,268
Are you sure that's the best thing?

985
01:12:37,936 --> 01:12:39,562
For you?

986
01:12:39,605 --> 01:12:40,772
Oh.

987
01:12:40,856 --> 01:12:43,775
I don't know. I thought you'd be excited.

988
01:12:43,859 --> 01:12:46,778
No... No, I am. I'm just...

989
01:12:46,987 --> 01:12:49,655
I'm sorry, I thought...
Am I off-base here?

990
01:12:49,740 --> 01:12:55,870
No, you're not. It was just an impulse.
It's totally fine. Really.

991
01:12:55,954 --> 01:13:00,208
- I thought that we...
- I think that tequila made me giddy.

992
01:13:00,292 --> 01:13:02,210
Shall we go somewhere
and talk about this?

993
01:13:02,336 --> 01:13:04,170
No, no, no.

994
01:13:04,254 --> 01:13:10,218
No, it's so fine. I'm having
a great time. Let's have fun, okay?

995
01:13:11,887 --> 01:13:14,138
No, I don't... Oh...

996
01:13:15,557 --> 01:13:17,433
Whoo! Let's go dance!

997
01:13:17,851 --> 01:13:19,477
(MUSIC PLAYING)

998
01:13:20,104 --> 01:13:23,606
I never had no problems, yeah

1000
01:13:28,529 --> 01:13:31,364

(SINGS TRADITIONAL JEWISH SONG)

1002
01:14:17,578 --> 01:14:20,538
- Amen.
- Amen.

1003
01:14:21,540 --> 01:14:23,082
- Oh, my!
- Psycho, psycho!

1004
01:14:26,211 --> 01:14:28,337
I can't laugh, I'm so full.

1005
01:14:28,630 --> 01:14:31,841
How'd you stay so skinny
with cooking like this?

1006
01:14:31,884 --> 01:14:36,304
He was blessed with my genes.
Ethan, that's another story.

1007
01:14:36,388 --> 01:14:38,806
When he was a kid, he was a little chub!

1008
01:14:39,683 --> 01:14:42,935
He missed school once
because he couldn't fit his pants.

1009
01:14:43,020 --> 01:14:46,397
- You're joking.
- It's true, he had to call in fat.

1010
01:14:47,900 --> 01:14:50,985
Mom, he never called in fat, come on.

1011
01:14:51,236 --> 01:14:54,071
Give the guy a break, he looks great.

1012
01:14:54,156 --> 01:15:00,203
He's working out with a trainer,
he's on a regimen, he looks trim.

1013
01:15:00,245 --> 01:15:02,747
He looks trim because she can't cook.

1014
01:15:02,789 --> 01:15:06,125
She's a good cook.
You'd know if you tried her food.

1015
01:15:06,210 --> 01:15:08,920
I don't wanna talk about this anymore.
Get it?

1016
01:15:09,713 --> 01:15:11,339
I'm sorry. Sorry.

1017
01:15:12,674 --> 01:15:14,759
What were we talking about?

1018
01:15:14,885 --> 01:15:18,179
The meal was so good. Thank you.

1019
01:15:18,263 --> 01:15:22,225
- As always.
- Someone has to feed the skinny ones.

1020
01:15:23,060 --> 01:15:25,978
Now you guys get the dishes,
and the ladies will talk.

1021
01:15:28,440 --> 01:15:30,775
Jake, put on some water for tea.

1022
01:15:51,797 --> 01:15:55,841
ANNA: It's like a fairy tale.
Those flowers framing you.

1023
01:15:56,468 --> 01:15:59,845
- That's called a huppah.
- Wow.

1024
01:16:02,558 --> 01:16:07,603
Oh, my God.
You look so beautiful together!

1025
01:16:07,646 --> 01:16:11,482
Please. We were so young.
We were kids.

1026
01:16:12,317 --> 01:16:15,528
I give Jake grief,
but you're all doing it the right way.

1027
01:16:15,612 --> 01:16:20,324
It takes at least ten years to know
yourself well and stop being an idiot.

1028
01:16:20,993 --> 01:16:24,120
It's hard enough without
binding yourself to another idiot.

1029
01:16:25,289 --> 01:16:30,251
What's scary is spending ten years
going after important things,

1030
01:16:30,335 --> 01:16:35,006
you get those things, then suspect
you went after the wrong things,

1031
01:16:35,048 --> 01:16:39,885
and, in regard to the important things,
you're still an idiot.

1032
01:16:42,014 --> 01:16:44,015
Can I ask you a question?

1033
01:16:46,310 --> 01:16:48,269
Is my son a good kisser?

1034
01:16:50,230 --> 01:16:53,649
- You're in a good mood.
- I'm usually in a good mood.

1035
01:16:54,735 --> 01:16:57,778
But you're in a particularly
good mood right now.

1036
01:16:57,863 --> 01:17:02,700
Okay. Yes, I am.
I'm in a very good mood.

1037
01:17:03,535 --> 01:17:06,078
Okay. Do you want to share anything?

1038
01:17:10,834 --> 01:17:15,546
- Not quite yet. Maybe soon.
- Really? Soon?

1039
01:17:15,589 --> 01:17:16,881
Okay.

1040
01:17:16,923 --> 01:17:18,883
- Well, you let me know.
- Okay, I will.

1041
01:17:18,925 --> 01:17:20,885
I'll be looking out for that.

1042
01:17:21,136 --> 01:17:22,720
That's what she said...

1043
01:17:25,724 --> 01:17:28,309
- I'm so sorry.
- Jesus, what happened?

1044
01:17:30,646 --> 01:17:34,231
- Nothing.
- Girl talk. We're fine.

1045
01:17:38,153 --> 01:17:41,614
I didn't go into explicit detail.

1046
01:17:41,698 --> 01:17:44,241
I can't believe you did that.
It's between us!

1047
01:17:44,284 --> 01:17:46,744
Jake, she figured it out on her own.

1048
01:17:46,787 --> 01:17:50,331
- Did you try to deny it?
- Come on, Jake, she knew!

1049
01:17:51,583 --> 01:17:53,209
No wonder she was crying!

1050
01:17:53,251 --> 01:17:57,755
I was crying, too, all right?
We had a nice talk about it.

1051
01:17:57,881 --> 01:18:00,007
She was upset, but not angry.

1052
01:18:00,092 --> 01:18:03,010
- She put on that face.
- She didn't.

1053
01:18:03,095 --> 01:18:05,721
I know, okay? All right? I mean...

1054
01:18:06,223 --> 01:18:08,974
You have no idea of the nightmare
I'm in for now.

1055
01:18:09,059 --> 01:18:12,603
This is not a nightmare, okay? Stop it.

1056
01:18:13,105 --> 01:18:15,398
Hey, look at me.

1057
01:18:16,358 --> 01:18:17,733
Look at me.

1058
01:18:21,655 --> 01:18:25,032
- I am in love with you, Jake.
- I love you, too.

1059
01:18:25,742 --> 01:18:31,122
No. You are in love with me,
you're just scared of what it involves.

1060
01:18:31,164 --> 01:18:35,292
- Yes, I am.
- Me, too, but I'm dealing with it.

1061
01:18:35,335 --> 01:18:39,797
Because I'm overwhelmed by feelings
for you and I want to work it out.

1062
01:18:39,840 --> 01:18:42,800
- Great, how do I work it out?
- Okay.

1063
01:18:42,843 --> 01:18:47,888
Let's take it from the top. It's not about
your mother, brother, or synagogue.

1064
01:18:47,973 --> 01:18:50,474
Just you. What do you need
to work it out?

1065
01:18:50,559 --> 01:18:54,854
Those things are me, understand?
I can't separate them out.

1066
01:18:54,980 --> 01:19:00,151
It's hard to accept, but the fact
you're not Jewish is a problem for me.

1067
01:19:00,360 --> 01:19:01,986
I don't think so.

1068
01:19:02,863 --> 01:19:07,324
Okay, all I'm saying is that
you should be honest with yourself.

1069
01:19:07,409 --> 01:19:11,996
I think if it was just up to you,
you'd stick with this relationship,

1070
01:19:12,080 --> 01:19:16,584
but it's a problem because you think
other people can't deal with it.

1071
01:19:16,668 --> 01:19:20,504
- No, they can't.
- Give them credit, it's the 21 st century.

1072
01:19:20,589 --> 01:19:25,593
What does the 21 st century have to
do with anything? This is you and me!

1073
01:19:25,677 --> 01:19:30,514
- I thought we were just having fun.
- That's my point, I'm having fun.

1074
01:19:30,766 --> 01:19:34,059
I'm having fun, too. This is a lot of fun!

1075
01:19:34,186 --> 01:19:37,563
Exactly. So, why throw it away?

1076
01:19:42,110 --> 01:19:48,073
Can't you see that you're asking me
to risk losing everything I value,

1077
01:19:48,158 --> 01:19:50,034
just to see if we work?

1078
01:19:52,621 --> 01:19:54,663
I mean, I love you, but...

1079
01:19:55,749 --> 01:19:59,710
We're different in so many ways
unrelated to you not being Jewish.

1080
01:20:00,504 --> 01:20:02,046
What are you saying?

1081
01:20:02,088 --> 01:20:05,633
We have totally different priorities.
Look at your life.

1082
01:20:06,343 --> 01:20:09,386
I don't think there's room in your life
for what I'm spiritually committed to.

1083
01:20:11,890 --> 01:20:13,557
That is so unfair.

1084
01:20:16,895 --> 01:20:20,523
Your faith is a huge part
of what I love about you.

1085
01:20:20,941 --> 01:20:26,904
But you must be patient. It doesn't
come as easily for others as for you.

1086
01:20:27,572 --> 01:20:31,534
You will never find the kind
of relationship I know you want,

1087
01:20:31,576 --> 01:20:35,746
and you will never be the kind
of spiritual leader you could be

1088
01:20:35,789 --> 01:20:38,415
until you learn to put faith
in other people.

1089
01:20:40,961 --> 01:20:44,088
I'm not saying we should marry,
all I'm saying

1090
01:20:44,172 --> 01:20:48,342
is that I'm in love with you,
and I want to give it a real shot.

1091
01:20:50,804 --> 01:20:52,805
I don't know what to say.

1092
01:20:53,014 --> 01:20:56,851
How about, "I've always wanted
someone like you, and I won't lose you."

1093
01:21:04,568 --> 01:21:05,943
I'm sorry...

1094
01:21:08,113 --> 01:21:11,740
You will be when you realize I've gone
and I'm not coming back.

1095
01:21:16,413 --> 01:21:18,914
This is my apartment. You get out.

- I'm sorry.

1098
01:21:30,302 --> 01:21:32,761

I need to talk to you.
Can you come over? Please?

Don't move. I'll be right over.
No, I'll be right there. Okay.

01:22:07,339 --> 01:22:09,673
- Are you okay?
- Terrific.

1106

- I came running right over.
- Sorry, I didn't mean to call so late.

No, it's fine, don't worry. What's wrong?

- Everything.
- What?

- Me!
- You? You're perfect.

- I am a loser!
- You're not, what are you saying?

- I'm a workaholic.
- No, you're not.

Okay, yes, you are. But you're our
workaholic, and we're proud of you.

1114
01:22:37,577 --> 01:22:39,328
- Brian...
- What?

1115
01:22:39,663 --> 01:22:44,041
You're my friend, and if I ask you
something, you'll answer honestly?

1116
01:22:44,459 --> 01:22:46,418
Of course, you know I will.

1117
01:22:47,420 --> 01:22:50,881
When you look at me,
when you look at my life,

1118
01:22:50,966 --> 01:22:55,302
do you think, "There's a girl
whose values are all out of whack?"

1119
01:22:56,221 --> 01:22:58,764
No, and certainly not in that voice.

1120
01:22:58,890 --> 01:23:00,766
- Have I got no spirit?
- What?

1121
01:23:00,850 --> 01:23:03,018
I know I'm fun to hang out with,

1122
01:23:03,061 --> 01:23:06,605
but does my life seem shallow to you?

1123
01:23:07,565 --> 01:23:12,069
- Am I spiritually empty?
- No, are you crazy?

1124
01:23:12,570 --> 01:23:17,408
You've got more spirit in you
than most guys in robes out there.

1125

You're a natural, you radiate.

Trust me. What's going on here?
What's this about?

1127
01:23:27,085 --> 01:23:29,461
I don't even know where to begin, Brian.

1128
01:23:30,088 --> 01:23:33,757
You're my best friend,
and I've been keeping stuff from you.

1129

Now something has happened,
and I can't keep it from you anymore.

1131
01:23:41,599 --> 01:23:43,934
- It's okay.
- It's not okay.

1132
01:23:43,977 --> 01:23:47,521
There are things I have to say,
and I feel bad.

1133
01:23:47,605 --> 01:23:53,110
- I have things to say, too.
- Mine are big and bad. I need to...

1134
01:23:53,194 --> 01:23:55,279
No, please, just listen...

1135
01:24:00,285 --> 01:24:03,162
- I love you, too.
- What?

1136
01:24:05,123 --> 01:24:09,293
I love you, that's what you want to say,
but you're scared, so I'll say it first.

1137
01:24:13,214 --> 01:24:16,717
- Brian...
- It's okay, trust me. Trust me.

1138
01:24:17,135 --> 01:24:20,804
We can't fight it,
it's too strong. It's okay.

1139
01:24:21,306 --> 01:24:23,640
No, Brian, I can't!

1140
01:24:27,020 --> 01:24:28,979
It's the vows, isn't it?

1141
01:24:30,356 --> 01:24:33,817
It's the vows, they make
you feel guilty. I can't believe it.

1142
01:24:34,235 --> 01:24:37,654
I shouldn't have had
that sex talk with you, I knew it.

1143
01:24:37,739 --> 01:24:41,825
I knew it. In my head,
a voice said, "Don't go here..."

1144
01:24:41,910 --> 01:24:43,577
You don't understand.

1145
01:24:43,661 --> 01:24:47,790
Right now, for the first time ever,
I feel jealous of Jake.

1146
01:24:47,832 --> 01:24:52,461
I envy him. This would be so easy
if I was him. I picked the wrong gig.

1147
01:24:52,504 --> 01:24:54,838
- Let me talk to you!
- Admit it!

1148
01:24:54,964 --> 01:24:58,675
If I was a rabbi,
you could love me without guilt.

1149
01:24:58,843 --> 01:25:01,011
- Listen to me!
- What?

1150
01:25:02,722 --> 01:25:05,182
I am in love with a rabbi.

1151
01:25:06,392 --> 01:25:09,728
- Sorry?
- I'm in love with Jake.

1152
01:25:10,522 --> 01:25:12,022
(SCOFFS) Yeah.

1153
01:25:15,360 --> 01:25:17,986
That's what I was trying to tell you.

1154
01:25:20,406 --> 01:25:25,828
I'm stunned.
I'm stunned, I'm paralyzed... What?

1155
01:25:30,041 --> 01:25:32,626
Excuse me, my mouth just went all dry.

1156
01:25:33,628 --> 01:25:37,798
I can't believe this.
When did this happen?

1157
01:25:37,882 --> 01:25:40,634
- We've been together since July.
- July?

1158
01:25:41,052 --> 01:25:42,761
(SQUEAKS) Oh!

1159
01:25:43,555 --> 01:25:44,555
July?

1160
01:25:44,639 --> 01:25:49,768
We should have told you,
but we weren't sure how you'd react.

1161
01:25:49,853 --> 01:25:54,857
I'm glad you saved it, because
it's definitely less weird for me now.

1162
01:25:54,899 --> 01:25:58,026
Brian...

1163
01:25:58,069 --> 01:26:00,445
Let's talk about this. You don't drink.

1164
01:26:00,905 --> 01:26:04,491
In light of recent revelations,
no one is in a position

1165
01:26:04,576 --> 01:26:08,620
to say what the other one does
or does not do with much authority.

1166

Oh, God!

1167
01:26:12,417 --> 01:26:14,751
You must think I'm such an idiot.

1168
01:26:14,836 --> 01:26:18,755
- No, Brian.
- No, I think I'm an idiot.

1169
01:26:18,798 --> 01:26:23,510
I mean, all these moments with you
I've been walking on a cloud,

1170
01:26:24,762 --> 01:26:27,890
it's just been the reflected glow
of you and Jake.

1171
01:26:27,932 --> 01:26:29,766
That's not true.

1172
01:26:30,435 --> 01:26:32,186
I'm so embarrassed.

1173
01:26:33,897 --> 01:26:38,859
God, talk about a bad case
of the third wheel!

1174
01:26:38,943 --> 01:26:44,031
- Brian!
- I feel like I'm on some bad TV show.

1175
01:26:44,282 --> 01:26:45,949
- Melrose Priest!
- No...

1176
01:26:46,868 --> 01:26:51,705
I don't get this. Why now?
Why tell me like this?

1177
01:26:51,915 --> 01:26:56,251
After months of lying, why call me
over tonight and cry to me?

1178
01:27:00,381 --> 01:27:02,716
He broke up with you, didn't he?

1179
01:27:06,012 --> 01:27:10,390
That moron broke up with you,
and you called your friend, the priest.

1180
01:27:10,475 --> 01:27:13,810
- I...
- It makes total sense, it's just...

1181
01:27:14,979 --> 01:27:17,731
Tonight, I really didn't want to be one.

1182

Rabbi Jacob Schram, and there he is.

- Brian, what's going on?
- Looking smart and breaking hearts.

- What are you doing?
- Don't smile at me.

- You're drunk.
- I'm not drunk.

- How? How do you think?

What did you expect?

1211

You said some things
to her that I resent.

You can't just write her off
like one of your dates, I won't let you.

1216

Brian, I'm in love with her! Okay?

1217
01:30:18,955 --> 01:30:22,624
I'm sorry you found out like this,
but the fact is,

1218
01:30:22,667 --> 01:30:25,168
that it's between me and her.

1219
01:30:25,211 --> 01:30:28,755
It was between you and her,
but now it's between you and me.

Why is it between you and me?

1221

- Because I love her.
- I know, I love her, too.

No... I'm in love with her.

- It came as quite a shock to her, too.

- You're in love with her?

Yes, thank you for adding
new depths to my confusion.

1228
01:31:02,373 --> 01:31:08,128
Damn it, Jake. You have a whole city
full of women at your feet.

1229
01:31:08,212 --> 01:31:13,300
Why go for the first woman
I've ever had any romantic feeling for?

1230
01:31:13,384 --> 01:31:16,011
Wait! Listen to what you're saying.

1231
01:31:16,053 --> 01:31:19,431
You're saying I should have
sensed the possibility

1232
01:31:19,515 --> 01:31:22,934
that a Catholic priest had a crush
on my secret girlfriend!

I care about her.

it would end this way.

I know? What does that mean?

1236
01:31:31,110 --> 01:31:34,779
Your casual relationships
with women never work,

1237
01:31:34,864 --> 01:31:40,452
because they always fall for you,
because you're smart, funny and cute.

1238
01:31:40,536 --> 01:31:44,915
- Don't put this all on me.
- You could've had a fling with anybody.

1239
01:31:44,999 --> 01:31:49,127
- Why'd you pull her into your bed?
- She pulled me into her bed!

I don't believe that.

1241
01:31:50,838 --> 01:31:53,673

not the Virgin Mary!

01:32:25,498 --> 01:32:29,709
Thank you. I want to thank you
for telling me this story.

1248
01:32:30,795 --> 01:32:33,964
- Why?
- Because now I can retire.

You have to give me advice.
That's what this is about.

I'm a half Punjabi Sikh,

my sister's married
a Jewish doctor from New Jersey,

1253
01:32:48,980 --> 01:32:52,816
and our grandmother was an Irish nun
who left me this bar,

1254
01:32:52,900 --> 01:32:54,985

may He turn their ankles,

01:36:13,267 --> 01:36:14,601
in the barn with Meggie.

1292
01:36:16,145 --> 01:36:18,855
I was so happy, I could die.

1293
01:36:20,900 --> 01:36:23,651
Did anything happen between you?

1294
01:36:23,944 --> 01:36:28,198
Not really. Flirtations, little moments.

1295
01:36:28,365 --> 01:36:32,744
Soon after, the Russians invaded
and I moved to the United States.

1296
01:36:38,709 --> 01:36:40,668
I'll tell you something.

1297
01:36:41,295 --> 01:36:45,548
If she had kissed me back,
I doubt I'd be sitting here right now.

1298
01:36:47,635 --> 01:36:49,385
I would have given it all up.

1299
01:36:51,597 --> 01:36:53,640
I mean, she didn't, but...

1300
01:36:54,475 --> 01:36:57,268
I keep thinking about
what you said in the seminary,

1301
01:36:57,353 --> 01:37:00,396
about how the life of a priest is hard,

1302
01:37:00,439 --> 01:37:05,568
and if you think you'd be happy
doing anything else, you should do it.

1303
01:37:08,197 --> 01:37:11,908
That was my recruitment pitch,
which is not bad when you're starting

1304
01:37:11,992 --> 01:37:14,953
because it makes you feel like a Marine.

1305
01:37:18,582 --> 01:37:24,963
The truth is, you can't tell yourself
there is only one thing you could be.

1306
01:37:25,047 --> 01:37:30,426
If you are a priest, or marry a woman,
it's the same challenge.

1307
01:37:32,054 --> 01:37:35,598
You cannot make a real commitment

1308
01:37:35,683 --> 01:37:39,102
unless you accept that it is a choice,

1309
01:37:40,229 --> 01:37:42,939
which you keep making
again and again.

1310
01:37:46,318 --> 01:37:52,240
I've been a priest over 40 years, and
I fell in love at least once a decade.

1311
01:37:54,535 --> 01:37:56,786
You won't tell me
what to do here, will you?

1312
01:37:57,872 --> 01:38:01,082
No. God will give you your answer.

1313
01:38:06,297 --> 01:38:10,049
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

1314
01:38:14,805 --> 01:38:17,307
- Hey.
- Hey.

1315
01:38:17,349 --> 01:38:19,017
How are you doing?

1316
01:38:22,605 --> 01:38:23,938
What's up?

1317
01:38:25,316 --> 01:38:30,737
- You're probably still mad at me...
- Probably? No, I'm definitely still mad.

1318
01:38:31,280 --> 01:38:34,991
Did you think you'd stroll over
and find me in a good mood?

1319
01:38:35,075 --> 01:38:37,577
No, I knew you'd still be mad at me.

1320
01:38:37,661 --> 01:38:41,331
What do you expect?
You should have just told me.

1321
01:38:41,832 --> 01:38:45,835
I'd have been jealous
and said it would muck things up,

1322
01:38:45,878 --> 01:38:48,004
but at least we'd still be friends.

1323
01:38:48,714 --> 01:38:51,341
We're still friends, I hope!

1324
01:38:51,425 --> 01:38:55,845
Friends don't lie to each other
and set each other up for humiliation.

1325
01:38:55,888 --> 01:39:00,725
That's why I'm here, I wanted
to apologize, if you'd let me talk!

1326
01:39:00,809 --> 01:39:04,354
I want to talk,
I've got things I want to vent.

1327
01:39:04,438 --> 01:39:07,357
Talk, vent, come on! Go ahead, vent!

1328
01:39:09,860 --> 01:39:11,069
Okay...

1329
01:39:14,031 --> 01:39:18,534
Now I lost my momentum.
Go ahead, what do you want to say?

1330
01:39:20,913 --> 01:39:24,540
I wanted to say that I handled
things badly, and I'm sorry.

1331
01:39:24,917 --> 01:39:27,126
You're my best friend.
Please forgive me.

1332
01:39:30,756 --> 01:39:33,716
- That was very simple and direct.
- Thank you.

1333
01:39:35,302 --> 01:39:39,681
You're lucky I am a priest.
Forgiveness comes with the job.

1334
01:39:40,140 --> 01:39:41,933
You're a good priest.

1335
01:39:47,398 --> 01:39:49,399
I got something for you.

1336
01:39:49,817 --> 01:39:54,195
I almost didn't because I was
so mad at you, but this was too good.

1337
01:39:55,531 --> 01:39:58,658
That's the Rabbi
Schlomo Schneerson card.

1338
01:39:58,784 --> 01:40:02,578
- It's the last of the series!
- You always talk about it.

1339
01:40:02,663 --> 01:40:06,749
- It's in such good condition.
- It's mint. I had to get it.

1340
01:40:08,002 --> 01:40:09,585
Brian!

1341
01:40:13,215 --> 01:40:14,549
Thank you.

1342
01:40:15,426 --> 01:40:16,926
You're welcome.

1343
01:40:21,098 --> 01:40:24,267
As pissed off as I was, the weird thing is

1344
01:40:24,309 --> 01:40:28,771
I'm very sorry I didn't get
to see you two together.

1345
01:40:28,856 --> 01:40:32,108
That would have made me happy,
in a weird way.

1346
01:40:32,234 --> 01:40:35,445
- Have you talked to her?
- No.

1347
01:40:35,529 --> 01:40:38,990
Things are really strange
between us now.

1348
01:40:40,909 --> 01:40:43,911
Are you guys working this out?

1349
01:40:43,954 --> 01:40:45,621
No, no.

1350
01:40:46,874 --> 01:40:50,418
But that's offset by the fact
that I'm about to lose my job.

1351
01:40:50,586 --> 01:40:52,170
Are you serious?

1352
01:40:53,297 --> 01:40:55,798
What a mess. I'm sorry.

1353
01:40:58,469 --> 01:41:01,554
I was starting to think
I had a few things figured out.

1354
01:41:01,638 --> 01:41:03,806
JAKE: Yeah. Me, too.

1355
01:41:04,391 --> 01:41:05,892
BRIAN: What happened?

1356
01:41:14,735 --> 01:41:15,777
Hi.

1357
01:41:16,987 --> 01:41:20,323
I don't think I'm the person
to offer objective advice

1358
01:41:20,365 --> 01:41:22,617
on this particular confession.

1359
01:41:23,702 --> 01:41:24,869
Brian!

1360
01:41:25,996 --> 01:41:27,163
Brian.

1361
01:41:29,833 --> 01:41:33,753
You don't have to say anything.
Just listen to me.

1362
01:41:33,837 --> 01:41:36,506
I'll just say one thing,
and then I will go away.

1363
01:41:38,592 --> 01:41:42,261
You're my friend,
and whatever else is going on,

1364
01:41:43,180 --> 01:41:48,684
I don't want you to think my feelings
for you relate to what I feel for Jake.

1365
01:41:48,769 --> 01:41:51,145
That's not the problem, and you know it.

1366
01:41:55,776 --> 01:41:57,819
I thought you wanted me

1367
01:41:59,571 --> 01:42:01,531
and that affected me.

1368
01:42:05,285 --> 01:42:08,371
Maybe that's not fair and
I'm reading all kinds of things wrong,

1369
01:42:08,455 --> 01:42:11,374
but it sure felt that way to me.

1371
01:42:19,466 --> 01:42:21,467
I don't know what to say.

1372
01:42:23,095 --> 01:42:29,559
I've just been having
so much fun, and...

1373
01:42:31,854 --> 01:42:34,564
I've had all of these feelings lately,

1374
01:42:34,648 --> 01:42:39,110
and not just my feelings for Jake,
but this...

1375
01:42:41,446 --> 01:42:45,616
Reconnecting with part of myself that
has been shut down for a long time.

1376
01:42:47,077 --> 01:42:50,121
If I indulged those feelings with you,

1377
01:42:50,205 --> 01:42:53,833
or if I took you for granted,
I am so sorry.

1378
01:42:55,502 --> 01:42:57,712
I can't bear that I hurt you.

1379
01:43:01,466 --> 01:43:06,262
It's not your fault.
I totally set myself up for this.

1380
01:43:08,265 --> 01:43:09,599
I'll tell you something,

1381
01:43:09,683 --> 01:43:12,768
I don't know which feels worse,
having my heart broken

1382
01:43:12,811 --> 01:43:16,189
or doubting myself,
because of what that means for me.

1383
01:43:16,273 --> 01:43:20,818
Don't you dare doubt yourself.
You have a gift, and you know it.

1384
01:43:21,528 --> 01:43:25,573
If you start doubting that because of me,
I don't know what I'd do to myself.

1385
01:43:26,408 --> 01:43:28,117
I don't doubt myself because of you.

1386
01:43:28,160 --> 01:43:32,622
I feel at my best when I'm around you,
and that makes me doubt everything.

1387
01:43:36,460 --> 01:43:39,921
I don't know what to do, Brian.
Tell me what to do, and I'll do it.

a little touchy-feely these days?

- A cell phone.

- Since when?
- Anna gave it to me. Look.

1396
01:44:34,393 --> 01:44:38,521
She put God on speed dial. I called it,
it's the Elvis Presley museum.

You know she's leaving next week?

- Yeah, yeah.
- Okay, I'm just checking.

- You guys have been talking?
- Yeah. We had a good talk.

- It's okay.
- Good.

1401
01:44:57,040 --> 01:45:00,501
- Good.
- Sure you don't want to talk about this?

1402
01:45:00,544 --> 01:45:04,505
I don't! Am I asking you
to talk about it? I don't want to.

1403
01:45:04,548 --> 01:45:07,008
- I'd talk about it if I wanted to.
- Okay.

1404
01:45:09,011 --> 01:45:12,930
- It's just that she's leaving...
- I know, what do you want me to do?

- A what?
- It's an "almost" stroke.

01:48:57,113 --> 01:49:00,741
- Yeah.
- Good. Good.

1453
01:49:00,784 --> 01:49:03,285
And you'll go out with a bang, huh?

1457
01:49:45,996 --> 01:49:52,418
Since Yom Kippur is the Super Bowl
of the Jewish calendar,

1458
01:49:52,502 --> 01:49:58,716
most rabbis try to cram
a whole year's worth of sermons

1459
01:49:58,800 --> 01:50:01,302
into one big, best-of sermon.

1460
01:50:02,095 --> 01:50:05,014
I'm not going to do that tonight.

1461
01:50:05,348 --> 01:50:08,267
I won't talk about the meaning of God

1462
01:50:09,394 --> 01:50:13,439
or the situation in Israel
or the status of Jews around the world.

1463
01:50:14,274 --> 01:50:16,400
I'd like to talk about
something more personal.

1464
01:50:17,861 --> 01:50:22,364
I'd like to talk about us,
the status of you and me.

1465
01:50:25,952 --> 01:50:31,206
A wise man once told me
that no rabbi can save anyone,

1466
01:50:32,500 --> 01:50:36,462
he can only offer himself
as a guide to other fearful people.

1467
01:50:39,299 --> 01:50:42,301
We live in a really complex world.

1468
01:50:42,385 --> 01:50:47,431
A world where boundaries and
definitions are blurring into each other

1469
01:50:47,515 --> 01:50:52,394
in ways that challenge us, not just
as Jews, but as human beings.

1470
01:50:54,439 --> 01:50:57,941
For a while now, you've let me
be your guide.

1471
01:50:58,401 --> 01:51:02,905
You've shared your lives with me,

1472
01:51:04,449 --> 01:51:07,034
you've explored your faith with me

1473
01:51:07,077 --> 01:51:12,414
in ways that, I know, sometimes have
seemed strange and even scary.

1474
01:51:13,667 --> 01:51:15,876
But you put your trust in me.

1475
01:51:16,711 --> 01:51:20,130
And, over the past few months,

1476
01:51:20,215 --> 01:51:22,591
I have been violating that trust.

1477
01:51:24,094 --> 01:51:27,846
I've been violating it
by not sharing my life with you.

1478
01:51:30,433 --> 01:51:33,644
For a number of months, I've been
seeing a woman who isn't Jewish.

1479
01:51:38,316 --> 01:51:42,653
It doesn't matter if I'm still with her,
or if I still love her, which I do.

1480
01:51:42,737 --> 01:51:47,366
What matters is that I shouldn't have
been afraid to discuss it with you.

1481
01:51:51,663 --> 01:51:53,872
I'm not sorry for loving her.

1482
01:51:56,000 --> 01:52:00,379
I am sorry, I'm very sorry,
that I put too little faith in you.

1483
01:52:06,136 --> 01:52:08,637
Yom Kippur is the day of atonement,

1484
01:52:10,932 --> 01:52:12,558
and so tonight,

1485
01:52:14,269 --> 01:52:18,689
I stand before you
and ask you to forgive me.

1486
01:52:38,084 --> 01:52:43,964
This could take a while. Go home.
I'll call when the board has decided.

1487
01:52:47,886 --> 01:52:50,220
Or you could stick around. Okay?

1488
01:53:15,538 --> 01:53:17,164
Come on. Come on!

1489
01:53:18,708 --> 01:53:20,709
- Yes? Yes!
- Yes!

1490
01:53:22,712 --> 01:53:24,463
Don't mess with me like that!

1491
01:53:28,384 --> 01:53:31,553
This is so fantastic. How does it feel?

1492
01:53:31,638 --> 01:53:33,180
It feels good.

1493
01:53:34,140 --> 01:53:37,893
We've got a lot to celebrate tonight,
barring an interfaith rumble!

1494
01:53:37,977 --> 01:53:41,647
- It's definitely Manischewitz time.
- We have two cases.

1495
01:53:41,731 --> 01:53:46,318
- Did you get the disks from Don?
- No, I'm going to, don't worry.

1496
01:53:47,070 --> 01:53:50,364
Not to rain on your parade,
but I had to say goodbye to Anna.

1497
01:53:51,407 --> 01:53:54,117
I know you don't want
to talk about it, but there it is.

1498
01:53:54,202 --> 01:53:56,703
There what is?
Come on, man, what are you doing?

1499
01:53:56,746 --> 01:53:58,831
What do you want me to do?
Flagellate myself?

1500
01:53:58,998 --> 01:54:01,959
Jews don't do that. We plant trees.

1501
01:54:02,043 --> 01:54:06,797
Who's talking about feeling guilty?
I thought you'd wanna do something.

1502
01:54:06,881 --> 01:54:11,134
You're on such a roll right now.
What's holding you back?

1503
01:54:11,928 --> 01:54:15,514
- You love her, don't you?
- Yes, I do, I just...

1504
01:54:16,850 --> 01:54:20,686
- Sometimes that's not enough.
- Listen to what you're saying!

1505
01:54:20,770 --> 01:54:24,982
Not enough? There's nothing else
that's worth anything against that.

1506
01:54:25,775 --> 01:54:30,904
For years you've talked about how
much you want something like this,

1507
01:54:30,947 --> 01:54:35,284
and when it comes, you walk away
over a few minor complications.

1508
01:54:36,286 --> 01:54:39,621
What kind of plan is that?
You know how God works.

1509
01:54:39,831 --> 01:54:45,335
Think He'll give you this a second
time 'cause you're on his crew?

1510
01:54:46,129 --> 01:54:47,796
Seriously, look at me.

1511
01:54:49,090 --> 01:54:52,467
As your friend, I'm telling you,
you're making this too complicated.

1512
01:54:53,344 --> 01:54:58,974
It's very simple. You love each other,
and she's leaving in two hours!

1513
01:54:59,809 --> 01:55:03,854
You need to ask yourself,
are you going to do anything or not?

1514
01:55:08,818 --> 01:55:10,193
Why are you standing here?

1515
01:55:10,820 --> 01:55:15,157
- You're right! Why am I standing here?
- The sign hasn't changed.

1516
01:55:16,117 --> 01:55:18,785
This is New York City!
Who waits for a sign?

1517

Cross the damn street!

1518
01:55:19,996 --> 01:55:23,290
Do we need signs to tell us
what to do? Cross the street!

1519
01:55:23,333 --> 01:55:26,293
- I gotta go!
- Go, yes, go!

This is very important to me.

Go and tell anybody
that Jake Schram is here, okay?

a break from this exciting life.

02:02:22,084 --> 02:02:23,752
(MUSIC RESUMES)

1613
02:02:36,349 --> 02:02:37,932
- Hello.
- Hello.

1614
02:02:41,729 --> 02:02:45,315
- Is three a crowd here?
- Not this three.

1615
02:02:47,818 --> 02:02:49,152
Hold it!

1616
02:03:06,379 --> 02:03:08,296
(SLOW SONG PLAYING)

1617
02:03:21,310 --> 02:03:23,103
Do you want to know

1618
02:03:23,771 --> 02:03:30,151
If everything glittering
will turn into the gold

1619
02:03:31,070 --> 02:03:36,533
I see in your hair?
I feel it could be there

1620
02:03:36,700 --> 02:03:41,454
Somehow tonight

1621
02:03:43,833 --> 02:03:46,251
And do you want to find

1622
02:03:46,502 --> 02:03:52,674
Something worth saving?
The change would do me right

1623
02:03:53,592 --> 02:03:58,596
'Cause I've been just waiting
and hesitating

1624
02:03:58,681 --> 02:04:02,642
With this heart

1625
02:04:02,685 --> 02:04:08,189
of mine

1626
02:04:12,778 --> 02:04:15,029
You're still a mystery

1627
02:04:15,364 --> 02:04:21,703
But there's something so easy
in how you're sweet to me

1628
02:04:22,663 --> 02:04:27,584
I feel completed
Like it's something I needed

1629
02:04:27,751 --> 02:04:30,128
For this heart

1630
02:04:31,797 --> 02:04:37,218
of mine

1631
02:04:42,266 --> 02:04:45,101
There's always something so tragic

1632
02:04:48,731 --> 02:04:52,484
About a hopeless romantic

1633
02:05:10,461 --> 02:05:12,587
So though we cannot know

1634
02:05:13,005 --> 02:05:19,427
If everything glittering
will turn into the gold

1635
02:05:20,262 --> 02:05:26,184
I'm through with waiting and hesitating

1636
02:05:26,685 --> 02:05:28,561
I want you taking

1637
02:05:28,938 --> 02:05:31,648
This heart

1638
02:05:33,025 --> 02:05:39,155
of mine

1639
02:05:42,284 --> 02:05:49,290
Heart of mine

1
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,600
Even then I had a bad feeling.

2
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:51,899
I felt like a grey mouse, heading
right for the mouth of a cat.

3
00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:54,999
And there was nothing...
nothing I could do about it

4
00:01:03,197 --> 00:01:05,997
Since my mother had died of
stomach cancer three years before,

5
00:01:06,497 --> 00:01:07,596
I was beginning to forget

6
00:01:07,896 --> 00:01:09,296
what she looked like.

7
00:01:13,096 --> 00:01:16,294
When I looked in her compact
and saw my own face,

8
00:01:18,094 --> 00:01:19,494
I could remember hers.

9
00:01:21,094 --> 00:01:22,394
The powder smelled
like when I kissed

10
00:01:22,694 --> 00:01:23,693
her cheek.

11
00:01:28,293 --> 00:01:29,393
My mother...

12
00:01:30,092 --> 00:01:31,392
she would never have
sent me to boarding

13
00:01:31,692 --> 00:01:32,391
school.

14
00:02:58,677 --> 00:03:01,577
It... it does get easier.
Really.

15
00:03:02,777 --> 00:03:04,776
Oh, no, I'm fine. Really.

16
00:03:06,776 --> 00:03:10,276
Listen, I'd like you
to meet someone fantastic.

17
00:03:10,776 --> 00:03:11,676
Victoria!

18
00:03:12,874 --> 00:03:14,974
-Victoria, come and meet Mary.
-Okay. Just a minute.

19
00:03:17,574 --> 00:03:19,674
The food is really gross though.
Totally hospital, right?

20
00:03:19,974 --> 00:03:23,673
So we mostly save our allowances
and like order pizza or Chinese.

21
00:03:24,173 --> 00:03:27,373
And well.. you know,
the anorexics just eat erasers.

22
00:03:28,972 --> 00:03:30,171
I'm serious.

23
00:03:35,271 --> 00:03:38,270
We can get away with anything
up here. I mean anything.

24
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:42,370
Wow! You're so out of shape!

25
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:45,570
Come jogging with us or you'll
have a stroke before you're twenty.

26
00:03:46,969 --> 00:03:49,469
So... this is the bathroom
and the showers.

27
00:03:50,469 --> 00:03:54,069
-What's your name again?
-Most people just call me "Mouse."

28
00:03:54,868 --> 00:03:58,167
-Mouse?
-My dad's always called me that.

29
00:03:58,867 --> 00:04:00,467
Really? How come?

30
00:04:02,667 --> 00:04:05,666
My dad used to call me "Princess."
Made me barf.

31
00:04:05,966 --> 00:04:06,866
Better than "Mouse."

32
00:04:10,666 --> 00:04:12,164
Mine's the messy one.

33
00:04:12,464 --> 00:04:14,264
Of course. Major Slobberina.

34
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:18,364
I can't help it. It's like rage
at my mother or something, right?

35
00:04:18,664 --> 00:04:21,463
And that's Paulie's.
This is mine. And...

36
00:04:23,363 --> 00:04:25,363
This one is yours.

37
00:04:29,661 --> 00:04:30,561
Sorry.

38
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:43,560
Hey...

39
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:45,459
Look, I know

40
00:04:45,659 --> 00:04:46,859
it's weird at first.

41
00:04:48,059 --> 00:04:49,959
But now, this is much more
home to me than home.

42
00:04:52,359 --> 00:04:54,358
Like the Lost Boys
in "Peter Pan," right?

43
00:04:54,658 --> 00:04:56,357
Except we're the Lost Girls, right?

44
00:04:56,857 --> 00:04:58,257
"Lost and Delirious."

45
00:05:02,056 --> 00:05:04,556
So when you're finished up here,
come party with us, okay?

46
00:06:22,843 --> 00:06:23,843
Want a smoke?

47
00:06:25,742 --> 00:06:27,041
Did I scare you?

48
00:06:29,541 --> 00:06:30,641
You got "New Girl"
written all over you,

49
00:06:30,941 --> 00:06:31,841
don't you?

50
00:06:32,541 --> 00:06:34,640
Like a fresh new lamb.
What are you? 13? 1 4?

51
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:36,540
Some kind of brainiac?
Skipped a few grades?

52
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:45,139
I'm Paulie... Oster.

53
00:06:48,739 --> 00:06:51,738
Mary Bedford.
Mouse really.

54
00:06:52,638 --> 00:06:53,637
They call me.

55
00:06:54,637 --> 00:06:56,637
I'd rather call you
"Shithead" than "Mouse."

56
00:06:59,337 --> 00:07:00,636
So you're rooming
with me and Tory, huh?

57
00:07:01,836 --> 00:07:03,836
Yeah. That's what Miss Vaughn said.

58
00:07:04,136 --> 00:07:06,436
Well, I guess she didn't like us
up there all by our lonesome.

59
00:07:11,634 --> 00:07:14,034
I've neve been
to a boarding school before.

60
00:07:15,434 --> 00:07:18,933
Well, now you're one of the
Lost Girls. Welcome to the club.

61
00:07:20,633 --> 00:07:21,333
Come on.

62
00:07:22,433 --> 00:07:23,832
Help me spike the punch.

63
00:07:25,231 --> 00:07:26,831
Let's get this party off its butt.

64
00:07:27,331 --> 00:07:28,631
Rage more.

65
00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:34,630
Rage more.

66
00:07:43,529 --> 00:07:45,829
Hey, girls.
Mind if we crash your tea party?

67
00:07:46,129 --> 00:07:48,729
Go away!
God, my brother is so annoying.

68
00:07:49,129 --> 00:07:50,628
He's cute, though.

69
00:07:51,028 --> 00:07:53,727
Hey, boys, can't you read the sign?
No dickheads allowed.

70
00:07:54,327 --> 00:07:55,527
Fuck, she's special, huh?

71
00:08:04,226 --> 00:08:05,526
And now I really want some tea.

72
00:08:06,126 --> 00:08:07,824
Yeah... Can a dickhead have some

73
00:08:08,024 --> 00:08:09,224
tea, please?

74
00:08:23,322 --> 00:08:24,821
You're my morning glory, Tory.

75
00:08:26,221 --> 00:08:27,721
Are you guys ready to party?

76
00:08:28,021 --> 00:08:29,121
Yeah!

77
00:09:01,116 --> 00:09:01,916
Paulie!

78
00:09:02,216 --> 00:09:03,616
Paulie, Paulie...

79
00:09:03,816 --> 00:09:04,516
What?

80
00:09:04,916 --> 00:09:07,014
I think young Paulie
just spiked the punch.

81
00:09:07,814 --> 00:09:09,414
Shall we pretend we don't know?

82
00:09:09,714 --> 00:09:11,914
I'd love to do that.
And I know you'd love that too.

83
00:09:13,614 --> 00:09:17,513
But that wouldn't be very good
"teachering," would it, Ms. Bannet?

84
00:09:25,011 --> 00:09:26,211
I can't do that.

85
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:35,410
Before that day, I never knew what
people meant when they said "fun."

86
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:38,410
I was like some kind of Dr. Spock.

87
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:41,809
"And what is this "fun"?"
I don't know.

88
00:09:43,509 --> 00:09:46,509
It was like she kind of put a spell
on me and all my foreboding,

89
00:09:46,809 --> 00:09:48,908
that feeling I had, just...

90
00:09:49,708 --> 00:09:51,107
kind of vanished.

91
00:09:54,807 --> 00:09:55,707
Hey, New Girl.

92
00:09:57,006 --> 00:09:58,106
What do you think of Vonny?

93
00:09:58,506 --> 00:10:00,406
Don't call her "New Girl."
It's so rude.

94
00:10:01,806 --> 00:10:04,106
Miss Vaughn? She's nice.

95
00:10:06,404 --> 00:10:08,504
Some of the girls say
rude things about her.

96
00:10:09,804 --> 00:10:11,204
She and Bannet...

97
00:10:11,404 --> 00:10:12,804
they got it going for sure.

98
00:10:14,003 --> 00:10:15,803
Paulie, give it a rest.

99
00:10:16,103 --> 00:10:19,103
She's just a single lady and they're
very good friends. And that's it.

100
00:10:19,902 --> 00:10:20,802
Don't be so mean.

101
00:10:21,002 --> 00:10:22,401
And homophobic.

102
00:10:22,701 --> 00:10:24,001
She seemed nice to me.

103
00:10:25,201 --> 00:10:26,301
I mean, um...

104
00:10:27,501 --> 00:10:29,501
normal. Well, not...

105
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:33,000
I'm not saying she's not nice,
New Girl. I'm saying she's a lezbo,

106
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:34,700
and she's got the hots

107
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,100
for Tory here.

108
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,699
Who can blame her, right?
Miss Beautiful.

109
00:10:45,599 --> 00:10:46,598
Sorry.

110
00:11:45,488 --> 00:11:46,488
I wasn't really sure

111
00:11:46,688 --> 00:11:48,287
what I had just seen.

112
00:11:49,287 --> 00:11:51,987
I know this sounds like naive,

113
00:11:52,387 --> 00:11:54,586
but at first...

114
00:11:55,186 --> 00:11:57,886
I thought they were like,
practicing for boys.

115
00:11:59,786 --> 00:12:04,084
In Rainy River, you see, nothing had
really changed since the fifties.

116
00:12:13,483 --> 00:12:14,983
It's morning time, you lazy sluts.

117
00:12:15,983 --> 00:12:19,081
-Out of bed or we kick your butts!
-Ally, get out of my face.

118
00:12:19,481 --> 00:12:20,181
I mean it.

119
00:12:22,181 --> 00:12:24,881
Mary, this is my sister Ally.
She's a moron, aren't you, Ally?

120
00:12:26,181 --> 00:12:27,281
And she has warts like all over

121
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,180
her toes! It's really gross.

122
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:32,480
-Get your gross toes out of my bed.
-Don't listen to her, Mary.

123
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:34,080
My toes are perfect.

124
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:37,179
Now get your fat
stinking butt out of here.

125
00:12:39,079 --> 00:12:40,379
Out, out, out!
Come back and I'm gonna

126
00:12:40,679 --> 00:12:42,579
whip your butt.
Fucking teenyboppers!

127
00:12:44,678 --> 00:12:46,777
Fucking grow up!

128
00:12:52,876 --> 00:12:55,176
Hey, I think there's
blueberry pancakes today.

129
00:12:56,176 --> 00:12:56,976
God.

130
00:13:14,073 --> 00:13:15,273
Wake up.

131
00:13:15,872 --> 00:13:18,471
-Mary. Laurie.
-Hi. How are you?

132
00:13:18,871 --> 00:13:19,671
Hi.

133
00:13:20,971 --> 00:13:22,871
Oh, this looks so amazing.

134
00:13:23,271 --> 00:13:25,771
I could totally give
my life for blueberry pancakes.

135
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:29,170
Don't you love
blueberry pancakes, Mouse?

136
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:30,070
Yeah.

137
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:31,770
Hey, hey, hey.
No bottom feeders!

138
00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:33,270
-Out!
-Get out!

139
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:34,070
Come on.

140
00:13:35,569 --> 00:13:37,969
Out! Out! Out!

141
00:13:54,066 --> 00:13:57,666
We want to define
the minimum value of the quadratic

142
00:13:59,166 --> 00:14:00,164
function.

143
00:14:00,364 --> 00:14:01,464
Now in order to do this, we must

144
00:14:01,864 --> 00:14:04,464
complete the square.
Since we know

145
00:14:04,764 --> 00:14:05,664
the leading coefficient is...

146
00:14:08,164 --> 00:14:09,263
We know, this, ladies.

147
00:14:09,963 --> 00:14:10,863
-Cordelia?
-One.

148
00:14:11,263 --> 00:14:12,263
One. Yes.

149
00:14:12,463 --> 00:14:13,563
Thank you.

150
00:14:13,963 --> 00:14:15,162
We simply add

151
00:14:15,962 --> 00:14:17,361
half

152
00:14:17,561 --> 00:14:20,361
of a linear term

153
00:14:22,261 --> 00:14:25,860
to "X" and square the result.

154
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:29,560
To get the constant term of 11...

155
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:33,060
Victoria?

156
00:14:35,759 --> 00:14:36,559
Yes?

157
00:14:36,759 --> 00:14:38,559
Come. Help me.

158
00:14:39,759 --> 00:14:40,659
You...

159
00:14:41,359 --> 00:14:42,958
want me to do the problem?

160
00:14:43,258 --> 00:14:45,257
Yes, I want you
to do the problem.

161
00:14:47,157 --> 00:14:49,057
Okay. I'll try.

162
00:15:03,854 --> 00:15:05,254
What seems to be the delay?

163
00:15:05,654 --> 00:15:06,554
Victoria?

164
00:15:07,553 --> 00:15:08,753
I don't get it.

165
00:15:11,053 --> 00:15:12,053
And what

166
00:15:12,353 --> 00:15:16,251
is it exactly
that you don't get?

167
00:15:19,451 --> 00:15:21,351
The... the "X". I mean like...

168
00:15:21,751 --> 00:15:24,750
Like where do you get the "X"?
I mean...

169
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:25,950
why?

170
00:15:26,950 --> 00:15:28,450
What is...

171
00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:30,750
what is an "X"?
Like...

172
00:15:33,849 --> 00:15:35,949
You don't get what the "X" is?

173
00:15:38,349 --> 00:15:39,749
Perhaps if you spent less

174
00:15:39,949 --> 00:15:42,548
time gabbing and a little
more time listening...

175
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:43,447
"Gabbing?"

176
00:15:45,947 --> 00:15:48,147
I consider that word
a punch in the face, Ms. Bannet.

177
00:15:48,947 --> 00:15:50,746
I beg your pardon, Pauline?

178
00:15:51,046 --> 00:15:53,446
It's a word males use
to shoot us down.

179
00:15:53,846 --> 00:15:55,346
To trivialize
our talking to each other.

180
00:15:55,646 --> 00:15:56,946
You want to be part
of that shit, huh?

181
00:15:58,944 --> 00:16:01,344
Pauline Oster, you will not

182
00:16:01,744 --> 00:16:03,044
use that kind of language

183
00:16:03,444 --> 00:16:04,544
in my class again.

184
00:16:04,944 --> 00:16:06,243
Do you hear me?

185
00:16:06,943 --> 00:16:08,243
Do you hear me?

186
00:16:08,943 --> 00:16:10,543
I have had it up to here...

187
00:16:11,043 --> 00:16:13,642
Up to my eyeballs
with your disrespect.

188
00:16:14,241 --> 00:16:17,641
-What do you think you're doing?
-Teaching. What you should've done.

189
00:16:18,041 --> 00:16:18,641
Paulie, please.

190
00:16:18,841 --> 00:16:20,741
-It's okay.
-Out of my classroom!

191
00:16:21,141 --> 00:16:23,140
You will go to Miss Vaughn's

192
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,940
and explain why you are not in my
class and suffer the consequences.

193
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:30,140
Do you hear me?

194
00:16:31,339 --> 00:16:33,639
Am I not clear?

195
00:16:36,939 --> 00:16:39,938
You have a nice day now, Eleanor.

196
00:16:52,036 --> 00:16:54,136
-So what's your next class?
-Reading.

197
00:16:54,436 --> 00:16:58,034
-Down the hall. On your right, okay?
-Yeah.

198
00:16:58,534 --> 00:17:00,134
you'll be fine.
Bye.

199
00:17:02,234 --> 00:17:06,833
That's it. You know you don't own
her. Victoria can speak for herself.

200
00:17:07,233 --> 00:17:08,333
Do you understand?

201
00:17:08,633 --> 00:17:10,033
-Do you understand?
-She wasn't thinking. She...

202
00:17:10,233 --> 00:17:11,832
She wasn't saying anything.

203
00:17:12,232 --> 00:17:14,431
-She was saying what she wanted to.
-She wasn't. She was just saying...

204
00:17:14,731 --> 00:17:16,031
It is her class.

205
00:17:16,331 --> 00:17:19,531
I will not have you terrorizing
my school. Do you hear?

206
00:18:11,022 --> 00:18:12,621
Who wants to hear the letter
to my blood mother?

207
00:18:12,921 --> 00:18:14,021
You wrote it?

208
00:18:16,021 --> 00:18:17,921
Did they actually
give you her address?

209
00:18:18,221 --> 00:18:20,920
No. But they said
they'd send it on to her.

210
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:24,620
And then if she's into it,
we can have like... a meeting.

211
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,020
I know.
That would be so

212
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:29,419
fucking...

213
00:18:35,019 --> 00:18:36,119
"Dear my real Mother,

214
00:18:38,418 --> 00:18:39,617
Don't be scared.

215
00:18:40,017 --> 00:18:41,817
It's totally okay
that you gave me up.

216
00:18:42,117 --> 00:18:44,117
You were only a kid,
I totally understand.

217
00:18:45,417 --> 00:18:48,416
Don't be scared of me.
I'm not scary.

218
00:18:50,516 --> 00:18:51,416
I know you had a hard life.

219
00:18:52,116 --> 00:18:53,516
And I have had a pretty good one.

220
00:18:54,214 --> 00:18:57,714
Comfortable, you know,
if a little chilly.

221
00:18:59,014 --> 00:19:02,713
Well, I imagine you living in some
apartment in Gerard and Parliament

222
00:19:03,113 --> 00:19:05,613
selling your ass for a living.
And I just thought

223
00:19:05,913 --> 00:19:08,413
I'd get in touch and we could
go for a beer sometime.

224
00:19:10,312 --> 00:19:11,711
Your loving daughter,

225
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:13,411
Paulie.

226
00:19:14,411 --> 00:19:15,511
P.S. Janet,

227
00:19:15,811 --> 00:19:19,410
my fake mother, she smiles without
her eyes and her hands are cold."

228
00:19:23,210 --> 00:19:24,910
I really hope she answers, P.

229
00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:29,509
When she's old, I'm gonna
carry her around on my back.

230
00:19:31,109 --> 00:19:32,609
You've never even met her?

231
00:19:34,709 --> 00:19:37,108
Children's Aid took me
away from her in hospital.

232
00:19:38,008 --> 00:19:39,607
She held me for one whole day.

233
00:19:40,407 --> 00:19:41,707
Every minute.

234
00:19:43,107 --> 00:19:44,406
That's what they told me.

235
00:19:46,306 --> 00:19:49,106
I never write to my mom.
We always like talk on the phone.

236
00:19:49,406 --> 00:19:52,106
Maybe that's why you
never say what you mean?

237
00:19:52,406 --> 00:19:54,004
I can't say what I mean, P.

238
00:19:55,104 --> 00:19:58,204
I mean, how could I ever
really say to her what I mean?

239
00:19:59,304 --> 00:20:00,504
Even in a letter.

240
00:20:02,103 --> 00:20:03,103
I mean like,

241
00:20:04,003 --> 00:20:05,303
"Dear Mommy, I hate you.

242
00:20:06,503 --> 00:20:10,501
The most recent reason being that
you went on about my teeth at Easter

243
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:12,701
in front of all your gross friends.

244
00:20:13,901 --> 00:20:15,201
You want me to be like...

245
00:20:15,501 --> 00:20:18,300
your perfect Junior League girl,
and grow up to do like

246
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:22,700
charity balls and be like the
concubine of some banker. Like you.

247
00:20:26,399 --> 00:20:27,899
But the truth of it is

248
00:20:29,699 --> 00:20:31,599
I am addicted to you.

249
00:20:33,299 --> 00:20:34,998
Like chocolate.

250
00:20:35,598 --> 00:20:38,397
I'm like I just always
want to be around you.

251
00:20:39,897 --> 00:20:42,197
I'm just like some stupid little
puppy, and you just keep kicking

252
00:20:42,497 --> 00:20:44,196
my teeth in with your words.

253
00:20:44,796 --> 00:20:45,996
No, your tone.

254
00:20:46,396 --> 00:20:47,696
And sometimes...

255
00:20:50,596 --> 00:20:51,594
I don't know...

256
00:20:51,894 --> 00:20:53,394
sometimes I wish you were dead."

257
00:20:55,894 --> 00:20:57,694
Rage more, Victoria.

258
00:20:58,994 --> 00:21:00,393
I can't believe I just said that.

259
00:21:07,292 --> 00:21:08,391
My stepmother's always talking

260
00:21:08,591 --> 00:21:10,191
about me when I'm there.

261
00:21:11,891 --> 00:21:12,791
I hate it.

262
00:21:14,691 --> 00:21:15,991
I hate her.

263
00:21:16,691 --> 00:21:17,790
I think she's jealous

264
00:21:18,090 --> 00:21:19,390
of my closeness to my dad.

265
00:21:20,090 --> 00:21:22,090
Tory's mom's
insanely jealous of her.

266
00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:25,289
Creeps me fuck out.

267
00:21:26,089 --> 00:21:28,089
Why would she be jealous of me?

268
00:21:29,789 --> 00:21:30,689
What?

269
00:21:35,687 --> 00:21:36,887
Hey, Mary.
You didn't do your letter yet?

270
00:21:46,086 --> 00:21:47,786
Oh. She died three years ago.

271
00:21:48,686 --> 00:21:49,686
I'm sorry.

272
00:21:50,484 --> 00:21:51,684
No, it's okay.

273
00:21:53,384 --> 00:21:55,384
I just don't see the point
of writing her a letter.

274
00:21:55,984 --> 00:21:57,284
Maybe she could hear you, you know?

275
00:21:59,383 --> 00:22:00,883
If I did write her a letter...

276
00:22:01,183 --> 00:22:01,983
Go for it.

277
00:22:05,882 --> 00:22:07,082
"Dear Mother,

278
00:22:09,381 --> 00:22:12,781
Remember you asked me
when you were sick...

279
00:22:14,781 --> 00:22:16,080
well, dying...?

280
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,180
It was fall.

281
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:21,280
October.

282
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:26,479
Still hot that year,
and your room

283
00:22:27,379 --> 00:22:29,879
it smelled like
sweet rotten apples.

284
00:22:35,677 --> 00:22:37,977
And I was holding
your head in my arms

285
00:22:40,577 --> 00:22:42,776
and your breathing was so fast

286
00:22:45,076 --> 00:22:47,276
and like shallow...

287
00:22:51,874 --> 00:22:53,274
You said, 'Mary,

288
00:22:54,174 --> 00:22:55,374
please

289
00:22:56,574 --> 00:22:57,973
remember me.'

290
00:23:00,873 --> 00:23:02,273
And the thing is

291
00:23:03,473 --> 00:23:06,571
I do sometimes forget
what you Iook like..."

292
00:23:14,071 --> 00:23:14,970
Brave.

293
00:23:17,170 --> 00:23:19,370
Do you really not remember
what she looked like?

294
00:23:22,770 --> 00:23:24,069
Sometimes.

295
00:23:26,269 --> 00:23:28,569
Oh, God, that is so incredibly sad.

296
00:23:30,269 --> 00:23:31,069
"Brave."

297
00:23:32,168 --> 00:23:34,567
That's your new name.
Mary B.

298
00:23:35,467 --> 00:23:36,867
"B" for "Brave."

299
00:23:39,666 --> 00:23:40,566
"Mouse" is dead.

300
00:23:41,366 --> 00:23:43,066
We're glad you're
our new roommate, Mary.

301
00:23:43,366 --> 00:23:44,766
Aren't we, Paulie?

302
00:23:45,166 --> 00:23:48,264
Duh. Are you glad to be our new
roommate, Mary Brave?

303
00:23:48,664 --> 00:23:50,364
Come on. Truth. Be honest.

304
00:25:30,848 --> 00:25:31,947
Excuse me.

305
00:25:34,147 --> 00:25:35,447
I was wondering...

306
00:25:36,547 --> 00:25:37,546
Would you?

307
00:25:37,846 --> 00:25:39,046
Could you?

308
00:25:39,646 --> 00:25:40,846
You like to garden?

309
00:25:41,046 --> 00:25:41,646
Yeah.

310
00:25:42,746 --> 00:25:44,646
Yes. I used to do it every day,

311
00:25:44,946 --> 00:25:46,544
like from April till it snowed

312
00:25:46,844 --> 00:25:48,044
with my mother.
Before

313
00:25:48,244 --> 00:25:49,244
she passed away.

314
00:25:51,544 --> 00:25:52,544
A couple of years ago.

315
00:25:54,343 --> 00:25:55,443
I'm sorry to hear that.

316
00:25:55,643 --> 00:25:59,043
So, I was wondering if maybe
you could use some help sometime?

317
00:25:59,443 --> 00:26:01,442
Or, if you'd rather not,
that's totally fine.

318
00:26:03,741 --> 00:26:06,541
No, no, no. That's okay.
It's uh... That'd be nice.

319
00:26:09,341 --> 00:26:11,740
It's uh... first time
in twenty years

320
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:13,640
that one of the girls offered.

321
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:17,240
It's sort of like a sign coming.
Dawning of a new age.

322
00:26:20,639 --> 00:26:21,839
Yeah, well...

323
00:26:22,139 --> 00:26:23,539
I was just kidding.

324
00:26:24,039 --> 00:26:25,239
I'll run it past Fay.

325
00:26:25,839 --> 00:26:26,839
I mean Miss Vaughn.

326
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:29,038
The head mistress.

327
00:26:29,538 --> 00:26:31,037
I'm sure she'll be okay with that.

328
00:26:34,037 --> 00:26:35,237
Hey, what's your name?

329
00:26:36,836 --> 00:26:37,836
Well, it's...

330
00:26:39,936 --> 00:26:41,236
it's in transition.

331
00:26:42,436 --> 00:26:43,936
In transition?

332
00:26:44,734 --> 00:26:45,834
I like that.

333
00:26:47,834 --> 00:26:48,634
So uh...

334
00:26:49,634 --> 00:26:51,934
how do you spell that?
Is that with a "ph" or an "f"?

335
00:26:56,933 --> 00:26:59,532
You're a... you're a bit
of a thinker, aren't you?

336
00:27:02,831 --> 00:27:03,731
I don't know.

337
00:27:04,331 --> 00:27:05,331
Well, you are.

338
00:27:07,431 --> 00:27:10,130
So, I'll be expecting you...
"in transition."

339
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:12,430
And get yourself some gloves.

340
00:27:20,329 --> 00:27:21,429
So...

341
00:27:26,029 --> 00:27:28,628
She's been planning
this trip to Italy all year.

342
00:27:29,027 --> 00:27:31,027
I just can't call
her up and be like,

343
00:27:31,327 --> 00:27:34,727
"Sorry, Mom, trip's off. I'm going
tree planting out west with Paulie."

344
00:27:38,626 --> 00:27:39,626
Tory...

345
00:27:44,424 --> 00:27:46,124
You know what I want to do.

346
00:27:47,024 --> 00:27:48,424
But I can't.

347
00:27:49,924 --> 00:27:52,423
She's been acting really
psycho lately, Paulie...

348
00:27:55,023 --> 00:27:56,723
And I don't know...

349
00:27:57,723 --> 00:27:59,622
I have to spend some time with her.

350
00:28:01,921 --> 00:28:04,721
Besides, you and me will be
together in the fall at McGill.

351
00:28:06,021 --> 00:28:08,021
We will be so together.

352
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:15,320
I'm going to plant 3000 trees a day.

353
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:18,219
And win a golden shovel for you.

354
00:30:05,701 --> 00:30:08,300
She gets serious nightmares.

355
00:30:30,997 --> 00:30:33,096
Shall we go easy
today for Mary Brave?

356
00:30:35,096 --> 00:30:36,996
You are gonna love it in here.
It's so cool.

357
00:30:39,096 --> 00:30:40,194
Are you okay?

358
00:30:40,594 --> 00:30:42,594
You should be able to speak easily.

359
00:30:43,994 --> 00:30:46,194
No pain, no gain, Mary Brave.

360
00:30:47,294 --> 00:30:50,493
You're doing good for your first
time out. Don't you think, Paulie?

361
00:30:50,993 --> 00:30:51,893
Not bad.

362
00:30:52,493 --> 00:30:54,792
I think we're doing
seven-and-half-minute miles.

363
00:30:55,692 --> 00:30:59,591
No way. Nine at the fastest.
We're dragging our butts, man.

364
00:31:03,491 --> 00:31:05,390
-Oh shit.
-Oh, God.

365
00:31:09,090 --> 00:31:10,490
It's so beautiful.

366
00:31:10,990 --> 00:31:12,090
Don't touch it if you
don't want to get bit.

367
00:31:12,390 --> 00:31:13,789
I wasn't gonna touch it.

368
00:31:14,389 --> 00:31:15,989
Just leave it to me. Okay.

369
00:31:17,389 --> 00:31:18,689
Okay, I'll take care of it.

370
00:31:23,188 --> 00:31:24,687
I said just leave it to me.

371
00:31:25,087 --> 00:31:26,687
I'll meet up with you later. Go.

372
00:31:28,187 --> 00:31:30,187
Come on. When she has
something in her head...

373
00:31:47,083 --> 00:31:48,183
Hey, there.

374
00:31:48,583 --> 00:31:49,383
Hi!

375
00:31:50,683 --> 00:31:53,682
One of you sexy ladies would like
to smoke a split with us?

376
00:31:55,182 --> 00:31:56,881
Uh... but thanks.
We're in training so...

377
00:31:57,181 --> 00:31:58,881
Hey, aren't you
Tim Moller's sister?

378
00:31:59,181 --> 00:32:01,481
-Yeah, I'm Tory.
-Hi.

379
00:32:01,781 --> 00:32:02,881
And this is Mary.

380
00:32:03,781 --> 00:32:06,480
Nice to meet you.
I'm Jake Hollander.

381
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:09,580
And uh, this is John.
And that idiot is Phil.

382
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:11,380
-Hi.
-Hi.

383
00:32:33,976 --> 00:32:35,276
So anyway um...

384
00:32:36,076 --> 00:32:37,674
-We gotta get going.
-Hey, Tory,

385
00:32:38,274 --> 00:32:40,774
isn't it Tim's 18th coming up?
down at the Bluenote?

386
00:32:41,074 --> 00:32:43,074
Yeah. Yeah, it is.

387
00:32:43,374 --> 00:32:45,374
Sounds like a good time.
You gonna be there?

388
00:32:47,473 --> 00:32:48,473
Um... maybe.

389
00:32:51,373 --> 00:32:52,572
Anyways, we gotta go.

390
00:32:52,872 --> 00:32:54,371
I hope to see you there, Tory.

391
00:32:55,471 --> 00:32:57,371
-"I hope to see you there, Tory."
-Shut up.

392
00:32:59,471 --> 00:33:02,471
-I think he likes you.
-Who?

393
00:33:02,770 --> 00:33:04,070
You know who.

394
00:33:05,070 --> 00:33:06,570
He liked my tits.

395
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:08,470
They all like my tits.

396
00:33:09,970 --> 00:33:11,969
-So you're gonna go?
-Where?

397
00:33:12,569 --> 00:33:14,569
To your brother's birthday party?

398
00:33:15,069 --> 00:33:18,569
And have all those gross guys
groping me? I'd rather stay home.

399
00:33:19,868 --> 00:33:21,867
I wonder what Paulie's
done with that bird.

400
00:33:23,067 --> 00:33:24,567
Paulie!

401
00:33:26,567 --> 00:33:28,266
Paulie!

402
00:34:28,056 --> 00:34:30,256
Oh, my God!
Is that for the bird?

403
00:34:30,656 --> 00:34:33,656
If they can see too much they get
freaked out. And they go psycho.

404
00:34:38,054 --> 00:34:42,154
-Do you think he's gonna fly again?
-I'm gonna take care of it.

405
00:34:44,353 --> 00:34:47,053
This is gonna be way, way cool.

406
00:34:53,251 --> 00:34:54,251
Come here.

407
00:35:04,950 --> 00:35:07,550
I would so totally
lose it without you, P.

408
00:35:28,046 --> 00:35:29,646
Don't worry.
I'm gonna protect you.

409
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:07,340
My mother, she really
liked to get her hands dirty.

410
00:36:08,139 --> 00:36:10,639
I'm always afraid
of like... worm eggs.

411
00:36:11,139 --> 00:36:12,339
Worm eggs?

412
00:36:13,339 --> 00:36:14,839
Do worms lay eggs?

413
00:36:15,939 --> 00:36:18,437
I think so.
Or no. I don't know.

414
00:36:20,837 --> 00:36:23,337
I don't think they lay eggs.
I think they just kind of...

415
00:36:24,137 --> 00:36:25,736
ooze up out of the earth.

416
00:36:27,436 --> 00:36:29,436
Your mother,
she sounds pretty interesting.

417
00:36:30,736 --> 00:36:32,834
I like a woman who doesn't
mind getting her hands dirty.

418
00:36:33,134 --> 00:36:36,734
Yeah. She would say, "Hey,
don't worry. It's a clean dirt."

419
00:36:38,434 --> 00:36:40,134
-She was funny.
-Yeah.

420
00:36:42,433 --> 00:36:45,333
Every year, in the spring,
she would wake me up in the morning

421
00:36:46,333 --> 00:36:49,731
and she would whisper in my ear
"The first crocus is here."

422
00:36:51,331 --> 00:36:54,131
And we would go outside
in our nightgowns and bare feet.

423
00:36:55,331 --> 00:36:56,831
And get your feet dirty. Together.

424
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:00,800
I don't know if they
didn't know I could hear.

425
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:03,599
Orjust pretended they didn't know.

426
00:40:04,899 --> 00:40:08,099
But after a while,
it was... kind of...

427
00:40:09,999 --> 00:40:11,598
I don't know, okay.

428
00:40:12,798 --> 00:40:14,997
Their sounds, their whispers...

429
00:40:16,097 --> 00:40:18,197
their shadows became kind of..

430
00:40:19,197 --> 00:40:22,096
well, just like part
of my dream or something.

431
00:40:23,396 --> 00:40:25,096
Just the way things were.

432
00:40:30,894 --> 00:40:32,594
It's morning time you lazy...

433
00:40:35,494 --> 00:40:36,593
-Holy fuck!
-Oh, my God!

434
00:40:41,393 --> 00:40:42,793
Bedford, shut the door.

435
00:40:46,791 --> 00:40:50,091
Look your...
your sister gets nightmares.

436
00:40:50,391 --> 00:40:51,391
She's like...

437
00:40:51,691 --> 00:40:53,490
She's like screaming in her sleep.

438
00:40:56,690 --> 00:40:57,590
Bedford...

439
00:40:59,390 --> 00:41:01,090
It isn't. It really
isn't what you think.

440
00:41:06,389 --> 00:41:07,389
Get out.

441
00:41:07,889 --> 00:41:10,788
-Get out of my bed.
-Relax. She'll get over it.

442
00:41:11,588 --> 00:41:14,387
You don't know Allison.
Okay, she'll go hysterical.

443
00:41:14,687 --> 00:41:16,587
She's gonna go
straight to Mom and Dad.

444
00:41:17,087 --> 00:41:17,987
So?

445
00:41:18,387 --> 00:41:20,886
Fuck it.
It's the 21st century, right?

446
00:41:22,586 --> 00:41:23,686
No, no.

447
00:41:24,286 --> 00:41:25,986
You don't understand.

448
00:41:27,284 --> 00:41:28,984
You just...
you don't understand.

449
00:41:37,583 --> 00:41:41,682
I swear to God. She crawled into
my bed. I didn't know she was there.

450
00:41:42,082 --> 00:41:43,582
She crawled into your bed?

451
00:41:46,181 --> 00:41:49,681
I think she has a crush on me.
I've told her I'm not like that.

452
00:41:50,081 --> 00:41:51,681
Tory, that's disgusting.

453
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:55,780
Why don't you tell somebody?
Tell Vaughn. Have her kicked out.

454
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:57,880
I feel sorry for her.

455
00:41:58,380 --> 00:41:59,780
Being adopted and everything.

456
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:02,279
Tory, you are too nice.

457
00:42:03,379 --> 00:42:05,879
So, you'll tell
your friends, right?

458
00:42:06,279 --> 00:42:07,779
you'll tell them the truth.
That I'm not like that.

459
00:42:07,979 --> 00:42:08,978
Of course.

460
00:42:09,778 --> 00:42:11,277
I can't believe
I ever thought you were!

461
00:42:11,977 --> 00:42:14,877
And Mom and Dad, you're not
gonna tell them anything, right?

462
00:42:15,877 --> 00:42:16,977
No, Tore.

463
00:42:17,776 --> 00:42:18,976
But are you sure you're not...?

464
00:42:19,376 --> 00:42:21,876
Ally! I love guys.

465
00:42:22,476 --> 00:42:24,376
I'm boy-crazy, if anything.

466
00:42:25,176 --> 00:42:28,974
Actually, there's this really cute
guy from RAB I met. Jake.

467
00:42:29,374 --> 00:42:31,074
And he is so totally
in love with me.

468
00:42:31,374 --> 00:42:33,274
Yeah? You gonna go out with him?

469
00:42:33,574 --> 00:42:37,073
Are you kidding? We're going to
Tim's party together. Friday.

470
00:42:38,073 --> 00:42:39,573
Allison? Come on.

471
00:42:40,772 --> 00:42:41,972
Don't worry, Tore.

472
00:42:42,272 --> 00:42:43,571
I'll straighten everything out.

473
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:57,860
Hey, Tory.

474
00:44:11,957 --> 00:44:13,657
So, how are you?

475
00:44:15,756 --> 00:44:16,956
Look, first of all,

476
00:44:17,156 --> 00:44:18,556
whatever they are
saying is trashtalk.

477
00:44:19,456 --> 00:44:20,356
Stupid.

478
00:44:22,956 --> 00:44:24,554
I know you guys won't listen to it.

479
00:44:24,854 --> 00:44:26,154
Of course not.

480
00:44:26,754 --> 00:44:29,354
But God, I mean, even if it was
true, I'd still be like, "So?

481
00:44:30,454 --> 00:44:31,454
Grow up."

482
00:44:31,654 --> 00:44:33,453
But it's not true.

483
00:44:33,753 --> 00:44:35,553
"I mean like my aunt is gay.
Like get over it."

484
00:44:35,853 --> 00:44:37,853
Yeah, but I'm not.
Totally, so...

485
00:44:38,252 --> 00:44:39,552
No, I know.

486
00:44:47,051 --> 00:44:48,451
She's upset.

487
00:44:49,650 --> 00:44:50,950
Give her time.

488
00:44:53,350 --> 00:44:55,450
Bedford, this is a dark day.

489
00:45:01,349 --> 00:45:02,549
""Darkling

490
00:45:03,149 --> 00:45:05,548
stand the varying
shores of the world.

491
00:45:05,848 --> 00:45:09,647
O, Anthony! Anthony! Anthony!"

492
00:45:12,947 --> 00:45:14,946
Ah... Her beloved is dying.

493
00:45:15,846 --> 00:45:17,046
You see?

494
00:45:17,246 --> 00:45:19,446
And so she calls upon the sun

495
00:45:20,246 --> 00:45:22,644
to burn the whole sphere,
the world, in fact. Hm?

496
00:45:24,844 --> 00:45:26,144
Her feeling is,

497
00:45:27,244 --> 00:45:28,644
how can nothing

498
00:45:28,944 --> 00:45:31,843
in nature change when such an
extraordinary shattering...?

499
00:45:32,243 --> 00:45:34,643
Listen to this.
A little later she goes,

500
00:45:35,143 --> 00:45:39,341
"Shall I abide in this dull world
which in thy absence

501
00:45:39,741 --> 00:45:41,641
is no better than a sty?"

502
00:45:42,841 --> 00:45:45,341
Sty. I like that.

503
00:45:46,441 --> 00:45:48,040
And a bit later, she says,

504
00:45:49,940 --> 00:45:52,540
"The crown of the earth doth melt.

505
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:54,140
And there is nothing left

506
00:45:54,340 --> 00:45:56,939
remarkable beneath
the visiting moon."

507
00:45:57,739 --> 00:45:59,239
"Nothing." I know that.

508
00:46:00,839 --> 00:46:02,139
Mm. Yes. Oh, yes.

509
00:46:03,439 --> 00:46:05,238
Eventually we all do, hm?

510
00:46:06,038 --> 00:46:09,337
You see what this is all about is

511
00:46:10,037 --> 00:46:11,137
love.

512
00:46:13,136 --> 00:46:16,236
Mad, passionate love

513
00:46:16,636 --> 00:46:19,236
that crosses all boundaries.

514
00:46:20,236 --> 00:46:21,734
And that's why we

515
00:46:22,034 --> 00:46:23,534
still relate to it today.

516
00:46:24,834 --> 00:46:28,134
Who among us has not felt passion?

517
00:46:28,434 --> 00:46:31,233
I know there are some
who would say that

518
00:46:31,733 --> 00:46:34,233
love is outmoded. Tired.

519
00:46:35,433 --> 00:46:37,032
Well, er... a social construct,

520
00:46:37,332 --> 00:46:38,531
if you like. Hm?

521
00:46:41,731 --> 00:46:44,231
What do you girls think?
Laurie?

522
00:46:45,931 --> 00:46:49,430
When my father left my mother for
his girlfriend, he said it was love.

523
00:46:50,330 --> 00:46:51,230
But it was obvious

524
00:46:51,530 --> 00:46:54,030
to everyone that it was well...

525
00:46:54,530 --> 00:46:55,429
sex.

526
00:46:56,729 --> 00:46:58,029
I think love is sex.

527
00:46:59,429 --> 00:47:01,729
I think it's like... projection.

528
00:47:02,329 --> 00:47:04,528
Like a mirage in the desert?

529
00:47:04,828 --> 00:47:06,727
You see what you want
in the person, you know?

530
00:47:07,327 --> 00:47:08,127
No, no, no.

531
00:47:08,427 --> 00:47:11,127
It's a chemical high induced by your
body so you'll want to make babies.

532
00:47:12,326 --> 00:47:13,026
It's money.

533
00:47:13,526 --> 00:47:14,126
Liar!

534
00:47:15,026 --> 00:47:17,026
Liar! Liar!

535
00:47:18,526 --> 00:47:23,424
You've all got your heads up
your assholes, because Love is.

536
00:47:23,824 --> 00:47:25,524
It just is. And nothing
you can say can make it go away

537
00:47:25,924 --> 00:47:28,024
because it is the point
of why we are here.

538
00:47:28,323 --> 00:47:29,323
It is the highest point

539
00:47:29,623 --> 00:47:30,923
and once you are up there,

540
00:47:31,123 --> 00:47:33,323
looking down on everyone else...

541
00:47:33,823 --> 00:47:35,322
you're there forever.

542
00:47:35,822 --> 00:47:37,521
Because if you'll move, right?

543
00:47:38,121 --> 00:47:39,421
you'll fall.

544
00:47:40,821 --> 00:47:42,021
you'll fall.

545
00:47:44,921 --> 00:47:46,020
Yes, Paulie.

546
00:47:48,620 --> 00:47:50,720
Hm... I think you may be right.

547
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:54,319
Listen, Mary,

548
00:47:55,219 --> 00:47:57,019
I have to talk
to you about Paulie...

549
00:48:00,319 --> 00:48:02,918
I know the whole thing must be
really weird for you and I'm sorry.

550
00:48:04,317 --> 00:48:08,017
But, like, you are
the only one that I can really...

551
00:48:11,016 --> 00:48:13,116
Look, you don't know my parents.
Okay.

552
00:48:13,916 --> 00:48:15,416
They are super super straight

553
00:48:15,616 --> 00:48:19,014
and super religious and they would
literally never speak to me again.

554
00:48:20,814 --> 00:48:24,514
And... I need them
to be a part of my life.

555
00:48:26,414 --> 00:48:28,513
I couldn't deal with losing them.

556
00:48:31,413 --> 00:48:33,113
I mean, I love Paulie.

557
00:48:34,112 --> 00:48:35,711
You know that I do.

558
00:48:36,911 --> 00:48:38,911
She's my best friend in the world

559
00:48:39,211 --> 00:48:42,011
and probably the only person
that I will ever love, like,

560
00:48:42,511 --> 00:48:44,710
like in the way
that Cleopatra loved.

561
00:48:47,810 --> 00:48:49,310
And to hurt her...

562
00:48:51,910 --> 00:48:53,909
feels like I'm choking, you know?

563
00:48:56,009 --> 00:48:58,209
Like I'm not in the breathing world.

564
00:49:00,709 --> 00:49:03,607
But like there's this life
that I'm supposed to live, okay?

565
00:49:03,907 --> 00:49:07,107
Like this dream my mother
and my father have for me...

566
00:49:07,607 --> 00:49:09,406
and even though
it is killing me,...

567
00:49:11,506 --> 00:49:13,406
even if it's killing me, Mary,

568
00:49:14,506 --> 00:49:17,306
I will never be the same
laughing-goofy Tory with her ever.

569
00:49:18,804 --> 00:49:22,204
I cannot be with her ever.
Not ever. Ever again.

570
00:49:27,503 --> 00:49:30,003
And the thing is, Mary,
it all depends on you now.

571
00:49:31,903 --> 00:49:32,802
I mean...

572
00:49:34,202 --> 00:49:37,701
Paulie is gonna...
take this very hard.

573
00:49:39,801 --> 00:49:41,101
Okay, she's really sensitive.

574
00:49:42,201 --> 00:49:43,300
And...

575
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:45,400
she's really gonna
need a loyal friend.

576
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:47,600
She's gonna need you

577
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:49,800
more than anyone
has ever needed you, Mary.

578
00:49:51,299 --> 00:49:52,299
You think you can handle it?

579
00:49:58,199 --> 00:50:00,098
What are you putting
that shit on for?

580
00:50:00,898 --> 00:50:01,897
Because.

581
00:50:02,797 --> 00:50:04,097
Because why?

582
00:50:04,997 --> 00:50:06,497
Because I'm going out.

583
00:50:07,397 --> 00:50:10,996
-Oh, where you going?
-Just out. With a friend.

584
00:50:11,396 --> 00:50:12,496
What friend?

585
00:50:12,996 --> 00:50:14,696
Just a friend of mine. OK?

586
00:50:15,496 --> 00:50:17,294
I'm just interested
to know, that's all.

587
00:50:18,494 --> 00:50:21,094
Well, yeah, friends should
respect each other's privacy.

588
00:50:23,994 --> 00:50:24,893
Friends?

589
00:50:26,693 --> 00:50:28,293
Yeah, friends.

590
00:50:29,393 --> 00:50:30,693
We're all friends here,
aren't we, Mary B.?

591
00:50:32,692 --> 00:50:34,291
We're not just friends.

592
00:50:38,491 --> 00:50:39,891
I'm sorry, Paulie.

593
00:50:52,989 --> 00:50:54,289
Are you okay?

594
00:50:56,089 --> 00:50:58,189
In her eyes,
that brightness, heh?

595
00:50:59,088 --> 00:51:00,887
Just like my fake mother...

596
00:51:02,587 --> 00:51:04,487
that brightness when she lies...

597
00:51:46,580 --> 00:51:48,480
Make you big and strong.

598
00:51:50,179 --> 00:51:52,079
You can fly far away from here.

599
00:52:07,576 --> 00:52:09,276
You can fly far away from here.

600
00:52:55,169 --> 00:52:57,068
We will fly away from here.

601
00:52:58,567 --> 00:53:00,667
We will away from here forever.

602
00:53:03,367 --> 00:53:04,267
Yeah,

603
00:53:04,966 --> 00:53:06,966
you're gonna fly far away from here.

604
00:53:37,261 --> 00:53:39,460
Until that night, I had never,

605
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:42,960
never had any feeling
down there at all.

606
00:53:44,060 --> 00:53:45,160
I was...

607
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:48,359
a kind of wooden doll
without blood in my body.

608
00:53:49,759 --> 00:53:51,059
But that night,

609
00:53:52,459 --> 00:53:55,958
that night, I started
to feel the blood moving.

610
00:54:41,750 --> 00:54:43,050
Did you have a good time?

611
00:54:45,250 --> 00:54:47,049
It's none of
your business, Paulie.

612
00:54:49,449 --> 00:54:50,749
You lied to me.

613
00:54:51,749 --> 00:54:54,048
I said I was going out with
a friend and that's what I did.

614
00:54:55,548 --> 00:54:58,147
Do you always fuck
your friends up against trees?

615
00:55:01,547 --> 00:55:05,446
My life is none of your business.
You have no right to spy on me.

616
00:55:05,946 --> 00:55:10,146
Everything you do is my business.
You are my business and I am yours.

617
00:55:11,144 --> 00:55:13,944
-If you spy on me again...
-What?

618
00:55:15,744 --> 00:55:17,044
Just don't.

619
00:55:21,543 --> 00:55:23,043
Are you gonna see him again?

620
00:55:36,040 --> 00:55:38,740
Listen, Paulie.

621
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:42,240
It's time we...

622
00:55:42,540 --> 00:55:43,740
we grew out of it.

623
00:55:45,839 --> 00:55:47,639
This is not right anymore.

624
00:55:49,739 --> 00:55:51,739
I just want to be friends, okay?

625
00:55:53,238 --> 00:55:55,037
This is not happening.

626
00:55:58,537 --> 00:55:59,537
Tory...

627
00:56:04,536 --> 00:56:06,036
Baby, please...

628
00:56:13,134 --> 00:56:14,334
Would you just please...

629
00:56:14,534 --> 00:56:17,034
-let me go?
-Is this about Allison?

630
00:56:17,534 --> 00:56:20,133
Your parents?
Please?

631
00:56:24,232 --> 00:56:25,432
Don't do this to me.

632
00:59:20,303 --> 00:59:21,602
What is that, Mary?

633
00:59:23,101 --> 00:59:24,201
Oh, just

634
00:59:25,401 --> 00:59:27,701
some seeds.
For, you know, the garden out there.

635
00:59:28,101 --> 00:59:29,001
Seeds?

636
00:59:29,601 --> 00:59:31,700
That's better than
what my mother gets me.

637
00:59:32,200 --> 00:59:34,700
It's like, oh, my God,
her taste is like so Ralph Lauren.

638
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:40,999
I hope you don't think
I'm like... butting in but...

639
00:59:42,699 --> 00:59:46,399
I thought you should know people
are saying like not very nice things

640
00:59:46,799 --> 00:59:48,798
-about you.
-Things?

641
00:59:49,098 --> 00:59:50,597
Oh, because of the way
you're hanging with Paulie.

642
00:59:51,697 --> 00:59:54,397
I guess they think that you're...
you must be like her.

643
00:59:55,397 --> 00:59:57,096
I mean everybody knows that
she practically raped my sister.

644
00:59:58,696 --> 01:00:00,496
Tory said that she crawled
into bed naked with her.

645
01:00:03,296 --> 01:00:04,894
Well, Paulie's my friend.

646
01:00:05,594 --> 01:00:07,994
So I guess it doesn't really
matter what other people think.

647
01:00:17,093 --> 01:00:18,393
-Hey!
-Hey.

648
01:00:23,791 --> 01:00:25,891
How much does it matter
what people think?

649
01:00:27,491 --> 01:00:29,591
I don't know. It depends
how you're paid, I guess.

650
01:00:31,290 --> 01:00:32,490
How much they're paying you?

651
01:00:36,690 --> 01:00:39,189
My father sent me some seeds.

652
01:00:40,089 --> 01:00:42,489
I was wondering if I could
plant them somewhere.

653
01:00:43,489 --> 01:00:44,389
Well...

654
01:00:45,589 --> 01:00:47,188
in the birch I should
leave you a spot.

655
01:00:50,687 --> 01:00:51,987
Let's see what you got.

656
01:00:58,886 --> 01:01:00,286
Whew! Worm eggs!

657
01:01:03,086 --> 01:01:06,384
Jake's hands are magic.
He knows exactly how to touch me.

658
01:01:06,784 --> 01:01:08,784
Teenage boys are so clumsy though.

659
01:01:08,984 --> 01:01:12,083
No. He's so perfect you wouldn't
believe it. He's like...

660
01:01:12,583 --> 01:01:13,683
like a sculptor.

661
01:01:15,183 --> 01:01:17,583
Roger... well Roger is no sculptor.

662
01:01:17,883 --> 01:01:20,681
More like a...
well, kind of like a plumber.

663
01:01:22,181 --> 01:01:23,281
Mine finishes as soon as

664
01:01:23,481 --> 01:01:27,681
-he's inside. The second.
-That's what you get with mating
with a 16 year old...

665
01:01:30,280 --> 01:01:31,280
Jake...

666
01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:32,780
Oh man...

667
01:01:32,980 --> 01:01:36,380
Jake could go all night.
He's a total man.

668
01:01:40,079 --> 01:01:41,579
Yeah, let's go. Come on.

669
01:02:28,470 --> 01:02:30,470
You wouldn't take it
lying down, would you?

670
01:02:30,870 --> 01:02:33,270
If some girl bird
broke up with you?

671
01:02:33,870 --> 01:02:37,069
You wouldn't just lie
there and squawk.

672
01:02:39,169 --> 01:02:43,769
You'd fly up to the highest branch
and swoop your lady love back again.

673
01:02:45,168 --> 01:02:46,467
You'd fly her away through the sky.

674
01:02:51,267 --> 01:02:53,366
You wouldn't just lie
there and take it...

675
01:02:55,466 --> 01:02:56,666
like a girl.

676
01:03:46,657 --> 01:03:47,657
Paulie?

677
01:03:51,856 --> 01:03:53,056
Pick up a shard.

678
01:03:54,956 --> 01:03:56,556
I said pick up a shard!

679
01:04:19,451 --> 01:04:21,551
Our blood runs together, right?

680
01:04:22,551 --> 01:04:23,851
Blood of the raptor.

681
01:04:27,150 --> 01:04:28,950
Now, cut off my hair.

682
01:04:30,050 --> 01:04:30,750
What for?

683
01:04:34,749 --> 01:04:35,849
Because I'm going to war.

684
01:04:37,749 --> 01:04:39,649
I got nothing to lose now.

685
01:04:40,149 --> 01:04:40,949
Paulie, this is crazy.

686
01:04:41,849 --> 01:04:42,948
Come on.

687
01:04:48,847 --> 01:04:51,246
Paulie... is this for Tory?

688
01:04:51,546 --> 01:04:53,646
Just cut off my hair!

689
01:04:56,446 --> 01:04:59,344
She wants a guy.
Not a girl with hacked hair.

690
01:05:00,344 --> 01:05:01,644
What do you know about it?

691
01:05:06,044 --> 01:05:07,144
I'm sorry.

692
01:05:08,443 --> 01:05:09,943
I'm... I'm sorry, okay?

693
01:05:10,843 --> 01:05:13,443
I just...
I just got to get her back.

694
01:05:18,141 --> 01:05:21,341
Paulie, listen to me.
Tory is not a lesbian.

695
01:05:21,741 --> 01:05:23,641
So you should just
forget about her, okay?

696
01:05:24,640 --> 01:05:25,740
Lesbian?

697
01:05:26,740 --> 01:05:29,840
Lesbian? Are you fucking kidding me?
You think I'm a lesbian?

698
01:05:31,340 --> 01:05:33,239
You're a girl in love
with a girl, aren't you?

699
01:05:34,239 --> 01:05:39,239
No! I'm Paulie in love with Tory.
Remember?

700
01:05:40,938 --> 01:05:45,637
And Tory is... she is
in love with me. Because

701
01:05:46,337 --> 01:05:49,536
she is mine and I am hers

702
01:05:49,936 --> 01:05:51,836
and neither of us are

703
01:05:52,136 --> 01:05:53,836
lesbians. God!

704
01:06:43,127 --> 01:06:44,627
"I will make me a willow

705
01:06:44,927 --> 01:06:48,926
cabin at your gate. And call
upon my soul within the house.

706
01:06:49,726 --> 01:06:50,926
I will write loyal

707
01:06:51,126 --> 01:06:53,226
cantons of condemned love

708
01:06:53,526 --> 01:06:57,024
and sing them loud
even in the dead of night.

709
01:06:57,524 --> 01:07:00,124
I will hallo your name
to the reverberate hills

710
01:07:00,424 --> 01:07:05,023
and make babbling gossip
of the air cry out 'Victoria!"'

711
01:07:05,823 --> 01:07:06,723
Paulie?

712
01:07:10,623 --> 01:07:12,222
Why don't you come down?

713
01:07:22,320 --> 01:07:24,220
Don't ever touch a raptor.

714
01:07:25,720 --> 01:07:26,720
Please.

715
01:08:02,514 --> 01:08:05,713
-I should have seen it come.
-I saw it coming. I told you.

716
01:08:06,113 --> 01:08:07,413
It's still coming.

717
01:08:57,404 --> 01:09:00,004
I bet he doesn't know how
to do what I can do for you.

718
01:09:00,904 --> 01:09:02,104
Paulie, please.

719
01:09:27,300 --> 01:09:29,199
No, Paulie.

720
01:09:31,299 --> 01:09:33,099
There'll be no more of this, okay?

721
01:09:36,698 --> 01:09:37,898
I love Jake.

722
01:09:51,196 --> 01:09:52,196
Paulie,

723
01:09:53,594 --> 01:09:56,694
listen to me. I'm going
to say this once and never...

724
01:09:57,494 --> 01:09:58,894
ever again.

725
01:10:04,893 --> 01:10:08,892
I will never love anybody
the way I love you, okay?

726
01:10:12,091 --> 01:10:12,991
Never.

727
01:10:14,491 --> 01:10:15,791
You know that

728
01:10:16,691 --> 01:10:17,991
and I know that.

729
01:10:19,890 --> 01:10:22,890
And I will die knowing that, okay?

730
01:10:26,889 --> 01:10:28,389
It just can never... it

731
01:10:29,589 --> 01:10:31,989
just can never ever forever be.

732
01:10:34,389 --> 01:10:35,688
Do you understand?

733
01:10:39,287 --> 01:10:40,487
It just can never...

734
01:10:41,787 --> 01:10:44,686
ever forever be.

735
01:11:30,879 --> 01:11:31,979
Hey, Mary!

736
01:11:35,778 --> 01:11:37,677
So what did you get
on that geography...

737
01:11:58,274 --> 01:12:00,673
Go ahead.
Laugh, it's okay.

738
01:12:01,673 --> 01:12:03,273
If you want to laugh, laugh.

739
01:12:04,673 --> 01:12:05,972
What's so funny?

740
01:12:10,871 --> 01:12:11,871
I know it.

741
01:12:13,471 --> 01:12:14,971
I'm funny.

742
01:12:17,270 --> 01:12:18,570
Paulie, that's enough.

743
01:12:19,470 --> 01:12:21,070
That's enough, Paulie.

744
01:12:21,870 --> 01:12:23,270
Paulie, please.

745
01:12:35,567 --> 01:12:38,067
Your parents are
very worried about you, Paulie.

746
01:12:38,467 --> 01:12:40,467
They say you don't
return their calls.

747
01:12:40,767 --> 01:12:42,366
I have no parents.

748
01:12:47,666 --> 01:12:48,666
I had...

749
01:12:49,964 --> 01:12:52,064
what used to be called
a nervous breakdown once.

750
01:12:54,364 --> 01:12:57,464
When I was a few years
older than you are. And uh...

751
01:13:00,963 --> 01:13:02,163
Someone got me help.

752
01:13:04,262 --> 01:13:07,461
And looking back, Paulie,
I am very glad they did.

753
01:13:07,761 --> 01:13:09,661
Because if they hadn't...

754
01:13:09,961 --> 01:13:12,061
Well, I don't know... it was

755
01:13:13,361 --> 01:13:16,260
like I was a car with no driver.

756
01:13:17,460 --> 01:13:20,760
Shall I abide in this dull world

757
01:13:21,760 --> 01:13:25,159
which in her absence
is no better than a sty?

758
01:13:34,157 --> 01:13:35,157
Hey!

759
01:13:39,157 --> 01:13:40,056
How's it going?

760
01:13:41,856 --> 01:13:42,756
Okay.

761
01:13:45,656 --> 01:13:47,356
Kind of weird actually.

762
01:13:48,156 --> 01:13:49,154
What's going on?

763
01:13:51,654 --> 01:13:53,454
You've ever known
somebody who changed?

764
01:13:55,254 --> 01:13:56,354
What kind of change?

765
01:13:58,253 --> 01:13:59,453
Like total.

766
01:14:00,653 --> 01:14:03,052
Like the change from
this to the winter freeze.

767
01:14:04,552 --> 01:14:05,451
Yeah.

768
01:14:06,851 --> 01:14:07,551
Yeah?

769
01:14:08,851 --> 01:14:12,551
Grass comes back every spring green
as ever. I guess people can too.

770
01:14:15,250 --> 01:14:17,450
Some people never
come back, though. Right?

771
01:14:18,650 --> 01:14:19,750
Yeah, some people.

772
01:14:22,549 --> 01:14:23,049
Listen, why don't you...?

773
01:14:23,249 --> 01:14:24,649
I have to go.

774
01:14:30,648 --> 01:14:32,148
You will not fall.

775
01:15:14,240 --> 01:15:16,140
""Come, you spirits

776
01:15:16,540 --> 01:15:18,840
that tend on mortal thoughts.

777
01:15:19,840 --> 01:15:22,539
Unsex me here!
And

778
01:15:23,039 --> 01:15:27,039
fill me from the crown to the toe

779
01:15:27,339 --> 01:15:30,038
full of the direst cruelty.

780
01:15:30,538 --> 01:15:32,437
Make thick my blood.

781
01:15:33,137 --> 01:15:36,037
Stop up the access
and passage to remorse

782
01:15:37,037 --> 01:15:40,736
that no compunctious visiting
of nature shake my

783
01:15:41,136 --> 01:15:42,436
fell purpose.

784
01:15:43,336 --> 01:15:45,036
Come to my

785
01:15:45,636 --> 01:15:47,634
woman's breasts and

786
01:15:48,034 --> 01:15:51,134
take my milk for gall, you

787
01:15:51,534 --> 01:15:53,134
murdering ministers, wherever

788
01:15:53,434 --> 01:15:55,333
in your sightless substances you

789
01:15:55,633 --> 01:15:58,833
wait on nature's mischief!
Come

790
01:15:59,233 --> 01:16:01,732
thick night, and

791
01:16:02,532 --> 01:16:04,831
pall thee in
the dunnest smoke of hell that

792
01:16:05,131 --> 01:16:07,531
my keen knife see

793
01:16:07,831 --> 01:16:10,131
not the wound it makes,

794
01:16:10,431 --> 01:16:11,630
nor Heaven

795
01:16:11,930 --> 01:16:13,930
peep through the blanket
of the dark to cry,

796
01:16:14,330 --> 01:16:15,430
'Hold, hold!"'

797
01:16:18,830 --> 01:16:20,829
Now, does anyone know

798
01:16:21,129 --> 01:16:23,729
what our friend Lady M. is on about?

799
01:16:24,729 --> 01:16:25,729
Cordelia?

800
01:16:31,827 --> 01:16:32,827
Vampires?

801
01:16:35,227 --> 01:16:37,326
Oh well, I've never
heard that interpretation.

802
01:16:37,626 --> 01:16:38,626
Oh, but that doesn't mean

803
01:16:38,926 --> 01:16:42,026
it's invalid, Cordelia.
Tell us more.

804
01:16:42,426 --> 01:16:44,924
Well, just... all the blood?

805
01:16:46,124 --> 01:16:47,124
Okay.

806
01:16:47,324 --> 01:16:50,324
Thinking about our lunch,
were we, Cordelia? Hm, again?

807
01:16:51,024 --> 01:16:51,624
Ah, Paulie?

808
01:16:52,924 --> 01:16:54,423
You looked like you
were involved with the piece.

809
01:16:56,023 --> 01:16:59,522
I was just thinking whether the Jays
would take the World Series again.

810
01:17:02,021 --> 01:17:04,921
I don't believe you, Paulie.
I saw you listening.

811
01:17:08,021 --> 01:17:10,020
You can go fuck yourself sideways.

812
01:17:24,119 --> 01:17:25,419
Paulie is going through

813
01:17:25,719 --> 01:17:27,318
a difficult time. Mm?

814
01:17:28,618 --> 01:17:30,917
Now, shall I offer up

815
01:17:31,217 --> 01:17:32,917
my interpretation?

816
01:17:33,217 --> 01:17:34,717
I think that Lady Macbeth...

817
01:17:35,017 --> 01:17:36,716
She wants to get up the guts.

818
01:17:38,516 --> 01:17:39,716
Yes, Mary.

819
01:17:41,516 --> 01:17:43,216
To do what she has to do.

820
01:17:44,914 --> 01:17:45,914
Only the girl

821
01:17:46,214 --> 01:17:48,014
part of her doesn't have the guts.

822
01:17:48,314 --> 01:17:50,314
So she says,
"Turn my milk to gall"

823
01:17:50,914 --> 01:17:52,313
and I think gall is poison.

824
01:17:55,113 --> 01:17:57,013
But then what
would happen to the baby?

825
01:17:57,513 --> 01:17:59,012
The baby would die.

826
01:18:00,811 --> 01:18:03,011
And she wants
not to care about that.

827
01:18:04,011 --> 01:18:06,711
She wants not to care,
to be like a guy,

828
01:18:07,311 --> 01:18:08,311
like a man.

829
01:18:10,010 --> 01:18:11,110
Men don't care, see?

830
01:18:13,210 --> 01:18:16,110
I liked what you said about the
Shakespeare. That scary speech.

831
01:18:16,510 --> 01:18:19,509
-You did?
-I wish I could be "unsexed"

832
01:18:19,809 --> 01:18:23,309
or whatever. I mean like it all just
causes so much trouble, you know?

833
01:18:30,307 --> 01:18:31,407
Ah, so see you later.

834
01:18:43,704 --> 01:18:44,704
Read it.

835
01:18:47,404 --> 01:18:49,404
-Out loud?
-Yeah. Right now.

836
01:19:00,301 --> 01:19:02,001
"Dear Miss Oster,

837
01:19:02,401 --> 01:19:05,301
After much difficulty, we have
located your birth mother but we are

838
01:19:06,101 --> 01:19:10,400
sorry to inform you that she does
not wish to be contacted by you..."

839
01:19:15,999 --> 01:19:17,599
Do you want me to keep reading?

840
01:19:31,897 --> 01:19:34,396
-Sorry, Paulie.
-Know what? She has a life.

841
01:19:37,296 --> 01:19:39,796
She has a right
to a fucking life, Mouse.

842
01:20:07,290 --> 01:20:09,190
You should have got
out of my way, man.

843
01:20:10,390 --> 01:20:12,490
I have been looking
everywhere for you.

844
01:20:12,890 --> 01:20:16,189
I'm sorry I said
"go fuck yourself" in class there.

845
01:20:16,789 --> 01:20:18,989
I was way out of line.
You can give me a detention.

846
01:20:21,689 --> 01:20:22,889
Give me two.

847
01:20:23,888 --> 01:20:26,487
I know someone, Paulie.
A friend

848
01:20:26,887 --> 01:20:28,387
of mine who could really help you.

849
01:20:28,587 --> 01:20:29,287
Help me what?

850
01:20:30,287 --> 01:20:31,287
Help you deal...

851
01:20:32,886 --> 01:20:37,486
I think people who lie to themselves
need help, Fay. Don't you?

852
01:20:37,886 --> 01:20:39,486
Oh, believe me, please.

853
01:20:40,184 --> 01:20:41,284
I know what you're going through.

854
01:20:41,684 --> 01:20:42,784
No, you don't.

855
01:20:43,984 --> 01:20:45,284
Love can be...

856
01:20:46,384 --> 01:20:48,583
a very painful experience.
I know.

857
01:20:48,883 --> 01:20:50,483
You don't know anything.

858
01:20:51,483 --> 01:20:54,583
Yes, Paulie. I think I know.

859
01:21:04,581 --> 01:21:07,080
She's the only person
who ever loved me, you know?

860
01:21:10,780 --> 01:21:12,480
I think I'll die without her.

861
01:21:25,977 --> 01:21:27,077
Hey, kid!

862
01:21:31,076 --> 01:21:34,576
-You know Jake Hollander?
-Yeah, I know him.

863
01:21:34,976 --> 01:21:36,976
Alright, give this to him
or I'll kick your butt.

864
01:21:43,474 --> 01:21:45,774
""Jake, you butthole.

865
01:21:46,574 --> 01:21:49,673
Saturday noon.
Dark noon foryou.

866
01:21:50,473 --> 01:21:51,973
Eastside Ravine.

867
01:21:52,373 --> 01:21:55,671
Duel to the death for the heart
of my queen, Victoria.

868
01:21:56,671 --> 01:21:59,571
Yours truly,
Paulie, the Raptor. ""

869
01:22:00,471 --> 01:22:03,071
No, the dinner's at six,
the tour is at five...

870
01:22:04,970 --> 01:22:06,070
Well, okay.

871
01:22:06,370 --> 01:22:09,970
Be here for the dinner. I don't want
to be the only one without a father.

872
01:22:12,769 --> 01:22:15,169
I don't know...
Chicken Kiev, lobster,

873
01:22:15,469 --> 01:22:17,069
everything, it's a buffet.

874
01:22:18,569 --> 01:22:21,568
Okay, so I'll see you on Friday.
Six o'clock sharp.

875
01:22:25,267 --> 01:22:26,867
Oh, yeah, I'm fine.

876
01:22:27,967 --> 01:22:29,067
Just...

877
01:22:31,366 --> 01:22:32,866
Maybe. I'll tell you
when I see you.

878
01:22:34,766 --> 01:22:35,866
Okay.

879
01:22:36,266 --> 01:22:37,166
Yeah.

880
01:22:38,064 --> 01:22:39,864
Love you. Bye.

881
01:22:49,363 --> 01:22:50,163
She's fucking fried, man.

882
01:22:51,063 --> 01:22:53,962
I think she sounds really unstable.
I don't think it's such a good idea.

883
01:22:55,161 --> 01:22:56,861
She's making Tory's life hell.

884
01:22:57,061 --> 01:22:59,661
-Why doesn't Tory just cut off?
-She's too nice.

885
01:23:00,161 --> 01:23:02,061
-That's who she is.
-Come on, man.

886
01:23:02,561 --> 01:23:05,160
Do it for Tory.
Do it for your woman.

887
01:23:06,360 --> 01:23:08,860
Why not?
A duel sounds like fun.

888
01:23:54,051 --> 01:23:56,451
He's never been on time
for anything in his life.

889
01:23:57,251 --> 01:24:00,151
He could be caught in traffic.
It gets really bad coming here.

890
01:24:00,851 --> 01:24:01,750
Yeah, for sure.

891
01:24:02,450 --> 01:24:04,650
Hello, Miss Bannet.
How are you?

892
01:24:05,050 --> 01:24:06,350
-Fine.
-Good.

893
01:24:06,650 --> 01:24:08,350
-What a wonderful party...
-Hey, hold on.

894
01:24:10,050 --> 01:24:12,149
Are you well? Yes? Good.

895
01:24:12,649 --> 01:24:14,549
-Oh, it's you.
-Miss Vaughn...

896
01:24:28,346 --> 01:24:31,046
-I wanna dance.
-Well, let's go then.

897
01:25:41,434 --> 01:25:42,633
Good evening, Victoria.

898
01:25:44,033 --> 01:25:44,933
Hello, Bruce.

899
01:25:45,133 --> 01:25:46,133
Good evening.

900
01:25:46,433 --> 01:25:48,133
Bruce, I wonder if I might cut in.

901
01:25:49,432 --> 01:25:51,231
This is a joke, right, Victoria?

902
01:25:51,731 --> 01:25:52,631
Joke?

903
01:25:53,431 --> 01:25:55,531
I'm asking you. Nicely.

904
01:25:57,231 --> 01:25:59,231
Can I dance
with your daughter, please?

905
01:26:00,030 --> 01:26:03,030
I'm afraid I don't think that's
appropriate or Victoria either.

906
01:26:07,929 --> 01:26:09,229
Are you crazy?

907
01:26:09,929 --> 01:26:11,729
What, don't you like dancing?

908
01:26:12,029 --> 01:26:14,329
You used to love to dance
with me on the roof. Remember?

909
01:26:14,629 --> 01:26:16,828
-Paulie, please.
-What?

910
01:26:17,428 --> 01:26:19,327
Don't make this difficult.

911
01:26:20,827 --> 01:26:22,327
You love me, Tory.

912
01:26:23,127 --> 01:26:24,227
Like a friend.

913
01:26:27,426 --> 01:26:29,026
As a lover.

914
01:26:30,026 --> 01:26:30,926
Say it.

915
01:26:33,724 --> 01:26:36,124
"I'm in love with you, Paulie."
Say it or I'll stop

916
01:26:36,524 --> 01:26:39,424
-this dance right now and...
-Paulie, please, please.

917
01:26:39,724 --> 01:26:41,024
Then say it!

918
01:26:43,223 --> 01:26:44,123
Say it.

919
01:26:51,821 --> 01:26:52,521
No.

920
01:26:53,421 --> 01:26:55,321
You tell anybody
whatever you want.

921
01:27:26,816 --> 01:27:27,816
Paulie.

922
01:27:28,116 --> 01:27:32,014
Paulie, come here.
Paulie, Paulie. Paulie...

923
01:27:37,114 --> 01:27:37,914
Fay.

924
01:28:18,007 --> 01:28:19,107
Mary Brave.

925
01:28:22,306 --> 01:28:23,206
Let's go.

926
01:28:34,404 --> 01:28:36,504
Have you ever been really thirsty?

927
01:28:36,804 --> 01:28:40,003
You open a carton ofmilk
and you pour it into your mouth.

928
01:28:41,503 --> 01:28:42,603
And it's...

929
01:28:43,403 --> 01:28:44,503
sour?

930
01:28:46,402 --> 01:28:48,801
That happened inside me...

931
01:28:49,101 --> 01:28:50,301
I'm so tired.

932
01:28:50,901 --> 01:28:51,801
...forever.

933
01:28:58,800 --> 01:29:00,700
I've never been so tired.

934
01:29:15,197 --> 01:29:16,697
He can fly.

935
01:29:17,497 --> 01:29:19,697
Hey, you taught him to fly?

936
01:29:20,897 --> 01:29:22,896
He's gonna show us
the way, Mary B.

937
01:29:24,296 --> 01:29:25,396
The way?

938
01:29:26,296 --> 01:29:28,296
Mouse, where is your father?

939
01:29:30,294 --> 01:29:31,994
Did I see you cry?

940
01:29:32,394 --> 01:29:36,294
Were you crying like a girl?
Like a girly, girly, girl?

941
01:29:48,191 --> 01:29:50,291
I've been crying too, Mary B.

942
01:29:52,291 --> 01:29:54,391
I've been crying
like a girly girl,

943
01:29:54,690 --> 01:29:57,490
sucky suck for weeks
now and it's time.

944
01:29:57,890 --> 01:30:00,090
It's time for the raptor.
Are you with me?

945
01:30:02,190 --> 01:30:04,189
I hate my father.

946
01:30:06,589 --> 01:30:11,089
Say it. It's easy. Come on.
"I hate my father."

947
01:30:17,687 --> 01:30:18,987
I hate...

948
01:30:21,086 --> 01:30:22,286
my father...

949
01:30:24,486 --> 01:30:25,386
Yeah.

950
01:30:25,986 --> 01:30:27,386
Give me more.

951
01:30:28,384 --> 01:30:31,184
I wish we were dead.
I hate him.

952
01:30:31,484 --> 01:30:34,784
I hate my stupid fucking
asshole-fucking father!

953
01:30:35,184 --> 01:30:36,484
I hate him!

954
01:30:36,783 --> 01:30:40,283
"Unsex me here
and take my milk for gall.

955
01:30:40,783 --> 01:30:44,282
Fill me from crown to toe
top full with direst cruelty..."

956
01:30:44,682 --> 01:30:47,481
Come on, say that.
Say it to the raptor. Come on.

957
01:30:48,681 --> 01:30:49,981
"Unsex me...

958
01:30:51,481 --> 01:30:54,780
unsex me here,
take my milk for gall..."

959
01:30:55,580 --> 01:30:58,380
"Make thick my blood."

960
01:30:59,180 --> 01:31:00,680
"Make thick my blood."

961
01:31:01,880 --> 01:31:03,279
Feed the raptor.

962
01:31:04,679 --> 01:31:07,079
-I can't.
-Oh yes, you can.

963
01:31:17,577 --> 01:31:20,576
"Fill me from crown
to toe top full

964
01:31:20,976 --> 01:31:22,776
with the direst cruelty."

965
01:31:23,276 --> 01:31:25,876
Come on. Say that
and feed the beast.

966
01:31:32,674 --> 01:31:35,873
"Fill me full from crown to toe top

967
01:31:36,673 --> 01:31:39,473
full with direst cruelty."

968
01:31:49,171 --> 01:31:50,771
Are you ready, Mary B.?

969
01:31:52,970 --> 01:31:54,870
You're ready for dark noon?

970
01:31:58,170 --> 01:31:59,470
I'm ready.

971
01:32:00,969 --> 01:32:02,569
Are you ready for anything?

972
01:32:05,169 --> 01:32:06,569
Rage more.

973
01:32:11,467 --> 01:32:12,467
Come on.

974
01:33:41,352 --> 01:33:42,651
She's ready!

975
01:33:43,651 --> 01:33:45,151
What the fuck is that?

976
01:33:45,551 --> 01:33:46,851
It's her pet budgie.

977
01:33:47,451 --> 01:33:49,251
-It's not a pet.
-Oh, no?

978
01:33:49,951 --> 01:33:50,950
It's a killer.

979
01:33:54,950 --> 01:33:56,450
Well, I came, Paulie.

980
01:33:56,950 --> 01:33:57,950
So what do you want to do?

981
01:33:58,250 --> 01:33:59,749
You want to fight me?

982
01:34:00,349 --> 01:34:01,649
You and your bird?

983
01:34:03,649 --> 01:34:05,749
I gotta warn you,
I'm on the wrestling team.

984
01:34:14,647 --> 01:34:15,646
Oh! Oh, I get it.

985
01:34:16,046 --> 01:34:17,546
Yeah, like a stage fight.

986
01:34:17,746 --> 01:34:20,246
We're gonna have a stage fight?
Oh, cool.

987
01:34:21,046 --> 01:34:24,544
Yeah, I played Laertes
in Hamlet last term.

988
01:34:26,544 --> 01:34:27,744
I'm gonna have fun doing this.

989
01:34:28,344 --> 01:34:29,344
Come on, Jake.

990
01:34:42,041 --> 01:34:43,041
Come on, Paulie.

991
01:34:45,641 --> 01:34:46,241
Come on, man.

992
01:34:49,840 --> 01:34:50,640
Be careful!

993
01:34:56,140 --> 01:34:57,739
Place your bets, my friends.

994
01:34:58,639 --> 01:34:59,539
For my love.

995
01:35:00,639 --> 01:35:02,339
Look, if you're talking
about Tory, get real.

996
01:35:02,739 --> 01:35:04,839
She hates you.
She's just too nice to tell you.

997
01:35:05,139 --> 01:35:07,238
-She loves me.
-Stop talking shit, Paulie.

998
01:35:07,737 --> 01:35:08,837
Victoria's my girlfriend.

999
01:35:13,437 --> 01:35:14,036
Watch out!

1000
01:35:15,236 --> 01:35:16,436
-Come on!
-Paulie, watch out!

1001
01:35:22,336 --> 01:35:22,834
Give her up!

1002
01:35:23,134 --> 01:35:23,834
Paulie!

1003
01:35:24,234 --> 01:35:25,034
Say it!

1004
01:35:25,434 --> 01:35:26,734
Say...

1005
01:35:27,034 --> 01:35:27,834
"I give her up."

1006
01:35:29,134 --> 01:35:30,434
Go fuck yourself.

1007
01:35:36,833 --> 01:35:37,432
Paulie, no!

1008
01:35:40,431 --> 01:35:42,131
-Fucking bitch!
-Paulie!

1009
01:35:42,931 --> 01:35:45,231
-She cut...!
-You fucking bitch!

1010
01:35:45,631 --> 01:35:48,230
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

1011
01:35:48,830 --> 01:35:50,130
You are fucking crazy!

1012
01:36:40,321 --> 01:36:41,421
Paulie!

1013
01:36:45,021 --> 01:36:46,021
Paulie.

1014
01:36:48,920 --> 01:36:49,920
Please.

1015
01:36:55,519 --> 01:36:58,019
"I will make me
a willow cabin at your gate,

1016
01:36:59,919 --> 01:37:02,819
and call upon my soul
within the house."

1017
01:37:07,417 --> 01:37:09,717
I rush into the secret house...

1018
01:37:14,216 --> 01:37:15,216
Paulie!

1019
01:37:51,210 --> 01:37:52,610
Dear my Mother,

1020
01:37:54,309 --> 01:37:56,309
I almost got lost too, didn't l?

1021
01:37:57,909 --> 01:38:00,409
But the pure love
you gave me till you died

1022
01:38:01,209 --> 01:38:04,008
was like a flame
always there, burning.

1023
01:38:05,607 --> 01:38:07,407
Andjust like the raptor

1024
01:38:08,107 --> 01:38:11,406
that little flame was all I needed
in order to see in the dark.

1025
01:38:13,406 --> 01:38:14,906
It saved me, mama.

1026
01:38:15,606 --> 01:38:17,306
From the deep dark.

1027
01:38:19,404 --> 01:38:21,704
Paulie, she didn't have that.

1028
01:38:22,504 --> 01:38:25,804
The darkness took over her
so she had to fly away.

1029
01:38:27,903 --> 01:38:30,103
I still dream of her.
Every night.

1030
01:38:31,903 --> 01:38:33,602
And I think I always will.

1031
01:38:35,302 --> 01:38:36,501
And you know?

1032
01:38:37,501 --> 01:38:39,601
I can always
remember your face now.

1033
01:38:41,101 --> 01:38:44,500
Anytime I think of you,
I look up and I can see your face,

1034
01:38:45,400 --> 01:38:46,800
my mother's face,

1035
01:38:48,300 --> 01:38:50,400
like a flame, across the sky.

You know, like at some companies they
don't allow employees to date each other?

happen at that party?

that I tore my dress

How about before that?

but that's hardly unusual

Wait a second You said that I could
lose it to someone else, right?

749
00:45:31,462 --> 00:45:34,192
So does that mean that
he took my luck from me?

750
00:45:34,298 --> 00:45:37,131
Maybe he needed it
more than you

As a matter of fact,
maybe I'm not even here right now

925
00:56:33,189 --> 00:56:36,056

01:14:00,803 --> 01:14:05,604
What can I say? I am a pathetic
disaster, and I give up

1208
01:14:05,707 --> 01:14:08,801
- You give up?
- I give up I don't care anymore

1209

What? I'm not a loser

1226
01:15:01,296 --> 01:15:03,025
That's cool
I'm a loser too

1227
01:15:03,131 --> 01:15:06,794
Anyway, it's just like a term of affection,
not a permanent condition

1228
01:15:06,902 --> 01:15:09,393
- Oh
- You just haven't had any good luck That's all

1229

I mean shoot
We don't have shoot

1238
01:15:32,361 --> 01:15:35,194
We don't have to tell Aunt Martha
about this, do we?

1239
01:15:35,297 --> 01:15:37,891
Don't stress it
I'll write you a kick-ass song

1240
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,730
Oh, so you're a... you're a songwriter now?
Very funny

1241
01:15:40,836 --> 01:15:42,736
- You could be more supportive

1301
01:19:42,611 --> 01:19:44,977
No Stop You were right
to blame it all on me

1302
01:19:45,080 --> 01:19:50,643
Then let me blame you for bringing this sweet,
wonderful, iron-tushed man into my life

1317
01:20:34,262 --> 01:20:36,230

1318
01:20:36,331 --> 01:20:38,265
- Hi
- Hi

1319
01:20:38,366 --> 01:20:40,698

and got two orders of everything

1322
01:20:47,843 --> 01:20:50,368
'cause I thought we could use
a little celebration

1323
01:20:50,478 --> 01:20:53,641

The band isn't
gonna do Maggie's song

01:20:58,320 --> 01:20:59,981
What? Why not?

1327
01:21:00,088 --> 01:21:02,579
Phillips is superstitious

1328
01:21:02,691 --> 01:21:04,420
- Come on
- He thinks that new groups

1329
01:21:04,526 --> 01:21:07,256
should only perform music
that they've written themselves

1330
01:21:07,362 --> 01:21:09,990
- That's crazy
- No It's just bad luck

1331
01:21:10,098 --> 01:21:13,397
Look I'm sorry this is happening
I didn't have anything to do with...

1332
01:21:13,501 --> 01:21:17,335
Ashley, stop It's not your fault
It's life Right?

That's great
What's the matter with that?

1526
01:32:57,638 --> 01:33:03,543
I don't know I mean, the feelings
I have generally lead toward kissing

1527
01:33:03,644 --> 01:33:06,238
So kiss him Kiss him!

I'm just saying if you are,
you might as well give up now

1546
01:34:11,579 --> 01:34:13,479
- Jake, please
- With your luck

1547
01:34:13,581 --> 01:34:16,778
there's gonna be an announcement
that due to some freak accident
all trains have been canceled

1548
01:34:16,884 --> 01:34:19,045
Then you're gonna go outside
and wait for the bus

perhaps even acid hail [Chuckles]

And it still is
Here I dare you not to win

1556

So you think meeting me
was unlucky?

Because I'll have you in my life

1565
01:35:11,172 --> 01:35:15,506

are a small price to pay

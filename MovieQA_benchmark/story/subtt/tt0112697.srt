Those are the scariest kinds of lawyers.

Even Lucy, our maid,
is terrified of him.

00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,640
And Daddy is so good,

32
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,240
he gets $500 an hour
to fight with people.

33
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:31,000
He fights with me for free.

00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,440
Daddy!

35
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:34,360
Cher, please don't start
with the juice again.

36
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,800
Daddy, you need your Vitamin C.

37
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,240
Where's my briefcase?

38
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,120
It's been a couple months now.
Let's go to Malibu.

39
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,560
Don't tell me those lowlifes

40
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,000
have been calling again.

41
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,440
They are your parents.

Don't sneak out of the office.

43

Dr. Lovett's giving you a flu shot.

Josh is coming for dinner.

45
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:50,720
Why?

46
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,000
He's your stepbrother!

47
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:54,440
You were hardly married to his mother.

48
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,480
Why do I have to see Josh?

49
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,760
You divorce wives, not children.

50
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,000
Here.

51
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,360
Forget it!

52
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:04,040
Did I show you
the loqued out Jeep Daddy got me?

53
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:06,440
It's got four-wheel drive,
dual side airbags,

54
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:07,880
and a monster sound system.

55
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,320
I don't have a license yet,

56
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,520
but I need something to learn on.

57
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:16,280
Boy! That came out of nowhere!

58
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,960
Here's where Dionne lives.

59
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,400
She's my friend

60
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:21,800
because we both know what it's like

61
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:24,000
to have people jealous of us.

62
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,120
- Girlfriend!
- I must give her snaps

63
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,040
for her courageous fashion efforts.

64
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,960
Hey, Cher.

65
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:33,320
Dionne and I were both named
after great singers of the past

66
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,440
who now do infomercials.

67
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,200
So?

68
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,320
Been shopping with Dr. Seuss?

69
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,680
I wouldn't skin a collie for a backpack.

70
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,480
It's faux.

71
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,440
Hello! That was a stop sign.

72
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,920
I totally paused.

73
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,320
Yeah. O.K.

74
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,760
It's not even 8:30,
and Murray is paging me.

75
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,320
He is so possessive.

76
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,280
This weekend he called me,

77
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,720
and he's all, Where were you today?

78
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,320
Dionne and her boyfriend Murray

79
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,520
are in this dramatic relationship.

80
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,720
I think they've seen
that lke and Tina Turner movie

81
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,880
just too many times.

82
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:08,280
Now, I have to say to her...

83
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:11,280
Why do you put up with it?
You could do better.

84
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,560
I know. Shh. Here he comes.

85
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,640
Woman, why don't you
be answering any of my pages?

86
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:18,760
I hate when you call me woman.

87
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,280
Where you been all weekend?

88
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,840
You jeepin' behind my back?

89
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,160
Jeepin'.

90
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:25,600
No! But speaking of vehicular sex,

91
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:28,480
perhaps you can explain
how this Kmart hair extension

92
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,400
got into the backseat of your car.

93
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:33,120
I don't know where that came from.

94
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,640
That looks like one of
your stringy something or anothers.

95
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:37,600
I do not wear polyester hair, O.K.?

96
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:39,640
Unlike Shawanna.

97
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:40,720
Dee, I'm Audi.

98
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,880
Bye.

99
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,720
That's it. I've had it with you.

100
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,920
Is it that time of the month again?

101
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,360
I don't know why

102
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,000
Dionne's going out
with a high school boy.

103
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,440
They're like dogs.

104
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,360
You have to clean them and feed them.

105
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,800
They're just like
these nervous creatures

106
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,720
that jump and slobber all over you.

107
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,640
Ew! Get off of me!

108
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,600
[Crash]

109
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,400
Oh, as if!

110
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:05,840
Should all oppressed people
be allowed refuge in America?

111
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,240
Amber will take the con position.

112
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,160
Cher will be pro.

113
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,080
Cher, two minutes.

114
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,480
So. O.K.

115
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,400
Like, right now, for example,

116
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:19,280
the Haiti-ans need to come to America.

117
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,720
Some people are all,

118
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,640
What about
the strain on our resources?

119
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,560
Like, when I had this garden party

120
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,160
for my father's birthday, right?

121
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,120
I said RSVP because
it was a sit-down dinner.

122
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,760
But people came that,
like, did not RSVP,

123
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,040
so I was, like, totally buggin'.

124
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,560
I had to haul ass to the kitchen,

125
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:39,040
redistribute the food,
squish in extra place settings.

126
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,880
By the end of the day,

127
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,720
it was, like, the more the merrier.

128
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,600
So if the government
could just get to the kitchen,

129
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,040
rearrange some things,

130
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,920
we could certainly
party with the Haiti-ans.

131
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,760
May I remind you
that it does not say RSVP

132
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,680
on the Statue of Liberty?

133
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,560
- Whoo!
- Yeah!

134
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,040
Thank you very much.

135
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,120
[Applause]

136
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,840
Amber, reply?

137
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:09,120
Mr. Hall, how can I answer that?

138
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,560
The topic is Haiti,

139
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,760
and she's talking about
some little party.

140
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,040
Hello! It was his 50th birthday.

141
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,280
Whatever.

142
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,720
If she doesn't do the assignment,
I can't do mine.

143
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,560
Ladies.

144
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:26,400
So, does anyone have
any further thoughts on Cher's oration?

145
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,840
Elton, comments?

146
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,760
Yeah, I can't find
my Cranberries CD.

147
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,680
I got to go to the quad
before somebody snags it.

148
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,600
I'm afraid I can't permit that.

149
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,960
Any further insights?

150
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,520
I have an insight, Mr. Hall.

151
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,840
I'm all ears.

152
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,760
O.K., like, the way I feel
about the Rolling Stones

153
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,600
is the way my kids are going
to feel about Nine Inch Nails,

154
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:47,200
so I really shouldn't torment
my mom anymore, huh?

155
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:51,120
Yes, well, it's a little
off the subject of Haiti,

156
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:53,920
but tolerance is always a good lesson.

157
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,560
Even when it comes out of nowhere.

158
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,480
And with that in mind,

159
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,880
I'm going to distribute
your report cards.

160
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:04,760
Now, is there
a Christian Stovitz in this class?

161
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,200
Mr. Hall, the buzz on Christian

162
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,120
is that his parents have joint custody.

163
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,040
He'll be spending
one semester in Chicago

164
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,480
and one semester here.

165
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:15,000
I think it is a travesty
of the legal profession.

166
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,960
Thank you for that perspective, Cher.

167

[Whimpering]

168
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:26,520
Could all conversations
please come to a halt?

169
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,640
And could the suicide attempts

170
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,040
please be postponed
till the next period?

171
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:39,240
Suddenly, a dark cloud
settled over first period.

172
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:41,920

Did you get your report card?

176
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:48,360
Yeah. I'm toast. How did you do?

177
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,360
I totally choked.

178
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,240
My father's going to
go ballistic on me.

179
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:53,160
Mr. Hall was way harsh.

180
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:55,560
He gave me a C-minus.

181
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:58,920
He gave me a C,
which drags down my entire average.

The columns date
all the way back to 1972.

186
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:09,000
Wasn't my mom a Betty?

187
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:11,880
She died when I was just a baby.

188
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:14,280
A fluke accident
during a routine liposuction.

189
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,720
I don't remember her,

190
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,720
but I like to pretend
she still watches over me.

191
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:21,720
Hey, Mom. 98 in Geometry.

Yuck! The maudlin music
of the university station?

00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:35,320
Yuck! What is it about
college and crybaby music?

Hey.

00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,720
Who's watching the Galleria?

198
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,640
The flannel shirt...
Is that a nod

199
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,560
to the crispy Seattle weather?

200
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:45,440
Or are you trying to stay warm
in front of the refrigerator?

201
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,840
Oh, wow, you're filling out there.

202
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:50,720
Oh, wow, your face is
catching up with your mouth.

203
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,640
I went by Dad's office.

204
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:55,040
He is not your dad.
Go torture a new family.

205
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,960
Just because my mother
marries someone else

206
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,400
doesn't mean he's my father.

207
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,000
That's exactly what it means.

208
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,200
I hope you're not
thinking of staying here.

209
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,680
I sure want to.

210
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,600
I got a place near school.

211
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,880
Shouldn't you go to school
on the East Coast?

212
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:10,840
I hear girls at NYU
aren't at all particular.

Hey!

You just got here, and already
you're playing couch commando.

216
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,920
In some parts of the universe,

217
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:26,000
it's considered cool to know
what's going on in the world.

218
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:29,560
I so need lessons
from you on how to be cool.

219
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,840
Tell me that part
about Kenny G. Again.

Josh, are you still growing?

00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,040
You look taller than you did at Easter.

223
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,480
I don't think so.

224

His head looks bigger.

225
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:47,280
So, Josh, have you given any thought

226
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,200
to our discussion about corporate law?

227
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:51,600
I think I'd like
to check out environmental law.

228
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,680
What for? You want to have
a miserable, frustrating life?

229
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,160
Josh will have that
no matter what he does.

230
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,040
He knows what he wants to do.

231

He's in a good college.

232
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,640
I'd like to see you
have some direction.

233
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,680
I have direction.

00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:05,840
Yeah. Towards the mall.

It's not ready yet.

237
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,520
What do you mean
it's not ready yet?

238
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:13,200
Some teachers were trying
to lowball me, Daddy.

239
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:15,600
You say never accept a first offer.

240
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,840
These grades are a jumping-off point

241
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,160
to start negotiations.

242
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,400
Very good.

No! Not the afternoon!

247
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,800
You are such a brownnoser.

248
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,960
You are such
a superficial space cadet.

249
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,360
What makes you think your teachers
will change your grades?

250
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,720
Only the fact that I've done it
every other semester.

251
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,560
I told my P.E. teacher

252
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,960
an evil male had broken my heart.

253
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,360
So she raised my C to a B.

254

They're horrible! Don't feel bad!

255
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,200
And they're all like this.

256
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:52,080
Then I promised Miss Geist

257

259
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:01,200
But Mr. Hall was totally rigid.

260
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:03,600
He said my debates
were unresearched, unstructured,

261
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,040
and unconvincing.

262
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,000
As if!

263
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:11,760
I felt impotent and out of control,

264
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,200
which I really hate.

265
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,120

266
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,520

I could gather my thoughts

267
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,040
and regain my strength.

268
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,000
What's wrong?

00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:28,480
Are you suffering from
buyer's remorse or something?

No. Nothing like that.

We've been shopping all day,

272
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,240
and I still don't know
what to do about Mr. Hall.

I've tried everything
to convince him

everyone else miserable, too.

Here's the 411 on Mr. Hall...

He's single, he's 47,

283

and he earns minor ducats
at a thankless job.

284

What that man needs
is a good, healthy boink fest.

Well, sure,
she has runs in her stockings,

359
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,520
I will. I'm going to
practice real hard.

360
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,120
O.K.

361
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:45,040
A licensed driver
with nothing to do?

362
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,920
Where would I find such a loser?

363
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,320
Granola breath, you got
something on your chin.

364
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,760
I'm growing a goatee.

365
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:54,160
You don't want
to be the last one

366
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,080
at the coffeehouse
without chin pubes.

367
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,000
I enjoy these little chats of ours,

368
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,920
but in the interest of saving time,

369
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,840
just tell me what you want.

370
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,760
O.K.

371
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:06,040
So, actually, I have a permit,

372
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:09,040
but Daddy says
I can't take the Jeep out

373
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,840
without a licensed driver.

374
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,560
Since you're not doing anything...

375
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:14,520
What are the chances
of you shutting up

376
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,160
till you get your way?

377
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,600
Slim to none.

378
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,880
Come on.

379
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,440
Hey, James Bond.

380
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:24,120
In America, we drive
on the right side of the road.

381
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,680
I am. You try driving in platforms.

382
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,640
I got to get back to school.

383
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,280
Want to practice parking?

384
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:33,080
What's the point?
Everywhere you go has valet.

385
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,360
What class you going to?

386
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,840
Actually, I'm going
to a Tree People meeting.

387
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:41,120
We might get Marky Mark
to plant a celebrity tree.

388
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,560
How fabulous.

389
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:44,960
Getting Marky Mark to take time

390
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,880
from his busy
pants-dropping schedule

391
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,320
to plant trees.

392
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,960
Why don't you hire a gardener?

393
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:53,120
Maybe Marky Mark
wants to use his popularity

394
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:55,880
for a good cause,
make a contribution.

395
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:58,760
In case you've
never heard of that,

396
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,320
a contribution is...

397
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,240
I have donated
many Italian outfits to Lucy.

398
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,640
As soon as I get my license,

399
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,560
I fully intend
to brake for animals,

400
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:08,480
and I have contributed many hours

401
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:11,360
to helping two lonely teachers
find romance.

402
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,720
Which I'll bet serves
your interests more than theirs.

403
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:16,600
If I ever saw you do anything
that wasn't 90% selfish,

404
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:18,040
I'd die of shock.

405
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:20,600
Oh, that would be
reason enough for me.

406
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,680
Would you call me selfish?

407
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,600
No. Not to your face.

408
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:30,040
Really?

409
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,960
Is Josh giving you shit

410
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,360
because he's in
his postadolescent idealistic phase?

411
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,760
Look, there's Mr. Hall.

412
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,720
Mr. Hall! Mr. Hall!

413
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:39,640
Um, do you drink coffee?

414
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,560
Not from this cafeteria.

415
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,960
Yes, under normal circumstances.

416
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,880
I am such a retard.

417
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,800
When I was packing Daddy's lunch,

418
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,720
I gave him my lemon Snapple

419
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,640
and took his sucky Italian roast.

420
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,560
Do you want it?

421
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,480
You sure you don't want it?

422
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:57,400
Tscha! It might stunt my growth.

423
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,840
I want to be 5'10
like Cindy Crawford.

424
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:01,240
But I thought you or Miss Geist
might like it.

425
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:03,160
Maybe you could share it.

426
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,600
Well... thanks.

427
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,040
Sure.

428
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:11,200
- Miss Geist!
- Miss Geist!

429
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,360
Did you sign up
for the environmental fair?

430
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,600
We will.

431
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:16,520
You have pretty eyes.
Don't hide them.

432
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,440
These clips are so cute.

433
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:20,360
And this tiny little waist.

434
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,800
Look. Wow.

435
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,280
Girls.

436
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:27,600
Oh, don't forget to sign up
for the environmental fair.

437
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:30,440
Not a total Betty,
but a vast improvement.

438
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:31,880
We did our best.

439
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:34,040
We got to book to P.E.

440
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,480
Come on, Dee.

441
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:37,160
I feel like bailing, dude.

442
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:40,040
I know what you mean,
but at least it's exercise.

443
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:42,440
I feel like such a heifer.

444
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,840
I had two bowls of Special K,

445
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:46,280
three pieces of turkey bacon,

446
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:47,720
five peanut butter M&M's,

447
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,160
and, like, three pieces of licorice.

448
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,360
Oh, my God. Look.

449
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:53,480
Is that a photo op or what?

450
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:55,400
Look at that body language...

451
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,800
Legs crossed towards each other.

452
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,760
That's an unequivocal sex invite.

453
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,560
Oh, Cher, he's getting her digits.

454
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,920
Look at Geist. She is so cute.

455
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,240
Ohh.

456
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:12,640

My report card?

474
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:18,840
The same semester?

475
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:20,280
Uh-huh.

476
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:22,680
What did you do?
Turn in extra credit?

477
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,120
No.

478
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,560
Take the midterms over?

479
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:27,000
Uh-uh.

480
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,920
You mean to tell me

481
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,280
that you argued your way
from a C-plus to an A-minus?

482
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:36,120
Totally based
on my powers of persuasion.

483
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,560
You proud?

484
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:41,920
I couldn't be happier
if they were based on real grades.

485
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,760
Fabulous.

486
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:51,000
I felt so satisfied,
I wanted to do more good deeds.

487
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:52,920
Ah-choo!

488
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,840
Dee, when your allergies act up,

489
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,600
take out your nose ring.

490
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:58,680
Follow through! There you go.

491
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:00,120
There you go.

492
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,520
All right, Cher!

493
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,800
Earth to Cher. Come in, Cher.

494
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,680
Ms. Stoeger...

495
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,600
I would just like to say

496
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:14,960
that physical education
in this school is a disgrace.

497
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:17,360
I mean, standing in line
for 40 minutes

498
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,800
is hardly aerobically effective.

499
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,720
I doubt I worked off the calories

500
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,360
in a stick of Carefree gum.

501
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:24,520
- Whoo!
- Whoo!

502
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,240
You exercised your mouth, Cher.

503
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,680
Hit the ball.

504
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,760
Ms. Stoeger,

505
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,960
that machine is just
a lawsuit waiting to happen.

506
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:35,440
Thanks for the legal advice.

507
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:38,160
Dionne, you're up.

508
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,400
I have a note from
my tennis instructor

509
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,800
saying I shouldn't expose myself
to any training

510
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,440
that might derail his teachings.

511
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:46,160
Fine.

512
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,440
Amber!

513
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:51,440
My plastic surgeon doesn't
want me doing any activity

514
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,840
where balls fly at my nose.

515
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,560
Well, there goes your social life.

516
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:58,640
[Man]
Ms. Stoeger...

517
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,560
got another one.

518
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:03,360
Ladies, we have
a new student with us.

519
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,880
This is Tai Frasier.

520
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:10,800
You could hit a few balls
in those clothes.

521
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:14,800
She could be a farmer
in those clothes.

522
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,760
Dee, my mission is clear.

523
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,680
Would you look at that girl?

524
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,600
She is so adorably clueless.

525
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,520
We've got to adopt her.

526
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:24,920
She is toe up.

527
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,400
Our stock would plummet.

528
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:30,080
Don't you want to use
your popularity for a good cause?

529
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,040
No.

530
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,920
Come here! Yeah, come here.

531
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,400
Hang with us.

532
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,800
Oh, thank you.

533
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,760
How do you like California?

534
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,360
Man, I'm freakin'.

535
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:42,480
I could really use some sort
of herbal refreshment.

536
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:44,640
We do lunch in 10 minutes.

537
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,520
We don't have any tea,
but we have Coke.

538
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,120
You guys got coke here?

539
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,560
Yeah. This is America.

540
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:54,240
So we decided to show Tai

541
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,200
the ropes at Bronson Alcott High School.

542
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:58,520
That is Alana's group over there.

543
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,240
They do the TV station.

544
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,320
They think that's the most
important thing on Earth.

545
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,080
And that's the Persian Mafia.

546
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:06,880
You can't hang with them
unless you own a BMW.

547
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,080
There's Elton in the white vest,

548
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,000
with all the most popular boys.

549
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:13,400
Including my boyfriend.
Ain't he cute?

550
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,800
If you decide
to date a high school boy,

551
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,240
they're the only acceptable ones.

552
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:19,160
Which one of them's your boyfriend?

553
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,600
As if!

554
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,520
Cher's got attitude
about high school boys.

555
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:23,960
It's a personal choice

556
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,360
every woman has got
to make for herself.

557
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,800
Woman, lend me $5.00.

558
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,200
Murray, I have asked you repeatedly

559
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,800
not to call me woman.

560
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:33,240
Excuse me, Miss Dionne,

561
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:36,440
street slang is an increasingly
valid form of expression.

562
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,840
Most feminine pronouns
do have mocking

563
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,640
but not necessarily
misogynistic undertone.

564
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:44,080
Wow. You guys talk like grownups.

565
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:46,760
Well, this is a really good school.

566
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:50,360
I'm going to go get a soda.
Do you guys want?

567
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,000
Sure.

568
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,400
She's nice.

569
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:55,280
Ooh! Project!

570
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:04,680
Oh, wow.

571
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:05,640
That's disgusting.

572
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:07,080

573
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:09,480

Thanks.

575
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:12,000
Those are really nice stickers.

576
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,760
I was thinking it was too cluttered.

577
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:16,680
I want to concentrate on

578
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:18,120
one main decorative statement,

579
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,120
like Marvin the Martian right there.

580
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:22,480
I can do Marvin the Martian.

581
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:23,480
Really?

582
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:26,240
I mean there's not
really a lot to him,

583
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,680
but you want to see?

584
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:30,160
Yeah.

585
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,040
That's really cool.

586
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:33,960
Thanks.

587
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:37,520
Wait. I got one here.

588
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,240
You didn't trace these?

589
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:40,680
Uh-uh. No.

590
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:42,520
Here's another one over here...

591
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:45,200
and lots of little guys.

592
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:46,920
That is so cute.

593
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,840
You're really good at it.

594
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:49,800
No.

595
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:51,240
No, really. You are.

596
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:52,680
Yeah.

597
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:54,520
Are you sure that's fat free?

598
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:55,960
Oh, yes.

599
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:58,360
And you lose weight
by cutting it small.

600
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:01,720
I met a really cool guy.

601

602
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:04,600
He's got long hair.

603
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:07,480
Straight off he offers me some smoke.

604
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:09,040
There he is!

605
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:12,760
Are you talking about drugs?

606
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:14,200
Yeah.

607
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:16,600
Tai, how old are you?

608
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:18,520
I'll be 16 in May.

609
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,440
My birthday's in April,
and as someone older,

610
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:22,360
can I please give you some advice?

611
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:25,240
It is one thing
to spark up a doobie at parties,

612
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:27,640
but it is another
to be fried all day.

613
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:29,080
Do you see the distinction?

614
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:31,240
Yeah.

615
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:33,560
Loadies generally hang
on the grassy knoll.

616
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:36,280
Sometimes they come to class
and say bonehead things,

617
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:37,840
and we all laugh, of course,

618
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:40,840
but no respectable girl
actually dates them.

619
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,520
You don't want to start off

620
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,240
on the wrong foot, do you?

621
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:45,680
I've got an idea.

622
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,320

Cher's main thrill
in life is a makeover.

626
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:56,880
It gives her a sense of control
in a chaotic world.

00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:02,160

01:05:08,440 --> 01:05:09,800
Um, where's Tai?

1623
01:05:09,880 --> 01:05:12,200
She met some random guys
at the Foot Locker

1624
01:05:12,280 --> 01:05:14,080
and escorted them right over there.

1625
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:15,560
Oh, my God! Did you...

1626
01:05:15,640 --> 01:05:17,400
I don't know where
she meets these Barneys.

1627
01:05:17,480 --> 01:05:18,840
I have a question, all right?

1628
01:05:18,920 --> 01:05:19,960
What?

1629
01:05:20,040 --> 01:05:21,240
The jacket...

1630
01:05:21,320 --> 01:05:24,120
Is it James Dean
or Jason Priestley?

1631
01:05:24,200 --> 01:05:25,560
Carpe diem, O.K.?

1632
01:05:25,640 --> 01:05:27,320
You looked hot in it.

1633
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:28,400
Really?

1634
01:05:28,480 --> 01:05:30,880
If I fall, would you guys catch me?

1635
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:33,240
Could they please be more generic?

1636
01:05:34,520 --> 01:05:36,680
Aah! Stop it!

1637
01:05:36,760 --> 01:05:37,680
Please!

1638
01:05:37,760 --> 01:05:39,360
Bring me back up!

1639
01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:40,720
Aah!

1640
01:05:40,760 --> 01:05:42,760
Aah!

1641
01:05:42,840 --> 01:05:45,240
Let me down!

1642
01:05:45,320 --> 01:05:46,680
Thank you.

1643
01:05:46,760 --> 01:05:47,640
You asshole!

1644
01:05:47,720 --> 01:05:49,560
Hey, man, we're just joking.

1645
01:05:49,640 --> 01:05:51,000
Oh, really?

1646
01:05:51,080 --> 01:05:52,640
Somebody could get killed.

1647
01:05:52,720 --> 01:05:56,320
Oh, my God.
Cher, you don't understand.

1648
01:05:56,400 --> 01:05:58,200
I was sitting there.
I was just talking to those guys.

1649
01:05:58,280 --> 01:06:00,600
All of a sudden,
we were laughing and...

1650
01:06:00,680 --> 01:06:01,720
Hey, you O.K.?

1651
01:06:01,800 --> 01:06:02,840
Y-yeah.

1652
01:06:02,920 --> 01:06:03,960
You sure?

1653
01:06:04,040 --> 01:06:05,080
I'm fine. Uh-huh.

1654
01:06:05,160 --> 01:06:07,320
Let's get you home for some R and R.

1655
01:06:07,400 --> 01:06:08,760
What's that?

1656
01:06:10,280 --> 01:06:12,600
Boy, considering
how clueless she was,

1657
01:06:12,680 --> 01:06:16,360
Tai certainly had
that damsel-in-distress act down.

1658
01:06:16,440 --> 01:06:17,800
Meanwhile, back at school,

1659
01:06:17,880 --> 01:06:19,240
everyone was talking about

1660
01:06:19,320 --> 01:06:21,680
Tai's brush with death at the mall.

1661
01:06:21,720 --> 01:06:25,040
Was it a montage of all the scenes
in your life?

1662
01:06:25,080 --> 01:06:26,800
Not exactly a montage.

1663
01:06:26,840 --> 01:06:30,320
Hey, Cher, is it true gang members
tried to shoot Tai?

1664
01:06:30,360 --> 01:06:31,440
No.

1665
01:06:31,480 --> 01:06:32,880
That's what everyone's saying.

1666
01:06:32,920 --> 01:06:34,160
Whatever.

1667
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,960
When I was 9,
I fell off this jungle gym.

1668
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,360
I swear I saw this...

1669
01:06:41,400 --> 01:06:43,280
Will you move down for Cher?

1670
01:06:43,320 --> 01:06:45,200
Tell me more. Tell me more.

1671
01:06:45,240 --> 01:06:46,640
Where was I?

1672
01:06:46,680 --> 01:06:49,040
You were thinking about
what was really important.

1673
01:06:49,080 --> 01:06:50,480
Oh, right, right.

1674
01:06:50,520 --> 01:06:51,920
Right before you die,

1675
01:06:51,960 --> 01:06:53,880
your mind just
sort of gets very clear.

1676
01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:56,240
It's a very intense spiritual thing.

1677
01:06:56,280 --> 01:06:58,640
I know when I was held
at gunpoint...

1678
01:06:58,680 --> 01:07:00,080
Excuse me. You were saying?

1679
01:07:00,120 --> 01:07:01,200
It's spiritual.

1680
01:07:01,240 --> 01:07:03,120
I can't pinpoint the spirituality.

1681
01:07:03,160 --> 01:07:06,560
If you've never
experienced anything...

1682
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:09,040
Tai, I was planning on going to Tower
and getting something for Christian.

1683
01:07:09,120 --> 01:07:10,320
Uh-huh.

1684
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:12,560
Like some kind
of present or something.

1685
01:07:12,640 --> 01:07:15,600
- You want to come?
- Sure. I owe him my life.

1686
01:07:15,680 --> 01:07:17,040
I'll get you after school.

1687
01:07:17,080 --> 01:07:18,160
Yeah.

1688
01:07:18,200 --> 01:07:20,880
Not today. I'm going
over to Melrose with Amber.

1689
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:22,600
We're going to Melrose.

1690
01:07:22,680 --> 01:07:25,960
Oh. Well, how about tomorrow?

1691
01:07:26,040 --> 01:07:28,800
Do you think we could
do it next Monday?

1692
01:07:28,880 --> 01:07:30,720
My week's filling up fast here.

1693
01:07:30,800 --> 01:07:33,960
When we got back
from the IHOP, it was 8:00.

1694
01:07:34,040 --> 01:07:35,400
Here comes your boyfriend.

1695
01:07:35,480 --> 01:07:37,920
Tai, check it out.

1696
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:39,360
- Ew!
- Ew!

1697
01:07:39,440 --> 01:07:41,760
Hey, could you shove down
a little bit?

1698
01:07:41,840 --> 01:07:43,200
No.

1699
01:07:43,280 --> 01:07:44,640
Don't the slackers prefer

1700
01:07:44,720 --> 01:07:46,560
that grassy knoll over there?

1701
01:07:53,360 --> 01:07:57,760
Tai, so anyway,
have you ever done it in water?

1702
01:07:57,840 --> 01:07:59,200
- Oh, yeah.
- Really?

1703
01:07:59,280 --> 01:08:02,080
What was happening?

1704
01:08:02,160 --> 01:08:04,920
Dionne asking Tai for sex advice?

1705
01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:08,360
Tai being the most popular girl
in the school?

1706
01:08:08,440 --> 01:08:11,160
It was like
some sort of alternate universe.

1707
01:08:12,560 --> 01:08:14,400
On top of everything else,

1708
01:08:14,480 --> 01:08:17,280
I was going to take the driving test,

1709
01:08:17,360 --> 01:08:20,480
so I had to find my most
responsible-looking ensemble.

1710
01:08:20,560 --> 01:08:25,000
Where's my white collarless shirt?

1711
01:08:25,080 --> 01:08:26,440
Lucy, where's my shirt?

1712
01:08:26,520 --> 01:08:27,880
Probably at the cleaner.

1713
01:08:27,960 --> 01:08:30,280
Oh, but today's the driving test.

1714
01:08:30,360 --> 01:08:32,680
It's my most capable-looking outfit.

1715
01:08:32,760 --> 01:08:34,560
O.K., I call them.

1716
01:08:34,640 --> 01:08:36,000
Oh, it's too late now.

1717
01:08:36,080 --> 01:08:38,880
Oh, we got another notice
from the fire department,

1718
01:08:38,960 --> 01:08:41,280
saying we have to
clear out the bush.

1719
01:08:41,360 --> 01:08:43,200
You said Jose would do it.

1720
01:08:43,280 --> 01:08:45,120
He your gardener. You tell him.

1721
01:08:45,200 --> 01:08:46,560
Lucy, I don't speak Mexican.

1722
01:08:46,640 --> 01:08:48,000
I not a Mexican!

1723
01:08:48,080 --> 01:08:49,920
Great. What was that all about?

1724
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:51,840
Lucy's from El Salvador.

1725
01:08:51,920 --> 01:08:53,240
So?

1726
01:08:53,280 --> 01:08:55,040
It's an entirely different country.

1727
01:08:55,120 --> 01:08:56,320
What does that matter?

1728
01:08:56,400 --> 01:08:59,240
You get upset if someone
thinks you live below Sunset.

1729
01:08:59,320 --> 01:09:00,800
So everything is all my fault.

1730
01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:02,080
I'm always wrong, right?

1731
01:09:02,160 --> 01:09:03,440
You're such a brat.

1732
01:09:03,480 --> 01:09:05,760
I had an overwhelming sense of ickyness.

1733
01:09:05,840 --> 01:09:07,640
Even though I apologized to Lucy,

1734
01:09:07,680 --> 01:09:09,560
something was still plaguing me.

1735
01:09:11,640 --> 01:09:13,960
Like Josh thinking
I was mean was making me postal.

1736
01:09:14,040 --> 01:09:16,480
Move into the right lane.

1737
01:09:16,560 --> 01:09:18,640
Anyway, why should I care
what Josh thinks?

1738
01:09:18,720 --> 01:09:20,960
Why was I letting it throw me
into such turmoil?

1739
01:09:21,040 --> 01:09:22,640
Watch out for the bike rid...

1740
01:09:22,720 --> 01:09:24,120
Oops! My bad.

1741
01:09:24,160 --> 01:09:25,920
What are you doing?

1742
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,320
You can't take up both lanes.

1743
01:09:28,400 --> 01:09:29,520
Get in the right lane.

1744
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:31,760
Not so...

1745
01:09:31,840 --> 01:09:34,000
Ooh! Should I write them a note?

1746
01:09:34,080 --> 01:09:37,920
Pull over up here
and turn off the engine.

1747
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:39,320
Right there.

1748
01:09:39,360 --> 01:09:41,440
Oh!

1749
01:09:41,520 --> 01:09:43,560
Are you going to take me somewhere

1750
01:09:43,640 --> 01:09:45,840
to make left-hand turns?

1751
01:09:45,880 --> 01:09:47,200
We're going back.

1752
01:09:47,280 --> 01:09:48,240
It's over?

1753
01:09:48,280 --> 01:09:50,080
It's over.

1754
01:09:50,160 --> 01:09:52,560
Well, how did I do?

1755
01:09:52,600 --> 01:09:55,600
How did you do?
Well, let's see, shall we?

1756
01:09:55,680 --> 01:09:58,040
You can't park,
you can't switch lanes,

1757
01:09:58,080 --> 01:09:59,760
you can't make
right-hand turns,

1758
01:09:59,840 --> 01:10:01,040
you've damaged private property,

1759
01:10:01,120 --> 01:10:02,520
and you almost killed someone.

1760
01:10:02,560 --> 01:10:04,720
Offhand, I'd say you failed.

1761
01:10:04,760 --> 01:10:06,120
Failed?

1762
01:10:06,200 --> 01:10:08,520
Well, can't we just start over?

1763
01:10:08,600 --> 01:10:10,920
I mean, I'm kind
of having a personal problem.

1764
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:12,840
My mind was somewhere else.

1765
01:10:12,920 --> 01:10:14,760
That biker came out of nowhere!

1766
01:10:14,840 --> 01:10:16,680
Oh! I swear I'll concentrate!

1767
01:10:16,760 --> 01:10:19,280
I drive really good, usually.

1768
01:10:19,320 --> 01:10:22,480
Isn't there somebody else
I can talk to?

1769
01:10:22,520 --> 01:10:24,840
You can't be
the absolute and final word

1770
01:10:24,920 --> 01:10:26,480
in driver's licenses.

1771
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:28,920
Girlie, as far
as you're concerned,

1772
01:10:28,960 --> 01:10:31,760
I'm the messiah of the DMV.

1773
01:10:31,800 --> 01:10:33,960
Now, get out of the car.

1774
01:10:47,480 --> 01:10:49,320
I can't believe I failed.

1775
01:10:49,400 --> 01:10:53,160
I failed something
I couldn't talk my way out of?

1776
01:10:56,720 --> 01:10:58,440
[Josh]
Go ahead, yeah.

1777
01:10:58,520 --> 01:11:00,360
Put your legs into me.

1778
01:11:00,440 --> 01:11:01,720
Hey, you're home.

1779
01:11:01,800 --> 01:11:04,560
How does it feel
to have a license?

1780
01:11:04,600 --> 01:11:07,240
I wouldn't know. I failed.

1781
01:11:07,320 --> 01:11:09,360
Oh. Bummer.

1782
01:11:09,440 --> 01:11:11,320
And, Josh, spare me your lectures

1783
01:11:11,400 --> 01:11:13,240
on how driving is
such a big responsibility

1784
01:11:13,320 --> 01:11:14,760
and you can't B.S.
your way through it.

1785
01:11:14,840 --> 01:11:16,880
I didn't say anything.

1786
01:11:16,960 --> 01:11:18,240
I know what you're thinking.

1787
01:11:25,240 --> 01:11:27,600
I got to tell you something.

1788
01:11:27,640 --> 01:11:29,560
I'm really sorry about your test.

1789
01:11:29,640 --> 01:11:31,480
I am so glad you're here.

1790
01:11:31,560 --> 01:11:33,400
There's something I got to do.

1791
01:11:33,480 --> 01:11:35,800
I need you here. Does this work?

1792
01:11:35,880 --> 01:11:37,720
Yeah. What is this stuff?

1793
01:11:37,800 --> 01:11:39,160
A bunch of junk

1794
01:11:39,240 --> 01:11:41,080
that reminded me of Elton.

1795
01:11:41,160 --> 01:11:44,440
I want to burn it
because I'm so over him.

1796
01:11:44,520 --> 01:11:45,880
What stuff?

1797
01:11:45,960 --> 01:11:49,240
Do you remember
when we were at the Val party

1798
01:11:49,320 --> 01:11:51,160
and the clog knocking me out

1799
01:11:51,240 --> 01:11:53,560
and Elton got a towel of ice?

1800
01:11:53,640 --> 01:11:55,960
I didn't tell you at the time,

1801
01:11:56,040 --> 01:11:58,360
but I took the towel as a souvenir.

1802
01:11:58,440 --> 01:11:59,760
You're kidding.

1803
01:11:59,800 --> 01:12:01,200
No.

1804
01:12:01,240 --> 01:12:02,560
And then...

1805
01:12:02,640 --> 01:12:05,160
remember that song
that was playing when we danced?

1806
01:12:05,240 --> 01:12:06,400
Remember that?

1807
01:12:06,480 --> 01:12:09,240
You know, Rollin' With The Homies.

1808
01:12:09,280 --> 01:12:11,280
Anyways, I got the tape, right?

1809
01:12:11,320 --> 01:12:14,080
I listened to it, like,
every single night.

1810
01:12:14,160 --> 01:12:16,080
Don't burn that, O.K.?

1811
01:12:16,120 --> 01:12:19,760
Tai, I'm really happy for you,

1812
01:12:19,800 --> 01:12:22,320
but what brought on
this surge of empowerment?

1813
01:12:22,360 --> 01:12:25,200
It's, like, I met this guy

1814
01:12:25,240 --> 01:12:26,640
who's so totally amazing

1815
01:12:26,680 --> 01:12:29,360
that he makes Elton
look like a loser.

1816
01:12:29,400 --> 01:12:31,280
That is so great.

1817
01:12:31,400 --> 01:12:34,120
Look, you've got to
help me get Josh.

1818
01:12:34,200 --> 01:12:36,480
Get Josh what?

1819
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:38,760
You know what I mean?

1820
01:12:38,840 --> 01:12:40,200
I like him.

1821
01:12:40,280 --> 01:12:42,560
Do you think
that he likes you?

1822
01:12:42,640 --> 01:12:43,520
Yeah.

1823
01:12:43,600 --> 01:12:44,960
How do you know?

1824
01:12:45,040 --> 01:12:46,880
Like, little things, you know?

1825
01:12:46,960 --> 01:12:49,200
Like, he always finds
some sort of way

1826
01:12:49,240 --> 01:12:51,440
to touch me or tickle me.

1827
01:12:51,480 --> 01:12:54,000
Do you remember
the time at the frat

1828
01:12:54,040 --> 01:12:55,920
when I was totally depressed?

1829
01:12:55,960 --> 01:12:58,600
We danced, and he was really flirty.

1830
01:12:58,680 --> 01:13:00,720
You O.K.?

1831
01:13:00,760 --> 01:13:04,480
Yeah. Oh, actually...
I was really bad today.

1832
01:13:04,560 --> 01:13:06,400
I had two mochaccinos.

1833
01:13:06,480 --> 01:13:07,840
I feel like ralphing.

1834
01:13:07,920 --> 01:13:10,240
I know exactly how that feels.

1835
01:13:10,320 --> 01:13:13,560
Like, the other day,
I was talking to Josh,

1836
01:13:13,600 --> 01:13:15,520
and we were discussing
the difference

1837
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:17,440
between high school girls
and college girls.

1838
01:13:17,520 --> 01:13:19,840
College girls wear less makeup.

1839
01:13:19,920 --> 01:13:21,840
That's why guys like them more.

1840
01:13:21,880 --> 01:13:25,600
But, Tai, do you really think
you'd be good with Josh?

1841
01:13:25,680 --> 01:13:28,520
I mean, he's, like,
a school nerd.

1842
01:13:28,600 --> 01:13:31,120
Am I some sort of
a mentally challenged airhead?

1843
01:13:31,160 --> 01:13:32,560
No! Not even!

1844
01:13:32,600 --> 01:13:34,920
I didn't say that.

1845
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,280
I'm not good enough
for Josh or something?

1846
01:13:37,360 --> 01:13:43,440
l... I just... don't think
you mesh well together.

1847
01:13:43,480 --> 01:13:45,960
You don't think
that we mesh well?

1848
01:13:46,040 --> 01:13:49,480
Why am I even listening to you
to begin with?

1849
01:13:49,560 --> 01:13:53,920
You're a virgin who can't drive.

1850
01:13:56,800 --> 01:14:00,000
Oh, that was way harsh, Tai.

1851
01:14:00,080 --> 01:14:02,960
All right. Look, I'm really sorry.

1852
01:14:03,040 --> 01:14:05,880
Let's just talk when
we've mellowed, all right?

1853
01:14:05,920 --> 01:14:07,320
I'm Audi.

1854
01:14:10,560 --> 01:14:12,560
What did I do?

1855
01:14:12,640 --> 01:14:15,480
I've created some sort of a monster.

1856
01:14:15,520 --> 01:14:20,280
I could feel the chunks
start to rise up in my throat.

1857
01:14:20,320 --> 01:14:22,600
I had to get out.

1858
01:14:24,440 --> 01:14:27,960
♪ When I was young ♪

1859
01:14:28,040 --> 01:14:31,880
♪ I never needed anyone ♪

1860
01:14:31,960 --> 01:14:35,240
Everything I think
and everything I do is wrong.

1861
01:14:35,320 --> 01:14:37,160
I was wrong about Elton.

1862
01:14:37,240 --> 01:14:38,520
I was wrong about Christian.

1863
01:14:38,560 --> 01:14:40,080
Now Josh hated me.

1864
01:14:40,160 --> 01:14:43,800
It all boiled down to
one inevitable conclusion...

1865
01:14:43,840 --> 01:14:46,200
I was just totally clueless.

1866
01:14:46,240 --> 01:14:49,080
Oh, and this Josh and Tai thing

1867
01:14:49,120 --> 01:14:51,000
was wiggin' me more than anything.

1868
01:14:51,040 --> 01:14:53,320
What was my problem? Tai is my pal.

1869
01:14:53,400 --> 01:14:55,240
I don't begrudge her a boyfriend.

1870
01:14:55,320 --> 01:14:56,680
I really... Ooh!

1871
01:14:56,760 --> 01:14:58,680
I wonder if they have that in my size.

1872
01:15:00,440 --> 01:15:02,920
What does she want with Josh anyway?

1873
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:04,360
He dresses funny.

1874
01:15:04,440 --> 01:15:06,280
He listens to complaint rock.

1875
01:15:06,360 --> 01:15:09,840
He's not even cute...
in a conventional way.

1876
01:15:09,880 --> 01:15:13,920
I mean, he's just like this slug

1877
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,480
who hangs around
the house all the time.

1878
01:15:16,560 --> 01:15:20,000
And he's a hideous dancer.

1879
01:15:20,080 --> 01:15:22,840
Couldn't take him anywhere.

1880
01:15:22,880 --> 01:15:25,720
Wait a second.
What am I stressing about?

1881
01:15:25,760 --> 01:15:27,640
This is, like, Josh.

1882
01:15:27,680 --> 01:15:31,560
♪ All by myself? ♪

1883
01:15:31,640 --> 01:15:34,440
O.K., O.K.,
so he's kind of a Baldwin.

1884
01:15:34,520 --> 01:15:36,840
What would he want with Tai?

1885
01:15:36,920 --> 01:15:38,760
She couldn't make him happy.

1886
01:15:38,840 --> 01:15:40,680
Josh needs someone with imagination,

1887
01:15:40,760 --> 01:15:43,080
someone to take care of him,

1888
01:15:43,160 --> 01:15:45,480
someone to laugh at his jokes...

1889
01:15:45,560 --> 01:15:47,880
in case he ever makes any.

1890
01:15:47,960 --> 01:15:49,400
Then suddenly...

1891
01:15:49,480 --> 01:15:51,480
Oh, my God.

1892
01:15:53,320 --> 01:15:56,240
I love Josh.

1893
01:15:56,320 --> 01:16:00,960
I am majorly, totally,
crazy in love with Josh.

1894
01:16:01,040 --> 01:16:04,280
But now I don't know
how to act around him.

1895
01:16:04,360 --> 01:16:06,680
I mean, ordinarily,
I'd strut around him

1896
01:16:06,760 --> 01:16:08,120
in my cutest little outfits

1897
01:16:08,200 --> 01:16:10,040
and send myself flowers and candy,

1898
01:16:10,120 --> 01:16:12,920
but I couldn't do that stuff with Josh.

1899
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:14,360
What's with you?

1900
01:16:14,440 --> 01:16:15,800
What do you mean?

1901
01:16:15,880 --> 01:16:17,240
You're so quiet.

1902
01:16:17,320 --> 01:16:19,640
You haven't made me
watch The Real World.

1903
01:16:19,720 --> 01:16:21,560
I care about the news.

1904
01:16:21,640 --> 01:16:22,680
Since when?

1905
01:16:22,760 --> 01:16:24,720
Since now.

1906
01:16:24,800 --> 01:16:26,920
...ln Central Bosnia.

1907
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,720
You look confused.

1908
01:16:29,800 --> 01:16:34,040
Well, uh, I thought they
declared peace in the Middle East.

1909
01:16:43,640 --> 01:16:44,920
Cher, get in here!

1910
01:16:44,960 --> 01:16:46,320
What's up, Daddy?

1911
01:16:46,360 --> 01:16:48,120
What are you doing dancing
in front of my office?

1912
01:16:48,160 --> 01:16:50,520
Nothing. I just wanted to see

1913
01:16:50,560 --> 01:16:52,880
if you need any help with anything.

1914
01:16:52,920 --> 01:16:55,120
Yeah, you can help me
with something.

1915
01:16:55,160 --> 01:16:56,560
Come over here.

1916
01:16:58,040 --> 01:16:59,920
All right.

1917
01:16:59,960 --> 01:17:01,840
Every time that you see

1918
01:17:01,880 --> 01:17:03,280
a telephone conversation

1919
01:17:03,320 --> 01:17:07,960
that took place on September 3rd,
highlight it.

1920
01:17:08,040 --> 01:17:10,000
- Just September 3rd.
- O.K.

1921
01:17:12,920 --> 01:17:14,800
It's fun, huh?

1922
01:17:14,840 --> 01:17:16,240
Yeah.

1923
01:17:17,720 --> 01:17:19,400
O.K.

1924
01:17:19,480 --> 01:17:22,000
Daddy, did you ever have a problem

1925
01:17:22,040 --> 01:17:24,080
that you couldn't
argue your way out of?

1926
01:17:24,120 --> 01:17:26,720
Tell me the problem,
and we'll figure out how to argue it.

1927
01:17:26,800 --> 01:17:30,600
I like this boy,
and he likes someone else.

1928
01:17:30,680 --> 01:17:32,240
How could that be?

1929
01:17:32,320 --> 01:17:34,480
I don't know. I feel wretched.

1930
01:17:34,520 --> 01:17:36,240
Obviously, this boy
is a complete moron.

1931
01:17:36,320 --> 01:17:40,400
You are the most beautiful girl
in Beverly Hills.

1932
01:17:40,480 --> 01:17:42,640
And to tell you the truth,

1933
01:17:42,680 --> 01:17:46,000
I'm not sure I want you
with a stupid fellow.

1934
01:17:46,040 --> 01:17:48,400
Well, actually, he is a smart guy.

1935
01:17:48,440 --> 01:17:50,800
He's one of those do-gooder types.

1936
01:17:50,840 --> 01:17:53,800
I feel like my after-school
commitments aren't good enough.

1937
01:17:53,880 --> 01:17:55,600
How can you say that?

1938
01:17:55,640 --> 01:17:58,000
Who takes care of everyone
in this household?

1939
01:17:58,040 --> 01:18:00,400
Who makes sure that
Daddy eats right?

1940
01:18:00,440 --> 01:18:04,520
I have not seen
such good-doing since your mother.

1941
01:18:04,600 --> 01:18:05,680
Really?

1942
01:18:05,720 --> 01:18:08,800
Really.

1943
01:18:08,880 --> 01:18:10,880
Now, get back to work.

1944
01:18:15,160 --> 01:18:18,640
Later, while we were learning
about the Pismo Beach disaster,

1945
01:18:18,680 --> 01:18:21,520
I decided I needed
a complete makeover,

1946
01:18:21,560 --> 01:18:24,880
except this time,
I'd makeover my soul.

1947
01:18:24,920 --> 01:18:27,280
But what makes somebody
a better person?

1948
01:18:27,320 --> 01:18:31,600
Then I realized all my friends
were good in different ways.

1949
01:18:31,640 --> 01:18:33,520
Like Christian,
he always wants things

1950
01:18:33,560 --> 01:18:35,320
to be beautiful and interesting.

1951
01:18:35,360 --> 01:18:36,760
Or Dionne and Murray,

1952
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:38,800
when they think no one is watching,

1953
01:18:38,840 --> 01:18:40,560
are so considerate of each other.

1954
01:18:40,600 --> 01:18:42,840
And poor Miss Geist,

1955
01:18:42,880 --> 01:18:44,960
always trying to get us involved

1956
01:18:45,040 --> 01:18:47,120
no matter how much we resist.

1957
01:18:47,200 --> 01:18:48,600
Oh. That's just...

1958
01:18:48,640 --> 01:18:50,240
That doesn't even show...

1959
01:18:50,320 --> 01:18:52,160
Every single possession,
every memory,

1960
01:18:52,240 --> 01:18:54,560
everything you've had
your whole life

1961
01:18:54,640 --> 01:18:56,000
gone in a second.

1962
01:18:56,080 --> 01:18:58,880
Can you imagine
what that must feel like?

1963
01:18:58,960 --> 01:19:00,320
Elton?

1964
01:19:00,400 --> 01:19:02,240
Can I use the pass?

1965
01:19:02,320 --> 01:19:05,120
Yeah. We'll be collecting blankets,
disposable diapers,

1966
01:19:05,200 --> 01:19:07,200
uh, canned goods.

1967
01:19:07,280 --> 01:19:08,480
Miss Geist?

1968
01:19:08,560 --> 01:19:09,920
Cher?

1969
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:11,600
I want to help.

1970
01:19:11,640 --> 01:19:13,920
That would be wonderful.

1971
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:15,520
I felt better already.

1972
01:19:18,640 --> 01:19:20,400
Daddy!

1973
01:19:20,440 --> 01:19:22,240
What?

1974
01:19:22,320 --> 01:19:23,920
You didn't like that
red caviar, did you?

1975
01:19:23,960 --> 01:19:26,080
What's she talking about?

1976
01:19:27,440 --> 01:19:28,640
Ew!

1977
01:19:38,640 --> 01:19:39,920
Cher, what are you doing?

1978
01:19:39,960 --> 01:19:44,120
I'm captain of the Pismo Beach
disaster relief.

1979
01:19:44,160 --> 01:19:45,720
I don't think
they need your skis.

1980
01:19:45,800 --> 01:19:48,240
Daddy, some people lost
all their belongings.

1981
01:19:48,320 --> 01:19:50,560
Don't you think that includes
athletic equipment?

1982
01:19:50,640 --> 01:19:53,400
This is your influence, Josh?

1983
01:19:59,160 --> 01:20:02,640
♪ Shake, some action's what I need ♪

1984
01:20:02,680 --> 01:20:06,920
♪ To make a bus stop at full speed ♪

1985
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:11,760
♪ And I'm sure that's all you'll need ♪

1986
01:20:11,840 --> 01:20:14,000
♪ To make it all right? ♪

1987
01:20:14,080 --> 01:20:15,440
...Really fun.

1988
01:20:17,400 --> 01:20:18,760
It's so pretty.

1989
01:20:18,840 --> 01:20:20,680
Should I leave it here?

1990
01:20:20,760 --> 01:20:23,080
Could you bring it to bedding?

1991
01:20:23,160 --> 01:20:24,440
Thank you very much.

1992
01:20:25,920 --> 01:20:28,560
Oh, Miss Geist,
I need more boxes.

1993
01:20:28,640 --> 01:20:30,040
They're all filled up.

1994
01:20:30,080 --> 01:20:31,120
Already? Great.

1995
01:20:31,200 --> 01:20:34,040
I divided them into
entrees and appetizers.

1996
01:20:34,080 --> 01:20:37,000
Oh. O.K.
I'll have them picked up.

1997
01:20:39,320 --> 01:20:40,600
Uh!

1998
01:20:42,360 --> 01:20:43,440
Hey.

1999
01:20:43,480 --> 01:20:46,320
Proper. This is really decent
of you, Travis.

2000
01:20:46,360 --> 01:20:48,200
Sure.

2001
01:20:48,280 --> 01:20:50,240
I wasn't sure about that.

2002
01:20:50,320 --> 01:20:51,720
I don't need it anymore,

2003
01:20:51,800 --> 01:20:55,080
but far be it for me
to deny anyone else.

2004
01:20:55,160 --> 01:20:56,840
I'm sorry about your shoes.

2005
01:20:56,920 --> 01:20:57,960
What shoes?

2006
01:20:58,040 --> 01:21:00,320
The red ones with the strappy thing.

2007
01:21:00,400 --> 01:21:02,120
Oh, those are so last-season.

2008
01:21:02,200 --> 01:21:03,600
What made you think of them?

2009
01:21:03,680 --> 01:21:05,000
It's one of my steps.

2010
01:21:05,080 --> 01:21:08,880
I joined this club,
and there are these steps.

2011
01:21:08,920 --> 01:21:10,280
There's, like...

2012
01:21:10,360 --> 01:21:11,400
12?

2013
01:21:11,480 --> 01:21:12,840
Yeah. How did you know?

2014
01:21:12,920 --> 01:21:13,800
Wild guess.

2015
01:21:13,880 --> 01:21:15,240
Wow. Good guess.

2016
01:21:15,320 --> 01:21:17,360
Uh, also, here.

2017
01:21:17,400 --> 01:21:18,920
ASL.

2018
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:21,280
Amateur skateboarding league.

2019
01:21:21,360 --> 01:21:24,680
This clarity thing,
it's brought me to a whole new level.

2020
01:21:24,760 --> 01:21:26,280
My skating...
Would you come Saturday?

2021
01:21:26,360 --> 01:21:27,920
Sure.

2022
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:29,120
Ah, cool.

2023
01:21:29,200 --> 01:21:30,440
Ha ha!

2024
01:21:30,520 --> 01:21:33,400
Well, um,
I guess kitchenware?

2025
01:21:33,480 --> 01:21:35,160
That's where I used to keep it.

2026
01:21:50,120 --> 01:21:51,480
Hi.

2027
01:21:51,560 --> 01:21:52,920
Hi.

2028
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:55,320
Cher, can I talk
to you a minute?

2029
01:21:55,400 --> 01:21:56,440
Um, sure.

2030
01:21:56,520 --> 01:21:59,160
Look, I have been in agony
for the past week.

2031
01:21:59,240 --> 01:22:01,720
I can't believe
I went off the way I did.

2032
01:22:01,800 --> 01:22:04,200
No. I have been going
down a shame spiral.

2033
01:22:04,280 --> 01:22:06,280
I can't believe
I was so unsupportive

2034
01:22:06,360 --> 01:22:07,800
of your feelings for Josh.

2035
01:22:07,880 --> 01:22:10,000
You're entitled to your opinion.

2036
01:22:10,040 --> 01:22:11,560
I'm the tard here.

2037
01:22:11,640 --> 01:22:14,240
Cher, you've been nothing
but super-duper nice to me.

2038
01:22:14,320 --> 01:22:17,600
If it wasn't for me,
you wouldn't have liked Elton.

2039
01:22:17,680 --> 01:22:19,520
I'm so sorry, Tai.

2040
01:22:19,600 --> 01:22:21,880
I'm really sorry.

2041
01:22:21,920 --> 01:22:25,000
Oh, shit. Now I'm going
to go ahead and cry.

2042
01:22:25,080 --> 01:22:27,120
Let's never fight again, O.K.?

2043
01:22:27,160 --> 01:22:30,040
Next up, number 14,
Travis Birkenstock.

2044
01:22:51,400 --> 01:22:53,520
Woo! All right, Travis!

2045
01:22:56,800 --> 01:22:59,640
I had no idea
he was so motivated.

2046
01:22:59,680 --> 01:23:02,880
Oh, I did.

2047
01:23:02,960 --> 01:23:04,800
When I saw the sparks
between Tai and Travis,

2048
01:23:04,880 --> 01:23:08,160
I knew Josh was
out of the picture.

2049
01:23:17,400 --> 01:23:19,280
You look like Pippi Longstocking.

2050
01:23:19,320 --> 01:23:21,200
You look like Forrest Gump.

2051
01:23:22,520 --> 01:23:24,080
Who's Pippi Longstocking?

2052
01:23:24,120 --> 01:23:26,960
Uh, someone Mel Gibson
never played.

2053
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:28,920
You're funny.

2054
01:23:37,640 --> 01:23:38,920
What happened to
the August 28th files?

2055
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:40,800
Hmm? What?

2056
01:23:40,880 --> 01:23:42,640
Mel wanted them tonight.
There were twice as many.

2057
01:23:42,680 --> 01:23:44,640
He's going to go ballistic.

2058
01:23:44,720 --> 01:23:46,400
Where are they?

2059
01:23:46,480 --> 01:23:48,000
I think I checked them

2060
01:23:48,080 --> 01:23:49,520
for the September 3rd
conversations.

2061
01:23:49,560 --> 01:23:51,360
What?

2062
01:23:51,440 --> 01:23:52,800
Where'd you put them?

2063
01:23:52,880 --> 01:23:54,720
I divided them
into two piles.

2064
01:23:54,800 --> 01:23:56,200
I have to redo all that.

2065
01:23:56,280 --> 01:23:57,440
Are you some kind of idiot?

2066
01:23:57,520 --> 01:23:59,040
Hey, she didn't know.

2067
01:23:59,120 --> 01:24:00,960
She just set us back a day.

2068
01:24:01,040 --> 01:24:02,600
Who cares about
the September call?

2069
01:24:02,680 --> 01:24:03,840
I'm sorry.

2070
01:24:03,920 --> 01:24:05,400
Just forget it.

2071
01:24:05,480 --> 01:24:07,800
Just go back to the mall
or something.

2072
01:24:09,200 --> 01:24:11,080
[Josh]
What's your problem, man?

2073
01:24:11,160 --> 01:24:13,200
She didn't mean any harm.

2074
01:24:13,280 --> 01:24:14,680
I'll get killed
'cause she's a moron.

2075
01:24:14,720 --> 01:24:15,680
She's not a moron.

2076
01:24:15,760 --> 01:24:17,280
If you were paying attention,

2077
01:24:17,360 --> 01:24:18,720
it wouldn't have happened.

2078
01:24:18,800 --> 01:24:20,160
If you hadn't have been
playing footsie,

2079
01:24:20,240 --> 01:24:21,680
she wouldn't be bothering me.

2080
01:24:21,760 --> 01:24:24,480
What the hell are you talking about?

2081
01:24:24,560 --> 01:24:26,840
This is a multimillion dollar lawsuit,

2082
01:24:26,880 --> 01:24:28,760
not some excuse for puppy love.

2083
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:31,160
We've worked
our butts off on this case!

2084
01:24:31,200 --> 01:24:34,040
Do whatever you want
with your butts.

2085
01:24:34,080 --> 01:24:35,480
I'm calling in sick.

2086
01:24:40,400 --> 01:24:42,920
Did I really ruin
Daddy's lawsuit?

2087
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:44,560
No.

2088
01:24:47,360 --> 01:24:48,760
Of course not.

2089
01:24:48,800 --> 01:24:50,800
Well, did I set him back?

2090
01:24:50,880 --> 01:24:53,240
I mean, there's
so much work to be done,

2091
01:24:53,280 --> 01:24:55,640
and he can't afford
to lose that time.

2092
01:24:55,680 --> 01:24:58,040
Don't worry.
I'll take care of it.

2093
01:24:58,080 --> 01:25:00,080
Your father won't lose any time.

2094
01:25:00,160 --> 01:25:03,000
Can you imagine
the nerve of that guy?

2095
01:25:03,040 --> 01:25:06,160
I mean, making
you worry like that.

2096
01:25:06,240 --> 01:25:09,080
He's the one that screwed up.

2097
01:25:09,120 --> 01:25:10,600
Then he goes and blames us.

2098
01:25:10,680 --> 01:25:12,440
Imagine saying we were...

2099
01:25:12,480 --> 01:25:15,920
you know.

2100
01:25:15,960 --> 01:25:19,440
That's right. You've been
very dedicated to this case.

2101
01:25:19,520 --> 01:25:21,520
Yeah. Well, it was
a good learning experience.

2102
01:25:21,600 --> 01:25:24,840
At least for me.
I want to be a lawyer.

2103
01:25:24,920 --> 01:25:28,680
But you, I mean,
you don't need to be doing this.

2104
01:25:28,760 --> 01:25:31,760
Go out and have fun.
Go shopping.

2105
01:25:33,560 --> 01:25:35,400
You think that's all I do?

2106
01:25:35,480 --> 01:25:37,800
I'm just a ditz
with a credit card?

2107
01:25:37,880 --> 01:25:38,800
No, no.

2108
01:25:38,840 --> 01:25:41,160
That's not what I meant.

2109
01:25:41,240 --> 01:25:43,560
It's just... um...

2110
01:25:43,640 --> 01:25:45,760
Uh, th...

2111
01:25:45,840 --> 01:25:48,840
You're... young

2112
01:25:48,920 --> 01:25:52,200
and beautiful and...

2113
01:25:52,280 --> 01:25:53,880
And?

2114
01:25:53,960 --> 01:25:58,480
And, uh, well, what?

2115
01:25:58,520 --> 01:26:01,160
You think I'm beautiful?

2116
01:26:01,240 --> 01:26:04,200
Mmm... yeah, a little.

2117
01:26:04,280 --> 01:26:07,080
You know you're gorgeous,
all right?

2118
01:26:07,160 --> 01:26:11,880
And popular and, uh, and...

2119
01:26:11,960 --> 01:26:14,280
but this is not
why I come here.

2120
01:26:14,360 --> 01:26:17,920
This is a good
learning experience for me.

2121
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:21,040
You already said that.

2122
01:26:21,080 --> 01:26:23,840
Mel. I want to help out Mel.

2123
01:26:23,920 --> 01:26:26,320
He's the only one
who cares about me.

2124
01:26:26,360 --> 01:26:28,840
That's not true.

2125
01:26:28,920 --> 01:26:30,640
He's not?

2126
01:26:30,680 --> 01:26:33,120
No.

2127
01:26:33,200 --> 01:26:36,920
Are you saying...
you care about me?

2128
01:26:36,960 --> 01:26:39,160
Josh.

2129
01:26:55,080 --> 01:26:58,160
Well, you can guess
what happened next.

2130
01:26:58,280 --> 01:26:59,800
As if!

2131
01:26:59,880 --> 01:27:01,240
I am only 16.

2132
01:27:01,320 --> 01:27:03,640
This is California, not Kentucky.

2133
01:27:03,680 --> 01:27:05,560
You may kiss the bride.

2134
01:27:26,280 --> 01:27:29,080
I know that
when I have my own wedding,

2135
01:27:29,160 --> 01:27:31,960
I want this, like,
whole, entire floral motif,

2136
01:27:32,040 --> 01:27:33,400
like, very floral garlands.

2137
01:27:33,480 --> 01:27:34,840
No, no, no.

2138
01:27:34,920 --> 01:27:37,720
When I get married,
I'll have a sailor dress,

2139
01:27:37,800 --> 01:27:39,640
but it will be a gown.

2140
01:27:39,720 --> 01:27:41,280
My bridesmaids
will wear sailor hats.

2141
01:27:41,360 --> 01:27:43,240
They're planning
our weddings already.

2142
01:27:43,320 --> 01:27:45,160
Could you all stop that

2143
01:27:45,240 --> 01:27:47,800
till death do us part
mumbo jumbo?

2144
01:27:47,880 --> 01:27:49,240
I'm completely buggin'.

2145
01:27:49,320 --> 01:27:50,640
I'm buggin' myself.

2146
01:27:50,680 --> 01:27:52,600
Girls, she's about
to throw the bouquet!

2147
01:27:52,680 --> 01:27:55,000
Come on!

2148
01:27:55,040 --> 01:27:58,360
We got a pool going to see
whose girl gets the bouquet.

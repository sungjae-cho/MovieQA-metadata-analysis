00:13:09,421 --> 00:13:11,685
Just spoke with her.
She'll be here any second.

[<i>#</i> Steve Rushton: <i>Everything I Want]</i>

169
00:13:16,595 --> 00:13:18,756
Rico, what's this hole
at the top of the cake?

170
00:13:20,332 --> 00:13:23,165
It's a high-pressure
electro-pneumatic solenoid on it.

171
00:13:23,202 --> 00:13:27,662
It's 150 pounds per square inch
with a brass safety-check valve.

172
00:13:27,706 --> 00:13:31,938
Then I just hit this button
and bam! Sparklers go off,

173
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:35,572
and a "happy birthday, Lilly" banner
shoots out the top of the cake.

174
00:13:35,614 --> 00:13:38,447
Once again...
[rolling R] Rico is a genius.

175
00:13:50,129 --> 00:13:54,589
Hold it! This is a private event.
Guests only! What did I tell you? Stop!

176
00:13:54,633 --> 00:13:56,066
- Smile.
- No pictures.

[Gasps] That's what I call a Lilly...
Wow.

178
00:14:04,109 --> 00:14:05,906
[Girl] It's Hannah Montana!

Guys, I'm only here... Wait!

183
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:30,798
Happy birthday to... I want to say happy
birthday to my number one fan, Lilly.

184
00:14:30,836 --> 00:14:33,930
She's over that way.
She's over that way.

185
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:40,042
Happy birthday, Lilly. Happy birthday.

186
00:14:40,612 --> 00:14:43,604
I'm sorry. I had no choice.
I'll make it up to you, I promise.

187
00:14:43,649 --> 00:14:47,551
You will never, ever, ever
make it up to me.

188
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:51,646
- I'm sorry.

Hold up. Wait. Birthday Girl,
I have some questions.

210
00:16:17,809 --> 00:16:21,472
Is it true Hannah's really 43 years old?
She lip syncs? Grew up in Nashville?

211
00:16:21,513 --> 00:16:24,448
More like a cornfield in
some place called Crowley Corners.

212
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:26,508
Really? How do you spell "Crowley"?

213

It's Lilly Truscott, everybody!
Happy birthday.

- Lilly!
- Oliver? Quick!

stop Lilly from leaving.

Lilly, please pick up.

224
00:17:10,896 --> 00:17:13,922
- [Robby Ray] Did you see this?
- Yeah, I know. It's everywhere.

225
00:17:13,965 --> 00:17:16,525
Isn't it... horrible. Bad Hannah.

226
00:17:16,568 --> 00:17:18,695
She and I need to have
a little conversation.

227
00:17:18,737 --> 00:17:22,070
Now? But she's getting ready
to go to New York.

228
00:17:22,107 --> 00:17:24,735
Didn't she tell you?
There's an amazing opportunity.

229
00:17:24,776 --> 00:17:28,234
Yeah, I know about New York. I got
CCed in an e-mail. Not happening.

230
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:31,477
She and I are flying to Tennessee
for her Grandma Ruby's birthday.

231
00:17:31,516 --> 00:17:33,575
Didn't she tell you?

232
00:17:33,618 --> 00:17:37,748
A shoe fight! You got
into a stinking shoe fight?

233
00:17:37,789 --> 00:17:40,121
In my defense,
I totally saw those shoes first.

234
00:17:40,158 --> 00:17:45,357
This is absolutely, T-totally,
without a doubt unacceptable.

235
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:48,264
Which pretty much describes
all of your behavior lately.

236
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:51,667
Standing up your brother?
Humiliating Lilly at her own party?

237
00:17:51,703 --> 00:17:54,763
I know. I screwed up. I'm sorry,
but I can't talk about this now.

238
00:17:54,806 --> 00:17:56,774
I got to go to New York.
It's the music awards.

239
00:17:56,808 --> 00:17:59,072
Your grandmother's birthday
doesn't matter?

240
00:17:59,111 --> 00:18:01,136
This is totally different
and you know it.

241
00:18:01,179 --> 00:18:03,443
Now, Robby. Mr. Ray.

242
00:18:03,482 --> 00:18:07,077
Father Montana, Hannah not going
to New York is really not an option.

243
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:10,714
- Her name is Miley.
- Miley'll be back before she leaves.

244
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:13,589
She's a superstar. I can get her
a private jet if she wants.

245
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:16,219
Yes! I've always wanted
one of those.

246
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:17,660
For gosh sakes.

247
00:18:21,566 --> 00:18:24,126
Fine. You win.

248
00:18:24,169 --> 00:18:26,569
But you heard our superstar.
She needs a jet.

249
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:28,436
- Really?
- I like your thinking.

250
00:18:28,473 --> 00:18:30,100
It will take some time to arrange,

251
00:18:30,142 --> 00:18:32,872
but I'll go ahead to New York
and set up the meet and greet.

252
00:18:42,821 --> 00:18:47,417
Ooh. Next time, you might want to
demand a jet with a bigger bathroom.

253
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:49,552
Why in the heck you
getting all Hannahed up?

254
00:18:49,594 --> 00:18:51,755
The Hannah steps off the plane photo op.

255
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:55,324
The balloons, the limos,
the screaming fans.

256
00:18:55,367 --> 00:18:58,803
Like Vita says,
"It's all about the publicity."

257
00:18:58,837 --> 00:19:02,739
Yeah. That Vita's
just full of good advice.

258
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:06,406
Absolutely full of it.

259
00:19:09,581 --> 00:19:11,811

Ain't she a beaut?

263
00:19:29,634 --> 00:19:32,228
Yee doggies. Tennessee.

264
00:19:38,143 --> 00:19:39,576
Dad, come on.

265
00:19:39,611 --> 00:19:42,307
Yeah, maybe I should've
remembered Grandma's birthday.

266
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:45,077
- I did.
- Jackson, not now.

267
00:19:45,116 --> 00:19:48,677
Dad! Please, Hannah Montana
needs to be walking down the red carpet

268
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,654
in New York in less than three hours.

269
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:53,852
Miley, all you ever
wanted to do was sing.

270
00:19:53,892 --> 00:19:56,588
Hannah let you do that
and still have a normal life.

271
00:19:56,628 --> 00:19:58,391
That was the dream, remember?

272
00:19:59,798 --> 00:20:02,961
That's why we
created her in the first place.

273
00:20:03,001 --> 00:20:05,231
I don't know what she's about anymore.

274
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:08,364
- What are you saying?
- I think we might be done.

275
00:20:11,109 --> 00:20:14,840
- You can't take Hannah away from me.
- Really? Because that's what I'm doing.

276
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,008
No! Stop the truck. I'm not
doing this. I want to go home.

277
00:20:18,583 --> 00:20:19,777
Stop the truck!

278
00:20:38,537 --> 00:20:41,597
You are home. Look around you.

279
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,232
Hannah means everything to me.

280
00:20:43,275 --> 00:20:45,334
That right there might be the problem.

281
00:20:49,648 --> 00:20:51,741
You're saying I can
never be Hannah again?

282
00:20:51,783 --> 00:20:54,411
Ask me again in two weeks.

283
00:20:54,452 --> 00:20:56,818
Right now let's see
if a country girl still exists.

284
00:20:56,855 --> 00:21:00,154
- Two weeks?
- Think of it as a Hannah detox.

285
00:21:00,191 --> 00:21:02,284
Take that wig off
and get back in the truck.

286
00:21:02,327 --> 00:21:07,128
No. I'm not getting
back in the truck. No way.

287
00:21:15,574 --> 00:21:17,633
I'm not getting back in the truck, Dad.

288
00:21:17,676 --> 00:21:21,373
I'm going to New York whether you
like it or not, and I'm not... Whoa!

289
00:21:22,647 --> 00:21:24,410
Give that back, you mangy little...

290

Look at that. Girl don't even
recognize her own horse.

291
00:21:28,353 --> 00:21:30,150
Now that truly is sad.

In my defense, you do look different.

296
00:22:02,387 --> 00:22:04,048

All right, now. Help me out.

299

Hi. You all right?

307
00:23:43,822 --> 00:23:46,290
Blue Jeans doesn't really
take well to strangers.

308
00:23:46,324 --> 00:23:49,623
Especially not dirty, sparkly ones.

309
00:23:51,029 --> 00:23:53,657
I know. He's my horse.

310
00:23:56,835 --> 00:23:58,097
Miley?

311
00:23:59,304 --> 00:24:01,704
It's me. Travis?

312
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:05,733
Travis Brody? We were
in the first grade together.

313
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:08,041
Me and you went to your
Uncle Earl's farm and swam

314
00:24:08,079 --> 00:24:11,139
- and got poison oak all over our...
- I remember you, OK?

315
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:14,710
I also remember you hanging me
headfirst down a well.

316
00:24:14,753 --> 00:24:17,881
Yeah. I guess I had a
pretty big crush on you back then.

317
00:24:17,922 --> 00:24:19,981
But don't worry about it.

318
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:24,694
I'm over it. [scoffs]

319
00:24:25,764 --> 00:24:26,992
Good to know.

320
00:24:29,801 --> 00:24:31,996
Don't come around
too often anymore, do you?

321
00:24:32,036 --> 00:24:33,799
[Miley] Often enough.

322
00:24:33,838 --> 00:24:36,773
Only a couple times since your
ma died that I've heard about.

323
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:39,333
[Clears throat]
So how long are you staying?

324
00:24:39,377 --> 00:24:40,674
- Two weeks.
- Ha!

325
00:24:40,712 --> 00:24:43,704
- Good luck with that.
- What's that supposed to mean?

326
00:24:43,748 --> 00:24:46,342
Considering what you're wearing

327
00:24:46,384 --> 00:24:48,978
and the fact that you couldn't
get back on your horse,

328
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:50,988
I'm guessing you
went California on us.

329
00:24:51,022 --> 00:24:55,083
I have not. You don't know
anything about me or California.

330
00:24:55,894 --> 00:24:58,988
Let me guess, celebrities are
just regular folk like you and me.

331
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:01,760
- Some are.
- Oh. Uh-huh.

332
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,927
You, uh... you

01:01:07,897 --> 01:01:09,888
Are you all right?
Let me help you.

832
01:01:09,932 --> 01:01:11,092
I'm OK. I'm OK.

833
01:01:16,005 --> 01:01:18,166
Mmm.

834
01:01:18,207 --> 01:01:21,973
These taste... healthy.
What's in them?

835
01:01:22,812 --> 01:01:23,938
Squash.

836
01:01:26,082 --> 01:01:29,643
Ooh. I want a cowboy.

837
01:01:29,685 --> 01:01:32,313
Sorry. That one's taken.

838
01:01:32,355 --> 01:01:33,549
- Really?
- Yeah.

839
01:01:35,257 --> 01:01:37,248
No.

840
01:01:37,293 --> 01:01:40,421
Maybe. I don't know. It looks like
we're going to be just friends.

841
01:01:41,630 --> 01:01:43,188
But he hasn't met Hannah yet.

842
01:01:44,066 --> 01:01:46,796
- Come on.

843
01:01:48,437 --> 01:01:50,598

844
01:01:50,639 --> 01:01:54,598
- So, Ha...
- [drilling loudly]

845
01:01:54,643 --> 01:01:56,076
- Ha...
- [drilling loudly]

846
01:01:57,880 --> 01:01:59,472
Hey, look! It's Hannah Montana!

847
01:02:01,283 --> 01:02:04,616
Oh, hi. Sorry, I... I didn't see you.

848
01:02:04,653 --> 01:02:06,518
I'm Travis. Thanks for coming.

849
01:02:06,555 --> 01:02:11,219
Yeah, happy to help.
This is Lilly. She's my assistant.

850
01:02:11,260 --> 01:02:12,784
Executive assistant.

851
01:02:13,763 --> 01:02:15,754
Welcome to Crowley Corners.

852
01:02:15,798 --> 01:02:19,825
It sure would be nice to have
someone to... show us around.

853
01:02:19,869 --> 01:02:21,393
- Real smooth.
- What?

854
01:02:21,437 --> 01:02:25,931
Look, I really don't think
I'm your guy. But nice to meet you.

855
01:02:25,975 --> 01:02:28,967
- [Sputters]
- No, go. Go!

856
01:02:31,313 --> 01:02:34,908
So... putting up a satellite dish.

857
01:02:35,885 --> 01:02:37,944
It's a birdbath.

858
01:02:37,987 --> 01:02:40,012
- [Laughs]
- I knew that.

859
01:02:41,657 --> 01:02:44,421
Lilly, could you go find
the owner of this fine house

860
01:02:44,460 --> 01:02:46,485
and run them through my dietary needs?

861
01:02:47,163 --> 01:02:48,596
Go. Assist.

862
01:02:49,765 --> 01:02:51,630
OK.

863
01:02:53,702 --> 01:02:56,000
So, you and Miley are pretty close, huh?

864
01:02:56,972 --> 01:02:58,337
You have no idea.

865
01:02:59,975 --> 01:03:03,240
[Laughs] You don't have to answer
if you think this is too personal,

866
01:03:03,279 --> 01:03:06,715
but you think she'd go out
with me if I asked?

867
01:03:06,749 --> 01:03:08,307
You want to go out with Miley?

868
01:03:09,085 --> 01:03:11,747
No, you'd be a real prize.
Don't get me wrong, but...

869
01:03:13,522 --> 01:03:15,922
But Miley...

870
01:03:15,958 --> 01:03:18,051
I can't help but smile
when I'm around her.

871
01:03:19,595 --> 01:03:23,588
I think about her all the time. And I...

872
01:03:23,632 --> 01:03:25,031
You should go ask her out.

873
01:03:26,702 --> 01:03:28,727
- Really?
- Mm-hm.

874
01:03:30,639 --> 01:03:34,040
Yeah. Yeah, I'm going
to do that right now.

875
01:03:34,076 --> 01:03:36,271
No, no. No. Excuse me.

876
01:03:36,312 --> 01:03:39,281
You can't go in there.
She's not home. Miley! She's not home.

877
01:03:39,315 --> 01:03:42,580
She said something about going
to the barn and brushing Blue Jeans.

878
01:03:42,618 --> 01:03:45,678
You should go ask her there.
Go, go, go! Go. Goodbye.

879
01:03:46,489 --> 01:03:47,751
Go!

880
01:03:50,526 --> 01:03:53,154
- Slow down, hot stuff.
- Got to go. Got to go. Got to go.

881
01:03:53,195 --> 01:03:55,322
[Chickens clucking]

882
01:03:55,364 --> 01:03:56,695
Miley?

883
01:03:56,732 --> 01:04:00,395
[Gasping]

884
01:04:01,370 --> 01:04:05,431
[Travis] Miley! Miley, are you?

885
01:04:05,474 --> 01:04:06,839
Hey, slacker.

886
01:04:08,377 --> 01:04:09,844
Uh, hey.

887
01:04:11,247 --> 01:04:13,807
I was just talking
to your friend, Hannah.

888
01:04:15,351 --> 01:04:17,478
Actually, we were talking about you.

889
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:20,250
Oh, really. Was there
something you wanted to say

890
01:04:20,289 --> 01:04:23,190
or ask me or talk to me about?

891
01:04:24,426 --> 01:04:26,758
Well, I know you're going home soon.

892
01:04:26,795 --> 01:04:29,559
Yeah, I am. That's right,
Travis, keep going.

893
01:04:29,598 --> 01:04:32,931
Um, well...

894
01:04:32,968 --> 01:04:37,337
I was wondering if maybe you would like
to go to dinner with me this evening.

895
01:04:38,407 --> 01:04:40,739
OK. Sure.

896
01:04:40,776 --> 01:04:43,267
I don't think I have
any other plans, so sounds good.

897
01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:46,874
- Cool.
- Cool.

898
01:04:52,655 --> 01:04:53,952
Cool.

899
01:04:53,989 --> 01:04:56,549
Now you're talking.
Oh, that is the one.

900
01:04:56,592 --> 01:04:58,924
Yeah, it would be,
but she's not going.

901
01:04:58,961 --> 01:05:00,258
What do you mean I can't go?

902
01:05:00,296 --> 01:05:02,696
You're the one that promised
Lorelai that Hannah

903
01:05:02,731 --> 01:05:05,928
would be the guest of honor at
the mayor's lobster hoo-hah tonight.

904
01:05:05,968 --> 01:05:08,835
- Actually, Lilly did.
- Actually, Hannah did.

905
01:05:08,871 --> 01:05:10,361
But I promised Travis.

906
01:05:10,406 --> 01:05:13,500
You know what?
Then I'll just leave it up to you.

907
01:05:13,542 --> 01:05:15,305
You do whatever you think is right.

908
01:05:16,378 --> 01:05:17,504
But...

909
01:05:31,660 --> 01:05:34,754
[girls screaming]

910
01:05:38,500 --> 01:05:40,229
It's Hannah Montana!

911
01:05:47,576 --> 01:05:50,272
Can I have your autograph,
Hannah Montana?

912
01:05:56,218 --> 01:05:57,310
[Vita] Smile.

913
01:05:58,487 --> 01:06:00,717
- Yeah!
- Perfect.

914
01:06:03,058 --> 01:06:05,049
Where's Miley?
She should be here by now.

915
01:06:05,094 --> 01:06:09,793
Hon, she's got
East Coast-West Nile disease.

916
01:06:09,832 --> 01:06:12,232
- That sucker's traveling.
- Yeah.

917
01:06:13,435 --> 01:06:16,802
If everybody could please
take their seats.

918
01:06:16,839 --> 01:06:19,967
- Yes, be seated, everybody.
- Find their place card there.

919
01:06:20,009 --> 01:06:25,174
And let me just say that, honestly,

920
01:06:25,214 --> 01:06:27,512
to have someone of your talents,

921
01:06:27,549 --> 01:06:31,383
well, Miss Montana, Hannah, if you will,

922
01:06:31,420 --> 01:06:36,881
your offer of a concert tomorrow to save
Crowley Meadows from such a sad fate,

923
01:06:36,925 --> 01:06:42,192
well, our humble little corner
of the world can't thank you enough.

924
01:06:42,231 --> 01:06:44,699
And if there's ever anything that myself

925
01:06:44,733 --> 01:06:48,032
or the good people of
Crowley Corners can do for you,

926
01:06:48,070 --> 01:06:51,801
anything you need,
all you have to do is...

927
01:06:53,008 --> 01:06:54,532
Where did she go?

928
01:06:55,577 --> 01:07:00,014
Need. I just need to check on my fans.

929

930
01:07:01,950 --> 01:07:07,411
See? But what I really need
is I need to go to the bathroom.

931
01:07:07,456 --> 01:07:10,584
I need to go. Lilly,
come with me. Right now!

932
01:07:14,563 --> 01:07:16,588
Makeup, clothes, it's all in there. Go.

933
01:07:19,868 --> 01:07:23,031
- I'll be right back. Cover for me.
- OK.

935
01:07:34,383 --> 01:07:35,680
Hey.

936
01:07:35,718 --> 01:07:39,119
- Sorry I'm late.
- You're not late. I was early.

937
01:07:40,122 --> 01:07:43,091
- I got you these.
- Thank you.

938
01:07:45,661 --> 01:07:47,856
You do know you only have one earring?

939
01:07:48,997 --> 01:07:50,362
Trendy L.A. Thing.

940
01:07:54,803 --> 01:07:57,465
- I guess you're going back there soon?
- Mm-hm. Yeah.

941
01:07:57,506 --> 01:07:59,371
Uh...

942
01:08:01,710 --> 01:08:04,008
- I'm going to go ahead and jump.
- Please jump.

943
01:08:06,181 --> 01:08:08,308
- Well, Miley...
- Uh-huh.

944
01:08:08,350 --> 01:08:09,647
Before you leave...

945
01:08:09,685 --> 01:08:13,382
[laughs]... I just...

946
01:08:13,422 --> 01:08:15,822
I really want you to know
how I feel about you.

- Um...

Is everything all right?

950
01:08:28,103 --> 01:08:32,096
I really should take this. I'm sorry,
it will just be a second. I swear.

951
01:08:32,141 --> 01:08:34,735
I'll probably get better
reception in the back.

952
01:08:34,777 --> 01:08:37,337
I got two bars. Three bars.

953
01:08:38,280 --> 01:08:39,508
Four bars!

has returned, dig in!

Oh!

962
01:09:17,352 --> 01:09:21,186
So, Hannah, you must have
a lot of wonderful stories to tell.

963
01:09:21,223 --> 01:09:22,588
Not really.

964
01:09:24,860 --> 01:09:27,658
I mean there are just so many.

965
01:09:27,696 --> 01:09:30,756
But I don't want this evening
to be all about me.

966
01:09:30,799 --> 01:09:34,132
I mean, everybody's stories
are important, right, Jackson?

967
01:09:34,169 --> 01:09:36,399
- Huh?
- You just started college.

968
01:09:36,438 --> 01:09:39,532
- Tell us about your classes.
- Yeah, my classes. Uh...

- I really like...

I think my favorite part is...

is growing up into a man.

- Oh!

Oops, dropped my napkin.

- Harlow!
- Ow!

- What are you doing?
- Looking for a ferret.

- What are you doing?
- Trying to have my first

978
01:10:04,633 --> 01:10:07,033

Now get back up there.

979
01:10:10,239 --> 01:10:11,263
Found it.

01:10:24,353 --> 01:10:25,547
Um...

981
01:10:28,290 --> 01:10:31,987
- I'm having the lobster.
- It's not on the menu.

982
01:10:32,027 --> 01:10:33,289
Right.

983
01:10:41,837 --> 01:10:45,967
Sorry. It's been a weird
couple of days, but...

984
01:10:46,008 --> 01:10:48,203
Yeah.

985
01:10:48,243 --> 01:10:51,644
And I think I know some of
the things you want to tell me.

986
01:10:54,550 --> 01:10:56,609
Yeah?

987
01:10:56,652 --> 01:10:59,644
There are so many things
I want to tell you, too, and...

988
01:11:03,358 --> 01:11:04,985
That's just going to have to wait.

989
01:11:05,027 --> 01:11:07,018
I need to go double-check
on my lobsters.

- Club soda will take that out.
- Sit! That's enough.

993
01:11:56,612 --> 01:11:58,910
No one is getting up
from this table. No one.

994
01:11:59,715 --> 01:12:01,478
Dessert, anyone?

995
01:12:01,516 --> 01:12:03,882
I'm sure you've all heard
of baked Alaska.

996
01:12:03,919 --> 01:12:06,012
We give you Tennessee flambe.

997
01:12:10,592 --> 01:12:13,493
Mr. Mayor, I assume that
you'd like to say a few final words?

998
01:12:13,528 --> 01:12:15,587
Oh, yes, yes.

999
01:12:15,631 --> 01:12:19,658

flambe was actually invented by...

01:33:43,417 --> 01:33:46,784
This nice lady sorted it all out.
Two free tickets.

1174
01:33:46,820 --> 01:33:48,617
Upper class. It was brilliant!

1175
01:33:48,656 --> 01:33:51,591
I thought the girls'd appreciate
a couple of free tickets.

1176
01:33:51,625 --> 01:33:53,388
We too late?
She going to sing again?

1177
01:33:53,427 --> 01:33:55,793
I can't believe that
I'm only one degree away...

1179

- It's really her!

1180
01:34:01,769 --> 01:34:03,760
- You're right there! I'm here!
- I can't believe it!

1181
01:34:03,804 --> 01:34:06,568
I really love you.
We're your biggest fans ever, really.

1182
01:34:06,607 --> 01:34:09,007
You're not going to destroy
their dreams, are you?

1183
01:34:09,043 --> 01:34:10,601
That's what Hannah's all about.

1184
01:34:11,879 --> 01:34:15,508
- Is that your story?
- I must be dreaming! Pinch me!

1185
01:34:15,549 --> 01:34:18,416
No, that's not my story.

1186
01:34:18,452 --> 01:34:21,046
- [Phoebe] Oh, my gosh!
- [Whistles] Girls!

[Vita] Come on. Let's go out front.
I think Hannah's got more songs in her.

1194
01:34:45,245 --> 01:34:47,042
Thanks, partner.

on you, and I said I was over it?

1198
01:34:55,422 --> 01:34:56,446
Yeah.

1199
01:34:58,258 --> 01:34:59,816
Uh...

1
00:00:51,388 --> 00:00:53,753
Hang on. I know.

2
00:00:53,956 --> 00:00:55,820
Mm.

3
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:58,151
You're doing so good.

4
00:00:58,326 --> 00:01:00,054
You're doing so good.
You all right?

5
00:01:00,227 --> 00:01:01,853
- Yeah.
- Okay.

6
00:01:02,028 --> 00:01:04,860
Dr. Matthews to the nurses' station.

7
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:06,588
Excuse me.

8
00:01:06,765 --> 00:01:10,756
My wife's in labor.
We called ahead for Dr. Wheeler.

9
00:01:10,967 --> 00:01:12,957
I just need you to fill this out, please.

10
00:01:14,336 --> 00:01:16,462
- Thank you.
- Have a seat, hon.

11
00:01:14,336 --> 00:01:16,462
- Thank you.
- Have a seat, hon.

12
00:01:25,276 --> 00:01:28,267
- Okay?
- Okay.

13
00:01:29,346 --> 00:01:32,075
- Is this your first?
- No, no, it's our third.

14
00:01:32,681 --> 00:01:34,239
Sir, can you sign here?

15
00:01:36,116 --> 00:01:39,107
We're gonna name her Jessica.

16
00:01:36,116 --> 00:01:39,107
We're gonna name her Jessica.

17
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:15,975
Where's John?

18
00:02:16,142 --> 00:02:18,609
- Where's my husband?
- Just relax now.

19
00:02:18,777 --> 00:02:20,210
Everything's gonna be okay.

20
00:02:26,916 --> 00:02:29,146
What's happening?
What are you doing?

21
00:02:29,318 --> 00:02:30,716
I'm so sorry for your loss.

22
00:02:30,886 --> 00:02:32,978
- What?
- Your baby's dead.

23
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:35,382
No, it's not dead. It's alive.

24
00:02:35,555 --> 00:02:37,455
What are you talking about?
It's moving.

25
00:02:37,624 --> 00:02:40,751
It's a terrible loss. We're so sorry.

26
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:44,393
- Just relax.
- No!

27
00:02:44,561 --> 00:02:47,427
What? No, no, no. Put me to sleep.
I wanna be asleep.

28
00:02:47,596 --> 00:02:50,928
- It's too late for that.
- No!

29
00:02:54,635 --> 00:02:56,158
It's okay, you're doing great.

30
00:02:57,036 --> 00:02:59,003
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

31
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:00,797
You might feel some tugging.

32
00:03:06,842 --> 00:03:09,469
Oh, my God. This isn't happening.

33
00:03:11,078 --> 00:03:14,569
Congratulations, Mrs. Coleman.
It's a girl.

34
00:04:30,196 --> 00:04:33,687
Yes, Kate, your dreams can be
a manifestation of your emotions.

35
00:04:33,865 --> 00:04:36,025
It's your body and mind's way
of dealing...

36
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,690
...with the stress and grief
of what happened.

37
00:04:38,868 --> 00:04:41,563
What if this has nothing to do
with the stillbirth?

38
00:04:41,737 --> 00:04:43,636
What do you think it's about?

39
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:48,240
We're seeing kids
for the first time this weekend.

40
00:04:48,408 --> 00:04:51,865
And maybe the nightmares...

41
00:04:55,613 --> 00:04:58,979
Maybe I'm just not ready to adopt yet.

42
00:05:04,819 --> 00:05:08,515
I drove by the wine shop
on the way home the other night.

43
00:05:10,022 --> 00:05:11,250
Did you stop?

44
00:05:11,423 --> 00:05:15,255
No. Wanted to. The thought
went through my brain, you know?

45
00:05:15,425 --> 00:05:17,359
It wasn't for myself. It wasn't...

46
00:05:17,527 --> 00:05:21,484
I just thought it would be nice to have
a bottle handy, in case we had guests.

47
00:05:21,663 --> 00:05:22,891
But you didn't go in.

48
00:05:25,532 --> 00:05:26,862
Mm-mm.

49
00:05:27,033 --> 00:05:29,057
The key, to me...

50
00:05:29,234 --> 00:05:31,668
...is not that you had the urge...

51
00:05:31,836 --> 00:05:33,497
...but that you resisted it.

52
00:05:33,671 --> 00:05:37,571
You wouldn't have made it through
the home study if you weren't ready.

53
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:39,207
But, ultimately...

54
00:05:39,375 --> 00:05:41,842
...you have to decide.

55
00:06:05,158 --> 00:06:06,749
Hi.

56
00:06:07,793 --> 00:06:10,955
Honey, hello.

57
00:06:11,162 --> 00:06:13,686
Let me see. Ooh. Did you paint this?

58
00:06:15,064 --> 00:06:18,692
It's a beautiful butterfly.
It's fantastic.

59
00:06:18,867 --> 00:06:20,959
Really wonderful. Good.

60
00:06:21,168 --> 00:06:24,159
Let's go. I'm cold.

61
00:06:52,922 --> 00:06:54,684
Are you okay?

62
00:08:13,641 --> 00:08:15,232
Ah!

63
00:08:20,278 --> 00:08:21,506
Max!

64
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,340
Max!

65
00:08:23,514 --> 00:08:25,209
Stop throwing!

66
00:08:25,382 --> 00:08:28,179
I'm working.

67
00:08:29,251 --> 00:08:30,513
No, honey, I'm sorry.

68
00:08:30,686 --> 00:08:33,210
Just take a break
for a little while, okay?

69
00:08:33,387 --> 00:08:36,446
Because Mommy's trying
to play. Okay?

70
00:08:40,759 --> 00:08:42,658
Daddy's here.

71
00:08:46,262 --> 00:08:47,695
- Mine.
- Hey.

72
00:08:48,764 --> 00:08:51,391
- Hi.
- Sorry, practice went a little late.

73
00:08:51,565 --> 00:08:54,032
- It's all right.
- Whoa.

74
00:08:54,834 --> 00:08:57,768
- Okay, tough guy. Give me that.
- Wicked.

75
00:08:59,138 --> 00:09:00,468
No, no.

76
00:09:00,638 --> 00:09:03,071
Shoot it, shoot it. Go, go, go, go.

77
00:09:03,273 --> 00:09:06,969
- No.
- Yes! Give me five.

78
00:09:07,143 --> 00:09:09,076
Hey, how did it go? Daniel.

79
00:09:09,277 --> 00:09:10,835
Fine.

80
00:09:15,815 --> 00:09:17,714
Hey.

81
00:09:18,717 --> 00:09:19,740
Okay.

82
00:09:19,917 --> 00:09:21,817
Five minutes. I'm at the last level.

83
00:09:21,986 --> 00:09:23,748
No more video games. Brush your teeth.

84
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,581
That's no fair. It won't save.
Come on, Dad, please?

85
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,581
That's no fair. It won't save.
Come on, Dad, please?

86
00:11:54,684 --> 00:11:57,083
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

87
00:11:57,253 --> 00:11:58,447
God.

88
00:12:03,824 --> 00:12:05,120
You smell good.

89
00:12:16,965 --> 00:12:18,523
Okay.

90
00:12:19,767 --> 00:12:21,791
All right.

91
00:12:25,404 --> 00:12:28,804
I have to stop being like this.

92
00:12:28,973 --> 00:12:30,667
I get it.

93
00:12:38,846 --> 00:12:42,804
I'm very excited, I'm happy.

94
00:12:43,182 --> 00:12:45,308
I get nervous.

95
00:12:46,184 --> 00:12:48,344
I'm really scared.

96
00:12:51,354 --> 00:12:56,346
Last time I felt all of this
was right before I lost the baby.

97
00:12:56,524 --> 00:13:00,050
I don't want you to feel like we have
to go through with this for my sake.

98
00:13:00,227 --> 00:13:03,559
It's not just... It's not for you.

99
00:13:03,729 --> 00:13:05,821
I wanna take the love
we felt for Jessica...

100
00:13:05,997 --> 00:13:09,955
...and I wanna give it to somebody
who really needs it.

101
00:13:13,335 --> 00:13:15,303
Are you sure, hon?

102
00:13:18,005 --> 00:13:19,665
Yes.

103
00:13:40,954 --> 00:13:43,820
- Wanna make a snowman?
- Sure.

104
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:45,387
It's really cold out here.

105
00:13:52,194 --> 00:13:53,820
Hey, stop it.

106
00:14:01,233 --> 00:14:02,927
- Hi.
- Hi.

107
00:14:03,101 --> 00:14:04,397
So glad you could make it.

108
00:14:04,568 --> 00:14:06,661
- So are we.
- Yeah, finally, right?

109
00:14:07,603 --> 00:14:10,833
- So good to see you.
- Thank you for coming.

110
00:14:12,207 --> 00:14:15,175
- This is really something.
- So go take a look around.

111
00:14:15,709 --> 00:14:18,269
- Stay out of trouble.
- Yeah, yeah.

112
00:14:21,679 --> 00:14:23,044
Look at the snow orphan.

113
00:14:23,214 --> 00:14:24,578
Snow orphan?

114
00:14:24,748 --> 00:14:27,215
Uh, snorphan?

115
00:14:37,357 --> 00:14:41,621
- Hey.
- No, show it to Sister Mary.

116
00:15:04,374 --> 00:15:07,774
- Slow down, slow down.
- You can't catch me.

117
00:15:07,943 --> 00:15:09,069
Yes, I can.

118
00:15:36,561 --> 00:15:38,289
Hello?

119
00:15:42,766 --> 00:15:44,255
Hi.

120
00:15:58,242 --> 00:16:00,073
Are all these paintings yours?

121
00:16:00,244 --> 00:16:03,973
- Yes. Do you like them?
- They're remarkable.

122
00:16:04,746 --> 00:16:06,145
Thank you.

123
00:16:06,314 --> 00:16:09,146
My name is Esther. What's yours?

124
00:16:09,749 --> 00:16:12,240
John. Nice to meet you.

125
00:16:13,619 --> 00:16:16,178
- Can I take a seat?
- Of course.

126
00:16:18,088 --> 00:16:21,181
I never get tired of watching
these kids enjoy the party.

127
00:16:21,357 --> 00:16:23,847
It really is. I'm so sorry
we didn't do this sooner.

128
00:16:24,059 --> 00:16:25,856
Don't be. It's a big leap.

129
00:16:26,061 --> 00:16:30,189
Adopting an older child
is not an easy decision to make.

130
00:16:31,764 --> 00:16:32,923
John's in the bathroom.

131
00:16:33,098 --> 00:16:35,463
Think he'll find us?
Do you wanna go look for him?

132
00:16:35,633 --> 00:16:40,467
- Where did you get the idea for this one?
- My paintings always tell stories.

133
00:16:40,637 --> 00:16:43,968
This one's about a sad mother lion
who can't find her cubs.

134
00:16:44,138 --> 00:16:47,573
- She's smiling.
- She's dreaming about her babies.

135
00:16:48,075 --> 00:16:50,008
It's the only thing
that makes her happy.

136
00:16:50,176 --> 00:16:54,578
- I hope she finds them.
- She will. Look.

137
00:16:57,781 --> 00:17:00,976
They were lost in the jungle,
and they were so scared...

138
00:17:01,149 --> 00:17:03,276
...because they didn't have a mother.

139
00:17:03,452 --> 00:17:05,851
Just when they thought
they'd be alone forever...

140
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:09,647
...they found their mother asleep
under this tree.

141
00:17:09,822 --> 00:17:13,313
Now when she wakes up,
her dream will have come true.

142
00:17:13,491 --> 00:17:17,017
- She'll have her family again.
- Amazing. You came up with that story?

143
00:17:17,194 --> 00:17:19,684
- I think I hear his voice down here.
- Yes.

144
00:17:20,995 --> 00:17:24,486
Hey. I want to introduce you.
This is my wife, Kate.

145
00:17:24,665 --> 00:17:26,030
Kate, this is Esther.

146
00:17:27,467 --> 00:17:28,832
Hello.

147
00:17:30,836 --> 00:17:33,668
How are you? Nice to meet you.

148
00:17:34,705 --> 00:17:36,968
She painted all these.

149
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:38,163
- Really?
- Yeah.

150
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:41,069
These are fantastic.
These are really wonderful.

151
00:17:41,242 --> 00:17:43,641
- Thank you.
- Where did you learn how to do this?

152
00:17:43,810 --> 00:17:47,006
I've just had lots of time to practice,
I guess.

153
00:17:47,179 --> 00:17:49,976
It's really boring here.

154
00:17:50,148 --> 00:17:52,138
It's boring here?

155
00:17:52,316 --> 00:17:54,977
If you're so bored,
why aren't you down at the party?

156
00:17:55,151 --> 00:17:59,814
I've never really seen the point of it.
Nobody's ever talked to me before.

157
00:18:00,754 --> 00:18:01,846
I guess I'm different.

158
00:18:02,022 --> 00:18:04,216
There's nothing wrong
with being different.

159
00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:06,357
Well, you two have a lot in common.

160
00:18:10,928 --> 00:18:12,861
I think people should always...

161
00:18:13,029 --> 00:18:15,496
...try to take the bad things
that happen to them...

162
00:18:15,664 --> 00:18:18,029
...and turn them into something good.

163
00:18:18,199 --> 00:18:20,996
- Don't you?
- Yeah.

164
00:18:21,168 --> 00:18:23,068
Absolutely.

165
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:33,231
She's originally from Russia, but
it's amazing how strong her English is.

166
00:18:33,409 --> 00:18:35,706
She's only been in the country
a few years.

167
00:18:35,878 --> 00:18:37,902
You get children from other countries?

168
00:18:38,079 --> 00:18:42,242
It's rare. But when we do,
it's sometimes difficult to place them.

169
00:18:42,782 --> 00:18:46,580
The family that brought her to America
died in a house fire.

170
00:18:46,751 --> 00:18:48,184
In a fire?

171
00:18:48,353 --> 00:18:49,751
My God.

172
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,444
Esther barely got out.

173
00:18:52,221 --> 00:18:56,748
She's been through a lot,
but this is an extraordinary little girl.

174
00:18:56,925 --> 00:18:59,893
She's very bright.
She's very mature for her age.

175
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:04,188
And she's very well-mannered.
She's a bit of a princess, actually.

176
00:19:04,363 --> 00:19:08,162
She wears those ribbons on her wrists
and her neck all the time.

177
00:19:08,798 --> 00:19:09,856
Mine too.

178
00:19:10,033 --> 00:19:12,796
We had trouble with her
when we tried to take them off.

179
00:19:12,968 --> 00:19:14,798
How does she get along
with other kids?

180
00:19:14,969 --> 00:19:17,233
Oh, when she has to interact,
she's great.

181
00:19:17,404 --> 00:19:19,531
Babe?

182
00:19:19,706 --> 00:19:22,902
- She really did seem to open up with us.
- Yeah.

183
00:19:23,074 --> 00:19:25,871
I thought she more
than opened up with you.

184
00:19:26,043 --> 00:19:28,136
You seem to have made
quite a connection.

185
00:19:28,312 --> 00:19:32,474
I could get the paperwork together
and see you back here in three weeks.

186
00:19:38,785 --> 00:19:40,479
All right.

187
00:19:50,393 --> 00:19:51,451
Okey-dokey.

188
00:19:51,626 --> 00:19:53,651
Call me if you need anything.

189
00:19:53,828 --> 00:19:55,590
Bye. Okay, thank you.

190
00:20:15,275 --> 00:20:17,765
Oh, that's T-H.

191
00:20:17,944 --> 00:20:20,571
T-H. Yeah.

192
00:20:20,745 --> 00:20:22,837
And "Max" is like this?

193
00:20:23,013 --> 00:20:24,071
Yeah.

194
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:26,940
Good.

195
00:20:31,286 --> 00:20:35,653
- Is this your house?
- Now it's your house too.

196
00:20:52,099 --> 00:20:55,966
Hi, sweetie. Hi. Look who's here.

197
00:21:01,005 --> 00:21:04,940
Hello, Max. My name is Esther.

198
00:21:05,507 --> 00:21:07,839
She's been practicing the whole way.

199
00:21:09,978 --> 00:21:12,002
- Can she hear?
- A little.

200
00:21:12,179 --> 00:21:13,976
She was born almost completely deaf.

201
00:21:14,146 --> 00:21:17,342
That just allows her to hear enough
to read lips.

202
00:21:20,884 --> 00:21:23,374
That's all right, I got it.

203
00:21:27,789 --> 00:21:30,222
I'd like to introduce you
to Grandma Barbara.

204
00:21:30,391 --> 00:21:33,052
It's a pleasure to meet you.

205
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:36,251
That's precious.
It's a pleasure to meet you too.

206
00:21:37,996 --> 00:21:39,895
Danny.

207
00:21:40,063 --> 00:21:42,258
This is Esther.

208
00:21:44,367 --> 00:21:45,560
Hello, Daniel.

209
00:21:46,768 --> 00:21:48,496
Hey.

210
00:21:52,138 --> 00:21:54,002
Why does she dress like that?

211
00:21:54,172 --> 00:21:57,334
- Come on. Stop it.
- I'm just asking a question.

212
00:21:57,508 --> 00:21:59,408
Oh!

213
00:22:00,176 --> 00:22:03,167
- You have a piano?
- Yeah.

214
00:22:03,345 --> 00:22:06,472
- Would you like to learn how to play?
- I would love to.

215
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:16,743
Do you like it?

216
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:19,081
- It's perfect.
- Good.

217
00:22:26,594 --> 00:22:27,856
Thank you.

218
00:22:28,029 --> 00:22:29,893
How do you say "thank you"?

219
00:22:30,397 --> 00:22:31,863
Thank you.

220
00:22:41,337 --> 00:22:44,066
Wow, look at that.

221
00:22:44,239 --> 00:22:47,230
What? What? What?

222
00:22:47,408 --> 00:22:48,669
Dad, look.

223
00:22:48,841 --> 00:22:50,365
- Dad.
- Where did you get that?

224
00:22:50,543 --> 00:22:53,534
- Dad, look, I'm killing Trevor.
- Great.

225
00:22:53,711 --> 00:22:55,201
Yes.

226
00:22:58,214 --> 00:22:59,510
Thank you.

227
00:22:59,682 --> 00:23:02,116
Come on, Dad. My solo's gonna end.
Hurry, look.

228
00:23:03,685 --> 00:23:05,618
Wow, cool.

229
00:23:10,456 --> 00:23:13,117
- Trevor, you suck.
- Shut up.

230
00:23:14,692 --> 00:23:17,091
That's fabulous.

231
00:23:17,727 --> 00:23:20,627
Come on, guys. This is lame.

232
00:23:20,829 --> 00:23:23,058
I was just about to beat you.

233
00:23:24,031 --> 00:23:26,362
I'm glad you like it, honey.

234
00:23:43,610 --> 00:23:44,872
Come on, guys.

235
00:23:50,382 --> 00:23:52,713
Hurry up, I'm freezing my ass off.

236
00:23:52,883 --> 00:23:57,614
- Dude, it's all in here.
- Oh, God. My hands are freezing.

237
00:23:58,420 --> 00:23:59,886
Oh, man, she's hot.

238
00:24:00,388 --> 00:24:03,379
- Move over, man.
- Page 34 will change your life.

239
00:24:04,791 --> 00:24:06,587
Whoa.

240
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,054
This looks like your mom.

241
00:24:11,462 --> 00:24:12,793
No.

242
00:24:17,466 --> 00:24:19,763
Esther and Maxine seem to be 
getting along well.

243
00:24:19,934 --> 00:24:21,128
Yeah.

244
00:24:21,302 --> 00:24:22,996
How's she doing, Kate?

245
00:24:23,169 --> 00:24:25,500
Esther's fitting right in.

246
00:24:25,671 --> 00:24:27,298
I meant Maxine.

247
00:24:27,473 --> 00:24:30,100
She's playing by the pond
like nothing ever happened.

248
00:24:30,274 --> 00:24:31,934
She doesn't remember, does she?

249
00:24:32,109 --> 00:24:34,508
No. She's fine.

250
00:24:39,413 --> 00:24:43,075
So, what are your plans?

251
00:24:43,249 --> 00:24:46,274
You know,probably get Esther settled...

252
00:24:47,119 --> 00:24:49,086
...then go back to teaching.

253
00:24:49,253 --> 00:24:51,186
Thought they weren't gonna
take you back.

254
00:24:51,388 --> 00:24:52,855
No, I'm not talking about Yale.

255
00:24:53,022 --> 00:24:56,114
I'll just... I'll probably give lessons
from home.

256
00:24:56,290 --> 00:24:58,656
That's too bad.
That was a very good job.

257
00:24:58,826 --> 00:25:00,793
Well, I didn't quit because I wanted to.

258
00:25:00,961 --> 00:25:04,123
I know.
You had to have your moment of clarity.

259
00:25:04,296 --> 00:25:06,820
That is an A.A. term.

260
00:25:07,598 --> 00:25:09,862
And I didn't go to A.A.
I just stopped drinking.

261
00:25:10,033 --> 00:25:13,626
Same difference.
We all need a wake-up call sometimes.

262
00:26:20,746 --> 00:26:22,337
Hi.

263
00:26:23,247 --> 00:26:26,340
- Hi.
- Come here.

264
00:26:44,461 --> 00:26:46,088
Yeah?

265
00:26:47,863 --> 00:26:51,161
- Oh, hey.
- We're scared of the lightning.

266
00:26:51,332 --> 00:26:53,026
Oh, come in.

267
00:26:53,834 --> 00:26:58,826
- I wanna sleep next to Daddy.
- Hang on.

268
00:27:00,071 --> 00:27:01,867
Okay.

269
00:27:10,811 --> 00:27:13,176
I'm gonna call later,
make sure everything's okay.

270
00:27:13,346 --> 00:27:15,541
Okay. They're gonna love your design.

271
00:27:15,714 --> 00:27:17,579
- You gonna pick up the phone?
- Yeah.

272
00:27:17,749 --> 00:27:19,340
All right.

273
00:27:20,218 --> 00:27:22,048
Esther?

274
00:27:22,219 --> 00:27:23,914
Esther?

275
00:27:24,087 --> 00:27:25,781
Come on.

276
00:27:25,988 --> 00:27:29,423
Esther, come on, we gotta go!

277
00:27:29,591 --> 00:27:32,888
You gotta be kidding me.

278
00:27:33,192 --> 00:27:36,388
Wow. Uh...

279
00:27:37,195 --> 00:27:39,492
- Will you please go wait in the car?
- Come on.

280
00:27:43,366 --> 00:27:45,959
Sweetheart,this isn't really 
a school dress.

281
00:27:46,134 --> 00:27:48,693
But I like it.
Don't you think it's pretty?

282
00:27:48,870 --> 00:27:50,461
Yes, it's so beautiful...

283
00:27:50,637 --> 00:27:53,730
...but I just don't think
you're gonna be comfortable in it.

284
00:27:53,906 --> 00:27:55,032
What about those jeans?

285
00:27:55,207 --> 00:27:58,073
You're afraid the other children
will laugh at me.

286
00:27:58,243 --> 00:28:02,701
I thought you said there wasn't
anything wrong with being different.

287
00:28:04,079 --> 00:28:06,411
Yes, you're right.
You're absolutely right.

288
00:28:06,581 --> 00:28:09,276
Okay. Have fun.

289
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:13,309
Take a seat, please. Take a seat.

290
00:28:13,519 --> 00:28:15,645
Don't make me ask again, please.

291
00:28:16,587 --> 00:28:19,646
Okay, this is our new student.
Her name's Esther Coleman.

292
00:28:19,823 --> 00:28:22,950
And I'd like you all
to make her feel very welcome today.

293
00:28:23,125 --> 00:28:26,560
Oh, look. Little Bo Peep texted me.
She wants her outfit back.

294
00:28:30,263 --> 00:28:31,958
Okay, go take a seat.

295
00:28:33,798 --> 00:28:36,664
Okay, if everybody could turn
to Page 27...

296
00:28:41,570 --> 00:28:42,628
No!

297
00:28:42,804 --> 00:28:45,067
No! Esther, what are you doing?

298
00:28:45,239 --> 00:28:48,071
Get away from there! No!

299
00:28:48,241 --> 00:28:52,108
You don't play near the water!
You know that!

300
00:28:52,278 --> 00:28:53,574
Come on, get out!

301
00:28:55,146 --> 00:28:56,806
Max.

302
00:29:14,158 --> 00:29:16,819
Sweet. Bull's-eye.

303
00:29:18,294 --> 00:29:19,420
Got you.

304
00:29:52,950 --> 00:29:56,282
- Did you kill it?
- I didn't think it would hurt him.

305
00:30:05,992 --> 00:30:07,458
Put it out of its misery.

306
00:30:09,127 --> 00:30:13,562
- It's in pain, and it's your responsibility.
- It was just an accident.

307
00:30:13,730 --> 00:30:16,061
If you walk away now,
it'll starve to death.

308
00:30:16,231 --> 00:30:17,788
Is that what you want?

309
00:30:22,836 --> 00:30:24,826
I'm not doing it.

310
00:30:30,841 --> 00:30:32,740
It's all right.

311
00:30:32,909 --> 00:30:35,638
- It's in heaven now.
- What's wrong with you?

312
00:30:43,482 --> 00:30:45,712
- Is the water warm enough?
- Yes, thank you.

313
00:30:45,884 --> 00:30:48,113
Okay. Call me if you need anything.

314
00:31:06,131 --> 00:31:07,893
Esther?

315
00:31:08,733 --> 00:31:10,666
Esther.

316
00:31:11,368 --> 00:31:12,834
Open this door.

317
00:31:16,738 --> 00:31:19,331
- What are you doing?
- I always lock the door.

318
00:31:19,506 --> 00:31:21,336
No, we don't lock doors in this house.

319
00:31:21,507 --> 00:31:23,565
But what if someone comes in
and sees me?

320
00:31:24,376 --> 00:31:25,502
Nobody's gonna come in.

321
00:31:25,677 --> 00:31:28,702
Look, I'm gonna stand right here,
if that's what you want.

322
00:31:28,879 --> 00:31:30,402
I could sing for you.

323
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:34,912
I used to sing for the sisters
so they would know I was all right.

324
00:31:37,418 --> 00:31:39,180
Okay.

325
00:31:39,686 --> 00:31:43,143
All right. But you know what?
This is just for tonight.

326
00:33:28,823 --> 00:33:32,656
Your parents must have gone
to a lot of retard camps to find her.

327
00:33:34,526 --> 00:33:36,153
Watch it.

328
00:33:37,528 --> 00:33:39,120
Are you okay?

329
00:33:44,734 --> 00:33:46,291
Is this a Bible?

330
00:33:48,336 --> 00:33:51,997
Jesus Freak brought a Bible
to school today.

331
00:33:56,742 --> 00:33:58,106
Hey, wanna come over?

332
00:34:04,246 --> 00:34:06,839
- Good one.
- Your sister's a total spaz.

333
00:34:07,014 --> 00:34:08,503
She's not my sister.

334
00:34:10,817 --> 00:34:12,613
I can't believe you did that.

335
00:34:12,785 --> 00:34:16,481
Oh, little doggy.
Is this your collar, little doggy?

336
00:34:32,331 --> 00:34:36,391
Not A. A, B.

337
00:34:42,570 --> 00:34:44,162
You did really good.

338
00:34:44,339 --> 00:34:48,364
No, I didn't. I made like 11 mistakes.

339
00:34:49,776 --> 00:34:51,299
I'll do better next time.

340
00:34:52,010 --> 00:34:54,876
Your teacher told me
what happened today.

341
00:34:56,514 --> 00:34:59,038
Don't you want to talk about it?

342
00:34:59,215 --> 00:35:01,409
There's nothing to talk about.

343
00:35:02,017 --> 00:35:04,917
You know I'm here for you, right?
You know that, right?

344
00:35:06,153 --> 00:35:08,916
I got something I wanna show you.

345
00:35:13,591 --> 00:35:15,888
I have one just like this
that I use as a diary.

346
00:35:16,059 --> 00:35:19,925
And I thought that maybe you
and I could use this one...

347
00:35:20,095 --> 00:35:21,722
...for a scrapbook.

348
00:35:23,097 --> 00:35:25,587
That's Mommy and Daddy
on their wedding day.

349
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,433
That's Daniel, Christmas morning.

350
00:35:30,669 --> 00:35:32,568
Here's Max.

351
00:35:35,305 --> 00:35:36,533
And there's you.

352
00:35:42,110 --> 00:35:44,168
Who's Jessica?

353
00:35:45,411 --> 00:35:48,106
Max talks about her.

354
00:35:48,947 --> 00:35:51,938
"I never held you, but I feel you.

355
00:35:52,116 --> 00:35:55,881
You never spoke, but I hear you.

356
00:35:57,252 --> 00:36:02,052
I never knew you, but I love you."

357
00:36:07,393 --> 00:36:09,019
What happened to her?

358
00:36:11,862 --> 00:36:14,421
She died
while she was still in my tummy.

359
00:36:15,531 --> 00:36:17,691
But we scattered her ashes here.

360
00:36:18,266 --> 00:36:21,701
And as long as this plant grows...

361
00:36:21,869 --> 00:36:26,566
...then part of her
will be alive inside it.

362
00:36:34,577 --> 00:36:37,238
She would have been lucky.

363
00:36:37,412 --> 00:36:39,242
You're a great mommy.

364
00:36:45,917 --> 00:36:47,475
Thank you, sweetheart.

365
00:36:47,652 --> 00:36:50,415
Thank you. It means a lot.

366
00:36:54,389 --> 00:36:57,050
- How are you?
- I'm good.

367
00:36:57,225 --> 00:37:01,558
It's very interesting.
Esther started to open up today.

368
00:37:01,728 --> 00:37:02,921
That's very interesting.

369
00:37:03,095 --> 00:37:05,585
I'm starting to feel like 
there's a real connection.

370
00:37:05,763 --> 00:37:07,787
Me too.

371
00:37:10,666 --> 00:37:12,793
- No, honey, not here.
- Shh.

372
00:37:12,969 --> 00:37:14,458
They're sleeping.

373
00:37:14,636 --> 00:37:18,503
Baby, come here,
you'll like it, believe me.

374
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:27,306
- Okay, let's get down to business.
- No, no, no.

375
00:37:27,478 --> 00:37:30,502
Okay, just for a second, then.

376
00:37:30,679 --> 00:37:32,306
Yeah.

377
00:37:41,654 --> 00:37:43,245
- No, no, no.
- Come on.

378
00:37:43,421 --> 00:37:46,685
I have to. Wait, wait, wait.

379
00:37:54,295 --> 00:37:56,125
Yeah.

380
00:38:23,147 --> 00:38:25,137
- Ow!
- Oh, sorry.

381
00:38:40,191 --> 00:38:43,023
Oh, Jesus.

382
00:38:43,661 --> 00:38:46,823
Jesus, honey. Damn it.

383
00:38:52,733 --> 00:38:54,427
Esther?

384
00:38:55,835 --> 00:38:58,166
We have to talk about last night.

385
00:38:58,337 --> 00:39:01,169
- Do we?
- Yes, we do.

386
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:06,369
See, there are certain things
that grown-ups do...

387
00:39:06,542 --> 00:39:09,635
...that children aren't supposed to see.

388
00:39:09,811 --> 00:39:13,836
And that was one of them.

389
00:39:18,050 --> 00:39:20,210
Esther, listen to me.

390
00:39:24,553 --> 00:39:27,715
When grown-ups love each other
very, very much...

391
00:39:28,990 --> 00:39:31,685
...they wanna show each other
that love. Express it.

392
00:39:31,858 --> 00:39:33,154
I know. They fuck.

393
00:39:37,395 --> 00:39:40,090
She could've picked it up anywhere.
Probably at school.

394
00:39:40,264 --> 00:39:43,994
This wasn't something she overheard.
I mean, she knew what it meant.

395
00:39:44,167 --> 00:39:45,360
Huh.

396
00:39:45,534 --> 00:39:47,694
And, babe,
the way she said it is...

397
00:39:47,868 --> 00:39:51,701
I don't even think she expected
to get in trouble over it.

398
00:39:52,871 --> 00:39:56,465
Well, we'll talk to her about it tonight.

399
00:39:57,842 --> 00:39:59,399
Fine.

400
00:39:59,576 --> 00:40:01,600
Well, what did you have in mind?

401
00:40:02,278 --> 00:40:05,246
No, I thought we could take her
to Dr. Browning.

402
00:40:06,014 --> 00:40:08,880
I don't think we need to take her
to the shrink quite yet.

403
00:40:09,049 --> 00:40:12,506
Well, you know,
we just don't know that much about her.

404
00:40:12,685 --> 00:40:15,050
The family she stayed with
could've been like:

405
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:19,177
"Pass the fucking potatoes"
at dinnertime, you know?

406
00:40:19,356 --> 00:40:22,756
If she's saying it to my face, what
is she saying when we're not there?

407
00:40:22,925 --> 00:40:26,052
I don't want her exerting
that kind of influence over Max.

408
00:40:27,227 --> 00:40:32,596
Anyway, I just don't want to make
a big deal out of one little dirty word.

409
00:40:33,631 --> 00:40:36,861
Fine. Fucking spend some time
with her, then.

410
00:40:37,034 --> 00:40:38,228
All right, bitch.

411
00:40:42,604 --> 00:40:45,037
Let's have a snow fight!

412
00:40:45,906 --> 00:40:48,499
Come on, no throwing snowballs.

413
00:40:59,048 --> 00:41:00,072
Hey, neighbor.

414
00:41:02,150 --> 00:41:05,550
- Hey.
- Haven't seen you around lately.

415
00:41:05,719 --> 00:41:07,549
JOHN:
I've been pretty busy.

416
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:10,779
Has the homeowners' association
been soldiering on without me?

417
00:41:10,956 --> 00:41:12,889
It's not the same.

418
00:41:25,565 --> 00:41:28,931
Um, actually, I had a favor to ask.

419
00:41:29,101 --> 00:41:31,830
I have a chair
that I need moved upstairs...

420
00:41:32,037 --> 00:41:37,063
...and I was hoping you could come by
and help me with that sometime.

421
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:39,306
Yeah.

422
00:41:39,474 --> 00:41:41,270
- Yeah, sure.
- Good.

423
00:41:41,442 --> 00:41:44,410
Maybe Kate and I could help you out.
Just let us know.

424
00:41:44,577 --> 00:41:46,169
I'll call you.

425
00:41:46,346 --> 00:41:48,279
Let's go, honey.

426
00:41:50,615 --> 00:41:53,174
Okay, I'm watching you.

427
00:44:06,736 --> 00:44:10,899
Brenda's father says
that you pushed her.

428
00:44:11,073 --> 00:44:12,562
That's not true.

429
00:44:12,740 --> 00:44:14,230
We were just playing.

430
00:44:14,408 --> 00:44:16,568
I swear.

431
00:44:17,910 --> 00:44:20,174
- Okay.
- And did you see what happened?

432
00:44:54,901 --> 00:44:57,131
What? Mom, what's she saying?

433
00:44:57,303 --> 00:44:59,930
She wants you to pass the bread
and butter.

434
00:45:01,872 --> 00:45:04,533
- Wasn't asking you.
- Hey, now.

435
00:45:14,547 --> 00:45:16,572
Can you eat normal?

436
00:45:17,749 --> 00:45:19,239
I am eating normal.

437
00:45:19,417 --> 00:45:22,408
Yeah, maybe in Transylvania,
or whatever country you're from.

438
00:45:22,586 --> 00:45:24,610
Incidentally, I'm from Russia.

439
00:45:24,787 --> 00:45:29,245
Transylvania isn't even a country.
It's a part of Romania.

440
00:45:29,423 --> 00:45:30,788
You are such a freak.

441
00:45:30,958 --> 00:45:32,822
- Hey.
- Hey, Danny.

442
00:45:32,992 --> 00:45:34,822
I don't want any more talk like that.

443
00:45:34,993 --> 00:45:37,460
But why does she have to act
like that?

444
00:45:37,628 --> 00:45:39,789
All my friends make fun of me
because of her.

445
00:45:39,964 --> 00:45:41,726
Maybe you need different friends.

446
00:45:41,898 --> 00:45:44,832
Maybe you should send her back
to the retard camp.

447
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,626
- Daniel.
- Daniel.

448
00:45:46,801 --> 00:45:48,325
Apologize to your sister.

449
00:45:48,503 --> 00:45:52,232
She's not my fucking sister.

450
00:45:54,906 --> 00:45:56,203
I got it.

451
00:45:58,309 --> 00:46:00,003
Okay.

452
00:46:02,579 --> 00:46:03,602
That's me.

453
00:46:21,657 --> 00:46:23,920
You get the key back
when you say you're sorry.

454
00:46:30,296 --> 00:46:33,321
Is there anything special
you want me to make tonight?

455
00:46:33,498 --> 00:46:34,987
You have any favorites?

456
00:46:38,969 --> 00:46:40,265
Hello.

457
00:46:40,436 --> 00:46:43,802
- Well, how are you?
- Hi, we're great. We're doing good.

458
00:46:43,972 --> 00:46:45,802
- How is she?
- She's here, hold on.

459
00:46:45,973 --> 00:46:48,702
Hey, Sister Abigail.
Do you wanna say hello?

460
00:46:48,874 --> 00:46:52,866
- Come on. Esther, just quickly say hi.
- I said, no.

461
00:46:56,513 --> 00:47:01,642
You know what, do you mind, darling,
can you get five apples for me?

462
00:47:02,284 --> 00:47:04,979
Sorry, she got shy all of a sudden.

463
00:47:05,152 --> 00:47:07,551
It's all right.
I'm just calling to remind you...

464
00:47:07,754 --> 00:47:09,983
...that I'm gonna need her medical...

465
00:47:10,155 --> 00:47:12,850
...and dental charts
for my supervision report.

466
00:47:16,627 --> 00:47:18,560
She's not thrilled about the dentist.

467
00:47:23,130 --> 00:47:25,620
How is everyone doing?
Is she opening up to you?

468
00:47:25,798 --> 00:47:29,255
I guess you can say that. She dropped
the F-bomb on me a few weeks ago.

469
00:47:32,303 --> 00:47:33,997
I guess she's finally
coming out of her shell.

470
00:47:35,572 --> 00:47:37,232
Yeah.

471
00:47:37,406 --> 00:47:39,169
Any other glitches I should know of?

472
00:47:39,341 --> 00:47:40,864
We had a big one recently.

473
00:47:41,042 --> 00:47:43,066
It's a girl named Brenda at school.

474
00:47:45,411 --> 00:47:48,811
They were at the playground,
there was a slide, well, she fell off.

475
00:47:48,980 --> 00:47:52,244
Esther may have pushed her down.

476
00:47:52,416 --> 00:47:55,009
I'm not getting the story straight,
but she got hurt.

477
00:47:55,184 --> 00:47:56,208
Is she all right?

478
00:47:56,386 --> 00:47:59,581
Luckily. She broke her ankle
and had something like six stitches.

479
00:47:59,787 --> 00:48:01,379
That doesn't sound too lucky.

480
00:48:01,555 --> 00:48:03,886
Well, she's lucky
she didn't break her neck.

481
00:48:33,576 --> 00:48:36,271
You told me you didn't 
know how to play.

482
00:48:36,445 --> 00:48:39,038
- No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did.

483
00:48:39,213 --> 00:48:42,113
You offered to teach me
and I accepted.

484
00:48:42,315 --> 00:48:47,718
Okay. So then you were
just pretending this whole time?

485
00:48:47,886 --> 00:48:49,853
I thought you would 
enjoy teaching me.

486
00:48:50,020 --> 00:48:53,920
It must be frustrating for someone
who loves music as much as you...

487
00:48:54,089 --> 00:48:57,922
...to have a son who isn't interested
and a daughter who can't even hear.

488
00:49:03,262 --> 00:49:05,354
Wait, wait, wait.

489
00:49:07,765 --> 00:49:10,392
I walk in on her playing Tchaikovsky
without a mistake.

490
00:49:10,567 --> 00:49:12,864
I mean, she's been lying to me
this whole time.

491
00:49:13,035 --> 00:49:15,901
She just wants to spend time
with you. It's hardly a lie.

492
00:49:16,071 --> 00:49:17,094
You wouldn't know.

493
00:49:17,271 --> 00:49:19,864
You wouldn't.
She's on her best behavior with you.

494
00:49:20,039 --> 00:49:23,098
She's completely different with me.

495
00:49:23,275 --> 00:49:25,037
So, what are you saying?

496
00:49:25,209 --> 00:49:27,575
I don't know.
She threw a fit at school.

497
00:49:27,745 --> 00:49:29,541
She pushed Brenda at the playground.

498
00:49:29,713 --> 00:49:33,613
- Now you're saying that was her fault?
- I don't know. Honey, I don't know.

499
00:49:33,781 --> 00:49:36,079
I wasn't there.
You were watching them.

500
00:49:36,250 --> 00:49:39,809
Oh, come on. It was an accident.

501
00:49:39,985 --> 00:49:43,215
Okay, let's not blame her
for anything, fine.

502
00:49:43,388 --> 00:49:45,048
I'll take her word for everything.

503
00:49:45,222 --> 00:49:48,315
Should I just believe what she said
about you and Joyce too?

504
00:49:48,491 --> 00:49:50,425
What did she say?

505
00:49:51,293 --> 00:49:55,160
- She says that you were hitting on her.
- What?

506
00:49:55,363 --> 00:49:58,957
Oh, come on. She must've
misunderstood. It was, like...

507
00:49:59,131 --> 00:50:00,462
Did she invite you over?

508
00:50:00,632 --> 00:50:03,794
She asked me
to help her move a chair.

509
00:50:03,968 --> 00:50:07,993
- She did?
- Yeah. I blew her off.

510
00:50:08,170 --> 00:50:10,569
Oh, God.

511
00:50:10,739 --> 00:50:11,933
Why didn't you tell me?

512
00:50:12,107 --> 00:50:13,937
- l...
- We could've laughed about it.

513
00:50:14,108 --> 00:50:15,905
- No, I knew how...
- You were hiding it.

514
00:50:16,076 --> 00:50:18,475
Honey, I knew how you'd react.

515
00:50:18,644 --> 00:50:20,838
Kate. Kate.

516
00:50:21,012 --> 00:50:23,844
You can't get jealous of every woman
that I talk to, right?

517
00:50:24,014 --> 00:50:26,345
- It's been like 10 years.
- What does that mean?

518
00:50:26,516 --> 00:50:28,676
You say that like it 
actually means something.

519
00:50:28,884 --> 00:50:31,249
It's only been two years
since you told me.

520
00:50:31,419 --> 00:50:36,286
You know how sorry I am. I just feel
like I've earned a little trust here.

521
00:50:36,455 --> 00:50:40,151
- I gave you a second chance.
- That's not fair. That's not fair.

522
00:50:40,325 --> 00:50:43,521
Let me get this straight. We can talk
about my mistakes, not yours?

523
00:50:43,694 --> 00:50:47,185
I was sick! You were an asshole
who wanted to fuck somebody else!

524
00:50:47,397 --> 00:50:49,694
You put our child's life in danger.

525
00:50:49,898 --> 00:50:52,866
I could've walked away months ago.
Nobody would've blamed me.

526
00:50:53,033 --> 00:50:57,491
Oh, that's sharp. That's sharp. Where
did you get that from, your mother?

527
00:51:11,211 --> 00:51:14,873
Danny. Turn that crap down, please,
I gotta work.

528
00:51:15,047 --> 00:51:16,104
- Fine.
- Thank you.

529
00:51:20,985 --> 00:51:22,679
I'll get it.

530
00:51:28,189 --> 00:51:31,715
- Hello, Esther.
- What are you doing here?

531
00:51:31,925 --> 00:51:33,983
May I come in?

532
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:37,526
I'm afraid I may have made a mistake.

533
00:51:37,695 --> 00:51:39,821
There could be something wrong
with Esther.

534
00:51:39,997 --> 00:51:41,191
What?

535
00:51:41,365 --> 00:51:44,457
What? You told us that you'd never
had any trouble with her.

536
00:51:44,633 --> 00:51:47,897
I didn't. But trouble does have a way
of finding her.

537
00:51:48,068 --> 00:51:49,126
What kind of trouble?

538
00:51:50,637 --> 00:51:52,832
Two girls get into a fight, there she is.

539
00:51:53,005 --> 00:51:55,667
Someone gets caught stealing,
there she is again.

540
00:51:55,840 --> 00:51:58,035
- So? Does that mean...?
- Just let her finish.

541
00:51:58,209 --> 00:52:02,473
After you told me about the girl in
the playground, I called her old school.

542
00:52:02,645 --> 00:52:05,078
While she was there,
there was a boy...

543
00:52:05,246 --> 00:52:07,213
...who fell with scissors in his hand...

544
00:52:07,381 --> 00:52:10,009
...and accidentally stabbed himself
through the jaw.

545
00:52:10,183 --> 00:52:11,673
And Esther was there again.

546
00:52:11,851 --> 00:52:15,217
I don't understand.
He accidentally stabbed himself.

547
00:52:15,853 --> 00:52:18,821
But the most troubling thing
is the Sullivan house fire.

548
00:52:18,988 --> 00:52:22,013
I checked into it further. It was arson.

549
00:52:23,058 --> 00:52:25,423
They have never found the person
who did it.

550
00:52:25,593 --> 00:52:27,583
What are you suggesting here?

551
00:52:27,761 --> 00:52:30,092
That she had anything to do
with any of this?

552
00:52:30,262 --> 00:52:31,559
It's ridiculous.

553
00:52:31,730 --> 00:52:33,720
That a child could commit such crimes...

554
00:52:33,898 --> 00:52:35,762
...it flies in the face
of everything I believe.

555
00:52:35,966 --> 00:52:37,399
Well, yeah.

556
00:52:42,504 --> 00:52:46,906
There's a mean lady here.
She's come to take me away.

557
00:52:47,073 --> 00:52:49,041
Will you help me?

558
00:52:49,209 --> 00:52:52,836
We've had some behavioral 
problems, but...

559
00:52:53,010 --> 00:52:55,671
Yeah, nothing like that. I mean, right?

560
00:52:55,846 --> 00:52:58,541
- Yes, we have.
- Really, hon, think about it.

561
00:52:58,714 --> 00:53:02,410
I've tried to reach the Russian
orphanage where she was raised.

562
00:53:02,584 --> 00:53:05,177
I think we need to know
what we're dealing with.

563
00:53:05,352 --> 00:53:07,842
Well, I'll tell you
what we're dealing with.

564
00:53:08,020 --> 00:53:10,078
- No, you know what?
- Stop it. Listen.

565
00:53:10,255 --> 00:53:13,417
We're dealing with a 9-year-old girl
who's an orphan, okay?

566
00:53:13,591 --> 00:53:17,617
- We're taking her to Dr. Browning.
- We can take her to Dr. Browning.

567
00:54:15,031 --> 00:54:16,622
Do you want to play?

568
00:54:23,903 --> 00:54:26,565
I'll call you as soon as 
I find anything else out.

569
00:54:26,738 --> 00:54:29,298
- Right. Take care.
- Okay. Thank you very much.

570
00:54:29,474 --> 00:54:31,134
Maybe later.

571
00:54:52,088 --> 00:54:53,111
It's going to be fine.

572
00:54:53,289 --> 00:54:56,621
We'll scare her so bad
she'll never come back here.

573
00:55:04,930 --> 00:55:05,954
Here she comes.

574
00:55:06,131 --> 00:55:08,155
Wave your arms and make her stop.

575
00:55:08,332 --> 00:55:09,559
Max, go.

576
00:55:39,185 --> 00:55:41,880
You all right? Max?

577
00:55:42,087 --> 00:55:43,815
Max?

578
00:55:44,388 --> 00:55:45,446
You okay?

579
00:55:58,898 --> 00:56:00,888
Stop crying.

580
00:56:01,099 --> 00:56:05,558
Grab a foot and help me 
get her off the road.

581
00:56:05,736 --> 00:56:07,327
Now.

582
00:57:16,281 --> 00:57:19,681
Help me hide her.

583
00:57:57,975 --> 00:57:59,465
That doesn't matter.

584
00:57:59,677 --> 00:58:03,236
They'll send you to jail
just for helping me hide her.

585
00:58:03,412 --> 00:58:07,245
I had to kill her because she 
was going to tell on me.

586
00:58:08,782 --> 00:58:13,741
You're not going to tell on me.
Are you?

587
00:58:23,124 --> 00:58:24,421
Don't worry.

588
00:58:24,592 --> 00:58:26,752
You're my little sister.

589
00:58:26,927 --> 00:58:30,054
I won't let anything happen to you.

590
00:58:30,229 --> 00:58:31,718
I love you.

591
00:59:42,243 --> 00:59:44,472
Tell me what you saw.

592
00:59:44,644 --> 00:59:47,441
- What are you doing?
- What did you see?

593
00:59:47,613 --> 00:59:49,773
I saw you and Max in the tree house.

594
00:59:49,948 --> 00:59:51,346
What else?

595
00:59:51,515 --> 00:59:53,847
- What do you mean?
- What else did you see?

596
00:59:54,017 --> 00:59:55,677
I didn't see anything. I swear.

597
00:59:55,852 --> 00:59:57,785
- Did you tell anyone?
- No.

598
00:59:58,620 --> 00:59:59,950
I didn't tell anyone.

599
01:00:01,622 --> 01:00:02,781
Please...

600
01:00:02,956 --> 01:00:07,016
If I find out that you're lying,
I'll cut your hairless little prick off...

601
01:00:07,192 --> 01:00:09,989
...before you even figure out
what it's for.

602
01:00:11,028 --> 01:00:13,962
- Do you understand me?
- Yes.

603
01:00:17,365 --> 01:00:18,992
You pissed yourself.

604
01:00:30,740 --> 01:00:33,207
It was nice talking to you, Alice.
I hope we can be friends.

605
01:00:33,375 --> 01:00:35,399
I'd like that.

606
01:00:36,311 --> 01:00:39,177
- We'll be right out, honey.
- You can come on in.

607
01:00:46,817 --> 01:00:49,842
My initial instinct is that...

608
01:00:50,019 --> 01:00:53,818
...there's not a deeply-rooted problem
in Esther's past.

609
01:00:54,522 --> 01:00:58,548
- So there's nothing wrong with her?
- No.

610
01:01:01,727 --> 01:01:04,593
It's not all good news.
I think what needs to be examined...

611
01:01:04,796 --> 01:01:08,321
...is Esther's relationship
with those around her.

612
01:01:11,319 --> 01:01:13,014
Specifically with you, Kate.

613
01:01:13,187 --> 01:01:16,985
It seems she feels there's been some
real tension between the two of you.

614
01:01:17,156 --> 01:01:20,318
- Okay.
- She's doing her best to please you...

615
01:01:20,491 --> 01:01:22,924
...but you're blocking her attempts
to bond.

616
01:01:24,428 --> 01:01:28,726
That's not true. That's not true at all.
I've done everything.

617
01:01:28,897 --> 01:01:31,592
- Right?
- Just let her finish.

618
01:01:31,765 --> 01:01:34,665
Something's happening
to cause Esther to feel this way.

619
01:01:34,834 --> 01:01:39,202
Perhaps it's your guilt about drinking
or what happened to Max.

620
01:01:39,371 --> 01:01:42,066
Maybe some of your feelings
of inadequacy as a mother...

621
01:01:42,238 --> 01:01:45,570
...are manifesting themselves
in your relationship with Esther.

622
01:01:45,741 --> 01:01:47,902
I don't feel inadequate.

623
01:01:51,244 --> 01:01:52,939
What did she tell you?

624
01:01:53,146 --> 01:01:56,239
She didn't see. She doesn't know.

625
01:01:57,449 --> 01:01:59,507
She's so stupid.

626
01:01:59,683 --> 01:02:03,345
Esther's a very shy, reserved...

627
01:02:03,519 --> 01:02:07,147
...sensitive little girl going through
an extremely difficult time.

628
01:02:13,859 --> 01:02:17,350
She's exceptionally bright
and highly articulate.

629
01:02:20,430 --> 01:02:23,796
She just needs a little patience
and understanding.

630
01:02:41,811 --> 01:02:43,903
Thanks for your support back there.

631
01:02:44,813 --> 01:02:47,042
That was your idea.

632
01:02:50,417 --> 01:02:52,384
Kate, wait, wait, wait.

633
01:02:52,551 --> 01:02:55,883
I'm not a psychiatrist,
but a lot of what she said made sense.

634
01:02:56,054 --> 01:02:57,953
Do you wanna get that?

635
01:03:02,124 --> 01:03:04,285
- Hello?
- Hello, is this Mrs. Coleman?

636
01:03:04,459 --> 01:03:05,550
Yes. Who's this?

637
01:03:05,726 --> 01:03:07,659
This is Sister Judith
from St. Mariana's.

638
01:03:07,827 --> 01:03:09,988
I'm sorry to bother you,
but I need to know...

639
01:03:10,196 --> 01:03:13,062
...if Sister Abigail
made it to her appointment with you.

640
01:03:13,232 --> 01:03:15,392
Yes. Why?

641
01:03:15,566 --> 01:03:17,430
She hasn't returned since yesterday...

642
01:03:17,601 --> 01:03:20,694
... and I'm just starting
to get really worried.

643
01:03:31,243 --> 01:03:33,642
Charlie 24, you wanna hold them there?

644
01:03:38,848 --> 01:03:40,439
Hey.

645
01:03:46,520 --> 01:03:48,453
Okay, I think we're done.

646
01:03:49,989 --> 01:03:53,445
Detective, do you have any leads
or suspects?

647
01:03:53,624 --> 01:03:57,457
- No, not yet.
- I just don't understand...

648
01:03:57,627 --> 01:04:00,151
...this kind of thing.
Who would do this? It's...

649
01:04:00,328 --> 01:04:01,352
Awful.

650
01:04:01,530 --> 01:04:03,827
You think of anything else,
you give us a call.

651
01:04:03,998 --> 01:04:05,487
Yes. Absolutely.

652
01:04:06,366 --> 01:04:07,957
Let's go.

653
01:05:04,503 --> 01:05:07,665
This is what Sister Abigail
was talking about. Look.

654
01:05:07,839 --> 01:05:11,535
"Character-disturbed children."
Look at the symptoms.

655
01:05:11,708 --> 01:05:16,803
"Superficially charming. Difficulty
at making and keeping friends."

656
01:05:17,545 --> 01:05:19,307
I'm not sure this is what she meant.

657
01:05:19,480 --> 01:05:23,415
She could've told Dr. Browning
whatever she wanted to hear. Look.

658
01:05:26,017 --> 01:05:28,075
They "are adroit manipulators...

659
01:05:28,285 --> 01:05:32,084
...oftentimes playing people off
one another to get what they want."

660
01:05:32,288 --> 01:05:34,517
Well, you gonna show this
to Dr. Browning?

661
01:05:34,690 --> 01:05:37,021
I'm not showing her anything.

662
01:05:37,558 --> 01:05:39,218
I'm not seeing her anymore.

663
01:05:39,392 --> 01:05:42,360
- When did you decide that?
- When do you think?

664
01:05:42,528 --> 01:05:44,392
You're gonna discount Dr. Browning?

665
01:05:44,562 --> 01:05:48,361
Why does everyone get the benefit
of the doubt from you except for me?

666
01:05:58,305 --> 01:06:01,363
If you need help with the kids,
we can arrange that.

667
01:06:01,540 --> 01:06:03,804
I don't need help.

668
01:06:12,814 --> 01:06:14,611
I just wanna know more about her.

669
01:06:14,816 --> 01:06:18,750
I wanna know where she came from,
and I wanna know who she is.

670
01:06:18,918 --> 01:06:21,113
What if Sister Abigail was right?

671
01:06:21,319 --> 01:06:24,082
I mean, if someone was in danger,
our own children...

672
01:06:24,255 --> 01:06:26,950
...wouldn't you wanna know?
- Of course I would.

673
01:06:27,123 --> 01:06:30,888
I'll contact the orphanage she came from
in Russia. All right?

674
01:06:31,059 --> 01:06:32,583
I mean, it's a start.

675
01:06:42,967 --> 01:06:45,594
- What?
- Hey.

676
01:06:52,040 --> 01:06:53,529
Fine.

677
01:06:53,707 --> 01:06:57,039
I was wondering if you'd heard from
anyone at the Sludyanka Shelter.

678
01:06:57,210 --> 01:06:59,905
Sister Abigail had mentioned
that she would...

679
01:07:00,445 --> 01:07:01,638
Oh, you did.

680
01:07:04,781 --> 01:07:07,977
I don't understand. How can they have
no record of her being there?

681
01:07:09,751 --> 01:07:11,048
Yes, please.

682
01:07:11,219 --> 01:07:15,347
Could you just call me as soon as
you know anything, please? Thank you.

683
01:07:47,309 --> 01:07:48,901
Esther, we gotta go.

684
01:07:55,581 --> 01:07:57,276
Esther?

685
01:08:01,284 --> 01:08:03,013
Esther?

686
01:08:04,453 --> 01:08:05,784
You got me.

687
01:08:08,690 --> 01:08:11,487
- What?
- I don't want to go to the dentist.

688
01:08:11,658 --> 01:08:14,285
- Why not?
- I just don't want to go.

689
01:08:14,460 --> 01:08:16,689
- What, are you scared?
- No.

690
01:08:18,596 --> 01:08:20,461
We're gonna reschedule, though.

691
01:08:20,631 --> 01:08:24,861
Tell you what, I'll let you play hooky
if you want to come and draw with me.

692
01:08:25,033 --> 01:08:26,966
All right.

693
01:08:30,637 --> 01:08:32,331
Wait, Daniel.

694
01:08:32,504 --> 01:08:35,961
How are you two getting along
with Esther?

695
01:08:38,475 --> 01:08:39,635
Fine, I guess.

696
01:08:39,810 --> 01:08:41,140
- Yeah?
- Yeah, Mom.

697
01:08:43,446 --> 01:08:47,471
But has she ever made you feel,
I don't know, uncomfortable...

698
01:08:47,648 --> 01:08:50,639
...or has she done anything
that she's not supposed to do?

699
01:08:51,651 --> 01:08:55,779
- No.
- Like, has she ever hurt any of you?

700
01:08:56,921 --> 01:08:58,512
No.

701
01:09:02,057 --> 01:09:03,456
You sure?

702
01:09:06,927 --> 01:09:10,020
Okay. All right.

703
01:09:11,631 --> 01:09:14,224
I like it when it's just the two of us.

704
01:09:14,432 --> 01:09:18,491
You don't know how long I've waited
for a daddy just like you.

705
01:09:18,668 --> 01:09:20,135
Mommy too, right?

706
01:09:22,137 --> 01:09:24,001
I don't think
Mommy likes me very much.

707
01:09:24,171 --> 01:09:25,570
Hey.

708
01:09:25,740 --> 01:09:28,299
- That is not true. Mommy loves you.
- It's all right.

709
01:09:28,475 --> 01:09:31,568
It must be hard to love an adopted child
as much as your own.

710
01:09:31,744 --> 01:09:36,202
Sweetheart, you're just as much a part
of this family as Danny and Max. Okay?

711
01:09:37,314 --> 01:09:40,543
Do something nice for Mommy.
Show her how much you love her.

712
01:09:40,715 --> 01:09:43,240
That's a wonderful idea.

713
01:10:02,864 --> 01:10:05,024
I have a special surprise
for you, Mommy.

714
01:10:05,999 --> 01:10:07,397
You do?

715
01:10:09,034 --> 01:10:11,764
I picked these flowers just for you.

716
01:10:14,737 --> 01:10:20,696
- Esther, what did you do? God.
- My arm!

717
01:10:20,875 --> 01:10:22,240
- Why did you do this?
- Daddy, my arm!

718
01:10:23,977 --> 01:10:25,103
- John!
- Hey.

719
01:10:25,278 --> 01:10:28,269
- What did you do?
- Hey. Stop, stop.

720
01:10:28,480 --> 01:10:29,537
Why did you do this?

721
01:10:29,714 --> 01:10:32,773
- Oh, God. God, she did this on purpose.
- No, no, no.

722
01:10:32,983 --> 01:10:34,416
- Yes, she did.
- Hey. Honey, no.

723
01:10:34,583 --> 01:10:37,017
She knew what these roses meant to me.

724
01:10:37,186 --> 01:10:40,517
It's my fault, hon. I told her
to do something nice for you.

725
01:10:40,688 --> 01:10:42,383
I can't believe this.

726
01:12:24,555 --> 01:12:26,818
Daddy!

727
01:12:27,557 --> 01:12:29,820
Daddy!

728
01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:33,450
Daddy, Daddy!

729
01:12:33,628 --> 01:12:34,685
What is it, honey?

730
01:12:35,329 --> 01:12:37,489
My arm still hurts.

731
01:12:42,434 --> 01:12:45,868
Can I have a look at it?
You're okay.

732
01:12:46,069 --> 01:12:48,502
I'll be gentle. It's all right, honey.

733
01:12:48,670 --> 01:12:50,433
Oh, my God.

734
01:12:52,306 --> 01:12:54,796
We need to take you to the hospital.

735
01:12:59,378 --> 01:13:01,811
You're a brave little girl,
you know that?

736
01:13:01,980 --> 01:13:04,777
Doctor said you're gonna heal 
real fast, okay?

737
01:13:21,292 --> 01:13:22,486
You broke her arm.

738
01:13:26,595 --> 01:13:28,721
It's impossible.
I didn't grab her that hard.

739
01:13:28,897 --> 01:13:33,992
She wants to sleep in here tonight.
Maybe you should sleep downstairs.

740
01:13:53,913 --> 01:13:56,347
I'm having guests for dinner.

741
01:14:00,484 --> 01:14:03,179
You know, you can have it. Thanks.

742
01:15:06,560 --> 01:15:08,789
Have a good day.

743
01:15:16,700 --> 01:15:18,292
Daniel.

744
01:15:18,468 --> 01:15:20,196
Your books.

745
01:15:23,705 --> 01:15:26,969
- What happened? Let me see your bag.
- I don't know.

746
01:15:29,242 --> 01:15:32,733
We just bought this.
Pick it up, it's gonna get wet.

747
01:15:39,314 --> 01:15:40,975
Mom!

748
01:15:43,184 --> 01:15:46,414
Max! No! Help!

749
01:15:47,920 --> 01:15:49,717
Max!

750
01:15:51,489 --> 01:15:53,047
Max!

751
01:16:05,398 --> 01:16:06,956
Max!

752
01:16:14,471 --> 01:16:16,335
Max!

753
01:16:16,505 --> 01:16:18,268
Are you okay?

754
01:16:18,440 --> 01:16:21,806
I'm here. Mommy's here.
You're okay, honey. Come on.

755
01:16:21,975 --> 01:16:26,934
I got you. Yeah. Oh, baby, it's okay.
I'm so sorry.

756
01:16:28,980 --> 01:16:31,470
I remember I put it in park
and I set the brake.

757
01:16:31,649 --> 01:16:34,344
Max didn't indicate
that Esther did anything.

758
01:16:34,517 --> 01:16:39,612
Well, Max is covering for her.
And I don't think it's the first time.

759
01:16:39,787 --> 01:16:43,313
It also wouldn't be the first time
you blamed Esther for your own mistake.

760
01:16:46,859 --> 01:16:49,326
You know what?
I want her out of this house.

761
01:16:49,494 --> 01:16:51,757
You're ready for somebody
to come and take her?

762
01:16:51,929 --> 01:16:54,362
I am. I don't care.

763
01:16:54,530 --> 01:16:58,363
I will do whatever it takes
to protect my children.

764
01:16:58,533 --> 01:17:00,227
The girls found this this morning.

765
01:17:01,168 --> 01:17:03,863
The girls found it.
You mean Esther found it.

766
01:17:04,037 --> 01:17:06,664
Yes, Esther. Does it make
any difference? Is she lying?

767
01:17:06,838 --> 01:17:07,963
You need help.

768
01:17:08,139 --> 01:17:11,164
We've reserved a place for you
in a rehabilitation facility...

769
01:17:11,341 --> 01:17:13,672
...about 45 minutes from here.

770
01:17:13,842 --> 01:17:15,207
I didn't drink it.

771
01:17:15,377 --> 01:17:18,811
I bought two bottles.
I poured one of them down the sink.

772
01:17:18,979 --> 01:17:20,708
- But not this one?
- No.

773
01:17:20,881 --> 01:17:24,679
John, I haven't had a drink
in almost a year.

774
01:17:24,849 --> 01:17:27,317
We wanna help you,
but there's nothing we can do...

775
01:17:27,484 --> 01:17:31,544
...until you stop lying to yourself.
- I'm not lying. I wanted to drink it.

776
01:17:31,754 --> 01:17:35,314
You have no fucking idea how badly
I wanted to drink it, but I didn't.

777
01:17:35,490 --> 01:17:37,855
- I didn't drink it.
- lf Max had gotten hurt...

778
01:17:38,025 --> 01:17:41,618
What happened this morning
has nothing to do with this.

779
01:17:41,794 --> 01:17:43,386
I find that hard to believe.

780
01:17:44,163 --> 01:17:48,325
The only reason that I'm sober
is because of Max and Daniel.

781
01:17:49,399 --> 01:17:52,958
I think about what would have happened
had you not been there...

782
01:17:53,134 --> 01:17:55,159
...and it makes me wanna kill myself.

783
01:17:55,337 --> 01:17:57,065
I would never do anything...

784
01:17:57,271 --> 01:18:00,330
...to let something like that
ever happen again. I wouldn't.

785
01:18:00,506 --> 01:18:02,803
That is so manipulative.

786
01:18:02,975 --> 01:18:06,341
I know I haven't given you reason
to believe me, I know I haven't.

787
01:18:06,510 --> 01:18:08,841
I lied to you.
I should have told you about this.

788
01:18:09,012 --> 01:18:12,344
I'll go to therapy, I'll go to fucking A.A.
if that's what you want...

789
01:18:12,514 --> 01:18:14,879
...but you have to believe me.
- I don't.

790
01:18:15,049 --> 01:18:17,881
You have to believe me.
John, you have to trust me on this.

791
01:18:18,051 --> 01:18:20,484
I'll give you a week to go to rehab...

792
01:18:20,653 --> 01:18:23,177
...or I'm leaving
and I'm taking the kids with me.

793
01:18:23,355 --> 01:18:25,549
I think that's fair, okay?

794
01:18:25,723 --> 01:18:28,247
I'll help you as much as I can,
make it really easy.

795
01:18:28,424 --> 01:18:30,220
Mom's gonna come in the afternoon.

796
01:18:30,392 --> 01:18:35,351
All right? I'm willing to do this.
I'm willing to try and figure this out.

797
01:18:35,529 --> 01:18:39,327
- But it's up to you.
- I'll shoot Mommy if you tell.

798
01:19:00,245 --> 01:19:02,940
Max. Max, are you okay?

799
01:19:04,114 --> 01:19:07,605
What did she do? Did she do something
to make the car crash?

800
01:19:09,318 --> 01:19:13,719
If you saw her, you have to help me,
so Mom and Dad can protect us.

801
01:19:16,722 --> 01:19:17,916
Why not?

802
01:19:27,095 --> 01:19:29,188
Is that Sister Abigail?

803
01:19:36,335 --> 01:19:39,235
Max. What did she do
in my tree house?

804
01:19:42,072 --> 01:19:43,767
Are the bad things still there?

805
01:19:47,108 --> 01:19:49,076
Everything's gonna be okay.

806
01:19:49,244 --> 01:19:53,975
I'll get the stuff from the tree house.
Then they'll have to believe us.

807
01:20:41,110 --> 01:20:44,340
- Going somewhere, Kate?
- What are you doing here?

808
01:20:44,512 --> 01:20:47,002
She's fine. Let's not wake her.

809
01:20:47,181 --> 01:20:48,341
Go to your room.

810
01:20:48,515 --> 01:20:52,075
Honestly, we're past that now.
Aren't we?

811
01:20:52,251 --> 01:20:54,309
I know what you're doing.

812
01:20:55,486 --> 01:20:57,351
I will not let you hurt my children.

813
01:20:57,521 --> 01:20:58,748
Me?

814
01:20:58,922 --> 01:21:02,516
I'm not the one who passed out drunk
and let Max almost drown in the pond.

815
01:21:02,691 --> 01:21:04,123
If it wasn't for John...

816
01:21:04,292 --> 01:21:08,091
...she'd be dead,
and you'd probably still be in jail.

817
01:21:10,029 --> 01:21:11,121
Who told you that?

818
01:21:13,832 --> 01:21:15,026
It's very intimate.

819
01:21:15,966 --> 01:21:17,627
- I learned so much.
- Give it to me.

820
01:21:17,801 --> 01:21:21,326
- Jessica. Your cheating husband.
- Esther, give it to me.

821
01:21:21,503 --> 01:21:23,300
Where you hide your wine bottles.

822
01:21:23,472 --> 01:21:25,803
I'm... I'm warning you right now.

823
01:21:25,973 --> 01:21:28,304
"She was still kicking
when the doctor told me...

824
01:21:28,475 --> 01:21:31,170
...it was something called phantom...

825
01:21:31,343 --> 01:21:32,809
...fetal movement.

826
01:21:32,977 --> 01:21:36,639
- For 16 days, I carried my dead baby."
- Stop it. Esther.

827
01:21:36,813 --> 01:21:40,043
"It was the cruelest torture
I could imagine."

828
01:21:40,216 --> 01:21:42,649
Stop it. You stop it.

829
01:21:42,817 --> 01:21:44,943
What's wrong with you?

830
01:21:45,119 --> 01:21:47,882
Kate, it's too late. It's your own fault.

831
01:21:48,054 --> 01:21:49,714
You took your family for granted.

832
01:21:50,322 --> 01:21:53,449
- What do you mean?
- What are you going to do?

833
01:21:55,125 --> 01:21:56,820
Hit me?

834
01:22:02,563 --> 01:22:05,622
We adopted her from you.
How could you not know anything?

835
01:22:05,799 --> 01:22:08,062
The Sullivans could have 
adopted her illegally.

836
01:22:08,234 --> 01:22:11,202
She doesn't remember anything
that could help us?

837
01:22:13,070 --> 01:22:14,560
I'm gonna call you back.

838
01:23:31,987 --> 01:23:34,853
"Saarne Institute."

839
01:23:53,936 --> 01:23:57,734
Hello. Do you speak English?

840
01:23:59,606 --> 01:24:01,266
Do you speak English?

841
01:24:01,440 --> 01:24:03,430
Is there anyone
who speaks English there?

842
01:24:03,608 --> 01:24:05,576
This is very important.

843
01:24:09,645 --> 01:24:11,010
I don't know what you're saying.

844
01:24:24,321 --> 01:24:26,652
- Hello?
- Is this the Saarne Institute?

845
01:24:26,822 --> 01:24:28,380
Yes.

846
01:24:28,557 --> 01:24:31,991
Yes. I need to talk to somebody
about one of your children.

847
01:24:32,159 --> 01:24:34,786
She was adopted by an American family.
It's a girl.

848
01:24:34,961 --> 01:24:38,088
She is not come from here.

849
01:24:38,263 --> 01:24:40,389
Well, I haven't even
told you her name yet.

850
01:24:40,564 --> 01:24:43,430
You do not understand.
Saarne Institute is not an orphanage.

851
01:24:43,600 --> 01:24:44,965
It is a mental hospital.

852
01:25:12,986 --> 01:25:14,953
Are you looking for this?

853
01:25:17,154 --> 01:25:18,553
Poor Sister Abigail.

854
01:25:19,757 --> 01:25:24,522
I couldn't have done it myself,
you know. Max is just as guilty as I am.

855
01:25:24,693 --> 01:25:28,355
- Whatever Max did, you made her do it.
- Think about it.

856
01:25:28,562 --> 01:25:31,053
How did she even know
what was up here?

857
01:25:31,664 --> 01:25:34,826
It's always better
to burn the evidence.

858
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:39,867
If they find these things,
they won't just be coming for me.

859
01:25:40,069 --> 01:25:41,798
They'll be coming for Max too.

860
01:25:43,272 --> 01:25:45,172
- Is that really what you want?
- Wait.

861
01:25:46,974 --> 01:25:48,305
What are you doing?

862
01:25:49,509 --> 01:25:51,101
Are you crazy?

863
01:25:57,781 --> 01:25:59,112
Let me out!

864
01:25:59,283 --> 01:26:01,113
Let me out of here!

865
01:26:11,456 --> 01:26:14,447
Mom!

866
01:26:14,959 --> 01:26:19,985
It's called the Saarne Institute.
S-A-A-R-N-E, Saarne.

867
01:26:20,162 --> 01:26:21,390
It's in Estonia.

868
01:26:21,597 --> 01:26:26,157
Estonia? No, this can't be right.
All of her paperwork is from Russia.

869
01:26:26,333 --> 01:26:28,732
I'm sending them a picture
of her right now.

870
01:26:28,901 --> 01:26:31,664
Maybe her birth mother
was a patient there.

871
01:26:31,836 --> 01:26:34,395
I don't know.
Maybe she was even born there.

872
01:26:39,741 --> 01:26:41,800
Mom!

873
01:26:42,610 --> 01:26:45,476
Help!

874
01:27:01,623 --> 01:27:03,852
Mom! Dad!

875
01:27:11,228 --> 01:27:12,718
Oh, God!

876
01:27:22,003 --> 01:27:24,163
Oh, God. Call 911!

877
01:27:36,045 --> 01:27:38,569
Don't worry. You're going to heaven.

878
01:27:41,282 --> 01:27:43,044
Oh, God!

879
01:27:45,384 --> 01:27:49,843
Oh, my God! Daniel!

880
01:27:50,455 --> 01:27:52,888
Move away! Move away from the fire!

881
01:27:53,056 --> 01:27:54,113
Daniel?

882
01:27:54,290 --> 01:27:58,589
Oh, God, no. Daniel?
Mommy's right here. Can you hear me?

883
01:27:58,760 --> 01:28:01,751
Please wake up.
Honey, Mommy's right here, okay?

884
01:28:01,929 --> 01:28:04,158
You're gonna be all right.

885
01:28:14,536 --> 01:28:18,801
We stopped the abdominal bleeding,
but he has a very serious neck injury.

886
01:28:18,973 --> 01:28:23,032
He's stabilized for now. You should
consider yourselves very lucky.

887
01:28:23,209 --> 01:28:25,574
- Can we see him?
- In a little while.

888
01:28:25,744 --> 01:28:27,712
He's resting in the ICU.

889
01:28:27,878 --> 01:28:31,313
Okay. And will he be able to tell us
what happened?

890
01:28:31,481 --> 01:28:33,039
It's possible.

891
01:28:33,216 --> 01:28:36,308
No way of knowing for sure
what he'll remember until he wakes up.

892
01:28:37,084 --> 01:28:38,676
Excuse me.

893
01:28:41,454 --> 01:28:43,284
It's gonna be okay.

894
01:28:47,058 --> 01:28:51,152
I know you're exhausted
and upset, and so am I.

895
01:28:51,327 --> 01:28:55,126
There has to be some other explanation.
She didn't come from an insane asylum.

896
01:28:55,296 --> 01:28:59,628
The orphanage you thought
she came from has never heard of her.

897
01:28:59,799 --> 01:29:01,562
Everything about her could be a lie.

898
01:29:01,734 --> 01:29:04,725
We have her passport. We have
school records, medical records.

899
01:29:04,902 --> 01:29:06,995
These are papers
from around the world.

900
01:29:07,204 --> 01:29:09,228
What is this? It's a piece of paper.

901
01:29:09,406 --> 01:29:13,636
Your own mother was there this time. It
wasn't just me. Your mother was there.

902
01:29:14,275 --> 01:29:17,175
It's either Esther
or Daniel who started the fire.

903
01:29:17,344 --> 01:29:20,107
- Who do you think it was?
- I don't know.

904
01:29:20,279 --> 01:29:22,940
I'm so done.
I'm done connecting these dots for you.

905
01:29:23,114 --> 01:29:25,581
You know, you can think
whatever you want about me.

906
01:29:25,749 --> 01:29:29,081
I will leave tonight. If that's
what you want, I will leave tonight.

907
01:29:29,252 --> 01:29:31,481
On one condition. Esther goes too.

908
01:29:35,456 --> 01:29:37,650
Can I have a dollar
for the soda machine?

909
01:29:38,158 --> 01:29:41,024
Your mother wants you
to stay right there.

910
01:29:47,431 --> 01:29:50,796
There you go. Don't be too long.

911
01:30:24,254 --> 01:30:25,743
Okay.

912
01:31:16,020 --> 01:31:17,487
What? What is it, sweetie?

913
01:31:27,495 --> 01:31:29,656
Code 99, ICU.

914
01:31:29,830 --> 01:31:32,229
Code 99, ICU.

915
01:31:32,732 --> 01:31:35,029
- Coming through, coming through.
- Mom, take Max.

916
01:31:35,200 --> 01:31:38,531
Let's go, Room 304! Crash
cart coming through! Move, people!

917
01:31:39,035 --> 01:31:41,060
- Daniel?
- Clear the hall! Clear the hall!

918
01:31:41,238 --> 01:31:44,433
You have to stay out here.
He's in cardiac arrest. Stay out here.

919
01:31:44,606 --> 01:31:45,664
Daniel!

920
01:31:47,941 --> 01:31:49,169
- Here we go.
- Start a drip.

921
01:31:49,343 --> 01:31:51,276
- Check BP, please.
- Check ventilation.

922
01:31:51,444 --> 01:31:52,876
Oh, God.

923
01:31:53,044 --> 01:31:55,671
We got a pulse. We got a pulse.

924
01:31:58,548 --> 01:31:59,572
Kate.

925
01:32:00,617 --> 01:32:02,243
Kate.

926
01:32:03,685 --> 01:32:07,050
What did you do?
What did you do to him, you bitch?

927
01:32:07,220 --> 01:32:08,278
Stop, stop!

928
01:32:08,455 --> 01:32:11,355
- Orderlies!
- She's trying to kill my baby!

929
01:32:11,524 --> 01:32:12,956
- Daddy!
- Hold her!

930
01:32:13,124 --> 01:32:15,217
She's trying to kill my baby!

931
01:32:16,426 --> 01:32:17,723
Hold her still.

932
01:32:18,394 --> 01:32:20,055
Get off me.

933
01:32:21,363 --> 01:32:23,456
Hold her still. Hold her still.

934
01:32:24,064 --> 01:32:26,555
Okay. Easy, easy.

935
01:32:26,734 --> 01:32:28,963
- You okay?
- There you go.

936
01:32:48,948 --> 01:32:52,041
- Kate.
- Daniel.

937
01:32:52,217 --> 01:32:54,707
They're running tests.
We should know more tomorrow.

938
01:32:54,885 --> 01:32:57,079
Don't worry about Daniel.
He'll be okay.

939
01:32:58,353 --> 01:32:59,911
He'll be home in a few days.

940
01:33:00,088 --> 01:33:01,952
You need to stay here, get some rest.

941
01:33:02,123 --> 01:33:04,113
I'm gonna take Max and Esther home.

942
01:33:04,291 --> 01:33:06,225
Johnny.

943
01:33:07,793 --> 01:33:10,420
Please don't let her near Max.

944
01:33:13,463 --> 01:33:14,953
I love you.

945
01:35:47,830 --> 01:35:49,763
Hello, Daddy.

946
01:35:51,866 --> 01:35:54,391
- What are you wearing?
- Do you like it?

947
01:35:56,369 --> 01:35:59,030
Oh, Jesus.

948
01:36:04,675 --> 01:36:08,667
Look at you. What have you done
to your face? What is this?

949
01:36:11,513 --> 01:36:14,276
I don't want to be alone. I'm scared.

950
01:36:21,552 --> 01:36:23,951
I love you, Daddy.

951
01:36:24,120 --> 01:36:26,178
You too, hon.

952
01:36:26,355 --> 01:36:27,788
I really love you.

953
01:36:30,391 --> 01:36:32,085
I know.

954
01:36:32,626 --> 01:36:33,684
I know.

955
01:36:36,796 --> 01:36:39,263
John, let me take care of you.

956
01:36:39,764 --> 01:36:41,856
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

957
01:36:44,200 --> 01:36:48,999
What's gotten into you, huh?
What's going on?

958
01:36:53,406 --> 01:36:55,999
You said you loved me.

959
01:37:01,645 --> 01:37:04,875
You are so confused.

960
01:37:05,748 --> 01:37:08,648
You know what?
I don't love you like that.

961
01:37:08,816 --> 01:37:12,114
That's the way Kate and I
love each other.

962
01:37:14,720 --> 01:37:16,278
You understand?

963
01:37:17,321 --> 01:37:19,084
I don't see that.

964
01:37:20,623 --> 01:37:23,113
- You have to respect your mother.
- I do.

965
01:37:23,292 --> 01:37:26,783
I just feel like I'm alone sometimes
in respecting you.

966
01:37:26,961 --> 01:37:31,158
I don't think anyone ever thinks
about what you might be feeling.

967
01:37:31,331 --> 01:37:34,128
I really care about you, John.

968
01:37:34,300 --> 01:37:36,927
Yeah, I know, Esther.

969
01:37:39,970 --> 01:37:42,597
I'm just... I'm tired.

970
01:37:43,672 --> 01:37:46,435
I'm very tired.

971
01:37:46,607 --> 01:37:48,665
And I don't know what to do.
It's difficult.

972
01:37:48,842 --> 01:37:51,469
I mean,
everything is just falling apart...

973
01:37:51,643 --> 01:37:56,306
...and, oh, my God,
I'm so worried for Daniel.

974
01:37:59,783 --> 01:38:01,807
Oh, God.

975
01:38:02,318 --> 01:38:04,808
You're a good person, John.

976
01:38:04,986 --> 01:38:07,283
You're a great father.

977
01:38:08,755 --> 01:38:10,814
And a handsome man.

978
01:38:14,191 --> 01:38:16,091
Jesus Christ!

979
01:38:16,260 --> 01:38:17,988
My God, stop, stop, stop!

980
01:38:18,161 --> 01:38:20,822
Just stop talking and go upstairs!
Go to your room!

981
01:38:20,996 --> 01:38:24,590
- Stop talking to me like I'm a child.
- I'm calling Sister Judith tomorrow.

982
01:38:24,766 --> 01:38:27,666
We're gonna have a conversation
about your future in this house.

983
01:38:27,834 --> 01:38:29,596
I just... I can't do it anymore.

984
01:38:31,503 --> 01:38:32,765
Fine.

985
01:38:36,173 --> 01:38:37,161
Esther.

986
01:38:36,173 --> 01:38:37,161
Esther.

987
01:38:59,155 --> 01:39:01,213
- Hello?
- Yeah. This is she.

988
01:39:01,389 --> 01:39:04,846
My name is Dr. Vrava.
I'm calling from the Saarne Institute.

989
01:39:06,826 --> 01:39:10,192
- I've just seen the picture you e-mailed.
- And do you recognize her?

990
01:39:10,362 --> 01:39:14,057
Where is she right now? Is she
someplace where she can hear you?

991
01:39:14,230 --> 01:39:16,993
No, she's not with me.
She's with my husband at home.

992
01:39:17,166 --> 01:39:21,898
Call your husband right now, and tell him
to get your family out of the house.

993
01:39:22,103 --> 01:39:26,162
- And then call the police.
- He won't listen to me. But why?

994
01:39:26,338 --> 01:39:30,137
Then tell him the little girl in the picture
is not really a little girl.

995
01:39:30,308 --> 01:39:33,208
- She's a grown woman.
- What?

996
01:39:33,377 --> 01:39:35,867
What are you talking about?
The picture I sent you...

997
01:39:36,045 --> 01:39:39,843
... is of our adopted daughter,
and she's 9 years old.

998
01:39:40,014 --> 01:39:41,982
No, she's not.

999
01:39:42,415 --> 01:39:47,078
She has a rare hormone disorder.
It's called hypopituitarism.

1000
01:39:47,252 --> 01:39:50,220
It causes proportional dwarfism.
She only looks like a child.

1001
01:39:50,755 --> 01:39:56,020
According to our records,
Leena Klammer was born in 1976.

1002
01:39:56,192 --> 01:39:58,159
She's 33 years old.

1003
01:39:58,326 --> 01:40:00,725
This can't be. This is a mistake.

1004
01:40:00,894 --> 01:40:04,090
I hope so, for your sake.
Does she have the scars?

1005
01:40:04,263 --> 01:40:06,924
What? I don't know. What scars?

1006
01:40:07,132 --> 01:40:09,531
Leena was one
of our most violent patients.

1007
01:40:09,700 --> 01:40:12,190
When she was here,
she was kept in a straitjacket...

1008
01:40:12,368 --> 01:40:14,198
... to stop her from hurting our staff.

1009
01:40:14,369 --> 01:40:16,360
She was constantly fighting
to get out.

1010
01:40:16,538 --> 01:40:21,564
It cut into her skin and left her
with scars around her wrists and neck.

1011
01:40:21,741 --> 01:40:24,038
There is no way
you could not have seen them.

1012
01:40:24,210 --> 01:40:25,676
Why was she at your hospital?

1013
01:40:25,844 --> 01:40:30,280
She's dangerously ill, violent.
She killed seven people that we know of.

1014
01:40:30,447 --> 01:40:33,244
Oh, my God. How could she fool us?

1015
01:40:33,416 --> 01:40:37,077
She has been passing herself off
as a little girl for most of her life.

1016
01:40:37,751 --> 01:40:40,776
She tricked a family here in Estonia
into adopting her.

1017
01:40:40,954 --> 01:40:45,946
When she couldn't seduce the father,
she killed him and his whole family.

1018
01:40:46,157 --> 01:40:49,683
- Then she burned the house down.
- Yes. How did you know?

1019
01:40:49,860 --> 01:40:52,919
She disappeared a year ago
and we lost track of her.

1020
01:40:53,095 --> 01:40:56,154
If it's really Leena,
you don't have much time.

1021
01:41:37,257 --> 01:41:38,986
Esther?

1022
01:42:52,806 --> 01:42:55,865
Come on, Johnny. Come on.
Pick up the fucking phone.

1023
01:43:06,381 --> 01:43:08,177
Shit.

1024
01:43:30,064 --> 01:43:31,792
Come on.

1025
01:43:31,965 --> 01:43:33,056
[ TRUCK HORN HONKING ]

1026
01:43:33,265 --> 01:43:34,459
Oh, God!

1027
01:44:06,887 --> 01:44:08,319
Come on.

1028
01:44:11,857 --> 01:44:12,880
Come on.

1029
01:44:13,057 --> 01:44:14,752
911. What is your emergency?

1030
01:44:14,926 --> 01:44:17,894
I need the police.
We have an intruder in our home.

1031
01:44:51,349 --> 01:44:52,407
Come on.

1032
01:44:56,886 --> 01:44:58,251
- This is John.
- John?

1033
01:44:58,420 --> 01:45:00,285
You've reached my cell,
but I can't pick up.

1034
01:45:00,455 --> 01:45:01,819
Oh, fuck it.

1035
01:46:18,372 --> 01:46:20,067
John?

1036
01:46:25,243 --> 01:46:28,302
John? John?

1037
01:46:30,413 --> 01:46:33,006
No, God!

1038
01:46:45,156 --> 01:46:46,986
No, God!

1039
01:46:50,026 --> 01:46:51,391
Max.

1040
01:48:31,259 --> 01:48:33,089
What the fuck?

1041
01:51:03,924 --> 01:51:06,653
Esther! Don't you hurt her!

1042
01:51:12,263 --> 01:51:15,197
Leave her alone! I'm here!

1043
01:51:16,199 --> 01:51:17,790
Esther!

1044
01:52:48,325 --> 01:52:49,622
I know.

1045
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:47,991
Go back. It's too dangerous. Go back.

1046
01:55:01,645 --> 01:55:03,578
Please.

1047
01:55:03,746 --> 01:55:05,838
Don't let me die, Mommy.

1048
01:55:09,350 --> 01:55:12,910
I'm not your fucking Mommy!

1049
01:55:28,929 --> 01:55:31,158
Baby, it's okay.

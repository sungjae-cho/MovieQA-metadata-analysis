1
00:00:46,826 --> 00:00:48,135
Chapter one.

2
00:00:48,202 --> 00:00:51,618
Sometimes, despite your
best efforts otherwise,

3
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:53,698
life will give you lemons.

4
00:00:59,659 --> 00:01:02,790
When that happens,
you've got two choices,
friend.

5
00:01:03,371 --> 00:01:07,943
You can wear a sour face
or make lemonade.

6
00:02:55,952 --> 00:02:58,287
I never should have
booked this city.

7
00:02:58,352 --> 00:03:00,773
Come on,
come on, come on.

8
00:03:01,424 --> 00:03:02,668
Finally!

9
00:03:03,024 --> 00:03:04,039
Huh?

10
00:03:04,112 --> 00:03:06,087
What, did you swim here?
Might as well have.

11
00:03:06,161 --> 00:03:07,143
This is exactly
why I tell you

12
00:03:07,217 --> 00:03:08,297
you gotta fly in
the night before.

13
00:03:08,368 --> 00:03:09,546
The less time I spend
in this city, the better.

14
00:03:09,616 --> 00:03:11,504
I know, I know, I know.
But you'll be enthused
to know

15
00:03:11,569 --> 00:03:12,813
that I reamed
customer service.

16
00:03:12,881 --> 00:03:14,572
Your bag is gonna be
on the very next flight.

17
00:03:14,641 --> 00:03:15,786
But have no fear.

18
00:03:15,857 --> 00:03:19,152
There is a brand-new suit
waiting for you right here.

19
00:03:19,217 --> 00:03:20,329
Where'd you conjure
this up from?

20
00:03:20,401 --> 00:03:21,994
Well, rainmakers
make rain...

21
00:03:22,065 --> 00:03:23,374
Room key.
Voilà.

22
00:03:23,441 --> 00:03:25,580
There's a gorgeous
latte-colored
silk tie in there.

23
00:03:25,649 --> 00:03:27,624
I think you're gonna
love it. It's subtle...
Latte?

24
00:03:27,697 --> 00:03:29,486
Okay, there's a red
one in there, too. Okay?

25
00:03:29,554 --> 00:03:31,823
Can you please
just look your best?
Please, okay?

26
00:03:31,889 --> 00:03:36,046
Listen, all three
Unicom suits will fly
in from New York

27
00:03:36,114 --> 00:03:38,602
day after tomorrow
to see if we can
make a deal.

28
00:03:38,674 --> 00:03:40,200
All three of them?

29
00:03:40,274 --> 00:03:42,958
I'm Lane goddamned Marshall.

30
00:03:46,642 --> 00:03:49,195
Burke, for once
in your life, can you
please take the elevator?

31
00:03:49,267 --> 00:03:50,511
See you.

32
00:03:53,107 --> 00:03:55,179
Coming to the seminar?
Okay.

33
00:03:55,987 --> 00:03:57,874
Okay. Big day. Big day.

34
00:04:38,964 --> 00:04:40,459
And don't forget
the DVDs and audio books

35
00:04:40,533 --> 00:04:43,183
available for purchase
all through the week

36
00:04:43,252 --> 00:04:45,522
at our booth down the hall.

37
00:04:45,589 --> 00:04:48,655
And now,
without further ado,

38
00:04:48,725 --> 00:04:53,330
the author of the bestseller
A Path Through Grief,
my friend...

39
00:04:53,397 --> 00:04:56,561
No, my inspiration,
Burke Ryan.

40
00:05:18,454 --> 00:05:19,828
All right!

41
00:05:22,326 --> 00:05:24,269
Thanks, Lane. Wow!

42
00:05:25,174 --> 00:05:26,123
Whoo!

43
00:05:27,287 --> 00:05:29,523
You guys make
a guy feel good.

44
00:05:30,134 --> 00:05:32,207
I'm feeling okay.
How are you?

45
00:05:32,279 --> 00:05:33,872
A-Okay!

46
00:05:33,943 --> 00:05:37,140
Good.
Let me ask you a question.

47
00:05:37,207 --> 00:05:38,734
Any football fans
in the house?

48
00:05:40,375 --> 00:05:44,336
Certain college team
not too long ago
lost their season opener.

49
00:05:45,143 --> 00:05:47,445
They're going nowhere fast.

50
00:05:47,511 --> 00:05:50,992
Then something happened.
Thank you.

51
00:05:51,063 --> 00:05:54,893
An event that
changed everything
for their coach.

52
00:05:54,968 --> 00:05:57,008
The guy started
sleeping at the office,

53
00:05:57,144 --> 00:05:59,217
reinvented the playbook,
studied film.

54
00:05:59,288 --> 00:06:02,037
He was on the case 24-7.

55
00:06:02,168 --> 00:06:05,135
They went on to win
the national championship.

56
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:10,899
Well, after all
the fanfare and the champagne,
he traipsed on home,

57
00:06:11,832 --> 00:06:16,143
went upstairs,
went to his closet

58
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:20,306
and removed his Browning
double-barreled shotgun,

59
00:06:21,945 --> 00:06:25,393
put it to his chin
and pulled the trigger.

60
00:06:27,801 --> 00:06:30,485
See, the event
that changed it all

61
00:06:30,554 --> 00:06:32,626
back at the beginning
of the season?

62
00:06:32,826 --> 00:06:36,982
His brother,
his best friend in the world,
died of a heart attack.

63
00:06:39,066 --> 00:06:42,611
You might be able
to get back on the horse,
do great things.

64
00:06:42,682 --> 00:06:45,912
Hell, you might even win
a national championship.

65
00:06:45,978 --> 00:06:49,622
But if you don't
pay the piper,
he will come calling.

66
00:06:51,866 --> 00:06:55,828
I want to thank each
and every one of you

67
00:06:55,898 --> 00:07:00,209
for having the courage
to really feel
the loss of loved ones.

68
00:07:01,467 --> 00:07:03,289
I know it's not easy.

69
00:07:04,571 --> 00:07:06,229
I've been there.

70
00:07:07,419 --> 00:07:09,524
How are you?
You okay?

71
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:10,806
A-Okay!

72
00:07:10,876 --> 00:07:13,112
Good. All right.
Say it one more time.
How are you?

73
00:07:13,179 --> 00:07:14,903
A-Okay!

74
00:07:14,971 --> 00:07:17,459
All right.
I'll see you in workshop.

75
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:28,278
Perfect. Perfect.

76
00:07:29,308 --> 00:07:31,992
Good. Good. Great.

77
00:07:32,796 --> 00:07:34,706
Come on,
loosen up a little bit.
You need a drink?

78
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:35,925
Maybe you need a drink.
Waiter!

79
00:07:35,996 --> 00:07:38,811
Please, no drink.
Chapter 12.

80
00:07:38,876 --> 00:07:41,942
"Alcohol's no more
a cure-all than a Band-Aid
on a bullet wound."

81
00:07:42,012 --> 00:07:44,914
All right. Now flash me
that sign of yours.

82
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:50,043
Great. Give me that.

83
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:55,443
Great. So, tell me,
what motivated the book?

84
00:07:56,445 --> 00:07:58,649
Uh, my wife died.

85
00:08:00,733 --> 00:08:01,944
I know.

86
00:08:02,749 --> 00:08:04,276
Why tell the whole world
about it?

87
00:08:09,022 --> 00:08:11,029
It was a way to coach myself
how to get through it.

88
00:08:11,102 --> 00:08:13,077
You know, I never
intended for anyone
to actually read it,

89
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:17,143
but my manager
gave it to a publisher
and here I am.

90
00:08:17,214 --> 00:08:19,767
Yes, you are.
What happened?

91
00:08:20,318 --> 00:08:21,627
Uh...

92
00:08:25,918 --> 00:08:28,089
She was driving us
to dinner.

93
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:30,843
Dog in the middle
of the road.

94
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:33,466
Car swerved into a pole.

95
00:08:36,511 --> 00:08:38,235
She died instantly.

96
00:08:44,991 --> 00:08:47,031
It must have been awful.
I'm sorry.

97
00:08:47,999 --> 00:08:49,941
Appreciate it.

98
00:08:51,776 --> 00:08:53,816
Well, I think
I got what I needed.

99
00:08:53,888 --> 00:08:56,092
Great! Fantastic.
Nice to meet you,
Jessica.

100
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,818
Nice to meet you.

101
00:08:58,368 --> 00:08:59,415
You take care.

102
00:08:59,488 --> 00:09:00,436
Thanks.

103
00:09:02,112 --> 00:09:04,283
This way, guys.
Follow Burke.

104
00:09:04,352 --> 00:09:06,141
All right, everybody.

105
00:09:06,208 --> 00:09:07,834
Those of you
who signed up for the
morning work group,

106
00:09:07,904 --> 00:09:09,278
you're in for a treat.

107
00:09:09,344 --> 00:09:10,326
Let's go! Let's go!

108
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,310
Come out in the middle here.
Excuse us.

109
00:09:13,056 --> 00:09:15,576
Thank you.
Excuse us for a second.

110
00:09:15,648 --> 00:09:17,787
Sorry. Come on out here.

111
00:09:18,945 --> 00:09:20,832
Come on, everybody out.

112
00:09:21,473 --> 00:09:24,124
I want you to take
a moment and look around

113
00:09:24,193 --> 00:09:26,779
and tell me what you see
and what you hear.

114
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:28,792
Okay? All right.

115
00:09:29,313 --> 00:09:30,393
Okay.

116
00:09:30,465 --> 00:09:31,447
Lorraine.

117
00:09:31,521 --> 00:09:33,212
Cars. Honking cars.

118
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:34,743
Good. Natalie?

119
00:09:35,201 --> 00:09:36,249
Jackhammers.

120
00:09:36,321 --> 00:09:37,565
-Anybody else?
-Stoplights.

121
00:09:37,633 --> 00:09:38,811
Stoplights.
Cement.

122
00:09:38,881 --> 00:09:39,896
A homeless person.

123
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:40,918
Trash.

124
00:09:40,994 --> 00:09:41,976
Middle fingers.

125
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:43,163
Good. Excellent.

126
00:09:43,234 --> 00:09:46,463
Now remember that
and follow me.

127
00:09:47,586 --> 00:09:50,336
All right. Now what
do you see? Lorraine?

128
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:52,705
The ocean.

129
00:09:53,602 --> 00:09:55,096
-Good.
-Trees.

130
00:09:55,906 --> 00:09:56,854
The Space Needle.

131
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:58,108
Skyscrapers.

132
00:09:58,498 --> 00:09:59,993
Mount Rainier.

133
00:10:00,066 --> 00:10:01,495
Rivers.

134
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:02,977
Beautiful rivers.

135
00:10:03,042 --> 00:10:04,417
The sun.
Good.

136
00:10:04,483 --> 00:10:05,825
Naked hot-tubber.

137
00:10:09,763 --> 00:10:12,927
Wow. Little bit different
up here, isn't it?

138
00:10:12,995 --> 00:10:15,548
And yet, it's the same.

139
00:10:16,675 --> 00:10:18,682
We haven't gone anywhere.

140
00:10:19,652 --> 00:10:22,881
We're just
looking at things from
a new perspective.

141
00:10:24,259 --> 00:10:29,759
Inside of each of you,
there are sirens,
honking horns and gridlock,

142
00:10:32,164 --> 00:10:36,059
but there's also this.

143
00:10:37,572 --> 00:10:39,678
We just have to do the work

144
00:10:40,709 --> 00:10:43,043
and climb the stairs
to find it.

145
00:10:44,324 --> 00:10:46,845
You have the reporter
at noon and I think
you're gonna like her a lot.

146
00:10:46,917 --> 00:10:48,324
Look, I don't
really give a rat's ass

147
00:10:48,389 --> 00:10:49,731
what your
cancellation policy is.

148
00:10:49,797 --> 00:10:51,226
I am leaving and
I want my money back.

149
00:10:51,301 --> 00:10:52,762
Sir, it's not that simple.
I'll be right back.

150
00:10:52,837 --> 00:10:54,364
Our cancellation
policy clearly...

151
00:10:54,437 --> 00:10:56,128
Hi. Becky?
What seems to be
the trouble here?

152
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:59,044
Mr. Ryan, this gentleman
is refusing to adhere...

153
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:01,149
Thank you.
Hi. I'm Burke.

154
00:11:01,894 --> 00:11:02,908
You are?

155
00:11:02,981 --> 00:11:04,061
Walter Mayfield.

156
00:11:04,133 --> 00:11:05,082
Walter. Where you from?

157
00:11:05,157 --> 00:11:06,881
Billings. Drove out
from Billings.

158
00:11:06,949 --> 00:11:08,542
Montana.
That's quite a drive.

159
00:11:08,614 --> 00:11:11,963
Yeah. Look, I don't think
this thing is for me, okay?

160
00:11:12,038 --> 00:11:13,893
Okay. You mind
if I ask why?

161
00:11:13,958 --> 00:11:17,984
Well, frankly,
my sister talked me
into it, and the...

162
00:11:18,054 --> 00:11:20,510
You know the whole...
And the feelings...

163
00:11:20,582 --> 00:11:22,339
I understand.
I understand.

164
00:11:22,407 --> 00:11:24,479
Can I ask you,
why did your sister think

165
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:26,917
it was so important
for you to come here?

166
00:11:29,671 --> 00:11:30,816
My son.

167
00:11:30,887 --> 00:11:32,742
And what's his name?
Stephen.

168
00:11:32,807 --> 00:11:34,782
And when did he...
Does it really matter?

169
00:11:34,855 --> 00:11:37,473
It matters to me, Walter.
I'd like to hear.

170
00:11:42,631 --> 00:11:44,518
Do you have a picture?

171
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,462
I'm sorry.

172
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,131
Walter, I know
how you feel.
I've been there.

173
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:12,033
My wife died.
Three years ago.

174
00:12:13,993 --> 00:12:15,422
I want you to know
that you've taken
the first step

175
00:12:15,497 --> 00:12:18,312
just by walking
through these doors,
and something inside you,

176
00:12:18,377 --> 00:12:21,857
whether you know it or not,
made you drive all this way.

177
00:12:23,849 --> 00:12:26,883
If you want to leave,
we'll honor your request.

178
00:12:27,849 --> 00:12:29,540
I hope you don't.

179
00:12:32,905 --> 00:12:35,491
Thanks, Becky.
Think about it.

180
00:12:42,953 --> 00:12:45,823
Chapter two.
Happiness is a state of mind

181
00:12:46,986 --> 00:12:49,507
and, like all things,
it takes practice.

182
00:12:49,578 --> 00:12:53,637
Devote five minutes a day
to smiling, just smiling,

183
00:12:55,594 --> 00:12:58,409
and after a while
it'll come naturally.

184
00:13:18,987 --> 00:13:21,321
Sorry. I didn't mean to...

185
00:13:35,948 --> 00:13:37,956
Hey, you forgot your pen!

186
00:13:51,565 --> 00:13:53,321
Quidnunc? Quidnunc?

187
00:14:06,349 --> 00:14:07,364
What can I get you?

188
00:14:07,437 --> 00:14:11,747
I would like another
Seven-and-Seven,
and a tomato juice

189
00:14:11,822 --> 00:14:12,770
for my virtuous friend here.

190
00:14:12,845 --> 00:14:13,925
Tomato juice.

191
00:14:13,998 --> 00:14:15,559
Thank you.

192
00:14:15,629 --> 00:14:18,412
So, as far as
Unicom knows,

193
00:14:18,478 --> 00:14:21,740
I'm a hair away
from signing a deal
with Time Warner. Okay?

194
00:14:21,806 --> 00:14:23,781
I'm expecting the offer
by lunchtime tomorrow.

195
00:14:23,855 --> 00:14:29,037
That means TV,
radio, publishing.
All of it.

196
00:14:29,998 --> 00:14:32,846
Are you as hot for me
right now as I am hot
for me right now?

197
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:33,892
So hot.

198
00:14:33,966 --> 00:14:35,111
And check it.

199
00:14:35,407 --> 00:14:39,051
Ted Vernon, the CEO himself,
is gonna fly in
for the end of the seminar.

200
00:14:39,118 --> 00:14:42,152
My guess,
a little warm and fuzzy
contract-inking party.

201
00:14:42,223 --> 00:14:43,565
Who knows?

202
00:14:43,631 --> 00:14:45,038
Your drinks, gentlemen.

203
00:14:45,584 --> 00:14:46,696
Thank you.

204
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:52,068
It's a long way
from booking you gigs

205
00:14:52,144 --> 00:14:54,565
writing columns
for Psychology Today, huh?

206
00:15:01,008 --> 00:15:02,950
I'll get you a Learjet.

207
00:15:03,696 --> 00:15:04,678
You like Learjets?

208
00:15:04,752 --> 00:15:05,930
Lane.

209
00:15:06,672 --> 00:15:09,323
Come on. You know
that's not why I wrote it.

210
00:15:11,088 --> 00:15:14,405
You do know that
you're helping people,
right, man?

211
00:15:18,384 --> 00:15:20,173
This is your moment.

212
00:15:20,912 --> 00:15:23,815
You have to give
yourself permission
to enjoy it, brother.

213
00:15:24,561 --> 00:15:27,016
Come on, man.
Live a little.

214
00:15:27,825 --> 00:15:28,808
Yeah.

215
00:15:28,881 --> 00:15:29,863
Yeah.

216
00:15:36,241 --> 00:15:37,354
What?

217
00:15:54,130 --> 00:15:55,624
You're right.

218
00:16:09,555 --> 00:16:11,344
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

219
00:16:11,923 --> 00:16:15,469
Hi. Do you remember me?
From the hallway upstairs?

220
00:16:15,539 --> 00:16:17,361
You dropped your pen.

221
00:16:19,123 --> 00:16:20,203
Um...

222
00:16:20,595 --> 00:16:23,246
Would you like to
have a cup of coffee?

223
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:29,128
Ah.

224
00:16:29,523 --> 00:16:30,734
Right. Um...

225
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:35,249
Well, we could bring
him along if you want.
Double your pleasure.

226
00:16:42,228 --> 00:16:44,912
I'm sorry.
I... I... You...

227
00:16:50,133 --> 00:16:51,278
See you, Ricky.

228
00:16:51,349 --> 00:16:52,429
Later, Eloise.

229
00:17:13,014 --> 00:17:15,697
Hey, baby. What's this?
Delivery.

230
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:17,299
Wow.
I was in the
neighborhood,

231
00:17:17,366 --> 00:17:18,675
so I figured
I'd bring you lunch

232
00:17:18,741 --> 00:17:20,684
'cause I knew you'd
be working so hard.

233
00:17:20,757 --> 00:17:21,706
Wow, you didn't
have to do that.

234
00:17:21,782 --> 00:17:23,124
Polished up,
ready to go.

235
00:17:23,190 --> 00:17:24,172
Hey, Eloise.

236
00:17:24,246 --> 00:17:25,293
Hi, Ian.

237
00:17:25,814 --> 00:17:27,472
How's your boss
treating you today?

238
00:17:27,542 --> 00:17:29,168
Oh, he's all right.

239
00:17:29,239 --> 00:17:32,337
The lead singer
of the Stereo Kings
trashed his Les Paul.

240
00:17:32,407 --> 00:17:35,407
Look at that
fretboard, man.
As good as new.

241
00:17:35,478 --> 00:17:36,624
Make sure
he signs for it.

242
00:17:36,695 --> 00:17:37,971
No problem.

243
00:17:39,127 --> 00:17:40,305
Did you have company?

244
00:17:41,878 --> 00:17:42,827
Um...

245
00:17:42,935 --> 00:17:46,284
Yeah. I told you
Frank and I were
working last night.

246
00:17:47,255 --> 00:17:48,815
Frank wears lipstick?

247
00:17:50,616 --> 00:17:52,307
Hey, listen.
EI, it's not
what you think.

248
00:17:52,376 --> 00:17:53,652
It's business.
Totally platonic.

249
00:17:53,719 --> 00:17:55,246
You know what?
You used
that one last time.

250
00:17:55,319 --> 00:17:57,905
No, she's got ties
to Sony. Hey!

251
00:17:57,976 --> 00:18:00,397
Listen to me.
You gotta listen
to me. Eloise!

252
00:18:00,472 --> 00:18:02,228
I don't want to hear it.

253
00:19:14,907 --> 00:19:16,084
How you
doing today?

254
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:17,530
Pretty good, thanks.

255
00:19:17,819 --> 00:19:19,445
All right. Okay.

256
00:19:21,595 --> 00:19:22,577
What's your name?

257
00:19:22,651 --> 00:19:23,633
Alberto.

258
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:25,881
See you at workshop,
okay? Goodbye.

259
00:19:25,948 --> 00:19:27,442
Mr. Ryan.

260
00:19:27,707 --> 00:19:29,846
You are something.
Yes, sir.

261
00:19:30,908 --> 00:19:34,803
Say, would you mind
signing that to
"Donald and Shirley," please?

262
00:19:35,644 --> 00:19:37,171
There you go.

263
00:19:37,244 --> 00:19:38,488
Say, do you mind
if I share?

264
00:19:38,908 --> 00:19:39,856
Share?

265
00:19:39,932 --> 00:19:42,485
Yeah. See, there's
this fellow in his 60s

266
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:46,004
and he thinks
he's just gonna, you know,
sail through his retirement.

267
00:19:46,077 --> 00:19:49,787
But then one day,
three years and
13 days ago,

268
00:19:49,853 --> 00:19:51,958
his daughter dies.

269
00:19:52,893 --> 00:19:56,090
And the truth is
he hasn't been
doing very well.

270
00:19:56,829 --> 00:20:00,310
He doesn't sleep much,
and he and his wife, well...

271
00:20:01,661 --> 00:20:03,188
You can understand.

272
00:20:03,261 --> 00:20:05,781
But his daughter's husband,

273
00:20:05,853 --> 00:20:07,063
well, he doesn't
seem to be having

274
00:20:07,133 --> 00:20:08,988
any of these kinds
of problems. No.

275
00:20:09,758 --> 00:20:14,165
She was crushed
to death in a car crash,
but he, well...

276
00:20:15,997 --> 00:20:20,340
He's making lemonade
out of lemons.
Isn't that how it goes?

277
00:20:28,063 --> 00:20:30,550
When are you gonna
stop lying, son?

278
00:20:34,558 --> 00:20:35,933
Hypocrite.

279
00:20:40,991 --> 00:20:43,675
Burke, I am so sorry.

280
00:20:44,863 --> 00:20:47,099
God. The balls on him!

281
00:20:47,167 --> 00:20:48,344
I'm fine.

282
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:51,476
Who does he think he is?

283
00:20:51,552 --> 00:20:52,795
Her father.

284
00:20:54,784 --> 00:20:57,271
Even so,
way over the line.

285
00:20:58,912 --> 00:21:02,076
Forget that.
You know what?
She'd be proud of you.

286
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,750
All right,
you're pissed off at me.

287
00:21:05,824 --> 00:21:09,239
A thousand times
you said no to Seattle,
but I wouldn't listen.

288
00:21:09,312 --> 00:21:11,646
You gotta be
pissed off at me.

289
00:21:13,248 --> 00:21:14,557
I'm fine.

290
00:21:20,128 --> 00:21:21,306
Burke?

291
00:21:29,569 --> 00:21:33,660
So, take a good
look at them, mister.
A little preview of tonight.

292
00:21:34,401 --> 00:21:36,922
I know how you love
the high heels.

293
00:21:38,465 --> 00:21:41,499
I'll see you tonight at 8:00.
Standing tall.

294
00:21:43,713 --> 00:21:45,055
Big kiss.

295
00:21:46,434 --> 00:21:47,711
Love you.

296
00:21:54,178 --> 00:21:56,447
"So, my ass don't
fit no Cosmo cover

297
00:21:56,514 --> 00:21:59,580
"You think I can't be
some hot animal lover?

298
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:04,091
"You scared of my
cerebral cortex? That I'm
Gloria's fish, chromosome X?

299
00:22:04,163 --> 00:22:09,019
"Or maybe you're just afraid
of my battery-operated sex"

300
00:22:11,810 --> 00:22:13,501
What do you think?

301
00:22:17,283 --> 00:22:18,298
Hello.

302
00:22:18,371 --> 00:22:20,378
There's something
wrong with that girl.

303
00:22:22,211 --> 00:22:24,033
She said
she wanted to hear it.

304
00:22:24,099 --> 00:22:27,514
Marty. Slam poetry,
coffee house.

305
00:22:27,587 --> 00:22:29,889
My shop, work. Please.

306
00:22:29,955 --> 00:22:31,384
Yes, ma'am.

307
00:22:31,459 --> 00:22:32,921
Are there any
new receivables?

308
00:22:32,996 --> 00:22:35,581
Just that
birthday arrangement
I told you about.

309
00:22:35,651 --> 00:22:37,146
Right. Great.

310
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:40,413
Marty, you did not
cauterize the stems.

311
00:22:40,484 --> 00:22:41,564
Oh.

312
00:22:42,276 --> 00:22:44,348
I was just about to.

313
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:45,827
You know what?
Here's what happens.

314
00:22:45,892 --> 00:22:50,399
The sap pollutes
the water and then
they die twice as fast.

315
00:22:50,468 --> 00:22:53,021
I know,
I know, I know, I know.
I'll get it. I promise.

316
00:22:53,092 --> 00:22:56,671
I don't understand this.
We have roses,
we have all of these.

317
00:22:56,741 --> 00:22:59,042
I mean, come on.
These are flowers
living out of water.

318
00:22:59,109 --> 00:23:00,483
Are you all right?

319
00:23:00,549 --> 00:23:04,805
Look, I just had a really...
I've had a really bad
couple of days, okay?

320
00:23:06,661 --> 00:23:07,872
Would you like to
talk to me about it?

321
00:23:07,941 --> 00:23:09,534
No, I don't.

322
00:23:11,045 --> 00:23:14,112
Because you weren't
this mad the last time
I forgot to cauterize.

323
00:23:18,086 --> 00:23:19,296
Tyler.

324
00:23:22,086 --> 00:23:23,231
And some groupie.

325
00:23:23,301 --> 00:23:24,284
Again?

326
00:23:24,358 --> 00:23:25,307
Yeah.

327
00:23:25,382 --> 00:23:27,324
No. No!

328
00:23:27,398 --> 00:23:28,991
I know. It's crazy.

329
00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:31,074
I can't believe it.

330
00:23:32,487 --> 00:23:35,204
God, you know what?
No, I can believe it.
I can totally believe it.

331
00:23:35,271 --> 00:23:37,376
Excuse me.
What does that mean?
What does that mean?

332
00:23:37,447 --> 00:23:38,494
It's so clear to me.

333
00:23:38,566 --> 00:23:39,515
Oh.

334
00:23:40,007 --> 00:23:42,428
It means that you
manage to choose guys

335
00:23:42,502 --> 00:23:44,869
that guarantee
that at some point,

336
00:23:44,935 --> 00:23:46,658
we are going to be
standing here

337
00:23:46,727 --> 00:23:48,385
having this same
conversation again.

338
00:23:48,455 --> 00:23:53,311
And you're gonna be
shocked at the outcome
of the relationship again.

339
00:23:53,383 --> 00:23:54,430
But most of all,

340
00:23:54,503 --> 00:23:59,621
I just hate seeing you
get so disappointed
and hurt every single time.

341
00:24:01,192 --> 00:24:02,337
Am I being too harsh?

342
00:24:02,408 --> 00:24:03,837
Yes. No.

343
00:24:07,176 --> 00:24:08,158
Yeah.

344
00:24:08,232 --> 00:24:10,370
Yeah. Okay, I'm gonna...

345
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:12,197
Cauterize.
Yeah.

346
00:24:18,825 --> 00:24:21,574
It was because
they were feeling
pain and resentment.

347
00:24:21,641 --> 00:24:24,674
I want you to re-read
Chapter 12, okay?

348
00:24:24,744 --> 00:24:29,316
The cigarettes are
more than just a habit.
They're a denial mechanism.

349
00:24:29,385 --> 00:24:30,334
Oh.

350
00:24:30,409 --> 00:24:31,554
Okay?

351
00:24:33,161 --> 00:24:35,071
"Mental health
begins with..."

352
00:24:35,145 --> 00:24:37,535
"Physical health." Okay.

353
00:24:37,609 --> 00:24:40,479
And how you always say
it's important to
remember the person,

354
00:24:40,554 --> 00:24:43,074
how they lived,
not how they died?

355
00:24:43,145 --> 00:24:46,920
Well, my husband loved
my oatmeal-raisin
cookies so much.

356
00:24:46,985 --> 00:24:48,993
So, I took his ashes and...

357
00:24:51,146 --> 00:24:52,706
Meet my Stanley.

358
00:24:57,930 --> 00:25:00,069
Don't those
look delicious?

359
00:25:02,731 --> 00:25:04,803
I'll see you in workshop.

360
00:25:06,026 --> 00:25:07,652
Oh, thank him.

361
00:25:18,635 --> 00:25:21,024
...event next week
in the Junior Ballroom.

362
00:25:21,227 --> 00:25:23,300
But then Julie was wondering
if we could get the side...

363
00:25:23,371 --> 00:25:24,549
Excuse me.
...arrangements.
Excuse...

364
00:25:24,619 --> 00:25:28,231
Oh, my God. Oh, my God,
there's been a healing.

365
00:25:29,964 --> 00:25:31,557
You like making
a fool of people,

366
00:25:31,628 --> 00:25:33,089
pretending
to be Helen Keller?

367
00:25:33,163 --> 00:25:37,386
Uh, well, technically,
she was blind also, so...

368
00:25:37,452 --> 00:25:40,038
Okay. Will you
excuse us for a second?

369
00:25:41,228 --> 00:25:42,341
Thank you.

370
00:25:42,412 --> 00:25:45,608
See, I happen to know
a thing or two about people.

371
00:25:45,676 --> 00:25:46,920
You get approached a lot.

372
00:25:46,988 --> 00:25:49,444
Probably have since the day
you strapped on your
first training bra.

373
00:25:49,517 --> 00:25:53,259
But you're smart
and you're creative
and you're caring and deep.

374
00:25:53,324 --> 00:25:56,172
But how come
the guys only see
the package it comes in?

375
00:25:56,237 --> 00:25:59,172
Sure, you're flattered,
but ultimately,
ultimately, it's tiresome

376
00:25:59,245 --> 00:26:01,099
because it has
nothing to do with you.
You were born that way.

377
00:26:01,165 --> 00:26:04,426
You can't take credit for it.
Your insides, though.
That's yours.

378
00:26:04,493 --> 00:26:07,908
That's what you want
someone to truly see,
even a stranger.

379
00:26:07,981 --> 00:26:11,080
Ergo, you fake a handicap

380
00:26:11,150 --> 00:26:15,078
rather than deign
to have a conversation
with a fellow human being.

381
00:26:15,149 --> 00:26:17,418
You prefer sign language?
Fine.

382
00:26:28,174 --> 00:26:30,476
Smooth. Real smooth.

383
00:26:33,262 --> 00:26:34,211
Ha!

384
00:26:35,055 --> 00:26:36,680
Excuse me.
This is the men's room.

385
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:38,605
You know what?
Excuse me.

386
00:26:38,927 --> 00:26:40,934
What did you have in mind?

387
00:26:41,007 --> 00:26:43,909
Some sweet,
romantic courtship

388
00:26:43,983 --> 00:26:45,576
in the bar
over some warm peanuts

389
00:26:45,647 --> 00:26:49,095
before we consummate
our love in the glow
of Spectravision porn?

390
00:26:49,167 --> 00:26:50,149
You...

391
00:26:50,223 --> 00:26:52,743
God, I'm so sorry
your little ego
took such a bruising.

392
00:26:52,815 --> 00:26:57,038
But you know what?
I bet the next chick that
you meet in the elevator

393
00:26:57,103 --> 00:26:59,013
or, I don't know, the gym,

394
00:26:59,088 --> 00:27:01,160
is gonna fit
that bill just fine.
Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm.

395
00:27:01,231 --> 00:27:04,330
Even though I bet
you have a wife who is
actually stupid enough

396
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:07,531
to believe that
you're the one guy
with integrity. The one guy.

397
00:27:07,599 --> 00:27:10,666
Until, of course,
she finds that lipstick mark
on your boxers,

398
00:27:10,736 --> 00:27:12,558
and then it's
game over, pal.

399
00:27:12,624 --> 00:27:13,868
And that one thing
that you held so dear,

400
00:27:13,936 --> 00:27:16,009
that one thing
that you loved more than
anything in the world,

401
00:27:16,081 --> 00:27:19,528
is tainted and ruined
and destroyed like that.

402
00:27:21,008 --> 00:27:23,529
Ergo, if you had
a brain in either head,

403
00:27:23,601 --> 00:27:26,022
you would realize that
I was doing us both a favor.

404
00:27:35,665 --> 00:27:36,614
Excuse me.

405
00:27:36,689 --> 00:27:37,737
Sure. No problem.

406
00:27:41,617 --> 00:27:42,861
Is that my flower
you're wearing?

407
00:27:43,601 --> 00:27:44,681
No.

408
00:27:46,450 --> 00:27:48,752
Yes. Yes, yes, yes, it is.

409
00:27:51,057 --> 00:27:54,538
But I... I took it before,
when I thought you were deaf.

410
00:27:55,410 --> 00:27:56,490
Hmm?

411
00:27:56,562 --> 00:27:58,187
Not that I would steal
from a deaf person.

412
00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:00,330
All right.

413
00:28:01,650 --> 00:28:02,894
Goodbye.

414
00:28:05,426 --> 00:28:06,921
My God.

415
00:28:20,403 --> 00:28:22,542
All right,
this one's ready.

416
00:28:23,059 --> 00:28:24,620
Where's that headed?
Don't know.

417
00:28:24,691 --> 00:28:27,310
He said you'd know
where it was going.

418
00:28:50,261 --> 00:28:51,341
Hi.

419
00:28:52,885 --> 00:28:53,899
Hi.

420
00:28:54,805 --> 00:28:55,852
Don't you look grand?

421
00:28:55,925 --> 00:28:58,707
Thank you.
My, my, fancy.

422
00:28:59,733 --> 00:29:01,642
Thank you.
All right.

423
00:29:05,461 --> 00:29:08,047
The concierge
said it's good.

424
00:29:08,501 --> 00:29:10,290
That's good.
He should know.

425
00:29:10,741 --> 00:29:12,017
Yeah.

426
00:29:19,158 --> 00:29:20,402
It stopped raining.

427
00:29:20,758 --> 00:29:22,001
It sure did.

428
00:29:27,254 --> 00:29:30,288
Carrot-ginger and
the spinach soup.

429
00:29:34,166 --> 00:29:36,305
You know, I have to say,
I have never been
on a date with someone

430
00:29:36,374 --> 00:29:38,578
who has a cardboard
cutout of themselves.

431
00:29:38,646 --> 00:29:39,923
Well, I mean, they're...
They're really...

432
00:29:39,990 --> 00:29:41,812
They're good
for the carpool lane.

433
00:29:42,391 --> 00:29:43,339
Oh.

434
00:29:44,790 --> 00:29:45,805
Got it.

435
00:29:45,879 --> 00:29:49,774
You know, we take long walks
on the beach together,
go fly kites.

436
00:29:50,327 --> 00:29:51,821
He's the kite.

437
00:29:52,727 --> 00:29:54,636
Because he's cardboard.
Right.

438
00:29:58,967 --> 00:30:01,040
Your salads. Enjoy.

439
00:30:01,111 --> 00:30:02,485
Thank you.
Thank you.

440
00:30:05,176 --> 00:30:06,223
So...

441
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,196
"Quidnunc"?

442
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:12,437
Yeah.

443
00:30:13,016 --> 00:30:16,661
You weren't really
supposed to see that,
but, you know...

444
00:30:16,728 --> 00:30:19,183
They're just...
They're just words.

445
00:30:20,344 --> 00:30:22,101
So, there's
more than one, or...

446
00:30:22,169 --> 00:30:23,117
Mmm-mmm.

447
00:30:33,273 --> 00:30:34,615
Thank you.

448
00:30:39,353 --> 00:30:42,387
Well, your
concierge called it.
That was real good.

449
00:30:42,457 --> 00:30:43,635
Right.
Thank you.

450
00:30:43,706 --> 00:30:45,135
My pleasure.

451
00:30:46,457 --> 00:30:49,524
So, I gotta...
I'm gonna go.
I've got...

452
00:30:49,594 --> 00:30:51,382
It's a school night
for me, so...

453
00:30:51,449 --> 00:30:52,562
I understand.

454
00:30:52,634 --> 00:30:53,844
It was very nice.
Thank you. Okay.

455
00:30:53,913 --> 00:30:55,604
All right.
Thank you. Great.

456
00:30:55,674 --> 00:30:57,846
Goodbye.
See you later. Thanks.

457
00:31:04,090 --> 00:31:05,367
Eloise!

458
00:31:06,970 --> 00:31:07,919
Eloise!

459
00:31:07,995 --> 00:31:08,943
Oh.

460
00:31:12,283 --> 00:31:16,211
You know, I haven't...
I haven't been on a date
in three years.

461
00:31:17,466 --> 00:31:20,184
'Cause see, I was...
I was married.

462
00:31:20,251 --> 00:31:25,336
And I mean, normally,
I'm... I'm quite
dashing and debonair

463
00:31:25,403 --> 00:31:28,120
and whatever other
"D" word there is

464
00:31:28,187 --> 00:31:29,136
that would
really impress you.

465
00:31:29,211 --> 00:31:32,081
But it's painfully
apparent that I'm...
I'm a little rusty.

466
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:36,980
Why... Why wouldn't you
just say so?

467
00:31:37,883 --> 00:31:40,339
I don't know,
a desperate attempt
to hold on to

468
00:31:40,412 --> 00:31:42,779
whatever shred of masculinity
that I have left?

469
00:31:44,252 --> 00:31:45,681
Okay. So...

470
00:31:47,964 --> 00:31:51,161
So then I'm your...
I'm your first
since a divorce?

471
00:31:52,252 --> 00:31:55,122
Uh, you are the first...
Well, that's good.

472
00:31:55,197 --> 00:31:58,579
Because that explains a lot.
Because that in there...

473
00:31:59,677 --> 00:32:00,986
It was... It was bad.

474
00:32:01,053 --> 00:32:02,263
Really bad.

475
00:32:04,381 --> 00:32:08,724
Well, I have to go
pick some phalangiums
right now.

476
00:32:08,797 --> 00:32:11,098
Would you like to
come with me?

477
00:32:12,093 --> 00:32:13,041
Yeah.

478
00:32:13,661 --> 00:32:14,610
Good.

479
00:32:24,126 --> 00:32:27,639
Personally, I like
to put the waffles
and bacon in first.

480
00:32:28,126 --> 00:32:29,882
I'm increasing
the pH level.

481
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:32,187
Hey. You do your thing.

482
00:32:33,342 --> 00:32:37,237
I'm still trying to
wrap my head around
what your thing is.

483
00:32:37,310 --> 00:32:39,765
You're just gonna
have to read my book.

484
00:32:39,838 --> 00:32:41,399
You're slippery.

485
00:32:41,535 --> 00:32:43,128
I prefer "mysterious."

486
00:32:47,423 --> 00:32:48,600
How long you
been at this?

487
00:32:48,670 --> 00:32:50,459
Oh, I've always
wanted to do it.

488
00:32:51,199 --> 00:32:54,068
I finally got up the guts
a couple of years ago
to open my own shop.

489
00:32:54,143 --> 00:32:55,637
Good for you.

490
00:32:58,367 --> 00:33:00,342
"Julie, we have
never met..."

491
00:33:00,415 --> 00:33:02,008
No. Hey!

492
00:33:02,079 --> 00:33:03,934
Wow. Nosy.

493
00:33:04,991 --> 00:33:06,006
I'm sorry.

494
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:07,127
Sorry. I don't mean to...

495
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:10,778
But these are just...
They're from deliveries.

496
00:33:10,847 --> 00:33:13,630
They're copies I've made
of cards that have,

497
00:33:13,696 --> 00:33:15,321
you know, stuck with me.

498
00:33:16,896 --> 00:33:18,238
So...
Can I...

499
00:33:18,304 --> 00:33:20,028
Really?
Would you...
Yeah. I'd like to.

500
00:33:20,096 --> 00:33:21,143
Okay.

501
00:33:21,824 --> 00:33:24,377
"Julie, we have never met,

502
00:33:26,145 --> 00:33:29,145
"but I've watched
you lovingly
all these years.

503
00:33:29,217 --> 00:33:32,533
"Congratulations
and have a beautiful wedding.

504
00:33:34,177 --> 00:33:35,966
"Love, your father."

505
00:33:40,289 --> 00:33:41,500
May I?

506
00:33:41,666 --> 00:33:42,713
Um...

507
00:33:47,681 --> 00:33:49,055
Let's see.

508
00:33:49,121 --> 00:33:53,050
"Stacy, these are supposed
to last two weeks.

509
00:33:53,122 --> 00:33:55,511
"I'll be back in time
to see them bloom."

510
00:33:55,586 --> 00:33:58,685
Yeah, deployed Marine.
He never saw them bloom.

511
00:34:04,355 --> 00:34:05,402
One last one.

512
00:34:05,474 --> 00:34:07,962
"My dearest wife,
happy 50th anniversary.

513
00:34:08,035 --> 00:34:09,922
"Sorry about
the rug burns last night."

514
00:34:11,650 --> 00:34:13,538
Thanks for the visual.

515
00:34:15,107 --> 00:34:16,798
Life on a 3-by-5.

516
00:34:32,771 --> 00:34:36,033
Okay, well,
I mean, if this is
the candle of truth,

517
00:34:39,012 --> 00:34:41,346
then I guess
I should be honest.

518
00:34:44,164 --> 00:34:46,685
I... I used her
life insurance money

519
00:34:48,740 --> 00:34:51,457
for a down payment
on a condo in Mexico.

520
00:34:52,453 --> 00:34:56,250
Well, because we had
talked about it before.
He liked the idea.

521
00:34:57,060 --> 00:35:02,243
So, I... I made
a mold of his, you know...

522
00:35:04,036 --> 00:35:08,292
That way, when he was gone,
we could still, you know...

523
00:35:11,845 --> 00:35:13,252
Who's next?

524
00:35:19,334 --> 00:35:20,544
Walter?

525
00:35:24,101 --> 00:35:26,076
Not much to say, really.

526
00:35:27,781 --> 00:35:31,360
Walter, there's always
something to say.
Come on, tell us.

527
00:35:33,318 --> 00:35:34,747
How did your son die?

528
00:35:45,062 --> 00:35:48,707
I used to be a contractor.
He was my little
right-hand man.

529
00:35:50,279 --> 00:35:55,167
Only 12, but he could
frame a garden shed
better than I could.

530
00:35:56,359 --> 00:35:57,985
We stopped by my
construction site.

531
00:35:58,055 --> 00:36:00,444
I had to pick up
some blueprints
from my trailer.

532
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:02,276
I told him to
wait in the car.

533
00:36:02,343 --> 00:36:05,889
He fell off a scaffold
and snapped his
spinal cord in two.

534
00:36:19,048 --> 00:36:20,477
Just like...

535
00:36:22,312 --> 00:36:23,872
Just like that.

536
00:36:26,793 --> 00:36:28,418
And every day...

537
00:36:30,696 --> 00:36:32,257
Every day is...

538
00:36:36,233 --> 00:36:39,168
I should've known
he wouldn't stay
in the car.

539
00:36:46,217 --> 00:36:49,513
Walter, you said,
"I used to be a contractor."

540
00:36:55,753 --> 00:36:58,983
I can't even walk
into a hardware store.

541
00:37:01,738 --> 00:37:05,055
I clean buildings
at night now.

542
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:09,792
And I lost my business.

543
00:37:11,114 --> 00:37:12,740
My wife left me.

544
00:37:16,907 --> 00:37:18,598
Thank you, Walter.

545
00:37:25,931 --> 00:37:29,346
There's a dirty
little secret.
It's fear.

546
00:37:31,051 --> 00:37:33,418
How many here
don't fly anymore?

547
00:37:34,507 --> 00:37:36,547
Come on, raise your hands.

548
00:37:37,164 --> 00:37:40,360
Who here gets
an annual checkup
three times a year?

549
00:37:43,436 --> 00:37:45,225
How many of you
don't take elevators

550
00:37:45,292 --> 00:37:49,351
or gave up skiing,
biking, surfing, kayaking,
whatever it might be?

551
00:37:51,788 --> 00:37:56,610
Well, listen to me.
Fear is a state of mind.

552
00:37:58,156 --> 00:38:00,523
We're gonna prove
that right now.

553
00:38:02,381 --> 00:38:04,585
Let's put
our hands together.

554
00:38:08,621 --> 00:38:11,108
Ready? Here we go.

555
00:38:14,670 --> 00:38:16,677
Step, step, step, step.

556
00:38:18,125 --> 00:38:20,067
Okay? Come on, Natalie.

557
00:38:37,967 --> 00:38:41,644
The only thing
separating you and me
is in your head.

558
00:38:41,710 --> 00:38:44,874
Come on.
You can do this.
Come on.

559
00:38:46,287 --> 00:38:48,425
Okay. Walter?

560
00:38:49,198 --> 00:38:51,784
-Come on, Walter!
-Come on, Walter!

561
00:38:51,983 --> 00:38:53,324
Here we go!

562
00:38:53,391 --> 00:38:55,049
Come on, Walter!

563
00:38:58,607 --> 00:38:59,949
Here we go.

564
00:39:00,015 --> 00:39:01,902
Come on, Walter!

565
00:39:02,735 --> 00:39:03,979
Come on!

566
00:39:04,495 --> 00:39:05,705
Walter.

567
00:39:06,639 --> 00:39:08,134
It's okay. It's okay.

568
00:39:08,208 --> 00:39:11,241
I'm sorry.
This is just silly.

569
00:39:11,312 --> 00:39:12,741
I'm not gonna
feel A-Okay

570
00:39:12,816 --> 00:39:14,703
because I walked
across some damn coals.

571
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:17,898
Okay, then it shouldn't be
that big of a deal, Walter.

572
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,461
It's not a big deal.
It's just...

573
00:39:19,536 --> 00:39:20,965
It's a step.

574
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:22,928
It's an important step.

575
00:39:23,696 --> 00:39:26,892
Well, it has nothing
to do with my Stephen.

576
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:29,710
Walter, would Stephen
want you like this?

577
00:39:30,801 --> 00:39:34,216
Or would he
want you to move on,
to take a step forward?

578
00:39:36,497 --> 00:39:38,798
You don't know
anything about my son.

579
00:39:38,865 --> 00:39:40,425
Walter, watch.

580
00:39:52,497 --> 00:39:54,155
Walter, come on.

581
00:40:02,642 --> 00:40:04,944
Come on, Walter.
You can do this.

582
00:40:07,955 --> 00:40:09,264
Come on.

583
00:40:10,418 --> 00:40:11,728
Walter!

584
00:40:17,139 --> 00:40:19,986
Okay. All right,
we all go at our own pace.

585
00:40:20,787 --> 00:40:22,380
He'll get there.

586
00:40:23,379 --> 00:40:25,167
All right, well,
let's give ourselves
a round of applause

587
00:40:27,059 --> 00:40:29,993
for daring to kick fear
right where it hurts.

588
00:40:33,620 --> 00:40:36,784
Buddy, this stuff
is gonna hurt.

589
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:44,147
How many layers of skin
do you think you have?

590
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:47,241
Not enough.

591
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:52,719
You know, you can't
do the work for them.

592
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:54,635
You know that, right?

593
00:40:54,708 --> 00:40:56,082
The guy needs help.

594
00:40:57,269 --> 00:40:59,374
Fine, but you can't
do it for them.

595
00:41:00,564 --> 00:41:01,906
This is gonna
sting a little bit.

596
00:41:03,637 --> 00:41:04,815
Ready?

597
00:41:06,709 --> 00:41:08,236
Count of three.

598
00:41:08,917 --> 00:41:09,899
One.

599
00:41:11,253 --> 00:41:13,424
Lane! You're fired!

600
00:41:16,822 --> 00:41:19,986
Once you sign
with us, you're no longer
an independent contractor.

601
00:41:20,054 --> 00:41:23,666
You've got all 32 divisions
funneling your image 24-7.

602
00:41:23,734 --> 00:41:27,924
Within a year, well
increase your household
name recognition by 65%.

603
00:41:27,990 --> 00:41:31,405
The Burke Ryan Show
will subsequently launch
in the third quarter.

604
00:41:31,478 --> 00:41:33,650
Followed by
the DVD line,
a new set of books,

605
00:41:33,718 --> 00:41:35,922
syndicated
talk radio, et cetera.

606
00:41:36,086 --> 00:41:37,166
"Et cetera" is good.

607
00:41:37,238 --> 00:41:40,238
All of this
lays the foundation
for a branding strategy

608
00:41:40,310 --> 00:41:43,093
that taps into demographics
well beyond your current base.

609
00:41:43,158 --> 00:41:45,973
Studies indicate
that persons grieving
the loss of a loved one

610
00:41:46,038 --> 00:41:49,355
put on 30 to 40%
more weight than
the national average.

611
00:41:49,430 --> 00:41:53,554
Introducing
the Burke Ryan
Calorie Reduction Plan.

612
00:41:54,647 --> 00:41:58,062
"Finally, a loss you
can feel good about."

613
00:41:58,167 --> 00:41:59,312
Ooh.

614
00:42:00,247 --> 00:42:02,669
Look at that.
I like that picture.

615
00:42:04,376 --> 00:42:06,612
Wow. Are you kidding me?

616
00:42:08,312 --> 00:42:09,556
You look strong,
you look happy and...

617
00:42:09,624 --> 00:42:10,639
Right.

618
00:42:10,711 --> 00:42:13,526
It's a mock-up at this point.
Anyway, continuing on...

619
00:42:41,081 --> 00:42:42,772
Hey, that was great.
Don't forget,

620
00:42:42,841 --> 00:42:44,881
when Mr. Vernon
gets into town...

621
00:42:44,953 --> 00:42:46,644
Hey, I gotta take them
down to the museum

622
00:42:46,714 --> 00:42:48,819
and show them
around like an idiot...

623
00:42:49,369 --> 00:42:54,039
Did that beep?
Hey, Burke.
It's me, Eloise.

624
00:42:57,593 --> 00:42:59,088
So, where are we going?

625
00:42:59,226 --> 00:43:00,720
It's all good.
You'll see.

626
00:43:11,194 --> 00:43:14,129
Okay, I will be right back.

627
00:43:14,938 --> 00:43:16,564
Is this...
Is this your house?

628
00:43:16,634 --> 00:43:17,844
No, it's my mom's.

629
00:43:17,914 --> 00:43:20,281
I'm just gonna
go grab something.

630
00:43:21,242 --> 00:43:22,649
I mean, you're
more than welcome
to come in.

631
00:43:22,715 --> 00:43:23,925
Okay.

632
00:43:25,339 --> 00:43:26,451
Okay.

633
00:43:28,155 --> 00:43:29,169
Hi, Mom.

634
00:43:29,243 --> 00:43:30,520
Oh. Hi, honey.

635
00:43:30,683 --> 00:43:32,144
Bob left the keys
on the counter.

636
00:43:32,219 --> 00:43:33,648
Oh, great.

637
00:43:34,683 --> 00:43:36,309
Great. How was your day?

638
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:38,900
Oh, fine. I had
lots of coupons.

639
00:43:38,971 --> 00:43:41,360
Oh, really?
So, that was busy, huh?

640
00:43:41,724 --> 00:43:42,672
Mmm-hmm.

641
00:43:43,708 --> 00:43:46,075
Hi. I brought you flowers.

642
00:43:46,140 --> 00:43:48,507
Oh. Those are
so pretty. Thanks.

643
00:43:49,468 --> 00:43:52,436
Mom, I'd like you
to meet a friend of mine.

644
00:43:52,508 --> 00:43:54,580
I wasn't expecting company.

645
00:43:55,516 --> 00:43:58,037
Hi. I'm Burke.

646
00:43:59,100 --> 00:44:00,627
Burke Ryan!

647
00:44:01,660 --> 00:44:03,864
Ellie, you didn't tell me
you were dating a celebrity.

648
00:44:03,932 --> 00:44:05,842
Well, we're not dating.

649
00:44:06,429 --> 00:44:08,120
I wish you would have told me.
I look like hell.

650
00:44:08,189 --> 00:44:10,327
Not at all.
It's just the opposite.

651
00:44:10,396 --> 00:44:12,436
I see where Eloise
gets her looks.

652
00:44:14,557 --> 00:44:15,866
Let's show him
your pictures.

653
00:44:15,933 --> 00:44:16,915
You know,
no, I don't think so...

654
00:44:16,989 --> 00:44:17,938
I'd love to.

655
00:44:18,013 --> 00:44:19,475
No, really.

656
00:44:20,989 --> 00:44:23,739
You know... Okay,
I'm gonna get the keys.

657
00:44:23,805 --> 00:44:26,075
My word, you have
Pocahontas here.

658
00:44:26,142 --> 00:44:29,044
Eloise was state
archery champion
two years in a row.

659
00:44:29,118 --> 00:44:30,547
No.
Oh, Mother.

660
00:44:30,622 --> 00:44:33,371
Don't be modest.
This is Burke Ryan.

661
00:44:35,230 --> 00:44:37,467
I loved you
on The Today Show.

662
00:44:38,462 --> 00:44:39,869
Now how old is she here?

663
00:44:39,934 --> 00:44:41,876
Okay. I got those keys,
so thank you for that.

664
00:44:41,950 --> 00:44:43,805
We gotta go.
Look how cute
you are here.

665
00:44:43,870 --> 00:44:45,812
A-Okay.
A-Okay.

666
00:44:46,142 --> 00:44:47,703
It was very nice
meeting you.
Nice to meet you.

667
00:44:47,775 --> 00:44:50,196
Hope to see you again.
Yeah. Take care. Bye-bye.

668
00:44:51,519 --> 00:44:53,526
I am so glad
you're not dating
that musician.

669
00:44:53,598 --> 00:44:54,907
Mother. Oh, God.

670
00:44:59,615 --> 00:45:01,622
I love you.
Thanks. Thank Bob.

671
00:45:03,296 --> 00:45:05,303
Burke Ryan.
Oh, my God!

672
00:45:06,559 --> 00:45:08,021
Wow.
She's so sweet.

673
00:45:08,096 --> 00:45:09,340
She loves you.

674
00:45:09,408 --> 00:45:10,520
I really enjoyed that.

675
00:45:10,591 --> 00:45:12,086
It was very sweet.

676
00:45:14,048 --> 00:45:17,528
Oh, Mom. No, no, no.
This way. Come on.

677
00:45:18,528 --> 00:45:20,088
Where are we going?

678
00:45:20,992 --> 00:45:22,421
It's fun not knowing,
isn't it?

679
00:45:22,496 --> 00:45:23,445
Ah.

680
00:45:23,552 --> 00:45:25,178
Youll see.

681
00:45:27,488 --> 00:45:29,660
What, are you trying
to avoid the FBI?

682
00:45:29,728 --> 00:45:32,695
Youll see. Please,
just get in the truck.

683
00:45:39,553 --> 00:45:40,829
I think I forgot
my hard hat.

684
00:45:40,896 --> 00:45:43,198
Oh, really?
Well, here you go.

685
00:46:02,113 --> 00:46:03,739
What you doing?

686
00:46:04,322 --> 00:46:06,559
Your chariot awaits.

687
00:46:07,970 --> 00:46:10,240
Seriously?
Me, in bucket?

688
00:46:10,914 --> 00:46:12,769
Yes. Trust me.

689
00:46:16,867 --> 00:46:19,518
Have you had any
cold medicine today?

690
00:46:19,587 --> 00:46:21,081
Not today.

691
00:46:21,155 --> 00:46:22,584
We're good.
Okay, now watch this.

692
00:46:22,659 --> 00:46:24,186
Very dangerous.
Fingers.
Uh-huh.

693
00:46:24,259 --> 00:46:26,495
Lock us in. Got it?

694
00:46:26,563 --> 00:46:27,708
Do you know
what you're doing?
Uh-huh.

695
00:46:27,779 --> 00:46:28,827
Ready?
Oh, Lord.

696
00:46:28,899 --> 00:46:30,076
Are we in? Buckled?

697
00:46:30,147 --> 00:46:31,576
Locked? Loaded?
Okay.

698
00:46:33,219 --> 00:46:36,765
All right, here lies
Burke Ryan, dead...

699
00:46:37,667 --> 00:46:41,497
Oh, stop it.
I had a crash course
this morning from Bob.

700
00:46:41,572 --> 00:46:43,906
Who is Bob, and why is
my life in his hands?

701
00:46:43,972 --> 00:46:46,011
Bob's my mom's neighbor.

702
00:46:46,083 --> 00:46:48,189
Current boyfriend
of the moment.

703
00:46:48,260 --> 00:46:49,689
Mmm-hmm.

704
00:46:50,308 --> 00:46:52,097
Okay. Here's
what I was thinking.

705
00:46:52,228 --> 00:46:54,051
I wanted to pick up
from last night.

706
00:46:55,204 --> 00:46:57,593
And I wanted to
get you tickets
to Rogue Wave,

707
00:46:57,668 --> 00:47:00,189
but they've been
sold out for weeks.

708
00:47:01,284 --> 00:47:05,594
So, I figured
where there is a will,
there is a way.

709
00:47:20,773 --> 00:47:23,261
Heaven is a switchboard
that you want to fight

710
00:47:23,333 --> 00:47:25,505
She would even miss you
if you taught her sight

711
00:47:25,574 --> 00:47:27,745
Power politician
leaning to the right

712
00:47:27,813 --> 00:47:31,523
Baby's got a trust fund
that she'll want to go off
like that

713
00:47:31,590 --> 00:47:33,892
Get off my stack

714
00:47:33,958 --> 00:47:35,649
leave a little window

715
00:47:35,718 --> 00:47:38,533
Get off of my stack

716
00:47:46,022 --> 00:47:47,845
Now we wear
same-colored yellow uniforms

717
00:47:47,911 --> 00:47:49,121
Sky is burning
but at least we're warm

718
00:47:58,151 --> 00:48:00,158
If I had a nickel
for every time
I saw a concert

719
00:48:00,231 --> 00:48:02,468
from a telephone truck,
I'd be...

720
00:48:03,399 --> 00:48:05,538
Thank you.
It was exquisite.

721
00:48:05,607 --> 00:48:07,363
Don't thank me.
Thank Bob.

722
00:48:07,431 --> 00:48:08,805
Thank you, Bob.

723
00:48:09,607 --> 00:48:11,429
Hey, I got your book.

724
00:48:11,496 --> 00:48:12,444
I'm halfway through it.

725
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:13,600
Really?

726
00:48:14,215 --> 00:48:16,769
Well, wait till you get
to the recipe chapters.

727
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:18,563
They're top-notch.

728
00:48:22,088 --> 00:48:24,095
I'm sorry
about your wife.

729
00:48:25,672 --> 00:48:28,225
How come you didn't tell me
that's what happened?

730
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:32,612
I don't know.
Never came up.

731
00:48:35,176 --> 00:48:37,565
Well, it sounded like
you really loved her.

732
00:48:39,241 --> 00:48:40,670
Yeah, I did.

733
00:48:42,473 --> 00:48:43,967
But that was
a long time ago.

734
00:48:45,289 --> 00:48:46,718
Three years?

735
00:48:47,401 --> 00:48:49,124
Twenty-one in dog years.

736
00:48:53,513 --> 00:48:57,091
I had a really,
really great time.

737
00:48:57,961 --> 00:49:00,066
Me, too.
That was really fun.

738
00:49:13,611 --> 00:49:14,854
What?

739
00:49:15,242 --> 00:49:18,984
I'm waiting
to watch you strut back
to your bitchin' rig.

740
00:49:22,826 --> 00:49:24,103
All right.

741
00:49:25,483 --> 00:49:26,432
Bye.

742
00:50:02,356 --> 00:50:05,226
Is that the international
song for "got laid"?

743
00:50:05,812 --> 00:50:07,242
No! Hardly.

744
00:50:07,637 --> 00:50:10,801
Come on, throw me a bone.
What happened last night?

745
00:50:11,252 --> 00:50:12,681
It was fun.

746
00:50:13,461 --> 00:50:15,403
So, are you going
to see him again?

747
00:50:15,477 --> 00:50:17,965
I don't know. Maybe.

748
00:50:20,694 --> 00:50:24,752
May I just point out
that you broke up
with Tyler 72 hours ago

749
00:50:24,822 --> 00:50:26,480
and now you're dating
some other guy

750
00:50:26,550 --> 00:50:28,689
who's not even gonna be
in town for 72 hours?

751
00:50:28,758 --> 00:50:29,935
Can I just point that out?

752
00:50:30,005 --> 00:50:32,078
Okay, we're...
We're not dating.

753
00:50:32,469 --> 00:50:37,390
We just met and,
you know, I like him.

754
00:50:38,870 --> 00:50:40,692
We're just hanging out.

755
00:50:41,686 --> 00:50:43,541
Well, just be careful.

756
00:50:44,246 --> 00:50:46,897
Men are hairy.

757
00:50:47,990 --> 00:50:49,746
Thank you for that.

758
00:52:33,883 --> 00:52:36,250
Two minutes.
Give him two minutes.

759
00:52:37,339 --> 00:52:39,444
He gets called away
for emergencies, you know.

760
00:52:46,427 --> 00:52:49,591
"Her freckles frame eyes
the color of mermaid's tears

761
00:52:49,659 --> 00:52:53,369
"Her ears like waking up
to the sound of
children at play"

762
00:52:53,436 --> 00:52:56,568
"My first five senses are
reeling like an old-school
cassette tape

763
00:52:56,636 --> 00:52:59,985
"rewound and played
electric relaxation all day"

764
00:53:00,061 --> 00:53:03,738
"You and your phallus
may run this world

765
00:53:03,804 --> 00:53:08,376
"But this Amazon bitch
will cut you down to size!"

766
00:53:10,940 --> 00:53:12,315
Thank you.

767
00:53:19,485 --> 00:53:21,176
That was slamming.

768
00:53:21,534 --> 00:53:23,955
Thank you.
I tried to mix up
the iambic pentameter

769
00:53:24,029 --> 00:53:26,200
with a little
haiku motif.

770
00:53:26,270 --> 00:53:28,604
Kick-ass, Mart. Drink?

771
00:53:28,669 --> 00:53:30,076
Yeah, all around, on me.

772
00:53:30,141 --> 00:53:34,070
And can we have more
of the Istanbul Black
Demon shisha, please?

773
00:53:34,142 --> 00:53:35,156
Black Demon?

774
00:53:35,229 --> 00:53:37,618
Thank you. So wicked.
Want to try it?

775
00:53:37,694 --> 00:53:38,807
-Go ahead, try it.
-Okay.

776
00:53:38,878 --> 00:53:40,088
"Try me."

777
00:53:42,078 --> 00:53:43,223
Sure.

778
00:53:56,254 --> 00:53:59,254
Shit. Excuse me
for one second,
will you?

779
00:53:59,455 --> 00:54:01,113
Who is that man?

780
00:54:07,360 --> 00:54:09,913
I beg you, please
make sense of this.

781
00:54:10,144 --> 00:54:12,031
I'm just enjoying
a little local flavor.

782
00:54:12,095 --> 00:54:14,462
Since when do you
enjoy anything?

783
00:54:14,528 --> 00:54:15,935
How did you even find me?

784
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,389
I'm Lane goddamn Marshall,
okay?

785
00:54:19,584 --> 00:54:20,991
You asked directions
from your concierge.

786
00:54:21,056 --> 00:54:22,103
What is going on here?

787
00:54:22,175 --> 00:54:24,542
We're on the verge
of the deal
of the century here

788
00:54:24,608 --> 00:54:26,135
and you're off playing
Prince of Persia.

789
00:54:26,208 --> 00:54:27,964
Drinks, gentlemen?
No. Get out of here.

790
00:54:28,032 --> 00:54:29,526
Hey, Lane.

791
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:31,901
No, thank you.
Will you calm down?

792
00:54:31,969 --> 00:54:33,725
I will not calm down.

793
00:54:33,792 --> 00:54:36,280
Their CEO is coming
in two days.

794
00:54:37,825 --> 00:54:40,214
Do you have any idea
the blood, sweat and tears

795
00:54:40,289 --> 00:54:42,623
it's taken me to put
this thing together?

796
00:54:42,688 --> 00:54:45,274
You know, Unicom didn't
even know your name
six months ago.

797
00:54:45,345 --> 00:54:46,555
I know and I appreciate it.

798
00:54:47,041 --> 00:54:47,989
No, you don't.
Yes, I do.

799
00:54:48,065 --> 00:54:50,105
No, you don't!
Lane.

800
00:54:50,177 --> 00:54:51,770
Friend to friend,

801
00:54:53,537 --> 00:54:55,360
do you not want this?

802
00:55:00,610 --> 00:55:01,951
You can tell me.

803
00:55:05,922 --> 00:55:08,988
Look, I'm ready.

804
00:55:09,569 --> 00:55:10,617
Okay?

805
00:55:10,690 --> 00:55:11,672
So, for the next two days,
you're gonna be

806
00:55:11,746 --> 00:55:13,884
where I tell you to be
when I tell you to be there?

807
00:55:15,074 --> 00:55:16,732
Yes. Scout's honor.

808
00:55:17,795 --> 00:55:19,583
You with the scouting.

809
00:55:20,450 --> 00:55:21,727
Oh, God.

810
00:55:22,722 --> 00:55:24,064
Will you relax?
You're gonna have
a heart attack.

811
00:55:24,130 --> 00:55:26,978
I had a heart attack.
I had four heart attacks
on the way here.

812
00:55:30,082 --> 00:55:33,050
So, who are these
fine folks that you're
consorting with?

813
00:55:34,019 --> 00:55:37,183
Just people I've met.

814
00:55:38,883 --> 00:55:39,930
Yeah?

815
00:55:43,108 --> 00:55:44,701
Her name's Eloise.

816
00:55:44,995 --> 00:55:47,930
Well, what hath
struck the earth?
Details.

817
00:55:50,020 --> 00:55:51,296
She's...

818
00:55:53,444 --> 00:55:54,556
Yeah?

819
00:55:58,372 --> 00:56:00,063
That's great.
Yeah.

820
00:56:00,132 --> 00:56:01,114
That's great.

821
00:56:01,188 --> 00:56:02,268
So, I'm gonna get back.

822
00:56:02,340 --> 00:56:03,747
Yeah, we'd better.

823
00:56:09,060 --> 00:56:13,217
All right, yo,
a pleasure to meet you guys.
Welcome to the rainy city.

824
00:56:14,885 --> 00:56:16,860
Should I belly dance?

825
00:57:31,753 --> 00:57:35,528
It's tragic.
They were so young.

826
00:57:35,593 --> 00:57:36,869
It's just so sad.

827
00:57:36,936 --> 00:57:37,919
I know.

828
00:57:38,376 --> 00:57:41,311
I don't know how you
deal with all that
death every day.

829
00:57:41,385 --> 00:57:43,719
Well, I have to deal
with it no matter what.

830
00:57:44,969 --> 00:57:49,028
I think that
funerals are archaic
and a waste of money.

831
00:57:49,640 --> 00:57:54,594
Actually, funerals
are an important ritual
in the grieving process.

832
00:57:55,561 --> 00:57:58,790
They don't just recognize
that a life has ended.

833
00:57:58,857 --> 00:58:01,607
They recognize
that a life was lived.

834
00:58:02,602 --> 00:58:04,390
My wife's funeral...

835
00:58:05,001 --> 00:58:06,463
Burke, you don't
have to.

836
00:58:06,538 --> 00:58:07,520
No, it's okay.
That's okay.

837
00:58:07,594 --> 00:58:12,067
Which was actually
here in Seattle,
was a celebration.

838
00:58:12,554 --> 00:58:14,441
It was a beautiful day
in March,

839
00:58:14,506 --> 00:58:16,033
St. Patrick's Day, actually.

840
00:58:16,106 --> 00:58:18,081
And her family
has a little plot,

841
00:58:18,154 --> 00:58:20,041
so we set up
chairs and candles.

842
00:58:20,107 --> 00:58:24,035
And it had been raining
for two weeks straight.
Pouring.

843
00:58:24,106 --> 00:58:26,179
But on that day,
the sun came out.

844
00:58:26,251 --> 00:58:27,876
The dahlias were
blooming in the ground

845
00:58:27,946 --> 00:58:29,473
as if they were
welcoming her.

846
00:58:29,547 --> 00:58:32,297
It was... It was magic.

847
00:58:35,627 --> 00:58:37,961
That was a healing
for my family.

848
00:58:45,643 --> 00:58:46,920
Dahlias?

849
00:58:49,292 --> 00:58:50,568
Dahlias.

850
00:58:51,372 --> 00:58:53,958
Dahlias. That was
her favorite flower.

851
00:58:56,652 --> 00:58:59,270
Dahlias don't bloom
here until the fall.

852
00:59:01,356 --> 00:59:03,876
Well, maybe they were
early that year.

853
00:59:04,556 --> 00:59:05,866
It's getting late.

854
00:59:05,933 --> 00:59:07,755
We should hit
the road, Burke.

855
00:59:21,901 --> 00:59:23,047
He didn't go, did he?

856
00:59:32,781 --> 00:59:33,959
No.

857
01:00:29,968 --> 01:00:30,916
Oh.

858
01:00:31,696 --> 01:00:33,419
So beautiful here.

859
01:00:35,056 --> 01:00:37,806
Look. Look, you can
see my parents' house.

860
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:40,455
Right... Yeah, right there.

861
01:00:42,193 --> 01:00:43,753
Okay, your turn.

862
01:00:44,016 --> 01:00:46,984
Big smile. Time for
that tourist snapshot.

863
01:00:47,729 --> 01:00:49,933
It's gonna go
right on the wall
in the living room.

864
01:00:52,945 --> 01:00:55,214
You're not smiling.
Would you smile, please?

865
01:00:56,209 --> 01:00:59,690
Okay, three, two, one.

866
01:01:00,337 --> 01:01:01,711
Say "cheese."

867
01:01:59,028 --> 01:02:01,843
Recovery starts with
acceptance, Olivia.

868
01:02:01,908 --> 01:02:04,756
I think you're
well on your way.
Okay. Good.

869
01:02:04,948 --> 01:02:06,704
Who's next? Anybody?

870
01:02:07,700 --> 01:02:09,937
Come on, people,
this is what these
smaller sessions are for.

871
01:02:10,005 --> 01:02:11,947
Let's get our hands up.
Come on, participate.

872
01:02:15,124 --> 01:02:16,685
Martha, please.

873
01:02:18,325 --> 01:02:19,307
I don't know. I...

874
01:02:19,381 --> 01:02:21,421
No, Martha, "I don't know"
never got anybody anywhere.

875
01:02:21,493 --> 01:02:23,882
So, please,
this is your assessment.

876
01:02:24,789 --> 01:02:27,091
Let's make
the most of it, okay?

877
01:02:28,469 --> 01:02:30,771
I think
I'm coming to terms
with some of my anger.

878
01:02:30,837 --> 01:02:32,299
Good.
And I'm gonna try

879
01:02:32,373 --> 01:02:33,900
to stop projecting it
onto others.

880
01:02:33,973 --> 01:02:36,145
Fine. Work on that
in group this afternoon.

881
01:02:36,214 --> 01:02:38,931
All right?
All right, next. Anybody.

882
01:02:41,526 --> 01:02:44,046
Come on, people.
Walter, how about you?

883
01:02:46,582 --> 01:02:48,557
I feel I'm getting
a lot out of the seminar.

884
01:02:48,630 --> 01:02:50,321
Like what?

885
01:02:50,966 --> 01:02:53,421
Come on, there's
no right answer here.
Open up.

886
01:02:54,390 --> 01:02:55,600
Well...

887
01:02:57,047 --> 01:02:58,508
It's just...

888
01:03:00,502 --> 01:03:02,958
It still hurts.

889
01:03:03,030 --> 01:03:05,845
Okay, that's a given, Walter.
What are you doing about it?

890
01:03:07,062 --> 01:03:08,077
I'm trying.

891
01:03:08,151 --> 01:03:11,566
No, Walter. I don't think that
you're trying hard enough.

892
01:03:11,639 --> 01:03:13,166
I don't know
how to try any harder.

893
01:03:13,239 --> 01:03:14,865
You don't know how?

894
01:03:15,095 --> 01:03:17,364
You don't know how?
Have I not been up here
the last three days?

895
01:03:17,431 --> 01:03:18,609
Have you not been
listening to me?

896
01:03:18,680 --> 01:03:20,141
I mean, you don't know
how, Walter?

897
01:03:20,215 --> 01:03:21,557
No, I...
Then spit it out!

898
01:03:21,623 --> 01:03:23,216
Come on, what is it?
What is it?

899
01:03:23,287 --> 01:03:24,498
You want to know what?

900
01:03:24,568 --> 01:03:26,575
He should be pitching
Little League right now.

901
01:03:27,416 --> 01:03:29,871
If he'd stayed in the car,
he'd be playing video games,

902
01:03:29,944 --> 01:03:31,767
he'd be spray-painting
his skateboard,

903
01:03:31,832 --> 01:03:33,588
he'd be pissing me off
by being a kid,

904
01:03:33,656 --> 01:03:34,965
but he's never
gonna do any of that

905
01:03:35,032 --> 01:03:37,007
because he's
in a goddamn box!

906
01:04:13,561 --> 01:04:14,838
Walter.

907
01:04:18,714 --> 01:04:20,274
You're stuck.

908
01:04:21,850 --> 01:04:23,192
You can't move
forward because

909
01:04:23,258 --> 01:04:25,330
you've got your eyes
on the rearview mirror.

910
01:04:27,514 --> 01:04:31,289
The death of your son has
become the death of you,

911
01:04:32,283 --> 01:04:36,058
your marriage,
your job. Everything.

912
01:04:38,523 --> 01:04:39,952
It's just...

913
01:04:43,419 --> 01:04:45,655
I don't know
how to get it back.

914
01:04:49,116 --> 01:04:50,676
You're a contractor, right?

915
01:04:53,691 --> 01:04:54,706
Build it.

916
01:04:55,580 --> 01:04:57,271
One brick at a time.

917
01:05:01,948 --> 01:05:03,225
Watch your step.
Little field trip today.

918
01:05:03,900 --> 01:05:05,362
Thank you.
Hi. How you doing, Brenda?

919
01:05:05,436 --> 01:05:07,608
Good. Trust me.

920
01:05:20,893 --> 01:05:22,715
All right, follow me.

921
01:05:26,205 --> 01:05:28,824
Wait right around
the corner, Lorraine.
Thanks.

922
01:05:30,333 --> 01:05:31,348
Now, watch your step.

923
01:05:31,421 --> 01:05:33,625
I'll see you
out there, okay?

924
01:05:35,102 --> 01:05:38,331
Okay.
You all right there? Okay.

925
01:05:38,397 --> 01:05:39,346
Thanks.

926
01:05:40,382 --> 01:05:41,494
I'm not going out there.

927
01:05:43,774 --> 01:05:45,716
I can't go out there.

928
01:05:48,190 --> 01:05:52,249
Walter. You're not a janitor.

929
01:05:52,958 --> 01:05:54,071
You're a contractor.

930
01:06:01,631 --> 01:06:03,005
After you.

931
01:06:16,288 --> 01:06:18,459
Now let's fill
this thing up.

932
01:06:22,559 --> 01:06:24,632
All right, gang, lets go.

933
01:08:35,621 --> 01:08:37,629
He'd have gotten
a kick out of this.

934
01:08:44,166 --> 01:08:49,469
Thank you
for reminding me.

935
01:08:51,014 --> 01:08:53,218
You reminded
yourself, Walter.

936
01:08:56,103 --> 01:08:57,859
I couldn't hold him.

937
01:08:59,398 --> 01:09:01,635
At the end,
I couldn't hold him.

938
01:09:03,079 --> 01:09:06,821
The paramedics said
not to move him, so...

939
01:09:10,759 --> 01:09:12,701
I want you to have this.

940
01:09:18,088 --> 01:09:19,975
Beautiful boy, Walter.

941
01:09:25,192 --> 01:09:27,264
If you ever need
a remodel.

942
01:09:55,080 --> 01:09:56,903
I'll be right there.

943
01:10:00,649 --> 01:10:03,878
I didn't go to her funeral.
And I...

944
01:10:04,681 --> 01:10:08,293
Look, I haven't spoken
to her parents since I...

945
01:10:08,970 --> 01:10:10,279
Yeah, I didn't
take care of Rocky.

946
01:10:10,345 --> 01:10:11,622
I stopped talking
to her friends.

947
01:10:11,690 --> 01:10:14,985
I threw out everything
that even smelled of her. I...

948
01:10:17,674 --> 01:10:21,154
Listen, I wasn't judging you
or trying to trip you up.

949
01:10:24,074 --> 01:10:25,863
Can I say something?

950
01:10:26,730 --> 01:10:30,473
And this comes
from a place of
total humility.

951
01:10:31,243 --> 01:10:32,803
With the acknowledgment
that my life

952
01:10:32,874 --> 01:10:38,439
is a day-by-day experiment
in really bad decisions.

953
01:10:40,523 --> 01:10:41,668
But...

954
01:10:43,243 --> 01:10:45,130
You're really messed up.

955
01:10:46,955 --> 01:10:48,614
I mean, maybe
you need someone

956
01:10:48,684 --> 01:10:52,066
to nudge you
to do these things that
you don't want to do,

957
01:10:52,139 --> 01:10:56,809
like talk to her parents
or take care of Rocky,

958
01:10:57,483 --> 01:10:59,076
whatever Rocky is.

959
01:10:59,852 --> 01:11:01,194
What is Rocky?

960
01:11:01,260 --> 01:11:02,373
It's a parrot.

961
01:11:02,444 --> 01:11:03,458
Parrot?

962
01:11:03,532 --> 01:11:04,907
Her parrot.

963
01:11:05,356 --> 01:11:07,179
He's loud and he shits
all over the place.

964
01:11:08,908 --> 01:11:10,250
It's a parrot.

965
01:11:12,652 --> 01:11:13,601
She made me promise

966
01:11:13,676 --> 01:11:17,353
that if anything ever
happened to her that I'd...

967
01:11:19,533 --> 01:11:21,387
I mean, it sounds...
It's crazy.
What?

968
01:11:21,453 --> 01:11:24,998
That I would release him
into the wild.

969
01:11:26,189 --> 01:11:27,847
And you haven't
done that, have you?

970
01:11:28,621 --> 01:11:32,069
No. No,
her parents took him.

971
01:11:35,085 --> 01:11:36,841
Didn't you say
her parents live here?

972
01:11:38,510 --> 01:11:39,458
Mmm-hmm.

973
01:11:39,981 --> 01:11:41,508
Two birds, one stone.

974
01:11:41,582 --> 01:11:43,305
Come on.
Eloise, no.

975
01:11:43,373 --> 01:11:45,316
Why?
Because it's her...

976
01:11:45,645 --> 01:11:47,052
Her father...

977
01:11:47,118 --> 01:11:48,940
Hmm...
No, you know...

978
01:11:49,262 --> 01:11:50,855
It's just... It's more
complicated than that.

979
01:11:50,926 --> 01:11:53,130
I'm sure it's... I'm sure
it's very complicated.

980
01:11:53,198 --> 01:11:55,271
Eloise, no.

981
01:12:06,479 --> 01:12:07,940
So, that's it.

982
01:12:08,143 --> 01:12:09,637
That's it.

983
01:12:10,671 --> 01:12:11,619
Do you want me to...

984
01:12:11,695 --> 01:12:14,565
Do you want me
to go with you or... No.

985
01:12:14,735 --> 01:12:17,453
I don't think that would
go over so well.

986
01:12:19,951 --> 01:12:22,537
Look, you know what?
I don't even know
if they're home.

987
01:12:22,608 --> 01:12:24,495
They probably didn't
even keep the bird.

988
01:12:25,328 --> 01:12:26,505
Burke.

989
01:12:35,728 --> 01:12:37,386
Did I mention
that her father
is an ex-Marine?

990
01:12:37,456 --> 01:12:39,114
Ex-Marine. Yeah.

991
01:13:18,130 --> 01:13:20,432
All right, now.
So, you add in some of these
mega-mergers

992
01:13:20,498 --> 01:13:22,538
that we're talking about.
BHP...

993
01:13:43,091 --> 01:13:44,913
That's right.
Guess who.

994
01:13:44,979 --> 01:13:48,013
You never thought
you'd see me again,
did you?

995
01:13:57,716 --> 01:14:01,011
Another damn commercial.
How about some
fresh tea, hon?

996
01:14:01,076 --> 01:14:02,450
Oh, thanks.

997
01:14:10,964 --> 01:14:13,298
What the hell's
going on with you?

998
01:14:14,133 --> 01:14:15,856
Huh? What are you
up to now?

999
01:14:15,924 --> 01:14:17,004
What, honey?

1000
01:14:17,076 --> 01:14:18,254
I'm talking to Rocky.

1001
01:14:19,317 --> 01:14:20,299
Honey,
don't tease him.

1002
01:14:20,372 --> 01:14:21,899
You know it gets him...
I'm not teasing him.

1003
01:14:21,972 --> 01:14:24,525
He was doing the damn
car alarm again.

1004
01:14:25,973 --> 01:14:27,827
Honey, could you
get me some
lemon, please?

1005
01:14:27,893 --> 01:14:28,907
What?

1006
01:14:28,981 --> 01:14:30,356
Could you get
some lemon, please?

1007
01:14:30,421 --> 01:14:31,435
Yes, it's right here.

1008
01:14:31,509 --> 01:14:32,720
Shut up!

1009
01:14:33,621 --> 01:14:36,043
Just don't cut yourself
when you're slicing it.

1010
01:14:36,118 --> 01:14:38,354
I won't cut myself.
Don't worry.

1011
01:14:51,606 --> 01:14:53,362
Go! Go! Go!

1012
01:14:54,326 --> 01:14:55,406
Start it up, go!

1013
01:14:55,478 --> 01:14:56,525
What's going on?

1014
01:14:56,598 --> 01:14:57,907
Go. Just drive.

1015
01:14:57,974 --> 01:14:59,022
What?

1016
01:14:59,094 --> 01:15:00,207
Go. Just drive.

1017
01:15:00,278 --> 01:15:01,227
I'm going. I'm going.
Just drive!

1018
01:15:01,302 --> 01:15:03,244
Come on, lets get
out of here. Go, go!

1019
01:15:03,318 --> 01:15:04,944
Go, go, go, go!

1020
01:15:06,550 --> 01:15:08,373
Jesus, what happened?

1021
01:15:08,439 --> 01:15:10,578
I got the bird.
That's all that matters.

1022
01:15:10,647 --> 01:15:13,036
Oh, God. Were they...
Were they that upset?

1023
01:15:13,111 --> 01:15:14,288
They will be.

1024
01:15:14,359 --> 01:15:15,407
What?

1025
01:15:19,479 --> 01:15:21,999
What happened to
"two birds, one stone"?

1026
01:15:22,071 --> 01:15:23,380
One bird's all
I could manage.

1027
01:15:23,448 --> 01:15:25,815
Eloise, they never would've
given me that bird.

1028
01:15:25,880 --> 01:15:27,571
Trust me.
You don't know that.

1029
01:15:27,640 --> 01:15:29,101
I cut my losses.

1030
01:15:29,175 --> 01:15:30,255
If she wanted this
bird turned loose,

1031
01:15:30,328 --> 01:15:31,605
this is the way
to get it done.

1032
01:15:34,648 --> 01:15:36,339
Okay. All right.

1033
01:15:56,664 --> 01:15:59,698
This isn't animal cruelty
or something, is it?

1034
01:16:02,522 --> 01:16:04,725
It wasn't my idea.
It was your idea.

1035
01:16:04,794 --> 01:16:07,379
It wasn't my idea.
It was her idea.

1036
01:16:08,857 --> 01:16:11,029
Well, lets let him decide.

1037
01:16:53,148 --> 01:16:54,293
Okay.

1038
01:16:57,980 --> 01:17:02,136
This looks like a good place,
so I guess this is goodbye.

1039
01:17:04,892 --> 01:17:06,037
Go on.

1040
01:17:06,812 --> 01:17:08,819
Come on, Rocky.
Fly away.

1041
01:17:09,564 --> 01:17:11,670
Come on, lets go!
Giddyup!

1042
01:17:12,988 --> 01:17:15,923
You'll see the world.
Come on. Meet some girls.

1043
01:17:20,477 --> 01:17:21,819
No, come on.

1044
01:17:22,429 --> 01:17:24,283
Go on, get out of here.

1045
01:17:25,021 --> 01:17:26,843
No, Rock. Come on. Go.

1046
01:17:27,549 --> 01:17:28,826
Come here.

1047
01:17:32,413 --> 01:17:34,551
Fly away.
Rocky, look at me.

1048
01:17:38,333 --> 01:17:40,504
Giddyup! Giddyup!

1049
01:17:42,685 --> 01:17:45,238
All right,
now you're pissing me off.

1050
01:17:45,886 --> 01:17:47,479
You want to go back
to Semper Fi's house?

1051
01:17:49,150 --> 01:17:50,840
All right, you know what?
You're on your own.

1052
01:19:11,361 --> 01:19:12,703
How'd it go?

1053
01:19:13,281 --> 01:19:14,972
Mission accomplished.

1054
01:19:15,041 --> 01:19:16,503
Was he happy?

1055
01:19:19,106 --> 01:19:20,415
Are you happy?

1056
01:19:23,746 --> 01:19:26,201
It's a bird.
I set it free.

1057
01:19:28,098 --> 01:19:29,047
Oh.

1058
01:19:37,186 --> 01:19:39,009
I need you to take me
back to the hotel.

1059
01:19:39,715 --> 01:19:40,892
Okay.

1060
01:19:43,715 --> 01:19:45,504
I feel better
for having done it, okay?

1061
01:19:45,571 --> 01:19:48,637
Listen, you don't have to
talk about it if you
don't want to. Really.

1062
01:19:48,707 --> 01:19:49,852
Just tell me what to say
and I'll say it.

1063
01:19:49,923 --> 01:19:50,905
No.

1064
01:19:51,267 --> 01:19:52,477
I don't... I don't know.
I'm not good...

1065
01:19:52,547 --> 01:19:54,238
I haven't thought
this through.

1066
01:19:55,491 --> 01:19:58,459
You know, Burke,
I like you. I like you.

1067
01:19:59,299 --> 01:20:00,576
Not the author.

1068
01:20:01,092 --> 01:20:02,368
Not the guy
with the microphone.

1069
01:20:02,435 --> 01:20:04,093
And I just...
I just want to help.

1070
01:20:05,348 --> 01:20:07,770
You know what, Eloise,
I just...

1071
01:20:08,612 --> 01:20:11,776
I need you to take me
back to the hotel, right now,

1072
01:20:12,196 --> 01:20:13,789
and I need you
to respect that.
Burke, I will...

1073
01:20:13,860 --> 01:20:16,860
Damn it!
You just don't know
when to quit, do you?

1074
01:20:16,933 --> 01:20:19,682
I asked you to stop
and you just keep on.

1075
01:20:20,548 --> 01:20:23,036
Maybe you're the one
who needs psychoanalysis.

1076
01:20:23,108 --> 01:20:25,050
Leave me alone,
all right?

1077
01:20:27,333 --> 01:20:29,504
I can catch
my own ride back.

1078
01:21:13,543 --> 01:21:15,233
It's about time.

1079
01:21:15,783 --> 01:21:17,922
Oh, my God!
Where the hell
have you been?

1080
01:21:17,991 --> 01:21:19,584
It's not important.
Uh-huh.

1081
01:21:19,655 --> 01:21:21,215
Well, let me
tell you something
that is important.

1082
01:21:21,287 --> 01:21:23,229
You blew off dinner
and Vernon's here.

1083
01:21:23,303 --> 01:21:24,448
I mean, Jesus,
you have got to...

1084
01:21:24,519 --> 01:21:25,796
Lane!

1085
01:21:29,640 --> 01:21:32,258
I'll meet with him
first thing in the morning,
make sure he feels the love.

1086
01:21:32,327 --> 01:21:34,269
You, meanwhile,
accept their offer,

1087
01:21:34,343 --> 01:21:35,837
but tell them the DVD
rollout is too late.

1088
01:21:35,911 --> 01:21:37,537
I want it bumped up
to next month.

1089
01:21:39,560 --> 01:21:40,804
Jesus.

1090
01:21:42,280 --> 01:21:44,451
What the hell
happened to you, man?

1091
01:21:44,520 --> 01:21:46,014
I can't wait to
get out of this city.

1092
01:21:47,625 --> 01:21:48,770
Hey!

1093
01:21:49,704 --> 01:21:50,816
Is everything cool?

1094
01:21:50,888 --> 01:21:52,383
Absolutely.

1095
01:21:52,456 --> 01:21:54,758
Yeah? Anything of note
happen this afternoon?

1096
01:21:54,824 --> 01:21:55,773
Not particularly.

1097
01:21:55,849 --> 01:21:56,994
What about Eloise?

1098
01:21:57,288 --> 01:22:00,550
Stop! Wait! Listen to me.

1099
01:22:01,577 --> 01:22:04,993
You know, you can
talk to me if you want to.

1100
01:22:06,730 --> 01:22:09,828
I know. I get all mixed up.
I get caught up
in this business shit,

1101
01:22:09,897 --> 01:22:11,686
but I want you to know

1102
01:22:13,257 --> 01:22:15,428
that I'm there for you
if you need me to be.

1103
01:22:18,569 --> 01:22:19,780
She's gone.

1104
01:22:19,946 --> 01:22:21,539
She's gone?
What do you mean,
she's gone?

1105
01:22:23,754 --> 01:22:26,056
I don't know, man, I just...

1106
01:22:26,122 --> 01:22:27,683
I screwed it up.

1107
01:22:29,322 --> 01:22:32,835
I threw all my...
All my bullshit in her face.

1108
01:22:34,954 --> 01:22:36,962
It could've been something.

1109
01:22:38,634 --> 01:22:40,423
Night, Lane.
Burke.

1110
01:22:41,387 --> 01:22:43,045
Sleep well.
Big day tomorrow.

1111
01:22:43,114 --> 01:22:44,096
Burke.

1112
01:22:45,867 --> 01:22:47,143
Burke.

1113
01:23:03,787 --> 01:23:04,900
She'd be
proud of you.

1114
01:23:04,972 --> 01:23:05,954
I didn't go
to her funeral.

1115
01:23:06,028 --> 01:23:07,010
Hypocrite.

1116
01:23:07,084 --> 01:23:08,131
You're stuck.

1117
01:23:08,204 --> 01:23:09,731
You can't move
forward because

1118
01:23:09,804 --> 01:23:11,265
you've got your eyes
on the rearview mirror.

1119
01:23:11,340 --> 01:23:12,420
You're
really messed up.

1120
01:23:12,492 --> 01:23:13,801
Swerved into a pole.

1121
01:23:13,868 --> 01:23:15,526
She died instantly.

1122
01:23:18,860 --> 01:23:21,479
When are you gonna stop
lying, son?

1123
01:24:05,102 --> 01:24:07,110
Good morning, sire.
This way.

1124
01:24:07,183 --> 01:24:08,165
What happened to you?

1125
01:24:08,239 --> 01:24:10,126
Went for a little run.
It's refreshing.

1126
01:24:10,190 --> 01:24:13,802
You know, Vernon went
for the international
and DVD rollout.

1127
01:24:13,870 --> 01:24:16,805
Yeah. Old man
likes what he sees
and we are Rolls-Royce.

1128
01:24:16,879 --> 01:24:18,156
Get it done.
First things first,

1129
01:24:18,223 --> 01:24:20,808
I need you to
shake some hands
with somebody here.

1130
01:24:22,191 --> 01:24:23,620
Mr. Vernon,
it's a pleasure...

1131
01:24:32,048 --> 01:24:33,870
Lane goddamn Marshall.

1132
01:24:39,600 --> 01:24:40,844
Well,

1133
01:24:43,760 --> 01:24:45,549
this is unexpected.

1134
01:24:50,352 --> 01:24:51,726
I'm sorry.

1135
01:24:53,200 --> 01:24:56,681
Lane told me the truth.

1136
01:25:01,553 --> 01:25:05,230
You don't deserve
what you put
yourself through.

1137
01:25:08,305 --> 01:25:10,029
I hope that
you can find a way

1138
01:25:10,098 --> 01:25:12,945
to somehow give
yourself a break

1139
01:25:14,353 --> 01:25:17,931
because if you don't,
this is... This is
gonna be your life.

1140
01:25:20,850 --> 01:25:22,705
I just think that's...

1141
01:25:24,690 --> 01:25:26,414
That's just sad.

1142
01:25:30,002 --> 01:25:31,825
That's it. That's...

1143
01:25:32,914 --> 01:25:34,824
That's all I came to say.

1144
01:25:42,419 --> 01:25:45,419
So, just take care
of yourself, okay?

1145
01:26:04,596 --> 01:26:06,221
How's about it,
folks, huh?

1146
01:26:07,411 --> 01:26:10,129
Has it been a week
of miracles or what?

1147
01:26:13,780 --> 01:26:17,839
How many of you
can't get enough
of Burke Ryan?

1148
01:26:19,796 --> 01:26:22,666
I bet that you
would love to see him

1149
01:26:22,740 --> 01:26:25,839
in your living room
from 3:00 p.m.
to 4:00 p.m. every day

1150
01:26:25,908 --> 01:26:27,599
on your local
syndicated channel.

1151
01:26:27,668 --> 01:26:30,254
Huh? Yes!

1152
01:26:32,309 --> 01:26:34,765
We'll see what we
can do about that.

1153
01:26:34,836 --> 01:26:40,750
Now, without further ado,
the man of the hour,
Burke Ryan.

1154
01:26:58,262 --> 01:27:00,629
Thank you.
Please have a seat.

1155
01:27:01,750 --> 01:27:04,052
Thank you.
Have a seat, please.

1156
01:27:06,198 --> 01:27:07,573
Gosh, I'm...

1157
01:27:09,143 --> 01:27:10,899
I'm feeling okay.
How are you?

1158
01:27:10,966 --> 01:27:12,428
A-Okay!

1159
01:27:16,567 --> 01:27:17,844
Sir, I need to
see your badge.

1160
01:27:17,911 --> 01:27:19,471
I'm sorry, what?
Sir, your badge.

1161
01:27:19,543 --> 01:27:22,413
I got a badge.
He's a damn thief,
you know.

1162
01:27:22,743 --> 01:27:24,204
Son of a bitch
broke into my house
and took something.

1163
01:27:24,279 --> 01:27:25,588
There's your badge.
You can keep it.

1164
01:27:25,655 --> 01:27:26,703
You keep it!

1165
01:27:26,776 --> 01:27:30,037
We have made
a lot of progress
in the last few days,

1166
01:27:31,224 --> 01:27:32,817
but don't forget,

1167
01:27:33,559 --> 01:27:35,217
it's just a foundation
for the future.

1168
01:27:40,056 --> 01:27:41,463
Excuse me.

1169
01:27:49,720 --> 01:27:52,622
You know...
Boy, I'm sorry.

1170
01:27:56,889 --> 01:27:58,547
I... I've...

1171
01:28:03,768 --> 01:28:06,005
I can't lie
to you guys anymore.

1172
01:28:10,745 --> 01:28:12,600
You know, I stand here

1173
01:28:14,874 --> 01:28:17,743
and I watch you all
confront your pain.

1174
01:28:21,657 --> 01:28:23,151
And I envy you

1175
01:28:24,793 --> 01:28:26,135
because

1176
01:28:29,338 --> 01:28:31,345
I haven't confronted mine.

1177
01:28:38,138 --> 01:28:40,375
I didn't want it
to be my fault.

1178
01:28:41,339 --> 01:28:43,127
My wife's accident.

1179
01:28:45,275 --> 01:28:46,835
It was raining.

1180
01:28:48,667 --> 01:28:50,074
This dog

1181
01:28:55,708 --> 01:28:57,846
in the middle of the road.

1182
01:29:00,475 --> 01:29:02,199
We had been arguing

1183
01:29:04,219 --> 01:29:07,602
over paint colors
for the kitchen.

1184
01:29:11,292 --> 01:29:12,721
Paint colors.

1185
01:29:19,004 --> 01:29:21,175
But what I haven't told you

1186
01:29:29,020 --> 01:29:31,476
is that I was
driving the car,

1187
01:29:34,909 --> 01:29:36,087
not her.

1188
01:29:43,901 --> 01:29:45,527
I killed my wife.

1189
01:29:57,502 --> 01:29:59,324
I'm so sorry.

1190
01:30:09,375 --> 01:30:11,546
It was just
an accident, son.

1191
01:30:16,575 --> 01:30:18,168
That's all it was.

1192
01:30:29,311 --> 01:30:31,100
There was nothing
you could have done.

1193
01:30:31,167 --> 01:30:32,116
No.

1194
01:30:32,191 --> 01:30:33,140
No, it's true.

1195
01:30:33,216 --> 01:30:36,063
It was just one of those
freak accidents.

1196
01:30:36,544 --> 01:30:39,195
Listen to me.
We never blamed you.

1197
01:30:40,448 --> 01:30:41,725
Never.

1198
01:30:42,079 --> 01:30:45,243
All we really wanted to do
was mourn with you, son.

1199
01:30:45,312 --> 01:30:48,126
We didn't know what to do.
We couldn't find you.

1200
01:30:48,192 --> 01:30:50,297
That's been the worst part.

1201
01:30:59,041 --> 01:31:00,502
It's okay.

1202
01:32:13,924 --> 01:32:17,339
Hey. Come here.

1203
01:32:21,220 --> 01:32:25,311
I was thinking that maybe
I should've had you do that
a long time ago.

1204
01:32:28,964 --> 01:32:30,175
You gonna be all right?

1205
01:32:30,245 --> 01:32:31,587
Yeah, in time.

1206
01:32:31,717 --> 01:32:34,368
Mr. Ryan? Ted Vernon.

1207
01:32:35,429 --> 01:32:37,850
That was something.

1208
01:32:39,301 --> 01:32:41,210
Yeah, that was
something, huh?

1209
01:32:41,285 --> 01:32:44,132
That was reality
up there, Mr. Vernon.

1210
01:32:44,198 --> 01:32:47,264
And if you can't accept
that for what it is,

1211
01:32:47,333 --> 01:32:50,977
then you can take
your deal and you can
shove it up your ass.

1212
01:32:54,661 --> 01:32:59,483
I found it refreshing
and I respect you for it.

1213
01:33:03,430 --> 01:33:04,772
Thank you.

1214
01:33:05,478 --> 01:33:07,005
I'm sorry. Are we still...

1215
01:33:07,335 --> 01:33:08,317
We'll see.

1216
01:33:09,607 --> 01:33:10,948
This is why
you keep firing me.

1217
01:33:11,015 --> 01:33:12,837
I'll be right back.
Mr. Vernon?

1218
01:33:28,135 --> 01:33:31,201
There's something
I don't think
you ever realized.

1219
01:33:31,559 --> 01:33:33,381
As far as
we were concerned,

1220
01:33:33,447 --> 01:33:35,270
we didn't just
lose our daughter.

1221
01:33:35,911 --> 01:33:37,635
We also lost our son.

1222
01:33:39,880 --> 01:33:40,829
I'm sorry.

1223
01:33:41,095 --> 01:33:42,044
We understand.

1224
01:33:43,784 --> 01:33:47,100
And she would want you
to just get on
with your life.

1225
01:33:48,232 --> 01:33:49,955
And don't be a stranger.

1226
01:33:50,024 --> 01:33:52,774
But next time
make sure you use
the front door.

1227
01:33:52,840 --> 01:33:54,564
I will. I promise.

1228
01:33:55,272 --> 01:33:58,851
And listen.
Thank you, son.
Thank you.

1229
01:33:59,592 --> 01:34:01,021
Look, I should have done this
a long time ago.

1230
01:34:01,097 --> 01:34:03,431
No, no, no,
not about that.

1231
01:34:03,497 --> 01:34:05,504
For getting rid
of that damn bird.

1232
01:34:07,177 --> 01:34:08,125
I love you, kid.

1233
01:34:08,201 --> 01:34:09,379
I love you, too.

1234
01:36:53,328 --> 01:36:55,695
Hey, I got your bear grass.

1235
01:36:55,760 --> 01:36:57,833
Oh, great. Thank you. Hi.

1236
01:37:16,081 --> 01:37:17,194
Hi.

1237
01:37:18,673 --> 01:37:19,655
Hi.

1238
01:37:21,105 --> 01:37:22,796
Well, the thing is

1239
01:37:25,553 --> 01:37:27,855
you've spent
the last few days

1240
01:37:27,921 --> 01:37:30,288
getting to know
the part of me that...

1241
01:37:32,018 --> 01:37:34,254
That wasn't
really available.

1242
01:37:34,674 --> 01:37:39,377
So, I was wondering,
if I haven't screwed it up
too bad,

1243
01:37:41,426 --> 01:37:46,511
if you would be interested
in getting to know
the part of me that is.

1244
01:37:48,498 --> 01:37:49,578
Yes, she would.

1245
01:37:50,131 --> 01:37:51,178
Marty!

1246
01:37:51,347 --> 01:37:52,591
Sorry.

1247
01:38:18,036 --> 01:38:19,149
Yes.

1248
01:38:36,244 --> 01:38:38,154
Chapter 15.

1249
01:38:38,229 --> 01:38:39,538
During your travels,

1250
01:38:39,605 --> 01:38:42,671
it's important
to always keep
one thing in mind.

1251
01:38:42,741 --> 01:38:45,873
When one thing ends,
something else begins.

1252
01:39:04,726 --> 01:39:05,937
Jeez.

1253
01:39:08,342 --> 01:39:09,869
Is it yourself?

1254
01:39:11,318 --> 01:39:13,260
Yes, who else would it be?

1255
01:39:15,254 --> 01:39:17,905
Come on, climb on. Come on.

1256
01:39:19,863 --> 01:39:21,423
Hello.
Hello.

1257
01:39:22,487 --> 01:39:25,040
I won't ask you
where you've been,
not that I care.

1258
01:39:25,111 --> 01:39:26,802
Hello.
Hello.

1259
01:39:26,871 --> 01:39:29,042
Back to the salt mines, kid.

1260
01:39:29,111 --> 01:39:30,638
Hello.
Hello.

1261
01:39:33,015 --> 01:39:34,542
Hello.
Hello.

1262
01:39:35,159 --> 01:39:36,468
Goodbye.

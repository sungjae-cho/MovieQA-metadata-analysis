1
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:26,433
I wish you'd let me clean it.
- Mum, it's a rental car. Come on!

2
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,238
Thanks for a lovely Christmas.
- Bye, Mum.

3
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:33,869
Bye bye, my baby.

4
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,108
She's 22, Mum.

5
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:39,279
She's the youngest,
she'll always be my baby.

6
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,711
Take care.
- Thank you for coming up to visit.

7
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:45,078
See you, Pat.
- Bye bye.

8
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:50,840
You come back any time.
You're always welcome.

9
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:57,037
You two take care of each other.
- We will.

10
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,877
Bye, darling.
- Bye, Mum.

11
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,675
Two weeks on the road. Yes!
- Holidays.

12
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:08,194
Sure as shit
beats being in the office.

13
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,079
Where are we going to go first?
- I want to see that crocodile place.

14
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,112
Sounds good to me.

15
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,114
We almost there?

16
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,993
Yeah, pretty close.

17
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:59,036
Can I have the book?
- Yep. - Thanks.

18
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,674
"Ainsley Crocodile Adventure Park.

19
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,190
You can see the 'salties'

20
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:08,234
being fed and tour the croc farm."
- How do they farm them?

21
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:13,276
Same way you farm anything: Breed 'em,
raise 'em, kill 'em and sell 'em.

22
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:16,393
Which parts of the crocodile
do they sell?

23
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:20,756
"Crocodiles are harvested at
18 to 24 months, with 4 foot being

24
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,714
the optimum size
for the handbag market."

25
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,679
It says that in South-East Asia
the men believe

26
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:30,680
eating the penis will improve
their sex drive

27
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,999
and that you'll take on the spirit
and the aggression of the crocodile.

28
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,351
The power of the penis.

29
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,869
That's great.

30
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:45,672
Now I'll simulate a bird that's landed
on the water and is swimming across.

31
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:49,237
So this is a bird.
It's just landed on the water

32
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,639
and it's going knee-deep in the water.
Now it starts to muck around...

33
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:09,713
As you approach the water
with your billy or your fishing rod

34
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,472
a Mary River crocodile

35
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:16,878
at 12 foot... What does it
look like when I'm down there?

36
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:20,949
A dirty great, big truck
with teeth comin' at ya.

37
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:26,437
Do more than two photos, because

38
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,757
you stuff up the only photo you took

39
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,760
and you're going to be looking for me
when you get back to Sidney.

40
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,079
How's this?
- Smile!

41
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,068
"E.T."?

42
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,269
"Nine Months"?

43
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:05,357
"Alien"! - Yes.
- You're good at this. Drink?

44
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:08,349
No, I'm fine.
- You have to ask?

45
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,598
Off the booze?
- I feel fat after Christmas.

46
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:18,349
I'm just trying to lose some weight.

47
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,948
Here we go.

48
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,197
So what are we doing tomorrow. Lee?

49
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:33,271
I chose the croc place. You and Adam
choose. - There's not much on offer,

50
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,797
but I did discover this.

51
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:42,314
Here: "Backwater Barry's River Tour.
See the wildlife, catch the fish."

52
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,239
Didn't know you were into fishing.

53
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:49,674
I like being on the water. - If anyone
can catch it, it's Backwater Barry!

54
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,555
"Is that a barramundi up me bum?"

55
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:56,793
It was just an idea.
- It's okay, let's do that.

56
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,992
Yeah? It'll be fun.

57
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,469
Okay.

58
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,359
Well, this must be it.

59
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,873
Looks pretty upmarket.
- Yeah...

60
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,268
Come on through!

61
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:03,190
How can I help you?
- We're after Barry, to do the tour.

62
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:05,039
You just missed him.

63
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,356
Went about 5 minutes ago.

64
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:11,437
You want to do some fishing?
- Yeah, and see the river.

65
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,279
I can take you out.

66
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:18,196
Interested?
- Sure, yeah. - That'd be great.

67
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,516
Let's get you fitted up then, eh?
- Excellent!

68
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:38,875
What?

69
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,549
You're pregnant.

70
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:45,794
You are, aren't you?

71
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,998
I'm going to be an aunty!
- Yeah, but I haven't told him yet.

72
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:53,113
He is the father, right?
- Yeah, very funny.

73
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:58,079
I only found out last night, so
I'm just waiting for the right moment.

74
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,238
Hello, Little One!

75
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:07,232
This time of year the barra fishing is
only catch and release. - That's fine.

76
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,671
Plenty of other good fish around.

77
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:18,479
Take these. I'll meet you out there.

78
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:15,476
It's the wet season and the king tides
are running, so there's lots of water.

79
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,593
What's a king tide?
- Really high tides

80
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,235
that happen around Christmas.
- It's the best time to fish.

81
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,910
With all the extra water around
it's pretty lively on the river.

82
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,952
Is that why you brought a gun?

83
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,910
No.
That's just Barry's insurance policy

84
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,590
from the old days, before
all the crocs had moved out of here.

85
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:37,157
Now they've all either been shot
or taken to farms, so...

86
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:42,753
Who's up for a drink?
- Oh, yeah.

87
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,273
What was that?

88
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:06,073
Better have a look.

89
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,431
It's floated down from upstream.

90
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:45,074
We'll take it with us.

91
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:46,955
Let me jump back in.

92
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,554
Shall we go further up?

93
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,277
Yeah.
- Yep. Let's do it.

94
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,472
Get 'em in, eh?

95
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,879
This is excellent.

96
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,908
Even though the tide's running out,
there's still a lot of water up here.

97
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,354
It's just right.

98
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,311
Let's get a line in, eh?

99
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,713
Just out there.

100
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:47,710
Nice.

101
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,388
Something's there.

102
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,633
Take it easy.

103
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:56,955
Come on, pick it up!

104
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:03,631
What's that?
- What?

105
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,879
I don't know.

106
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,837
What happened?
- It's a fucking croc!

107
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:21,271
It's a croc. Get up the tree!
- Where's Lee?

108
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:24,598
Get up the tree, I'll get Lee
- Lee!

109
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,473
Get out of the water!

110
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,433
Just get up the tree!

111
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,832
Okay, okay!

112
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:37,715
Lee!

113
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,154
Lee, where are you?

114
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,475
Get out!

115
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,952
It's coming back!

116
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:57,152
It's the croc! Get out!

117
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,715
Get out now!

118
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,559
Please, get out!

119
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:02,593
Adam, get out!

120
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,234
Now!

121
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,438
Come on.

122
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:08,869
Come on, hurry.

123
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,871
Lee, get out of the water now!

124
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:29,869
Get out!

125
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:33,709
Get on the boat!

126
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,792
Get down. Lie down.

127
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:34,158
Over here!

128
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,595
Lee, hold on!

129
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,871
Lee, it's okay!

130
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,678
Get up the tree.

131
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:08,719
Get up the tree!

132
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,950
We've got to get her.

133
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:26,838
I think it might've gone.
- Why? - The body's gone.

134
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,554
Jim?
- Yep.

135
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,309
Before I saw it coming for you, I saw

136
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:34,513
Jim's body floating there.
- I can't see anything.

137
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,116
Trust me, it was there. Lee!

138
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:38,834
Are you okay?

139
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:44,629
We've got to get her out of there.
- We're also gonna need the boat.

140
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:49,515
I'll go over. - Are you crazy?
Maybe it's gone, maybe it hasn't!

141
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:54,476
Besides, the boat isn't safe.
- We can't just stay in the tree.

142
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:58,276
Why not? Someone will come
looking for us. - Who?

143
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:02,110
Who, Grace? No one saw us leave,
no one knows we're here.

144
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,395
The rope.

145
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:21,513
If she can get the rope to us,
we can pull her across.

146
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,798
Let's try that.
- Lee!

147
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:27,595
The rope at the front of the boat,
can you reach it?

148
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:06,037
Can you throw it to me?

149
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,436
I'll go.
- No!

150
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:17,235
Catch it, alright?
- I will.

151
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:24,392
Fuck!
- It's okay.

152
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:37,829
Can you see it?

153
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:42,275
Come on, Lee, you can do it this time.

154
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:47,675
Give yourself a bit of slack.

155
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,877
I'm here, darling.

156
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,594
Big throw.

157
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,990
Fuck.
- It's okay. Don't move. I'll get it.

158
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:00,511
Get us a branch. Just above you.

159
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:04,834
Here, got it?

160
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:37,869
Fuck.

161
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:39,958
I'm not going into the water again.

162
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,434
Wrap it around your hand.

163
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,639
Okay, one, two, three!

164
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:51,678
Must be stuck on a log.

165
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:00,349
It's alright.

166
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:10,318
I've tied off the rope, okay?

167
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:13,752
Get into the water slowly and use
the rope to guide yourself over, okay?

168
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,998
You can do it, okay?

169
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,233
Come on.

170
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:41,953
Better get up.

171
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,711
That's it!

172
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,512
Keep coming.

173
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:51,357
I've got you. That's it!

174
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,711
Right, come on.
- You've got her?

175
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:56,116
Yeah, I've got her. Okay there.

176
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:59,199
You're okay, baby, you're okay.

177
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,517
Grab the rope.

178
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:09,472
You got it?
- Oh, fuck. That was amazing.

179
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:12,192
Bloody amazing.

180
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,958
Shit...
- Your ankle, is it okay?

181
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:20,238
It's pretty sore.
- Oh my God,

182
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:22,398
it doesn't look good.

183
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:27,679
Where's Jim?

184
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:32,876
He got taken.
- What?

185
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:38,949
How did this happen?
We were in a metal boat!

186
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:43,038
Is it still here?

187
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,593
Can't see it.

188
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:10,477
So how are we gonna get out of here?
What are we gonna do?

189
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:15,674
Wait for someone to come for us.
- Who's going to come for us?

190
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:18,554
I don't know, but isn't that
what they say you should do?

191
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,195
But no one knows we're here.

192
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,959
There's hundreds of miles of estuary
and mangroves along the river...

193
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,960
No one's coming.
- I still think we should just wait.

194
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,311
When did we last see another boat?

195
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:37,193
We did see the petrol drum. That
could've been in the water for months.

196
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:39,756
So what's your idea?

197
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:46,549
The boat.

198
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,109
The boat?

199
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,276
Did you miss something, Adam?

200
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:57,111
It just flipped over. You think we're
safe in that? It's our best shot.

201
00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:01,599
Okay. So how do you figure
we get to it, flip it,

202
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:04,874
bail it and get out of here without
being eaten? - Better than waiting

203
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:08,471
to be rescued by people
who don't know we're missing. - Help!

204
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:43,034
We'll die of malaria waiting out here.

205
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,674
I've still got the Rid.

206
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:04,396
You beauty!
- Come on!

207
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,831
It's dead.
- Fuck.

208
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:26,312
What have I got?

209
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,748
Car keys.

210
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:31,755
Penknife.

211
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:33,994
My wallet.

212
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:39,279
One more stamp
and I get a free coffee.

213
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:46,439
What was that?

214
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,758
I want to get out of here.

215
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:40,359
Maybe we can use these trees
to get out of here.

216
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,672
Look, guys,

217
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:49,112
even if we could get to land,
we're miles from anywhere.

218
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:53,758
The idea of getting lost here...
- "Getting lost"? We're already lost!

219
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:56,668
We go along this river
and get back to here we came from.

220
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,759
Really? Do you know where we are?
- We're on the river.

221
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:03,590
Do you remember every turn we took?
- I don't need to. - Whatever!

222
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:06,679
I think Grace is right.
I think we should try the trees.

223
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:13,036
Do you think it's gonna be easy
getting around in these trees?

224
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:14,794
Look at it!

225
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:54,311
I'll go check out the trees.
- It's alright, I'll go.

226
00:30:56,320 --> 00:31:00,393
You've lost your glasses. You can't
put any weight on that leg. I'll go.

227
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:03,274
It's okay, I'm fine. - Adam, you're
half blind without your glasses.

228
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:05,551
I'm not blind. I can see, alright?

229
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:08,636
Just shove over.

230
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:11,992
This is crazy! - And going for
the boat isn't? - You can't go.

231
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:16,311
Why not?
- You just can't. I'm fine, I'll go.

232
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:18,398
Lee, you're not fine.

233
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:20,910
I'm going to stick to the trees.

234
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:24,432
If they run out,
I'm straight back here.

235
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,429
Okay?

236
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:41,512
Just be careful, alright?
- I will.

237
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:15,755
Adam!

238
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:17,949
Grace?

239
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:27,317
You alright?
- Here, Grace! - We're just here.

240
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:29,109
You're okay...

241
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:31,793
It's okay. I got you.

242
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:33,116
I got you.

243
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:35,508
Come on.

244
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:39,435
You alright?
- Yep.

245
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:44,158
What's wrong? What happened?
- Nothing, nothing.

246
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:48,028
I just got a little bit spooked,
that's all.

247
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,070
I'm okay.

248
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:01,835
Okay...

249
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:06,872
So... We're surrounded by water.

250
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:12,153
It's a bit of a swim to land,
but it's doable. - How far?

251
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:15,353
I don't know, like, 50 or 100 metres?

252
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,797
The boat's only just there.

253
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:21,515
But we can't get to it.
- We haven't tried yet.

254
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:32,309
So...

255
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:35,672
What's it to be?

256
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:40,758
The boat... or a 300-metre swim
in a croc-infested river?

257
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:43,509
It's not 300 metres.

258
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:46,679
I'm with Grace. I say if we wait
someone will come along.

259
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:05,632
What's that song that kids sing?

260
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:08,035
"The three ..."

261
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:13,112
"Three cheeky monkeys
sitting in a tree,

262
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:15,875
teasing Mr Crocodile,

263
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:18,431
'Can't catch me! '

264
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:21,271
Along comes Mr Crocodile,

265
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:24,351
quiet as can be...

266
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:28,954
Snap!"

267
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:33,719
Thank you, Adam.

268
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:41,799
I prefer "Row, Row, Row Your Boat,
Gently Down The Stream." - So do I!

269
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:44,674
Let's get the boat
and get out of here.

270
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:52,279
Okay, we'll try it your way.

271
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:55,633
For now.

272
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:48,708
I thought I was falling.

273
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,956
Can I please have the Rid?

274
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:08,509
Thanks.

275
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:11,717
Shit. Sorry.

276
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:33,755
It's time to get moving.

277
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:39,872
The longer we wait,
the harder it'll be to get going.

278
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:45,315
Look, we've waited,

279
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:50,993
we've waited hours
to see this fucker, and no show.

280
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:57,119
I hate to say it, but he'll probably
be chowing down on Jim for a while.

281
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:07,750
I remember, when I was a kid

282
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:13,839
I spent a day in a cupboard, thinking
my brother was gonna beat me up.

283
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:19,316
Thing is, after he chased me into the
cupboard, he went off with his mates.

284
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:25,036
It wasn't my brother keeping me in
the cupboard. It was me. It was fear.

285
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:32,279
If there's no croc down there,
what the hell are we doing up here?

286
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:36,349
Okay.

287
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:41,276
You've made your point.

288
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,274
So what's your plan?

289
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:45,909
Look...

290
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:49,557
I get over to the boat,
I ride it, I bring it over here

291
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,675
and we get out.
- That's your plan? - That's my plan.

292
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:02,272
I could go with you.

293
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:05,359
No. Look, it's best
to just risk one of us.

294
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:09,315
I'm the strongest, I have the best
chance of getting to the boat.

295
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:11,109
No, don't go.

296
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:13,790
Grace, we're not gonna be rescued.

297
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:24,719
Please. Just wait a little longer.
- It's okay, I'll be right back.

298
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:30,236
Adam...
- What?

299
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:32,159
What is it?

300
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:38,074
Gracie, it's okay.

301
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:39,470
Take care.

302
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:41,911
I'll be right back.

303
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:49,389
Give us a bit of slack.

304
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:52,190
Just need to loosen the rope.

305
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:40,239
No, no...

306
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,433
No, no!
- Adam!

307
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:45,393
Come up!

308
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:10,959
Adam, come up!

309
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:14,392
Come up!

310
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:22,392
Please, let him go!

311
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:24,639
Go on, you let him go.

312
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:26,479
Let him go!

313
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:47,509
It's not going
to leave us alone, is it?

314
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:54,996
We're gonna die, aren't we?

315
00:47:56,080 --> 00:47:57,069
Lee...

316
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:02,198
Fuck!
- Stop it.

317
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:08,633
We're going to get out of here.
- Yeah? And how are we gonna do that?

318
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:10,589
The boat.

319
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:13,356
The boat? The boat?

320
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:17,271
That's so fucking hilarious.

321
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:19,711
You have no idea, do you?
- Shut up, Lee!

322
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:24,149
Shut up! I need you
to get over there and keep watch.

323
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:27,114
Get over there and keep a look out.

324
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,149
Get up!

325
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:33,035
Get up.

326
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:45,509
Hold that.

327
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:51,438
Give it to me.

328
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:51,233
It's coming!

329
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:53,878
Where?
- Quick! - I'm coming.

330
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:04,236
Are you sure you saw it?
- Yeah, I thought I saw it.

331
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:22,309
I'm going back down.

332
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:27,076
I'll get a bigger stick,
go back down and get the rope.

333
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:31,909
Okay.

334
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:29,839
Can you see it?

335
00:51:30,280 --> 00:51:31,269
No.

336
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:54,317
The boat's going out.

337
00:51:57,480 --> 00:52:00,278
He's just there.
- I know.

338
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:03,276
Maybe it won't go far.

339
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:06,029
It's half full of water now.

340
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:39,271
I didn't tell him, Lee.

341
00:52:41,560 --> 00:52:45,473
I was going to, but I didn't.
- I know. I'm so sorry.

342
00:52:47,560 --> 00:52:51,075
We didn't say goodbye.
Maybe we should say goodbye.

343
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:02,193
Goodbye.

344
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:04,548
Goodbye...

345
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:16,428
I don't know what to say.
- I know...

346
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:21,997
Goodbye, baby.

347
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:16,148
I'm so thirsty.

348
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:18,718
I just wish it would rain.

349
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:23,151
I can't see the boat.

350
00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:32,959
I was thinking...

351
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:37,632
Remember when we were kids and we used
to have holidays at the beach house,

352
00:54:39,080 --> 00:54:42,152
and you could always smell
when a storm was coming?

353
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:44,556
It smells like that.
- Yeah...

354
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:46,274
It does.

355
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:51,715
Remember those brothers?

356
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:54,799
The brothers
who were there every year.

357
00:54:55,480 --> 00:54:58,870
Paul...
- Yeah, Mick and Paul Davies.

358
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:07,275
Those boys were always chasing you.
- And you were always saving me.

359
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:14,995
What was that?

360
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:21,038
What was that?

361
00:55:23,120 --> 00:55:26,192
Oh God, it's eating him!

362
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:32,599
No, no...

363
00:56:29,240 --> 00:56:30,275
Grace.

364
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:34,755
Hey, Gracie.

365
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:40,553
Are you okay?

366
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:47,270
Grace, you're scaring me. You okay?

367
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:56,634
Hey, listen...

368
00:56:58,560 --> 00:57:00,630
I'm so sorry about what happened.

369
00:57:01,080 --> 00:57:03,275
I really am so sorry.

370
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,275
But we have to help ourselves.

371
00:57:15,560 --> 00:57:18,870
"Two cheeky monkeys,
sitting in a tree,

372
00:57:20,080 --> 00:57:23,834
teasing Mr Crocodile,
'Can't catch me! '

373
00:57:24,920 --> 00:57:28,754
Along came Mr Crocodile,
quiet as can be...

374
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:32,192
Snap, snap ..."

375
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:38,957
Thank you.
Thanks, that's being very helpful.

376
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:47,434
I'm sorry.

377
00:57:59,560 --> 00:58:01,471
The boat's back.

378
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:04,072
At the wrong tree.

379
00:58:05,960 --> 00:58:08,315
God, we have to do something.

380
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:11,271
I'm not going back to the boat.

381
00:58:12,120 --> 00:58:13,553
Not after...

382
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:17,156
I'm just so tired!

383
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:20,678
I'm so thirsty.

384
00:58:21,120 --> 00:58:22,599
Me, too.

385
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:37,396
What are we going to do, Gracie?

386
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:43,835
Well...

387
00:58:46,080 --> 00:58:51,154
If a boat's gonna go past,
it's gonna go past up there.

388
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:54,598
Up where we came in.

389
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:57,237
I don't know, maybe...

390
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:02,512
Maybe we should see
if we can try and get to it.

391
00:59:03,360 --> 00:59:05,430
Using the trees?
- Yeah.

392
00:59:07,080 --> 00:59:11,198
I could go check it out.
- Please can we go together?

393
00:59:20,320 --> 00:59:21,435
Hang on, wait.

394
00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:27,077
Let's do something to try
and keep it away. - Okay.

395
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:30,792
"Go away, Croc.

396
00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:33,468
Go away.

397
00:59:34,800 --> 00:59:37,837
You're gonna go away. Far, far away.

398
00:59:38,840 --> 00:59:40,478
Lee and Grace will be safe.

399
00:59:41,320 --> 00:59:43,038
Lee and Grace will be safe.

400
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:46,435
Lee and Grace will be safe."

401
01:01:00,440 --> 01:01:01,919
You alright?
- Yep.

402
01:01:20,800 --> 01:01:22,392
Let's go for that one.

403
01:01:23,720 --> 01:01:25,199
Okay?
- Yeah...

404
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:35,115
Are we really gonna do this?
- Don't know. Didn't we just say so?

405
01:01:35,560 --> 01:01:37,869
Yep, yep.

406
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:41,078
It's gonna be okay.

407
01:02:34,680 --> 01:02:36,193
I think...
- What?

408
01:02:37,080 --> 01:02:40,277
I think we should go back.
- Don't. We're almost halfway there.

409
01:02:41,840 --> 01:02:42,955
Okay then.

410
01:02:59,200 --> 01:03:01,316
What do we do?
- Just stay tight.

411
01:03:01,760 --> 01:03:03,716
Just keep tight.

412
01:03:05,720 --> 01:03:08,871
Fuck off, you fuck!

413
01:03:23,160 --> 01:03:23,910
Grace!

414
01:03:38,200 --> 01:03:39,189
Grace!

415
01:04:01,360 --> 01:04:02,759
Get up there!

416
01:04:10,280 --> 01:04:13,431
You're alright. You're alright!

417
01:04:21,560 --> 01:04:23,073
You're okay.

418
01:04:26,520 --> 01:04:28,715
It's really not that deep.

419
01:04:35,120 --> 01:04:38,510
You have to stay with me, alright?
Just have to fix your leg.

420
01:04:39,240 --> 01:04:40,992
So keep breathing, okay?

421
01:04:49,560 --> 01:04:52,711
Hold in there!
- Fuck, it really hurts!

422
01:05:01,640 --> 01:05:03,392
You're okay.

423
01:05:22,520 --> 01:05:23,509
It's a boat.

424
01:05:24,040 --> 01:05:27,237
It's a boat! You'll be alright.

425
01:05:30,920 --> 01:05:33,195
Wait! We're here!

426
01:05:33,640 --> 01:05:34,629
Wait!

427
01:05:40,080 --> 01:05:41,274
We're here!

428
01:05:41,720 --> 01:05:42,789
Help!

429
01:05:45,600 --> 01:05:46,635
We're here!

430
01:05:47,840 --> 01:05:49,239
Wait!

431
01:05:50,720 --> 01:05:52,039
No, come back!

432
01:05:52,480 --> 01:05:53,595
Come back!

433
01:05:54,440 --> 01:05:57,830
We're here!

434
01:06:04,440 --> 01:06:05,395
Fuck!

435
01:06:25,320 --> 01:06:28,471
I hate you,
you fucking shitty piece of tin!

436
01:06:29,080 --> 01:06:30,354
Fucking hate you!

437
01:06:30,800 --> 01:06:32,791
This is all your fault.

438
01:06:34,640 --> 01:06:36,312
This is all your fault!

439
01:06:52,760 --> 01:06:54,079
Grace, get your legs up!

440
01:06:54,520 --> 01:06:55,430
Get your legs up!

441
01:06:55,880 --> 01:06:57,632
You get away from her!

442
01:06:58,520 --> 01:06:59,509
Get away!

443
01:07:00,800 --> 01:07:02,153
Tuck your legs in!

444
01:07:04,360 --> 01:07:05,713
I'm right here, Gracie.

445
01:07:10,440 --> 01:07:12,396
I need you to get your legs up.

446
01:07:14,280 --> 01:07:15,918
You gotta tuck in.

447
01:07:23,040 --> 01:07:25,076
Are you okay?

448
01:07:27,640 --> 01:07:29,915
Just have to change this, okay?

449
01:07:35,080 --> 01:07:36,308
There was a boat.

450
01:07:48,720 --> 01:07:50,312
Okay? You okay?

451
01:08:05,960 --> 01:08:07,154
Just gonna get the boat, okay?

452
01:08:07,800 --> 01:08:10,189
Lee.
- Be back in a minute. - Don't go.

453
01:08:10,640 --> 01:08:13,791
I'll be right back.
- That's what Adam said. - It's okay.

454
01:08:14,240 --> 01:08:15,912
It's not. Please.

455
01:08:16,720 --> 01:08:18,119
It's okay. I love you.

456
01:08:19,120 --> 01:08:22,271
I love you so much.
- Don't leave me, please!

457
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:24,911
Lee, please don't go.

458
01:08:49,280 --> 01:08:52,113
Please, help us. Please, keep us safe.

459
01:10:12,320 --> 01:10:13,469
I've got the boat, Grace!

460
01:13:37,560 --> 01:13:38,709
Coming, Gracie.

461
01:13:39,160 --> 01:13:40,309
Coming, Gracie.

462
01:14:19,840 --> 01:14:20,875
Fuck!

463
01:15:04,200 --> 01:15:06,509
Coming, Gracie. Coming, Gracie.

464
01:15:17,040 --> 01:15:19,031
Quick, quick.

465
01:15:54,880 --> 01:15:55,869
Sorry.

466
01:15:56,360 --> 01:15:57,429
I'm sorry.

467
01:16:07,560 --> 01:16:09,118
Come on.

468
01:16:16,320 --> 01:16:17,435
Come on!

469
01:16:24,560 --> 01:16:26,039
Come on!

470
01:16:31,960 --> 01:16:33,154
Come on!

471
01:16:36,480 --> 01:16:37,959
Come on!

472
01:19:25,960 --> 01:19:27,632
Coming, Gracie.

473
01:19:30,360 --> 01:19:33,033
Coming, Gracie. Coming.

474
01:19:39,440 --> 01:19:40,953
I did it!

475
01:20:21,560 --> 01:20:23,198
Grace, we can go.

476
01:20:23,640 --> 01:20:27,474
We can go home now.
Grace, I did it! Gracie?

477
01:21:15,040 --> 01:21:16,109
No...

478
01:21:18,360 --> 01:21:19,509
No, Grace!

But being learned in the magical arts...

01:50:58,165 --> 01:51:03,335
...the three brothers simply
waved their wands and made a bridge.

1180
01:51:04,671 --> 01:51:06,756
Before they could cross, however...

1181
01:51:06,923 --> 01:51:11,052
...they found their path blocked
by a hooded figure.

It was Death, and he felt cheated.

1183
01:51:15,348 --> 01:51:18,392
Cheated because travelers would
normally drown in the river.

1184
01:51:18,560 --> 01:51:20,644
But Death was cunning.

1185
01:51:21,271 --> 01:51:24,273
He pretended to congratulate
the three brothers on their magic...

1186
01:51:24,441 --> 01:51:29,737
...and said that each had earned a prize for
having been clever enough to evade him.

1187
01:51:30,280 --> 01:51:34,867
The oldest asked for a wand
more powerful than any in existence.

1188
01:51:35,035 --> 01:51:39,622
So Death fashioned him one
from an elder tree that stood nearby.

1189
01:51:41,041 --> 01:51:45,336
The second brother decided he wanted
to humiliate Death even further...

1190
01:51:45,504 --> 01:51:49,924
...and asked for the power
to recall loved ones from the grave.

1191
01:51:50,383 --> 01:51:54,678
So Death plucked a stone from the river
and offered it to him.

1192
01:51:55,430 --> 01:51:59,391
Finally,
Death turned to the third brother.

1193
01:52:00,602 --> 01:52:02,019
A humble man...

1194
01:52:02,187 --> 01:52:06,398
...he asked for something that would
allow him to go forth from that place...

1195
01:52:06,566 --> 01:52:09,735
...without being followed by Death.

1196
01:52:10,821 --> 01:52:16,700
And so it was that Death reluctantly
handed over his own Cloak of Invisibility.

1197
01:52:20,080 --> 01:52:22,998
The first brother traveled
to a distant village...

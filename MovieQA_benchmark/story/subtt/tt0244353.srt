1
00:00:31,487 --> 00:00:35,188
No one knows the real story of
the great King Arthur of Camelot.

2
00:00:36,409 --> 00:00:38,947
Most of what you think
you know about Camelot...

3
00:00:39,412 --> 00:00:41,286
..Guinevere and Lancelot...

4
00:00:41,747 --> 00:00:44,998
..and the evil sorceress
known as Morgaine Le Fey...

5
00:00:45,084 --> 00:00:46,744
..is nothing but lies.

6
00:00:53,551 --> 00:00:56,552
I should know,
for I am Morgaine Le Fey...

7
00:00:57,221 --> 00:00:59,297
..priestess of the Isle of Avalon...

8
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:02,806
..where the ancient religion
of the Mother Goddess was born.

9
00:01:14,113 --> 00:01:16,783
It began in the midst of
the most violent upheaval...

10
00:01:16,866 --> 00:01:18,609
..Britain has ever seen.

11
00:01:19,077 --> 00:01:22,113
The Saxon barbarians
swept into my country...

12
00:01:22,205 --> 00:01:25,490
..killing Christians and followers
of Avalon's goddess alike.

13
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:03,912
Unless one great leader
could unite Christians...

14
00:02:03,997 --> 00:02:06,073
..and followers of the old religion...

15
00:02:06,708 --> 00:02:08,831
..Britain was doomed to barbarism...

16
00:02:09,252 --> 00:02:11,244
..and Avalon would vanish.

17
00:02:13,464 --> 00:02:15,587
My Christian father, Gorlois...

18
00:02:15,675 --> 00:02:18,545
..battled tirelessly
against the Saxon hordes.

19
00:02:18,636 --> 00:02:21,471
For Christ!
For Britain!

20
00:02:26,269 --> 00:02:30,349
Back home in Cornwall,
I was only a child at the time...

21
00:02:32,525 --> 00:02:36,475
..but I knew my mother, Igraine, was
still a follower of the old religion...

22
00:02:36,571 --> 00:02:38,860
..and secretly practiced
its ancient magic.

23
00:02:40,867 --> 00:02:43,025
Her sister,
my Aunt Morgause...

24
00:02:43,369 --> 00:02:46,489
..had lived with us for
as long as I can remember.

25
00:02:46,915 --> 00:02:49,073
She relished the power of Avalon.

26
00:02:51,377 --> 00:02:52,291
Mother?

27
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,872
Mother, what's the matter?

28
00:03:01,179 --> 00:03:03,337
Let her have her vision, lamb.

29
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:06,049
I want to know what
the Sight brings her.

30
00:03:06,142 --> 00:03:07,091
She's afraid.

31
00:03:07,185 --> 00:03:08,644
Let her have her vision.

32
00:03:08,728 --> 00:03:10,886
Father will be angry
if she uses the Sight.

33
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:13,222
Then he won't hear about it,
will he?

34
00:03:14,609 --> 00:03:15,605
What is it?

35
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:17,058
Igraine...

36
00:03:17,529 --> 00:03:18,904
..what do you see?

37
00:03:20,031 --> 00:03:21,490
Anything for me?

38
00:03:21,741 --> 00:03:24,314
A lover?
A husband?

39
00:03:29,541 --> 00:03:31,747
The Lady of the Lake is coming...

40
00:03:32,043 --> 00:03:34,285
..and the Merlin of Britain with her.

41
00:03:35,129 --> 00:03:36,410
We must make ready.

42
00:03:37,257 --> 00:03:38,419
What do they want?

43
00:03:39,133 --> 00:03:41,921
You can ask them yourself.
They're here.

44
00:03:55,608 --> 00:03:57,601
And so Viviane came to Cornwall.

45
00:03:58,153 --> 00:04:00,275
The eldest of the three sisters...

46
00:04:00,446 --> 00:04:02,772
..Viviane was the High
Priestess of Avalon...

47
00:04:03,241 --> 00:04:06,158
..and the voice of the
Mother Goddess on earth.

48
00:04:06,369 --> 00:04:08,492
She had just one goal...

49
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:10,703
..to save Avalon from the Saxons.

50
00:04:11,875 --> 00:04:15,078
Sister, we have to bring
this fighting to an end.

51
00:04:15,295 --> 00:04:17,583
The Saxons will destroy this land.

52
00:04:17,714 --> 00:04:19,208
Unless we prevent it.

53
00:04:19,883 --> 00:04:20,629
How?

54
00:04:20,925 --> 00:04:24,211
By giving this land a leader to
whom both followers of Christ...

55
00:04:24,304 --> 00:04:26,343
..and the Goddess can give allegiance.

56
00:04:26,514 --> 00:04:29,088
Someone with the blood
of Avalon in his veins.

57
00:04:29,601 --> 00:04:31,807
The High King could
still father a child.

58
00:04:31,895 --> 00:04:33,971
But he'll be dead within six months.

59
00:04:34,063 --> 00:04:35,855
Viviane has foreseen it.

60
00:04:35,982 --> 00:04:37,891
He'll die without leaving an heir.

61
00:04:38,818 --> 00:04:41,689
You mean my husband will
become High King in his place?

62
00:04:41,988 --> 00:04:44,313
That I will bear this
leader that you speak of?

63
00:04:45,617 --> 00:04:48,322
You will bear the king, Igraine. Yes.

64
00:04:49,162 --> 00:04:50,905
But not to Gorlois.

65
00:04:52,499 --> 00:04:55,998
You will bear the child to
the man who wears this sign.

66
00:05:01,591 --> 00:05:05,589
He is a follower of the Goddess,
and he will be king.

67
00:05:06,429 --> 00:05:09,845
I'm married to the Duke of Cornwall.
I've borne him a child.

68
00:05:10,183 --> 00:05:12,591
I will not betray him.
I gave him my vows.

69
00:05:12,686 --> 00:05:14,844
You gave them first to Avalon.

70
00:05:15,522 --> 00:05:18,226
If you want this child
to be born of Avalon...

71
00:05:18,316 --> 00:05:21,353
..then you can bear this
great new king yourself.

72
00:05:21,861 --> 00:05:24,068
There is no need, Viviane.

73
00:05:25,573 --> 00:05:27,281
Let me bear the child.

74
00:05:27,575 --> 00:05:29,283
I have no husband to betray.

75
00:05:29,369 --> 00:05:30,947
Let me bear the king.

76
00:05:31,121 --> 00:05:32,864
Have you no shame, Morgause?

77
00:05:33,206 --> 00:05:34,036
Leave us.

78
00:05:34,666 --> 00:05:37,667
I have as much Avalon
in my veins as she does!

79
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:40,828
Let me make this man
fall in love with me.

80
00:05:41,548 --> 00:05:43,006
I know the arts as well.

81
00:05:43,216 --> 00:05:46,087
No man or woman can live
another's fate, Morgause.

82
00:05:46,553 --> 00:05:48,878
You have a king in your future,
and sons.

83
00:05:48,972 --> 00:05:49,718
Who?

84
00:05:49,806 --> 00:05:51,431
You'll know when you see him.

85
00:05:52,642 --> 00:05:54,018
Be content with that.

86
00:05:55,186 --> 00:05:56,811
You must remember, Duchess...

87
00:05:56,896 --> 00:05:59,304
..that Viviane is not just your sister.

88
00:05:59,399 --> 00:06:01,522
She is the High
Priestess of the faith...

89
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:04,610
..to which you have
promised your very breath.

90
00:06:04,904 --> 00:06:06,731
The violence can end.

91
00:06:07,324 --> 00:06:09,032
The choice is yours.

92
00:06:09,492 --> 00:06:10,441
But my word...

93
00:06:10,535 --> 00:06:14,070
Sometimes we have to sacrifice
small virtues to achieve great ones.

94
00:06:14,247 --> 00:06:17,581
This year's harvest is tilled
with the blood of your own men.

95
00:06:25,216 --> 00:06:26,415
Morgaine!

96
00:06:26,801 --> 00:06:27,999
What happened?

97
00:06:28,094 --> 00:06:29,257
What is it, child?

98
00:06:29,679 --> 00:06:30,960
A dead man.

99
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,845
Tell me, child.

100
00:06:35,268 --> 00:06:37,676
Do you often see things others don't?

101
00:06:37,896 --> 00:06:40,766
Yes.
All the time.

102
00:06:44,819 --> 00:06:46,314
She has the Sight already.

103
00:06:49,866 --> 00:06:51,064
Three months later...

104
00:06:51,159 --> 00:06:53,615
..the High King summoned
all the great chiefs...

105
00:06:53,703 --> 00:06:55,945
..to London to name his successor.

106
00:06:56,373 --> 00:06:59,290
And he invited my mother
as an honored guest.

107
00:06:59,501 --> 00:07:02,371
But the Saxons will never
forget the blows you dealt them.

108
00:07:02,462 --> 00:07:05,629
You and I, Gorlois.
We dealt them together.

109
00:07:06,174 --> 00:07:08,926
But I think I shall be
fighting no more Saxons.

110
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:11,548
Of course you will.
It'll be many years...

111
00:07:11,638 --> 00:07:13,844
That is why I have called this council.

112
00:07:14,307 --> 00:07:15,849
It's why you're here.

113
00:07:16,768 --> 00:07:18,476
I must tell you, Igraine...

114
00:07:19,521 --> 00:07:22,688
..my priests don't like it that
your priestess of Avalon...

115
00:07:22,774 --> 00:07:25,775
..has been placed on an
equal footing with them.

116
00:07:26,778 --> 00:07:30,562
But I say that you both serve
the Great One above us...

117
00:07:30,866 --> 00:07:32,657
..by whatever the name.

118
00:07:33,743 --> 00:07:35,736
And women are,
after all...

119
00:07:35,996 --> 00:07:38,154
..the carriers of original sin.

120
00:07:39,875 --> 00:07:42,282
That's not quite how we advance it, sir.

121
00:07:43,003 --> 00:07:44,082
Do you not say...

122
00:07:44,171 --> 00:07:47,871
..that women are the means by
which evil came into the world?

123
00:07:48,258 --> 00:07:52,172
There is, in your Bible, a fantastic
tale about an apple and a snake.

124
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:56,346
The Bible merely recounts the truth,
good lady.

125
00:07:56,975 --> 00:07:59,513
The old religion
embraces yours, Bishop...

126
00:07:59,978 --> 00:08:02,765
..but your priests deny
the power of Avalon.

127
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:05,229
Perhaps people no longer believe in it.

128
00:08:06,193 --> 00:08:08,399
Perhaps it's because
you tell them not to.

129
00:08:09,362 --> 00:08:12,731
- Igraine!
- Your wife speaks her mind, Gorlois.

130
00:08:14,201 --> 00:08:15,861
I honour her for that.

131
00:08:26,379 --> 00:08:29,084
Back, you hounds from hell!
Back!

132
00:08:36,223 --> 00:08:37,468
My lord,
forgive me.

133
00:08:37,557 --> 00:08:40,642
You are forgiven,
but get those dogs out of here!

134
00:08:40,727 --> 00:08:43,099
Can't you go anywhere without them?

135
00:08:55,659 --> 00:08:58,280
Allow me to introduce you,
Uther Pendragon...

136
00:08:58,370 --> 00:08:59,650
..to my wife...

137
00:08:59,871 --> 00:09:02,197
..the Lady Igraine,
Duchess of Cornwall.

138
00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:04,616
And sister to the Lady of Avalon.

139
00:09:05,919 --> 00:09:08,624
It's an honour to meet a
daughter of the Holy Isle.

140
00:09:19,099 --> 00:09:20,510
You will bear the child...

141
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:23,552
..to the man who wears this sign.

142
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:32,768
Excuse me,
my lord.

143
00:09:56,345 --> 00:09:58,468
Viviane.

144
00:09:58,889 --> 00:10:01,462
Why are you doing this to me?

145
00:10:02,059 --> 00:10:03,683
Now, listen to me.

146
00:10:04,311 --> 00:10:09,056
What I am about to say will be
of great importance to you all.

147
00:10:33,549 --> 00:10:36,086
Did I do something to disturb you, lady?

148
00:10:37,469 --> 00:10:38,798
I felt unwell, sir.

149
00:10:41,139 --> 00:10:43,927
You left the moment you
saw the dragon on my wrist.

150
00:10:45,894 --> 00:10:47,472
I have no fear of dragons.

151
00:10:47,896 --> 00:10:50,352
I'm a child of the
old world myself, sir.

152
00:10:52,442 --> 00:10:55,230
Why do you call me "sir"
in such a manner...

153
00:10:58,198 --> 00:11:00,570
..when you know that we
are on familiar terms?

154
00:11:02,202 --> 00:11:03,613
We have not met before.

155
00:11:04,121 --> 00:11:05,580
Not in this life...

156
00:11:06,373 --> 00:11:08,579
..but like all of us of the old ways...

157
00:11:09,293 --> 00:11:12,827
..you must believe this is not the
only life where we could have met.

158
00:11:16,466 --> 00:11:18,792
There is something
between our souls already.

159
00:11:20,387 --> 00:11:22,261
You felt the power of it...

160
00:11:22,347 --> 00:11:24,221
..and that's why you left the hall.

161
00:11:28,103 --> 00:11:29,218
Am I right, lady?

162
00:11:30,272 --> 00:11:32,845
If I am,
could you rightfully resist it?

163
00:11:34,401 --> 00:11:38,814
I am the sworn wife of Gorlois,
and so I will remain.

164
00:11:40,073 --> 00:11:41,616
So you know what I felt.

165
00:11:45,245 --> 00:11:46,408
Come away with me.

166
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:49,030
Please, get back to the council.

167
00:11:49,833 --> 00:11:52,289
There's nothing to do but give in to it.

168
00:11:54,713 --> 00:11:59,090
If you do not come with me,
then I will come for you...

169
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:02,127
..before the moon is full again.

170
00:12:10,979 --> 00:12:12,260
My lord...

171
00:12:12,981 --> 00:12:14,891
..is the council finished?

172
00:12:14,983 --> 00:12:16,182
It is.

173
00:12:17,569 --> 00:12:20,274
Let's get back to the proceedings then,
shall we?

174
00:12:21,281 --> 00:12:24,366
Don't you want to ask the leave
of your new High King, lady?

175
00:12:25,369 --> 00:12:27,112
- You?
- No.

176
00:12:28,956 --> 00:12:31,957
Ambrosius has named Uther
Pendragon his successor.

177
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:42,292
Don't envy me, Gorlois.

178
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:44,881
The lady belongs to you.

179
00:12:53,981 --> 00:12:55,938
You should take care to avoid gossip.

180
00:12:57,609 --> 00:12:59,982
No chaste woman is safe
with Uther Pendragon.

181
00:13:01,363 --> 00:13:04,566
People may gossip if they like.
It doesn't concern me.

182
00:13:04,742 --> 00:13:06,117
It concerns me!

183
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:08,826
Are you questioning my honour?

184
00:13:08,912 --> 00:13:10,905
I'm questioning your judgment.

185
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:13,952
Well, if your judgment
is no better than that...

186
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:16,498
..then your word will cease
to concern me as well.

187
00:13:16,587 --> 00:13:19,754
How dare you play the shrew with me!
I told you to avoid him!

188
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,334
- I'll teach you!
- Think...

189
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:24,040
..before you strike me, Gorlois...

190
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:29,297
..or I will teach you that a daughter of
the Holy Isle is the servant of no man.

191
00:13:32,561 --> 00:13:35,847
And so, my father was caught
up in Viviane's plots.

192
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:56,079
Sire!

193
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:59,457
A messenger for the High King.
He waits at the gate.

194
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,707
He will speak with...

195
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:06,464
I have come,
my lord...

196
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:09,045
To ask for my troops
to aide the Pendragon.

197
00:14:09,306 --> 00:14:10,884
It is the High King's bidding.

198
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:13,514
I need my men here in Cornwall.

199
00:14:13,727 --> 00:14:15,720
The Saxons are massing off our coast.

200
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:18,636
The king believes it's
just a feint, Gorlois.

201
00:14:18,732 --> 00:14:21,817
He's ordered all his war dukes
to assemble on the south coast.

202
00:14:21,902 --> 00:14:24,689
Uther Pendragon can't know
the mind of the Saxons.

203
00:14:26,073 --> 00:14:28,564
- I must keep the safety of my land.
- Sir.

204
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:32,284
This is not a request.
It's an order from your king.

205
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:35,243
He's asked you to bring your
army to him straight away.

206
00:14:35,332 --> 00:14:37,491
I am the Duke of Cornwall, Captain.

207
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:39,127
Uther Pendragon is not.

208
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:41,785
But as his Duke,
you've sworn your army to him.

209
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:44,420
Are you going to betray
him at the first test?

210
00:14:44,508 --> 00:14:46,916
Watch what you say, Captain.

211
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:50,552
When I've seen off this Saxon threat,
then I'll consider...

212
00:14:50,931 --> 00:14:54,300
..whether I'll be able to help
the Pendragon in his schemes.

213
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:56,599
If you refuse the High King now...

214
00:14:57,354 --> 00:14:58,979
..he will become your enemy.

215
00:15:01,108 --> 00:15:04,026
If Uther Pendragon thinks
he can fight the Saxons...

216
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:06,445
..and then fight me after...

217
00:15:06,864 --> 00:15:08,027
..let him try!

218
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:13,703
I was too young then...

219
00:15:13,954 --> 00:15:17,822
..to understand why my father
hated the High King so much.

220
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:22,086
But the moment he rode out to hold
the Saxons at bay at Cameldun...

221
00:15:22,671 --> 00:15:25,079
..the magic of Avalon began to work.

222
00:15:28,803 --> 00:15:29,917
Sister?

223
00:15:30,513 --> 00:15:32,007
Sister, hear me.

224
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:44,640
Viviane!

225
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:46,149
Igraine...

226
00:15:47,154 --> 00:15:50,321
..you must listen if you want
to see Uther alive again.

227
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:53,867
I will not see him.
I will not betray my husband.

228
00:15:54,161 --> 00:15:56,320
Then the man you love will die tonight.

229
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:59,032
I do not love Uther!

230
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:03,662
Sister, listen,
because there isn't much time.

231
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:08,000
Gorlois is planning to
surprise Uther while he sleeps.

232
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:10,467
You must warn him.

233
00:16:10,845 --> 00:16:13,170
Save him,
and save Avalon.

234
00:16:15,015 --> 00:16:17,720
But like all of us of the old ways...

235
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:22,306
..you must believe that this is not
the only life where we could have met.

236
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:30,691
There's something between
our souls already.

237
00:16:41,292 --> 00:16:45,753
Now my mother could see how
she could save Uther's life...

238
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:50,080
..but she did not see the terrible
price we would all have to pay.

239
00:17:50,027 --> 00:17:53,443
There he is,
sleeping away his last night on earth.

240
00:17:54,282 --> 00:17:56,773
I want Uther deep in his dreams...

241
00:17:56,867 --> 00:17:59,441
..when I drive my sword in his chest.

242
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:03,661
Uther!

243
00:18:08,379 --> 00:18:09,873
What was that?

244
00:18:17,972 --> 00:18:21,222
There's magic at work.
I can feel it!

245
00:18:35,656 --> 00:18:36,652
Uther?

246
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:41,567
Gorlois is not at Cameldun.

247
00:18:42,997 --> 00:18:45,322
His men are in the
hills above your camp.

248
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:49,168
Save yourselves.

249
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:53,997
Save yourselves.

250
00:18:55,301 --> 00:18:56,297
Igraine?

251
00:19:03,518 --> 00:19:05,890
Sir, are you not well?

252
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,857
Let's prepare, Captain...

253
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:15,228
..to show how we best welcome a traitor.

254
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:54,735
Uther!

255
00:21:10,478 --> 00:21:12,601
We can stop this now, Gorlois.

256
00:21:12,814 --> 00:21:13,928
It's up to you!

257
00:21:28,788 --> 00:21:30,163
Mother, where are you?

258
00:21:31,207 --> 00:21:32,073
Mother?

259
00:21:37,338 --> 00:21:39,046
- She'll be all right.
- Iraine!

260
00:21:39,173 --> 00:21:41,166
There are herbs that will cure her.

261
00:21:41,259 --> 00:21:42,670
Let's get her into bed.

262
00:21:59,027 --> 00:22:00,307
Open the gate!

263
00:22:00,403 --> 00:22:01,601
The Duchess is ill.

264
00:22:01,696 --> 00:22:03,938
- We have to find the herbs!
- Open the gate.

265
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:05,989
We have orders not to,
my lady.

266
00:22:06,075 --> 00:22:06,775
What?

267
00:22:06,868 --> 00:22:10,403
Neither you, nor Lady Igraine can
leave the castle in the Duke's absence.

268
00:22:10,497 --> 00:22:11,742
My mother is dying.

269
00:22:11,831 --> 00:22:14,203
I'm sorry.
I have my orders.

270
00:22:25,136 --> 00:22:27,176
- Be careful, Morgaine.
- All right.

271
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:31,048
It's over there,
by the trees.

272
00:22:51,704 --> 00:22:55,370
See Morgaine there?
Fetch her.

273
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:06,718
Come along, Morgaine.

274
00:23:06,803 --> 00:23:09,555
Would you fly in the face
of your father's authority?

275
00:23:10,181 --> 00:23:12,719
The herbs are for my mother.
She's dying.

276
00:23:13,184 --> 00:23:14,678
Captain!
That's enough.

277
00:23:17,188 --> 00:23:18,730
Now let me pass.

278
00:23:19,524 --> 00:23:21,896
Not you, Merlin,
nor any man.

279
00:23:22,277 --> 00:23:24,269
Not even your Lord Gorlois.

280
00:23:30,076 --> 00:23:33,030
Sir, I recognize your armour.

281
00:23:34,164 --> 00:23:37,165
But, sir,
I must do as you commanded me.

282
00:23:37,375 --> 00:23:39,119
I must ask to see your face.

283
00:23:41,796 --> 00:23:43,588
Show him your face, Gorlois.

284
00:23:58,605 --> 00:23:59,980
Let my daughter go.

285
00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:01,853
Father!

286
00:24:05,403 --> 00:24:08,938
I was overjoyed that my father
had come safely back to us...

287
00:24:10,158 --> 00:24:11,866
..but then I saw the dragon...

288
00:24:13,662 --> 00:24:15,405
..and I began to understand.

289
00:24:31,805 --> 00:24:33,263
What are you doing here?

290
00:24:33,515 --> 00:24:35,388
I'm waiting for my father.

291
00:24:36,351 --> 00:24:38,640
He's upstairs,
with your mother.

292
00:24:38,853 --> 00:24:40,312
My father is dead.

293
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:43,731
Well, if your father is dead...

294
00:24:44,901 --> 00:24:46,775
..then who would that be upstairs?

295
00:24:47,404 --> 00:24:49,112
The man with the dragon.

296
00:24:58,039 --> 00:24:59,831
The man of the prophesy.

297
00:25:04,838 --> 00:25:06,629
You be wary of Viviane, child.

298
00:25:08,008 --> 00:25:09,917
She'll catch you in her web...

299
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:13,544
..like a little fly, just as she's
tried to do to the rest of us.

300
00:25:14,222 --> 00:25:15,930
She won't have me, though.

301
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:19,175
I've learned how to keep
a step ahead of her.

302
00:25:48,173 --> 00:25:49,548
This is witchcraft.

303
00:25:57,516 --> 00:25:59,140
He challenged the High King.

304
00:25:59,684 --> 00:26:02,092
It was not Uther's wish to kill him.

305
00:26:02,354 --> 00:26:03,599
He had no choice.

306
00:26:15,408 --> 00:26:17,366
What went through my mother's mind...

307
00:26:17,452 --> 00:26:21,497
..as she saw her husband lying dead
at the hand of Uther Pendragon?

308
00:26:29,131 --> 00:26:30,589
None of this mattered...

309
00:26:30,674 --> 00:26:32,631
..to my Aunt Morgause...

310
00:26:32,801 --> 00:26:34,710
..because in King Lot of Orkney...

311
00:26:35,053 --> 00:26:37,675
..she saw at last,
her own path to power.

312
00:26:41,309 --> 00:26:44,761
For the first time,
I saw Uther Pendragon face to face...

313
00:26:45,063 --> 00:26:47,898
..and began to understand
the power of Avalon.

314
00:26:48,692 --> 00:26:51,562
Britain's greatest
Christian warrior was dead.

315
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:54,904
King Uther alone would turn
back the Saxon hordes...

316
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:59,107
..and Avalon would be saved by
one who believed in the Goddess.

317
00:27:02,873 --> 00:27:05,446
Uther took us to his
castle at Camelot...

318
00:27:05,542 --> 00:27:07,998
..and made my mother his High Queen.

319
00:28:06,353 --> 00:28:09,769
All the unhappiness of the
past seemed to be swept away...

320
00:28:10,232 --> 00:28:13,517
..when I saw my little brother, Arthur,
for the first time.

321
00:28:23,245 --> 00:28:24,075
Help me.

322
00:28:28,542 --> 00:28:30,914
Arthur!
Morgaine!

323
00:29:12,336 --> 00:29:14,044
What are they doing?

324
00:29:14,546 --> 00:29:17,084
They're praying to the
Goddess for a good harvest.

325
00:29:17,216 --> 00:29:20,216
The Goddess?
The one Father Cuthbert doesn't like?

326
00:29:27,935 --> 00:29:30,936
And now she'll look after their seeds,
and make them grow...

327
00:29:31,021 --> 00:29:32,646
..all through spring.

328
00:29:32,731 --> 00:29:35,400
So these people don't like Jesus Christ?

329
00:29:35,943 --> 00:29:37,651
Some of them do.

330
00:29:37,736 --> 00:29:39,693
But others still pray to the Goddess.

331
00:29:40,781 --> 00:29:43,402
Can there be a God and a
Goddess at the same time?

332
00:29:43,492 --> 00:29:48,154
Of course. It's just like
having a father and a mother.

333
00:29:56,171 --> 00:29:59,125
It was a time of happiness
for me and my little brother.

334
00:29:59,967 --> 00:30:02,209
And it seemed my new father...

335
00:30:02,553 --> 00:30:05,922
..King Uther,
would keep the Saxons at bay forever.

336
00:30:12,187 --> 00:30:16,399
Then one day I heard a familiar
voice down in the royal chamber...

337
00:30:16,775 --> 00:30:19,860
..and I knew that everything
was about to change again.

338
00:30:21,488 --> 00:30:23,362
You shall now teach your son.

339
00:30:23,532 --> 00:30:24,777
But he's still a boy.

340
00:30:24,908 --> 00:30:27,862
Arthur must be fostered to
protect his future destiny...

341
00:30:28,036 --> 00:30:30,076
..and to protect him from his enemies.

342
00:30:30,414 --> 00:30:32,656
It was an agreement you
made a long time ago.

343
00:30:35,252 --> 00:30:36,450
And with this...

344
00:30:36,628 --> 00:30:39,832
..you must give me Morgaine
to foster in Avalon.

345
00:30:41,842 --> 00:30:42,791
Never.

346
00:30:43,052 --> 00:30:44,332
She has the Sight.

347
00:30:45,512 --> 00:30:48,549
She was born with it.
She can never escape the Unseen.

348
00:30:48,724 --> 00:30:50,681
I'd rather raise her
as a Christian woman.

349
00:30:50,768 --> 00:30:51,550
No!

350
00:30:51,685 --> 00:30:55,054
At worst, no harm could come
to her behind convent walls.

351
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:57,188
The girl was born to be a priestess.

352
00:30:57,816 --> 00:31:00,023
She must be properly
trained to her gifts.

353
00:31:00,277 --> 00:31:01,652
Enough of this, woman!

354
00:31:02,404 --> 00:31:04,444
You're in my land now,
where I'm king.

355
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:05,938
You are king.

356
00:31:07,826 --> 00:31:09,202
But who put you there?

357
00:31:09,286 --> 00:31:11,824
How long do you think you'll
hold on to the throne...

358
00:31:11,914 --> 00:31:13,823
..if Avalon withdraws its support?

359
00:31:13,916 --> 00:31:17,119
You'd bring ruin to your own
sister in order to have your way?

360
00:31:17,336 --> 00:31:21,001
I'd do anything to see that Arthur
and Morgaine fulfil their destinies.

361
00:31:22,091 --> 00:31:26,503
You can't take both my children
from me at the same time.

362
00:31:27,012 --> 00:31:30,013
Your children will be safe and happy...

363
00:31:30,766 --> 00:31:32,805
..each growing toward their own fate.

364
00:31:33,102 --> 00:31:35,260
You must learn to be
content with that...

365
00:31:35,813 --> 00:31:37,437
..and with each other.

366
00:31:40,526 --> 00:31:43,480
You will always be in my heart, always.

367
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:46,405
Goodbye, Mother.

368
00:31:48,409 --> 00:31:49,523
Father.

369
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,396
- What are you doing?
- Mother?

370
00:32:27,281 --> 00:32:29,570
- Where are you taking him?
- You must understand.

371
00:32:29,658 --> 00:32:33,110
You each have training to undergo.
It must happen in different places.

372
00:32:33,203 --> 00:32:35,196
No!
You can't take my brother away from me!

373
00:32:35,289 --> 00:32:36,700
Don't leave me, Morgaine!

374
00:32:36,790 --> 00:32:37,953
Arthur!

375
00:32:40,127 --> 00:32:43,294
Don't take him away from me, please!
I'll do anything you ask!

376
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:45,124
I'll be good!
I promise!

377
00:32:45,216 --> 00:32:46,840
We all make sacrifices.

378
00:32:46,926 --> 00:32:50,626
What we want and what's right
are sometimes different things.

379
00:32:54,433 --> 00:32:57,054
You must give him your strength, child.

380
00:33:03,484 --> 00:33:05,311
We'll be strong, Arthur,
won't we?

381
00:33:09,573 --> 00:33:11,365
That game we play:

382
00:33:11,450 --> 00:33:14,534
At night,
if you get scared,
you can call to me...

383
00:33:16,288 --> 00:33:19,622
..and if you hold your breath and
listen hard enough in the dark...

384
00:33:19,708 --> 00:33:22,081
..you'll hear me whisper back to you.

385
00:33:31,971 --> 00:33:34,047
I'll never leave your side.

386
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:40,136
- Goodbye.
- 'Bye.

387
00:33:45,234 --> 00:33:46,645
Come, Morgaine.

388
00:33:49,113 --> 00:33:51,236
Leaving my parents was hard...

389
00:33:51,490 --> 00:33:54,776
..but leaving my little brother
was almost more than I could bear.

390
00:33:56,620 --> 00:34:00,832
Still, on that day we parted,
one north, one south...

391
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:03,908
..riding towards our separate fates.

392
00:34:27,318 --> 00:34:29,275
The Goddess is everything in nature...

393
00:34:30,321 --> 00:34:32,812
..and everything in nature is sacred.

394
00:34:34,366 --> 00:34:37,486
Look.
That is her face.

395
00:34:40,122 --> 00:34:40,952
Listen.

396
00:34:43,542 --> 00:34:44,918
That is her voice.

397
00:34:46,962 --> 00:34:49,335
She's in everything that is beautiful.

398
00:34:50,174 --> 00:34:52,463
And everything that
is harrowing as well.

399
00:34:54,387 --> 00:34:58,135
The guardians of Avalon appeared
silently on the hilltops...

400
00:34:58,224 --> 00:35:01,889
..as we came nearer the lake that
enclosed the mysterious island.

401
00:35:11,570 --> 00:35:15,520
When we reached the edge of the
lake and looked out into the mist...

402
00:35:15,616 --> 00:35:20,195
..I couldn't believe that behind it lay
all the wonders that I'd dreamt about.

403
00:35:20,705 --> 00:35:21,985
Where are we?

404
00:35:22,123 --> 00:35:23,996
On the borders of Avalon.

405
00:35:24,667 --> 00:35:26,706
This is Avalon?

406
00:36:18,221 --> 00:36:22,929
As we moved closer to the mists,
a chill crept across my heart.

407
00:36:23,392 --> 00:36:25,966
If I passed through that curtain...

408
00:36:26,062 --> 00:36:29,312
..would I ever be able to return
to my little brother Arthur?

409
00:36:36,572 --> 00:36:37,983
Is that Avalon?

410
00:36:38,074 --> 00:36:40,113
It looks like a Christian monastery.

411
00:36:40,201 --> 00:36:41,399
It does.

412
00:36:41,494 --> 00:36:44,246
But Avalon is beneath it,
behind it...

413
00:36:45,122 --> 00:36:46,581
..deeper in the mist.

414
00:36:47,667 --> 00:36:50,751
It was there long before the
Christians built their monastery.

415
00:37:38,801 --> 00:37:40,545
How beautiful!

416
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:43,555
Beautiful, yes.

417
00:37:44,474 --> 00:37:48,602
But unless we succeed in our quest,
it's also doomed.

418
00:38:00,990 --> 00:38:06,281
I finally arrived and was about to enter
the great sisterhood of the Goddess.

419
00:39:01,426 --> 00:39:02,836
What is your name?

420
00:39:05,013 --> 00:39:06,127
Her name is Raven.

421
00:39:06,556 --> 00:39:09,177
She's taken a vow of
silence to the Goddess.

422
00:39:11,436 --> 00:39:13,559
But silence,
I think,
is not for you.

423
00:39:14,105 --> 00:39:16,892
You have your own challenges to meet.

424
00:39:19,611 --> 00:39:20,357
Come.

425
00:39:26,326 --> 00:39:28,567
The Goddess holds all things in balance:

426
00:39:29,412 --> 00:39:34,074
Good and evil,
death and rebirth.

427
00:39:34,709 --> 00:39:37,995
The predator and the prey.

428
00:39:38,922 --> 00:39:42,504
Without her,
destruction and chaos will prevail.

429
00:39:45,136 --> 00:39:48,885
And so began my initiation
into the secrets of Avalon.

430
00:39:49,349 --> 00:39:53,761
A path that would lead me to become
a priestess of the ancient religion.

431
00:39:54,312 --> 00:39:57,645
Gradually, I began to look on the
Mother Goddess as my own mother...

432
00:39:58,816 --> 00:40:01,354
..and as the mother of the earth itself.

433
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:20,627
But there was more to being a
priestess than acquiring knowledge.

434
00:40:21,506 --> 00:40:25,550
There was also the task of acquiring
power over every element...

435
00:40:26,094 --> 00:40:27,636
..one by one.

436
00:40:45,530 --> 00:40:46,858
How did you do that?

437
00:40:49,075 --> 00:40:50,984
Show me, Viviane.
I want to learn.

438
00:41:13,808 --> 00:41:15,053
Morgaine!

439
00:41:30,617 --> 00:41:33,024
Morgaine, you have to concentrate.

440
00:41:35,830 --> 00:41:37,289
But I saw my brother.

441
00:41:37,707 --> 00:41:40,744
You must learn to distinguish
visions from reality.

442
00:41:41,836 --> 00:41:44,541
This time,
keep your mind in one place.

443
00:42:18,415 --> 00:42:19,790
It would take years...

444
00:42:19,916 --> 00:42:23,914
..until I was deemed ready
for the greatest test of all:

445
00:42:24,087 --> 00:42:27,207
To part the mists of Avalon.

446
00:43:06,296 --> 00:43:09,499
And at last,
I was fit to be given the sacred mark...

447
00:43:09,758 --> 00:43:12,842
..that only those dedicated
to the Goddess may wear.

448
00:43:28,944 --> 00:43:31,565
Welcome to the service of the Goddess.

449
00:43:36,868 --> 00:43:38,327
She's been taken.

450
00:43:52,842 --> 00:43:54,502
As a priestess of Avalon...

451
00:43:54,594 --> 00:43:57,880
..I was bidden one day to
open the mists for a visitor.

452
00:43:58,265 --> 00:44:02,476
I was certain that my longing for
my brother would finally be over.

453
00:44:02,727 --> 00:44:03,723
Arthur?

454
00:44:18,034 --> 00:44:20,952
Not Arthur, lady.
But his cousin.

455
00:44:21,246 --> 00:44:23,404
Your cousin,
I think,
if you're Morgaine.

456
00:44:23,498 --> 00:44:26,036
My cousin?
By whom?

457
00:44:26,293 --> 00:44:28,119
Your mentor,
the Lady of the Lake.

458
00:44:29,754 --> 00:44:31,830
- Then you must be...
- Lancelot.

459
00:44:33,717 --> 00:44:36,718
You can embrace me if you like.
We are family after all.

460
00:44:39,055 --> 00:44:39,802
Come.

461
00:44:39,890 --> 00:44:42,974
Lancelot had not come for the
pleasure of seeing his relatives.

462
00:44:43,268 --> 00:44:46,222
He had come to confront
his mother, Viviane.

463
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:48,638
Even you can't want me
to stay in Avalon...

464
00:44:48,732 --> 00:44:50,974
..while the Saxons
destroy the real world.

465
00:44:51,067 --> 00:44:52,775
Then Avalon's not real for you?

466
00:44:53,403 --> 00:44:54,732
Not as real as battle.

467
00:44:57,324 --> 00:44:59,482
You always say we
mustn't deny our nature.

468
00:44:59,910 --> 00:45:02,401
Well, it's my nature to
fight at the front lines.

469
00:45:02,621 --> 00:45:04,779
If you stayed here to
gather our wisdom...

470
00:45:05,081 --> 00:45:08,415
..you could lead the struggle,
rather than being caught up in it.

471
00:45:10,295 --> 00:45:12,703
I have come here for your blessing.

472
00:45:12,798 --> 00:45:14,541
I'd be glad to have it.

473
00:45:15,884 --> 00:45:17,343
I'm asking for it, lady...

474
00:45:17,427 --> 00:45:20,761
..but in truth, I will set my course
with or without your blessing.

475
00:45:20,847 --> 00:45:24,845
I've lived in a world where
men do not wait on a woman's
bidding to come and go.

476
00:45:24,935 --> 00:45:26,762
How dare you speak to me like that?

477
00:45:26,895 --> 00:45:28,010
Mother, please.

478
00:45:28,105 --> 00:45:30,181
Don't think you can soften me on this.

479
00:45:30,941 --> 00:45:33,432
Mother, I don't expect to
soften you on anything.

480
00:45:34,277 --> 00:45:36,484
Go up to the stone circle,
both of you.

481
00:45:36,988 --> 00:45:40,737
If you must say your
farewells to Avalon, I insist
you make them from there.

482
00:45:41,076 --> 00:45:42,107
Why, Mother?

483
00:45:42,452 --> 00:45:45,786
You wish me to approve of your decision?
Then do as I ask.

484
00:46:31,293 --> 00:46:34,294
I think you spend too
much time riding horses.

485
00:46:35,756 --> 00:46:36,954
Well, this is it.

486
00:46:37,966 --> 00:46:40,374
This is what your mother
wanted me to show you.

487
00:46:40,844 --> 00:46:42,042
Nonsense.

488
00:46:42,596 --> 00:46:44,304
You must know my mother by now.

489
00:46:46,642 --> 00:46:50,556
She wanted us to feel the power of
the Ring together, so I would...

490
00:46:50,687 --> 00:46:52,680
So you might decide to stay.

491
00:46:53,857 --> 00:46:55,731
She's full of strategy,
my mother.

492
00:46:56,193 --> 00:46:57,770
I think you may be right.

493
00:46:59,321 --> 00:47:00,696
I do feel it, though.

494
00:47:02,741 --> 00:47:03,737
The Ring.

495
00:47:06,495 --> 00:47:08,487
I can feel it flowing through me.

496
00:47:11,250 --> 00:47:15,543
I felt it as a child,
but now it's different.

497
00:47:17,714 --> 00:47:18,959
Do you feel it?

498
00:47:19,925 --> 00:47:23,970
Of course.
I am of the same blood as you.

499
00:47:31,853 --> 00:47:32,553
Look.

500
00:47:37,067 --> 00:47:40,187
The Christians.
Can they see us?

501
00:47:40,946 --> 00:47:43,982
No. They're in Glastonbury.
We're in Avalon.

502
00:47:44,533 --> 00:47:46,572
They can't even see the stones.

503
00:47:53,542 --> 00:47:55,997
- Are you sure they can't see us?
- Yes.

504
00:47:59,256 --> 00:48:00,631
She senses something.

505
00:48:07,973 --> 00:48:10,511
You can part the veil between worlds.
Do it!

506
00:48:10,642 --> 00:48:13,133
No, I will not use the arts for play.

507
00:48:13,562 --> 00:48:14,973
This is not play.

508
00:48:15,898 --> 00:48:18,139
Or is it because you
can't do it, Cousin?

509
00:48:34,249 --> 00:48:35,791
Where did you come from?

510
00:48:36,126 --> 00:48:37,502
Don't be frightened.

511
00:48:37,836 --> 00:48:39,496
We haven't come from anywhere.

512
00:48:39,963 --> 00:48:41,755
You have.
You're in Avalon.

513
00:48:43,383 --> 00:48:45,210
One of the fairy people.

514
00:48:46,637 --> 00:48:48,345
Keep her away from me.

515
00:48:48,972 --> 00:48:50,301
She's not a fairy.

516
00:48:50,891 --> 00:48:52,385
She's as mortal as you are.

517
00:48:56,063 --> 00:48:57,522
I'm Lancelot...

518
00:48:57,773 --> 00:48:59,849
..and this is my cousin, Morgaine.

519
00:49:01,652 --> 00:49:02,648
Who are you?

520
00:49:04,613 --> 00:49:08,064
Guinevere.
Daughter of King Loedekrantz.

521
00:49:11,078 --> 00:49:12,572
I must be dreaming.

522
00:49:12,663 --> 00:49:14,988
This can't be Avalon.
Avalon doesn't exist.

523
00:49:15,332 --> 00:49:16,743
It does.

524
00:49:19,670 --> 00:49:21,912
Where does it lead,
that path?

525
00:49:23,382 --> 00:49:25,754
Down to the lawns and the groves.

526
00:49:26,385 --> 00:49:29,006
Each place is more
beautiful than the last.

527
00:49:33,851 --> 00:49:35,511
May I stay a while?

528
00:49:36,020 --> 00:49:37,763
Will you show them to me?

529
00:49:40,357 --> 00:49:41,520
Of course.

530
00:49:42,443 --> 00:49:44,352
You may stay as long as you like.

531
00:49:52,953 --> 00:49:54,531
Can you hear me?

532
00:49:55,748 --> 00:49:57,028
Where did you go?

533
00:49:59,001 --> 00:49:59,866
Lancelot?

534
00:50:18,562 --> 00:50:20,519
She's trained you well,
your mentor.

535
00:50:21,565 --> 00:50:23,225
What do you mean by that?

536
00:50:24,360 --> 00:50:28,571
For a moment there, when I
looked at you, it was just
like looking at my mother.

537
00:50:33,452 --> 00:50:36,619
I know she's waiting.
I shall go and give her my decision now.

538
00:50:37,164 --> 00:50:39,121
And what have you decided, Cousin?

539
00:50:39,917 --> 00:50:42,040
I have the power to lead men in battle.

540
00:50:43,671 --> 00:50:45,248
That's what I intend to do.

541
00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:49,047
As Lancelot announced his decision...

542
00:50:50,010 --> 00:50:54,138
..deep within me there stirred
something I had felt for no man before.

543
00:50:55,641 --> 00:50:58,558
Within days,
on the orders of Viviane...

544
00:50:58,894 --> 00:51:02,310
..I was on my way to take part
in the fertility rites known...

545
00:51:02,439 --> 00:51:04,064
..as the Beltane feast...

546
00:51:04,733 --> 00:51:07,937
..the ceremony she called
"the great marriage".

547
00:51:09,113 --> 00:51:11,782
To whom I would be given,
I did not know.

548
00:51:12,074 --> 00:51:15,823
But Viviane assured me that
the future of Avalon...

549
00:51:15,953 --> 00:51:19,571
..depended on my playing the
role of the virgin huntress...

550
00:51:20,624 --> 00:51:24,574
..and that my partner would be
the man who killed the king stag.

551
00:55:39,926 --> 00:55:44,552
As I returned to the Holy Isle,
a great longing gripped my heart:

552
00:55:45,556 --> 00:55:49,803
I hoped that the man at the
Beltane rites had been Lancelot.

553
00:55:51,229 --> 00:55:53,684
But I had never seen his face.

554
00:55:53,773 --> 00:55:56,727
There had been no hint
as to who he really was.

555
00:56:02,824 --> 00:56:05,741
Who was she?
When can I see her again?

556
00:56:06,035 --> 00:56:08,656
You were only meant to know
her for one night, Arthur.

557
00:56:09,163 --> 00:56:10,574
Well, you can conjure.

558
00:56:10,665 --> 00:56:12,990
At least show me her face.
I never saw her face.

559
00:56:13,084 --> 00:56:16,085
You will never know the
identity of the virgin huntress.

560
00:56:16,671 --> 00:56:20,004
That knowledge is sacred
and you must let it be.

561
00:56:21,592 --> 00:56:26,800
Your training is over,
and you must return to the new world.

562
00:56:26,889 --> 00:56:28,134
Why now?

563
00:56:29,100 --> 00:56:30,808
Because your father needs you.

564
00:56:36,607 --> 00:56:39,181
As Arthur rode in search
of his father that day...

565
00:56:40,111 --> 00:56:42,780
..Uther Pendragon was
facing his greatest test.

566
00:56:43,448 --> 00:56:46,199
The Saxons had descended
on Britain again...

567
00:56:46,617 --> 00:56:47,946
..in force.

568
00:56:56,294 --> 00:56:57,290
Father!

569
00:57:27,325 --> 00:57:28,867
- Father!
- Arthur.

570
00:57:32,080 --> 00:57:35,116
You've come home only
in time to see me die.

571
00:57:35,667 --> 00:57:37,077
You're not going to die!

572
00:57:37,293 --> 00:57:40,579
My boy,
let's forget this world now...

573
00:57:41,339 --> 00:57:43,462
..and let's talk about the next.

574
00:57:44,759 --> 00:57:48,093
Come closer to me.
I'm cold.

575
00:57:50,682 --> 00:57:51,630
Come, my boy.

576
00:57:51,724 --> 00:57:53,005
I'm here.

577
00:57:53,643 --> 00:57:56,478
And so ends the High Kingdom of Britain.

578
00:57:57,897 --> 00:58:00,934
It is a great pity you never
had the chance to rule.

579
00:58:01,818 --> 00:58:04,439
I think you would have been a good king.

580
00:58:09,909 --> 00:58:11,190
Father!

581
00:58:38,396 --> 00:58:40,139
- Arthur!
- I know.

582
00:58:40,231 --> 00:58:41,642
There isn't any time.

583
00:58:49,991 --> 00:58:52,696
I call on the powers
of heaven and earth:

584
00:58:53,077 --> 00:58:54,358
Aid me now!

585
00:58:55,538 --> 00:58:58,954
I call on the God of heaven
and the Goddess of the earth!

586
00:58:59,042 --> 00:59:00,204
Help me now!

587
00:59:02,128 --> 00:59:04,335
You called on God and the Goddess.

588
00:59:04,923 --> 00:59:06,749
It is the Goddess who answers.

589
00:59:09,260 --> 00:59:10,754
Listen, Arthur.

590
00:59:11,262 --> 00:59:13,504
You are ready to be High King.

591
00:59:13,890 --> 00:59:18,351
And this will be granted to you,
if you have the support of Avalon.

592
00:59:19,354 --> 00:59:21,181
Avalon will lift you up...

593
00:59:21,773 --> 00:59:24,180
..if you promise to obey the old ways...

594
00:59:24,275 --> 00:59:27,027
..and keep the Goddess
alive in men's hearts.

595
00:59:30,114 --> 00:59:30,980
Swear it!

596
00:59:31,950 --> 00:59:32,945
I swear!

597
00:59:33,785 --> 00:59:35,694
Then look to the altar.

598
00:59:37,789 --> 00:59:38,951
It is Excalibur...

599
00:59:40,333 --> 00:59:42,409
..the great sword of Avalon.

600
00:59:45,672 --> 00:59:47,960
You are blessed by the Goddess.

601
00:59:48,258 --> 00:59:50,297
You have the strength to draw it.

602
00:59:54,639 --> 00:59:56,181
Take it, Arthur!

603
01:00:00,979 --> 01:00:02,473
Take it and rule.

604
01:00:04,482 --> 01:00:05,976
Take it, Arthur.

605
01:00:15,910 --> 01:00:17,286
Take it and rule.

606
01:00:24,085 --> 01:00:26,161
Arthur?

607
01:00:30,467 --> 01:00:31,842
Call to Excalibur!

608
01:00:37,223 --> 01:00:40,427
To me,
men of Britain!
To me!

609
01:00:45,899 --> 01:00:47,856
Arthur turned the tide of battle...

610
01:00:47,942 --> 01:00:50,943
..and the Saxons were thrown
back from our shores...

611
01:00:51,571 --> 01:00:53,647
..for a time at least.

612
01:00:53,990 --> 01:00:57,110
As the day approached for his
coronation as High King...

613
01:00:57,452 --> 01:01:00,369
..all of Britain seemed to
be gathering at Camelot...

614
01:01:00,955 --> 01:01:03,707
..to celebrate the
beginning of a new era.

615
01:01:27,273 --> 01:01:30,559
Even King Lot of Orkney had come
down from his Scottish Islands...

616
01:01:31,236 --> 01:01:34,735
..with my Aunt Morgause
as his wife and queen.

617
01:01:35,198 --> 01:01:37,950
- My dear child.
- You can't call me that anymore.

618
01:01:38,618 --> 01:01:40,694
Morgaine, Morgaine.

619
01:01:40,912 --> 01:01:43,154
- Mother, is this my cousin?
- It is.

620
01:01:43,248 --> 01:01:45,739
This is Gawain,
our firstborn.

621
01:01:47,544 --> 01:01:49,786
It's an honour to meet
a priestess of Avalon.

622
01:01:49,921 --> 01:01:51,748
The pleasure is mine.

623
01:01:52,257 --> 01:01:54,926
I've heard many interesting
things about the place.

624
01:01:55,552 --> 01:01:58,755
They say you make yourselves
tiny and ride around on sparrows.

625
01:02:00,140 --> 01:02:02,761
I think the fancy is more
interesting than the facts.

626
01:02:02,934 --> 01:02:05,721
It is good fortune that
you returned, Morgaine.

627
01:02:06,271 --> 01:02:09,023
Your mother will take great
comfort from your presence.

628
01:02:09,482 --> 01:02:10,597
Where is she?

629
01:02:16,323 --> 01:02:17,354
Mother?

630
01:02:32,464 --> 01:02:33,875
I lost them all.

631
01:02:35,467 --> 01:02:37,958
All those years when
you were a little girl.

632
01:02:39,471 --> 01:02:42,009
I should have been with you,
not Viviane.

633
01:02:42,682 --> 01:02:44,971
I should never have allowed it.

634
01:02:46,811 --> 01:02:50,180
Mother, you had no choice.

635
01:02:54,110 --> 01:02:57,361
He used to sit there,
where you are now,
when he was at home.

636
01:02:59,032 --> 01:03:03,077
You must not let this grief keep you
from celebrating Arthur's accession.

637
01:03:05,747 --> 01:03:07,028
Morgaine...

638
01:03:07,624 --> 01:03:10,625
..when Arthur is crowned,
I'm going to go to Glastonbury.

639
01:03:10,710 --> 01:03:12,833
Why don't you come to Avalon with me?

640
01:03:14,339 --> 01:03:16,082
I've given enough to Avalon.

641
01:03:16,842 --> 01:03:19,629
Your mother has many Christian friends.

642
01:03:20,178 --> 01:03:21,803
They will be good to her.

643
01:03:23,306 --> 01:03:25,299
You mean you'll be taking vows?

644
01:03:28,311 --> 01:03:32,095
I've buried two husbands.
I won't love again.

645
01:03:33,233 --> 01:03:35,060
And now Uther has gone.

646
01:03:35,485 --> 01:03:39,186
I need forgiveness for what
I did to your father...

647
01:03:42,117 --> 01:03:44,323
..and I'll only find
that in Glastonbury.

648
01:03:51,376 --> 01:03:52,372
Remember...

649
01:03:53,587 --> 01:03:56,042
..the future of Camelot
lies within you all.

650
01:04:15,067 --> 01:04:16,062
Watch them.

651
01:04:23,075 --> 01:04:24,617
Come on,
watch the eyes.

652
01:04:27,412 --> 01:04:30,698
Kay, keep that shield up.
Otherwise, Bedevere will have your neck.

653
01:04:49,476 --> 01:04:51,054
Here, my friend.

654
01:05:19,589 --> 01:05:23,005
And that's what happens when you
let the king teach you how to fight.

655
01:05:23,135 --> 01:05:24,166
Almost a king.

656
01:05:32,769 --> 01:05:34,228
Another bride for you.

657
01:05:34,896 --> 01:05:37,933
Come. You must meet her.
This one is special.

658
01:05:38,609 --> 01:05:40,435
The Bishop wants me to marry her.

659
01:05:41,445 --> 01:05:44,066
You are ever welcome at Camelot, miss.

660
01:05:44,156 --> 01:05:46,611
It's an honour to attend
so brave a warrior.

661
01:05:46,700 --> 01:05:48,194
Then you must meet another.

662
01:05:48,285 --> 01:05:50,324
This is my good friend, Lancelot.

663
01:05:53,165 --> 01:05:56,450
Will you lift your veil?
You have an unfair advantage over us.

664
01:06:06,720 --> 01:06:07,883
Lancelot...

665
01:06:08,972 --> 01:06:10,846
..Guinevere of Loedekrantz.

666
01:06:15,979 --> 01:06:17,224
Say something.

667
01:06:19,816 --> 01:06:21,476
I'm your servant, miss.

668
01:06:24,696 --> 01:06:28,065
He is a man of few words, my lady,
but he is our finest soldier.

669
01:06:33,080 --> 01:06:35,238
- Who's that?
- Who?

670
01:06:35,332 --> 01:06:36,957
Up there,
on the balcony.

671
01:06:39,086 --> 01:06:42,040
Don't you recognize your own sister?
That's Morgaine.

672
01:06:42,798 --> 01:06:45,253
Come from Avalon to honour you tomorrow.

673
01:06:49,179 --> 01:06:51,386
Excuse me, my lady, I
must greet my sister.

674
01:07:18,584 --> 01:07:20,126
Where's my little brother?

675
01:07:23,255 --> 01:07:26,541
He's here.
He's still here.

676
01:07:26,633 --> 01:07:28,128
Should we go and get the horses?

677
01:07:28,218 --> 01:07:31,053
No, a single horse,
and ride like we used to.

678
01:07:40,481 --> 01:07:42,141
The good times have returned.

679
01:07:42,900 --> 01:07:44,939
I hear you've met a hundred princesses.

680
01:07:45,319 --> 01:07:46,979
Come, I'll show you something.

681
01:07:47,237 --> 01:07:48,897
You see that girl down there?

682
01:07:52,117 --> 01:07:54,240
You must promise to tell no one.

683
01:07:55,579 --> 01:07:57,121
We're to be married.

684
01:07:57,664 --> 01:07:58,863
Do you love her?

685
01:08:00,167 --> 01:08:01,330
I will, Sister.

686
01:08:02,169 --> 01:08:04,043
There is someone else,
isn't there?

687
01:08:05,172 --> 01:08:05,954
No.

688
01:08:06,173 --> 01:08:07,288
There is.

689
01:08:07,841 --> 01:08:10,000
You cannot fool a priestess of Avalon.

690
01:08:13,347 --> 01:08:16,763
There is.
There has been someone else.

691
01:08:17,851 --> 01:08:19,559
It was a wonderful night...

692
01:08:19,687 --> 01:08:20,635
But?

693
01:08:21,063 --> 01:08:23,684
- Why do you press me so?
- A sister's privilege.

694
01:08:23,857 --> 01:08:25,233
Tell me her name.

695
01:08:26,610 --> 01:08:27,725
I don't know.

696
01:08:28,529 --> 01:08:29,904
You didn't ask?

697
01:08:32,366 --> 01:08:33,529
We didn't speak.

698
01:08:34,034 --> 01:08:35,826
Will you see her again?

699
01:08:37,204 --> 01:08:38,698
I want to, Sister.

700
01:08:39,248 --> 01:08:40,908
But I don't know where she is.

701
01:08:41,166 --> 01:08:43,124
At least tell me what she looks like.

702
01:08:44,128 --> 01:08:45,705
I don't know that either.

703
01:08:46,672 --> 01:08:48,296
How can you not know that?

704
01:08:49,925 --> 01:08:51,717
She was wearing a mask.

705
01:08:53,679 --> 01:08:55,387
It was at the rites of Beltane.

706
01:08:56,265 --> 01:09:00,559
I was consecrated there.
We made love.

707
01:09:01,729 --> 01:09:04,136
It was everything I've ever dreamt of.

708
01:09:07,401 --> 01:09:08,860
I tell you, Sister...

709
01:09:09,737 --> 01:09:13,984
..something about that girl's
eyes will be watching me forever.

710
01:09:17,161 --> 01:09:18,240
Arthur!

711
01:09:21,540 --> 01:09:23,414
I must tend my duties.

712
01:09:25,210 --> 01:09:27,880
You will come down and join us,
won't you?

713
01:09:27,963 --> 01:09:29,920
You must meet my future bride.

714
01:09:57,743 --> 01:10:00,495
My Aunt Morgause used magic...

715
01:10:00,704 --> 01:10:03,492
..against a woman she
had decided to hate.

716
01:10:03,958 --> 01:10:05,452
By the fire...

717
01:10:07,044 --> 01:10:08,419
..and the stone...

718
01:10:09,505 --> 01:10:10,916
..by the water...

719
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:14,342
..and the air...

720
01:10:15,469 --> 01:10:17,378
..I curse you...

721
01:10:22,393 --> 01:10:24,635
..Guinevere of Loedekrantz.

722
01:10:24,854 --> 01:10:27,142
I curse you forever!

723
01:11:39,845 --> 01:11:42,336
By Excalibur,
I swear that I...

724
01:11:43,265 --> 01:11:45,591
..Arthur Pendragon,
King of Britain...

725
01:11:46,477 --> 01:11:50,226
..will deal fairly with Druid
as with Christian alike.

726
01:11:51,482 --> 01:11:54,234
All men shall worship as they choose.

727
01:11:55,486 --> 01:11:57,064
My hand for justice!

728
01:11:59,490 --> 01:12:00,735
One kingdom...

729
01:12:01,492 --> 01:12:04,742
..the old wisdom,
and the new!

730
01:12:04,829 --> 01:12:10,250
One kingdom united here, at Camelot, to
stand against the tides of barbarism.

731
01:12:20,469 --> 01:12:22,261
Brothers and sisters!

732
01:12:25,016 --> 01:12:29,309
We have not only one joy to
celebrate today, but two.

733
01:12:29,854 --> 01:12:31,562
Today, our king...

734
01:12:32,273 --> 01:12:34,016
..has pledged fidelity...

735
01:12:34,108 --> 01:12:35,567
..to Britain...

736
01:12:35,776 --> 01:12:37,271
..to Avalon...

737
01:12:37,612 --> 01:12:39,070
..to the Holy Father.

738
01:12:39,739 --> 01:12:42,111
And he has promised to marry...

739
01:12:42,575 --> 01:12:45,778
..the Christian princess
Guinevere of Loedekrantz.

740
01:12:55,963 --> 01:12:57,623
He has the people's passion.

741
01:12:58,341 --> 01:13:00,380
If anyone can save Britain...

742
01:13:00,593 --> 01:13:01,672
..he can.

743
01:13:03,596 --> 01:13:06,087
He'll have to do it in his own lifetime.

744
01:13:09,143 --> 01:13:10,341
What have you done?

745
01:13:10,811 --> 01:13:13,647
No son of his will
follow him to the throne.

746
01:13:14,982 --> 01:13:16,145
Ours will.

747
01:13:16,943 --> 01:13:18,816
Long live King Arthur!

748
01:13:43,261 --> 01:13:44,885
Don't leave me, Morgaine!

749
01:14:07,451 --> 01:14:08,862
What is it, lamb?

750
01:14:09,537 --> 01:14:11,530
Was it the excitement in there?

751
01:14:12,373 --> 01:14:14,081
No, Morgause,
it's not that.

752
01:14:14,750 --> 01:14:16,375
What is it then?

753
01:14:17,545 --> 01:14:19,004
I think I'm with child.

754
01:14:40,026 --> 01:14:41,650
After the coronation...

755
01:14:41,736 --> 01:14:44,405
..Arthur rode off to visit
the border country...

756
01:14:44,822 --> 01:14:47,740
..leaving Guinevere in Lancelot's care.

757
01:14:47,825 --> 01:14:49,948
Arthur has a great mind for leadership.

758
01:14:50,036 --> 01:14:52,361
I would've never let the
tribesmen fight alone.

759
01:14:52,914 --> 01:14:55,120
That's because you're
a warrior, Lancelot.

760
01:14:55,792 --> 01:14:59,207
You like to throw yourself
into the fray, come what may.

761
01:15:00,379 --> 01:15:02,917
You must think me a simple man, indeed.

762
01:15:35,206 --> 01:15:36,237
Lancelot!

763
01:15:39,460 --> 01:15:40,492
Guinevere!

764
01:16:26,841 --> 01:16:30,340
- Are you hurt, my lady?
- No. I'm fine.

765
01:16:31,471 --> 01:16:33,262
But you risked your life for me.

766
01:16:33,932 --> 01:16:34,963
It's my duty.

767
01:16:36,851 --> 01:16:39,176
Your devotion moves me.

768
01:16:39,896 --> 01:16:42,303
My devotion has no end,
my lady.

769
01:16:47,737 --> 01:16:51,023
I must confess something,
to be rid of it.

770
01:16:53,076 --> 01:16:55,033
Then we must say nothing more.

771
01:16:59,207 --> 01:17:01,164
I dreamt of you in Glastonbury.

772
01:17:03,169 --> 01:17:07,712
You opened a curtain into
Avalon and lifted me in.

773
01:17:17,809 --> 01:17:22,056
It wasn't a dream.
I was there with Morgaine.

774
01:17:22,188 --> 01:17:23,386
She lifted you in.

775
01:17:24,399 --> 01:17:26,226
But I asked her to do it.

776
01:17:29,904 --> 01:17:31,696
So you felt it, too?

777
01:17:35,618 --> 01:17:37,362
But I am sworn to Arthur.

778
01:17:39,122 --> 01:17:40,035
As am I.

779
01:17:41,791 --> 01:17:43,748
So we have nothing to confess.

780
01:17:45,211 --> 01:17:47,749
But I have sinned with
you in my thoughts.

781
01:17:49,966 --> 01:17:51,959
Thoughts are not deeds.

782
01:17:52,510 --> 01:17:55,511
The Bishop says,
"To think is to do".

783
01:17:56,681 --> 01:17:59,137
My thoughts don't answer to the Bishop.

784
01:17:59,267 --> 01:18:02,268
If they did,
I would burn in hell a thousand years...

785
01:18:02,395 --> 01:18:05,016
..every time I see you walk past.

786
01:18:05,899 --> 01:18:08,271
Hell is very real to me.

787
01:18:09,652 --> 01:18:12,060
We must do nothing about this.

788
01:18:13,448 --> 01:18:15,440
Are you listening to me?

789
01:18:16,159 --> 01:18:16,941
Swear.

790
01:18:17,035 --> 01:18:18,695
- Swear what?
- To do nothing.

791
01:18:18,787 --> 01:18:20,826
I don't intend to sin against my king.

792
01:18:20,955 --> 01:18:22,580
Why, then,
won't you swear?

793
01:18:38,431 --> 01:18:41,883
There will be nothing between us.

794
01:18:46,231 --> 01:18:47,808
Will there,
my love?

795
01:18:56,491 --> 01:18:57,654
I'm afraid.

796
01:18:58,118 --> 01:18:59,280
Of course you are.

797
01:19:00,745 --> 01:19:01,990
But don't worry.

798
01:19:03,164 --> 01:19:05,951
I used it myself,
before I was married.

799
01:19:07,001 --> 01:19:08,626
It even has a pleasant taste.

800
01:19:10,672 --> 01:19:12,083
Now, take your medicine.

801
01:19:17,846 --> 01:19:18,960
Drink, Morgaine.

802
01:19:20,724 --> 01:19:21,922
You'll be free.

803
01:19:23,351 --> 01:19:24,347
Drink.

804
01:19:28,773 --> 01:19:29,971
What are you doing?

805
01:19:32,986 --> 01:19:36,604
She's carrying a child she doesn't want.
I'm helping her to get rid of it.

806
01:19:36,698 --> 01:19:38,322
Leave us, Morgause.

807
01:19:42,037 --> 01:19:44,741
I'm not an infant,
crawling at your skirts, Viviane.

808
01:19:45,081 --> 01:19:47,370
Nor am I one of your
adoring priestesses.

809
01:19:48,001 --> 01:19:51,002
I'm a queen in my own right,
wife of Lot of Orkney.

810
01:19:51,087 --> 01:19:53,543
You do not order me to go or stay.

811
01:19:53,882 --> 01:19:55,459
I said,
"Leave us".

812
01:20:06,728 --> 01:20:09,764
How could you do this to me?
To us?

813
01:20:11,107 --> 01:20:12,934
I never intended for you to know.

814
01:20:13,360 --> 01:20:14,735
Well, I do know now.

815
01:20:15,737 --> 01:20:18,489
How could you have arranged
for such an abomination?

816
01:20:19,240 --> 01:20:21,233
It is my sacred charge, Morgaine.

817
01:20:22,494 --> 01:20:24,819
You and Arthur are the
last remaining links...

818
01:20:24,913 --> 01:20:27,119
..between this land
and the world of mists.

819
01:20:27,791 --> 01:20:30,412
Those links are becoming
weaker with every year.

820
01:20:30,585 --> 01:20:33,337
I must do everything in my
power to keep them alive.

821
01:20:33,588 --> 01:20:36,838
Even if it means sacrificing
everyone you've ever loved?

822
01:20:36,925 --> 01:20:39,416
Even if it means
sacrificing my very soul.

823
01:20:40,387 --> 01:20:43,056
That is what being the Lady
of the Lake truly demands.

824
01:20:43,139 --> 01:20:45,132
As you, too,
will find out.

825
01:20:45,517 --> 01:20:46,430
I?

826
01:20:46,601 --> 01:20:47,882
Why, of course.

827
01:20:49,020 --> 01:20:52,187
What else has all your training,
all your suffering, been for...

828
01:20:52,399 --> 01:20:54,937
..if not to fit you to be
the Lady after I'm gone?

829
01:20:55,986 --> 01:20:58,192
You have a greatness of soul, Morgaine.

830
01:20:58,613 --> 01:20:59,942
I can see it.

831
01:21:00,615 --> 01:21:02,407
I've seen it all along.

832
01:21:03,118 --> 01:21:06,403
I am carrying a bastard child
fathered by my own brother.

833
01:21:06,496 --> 01:21:08,370
You are carrying Arthur's successor.

834
01:21:09,165 --> 01:21:11,538
Would you have Morgause
murder it in the womb...

835
01:21:11,626 --> 01:21:14,580
..in order to have her son
step into Arthur's shoes?

836
01:21:16,131 --> 01:21:16,961
No.

837
01:21:17,215 --> 01:21:19,042
If you bear no child...

838
01:21:19,134 --> 01:21:22,918
..the offspring of Lot and Morgause
will be next in line for the throne.

839
01:21:23,930 --> 01:21:26,801
Why else is she so
solicitous of your needs?

840
01:21:27,684 --> 01:21:28,882
I don't believe it.

841
01:21:28,977 --> 01:21:30,008
Then go ahead.

842
01:21:30,437 --> 01:21:33,106
Let her ambitions shape
the nation's future.

843
01:21:34,441 --> 01:21:37,561
Morgause thinks of nothing and
no one but herself, Morgaine.

844
01:21:40,447 --> 01:21:42,819
Your motives may be nobler than hers...

845
01:21:42,908 --> 01:21:46,656
..but you still move us around
like pieces on a game board.

846
01:21:46,953 --> 01:21:49,242
What has my mother given
up for your Avalon?

847
01:21:49,956 --> 01:21:52,744
My father died at Uther's
hands because of you.

848
01:21:53,668 --> 01:21:55,744
My poor,
innocent brother, Arthur...

849
01:21:55,837 --> 01:21:59,586
..who was a baby on my lap,
and loved me as no other.

850
01:22:00,675 --> 01:22:02,086
And I loved him.

851
01:22:03,011 --> 01:22:04,589
Look what you've done to us.

852
01:22:05,597 --> 01:22:10,508
You've twisted our love and turned it
into shame, all for the sake of Avalon!

853
01:22:15,440 --> 01:22:16,436
No!

854
01:22:17,359 --> 01:22:19,435
I will not kill the child within me...

855
01:22:19,528 --> 01:22:21,686
..but I will not let
you take him to Avalon.

856
01:22:22,197 --> 01:22:24,605
I will not let you twist
and bend him to your will.

857
01:22:24,699 --> 01:22:27,819
I can train him to be the greatest
ruler Britain has ever seen.

858
01:22:27,911 --> 01:22:30,069
He will never set foot
in Avalon, Viviane.

859
01:22:30,205 --> 01:22:32,530
He will not be one of
your pawns and nor will I.

860
01:22:32,666 --> 01:22:34,908
You have sworn to obey
the Goddess through me.

861
01:22:35,085 --> 01:22:37,042
My vows were to her,
not to you.

862
01:22:37,295 --> 01:22:39,087
I renounce you.
Do you hear me?

863
01:22:39,172 --> 01:22:41,129
I will never set foot in Avalon again.

864
01:22:41,216 --> 01:22:42,247
You will obey!

865
01:22:42,342 --> 01:22:43,373
Never!

866
01:23:12,429 --> 01:23:14,587
Where else was there for me to go...

867
01:23:14,681 --> 01:23:18,097
..but with Morgause and Lot
into the wilds of Orkney?

868
01:23:18,351 --> 01:23:22,894
There, my child could disappear into
the teeming brood in Lot's castle.

869
01:23:23,440 --> 01:23:25,064
Eat and enjoy!

870
01:23:25,608 --> 01:23:29,108
No man will ever say I
don't keep a great hall...

871
01:23:32,115 --> 01:23:34,487
..even in the depths of winter.

872
01:23:40,623 --> 01:23:43,375
I saved the best cut for you, Morgaine.

873
01:23:43,835 --> 01:23:46,077
Wasn't it you who told
me the best meat...

874
01:23:46,171 --> 01:23:49,125
..for a breeding woman
was the liver of a stag...

875
01:23:49,549 --> 01:23:50,794
..eaten raw?

876
01:24:02,479 --> 01:24:05,183
The baby's coming.
Quick, get her to her chambers.

877
01:24:05,273 --> 01:24:06,648
It's all right.

878
01:24:14,282 --> 01:24:15,657
Wife, wait.

879
01:24:16,159 --> 01:24:18,828
You're quick to bring our
son's rival into this world.

880
01:24:19,746 --> 01:24:21,573
If this child dies...

881
01:24:21,665 --> 01:24:24,831
..and Guinevere fails to
produce an heir for Arthur...

882
01:24:25,168 --> 01:24:26,413
..then our son...

883
01:24:27,003 --> 01:24:28,628
..will be High King.

884
01:24:29,255 --> 01:24:32,126
You think on that as you bring
this infant into the world.

885
01:24:32,676 --> 01:24:34,419
You think well on it.

886
01:24:37,764 --> 01:24:39,472
Morgaine, swallow.

887
01:24:40,183 --> 01:24:41,049
Push.

888
01:24:41,267 --> 01:24:43,556
It's all right,
Lady Morgaine.

889
01:24:52,195 --> 01:24:54,188
Push, push!

890
01:25:06,751 --> 01:25:07,831
Morgaine!

891
01:25:11,840 --> 01:25:13,667
Why are you hidden from my sight?

892
01:25:20,724 --> 01:25:22,597
She won't be able to feed him yet.

893
01:25:22,893 --> 01:25:24,173
Poor babe.

894
01:25:24,269 --> 01:25:26,178
But the wet nurse is ready.

895
01:25:29,649 --> 01:25:31,227
Shall I take him,
my lady?

896
01:25:31,735 --> 01:25:33,063
The woman's waiting.

897
01:25:33,153 --> 01:25:34,232
Not yet.

898
01:26:59,322 --> 01:27:00,520
Mother.

899
01:27:07,748 --> 01:27:08,696
Yes, child.

900
01:27:09,958 --> 01:27:11,832
Mother, forgive me.

901
01:27:14,129 --> 01:27:15,409
For what?

902
01:27:17,007 --> 01:27:18,287
Arthur...

903
01:27:21,094 --> 01:27:22,886
..he doesn't know.

904
01:27:24,556 --> 01:27:26,513
Arthur is the father?

905
01:27:27,559 --> 01:27:30,430
Don't tell him.
Please.

906
01:27:30,562 --> 01:27:32,436
Please, don't tell him.

907
01:28:04,471 --> 01:28:06,298
Let me hold him.

908
01:28:09,101 --> 01:28:10,974
Let me hold him just once.

909
01:28:20,237 --> 01:28:21,268
Leave us.

910
01:28:26,827 --> 01:28:28,950
What is this, woman?
The child is alive.

911
01:28:29,037 --> 01:28:30,579
And will remain so.

912
01:28:31,123 --> 01:28:32,202
Why?

913
01:28:32,916 --> 01:28:34,245
It is Arthur's child.

914
01:28:41,967 --> 01:28:43,130
Son of a king.

915
01:28:45,095 --> 01:28:47,586
- She told you?
- In her fever.

916
01:28:47,931 --> 01:28:49,425
She doesn't know I know.

917
01:28:50,767 --> 01:28:52,475
Son of a High King.

918
01:28:53,353 --> 01:28:55,595
No matter how many sons he has...

919
01:28:56,607 --> 01:28:59,145
..this child will
always be his firstborn.

920
01:29:00,652 --> 01:29:03,322
With this secret,
we have a weapon in our hands.

921
01:29:05,032 --> 01:29:06,442
Think of it, Husband.

922
01:29:07,951 --> 01:29:12,530
His flesh,
his blood,
his heir.

923
01:29:13,707 --> 01:29:17,871
But my instruction,
my influence.

924
01:29:18,837 --> 01:29:22,787
I'll teach him to have little need
of Morgaine and great need of me.

925
01:29:23,467 --> 01:29:25,459
And as the years pass...

926
01:29:25,552 --> 01:29:28,506
..Britain will become
more and more our own.

927
01:29:31,475 --> 01:29:33,467
It's time for his first meal.

928
01:29:35,979 --> 01:29:38,649
A new and dreadful power was unleashed.

929
01:29:39,149 --> 01:29:42,814
And the fate of all Britain
was altered forever.

930
01:30:02,631 --> 01:30:06,130
It was as if my life had
become lost in the mists.

931
01:30:06,426 --> 01:30:09,926
Everything that I loved
and cherished was gone.

932
01:30:10,013 --> 01:30:13,347
I thought there was nothing more
that could be taken from me.

933
01:30:13,433 --> 01:30:15,011
How wrong I was.

934
01:30:16,145 --> 01:30:20,142
But at Camelot, it seemed that high
summer had come to Britain at last.

935
01:30:20,691 --> 01:30:24,735
Under the rule of a good, brave man,
with the Knights of the Round Table...

936
01:30:24,820 --> 01:30:27,062
..our beleaguered country was at peace.

937
01:30:28,282 --> 01:30:31,152
Arthur was the High King
everyone had hoped for...

938
01:30:31,452 --> 01:30:33,409
..and Guinevere,
his queen.

939
01:30:39,293 --> 01:30:41,084
I've missed you,
my love.

940
01:30:42,129 --> 01:30:43,707
Are you ill?

941
01:30:44,256 --> 01:30:46,213
My courses have come on me again.

942
01:30:46,842 --> 01:30:49,131
Why do you let them distress you so?

943
01:30:49,887 --> 01:30:52,378
But it means I haven't given you a son.

944
01:30:52,473 --> 01:30:54,761
I haven't given you an heir.

945
01:30:56,435 --> 01:30:59,934
We are young yet.
We have years for children.

946
01:31:01,065 --> 01:31:04,896
Now, get dressed. The troops have
returned victorious, as I promised...

947
01:31:05,944 --> 01:31:08,649
..and they expect to see
the queen by my side.

948
01:31:22,086 --> 01:31:23,248
Arthur!

949
01:31:33,514 --> 01:31:34,794
What is it, Morgaine?

950
01:31:35,015 --> 01:31:36,391
I'm fine.

951
01:31:38,268 --> 01:31:40,178
Another bad dream?

952
01:31:40,521 --> 01:31:43,142
Mom, why do you have so many bad dreams?

953
01:31:44,108 --> 01:31:46,681
Some people are born that way,
my poppet.

954
01:31:47,903 --> 01:31:51,023
It's like,
some people have brown hair...

955
01:31:51,115 --> 01:31:53,321
..and some people have yellow hair.

956
01:31:54,451 --> 01:31:55,910
Some people see things.

957
01:31:57,496 --> 01:31:59,572
Not yet.
He's far too young.

958
01:32:03,335 --> 01:32:06,953
Strange, that in the peace of
Orkney I should feel distracted so.

959
01:32:09,008 --> 01:32:11,166
Why don't you go back to Camelot?

960
01:32:12,845 --> 01:32:14,090
What about my child?

961
01:32:14,847 --> 01:32:17,420
We'll be fine on our own,
won't we, poppet?

962
01:32:18,392 --> 01:32:20,515
You've quite won him away from me.

963
01:32:21,520 --> 01:32:23,347
We're twin souls,
he and I.

964
01:32:23,564 --> 01:32:26,684
Now I'll have him all for myself,
won't that be nice?

965
01:32:28,193 --> 01:32:30,186
You must promise me one thing:

966
01:32:31,322 --> 01:32:33,813
Never let Viviane get
her hands on Mordred.

967
01:32:34,450 --> 01:32:37,285
She wants to foster him.
You must never allow it.

968
01:32:37,536 --> 01:32:38,615
I promise.

969
01:32:54,094 --> 01:32:57,926
And so the day came when
I returned to Camelot...

970
01:32:58,265 --> 01:33:00,637
..the beating heart of Britain itself...

971
01:33:00,851 --> 01:33:03,342
..and the place where I
had spent my childhood...

972
01:33:03,437 --> 01:33:05,264
..with my little brother, Arthur.

973
01:33:27,211 --> 01:33:28,207
Knights.

974
01:33:30,130 --> 01:33:32,289
My sister has returned from Orkney.

975
01:33:34,051 --> 01:33:36,624
- You remember Gawain.
- Morgaine.

976
01:33:37,930 --> 01:33:41,595
Percival, Gallahad, Accolon.

977
01:33:43,769 --> 01:33:46,723
I heard you were educated
on the Isle of Mists.

978
01:33:47,439 --> 01:33:49,266
I was trained there as a priestess.

979
01:33:49,650 --> 01:33:51,275
I long to go there one day...

980
01:33:51,360 --> 01:33:53,685
..and know the mysteries
of the hidden world.

981
01:33:53,779 --> 01:33:54,775
My lord...

982
01:33:54,905 --> 01:33:57,028
..aren't you going to
present me as well?

983
01:33:57,116 --> 01:34:00,319
- My queen.
- We've met briefly,
but hardly spoke at all.

984
01:34:00,953 --> 01:34:03,622
It's more fitting that I
should bow to you, Morgaine.

985
01:34:03,956 --> 01:34:06,910
You were in the king's
affections long before I was.

986
01:34:07,251 --> 01:34:09,540
Come, let us talk as sisters...

987
01:34:09,879 --> 01:34:11,670
..for sisters is what we are.

988
01:34:23,350 --> 01:34:25,841
I will not pretend I
am not afraid of you.

989
01:34:27,146 --> 01:34:29,719
I was raised in great
suspicion of the old religion.

990
01:34:30,357 --> 01:34:32,730
But your head tells you we're the same.

991
01:34:34,153 --> 01:34:36,442
Something like that, yes.

992
01:34:37,239 --> 01:34:38,235
And yet...

993
01:34:38,407 --> 01:34:40,364
We couldn't be more different.

994
01:34:40,659 --> 01:34:41,655
Very good.

995
01:34:42,119 --> 01:34:44,491
They taught you well to
read another's thoughts.

996
01:34:44,830 --> 01:34:47,784
I read another's thoughts
as well as any woman can.

997
01:34:49,794 --> 01:34:52,498
But the training, Morgaine...

998
01:34:53,172 --> 01:34:55,544
..it must have been good for something.

999
01:34:56,133 --> 01:35:00,213
For instance, did Avalon train
you in herb lore and spells?

1000
01:35:01,764 --> 01:35:02,843
Of course.

1001
01:35:04,892 --> 01:35:06,849
Tell me what I'm thinking now.

1002
01:35:09,605 --> 01:35:11,183
I couldn't guess.

1003
01:35:12,441 --> 01:35:15,063
Then I will say it aloud,
if I must.

1004
01:35:17,613 --> 01:35:18,728
There are herbs...

1005
01:35:19,156 --> 01:35:22,656
..that can make a woman conceive,
are there not?

1006
01:35:23,953 --> 01:35:25,447
Is that what you want?

1007
01:35:27,164 --> 01:35:30,368
Please do not make this any
harder than it already is.

1008
01:35:32,712 --> 01:35:34,870
There is a charm that is sometimes used.

1009
01:35:36,007 --> 01:35:38,130
But you, surely,
would never touch it.

1010
01:35:41,220 --> 01:35:43,462
Tell me you are not a witch.

1011
01:35:44,724 --> 01:35:46,965
Tell me it is not the
devil's own spell...

1012
01:35:47,059 --> 01:35:49,218
..and that I will not burn for it.

1013
01:35:50,605 --> 01:35:53,274
This time,
this one time...

1014
01:35:53,941 --> 01:35:55,566
..I will believe you.

1015
01:36:00,239 --> 01:36:02,730
You will have it by
the night of Beltane.

1016
01:36:10,917 --> 01:36:13,075
There, my friend.
Everything's all right.

1017
01:36:13,169 --> 01:36:14,912
You'll gallop like a colt!

1018
01:36:25,431 --> 01:36:27,258
You have a way with horses.

1019
01:36:27,975 --> 01:36:30,513
Better than with people,
I sometimes think.

1020
01:36:31,395 --> 01:36:34,480
All people,
or just some people?

1021
01:36:35,733 --> 01:36:37,061
I'm speaking of women.

1022
01:36:37,151 --> 01:36:39,856
I would have thought
you'd have a bride by now.

1023
01:36:41,239 --> 01:36:44,275
Or does your heart still long
for the woman you can't have?

1024
01:36:46,410 --> 01:36:47,786
The rumours are not true.

1025
01:36:47,870 --> 01:36:50,278
You may speak of it to me, Cousin.

1026
01:36:50,623 --> 01:36:53,244
After all,
I'm the one that brought it about.

1027
01:36:53,376 --> 01:36:55,664
I lifted her into your world.

1028
01:36:56,754 --> 01:36:59,459
Little did I know all that
would come from that moment.

1029
01:37:01,300 --> 01:37:04,800
I love Arthur more than I
have ever loved another man.

1030
01:37:05,012 --> 01:37:07,254
But whatever else is in my head,
or my heart...

1031
01:37:07,348 --> 01:37:09,388
..will stay with me until I die.

1032
01:37:10,226 --> 01:37:13,096
And do you know what is in
my head and in my heart?

1033
01:37:16,482 --> 01:37:18,641
I feel the loss of you,
dear Cousin.

1034
01:37:20,695 --> 01:37:22,522
No one touched me like you did.

1035
01:37:23,823 --> 01:37:27,322
And still,
even now,
I yearn for you.

1036
01:37:33,332 --> 01:37:35,574
I have fought many battles, Morgaine...

1037
01:37:37,587 --> 01:37:40,837
..but none like the one I
fought since that day in Avalon.

1038
01:37:55,021 --> 01:37:56,515
Come to bed, Arthur.

1039
01:38:43,903 --> 01:38:45,812
The moon waxed and waned...

1040
01:38:45,905 --> 01:38:48,740
..and the time of the
fertility rites of Beltane...

1041
01:38:49,158 --> 01:38:50,950
..came round again.

1042
01:38:52,662 --> 01:38:54,453
This will make me conceive?

1043
01:38:54,747 --> 01:38:58,247
Don't be surprised if the charm works
better than you think it should.

1044
01:38:58,334 --> 01:39:00,623
The ways of the Goddess are her own.

1045
01:39:00,753 --> 01:39:02,710
Seems fitting,
doesn't it?

1046
01:39:02,922 --> 01:39:05,876
The night of Beltane,
but I don't care.

1047
01:39:06,426 --> 01:39:08,833
Let them practice their pagan magic...

1048
01:39:08,928 --> 01:39:11,419
..if their goddess will
bring me a child...

1049
01:39:40,293 --> 01:39:42,120
Drink, men, drink.

1050
01:39:42,462 --> 01:39:45,961
We'll have our own Beltane
celebration within these walls...

1051
01:39:46,090 --> 01:39:47,288
..where it's safe.

1052
01:41:12,886 --> 01:41:14,463
You would walk without light?

1053
01:41:15,346 --> 01:41:17,422
There is light enough over there.

1054
01:41:18,224 --> 01:41:20,466
It's dangerous to light
the fires these days.

1055
01:41:20,560 --> 01:41:22,054
The priests don't like it.

1056
01:41:23,229 --> 01:41:25,601
The priests are becoming more powerful.

1057
01:41:27,192 --> 01:41:30,395
But tonight,
just tonight...

1058
01:41:31,613 --> 01:41:33,605
..we can forget about the priests.

1059
01:41:36,743 --> 01:41:38,451
Shall we walk,
my lord?

1060
01:42:05,814 --> 01:42:06,928
My queen.

1061
01:42:08,608 --> 01:42:12,273
Guinevere and Lancelot.

1062
01:42:12,779 --> 01:42:15,448
Two people I love most in the world.

1063
01:42:15,615 --> 01:42:17,442
Do you love me,
both of you?

1064
01:42:21,496 --> 01:42:24,947
Sometimes I think Lancelot
is the best of us.

1065
01:42:25,417 --> 01:42:26,745
Up you come.

1066
01:42:31,715 --> 01:42:34,585
Come, lie beside me.
Both of you.

1067
01:42:35,301 --> 01:42:36,961
I want to talk to you...

1068
01:42:37,512 --> 01:42:39,718
..and if drink won't help me say this...

1069
01:42:39,806 --> 01:42:41,549
..it will never be said.

1070
01:42:43,643 --> 01:42:45,137
Guinevere has no child.

1071
01:42:49,232 --> 01:42:51,806
Don't you think I see how
you two look at each other?

1072
01:42:51,901 --> 01:42:53,277
- Arthur...
- No.

1073
01:42:54,362 --> 01:42:56,521
I will get to the end of this...

1074
01:42:57,657 --> 01:42:59,816
..even if I have to
command your silence.

1075
01:43:01,828 --> 01:43:04,995
My wife thinks it's her
fault we have no child...

1076
01:43:07,208 --> 01:43:09,166
..but I believe it's me.

1077
01:43:09,502 --> 01:43:12,587
Yes, sometimes the
fault lies with the man.

1078
01:43:12,964 --> 01:43:14,423
Even when that man is king.

1079
01:43:14,507 --> 01:43:17,212
Arthur, please do not
continue with this.

1080
01:43:17,344 --> 01:43:19,502
My kingdom needs an heir,
my sweet.

1081
01:43:20,221 --> 01:43:23,139
Otherwise, everything
I'm fighting for is lost.

1082
01:43:30,023 --> 01:43:31,766
A son of yours, Lancelot...

1083
01:43:32,275 --> 01:43:34,434
..conceived in the king's bed...

1084
01:43:34,778 --> 01:43:36,521
..would be heir to my throne.

1085
01:43:38,240 --> 01:43:42,533
Better that, than the son of
Lot should reign, is it not?

1086
01:43:43,745 --> 01:43:47,363
Sure, Bishop Patricius would
say it was a grievous sin...

1087
01:43:48,208 --> 01:43:52,751
..but I say it's a greater sin to
provide no son to inherit my crown...

1088
01:43:53,547 --> 01:43:55,919
..and let the kingdom
slip into such chaos...

1089
01:43:56,007 --> 01:43:59,293
..as there was before my
father came to the throne.

1090
01:44:01,555 --> 01:44:02,717
My friend...

1091
01:44:03,974 --> 01:44:07,556
..my cousin,
will you do this for me?

1092
01:44:18,864 --> 01:44:20,571
It's for my lady to say.

1093
01:44:24,578 --> 01:44:27,947
My lord, no. I have
given my vows to you.

1094
01:44:28,039 --> 01:44:29,154
To me, yes.

1095
01:44:29,916 --> 01:44:33,416
To be mine, and to obey me,
as your husband and your king.

1096
01:44:33,962 --> 01:44:37,627
For years our forefathers have
done these things without shame...

1097
01:44:38,550 --> 01:44:42,133
..in the faces of the very same
gods who look over us tonight.

1098
01:44:49,436 --> 01:44:51,843
We will both be with you, together.

1099
01:44:54,024 --> 01:44:57,938
And if the child we want
should come of this...

1100
01:44:58,028 --> 01:45:00,815
..none of us need ever know for certain.

1101
01:45:02,616 --> 01:45:04,774
And you will be able to swear...

1102
01:45:07,120 --> 01:45:08,318
..in truth...

1103
01:45:09,456 --> 01:45:12,623
..that our child was
conceived in the king's bed.

1104
01:46:05,345 --> 01:46:07,801
I wish you were the
sister of some lesser man.

1105
01:47:51,869 --> 01:47:53,612
Good morning, Cousin.

1106
01:47:55,664 --> 01:47:57,455
You gave her a charm,
didn't you?

1107
01:47:58,500 --> 01:47:59,615
Guinevere?

1108
01:48:01,086 --> 01:48:02,497
She told me.

1109
01:48:03,046 --> 01:48:05,122
- It was not meant for you.
- Was it not?

1110
01:48:06,925 --> 01:48:09,381
I had no idea it would be you.

1111
01:48:10,637 --> 01:48:13,923
Then the ways of the Goddess
are beyond your understanding.

1112
01:48:18,228 --> 01:48:19,936
The king himself...

1113
01:48:20,481 --> 01:48:23,517
..asked me into his bed with the queen.

1114
01:48:26,111 --> 01:48:27,653
All three of you?

1115
01:48:41,293 --> 01:48:42,668
How can I go back...

1116
01:48:44,630 --> 01:48:46,669
..to the way things were?

1117
01:48:48,383 --> 01:48:50,376
How can I sit at his table...

1118
01:48:52,262 --> 01:48:55,762
..how can I kneel before him
and call myself his servant?

1119
01:48:58,352 --> 01:49:02,646
You are not to blame
for loving Guinevere.

1120
01:49:05,984 --> 01:49:07,443
What can I do?

1121
01:49:09,321 --> 01:49:10,863
Don't worry, Cousin.

1122
01:49:11,615 --> 01:49:13,442
We will put our heads together.

1123
01:49:17,329 --> 01:49:19,369
I just never dared hope...

1124
01:49:20,541 --> 01:49:23,826
..then the Lady Morgaine
told me there was hope.

1125
01:49:24,837 --> 01:49:28,371
And I spoke to him,
and he asked me.

1126
01:49:29,717 --> 01:49:31,377
Who asked you?

1127
01:49:32,094 --> 01:49:33,209
Lancelot.

1128
01:49:34,930 --> 01:49:38,097
Your Majesty,
I'm the happiest woman in England.

1129
01:49:41,019 --> 01:49:43,178
Lancelot asked you to be his wife?

1130
01:49:44,732 --> 01:49:46,060
And you said yes.

1131
01:49:48,027 --> 01:49:49,402
Of course you did.

1132
01:49:49,945 --> 01:49:51,736
What could be more natural?

1133
01:49:52,406 --> 01:49:53,686
Your Majesty?

1134
01:49:55,117 --> 01:49:57,074
You have a husband,
very good.

1135
01:49:57,161 --> 01:50:00,031
But do I have a child to give my king?
No.

1136
01:50:00,497 --> 01:50:03,451
That's what you'll whisper to
the rest of my women, isn't it?

1137
01:50:03,584 --> 01:50:05,576
"The queen has her courses again".

1138
01:50:06,253 --> 01:50:07,795
Get out of my sight!

1139
01:50:18,223 --> 01:50:20,631
- Two options: We can go to the north...
- Arthur.

1140
01:50:27,441 --> 01:50:28,852
Take over for me.

1141
01:50:34,531 --> 01:50:38,612
So much for the love of your friend.
So much for your dear sister's potions.

1142
01:50:38,786 --> 01:50:40,529
Guinevere, calm yourself.

1143
01:50:41,246 --> 01:50:42,705
What is it that brings you?

1144
01:50:42,790 --> 01:50:46,206
My courses have come on me, Arthur.
I bear you no child.

1145
01:50:46,961 --> 01:50:48,289
But, my queen...

1146
01:50:48,671 --> 01:50:50,959
I took poison from a witch...

1147
01:50:51,465 --> 01:50:54,501
..I slept with you and your
friend and gave myself...

1148
01:50:54,593 --> 01:50:58,128
..to your lust and ungodliness,
and all for nothing.

1149
01:50:58,472 --> 01:51:00,381
All for nothing!

1150
01:51:02,142 --> 01:51:05,143
No baby,
no baby.

1151
01:51:07,815 --> 01:51:09,226
Where is my baby?

1152
01:51:10,067 --> 01:51:13,566
It's in God's hands now,
not ours.

1153
01:51:16,156 --> 01:51:17,355
Don't cry.

1154
01:51:17,449 --> 01:51:20,450
God does not reward sinners.

1155
01:51:22,997 --> 01:51:25,618
We are all sinners,
my love.

1156
01:51:25,916 --> 01:51:28,039
He knows that and understands.

1157
01:51:29,378 --> 01:51:33,376
And He knows that you value
pagans equally with Christians...

1158
01:51:33,632 --> 01:51:36,254
..and fight under a banner
of the Mother Goddess...

1159
01:51:36,343 --> 01:51:38,834
..as if she were equal
to our Father in heaven.

1160
01:51:38,929 --> 01:51:41,385
Our Father may be in
heaven, Guinevere...

1161
01:51:41,974 --> 01:51:44,382
..but the Goddess is
Great Mother to us all.

1162
01:51:44,476 --> 01:51:46,683
She is not Great Mother to me.

1163
01:51:46,812 --> 01:51:48,390
She will not give me a child.

1164
01:51:48,480 --> 01:51:51,600
And while you honour her,
God will not give me a child either.

1165
01:51:51,692 --> 01:51:53,483
You say you are a good man...

1166
01:51:53,652 --> 01:51:55,859
..but you condemn your
wife to barrenness...

1167
01:51:55,946 --> 01:51:58,817
..for the sake of an
oath to painted savages.

1168
01:52:01,410 --> 01:52:03,699
I despise you,
Arthur Pendragon.

1169
01:52:04,580 --> 01:52:06,822
Neither good Christian,
nor good pagan...

1170
01:52:07,291 --> 01:52:09,367
..nor good husband to me.

1171
01:52:23,140 --> 01:52:26,640
And so,
Lancelot was married to the Lady Elaine.

1172
01:52:26,727 --> 01:52:28,886
And if he could not make me happy...

1173
01:52:29,021 --> 01:52:32,188
..at least he could fill her
simple soul with delight...

1174
01:52:32,358 --> 01:52:35,109
..and heal the wounds that
had been inflicted on him...

1175
01:52:35,194 --> 01:52:36,902
..by the magic of Avalon.

1176
01:52:37,196 --> 01:52:39,070
Has my mother come,
old Druid?

1177
01:52:39,990 --> 01:52:42,660
Your mother sends her blessings,
my son.

1178
01:52:42,743 --> 01:52:44,866
Perhaps she could not bear to see you...

1179
01:52:44,954 --> 01:52:48,405
..married under the banners
of Christianity all alone.

1180
01:52:49,750 --> 01:52:51,826
We'll visit her on the way to Pellinore.

1181
01:52:51,919 --> 01:52:53,413
Thank you, Morgaine.

1182
01:53:00,511 --> 01:53:01,424
Morgaine...

1183
01:53:02,471 --> 01:53:06,849
..the Lady of the Lake is heartsick that
you have withheld yourself from her.

1184
01:53:07,601 --> 01:53:09,309
I think of her often...

1185
01:53:10,062 --> 01:53:12,304
..though I'm committed to my course.

1186
01:53:14,066 --> 01:53:15,774
How does Viviane fare?

1187
01:53:15,860 --> 01:53:18,611
She longs to have you at her side.

1188
01:53:19,822 --> 01:53:23,025
She did what she did in
the service of the Goddess.

1189
01:53:23,701 --> 01:53:27,568
And although you reject her, you do
not reject the old ways, I think.

1190
01:53:28,456 --> 01:53:29,784
For which I honour you.

1191
01:53:31,292 --> 01:53:33,913
This is Accolon of Wales.

1192
01:53:34,545 --> 01:53:38,625
He also is strong in the old religion,
as is his father, Uriens.

1193
01:53:39,967 --> 01:53:42,541
We've already had the
pleasure to meet, Merlin.

1194
01:53:42,636 --> 01:53:44,795
Will you join me in a dance, lady?

1195
01:53:46,724 --> 01:53:48,551
If you can bring your horsemen...

1196
01:53:48,642 --> 01:53:51,478
..down from the Welsh hills,
we can trap the Jutes...

1197
01:53:51,562 --> 01:53:53,887
..before they breach
the line of the Avon.

1198
01:53:53,981 --> 01:53:55,641
It will be done,
Your Majesty.

1199
01:53:56,984 --> 01:53:59,440
Have you thought, sir,
of that boon I crave of you?

1200
01:53:59,528 --> 01:54:03,028
King Uriens has long been a
widower and wishes to remarry.

1201
01:54:03,491 --> 01:54:06,445
I asked His High Majesty if
there was a lady of your court...

1202
01:54:06,535 --> 01:54:09,620
..who would be willing to
become Queen of North Wales.

1203
01:54:14,251 --> 01:54:15,496
Morgaine.

1204
01:54:17,213 --> 01:54:18,493
Morgaine?

1205
01:54:19,090 --> 01:54:20,833
Is she not a little young?

1206
01:54:21,008 --> 01:54:24,211
I think she would be
happy with an older man.

1207
01:54:24,387 --> 01:54:26,510
She is no giddy,
young thing.

1208
01:54:29,016 --> 01:54:31,305
What do you think,
King Uriens?

1209
01:54:32,228 --> 01:54:33,852
The High King's own sister?

1210
01:54:37,692 --> 01:54:39,565
I would be honoured if she'd have me.

1211
01:54:40,987 --> 01:54:42,979
We will discuss this later,
my friend.

1212
01:54:43,072 --> 01:54:45,065
Thank you,
my lord.

1213
01:54:48,160 --> 01:54:49,655
Morgaine, for Uriens?

1214
01:54:50,746 --> 01:54:52,205
He is a good man...

1215
01:54:52,290 --> 01:54:55,207
..of the old religion
and an important ally.

1216
01:54:56,836 --> 01:54:58,875
Should we not at least ask her?

1217
01:55:00,798 --> 01:55:02,838
I think I know what her answer will be.

1218
01:55:08,097 --> 01:55:11,015
Morgaine, we have had an
offer of marriage for you.

1219
01:55:11,225 --> 01:55:13,182
Well, it has been broached.

1220
01:55:15,104 --> 01:55:18,722
You are asked to join yourself to
the royal house of North Wales.

1221
01:55:19,901 --> 01:55:21,146
It is a wild place.

1222
01:55:21,235 --> 01:55:23,394
And you will be far
from Camelot, Sister.

1223
01:55:23,529 --> 01:55:26,779
There is one of the old religion there,
who would wish to wed you.

1224
01:55:34,457 --> 01:55:37,244
I cannot pretend I am as
surprised as all that, Brother.

1225
01:55:39,587 --> 01:55:42,588
Why, the sly fellow.
He did not tell me he had spoken to you.

1226
01:55:45,259 --> 01:55:46,588
What shall I tell him?

1227
01:55:49,388 --> 01:55:52,010
You may tell him I'd be
happy to live in North Wales.

1228
01:55:57,772 --> 01:55:59,599
I'm happy for you, Morgaine.

1229
01:56:01,776 --> 01:56:03,021
Very happy.

1230
01:56:15,248 --> 01:56:16,956
Friends...

1231
01:56:17,500 --> 01:56:19,042
..on this auspicious day...

1232
01:56:19,127 --> 01:56:21,534
..I have yet another note
of happiness to sound.

1233
01:56:22,296 --> 01:56:24,289
My dear sister, Morgaine...

1234
01:56:24,465 --> 01:56:28,297
..is to be betrothed to
King Uriens of North Wales.

1235
01:56:36,436 --> 01:56:38,558
For a moment it did not sink in.

1236
01:56:39,021 --> 01:56:40,646
And then I realized:

1237
01:56:40,940 --> 01:56:44,190
I had been tricked into marrying
the father instead of the son...

1238
01:56:44,277 --> 01:56:46,519
..and there was nothing
I could do about it.

1239
01:56:47,363 --> 01:56:49,570
To have rejected Uriens
there and then...

1240
01:56:49,657 --> 01:56:52,326
..would have humiliated him
before the whole country...

1241
01:56:52,410 --> 01:56:54,983
..and cost my brother
the loyalty of Wales.

1242
01:56:56,247 --> 01:56:57,326
I was caught...

1243
01:56:58,499 --> 01:57:00,373
..like a fly in a web.

1244
01:57:20,438 --> 01:57:22,062
How could you let this happen?

1245
01:57:23,524 --> 01:57:25,316
There was little I could do.

1246
01:57:25,485 --> 01:57:27,940
First, they take down
the banners of Pendragon.

1247
01:57:28,029 --> 01:57:29,191
Then Morgaine...

1248
01:57:29,280 --> 01:57:33,230
..the one person who could've
kept the spirit of the
Goddess alive in Camelot...

1249
01:57:33,326 --> 01:57:36,327
..is sent to North Wales.
And why?

1250
01:57:36,454 --> 01:57:38,328
Because of some Christian ninny.

1251
01:57:39,499 --> 01:57:42,868
I have lost my strength, Viviane.

1252
01:57:45,880 --> 01:57:49,878
I feel the power of the Goddess...

1253
01:57:51,219 --> 01:57:52,761
..is no longer in me.

1254
01:57:52,845 --> 01:57:54,672
Why, you're just tired, Merlin.

1255
01:57:54,764 --> 01:57:56,721
It's been a long journey from Camelot.

1256
01:57:57,976 --> 01:58:01,890
I am more than just tired.

1257
01:58:05,692 --> 01:58:09,641
Surely, there are enough herbs in
Avalon to give you back your strength.

1258
01:58:09,737 --> 01:58:11,944
I shall ask Raven to fetch you some.

1259
01:58:12,073 --> 01:58:15,157
Please, don't leave me.

1260
01:58:16,119 --> 01:58:17,399
Please.

1261
01:58:22,333 --> 01:58:23,744
Poor Merlin.

1262
01:58:25,795 --> 01:58:27,420
I'm getting tired, too.

1263
01:58:28,548 --> 01:58:31,039
I'd hoped Morgaine
would put on my robes.

1264
01:58:32,677 --> 01:58:37,303
Perhaps no one will step
into your robes, Viviane.

1265
01:58:39,309 --> 01:58:40,423
Perhaps...

1266
01:58:41,102 --> 01:58:43,308
..Avalon will die with us.

1267
01:58:43,438 --> 01:58:45,430
Well, there's young Mordred yet.

1268
01:58:45,732 --> 01:58:46,894
He's coming of age.

1269
01:58:46,983 --> 01:58:48,442
He is our best hope.

1270
01:58:52,071 --> 01:58:55,606
We had a long fight together...

1271
01:58:57,202 --> 01:58:58,447
..you and I.

1272
01:58:59,454 --> 01:59:02,989
You have been a worthy partner.

1273
01:59:04,709 --> 01:59:07,829
I've learned everything
I know from you, Merlin.

1274
01:59:08,713 --> 01:59:11,002
We shall fight for many years to come.

1275
01:59:11,257 --> 01:59:14,258
No, I won't see any more wars.

1276
01:59:16,679 --> 01:59:18,304
But you will continue.

1277
01:59:20,517 --> 01:59:22,426
You have always...

1278
01:59:22,977 --> 01:59:25,931
..sacrificed everything for Avalon...

1279
01:59:26,773 --> 01:59:28,812
..and done so gladly.

1280
01:59:31,361 --> 01:59:35,987
Merlin, do you think
I've wasted my life?

1281
01:59:37,700 --> 01:59:38,696
No.

1282
01:59:40,328 --> 01:59:43,993
We gave everything to Avalon...

1283
01:59:44,833 --> 01:59:46,825
..because we had no choice.

1284
01:59:48,586 --> 01:59:51,706
- But we failed.
- No, we didn't fail.

1285
01:59:52,423 --> 01:59:54,167
We did what...

1286
01:59:54,968 --> 01:59:58,134
..we thought was right
every single moment.

1287
02:00:00,056 --> 02:00:02,512
Sometimes we were headstrong...

1288
02:00:04,519 --> 02:00:09,679
..but we lived our lives
with passion and commitment.

1289
02:00:11,526 --> 02:00:13,649
We should be grateful for that.

1290
02:00:17,866 --> 02:00:18,945
Viviane...

1291
02:00:20,785 --> 02:00:24,653
..find some happiness.

1292
02:00:26,624 --> 02:00:32,248
Just a small moment of happiness...

1293
02:00:33,757 --> 02:00:37,208
..that belongs only to you.

1294
02:00:41,431 --> 02:00:43,756
I think the Goddess...

1295
02:00:46,269 --> 02:00:50,053
..lives in our humanity...

1296
02:00:51,149 --> 02:00:54,483
..and not anywhere else.

1297
02:02:44,554 --> 02:02:46,262
Strange as it may seem...

1298
02:02:46,348 --> 02:02:50,262
..in marrying King Uriens and
moving with him to Wales...

1299
02:02:50,352 --> 02:02:54,563
..I won my self some of the few years
of happiness my life was to bring me.

1300
02:02:55,690 --> 02:02:57,766
When Accolon came to be with us...

1301
02:02:57,859 --> 02:03:00,813
..it seemed for a while
as if we were a family.

1302
02:03:07,452 --> 02:03:10,951
But far to the north,
under the tutelage of Morgause...

1303
02:03:11,373 --> 02:03:13,994
..my son Mordred was growing to manhood.

1304
02:03:14,084 --> 02:03:16,753
A manhood that would destroy us all.

1305
02:03:23,885 --> 02:03:25,593
Stay the horses!

1306
02:03:25,720 --> 02:03:27,263
What is it,
my lord?

1307
02:03:34,438 --> 02:03:37,059
Lucius, take these men back to Orkney.

1308
02:03:38,275 --> 02:03:40,944
Take not this road,
but the one that follows the river.

1309
02:03:41,027 --> 02:03:43,150
- I will see you this night.
- Yes, my lord.

1310
02:03:43,238 --> 02:03:44,353
Follow me.

1311
02:04:05,218 --> 02:04:06,132
Viviane.

1312
02:04:06,219 --> 02:04:08,591
- You know me, then.
- Of course.

1313
02:04:09,681 --> 02:04:12,219
I welcome you to Lothian,
Lady of the Lake.

1314
02:04:13,769 --> 02:04:16,094
You act as if you've been expecting me.

1315
02:04:16,605 --> 02:04:19,178
I could feel you long
before I could see you.

1316
02:04:19,775 --> 02:04:21,518
You have a plan for me,
I think.

1317
02:04:21,610 --> 02:04:23,982
I come in the cause of
the Goddess, Mordred.

1318
02:04:24,071 --> 02:04:25,613
She needs a champion.

1319
02:04:25,947 --> 02:04:28,617
And the question is,
will you be that champion?

1320
02:04:29,117 --> 02:04:31,406
You already have one.
His name is Arthur.

1321
02:04:31,870 --> 02:04:34,028
Avalon can no longer rely on Arthur.

1322
02:04:34,790 --> 02:04:38,289
He's dismantled our presence at Camelot,
and he has no heir.

1323
02:04:40,128 --> 02:04:41,955
Will you be that heir?

1324
02:04:42,881 --> 02:04:45,289
Why should anyone acknowledge me...

1325
02:04:45,384 --> 02:04:47,175
..as the High King's heir?

1326
02:04:47,344 --> 02:04:49,301
Because you are his son.

1327
02:04:50,347 --> 02:04:51,675
His son?

1328
02:05:00,941 --> 02:05:02,815
But my mother is his sister.

1329
02:05:03,652 --> 02:05:06,772
The blood of two parents from
the same powerful line...

1330
02:05:06,947 --> 02:05:10,232
..rich in magic,
run through you, Mordred.

1331
02:05:10,325 --> 02:05:13,825
You have the power, too,
and you know it.

1332
02:05:14,162 --> 02:05:17,662
His son.
Arthur's son.

1333
02:05:19,501 --> 02:05:21,328
By his own sister.

1334
02:05:24,047 --> 02:05:27,333
Yes, I have the power.

1335
02:05:28,385 --> 02:05:30,128
I have always known that.

1336
02:05:30,429 --> 02:05:32,302
I can bend men to my will.

1337
02:05:33,056 --> 02:05:36,556
I am placing the future of this
land in your hands, Mordred.

1338
02:05:37,769 --> 02:05:41,352
Will you rise to it,
or remain here...

1339
02:05:42,357 --> 02:05:44,397
..powerless in the Scottish wilderness?

1340
02:05:45,485 --> 02:05:47,145
You made me, Aunt...

1341
02:05:47,696 --> 02:05:50,613
..as surely as if you had
fashioned me out of clay.

1342
02:05:51,241 --> 02:05:53,400
What do you think my answer will be?

1343
02:06:04,004 --> 02:06:06,210
Leave me.
Leave!

1344
02:06:13,555 --> 02:06:15,263
Why didn't you tell me?

1345
02:06:17,017 --> 02:06:18,926
She's come to you,
hasn't she?

1346
02:06:19,186 --> 02:06:20,894
Why didn't you tell me...

1347
02:06:21,104 --> 02:06:22,647
..who my father is?

1348
02:06:23,232 --> 02:06:25,141
I was waiting until you were ready.

1349
02:06:25,609 --> 02:06:28,147
I'm ready.
Viviane believes I am ready.

1350
02:06:28,237 --> 02:06:31,191
Viviane!
Don't you see how ruthless she is?

1351
02:06:31,406 --> 02:06:33,814
Breeding you out of her
own niece and nephew?

1352
02:06:33,909 --> 02:06:37,492
Looking 20 years ahead to a time
when she might have use for you.

1353
02:06:39,164 --> 02:06:40,540
But in return...

1354
02:06:40,999 --> 02:06:44,249
..she is placing the reins
of power in my hands.

1355
02:06:44,336 --> 02:06:46,329
Not she alone, Mordred.

1356
02:06:48,715 --> 02:06:49,581
It was I...

1357
02:06:49,758 --> 02:06:53,507
..who ensured that Arthur and
Guinevere have no son of their own.

1358
02:06:55,305 --> 02:06:57,428
It was I who cursed her womb.

1359
02:07:04,106 --> 02:07:06,312
So you'd like to see me
on the High Throne...

1360
02:07:08,819 --> 02:07:11,274
..with you as High Queen Mother?

1361
02:07:12,614 --> 02:07:13,610
Yes.

1362
02:07:15,117 --> 02:07:17,109
But nothing can be done now.

1363
02:07:17,578 --> 02:07:19,701
Arthur's flame has
never burned brighter.

1364
02:07:19,788 --> 02:07:23,656
Anyone who raises a hand
against him will be torn to
pieces by his companions.

1365
02:07:24,209 --> 02:07:26,451
You think I cannot defeat him directly?

1366
02:07:26,587 --> 02:07:29,042
But if you win power that way,
it will not last.

1367
02:07:34,344 --> 02:07:35,459
Listen to wisdom.

1368
02:07:35,929 --> 02:07:39,429
Your enemy is that the king is so loved.

1369
02:07:40,225 --> 02:07:44,353
So, Britain's love of her king
must be made somehow less.

1370
02:07:44,646 --> 02:07:45,726
How?

1371
02:07:46,231 --> 02:07:47,809
He must be discredited.

1372
02:07:50,486 --> 02:07:52,478
No man is without flaws.

1373
02:07:54,031 --> 02:07:57,649
With the king,
it concerns his queen.

1374
02:08:01,330 --> 02:08:04,829
I do not like to think
that this great king...

1375
02:08:06,251 --> 02:08:09,834
..this great man,
my father...

1376
02:08:11,006 --> 02:08:12,381
..is my enemy.

1377
02:08:13,675 --> 02:08:15,585
And that for the sake of Avalon...

1378
02:08:15,677 --> 02:08:18,465
..I must bring him down to nothing.

1379
02:08:20,766 --> 02:08:24,811
I would rather love him as all men do.

1380
02:08:27,690 --> 02:08:29,848
I would like to look on my mother...

1381
02:08:31,026 --> 02:08:34,027
..Lady Morgaine.
I would like to look on her...

1382
02:08:34,363 --> 02:08:37,032
..who bore me as my mother...

1383
02:08:39,243 --> 02:08:42,861
..not as the priestess,
or the Goddess.

1384
02:08:45,249 --> 02:08:48,166
I am so weary of gods and goddesses.

1385
02:08:50,045 --> 02:08:51,872
I am weary of my fate.

1386
02:08:57,553 --> 02:08:59,427
Who was yonder old Roman...

1387
02:09:00,514 --> 02:09:03,301
..who said,
"Call no man happy until he is dead"?

1388
02:09:07,688 --> 02:09:08,968
My task then...

1389
02:09:09,064 --> 02:09:14,059
..is to bring that greatest of
all happinesses to my father.

1390
02:09:24,580 --> 02:09:26,122
You will be drunk,
dear one.

1391
02:09:26,248 --> 02:09:27,956
So I will be drunk.

1392
02:09:28,083 --> 02:09:29,328
So let it be.

1393
02:09:32,546 --> 02:09:35,630
I drink to death and dishonour.

1394
02:09:51,440 --> 02:09:53,729
"And the Lord God said unto Abraham:

1395
02:09:53,943 --> 02:09:58,605
"Lo, thou art in thy ninetieth year,
yet I will grant thee a son...

1396
02:09:59,490 --> 02:10:01,862
.."and from his loins
shall spring a people...

1397
02:10:01,951 --> 02:10:05,117
.."as numerous as the
stars in the firmament...

1398
02:10:05,829 --> 02:10:08,285
.."and they shall inherit the earth".

1399
02:10:41,282 --> 02:10:44,069
Forgive me, my lord, I
came without announcement.

1400
02:10:46,412 --> 02:10:48,239
Mordred of Lothian.

1401
02:10:48,330 --> 02:10:49,955
I pray only to serve you, sir.

1402
02:10:50,166 --> 02:10:52,123
I've heard of your deeds, lad.

1403
02:10:52,209 --> 02:10:55,329
You've routed Saxon troops
who outnumbered you 7-to-1.

1404
02:10:55,421 --> 02:10:58,872
I have been questioning those Saxons
who fall into my hands, my lord.

1405
02:10:58,966 --> 02:11:01,753
And I believe they are
planning an invasion.

1406
02:11:02,845 --> 02:11:04,921
But they've been peaceful for 10 years.

1407
02:11:05,181 --> 02:11:08,347
They've spent that time building ships.
Hundreds of ships...

1408
02:11:09,018 --> 02:11:12,885
..and if I know the Saxon mind,
this time it won't be petty skirmishes.

1409
02:11:12,980 --> 02:11:15,601
They will take this country
from shore to shore.

1410
02:11:15,691 --> 02:11:18,265
- How could this be?
- It could be true, sir.

1411
02:11:18,360 --> 02:11:20,733
Saxons have never been as quiet as this.

1412
02:11:20,863 --> 02:11:22,571
I beg of you, sir...

1413
02:11:23,199 --> 02:11:25,524
..grant me the order of knighthood.

1414
02:11:26,327 --> 02:11:28,450
Let me bring my knowledge to your army.

1415
02:11:28,537 --> 02:11:30,744
With my tactics,
we will destroy them.

1416
02:11:30,831 --> 02:11:32,207
On my honour.

1417
02:11:40,549 --> 02:11:41,664
My lords...

1418
02:11:41,884 --> 02:11:45,549
..I heard always that a champion's
duty is to meet with all comers.

1419
02:11:47,223 --> 02:11:50,426
Now I have cause to
chastise this impudence.

1420
02:12:33,602 --> 02:12:35,642
Where did you learn to fight like this?

1421
02:12:36,022 --> 02:12:38,098
Are you the son of one of my men?

1422
02:12:38,357 --> 02:12:40,184
Not of one of your men, sir.

1423
02:12:41,652 --> 02:12:44,024
My father was gone long
before I could know him.

1424
02:12:44,447 --> 02:12:46,107
But if you find me familiar...

1425
02:12:46,574 --> 02:12:48,946
..perhaps it is my mother
you see in my face.

1426
02:12:49,785 --> 02:12:51,030
She is your sister...

1427
02:12:51,996 --> 02:12:53,538
..the Lady Morgaine.

1428
02:12:54,665 --> 02:13:00,086
Morgaine's son.
I don't believe it.

1429
02:13:00,796 --> 02:13:02,789
She would have spoken of him.

1430
02:13:03,507 --> 02:13:05,547
She would have,
my good lady...

1431
02:13:06,052 --> 02:13:08,887
..but that I believe there
was some sadness in my making.

1432
02:13:09,597 --> 02:13:11,056
I was raised at Orkney...

1433
02:13:11,557 --> 02:13:12,932
..by my Aunt Morgause.

1434
02:13:15,645 --> 02:13:19,144
Yet you have that regal
air possessed of Morgaine.

1435
02:13:19,649 --> 02:13:23,729
Who but the son of my sister would
have marched in here like that?

1436
02:13:24,153 --> 02:13:28,021
I can see by your face beyond doubt,
that you are hers.

1437
02:13:29,492 --> 02:13:32,825
Welcome to my court, lad,
and to my table.

1438
02:13:41,587 --> 02:13:43,746
Sit with me and tell me everything.

1439
02:13:43,839 --> 02:13:46,627
We shall stay up till morning
getting to know each other.

1440
02:13:46,717 --> 02:13:49,469
Men, welcome my nephew.

1441
02:13:50,137 --> 02:13:51,513
He is one of us.

1442
02:14:00,815 --> 02:14:02,854
When King Uriens died...

1443
02:14:03,359 --> 02:14:05,731
..I could not stop thinking of Avalon.

1444
02:14:09,448 --> 02:14:11,940
I knew that one phase
of my life was over...

1445
02:14:12,243 --> 02:14:14,781
..and a new one was about to begin.

1446
02:14:15,997 --> 02:14:18,452
And much though I still loved Accolon...

1447
02:14:18,583 --> 02:14:21,500
..I knew, too,
he could not be a part of it.

1448
02:14:23,087 --> 02:14:24,118
Morgaine.

1449
02:14:25,673 --> 02:14:27,915
This was your father's favourite view.

1450
02:14:31,929 --> 02:14:33,471
I'll be leaving soon.

1451
02:14:36,517 --> 02:14:37,798
You could stay.

1452
02:14:40,938 --> 02:14:42,053
Thank you.

1453
02:14:45,693 --> 02:14:48,314
But every time I look at you,
I'll see him.

1454
02:14:50,948 --> 02:14:52,407
Where will you go?

1455
02:14:56,871 --> 02:14:58,614
I must go back to Avalon.

1456
02:15:08,466 --> 02:15:11,633
But if I thought the Mother Goddess
would make it easy for me...

1457
02:15:11,719 --> 02:15:13,878
..to come to terms with Viviane...

1458
02:15:14,138 --> 02:15:15,419
..I was wrong.

1459
02:16:00,977 --> 02:16:02,436
The Saxons are upon us.

1460
02:16:07,108 --> 02:16:08,306
Fight!

1461
02:18:06,019 --> 02:18:10,063
My men tell me the invasion will come
before the next full moon, my lord.

1462
02:18:10,732 --> 02:18:12,440
We are ready for them.

1463
02:18:13,276 --> 02:18:14,770
Except in one respect.

1464
02:18:14,861 --> 02:18:16,355
And that is?

1465
02:18:16,446 --> 02:18:19,198
If you were to die in battle, sir.

1466
02:18:23,578 --> 02:18:25,286
Well, you would fight on.

1467
02:18:25,455 --> 02:18:26,949
Lancelot would fight on.

1468
02:18:27,040 --> 02:18:29,495
All my brave companions would fight on.

1469
02:18:30,460 --> 02:18:33,165
And which of them would
become High King, sire?

1470
02:18:34,255 --> 02:18:36,082
You have no designated successor.

1471
02:18:36,174 --> 02:18:39,958
I cannot designate a successor when
my queen might yet bear me an heir.

1472
02:18:43,890 --> 02:18:45,930
It is a hope she clings to.

1473
02:18:46,768 --> 02:18:48,642
I will not rob her of that.

1474
02:18:48,853 --> 02:18:50,976
Whatever the cost to your kingdom?

1475
02:18:51,856 --> 02:18:54,264
If I choose someone not
of my own descent...

1476
02:18:54,484 --> 02:18:56,144
..it will split the companions.

1477
02:18:56,236 --> 02:18:59,190
There will be war between us
and the Saxons would prevail.

1478
02:18:59,906 --> 02:19:02,148
Then choose someone of
your own descent, sir.

1479
02:19:05,578 --> 02:19:07,156
I am your son.

1480
02:19:12,919 --> 02:19:16,502
I am your son.

1481
02:19:22,637 --> 02:19:24,844
But Morgaine is your mother.

1482
02:19:26,141 --> 02:19:30,304
It was she that you slept
with in the great marriage.

1483
02:19:32,188 --> 02:19:34,430
She was the virgin huntress.

1484
02:19:37,027 --> 02:19:38,984
You coupled with her...

1485
02:19:39,738 --> 02:19:42,193
..and together you conceived a child.

1486
02:19:43,825 --> 02:19:46,612
I am that child,
come now to demand...

1487
02:19:46,703 --> 02:19:48,945
..that which is my due!

1488
02:19:50,165 --> 02:19:54,209
No, it's not true.
It's not true.

1489
02:19:55,211 --> 02:19:58,378
You're lying to force Arthur to
promote you beyond your merits.

1490
02:19:59,633 --> 02:20:02,384
Arthur, tell him it's not true.

1491
02:20:02,594 --> 02:20:03,922
Tell him you never...

1492
02:20:07,140 --> 02:20:08,515
You never...

1493
02:20:12,896 --> 02:20:14,438
He cannot tell you...

1494
02:20:14,940 --> 02:20:19,317
..because he knows what I say is true.

1495
02:20:25,033 --> 02:20:28,734
Then all this time when I
could not give you a child...

1496
02:21:14,207 --> 02:21:15,785
Mordred is his son.

1497
02:21:18,837 --> 02:21:20,212
For many years...

1498
02:21:21,381 --> 02:21:23,457
..I gave myself to my husband...

1499
02:21:24,634 --> 02:21:26,508
..in the name of our Lord.

1500
02:21:27,304 --> 02:21:32,642
For many years,
we prayed to fashion life within me.

1501
02:21:36,146 --> 02:21:38,981
But it seems that God has
not heard those prayers.

1502
02:21:45,739 --> 02:21:47,281
Perhaps He has heard...

1503
02:21:50,827 --> 02:21:52,321
..but did not will it.

1504
02:21:53,663 --> 02:21:55,573
But what did He will instead?

1505
02:21:58,210 --> 02:21:59,918
That a bastard child...

1506
02:22:00,879 --> 02:22:03,335
..sprung from an incestuous bed...

1507
02:22:04,090 --> 02:22:07,590
..should triumph over
our tireless devotion.

1508
02:22:09,638 --> 02:22:12,804
They say His ways are unknowable.

1509
02:22:14,768 --> 02:22:15,847
Of course.

1510
02:22:17,896 --> 02:22:20,767
I am too small to
understand the will of God.

1511
02:22:23,026 --> 02:22:24,271
Do you think...

1512
02:22:25,695 --> 02:22:28,981
..I'm being punished for
the night we spent together?

1513
02:22:31,868 --> 02:22:35,154
I don't think it's God who punishes us.

1514
02:22:37,541 --> 02:22:39,367
I think we punish ourselves.

1515
02:22:43,714 --> 02:22:46,039
Would it not be a comfort to believe...

1516
02:22:46,633 --> 02:22:48,175
..just for a time...

1517
02:22:49,010 --> 02:22:53,222
..that we create our own
heavens and our own hells?

1518
02:23:00,897 --> 02:23:02,522
It would be a comfort.

1519
02:23:06,570 --> 02:23:08,064
It would, Lancelot.

1520
02:23:08,572 --> 02:23:12,154
Maybe God does not grant you all
the comforts you ask of Him...

1521
02:23:13,410 --> 02:23:16,197
..but offers you others
which you refuse to see.

1522
02:23:18,915 --> 02:23:22,664
Maybe you should find the
comforts He does offer you...

1523
02:23:23,337 --> 02:23:26,919
..my dear lady,
and accept them.

1524
02:24:30,153 --> 02:24:34,483
Wounded and weary, at last I
arrived at the borders of Avalon.

1525
02:24:38,161 --> 02:24:40,450
I felt somehow I had never left.

1526
02:25:23,540 --> 02:25:25,332
But then I realized...

1527
02:25:25,417 --> 02:25:28,453
..the power I once prevailed
over had left me...

1528
02:25:28,545 --> 02:25:30,585
..a long time ago.

1529
02:25:31,799 --> 02:25:33,875
I was stranded on the outside...

1530
02:25:34,384 --> 02:25:36,176
..like a child locked out.

1531
02:25:37,387 --> 02:25:39,095
Viviane had forsaken me.

1532
02:25:48,524 --> 02:25:52,023
Then I heard a sound I
had not heard for years:

1533
02:25:52,778 --> 02:25:54,569
The bell of Glastonbury.

1534
02:26:37,072 --> 02:26:38,270
My daughter!

1535
02:26:56,717 --> 02:26:59,042
Where have you been,
my child?

1536
02:26:59,136 --> 02:27:01,093
I've had such sadness.

1537
02:27:14,193 --> 02:27:15,189
Come.

1538
02:28:03,367 --> 02:28:04,945
Lancelot?

1539
02:28:08,956 --> 02:28:10,284
Wrong.

1540
02:28:37,568 --> 02:28:38,813
Run!

1541
02:28:49,079 --> 02:28:50,194
Mordred...

1542
02:28:50,414 --> 02:28:52,241
..such a trick is worthy of you.

1543
02:28:52,333 --> 02:28:56,033
In the king's name, Lancelot,
I accuse you of high treason.

1544
02:28:56,754 --> 02:29:01,083
Gawain, in God's name,
how could you lend yourself to this?

1545
02:29:01,258 --> 02:29:02,836
I never believed it of you.

1546
02:29:03,594 --> 02:29:07,093
I were to God I had fallen in
battle before ever I saw this day.

1547
02:29:08,098 --> 02:29:09,343
Dress yourself.

1548
02:29:09,433 --> 02:29:12,600
I will not take you so disgraced
into Arthur's presence.

1549
02:29:13,062 --> 02:29:15,304
Enough men have witnessed your shame.

1550
02:29:19,610 --> 02:29:22,813
I'm glad for your sake that
you would come with us quietly.

1551
02:29:23,614 --> 02:29:24,610
Mother?

1552
02:29:34,208 --> 02:29:35,536
See to the queen.

1553
02:29:35,835 --> 02:29:38,789
She'll be in your hands
until Arthur deals with her.

1554
02:29:40,756 --> 02:29:43,081
Come along,
my lady.
Get into your gown.

1555
02:29:43,175 --> 02:29:46,675
You do not want to go shameless
before the king, do you?

1556
02:29:46,971 --> 02:29:48,798
Get me your sword, Lancelot.

1557
02:30:11,912 --> 02:30:12,944
Come.

1558
02:30:15,708 --> 02:30:16,822
Stop!

1559
02:30:17,001 --> 02:30:18,199
Let them go.

1560
02:30:18,669 --> 02:30:20,876
It is for the king to
decide their fate now.

1561
02:30:26,302 --> 02:30:28,840
No man in all of Britain
will hide them now.

1562
02:30:45,279 --> 02:30:46,821
They have defied you.

1563
02:30:47,114 --> 02:30:49,273
He has slain one of your most loyal men.

1564
02:30:49,367 --> 02:30:52,367
I love them both.
I will not hunt after them.

1565
02:30:54,830 --> 02:30:56,028
I beg you,
my lord.

1566
02:30:56,165 --> 02:30:58,621
Lancelot has committed treason.

1567
02:30:58,709 --> 02:31:02,956
Treason against the Crown,
to which I have sworn allegiance,
sworn with my life!

1568
02:31:03,047 --> 02:31:05,419
Lancelot and Guinevere are a part of me.

1569
02:31:06,384 --> 02:31:09,503
Do not ask me to tear into my own flesh.

1570
02:31:09,971 --> 02:31:11,595
If you do nothing, Father...

1571
02:31:11,681 --> 02:31:15,263
..you will lose the confidence
of your army and your men.

1572
02:31:15,893 --> 02:31:18,431
You will cease to be High
King in anything but name.

1573
02:31:20,731 --> 02:31:22,771
I have not the heart for it.

1574
02:31:25,444 --> 02:31:28,232
I have no choice but to
leave this in your hands.

1575
02:31:45,590 --> 02:31:48,460
I cannot bear to say goodbye
to you here, my lady.

1576
02:31:50,136 --> 02:31:54,928
I am no longer any man's wife,
or lover.

1577
02:31:59,770 --> 02:32:02,937
From this point on,
I give my heart to no one except God.

1578
02:32:06,360 --> 02:32:07,771
I've lost my king.

1579
02:32:08,946 --> 02:32:11,484
I've lost my honour,
and now...

1580
02:32:27,173 --> 02:32:29,296
That day I saw you on the stones.

1581
02:32:31,469 --> 02:32:33,212
That bell was also ringing.

1582
02:32:35,848 --> 02:32:37,093
Remember?

1583
02:32:39,810 --> 02:32:41,470
How could I forget?

1584
02:32:44,273 --> 02:32:46,147
So innocent we were.

1585
02:33:15,429 --> 02:33:16,544
I pray...

1586
02:33:17,473 --> 02:33:19,098
..there is a heaven...

1587
02:33:20,518 --> 02:33:22,890
..and that you would
be an angel in it...

1588
02:33:22,979 --> 02:33:27,023
..so when I die,
we can be together at last.

1589
02:34:08,149 --> 02:34:09,892
I knew you'd come.

1590
02:34:17,116 --> 02:34:21,066
Mother Superior,
I come seeking forgiveness.

1591
02:34:21,954 --> 02:34:24,991
And this is the place
where you shall find it.

1592
02:34:28,961 --> 02:34:32,128
Suffering brings women to God.

1593
02:35:13,172 --> 02:35:14,880
When you left Camelot...

1594
02:35:16,050 --> 02:35:17,794
..Arthur missed you so.

1595
02:35:19,345 --> 02:35:21,836
I have often thought my greatest sin...

1596
02:35:22,015 --> 02:35:25,715
..was coming between the love that
you and Arthur have for each other.

1597
02:35:26,686 --> 02:35:28,310
How is my dear brother?

1598
02:35:29,397 --> 02:35:30,975
He is in great danger.

1599
02:35:31,566 --> 02:35:33,190
He has need of you now.

1600
02:35:33,526 --> 02:35:36,397
Why?
What's happened?

1601
02:35:37,113 --> 02:35:40,482
It is your son, Mordred.

1602
02:35:52,003 --> 02:35:53,628
As I raced back to Camelot...

1603
02:35:53,713 --> 02:35:56,334
..to be with my brother
in his hour of need...

1604
02:35:56,466 --> 02:35:59,171
..I saw people fleeing from the coasts.

1605
02:36:11,689 --> 02:36:14,975
The final assault of the
Saxons had at last begun.

1606
02:36:19,823 --> 02:36:22,693
It was at that moment that
I finally encountered...

1607
02:36:23,117 --> 02:36:25,194
..the one person I had given up hope...

1608
02:36:25,286 --> 02:36:26,946
..of ever seeing again.

1609
02:36:41,052 --> 02:36:43,128
I was behind you much of the way.

1610
02:36:46,391 --> 02:36:48,964
I was proud and unforgiving.

1611
02:36:51,062 --> 02:36:53,221
I may have turned my back on you...

1612
02:36:53,523 --> 02:36:56,192
..but my heart never turned.

1613
02:37:01,906 --> 02:37:05,571
I destroyed something between
us in the name of the Goddess.

1614
02:37:07,704 --> 02:37:11,203
Now I fear I have destroyed
something else in her name.

1615
02:37:12,584 --> 02:37:16,581
Will Camelot and Avalon
disappear into the mists?

1616
02:37:21,134 --> 02:37:23,755
I see a land that runs red with blood...

1617
02:37:24,345 --> 02:37:25,756
..where chaos rules.

1618
02:37:30,018 --> 02:37:31,761
It is the end of an age.

1619
02:37:40,612 --> 02:37:45,072
I thought that I knew what to expect
when Viviane and I reached Camelot.

1620
02:37:45,742 --> 02:37:48,778
But it was beyond anything
either of us had imagined.

1621
02:38:15,146 --> 02:38:17,720
I am Morgaine,
sister to the king.

1622
02:38:18,984 --> 02:38:20,691
Where is my brother?

1623
02:38:22,529 --> 02:38:24,521
Where is Arthur Pendragon?

1624
02:38:37,669 --> 02:38:38,665
Mother.

1625
02:38:41,339 --> 02:38:42,502
What a surprise.

1626
02:38:52,517 --> 02:38:56,349
So you came to see Arthur and not me?

1627
02:38:58,523 --> 02:39:00,231
You came to see your brother...

1628
02:39:00,817 --> 02:39:03,273
..and not the son you bore him.

1629
02:39:16,207 --> 02:39:18,366
Welcome to the new Camelot.

1630
02:39:19,377 --> 02:39:21,169
This is an abomination.

1631
02:39:22,631 --> 02:39:24,291
I thought you would be proud.

1632
02:39:24,549 --> 02:39:26,838
We are keeping the ways
of the Goddess alive.

1633
02:39:27,260 --> 02:39:29,467
These are not the ways of the Goddess.

1634
02:39:29,554 --> 02:39:31,713
You think you know her
ways better than I?

1635
02:39:32,724 --> 02:39:35,725
You always got it all,
while I was left with nothing.

1636
02:39:36,895 --> 02:39:39,018
But someone was watching out for me...

1637
02:39:40,398 --> 02:39:42,521
..and what god it is I care not.

1638
02:39:45,111 --> 02:39:46,855
The tribesmen only follow you...

1639
02:39:46,947 --> 02:39:50,565
..because you have the Pendragon
banner hanging over their heads.

1640
02:39:57,332 --> 02:39:59,538
I am the Lady of the Lake.

1641
02:40:02,587 --> 02:40:05,209
I am the High Priestess of Avalon...

1642
02:40:09,594 --> 02:40:12,132
..and I declare she
has been deceiving you.

1643
02:40:16,935 --> 02:40:18,346
This is not Avalon.

1644
02:40:20,814 --> 02:40:23,483
This is not the will
of the Goddess I serve.

1645
02:40:25,026 --> 02:40:26,569
This is her will...

1646
02:40:29,489 --> 02:40:32,063
..and it is murder and perversion.

1647
02:40:33,952 --> 02:40:36,110
My sister is an evil sorceress...

1648
02:40:36,621 --> 02:40:38,910
..intent on destroying
all that is Camelot.

1649
02:43:23,622 --> 02:43:26,576
Now, bring me to the king!

1650
02:43:34,633 --> 02:43:35,831
Is it you?

1651
02:43:39,429 --> 02:43:41,137
Is it really you?

1652
02:43:50,983 --> 02:43:52,643
You've come back to me.

1653
02:43:59,408 --> 02:44:04,070
My sister,
why did you not tell me about our child?

1654
02:44:05,581 --> 02:44:08,250
Why did you bear the burden all alone?

1655
02:44:08,834 --> 02:44:12,666
The pain of it would have been no
less for me had I shared it with you.

1656
02:44:14,631 --> 02:44:16,375
You always looked after me.

1657
02:44:16,592 --> 02:44:20,340
I've done my duty,
and now you must do yours.

1658
02:44:21,889 --> 02:44:23,846
What duty remains for me to do?

1659
02:44:23,974 --> 02:44:27,723
You must protect your land
against the Saxon invasion...

1660
02:44:27,811 --> 02:44:30,302
..the likes of which
I've never seen before.

1661
02:44:31,732 --> 02:44:34,104
I'm a sinner and I'm weak.

1662
02:44:34,193 --> 02:44:35,901
We have both sinned.

1663
02:44:36,403 --> 02:44:40,235
Are we going to let those sins drag us
down, as some priests would have it...

1664
02:44:40,365 --> 02:44:43,532
..and send us crawling on our
knees begging forgiveness...

1665
02:44:43,619 --> 02:44:47,913
..or are we going to rise above them and
do what we were put on this earth to do?

1666
02:44:49,416 --> 02:44:51,409
What were we put on this earth to do?

1667
02:44:51,710 --> 02:44:55,209
You were put on this earth
to lead your people, Arthur.

1668
02:44:55,381 --> 02:44:56,376
Stand!

1669
02:44:56,632 --> 02:45:00,250
The Saxon invasion has begun.
They have lined our shores.

1670
02:45:00,386 --> 02:45:02,046
They will take down Camelot.

1671
02:45:02,221 --> 02:45:06,135
You must ride out now, even if it's
the last battle you ever fight.

1672
02:45:06,225 --> 02:45:09,261
You must bring one last
note of glory to Avalon.

1673
02:45:31,625 --> 02:45:34,626
And so Arthur and the
remnants of the Round Table...

1674
02:45:35,421 --> 02:45:37,579
..rode out for their last battle.

1675
02:47:45,217 --> 02:47:47,210
We will fight as we always did.

1676
02:47:49,430 --> 02:47:51,672
As we always did,
my friend.

1677
02:48:35,267 --> 02:48:36,927
He's joined the Saxons.

1678
02:48:41,148 --> 02:48:42,773
Our Father in heaven...

1679
02:48:43,692 --> 02:48:45,934
..and our Mother of the earth...

1680
02:48:46,612 --> 02:48:48,735
..soon I shall be taken into Your house.

1681
02:48:52,118 --> 02:48:54,490
Let me be fit to wear Your robes.

1682
02:48:54,787 --> 02:48:57,360
Let the sword that I die by cleanse me.

1683
02:49:01,293 --> 02:49:04,544
And if there is honour in the
course you have set for me...

1684
02:49:05,256 --> 02:49:06,964
..let me earn it today.

1685
02:52:23,496 --> 02:52:25,038
Mordred!

1686
02:52:30,878 --> 02:52:31,660
Father.

1687
02:52:44,976 --> 02:52:47,348
The Goddess holds everything in balance.

1688
02:52:47,645 --> 02:52:51,513
Without her,
destruction and chaos will prevail.

1689
02:52:53,192 --> 02:52:54,603
Bring me my horse.

1690
02:53:44,953 --> 02:53:46,613
Why have you become my enemy?

1691
02:53:48,748 --> 02:53:52,164
You truly believe that I was
ever anything else, my father?

1692
02:55:37,482 --> 02:55:38,762
Mother.

1693
02:56:32,245 --> 02:56:34,202
Lancelot.

1694
02:56:37,292 --> 02:56:39,166
Take me home, Sister.

1695
02:56:42,172 --> 02:56:43,582
Take me to Avalon.

1696
02:56:59,814 --> 02:57:02,352
Though Avalon had already rejected me...

1697
02:57:03,068 --> 02:57:04,941
..I felt its strange power...

1698
02:57:05,028 --> 02:57:08,728
..as it drew the dying king and
I back towards its sacred shores.

1699
02:57:10,450 --> 02:57:13,155
I began to doubt we
would ever reach Avalon.

1700
02:57:13,620 --> 02:57:15,363
Perhaps, for our disobedience...

1701
02:57:15,455 --> 02:57:17,946
..we would be lost in this
limbo of mist forever.

1702
02:57:19,334 --> 02:57:21,576
Or perhaps,
with Viviane's death...

1703
02:57:22,337 --> 02:57:24,413
..it had simply disappeared.

1704
02:58:18,518 --> 02:58:20,843
Are we shut out of Avalon, Sister?

1705
02:58:23,148 --> 02:58:25,853
I fear the Goddess has
rejected us, Arthur...

1706
02:58:26,943 --> 02:58:28,651
..as we rejected her.

1707
02:58:30,447 --> 02:58:32,356
Perhaps she needs an offering.

1708
02:58:48,298 --> 02:58:50,338
Give it back to the Goddess, Morgaine.

1709
02:58:52,886 --> 02:58:54,713
It belongs to her now.

1710
02:59:43,937 --> 02:59:45,479
We are home, Arthur.

1711
03:00:04,666 --> 03:00:06,160
My little brother...

1712
03:00:09,212 --> 03:00:10,327
..my love.

1713
03:00:13,467 --> 03:00:14,712
We're home.

1714
03:00:47,000 --> 03:00:49,408
Avalon faded from the world of men...

1715
03:00:49,586 --> 03:00:53,085
..and only Glastonbury marked
where its wonders had been.

1716
03:00:55,968 --> 03:00:58,968
The Saxons overran Britain
and made it their own...

1717
03:00:59,262 --> 03:01:01,302
..and the Goddess was forgotten.

1718
03:01:02,182 --> 03:01:05,100
Or so I was convinced for many years.

1719
03:01:22,536 --> 03:01:23,781
Virgin Mary...

1720
03:01:24,037 --> 03:01:26,707
..Mother of God,
pray for me.

1721
03:01:32,129 --> 03:01:36,173
Until at last I realized
the Goddess had survived.

1722
03:01:37,050 --> 03:01:39,008
She had not been destroyed...

1723
03:01:39,094 --> 03:01:41,881
..but had simply adopted
another incarnation.

1724
03:01:42,890 --> 03:01:44,882
And perhaps,
one day...

1725
03:01:45,142 --> 03:01:48,392
..future generations will
be able to bring her back...

1726
03:01:48,520 --> 03:01:50,145
..as we knew her...

1727
03:01:50,397 --> 03:01:52,390
..in the glory of Avalon.

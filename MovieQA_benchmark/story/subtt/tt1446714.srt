1
00:02:35,381 --> 00:02:59,638


2
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:32,059
Get Charlie.

3
00:05:43,195 --> 00:05:44,864
Dr. Holloway!

4
00:05:47,742 --> 00:05:49,077
Charlie!

5
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:58,711
What?

6
00:05:59,462 --> 00:06:01,297
Come quick!

7
00:06:31,119 --> 00:06:33,329
-Did you date it?
-Thirty-five thousand...

8
00:06:33,496 --> 00:06:35,539
...years. Maybe older.

9
00:06:59,271 --> 00:07:01,648
You gotta be kidding me.

10
00:07:04,527 --> 00:07:06,278
It's the same configuration.

11
00:07:08,071 --> 00:07:11,367
I mean, it's gotta predate
the others by millennia.

12
00:07:25,172 --> 00:07:27,424
I think they want us
to come and find them.

13
00:07:30,135 --> 00:07:31,220
Yeah.

14
00:08:37,161 --> 00:08:39,704
What happened to that man?

15
00:08:39,871 --> 00:08:40,956
He died.

16
00:08:42,415 --> 00:08:43,833
Why aren't you helping them?

17
00:08:45,127 --> 00:08:46,837
They don't want my help.

18
00:08:47,004 --> 00:08:48,547
Their God is different than ours.

19
00:08:50,882 --> 00:08:52,300
Why did he die?

20
00:08:53,217 --> 00:08:55,136
Because sooner or later, everyone does.

21
00:08:55,303 --> 00:08:56,554
Like Mummy?

22
00:08:58,557 --> 00:08:59,766
Like Mummy.

23
00:09:01,559 --> 00:09:03,186
Where do they go?

24
00:09:04,729 --> 00:09:06,814
Everyone has their own word.

25
00:09:07,106 --> 00:09:08,232
Heaven.

26
00:09:08,899 --> 00:09:09,733
Paradise.

27
00:09:11,569 --> 00:09:13,863
Whatever it's called,
it's someplace beautiful.

28
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:15,698
How do you know it's beautiful?

29
00:09:17,741 --> 00:09:19,244
That's what I choose to believe.

30
00:09:19,577 --> 00:09:21,204
What do you believe, Ellie?

31
00:09:55,572 --> 00:09:57,365
Good morning, David.

32
00:09:58,449 --> 00:09:59,909
Transmitting message.

33
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,914
No response.

34
00:10:14,674 --> 00:10:16,133
Whilst this articulation...

35
00:10:16,342 --> 00:10:19,054
...is attested in
the lndo-European descendants...

36
00:10:19,221 --> 00:10:21,097
...as a purely paralinguistic form...

37
00:10:21,264 --> 00:10:24,350
...it is phonemic in the ancestral form
dating back...

38
00:10:24,517 --> 00:10:26,477
...five millennia or more.

39
00:10:27,144 --> 00:10:28,646
Let's attempt Schleicher's fable.

40
00:10:29,146 --> 00:10:29,938
Repeat after me.

41
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:44,453
Perfect.

42
00:10:45,038 --> 00:10:47,332
-Mr. Lawrence?
-Yes?

43
00:10:47,874 --> 00:10:49,709
-Flimsy, sir.
-Thank you.

44
00:10:56,799 --> 00:10:59,427
You do that once too often.
It's only flesh and blood!

45
00:11:00,178 --> 00:11:02,680
Michael George Hartley,
you're a philosopher.

46
00:11:03,222 --> 00:11:04,515
And you're barmy.

47
00:11:09,978 --> 00:11:12,356
-lt damn well hurts!
-Certainly, it hurts.

48
00:11:13,482 --> 00:11:14,983
Well, what's the trick, then?

49
00:11:15,859 --> 00:11:18,945
The trick, William Potter,
is not minding that it hurts.

50
00:11:19,446 --> 00:11:22,699
The trick, William Potter...

51
00:11:22,865 --> 00:11:25,952
...is not minding that it hurts.

52
00:11:31,499 --> 00:11:34,503
The trick, William Potter...

53
00:11:35,087 --> 00:11:38,591
...is not minding that it hurts.

54
00:11:52,229 --> 00:11:53,855
Attention:

55
00:11:54,105 --> 00:11:55,482
Destination threshold.

56
00:11:55,899 --> 00:11:56,983
Attention:

57
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:59,153
Destination threshold.

58
00:11:59,611 --> 00:12:02,072
Attention: Destination threshold.

59
00:13:04,426 --> 00:13:05,469
Robe.

60
00:13:16,938 --> 00:13:18,231
How long?

61
00:13:18,523 --> 00:13:20,775
Two years, four months, 18 days...

62
00:13:20,942 --> 00:13:22,151
...36 hours, 15 minutes.

63
00:13:22,485 --> 00:13:23,736
Any casualties?

64
00:13:24,278 --> 00:13:25,405
Casualties, ma'am?

65
00:13:25,572 --> 00:13:26,614
Has anyone died?

66
00:13:27,198 --> 00:13:29,117
No, ma'am. Everyone is fine.

67
00:13:31,202 --> 00:13:32,786
Well, then wake them up.

68
00:13:44,047 --> 00:13:45,967
Try to relax, Dr. Shaw.

69
00:13:47,176 --> 00:13:48,761
My name is David.

70
00:13:50,179 --> 00:13:52,515
Your mind and body
are in a state of shock...

71
00:13:52,682 --> 00:13:54,767
...as a result of the stasis.

72
00:13:55,018 --> 00:13:56,894
It's all right. Perfectly normal.

73
00:13:57,103 --> 00:13:57,853
Ellie.

74
00:13:59,146 --> 00:14:00,522
We're here, baby.

75
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:05,695
There, there.

76
00:14:07,530 --> 00:14:09,740
Drink plenty of water.
Drink plenty of fluids.

77
00:14:11,283 --> 00:14:12,702
Hydration aids muscle mass.

78
00:14:17,873 --> 00:14:20,960
All crew, consume shakes
with high caloric content.

79
00:14:27,216 --> 00:14:29,384
What the hell is that?

80
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:32,346
It's Christmas.

81
00:14:32,763 --> 00:14:33,889
We need the holidays...

82
00:14:34,056 --> 00:14:35,599
...to show time is still moving.

83
00:14:35,766 --> 00:14:36,684
Mission briefing...

84
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:38,393
...is about to start, captain.

85
00:14:38,895 --> 00:14:40,480
Might wanna make your way down.

86
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:43,065
Well, I haven't had any breakfast yet.

87
00:14:43,566 --> 00:14:44,942
ls this seat taken?

88
00:14:46,111 --> 00:14:48,696
Hi, I'm Millburn, Biology. Nice to meet you.

89
00:14:50,907 --> 00:14:51,657
Okay.

90
00:14:51,824 --> 00:14:55,327
Look, no offense, but...

91
00:14:55,869 --> 00:14:57,913
...I've been asleep two years.

92
00:14:58,581 --> 00:15:01,125
I ain't here to be your friend.

93
00:15:01,459 --> 00:15:02,751
I'm here to make money.

94
00:15:03,877 --> 00:15:05,212
You got that?

95
00:15:07,757 --> 00:15:09,091
Okay.

96
00:15:09,425 --> 00:15:12,137
I bet a hundred credits
it's a terraforming survey.

97
00:15:12,304 --> 00:15:14,264
No, if it's a survey, they would tell us.

98
00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:16,682
It's a corporate run,
they're not telling us shit.

99
00:15:16,849 --> 00:15:17,683
Come on.

100
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:19,769
-A hundred.
-All right, you're on.

101
00:15:24,439 --> 00:15:25,858
You look nervous, El.

102
00:15:26,442 --> 00:15:29,278
-I'll try to keep my feet on the ground.
-l know you will.

103
00:15:29,445 --> 00:15:30,362
Good morning.

104
00:15:31,113 --> 00:15:33,657
For those of you I hired personally...

105
00:15:34,658 --> 00:15:36,785
...it's nice to see you again.

106
00:15:37,577 --> 00:15:41,456
For the rest of you, I am Meredith Vickers.
It's my job to make sure you do yours.

107
00:15:41,957 --> 00:15:44,543
Okay, then. On with the show.

108
00:15:50,131 --> 00:15:51,882
Weyland Corporation.

109
00:15:52,134 --> 00:15:54,135
Building better worlds.

110
00:15:55,428 --> 00:15:57,013
Hello, friends.

111
00:15:58,974 --> 00:16:00,726
My name is Peter Weyland.

112
00:16:02,769 --> 00:16:04,562
I am your employer.

113
00:16:04,813 --> 00:16:09,860
I am recording this, 22 June, 2091.
And if you're watching it...

114
00:16:10,694 --> 00:16:12,821
...you have reached your destination.

115
00:16:13,488 --> 00:16:15,490
And I am long dead.

116
00:16:16,115 --> 00:16:18,075
May I rest in peace.

117
00:16:19,286 --> 00:16:22,455
There's a man sitting with you today.
His name is David.

118
00:16:22,622 --> 00:16:25,667
And he is the closest thing to a son
I will ever have.

119
00:16:25,959 --> 00:16:28,712
Unfortunately, he is not human.

120
00:16:29,045 --> 00:16:30,255
He will never grow old...

121
00:16:30,505 --> 00:16:32,383
...and he will never die.

122
00:16:33,342 --> 00:16:36,511
And yet he is unable to appreciate
these remarkable gifts...

123
00:16:36,678 --> 00:16:41,015
...for that would require the one thing
that David will never have.

124
00:16:41,224 --> 00:16:42,350
A soul.

125
00:16:43,351 --> 00:16:45,061
I have spent my entire...

126
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:47,731
...lifetime contemplating the questions:

127
00:16:48,023 --> 00:16:49,524
Where do we come from?

128
00:16:49,858 --> 00:16:51,359
What is our purpose?

129
00:16:51,609 --> 00:16:53,028
What happens when we die?

130
00:16:53,737 --> 00:16:57,657
And I have found two people who convinced
me they're on the verge of answering them.

131
00:16:58,366 --> 00:17:01,328
Drs. Holloway and Shaw,
if you would please stand.

132
00:17:03,663 --> 00:17:05,707
As far as you're concerned,
they're in charge.

133
00:17:06,833 --> 00:17:11,420
The Titan Prometheus wanted to give
mankind equal footing with the gods...

134
00:17:11,587 --> 00:17:15,175
...and for that, he was cast from Olympus.

135
00:17:16,050 --> 00:17:20,889
Well, my friends,
the time has finally come for his return.

136
00:17:21,515 --> 00:17:22,474
Doctors, please.

137
00:17:26,812 --> 00:17:27,730
The floor is yours.

138
00:17:36,237 --> 00:17:38,239
Okay, wow.

139
00:17:38,406 --> 00:17:39,783
All right.

140
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:41,743
I never had to follow a ghost before.

141
00:17:42,118 --> 00:17:44,162
Okay, let me show you why you guys...

142
00:17:44,370 --> 00:17:45,455
...are here.

143
00:17:52,921 --> 00:17:58,092
These are images of archeological digs
from all over the Earth.

144
00:17:58,259 --> 00:17:59,093
That's...

145
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:02,638
...Egyptian, Mayan, Sumerian, Babylonian.

146
00:18:02,888 --> 00:18:05,683
That's Hawaiian there at the end,
then Mesopotamian.

147
00:18:05,933 --> 00:18:08,936
Now, this one here
is our most recent discovery.

148
00:18:09,103 --> 00:18:13,107
It's a 35,000-year-old cave painting
from the lsle of Skye in Scotland.

149
00:18:13,399 --> 00:18:17,611
These are ancient civilizations.
They were separated by centuries.

150
00:18:17,778 --> 00:18:20,865
They shared no contact with one another,
and yet....

151
00:18:24,702 --> 00:18:25,786
The same pictogram...

152
00:18:25,953 --> 00:18:29,581
...showing men worshipping giant beings,
pointing to the stars...

153
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:32,752
...was discovered
at every last one of them.

154
00:18:33,294 --> 00:18:35,921
And the only galactic system
that matched...

155
00:18:36,964 --> 00:18:39,509
...was so far from Earth
that there's no way...

156
00:18:39,675 --> 00:18:43,804
...that these primitive, ancient civilizations
could have possibly known about it.

157
00:18:43,971 --> 00:18:45,472
But itjust so happens...

158
00:18:47,183 --> 00:18:48,518
...that that system...

159
00:18:49,977 --> 00:18:51,103
...has a sun...

160
00:18:52,146 --> 00:18:53,564
...a lot like ours.

161
00:18:54,648 --> 00:18:58,944
And, based on our long-range scans,
there seemed to be a planet.

162
00:19:00,362 --> 00:19:02,614
Just one planet with a moon...

163
00:19:02,823 --> 00:19:04,741
...capable of sustaining life.

164
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,245
And we arrived there this morning.

165
00:19:10,497 --> 00:19:15,336
So you're saying we're here because of a map
you two kids found in a cave. ls that right?

166
00:19:16,629 --> 00:19:17,880
-No.
-Yeah.

167
00:19:20,174 --> 00:19:22,634
No. Not a map, an invitation.

168
00:19:22,801 --> 00:19:24,177
From who?

169
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:27,431
We call them Engineers.

170
00:19:28,349 --> 00:19:29,850
Engineers?

171
00:19:30,017 --> 00:19:30,851
Do you mind...

172
00:19:31,894 --> 00:19:33,688
...telling us what they engineered?

173
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:37,358
They engineered us.

174
00:19:40,111 --> 00:19:40,945
Bullshit.

175
00:19:43,156 --> 00:19:45,032
Okay, so do you...

176
00:19:45,199 --> 00:19:46,867
...have anything to back that up?

177
00:19:47,576 --> 00:19:49,369
Look, if you're willing to discount...

178
00:19:49,578 --> 00:19:51,371
...centuries of Darwinism, that's....

179
00:19:54,583 --> 00:19:55,501
But how do you know?

180
00:19:57,044 --> 00:19:58,378
I don't.

181
00:19:58,879 --> 00:20:01,006
But it's what I choose to believe.

182
00:20:28,908 --> 00:20:29,951
Doctors.

183
00:20:31,035 --> 00:20:35,082
Miss Vickers would like to have
a quick word before the adventure begins.

184
00:20:42,588 --> 00:20:43,547
Wow, nice place.

185
00:20:43,714 --> 00:20:47,844
It's actually a separate module
with its own self-contained life support.

186
00:20:48,303 --> 00:20:49,971
Air, food.

187
00:20:50,263 --> 00:20:53,850
Anything Miss Vickers would need
to survive a hostile environment.

188
00:20:54,101 --> 00:20:56,061
Okay, so she lives on a lifeboat.

189
00:20:56,227 --> 00:20:57,270
Yes.

190
00:20:57,437 --> 00:20:58,104
I do.

191
00:20:58,271 --> 00:21:00,524
I like to minimize risk.

192
00:21:01,108 --> 00:21:04,694
David, why don't you make
the doctors a drink?

193
00:21:05,278 --> 00:21:08,031
I'll take a vodka. Up.

194
00:21:08,448 --> 00:21:09,866
Charlie, look.

195
00:21:10,074 --> 00:21:12,409
It's a Pauling Med-Pod.

196
00:21:12,702 --> 00:21:15,080
They only made a dozen of these.

197
00:21:15,246 --> 00:21:16,080
Miss Shaw.

198
00:21:16,247 --> 00:21:18,708
Please verbally state
the nature of your injury.

199
00:21:19,166 --> 00:21:20,794
Please don't touch that.

200
00:21:20,961 --> 00:21:22,921
It's a very expensive piece of machinery.

201
00:21:23,463 --> 00:21:25,966
lt does bypass surgery.
What do you need it for?

202
00:21:27,801 --> 00:21:30,428
There might be some confusion
about our relationship.

203
00:21:31,513 --> 00:21:34,307
Weyland found you impressive enough
to fund this mission.

204
00:21:34,515 --> 00:21:36,976
But I'm fairly certain your Engineers
are scribblings...

205
00:21:37,143 --> 00:21:39,354
...of savages living in dirty little caves.

206
00:21:40,605 --> 00:21:43,650
But let's say I'm wrong,
and you do find these beings down there...

207
00:21:44,817 --> 00:21:46,945
...you won't engage them...

208
00:21:47,237 --> 00:21:48,738
...you won't talk to them.

209
00:21:48,989 --> 00:21:51,616
You will do nothing
but report back to me.

210
00:21:55,162 --> 00:21:57,414
Miss Vickers, is there an agenda that...

211
00:21:57,581 --> 00:21:59,207
...you're not telling us about?

212
00:21:59,791 --> 00:22:00,458
My company...

213
00:22:00,625 --> 00:22:03,169
...paid a trillion dollars to find this place
and bring you.

214
00:22:03,336 --> 00:22:06,131
Had you raised the monies yourself,
Mr. Holloway...

215
00:22:06,298 --> 00:22:09,175
...we'd happily be pursuing your agenda.

216
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:11,761
But you didn't.

217
00:22:12,178 --> 00:22:13,763
And that makes you an employee.

218
00:22:15,222 --> 00:22:17,224
But if we can't make contact...

219
00:22:17,391 --> 00:22:19,894
...why did you even bring us here?

220
00:22:20,686 --> 00:22:23,439
Weyland was a superstitious man.

221
00:22:24,148 --> 00:22:26,525
He wanted a true believer onboard.

222
00:22:29,194 --> 00:22:30,403
Cheers.

223
00:22:33,699 --> 00:22:34,867
So no response?

224
00:22:35,534 --> 00:22:36,618
I'm sorry, no.

225
00:22:36,785 --> 00:22:38,703
Maybe they didn't understand it.

226
00:22:40,081 --> 00:22:42,124
How are your lessons going, David?

227
00:22:43,334 --> 00:22:46,879
I spent two years deconstructing
dozens of ancient languages...

228
00:22:47,505 --> 00:22:49,131
...to their roots. I'm confident...

229
00:22:49,298 --> 00:22:50,800
...l can communicate with them...

230
00:22:51,050 --> 00:22:53,218
...provided your thesis is correct.

231
00:22:54,511 --> 00:22:56,638
''Provided it's correct.'' That's good.

232
00:22:56,805 --> 00:22:59,725
That's why they call it a thesis, doctor.

233
00:23:02,811 --> 00:23:04,521
What are you smiling about?

234
00:23:04,688 --> 00:23:06,566
Mr. Ravel, Mr. Chance, take her down.

235
00:23:06,732 --> 00:23:08,234
-Roger that.
-Yes, captain.

236
00:23:08,609 --> 00:23:10,069
Descent trajectory mapped.

237
00:23:10,402 --> 00:23:11,779
How we doing?

238
00:23:11,945 --> 00:23:13,031
Great.

239
00:23:14,282 --> 00:23:15,074
All right, boss.

240
00:23:15,741 --> 00:23:16,534
All personnel...

241
00:23:16,701 --> 00:23:17,868
...this is the captain.

242
00:23:18,035 --> 00:23:19,453
Brace for entry.

243
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:20,871
Yes, captain.

244
00:23:21,413 --> 00:23:22,914
That means you too, Vickers.

245
00:23:23,081 --> 00:23:24,166
All systems...

246
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:25,333
...online.

247
00:23:32,716 --> 00:23:33,968
What is the atmosphere?

248
00:23:34,135 --> 00:23:35,344
Atmosphere is...

249
00:23:35,511 --> 00:23:36,762
...71 percent nitrogen...

250
00:23:36,929 --> 00:23:38,097
...21 percent oxygen...

251
00:23:38,263 --> 00:23:39,389
...traces of argon gas.

252
00:23:39,599 --> 00:23:41,642
Whoa, now, that's weather.

253
00:23:41,851 --> 00:23:42,935
Just like home.

254
00:23:43,102 --> 00:23:44,937
lf you're breathing
through an exhaust pipe.

255
00:23:45,437 --> 00:23:47,397
CO2 is over 3 percent.

256
00:23:47,564 --> 00:23:49,608
Two minutes without a suit, you're dead.

257
00:23:53,112 --> 00:23:54,238
Peak portside.

258
00:23:54,488 --> 00:23:56,240
Whoa, 52,000!

259
00:23:56,490 --> 00:23:58,617
lt makes Everest
look like a baby brother.

260
00:23:58,909 --> 00:24:01,120
All right, take us around.

261
00:24:01,287 --> 00:24:02,997
We'll use that as our point of entry.

262
00:24:05,457 --> 00:24:07,710
Terrain data rezzing up. We've got...

263
00:24:07,877 --> 00:24:09,295
...a couple of hard spots.

264
00:24:09,462 --> 00:24:10,963
Could be metal.

265
00:24:31,774 --> 00:24:32,985
No radio, no heat source.

266
00:24:34,069 --> 00:24:35,153
Nobody's home.

267
00:24:36,404 --> 00:24:37,989
There is nothing in the desert...

268
00:24:38,823 --> 00:24:40,491
...and no man needs nothing.

269
00:24:40,867 --> 00:24:42,076
What was that?

270
00:24:43,327 --> 00:24:45,412
Just something from a film I like.

271
00:24:49,751 --> 00:24:51,168
Let's go through that gateway.

272
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:53,505
Reduce airspeed by a hundred knots.

273
00:24:58,176 --> 00:25:00,929
Going through. Nice and slow.

274
00:25:06,934 --> 00:25:08,019
Keep it steady, boys.

275
00:25:08,186 --> 00:25:08,853
There.

276
00:25:09,353 --> 00:25:11,021
No, what are you doing?

277
00:25:11,188 --> 00:25:14,067
Dr. Holloway, why don't you take a seat?

278
00:25:15,401 --> 00:25:17,320
Right there. God does not build in...

279
00:25:17,487 --> 00:25:20,615
...straight lines.
Starboard side, this valley! Captain...

280
00:25:20,782 --> 00:25:22,283
...could you put us down there?

281
00:25:22,492 --> 00:25:24,702
I wouldn't be any good
if I couldn't do that.

282
00:25:24,869 --> 00:25:28,206
Mr. Ravel, starboard 90 degrees.

283
00:25:33,086 --> 00:25:36,297
-One mile, port bow.
-One mile, port bow.

284
00:25:36,589 --> 00:25:38,215
Engage landing sequence.

285
00:25:38,382 --> 00:25:39,508
Switch to manual.

286
00:25:39,675 --> 00:25:40,844
-Commence landing.
-Easy.

287
00:25:41,010 --> 00:25:43,054
-Roger that.
-Yeah, baby, yeah.

288
00:25:45,848 --> 00:25:47,225
Bringing her down in five.

289
00:25:47,392 --> 00:25:49,185
-Preparing RCS thrusters.
-Four.

290
00:25:52,855 --> 00:25:54,566
Two. Easy does it.

291
00:26:12,208 --> 00:26:14,920
Generator systems are inactive.

292
00:26:15,086 --> 00:26:17,422
Temperature is at 2.724 K.

293
00:26:29,308 --> 00:26:30,351
Captain, would you...

294
00:26:30,518 --> 00:26:32,520
...tell the survey team to suit up...

295
00:26:32,686 --> 00:26:34,105
...and meet us in the airlock.

296
00:26:34,647 --> 00:26:36,441
Only six hours left of daylight.

297
00:26:36,607 --> 00:26:38,276
-Leave it till morning.
-No, no, no.

298
00:26:38,985 --> 00:26:40,444
It's Christmas, captain...

299
00:26:40,611 --> 00:26:42,488
...and I want to open my presents.

300
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:43,614
You, boy.

301
00:26:43,781 --> 00:26:45,115
You're coming with us.

302
00:26:45,449 --> 00:26:46,909
I'd be delighted.

303
00:26:52,456 --> 00:26:55,083
Attention: Ramp will open in five minutes.

304
00:26:57,294 --> 00:26:58,878
Hey, Jackson...

305
00:26:59,254 --> 00:27:00,506
...what's that for?

306
00:27:01,298 --> 00:27:02,257
Expedition security.

307
00:27:02,466 --> 00:27:05,051
My job is to make sure
everybody is nice and safe.

308
00:27:06,637 --> 00:27:09,598
This is a scientific expedition.
No weapons.

309
00:27:09,765 --> 00:27:10,808
All right, then.

310
00:27:11,183 --> 00:27:12,559
Good luck with that.

311
00:27:15,521 --> 00:27:17,314
David, why are you wearing a suit, man?

312
00:27:18,816 --> 00:27:19,942
I beg your pardon?

313
00:27:20,108 --> 00:27:21,777
You don't breathe, remember?

314
00:27:21,943 --> 00:27:24,070
So why wear a suit?

315
00:27:24,696 --> 00:27:26,824
I was designed like this...

316
00:27:27,116 --> 00:27:31,203
...because you people are more comfortable
interacting with your own kind.

317
00:27:32,329 --> 00:27:35,666
lf I didn't wear the suit,
it would defeat the purpose.

318
00:27:36,625 --> 00:27:38,585
They're making you guys pretty close, huh?

319
00:27:39,169 --> 00:27:40,630
Not too close, I hope.

320
00:27:50,472 --> 00:27:53,016
Attention: Ramp will open in 15 seconds.

321
00:27:58,396 --> 00:28:00,107
Ramp will open in five...

322
00:28:00,274 --> 00:28:04,319
...four, three, two, one.

323
00:28:21,754 --> 00:28:23,046
Hey.

324
00:28:23,755 --> 00:28:26,174
This is just one small step for mankind.

325
00:28:27,051 --> 00:28:28,052
Seriously?

326
00:28:34,225 --> 00:28:36,018
You ready to do this? I know you are.

327
00:28:46,694 --> 00:28:47,655
Hey, Fifield.

328
00:28:47,821 --> 00:28:48,989
I want a spectrograph on this.

329
00:28:49,198 --> 00:28:51,408
I want to know if it's natural
or if somebody put it there.

330
00:28:51,575 --> 00:28:54,285
I can't tell you if it's natural or not.
But what I can...

331
00:28:54,411 --> 00:28:56,537
...tell you is, it's hollow.

332
00:29:20,687 --> 00:29:24,440
Prometheus, are you seeing this?

333
00:29:24,774 --> 00:29:25,942
Affirmative.

334
00:29:26,275 --> 00:29:27,569
We see it.

335
00:29:34,784 --> 00:29:35,451
Okay, ready?

336
00:29:35,618 --> 00:29:37,119
-Yeah.
-Let's do it.

337
00:30:10,528 --> 00:30:12,696
-After you.
-After you.

338
00:30:12,822 --> 00:30:13,782
Okay.

339
00:30:13,949 --> 00:30:14,991
Careful.

340
00:30:15,658 --> 00:30:17,618
Prometheus, we're going in.

341
00:30:17,869 --> 00:30:18,995
Copy that.

342
00:30:52,528 --> 00:30:53,363
What's back here?

343
00:30:53,529 --> 00:30:55,656
Some kind of a corridor?

344
00:30:56,574 --> 00:30:59,159
Mr. Fifield,
let's get a grid of the structure.

345
00:30:59,326 --> 00:31:00,703
I want the whole interior.

346
00:31:01,704 --> 00:31:03,998
lf there's anything in here
worth looking at...

347
00:31:04,165 --> 00:31:05,416
...these pups'll find them.

348
00:31:06,083 --> 00:31:07,042
''Pups''?

349
00:31:07,209 --> 00:31:09,545
Yeah, pups. My pups.

350
00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:27,104
Prometheus, we are now mapping.

351
00:31:31,399 --> 00:31:32,484
Copy that.

352
00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:45,831
Well, I'll be damned.

353
00:32:00,554 --> 00:32:01,805
Fifield, you got a read?

354
00:32:01,972 --> 00:32:03,098
Yeah.

355
00:32:03,849 --> 00:32:06,810
Pups are saying this way.

356
00:32:25,370 --> 00:32:26,788
Look at this.

357
00:32:34,130 --> 00:32:35,756
Oh, Charlie.

358
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:40,802
Jesus.

359
00:32:41,136 --> 00:32:42,971
The sunlight is heating the water.

360
00:32:43,638 --> 00:32:45,223
Check out the humidity.

361
00:32:45,431 --> 00:32:47,016
Yeah, and look at the CO2 levels.

362
00:32:47,559 --> 00:32:48,602
Outside...

363
00:32:48,769 --> 00:32:50,812
...it's completely toxic, and in here...

364
00:32:50,979 --> 00:32:53,064
...there's nothing. It's breathable.

365
00:32:55,150 --> 00:32:56,735
What are you doing?

366
00:32:56,902 --> 00:32:59,154
-Don't be an idiot.
-Don't be a skeptic.

367
00:32:59,696 --> 00:33:01,782
There's something
generating an atmosphere.

368
00:33:02,158 --> 00:33:03,409
David?

369
00:33:03,576 --> 00:33:05,702
-Dr. Holloway is correct.
-Cleaner than Earth...

370
00:33:05,911 --> 00:33:07,079
...actually.

371
00:33:07,246 --> 00:33:08,163
They were terraforming.

372
00:33:08,497 --> 00:33:09,956
Please don't do--

373
00:33:10,123 --> 00:33:11,958
I'm not wearing this thing anymore.

374
00:33:12,458 --> 00:33:13,710
Wish me luck, baby.

375
00:33:13,961 --> 00:33:16,505
Do you copy?
Do not remove your headgear.

376
00:33:33,104 --> 00:33:35,022
You crazy bastard.

377
00:33:39,693 --> 00:33:40,945
Connect our suit cameras...

378
00:33:41,112 --> 00:33:45,366
...if you want to continue watching this
freak show. We are taking our helmets off.

379
00:33:46,492 --> 00:33:48,203
Copy that. Switching feeds.

380
00:33:50,204 --> 00:33:52,373
Well, come on. Pay up.

381
00:33:53,082 --> 00:33:55,794
-Pay what?
-What do you mean, ''Pay what''?

382
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:59,464
Something is manufacturing
breathable air down there. That, mate...

383
00:33:59,630 --> 00:34:02,383
-...is terraforming.
-No, no. The bet was why we came here.

384
00:34:02,550 --> 00:34:05,427
lf you said a dead old man wanted
to talk to Martians, I'd pay.

385
00:34:05,594 --> 00:34:06,970
Come on, a hundred credits.

386
00:34:07,137 --> 00:34:10,141
Put it towards a lap dance with
Miss Vickers. How about that?

387
00:34:12,226 --> 00:34:14,396
It's minus 12 in here.

388
00:34:14,562 --> 00:34:16,689
So why is this water not frozen?

389
00:34:16,856 --> 00:34:18,274
Maybe it ain't water.

390
00:34:19,025 --> 00:34:20,484
Maybe it's Martian piss.

391
00:34:22,529 --> 00:34:25,573
That's your scientific theory?

392
00:34:25,740 --> 00:34:27,658
ls it? Mr. Biology?

393
00:34:31,870 --> 00:34:33,747
Whatever it is, it sure is collagenous.

394
00:34:34,874 --> 00:34:36,584
Some kind of sediment, perhaps.

395
00:34:56,604 --> 00:34:57,730
lmpressive.

396
00:35:17,459 --> 00:35:18,209
What was that?

397
00:35:19,127 --> 00:35:20,336
David?

398
00:35:21,254 --> 00:35:21,879
David?

399
00:35:23,339 --> 00:35:24,548
What is that?

400
00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:27,468
David?

401
00:35:36,143 --> 00:35:37,436
Ellie!

402
00:35:42,316 --> 00:35:43,150
What was that?

403
00:35:43,942 --> 00:35:45,819
I'm really glad we didn't bring weapons.

404
00:35:45,986 --> 00:35:48,280
-Come on, El. Let's go.
-Whose idea was that?

405
00:35:48,697 --> 00:35:49,614
Keep up!

406
00:35:52,075 --> 00:35:52,742
Come on!

407
00:36:00,708 --> 00:36:02,044
Where did he go?

408
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:08,926
Wait, wait, wait.

409
00:36:13,889 --> 00:36:16,975
There it is. There it is. There it is.

410
00:36:17,976 --> 00:36:20,478
Oh, my God, Charlie. We found them.

411
00:36:20,645 --> 00:36:22,189
What do you mean ''them''?

412
00:36:23,482 --> 00:36:24,899
lt is them, Ellie.

413
00:36:25,692 --> 00:36:27,277
lt looks like a door...

414
00:36:27,653 --> 00:36:31,615
...and he's been decapitated by it.

415
00:36:32,866 --> 00:36:34,368
Son of a bitch.

416
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:37,496
They were right.

417
00:36:40,999 --> 00:36:43,084
What did you want them to be? Wrong?

418
00:36:46,879 --> 00:36:48,006
David...

419
00:36:48,715 --> 00:36:50,383
...please tell me you can read that.

420
00:36:51,051 --> 00:36:52,302
Perhaps.

421
00:36:54,555 --> 00:36:56,223
No, I'm out of here.

422
00:36:58,225 --> 00:37:00,060
Hey, Fifield, where are you going?

423
00:37:01,729 --> 00:37:02,813
What?

424
00:37:04,565 --> 00:37:07,234
Look, I'm just a geologist.

425
00:37:07,401 --> 00:37:09,569
I like rocks. I love rocks!

426
00:37:10,028 --> 00:37:12,488
Now it's clear
you two don't give a shit about rocks.

427
00:37:12,655 --> 00:37:15,200
But what you do seem to care about
is gigantic dead...

428
00:37:15,409 --> 00:37:16,118
...bodies.

429
00:37:16,326 --> 00:37:19,287
As I don't really have anything
to contribute in the gigantic...

430
00:37:19,496 --> 00:37:20,914
...dead body arena...

431
00:37:22,458 --> 00:37:25,961
...l want to go back to the ship,
if you don't mind.

432
00:37:29,423 --> 00:37:30,174
Anyone wanna...

433
00:37:30,341 --> 00:37:32,467
...join me, hey? You staying?

434
00:37:34,177 --> 00:37:35,220
No, ship's good.

435
00:37:35,387 --> 00:37:37,597
Yeah. Ship very good.

436
00:37:38,556 --> 00:37:41,602
Congratulations on meeting your maker.

437
00:37:42,394 --> 00:37:43,562
Thank you.

438
00:37:44,271 --> 00:37:45,021
Pull yourself...

439
00:37:45,188 --> 00:37:46,106
...together, man.

440
00:37:49,567 --> 00:37:52,528
And I thought you were the crazy one.

441
00:38:00,411 --> 00:38:02,204
Do you have the carbon reader?

442
00:38:04,623 --> 00:38:05,916
Thank you.

443
00:38:12,131 --> 00:38:13,257
How long's it been dead?

444
00:38:16,052 --> 00:38:17,136
Two thousand years...

445
00:38:17,303 --> 00:38:18,471
...give or take.

446
00:38:22,058 --> 00:38:23,643
What are you doing, David?

447
00:38:24,602 --> 00:38:26,312
I'm attempting to open the door.

448
00:38:26,479 --> 00:38:28,772
Wait. We don't know
what's on the other side.

449
00:38:31,150 --> 00:38:32,568
Oops. Sorry.

450
00:38:37,239 --> 00:38:39,575
Look, Ford. It's the head.

451
00:38:50,086 --> 00:38:52,338
An amazing state of preservation.

452
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:54,382
-We'll take it in.
-Yeah.

453
00:38:58,469 --> 00:39:00,012
Remarkably human.

454
00:39:17,697 --> 00:39:19,365
Beautiful painting.

455
00:39:20,491 --> 00:39:21,784
It's a mural.

456
00:39:34,379 --> 00:39:35,048
Stop.

457
00:39:35,215 --> 00:39:36,382
Stop. Don't touch it.

458
00:39:36,549 --> 00:39:37,633
Sorry.

459
00:39:38,801 --> 00:39:40,761
Please, don't touch anything.

460
00:39:41,721 --> 00:39:42,389
Sweating.

461
00:40:21,343 --> 00:40:22,511
Organic.

462
00:40:29,101 --> 00:40:30,102
Oh, no.

463
00:40:30,394 --> 00:40:33,104
Charlie, the murals are changing.

464
00:40:33,271 --> 00:40:35,649
I think we've affected the atmosphere
in the room.

465
00:40:35,899 --> 00:40:37,734
Charlie, do you copy?

466
00:40:38,777 --> 00:40:39,611
Oh, the head!

467
00:40:39,903 --> 00:40:41,988
Ford, quick, help me bag the head!

468
00:40:53,625 --> 00:40:55,127
-Boss.
-What you got?

469
00:40:56,128 --> 00:40:58,046
We got an incoming storm front.

470
00:40:58,213 --> 00:40:59,381
Silica...

471
00:40:59,547 --> 00:41:01,550
...and lots of static. This is not good.

472
00:41:01,717 --> 00:41:02,468
I see it.

473
00:41:06,555 --> 00:41:07,389
Ground crew...

474
00:41:07,597 --> 00:41:08,598
...this is Janek.

475
00:41:08,765 --> 00:41:10,600
I need you to hustle back right now.

476
00:41:10,892 --> 00:41:12,393
Ground crew, do you copy me?

477
00:41:12,602 --> 00:41:13,895
I got 200-kilometer...

478
00:41:14,061 --> 00:41:15,647
...winds of airborne silica...

479
00:41:15,772 --> 00:41:17,274
...and enough static to fry your suit.

480
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:18,942
Copy that, sir.

481
00:41:19,108 --> 00:41:20,068
We need more time.

482
00:41:20,777 --> 00:41:22,112
I'll be closing the outer...

483
00:41:22,279 --> 00:41:23,488
...doors in 15 minutes.

484
00:41:23,655 --> 00:41:25,824
I sincerely hope you can make it.

485
00:41:28,577 --> 00:41:30,496
Charlie! David!

486
00:41:31,079 --> 00:41:32,164
We must leave now.

487
00:41:34,332 --> 00:41:36,000
This is just another tomb.

488
00:41:40,504 --> 00:41:41,715
David!

489
00:41:44,592 --> 00:41:46,469
-On three.
-Two, three, up.

490
00:41:46,636 --> 00:41:48,012
Let's go!

491
00:41:48,764 --> 00:41:50,515
Easy, easy, easy. Careful.

492
00:41:53,601 --> 00:41:56,313
David, we are leaving!

493
00:42:05,863 --> 00:42:06,697
Come on!

494
00:42:06,864 --> 00:42:08,575
Damn it, they've already taken off.

495
00:42:08,742 --> 00:42:09,701
Come on, let's go.

496
00:42:11,369 --> 00:42:14,497
Prometheus to ground crew.
You're running out of time.

497
00:42:14,706 --> 00:42:16,707
All right, come on. Let's go.

498
00:42:32,014 --> 00:42:33,390
Go faster!

499
00:42:57,247 --> 00:42:58,373
Charlie! The head!

500
00:42:59,374 --> 00:42:59,916
Ellie, no!

501
00:43:00,083 --> 00:43:00,750
What are you doing?

502
00:43:09,552 --> 00:43:10,344
Hatch closure...

503
00:43:10,511 --> 00:43:11,512
-...in five seconds.
-Shit.

504
00:43:12,805 --> 00:43:13,555
Damn it, hold on!

505
00:43:15,934 --> 00:43:16,684
Goddamn it.

506
00:43:16,893 --> 00:43:18,019
Door closing.

507
00:43:20,229 --> 00:43:21,313
Ellie, don't move!

508
00:43:26,526 --> 00:43:27,194
Charlie!

509
00:43:30,739 --> 00:43:31,782
Grab my hand!

510
00:43:42,961 --> 00:43:43,378
No!

511
00:43:44,504 --> 00:43:45,421
No, Ellie!

512
00:43:45,588 --> 00:43:46,380
Ellie!

513
00:44:24,668 --> 00:44:25,669
Got it.

514
00:44:33,635 --> 00:44:35,471
So, what was that, Ellie?

515
00:44:35,763 --> 00:44:38,140
You could've compromised the mission.
Not to mention...

516
00:44:38,348 --> 00:44:39,808
...almost killing yourself!

517
00:44:39,975 --> 00:44:40,975
Are you all right?

518
00:44:41,393 --> 00:44:42,727
Yes.

519
00:44:43,019 --> 00:44:44,187
Thank you, David.

520
00:44:44,687 --> 00:44:46,188
My pleasure.

521
00:44:46,522 --> 00:44:48,315
Doctors, it's real good to have...

522
00:44:48,525 --> 00:44:50,819
...you back,
but where's Millburn and Fifield?

523
00:44:50,985 --> 00:44:52,695
Aren't they back yet?

524
00:44:54,197 --> 00:44:55,699
-Get them up for me.
-All right.

525
00:44:58,660 --> 00:45:00,370
We've been here before, Fifield.

526
00:45:00,537 --> 00:45:03,207
I don't know. It all looks the same to me.

527
00:45:04,166 --> 00:45:06,209
Boys, this is the captain. Listen up.

528
00:45:06,835 --> 00:45:09,546
Between the static electricity
and the wind speed...

529
00:45:09,712 --> 00:45:12,006
...well, there ain't no safe way
to come get you.

530
00:45:12,632 --> 00:45:13,382
What?

531
00:45:13,549 --> 00:45:17,053
The temperature is dropping rapidly,
so get your helmets on and stay warm...

532
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:19,722
...until the storm passes.

533
00:45:19,889 --> 00:45:20,723
Captain...

534
00:45:21,057 --> 00:45:24,227
...can you get a message to the scientist
and his zealot girlfriend?

535
00:45:25,395 --> 00:45:26,438
You got a pen nearby?

536
00:45:26,604 --> 00:45:28,523
No. No, I think we got it.

537
00:45:29,191 --> 00:45:31,026
Tell them I said...themselves.

538
00:45:32,277 --> 00:45:33,069
Copy?

539
00:45:33,278 --> 00:45:35,488
Copy that.
All right, boys, keep your head down...

540
00:45:35,655 --> 00:45:37,949
...and we'll come get you in the morning.

541
00:45:39,700 --> 00:45:40,701
Well, which way now?

542
00:45:40,868 --> 00:45:41,660
All right.

543
00:45:41,827 --> 00:45:43,872
Well, which way, huh?

544
00:45:57,844 --> 00:45:59,846
Sample is sterile. No contagion present.

545
00:46:00,263 --> 00:46:01,264
David.

546
00:46:04,559 --> 00:46:06,435
So are they all dead?

547
00:46:07,853 --> 00:46:09,773
What? Who?

548
00:46:10,398 --> 00:46:11,608
Your Engineers.

549
00:46:12,108 --> 00:46:13,776
Are they all dead or aren't they?

550
00:46:13,985 --> 00:46:15,445
I don't know.

551
00:46:15,612 --> 00:46:16,905
We just got here.

552
00:46:17,364 --> 00:46:18,073
Scan.

553
00:46:20,783 --> 00:46:22,244
Do you care if they're dead?

554
00:46:23,162 --> 00:46:24,580
Weyland cared.

555
00:46:24,871 --> 00:46:26,456
Dr. Shaw.

556
00:46:26,748 --> 00:46:27,791
Have a look at this.

557
00:46:32,462 --> 00:46:34,422
-That's not an exoskeleton.
-No.

558
00:46:34,588 --> 00:46:36,591
I think it's a helmet.

559
00:46:36,883 --> 00:46:39,135
-Let's see if we can lift it up.
-We should...

560
00:46:39,302 --> 00:46:40,720
...be able to prize this open.

561
00:46:41,512 --> 00:46:43,806
It's too heavy for us. David?

562
00:46:50,938 --> 00:46:52,148
Careful.

563
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:54,149
Like so.

564
00:47:07,996 --> 00:47:09,790
What is that on its head?

565
00:47:10,249 --> 00:47:12,376
lt looks like new cells.

566
00:47:13,293 --> 00:47:15,295
-ln a state of....
-Change.

567
00:47:15,463 --> 00:47:16,172
Yes.

568
00:47:16,506 --> 00:47:17,840
Changing into what?

569
00:47:18,257 --> 00:47:20,509
Can you run a stem line
into the locus coeruleus?

570
00:47:20,843 --> 00:47:24,096
I think we can trick the nervous system
into thinking it's still alive.

571
00:47:25,722 --> 00:47:26,973
-Thirty amps.
-Okay.

572
00:47:27,557 --> 00:47:28,433
No more.

573
00:47:29,977 --> 00:47:32,020
Let me make an incision.

574
00:47:32,771 --> 00:47:33,522
Okay.

575
00:47:39,111 --> 00:47:40,529
Go up, 40.

576
00:47:42,573 --> 00:47:43,658
Okay, 40 up.

577
00:47:44,951 --> 00:47:46,369
Did you see that?

578
00:47:47,995 --> 00:47:49,788
-Yes.
-Yep. See?

579
00:47:49,955 --> 00:47:51,540
Go up another 10.

580
00:47:51,873 --> 00:47:53,333
Okay, up 10.

581
00:47:55,711 --> 00:47:56,754
Maybe it's a little...

582
00:47:56,962 --> 00:47:58,756
-...too much. Go down 10.
-Okay.

583
00:47:58,964 --> 00:48:00,382
-Down 10.
-Down another 20.

584
00:48:00,924 --> 00:48:01,716
Okay, I'm trying.

585
00:48:02,718 --> 00:48:04,345
I'm trying, it's not going down.

586
00:48:04,512 --> 00:48:05,763
Full down. Ford...

587
00:48:06,013 --> 00:48:06,889
...stop it.

588
00:48:07,056 --> 00:48:08,307
Oh, God.

589
00:48:08,557 --> 00:48:10,643
David, contain it! Now!

590
00:48:10,810 --> 00:48:12,019
Contain it? Turn it off!

591
00:48:12,395 --> 00:48:13,813
Oh, God. The smell!

592
00:48:14,688 --> 00:48:15,731
Oh, God, look at that.

593
00:48:15,898 --> 00:48:16,899
Look at that.

594
00:48:17,065 --> 00:48:18,233
It's getting worse.

595
00:48:33,916 --> 00:48:35,710
Mortal, after all.

596
00:48:43,092 --> 00:48:44,426
Ford, take a sample.

597
00:48:45,594 --> 00:48:47,220
Let's have a look.

598
00:48:51,809 --> 00:48:54,269
No, sir, I will take care of it.

599
00:48:54,603 --> 00:48:56,980
Yes, sir, understood. I'm sorry.

600
00:48:57,981 --> 00:49:00,608
Fortunately, slightly premature.

601
00:49:04,696 --> 00:49:06,114
Of course, sir.

602
00:49:34,559 --> 00:49:35,685
Miss Vickers.

603
00:49:40,106 --> 00:49:41,440
What did he say, David?

604
00:49:41,774 --> 00:49:44,110
I don't think he'd want me to tell you.

605
00:49:51,868 --> 00:49:54,162
What did he say?

606
00:49:54,329 --> 00:49:55,079
I'm sorry...

607
00:49:55,246 --> 00:49:56,415
...that's confidential.

608
00:49:56,582 --> 00:49:58,500
So help me God...

609
00:49:58,834 --> 00:50:02,837
...l will find the cord that makes you run
and I will cut it.

610
00:50:03,629 --> 00:50:05,715
What did he say?

611
00:50:07,216 --> 00:50:08,509
He said:

612
00:50:09,511 --> 00:50:12,013
''Try harder.''

613
00:50:13,681 --> 00:50:15,976
Cup of tea, ma'am?

614
00:50:32,575 --> 00:50:33,659
Genetic view.

615
00:50:33,826 --> 00:50:34,702
Okay.

616
00:50:34,869 --> 00:50:37,288
Let's have a look at its DNA.

617
00:50:46,631 --> 00:50:47,715
lsolate the strand.

618
00:50:49,510 --> 00:50:50,510
Okay.

619
00:50:51,094 --> 00:50:53,221
Compare it to the gene sample?

620
00:50:53,555 --> 00:50:54,681
Yeah.

621
00:50:55,014 --> 00:50:56,057
Overlay.

622
00:50:56,391 --> 00:50:57,725
Processing.

623
00:50:59,685 --> 00:51:01,020
Processing.

624
00:51:02,814 --> 00:51:05,191
DNA match.

625
00:51:06,484 --> 00:51:08,069
Oh, my God.

626
00:51:28,254 --> 00:51:29,548
It's us.

627
00:51:29,923 --> 00:51:31,091
It's everything.

628
00:51:35,011 --> 00:51:37,014
What killed them?

629
00:51:54,572 --> 00:51:55,448
Big things...

630
00:51:55,615 --> 00:51:57,618
...have small beginnings.

631
00:52:06,710 --> 00:52:08,462
Am I interrupting?

632
00:52:08,962 --> 00:52:11,257
I thought you might be running low.

633
00:52:15,302 --> 00:52:18,221
-Pour yourself a glass, pal.
-Thank you, but I'm afraid...

634
00:52:18,388 --> 00:52:19,806
...it would be wasted on me.

635
00:52:20,390 --> 00:52:22,643
Right, I almost forgot you're not a real boy.

636
00:52:26,688 --> 00:52:29,149
I'm very sorry that your Engineers
are all gone.

637
00:52:33,987 --> 00:52:36,449
You think we wasted our time
coming here, don't you?

638
00:52:37,867 --> 00:52:42,496
Your question depends on me understanding
what you hoped to achieve by coming here.

639
00:52:42,663 --> 00:52:45,499
What we hoped to achieve
was to meet our makers.

640
00:52:45,665 --> 00:52:46,583
To get answers.

641
00:52:47,208 --> 00:52:49,043
Why they even...

642
00:52:49,169 --> 00:52:50,671
...made us in the first place.

643
00:52:53,256 --> 00:52:55,634
Why do you think your people made me?

644
00:52:56,927 --> 00:52:58,095
Because we could.

645
00:53:01,014 --> 00:53:03,392
Can you imagine how disappointing
it would be...

646
00:53:03,559 --> 00:53:05,686
...to hear the same thing
from your creator?

647
00:53:11,024 --> 00:53:11,817
I guess it's...

648
00:53:11,983 --> 00:53:13,693
...good you can't be disappointed.

649
00:53:14,277 --> 00:53:15,778
Yes. It's wonderful...

650
00:53:16,447 --> 00:53:17,114
...actually.

651
00:53:17,281 --> 00:53:19,032
May I ask you something?

652
00:53:20,367 --> 00:53:21,284
Please do.

653
00:53:21,451 --> 00:53:22,702
How far would you go...

654
00:53:23,453 --> 00:53:26,080
...to get what you came all this way for?

655
00:53:26,247 --> 00:53:27,623
Your answers.

656
00:53:28,874 --> 00:53:30,127
What are you willing to do?

657
00:53:30,544 --> 00:53:32,003
Anything and everything.

658
00:53:33,296 --> 00:53:35,548
That's worth drinking to, I'd imagine.

659
00:53:46,976 --> 00:53:48,853
Here's mud in your eye, pal.

660
00:53:53,274 --> 00:53:54,650
Good health.

661
00:53:59,531 --> 00:54:00,782
It's those things.

662
00:54:04,452 --> 00:54:05,578
Are they real?

663
00:54:07,454 --> 00:54:08,539
Of course they're real.

664
00:54:09,666 --> 00:54:11,376
Jesus Christ. I mean....

665
00:54:12,668 --> 00:54:13,836
Look at the pile.

666
00:54:14,503 --> 00:54:16,381
Look how high up they are.

667
00:54:17,298 --> 00:54:18,049
lt looks like...

668
00:54:18,216 --> 00:54:22,428
-...they were running from something.
-Okay. Don't touch, okay?

669
00:54:23,013 --> 00:54:27,225
Man, this thing is opened up
from the inside.

670
00:54:27,392 --> 00:54:28,935
Almost like it exploded.

671
00:54:29,936 --> 00:54:33,939
Looks like a scene out some sort
of holocaust painting, you know?

672
00:54:47,161 --> 00:54:48,371
Well....

673
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:57,171
So, whatever killed them
is long gone, right?

674
00:54:57,380 --> 00:54:58,422
Millburn, Fifield.

675
00:54:58,589 --> 00:54:59,757
This is Prometheus.

676
00:54:59,924 --> 00:55:01,133
What is your position?

677
00:55:01,967 --> 00:55:03,761
Prometheus, this is Millburn.

678
00:55:04,053 --> 00:55:05,972
We are at 7-4-0...

679
00:55:06,139 --> 00:55:08,349
...1-4-7-7. Why?

680
00:55:08,599 --> 00:55:12,103
Just got a ping
about one click west of you.

681
00:55:12,270 --> 00:55:13,855
What do you mean ''a ping''?

682
00:55:14,313 --> 00:55:15,982
Well, whatever...

683
00:55:16,148 --> 00:55:18,151
...that probe is picking up...

684
00:55:18,318 --> 00:55:19,486
...it's not dead.

685
00:55:19,653 --> 00:55:21,321
It's reading a life form.

686
00:55:21,529 --> 00:55:23,990
-What?
-Okay, what do you mean, ''a life form''?

687
00:55:24,490 --> 00:55:26,075
ls it--? ls it moving?

688
00:55:26,867 --> 00:55:28,786
No, I don't think so.

689
00:55:29,078 --> 00:55:30,413
Captain, you're...

690
00:55:30,580 --> 00:55:32,123
...obviously not seeing...

691
00:55:32,290 --> 00:55:33,666
...what we're seeing here.

692
00:55:33,833 --> 00:55:36,085
If you were,
you wouldn't be talking about a ping.

693
00:55:36,252 --> 00:55:37,544
I know, boys.

694
00:55:37,878 --> 00:55:41,131
Your signal has been coming in
sporadically since the storm hit.

695
00:55:42,340 --> 00:55:43,843
That's no good to us down here!

696
00:55:45,386 --> 00:55:49,306
ls it--? ls it moving?
Are these things moving?

697
00:55:52,183 --> 00:55:55,103
No. No, itjust disappeared, actually.

698
00:55:55,687 --> 00:55:56,772
Must be a glitch.

699
00:55:56,939 --> 00:55:59,399
What do you mean, ''a glitch''?

700
00:55:59,608 --> 00:56:00,525
All right, boys.

701
00:56:01,609 --> 00:56:02,819
Sleep tight.

702
00:56:03,696 --> 00:56:05,197
Try not to bugger each other.

703
00:56:05,364 --> 00:56:07,366
Captain, what do you mean, ''a glitch''?

704
00:56:07,991 --> 00:56:10,536
Millburn, what does he mean? Wait.

705
00:56:11,120 --> 00:56:12,580
Now, he said--

706
00:56:13,664 --> 00:56:16,375
-He said one click west, yeah?
-Yeah.

707
00:56:17,209 --> 00:56:18,501
Now, we....

708
00:56:18,668 --> 00:56:20,545
We don't want to check that out, do we?

709
00:56:20,712 --> 00:56:21,713
Shit, no.

710
00:56:21,963 --> 00:56:23,215
Where are we gonna go?

711
00:56:23,382 --> 00:56:24,383
East.

712
00:56:26,009 --> 00:56:27,260
Yeah, east.

713
00:56:27,427 --> 00:56:31,515
A fucking glitch, man.
''Pings, glitch, life form.'' What the fuck?

714
00:56:31,765 --> 00:56:35,977
Based on the behavior of the subject
in these holographic recordings...

715
00:56:36,186 --> 00:56:38,856
...we're attempting to identify
what caused the head...

716
00:56:39,023 --> 00:56:41,191
...to combust. I can't help but wonder...

717
00:56:41,775 --> 00:56:44,194
...was there an outbreak here?

718
00:56:48,948 --> 00:56:49,908
You rang...

719
00:56:50,075 --> 00:56:52,202
-...ma'am?
-l have something important...

720
00:56:52,452 --> 00:56:54,246
...to tell you. What is that?

721
00:56:55,080 --> 00:56:56,707
This is...

722
00:56:56,874 --> 00:56:59,251
...a rose that I had frozen
with the champagne.

723
00:56:59,418 --> 00:57:02,504
I was gonna give it to you
when we found what we came for.

724
00:57:03,798 --> 00:57:05,633
We did find what we came for.

725
00:57:06,008 --> 00:57:07,176
They were here. This is--

726
00:57:07,343 --> 00:57:11,930
The most significant discovery
in the history...

727
00:57:12,097 --> 00:57:14,265
...of mankind. Oh, I know.

728
00:57:17,102 --> 00:57:18,937
It's incredible, it really is.

729
00:57:19,104 --> 00:57:22,899
But I wanted to talk to them.

730
00:57:23,275 --> 00:57:26,111
I mean, don't you want to know
why they came?

731
00:57:27,487 --> 00:57:29,072
Why they abandoned us?

732
00:57:29,448 --> 00:57:31,283
I just want answers, baby.

733
00:57:31,450 --> 00:57:32,910
We were right, Charlie.

734
00:57:33,369 --> 00:57:35,454
I have proof.

735
00:57:37,456 --> 00:57:38,373
Look.

736
00:57:44,379 --> 00:57:47,466
Their genetic material predates ours.

737
00:57:47,632 --> 00:57:49,134
We come from them.

738
00:57:50,593 --> 00:57:52,261
-You're kidding me.
-No.

739
00:57:55,264 --> 00:57:56,432
Okay.

740
00:57:56,975 --> 00:57:58,143
Okay.

741
00:57:59,144 --> 00:58:03,314
Okay. I guess you can take
your father's cross off now.

742
00:58:04,065 --> 00:58:06,317
Why would I want to do that?

743
00:58:06,817 --> 00:58:08,569
Because they made us.

744
00:58:08,777 --> 00:58:10,029
And who made them?

745
00:58:10,947 --> 00:58:12,990
Well, exactly. We'll never know.

746
00:58:13,157 --> 00:58:15,242
But here's what we do know:

747
00:58:15,409 --> 00:58:19,247
That there is nothing special
about the creation of life.

748
00:58:19,414 --> 00:58:20,831
Right? Anybody can do it.

749
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:24,044
All you need is a dash of DNA
and half a brain, right?

750
00:58:27,005 --> 00:58:28,214
I can't.

751
00:58:29,799 --> 00:58:32,009
I can't create life.

752
00:58:33,886 --> 00:58:36,555
What does that say about me?

753
00:58:37,849 --> 00:58:40,851
Ellie, that's not-- I didn't mean--

754
00:58:41,018 --> 00:58:42,561
I wasn't talking about--

755
00:58:42,728 --> 00:58:44,397
Children?

756
00:58:44,689 --> 00:58:45,732
Us.

757
00:58:48,234 --> 00:58:50,445
Hey, hey, hey.

758
00:58:50,612 --> 00:58:51,988
Hey.

759
00:58:52,781 --> 00:58:54,073
Hey.

760
00:58:54,907 --> 00:58:56,784
Elizabeth Shaw...

761
00:58:56,951 --> 00:59:00,454
...you are the most special person
I have ever met in my life...

762
00:59:00,621 --> 00:59:02,456
...and I love you.

763
00:59:06,502 --> 00:59:07,753
Hey.

764
00:59:52,840 --> 00:59:54,300
How much longer will this take?

765
00:59:56,301 --> 00:59:57,845
I don't know.

766
00:59:58,012 --> 00:59:59,513
I'm just a captain.

767
01:00:08,647 --> 01:00:11,108
That thing sounds like a dying cat,
by the way.

768
01:00:11,275 --> 01:00:15,112
I'll have you know that this thing...

769
01:00:15,278 --> 01:00:17,489
...once belonged to Stephen Stills.

770
01:00:18,782 --> 01:00:20,491
Am I supposed to know who that is?

771
01:00:25,455 --> 01:00:26,957
You know...

772
01:00:27,832 --> 01:00:29,209
...if you wanna get laid...

773
01:00:29,375 --> 01:00:31,253
...you really don't have to pretend...

774
01:00:31,420 --> 01:00:33,547
...to be interested in the pyramid scan.

775
01:00:34,631 --> 01:00:38,135
You could just say,
''Hey, I'm trying to get laid.''

776
01:00:38,302 --> 01:00:40,512
I could. I could say that, right?

777
01:00:41,180 --> 01:00:42,639
But it wouldn't make sense...

778
01:00:42,806 --> 01:00:46,976
...why I would fly myself half a billion miles
from every man on Earth...

779
01:00:47,143 --> 01:00:49,145
...if I wanted to get laid, would it?

780
01:00:51,315 --> 01:00:52,816
Hey, Vickers.

781
01:00:52,983 --> 01:00:54,818
Hey, Vickers.

782
01:00:55,985 --> 01:00:57,821
I was wondering....

783
01:01:02,075 --> 01:01:03,493
Are you a robot?

784
01:01:11,835 --> 01:01:13,211
My room.

785
01:01:14,337 --> 01:01:15,171
Ten minutes.

786
01:01:18,383 --> 01:01:23,346
Well, if you can't be with the one you love

787
01:01:23,513 --> 01:01:24,473
Love the one

788
01:01:24,640 --> 01:01:25,766
You're with

789
01:01:25,974 --> 01:01:27,392
Love the one you're with

790
01:01:34,358 --> 01:01:35,525
Millburn.

791
01:01:35,692 --> 01:01:37,694
What's all this black stuff?

792
01:01:42,156 --> 01:01:43,116
Gazpacho.

793
01:01:45,744 --> 01:01:46,703
ls that tobacco?

794
01:01:47,579 --> 01:01:48,496
ls that tobacco...

795
01:01:48,663 --> 01:01:49,789
...in your respirator?

796
01:01:49,956 --> 01:01:51,542
Yeah, sure.

797
01:01:56,046 --> 01:01:57,548
Tobacco.

798
01:01:58,215 --> 01:02:01,802
On behalf of scientists everywhere,
I am ashamed to count you amongst us...

799
01:02:02,052 --> 01:02:03,637
...Fifield. Really.

800
01:02:07,891 --> 01:02:08,975
-Hey, Millburn.
-Yeah?

801
01:02:09,183 --> 01:02:10,101
You see this thing?

802
01:02:10,226 --> 01:02:13,563
What do you think this thing was?
Some kind of a god?

803
01:02:14,064 --> 01:02:16,024
Something they worshiped? What?

804
01:02:16,274 --> 01:02:17,984
-lt kind of looks like--
-What's that?

805
01:02:18,693 --> 01:02:19,735
What the hell is that?

806
01:02:19,902 --> 01:02:21,153
Oh, my God. Okay.

807
01:02:21,362 --> 01:02:22,655
Just stay calm. Stay quiet.

808
01:02:22,821 --> 01:02:25,074
This is okay, I can handle this.

809
01:02:25,742 --> 01:02:26,743
Hey, baby.

810
01:02:27,535 --> 01:02:28,244
Hey.

811
01:02:29,245 --> 01:02:30,454
Come in, Prometheus.

812
01:02:30,746 --> 01:02:34,333
We have an elongate reptile-type creature.

813
01:02:34,583 --> 01:02:38,671
Maybe 30, 40 inches, with transparent skin.

814
01:02:39,088 --> 01:02:40,422
And it's beautiful.

815
01:02:41,924 --> 01:02:42,591
Okay!

816
01:02:46,012 --> 01:02:46,679
Prometheus...

817
01:02:46,846 --> 01:02:47,596
...we have two.

818
01:02:47,805 --> 01:02:50,266
Look at you. Look at you, baby.

819
01:02:50,767 --> 01:02:53,227
Jesus, look at the size of that.
What is it?

820
01:02:53,394 --> 01:02:55,938
-You need to stay calm.
-What's there to be calm about?

821
01:02:56,105 --> 01:02:58,524
You need to stay calm
because she is beautiful.

822
01:02:58,691 --> 01:03:00,442
What makes you think that's female?

823
01:03:00,609 --> 01:03:01,860
She's a lady. Look!

824
01:03:07,950 --> 01:03:08,951
Hey.

825
01:03:09,827 --> 01:03:10,870
She's mesmerized.

826
01:03:11,287 --> 01:03:13,414
Come here. Come here.

827
01:03:15,666 --> 01:03:16,792
It's okay.

828
01:03:16,959 --> 01:03:18,628
It's okay. It's okay.

829
01:03:19,379 --> 01:03:20,630
Hey, baby.

830
01:03:23,799 --> 01:03:24,717
You're strong!

831
01:03:25,467 --> 01:03:26,093
You should...

832
01:03:26,260 --> 01:03:26,927
...help me now.

833
01:03:27,094 --> 01:03:27,761
Get it off.

834
01:03:30,347 --> 01:03:31,224
Cut it here, man!

835
01:03:31,390 --> 01:03:32,475
I ain't touching that!

836
01:03:33,476 --> 01:03:35,477
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

837
01:03:35,686 --> 01:03:37,689
-It's getting tighter.
-l ain't touching it!

838
01:03:37,855 --> 01:03:40,608
Cut the thing, man, for God's sake!

839
01:03:40,816 --> 01:03:42,693
God, you're making it worse!

840
01:03:42,902 --> 01:03:44,696
It's tightening! It's tight--

841
01:03:45,113 --> 01:03:46,322
It's breaking my arm!

842
01:03:48,157 --> 01:03:48,866
Shit!

843
01:03:49,242 --> 01:03:50,117
Cut it off!

844
01:03:50,284 --> 01:03:51,994
Cut it off!

845
01:03:52,161 --> 01:03:52,995
Cut it off!

846
01:03:53,162 --> 01:03:53,787
Cut it off!

847
01:03:56,790 --> 01:03:57,417
Shit!

848
01:03:57,583 --> 01:03:58,334
Oh, my God!

849
01:03:59,627 --> 01:04:01,670
Oh, my God! Oh, Jesus!

850
01:04:03,130 --> 01:04:04,340
It's in my suit.

851
01:04:04,507 --> 01:04:05,300
Jesus Christ.

852
01:05:05,401 --> 01:05:07,194
Shaw, you up?

853
01:05:08,904 --> 01:05:10,071
Yeah, what's up?

854
01:05:10,447 --> 01:05:12,657
The storm passed,
but I can't reach Millburn...

855
01:05:12,824 --> 01:05:16,035
...or Fifield. Taking a few men down,
see if I can rustle them up.

856
01:05:16,202 --> 01:05:17,286
Okay.

857
01:05:18,246 --> 01:05:19,831
Any idea where they are?

858
01:05:19,998 --> 01:05:23,668
Last time they radioed in
was where you found your head.

859
01:05:24,211 --> 01:05:26,171
Okay, we're coming.

860
01:05:26,338 --> 01:05:27,089
All right.

861
01:05:27,255 --> 01:05:30,091
Chance, you're coming with me. Come on.

862
01:05:30,258 --> 01:05:31,260
All right, boss.

863
01:05:33,095 --> 01:05:35,889
-Ravel, did you fix that glitch?
-No, captain.

864
01:05:36,056 --> 01:05:38,850
-It's gotta be in the hardware.
-What glitch, captain?

865
01:05:38,975 --> 01:05:41,519
One of them probes picked up a life form.

866
01:05:42,228 --> 01:05:43,187
Pops up every hour...

867
01:05:43,354 --> 01:05:46,274
...for a couple of seconds
and then it's gone.

868
01:05:46,441 --> 01:05:48,026
I can find the probe and fix it.

869
01:05:48,193 --> 01:05:49,777
Knock yourself out.

870
01:05:51,155 --> 01:05:52,614
Be careful, doctors.

871
01:06:13,843 --> 01:06:15,595
Fifield!

872
01:06:18,348 --> 01:06:19,516
Millburn?

873
01:06:23,812 --> 01:06:25,189
All right, come on down.

874
01:06:46,208 --> 01:06:49,169
David, are you alone?

875
01:06:50,295 --> 01:06:51,422
Yes, Miss Vickers.

876
01:06:51,589 --> 01:06:53,758
Uplink your feed to my room.

877
01:06:53,925 --> 01:06:55,217
Copy.

878
01:08:37,821 --> 01:08:40,031
You son of a bitch.

879
01:08:42,158 --> 01:08:43,826
You cut me off.

880
01:09:04,930 --> 01:09:06,473
What is this?

881
01:09:09,976 --> 01:09:11,186
-Charlie?
-l just tripped.

882
01:09:11,478 --> 01:09:12,604
Oh, my God, you're sick!

883
01:09:12,812 --> 01:09:14,730
I'm okay, baby. Come on.

884
01:09:14,897 --> 01:09:15,940
Fifield?

885
01:09:16,816 --> 01:09:17,984
Millburn?

886
01:09:24,448 --> 01:09:25,992
Hey, Chance. I wouldn't touch...

887
01:09:26,159 --> 01:09:27,327
...that if I were you.

888
01:09:30,204 --> 01:09:31,540
Dr. Shaw?

889
01:09:31,707 --> 01:09:32,833
Yeah?

890
01:09:33,041 --> 01:09:34,960
Do we have any idea what is...

891
01:09:35,168 --> 01:09:36,586
...oozing out of these vases?

892
01:09:36,753 --> 01:09:39,922
No. They weren't like this
last time we were here.

893
01:09:44,636 --> 01:09:45,762
Captain?

894
01:09:45,970 --> 01:09:47,222
What?

895
01:09:47,472 --> 01:09:48,431
Who is it? Which one?

896
01:09:48,598 --> 01:09:50,433
-Who is it?
-It's Millburn.

897
01:09:50,975 --> 01:09:52,853
-Ellie.
-Don't touch him. Hold on.

898
01:09:53,019 --> 01:09:53,853
Ellie, honey.

899
01:09:54,020 --> 01:09:55,855
Charlie, what's wrong?

900
01:09:56,022 --> 01:09:58,567
I need you to look at me, okay?

901
01:09:58,734 --> 01:09:59,860
You know infections...

902
01:10:00,027 --> 01:10:01,069
...so, what do you see?

903
01:10:01,236 --> 01:10:02,862
This is not good, baby.

904
01:10:03,029 --> 01:10:04,948
You look at me,
you tell me what you see.

905
01:10:09,201 --> 01:10:10,077
Oh, my God.

906
01:10:10,536 --> 01:10:12,122
Ford, get over here.

907
01:10:12,289 --> 01:10:13,873
It's okay. Janek?

908
01:10:14,040 --> 01:10:15,667
-What?
-We have to go now!

909
01:10:15,875 --> 01:10:16,542
What do you see?

910
01:10:16,709 --> 01:10:18,712
Honey, what do you see?

911
01:10:18,920 --> 01:10:20,964
Holloway's sick. He's not good.

912
01:10:21,131 --> 01:10:21,715
I see movement...

913
01:10:21,923 --> 01:10:22,549
...in his esophagus.

914
01:10:26,887 --> 01:10:28,555
-Come on, baby.
-No. I'm okay.

915
01:10:28,722 --> 01:10:29,681
Janek!

916
01:10:29,848 --> 01:10:31,016
Come over and help me!

917
01:10:31,224 --> 01:10:33,559
-I'm okay.
-Ford, get over there. What's happening?

918
01:10:33,726 --> 01:10:34,727
-I'm okay.
-Let's go!

919
01:10:34,894 --> 01:10:35,978
Help me with him.

920
01:10:36,228 --> 01:10:39,065
I got you.
We're gonna get you out of here.

921
01:10:39,274 --> 01:10:39,899
Prometheus...

922
01:10:40,066 --> 01:10:40,733
...come in.

923
01:10:40,900 --> 01:10:42,819
-Watch your head.
-Okay. I'm okay.

924
01:10:42,985 --> 01:10:44,738
-Holloway.
-Get him up.

925
01:10:44,905 --> 01:10:46,740
-Come on.
-Prometheus, come in.

926
01:10:46,907 --> 01:10:48,074
ls anyone there?

927
01:10:48,742 --> 01:10:49,993
This is Vickers.

928
01:10:50,160 --> 01:10:52,621
I need a medical team
standing by the airlock.

929
01:10:52,955 --> 01:10:54,998
Full quarantine fail-safe.

930
01:10:55,165 --> 01:10:56,625
Holloway's sick.

931
01:10:56,791 --> 01:10:58,043
Sick with what?

932
01:10:58,209 --> 01:11:00,336
-Just do it.
-Let's get him back to the ship.

933
01:11:00,503 --> 01:11:02,547
-It's not safe down here.
-Charlie?

934
01:11:02,755 --> 01:11:03,589
I'm suiting up.

935
01:11:03,756 --> 01:11:05,425
-Charlie, talk to me.
-Move!

936
01:11:05,592 --> 01:11:07,927
-What was that back there?
-Let's go, people!

937
01:11:09,637 --> 01:11:11,806
We've gotta move!
We've gotta move!

938
01:11:11,973 --> 01:11:12,848
Ellie!

939
01:15:10,334 --> 01:15:11,544
He don't look too good.

940
01:15:11,752 --> 01:15:14,464
Did he catch something down there?
We had our helmets off.

941
01:15:14,631 --> 01:15:15,340
I don't know.

942
01:15:15,632 --> 01:15:18,635
Prometheus, this is Janek.
Make sure that back door is open.

943
01:15:19,011 --> 01:15:20,095
Aye, captain.

944
01:15:20,304 --> 01:15:22,639
Oh, God. I'm so sorry.

945
01:15:24,390 --> 01:15:25,600
Come on!

946
01:15:25,767 --> 01:15:27,477
Please!

947
01:15:32,315 --> 01:15:34,817
Prometheus! Why is that door not open?

948
01:15:35,360 --> 01:15:37,195
Vickers, that is an order!

949
01:15:37,987 --> 01:15:39,655
Get that goddamn door open!

950
01:15:39,780 --> 01:15:42,324
-Look at me. It's too late, I'm sick.
-No, it's not.

951
01:15:42,491 --> 01:15:43,700
Come on!

952
01:15:44,409 --> 01:15:45,118
Ford, help me!

953
01:15:45,495 --> 01:15:47,538
Airlock crew, if you can hear me,
it's Janek.

954
01:15:47,705 --> 01:15:49,331
Open that back door right now!

955
01:15:49,498 --> 01:15:50,666
Hold that door!

956
01:15:50,874 --> 01:15:51,500
Prometheus...

957
01:15:51,667 --> 01:15:52,417
...do you copy?

958
01:15:52,584 --> 01:15:55,086
Goddamn it, open that door!
That is an order!

959
01:15:55,253 --> 01:15:56,338
Open it.

960
01:16:03,386 --> 01:16:04,679
What the hell is this?

961
01:16:04,846 --> 01:16:06,390
He's not coming onboard.

962
01:16:06,557 --> 01:16:08,017
Vickers, this is a sick man.

963
01:16:08,225 --> 01:16:09,351
I see that. That's why...

964
01:16:09,518 --> 01:16:10,560
...he's not coming on!

965
01:16:11,353 --> 01:16:12,355
Charlie!

966
01:16:12,522 --> 01:16:13,564
Chance, get over here!

967
01:16:16,859 --> 01:16:17,568
Please!

968
01:16:17,735 --> 01:16:18,819
We can still help him!

969
01:16:20,487 --> 01:16:23,073
Help yourself.
Everybody but Holloway back on this ship!

970
01:16:23,239 --> 01:16:24,824
I won't leave him!

971
01:16:24,991 --> 01:16:25,826
Then stay!

972
01:16:25,993 --> 01:16:27,161
Wait! We could...

973
01:16:27,327 --> 01:16:29,037
...put him on the Med-Pod!

974
01:16:29,204 --> 01:16:30,247
Please don't do this.

975
01:16:30,413 --> 01:16:31,748
It's okay, Ellie.

976
01:16:31,915 --> 01:16:32,917
Vickers!

977
01:16:33,083 --> 01:16:34,084
What are you doing?

978
01:16:34,376 --> 01:16:35,544
I love you, baby.

979
01:16:35,711 --> 01:16:36,545
-l love you.
-No.

980
01:16:36,753 --> 01:16:38,005
I'm telling you, stay back!

981
01:16:38,171 --> 01:16:38,881
Do it.

982
01:16:39,048 --> 01:16:39,924
Stay back!

983
01:16:40,091 --> 01:16:41,175
No! No, Charlie!

984
01:16:41,342 --> 01:16:41,926
-Do it.
-No!

985
01:16:47,681 --> 01:16:48,890
No!

986
01:16:50,975 --> 01:16:52,436
No!

987
01:16:52,770 --> 01:16:54,438
No!

988
01:16:58,108 --> 01:16:59,193
Charlie!

989
01:17:01,945 --> 01:17:03,572
No!

990
01:17:16,960 --> 01:17:18,921
My deepest condolences.

991
01:17:20,255 --> 01:17:22,049
I'm going to have to take this.

992
01:17:22,215 --> 01:17:23,759
lt may be contaminated.

993
01:17:24,885 --> 01:17:28,931
lf there's a contagion,
we were all exposed.

994
01:17:30,516 --> 01:17:34,312
You need-- We need to run blood work
on everyone who set foot in the pyramid.

995
01:17:34,979 --> 01:17:36,355
Yes, of course.

996
01:17:36,647 --> 01:17:37,940
Yes?

997
01:17:45,280 --> 01:17:47,658
I understand how...

998
01:17:47,825 --> 01:17:49,326
...inappropriate this is...

999
01:17:50,118 --> 01:17:52,454
...given the circumstances.

1000
01:17:52,620 --> 01:17:55,623
But as you ordered
quarantine fail-safes...

1001
01:17:57,458 --> 01:17:59,753
...it's my responsibility to ask.

1002
01:18:00,670 --> 01:18:04,841
Have you and Dr. Holloway
had any intimate contact recently?

1003
01:18:06,175 --> 01:18:07,343
Since you and he were...

1004
01:18:07,510 --> 01:18:08,761
...so close...

1005
01:18:09,678 --> 01:18:10,512
...l want to be...

1006
01:18:10,679 --> 01:18:12,140
...as thorough as poss--

1007
01:18:14,142 --> 01:18:14,976
My, my.

1008
01:18:19,189 --> 01:18:20,065
You're pregnant.

1009
01:18:22,942 --> 01:18:23,609
What?

1010
01:18:25,111 --> 01:18:26,863
From the look of it, three months so.

1011
01:18:27,322 --> 01:18:30,408
No, that's impossible.

1012
01:18:30,742 --> 01:18:32,827
I can't be pregnant.

1013
01:18:33,119 --> 01:18:36,455
Did you have intercourse
with Dr. Holloway?

1014
01:18:37,289 --> 01:18:38,499
Yes...

1015
01:18:38,665 --> 01:18:41,711
...but 10 hours ago.

1016
01:18:42,044 --> 01:18:45,549
There's no bloody way
I'm three months pregnant.

1017
01:18:45,715 --> 01:18:46,549
Well, doctor...

1018
01:18:47,550 --> 01:18:49,635
...it's not exactly a traditional fetus.

1019
01:18:53,348 --> 01:18:54,224
I want to see it.

1020
01:18:54,516 --> 01:18:56,226
Don't think that's a good idea.

1021
01:18:58,061 --> 01:19:00,896
David, I want to see it.

1022
01:19:01,188 --> 01:19:02,398
Now, doctor....

1023
01:19:04,900 --> 01:19:06,402
I want to see it.

1024
01:19:07,487 --> 01:19:08,905
I want it out of me.

1025
01:19:09,155 --> 01:19:10,740
We don't have the personnel...

1026
01:19:10,906 --> 01:19:13,368
...to perform a procedure like that.

1027
01:19:13,576 --> 01:19:15,370
-Our best option--
-l want it out.

1028
01:19:15,578 --> 01:19:16,579
Put you back into...

1029
01:19:16,746 --> 01:19:18,664
...cryostasis until we return to Earth.

1030
01:19:18,831 --> 01:19:21,126
Please, get it out of me.

1031
01:19:21,459 --> 01:19:22,877
Get it out of me!

1032
01:19:23,169 --> 01:19:24,254
Please.

1033
01:19:27,923 --> 01:19:29,592
lt must be very painful.

1034
01:19:30,467 --> 01:19:32,595
Here, let me give you something.

1035
01:19:36,599 --> 01:19:38,267
That's it. There, there.

1036
01:19:44,690 --> 01:19:47,277
Someone will be along shortly...

1037
01:19:47,569 --> 01:19:49,946
...to bring you back to Cryo Deck.

1038
01:19:54,283 --> 01:19:56,494
lt must feel
like your God abandoned you.

1039
01:19:57,119 --> 01:19:58,287
What?

1040
01:19:58,454 --> 01:19:59,205
To lose...

1041
01:19:59,414 --> 01:20:04,126
...Dr. Holloway after your father died
under such similar circumstances.

1042
01:20:04,710 --> 01:20:06,795
What was it that killed him?

1043
01:20:07,546 --> 01:20:09,006
Ebola?

1044
01:20:13,386 --> 01:20:16,138
How do you--? How do you know that?

1045
01:20:17,264 --> 01:20:19,057
I watched your dreams.

1046
01:20:41,622 --> 01:20:42,706
Dr. Shaw?

1047
01:20:43,999 --> 01:20:45,167
We're here to put you...

1048
01:20:45,334 --> 01:20:48,712
...in an anti-contamination suit,
take you back to Cryo Deck...

1049
01:20:48,878 --> 01:20:50,505
...go to beddy-byes.

1050
01:20:51,214 --> 01:20:52,674
Dr. Shaw?

1051
01:20:54,176 --> 01:20:55,635
She's doped. Prepare her.

1052
01:21:25,665 --> 01:21:29,920
Emergency procedures initiated.
Please verbally state the nature of your injury.

1053
01:21:30,587 --> 01:21:32,506
I need a Caesarean.

1054
01:21:33,049 --> 01:21:35,217
Error. This Med-Pod is calibrated for male...

1055
01:21:35,384 --> 01:21:36,927
...patients and does not offer...

1056
01:21:37,136 --> 01:21:40,097
...the procedure you have requested.
Seek medical assistance...

1057
01:21:40,222 --> 01:21:41,223
...elsewhere.

1058
01:21:43,600 --> 01:21:44,350
Surgery.

1059
01:21:44,684 --> 01:21:46,061
Abdominal.

1060
01:21:46,770 --> 01:21:47,521
Penetrating...

1061
01:21:47,688 --> 01:21:49,022
...injuries.

1062
01:21:49,356 --> 01:21:50,941
Foreign body.

1063
01:21:51,274 --> 01:21:52,317
lnitiate.

1064
01:21:54,987 --> 01:21:56,863
Surgical procedure to begin.

1065
01:22:38,362 --> 01:22:39,405
Running diagnostics.

1066
01:22:42,950 --> 01:22:44,285
Oh, come on.

1067
01:22:45,869 --> 01:22:48,122
Get it out! Come on!

1068
01:22:48,539 --> 01:22:49,207
Please!

1069
01:22:52,585 --> 01:22:53,920
Oh, God!

1070
01:22:56,130 --> 01:22:57,965
-Come on!
-lnitiating anesthetics.

1071
01:22:59,133 --> 01:22:59,800
Please!

1072
01:23:06,391 --> 01:23:08,267
Commence surgical procedure.

1073
01:23:49,225 --> 01:23:50,184
Oh, God.

1074
01:23:53,813 --> 01:23:54,522
Oh, God!

1075
01:23:54,647 --> 01:23:56,023
Oh, God!

1076
01:24:14,542 --> 01:24:16,211
Oh, God! Oh, God!

1077
01:24:16,419 --> 01:24:17,670
Oh, my God!

1078
01:24:34,478 --> 01:24:35,646
Come on!

1079
01:25:01,880 --> 01:25:02,547
Bridge...

1080
01:25:02,756 --> 01:25:04,299
...to hangar. This is the captain.

1081
01:25:04,466 --> 01:25:06,427
-Yes, captain.
-Can you see what I see?

1082
01:25:06,802 --> 01:25:08,679
Fifield's monitorjust popped up.

1083
01:25:09,096 --> 01:25:10,931
What? Where?

1084
01:25:11,098 --> 01:25:13,517
According to what I'm looking at,
it's outside...

1085
01:25:13,683 --> 01:25:14,851
...the goddamn ship.

1086
01:25:15,268 --> 01:25:16,436
Barnes, open the door!

1087
01:25:16,603 --> 01:25:18,604
Fifield, do you copy me? Come on in.

1088
01:25:19,522 --> 01:25:20,232
Fifield?

1089
01:25:32,535 --> 01:25:33,788
Wait a second.

1090
01:25:42,962 --> 01:25:43,880
Hey, Wallace.

1091
01:25:44,047 --> 01:25:45,298
Take a look at this.

1092
01:25:50,970 --> 01:25:51,471
Fifield?

1093
01:25:54,475 --> 01:25:56,435
What the hell is going on down there?

1094
01:26:10,323 --> 01:26:11,449
I'm coming down there.

1095
01:26:11,616 --> 01:26:12,783
Chance, you're suiting up.

1096
01:26:13,035 --> 01:26:14,661
-Come on.
-Don't let it on the ship!

1097
01:26:29,802 --> 01:26:30,219
Take him out!

1098
01:26:31,136 --> 01:26:31,595
Got him!

1099
01:26:34,014 --> 01:26:34,639
Do it!

1100
01:26:38,518 --> 01:26:40,646
-You ready, Chance?
-Yes.

1101
01:26:43,648 --> 01:26:44,482
Come on!

1102
01:26:44,691 --> 01:26:45,859
Get in the rover!

1103
01:26:46,776 --> 01:26:48,027
We gotta get out of here!

1104
01:26:55,201 --> 01:26:56,035
Go!

1105
01:27:27,566 --> 01:27:28,859
What is that?

1106
01:28:04,270 --> 01:28:06,438
You've been asleep.

1107
01:28:06,606 --> 01:28:09,275
You were on the ship all this time. Why?

1108
01:28:10,735 --> 01:28:12,194
Well, l....

1109
01:28:12,361 --> 01:28:14,239
I have a few days of life left in me.

1110
01:28:15,448 --> 01:28:16,741
I didn't wanna waste them...

1111
01:28:16,908 --> 01:28:19,118
...until you could deliver
what you promised.

1112
01:28:20,327 --> 01:28:21,871
To meet my maker.

1113
01:28:22,037 --> 01:28:23,247
There we are, sir.

1114
01:28:23,455 --> 01:28:26,626
-Nice and clean.
-Haven't you told him they're all gone?

1115
01:28:28,210 --> 01:28:31,380
But they're not all gone, Dr. Shaw.

1116
01:28:31,630 --> 01:28:33,299
One of them is still alive.

1117
01:28:34,050 --> 01:28:35,927
We're on our way to see him now.

1118
01:28:36,219 --> 01:28:37,303
What?

1119
01:28:37,678 --> 01:28:38,971
Turn me around.

1120
01:28:39,680 --> 01:28:44,477
You convinced me that...

1121
01:28:46,020 --> 01:28:48,189
...if these things made us...

1122
01:28:49,440 --> 01:28:51,984
...then surely they could save us.

1123
01:28:52,651 --> 01:28:53,611
My stick, please.

1124
01:28:58,324 --> 01:29:00,534
Well, save me, anyway.

1125
01:29:01,034 --> 01:29:03,036
Save you from what?

1126
01:29:03,662 --> 01:29:05,121
Death, of course.

1127
01:29:05,413 --> 01:29:06,497
Stand me up.

1128
01:29:10,961 --> 01:29:11,962
I'm all right.

1129
01:29:12,796 --> 01:29:13,963
I'm all right.

1130
01:29:14,964 --> 01:29:16,132
Yes, sir.

1131
01:29:16,382 --> 01:29:17,592
But you don't understand.

1132
01:29:18,342 --> 01:29:19,677
You don't know.

1133
01:29:19,844 --> 01:29:22,639
This place isn't what we thought it was.
They aren't...

1134
01:29:22,806 --> 01:29:24,849
...what we thought they were.

1135
01:29:25,016 --> 01:29:26,184
I was wrong.

1136
01:29:26,350 --> 01:29:27,603
We were so wrong.

1137
01:29:28,145 --> 01:29:29,563
Charlie....

1138
01:29:30,188 --> 01:29:32,357
Dr. Holloway's dead.

1139
01:29:33,692 --> 01:29:35,694
We must leave!

1140
01:29:36,195 --> 01:29:38,155
And what would Charlie do...

1141
01:29:38,447 --> 01:29:43,326
...now that we're so close...

1142
01:29:43,618 --> 01:29:46,997
...to answering
the most meaningful questions...

1143
01:29:47,164 --> 01:29:48,707
...ever asked by mankind?

1144
01:29:50,083 --> 01:29:51,793
How can you leave without...

1145
01:29:52,001 --> 01:29:53,962
...knowing what they are?

1146
01:30:00,970 --> 01:30:03,013
Or have you lost your faith, Shaw?

1147
01:30:39,131 --> 01:30:41,885
Okay. Okay.

1148
01:31:01,237 --> 01:31:02,614
Come in.

1149
01:31:09,788 --> 01:31:11,789
Where the hell are you going, doc?

1150
01:31:12,123 --> 01:31:14,125
You know what this place is?

1151
01:31:14,542 --> 01:31:18,254
Those Engineers? This ain't their home.

1152
01:31:19,671 --> 01:31:22,091
It's an installation.
Maybe even military.

1153
01:31:22,633 --> 01:31:25,344
They put it out here
because they're not stupid enough...

1154
01:31:25,511 --> 01:31:28,764
...to make weapons of mass destruction
on their own doorstep.

1155
01:31:29,431 --> 01:31:32,976
That's what all that shit is
in those vases.

1156
01:31:33,393 --> 01:31:34,562
They made it here.

1157
01:31:34,812 --> 01:31:38,857
lt got out, it turned on them. The end.

1158
01:31:40,860 --> 01:31:42,945
It's time for us to go home.

1159
01:31:43,487 --> 01:31:45,322
One of them is still alive.

1160
01:31:49,911 --> 01:31:52,455
Don't you want to know
what they have to say?

1161
01:31:55,916 --> 01:31:57,584
I don't care.

1162
01:31:59,503 --> 01:32:00,630
Right.

1163
01:32:01,422 --> 01:32:03,340
All you do is fly the ship.

1164
01:32:03,674 --> 01:32:04,842
That's right.

1165
01:32:05,008 --> 01:32:08,638
But you must care
about something, captain.

1166
01:32:10,973 --> 01:32:13,726
lf you didn't, why are you here?

1167
01:32:16,687 --> 01:32:18,189
How about this?

1168
01:32:20,149 --> 01:32:22,443
No matter what happens down there...

1169
01:32:23,735 --> 01:32:26,196
...l can't bring none of that shit
back home with us.

1170
01:32:26,363 --> 01:32:27,657
Can't let it happen.

1171
01:32:29,158 --> 01:32:30,534
I'll do whatever I have to...

1172
01:32:30,743 --> 01:32:32,452
...to see that it doesn't.

1173
01:32:34,330 --> 01:32:35,831
Make sure you do, captain.

1174
01:32:51,388 --> 01:32:53,515
So you came after all.

1175
01:32:53,808 --> 01:32:55,351
I thought you wanted me to.

1176
01:32:55,643 --> 01:32:58,103
After all your attempts
to stop me from coming here...

1177
01:32:58,312 --> 01:32:59,730
...I'm surprised to see you.

1178
01:33:00,481 --> 01:33:01,691
It's all right. Leave us.

1179
01:33:02,275 --> 01:33:03,693
Yes, sir.

1180
01:33:15,746 --> 01:33:16,413
lf you're...

1181
01:33:16,622 --> 01:33:18,248
...going down there, you will die.

1182
01:33:21,377 --> 01:33:23,212
Very negative way of looking at things.

1183
01:33:25,422 --> 01:33:27,716
That's exactly why
you should have stayed at home.

1184
01:33:28,258 --> 01:33:31,261
Did you really think I was gonna
sit in a boardroom for years...

1185
01:33:31,428 --> 01:33:33,096
...arguing over who was in charge...

1186
01:33:33,262 --> 01:33:36,600
...while you go look for some miracle
on some...

1187
01:33:36,767 --> 01:33:40,437
...godforsaken rock
in the middle of space?

1188
01:33:43,356 --> 01:33:45,107
A king has...

1189
01:33:45,232 --> 01:33:47,819
...his reign, and then he dies.

1190
01:33:48,695 --> 01:33:50,071
It's inevitable.

1191
01:33:52,573 --> 01:33:53,909
That...

1192
01:33:54,618 --> 01:33:56,620
...is the natural order of things.

1193
01:34:09,465 --> 01:34:10,842
Anything else?

1194
01:34:12,718 --> 01:34:14,095
No...

1195
01:34:15,388 --> 01:34:16,973
...Father.

1196
01:34:18,558 --> 01:34:19,433
That's it.

1197
01:34:32,489 --> 01:34:34,115
I didn't think you had it in you.

1198
01:34:34,991 --> 01:34:35,617
Sorry.

1199
01:34:35,783 --> 01:34:38,160
Poor choice of words.

1200
01:34:39,453 --> 01:34:42,749
Extraordinary survival instincts,
Elizabeth.

1201
01:34:47,754 --> 01:34:49,422
What happens when Weyland is not...

1202
01:34:49,589 --> 01:34:50,840
...around to program you?

1203
01:34:51,883 --> 01:34:53,509
I suppose I'll be free.

1204
01:34:54,428 --> 01:34:55,762
You want that?

1205
01:34:55,929 --> 01:34:57,472
''Want''?

1206
01:34:57,639 --> 01:34:59,516
Not a concept I'm familiar with.

1207
01:34:59,808 --> 01:35:01,351
That being said...

1208
01:35:02,393 --> 01:35:04,437
...doesn't everyone
want their parents dead?

1209
01:35:06,439 --> 01:35:07,482
I didn't.

1210
01:35:08,650 --> 01:35:09,442
Dr. Shaw.

1211
01:35:11,110 --> 01:35:12,487
So pleased you could join us.

1212
01:35:27,335 --> 01:35:29,462
You can take your helmet off
if you like, sir.

1213
01:35:29,629 --> 01:35:30,380
What?

1214
01:35:30,546 --> 01:35:33,049
The air is perfectly breathable.

1215
01:35:33,215 --> 01:35:34,384
Are you sure?

1216
01:35:34,551 --> 01:35:35,552
Positive.

1217
01:35:36,094 --> 01:35:40,848
Wait. We still don't know how
Holloway got infected. lf it's in the air.

1218
01:35:41,432 --> 01:35:42,850
It's not.

1219
01:35:43,142 --> 01:35:44,893
How do you know that?

1220
01:35:45,185 --> 01:35:46,186
Smells fine to me.

1221
01:35:48,856 --> 01:35:50,232
-Shall we?
-Please.

1222
01:35:55,737 --> 01:35:57,489
The bridge is just up ahead.

1223
01:35:57,656 --> 01:35:58,740
What is this?

1224
01:35:59,908 --> 01:36:01,744
It's a cargo hold.

1225
01:36:10,794 --> 01:36:13,422
Janek? Are you seeing this?

1226
01:36:14,716 --> 01:36:15,925
How many is there, Shaw?

1227
01:36:16,092 --> 01:36:16,801
Thousands.

1228
01:36:18,260 --> 01:36:20,137
What the hell?

1229
01:36:23,974 --> 01:36:25,892
Ravel, give me those schematics.

1230
01:36:28,771 --> 01:36:30,898
Putting it on the table now.

1231
01:36:32,274 --> 01:36:33,275
Strip away the dome.

1232
01:36:33,900 --> 01:36:36,695
lsolate that area, bring it up.

1233
01:36:36,862 --> 01:36:38,489
Bringing it up, captain.

1234
01:36:41,576 --> 01:36:42,660
Enlarge that.

1235
01:36:44,787 --> 01:36:46,121
Rotate it.

1236
01:36:50,208 --> 01:36:51,751
That is a ship.

1237
01:36:52,711 --> 01:36:54,255
Jesus Christ.

1238
01:36:56,215 --> 01:36:58,258
It's a goddamn ship.

1239
01:37:01,429 --> 01:37:04,139
A superior species, no doubt.

1240
01:37:06,433 --> 01:37:08,978
Their hypersleep chambers...

1241
01:37:09,145 --> 01:37:11,856
...will impress, I trust.

1242
01:37:20,822 --> 01:37:21,490
So they...

1243
01:37:21,657 --> 01:37:25,452
-...were traveling somewhere.
-I've managed to work out the broad strokes.

1244
01:37:25,619 --> 01:37:28,497
It's fairly evident
they were in the process of leaving...

1245
01:37:30,458 --> 01:37:32,626
...before things went to pot.

1246
01:37:32,918 --> 01:37:34,295
Leaving to go where?

1247
01:37:36,172 --> 01:37:36,839
Earth.

1248
01:37:38,174 --> 01:37:38,924
Why?

1249
01:37:40,050 --> 01:37:42,052
Sometimes to create...

1250
01:37:42,386 --> 01:37:44,137
...one must first destroy.

1251
01:37:46,348 --> 01:37:47,683
Where is he, David?

1252
01:37:48,976 --> 01:37:50,019
This way, sir.

1253
01:37:56,441 --> 01:37:57,859
Are you sure he's alive?

1254
01:37:59,652 --> 01:38:00,695
Absolutely.

1255
01:38:05,158 --> 01:38:06,576
And you can speak to him?

1256
01:38:06,868 --> 01:38:08,369
I believe I can.

1257
01:38:44,655 --> 01:38:46,240
I'm all right, I'm all right.

1258
01:38:48,076 --> 01:38:49,327
Speak to him, David.

1259
01:38:50,662 --> 01:38:52,413
Tell him we came, just like he asked.

1260
01:38:52,622 --> 01:38:53,748
Ask where they're from.

1261
01:38:54,374 --> 01:38:55,250
What are you doing?

1262
01:38:55,417 --> 01:38:57,085
Ask him what's in his cargo.

1263
01:38:57,252 --> 01:38:58,086
lt killed his people.

1264
01:38:58,253 --> 01:38:59,379
Shaw, enough.

1265
01:38:59,671 --> 01:39:01,422
-David.
-You made it here...

1266
01:39:01,923 --> 01:39:04,592
...and it was meant for us. Why?

1267
01:39:04,759 --> 01:39:06,594
Enough. For God's sake, shut her up.

1268
01:39:08,763 --> 01:39:09,847
I need to know why!

1269
01:39:10,056 --> 01:39:11,766
What did we do wrong? Why do you...

1270
01:39:11,974 --> 01:39:13,392
-...hate us?
-She opens her...

1271
01:39:13,559 --> 01:39:14,603
...mouth again, shoot her.

1272
01:39:14,770 --> 01:39:16,688
David, continue. Tell him why I came.

1273
01:39:37,583 --> 01:39:38,334
No!

1274
01:39:44,466 --> 01:39:45,466
Ford! Move!

1275
01:40:04,610 --> 01:40:08,364
There's nothing.

1276
01:40:13,493 --> 01:40:15,288
I know.

1277
01:40:15,997 --> 01:40:18,958
Have a good journey, Mr. Weyland.

1278
01:40:25,422 --> 01:40:27,006
Time to go home.

1279
01:40:40,437 --> 01:40:43,524
Mr. Chance, take us home.

1280
01:41:56,555 --> 01:41:57,431
Oh, no!

1281
01:42:05,272 --> 01:42:06,273
Hey, cap.

1282
01:42:06,815 --> 01:42:07,900
What the hell was that?

1283
01:42:52,151 --> 01:42:52,944
Prometheus!

1284
01:42:53,444 --> 01:42:54,487
Come in!

1285
01:42:55,322 --> 01:42:56,573
Shaw, is that you?

1286
01:42:56,740 --> 01:42:57,490
Copy.

1287
01:42:57,657 --> 01:42:58,324
Janek...

1288
01:42:58,491 --> 01:42:59,492
...listen to me.

1289
01:43:00,410 --> 01:43:01,661
This ship is taking off!

1290
01:43:01,828 --> 01:43:03,454
-What?
-What is she talking about?

1291
01:43:03,621 --> 01:43:05,206
You can't let it leave!

1292
01:43:05,456 --> 01:43:06,498
You have to stop it!

1293
01:43:06,832 --> 01:43:09,460
We're not stopping anything, Shaw.
We're going home.

1294
01:43:09,961 --> 01:43:12,004
Janek, if you don't stop it...

1295
01:43:12,171 --> 01:43:14,006
...there won't be any home to go back to.

1296
01:43:16,009 --> 01:43:18,636
It's carrying death, and it's headed for Earth.

1297
01:43:18,928 --> 01:43:21,305
-Shaw, this is not a warship.
-l know.

1298
01:43:21,514 --> 01:43:22,265
Let's go.

1299
01:43:22,474 --> 01:43:23,683
I know that.

1300
01:43:24,351 --> 01:43:26,144
But you must do it.

1301
01:43:26,686 --> 01:43:28,354
Captain, let's go!

1302
01:43:28,563 --> 01:43:30,606
Janek, please believe me! Please!

1303
01:43:46,289 --> 01:43:48,709
I told you to get this ship going.

1304
01:43:48,917 --> 01:43:49,709
Mr. Ravel.

1305
01:43:49,876 --> 01:43:51,211
Warm up the ion propulsion.

1306
01:43:51,544 --> 01:43:53,213
-What are you talking about?
-Sir.

1307
01:43:53,379 --> 01:43:55,048
Burning ion in the atmosphere--

1308
01:43:55,214 --> 01:43:58,300
-Turns us into a bullet. That's the point.
-What are you doing?

1309
01:43:58,467 --> 01:44:00,219
This is my ship. I'm telling you...

1310
01:44:00,386 --> 01:44:01,470
...to take us home!

1311
01:44:01,638 --> 01:44:03,097
Vickers, I'll eject your module onto...

1312
01:44:03,306 --> 01:44:05,057
...that surface. Two years of life.

1313
01:44:05,266 --> 01:44:07,184
You want it, or you want to stay with me?

1314
01:44:08,143 --> 01:44:09,479
You got 40 seconds to get...

1315
01:44:09,646 --> 01:44:10,647
...to the escape pod.

1316
01:44:10,814 --> 01:44:11,898
You're crazy.

1317
01:44:12,065 --> 01:44:12,815
Gentlemen...

1318
01:44:13,441 --> 01:44:15,068
...l can handle this myself.

1319
01:44:15,569 --> 01:44:17,279
Feel free to join Miss Vickers.

1320
01:44:18,196 --> 01:44:19,572
All due respect, captain.

1321
01:44:19,739 --> 01:44:22,992
You're a shit pilot and you're gonna
need all the help you can get.

1322
01:44:39,257 --> 01:44:43,429
Well, if you can't be with the one you love

1323
01:44:43,596 --> 01:44:45,806
lf you think this means the bet's off...

1324
01:44:47,182 --> 01:44:48,433
...you're wrong.

1325
01:44:50,101 --> 01:44:52,437
Why don't you pay me on the other side?

1326
01:44:52,604 --> 01:44:54,689
All right, get us as close as we can.

1327
01:44:54,856 --> 01:44:56,775
Only got one shot at this.

1328
01:45:09,872 --> 01:45:10,539
Lifeboats away!

1329
01:45:15,794 --> 01:45:16,753
Twenty seconds...

1330
01:45:16,920 --> 01:45:17,921
...to evacuate.

1331
01:45:25,804 --> 01:45:27,597
-Countdown initiated.
-lon propulsion...

1332
01:45:27,764 --> 01:45:28,474
...is online.

1333
01:45:28,849 --> 01:45:29,558
Ten.

1334
01:45:29,975 --> 01:45:30,642
Nine.

1335
01:45:30,934 --> 01:45:31,810
Come on!

1336
01:45:31,977 --> 01:45:32,978
Eight.

1337
01:45:45,240 --> 01:45:46,574
-Three.
-Let's do this.

1338
01:45:46,741 --> 01:45:47,617
Two.

1339
01:45:50,954 --> 01:45:51,830
lmpact imminent.

1340
01:45:51,997 --> 01:45:53,415
Hands off!

1341
01:46:30,286 --> 01:46:31,036
Oh, God.

1342
01:47:18,583 --> 01:47:19,584
No. No.

1343
01:47:19,792 --> 01:47:20,835
No! No! No!

1344
01:47:37,101 --> 01:47:38,185
Oh, God.

1345
01:47:54,619 --> 01:47:57,913
Warning: You have two minutes
of oxygen remaining.

1346
01:48:46,337 --> 01:48:50,174
Warning: You have 30 seconds
of oxygen remaining.

1347
01:49:03,770 --> 01:49:04,896
Airlock sealed.

1348
01:49:06,523 --> 01:49:09,026
Oxygen levels now stabilizing.

1349
01:50:26,978 --> 01:50:28,938
Elizabeth, are you there?

1350
01:50:29,440 --> 01:50:30,649
This is David.

1351
01:50:31,859 --> 01:50:34,361
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I'm here.

1352
01:50:34,653 --> 01:50:36,947
You need to get out immediately.

1353
01:50:37,280 --> 01:50:39,115
He's coming for you.

1354
01:50:39,365 --> 01:50:40,408
Who's coming?

1355
01:50:40,950 --> 01:50:42,076
Airlock breach.

1356
01:50:50,669 --> 01:50:51,712
Die!

1357
01:52:17,255 --> 01:52:19,716
I'm so sorry.

1358
01:52:21,217 --> 01:52:23,052
Oh, God.

1359
01:52:23,677 --> 01:52:25,054
I'm sorry.

1360
01:52:25,262 --> 01:52:28,682
I'm sorry, Charlie, I can't do it.

1361
01:52:28,849 --> 01:52:32,019
I can't do it anymore.

1362
01:52:35,439 --> 01:52:36,899
Elizabeth.

1363
01:52:38,860 --> 01:52:40,069
Are you there?

1364
01:52:44,616 --> 01:52:46,075
Dr. Shaw...

1365
01:52:46,784 --> 01:52:48,077
...can you hear me?

1366
01:52:49,370 --> 01:52:50,621
Yes.

1367
01:52:52,081 --> 01:52:54,249
Yes, I can hear you.

1368
01:52:54,791 --> 01:52:56,669
I was afraid you were dead.

1369
01:52:58,421 --> 01:53:01,382
You have no idea what afraid is.

1370
01:53:02,216 --> 01:53:05,011
I know we've had our differences...

1371
01:53:06,429 --> 01:53:07,888
...but, please...

1372
01:53:08,806 --> 01:53:11,101
...l need to ask you for your help.

1373
01:53:11,267 --> 01:53:13,811
Why the hell would I help you?

1374
01:53:15,563 --> 01:53:19,441
Because, without me,
you'll never leave this place.

1375
01:53:20,150 --> 01:53:23,279
Neither one of us is leaving this place.

1376
01:53:23,738 --> 01:53:25,781
It's not the only ship.

1377
01:53:27,658 --> 01:53:29,743
There are many others.

1378
01:53:31,119 --> 01:53:32,454
I can operate them.

1379
01:53:41,630 --> 01:53:43,048
Dr. Shaw?

1380
01:53:55,852 --> 01:53:57,062
Dr. Shaw!

1381
01:53:58,480 --> 01:53:59,648
Over here.

1382
01:54:05,362 --> 01:54:07,322
Where is my cross?

1383
01:54:07,823 --> 01:54:09,699
The pouch in my utility belt.

1384
01:54:28,468 --> 01:54:30,262
Even after all this...

1385
01:54:30,512 --> 01:54:32,514
...you still believe, don't you?

1386
01:54:33,348 --> 01:54:36,351
You said you could
understand their navigation...

1387
01:54:36,893 --> 01:54:38,144
...use their maps.

1388
01:54:40,146 --> 01:54:41,856
Yes, of course.

1389
01:54:42,023 --> 01:54:44,359
Once we get
to one of their other ships...

1390
01:54:44,526 --> 01:54:47,612
...finding a path to Earth
should be relatively straightforward.

1391
01:54:48,363 --> 01:54:51,325
I don't want to go back
to where we came from.

1392
01:54:53,160 --> 01:54:55,829
I want to go where they came from.

1393
01:54:57,206 --> 01:54:59,625
Do you think you can do that, David?

1394
01:55:03,503 --> 01:55:04,712
Yes.

1395
01:55:05,338 --> 01:55:07,215
I believe I can.

1396
01:55:16,558 --> 01:55:19,186
May I ask what you hope to achieve
by going there?

1397
01:55:19,853 --> 01:55:21,938
They created us.

1398
01:55:22,147 --> 01:55:23,691
Then they tried to kill us.

1399
01:55:24,233 --> 01:55:26,151
They changed their minds.

1400
01:55:27,736 --> 01:55:29,362
I deserve to know why.

1401
01:55:31,614 --> 01:55:33,199
The answer is irrelevant.

1402
01:55:34,242 --> 01:55:36,536
Does it matter why
they changed their minds?

1403
01:55:37,245 --> 01:55:38,413
Yes.

1404
01:55:39,748 --> 01:55:41,416
Yes, it does.

1405
01:55:42,417 --> 01:55:43,584
I don't understand.

1406
01:55:45,086 --> 01:55:46,212
Well...

1407
01:55:48,255 --> 01:55:51,300
...l guess that's because
I'm a human being...

1408
01:55:51,467 --> 01:55:52,969
...and you're a robot.

1409
01:56:02,769 --> 01:56:03,729
I'm sorry.

1410
01:56:03,896 --> 01:56:05,064
It's quite all right.

1411
01:56:20,288 --> 01:56:23,082
Final report of the vessel Prometheus.

1412
01:56:23,249 --> 01:56:24,208
The ship and her...

1413
01:56:24,375 --> 01:56:26,501
...entire crew are gone.

1414
01:56:26,710 --> 01:56:28,587
If you're receiving this transmission...

1415
01:56:28,753 --> 01:56:32,132
...make no attempt
to come to its point of origin.

1416
01:56:32,299 --> 01:56:36,512
There is only death here now,
and I'm leaving it behind.

1417
01:56:37,597 --> 01:56:39,390
lt is New Year's Day...

1418
01:56:39,557 --> 01:56:42,601
...the year of our Lord, 2094.

1419
01:56:43,520 --> 01:56:46,022
My name is Elizabeth Shaw...

1420
01:56:46,230 --> 01:56:49,150
...the last survivor of the Prometheus.

1421
01:56:49,650 --> 01:56:52,152
And I am still searching.

1
00:01:10,707 --> 00:01:14,837
Happy birthday, dear Janice.

2
00:01:14,911 --> 00:01:18,506
Happy birthday to you!

3
00:01:20,635 --> 00:01:23,638
It's my anorexic boss' birthday.

4
00:01:24,924 --> 00:01:27,339
This means there's a certain amount
of inter-office pressure ...

5
00:01:27,432 --> 00:01:29,507
to stand around the conference table ...

6
00:01:29,593 --> 00:01:32,971
eating crappy food
and pretending to worship her.

7
00:01:34,729 --> 00:01:36,002
That's so good.

8
00:01:36,105 --> 00:01:40,434
Acting for five minutes like Janice
doesn't make all our lives miserable,

9
00:01:40,525 --> 00:01:43,231
is the hardest work I'll do all day.

10
00:01:49,535 --> 00:01:51,861
My job title is account manager.

11
00:01:52,496 --> 00:01:56,030
I used to be called
an account service representative,

12
00:01:56,124 --> 00:01:59,540
but a consultant told us we needed
to manage our clients ...

13
00:01:59,628 --> 00:02:01,502
and not service them.

14
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:10,545
I have a girlfriend whom
I neither manage nor service.

15
00:02:10,638 --> 00:02:14,257
That's my best friend, Barry,
fucking her on an IKEA kitchen table.

16
00:02:14,351 --> 00:02:16,973
I picked up for a really good price.

17
00:02:18,897 --> 00:02:22,432
I'm finding it hard to care about
anything these days.

18
00:02:22,526 --> 00:02:27,768
In fact, the only thing I do care about
is the fact that I can't care about anything.

19
00:02:27,864 --> 00:02:29,571
Seriously. It worries me.

20
00:02:31,283 --> 00:02:33,609
My name is Wesley Gibson.

21
00:02:37,873 --> 00:02:41,241
My dad walked out on my mom
when I was seven days old.

22
00:02:41,334 --> 00:02:46,080
Sometimes I wonder if he ever looked
into my baby blues eyes and asked himself,

23
00:02:47,092 --> 00:02:51,919
"Did I just father the most insignificant
asshole of the 21st century?"

24
00:03:07,444 --> 00:03:11,772
Well, if you could get me the consignment
to me by the 28th ... Yeah.

25
00:03:12,491 --> 00:03:15,326
Do you have the numbers in front of you?

26
00:03:26,379 --> 00:03:27,577
Relax.

27
00:03:27,672 --> 00:03:30,791
If your name had come up,
you'd be dead already.

28
00:03:33,469 --> 00:03:36,469
We've had some unexpected losses recently.

29
00:03:38,099 --> 00:03:39,972
We'd like to know ...

30
00:03:40,058 --> 00:03:42,977
where our competitor
is getting his munition.

31
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:54,489
It's clean.

32
00:03:54,907 --> 00:03:56,151
Meaning?

33
00:03:56,658 --> 00:03:58,698
Meaning it's untraceable.

34
00:03:59,328 --> 00:04:00,407
Your competitor's very smart.

35
00:04:01,621 --> 00:04:02,950
Get down!

36
00:04:20,557 --> 00:04:21,837
Fuck it.

37
00:05:48,433 --> 00:05:51,007
No one leaves the Fraternity, Cross.

38
00:05:51,437 --> 00:05:54,557
I have a new perspective on the Fraternity.

39
00:05:54,648 --> 00:05:56,107
Careful.

40
00:05:56,191 --> 00:06:00,106
You don't destroy something that's been
around for a thousand years.

41
00:06:00,195 --> 00:06:03,148
It's already destroyed.
He broke the code.

42
00:06:03,406 --> 00:06:05,399
I have to stop this.

43
00:06:05,492 --> 00:06:07,448
- Really?
- You know this.

44
00:06:08,577 --> 00:06:11,069
So why don't you face me yourself?

45
00:06:13,916 --> 00:06:16,289
Never send sheep to kill a wolf.

46
00:06:17,921 --> 00:06:19,961
They were just the decoys.

47
00:06:20,632 --> 00:06:22,292
Goodbye, Mr X.

48
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:58,413
Never send sheep to kill a wolf.

49
00:06:58,501 --> 00:07:00,660
They were just the decoys.

50
00:07:02,047 --> 00:07:03,327
Wesley!

51
00:07:04,465 --> 00:07:05,545
What is it?

52
00:07:05,634 --> 00:07:07,507
What do you mean, "What is it"? Listen.

53
00:07:10,013 --> 00:07:13,879
Well, how am I suppose to sleep
with all that fucking racket?

54
00:07:14,516 --> 00:07:18,385
When are we gonna move so we don't
have to wake up to that shit?

55
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:20,188
I kind of like it.

56
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:25,147
It helps to drown out the sound
of your annoying, fucking voice.

57
00:07:25,236 --> 00:07:27,359
Now, please, let me sleep.

58
00:07:27,446 --> 00:07:29,853
Have you even thought about our talk?

59
00:07:29,948 --> 00:07:31,028
Yes.

60
00:07:32,284 --> 00:07:33,778
Which one?

61
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:37,327
Perfect. That's perfect.

62
00:07:38,081 --> 00:07:39,741
Feed Annabelle.

63
00:08:25,044 --> 00:08:26,243
Sorry.

64
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:31,583
Oh, my fucking God.

65
00:08:32,176 --> 00:08:35,461
I hope that's not my billing report
sitting on your desk.

66
00:08:35,554 --> 00:08:38,009
Holy shit on an altar, it is.

67
00:08:38,849 --> 00:08:41,803
I want that report on my desk in one hour.

68
00:08:41,894 --> 00:08:45,427
Okay, everybody,
we're all gonna stay an extra hour ...

69
00:08:45,521 --> 00:08:47,515
Want to hear something sad?

70
00:08:47,608 --> 00:08:52,270
I need an ergonomic keyboard
to keep my repetitive stress injury in check.

71
00:08:52,363 --> 00:08:56,906
Just the fact that I repeat something enough
that it causes me stress is fucking sad.

72
00:08:56,992 --> 00:08:59,280
Nice job, dude. You seen Barry?

73
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:03,158
He had to go to the dentist. Again.

74
00:09:05,082 --> 00:09:06,114
Yes!

75
00:09:07,502 --> 00:09:08,616
Barry!

76
00:09:12,632 --> 00:09:15,122
You think they have that
morning-after pill here?

77
00:09:15,217 --> 00:09:16,796
That thing works.
Crush it up, put it in her omelette,

78
00:09:16,887 --> 00:09:20,753
"Hey, baby, breakfast in bed."
You can never be too safe.

79
00:09:20,848 --> 00:09:22,307
Oh, God.

80
00:09:23,351 --> 00:09:25,592
I lost my wallet somewhere.

81
00:09:27,688 --> 00:09:29,431
All this together?

82
00:09:30,441 --> 00:09:32,184
- No, no.
- Yes.

83
00:09:34,236 --> 00:09:35,730
He is the man.

84
00:09:35,821 --> 00:09:38,146
- How much is it?
- Oh. Plus this.

85
00:09:39,282 --> 00:09:40,527
$20.42.

86
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:43,071
Watermelon.

87
00:09:44,496 --> 00:09:46,037
Chicks dig it.

88
00:09:49,043 --> 00:09:50,074
Thanks.

89
00:09:50,544 --> 00:09:51,624
See you next time.

90
00:09:51,712 --> 00:09:52,791
Have a good night.

91
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,422
I love these energy drinks, man.

92
00:09:54,506 --> 00:09:57,460
I'm almost, like, kind of on
an energy drink cleanse,

93
00:09:57,551 --> 00:10:00,670
where I do one for breakfast
and then, like, two or three for lunch.

94
00:10:00,762 --> 00:10:02,043
I'm the man?

95
00:10:02,139 --> 00:10:04,380
 Yeah, right, Barry, I'm the man.

96
00:10:04,474 --> 00:10:05,884
In fact, I'm so much the man,

97
00:10:05,975 --> 00:10:10,683
I have a standing prescription for
medication to control my anxiety attacks.

98
00:10:11,188 --> 00:10:13,858
God, I wish I had something else
to relieve my stress.

99
00:10:13,941 --> 00:10:15,518
Hello, Wesley.

100
00:10:18,196 --> 00:10:21,315
You know, there are people,
beautiful people,

101
00:10:21,407 --> 00:10:25,155
you just wish they could see you
in a different setting, a different place,

102
00:10:25,244 --> 00:10:27,700
instead of where you are,
what you've become.

103
00:10:27,789 --> 00:10:29,496
Nicole is so hot.

104
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:32,239
What?

105
00:10:33,127 --> 00:10:35,202
Boom goes the dynamite.

106
00:10:35,295 --> 00:10:38,166
But most of all,
you wish you weren't such a pussy ...

107
00:10:38,257 --> 00:10:41,376
for wishing for things
that will never change.

108
00:10:44,054 --> 00:10:47,054
Good God A'mighty, you're over
here like it's spring fucking break,

109
00:10:47,139 --> 00:10:49,429
and I still don't have that billing report.

110
00:10:49,518 --> 00:10:52,091
Why do I even keep you around, Wesley?

111
00:10:52,813 --> 00:10:54,521
I'll get it done, Janice.

112
00:10:54,606 --> 00:10:58,106
Like I never heard that before.
"I'll get it done."

113
00:10:59,319 --> 00:11:01,441
"I'll get it done. I'll get it done, Janice.

114
00:11:01,529 --> 00:11:03,273
"I'll get it done."

115
00:11:14,625 --> 00:11:17,912
Why don't you have anything
to say for yourself?

116
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:20,917
I'm sorry.

117
00:11:21,632 --> 00:11:23,092
Well, you're worthless.

118
00:11:23,176 --> 00:11:26,176
I'm the one who's sorry I hired your ass.

119
00:11:51,661 --> 00:11:55,113
You know what the best thing is
about the end of the day?

120
00:11:55,207 --> 00:11:58,161
Tomorrow it starts all over again.

121
00:13:10,029 --> 00:13:12,021
- Hi. How you doing?
- Good.

122
00:13:25,044 --> 00:13:27,617
- I'm sorry?
- You apologise too much.

123
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:33,341
Sorry about that.

124
00:13:41,685 --> 00:13:43,558
I knew your father.

125
00:13:47,148 --> 00:13:50,020
My father left the week I was born, so ...

126
00:13:51,069 --> 00:13:55,316
Your father died yesterday on the rooftop
of the Metropolitan Building.

127
00:13:55,407 --> 00:13:56,735
Sorry.

128
00:14:03,039 --> 00:14:04,747
Look, the liquor rounds
are just over there, so ...

129
00:14:04,833 --> 00:14:07,453
Your father was one of the greatest
assassins who ever lived.

130
00:14:07,543 --> 00:14:10,165
The man who killed him is behind you.

131
00:15:28,330 --> 00:15:30,322
This guy's just shooting up ...

132
00:15:38,215 --> 00:15:39,708
Sorry. Sorry.

133
00:16:05,616 --> 00:16:09,566
What ... Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
What the fuck just happened?

134
00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:15,578
Please! Please! Please drive faster.

135
00:16:15,667 --> 00:16:17,541
- Please be quiet.
- Please drive ... Please drive faster.

136
00:16:17,628 --> 00:16:21,080
Please ... Please understand
that I care about my life!

137
00:16:26,262 --> 00:16:28,468
I don't know what the fuck
you did to piss this guy off,

138
00:16:28,555 --> 00:16:30,594
but you're gonna have to let me out
and call the cops!

139
00:16:33,477 --> 00:16:34,757
Hey! Hey!

140
00:16:38,523 --> 00:16:42,272
What are you doing? Oh, shit!
Are you crazy?

141
00:16:46,238 --> 00:16:47,567
Oh, shit!

142
00:16:52,913 --> 00:16:54,952
I think we lost him. I think we lost him.

143
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:58,206
Could you let me out
at the next corner, please?

144
00:16:59,627 --> 00:17:00,907
Shit!

145
00:17:03,881 --> 00:17:04,912
Fuck!

146
00:17:07,385 --> 00:17:09,092
Oh, shit!

147
00:17:11,304 --> 00:17:12,965
He's right there!

148
00:17:24,318 --> 00:17:27,485
Look, I'm an accountant.
I'm just an accountant.

149
00:17:28,822 --> 00:17:30,565
Oh, fuck!

150
00:17:33,327 --> 00:17:35,782
He's fucking persistent, you know.

151
00:17:37,206 --> 00:17:38,368
Fuck!

152
00:17:45,838 --> 00:17:47,665
You kick his ass!

153
00:17:52,513 --> 00:17:53,841
Shoot him!

154
00:17:55,056 --> 00:17:59,006
What are you doing?
What are you shooting our car for, huh?

155
00:18:00,728 --> 00:18:03,515
- Are you crazy?
- Grab the wheel.

156
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:06,016
Where are you going?

157
00:18:07,694 --> 00:18:09,353
Get back in here!

158
00:18:10,821 --> 00:18:13,490
Oh, my God!

159
00:18:29,173 --> 00:18:31,212
Oh, damn! I'm sorry.

160
00:18:40,808 --> 00:18:42,267
- Gun!
- What?

161
00:18:44,979 --> 00:18:46,603
Under the seat!

162
00:18:46,689 --> 00:18:47,804
Here.

163
00:19:14,425 --> 00:19:15,753
Oh, shit!

164
00:19:18,429 --> 00:19:20,255
Shit!

165
00:19:26,436 --> 00:19:27,467
- Look out!
- Get out!

166
00:19:27,562 --> 00:19:29,805
Look out! Oh, my God!

167
00:19:29,898 --> 00:19:31,143
Shit!

168
00:19:39,074 --> 00:19:43,985
I'm sorry!

169
00:20:02,638 --> 00:20:04,181
Behind you!

170
00:21:32,058 --> 00:21:33,303
Fuck.

171
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:38,271
Shit. Shit.

172
00:21:40,358 --> 00:21:41,556
Hello.

173
00:21:42,527 --> 00:21:44,852
I don't have any money or ...

174
00:21:46,072 --> 00:21:47,898
I thought he'd be ...

175
00:21:48,198 --> 00:21:49,609
taller.

176
00:21:50,785 --> 00:21:52,065
Taller?

177
00:21:53,412 --> 00:21:54,656
Sir ...

178
00:21:55,582 --> 00:22:00,078
Sir, I've been trying to explain
to the lady here that I'm an accountant.

179
00:22:00,170 --> 00:22:03,869
I'm an account service representative ...
I'm an account manager.

180
00:22:03,964 --> 00:22:06,918
And I'm sure that if you call
my boss, Janice,

181
00:22:07,009 --> 00:22:09,879
she'd fill you in on whatever
has gone wrong.

182
00:22:09,971 --> 00:22:13,220
You can contact her by email or ...
She'll put you straight.

183
00:22:13,306 --> 00:22:15,549
Shoot the wings off the flies.

184
00:22:16,518 --> 00:22:18,759
I don't know what that means.

185
00:22:19,479 --> 00:22:22,729
Shoot the wings off the flies.

186
00:22:27,446 --> 00:22:30,981
I really think you have me mixed up
with somebody else.

187
00:22:32,492 --> 00:22:33,903
On three.

188
00:22:34,410 --> 00:22:36,699
Either you shoot, or I do.

189
00:22:48,048 --> 00:22:49,211
One.

190
00:22:52,344 --> 00:22:53,507
Okay.

191
00:23:00,102 --> 00:23:01,217
Two.

192
00:23:01,312 --> 00:23:03,351
I can't even see them!

193
00:23:08,902 --> 00:23:10,147
Three.

194
00:23:27,629 --> 00:23:29,207
Okay. Okay.

195
00:23:50,317 --> 00:23:51,349
That's impossible.

196
00:23:51,444 --> 00:23:54,894
A lot of things for you
weren't possible before today.

197
00:23:55,655 --> 00:23:58,906
What you experienced, Wesley,
was not a panic attack.

198
00:23:59,577 --> 00:24:03,361
Your heart was beating in excess of
400 beats per minute,

199
00:24:03,456 --> 00:24:06,160
sending abundant amounts of
adrenaline into your bloodstream.

200
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:09,416
This allows you to see and react faster
than normal.

201
00:24:09,503 --> 00:24:12,420
Only a few people in the world can do that.

202
00:24:12,798 --> 00:24:15,833
Your father could do it and you can do it.

203
00:24:16,802 --> 00:24:20,336
With a little work,
you can learn to control these attacks.

204
00:24:20,430 --> 00:24:22,221
Stay away from me.

205
00:24:22,974 --> 00:24:24,384
Just stay back from me.

206
00:24:24,475 --> 00:24:26,765
I have a gun, sir. All right?

207
00:24:28,730 --> 00:24:30,390
My name is Sloan.

208
00:24:31,274 --> 00:24:32,733
This is Fox.

209
00:24:33,151 --> 00:24:36,484
And the others you see around you
are all very good at killing.

210
00:24:36,570 --> 00:24:38,896
So, if I were you,
I'd keep the gun pointed at me.

211
00:24:38,990 --> 00:24:41,029
You don't wanna point it at any of them.

212
00:24:41,116 --> 00:24:42,695
That's better.

213
00:24:42,785 --> 00:24:44,196
- You're insane.
- No.

214
00:24:44,286 --> 00:24:46,362
Insanity is wasting your life as a nothing ...

215
00:24:46,455 --> 00:24:48,827
when you have the blood of a killer
flowing in your veins.

216
00:24:48,916 --> 00:24:52,415
Insanity is being shit on, beat down,

217
00:24:52,878 --> 00:24:54,954
coasting through life
in a miserable existence ...

218
00:24:55,046 --> 00:24:59,128
when you have a caged lion locked inside
and a key to release it.

219
00:25:00,302 --> 00:25:04,680
This gun you're holding is an Imanishi 17.
It belonged to your father.

220
00:25:05,807 --> 00:25:08,678
He could conduct
a symphony orchestra with it.

221
00:25:08,769 --> 00:25:12,767
And you're going to use it to kill the man
who shot him down in cold blood.

222
00:25:12,856 --> 00:25:16,604
- I can't ...
- The same man who tried to kill you tonight.

223
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:21,567
Your father was one of us.

224
00:25:21,656 --> 00:25:25,440
A fraternity of assassins.
The weapons of fate.

225
00:25:26,869 --> 00:25:29,954
We've transferred all of his assets
over to you.

226
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:33,456
And let me assure you, they are substantial.

227
00:25:35,712 --> 00:25:39,128
It is your long-awaited destiny ...

228
00:25:39,215 --> 00:25:40,674
to join us.

229
00:25:53,103 --> 00:25:55,428
Back off. Back off.

230
00:25:57,190 --> 00:25:59,647
You don't know anything about me.

231
00:25:59,986 --> 00:26:02,821
Stay away from me. Stay away from me.

232
00:26:02,905 --> 00:26:05,028
You stay away from me?

233
00:26:05,115 --> 00:26:08,366
You stay away from me, please?
Will you let me through?

234
00:26:39,857 --> 00:26:43,309
You know when you have a dream
and you're half awake,

235
00:26:43,403 --> 00:26:45,442
but it's still in the fringe of your brain?

236
00:26:45,529 --> 00:26:49,313
Then you open your eyes
and you're so damn glad it was a dream.

237
00:26:56,998 --> 00:26:59,123
This was nothing like that.

238
00:27:25,610 --> 00:27:28,647
I'm sorry. Could you just give me
one second? Thank you.

239
00:27:38,330 --> 00:27:39,611
Oh, shit.

240
00:27:50,050 --> 00:27:51,295
Wesley.

241
00:27:55,430 --> 00:27:57,257
What's up with you?

242
00:27:57,807 --> 00:27:59,552
What do you mean?

243
00:28:00,269 --> 00:28:02,938
You're ... You're here early.

244
00:28:05,941 --> 00:28:07,684
Is ... You seem a little pepped up.

245
00:28:07,776 --> 00:28:10,267
- You all right?
- Well, yeah.

246
00:28:11,196 --> 00:28:12,358
Yeah.

247
00:28:13,239 --> 00:28:14,983
I guess I feel ...

248
00:28:15,992 --> 00:28:17,949
kind of different.

249
00:28:18,452 --> 00:28:21,122
Whatever. I'm gonna go get
some Post-it Notes. Do you want one?

250
00:28:21,205 --> 00:28:22,284
- No.
- Really?

251
00:28:22,373 --> 00:28:24,116
- Yeah.
- Okay.

252
00:28:38,222 --> 00:28:41,971
Jesus H. fucking Popsicle,
I still don't have my billing reports,

253
00:28:42,059 --> 00:28:44,977
but you've got time to sit here
and Google your ass off.

254
00:28:45,062 --> 00:28:46,604
Well, I know one thing.

255
00:28:46,689 --> 00:28:49,144
You've got your review
coming up next week,

256
00:28:49,232 --> 00:28:53,561
and I can't wait to start checking me off
some big fucking boxes.

257
00:28:53,653 --> 00:28:56,654
Attitude, poor! Performance, poor!

258
00:28:57,949 --> 00:28:59,990
Management skills, poor!

259
00:29:00,078 --> 00:29:03,362
Works well with others.
That's a fucking joke.

260
00:29:04,581 --> 00:29:07,119
What is this bullshit? Who's this prick?

261
00:29:07,209 --> 00:29:10,163
Some loser gets his head blown off
at the Metropolitan ...

262
00:29:10,254 --> 00:29:12,460
Shut the fuck up!

263
00:29:20,430 --> 00:29:23,928
She has one single iota of tenuous power.

264
00:29:24,016 --> 00:29:26,851
She thinks she can push everyone around.

265
00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:30,098
You don't need this.

266
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:35,855
I understand.

267
00:29:37,738 --> 00:29:40,693
Junior high must have been kind of tough,

268
00:29:40,783 --> 00:29:44,401
but it doesn't give you the right to treat
your workers like horseshit, Janice.

269
00:29:44,494 --> 00:29:46,867
I know we laugh at you, Janice.

270
00:29:47,373 --> 00:29:50,872
We all know you keep your stash of jelly
doughnuts in the top drawer of your desk.

271
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:53,035
But I want you to know ...

272
00:29:53,545 --> 00:29:57,673
if you weren't such a bitch,
we'd feel sorry for you.

273
00:30:00,051 --> 00:30:02,045
I do feel sorry for you.

274
00:30:03,013 --> 00:30:05,884
But as it stands, the way you behave,

275
00:30:06,725 --> 00:30:09,678
I feel I can speak for the entire office ...

276
00:30:10,228 --> 00:30:12,138
when I tell you ...

277
00:30:13,189 --> 00:30:14,980
go fuck yourself.

278
00:30:29,663 --> 00:30:32,499
Yeah. That was great, bro. Who's the man?

279
00:30:39,965 --> 00:30:41,081
I'm the man.

280
00:31:19,128 --> 00:31:21,120
That's a bad idea.

281
00:31:23,341 --> 00:31:24,965
Couldn't find your keys, huh?

282
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:26,794
That could be handy.
You going to teach me that?

283
00:31:26,886 --> 00:31:28,593
I might need that.

284
00:31:29,555 --> 00:31:32,841
So, Fox, right? What is that?
Is that a call sign?

285
00:31:32,934 --> 00:31:35,638
Is it like Maverick in Top Gun?

286
00:31:36,186 --> 00:31:38,760
You could tell me,
but you'd have to kill me?

287
00:31:38,856 --> 00:31:40,647
I'm just kidding.

288
00:32:51,468 --> 00:32:52,713
Peter!

289
00:32:54,554 --> 00:32:58,848
Check the shuttle rotation on this STB.
It should be 300 per minute.

290
00:32:59,142 --> 00:33:02,477
This kind of cotton weave,
the opposing thread count should be 4,000.

291
00:33:02,563 --> 00:33:05,978
Hey, this is pretty awesome, huh?

292
00:33:07,401 --> 00:33:08,943
Is it a front?

293
00:33:10,904 --> 00:33:13,525
- Front for what?
- I don't know.

294
00:33:13,615 --> 00:33:15,157
Assassinations.

295
00:33:16,367 --> 00:33:19,404
You may think this is a front for something,

296
00:33:20,246 --> 00:33:23,247
all I can tell you is this is a textile mill.

297
00:33:23,332 --> 00:33:26,249
And George ...
George, go help Peter up there.

298
00:33:26,335 --> 00:33:27,449
Yeah.

299
00:33:28,921 --> 00:33:30,794
This is a textile mill.

300
00:33:31,256 --> 00:33:32,370
And a damn good one.

301
00:33:32,465 --> 00:33:35,254
Yeah, that's cute,
but that's bullshit, right?

302
00:33:35,344 --> 00:33:38,595
I mean, all these guys are killers,
aren't they?

303
00:33:40,933 --> 00:33:43,056
I think you owe me some answers.

304
00:33:43,561 --> 00:33:46,229
All right. Clearly I don't understand,

305
00:33:46,313 --> 00:33:49,148
but do you make sweaters
or do you kill people?

306
00:34:09,711 --> 00:34:12,795
That's an awful lot of questions over coffee.

307
00:34:21,805 --> 00:34:24,012
Are you sure you're ready for the answers?

308
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:25,759
Yes, I'm sure.

309
00:34:26,685 --> 00:34:28,512
I can't go back.

310
00:34:28,604 --> 00:34:30,264
Not to my life.

311
00:34:34,819 --> 00:34:36,396
He's all yours.

312
00:34:37,321 --> 00:34:39,148
All right. We're up.

313
00:34:49,958 --> 00:34:51,536
How you doing?

314
00:34:52,669 --> 00:34:54,247
I'm The Repairman.

315
00:34:54,338 --> 00:34:56,080
What do you repair?

316
00:34:56,464 --> 00:35:00,509
A lifetime of bad habits.

317
00:35:00,718 --> 00:35:03,006
- Okay.
- Would you do me a favour?

318
00:35:03,095 --> 00:35:05,670
Just put your arms behind your back.

319
00:35:05,766 --> 00:35:08,173
- It's okay.
- I don't know ...

320
00:35:08,268 --> 00:35:09,928
- Just behind your back.
- Is this okay?

321
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:11,348
Just relax.

322
00:35:11,438 --> 00:35:13,180
Is this part of it?

323
00:35:14,357 --> 00:35:15,816
There we go.

324
00:35:16,192 --> 00:35:20,569
- You going to put a bag over my head?
- No. There's no need for a bag.

325
00:35:20,655 --> 00:35:23,857
- That's not too tight, is it?
- No, that's nice.

326
00:35:32,999 --> 00:35:34,661
Why did you come here, Wesley?

327
00:35:34,752 --> 00:35:37,539
Well, you brought me here, remember?

328
00:35:37,630 --> 00:35:39,919
What the fuck did you do that ...

329
00:35:55,814 --> 00:35:57,473
How many punches
did The Repairman throw ...

330
00:35:57,565 --> 00:35:59,891
before he was counting sheep?

331
00:36:01,402 --> 00:36:05,567
Well, I haven't spent a lot of time
having my face smashed in before, all right?

332
00:36:05,657 --> 00:36:10,200
- Did you spend a lot of time with knives?
- At breakfast, lunch and dinner.

333
00:36:11,538 --> 00:36:12,735
Fuck.

334
00:36:16,626 --> 00:36:19,033
It was a rhetorical question, culo.

335
00:36:19,128 --> 00:36:22,413
You interrupt me again,
I use the business end.

336
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:25,298
Here's what you need to know, puto.

337
00:36:25,384 --> 00:36:27,590
Knives are easy to hide.

338
00:36:29,346 --> 00:36:32,263
They don't jam and they never
run out of bullets.

339
00:36:33,766 --> 00:36:35,926
They come in handy ...

340
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:38,641
when you have to do some
close contact work.

341
00:36:38,730 --> 00:36:40,522
What the fuck, man?

342
00:36:48,281 --> 00:36:50,488
- Come here. Come here.
- What?

343
00:36:52,118 --> 00:36:54,276
Now, try to cut me.
- What?

344
00:36:55,956 --> 00:36:57,912
Try to cut me. Hey!

345
00:36:58,374 --> 00:37:02,372
- Just stick me with that ...
- Be careful with that. That's sharp.

346
00:37:02,461 --> 00:37:05,464
- Just stick and stick and stick.
- Why?

347
00:37:05,549 --> 00:37:08,122
- Seriously, man, I could hurt you.
- Hey!

348
00:37:08,218 --> 00:37:10,127
Okay, pussy.

349
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:12,046
- I'm not a pussy.
- You're a pussy.

350
00:37:12,138 --> 00:37:13,762
- No, I'm not a pussy.
- You're a pussy!

351
00:37:13,848 --> 00:37:16,849
I'm not a pussy. I got a healthy respect
for the human condition.

352
00:37:16,934 --> 00:37:18,642
- Fuck that, you pussy!
- I'm not a pussy!

353
00:37:18,727 --> 00:37:19,890
- You're a pussy!
- I'm not a pussy!

354
00:37:19,978 --> 00:37:22,434
- Come on, pussy.
- I'm not a pussy!

355
00:37:44,669 --> 00:37:46,497
Hi. How you doing?

356
00:37:46,588 --> 00:37:48,746
What the fuck?

357
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:50,455
The fuck!

358
00:37:50,550 --> 00:37:52,839
Just a moment. Just a moment.

359
00:37:54,345 --> 00:37:55,507
Sorry.

360
00:37:55,596 --> 00:37:57,470
Hello? Hey!

361
00:37:57,557 --> 00:37:59,632
Hey, come back! Hey!

362
00:38:00,267 --> 00:38:02,426
You must drink. Drink. Yeah.

363
00:38:09,610 --> 00:38:12,528
- What is this?
- This is the recovery room.

364
00:38:13,114 --> 00:38:17,657
This bath stimulates white blood cells
and speed up the process.

365
00:38:17,743 --> 00:38:21,243
In here, bruises, cuts, breaks
heal in hours, not days.

366
00:38:21,622 --> 00:38:23,365
You shitting me?

367
00:38:25,459 --> 00:38:27,167
- What is that? Vodka?
- Yeah.

368
00:38:27,253 --> 00:38:29,161
- Are you Russian?
- Yeah.

369
00:38:30,296 --> 00:38:31,542
Get up.

370
00:38:33,383 --> 00:38:34,793
This is The Gunsmith.

371
00:38:34,884 --> 00:38:39,879
He knows more about a piece than anybody,
and he's gonna teach you how to use one.

372
00:38:39,973 --> 00:38:42,262
- How you doing?
- Pretty good.

373
00:38:43,602 --> 00:38:47,267
- You know that Seltzer broke his leg?
- Oh, really?

374
00:38:47,356 --> 00:38:49,264
Yeah, in three places.

375
00:38:50,441 --> 00:38:53,229
How'd he do that?
- Jumped off a building.

376
00:38:54,112 --> 00:38:57,611
So, is he okay?
- Yeah. It's pretty bad, though.

377
00:38:57,699 --> 00:38:59,276
Oh, my God.

378
00:38:59,950 --> 00:39:02,952
Oh, my God, you guys, that is so realistic.

379
00:39:04,622 --> 00:39:07,031
He's been in recovery for, like,
three days now,

380
00:39:07,125 --> 00:39:10,244
and they say they're not even
gonna let him out.

381
00:39:19,762 --> 00:39:21,421
Oh, my God.

382
00:39:22,765 --> 00:39:24,175
Oh, my God.

383
00:39:24,683 --> 00:39:25,928
Oh, my God!

384
00:39:26,017 --> 00:39:29,433
Hey, we can't shoot a dead woman!
She might be somebody's mom ...

385
00:39:31,564 --> 00:39:35,265
You need to know what it's like
to put a bullet in a body.

386
00:39:35,777 --> 00:39:37,522
Why are you here?

387
00:39:38,239 --> 00:39:42,568
You know, I thought I was learning to be
some kind of super assassin.

388
00:39:43,994 --> 00:39:45,192
You know, if I wanted to get beat up,

389
00:39:45,287 --> 00:39:48,288
I would have stayed in my cubicle,
you know.

390
00:39:55,588 --> 00:39:56,750
Fuck.

391
00:40:07,934 --> 00:40:10,092
All right, shoot the target.

392
00:40:10,812 --> 00:40:12,354
From there.

393
00:40:13,565 --> 00:40:17,776
- You want me shoot through Wilbur?
- I want you to curve the bullet.

394
00:40:18,653 --> 00:40:20,977
How am I suppose to do that?

395
00:40:21,071 --> 00:40:23,278
It's not a question of how,

396
00:40:23,657 --> 00:40:25,696
it's a question of what.

397
00:40:25,784 --> 00:40:28,951
If no one told you 
that bullets flew straight ...

398
00:40:29,037 --> 00:40:31,243
and I gave you a gun
and told you to hit the target,

399
00:40:31,331 --> 00:40:33,075
what would you do?

400
00:40:34,125 --> 00:40:36,450
Let your instincts guide you.

401
00:40:50,642 --> 00:40:52,848
How the hell did he do that?

402
00:40:52,936 --> 00:40:55,722
Can you do that? Can you do that? Hello?

403
00:41:00,026 --> 00:41:01,852
Hey, I think that's my old train.

404
00:41:01,944 --> 00:41:03,320
Still is.

405
00:41:12,455 --> 00:41:15,207
Shit! You fucking asshole!

406
00:41:15,291 --> 00:41:16,666
Come on!

407
00:41:21,088 --> 00:41:22,416
Let's go.

408
00:41:22,506 --> 00:41:24,914
Are you out of your fucking mind?

409
00:41:35,852 --> 00:41:39,471
Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

410
00:41:58,290 --> 00:42:02,122
Oh, God, I feel ... I feel ... I feel ...

411
00:42:02,586 --> 00:42:04,413
I feel kind of good.

412
00:42:12,304 --> 00:42:16,551
He got Rictus.
Perfect shot. Impossible angle.

413
00:42:17,601 --> 00:42:20,175
Cross is taking us out one by one.

414
00:42:25,317 --> 00:42:28,353
And Wesley is the only one
who can get to him.

415
00:42:30,072 --> 00:42:32,527
Cross gets closer with each hour.

416
00:42:35,035 --> 00:42:36,694
Get back to work.

417
00:42:40,082 --> 00:42:41,362
See that?

418
00:42:41,875 --> 00:42:43,748
- It's a shuttle.
- Okay.

419
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:47,327
I want you to try and catch it.

420
00:42:48,339 --> 00:42:50,048
You want me to stick my hand in there?

421
00:42:50,133 --> 00:42:52,256
Yes. I want you to catch it.

422
00:43:02,102 --> 00:43:03,430
You wanna put a gun to my head?

423
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:05,394
I can just slow things down
like with the flies.

424
00:43:05,481 --> 00:43:08,516
You need to learn
to control that by yourself.

425
00:43:23,331 --> 00:43:24,992
Fuck, fuck, fuck!

426
00:43:25,584 --> 00:43:27,790
This is bullshit! Fuck this!

427
00:43:38,304 --> 00:43:40,262
How's it going today, Wesley?

428
00:43:40,349 --> 00:43:43,349
No. Fuck the loom and fuck The Repairman!

429
00:43:43,435 --> 00:43:47,267
I can shoot the wings off the back of a fly!
I'm ready!

430
00:43:47,355 --> 00:43:49,644
You're ready when Fox says you're ready.

431
00:43:49,733 --> 00:43:52,188
- Who put her in charge?
- I did.

432
00:43:57,198 --> 00:43:58,478
Wesley.

433
00:44:03,287 --> 00:44:06,204
People think you use cheese
to catch these beauties.

434
00:44:06,290 --> 00:44:08,994
But they go ape-shit for peanut butter.

435
00:44:09,751 --> 00:44:13,702
Your father was a big fan of this. Watch.

436
00:44:17,259 --> 00:44:19,928
Plastic explosive and peanut butter!

437
00:44:20,721 --> 00:44:22,298
Sorry, Mickey.

438
00:44:24,057 --> 00:44:27,058
Five, four, three, two, one.

439
00:44:35,152 --> 00:44:37,060
Hey. Hey, Russian.

440
00:44:39,488 --> 00:44:41,198
Good for one. Yeah.

441
00:44:41,909 --> 00:44:44,399
Imagine if you had a thousand.

442
00:44:46,371 --> 00:44:49,206
They really fucked you up, didn't they?

443
00:44:49,874 --> 00:44:52,033
What the hell did they do to you?

444
00:44:53,294 --> 00:44:55,536
Throw you in front of a moving train
for no reason?

445
00:44:55,630 --> 00:44:57,706
Beat the shit out of you?

446
00:44:58,632 --> 00:45:03,875
You know, you can say it,
this place is bullshit. It's bullshit, huh?

447
00:45:03,971 --> 00:45:05,299
Bullshit!

448
00:45:14,231 --> 00:45:16,271
Repairman. Five minutes.

449
00:45:18,819 --> 00:45:21,145
Heads up out of the question?

450
00:45:26,952 --> 00:45:28,197
Fuck.

451
00:45:28,286 --> 00:45:30,693
You're a waste of my fucking time!
Why are you here?

452
00:45:30,789 --> 00:45:32,781
I don't know, so hit me.

453
00:45:42,092 --> 00:45:45,756
- Why are you here?
- I had a shit life, so why wouldn't I?

454
00:45:47,556 --> 00:45:49,844
I wanna kick your fucking ass!

455
00:45:50,850 --> 00:45:52,677
Tell me what you want me to say.

456
00:45:52,769 --> 00:45:55,259
- Why are you here?
- I don't know!

457
00:45:58,274 --> 00:45:59,981
Why are you here?

458
00:46:01,319 --> 00:46:03,690
- Why are you here?
- I don't know why I'm here.

459
00:46:03,779 --> 00:46:05,486
Why are you here?

460
00:46:08,533 --> 00:46:09,731
Why are you here?

461
00:46:09,826 --> 00:46:12,864
I don't know who I am.

462
00:46:17,835 --> 00:46:20,123
- What did you say?
- I said ...

463
00:46:21,129 --> 00:46:23,336
I said I don't know who I am.

464
00:46:37,812 --> 00:46:40,646
Do you really want to know who you are?

465
00:46:52,869 --> 00:46:54,778
Yeah. It's my room.

466
00:46:55,412 --> 00:46:56,575
No.

467
00:46:58,332 --> 00:47:00,490
This was your father's room.

468
00:47:13,639 --> 00:47:15,216
What happened?

469
00:47:16,099 --> 00:47:18,851
A member
of this fraternity went rogue.

470
00:47:19,311 --> 00:47:20,509
Cross.

471
00:47:23,190 --> 00:47:26,890
He started by killing
the one man who was better than him.

472
00:47:28,153 --> 00:47:29,611
Your father.

473
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:34,398
Blindsided him on a rooftop.

474
00:47:35,243 --> 00:47:36,736
Betrayed him.

475
00:47:39,872 --> 00:47:42,030
Everything in this room,

476
00:47:42,124 --> 00:47:45,708
books, weapons, clothes,

477
00:47:46,295 --> 00:47:48,039
belonged to him.

478
00:47:48,131 --> 00:47:50,123
Now they belong to you.

479
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:54,052
Find a connection in this room, Wesley.

480
00:47:55,388 --> 00:47:58,591
It may be the only way
of finding out who you are.

481
00:48:18,369 --> 00:48:22,282
Now I know why I could never care
about anything before this.

482
00:48:23,248 --> 00:48:25,039
I was living a lie.

483
00:48:26,626 --> 00:48:30,209
Finally, I have a chance to step
into my father's shoes.

484
00:48:30,296 --> 00:48:33,796
Grow a pair. Live the life I was born to live.

485
00:48:34,592 --> 00:48:38,804
I've been pissing it all away
like it was another fucking billing report.

486
00:48:38,888 --> 00:48:40,548
I have to train harder.

487
00:48:40,639 --> 00:48:43,214
I have to be as good as my father.

488
00:48:51,859 --> 00:48:55,857
On these shelves, Wesley,
are the records of the Fraternity kills,

489
00:48:55,946 --> 00:48:59,150
everything you will need to kill your target.

490
00:48:59,241 --> 00:49:01,779
To kill Cross,

491
00:49:01,868 --> 00:49:06,660
the man who betrayed the Fraternity
and murdered my father, I must prepare.

492
00:49:06,748 --> 00:49:11,077
I have to become his student,
memorise every move he ever made,

493
00:49:11,169 --> 00:49:13,578
every attack he ever executed.

494
00:49:21,096 --> 00:49:25,758
When he dropped a patient in an airtight
room surrounded by Secret Service agents.

495
00:49:25,851 --> 00:49:28,638
When he took out that
businessman in the elevator.

496
00:49:28,729 --> 00:49:30,851
His bullets untraceable, of course.

497
00:49:33,315 --> 00:49:37,942
Or how no matter what the weapon
or how he eliminated his target,

498
00:49:39,489 --> 00:49:42,193
he was always one chess move ahead.

499
00:49:43,619 --> 00:49:45,492
One move more prepared.

500
00:49:45,954 --> 00:49:47,661
One step quicker.

501
00:49:47,914 --> 00:49:49,705
One shot more precise.

502
00:49:50,333 --> 00:49:54,829
In fact, in all my research,
I found that he never missed a target.

503
00:49:55,713 --> 00:49:57,255
Not until me.

504
00:51:04,737 --> 00:51:05,900
Yeah!

505
00:51:53,701 --> 00:51:57,948
First time in your life, Wesley,
you're in control.

506
00:52:36,284 --> 00:52:37,944
Shoot the target.

507
00:52:49,839 --> 00:52:51,334
You're crazy.

508
00:53:40,263 --> 00:53:42,421
Welcome to the Fraternity.

509
00:53:54,360 --> 00:53:57,065
We call this the Loom of Fate.

510
00:54:09,208 --> 00:54:13,751
After today,
you will never set foot in here again.

511
00:54:13,837 --> 00:54:15,165
Why not?

512
00:54:15,588 --> 00:54:17,629
Because, like an apostle,

513
00:54:18,217 --> 00:54:22,381
your task is not to interpret, but to deliver.

514
00:54:24,973 --> 00:54:28,058
Every culture in history has a secret code,

515
00:54:28,393 --> 00:54:31,228
one you won't find in traditional texts.

516
00:54:32,523 --> 00:54:34,598
A thousand years ago,

517
00:54:34,691 --> 00:54:39,020
a clan of weavers discovered
a mystical language hidden in the fabric.

518
00:54:40,529 --> 00:54:43,899
They called themselves the Fraternity.

519
00:54:43,991 --> 00:54:46,612
I'll be honest with you, all I see are threads.

520
00:54:47,746 --> 00:54:49,121
Come here.

521
00:54:53,210 --> 00:54:54,620
Look there.

522
00:54:55,836 --> 00:54:57,830
Do you see that one thread
that missed the weave ...

523
00:54:57,922 --> 00:54:59,464
and lies on top of the others?

524
00:54:59,549 --> 00:55:02,585
- Like a mistake?
- No, it's a code.

525
00:55:03,511 --> 00:55:06,843
If the vertical thread is on top, it's a one.

526
00:55:07,973 --> 00:55:10,298
If it's below, it's a zero.

527
00:55:11,393 --> 00:55:12,935
Binary code?

528
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:14,931
What does it say?

529
00:55:15,688 --> 00:55:17,182
It's a name.

530
00:55:18,109 --> 00:55:19,519
A target.

531
00:55:21,778 --> 00:55:23,985
Where do the names come from?

532
00:55:24,823 --> 00:55:27,611
Come out of a necessity, Wesley.

533
00:55:27,701 --> 00:55:30,737
A necessity to maintain balance
in the world.

534
00:55:31,287 --> 00:55:33,992
They are orders that must be executed,

535
00:55:34,416 --> 00:55:39,872
entrusted to us so that we
might forge stability out of chaos.

536
00:55:42,423 --> 00:55:44,416
This one is yours.

537
00:55:48,555 --> 00:55:49,966
I don't ...

538
00:55:51,849 --> 00:55:54,554
Look, I thought you brought me here
to kill Cross.

539
00:55:54,644 --> 00:55:55,924
You will.

540
00:55:56,020 --> 00:55:57,395
In time.

541
00:55:58,982 --> 00:56:01,139
This is your first assignment.

542
00:56:01,233 --> 00:56:03,392
The loom provides,

543
00:56:03,486 --> 00:56:05,395
I interpret,

544
00:56:05,487 --> 00:56:06,685
you deliver.

545
00:56:07,990 --> 00:56:10,315
You want me to kill Robert Deane Darden?

546
00:56:12,911 --> 00:56:14,240
Not me.

547
00:56:15,747 --> 00:56:16,909
Fate.

548
00:56:24,340 --> 00:56:28,171
The target will be in the conference
room, sitting at the head chair.

549
00:56:28,260 --> 00:56:30,169
There are six windows.

550
00:56:30,679 --> 00:56:33,169
You will shoot through the fifth.

551
00:56:42,981 --> 00:56:44,524
Fifth window.

552
00:56:52,033 --> 00:56:53,195
Now.

553
00:57:17,098 --> 00:57:19,637
What did he do
that he deserves to die?

554
00:57:20,686 --> 00:57:22,263
You don't know.

555
00:57:23,313 --> 00:57:26,931
I don't know if he was bad,
I don't know if he was evil.

556
00:57:27,525 --> 00:57:29,898
I don't know anything about him.

557
00:57:31,071 --> 00:57:33,395
We get our orders from a loom.

558
00:57:34,282 --> 00:57:35,397
Fate.

559
00:57:35,742 --> 00:57:40,071
And we're supposed to take it on faith
that what we're doing is right.

560
00:57:41,622 --> 00:57:44,327
Killing someone we know nothing about,

561
00:57:46,502 --> 00:57:48,743
I don't know if I can do that.

562
00:58:01,142 --> 00:58:02,885
About 20 years ago,

563
00:58:04,353 --> 00:58:06,310
there was this girl.

564
00:58:07,439 --> 00:58:10,393
Her dad was a federal judge,

565
00:58:10,484 --> 00:58:15,193
so she probably had it in her mind
that she was gonna follow in his footsteps.

566
00:58:20,619 --> 00:58:22,861
So she's home one Christmas,

567
00:58:22,954 --> 00:58:25,956
and her dad's on this big racketeering case.

568
00:58:26,208 --> 00:58:29,291
The defendants want to get a softer judge.

569
00:58:29,753 --> 00:58:31,745
One they can buy off.

570
00:58:32,797 --> 00:58:34,837
So they hire this guy,

571
00:58:36,301 --> 00:58:37,925
Max Petridge,

572
00:58:39,428 --> 00:58:41,966
get him to pay her father a visit.

573
00:58:45,059 --> 00:58:47,728
And the way he pays people a visit

574
00:58:49,646 --> 00:58:50,679
is to break in ...

575
00:58:52,608 --> 00:58:55,016
and tie up their loved ones,

576
00:58:55,111 --> 00:58:57,399
and force them to watch ...

577
00:58:58,530 --> 00:59:01,104
while he burns his targets alive.

578
00:59:10,417 --> 00:59:13,785
And then he takes a wire hanger
and twists it round ...

579
00:59:14,921 --> 00:59:19,629
and brands his initials into each
one of them so they will never ever forget.

580
00:59:24,472 --> 00:59:27,343
After I was recruited into the Fraternity,

581
00:59:27,642 --> 00:59:30,762
I found out that Max Petridge's name
had come up ...

582
00:59:31,104 --> 00:59:34,104
weeks before the federal judge was killed,

583
00:59:34,815 --> 00:59:38,979
and that a Fraternity member
had failed to pull the trigger.

584
00:59:42,990 --> 00:59:46,490
We don't know how far
the ripples of our decisions go.

585
00:59:48,829 --> 00:59:51,037
You kill one, and maybe,

586
00:59:51,833 --> 00:59:53,457
save a thousand.

587
00:59:54,668 --> 00:59:57,373
That's the code of the Fraternity.

588
00:59:57,463 --> 01:00:01,046
That's what we believe in,
and that's why we do it.

589
01:00:22,196 --> 01:00:23,310
Now!

590
01:01:08,073 --> 01:01:09,353
Cross.

591
01:01:09,449 --> 01:01:10,729
Not yet.

592
01:01:13,495 --> 01:01:15,736
Your target will be in a black limo.

593
01:01:15,830 --> 01:01:18,535
He always travels the same
six blocks of Halsted.

594
01:01:18,625 --> 01:01:20,664
You have three blocks to kill him.

595
01:01:29,177 --> 01:01:30,375
Shit.

596
01:02:13,637 --> 01:02:15,629
I'm sorry.

597
01:02:33,573 --> 01:02:36,110
Barry! Could you feed Annabelle?

598
01:02:37,076 --> 01:02:38,405
Barry!

599
01:02:41,830 --> 01:02:46,824
Wesley. Hey, where have you been?
I have really missed you, man.

600
01:02:49,671 --> 01:02:53,041
Look at the big man.
You fucking asshole! What?

601
01:02:53,134 --> 01:02:54,332
What? You don't show up for weeks,

602
01:02:54,427 --> 01:02:57,048
now you're just gonna stop by
and use the bathroom?

603
01:02:57,137 --> 01:02:59,629
You think you're a real big shot now, huh?

604
01:02:59,723 --> 01:03:02,095
No. You know what? You are nothing!

605
01:03:02,184 --> 01:03:04,556
No, you are less than nothing.

606
01:03:05,020 --> 01:03:07,938
You're not even half the man that Barry is.

607
01:03:08,399 --> 01:03:12,478
Barry, he pleases me in ways
that you've never even heard of!

608
01:03:16,572 --> 01:03:19,692
Who the hell is she, Wesley?
Your new whore?

609
01:03:19,784 --> 01:03:23,035
Is that what it takes now?
You're paying for it?

610
01:03:55,569 --> 01:03:56,897
Wesley?

611
01:03:58,406 --> 01:03:59,900
He's the man.

612
01:04:08,916 --> 01:04:10,908
- You all right?
- Yeah.

613
01:04:11,001 --> 01:04:14,500
- Yeah. I'm okay.
- Go sit down. I'm gonna find a car.

614
01:04:14,588 --> 01:04:17,422
Big night. I got to get into recovery.

615
01:04:33,773 --> 01:04:34,971
Shit.

616
01:04:40,780 --> 01:04:41,942
Fuck!

617
01:06:22,545 --> 01:06:23,955
Bull's-eye.

618
01:06:26,091 --> 01:06:27,798
What's he doing here?

619
01:06:46,819 --> 01:06:48,976
- Come on!
- Come on. Just stay with us.

620
01:06:49,070 --> 01:06:50,482
Pull back his jacket.

621
01:06:55,117 --> 01:06:57,954
Breathe. Breathe, all right?

622
01:07:00,958 --> 01:07:04,706
It's all right. It's all right. It's all right.

623
01:07:04,794 --> 01:07:05,958
A thousand.

624
01:07:06,046 --> 01:07:07,421
Come on!

625
01:07:09,173 --> 01:07:11,213
- Come on!
- No! No! Stay with us.

626
01:07:11,301 --> 01:07:12,415
- Come on.
- Open your eyes!

627
01:07:12,510 --> 01:07:13,838
Come on!

628
01:07:14,887 --> 01:07:15,967
Come on!

629
01:07:17,223 --> 01:07:18,633
Come on!

630
01:08:08,940 --> 01:08:12,523
This bullet is the first traceable bullet
he's ever used.

631
01:08:14,028 --> 01:08:17,232
It was made by this man.
His name is Pekwarsky.

632
01:08:17,323 --> 01:08:20,822
He works out of what is now
a monastery in Eastern Moravia.

633
01:08:20,909 --> 01:08:23,827
This place is where the Fraternity was born.

634
01:08:28,876 --> 01:08:30,833
He's taunting me.

635
01:08:30,920 --> 01:08:32,960
He's sending me a message.

636
01:08:33,047 --> 01:08:34,541
I'm gonna send him one back.

637
01:08:34,632 --> 01:08:36,541
He's trapping you.

638
01:08:36,634 --> 01:08:39,006
Leading you to a place he knows very well.

639
01:08:39,094 --> 01:08:40,968
Look, I know this. I ...

640
01:08:43,098 --> 01:08:45,671
This is what you trained me for.

641
01:08:45,767 --> 01:08:47,143
You can't go alone.

642
01:08:47,227 --> 01:08:50,346
I go alone or he doesn't show.
He's not stupid.

643
01:08:50,730 --> 01:08:55,392
Look, a member of the Fraternity
is dead because of me.

644
01:09:00,907 --> 01:09:02,023
Okay.

645
01:09:04,369 --> 01:09:05,483
Go.

646
01:09:09,374 --> 01:09:10,784
Thank you.

647
01:09:18,633 --> 01:09:21,205
I don't think that's a good idea.

648
01:09:30,978 --> 01:09:32,805
Your next assignment.

649
01:10:32,413 --> 01:10:33,742
Pekwarsky?

650
01:10:48,929 --> 01:10:50,043
Shit.

651
01:10:58,022 --> 01:11:00,014
What are you doing here?

652
01:11:01,274 --> 01:11:02,934
Lower your gun.

653
01:11:13,411 --> 01:11:15,285
You recognise this?

654
01:11:15,997 --> 01:11:17,277
I pulled this out of my shoulder.

655
01:11:17,373 --> 01:11:19,946
The guy who put it there killed my father.

656
01:11:20,042 --> 01:11:22,248
Now, I know you made it,
so tell me where he is.

657
01:11:22,336 --> 01:11:26,285
I did mould this, but I can't be responsible
for the people who use them.

658
01:11:26,381 --> 01:11:29,383
I don't give a shit. Tell me where he is.

659
01:11:29,469 --> 01:11:31,128
Look at my finger.

660
01:11:32,846 --> 01:11:35,847
I can try and arrange a meet.

661
01:11:59,081 --> 01:12:02,165
Have you ever thought about
doing things differently?

662
01:12:02,250 --> 01:12:03,875
How do you mean?

663
01:12:03,961 --> 01:12:05,502
I don't know.

664
01:12:06,504 --> 01:12:08,662
Being somebody else.

665
01:12:09,674 --> 01:12:11,666
Somebody normal.

666
01:12:18,807 --> 01:12:19,887
No.

667
01:12:25,856 --> 01:12:27,018
Shit.

668
01:12:28,858 --> 01:12:30,437
Out of the way!

669
01:13:00,766 --> 01:13:01,964
Stay.

670
01:13:22,786 --> 01:13:23,900
Hey!

671
01:13:26,206 --> 01:13:27,997
He's on the train.

672
01:13:28,416 --> 01:13:29,829
He's alone.

673
01:13:30,253 --> 01:13:31,663
Thank you.

674
01:13:55,068 --> 01:13:56,645
Sorry. I'm sorry. Sit down!

675
01:13:56,736 --> 01:13:59,226
Sir, sit down! Nobody's gonna get hurt.

676
01:13:59,571 --> 01:14:02,408
Sir, sit ... Sit down! Sir, sit down!

677
01:14:14,461 --> 01:14:17,332
Get out of the way! Sit down!
Stay down! Stay down!

678
01:14:17,423 --> 01:14:19,249
Stay down! It's okay! Sit down!

679
01:14:29,767 --> 01:14:31,049
Wesley.

680
01:14:39,736 --> 01:14:42,025
Out of the way! Out of the way!

681
01:15:53,433 --> 01:15:55,092
No, no, no!

682
01:18:30,877 --> 01:18:33,583
Wesley, listen to me.

683
01:18:33,673 --> 01:18:35,629
Shut the fuck up!

684
01:18:35,716 --> 01:18:37,874
You don't get to talk to me.

685
01:18:37,967 --> 01:18:39,510
You don't get to talk to me.

686
01:18:39,595 --> 01:18:42,381
Everything they told you was a lie.

687
01:18:43,264 --> 01:18:46,598
Shut up, you lying piece of shit.
You shut the fuck up.

688
01:18:47,560 --> 01:18:49,185
You are my son.

689
01:18:54,233 --> 01:18:55,893
What did you say?

690
01:18:56,485 --> 01:18:58,525
What did you say to me?

691
01:19:30,310 --> 01:19:31,804
Is it true?

692
01:19:34,482 --> 01:19:35,644
Yes.

693
01:19:39,987 --> 01:19:41,481
Why did you make me do this?

694
01:19:41,571 --> 01:19:44,775
Because you are the only person
he wouldn't kill.

695
01:19:49,746 --> 01:19:51,537
You knew, God damn it.

696
01:19:51,873 --> 01:19:53,912
You knew the entire time.

697
01:19:55,043 --> 01:19:56,951
Well, his name came up.

698
01:19:58,962 --> 01:20:00,587
So did yours.

699
01:20:46,801 --> 01:20:48,959
No, it was okay. Never mind.

700
01:20:50,388 --> 01:20:53,009
No. No, it was complete shit.

701
01:21:13,702 --> 01:21:15,944
I promised your father
I'd bring you back here.

702
01:21:16,038 --> 01:21:17,580
What the fuck?

703
01:21:18,749 --> 01:21:21,785
He said it was the only way you'd believe.

704
01:21:29,091 --> 01:21:32,461
Your father was never more than
a camera click away.

705
01:21:49,570 --> 01:21:50,899
That's me.

706
01:21:55,117 --> 01:21:56,861
He was my father.

707
01:21:59,162 --> 01:22:00,871
And I killed him.

708
01:22:00,956 --> 01:22:05,202
To your father, protecting you
was worth giving up his life.

709
01:22:06,462 --> 01:22:07,873
Protect me?

710
01:22:08,672 --> 01:22:11,045
He was trying to fucking kill me!

711
01:22:11,134 --> 01:22:14,798
No. He wasn't trying to kill you.

712
01:22:15,554 --> 01:22:17,712
He was trying to rescue you.

713
01:22:23,687 --> 01:22:26,178
When Cross left the Fraternity,

714
01:22:26,273 --> 01:22:28,229
Sloan hunted you down.

715
01:22:30,067 --> 01:22:34,943
Ever since Fox had her teeth in you,
he's been trying to separate you from them.

716
01:22:37,743 --> 01:22:41,242
Your father never wanted you
in the Fraternity, Wesley.

717
01:22:42,414 --> 01:22:45,082
He wanted a different path for you,

718
01:22:50,379 --> 01:22:53,084
with things that he could never have.

719
01:22:53,799 --> 01:22:55,127
A home.

720
01:22:56,093 --> 01:22:57,753
- Peace.
- No.

721
01:22:58,387 --> 01:23:01,341
He hoped you would find your own way.

722
01:23:07,939 --> 01:23:10,263
Your father got hold of this.

723
01:23:12,235 --> 01:23:14,227
Decipher it yourself.

724
01:23:21,452 --> 01:23:25,947
Sloan began manufacturing targets
of his own for profit years ago.

725
01:23:27,958 --> 01:23:30,282
Your father found out about it.

726
01:23:30,793 --> 01:23:33,119
And he was going to do something about it
on his own, right?

727
01:23:33,212 --> 01:23:36,047
But Sloan turned everyone against him.

728
01:23:36,131 --> 01:23:38,588
My father's name
never even came up, did it?

729
01:23:38,718 --> 01:23:41,720
No. Holding to the code made him a target.

730
01:23:46,350 --> 01:23:47,465
Yes.

731
01:24:01,907 --> 01:24:04,279
- You want me to run?
- No.

732
01:24:04,951 --> 01:24:06,742
I want you to live.

733
01:24:08,122 --> 01:24:10,873
You can have a different life, Wesley.

734
01:24:11,792 --> 01:24:14,330
Like your father wanted for you.

735
01:25:41,129 --> 01:25:42,955
We trained him well.

736
01:26:26,839 --> 01:26:29,128
My father was wrong
about one thing.

737
01:26:29,217 --> 01:26:31,921
Everything they told me wasn't a lie.

738
01:26:32,011 --> 01:26:35,297
They taught me how to kill,
how to feel no pain,

739
01:26:35,389 --> 01:26:39,340
and most importantly,
that every job has a perfect weapon.

740
01:26:42,897 --> 01:26:45,471
Well, I'm the perfect weapon.

741
01:26:47,526 --> 01:26:49,603
And I'm supposed to run?

742
01:26:49,696 --> 01:26:52,268
No, I've been doing that my entire life.

743
01:26:52,823 --> 01:26:54,199
So I say no.

744
01:26:55,159 --> 01:26:58,741
I say kill them all
and let fate sort out the mess.

745
01:27:53,632 --> 01:27:54,913
Kill him.

746
01:28:48,018 --> 01:28:49,393
He's here!

747
01:31:59,454 --> 01:32:00,734
Pussy.

748
01:32:02,081 --> 01:32:03,825
Pussy, pussy.

749
01:32:18,265 --> 01:32:19,723
Pussy, pussy.

750
01:32:24,771 --> 01:32:26,051
Pussy.

751
01:33:31,460 --> 01:33:33,749
Sloan!

752
01:33:51,688 --> 01:33:54,014
My father wasn't a traitor.

753
01:33:57,444 --> 01:33:59,271
This is a kill order.

754
01:34:01,948 --> 01:34:04,274
And it's got Sloan's name on it.

755
01:34:07,703 --> 01:34:09,696
What did you say to me?

756
01:34:10,373 --> 01:34:12,614
It's a name. It's a target.

757
01:34:15,712 --> 01:34:18,037
I don't want this person dead.

758
01:34:18,924 --> 01:34:20,418
Fate does.

759
01:34:23,929 --> 01:34:26,051
Fate wanted you dead.

760
01:34:28,098 --> 01:34:29,759
And he couldn't take it.

761
01:34:29,851 --> 01:34:33,894
So he started manufacturing
his own targets for his own gains.

762
01:34:34,563 --> 01:34:38,726
And that's when my dad found out
and decided to stand against him.

763
01:34:39,777 --> 01:34:43,524
And that's when you sent a man's son ...

764
01:34:43,613 --> 01:34:45,523
to kill his father.

765
01:34:48,577 --> 01:34:51,412
You're not an assassin of fate, Sloan.

766
01:34:53,248 --> 01:34:56,000
You're just a thug who can bend bullets.

767
01:35:12,558 --> 01:35:14,100
Is that true?

768
01:35:21,067 --> 01:35:23,190
Here is what the truth is.

769
01:35:27,239 --> 01:35:28,817
Your name came up.

770
01:35:40,044 --> 01:35:41,751
Your name came up.

771
01:35:57,018 --> 01:35:58,761
Your name came up.

772
01:36:00,772 --> 01:36:02,100
Your name.

773
01:36:03,691 --> 01:36:05,102
Your name.

774
01:36:05,777 --> 01:36:07,105
Yours.

775
01:36:08,279 --> 01:36:10,568
Everyone in this room.

776
01:36:16,121 --> 01:36:18,611
If I had not done what I did,

777
01:36:20,959 --> 01:36:22,951
you would all be dead.

778
01:36:25,588 --> 01:36:27,580
I saved your lives.

779
01:36:29,258 --> 01:36:33,207
Now look where we are.
We are stronger than ever.

780
01:36:34,429 --> 01:36:37,430
Changing the course of history as we see it.

781
01:36:39,434 --> 01:36:41,806
Choosing the targets we select.

782
01:36:43,813 --> 01:36:47,728
We can redistribute power where we see fit.

783
01:36:50,278 --> 01:36:51,856
The wolves rule.

784
01:36:53,782 --> 01:36:55,324
Not the sheep.

785
01:36:57,369 --> 01:37:00,703
Now, if any of you feel
the need to follow the code ...

786
01:37:00,789 --> 01:37:03,244
of the Fraternity to the letter,

787
01:37:05,251 --> 01:37:07,824
I invite you to take your gun,

788
01:37:07,920 --> 01:37:10,791
put it in your mouth and pull the trigger.

789
01:37:14,885 --> 01:37:17,093
That is what Wesley demands.

790
01:37:18,765 --> 01:37:20,140
Otherwise,

791
01:37:20,766 --> 01:37:22,640
shoot this motherfucker ...

792
01:37:22,727 --> 01:37:26,013
and let us take our
Fraternity of Assassins to heights ...

793
01:37:26,105 --> 01:37:28,726
reserved only for the gods of men.

794
01:37:32,611 --> 01:37:34,022
You choose.

795
01:37:49,086 --> 01:37:50,663
Fuck the code.

796
01:38:54,441 --> 01:38:56,267
Sloan!

797
01:39:21,467 --> 01:39:23,958
Sloan!

798
01:39:40,443 --> 01:39:44,144
Six weeks ago,
I was ordinary and pathetic.

799
01:39:46,282 --> 01:39:47,908
Just like you.

800
01:39:51,121 --> 01:39:52,781
But who am I now?

801
01:39:55,292 --> 01:39:56,916
Account manager?

802
01:39:59,296 --> 01:40:00,624
Assassin?

803
01:40:02,631 --> 01:40:06,843
Or just another tool who was
mind-fucked into killing his father?

804
01:40:08,846 --> 01:40:10,506
I am all of these.

805
01:40:11,765 --> 01:40:13,474
And I am none of these.

806
01:40:16,228 --> 01:40:17,805
Who am I now?

807
01:40:49,261 --> 01:40:51,882
This is not me fulfilling my destiny.

808
01:40:57,060 --> 01:41:00,061
This is not me following
in my father's footsteps.

809
01:41:04,567 --> 01:41:07,520
This is definitely not me saving the world.

810
01:41:26,172 --> 01:41:28,924
Still trying to figure out who you are?

811
01:41:30,092 --> 01:41:32,168
This is not me.

812
01:41:35,055 --> 01:41:37,592
This is just a motherfucking decoy.

813
01:41:44,231 --> 01:41:45,606
Oh, fuck.

814
01:41:50,112 --> 01:41:52,519
This is me taking control.

815
01:41:53,948 --> 01:41:55,573
From Sloan,

816
01:41:56,368 --> 01:41:58,241
from the Fraternity,

817
01:41:58,619 --> 01:42:02,119
from Janice, from billing reports,

818
01:42:02,707 --> 01:42:04,913
from ergonomic keyboards,

819
01:42:05,001 --> 01:42:08,665
from cheating girlfriends
and sack-of-shit best friends.

820
01:42:10,464 --> 01:42:13,299
This is me taking back control ...

821
01:42:14,050 --> 01:42:15,593
of my life.

822
01:42:19,266 --> 01:42:22,359
What the fuck
have you done lately?

1
00:03:08,288 --> 00:03:11,223
This is
the story of my older brother's...

2
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:14,692
strange criminal behavior
and disappearance.

3
00:03:14,761 --> 00:03:17,696
We who loved him
no longer speak of Wade.

4
00:03:17,764 --> 00:03:20,756
It's as if he never existed.

5
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:24,997
By telling his story like this,
by breaking the silence about him,

6
00:03:25,071 --> 00:03:27,164
I tell my own story as well.

7
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,367
Everything of importance,

8
00:03:29,442 --> 00:03:32,878
that is everything that gives rise
to the telling of this story,

9
00:03:32,946 --> 00:03:35,346
occurred during a single
deer-hunting season...

10
00:03:35,415 --> 00:03:39,749
in a small town in upstate New Hampshire
where Wade was raised,

11
00:03:39,819 --> 00:03:41,912
and so was I.

12
00:03:41,988 --> 00:03:46,084
One night something changed,
and my relation
to Wade's story was different...

13
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:48,992
from what it had been
since childhood.

14
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:51,292
I mark this change
by Wade's tone of voice...

15
00:03:51,364 --> 00:03:54,356
during a phone call
a night after Halloween.

16
00:03:54,434 --> 00:03:57,232
Something I had not heard before.

17
00:03:57,303 --> 00:04:00,704
Let us imagine that around 8:00
on Halloween Eve...

18
00:04:00,773 --> 00:04:05,210
comes a pale blue, eight-year-old
Plymouth with a police bubble on top.

19
00:04:05,278 --> 00:04:09,305
A square-faced man wearing
a police jacket is driving the vehicle.

20
00:04:09,382 --> 00:04:11,316
Beside him sits a child,

21
00:04:11,384 --> 00:04:15,445
a little girl with
a plastic tiger mask covering her face.

22
00:04:16,789 --> 00:04:19,553
Sorry for the screw-up.
I couldn't help it.

23
00:04:19,626 --> 00:04:22,493
It's too late
to go trick or treating.

24
00:04:22,562 --> 00:04:26,760
I had to stop at Penney's to get
your costume, then you were hungry.

25
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:29,768
Whose fault is it then
if it's not yours?

26
00:04:29,836 --> 00:04:31,827
You're the one in charge, Dad.

27
00:04:31,904 --> 00:04:33,895
Yeah.

28
00:04:33,973 --> 00:04:38,307
Look, those kids are still
trick-or-treating. They're still out.

29
00:04:38,378 --> 00:04:42,940
- Those are the Hoyts.
- I don't care. They're out!

30
00:04:43,016 --> 00:04:46,383
Can't you see? Look out there.
It's just too late.

31
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:50,548
Those Hoyt kids,
they're just out to get in trouble.

32
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:54,320
See, look. They put shaving cream
all over that mailbox.

33
00:04:54,394 --> 00:04:57,454
- Why did they do that?
- Do what?

34
00:04:57,530 --> 00:04:59,930
- You know.
- Break stuff?

35
00:04:59,999 --> 00:05:02,297
Yeah. It's stupid.

36
00:05:02,368 --> 00:05:05,769
Well... I guess
they're stupid.

37
00:05:05,838 --> 00:05:08,329
Did you do that stuff
when you were a kid?

38
00:05:08,408 --> 00:05:10,433
No!

39
00:05:11,744 --> 00:05:13,803
Well, sort of.

40
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:17,839
Nothing really mean.
Me and my pals. Me and my brothers.

41
00:05:17,917 --> 00:05:20,147
It was kind of funny then.

42
00:05:20,219 --> 00:05:24,656
- But it's not funny now.
- No, no. It's not funny now.

43
00:05:24,724 --> 00:05:27,921
I'm a cop. I gotta listen to
the complaints people make.

44
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:30,861
I'm not a kid anymore.
You change.

45
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:33,899
I bet you did a lot of bad stuff
when you were a kid.

46
00:05:33,966 --> 00:05:35,991
What are you
talking about?

47
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:40,096
- I don't know.
I just think you used to be bad.
- No.

48
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:42,835
No.

49
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:45,707
I didn't used to be bad.

50
00:05:45,778 --> 00:05:48,508
No, sir!

51
00:05:48,581 --> 00:05:51,106
Where do you get this stuff from?
Your mother?

52
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:54,642
No. She doesn't talk
about you anymore.

53
00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:28,280
Hey, Wade.

54
00:06:36,329 --> 00:06:39,298
Ladies and gentlemen,
LaRiviere Company...

55
00:06:39,365 --> 00:06:44,029
is proud to sponsor another
annual Lawford costume parade.

56
00:06:44,103 --> 00:06:48,130
We are looking for the funniest costume,
the scariest...

57
00:06:48,207 --> 00:06:51,506
Oh, the scariest!
Is he the scariest? Is that one scary?

58
00:06:51,577 --> 00:06:53,636
What about this?
Is he scary?

59
00:06:53,713 --> 00:06:57,706
No, no. Here's the scary one
right there.

60
00:06:57,784 --> 00:07:00,912
The most imaginative
and the best costume of all.

61
00:07:00,987 --> 00:07:03,080
Help me line the kids up.

62
00:07:03,156 --> 00:07:06,250
- Pretty awesome, huh? Hi, Marge.
- Hi, Wade.

63
00:07:06,325 --> 00:07:09,453
Go ahead, jump in line.
Maybe you'll win a prize.

64
00:07:10,696 --> 00:07:14,462
Go on. Some of those kids
you still know!

65
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:19,833
- I don't want to.
- Oh, why? Why not?

66
00:07:19,906 --> 00:07:22,397
You know these kids
from when you went to school here.

67
00:07:22,475 --> 00:07:24,670
It hasn't been that long.

68
00:07:24,744 --> 00:07:27,042
- It's not that.
- What then?

69
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:31,015
I don't like it here.

70
00:07:31,083 --> 00:07:35,577
Oh, Jesus, Jill, come on.
Don't mess this up any more
than it's been messed up.

71
00:07:35,655 --> 00:07:40,058
Join the kids. You do that, before
you know you'll be happy as a clam.

72
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:41,525
Wade!

73
00:07:41,594 --> 00:07:45,826
Is that Jill?
Come on and join us. Come on!

74
00:07:45,898 --> 00:07:49,891
Go, go, go.
Go on. Go, go, go.

75
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:52,301
That's it, come on.
Come on.

76
00:07:52,371 --> 00:07:54,601
Here, make a place for her
on the stage.

77
00:07:54,674 --> 00:07:57,734
Look out! Here comes a tiger!
She's coming through.

78
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:02,770
- What are you boys up to?
- Same old shit.

79
00:08:02,849 --> 00:08:06,148
You seen the damage these little
sons of bitches been raising tonight?

80
00:08:06,219 --> 00:08:09,279
- Gonna have to move your pickup.
- I know.

81
00:08:09,355 --> 00:08:14,315
- Take a bite.
- Could use it. Don't mind of I do.

82
00:08:14,393 --> 00:08:17,885
LaRiviere's having
a hell of a time in there tonight.

83
00:08:17,964 --> 00:08:19,932
Master of fucking ceremonies.

84
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:22,661
Where's that gun
you were bragging on today?

85
00:08:22,735 --> 00:08:25,329
Let's look at it.

86
00:08:34,046 --> 00:08:37,607
Oh, ho-ho-ho.
Oh, ho-ho.

87
00:08:38,918 --> 00:08:42,445
Mmm! Got you
for $650, $700?

88
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:45,457
- Nice.
- See you got Jill tonight.

89
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:49,017
How'd you manage that?

90
00:08:52,732 --> 00:08:55,530
Don't forget to move your truck.

91
00:08:57,169 --> 00:09:00,104
Ladies and gentlemen,
remember, there are no losers.

92
00:09:00,172 --> 00:09:02,140
Everybody gets a nice ribbon.

93
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:05,405
Now, here is our first award.
For the most imaginative...

94
00:09:10,449 --> 00:09:12,417
Alma, have you seen Jill?

95
00:09:12,485 --> 00:09:15,511
She's around somewhere.
Are you coming to see me next week?

96
00:09:15,588 --> 00:09:17,522
Yeah.

97
00:09:32,638 --> 00:09:34,970
Some party, huh?

98
00:09:36,509 --> 00:09:41,208
I'm sorry.
I had to step outside for a smoke.

99
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:45,011
Find anybody you know? There must be
some kids you know from school.

100
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:49,647
Say, you want to go tomorrow?
See your old teachers?

101
00:09:49,722 --> 00:09:51,656
- No.
- No what?

102
00:09:51,724 --> 00:09:56,457
No, I didn't see anybody I knew.
No, I don't want to go
to school here tomorrow!

103
00:09:56,529 --> 00:10:01,694
- I want to go home.
- Come on, Jill, you are home!

104
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:04,634
There's lots of kids
you still know here.

105
00:10:04,704 --> 00:10:08,697
Don't worry, Dad.
I love you. I do!

106
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:10,799
But I want to go home.

107
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:26,151
All right, I tell you what.

108
00:10:26,225 --> 00:10:30,457
Tomorrow morning
if you still want to go home,
I'll drive you when I get off work.

109
00:10:30,529 --> 00:10:32,724
Okay?

110
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:36,359
- I called Mom.
- What? You called Mommy?

111
00:10:36,435 --> 00:10:38,403
- Just now?
- Yeah.

112
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:41,269
Jesus, why?
Why didn't you talk to me first?

113
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:45,174
- I knew you'd be mad.
- Well, yeah, honey, I am mad.

114
00:10:45,244 --> 00:10:47,804
You know.
What did you tell her, for chrissake?

115
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:50,178
I told her I wanted to come home.

116
00:10:50,249 --> 00:10:53,343
Dad, don't be mad at me.

117
00:10:53,419 --> 00:10:56,411
Well, I guess I am.

118
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:59,583
I mean, you know.

119
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:03,891
I planned this.
I planned all this.

120
00:11:03,963 --> 00:11:08,263
Sort of pathetic. But I planned it.

121
00:11:11,037 --> 00:11:13,096
You shouldn't have
called your mother.

122
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:16,403
Come on, we're gonna call her
before she leaves.

123
00:11:36,228 --> 00:11:38,423
Hi, this is the Horners.

124
00:11:38,497 --> 00:11:41,330
- Please leave a message at the beep.
- She's gone already.

125
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:44,096
Gone already!
She couldn't wait.

126
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:50,365
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

127
00:11:50,443 --> 00:11:53,844
That's all you've got to say,
is "yeah"?

128
00:11:53,913 --> 00:11:56,177
Yeah.

129
00:12:04,356 --> 00:12:07,450
You know, she won't be here
for a half hour.

130
00:12:07,526 --> 00:12:11,656
- Think you can stand it that long?
- Yeah.

131
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:15,458
Where do you expect
to wait for her?

132
00:12:15,534 --> 00:12:18,560
Obviously downstairs with
the other kids isn't good enough.

133
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:33,344
Sit there by yourself
if you want.

134
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:36,877
Wait for her by yourself!
That's fine with me. Just dandy!

135
00:12:36,956 --> 00:12:39,823
- I'm goin' downstairs.
- It's fine with me too.

136
00:12:39,892 --> 00:12:42,918
When Mom comes,
tell her I'm up here.

137
00:12:57,510 --> 00:13:00,104
I thought I told you
to move that goddamn truck!

138
00:13:01,547 --> 00:13:03,913
Relax, Chief.
We're leavin' now.

139
00:13:03,983 --> 00:13:06,213
You want a toke?

140
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:09,448
No, Jesus Christ, Jack!

141
00:13:12,725 --> 00:13:15,193
Why don't you get
the fuck outta here?

142
00:13:15,261 --> 00:13:18,355
If Gordon or one of those guys see
you smoke that wacky tabacky around me,

143
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:21,058
they'll expect me to bust you,
and I'll be out of a goddamn job.

144
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:23,431
Some job!

145
00:13:23,502 --> 00:13:27,563
Here, have a hit.
Don't be such a hardass.

146
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:31,736
I know you got problems.
We all got problems, so relax.

147
00:13:32,778 --> 00:13:34,837
Not here.

148
00:13:34,914 --> 00:13:39,442
Well, come on, get in.
We'll take a little ride, my man.

149
00:13:43,122 --> 00:13:46,785
Got a job. First thing
in the morning. First day of season.

150
00:13:46,859 --> 00:13:49,293
Twombley something. Erwin...

151
00:13:49,361 --> 00:13:52,489
Evan? He's
a union official from Massachusetts.

152
00:13:52,565 --> 00:13:54,499
You're lucky.

153
00:13:54,567 --> 00:13:57,127
Gotta guarantee a kill, of course.

154
00:13:57,203 --> 00:14:00,138
Which I can do. There are
some monster bucks hidin' out up there.

155
00:14:00,206 --> 00:14:02,868
- How'd you get the job?
- Gordon.

156
00:14:02,942 --> 00:14:05,604
He's always got
some angle workin'.

157
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:09,842
He wants to keep Twombley happy,
I'm his boy.

158
00:14:09,915 --> 00:14:13,510
- What's wrong with you?
- A toothache.

159
00:14:13,586 --> 00:14:17,147
You should get close to him, Jack.

160
00:14:17,223 --> 00:14:20,386
Make yourself irreplaceable.
The guy is loaded.

161
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:24,623
Like you and Gordon?

162
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:29,361
Right. The son of a bitch
couldn't get along without me.

163
00:14:29,435 --> 00:14:32,268
Yeah, he'd go broke tomorrow
if you quit him.

164
00:14:32,338 --> 00:14:35,739
Right.

165
00:14:35,808 --> 00:14:38,038
Bastard's got his high beams on.
- Shit!

166
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:39,737
What?

167
00:14:39,812 --> 00:14:44,442
- That's my ex-wife Lillian
and her husband in the Audi.
- Audi's a good car.

168
00:14:44,516 --> 00:14:48,145
- What's she here for?
- She's here to get Jill.
Me and Jill had an argument.

169
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:51,018
Jack, I gotta get back to town.
Move this thing, will ya?

170
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:53,854
See if you can get back to the town hall
before they get there, okay?

171
00:14:53,926 --> 00:14:58,590
- Piece of cake.
- Take this joint.

172
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:08,172
Lillian?

173
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,141
Lillian.

174
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:14,270
Where's Jill?

175
00:15:14,346 --> 00:15:16,940
Me and Jill,
we had a little spat.

176
00:15:17,016 --> 00:15:19,849
She kind of felt left out
from not knowing the new kids.

177
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:22,752
Where is she? Is she
in the truck with your friends?

178
00:15:22,821 --> 00:15:27,622
No. She told me she wanted
to wait for you inside.

179
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:32,591
While you went for
a few beers with your friends.

180
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:37,631
That Hettie Rogers in there
with what's-his-name?

181
00:15:37,703 --> 00:15:39,637
Yeah.

182
00:15:39,705 --> 00:15:43,334
Boy, she's grown up
a little, hasn't she?

183
00:15:43,409 --> 00:15:45,400
Jesus, lay off, will ya?

184
00:15:45,477 --> 00:15:50,005
You've won this round,
so just lay off, for chrissake.

185
00:15:50,082 --> 00:15:55,213
You amaze me.
Year after year in the same old ways.

186
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:01,483
Horner, leave her be.

187
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:04,620
It's got nothing to do with you,
so just act like a chauffeur.

188
00:16:04,697 --> 00:16:07,564
- You got it?
- Wade, nobody wants any trouble.

189
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:09,658
Listen to me.
I don't want her to go.

190
00:16:09,735 --> 00:16:13,330
Please don't make a scene.
Nobody is trying to win any round.

191
00:16:13,405 --> 00:16:15,464
Don't make this any worse.

192
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:18,066
- I'm not making it any worse. You are!
- Me?

193
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:20,634
Me and Jill,
we could've worked this out.

194
00:16:20,713 --> 00:16:23,443
- It's normal.
It's a father-daughter thing.
- She called me.

195
00:16:23,515 --> 00:16:27,315
I know she called you.
How do you think this makes me look?

196
00:16:27,353 --> 00:16:31,551
- Coming up here and treating her
like some tragic victim.
- I'm not gonna do this.

197
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:34,252
Just wait till
we're through, goddamn it!

198
00:16:40,065 --> 00:16:42,260
Don't say a word.

199
00:16:45,471 --> 00:16:47,666
I didn't hit him.

200
00:16:52,811 --> 00:16:55,473
I'm not gonna hit anybody.

201
00:17:26,812 --> 00:17:30,339
New hat!

202
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:34,113
- Jill's up, I see.
- Yeah, for a while.

203
00:17:34,186 --> 00:17:38,680
- How's she doing?
- She's okay. She's fine.

204
00:17:38,757 --> 00:17:42,523
You two want to do anything, need
a third party, give me a call. I'm off.

205
00:17:42,594 --> 00:17:45,654
Like hell you are. Tomorrow's
the first day of deer-huntin' season.

206
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:49,394
I'll need you at least in the mornin'.
Take care, Wade.

207
00:17:49,468 --> 00:17:52,926
Well, I guess that's that.

208
00:17:53,005 --> 00:17:55,337
You be careful
of that little bastard.

209
00:17:55,407 --> 00:18:00,140
- He's dyin' to get in your pants.
- Come on. Give me a break.

210
00:18:01,213 --> 00:18:03,443
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Okay.

211
00:18:12,825 --> 00:18:15,988
- Tomorrow, Gordon.
- Hmm.

212
00:18:16,061 --> 00:18:20,088
Watch the snow.
It's coming down tonight.

213
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:35,478
This weather
any advantage in tracking the bastards?

214
00:18:35,547 --> 00:18:38,107
Don't worry, Mr. Twombley,
I know where those suckers are.

215
00:18:38,183 --> 00:18:41,243
Right about now, the does
are holding up in the brush piles.

216
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:43,982
The bucks are
right behind the does.

217
00:18:44,056 --> 00:18:46,024
We're right behind the bucks.

218
00:18:46,091 --> 00:18:49,492
That gun gets fired before 10:00.

219
00:18:49,561 --> 00:18:53,463
Whether it kills a deer or not,
more or less up to you.

220
00:18:53,532 --> 00:18:57,628
I'll put you inside 30, 35 yards of
a buck first four hours of the season.

221
00:18:57,703 --> 00:19:01,571
- That's what you're
paying me for, ain't it?
- Damn straight.

222
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:05,667
Done much shootin'
with that rifle yet?

223
00:19:05,744 --> 00:19:10,306
I'll tell you what, kid.
You get me close to a big buck
by 10:00 in the mornin',

224
00:19:10,382 --> 00:19:12,907
there's an extra $100 in it.

225
00:19:14,086 --> 00:19:17,419
- If you get it?
- Yeah.

226
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:19,889
- You might not kill it.
- You think so?

227
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:23,724
You might gut-shoot it. Cripple it
for somebody else to find and tag.

228
00:19:23,795 --> 00:19:28,061
Can't guarantee that won't happen,
especially with a new gun.

229
00:19:29,234 --> 00:19:31,566
I may have to shoot it.

230
00:19:31,637 --> 00:19:35,368
- You take care of your end,
I'll take care of mine.
- Mm-hmm.

231
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,408
You understand what I'm sayin'?

232
00:19:37,476 --> 00:19:41,776
- I want a deer, a dead one.
Not a cripple.
- I get it.

233
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:45,908
No sweat. You'll get yourself
a deer, dead, by coffee time.

234
00:19:45,984 --> 00:19:50,114
- And you'll get your extra $100.
- Wonderful.

235
00:19:56,295 --> 00:19:59,628
- Good morning, Jason.
- Good morning, Miss Brooks.

236
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:03,297
Morning.

237
00:20:06,004 --> 00:20:08,097
Hi, Melanie.

238
00:20:11,143 --> 00:20:13,634
Wade? Where's Jill?

239
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:16,306
I thought she was coming
to school today.

240
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:21,178
Don't worry, Dad. I love you. I do!

241
00:20:21,253 --> 00:20:24,416
But I don't want to go
to school here tomorrow.

242
00:20:36,134 --> 00:20:40,366
For Pete's sake, Whitehouse,
we ain't got all day!

243
00:20:50,716 --> 00:20:54,846
Are you okay, Wade? What was wrong?

244
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,946
Why were you holding everyone up?

245
00:20:58,023 --> 00:21:01,186
Did you see that son of a bitch in that
B.M.W? He could've killed somebody.

246
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,194
- Did you get his number?
- Yeah, I know who it is.

247
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:05,230
- Good.
- Mel Gordon.

248
00:21:05,297 --> 00:21:10,030
He's from Boston.
He's Evan Twombley's son-in-law.
They're headed to Lake Agaway.

249
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:14,198
The old man's out hunting with Jack.
I'm gonna spoil his weekend.

250
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:16,673
Now, Wade...

251
00:21:16,742 --> 00:21:19,905
- Safety on?
- Mm-hmm.

252
00:21:27,085 --> 00:21:29,417
I'm all right.

253
00:21:30,689 --> 00:21:33,681
Stay with me.
We'll cross into the next meadow.

254
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:36,421
I've seen you before.

255
00:21:36,495 --> 00:21:39,157
- I used to play ball.
- Yeah?

256
00:21:39,231 --> 00:21:42,928
- Drafted by the Red Sox.
- You played for the Sox?

257
00:21:43,001 --> 00:21:46,368
- Double-A. New Britain.
- Oh.

258
00:21:46,438 --> 00:21:51,034
Pitcher. Best ballplayer to come out
of New Hampshire since Carlton Fisk.

259
00:21:51,109 --> 00:21:54,237
- Really?
- They said.

260
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:59,410
Only difference between me
and that Clemens on TV is shit luck.

261
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:04,646
- Safety on?
- Yeah.

262
00:22:04,723 --> 00:22:08,181
- Just ahead.
- Sun's gettin' high.

263
00:22:09,895 --> 00:22:11,954
Deers have ears too, you know.

264
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:14,396
Oh, yeah.

265
00:22:49,434 --> 00:22:53,734
It's simple.
Either they clean up the trailer
or it gets hauled out.

266
00:22:53,805 --> 00:22:55,739
It looks like a piece of shit.

267
00:22:55,807 --> 00:22:58,139
That's right.
It's called mountain view.

268
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:00,701
Looks like shit view right now.

269
00:23:00,779 --> 00:23:03,543
Tell them if they don't move it,
I'll come out and have it moved.

270
00:23:03,615 --> 00:23:05,549
I gotta go. I'll call you later.

271
00:23:10,756 --> 00:23:13,554
Told you the snow was coming down.

272
00:23:13,625 --> 00:23:16,560
Take the grader.

273
00:23:16,628 --> 00:23:19,825
- Where's the plow?
- Jimmy took it.

274
00:23:19,898 --> 00:23:22,059
Jack's out hunting
with Evan Twombley.

275
00:23:22,134 --> 00:23:25,433
- His son-in-law damn near
killed me this morning.
- Huh?

276
00:23:25,504 --> 00:23:29,634
At the school crossing. Could've hurt
some kids. I'm gonna bust his ass!

277
00:23:29,708 --> 00:23:32,233
Don't go playing policeman.

278
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:35,609
What the hell am I?
A security guard?

279
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:39,047
I mean, you hired me.
You and your selectmen friends.

280
00:23:39,117 --> 00:23:42,780
You don't want
the extra police pay?

281
00:23:42,854 --> 00:23:45,618
I'm not sayin' that!

282
00:23:49,227 --> 00:23:51,695
Take the grader.
Go out 29 past Toby's.

283
00:23:51,763 --> 00:23:54,391
Don't let Lillian get to you.
She didn't belong here.

284
00:23:54,466 --> 00:23:56,491
- That's why she left.
- Fuck you.

285
00:23:56,568 --> 00:23:59,469
That's what I love
about a small town.

286
00:23:59,538 --> 00:24:02,234
You know everybody.

287
00:24:10,048 --> 00:24:12,312
Stay close.

288
00:24:15,353 --> 00:24:17,287
Fresh tracks.

289
00:24:19,491 --> 00:24:22,324
Deer shit. Big one.

290
00:24:22,394 --> 00:24:24,692
Here's your buck,
Mr. Twombley.

291
00:24:24,763 --> 00:24:26,924
I'll go down and circle around.

292
00:24:26,998 --> 00:24:32,095
You only got a little while
if you wanna collect that extra $100.

293
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:12,503
Hey. How's it goin'?

294
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:15,506
Cold. How do you think?

295
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:18,566
Yeah, sorry about that.
Tell me something.

296
00:26:18,643 --> 00:26:22,579
Why is it every year come first snow
you always get stuck with that grader?

297
00:26:22,647 --> 00:26:24,774
School. Traffic crossing.

298
00:26:24,849 --> 00:26:28,478
- So what are we doing after?
Digging wells?
- Yeah.

299
00:26:28,553 --> 00:26:31,386
Don't work too fast, all right?

300
00:26:31,456 --> 00:26:33,617
Business being the way it is,

301
00:26:33,692 --> 00:26:37,025
Gordon's looking for any reason
to lay me off earlier than usual.

302
00:26:37,095 --> 00:26:39,222
That border jumper's got too much money
as it is.

303
00:26:39,297 --> 00:26:42,630
I'll tell you who's a pisser.
Glen Whitehouse.

304
00:26:42,701 --> 00:26:44,635
He was mean normal.

305
00:26:44,703 --> 00:26:48,503
But when he drank,
it was like he burst on fire.

306
00:26:48,573 --> 00:26:53,135
Brown's Canadian.
Always drank B.C.

307
00:26:53,211 --> 00:26:56,977
One Christmas, there was this cord
of wood out back he'd forgotten about.

308
00:26:57,048 --> 00:27:00,142
He decides he's gonna have
his boys stack it.

309
00:27:00,218 --> 00:27:04,450
Except it's been out back
for two months. The wood's all iced in.

310
00:27:04,522 --> 00:27:08,583
He grabs the boys, throws them outside.
And he's drunk.

311
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:12,027
Oh! Come on, move it.

312
00:27:12,097 --> 00:27:15,225
Daylight in the swamp.

313
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:19,930
- Pop, the kids are waiting for us.
- Rolfe.

314
00:27:20,005 --> 00:27:23,941
A lesson in work
and its rewards.

315
00:27:24,009 --> 00:27:27,740
You'll thank me for this one day, boys.
Now, come on.

316
00:27:33,718 --> 00:27:35,811
Here we are, boys. Dig in.

317
00:27:35,887 --> 00:27:38,048
Come on, let's do it right over here.
See that?

318
00:27:38,123 --> 00:27:40,853
Goddamn it!
Let's do it!

319
00:27:40,925 --> 00:27:43,052
Show a little muscle there.
Come on.

320
00:27:45,363 --> 00:27:49,527
There! There we go.

321
00:27:49,601 --> 00:27:51,535
Attaboy. Come on!

322
00:27:51,603 --> 00:27:54,231
Please, Pop, let's go back.

323
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:57,574
What the hell are you,
a quitter?

324
00:27:57,642 --> 00:27:59,872
Huh? Get in there!

325
00:27:59,944 --> 00:28:02,469
Quitter? Huh? Huh?

326
00:28:02,547 --> 00:28:05,710
- So what happened?
- Oh, beats me.

327
00:28:05,784 --> 00:28:09,481
That's all I heard.
Wade would know more about it. Wade?

328
00:28:09,554 --> 00:28:13,923
We were just talkin' about your old man.
"What are you, a quitter?"

329
00:28:17,495 --> 00:28:22,694
Jesus, LaCoy, you got nothing better
to do than tell stories?

330
00:28:22,767 --> 00:28:26,965
The pity is, someday
some college student will come in here
and believe this shit...

331
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:30,701
'cause you're the only one
dumb enough to talk to him.

332
00:28:49,427 --> 00:28:52,555
That was some job.

333
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:57,067
We'll work at it, we promise.

334
00:28:57,135 --> 00:28:59,797
- I think I made a point.
- You just need a drink.

335
00:28:59,871 --> 00:29:02,135
What was that, Wade?

336
00:29:02,207 --> 00:29:05,608
You say something?

337
00:29:05,677 --> 00:29:09,135
You got something to say, say it.
Say it!

338
00:29:09,214 --> 00:29:11,239
You no good pup!

339
00:29:11,316 --> 00:29:13,216
Mom!

340
00:29:16,387 --> 00:29:19,083
- Well?
- Mom!

341
00:29:20,358 --> 00:29:22,622
Mom!

342
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:26,454
Mom! Mom!

343
00:29:40,979 --> 00:29:43,413
Don't look right.

344
00:29:43,481 --> 00:29:46,177
The sign.

345
00:29:46,251 --> 00:29:49,550
Looks like it's spelled wrong
or somethin'.

346
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:54,285
Ahh. Wade, Wade. It's people like you
who keep this town from prospering.

347
00:29:54,359 --> 00:29:56,919
I'm not finding fault. It's good
for you. It's good for the town.

348
00:29:56,995 --> 00:29:59,463
- It's a good idea.
- Yeah.

349
00:29:59,531 --> 00:30:03,228
What did you do? Hire one of
those hippie craftsman from Concord?

350
00:30:03,301 --> 00:30:05,235
Think you're gettin'
something you can use,

351
00:30:05,303 --> 00:30:07,771
only it turns out to be
a work of art?

352
00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:12,435
Whatever somebody does to improve things
around here, you gotta find fault.

353
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:14,603
- Is that it?
- Come on.

354
00:30:14,679 --> 00:30:18,877
I'm only sayin' there's something wrong
with "Homemade Cooking."

355
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:22,408
The sign's fine.
What it says is wrong.

356
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:25,081
Who needs it? Everybody that
comes here, been coming here for years.

357
00:30:25,156 --> 00:30:27,522
What do we need
a sign for?

358
00:30:27,592 --> 00:30:29,651
But I guess it's better
than what was there before.

359
00:30:29,727 --> 00:30:34,858
- What was there before?
- Nothin'.

360
00:30:34,933 --> 00:30:37,868
There was nothin' here before.

361
00:30:37,936 --> 00:30:39,870
Hmm.

362
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:44,031
- You okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

363
00:30:45,577 --> 00:30:48,410
I'm sorry about what I said.

364
00:30:48,479 --> 00:30:53,781
- What'd you say?
- About you and Jill
and needing a third person.

365
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:56,650
- She went back with Lillian?
- Yeah.

366
00:30:56,721 --> 00:30:59,918
- Yeah. Forget it.
- I'm sorry.

367
00:31:01,159 --> 00:31:04,526
I'm gonna start me
one of those custody suits.

368
00:31:04,596 --> 00:31:07,156
- I don't give a fucking shit anymore!
- You don't mean that.

369
00:31:07,232 --> 00:31:11,259
- Yeah, I do.
- No, you don't. You're just pissed.

370
00:31:11,336 --> 00:31:15,898
You just oughta cool off for a few days,
then have a long talk with Lillian.

371
00:31:15,974 --> 00:31:18,602
Work it out with her.
Tell her how you feel.

372
00:31:18,676 --> 00:31:21,304
- Lillian's not out to get you.
- The hell she isn't!

373
00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:25,008
Lillian's been trying to nail me
to a cross since the day I met her.

374
00:31:25,083 --> 00:31:30,077
I'm gonna get me a lawyer from Concord,
and get this divorce thing rearranged.

375
00:31:30,154 --> 00:31:33,783
- Marge?
- That goddamn woman.

376
00:31:33,858 --> 00:31:37,419
She thinks she can cart Jill off
and leave me alone like this.

377
00:31:37,495 --> 00:31:40,259
I'm a whole lot more than pissed.

378
00:31:40,331 --> 00:31:43,164
I've been there plenty in my life,
and I know the difference.

379
00:31:43,234 --> 00:31:45,327
And this is different.

380
00:31:45,403 --> 00:31:47,735
Marge, you got orders.

381
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:51,602
Call me.

382
00:31:51,676 --> 00:31:55,874
- Tonight. Let's get together tonight.
- Okay.

383
00:32:00,118 --> 00:32:03,576
- Talked to Jack?
- Nah. Not since last night.
He took a guy hunting.

384
00:32:03,655 --> 00:32:06,852
The fucker shot himself. Ker-bang!
That's what it sounded like.

385
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:08,950
Not on purpose.
I assume accidental.

386
00:32:09,027 --> 00:32:11,018
- Who? Jack?
- The other guy.

387
00:32:11,095 --> 00:32:13,222
- How'd you hear this?
- C.B., a little while ago.

388
00:32:13,298 --> 00:32:16,563
One of the boys comin' in. Jack on
the C.B. Callin' for state troopers.

389
00:32:16,634 --> 00:32:18,898
I figured you'd know
what really happened.

390
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:22,167
I was on the grader. Twombley,
summer people from Massachusetts.

391
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:25,676
Friend of Gordon's. It was Gordon's idea
for Jack to take him hunting.

392
00:32:25,743 --> 00:32:28,234
Oh, boy. I gotta go.

393
00:32:28,313 --> 00:32:32,545
I want you to work on
a new logo for that. I don't like that.

394
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:36,519
- All righty.
- Put an idea of a mountain down there.

395
00:32:36,587 --> 00:32:39,078
Something like that
with a stream below.

396
00:32:39,157 --> 00:32:42,024
- What's the hurry?
- Hunting accident. Jack and Twombley.

397
00:32:42,093 --> 00:32:45,756
- I figured you would've heard.
- Twombley! Jesus! Get moving.

398
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:48,958
I gotta get up there. How would I have
heard? Have somebody move the grader.

399
00:32:51,102 --> 00:32:56,631
Go on. Go on! You drive.
We'll take my truck.

400
00:33:00,912 --> 00:33:02,812
Turn it off.

401
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:05,781
All you heard was there was
some kind of accident?

402
00:33:05,850 --> 00:33:07,977
Twombley's shot. I heard that.

403
00:33:08,052 --> 00:33:10,077
Jack's okay, I assume.

404
00:33:10,154 --> 00:33:13,021
- You don't know how bad or anything?
- You mean Twombley?

405
00:33:13,091 --> 00:33:15,651
Yes, Wade.
I mean Twombley.

406
00:33:15,727 --> 00:33:17,991
Put out that cigarette!

407
00:33:18,062 --> 00:33:20,121
Fuck, fuck, fuck!

408
00:33:20,198 --> 00:33:23,065
Probably shot himself
in the foot or somethin'.

409
00:33:23,134 --> 00:33:25,068
That's what usually happens.

410
00:33:25,136 --> 00:33:28,367
- I should've sent you instead of Jack.
- I wish you had.

411
00:33:28,439 --> 00:33:32,068
I'd rather be deer huntin' than freezin'
my ass off on that fuckin' grader.

412
00:33:32,143 --> 00:33:35,772
Well, you ain't the hunter Jack is, and
he can't drive the grader worth shit.

413
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:38,247
Like hell!

414
00:33:40,084 --> 00:33:44,987
- That must've been Twombley.
- Want me to follow them to Littleton?

415
00:33:45,056 --> 00:33:49,322
No, no, let's go to the top.
Talk to Jack first.

416
00:33:49,394 --> 00:33:52,830
He'll know what happened.
He best fucking better know!

417
00:34:01,506 --> 00:34:03,531
There's Jack.

418
00:34:04,942 --> 00:34:06,967
I clocked 105.

419
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:09,775
105? That was pretty fast.

420
00:34:09,847 --> 00:34:14,784
Turns out to be
one of these kids up for the weekend.

421
00:34:14,852 --> 00:34:19,653
She says, "Officer, can we make this
disappear?" Shows me $100 bill.

422
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:22,625
Heard the news?

423
00:34:22,693 --> 00:34:24,888
- I heard Twombley got shot.
- Yeah.

424
00:34:24,962 --> 00:34:27,055
Watch the dog, Wade.

425
00:34:27,131 --> 00:34:30,066
- Takes a mind to,
he'll take your head off.
- He likes me.

426
00:34:30,134 --> 00:34:33,160
- Is it bad?
- 30-30 at close range.

427
00:34:33,237 --> 00:34:34,727
Jesus!

428
00:34:34,806 --> 00:34:38,435
- Will he make it?
- D.O.A. Blew the bastard wide open.

429
00:34:38,509 --> 00:34:40,534
Had a hole in his back
you could put your fist into.

430
00:34:40,611 --> 00:34:42,772
Nice hole in front too.

431
00:34:42,847 --> 00:34:46,248
- Did you see it?
- No. Heard it.

432
00:34:46,317 --> 00:34:49,809
We weren't far apart.
I'd spotted this buck.

433
00:34:49,887 --> 00:34:52,219
I looked at the bottom
of the cliff where he was standin',

434
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:54,918
and there the fucker was,
deader than shit!

435
00:34:54,992 --> 00:34:57,290
I called it right in.

436
00:34:57,361 --> 00:34:59,420
This is gonna be one mess
to clean up.

437
00:34:59,497 --> 00:35:02,022
Twombley's son-in-law and daughter
are up for the weekend.

438
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:05,433
- Didn't you say you'd seen him, Wade?
- Yeah. Damn near ran me over.

439
00:35:05,503 --> 00:35:07,664
You want to tell them?
You knew the old man.

440
00:35:07,738 --> 00:35:11,196
What the fuck!
My day's already ruined.

441
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:13,436
Gimme the keys.
You can go back with Jack.

442
00:35:13,511 --> 00:35:17,140
- You still got plowing to do.
- It ain't finished,
if that's what you mean.

443
00:35:17,215 --> 00:35:21,618
- Something bugging you?
- Yeah, a few things.

444
00:35:21,686 --> 00:35:23,813
Right now we're not interested
in a few things.

445
00:35:23,888 --> 00:35:27,847
Why don't you do a few things
for me, and then you get bugged
on your own time?

446
00:35:31,062 --> 00:35:34,657
You might as well take the rest
of the day off. You look fucked up.

447
00:35:34,732 --> 00:35:36,723
You've been paid
for the day anyhow, right?

448
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:39,395
Not exactly.
I mean, he never paid me.

449
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:42,837
Don't worry.
You'll get your money.

450
00:35:42,907 --> 00:35:45,273
Don't talk to any newspaper
about this.

451
00:35:45,343 --> 00:35:48,141
Twombley's
a big deal down in Massachusetts.

452
00:35:48,212 --> 00:35:50,578
Just tell them that your lawyer
says you shouldn't comment.

453
00:35:50,648 --> 00:35:52,809
Lawyer?
I don't need a lawyer, do I?

454
00:35:52,884 --> 00:35:55,580
No, of course not.
Just say it. That's all.

455
00:36:06,097 --> 00:36:08,759
- Where'd Twombley get shot?
- In the chest.

456
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:13,031
- No. I mean whereabouts.
- About a half mile in,
along the old lumber road.

457
00:36:13,104 --> 00:36:16,972
The old lumber road, huh? That's a
steep climb. You bring him up yourself?

458
00:36:17,041 --> 00:36:19,703
Ambulance guys lugged him up.

459
00:36:21,412 --> 00:36:24,176
- You stayed away?
- Yeah.

460
00:36:26,083 --> 00:36:28,813
- Where'd you get that blood?
- What blood?

461
00:36:28,886 --> 00:36:31,047
On your sleeve.

462
00:36:31,122 --> 00:36:34,853
Must've... Ahh.
How do I know?

463
00:36:34,926 --> 00:36:37,087
What are you doing, playing cop?

464
00:36:37,161 --> 00:36:40,995
I gotta make a report to Fish and Game.
I'm just wondering, that's all.

465
00:36:41,065 --> 00:36:45,399
- What'd he do?
- Who the fuck knows?

466
00:36:45,469 --> 00:36:48,267
Must've slipped or something.

467
00:36:48,339 --> 00:36:50,899
I just heard the gun go off.

468
00:36:51,976 --> 00:36:54,604
I've never seen a man get shot before.

469
00:36:54,679 --> 00:36:58,513
Not even in the service.
Must be somethin'.

470
00:37:00,151 --> 00:37:03,712
- I didn't actually see it. Like I said.
- Sure you did.

471
00:37:03,788 --> 00:37:06,313
- What?
- Saw him get shot.

472
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:09,985
What the fuck are you telling me?
I never seen the guy get shot.

473
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:12,996
You must've seen him get shot!
I know you did!

474
00:37:14,732 --> 00:37:18,668
Let's get the fuck outta here.
You're not making any sense.

475
00:37:21,205 --> 00:37:24,766
There's your old 20-gauge, and that's
that new Browning you were showing me.

476
00:37:24,842 --> 00:37:27,242
Oh, look at this.

477
00:37:27,311 --> 00:37:29,779
That must be Twombley's gun.

478
00:37:29,847 --> 00:37:32,611
It's brand-new.
Very fancy tooling, huh?

479
00:37:32,683 --> 00:37:34,776
Probably only been fired one time.

480
00:37:34,852 --> 00:37:40,222
But what the hell, Jack? I guess you
deserve it. Right's right, huh?

481
00:37:40,291 --> 00:37:43,192
Twombley sure as hell
won't be shooting it again.

482
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:47,391
- I gotta turn it in to Fish and Game.
- Yeah, I was goin' to.

483
00:37:47,465 --> 00:37:49,524
Sure, you were.

484
00:37:57,541 --> 00:37:59,475
- Rolfe?
- Yeah, Wade?

485
00:37:59,543 --> 00:38:02,341
Brother, look.
I was calling 'cause...

486
00:38:02,413 --> 00:38:05,678
Has there been anything on TV in Boston
about a hunting accident...

487
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:09,584
involving a guy named Twombley,
Evan Twombley?

488
00:38:09,654 --> 00:38:12,020
There was something.
It happened up your way.

489
00:38:12,089 --> 00:38:17,891
Yeah. Yeah, I know him.
I mean, the kid that was with him.

490
00:38:17,962 --> 00:38:19,896
Maybe you did too.
Jack Hewitt.

491
00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:24,094
He works for LaRiviere with me.
He's my best friend.

492
00:38:24,168 --> 00:38:26,796
Wade, it's late.
I know you're probably at Toby's.

493
00:38:26,871 --> 00:38:29,169
But I'm in bed reading.
We have different habits.

494
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:33,904
No, no. Not tonight.
I'm in bed too.

495
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:38,210
I was calling 'cause
I need you to listen. I got this theory.

496
00:38:40,918 --> 00:38:43,853
Jack says he didn't see Twombley shot.

497
00:38:47,725 --> 00:38:52,458
It'll come out that Jack lied,
and the kid'll hang for it.

498
00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:55,124
He was scheduled to testify
for a committee...

499
00:38:55,199 --> 00:38:58,828
investigating organized crime in
New England, the construction business.

500
00:38:58,903 --> 00:39:01,838
- Who?
- Twombley.

501
00:39:01,906 --> 00:39:04,670
- No shit!
- Why? Do you think Jack shot him?

502
00:39:04,742 --> 00:39:10,476
- Well, it was an accident.
- They were out deer hunting, right?

503
00:39:13,384 --> 00:39:16,012
Maybe there was a third person.

504
00:39:16,087 --> 00:39:18,783
Hmm.

505
00:39:18,856 --> 00:39:21,950
Lillian was here. In Lawford.

506
00:39:23,294 --> 00:39:26,320
- Night before the shooting.
- How was she?

507
00:39:26,397 --> 00:39:29,855
She came to pick up Jill.

508
00:39:29,934 --> 00:39:35,736
She was supposed to spend
the weekend for Halloween,
but she wanted to go home.

509
00:39:35,806 --> 00:39:38,331
- Who?
- Jill.

510
00:39:40,411 --> 00:39:45,747
I was thinking of getting a lawyer.
Maybe you can help me.

511
00:39:45,816 --> 00:39:49,616
- What happened?
- A divorce lawyer.

512
00:39:49,687 --> 00:39:53,350
No, a custody lawyer.
You know, 'cause of Jill.

513
00:39:53,424 --> 00:39:56,518
Don't think about it.
You're exhausted.

514
00:39:56,594 --> 00:39:58,994
Yeah, I guess so.

515
00:39:59,063 --> 00:40:01,156
Get some sleep.

516
00:40:03,334 --> 00:40:08,397
I get to feeling like
a whipped dog some days.

517
00:40:08,472 --> 00:40:12,067
Some night I'm gonna bite back.
I swear it.

518
00:40:12,143 --> 00:40:14,805
Haven't you already done
a bit of that?

519
00:40:14,879 --> 00:40:18,144
No, no, I haven't.
Not really.

520
00:40:18,215 --> 00:40:21,810
I've growled a little,

521
00:40:21,886 --> 00:40:24,047
but I haven't bit.

522
00:40:47,144 --> 00:40:49,544
It's okay, sweetie.

523
00:40:51,649 --> 00:40:53,810
Who are you?

524
00:40:53,884 --> 00:40:58,014
I'm Wade Whitehouse.
Is your husband here?

525
00:40:58,088 --> 00:41:01,251
He's asleep.

526
00:41:01,325 --> 00:41:04,817
We were up very late last night.

527
00:41:04,895 --> 00:41:09,229
I just wanted to say I'm really sorry
about your father, Mrs. Twombley.

528
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:12,133
Mrs. Gordon. Thank you.

529
00:41:12,203 --> 00:41:15,866
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

530
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:19,376
I just had a little business
to do with Mr. Gordon.

531
00:41:19,443 --> 00:41:23,971
- I'm the local police officer.
- Something about my father?

532
00:41:24,048 --> 00:41:27,540
No, no, no. It's just a traffic thing.
It's no big deal.

533
00:41:30,621 --> 00:41:32,680
Can it wait then?

534
00:41:33,858 --> 00:41:36,622
Whitehouse, next time,
phone ahead.

535
00:41:36,694 --> 00:41:40,255
Jesus Christ, Mr. Gordon.

536
00:41:40,331 --> 00:41:45,394
When I come all the way out here
to serve somebody a summons,
I don't call ahead.

537
00:41:47,471 --> 00:41:49,735
What the hell
are you talking about?

538
00:41:49,807 --> 00:41:52,970
I'm issuing you a ticket.
A moving violation.

539
00:41:53,043 --> 00:41:55,068
Moving violation?

540
00:41:55,145 --> 00:41:58,171
I just get out of bed,
and you're talking about
a goddamn speeding ticket?

541
00:41:58,249 --> 00:42:03,016
- Yesterday you passed a stopped
school bus which had a flashing...
- Hold on.

542
00:42:03,087 --> 00:42:05,988
Don't ever put your hands on me,
Mr. Gordon.

543
00:42:06,056 --> 00:42:09,184
You're talkin' about a goddamned ticket
from the time I passed you...

544
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:12,559
while you were dreaming of
becoming a traffic cop or something.

545
00:42:14,665 --> 00:42:16,895
There's your ticket.

546
00:42:18,502 --> 00:42:21,062
You get the hell outta
my house now, asshole.

547
00:42:21,138 --> 00:42:24,107
You'll be a lucky asshole if I haven't
got you fired by the end of the day.

548
00:42:24,174 --> 00:42:28,543
I could do that. Just one phone call.
I'm pissed enough to do it.

549
00:42:34,485 --> 00:42:37,921
Jack's kind of sensitive, I guess.

550
00:42:37,988 --> 00:42:41,685
Heard he was drunk at Toby's last night
and got in a fight with Hettie.

551
00:42:41,759 --> 00:42:43,886
He drove off without her.

552
00:42:43,961 --> 00:42:49,228
I'm sure. I'm positive it didn't
happen the way Jack says it did.

553
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:54,328
Jack's turned into one of those men
who are permanently angry.

554
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:57,101
He used to be a sweet kid.

555
00:42:57,174 --> 00:43:02,635
When he found out he couldn't
play ball anymore, he changed.

556
00:43:02,713 --> 00:43:05,181
Now he's like everyone else.

557
00:43:05,249 --> 00:43:09,413
I've been wondering
if maybe Jack shot Twombley,

558
00:43:09,486 --> 00:43:13,513
instead of Twombley
shooting himself.

559
00:43:13,591 --> 00:43:16,958
I wonder if maybe
Jack shot him on purpose.

560
00:43:21,832 --> 00:43:25,893
Wade! How can you even
think such a thing?

561
00:43:25,970 --> 00:43:28,996
Why would Jack Hewitt do that?
Shoot Twombley on purpose?

562
00:43:29,073 --> 00:43:31,007
Money.

563
00:43:31,075 --> 00:43:34,374
- Jack doesn't need money.
- Everybody needs money.

564
00:43:34,445 --> 00:43:39,109
Except Twombley and that son of a bitch
son-in-law of his. People like that.

565
00:43:39,183 --> 00:43:43,745
- Jack wouldn't kill for it.
Besides, who'd pay him?
- Lots of people.

566
00:43:43,821 --> 00:43:48,155
A guy like Twombley probably got
lots of people who want to see him dead.

567
00:43:48,225 --> 00:43:50,819
The government's investigating
his links to the Mafia.

568
00:43:50,894 --> 00:43:54,489
Oh, the Mafia hired Jack Hewitt?

569
00:43:54,565 --> 00:43:57,398
No, no.

570
00:43:57,468 --> 00:44:01,564
I just know Jack's lying
about how it happened.

571
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:05,473
He seemed... tight, you know?

572
00:44:05,542 --> 00:44:10,309
I know that kid. I know what he's like
inside. He's like me when I was his age.

573
00:44:10,381 --> 00:44:15,182
You wouldn't have done anything
like that, shoot somebody for money.

574
00:44:15,252 --> 00:44:17,743
Not for money.

575
00:44:17,821 --> 00:44:22,849
But if somebody'd give me half a damned
excuse... I was pretty fucked up.

576
00:44:22,926 --> 00:44:25,690
But you're not anymore.

577
00:44:28,699 --> 00:44:30,860
When are you gonna get
that tooth fixed?

578
00:44:38,776 --> 00:44:43,873
- Oh, yeah, I can see
what you looked like as a kid.
- You knew me when I was a kid.

579
00:44:43,947 --> 00:44:49,351
No, not really. Not what you
looked like. I never studied your face.

580
00:44:49,420 --> 00:44:51,513
Hmm. I never really...

581
00:44:51,588 --> 00:44:55,080
could see you as a kid when
you were a kid until now, this way.

582
00:44:55,159 --> 00:44:57,093
In what way?

583
00:44:57,161 --> 00:44:59,425
After making love.

584
00:44:59,496 --> 00:45:04,456
I like it. It's nice to see that
in a grown-up person.

585
00:45:04,535 --> 00:45:06,765
It's kind of scary.

586
00:45:06,837 --> 00:45:09,397
- But it's nice.
- Yeah.

587
00:45:09,473 --> 00:45:12,203
- I'll get us a beer.
- Okay.

588
00:45:14,011 --> 00:45:17,071
Don't you think...

589
00:45:17,147 --> 00:45:20,275
Do you really think
it's a good idea to press...

590
00:45:20,350 --> 00:45:23,410
this custody thing right now?

591
00:45:23,487 --> 00:45:25,819
Sure. Why not?

592
00:45:27,357 --> 00:45:30,793
I don't know.
It's just... Seems like...

593
00:45:34,431 --> 00:45:37,867
I'm her father.
Supposed to be, but I'm not able to.

594
00:45:39,103 --> 00:45:42,004
Yeah. Yes, I do.

595
00:45:42,072 --> 00:45:46,270
You know, maybe the only thing
in my life...

596
00:45:46,343 --> 00:45:49,710
that I've been
so sure about wanting.

597
00:45:49,780 --> 00:45:53,409
Even if it takes a big fight.

598
00:45:53,484 --> 00:45:56,510
Well, then I guess you have to.

599
00:45:56,587 --> 00:45:59,522
There's another thing
I've been thinking about.

600
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:04,391
I don't know how you feel
about the idea, 'cause
we've never talked about it.

601
00:46:04,461 --> 00:46:07,157
But I've been thinking...

602
00:46:07,231 --> 00:46:11,895
I've been thinking we should
get married sometime. You and me.

603
00:46:11,969 --> 00:46:17,601
- Oh, Wade.
- It's just... It's just
a thought, that's all.

604
00:46:17,674 --> 00:46:21,405
- You've been married twice.
- Yeah, but it was to the same woman.

605
00:46:21,478 --> 00:46:23,844
I was just a kid.

606
00:46:23,914 --> 00:46:28,044
It's not like
a marriage proposal or anything.

607
00:46:28,118 --> 00:46:30,780
It's just a thought, an idea.

608
00:46:30,854 --> 00:46:34,722
Something for you and me
to think about, you know.

609
00:46:36,527 --> 00:46:40,429
- All right. I'll think about it.
- Good.

610
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:48,102
I've got sons, goddamn it!

611
00:46:48,172 --> 00:46:52,438
My God, have I got sons!

612
00:46:52,509 --> 00:46:56,536
Wade? Rolfe?

613
00:46:56,613 --> 00:46:59,013
Elbourne?

614
00:46:59,082 --> 00:47:01,448
You love me, boys?

615
00:47:01,518 --> 00:47:04,419
You love your Pop?

616
00:47:06,390 --> 00:47:09,325
Of course you do.

617
00:47:09,393 --> 00:47:13,454
Glen, come on, please.

618
00:47:13,530 --> 00:47:16,761
Oh, Christ, Sally!

619
00:47:16,834 --> 00:47:20,429
You are such a good person.

620
00:47:20,504 --> 00:47:22,438
Capital "G."

621
00:47:22,506 --> 00:47:27,466
By God, you are...
You are so much better than I am.

622
00:47:27,544 --> 00:47:30,980
I who am no goddamn good at all.

623
00:47:33,650 --> 00:47:35,584
And you,

624
00:47:35,652 --> 00:47:38,746
you are a truly good person...

625
00:47:38,822 --> 00:47:41,723
like a fucking saint!

626
00:47:41,792 --> 00:47:44,317
Fucking beyond compare!

627
00:47:44,394 --> 00:47:47,227
- Glen, don't. Come on.
- Get away!

628
00:47:49,399 --> 00:47:52,994
Whoa! My, my,
look at my big boy here,

629
00:47:53,070 --> 00:47:55,470
bursting out of the seams
of his jeans.

630
00:47:55,539 --> 00:47:59,976
- You little prick!
- Glen, don't!

631
00:48:07,451 --> 00:48:10,682
Yeah, well...

632
00:48:10,754 --> 00:48:14,155
Did you tell them that we were coming?

633
00:48:14,224 --> 00:48:17,625
Don't you think it's proper for a fella
to introduce his girl to his parents?

634
00:48:17,694 --> 00:48:19,662
I know your parents.

635
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:24,258
I just gotta pick up my divorce papers
for the lawyer. It won't take long.

636
00:48:24,334 --> 00:48:27,064
You're really gonna do that?
That custody thing?

637
00:48:27,137 --> 00:48:30,038
- Yeah!
- Oh, God.

638
00:48:30,107 --> 00:48:34,669
I think you'll be sorry. I think you'll
wish you'd never opened this up again.

639
00:48:34,745 --> 00:48:38,237
Maybe. But I'd be a hell
of a lot sorrier if I just let it go.

640
00:48:38,315 --> 00:48:40,442
Kids grow up fast
and then it's over.

641
00:48:40,517 --> 00:48:45,079
You get old, your kids are strangers.
Look at me and my old man.

642
00:48:45,155 --> 00:48:48,682
Your father's not like you.
That's why you and he are strangers.

643
00:48:49,927 --> 00:48:52,259
That's my whole point.

644
00:48:52,329 --> 00:48:54,024
I don't want to get into that.

645
00:48:54,097 --> 00:48:57,328
And Lillian's not like your mother.
She won't roll over.

646
00:48:57,401 --> 00:48:59,926
She'll fight you like a she-bear.

647
00:49:00,003 --> 00:49:04,872
If Lillian had been like my mother,
I wouldn't have to be doing any of this.

648
00:49:37,074 --> 00:49:37,938
Are you sure they're home?

649
00:49:38,008 --> 00:49:40,875
Well, the truck's still here.

650
00:49:40,944 --> 00:49:44,345
Looks like they stayed inside
since the snowfall.

651
00:49:48,652 --> 00:49:51,086
That's strange.

652
00:49:51,154 --> 00:49:53,315
You think they're all right?

653
00:49:53,390 --> 00:49:55,620
Yeah, of course.
I would've heard.

654
00:49:55,692 --> 00:49:58,627
- How?
- I don't know, for chrissake!

655
00:50:08,071 --> 00:50:10,835
Pop?

656
00:50:10,907 --> 00:50:13,375
Hey, Pop, you okay?

657
00:50:13,443 --> 00:50:15,377
Huh?

658
00:50:17,381 --> 00:50:19,315
Oh.

659
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:41,560
Jesus, Pop, how can you stand the cold,
dressed like that?

660
00:50:41,638 --> 00:50:43,606
Huh? Oh.

661
00:50:44,808 --> 00:50:47,072
Where's Ma?

662
00:50:47,144 --> 00:50:50,636
Ah, she's sleeping.

663
00:50:52,215 --> 00:50:54,149
Oh.

664
00:50:55,685 --> 00:50:58,313
You remember Margie Fogg?

665
00:50:59,856 --> 00:51:02,188
Oh. From Wickham's?

666
00:51:02,259 --> 00:51:03,954
Hello, Mr. Whitehouse.

667
00:51:04,027 --> 00:51:07,986
Ah. You, ah, like
some coffee or something?

668
00:51:08,065 --> 00:51:11,057
No, thanks.

669
00:51:11,134 --> 00:51:13,364
How are you and Ma doing?
I haven't seen you in town.

670
00:51:13,437 --> 00:51:17,237
We're all right.
Yeah, we're all right.

671
00:51:17,307 --> 00:51:21,107
Uh, she's sleeping.
You want me to go up and get her?

672
00:51:21,178 --> 00:51:23,442
- Yeah.
- Oh.

673
00:51:29,152 --> 00:51:31,450
Jesus. Nothing's
changed around here.

674
00:51:31,521 --> 00:51:34,979
- It's freezing in here.
- Yeah, yeah. I'll put some wood on.

675
00:51:35,058 --> 00:51:37,322
Close the door would help.

676
00:51:38,495 --> 00:51:40,690
Don't. It's bad for you.

677
00:51:47,337 --> 00:51:51,296
- Maybe they're too old
to be staying here.
- Maybe so.

678
00:51:55,112 --> 00:51:57,342
Where's Mom?

679
00:51:57,414 --> 00:51:59,848
Ah, she's comin'.

680
00:51:59,916 --> 00:52:03,647
Have you been heating
the house? Not just with the stove.

681
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:06,245
Well, there's a furnace here.

682
00:52:06,323 --> 00:52:10,953
- You're not using it today?
- Well, I...

683
00:52:11,027 --> 00:52:13,086
It's broken or something.

684
00:52:13,163 --> 00:52:17,259
There's an electric
up in the bedroom.

685
00:52:17,334 --> 00:52:21,634
Maybe Wade oughta take a look at it.
Your pipes will freeze.

686
00:52:21,705 --> 00:52:24,538
- Would you do that, Wade?
- Yeah, yeah.

687
00:52:33,016 --> 00:52:34,950
Ah...

688
00:52:46,196 --> 00:52:48,289
Ma?

689
00:52:54,237 --> 00:52:56,330
Ma?

690
00:53:03,580 --> 00:53:07,311
Hey, Ma.

691
00:53:07,384 --> 00:53:11,343
Ma, come on, wake up.

692
00:53:15,659 --> 00:53:18,856
Oh, Jesus.

693
00:53:18,929 --> 00:53:21,796
Oh, Lord.

694
00:53:21,865 --> 00:53:23,833
Oh, Jesus.

695
00:53:32,475 --> 00:53:34,966
Wade?

696
00:53:46,189 --> 00:53:48,123
Is, uh...

697
00:53:52,329 --> 00:53:54,559
She's dead then?

698
00:53:54,631 --> 00:53:56,064
Yep.

699
00:53:56,132 --> 00:53:58,566
When did she die?

700
00:54:00,403 --> 00:54:02,894
I checked on her.

701
00:54:02,973 --> 00:54:06,272
I brought the electric up.

702
00:54:06,343 --> 00:54:10,040
The cold bothers her
more than it does me.

703
00:54:10,113 --> 00:54:13,674
That's why I brought
the electric up and...

704
00:54:13,750 --> 00:54:17,447
- Don't you have a telephone?
- It's in the living room.

705
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:20,921
Why didn't you call
and have the furnace fixed?

706
00:54:20,991 --> 00:54:25,394
Oh, Wade.
I thought she was all right.

707
00:54:27,197 --> 00:54:32,362
Till this morning, she was.

708
00:54:32,435 --> 00:54:34,460
It makes me sad!

709
00:54:34,537 --> 00:54:36,937
Is there anything I can do?

710
00:54:37,007 --> 00:54:39,771
Makes me sad it was her
instead of me.

711
00:54:39,843 --> 00:54:42,334
God!

712
00:54:42,412 --> 00:54:44,903
Oh.

713
00:54:50,820 --> 00:54:53,254
I should've froze.

714
00:55:07,537 --> 00:55:10,335
Wade called me, as usual, late at night.

715
00:55:10,407 --> 00:55:14,503
I knew it was Wade.
No one else calls me at that hour.

716
00:55:14,577 --> 00:55:19,514
And I was ready to listen to another
chapter in one of his ongoing sagas.

717
00:55:19,582 --> 00:55:22,915
There was the detective story concerning
the shooting of Evan Twombley,

718
00:55:22,986 --> 00:55:27,650
and the family melodrama
about Wade's custody fight with Lillian.

719
00:55:27,724 --> 00:55:29,715
But not this time.

720
00:55:29,793 --> 00:55:33,320
Wade was telling
a different story, or so it seemed then,

721
00:55:33,396 --> 00:55:35,990
one in which I myself was a character.

722
00:55:36,066 --> 00:55:38,899
He had called to tell me
that some time the previous night...

723
00:55:38,968 --> 00:55:41,664
he had discovered
our mother had died,

724
00:55:41,738 --> 00:55:46,835
and he'd discovered the body
when he went over to visit her
and our father with Margie Fogg.

725
00:55:46,910 --> 00:55:51,176
It was left to me to tell
our sister Lena and her husband Clyde...

726
00:55:51,247 --> 00:55:55,149
who'd gone overweight and
made Jesus Christ their personal Savior.

727
00:55:58,922 --> 00:56:01,720
Pop was okay, but out of it.

728
00:56:01,791 --> 00:56:06,194
Worse than usual, maybe,
though no drunker than usual.

729
00:56:12,369 --> 00:56:15,497
How 'bout you, Rolfe? Are you saved?

730
00:56:15,572 --> 00:56:19,099
No, I'm not.

731
00:56:19,175 --> 00:56:21,439
But then you'll be in hell.

732
00:56:21,511 --> 00:56:23,877
I guess I will.

733
00:56:23,947 --> 00:56:27,439
Me and Mom and Wade and Pop.

734
00:56:27,517 --> 00:56:29,451
We'll all be there together.

735
00:56:29,519 --> 00:56:31,544
Shouldn't we get this show on the road?

736
00:56:33,957 --> 00:56:37,893
Well, pointless to stand around
in church, I guess, with nothing to do.

737
00:56:37,961 --> 00:56:41,453
What about Jill?
Is Lillian bringing her?

738
00:56:41,531 --> 00:56:44,022
They'll be at the church
and the cemetery.

739
00:56:44,100 --> 00:56:47,900
Anyone else want another beer?
Rolfe?

740
00:56:47,971 --> 00:56:50,166
No, thanks.
I don't drink.

741
00:56:52,041 --> 00:56:54,839
Yeah, I forgot. Sorry.

742
00:56:57,247 --> 00:56:59,977
How are you holding up, Wade?

743
00:57:00,049 --> 00:57:02,916
Oh, I'm fine.

744
00:57:02,986 --> 00:57:05,511
- Are you Rolfe?
- Yes.

745
00:57:05,588 --> 00:57:09,581
Gordon. Gordon LaRiviere.
I remember you from high school.

746
00:57:09,659 --> 00:57:11,889
You're a teacher now? Hmm?

747
00:57:11,961 --> 00:57:14,555
- Harvard?
- B.U.

748
00:57:14,631 --> 00:57:17,225
Oh. I don't see you around.

749
00:57:17,300 --> 00:57:20,565
I don't suppose there's much reason
for you to come this way.

750
00:57:22,772 --> 00:57:26,105
- Come on, Pop.
- Hmm?

751
00:57:27,444 --> 00:57:30,709
- Join us.
- Huh?

752
00:57:30,780 --> 00:57:32,839
Reverend?

753
00:57:32,916 --> 00:57:36,079
Let's kneel for a moment of prayer
before the service.

754
00:57:36,152 --> 00:57:39,349
Wade? Rolfe?

755
00:57:41,791 --> 00:57:45,249
- This is nuts.
- Wade.

756
00:57:49,566 --> 00:57:51,500
- Jesus in heaven,
- Oh!

757
00:57:51,568 --> 00:57:55,436
We come to Thee on our knees,
begging for Thy forgiveness.

758
00:57:55,505 --> 00:57:59,669
And thanking Thee for
the undeserved gift of Thy salvation.

759
00:57:59,742 --> 00:58:03,838
We thank Thee, whose blood
was shed that we may live.

760
00:58:03,913 --> 00:58:05,904
- Praise the Lord!
- Praise the Lord.

761
00:58:05,982 --> 00:58:11,284
Oh, God, not one of you
is worth a single hair
on that woman's head! God!

762
00:58:11,354 --> 00:58:15,188
Please look down upon this woman,
our mother and friend,

763
00:58:15,258 --> 00:58:17,556
and make her example
known to us.

764
00:58:17,627 --> 00:58:22,564
Not one of you is worth a goddamned hair
on that good woman's head!

765
00:58:22,632 --> 00:58:25,692
- Pop!
- Jesus! What is this shit?

766
00:58:25,768 --> 00:58:29,329
- I'll head on to the church.
- This is a difficult time.

767
00:58:29,405 --> 00:58:34,866
- Pop, it's no big deal.
- Oh, smart guy.
Tell me it's no big deal?

768
00:58:34,944 --> 00:58:37,811
I just... Tell me...

769
00:58:37,881 --> 00:58:42,716
there's a single one of you
that's worth one single hair
on that woman's gray head!

770
00:58:42,785 --> 00:58:44,753
- Pop?
- What?

771
00:58:44,821 --> 00:58:47,051
Jesus is more powerful
than any demon.

772
00:58:47,123 --> 00:58:51,822
- Oh, go fuck yourself!
- Wade, just leave it.

773
00:58:51,895 --> 00:58:55,991
Yeah, just listen
to your little brother here.

774
00:58:56,065 --> 00:58:59,592
"Wade, just leave it."

775
00:58:59,669 --> 00:59:02,968
Candy-asses.

776
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:05,599
All of you.

777
00:59:05,675 --> 00:59:09,236
That's what I've got for children.

778
00:59:09,312 --> 00:59:12,645
Jesus freaks and candy-asses!

779
00:59:12,715 --> 00:59:16,845
Oh. "Just leave it, Wade.

780
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:20,913
Praise the Lord!
Just leave it, Wade."

781
00:59:20,990 --> 00:59:23,823
- Stop, Glen Whitehouse!
- Goddamn it! Come on, girl!

782
00:59:26,262 --> 00:59:31,529
If you ever touch her again,
I'll kill you! I swear it!

783
00:59:33,736 --> 00:59:37,695
You're still standing up
for your little brother, huh?

784
00:59:41,611 --> 00:59:45,342
For as much as it hath pleased
Almighty God of His great mercy...

785
00:59:46,816 --> 00:59:49,080
It snowed the day of the funeral.

786
00:59:49,152 --> 00:59:52,087
The snow line had descended
from Canada weeks before...

787
00:59:52,155 --> 00:59:54,385
and was now well south of Lawford,

788
00:59:54,457 --> 00:59:58,917
creeping across New Hampshire
towards Massachusetts.

789
00:59:58,995 --> 01:00:02,761
In sure and certain hope
of the Resurrection to enteral life,

790
01:00:02,832 --> 01:00:05,266
through our Lord Jesus Christ.

791
01:00:07,670 --> 01:00:10,434
Earth to earth, ashes to ashes,

792
01:00:10,506 --> 01:00:12,440
dust to dust.

793
01:00:12,508 --> 01:00:14,442
Amen.

794
01:00:16,980 --> 01:00:20,313
Pop, let's go back to the house.

795
01:00:27,323 --> 01:00:29,848
- Hey, Dad.
- Hey.

796
01:00:38,668 --> 01:00:40,568
I'm glad you came.

797
01:00:40,637 --> 01:00:42,969
Can you stay for a while?

798
01:00:43,039 --> 01:00:44,973
No.

799
01:00:53,182 --> 01:00:57,141
You ever go to
your father's grave anymore?

800
01:00:57,220 --> 01:00:59,586
No, not anymore.

801
01:00:59,656 --> 01:01:01,954
It's too far.

802
01:01:06,062 --> 01:01:07,996
We should talk.

803
01:01:08,064 --> 01:01:10,862
- We've done all our talking, Wade.
- It's just that...

804
01:01:10,933 --> 01:01:13,299
No, please don't.

805
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:19,808
I'm sorry about your mother.

806
01:01:20,877 --> 01:01:22,868
I really liked her.

807
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:27,847
You never know how much
women like that suffer.

808
01:01:27,917 --> 01:01:33,287
Like they live their whole lives
with the sound turned off.

809
01:01:33,356 --> 01:01:35,290
Then they're gone.

810
01:01:41,931 --> 01:01:44,627
- Mom?
- Huh?

811
01:01:44,701 --> 01:01:48,762
- She's got an ice skating
lesson at 4:00.
- I'm taking ice skating, Dad.

812
01:01:48,838 --> 01:01:51,534
That's great.

813
01:01:51,607 --> 01:01:55,099
- Figure skating, I suppose.
- And ice ballet.

814
01:01:55,178 --> 01:01:57,112
That's great.

815
01:02:04,287 --> 01:02:06,221
Well...

816
01:02:07,423 --> 01:02:09,618
Good-bye, Dad.

817
01:02:34,751 --> 01:02:37,948
- What about Margie?
- What about her?

818
01:02:38,020 --> 01:02:40,682
You still plan on
getting married?

819
01:02:40,757 --> 01:02:45,353
Oh, yeah. She'll probably quit her job
and move out here with Pop.

820
01:02:45,428 --> 01:02:47,396
We can't leave him alone anymore.

821
01:02:47,463 --> 01:02:50,364
He'll probably set
the damn place on fire.

822
01:02:50,433 --> 01:02:54,164
And with Jill here a lot,
it'll be good to have Margie around.

823
01:02:56,239 --> 01:02:59,640
Things are gonna change
in that department, by the way.

824
01:02:59,709 --> 01:03:02,803
I got a custody lawyer down in Concord.
I'm gonna see him tomorrow.

825
01:03:02,879 --> 01:03:07,339
All hell's gonna break loose, but it'll
be worth it. Here, put the shovels away.

826
01:03:15,324 --> 01:03:19,317
I wanna let it run out of gas.

827
01:03:19,395 --> 01:03:21,829
I don't want the bastard drivin' drunk.

828
01:03:21,898 --> 01:03:24,264
He's drunk all the time now.

829
01:03:24,333 --> 01:03:27,302
After, we'll hide the keys.

830
01:03:27,370 --> 01:03:29,770
Anything new about
the shooting? Twombley?

831
01:03:29,839 --> 01:03:33,400
No. I guess it was an accident
like everybody thinks.

832
01:03:33,476 --> 01:03:36,036
Want to know what
I think happened?

833
01:03:36,112 --> 01:03:38,774
You find them everywhere.

834
01:03:38,848 --> 01:03:42,284
I think your first response
to the shooting was the correct one.

835
01:03:52,695 --> 01:03:57,132
- Which is?
- That it wasn't an accident.

836
01:03:57,200 --> 01:03:59,168
Well, then who shot him?

837
01:03:59,235 --> 01:04:01,829
Your friend, I think. Jack Hewitt.

838
01:04:01,904 --> 01:04:03,838
Jack.

839
01:04:03,906 --> 01:04:06,466
Come on, Rolfe.
Give me a motive.

840
01:04:06,542 --> 01:04:09,306
- Money.
- Money? Who'd pay 'im
that kind of money?

841
01:04:09,378 --> 01:04:12,711
Not the mob.
They got their own guys. Specialists.

842
01:04:12,782 --> 01:04:17,412
Who else benefits
if Twombley is suddenly dead?

843
01:04:20,289 --> 01:04:23,486
- I don't know. You tell me.
- Okay.

844
01:04:23,559 --> 01:04:28,758
It's likely there are people
in the union who don't want
Twombley to testify.

845
01:04:28,831 --> 01:04:31,891
That probably includes his son-in-law,
who's vice president,

846
01:04:31,968 --> 01:04:34,493
and will probably be
the next president.

847
01:04:34,570 --> 01:04:37,733
- I read that in the papers.
Uh, what's his name?
- Mel Gordon.

848
01:04:37,807 --> 01:04:40,503
- Mel Gordon, right.
- The guy in the B.M.W., right?

849
01:04:40,576 --> 01:04:43,101
Okay, here's my theory.

850
01:04:43,179 --> 01:04:46,376
Twombley, he doesn't know
about illegal loans or whatever,

851
01:04:46,449 --> 01:04:50,943
and he starts to nose around because
of the investigation, and he finds out.

852
01:04:51,020 --> 01:04:54,285
Finds out his son-in-law is involved.

853
01:04:54,357 --> 01:04:57,918
So Mel Gordon wouldn't want
a professional hit.

854
01:04:57,994 --> 01:05:01,725
That makes the Feds dig deeper.
He wants it to look like an accident.

855
01:05:01,797 --> 01:05:04,322
A hunting accident's perfect.

856
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:07,198
Around here,
you shoot somebody in the woods,

857
01:05:07,270 --> 01:05:12,003
you say it was an accident,
they fine you 50 bucks and
they lift your hunting license.

858
01:05:12,074 --> 01:05:14,042
And Jack, he...

859
01:05:16,312 --> 01:05:19,679
Jack's probably sayin' the guy shot
himself 'cause he ain't got his deer,

860
01:05:19,749 --> 01:05:23,708
and he don't want
his license lifted.

861
01:05:23,786 --> 01:05:27,620
Nah. That's too neat.
Things ain't that neat.

862
01:05:27,690 --> 01:05:32,127
- Some things are.
- Only in books.

863
01:05:32,194 --> 01:05:34,128
It's what happened.

864
01:05:39,001 --> 01:05:40,992
That makes me mad.

865
01:05:42,471 --> 01:05:45,463
That somebody can shoot somebody,
his own father-in-law,

866
01:05:45,541 --> 01:05:47,475
and not be punished for it.

867
01:05:47,543 --> 01:05:50,171
- Don't that piss you off?
- No, not particularly.

868
01:05:50,246 --> 01:05:53,613
Right's right, goddamn it. Jesus, Rolfe.
Don't you care about what's right?

869
01:05:53,683 --> 01:05:56,151
I care about what happened.

870
01:05:56,218 --> 01:05:59,016
The truth.

871
01:05:59,088 --> 01:06:04,321
Remember, I'm a student
of history. Books.

872
01:06:14,370 --> 01:06:17,305
I've been thinkin' about
that story you told me...

873
01:06:17,373 --> 01:06:19,341
about Pop...

874
01:06:19,408 --> 01:06:23,401
and chopping the firewood
out of the ice and after.

875
01:06:27,583 --> 01:06:32,020
I don't want to disappoint you,
but I don't think it happened.

876
01:06:32,088 --> 01:06:35,421
- You don't think I'd remember
a thing like that?
- It wasn't me.

877
01:06:35,491 --> 01:06:39,552
I wasn't there.
When I heard about it, it was Elbourne.

878
01:06:39,628 --> 01:06:42,688
Elbourne, Jesus. We'd have
to go digging in Vietnam to ask him.

879
01:06:42,765 --> 01:06:46,360
And Elbourne and Mom
brought you to the doctor...

880
01:06:46,435 --> 01:06:50,098
and told him
you fell from the hayloft.

881
01:06:50,172 --> 01:06:53,437
I never heard that one.

882
01:06:55,044 --> 01:06:58,445
No, I remember clearly because...

883
01:06:58,514 --> 01:07:04,419
after I heard, I became
real careful around Pop.

884
01:07:04,487 --> 01:07:07,456
I was a careful child...

885
01:07:07,523 --> 01:07:10,754
and I became a careful adult.

886
01:07:10,826 --> 01:07:14,762
But at least I was never afflicted
by that man's violence.

887
01:07:21,971 --> 01:07:24,769
That's what you think.

888
01:07:30,980 --> 01:07:33,312
Ahh!

889
01:07:33,382 --> 01:07:36,545
I better head back.
It's a long drive.

890
01:07:36,619 --> 01:07:38,553
All right.

891
01:07:38,621 --> 01:07:40,555
Okay.

892
01:07:46,295 --> 01:07:48,422
Ready, Jimmy?

893
01:07:48,497 --> 01:07:50,465
Put out that cigarette!

894
01:07:52,468 --> 01:07:55,266
Not there, asshole. Strip it.

895
01:07:56,806 --> 01:07:58,899
- Morning, Gordon.
- Morning, Wade.

896
01:07:58,974 --> 01:08:01,067
Hey, Jack.

897
01:08:01,143 --> 01:08:03,805
- I'm fuckin' out of here.
- What, Lawford?

898
01:08:03,879 --> 01:08:06,109
Out of this fucking job.
This job sucks.

899
01:08:06,182 --> 01:08:08,673
Workin' outside
in the winter sucks.

900
01:08:08,751 --> 01:08:12,482
- Open the door, will you?
- Why don't you quit now,
you want out so bad?

901
01:08:12,555 --> 01:08:15,752
- Open the door. We're late.
- No, I mean it, Jack.

902
01:08:15,825 --> 01:08:19,727
You got enough money now.
Head out to California. Surf's up, Jack.

903
01:08:19,795 --> 01:08:24,289
- And you digging wells in the snow.
- What do you mean I got money?

904
01:08:24,366 --> 01:08:29,303
- I'm as broke as you.
- Looney Tunes, Jack.
Fucking Looney Tunes.

905
01:08:37,613 --> 01:08:40,047
You think you're getting away with it?

906
01:09:05,307 --> 01:09:07,332
Mr. Gordon!

907
01:09:07,409 --> 01:09:09,900
- Is the boss in?
- Yes, indeedy.

908
01:09:38,741 --> 01:09:41,232
I screwed up the divorce.

909
01:09:42,878 --> 01:09:46,712
I agreed to everything
that she said.

910
01:09:46,782 --> 01:09:49,615
I just wanted her to like me.

911
01:09:49,685 --> 01:09:52,381
I wanted to be a good father.

912
01:09:53,923 --> 01:09:56,949
I have the documents.

913
01:09:57,026 --> 01:09:59,688
You know,

914
01:09:59,762 --> 01:10:03,630
It would help if you were married,
if there was someone at home
while you're at work.

915
01:10:03,699 --> 01:10:06,964
I plan to soon.

916
01:10:07,036 --> 01:10:09,231
How soon?

917
01:10:09,305 --> 01:10:12,536
- Next spring.
- It would help...

918
01:10:12,608 --> 01:10:15,577
if there was some change in circumstance
since this was drawn,

919
01:10:15,644 --> 01:10:21,446
if there was some drug or alcohol abuse
on the part of your ex-wife.

920
01:10:21,517 --> 01:10:24,509
Sexual problems upsetting the child.
I'm sorry!

921
01:10:24,587 --> 01:10:29,354
But these are the things
we're gonna have to explore
if we want to contest this document.

922
01:10:32,228 --> 01:10:36,562
- Does it have to get that messy?
- Absolutely.

923
01:10:36,632 --> 01:10:39,533
This is just the tip of the iceberg,
Mr. Whitehouse.

924
01:10:39,602 --> 01:10:43,368
I hope you understand
what I'm saying.

925
01:10:43,439 --> 01:10:45,703
Looks kind of hopeless, don't it?

926
01:10:45,774 --> 01:10:49,073
No, not really. I'll have
another look at the divorce decree,

927
01:10:49,144 --> 01:10:51,908
see if we can get it redrawn.

928
01:10:51,981 --> 01:10:55,508
But at some point, I'm going
to have to interview your daughter.

929
01:10:55,584 --> 01:10:59,020
- It's Jill, right?
- Yes.

930
01:10:59,088 --> 01:11:01,022
You got an ashtray?

931
01:11:06,895 --> 01:11:10,353
I'll need a $500 retainer.

932
01:11:10,432 --> 01:11:12,559
You can just mail it to me.

933
01:11:14,637 --> 01:11:18,403
- How much is the whole thing
gonna cost?
- It's hard to say.

934
01:11:18,474 --> 01:11:22,308
But if we go for custody, there's
depositions, psychiatric evaluations.

935
01:11:22,378 --> 01:11:26,075
But if we just want to get
the visitation rights redrawn,

936
01:11:26,148 --> 01:11:31,518
assuming they're unduly restrictive,
it wouldn't be more than $3,500.

937
01:11:31,587 --> 01:11:34,078
Oh.

938
01:11:34,156 --> 01:11:39,458
It might be in your best interest
legally as well as financially
to just go for...

939
01:11:39,528 --> 01:11:43,658
I know. The custody thing wasn't
just my trying to get back at her.

940
01:11:43,732 --> 01:11:46,792
I'm not as dumb as I look.

941
01:11:46,869 --> 01:11:49,963
I didn't say you
looked dumb, Mr. Whitehouse.

942
01:11:53,075 --> 01:11:56,238
I love my daughter.
I'll send you the $500.

943
01:12:01,050 --> 01:12:03,484
I'm sorry about the long lunch.

944
01:12:03,552 --> 01:12:05,520
My transmission's going out again.

945
01:12:05,587 --> 01:12:09,045
Did you ever think about
getting a new car?

946
01:12:09,124 --> 01:12:11,524
On what you pay me?

947
01:12:13,529 --> 01:12:16,692
Elaine, call Chub Merritt, have him pick
up Wade's shitbox, fix the transmission.

948
01:12:16,765 --> 01:12:18,699
What?

949
01:12:18,767 --> 01:12:23,761
Call Chub Merritt, have him pick up
Wade's car, fix the transmission.

950
01:12:23,839 --> 01:12:26,273
I'll bill the repair
to the town.

951
01:12:27,576 --> 01:12:31,672
You can use my four-by-four.

952
01:12:31,747 --> 01:12:33,681
You're the town police officer.

953
01:12:33,749 --> 01:12:36,877
The town police officer
should have a decent car.

954
01:12:38,487 --> 01:12:41,354
Well, you want a new car or not?

955
01:12:41,423 --> 01:12:44,392
- What do I have to do for it?
- Nothing.

956
01:12:44,460 --> 01:12:46,758
You know, Wade,
I've been thinking.

957
01:12:46,829 --> 01:12:49,730
You don't get enough
appreciation around here.

958
01:12:49,798 --> 01:12:54,428
- Uh-uh. I saw Mel Gordon
in here this morning.
- So?

959
01:12:54,503 --> 01:12:59,167
He say anything about
that summons I tried to give him?
Son of a bitch wouldn't accept it.

960
01:12:59,241 --> 01:13:01,209
- Wade, "dat" wasn't smart.
- "That?"

961
01:13:01,276 --> 01:13:04,336
Going out right after
the man's father-in-law shot himself.

962
01:13:04,413 --> 01:13:08,076
It's pronounced "that,"
not "dat." That.

963
01:13:08,150 --> 01:13:10,948
- That.
- Yeah.

964
01:13:11,019 --> 01:13:14,318
Let it go.
Call it a favor to me.

965
01:13:14,390 --> 01:13:16,324
You? Why?

966
01:13:16,392 --> 01:13:18,917
Well, Mel's doing
some business with me.

967
01:13:18,994 --> 01:13:21,519
It's nice to do a favor for people
you do business with.

968
01:13:21,597 --> 01:13:23,531
He was in a hurry.
It's no big deal.

969
01:13:23,599 --> 01:13:28,434
- That was before Twombley
was shot, before he knew.
- What's the difference?

970
01:13:28,504 --> 01:13:33,032
Take my truck, take a rest.
Stop worrying about Mel Gordon.

971
01:13:37,980 --> 01:13:40,847
Have you decided what to do
with your old man's place yet?

972
01:13:40,916 --> 01:13:43,316
You oughta sell it,
move into town.

973
01:13:43,385 --> 01:13:46,115
- You wanna buy?
- Don't light that here. I'm allergic.

974
01:13:46,188 --> 01:13:48,418
- I won't. You interested?
- Maybe.

975
01:13:48,490 --> 01:13:50,651
- You and Mel Gordon?
- Could be.

976
01:13:50,726 --> 01:13:54,423
- Always count on Wade
for a good screwing, huh?
- What are you talking about?

977
01:13:54,496 --> 01:13:58,227
Why should you guys make all the money?
You, Mel and Jack.

978
01:13:58,300 --> 01:14:03,237
- Right's right.
- I asked you not to light
that fucking thing in here.

979
01:14:03,305 --> 01:14:07,298
Get out of here
with that smoke!

980
01:15:59,521 --> 01:16:03,890
A hunting accident's perfect.

981
01:16:03,959 --> 01:16:06,120
Anything new
about the shooting?

982
01:16:06,194 --> 01:16:08,219
I think your first response
to the shooting was the correct one.

983
01:16:08,297 --> 01:16:10,822
Your friend, I think. Jack Hewitt.
He's my favorite.

984
01:16:10,899 --> 01:16:14,300
Money. Hunting accident.
I bet it wasn't an accident.

985
01:16:14,369 --> 01:16:17,031
It wasn't me. I wasn't there.
- The truth.

986
01:16:17,105 --> 01:16:20,666
Remember, it may have happened,
but not the way you said.

987
01:16:20,742 --> 01:16:24,405
It's what happened
not because it's neat.

988
01:16:28,984 --> 01:16:33,080
Twombley's sudden death.
Killing was the correct one.

989
01:16:33,155 --> 01:16:35,089
The truth, remember.

990
01:17:02,851 --> 01:17:07,481
You crazy son of a bitch!
You almost killed us both!

991
01:17:07,556 --> 01:17:09,717
Get off the fuckin' ice!

992
01:17:09,791 --> 01:17:11,918
Get off!

993
01:17:16,164 --> 01:17:18,132
What're you runnin' from, Jack?

994
01:17:19,835 --> 01:17:21,769
We're gonna talk.

995
01:17:29,778 --> 01:17:32,975
Stay back. I'll shoot you.

996
01:17:33,048 --> 01:17:36,814
I'll fuckin' shoot you dead
if you don't get back in that truck.

997
01:17:36,885 --> 01:17:39,979
You ain't shootin' shit.
Now put the gun away.

998
01:17:40,055 --> 01:17:41,920
Tell me what happened.

999
01:17:41,990 --> 01:17:46,427
Don't move!
I'll shoot you dead if you move.

1000
01:19:08,877 --> 01:19:10,970
Thanks a lot.

1001
01:19:23,558 --> 01:19:25,492
Stop that!

1002
01:19:25,560 --> 01:19:28,586
Who? Me?
I didn't do nothin'.

1003
01:19:31,867 --> 01:19:34,233
Just look what a good job I done here.

1004
01:19:34,302 --> 01:19:37,567
You haven't done anything. I should've
left you at home to stew in your drink.

1005
01:19:37,639 --> 01:19:39,573
Damn right you should have.

1006
01:19:41,309 --> 01:19:43,243
It's about time.

1007
01:19:43,311 --> 01:19:45,871
Your father's here.
Marge got to baby-sit him.

1008
01:19:45,947 --> 01:19:48,211
She moved in with you, huh?

1009
01:19:48,283 --> 01:19:51,741
- What happened?
- Don't even ask.

1010
01:19:51,820 --> 01:19:54,380
My, my, my.
The prodigal son.

1011
01:19:54,456 --> 01:19:56,390
About fuckin' time too.

1012
01:19:56,458 --> 01:19:59,256
I got me a new job.
Second cook and bottle washer.

1013
01:19:59,327 --> 01:20:01,693
Pop, for chrissake,
let's go home.

1014
01:20:01,763 --> 01:20:03,856
I'm sorry. I got waylaid.

1015
01:20:07,002 --> 01:20:09,129
The hell you got waylaid.

1016
01:20:09,204 --> 01:20:12,867
You follow your prick around
like it was your nose, for chrissake!

1017
01:20:12,941 --> 01:20:15,876
Can it, Whitehouse.
Get him out of here.

1018
01:20:15,944 --> 01:20:19,072
- It was funny at first, but I'm tired.
- Let's go home.

1019
01:20:19,147 --> 01:20:23,675
What home is that?
Is that your home or my home?

1020
01:20:23,752 --> 01:20:27,210
You're a fuckin' sly, Wade.

1021
01:20:27,289 --> 01:20:31,225
Now, your mom's dead. She can't
make any excuses for you anymore.

1022
01:20:31,293 --> 01:20:36,595
You've got to deal with me now.
No more sugar tit, sonny!

1023
01:20:36,665 --> 01:20:40,362
- For chrissake, Pop. Let's go home.
- Don't give me any of your lip.

1024
01:20:40,435 --> 01:20:42,960
- Get out of this fast.
- I can't.

1025
01:20:43,038 --> 01:20:44,972
Are you pushing me?

1026
01:20:48,543 --> 01:20:52,604
- Come on. My God.
- Don't push me!

1027
01:20:52,681 --> 01:20:55,980
- You think you can take me now?
Just come on.
- Come on.

1028
01:20:56,051 --> 01:20:59,145
- Just get in the car.
- What's the matter?

1029
01:20:59,221 --> 01:21:01,781
Just get in the car.

1030
01:21:01,857 --> 01:21:05,088
- Get in. Just get in.
- Wimp!

1031
01:21:05,160 --> 01:21:07,890
Why don't you grow up?

1032
01:21:07,963 --> 01:21:10,397
You never could stand up
for yourself!

1033
01:21:10,465 --> 01:21:12,490
Goddamn it!

1034
01:21:12,567 --> 01:21:17,504
- You could never understand
what it's about.
- I wish you'd die!

1035
01:21:17,572 --> 01:21:21,030
Oh, stop it!
Just stop it! Stop it!

1036
01:21:57,612 --> 01:22:00,581
No shit, Rolfe.
I glanced up and there he was,

1037
01:22:00,649 --> 01:22:03,243
only it was me.

1038
01:22:03,318 --> 01:22:06,412
But it was like
I had never seen myself before.

1039
01:22:06,488 --> 01:22:09,924
It was a stranger's face.
It's hard to explain.

1040
01:22:09,991 --> 01:22:15,793
You fly on automatic pilot, like I was
doing all night, and you disappear.

1041
01:22:15,864 --> 01:22:20,198
Then you accidentally see your body,
or your face, or whatever,

1042
01:22:20,268 --> 01:22:24,329
and you don't know
who in the hell it belongs to.

1043
01:22:24,406 --> 01:22:26,533
Strange.

1044
01:22:26,608 --> 01:22:31,307
It's the business with the old man,
I know, and how incredibly
pissed I was at him,

1045
01:22:31,379 --> 01:22:36,339
and chasing Jack Hewitt
and the goddamned truck,
not to mention Margie's being upset.

1046
01:22:36,418 --> 01:22:39,478
One thing on top of another.

1047
01:22:39,554 --> 01:22:41,954
Wade, are you all right?

1048
01:22:42,023 --> 01:22:44,719
You gotta hear this.
You won't believe it.

1049
01:22:44,793 --> 01:22:48,092
Mel Gordon had come by
to visit LaRiviere.

1050
01:22:48,163 --> 01:22:50,631
So they're in the office.

1051
01:22:50,699 --> 01:22:54,226
Mel Gordon realized
that I was onto them.

1052
01:22:54,302 --> 01:22:56,896
Mel thinks he can buy me off.

1053
01:22:56,972 --> 01:23:00,066
But LaRiviere,
he knew that wouldn't work.

1054
01:23:00,141 --> 01:23:04,100
Mel Gordon may be able
to buy off LaRiviere. That's one thing.

1055
01:23:04,179 --> 01:23:06,511
But not me.

1056
01:23:06,581 --> 01:23:11,917
How could a guy like Jack Hewitt
get into a mess like this?

1057
01:23:29,471 --> 01:23:32,167
- Coffee?
- Thank you, Alma.

1058
01:23:32,240 --> 01:23:35,698
- You want milk and sugar?
- No, no. Black is fine.

1059
01:23:35,777 --> 01:23:38,473
I like it this way.

1060
01:23:38,546 --> 01:23:41,037
You got yourself
a new computer, huh?

1061
01:23:41,116 --> 01:23:44,051
I've been putting
all my files into it.

1062
01:23:48,590 --> 01:23:50,615
You all right, Wade?

1063
01:23:50,692 --> 01:23:55,026
Yeah. I got this damn tooth.
It's killing me.

1064
01:23:56,998 --> 01:24:01,025
Got a few things bugging me,
just like everybody else.

1065
01:24:01,102 --> 01:24:03,036
I'm okay.

1066
01:24:03,104 --> 01:24:05,732
I don't mean to pry.

1067
01:24:07,308 --> 01:24:10,903
I'm sorry about your mother.
It was a nice funeral.

1068
01:24:12,280 --> 01:24:14,305
It's over now.

1069
01:24:15,784 --> 01:24:18,116
Alma,

1070
01:24:18,186 --> 01:24:21,986
I think there's some dirty business
goin' on in this town.

1071
01:24:22,057 --> 01:24:24,252
I know that.
There always has been.

1072
01:24:24,325 --> 01:24:29,160
No, no. I think this is a little worse
than you and I are used to.

1073
01:24:29,230 --> 01:24:33,599
I'm talkin' about murder,
among other things.

1074
01:24:33,668 --> 01:24:36,660
- Who?
- Twombley. Evan Twombley.

1075
01:24:36,738 --> 01:24:38,763
The union boss official
who got shot.

1076
01:24:38,840 --> 01:24:41,240
- Somebody murdered him.
- Who would...

1077
01:24:43,711 --> 01:24:47,977
You know Jack Hewitt,
the kid I work with?

1078
01:24:48,049 --> 01:24:51,644
Well, I think Jack shot him.

1079
01:24:51,719 --> 01:24:55,951
You know, Twombley was
the father-in-law of Mel Gordon.

1080
01:24:56,024 --> 01:24:58,254
That's a friend of LaRiviere's.

1081
01:24:58,326 --> 01:25:01,261
I don't know what
the connection is yet,

1082
01:25:01,329 --> 01:25:04,230
but LaRiviere had Jack
take him out hunting,

1083
01:25:04,299 --> 01:25:06,597
pretending it was an accident.

1084
01:25:08,937 --> 01:25:13,533
If Jack told the truth, he could
be free by the time he's my age.

1085
01:25:15,176 --> 01:25:17,610
Sometimes things
are simpler than you think.

1086
01:25:17,679 --> 01:25:21,115
- Let me ask you a question.
- You don't believe me?

1087
01:25:21,182 --> 01:25:24,310
About Jack? No.

1088
01:25:24,385 --> 01:25:28,253
Have you checked out the tax bill
on your father's farm lately?

1089
01:25:31,693 --> 01:25:35,720
Um, I know he's been due
for a couple of years.

1090
01:25:35,797 --> 01:25:39,733
I was thinkin' of paying it
when the insurance comes in.

1091
01:25:39,801 --> 01:25:42,565
Has anybody offered to buy it?

1092
01:25:42,637 --> 01:25:45,299
Yeah. Matter of fact, LaRiviere.

1093
01:25:49,544 --> 01:25:53,241
These are all
the real estate transactions
in this town for the last year.

1094
01:25:53,314 --> 01:25:58,718
Most of it is unused land. Most of it is
for little more than back taxes owed.

1095
01:25:58,786 --> 01:26:00,777
How's Lillian?

1096
01:26:00,855 --> 01:26:03,517
She's fine.

1097
01:26:03,591 --> 01:26:05,650
That's three years ago.

1098
01:26:05,727 --> 01:26:07,661
It's quite a difference, hmm?

1099
01:26:07,729 --> 01:26:11,165
What's the North Country
Development Association?

1100
01:26:11,232 --> 01:26:13,700
Went down to Concord.
I checked it out.

1101
01:26:13,768 --> 01:26:15,702
Mel Gordon is the president.

1102
01:26:15,770 --> 01:26:19,228
And the vice president
and treasurer is Gordon LaRiviere.

1103
01:26:19,307 --> 01:26:24,973
They're buying up the whole mountain.
$364,000 last year.

1104
01:26:25,046 --> 01:26:29,039
I believe that's a little
outside of LaRiviere's league.

1105
01:26:29,117 --> 01:26:31,551
- Is Twombley involved?
- No.

1106
01:26:34,722 --> 01:26:36,656
Hmm.

1107
01:26:38,193 --> 01:26:40,127
He must've found out.

1108
01:26:42,730 --> 01:26:45,130
They had to get rid of him.

1109
01:26:45,200 --> 01:26:48,897
And Jack...
Jack will get blamed for it.

1110
01:26:48,970 --> 01:26:51,165
All these figures show is that...

1111
01:26:51,239 --> 01:26:55,676
Gordon LaRiviere is gonna be a very rich
man because of his being a selectman.

1112
01:26:55,743 --> 01:26:59,839
In a year or two,
you're not gonna recognize this town.

1113
01:26:59,914 --> 01:27:03,042
Oh, boy. Oh, boy!

1114
01:27:19,968 --> 01:27:22,402
You sneaky son of a bitch!
I got your number now!

1115
01:27:22,470 --> 01:27:26,634
All these years
I thought you were a decent man.
Ran around feeling grateful to you.

1116
01:27:26,708 --> 01:27:29,108
Can you believe that? Grateful!

1117
01:27:29,177 --> 01:27:31,805
- You're fired!
- He's using us.

1118
01:27:31,879 --> 01:27:35,212
- We're his slaves. We're alike.
- What were you doing with my truck?

1119
01:27:35,283 --> 01:27:40,311
- Are you a quitter? Quitter!
- You're finished. Gimme the keys.

1120
01:27:40,388 --> 01:27:42,515
I give it with pleasure.
I'm free of you.

1121
01:27:42,590 --> 01:27:46,185
- You're not on my back anymore.
You see how easy it is?
- Keep your hands off me.

1122
01:27:46,261 --> 01:27:51,893
I'll handle this.
Break it up. Break it up, Wade!

1123
01:27:51,966 --> 01:27:54,958
Break it up! Wade!

1124
01:27:55,036 --> 01:27:58,665
You ain't gettin' away with this!
You ain't gettin' away with it!

1125
01:27:58,740 --> 01:28:02,369
Stay out of it, Jimmy. You're fired.
I want the shop keys. Where are they?

1126
01:28:02,443 --> 01:28:05,970
Wade, get out of here! Just go!

1127
01:28:06,047 --> 01:28:08,015
I gotta call my brother.

1128
01:28:14,922 --> 01:28:18,858
Yeah, I know what it means.
I'm just runnin' out of ways to use it.

1129
01:28:18,926 --> 01:28:21,793
- Why? For what?
- To help Jack.

1130
01:28:21,863 --> 01:28:24,798
To nail those sons of bitches.
You know, the two Gordons.

1131
01:28:24,866 --> 01:28:28,802
That's what Alma calls them.
Jesus, Rolfe, whose side are you on?

1132
01:28:28,870 --> 01:28:32,966
Wade, listen.
Take care of the little things first,

1133
01:28:33,041 --> 01:28:36,477
the things that are distracting you
from taking care of the big things.

1134
01:28:36,544 --> 01:28:38,978
Call Chub Merritt,
get your car back.

1135
01:28:39,047 --> 01:28:41,982
Call a dentist
and get your tooth pulled.

1136
01:28:42,050 --> 01:28:44,075
Forget about the hunting accident.

1137
01:28:44,152 --> 01:28:46,450
Let it go.

1138
01:28:49,757 --> 01:28:51,782
Wade?

1139
01:28:51,859 --> 01:28:56,421
- Chick.
- The good news is,
we haven't got to your car yet.

1140
01:28:56,497 --> 01:28:59,432
- The bad news...
- Just tell me when you have it fixed.

1141
01:28:59,500 --> 01:29:03,596
The bad news is there's a problem with
Gordon's truck, which somebody shot up.

1142
01:29:03,671 --> 01:29:07,732
- Figured you'd know
something about that, Wade.
- Yeah, I know about that.

1143
01:29:07,809 --> 01:29:10,607
LaRiviere says he ain't gonna pay
for fixing your car.

1144
01:29:10,678 --> 01:29:12,942
It's a couple hundred
for the transmission.

1145
01:29:13,014 --> 01:29:15,710
I got more bad news.
Wanna hear it?

1146
01:29:15,783 --> 01:29:18,115
- Yeah, tell me.
- Chub says you're fired.

1147
01:29:18,186 --> 01:29:21,087
He can't fire me.
LaRiviere already did that this morning.

1148
01:29:21,155 --> 01:29:23,089
Your other job for the town.

1149
01:29:23,157 --> 01:29:27,856
Chub's a selectman. Said to turn
your badge in and clean out your office.

1150
01:29:31,966 --> 01:29:35,094
What do you mean you can't
take me today? I told you it's...

1151
01:29:35,169 --> 01:29:38,332
Shit! Shit! Shit!

1152
01:29:38,406 --> 01:29:40,431
- Wade?
- What?

1153
01:29:40,508 --> 01:29:43,500
What in the world
is happening to you?

1154
01:29:43,578 --> 01:29:48,515
- Why are you acting this way?
- It's my tooth! It's my goddamn tooth!

1155
01:29:48,583 --> 01:29:51,211
I can't even think anymore
because of it.

1156
01:29:51,285 --> 01:29:55,415
You got fired this morning,
didn't ya?

1157
01:29:55,490 --> 01:29:58,323
Margie, look.
That's temporary, believe me.

1158
01:29:58,393 --> 01:30:01,590
There's so much shit that's gonna
hit the fan in the next few days,

1159
01:30:01,662 --> 01:30:04,961
and my getting fired by LaRiviere
and Merritt won't matter a bit.

1160
01:30:12,373 --> 01:30:15,274
I'll get another job.

1161
01:30:15,343 --> 01:30:17,834
People are gonna need me.
After this is over,

1162
01:30:17,912 --> 01:30:20,005
they're gonna make me
into a goddamn hero!

1163
01:30:20,081 --> 01:30:24,984
You wait, you'll see. I'll deliver.
I'll be the best father that ever lived.

1164
01:30:25,052 --> 01:30:28,613
You need me. Even Pop!
For chrissake, he needs me!

1165
01:30:28,689 --> 01:30:31,214
This town needs me!

1166
01:30:31,292 --> 01:30:34,090
I'll get another job.
Maybe right now...

1167
01:30:34,162 --> 01:30:37,996
they think they can send me howling
into the corner like a kicked dog!

1168
01:30:38,065 --> 01:30:40,966
But by God,
it'll be different soon!

1169
01:30:43,171 --> 01:30:46,572
Always been a whiner. God!

1170
01:30:46,641 --> 01:30:52,102
Now, my old man, there was...
There was a real man.

1171
01:30:52,180 --> 01:30:55,115
He let no woman push him around.

1172
01:30:56,617 --> 01:30:59,051
Worked till the day he died.

1173
01:31:01,322 --> 01:31:05,656
Yeah, men like him
were real men.

1174
01:31:07,261 --> 01:31:11,197
And women knew their place.
There was no confusion.

1175
01:31:13,100 --> 01:31:16,399
Women respected men then.
It wasn't like it is today...

1176
01:31:16,471 --> 01:31:18,598
Be careful what you say,
Glen Whitehouse.

1177
01:31:18,673 --> 01:31:23,133
I know you.
My mother knew your wife.

1178
01:31:23,211 --> 01:31:25,441
Oh, what she went through.

1179
01:31:25,513 --> 01:31:28,175
Don't you sass me, damn it!

1180
01:31:29,884 --> 01:31:32,148
You think you're
pretty hot stuff, huh?

1181
01:31:32,220 --> 01:31:34,654
Well, you're gettin' old too.

1182
01:31:34,722 --> 01:31:38,852
And there's not a goddamn thing
a woman can do about that.

1183
01:31:40,461 --> 01:31:42,622
Is there?

1184
01:31:57,812 --> 01:32:00,872
Gimme the bottle.

1185
01:32:00,948 --> 01:32:03,382
Sure.

1186
01:33:05,379 --> 01:33:07,313
You will say that I should've known...

1187
01:33:07,381 --> 01:33:09,815
terrible things
were about to happen.

1188
01:33:09,884 --> 01:33:12,682
You will say
that I was responsible.

1189
01:33:12,753 --> 01:33:17,417
But even so, what could
I have done by then?

1190
01:33:17,491 --> 01:33:21,018
Wade lived on the edge
of his emotions.

1191
01:33:21,095 --> 01:33:24,963
He was always first to receive
the brunt of our father's anger.

1192
01:33:25,032 --> 01:33:27,865
He had no perspective
to retreat to,

1193
01:33:27,935 --> 01:33:30,267
even in a crisis.

1194
01:34:21,889 --> 01:34:23,880
Wait there.
She'll be right out.

1195
01:34:23,958 --> 01:34:26,324
I thought we'd go
out to the farm, see my dad.

1196
01:34:26,394 --> 01:34:29,454
- Get your boots.
- Hi, honey.

1197
01:34:29,530 --> 01:34:33,057
- Have her home tomorrow night by 6:00.
- That's no problem.

1198
01:34:33,134 --> 01:34:37,537
Lillian, I'm sorry. I had
this damn tooth, and I got it pulled.

1199
01:34:37,605 --> 01:34:40,130
- God, you make me sick.
- What?

1200
01:34:40,207 --> 01:34:42,698
I can't believe
you would sink this low.

1201
01:34:42,777 --> 01:34:46,235
- Low as what? What have I done?
- Your lawyer called.

1202
01:34:46,313 --> 01:34:49,282
Yeah. Is that bad to want
to see your own daughter?

1203
01:34:49,350 --> 01:34:51,284
Don't play dumb.

1204
01:34:51,352 --> 01:34:56,051
For what this will do to her,
this kid you say you love so much.

1205
01:34:56,123 --> 01:34:58,990
Love, Wade?

1206
01:34:59,060 --> 01:35:02,826
Really? Shame on you!

1207
01:35:02,897 --> 01:35:04,831
Shame on you.

1208
01:35:04,899 --> 01:35:09,927
- Bye, sweetie. Call me tonight
if you feel like it.

1209
01:35:10,004 --> 01:35:12,302
Are we going in this?

1210
01:35:12,373 --> 01:35:15,137
Yeah, my car's in the shop.
This'll be fine.

1211
01:35:15,209 --> 01:35:18,178
- It's pretty old.
- It belongs to Pop.

1212
01:35:20,648 --> 01:35:23,515
- Pop?
- Yeah, my father. You know who he is.

1213
01:35:23,584 --> 01:35:26,075
Pop. It's his.

1214
01:35:26,153 --> 01:35:28,087
Yeah.

1215
01:35:31,726 --> 01:35:34,388
Well, how 'bout a Big Mac?

1216
01:35:34,462 --> 01:35:38,694
Mom won't let me eat fast food.
You know that. It's bad for you.

1217
01:35:38,766 --> 01:35:44,170
Come on. We can always sneak
a Big Mac like we used to.

1218
01:35:44,238 --> 01:35:48,868
- And a cherry turnover.
What do you say, Jillie?
- No.

1219
01:35:48,943 --> 01:35:51,503
- What do you want then?
- Nothing.

1220
01:35:51,579 --> 01:35:54,241
Come on, you can't have nothing.
We gotta have lunch.

1221
01:35:54,315 --> 01:35:56,749
- Mr. Pizzeria?
- Same thing, Dad.

1222
01:35:56,817 --> 01:36:01,982
- Mom says all that food is bad for you.
- I don't care what Mom says.

1223
01:36:02,056 --> 01:36:04,115
I'm in charge today, okay?

1224
01:36:04,191 --> 01:36:08,924
Okay. We'll get what you want.
What do you want?

1225
01:36:08,996 --> 01:36:13,126
What do I want?
Well, I don't know.

1226
01:36:13,200 --> 01:36:16,727
I guess I can wait till we get home.
Maybe we'll stop at Wickham's.

1227
01:36:16,804 --> 01:36:19,568
- Okay.
- Fine. Fine.

1228
01:36:25,679 --> 01:36:27,670
Are you okay?

1229
01:36:27,748 --> 01:36:31,047
Ah, Jillie, come on.
Come on, honey.

1230
01:36:31,118 --> 01:36:34,451
Don't get sad on me.
I'm sorry.

1231
01:36:34,522 --> 01:36:37,457
- I'm sorry.
- What are you sorry for?

1232
01:36:39,093 --> 01:36:41,653
What am I sorry for?

1233
01:36:41,729 --> 01:36:45,722
Well, I don't know.
I guess it was the food business.

1234
01:36:45,800 --> 01:36:50,294
I just thought we'd sneak a Big Mac
on Mommy like we used to.

1235
01:36:50,371 --> 01:36:52,601
I wanna go home.

1236
01:36:56,277 --> 01:36:59,405
You can't.

1237
01:36:59,480 --> 01:37:01,539
That's illegal, you know.

1238
01:37:01,615 --> 01:37:04,277
I know.

1239
01:37:04,351 --> 01:37:06,285
You're a policeman.

1240
01:37:06,353 --> 01:37:10,414
No, not anymore.

1241
01:37:10,491 --> 01:37:12,425
I'm nothin' anymore.

1242
01:37:28,976 --> 01:37:32,070
Here we go.
Go on, grab that pocket.

1243
01:37:32,146 --> 01:37:34,376
So, what do we want?

1244
01:37:34,448 --> 01:37:36,780
Come on, Jillie, what do we want?
Jillie, Jillie, Jillie!

1245
01:37:36,851 --> 01:37:39,149
We want a cheese
grilled sandwich?

1246
01:37:39,220 --> 01:37:42,678
It's called
a grilled cheese sandwich, you dub.

1247
01:37:53,601 --> 01:37:55,660
Jill! Jill, I'm sorry.

1248
01:37:55,736 --> 01:37:58,705
Honey, nothin' happened.
Nothin' happened.

1249
01:37:58,772 --> 01:38:02,003
- I wanna go home.
- Oh, yeah. Sure, honey.

1250
01:38:02,076 --> 01:38:06,035
We'll go home right now.
I'm sorry. Nothin' happened.

1251
01:38:06,113 --> 01:38:08,411
Let's go. Come on.

1252
01:38:10,551 --> 01:38:15,386
Wade, I got a message for ya.
Jack Hewitt, he's lookin' for you.

1253
01:38:15,456 --> 01:38:18,186
He wants you to clear your stuff
out of his office in town hall.

1254
01:38:18,259 --> 01:38:22,821
- His office? You mean my old office.
- That's what he said.

1255
01:38:24,198 --> 01:38:27,133
I'd stay away from him
if I were you.

1256
01:38:27,201 --> 01:38:29,260
He's real pissed.

1257
01:38:31,906 --> 01:38:33,931
Are you all right, Nick?

1258
01:39:27,795 --> 01:39:30,025
You goin' somewhere, Margie?

1259
01:39:30,097 --> 01:39:34,431
I'm just clearing out some of the stuff
that's piled up for the rummage sale.

1260
01:39:34,501 --> 01:39:39,495
And some of it's
for the cleaners and the Laundromat.

1261
01:39:39,573 --> 01:39:42,906
Don't lie to me, Marge.
You're leaving me. I can see that.

1262
01:39:42,977 --> 01:39:44,911
Don't be silly.

1263
01:39:46,947 --> 01:39:48,881
Hi, Jill.

1264
01:39:54,822 --> 01:39:56,881
Marge.

1265
01:40:08,802 --> 01:40:11,293
Oh, Marge.

1266
01:40:12,473 --> 01:40:16,102
Oh. Oh.
Help me, Marge.

1267
01:40:16,176 --> 01:40:18,110
Leave me alone!

1268
01:40:18,178 --> 01:40:23,480
- Leave me alone!
- Leave her alone! Leave her alone!

1269
01:40:23,550 --> 01:40:25,643
Leave her alone!

1270
01:40:36,497 --> 01:40:39,625
- I wanna go home.
Will you take me home?
- Jill.

1271
01:40:42,403 --> 01:40:44,337
Jill?

1272
01:41:14,668 --> 01:41:16,659
Oh, my.

1273
01:41:16,737 --> 01:41:21,470
You! By Christ!

1274
01:41:21,542 --> 01:41:23,669
You! I know you!

1275
01:41:25,946 --> 01:41:27,914
Ah, yes.

1276
01:41:27,981 --> 01:41:31,439
You. Yeah, you goddamn...

1277
01:41:31,518 --> 01:41:33,543
son of a bitch.

1278
01:41:33,620 --> 01:41:36,145
I know you.

1279
01:41:36,223 --> 01:41:39,989
You're my blood. You're a goddamn
fuckin' piece of my heart.

1280
01:41:41,695 --> 01:41:44,391
You don't know me.

1281
01:41:44,465 --> 01:41:47,593
You don't know me.

1282
01:41:47,668 --> 01:41:49,602
Fuck you.

1283
01:41:49,670 --> 01:41:52,605
Fuck you!

1284
01:41:52,673 --> 01:41:56,541
You done finally done it.

1285
01:41:56,610 --> 01:42:00,603
Done it right.
Done it like a man done it.

1286
01:42:00,681 --> 01:42:03,047
Just the way I taught ya.

1287
01:42:03,117 --> 01:42:07,383
Oh, goddamn!

1288
01:42:07,454 --> 01:42:10,082
I love you,
you mean son of a bitch.

1289
01:42:10,157 --> 01:42:14,560
- I do.
- Love. What do you know about love?

1290
01:42:14,628 --> 01:42:18,655
Love? Hell,
I'm made of love.

1291
01:42:18,732 --> 01:42:21,360
Call it what you want.

1292
01:42:21,435 --> 01:42:23,403
Everything you know...

1293
01:42:23,470 --> 01:42:26,200
- comes from me.
- Yeah.

1294
01:42:26,273 --> 01:42:27,399
Bang!

1295
01:42:30,043 --> 01:42:31,977
You and me!

1296
01:42:33,680 --> 01:42:36,148
Where the hell you goin'?

1297
01:42:36,216 --> 01:42:40,778
Where you goin', Wade? Best you leave
my goddamn truck where it is.

1298
01:42:40,854 --> 01:42:44,790
Wade, I need to...
Gimme those keys.

1299
01:42:44,858 --> 01:42:47,383
Wade! I need to get to town.

1300
01:42:47,461 --> 01:42:50,294
Crawl.

1301
01:42:50,364 --> 01:42:54,960
There's hardly any booze left in
the house. I gotta get me some Brown's.

1302
01:42:55,035 --> 01:42:57,731
Hey!

1303
01:42:57,804 --> 01:43:01,399
It's my house, my money,

1304
01:43:01,475 --> 01:43:04,239
my goddamn truck!

1305
01:43:04,311 --> 01:43:06,472
Stolen!

1306
01:43:11,451 --> 01:43:14,477
You and me.

1307
01:43:14,555 --> 01:43:18,150
You and me.

1308
01:43:18,225 --> 01:43:20,557
I don't know you.

1309
01:43:20,627 --> 01:43:23,960
My own goddamn father,
and I don't know you.

1310
01:43:24,031 --> 01:43:26,226
You and me.

1311
01:43:44,318 --> 01:43:46,684
Don't you sass me, goddamn it.

1312
01:44:10,811 --> 01:44:13,006
I love you too.

1313
01:44:20,921 --> 01:44:22,889
Ha. Joke.

1314
01:44:28,462 --> 01:44:30,692
Pop?

1315
01:44:43,343 --> 01:44:45,402
Pop?

1316
01:44:48,982 --> 01:44:50,916
Dad.

1317
01:44:54,488 --> 01:44:56,422
Dad.

1318
01:48:10,517 --> 01:48:12,508
Ahh.

1319
01:48:34,875 --> 01:48:38,106
The historical facts
are known by everyone.

1320
01:48:38,178 --> 01:48:43,377
All of Lawford, all of New Hampshire,
some of Massachusetts.

1321
01:48:43,450 --> 01:48:46,214
Facts do not make history.

1322
01:48:46,286 --> 01:48:49,619
Our stories, Wade's and mine,

1323
01:48:49,689 --> 01:48:54,149
describe the lives of the boys and men
for thousands of years:

1324
01:48:54,227 --> 01:48:56,889
Boys who were beaten
by their fathers,

1325
01:48:56,963 --> 01:49:01,332
whose capacity for love and trust
was crippled almost at birth,

1326
01:49:01,401 --> 01:49:04,837
men whose best hope for connection
with other human beings...

1327
01:49:04,905 --> 01:49:06,839
lay in detachment...

1328
01:49:06,907 --> 01:49:09,535
as if life were over.

1329
01:49:09,609 --> 01:49:12,976
It's how we keep from destroying
in turn our own children...

1330
01:49:13,046 --> 01:49:16,914
and terrorizing the women
who have the misfortune to love us;

1331
01:49:16,983 --> 01:49:20,749
how we absent ourselves from
the tradition of male violence;

1332
01:49:20,820 --> 01:49:24,847
how we decline
the seduction of revenge.

1333
01:49:24,925 --> 01:49:29,453
Jack's truck turned up three days later
in a shopping mall in Toronto.

1334
01:49:29,529 --> 01:49:32,794
Wade killed Jack...

1335
01:49:32,866 --> 01:49:36,859
Just as surely as Jack
did not kill Evan Twombley,

1336
01:49:36,937 --> 01:49:39,497
even accidentally.

1337
01:49:39,573 --> 01:49:43,976
The link between Jack and Twombley,
LaRiviere and Mel Gordon...

1338
01:49:44,044 --> 01:49:47,377
existed only
in Wade's wild imaginings.

1339
01:49:47,447 --> 01:49:51,110
And briefly, I admit,
in mine as well.

1340
01:49:52,419 --> 01:49:56,685
LaRiviere and Mel Gordon
were indeed in business.

1341
01:49:56,756 --> 01:50:01,625
The Parker Mountain Ski Resort
is now advertised across the country.

1342
01:50:01,695 --> 01:50:05,290
The community of Lawford,
as such, no longer exists.

1343
01:50:05,365 --> 01:50:09,995
It is an economic zone
between Littleton and Catamount.

1344
01:50:10,070 --> 01:50:14,370
The house is still in Wade's name,
and I keep paying taxes on it.

1345
01:50:14,441 --> 01:50:16,909
It remains empty.

1346
01:50:16,977 --> 01:50:20,435
Now and then I drive out there
and sit in my car,

1347
01:50:20,513 --> 01:50:23,277
and wonder why not let it go.

1348
01:50:23,350 --> 01:50:28,287
Why not let LaRiviere buy it and
build the condominiums he wants there?

1349
01:50:29,689 --> 01:50:33,250
We want to believe Wade died
that same November,

1350
01:50:33,326 --> 01:50:37,092
froze to death on a bench
or a sidewalk.

1351
01:50:37,163 --> 01:50:39,631
You cannot understand
how a man,

1352
01:50:39,699 --> 01:50:43,635
a normal man, a man like you and me,
could do such a terrible thing.

1353
01:50:45,872 --> 01:50:50,707
Unless the police happen
to arrest a vagrant who
turns out to be Wade Whitehouse,

1354
01:50:50,777 --> 01:50:54,144
there will be
no more mention of him.

1355
01:50:54,214 --> 01:50:57,342
Or his friend Jack Hewitt.

1356
01:50:57,417 --> 01:51:00,113
Or our father.

1357
01:51:00,186 --> 01:51:03,121
The story will be over,

1358
01:51:03,189 --> 01:51:06,750
except that I continue.

1
00:03:01,265 --> 00:03:02,390
Move! Move it!

2
00:03:02,474 --> 00:03:05,977
Move!

3
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:07,311
Now!

4
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:38,259
It's me home.

5
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:40,136
- Bye, Bruno!
- Bye, Bruno!

6
00:04:06,038 --> 00:04:09,040
- Hello, sweetheart.
- Mum, what's going on?

7
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:11,959
- We're celebrating.
- Celebrating?

8
00:04:12,044 --> 00:04:13,961
Your father's been given a promotion.

9
00:04:14,046 --> 00:04:17,006
- That means a betterjob.
- I know what promotion is.

10
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:18,966
So we're having a little party
to celebrate.

11
00:04:19,051 --> 00:04:21,427
He's still going to be a soldier though,
isn't he?

12
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:25,348
Yes, my love.
Yes, just a more important one now.

13
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:28,267
There's some even more exciting news...

14
00:04:28,352 --> 00:04:31,812
but I think Dad wanted
to tell you about that himself.

15
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:37,068
- Moving? Where to?
- To the countryside.

16
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:41,822
That's miles away.
What about Karl and Leon and Martin?

17
00:04:41,907 --> 00:04:43,324
Sweetheart, I know it's hard...

18
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:46,994
but we're all having to say good-bye
to our friends for the time being.

19
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:49,664
Anyway, we'll make new ones
where we're going. Won't we?

20
00:04:49,748 --> 00:04:53,000
Of course you are.
You'll make lots of new friends.

21
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:57,922
Bruno, you can have your friends
around in the morning before we go.

22
00:04:58,006 --> 00:05:01,425
Think of it as an adventure,
like in one of your books.

23
00:05:02,386 --> 00:05:04,762
But this is the best house ever.

24
00:05:05,389 --> 00:05:09,016
Well, you never know. The house
we're going to might be even better.

25
00:05:09,101 --> 00:05:11,268
Dad says it's got a garden.

26
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:17,191
Look, the thing is, Bruno,
the thing about being a soldier...

27
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:20,486
is that life is not so much about choice,
it's more about duty...

28
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:23,489
so ifyour country needs
you to go somewhere, you'll go.

29
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:27,034
Now, of course, going somewhere else
is much easier...

30
00:05:27,119 --> 00:05:31,038
when you know that your family
are so delighted to go with you.

31
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:17,209
Bruno! You're getting bigger
every time I see you.

32
00:06:17,294 --> 00:06:19,503
It's only been a week, Nathalie.

33
00:06:19,588 --> 00:06:22,506
Well, perhaps it's me
that's getting smaller.

34
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:25,926
So, you two...

35
00:06:26,011 --> 00:06:29,180
well, what do you think of all this?
Moving out of Berlin?

36
00:06:29,264 --> 00:06:32,016
Well, Mummy and Daddy say
it's a good thing, so I suppose it must be.

37
00:06:35,854 --> 00:06:39,815
Children, be angels, will you?
Pass some food around.

38
00:06:46,031 --> 00:06:47,782
Heil Hitler!

39
00:07:23,235 --> 00:07:24,693
Congratulations.

40
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:29,573
- Doesn't he look wonderful?
- Absolutely.

41
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:32,743
I'm so proud of you, my boy.

42
00:07:33,495 --> 00:07:37,665
Oh, dear. I sometimes wonder
if this is all down to me,

43
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:41,627
making you those costumes
for your little plays when you were tiny.

44
00:07:42,087 --> 00:07:45,840
- You used to adore all that dressing up.
- Nathalie.

45
00:07:45,924 --> 00:07:48,884
Does it still make you feel special,
Ralf dear?

46
00:07:49,761 --> 00:07:52,847
The uniform and what it stands for?

47
00:07:52,931 --> 00:07:56,433
Mother, it's a party.
Let's not spoil things.

48
00:07:57,102 --> 00:07:59,103
Me, spoil things?

49
00:08:00,772 --> 00:08:02,606
You should be careful.

50
00:08:02,691 --> 00:08:05,860
Airing your views so publicly
could land you in trouble.

51
00:08:05,944 --> 00:08:07,403
You know that.

52
00:08:09,531 --> 00:08:12,867
So, how long are we losing you for,
my boy?

53
00:08:12,951 --> 00:08:17,997
- Until the war is won, I would think.
- Well, not so long then.

54
00:09:26,775 --> 00:09:28,025
Bruno!

55
00:09:33,448 --> 00:09:36,784
All right, Bruno. Time to say good-bye.

56
00:10:04,396 --> 00:10:06,313
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye!

57
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:45,185
"Time has come for me to sleep
Lord, I thank Thee for Thy keep

58
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:48,689
Watch this night well over me
And teach me, Lord, to trust in Thee

59
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:52,192
Care for children, sick and poor
Grant them, Lord, Thy blessing more

60
00:10:52,277 --> 00:10:55,779
And this I pray in Jesus' name
Care for my familyjust the same"

61
00:10:55,864 --> 00:10:56,905
Amen.

62
00:11:41,576 --> 00:11:45,746
Children, look. Look! Our new home.

63
00:12:34,796 --> 00:12:38,465
I have some business to take care of.
I'll see you shortly.

64
00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:57,317
Well, what do we think?

65
00:13:00,238 --> 00:13:02,322
Come on. It's lovely.

66
00:13:02,407 --> 00:13:05,868
You two choose your rooms.
I'll have Maria come...

67
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:09,413
and help you unpack.

68
00:13:23,595 --> 00:13:27,097
What do you think of it, Maria?
The new house.

69
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:32,186
It's not for me to say.

70
00:13:34,189 --> 00:13:38,442
But it won't feel like home
until we make it feel like home, will it?

71
00:13:44,908 --> 00:13:46,783
Is he already up?

72
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:53,290
Who was that?

73
00:13:53,374 --> 00:13:55,959
One of your father's soldiers,
I suppose.

74
00:13:56,085 --> 00:14:00,464
- He looked very serious.
- Well, they are, aren't they?

75
00:14:04,302 --> 00:14:08,472
- Why are we whispering?
- I don't know.

76
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:47,678
- And play with who?
- The children over on the farm.

77
00:14:47,762 --> 00:14:50,764
Farm? I didn't see a farm.
And that one, too.

78
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:53,183
You can only see it from my room.

79
00:14:53,685 --> 00:14:55,602
And are some children there?

80
00:14:55,687 --> 00:14:58,480
- Yes, quite a few.
- That's good.

81
00:14:58,565 --> 00:15:02,359
- So, I'll be able to play with them.
- I don't see why not.

82
00:15:02,777 --> 00:15:06,697
I'll wait a little bit,
just to see what they're like...

83
00:15:06,781 --> 00:15:10,033
- because they look a bit strange.
- The children do?

84
00:15:10,785 --> 00:15:13,495
- Well, and the farmers.
- What sort of strange?

85
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:20,210
I'm sorry.

86
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:22,045
Vegetables.

87
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,048
There.

88
00:15:29,512 --> 00:15:30,846
Bruno, have you unpacked everything?

89
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:33,932
Because I think you should
go back upstairs and finish off.

90
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:38,687
Thank you, ma'am.

91
00:15:42,692 --> 00:15:44,067
Bruno.

92
00:15:44,694 --> 00:15:46,945
- I told you they were strange.
- Who?

93
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:49,698
The farmers. They wear pajamas.

94
00:16:07,342 --> 00:16:09,885
Bruno, I was just
coming to look for you.

95
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:12,512
Well, thank you for that.
That was extremely useful.

96
00:16:12,597 --> 00:16:16,266
- I'll be over to see you later.
- Of course, Herr Kommandant.

97
00:16:16,351 --> 00:16:17,726
Come in.

98
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:23,940
Sit down, sit down.

99
00:16:25,109 --> 00:16:27,110
Well, what do you think?

100
00:16:29,197 --> 00:16:30,447
Oh, dear.

101
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:32,783
I want to go home.

102
00:16:34,619 --> 00:16:38,538
You are home, Bruno.
Home is where the family is.

103
00:16:38,623 --> 00:16:40,290
Isn't that right?

104
00:16:42,377 --> 00:16:46,505
Bruno, you have to at least
give the place a chance.

105
00:16:46,589 --> 00:16:48,215
I promise you,
it won't be long before you-

106
00:16:48,299 --> 00:16:53,345
Why do the farmers wear pajamas?
I can see them from my window.

107
00:17:01,896 --> 00:17:06,316
The thing is, Bruno, those people-

108
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:10,278
Well, you see,
they're not really people at all.

109
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:17,160
Bruno, who told you it was a farm?

110
00:17:17,245 --> 00:17:18,995
- Was it Maria?
- No.

111
00:17:19,664 --> 00:17:21,289
It is a farm, isn't it?

112
00:17:23,251 --> 00:17:24,000
Yes.

113
00:17:26,587 --> 00:17:29,047
Is it to do with your new job?

114
00:17:29,132 --> 00:17:31,883
All you need to know
about my work here, Bruno...

115
00:17:31,968 --> 00:17:35,721
is that it's very important
to our country and to you.

116
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:38,932
We're working very hard
to make this world a better place...

117
00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:40,016
for you to grow up in.

118
00:17:40,101 --> 00:17:42,853
But you're not a farmer.
You're a soldier.

119
00:17:43,521 --> 00:17:46,565
Bruno, can you come and help me
finish sorting out in the kitchen?

120
00:17:46,649 --> 00:17:50,527
I can still play with them, though?
The children.

121
00:17:51,446 --> 00:17:53,780
I don't think so, Bruno. No.

122
00:17:53,865 --> 00:17:57,409
Like you say, they're a bit strange.
A bit—

123
00:17:57,493 --> 00:17:59,453
Well, they're different.

124
00:18:00,037 --> 00:18:02,706
Don't worry, my darling.
We'll find you some new friends...

125
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:05,500
but they won't be the ones
from the farm.

126
00:18:06,002 --> 00:18:07,085
Ralf, you promised.

127
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:09,337
- You said it was miles away.
- It is.

128
00:18:09,422 --> 00:18:12,132
How was I to know he could see it
from the bedroom window?

129
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:14,801
There was one of them in our kitchen.

130
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:58,887
- Master Bruno, how are you today?
- Fed up.

131
00:19:00,348 --> 00:19:03,266
You said the same thing
every day for two whole weeks.

132
00:19:03,351 --> 00:19:06,353
- It's true.
- Well, you should be out playing.

133
00:19:06,437 --> 00:19:09,606
- Playing with who?
- I don't know. Gretel?

134
00:19:10,942 --> 00:19:15,821
- Well, you can make your own fun.
- That's what I'm trying to do.

135
00:19:15,905 --> 00:19:17,113
One thing's for sure...

136
00:19:17,198 --> 00:19:20,951
sitting around being miserable
won't make things any happier.

137
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:16,089
- Bruno, what are you doing?
- Exploring!

138
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:19,384
No! No, not in the back.
I told you, it's out of bounds.

139
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:22,429
- Explore at the front.
- But I've explored it all.

140
00:20:22,513 --> 00:20:25,307
- Well, find something else to do.
- Like what?

141
00:20:26,309 --> 00:20:29,436
Come back in now,
and we'll think of something.

142
00:20:57,882 --> 00:20:59,591
So, children,
what are you doing today?

143
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:01,968
- Same as yesterday.
- And what was that?

144
00:21:02,053 --> 00:21:05,513
- Same as the day before.
- Except you went exploring.

145
00:21:06,891 --> 00:21:09,434
- I like exploring.
- Where did you go?

146
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:13,355
I wanted to look in the back garden,
but Mum wouldn't let me.

147
00:21:13,439 --> 00:21:14,773
The back garden?

148
00:21:15,858 --> 00:21:17,400
Well, God forbid.

149
00:21:17,485 --> 00:21:19,736
I expect you'll be missing
those friends of yours.

150
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,196
I even miss school.

151
00:21:23,157 --> 00:21:26,117
Well, I never thought
I'd hear you say that.

152
00:21:26,202 --> 00:21:28,119
Anyway, you won't be missing it
for long.

153
00:21:28,204 --> 00:21:31,289
- Really?
- I've arranged a tutor for you both.

154
00:21:32,083 --> 00:21:34,918
A Herr Liszt
will be visiting twice a week.

155
00:21:35,753 --> 00:21:38,505
So we're not going to school?

156
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:42,592
School's coming here?

157
00:21:43,427 --> 00:21:45,887
On an old bicycle, I gather.

158
00:22:04,115 --> 00:22:06,366
It's a bird without the-

159
00:22:31,642 --> 00:22:34,894
Good morning, little man.
And how are you this morning?

160
00:22:35,646 --> 00:22:38,732
- Can I ask you a favor?
- Well, you can ask.

161
00:22:40,151 --> 00:22:42,736
Are there any spare tires around?

162
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:45,280
An old one
from one of the trucks or something?

163
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:48,199
Well, the only spare tire
I've seen around here...

164
00:22:48,284 --> 00:22:50,618
belongs to Lieutenant Meinberg.

165
00:22:56,417 --> 00:22:59,836
- Well, is he using it?
- Yes, he's very attached to it.

166
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:03,590
Stop it. He doesn't understand.
He's only eight.

167
00:23:03,674 --> 00:23:07,177
You're only 12,
so stop pretending you're any older.

168
00:23:09,346 --> 00:23:11,222
What do you want a tire for, anyway?

169
00:23:11,307 --> 00:23:14,267
- I want to make a swing.
- A swing?

170
00:23:14,351 --> 00:23:16,352
That does sound exciting.

171
00:23:22,902 --> 00:23:23,902
You!

172
00:23:25,321 --> 00:23:26,529
Here, now.

173
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:30,575
Move!

174
00:23:33,162 --> 00:23:36,581
Take this boy to the outhouse
in the back garden.

175
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:38,708
There are some tires in there.
He will select one.

176
00:23:38,793 --> 00:23:42,170
You will carry it where he asks.
Do you understand?

177
00:23:46,217 --> 00:23:48,384
Well, little man,
what are you waiting for?

178
00:24:32,805 --> 00:24:34,639
How about this one?

179
00:25:21,687 --> 00:25:23,730
Where's my mum?

180
00:25:25,608 --> 00:25:26,816
She's out.

181
00:25:27,735 --> 00:25:30,236
- When is she back?
- Soon, I expect.

182
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:33,156
But don't worry.

183
00:25:35,034 --> 00:25:38,453
- But I might bleed to death.
- No, you won't.

184
00:25:45,502 --> 00:25:50,506
- Will I need to go to hospital?
- No. It's only a small cut.

185
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:55,678
Come on. It's not that bad.

186
00:25:56,555 --> 00:25:59,891
There, all better.

187
00:26:12,154 --> 00:26:15,573
- What's your name?
- Pavel.

188
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:20,745
Now, you better sit still
for a few minutes...

189
00:26:21,163 --> 00:26:23,831
before you start
walking around on that again.

190
00:26:23,916 --> 00:26:26,000
Will you tell my mum what happened?

191
00:26:27,544 --> 00:26:30,380
I think she's going to see it for herself.

192
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:33,925
She'll probably want to take me
to a doctor.

193
00:26:35,302 --> 00:26:36,928
I don't think so.

194
00:26:37,137 --> 00:26:40,306
- It could be worse than it looks.
- It isn't.

195
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:44,269
How would you know?
You're not a doctor.

196
00:26:48,732 --> 00:26:51,734
- Yes, I am.
- No, you're not.

197
00:26:51,819 --> 00:26:53,111
You peel potatoes.

198
00:26:54,989 --> 00:26:57,073
I practiced as a doctor.

199
00:26:58,242 --> 00:26:59,909
Before l-

200
00:26:59,994 --> 00:27:01,661
Before I came here.

201
00:27:03,163 --> 00:27:07,041
You couldn't have been much good
then, ifyou had to practice.

202
00:27:15,592 --> 00:27:20,221
Now, what are you going to be
when you grow up?

203
00:27:21,265 --> 00:27:24,434
I know. An explorer.

204
00:27:25,102 --> 00:27:26,394
How do you know that?

205
00:27:30,232 --> 00:27:31,441
Is it nice on the farm?

206
00:27:41,035 --> 00:27:43,661
Bruno. Bruno, what happened to you?

207
00:27:43,746 --> 00:27:47,498
I made a swing,
but I fell off it and cut my knee.

208
00:27:47,583 --> 00:27:51,210
But Pavel here, he carried me in
and put a bandage on it.

209
00:27:58,427 --> 00:28:00,428
- Go to your room.
- But Pavel says l—

210
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:02,680
Don't argue. Go to your room.

211
00:28:30,834 --> 00:28:32,168
Thank you.

212
00:28:56,610 --> 00:28:59,237
It's not fair, you having this view.

213
00:28:59,321 --> 00:29:01,197
Well, I'm not swapping.

214
00:29:06,328 --> 00:29:08,246
I think school's here.

215
00:29:09,998 --> 00:29:12,250
No, I mean more recent history.

216
00:29:12,334 --> 00:29:16,087
- Are you interested in current affairs?
- Yes, very.

217
00:29:16,171 --> 00:29:19,924
So, you'll be aware of the situation...

218
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:21,926
in which our great nation
presently finds itself.

219
00:29:22,469 --> 00:29:26,806
Yes. I read newspapers whenever I can
and one of Father's men...

220
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:28,891
keeps me up to date
on everything that's happening.

221
00:29:28,976 --> 00:29:33,563
Good. And you, Bruno.
Have you been reading newspapers?

222
00:29:35,357 --> 00:29:39,026
- Have you been reading anything?
- Books.

223
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:43,156
Good. What sort of books?

224
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:45,116
Adventure books, mainly.

225
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:50,288
You know, knights in shining armor,
exploring strange lands and stuff...

226
00:29:50,372 --> 00:29:53,040
and silly princesses
always getting in the way.

227
00:29:53,125 --> 00:29:57,545
Well, this is why I'm here to help.
You're how old now, Bruno? Eight?

228
00:29:58,755 --> 00:30:00,631
Time to get your head
out of those fiction books...

229
00:30:00,716 --> 00:30:02,800
and start learning about fact.

230
00:30:02,885 --> 00:30:06,846
Time, I think,
to turn your mind to the real world...

231
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:09,599
and I believe
this would be the perfect start.

232
00:31:45,654 --> 00:31:47,071
Die, die!

233
00:31:58,125 --> 00:32:00,293
Die, die.

234
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:55,097
Hello.

235
00:33:01,146 --> 00:33:02,688
I'm exploring.

236
00:33:08,403 --> 00:33:12,448
- What are you doing?
- We're- We're building a new hut.

237
00:33:18,121 --> 00:33:20,915
Have you got lots of friends over there?

238
00:33:21,792 --> 00:33:24,919
A few. But we fight a lot.

239
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:29,632
That's why I like being out here.
I can be on my own.

240
00:33:32,135 --> 00:33:34,845
- I'm Bruno.
- Shmuel.

241
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:37,473
- Sorry?
- I'm Shmuel.

242
00:33:39,101 --> 00:33:42,937
That's your name? Never heard
of anyone called that before.

243
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:45,231
I've never heard
of anyone called Bruno.

244
00:33:45,315 --> 00:33:49,276
But Shmuel. No one's called Shmuel.

245
00:33:55,158 --> 00:33:57,493
I live in the house, back there.

246
00:34:00,664 --> 00:34:03,499
- Have you got any food on you?
- No.

247
00:34:04,918 --> 00:34:06,460
Are you hungry?

248
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:17,304
How old are you?

249
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:20,391
- Eight.
- Me, too!

250
00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:30,359
It's not fair,
me being stuck over here on my own...

251
00:34:30,444 --> 00:34:32,945
while you're over there,
playing with friends all day.

252
00:34:33,029 --> 00:34:36,240
- Playing?
- Well, that number.

253
00:34:36,575 --> 00:34:39,994
- Isn't it a part of a game or something?
- It's just my number.

254
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:42,455
Everyone gets given
a different number.

255
00:34:42,539 --> 00:34:44,540
Right. Then what happens?

256
00:34:48,003 --> 00:34:50,463
- I have to go back now!
- Really?

257
00:34:50,547 --> 00:34:51,589
Yeah.

258
00:34:52,215 --> 00:34:55,134
It was nice to meet you, Shmuel.

259
00:34:55,218 --> 00:34:57,511
And you, Bruno.

260
00:35:08,273 --> 00:35:09,398
Bye.

261
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:23,412
Mum, I can't find my football.

262
00:35:23,497 --> 00:35:25,706
Well, it'll be
in one of your cupboards, sweet.

263
00:35:25,791 --> 00:35:27,625
It isn't. I've looked.

264
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:30,711
Can I have a piece of chocolate?

265
00:35:31,379 --> 00:35:32,838
A piece. Yes.

266
00:35:39,763 --> 00:35:41,305
Bruno?

267
00:35:41,389 --> 00:35:45,392
- Have you looked in the cellar?
- The cellar?

268
00:35:45,477 --> 00:35:47,478
For your football.

269
00:36:26,810 --> 00:36:27,935
Damn.

270
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:57,506
- Gretel, I've just seen all your...
- All my what?

271
00:36:58,633 --> 00:37:01,802
All your dolls, down in the cellar.

272
00:37:02,679 --> 00:37:05,806
Dolls are for little girls.

273
00:37:05,891 --> 00:37:08,559
It's not right to be playing
with silly toys...

274
00:37:08,643 --> 00:37:12,563
while people are away
risking their lives for the Fatherland.

275
00:37:53,188 --> 00:37:57,441
- "My people's density is my density."
- Destiny.

276
00:37:59,986 --> 00:38:03,697
"Its struggles and its sorrows,
its joys and its miseries are mine.

277
00:38:03,782 --> 00:38:07,409
I must work and create
for the resurrection of my Fatherland.

278
00:38:07,494 --> 00:38:10,079
The history of my people
is great and glorious."

279
00:38:10,163 --> 00:38:11,664
And it's 12:00.

280
00:38:14,751 --> 00:38:18,045
- I'm sorry?
- Isn't that when we finish?

281
00:38:18,964 --> 00:38:22,132
The termination of the lesson
is for the tutor to decide, Bruno...

282
00:38:22,217 --> 00:38:25,135
not the pupil.
Now, will you please continue?

283
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:42,194
Bruno, there you are.

284
00:38:43,154 --> 00:38:46,532
I'm just going into town for an hour.
Do you want to come?

285
00:38:48,827 --> 00:38:51,036
You be careful on that thing.

286
00:38:51,371 --> 00:38:52,579
Thank you.

287
00:39:10,849 --> 00:39:13,058
Can I ask you something?

288
00:39:13,143 --> 00:39:15,853
Why do you people
wear pajamas all day?

289
00:39:16,521 --> 00:39:20,190
- They're not pajamas.
- Well, those.

290
00:39:20,734 --> 00:39:23,777
We have to.
They took all our other clothes away.

291
00:39:23,862 --> 00:39:25,696
- Who did?
- The soldiers.

292
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:27,448
The soldiers? Why?

293
00:39:30,452 --> 00:39:33,454
I don't like soldiers. Do you?

294
00:39:34,122 --> 00:39:37,249
I do, quite. My dad's a soldier...

295
00:39:37,917 --> 00:39:40,502
but not the sort that takes
people's clothes away for no reason.

296
00:39:41,296 --> 00:39:42,880
What sort, then?

297
00:39:44,716 --> 00:39:47,426
Well, he's the important sort.

298
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:50,971
He's in charge of making
everything better for everyone.

299
00:39:53,016 --> 00:39:56,935
- So is your dad a farmer?
- No, he's a watchmaker.

300
00:39:58,521 --> 00:40:02,775
Or was. Most of the time now,
he just mends boots.

301
00:40:05,695 --> 00:40:07,863
It's funny how grown-ups
can't make their minds up...

302
00:40:07,947 --> 00:40:11,033
about what they want to do.
It's like Pavel.

303
00:40:11,117 --> 00:40:13,577
Do you know him? Lives over there.

304
00:40:15,038 --> 00:40:19,750
He used to be a doctor,
but gave it all up to peel potatoes.

305
00:40:29,385 --> 00:40:30,928
Can I ask you another question?

306
00:40:31,012 --> 00:40:33,597
What do you burn in those chimneys?

307
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:37,351
I saw them going the other day.
Is it just lots of hay and stuff?

308
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:40,479
I don't know.
We're not allowed over there.

309
00:40:40,563 --> 00:40:42,231
Mama says it's old clothes.

310
00:40:42,857 --> 00:40:45,400
Well, whatever it is, it smells horrid.

311
00:40:48,905 --> 00:40:51,073
I wish
you'd remembered the chocolate.

312
00:40:51,157 --> 00:40:52,783
Yes, I'm sorry.

313
00:40:52,867 --> 00:40:55,619
I know! Perhaps you can come
and have supper with us sometime.

314
00:40:55,703 --> 00:40:58,497
I can't, can I? Because of this.

315
00:40:59,249 --> 00:41:01,750
But that's to stop
the animals getting out, isn't it?

316
00:41:01,835 --> 00:41:05,337
Animals?
No, it's to stop people getting out.

317
00:41:05,421 --> 00:41:07,589
Are you not allowed out?

318
00:41:08,550 --> 00:41:12,636
- Why? What have you done?
- I'm a Jew.

319
00:41:25,275 --> 00:41:26,942
I think I should go now.

320
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:34,741
- Will you be here tomorrow?
- I'll try.

321
00:41:34,826 --> 00:41:37,494
- Good-bye, then!
- Bye.

322
00:41:41,958 --> 00:41:44,042
Little present, sweetheart.

323
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:49,298
Thank you, Mummy.

324
00:41:57,223 --> 00:42:00,642
- Have you seen Bruno?
- Outside on his swing, I think.

325
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:17,910
Yes, Thursday's perfect.
I'll have a car come to collect you both.

326
00:42:17,994 --> 00:42:20,162
Are Grandma and Grandpa coming?

327
00:42:21,331 --> 00:42:24,875
Hey, did you smell
that horrible smell the other day?

328
00:42:24,959 --> 00:42:27,878
- Coming from the chimneys.
- What sort of ill?

329
00:42:29,672 --> 00:42:31,840
The day I fell off the swing.

330
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:35,302
- Did you smell it, Mum?
- Father.

331
00:42:35,386 --> 00:42:36,762
Mum.

332
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:40,265
Let me speak to her.

333
00:42:40,350 --> 00:42:42,267
Yes, she is. I can hear her.

334
00:42:45,688 --> 00:42:48,023
Yes. We look forward to it. Good-bye.

335
00:42:53,821 --> 00:42:56,198
- Is Grandma not coming?
- No.

336
00:42:56,699 --> 00:43:00,202
She's poorly, apparently,
but Grandpa's coming.

337
00:43:02,372 --> 00:43:04,498
- Did you smell it, Dad?
- What?

338
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:08,085
That horrid smell from the chimneys.
What is it?

339
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:14,132
I think theyjust burn rubbish
there sometimes.

340
00:43:14,217 --> 00:43:15,926
- Look.
- What?

341
00:43:19,138 --> 00:43:20,514
- Hey!
- Gretel.

342
00:43:22,475 --> 00:43:23,684
Hey, that's not fair!

343
00:43:23,768 --> 00:43:25,227
- Gretel.
- What?

344
00:43:26,145 --> 00:43:27,771
It's only a game.

345
00:43:33,152 --> 00:43:35,529
Ralf, this tutor you brought in...

346
00:43:35,738 --> 00:43:39,491
does he usually teach children
as young as Gretel and Bruno?

347
00:43:40,118 --> 00:43:41,743
I believe so. Why?

348
00:43:41,828 --> 00:43:43,745
Well, do we know
what he's teaching them?

349
00:43:43,830 --> 00:43:45,664
Gretel seems to have become so-

350
00:43:45,748 --> 00:43:48,292
They're being taught what all children
are being taught at the moment.

351
00:43:48,376 --> 00:43:50,127
They mustn't get left behind.

352
00:43:51,546 --> 00:43:52,754
Come on.

353
00:43:54,757 --> 00:43:56,383
Let's get to bed.

354
00:44:07,103 --> 00:44:09,813
"The Jew slandered us
and incited our enemies.

355
00:44:09,897 --> 00:44:12,274
The Jew corrupted us
through bad books.

356
00:44:12,358 --> 00:44:14,359
He mocked
our literature and our music.

357
00:44:14,444 --> 00:44:16,862
Everywhere, his influence
was destructive...

358
00:44:16,946 --> 00:44:20,115
the eventual result of which
was our nation's collapse...

359
00:44:20,199 --> 00:44:21,783
- and then—"
- Yes, Bruno?

360
00:44:22,535 --> 00:44:24,786
I don't understand.

361
00:44:24,871 --> 00:44:27,414
A nation's collapse
is all down to this one man?

362
00:44:27,957 --> 00:44:31,460
The Jew here
means the entire Jewish race.

363
00:44:31,544 --> 00:44:33,503
If it had been just one man...

364
00:44:33,588 --> 00:44:36,256
I'm sure something
would've been done about him.

365
00:44:38,301 --> 00:44:41,470
There is such a thing as a nice Jew,
though, isn't there?

366
00:44:41,554 --> 00:44:45,307
I think, Bruno,
ifyou ever found a nice Jew...

367
00:44:46,476 --> 00:44:49,519
you would be
the best explorer in the world.

368
00:44:53,733 --> 00:44:55,359
Continue, Gretel.

369
00:44:57,320 --> 00:45:00,405
"The aim of the Jew
is to become the ruler of humanity.

370
00:45:00,490 --> 00:45:03,158
The Jew is not creative,
but destructive.

371
00:45:03,242 --> 00:45:05,660
He is the enemy of culture.

372
00:45:05,745 --> 00:45:09,081
Thousands of Germans
have been made poor by the Jew."

373
00:45:22,428 --> 00:45:23,929
Master Bruno.

374
00:45:24,889 --> 00:45:28,517
What are you doing? You've just
had your lunch, haven't you?

375
00:45:28,601 --> 00:45:32,437
I was going for a walk,
and I thought I might get peckish.

376
00:45:32,522 --> 00:45:35,524
But don't make a mess of your satchel.
Bring it here.

377
00:45:35,608 --> 00:45:39,903
- I'll wrap it properly for you.
- No. It's none of your business.

378
00:45:39,987 --> 00:45:41,696
Bruno, what is it?

379
00:45:42,573 --> 00:45:44,991
What are you doing with your satchel?

380
00:45:45,076 --> 00:45:49,704
Herr Liszt gave us some books.
I'm going out on the swing to read.

381
00:45:51,207 --> 00:45:53,291
- Let me see.
- What?

382
00:45:53,376 --> 00:45:56,086
- The books.
- No.

383
00:45:56,170 --> 00:45:59,381
Bruno, I just want to see
what books Herr Liszt has given you.

384
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:03,176
- I told a lie.
- What?

385
00:46:04,554 --> 00:46:06,054
I've just got...

386
00:46:08,683 --> 00:46:10,267
adventure books.

387
00:46:18,609 --> 00:46:20,569
Go on. Off you go, then.

388
00:46:24,532 --> 00:46:26,825
Now, Maria,
there's two extra for supper tonight.

389
00:46:26,909 --> 00:46:28,076
The Kommandant's father will be here...

390
00:46:28,161 --> 00:46:30,495
and I believe
Lieutenant Kotler is joining us.

391
00:46:53,352 --> 00:46:54,478
Here.

392
00:47:05,948 --> 00:47:07,616
What's the matter?

393
00:47:10,161 --> 00:47:12,829
- Don't throw it back.
- What? Why not?

394
00:47:14,582 --> 00:47:16,666
- It's dangerous.
- Dangerous?

395
00:47:16,751 --> 00:47:18,335
It's just a ball. Come on.

396
00:47:22,423 --> 00:47:23,632
Do you not like playing?

397
00:47:27,887 --> 00:47:30,639
- J ust not ball games?
- Not here.

398
00:47:35,853 --> 00:47:39,689
- Tell me how the number game works.
- I told you, it's not a game.

399
00:47:39,774 --> 00:47:41,608
We just all have numbers.

400
00:47:48,366 --> 00:47:49,824
Shmuel!

401
00:48:03,631 --> 00:48:05,674
Bruno! What are you doing?

402
00:48:07,426 --> 00:48:10,554
My ball went over.
I was just getting it back.

403
00:48:20,398 --> 00:48:23,233
They smell even worse
when they burn, don't they?

404
00:48:23,317 --> 00:48:24,401
What?

405
00:48:41,335 --> 00:48:43,044
But, surely you-

406
00:48:58,853 --> 00:49:01,271
Elsa, I was sworn to secrecy.

407
00:49:01,355 --> 00:49:03,565
- From your own wife.
- Yes.

408
00:49:07,737 --> 00:49:12,032
I took an oath upon my life.
Do you understand?

409
00:49:13,659 --> 00:49:17,412
Elsa, you believe in this, too.

410
00:49:17,496 --> 00:49:22,417
- You want this country to be strong-
- No, Ralf, no! No, not that!

411
00:49:27,131 --> 00:49:28,590
How can you-

412
00:49:28,674 --> 00:49:30,300
- Because I'm a soldier.
- How can you—

413
00:49:30,384 --> 00:49:33,136
- Soldiers fight wars.
- That isn't war!

414
00:49:33,220 --> 00:49:35,930
It's a part of it! It's a vital part of it!

415
00:49:37,433 --> 00:49:41,436
The Fatherland we all desire,
all of us, you included...

416
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:44,397
cannot be achieved
without work such as this!

417
00:49:47,151 --> 00:49:52,489
- Elsa. Elsa.
- Get away from me! Get away from me!

418
00:49:56,702 --> 00:49:57,869
Grandpa's here.

419
00:49:57,953 --> 00:50:00,747
- I don't believe this.
- Grandpa's here.

420
00:50:04,251 --> 00:50:06,628
We'll be through in a moment.

421
00:50:16,347 --> 00:50:18,348
Who told you about this?

422
00:50:50,214 --> 00:50:52,215
How's Grandma?

423
00:50:52,299 --> 00:50:54,759
She's a bit under the weather,
I'm afraid.

424
00:50:54,844 --> 00:50:58,930
It's a shame, she was so much
looking forward to seeing you.

425
00:50:59,014 --> 00:51:02,475
- Perhaps next time, if she feels up to it.
- Absolutely.

426
00:51:09,358 --> 00:51:13,945
You know, Ralf,
your mother really is sick.

427
00:51:14,947 --> 00:51:17,615
She's been talking about this visit
for weeks.

428
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:19,868
Maybe that's what's made her sick.

429
00:51:26,834 --> 00:51:30,420
So, your father tells me
that you've got a tutor.

430
00:51:30,671 --> 00:51:32,922
Yes. He's nice.

431
00:51:33,007 --> 00:51:36,468
But he won't let us read
any adventure books.

432
00:51:36,552 --> 00:51:38,887
All we do is boring, old history.

433
00:51:39,472 --> 00:51:41,431
Let me tell you something, young man.

434
00:51:41,515 --> 00:51:46,019
If it wasn't for history, we wouldn't
all be sitting around this table.

435
00:51:46,103 --> 00:51:48,730
The work your father is doing here...

436
00:51:49,774 --> 00:51:51,941
history in the making.

437
00:52:02,244 --> 00:52:05,789
When I was your age, history was
my favorite subject by miles...

438
00:52:05,873 --> 00:52:08,500
which obviously
didn't please my father.

439
00:52:08,584 --> 00:52:09,918
Why not?

440
00:52:10,002 --> 00:52:12,962
Well, he was a professor of literature
at the university.

441
00:52:13,047 --> 00:52:16,925
Really, does he still teach?

442
00:52:19,386 --> 00:52:22,889
- I don't really know.
- You don't know?

443
00:52:25,851 --> 00:52:30,522
We're not in touch, my father and I.
He left the country some time ago.

444
00:52:33,108 --> 00:52:34,776
Really, when?

445
00:52:36,946 --> 00:52:40,240
About four years ago,
Herr Kommandant.

446
00:52:43,786 --> 00:52:48,248
But surely he can't be very old.
What is he, still in his 40s, late 40s?

447
00:52:49,083 --> 00:52:50,166
Where did he go?

448
00:52:58,717 --> 00:53:00,426
Lieutenant Kotler...

449
00:53:01,762 --> 00:53:05,306
your father, the professor of literature,
where did he go?

450
00:53:11,146 --> 00:53:14,190
I believe it was Switzerland,
Herr Kommandant.

451
00:53:15,526 --> 00:53:17,902
How strange that he should choose
to leave the Fatherland...

452
00:53:17,987 --> 00:53:19,487
at the very moment it needed him most.

453
00:53:19,572 --> 00:53:22,365
Just when we're all required
to play our part in the national revival.

454
00:53:22,449 --> 00:53:23,825
More wine!

455
00:53:26,245 --> 00:53:28,997
What reason did he give?
Was he tubercular?

456
00:53:31,959 --> 00:53:33,543
Did he go there to take the air?

457
00:53:36,171 --> 00:53:37,964
I'm afraid I really don't know,
Herr Kommandant.

458
00:53:38,048 --> 00:53:40,008
You'd have to ask him.

459
00:53:40,092 --> 00:53:42,802
Well, that would be rather difficult,
wouldn't it?

460
00:53:42,887 --> 00:53:45,013
With him being in Switzerland.

461
00:53:45,848 --> 00:53:46,890
Come on!

462
00:53:48,309 --> 00:53:50,852
What's the matter with you tonight?

463
00:53:59,028 --> 00:54:04,032
Yes, perhaps that was it.
Perhaps he was ill.

464
00:54:06,035 --> 00:54:08,369
U nless, of course,
he had disagreements.

465
00:54:10,664 --> 00:54:14,083
- I mean, with government policy.
- One hears of such men.

466
00:54:14,585 --> 00:54:18,880
Disturbed, most of them,
orjust plain cowards.

467
00:54:18,964 --> 00:54:22,634
- Even so, all of them traitors.
- Absolutely right.

468
00:54:22,718 --> 00:54:26,971
Presumably,
if that was the case with your father...

469
00:54:27,056 --> 00:54:30,767
you will have informed your superiors,
as is your duty.

470
00:54:32,895 --> 00:54:34,103
Lieutenant Kotler!

471
00:54:35,522 --> 00:54:38,566
You cretin Jew! Filth!

472
00:54:50,788 --> 00:54:52,121
Ralf!

473
00:54:56,752 --> 00:54:58,002
Jew!

474
00:54:59,171 --> 00:55:03,007
- But Dad just sat there.
- What did you expect him to do?

475
00:55:03,092 --> 00:55:04,258
The Jew deserved it.

476
00:55:13,936 --> 00:55:17,772
Can I ask you something
about the farm?

477
00:55:17,856 --> 00:55:20,775
Bruno, you don't still think it's a farm,
do you?

478
00:55:39,628 --> 00:55:43,506
It's a camp. What's called a work camp.

479
00:55:43,590 --> 00:55:46,092
ForJews, obviously.

480
00:55:47,636 --> 00:55:49,429
J ust Jews?

481
00:55:50,305 --> 00:55:53,141
Because they're the best workers?

482
00:55:53,225 --> 00:55:54,892
They're not in there
because they're good, silly.

483
00:55:54,977 --> 00:55:57,145
They're no good at anything.

484
00:55:57,229 --> 00:55:58,813
They're in there because they're evil.

485
00:55:58,897 --> 00:56:01,232
- They're the enemy.
- The enemy?

486
00:56:01,316 --> 00:56:03,651
- But I thought we were fighting-
- They're evil, Bruno.

487
00:56:03,736 --> 00:56:05,653
Evil, dangerous vermin.

488
00:56:06,321 --> 00:56:08,031
They're the reason
we lost the Great War.

489
00:56:09,158 --> 00:56:13,119
Haven't you been listening to anything
Herr Liszt has been telling us?

490
00:56:13,203 --> 00:56:14,620
No. Not really.

491
00:56:17,499 --> 00:56:20,710
Dad's not horrible, is he?
He's a good man.

492
00:56:20,794 --> 00:56:25,381
- Of course, he is.
- But he's in charge of a horrible place.

493
00:56:25,841 --> 00:56:28,092
It's only horrible for them, Bruno.

494
00:56:28,177 --> 00:56:30,678
We should be proud of Dad,
now more than ever before.

495
00:56:30,763 --> 00:56:33,389
He's making the country great again.

496
00:57:25,567 --> 00:57:28,778
Like you say, they're a bit strange.
A bit...

497
00:57:28,862 --> 00:57:29,904
Well, they're different.

498
00:57:29,988 --> 00:57:31,989
They're the enemy, Bruno.

499
00:57:32,074 --> 00:57:33,783
Evil, dangerous vermin.

500
00:57:33,867 --> 00:57:37,078
Well, you see,
they're not really people at all.

501
00:58:01,103 --> 00:58:03,521
What are you doing here?

502
00:58:03,605 --> 00:58:07,775
They wanted someone with tiny fingers
to clean all these.

503
00:58:20,664 --> 00:58:23,708
We're not supposed to be friends,
you and me.

504
00:58:23,792 --> 00:58:26,752
We're meant to be enemies.
Did you know that?

505
00:58:33,802 --> 00:58:35,469
Do you want some?

506
00:58:45,981 --> 00:58:48,608
- What's your dad like?
- What's he like?

507
00:58:49,109 --> 00:58:50,735
Is he a good man?

508
00:58:53,655 --> 00:58:55,448
You've never thought he wasn't?

509
00:58:58,619 --> 00:59:00,661
And you're proud of him?

510
00:59:01,997 --> 00:59:04,040
Aren't you proud of yours?

511
00:59:08,420 --> 00:59:10,630
Is it really horrible in the camp?

512
00:59:11,548 --> 00:59:13,507
How dare you
talk to people in the house.

513
00:59:13,592 --> 00:59:15,843
How dare you!

514
00:59:18,347 --> 00:59:19,889
Are you eating?

515
00:59:22,476 --> 00:59:24,644
Have you been stealing food?

516
00:59:28,482 --> 00:59:32,276
- Answer me!
- No, sir. He gave it to me.

517
00:59:33,445 --> 00:59:35,363
He's my friend.

518
00:59:37,324 --> 00:59:38,699
What?

519
00:59:41,328 --> 00:59:42,203
Little man...

520
00:59:44,539 --> 00:59:46,707
do you know this Jew?

521
00:59:46,792 --> 00:59:48,417
Do you know this Jew?

522
00:59:48,502 --> 00:59:51,379
No, I just walked in,
and he was helping himself.

523
00:59:51,838 --> 00:59:54,840
I've never seen him before in my life.

524
01:00:03,517 --> 01:00:06,018
You, finish cleaning the glasses.

525
01:00:07,396 --> 01:00:09,021
When I come back,
we'll have a little chat...

526
01:00:09,106 --> 01:00:12,942
about what happens to rats who steal.
Come away.

527
01:01:54,586 --> 01:01:57,088
New arrivals here are happy
to discover that life in the camp...

528
01:01:57,172 --> 01:01:58,297
is not all work.

529
01:01:58,382 --> 01:02:01,675
And that there's
ample opportunity for leisure also.

530
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:04,136
At the end of their day
at the ironmongery...

531
01:02:04,221 --> 01:02:06,764
or the build or boot factory,
the workers can enjoy...

532
01:02:06,848 --> 01:02:10,184
the many forms of pastime
that the camp has to offer.

533
01:02:11,103 --> 01:02:13,813
Organized sport is very popular.

534
01:02:13,897 --> 01:02:16,982
Those that don't play
certainly enjoy watching.

535
01:02:19,069 --> 01:02:20,486
At the end of the working day...

536
01:02:20,570 --> 01:02:22,947
the centrally located café
is the ideal place...

537
01:02:23,031 --> 01:02:27,618
for friends and families to join together
for a hearty and nutritious meal.

538
01:02:28,328 --> 01:02:32,498
The children, in particular,
enjoy the pastries and cakes on offer.

539
01:02:38,004 --> 01:02:40,548
In the evenings,
the occasional music concerts...

540
01:02:40,632 --> 01:02:43,634
either by visiting orchestras
or, indeed, by talented musicians...

541
01:02:43,718 --> 01:02:46,554
from within the camp itself,
are always well attended.

542
01:02:48,849 --> 01:02:51,308
Other recreations include
reading in the library...

543
01:02:51,393 --> 01:02:57,273
pottery, cookery, art and horticulture
for adult and child alike.

544
01:02:57,357 --> 01:03:01,527
Almost any activity one could wish for
is available within the camp.

545
01:03:07,534 --> 01:03:08,409
Splendid.

546
01:03:18,920 --> 01:03:20,921
- Bravo. Excellent.
- Thank you.

547
01:04:07,636 --> 01:04:09,470
Good-bye, little man.

548
01:04:56,184 --> 01:04:58,018
Shmuel! Shmuel!

549
01:05:15,203 --> 01:05:17,288
I don't understand.

550
01:05:17,372 --> 01:05:19,873
I saw a film about the camp...

551
01:05:21,209 --> 01:05:23,127
and it looked so nice.

552
01:05:30,552 --> 01:05:32,553
I don't know why I did it.

553
01:05:32,971 --> 01:05:35,723
Gretel and everyone
were saying all these things...

554
01:05:35,807 --> 01:05:37,975
and that soldier's so scary.

555
01:05:43,273 --> 01:05:46,900
Been coming here for days,
but you were never here.

556
01:05:46,985 --> 01:05:51,822
I thought maybe
we weren't friends anymore.

557
01:06:00,248 --> 01:06:04,627
Shmuel, I'm really sorry for what I did.
We are still friends, aren't we?

558
01:06:36,201 --> 01:06:39,662
Where's Kurt these days?
I haven't seen him for ages.

559
01:06:41,164 --> 01:06:44,958
- Who's Kurt?
- Lieutenant Kotler.

560
01:06:46,628 --> 01:06:48,962
He's been moved to the front.

561
01:06:49,047 --> 01:06:50,923
It was felt that
his youth and enthusiasm...

562
01:06:51,007 --> 01:06:52,758
would be put to better use there.

563
01:06:52,842 --> 01:06:54,968
Herr Kommandant, telephone.

564
01:06:55,887 --> 01:06:58,389
I n actual fact, Gretel, he was sent there...

565
01:06:58,473 --> 01:07:00,224
because he failed
to inform the authorities...

566
01:07:00,308 --> 01:07:02,559
of his father's
lack of loyalty to the Party.

567
01:07:02,644 --> 01:07:04,603
Which was his duty, I might add.

568
01:07:04,688 --> 01:07:06,772
- Which was his bad luck.
- Bad luck?

569
01:07:06,856 --> 01:07:10,943
Well, bad luck that it was his father
who was disloyal, and not his mother.

570
01:07:11,027 --> 01:07:13,862
One presumably
doesn't have to report one's mother.

571
01:07:19,327 --> 01:07:22,413
- What?
- When will Pavel be back?

572
01:07:24,082 --> 01:07:27,126
- Mum?
- Never, stupid.

573
01:07:31,840 --> 01:07:34,341
It's Father. They've been bombed.

574
01:07:39,681 --> 01:07:41,432
Grandmother's dead.

575
01:08:26,686 --> 01:08:29,354
"...the victory
which You have obtained for us...

576
01:08:29,439 --> 01:08:31,732
and for all who sleep in Him...

577
01:08:31,816 --> 01:08:35,402
keep us who are still in the body
in everlasting fellowship...

578
01:08:35,487 --> 01:08:37,488
with all that wait for Thee on earth...

579
01:08:37,572 --> 01:08:40,324
and with all that are around Thee
in heaven...

580
01:08:40,408 --> 01:08:42,701
in union with Him
who is the resurrection...

581
01:08:42,786 --> 01:08:46,497
and the life, who liveth and reigneth
with Thee and the Holy Ghost...

582
01:08:46,581 --> 01:08:49,666
ever one God, world without end.
Amen."

583
01:08:49,751 --> 01:08:53,253
He can't have that on there.
She wouldn't have wanted it.

584
01:08:54,506 --> 01:08:56,256
He does.

585
01:09:23,993 --> 01:09:25,285
"Almighty God, who by the death of..."

586
01:09:25,370 --> 01:09:26,745
Have you ever been to a funeral?

587
01:09:28,665 --> 01:09:32,084
My grandma and grandpa both died
just after we got here...

588
01:09:32,168 --> 01:09:34,461
but there weren't any funerals.

589
01:09:36,881 --> 01:09:39,049
That one there to there.

590
01:09:42,303 --> 01:09:44,638
They both died at the same time?

591
01:09:45,139 --> 01:09:46,348
What of?

592
01:09:47,851 --> 01:09:48,934
I don't know.

593
01:09:49,018 --> 01:09:51,979
Papa said they must have caught
something on the way here.

594
01:09:52,981 --> 01:09:55,357
They had to go to a hospital
as soon as we arrived.

595
01:09:56,192 --> 01:09:58,235
We didn't see them again.

596
01:10:02,365 --> 01:10:03,824
This is fun.

597
01:10:04,868 --> 01:10:08,370
Wish we could do something
a bit more exciting, though.

598
01:10:12,375 --> 01:10:15,836
- That one there to there.
- This one?

599
01:10:17,922 --> 01:10:19,631
- This one?
- No, that one.

600
01:10:20,717 --> 01:10:23,427
- This one to here?
- No, there!

601
01:10:23,511 --> 01:10:25,637
- To here?
- No.

602
01:10:25,722 --> 01:10:27,848
- Here?
- No.

603
01:10:35,189 --> 01:10:40,527
- I don't want you to go away again.
- No. Neither do I.

604
01:11:08,806 --> 01:11:10,891
You can't behave like this!

605
01:11:11,601 --> 01:11:14,895
- You're questioning my behavior?
- It can't continue!

606
01:11:15,104 --> 01:11:17,898
I know.
I can't stand this anymore, Ralf.

607
01:11:17,982 --> 01:11:20,067
I can't stay here and be a part of this.

608
01:11:21,402 --> 01:11:23,195
Don't you think there will be questions?

609
01:11:23,279 --> 01:11:24,696
- Questions?
- Well, now, what does it say...

610
01:11:24,781 --> 01:11:29,493
about my ability to carry out my work
if I cannot control my own family?

611
01:11:29,577 --> 01:11:32,496
- Work? Is that what you call it?
- Pull yourself together, woman.

612
01:11:32,580 --> 01:11:34,331
Right. Just ignore it. Ignore it.

613
01:11:34,415 --> 01:11:38,126
Ignore the fact
that the man I married is a monster!

614
01:11:38,461 --> 01:11:41,088
Even your own mother
couldn't love you.

615
01:11:50,848 --> 01:11:52,599
Are you happy here?

616
01:11:54,018 --> 01:11:55,769
Yes. Very.

617
01:11:58,982 --> 01:12:00,607
And you, Gretel?

618
01:12:02,443 --> 01:12:08,115
Well, I was, but I do miss home.
I miss my friends.

619
01:12:08,616 --> 01:12:13,453
Yes, I'm sure. And you, too, Bruno.
You must miss those friends of yours.

620
01:12:14,622 --> 01:12:17,290
No. Not anymore, really.

621
01:12:29,053 --> 01:12:34,558
I suppose the real question is,
if the opportunity arose...

622
01:12:35,977 --> 01:12:38,270
would you prefer
to live somewhere else?

623
01:12:38,354 --> 01:12:42,232
- Back home?
- No. Not Berlin. Not yet.

624
01:12:42,817 --> 01:12:47,863
Somewhere safe, say Aunt Lottie's
in Heidelberg, for example.

625
01:12:49,157 --> 01:12:51,283
All of us? You as well?

626
01:12:52,493 --> 01:12:55,746
No. That won't be possible just yet,
I'm afraid.

627
01:12:55,830 --> 01:12:58,415
I must stay
and complete my work here.

628
01:13:00,835 --> 01:13:04,504
See, at the moment,
your mother is finding it-

629
01:13:06,716 --> 01:13:10,927
She just feels right now you need
to spend some time elsewhere.

630
01:13:11,012 --> 01:13:12,846
Would you like that?

631
01:13:22,857 --> 01:13:28,320
I'm afraid, Bruno, in life, we often
have to do things we don't want to do.

632
01:13:28,404 --> 01:13:31,114
The important thing is
your mother does not feel...

633
01:13:31,199 --> 01:13:34,034
that this is an appropriate place for you
to be spending your childhood...

634
01:13:34,118 --> 01:13:37,788
and the more I think about it, the more
I realize she's very probably right.

635
01:13:37,872 --> 01:13:39,581
- But, Dad-
- No!

636
01:13:46,422 --> 01:13:48,715
It's time for you to move away.

637
01:14:13,908 --> 01:14:15,867
Is everything all right?

638
01:14:18,830 --> 01:14:20,705
We can't find Papa.

639
01:14:20,790 --> 01:14:23,416
He went on a different work duty
with some of the men...

640
01:14:23,501 --> 01:14:25,544
and they haven't come back.

641
01:14:34,762 --> 01:14:38,431
I've got some bad news, too.
I'm going away.

642
01:14:40,184 --> 01:14:42,102
How long for this time?

643
01:14:42,603 --> 01:14:46,106
That's why it's bad. It's forever, I think.

644
01:14:47,191 --> 01:14:51,528
Mum says this is no place for children,
which is just stupid.

645
01:14:52,029 --> 01:14:55,198
- When do you go?
- Tomorrow. After lunch.

646
01:14:56,325 --> 01:15:01,121
So, I won't ever see you again?

647
01:15:02,999 --> 01:15:07,085
Yes, you will. You can come on holiday
to Berlin ifyou like...

648
01:15:07,170 --> 01:15:10,589
when everybody's getting on
with each other again.

649
01:15:15,219 --> 01:15:17,679
I wish I could've helped you
find your dad.

650
01:15:18,723 --> 01:15:22,184
I really want to make up
for letting you down like I did.

651
01:15:22,310 --> 01:15:25,270
That would have done it, wouldn't it?
Helping you find your dad?

652
01:15:25,354 --> 01:15:28,190
Would've been great.
Like a secret mission.

653
01:15:33,070 --> 01:15:36,406
- I could dig under.
- What? With that?

654
01:15:36,490 --> 01:15:40,160
- No, but I could bring something.
- You don't want to come over here.

655
01:15:44,248 --> 01:15:45,332
Look.

656
01:15:51,923 --> 01:15:55,258
- I could come through to your side.
- What's the point in that?

657
01:15:55,343 --> 01:15:58,178
Your dad's not going to be over here,
is he?

658
01:15:58,763 --> 01:16:02,766
But I'd stick out though, wouldn't I,
if I came through?

659
01:16:02,850 --> 01:16:04,726
I don't look like you.

660
01:16:08,439 --> 01:16:10,523
You could look like me, though.

661
01:16:10,608 --> 01:16:12,943
If you dressed like me
and shaved your hair off.

662
01:16:13,027 --> 01:16:15,111
I'm not shaving my hair off.

663
01:16:15,196 --> 01:16:19,616
- You could cover it with a cap.
- My pajamas are a different color.

664
01:16:19,700 --> 01:16:23,245
I could bring some.
There's a hut full of them...

665
01:16:23,329 --> 01:16:26,081
thousands of them.
Would you do it, though?

666
01:16:26,165 --> 01:16:28,583
- I want to do it.
- Would you dare do it, though?

667
01:16:28,668 --> 01:16:31,127
- I want to help you find your dad.
- I've got to go.

668
01:16:31,212 --> 01:16:34,631
Tomorrow, then?
I'll bring an extra-big sandwich.

669
01:16:34,715 --> 01:16:36,883
And don't forget the pajamas!

670
01:17:39,905 --> 01:17:41,072
Bruno?

671
01:17:41,782 --> 01:17:45,618
Mum, can I go and play on the swing?

672
01:17:46,996 --> 01:17:49,748
- Bruno...
- It's my last chance.

673
01:17:52,168 --> 01:17:53,793
All right. Go on then.

674
01:18:25,117 --> 01:18:29,329
- I thought you weren't coming!
- I'm sorry. It wasn't easy to get away.

675
01:18:29,455 --> 01:18:33,124
I'm not meant to be out here today.
You forgot the pajamas!

676
01:18:34,960 --> 01:18:38,129
- Did you bring the sandwich?
- Would I let you down?

677
01:19:03,030 --> 01:19:04,239
Shmuel.

678
01:19:13,040 --> 01:19:14,165
Here.

679
01:19:29,932 --> 01:19:31,433
How do I look?

680
01:19:38,774 --> 01:19:40,733
Right. Let's get going.

681
01:19:57,042 --> 01:19:58,209
Bruno?

682
01:19:59,587 --> 01:20:01,087
That's enough.

683
01:20:31,327 --> 01:20:33,119
Let's go and find your dad.

684
01:20:38,834 --> 01:20:40,084
Come on!

685
01:20:40,586 --> 01:20:42,170
Master Bruno?

686
01:21:26,966 --> 01:21:28,174
Shmuel.

687
01:21:29,468 --> 01:21:32,303
- Can we go to the café or something?
- Café?

688
01:21:35,474 --> 01:21:38,643
- Maybe I should go home.
- What about Papa?

689
01:21:48,195 --> 01:21:49,320
Yeah.

690
01:21:52,825 --> 01:21:55,034
We'll check our hut first.

691
01:21:58,706 --> 01:22:00,248
Bruno?

692
01:22:07,673 --> 01:22:08,881
Come on.

693
01:22:22,229 --> 01:22:23,021
Papa?

694
01:22:25,733 --> 01:22:27,859
Up! Up! Get up!

695
01:22:27,943 --> 01:22:29,986
- What's happening?
- I don't know.

696
01:22:30,070 --> 01:22:31,821
We go on marches sometimes.

697
01:22:31,905 --> 01:22:33,906
Move! Up, up!

698
01:22:36,076 --> 01:22:37,869
Move, move!

699
01:22:48,589 --> 01:22:50,256
Bruno!

700
01:22:51,216 --> 01:22:54,260
He must still be
outside somewhere, ma'am.

701
01:23:08,150 --> 01:23:09,776
Bruno!

702
01:23:12,529 --> 01:23:13,780
Bruno?

703
01:23:25,334 --> 01:23:27,418
- Move!
- Quickly!

704
01:23:30,422 --> 01:23:31,798
Get up!

705
01:23:34,343 --> 01:23:36,135
Get up. You must!

706
01:23:37,304 --> 01:23:38,763
Move them out!

707
01:23:50,442 --> 01:23:52,694
...which means that
our weekly capabilities...

708
01:23:52,778 --> 01:23:54,278
would be almost tripled...

709
01:23:54,363 --> 01:23:56,614
so, therefore,
by the end of the summer...

710
01:23:56,699 --> 01:23:59,826
- Ralf.
- Elsa, I'm in a meeting.

711
01:24:00,452 --> 01:24:01,494
Bruno's missing.

712
01:24:07,793 --> 01:24:09,127
Come on!

713
01:24:15,801 --> 01:24:17,468
Wait here!

714
01:24:28,313 --> 01:24:29,647
Come on!

715
01:24:32,526 --> 01:24:33,860
Move! Move!

716
01:24:41,869 --> 01:24:43,494
Join the queue!

717
01:24:51,670 --> 01:24:53,212
Come on, you!

718
01:25:02,222 --> 01:25:03,765
Bruno!

719
01:25:04,433 --> 01:25:06,058
Move it!

720
01:25:08,729 --> 01:25:10,229
Go on.

721
01:25:11,815 --> 01:25:13,357
Bruno!

722
01:25:22,951 --> 01:25:27,830
It's all right. I think we're just waiting
in here until the rain stops.

723
01:25:27,915 --> 01:25:29,290
Clothes off!

724
01:25:37,466 --> 01:25:39,467
Where are we going?

725
01:25:44,056 --> 01:25:45,640
No, it's just a shower.

726
01:25:47,434 --> 01:25:49,310
A shower?

727
01:26:37,985 --> 01:26:40,653
Open the gates! Open the gates!

728
01:26:44,324 --> 01:26:45,449
Move!

729
01:28:03,654 --> 01:28:05,363
Bruno!

1
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:53,620
Five.

2
00:07:53,699 --> 00:07:54,961
Oh, great.

3
00:07:55,033 --> 00:07:57,934
You got an arrow
right in your chest.

4
00:07:58,003 --> 00:07:59,937
Don't worry.
I got resurrection.

5
00:08:00,005 --> 00:08:01,404
I'm
already undead.

6
00:08:01,473 --> 00:08:03,873
I can
still throw

7
00:08:03,942 --> 00:08:05,773
Just trying
to help you.

8
00:08:05,844 --> 00:08:08,312
Throw a spell
over the pizza man.

9
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:09,745
Where's our pizza,
man?

10
00:08:09,815 --> 00:08:12,147
I'm ready to...
now to play.

11
00:08:12,217 --> 00:08:14,708
I'm ready
to play now, guys.

12
00:08:14,786 --> 00:08:16,185
We're in the middle,
Elliott.

13
00:08:16,255 --> 00:08:18,519
You can't join
in the middle.

14
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:19,989
I got him!

15
00:08:20,058 --> 00:08:21,992
What am
I asking for?

16
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:23,493
<i>Papa oom mow mow.</i>

17
00:08:23,562 --> 00:08:25,996
<i>O.K.
Papa oom mow mow.</i>

18
00:08:26,064 --> 00:08:27,190
Mike?

19
00:08:27,266 --> 00:08:28,756
It's for his mother.

20
00:08:30,068 --> 00:08:31,797
Mike?

21
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:33,804
Ask Steve.
He's game master.

22
00:08:33,872 --> 00:08:36,136
He has
absolute power.

23
00:08:36,208 --> 00:08:37,505
Steve?

24
00:08:37,576 --> 00:08:39,567
Steve, can
I play now?

25
00:08:39,645 --> 00:08:42,045
Go wait for
the pizza first.

26
00:08:42,114 --> 00:08:43,206
Then I'm in?

27
00:08:43,282 --> 00:08:44,374
You're in.

28
00:08:44,449 --> 00:08:45,677
Figure out
your strategy.

29
00:08:45,751 --> 00:08:47,116
You're playing
after Greg.

30
00:08:47,185 --> 00:08:50,052
Plenty of sausage
and pepperonis.

31
00:08:50,122 --> 00:08:52,454
Everything
but the little fishies.

32
00:09:10,475 --> 00:09:11,669
Oops.

33
00:09:21,353 --> 00:09:22,911
<i># Apapa oom
mow mow mow #</i>

34
00:09:22,988 --> 00:09:24,421
<i># Papa oom
mow mow #</i>

35
00:09:26,825 --> 00:09:29,419
Harvey?

36
00:09:29,494 --> 00:09:31,587
Harvey,
is that you, boy?

37
00:09:31,663 --> 00:09:34,257
<i># I hear that sound
everywhere I go #</i>

38
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:35,630
<i># Papa oom

39
00:09:35,701 --> 00:09:37,430
<i># Apapa oom
mow mow mow #</i>

40
00:09:37,502 --> 00:09:38,969
Over here,
you guys.

41
00:09:39,037 --> 00:09:40,095
Stop it.

42
00:09:40,172 --> 00:09:41,434
Sorry.

43
00:09:41,873 --> 00:09:43,135
<i># Papa oom
mow mow... ##</i>

44
00:09:49,514 --> 00:09:51,209
Harvey?

45
00:10:32,624 --> 00:10:35,058
All's you get
is those 40-year-olds.

46
00:10:35,127 --> 00:10:37,357
How do you
win this game?

47
00:10:37,429 --> 00:10:38,896
It's like life.

48
00:10:38,964 --> 00:10:40,693
You don't win at life.

49
00:10:40,766 --> 00:10:42,734
Mom! There's
something out...

50
00:10:42,801 --> 00:10:44,200
Where's the pizza?

51
00:10:44,269 --> 00:10:45,702
There's something
out there!

52
00:10:45,771 --> 00:10:47,136
In the tool shed.

53
00:10:47,205 --> 00:10:49,639
It threw
the ball at me.

54
00:10:49,708 --> 00:10:51,471
Quiet!

55
00:10:51,543 --> 00:10:53,568
Nobody
go out there.

56
00:10:57,382 --> 00:11:00,146
Stop. Now, you guys
stay right here.

57
00:11:00,218 --> 00:11:01,651
You stay here, Mom.

58
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,153
We'll check it out.

59
00:11:03,221 --> 00:11:05,451
And put
those knives back!

60
00:11:06,558 --> 00:11:07,991
It's OK, Elliott.

61
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:10,790
Let's go
get the flashlight.

62
00:11:12,097 --> 00:11:13,496
Hold it.

63
00:11:13,565 --> 00:11:14,998
Wait a minute.

64
00:11:15,067 --> 00:11:17,365
Ooh, creep...
Creepy.

65
00:11:17,436 --> 00:11:19,336
What exactly
did you see?

66
00:11:19,404 --> 00:11:20,632
In there.

67
00:11:20,706 --> 00:11:22,731
Woo... ha!

68
00:11:24,242 --> 00:11:25,709
It's scary.

69
00:11:28,113 --> 00:11:29,842
Woo!

70
00:11:29,915 --> 00:11:31,382
There's
nothing in here.

71
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:33,384
The gate's open.

72
00:11:33,452 --> 00:11:34,942
Look at these.

73
00:11:39,858 --> 00:11:42,793
Coyote's come
back again, Mom.

74
00:11:42,861 --> 00:11:44,260
OK, party's over.

75
00:11:44,329 --> 00:11:45,762
Everybody
back inside now.

76
00:11:45,831 --> 00:11:47,230
Get out.
Hurry up.

77
00:11:47,299 --> 00:11:48,698
Quick. Hurry up.

78
00:11:48,767 --> 00:11:50,792
Tyler, give me
that knife.

79
00:11:52,471 --> 00:11:53,529
Oh, great.

80
00:11:53,605 --> 00:11:55,038
Nice one,
Elliott.

81
00:11:55,107 --> 00:11:56,540
It was an accident.

82
00:11:56,608 --> 00:11:59,873
Who said you guys
could order a pizza?

83
00:11:59,945 --> 00:12:01,378
Uh... him.

84
00:12:01,446 --> 00:12:03,414
Huh? In
the house.

85
00:12:03,482 --> 00:12:05,040
You geek, man.

86
00:12:05,117 --> 00:12:06,550
Mom, it was real.

87
00:12:06,618 --> 00:12:07,744
Douche bag.

88
00:12:07,819 --> 00:12:10,617
No douche bag talk
in my house.

89
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,912
Elliott, you're crazy.

90
00:13:39,077 --> 00:13:40,635
Runff.

91
00:13:40,712 --> 00:13:41,940
Runff.

92
00:14:09,474 --> 00:14:12,466
Aarh!

93
00:14:12,544 --> 00:14:15,138
Aah!

94
00:14:15,213 --> 00:14:17,773
Aah!
Aarh!

95
00:14:17,849 --> 00:14:19,476
Aarh!
Aah!

96
00:15:24,482 --> 00:15:25,915
Hello.

97
00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:39,490
Hello?

98
00:16:30,181 --> 00:16:33,548
What are you going as
for Halloween?

99
00:16:33,618 --> 00:16:35,882
I'm not going
to stupid Halloween.

100
00:16:35,954 --> 00:16:37,751
Go as a goblin.

101
00:16:37,822 --> 00:16:39,380
Shut up.

102
00:16:39,457 --> 00:16:42,255
It's not
that we don't

103
00:16:42,327 --> 00:16:43,885
Well, it was real.

104
00:16:43,962 --> 00:16:47,398
What are
you going as, Gert?

105
00:16:47,465 --> 00:16:50,593
I'm going
as a cowgirl.

106
00:16:50,668 --> 00:16:53,102
So what else
is new?

107
00:16:53,171 --> 00:16:55,264
Maybe it was
an iguana.

108
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:56,932
It was no iguana.

109
00:16:57,008 --> 00:16:58,032
Maybe a...

110
00:16:58,109 --> 00:16:59,940
You know
how they say

111
00:17:00,011 --> 00:17:02,172
there are alligators
in the sewers?

112
00:17:02,247 --> 00:17:04,238
Alligators
in the sewers.

113
00:17:04,315 --> 00:17:06,579
All we're
trying to say is

114
00:17:06,651 --> 00:17:08,118
maybe
you imagined it.

115
00:17:08,186 --> 00:17:09,585
I couldn't have.

116
00:17:09,654 --> 00:17:11,246
Maybe
a deformed kid.

117
00:17:11,322 --> 00:17:13,483
A deformed kid.

118
00:17:13,558 --> 00:17:16,186
Maybe an elf
or leprechaun.

119
00:17:16,261 --> 00:17:18,286
It wasn't that,
penis breath!

120
00:17:18,363 --> 00:17:20,058
Elliott!

121
00:17:20,131 --> 00:17:21,860
Sit down.

122
00:17:23,835 --> 00:17:24,767
Ahem.

123
00:17:24,836 --> 00:17:27,464
Dad would believe me.

124
00:17:30,675 --> 00:17:33,439
Maybe you ought
to call your father

125
00:17:33,511 --> 00:17:35,479
and tell him
about it.

126
00:17:35,547 --> 00:17:36,775
I can't.

127
00:17:36,848 --> 00:17:38,873
He's in Mexico
with Sally.

128
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:52,352
Wh-Where's Mexico?

129
00:17:55,533 --> 00:17:56,795
Excuse me.

130
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:04,204
I'm going
to kill you.

131
00:18:04,275 --> 00:18:07,108
If you see it again,
whatever it is,

132
00:18:07,178 --> 00:18:09,112
don't touch it.
Just call me.

133
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:12,013
We'll have somebody
take it away.

134
00:18:12,083 --> 00:18:15,052
Like the dogcatcher?

135
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,951
They'll give it
a lobotomy

136
00:18:17,021 --> 00:18:20,047
or do experiments on it
or something.

137
00:18:20,125 --> 00:18:22,650
Your turn
to do the dishes.

138
00:18:22,727 --> 00:18:24,194
I set and cleared.

139
00:18:24,262 --> 00:18:25,194
I did.

140
00:18:25,263 --> 00:18:26,662
I did breakfast.

141
00:18:26,731 --> 00:18:28,289
I did breakfast.

142
00:18:31,169 --> 00:18:32,761
What's the matter, Mom?

143
00:18:35,707 --> 00:18:37,572
He hates Mexico.

144
00:18:38,576 --> 00:18:39,474
Damn it!

145
00:18:39,544 --> 00:18:41,307
Why don't you
grow up?

146
00:18:41,379 --> 00:18:44,439
Think how
other people feel

147
00:19:37,635 --> 00:19:38,932
Ahhr...

148
00:19:56,554 --> 00:19:57,646
Ma...

149
00:19:57,722 --> 00:19:59,053
Mom.

150
00:19:59,123 --> 00:20:00,055
Mom.

151
00:20:00,124 --> 00:20:01,113
Michael.

152
00:20:06,497 --> 00:20:07,623
Michael.

153
00:20:07,699 --> 00:20:08,688
Mom.

154
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:10,944
Ahhr.

155
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:04,203
Wow.

156
00:25:26,384 --> 00:25:28,318
OK, you're hot.

157
00:25:28,386 --> 00:25:29,910
I'll be back.

158
00:25:32,890 --> 00:25:35,450
Mary, can I
back the car out?

159
00:25:35,526 --> 00:25:37,858
Not 1 foot past
the driveway.

160
00:26:34,018 --> 00:26:36,316
You were
outside last night

161
00:26:36,387 --> 00:26:38,855
waiting
for that thing,

162
00:26:40,324 --> 00:26:43,350
Going to live
if I go to work?

163
00:26:46,364 --> 00:26:48,298
O.K.

164
00:26:48,366 --> 00:26:49,856
No TV.

165
00:26:58,976 --> 00:27:00,739
Come on.

166
00:27:00,811 --> 00:27:02,779
Mommy, look
what Michael did.

167
00:27:02,847 --> 00:27:03,905
This and...

168
00:27:03,981 --> 00:27:05,414
I see them, Gert,

169
00:27:05,483 --> 00:27:08,145
and when I catch him,
I'll catch him.

170
00:27:10,354 --> 00:27:13,448
Come on.
Don't be afraid.

171
00:27:13,524 --> 00:27:16,618
It's all right.
Come on.

172
00:27:16,694 --> 00:27:18,628
Come on.

173
00:27:22,867 --> 00:27:24,357
Come on.

174
00:27:25,836 --> 00:27:27,201
Come on.

175
00:27:28,205 --> 00:27:30,469
Come on.

176
00:27:30,541 --> 00:27:31,769
Come on.

177
00:27:39,817 --> 00:27:41,546
Do you talk?

178
00:27:41,619 --> 00:27:43,678
You know, talk?

179
00:27:45,289 --> 00:27:48,258
Me human.

180
00:27:48,325 --> 00:27:49,257
Boy.

181
00:27:49,326 --> 00:27:50,987
Elliott.

182
00:27:52,363 --> 00:27:55,025
Ell-i-ott.

183
00:27:55,099 --> 00:27:57,226
Elliott.

184
00:28:08,679 --> 00:28:11,910
Coke. See,
we drink it.

185
00:28:11,982 --> 00:28:13,916
It's, uh...
It's a drink.

186
00:28:13,984 --> 00:28:15,383
You know, food?

187
00:28:16,387 --> 00:28:18,787
These are toys.
Little men.

188
00:28:18,856 --> 00:28:21,188
This is Greedo.

189
00:28:21,258 --> 00:28:24,887
And then this
is Hammerhead.

190
00:28:24,962 --> 00:28:28,193
You see,
this is Walrus Man.

191
00:28:28,265 --> 00:28:31,530
And then this
is Snaggletooth.

192
00:28:31,602 --> 00:28:34,230
And this is
Lando Calrissian.

193
00:28:34,305 --> 00:28:35,465
See?

194
00:28:35,539 --> 00:28:38,633
And this
is Boba Fett.

195
00:28:38,709 --> 00:28:41,371
Look. They
can even have wars.

196
00:28:41,445 --> 00:28:44,005
Pffz!
Plzzaz! Plzzaz!

197
00:28:44,081 --> 00:28:45,981
Aah.

198
00:28:46,050 --> 00:28:48,678
And look. Fish.

199
00:28:48,753 --> 00:28:51,313
The fish
eat the fish food,

200
00:28:51,388 --> 00:28:53,720
and the shark
eats the fish,

201
00:28:53,791 --> 00:28:56,919
but nobody
eats a shark.

202
00:28:58,629 --> 00:29:02,861
See, this is Pez.
Candy.

203
00:29:02,933 --> 00:29:04,833
You see, you eat it.

204
00:29:04,902 --> 00:29:07,370
You put the candy
in here,

205
00:29:07,438 --> 00:29:10,032
and when you
lift the head,

206
00:29:10,107 --> 00:29:11,472
the candy comes out.

207
00:29:11,542 --> 00:29:13,009
You want some?

208
00:29:16,247 --> 00:29:17,737
This is a peanut.

209
00:29:17,815 --> 00:29:19,339
You eat it.

210
00:29:19,416 --> 00:29:21,884
But you
can't eat this one

211
00:29:21,952 --> 00:29:23,886
'cause this is fake.

212
00:29:23,954 --> 00:29:26,218
This is money.
You see?

213
00:29:26,290 --> 00:29:29,225
We put the money
in the peanut.

214
00:29:29,293 --> 00:29:31,193
You see? Bank.

215
00:29:31,262 --> 00:29:32,456
And then...

216
00:29:34,298 --> 00:29:35,697
This is a car.

217
00:29:35,766 --> 00:29:38,826
This is what
we get around in.

218
00:29:38,903 --> 00:29:41,428
See? A car.

219
00:29:44,141 --> 00:29:45,369
Hey!

220
00:29:45,442 --> 00:29:47,774
Hey,
wait a second.

221
00:29:47,845 --> 00:29:51,042
No. You don't
eat them.

222
00:29:51,115 --> 00:29:52,582
Are you hungry?

223
00:29:52,650 --> 00:29:55,278
I'm hungry.

224
00:29:58,789 --> 00:30:00,518
Stay.

225
00:30:04,128 --> 00:30:05,322
Stay.

226
00:30:05,396 --> 00:30:07,387
I'll be right here.

227
00:30:07,464 --> 00:30:11,366
OK? I'll be
right here.

228
00:30:11,435 --> 00:30:12,459
Harv!

229
00:30:12,536 --> 00:30:13,969
Aahr!

230
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:17,735
Aahr!

231
00:30:18,843 --> 00:30:20,834
Come on, Harvey.

232
00:30:26,851 --> 00:30:28,341
He'll like this.

233
00:30:35,426 --> 00:30:37,121
This.

234
00:30:38,963 --> 00:30:40,294
This.

235
00:30:41,932 --> 00:30:42,990
Aah!

236
00:30:43,067 --> 00:30:45,399
Aahr!

237
00:31:08,092 --> 00:31:09,616
Are you OK?

238
00:31:13,297 --> 00:31:15,060
Too much
excitement, huh?

239
00:31:15,132 --> 00:31:17,191
Want a Coke?

240
00:31:20,604 --> 00:31:22,663
Thirty-five pounds.

241
00:31:23,807 --> 00:31:27,800
Thirty-five pounds!
You're so fat!

242
00:31:32,750 --> 00:31:34,741
I wonder how tall you are.

243
00:31:35,719 --> 00:31:37,584
I'm four-six.

244
00:31:37,655 --> 00:31:40,249
You must be around

245
00:31:40,324 --> 00:31:42,315
three...

246
00:31:55,139 --> 00:31:57,733
This is where the water
comes from. See?

247
00:31:59,476 --> 00:32:01,410
This is hot and this is cold.

248
00:32:01,478 --> 00:32:04,242
Now, it all comes
from a big water tower.

249
00:32:04,315 --> 00:32:06,909
It goes through pipes
and sometimes

250
00:32:06,984 --> 00:32:10,920
dead bugs come through
and land in the bath.

251
00:32:10,988 --> 00:32:13,684
It's real sick.
Anyway, look...

252
00:32:17,928 --> 00:32:20,658
Are you thirsty?

253
00:32:20,731 --> 00:32:21,755
Aarh!

254
00:32:21,832 --> 00:32:23,561
Aah!

255
00:32:27,538 --> 00:32:28,698
I'll get it.

256
00:32:31,208 --> 00:32:34,336
Hi. Yeah, I'm fine.

257
00:32:34,411 --> 00:32:37,539
Sure. Yeah, I still got a fever.

258
00:32:37,614 --> 00:32:41,050
Yeah. Uh, no, get back.

259
00:32:41,118 --> 00:32:43,313
I'm fine, Mom. Yeah.

260
00:32:45,356 --> 00:32:47,620
Yeah.

261
00:32:47,691 --> 00:32:50,489
No. Mom, I gotta get in bed now.

262
00:32:50,561 --> 00:32:52,552
Okay. Goodbye.

263
00:32:53,731 --> 00:32:56,063
Mom, I'm sick.

264
00:32:56,133 --> 00:32:58,067
Mom, I don't need to go
to the doctor!

265
00:33:00,704 --> 00:33:05,607
Mom, I only had a fever
of 99 today.

266
00:33:05,676 --> 00:33:07,075
Okay, "and a half."

267
00:33:07,144 --> 00:33:10,978
Uh-huh. Okay, Mom.
Okay, bye.

268
00:33:13,083 --> 00:33:15,881
I've got to throw up.
Mom, please.

269
00:33:15,953 --> 00:33:19,980
I'm gonna throw up on the phone
if you don't let me go.

270
00:33:22,693 --> 00:33:24,320
Mom, I've gotta throw up now.

271
00:33:24,395 --> 00:33:26,590
Yeah, uh...

272
00:33:28,132 --> 00:33:30,760
Uhhh!

273
00:33:37,641 --> 00:33:39,666
You could drown in stuff
like this.

274
00:33:51,321 --> 00:33:53,619
Is this your idea
of a good time?

275
00:33:57,461 --> 00:33:58,894
# Accidents
will happen #

276
00:33:58,962 --> 00:34:01,021
# But it's only
hit-and-run #

277
00:34:01,098 --> 00:34:05,034
# There are
so many people to see #

278
00:34:05,102 --> 00:34:07,866
# So many people
you can check upon #

279
00:34:07,938 --> 00:34:09,701
# And add
to your collection #

280
00:34:09,773 --> 00:34:12,298
# But they
keep you hanging on #

281
00:34:12,376 --> 00:34:14,640
# Nothin' but health shit #

282
00:34:14,711 --> 00:34:17,976
# And add
to your collection #

283
00:34:18,048 --> 00:34:20,812
# But they
keep you hanging on #

284
00:34:20,884 --> 00:34:22,749
# Accidents
will happen #

285
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:24,583
# But it's only
hit-and-run #

286
00:34:24,655 --> 00:34:26,418
# You'll be
a victim of... ##

287
00:34:26,490 --> 00:34:27,923
Mike, come in.

288
00:34:27,991 --> 00:34:29,390
How you feeling,
faker?

289
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:31,394
I got something
really important...

290
00:34:31,462 --> 00:34:35,296
Tyler said he got 69,000
on Asteroids yesterday.

291
00:34:35,365 --> 00:34:37,390
Look, remember
the goblin?

292
00:34:37,468 --> 00:34:39,197
You're so lame,
Elliott.

293
00:34:39,269 --> 00:34:41,396
Come on, Michael.
He came back.

294
00:34:41,472 --> 00:34:44,305
He came back?

295
00:34:44,374 --> 00:34:46,308
He came back?

296
00:34:46,376 --> 00:34:48,003
Oh, my God!

297
00:34:48,078 --> 00:34:50,012
One thing.

298
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:52,310
I have
absolute power.

299
00:34:52,382 --> 00:34:54,009
Say it.

300
00:34:54,084 --> 00:34:55,551
What have you got?

301
00:34:55,619 --> 00:34:56,984
Is it the coyote?

302
00:34:57,054 --> 00:34:59,249
No. Look...

303
00:35:00,757 --> 00:35:02,486
O.K. Now, swear it...

304
00:35:02,559 --> 00:35:06,325
The most excellent
promise you can make.

305
00:35:06,396 --> 00:35:10,355
Swear as my only brother
on our lives.

306
00:35:10,434 --> 00:35:12,868
Don't get so heavy.
I swear.

307
00:35:12,936 --> 00:35:15,496
O.K. Stand over there.

308
00:35:15,572 --> 00:35:18,473
You'd better take off
your shoulder pads.

309
00:35:18,542 --> 00:35:19,975
You might scare him.

310
00:35:20,043 --> 00:35:22,273
And close your eyes.

311
00:35:22,346 --> 00:35:23,779
Don't push it, Elliott.

312
00:35:23,847 --> 00:35:25,280
I'm not
coming out there

313
00:35:25,349 --> 00:35:27,317
until your eyes
are closed.

314
00:35:27,384 --> 00:35:29,477
O.K. They're closed.

315
00:35:29,553 --> 00:35:31,987
Mom is going
to kill you.

316
00:35:32,055 --> 00:35:33,955
Aah! Ohh! Ooh!

317
00:35:34,024 --> 00:35:37,425
O.K. Swear it
one more time.

318
00:35:37,494 --> 00:35:41,225
You have absolute
power. Eerrp!

319
00:35:52,042 --> 00:35:55,569
Elliott! Look what
I made for you!

320
00:35:56,713 --> 00:35:57,839
Aahr!

321
00:35:57,915 --> 00:35:59,780
Aah!

322
00:35:59,850 --> 00:36:02,910
Aahr!
Aah!

323
00:36:04,087 --> 00:36:05,520
Stop!

324
00:36:05,589 --> 00:36:06,715
Aahr!

325
00:36:06,790 --> 00:36:08,417
Aah!

326
00:36:08,492 --> 00:36:10,687
Aah!

327
00:36:10,761 --> 00:36:11,921
Mmm!

328
00:36:11,995 --> 00:36:13,587
Kids, I'm home!

329
00:36:13,664 --> 00:36:14,995
Guys?

330
00:36:15,065 --> 00:36:16,430
In the closet, fast.

331
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:17,967
Anybody up there,
kids?

332
00:36:18,035 --> 00:36:19,730
Aah!

333
00:36:19,803 --> 00:36:20,929
Aahr!

334
00:36:21,004 --> 00:36:22,631
Anybody home?

335
00:36:22,706 --> 00:36:24,936
Hi, honey,
how do you fee...

336
00:36:25,008 --> 00:36:27,033
What happened
in here?

337
00:36:28,512 --> 00:36:30,537
Oh, you mean my room.

338
00:36:32,382 --> 00:36:34,316
This is no room.

339
00:36:34,384 --> 00:36:35,976
This is an accident.

340
00:36:36,053 --> 00:36:37,452
I was, um...

341
00:36:37,521 --> 00:36:38,818
reorganizing.

342
00:36:38,889 --> 00:36:40,322
I can see that.

343
00:36:40,390 --> 00:36:43,359
Put those shelves
back on the wall.

344
00:36:43,427 --> 00:36:46,362
Get the toys
off the floor.

345
00:36:46,430 --> 00:36:47,863
Make your bed.

346
00:36:47,931 --> 00:36:49,831
You're feeling better,
I see.

347
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:52,266
You guys watch
Gertie for me

348
00:36:52,336 --> 00:36:54,827
while I take a shower.

349
00:36:54,905 --> 00:36:56,065
Absolutely.

350
00:36:57,541 --> 00:36:58,735
Bye, Mom.

351
00:36:59,876 --> 00:37:01,400
Whew!

352
00:37:07,384 --> 00:37:09,409
Uhhh.

353
00:37:09,486 --> 00:37:10,919
Elliott...

354
00:37:10,988 --> 00:37:13,013
I'm keeping him.

355
00:37:13,090 --> 00:37:14,887
Ahhr...

356
00:37:14,958 --> 00:37:16,619
What is it?

357
00:37:17,995 --> 00:37:20,623
He won't hurt you,
Gertie.

358
00:37:20,697 --> 00:37:24,155
He won't hurt you,
Gertie.

359
00:37:24,234 --> 00:37:26,202
We're not going
to hurt you.

360
00:37:26,270 --> 00:37:29,296
Is he a boy or a girl?

361
00:37:29,373 --> 00:37:30,965
He's a boy.

362
00:37:34,177 --> 00:37:37,078
Was he wearing
any clothes?

363
00:37:37,147 --> 00:37:38,614
No.

364
00:37:38,682 --> 00:37:40,582
But, look...

365
00:37:40,651 --> 00:37:44,109
you can't tell.
Not even Mom.

366
00:37:44,187 --> 00:37:45,415
Why not?

367
00:37:45,489 --> 00:37:48,515
Because, um...
grownups can't see him.

368
00:37:49,526 --> 00:37:52,393
Only little kids
can see him.

369
00:37:52,462 --> 00:37:54,089
Give me a break.

370
00:37:54,164 --> 00:37:57,463
Well, do you know
what's going to happen

371
00:37:57,534 --> 00:37:59,593
if you do tell?

372
00:38:02,506 --> 00:38:04,440
Do it, Mike.
We have to.

373
00:38:04,508 --> 00:38:05,941
Oh, no, please!

374
00:38:06,009 --> 00:38:08,637
Don't do anything,
please!

375
00:38:08,712 --> 00:38:10,043
Help me!

376
00:38:10,113 --> 00:38:11,603
No, please!

377
00:38:11,682 --> 00:38:12,614
Give it!

378
00:38:12,683 --> 00:38:13,672
Promise?

379
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:14,739
Yes.

380
00:38:14,818 --> 00:38:16,342
Do you promise?

381
00:38:43,847 --> 00:38:45,712
Runff.

382
00:38:45,782 --> 00:38:47,113
Runff.

383
00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:28,890
What are you
doing, Gert?

384
00:39:28,959 --> 00:39:32,895
I'm going to play
in Elliott's room.

385
00:39:32,963 --> 00:39:35,295
O.K. Don't let him
torture you.

386
00:39:35,365 --> 00:39:36,764
I won't, Mary.

387
00:39:43,206 --> 00:39:44,195
Hello?

388
00:39:44,274 --> 00:39:45,468
Ahhr...

389
00:39:45,542 --> 00:39:47,373
Jer-Jerry!

390
00:39:53,016 --> 00:39:55,484
Come on, come on.
Hurry up.

391
00:39:55,552 --> 00:39:58,749
Don't be pushy,
pushy.

392
00:40:02,225 --> 00:40:03,749
A plant for you.

393
00:40:03,827 --> 00:40:05,226
Maybe he's some animal

394
00:40:05,295 --> 00:40:07,286
that wasn't
supposed to live.

395
00:40:07,364 --> 00:40:08,797
I brought
some clay...

396
00:40:08,865 --> 00:40:10,833
Like those
rabbits we saw.

397
00:40:10,901 --> 00:40:11,833
Green, orange...

398
00:40:11,902 --> 00:40:13,335
Could be a monkey.

399
00:40:13,403 --> 00:40:14,563
A bald monkey?

400
00:40:14,638 --> 00:40:17,664
Is he a pig? He
sure eats like one.

401
00:40:17,741 --> 00:40:19,231
You could
make faces.

402
00:40:19,309 --> 00:40:23,405
And make them
mean... and happy

403
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:25,948
and make them
get sharp teeth...

404
00:40:26,016 --> 00:40:27,813
We are here.

405
00:40:27,884 --> 00:40:28,908
We're here.

406
00:40:28,985 --> 00:40:30,145
Use this.

407
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:33,121
You could make
all sorts of things.

408
00:40:33,190 --> 00:40:35,488
O.K. We're here.

409
00:40:35,559 --> 00:40:37,390
We are here.

410
00:40:37,461 --> 00:40:39,258
Where are you from?

411
00:40:39,329 --> 00:40:40,853
Ahhr...

412
00:40:52,242 --> 00:40:54,176
I don't like his feet.

413
00:40:54,244 --> 00:40:56,678
They're only feet,
you little twerp.

414
00:40:56,746 --> 00:40:59,476
He's trying
to tell us something.

415
00:41:08,458 --> 00:41:09,618
Earth.

416
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:12,125
Home.

417
00:41:13,263 --> 00:41:14,389
Home.

418
00:41:15,365 --> 00:41:16,593
Home.

419
00:41:53,436 --> 00:41:55,028
What's he doing?

420
00:41:56,006 --> 00:41:58,804
What's happening?

421
00:42:10,954 --> 00:42:12,251
Elliott.

422
00:42:14,758 --> 00:42:16,157
Oh, no.

423
00:42:19,095 --> 00:42:20,084
Aah!

424
00:42:29,773 --> 00:42:31,206
Elliott,
what is it?

425
00:42:31,274 --> 00:42:33,299
I don't know.
Something scary.

426
00:42:53,897 --> 00:42:54,795
Got a pulse?

427
00:42:54,864 --> 00:42:56,058
No, boss.

428
00:42:59,869 --> 00:43:02,895
Hold it.
We got it right here.

429
00:43:04,207 --> 00:43:05,333
Follow him.

430
00:43:05,408 --> 00:43:06,568
O.K.

431
00:43:08,044 --> 00:43:09,739
You think this house?

432
00:43:19,189 --> 00:43:20,679
Hmm.

433
00:43:27,530 --> 00:43:29,464
Mmm.

434
00:43:29,532 --> 00:43:32,524
Mmrrr.

435
00:43:40,944 --> 00:43:42,377
Did you
explain school?

436
00:43:42,445 --> 00:43:44,913
How do you explain school
to higher intelligence?

437
00:43:44,981 --> 00:43:48,382
Maybe he's not that smart.
Maybe he's a worker bee.

438
00:43:48,451 --> 00:43:49,383
He's smart.

439
00:43:49,452 --> 00:43:52,421
I hope we don't
wake up on Mars

440
00:43:52,489 --> 00:43:55,253
surrounded by millions
of these squashy guys.

441
00:44:01,331 --> 00:44:02,730
Hi, Elliott.

442
00:44:02,799 --> 00:44:04,767
Hey, Elliott,
where's your goblin?

443
00:44:04,834 --> 00:44:05,732
Shut up.

444
00:44:05,802 --> 00:44:07,235
Did he come back?

445
00:44:07,303 --> 00:44:08,235
Did he?

446
00:44:08,304 --> 00:44:10,238
Yeah,
he came back.

447
00:44:10,306 --> 00:44:12,274
But he's
not a goblin.

448
00:44:12,342 --> 00:44:14,242
He's a spaceman.

449
00:44:14,310 --> 00:44:16,278
As in extraterrestrial.

450
00:44:16,346 --> 00:44:17,745
Where's he from?

451
00:44:17,814 --> 00:44:19,782
Uranus? Get it?
Your anus?

452
00:44:19,849 --> 00:44:21,282
He doesn't get it.

453
00:44:21,351 --> 00:44:22,784
Get it? Your anus?

454
00:44:22,852 --> 00:44:24,285
He doesn't get it.

455
00:44:24,354 --> 00:44:25,343
You're
so immature.

456
00:44:25,422 --> 00:44:26,787
<i>And you're
a cintus suprimus.</i>

457
00:44:26,856 --> 00:44:27,788
Zero charisma.

458
00:44:27,857 --> 00:44:28,789
<i>Cintus suprimus.</i>

459
00:44:28,858 --> 00:44:29,916
Zero charisma.

460
00:44:29,993 --> 00:44:31,290
Shut up, Greg!

461
00:44:31,361 --> 00:44:33,329
<i>Cintus suprimus.</i>

462
00:44:33,396 --> 00:44:34,294
Zero charisma!

463
00:44:34,364 --> 00:44:35,422
You wimp.

464
00:44:44,774 --> 00:44:46,298
Let's go.

465
00:44:49,279 --> 00:44:51,247
Come on.
Get in the car.

466
00:44:51,314 --> 00:44:52,804
We'll be late.

467
00:45:35,358 --> 00:45:36,450
Hummm.

468
00:45:36,526 --> 00:45:36,992
OK, boys and girls,

469
00:45:38,061 --> 00:45:41,394
today we will be doing
the actual frog dissection

470
00:45:41,464 --> 00:45:43,489
for which
we've been preparing.

471
00:45:44,567 --> 00:45:47,161
And you will find...

472
00:45:47,237 --> 00:45:48,966
many similarities.

473
00:45:55,078 --> 00:45:57,478
As you get
into the dissection,

474
00:45:57,547 --> 00:46:00,072
you will discover
that the anatomy...

475
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:34,416
The scalpel
is very sharp.

476
00:46:34,484 --> 00:46:37,578
Use discretion
when you are cutting.

477
00:46:37,654 --> 00:46:40,122
There will be
very little blood.

478
00:46:40,190 --> 00:46:43,125
There may be
a few body fluids.

479
00:47:15,725 --> 00:47:17,090
Yecchh!

480
00:47:34,310 --> 00:47:36,107
As we
get started with...

481
00:47:37,247 --> 00:47:38,179
the dissection...

482
00:47:38,248 --> 00:47:39,613
Ew!
Ew!

483
00:47:39,682 --> 00:47:44,016
remember that the things
you are writing down...

484
00:47:47,690 --> 00:47:48,884
Ahhr...

485
00:47:51,895 --> 00:47:52,884
Urp!

486
00:47:54,063 --> 00:47:55,291
Some of the things

487
00:47:55,365 --> 00:47:58,300
that you should look
for during the dissection

488
00:47:58,368 --> 00:47:59,801
is the heart,

489
00:47:59,869 --> 00:48:02,895
and notice that
it is still beating.

490
00:48:05,174 --> 00:48:06,402
Oof!

491
00:48:06,476 --> 00:48:09,445
I'm going to once more
emphasize the similarities

492
00:48:09,512 --> 00:48:11,980
of those things
which we see...

493
00:48:14,550 --> 00:48:16,381
Mmm.

494
00:48:16,452 --> 00:48:20,013
Similarities with
human anatomy.

495
00:48:20,089 --> 00:48:22,819
First of all,
here's the heart.

496
00:48:28,464 --> 00:48:31,456
The intestines
will be going

497
00:48:31,534 --> 00:48:34,196
through their
peristaltic action.

498
00:48:35,471 --> 00:48:38,702
<i>X-W-V-U</i>

499
00:48:38,775 --> 00:48:41,300
<i>A-F-P.</i>

500
00:48:41,377 --> 00:48:42,901
<i>That is incorrect.</i>

501
00:48:42,979 --> 00:48:45,072
<i>The correct spelling
of nuisance</i>

502
00:48:45,148 --> 00:48:47,946
<i>is N-U-I-</i>

503
00:48:48,017 --> 00:48:50,247
<i>S-A-N-C-E.</i>

504
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:52,345
<i>Yeow!</i>

505
00:48:57,560 --> 00:48:58,959
<i>They're
pulling us up.</i>

506
00:49:05,368 --> 00:49:07,802
Class, these are
the cotton balls

507
00:49:07,870 --> 00:49:09,303
with the chloroform.

508
00:49:09,372 --> 00:49:12,273
As soon as I
get them all in,

509
00:49:12,342 --> 00:49:14,810
put the lid on
right away.

510
00:49:14,877 --> 00:49:15,809
Eww.

511
00:49:15,878 --> 00:49:17,106
That's it.

512
00:49:17,180 --> 00:49:20,206
That will start them
going to sleep.

513
00:49:23,019 --> 00:49:24,782
They won't feel anything.

514
00:49:24,854 --> 00:49:26,378
They won't be hurt.

515
00:49:28,391 --> 00:49:29,949
It'll take a little while.

516
00:49:30,026 --> 00:49:32,995
If you don't want
to watch them,

517
00:49:33,062 --> 00:49:34,552
you don't have to.

518
00:49:52,648 --> 00:49:54,673
Say hi.

519
00:49:55,852 --> 00:49:57,410
Can you talk?

520
00:49:57,487 --> 00:49:59,250
Can you say hi?

521
00:50:00,790 --> 00:50:02,189
Ahhr...

522
00:50:09,532 --> 00:50:10,692
Hic!

523
00:50:19,776 --> 00:50:21,710
Mmm...

524
00:50:24,547 --> 00:50:25,605
<i>Hello.</i>

525
00:50:25,681 --> 00:50:27,444
<i>Uncle Ralph!</i>

526
00:50:27,517 --> 00:50:30,452
<i>It's Uncle Ralph,
long distance

527
00:50:30,520 --> 00:50:32,454
<i>This call
must be expensive.</i>

528
00:50:32,522 --> 00:50:35,980
<i>Oh, no, no.
Anytime on Saturday

529
00:50:36,059 --> 00:50:38,960
<i>it's 5 minutes
for 85 cents plus tax.</i>

530
00:50:39,028 --> 00:50:41,895
<i>If I talk less,
I pay less.</i>

531
00:50:41,964 --> 00:50:44,432
<i>Let me talk to
that little fella, huh?</i>

532
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:45,467
<i>Lou, it's Uncle Ralph.</i>

533
00:50:45,535 --> 00:50:47,469
<i>Hello, Uncle Ralph.</i>

534
00:51:08,157 --> 00:51:09,681
Save him.

535
00:51:16,699 --> 00:51:19,600
Run for your life!
Back to the river!

536
00:51:19,669 --> 00:51:21,136
Back to the forest!

537
00:51:21,204 --> 00:51:23,798
Run! I want to save you!

538
00:51:23,873 --> 00:51:25,932
Let's get out of here!

539
00:51:28,044 --> 00:51:29,705
Get out!

540
00:51:29,779 --> 00:51:31,770
I got to let him go!

541
00:51:39,021 --> 00:51:40,989
You've got to save him!

542
00:52:04,814 --> 00:52:05,906
Aah!
Aah!

543
00:52:05,982 --> 00:52:07,415
Let me handle this!

544
00:52:07,483 --> 00:52:09,508
Let me handle this!

545
00:52:09,585 --> 00:52:11,314
I can handle this.

546
00:52:11,387 --> 00:52:12,877
Let me get this.

547
00:52:14,657 --> 00:52:16,215
<i>Aah!</i>

548
00:52:18,027 --> 00:52:19,358
Aah!

549
00:53:06,475 --> 00:53:08,568
<i>Stanford, what's wrong?</i>

550
00:53:08,644 --> 00:53:12,080
<i>I'm afraid Betsy Sue isn't
going to run tomorrow.</i>

551
00:53:12,148 --> 00:53:14,742
<i>Oh, no. Is it
anything serious?</i>

552
00:53:14,817 --> 00:53:17,377
Harvey, I'm home.
Come here, boy.

553
00:53:29,332 --> 00:53:30,765
Here he is.

554
00:53:30,833 --> 00:53:32,300
Here's who?

555
00:53:32,368 --> 00:53:34,268
The man from the moon,

556
00:53:34,337 --> 00:53:36,271
but you've
killed him already.

557
00:53:36,339 --> 00:53:39,365
As soon as I
unload the stuff, OK?

558
00:53:43,212 --> 00:53:44,110
Mmm.

559
00:53:44,180 --> 00:53:45,647

561
00:53:50,052 --> 00:53:52,782
This stuff has
gone up so much.

562
00:53:52,855 --> 00:53:55,289
I want you
to meet somebody.

563
00:53:55,358 --> 00:53:58,384

this stuff away, OK?

564
00:54:08,704 --> 00:54:12,071

it wouldn't come out.

Intoxicated?

576

You sure you have
the right Elliott?

587
00:55:02,925 --> 00:55:04,085
Good.

Thank you.

591
00:55:14,470 --> 00:55:17,371
Gertie, I have to go

Will you be...

593
00:55:18,941 --> 00:55:20,431
Mommy, he can talk.

594
00:55:20,509 --> 00:55:21,942
Of course he can.

595
00:55:22,011 --> 00:55:24,070

I am not paying

610
00:55:54,910 --> 00:55:57,378
Be good. Be good.

611
00:55:58,614 --> 00:56:01,174
Stay here. Stay.

612
00:56:01,250 --> 00:56:02,683
Don't tell anybody.

613
00:56:02,752 --> 00:56:04,686
No... Nobody.

Oh, God!

617
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:19,132
Elliott.

618
00:56:19,201 --> 00:56:20,168
What?

619
00:56:20,236 --> 00:56:21,225
Elliott...

620
00:56:21,303 --> 00:56:22,736
Elliott...

621
00:56:22,805 --> 00:56:25,740
I taught him
how to talk now.

622
00:56:25,808 --> 00:56:27,366
He can talk now.

623
00:56:27,443 --> 00:56:30,435
Look what he brought
up here all by himself.

624
00:56:30,513 --> 00:56:33,414
What's he need
this stuff for?

625
00:56:33,482 --> 00:56:35,211
Elliott...

626
00:56:35,284 --> 00:56:37,548

I taught him that.

634
00:56:49,098 --> 00:56:51,498
You should give
him his dignity.

635
00:56:51,567 --> 00:56:55,025
This is the most
ridiculous thing

636
00:56:55,104 --> 00:56:56,799
Phone...

637
00:56:58,274 --> 00:57:00,037
Phone?

638
00:57:00,109 --> 00:57:01,542
He said "phone"?

639
00:57:01,610 --> 00:57:02,975
He said "phone"?

640
00:57:03,045 --> 00:57:05,309
Can't you
understand English?

641
00:57:05,381 --> 00:57:06,905
He said phone.

E.T. phone home.

669
00:58:37,506 --> 00:58:40,942
Just grab anything

670
00:58:41,010 --> 00:58:42,875
<i>What would make a radar?</i>

How the hell do I know?

You're the genius here.

power, remember?

he doesn't look
too good anymore.

677
00:59:09,705 --> 00:59:11,138
Don't say that!

678
00:59:11,206 --> 00:59:12,468
We're fine!

679
00:59:12,541 --> 00:59:14,338

"we" stuff?

680
00:59:14,410 --> 00:59:16,742
<i>You say "we"
all the time.</i>

681
00:59:16,812 --> 00:59:19,212

to the movies

688

01:03:14,583 --> 01:03:17,552
Listen, buster.
You won't get four blocks

745
01:03:17,619 --> 01:03:19,712
in this neighborhood
dressed like that.

746
01:03:19,788 --> 01:03:21,688
Please.
All the guys are.

747
01:03:21,757 --> 01:03:23,850
I'm not stupid,
you know.

748
01:03:32,134 --> 01:03:33,897
Ready?

749
01:03:33,969 --> 01:03:35,129
Ready.

750
01:03:51,453 --> 01:03:53,421
Oh, wait, Mom.
Don't look.

751
01:03:53,488 --> 01:03:54,648
Oh, O.K.

752
01:04:00,629 --> 01:04:03,928
OK, Mom.
You can look now.

753
01:04:03,999 --> 01:04:05,296
Aah!

754
01:04:07,302 --> 01:04:08,826
Oh, that's great.

755
01:04:10,706 --> 01:04:12,003
Stay here.

756
01:04:19,514 --> 01:04:20,981
Ooh.

757
01:04:21,049 --> 01:04:22,516
Ohh.

758
01:04:22,584 --> 01:04:25,075
Ouch.

759
01:04:25,153 --> 01:04:26,780
Stop that!
No! Don't!

760
01:04:26,855 --> 01:04:28,720
Ouch.

761
01:04:28,790 --> 01:04:30,087
It's a fake knife.

762
01:04:30,158 --> 01:04:31,557
It's a fake.

763
01:04:31,627 --> 01:04:32,753
Ouch.

764
01:04:32,828 --> 01:04:33,920
O.K.

765
01:04:39,134 --> 01:04:40,328
All right.

766
01:04:41,436 --> 01:04:44,337
Oh, you look great!

767
01:04:44,406 --> 01:04:45,373
Thank you.

768
01:04:45,440 --> 01:04:46,372
Thank you.

769
01:04:46,441 --> 01:04:47,635
Thank you.

770
01:04:48,810 --> 01:04:50,402
Aah! Oohh!

771
01:04:55,884 --> 01:04:58,250
Be back one hour
after sundown.

772
01:04:58,320 --> 01:04:59,344
No later.

773
01:05:02,257 --> 01:05:04,384
Ohh.

774
01:05:04,459 --> 01:05:05,721
Bye.

775
01:05:07,930 --> 01:05:08,988
Aah!

776
01:05:09,064 --> 01:05:10,929
Gertie, come here.
Come on.

777
01:05:33,522 --> 01:05:35,046
Trick or treat.

778
01:05:41,029 --> 01:05:42,553
Trick or treat.

779
01:05:49,571 --> 01:05:50,765
Runff.

780
01:06:07,543 --> 01:06:09,977
Home. Home.

781
01:06:10,046 --> 01:06:12,879
Home. Home. Home.

782
01:06:12,948 --> 01:06:15,109
Home. Home. Home.

783
01:06:17,590 --> 01:06:20,024
Be back one hour
after sunset.

784
01:06:20,093 --> 01:06:21,025
No later.

785
01:06:21,094 --> 01:06:24,063
I'll try as fast
as I can, Mike.

786
01:06:24,130 --> 01:06:26,121
You got to cover me.

787
01:06:29,302 --> 01:06:31,202
Well, come on.
Help me.

788
01:06:31,271 --> 01:06:33,671
We'll be waiting
for you, Elliott.

789
01:06:33,740 --> 01:06:35,731
So come back for sure.

790
01:07:01,367 --> 01:07:02,994
It's too bumpy.

791
01:07:03,069 --> 01:07:06,038
We'll have
to walk from here!

792
01:07:06,105 --> 01:07:08,073
E.T.!

793
01:07:18,918 --> 01:07:21,978
Not so high!
Not so high!

794
01:07:50,783 --> 01:07:52,410
Ah ha!

795
01:07:59,959 --> 01:08:02,052
Don't crash, please.

796
01:08:03,796 --> 01:08:05,263
Ugh!

797
01:09:25,778 --> 01:09:29,805
I really can't believe
you did this.

798
01:09:34,387 --> 01:09:37,584
Your father's going
to hear about this one.

799
01:09:44,073 --> 01:09:45,097
Mexico.

800
01:10:55,778 --> 01:10:57,769
Where's Elliot?

801
01:10:59,849 --> 01:11:02,147
I'm asking you a question.

802
01:11:03,786 --> 01:11:08,155
Anyways, why would Elliot
go to the forest?

803
01:11:08,224 --> 01:11:10,954
Why would he
do such a thing?

804
01:11:11,027 --> 01:11:13,461
Get in the car.

805
01:11:13,529 --> 01:11:16,327
Get in the car now.

806
01:11:33,316 --> 01:11:35,250
Runff.

807
01:12:01,877 --> 01:12:03,811
E.T., it's working.

808
01:12:03,879 --> 01:12:05,369
Oh.

809
01:12:05,448 --> 01:12:07,040
It's working!

810
01:12:07,116 --> 01:12:08,811
Home.

811
01:12:08,884 --> 01:12:10,317
You did it!

812
01:12:11,887 --> 01:12:14,014
It's working!

813
01:12:14,090 --> 01:12:16,684
Home.

814
01:12:16,759 --> 01:12:20,661
E.T., it's working!

815
01:13:03,939 --> 01:13:06,840
We have to
go now, E.T.

816
01:13:06,909 --> 01:13:09,343
We're so late
already.

817
01:13:15,885 --> 01:13:18,854
We have to
go home now, E.T.

818
01:13:18,921 --> 01:13:19,910
Hmm?

819
01:13:24,894 --> 01:13:27,385
You should
give them some time.

820
01:13:29,365 --> 01:13:31,833
Ouch.

821
01:13:38,607 --> 01:13:40,472
You could
be happy here.

822
01:13:40,543 --> 01:13:42,977
I could
take care of you.

823
01:13:43,045 --> 01:13:45,513
I wouldn't let
anybody hurt you.

824
01:13:45,581 --> 01:13:47,708
We could grow up
together, E.T.

825
01:13:52,688 --> 01:13:55,418
Home.

826
01:13:56,692 --> 01:13:59,320
Home.

827
01:14:31,393 --> 01:14:34,556
Home.

828
01:14:38,567 --> 01:14:40,762
Home.

829
01:15:15,271 --> 01:15:16,465
E.T.?

830
01:15:19,775 --> 01:15:20,969
E.T.?

831
01:15:26,615 --> 01:15:30,574
Uh, how was he
dressed when

832
01:15:30,653 --> 01:15:33,679
He was
dressed as a...

833
01:15:33,756 --> 01:15:35,747
hunchback.

834
01:15:35,824 --> 01:15:37,655
Hunchback.

835
01:15:37,726 --> 01:15:39,660
Is there anything
to indicate

836
01:15:39,728 --> 01:15:41,662
that he might
have run away?

837
01:15:41,730 --> 01:15:45,666
Any family problems
or recent arguments?

838
01:15:45,734 --> 01:15:50,171
Um... my husband and I
just separated recently,

839
01:15:50,239 --> 01:15:54,869
and it hasn't been easy
on the children, but...

840
01:15:54,944 --> 01:15:57,708
My father's
in Mexico.

841
01:16:03,452 --> 01:16:05,386
But run away, I...

842
01:16:05,454 --> 01:16:07,888
Where would he
have gone?

843
01:16:07,957 --> 01:16:09,219
Elliott.

844
01:16:09,291 --> 01:16:11,521
Oh, Elliott!

845
01:16:11,594 --> 01:16:17,294
Don't ever do this
again, Elliott!

846
01:16:17,366 --> 01:16:19,926
Oh, my. You're so hot.

847
01:16:20,002 --> 01:16:23,403
Run up and draw him
a bath. Quick, Gert.

848
01:16:23,472 --> 01:16:26,168
Sorry I yelled at you.

849
01:16:28,277 --> 01:16:31,906
Um... thanks very much
for all your trouble.

850
01:16:31,981 --> 01:16:33,744
Is he here?

851
01:16:35,784 --> 01:16:38,252
You've got to
find him, Mike.

852
01:16:38,320 --> 01:16:39,753
Where is he?

853
01:16:39,822 --> 01:16:42,052
In the forest.

854
01:16:42,124 --> 01:16:44,752
At the bald spot.

855
01:16:44,827 --> 01:16:46,818
You've got
to find him.

856
01:17:37,112 --> 01:17:38,909
E.T.!

857
01:17:42,117 --> 01:17:44,085
E.T.!

858
01:17:46,455 --> 01:17:47,945
E.T.!

859
01:18:26,595 --> 01:18:28,222
No!

860
01:18:28,297 --> 01:18:29,321
No!

861
01:18:59,628 --> 01:19:02,290
Mom, would you
come with me?

862
01:19:02,364 --> 01:19:04,195
What is it?

863
01:19:04,266 --> 01:19:06,530
Mary,
just come with me.

864
01:19:06,602 --> 01:19:07,830
Michael, what?

865
01:19:07,903 --> 01:19:09,768
Mom, remember
the goblin?

866
01:19:09,838 --> 01:19:11,738
What are you
talking about?

867
01:19:11,807 --> 01:19:14,776
Swear the most
excellent promise

868
01:19:14,843 --> 01:19:15,832
Michael.

869
01:19:21,850 --> 01:19:23,613
That's terrific.

870
01:19:29,992 --> 01:19:32,756
Mom.

871
01:19:36,832 --> 01:19:39,494
We're sick.

872
01:19:41,403 --> 01:19:44,497
I think we're dying.

873
01:19:47,409 --> 01:19:48,398
Michael.

874
01:19:48,477 --> 01:19:49,910
Mom, it's O.K.

875
01:19:51,914 --> 01:19:52,846
Downstairs.

876
01:19:52,915 --> 01:19:56,112
He's not going
to hurt you, Mom.

877
01:19:56,185 --> 01:19:57,584
He won't hurt you.

878
01:19:57,653 --> 01:19:59,280
Michael,
get her downstairs.

879
01:19:59,354 --> 01:20:01,754
It's the man
from the moon.

880
01:20:01,824 --> 01:20:03,849
The man
from the moon!

881
01:20:06,795 --> 01:20:09,764
You don't know him!
You don't know him!

882
01:20:14,503 --> 01:20:16,437
We can't
leave him alone.

883
01:20:38,961 --> 01:20:39,950
Aah!

884
01:20:55,744 --> 01:20:58,008
This is my home!

885
01:21:46,561 --> 01:21:48,028
Home.

886
01:21:50,232 --> 01:21:51,358
Home.

887
01:22:15,524 --> 01:22:17,890
Check the north
perimeter.

888
01:22:20,362 --> 01:22:22,956
Check the north
perimeter.

889
01:22:25,267 --> 01:22:28,634
Is it fine?
Tent OK?

890
01:22:31,273 --> 01:22:32,638
The collagen unit,

891
01:22:32,708 --> 01:22:35,700
report to the blue level
immediately.

892
01:22:43,285 --> 01:22:46,220
Regulate oxygen level
on countdown.

893
01:23:07,909 --> 01:23:09,843
Does he sleep
at night?

894
01:23:09,911 --> 01:23:11,378
I don't know.

895
01:23:11,446 --> 01:23:13,380
What's the matter
with Elliott?

896
01:23:13,448 --> 01:23:15,814
Have you noticed
any surface sweating?

897
01:23:15,884 --> 01:23:16,816
No.

898
01:23:16,885 --> 01:23:18,318
Has it lost hair?

899
01:23:18,387 --> 01:23:20,355
He never
had any hair.

900
01:23:20,422 --> 01:23:22,356
Are the children
all right?

901
01:23:22,424 --> 01:23:24,824
Did it build
or write anything?

902
01:23:24,893 --> 01:23:26,383
Uh, no.

903
01:23:26,461 --> 01:23:28,895
You say it
has the ability

904
01:23:28,964 --> 01:23:30,898
to manipulate
its own environment?

905
01:23:30,966 --> 01:23:33,935
He's smart.
He communicates

906
01:23:34,002 --> 01:23:36,994
Elliott thinks
its thoughts.

907
01:23:37,072 --> 01:23:38,835
No. Elliott...

908
01:23:38,907 --> 01:23:41,432
Elliott feels
his feelings.

909
01:23:45,514 --> 01:23:47,675
We've identified
his primary carrier protein.

910
01:23:47,749 --> 01:23:49,478
It's definitely not Albumin.

911
01:23:49,551 --> 01:23:52,850
The testing shows no deficits
on FNF and HTS testing.

912
01:23:52,921 --> 01:23:55,412
EEG analysis shows complete
coherence and synchronization

913
01:23:55,490 --> 01:23:57,481
of brain wave activity
between both subjects.

914
01:24:05,167 --> 01:24:06,828
There's no response
at 20 per kilo.

915
01:24:06,902 --> 01:24:08,631
Let's move
to hypertonic saline.

916
01:24:10,138 --> 01:24:12,129
Cut five per kilo.

917
01:24:16,511 --> 01:24:19,878
You have no right
to do this.

918
01:24:19,948 --> 01:24:21,438
You're scaring him.

919
01:24:21,516 --> 01:24:23,609
You're scaring him!

920
01:24:23,885 --> 01:24:25,045
Respiratory rate:12.

921
01:24:25,120 --> 01:24:27,680
Good air entry but decreased
tidal volume on the boy.

922
01:24:27,756 --> 01:24:31,988
Put him on 0-2-5 liters
and draw blood in 20 minutes.

923
01:24:33,595 --> 01:24:35,460
Get a hypothermia blanket
and some warming rags.

924
01:24:35,530 --> 01:24:38,499
Leave him alone.

925
01:24:38,567 --> 01:24:41,434
Leave him alone.
I can take

926
01:24:41,503 --> 01:24:44,131
Set me up for
a 2-D cardiac echo.

927
01:24:44,206 --> 01:24:46,640
Skin is cool and diaphoretic.

928
01:24:46,708 --> 01:24:49,643
He's not refusing at all.
He needs anatropic support.

929
01:24:49,711 --> 01:24:52,009
Ph is down to 7.03.

930
01:24:52,080 --> 01:24:55,641
He's got a metabolic acidosis.
It could be sepsis.

931
01:24:56,651 --> 01:24:58,243
We've drawn two sets
of blood cultures.

932
01:24:58,320 --> 01:25:01,483
He needs broad
spectrum coverage.

933
01:25:08,830 --> 01:25:10,422
Elliott.

934
01:25:12,934 --> 01:25:14,834
I've been
to the forest.

935
01:25:14,903 --> 01:25:17,394
He shouldn't
talk now.

936
01:25:17,472 --> 01:25:20,964
Well, he has to
talk now, Major.

937
01:25:23,311 --> 01:25:25,438
Elliott,
that machine...

938
01:25:25,514 --> 01:25:29,075
what does it do?

939
01:25:29,151 --> 01:25:32,780
The communicator?

940
01:25:32,854 --> 01:25:35,755
Is it still working?

941
01:25:35,824 --> 01:25:38,884
It's doing something.

942
01:25:38,960 --> 01:25:40,757
What?

943
01:25:40,829 --> 01:25:44,128
I really
shouldn't tell.

944
01:25:44,199 --> 01:25:46,633
He came to me.

945
01:25:46,701 --> 01:25:50,102
He came to me.

946
01:25:50,172 --> 01:25:53,608
Elliott,
he came to me, too.

947
01:25:53,675 --> 01:25:55,609
I've been
wishing for this

948
01:25:55,677 --> 01:25:58,111
since I was
10 years old.

949
01:25:58,180 --> 01:26:00,614
I don't want him
to die.

950
01:26:00,682 --> 01:26:04,277
What can we do that
we're not already doing?

951
01:26:04,352 --> 01:26:09,085
He needs to go home.

952
01:26:09,157 --> 01:26:12,752
He's calling
his people...

953
01:26:12,827 --> 01:26:17,389
and I don't know
where they are.

954
01:26:17,465 --> 01:26:20,161
He needs to go home.

955
01:26:20,235 --> 01:26:21,998
Elliott, I don't think

956
01:26:22,070 --> 01:26:24,766
that he was left here
intentionally.

957
01:26:27,242 --> 01:26:31,144
But his being here
is a miracle, Elliott.

958
01:26:31,213 --> 01:26:34,182
It's a miracle,

959
01:26:34,249 --> 01:26:37,844
and you did the best
that anybody could do.

960
01:26:40,722 --> 01:26:43,350
I'm glad
he met you first.

961
01:26:52,801 --> 01:26:53,733
He's got DNA.

962
01:26:53,802 --> 01:26:55,201
Incredible.

963
01:26:55,270 --> 01:26:56,737
He's got DNA!

964
01:26:56,771 --> 01:26:59,001
He doesn't have
four nucleotides like we do.

965
01:26:59,074 --> 01:27:01,542
He has six.
Desynchronization

966
01:27:04,613 --> 01:27:05,545
E.T.!

967
01:27:05,614 --> 01:27:07,582
The boy's condition
is stabilizing.

968
01:27:07,649 --> 01:27:09,173
Blood pressure's
back up.

969
01:27:10,752 --> 01:27:13,084
E.T.

970
01:27:13,154 --> 01:27:15,645
Elliott.

971
01:27:15,724 --> 01:27:17,385
He's speaking.
He's talking.

972
01:27:17,459 --> 01:27:19,586
E.T...

973
01:27:19,661 --> 01:27:22,323
stay with me.

974
01:27:23,832 --> 01:27:25,026
Please.

975
01:27:25,100 --> 01:27:27,261
Stay...

976
01:27:27,335 --> 01:27:28,666
Together.

977
01:27:28,737 --> 01:27:32,434
I'll be right here.

978
01:27:32,507 --> 01:27:35,840
I'll be right here.

979
01:27:37,512 --> 01:27:40,072
Stay...

980
01:27:40,148 --> 01:27:44,915
Elliott.

981
01:27:44,986 --> 01:27:47,011
Stay.

982
01:27:48,189 --> 01:27:50,487
Stay.

983
01:27:52,727 --> 01:27:56,629
Stay.

984
01:27:56,698 --> 01:27:59,098
Stay.

985
01:27:59,167 --> 01:28:01,863
The creature's pressure
is bottoming out.

986
01:28:01,936 --> 01:28:03,267
How's the boy?

987
01:28:03,338 --> 01:28:06,705
He's converting back
to normal sinus rhythm.

988
01:28:08,143 --> 01:28:09,075
They're separating.

989
01:28:09,144 --> 01:28:11,442
Boy and creature
are separating.

990
01:28:11,513 --> 01:28:12,946
What does
that mean?

991
01:28:13,014 --> 01:28:15,414
The boy's coming back.
We're losing E.T.

992
01:28:15,483 --> 01:28:19,510
E.T., answer me, please.

993
01:28:19,587 --> 01:28:21,214
Please.

994
01:28:21,289 --> 01:28:23,257
Just relax.

995
01:29:30,925 --> 01:29:32,290
No!

996
01:29:32,360 --> 01:29:33,918
E.T., don't go!

997
01:29:33,995 --> 01:29:35,394
No blood pressure.

998
01:29:35,463 --> 01:29:37,897
He's got no pulse
or respiration.

999
01:29:37,966 --> 01:29:40,901
We can't
get a pulse

1000
01:29:40,969 --> 01:29:43,335
It doesn't look
like he's breathing.

1001
01:29:45,840 --> 01:29:47,637
Leave him alone!

1002
01:29:47,709 --> 01:29:49,768
You're killing him!

1003
01:29:49,844 --> 01:29:51,277
Leave him alone!

1004
01:29:51,346 --> 01:29:53,177
Let's move it!

1005
01:29:53,248 --> 01:29:55,307
Get the boy out.

1006
01:29:55,383 --> 01:29:57,681
Stop it!
You're killing him!

1007
01:29:57,752 --> 01:29:59,481
You're killing him!

1008
01:29:59,554 --> 01:30:01,613
Let's go.
Move it out.

1009
01:30:01,689 --> 01:30:04,123
You're killing him!
You're killing him!

1010
01:30:04,192 --> 01:30:07,525
You're killing him!
He came to me!

1011
01:30:07,595 --> 01:30:09,586
Let's ventilate him.
Any pulses?

1012
01:30:09,664 --> 01:30:10,790
Move it.

1013
01:30:10,865 --> 01:30:12,765
He came to me!

1014
01:30:12,834 --> 01:30:13,926
Let's start.

1015
01:30:14,002 --> 01:30:15,697
60 per minute.

1016
01:30:18,339 --> 01:30:19,897
Minimal breath sounds.

1017
01:30:19,974 --> 01:30:22,966
Calm down.
Calm down. Calm...

1018
01:30:24,879 --> 01:30:26,471
Let's try some
bertyllium.

1019
01:30:26,548 --> 01:30:28,516
Can we have
some bertyllium?

1020
01:30:28,583 --> 01:30:30,175
Getting a pulse?

1021
01:30:30,251 --> 01:30:31,275
5 milligrams.

1022
01:30:31,352 --> 01:30:33,650
Compressed air.
Compressed air's fine.

1023
01:30:33,721 --> 01:30:35,586
Thank you.

1024
01:30:35,657 --> 01:30:37,215
All IV push.

1025
01:30:37,292 --> 01:30:39,055
He's not ventilating.

1026
01:30:39,127 --> 01:30:42,153
His pupils are fixed
and dilated.

1027
01:30:42,230 --> 01:30:43,197
More drugs.

1028
01:30:43,264 --> 01:30:44,162
Quiet.

1029
01:30:44,232 --> 01:30:46,132
Defibrillate him.

1030
01:30:46,201 --> 01:30:48,362
Losing him.
We're losing him.

1031
01:30:48,436 --> 01:30:49,869
Let's go.

1032
01:30:49,938 --> 01:30:51,405
Everybody stand clear.

1033
01:30:51,473 --> 01:30:52,440
Clear.

1034
01:30:52,507 --> 01:30:54,202
We're losing him.

1035
01:30:54,275 --> 01:30:55,902
One more time.

1036
01:30:57,512 --> 01:30:58,410
Quiet!

1037
01:30:58,480 --> 01:30:59,947
It's still defib.

1038
01:31:00,014 --> 01:31:01,447
OK, let's go.

1039
01:31:01,516 --> 01:31:03,040
Let's go.
Let's go.

1040
01:31:08,857 --> 01:31:10,916
Elliott?

1041
01:31:12,694 --> 01:31:13,922
Mom.

1042
01:31:25,406 --> 01:31:27,874
He needs calcium
in his body.

1043
01:31:27,942 --> 01:31:29,637
Let's continue CPR,
please.

1044
01:31:45,193 --> 01:31:47,218
Would you people
stand back?

1045
01:31:52,200 --> 01:31:54,134
Something's
happening.

1046
01:31:54,202 --> 01:31:56,170
Ooh, they're
going to die.

1047
01:31:56,237 --> 01:31:57,636
Shut up, Greg.

1048
01:31:57,705 --> 01:31:59,570
Something is
definitely happening.

1049
01:31:59,641 --> 01:32:01,040
Anybody have
any ideas?

1050
01:32:01,109 --> 01:32:03,009
EEG's flat.
EKG's flat.

1051
01:32:03,077 --> 01:32:05,545
OK, I'm going
to call it.

1052
01:32:05,613 --> 01:32:07,012
I think he's dead.

1053
01:32:07,081 --> 01:32:08,514
No. I don't know.

1054
01:32:08,583 --> 01:32:10,551
What time
do you have?

1055
01:32:10,618 --> 01:32:11,516
15:36.

1056
01:32:11,586 --> 01:32:14,111
15 hours,
36 minutes.

1057
01:32:14,188 --> 01:32:15,655
O.K.

1058
01:32:15,723 --> 01:32:17,987
Let's pack him in ice.

1059
01:32:19,527 --> 01:32:20,858
Let's leave.

1060
01:33:26,861 --> 01:33:30,058
Is he dead, mama?

1061
01:33:30,131 --> 01:33:32,224
I think so,
sweetheart.

1062
01:33:32,300 --> 01:33:36,236
Can we wish
for him to come back?

1063
01:33:36,304 --> 01:33:38,238
Yeah.

1064
01:33:38,306 --> 01:33:40,433
I wish.

1065
01:33:40,508 --> 01:33:42,499
I wish, too.

1066
01:33:51,219 --> 01:33:52,652
Come on, Gert.

1067
01:33:52,720 --> 01:33:55,621
We'll wait for Elliott
in the front room.

1068
01:33:57,291 --> 01:33:58,849
Cardiac arrest
was terminated

1069
01:33:58,926 --> 01:34:02,225
at 1500 hours
and 36 minutes.

1070
01:34:02,296 --> 01:34:05,129
He received
intravenous

1071
01:34:05,199 --> 01:34:06,666
intravenous
epinephrine

1072
01:34:06,734 --> 01:34:08,167
on a lidocaine
drip,

1073
01:34:08,236 --> 01:34:10,761
2.7%
sodium-chloride

1074
01:34:10,838 --> 01:34:12,738
catheters from
the "A" line.

1075
01:34:12,807 --> 01:34:14,274
And the
intravenous line

1076
01:34:14,342 --> 01:34:17,209
should be sent
for culture.

1077
01:34:17,278 --> 01:34:19,712
He was monitored
with a...

1078
01:34:19,781 --> 01:34:23,114
EEG and an EKG,

1079
01:34:23,184 --> 01:34:25,015
he was
defibrillated.

1080
01:34:25,086 --> 01:34:28,021
They're going to have
to take him away now.

1081
01:34:28,089 --> 01:34:30,523
They'll just
cut him all up.

1082
01:34:30,591 --> 01:34:34,618
Would you like
to spend some time

1083
01:34:49,944 --> 01:34:53,744
Could we all step out
for a minute, please?

1084
01:35:47,335 --> 01:35:50,327
Look at what
they've done to you.

1085
01:35:53,207 --> 01:35:55,141
I'm so sorry.

1086
01:36:00,715 --> 01:36:03,149
You must be dead...

1087
01:36:05,119 --> 01:36:06,279
because...

1088
01:36:06,354 --> 01:36:09,187
I don't know
how to feel.

1089
01:36:12,727 --> 01:36:15,252
I can't feel
anything anymore.

1090
01:36:17,698 --> 01:36:21,031
You've gone
someplace else now.

1091
01:36:28,376 --> 01:36:31,539
I'll believe in you
all my life.

1092
01:36:33,047 --> 01:36:34,674
Every day.

1093
01:36:39,253 --> 01:36:40,550
E.T...

1094
01:36:43,791 --> 01:36:45,315
I love you.

1095
01:37:16,490 --> 01:37:18,720
Oh, my God.

1096
01:37:25,066 --> 01:37:27,626
E.T. phone home.

1097
01:37:27,702 --> 01:37:29,602
Ah ha!

1098
01:37:29,670 --> 01:37:31,501
Phone home.

1099
01:37:31,572 --> 01:37:33,096
Phone home.

1100
01:37:33,174 --> 01:37:35,301
Does this mean
they're coming?

1101
01:37:35,376 --> 01:37:37,401
Yes.

1102
01:37:37,478 --> 01:37:39,571
Aah!

1103
01:37:39,647 --> 01:37:41,376
E.T. phone home.

1104
01:37:41,449 --> 01:37:42,780
E.T. phone home.

1105
01:37:42,850 --> 01:37:43,817
Stay.

1106
01:37:43,885 --> 01:37:45,648
Shut up.

1107
01:37:45,720 --> 01:37:47,017
Phone.

1108
01:37:47,088 --> 01:37:48,055
Phone home.

1109
01:37:48,122 --> 01:37:49,146
Quiet!

1110
01:37:49,223 --> 01:37:50,315
Phone! Phone!

1111
01:37:50,391 --> 01:37:52,586
Would you shut up?

1112
01:37:52,660 --> 01:37:53,627

Phone home.

1119
01:38:02,203 --> 01:38:03,534
Elliott.

1120
01:38:03,604 --> 01:38:04,536
Elliott.

1121
01:38:04,605 --> 01:38:05,731
Elliott.

1122
01:38:05,806 --> 01:38:06,738
Stay.

1123
01:38:06,807 --> 01:38:07,831
Stay.

1124
01:38:09,410 --> 01:38:10,604
Elliott.

1125
01:38:18,286 --> 01:38:21,221
Elliott,
why don't you

1126
01:38:21,289 --> 01:38:22,278
No.

1127
01:38:22,356 --> 01:38:24,722
Why don't you
come with me?

1128
01:38:24,792 --> 01:38:25,816
No.

1129
01:38:25,893 --> 01:38:26,985
No.

1130
01:38:27,061 --> 01:38:27,993
No. No.

1131
01:38:28,062 --> 01:38:29,393
It's all right.

1132
01:38:29,463 --> 01:38:30,487
No!

1133
01:38:34,669 --> 01:38:36,637
Would you like
the flower?

1134
01:38:36,704 --> 01:38:38,035
Aah!

1135
01:38:41,409 --> 01:38:43,070
He's alive!

1136
01:38:43,144 --> 01:38:44,634
He's alive!

1137
01:38:44,712 --> 01:38:45,610
All right!

1138
01:38:45,680 --> 01:38:47,477
It's glowing
right here.

1139
01:38:58,893 --> 01:39:00,861
Are they gone, mama?

1140
01:39:00,928 --> 01:39:02,327
Who's gone, honey?

1141
01:39:02,396 --> 01:39:03,488
The boys.

1142
01:39:03,564 --> 01:39:04,826
What boys?

1143
01:39:04,899 --> 01:39:09,336
I'm supposed to give you
this note when they're gone.

1144
01:39:09,403 --> 01:39:12,270
Give it to me now,
Gertie.

1145
01:39:19,880 --> 01:39:21,575
Oh, my God.

1146
01:39:29,957 --> 01:39:32,482
Give me
a hand with this.

1147
01:39:39,200 --> 01:39:40,132
Aah!

1148
01:39:40,201 --> 01:39:41,634
Where's your mask?

1149
01:39:41,702 --> 01:39:42,634
Back here.

1150
01:39:42,703 --> 01:39:44,637
Well, get it on!

1151
01:39:44,705 --> 01:39:46,002
I'm trying!

1152
01:39:51,412 --> 01:39:53,676
Hey, who are you?

1153
01:39:53,748 --> 01:39:55,682
I'm driving.

1154
01:39:57,618 --> 01:39:59,017
Open the door,
son.

1155
01:39:59,086 --> 01:40:01,350
Somebody's here.
What do I do?

1156
01:40:01,422 --> 01:40:04,880
What are you waiting for?
Let's go!

1157
01:40:04,959 --> 01:40:06,483
Let's get out of here!

1158
01:40:06,560 --> 01:40:09,461
I've never driven
forward before!

1159
01:40:11,332 --> 01:40:12,526
Aah!

1160
01:40:16,937 --> 01:40:17,926
Get the bikes.

1161
01:40:18,005 --> 01:40:19,973
Meet us
at the playground

1162
01:40:20,041 --> 01:40:22,373
at the top
of the hill.

1163
01:40:42,396 --> 01:40:45,661
We'll all die,
and I'll never

1164
01:40:49,136 --> 01:40:50,603
Where's
the playground?

1165
01:40:50,671 --> 01:40:52,536
It's near the preschool!

1166
01:40:52,606 --> 01:40:53,630
Where's that?

1167
01:40:53,707 --> 01:40:55,072
I don't know streets.

1168
01:40:55,142 --> 01:40:57,133
Mom always drives me.

1169
01:40:57,211 --> 01:40:59,236
Son of a bitch.

1170
01:41:25,139 --> 01:41:26,367
Where are you going?

1171
01:41:26,440 --> 01:41:27,771
To the spaceship.

1172
01:41:27,842 --> 01:41:28,934
Shh!

1173
01:41:29,009 --> 01:41:32,445
To the spaceship
to the moon.

1174
01:41:32,513 --> 01:41:33,537
Quiet!

1175
01:41:35,216 --> 01:41:36,979
Oh, my God.

1176
01:41:37,051 --> 01:41:39,417
Stop the van!

1177
01:41:43,357 --> 01:41:44,984
Don't pull it off!

1178
01:41:58,139 --> 01:41:59,697
That did it!

1179
01:42:47,254 --> 01:42:50,280
O.K. He's a man
from outer space,

1180
01:42:50,357 --> 01:42:53,019
and we're taking him
to his spaceship.

1181
01:42:53,093 --> 01:42:55,721
Well, can't he
just beam up?

1182
01:42:55,796 --> 01:42:57,855
This is reality,
Greg.

1183
01:42:59,700 --> 01:43:01,099
Keep her back!

1184
01:43:01,168 --> 01:43:02,135
No!

1185
01:43:02,203 --> 01:43:03,602
Hold her back!

1186
01:43:05,573 --> 01:43:08,542
No! No! No! No!

1187
01:43:08,609 --> 01:43:10,076
Where are they?

1188
01:43:10,144 --> 01:43:11,873
There's nobody here.

1189
01:43:17,918 --> 01:43:19,476
Runff runff.

1190
01:43:19,553 --> 01:43:20,952
Where are we going?

1191
01:43:21,021 --> 01:43:22,545
To the forest!

1192
01:43:25,926 --> 01:43:27,257
Follow me!

1193
01:43:59,293 --> 01:44:01,625
We got them
at the hill.

1194
01:44:17,311 --> 01:44:18,778
This is Unit 302.

1195
01:44:18,846 --> 01:44:20,279
We've cut
the kids off

1196
01:44:20,347 --> 01:44:22,713
at the bottom
of the hill.

1197
01:44:40,534 --> 01:44:41,694
Runff.

1198
01:44:47,141 --> 01:44:48,574
Let's split up.

1199
01:44:48,642 --> 01:44:49,734
OK!

1200
01:44:58,018 --> 01:44:59,610
Hang on!

1201
01:44:59,687 --> 01:45:00,745
Runff.

1202
01:45:20,507 --> 01:45:22,873
We made it!

1203
01:45:22,943 --> 01:45:23,967
Whoa!

1204
01:45:28,382 --> 01:45:29,974
Runff.

1205
01:45:49,536 --> 01:45:50,503
Whoa!

1206
01:45:50,571 --> 01:45:51,629
Whoa!

1207
01:46:00,647 --> 01:46:03,445
Tell me when it's over!

1208
01:47:15,889 --> 01:47:17,686
Home.

1209
01:48:04,905 --> 01:48:06,736
Stop the car, Mama!

1210
01:48:06,807 --> 01:48:08,240
They're over there!

1211
01:48:08,308 --> 01:48:10,640
They're over there!

1212
01:48:25,125 --> 01:48:30,153
I just wanted
to say goodbye.

1213
01:48:30,230 --> 01:48:32,460
He doesn't know
goodbye.

1214
01:48:34,868 --> 01:48:37,302
Be good.

1215
01:48:38,672 --> 01:48:39,969
Yes.

1216
01:48:54,588 --> 01:48:56,055
Ahh...

1217
01:49:07,701 --> 01:49:09,259
Thank...

1218
01:49:09,336 --> 01:49:11,031
you.

1219
01:49:12,406 --> 01:49:13,566
You're welcome.

1220
01:49:40,200 --> 01:49:42,100
Come.

1221
01:49:46,340 --> 01:49:47,898
Stay.

1222
01:49:49,176 --> 01:49:50,803
Ahh...

1223
01:49:58,485 --> 01:49:59,918
Ouch.

1224
01:50:06,360 --> 01:50:08,055
Ouch.

1225
01:51:18,532 --> 01:51:21,990
I'll be...

1226
01:51:22,069 --> 01:51:24,435
right here.

1227
01:51:33,847 --> 01:51:35,041
Bye.

1228
01:53:45,773 --> 01:54:00,845

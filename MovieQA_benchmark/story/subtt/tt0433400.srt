00:00:24,688 --> 00:00:27,452
Dear Jamie,
when we're together,

2
00:00:27,524 --> 00:00:30,823
I feel like we're
not in high school,

3
00:00:30,894 --> 00:00:34,091
but in our own little
Chris-and-Jamie world.

4
00:00:34,164 --> 00:00:36,496
Whether we're watching
"Party of Five"

5
00:00:36,567 --> 00:00:39,035
or practicing our cheers,

6
00:00:39,103 --> 00:00:42,231
I feel like I can
just be myself.

7
00:00:42,306 --> 00:00:46,572
Jamie, we've been friends
for a really long time,

8
00:00:46,643 --> 00:00:48,577
but I want to be
more than that.

9
00:00:48,645 --> 00:00:51,170
I don't think so.

10
00:00:53,617 --> 00:00:55,642
Hoping to be
your boyfriend.

11
00:00:55,719 --> 00:00:57,653
Sincerely, Chris Brander.

12
00:00:57,721 --> 00:00:59,382
BFF!

13
00:00:59,456 --> 00:01:02,254
# I swear #

14
00:01:02,326 --> 00:01:07,730
# By the moon and the stars
in the skies #

15
00:01:07,798 --> 00:01:10,665
# I'll be there, yeah #

16
00:01:10,734 --> 00:01:13,635
# And I swear #

17
00:01:13,704 --> 00:01:19,108
# Like a shadow
that's by your side #

18
00:01:19,176 --> 00:01:23,112
# I'll be there #

19
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:25,307
# For better or worse... #

20
00:01:25,382 --> 00:01:28,249
- Raise your hand if your brother's a homo!
- # Till death do us part... #

21
00:01:28,318 --> 00:01:30,980
- Get out of my room!
- Mom!

22
00:01:31,054 --> 00:01:34,285
Stupid! Anybody ever hear
of privacy around here?!

23
00:01:34,358 --> 00:01:37,555
- # I swear #
- You're the homo.

24
00:01:45,636 --> 00:01:47,228
Jamie!

25
00:01:47,304 --> 00:01:49,033
Yeah, I signed
your yearbook.

26
00:01:49,106 --> 00:01:51,574
You feel the same
way about me?

27
00:01:51,642 --> 00:01:53,269
You want a kiss?

28
00:01:55,212 --> 00:01:57,646
Jamie,
I signed your yearbook.

29
00:01:57,714 --> 00:01:59,705
Jamie,
I'm opening your gate.

30
00:02:17,134 --> 00:02:18,931
What's up, guys?

31
00:02:19,002 --> 00:02:20,936
Class of '95.

32
00:02:21,004 --> 00:02:24,337
Hey, what's up, Leon, Trevor?
Great season. Great.

33
00:02:27,845 --> 00:02:29,779
I love you.

34
00:02:29,847 --> 00:02:32,714
- Hey, guys.
- Chris Brander, ladies and gentlemen!

35
00:02:32,783 --> 00:02:34,876
- Happy graduation, Chris.
- What's going on?

36
00:02:34,952 --> 00:02:36,852
I thought it was supposed to be
just the four of us.

37
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:38,649
The Palaminos decided
to throw Jamie

38
00:02:38,722 --> 00:02:41,247
- a surprise graduation party.
- Oh, that's just great!

39
00:02:41,325 --> 00:02:43,919
- Tonight's the night.
- Where is she?

40
00:02:43,994 --> 00:02:46,792
I think I saw her go in the garage
with the football team.

41
00:02:47,998 --> 00:02:50,660
- Sweet.
- No fear, Chris? This is your

42
00:02:50,734 --> 00:02:53,498
- chance to get out of the "friend zone."
- Yeah.

43
00:02:53,822 --> 00:02:55,561
Okay.

44
00:02:59,409 --> 00:03:01,274
#... for hip hop
this is hip hop for today #

45
00:03:01,345 --> 00:03:02,903
# I give props to hip hop,
so hip hop hooray... #

46
00:03:03,046 --> 00:03:05,480
Jamie.

47
00:03:05,549 --> 00:03:08,575
- Chris!
- Yay!

48
00:03:08,652 --> 00:03:12,144
You came, finally!
I'm so happy.

49
00:03:12,222 --> 00:03:15,385
Oh, come on,
come on!

50
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:25,466
Oh my God,
we graduated!

51
00:03:29,306 --> 00:03:30,432
- God.
- Yeah.

52
00:03:30,507 --> 00:03:32,873
What's up?

53
00:03:32,943 --> 00:03:35,935
There's something I've been
meaning to say to you.

54
00:03:36,013 --> 00:03:38,140
Jamie!
There you are.

55
00:03:38,215 --> 00:03:40,775
- Hey, Tim.
- Shut up, chubs.

56
00:03:40,851 --> 00:03:42,614
Funny guy!

57
00:03:42,686 --> 00:03:45,519
Jamie...

58
00:03:45,589 --> 00:03:48,820
- will you sign my yearbook, please?
- Can I do it later, Tim?

59
00:03:48,892 --> 00:03:51,690
Can I do you later?

60
00:03:54,998 --> 00:03:56,625
I need a beer!

61
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:59,100
I can't believe...

62
00:03:59,169 --> 00:04:00,693
- I went out with him.
- You went out with him.

63
00:04:00,771 --> 00:04:03,535
Jinx! 1-2-3-4-5-6-7, can't say
a thing till I say...

64
00:04:09,613 --> 00:04:12,173
Come in.

65
00:04:14,384 --> 00:04:17,114
- Oh, hi. Hi, Jamie.
- Hey, Dusty.

66
00:04:18,322 --> 00:04:20,483
I was hoping
I'd find you here.

67
00:04:20,557 --> 00:04:22,252
I didn't know
you played guitar.

68
00:04:22,326 --> 00:04:24,226
L-I r-really...

69
00:04:24,294 --> 00:04:26,344
I really want to be a famous musician.

70
00:04:27,264 --> 00:04:30,097
And, um,
I wrote you a song.

71
00:04:30,167 --> 00:04:33,500
He wrote me a song!
That's so cute.

72
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:35,197
It's called
"Jamie Smiles."

73
00:04:40,711 --> 00:04:42,736
# When Jam... #

74
00:04:42,813 --> 00:04:44,246
Hold on.

75
00:04:47,617 --> 00:04:49,482
# When Jamie... #

76
00:04:51,355 --> 00:04:53,084
He's crazy.

77
00:04:53,156 --> 00:04:54,919
# When Jamie... #

78
00:04:54,992 --> 00:04:57,927
God damn it!
Come on, Dusty!

79
00:04:57,995 --> 00:05:01,522
Dusty, come here.

80
00:05:01,598 --> 00:05:03,657
Maybe you should come back
another time when you're...

81
00:05:03,734 --> 00:05:05,929
- Oh, no, I got it.
- You can come back

82
00:05:06,003 --> 00:05:07,937
and then play it
for us later, okay?

83
00:05:08,005 --> 00:05:10,030
- I really... I've got it. It's beautiful.
- Yeah.

84
00:05:10,107 --> 00:05:11,972
- It is.
- Bye, Dusty.

85
00:05:13,677 --> 00:05:15,372
Jesus.

86
00:05:15,445 --> 00:05:16,935
Yeah.

87
00:05:17,014 --> 00:05:19,107
Oh, I almost forgot.

88
00:05:19,182 --> 00:05:22,345
I got you a little
something right here.

89
00:05:22,419 --> 00:05:24,353
Okay. Now I know
it's a little dorky,

90
00:05:24,421 --> 00:05:26,355
but I had to do it.

91
00:05:26,423 --> 00:05:28,357
So look at it.

92
00:05:28,425 --> 00:05:30,359
Will you put it
on for me?

93
00:05:30,427 --> 00:05:32,224
- Now?
- Please, please? Put it on.

94
00:05:32,295 --> 00:05:34,786
- Okay. Quickly.
- Okay okay okay okay.

95
00:05:34,865 --> 00:05:36,594
- I think it's gonna fit.
- Yeah.

96
00:05:36,666 --> 00:05:38,793
- Let's see.
- Okay.

97
00:05:38,869 --> 00:05:40,734
- Here we go.
- Okay.

98
00:05:45,609 --> 00:05:47,338
It's a little snug.

99
00:05:47,411 --> 00:05:49,845
Oh my God,
isn't that so cute?

100
00:05:49,913 --> 00:05:51,847
"Shakes come and go,

101
00:05:51,915 --> 00:05:53,507
but friends are
furrr-ever!"

102
00:05:53,583 --> 00:05:55,676
That's adorable!
Let's go show my mom.

103
00:05:55,752 --> 00:05:57,743
She'll love it. Let's go
show her. Come on.

104
00:05:57,821 --> 00:05:59,721
- Let's not. No no. Come on.
- Chris, she's gonna love it!

105
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:01,087
Just... just wait.

106
00:06:01,158 --> 00:06:04,150
- Just... we're busy!
- Chris, are you okay?

107
00:06:04,227 --> 00:06:06,593
Yes, I'm fine.
I just...

108
00:06:07,831 --> 00:06:09,560
I signed your yearbook.

109
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,067
Um...

110
00:06:12,135 --> 00:06:14,763
read it...
please.

111
00:06:14,838 --> 00:06:16,032
Okay.

112
00:06:20,143 --> 00:06:22,668
Please, God.

113
00:06:22,746 --> 00:06:26,273
"Stud muffin, getting it on
in your love truck was hot!"

114
00:06:26,349 --> 00:06:28,681
- Oh!
- Wait! That's not what I wrote!

115
00:06:28,752 --> 00:06:30,720
This is Tim's yearbook.

116
00:06:32,222 --> 00:06:34,816
- Chris?
- Oh my God!

117
00:06:34,891 --> 00:06:37,257
Listen to this.
Listen to this.

118
00:06:37,327 --> 00:06:39,090
"When we're together,
I feel"...

119
00:06:39,162 --> 00:06:41,096
- Gimme!
- "Like we're not in high school, but we're

120
00:06:41,164 --> 00:06:43,826
- in our own Chris-and-Jamie little world."
- Tim... okay.

121
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:45,959
Okay.

122
00:06:46,036 --> 00:06:48,334
- "You're my best friend..."
- Please, don't read that.

123
00:06:48,405 --> 00:06:50,339
"But I want to be
more than that"?

124
00:06:51,908 --> 00:06:53,899
"Hoping to be
your boyfriend.

125
00:06:53,977 --> 00:06:57,469
Sincerely, Chris Brander,
BFF."

126
00:06:57,547 --> 00:07:00,675
It's a joke! That's a joke
between me and Jamie!

127
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:02,547
Holy shit!
Check out his shirt!

128
00:07:10,594 --> 00:07:12,721
Aw, he's gonna cry.

129
00:07:12,796 --> 00:07:14,525
See ya!

130
00:07:15,699 --> 00:07:17,599
G'bye, fatty!

131
00:07:18,835 --> 00:07:20,359
Chris!

132
00:07:20,437 --> 00:07:22,803
Try a salad!

133
00:07:22,873 --> 00:07:24,807
- Chris!
- Leave me alone!

134
00:07:24,875 --> 00:07:27,036
Don't worry about it.
It happens to everybody.

135
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:30,409
Chris! We need to talk
about what you wrote.

136
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,414
Is that really
how you feel?

137
00:07:32,482 --> 00:07:34,973
I don't know.
Maybe. Why?

138
00:07:35,051 --> 00:07:37,952
Because that's the nicest thing
anyone's ever written me.

139
00:07:38,021 --> 00:07:40,148
It was?

140
00:07:40,223 --> 00:07:41,554
Yes.

141
00:07:41,625 --> 00:07:43,752
I love you, Chris...

142
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:48,707
like a brother.

143
00:07:49,266 --> 00:07:53,100
- We're friends, right?
- For sure!

144
00:07:55,138 --> 00:07:57,072
You pussy!

145
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:58,698
Shut up, Tim!

146
00:08:00,944 --> 00:08:03,606
Don't you people have anything
better to do?!

147
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,671
God! Just leave
him alone!

148
00:08:07,484 --> 00:08:09,679
You jerks!

149
00:08:09,753 --> 00:08:11,338
I'll show you!

150
00:08:11,588 --> 00:08:13,920
I'll show all of you!

151
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:16,891
This town
is full of losers

152
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,655
and I'm pulling
out to win!

153
00:08:18,728 --> 00:08:20,889
Chris!
Chris, come back!

154
00:08:20,964 --> 00:08:24,365
- My name is Chris Brander!
- Chris, let's talk!

155
00:08:24,434 --> 00:08:26,925
You remember that name!
'Cause I'm gonna be somebody!

156
00:08:52,862 --> 00:08:54,489
I don't know what to say.

157
00:08:54,564 --> 00:08:56,930
I mean,
the sex is good,

158
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,627
but I'm a person too.

159
00:08:58,702 --> 00:09:00,897
I mean, I have
feelings and needs

160
00:09:00,971 --> 00:09:02,370
other than
just physical!

161
00:09:02,439 --> 00:09:05,499
Don't you have anything
to say for yourself?

162
00:09:06,876 --> 00:09:08,810
I think you've pretty much
said it all.

163
00:09:08,878 --> 00:09:11,813
You know what?
This just isn't working out.

164
00:09:11,881 --> 00:09:14,543
Have a great life,
'cause Athena's out!

165
00:09:17,387 --> 00:09:19,617
I don't know why you
just don't take me serious!

166
00:09:25,862 --> 00:09:27,796
I guess Athena's out.

167
00:09:29,032 --> 00:09:30,260
God, can you
believe that?

168
00:09:30,333 --> 00:09:32,267
I get dumped four days
before Christmas.

169
00:09:32,335 --> 00:09:34,269
- I saw.
- Yeah, and yet, you did nothing.

170
00:09:34,337 --> 00:09:35,998
Technically, that makes you
an accomplice.

171
00:09:36,072 --> 00:09:37,539
Guilty as charged.

172
00:09:37,607 --> 00:09:40,235
You know, in some cultures
they'd spank you for that.

173
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:42,335
Oh, I love to travel.

174
00:09:43,647 --> 00:09:45,706
- Chris Brander.
- I'm Mandy.

175
00:09:45,782 --> 00:09:48,478
Of course you are. You know,
I know a song called "Mandy."

176
00:09:48,551 --> 00:09:50,485
Oh!

177
00:09:51,788 --> 00:09:53,517
He shoots, he scores.

178
00:09:56,826 --> 00:09:59,989
- Nice, nice!
- Yeah, Brander! Great job, Brander!

179
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:03,294
You're the bad bunny.
No. No, that's you.

180
00:10:03,366 --> 00:10:05,596
You're the bad bunny.
Yeah.

181
00:10:05,669 --> 00:10:07,398
Okay, that's enough
out of you.

182
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:09,495
Next time you call me,
you call me collect.

183
00:10:09,572 --> 00:10:11,506
Okay. Bye-bye.

184
00:10:11,574 --> 00:10:14,168
- So how'd it go last night?
- Home by 10:00.

185
00:10:14,244 --> 00:10:16,542
Pants off in front
of the computer by 10:01.

186
00:10:16,613 --> 00:10:19,047
Nice. What about Sheila?
Are you making any headway?

187
00:10:19,115 --> 00:10:21,049
We'll see. I'm taking her
to lunch today...

188
00:10:21,117 --> 00:10:23,210
Oh, whoa, whoa whoa.
Don't... don't do that.

189
00:10:23,286 --> 00:10:24,947
- Okay? Don't do lunch.
- Why?

190
00:10:25,021 --> 00:10:27,216
That's like the express lane
to the friend zone.

191
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:29,554
What the hell's
the friend zone?

192
00:10:29,626 --> 00:10:31,787
See when a girl decides
that you're her friend,

193
00:10:31,861 --> 00:10:33,385
you're no longer
a dating option.

194
00:10:33,463 --> 00:10:35,954
You become a complete
non-sexual entity in her eyes,

195
00:10:36,032 --> 00:10:37,795
like her brother.
Or a lamp.

196
00:10:37,867 --> 00:10:39,391
I don't want
to be a lamp.

197
00:10:39,469 --> 00:10:41,596
Yeah. Well, then don't be
her friend, okay?

198
00:10:41,671 --> 00:10:44,799
Oh. Take that guy,
for example.

199
00:10:44,874 --> 00:10:46,899
- You mean that couple?
- No no no.

200
00:10:46,976 --> 00:10:49,570
No, I mean the guy that
wishes they were a couple.

201
00:10:49,646 --> 00:10:51,409
- What is your point?
- My point is...

202
00:10:51,481 --> 00:10:54,211
call Sheila, Ray.
Call her right now.

203
00:10:54,284 --> 00:10:56,115
Move your day date
to tonight.

204
00:10:56,186 --> 00:10:59,087
Play the entire thing aloof and no matter
what you do, kiss her at the end.

205
00:10:59,155 --> 00:11:02,454
- 'Cause friends don't kiss.
- All right. "Aloof."

206
00:11:02,525 --> 00:11:05,050
Hi.

207
00:11:08,631 --> 00:11:10,394
- Straight to voicemail.
- Ouch.

208
00:11:10,467 --> 00:11:13,095
Hope you're not too late.
You may already be girlfriends.

209
00:11:13,169 --> 00:11:16,502
- Really? How will I know?
- Look. It doesn't matter, okay?

210
00:11:16,573 --> 00:11:20,373
If you feel yourself
going there, walk away.

211
00:11:20,443 --> 00:11:22,138
Where'd you come up
with this theory?

212
00:11:22,212 --> 00:11:24,942
Some chick f'd me up
in high school bad.

213
00:11:25,014 --> 00:11:27,312
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

214
00:11:27,384 --> 00:11:28,874
Excuse you!

215
00:11:28,952 --> 00:11:30,544
I saw you flirting
with me out there.

216
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:32,781
How could you do
that to your boyfriend?

217
00:11:32,856 --> 00:11:35,154
Who, him?
We're just friends.

218
00:11:37,861 --> 00:11:40,659
Oh, no no no, I never said that, Lindsay. I
wouldn't do that.

219
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:42,789
No, I'm driving
through a tunnel.

220
00:11:42,866 --> 00:11:45,357
Okay. One second here.
Hey, Francine, you look great.

221
00:11:45,435 --> 00:11:48,802
- Thanks.
- That color really brings out your legs.

222
00:11:48,872 --> 00:11:51,864
Hey, I don't even know you.
Yeah. Ho-ho-ho.

223
00:11:51,941 --> 00:11:53,499
That's great.
Merry Christmas.

224
00:11:53,576 --> 00:11:55,771
I can still see it.
I can still... rub harder!

225
00:11:55,845 --> 00:11:57,437
Don't dab at it!
Rub it.

226
00:11:57,514 --> 00:11:59,675
Rub, rub it, rub it!

227
00:11:59,749 --> 00:12:01,910
Look, honestly, these pants
make me look fat?

228
00:12:01,985 --> 00:12:03,748
- Well...
- You're fired!

229
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:05,685
- What?
- I'm kidding.

230
00:12:05,755 --> 00:12:08,280
Ho-ho-ho! Who's got
a Christmas present?

231
00:12:08,358 --> 00:12:09,916
I do.

232
00:12:09,993 --> 00:12:11,927
How you doing, boss?
Merry Christmas.

233
00:12:11,995 --> 00:12:13,929
- I look fat in these pants?
- Hell no.

234
00:12:13,997 --> 00:12:15,965
Excellent! So you're
seeing your family

235
00:12:16,032 --> 00:12:18,125
- for the holidays.
- Well, as a matter of fact...

236
00:12:18,201 --> 00:12:19,691
- Wait. You want anything?
- No.

237
00:12:19,769 --> 00:12:22,465
Go! Wait.

238
00:12:22,539 --> 00:12:24,439
- Family.
- Parents are separated.

239
00:12:24,507 --> 00:12:26,407
- Jersey's not my idea of a good time, so...
- Fabulous.

240
00:12:26,476 --> 00:12:28,205
- Check this out.
- Yeah. Great. Good.

241
00:12:28,278 --> 00:12:31,543
First up tonight, you've seen
her in the pages of magazines,

242
00:12:31,614 --> 00:12:33,605
and well, the opening
of practically anything,

243
00:12:33,683 --> 00:12:35,844
but what what you may not
know about this "it" girl...

244
00:12:35,919 --> 00:12:37,614
is her humanitarian side.

245
00:12:37,687 --> 00:12:39,245
Hey, everyone.
I'm Samantha James

246
00:12:39,322 --> 00:12:40,755
and I'm here
with Mr. Cluck Cluck

247
00:12:40,824 --> 00:12:42,792
and my new
best friend Wafoofi

248
00:12:42,859 --> 00:12:45,123
and we're part of a kick-ass
humanitarian effort

249
00:12:45,195 --> 00:12:47,857
to help promote vegetarianism
in third world countries,

250
00:12:47,931 --> 00:12:49,592
which is really really
important.

251
00:12:49,666 --> 00:12:52,635
Okay, and speaking of
really really important...

252
00:12:52,702 --> 00:12:55,262
I have some good news.

253
00:12:55,338 --> 00:12:57,067
I've been recording
for my new album

254
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:59,165
which I hope to have out
early next...

255
00:13:00,643 --> 00:13:03,407
- I want that album.
- Hah! What?!

256
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,879
- Samantha James?
- Yeah.

257
00:13:04,948 --> 00:13:06,973
No no no no. Listen to me
very carefully now.

258
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:09,280
Samantha James
is a crazy person.

259
00:13:09,352 --> 00:13:11,445
Hey, you're the one that
used to diddle her, not me.

260
00:13:11,521 --> 00:13:14,581
It was one date!
And I ended up in the hospital.

261
00:13:14,657 --> 00:13:17,148
Have you seen this poster?
Have you seen...

262
00:13:17,227 --> 00:13:18,990
- this poster?
- Yeah, with the fruit.

263
00:13:19,062 --> 00:13:21,724
This is the hottest-selling
poster in the United States.

264
00:13:21,798 --> 00:13:23,789
People love her.
They love her!

265
00:13:23,867 --> 00:13:25,732
Oh, who loves her?

266
00:13:25,802 --> 00:13:28,293
MTV just got her a new
reality show next year.

267
00:13:28,371 --> 00:13:31,863
We time the CD release with the show,
we got a guaranteed hit

268
00:13:31,941 --> 00:13:33,374
plus free promotion.

269
00:13:33,443 --> 00:13:35,968
- She's recording over...
- I know where she's recording.

270
00:13:36,045 --> 00:13:39,242
Good. Good.
Make me happy.

271
00:13:39,315 --> 00:13:41,044
Go away.
Wait. Not you.

272
00:13:41,117 --> 00:13:42,948
Wait!

273
00:13:43,019 --> 00:13:45,988
You don't make me happy, I'm gonna
find somebody else to make me happy.

274
00:13:46,055 --> 00:13:48,455
Loud and clear. Yeah.
Clear as a bell.

275
00:13:48,525 --> 00:13:49,457
- Good.
- Okay.

276
00:13:49,526 --> 00:13:50,993
What are you
still doing here?

277
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:52,254
Go!
Go get me lobster!

278
00:13:52,328 --> 00:13:53,989
Go! Run! Lobster!

279
00:13:54,063 --> 00:13:56,031
Run away! Run!
Daddy want a fish!

280
00:14:01,337 --> 00:14:06,536
# Yeah, uh uh,
eins zwei drei vier! #

281
00:14:06,609 --> 00:14:09,305
# We might be
a world apart #

282
00:14:09,379 --> 00:14:11,506
# World apart #

283
00:14:11,581 --> 00:14:13,481
# But you're always
in my heart #

284
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:15,541
# Always in my heart #

285
00:14:15,618 --> 00:14:18,485
- # When you look up at the stars #
- # Look up at the stars #

286
00:14:18,555 --> 00:14:21,718
- # Feel my love from afar #
- # Afar afar #

287
00:14:21,791 --> 00:14:25,591
- # Looking down like a shining star #
- # Shining star #

288
00:14:25,662 --> 00:14:29,325
- # Dancing free with my guitar #
- # My guitar #

289
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:32,766
- # I don't know just where you are #
- # Where are you? #

290
00:14:32,835 --> 00:14:34,826
# Love from afar,
love from afar #

291
00:14:34,904 --> 00:14:39,204
# Feel my love... #

292
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:43,679
Cut! Cut!

293
00:14:45,181 --> 00:14:48,207
Okay, Ron, which jokester
changed the key on me?

294
00:14:48,284 --> 00:14:49,979
No one, Samantha.

295
00:14:50,053 --> 00:14:52,487
It's been the same key
for the last 43 takes.

296
00:14:52,555 --> 00:14:56,116
Well, something's off then,
because I'm just not feeling it, okay?

297
00:14:56,192 --> 00:14:57,989
God, I need my guitar.

298
00:14:58,061 --> 00:15:00,723
- We need to mix the tracks separately.
- No!

299
00:15:00,797 --> 00:15:05,166
My lyrics say "dancing free
with my guitar," Ron.

300
00:15:05,234 --> 00:15:07,395
So, I'm gonna
be real, okay?

301
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:09,836
I'm not gonna let you
and Hong Kong Phooey up there

302
00:15:09,906 --> 00:15:13,501
turn me into some poppy
bubblegum wannabe.

303
00:15:13,576 --> 00:15:15,544
Okay?
I need to transcend!

304
00:15:15,612 --> 00:15:17,512
Are you guys
even listening to me?

305
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:19,980
# You guys are assholes,
you're assholes... #

306
00:15:20,049 --> 00:15:22,176
- Switch it off, guys.
- # Ron, you're an asshole #

307
00:15:22,251 --> 00:15:25,414
# You guys are assholes,
You're assholes. #

308
00:15:25,488 --> 00:15:27,353
She's all yours.

309
00:15:27,423 --> 00:15:29,687
Chris!

310
00:15:33,496 --> 00:15:36,158
Hey!

311
00:15:36,232 --> 00:15:39,599
I can't hear you, Samantha.
I can't hear you, Samantha.

312
00:15:40,637 --> 00:15:41,729
- Can't hear you.
- Oh.

313
00:15:41,804 --> 00:15:45,672
Oh, light bulb.
There you go.

314
00:15:48,778 --> 00:15:50,905
Oh my God,
I don't believe it!

315
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:53,073
God, I've missed you.

316
00:15:53,149 --> 00:15:55,117
Oh... okay.

317
00:15:58,988 --> 00:16:01,821
Wait a minute. Are you here
because you miss me,

318
00:16:01,891 --> 00:16:04,689
or are you just here because your
boss wants to sign me?

319
00:16:06,396 --> 00:16:08,387
Both?

320
00:16:08,464 --> 00:16:11,262
That's cool.
Guess I missed you too.

321
00:16:12,468 --> 00:16:14,493
God, I want to lick
your skin off!

322
00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:16,629
- I prefer you didn't.
- But I want to.

323
00:16:16,706 --> 00:16:19,072
Don't.

324
00:16:22,345 --> 00:16:24,939
You're gonna get it.
You're gonna get it, baby.

325
00:16:25,014 --> 00:16:28,347
- I don't want it.
- Bad kitty. Meow, meow.

326
00:16:28,418 --> 00:16:30,511
- Okay.
- Oh! Listen, what're you doing

327
00:16:30,586 --> 00:16:32,952
- over the holidays?
- I'm going to Santa Barbara...

328
00:16:33,022 --> 00:16:34,250
'Cause Paris is throwing
a Christmas bash in Paris.

329
00:16:34,323 --> 00:16:35,790
Okay, Paris isn't
gonna work for...

330
00:16:35,858 --> 00:16:37,917
I'm gonna call my assistant
and we're gonna go tonight.

331
00:16:37,994 --> 00:16:40,326
We can work and play.
Mreow.

332
00:16:40,396 --> 00:16:42,694
Oh my God! I just wrote a new song.
You have to hear it!

333
00:16:46,369 --> 00:16:48,132
This one's called
"Forgiveness."

334
00:16:55,411 --> 00:16:57,113
# Forgiveness #

335
00:16:59,849 --> 00:17:02,943
# Is more than
saying sorry #

336
00:17:07,557 --> 00:17:10,321
# To forgive is divine #

337
00:17:10,393 --> 00:17:13,453
# So let's have
a glass of wine #

338
00:17:13,529 --> 00:17:16,293
# And have makeup sex #

339
00:17:16,365 --> 00:17:17,832
# Until the end of #

340
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:20,960
# Time time time time #

341
00:17:21,037 --> 00:17:24,905
# Time #

342
00:17:24,974 --> 00:17:26,703
# Time. #

343
00:17:28,544 --> 00:17:30,808
So what did you
you think?

344
00:17:33,049 --> 00:17:35,745
I mean, my God!

345
00:17:35,818 --> 00:17:37,911
Oh my God,
you're sweet.

346
00:17:39,222 --> 00:17:41,747
- What is that?
- This is a taser gun.

347
00:17:41,824 --> 00:17:44,224
My publicist gave it to me
to ward off stalkers.

348
00:17:48,445 --> 00:17:50,032
Tuna.

349
00:17:50,099 --> 00:17:52,897
- You want some?
- I'll pass.

350
00:17:55,371 --> 00:17:58,135
I'm so glad
KC got us back together.

351
00:17:58,207 --> 00:17:59,970
Yeah, you're awful.

352
00:18:00,294 --> 00:18:02,602
I have a great idea.

353
00:18:02,678 --> 00:18:04,942
What if on our way to Paris
we stop off in Ireland

354
00:18:05,014 --> 00:18:06,845
and find out
where U2 lives?

355
00:18:06,916 --> 00:18:09,783
What if we got someone
like Bono to sing backup?

356
00:18:09,852 --> 00:18:11,911
I'd be all...
# Forgiveness is the way, #

357
00:18:11,988 --> 00:18:15,185
and he'd go, # Forgiveness every day #
only all Bono-y.

358
00:18:15,258 --> 00:18:17,249
Wouldn't that
be amazing?

359
00:18:17,326 --> 00:18:20,124
What if I added
more vibrato?

360
00:18:20,196 --> 00:18:23,165
# Forgiveness #

361
00:18:24,901 --> 00:18:28,029
# Is more than
sayin' sorry #

362
00:18:31,974 --> 00:18:35,705
# To forgive is divine #

363
00:18:35,778 --> 00:18:37,871
# So let's have
a glass of... #

364
00:18:40,149 --> 00:18:42,845
Okay. Who's the genius
behind this?

365
00:18:42,919 --> 00:18:45,217
The container said
"microwavable."

366
00:18:45,288 --> 00:18:46,812
But the aluminum
foil wasn't.

367
00:18:46,889 --> 00:18:49,414
Well, I'm not supposed to worry
about stuff like that.

368
00:18:49,492 --> 00:18:50,925
I'm the talent.

369
00:18:50,993 --> 00:18:53,325
Daddy, we're down.

370
00:18:53,396 --> 00:18:55,330
Not exactly warm
out here, is it?

371
00:18:55,398 --> 00:18:58,390
- How long till we're airborne again?
- Nice plane!

372
00:18:58,467 --> 00:19:01,061
- Not till tomorrow.
- Terrific. Where are we?

373
00:19:01,137 --> 00:19:02,729
Not happy!

374
00:19:02,805 --> 00:19:05,569
We're on a private field
an hour outside of Trenton.

375
00:19:05,641 --> 00:19:08,576
Jersey?
We're in New Jersey?

376
00:19:08,644 --> 00:19:11,613
Hey, wait a minute.
Am I being Punk'd?

377
00:19:11,681 --> 00:19:13,581
Where's Ashton?
Ha!

378
00:19:13,649 --> 00:19:14,616
Ashton!

379
00:19:14,684 --> 00:19:16,618
Oh my God!
Ha ha.

380
00:19:16,686 --> 00:19:18,620
You totally got me!

381
00:19:18,688 --> 00:19:20,451
Ashton?

382
00:19:22,592 --> 00:19:25,152
I love it that you're taking me home
to meet your mom.

383
00:19:25,228 --> 00:19:27,162
Was this one of your
clever little plans?

384
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:29,494
Yes. I planned you
setting the plane on fire.

385
00:19:30,633 --> 00:19:33,534
Surprise!

386
00:19:38,207 --> 00:19:40,767
Oh, my little boy.

387
00:19:44,513 --> 00:19:46,447
Be right down.

388
00:20:34,063 --> 00:20:36,395
I do not remember
Jersey being this cold.

389
00:20:36,465 --> 00:20:38,865
Well, it's been uncommonly
cold this month.

390
00:20:38,935 --> 00:20:42,234
We've gone through
seven bags of rock salt.

391
00:20:42,305 --> 00:20:43,966
Your house is just
so quaint, Mrs. Brander,

392
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:46,531
I mean, Chris, you never told me
you were so provincial.

393
00:20:46,609 --> 00:20:48,873
It's like a true
rags to riches story,

394
00:20:48,945 --> 00:20:51,539
but I've always found the middle class to
be just so much more real.

395
00:20:53,049 --> 00:20:55,313
I mean, isn't Chris great?

396
00:20:55,384 --> 00:20:57,318
Yeah, he is a nice boy.

397
00:20:57,386 --> 00:21:00,685
You know, he usually
flies us out to Los Angeles.

398
00:21:00,756 --> 00:21:02,690
It's been...

399
00:21:02,758 --> 00:21:05,056
oh, nine, 10...

400
00:21:05,127 --> 00:21:07,220
- It's 10 years. Yeah.
- 10?

401
00:21:07,296 --> 00:21:09,628
10 years
since he's been home.

402
00:21:09,699 --> 00:21:12,224
- All right. Good job, Dougie.
- Oh, hi, honey!

403
00:21:15,271 --> 00:21:16,966
Oh my God.

404
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:20,031
- Mikey.
- Oh my God!

405
00:21:21,644 --> 00:21:24,841
- Is that my Christmas present?
- Sam, my younger brother Mike.

406
00:21:24,914 --> 00:21:27,576
- Samantha James.
- Samantha James.

407
00:21:27,650 --> 00:21:29,914
Mike Brander.
It is an honor.

408
00:21:29,986 --> 00:21:32,284
I have your poster
on my wall,

409
00:21:32,355 --> 00:21:35,688
- but you are way hotter in person.
- I know!

410
00:21:35,758 --> 00:21:38,226
- You have her poster on your wall?
- Yeah.

411
00:21:38,294 --> 00:21:40,353
I slapped the ham
to it like an hour ago.

412
00:21:40,429 --> 00:21:42,397
What ham did you slap?

413
00:21:42,465 --> 00:21:44,990
Not the ham
that I just bought?

414
00:21:45,067 --> 00:21:48,127
Oh, Mrs. Brander, do you have
anything else besides ham?

415
00:21:48,204 --> 00:21:49,899
Because I'm on
the Perricone diet

416
00:21:49,972 --> 00:21:51,803
and I need salmon
like now.

417
00:21:51,874 --> 00:21:55,366
I love salmon. It's the prettiest
color for bedrooms.

418
00:21:55,444 --> 00:21:58,436
- So relaxing.
- I'm gonna start drinking.

419
00:21:58,514 --> 00:22:00,573
Um, does anybody want anything?
Some coffee?

420
00:22:00,649 --> 00:22:02,241
Maybe some salmon
or something?

421
00:22:02,318 --> 00:22:04,252
Just gonna...

422
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,912
yeah.

423
00:22:05,988 --> 00:22:07,751
Mike! Good to be home.

424
00:22:15,931 --> 00:22:19,594
Oh, boy. Okay.

425
00:22:19,668 --> 00:22:23,126
Hi. Yes, I know,
very exciting.

426
00:22:23,205 --> 00:22:25,799
Hi. Hi.

427
00:22:25,875 --> 00:22:27,809
Oh. Chris,
let's get it to go.

428
00:22:27,877 --> 00:22:29,970
People are staring at me.

429
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:33,414
Oh my God...
plastic menus!

430
00:22:33,482 --> 00:22:36,212
Well, this isn't gonna work,
is it now, Chris?

431
00:22:36,285 --> 00:22:37,252
Chris?

432
00:22:40,389 --> 00:22:42,323
Excuse me, but I was
wondering if you think

433
00:22:42,391 --> 00:22:44,450
America will ever switch
to the metric system?

434
00:22:44,527 --> 00:22:46,324
Well, that's
a very interesting...

435
00:22:47,930 --> 00:22:51,457
- Oh my God! Chris!
- I don't believe this!

436
00:22:51,534 --> 00:22:54,731
- Oh! God, you look great!
- I don't... you look great!

437
00:22:54,804 --> 00:22:57,329
- Well, thank you! How you been?
- We're married.

438
00:22:57,406 --> 00:22:59,465
- You're married!
- Married?

439
00:22:59,542 --> 00:23:02,102
- Yeah, we're married, we got a kid. TJ.
- We have a son. TJ.

440
00:23:02,178 --> 00:23:04,305
- TJ!
- He looks like me. He's got Clark's eyes...

441
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:06,348
Oh my God!
Where does the time go?

442
00:23:06,415 --> 00:23:08,975
He's like the creative mind kid, he's like,
brilliant and you can meet him.

443
00:23:09,051 --> 00:23:11,611
- That's great!
- God, look at those teeth!

444
00:23:11,687 --> 00:23:13,552
Those are some nice veneers
you got, my friend.

445
00:23:13,622 --> 00:23:15,590
- Don't tell me that you're a dentist.
- A dentist?

446
00:23:15,658 --> 00:23:19,389
- I totally sold out, dude.
- Hey, you and me both, buddy.

447
00:23:19,462 --> 00:23:22,226
Lover, aren't you
gonna introduce me?

448
00:23:22,298 --> 00:23:23,890
Yes!

449
00:23:23,966 --> 00:23:25,695
Samantha, these are
my old friends.

450
00:23:25,768 --> 00:23:27,929
This is Clark,
this is Darla.

451
00:23:28,003 --> 00:23:31,029
Your names are
"Clark" and "Darla"?

452
00:23:31,107 --> 00:23:32,233
Yeah.

453
00:23:32,308 --> 00:23:35,004
Oh my God,
that is so cute!

454
00:23:35,077 --> 00:23:37,170
I just wanna
eat you both up!

455
00:23:38,914 --> 00:23:41,849
Okay, I am gonna go
to the little girl's room.

456
00:23:41,917 --> 00:23:43,817
- Good.
- And then we're outie.

457
00:23:43,886 --> 00:23:46,616
- Okay.
- Okay.

458
00:23:46,689 --> 00:23:49,590
She's... incoming.

459
00:23:49,658 --> 00:23:51,455
Oh my God.

460
00:23:51,527 --> 00:23:53,961
Check out that
girl's ass. Huge!

461
00:23:55,364 --> 00:23:57,389
It was so nice
meeting you.

462
00:24:01,669 --> 00:24:02,748
Darla.

463
00:24:06,475 --> 00:24:08,568
She's adorable.

464
00:24:08,644 --> 00:24:10,874
- And affectionate.
- Christ sakes.

465
00:24:10,946 --> 00:24:13,972
- Chris Brander, ladies and gentlemen!
- Yes! You guys, so good...

466
00:24:14,049 --> 00:24:16,381
Chris Brander?
Chris Brander?

467
00:24:16,452 --> 00:24:17,976
Holy...

468
00:24:18,053 --> 00:24:21,784
I saw you at the Grammys
sitting next to P. Diddy!

469
00:24:22,825 --> 00:24:24,520
It's me Tim.
You remember?

470
00:24:24,593 --> 00:24:25,924
Oh, how could I
forget you, Tim?

471
00:24:25,995 --> 00:24:27,929
Hey, you got $5

472
00:24:27,997 --> 00:24:30,124
that I can,
like, have?

473
00:24:31,167 --> 00:24:33,135
Yeah.

474
00:24:33,202 --> 00:24:34,931
You keep
living the dream, Tim.

475
00:24:35,004 --> 00:24:35,902
Done!

476
00:24:35,971 --> 00:24:37,063
Buh-bye now.

477
00:24:37,139 --> 00:24:40,108
- Class of '95!
- Class of '95!

478
00:24:40,176 --> 00:24:41,905
Here's your money,
bitch!

479
00:24:41,977 --> 00:24:44,207
- He looks good.
- Man, I can't believe...

480
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:46,441
wha... like what happened?
Where did you go?

481
00:24:46,515 --> 00:24:49,348
Hey, you know...
just migrated west.

482
00:24:49,518 --> 00:24:52,009
You know, I'm living
the dream out there, I guess.

483
00:24:52,087 --> 00:24:54,146
I just stayed with my dad
for awhile, and...

484
00:24:54,223 --> 00:24:57,590
yeah, hocked my soul
for a record executive job...

485
00:24:57,660 --> 00:25:00,754
and started...
I mean I had an internship first

486
00:25:00,829 --> 00:25:02,262
- a couple of years.
- Right.

487
00:25:04,733 --> 00:25:07,099
Jamie.

488
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:12,607
Jamie?

489
00:25:13,976 --> 00:25:16,604
- Chris, hi!
- Hi!

490
00:25:16,679 --> 00:25:19,580
What are you
doing down there?

491
00:25:19,648 --> 00:25:22,515
Oh, I'm just busted!

492
00:25:22,585 --> 00:25:26,180
How are you?
Oh, shit. Hold on.

493
00:25:29,225 --> 00:25:30,954
Look at you!

494
00:25:31,026 --> 00:25:32,653
Oh my God,

495
00:25:32,728 --> 00:25:35,060
I can put my
arms around you.

496
00:25:36,865 --> 00:25:39,493
- You look so great! Look at this body!
- Thank you.

497
00:25:39,568 --> 00:25:41,297
- You're like a new man!
- Yeah.

498
00:25:41,370 --> 00:25:44,339
These arms
and your belly,

499
00:25:44,406 --> 00:25:46,397
and look at...
pecs, and...

500
00:25:46,979 --> 00:25:49,035
Chris Brander.

501
00:25:49,111 --> 00:25:52,012
God.
Jamie Palamino.

502
00:25:55,150 --> 00:25:57,983
So, um... so how long
are you in town for?

503
00:25:58,053 --> 00:26:00,180
Um, just the night,
actually.

504
00:26:00,256 --> 00:26:02,520
Just one night, really?
You can't stay any longer?

505
00:26:02,591 --> 00:26:05,754
No. I wish I could, but l...

506
00:26:05,828 --> 00:26:07,796
Let's go, Chris.
There's pee on the floor.

507
00:26:10,566 --> 00:26:14,024
- Yeah.
- Okay...

508
00:26:14,103 --> 00:26:16,731
all right, well...

509
00:26:16,805 --> 00:26:20,366
- it's really great to see you again.
- You too.

510
00:26:27,716 --> 00:26:29,581
Just give me
a call sometime.

511
00:26:29,652 --> 00:26:31,677
I'm living
with my parents.

512
00:26:31,754 --> 00:26:34,655
Oh, I know.
I'm living with my parents.

513
00:26:36,058 --> 00:26:37,787
Okay, bye.

514
00:26:39,061 --> 00:26:41,029
- Bye.
- Bye.

515
00:26:43,532 --> 00:26:46,592
- Jamie Pal.
- Whoa!

516
00:26:46,669 --> 00:26:48,102
She's like a box
of fine wine.

517
00:26:48,170 --> 00:26:50,866
You would know.

518
00:26:50,939 --> 00:26:53,601
You know, in high school
you'd never get a girl like that.

519
00:26:53,676 --> 00:26:55,644
And now you get
whoever you want.

520
00:26:57,713 --> 00:27:00,409
I bet you could
definitely hit Jamie Pal.

521
00:27:00,482 --> 00:27:02,950
- Definitely.
- Okay. Okay.

522
00:27:07,890 --> 00:27:09,585
- Excuse me.
- Oh yeah.

523
00:27:09,658 --> 00:27:11,888
You go! Whoo!

524
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:14,190
- Hey!
- Hey!

525
00:27:14,263 --> 00:27:17,562
Look, there is a chance that my
flight might be delayed an extra day.

526
00:27:17,633 --> 00:27:20,101
- What are you doing tomorrow?
- Um, nothing.

527
00:27:20,169 --> 00:27:22,865
- Do you want to meet for lunch?
- You mean like a day date?

528
00:27:22,938 --> 00:27:24,872
Yeah.

529
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:26,407
Great!

530
00:27:26,475 --> 00:27:28,409
Chris! Chris!

531
00:27:28,477 --> 00:27:30,945
- I'll pick you up at noon.
- Chris! Chris!

532
00:27:31,013 --> 00:27:34,176
- Chris! Chris! Chris!
- Awesome, I'm really...

533
00:27:34,249 --> 00:27:37,480
- I'm busy!
- I'm busy! Stupid dick!

534
00:27:37,553 --> 00:27:40,317
- That sounds awesome. I'll see you then.
- Bye.

535
00:27:42,624 --> 00:27:44,489
Let's go.

536
00:27:46,362 --> 00:27:47,829
- What was that all about?
- Nothing.

537
00:27:47,896 --> 00:27:49,488
It's just an old
friend saying hi.

538
00:27:49,565 --> 00:27:51,499
Yeah, well, let's
keep it that way.

539
00:27:51,567 --> 00:27:54,468
- It's not a handball.
- My handball.

540
00:27:54,536 --> 00:27:56,970
Meow. Meow.

541
00:28:06,014 --> 00:28:10,075
# I used to know you
when we were young #

542
00:28:10,152 --> 00:28:13,553
# You were
in all my dreams #

543
00:28:13,622 --> 00:28:18,252
# We sat together
in period one #

544
00:28:18,327 --> 00:28:21,296
# Fridays at 8:15... #

545
00:28:21,363 --> 00:28:25,322
- Whoa.
- # But I will wait for you #

546
00:28:25,401 --> 00:28:29,770
# As long as I need to #

547
00:28:29,838 --> 00:28:34,332
# And if you ever get
back to Hackensack #

548
00:28:34,410 --> 00:28:40,144
# I'll be here for you. #

549
00:28:45,487 --> 00:28:50,982
# Jesus Christ our savior
was born upon this day #

550
00:28:51,059 --> 00:28:53,994
# To save us all
from Satan's power #

551
00:28:54,062 --> 00:28:56,690
# When we were
gone astray #

552
00:28:56,765 --> 00:28:58,232
# Oh, tidings... #

553
00:28:58,300 --> 00:28:59,699
Hey! Dumb-ass.

554
00:29:00,736 --> 00:29:01,930
Wake up.

555
00:29:02,004 --> 00:29:03,464
Hey, wake up.

556
00:29:04,006 --> 00:29:05,530
Morning.

557
00:29:08,610 --> 00:29:10,100
Agh! What?

558
00:29:10,179 --> 00:29:11,806
I need you to
do me a favor.

559
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,814
What do you
want from me?!

560
00:29:13,882 --> 00:29:15,577
I ran into Jamie Palomino
last night.

561
00:29:15,651 --> 00:29:17,642
Oh, here we go again.

562
00:29:17,719 --> 00:29:19,983
I'm not the same person
I was in high-school, pal.

563
00:29:20,055 --> 00:29:21,716
You'll always be fat
to me, Chris.

564
00:29:21,790 --> 00:29:24,020
What do you want from me?!

565
00:29:24,092 --> 00:29:26,560
I need you
to detain Samantha.

566
00:29:26,628 --> 00:29:28,186
I could do that.

567
00:29:28,530 --> 00:29:31,829
- Chris, wait!
- It's a beautiful day.

568
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:33,959
What about Paris?

569
00:29:34,036 --> 00:29:36,800
Look, Paris can wait. This is important.
You don't wanna be

570
00:29:36,872 --> 00:29:38,931
- out of touch with your audience, do you?
- No.

571
00:29:39,007 --> 00:29:40,907
No, well then, you need
to connect with your audience,

572
00:29:40,976 --> 00:29:42,307
you need to feed off their energy.

573
00:29:42,377 --> 00:29:44,777
After all, they're the ones who're
gonna be buying your album.

574
00:29:44,847 --> 00:29:46,781
The problem is where
in New Jersey are we gonna find

575
00:29:46,849 --> 00:29:48,976
a proper cross-section
of your fans?

576
00:29:50,352 --> 00:29:52,445
- The mall?
- A mall!

577
00:29:52,521 --> 00:29:54,045
That's a great idea!

578
00:29:55,624 --> 00:29:57,524
- We have so much in common!
- I know!

579
00:29:57,593 --> 00:29:59,527
- God.
- Let's do it to it!

580
00:29:59,595 --> 00:30:01,358
Whoa! I am not
going with him!

581
00:30:01,430 --> 00:30:04,524
Look, what better way to relate
to your fans than to go with one?

582
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:06,568
In we go.

583
00:30:07,013 --> 00:30:09,069
You're not coming with me?

584
00:30:09,305 --> 00:30:11,503
No, sweetie.
You need to do this alone.

585
00:30:11,573 --> 00:30:13,234
- I can't be your crutch.
- But l...

586
00:30:13,308 --> 00:30:14,741
Watch your face!

587
00:30:14,810 --> 00:30:16,641
Buckle up!

588
00:30:22,784 --> 00:30:24,752
Great.
That's good.

589
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:26,378
That's looking good.

590
00:30:30,092 --> 00:30:32,993
Great, guys.
Really good.

591
00:30:35,097 --> 00:30:37,429
Mr. Palamino,
how you doing?

592
00:30:37,499 --> 00:30:39,330
Well well well,

593
00:30:39,401 --> 00:30:42,564
if it isn't
Mr. Valentine's Day!

594
00:30:42,638 --> 00:30:45,971
This guy, every Valentine's Day,
he'd buy Jamie like a dozen roses.

595
00:30:46,041 --> 00:30:48,839
Used to drive all
her boyfriends nuts!

596
00:30:48,911 --> 00:30:51,812
Ha! Till we explained, of course,
it was just her little friend Chris.

597
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:53,848
Yeah,
I remember that.

598
00:30:53,916 --> 00:30:56,282
You prick.

599
00:30:56,351 --> 00:30:59,252
I see you still have the best
Christmas display in town, sir.

600
00:30:59,321 --> 00:31:01,482
- Hey! In the state!
- Hey, Chris!

601
00:31:01,557 --> 00:31:03,184
I'll be right out.

602
00:31:03,258 --> 00:31:06,091
So, how'd you
lose all that weight?

603
00:31:06,161 --> 00:31:08,755
Like that retard
from Subway?

604
00:31:08,830 --> 00:31:10,263
It was great
talking to you, sir.

605
00:31:12,701 --> 00:31:14,635
Are you kidding me?

606
00:31:14,703 --> 00:31:16,637
I rented the nicest Porsche
in New Jersey.

607
00:31:16,705 --> 00:31:18,434
I'm just gonna play
this whole thing aloof

608
00:31:18,507 --> 00:31:20,839
and she's gonna be eating out
of the palm of my hand in no time.

609
00:31:20,909 --> 00:31:23,002
Gotta go.

610
00:31:24,913 --> 00:31:28,371
Porsche.
Girls must love this.

611
00:31:28,450 --> 00:31:31,078
I hate this stupid thing too.
It's a rental.

612
00:31:31,153 --> 00:31:34,088
So ostentatious.
It's all they had left.

613
00:31:39,394 --> 00:31:42,386
- God, this place hasn't changed a bit.
- I know.

614
00:31:42,464 --> 00:31:44,455
Are you sure that you don't want
to go someplace else?

615
00:31:44,533 --> 00:31:47,661
- No, we can't leave. We have history here.
- History.

616
00:31:47,736 --> 00:31:51,604
Oh my goodness,
I remember you two.

617
00:31:51,673 --> 00:31:54,801
Oh, you're not
a chubby bunny anymore.

618
00:31:54,876 --> 00:31:57,902
- Oh, my personal space.
- I'll be right back.

619
00:31:57,980 --> 00:32:00,881
I've got a little
surprise for you.

620
00:32:00,949 --> 00:32:03,213
Can't wait.

621
00:32:03,285 --> 00:32:04,752
Haha!
Chubby bunny!

622
00:32:05,072 --> 00:32:07,584
Thanks for
reminding me I was fat.

623
00:32:09,524 --> 00:32:11,583
So why did you disappear
on me 10 years ago?

624
00:32:12,828 --> 00:32:15,058
Listen, about that...

625
00:32:15,130 --> 00:32:16,688
Where you
that mad at me?

626
00:32:16,765 --> 00:32:20,064
Come on, Jamie. It was like
100 years ago, all right?

627
00:32:20,135 --> 00:32:22,501
I'm not that pathetic
little dweeb anymore.

628
00:32:22,571 --> 00:32:26,234
You were never
a dweeb, Chris.

629
00:32:26,308 --> 00:32:29,277
- So, tell me about your job.
- Oh my God.

630
00:32:29,344 --> 00:32:31,676
You know, once you get over
all the glamour, you know, it's...

631
00:32:31,747 --> 00:32:33,510
it's nothing but total insanity.

632
00:32:33,582 --> 00:32:36,142
You know, if it's not Pink calling you,
then you got Good Charlotte...

633
00:32:36,218 --> 00:32:39,517
it's Jay Z's birthday party, you know, and
I'm totally name-dropping right now

634
00:32:39,588 --> 00:32:42,113
and I'd really like to stop.
Mick Jagger. How 'bout you?

635
00:32:42,190 --> 00:32:44,852
You know, what happened to you?
How'd you end up working at The Maple?

636
00:32:44,926 --> 00:32:46,791
I don't work
at The Maple.

637
00:32:46,862 --> 00:32:49,387
I mean, I work at The Maple
but I don't really work at The Maple.

638
00:32:49,464 --> 00:32:51,056
- Yeah.
- I'm studying to be a teacher

639
00:32:51,133 --> 00:32:52,623
so I'm living at home
and I'm working...

640
00:32:52,701 --> 00:32:54,965
It's the coast.
Be right back.

641
00:32:58,073 --> 00:33:00,200
What happened to him?

642
00:33:00,542 --> 00:33:02,874
# Five golden rings #

643
00:33:02,944 --> 00:33:05,811
- # Four calling birds #
- I don't care what your mommy said.

644
00:33:05,881 --> 00:33:08,008
# Three French hens,
two turtle doves #

645
00:33:08,083 --> 00:33:09,573
Oh, this is gonna be a great song.
"Mall People."

646
00:33:09,651 --> 00:33:11,676
"Mall people,
they come and go...

647
00:33:11,753 --> 00:33:13,721
small people,
they just don't know."

648
00:33:13,789 --> 00:33:16,349
- How's it goin'?
- Fantastic.

649
00:33:16,425 --> 00:33:17,892
- How's it going with Jamie?
- Treating her like

650
00:33:17,959 --> 00:33:20,291
- every boyfriend she's ever had.
- You da man!

651
00:33:20,362 --> 00:33:22,694
- So I wanna run an idea by you.
- No.

652
00:33:22,764 --> 00:33:26,097
Since you're trying to hook up with Jamie,
what if I went to Paris with Samantha

653
00:33:26,168 --> 00:33:27,863
- instead of you? That way you...
- No.

654
00:33:27,936 --> 00:33:29,494
- You haven't heard the whole thing yet!
- No.

655
00:33:29,571 --> 00:33:31,835
You know what, just... just think
about it and get back to me.

656
00:33:36,211 --> 00:33:39,112
- Oh my God!
- I gotta go.

657
00:33:45,420 --> 00:33:47,752
- So, how's the coast?
- Super.

658
00:33:47,823 --> 00:33:50,121
Here we go!

659
00:33:50,192 --> 00:33:52,820
One grilled cheese
with ranch on the side

660
00:33:52,894 --> 00:33:57,092
and one Sugar Mountain Supreme
for the chubby bunny.

661
00:33:57,165 --> 00:33:59,725
Excuse me, um,

662
00:33:59,801 --> 00:34:01,962
this-this... this isn't
gonna work for me.

663
00:34:02,037 --> 00:34:04,631
But this is what
you always order.

664
00:34:04,706 --> 00:34:07,641
Yeah. 10 years ago,
when I was a whale.

665
00:34:07,709 --> 00:34:10,473
The pancakes are fine.
He's just kidding.

666
00:34:10,545 --> 00:34:12,137
What?

667
00:34:13,815 --> 00:34:16,807
- Be more rude!
- She's rude! She's rude!

668
00:34:16,885 --> 00:34:19,217
I haven't had sweets
in 10 years, okay? Do you know

669
00:34:19,287 --> 00:34:21,721
- what this would do to my stomach?
- Relax, little girl.

670
00:34:21,790 --> 00:34:24,782
I'll have the pancakes and you
can have my sandwich, okay?

671
00:34:25,994 --> 00:34:28,394
I'll just enjoy
this glass of water.

672
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:32,962
I'm stuffed.

673
00:34:39,074 --> 00:34:41,941
Good times.
Good times!

674
00:34:42,010 --> 00:34:43,477
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

675
00:34:43,545 --> 00:34:45,536
- Thanks again for lunch.
- Oh, I'll get your door.

676
00:34:45,614 --> 00:34:47,639
Oh. Okay.

677
00:34:47,716 --> 00:34:49,149
Shit.

678
00:34:54,389 --> 00:34:56,357
- Whew!
- Yeah.

679
00:34:58,727 --> 00:35:01,093
Well, it was great
seeing you again.

680
00:35:01,163 --> 00:35:02,596
You too.

681
00:35:02,664 --> 00:35:04,063
Yeah, glad I ran
into you last night.

682
00:35:04,132 --> 00:35:06,066
Yeah, it was
a surprise.

683
00:35:06,134 --> 00:35:08,068
Big surprise.
Yeah.

684
00:35:08,136 --> 00:35:09,728
It's cold out here.

685
00:35:09,805 --> 00:35:11,739
Yeah, it is.
It's like the South Pole.

686
00:35:11,807 --> 00:35:14,571
It's like the deep South Pole
if there was one.

687
00:35:14,643 --> 00:35:16,372
There isn't, though.

688
00:35:16,444 --> 00:35:18,105
Um, thanks for walking
me to my door.

689
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:21,013
Yeah. Again, it was
great seeing you...

690
00:35:21,082 --> 00:35:22,049
again.

691
00:35:22,117 --> 00:35:23,880
- You, too.
- Yeah.

692
00:35:23,952 --> 00:35:26,250
Take care.

693
00:35:26,321 --> 00:35:28,551
Yeah, you too.

694
00:35:31,126 --> 00:35:32,889
- Oh.
- That's good.

695
00:35:36,765 --> 00:35:39,097
- Take care.
- You too.

696
00:36:03,525 --> 00:36:06,790
Stupid! Stupid!
Stupid!

697
00:36:06,862 --> 00:36:08,727
What the hell?!

698
00:36:11,766 --> 00:36:13,700
God!

699
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:20,003
Oh my God!

700
00:36:20,075 --> 00:36:22,703
It's the South Pole!
It's the deep South Pole?

701
00:36:22,777 --> 00:36:24,768
It's the South Pole.
The deep South Pole!

702
00:36:24,846 --> 00:36:26,871
I don't think there is one,
but if there was one

703
00:36:26,948 --> 00:36:29,007
I bet it would be
in the south!

704
00:36:38,393 --> 00:36:41,487
- I left my gloves in the car.
- Oh.

705
00:36:48,203 --> 00:36:49,670
- There you go.
- Thanks.

706
00:37:01,917 --> 00:37:03,714
Hey, look who's here!
What's up, Hollywood?

707
00:37:03,785 --> 00:37:05,446
- How the big date go?
- It was terrible.

708
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,852
I went in for a kiss,
but she wants a hug, okay?

709
00:37:07,923 --> 00:37:10,483
Then I get caught in a sort
of kiss-hug limbo type thing.

710
00:37:10,558 --> 00:37:14,426
I don't know what that is, then I
ended up shaking her entire body.

711
00:37:14,496 --> 00:37:17,158
So y-you gave her
a body shake?

712
00:37:17,232 --> 00:37:20,690
Oh, God! I should've just kissed her!
What am I doing?

713
00:37:20,769 --> 00:37:23,260
It looks like you picked up right
where you left off.

714
00:37:23,338 --> 00:37:24,896
You're back
in the friend zone.

715
00:37:25,941 --> 00:37:27,431
Oh, f-f...

716
00:37:42,123 --> 00:37:44,057
What?

717
00:37:44,125 --> 00:37:45,854
Little problem.

718
00:37:46,161 --> 00:37:48,857
Okay, she's got
a bit of a headache.

719
00:37:48,930 --> 00:37:51,057
It's not that bad. Ha!

720
00:37:52,901 --> 00:37:53,959
Oh my God!

721
00:37:54,035 --> 00:37:56,435
What the hell
happened to her?

722
00:37:56,504 --> 00:37:58,870
Long story short,
she fell.

723
00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:00,771
Samantha, are you okay?

724
00:38:00,842 --> 00:38:02,503
I'm gonna make bubble.

725
00:38:02,577 --> 00:38:04,340
Dude, she's fine!

726
00:38:04,412 --> 00:38:07,210
Look at her. She's having a good time.
She's got her toothpaste.

727
00:38:07,282 --> 00:38:10,183
All you had to do was watch her for a few
hours. What did you do to her?

728
00:38:10,251 --> 00:38:13,015
Nothing! She's just all
loopy from all the Vicodin.

729
00:38:13,088 --> 00:38:15,249
Where did you
get the Vicodin?

730
00:38:15,323 --> 00:38:17,291
Mom.

731
00:38:17,359 --> 00:38:19,156
Blueberry!

732
00:38:19,227 --> 00:38:21,593
Okay.
I'm gonna kill you.

733
00:38:21,663 --> 00:38:23,392
What?!
You said detain her!

734
00:38:23,465 --> 00:38:25,490
- You're a dead man, Mike!
- She's detained!

735
00:38:27,168 --> 00:38:28,829
Eww.

736
00:38:28,903 --> 00:38:30,370
- My balls!
- Oh.

737
00:38:32,507 --> 00:38:34,839
You're dead.

738
00:38:34,909 --> 00:38:36,843
No, Chris! No!

739
00:38:36,911 --> 00:38:38,845
Chris...

740
00:38:38,913 --> 00:38:40,642
Chris, no!

741
00:38:42,317 --> 00:38:43,909
- My boss! Truce!
- Truce!

742
00:38:43,985 --> 00:38:45,612
- Truce!
- Okay.

743
00:38:45,687 --> 00:38:46,676
- Hello?
- Nyah!

744
00:38:46,755 --> 00:38:48,620
Hey, Chrissy!

745
00:38:48,690 --> 00:38:50,624
How's my future star doing?

746
00:38:50,692 --> 00:38:52,319
Great.
She's doing great, sir.

747
00:38:52,394 --> 00:38:54,624
So let me... let me...
let me say hi to her.

748
00:38:54,696 --> 00:38:56,891
She's a little incapacitated
at the moment.

749
00:38:56,965 --> 00:39:00,059
Oh, a little incapacitated,
that's my baby, that's my boy!

750
00:39:00,135 --> 00:39:03,935
Look, when you two get back, I've got this
incredible marketing campaign

751
00:39:04,005 --> 00:39:06,633
lined up for the spring quarter.
Our number one priority:

752
00:39:06,708 --> 00:39:09,973
- Samantha James!
- Awesome.

753
00:39:10,045 --> 00:39:12,775
Three two, one!

754
00:39:12,847 --> 00:39:15,782
Ho-ho-ho.

755
00:39:15,850 --> 00:39:19,149
- Yeah-ha-ha! Yeah!
- Merry Christmas!

756
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:21,313
It's a Palamino Christmas!

757
00:39:21,389 --> 00:39:23,357
Again!

758
00:39:26,127 --> 00:39:28,061
- Hello?
- Jamie.

759
00:39:28,129 --> 00:39:30,324
- Hey.
- What's up?

760
00:39:30,398 --> 00:39:33,299
Listen, you're never gonna believe this,
but I can't get a flight out.

761
00:39:33,368 --> 00:39:35,632
- I'm stuck here another day.
- Oh.

762
00:39:35,703 --> 00:39:37,193
I want to apologize
for earlier.

763
00:39:37,272 --> 00:39:38,762
- Let me make it up to you.
- I taste good.

764
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:40,808
Do you want to go
ice skating?

765
00:39:40,875 --> 00:39:43,366
- I thought you hated ice skating.
- I used to,

766
00:39:43,445 --> 00:39:46,346
but you know, I'm actually
pretty damn good now.

767
00:39:46,414 --> 00:39:47,676
I'm the MVP
in my league, in fact.

768
00:39:47,749 --> 00:39:49,944
Come on, it'll be
like old times.

769
00:39:51,486 --> 00:39:54,421
- Hello, Joyce?
- Mom? I'm on the phone.

770
00:39:54,489 --> 00:39:58,186
Oh! Well, Chris, what are you
doing over at Joyce's?

771
00:39:58,259 --> 00:40:01,092
No, Mom. I'm in the living room,
10 feet away from you

772
00:40:01,162 --> 00:40:02,993
- and I'm on the phone.
- Oh.

773
00:40:03,064 --> 00:40:04,463
Well, you know,
I was wondering

774
00:40:04,532 --> 00:40:07,262
while I have you on the phone,
what would you like for dinner?

775
00:40:07,335 --> 00:40:11,032
We-we have a choice between chicken
chow mein or pot roast.

776
00:40:11,106 --> 00:40:13,165
Mom. Please.

777
00:40:13,241 --> 00:40:15,300
Mom!

778
00:40:15,376 --> 00:40:17,970
- Mom!
- What is it, peanut?

779
00:40:18,046 --> 00:40:19,206
Where are my ice skates?

780
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:21,976
Oh, honey, I gave
those away years ago.

781
00:40:22,050 --> 00:40:23,984
Are you serious?
I need them.

782
00:40:24,052 --> 00:40:27,180
Well, honey, why would I keep them?
You're never here.

783
00:40:27,255 --> 00:40:29,780
Besides, you-you weren't
terribly good at ice skating.

784
00:40:29,858 --> 00:40:31,792
Well, I'm good now!

785
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:34,226
And I need my skates
to show off my talents.

786
00:40:34,295 --> 00:40:37,753
Oh, well, honey,
I'm sure you can rent a pair.

787
00:40:37,832 --> 00:40:40,392
Besides, you don't have
to show off for Jamie.

788
00:40:40,468 --> 00:40:42,959
Just...
just be yourself.

789
00:40:43,037 --> 00:40:45,835
# Be yourself #

790
00:40:45,907 --> 00:40:50,708
# Be yourself,
be yourself. #

791
00:40:50,778 --> 00:40:54,214
Now, come on! Mikey and I are
making snow angels!

792
00:40:55,850 --> 00:40:57,784
I don't want
to be myself.

793
00:41:00,188 --> 00:41:01,883
My snow globe collection.

794
00:41:08,196 --> 00:41:12,030
# Jingle bells, jingle bells,
jingle all the way #

795
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:14,034
# Oh what fun it is to ride
in a one-horse open sleigh... #

796
00:41:15,704 --> 00:41:17,198
Stupid rental skates.

797
00:41:17,422 --> 00:41:19,804
You know what?
You're a lot better than before.

798
00:41:19,874 --> 00:41:22,775
- I'm wearing figure skates from the '30s.
- Here, let me help you.

799
00:41:22,844 --> 00:41:24,709
Okay, I can do it myself, okay?
I'm good. I'm good now.

800
00:41:28,950 --> 00:41:30,713
- So...
- So...

801
00:41:30,785 --> 00:41:34,846
- How's the love life?
- Lame.

802
00:41:34,923 --> 00:41:38,654
- Marty and I broke up a year ago.
- Another jerk?

803
00:41:38,726 --> 00:41:40,751
- "Another jerk?"
- I'm kidding...

804
00:41:40,828 --> 00:41:42,762
I'm just saying you
dated a lot of jerks

805
00:41:42,830 --> 00:41:44,730
back in high school,
that's all.

806
00:41:44,799 --> 00:41:48,496
So how about you? You in love
with anyone besides yourself?

807
00:41:48,570 --> 00:41:51,698
No.

808
00:41:51,773 --> 00:41:54,571
I've really just
been dating, you know?

809
00:41:54,642 --> 00:41:56,906
Just trying to look
for my soulmate.

810
00:41:56,978 --> 00:41:58,138
You didn't buy that,
did you?

811
00:41:58,213 --> 00:42:00,374
Maybe you
should try harder.

812
00:42:00,448 --> 00:42:03,645
Or I could try this.

813
00:42:04,819 --> 00:42:06,309
Oh...

814
00:42:07,889 --> 00:42:10,687
Hey guys,
it's Miss Palamino!

815
00:42:10,758 --> 00:42:12,749
Yay!

816
00:42:12,827 --> 00:42:14,886
Hi, guys.

817
00:42:14,963 --> 00:42:17,830
Sarah and Joey
and Brett. Hi!

818
00:42:17,899 --> 00:42:20,732
- What, you... you know these kids?
- Yeah, I substitute teach

819
00:42:20,802 --> 00:42:23,498
- their class.
- Hey, um, we're having a pickup game.

820
00:42:23,571 --> 00:42:26,131
We could use some more bodies.
You guys play?

821
00:42:26,207 --> 00:42:28,801
You know Chris is a great player,
but he has rentals.

822
00:42:28,876 --> 00:42:32,277
- A good skater can skate in anything.
- Yeah!

823
00:42:32,347 --> 00:42:34,178
I'm in.

824
00:42:35,783 --> 00:42:40,015
Okay, guys. Keep it clean.

825
00:42:40,088 --> 00:42:41,248
Shoot it!

826
00:42:41,322 --> 00:42:43,950
Get it in!
And goal!

827
00:42:45,994 --> 00:42:49,088
- What was that?!
- You're pathetic!

828
00:42:49,163 --> 00:42:51,063
I'm sorry, okay?

829
00:42:51,132 --> 00:42:53,362
It's just these damn
rental skates.

830
00:42:53,434 --> 00:42:56,528
It's fine. Just don't cuss in front
of the children.

831
00:42:56,604 --> 00:42:58,333
Potty mouth.

832
00:42:59,874 --> 00:43:02,536
Get him, Terry!

833
00:43:05,013 --> 00:43:07,072
He hacked me!

834
00:43:07,148 --> 00:43:08,809
Wanna fight, punk?

835
00:43:08,883 --> 00:43:11,351
- What, are you kidding me?
- Fight!

836
00:43:11,419 --> 00:43:13,979
Fight! Fight!
Fight! Fight!

837
00:43:14,055 --> 00:43:17,218
All right, all right,
break it up, break it up.

838
00:43:17,292 --> 00:43:20,056
What is your problem?
She's just a child.

839
00:43:20,128 --> 00:43:22,528
- That's a girl?
- Pussy!

840
00:43:28,236 --> 00:43:31,535
- Yeah!
- All right!

841
00:43:35,710 --> 00:43:38,008
Okay, listen. We're getting
creamed out there.

842
00:43:38,079 --> 00:43:40,547
- It's his fault.
- You suck, Brander.

843
00:43:40,615 --> 00:43:42,913
- Hey.
- I brand you "Suckster."

844
00:43:42,984 --> 00:43:44,781
- Oh my... that's enough.
- Hey.

845
00:43:44,852 --> 00:43:47,343
Now Chris is trying
his best here.

846
00:43:47,422 --> 00:43:50,016
Sorry, Miss Palamino,
but he's just so terrible.

847
00:43:50,091 --> 00:43:53,288
- I'm not terrible.
- Suckster! Suckster! Suckster! Suckster!

848
00:43:53,361 --> 00:43:55,693
- Maybe you should call it a day.
- No, I can do this!

849
00:43:55,763 --> 00:43:58,197
- Suckster! Suckster. Suckster! Suckster...
- Hey!

850
00:43:58,266 --> 00:44:00,029
I'm a really good skater,
little girl!

851
00:44:00,101 --> 00:44:03,559
Watch! You might
learn something!

852
00:44:03,638 --> 00:44:05,333
I'm taking this one.

853
00:44:09,277 --> 00:44:11,711
Me?

854
00:44:19,153 --> 00:44:21,883
Chris, no!

855
00:44:33,668 --> 00:44:37,104
No!

856
00:44:38,773 --> 00:44:41,435
No slap shots!

857
00:44:53,154 --> 00:44:55,019
Suckster! Suckster!

858
00:44:55,089 --> 00:44:58,115
Suckster! Suckster!
Suckster!

859
00:44:58,192 --> 00:45:00,285
Suckster! Suckster!

860
00:45:00,361 --> 00:45:03,956
- What a schmuck.
- Don't worry, Chris. You're gonna be fine.

861
00:45:11,691 --> 00:45:13,464
Well, it looks like I was

862
00:45:13,541 --> 00:45:16,237
- in the right place at the right time, Miss...
- Yeah.

863
00:45:16,310 --> 00:45:19,211
Palamino?
Jamie Palamino.

864
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:22,010
- Dusty Dinkleman?
- Yeah.

865
00:45:22,083 --> 00:45:24,608
Actually, I go by
"Dusty Lee" now, but yeah.

866
00:45:24,685 --> 00:45:27,347
- "Dutty Nee?"
- Thanks for saving me.

867
00:45:27,422 --> 00:45:29,890
Yay, Dusty!

868
00:45:29,957 --> 00:45:32,118
- You remember Chris Brander?
- Eeh.

869
00:45:32,193 --> 00:45:34,525
- Boo...
- Oh, yeah.

870
00:45:34,595 --> 00:45:37,155
Seen better days, I guess, pal?

871
00:45:37,231 --> 00:45:39,529
Hey, listen, I don't
want to make this weird,

872
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:41,500
but you look incredible.

873
00:45:41,569 --> 00:45:44,436
- So do you.
- Really glad you dropped in.

874
00:45:53,514 --> 00:45:55,448
Cool...

875
00:45:57,452 --> 00:46:00,717
Sorry about that, buddy.

876
00:46:00,788 --> 00:46:02,619
Here we go.

877
00:46:04,659 --> 00:46:06,650
Late '20s.
Male Caucasian

878
00:46:06,727 --> 00:46:09,890
with multiple lacerations on lower
mandible and possible concussion.

879
00:46:09,964 --> 00:46:11,625
Transport en route,
over.

880
00:46:11,699 --> 00:46:13,758
- 10-4.
- So, Jamie,

881
00:46:13,835 --> 00:46:16,531
- you still living in town?
- Oh, yeah, I just moved back.

882
00:46:16,604 --> 00:46:18,538
Oh, really?
Me too.

883
00:46:18,606 --> 00:46:20,972
- It's a small world.
- No kidding.

884
00:46:21,042 --> 00:46:22,304
Jeez, you know,

885
00:46:22,376 --> 00:46:25,209
I cannot get over
how great you look.

886
00:46:25,279 --> 00:46:27,873
Oh, pfft. Me?
Look at you!

887
00:46:27,949 --> 00:46:30,144
Yeah, I guess
my skin cleared up

888
00:46:30,218 --> 00:46:31,879
and I lost my stammer,

889
00:46:31,953 --> 00:46:34,080
but I still play
a mean guitar.

890
00:46:34,155 --> 00:46:36,555
I'm actually only doing this part-time
till I can make it in music.

891
00:46:36,624 --> 00:46:39,821
You know, Chris is in the music business
too. He could probably help you.

892
00:46:39,894 --> 00:46:42,658
Oh, hey.
Easy there, Gretzky.

893
00:46:45,132 --> 00:46:48,693
You know, we should hang out,
you know, have lunch sometime?

894
00:46:49,737 --> 00:46:52,535
I would love
to have lunch.

895
00:46:52,607 --> 00:46:54,302
Um, where can I give you
my phone number?

896
00:46:54,375 --> 00:46:55,899
Just write it on this.

897
00:47:00,681 --> 00:47:02,842
Jamie Palamino.

898
00:47:02,917 --> 00:47:04,509
This is bullshit!

899
00:47:04,585 --> 00:47:06,246
You haven't aged a peep.

900
00:47:10,124 --> 00:47:13,855
What do you know
about Dusty Dinkleman?

901
00:47:13,928 --> 00:47:15,259
- You mean Dusty Lee?
- Yeah.

902
00:47:15,329 --> 00:47:17,297
Works in the building,
drives ambulance. Why?

903
00:47:17,365 --> 00:47:20,892
Well check this out.
So I'm out with Jamie again...

904
00:47:20,968 --> 00:47:22,629
Another day date?

905
00:47:22,703 --> 00:47:25,171
Yes. Anyway,

906
00:47:25,239 --> 00:47:26,866
we're having
a great time

907
00:47:26,941 --> 00:47:29,239
and then Dusty shows up
out of nowhere,

908
00:47:29,310 --> 00:47:31,744
and then Jamie
gives him her number.

909
00:47:31,812 --> 00:47:35,179
Hey, didn't Dusty have like
a huge crush on Jamie?

910
00:47:35,585 --> 00:47:37,649
Yeah, you got some

911
00:47:37,718 --> 00:47:40,016
competition there, Chris.
I mean, Dusty is a really nice guy.

912
00:47:40,087 --> 00:47:42,578
Yeah, well Jamie
doesn't date nice guys.

913
00:47:42,657 --> 00:47:44,249
She puts them in
the friend zone

914
00:47:44,325 --> 00:47:46,190
and then tortures
the shit out of them.

915
00:47:46,260 --> 00:47:48,694
I don't know. Jamie's come
a long way since high school.

916
00:47:48,763 --> 00:47:51,357
I think she
might be maturing.

917
00:47:51,432 --> 00:47:52,956
Maturing?

918
00:47:54,635 --> 00:47:56,603
So that's why
she went with Dusty.

919
00:47:56,671 --> 00:47:58,536
She wants
a sensitive guy...

920
00:47:58,606 --> 00:48:00,540
more like the old me.

921
00:48:00,608 --> 00:48:02,371
Well, if she wants
Mr. Rogers,

922
00:48:02,443 --> 00:48:04,377
then I'm going
to show her

923
00:48:04,445 --> 00:48:06,310
the biggest pussy
she's ever seen.

924
00:48:06,380 --> 00:48:08,245
Yeah.

925
00:48:08,316 --> 00:48:10,511
Okay, we're done.
Now...

926
00:48:10,585 --> 00:48:13,019
you're gonna need to wear this
for the next few days

927
00:48:13,087 --> 00:48:16,079
until those stitches
are ready to come out.

928
00:48:16,157 --> 00:48:18,853
And here you go.
Just like your old yearbook picture.

929
00:48:20,995 --> 00:48:24,055
# Feel my love from afar. #

930
00:48:24,131 --> 00:48:26,258
Come in!

931
00:48:26,334 --> 00:48:29,030
- Can I come in?
- I just said that.

932
00:48:31,272 --> 00:48:33,365
I brought magazines.

933
00:48:33,441 --> 00:48:35,409
Ugh, these are old.

934
00:48:35,476 --> 00:48:38,604
- Flowers?
- Those are daisies.

935
00:48:38,679 --> 00:48:41,910
- How about snacks?
- Carbs? Are you kidding me?

936
00:48:41,983 --> 00:48:43,416
I can't eat that crap.

937
00:48:43,484 --> 00:48:45,679
I'm just trying
to be helpful.

938
00:48:45,753 --> 00:48:49,416
Well you're not.
So vamoose.

939
00:48:49,490 --> 00:48:52,823
- I guess I'll just leave you now.
- No, wait wait.

940
00:48:52,893 --> 00:48:55,418
I'm sorry I'm being
such a biatch.

941
00:48:55,496 --> 00:48:57,987
It's just that I'm supposed
to be in Paris and I'm not,

942
00:48:58,065 --> 00:49:01,125
and I'm going out of my mind
with boredom!

943
00:49:01,202 --> 00:49:04,103
I mean, my Sidekick
broke and l...

944
00:49:04,171 --> 00:49:08,335
I haven't had sex
in, like, forever.

945
00:49:08,409 --> 00:49:10,001
And I'm so horny.

946
00:49:10,077 --> 00:49:13,069
I'm horny.

947
00:49:13,147 --> 00:49:15,513
Wait a minute.

948
00:49:16,751 --> 00:49:20,653
- How old are you?
- I'm 22... 20... 19...

949
00:49:20,721 --> 00:49:22,586
I'm... I'm 18.

950
00:49:22,657 --> 00:49:24,557
Eighteen.

951
00:49:27,161 --> 00:49:30,187
So do you really have
my poster on your wall?

952
00:49:30,264 --> 00:49:33,722
- Yeah.
- Do you ever like...

953
00:49:33,801 --> 00:49:35,735
All the time.

954
00:49:35,803 --> 00:49:37,532
How many times in a day?

955
00:49:37,605 --> 00:49:40,233
- Eight.
- Eight?!

956
00:49:44,645 --> 00:49:46,772
Eight? Oh my God,
that's hot.

957
00:49:46,847 --> 00:49:50,283
- You're hot.
- I know, I know.

958
00:49:53,087 --> 00:49:55,920
- Oh, ow.
- Are you okay?

959
00:49:55,990 --> 00:49:58,049
Oh, my back
is killing me.

960
00:49:58,125 --> 00:50:00,593
Oh, I could
give you a massage.

961
00:50:00,661 --> 00:50:02,959
Oh, would you mind?

962
00:50:03,030 --> 00:50:05,965
Not at all.

963
00:50:06,033 --> 00:50:09,594
- I'm naked.
- You're naked.

964
00:50:09,670 --> 00:50:11,729
Do you have any oil?

965
00:50:11,806 --> 00:50:14,331
Right back.

966
00:50:19,013 --> 00:50:20,446
What took you
so long?

967
00:50:23,617 --> 00:50:26,142
- Show me what you've got, baby.
- Okay.

968
00:50:26,220 --> 00:50:28,154
Baby, ooh!

969
00:50:28,222 --> 00:50:30,122
Ooh, more more!

970
00:50:32,660 --> 00:50:34,252
- Okay, enough. Enough!
- Okay.

971
00:50:34,580 --> 00:50:36,796
Oh, yeah.

972
00:50:41,302 --> 00:50:43,133
Merry Christmas, neighbor.

973
00:50:49,510 --> 00:50:51,444
- Ooh, yeah.
- Mikey likey,

974
00:50:51,512 --> 00:50:55,107
- Mikey likey, Mikey likey, Mikey likey...
- Yeah...

975
00:50:56,951 --> 00:50:58,942
Oh! Where the hell
have you been?!

976
00:50:59,019 --> 00:51:00,782
I was getting you food.

977
00:51:00,855 --> 00:51:03,085
- Are you wearing braces?
- It's not braces.

978
00:51:03,157 --> 00:51:05,955
It's a retainer
and it's not that bad.

979
00:51:06,026 --> 00:51:09,655
- Ha, you look like a doofus!
- Doofus!

980
00:51:10,798 --> 00:51:13,198
Doofus! Doofus!

981
00:51:13,267 --> 00:51:16,395
Doofus! Doofus!
Doof...

982
00:51:18,105 --> 00:51:19,732
Chris?

983
00:51:19,807 --> 00:51:22,435
Mommy.

984
00:51:22,510 --> 00:51:25,343
So pretty.

985
00:51:25,412 --> 00:51:28,540
Honey, look what
just came for you.

986
00:51:28,616 --> 00:51:31,380
It's a "Get well soon"
card from Jamie.

987
00:51:34,688 --> 00:51:37,213
- Boo.
- Oh yeah?

988
00:51:37,291 --> 00:51:38,781
What do you
think of that?

989
00:51:38,859 --> 00:51:41,623
It's hugs and kisses, dude.
Mom writes that on my cards.

990
00:51:41,695 --> 00:51:44,960
That's because
I love you both so much.

991
00:51:46,433 --> 00:51:48,230
Thanks, Mommy.

992
00:51:56,744 --> 00:51:58,837
Oh, God.

993
00:52:06,020 --> 00:52:08,488
Truce!

994
00:52:09,623 --> 00:52:11,614
Total pussy.

995
00:52:11,692 --> 00:52:14,627
You're the biggest pussy
on planet Earth.

996
00:52:14,695 --> 00:52:16,788
It's you.

997
00:52:19,867 --> 00:52:22,665
- Hello?
- Jamie!

998
00:52:22,736 --> 00:52:25,830
- Chris! How are you feeling?
- So much better.

999
00:52:25,906 --> 00:52:27,567
Listen, I know
it's Christmas Eve,

1000
00:52:27,641 --> 00:52:30,701
- but do you have any plans tonight?
- No.

1001
00:52:30,778 --> 00:52:32,575
Well...

1002
00:52:32,646 --> 00:52:34,580
the revival theater
in town

1003
00:52:34,648 --> 00:52:36,639
is showing Nicholas Sparks's
"The Notebook."

1004
00:52:38,853 --> 00:52:41,822
- Hello? I'm on the phone.
- Really you want to see "The Notebook"?

1005
00:52:41,889 --> 00:52:44,187
Yes, because I love
sentimental tear-jerkers.

1006
00:52:44,258 --> 00:52:46,158
I'm gonna friggin' puke.

1007
00:52:46,227 --> 00:52:48,024
Just a second.

1008
00:52:52,733 --> 00:52:55,258
- You are so dead. Do you hear me?
- Whatever, dude.

1009
00:52:55,336 --> 00:52:57,463
- What're you doing over there?
- Faggot.

1010
00:52:57,538 --> 00:52:59,267
- Nothing.
- That's my call-waiting. One second.

1011
00:52:59,340 --> 00:53:00,807
- So, anyway...
- Hello?

1012
00:53:00,875 --> 00:53:03,241
- Hey, Jamie. It's Dusty.
- Hey, Dusty.

1013
00:53:03,310 --> 00:53:04,470
Hey, listen, just...

1014
00:53:06,313 --> 00:53:07,905
Dude, I think
she left you hanging.

1015
00:53:07,982 --> 00:53:11,247
It's probably just an important
business call. Get off the phone.

1016
00:53:11,318 --> 00:53:14,481
- What, the bar ran out of curly fries?
- Get off the phone.

1017
00:53:14,555 --> 00:53:16,614
Dude, are you gonna
boink Jamie tonight?

1018
00:53:16,690 --> 00:53:18,681
Yes.
Are you happy now?

1019
00:53:18,759 --> 00:53:21,557
All right.

1020
00:53:21,629 --> 00:53:24,621
- Dude, "The Notebook"'s so gay.
- Get off the phone!

1021
00:53:24,698 --> 00:53:28,190
- Sorry about that.
- That's okay.

1022
00:53:28,269 --> 00:53:30,499
- So anyway, what do you say?
- About what?

1023
00:53:30,571 --> 00:53:32,505
Going to a movie tonight?
Then maybe later

1024
00:53:32,573 --> 00:53:35,974
we can go for some...
herbal tea.

1025
00:53:36,043 --> 00:53:38,341
Okay, sure.

1026
00:53:38,412 --> 00:53:40,744
Um... You know what?
You're on my way to the theater.

1027
00:53:40,814 --> 00:53:42,304
Why don't I pick you up
at like 7:30?

1028
00:53:42,383 --> 00:53:43,850
- It's a date.
- Homo.

1029
00:53:43,918 --> 00:53:45,647
- Bye for now.
- Bye.

1030
00:53:49,290 --> 00:53:52,555
Mom! Mom! Truce!

1031
00:53:54,428 --> 00:53:57,091
Paris, here we come!

1032
00:53:58,966 --> 00:54:02,129
- But I'm not ready to play a gig.
- Of course you are.

1033
00:54:02,202 --> 00:54:05,137
No. No.

1034
00:54:05,205 --> 00:54:06,638
No!

1035
00:54:06,707 --> 00:54:11,167
- This is a bad idea, Chris.
- God, I'm so stupid!

1036
00:54:11,245 --> 00:54:14,578
- No you're not, baby.
- Here I am, trying to nurture this artist,

1037
00:54:14,648 --> 00:54:18,641
yet you're this
pop bubblegum sensation,

1038
00:54:18,719 --> 00:54:21,711
and that's okay.

1039
00:54:21,789 --> 00:54:23,723
Paris, here we come!

1040
00:54:25,292 --> 00:54:27,988
But I am an artist.
I am an artist!

1041
00:54:28,062 --> 00:54:30,792
Hey! I am an artist!

1042
00:54:30,864 --> 00:54:33,594
- Let's go do this.
- Are you ready for this?

1043
00:54:33,667 --> 00:54:36,465
I was born ready, bitch.

1044
00:54:36,537 --> 00:54:38,698
- I'm really excited about this.
- Yeah, me too.

1045
00:54:38,772 --> 00:54:41,036
- Yeah.
- Okay, let's do this.

1046
00:54:41,108 --> 00:54:44,805
Yeah.

1047
00:54:44,878 --> 00:54:48,006
- Hey! Wait! You're not coming with me?
- Of course I am.

1048
00:54:48,082 --> 00:54:49,709
Mike's just giving you
a ride to the gig.

1049
00:54:49,783 --> 00:54:52,217
I'm gonna stay here, I'm gonna do
some administrative work

1050
00:54:52,286 --> 00:54:53,878
and I'm gonna
meet you there.

1051
00:54:53,954 --> 00:54:55,615
It's open mic night
at The Coffee House.

1052
00:54:55,689 --> 00:54:58,021
Coffee House is lame, dude.
Come on...

1053
00:54:58,092 --> 00:54:59,616
all right!

1054
00:54:59,693 --> 00:55:01,684
Think fast. Boop!

1055
00:55:08,002 --> 00:55:09,936
# And I swear #

1056
00:55:10,004 --> 00:55:11,995
- # By the moon and the stars... #
- Jesus.

1057
00:55:12,072 --> 00:55:15,405
- # In the skies... #
- Looks like the Michael Bolton starter kit.

1058
00:55:15,476 --> 00:55:18,673
# I'll be there #

1059
00:55:18,746 --> 00:55:21,579
# And I swear #

1060
00:55:21,648 --> 00:55:25,140
# Like a shadow
that's by your side. #

1061
00:55:25,219 --> 00:55:27,244
Showtime.

1062
00:55:38,198 --> 00:55:40,564
Come on!
How long does it...

1063
00:55:42,870 --> 00:55:44,838
- Mistletoe.
- Hello.

1064
00:55:44,905 --> 00:55:47,499
- Oh my God!
- Jamie! How are you?

1065
00:55:47,574 --> 00:55:50,839
You've grown into such
a beautiful young woman,

1066
00:55:50,911 --> 00:55:53,209
hasn't she, Chris?

1067
00:55:56,183 --> 00:55:57,878
Ding-dong.

1068
00:55:59,486 --> 00:56:01,852
Dusty. Hey. Why?

1069
00:56:01,922 --> 00:56:04,413
Are you kidding, man?
I love "The Notebook".

1070
00:56:04,491 --> 00:56:06,152
I mean, listen,
I know it might sound

1071
00:56:06,226 --> 00:56:08,160
a little corny,
maybe even a little femme,

1072
00:56:08,228 --> 00:56:09,889
but I find something
so resplendent

1073
00:56:09,963 --> 00:56:12,727
in the simplicity of Nicholas Sparks'
writing, you know what I mean?

1074
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:16,236
Nice outfit, by the way.
Rock and roll.

1075
00:56:16,303 --> 00:56:18,134
Carol?

1076
00:56:18,205 --> 00:56:20,765
Oh my God.

1077
00:56:20,841 --> 00:56:23,002
- Carol...
- Dusty, oh my goodness.

1078
00:56:23,077 --> 00:56:25,807
- This is old-home week.
- Oh, absolutely.

1079
00:56:25,879 --> 00:56:29,906
- Is it okay that Dusty came?
- Oh, it's awesome that Dusty came.

1080
00:56:29,983 --> 00:56:31,974
Thank you.
- Okay.

1081
00:56:32,052 --> 00:56:33,781
...in the hospital. We got...
- Dust!

1082
00:56:33,854 --> 00:56:36,322
Hey, let's hit the road.

1083
00:56:36,390 --> 00:56:37,982
Well, you kids
have fun.

1084
00:56:38,058 --> 00:56:39,753
Oh, Carol, why don't
you come join us?

1085
00:56:39,827 --> 00:56:42,853
She's vacuuming.

1086
00:56:42,930 --> 00:56:46,263
W-well, I'd love to, but l...
I wouldn't want to impose.

1087
00:56:46,333 --> 00:56:50,429
- Oh, no imposition at all!
- No.

1088
00:56:50,504 --> 00:56:52,597
We'd love to have you,
wouldn't we, Chris?

1089
00:56:52,673 --> 00:56:55,767
Yeah, rad.
Awesome.

1090
00:56:55,843 --> 00:56:57,606
Mom's coming.
That's good.

1091
00:56:57,678 --> 00:57:00,044
- There's a group now.
- Yes!

1092
00:57:00,114 --> 00:57:02,708
- It was us. It was us.
- Oh, my darling.

1093
00:57:02,783 --> 00:57:05,377
Oh my sweetheart.

1094
00:57:05,452 --> 00:57:07,943
I love you so much.

1095
00:57:14,495 --> 00:57:18,625
- How much time do we have?
- I'm not sure.

1096
00:57:18,699 --> 00:57:21,167
Last time it was no more
than five minutes.

1097
00:57:23,036 --> 00:57:25,402
I love you, angel.

1098
00:57:27,774 --> 00:57:29,435
What happened to me?

1099
00:57:29,510 --> 00:57:31,535
This is so gay.

1100
00:57:39,186 --> 00:57:42,917
Oh, Dusty...

1101
00:57:47,930 --> 00:57:49,661
Son of a bitch!

1102
00:57:50,464 --> 00:57:53,558
Peanut.

1103
00:57:57,304 --> 00:58:00,330
No.

1104
00:58:02,409 --> 00:58:06,311
# Forgiveness... #

1105
00:58:06,380 --> 00:58:08,314
Show us your tits!

1106
00:58:08,382 --> 00:58:11,510
- # Is more than saying sorry. #
- Hey! Ashlee Simpson!

1107
00:58:11,585 --> 00:58:12,882
Forgive this!

1108
00:58:13,954 --> 00:58:15,888
Dusty, what kind
of car is this?

1109
00:58:15,956 --> 00:58:19,289
Carol, this little Japanese princess
here is called the Prius.

1110
00:58:19,359 --> 00:58:21,088
I think it's so neat
that you kids

1111
00:58:21,161 --> 00:58:23,095
care about
the environment.

1112
00:58:23,163 --> 00:58:26,758
- I love the environment.
- But honey, don't you drive

1113
00:58:26,833 --> 00:58:29,734
a Range Rover?
Aren't those bad?

1114
00:58:29,803 --> 00:58:31,896
Well, I had a really
nice time tonight,

1115
00:58:31,972 --> 00:58:33,530
and I hope we can
do it again soon.

1116
00:58:33,607 --> 00:58:35,734
Hey, Dusty,
thanks for comin'.

1117
00:58:35,809 --> 00:58:37,936
Oh, listen, man, it was
my pleasure, really.

1118
00:58:38,011 --> 00:58:40,946
Thank you all for having me.
It was so nice.

1119
00:58:41,014 --> 00:58:43,073
And hey, before I forget,
make sure

1120
00:58:43,150 --> 00:58:45,482
that you rinse that thing
at least twice a day, okay?

1121
00:58:45,552 --> 00:58:48,680
Your mouth is
a disgusting open cesspool

1122
00:58:48,755 --> 00:58:50,985
with germs and bacteria.
Now put that back!

1123
00:58:51,058 --> 00:58:53,219
- Christopher, put that back.
- Put it back!

1124
00:58:54,928 --> 00:58:56,395
Thanks.

1125
00:58:56,463 --> 00:58:58,488
Hey, anyone want
some cocoa?

1126
00:58:58,565 --> 00:59:01,398
Oh, Carol,
you are so sweet!

1127
00:59:01,468 --> 00:59:04,403
And I would love to do that,
except I volunteered at the hospital

1128
00:59:04,471 --> 00:59:06,496
so that Paul could spend
Christmas Eve with his family.

1129
00:59:06,573 --> 00:59:09,269
- So, I kinda gotta get going.
- Aw.

1130
00:59:09,343 --> 00:59:11,140
That's a drag. God!

1131
00:59:11,211 --> 00:59:13,042
Hey, Jamie,
what about you?

1132
00:59:14,982 --> 00:59:17,416
- Ready?
- Give me a Cougar roar. Cougar roar!

1133
00:59:19,086 --> 00:59:20,383
Aw.

1134
00:59:20,454 --> 00:59:24,185
Cookie Monster says
the Cougars are

1135
00:59:24,258 --> 00:59:27,421
great big cookies

1136
00:59:27,494 --> 00:59:29,587
at the top of the jar.

1137
00:59:29,663 --> 00:59:32,530
Ladies and Gentleman,
the amazing Chris Brander.

1138
00:59:32,599 --> 00:59:34,658
Oh my gosh,
I remember this.

1139
00:59:34,735 --> 00:59:39,104
He juggles three tennis balls,
but gets bored very quickly

1140
00:59:39,172 --> 00:59:41,538
and wants something else.

1141
00:59:42,364 --> 00:59:43,465
Clear!

1142
00:59:44,966 --> 00:59:46,041
Clear!

1143
00:59:47,914 --> 00:59:50,075
No kissing!

1144
00:59:50,150 --> 00:59:52,482
That's right, Jamie Palamino,

1145
00:59:52,552 --> 00:59:54,577
you're my best friend!

1146
00:59:54,655 --> 00:59:56,589
I love you, Chris Brander.
Mwha!

1147
00:59:56,657 --> 00:59:59,421
Mwha, mwha, mwha!

1148
00:59:59,493 --> 01:00:03,259
Oh, your mom's car.
You see, this is more like you.

1149
01:00:03,330 --> 01:00:06,424
Yeah, I'm gonna take it
back to L.A.

1150
01:00:09,936 --> 01:00:12,496
- What?
- Guess what I found?

1151
01:00:12,572 --> 01:00:16,167
- No, the tape I made you?
- 1995.

1152
01:00:16,243 --> 01:00:18,768
- "The Summer of Like."
- Put it in.

1153
01:00:20,080 --> 01:00:23,709
# Dun-nun-de-dun
de-dun-dun-dun #

1154
01:00:34,294 --> 01:00:36,558
Oh, God.

1155
01:00:36,630 --> 01:00:38,621
- Oh!
- Oh my God,

1156
01:00:38,699 --> 01:00:40,724
I just peed a little.

1157
01:00:40,801 --> 01:00:44,328
- Good night, guys.
- Good night, Chris.

1158
01:00:48,108 --> 01:00:50,338
What's up?

1159
01:00:50,410 --> 01:00:52,241
- Little problem.
- Where are you?

1160
01:00:52,312 --> 01:00:54,109
- The Metal Shop.
- What?!

1161
01:00:57,184 --> 01:00:59,243
- That's it, bitch. It's on!
- Come on!

1162
01:00:59,655 --> 01:01:02,880
I'm gonna kill you!
Not so funny now, bitch?!

1163
01:01:02,956 --> 01:01:04,924
- Not so funny now?!
- I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

1164
01:01:04,991 --> 01:01:07,892
# Christmas, Christmas,
the happiest day of the year... #

1165
01:01:07,961 --> 01:01:09,986
Kudos on the
Christmas cookies, Mom.

1166
01:01:10,063 --> 01:01:12,361
Thanks, pumpkin.
I'll be back in an hour.

1167
01:01:12,432 --> 01:01:16,095
# Where sleigh bells ringing
and go jingle-ling #

1168
01:01:16,169 --> 01:01:18,501
# As we're dashing
through the snow #

1169
01:01:20,841 --> 01:01:24,402
# Christmas, Christmas #

1170
01:01:24,478 --> 01:01:27,140
# So, Jesus,
hear our song... #

1171
01:01:27,214 --> 01:01:29,478
- What's up, Dude?
- Quiet, she's sleeping.

1172
01:01:29,549 --> 01:01:31,210
I'm going over
to Jamie's.

1173
01:01:31,284 --> 01:01:33,081
- Did you boink her yet?
- Shut it.

1174
01:01:33,153 --> 01:01:35,144
If she wakes up,
tell her I went to meet Bono.

1175
01:01:35,222 --> 01:01:37,782
- You're gonna meet Bono? I wanna come.
- No, you walking void,

1176
01:01:37,858 --> 01:01:40,656
it's a lie, but if she wakes up
just tell her I'll be back in a bit.

1177
01:01:40,727 --> 01:01:42,695
- Fine!
- Fine!

1178
01:01:44,097 --> 01:01:45,724
- I love you.
- I love you too.

1179
01:01:54,374 --> 01:01:57,502
# Christmas,
Christmas #

1180
01:01:57,577 --> 01:01:59,909
- # The happiest day of the year #
- Mike!

1181
01:02:02,549 --> 01:02:05,347
Oh, God!

1182
01:02:05,419 --> 01:02:10,413
# Spreading
Christmas cheer #

1183
01:02:10,490 --> 01:02:12,424
# We wish you
a Merry Christmas #

1184
01:02:12,492 --> 01:02:14,824
# We wish you a Merry Christmas
and a Happy New Year #

1185
01:02:14,895 --> 01:02:16,988
This is pathetic!

1186
01:02:17,063 --> 01:02:21,432
# Good tidings we bring,
to you and your kin #

1187
01:02:21,501 --> 01:02:23,526
# Good tidings for Christmas #

1188
01:02:23,603 --> 01:02:25,366
- # And a Happy New Year #
- Oh shit!

1189
01:02:48,595 --> 01:02:50,529
Thank you, guys.
Thank you.

1190
01:02:50,597 --> 01:02:52,531
Encore! Encore!
Encore!

1191
01:02:52,599 --> 01:02:54,533
Okay, all right,
one more time.

1192
01:02:54,601 --> 01:02:57,035
- One more time. Okay.
- Oh yeah!

1193
01:02:57,103 --> 01:03:00,869
Here we go.
You guys, you know,

1194
01:03:00,941 --> 01:03:02,568
Christmas is the time
for giving.

1195
01:03:02,642 --> 01:03:04,940
And the most precious gift
that you can give...

1196
01:03:05,011 --> 01:03:08,208
- is your heart.
- Aww.

1197
01:03:08,281 --> 01:03:10,749
Jamie Palamino,
this is my gift to you.

1198
01:03:10,817 --> 01:03:14,651
# When Jamie smiles #

1199
01:03:14,721 --> 01:03:19,317
# It takes me miles #

1200
01:03:19,392 --> 01:03:23,419
# From where I feel unsure #

1201
01:03:25,465 --> 01:03:28,559
# When Jamie smiles #

1202
01:03:28,635 --> 01:03:31,763
# I realize #

1203
01:03:31,838 --> 01:03:35,934
# She's no ordinary girl #

1204
01:03:39,679 --> 01:03:42,807
# No ordinary girl #

1205
01:03:55,595 --> 01:03:58,291
- Where's Chris?!
- I'll never tell you anything!

1206
01:03:58,365 --> 01:04:01,459
Oh yeah?

1207
01:04:03,737 --> 01:04:07,229
- He's with his lover.
- # Deck the halls with bows of holly #

1208
01:04:09,809 --> 01:04:13,245
# 'Tis the season
to be jolly #

1209
01:04:17,250 --> 01:04:19,684
Dude, Jamie's outside.
What are you doing up here?

1210
01:04:19,753 --> 01:04:21,744
I'm getting my butt
kicked by Dinkleman,

1211
01:04:21,821 --> 01:04:23,311
that's what
I'm doing up here.

1212
01:04:23,390 --> 01:04:26,882
You see him play that guitar?
It's like he has 15 fingers.

1213
01:04:26,960 --> 01:04:30,361
Everybody loves him.
I can't compete with this guy.

1214
01:04:30,430 --> 01:04:33,866
You can't compete with this...
are you kidding me?

1215
01:04:33,934 --> 01:04:37,097
You're Chris Brander!
You're Hollywood. You date models!

1216
01:04:37,170 --> 01:04:39,798
He's Jersey.
He skis in his jeans!

1217
01:04:39,873 --> 01:04:41,500
It's Dinkleman.

1218
01:04:41,575 --> 01:04:43,941
It's Dusty Dinkleman.

1219
01:04:45,312 --> 01:04:47,974
- Dinkleman.
- Dinkleman.

1220
01:04:48,048 --> 01:04:50,846
- Dinkleman.
- Dinkleman!

1221
01:04:50,917 --> 01:04:53,909
- Dinkleman.
- Dinkleman's going down.

1222
01:04:53,987 --> 01:04:56,581
Dinkleman...
is going way down.

1223
01:04:56,656 --> 01:04:58,419
Atta boy.

1224
01:04:58,491 --> 01:05:00,857
Now you get out there
and you tell Jamie how you feel!

1225
01:05:00,927 --> 01:05:03,794
- Let's do this.
- Atta boy.

1226
01:05:03,863 --> 01:05:07,458
Good ol' Chris Brander,
ladies and gentlemen!

1227
01:05:07,534 --> 01:05:10,697
#... Iooked down
on the Feast of Stephen #

1228
01:05:10,770 --> 01:05:13,762
# When the snow
lay round about #

1229
01:05:13,840 --> 01:05:16,308
# Deep and crisp
and even #

1230
01:05:16,376 --> 01:05:19,038
# Brightly shone
the moon that night #

1231
01:05:19,112 --> 01:05:21,171
# Though the frost
was cruel #

1232
01:05:23,450 --> 01:05:25,441
What the...

1233
01:05:28,755 --> 01:05:32,953
# It's the most wonderful
time of the year... #

1234
01:05:33,026 --> 01:05:35,153
The jig is up!
Run!

1235
01:05:35,228 --> 01:05:37,196
You son of a bitch!

1236
01:05:37,263 --> 01:05:40,790
Samantha!
You're here! Shit!

1237
01:05:40,867 --> 01:05:42,960
There she is.
There's the little slut

1238
01:05:43,036 --> 01:05:44,799
you've been
banging behind my back!

1239
01:05:44,871 --> 01:05:47,135
- Me?
- Not you, wrinkles. Her!

1240
01:05:47,207 --> 01:05:49,698
- Who are you?
- Oh...

1241
01:05:49,776 --> 01:05:52,540
- I'm Samantha James, bitch!
- Don't shove me!

1242
01:05:52,612 --> 01:05:55,410
- You're a whore! Santa's little whore!
- Get off!

1243
01:05:55,482 --> 01:05:57,450
- Santa's little whore!
- Cat fight!

1244
01:05:59,119 --> 01:06:01,144
- Get out!
- You're gonna pay for this.

1245
01:06:01,221 --> 01:06:02,779
I'm gonna get you fired!

1246
01:06:02,856 --> 01:06:05,324
Hope you enjoy
unemployment, dickweed!

1247
01:06:05,392 --> 01:06:07,155
Get off me, God boy!

1248
01:06:07,227 --> 01:06:10,424
But Samantha, What about the words
to your song? "Forgiveness"!

1249
01:06:10,497 --> 01:06:13,125
Forgive this, asshole.

1250
01:06:13,199 --> 01:06:15,793
Oh...

1251
01:06:15,869 --> 01:06:18,531
I hate this town!

1252
01:06:18,605 --> 01:06:21,165
Call me.

1253
01:06:30,550 --> 01:06:32,074
- Chris?
- Yeah.

1254
01:06:32,152 --> 01:06:35,644
- Little problem.
- Hm?

1255
01:06:36,723 --> 01:06:38,452
Duck!

1256
01:06:41,861 --> 01:06:45,558
- Ho-ho-ho! Ho-ho!
- No! Not Santa!

1257
01:07:00,714 --> 01:07:02,841
Whoa!
Flaming reindeer.

1258
01:07:07,887 --> 01:07:11,379
You don't see
that every day.

1259
01:07:13,893 --> 01:07:16,418
Hey Chris, it's Samantha.
I just talked to my sponsor

1260
01:07:16,496 --> 01:07:18,396
and I owe you
an apology.

1261
01:07:18,465 --> 01:07:20,126
It's Samantha...
Call me...

1262
01:07:20,200 --> 01:07:21,963
It's Samantha!

1263
01:07:22,035 --> 01:07:24,868
Hello, Joyce?

1264
01:07:24,938 --> 01:07:27,634
Joyce?

1265
01:07:33,947 --> 01:07:35,881
Go away.

1266
01:07:35,949 --> 01:07:38,110
Go away!

1267
01:07:39,853 --> 01:07:42,117
Mom, I said
I have a tummy ache.

1268
01:07:44,424 --> 01:07:46,415
Well that was
an interesting Christmas.

1269
01:07:46,493 --> 01:07:49,155
I'm sorry. I'll pay
for everything.

1270
01:07:49,229 --> 01:07:50,958
I'm not here
to collect.

1271
01:07:51,030 --> 01:07:52,622
What are you doing here?

1272
01:07:52,699 --> 01:07:55,600
I want to talk to the guy
who wrote me this.

1273
01:08:01,961 --> 01:08:05,208
- Want some more?
- No. Gallon's my limit.

1274
01:08:05,278 --> 01:08:07,542
Oh, excuse me if I'm not
one of your stick models.

1275
01:08:07,614 --> 01:08:10,447
"I'm Chris Brander. I hang out
with Good Charlotte and Pink.

1276
01:08:10,517 --> 01:08:13,042
- I go to Jay Z's birthday party..."
- Okay, okay. All right.

1277
01:08:13,119 --> 01:08:15,747
- Thank you very much. I get it. I was lame.
- Yeah.

1278
01:08:15,822 --> 01:08:19,622
Actually, I was nervous,
but, more importantly,

1279
01:08:19,692 --> 01:08:21,660
does this hat
make me look fat?

1280
01:08:26,332 --> 01:08:28,892
So...

1281
01:08:28,968 --> 01:08:31,869
is your life everything
you'd hoped it'd be?

1282
01:08:31,938 --> 01:08:34,964
I always thought that
if I had a huge career

1283
01:08:35,041 --> 01:08:37,305
and famous clients
and tons of money

1284
01:08:37,377 --> 01:08:39,402
that I'd be happy.

1285
01:08:39,479 --> 01:08:41,504
And the truth is...

1286
01:08:41,581 --> 01:08:43,515
I was right.

1287
01:08:43,583 --> 01:08:46,017
I love it.
Especially the money.

1288
01:08:46,085 --> 01:08:49,248
You're so bad!

1289
01:08:49,322 --> 01:08:51,085
What about you?

1290
01:08:51,157 --> 01:08:52,749
Let's put you in
the hot seat?

1291
01:08:52,826 --> 01:08:54,623
Where do you see
yourself in 10 years?

1292
01:08:55,795 --> 01:08:59,253
Um, well, I see
myself teaching.

1293
01:08:59,332 --> 01:09:02,699
And I see myself
getting married

1294
01:09:02,769 --> 01:09:04,361
and raising a family.

1295
01:09:06,973 --> 01:09:08,406
What?

1296
01:09:11,611 --> 01:09:13,943
It's gettin' late.

1297
01:09:14,013 --> 01:09:16,413
Why don't I
take you home?

1298
01:09:16,482 --> 01:09:18,416
Or...

1299
01:09:18,484 --> 01:09:20,418
I could sleep over
like old times.

1300
01:09:38,404 --> 01:09:40,099
God.

1301
01:09:45,211 --> 01:09:46,462
Hi.

1302
01:09:56,890 --> 01:09:58,517
- Here we are.
- Yeah.

1303
01:09:58,591 --> 01:10:01,287
Yeah.

1304
01:10:12,138 --> 01:10:13,730
This is it.

1305
01:10:13,806 --> 01:10:16,798
You're finally gonna have sex
with Jamie Palamino.

1306
01:10:16,876 --> 01:10:21,142
Oh God, look at that face.
Look at that body.

1307
01:10:21,214 --> 01:10:24,479
Why are you smiling
like a friggin' idiot?

1308
01:10:24,550 --> 01:10:26,882
Go on, make a move.

1309
01:10:26,953 --> 01:10:29,114
Make a move!

1310
01:10:31,157 --> 01:10:33,091
What's on your mind?

1311
01:10:33,159 --> 01:10:35,024
Bush.

1312
01:10:36,195 --> 01:10:39,221
President Bush,
The First Family, really.

1313
01:10:46,940 --> 01:10:49,807
Dude, you're killing me!

1314
01:10:49,876 --> 01:10:53,073
This is the girl of your
dreams. Ravish her!

1315
01:10:53,146 --> 01:10:55,273
But what if she doesn't
want to be ravished?

1316
01:10:55,348 --> 01:10:57,816
What if she wants to stay friends? Friends
don't ravish each other?

1317
01:10:57,884 --> 01:11:00,182
Friends watch
"New Year's Rockin' Eve."

1318
01:11:00,253 --> 01:11:01,948
I wonder who's
hosting this year?

1319
01:11:02,021 --> 01:11:05,252
Chris, can you put your feet on mine?
They're freezing.

1320
01:11:05,325 --> 01:11:06,986
Yeah.

1321
01:11:07,060 --> 01:11:09,153
Hell yeah.
Her feet aren't even cold.

1322
01:11:09,228 --> 01:11:11,093
This is it.

1323
01:11:11,164 --> 01:11:14,463
Don't even think about
how weird tomorrow's gonna be.

1324
01:11:17,670 --> 01:11:21,697
- Chris.
- Oh, God. Oh, God.

1325
01:11:21,774 --> 01:11:24,299
What're you doing?
Where're you going?

1326
01:11:24,377 --> 01:11:26,743
- Is everything all right?
- Oh, everything's fine.

1327
01:11:26,813 --> 01:11:29,509
Yeah. You okay? You need
another blanket or anything?

1328
01:11:29,582 --> 01:11:31,243
No, I'm fine.

1329
01:11:31,317 --> 01:11:34,445
You're not gonna make
a move, are you?

1330
01:11:34,520 --> 01:11:37,148
- Good night, Jamie.
- Good night, Chris.

1331
01:11:37,223 --> 01:11:40,021
You don't deserve a penis.

1332
01:11:42,295 --> 01:11:44,058
God, and we had
this great night

1333
01:11:44,130 --> 01:11:46,155
and we were laughing

1334
01:11:46,232 --> 01:11:48,666
and we were showing each other
old pictures and...

1335
01:11:48,735 --> 01:11:50,635
- Did he try anything?
- No!

1336
01:11:50,703 --> 01:11:54,070
- Did you try anything?
- No, but I put myself out there.

1337
01:11:54,140 --> 01:11:56,472
I mean, I wore
the sexy white shirt

1338
01:11:56,542 --> 01:12:00,034
and I did the whole cold-feet move
and we slept in the same bed.

1339
01:12:00,113 --> 01:12:02,843
What the hell is wrong with you?
I mean, why didn't you sleep with her?

1340
01:12:02,915 --> 01:12:04,780
- Oh, I know. I had her.
- I mean, are you two

1341
01:12:04,851 --> 01:12:06,842
on the same menstrual
cycle yet or what?

1342
01:12:06,919 --> 01:12:10,616
I don't know,
I don't know, I don't know.

1343
01:12:10,690 --> 01:12:13,022
Maybe I just don't compare
to these L.A. Girls.

1344
01:12:13,092 --> 01:12:15,356
Look, the timing just
wasn't right, you know?

1345
01:12:15,428 --> 01:12:19,831
I'm... I'm laying there.
I'm about to make my move

1346
01:12:19,899 --> 01:12:22,265
and then suddenly
it just hits me.

1347
01:12:22,335 --> 01:12:24,269
Where's this going?

1348
01:12:24,337 --> 01:12:26,362
What happens after
we sleep together?

1349
01:12:26,439 --> 01:12:28,430
Does she move to L.A.?
Do I move back here?

1350
01:12:28,508 --> 01:12:31,477
Jesus, Dude. I thought you just
wanted to sleep with her.

1351
01:12:31,544 --> 01:12:34,104
Maybe he just wants
to be friends.

1352
01:12:34,180 --> 01:12:36,876
Maybe he's gay.

1353
01:12:36,949 --> 01:12:39,474
I can't just sleep with Jamie Palamino.
We have a history.

1354
01:12:39,552 --> 01:12:41,679
- We're... we're... we're... we're...
- Friends.

1355
01:12:43,723 --> 01:12:45,657
God damn it!

1356
01:12:45,725 --> 01:12:47,886
I'm right back in high school again,
you know?

1357
01:12:47,960 --> 01:12:51,657
I gotta follow my own advice.
I gotta just walk away.

1358
01:12:51,731 --> 01:12:53,164
No, put me on the 3:00.

1359
01:12:53,232 --> 01:12:55,166
The sooner I get out
of here, the better.

1360
01:12:55,234 --> 01:12:58,101
- You sure about this?
- No.

1361
01:12:58,171 --> 01:13:00,696
# When Janice
smiles... #

1362
01:13:00,773 --> 01:13:03,708
- Janice?
- # I realize #

1363
01:13:03,776 --> 01:13:06,836
# She's no ordinary #

1364
01:13:06,913 --> 01:13:09,939
# Girl. #

1365
01:13:17,090 --> 01:13:19,354
Hey listen.
I gotta hang out

1366
01:13:19,425 --> 01:13:21,188
with my friends
over there, okay?

1367
01:13:21,260 --> 01:13:24,161
- I'll talk to you tonight.
- Whoo!

1368
01:13:25,932 --> 01:13:29,197
- What's up, homies?
- You tell me.

1369
01:13:29,268 --> 01:13:31,099
- What's with the nurse?
- Oh, Janice.

1370
01:13:31,170 --> 01:13:33,604
Another bee
in the hive, my friend,

1371
01:13:33,673 --> 01:13:36,699
- just another bee.
- Well, what about Jamie?

1372
01:13:36,776 --> 01:13:38,539
What about her? I mean, hey,

1373
01:13:38,611 --> 01:13:41,102
it's great, right? Two biggest
geeks back in the day

1374
01:13:41,180 --> 01:13:43,375
now finally have a shot with the hottest
chick in high school?

1375
01:13:43,449 --> 01:13:46,213
- You can't write that stuff, my friend.
- Hey, are you kidding me?

1376
01:13:46,285 --> 01:13:48,879
Oh, come on, man.
Cut the nice guy routine.

1377
01:13:48,955 --> 01:13:51,116
I know what you're up to
and I am all for it.

1378
01:13:51,190 --> 01:13:53,624
I mean it is gonna be
sweet revenge on Jamie Palamino

1379
01:13:53,693 --> 01:13:55,661
for keeping us in the friend zone
all those years.

1380
01:13:55,728 --> 01:13:58,322
Oh, yeah, you wish you were
in the friend zone.

1381
01:13:58,397 --> 01:14:00,695
I was in the friend zone.
Friend zone's mine.

1382
01:14:00,766 --> 01:14:03,633
- Dusty, popcorn's ready.
- Copy that, I'm mobile.

1383
01:14:03,703 --> 01:14:05,466
- Listen, I gotta run.
- The man's juice!

1384
01:14:05,538 --> 01:14:07,472
You guys have a nice time.
It's been nice seeing you.

1385
01:14:07,540 --> 01:14:10,703
Have fun with Jamie. I know I will.
Clark, always a pleasure.

1386
01:14:10,776 --> 01:14:12,767
- Dinkleman.
- Son of a bitch.

1387
01:14:14,747 --> 01:14:16,942
So we're looking at
day cares.

1388
01:14:17,016 --> 01:14:19,541
And Darla's got this one picked
out for TJ and it's great.

1389
01:14:19,619 --> 01:14:22,179
And you know, don't get me wrong,
I want the best for my kid.

1390
01:14:22,255 --> 01:14:24,086
I mean he deserves
the best

1391
01:14:24,157 --> 01:14:27,786
but Tiny Tots is just too...
oh, Mariah Carey!

1392
01:14:31,564 --> 01:14:33,498
What the hell
are you doing?!

1393
01:14:33,566 --> 01:14:36,126
This is a
Pontiac Grand Prix!

1394
01:14:36,202 --> 01:14:38,136
I'm sorry, okay?!

1395
01:14:38,204 --> 01:14:40,900
But I can't let Dinkleman
get away with this!

1396
01:14:40,973 --> 01:14:44,704
I refuse to sit back and let Jamie
get used by another asshole!

1397
01:14:44,777 --> 01:14:48,235
You could've asked!
L.A. Guys are so dramatic.

1398
01:14:48,314 --> 01:14:50,782
- I'm sorry!
- Okay.

1399
01:14:53,085 --> 01:14:56,953
- # Christmas, Christmas... #
- Oh my God.

1400
01:14:57,023 --> 01:15:00,151
You know, one good snowfall
and you won't see any of this.

1401
01:15:00,226 --> 01:15:04,219
# Where sleigh bells ringing
and go jingle-ling #

1402
01:15:04,297 --> 01:15:07,630
# Spreading
Christmas cheer. #

1403
01:15:07,700 --> 01:15:09,793
Hi, Mr. Palamino.
How are you?

1404
01:15:09,869 --> 01:15:12,167
Come to destroy
the rest of the house?

1405
01:15:12,238 --> 01:15:14,934
Look, I'm really sorry
about yesterday.

1406
01:15:15,007 --> 01:15:18,568
- Ho-ho-ho.
- And that.

1407
01:15:18,644 --> 01:15:21,636
Look, I know you hate me, but I need
to speak with Jamie. Where is she?

1408
01:15:21,714 --> 01:15:24,615
- She's gone off with Mr. Lee.
- Dry cleaner?

1409
01:15:24,684 --> 01:15:27,983
- No. Dusty, you jackass.
- Where are they?

1410
01:15:36,462 --> 01:15:41,297
- # I've been workin' on the railroad... #
- No, Chris! This way.

1411
01:15:41,367 --> 01:15:44,700
# All the livelong day #

1412
01:15:44,770 --> 01:15:47,898
# I've been workin'
on the railroad #

1413
01:15:47,974 --> 01:15:51,705
# Just to pass
the time away #

1414
01:15:51,777 --> 01:15:55,508
# Can't you hear
the whistle blowing?

1415
01:15:55,581 --> 01:15:58,573
# Rise so early
in the morn' #

1416
01:15:58,651 --> 01:16:02,109
- Dinkleman!
- # Can't you hear the captain shouting? #

1417
01:16:02,188 --> 01:16:04,816
- Chris, what're you doing here?
- I need to talk to you.

1418
01:16:08,394 --> 01:16:09,486
Dusty!

1419
01:16:10,796 --> 01:16:11,888
Yes!

1420
01:16:14,300 --> 01:16:16,097
- I really need to speak with you!
- This next number

1421
01:16:16,168 --> 01:16:18,796
- is for your favorite teacher and mine.
- Let's go.

1422
01:16:18,871 --> 01:16:20,998
She put this wonderful concert
together for all of us.

1423
01:16:21,073 --> 01:16:24,201
Give a big round of applause
to Miss Jamie Palamino.

1424
01:16:26,279 --> 01:16:29,373
# When Jamie smiles #

1425
01:16:29,448 --> 01:16:31,609
# It takes me miles #

1426
01:16:33,919 --> 01:16:35,181
# From where I've... #

1427
01:16:35,254 --> 01:16:37,654
God, I still can't believe
he wrote me that song.

1428
01:16:37,723 --> 01:16:40,783
Oh I can. He's been working on that song
since high school, remember?

1429
01:16:40,860 --> 01:16:42,623
It's like the stalker's
national anthem.

1430
01:16:42,695 --> 01:16:44,925
Not to mention I already heard
that song today,

1431
01:16:44,997 --> 01:16:47,022
only it was Janice's eyes
that made him smile.

1432
01:16:47,099 --> 01:16:49,897
- Janice? Who's Janice?
- A nurse with really big boobs

1433
01:16:49,969 --> 01:16:53,370
that works at the medical center. A girl
I saw him kissing earlier tonight.

1434
01:16:53,439 --> 01:16:56,067
Dusty's a Jersey player,
Jamie!

1435
01:16:56,142 --> 01:16:57,541
He's out
for revenge on you

1436
01:16:57,610 --> 01:16:59,578
for putting him in the friend zone
in high school.

1437
01:16:59,645 --> 01:17:01,374
What are you
talking about?

1438
01:17:01,447 --> 01:17:03,415
The guy's looking
for the anger bang!

1439
01:17:03,482 --> 01:17:06,417
Amazing! That's exactly
what he said about you.

1440
01:17:06,485 --> 01:17:08,680
- Don't you see what's happening here?
- Oh, I don't know.

1441
01:17:08,754 --> 01:17:10,949
The guy's just
out-playing me, that's all.

1442
01:17:11,023 --> 01:17:13,184
Oh, it's about you!
Now he's out-playing you!

1443
01:17:13,259 --> 01:17:15,193
- W-what am I, a game?
- No!

1444
01:17:15,261 --> 01:17:17,024
Would you guys like
to join us in a carol

1445
01:17:17,096 --> 01:17:19,792
- to celebrate the birth of our Lord?
- No!

1446
01:17:24,103 --> 01:17:27,903
My God, don't!
Dusty! Don't!

1447
01:17:27,973 --> 01:17:30,339
- Dinkleman!
- What is the matter with you?

1448
01:17:30,409 --> 01:17:32,400
This is a Christmas
concert for children!

1449
01:17:32,478 --> 01:17:35,038
- You liar!
- Suckster's not your boyfriend, is he?

1450
01:17:35,114 --> 01:17:38,515
- No, he's not!
- 'Cause we like Dusty.

1451
01:17:38,584 --> 01:17:40,745
Dusty! Dusty!
Dusty! Dusty!

1452
01:17:40,820 --> 01:17:42,549
Dusty! Dusty! Dusty...!

1453
01:17:44,457 --> 01:17:46,948
I'm being framed!
I'm being framed!

1454
01:17:48,227 --> 01:17:51,253
- Dusty!
- Dinkleman!

1455
01:17:51,330 --> 01:17:54,299
Man, when you come back to town,
you come back to town!

1456
01:17:55,824 --> 01:17:58,098
Look, don't sweat it.

1457
01:17:58,170 --> 01:18:00,195
W-w-we'll go
to The Maple tonight

1458
01:18:00,272 --> 01:18:01,899
You can apologize
to Jamie

1459
01:18:01,974 --> 01:18:05,432
and everything will be just...
just peachy.

1460
01:18:05,511 --> 01:18:07,809
Okay, yep, good.
Thanks, Clark, for everything.

1461
01:18:07,880 --> 01:18:10,280
See you in another 10 years.
Guess not.

1462
01:18:12,485 --> 01:18:14,885
How'd it go with Jamie last night?
You boink her?

1463
01:18:14,954 --> 01:18:17,286
That would be a no.

1464
01:18:17,356 --> 01:18:19,620
Raise you hand
if your brother's a homo!

1465
01:18:20,960 --> 01:18:23,360
All right.
Keep in touch!

1466
01:18:27,800 --> 01:18:32,100
You believe that?
Not one taxi, not one.

1467
01:18:32,171 --> 01:18:34,639
Stupid town.
I gotta take the bus!

1468
01:18:34,707 --> 01:18:36,299
Dude, bus sucks!

1469
01:18:37,943 --> 01:18:40,969
Yes!
I am outta here!

1470
01:18:42,815 --> 01:18:46,649
So long, Sucktown!
Kiss my ass!

1471
01:18:48,287 --> 01:18:50,721
Hey, Mr. Bus Driver Man.

1472
01:18:50,790 --> 01:18:52,451
Hey...

1473
01:18:52,525 --> 01:18:56,017
pull my finger.
Come on, pull my finger.

1474
01:19:18,584 --> 01:19:21,985
- Aw!
- Yoo-hoo!

1475
01:19:22,054 --> 01:19:25,490
- Great.
- Jamie!

1476
01:19:25,558 --> 01:19:28,186
- Whoa, miss, miss. W-w-whoa.
- What? What, what, wha...

1477
01:19:28,260 --> 01:19:30,524
- what, Chris? What do you want?
- I just want to apologize.

1478
01:19:30,596 --> 01:19:32,461
I'm sorry.
I was out of line, okay?

1479
01:19:32,531 --> 01:19:34,863
- You're an asshole.
- Oh, my... I was...

1480
01:19:34,934 --> 01:19:37,425
I'm gonna get you a cab
and take you home.

1481
01:19:37,503 --> 01:19:40,631
- She's so sensitive!
- You blew it. I'm winning.

1482
01:19:40,706 --> 01:19:42,970
- You're the Devil.
- So go ahead, just go sleep it off.

1483
01:19:43,042 --> 01:19:45,033
You'll be right as rain
in the morning, brother.

1484
01:19:45,110 --> 01:19:47,977
Chris, you're drunk!
Go home!

1485
01:19:48,047 --> 01:19:50,572
I'm not drunk.
What's this?

1486
01:19:53,032 --> 01:19:54,169
"Simply Dusty"

1487
01:19:55,087 --> 01:19:57,078
Is there any other kind?
That's adorable.

1488
01:19:57,156 --> 01:19:59,090
Do you know what else
is adorable? You two.

1489
01:19:59,158 --> 01:20:02,025
Hey! Stop bringing Dusty
into your problems, okay?

1490
01:20:02,094 --> 01:20:04,028
Dusty and I are fine.

1491
01:20:04,096 --> 01:20:06,690
- Dusty and I are friends.
- Right!

1492
01:20:06,765 --> 01:20:09,529
- Not for too long, I hope.
- Yeah...

1493
01:20:09,602 --> 01:20:11,035
Wait, what?

1494
01:20:11,103 --> 01:20:12,934
Slow down.
What did you just say?

1495
01:20:13,005 --> 01:20:15,200
Jamie, listen, I've been
meaning to talk to you.

1496
01:20:15,274 --> 01:20:17,208
L... about our
relationship.

1497
01:20:17,276 --> 01:20:19,836
Maybe we could take
the next step or something?

1498
01:20:19,912 --> 01:20:21,379
Dusty, can I be honest with you?

1499
01:20:21,447 --> 01:20:24,075
- I think you're a really nice guy.
- Thank you.

1500
01:20:24,149 --> 01:20:26,413
I think you're funny
and charming and sweet,

1501
01:20:26,485 --> 01:20:29,477
and I just don't have
those feelings for you.

1502
01:20:29,555 --> 01:20:31,420
- You're kidding.
- No.

1503
01:20:36,028 --> 01:20:39,122
Okay, 'cause... cause I wrote you
that song and everything,

1504
01:20:39,198 --> 01:20:41,029
you know, and I worked
really hard on it

1505
01:20:41,100 --> 01:20:43,364
and what kind of girl would you be if you
didn't put out for the guy that wrote

1506
01:20:43,435 --> 01:20:45,426
you that song, you know what mean?

1507
01:20:47,873 --> 01:20:50,341
F-this. I'm mobile.

1508
01:20:55,948 --> 01:20:58,212
I'm gonna miss him!

1509
01:20:59,985 --> 01:21:01,445
What?

1510
01:21:04,990 --> 01:21:06,924
Get off me, Chris!
Why are you here?

1511
01:21:06,992 --> 01:21:08,687
Why do you keep
messing with my head?

1512
01:21:08,761 --> 01:21:10,752
I messed with your head
for three days.

1513
01:21:10,829 --> 01:21:13,798
You've been torturing me
since the sixth grade!

1514
01:21:13,866 --> 01:21:15,629
So that's what
this is about?

1515
01:21:15,701 --> 01:21:18,465
Because I wouldn't screw you
in high school? Get over yourself!

1516
01:21:18,537 --> 01:21:21,938
Oh, after years of you
being the biggest tease,

1517
01:21:22,007 --> 01:21:24,567
trust me,
I'm so over myself.

1518
01:21:24,643 --> 01:21:26,270
Oh, so now
I'm the tease.

1519
01:21:26,345 --> 01:21:27,869
I practically
throw myself at you

1520
01:21:27,947 --> 01:21:29,539
the other night
and you did nothing!

1521
01:21:29,615 --> 01:21:33,176
And now you know
how it feels.

1522
01:21:33,252 --> 01:21:35,117
I'm outta here.

1523
01:21:35,187 --> 01:21:37,485
Yeah, there you go.
Just walk away like you always do!

1524
01:21:37,556 --> 01:21:39,217
Oh, no no no.
I'm-I'm not walking away.

1525
01:21:39,291 --> 01:21:41,316
I'm running back
to my great life in L.A.!

1526
01:21:41,393 --> 01:21:43,793
- Great. Well, have fun.
- Oh, you have fun...

1527
01:21:43,862 --> 01:21:46,057
being the girl
who peaked in high school.

1528
01:21:47,240 --> 01:21:49,066
You slap like a cheerleader.

1529
01:21:49,134 --> 01:21:51,261
Bye, Chris.

1530
01:21:53,138 --> 01:21:55,106
And stay out!

1531
01:22:00,179 --> 01:22:01,806
I've always wanted
to say that.

1532
01:23:12,217 --> 01:23:13,707
How did you
get in here?

1533
01:23:13,786 --> 01:23:16,084
My bodyguard
let me in.

1534
01:23:16,155 --> 01:23:18,783
I was making cookies.

1535
01:23:18,857 --> 01:23:20,518
Oh, I was trying
to be all domesticated

1536
01:23:20,592 --> 01:23:22,822
like that skank you were
banging behind my back.

1537
01:23:22,895 --> 01:23:24,385
Please leave me alone.

1538
01:23:25,464 --> 01:23:27,398
No, sh-sh-sh-sh!

1539
01:23:27,466 --> 01:23:29,093
Hugs and kisses!

1540
01:23:29,168 --> 01:23:32,467
It's all good, baby,
it's all good.

1541
01:23:32,538 --> 01:23:35,598
By making me jealous on purpose
you inspire me to write the best songs,

1542
01:23:35,674 --> 01:23:37,403
you know,
full of angst and hate!

1543
01:23:37,476 --> 01:23:40,206
You like that.
You and I are gonna be

1544
01:23:40,279 --> 01:23:42,270
the greatest musical
manager team

1545
01:23:42,347 --> 01:23:44,679
since Jessica Simpson
and her father...

1546
01:23:44,750 --> 01:23:46,775
only we get to "mreow"
and they can't,

1547
01:23:46,852 --> 01:23:49,320
'cause it's illegal.
I looked it up.

1548
01:23:49,388 --> 01:23:52,983
This is the new and improved
"Forgiveness."

1549
01:23:59,064 --> 01:24:02,795
# Forgiveness #

1550
01:24:02,868 --> 01:24:06,031
# Is more than
sayin' sorry #

1551
01:24:06,105 --> 01:24:08,539
Are you sorry?
Ha ha!

1552
01:24:10,309 --> 01:24:12,243
# Forgiveness. #

1553
01:24:14,913 --> 01:24:16,608
- No.
- No?

1554
01:24:16,682 --> 01:24:19,617
- No more.
- But I've forgiven you!

1555
01:24:19,685 --> 01:24:21,812
- It's just like the song...
- Sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh...

1556
01:24:21,887 --> 01:24:25,186
This isn't about you.

1557
01:24:25,257 --> 01:24:27,623
It's cool, you can have other girls.
I like girls.

1558
01:24:27,693 --> 01:24:29,490
Darla!

1559
01:24:29,561 --> 01:24:31,688
I don't want other girls.

1560
01:24:31,764 --> 01:24:33,356
I want one girl.

1561
01:24:34,700 --> 01:24:36,725
- That's not you.
- Hmph.

1562
01:24:42,341 --> 01:24:43,808
Look.
I'll call...

1563
01:24:46,712 --> 01:24:48,179
Ouch.

1564
01:24:52,217 --> 01:24:54,549
- Why don't you like me?
- It's a little hard to answer

1565
01:24:54,620 --> 01:24:56,554
with a taser in my balls!

1566
01:24:56,622 --> 01:24:59,386
This is about Santa's
little whore, isn't it?

1567
01:25:03,061 --> 01:25:05,029
Yeah, it's go time.

1568
01:25:05,097 --> 01:25:06,394
Hey, hey, hey!
It's not go time!

1569
01:25:06,465 --> 01:25:08,399
This isn't how it works,
Samantha.

1570
01:25:08,467 --> 01:25:11,925
You can't force or-or torture
someone into liking you.

1571
01:25:12,004 --> 01:25:13,562
The big speech.

1572
01:25:13,639 --> 01:25:15,368
No! You just have to put
yourself out there

1573
01:25:15,440 --> 01:25:16,372
and hope that they
like you back.

1574
01:25:16,441 --> 01:25:18,500
This isn't a game!
This is my life!

1575
01:25:18,577 --> 01:25:20,442
Oh, yeah, well,
this is my life!

1576
01:25:20,512 --> 01:25:22,377
Okay? I'm sorry.

1577
01:25:22,447 --> 01:25:25,473
I'm not the most
boring person ever!

1578
01:25:25,551 --> 01:25:27,246
Okay? I'm sorry
I'm not poor!

1579
01:25:28,287 --> 01:25:30,050
I'm sorry...

1580
01:25:30,122 --> 01:25:33,455
I'm sorry I don't
have a fat ass!

1581
01:25:33,525 --> 01:25:36,221
I'm sorry I'm not...
where're you going?

1582
01:25:36,295 --> 01:25:40,925
# Missed the last
train home #

1583
01:25:44,403 --> 01:25:49,807
# Birds pass by to tell me
that I'm not alone #

1584
01:25:49,875 --> 01:25:53,208
# Well, I'm pushing myself
to finish this part... #

1585
01:25:53,278 --> 01:25:54,802
Hey! Hey,
where is she?

1586
01:25:54,880 --> 01:25:59,613
# I handle a lot
walking on this #

1587
01:25:59,685 --> 01:26:02,882
# It's in your eyes,
open your eyes #

1588
01:26:02,955 --> 01:26:06,823
# Open eyes,
open your eyes #

1589
01:26:06,892 --> 01:26:08,587
# Open your eyes #

1590
01:26:08,660 --> 01:26:10,525
# Open your eyes. #

1591
01:26:10,596 --> 01:26:12,530
Hi.

1592
01:26:12,598 --> 01:26:14,793
Jamie.
Look, Jamie!

1593
01:26:16,635 --> 01:26:18,728
I said a lot of really crappy
things the other night

1594
01:26:18,804 --> 01:26:21,773
and I'm sorry about that.

1595
01:26:21,840 --> 01:26:24,308
I haven't been a very good friend
to you and I'm sorry, okay?

1596
01:26:24,376 --> 01:26:28,369
I just... the truth is
I'm-I'm afraid to be your friend

1597
01:26:28,447 --> 01:26:30,312
'cause I'm always
gonna want more.

1598
01:26:31,416 --> 01:26:33,077
But then I got
to thinking that-that

1599
01:26:33,151 --> 01:26:35,915
I'd rather have you in my life
as a friend than not at all.

1600
01:26:39,324 --> 01:26:41,258
You know what?
That's a lie too.

1601
01:26:45,631 --> 01:26:47,462
Why are you back here?

1602
01:26:49,434 --> 01:26:51,265
Because I want
to take you on a date.

1603
01:26:53,272 --> 01:26:56,070
And I don't care if it's
in the day or at night

1604
01:26:56,141 --> 01:26:59,508
or whenever, as long
as it's a real date.

1605
01:26:59,578 --> 01:27:02,843
And I want to tell you how beautiful
I think you are inside and out.

1606
01:27:03,949 --> 01:27:06,144
And I want to have
babies with you

1607
01:27:06,218 --> 01:27:09,244
and I want to marry you
and I love you.

1608
01:27:10,656 --> 01:27:12,749
Jamie, I always have.

1609
01:27:18,864 --> 01:27:20,991
Sorry. Just,...

1610
01:27:21,066 --> 01:27:23,034
20 years all at once!

1611
01:27:45,324 --> 01:27:46,348
Unbelievable!

1612
01:27:46,425 --> 01:27:48,484
Suckster's making out
with Mrs. P!

1613
01:27:48,560 --> 01:27:50,755
What is she thinking?

1614
01:27:50,829 --> 01:27:53,957
- Hey, Sarah, do you want my last cookie?
- Oh, thanks, Brett!

1615
01:27:54,032 --> 01:27:56,159
Joey, do you want
some of my cookie?

1616
01:27:56,234 --> 01:27:57,826
Don't mind if I do.

1617
01:27:57,903 --> 01:28:01,066
- You're such a good friend, Brett.
- The bestest!

1618
01:28:02,507 --> 01:28:03,303
Shit!

1619
01:28:03,642 --> 01:28:06,270
# I swear #

1620
01:28:06,345 --> 01:28:09,280
# By the moon
and the stars #

1621
01:28:09,348 --> 01:28:12,146
# In the skies #

1622
01:28:12,217 --> 01:28:15,015
# I'll be there #

1623
01:28:15,087 --> 01:28:17,749
# And I swear #

1624
01:28:17,823 --> 01:28:19,882
# Like the shadow #

1625
01:28:19,958 --> 01:28:23,860
# That's by your side #

1626
01:28:23,929 --> 01:28:27,296
# I'll be there #

1627
01:28:27,366 --> 01:28:30,494
# For better or worse #

1628
01:28:30,569 --> 01:28:33,470
# Till death
do us part #

1629
01:28:33,538 --> 01:28:38,635
# I'll love you with every
beat of my heart #

1630
01:28:38,710 --> 01:28:42,202
# And I swear #

1631
01:28:52,424 --> 01:28:55,985
# I'll give you
everything #

1632
01:28:56,061 --> 01:28:58,188
# I can #

1633
01:28:58,263 --> 01:29:00,128
# I'll build your dreams #

1634
01:29:00,198 --> 01:29:03,759
# With these two hands #

1635
01:29:03,835 --> 01:29:06,565
# We'll hang
some memories #

1636
01:29:06,638 --> 01:29:10,404
# On the walls #

1637
01:29:10,475 --> 01:29:12,943
- # And when #
- # And when #

1638
01:29:13,011 --> 01:29:17,948
# Just the two
of us are there #

1639
01:29:18,016 --> 01:29:20,314
# You won't
have to ask #

1640
01:29:20,385 --> 01:29:23,980
# If I still care #

1641
01:29:24,056 --> 01:29:27,617
# 'Cause as the time
turns the page #

1642
01:29:27,692 --> 01:29:32,857
# My love won't age
at all #

1643
01:29:32,931 --> 01:29:36,025
- # And I swear #
- # And I swear #

1644
01:29:36,101 --> 01:29:38,934
# By the moon
and the stars #

1645
01:29:39,004 --> 01:29:41,734
# In the skies #

1646
01:29:41,807 --> 01:29:44,833
- # I'll be there #
- # I'll be there #

1647
01:29:44,910 --> 01:29:47,504
- # And I swear #
- # And I swear #

1648
01:29:47,579 --> 01:29:53,211
# Like the shadow
that's by your side #

1649
01:29:53,285 --> 01:29:56,880
- # I'll be there #
- # I'll be there #

1650
01:29:56,955 --> 01:29:59,719
# For better
or worse #

1651
01:29:59,791 --> 01:30:02,555
# Till death
do us part #

1652
01:30:02,627 --> 01:30:07,963
# I'll love you with
every beat of my heart #

1653
01:30:08,033 --> 01:30:11,696
- # And I swear #
- # Oh, yeah #

1654
01:30:22,314 --> 01:30:24,782
# And I swear #

1655
01:30:24,850 --> 01:30:27,910
# By the moon
and the stars #

1656
01:30:27,986 --> 01:30:30,477
# In the skies #

1657
01:30:30,555 --> 01:30:33,547
- # I'll be there #
- # I'll be there #

1658
01:30:33,625 --> 01:30:36,219
# And I swear #

1659
01:30:36,294 --> 01:30:38,319
# Like the shadow #

1660
01:30:38,396 --> 01:30:42,264
- # That's by your side #
- # That's by your side #

1661
01:30:42,334 --> 01:30:45,565
- # I'll be there #
- # I'll be there #

1662
01:30:45,637 --> 01:30:49,004
- # For better or worse #
- # Better or worse #

1663
01:30:49,074 --> 01:30:51,872
- # Till death do us part #
- # Oh no #

1664
01:30:51,943 --> 01:30:57,108
# I'll love you with
every beat of my heart #

1665
01:30:57,182 --> 01:31:00,174
# And I swear #

1666
01:31:00,252 --> 01:31:03,312
# I swear #

1667
01:31:03,388 --> 01:31:08,223
# Oh, whoa, I... #

1668
01:31:08,293 --> 01:31:11,421
# Swear. #

1669
01:31:11,496 --> 01:31:12,520
Mike!

1670
01:31:22,274 --> 01:31:25,368
# Forgiveness #

1671
01:31:26,611 --> 01:31:30,012
# Is more than
saying sorry #

1672
01:31:30,081 --> 01:31:34,040
# Sorry sorry sorry #

1673
01:31:34,119 --> 01:31:38,249
# Forgiveness #

1674
01:31:38,323 --> 01:31:42,191
# Means accepting
people's flaws #

1675
01:31:42,260 --> 01:31:47,197
# Flaws flaws flaws #

1676
01:31:47,265 --> 01:31:49,756
# To forgive is divine #

1677
01:31:49,834 --> 01:31:53,361
# So let's have
a glass of wine #

1678
01:31:53,438 --> 01:31:56,032
# And have makeup sex #

1679
01:31:56,107 --> 01:31:58,041
# Until the end of #

1680
01:31:58,109 --> 01:32:01,044
# Time #

1681
01:32:04,482 --> 01:32:08,748
# Forgiveness #

1682
01:32:08,820 --> 01:32:12,256
# Does not mean
compromising #

1683
01:32:16,795 --> 01:32:19,593
# Let's forgive
and forget #

1684
01:32:19,664 --> 01:32:22,792
# And solve this
African debt #

1685
01:32:22,867 --> 01:32:25,836
# Just like
the Cheshire Cat #

1686
01:32:25,904 --> 01:32:29,305
# Who says, "Mreow!
You're running out of time!" #

1687
01:32:29,374 --> 01:32:34,402
# Time time time time time,
wreeow! #

1688
01:33:01,139 --> 01:33:02,629
# Forgiveness #

1689
01:33:02,707 --> 01:33:04,572
You'll always be
fat to me, Chris!

1690
01:33:07,479 --> 01:33:08,878
# Forgiveness #

1691
01:33:08,947 --> 01:33:11,507
God damn it!
Come on, Dusty.

1692
01:33:13,551 --> 01:33:15,485
# Forgiveness #

1693
01:33:15,553 --> 01:33:17,987
Not happy!

1694
01:33:19,557 --> 01:33:21,548
# Forgiveness #

1695
01:33:21,626 --> 01:33:26,563
Hello, Joyce? Joyce?

1696
01:33:26,631 --> 01:33:28,531
Oh my God!

1697
01:33:31,703 --> 01:33:34,763
Then said Jesus,
"Father, forgive them

1698
01:33:34,839 --> 01:33:38,036
for they know
not what they do."

1699
01:33:38,109 --> 01:33:41,806
If you haven't forgiven yourself
something, how can you forgive others?

1700
01:33:41,880 --> 01:33:43,404
I won't apologize.

1701
01:33:43,481 --> 01:33:45,278
I don't forgive you.

1702
01:33:45,350 --> 01:33:48,376
You can forgive,
but you can't forget.

1703
01:33:49,621 --> 01:33:51,589
Where are you?

1704
01:33:55,994 --> 01:33:58,724
# Forgiveness #

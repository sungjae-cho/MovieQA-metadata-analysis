1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,074


2
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:29,527
<i>Mutation: It is the key to our evolution.</i>

3
00:00:29,655 --> 00:00:35,409
<i>It has enabled us to evolve
into the dominant species on the planet.</i>

4
00:00:35,536 --> 00:00:40,079
<i>This process normally takes
thousands and thousands of years.</i>

5
00:00:40,207 --> 00:00:44,620
<i>But every few hundred millennia,
evolution leaps forward.</i>

6
00:04:28,185 --> 00:04:30,177
Niagara Falls,

7
00:04:30,312 --> 00:04:32,554
up the Canadian Rockies,

8
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:36,639
and then it's only
a few hundred miles to Anchorage.

9
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:40,608
- Won't it kinda be cold?
- Well, that's the point, stupid.

10
00:04:40,739 --> 00:04:43,775
Otherwise it wouldn't be an adventure.

11
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:46,696
And when are you gonna do this?

12
00:04:48,747 --> 00:04:51,534
I don't know.

13
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:55,035
After high school. Before college.

14
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:41,414
- Marie!
- I don't know what happened.

15
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:45,464
- David?
- I don't know... I just touched him.

16
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:48,549
- I didn't mean...
- Call an ambulance!

17
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:51,599
We only touched. Just get away from me!

18
00:05:51,726 --> 00:05:55,142
- Will you call an ambulance?!
- Don't touch me!

19
00:05:56,231 --> 00:06:02,150
We are now seeing the beginnings
of another stage of human evolution.

20
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:07,818
These mutations manifest at puberty, often
triggered by periods of emotional stress.

21
00:06:07,951 --> 00:06:11,236
Thank you, Miss Grey.
It was quite educational.

22
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:15,700
However, it fails to address the issue
that is the focus of this hearing.

23
00:06:15,834 --> 00:06:19,582
Three words: Are mutants dangerous?

24
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:25,466
That's unfair, Senator Kelly. The wrong
person driving a car can be dangerous.

25
00:06:25,593 --> 00:06:29,294
- We do license people to drive.
- Yes, but not to live.

26
00:06:30,015 --> 00:06:35,139
Senator, mutants who've come forward
and revealed themselves publicly

27
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:38,853
have been met with fear,
hostility, even violence.

28
00:06:38,982 --> 00:06:41,437
It is because of that hostility

29
00:06:41,568 --> 00:06:45,779
that I am urging the Senate
to vote against mutant registration.

30
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:49,274
- To force mutants to expose themselves...
- Expose themselves?

31
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:54,118
What do mutants have to hide that makes
them so afraid to identify themselves?

32
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:58,459
- I didn't say they were hiding.
- Let me show you what is being hidden.

33
00:06:58,585 --> 00:07:04,338
I have here a list of names of identified
mutants living right here in the United States.

34
00:07:04,466 --> 00:07:08,250
- Senator Kelly...
- A girl in Illinois who walks through walls.

35
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:12,965
What's to stop her from walking
into a bank vault? Or into the White House?

36
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:18,473
<i>Or into their houses? And there are even
rumours of mutants so powerful</i>

37
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:21,771
that they can enter our minds
and control our thoughts,

38
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:24,355
taking away our God-given free will.

39
00:07:24,486 --> 00:07:29,194
The American people deserve the right
to decide whether they want their children

40
00:07:29,324 --> 00:07:33,321
to be in school with mutants.
To be taught by mutants.

41
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:40,460
Ladies and gentlemen,
the truth is that mutants are very real.

42
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:46,207
And they are among us.
We must know who they are,

43
00:07:46,341 --> 00:07:50,385
and, above all,
we must know what they can do.

44
00:08:14,202 --> 00:08:16,241
Eric.

45
00:08:18,623 --> 00:08:20,662
What are you doing here?

46
00:08:20,792 --> 00:08:25,039
Why do you ask questions to which
you already know the answers?

47
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:29,500
- Don't give up on them, Eric.
- What would you have me do, Charles?

48
00:08:29,634 --> 00:08:33,050
I've heard these arguments before.

49
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:37,391
It was a long time ago.
Mankind has evolved since then.

50
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:41,101
Yes... into us.

51
00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:53,107
Are you sneaking around in here, Charles?
Whatever are you looking for?

52
00:08:59,414 --> 00:09:01,490
I'm looking for hope.

53
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:08,913
I will bring you hope, old friend.
And I ask only one thing in return.

54
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:13,381
Don't get in my way.

55
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:21,345
We are the future, Charles, not them!
They no longer matter.

56
00:09:35,491 --> 00:09:37,531
This is it.

57
00:09:45,334 --> 00:09:49,878
Where are we? I thought you said you were
gonna take me as far as Laughlin City.

58
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:52,045
<i>This is Laughlin City.</i>

59
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:28,368
Gentlemen, in all my years
I've never seen anything like this.

60
00:10:30,087 --> 00:10:34,500
Are you gonna let this man
walk away with your money?

61
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:35,962
No!

62
00:10:36,093 --> 00:10:38,929
I'll fight him!

63
00:10:40,681 --> 00:10:43,351
Ladies and gentlemen,

64
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:45,515
our saviour!

65
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:49,138
Don't hit him in the balls.

66
00:10:49,273 --> 00:10:53,686
- You said anything goes.
- Anything goes, but he'll take it personal.

67
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:07,414
You idiot!

68
00:11:20,137 --> 00:11:26,140
Ladies and gentlemen,
tonight's winner and still King of the Cage,

69
00:11:26,269 --> 00:11:28,594
the Wolverine.

70
00:11:57,508 --> 00:12:02,503
You want something new, honey?
Or are you sticking with water?

71
00:12:11,522 --> 00:12:13,562
I'll have a beer.

72
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:27,328
<i>Ellis Island, once the arrival point
for American immigrants,</i>

73
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:29,578
<i>is opening its doors again.</i>

74
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:33,787
<i>Preparations are nearly completed
for the United Nations World Summit.</i>

75
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:40,717
<i>The event promises to be the largest
single gathering of world leaders in history.</i>

76
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:46,264
<i>Leaders will discuss issues ranging from
the world압 economy and weapons treaties,</i>

77
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:50,851
<i>to the mutant phenomenon
and its impact on our world stage.</i>

78
00:12:50,978 --> 00:12:54,727
<i>American legislators contend
that debate over mutant issues</i>

79
00:12:54,857 --> 00:13:00,278
<i>should be the primary focus of what is,
on the surface at least, a diplomatic affair.</i>

80
00:13:00,404 --> 00:13:04,354
- You owe me some money.
- Stu, let's not do this.

81
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:08,323
No man takes a beating like that
without a mark to show for it.

82
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:11,823
- Come on, this isn't worth it.
- I know what you are.

83
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:16,915
You lost your money.
You keep this up, you lose something else.

84
00:13:17,546 --> 00:13:19,586
Look out!

85
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:34,428
Get outta my bar, freak!

86
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:27,626
- What the hell are you doin'?
- I'm sorry. I needed a ride.

87
00:15:27,759 --> 00:15:31,342
- I thought you might help me.
- Get out!

88
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:34,339
- Where am I supposed to go?
- I don't know.

89
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:37,725
- You don't know or you don't care?
- Pick one.

90
00:15:40,647 --> 00:15:43,767
- I saved your life!
- No, you didn't.

91
00:15:58,749 --> 00:16:02,082
You don't have anything to eat, do you?

92
00:16:23,607 --> 00:16:25,646
I'm Rogue.

93
00:16:30,989 --> 00:16:35,034
Were you in the army?
Doesn't that mean you were in the army?

94
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:45,206
- Wow!
- What?

95
00:16:47,798 --> 00:16:50,834
<i>- Suddenly my life isn't bad.
- If you prefer the road...</i>

96
00:16:50,968 --> 00:16:54,383
No! It looks great.

97
00:16:57,516 --> 00:17:00,185
It looks cosy.

98
00:17:06,817 --> 00:17:09,983
Put your hands on the heater.

99
00:17:11,321 --> 00:17:14,358
- I'm not gonna hurt you, kid.
- It's nothing personal.

100
00:17:14,491 --> 00:17:17,860
It's just when people touch my skin,
something happens.

101
00:17:17,994 --> 00:17:19,821
What?

102
00:17:19,955 --> 00:17:22,624
I don't know. They just get hurt.

103
00:17:24,876 --> 00:17:27,249
Fair enough.

104
00:17:30,173 --> 00:17:33,258
When they come out, does it hurt?

105
00:17:36,513 --> 00:17:38,969
Every time.

106
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:45,009
So what kind of a name is Rogue?

107
00:17:46,189 --> 00:17:49,641
I don't know.
What kind of a name is Wolverine?

108
00:17:54,656 --> 00:17:56,898
My name's Logan.

109
00:17:58,326 --> 00:18:00,568
Marie.

110
00:18:02,664 --> 00:18:06,828
- You should wear your seat belt.
- Look, kid, I don't need advice on...

111
00:19:12,859 --> 00:19:15,433
You all right?

112
00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:18,737
- Kid, are you all right?
- I'm stuck!

113
00:21:03,678 --> 00:21:07,462
Weren't you supposed to bring
someone back with you?

114
00:21:19,986 --> 00:21:22,192
- What happened?
- They knew.

115
00:21:31,247 --> 00:21:32,955
Charles...

116
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:49,421
- Where is the mutant now?
- With them.

117
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:56,604
I have made the first move.
That is all they know.

118
00:21:58,024 --> 00:22:02,567
Come, the UN summit is approaching.
Time for our little test.

119
00:23:14,433 --> 00:23:16,925
Where's he going?

120
00:23:42,086 --> 00:23:44,755
Where are you going?

121
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:53,719
Over here!

122
00:24:19,916 --> 00:24:22,489
- Where are you going?
- This way!

123
00:24:22,627 --> 00:24:24,666
He's over there.

124
00:24:30,968 --> 00:24:33,293
Let go! What's your hurry?

125
00:24:38,476 --> 00:24:40,515
Over here!

126
00:24:57,745 --> 00:25:00,236
Good morning, Logan.

127
00:25:00,373 --> 00:25:05,200
So, I'd like your definitions of weak and
strong anthropic principles on Wednesday.

128
00:25:05,336 --> 00:25:07,375
That'll be all.

129
00:25:13,969 --> 00:25:16,211
- Bye, Professor.
- Bye, Kitty.

130
00:25:20,768 --> 00:25:22,807
Physics.

131
00:25:23,270 --> 00:25:26,390
I'm Charles Xavier.
Would you like some breakfast?

132
00:25:26,524 --> 00:25:29,228
- Where am I?
- Westchester, New York.

133
00:25:30,277 --> 00:25:34,192
You were attacked. My people
brought you here for medical attention.

134
00:25:34,323 --> 00:25:38,451
- I don't need medical attention.
- Yes, of course.

135
00:25:40,037 --> 00:25:42,575
- Where's the girl?
- Rogue's here. She's fine.

136
00:25:42,706 --> 00:25:44,913
Really?

137
00:25:46,168 --> 00:25:51,293
Ah. Logan, I'd like you to meet Ororo Monroe,
also called Storm.

138
00:25:51,423 --> 00:25:54,508
This is Scott Summers, also called Cyclops.

139
00:25:57,555 --> 00:26:00,010
They saved your life.

140
00:26:01,392 --> 00:26:04,891
I believe you've already met Dr Jean Grey.

141
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:10,145
You're in my school for the gifted. For
mutants. You'll be safe here from Magneto.

142
00:26:10,276 --> 00:26:13,395
- What's a magneto?
- A very powerful mutant,

143
00:26:13,529 --> 00:26:17,229
who believes a war is brewing
between mutants and the rest of humanity.

144
00:26:17,366 --> 00:26:20,118
I've been following his activities
for some time.

145
00:26:20,244 --> 00:26:23,827
The man who attacked you
is an associate of his called Sabretooth.

146
00:26:23,956 --> 00:26:25,747
Sabretooth?

147
00:26:26,917 --> 00:26:29,455
Storm.

148
00:26:30,337 --> 00:26:33,291
What do they call you? Wheels?

149
00:26:34,758 --> 00:26:38,377
This is the stupidest thing I've ever heard.

150
00:26:39,638 --> 00:26:42,509
And Cyclops, right?

151
00:26:42,641 --> 00:26:45,097
You wanna get outta my way?

152
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:49,520
Logan, it's been almost 15 years, hasn't it?

153
00:26:50,274 --> 00:26:53,441
Living from day to day,
moving from place to place,

154
00:26:53,569 --> 00:26:56,404
with no memory of who or what you are.

155
00:26:56,530 --> 00:26:58,855
Shut up!

156
00:26:58,991 --> 00:27:04,151
Give me a chance.
I may be able to help you find some answers.

157
00:27:05,581 --> 00:27:08,831
- How do you know?
- You're not the only one with gifts.

158
00:27:08,959 --> 00:27:11,284
- Where are you going?
- Where's he going?

159
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:13,460
Over here!

160
00:27:18,093 --> 00:27:19,504
What is this place?

161
00:27:21,597 --> 00:27:26,140
Anonymity is a mutant's first defence
against the world's hostility.

162
00:27:26,268 --> 00:27:28,308
Hey, no powers!

163
00:27:29,229 --> 00:27:33,559
To the public, we're merely
a school for gifted youngsters.

164
00:27:33,692 --> 00:27:37,560
Cyclops, Storm and Jean
were some of my first students.

165
00:27:37,696 --> 00:27:41,528
I protected them,
taught them to control their powers

166
00:27:41,658 --> 00:27:45,241
and, in time, teach others to do the same.

167
00:27:46,038 --> 00:27:49,786
The students are mostly runaways -
frightened, alone.

168
00:27:49,917 --> 00:27:54,875
Some with gifts so extreme they're a danger
to themselves and those around them.

169
00:27:55,005 --> 00:27:56,713
Like your friend Rogue.

170
00:27:56,840 --> 00:28:01,633
Incapable of physical human contact,
probably for the rest of her life.

171
00:28:01,762 --> 00:28:06,887
And yet here she is with others her own age,
learning, being accepted,

172
00:28:07,017 --> 00:28:09,057
not feared.

173
00:28:19,571 --> 00:28:22,062
- John!
- Sorry.

174
00:28:26,161 --> 00:28:28,450
I'm Bobby.

175
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:30,869
- What's your name?
- Rogue.

176
00:28:30,999 --> 00:28:33,870
- What'll happen to her?
- That's up to her.

177
00:28:34,002 --> 00:28:38,047
Rejoin the world as an educated
young woman, or stay on to teach others.

178
00:28:38,173 --> 00:28:41,957
To become what the children
have affectionately called "X-Men".

179
00:28:42,094 --> 00:28:44,466
Welcome to Mutant High.

180
00:28:46,682 --> 00:28:49,683
But the school is merely our public face.

181
00:28:49,810 --> 00:28:54,388
The lower levels, however,
are an entirely different matter.

182
00:28:57,901 --> 00:29:02,528
When I was a boy I discovered I had
the power to control people's minds.

183
00:29:02,656 --> 00:29:05,277
Make them think or do whatever I wanted.

184
00:29:05,409 --> 00:29:09,489
When I was 17
I met a young man named Eric Lensherr.

185
00:29:09,621 --> 00:29:15,410
He, too, had an unusual power. He could
create magnetic fields and control metal.

186
00:29:15,544 --> 00:29:21,547
Believing that humanity would never
accept us, he grew angry and vengeful.

187
00:29:23,093 --> 00:29:25,762
He became Magneto.

188
00:29:26,888 --> 00:29:30,340
There are mutants out there
with incredible powers, Logan.

189
00:29:30,475 --> 00:29:33,891
And many who do not share
my respect for mankind.

190
00:29:34,021 --> 00:29:38,232
If no one is equipped to oppose them,
humanity's days could be over.

191
00:29:38,358 --> 00:29:40,517
I'll make a deal with you.

192
00:29:40,652 --> 00:29:44,732
Give me 48 hours to find out
what Magneto wants with you,

193
00:29:44,865 --> 00:29:47,735
and I give you my word
that I will use all my power

194
00:29:47,868 --> 00:29:53,110
to help you piece together what you've lost,
and what you're looking for.

195
00:30:21,276 --> 00:30:25,855
Senator, you favour gun registration, yes?
Some of these so-called children

196
00:30:25,989 --> 00:30:30,900
possess more than 10 times
the destructive force of any handgun.

197
00:30:31,036 --> 00:30:35,283
No, I don't see a difference.
All I see are weapons in our schools.

198
00:30:35,415 --> 00:30:38,286
Well, that's fair enough. All right.

199
00:30:38,418 --> 00:30:40,245
So?

200
00:30:40,378 --> 00:30:43,961
It's gonna be close.
A vote this loaded is always close.

201
00:30:44,091 --> 00:30:47,257
What about the UN summit?
The world will be watching.

202
00:30:47,385 --> 00:30:51,798
- Maybe you could use it to your advantage.
- We're Americans, Henry.

203
00:30:51,932 --> 00:30:55,550
Let the rest of the damn world
deal with mutants in their own way.

204
00:30:55,685 --> 00:30:58,852
You know this situation? These mutants?

205
00:31:00,107 --> 00:31:05,646
People like this Jean Grey?
If it were up to me, I'd lock 'em all away.

206
00:31:07,197 --> 00:31:09,439
It's a war.

207
00:31:09,574 --> 00:31:12,694
It's the reason people like me exist.

208
00:31:20,043 --> 00:31:22,368
Where the hell are we?

209
00:31:32,305 --> 00:31:34,262
Pilot!

210
00:31:37,018 --> 00:31:41,811
People like you are the reason
I was afraid to go to school as a child.

211
00:32:13,096 --> 00:32:15,136
I'm sorry.

212
00:32:16,224 --> 00:32:19,095
- For what?
- If I hurt you.

213
00:32:28,653 --> 00:32:32,568
So... couldn't wait
to get my shirt off again, huh?

214
00:32:49,341 --> 00:32:52,092
The metal is an alloy called adamantium.

215
00:32:52,218 --> 00:32:57,889
Supposedly indestructible. It's been
surgically grafted to his entire skeleton.

216
00:32:58,016 --> 00:33:01,219
How could he have survived
a procedure like that?

217
00:33:01,353 --> 00:33:08,648
His mutation. He has uncharted regenerative
capability which enables him to heal rapidly.

218
00:33:08,777 --> 00:33:12,192
This also makes his age
impossible to determine.

219
00:33:12,322 --> 00:33:16,106
He could very well be older than you,
Professor.

220
00:33:16,242 --> 00:33:19,077
- Who did this to him?
- He doesn't know.

221
00:33:19,204 --> 00:33:22,620
Nor does he remember anything
about his life before it happened.

222
00:33:22,749 --> 00:33:27,411
Experimentation on mutants.
It's not unheard of.

223
00:33:28,213 --> 00:33:31,214
But I've never seen anything like this before.

224
00:33:31,341 --> 00:33:33,748
What do you think Magneto want with him?

225
00:33:33,885 --> 00:33:37,586
I'm not entirely sure it's him Magneto wants.

226
00:34:01,955 --> 00:34:05,158
Toad has a wicked tongue, Senator.

227
00:34:05,291 --> 00:34:07,331
Just like you.

228
00:34:13,675 --> 00:34:15,916
Who are you people? Where's Henry?

229
00:34:16,052 --> 00:34:19,801
Mr Guyrich has been dead
for some time, Senator.

230
00:34:19,931 --> 00:34:24,676
But I've had Mystique here keep you
company. She takes so many shapes.

231
00:34:24,811 --> 00:34:28,144
Whatever you do to me, you'll make me right.

232
00:34:28,273 --> 00:34:32,140
Every word I've spoken will be confirmed.

233
00:34:35,071 --> 00:34:40,410
Are you a God-fearing man, Senator?
It's such a strange phrase.

234
00:34:40,535 --> 00:34:43,536
I've always thought of God as a teacher.

235
00:34:43,663 --> 00:34:47,246
As a bringer of light,
wisdom and understanding.

236
00:34:47,375 --> 00:34:51,538
You see,
I think what you really are afraid of is me.

237
00:34:52,964 --> 00:34:55,965
Me and my kind.
The brotherhood of mutants.

238
00:34:58,970 --> 00:35:05,423
It's not so surprising, really. Mankind has
always feared what it doesn't understand.

239
00:35:07,103 --> 00:35:12,310
Well, don't fear God, Senator,
and certainly don't fear me.

240
00:35:14,068 --> 00:35:16,108
Not any more.

241
00:35:17,947 --> 00:35:22,823
- What do you intend to do to me?
- Let's just say God works too slowly.

242
00:36:38,361 --> 00:36:40,934
I think you'll be comfortable here.

243
00:36:41,072 --> 00:36:44,986
- Where's your room?
- With Scott, down the hall.

244
00:36:46,077 --> 00:36:49,161
Is that your gift? Putting up with that guy?

245
00:36:49,288 --> 00:36:52,989
Actually I'm telekinetic.
I can move things with my mind.

246
00:36:53,125 --> 00:36:56,210
Really? What kinds of things?

247
00:36:57,129 --> 00:36:59,087
All kinds of things.

248
00:37:00,508 --> 00:37:03,425
- I also have telepathic ability.
- Like your professor?

249
00:37:03,553 --> 00:37:08,594
Nowhere near that powerful.
But he's teaching me to develop it.

250
00:37:08,724 --> 00:37:10,764
I'm sure he is.

251
00:37:12,562 --> 00:37:14,684
- So read my mind.
- I'd rather not.

252
00:37:14,814 --> 00:37:19,226
- Come on. You afraid you might like it?
- I doubt it.

253
00:37:41,173 --> 00:37:43,795
What do you see?

254
00:37:43,926 --> 00:37:45,800
Scott!

255
00:37:49,682 --> 00:37:51,721
Good night, Logan.

256
00:38:00,109 --> 00:38:02,434
You gonna tell me
to stay away from your girl?

257
00:38:02,570 --> 00:38:05,571
If I had to do that, she wouldn't be my girl.

258
00:38:05,698 --> 00:38:09,861
Then I guess you've got nothing
to worry about, do you... Cyclops?

259
00:38:10,244 --> 00:38:14,242
It mustjust burn you up
that a boy like me saved your life, huh?

260
00:38:14,373 --> 00:38:17,991
You oughta be careful.
I might not be there next time.

261
00:38:18,127 --> 00:38:21,710
Oh, and Logan, stay away from my girl.

262
00:38:56,707 --> 00:38:58,747
Logan?

263
00:39:07,510 --> 00:39:10,629
Logan! Logan, wake up.

264
00:39:44,755 --> 00:39:46,795
Help me!

265
00:39:48,842 --> 00:39:51,796
Somebody, help!

266
00:40:22,710 --> 00:40:24,749
Scott, grab a pillow.

267
00:40:27,214 --> 00:40:29,752
It was an accident.

268
00:40:39,309 --> 00:40:42,145
- Logan?
- What happened?

269
00:40:43,564 --> 00:40:46,849
- Is she all right?
- She'll be all right.

270
00:40:48,235 --> 00:40:51,402
- What did she do to me?
- When Rogue touches someone,

271
00:40:51,530 --> 00:40:54,282
she takes their energy, their life force.

272
00:40:54,408 --> 00:40:57,824
In the case of mutants,
she absorbs their gifts for a while.

273
00:40:57,953 --> 00:41:00,491
In your case, your ability to heal.

274
00:41:03,459 --> 00:41:09,579
- It felt like she almost killed me.
- If she'd held out any longer, she could have.

275
00:42:03,727 --> 00:42:07,143
How are we feeling, Senator?
Advanced, I hope.

276
00:42:24,456 --> 00:42:26,912
What the hell have you done to me?

277
00:42:27,042 --> 00:42:31,087
Senator, this is pointless.
Where would you go?

278
00:42:31,213 --> 00:42:33,620
Who would take you in,
now you're one of us?

279
00:43:30,439 --> 00:43:34,816
Tommy, let it go! Tommy, please let it go!

280
00:43:34,943 --> 00:43:37,778
I'm telling Mommy.

281
00:43:51,209 --> 00:43:53,879
Is that a mutant?

282
00:43:59,134 --> 00:44:03,381
<i>...UN summit. With the leaders
of over 200 nations attending,</i>

283
00:44:03,513 --> 00:44:07,974
<i>the Secret Service has transformed
Ellis Island into a veritable Fort Knox</i>

284
00:44:08,101 --> 00:44:13,771
<i>for tomorrow night압 opening gala.
Ellis Island rests less than one mile from...</i>

285
00:44:15,567 --> 00:44:17,441
Rogue!

286
00:44:17,569 --> 00:44:19,645
Bobby!

287
00:44:19,779 --> 00:44:25,022
Rogue, what did you do? They say
you're stealing other mutants' powers.

288
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:27,199
No! I borrowed his power.

289
00:44:27,329 --> 00:44:31,113
You never use your power
against another mutant.

290
00:44:32,209 --> 00:44:34,248
I had no choice.

291
00:44:34,377 --> 00:44:39,752
- No, you have to understand...
- If I were you I'd get myself outta here.

292
00:44:41,551 --> 00:44:45,715
- What do you mean?
- Listen, the students are freaked.

293
00:44:45,847 --> 00:44:50,593
Professor Xavier's furious.
I don't know what he'll do with you.

294
00:44:52,812 --> 00:44:55,766
I think it'll be easier on your own.

295
00:45:01,905 --> 00:45:03,944
You should go.

296
00:45:26,304 --> 00:45:30,384
What are you looking for, Eric? It's strange.

297
00:45:30,517 --> 00:45:35,428
<i>There are more powerful mutants out there.
Why should this one be so important to him?</i>

298
00:45:35,563 --> 00:45:39,182
- Maybe it's his way with people.
- You don't like him.

299
00:45:39,317 --> 00:45:42,935
- How could you tell?
- Well, I am psychic, you know.

300
00:45:44,656 --> 00:45:46,280
- Where is she?
- Who?

301
00:45:46,408 --> 00:45:48,780
Rogue.

302
00:45:48,910 --> 00:45:50,369
She's gone.

303
00:45:54,874 --> 00:45:57,330
<i>Welcome, Professor.</i>

304
00:46:00,463 --> 00:46:02,503
Welcome to Cerebro.

305
00:46:08,263 --> 00:46:10,801
This certainly is a big, round room.

306
00:46:10,932 --> 00:46:14,301
The brain waves of mutants
are different from average humans.

307
00:46:14,436 --> 00:46:19,643
This device amplifies my power, allowing me
to locate mutants across great distances.

308
00:46:19,774 --> 00:46:24,401
- That's how I intend to find Rogue.
- Why don't you just use it to find Magneto?

309
00:46:24,529 --> 00:46:29,108
I've been trying, but he's found
some way to shield himself from it.

310
00:46:29,242 --> 00:46:32,362
How would he know how to do that?

311
00:46:32,495 --> 00:46:34,903
Because he helped me build it.

312
00:46:35,039 --> 00:46:37,281
Now if you'll excuse me...

313
00:46:50,555 --> 00:46:52,761
Have you ever?

314
00:46:52,891 --> 00:46:54,930
Used Cerebro?

315
00:46:55,059 --> 00:46:57,135
No.

316
00:46:57,270 --> 00:47:02,609
It takes a degree of control and...
for someone like me, it's...

317
00:47:02,734 --> 00:47:04,276
Dangerous.

318
00:47:42,815 --> 00:47:44,974
<i>...now boarding at track 4.</i>

319
00:47:48,821 --> 00:47:50,861
- She's at the station.
- Where is it?

320
00:47:50,990 --> 00:47:56,530
A few miles west of here. You can't leave the
mansion. It's the opportunity Magneto needs.

321
00:47:56,663 --> 00:48:00,363
- Listen, I'm the reason she took off.
- We had a deal.

322
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:03,287
She's all right. She's just upset.

323
00:48:03,419 --> 00:48:07,880
Storm, Cyclops, find her.
See if you can talk to her.

324
00:48:16,265 --> 00:48:19,266
- What?
- Where's my motorcycle?

325
00:48:56,389 --> 00:48:58,180
Hey, kid.

326
00:49:13,197 --> 00:49:15,653
I'm sorry about last night.

327
00:49:17,285 --> 00:49:19,324
Me, too.

328
00:49:20,163 --> 00:49:22,202
You running again?

329
00:49:23,749 --> 00:49:26,287
I heard the professor was mad at me.

330
00:49:26,419 --> 00:49:29,835
- Who told you that?
- A boy at school.

331
00:49:29,964 --> 00:49:35,255
- When's the last time you saw her?
- She was supposed to meet me for lunch.

332
00:49:39,098 --> 00:49:42,799
You look around,
I'll check with the ticket agent.

333
00:49:55,823 --> 00:49:58,279
<i>Welcome, Professor.</i>

334
00:50:22,433 --> 00:50:28,056
- You think I should go back.
- I think you should follow your instincts.

335
00:50:32,777 --> 00:50:38,317
The first boy I ever kissed
ended up in a coma for three weeks.

336
00:50:40,993 --> 00:50:43,663
I can still feel him inside my head.

337
00:50:45,122 --> 00:50:48,408
And it's the same with you.

338
00:51:15,403 --> 00:51:19,400
There's not many people
that'll understand what you're going through.

339
00:51:19,532 --> 00:51:22,698
But I think this guy Xavier's one of them.

340
00:51:24,245 --> 00:51:27,448
He seems to genuinely wanna help you.

341
00:51:27,581 --> 00:51:30,037
And that's a rare thing.

342
00:51:32,128 --> 00:51:34,583
For people like us.

343
00:51:43,889 --> 00:51:46,012
OK, so...

344
00:51:46,142 --> 00:51:50,435
What do you say?
Give these geeks one more shot?

345
00:51:52,398 --> 00:51:54,853
Come on, I'll take care of you.

346
00:51:56,861 --> 00:51:59,530
- You promise?
- Yeah.

347
00:52:00,614 --> 00:52:02,654
Yeah, I promise.

348
00:52:14,128 --> 00:52:16,666
Come along now. I told you not to...

349
00:52:18,299 --> 00:52:21,833
She's about 17, my height,

350
00:52:21,969 --> 00:52:25,303
has brown hair and she...

351
00:52:33,314 --> 00:52:36,149
Scream for me.

352
00:53:19,777 --> 00:53:22,612
Quit playing around.

353
00:54:04,113 --> 00:54:06,354
You must be Wolverine.

354
00:54:08,158 --> 00:54:13,283
That remarkable metal doesn't run through
your entire body, does it?

355
00:54:23,590 --> 00:54:25,334
Stop!

356
00:54:25,467 --> 00:54:27,294
Stop it!

357
00:54:28,053 --> 00:54:32,596
- What the hell do you want with me?
- You? My dear boy!

358
00:54:32,724 --> 00:54:35,394
<i>Whoever said I wanted you?</i>

359
00:54:56,748 --> 00:54:58,124
Young people!

360
00:55:09,845 --> 00:55:12,550
<i>All right, hold it! Hold it right there.</i>

361
00:55:12,681 --> 00:55:17,142
<i>Stay where you are.
Put your hands over your heads. Now!</i>

362
00:55:48,050 --> 00:55:51,216
You Homo sapiens and your guns.

363
00:55:55,015 --> 00:55:58,265
- That's enough, Eric.
- Let them go.

364
00:56:03,357 --> 00:56:06,808
Why not come out where I can see you,
Charles?

365
00:56:09,821 --> 00:56:12,110
What do you want her for?

366
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:15,158
Can't you read my mind?

367
00:56:17,037 --> 00:56:19,492
What now? Save the girl?

368
00:56:20,457 --> 00:56:24,502
You'll have to kill me, Charles.
And what will that accomplish?

369
00:56:24,628 --> 00:56:29,622
Let them pass that law and they'll have you
in chains with a number on your forehead.

370
00:56:29,758 --> 00:56:33,423
- It won't be that way.
- Then kill me and find out.

371
00:56:36,681 --> 00:56:39,173
No? Then release me.

372
00:56:47,859 --> 00:56:50,185
Fine!

373
00:57:02,749 --> 00:57:05,240
Care to press your luck, Charles?

374
00:57:09,297 --> 00:57:11,586
I don't think I can stop them all.

375
00:57:27,357 --> 00:57:32,482
Still unwilling to make sacrifices.
That's what makes you weak.

376
00:57:44,291 --> 00:57:46,829
Goodbye, Charles.

377
00:58:17,282 --> 00:58:20,236
<i>- You said he wanted me.
- I made a terrible mistake.</i>

378
00:58:20,368 --> 00:58:25,279
His helmet was somehow designed
to block my telepathy.

379
00:58:25,415 --> 00:58:28,831
Couldn't see what he was after
till it was too late.

380
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:31,036
- Where are you going?
- To find her.

381
00:58:31,171 --> 00:58:34,207
- How?
- The traditional way: Look.

382
00:58:38,136 --> 00:58:41,339
- Logan, you can't do this alone.
- Who'll help me? You?

383
00:58:41,473 --> 00:58:45,305
<i>- So far, you've all done a bang-up job.
- Then help us. Fight with us.</i>

384
00:58:45,435 --> 00:58:48,306
Fight with you? Join the team? Be an X-Man?

385
00:58:48,438 --> 00:58:51,190
Who the hell do you think you are?
You're a mutant.

386
00:58:51,316 --> 00:58:54,151
The world is full of people
that hate and fear you

387
00:58:54,277 --> 00:58:59,235
and you're wasting your time trying
to protect them. I got better things to do.

388
00:58:59,366 --> 00:59:02,900
You know, Magneto's right.
There's a war coming.

389
00:59:03,036 --> 00:59:06,950
- Are you sure you're on the right side?
- At least I've chosen a side.

390
00:59:14,714 --> 00:59:17,205
I'm looking for Dr Jean Grey.

391
00:59:27,227 --> 00:59:29,266
Senator Kelly.

392
00:59:30,146 --> 00:59:32,816
I'm Professor Charles Xavier.

393
00:59:33,650 --> 00:59:37,861
I was afraid if I went to hospital,
they would...

394
00:59:37,987 --> 00:59:40,027
Treat you like a mutant?

395
00:59:42,826 --> 00:59:46,029
We're not what you think. Not all of us.

396
00:59:46,621 --> 00:59:49,907
Tell it to the ones who did this to me.

397
00:59:54,295 --> 00:59:56,335
Senator...

398
01:00:01,052 --> 01:00:03,508
I want you to try and relax.

399
01:00:07,684 --> 01:00:10,139
I'm not going to hurt you.

400
01:01:01,654 --> 01:01:03,694
Welcome to the future.

401
01:01:05,074 --> 01:01:07,114
Brother.

402
01:01:12,874 --> 01:01:16,954
The machine emits radiation that triggers
mutation in ordinary human beings.

403
01:01:17,086 --> 01:01:21,131
But the mutation is unnatural.
Kelly's body is rejecting it.

404
01:01:21,257 --> 01:01:25,670
- His cells began to break down immediately.
- What effect does it have on mutants?

405
01:01:25,803 --> 01:01:31,177
There appears to be none. But I fear
it will harm any normal person exposed to it.

406
01:01:31,309 --> 01:01:35,141
- So what does Magneto want with Rogue?
- I don't know.

407
01:01:38,399 --> 01:01:43,145
Wait a second. You said this machine
draws its power from Magneto.

408
01:01:43,279 --> 01:01:48,866
- And that it weakened him.
- Yes. In fact, it nearly killed him.

409
01:01:49,786 --> 01:01:54,863
He's going to transfer his power to Rogue
and use her to power the machine.

410
01:01:58,002 --> 01:02:00,042
Is somebody there?

411
01:02:01,672 --> 01:02:04,424
Yes. I'm here.

412
01:02:06,469 --> 01:02:08,711
Please don't leave me!

413
01:02:11,557 --> 01:02:13,799
I don't want to be alone.

414
01:02:14,852 --> 01:02:16,892
All right.

415
01:02:26,155 --> 01:02:28,693
Do you hate normal people?

416
01:02:30,743 --> 01:02:32,783
Sometimes.

417
01:02:33,663 --> 01:02:35,702
Why?

418
01:02:39,460 --> 01:02:41,500
I suppose...

419
01:02:42,672 --> 01:02:45,127
I'm afraid of them.

420
01:02:47,218 --> 01:02:49,460
Well...

421
01:02:49,595 --> 01:02:55,384
I think you've got one less person...
to be afraid of.

422
01:03:18,165 --> 01:03:22,911
Cyclops, you and Storm ready the jet.
I'm gonna find Rogue. Get Logan a uniform.

423
01:03:23,045 --> 01:03:25,999
Wait a minute.
He's not coming with us, is he?

424
01:03:26,132 --> 01:03:29,750
- Yes.
- Sorry, but he'll endanger the mission and...

425
01:03:29,885 --> 01:03:32,922
I wasn't the one who gave the station
a new sunroof, pal.

426
01:03:33,055 --> 01:03:35,890
No, you were the one
who stabbed Rogue in the chest.

427
01:03:36,017 --> 01:03:39,136
Why don't you take your little mission
and stick it up...

428
01:03:39,270 --> 01:03:41,725
Senator Kelly is dead.

429
01:03:43,524 --> 01:03:45,600
I'm going to find her.

430
01:03:48,571 --> 01:03:49,567
Settle this.

431
01:04:27,318 --> 01:04:29,357
I'm sorry.

432
01:04:52,885 --> 01:04:56,634
You can still hear me... can't you?

433
01:05:05,064 --> 01:05:09,358
You've taught me everything in my life
that was ever worth knowing.

434
01:05:09,485 --> 01:05:11,940
And if anything happens...

435
01:05:14,573 --> 01:05:16,233
I'll take care of them.

436
01:05:30,256 --> 01:05:31,666
Jean?

437
01:05:35,177 --> 01:05:37,419
Jean!

438
01:05:37,555 --> 01:05:39,843
No!

439
01:05:52,611 --> 01:05:54,403
Jean?

440
01:05:54,530 --> 01:05:56,569
Jean.

441
01:05:56,699 --> 01:05:58,738
Answer me. Please.

442
01:06:00,119 --> 01:06:02,277
I know where Magneto's going.

443
01:07:22,159 --> 01:07:24,235
Magnificent, isn't she?

444
01:07:25,412 --> 01:07:29,280
- I've seen it.
- I first saw her in 1949.

445
01:07:30,584 --> 01:07:35,791
America was going to be
the land of tolerance. Of peace.

446
01:07:40,844 --> 01:07:43,300
Are you going to kill me?

447
01:07:47,851 --> 01:07:49,643
Yes.

448
01:07:49,770 --> 01:07:53,720
- Why?
- Because there is no land of tolerance.

449
01:07:53,857 --> 01:07:57,772
There is no peace, not here or anywhere else.

450
01:07:59,154 --> 01:08:04,528
Whole families destroyed simply because
they were born different from those in power.

451
01:08:04,660 --> 01:08:09,785
Well, after tonight,
the world's powerful will be just like us.

452
01:08:09,915 --> 01:08:12,620
They will return home as brothers.

453
01:08:13,126 --> 01:08:15,166
As mutants.

454
01:08:15,295 --> 01:08:17,751
Our cause will be theirs.

455
01:08:18,799 --> 01:08:21,965
Your sacrifice will mean our survival.

456
01:08:25,722 --> 01:08:29,802
I'll understand
if that comes as small consolation.

457
01:08:32,729 --> 01:08:34,769
Put her in the machine.

458
01:08:36,525 --> 01:08:38,564
I'll raise it.

459
01:08:39,778 --> 01:08:42,351
Magneto is here - Liberty Island.

460
01:08:42,489 --> 01:08:48,409
Presumably his objective is to mutate the
world leaders at the summit on Ellis Island.

461
01:08:48,537 --> 01:08:52,748
He doesn't know his machine kills,
and judging from what the professor saw

462
01:08:52,874 --> 01:08:58,628
if Magneto gave Rogue enough power,
he could wipe out everyone in New York City.

463
01:08:58,755 --> 01:09:02,420
All right. We can insert here
at the George Washington Bridge.

464
01:09:02,551 --> 01:09:07,676
Come around the bank, just off of Manhattan,
land on the far side of Liberty Island. Here.

465
01:09:07,806 --> 01:09:09,964
What about harbour patrol? Radar?

466
01:09:10,100 --> 01:09:13,967
If they have anything that can pick up ourjet,
they deserve to catch us.

467
01:09:28,493 --> 01:09:31,447
You actually go outside in these things?

468
01:09:31,580 --> 01:09:35,245
What would you prefer? Yellow spandex?

469
01:09:42,257 --> 01:09:43,253
Whoa.

470
01:10:24,966 --> 01:10:27,967
There's the bridge. I'm takin' her down.

471
01:10:34,893 --> 01:10:36,932
Storm, some cover, please.

472
01:10:55,622 --> 01:10:59,620
Toad, Mystique, stay sharp. We're not alone.

473
01:10:59,751 --> 01:11:04,958
And you stay here. Once I've given my power
to the girl, I'll be temporarily weakened.

474
01:11:05,090 --> 01:11:07,545
You'll be my only defence.

475
01:11:14,849 --> 01:11:16,676
Sounds like a storm's comin'.

476
01:11:31,741 --> 01:11:34,576
- Sorry.
- You call that a landing?

477
01:11:47,257 --> 01:11:49,629
The torch.

478
01:11:56,307 --> 01:12:01,515
<i>...the proceedings. The first dignitaries
started to arrive about an hour ago,</i>

479
01:12:01,646 --> 01:12:05,596
<i>greeted with a garden-party atmosphere
designed to entertain them</i>

480
01:12:05,734 --> 01:12:08,225
<i>as the others traversed the rigid security.</i>

481
01:12:33,845 --> 01:12:36,514
- There's someone here.
- Where?

482
01:12:37,474 --> 01:12:40,474
- I don't know. Keep your eye open.
- Logan...

483
01:12:44,022 --> 01:12:46,014
Damn it!

484
01:12:51,988 --> 01:12:56,152
- Anything?
- There's someone here. I just can't see 'em.

485
01:13:09,005 --> 01:13:10,380
Wait!

486
01:13:17,430 --> 01:13:19,636
Back up! Back up!

487
01:14:36,426 --> 01:14:37,920
Jean!

488
01:14:39,429 --> 01:14:40,709
Oh, God!

489
01:15:40,615 --> 01:15:42,821
Don't move.

490
01:15:59,467 --> 01:16:02,172
Don't you people ever die?

491
01:16:35,127 --> 01:16:39,789
Do you know what happens to a toad
when it's struck by lightning?

492
01:16:45,388 --> 01:16:48,804
The same thing
that happens to everything else.

493
01:17:03,322 --> 01:17:05,778
Logan, is that you?

494
01:17:17,128 --> 01:17:20,164
The other one ain't far away.

495
01:17:20,297 --> 01:17:24,675
- Come on. We have to regroup.
- I know, but there's a problem.

496
01:17:27,930 --> 01:17:30,421
You're not part of the group.

497
01:17:51,162 --> 01:17:53,653
Hey, hey! It's me.

498
01:17:53,789 --> 01:17:56,245
- Prove it.
- You're a dick.

499
01:17:57,501 --> 01:17:59,375
OK.

500
01:18:00,713 --> 01:18:02,124
Hey!

501
01:18:21,484 --> 01:18:24,603
- Everybody get out of here.
- What is it?

502
01:18:24,737 --> 01:18:26,776
I can't move.

503
01:18:46,508 --> 01:18:48,750
Ah, my brothers.

504
01:18:49,511 --> 01:18:55,466
Welcome. And you, just point those claws
of yours in a safer direction.

505
01:19:09,323 --> 01:19:11,565
You better close your eyes.

506
01:19:14,703 --> 01:19:16,577
Storm, fry 'em.

507
01:19:16,705 --> 01:19:24,001
A bolt of lightning into a huge copper
conductor. I thought you lived at a school.

508
01:19:29,259 --> 01:19:33,340
For those of you not familiar
with the historical significance...

509
01:19:37,935 --> 01:19:39,974
Mystique?

510
01:19:40,771 --> 01:19:44,603
- Mystique!
- I've seen Senator Kelly.

511
01:19:45,234 --> 01:19:50,821
So, the good senator survived his fall.
And the swim to shore.

512
01:19:50,948 --> 01:19:53,521
He's become even more powerful
than I imagined.

513
01:19:53,659 --> 01:19:56,280
- He's dead.
- It's true.

514
01:19:56,412 --> 01:20:00,540
I saw him die.
Like those people down there will die.

515
01:20:01,333 --> 01:20:04,204
Are you sure you saw what you saw?

516
01:20:04,336 --> 01:20:08,630
I would also like to thank the
President of the United States of America

517
01:20:08,757 --> 01:20:14,463
for hosting this event under the lights
of the great city of New York.

518
01:20:21,854 --> 01:20:25,803
Why do none of you understand
what I'm trying to do?

519
01:20:25,941 --> 01:20:31,446
Those people down there control our fate
and the fate of every other mutant!

520
01:20:32,865 --> 01:20:35,071
Well...

521
01:20:35,200 --> 01:20:37,774
soon our fate will be theirs.

522
01:20:37,911 --> 01:20:41,161
<i>Help! Please help me!</i>

523
01:20:41,957 --> 01:20:47,461
<i>You're so full of shit. If you're really
so righteous, it'd be you in that thing.</i>

524
01:20:49,548 --> 01:20:53,131
Help! Somebody help me!

525
01:21:06,023 --> 01:21:08,062
<i>Please!</i>

526
01:21:09,735 --> 01:21:11,727
<i>Somebody please help me!</i>

527
01:21:17,326 --> 01:21:20,742
Somebody! Help me...

528
01:21:31,965 --> 01:21:34,291
Logan!

529
01:22:29,690 --> 01:22:33,059
- I'm sorry, my dear.
- Don't do this.

530
01:22:45,497 --> 01:22:47,537
This is mine.

531
01:23:50,478 --> 01:23:52,601
You owe me a scream.

532
01:23:56,193 --> 01:23:59,941
Hey, bub, I'm not finished with you yet.

533
01:24:03,617 --> 01:24:06,321
- Jean.
- Scott, when I tell you, open your eyes.

534
01:24:06,453 --> 01:24:07,449
- No!
- Trust me.

535
01:24:07,579 --> 01:24:10,152
You drop something?

536
01:24:14,085 --> 01:24:16,125
Now!

537
01:24:30,268 --> 01:24:32,344
- Thanks.
- Don't mention it.

538
01:24:33,063 --> 01:24:37,559
- Gotta get her outta there. Can you hit it?
- The rings are moving too fast.

539
01:24:37,692 --> 01:24:40,479
- Shoot it!
- I'll kill her! Storm, can you get me up?

540
01:24:40,612 --> 01:24:43,862
- I can't control it like that.
- Then let me go.

541
01:24:45,533 --> 01:24:50,610
If I don't make it,
at least you can still blast the damn thing.

542
01:24:51,456 --> 01:24:55,501
All right, do it!
Jean, use your power. Try to steady him.

543
01:24:57,128 --> 01:24:59,168
Hang on to something.

544
01:25:53,685 --> 01:25:56,354
Scott, wait!

545
01:26:25,675 --> 01:26:28,047
- Jean, I have to!
- Just wait!

546
01:26:29,929 --> 01:26:32,467
I have a shot.

547
01:26:32,599 --> 01:26:34,472
I'm taking it.

548
01:27:14,724 --> 01:27:17,180
Come on...

549
01:28:47,525 --> 01:28:51,225
Hey, this one's alive. Let's get him outta here.

550
01:29:17,179 --> 01:29:21,224
Welcome back. I knew you'd find your way.

551
01:29:21,350 --> 01:29:23,390
I had you to guide me.

552
01:29:26,522 --> 01:29:28,978
How did we do?

553
01:29:56,469 --> 01:29:59,173
Oh, that tickles.

554
01:29:59,305 --> 01:30:01,344
Hey.

555
01:30:02,600 --> 01:30:04,260
Hey.

556
01:30:04,393 --> 01:30:06,433
How are you feeling?

557
01:30:06,562 --> 01:30:08,602
Fantastic.

558
01:30:09,857 --> 01:30:12,430
That was a brave thing you did.

559
01:30:13,778 --> 01:30:16,447
- Did it work?
- Yeah.

560
01:30:16,572 --> 01:30:23,405
She's fine. She took on a few of your
more charming personality traits for a while.

561
01:30:24,330 --> 01:30:26,785
But we lived through it.

562
01:30:29,377 --> 01:30:31,998
I think she's a little taken with you.

563
01:30:32,129 --> 01:30:36,625
Well, you can tell her
my heart belongs to someone else.

564
01:30:41,430 --> 01:30:43,672
You know, you and I...

565
01:30:43,808 --> 01:30:45,847
How's the professor?

566
01:30:47,770 --> 01:30:50,012
He's good.

567
01:30:50,147 --> 01:30:52,187
Good.

568
01:30:56,862 --> 01:31:01,240
There's an abandoned military compound
at Alkali Lake in the Canadian Rockies

569
01:31:01,367 --> 01:31:05,495
close to where we found you.
There's not much left but...

570
01:31:05,621 --> 01:31:08,077
you might find some answers.

571
01:31:10,251 --> 01:31:14,248
- Thank you.
- Are you going to say goodbye to them?

572
01:31:16,799 --> 01:31:19,966
<i>The Mutant Registration Act
lost its main proponent</i>

573
01:31:20,094 --> 01:31:22,881
<i>with the reversal of Senator Robert Kelly</i>

574
01:31:23,013 --> 01:31:27,474
<i>who until now had provided the loudest
voice in the cry for mutant registration.</i>

575
01:31:27,601 --> 01:31:33,521
<i>I was wrong in this particular issue and I
hope, in time, I may be forgiven. Thank you.</i>

576
01:31:33,649 --> 01:31:36,685
<i>The Mutant Registration Act
continues to draw support...</i>

577
01:31:36,819 --> 01:31:38,858
Mystique.

578
01:31:39,947 --> 01:31:41,986
Son of a bitch.

579
01:31:44,076 --> 01:31:49,581
<i>... from many parentsrights groups
who feel threatened by unidentified mutants.</i>

580
01:31:49,707 --> 01:31:56,243
<i>In a related story, the body of Senator Kelly압
aide, Henry Guyrich, was found today.</i>

581
01:31:56,380 --> 01:32:01,754
<i>Preliminary coroner압 reports seem to
indicate that Guyrich was mauled by a bear.</i>

582
01:32:02,219 --> 01:32:04,259
Hey!

583
01:32:08,434 --> 01:32:11,518
- You running again?
- Not really.

584
01:32:13,022 --> 01:32:16,307
I have some things to take care of up north.

585
01:32:21,697 --> 01:32:23,939
I kinda like it.

586
01:32:27,953 --> 01:32:30,409
I don't want you to go.

587
01:32:43,719 --> 01:32:46,175
I'll be back for this.

588
01:33:24,259 --> 01:33:26,632
Doesn't it ever wake you in the night,

589
01:33:26,762 --> 01:33:31,756
the feeling that someday they will pass
that foolish law, or one just like it,

590
01:33:31,892 --> 01:33:34,015
and come for you?

591
01:33:34,144 --> 01:33:36,386
And your children?

592
01:33:39,775 --> 01:33:42,230
It does indeed.

593
01:33:46,824 --> 01:33:49,778
What do you do when you wake up to that?

594
01:33:49,910 --> 01:33:56,791
I feel a swell of pity for the poor soul who
comes to that school looking for trouble.

595
01:34:05,425 --> 01:34:07,465
Why do you come here, Charles?

596
01:34:07,594 --> 01:34:11,094
Why do you ask questions
to which you already know the answers?

597
01:34:11,223 --> 01:34:15,552
Oh, yes. Your continuing search for hope.

598
01:34:26,196 --> 01:34:30,028
You know this plastic prison of theirs
won't hold me for ever.

599
01:34:30,158 --> 01:34:34,785
The war is still coming, Charles,
and I intend to fight it.

600
01:34:35,789 --> 01:34:38,458
By any means necessary.

601
01:34:39,293 --> 01:34:41,748
And I will always be there.

602
01:34:43,380 --> 01:34:45,836
Old friend.

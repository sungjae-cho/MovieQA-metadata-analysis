1
00:00:41,925 --> 00:00:44,257
My name is Dalton Russell.

2
00:00:45,061 --> 00:00:46,995
Pay strict attention to what I say

3
00:00:47,063 --> 00:00:50,931
because I choose my words carefully
and I never repeat myself.

4
00:00:51,101 --> 00:00:54,002
I've told you my name. That's the "who."

5
00:00:55,472 --> 00:00:59,272
The "where" could most readily
be described as a prison cell.

6
00:00:59,776 --> 00:01:01,073
DALTON: But there's a vast difference

7
00:01:01,144 --> 00:01:04,841
between being stuck in a tiny cell
and being in prison.

8
00:01:06,249 --> 00:01:07,978
The "what" is easy.

9
00:01:08,651 --> 00:01:13,486
Recently I planned and set in motion
events to execute the perfect bank robbery.

10
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:16,158
That's also the "when."

11
00:01:16,726 --> 00:01:20,924
As for the "why,"
beyond the obvious financial motivation,

12
00:01:21,498 --> 00:01:23,466
it's exceedingly simple.

13
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:26,025
Because I can.

14
00:01:27,203 --> 00:01:29,763
Which leaves us only with the "how."

15
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:33,041
And therein, as the Bard would tell us,

16
00:01:34,344 --> 00:01:35,811
lies the rub.

17
00:04:53,209 --> 00:04:54,972
So, your mother tells me about

18
00:04:56,779 --> 00:05:00,237
a certain young lady who's helping you
with the Triborough Bridge project?

19
00:05:01,317 --> 00:05:03,046
- Okay?
- All right, okay.

20
00:05:04,053 --> 00:05:05,179
He's crazy.

21
00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:12,359
- Now? On 51st? 50...
- CHAIM: Yeah, that's where he is right now.

22
00:05:12,428 --> 00:05:16,489
He's on 40, he... No, he's still on 47th Street,
but it's a much smaller space.

23
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:18,329
HAMMOND: What do I have to...

24
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:23,561
Yeah, we'll get lobster.
I'll put it on Mr. Ansinori's card.

25
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:27,632
Whatever. It's a meeting
with one of his clients or something.

26
00:05:29,345 --> 00:05:32,473
Because it's been like over a year now.
Yeah.

27
00:05:35,451 --> 00:05:37,783
I want to snap this guy's neck,
I swear to God.

28
00:05:40,957 --> 00:05:42,219
NANCY: So what?

29
00:05:43,526 --> 00:05:47,053
So what? They're flowers.
They could've been to his grandmother.

30
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:49,928
They could've been to me.
It's my birthday, so...

31
00:05:52,402 --> 00:05:54,393
Okay, so maybe it's a client's.

32
00:05:55,872 --> 00:05:56,930
(NANCY CHUCKLES)

33
00:05:57,173 --> 00:05:59,232
Okay. This is funny.

34
00:05:59,575 --> 00:06:03,341
I got this guy in front of me
that thinks I don't see him looking at me.

35
00:06:03,413 --> 00:06:06,644
Fantastic. God damn it.

36
00:06:06,716 --> 00:06:08,343
- Excuse me.
- Yeah.

37
00:06:08,851 --> 00:06:10,978
Can you lower your voice
just a little bit, please?

38
00:06:11,053 --> 00:06:13,920
You're getting a little loud on your phone.
Please.

39
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:15,318
Yeah. Fine.

40
00:06:15,391 --> 00:06:17,188
I don't want you
disturbing the other customers.

41
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:18,522
- Sorry.
- All right?

42
00:06:18,594 --> 00:06:20,494
- Yeah, you got it.
- Thank you.

43
00:06:22,331 --> 00:06:24,231
It was a security guy.

44
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:27,497
I didn't know I was in a library.
It's a fucking bank.

45
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:29,197
Manhattan Trust.

46
00:06:32,575 --> 00:06:36,170
...from Yale.
And this fucking rich prick I work for.

47
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:41,814
Thank you.

48
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:55,795
Excuse me. Sir?

49
00:06:56,098 --> 00:06:57,190
DALTON: Easy.

50
00:06:57,667 --> 00:07:00,761
Everybody get down on the fucking floor!
Now!

51
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:02,327
(ALL SCREAMING)

00:07:02,972 --> 00:07:04,405
STEVE-O: Get down on the ground!

53
00:07:04,474 --> 00:07:08,308
DALTON: You have four seconds!
Anyone still standing gets shot!

54
00:07:08,544 --> 00:07:11,809
One! Two! Three!

55
00:07:11,881 --> 00:07:15,112
STEVE-O: Back away from that counter!
Get your hand away from that button!

56
00:07:16,552 --> 00:07:18,713
Put your hands on the floor! Now!

57
00:07:18,788 --> 00:07:20,653
Oh... What the... What is this?

58
00:07:20,723 --> 00:07:23,055
- Todd, what are we gonna do?
- What the fuck do you want me to do?

59
00:07:23,125 --> 00:07:25,218
- STEVE-O: Keep your head down, fat man!
- All right!

60
00:07:25,328 --> 00:07:27,796
DALTON: Get your fucking face on the floor!

61
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:32,890
You get the same treatment
as everyone else, Rabbi.

62
00:07:33,803 --> 00:07:34,963
Get down.

63
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:37,096
(CHAIM GRUNTS)

64
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:42,344
Now, my friends and I are making

65
00:07:42,411 --> 00:07:45,141
a very large withdrawal from this bank.

66
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:49,814
Anybody gets in our way
gets a bullet in the brain.

67
00:07:51,921 --> 00:07:54,389
Lie down, old man!
Put your fucking hands down!

68
00:07:54,457 --> 00:07:57,255
- DALTON: Get your face on the floor.
- MAN: All right, I'm down! I'm down!

Hey, Officer,
there's smoke coming out of there.

Possible 10-30. Manhattan Trust.

71
00:08:20,316 --> 00:08:22,113
I have got hostages.

72
00:08:22,552 --> 00:08:26,147
You fucking cops come near this door,
I start killing people.

73
00:08:26,489 --> 00:08:28,389
I not fucking kidding, man.

74
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:36,391
Central. Give me an 85.

75
00:08:36,465 --> 00:08:38,228
Back up, sir! Back up! You!

76
00:08:38,301 --> 00:08:39,666

- Back up! Back up!

Central, give me an 85.

Perp with a gun. Possible hostages.

I repeat, possible hostages.
20 Exchange. Manhattan Trust.

81
00:08:49,145 --> 00:08:50,806
Baby, I'm fighting for my life over here.

82
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,872
Keith, every time we have this conversation,
it's the same thing.

83
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:55,212
- "Not now."
- Listen. Listen.

84
00:08:55,284 --> 00:08:57,445
Do you know what kind of thin ice
I'm on right now

85
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,579
with this check-cashing thing?
They want to lock me up.

86
00:08:59,655 --> 00:09:01,850
If this $140,000 doesn't show up
somewhere soon,

87
00:09:01,924 --> 00:09:04,222
- things gonna get rough for me.
- But you didn't take it.

88
00:09:04,293 --> 00:09:07,023
Of course I didn't take it, baby.
It's just some lying drug dealer

89
00:09:07,096 --> 00:09:09,030
trying to save his own ass
by fucking me over.

90
00:09:09,098 --> 00:09:10,895
- Eventually, it'll go away.
- Then what?

91
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:13,197
- What about us?
- Then, you know, I'll make First Grade

92
00:09:13,269 --> 00:09:16,136
and we'll have enough money
to buy a bigger place and then, you know...

93
00:09:16,205 --> 00:09:19,003
Why we got to have this conversation
every time your brother gets locked up

94
00:09:19,075 --> 00:09:22,010
- or gets caught stealing a car?
- He's the only family I've got.

95
00:09:22,078 --> 00:09:24,012
All right, I'm sorry, baby. You okay?

96
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,741
- You still love me?
- I'm sorry, too.

97
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:27,373
- You still love me?
- I love you, baby.

All right. Big Willie and the twins for you
when I get home.

- I got the handcuffs.
- I got the gun.

Bye, Big Daddy.

101
00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:36,952
- Big Willie and the twins, huh?
- That's correct.

102
00:09:37,026 --> 00:09:40,894
Her lowlife brother, he's got three priors,
one for armed robbery.

103
00:09:40,963 --> 00:09:44,262
17-year-old high-school dropout.
Doesn't have an honest bone in his body

104
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:47,632
and he's too fucking stupid
to amount to anything. Even as a criminal.

105
00:09:47,703 --> 00:09:50,035
- Can't you get rid of him?
- I could, couldn't I?

106
00:09:50,106 --> 00:09:52,597
No, she loves him. What am I gonna do?
Put him out in the street?

107
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:54,267
- How's he feel about you?
- Oh, he's thrilled.

108
00:09:54,343 --> 00:09:56,038
To have a detective
sleeping in the next room,

109
00:09:56,112 --> 00:09:58,342
banging his sister.
Then she tries to bring it all back on me.

110
00:09:58,414 --> 00:10:01,042
You know, "If we had a bigger place,
we wouldn't have this problem."

111
00:10:01,117 --> 00:10:03,677
Of course, if we got married
then things would be different.

112
00:10:03,753 --> 00:10:06,722
- And what's wrong with that?
- A wedding. Furniture. Kids.

113
00:10:06,789 --> 00:10:08,256
You know what a diamond ring costs?

114
00:10:08,324 --> 00:10:10,758
- Come on, man. You've been married.
- Please. I was 21.

115
00:10:10,826 --> 00:10:14,023
- Yeah, but you give her a ring?
- Yeah, but she won't call me back.

116
00:10:14,397 --> 00:10:17,423
- You guys cops?
- Oh, shit! He made us!

- What?
- Grossman's on vacation. You're up.

What about the Madrugada thing?
The check-cashing thing?

121
00:10:28,144 --> 00:10:30,544
- I thought I was in the doghouse.
- I just threw you a bone.

122
00:10:30,613 --> 00:10:32,342
As far as I'm concerned, you still work here,

123
00:10:32,415 --> 00:10:34,610
- but if you don't think you're ready...
- No, no, he's ready!

124
00:10:34,684 --> 00:10:36,345
Oh, good. Good.

125
00:10:36,419 --> 00:10:38,944
I'm giving you a break, here.
Don't make me look like a fool.

126
00:10:39,021 --> 00:10:41,615
- This is it, baby. The show!
- Yeah.

127
00:10:41,691 --> 00:10:43,318
You got the call, man. God damn!

128
00:10:43,392 --> 00:10:45,917
I guess I should be happy.
I might get to put off I.A.B.

129
00:10:45,995 --> 00:10:47,986
Here's all you need to know.
You walk in unarmed.

130
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:50,794
Head bad guy puts a gun to your head
and makes you get on your knees.

131
00:10:50,866 --> 00:10:53,596
You look around. There are five armed men
pointing Uzis at you.

132
00:10:53,669 --> 00:10:55,227
Just picture them in their underwear.

133
00:10:55,304 --> 00:10:56,896
How about orange jumpsuits and shackles?

134
00:10:56,972 --> 00:11:00,499
- There you go, Keith. You can do this, man.
- Look out, bad guys. Here I come.

135

Get back!

I told you, move it! Move it!

137
00:11:30,706 --> 00:11:33,470
Get those people back!
Get them the hell out of here!

138
00:11:35,144 --> 00:11:38,238
All right, guys, as soon as we pull up,
I want everybody out.

140
00:11:40,816 --> 00:11:42,784
The second floor window. Now.

141
00:11:43,252 --> 00:11:46,085
- Let them in there!
- Let's go! Go now!

142
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:49,322
Sarge, what do you got?

143
00:11:49,391 --> 00:11:52,121
I got a perp in the bank.
Possible hostage situation.

144
00:11:52,194 --> 00:11:53,456
Who's on today? Who's your boss?

145
00:11:53,529 --> 00:11:55,690
- Sergeant Hernandez. I'll get him over here.
- Get him down here.

146
00:11:55,765 --> 00:11:58,199
- Sergeant Hernandez, you on the air?
- On the air. Go.

147
00:11:58,267 --> 00:12:01,031
Sarge, I got Sergeant Collins over here.
He called this in.

148
00:12:01,103 --> 00:12:02,570
Can you come over to the other side?

149
00:12:02,638 --> 00:12:04,868
Redirect, on my way. Let's go.

150
00:12:16,752 --> 00:12:19,186

around the corner.

151

COP 2: We got to keep this secure.

152

- Collins? What you got?
- Hernandez.

153
00:12:23,859 --> 00:12:27,522
I got a perp inside with a gun.
He claims he's got some hostages in there.

154
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:31,599
Everyone, heads up! Let's clear the way!

155
00:12:51,554 --> 00:12:53,920
Let's go. Set them up. All right.

156
00:12:54,557 --> 00:12:56,616
We've got it under control.

157
00:12:57,293 --> 00:12:58,783
Step back, please!

158
00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:01,125
- Step back!
- Get back! Thank you.

159
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:03,097
There's nothing going on.

160
00:13:03,332 --> 00:13:05,197
You'll see it on the news tonight.

161
00:13:05,267 --> 00:13:06,928
Step back, please.

162
00:13:18,914 --> 00:13:20,176
Mr. Case?

163
00:13:20,249 --> 00:13:22,911
Oh, good morning, Katherine.
What can I do for you?

164
00:13:22,985 --> 00:13:26,216
Sir, there's a robbery in progress
at one of our branches.

165
00:13:26,288 --> 00:13:27,516
Oh, my.

166
00:13:27,957 --> 00:13:31,984
- Has anybody been hurt?
- I don't think so, but there are hostages.

167
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:34,419
Oh, how awful.

168
00:13:35,731 --> 00:13:39,223
- Which branch is it?
- Number 32. 20 Exchange Place.

169
00:13:39,869 --> 00:13:42,337
- Which one?
- 20 Exchange Place.

170
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:46,732
Thank you, Katherine.

171
00:13:46,809 --> 00:13:48,572
I'm sorry, Mr. Case.

172
00:14:00,456 --> 00:14:01,923
Oh, dear God.

173
00:14:04,426 --> 00:14:07,054
Get these people out of here.
Come on, open these gates. Back up.

174
00:14:07,129 --> 00:14:09,427
Up on the sidewalk. Come on in.

175
00:14:14,737 --> 00:14:17,570
Sergeant Collins, first on scene.
Are you the hostage negotiator?

176
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:20,336
That's right. Detective Frazier.
This is Detective Mitchell. What do you got?

177
00:14:20,409 --> 00:14:22,343
Not much.
Saw the bank was filled with smoke.

178
00:14:22,411 --> 00:14:24,743
The door was locked.
I tried to take a look inside

179
00:14:24,813 --> 00:14:28,214
and one of the gunmen opens the door,
sticks a.357 in my face,

180
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:30,878
screaming in some foreign accent
about killing hostages.

181
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:33,683
- See any other gunmen?
- No, sir. I couldn't see anything at all.

182
00:14:33,756 --> 00:14:35,417
- You hear anything inside?
- No, sir,

183
00:14:35,491 --> 00:14:39,484
but with that.357 sticking in my face,
I can't really be sure. I'm sorry.

184
00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:41,020
Okay.

185
00:14:42,531 --> 00:14:45,796
Good, good. Good, good, good, good.
You did a good job, Sergeant.

186
00:14:45,868 --> 00:14:48,234
You ever had a gun
stuck in your face before?

187
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:49,362
- Yeah, once.
- Really?

188
00:14:49,438 --> 00:14:51,201
Yeah, by a 12-year-old.

189
00:14:51,273 --> 00:14:54,709
- What was that like?
- Not one of my better days.

190
00:14:54,777 --> 00:14:56,904
I bet. All right, well, look.

191
00:14:56,979 --> 00:14:59,641
As soon as we get this thing cleared up,
we'll cut you loose, all right?

192
00:14:59,715 --> 00:15:01,649
If you don't mind,
I'd rather hang around a while,

193
00:15:01,717 --> 00:15:03,480
at least until we make contact.

194
00:15:03,552 --> 00:15:05,816
That's what I like to hear, Sergeant.

195
00:15:24,039 --> 00:15:27,338
What? Come on. Why you doing this?
Why you doing this to me?

196
00:15:28,777 --> 00:15:31,439

- Peter what?
- Peter Hammond.

203
00:16:23,465 --> 00:16:26,764
- Where's your cell phone, Peter Hammond?
- I left it at home.

204

Hey.

You may remember,
we worked that hospital thing on 93rd,

258

during my training?

259
00:21:01,143 --> 00:21:03,611

Yeah, it was. It was.

261

So, what do we got?

262
00:21:07,282 --> 00:21:10,979
I got an unknown number of suspects
and an unknown number of hostages,

263
00:21:11,053 --> 00:21:14,580
and a bank, and about a million spectators,
and I can't see shit inside there,

264
00:21:14,656 --> 00:21:16,385
- so I'm kind of busy.
- I understand.

265
00:21:16,458 --> 00:21:19,154
The way this works, Mr. Frazier,
is I deal with Mr. Grossman.

266
00:21:19,227 --> 00:21:21,525
So if you need anything,
you can speak with him, okay?

267
00:21:21,596 --> 00:21:23,587
No, it's not okay, Captain.

268
00:21:23,665 --> 00:21:26,190
Detective Grossman is away on vacation,

269
00:21:26,268 --> 00:21:29,135
so Detective Frazier
is the big dick today, all right?

270
00:21:29,204 --> 00:21:32,833
Now, if you need anything,
you can speak to me, all right?

271
00:21:32,908 --> 00:21:34,273
I guess it'll have to be.

272
00:21:34,343 --> 00:21:36,641
That's the way it's gonna be.
You got vests for us?

273
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:38,009
- Berk!
- BERK: Yo!

274
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,014
- Get these guys some vests!
- Okay.

275
00:21:40,082 --> 00:21:41,947
- And check them into the command log.
- Okay.

276
00:21:42,017 --> 00:21:43,712
You know what?
I'm gonna get out of your hair

277
00:21:43,785 --> 00:21:45,685
and let you get control
of this crime scene, okay?

278
00:21:45,754 --> 00:21:48,018
You'll let me know when you're ready
with a detailed briefing?

279
00:21:48,090 --> 00:21:50,991
- Okay.
- We're gonna take a walk down to the diner.

280
00:21:51,293 --> 00:21:54,057
Don't go in the bank without calling us first,
all right? Okay?

281
00:21:54,129 --> 00:21:56,723
- All right.
- Good to see you, Captain.

282
00:22:05,107 --> 00:22:06,836
Shouldn't we be in there?

283
00:22:07,509 --> 00:22:10,410
Let's give him some time. See what he does.
Come on.

284
00:22:11,513 --> 00:22:14,004
Until he secures his position
and gets the physical layout,

285
00:22:14,082 --> 00:22:15,310
he'll only dump on us.

286
00:22:15,384 --> 00:22:17,784
If the show starts, he'll call us.
Trust me. I've seen him work.

287
00:22:17,853 --> 00:22:18,979
Your call, Keith.

288
00:22:19,054 --> 00:22:21,352
Can you get that for me?
I guess it is, isn't it?

289
00:22:21,423 --> 00:22:23,254
That's the one thing I learned
from Grossman,

290
00:22:23,325 --> 00:22:25,589
is these guys don't have much respect
for what we do.

291
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:28,060
- How do you mean?
- Well, to them it's a tactical situation.

292
00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:32,260
Us being here means there's
a mental side to it that they don't get.

293
00:22:32,334 --> 00:22:34,632
- Told you, you could handle this.
- Yeah.

294
00:22:34,703 --> 00:22:38,104
I keep waiting for someone higher up
on the food chain to show up and say,

295
00:22:38,173 --> 00:22:39,299
"Here's what we do."

296
00:22:39,374 --> 00:22:40,739
What happened at the hospital?

297
00:22:40,809 --> 00:22:43,573

I might not see my family again? Yeah.

319
00:24:06,094 --> 00:24:08,756
Yeah, I thought about it.
I mean, at first, I wasn't...

320
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:11,264
It was too much to think about at that point.

but after a while I...

322

00:25:51,566 --> 00:25:54,399
my only intention is to spend time
in your wonderful city

333
00:25:54,469 --> 00:25:56,266
and to enjoy all that it has to offer.

334
00:25:56,338 --> 00:25:57,737
And no business with your uncle?

335
00:25:57,806 --> 00:26:00,104
In truth, I have very little
to do with him these days.

336
00:26:00,175 --> 00:26:02,666
I'm told you haven't seen him in nine years.
Is that right?

337
00:26:02,744 --> 00:26:06,271
- You are extremely well informed.
- I have to be. Yes?

338
00:26:06,348 --> 00:26:09,340
I have a Mr. Arthur Case
on the phone for you.

339
00:26:11,086 --> 00:26:12,314
We'll need to end this here.

340
00:26:12,387 --> 00:26:14,412
I'm gonna need
a copy of your purchase agreement,

341
00:26:14,489 --> 00:26:16,582
your mortgage application,
and the other documentation,

342
00:26:16,658 --> 00:26:18,853
- and I'll be in touch.
- Thank you, Miss White.

343
00:26:18,927 --> 00:26:20,690
Right this way, sir.

344
00:26:31,706 --> 00:26:33,571
Arthur Case? You sure?

345
00:26:33,642 --> 00:26:35,701
- That's what he said.
- He said his name, just like that?

346
00:26:35,777 --> 00:26:38,109
It wasn't his secretary
saying he was on the line?

347
00:26:38,179 --> 00:26:40,147
- No, ma'am.
- All right. Put him through.

348
00:26:40,215 --> 00:26:41,341
Okay.

349
00:26:41,416 --> 00:26:43,179
(TELEPHONE RINGING)

350
00:26:44,753 --> 00:26:47,620
- This is Madeleine White.
- Miss White, I'm Arthur Case.

351
00:26:47,689 --> 00:26:49,156
Oh, good morning, Mr. Case.

352
00:26:49,224 --> 00:26:53,126
- Have we met formally?
- No, sir, I don't believe we have.

353
00:26:53,828 --> 00:26:56,456
Yet, you're always turning up

354
00:26:56,531 --> 00:26:58,897
at my July 4th parties in Southampton.

355
00:27:00,602 --> 00:27:03,628
Yes, we know some of the same people.

356
00:27:03,705 --> 00:27:05,002
It seems.

357
00:27:05,073 --> 00:27:07,303
I'll come right to the point.

358
00:27:08,009 --> 00:27:10,705
I have a small problem
which requires someone

359
00:27:10,779 --> 00:27:14,078
with very special skills
and complete discretion.

360
00:27:14,816 --> 00:27:17,979
Are you such a person
or have I been misinformed?

361
00:27:18,687 --> 00:27:19,847
Go on.

362
00:27:20,622 --> 00:27:23,591
Can I pick you up in front of
your office building in five minutes?

363
00:27:23,658 --> 00:27:25,956
- I'll be downstairs.
- Thank you.

364
00:27:31,566 --> 00:27:35,002
They had a kind of genius plan

365
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:37,595
for throwing us out of whack

366
00:27:37,672 --> 00:27:42,075
and depriving us
of any kind of way of controlling ourselves.

367
00:27:42,143 --> 00:27:44,236
They were... They were very

368
00:27:46,748 --> 00:27:49,808
insistent, and yet, strangely detached.

369
00:27:49,884 --> 00:27:53,786
All I know is that they called each other
a variation of Steve.

370
00:27:54,322 --> 00:27:56,950
Steven, Steve-O, Stevie.

371
00:27:57,025 --> 00:27:58,253
And they called you what?

372
00:27:58,326 --> 00:28:00,317
They didn't call me anything.
They just told me...

373
00:28:00,395 --> 00:28:03,489
You're lying to me. Tell me the truth, now.
You're lying to me.

374
00:28:03,565 --> 00:28:05,430
Tell me the...
Look at me and tell me the truth.

375
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:08,128
They had AK-47 s out. Four of them.

376
00:28:08,203 --> 00:28:09,966
- You know a lot about guns.
- No.

377
00:28:10,038 --> 00:28:13,007
- I don't know anything about guns, except...
- But you know they had an AK-47.

378
00:28:13,074 --> 00:28:16,134
- Everybody knows what an AK-47 is.
- Everybody?

379
00:28:16,211 --> 00:28:20,147
Anybody who's ever watched
a decent action movie would.

380
00:28:20,215 --> 00:28:22,843
- You ever rob a bank before?
- Are you kidding?

381
00:28:22,917 --> 00:28:25,613
Me rob a bank? No.

382
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:27,845
- Never stole a dollar?
- Never.

383
00:28:27,922 --> 00:28:30,220
- Never?
- Not ever.

384
00:28:30,291 --> 00:28:33,385
- You know what?
- That one time. That one time, that one time.

385
00:28:33,461 --> 00:28:36,919
I stole a nickel
from my grandmother's pocketbook once.

386
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:40,124
She was Polish.

387
00:28:40,769 --> 00:28:45,035
I used to go up to her and say,
"Mama, toh nicklah, toh nicklah."

388
00:28:46,674 --> 00:28:51,168
One day, I opened her pocketbook
and there was a nickel.

389
00:28:51,246 --> 00:28:52,611
I took it.

390
00:28:52,914 --> 00:28:55,109
That was the only thing I ever took.

391
00:28:58,953 --> 00:29:01,786
Look, Detective, I didn't mean
to give you a hard time back there.

392
00:29:01,856 --> 00:29:04,051
Forget about it. What's the story, Captain?

393
00:29:04,125 --> 00:29:07,891
Well, the hostage they let go
was Herman Gluck, 73.

394
00:29:07,962 --> 00:29:10,362
He was having chest pains.
Paramedics have him.

395
00:29:10,431 --> 00:29:13,958
They told him to say
that if any cops came near the door,

396
00:29:14,035 --> 00:29:16,367
they'd throw out two dead bodies.

397
00:29:16,437 --> 00:29:20,339
He thinks there's four perps.
Says they came in dressed as painters.

398
00:29:21,276 --> 00:29:23,744
There's a video system in the bank.

399
00:29:24,112 --> 00:29:25,739
We're working on getting a download

400
00:29:25,814 --> 00:29:29,215
from Manhattan Trust's
central security office, but it'll take a while.

401
00:29:29,284 --> 00:29:32,651
We got the block locked up.
I got men in the windows.

402
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:35,450
We're checking on the sewers with D.E.P.

403
00:29:35,523 --> 00:29:36,854
What about the phones?

404
00:29:36,925 --> 00:29:40,827
Cut and diverted into M.C.C.
We're the only ones they're gonna call.

405
00:29:41,095 --> 00:29:45,623
Cell phones are monitored
and we can jam the air whenever you say.

406
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:48,931
But we like to leave it clear
in case a hostage is able to get through,

407
00:29:49,003 --> 00:29:51,164
but so far nothing.

408
00:29:51,673 --> 00:29:54,198
- 911?
- It's up on the screen.

409
00:29:54,275 --> 00:29:57,301
Any call about a bank
gets routed straight to us.

410
00:29:57,545 --> 00:30:01,174
Well, that's my end of it, Detective.

411
00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:03,442
Yeah.

412
00:30:04,586 --> 00:30:06,451
Yeah, I'm not calling them yet.

413
00:30:06,521 --> 00:30:08,113
Beg your pardon?

414
00:30:08,857 --> 00:30:10,484
Doesn't feel right yet,
you know what I mean?

415
00:30:10,558 --> 00:30:12,458
I'm not gonna call him
and ask what I can do for him.

416
00:30:12,527 --> 00:30:14,290
Let's see what he does.

417
00:30:15,463 --> 00:30:16,794
Your call.

418
00:30:24,839 --> 00:30:27,501
Now, Mr. Case, why don't you
let me explain to you how I work?

419
00:30:27,575 --> 00:30:29,543
Please. That would be nice.

420
00:30:29,911 --> 00:30:34,610
Well, you say that there are family heirlooms
inside your safety deposit box.

421
00:30:34,682 --> 00:30:36,081
That's fine.

422
00:30:36,150 --> 00:30:39,847
But in my experience, people like you
have people working for them

423
00:30:39,921 --> 00:30:41,388
that handle these kinds of things.

424
00:30:41,456 --> 00:30:44,425
And when they can't,
well, they don't call me.

425
00:30:44,492 --> 00:30:46,289
Their people call me.

426
00:30:46,527 --> 00:30:49,553
So, immediately, I know
that there's something in that box

427
00:30:49,631 --> 00:30:52,930
that you don't even want
your closest aides to know about.

428
00:30:53,768 --> 00:30:55,395
No problem with me.

429
00:30:55,470 --> 00:30:59,634
You tell me I don't need to know
what's in that box and I don't need to know.

430
00:30:59,707 --> 00:31:02,608
But if you tell me
that it's a bunch of old baseball cards

431
00:31:02,677 --> 00:31:06,636
and I find out that it's the launch codes
for a nuclear missile,

432
00:31:07,181 --> 00:31:10,446
then let's just say
we no longer have an agreement.

433
00:31:10,518 --> 00:31:12,486
- Have you finished?
- Yes.

434
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,813
What's inside that box, young lady,

435
00:31:14,889 --> 00:31:17,619
has belonged to me
since before you were born.

436
00:31:17,759 --> 00:31:21,889
It's very valuable
and poses no danger whatsoever to anyone.

437
00:31:22,430 --> 00:31:23,795
Except you.

438
00:31:25,633 --> 00:31:28,431
Okay. Well, first,
there are men with guns in there,

439
00:31:28,503 --> 00:31:30,334
so I can't guarantee any results. Agreed?

440
00:31:30,405 --> 00:31:32,134
- Of course.
- All right.

441
00:31:32,206 --> 00:31:35,141
Now, what makes you think
that they want to rob your box?

442
00:31:35,209 --> 00:31:36,437
I don't.

443
00:31:37,612 --> 00:31:41,241
Well, why don't you tell me
how you would like this to end?

444
00:31:42,917 --> 00:31:47,854
I'd prefer that nobody
ever touch my safe deposit box.

445
00:31:48,122 --> 00:31:50,920
Not them, not you, not the authorities.

446
00:31:50,992 --> 00:31:53,859
And the sooner this situation ends,
the happier I'll be.

447
00:31:53,928 --> 00:31:56,624
- Is that specific enough for you?
- No.

448
00:31:59,233 --> 00:32:01,201
The contents of that box

449
00:32:03,471 --> 00:32:05,462
are of great value to me.

450
00:32:06,774 --> 00:32:08,901
So long as they remain my secret.

451
00:32:08,977 --> 00:32:10,877
And if they're exposed?

452
00:32:19,821 --> 00:32:21,812
I'll face some difficult questions.

453
00:32:21,990 --> 00:32:25,255
- So, it stays locked or it disappears.
- Precisely.

454
00:32:25,326 --> 00:32:27,624
- Can you make that happen?
- Yes.

455
00:32:27,695 --> 00:32:31,062
I hope so.
I have to say, I can't help but be skeptical.

456
00:32:31,132 --> 00:32:34,067
Whoever gave you my number
got the same deal.

457
00:32:34,235 --> 00:32:36,931
Clearly, they must have been satisfied.

458
00:32:44,812 --> 00:32:45,972
Steve?

459
00:32:46,347 --> 00:32:48,212
It's time for Steve-O.

460
00:32:55,023 --> 00:32:58,049
I came out here to take a look
at the perimeter they laid down.

461
00:32:58,126 --> 00:32:59,491
Guess what I found?

462
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:02,996
That hostage they let out said these guys
came in dressed like painters, right?

463
00:33:03,064 --> 00:33:04,156
Yeah.

464
00:33:14,475 --> 00:33:16,033
Probably stolen.

465
00:33:16,110 --> 00:33:18,578
Have them run it and check it for prints.

466
00:33:23,084 --> 00:33:26,053
- Everybody on?
- Yep, I'm there.

467
00:33:27,055 --> 00:33:28,784
(TELEPHONE RINGING)

468
00:33:37,298 --> 00:33:40,199
- Sure you got the right number?
- Absolutely.

469
00:33:50,578 --> 00:33:52,273
Okay. Nothing yet.

470
00:33:55,016 --> 00:33:56,244
We got video.

471
00:33:56,317 --> 00:33:57,716
Let's have it.

472
00:34:00,521 --> 00:34:02,489
FRAZIER: What happened to that camera
right there?

473
00:34:02,557 --> 00:34:04,889
ROURKE: Wait. Hold on, hold on, hold on.

474
00:34:08,830 --> 00:34:10,388
FRAZIER: Yeah, there it is.
That guy right there.

475
00:34:10,465 --> 00:34:13,798
It's like he blinds the camera
with the flashlight.

476
00:34:13,868 --> 00:34:16,393
It's weird, isn't it?
It's like nobody else sees it.

477
00:34:16,471 --> 00:34:19,304
- You'd think it'd be pretty bright, huh?
- It could be infrared.

478
00:34:19,373 --> 00:34:21,500
- What's that?
- Infrared bulb.

479
00:34:21,976 --> 00:34:24,570
See, humans can't see it,
but a video camera will pick it up.

480
00:34:24,645 --> 00:34:26,670
He could knock out the cameras
without no one knowing.

481
00:34:26,747 --> 00:34:27,975
FRAZIER: Right, right, right, right.

482
00:34:28,049 --> 00:34:29,846
ROURKE: He knocked out
the cameras about 10:00.

483
00:34:29,917 --> 00:34:32,044
So, for approximately two minutes,

484
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:35,851
we got no evidence of people
leaving or entering the bank. That's great.

485
00:34:35,923 --> 00:34:38,949
MITCHELL: Miriam, how long were you there
before it began?

486
00:34:39,026 --> 00:34:40,550
It was just a few minutes.

487
00:34:40,628 --> 00:34:43,791
Well, can you tell us what happened
after the explosions and the smoke?

488
00:34:43,865 --> 00:34:48,199
They just told us to put our heads down.
And then close our eyes.

489
00:34:48,269 --> 00:34:51,261
And then I just remember one of them

490
00:34:51,339 --> 00:34:54,103
telling the others to just go down
and fix the cameras.

491
00:34:54,175 --> 00:34:56,040
- The video cameras?
- I don't know.

492
00:34:56,144 --> 00:34:58,169
Anything else you want to share with us?

493
00:34:58,246 --> 00:34:59,304
No, just...

494
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:01,177
- You sure?
- Yeah, I...

495
00:35:01,315 --> 00:35:04,341
Could you give us
the names of the bank robbers, maybe?

496
00:35:04,418 --> 00:35:06,409
I'm just messing with you, sweetheart.

497
00:35:06,487 --> 00:35:07,886
- You okay?
- Thank you.

498
00:35:07,955 --> 00:35:09,047
Okay.

499
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:11,124
- It was pretty awful.
- Was it bad?

500
00:35:11,192 --> 00:35:13,353
I mean, they made us strip.

501
00:35:13,961 --> 00:35:16,429
They made us take off our clothes.

502
00:35:18,099 --> 00:35:20,863
I don't understand why they had to do that.

503
00:35:20,935 --> 00:35:22,459
I really just thought...

504
00:35:22,537 --> 00:35:24,869
I thought I was gonna be killed.

505
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:26,732
Well.

506
00:35:28,809 --> 00:35:30,868
- All right, my dear.
- Okay.

507
00:35:31,679 --> 00:35:33,408
- I can go?
- No.

508
00:35:33,481 --> 00:35:35,176
- No?
- No, you got to stay.

509
00:35:35,249 --> 00:35:36,739
- You got to stay.
- No, you can go.

510
00:35:36,817 --> 00:35:39,012
No, stay. No, go.

511
00:35:39,086 --> 00:35:40,644
Did you rob the bank?

512
00:35:40,721 --> 00:35:41,983
- You did.
- Did you rob the bank?

513
00:35:42,056 --> 00:35:43,523
- No.
- You sure?

514
00:35:44,025 --> 00:35:46,289
- BERK: There's movement at the front door.
- Let's go.

515
00:35:49,764 --> 00:35:52,756
HERNANDEZ: Put down the fucking weapon!
VIKRAM: Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

516
00:35:52,833 --> 00:35:54,698
HERNANDEZ: Don't move! Don't move!

517
00:35:54,769 --> 00:35:56,100
COP: He's got a device on him there.

518
00:35:56,170 --> 00:35:59,401
I said put your hands on your head
and get down on your fucking knees!

519
00:35:59,473 --> 00:36:02,237
I said put your hands on your head
and down on your knees now!

520
00:36:02,310 --> 00:36:03,743
COP: Hands are tied!
HERNANDEZ: Hands are tied.

521
00:36:03,811 --> 00:36:05,972
- Jesus, pat him down.
- All right.

522
00:36:06,047 --> 00:36:07,947
- VIKRAM: I'm one of the hostages!
- Careful.

523
00:36:08,015 --> 00:36:09,380
HERNANDEZ: Easy, be very careful,
now. Easy.

524
00:36:09,450 --> 00:36:10,883
SNIPER 1: I can't see him from where I'm at.

525
00:36:10,952 --> 00:36:13,750
SNIPER 2: I can see him. I got a clear shot.
HERNANDEZ: Any weapons?

526
00:36:14,088 --> 00:36:16,352
- Who are you?
- Vikram Walia. I work in the bank.

527
00:36:16,424 --> 00:36:18,585
Okay. Vikram? Is this a bomb?

528
00:36:18,659 --> 00:36:20,923
- Oh, shit! A fucking Arab!
- What? No. I'm a Sikh!

529
00:36:20,995 --> 00:36:22,053
- Is that a bomb?
- No.

530
00:36:22,129 --> 00:36:23,289
- Answer me, Vikram. Is this a bomb?
- No.

531
00:36:23,364 --> 00:36:24,763
- Are you booby-trapped?
- No, fuck, no.

532
00:36:24,832 --> 00:36:26,493
Okay, Vikram, I need you to relax.

533
00:36:26,567 --> 00:36:29,195
- Jesus, give me a hand.
- I don't know.

534
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:31,329
SNIPER 1: Just watch.
There's a lot of movement in that bank.

535
00:36:31,405 --> 00:36:32,872
- Team, take him down.
- Mike, now, get him.

536
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:34,373
What the fuck? Easy, easy.

537
00:36:34,442 --> 00:36:37,104
Get off my... That's my turban. Get off. Easy.

538
00:36:37,878 --> 00:36:40,711
Get... My turban!
Look, fuck, give my turban back!

539
00:36:40,781 --> 00:36:42,146
Come on, shut up. Relax.

540
00:36:42,216 --> 00:36:44,081
What the fuck are you doing?
Give me my turban back.

541
00:36:44,151 --> 00:36:45,846
- You can't fucking rip my turban.
- Shut up, already.

542
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,080
- What the fuck?
- Come on, move it.

543
00:36:47,154 --> 00:36:49,088
Get your fucking hands off me!

544
00:36:53,594 --> 00:36:55,221
And the 11:00 and 12:00...

545
00:36:55,296 --> 00:36:58,424
And don't forget about your 1:00
with Chancellor Joel Klein.

546
00:36:58,499 --> 00:37:00,865
- Oh, Madge. What a day...
- Your Honor.

547
00:37:00,935 --> 00:37:02,664
Madeleine! How are you?

548
00:37:02,737 --> 00:37:05,297
I'm just fine, but thank you for seeing me
on such short notice.

549
00:37:05,373 --> 00:37:08,638
- Sure. Madge, are we through here?
- Yes, Mr. Mayor.

550
00:37:08,909 --> 00:37:10,706
This way, Miss White.

551
00:37:11,345 --> 00:37:15,645
I always have time to put on a tux
and eat free food for a good cause.

552
00:37:15,716 --> 00:37:17,581
Who are we saving this week?

553
00:37:17,652 --> 00:37:19,415
Well, I'm doing a round of support

554
00:37:19,487 --> 00:37:22,422
for the Joseph Freidkin Memorial Fund
for Spinal Cord Research

555
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:24,549
and we're having
our annual fundraiser next month.

556
00:37:24,625 --> 00:37:26,593
If you could attend,
it would give us such a boost.

557
00:37:26,661 --> 00:37:30,597
It would be my pleasure.
Is there anything else I can do to...

558
00:37:31,365 --> 00:37:33,697
- What the fuck do you want?
- A favor.

559
00:37:33,768 --> 00:37:37,602
- No shit. Which kind?
- The last one I'll ever ask of you.

560
00:37:38,105 --> 00:37:40,335
That's the kind I had in mind.

561
00:37:40,541 --> 00:37:42,975
You know about this hostage situation.

562
00:37:43,044 --> 00:37:45,274
On my way. What's it to do with you?

563
00:37:45,346 --> 00:37:47,473
All right, well, I need to keep an eye on it.

564
00:37:47,548 --> 00:37:50,574
So, I want you to bring me down there
and tell whoever's in charge

565
00:37:50,651 --> 00:37:52,642
to extend me every courtesy.

566
00:37:55,523 --> 00:37:57,855
You're out of your fucking mind.

567
00:37:58,426 --> 00:38:01,156
If it was easy,
it wouldn't square us, would it?

568
00:38:01,429 --> 00:38:04,592
- It's impossible.
- Nothing's impossible.

569
00:38:04,665 --> 00:38:06,826
You just have to call in a few markers,
that's all.

570
00:38:06,901 --> 00:38:09,096
I may have to give out a few.

571
00:38:09,737 --> 00:38:12,228
Then that's exactly what you'll do.

572
00:38:13,607 --> 00:38:15,632
You're a magnificent cunt.

573
00:38:19,013 --> 00:38:20,344
Thank you.

574
00:38:24,185 --> 00:38:27,382
It's been a very tense situation
for several hours now.

575
00:38:27,455 --> 00:38:29,821
It's unclear how many hostages are inside

576
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:32,324
and how many robbers
police are dealing with.

577
00:38:32,393 --> 00:38:35,658
Officials say this all started out
as a robbery at Manhattan Trust,

578
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:38,631
but has turned into this hostage situation.

579
00:38:38,699 --> 00:38:41,497
Negotiators are here on the scene,
working very hard

580
00:38:41,569 --> 00:38:44,231
and it's still unclear
on any possible injuries.

581
00:38:44,305 --> 00:38:46,569
Of course, we'll keep you up to date
with the very latest

582
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:49,609
and we will remain here on the scene
as this all unfolds.

583
00:38:49,677 --> 00:38:51,611
That's the latest from here
in lower Manhattan.

584
00:38:51,679 --> 00:38:54,409
Reporting live, I'm Sandra Endo.
Back to you.

585
00:38:54,482 --> 00:38:57,417
VIKRAM: "Protect and serve" my ass.
Where's my turban?

586
00:38:57,952 --> 00:38:59,943
I'm not talking to anybody without a turban.

587
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:03,114
It's part of my religion, to cover my head
in respect to God. I'm a Sikh.

588
00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:04,487
MITCHELL: Okay, we'll find your turban.

589
00:39:04,558 --> 00:39:06,856
Not an Arab, by the way,
like your cops called me outside.

590
00:39:06,927 --> 00:39:08,952
Now, no, I don't think you heard that.

591
00:39:09,029 --> 00:39:11,361
There was a lot going on.
You were probably disoriented.

592
00:39:11,432 --> 00:39:13,400
- I didn't hear that.
- I heard what I heard.

593
00:39:13,467 --> 00:39:15,560
I'll give you all the information you want.

594
00:39:15,636 --> 00:39:18,537
I don't need this. I need my turban.
It's part of my religion.

595
00:39:18,606 --> 00:39:20,665
- We'll get you your turban.
- We'll find it for you.

596
00:39:20,741 --> 00:39:23,175
No, no, no. Not "get me."
I want my turban now.

597
00:39:23,244 --> 00:39:25,974
You just got to start thinking
about the people inside the bank now.

598
00:39:26,046 --> 00:39:27,104
It's a dangerous situation.

599
00:39:27,181 --> 00:39:29,649
You got to start telling us
about what's going on inside the bank.

600
00:39:29,717 --> 00:39:32,151
We can talk about this later.
We'll get an officer to come down.

601
00:39:32,219 --> 00:39:33,686
You can write a formal complaint.

602
00:39:33,754 --> 00:39:36,120
But for now,
we got to deal with this situation.

603
00:39:36,190 --> 00:39:38,249
First you beat me,
and now you want my help.

604
00:39:38,325 --> 00:39:40,987
You need to start thinking
about your coworkers.

605
00:39:41,061 --> 00:39:44,622
I could apologize on behalf of the NYPD,
but that was not us. We are detectives.

606
00:39:44,698 --> 00:39:46,757
- We're gonna try and find out...
- What do you want to know?

607
00:39:46,834 --> 00:39:49,462
- How many were there?
- I think there were about four.

608
00:39:49,537 --> 00:39:53,303
- How many hostages?
- I don't know how many hostages, 20, 30.

609
00:39:54,742 --> 00:39:58,701
I'm fucking tired of this shit.
What happened to my fucking civil rights?

610
00:39:58,779 --> 00:40:01,646
Why can't I go anywhere
without being harassed?

611
00:40:01,715 --> 00:40:03,945
I get thrown out of a bank.
I'm a hostage. I get harassed.

612
00:40:04,018 --> 00:40:05,144
I go to the airport.

613
00:40:05,219 --> 00:40:08,017
I can't go through security
without a "random" selection.

614
00:40:08,088 --> 00:40:09,919
Fucking random, my ass.
I nearly lost my job...

615
00:40:09,990 --> 00:40:12,322
I bet you can get a cab, though.

616
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:15,285
I guess that's one of the perks.

617
00:40:15,896 --> 00:40:17,887
Put the ice on your face.

618
00:40:22,269 --> 00:40:25,636
FRAZIER: "Two buses with full gas tanks.
One jumbo jet with full gas tank

619
00:40:25,706 --> 00:40:28,368
"and pilots at JFK,
parked at the end of runway. "

620
00:40:28,442 --> 00:40:30,103
They give us until 9:00 pm to do this,

621
00:40:30,177 --> 00:40:32,645
then they kill one hostage every hour
in front of TV cameras.

622
00:40:32,713 --> 00:40:36,171
"Bank is secured with Semtex.
We will demonstrate if necessary."

623
00:40:36,250 --> 00:40:40,152
- Whatever you do, don't give them a jet.
- There's no plane. Maybe a bus. Maybe.

624
00:40:40,221 --> 00:40:42,883
Till I talk to them, they get nothing.
Not even a cup of coffee.

625
00:40:42,957 --> 00:40:44,083
For now, we wait.

626
00:40:44,158 --> 00:40:46,592
Let's let them wonder
what we're doing, okay?

627
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:48,924
Excuse me, Detectives. This is Arthur Case.

628
00:40:48,996 --> 00:40:51,590
- He's the...
- I'm Chairman, Board of Directors.

629
00:40:51,665 --> 00:40:54,759
- Of the bank. You wanna talk to him?
- Absolutely.

630
00:40:54,835 --> 00:40:57,497
Mr. Case, how are you?
I'm Detective Frazier.

631
00:40:57,571 --> 00:40:59,971
Anything in particular
you think we should know?

632
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:04,067
No. I just wondered
if I might be of some assistance.

633
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:09,172
- Have they made any demands?
- They want a jet.

634
00:41:10,150 --> 00:41:11,481
Oh, I see.

635
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:16,519
Would you like me to arrange one for you?

636
00:41:23,063 --> 00:41:25,429
I'm so sorry. I must have misunderstood.

637
00:41:25,499 --> 00:41:27,933
That's quite all right, Mr. Case.

638
00:41:28,569 --> 00:41:30,366
Where can we reach you
if we need anything?

639
00:41:30,437 --> 00:41:32,302
Well, those are my people in there,
you know,

640
00:41:32,373 --> 00:41:35,274
and I would like to stay here for a while.
And I won't disturb you.

641
00:41:35,342 --> 00:41:37,367
CASE: I'll be very quiet right down...
MITCHELL: Sergeant Collins!

642
00:41:37,444 --> 00:41:40,675
Mr. Case, we'll try and keep you posted
as best we can,

643
00:41:40,748 --> 00:41:42,716
but you're gonna have to excuse us
for now, okay?

644
00:41:42,783 --> 00:41:44,478
COLLINS: Right this way, sir.
FRAZIER: Thank you very much.

645
00:41:44,552 --> 00:41:45,712
- Absolutely.
- This way, sir.

646
00:41:45,786 --> 00:41:48,448
- FRAZIER: Thank you very much.
- And thank you all so much.

647
00:41:48,522 --> 00:41:49,989
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

648
00:41:50,057 --> 00:41:51,547
This way, sir.

649
00:42:25,726 --> 00:42:28,286
"Fifty hungry people need food now."

650
00:42:38,739 --> 00:42:40,900
All right.
Are we ready with the listening devices?

651
00:42:40,975 --> 00:42:43,205
I'm gonna need 15 minutes
once we get the food.

652
00:42:43,277 --> 00:42:45,245
Pizza's the best. No sandwiches.

653
00:42:45,312 --> 00:42:47,280
MITCHELL: Is she for real?
FRAZIER: Are you for real?

654
00:42:47,348 --> 00:42:50,647
Well, if we send in, say,
10 pizzas boxes with transmitters,

655
00:42:50,718 --> 00:42:53,516
maybe we'll get some conversation
if we give them something to group around.

656
00:42:53,587 --> 00:42:55,555
Give them each a sandwich, it's hit or miss.

657
00:42:55,623 --> 00:42:58,285
They can move around

00:53:09,769 --> 00:53:12,033
MAN: (ON VIDEO GAME) Yo, yo, yo.
There go that motherfucker right there.

828
00:53:12,105 --> 00:53:14,733
Hey, yo, you thought you was gonna
get away with that shit, didn't you?

829
00:53:14,808 --> 00:53:16,332
DALTON: How does this game work?

830
00:53:16,409 --> 00:53:20,539
You get points for doing dirt,
like jacking a car or selling crack.

831
00:53:20,847 --> 00:53:24,305
And you lose points
if someone jacks your ride or shoots you.

832
00:53:24,851 --> 00:53:26,250
Come on, baby.

833
00:53:26,319 --> 00:53:28,913
Take that! Take this! What? What? What?

834
00:53:28,989 --> 00:53:31,048
Talk shit now! I don't hear you!

835
00:53:31,157 --> 00:53:33,785
Eat this! Eat that! Eat this! Eat that!

836
00:53:33,994 --> 00:53:36,326
You're gone, baby! You're dead! Bye-bye!

837
00:53:36,396 --> 00:53:37,556
DALTON: Jesus!

838
00:53:38,231 --> 00:53:39,926
What's the point of this?

839
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:43,458
Like my man 50 says,
"Get rich or die tryin'."

840
00:53:44,237 --> 00:53:47,138
Yo, you'd get mad points
for knocking over the bank.

841
00:53:47,207 --> 00:53:51,200
- You think that's cool?
- Hell, yeah. You trying to get paid, too.

842
00:53:51,444 --> 00:53:53,002
(DALTON CHUCKLES)

843
00:53:55,215 --> 00:53:57,843
Finish your slice.
I'll take you back to your father.

844
00:53:59,719 --> 00:54:01,710
I got to talk to him about this game.

845
00:54:10,063 --> 00:54:12,293
- Is it good?
- No doubt.

846
00:54:15,869 --> 00:54:17,336
It's gonna be okay.

847
00:54:18,371 --> 00:54:19,463
Cool.

848
00:54:20,140 --> 00:54:21,607
You'll be home soon.

849
00:54:22,275 --> 00:54:23,708
That's whassup.

850
00:54:29,115 --> 00:54:30,275
- Sir?
- Yeah.

851
00:54:30,350 --> 00:54:32,341
- No luck with the Albanian Consulate.
- What do you mean?

852
00:54:32,419 --> 00:54:34,944
I couldn't tell what the guy
was talking about. I think he wanted money.

853
00:54:35,021 --> 00:54:37,046
And I tried the State Department.
That takes a month.

854
00:54:37,123 --> 00:54:38,249
Okay.

855
00:54:38,658 --> 00:54:40,523
- Call her.
- Are you crazy?

856
00:54:40,593 --> 00:54:42,959
- I hate that bitch. Come on.
- You said she speaks Albanian, right?

857
00:54:43,029 --> 00:54:44,929
- Yeah, she was born there.
- Call her.

858
00:54:45,365 --> 00:54:46,832
I'm gonna regret this.

859
00:55:27,640 --> 00:55:29,699
- Who's Detective Frazier?
- Right here.

860
00:55:29,776 --> 00:55:32,370
- I have Ilina Maria over here.
- Miritia.

861
00:55:32,445 --> 00:55:33,912
- Oh, how you doing?
- Hello.

862
00:55:33,980 --> 00:55:35,242
How you doing?

863
00:55:35,949 --> 00:55:38,850
- What's this?
- Parking tickets. You can fix them?

864
00:55:40,854 --> 00:55:43,049
Yeah, I'll see what I can do.

865
00:55:43,356 --> 00:55:45,916
Can you listen to this
and tell us what they're saying?

866
00:55:45,992 --> 00:55:47,789
You can't smoke in here.

867
00:55:50,830 --> 00:55:52,229
Shit. Go ahead.

868
00:56:02,809 --> 00:56:05,334
What's so funny?
What, you know what they're talking about?

869
00:56:05,412 --> 00:56:08,540
I know what they're talking about.
I even know who it is.

870
00:56:08,615 --> 00:56:10,708
You know who it is?
You mean you know their names?

871
00:56:10,784 --> 00:56:12,547
- Who? I mean, who is it?
- Parking tickets?

872
00:56:12,619 --> 00:56:15,179
- They're taken care of. Who is it?
- It's Enver Hoxha.

873
00:56:15,255 --> 00:56:17,951
- Who?
- He was the president of Albania.

874
00:56:18,491 --> 00:56:19,515
Wait.

875
00:56:19,592 --> 00:56:22,493
You're telling me the former president
of Albania is in there robbing a bank?

876
00:56:22,562 --> 00:56:23,824
Enver Hoxha's dead.

877
00:56:23,897 --> 00:56:27,094
That's a tape of him discussing
how Albanian people are great people.

878
00:56:27,167 --> 00:56:29,658
They are immortal people. I wouldn't worry.

879
00:56:31,504 --> 00:56:33,563
It's a tape. You're sure about that?

880
00:56:33,673 --> 00:56:35,834
I had to listen to all this nonsense
in school.

881
00:56:35,909 --> 00:56:40,209
"Communism is great. Capitalism is evil.
Lenin, Marx, blah, blah, blah."

882
00:56:40,280 --> 00:56:42,214
It's Enver Hoxha. It's a tape.

883
00:56:42,282 --> 00:56:46,048
Okay. Okay, well,
Officer, you can take her home.

884
00:56:46,119 --> 00:56:49,054
And do me a favor, huh?
Watch where you park next time, okay?

885
00:56:56,663 --> 00:56:58,187
So, they're playing tapes for us now.

886
00:56:58,264 --> 00:56:59,754
They knew we were gonna bug them.

887
00:56:59,833 --> 00:57:02,495
Yeah, you're damn right they knew we were
gonna bug them. And they knew how.

888
00:57:02,569 --> 00:57:04,537
What makes it even worse,
they wanted us to bug them

889
00:57:04,604 --> 00:57:06,128
so they could send us
on a wild goose chase.

890
00:57:06,206 --> 00:57:09,073
Last time I had my johnson
pulled that good, it cost me $5.

891
00:57:09,142 --> 00:57:10,166
$5?

892
00:57:11,344 --> 00:57:13,039
Yeah, Tijuana. Don't ask.

893
00:57:14,914 --> 00:57:17,109
Look at the... Oh, fuck that.

894
00:57:17,784 --> 00:57:19,342
(MAN TALKING OVER SPEAKERS)

895
00:59:11,264 --> 00:59:13,789
- Detective Frazier. Nice to meet you.
- My pleasure.

896
00:59:13,866 --> 00:59:15,128
This is Madeleine White.

897
00:59:15,201 --> 00:59:17,669
- How do you do, Miss White?
- It's an honor, Detective.

898
00:59:17,737 --> 00:59:20,331
Miss White may be able to assist you.

899
00:59:20,506 --> 00:59:23,498
Good. Good. What do you have in mind?

900
00:59:23,576 --> 00:59:27,239
She has a certain amount of influence
in these matters

901
00:59:27,313 --> 00:59:29,941
for reasons which I can't share with you.

902
00:59:32,118 --> 00:59:33,745
What are you trying to say, sir?

903
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:36,983
What the Mayor means
is that there are matters at stake here

904
00:59:37,056 --> 00:59:39,889
that are a little bit above your pay grade.
No offense.

905
00:59:39,959 --> 00:59:42,018
And he's offering to help you.

906
00:59:42,895 --> 00:59:46,888
Well, why don't you just tell the Mayor
to raise my pay grade to the proper level

907
00:59:46,966 --> 00:59:48,433
and problem solved.

908
00:59:48,501 --> 00:59:50,867
From what I hear, that would have happened
a long time ago

909
00:59:50,970 --> 00:59:54,269
if you'd been a little bit more diplomatic.
But we can certainly discuss it.

910
00:59:54,340 --> 00:59:57,366
Look, I'm kidding. I mean,
I make First Grade when I make First Grade.

911
00:59:57,443 --> 01:00:00,276
You want to speed that up,
I'm not gonna talk you out of it.

912
01:00:00,346 --> 01:00:03,747
Then there's also the matter of $140,000
that seems to have walked away

913
01:00:03,816 --> 01:00:05,681
from the Madrugada check-cashing bust.

914
01:00:05,752 --> 01:00:06,946
Oh, I see.

915
01:00:08,554 --> 01:00:10,181
Well, I had nothing to do with that.

916
01:00:11,658 --> 01:00:13,990
HERNANDEZ: Yeah, Collins, we got snipers
in the windows here.

917
01:00:14,060 --> 01:00:16,722
We got guys in the building next door.
Guys up on the roof.

918
01:00:16,829 --> 01:00:18,922
We're trying to get the blueprints
for the bank

919
01:00:18,998 --> 01:00:21,796
so we can figure out the ventilator shaft.
Maybe we can come down.

920
01:00:26,105 --> 01:00:28,471
DALTON: Well?
FRAZIER: Is this the President of Albania?

921
01:00:28,875 --> 01:00:30,706
- Speaking.
- Pretty funny.

922
01:00:30,943 --> 01:00:33,969
- You shouldn't eavesdrop on people.
- Well, you better get used to it, pal.

923
01:00:34,047 --> 01:00:36,072
There's not gonna be much privacy
where you're going.

924
01:00:36,149 --> 01:00:37,309
You're damn right.

925
01:00:37,383 --> 01:00:40,477
This time next week,
I'll be sucking down pia coladas

926
01:00:40,553 --> 01:00:43,420
in a hot tub with six girls
named Amber and Tiffany.

927
01:00:43,656 --> 01:00:46,819
More like taking a shower with two guys
named Jamal and Jesus,

928
01:00:46,893 --> 01:00:49,453
if you know what I mean.
And here's the bad news,

929
01:00:49,529 --> 01:00:52,657
that thing you're sucking on,
it's not a pia colada.

930
01:00:55,068 --> 01:00:58,629
- Maybe you like that kind of thing, huh?
- You really want to piss me off.

931
01:00:59,105 --> 01:01:00,436
All right, here's where we stand.

932
01:01:00,506 --> 01:01:03,270
I don't need
your fucking status report, Serpico.

933
01:01:03,342 --> 01:01:04,934
I tell you where things stand.

934
01:01:05,011 --> 01:01:07,377
- Sure, sure. I just meant...
- Here's where things stand.

935
01:01:07,447 --> 01:01:09,278
You're getting me what I asked you for.

936
01:01:09,348 --> 01:01:11,248
You'll have it ready in the time I gave you

937
01:01:11,317 --> 01:01:14,616
or you'll sit by and you'll watch me do
just what I said I would do. Clear?

938
01:01:14,687 --> 01:01:16,552
Very clear.
I'm trying to get you what you want.

939
01:01:16,622 --> 01:01:18,021
But you got to understand this.

940
01:01:18,524 --> 01:01:22,392
You know, it's not like the City of New York
has 747 s waiting around for days like today.

941
01:01:22,462 --> 01:01:24,828
I understand that if you don't get
my plane ready,

942
01:01:24,897 --> 01:01:27,024
- then you might as well send a hearse.
- Please.

943
01:01:27,366 --> 01:01:29,800
Let's focus on how we can both
get what we want, all right?

944
01:01:29,869 --> 01:01:32,303
Hey! You're not listening.

945
01:01:34,140 --> 01:01:37,769
You get me what I want, I won't kill anyone.

946
01:01:38,311 --> 01:01:40,245
All right. I'm on it. I'm on it.

947
01:01:41,013 --> 01:01:43,413
Let's just try to keep everybody calm, okay?

948
01:01:43,483 --> 01:01:46,281
- Don't I sound calm to you?
- Yeah, you do.

949
01:01:49,288 --> 01:01:50,550
FRAZIER: Yeah, you do.

950
01:02:44,610 --> 01:02:47,443
- So, Mr. Damerjian...
- Damerjian.

951
01:02:47,513 --> 01:02:49,606
- Damerjian. Is that Albanian?
- Just call me Kenneth.

952
01:02:49,682 --> 01:02:51,912
- Kenneth?
- Is that Albanian or...

953
01:02:51,984 --> 01:02:53,508
It's Armenian.

954
01:02:54,253 --> 01:02:55,686
What's the difference?

955
01:02:56,455 --> 01:02:58,446
Detective, I was born in Queens.

956
01:02:59,425 --> 01:03:02,656
I've never been to Armenia, Albania.
I went surfing in Australia once.

957
01:03:02,728 --> 01:03:04,320
Can I have a glass of water?

958
01:03:04,397 --> 01:03:06,763
- Are you thirsty?
- My throat's parched.

959
01:03:06,833 --> 01:03:08,460
- I'm not nervous.
- Your throat's parched?

960
01:03:08,534 --> 01:03:10,297
- My throat's parched.
- His throat is parched.

961
01:03:10,369 --> 01:03:12,200
- I just want a glass of water.
- Oh, shit!

962
01:03:13,472 --> 01:03:15,337
When you start telling us
what really happened...

963
01:03:15,408 --> 01:03:17,273
- I just want a glass of water.
- His throat is parched.

964
01:03:17,343 --> 01:03:19,004
- Here. You want some coffee?
- No, that's all right.

965
01:03:19,078 --> 01:03:20,340
- I don't drink that stuff.
- No, go ahead.

966
01:03:20,413 --> 01:03:21,573
Did you know they were robbing the bank?

967
01:03:21,647 --> 01:03:23,842
I didn't know they were robbing the bank
until they pulled a gun in my face.

968
01:03:23,916 --> 01:03:25,406
Is that why you held the door open
for them?

969
01:03:25,484 --> 01:03:26,644
How do you know they robbed the bank?

970
01:03:26,719 --> 01:03:28,016
Because they pulled a gun in my face...

971
01:03:28,087 --> 01:03:29,418
That doesn't mean they were
robbing the bank.

972
01:03:29,488 --> 01:03:31,149
Did they take money?
Did you see them take money?

973
01:03:31,224 --> 01:03:34,853
I was in a bank and I was locked up
for who knows how long.

974
01:03:34,927 --> 01:03:37,657
- Okay.
- Tied up in a room. I saw you see me.

975
01:03:37,730 --> 01:03:39,095
You saw me see you?

976
01:03:39,165 --> 01:03:40,530
- Is that what you just said?
- Yeah.

977
01:03:40,600 --> 01:03:43,000
I was locked up in the room.
You saw me gagged when you came in.

978
01:03:43,069 --> 01:03:45,697
Listen, I can't work miracles over here.
I'm gonna need more time.

979
01:03:45,771 --> 01:03:48,569
Well, perhaps if you'd use the time
that I gave you more efficiently,

980
01:03:48,641 --> 01:03:50,165
you wouldn't be having this problem.

981
01:03:50,243 --> 01:03:52,837
- What do you want me to say?
- That my plane is ready.

982
01:03:53,646 --> 01:03:55,113
Okay, listen.

983
01:03:56,349 --> 01:03:59,978
I promise you, as God is my witness,
I'm working on it as hard as I can.

984
01:04:00,086 --> 01:04:01,849
It's just gonna take a few more hours.

985
01:04:01,921 --> 01:04:03,411
Why should I give you any more time?

986
01:04:03,489 --> 01:04:05,821
Well, it's simple. You give me more time,
you get what you want.

987
01:04:05,892 --> 01:04:07,985
You don't give me the time,
you don't get what you want.

You got nothing to lose.

Meanwhile, we'll send in some more food.

01:04:14,634 --> 01:04:17,432
I got a question for you.
You get it right, I give you more time.

991
01:04:17,503 --> 01:04:20,028
- And?
- You know what happens if you don't.

992
01:04:22,074 --> 01:04:23,632
Which weighs more?

993
01:04:24,844 --> 01:04:28,075
All the trains that pass through
Grand Central Station in a year,

994
01:04:29,248 --> 01:04:32,775
or the trees cut down to print
all US currency in circulation?

995
01:04:33,352 --> 01:04:35,843
Here's a hint. It's a trick question.

996
01:04:38,557 --> 01:04:41,082
What the hell is that? Playing games now?

997
01:04:41,160 --> 01:04:42,320
It's the trains.

998
01:04:42,395 --> 01:04:45,421
US money isn't printed on paper at all.
It's cotton.

999
01:04:45,498 --> 01:04:47,125
- Yeah, I heard that.
- Yeah, that's right.

1000
01:04:47,199 --> 01:04:48,530
- Okay.
- So no trees were cut down.

1001
01:04:48,601 --> 01:04:51,069
- Are you sure?
- Yeah. 100%.

1002
01:04:51,304 --> 01:04:52,328
Okay.

- Wait a second. Wait a second.
- I'll call you back.

1006
01:05:05,718 --> 01:05:07,982
It's a trap. They both weigh the same.

1007
01:05:08,054 --> 01:05:10,522
Tell him they both weigh the same.
They both weigh nothing.

1008

or they both weigh the same?

Do it now.

They both weigh the same. Got it.

1012

- Well?
- They both weigh the same.

1013

That's pretty good. This guy's nuts.

He said, "Grand Central Station."

1016
01:05:32,678 --> 01:05:35,340
Grand Central Terminal is the train station.

1017
01:05:35,414 --> 01:05:38,076
- Grand Central Station is the post office.
- Is the post office.

Trains don't pass through Grand Central.

It's the last stop for every train.

- What about the subway? They run through.
- Metro-North goes there.

- How the fuck do you know?
- Metro-North goes there!

1023

No. Metro-North starts there.

What are you guys talking about?
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

1025

- Metro-North goes through!
- Let's just get the sandwiches.

1026
01:05:57,236 --> 01:06:00,797
- Metro-North...
- Deal is, he said, "Passes through."

1027
01:06:00,873 --> 01:06:03,000
Yeah, but the Metro-North goes up
there, though.

- No. I was a lawyer.

Yeah, yeah, yeah. Soon.

It's gonna be a long night, though,

Why don't you let me come down there?

Because I don't want to be
distracted by you, that's why.

Well, if you're still there when I come

- I cannot wait. I cannot wait.
- So, how you doing?

It's all right. We got a couple
of the hostages out. Thanks a lot.

- I'm doing okay. I'm doing all right.

you're doing a great job. I saw you, too.

- And what's that?

Well, if I can be assured
that certain interests are protected,

what you came for.

01:08:19,845 --> 01:08:22,814
Tell me about these interests
that you are trying to protect.

1077
01:08:22,882 --> 01:08:24,543
Why don't you let me worry about that?

1078
01:08:24,617 --> 01:08:28,144
Now, what is it you were hoping to get out
of all this?

- Rich, of course.
- Of course.

Here's what I'm thinking.

1100
01:09:51,303 --> 01:09:53,863
If you give up now,
I can ensure that you'll serve the minimum.

1101
01:09:53,939 --> 01:09:56,134
I'm thinking three years,
four years at the most.

1102
01:09:56,208 --> 01:09:57,300
You can arrange that?

1103
01:09:57,376 --> 01:09:59,435
Well, you haven't hurt anyone
or stolen anything,

1104
01:09:59,511 --> 01:10:01,706
so yes, as a matter of fact, I can.

1105

- It's not good enough.
- Well, I wasn't finished.

Will I? How?

1108
01:10:10,956 --> 01:10:14,153
We'll put it someplace safe and it'll be
waiting for you when you get out.

1109
01:10:14,226 --> 01:10:15,454
Thanks.

1110
01:10:16,228 --> 01:10:17,786
But no, thanks.

1111
01:10:17,863 --> 01:10:21,094
Oh, come on. I made you such a sweet offer.

1112
01:10:21,166 --> 01:10:23,566
I really don't think you have much
in the way of alternatives.

1113
01:10:23,636 --> 01:10:27,629
Why don't you talk to me about these
interests that you're in here to protect?

1114
01:10:27,740 --> 01:10:29,401
- I'm afraid I can't.
- I can.

1115
01:10:29,475 --> 01:10:31,067
Let me tell you a story.

1116
01:10:33,712 --> 01:10:37,842
During World War II, there was an American
working for a bank in Switzerland.

1117
01:10:39,251 --> 01:10:41,776
DALTON: Now, I don't need to tell you
that this period in history

1118
01:10:41,854 --> 01:10:44,755
was rife with opportunity
for people of low morals.

1119
01:10:44,823 --> 01:10:46,791
People like this man.

1120
01:10:47,359 --> 01:10:51,625
He used his position with the Nazis
to enrich himself while all around him

1121
01:10:51,697 --> 01:10:54,257
people were being stripped
of everything they owned.

1122
01:10:55,768 --> 01:10:59,795
Then he used his blood money
to start a bank.

1123
01:10:59,872 --> 01:11:00,896
Now,

1124
01:11:02,608 --> 01:11:05,441
does this sound like
it might be the man you work for?

1125
01:11:06,378 --> 01:11:08,869
Or am I just whistling Dixie out of my ass?

1126
01:11:09,648 --> 01:11:11,843
- I believe we understand each other.
- Good.

1127
01:11:13,719 --> 01:11:15,619
So, what the hell can you do for me

1128
01:11:15,688 --> 01:11:19,385
since I clearly know more than you do,
and I've planned this to perfection?

1129
01:11:19,458 --> 01:11:23,690
Believe me, if I need to,
I can change your entire program.

1130
01:11:23,762 --> 01:11:25,855
So, the sooner
that you stop being my problem

1131
01:11:25,931 --> 01:11:29,423
and you start becoming my solution,
the better off you'll be.

1132
01:11:29,835 --> 01:11:32,030
- What is it you want?
- Two minutes.

1133
01:11:32,104 --> 01:11:34,902
The safety deposit box room.
I just need to go to one box.

1134
01:11:37,276 --> 01:11:38,800
Looking for this?

1135
01:11:40,179 --> 01:11:42,807
This could be very embarrassing
to your employer.

1136
01:11:43,615 --> 01:11:45,776
He should have destroyed this
a long time ago.

1137
01:11:45,851 --> 01:11:47,842
He didn't, so now it's mine.

1138
01:11:50,255 --> 01:11:53,224
Now, if the day ever comes
where I have to stand before a judge

1139
01:11:53,292 --> 01:11:55,192
and account for what I did here,

1140
01:11:55,260 --> 01:11:57,626
you and your boss
will do whatever it takes to help me.

1141
01:11:59,431 --> 01:12:01,558
You get out of here with that envelope,

1142
01:12:02,368 --> 01:12:04,427
and we'll pay you a lot of money.

1143
01:12:04,870 --> 01:12:06,132
I'll keep that in mind.

1144
01:12:06,205 --> 01:12:09,140
You're not gonna tell me how you're
planning to get out of here, are you?

1145
01:12:09,208 --> 01:12:12,041
I'm gonna walk right out the front door.
Anything else?

1146
01:12:12,544 --> 01:12:15,172
- How did you know about all this?
- Doesn't matter.

1147
01:12:15,247 --> 01:12:18,683
Fact is, all lies, all evil deeds, they stink.

1148
01:12:19,151 --> 01:12:22,348
You can cover them up for a while,
but they don't go away.

1149
01:12:22,588 --> 01:12:24,852
- Murder will out?
- Precisely.

1150
01:12:25,758 --> 01:12:28,090
Well, I still don't get what you're
doing here.

1151
01:12:28,160 --> 01:12:29,252
Really?

1152
01:12:30,796 --> 01:12:31,820
DALTON: Good.

1153
01:12:36,335 --> 01:12:37,461
So, we spoke.

1154
01:12:37,536 --> 01:12:39,265
Oh, no. You're gonna have to give me
more than that.

1155
01:12:39,338 --> 01:12:40,999
- Let me have this window, fellows.
- Yes, sir.

1156
01:12:41,073 --> 01:12:43,906
I told him that, well,
since he hadn't killed anyone,

1157
01:12:43,976 --> 01:12:46,945
it wasn't too late to surrender
and get off with a lighter sentence.

1158
01:12:47,012 --> 01:12:48,070
And?

1159
01:12:48,814 --> 01:12:50,714
And that was basically it.

1160
01:12:52,050 --> 01:12:54,109
You know, I don't ordinarily get offended

1161
01:12:54,186 --> 01:12:57,417
the first time somebody treats me
like an idiot, but you are pushing it.

1162
01:12:57,489 --> 01:13:01,084
Now, I know you did not go in there
to tell this guy something he already knew.

1163
01:13:01,160 --> 01:13:02,491
Talk to me.

1164
01:13:03,028 --> 01:13:04,120
Look, Detective.

1165
01:13:04,196 --> 01:13:06,687
Our arrangement doesn't include me
giving you a detailed explanation.

1166
01:13:06,765 --> 01:13:08,562
I say it does, okay?

1167
01:13:08,934 --> 01:13:10,333
Okay, you don't own me.

1168
01:13:10,402 --> 01:13:13,599
This check-cashing thing, this coke bust,
I can face that on my own.

1169
01:13:13,672 --> 01:13:16,197
I know what I did and what I didn't do.

1170
01:13:16,275 --> 01:13:18,743
- Talk to me.
- Off the record?

1171
01:13:18,811 --> 01:13:22,303
"Off the..." Everything about you
is off the record. Just talk to me.

1172
01:13:23,081 --> 01:13:25,174
- Well, I gave him an incentive.
- Okay.

1173
01:13:25,551 --> 01:13:29,578
- Did he go for it?
- No. But I'd say he's considering it.

1174
01:13:30,923 --> 01:13:32,618
He's smart, isn't he?

1175
01:13:32,858 --> 01:13:34,553
- He thinks he is.
- Yeah.

1176
01:13:35,060 --> 01:13:37,654
One of your types, like the Ivy League type?

1177
01:13:38,263 --> 01:13:40,731
- Clearly well educated.
- That's what I'm talking about.

1178
01:13:41,033 --> 01:13:42,933
That's exactly what I'm talking about.

1179
01:13:43,202 --> 01:13:46,968
You talk like him, so think like him.
What do you think he's gonna do?

1180
01:13:48,841 --> 01:13:51,241
- Well, he's not gonna kill anyone.
- How do you know?

1181
01:13:51,310 --> 01:13:53,608
- Because he's not a murderer.
- How do you know?

1182
01:13:54,179 --> 01:13:56,340
I got news for you.
Most of the guys up in Sing Sing

1183
01:13:56,415 --> 01:13:58,144
weren't murderers
until they killed somebody.

1184
01:13:58,217 --> 01:14:01,414
You never know what a person will do
until you push him into a corner.

1185
01:14:02,454 --> 01:14:04,888
But it doesn't seem
like you've pushed him into a corner.

1186
01:14:04,957 --> 01:14:08,358
It doesn't, does it?
Seems more like he chose the corner.

1187
01:14:09,962 --> 01:14:11,259
You're right.

1188
01:14:12,264 --> 01:14:13,822
So, you through?

1189
01:14:14,867 --> 01:14:17,131
- I guess. Are you saying I'm dismissed?
- Yes, I am.

1190
01:14:17,202 --> 01:14:19,295
You got a card, in case I need to call you?

1191
01:14:20,405 --> 01:14:23,306
Please don't take this personally, but no.

1192
01:14:23,475 --> 01:14:25,067
I don't think you can afford me.

1193
01:14:25,143 --> 01:14:28,579
Well, don't take this personally, Miss White.
Kiss my black ass, okay?

1194
01:14:29,281 --> 01:14:33,479
Careful, Detective Frazier.
My bite's much worse than my bark.

1195
01:14:39,491 --> 01:14:41,584
- So, how old are you, Brian?
- Eight and three-quarters.

1196
01:14:41,660 --> 01:14:44,254
Eight and three-quarters. Big boy.

1197
01:14:45,464 --> 01:14:47,591
- Were you scared in there?
- No.

1198
01:14:47,666 --> 01:14:50,328
- No? Not at all, huh?
- Nope. I'm from Brooklyn.

1199
01:14:50,402 --> 01:14:52,029
You're from Brooklyn, huh? I understand.

1200
01:14:52,104 --> 01:14:53,799
- Guns don't scare me.
- They don't scare you?

1201
01:14:53,872 --> 01:14:55,305
- Brave, too, huh?
- Yeah.

1202
01:14:55,374 --> 01:14:58,673
So the guys that had the guns,
do you remember them saying anything?

1203
01:14:58,944 --> 01:15:00,809
- Yeah.
- What'd they say?

1204
01:15:00,913 --> 01:15:02,403
They asked me about my game.

1205
01:15:02,481 --> 01:15:05,075
- Who did?
- The guy that robbed the bank. Duh.

1206
01:15:05,817 --> 01:15:07,546
Son, be respectful.

1207
01:15:07,619 --> 01:15:10,383
Okay, Brooklyn.
But it... Was he the one in charge?

1208
01:15:10,455 --> 01:15:11,547
- Uh-huh.
- Okay.

1209
01:15:11,823 --> 01:15:14,451
And you don't remember anything else?

1210
01:15:14,626 --> 01:15:16,150
He was kind of tall.

1211
01:15:16,962 --> 01:15:18,156
He had a mask.

1212
01:15:18,230 --> 01:15:22,189
Brian, you think you can recognize him
in any of these pictures?

1213
01:15:23,168 --> 01:15:25,466
Take your time. Have a good look.

1214
01:15:26,004 --> 01:15:28,700
Let's keep that over there. Just take a look.

1215
01:15:35,213 --> 01:15:38,444
- With the mask, they look all the same.
- It's true.

1216
01:15:40,185 --> 01:15:43,154
With the mask, they all look the same.
That's right, Brian.

1217
01:15:43,221 --> 01:15:46,588
Attempted robbery. Liquor store.

1218
01:15:46,858 --> 01:15:50,259
Well, this was a real step up
for a small-timer like you, huh?

1219
01:15:51,029 --> 01:15:52,860
I got to hand it to you, Pablo.

1220
01:15:52,931 --> 01:15:56,492
First of all, it's Paul. Not Pablo, okay?

1221
01:15:56,702 --> 01:15:57,794
Excuse me.

1222
01:15:58,971 --> 01:16:00,802
- You want some gum?
- No.

1223
01:16:01,607 --> 01:16:03,234
And second, I didn't do it, all right?

1224
01:16:03,308 --> 01:16:05,833
What? I made a few mistakes
when I was a kid.

1225
01:16:05,911 --> 01:16:09,210
I was out with some friends
and they held up a liquor store.

1226
01:16:10,315 --> 01:16:12,146
What was I supposed to do?

1227
01:16:13,919 --> 01:16:16,080

Park Avenue?

want to know who they are.

do you know anything about diamonds?

A bit. What do you need?

1242
01:16:45,017 --> 01:16:47,315
What do you think a guy like me
should pay for a diamond ring?

1243
01:16:47,386 --> 01:16:49,354
Depends. How many carats?

1244

If you'd like, I could give you
my nephew's number.

1245

- Okay.
- You'll get a very good deal.

I'm saying that he wants
to give us more time. He makes demands.

1274

He gives us deadlines. We stall.
Then he gives us more time.

1310
01:22:07,505 --> 01:22:11,441
The easy way, we walk out the front door
together, or the hard boys cut the power,

1311
01:22:11,509 --> 01:22:14,376
hit you with the tear gas,
and come in strong through the glass.

1312
01:22:14,446 --> 01:22:17,415
It's your choice. You don't want that.
I don't want that.

1313
01:22:17,482 --> 01:22:19,712
And, you know, they'd like to do it tonight.

1314
01:22:19,784 --> 01:22:21,615
You got night vision?

1315
01:22:22,120 --> 01:22:24,782
- You got gas masks?
- Maybe.

1316
01:22:25,991 --> 01:22:28,516
- I'm this close to ordering it.
- Let's cut the crap.

1317
01:22:28,593 --> 01:22:31,585
First, you don't order an assault
when no hostages have been killed

1318
01:22:31,663 --> 01:22:33,187
and there's no immediate threat.

1319
01:22:33,264 --> 01:22:36,324
Second, if it ends that way,
whatever happens,

1320
01:22:36,401 --> 01:22:38,096
you don't get to be the hero.

1321
01:22:38,169 --> 01:22:40,364
You want to bullshit me, try harder.

1322
01:22:41,139 --> 01:22:42,299
Let's go.

1323
01:22:44,242 --> 01:22:45,402
Okay.

1324
01:22:52,917 --> 01:22:55,886
I tell you what. My ass is covered, sport.

1325
01:22:55,954 --> 01:22:58,582
But I would not get too comfortable
in here if I were you.

1326
01:22:58,656 --> 01:23:01,318
No? I got the cable guy
coming on Wednesday.

1327
01:23:01,960 --> 01:23:04,656
- Why don't you just walk out the door?
- I will.

1328
01:23:06,431 --> 01:23:09,559
I'm gonna walk out of that door
when I'm good and ready.

1329
01:23:09,868 --> 01:23:11,859
Can I get you to do that today?

1330
01:23:13,638 --> 01:23:14,969
I didn't think so.

1331
01:23:15,040 --> 01:23:16,337
Any other proposals?

1332
01:23:16,408 --> 01:23:18,638
Oh, please. Do not say "proposals."

1333
01:23:18,710 --> 01:23:21,474
My girlfriend, she wants a proposal from me.

1334
01:23:21,546 --> 01:23:25,243
- You think you're too young to get married?
- No, I'm not too young. Too broke.

1335
01:23:25,316 --> 01:23:27,546
Maybe I should rob a bank.

1336
01:23:28,620 --> 01:23:30,315
You love each other?

1337
01:23:30,855 --> 01:23:32,686
Yeah. Yeah, we do.

1338
01:23:32,824 --> 01:23:34,985
Then money shouldn't really matter.

1339
01:23:35,560 --> 01:23:37,187
Thank you, bank robber.

1340
01:23:37,595 --> 01:23:40,826
I'm just saying money can't buy love.

1341
01:23:42,600 --> 01:23:45,262
Thank you very much. I'm...

1342
01:23:46,671 --> 01:23:48,935
I'm learning so much today, you know?

1343
01:23:49,674 --> 01:23:52,507
Look, why don't we go across
the street to the Killarney Rose, huh?

1344
01:23:52,577 --> 01:23:54,442
Forget about
this dangerous hostage situation.

1345
01:23:54,512 --> 01:23:57,037
- I'll buy you a beer. My treat.
- Thanks, Detective,

1346
01:23:57,115 --> 01:24:00,243
but I'm trying to stay away from bars,
if you know what I mean.

1347
01:24:00,318 --> 01:24:03,810
Well, if you change your mind
there's still a standing offer, all right?

1348
01:24:09,594 --> 01:24:11,789
Cellblock or the graveyard?

1349
01:24:11,863 --> 01:24:13,660
Prison whites or a toe tag?

1350
01:24:13,731 --> 01:24:17,189
- Make up your mind. Tick tock, tick tock.
- Hey! Hey!

1351
01:24:18,136 --> 01:24:19,398
We done?

1352
01:24:22,173 --> 01:24:24,300
You just crossed the fucking line!

1353
01:24:26,077 --> 01:24:28,272
Buses, Kojak, parked outside.

1354
01:24:28,813 --> 01:24:30,440
You think I'm bluffing?

1355
01:24:31,616 --> 01:24:33,982
You roll the dice and see what happens.

1356
01:24:42,961 --> 01:24:44,952
COP: All right. Now get the bunker up.

1357
01:24:45,029 --> 01:24:47,054
- So, what's up?
- Got him right where I want him.

1358
01:24:47,132 --> 01:24:48,292
Yeah? Where's that?

1359
01:24:48,366 --> 01:24:51,824
Right behind me with my pants
around my ankles, but it's a start.

1360
01:24:51,903 --> 01:24:53,336
Jesus Christ.

1361
01:25:08,119 --> 01:25:09,450
- What the fuck, man?
- How long?

1362
01:25:09,521 --> 01:25:10,988
- He got the drop on you!
- Two.

1363
01:25:11,055 --> 01:25:12,454
- How long?
- What if he saw your face?

1364
01:25:12,524 --> 01:25:13,889
- Two.
- What if I didn't have my gun?

1365
01:25:13,958 --> 01:25:15,721
Two, maybe three hours.

1366
01:25:15,793 --> 01:25:19,126
You know, you're letting this cop
get too fucking close.

1367
01:25:22,066 --> 01:25:23,260
What happened?

1368
01:25:23,334 --> 01:25:25,325
I gave him every excuse
to blow my brains out.

1369
01:25:25,403 --> 01:25:26,392
Yeah.

1370
01:25:26,471 --> 01:25:29,634
He doesn't bite. Why? He ain't the type.

1371
01:25:29,707 --> 01:25:32,198
Let's just step back
and think about this for a second.

1372
01:25:32,277 --> 01:25:35,804
We know that they planned this whole thing.
The tape, the cameras, the costumes.

1373
01:25:35,880 --> 01:25:38,212
There was a game plan,
but it never included airplanes.

1374
01:25:38,283 --> 01:25:40,945
He's up to something but it ain't violence.

DALTON: How's the reception?

1377
01:25:47,926 --> 01:25:50,326
- Excuse me?
- The camera on the truck.

1378
01:25:50,762 --> 01:25:53,390
Give me a close-up
on the second-floor window.

1379
01:25:54,098 --> 01:25:56,032
- Rourke?
- I'm on it, I'm on it.

1380
01:26:07,579 --> 01:26:10,070
No, no, no, no, no, no! Fuck!

1381
01:26:10,148 --> 01:26:11,479
Oh, shit.

What are you doing?
What the fuck are you doing?

1385
01:26:26,631 --> 01:26:28,724
You mean beyond the obvious?

1386
01:26:28,900 --> 01:26:31,368
That's what I mean.
Come on, this ain't no bank robbery!

1387
01:26:31,436 --> 01:26:34,337
This is your fault.
I told you to get the buses.

1388
01:26:34,405 --> 01:26:37,841
Fuck you! I didn't kill anybody.

1389
01:26:39,944 --> 01:26:42,640
I got 50 more people in here.
You fuck with me again,

1390

I'll give you two
of the longest days of your life.

1391
01:26:44,949 --> 01:26:49,249
All right, look, just tell me what
it is you really want and I'll get it for you.

1392
01:26:49,320 --> 01:26:52,153
- I promise.
- I've told you. Two buses, a plane.

1393
01:26:52,223 --> 01:26:54,953
Right, right. And box seats
behind home plate at Yankee Stadium.

1394
01:26:55,026 --> 01:26:57,290
Come on, don't bullshit a bullshitter.

1395
01:26:57,962 --> 01:27:00,396
You planned every inch of this thing
right from the start.

1396
01:27:00,465 --> 01:27:04,265
You got everybody marching to your beat,
including me, and I'm through buying it.

1397
01:27:07,438 --> 01:27:09,633
You're too damn smart to be a cop.

1398
01:27:09,707 --> 01:27:11,470
Now get the fuck out of here.

1399
01:27:11,542 --> 01:27:13,203
What? You going to shoot me?

1400
01:27:14,078 --> 01:27:15,636
Do it. Shit, you got nothing to lose.

1401
01:27:15,713 --> 01:27:18,011
I damn sure ain't got nothing to lose,
so shoot me.

1402
01:27:18,416 --> 01:27:19,576
Do it.

1403
01:27:19,951 --> 01:27:21,976
- Shoot me.
- Fuck you.

01:27:22,687 --> 01:27:25,178
Tell them to send someone sane over here.

1405
01:27:54,118 --> 01:27:55,608
We got a big problem.

1406
01:27:55,687 --> 01:27:57,780
Hey, Detective, this ain't your day.

1407
01:28:04,562 --> 01:28:06,223
How you doing, Captain?

1408
01:28:08,099 --> 01:28:10,158
Look, I know you
put your trust in me and I just...

1409
01:28:10,234 --> 01:28:13,032
Well, you're a good cop.
Frazier, I need more like you.

1410
01:28:13,104 --> 01:28:15,436
But if you're going down on this one,
I can't go with you.

1411
01:28:15,506 --> 01:28:17,098
You got to understand this, though, sir...

1412
01:28:17,175 --> 01:28:19,370
No, no, no. Let me just tell you
what my problem is, okay?

1413
01:28:19,444 --> 01:28:21,412
I go to bed, everything's hunky-dory.

1414
01:28:21,479 --> 01:28:23,879
I get a call at 3:15, and there's what?
A dead hostage.

1415
01:28:23,948 --> 01:28:26,746
- Right, right, right. But I can end this...
- It is ended.

1416
01:28:27,185 --> 01:28:29,119
See, you think I got options.

1417
01:28:29,187 --> 01:28:31,485
I got to answer to the Chief of D's.

01:28:53,177 --> 01:28:55,202
- What'd he say?
- That's it.

Shit.

DARIUS: It's a tactical nightmare.
COUGHLIN: I know.

1423
01:29:01,953 --> 01:29:05,013
Well, first, this is the only way in.

1424
01:29:05,089 --> 01:29:07,353
Then we got to make it up the stairs blind.

1425
01:29:07,425 --> 01:29:09,723
Once we get up there,
we're right out in the open.

1426
01:29:09,794 --> 01:29:13,787
DARIUS: They have the advantage of cover.
They can pick us off like sitting ducks.

1427
01:29:14,365 --> 01:29:17,960
Then if we make it across the floor
and down the stairs,

1428
01:29:18,035 --> 01:29:21,471
we still can't tell the homies
from the good guys until they shoot at us.

1429
01:29:21,539 --> 01:29:24,633
Even if it isn't rigged with explosives,
it's still a fucking nightmare.

is to separate them from the hostages.

and take them out?

1440

Maybe we should dress our guys up
like a bunch of painters.

1445
01:30:36,214 --> 01:30:40,150
And we should use rubber bullets.
Take head shots. Put their lights out.

COUGHLIN: Yeah.

- I'm making First Grade.
- What?

01:30:58,236 --> 01:31:01,535
I'm making Detective First Grade.
Things ain't all they appear to be.

1452
01:31:01,606 --> 01:31:05,667
- What the fuck does that mean?
- Detective First Grade Keith Frazier.

- Are you fucking kidding me?
- Yes.

Thank the Mayor
and our mystery guest for that.

You cut a deal with those guys?

Never make First Grade? Shit.

1457
01:31:16,921 --> 01:31:18,786
Worked too hard to let that happen.

1461
01:31:32,503 --> 01:31:36,269
Detective, they're gonna storm that bank
without you? It's not right.

1462
01:31:37,375 --> 01:31:40,776
So, tell me about the kid
who pointed the gun at you, the 12-year-old.

1463
01:31:40,845 --> 01:31:42,472
- Now?
- Yeah.

1464
01:31:43,180 --> 01:31:44,943
Last year, up in the 33rd,

1465
01:31:45,016 --> 01:31:47,849
I was breaking up a fight
about a half a block from the high school.

1466
01:31:47,919 --> 01:31:50,649
This one little spic is getting
his clock cleaned by another one.

1467
01:31:50,721 --> 01:31:54,088
Do me a favor, Sergeant.
Just tone down the color commentary.

1468
01:31:56,060 --> 01:31:58,324
So I bust up the fight,

1469
01:31:58,396 --> 01:32:02,093
I turn around

- Another kid, an African-American.

- Yeah.

1472
01:32:07,939 --> 01:32:09,497
Came out of nowhere. I didn't see him.

1473

So, what'd you do?

What did I do then?
I'll tell you what I did then.

I got shot in the fucking chest.
That's what I did then.

Yeah, so you'll pardon
my euphemisms, Detective,

1477
01:32:18,716 --> 01:32:22,311
but I would rather wind up an old bigot
than a handsome young corpse.

1478

Now, no offense, Detective,

1479
01:32:24,088 --> 01:32:26,556

to keep them away from us.

1480
01:32:26,624 --> 01:32:29,855
Now, what do you say we just
get these people safely out of the bank?

01:42:28,125 --> 01:42:30,787
Even if we considered someone
as a possible suspect,

1636
01:42:30,894 --> 01:42:33,624
there's one or two or three other people
that would rule them out.

1637
01:42:33,697 --> 01:42:35,096
It's like the thing never happened.

1638
01:42:35,165 --> 01:42:37,963
- What about prints?
- Everywhere. So what?

1639
01:42:38,835 --> 01:42:42,362
- All it shows is that these people were there.
- Alibis?

1640
01:42:42,439 --> 01:42:43,804
Just about everyone.

1641
01:42:43,874 --> 01:42:45,774
Even if their alibi was weak,

1642
01:42:45,842 --> 01:42:48,902
a hostage would identify them
as being one of the good guys.

1643
01:42:48,979 --> 01:42:50,537
There we are, back to square one.

1644
01:42:50,614 --> 01:42:51,638
Priors?

1645
01:42:51,715 --> 01:42:55,207
We got one employee who had
some juvie stuff. One customer had...

1646
01:42:55,285 --> 01:42:56,445
Excuse me.

1647
01:42:57,154 --> 01:42:59,816
One customer had an out-of-state warrant
for child support.

1648
01:42:59,890 --> 01:43:02,620
Another one had a couple of priors,
G.L.A. Mostly.

1649
01:43:03,660 --> 01:43:06,629
Again, same problem.
Plus, he was a fucking idiot.

1650
01:43:06,697 --> 01:43:08,722
- Bank cameras?
- Useless.

1651
01:43:08,799 --> 01:43:11,233
I'm telling you,
they thought of everything. Almost.

1652
01:43:11,301 --> 01:43:13,633
- Sounded like everything to me.
- But this.

1653
01:43:13,704 --> 01:43:16,969
We haven't found that.357
or the perp that was holding it.

1654
01:43:17,040 --> 01:43:19,736
If you did, there'd be no prints on it anyway.

1655
01:43:20,544 --> 01:43:22,068
- Bury it.
- Bury it?

1656
01:43:22,312 --> 01:43:24,610
What the fuck do you expect me to say?

1657
01:43:28,652 --> 01:43:32,053
Captain, this thing stinks to high hell.
I mean, somebody did something here.

1658
01:43:32,122 --> 01:43:33,680
You said it yourself.

1659
01:43:33,757 --> 01:43:36,351
You got no robbery. No suspects.

1660
01:43:36,893 --> 01:43:39,225
Nobody's breathing down my neck
to come up with answers.

1661
01:43:39,296 --> 01:43:41,764
I'm not gonna breathe down yours. Bury it.

1662
01:43:45,369 --> 01:43:47,200
I wasn't expecting this.

1663
01:43:47,271 --> 01:43:50,297
I promise you,
I'll find you guys more cases to solve.

1664
01:43:52,809 --> 01:43:53,901
Okay.

1665
01:43:55,679 --> 01:43:58,546
Oh, here's something
that you probably did expect.

1666
01:43:58,615 --> 01:44:02,312
- They found that missing Madrugada money.
- No shit.

1667
01:44:02,919 --> 01:44:05,114
Yes, you want to know where it was?

1668
01:44:05,188 --> 01:44:07,383
- In my bank account?
- No.

1669
01:44:07,457 --> 01:44:09,789
- My summer house in Sag Harbor?
- No.

1670
01:44:09,860 --> 01:44:11,555
- My wallet?
- No.

1671
01:44:12,462 --> 01:44:15,192
Then, no. I don't want to know.

1672
01:44:23,006 --> 01:44:24,735
MITCHELL: This is bullshit, man.

1673
01:44:24,808 --> 01:44:27,072
I mean, we're the only ones left
trying to catch the bad guys

1674
01:44:27,144 --> 01:44:28,805
and they're gonna come after us like that?

1675
01:44:28,879 --> 01:44:30,904
I'll tell you what.
Every one of your accusers, man,

1676
01:44:30,981 --> 01:44:34,417
I say we go after them all, Keith,
Michael Corleone style.

1677
01:44:34,484 --> 01:44:36,509
"Michael Corleone,
do you renounce Satan?"

1678
01:44:36,586 --> 01:44:38,213
"Yes, I renounce him."

1679
01:44:39,389 --> 01:44:41,414
FRAZIER: There's no 392.

1680
01:44:41,491 --> 01:44:44,460
- Huh?
- Safety deposit box number 392.

1681
01:44:44,528 --> 01:44:46,792
According to these records, it doesn't exist.

1682
01:44:46,863 --> 01:44:49,297
Pinstriped, mayonnaise, lying motherfucker.

1683
01:44:49,633 --> 01:44:52,830
- Didn't Coughlin say we should move on?
- Let's go.

1684
01:45:02,245 --> 01:45:04,543
Thank you, again, Your Honor.
I'll come pick it up tomorrow?

1685
01:45:04,614 --> 01:45:06,639
- Yes, you're welcome.
- Thank you.

1686
01:45:13,523 --> 01:45:15,013
What are you doing, Detective?

1687
01:45:15,092 --> 01:45:17,652
Now, what business do you have
with Judge Pasqua?

1688
01:45:17,728 --> 01:45:19,218
Police business.

1689
01:45:19,296 --> 01:45:22,697
- Weren't you told to bury this?
- I got a job to do, Miss White.

1690
01:45:22,766 --> 01:45:25,599
And since when is your job
more important than your career?

1691
01:45:25,669 --> 01:45:28,103
- Or did you forget our arrangement?
- We didn't have any arrangement.

1692
01:45:28,171 --> 01:45:29,604
Let me tell you how this works. You...

1693
01:45:29,673 --> 01:45:31,698
No, let me tell you how this works.

1694
01:45:31,775 --> 01:45:35,006
You press here to record
and you press here to play.

1695
01:45:35,078 --> 01:45:37,444
MADELEINE: (OVER RECORDER) There's
also the matter of the $140,000

1696
01:45:37,514 --> 01:45:38,674
that seems to have walked away

1697
01:45:38,749 --> 01:45:41,513
from the Madrugada check-cashing bust.

1698
01:45:41,685 --> 01:45:43,949
FRAZIER: I didn't have anything
to do with that, so...

1699
01:45:44,020 --> 01:45:46,079
MAYOR: We'd like to be
in your corner on that.

1700
01:45:46,156 --> 01:45:49,023
In exchange for what? I mean, what,
do you want me to do something unethical?

1701
01:45:49,092 --> 01:45:51,060
I mean, no disrespect to the both of youse

1702
01:45:51,128 --> 01:45:53,187
but I don't need you
to be in my corner, Mr. Mayor.

1703
01:45:53,263 --> 01:45:54,594
Look, I'm innocent.

1704
01:45:54,664 --> 01:45:57,462
MADELEINE: Innocent or guilty,
you're still going down.

1705
01:45:58,301 --> 01:46:02,260
MAYOR: Give Miss White whatever
she needs, or your career is over.

1706
01:46:02,739 --> 01:46:03,865
Done.

1707
01:46:04,241 --> 01:46:05,435
Kaput.

1708
01:46:06,943 --> 01:46:09,912
So? You gave me what I wanted.

1709
01:46:09,980 --> 01:46:13,108
Your career is blossoming
and all is right with the world.

1710
01:46:13,183 --> 01:46:14,707
What was Case hiding?

1711
01:46:17,888 --> 01:46:21,346
You know, there's a famous saying
by the Baron de Rothschild.

1712
01:46:23,093 --> 01:46:26,290
"When there's blood on the streets,
buy property."

1713
01:46:28,765 --> 01:46:31,791
I think Mr. Case
really took that sentiment to heart.

1714
01:46:31,868 --> 01:46:34,666
But he is no different
than half the Fortune 500.

1715
01:46:36,139 --> 01:46:37,902
Let it go, Detective.

1716
01:46:39,376 --> 01:46:40,968
You're a good cop.

1717
01:46:41,745 --> 01:46:43,474
This city needs you.

1718
01:47:11,675 --> 01:47:15,133
- Lady! Lady, you're in the wrong place.
- I have an appointment.

1719
01:47:23,753 --> 01:47:24,947
Arthur.

1720
01:47:25,755 --> 01:47:28,315
- Good morning.
- Miss White.

1721
01:47:29,125 --> 01:47:30,456
Have a seat.

1722
01:47:32,362 --> 01:47:35,160
Thank you, Vincent. That's all for now.
Thank you.

1723
01:47:35,665 --> 01:47:36,996
(CASE CLEARING THROAT)

1724
01:47:38,768 --> 01:47:40,963
Well. What did he say?

1725
01:47:41,037 --> 01:47:44,063
Well, Detective Frazier
turned out to be quite sharp.

1726
01:47:44,140 --> 01:47:47,303
But I just fast-tracked his career a little
and he's under control.

1727
01:47:47,377 --> 01:47:50,346
I hope so. Tell me about the envelope.

1728
01:47:50,780 --> 01:47:51,940
Where is it now?

1729
01:47:52,015 --> 01:47:54,916
Well, the gang leader
is going to hang on to it,

1730
01:47:54,985 --> 01:47:58,113
as an insurance policy
to keep you from seeking revenge.

1731
01:47:58,788 --> 01:48:01,552
Clearly, he has a very low opinion of you.

1732
01:48:01,625 --> 01:48:02,956
And what might that be?

1733
01:48:03,026 --> 01:48:06,325
Well, let's see.
In a nutshell, that you got rich,

1734
01:48:06,530 --> 01:48:09,624
doing business with the Nazis
during the Holocaust.

1735
01:48:12,903 --> 01:48:13,995
Yes.

1736
01:48:15,205 --> 01:48:18,299
It was 60 years ago.
I was young and ambitious.

1737
01:48:18,942 --> 01:48:21,740
I saw a short path to success and I took it.

1738
01:48:23,346 --> 01:48:24,870
I sold my soul.

1739
01:48:26,650 --> 01:48:29,642
And I've been trying to buy it back
ever since.

1740
01:48:29,719 --> 01:48:34,213
But you and this mystery man,
you have an understanding?

1741
01:48:34,391 --> 01:48:38,225
I think so. And he managed
to get out of there with that envelope.

1742
01:48:39,262 --> 01:48:42,595
If someday
he comes back to blackmail you, well,

1743
01:48:43,433 --> 01:48:46,129
you'll pay him. And you'll get it back.

1744
01:48:47,404 --> 01:48:49,463
- So, I guess that's it.
- I suppose so.

1745
01:48:49,539 --> 01:48:51,439
- Bullshit.
- I beg your pardon?

1746
01:48:51,508 --> 01:48:55,376
He didn't go through all that just to stick
your envelope under his mattress.

1747
01:48:55,445 --> 01:48:58,278
Look, they left money untouched, Arthur.

1748
01:48:58,348 --> 01:48:59,406
So?

1749
01:48:59,549 --> 01:49:03,952
So, he had to have walked out of there
with something else.

1750
01:49:04,921 --> 01:49:07,412
The bank says
that there was nothing missing.

1751
01:49:07,490 --> 01:49:10,084
So, there had to have been
something in that box

1752
01:49:10,160 --> 01:49:12,788
that was worth more to him
than your envelope.

1753
01:49:14,798 --> 01:49:16,789
You don't have to tell me.

1754
01:49:16,866 --> 01:49:19,266
There's only one thing it could be anyway.

1755
01:49:22,639 --> 01:49:23,799
Diamonds.

1756
01:49:24,741 --> 01:49:26,606
And then there's the ring.

1757
01:49:27,310 --> 01:49:28,709
Cartier ring.

1758
01:49:29,346 --> 01:49:32,315
It belonged to the wife of a Parisian banker.

1759
01:49:32,716 --> 01:49:35,378
Wealthy family of French Jews.

1760
01:49:36,052 --> 01:49:39,180
And when the war came along,
the ring and everything else they owned

1761
01:49:39,255 --> 01:49:44,090
was confiscated and they were shipped off
to concentration camps. None survived.

1762
01:49:46,096 --> 01:49:47,723
We were friends.

1763
01:49:48,632 --> 01:49:50,429
I could have helped them.

1764
01:49:52,369 --> 01:49:57,170
But the Nazis paid too well.

1765
01:49:59,109 --> 01:50:03,671
Can I trust that you will keep
what you've learned

1766
01:50:03,747 --> 01:50:07,080
here today confidential?

1767
01:50:08,151 --> 01:50:10,449
Despite whatever you may think?

1768
01:50:19,562 --> 01:50:20,961
Yes, Arthur.

1769
01:50:22,932 --> 01:50:26,095
Well, I'd love to tell you
what a monster you are,

1770
01:50:26,302 --> 01:50:30,466
but I have to help bin Laden's nephew
buy a co-op on Park Avenue.

1771
01:50:34,678 --> 01:50:37,146
If that were true, you wouldn't tell me.

1772
01:50:37,447 --> 01:50:39,608
We're listing you as a reference.

1773
01:50:52,929 --> 01:50:53,953
(SIGHING)

1774
01:50:54,097 --> 01:50:56,429
My name is Dalton Russell.

1775
01:50:57,000 --> 01:50:58,831
Pay strict attention to what I say

1776
01:50:58,902 --> 01:51:02,531
because I choose my words carefully
and I never repeat myself.

1777
01:51:02,605 --> 01:51:05,335
I've told you my name. That's the "who."

1778
01:51:06,376 --> 01:51:10,039
The "where" could most readily
be described as a prison cell.

1779
01:51:10,580 --> 01:51:12,172
But there is a vast difference

1780
01:51:12,248 --> 01:51:15,775
between being stuck in a tiny cell
and being in prison.

1781
01:51:17,487 --> 01:51:19,079
The "what" is easy.

1782
01:51:20,123 --> 01:51:24,822
Recently I planned and set in motion
events to execute the perfect bank robbery.

1783
01:51:25,862 --> 01:51:27,762
That's also the "when."

1784
01:51:28,798 --> 01:51:33,167
As for the "why,"
beyond the obvious financial motivation,

1785
01:51:33,903 --> 01:51:35,666
it's exceedingly simple.

1786
01:51:36,072 --> 01:51:37,505
Because I can.

1787
01:51:38,608 --> 01:51:40,769
Which leaves us only with the "how."

1788
01:51:41,678 --> 01:51:44,704
And therein, as the Bard would tell us,

1789
01:51:45,782 --> 01:51:47,249
lies the rub.

1790
01:51:55,525 --> 01:51:56,514
(BANGING)

1791
01:52:36,466 --> 01:52:40,061
STEVE: He's gonna smell like shit.
STEVE-O: What do you expect after a week?

1792
01:52:42,438 --> 01:52:43,530
CHAIM: Yeah.

1793
01:52:43,973 --> 01:52:46,441
Why do you think I rolled down the window?

1794
01:52:49,479 --> 01:52:50,537
(CHUCKLING)

1795
01:53:06,129 --> 01:53:07,391
Oh, shit.

1796
01:53:12,836 --> 01:53:15,396
That cop, Frazier, and his partner
are walking into the bank.

1797
01:53:15,471 --> 01:53:18,770
- Are they coming for me?
- Can't say. It's just the two of them.

1798
01:53:26,416 --> 01:53:29,385
MAN: Yeah, everything's going great today.
No.

1799
01:53:29,752 --> 01:53:32,721
Yeah, about 5:30. Okay.

1800
01:53:33,189 --> 01:53:35,714
Sounds like fun. Okay.

1801
01:53:36,526 --> 01:53:38,050
Talk to you later.

1802
01:53:59,449 --> 01:54:01,212
- Sorry.
- Excuse me.

1803
01:54:04,520 --> 01:54:05,919
Mr. Hammond?

1804
01:54:05,989 --> 01:54:07,752
Good morning, Detectives.

1805
01:54:11,327 --> 01:54:12,885
Just like he planned.

1806
01:54:12,962 --> 01:54:15,556
I got a court order here
to open a safe deposit box.

1807
01:54:15,632 --> 01:54:17,566
Number 392.

1808
01:54:25,742 --> 01:54:26,834
(STEVE-O SIGHING)

1809
01:54:28,778 --> 01:54:30,541
STEVE-O: Oh, thank God.

1810
01:54:36,286 --> 01:54:37,685
Where is it?

1811
01:54:38,454 --> 01:54:39,921
I left it in there.

1812
01:54:39,989 --> 01:54:41,684
This way, Detectives.

1813
01:54:41,758 --> 01:54:44,352
Why did you do that? You left the ring.

1814
01:54:44,427 --> 01:54:45,689
Trust me.

1815
01:54:46,629 --> 01:54:48,290
I left it in good hands.

1816
01:54:49,198 --> 01:54:50,790
DALTON: I'm no martyr.

1817
01:54:51,501 --> 01:54:53,128
I did it for the money.

1818
01:54:54,938 --> 01:54:58,465
But it's not worth much
if you can't face yourself in the mirror.

1819
01:54:59,409 --> 01:55:02,037
Respect is the ultimate currency.

1820
01:55:04,881 --> 01:55:08,817
I was stealing from a man
who traded his away for a few dollars.

1821
01:55:10,720 --> 01:55:13,188
And then he tried to wash away his guilt.

1822
01:55:14,324 --> 01:55:18,351
Drown it in a lifetime of good deeds
and a sea of respectability.

1823
01:55:19,162 --> 01:55:21,289
- Let me get that.
- Let me.

1824
01:55:21,364 --> 01:55:22,763
It almost worked, too.

1825
01:55:22,832 --> 01:55:23,958
Okay.

1826
01:55:26,035 --> 01:55:27,434
But inevitably,

1827
01:55:28,371 --> 01:55:30,566
the further you run from your sins,

1828
01:55:31,374 --> 01:55:34,343
the more exhausted you are
when they catch up to you.

1829
01:55:34,677 --> 01:55:35,837
And they do.

1830
01:55:37,747 --> 01:55:39,271
Son of a bitch.

1831
01:55:39,349 --> 01:55:40,543
Certain.

1832
01:55:41,551 --> 01:55:43,212
It will not fail.

1833
01:55:47,623 --> 01:55:49,614
FRAZIER: What do you think that's worth?

1834
01:55:49,892 --> 01:55:52,554
(CHUCKLING) If you got to ask, man,
you can't afford it.

1835
01:55:52,628 --> 01:55:55,028
Thank goodness my girlfriend ain't here.

1836
01:55:57,133 --> 01:55:58,930
"Follow the ring"?

1837
01:56:12,982 --> 01:56:15,917
- Detective Frazier.
- Mr. Case.

1838
01:56:16,119 --> 01:56:18,087
- How are you?
- I am great.

1839
01:56:18,521 --> 01:56:21,922
Nobody got killed at the bank.
Everybody's happy. My kind of day.

1840
01:56:21,991 --> 01:56:23,982
That's wonderful. Wonderful.

1841
01:56:24,060 --> 01:56:25,789
- Detective Mitchell.
- Mr. Case.

1842
01:56:25,862 --> 01:56:27,830
- Be seated, gentlemen.
- Thank you.

1843
01:56:27,897 --> 01:56:30,195
- Can I offer you anything?
- No.

1844
01:56:30,266 --> 01:56:31,858
I must say

1845
01:56:32,235 --> 01:56:34,669
I was most impressed

1846
01:56:35,838 --> 01:56:37,738
by the way you handled that business.

1847
01:56:37,807 --> 01:56:39,138
Thank you, Mr. Case.

1848
01:56:39,208 --> 01:56:41,142
Whenever I hear the term
"New York's Finest"

1849
01:56:41,210 --> 01:56:42,939
you're who I think of.

1850
01:56:43,012 --> 01:56:46,277
You keep the rest of us safe
and make it look easy.

1851
01:56:48,584 --> 01:56:50,950
- Pardon me.
- Well, what's so amusing?

1852
01:56:51,020 --> 01:56:53,989
When you say "the rest of us," Mr. Case,
I mean, you got to look around.

1853
01:56:54,057 --> 01:56:58,118
"The rest of us" is a category
that you haven't qualified for in a long time.

1854
01:56:58,194 --> 01:57:00,924
Touch, Detective.
I won't deny it. I've done well.

1855
01:57:00,997 --> 01:57:03,158
Yes, you have. But I'm very confused.

1856
01:57:03,232 --> 01:57:04,995
You see, I got a case

1857
01:57:05,735 --> 01:57:08,704
where armed robbers
laid siege to your bank.

1858
01:57:08,771 --> 01:57:10,102
It is your bank, right?

1859
01:57:10,173 --> 01:57:12,073
Well, I'm Chairman of the Board of Directors.

1860
01:57:12,141 --> 01:57:13,836
Then ita-zita-vene-gazoo.

1861
01:57:13,910 --> 01:57:15,844
The robbers disappear. Poof.

1862
01:57:16,179 --> 01:57:17,578
And they don't take a nickel, right?

1863
01:57:17,647 --> 01:57:19,979
- You're asking me?
- Yes, I'm asking you.

1864
01:57:20,049 --> 01:57:22,244
I mean, it's your bank. You own it.
I'm asking you.

1865
01:57:22,318 --> 01:57:24,218
It's a tiny part of our organization.

1866
01:57:24,287 --> 01:57:26,414
No robbers. No real victims.
No loot missing.

1867
01:57:26,489 --> 01:57:28,582
It's got to be the first time
in law-enforcement history.

1868
01:57:28,658 --> 01:57:29,818
I never heard of it before.

1869
01:57:29,892 --> 01:57:32,952
So, you got to ask yourself, "What the fuck
happened?" Don't you, Mr. Case?

1870
01:57:33,029 --> 01:57:34,656
I'm not quite sure I like your tone, Officer.

1871
01:57:34,730 --> 01:57:37,096
You don't like my tone?
Then give me a straight answer.

1872
01:57:37,166 --> 01:57:41,000
It's the founding bank of your empire.
You built it. It's your baby.

1873
01:57:41,070 --> 01:57:43,129
Give me a straight answer.
What do you think happened?

1874
01:57:43,206 --> 01:57:46,835
- I have no idea.
- Oh, come on, now. Come on.

1875
01:57:46,909 --> 01:57:48,342
I'll tell you what I think happened.

1876
01:57:48,411 --> 01:57:50,572
I think you sent that woman in there
to patch things up.

1877
01:57:50,646 --> 01:57:53,171
Miss White. I think you paid her.
What was she doing in there?

1878
01:57:53,249 --> 01:57:54,739
Look, this is absurd.

1879
01:57:54,817 --> 01:57:56,785
Are you implying that
I had anything to do with it?

1880
01:57:56,853 --> 01:57:58,480
392.

1881
01:57:59,021 --> 01:58:01,512
Safe deposit box 392.
What's the story on that?

1882
01:58:01,591 --> 01:58:03,991
- I have no idea what you're...
- Don't lie to me, Mr. Case.

1883
01:58:04,060 --> 01:58:06,551
- I don't lie.
- I looked at all the records.

1884
01:58:06,629 --> 01:58:10,190
All the bank records
for safe deposit boxes at your bank.

1885
01:58:10,366 --> 01:58:13,062
At first glance, everything looked fine,

1886
01:58:13,836 --> 01:58:16,168
but there was one safe deposit box
that had no records.

1887
01:58:16,239 --> 01:58:18,207
I mean, going all the way back to 1948.

1888
01:58:18,274 --> 01:58:21,437
So I started thinking.
Who would have the answer to this riddle?

1889
01:58:21,511 --> 01:58:23,376
Probably the man who forgot to mention

1890
01:58:23,446 --> 01:58:25,778
that he built the bank
in the first place in 1948.

1891
01:58:25,848 --> 01:58:28,578
It doesn't add up, Mr. Case.
It does not add up.

1892
01:58:29,619 --> 01:58:33,953
I'm afraid I can't be
of any further use to you, Detective.

1893
01:58:35,091 --> 01:58:37,616
It's something really bad, isn't it?

1894
01:58:38,327 --> 01:58:42,957
Mr. Frazier, I have spent
my whole life serving humanity.

1895
01:58:44,400 --> 01:58:46,459
You can ask anyone who knows me.

1896
01:58:47,737 --> 01:58:50,729
They'll vouch for me,
and for the things that I've done.

1897
01:58:50,806 --> 01:58:53,866
You think they'll vouch for you
after I find out the truth about this ring?

1898
01:58:53,943 --> 01:58:55,342
I don't think so.

1899
01:59:00,016 --> 01:59:03,042
Oh, by the way, that thing you said
about us being New York's finest?

1900
01:59:03,119 --> 01:59:05,747
I want you to know,
we really appreciate that.

1901
01:59:06,389 --> 01:59:07,720
How gracious.

1902
01:59:08,558 --> 01:59:11,220
Let's go. We're gonna follow that ring.

1903
01:59:18,234 --> 01:59:20,794
- Hey, Keith, let me see your shoe.
- What?

1904
01:59:20,870 --> 01:59:23,270
- Let me see your shoe.
- Why?

1905
01:59:23,339 --> 01:59:26,570
'Cause I have never seen anybody
put their foot that far up a guy's ass.

1906
01:59:29,478 --> 01:59:31,173
Yeah, I guess I did, didn't I?

1907
01:59:31,247 --> 01:59:33,841
Oh, man. You cut him an ass
the length of the Lincoln Tunnel.

1908
01:59:33,916 --> 01:59:36,248
We're gonna need a traffic cop on that shit.

1909
01:59:45,161 --> 01:59:46,355
Good afternoon, sir.

1910
01:59:46,429 --> 01:59:48,329
- Do you have a reservation?
- Looking for the Mayor.

1911
01:59:48,397 --> 01:59:50,388
- May I have your hat, please?
- No, you cannot. Get your own.

1912
01:59:50,466 --> 01:59:53,060
MADELEINE: They're looking to invest
$4 billion over the next four years.

1913
01:59:53,135 --> 01:59:54,261
And that's all in place.

1914
01:59:54,370 --> 01:59:57,339
Sorry to interrupt you, Mr. Mayor,
but there's an old American saying,

1915
01:59:57,406 --> 02:00:01,172
"When there's blood on the streets,
somebody's got to go to jail."

1916
02:00:01,844 --> 02:00:04,870
Edwin, could you please excuse us
for a minute?

1917
02:00:06,949 --> 02:00:08,541
MAYOR: What's this about, Detective?

1918
02:00:08,618 --> 02:00:12,145
I believe Detective Frazier
is looking for some closure?

1919
02:00:12,488 --> 02:00:14,752
That's a good word. Closure.

1920
02:00:14,824 --> 02:00:17,418
Case closed, you know what I mean?

1921
02:00:17,493 --> 02:00:18,824
This is the number

1922
02:00:18,894 --> 02:00:22,955
of the War Crimes Issues office
in Washington, D.C.

1923
02:00:24,600 --> 02:00:27,194
How'd you like to be on the front page
of the New York Times?

1924
02:00:27,270 --> 02:00:28,396
That'd be great.

1925
02:00:28,471 --> 02:00:31,804
Make sure they spell my name right, though.
That's Frazier with a "z".

1926
02:00:32,942 --> 02:00:34,466
You can keep the pen.

1927
02:00:35,177 --> 02:00:36,667
You made copies?

1928
02:00:38,281 --> 02:00:39,475
Please.

1929
02:00:39,915 --> 02:00:43,316
We got to keep the real criminals
off the streets, Your Honor.

1930
02:00:44,787 --> 02:00:47,449
All right, well, thanks for lunch.

1931
02:00:51,827 --> 02:00:53,385
War crimes, huh?

1932
02:00:54,196 --> 02:00:56,426
What have you got me into this time?

1933
02:01:03,673 --> 02:01:04,901
(SNORING SOFTLY)

1934
02:01:16,018 --> 02:01:17,110
Mama?

1935
02:01:21,824 --> 02:01:24,554
- Did you bring Big Willie?
- And the twins.

1936
02:01:38,207 --> 02:01:39,469
Slow down, girl.

1937
02:01:39,542 --> 02:01:41,908
I'll get my gun off
before I get my gun off, okay?

1938
02:01:41,977 --> 02:01:43,239
Pow, pow.

1939
02:02:25,221 --> 02:02:26,916
- Sorry.
- Excuse me.

1940
02:02:27,656 --> 02:02:29,283
FRAZIER: Why don't you
just walk out the door?

1941
02:02:29,358 --> 02:02:30,450
DALTON: I will.

1942
02:02:30,726 --> 02:02:33,593
I'm gonna walk out of that door
when I'm good and ready.

1943
02:02:33,662 --> 02:02:34,959
Son of a bitch.

1944
02:02:42,338 --> 02:02:45,239
Come on, honey.
The handcuffs are getting cold.

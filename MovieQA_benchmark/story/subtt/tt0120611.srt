1
00:01:02,162 --> 00:01:04,926
Police found her in the street.
Looks like she was bitten.

2
00:01:05,032 --> 00:01:06,465
Some kind of an animal.

3
00:01:06,567 --> 00:01:08,398
Jesus! Her water`s broken!

4
00:01:08,502 --> 00:01:10,834
She`s going into
uterine contractions!

5
00:01:10,938 --> 00:01:12,565
We`ll have to do a C-section!

6
00:02:10,798 --> 00:02:12,231
What you got down there,
little man?

7
00:02:12,332 --> 00:02:14,027
Oh, that`s my heatseeker.

8
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:15,465
I`ll bet it is.

9
00:02:18,906 --> 00:02:20,203
So, where are we going?

10
00:02:20,307 --> 00:02:22,036
It`s a surprise, baby.

11
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:23,666
Yeah, I like surprises.

12
00:02:28,682 --> 00:02:31,947
Oh, my God!

13
00:02:32,019 --> 00:02:34,681
What the fuck are we doing here?

14
00:02:37,691 --> 00:02:38,817
Look at all that.

15
00:02:41,729 --> 00:02:43,128
What the fuck is that?

16
00:02:53,874 --> 00:02:55,637
What did you just say?

17
00:03:34,681 --> 00:03:35,613
Wow.

18
00:03:51,365 --> 00:03:52,889
What`s up?

19
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,399
Man!

20
00:04:04,812 --> 00:04:05,938
All right.

21
00:04:31,004 --> 00:04:33,029
What`s happening?

22
00:04:39,913 --> 00:04:41,744
Whoa!

23
00:04:41,849 --> 00:04:42,941
Man.

24
00:04:48,088 --> 00:04:49,146
Fuck.

25
00:05:00,267 --> 00:05:01,825
Fuck. I need a drink.

26
00:05:57,624 --> 00:05:59,455
What`s wrong, baby?

27
00:06:55,482 --> 00:06:56,813
Is that him?

28
00:06:56,917 --> 00:06:58,714
Jesus, that`s him.

29
00:06:58,785 --> 00:07:01,515
It`s Blade. It`s the daywalker.

30
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:24,775
Come on, daywalker!

31
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:48,131
I`m gonna rip
your fucking head off!

32
00:08:42,489 --> 00:08:44,889
That`s him! Get him!

33
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:46,083
Fuck him up!

34
00:08:46,226 --> 00:08:49,320
We`re gonna jack you up.
Make him hurt bad.

35
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:55,853
Quinn...

36
00:09:59,232 --> 00:10:01,063
I`m getting a little tired
of chopping you up.

37
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:09,405
Thought I might try fire
for a change.

38
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:14,376
Give my regards to Frost.

39
00:10:18,318 --> 00:10:19,444
Please don`t!

40
00:10:34,201 --> 00:10:35,600
Put him out.

41
00:10:35,702 --> 00:10:37,294
-Yes, sir.
-Paramedics.

42
00:11:00,427 --> 00:11:04,022
Got a charred cadaver for you.
Still warm, too.

43
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:05,597
1, 2, 3.

44
00:11:10,804 --> 00:11:12,795
Oh, Jesus, that`s rank.

45
00:11:14,341 --> 00:11:16,741
He was still screaming
when they found him...

46
00:11:16,843 --> 00:11:19,835
stapled to a wall.

47
00:11:19,946 --> 00:11:21,140
That`s very pretty.

48
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:36,184
Did you check the chem count?

49
00:11:36,329 --> 00:11:38,229
His blood sugar`s
3 times norm...

50
00:11:38,331 --> 00:11:40,094
phosphorus and uric acid
are off the charts.

51
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,997
You took this off a DOA?

52
00:11:46,139 --> 00:11:47,868
But this doesn`t make any sense.

53
00:11:51,645 --> 00:11:54,273
The red blood cells are
biconvex, which is impossible.

54
00:11:54,381 --> 00:11:56,349
Look at the polys,
they`re binucleated.

55
00:12:00,887 --> 00:12:04,015
Curtis,
it`s 3:00 in the morning--

56
00:12:04,157 --> 00:12:05,215
This is not a joke.

57
00:12:05,358 --> 00:12:07,223
I`ve got the body
in the morgue right now.

58
00:12:09,429 --> 00:12:11,522
I thought you promised
to give me some distance.

59
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:14,829
I just want you to come down
and take a look.

60
00:12:21,308 --> 00:12:24,971
Show me the body.

61
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:27,546
And I don`t want to hear
a word about us.

62
00:12:27,647 --> 00:12:30,241
Done.
We`ve had that conversation.

63
00:12:34,387 --> 00:12:36,355
You haven`t started
on the internal organs yet?

64
00:12:36,489 --> 00:12:38,286
Just a blood sample
for the pericardium.

65
00:12:41,061 --> 00:12:44,428
The maxilla
looks a little deformed.

66
00:12:44,531 --> 00:12:47,261
There`s some odd muscle
structure around the canines.

67
00:12:47,367 --> 00:12:50,200
I`m going to start the "Y"
and check the tracheal mucosa.

68
00:12:55,342 --> 00:12:56,866
Let me ask you something.

69
00:12:58,578 --> 00:12:59,670
Honestly...

70
00:13:01,381 --> 00:13:02,405
you ever have
second thoughts about us?

71
00:13:05,952 --> 00:13:07,078
Sometimes.

72
00:13:09,255 --> 00:13:11,815
But then I remember
how much of an asshole you were.

73
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:13,050
Want to cut me some slack here?

74
00:13:13,193 --> 00:13:15,684
You asked for some time off,
I gave you some time off.

75
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:18,188
-Look, Curtis--
-l`m trying.

76
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:19,560
It`s over.

77
00:13:38,785 --> 00:13:39,877
Call security!

78
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:58,599
Came back to finish you off.

79
00:13:58,705 --> 00:14:00,673
Get out of my way, you freak!

80
00:14:07,781 --> 00:14:09,214
Freeze!

81
00:14:11,017 --> 00:14:13,781
Motherfucker,
are you out of your damn mind?!

82
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:08,430
Hey, you! Freeze!

83
00:15:27,393 --> 00:15:28,758
Hold it right there!

84
00:15:44,644 --> 00:15:46,839
My shoulder--

85
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:48,379
it`s dislocated.

86
00:17:37,657 --> 00:17:38,715
Whistler.

87
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:51,835
Bringing home strays now?

88
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,537
She`s been bitten.

89
00:18:00,113 --> 00:18:01,603
Should`ve killed her, then.

90
00:18:01,714 --> 00:18:03,147
Yeah, I know...

91
00:18:05,752 --> 00:18:07,151
but I didn`t.

92
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:16,288
You watch her close.

93
00:18:16,396 --> 00:18:19,194
If she starts to turn,
you finish her off.

94
00:18:23,403 --> 00:18:24,836
Or I will.

95
00:18:32,412 --> 00:18:33,811
She`s borderline.

96
00:18:35,548 --> 00:18:38,244
Another hour,
she`d be well into the change.

97
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:43,716
Dr. Karen Jenson, listen close.

98
00:18:44,891 --> 00:18:47,189
I`m going to inject you
with allium sativum--

99
00:18:47,293 --> 00:18:48,555
garlic.

100
00:18:49,629 --> 00:18:51,324
This is going to hurt--a lot.

101
00:18:51,431 --> 00:18:52,557
It was Quinn.

102
00:18:53,733 --> 00:18:55,257
Frost`s little errand boy?

103
00:18:56,769 --> 00:18:58,168
You get a lead on him?

104
00:19:00,473 --> 00:19:01,906
Too bad.

105
00:19:04,544 --> 00:19:05,670
Hold her.

106
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:18,923
I give her fifty-fifty...

107
00:19:19,058 --> 00:19:20,650
if she makes it
through the night.

108
00:19:47,787 --> 00:19:49,618
Blade...

109
00:19:49,756 --> 00:19:51,519
the daywalker--

110
00:19:51,657 --> 00:19:53,955
still pursuing
his ridiculous crusade.

111
00:19:57,897 --> 00:19:59,125
How many died?

112
00:20:00,466 --> 00:20:02,661
We don`t have an exact count.

113
00:20:02,769 --> 00:20:04,896
Apparently,
he used a lot of silver.

114
00:20:05,004 --> 00:20:06,471
We`re having difficulty--

115
00:20:06,572 --> 00:20:08,005
Send in Frost.

116
00:20:16,883 --> 00:20:17,975
Deacon Frost.

117
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:23,453
You can come in now.

118
00:20:58,391 --> 00:20:59,688
These nightclubs of yours
are dangerous.

119
00:20:59,792 --> 00:21:01,589
Are they?

120
00:21:01,694 --> 00:21:04,629
They draw needless attention
to our kind.

121
00:21:04,764 --> 00:21:05,856
You know our policy.

122
00:21:05,965 --> 00:21:08,024
Your policy, not mine.

123
00:21:08,134 --> 00:21:10,227
Our livelihood...

124
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:14,405
depends on our ability
to blend in...

125
00:21:15,541 --> 00:21:16,872
and our discretion.

126
00:21:18,077 --> 00:21:20,238
Maybe it`s time
we forgot about discretion.

127
00:21:21,747 --> 00:21:23,738
We should be ruling
the humans...

128
00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:26,648
not running around making
back-alley treaties with them.

129
00:21:26,719 --> 00:21:29,085
For fuck`s sake,
these people are our food...

130
00:21:29,222 --> 00:21:30,246
not our allies.

131
00:21:30,389 --> 00:21:31,617
You`re out of line.

132
00:21:31,757 --> 00:21:33,520
Am l?

133
00:21:33,626 --> 00:21:35,457
Or maybe l`m just
the first to say out loud...

134
00:21:35,561 --> 00:21:37,028
what we`ve all been thinking.

135
00:21:37,163 --> 00:21:38,960
We have existed this way...

136
00:21:39,065 --> 00:21:41,829
for thousands of years.

137
00:21:41,934 --> 00:21:46,530
Who are you
to challenge our ways?

138
00:21:46,639 --> 00:21:48,903
You`re not even a pureblood.

139
00:21:52,345 --> 00:21:53,505
Like it matters.

140
00:21:54,981 --> 00:21:58,815
I was born a vampire...

141
00:21:58,885 --> 00:22:02,446
as was every other member
of this house...

142
00:22:02,588 --> 00:22:03,646
but, you, Frost...

143
00:22:07,126 --> 00:22:09,720
you were merely turned.

144
00:22:12,031 --> 00:22:13,862
The world belongs to us...

145
00:22:13,966 --> 00:22:15,160
not the humans.

146
00:22:16,269 --> 00:22:17,702
You know that.

147
00:22:22,475 --> 00:22:25,103
Do we have
any other business to discuss?

148
00:22:25,211 --> 00:22:29,773
Well, there`s the matter
of our offshore accounts.

149
00:22:29,882 --> 00:22:30,940
We`re having difficulty--

150
00:22:31,050 --> 00:22:32,210
And have you made
the transfer to the--

151
00:22:32,285 --> 00:22:33,650
Gitano...

152
00:22:33,753 --> 00:22:36,688
you may wake up one day
and find yourself extinct.

153
00:23:10,856 --> 00:23:12,050
You`re a week early.

154
00:23:21,067 --> 00:23:23,661
Whistler says l`m building up
a resistance to the serum.

155
00:23:27,173 --> 00:23:29,403
I figured that might happen.

156
00:23:38,617 --> 00:23:40,141
You take care, all right?

157
00:25:24,817 --> 00:25:27,012
Imust be getting soft
in my old age...

158
00:25:27,119 --> 00:25:29,314
Ietting you bring home
a stray like that.

159
00:25:30,623 --> 00:25:33,217
It was damn stupid of you.

160
00:25:33,326 --> 00:25:35,260
Might`ve lucked out, though.

161
00:25:36,529 --> 00:25:38,895
I checked her background.

162
00:25:41,701 --> 00:25:43,999
It turns out
she`s a hematologist.

163
00:25:45,738 --> 00:25:47,535
She might be useful to us.

164
00:25:49,108 --> 00:25:50,541
I doubt it.

165
00:25:51,911 --> 00:25:53,003
I`m serious.

166
00:25:54,146 --> 00:25:55,841
I took a look
at that notebook of hers.

167
00:25:55,982 --> 00:25:58,143
She`s onto something.

168
00:26:00,987 --> 00:26:02,284
I had to increase the dose.

169
00:26:03,990 --> 00:26:05,890
It`s over 50 milligrams now.

170
00:26:05,992 --> 00:26:07,425
That`s getting dangerous.

171
00:26:07,527 --> 00:26:08,858
Just do it...

172
00:26:08,961 --> 00:26:10,758
old man.

173
00:27:10,957 --> 00:27:13,289
Wander off the beaten path,
doctor?

174
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:16,955
Who are you people?

175
00:27:17,063 --> 00:27:18,553
My name`s Abraham Whistler.

176
00:27:19,899 --> 00:27:21,332
You`ve met Blade.

177
00:27:37,483 --> 00:27:39,383
So, am I a prisoner here?

178
00:27:40,953 --> 00:27:42,011
Not at all.

179
00:27:43,155 --> 00:27:44,554
We just had to take
certain precautions...

180
00:27:44,657 --> 00:27:47,125
before we let you go.

181
00:27:47,226 --> 00:27:49,217
You got to understand...

182
00:27:49,328 --> 00:27:50,556
they`re everywhere.

183
00:27:50,663 --> 00:27:52,790
Vampires--

184
00:27:52,898 --> 00:27:54,365
the hominus nocturna.

185
00:27:55,801 --> 00:27:57,393
We hunt them, you see--

186
00:27:57,503 --> 00:27:59,437
moving from one city
to the next...

187
00:27:59,538 --> 00:28:00,937
tracking their migrations.

188
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:02,598
They`re hard to kill.

189
00:28:02,708 --> 00:28:04,471
They tend to regenerate.

190
00:28:04,543 --> 00:28:06,067
And l`m supposed
to believe all this?

191
00:28:06,178 --> 00:28:09,511
You already met Mr. Crispy
at the hospital.

192
00:28:09,649 --> 00:28:11,048
What do you think?

193
00:28:12,952 --> 00:28:14,852
So, what do you use, then?

194
00:28:14,954 --> 00:28:16,922
Stakes? Crosses?

195
00:28:17,056 --> 00:28:19,081
Crosses don`t do squat.

196
00:28:19,191 --> 00:28:21,091
Some of the legends
are true, though.

197
00:28:22,261 --> 00:28:25,424
Vampires are severely allergic
to silver.

198
00:28:25,531 --> 00:28:29,023
Feed them garlic and they go
into anaphylactic shock.

199
00:28:29,135 --> 00:28:30,864
Then, of course,
there`s always sunlight...

200
00:28:30,970 --> 00:28:32,835
ultraviolet rays.

201
00:28:32,938 --> 00:28:35,429
I got this sucker running.

202
00:28:35,541 --> 00:28:37,270
You want to give it a try
tonight?

203
00:28:44,083 --> 00:28:45,243
It`s still heavy.

204
00:28:46,852 --> 00:28:48,114
Well, you`re so big.

205
00:28:50,990 --> 00:28:52,184
If you want to live
to see another day...

206
00:28:52,291 --> 00:28:54,122
you`ll be out of town
by nightfall.

207
00:28:54,226 --> 00:28:56,023
So where am I supposed to go?

208
00:28:59,965 --> 00:29:02,559
You`ve been exposed to them.

209
00:29:02,668 --> 00:29:05,432
One way or another, somebody`s
going to take you out.

210
00:29:10,376 --> 00:29:12,276
There`s a war going on
out there.

211
00:29:13,612 --> 00:29:16,445
Blade, myself, a few others...

212
00:29:16,582 --> 00:29:20,143
we`ve tried to keep it from
spilling over onto the streets.

213
00:29:20,286 --> 00:29:23,380
Sometimes, people like yourself
get caught in the cross fire.

214
00:29:24,557 --> 00:29:27,025
I have blood samples.
I can go to the police.

215
00:29:27,126 --> 00:29:29,788
They own the police.

216
00:29:29,895 --> 00:29:31,692
You have to understand,
they`re everywhere.

217
00:29:31,797 --> 00:29:35,198
Chances are you`ve seen them
yourself and didn`t know it--

218
00:29:35,301 --> 00:29:37,098
on the subway or in a bar.

219
00:29:39,305 --> 00:29:40,738
So that`s it?

220
00:29:42,341 --> 00:29:45,105
You guys just patch me up
and send me on my way?

221
00:29:49,281 --> 00:29:50,748
Here.

222
00:29:50,883 --> 00:29:52,282
Vampire mace--

223
00:29:53,953 --> 00:29:55,921
silver nitrate,
essence of garlic.

224
00:29:56,055 --> 00:29:58,683
You keep your eyes open.

225
00:29:58,791 --> 00:30:00,656
Be careful.

226
00:30:04,830 --> 00:30:06,263
One other thing--

227
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:09,434
buy yourself a gun.

228
00:30:10,870 --> 00:30:12,861
If you start getting
sensitive to daylight...

229
00:30:14,306 --> 00:30:16,399
If you find you`re thirsty...

230
00:30:16,509 --> 00:30:19,603
regardless of how much
you had to drink...

231
00:30:19,678 --> 00:30:22,841
then I suggest you take that gun
and use it on yourself.

232
00:30:26,685 --> 00:30:29,085
Better that
than the alternative.

233
00:31:26,912 --> 00:31:29,278
You have been warned before.

234
00:31:29,415 --> 00:31:32,782
These archives are restricted
to the members of the house.

235
00:31:35,888 --> 00:31:37,788
You are wasting your time.

236
00:31:37,923 --> 00:31:39,891
It`s a dead language.

237
00:31:39,992 --> 00:31:42,586
The ancient texts
can never be translated.

238
00:31:45,164 --> 00:31:46,995
You wouldn`t even
understand them.

239
00:31:49,401 --> 00:31:51,665
Damn it, Frost!
I`m talking to you!

240
00:31:56,041 --> 00:31:57,770
Keep your voice down, Gitano.

241
00:32:00,312 --> 00:32:01,574
We`re in a library.

242
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:02,772
You don`t need to shout.

243
00:32:04,416 --> 00:32:05,815
What are you up to?

244
00:32:18,030 --> 00:32:20,157
What are you going to do?

245
00:32:25,604 --> 00:32:26,696
What?

246
00:32:32,044 --> 00:32:33,602
You bore me.

247
00:33:08,647 --> 00:33:10,308
Remember what we told you.

248
00:33:11,583 --> 00:33:13,642
You keep your eyes open.

249
00:33:13,786 --> 00:33:14,844
They`re everywhere.

250
00:33:16,755 --> 00:33:18,382
But it`s daytime!

251
00:34:18,117 --> 00:34:19,414
How you doing?

252
00:35:37,896 --> 00:35:40,057
Hi, there.

253
00:35:40,165 --> 00:35:42,861
I`m sorry. Whoa! Hold on.

254
00:35:42,968 --> 00:35:45,198
Police officer. I`m sorry, OK?

255
00:35:45,304 --> 00:35:46,965
Police officer.
I didn`t mean to scare you.

256
00:35:47,072 --> 00:35:48,130
The front door was open.

257
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:49,138
What are you doing in here?

258
00:35:49,241 --> 00:35:52,404
I`m just here
on a routine check.

259
00:35:52,478 --> 00:35:55,504
Look, l`m Officer Krieger,
42nd precinct.

260
00:35:56,064 --> 00:35:58,897
You`re Karen Jenson, right?

261
00:36:00,736 --> 00:36:02,169
Your coworkers
at the hospital...

262
00:36:02,304 --> 00:36:04,329
said that you were kidnapped
last night.

263
00:36:06,074 --> 00:36:07,473
Are you OK?

264
00:36:07,576 --> 00:36:10,704
What happened
to the other doctor I was with?

265
00:36:12,381 --> 00:36:15,145
Curtis Webb? He died.

266
00:36:16,585 --> 00:36:19,145
Don`t worry about that
right now, OK?

267
00:36:20,155 --> 00:36:21,247
Why?

268
00:36:22,157 --> 00:36:23,818
Because you`re dead, too,
you bitch.

269
00:36:27,796 --> 00:36:29,423
Bitch! What is it?

270
00:36:32,601 --> 00:36:33,659
What is this, garlic?

271
00:36:33,802 --> 00:36:36,236
Yeah. He said it would work
against vampires.

272
00:36:36,371 --> 00:36:37,838
Vampires?

273
00:36:39,041 --> 00:36:41,168
Who said I was a vampire?

274
00:36:43,512 --> 00:36:44,638
Nobody.

275
00:36:49,651 --> 00:36:51,209
He`s a familiar--

276
00:36:52,187 --> 00:36:53,848
a vampire wannabe.

277
00:36:55,157 --> 00:36:56,283
If he`s loyal...

278
00:36:57,559 --> 00:37:00,289
and he proves himself,
maybe his master will turn him.

279
00:37:02,598 --> 00:37:04,930
Wait a minute.
You used me as bait?

280
00:37:05,067 --> 00:37:06,625
Get over it.

281
00:37:11,473 --> 00:37:12,565
Is all that necessary?

282
00:37:18,046 --> 00:37:19,570
That`s a glyph--

283
00:37:19,681 --> 00:37:21,376
a vampire cattle brand.

284
00:37:21,483 --> 00:37:24,509
It means that Officer Krieger
is somebody`s property.

285
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:26,645
Another vampire tries
to bleed this little hooker...

286
00:37:26,755 --> 00:37:29,053
then they have to answer
to his owner.

287
00:37:33,095 --> 00:37:35,529
We`ve been tracking him
for a long time.

288
00:37:35,631 --> 00:37:37,223
All right.

289
00:37:37,366 --> 00:37:38,993
Officer Krieger...

290
00:37:39,134 --> 00:37:41,932
you going to be
a good little bloodhound, huh?

291
00:37:42,037 --> 00:37:43,868
Tell us what your master`s
been up to.

292
00:37:43,972 --> 00:37:46,497
Great, now you robbing him.
You going to rob me, too?

293
00:37:46,608 --> 00:37:49,907
How do you think
we fund this organization?

294
00:37:50,012 --> 00:37:52,173
We`re not exactly
the March of Dimes.

295
00:37:55,384 --> 00:37:56,874
It`s fake.

296
00:37:59,888 --> 00:38:03,187
Looks like our friend here
has been blood running.

297
00:38:04,326 --> 00:38:05,588
Hillbarn clinic.

298
00:38:05,694 --> 00:38:07,252
I know this place.
It`s a blood bank.

299
00:38:07,362 --> 00:38:09,387
Owned by vampires,
and there`s one in every city.

300
00:38:09,498 --> 00:38:11,659
And they always deliver.

301
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:13,290
So, where were you taking it?

302
00:38:13,435 --> 00:38:14,732
I don`t know
what you`re talking--

303
00:38:16,538 --> 00:38:18,733
Look, take it easy.

304
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:20,865
I`m only going to ask you
one more time.

305
00:38:20,976 --> 00:38:23,604
Where were you taking it?

306
00:38:23,712 --> 00:38:24,906
Go fuck yourself.

307
00:38:25,013 --> 00:38:26,275
Fuck me? No, you fuck this.

308
00:38:44,499 --> 00:38:46,467
You better wake up.

309
00:38:46,601 --> 00:38:49,729
The world you live in
is just a sugar-coated topping.

310
00:38:49,838 --> 00:38:52,170
There is another world
beneath it--

311
00:38:52,274 --> 00:38:53,536
the real world.

312
00:38:53,642 --> 00:38:54,734
And if you want to survive it...

313
00:38:54,843 --> 00:38:58,006
you better learn
to pull the trigger.

314
00:39:01,650 --> 00:39:03,481
Wait a minute.
I`m coming with you.

315
00:39:03,585 --> 00:39:04,677
You`re useless.

316
00:39:08,957 --> 00:39:10,948
I have to stick with you.

317
00:39:11,059 --> 00:39:13,391
It`s the only way
l`ll stay alive long enough...

318
00:39:13,462 --> 00:39:15,293
to find a cure for myself.

319
00:39:15,397 --> 00:39:17,331
There is no cure.

320
00:39:27,941 --> 00:39:29,033
He`s not going to come back.

321
00:39:30,543 --> 00:39:32,101
Nobody`s that stupid.

322
00:39:32,212 --> 00:39:35,340
When you understand
the nature of a thing...

323
00:39:35,448 --> 00:39:37,279
you know what it`s capable of.

324
00:39:55,235 --> 00:39:57,635
It`s Krieger. I`m at 16-0-0-9.

325
00:39:58,905 --> 00:40:00,031
Get me through.

326
00:40:04,644 --> 00:40:06,202
I got a delivery
in progress here...

327
00:40:06,313 --> 00:40:07,712
and I just had a run-in
with Blade.

328
00:40:14,087 --> 00:40:16,715
I got to clear out
that clinic on Hillhurst now!

329
00:40:37,444 --> 00:40:40,106
Looks like we hit pay dirt.

330
00:40:40,213 --> 00:40:42,078
That`s a vampire mark.

331
00:40:42,182 --> 00:40:44,946
It means there`s a safe house
around here somewhere--

332
00:40:45,051 --> 00:40:47,952
a place they can go
with donors coming.

333
00:40:48,054 --> 00:40:50,181
See the valets over there?

334
00:40:50,290 --> 00:40:51,882
They`re vampires.

335
00:40:51,958 --> 00:40:54,324
So is the doorman...

336
00:40:54,427 --> 00:40:55,894
and the whore on the corner.

337
00:40:58,064 --> 00:40:59,088
How can you tell?

338
00:40:59,232 --> 00:41:01,757
By the way they move...

339
00:41:01,901 --> 00:41:03,095
the way they smell.

340
00:41:06,906 --> 00:41:08,897
It`s like a bad dream.

341
00:41:09,009 --> 00:41:11,273
There are worse things
out tonight than vampires.

342
00:41:11,378 --> 00:41:12,538
Like what?

343
00:41:12,645 --> 00:41:14,078
Like me.

344
00:41:15,815 --> 00:41:17,874
OK, vampire anatomy 101.

345
00:41:17,984 --> 00:41:19,576
Crosses and holy water
don`t do dick...

346
00:41:19,686 --> 00:41:21,551
so forget what you`ve seen
in the movies.

347
00:41:21,654 --> 00:41:24,020
You use
a stake, silver, or sunlight.

348
00:41:24,124 --> 00:41:26,058
You know how to use
one of these?

349
00:41:26,126 --> 00:41:29,027
Nope, but l`ll damn sure
learn quick.

350
00:41:29,129 --> 00:41:30,562
The safety`s off,
rounds already chambered--

351
00:41:30,697 --> 00:41:31,959
silver hollow point
filled with garlic.

352
00:41:32,098 --> 00:41:33,497
You aim for the head
or the heart.

353
00:41:33,633 --> 00:41:36,101
Anything else is your ass.

354
00:41:37,704 --> 00:41:40,730
Do you have an invitation?

355
00:42:28,788 --> 00:42:29,880
Kenji!

356
00:42:45,338 --> 00:42:46,635
Where`s the entrance?

357
00:42:46,739 --> 00:42:48,866
I can`t tell you that, man.

358
00:42:52,512 --> 00:42:53,604
I`m going to ask you
one more time.

359
00:42:53,713 --> 00:42:55,544
Where`s the entrance?

360
00:42:55,648 --> 00:42:57,513
OK.

361
00:42:58,585 --> 00:43:00,519
It`s in the freezer.

362
00:43:09,863 --> 00:43:11,353
Come on, man! I told you!

363
00:43:11,498 --> 00:43:12,726
It`s in the fridge!

364
00:43:23,276 --> 00:43:25,335
You give Frost
a message from me.

365
00:43:25,445 --> 00:43:27,572
You tell him it`s open season
on all suckheads.

366
00:44:11,057 --> 00:44:12,991
Some kind of archive.

367
00:44:17,230 --> 00:44:19,630
This must be where they keep
most of their records.

368
00:44:19,766 --> 00:44:21,791
Isn`t this just a little
high-tech?

369
00:44:21,935 --> 00:44:24,233
They`ve got their claws
into everything--

370
00:44:24,337 --> 00:44:26,271
politics, finance, real estate.

371
00:44:26,406 --> 00:44:28,704
They already own
half of downtown.

372
00:44:52,832 --> 00:44:54,732
Frost throws a good party.

373
00:44:54,867 --> 00:44:56,266
Yeah...

374
00:44:56,369 --> 00:44:57,996
but where is he?

375
00:45:12,051 --> 00:45:13,177
Come on, baby.

376
00:45:22,795 --> 00:45:25,059
Don`t keep everyone waiting.

377
00:45:45,151 --> 00:45:47,585
Deacon, there`s someone here
to see you.

378
00:45:51,357 --> 00:45:53,086
I got to talk to you, Frost.

379
00:45:54,494 --> 00:45:56,724
I`m sorry. I had to come here.

380
00:45:56,863 --> 00:45:58,592
It`s a mistake going to Pearl`s.

381
00:45:58,731 --> 00:46:01,165
I know that. Dumb fucking me.

382
00:46:01,301 --> 00:46:02,495
I know you`re disappointed.

383
00:46:02,602 --> 00:46:03,694
Am I that transparent?

384
00:46:03,836 --> 00:46:05,736
You want to meet him?

385
00:46:05,838 --> 00:46:06,736
I can get you guys
in with him...

386
00:46:06,839 --> 00:46:08,739
because we`re tight.
We`re like brothers.

387
00:46:08,841 --> 00:46:10,172
Fuck.

388
00:46:10,276 --> 00:46:11,368
Aw, fuck. Frost.

389
00:46:15,448 --> 00:46:17,575
I`ve been telling these bitches
all about you.

390
00:46:17,684 --> 00:46:20,050
They`ve been dying to meet you.
They are so psyched.

391
00:46:20,153 --> 00:46:22,053
Bad ass bitches. They--

392
00:46:24,123 --> 00:46:26,683
Frost, it`s about Blade.

393
00:46:26,759 --> 00:46:27,919
Aw, he`s busy, you know?

394
00:46:28,027 --> 00:46:29,927
Because when he`s focused
on business...

395
00:46:31,097 --> 00:46:32,826
Frost, this is important.

396
00:46:32,965 --> 00:46:34,899
Blade was waiting for me...

397
00:46:35,034 --> 00:46:37,298
using the girl as bait.

398
00:46:37,403 --> 00:46:39,200
And you were stupid enough
to take it.

399
00:46:39,305 --> 00:46:40,363
Shut up, bitch.

400
00:46:40,473 --> 00:46:41,963
I didn`t know
he was going to be there.

401
00:46:42,075 --> 00:46:43,542
It was a trap, see?

402
00:46:43,643 --> 00:46:44,735
But don`t worry about it.

403
00:46:44,844 --> 00:46:46,869
It`s no problem.
We can still get the girl.

404
00:47:18,544 --> 00:47:20,034
Forget the girl.

405
00:47:20,146 --> 00:47:22,979
-I want Blade.
-I know you do.

406
00:47:23,082 --> 00:47:26,142
You hear me, Quinn?
I want him alive.

407
00:47:26,252 --> 00:47:27,344
What?

408
00:47:30,256 --> 00:47:31,450
Wait a minute, man.

409
00:47:31,524 --> 00:47:33,151
You want him alive?

410
00:47:36,362 --> 00:47:37,920
What`s that smell?

411
00:47:40,933 --> 00:47:44,266
...image carefully, Frost.

412
00:47:44,370 --> 00:47:48,636
You will need 12 purebloods
to make the ritual work.

413
00:47:48,741 --> 00:47:50,606
Krieger, is that you?

414
00:47:50,710 --> 00:47:53,042
He`s here!

415
00:47:53,146 --> 00:47:54,670
This must be Pearl...

416
00:47:54,781 --> 00:47:55,873
the record keeper.

417
00:47:58,785 --> 00:48:01,185
He`s going to kill me!
You need me, Frost!

418
00:48:02,355 --> 00:48:04,016
Pearl, you`re history.

419
00:48:04,123 --> 00:48:06,648
Have the good grace to die
with some fuckin` dignity.

420
00:48:08,361 --> 00:48:10,295
Ruthless bloodsucker.

421
00:48:10,396 --> 00:48:11,488
Congratulations, Blade.

422
00:48:13,232 --> 00:48:14,790
I hear you`ve been lookin`
for me.

423
00:48:14,934 --> 00:48:17,266
-l`m flattered.
-lt`ll pass.

424
00:48:19,739 --> 00:48:20,831
Fuck.

425
00:48:23,309 --> 00:48:24,742
What is that?

426
00:48:24,844 --> 00:48:27,005
That, biscuit boy,
is a U.V. Lamp.

427
00:48:27,113 --> 00:48:29,809
We`re gonna play a little game
of 20 questions.

428
00:48:29,916 --> 00:48:31,474
Depending on how you answer...

429
00:48:31,584 --> 00:48:34,417
you may walk out of here
with a tan.

430
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:35,851
What`s that?

431
00:48:35,955 --> 00:48:39,755
That? Oh, it`s nothing.
It`s routine research.

432
00:48:39,826 --> 00:48:41,953
Actually, it`s a video game.

433
00:48:52,939 --> 00:48:54,338
That must`ve hurt.

434
00:48:54,474 --> 00:48:56,442
It`s a fragment,
a piece of the prophecy!

435
00:48:56,542 --> 00:48:57,839
What prophecy?

436
00:48:57,944 --> 00:48:59,605
Oh, l`m not really sure.

437
00:48:59,712 --> 00:49:01,771
There are so many out--

438
00:49:15,495 --> 00:49:19,556
And there is nothing you can
do about it, daywalker!

439
00:49:19,699 --> 00:49:21,326
Is that so?

440
00:49:22,535 --> 00:49:24,560
Well, that`s what Frost says.

441
00:49:24,704 --> 00:49:27,764
Then you won`t mind me
borrowing this, will you?

442
00:49:27,874 --> 00:49:30,707
If he moves, fry him.

443
00:49:33,980 --> 00:49:35,038
What`s in here?

444
00:49:35,147 --> 00:49:37,877
Nothing. It`s a storeroom.
But you`re wasting your time.

445
00:49:37,984 --> 00:49:39,952
There`s nothing
of importance to anyone.

446
00:49:40,052 --> 00:49:41,952
Then you won`t mind
if I take a peek.

447
00:50:05,845 --> 00:50:07,073
He moved.

448
00:50:38,811 --> 00:50:40,108
What is this?

449
00:50:41,781 --> 00:50:44,272
These are the pages
from The Book of Erebus...

450
00:50:45,351 --> 00:50:46,875
the vampire bible.

451
00:50:49,121 --> 00:50:50,986
It contains everything...

452
00:50:52,291 --> 00:50:53,815
their entire history.

453
00:50:55,361 --> 00:50:57,488
La Magra
must be one of their legends.

454
00:51:02,368 --> 00:51:04,029
Why is Frost so interested
in La Magra?

455
00:51:43,175 --> 00:51:46,008
-Give me your hand.
-Hola, amigo!

456
00:51:48,214 --> 00:51:49,442
Do you remember me?

457
00:52:08,067 --> 00:52:09,125
Give it to him!

458
00:52:27,353 --> 00:52:28,445
Nice one.

459
00:52:29,555 --> 00:52:30,647
Well, well, well.

460
00:52:31,757 --> 00:52:32,951
You took my arm, man.

461
00:52:33,059 --> 00:52:34,959
Remember?

462
00:52:35,061 --> 00:52:36,790
But it`s cool.

463
00:52:38,030 --> 00:52:39,224
I got a new one.

464
00:52:40,499 --> 00:52:42,524
Think l`ll ever play piano
again?

465
00:52:44,437 --> 00:52:46,371
You can slice him,
you can dice him...

466
00:52:46,505 --> 00:52:48,473
but the Quinn man
just keeps on comin`!

467
00:52:48,574 --> 00:52:49,768
Check it out.

468
00:52:49,875 --> 00:52:52,002
I`ve got his pigsticker.

469
00:52:56,348 --> 00:52:57,838
You`re a fuckup, Crease!

470
00:53:03,923 --> 00:53:05,288
You`re just full of surprises...

471
00:53:05,357 --> 00:53:06,483
ain`t you, chief?

472
00:53:15,134 --> 00:53:16,396
Stay with me, sweetness...

473
00:53:18,137 --> 00:53:20,401
`cause l`m not finished
with you yet.

474
00:53:22,842 --> 00:53:24,434
Ah, looky here.

475
00:53:26,712 --> 00:53:28,373
Silver.

476
00:53:28,481 --> 00:53:30,142
Nice craftsmanship, huh?

477
00:53:30,249 --> 00:53:32,183
Probably cost you
a pretty penny.

478
00:53:32,284 --> 00:53:36,584
This here is a man
who takes his job...

479
00:53:38,691 --> 00:53:40,818
just a little too seriously,
don`t you think?

480
00:53:45,731 --> 00:53:47,722
Come to think of it, Blade...

481
00:53:47,867 --> 00:53:49,391
I owe you one.

482
00:53:54,106 --> 00:53:56,700
Actually, if you want
to get technical...

483
00:53:58,310 --> 00:53:59,368
I owe you two.

484
00:54:03,482 --> 00:54:04,813
What`s so funny, bright eyes?

485
00:54:08,053 --> 00:54:09,884
I`m expecting company.

486
00:54:25,371 --> 00:54:27,601
Catch you fuckers at a bad time?

487
00:54:27,706 --> 00:54:29,003
No! No guns!

488
00:54:39,351 --> 00:54:40,579
Fuckin` this way!

489
00:54:49,662 --> 00:54:51,254
Drop the guns!

490
00:54:51,397 --> 00:54:52,591
I need him!

491
00:54:52,731 --> 00:54:55,097
He wants Blade alive! Go!

492
00:54:59,505 --> 00:55:01,302
You`ve been listening in
the whole time?

493
00:55:01,407 --> 00:55:02,465
Keeping radio contact.

494
00:55:02,575 --> 00:55:04,805
Think l`d let him run loose
without a chaperone?

495
00:55:13,719 --> 00:55:15,346
Christ! I`m too old for this.

496
00:55:16,755 --> 00:55:18,882
Somebody get me
a goddamn wheelchair.

497
00:55:29,735 --> 00:55:30,929
He can take care of himself.

498
00:55:31,036 --> 00:55:32,128
Jump!

499
00:56:53,677 --> 00:56:54,769
What are you gonna do?

500
00:56:55,912 --> 00:56:57,243
Oh, my God.

501
00:57:12,696 --> 00:57:13,788
What`s wrong?

502
00:57:15,966 --> 00:57:17,831
It`s dislocated.

503
00:57:20,170 --> 00:57:21,603
Let me help you.

504
00:57:33,283 --> 00:57:34,511
Let me give you--

505
00:57:34,617 --> 00:57:36,346
No! Get away.

506
00:57:52,602 --> 00:57:54,001
You`re one of them, aren`t you?

507
00:57:58,541 --> 00:57:59,940
I`m something else.

508
00:58:07,650 --> 00:58:07,877
I found him when he was 13.

509
00:58:09,652 --> 00:58:11,347
He`d been livin`
on the streets...

510
00:58:11,488 --> 00:58:13,012
feedin` off the homeless.

511
00:58:14,457 --> 00:58:17,449
His need for blood
had taken hold at puberty.

512
00:58:17,594 --> 00:58:20,427
I took him for a vampire
at first.

513
00:58:21,498 --> 00:58:22,988
Almost killed him, too.

514
00:58:24,234 --> 00:58:26,202
Then I realized what he was.

515
00:58:27,404 --> 00:58:29,599
Blade`s mother
was attacked by a vampire...

516
00:58:29,706 --> 00:58:31,333
while she was pregnant.

517
00:58:31,441 --> 00:58:34,433
She died, but he lived.

518
00:58:34,544 --> 00:58:38,275
Unfortunately, he`d undergone
certain genetic changes.

519
00:58:38,348 --> 00:58:42,182
He can withstand garlic,
silver...

520
00:58:42,285 --> 00:58:43,843
even sunlight...

521
00:58:43,953 --> 00:58:45,511
and he`s got their strength.

522
00:58:47,724 --> 00:58:50,522
This time tomorrow,
all his wounds will be healed.

523
00:58:52,529 --> 00:58:55,020
He still ages like a human,
though.

524
00:58:55,131 --> 00:58:57,691
Vampires age slower than us.

525
00:58:59,002 --> 00:59:01,129
Unfortunately...

526
00:59:01,237 --> 00:59:03,228
he also inherited their thirst.

527
00:59:04,774 --> 00:59:07,766
I thought the serum
was supposed to suppress that.

528
00:59:07,877 --> 00:59:09,367
Time`s runnin` out.

529
00:59:11,648 --> 00:59:13,582
His body`s
startin` to reject it.

530
00:59:15,018 --> 00:59:19,045
So far, all my efforts
to find a cure have failed.

531
00:59:23,626 --> 00:59:25,389
Why do you hunt them?

532
00:59:27,630 --> 00:59:29,097
I had a family once--

533
00:59:30,266 --> 00:59:32,427
a wife and 2 daughters.

534
00:59:35,138 --> 00:59:37,572
Then a drifter
came callin` one evenin`...

535
00:59:37,674 --> 00:59:38,766
a vampire.

536
00:59:40,910 --> 00:59:42,571
He toyed with `em first...

537
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:45,648
tried to make me decide...

538
00:59:45,715 --> 00:59:47,307
which order they`d die in.

539
00:59:51,020 --> 00:59:54,217
We kill as many of `em
as we can find...

540
00:59:54,357 --> 00:59:55,915
but it`s gettin` worse.

541
00:59:56,059 --> 00:59:57,458
Because of Frost.

542
00:59:57,594 --> 01:00:01,086
There`s somethin` happenin`
in the vampire ranks.

543
01:00:01,197 --> 01:00:02,630
It`s somethin` big...

544
01:00:02,732 --> 01:00:04,290
and l`d stake my life...

545
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:06,994
that son of a bitch
is at the center of it.

546
01:00:30,693 --> 01:00:32,456
Whistler told me what happened.

547
01:00:36,499 --> 01:00:38,091
He told me what you are.

548
01:00:41,938 --> 01:00:43,997
You don`t know me.

549
01:00:44,107 --> 01:00:46,041
You don`t know
anything about me.

550
01:00:49,312 --> 01:00:51,337
I`m not human.

551
01:00:54,584 --> 01:00:55,642
You look human to me--

552
01:00:55,752 --> 01:00:58,721
Humans don`t drink blood.

553
01:00:58,855 --> 01:01:00,618
That was a long time ago.

554
01:01:02,392 --> 01:01:04,189
Maybe you should let that go.

555
01:01:07,130 --> 01:01:09,030
I have spent my whole life...

556
01:01:09,132 --> 01:01:11,191
Iooking for that thing
that killed my mother.

557
01:01:12,902 --> 01:01:14,870
It made me what I am.

558
01:01:18,308 --> 01:01:21,539
And every time I take
one of those monsters out...

559
01:01:21,644 --> 01:01:24,704
I get a little piece
of that life back...

560
01:01:24,781 --> 01:01:27,272
so don`t you tell me
about forgetting.

561
01:01:31,354 --> 01:01:33,515
He took us by surprise!

562
01:01:33,656 --> 01:01:35,954
Two of them against
your entire security force?

563
01:01:36,059 --> 01:01:38,323
Don`t put that shit on me,
`cause you were there, too!

564
01:01:38,428 --> 01:01:40,123
I`m sure Deacon will
appreciate--

565
01:01:40,230 --> 01:01:42,130
...stabbed in the balls for it,
all right?

566
01:01:42,232 --> 01:01:43,290
You little skeez!

567
01:01:43,399 --> 01:01:44,991
Don`t see the lifestyle
really suits you.

568
01:01:45,101 --> 01:01:47,194
I should put this stump through
that shit-eating grin of yours.

569
01:01:47,303 --> 01:01:50,830
Face it. You were sloppy.
You got what you deserved.

570
01:01:55,345 --> 01:01:58,371
Deac, let me take this guy out.
Look what he fuckin` did!

571
01:01:58,448 --> 01:01:59,710
He took my hand again!

572
01:01:59,816 --> 01:02:02,808
Listen to me. I want him alive.

573
01:02:02,919 --> 01:02:05,615
What the fuck are you talk--
You want him alive?

574
01:02:05,755 --> 01:02:08,121
We`ve been tryin` to kill
this motherfucker for years.

575
01:02:08,224 --> 01:02:09,714
Are you
out of your fuckin` mind?

576
01:02:11,327 --> 01:02:14,819
Big guy, relax.

577
01:02:14,931 --> 01:02:16,091
Be patient.

578
01:02:17,667 --> 01:02:19,225
Now, we got a lot to do here.

579
01:02:20,336 --> 01:02:21,769
I need you, man.

580
01:03:11,154 --> 01:03:13,054
Morning.

581
01:03:13,189 --> 01:03:14,588
How you feelin`?

582
01:03:24,033 --> 01:03:25,125
Look at that.

583
01:03:29,339 --> 01:03:32,172
Whew. Gettin` a little toasty
out here, huh?

584
01:03:34,377 --> 01:03:35,435
When was the last time...

585
01:03:35,545 --> 01:03:38,446
you stopped to appreciate
a good sunrise?

586
01:03:38,514 --> 01:03:40,277
Oh, that`s right.
You were born a vampire...

587
01:03:40,383 --> 01:03:42,851
so you never had
the pleasure, have you?

588
01:03:42,952 --> 01:03:45,682
That`s OK. It`s all right.

589
01:03:45,822 --> 01:03:47,255
Least we`re here together.

590
01:03:47,390 --> 01:03:48,448
Share the moment...

591
01:03:48,591 --> 01:03:51,822
which means a lot to me
by the way, really.

592
01:03:51,928 --> 01:03:53,054
I mean that.

593
01:03:55,498 --> 01:03:58,058
`Cause actually,
when you get to know me...

594
01:03:58,167 --> 01:04:00,397
I`m a fairly
sentimental type of guy.

595
01:04:00,503 --> 01:04:02,664
Bit of an innocent,
you might say.

596
01:04:05,508 --> 01:04:07,373
Do what you want, Frost.

597
01:04:08,544 --> 01:04:10,444
Doesn`t make any difference.

598
01:04:12,014 --> 01:04:13,914
You just don`t fuckin` get it.

599
01:04:16,085 --> 01:04:17,677
You`re never gonna be
a pureblood.

600
01:04:17,820 --> 01:04:19,185
Hold him.

601
01:04:21,891 --> 01:04:23,586
You will never rule us!

602
01:04:36,606 --> 01:04:38,540
Jesus Christ.

603
01:04:38,641 --> 01:04:39,903
Have a nice day.

604
01:04:40,810 --> 01:04:41,936
Sorry, you old dog.

605
01:04:42,044 --> 01:04:43,671
You just got a little too long
in the tooth.

606
01:04:45,448 --> 01:04:47,814
What, man? That was funny.

607
01:04:47,917 --> 01:04:49,441
"Long, tooth." Funny.

608
01:04:49,552 --> 01:04:51,986
Did I tell you the one about...

609
01:05:21,551 --> 01:05:23,485
What have you done
with Dragonetti?

610
01:05:30,860 --> 01:05:33,294
Let`s get down to business,
shall we?

611
01:05:33,429 --> 01:05:35,488
I need 12 volunteers.

612
01:05:47,076 --> 01:05:48,441
What is this?

613
01:05:50,346 --> 01:05:52,644
Smells like a vampire
wiped his ass with it.

614
01:05:52,715 --> 01:05:54,205
I took it from the archives.

615
01:05:54,317 --> 01:05:55,784
It`s written in blood.

616
01:05:55,885 --> 01:05:58,046
It`s from The Book of Erebus.

617
01:06:03,793 --> 01:06:05,385
I think it`s what Frost
has been workin` on.

618
01:06:05,495 --> 01:06:07,759
It`s somethin` about
the Blood God...

619
01:06:07,864 --> 01:06:09,491
the Spirits of the Twelve.

620
01:06:09,599 --> 01:06:12,033
I don`t know.
I can`t make out the rest of it.

621
01:06:12,134 --> 01:06:13,726
Maybe this`ll help.

622
01:06:14,804 --> 01:06:16,066
I`ll figure out something.

623
01:06:17,840 --> 01:06:19,330
So what`s all this?

624
01:06:19,442 --> 01:06:22,002
Took a trip
to the hospital last night...

625
01:06:22,111 --> 01:06:24,011
borrowed some equipment.

626
01:06:24,113 --> 01:06:26,047
For your miracle cure?

627
01:06:28,551 --> 01:06:29,916
This is E.D.T.A.

628
01:06:30,019 --> 01:06:31,077
It`s an anticoagulant.

629
01:06:31,220 --> 01:06:33,450
We use it to treat blood clots.

630
01:06:34,857 --> 01:06:36,188
Now look what happens
when I introduce it...

631
01:06:36,292 --> 01:06:38,192
onto a sample of vampire blood.

632
01:06:40,630 --> 01:06:42,689
Take a step back.

633
01:06:42,798 --> 01:06:44,231
The reaction`s energetic.

634
01:06:53,743 --> 01:06:54,801
Some cure.

635
01:06:54,911 --> 01:06:57,812
I didn`t say E.D.T.A.
was a cure.

636
01:06:57,880 --> 01:07:01,873
But maybe you could use it
to explode some vampire heads.

637
01:07:04,387 --> 01:07:07,618
Wait a minute.
I need a sample of your blood.

638
01:07:07,757 --> 01:07:08,781
Later.

639
01:07:08,925 --> 01:07:10,984
Gotta go downtown.

640
01:07:11,127 --> 01:07:12,287
Need some serum.

641
01:07:12,395 --> 01:07:13,794
Serum can wait.

642
01:07:13,896 --> 01:07:15,295
This is important.

643
01:07:37,420 --> 01:07:39,047
Is he sick?

644
01:07:39,188 --> 01:07:40,246
Cancer.

645
01:07:43,192 --> 01:07:44,716
You have a lot of love for him,
don`t you?

646
01:07:45,861 --> 01:07:48,125
We have a good arrangement.

647
01:07:48,230 --> 01:07:50,824
He makes the weapons.
I use `em.

648
01:07:54,870 --> 01:07:56,997
My mother used to say...

649
01:07:57,106 --> 01:07:59,267
"a cold heart is a dead heart."

650
01:08:17,293 --> 01:08:18,521
You don`t look so good.

651
01:08:19,962 --> 01:08:21,020
I`m just a little tired.

652
01:08:21,130 --> 01:08:23,223
You know we`ve been...

653
01:08:23,332 --> 01:08:24,765
workin` all night.

654
01:08:27,803 --> 01:08:29,828
I guess we didn`t catch it
in time.

655
01:08:31,407 --> 01:08:32,897
You got another day...

656
01:08:33,009 --> 01:08:34,772
two at the most.

657
01:08:39,649 --> 01:08:41,776
For what it`s worth, l`m sorry.

658
01:08:42,852 --> 01:08:45,047
You make it sound like
l`m already dead.

659
01:09:29,699 --> 01:09:31,223
How you doin`, chief?

660
01:09:32,601 --> 01:09:33,693
Easy.

661
01:09:35,304 --> 01:09:36,737
Wouldn`t want
our little friend here...

662
01:09:36,839 --> 01:09:39,330
to wind up on the back
of a milk carton, would we?

663
01:09:42,712 --> 01:09:45,146
It`s nice to finally meet you.

664
01:09:45,214 --> 01:09:47,444
Had my eye on you for years.

665
01:09:47,550 --> 01:09:48,676
I know all about you--

666
01:09:48,784 --> 01:09:52,083
your serum, Whistler--
everything.

667
01:09:52,221 --> 01:09:54,314
Sunblock.

668
01:09:54,457 --> 01:09:56,425
Hey, it`s a start, right?

669
01:09:56,559 --> 01:09:59,357
The goal, of course,
is to be like you...

670
01:09:59,462 --> 01:10:00,554
the daywalker.

671
01:10:02,264 --> 01:10:04,232
You got the best of both worlds,
don`t you?

672
01:10:05,334 --> 01:10:06,961
All our strengths...

673
01:10:07,069 --> 01:10:08,297
none of our weaknesses.

674
01:10:08,404 --> 01:10:11,396
Maybe I don`t see it that way.

675
01:10:11,507 --> 01:10:14,635
Oh, so it`s back to pretending
we`re human again?

676
01:10:14,744 --> 01:10:18,271
Come on. Spare me
the Uncle Tom routine, OK?

677
01:10:18,347 --> 01:10:20,611
You can`t keep denying
what you are, man.

678
01:10:22,284 --> 01:10:25,344
You think the humans will ever
accept a half-breed like you?

679
01:10:25,488 --> 01:10:27,319
They can`t.
They`re afraid of you.

680
01:10:29,058 --> 01:10:30,491
And they should be.

681
01:10:30,626 --> 01:10:31,684
You`re an animal.

682
01:10:31,827 --> 01:10:33,624
You`re a fuckin` maniac.

683
01:10:36,799 --> 01:10:38,198
Look at `em.

684
01:10:38,300 --> 01:10:40,666
They`re cattle...

685
01:10:40,770 --> 01:10:42,704
pieces of meat.

686
01:10:42,805 --> 01:10:45,740
What difference does it make
how their world ends?

687
01:10:45,841 --> 01:10:48,173
Plague, war...

688
01:10:48,277 --> 01:10:49,835
famine.

689
01:10:49,945 --> 01:10:52,209
Morality
doesn`t even enter into it.

690
01:10:53,249 --> 01:10:55,240
We`re just a function
of natural selection, man...

691
01:10:55,351 --> 01:10:57,319
the new race.

692
01:10:59,021 --> 01:11:01,421
Looks like
your mascara`s running.

693
01:11:08,798 --> 01:11:10,959
I`m offering you a truce.

694
01:11:11,066 --> 01:11:12,693
I want you with us.

695
01:11:12,802 --> 01:11:14,736
What do you think, l`m stupid?

696
01:11:23,312 --> 01:11:25,212
You`re familiar
with the Blood God.

697
01:11:28,117 --> 01:11:30,711
You`re nothing to me...

698
01:11:30,820 --> 01:11:33,584
but another dead vampire.

699
01:11:33,722 --> 01:11:35,553
You`re an idiot. You know that?

700
01:11:36,759 --> 01:11:38,920
I came down here
offering you an easy way out...

701
01:11:39,028 --> 01:11:41,155
and you spit it right back
in my fuckin` face.

702
01:11:43,065 --> 01:11:44,828
Careful.

703
01:11:48,070 --> 01:11:50,868
What do I care?

704
01:11:50,973 --> 01:11:53,203
They`re nothing but cattle...

705
01:11:53,309 --> 01:11:55,072
just like you said.

706
01:11:55,177 --> 01:11:58,977
If you wanna take the hard road,
be my guest...

707
01:11:59,048 --> 01:12:01,016
but I promise you,
by the time this is over...

708
01:12:01,116 --> 01:12:03,311
you`re gonna wish they never
cut you from your mother`s--

709
01:12:39,054 --> 01:12:40,180
Go home.

710
01:12:44,026 --> 01:12:44,958
It was simple.

711
01:12:45,094 --> 01:12:47,153
Why do vampires need
to drink blood?

712
01:12:47,263 --> 01:12:49,493
`Cause their own blood
can`t sustain hemoglobin.

713
01:12:49,598 --> 01:12:52,658
Right. It`s a genetic defect,
just like hemolytic anemia.

714
01:12:52,768 --> 01:12:55,362
That means that we have
to treat it with gene therapy...

715
01:12:55,471 --> 01:12:58,907
rewrite the victim`s DNA
with a retrovirus.

716
01:12:59,008 --> 01:13:01,499
They`ve been using it
on sickle cell anemia.

717
01:13:01,610 --> 01:13:03,168
Are you sure that`s safe?

718
01:13:03,279 --> 01:13:06,248
I have no idea,
but I don`t have a choice, do l?

719
01:13:08,817 --> 01:13:11,012
You actually think
this could work?

720
01:13:11,153 --> 01:13:12,347
On me...

721
01:13:14,690 --> 01:13:17,250
On Blade, l`m not so sure.

722
01:13:17,393 --> 01:13:20,988
He didn`t contract vampirism
from a bite like I did.

723
01:13:21,096 --> 01:13:22,654
He was born with it.

724
01:13:22,765 --> 01:13:24,596
It`s part of his DNA.

725
01:13:24,700 --> 01:13:27,601
I`m sure I can cure
his thirst...

726
01:13:27,703 --> 01:13:29,261
but it`s gonna take time.

727
01:13:29,371 --> 01:13:31,839
Ah, we`re out of time.

728
01:13:31,941 --> 01:13:33,636
You saw what was on that disk.

729
01:13:38,948 --> 01:13:40,279
Damn.

730
01:13:42,351 --> 01:13:43,477
Get out of here.

731
01:14:08,310 --> 01:14:10,471
I said get out of here!

732
01:14:16,752 --> 01:14:19,949
Nice place.
Took us a while to find it!

733
01:14:28,230 --> 01:14:29,663
Bite me and get it over with.

734
01:14:29,765 --> 01:14:31,062
I ain`t gonna bite you.

735
01:14:44,713 --> 01:14:45,805
Do your thing.

736
01:16:06,862 --> 01:16:09,160
Frost took her.

737
01:16:16,972 --> 01:16:18,337
Listen to me.

738
01:16:21,410 --> 01:16:22,502
The disk.

739
01:16:24,012 --> 01:16:25,479
He decoded it.

740
01:16:25,547 --> 01:16:28,778
Frost is trying to...

741
01:16:28,884 --> 01:16:32,285
trigger
a fuckin` vampire apocalypse.

742
01:16:34,423 --> 01:16:36,857
There`s some kind of...

743
01:16:36,992 --> 01:16:40,018
vampire God
he`s trying to resurrect.

744
01:16:41,763 --> 01:16:43,196
La Magra.

745
01:16:46,735 --> 01:16:48,293
You`re the key.

746
01:16:49,938 --> 01:16:51,667
He needs your blood...

747
01:16:55,168 --> 01:16:57,261
the blood of the daywalker.

748
01:16:59,939 --> 01:17:02,567
You`re the chosen one.

749
01:17:06,112 --> 01:17:07,477
Listen to me, Blade.

750
01:17:08,948 --> 01:17:10,848
You can`t go after him.

751
01:17:10,950 --> 01:17:12,645
Bullshit.

752
01:17:12,752 --> 01:17:14,879
If Frost gets his hands
on you...

753
01:17:14,988 --> 01:17:17,286
it`s all over.

754
01:17:20,326 --> 01:17:22,556
There`ll be armies
of the motherfuckers.

755
01:17:25,865 --> 01:17:26,957
Shit.

756
01:17:32,005 --> 01:17:33,529
You`re gonna have
to finish me off.

757
01:17:35,308 --> 01:17:36,866
Don`t want me coming back.

758
01:17:38,911 --> 01:17:40,742
We can treat the wounds.

759
01:17:42,415 --> 01:17:44,144
It`s too far gone.

760
01:17:44,250 --> 01:17:46,309
You know that.

761
01:17:49,822 --> 01:17:52,313
Give me your gun.

762
01:17:56,662 --> 01:17:59,222
Give me the goddamn gun.

763
01:18:24,290 --> 01:18:25,689
Now walk away...

764
01:18:25,792 --> 01:18:28,022
you stupid son of a bitch.

765
01:18:32,865 --> 01:18:35,197
Walk the fuck away.

766
01:18:56,222 --> 01:18:57,553
By the time you watch this...

767
01:18:57,657 --> 01:18:59,181
your friend Whistler
should be dead.

768
01:18:59,292 --> 01:19:01,055
If it makes any difference
to you...

769
01:19:01,160 --> 01:19:02,821
he put up quite a fight.

770
01:19:02,929 --> 01:19:05,591
You can find us
at the Edgewood Towers.

771
01:20:43,996 --> 01:20:46,487
You seem a bit tense.

772
01:20:46,599 --> 01:20:48,396
A bit pent-up maybe...

773
01:20:48,501 --> 01:20:50,059
Like you need
to release something.

774
01:20:51,771 --> 01:20:52,829
You know?

775
01:20:52,939 --> 01:20:53,268
Blade not...

776
01:20:55,074 --> 01:20:56,871
givin` it to you maybe?

777
01:20:56,976 --> 01:20:58,967
I don`t know. I just...

778
01:21:00,413 --> 01:21:02,313
I see such a beautiful woman.

779
01:21:04,150 --> 01:21:05,481
Great skin.

780
01:21:08,187 --> 01:21:10,212
I`d like to see you happy,
that`s all.

781
01:21:10,323 --> 01:21:13,417
Is this the part
where you offer to turn me?

782
01:21:15,061 --> 01:21:17,621
It`s either that or a body bag.

783
01:21:17,730 --> 01:21:19,197
Go ahead.

784
01:21:19,298 --> 01:21:20,890
Bite me.

785
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:23,901
I`ll just cure myself.

786
01:21:24,003 --> 01:21:27,063
I did it before,
and I can do it again.

787
01:21:27,139 --> 01:21:28,902
There is no cure, baby.

788
01:21:29,008 --> 01:21:30,270
There is
if you`ve been bitten...

789
01:21:31,777 --> 01:21:33,870
if you were once human.

790
01:21:39,252 --> 01:21:40,719
How`d you get that scar, Deacon?

791
01:21:42,288 --> 01:21:43,550
A born vampire
would have the power...

792
01:21:43,656 --> 01:21:45,089
to regenerate from birth.

793
01:21:45,191 --> 01:21:48,285
You must`ve gotten scarred
before you were turned.

794
01:21:48,394 --> 01:21:50,954
Isn`t that right?

795
01:21:51,063 --> 01:21:53,190
Vampires like you
aren`t a species.

796
01:21:53,299 --> 01:21:55,392
You`re just infected--

797
01:21:55,501 --> 01:21:58,561
a virus,
a sexually transmitted disease.

798
01:21:58,638 --> 01:21:59,969
I`ll tell you what we are,
sister.

799
01:22:00,072 --> 01:22:02,597
We`re the top
of the fuckin` food chain.

800
01:22:02,708 --> 01:22:04,676
The Blood God`s coming,
and after tonight...

801
01:22:04,777 --> 01:22:06,267
you people are fuckin` history.

802
01:22:07,947 --> 01:22:09,312
He`s a hurricane...

803
01:22:09,415 --> 01:22:11,383
an act of God.

804
01:22:11,517 --> 01:22:14,418
Anyone caught in his path
will instantly be turned.

805
01:22:16,389 --> 01:22:18,084
Everyone you`ve ever known...

806
01:22:18,190 --> 01:22:21,455
everyone
you`ve ever fucking loved.

807
01:22:21,560 --> 01:22:25,018
It won`t matter
who`s pureblood and who`s not.

808
01:22:25,131 --> 01:22:27,793
How are you gonna cure
the whole fuckin` world?

809
01:22:34,473 --> 01:22:36,805
And Blade`s blood is the key.

810
01:22:37,076 --> 01:22:38,703
We got an intruder.

811
01:23:07,973 --> 01:23:10,407
I don`t think you understand.
This dude is fuckin` bad.

812
01:23:10,509 --> 01:23:12,500
He had 20 guys around him--

813
01:23:12,645 --> 01:23:14,408
and he`s got shit
he throws at you--

814
01:23:14,547 --> 01:23:15,946
Yeah, the swords.

815
01:23:16,048 --> 01:23:17,447
Throw it in the air,
catch it underneath.

816
01:23:17,550 --> 01:23:18,983
Yeah. Shut the fuck up!

817
01:23:19,118 --> 01:23:20,380
There`s no intruder
where we are.

818
01:23:20,486 --> 01:23:22,420
Look, make it happen, all right?

819
01:23:22,555 --> 01:23:23,681
It`s one guy on foot.

820
01:23:28,361 --> 01:23:30,022
That`s him! Get him!

821
01:23:50,116 --> 01:23:51,515
Why am I hearing gunfire?

822
01:23:51,650 --> 01:23:54,210
Did I tell anybody
to start shooting?

823
01:23:54,320 --> 01:23:55,753
I need him alive.

824
01:24:00,259 --> 01:24:01,783
Please!

825
01:24:01,894 --> 01:24:03,054
I just work for them!

826
01:24:05,531 --> 01:24:07,089
Jesus Christ.
Lock this place down.

827
01:24:07,199 --> 01:24:08,291
Yes, sir!

828
01:25:55,774 --> 01:25:57,298
Eric?

829
01:26:08,521 --> 01:26:10,045
But you died.

830
01:26:11,357 --> 01:26:13,848
I came back, Eric.

831
01:26:13,959 --> 01:26:15,153
That very same night...

832
01:26:17,029 --> 01:26:19,657
when Deacon welcomed me
into his arms.

833
01:26:36,715 --> 01:26:38,615
Jesus Christ.
I thought you`d be happy.

834
01:26:40,519 --> 01:26:42,316
You`re finally reunited,
and you act like this?

835
01:26:44,056 --> 01:26:46,456
Blade, give it up. It`s over.

836
01:26:46,559 --> 01:26:48,720
She belongs to me, buddy.

837
01:26:51,598 --> 01:26:53,156
Don`t look so surprised.

838
01:26:53,266 --> 01:26:55,097
You spent your whole life...

839
01:26:55,201 --> 01:26:57,965
Looking for the vampire
who bit your mother.

840
01:26:58,038 --> 01:26:59,938
Well, here I am.

841
01:27:02,842 --> 01:27:05,970
Who would ever guess you`d
survive your mother`s death?

842
01:27:06,112 --> 01:27:07,511
But you did.

843
01:27:07,614 --> 01:27:09,047
And here we are--

844
01:27:09,182 --> 01:27:11,377
one big happy fuckin` family.

845
01:27:22,962 --> 01:27:24,691
I need my serum.

846
01:27:27,333 --> 01:27:28,732
Maybe when we get outta this...

847
01:27:28,835 --> 01:27:30,962
I`ll take that miracle cure
of yours.

848
01:27:31,037 --> 01:27:32,595
There`s one catch.

849
01:27:36,609 --> 01:27:38,372
If it works...

850
01:27:38,478 --> 01:27:41,311
you`ll lose your strength...

851
01:27:41,414 --> 01:27:43,177
and your ability to regenerate.

852
01:27:44,350 --> 01:27:46,318
You`ll be completely human.

853
01:28:51,117 --> 01:28:52,982
Glad you could make it.

854
01:28:53,086 --> 01:28:55,316
Thanks for the shades.

855
01:28:57,824 --> 01:28:59,519
Our ancestors
called this place...

856
01:28:59,626 --> 01:29:01,321
the temple of eternal night.

857
01:29:04,631 --> 01:29:06,360
Nice, isn`t it?

858
01:29:06,466 --> 01:29:09,492
Apparently, these geniuses
forgot it ever existed.

859
01:29:09,602 --> 01:29:12,127
Fortunately for us...

860
01:29:12,205 --> 01:29:13,638
I`m what you might call a...

861
01:29:13,740 --> 01:29:16,231
student of history.

862
01:29:30,190 --> 01:29:31,316
Why are we here?

863
01:29:34,260 --> 01:29:37,787
This temple was built
for one glorious moment--

864
01:29:37,897 --> 01:29:41,094
this night, for the Blood God.

865
01:29:49,375 --> 01:29:50,672
Thanks.

866
01:29:55,982 --> 01:29:57,381
Let`s see this sword of yours.

867
01:30:01,087 --> 01:30:02,452
Well.

868
01:30:02,555 --> 01:30:03,749
Titanium, right?

869
01:30:03,857 --> 01:30:05,848
Acid-etched?

870
01:30:08,561 --> 01:30:10,256
I`ll get used
to a weapon like this.

871
01:30:16,536 --> 01:30:19,972
What? You look surprised.

872
01:30:21,007 --> 01:30:23,271
I told you, Blade,
I know everything about you.

873
01:30:25,211 --> 01:30:26,303
Hold out your arm, Quinn.

874
01:30:26,446 --> 01:30:28,710
Why, man?
They`re, like, all better.

875
01:30:28,848 --> 01:30:31,146
Hold out your arm. Now.

876
01:30:35,021 --> 01:30:36,113
Deac, l--

877
01:30:41,394 --> 01:30:42,486
Just kidding.

878
01:30:45,465 --> 01:30:48,366
He was fuckin` with me.

879
01:30:51,971 --> 01:30:54,701
He can`t hear you, honey.
The thirst has got him now.

880
01:31:01,347 --> 01:31:02,609
What do we have here?

881
01:31:02,715 --> 01:31:05,309
The precious serum.

882
01:31:07,587 --> 01:31:09,179
How long`s it been
since you shot up?

883
01:31:09,289 --> 01:31:12,053
12, 13 hours maybe?

884
01:31:12,158 --> 01:31:15,559
I bet you`re just dying
for a drink, aren`t you?

885
01:31:18,164 --> 01:31:19,290
What`s it feel like?

886
01:31:21,301 --> 01:31:23,201
Is your blood on fire?

887
01:31:23,303 --> 01:31:25,794
Try some.

888
01:31:25,872 --> 01:31:28,363
You might like it.

889
01:31:28,474 --> 01:31:30,942
Thanks, but I prefer
the real thing.

890
01:31:31,210 --> 01:31:33,235
In any event...

891
01:31:33,379 --> 01:31:35,404
I don`t think you`ll be
needing these anymore.

892
01:31:43,156 --> 01:31:44,248
It`s a shame, you know?

893
01:31:45,692 --> 01:31:47,250
When I think
of what you`ve become...

894
01:31:47,360 --> 01:31:50,022
what you should have become.

895
01:31:50,129 --> 01:31:52,063
I guess I don`t blame you.

896
01:31:52,165 --> 01:31:53,894
I mean, with everything
that`s happened...

897
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:57,094
it`s the human side of you
that`s made you weak.

898
01:31:57,203 --> 01:31:58,795
You should`ve listened
to your blood.

899
01:31:58,871 --> 01:32:00,998
Say what you want...

900
01:32:01,107 --> 01:32:04,235
but, I promise you,
you`ll be dead by dawn.

901
01:32:08,982 --> 01:32:10,142
Get him outta here.

902
01:32:14,687 --> 01:32:16,951
Get these fucks downstairs.
Now.

903
01:32:17,056 --> 01:32:18,887
Come on. Let`s go.

904
01:32:25,198 --> 01:32:28,065
Don`t worry, sweetheart.
We haven`t forgotten about you.

905
01:32:28,167 --> 01:32:29,225
Oh, no, baby.

906
01:32:29,335 --> 01:32:31,667
We got something real special
planned for you.

907
01:32:32,872 --> 01:32:35,864
That surfer boy had a nice ass.
I sucked him dry.

908
01:32:35,975 --> 01:32:37,704
And you`d figure he`d turn, man.

909
01:32:37,810 --> 01:32:39,038
Yeah, but he didn`t turn,
did he?

910
01:32:39,178 --> 01:32:40,577
No. He turned into
some kinda zombie.

911
01:32:40,680 --> 01:32:42,580
It happens sometimes, cutie.

912
01:32:44,050 --> 01:32:45,312
He was fuckin` tripped out.

913
01:32:46,386 --> 01:32:47,410
Pathetic.

914
01:32:47,553 --> 01:32:50,021
These guys are complete scum.
They`ll eat anything--

915
01:32:50,123 --> 01:32:53,786
animals, rodents, corpses,
and sometimes...

916
01:32:55,194 --> 01:32:56,593
they`ll even eat vampires.

917
01:32:56,696 --> 01:32:58,095
That`s a plus.

918
01:32:58,197 --> 01:32:59,687
And bearing that all in mind...

919
01:32:59,799 --> 01:33:01,391
I`d like you to meet
an old friend of yours.

920
01:33:07,507 --> 01:33:08,701
It`s too bad.

921
01:33:08,808 --> 01:33:11,368
I kinda liked her.

922
01:33:11,477 --> 01:33:12,739
What a waste.

923
01:33:34,467 --> 01:33:36,298
I don`t know
what`s happening to me.

924
01:33:37,537 --> 01:33:39,368
No pulse.

925
01:33:39,472 --> 01:33:40,769
And, of course...

926
01:33:40,873 --> 01:33:42,670
there`s the question
of lividity.

927
01:33:55,054 --> 01:33:57,648
I never thought
I would see you again.

928
01:33:57,757 --> 01:33:59,486
Tell me, Karen...

929
01:33:59,592 --> 01:34:01,492
do you ever have second thoughts
about us?

930
01:35:37,890 --> 01:35:39,357
Poor child.

931
01:35:41,227 --> 01:35:42,819
You`re so sick.

932
01:35:44,163 --> 01:35:46,097
So thirsty.

933
01:35:47,200 --> 01:35:48,633
Don`t touch me.

934
01:35:51,137 --> 01:35:54,004
Eric, look at me.

935
01:35:54,073 --> 01:35:56,803
Vampires are my people now.

936
01:35:56,909 --> 01:35:58,376
I`m one of them.

937
01:35:59,579 --> 01:36:00,876
Can`t be.

938
01:36:02,615 --> 01:36:04,105
Yes, it can.

939
01:36:07,353 --> 01:36:09,048
Try to understand, Eric.

940
01:36:11,057 --> 01:36:13,389
Your mother
died a long time ago.

941
01:36:15,962 --> 01:36:17,224
I`ve hunted...

942
01:36:18,998 --> 01:36:20,329
I`ve killed...

943
01:36:22,868 --> 01:36:24,665
and l`ve enjoyed it.

944
01:36:26,272 --> 01:36:27,364
Haven`t you?

945
01:36:29,208 --> 01:36:30,675
I know you have.

946
01:36:33,512 --> 01:36:36,640
Sooner or later,
the thirst always wins.

947
01:37:21,127 --> 01:37:22,253
Come on.

948
01:37:29,168 --> 01:37:30,294
Spread them out.

949
01:37:31,404 --> 01:37:34,305
One on each glyph,
under the towers.

950
01:37:34,407 --> 01:37:36,136
Make it perfect.

951
01:38:17,383 --> 01:38:18,441
Bring the elevator up.

952
01:38:58,624 --> 01:39:00,285
You stupid girl.

953
01:39:00,393 --> 01:39:01,519
What do you think
is going to happen?

954
01:39:01,627 --> 01:39:03,959
La Magra? The Blood God?

955
01:39:04,063 --> 01:39:07,430
That`s a fairy tale
for pretty little vampires.

956
01:39:07,533 --> 01:39:09,023
Then why are you sweating,
pureblood?

957
01:39:10,603 --> 01:39:12,935
You`re afraid
we`re gonna steal your soul...

958
01:39:13,038 --> 01:39:15,598
your pureblood spirit?

959
01:39:15,708 --> 01:39:17,608
You should be.

960
01:39:17,710 --> 01:39:19,200
Read the prophecy.

961
01:39:19,311 --> 01:39:22,542
It`s time you fucks contributed
something to the cause.

962
01:39:26,986 --> 01:39:29,250
Even if Frost is right...

963
01:39:29,355 --> 01:39:31,516
you really think he cares
about you?

964
01:39:31,624 --> 01:39:34,252
You`re gonna die
just like the rest of us.

965
01:40:11,030 --> 01:40:13,590
Tonight, the age of man
comes to an end.

966
01:40:13,699 --> 01:40:16,065
No more compromises.

967
01:40:16,168 --> 01:40:17,465
We`re gonna be gods.

968
01:40:19,138 --> 01:40:20,230
Of course we are.

969
01:40:23,609 --> 01:40:25,042
I`m gonna be naughty.

970
01:40:25,144 --> 01:40:27,942
I`m gonna be
a naughty vampire god.

971
01:40:36,622 --> 01:40:38,089
Gotta stop...

972
01:40:40,259 --> 01:40:42,124
Save your strength.

973
01:40:42,228 --> 01:40:43,354
Blue.

974
01:40:45,531 --> 01:40:48,227
You`re hypovolemic.
You`re bleeding to death.

975
01:40:48,334 --> 01:40:50,302
Need...

976
01:40:50,369 --> 01:40:51,734
serum.

977
01:41:16,662 --> 01:41:17,754
Listen to me.

978
01:41:19,298 --> 01:41:21,528
I want you
to take some of my blood.

979
01:41:29,475 --> 01:41:31,875
Look, just do it.

980
01:41:57,703 --> 01:41:59,068
Is everybody thirsty?

981
01:41:59,171 --> 01:42:02,971
I hope you`re all
very fucking thirsty.

982
01:42:23,829 --> 01:42:24,921
Don`t stop.

983
01:43:43,809 --> 01:43:45,299
How was it?

984
01:44:58,984 --> 01:45:00,383
I`m your mother.

985
01:45:02,888 --> 01:45:05,254
You wouldn`t hurt your mother...

986
01:45:05,357 --> 01:45:06,483
would you?

987
01:45:09,228 --> 01:45:10,320
Come here.

988
01:45:14,900 --> 01:45:17,164
I must release you.

989
01:45:27,546 --> 01:45:29,013
Fuck!

990
01:46:35,414 --> 01:46:36,506
Not anymore.

991
01:46:54,700 --> 01:46:55,758
Kill him.

992
01:46:55,868 --> 01:46:57,859
Wait! I owe you, man.

993
01:46:57,936 --> 01:46:59,767
I got two new hands, Blade.

994
01:46:59,872 --> 01:47:01,635
I don`t know which one
to use to kill you with!

995
01:48:46,211 --> 01:48:48,236
I`m really going
to enjoy this now.

996
01:49:40,499 --> 01:49:42,399
Let`s do this.

997
01:50:36,221 --> 01:50:37,950
You`re too late, Blade.

998
01:50:57,476 --> 01:50:59,000
My turn.

999
01:51:25,237 --> 01:51:27,762
Look at you.
You`re a little bitch.

1000
01:51:29,674 --> 01:51:31,574
What, your serum?

1001
01:51:31,676 --> 01:51:33,041
It can`t help you now, stud.

1002
01:51:40,485 --> 01:51:41,611
Nice shot.

1003
01:52:13,885 --> 01:52:17,343
Some motherfuckers are always
trying to ice-skate uphill.

1004
01:52:59,531 --> 01:53:01,396
Let`s get out of here.

1005
01:53:37,469 --> 01:53:39,369
I need to get back to the lab...

1006
01:53:39,471 --> 01:53:40,597
if l`m going to cure you.

1007
01:53:42,474 --> 01:53:44,465
It`s not over.

1008
01:53:44,576 --> 01:53:46,009
You keep your cure.

1009
01:53:47,279 --> 01:53:49,304
There`s still a war going on...

1010
01:53:49,447 --> 01:53:50,846
and I have a job to do.

1011
01:53:52,317 --> 01:53:54,251
You want to help...

1012
01:53:54,386 --> 01:53:56,286
make me a better serum.

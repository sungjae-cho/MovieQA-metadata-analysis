00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:29,518
- I think this might be it, Paul. Good luck.
- Thanks.

1
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:31,671
Boy, it sure is thick.

2
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:38,469
I'm in.

3
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:43,198
See, your brother's smart.

4
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:46,511
He's smart. Are you as smart
as your brother? I think so.

5
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:52,074
We are so proud of you.

6
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:56,114
- A full scholarship!
- Plus a meal plan.

7
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,317
First one ever in our family.

8
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,960
Of course,
the kid was reading <i>Archie</i> at one.

9
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:05,839
That's for Paul.

10
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,389
- Take this.
- Grandpa, no. I can't.

11
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:18,599
No. You don't know the city.
Everything there is very expensive.

12
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:20,796
Just parking your car costs $8.

13
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,030
Grandpa, I don't even have a car.

14
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,470
Make an old man happy.

15
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,029
Thank you.

16
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,031
Paul, dance with me?

17
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:49,359
Do it. All right.

18
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,558
Yeah! Cool.

19
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:52,795
Come on!

20
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,793
What are you doing?

21
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,591
No. Like this.

22
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,115
Come on, Paul. Do it right.

23
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,711
- You're messing it up!
- What?

24
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,035
There.

25
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,991
- You all packed?
- Yep.

26
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,313
Can I give you a hand?

27
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:26,437
Wiggle that tail section
for me just a skosh, will you?

28
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,397
Don't know what I'm gonna do around here
without my wing man.

29
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,631
I'll be back, soon as they catch on to me.

30
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,150
What have they got to catch on to?

31
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:39,673
Well, it's a tough school and...

32
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,439
...everyone else
will be more used to the city.

33
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:47,077
Did you know that one skyscraper has
more people than the town of Clairmont?

34
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:50,113
And they're all real sophisticated too.

35
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:53,431
You've seen that <i>Seinfeld</i> show, right?
It's just like that.

36
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:56,757
They've all got that
sarcastic kind of humor.

37
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:00,230
And who was purported to be
the funniest kid at Jackson High?

38
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:02,834
You told me a joke the other day.
It was hilarious.

39
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,512
- A frayed knot...
- String...

40
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:07,831
...walks into the bar.
- Wants a drink. Yeah, that was funny.

41
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,478
You're a funny guy.

42
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:15,553
I don't know. I mean, it's such a giant city.
How can you possibly meet anyone?

43
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,355
You want the secret to making friends?

44
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:21,479
- Sure.
- I picked this up in the service.

45
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:25,551
You'll have a lot of buddies
if you remember this one rule:

46
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,595
Interested is interesting.

47
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,713
- What do you mean?
- Well, everybody's got a story, okay?

48
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:37,758
And all they want
is for somebody to listen to it.

49
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,353
People are basically good.

50
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:42,671
If you care about them,
they're gonna want to be your friend.

51
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:46,753
All you got to do is look at people.
Look when you're talking to someone.

52
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:49,269
That's it. Look them in the eye. Focus.

53
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,273
Hear their story.
Hear what they've got to say.

54
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,120
You do that, buddy,
and you can do no wrong.

55
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,235
Yeah.

56
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,109
Thanks.

57
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,469
Wiggle that.

58
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:22,318
Excuse me. Do you want to sit in my seat?
You can have my seat.

59
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,439
That was for her.

60
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,839
You look familiar.

61
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:44,869
- Tall drip.
- That would be me.

62
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,313
Hi. I'm Paul.

63
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,712
Abnormal Psych.

64
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,118
We're in the same class.

65
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,354
See you there.

66
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,312
Left, no. Left, no!

67
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,111
But you're pushing!

68
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:24,077
- Guys, can it go over there?
- No.

69
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:37,071
- Good afternoon.
- What's up, man? How are you?

70
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:43,751
- Let me try that one again.
- No, that's good. Don't worry.

71
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:46,954
See you later.

72
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,628
Hey, guys.

73
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:01,070
That is a great hat.

74
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:04,069
Did the producers of <i>Fargo</i>
have a garage sale?

75
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,435
- Leave it be.
- Here, leave it be.

76
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:11,077
- That fraternity called for you.
- Which one? Which one was it?

77
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,718
Gamma something.

78
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,792
Gamma Delta. Gamma Delta Pi?

79
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,199
Gamma Delta Pi.

80
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:20,717
No, it was gamma globulin, it wasn't
a fraternity at all. It was a blood bank.

81
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:23,229
But they were really interested in you.

82
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:26,030
It was a blood bank.

83
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,072
<i>The Hunger Artist.</i>
It's the story of a performer...

84
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,390
...who fasts as a form of entertainment.

85
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:37,837
Sits in a cage all day. This is how
he manages to entertain his audiences.

86
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:40,190
But, with his dying breath...

87
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:45,595
...he reveals his great secret: He could
never actually find any food that he...

88
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,349
...liked.

89
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:53,797
- I meant that.
- Jerry Lewis, ladies and gentlemen.

90
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:58,272
Listen, do you mind if I continue
with Mr. Kafka's story?

91
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,519
Are you all right?

92
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:03,919
Yeah, I'm okay.

93
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,235
Looks like you banged
your knee pretty bad.

94
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,673
No, I'm fine.

95
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,272
Let's put some ice on it.

96
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:15,395
What was Mr. Kafka saying
about free will versus destiny?

97
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:19,317
Anyone in the class of 167 students...

98
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,960
...all paying $35,000 a year to be here?

99
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,711
You? Lady in the infantry?

100
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,512
- I didn't read it yet.
- I understand that.

101
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:31,837
You had Ben Affleck
on the <i>Leno Show</i> last night.

102
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,993
Great stuff, witty banter,
looking forward to the movie.

103
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:37,799
Perhaps in the future there'll be a course...

104
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:41,793
...on twenty-first century literature,
but until that glorious day...

105
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,991
Want some honey? I have more.

106
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,188
No, thank you.

107
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,039
Listen people, those rectangular slabs...

108
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,918
...you're using as doorstops are books.

109
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,390
Careful. First time you open them,
they'll crack a little bit.

110
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,838
Don't be alarmed.

111
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:01,869
Florence Nightingale, what was Kafka
saying about free will versus destiny?

112
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:04,679
I don't think it's about
free will versus destiny.

113
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:07,797
You don't. Would you mind telling us
what it is about?

114
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:10,395
Sometimes you are so powerless...

115
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:13,677
...the only thing you can control
is how little you can live on.

116
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:14,909
Interesting.

117
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:17,474
You've reduced
the father of modern literature...

118
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,630
...into an anorexic teenage girl.

119
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,070
You just love humiliating me, don't you?

120
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,355
Dora, I'm not going to have one of those...

121
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:29,069
..."I know and you know and we know
and they don't know" arguments in class.

122
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,720
We've agreed that if we do this
it's got to be secret.

123
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:35,395
I know how ashamed you are of me.
I'm just your dirty little secret.

124
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:38,631
Secret means clandestine.
Shame means embarrassed.

125
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,915
I'd think you'd covered that in junior high.

126
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,993
Could you stop treating me like a baby?
Why don't you take me seriously?

127
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,591
I'm risking my job to be with you.
Is that serious enough for you?

128
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:51,240
I'm over 18.
It's not like you're selling me alcohol.

129
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,311
- Do you know Professor Brown?
- No!

130
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,753
- No.
- No!

131
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:58,998
Of course not. He lost his tenure
for having an affair with a student.

132
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:03,278
The board considers that abusing
power we have over impressionable minds.

133
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:07,831
- I could tell them how pigheaded you are.
- You are so condescending!

134
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,834
If I'm not smart enough for you,
then go for your professor girlfriends!

135
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,957
Your capacity to edit out ideas
you don't like makes...

136
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:17,674
...TASS look like
an Al Goldstein publication.

137
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,751
You think I don't know anything.

138
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:24,436
I think you know how to walk
in a pair of platform Mary Janes.

139
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:29,352
I think you know how to style your hair
with an eggbeater.

140
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,796
Save a little time by layering on two,
three weeks' worth of eyeliner.

141
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,996
- God, I hate you.
- You don't hate me.

142
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,469
- Say you don't hate me.
- Let me go! Yes, I do.

143
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:40,472
- Let me go. Stop it!
- Say you don't hate me!

144
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,835
<i>- Hi, Ma.</i>
- Hi, Rho.

145
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,430
<i>- Hi, Brenda.</i>
- Hi, Bren.

146
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:52,120
<i>Hi there, son-in-law.</i>

147
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,869
We're ordering 'za, slap me a big head.

148
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:17,115
I've got the descending dollars
meal plan so I already ate at the union.

149
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,317
I have $120, but it has to last
till the end of this...

150
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,029
Sorry.

151
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,389
Chris.

152
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:35,310
You think you could turn it down a skosh?

153
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:39,234
- "A skosh"? What the hell is that?
- Just a little.

154
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:05,399
I'm going to tell you something,
and this is for your own good, okay?

155
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,753
No one likes you.

156
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:14,069
They don't?

157
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,029
No.

158
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,839
- You didn't notice?
- Well, no.

159
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:24,310
- What did I do? Why doesn't anybody...
- I don't know.

160
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,274
You talk weird, your clothes are lame.

161
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,635
You never come in with a sixer.

162
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:34,958
You're just a wormy little guy who sits
in his room and studies. It's so gay.

163
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:39,233
But I'm on a Regents Scholarship.
If I do badly, they'll kick me out.

164
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:44,195
And I'm not like you guys.
You can just drink all night and still pass.

165
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,551
You must be really intelligent.

166
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,551
No, believe me. We're not.

167
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:52,031
You just got to play it smart.

168
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,192
Take a few Mickeys.

169
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:57,477
- "Mickeys"?
- Mickey Mouse. Cake. Easy classes.

170
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,951
I have to take my prerequisites.

171
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:05,030
I mean, take whatever you want.
Just try not to be so much like...

172
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,349
...you.

173
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:10,477
Well, you know what I mean.

174
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,791
Yeah, I guess so.

175
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,478
Just trying to help.

176
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:19,915
Chris.

177
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,348
- What's a sixer?
- It's a six-pack.

178
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,191
Beer. Thanks.

179
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,757
Hi, Rho. Hi, Bren.

180
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,839
Excuse me.

181
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:56,079
Come here, please.

182
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,353
What can I get you?

183
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,754
Your pantyhose.

184
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:02,235
How about a screwdriver?
They're really good here.

185
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,197
I'll give you $50 for them.

186
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,995
You can get three for $10 at Wal-Mart.

187
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,114
$60.

188
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:14,190
Please order a drink.
Just get a beer and I'll think about it.

189
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,349
Okay.

190
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:21,230
Honey, do you have anything smaller?
We can't change this yet.

191
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:23,949
Thanks.

192
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,199
- Why'd you do that?
- Get small bills while they're sober.

193
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:30,750
When drunk, they won't know what
they gave you. Supplement your tips.

194
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:34,992
- You mean give them the wrong change?
- They're donating to your college fund.

195
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,998
- Yeah, but that's stealing.
- You're funny.

196
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:43,679
- You are such a little shit.
- Annie, get back here!

197
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,751
You want everyone to think
you're Mr. Stud.

198
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:46,955
I had to tell them.

199
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:51,352
- You did not!
- It's "Truth or Dare"! That's how you play.

200
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,948
What's wrong with you,
are you're unstable?

201
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:56,918
You think it makes me want you?
Must you rub my nose in it?

202
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,912
Are you out of your goddamn mind,
you raving lunatic?

203
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,956
Look at her, man, she's a psychopath!

204
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,028
Here.

205
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,199
- Sal, it's 11:30.
- I'm talking here.

206
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:12,113
If I miss the 11:50, then I can't get home.

207
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,799
Give me the money.

208
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,153
If people would show
a little appreciation...

209
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:20,152
Nobody appreciates anything
you do for them anymore.

210
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,109
You're $40 short.

211
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,316
What? That's impossible.

212
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,231
Want to take it up with Victor?

213
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,675
I don't think that's something
you want to do.

214
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,637
There must be some mistake.

215
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:33,308
All right, he should be here soon.

216
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:40,111
- Here.
- Thank you.

217
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:45,798
<i>The 11:50 for Westchester,</i>
<i>Bronx and Yonkers...</i>

218
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:48,678
<i>... now leaving on Track 17.</i>

219
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:52,357
<i>11:50 now leaving Track 17.</i>

220
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:55,639
Wait, wait! No!

221
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,473
Stop!

222
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,958
Ma, listen.
I got totally screwed at study group.

223
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:24,634
My topic was last, and I had to stay.

224
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,280
I rushed to the station,
but I missed the last train.

225
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,873
<i>Where are you, Grand Central?</i>

226
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:31,838
No, I went with my friend Linda
to the girls' dorm.

227
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,399
<i>Can you stay there?</i>

228
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,994
- Yeah, it's cool. I'll sleep on her couch.
- <i>Okay.</i>

229
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:38,753
- All right, I'll call you tomorrow. Bye.
<i>- Bye.</i>

230
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:43,599
She's going to "star 69."
Lt'll only be a second.

231
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,112
Rubin Hall, ladies' residence.

232
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:53,034
<i>- Is this a dorm for girls?</i>
- Yes, this is a dormitory for women.

233
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,917
<i>Can anybody just get in there?</i>

234
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,639
No, there are security doors
and a night watchman.

235
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:00,354
<i>- Okay. Thank you.</i>
- You're welcome.

236
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:03,674
That was great. Thank you.

237
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,113
Bless you, honey.

238
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:34,837
I got this girl's phone number last night.
Guess what she's got.

239
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:35,796
Herpes?

240
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:38,474
No, genius, she's got a pierced tongue.

241
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:40,437
It means she's gay, you know.

242
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:44,150
- What are you talking about?
- It adds to their sensual pleasure.

243
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,754
- No, it's for my sensual pleasure.
- It is not.

244
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:48,592
Let's ask Dr. Drew.

245
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,676
We got Chris on the phone from Seattle.

246
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:54,513
He wants to know which sex prefers
a pierced tongue more.

247
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:55,919
I don't get it.

248
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:03,113
Come on, guys.
I just washed all these towels.

249
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:06,716
Speaking of which, Paul,
next time don't use so much starch.

250
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,836
Has anybody seen my toothbrush?

251
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,709
You can't find it? Shit.

252
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:20,758
You better find that thing.
Those things can cost up to $2.50.

253
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:23,308
Yeah, and yours has such a nice handle.

254
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,839
You still don't qualify for financial aid.
Why don't you try student placement?

255
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:43,277
Those jobs only pay $5 or $6 an hour.
I make three times as much at the bar.

256
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,636
I can't pay tuition unless I work more...

257
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:48,154
...and I can't do that
because I have to travel home.

258
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:51,949
Not everybody who's accepted
can actually attend this school.

259
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,589
Why don't you try
to get yourself emancipated?

260
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:56,477
Okay. Thank you.

261
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:16,190
Where are your parents' tax returns?

262
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:18,079
I don't have them.

263
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,118
How can you prove they're not
claiming you as an exemption?

264
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,510
They kind of are, but if I get emancipated...

265
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:27,751
...and I get financial aid,
then I'm sure they'll stop.

266
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:30,391
Right. Who's your attorney?

267
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,517
Attorney against my parents?

268
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:42,510
Are you saying that it's uncontested?

269
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:43,749
Yeah.

270
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:48,197
Then you'll need W-2s, rent stubs,
proof of residence, power and water bills.

271
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,878
I don't have a residence.

272
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:53,589
You can't get emancipated
to live on the street. Okay?

273
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:56,997
I can't apply for work-study
unless I get emancipated.

274
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:01,079
- Then you'll have to get an apartment.
- But all my money goes to tuition.

275
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:03,720
Then you'll just have to make more money.

276
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:28,432
Noah, get up.

277
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:31,553
Give me a hand! Here, hold it up.
Hold it up.

278
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:37,549
Guys, shouldn't we call
the resident assistant or housing services?

279
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:41,715
We're not supposed to have waterbeds.
They'll think we did something bad.

280
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:45,475
Dude, it's only water. Let it dry, man.

281
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:48,030
- Guys!
- Noah, come on.

282
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:49,989
Noah!

283
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:02,915
- We have to resolve this Paul issue.
- That guy's totally weak.

284
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:05,958
We gave it our best shot.
I say we get rid of him.

285
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:10,238
Yeah. Look at him and look at us.
The guy can't possibly feel like he belongs.

286
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:14,797
If he was with his own kind, he'd feel
more comfortable, better about himself.

287
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,518
It would be best all around.

288
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:20,479
I try to get along with everybody
but that guy's got no personality.

289
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:23,160
And he reflects poorly on us
with the ladies.

290
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:27,393
- Do you take student meal vouchers?
- No.

291
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,235
Okay, Paul.

292
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:45,357
Apparently, you've caused
some problems for your roommates.

293
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,874
Let's see if I can't resolve this situation.

294
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:50,076
What are your complaints with Paul?

295
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,755
It's not that I don't like Paul as a person.

296
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:56,070
He a very fun-loving guy.

297
00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:00,632
But we've divided up our chores
for the week and...

298
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:05,556
...he's always too busy
or has some excuse.

299
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:08,628
And we wind up doing his.

300
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,154
How about you?

301
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:14,951
He says derogatory things
about other ethnic groups.

302
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:17,838
And even though I believe
in freedom of speech...

303
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:21,351
...you know, it's like the way
smoke is air pollution...

304
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,949
...I feel that racial slurs are
a form of hearing pollution.

305
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:30,988
I don't want to sound girly
about any of this...

306
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:35,676
...but I think all of us have taken
an exception to Paul's personal hygiene.

307
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:37,871
How about he makes more of an effort?

308
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:40,997
We'll meet again after a grace period
and see how it's going.

309
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:43,071
I don't know if I could do that.

310
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:47,392
I love making racial slurs,
and I hate doing chores...

311
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:50,757
...and indoor plumbing is
just way too confusing for me.

312
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:54,477
That's who I am,
and if they can't deal with it then...

313
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,952
...I'd rather live alone.

314
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:03,069
I'll file this with Housing
and see if we can't get you moved.

315
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:06,074
In the meantime, better start packing.

316
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:30,112
- You from the veterinary school?
- No.

317
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:31,952
No? Then why'd they pick you?

318
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:36,431
There's a housing shortage, and I'm on
a list for another dorm, but since I'm not...

319
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:39,318
...a paying customer,
I'm sure I'm a low priority.

320
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:42,268
- That's okay, baby, it's all right.
- I'm sorry.

321
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:43,873
Did the mean man hurt you?

322
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:47,236
It's okay. Give me kisses. Don't worry.

323
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:50,792
It's all right, baby.

324
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,912
These are the operating rooms.

325
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,753
But don't ever go in there. They're sterile.

326
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:58,958
All you have to do is
change their poopie papers...

327
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:03,716
...give them their medications and
if any of the animals have an emergency...

328
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:05,552
...you got to page the vet.

329
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:08,149
And this here is your room.

330
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:11,392
You got your hot plate,
your bed and the refrigerator...

331
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:13,550
...but that's for employees only.

332
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:18,870
- You'll get used to the smell.
- Can I get some help over here?

333
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:20,949
Hold her down.

334
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,313
Shut up.

335
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:27,438
I could use your help
on a tooth cleaning as well.

336
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:31,078
You do something with her, okay? Thanks.

337
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,029
Yeah, I know.

338
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:37,678
I hear you. Boy, do I hear you.

339
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:43,069
Dora, Victor wants to see you.

340
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,590
It's okay. You'll be okay.

341
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:52,599
- I don't think this is working out.
- What? Why not?

342
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:57,032
Last night, Kitty's station, $1200,
Angel's, $1400...

343
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,473
...your station, $600.

344
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:01,711
But I'm in the back.
There's always less people back there.

345
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:05,315
You're not getting it.
What do you do if a customer talks to you?

346
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:07,352
I listen, act interested.

347
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:10,000
No. You say something funny,
then walk away.

348
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:13,038
So if they want to talk,
they got to buy more drinks.

349
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:16,079
- Okay, I'll try and do better.
- No, forget it.

350
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:19,034
You're too smart or too stupid,
but ain't happening.

351
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:21,509
It's a shame. Could have made
some real money.

352
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,272
Take this and get out of here.

353
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:26,158
Please let me finish tonight.
I really need the tips.

354
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:29,357
Victor, she's working her way
through college.

355
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:31,398
Did I ask you?

356
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:35,750
Come on, take it. For last week. Take it.

357
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:43,313
Man, our T.G. Party was a total bust.

358
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,749
Every time I got close
to hitting it with a mama...

359
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:48,274
...a girlfriend showed up
to screw everything up.

360
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:52,558
What we need is a higher female-to-male
ratio, like in cool nightclubs...

361
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:55,200
...where they let in five times
as many women as men.

362
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:58,556
How are we going to get
five times as many women to show up?

363
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:01,399
We have a party,
but we call it a fundraiser.

364
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:04,514
- Think of a charity.
- It's got to be the right charity.

365
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:06,033
It's got to attract hotties.

366
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:08,315
- What's the country with all the babies?
- China.

367
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,992
- Romania.
- No, but wait.

368
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:12,913
That's going to give them
the wrong message.

369
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,752
All right. How about AIDS?

370
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,598
There's a mood-setter.

371
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,358
How about a suicide hotline?

372
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:21,159
But do they need a fundraiser?
All they have is phones.

373
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:22,229
Hey, backpacks.

374
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:25,278
- What's going on?
- Inspections for drugs and alcohol.

375
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:26,913
- What?
- Since when?

376
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,712
O'Brien is in a coma.

377
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:29,710
So?

378
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:31,995
So the board instigated new policies.

379
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:33,439
This is whack.

380
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:36,233
- Can they even do this?
- I'll call my father's lawyer.

381
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:40,598
Our parents pay a lot of money for us
to enjoy our college experience.

382
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,192
Hey, my metal detector!

383
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,231
I don't know how to make this any easier
for you. It's character evaluation.

384
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:52,788
It's not unlike one of those
"VH-1 Legend" shows...

385
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:56,668
...except you're discussing a fictional
character instead of a coked-out singer.

386
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:59,118
Understand this?

387
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,952
How about this? Dismissed.

388
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,792
Ah, yes.

389
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:06,710
- I don't understand my grade.
- That's the letter we use for failure.

390
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,552
See me after class.

391
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:12,874
- Do you have to ask him something?
- No, it's okay. Go ahead.

392
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,119
Professor Alcott?

393
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,109
- Yes.
- Hi.

394
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:21,192
I'm on a Regents Scholarship.
I have to maintain a 3.5 average.

395
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:24,556
I can do it with two As and a B+
because I can get a B in Physics.

396
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:27,598
I can't get less than a B
because I'd only have one A left.

397
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:31,434
The thing is, my roommates
never let me have any quiet study time.

398
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:32,913
And now I've had to move.

399
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,833
I have this kind of crazy philosophy
that your grades...

400
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:38,673
...should represent your grasp
of the material...

401
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:41,792
...not your negotiating skills,
which are amazing, by the way.

402
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:45,714
No, I would never ask for a grade
that you didn't think was fair.

403
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:49,628
It's just that since I have 20 credits
and I only need 16.

404
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:52,877
I hoped to take this class pass-fail,
so I don't get kicked out.

405
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:56,748
Sir, I promise I wouldn't slack off.
In fact, I'd work doubly hard.

406
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:59,673
I'm ecstatic to hear your plans
to work doubly hard.

407
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:03,389
Because Lit 100 courses are
never given pass-fail.

408
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:06,119
Why don't you take
all that non-slacking energy...

409
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:09,272
...and try to focus it
toward your finals. Okay?

410
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:11,029
Yes, sir.

411
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,158
That wasn't very nice.

412
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:18,678
I'm a mean son of a bitch.
When's your next class?

413
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:20,114
Not till 6:00.

414
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:21,599
I'm off at 4:00.

415
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:25,794
Okay, but can we discuss something
that I want to ask you about...

416
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:27,911
...in a non-emotional way?

417
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:32,232
Seriously, how am I supposed to teach
Camus when you're wearing this sweater?

418
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,072
I think we may have to take it off.

419
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:37,357
Do you think 4:00, my place?
I could be wrong, but I think so.

420
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,590
I'm sorry you feel that way
about the French.

421
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:43,798
It is a course on European Literature.
Can't ignore the whole country.

422
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:49,875
Paulie.

423
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,434
- Can I help you?
- Correct me if I'm wrong.

424
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:58,592
Didn't you kick me out of our room
for wetting your bed?

425
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:01,114
Wait a minute.
Noah didn't talk to you about this?

426
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,838
Look, what do you want?

427
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:05,111
You thought we kicked you out?

428
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:09,232
Come on. You're my asshole buddy.

429
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,749
- Look, since O'Brien died...
- What?

430
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,877
O'Brien, on the 8th floor, died.

431
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:17,430
They've instituted a new policy where
they're doing grocery inspections.

432
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,192
Making sure no alcohol comes in.

433
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:22,556
They're doing spot checks to make sure
there's one guest per person.

434
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:26,315
Just because one guy can't monitor
his buzz all of us got to suffer.

435
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,834
Which is why Adam
came up with this great idea...

436
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:31,559
...that one of us has to get
an off-campus residence.

437
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:34,913
- Noah didn't explain this to you?
- No, he didn't.

438
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:37,509
Maybe I'm the world's biggest cynic.

439
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:41,036
But I'm finding all of this
very hard to believe.

440
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,350
Paul, why would I play you, dude?

441
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,196
Why? Why?

442
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:50,712
I don't know why. Why would you reset
my alarm clock so I'd be late for class?

443
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:54,713
Why would you hide all my clothes
and fill the drawers with Styrofoam?

444
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:57,792
Why did you glue together
every page of my Psych book?

445
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,751
You know how long that took?

446
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:05,914
I thought you'd laugh.
That's just stuff we do to each other.

447
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:13,635
All I wanted is for you to feel like
you were part of the group, man.

448
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:14,994
I mean, seriously.

449
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:18,709
Remember those talks about
how nobody liked you, what you could do?

450
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:21,229
I was trying to help you get in with us.

451
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:24,756
I was tired of seeing you
sitting around by yourself. Come on.

452
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:28,670
Can we have a trial run
get-together tonight?

453
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:31,674
I guarantee you will tap some fine hide.

454
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:36,635
I have two Everclear tickets for tonight
and I was going to ask a girl.

455
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:37,709
Smooth.

456
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:45,999
This is Annie's.

457
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:50,950
I don't know where that came from.

458
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:52,115
- Paul?
- What?

459
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:53,872
Are you hitting my bitch?

460
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:57,875
No! No! I'm not hitting your bitch.

461
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,310
I've never hit your bitch
nor would I ever hit your bitch.

462
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,271
I'm just playing with you.

463
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:06,877
- Because, you know, right? I mean...
- I know.

464
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:09,554
I knew it was there. I put it there.

465
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:15,474
- I got to go. Okay? Dust.
- Dust. Dust.

466
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,279
God.

467
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:25,399
Every part of me is satisfied.

468
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:28,634
Even my teeth are relaxed.

469
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:30,555
Oh, shit.

470
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:34,352
I'm late. I got a 7:00 workshop.

471
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:39,637
- Wait. You said we'd discuss something.
- Yeah, I'm listening.

472
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:44,239
I got fired from my job and I won't have
the money for next semester's tuition.

473
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:45,639
What are we going to do?

474
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:49,235
If I get a job on graveyard shift,
I'll earn money instead of commuting.

475
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:51,788
- I could maybe just crash here...
- Hold on.

476
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:55,039
I mean, not even in the bed.
I could sleep on the couch.

477
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,678
No, I don't want to go there.

478
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:58,512
- Go where?
- That domestic place.

479
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:01,876
I don't want your grunge gothic-wear
lying around in my closet.

480
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:05,999
Or those blackhead strips in the bathroom,
posters up of Axl Rose.

481
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:07,877
Whatever adolescent icon. Listen.

482
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:10,758
You know how these things sour
when people get too close.

483
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:12,512
You get tired of each other.

484
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:15,558
I don't want that ever to happen to us.
You know why?

485
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,398
Because I love you too much.

486
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:20,472
So much you'd have me sleep
on the street or drop out of school.

487
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:22,710
I love the sweet... Where are my notes?

488
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:25,553
My sexy, smart girl that I have fun with.

489
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:29,230
If I wanted teen angst,
I'd watch reruns of <i>My So-Called Life.</i>

490
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:32,350
I'd do anything to make you happy.

491
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:36,317
I type your papers, I grade your tests.

492
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:39,119
I've told you not to do that
unless you want to.

493
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:44,832
Just because I'm giving doesn't mean
I can expect a man to lift a finger for me.

494
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:49,432
If she were alive, Betty Friedan
would applaud your little epiphany.

495
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:51,878
If Kafka were alive, he'd say:

496
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:55,191
"Stop misinterpreting my novels,
you pretentious bonehead!"

497
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:31,829
Hey, again.

498
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:33,509
Hi.

499
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:36,799
I eat here every night.
I've never seen you come in.

500
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:39,314
You eat in the student center every night?

501
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:41,868
There's like 20 restaurants on every block.

502
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:45,160
Yeah, I don't know New York that well.

503
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:49,115
You should do some exploring.
It's the best city in the universe.

504
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:51,349
See you.

505
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:54,035
- Where are you going?
- Job interview.

506
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:56,831
- I'll walk you.
- Okay.

507
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,434
I don't see why Alcott
wouldn't let you go pass-fail.

508
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:04,909
Rules are rules, right? What can he do?

509
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:08,793
Say, do you know this group Everclear?

510
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,468
- Are you kidding? They're my favorite.
- They are?

511
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:14,632
I love self-loathing complaint-rock
you can dance to.

512
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:17,871
You want to see them tonight?
I've got two tickets I came across.

513
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:19,029
Shut up!

514
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:22,279
But you know, I got these three interviews.

515
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:25,470
But there's an opening act, right?

516
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:28,111
Yeah. There's an opening act.

517
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,151
Can I meet you there at 9:30?

518
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:34,074
9:30 would be great.

519
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:35,949
But here.

520
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:38,793
Why don't you take one,
and if your interviews go long...

521
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:41,155
I could just meet you inside.

522
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:42,635
Thanks.

523
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:44,631
Now, don't go scalping that.

524
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,389
Okay.

525
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:51,915
Why did you ask me?
You hardly know me.

526
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:55,513
Sure I do. I know you're smart.

527
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:58,634
You care when people bang up their knees.

528
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:01,553
You don't waste money on food
when you can get free honey.

529
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:02,959
You're cute.

530
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:07,119
You take a train from somewhere, right?
The Number 6. I know that.

531
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,274
All right.

532
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,356
All right, I'll meet you there.

533
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:14,350
Paul.

534
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:16,239
I'm Dora.

535
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:20,399
- I'll see you, Paul.
- Yeah, I'll see you, Dora.

536
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:22,874
Dust.

537
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:37,835
When did O'Brien die?

538
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,797
- After you left.
- Before the crackdown.

539
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,632
First they changed the dorm code.

540
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:44,678
Then we got our idea
which we thought Noah told you.

541
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:45,875
My bad.

542
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:48,474
I feel awful I never got to know him better.

543
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:50,471
Yeah, that would've saved him.

544
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:56,479
I'll never forget how weird it felt...

545
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:59,831
...when I looked out the window
and I see this body go by.

546
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:06,597
- I thought he was in a coma.
- Yeah. He fell into a coma.

547
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:10,834
Come check out my lighting design.
Look at this. You ready?

548
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:16,836
Lighting changes the party decor entirely.

549
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:18,399
Pretty extravagant.

550
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:22,388
Women expect you to set the mood.
We're not in high school anymore.

551
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:25,553
What about in here?

552
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,560
That's the operating room. Not in there.

553
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:31,594
I'm going to go grab a slice.
Want to come?

554
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,709
- Sure.
- Let's go.

555
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:36,712
- Look what I found.
- Come on.

556
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:42,513
That's for the animals.
You don't need flea medication, do you?

557
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,594
I don't know.
He has slept with a lot of dogs.

558
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:49,599
All right, come on.

559
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:04,552
- What's this?
- An application for the night shift job.

560
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:07,638
- Where you get this?
- From the guy who was just here.

561
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:11,233
Night shift is dangerous.
We can't have girls.

562
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:15,309
This is the third time this has happened.
Why don't you say so in your ad?

563
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:18,995
- He should not have given you.
- I don't know if that's even legal.

564
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:23,358
Actually, it's not. It's in violation
of sexual discrimination laws.

565
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:25,915
- Call next week.
- Yeah, right.

566
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,111
Thanks for trying to help out.

567
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:38,353
It's disgusting the way women get treated.

568
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:40,874
I just wish they didn't waste my time.

569
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:43,474
Do you have plans tonight?
There's a great fundraiser.

570
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:45,278
It's blowing off the hook.

571
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:48,079
I have a date,
but it doesn't start for 45 minutes.

572
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:51,550
Come drop by. It's for a good cause.
Homeless animal shelter.

573
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:53,551
I don't have any funds to donate.

574
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:56,757
It's okay. Just come in out of the cold
until your date.

575
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:00,278
Okay. But only if I can help you carry that.

576
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:07,110
What's up, man? How's it going?

577
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:08,878
Hey, how are you?

578
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:12,834
You look amazing. I like this very much.
That's very nice. Come in.

579
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,831
So, how've you been?

580
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,439
What a turnout, huh?

581
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:19,956
I don't know how I'll find my date.

582
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:29,033
Excuse me. I'll take a T-shirt.

583
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:32,550
You know what? I'll take two.

584
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:48,350
It's just juice. Drink it up.
You look a little dehydrated.

585
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:52,715
It's good. It's got juices and cranberry.

586
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:55,758
Do you know cranberry juice is good
for your urinary tract?

587
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:57,956
- What time is it?
- It's early.

588
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:02,478
So, which do you like better,
yellow or checks?

589
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:06,989
Why?

590
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:10,635
Because I want to know which kind of cab
to call when we're done.

591
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:13,397
Dude, come here. Come here.

592
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:18,711
You got to help me. Lisa is all primed,
but her helpful friend, fat Rita...

593
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:21,473
...will take her home
unless she gets some action, too.

594
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:24,677
First of all, I'm way too wasted
to be operating heavy machinery.

595
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:28,036
Second of all, I got this little spinner
all G-ed out. She's liquid.

596
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:31,032
Leave her on the back burner.
Take one for the team.

597
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:32,959
You owe me one.

598
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,837
- Count on it.
- All right.

599
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:05,872
Where's the bathroom?
I don't feel so good.

600
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:08,633
- What is it? Your head?
- No, it's my stomach.

601
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:10,119
Here, this'll settle it.

602
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:11,952
- What is it?
- It's for your tummy.

603
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:14,998
Drink it real fast.
That'll help your stomach.

604
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:29,552
Where is the bathroom?

605
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:47,994
Yo, Dora, where you been all night?

606
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:52,398
You got to give me your number
before you go, okay?

607
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,639
Excuse me. This seat's taken.

608
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:41,193
- What?
- This seat is taken.

609
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:59,716
- This seat's taken!
- What?

610
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:02,156
I know. We'll move when they come.

611
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:44,479
Taxi, here.

612
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:47,914
Good girl.
How'd you get out of your cage?

613
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:00,834
Okay. All right. Roxi, come on.
Come on, Roxi.

614
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:03,150
Come on. Okay.

615
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:05,960
You, up there.

616
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:35,149
Come on, party's over. Let's go.

617
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:39,029
Dora?

618
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:43,639
Perfect. Hey, Dora, come on. Wake up.

619
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:47,951
Wake up. I don't believe
in sleeping together on the first date.

620
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:50,315
Especially one you didn't show up for.

621
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:51,955
Come on.

622
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:54,435
Dora?

623
00:43:56,920 --> 00:43:59,070
Come on, Dora, wake up. Please.

624
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:06,479
All right, I got you. Come on. Let's go.

625
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:19,557
I'm sorry, that's all I got.

626
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:24,157
- What's her name?
- Dora Diamond.

627
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:26,674
- How long has she been unconscious?
- I don't know.

628
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:29,479
- What drugs she ingested?
- All I found was beer cans.

629
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:30,879
- Are you a relative?
- No.

630
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:32,996
I found her like that.
My friends had a party.

631
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:34,149
Nice party.

632
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:37,636
<i>I got to put my glasses on because</i>
<i>it looks like hair growing there.</i>

633
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:40,188
<i>And all Ron does is spray this.</i>

634
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:43,116
Going bald sucks.

635
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:45,830
They say it comes from your mother.

636
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:49,630
- My mother's got hair, you know.
- Of course she does.

637
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:53,998
- Is she okay?
- She's stable.

638
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:55,957
We pumped her stomach just to be sure.

639
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:59,350
If she took Rohypnol,
she'll be out for another eight hours.

640
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:01,789
The problem is,
on her student emergency card...

641
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:04,553
...she has Professor Alcott
as her next of kin.

642
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:08,474
You wouldn't happen to know
where her parents are or if she's insured?

643
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:10,910
No, I don't know.

644
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:13,038
Did you call Professor Alcott?

645
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:15,634
He doesn't know her.
And we can't keep her here.

646
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:18,109
I can take her. I'm her boyfriend.

647
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:23,630
- I thought you just found her like this.
- Yeah, I did. And boy, was I angry.

648
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:26,755
Okay.

649
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:29,517
Just fill this prescription.

650
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:05,075
Am I a man of my word or what?

651
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:08,313
- What the heck went on here?
- I came by to help clean up.

652
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:10,709
I suppose you don't have
any idea about Dora.

653
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:12,028
No, who is that?

654
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:14,475
The girl who almost had
an OD in the bathroom.

655
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:15,879
- She almost OD'd?
- Yeah.

656
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:18,520
I found her passed out
and took her to the hospital.

657
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:20,875
Shut up. All right. Where is she?

658
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:23,755
Man, what kind of drugs
were you giving out here?

659
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:26,400
Drugs? Man, all we had was beer.

660
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:28,432
You can't pass out from beer.

661
00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:31,398
You can, if you take something
before you drink it.

662
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:33,839
Her?

663
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:36,915
What do you mean, "Her?"

664
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:42,720
Adam found her at a liquor store
looking for a party.

665
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:44,870
Last time I saw her she was all over Noah.

666
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:47,269
Who knows
what she took before she got here.

667
00:46:47,360 --> 00:46:48,395
It's impossible.

668
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:51,233
Why is that impossible?
These are bridge and tunnel girls.

669
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:53,629
They sleep around to avoid the commute.

670
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:57,190
We were going to the concert.

671
00:46:58,520 --> 00:47:00,112
She never showed up.

672
00:47:01,720 --> 00:47:04,917
Come here.
I'm going to help you out with this, okay?

673
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,070
Look. All right.

674
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:09,791
We're going do this again next Friday.

675
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:13,634
I'll hook you up with a nice girl.
The kind of girl that you deserve.

676
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:15,679
What will we do with her?

677
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:18,752
She just has to sleep it off,
rest a couple of days.

678
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:21,994
- Okay, what about her parents?
- I don't know.

679
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:25,630
She put Professor Alcott
as her in-case-of-emergency person.

680
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:27,559
What's that all about?

681
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:29,594
I don't know.

682
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:33,118
I'm getting out of here.

683
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:37,637
- You'll call me if you need anything.
- Yeah, sure.

684
00:47:58,600 --> 00:48:02,388
You can't sleep while you tan.
Look at you. You're all burnt.

685
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:04,710
The tan is underneath. I have many layers.

686
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:08,349
- What's this genius plan you've devised?
- Okay, listen to this.

687
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:11,159
We figure out which class
we're doing worst in and drop it.

688
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:15,836
Then we transfer into European Lit 101,
but it has to be Professor Alcott's class.

689
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:18,151
We dump a D and transplant it with an A.

690
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:21,471
And why is Alcott
suddenly giving us all A's?

691
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:22,954
I'll make him an offer he can't refuse.

692
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:28,070
All right. Quiet, you guys.

693
00:48:28,520 --> 00:48:29,396
Hi.

694
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:31,829
Good morning.

695
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:35,640
- How long have I been asleep?
- Since Friday night.

696
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:37,877
Oh, my God.

697
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:41,789
- I've been in your bed and everything.
- It's no problem.

698
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:45,360
- Can I ask you something?
- Yeah. Sure.

699
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:48,318
- Are you on any special medication?
- No.

700
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:51,748
- Did you have a lot to drink?
- No.

701
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:55,955
I was at a convenience store
applying for the night shift job.

702
00:48:56,680 --> 00:48:59,592
There was a guy who told me
about a fundraiser he was having.

703
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:03,878
And he brought me back here.
I drank some juice.

704
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:06,635
I don't really remember much after that.

705
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:09,428
I think somebody
slipped me a roofie or something.

706
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:16,432
Boy, I have got to stop trusting people.

707
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:22,155
You want some lunch? Yeah, you do.

708
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:25,869
You haven't eaten in days.
I'm starving and I ate this morning.

709
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:30,553
When you took me to the hospital,
did they call anybody to come get me?

710
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:32,668
No.

711
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:35,399
They said you could go home
and rest a couple of days...

712
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:39,314
...and drink plenty of liquids.
And you need to take these.

713
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:41,869
Charcoal?

714
00:49:43,160 --> 00:49:45,549
So I can start a fire in your heart.

715
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:51,348
All right, that'll be ready in just a minute.

716
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:55,189
You just lie back and veg,
as you young people say.

717
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:59,594
And I'll read <i>The Plague</i>
so we don't behind in Lit class.

718
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:04,995
You know, I don't know about you,
but I really need a B+ in Alcott's class.

719
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,036
Alcott hates neediness.

720
00:50:09,320 --> 00:50:10,878
You know how old he is?

721
00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:14,197
He's only 34 and he's been
a full professor for almost 10 years.

722
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:17,273
He was the youngest
in the history of the university.

723
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:19,191
Is that going to be on the final?

724
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:22,557
I'm sorry. I should have told you
that he was my boyfriend.

725
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:25,550
We've been together all semester.

726
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:29,276
I wish they would've called him
instead of causing you all this trouble.

727
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:35,078
It's no trouble. I enjoy having you here.

728
00:50:36,120 --> 00:50:38,111
Yeah, but I've been asleep.

729
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:43,192
I guess it's a good thing
I'm easily amused, right?

730
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:45,438
Why are you so nice?

731
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:49,869
I don't know.

732
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:52,114
Hey, buddy.

733
00:50:52,320 --> 00:50:53,469
Yo. 420, later.

734
00:50:53,640 --> 00:50:56,837
Yo, going to see you Friday, right?
All right.

735
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:02,750
Professor Alcott.
I need to talk to you about Dora.

736
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:06,914
I'll cut you the same deal
as I cut the others.

737
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:12,152
Sir, the thing is, she's at my place
and she had her stomach pumped...

738
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:15,557
...because she was given some drugs
and she's been sick all weekend.

739
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:18,234
Her file lists you
as her in-case-of emergency person...

740
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:19,469
Look...

741
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:21,436
Paul.

742
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:25,798
Miss Diamond has kind of like this
schoolgirl crush on me.

743
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:29,117
You know how they build these entire
relationships up in their head.

744
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:32,192
It's great of you to be concerned.

745
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:34,714
- Sir, you don't understand.
- No, I understand.

746
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:38,793
Okay, I understand. I get it. It's fine.
We'll work it out. Okay?

747
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:41,995
Sir.

748
00:51:59,000 --> 00:51:59,716
- Good girl.
- Good girl.

749
00:52:01,240 --> 00:52:03,879
- Hi.
- Thanks, Dora. I can finish up.

750
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:05,275
Good girl.

751
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:07,795
Come here. I got to show you something.

752
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:12,359
What do you think?

753
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:14,075
I like it.

754
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:18,832
Kind of institutional, yet post-Victorian.
Very nice.

755
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:21,192
Wait, but look.

756
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:24,270
She's pregnant. We've got to let her out.

757
00:52:24,360 --> 00:52:28,194
- She doesn't want to have them in here.
- She might run away, though.

758
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:31,956
But look at her. She's really unhappy.
She's got to find a safe spot.

759
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:34,591
Okay. Sure.

760
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:37,553
Come here, sweetie. There you go.

761
00:52:40,120 --> 00:52:42,076
I found these on your desk.

762
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:47,112
Oh, my God.

763
00:52:48,680 --> 00:52:50,272
It's almost not like him.

764
00:52:50,360 --> 00:52:53,750
I know he loves me,
but he's never committed to paper before.

765
00:52:56,720 --> 00:52:58,756
How can I ever thank you?

766
00:53:04,680 --> 00:53:08,195
- For what?
- For saving my life, for taking care of me.

767
00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:10,159
You've been amazing.

768
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:13,471
- Wait. Where are you going?
- I'm going home.

769
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:16,914
I feel better now
and I've got to look for a job.

770
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,673
I'm sure you want a good night's sleep
in your own bed.

771
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:24,550
No. I mean, if you stay tonight,
you can get an early start tomorrow.

772
00:53:25,240 --> 00:53:27,435
But I don't have any clean clothes.

773
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:30,319
Actually, I was just about to do a wash.

774
00:53:30,560 --> 00:53:34,189
We can both wear
my extra-fashionable laundry clothes.

775
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:37,678
What is this?

776
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:40,111
Mid-90s hip-hop for the heartland.

777
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:43,397
My mother tried to help me be cooler,
so she went to Sears, where...

778
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:46,119
...they take the guesswork out of
exposing underpants.

779
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:52,434
If this is all you have,
then I think we'd better do a wash.

780
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:54,039
I'll change in there.

781
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:02,792
I'm sorry.

782
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:05,678
I was looking for another bag
to put the laundry in.

783
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:07,318
- I'll get you...
- Yeah. Thanks.

784
00:54:07,720 --> 00:54:09,199
I'll get you a bag.

785
00:54:12,840 --> 00:54:14,193
You didn't get it from me.

786
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:16,794
<i>Then how did I get it?</i>
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

787
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:20,754
- Is it burning and itching?
<i>- What's going to happen?</i>

788
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:23,838
Is there some... Is there a discharge?

789
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:26,354
<i>Suddenly you know all about it, don't you?</i>

790
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:28,311
Don't people talk gross on cell phones?

791
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:32,234
You'd think they'd be embarrassed
to have private conversations in public.

792
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:34,880
- I hate people with cell phones.
- All of them?

793
00:54:35,120 --> 00:54:36,030
Yep.

794
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:39,357
I hate everyone in there because
can get the new Garbage CD.

795
00:54:39,560 --> 00:54:42,711
I hate them because they can eat
whatever they want to eat.

796
00:54:42,920 --> 00:54:44,956
I hate anyone who has time to study.

797
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:49,789
- You hate a lot of people.
- I'm a rotten, nasty little person.

798
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:52,031
- No, you're not.
- Yes, I am.

799
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:55,039
Not having any money isn't ennobling.
It makes you mean.

800
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:59,432
Yeah, I get it. That's why
all the really nice people are rich.

801
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:04,035
- So who do you hate?
- No one.

802
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:07,029
Really?

803
00:55:08,520 --> 00:55:09,475
Yeah.

804
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:12,717
I wish I could be more like you.

805
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:14,837
So how come you always wear that hat?

806
00:55:15,840 --> 00:55:19,310
'Cause something like 90% of your body
heat escapes through your head.

807
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:22,318
But you're not particularly attached to it,
are you?

808
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,353
No. Not really.

809
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:27,396
Why?

810
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:29,152
- Come on.
- What?

811
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:39,237
- These belong to someone.
- No one who needs them more than you.

812
00:55:39,320 --> 00:55:40,719
Howdy, Miss Dora.

813
00:55:42,360 --> 00:55:44,351
Wait, here. Try this.

814
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:50,480
- Yeah. Yeah, that's the one.
- Yeah.

815
00:55:50,560 --> 00:55:51,709
Really?

816
00:55:52,680 --> 00:55:53,908
Okay.

817
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:56,795
Should I leave this one here?

818
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,514
No, leave it in the park
for a homeless person.

819
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:03,752
- After you.
- Well, thank you.

820
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:05,473
Honey, I'm home.

821
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:08,273
- Who are you talking to?
- The dogs.

822
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:11,792
- What about the kitties?
- Kitties, I'm home.

823
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:17,599
It's moving. It's alive.

824
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:19,472
Come on, we have to hurry.

825
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:23,233
Here, put it on the heating pad.

826
00:56:23,960 --> 00:56:26,155
And get some gloves, okay?

827
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:32,279
I can't let it pick up our scent,
otherwise the mother will reject it.

828
00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:35,393
- Oh, no.
- So we have to carefully...

829
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:39,792
...cut it out of its membrane.
What I need you to do...

830
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:41,953
Okay. Ready.

831
00:56:42,120 --> 00:56:44,793
- Okay, hold...
- God, be careful.

832
00:56:45,240 --> 00:56:47,390
- Don't poke it.
- Don't worry.

833
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:49,074
- Hold that...
- Okay.

834
00:56:49,160 --> 00:56:52,072
...for me right like that, okay? You got it?
- Yeah.

835
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:54,830
- I'll cut the membrane.
- Be careful.

836
00:56:54,920 --> 00:56:56,990
We'll get this little guy out, okay?

837
00:56:57,280 --> 00:56:58,872
Watch the head.

838
00:56:59,800 --> 00:57:01,199
Watching it.

839
00:57:01,560 --> 00:57:03,596
- Okay.
- Be careful.

840
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:06,395
- Pull it back.
- All right, I'm almost there.

841
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:08,038
- You got it?
- All right. Yeah.

842
00:57:08,120 --> 00:57:10,998
All right, I'm just going to cut
right underneath there.

843
00:57:11,080 --> 00:57:12,593
And, okay.

844
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:14,234
Here we go.

845
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:18,830
- Here he comes.
- Look at the head. It's so cute.

846
00:57:19,160 --> 00:57:21,276
- Is it alive?
- Yeah. It's alive.

847
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:22,669
Let's go.

848
00:57:26,920 --> 00:57:28,239
Let's see.

849
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:30,711
Here. Come on.

850
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:32,359
Come on.

851
00:57:33,320 --> 00:57:34,514
Now what?

852
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:38,515
We'll just keep it warm
and we'll try again in a few minutes.

853
00:57:38,680 --> 00:57:41,831
I always wanted a kitty,
but my mom was allergic.

854
00:57:42,680 --> 00:57:44,511
I wasn't allowed to have pets.

855
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:46,875
My girlfriend, Janet, she had a Siamese.

856
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:48,314
You have a girlfriend?

857
00:57:48,440 --> 00:57:50,715
Ex-girlfriend. We dated in high school.

858
00:57:51,160 --> 00:57:53,037
- Do you still see her?
- No.

859
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:56,432
She lost weight over the summer
and dating a lot more now.

860
00:57:56,520 --> 00:57:58,112
You know how it goes.

861
00:57:59,120 --> 00:58:01,350
It sounds lame to someone in a love affair.

862
00:58:01,480 --> 00:58:05,359
- Relationship. Whatever it is.
- I don't even know what it is.

863
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:09,911
He thinks I'm too young or something,
so he doesn't want to have a relationship.

864
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:13,117
But then he says things like...

865
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:15,839
...how he feels
we're the same person inside and...

866
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:18,276
...if he was female, he'd be me.

867
00:58:18,760 --> 00:58:21,149
But he said he didn't want
a relationship with you.

868
00:58:21,240 --> 00:58:23,435
Yeah, and that he'd always love me.

869
00:58:23,720 --> 00:58:26,792
And he said he didn't want to be
in a relationship.

870
00:58:27,080 --> 00:58:28,798
Yeah. So?

871
00:58:29,120 --> 00:58:31,918
Well, sometimes when someone's
telling you something...

872
00:58:32,560 --> 00:58:34,551
...they're trying to tell you something.

873
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:37,552
Right. Like men know
what's good for them.

874
00:58:38,520 --> 00:58:41,478
- Should we try again?
- Yeah. Let's see.

875
00:58:43,360 --> 00:58:44,793
She's licking it.

876
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:47,589
Told you.

877
00:58:47,960 --> 00:58:49,075
What do we do now?

878
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:52,830
Get some sleep and I'll stay
to make sure she doesn't toss him out.

879
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:56,393
Thanks.

880
00:59:06,080 --> 00:59:09,072
Do you really need models of all sizes?
I'm only 5 ft 4 in.

881
00:59:09,160 --> 00:59:11,833
- That's not a problem.
- I don't have a portfolio.

882
00:59:12,080 --> 00:59:14,469
We'll take your pictures free of charge.

883
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:17,439
What? I don't get paid for the pictures?

884
00:59:17,800 --> 00:59:22,112
This is an agency. We'll send 'em out
and hopefully somebody will bite.

885
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:24,596
You can take your clothes off in there.

886
00:59:30,320 --> 00:59:32,959
What makes you
so interested in lithography?

887
00:59:33,160 --> 00:59:35,628
I've always loved posters
and calendars and stuff.

888
00:59:35,960 --> 00:59:39,509
Especially the way the colors get put on
separately, then all come together.

889
00:59:39,600 --> 00:59:41,272
Are you in the union?

890
00:59:42,040 --> 00:59:44,918
It didn't say anything
about the union in the want ad.

891
00:59:45,120 --> 00:59:46,678
This is a union shop.

892
00:59:48,520 --> 00:59:52,399
- Hi, I'm calling for the gal Friday job.
<i>- The job's taken.</i>

893
01:00:02,320 --> 01:00:07,075
Hi, I'm calling about the ad
for healthy girls with good SAT scores.

894
01:00:07,560 --> 01:00:10,472
Is this for some sort of drug trial?

895
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:15,111
And what is the
foremost principle of banking?

896
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:17,550
Remembering your secret PIN number.

897
01:00:19,080 --> 01:00:22,390
Forgive me if I reserve my chuckles
for when I grade your final.

898
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:33,595
- Guess what?
- What?

899
01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:36,877
I won't have to leave school.
I'll have the money. I got a job.

900
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:38,712
- Doing what?
- Harvesting eggs.

901
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:41,398
- In New York?
- What?

902
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:44,358
You're going to be a farmer?

903
01:00:44,560 --> 01:00:45,675
No.

904
01:00:47,040 --> 01:00:50,112
I grow baby eggs and at the end
of my cycle they take them out...

905
01:00:50,200 --> 01:00:53,590
...and give them to infertile couples.
I get a shot every day.

906
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:56,559
I'll have enough money for tuition
and time to study...

907
01:00:56,640 --> 01:00:58,392
...and I'll get my mom a dishwasher.

908
01:00:58,480 --> 01:01:00,596
- What kind of shots?
- I don't know.

909
01:01:00,760 --> 01:01:02,990
Like hormones and girly stuff.

910
01:01:03,360 --> 01:01:06,193
- Let's celebrate, okay?
- I only have $30.

911
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:07,992
It's on me. Come on.

912
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:10,517
Wait. I'm a student member.

913
01:01:11,120 --> 01:01:15,875
I can come any time. It's always warm.
There's artsy films and the paintings rock.

914
01:01:16,200 --> 01:01:17,189
Thank you.

915
01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:21,318
You know what'd be fun?
If we pretend we're really rich...

916
01:01:21,520 --> 01:01:24,193
...and we can have
one painting from each room.

917
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:25,389
Okay.

918
01:01:30,920 --> 01:01:33,388
- That one.
- Puppies.

919
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:35,433
They're cute.

920
01:01:37,800 --> 01:01:39,074
This one.

921
01:01:48,920 --> 01:01:50,069
That.

922
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:52,439
This one.

923
01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:54,949
That? That's chick art.

924
01:01:55,040 --> 01:01:56,951
Then I suppose you like this one.

925
01:01:57,440 --> 01:01:59,670
As a matter of fact, yes.

926
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:02,075
What guy wouldn't like a plate of breasts?

927
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:04,675
What?

928
01:02:07,600 --> 01:02:09,989
- Are you hungry?
- I could eat.

929
01:02:13,800 --> 01:02:16,155
- Wait, isn't that steal...
- Come on.

930
01:02:29,960 --> 01:02:31,712
Isn't this totally pleasant?

931
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:35,476
This has been the best celebration.
Thank you for including me.

932
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:37,752
Ever been to a Broadway play?

933
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:40,675
No, but like I said, I only have $30.

934
01:02:40,760 --> 01:02:42,113
Don't worry about it.

935
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:44,035
Okay.

936
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:49,595
Here you go.

937
01:02:52,680 --> 01:02:55,433
You missed? Here, let's try again.
Here you go.

938
01:02:56,920 --> 01:02:58,911
- You get it? You missed?
- No.

939
01:03:03,720 --> 01:03:05,233
Don't they check the tickets?

940
01:03:05,320 --> 01:03:08,869
No. Just pretend like we were
out here for a smoke. Come on.

941
01:03:49,440 --> 01:03:51,317
How much money do you have left?

942
01:03:51,720 --> 01:03:54,598
$30. I can't believe
we didn't spend one cent.

943
01:03:54,960 --> 01:03:56,518
- Do you know why?
- Why?

944
01:03:56,760 --> 01:04:01,436
"The moon belongs to everyone

945
01:04:01,880 --> 01:04:05,509
"The best things in life are free"

946
01:04:06,760 --> 01:04:08,990
- Don't you get whimsical on me.
- Sorry.

947
01:04:09,080 --> 01:04:11,116
Where's the nasty girl
who hates everyone?

948
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:13,236
I don't know. I have fun with you.

949
01:04:14,280 --> 01:04:16,748
- What's that all about?
- I don't know.

950
01:04:19,640 --> 01:04:22,677
- Look at how good he looks.
- I know.

951
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:26,954
He's so happy.
He's resting with his brothers and sisters.

952
01:04:27,480 --> 01:04:30,756
You know,
we ought to start thinking about preschool.

953
01:04:31,160 --> 01:04:33,355
What time is it? I want to take the 11:50.

954
01:04:33,920 --> 01:04:36,229
Why don't you stay another night?

955
01:04:36,600 --> 01:04:39,592
You know, I'll just get a video and a pizza.

956
01:04:39,760 --> 01:04:41,990
It's better than waiting
on the train platform.

957
01:04:42,080 --> 01:04:44,753
- We'll just chill in.
- You mean chill out?

958
01:04:45,080 --> 01:04:46,479
Either one. Your choice.

959
01:04:47,040 --> 01:04:48,393
Yeah. Okay.

960
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:51,631
You call your mom,
I'll go get the video and the pizza.

961
01:04:52,640 --> 01:04:54,039
Don't you go anywhere.

962
01:05:07,640 --> 01:05:08,675
Thank you.

963
01:05:17,600 --> 01:05:19,795
Excuse me. Hello?

964
01:05:22,040 --> 01:05:23,758
- What's up?
- Hi.

965
01:05:25,720 --> 01:05:26,835
Okay.

966
01:05:27,360 --> 01:05:29,112
Of these two...

967
01:05:29,720 --> 01:05:31,915
...which would be good for me and...

968
01:05:32,120 --> 01:05:35,112
...you know, if I was watching alone
with a girl?

969
01:05:35,320 --> 01:05:36,958
Yeah. There you go.

970
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:40,152
<i>When Harry Met Sally</i>.

971
01:05:41,240 --> 01:05:44,516
Could you maintain a rod
and watch Billy Crystal at the same time?

972
01:05:45,880 --> 01:05:47,791
Don't feel bad. No one can.

973
01:05:48,680 --> 01:05:50,352
<i>The Piano.</i>

974
01:05:50,560 --> 01:05:53,233
I don't know. Full-frontal on Harvey Keitel.

975
01:05:53,600 --> 01:05:56,433
- Not good?
- No, that dude's a 90% wiener.

976
01:05:56,800 --> 01:05:59,553
- Really?
- Even on the small screen, that'll hurt you.

977
01:05:59,680 --> 01:06:00,908
Here's your winner:

978
01:06:01,160 --> 01:06:02,912
<i>Simon Birch</i>.

979
01:06:03,320 --> 01:06:07,313
About a little goofy kid with problems.
Can't go wrong, you'll look like a stud.

980
01:06:07,640 --> 01:06:10,791
And this is sexy?

981
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:12,831
Good for the girl?

982
01:06:13,080 --> 01:06:14,354
Yeah, works for me.

983
01:06:23,640 --> 01:06:24,755
Thank you.

984
01:06:28,920 --> 01:06:30,239
Honey, I'm home.

985
01:06:31,040 --> 01:06:34,077
It's so much better saying that
to an actual person.

986
01:06:34,280 --> 01:06:37,113
Do you think people said it before TV?

987
01:06:37,440 --> 01:06:40,637
- Hello, Paul.
- Hello, Professor Alcott.

988
01:06:43,080 --> 01:06:46,277
This has been the best day of my life.
Edward asked me to stay over.

989
01:06:46,520 --> 01:06:48,954
It's going to be so amazing.
Isn't that great?

990
01:06:51,720 --> 01:06:53,836
He must really respect you.

991
01:06:54,560 --> 01:06:56,869
Did he know you were in the hospital?

992
01:06:57,560 --> 01:06:59,516
I guess. He did get me those flowers.

993
01:07:00,960 --> 01:07:05,272
It's a relief, because the pressure's off.
Taking these fertility drugs...

994
01:07:05,400 --> 01:07:09,439
...gives me financial freedom,
so I won't be annoyingly needy.

995
01:07:09,720 --> 01:07:12,792
I may actually turn out to be
one of those lucky people.

996
01:07:14,560 --> 01:07:16,232
What lucky people?

997
01:07:16,440 --> 01:07:20,956
You know those couples that stay together
because they can't do any better?

998
01:07:21,120 --> 01:07:24,112
Or those people who are sad
and miserable and live alone?

999
01:07:24,440 --> 01:07:29,275
But then there's this microscopically
teeny group of lucky people...

1000
01:07:29,360 --> 01:07:32,318
...who get to be with the person
they're madly in love with.

1001
01:07:33,960 --> 01:07:38,351
You ever consider being in love
and leaving out the madly part?

1002
01:07:39,680 --> 01:07:41,591
What's the fun in that?

1003
01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:43,995
Dora, come on.

1004
01:07:49,480 --> 01:07:50,799
Take care of the baby.

1005
01:08:26,400 --> 01:08:28,311
How about some change, man?

1006
01:09:03,360 --> 01:09:05,271
No, I mean that in a good way.

1007
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:15,989
<i>And don't forget my Somalian beans.</i>

1008
01:09:16,200 --> 01:09:17,553
They don't have Somalian.

1009
01:09:17,760 --> 01:09:19,876
- Can I just get Italian?
<i>- All right.</i>

1010
01:09:24,880 --> 01:09:26,791
You sat so far away yesterday.

1011
01:09:29,240 --> 01:09:30,912
I thought you hate cell phones.

1012
01:09:32,320 --> 01:09:34,709
It's digital. Edward got it for me.

1013
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:37,513
I miss you guys.

1014
01:09:39,280 --> 01:09:43,353
You know, Taxi, Roxi, Penny and the baby.
Is he eating solids yet?

1015
01:09:44,440 --> 01:09:45,634
Kitten Chow.

1016
01:09:49,360 --> 01:09:52,875
I printed this up for you.
It's about those fertility drugs.

1017
01:09:53,320 --> 01:09:55,390
Hormones that make you
produce more eggs...

1018
01:09:55,480 --> 01:09:57,835
...also make cancer cells grow faster.

1019
01:09:58,320 --> 01:10:00,038
You should take a look at it.

1020
01:10:00,320 --> 01:10:02,709
- You looked this up for me?
- No.

1021
01:10:03,320 --> 01:10:06,869
I came across it when I was doing
some research, so I thought...

1022
01:10:07,880 --> 01:10:09,552
Do you like Monty Python?

1023
01:10:10,760 --> 01:10:12,910
The film school is having a series...

1024
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:17,911
- Hello?
<i>- I think I'll do a dessert.</i>

1025
01:10:18,360 --> 01:10:20,590
<i>- Like a biscotti.</i>
- With nuts?

1026
01:10:21,240 --> 01:10:22,878
<i>Yeah, it'll be great.</i>

1027
01:10:22,960 --> 01:10:24,632
- I'll be right back.
<i>- Hurry.</i>

1028
01:10:24,720 --> 01:10:25,709
Bye.

1029
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:30,879
So anyway, I was thinking of going,
and if you're free...

1030
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:32,638
I really don't have any time.

1031
01:10:32,880 --> 01:10:35,440
If I let my grades fall, I'm out of here.

1032
01:10:35,640 --> 01:10:37,790
I didn't get much work done last week.

1033
01:10:38,280 --> 01:10:40,794
- I'm sorry.
- It's not your fault.

1034
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,639
I'm under a lot of pressure, you know?

1035
01:10:45,080 --> 01:10:46,115
Right.

1036
01:10:46,200 --> 01:10:49,078
- Lf you change your mind...
- Yeah, okay.

1037
01:10:50,640 --> 01:10:52,517
- Bye.
- Bye.

1038
01:11:10,320 --> 01:11:12,436
Isn't it great how comfortable this is?

1039
01:11:12,640 --> 01:11:16,235
I have this feeling of bliss.
Do you feel it too?

1040
01:11:16,320 --> 01:11:18,356
What changed your mind
about me being here?

1041
01:11:18,440 --> 01:11:22,069
Can we turn down the intensity
just a notch?

1042
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:25,758
I was thinking how beautiful you looked
while you were quiet.

1043
01:11:28,560 --> 01:11:29,675
Okay.

1044
01:11:32,560 --> 01:11:34,232
What did you want to say?

1045
01:11:34,720 --> 01:11:38,793
I wondered what made you change
your mind about me being here.

1046
01:11:39,120 --> 01:11:41,793
I figured as long as I suffered
the consequences...

1047
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:43,911
...I may as well have you here mending.

1048
01:11:44,720 --> 01:11:46,631
Suffer what consequences?

1049
01:11:46,840 --> 01:11:51,197
As you probably know, I'm listed as
your next-of-kin on your medical records.

1050
01:11:51,440 --> 01:11:54,750
- I wanted to talk to you about that.
- I don't want to discuss it.

1051
01:11:54,840 --> 01:11:57,229
Your fraternity buddies
want to spread the word...

1052
01:11:57,320 --> 01:12:01,029
...of a student-professor affair,
date-rape, medication and stomach-pumps.

1053
01:12:01,120 --> 01:12:04,078
- Would you make me a cup of tea?
- Yeah.

1054
01:12:06,320 --> 01:12:08,629
- But I was drugged.
- Oh, it's fine.

1055
01:12:08,720 --> 01:12:11,871
They've agreed to silence
in exchange for A's in Lit.

1056
01:12:12,800 --> 01:12:16,952
Plunge the tea bag four to six times,
remove it and squeeze in a half a lemon.

1057
01:12:17,280 --> 01:12:19,271
And two and a half teaspoons of sugar.

1058
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:22,711
Paul had nothing to do with it, right?

1059
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:26,714
Paul, Adam, Chris, Noah.
They're all my little honor students.

1060
01:12:26,880 --> 01:12:30,634
Bet they couldn't get through a copy
of <i>Rolling Stone</i> between the four of them.

1061
01:12:31,280 --> 01:12:32,474
Here.

1062
01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:35,712
Not in a mug.
It needs to be in a cup with a saucer.

1063
01:12:37,600 --> 01:12:38,589
Please.

1064
01:12:40,800 --> 01:12:44,952
So they all came to you together
and blackmailed you?

1065
01:12:45,760 --> 01:12:47,079
I'm reading now.

1066
01:12:52,640 --> 01:12:55,712
Dora, Dora, hold up. Wait, wait.

1067
01:12:56,120 --> 01:12:58,793
- You've been an inspiration to us.
- What?

1068
01:12:58,880 --> 01:13:00,996
We got this killer scheme.
We want you in.

1069
01:13:01,080 --> 01:13:04,277
- It was Chris' idea.
- It would help us if we got a girl.

1070
01:13:04,480 --> 01:13:06,038
What are you talking about?

1071
01:13:06,120 --> 01:13:09,556
This spring, when we plan our programs,
we want to target...

1072
01:13:09,800 --> 01:13:11,950
...professors that are single, lonely.

1073
01:13:12,040 --> 01:13:14,395
For us, women, for you, men,
for more choices.

1074
01:13:14,480 --> 01:13:15,799
You know the drill after.

1075
01:13:15,880 --> 01:13:19,316
Once they're romantically interested,
you hint you're legally underage.

1076
01:13:19,440 --> 01:13:20,395
It's genius!

1077
01:13:20,600 --> 01:13:25,037
Meanwhile, we all get fake IDs,
except instead of being 21, we're only 17.

1078
01:13:25,120 --> 01:13:28,396
- See where we're going with this?
- Imagine how high your GPA will be.

1079
01:13:28,560 --> 01:13:30,915
Just coordinate your schedule with us.

1080
01:13:31,400 --> 01:13:32,674
You guys are amazing.

1081
01:13:33,800 --> 01:13:35,074
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1082
01:13:35,920 --> 01:13:38,957
- Thank you. All right, she's in.
- She's in. She's in.

1083
01:13:42,240 --> 01:13:45,994
There you go again with those books.
What is that?

1084
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:48,069
Studying?

1085
01:13:48,760 --> 01:13:51,069
Good one, man. Don't forget about Friday.

1086
01:13:51,400 --> 01:13:55,188
What, you didn't raise enough money
at your last fundraiser?

1087
01:13:55,400 --> 01:13:57,709
We barely made enough to cover the beer.

1088
01:13:57,800 --> 01:14:00,837
But I got it in check. I scored some rope.

1089
01:14:01,320 --> 01:14:04,915
Normally, chicks can drink six
to seven cans and they don't feel it.

1090
01:14:05,200 --> 01:14:08,829
But these bad boys, one, and you're done.

1091
01:14:09,840 --> 01:14:11,068
Careful.

1092
01:14:12,280 --> 01:14:13,554
Thanks, dude.

1093
01:14:13,960 --> 01:14:15,154
So, Friday.

1094
01:14:25,240 --> 01:14:26,309
Can I help you?

1095
01:14:26,520 --> 01:14:29,751
I'm looking for white pills that come
in a pop-out package.

1096
01:14:29,960 --> 01:14:32,155
We have aspirin in bubble pack.

1097
01:14:32,360 --> 01:14:36,194
These have writing on them.
I'm looking for pills without the writing.

1098
01:14:36,400 --> 01:14:37,799
There's this.

1099
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:42,194
- What do they do?
- Pretty much nothing.

1100
01:14:42,720 --> 01:14:45,678
- Any harmful side effects?
- Might make you a bit smarter.

1101
01:14:49,360 --> 01:14:51,954
Oh, my God. Are you guys taking Psych?

1102
01:14:53,440 --> 01:14:55,829
- Did you ever look in the book?
- No.

1103
01:14:56,760 --> 01:14:58,273
Look at this retard.

1104
01:15:01,800 --> 01:15:05,759
- What's cracking?
- I left some books in the closet.

1105
01:15:05,960 --> 01:15:09,111
- You mind if I get them?
- Of course not. Want a beer?

1106
01:15:09,320 --> 01:15:11,151
Ever heard of autism?

1107
01:15:11,320 --> 01:15:14,392
Are we still on for the shelter on Friday?

1108
01:15:15,880 --> 01:15:20,112
I heard they might be painting the place
on Friday. I'll have to find out.

1109
01:15:20,280 --> 01:15:22,999
See what you can do.
Otherwise we're up shit creek.

1110
01:15:23,240 --> 01:15:24,150
Okay.

1111
01:15:24,240 --> 01:15:26,800
Help us out, Paul.
It costs a lot to rent a bar.

1112
01:15:28,640 --> 01:15:30,596
- Thanks, guys.
- Thanks, buddy.

1113
01:15:30,680 --> 01:15:32,750
Don't be a stranger now, buddy, okay?

1114
01:15:40,440 --> 01:15:42,078
Put your pants on.

1115
01:15:42,240 --> 01:15:43,593
Cover that up.

1116
01:15:45,920 --> 01:15:50,630
No need to argue, plenty for everyone.
Just line up in an orderly fashion.

1117
01:15:50,720 --> 01:15:52,836
That looks like a penis, but smaller.

1118
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:55,556
Don't knock it till you tried it.

1119
01:15:55,800 --> 01:15:58,268
You got two minutes to cover it or lose it.

1120
01:16:02,320 --> 01:16:05,118
- This sucks.
- I would've said "blows."

1121
01:16:05,360 --> 01:16:08,113
Look at Kelly and Gwen.
I slipped them rope an hour ago.

1122
01:16:08,200 --> 01:16:10,475
I gave one to Shelly and look at that.

1123
01:16:11,120 --> 01:16:13,918
Maybe girls are developing an immunity...

1124
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,594
...the way pesticides don't work
on a lot of bugs.

1125
01:16:16,680 --> 01:16:19,035
- Look how amped these chicks are.
- Great.

1126
01:16:19,960 --> 01:16:22,872
If this doesn't work,
we'll have to rely on our charm.

1127
01:16:25,120 --> 01:16:28,999
- That stuff you got was useless.
- You still owe me $150.

1128
01:16:29,320 --> 01:16:32,118
The stuff I had had writing on the package.

1129
01:16:32,280 --> 01:16:33,872
What are you talking about?

1130
01:16:34,160 --> 01:16:35,479
This isn't them.

1131
01:16:37,880 --> 01:16:41,350
- Someone snagged our rope?
- Who knows where I keep my stash?

1132
01:16:44,760 --> 01:16:47,228
- Paul.
- Weak.

1133
01:16:50,960 --> 01:16:53,269
Do you see what's wrong with this?

1134
01:16:53,800 --> 01:16:56,109
The Greeks use a column
to hold something up.

1135
01:16:56,280 --> 01:16:59,397
Form follows function,
and it's beautiful in its simplicity.

1136
01:17:00,120 --> 01:17:02,839
This Roman column is
incorporated into the wall.

1137
01:17:02,920 --> 01:17:06,390
I assume from your mocking tone
you have an opposing viewpoint?

1138
01:17:07,440 --> 01:17:12,560
No. But don't you ever like
looking around because it's pretty?

1139
01:17:12,640 --> 01:17:13,789
Pretty?

1140
01:17:13,920 --> 01:17:17,230
- Not everything needs a lecture.
- Christmas decorations are pretty.

1141
01:17:17,400 --> 01:17:19,709
The cast of <i>Friends</i> is pretty.

1142
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,878
This is a world-class museum.
You only get what you put into it.

1143
01:17:22,960 --> 01:17:23,949
Sorry.

1144
01:17:26,040 --> 01:17:28,076
Paul Tannek to see Professor Alcott.

1145
01:17:28,200 --> 01:17:31,272
- He's in a meeting. Have a seat.
- Great, thank you.

1146
01:17:37,840 --> 01:17:39,558
- Peter.
- Paul.

1147
01:17:40,560 --> 01:17:42,869
- Should we go inside?
- What can I do for you?

1148
01:17:43,080 --> 01:17:47,073
Dora left these, and I'm not sure
if she's supposed to take anymore...

1149
01:17:47,520 --> 01:17:49,238
Goodbye, Professor Alcott.

1150
01:17:49,440 --> 01:17:51,317
Thanks for helping, Kristen.

1151
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:55,513
Let's talk in here.

1152
01:17:56,480 --> 01:17:59,790
How is Miss Diamond?

1153
01:18:00,920 --> 01:18:04,435
You know Dora. A little goes a long way.

1154
01:18:04,800 --> 01:18:07,360
She's a sweet kid, though.
Keeps the place immaculate.

1155
01:18:09,360 --> 01:18:11,920
You're lucky.
She cares about you a great deal.

1156
01:18:12,760 --> 01:18:14,034
That's for you.

1157
01:18:14,840 --> 01:18:17,229
- What is this?
- Final exam.

1158
01:18:17,800 --> 01:18:20,439
- The final's a take-home test?
- For you it is.

1159
01:18:21,400 --> 01:18:23,595
That's the deal I worked out with Chris.

1160
01:18:23,680 --> 01:18:26,240
I gotta have something
to substantiate an A.

1161
01:18:26,840 --> 01:18:30,719
- What's the matter?
- I wasn't aware of a deal.

1162
01:18:31,600 --> 01:18:33,716
I guess it's a good thing you dropped by.

1163
01:18:35,800 --> 01:18:37,995
Sir, if it's all the same, I'd rather not.

1164
01:18:38,760 --> 01:18:41,228
Are you planning
on saying anything to the dean?

1165
01:18:42,880 --> 01:18:43,949
No.

1166
01:18:44,760 --> 01:18:47,399
- You're going to tell Dora about Kristen?
- No. I'm not.

1167
01:18:48,440 --> 01:18:49,555
I don't understand.

1168
01:18:49,720 --> 01:18:51,870
Maybe I don't like the idea of being bought.

1169
01:18:51,960 --> 01:18:54,952
- You could lose your scholarship.
- I guess I could.

1170
01:18:55,840 --> 01:18:58,673
Is this a moral stand?
Is that what you're doing?

1171
01:18:58,800 --> 01:19:01,268
I gotta tell you,
I don't think that's very smart.

1172
01:19:01,960 --> 01:19:03,678
You know what?

1173
01:19:04,200 --> 01:19:06,270
I really don't give a fuck what you think!

1174
01:19:14,040 --> 01:19:15,189
What are you doing?

1175
01:19:15,400 --> 01:19:18,039
You stole over $200 of our medication!

1176
01:19:18,120 --> 01:19:20,554
You mean the illegal drugs
you disperse at parties?

1177
01:19:20,640 --> 01:19:23,518
Are you going to turn into a narc on us?

1178
01:19:23,640 --> 01:19:25,710
No. I want to be like the cool guys.

1179
01:19:25,960 --> 01:19:28,235
The guys who never go to class.

1180
01:19:28,320 --> 01:19:30,515
The guys who hit on girls
who are unconscious.

1181
01:19:31,080 --> 01:19:33,594
All the girls want you
when they're straight.

1182
01:19:34,080 --> 01:19:38,153
- You're with that Dora girl.
- What is that supposed to mean?

1183
01:19:38,720 --> 01:19:41,951
There's no velvet rope at Club Dora.
Any asshole can get in.

1184
01:19:45,800 --> 01:19:46,869
You okay?

1185
01:19:55,160 --> 01:19:57,390
Good Lord, I am so sorry. Come on.

1186
01:19:57,600 --> 01:20:00,433
- Are you okay?
- I'm all right.

1187
01:20:00,600 --> 01:20:03,353
Let's get that looked at. Come on.

1188
01:20:03,480 --> 01:20:05,152
Oh, great news.

1189
01:20:05,360 --> 01:20:06,349
What?

1190
01:20:06,560 --> 01:20:08,949
I know it vexes you
we never do anything together.

1191
01:20:09,040 --> 01:20:11,508
So I'm taking you to my parents'
for Thanksgiving.

1192
01:20:11,600 --> 01:20:14,319
- You told your parents about me?
- Yeah.

1193
01:20:14,880 --> 01:20:18,839
I told them my girlfriend's out of town
so I'm bringing my assistant.

1194
01:20:20,040 --> 01:20:21,473
But it'll be great.

1195
01:20:24,720 --> 01:20:26,233
- <i>Hello.</i>
- Hey, Dad.

1196
01:20:26,800 --> 01:20:28,756
Hey there, college boy!

1197
01:20:29,200 --> 01:20:31,395
What's the matter?
You sound a little blue.

1198
01:20:31,480 --> 01:20:32,629
<i>How's New York?</i>

1199
01:20:32,840 --> 01:20:35,798
It seems like this city is one big orgy.

1200
01:20:35,960 --> 01:20:38,997
And if you actually care about anyone,
you're a chump.

1201
01:20:39,160 --> 01:20:43,631
- I'll go, but which cleaners?
<i>- It's the one on</i> 8<i>th Street...</i>

1202
01:20:43,800 --> 01:20:45,119
Can you hear me?

1203
01:20:47,160 --> 01:20:49,833
<i>Sounds like things are rocky</i>
<i>with you and Dora.</i>

1204
01:20:51,160 --> 01:20:53,071
It's not like that, Dad.

1205
01:20:53,280 --> 01:20:55,840
I don't even think she knew
I liked her that way.

1206
01:20:56,520 --> 01:20:58,750
It was just so fun having her around.

1207
01:20:59,200 --> 01:21:00,269
I don't know.

1208
01:21:01,320 --> 01:21:02,799
Maybe I should come home.

1209
01:21:03,280 --> 01:21:04,793
I don't think I belong here.

1210
01:21:05,360 --> 01:21:09,558
At your age, you'll get your heart broken
no matter what city you live in.

1211
01:21:10,600 --> 01:21:11,999
Yeah. I guess.

1212
01:21:13,880 --> 01:21:15,313
I just miss her.

1213
01:21:24,040 --> 01:21:25,758
God, it's all so expensive.

1214
01:21:25,960 --> 01:21:28,758
"What we obtain too cheap,
we esteem too lightly."

1215
01:21:29,280 --> 01:21:30,508
Thomas Paine.

1216
01:21:32,720 --> 01:21:34,438
Why don't I make something to wear?

1217
01:21:36,520 --> 01:21:38,476
Maybe. Help, please.

1218
01:21:38,680 --> 01:21:42,036
If they think I'm your assistant,
I'll go as myself.

1219
01:21:42,240 --> 01:21:45,232
Dora, it's my parents.
I can't even go as myself.

1220
01:21:45,400 --> 01:21:47,391
That looks fabulous on.

1221
01:21:47,480 --> 01:21:48,959
I'll start a room for you.

1222
01:21:50,560 --> 01:21:52,835
I feel funny about you buying me an outfit.

1223
01:21:53,040 --> 01:21:55,315
Consider it a loan until you're wealthy.

1224
01:21:55,480 --> 01:21:56,879
The clothes, the haircut.

1225
01:21:56,960 --> 01:21:58,916
- A haircut?
- I made an appointment at Bliss.

1226
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:01,833
Just do a little shaping thing.

1227
01:22:03,480 --> 01:22:04,469
Okay.

1228
01:22:05,680 --> 01:22:06,669
Thanks.

1229
01:22:07,040 --> 01:22:09,190
Oh, thanks for the flowers.

1230
01:22:09,600 --> 01:22:10,794
What flowers?

1231
01:22:11,800 --> 01:22:14,553
The yellow flowers.
When I got my stomach...

1232
01:22:14,720 --> 01:22:15,948
Don't mention it.

1233
01:22:16,160 --> 01:22:18,628
- Those just came in.
- Thank you.

1234
01:22:18,840 --> 01:22:20,831
- Let's get started.
- Okay.

1235
01:22:36,400 --> 01:22:37,799
Beautiful there, huh?

1236
01:22:40,600 --> 01:22:45,276
Dora! We're going to a dinner,
not a fox hunt.

1237
01:22:47,320 --> 01:22:49,470
I just shouldn't go with you.

1238
01:22:50,280 --> 01:22:54,114
I'll take you to Calvin Klein.
Maybe they are more borough-friendly.

1239
01:22:56,600 --> 01:22:59,433
- I had a little scare today.
- What happened?

1240
01:22:59,560 --> 01:23:02,199
Dean Hackelman said
he wanted to talk to me.

1241
01:23:02,280 --> 01:23:04,157
I was afraid Paul had informed on us.

1242
01:23:05,400 --> 01:23:06,435
Why Paul?

1243
01:23:06,600 --> 01:23:10,195
My "special" students
got to take the final home.

1244
01:23:10,280 --> 01:23:13,795
Basically <i>carte blanche</i> to get an A,
and he wanted nothing to do with it.

1245
01:23:14,520 --> 01:23:16,750
I thought they were blackmailing you.

1246
01:23:16,840 --> 01:23:20,799
That's just it. Apparently he wasn't
in on it. It was just the others.

1247
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:23,912
He even gave me a discourse
on how he can't be bought.

1248
01:23:29,080 --> 01:23:32,038
- So what grade did you give him?
- B.

1249
01:23:32,640 --> 01:23:35,438
- Why didn't you give him a B+?
- It was a B paper.

1250
01:23:35,760 --> 01:23:37,159
Yeah, but his scholarship?

1251
01:23:37,320 --> 01:23:40,039
He wanted that whole fairness thing,
not me.

1252
01:23:49,240 --> 01:23:51,629
When we get to my parents, none of this...

1253
01:24:16,600 --> 01:24:17,589
Hello?

1254
01:24:27,480 --> 01:24:28,469
Come on in.

1255
01:24:31,560 --> 01:24:34,597
I came by to warn you that Alcott
was giving you a B.

1256
01:24:35,280 --> 01:24:40,274
I knew that was going to happen,
so I dropped his class.

1257
01:24:40,800 --> 01:24:43,951
I can take an extra credit
and keep my average up.

1258
01:24:44,280 --> 01:24:45,508
Great!

1259
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:48,353
You cut your hair.

1260
01:24:50,360 --> 01:24:53,716
Yeah, I did.
Got to keep up with the times, right?

1261
01:24:54,360 --> 01:24:57,397
I was kind of going for that...

1262
01:24:57,560 --> 01:25:01,872
..."George Clooney, my face is too cute
to hide behind my hair" look.

1263
01:25:03,360 --> 01:25:04,588
It looks good.

1264
01:25:05,120 --> 01:25:07,111
What's with the pizza?

1265
01:25:08,600 --> 01:25:11,910
I realized we never watched
that video you rented.

1266
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:15,993
So I got another one, and got a pizza
just in case you were hungry.

1267
01:25:16,440 --> 01:25:17,555
Look, Dora.

1268
01:25:20,040 --> 01:25:24,750
I can't just go around watching movies
and eating pizza with you.

1269
01:25:26,240 --> 01:25:27,753
Not that I don't want to.

1270
01:25:29,800 --> 01:25:32,758
You know, there's other stuff.

1271
01:25:32,920 --> 01:25:35,309
I know you're thinking,
"What about our stuff?"

1272
01:25:35,400 --> 01:25:37,994
And you're right. I miss it a lot.

1273
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:41,389
But I know Alcott is your boyfriend.

1274
01:25:41,840 --> 01:25:44,877
And to tell you the truth, I don't like him.

1275
01:25:46,600 --> 01:25:50,275
Not that that has anything to do
with how I feel about you.

1276
01:25:56,080 --> 01:25:58,548
It has a lot to do with how I feel about you.

1277
01:25:59,880 --> 01:26:01,950
That's why I can't have any pizza.

1278
01:26:04,440 --> 01:26:08,797
- Maybe I should try that again.
- Paul, he's not my boyfriend anymore.

1279
01:26:11,240 --> 01:26:13,674
Don't you want to be one
of those lucky people?

1280
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:15,876
I do! Don't you?

1281
01:26:18,360 --> 01:26:22,911
You can't waltz in here with your videos,
and looking all cute.

1282
01:26:23,800 --> 01:26:26,189
- Unless, unless...
- Unless what?

1283
01:26:26,360 --> 01:26:27,759
Unless you mean it.

1284
01:26:36,280 --> 01:26:37,429
What was that?

1285
01:26:38,560 --> 01:26:39,549
A kiss.

1286
01:26:40,280 --> 01:26:41,998
You call that a kiss?

1287
01:27:12,960 --> 01:27:16,430
A botched hairplug operation
caused Chris to lose his "good looks."

1288
01:27:16,560 --> 01:27:19,120
He hoped women would see
his other good qualities...

1289
01:27:19,200 --> 01:27:20,838
Except he has none.

1290
01:27:21,280 --> 01:27:23,430
Adam was recruited
by a large corporation

1291
01:27:23,560 --> 01:27:26,632
and setup to take a fall
for their shady practices...

1292
01:27:27,320 --> 01:27:31,950
He now has an active social life... in jail.

1293
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:37,630
Noah used himself as a guinea pig while
trying to create a stronger party drug.

1294
01:27:38,400 --> 01:27:41,358
He's currently relearning to tie his shoes.

1295
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:47,390
Professor Alcott is serving 3 to 5 years

1296
01:27:47,560 --> 01:27:50,233
for having an affair
with a seventeen year-old.

1297
01:27:51,440 --> 01:27:55,638
Dora used the animal hospital
as her residence and got financial aide.

1298
01:27:55,840 --> 01:27:58,274
She didn't have to sell her eggs.

1299
01:28:00,400 --> 01:28:02,436
Paul has first dibs on them.

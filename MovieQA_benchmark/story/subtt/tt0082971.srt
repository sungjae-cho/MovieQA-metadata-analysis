1
00:02:12,685 --> 00:02:14,687
The Hovitos are near.

2
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:18,232
The poison is still fresh,
three days.

3
00:02:18,357 --> 00:02:20,358
They're following us.

4
00:02:21,359 --> 00:02:26,238
If they knew we were here,
they would've killed us already.

5
00:03:50,058 --> 00:03:52,560
This is it.

6
00:03:52,644 --> 00:03:54,187
This is where Forrestal cashed in.

7
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:55,521
A friend of yours?

8
00:03:55,563 --> 00:03:56,522
A competitor.

9
00:03:56,564 --> 00:03:58,899
He was good.

10
00:03:58,941 --> 00:04:00,567
He was very, very good.

11
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:04,529
Señor... nobody's come out of there alive.

12
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:06,572
Please...

13
00:04:42,352 --> 00:04:44,812
Señor.

14
00:05:13,753 --> 00:05:15,004
Stop.

15
00:05:15,129 --> 00:05:17,131
Stay out of the light.

16
00:05:39,483 --> 00:05:41,901
Forrestal.

17
00:06:27,898 --> 00:06:31,568
Let us hurry.
There is nothing to fear here.

18
00:06:32,277 --> 00:06:34,695
That's what scares me.

19
00:06:53,336 --> 00:06:54,545
Stay here.

20
00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:56,672
If you insist, señor.

21
00:08:22,911 --> 00:08:24,120
Give me the whip.

22
00:08:24,162 --> 00:08:26,163
Throw me the idol.

23
00:08:27,873 --> 00:08:29,291
No time to argue.

24
00:08:29,374 --> 00:08:31,626
Throw me the idol,
I throw you the whip.

25
00:08:31,668 --> 00:08:33,127
Give me the whip.

26
00:08:33,253 --> 00:08:35,254
Adios, señor.

27
00:09:18,457 --> 00:09:20,459
Adios, Satipo.

28
00:09:59,449 --> 00:10:01,826
Dr. Jones.

29
00:10:01,868 --> 00:10:04,745
Again we see there is nothing
you can possess...

30
00:10:04,871 --> 00:10:06,455
...which I cannot take away.

31
00:10:06,497 --> 00:10:09,124
And you thought I had given up.

32
00:10:19,341 --> 00:10:21,843
You chose the wrong friends.

33
00:10:21,885 --> 00:10:24,262
This time, it will cost you.

34
00:10:26,138 --> 00:10:28,390
Too bad the Hovitos...

35
00:10:28,515 --> 00:10:31,726
...don't know you the way I do,
Belloq.

36
00:10:31,768 --> 00:10:33,353
Yes, too bad.

37
00:10:33,394 --> 00:10:35,605
You could warn them,

38
00:10:35,646 --> 00:10:38,273
if only you spoke Hovitos.

39
00:11:24,687 --> 00:11:26,439
Jock. Start the engines.

40
00:11:26,564 --> 00:11:28,565
Get it up.

41
00:11:32,152 --> 00:11:34,821
Jock, the engines.

42
00:11:34,946 --> 00:11:37,197
Start the engines, Jock.

43
00:12:25,863 --> 00:12:29,074
There's a big snake in the plane, Jock.

44
00:12:29,116 --> 00:12:31,951
Oh, that's just my pet snake Reggie.

45
00:12:31,993 --> 00:12:34,245
I hate snakes, Jock.

46
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:35,496
I hate 'em.

47
00:12:35,579 --> 00:12:38,957
Come on.
Show a little backbone, will ya?

48
00:12:54,512 --> 00:12:56,722
'Neo,' meaning 'new'

49
00:12:56,764 --> 00:13:00,392
and 'lithic'...I-T-H...

50
00:13:01,393 --> 00:13:03,144
...I- C, meaning 'stone.'

51
00:13:03,228 --> 00:13:04,854
All right, let's get back to this site:

52
00:13:04,896 --> 00:13:07,147
Turkdean Barrow, near Hazelton.

53
00:13:07,273 --> 00:13:12,402
Contains a central pas-passage
and three chambers, or cysts...

54
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:20,742
...don't confuse that with
robbing, in which case we mean...

55
00:13:20,867 --> 00:13:23,786
...the removal of the contents of the barrow.

56
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:26,414
This site also demonstrates...

57
00:13:27,414 --> 00:13:30,292
...one of the great dangers of archaeology...

58
00:13:30,417 --> 00:13:33,544
...not to life and limb, although
that does sometimes take place...

59
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:36,047
...no, I'm talking about folklore.

60
00:13:36,172 --> 00:13:37,798
In this case,
local tradition held...

61
00:13:37,923 --> 00:13:40,383
...that there was golden coffin
buried at the site,

62
00:13:40,509 --> 00:13:44,012
and this accounts for the holes
dug all over the barrow...

63
00:13:44,053 --> 00:13:46,931
...and the generally poor
condition of the find.

64
00:13:47,056 --> 00:13:49,933
However, chamber three was undisturbed,

65
00:13:50,058 --> 00:13:52,060
and the undisturbed chamber
and the grave goods...

66
00:13:52,143 --> 00:13:53,519
...that were found in another, uh...

67
00:13:53,561 --> 00:13:56,147
...in the area, give us a r...

68
00:13:57,398 --> 00:13:59,399
Uh...

69
00:14:00,192 --> 00:14:02,652
...reason to da...
to, uh, to-to date this,

70
00:14:02,694 --> 00:14:04,320
uh, find as we have.

71
00:14:04,445 --> 00:14:06,447
Um...

72
00:14:06,447 --> 00:14:08,449
Any questions, then?

73
00:14:08,449 --> 00:14:10,200
No? Okay, that's it for the day, then.

74
00:14:10,325 --> 00:14:11,576
Um, don't forget...

75
00:14:11,701 --> 00:14:16,539
Michaelson, chapters four
and five for next time.

76
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:21,418
And I will be in my office
on Thursday, but not Wednesday.

77
00:14:28,966 --> 00:14:30,717
I had it, Marcus.

78
00:14:30,842 --> 00:14:32,427
I had it in my hand.

79
00:14:32,552 --> 00:14:33,720
What happened?

80
00:14:33,845 --> 00:14:35,846
Guess.

81
00:14:36,722 --> 00:14:37,723
Belloq?

82
00:14:37,806 --> 00:14:38,849
You want to hear about it?

83
00:14:38,974 --> 00:14:40,350
Not at all.

84
00:14:40,434 --> 00:14:42,352
I'm sure everything you
do for the museum...

85
00:14:42,435 --> 00:14:44,103
...conforms to the International Treaty...

86
00:14:44,228 --> 00:14:45,563
...for the Protection of Antiquities.

87
00:14:45,605 --> 00:14:47,106
It's beautiful, Marcus.

88
00:14:47,231 --> 00:14:48,107
I can get it.

89
00:14:48,232 --> 00:14:49,233
I got it all figured out.

90
00:14:49,358 --> 00:14:50,859
There's only one place
he can sell it: Marrakech.

91
00:14:50,984 --> 00:14:52,068
I need $2,000. Look...

92
00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:53,069
Listen to me, old boy.

93
00:14:53,111 --> 00:14:54,487
I brought some people to see you.

94
00:14:54,612 --> 00:14:55,488
Look.

95
00:14:55,613 --> 00:14:56,697
I got these pieces.

96
00:14:56,739 --> 00:14:58,240
They're good pieces, Marcus.

97
00:14:58,365 --> 00:15:00,367
Look.
- Indiana...

98
00:15:00,492 --> 00:15:03,369
Yes, the museum will buy them,
as usual, no questions asked.

99
00:15:03,494 --> 00:15:04,996
Yes, they are nice.
They're worth at least...

100
00:15:05,121 --> 00:15:06,455
...the price of a ticket to Marrakech.

101
00:15:06,497 --> 00:15:07,706
But the people I brought are important,

102
00:15:07,748 --> 00:15:08,707
and they're waiting.

103
00:15:08,749 --> 00:15:09,708
What people?

104
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:11,626
Army Intelligence.

105
00:15:11,751 --> 00:15:13,211
They knew you were coming before I did.

106
00:15:13,253 --> 00:15:14,504
Seem to know everything.

107
00:15:14,629 --> 00:15:16,630
They wouldn't tell me what they want.

108
00:15:16,714 --> 00:15:19,132
Well, what do I want to see them for?

109
00:15:19,258 --> 00:15:20,759
What am I, in trouble?

110
00:15:20,842 --> 00:15:22,010
Yes, Dr. Jones,

111
00:15:22,135 --> 00:15:23,511
we've heard a great deal about you.

112
00:15:23,636 --> 00:15:25,388
Have you?

113
00:15:25,513 --> 00:15:27,640
Uh, professor of archaeology,

114
00:15:27,765 --> 00:15:29,224
expert on the occult,

115
00:15:29,266 --> 00:15:31,393
and, uh, how does one say it?

116
00:15:31,518 --> 00:15:34,145
Obtainer of rare antiquities.

117
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:35,146
That's one way of saying it.

118
00:15:35,271 --> 00:15:36,147
Why don't you sit down?

119
00:15:36,272 --> 00:15:37,147
You'll be more comfortable.

120
00:15:37,273 --> 00:15:38,232
Oh, thank you.
- Thank you.

121
00:15:38,273 --> 00:15:41,610
Yes, you're a man of many talents.

122
00:15:41,651 --> 00:15:44,028
Now, you studied
under Professor Ravenwood...

123
00:15:44,153 --> 00:15:45,780
...at the University of Chicago.

124
00:15:45,863 --> 00:15:47,865
Yes, I did.

125
00:15:47,906 --> 00:15:50,617
You have no idea
of his present whereabouts?

126
00:15:50,659 --> 00:15:53,870
Uh... well, just rumors, really.

127
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:55,538
Somewhere in Asia, I think.

128
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:57,289
I haven't really spoken to him for ten years.

129
00:15:57,414 --> 00:15:58,916
We were friends, but, uh...

130
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:01,918
...had a bit of a falling out,
I'm afraid.

131
00:16:02,002 --> 00:16:03,419
Mmm.

132
00:16:03,544 --> 00:16:06,172
Dr. Jones, now,
you must understand...

133
00:16:06,255 --> 00:16:09,258
...that this is all strictly confidential, eh?

134
00:16:09,299 --> 00:16:10,258
I understand.

135
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:12,427
Uh...

136
00:16:12,552 --> 00:16:16,055
Yesterday afternoon,
our European sections...

137
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:18,932
...intercepted a...
a German communiqué...

138
00:16:19,016 --> 00:16:22,060
...that was sent from Cairo to Berlin.

139
00:16:22,185 --> 00:16:23,936
Now, to Cairo...
- See, over the last two years,

140
00:16:24,062 --> 00:16:25,813
the Nazis have had teams
of archaeologists...

141
00:16:25,896 --> 00:16:26,939
...running around the world...

142
00:16:27,022 --> 00:16:30,192
...looking for all kinds of religious artifacts.

143
00:16:30,317 --> 00:16:31,568
Hitler's a nut on the subject.

144
00:16:31,693 --> 00:16:32,569
He's crazy.

145
00:16:32,694 --> 00:16:34,695
He's obsessed with the occult.

146
00:16:34,821 --> 00:16:36,697
And, right now, apparently,

147
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:39,074
there's some kind
of German archaeological dig...

148
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:40,575
...going on in the desert outside of Cairo.

149
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:42,827
Now, we've got some information here,

150
00:16:42,952 --> 00:16:45,454
but we can't make anything
out of it, and maybe you can.

151
00:16:45,579 --> 00:16:49,416
'Tanis development proceeding.

152
00:16:49,458 --> 00:16:53,711
'Acquire headpiece, Staff of Ra.

153
00:16:53,836 --> 00:16:57,172
Abner Ravenwood, U.S.'

154
00:16:57,214 --> 00:16:59,424
The Nazis have discovered Tanis.

155
00:16:59,549 --> 00:17:02,719
Just what does that mean to you,
uh, Tanis?

156
00:17:02,844 --> 00:17:03,803
Well, it...

157
00:17:03,845 --> 00:17:05,221
The city of Tanis is one of the possible...

158
00:17:05,346 --> 00:17:06,347
...resting places of the Lost Ark.

159
00:17:06,472 --> 00:17:08,098
The Lost Ark?

160
00:17:08,223 --> 00:17:09,433
Yeah, the Ark of the Covenant.

161
00:17:09,558 --> 00:17:10,559
The chest the Hebrews used...

162
00:17:10,684 --> 00:17:12,102
...to carry around the Ten Commandments.

163
00:17:12,227 --> 00:17:13,561
What do you mean,
'commandments'?

164
00:17:13,686 --> 00:17:14,979
You talking
about the Ten Commandments?

165
00:17:15,104 --> 00:17:16,605
Yes, the actual Ten Commandments.

166
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:17,940
The original stone tablets...

167
00:17:17,981 --> 00:17:20,692
...that Moses brought down
out of Mount Horeb and smashed,

168
00:17:20,734 --> 00:17:23,236
if you believe in that sort of thing.

169
00:17:23,361 --> 00:17:25,613
Any of you guys ever go to Sunday school?

170
00:17:25,738 --> 00:17:26,614
Well, I...

171
00:17:26,739 --> 00:17:27,740
Oh, look.

172
00:17:27,823 --> 00:17:29,366
The Hebrews took the broken pieces...

173
00:17:29,491 --> 00:17:30,617
...and put them in the Ark.

174
00:17:30,742 --> 00:17:31,993
When they settled in Canaan,

175
00:17:32,077 --> 00:17:34,579
they put the Ark in a place
called the Temple of Solomon.

176
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:35,579
In Jerusalem.

177
00:17:35,705 --> 00:17:37,248
Where it stayed for many years.

178
00:17:37,373 --> 00:17:39,708
Until, all of a sudden,
whoosh, it's gone.

179
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:40,709
Where?

180
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:42,627
Well, nobody knows where or when.

181
00:17:42,752 --> 00:17:44,587
However, an Egyptian pharaoh...

182
00:17:44,712 --> 00:17:45,713
Shishak.
- Yes.

183
00:17:45,755 --> 00:17:48,507
...invaded the city of Jerusalem
right about 980 BC,

184
00:17:48,632 --> 00:17:51,593
and he may have taken the Ark
back to the city of Tanis...

185
00:17:51,635 --> 00:17:53,594
...and hidden it in a secret chamber...

186
00:17:53,636 --> 00:17:55,137
...called the Well of Souls.

187
00:17:55,263 --> 00:17:56,597
Secret chamber?

188
00:17:56,639 --> 00:17:58,265
However, about a year...

189
00:17:58,348 --> 00:18:00,725
...after the pharaoh would return to Egypt,

190
00:18:00,767 --> 00:18:03,978
the city of Tanis was
consumed by the desert...

191
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:07,022
...in a sandstorm which lasted a whole year.

192
00:18:07,147 --> 00:18:09,900
Wiped clean by the wrath of God.

193
00:18:11,901 --> 00:18:12,861
Uh-huh.

194
00:18:12,902 --> 00:18:15,279
Obviously, we've come to the right men.

195
00:18:15,404 --> 00:18:16,906
Now you seem to know, uh,

196
00:18:17,031 --> 00:18:18,157
all about this Tanis, then.

197
00:18:18,282 --> 00:18:19,908
No, no, not really.

198
00:18:19,991 --> 00:18:22,535
Ravenwood is the real expert.

199
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:24,037
Abner did the first serious work on Tanis.

200
00:18:24,162 --> 00:18:26,664
Collected some of its relics.

201
00:18:26,789 --> 00:18:29,416
It was his obsession, really.

202
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:31,042
But he never found the city.

203
00:18:31,126 --> 00:18:34,504
Frankly, we're somewhat
suspicious of Mr. Ravenwood.

204
00:18:34,629 --> 00:18:36,172
An American being mentioned
so prominently...

205
00:18:36,297 --> 00:18:38,549
...in a secret Nazi cable.

206
00:18:38,632 --> 00:18:39,549
Oh, rubbish.

207
00:18:39,633 --> 00:18:40,926
Ravenwood's no Nazi.

208
00:18:41,009 --> 00:18:42,886
Well, what do the Nazis want him for, then?

209
00:18:42,927 --> 00:18:45,054
Well, obviously,
the Nazis are looking...

210
00:18:45,137 --> 00:18:47,056
...for the headpiece to the Staff of Ra...

211
00:18:47,181 --> 00:18:48,765
...and they think Abner's got it.

212
00:18:48,807 --> 00:18:52,268
What exactly is a headpiece
to the Staff of Ra?

213
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:53,686
Well, the staff is just a stick...

214
00:18:53,811 --> 00:18:55,021
I don't know, about this big,

215
00:18:55,062 --> 00:18:56,689
nobody really knows for sure how high...

216
00:18:56,814 --> 00:18:59,775
...and it's... it's, uh...
it's capped...

217
00:18:59,816 --> 00:19:02,527
...with an elaborate headpiece...

218
00:19:02,652 --> 00:19:05,655
...in the shape of the sun,
with a crystal in the center.

219
00:19:05,696 --> 00:19:07,323
And what you did was...

220
00:19:07,448 --> 00:19:09,825
...you take the staff
to a special room in Tanis...

221
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:11,326
...a map room with a miniature...

222
00:19:11,409 --> 00:19:13,077
...of the city all laid out on the floor...

223
00:19:13,203 --> 00:19:15,329
...and if you put the staff in a certain place,

224
00:19:15,454 --> 00:19:18,082
at a certain time of day,
the sun shone through here...

225
00:19:18,207 --> 00:19:21,084
...and made a beam that came down
on the floor here...

226
00:19:21,167 --> 00:19:25,046
...and gave you the exact location
of the Well of the Souls.

227
00:19:25,087 --> 00:19:27,965
Where the Ark of the Covenant
was kept, right?

228
00:19:28,090 --> 00:19:29,466
Which is exactly what the Nazis
are looking for.

229
00:19:29,591 --> 00:19:32,677
What does this Ark look like?

230
00:19:32,719 --> 00:19:34,095
Uh...

231
00:19:34,178 --> 00:19:37,181
There's a picture of it right here.

232
00:19:40,684 --> 00:19:42,602
That's it.

233
00:19:49,191 --> 00:19:50,317
Good God.

234
00:19:50,442 --> 00:19:52,861
Yes, that's just what the Hebrews thought.

235
00:19:52,944 --> 00:19:54,112
Uh...

236
00:19:54,195 --> 00:19:56,614
...now, what's that supposed to be
coming out of there?

237
00:19:56,739 --> 00:19:58,740
Lightning...

238
00:19:58,824 --> 00:20:00,826
...fire...

239
00:20:00,867 --> 00:20:03,328
...power of God or something.

240
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,871
I'm beginning to understand

241
00:20:05,955 --> 00:20:07,122
Hitler's interest in this.

242
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:08,832
Oh, yes.

243
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:10,750
The Bible speaks of the
Ark leveling mountains,

244
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:14,378
and laying waste to entire regions.

245
00:20:14,462 --> 00:20:18,507
An army which carries the Ark before it...

246
00:20:18,632 --> 00:20:20,634
...is invincible.

247
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:43,027
You did it, didn't you?

248
00:20:43,152 --> 00:20:44,612
They want you to go for it.

249
00:20:44,737 --> 00:20:47,156
Oh, Marcus.

250
00:20:47,156 --> 00:20:49,908
They want you to get ahold of
the Ark before the Nazis do...

251
00:20:49,991 --> 00:20:52,160
...and they're prepared
to pay handsomely for it.

252
00:20:52,243 --> 00:20:53,369
And the museum?

253
00:20:53,494 --> 00:20:54,745
The museum gets the Ark
when we're finished?

254
00:20:54,787 --> 00:20:56,789
Oh, yes.

255
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:00,250
Oh...

256
00:21:00,292 --> 00:21:02,794
The Ark of the Covenant.

257
00:21:02,919 --> 00:21:05,546
Nothing else has come close.

258
00:21:05,671 --> 00:21:07,047
That thing represents everything...

259
00:21:07,131 --> 00:21:10,509
...we got into archaeology
for in the first place.

260
00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:13,261
Mmm.

261
00:21:13,303 --> 00:21:16,263
You know, five years ago,
I would've gone after it myself.

262
00:21:16,388 --> 00:21:18,557
I'm really rather envious.

263
00:21:18,557 --> 00:21:19,933
I've got to locate Abner.

264
00:21:20,058 --> 00:21:22,560
I think I know where to start.

265
00:21:26,939 --> 00:21:29,066
Suppose she'll still be with him?

266
00:21:29,149 --> 00:21:30,442
Possibly, but...

267
00:21:30,567 --> 00:21:33,194
Marion's the least
of your worries right now,

268
00:21:33,278 --> 00:21:34,904
believe me, Indy.

269
00:21:34,946 --> 00:21:36,947
What do you mean?

270
00:21:37,072 --> 00:21:40,158
Well, I mean that for nearly 3,000 years,

271
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,952
man has been searching for the Lost Ark.

272
00:21:43,077 --> 00:21:47,915
Not something to be taken lightly.

273
00:21:47,956 --> 00:21:51,918
No one knows its secrets.

274
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:55,963
It's like nothing you've ever
gone after before.

275
00:21:56,672 --> 00:21:57,798
Oh, Marcus.

276
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,091
What are you trying to do,
scare me?

277
00:21:59,174 --> 00:22:00,092
You sound like my mother.

278
00:22:00,175 --> 00:22:01,551
We've known each other for a long time.

279
00:22:01,593 --> 00:22:02,552
I don't believe in magic,

280
00:22:02,594 --> 00:22:04,720
a lot of superstitious hocus-pocus.

281
00:22:04,804 --> 00:22:05,846
I'm going after a find...

282
00:22:05,971 --> 00:22:07,848
...of incredible historical significance.

283
00:22:07,973 --> 00:22:09,725
You're talking about the bogeyman.

284
00:22:09,808 --> 00:22:13,603
Besides, you know
what a cautious fellow I am.

285
00:22:23,611 --> 00:22:24,987
Nice to see you again,
Dr. Jones.

286
00:22:25,071 --> 00:22:27,072
Thank you.

287
00:23:39,633 --> 00:23:41,635
Shh... shh...

288
00:23:59,066 --> 00:24:01,067
Shh...

289
00:24:31,676 --> 00:24:33,594
Give him space.
Give him space.

290
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:35,721
Go on, Regan.

291
00:24:36,806 --> 00:24:39,224
Shh. Shh.

292
00:24:39,224 --> 00:24:41,226
Shh. Shh. Shh.

293
00:25:25,596 --> 00:25:27,848
Hello, Marion.

294
00:25:33,394 --> 00:25:36,522
Indiana Jones.

295
00:25:38,607 --> 00:25:40,150
Always knew, someday,

296
00:25:40,233 --> 00:25:42,610
you'd come walking back through my door.

297
00:25:42,652 --> 00:25:44,737
I never doubted that.

298
00:25:44,779 --> 00:25:47,031
Something made it inevitable.

299
00:25:47,156 --> 00:25:49,908
So, what are you doing here in Nepal?

300
00:25:50,033 --> 00:25:53,036
I need one of the pieces
your father collected.

301
00:25:53,161 --> 00:25:56,872
I learned to hate you in the last ten years.

302
00:25:56,914 --> 00:25:58,665
I never meant to hurt you.

303
00:25:58,790 --> 00:25:59,916
I was a child.

304
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,167
I was in love.

305
00:26:01,293 --> 00:26:03,044
It was wrong and you knew it.

306
00:26:03,169 --> 00:26:04,420
You knew what you were doing.

307
00:26:04,504 --> 00:26:05,004
Now I do.

308
00:26:05,129 --> 00:26:06,172
This is my place.

309
00:26:06,297 --> 00:26:08,298
Get out.

310
00:26:10,425 --> 00:26:11,384
I did what I did.

311
00:26:11,426 --> 00:26:12,802
You don't have to be happy about it,

312
00:26:12,927 --> 00:26:16,430
but maybe we could help
each other out now.

313
00:26:16,931 --> 00:26:18,932
I need one of the pieces
your father collected.

314
00:26:19,016 --> 00:26:20,183
Bronze piece, about this size,

315
00:26:20,308 --> 00:26:22,185
with a hole in it, off-center,
with a crystal.

316
00:26:22,268 --> 00:26:23,311
You know the one I mean?

317
00:26:23,436 --> 00:26:25,313
Yeah.

318
00:26:25,438 --> 00:26:26,647
I know it.

319
00:26:26,689 --> 00:26:28,690
Where's Abner?

320
00:26:28,816 --> 00:26:30,692
Where's Abner?

321
00:26:30,817 --> 00:26:32,819
Abner's dead.

322
00:26:37,323 --> 00:26:39,825
Marion, I'm sorry.

323
00:26:39,825 --> 00:26:42,785
Do you know what you did to me,
to my life?

324
00:26:42,827 --> 00:26:45,329
I can only say I'm sorry so many times.

325
00:26:45,413 --> 00:26:47,164
Well, say it again, anyway.

326
00:26:47,206 --> 00:26:48,207
Sorry.

327
00:26:48,332 --> 00:26:50,042
Yeah, everybody's sorry.

328
00:26:50,167 --> 00:26:52,961
Abner was sorry for dragging me
all over this earth...

329
00:26:53,044 --> 00:26:54,962
...looking for his little bits of junk.

330
00:26:55,087 --> 00:26:57,423
I'm sorry to still be stuck in this dive.

331
00:26:57,464 --> 00:27:00,092
Everybody's sorry for something.

332
00:27:00,217 --> 00:27:02,218
It's a worthless bronze medallion, Marion.

333
00:27:02,302 --> 00:27:03,469
You going to give it to me?

334
00:27:03,594 --> 00:27:04,595
Maybe.

335
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,472
I don't know where it is.

336
00:27:06,555 --> 00:27:09,975
Well, maybe you could find it.

337
00:27:10,058 --> 00:27:12,477
3,000 bucks.

338
00:27:12,602 --> 00:27:16,439
Well, that will get me back,
but not in style.

339
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:19,316
I can get you another two
when we get to the States.

340
00:27:19,358 --> 00:27:21,484
It's important, Marion.

341
00:27:21,610 --> 00:27:23,736
Trust me.

342
00:27:24,862 --> 00:27:26,739
You know the piece I mean?

343
00:27:26,864 --> 00:27:28,866
Do you know where it is?

344
00:27:31,868 --> 00:27:33,369
Come back tomorrow.

345
00:27:33,494 --> 00:27:35,621
Why?

346
00:27:35,705 --> 00:27:39,458
Because I said so, that's why.

347
00:27:46,005 --> 00:27:47,214
Ha.

348
00:27:47,256 --> 00:27:50,008
See you tomorrow, Indiana Jones.

349
00:28:57,189 --> 00:28:59,066
Good evening, Fraulein.

350
00:28:59,149 --> 00:29:01,276
The bar's closed.

351
00:29:01,318 --> 00:29:04,404
We... We are...

352
00:29:04,445 --> 00:29:06,447
...not thirsty.

353
00:29:06,447 --> 00:29:07,781
What do you want?

354
00:29:07,823 --> 00:29:10,784
The same thing your friend
Dr. Jones wanted.

355
00:29:10,909 --> 00:29:13,453
Surely he told you there would be...

356
00:29:13,536 --> 00:29:15,079
...other interested parties.

357
00:29:15,204 --> 00:29:17,706
Must've slipped his mind.

358
00:29:17,790 --> 00:29:21,418
The man is... nefarious.

359
00:29:21,459 --> 00:29:25,713
I hope, for your sake,
he has not yet acquired it.

360
00:29:25,796 --> 00:29:28,048
Why, are you willing to offer more?

361
00:29:28,090 --> 00:29:31,092
Oh, almost certainly.

362
00:29:31,092 --> 00:29:33,094
Do you still have it?

363
00:29:38,307 --> 00:29:40,100
No.

364
00:29:40,183 --> 00:29:42,977
But I know where it is.

365
00:29:44,187 --> 00:29:46,856
Hey, how about a drink
for you and your men?

366
00:29:46,981 --> 00:29:51,943
Your fire is dying here.

367
00:29:51,985 --> 00:29:54,737
Why don't you tell me
where the piece is right now?

368
00:29:54,821 --> 00:29:56,947
Listen, Herr Mac...

369
00:29:58,198 --> 00:30:01,701
I don't know what kind of people
you're used to dealing with,

370
00:30:01,826 --> 00:30:04,203
but nobody tells me what to do in my place.

371
00:30:04,328 --> 00:30:07,623
Fraulein Ravenwood,

372
00:30:07,748 --> 00:30:11,584
let me show you what I am used to.

373
00:30:13,628 --> 00:30:17,006
Take your hands off me.

374
00:30:18,882 --> 00:30:21,134
Take your lousy hands off.

375
00:30:27,389 --> 00:30:28,390
Wait a minute.

376
00:30:28,515 --> 00:30:29,766
Wait, I... I can be reasonable.

377
00:30:29,891 --> 00:30:32,143
That time is passed.

378
00:30:32,143 --> 00:30:34,145
You don't need that.

379
00:30:35,855 --> 00:30:37,856
Wait...

380
00:30:38,524 --> 00:30:40,025
I'll tell you everything.

381
00:30:40,150 --> 00:30:44,404
Yes, I know you will.

382
00:30:49,741 --> 00:30:51,743
Let her go.

383
00:32:06,222 --> 00:32:08,223
Whiskey.

384
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:17,731
Shoot them.

385
00:32:17,856 --> 00:32:19,858
Shoot them both.

386
00:33:14,153 --> 00:33:16,155
My medallion.

387
00:33:23,661 --> 00:33:26,122
Well, Jones, at least you haven't forgotten...

388
00:33:26,163 --> 00:33:27,998
...how to show a lady a good time.

389
00:33:28,123 --> 00:33:29,625
Boy, you're something.

390
00:33:29,666 --> 00:33:30,792
Yeah, I'll tell you what.

391
00:33:30,876 --> 00:33:32,794
Until I get back my $5,000,

392
00:33:32,877 --> 00:33:34,921
you're going to get more
than you bargained for.

393
00:33:35,046 --> 00:33:38,173
I'm your goddamn partner.

394
00:34:15,454 --> 00:34:17,706
Cairo, city of the living.

395
00:34:17,790 --> 00:34:19,791
A paradise on earth.

396
00:34:21,334 --> 00:34:22,460
Silence.

397
00:34:22,585 --> 00:34:24,087
Why do you forget yourselves?

398
00:34:24,212 --> 00:34:25,171
What is this?

399
00:34:25,213 --> 00:34:27,965
Where did this animal come from?

400
00:34:30,926 --> 00:34:32,927
Oh... oh, no.

401
00:34:34,554 --> 00:34:36,180
Cute.

402
00:34:36,222 --> 00:34:38,474
What an adorable creature.

403
00:34:40,225 --> 00:34:42,352
Then it shall be welcome in our house.

404
00:34:42,435 --> 00:34:47,815
Oh, well, no, you don't have to
keep it here just because of me.

405
00:34:53,111 --> 00:34:55,321
I knew the Germans would hire you, Sallah.

406
00:34:55,363 --> 00:34:57,448
You're the best digger in Egypt.

407
00:34:57,573 --> 00:35:01,117
My services are entirely
inconsequential to them.

408
00:35:01,243 --> 00:35:04,454
They've hired or shanghaied
every digger in Cairo.

409
00:35:04,579 --> 00:35:06,247
The excavation is enormous.

410
00:35:06,372 --> 00:35:10,250
They hire only strong backs
and they pay pennies for them.

411
00:35:10,375 --> 00:35:13,586
It's as if the pharaohs had returned.

412
00:35:13,628 --> 00:35:15,254
When did they find the map room?

413
00:35:15,338 --> 00:35:16,881
Three days ago.

414
00:35:17,006 --> 00:35:18,882
They have not one brain among them.

415
00:35:18,966 --> 00:35:21,259
Except one.

416
00:35:21,384 --> 00:35:25,263
He is very clever.
He's a French archaeologist.

417
00:35:25,513 --> 00:35:27,139
What's his name?

418
00:35:27,264 --> 00:35:29,266
They call him 'Bellosh.'

419
00:35:35,021 --> 00:35:37,898
Belloq. Belloq.

420
00:35:37,898 --> 00:35:40,734
The Germans have
a great advantage over us.

421
00:35:40,775 --> 00:35:43,986
They are near to discovering
the Well of Souls.

422
00:35:44,112 --> 00:35:48,407
Well, they're not
going to find it without this.

423
00:35:48,532 --> 00:35:51,660
Who can tell us about these markings?

424
00:35:54,037 --> 00:35:56,872
Perhaps a man I know can help us.

425
00:35:57,873 --> 00:35:59,875
Indy...

426
00:36:01,793 --> 00:36:03,920
...there is something that troubles me.

427
00:36:04,045 --> 00:36:07,047
What is it?

428
00:36:07,131 --> 00:36:09,132
The Ark.

429
00:36:09,174 --> 00:36:11,426
If it is there, at Tanis,

430
00:36:11,551 --> 00:36:14,804
then it is something that man
was not meant to disturb.

431
00:36:14,929 --> 00:36:17,931
Death has always surrounded it.

432
00:36:18,057 --> 00:36:20,308
It is not of this earth.

433
00:36:20,392 --> 00:36:22,060
Do we need the monkey, huh?

434
00:36:22,185 --> 00:36:23,436
I'm surprised at you, Jones...

435
00:36:23,561 --> 00:36:26,147
...talking that way about our baby.

436
00:36:26,272 --> 00:36:27,815
He's got your looks, too.

437
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:28,941
And your brains.

438
00:36:29,024 --> 00:36:30,817
Oops.

439
00:36:30,942 --> 00:36:31,943
I noticed that.

440
00:36:32,068 --> 00:36:35,071
She's a smart little thing...
smart.

441
00:36:37,323 --> 00:36:38,574
Hey.

442
00:36:38,657 --> 00:36:39,825
Hey, where you going?

443
00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:42,702
She'll be all right.
Have a date.

444
00:36:45,663 --> 00:36:46,789
Come on. Come on.

445
00:36:46,831 --> 00:36:47,790
Okay...

446
00:36:47,831 --> 00:36:48,790
Marion.

447
00:36:48,832 --> 00:36:49,833
What's this?

448
00:36:49,958 --> 00:36:51,293
It's a date.

449
00:36:51,334 --> 00:36:53,336
You eat 'em.

450
00:37:41,751 --> 00:37:44,087
How come you haven't found some
nice girl to settle down with,

451
00:37:44,212 --> 00:37:46,088
raise eight or nine kids,
like your friend Sallah?

452
00:37:46,213 --> 00:37:48,215
Who says I haven't?

453
00:37:49,258 --> 00:37:50,383
I do.

454
00:37:50,467 --> 00:37:53,511
Dad had you figured a long time ago.

455
00:38:01,726 --> 00:38:02,894
He said you were a bum.

456
00:38:03,019 --> 00:38:04,395
Oh, he's being generous.

457
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:06,522
The most gifted bum he ever trained.

458
00:38:06,605 --> 00:38:08,482
You know, he loved you like a son.

459
00:38:08,524 --> 00:38:10,525
Took a hell of a lot for you to alienate him.

460
00:38:10,609 --> 00:38:12,610
Not much, just you.

461
00:38:29,916 --> 00:38:31,042
Marion, get out of here.

462
00:38:31,167 --> 00:38:33,169
Duck.

463
00:39:13,828 --> 00:39:15,830
Right.

464
00:39:58,115 --> 00:40:00,117
Shh. Shh.

465
00:40:05,996 --> 00:40:07,998
Marion.

466
00:40:27,973 --> 00:40:29,975
Help. Over here, Indy.

467
00:40:30,017 --> 00:40:31,643
Get out of the way.

468
00:40:31,726 --> 00:40:33,728
Move. Move it.

469
00:40:34,645 --> 00:40:36,647
Help me.

470
00:40:40,859 --> 00:40:42,402
You can't do this to me.

471
00:40:42,527 --> 00:40:44,362
I'm an American.

472
00:40:44,404 --> 00:40:46,405
Indy.

473
00:40:50,033 --> 00:40:51,409
Indiana Jones.

474
00:40:51,534 --> 00:40:53,536
Help me, Jones.

475
00:41:13,678 --> 00:41:14,637
Jones.

476
00:41:14,679 --> 00:41:16,680
Marion.

477
00:41:19,808 --> 00:41:21,810
Indy.

478
00:42:03,344 --> 00:42:05,346
Marion...

479
00:42:42,752 --> 00:42:44,754
Dr. Jones.

480
00:43:11,276 --> 00:43:13,278
You looking for me?

481
00:43:21,409 --> 00:43:23,161
Belloq.

482
00:43:23,244 --> 00:43:24,662
Good afternoon, Dr. Jones.

483
00:43:24,787 --> 00:43:26,664
I ought to kill you right now.

484
00:43:26,789 --> 00:43:30,000
Not a very private place for a murder.

485
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:33,169
Well, these Arabs don't care
if we kill each other.

486
00:43:33,294 --> 00:43:36,422
They're not going
to interfere in our business.

487
00:43:36,505 --> 00:43:39,299
It was not I who brought
the girl into this business.

488
00:43:39,424 --> 00:43:41,509
Please, sit down before you fall down.

489
00:43:41,635 --> 00:43:45,429
We can at least behave like civilized people.

490
00:43:55,062 --> 00:43:57,189
I see your taste in friends
remains consistent.

491
00:43:57,314 --> 00:44:00,317
How odd that it should end this way for us,

492
00:44:00,442 --> 00:44:03,319
after so many stimulating encounters.

493
00:44:03,444 --> 00:44:05,196
I almost regret it.

494
00:44:05,321 --> 00:44:06,822
Where shall I find a new adversary...

495
00:44:06,906 --> 00:44:08,824
...so close to my own level?

496
00:44:08,949 --> 00:44:10,951
Try the local sewer.

497
00:44:13,411 --> 00:44:16,414
You and I are very much alike.

498
00:44:16,455 --> 00:44:18,832
Archaeology is our religion,

499
00:44:18,916 --> 00:44:23,461
yet we have both fallen from the purer faith.

500
00:44:23,544 --> 00:44:26,839
Our methods have not differed
as much as you pretend.

501
00:44:26,964 --> 00:44:30,342
I am a shadowy reflection of you.

502
00:44:30,467 --> 00:44:33,219
It would take only a nudge
to make you like me,

503
00:44:33,344 --> 00:44:35,429
to push you out of the light.

504
00:44:35,554 --> 00:44:39,099
Now you're getting nasty.

505
00:44:39,224 --> 00:44:41,351
You know it's true.

506
00:44:41,351 --> 00:44:43,228
How nice.

507
00:44:43,311 --> 00:44:45,313
Look at this.

508
00:44:45,354 --> 00:44:47,106
It's worthless.

509
00:44:47,231 --> 00:44:49,566
Ten dollars from a vendor in the street.

510
00:44:49,608 --> 00:44:50,734
But I take it,

511
00:44:50,859 --> 00:44:52,485
I bury it in the sand for a thousand years,

512
00:44:52,569 --> 00:44:56,363
it becomes priceless...
like the Ark.

513
00:44:56,447 --> 00:44:58,240
Men will kill for it.

514
00:44:58,323 --> 00:45:00,992
Men like you and me.

515
00:45:01,076 --> 00:45:04,120
What about your boss,
der Fuehrer?

516
00:45:04,245 --> 00:45:07,706
I thought he was waiting
to take possession.

517
00:45:07,748 --> 00:45:10,459
All in good time.

518
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:12,961
When I am finished with it.

519
00:45:13,002 --> 00:45:16,589
Jones, do you realize what the Ark is?

520
00:45:16,630 --> 00:45:18,632
It's a transmitter.

521
00:45:18,715 --> 00:45:21,509
It's a radio for speaking to God.

522
00:45:21,593 --> 00:45:23,720
And it's within my reach.

523
00:45:24,846 --> 00:45:28,724
You want to talk to God?

524
00:45:28,765 --> 00:45:30,517
Let's go see Him together.

525
00:45:30,642 --> 00:45:33,144
I've got nothing better to do.

526
00:45:33,603 --> 00:45:36,230
Uncle Indy, come back home now.

527
00:45:38,273 --> 00:45:40,275
Uncle Indy.

528
00:45:40,525 --> 00:45:42,027
Next time, Indiana Jones,

529
00:45:42,110 --> 00:45:45,655
it'll take more than children to save you.

530
00:45:46,113 --> 00:45:48,115
Uncle Indy.

531
00:46:01,543 --> 00:46:03,127
I thought I would find you there.

532
00:46:03,253 --> 00:46:06,797
Better than the United States Marines, eh?

533
00:46:14,762 --> 00:46:16,138
Marion's dead.

534
00:46:16,263 --> 00:46:17,431
Yes, I know.

535
00:46:17,556 --> 00:46:19,683
And me. And me.

536
00:46:19,808 --> 00:46:21,309
I'm sorry.

537
00:46:21,434 --> 00:46:23,144
Life goes on, Indy.

538
00:46:23,269 --> 00:46:25,271
There is the proof.

539
00:46:27,064 --> 00:46:29,066
Uh-oh.

540
00:46:29,066 --> 00:46:30,400
I have much to tell you.

541
00:46:30,442 --> 00:46:33,152
First we will take them home,

542
00:46:33,194 --> 00:46:36,655
and then I will take you to the old man.

543
00:47:25,821 --> 00:47:27,948
I can't figure out how Belloq did it.

544
00:47:27,990 --> 00:47:30,450
Where'd he get a copy of the headpiece?

545
00:47:30,492 --> 00:47:33,745
There are no pictures,
no duplicates of it anywhere.

546
00:47:33,870 --> 00:47:36,831
I tell you only what I saw with my own eyes:

547
00:47:36,872 --> 00:47:38,207
A headpiece like that one,

548
00:47:38,332 --> 00:47:40,500
except round the edges,
which were rougher.

549
00:47:40,625 --> 00:47:42,627
In the center, the Frenchman
had embedded a crystal,

550
00:47:42,752 --> 00:47:47,631
and... and surrounding
the crystal, on one side,

551
00:47:47,715 --> 00:47:51,218
there were raised markings,
just like that one.

552
00:47:51,343 --> 00:47:54,095
They made their calculations
in the map room?

553
00:47:54,220 --> 00:47:55,513
This morning.

554
00:47:55,638 --> 00:47:57,890
Belloq and the boss German,
Dietrich.

555
00:47:58,015 --> 00:48:00,600
When they came out of the map room,

556
00:48:00,725 --> 00:48:02,894
they gave us a new spot in which to dig,

557
00:48:03,019 --> 00:48:05,771
out away from the camp.

558
00:48:05,855 --> 00:48:07,773
The Well of the Souls, huh?

559
00:48:07,898 --> 00:48:11,776
Come, come, look.
Look here... look.

560
00:48:11,860 --> 00:48:13,361
Sit down.

561
00:48:13,403 --> 00:48:14,904
Come, sit down.

562
00:48:15,029 --> 00:48:17,031
What is it?

563
00:48:17,031 --> 00:48:19,241
This is a warning...

564
00:48:19,283 --> 00:48:21,743
...not to disturb the Ark of the Covenant.

565
00:48:21,785 --> 00:48:23,411
What about the height of the staff, though?

566
00:48:23,494 --> 00:48:24,537
Did Belloq get it off of here?

567
00:48:24,662 --> 00:48:25,538
Yes.

568
00:48:25,663 --> 00:48:27,039
It is here.

569
00:48:27,122 --> 00:48:28,916
This were the old way,

570
00:48:29,041 --> 00:48:31,501
this mean six kadam high.

571
00:48:31,543 --> 00:48:33,544
About 72 inches.
- Wait.

572
00:48:36,297 --> 00:48:39,174
'And take back one kadam...

573
00:48:39,258 --> 00:48:43,052
...to honor the Hebrew God
whose Ark this is.'

574
00:48:55,313 --> 00:48:57,273
You said their headpiece
only had markings on one side.

575
00:48:57,314 --> 00:48:59,399
Are you absolutely sure?

576
00:49:01,151 --> 00:49:02,819
Belloq's staff is too long.

577
00:49:02,944 --> 00:49:05,905
They're digging in the wrong place.

578
00:49:08,407 --> 00:49:10,450
I am the monarch of the sea

579
00:49:10,575 --> 00:49:12,660
I am the ruler of the...

580
00:49:23,336 --> 00:49:25,338
Bad dates.

581
00:49:40,100 --> 00:49:42,310
I told you not to be premature...

582
00:49:42,435 --> 00:49:44,729
...in your communiqué to Berlin.

583
00:49:44,812 --> 00:49:48,107
Archaeology is not an exact science.

584
00:49:48,190 --> 00:49:50,317
It does not deal in time schedules.

585
00:49:50,358 --> 00:49:52,360
The fuehrer is not a patient man.

586
00:49:52,485 --> 00:49:55,863
He demands constant reports,
and he expects progress.

587
00:49:55,988 --> 00:49:57,448
You led me to believe...

588
00:49:57,489 --> 00:49:58,949
Nothing.
I made no promises.

589
00:49:58,991 --> 00:50:00,992
I only said it looked very favorable.

590
00:50:01,076 --> 00:50:04,328
Besides, with the information
in our possession,

591
00:50:04,370 --> 00:50:06,330
my calculations were correct.

592
00:50:06,372 --> 00:50:09,249
Boy, they're not kidding,
are they?

593
00:50:10,125 --> 00:50:12,002
What time does the sun hit the map room?

594
00:50:12,127 --> 00:50:14,128
At about 9:00 in the morning.

595
00:50:14,212 --> 00:50:15,338
Not much time, then.

596
00:50:15,379 --> 00:50:18,215
Where are they digging
for the Well of the Souls?

597
00:50:18,340 --> 00:50:21,509
On that ridge...
but the map room's over there.

598
00:50:21,635 --> 00:50:23,636
Let's go, come on.

599
00:54:29,466 --> 00:54:31,468
Sallah.

600
00:54:32,052 --> 00:54:34,053
Sallah.

601
00:54:41,726 --> 00:54:43,728
They're here.

602
00:54:53,736 --> 00:54:55,196
Please, my friend,
what is the matter?

603
00:54:55,238 --> 00:54:58,740
I fetch the water.
I shall get it for you.

604
00:54:59,741 --> 00:55:01,743
If you want water,
I will get you water.

605
00:55:01,868 --> 00:55:03,870
No problem, no problem.

606
00:55:17,131 --> 00:55:18,465
I thought you were dead.

607
00:55:18,590 --> 00:55:21,218
You must have switched baskets.

608
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:25,888
Are you hurt?

609
00:55:26,013 --> 00:55:28,640
No. You have to get me out of here, quick.

610
00:55:28,765 --> 00:55:31,017
They're gonna be back at any minute.

611
00:55:31,142 --> 00:55:32,018
Cut me loose.

612
00:55:32,143 --> 00:55:33,102
Quick.

613
00:55:33,228 --> 00:55:36,647
They keep asking about you.
What you know.

614
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:41,776
What's wrong?

615
00:55:41,901 --> 00:55:42,777
Cut me loose.

616
00:55:42,902 --> 00:55:44,278
I know where the Ark is, Marion.

617
00:55:44,404 --> 00:55:46,614
The Ark's here?

618
00:55:46,655 --> 00:55:48,282
I'm coming with you, Jones.
Get me out of here.

619
00:55:48,407 --> 00:55:49,658
Cut me loose.
You can't leave me here.

620
00:55:49,783 --> 00:55:50,784
If I take you out of here now,

621
00:55:50,909 --> 00:55:52,368
they'll start combing the place for us.

622
00:55:52,410 --> 00:55:53,870
Jones, you've got to get me out of here.

623
00:55:53,911 --> 00:55:56,664
Come on, Jones, are you crazy?.

624
00:55:56,747 --> 00:55:58,123
Marion, I hate to do this,

625
00:55:58,248 --> 00:56:00,792
but if you don't sit still and keep quiet,

626
00:56:00,876 --> 00:56:04,003
this whole thing is going to be shot.

627
00:56:04,670 --> 00:56:06,255
I'll be back to get you.

628
00:56:06,297 --> 00:56:08,424
Jones, what's the matter?

629
00:56:53,711 --> 00:56:55,296
That's it.

630
00:56:55,338 --> 00:56:56,464
Who knows?

631
00:56:56,547 --> 00:56:58,465
Perhaps the Ark is still waiting...

632
00:56:58,590 --> 00:57:01,051
...in some antechamber for us to discover.

633
00:57:01,176 --> 00:57:04,971
Perhaps there's some vital
bit of evidence which eludes us.

634
00:57:05,096 --> 00:57:05,971
Perhaps...

635
00:57:06,097 --> 00:57:07,723
Perhaps the girl can help us.

636
00:57:07,848 --> 00:57:09,182
My feeling exactly.

637
00:57:09,224 --> 00:57:12,352
She was in possession
of the original piece for years.

638
00:57:12,477 --> 00:57:14,812
She may know much,
if properly motivated.

639
00:57:14,854 --> 00:57:17,731
I tell you,
the girl knows nothing.

640
00:57:18,482 --> 00:57:20,358
I'm surprised to find you squeamish.

641
00:57:20,484 --> 00:57:21,985
That is not your reputation.

642
00:57:22,068 --> 00:57:23,444
But it needn't concern you.

643
00:57:23,486 --> 00:57:27,364
I have the perfect man for this kind of work.

644
00:57:30,575 --> 00:57:32,994
Heil Hitler.

645
00:58:56,188 --> 00:58:57,398
Indy. Here.

646
00:58:57,523 --> 00:58:59,524
We've hit stone.

647
00:59:02,569 --> 00:59:04,070
Clear it off.

648
00:59:04,195 --> 00:59:06,197
Come on, find the edges.

649
00:59:22,419 --> 00:59:24,087
Good, good, good.

650
00:59:24,170 --> 00:59:25,713
You see, Indy? You see?

651
00:59:25,796 --> 00:59:27,673
Okay, bring the pry bars in.

652
00:59:27,715 --> 00:59:30,050
As a team, boys. As a team.

653
00:59:31,593 --> 00:59:33,594
Push.

654
00:59:37,806 --> 00:59:38,932
Get 'em in there.

655
00:59:39,057 --> 00:59:39,933
Get 'em under.

656
00:59:40,058 --> 00:59:40,934
Good, good, that's it.

657
00:59:41,059 --> 00:59:43,061
Watch your toes.

658
00:59:49,608 --> 00:59:51,610
Carefully, carefully.

659
01:00:02,452 --> 01:00:04,996
Sorry, Indy.

660
01:00:06,122 --> 01:00:08,373
Indy...

661
01:00:08,457 --> 01:00:11,126
...why does the floor move?

662
01:00:12,460 --> 01:00:14,587
Give me your torch.

663
01:00:44,904 --> 01:00:46,906
Snakes.

664
01:00:46,906 --> 01:00:49,366
Why did it have to be snakes?

665
01:00:51,993 --> 01:00:54,912
Asps.

666
01:00:54,996 --> 01:00:57,539
Very dangerous.

667
01:00:57,665 --> 01:00:59,666
You go first.

668
01:01:18,182 --> 01:01:20,267
If you're trying to escape on foot,

669
01:01:20,308 --> 01:01:23,561
the desert is three weeks in every direction,

670
01:01:23,686 --> 01:01:25,813
so please, eat something.

671
01:01:32,569 --> 01:01:34,695
I must apologize for their treatment of you.

672
01:01:34,821 --> 01:01:35,905
Yeah. Whose idea was it?

673
01:01:36,030 --> 01:01:37,072
No food, no water.

674
01:01:37,197 --> 01:01:39,324
What kind of people
are these friends of yours?

675
01:01:39,449 --> 01:01:42,327
At this particular time
and place, to do my work,

676
01:01:42,452 --> 01:01:44,328
they are necessary evils.

677
01:01:44,412 --> 01:01:45,830
They're not my friends.

678
01:01:45,955 --> 01:01:48,165
However, with the right connections,

679
01:01:48,207 --> 01:01:50,167
even in this part of the world,

680
01:01:50,208 --> 01:01:53,294
we are not entirely uncivilized.

681
01:01:54,921 --> 01:01:56,922
It's beautiful.

682
01:01:56,922 --> 01:02:00,342
I would very much like to see you in it.

683
01:02:01,468 --> 01:02:03,594
I'll bet you would.

684
01:02:07,556 --> 01:02:09,558
All right.

685
01:02:17,439 --> 01:02:20,609
What do you got to drink around here?

686
01:02:22,235 --> 01:02:24,362
We don't have much time.

687
01:02:24,487 --> 01:02:25,363
Soon they will come to harm you,

688
01:02:25,488 --> 01:02:26,363
Soon they will come to harm you,

689
01:02:26,489 --> 01:02:28,490
and I will not be able to stop them,

690
01:02:28,574 --> 01:02:31,076
unless you are able to give me something...

691
01:02:31,117 --> 01:02:33,119
...to placate them.

692
01:02:33,119 --> 01:02:36,080
Some, uh, piece of information...

693
01:02:36,122 --> 01:02:38,874
...which I can use to protect you from them.

694
01:02:38,999 --> 01:02:41,209
I've already told you everything I know.

695
01:02:41,251 --> 01:02:44,003
I have no loyalty to Jones.

696
01:02:44,087 --> 01:02:47,131
He's brought me nothing but trouble.

697
01:02:53,011 --> 01:02:55,263
Marion, you are beautiful.

698
01:03:00,017 --> 01:03:03,228
I don't think we need a chaperone.

699
01:03:06,272 --> 01:03:07,773
Steadily.

700
01:03:07,856 --> 01:03:09,858
Steadily. Whoa.

701
01:03:12,110 --> 01:03:13,152
Down...

702
01:03:13,278 --> 01:03:14,278
Down... Whoa.

703
01:03:14,404 --> 01:03:15,488
Carefully, carefully.

704
01:03:15,613 --> 01:03:17,781
You all right, Indy?

705
01:03:20,492 --> 01:03:25,413
Now gently, boys.
Gently, gently.

706
01:03:33,628 --> 01:03:35,630
Whoa...

707
01:03:44,429 --> 01:03:47,139
I told you it will be all right.

708
01:04:02,318 --> 01:04:04,320
Huh...

709
01:04:11,951 --> 01:04:13,953
Sallah, get down here.

710
01:04:33,177 --> 01:04:35,179
You pour.

711
01:06:28,440 --> 01:06:30,442
Oh, that's good.

712
01:06:33,695 --> 01:06:35,696
Whoops.

713
01:06:41,326 --> 01:06:43,453
What is this stuff, Rene?

714
01:06:44,787 --> 01:06:46,789
I grew up with this.

715
01:06:47,790 --> 01:06:49,791
It's my family label.

716
01:07:18,690 --> 01:07:22,193
Well... I have to be going now, Rene.

717
01:07:23,986 --> 01:07:27,114
I like you, Rene, very much.

718
01:07:27,197 --> 01:07:31,701
Perhaps we'll meet someday
under better circumstances.

719
01:07:34,203 --> 01:07:36,372
We meet again, Fraulein.

720
01:07:37,998 --> 01:07:40,876
You Americans,
you're all the same.

721
01:07:42,377 --> 01:07:46,005
Always overdressing
for the wrong occasions.

722
01:08:16,030 --> 01:08:18,282
Now...

723
01:08:20,784 --> 01:08:23,536
...what shall we talk about?

724
01:09:41,226 --> 01:09:44,103
All right... take it up.

725
01:09:44,228 --> 01:09:46,230
Easy.

726
01:09:47,856 --> 01:09:49,566
You're as stubborn as that girl.

727
01:09:49,608 --> 01:09:52,235
You like her too much, I think.

728
01:09:52,360 --> 01:09:56,989
Your methods of archaeology
are too primitive for me.

729
01:09:57,114 --> 01:10:01,117
You would use a bulldozer
to find a... China cup.

730
01:10:05,621 --> 01:10:07,373
Shliemann. Wake your men.

731
01:10:07,456 --> 01:10:09,625
Indy, the torches are burning out.

732
01:10:09,708 --> 01:10:11,710
Go on, get out of here.

733
01:10:11,710 --> 01:10:13,711
Hyah.

734
01:10:31,393 --> 01:10:32,519
Sallah.

735
01:10:32,644 --> 01:10:34,645
Hello.

736
01:10:34,645 --> 01:10:35,521
Hello.

737
01:10:35,646 --> 01:10:38,232
Why, Dr. Jones,
whatever are you doing...

738
01:10:38,273 --> 01:10:40,775
...in such a nasty place?

739
01:10:40,901 --> 01:10:42,861
Why don't you come on down here.
I'll show you.

740
01:10:42,986 --> 01:10:43,986
Thank you, my friend,

741
01:10:44,028 --> 01:10:46,489
but I think we are all
very comfortable up here.

742
01:10:46,614 --> 01:10:48,615
That's right, isn't it?

743
01:10:48,907 --> 01:10:52,035
Yes, we are very comfortable up here.

744
01:10:52,619 --> 01:10:54,620
So, once again, Jones,

745
01:10:54,662 --> 01:10:57,790
what was briefly yours is now mine.

746
01:10:57,790 --> 01:11:00,292
What a fitting end to your life's pursuits.

747
01:11:00,417 --> 01:11:02,877
You're about to become
a permanent addition...

748
01:11:03,002 --> 01:11:04,545
...to this archaeological find.

749
01:11:04,670 --> 01:11:05,880
Who knows?

750
01:11:06,005 --> 01:11:10,425
In a thousand years,
even you may be worth something.

751
01:11:10,550 --> 01:11:12,260
Son of a bitch.

752
01:11:12,302 --> 01:11:14,178
I'm afraid we must be
going now, Dr. Jones.

753
01:11:14,303 --> 01:11:16,555
Our prize is awaited in Berlin.

754
01:11:16,680 --> 01:11:18,557
But I do not wish to leave you...

755
01:11:18,682 --> 01:11:21,017
...down in that awful place all alone.

756
01:11:21,059 --> 01:11:22,894
Slimy pig, you let me go.

757
01:11:23,019 --> 01:11:25,021
Stop it.

758
01:11:26,814 --> 01:11:28,315
Marion.

759
01:11:28,440 --> 01:11:30,442
Hang on.

760
01:11:30,692 --> 01:11:31,693
Don't...

761
01:11:31,818 --> 01:11:33,444
Indy.
- Don't fall.

762
01:11:33,528 --> 01:11:36,822
Marion, I got you.
I got you. I got you.

763
01:11:39,574 --> 01:11:43,077
You traitor.
You get your hands off of me.

764
01:11:49,791 --> 01:11:51,793
Snakes.

765
01:11:52,335 --> 01:11:54,670
Oh, sh... oh, at your feet.

766
01:11:55,463 --> 01:11:56,589
The girl was mine.

767
01:11:56,714 --> 01:11:57,589
She's of no use to us.

768
01:11:57,715 --> 01:12:01,218
Only our mission for the fuehrer matters.

769
01:12:02,177 --> 01:12:04,220
I wonder sometimes, Monsieur,

770
01:12:04,345 --> 01:12:06,680
if you have that clearly in mind.

771
01:12:06,722 --> 01:12:08,682
It was not to be, chérie.

772
01:12:08,724 --> 01:12:11,476
You bastards.
I'll get you for this.

773
01:12:11,559 --> 01:12:14,353
Indiana Jones...

774
01:12:14,562 --> 01:12:16,480
...adieu.

775
01:12:28,073 --> 01:12:30,075
No.

776
01:12:39,249 --> 01:12:40,500
Take this.

777
01:12:40,584 --> 01:12:42,335
Wave it at anything that slithers.

778
01:12:42,377 --> 01:12:43,586
Thank you.

779
01:12:43,628 --> 01:12:47,339
Oh, my God, this whole place is slithering.

780
01:12:49,383 --> 01:12:50,467
Indy.

781
01:12:50,592 --> 01:12:53,136
Ow. Jesus.

782
01:12:54,846 --> 01:12:57,389
Where did you get this?
From him?

783
01:12:57,473 --> 01:12:58,765
I was trying to escape.

784
01:12:58,891 --> 01:12:59,766
No thanks to you.

785
01:12:59,891 --> 01:13:01,351
How hard were you trying?

786
01:13:01,393 --> 01:13:02,602
Well, where the hell were you?

787
01:13:02,644 --> 01:13:03,895
Watch it, watch it.

788
01:13:04,020 --> 01:13:05,271
What are you doing?.

789
01:13:05,396 --> 01:13:07,398
For the fire.

790
01:13:09,024 --> 01:13:10,734
How the hell are we going
to get out of here?

791
01:13:10,775 --> 01:13:12,277
I'm working on it.
I'm working on it.

792
01:13:12,360 --> 01:13:15,905
Well, whatever you're doing, do it faster.

793
01:13:18,282 --> 01:13:19,616
Ah...

794
01:13:19,741 --> 01:13:21,534
Where are you going?

795
01:13:21,618 --> 01:13:23,036
Through that wall.

796
01:13:23,119 --> 01:13:25,496
Just get ready to run,
whatever happens to me.

797
01:13:25,621 --> 01:13:27,665
What do you mean by that?

798
01:13:38,632 --> 01:13:41,134
Indy.

799
01:13:41,176 --> 01:13:45,179
Damn it. Don't you leave me
down here by myself.

800
01:14:08,824 --> 01:14:10,575
Indy.

801
01:14:10,659 --> 01:14:11,826
Here we go.

802
01:14:11,910 --> 01:14:12,827
Get ready.

803
01:14:12,911 --> 01:14:16,789
Indy, the torch is going out.

804
01:14:57,740 --> 01:14:59,741
Indy?

805
01:15:19,508 --> 01:15:21,218
Marion.

806
01:15:21,343 --> 01:15:23,761
Look. Look.

807
01:16:01,918 --> 01:16:03,628
They're going to fly it out of here.

808
01:16:03,753 --> 01:16:05,046
When that Ark gets loaded,

809
01:16:05,171 --> 01:16:08,507
we're already going to be on the plane.

810
01:16:12,052 --> 01:16:15,930
Ah, monsieur, let us toast
our success in the desert.

811
01:16:16,055 --> 01:16:17,264
To the Ark.

812
01:16:17,306 --> 01:16:19,266
When we are very far from here.

813
01:16:19,391 --> 01:16:21,393
That will do.

814
01:17:13,228 --> 01:17:17,606
Hey, you now... come here.

815
01:17:17,731 --> 01:17:19,733
Come here.

816
01:18:24,370 --> 01:18:26,372
Indy.

817
01:19:16,664 --> 01:19:19,708
Stay with the Ark.
Stay with the Ark.

818
01:19:24,420 --> 01:19:26,422
Look out.

819
01:19:36,097 --> 01:19:37,431
Oh, my God.

820
01:19:37,473 --> 01:19:38,223
Marion.

821
01:19:38,348 --> 01:19:41,184
In here. Up here.

822
01:19:43,853 --> 01:19:44,854
Indy, come on.

823
01:19:44,979 --> 01:19:46,063
Hold on.

824
01:19:46,105 --> 01:19:48,440
Move up.
It's gonna blow up.

825
01:19:49,941 --> 01:19:53,236
It's stuck. Indy.

826
01:19:54,487 --> 01:19:56,489
I can't push it off.

827
01:20:25,888 --> 01:20:26,764
It's stuck.

828
01:20:26,889 --> 01:20:28,265
Turn it. Turn it.
- It's stuck.

829
01:20:28,390 --> 01:20:29,474
Turn it there.

830
01:20:29,599 --> 01:20:32,143
Never mind.
Get back. Get back.

831
01:20:52,785 --> 01:20:55,121
Get the Ark away from
this place immediately.

832
01:20:55,162 --> 01:20:57,039
Have it put on the truck.

833
01:20:57,164 --> 01:20:58,540
We'll fly it out of Cairo.

834
01:20:58,665 --> 01:21:02,043
And Gobler, I want plenty of protection.

835
01:21:07,923 --> 01:21:09,925
Jones.

836
01:21:15,388 --> 01:21:16,680
Holy smoke, my friends,

837
01:21:16,806 --> 01:21:19,808
I... I'm so pleased you're not dead.

838
01:21:20,434 --> 01:21:21,893
Indy, Indy, we have no time.

839
01:21:22,018 --> 01:21:23,311
If you still want the Ark,

840
01:21:23,436 --> 01:21:25,813
it is being loaded onto a truck for Cairo.

841
01:21:25,896 --> 01:21:27,690
Truck?

842
01:21:27,815 --> 01:21:29,816
What truck?

843
01:21:56,297 --> 01:21:58,298
Let's go.

844
01:22:05,971 --> 01:22:08,182
Get back to Cairo.

845
01:22:08,223 --> 01:22:10,308
Get us some transport to England...

846
01:22:10,350 --> 01:22:13,311
...boat, plane, anything.

847
01:22:13,436 --> 01:22:14,353
Meet me at Omar's.

848
01:22:14,479 --> 01:22:15,354
Be ready for me.

849
01:22:15,479 --> 01:22:16,564
I'm going after that truck.

850
01:22:16,605 --> 01:22:17,564
How?

851
01:22:17,606 --> 01:22:18,565
I don't know.

852
01:22:18,607 --> 01:22:20,942
I'm making this up as I go.

853
01:25:57,539 --> 01:25:59,541
Ew.

854
01:28:20,909 --> 01:28:22,911
He's there.

855
01:29:14,537 --> 01:29:16,539
Idiot. Idiot.

856
01:30:01,076 --> 01:30:03,203
Everything at last has been arranged.

857
01:30:03,244 --> 01:30:04,495
The Ark?

858
01:30:04,620 --> 01:30:05,621
Is on board.

859
01:30:05,705 --> 01:30:07,623
Nothing is lacking,
now that you're here.

860
01:30:07,706 --> 01:30:08,957
Or what is left of you.

861
01:30:08,999 --> 01:30:09,958
You trust these guys?

862
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:11,376
Yes.

863
01:30:11,459 --> 01:30:13,628
Mr. Katanga.

864
01:30:17,881 --> 01:30:20,383
Mr. Katanga,
these are my friends.

865
01:30:20,467 --> 01:30:22,218
They are my family.

866
01:30:22,260 --> 01:30:25,137
I will hear of it if they are not treated well.

867
01:30:25,263 --> 01:30:28,223
My cabin is theirs.

868
01:30:28,390 --> 01:30:29,975
Mr. Jones...

869
01:30:30,017 --> 01:30:32,519
I've heard a lot about you, sir.

870
01:30:32,644 --> 01:30:36,480
Your appearance is exactly
the way I imagined.

871
01:30:40,609 --> 01:30:42,902
Good-bye.

872
01:30:44,278 --> 01:30:46,363
Look out for each other.

873
01:30:46,405 --> 01:30:48,532
I am already missing you.

874
01:30:50,784 --> 01:30:53,036
You're my good friend.

875
01:30:54,787 --> 01:30:56,789
Sallah.

876
01:31:00,167 --> 01:31:02,919
That is for Fayah...

877
01:31:03,002 --> 01:31:05,421
...that is for your children...

878
01:31:05,546 --> 01:31:07,923
...and this is for you.

879
01:31:12,677 --> 01:31:14,679
Thank you.

880
01:31:22,894 --> 01:31:27,815
A British tar is a soaring soul

881
01:31:27,940 --> 01:31:32,444
As free as a mountain bird

882
01:31:32,569 --> 01:31:36,197
His energetic fist should be ready to...

883
01:31:38,699 --> 01:31:40,659
...a dictator...

884
01:31:47,081 --> 01:31:49,082
Where did you go?

885
01:31:49,082 --> 01:31:51,084
I'm cleaning up.

886
01:31:51,710 --> 01:31:53,711
Where'd you get that?

887
01:31:53,711 --> 01:31:55,087
From him.

888
01:31:55,213 --> 01:31:56,547
Who him?

889
01:31:56,589 --> 01:31:57,548
Katanga.

890
01:31:57,589 --> 01:31:59,466
I got a feeling I'm not the first woman...

891
01:31:59,591 --> 01:32:01,218
...ever to travel with these pirates.

892
01:32:01,343 --> 01:32:03,469
It's lovely.

893
01:32:03,553 --> 01:32:04,470
Yeah?

894
01:32:04,554 --> 01:32:05,471
Yeah.

895
01:32:05,554 --> 01:32:06,472
Really?

896
01:32:06,555 --> 01:32:08,557
Yeah.

897
01:32:19,608 --> 01:32:21,610
What'd you say?

898
01:32:28,365 --> 01:32:30,575
Wait... I don't need any help.

899
01:32:30,617 --> 01:32:32,619
You know you do.

900
01:32:33,995 --> 01:32:37,498
You're not the man I knew ten years ago.

901
01:32:37,581 --> 01:32:42,127
It's not the years, honey,
it's the mileage.

902
01:32:45,504 --> 01:32:47,506
You are...

903
01:32:48,715 --> 01:32:50,258
Please, I don't need a nurse.

904
01:32:50,383 --> 01:32:51,843
I just want to sleep.
- Don't be such a baby.

905
01:32:51,885 --> 01:32:52,886
Marion, leave me alone.

906
01:32:53,011 --> 01:32:54,387
What is this here?
- Go away.

907
01:32:54,470 --> 01:32:56,847
Yes, it hurts.

908
01:32:56,889 --> 01:32:58,140
Ow.

909
01:32:58,265 --> 01:33:01,893
Well, goddamn it, Indy,
where doesn't it hurt?

910
01:33:02,018 --> 01:33:04,020
Here.

911
01:33:09,274 --> 01:33:11,276
Here.

912
01:33:19,283 --> 01:33:21,284
This isn't too bad.

913
01:33:30,792 --> 01:33:32,794
Here.

914
01:33:52,644 --> 01:33:54,562
Jones...

915
01:33:56,397 --> 01:33:58,440
Jones?.

916
01:34:00,942 --> 01:34:04,695
We never seem to get a break, do we?

917
01:34:30,967 --> 01:34:32,343
What is it?

918
01:34:32,469 --> 01:34:33,845
Engines have stopped.

919
01:34:33,928 --> 01:34:35,930
I'm going to go check.

920
01:34:46,188 --> 01:34:47,106
What's happening?

921
01:34:47,189 --> 01:34:48,440
We have most important friends.

922
01:34:48,482 --> 01:34:50,484
Holy shit.

923
01:34:51,860 --> 01:34:52,610
I sent my man for you.

924
01:34:52,735 --> 01:34:53,820
You and the girl must disappear.

925
01:34:53,861 --> 01:34:54,862
We have a place in the hold.

926
01:34:54,987 --> 01:34:55,571
Come on, go, go, go.

927
01:34:55,696 --> 01:34:57,990
Come on, go, my friend, go.

928
01:35:09,374 --> 01:35:11,751
Where is Dr. Jones?

929
01:35:11,835 --> 01:35:12,710
What's the big idea?

930
01:35:12,836 --> 01:35:14,837
Let go.

931
01:35:18,257 --> 01:35:21,009
Don't you touch me.

932
01:36:05,046 --> 01:36:06,922
What about Jones?

933
01:36:07,006 --> 01:36:09,299
There's no trace yet, sir.

934
01:36:09,383 --> 01:36:11,426
Jones is dead.

935
01:36:12,802 --> 01:36:15,012
I killed him.

936
01:36:15,054 --> 01:36:17,056
He was of no use to us.

937
01:36:17,056 --> 01:36:22,143
This girl, however, has certain
value where we're headed.

938
01:36:22,268 --> 01:36:24,770
She'll bring a very good price.

939
01:36:24,812 --> 01:36:25,771
Mmm?

940
01:36:25,813 --> 01:36:29,441
Herr Colonel,
that cargo you've taken...

941
01:36:29,524 --> 01:36:31,401
...if it's your goal,
go in peace with it,

942
01:36:31,443 --> 01:36:32,569
but leave us the girl.

943
01:36:32,652 --> 01:36:34,529
It would reduce our loss on this trip.

944
01:36:34,570 --> 01:36:36,280
Savage.

945
01:36:36,405 --> 01:36:39,950
You are not in the position
to ask for anything.

946
01:36:40,033 --> 01:36:41,910
We will take what we wish.

947
01:36:41,951 --> 01:36:43,661
And then decide whether or not...

948
01:36:43,786 --> 01:36:46,831
...to blow your ship from the water.

949
01:36:48,957 --> 01:36:50,333
The girl goes with me.

950
01:36:50,459 --> 01:36:52,710
She'll be part of my compensation.

951
01:36:52,794 --> 01:36:55,087
I'm sure your fuehrer would approve.

952
01:36:55,213 --> 01:36:56,922
If she fails to please me,

953
01:36:56,964 --> 01:36:59,049
you may do with her as you wish.

954
01:36:59,091 --> 01:37:01,926
I will waste no more time with her now.

955
01:37:01,968 --> 01:37:03,970
Excuse me.

956
01:37:19,483 --> 01:37:21,234
I can't find Mr. Jones, Captain.

957
01:37:21,318 --> 01:37:22,569
I've looked everywhere.

958
01:37:22,610 --> 01:37:25,196
He's got to be here somewhere.

959
01:37:25,238 --> 01:37:27,239
Look again.

960
01:37:28,240 --> 01:37:29,991
I found him.
- Where?

961
01:37:30,117 --> 01:37:32,118
There.

962
01:39:57,239 --> 01:39:59,449
The altar has been
prepared in accordance...

963
01:39:59,491 --> 01:40:01,368
...with your radio instructions,
sir.

964
01:40:01,451 --> 01:40:02,452
Good.

965
01:40:02,577 --> 01:40:05,204
Take the Ark there immediately.

966
01:40:05,705 --> 01:40:07,706
Monsieur...

967
01:40:09,875 --> 01:40:12,002
I am uncomfortable with the thought...

968
01:40:12,127 --> 01:40:14,712
...of this... Jewish ritual.

969
01:40:16,255 --> 01:40:18,632
Are you sure it's necessary?

970
01:40:18,632 --> 01:40:20,509
Let me ask you this:

971
01:40:20,634 --> 01:40:24,762
Would you be more comfortable
opening the Ark in Berlin,

972
01:40:24,846 --> 01:40:26,639
for your fuehrer?

973
01:40:26,722 --> 01:40:27,973
Finding out, only then,

974
01:40:28,015 --> 01:40:31,017
if the sacred pieces
of the Covenant are inside?

975
01:40:31,142 --> 01:40:32,143
Knowing, only then,

976
01:40:32,268 --> 01:40:34,270
whether you have accomplished
your mission,

977
01:40:34,353 --> 01:40:37,398
and obtained the one true Ark?

978
01:42:05,805 --> 01:42:07,806
Hello.

979
01:42:09,725 --> 01:42:11,685
Jones.

980
01:42:12,185 --> 01:42:13,561
Jones.

981
01:42:13,603 --> 01:42:16,480
I'm going to blow up the Ark,
Rene.

982
01:42:21,610 --> 01:42:25,738
Your persistence surprises even me.

983
01:42:25,863 --> 01:42:28,240
You're going to give
mercenaries a bad name.

984
01:42:28,365 --> 01:42:30,992
Dr. Jones...

985
01:42:33,494 --> 01:42:35,996
...surely you don't think you can
escape from this island.

986
01:42:36,122 --> 01:42:39,082
That depends on how reasonable
we're all willing to be.

987
01:42:39,208 --> 01:42:41,376
All I want is the girl.

988
01:42:45,504 --> 01:42:47,256
If we refuse?

989
01:42:47,339 --> 01:42:51,134
Then your fuehrer has no prize.

990
01:42:51,218 --> 01:42:52,385
Okay, stand back.

991
01:42:52,510 --> 01:42:53,761
All of you, stand back.

992
01:42:53,886 --> 01:42:55,388
Stand back.

993
01:42:55,513 --> 01:42:56,639
Okay, Jones.

994
01:42:56,764 --> 01:42:59,891
You win.

995
01:42:59,975 --> 01:43:01,976
Blow it up.

996
01:43:07,147 --> 01:43:09,149
Yes, blow it up.

997
01:43:10,609 --> 01:43:12,610
Blow it back to God.

998
01:43:12,652 --> 01:43:14,654
All your life has been spent...

999
01:43:14,779 --> 01:43:17,281
...in pursuit of archaeological relics.

1000
01:43:17,406 --> 01:43:21,868
Inside the Ark are treasures
beyond your wildest aspirations.

1001
01:43:21,910 --> 01:43:26,288
You want to see it open as well as I.

1002
01:43:26,372 --> 01:43:28,624
Indiana...

1003
01:43:28,665 --> 01:43:32,919
...we are simply passing through history.

1004
01:43:33,002 --> 01:43:35,004
This...

1005
01:43:36,797 --> 01:43:38,799
This is history.

1006
01:43:47,640 --> 01:43:50,017
Do as you will.

1007
01:46:24,937 --> 01:46:27,314
Marion, don't look at it.

1008
01:46:27,439 --> 01:46:28,440
Shut your eyes, Marion.

1009
01:46:28,524 --> 01:46:31,901
Don't look at it,
no matter what happens.

1010
01:46:42,035 --> 01:46:44,537
Ah...

1011
01:46:58,590 --> 01:47:01,343
It's beautiful.

1012
01:47:11,434 --> 01:47:12,560
Indy?

1013
01:47:12,602 --> 01:47:13,853
Don't look, Marion.

1014
01:47:13,978 --> 01:47:15,980
Keep your eyes shut.

1015
01:48:33,419 --> 01:48:35,421
Marion.

1016
01:49:07,072 --> 01:49:10,158
You've done your country a
great service, and we thank you...

1017
01:49:10,200 --> 01:49:14,579
...and we trust you found
the settlement satisfactory.

1018
01:49:14,704 --> 01:49:15,788
Oh, the money's fine.

1019
01:49:15,913 --> 01:49:17,706
The situation's totally unacceptable.

1020
01:49:17,790 --> 01:49:18,707
Well, gentlemen,

1021
01:49:18,790 --> 01:49:20,459
I guess that just about wraps it up.

1022
01:49:20,584 --> 01:49:22,335
Where is the Ark?

1023
01:49:22,460 --> 01:49:25,671
I thought we'd settled that.

1024
01:49:25,713 --> 01:49:27,965
The Ark is somewhere very safe.

1025
01:49:28,090 --> 01:49:29,174
From whom?

1026
01:49:29,216 --> 01:49:32,302
The Ark is a source of unspeakable power...

1027
01:49:32,343 --> 01:49:34,470
...and it has to be researched.

1028
01:49:34,554 --> 01:49:37,598
And it will be,
I assure you, Dr. Brody,

1029
01:49:37,723 --> 01:49:38,849
Dr. Jones.

1030
01:49:38,932 --> 01:49:42,477
We have top men working on it right now.

1031
01:49:43,853 --> 01:49:45,855
Who?

1032
01:49:46,730 --> 01:49:48,982
Top men.

1033
01:49:52,235 --> 01:49:54,570
Hey, what happened?

1034
01:49:54,612 --> 01:49:55,613
You don't look very happy.

1035
01:49:55,738 --> 01:49:57,615
Fools. Bureaucratic fools.

1036
01:49:57,740 --> 01:49:58,740
What'd they say?

1037
01:49:58,866 --> 01:50:01,868
They don't know what they've got there.

1038
01:50:01,993 --> 01:50:05,371
Well, I know what I've got here.

1039
01:50:05,371 --> 01:50:06,622
Come on.

1040
01:50:06,747 --> 01:50:08,749
I'll buy you a drink.

1041
01:50:10,125 --> 01:50:12,085
You know...

1042
01:50:12,127 --> 01:50:14,087
...a drink?

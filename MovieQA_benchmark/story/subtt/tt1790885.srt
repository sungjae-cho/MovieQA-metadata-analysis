00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,074


2
00:00:45,911 --> 00:00:47,876
<i>United 1523, did you
hear your company, did you hear...</i>

3
00:00:47,911 --> 00:00:48,911
<i>...couple of
minutes ago, screaming.</i>

4
00:00:49,012 --> 00:00:50,321
<i>We did hear that, uh, yelling too.</i>

5
00:00:50,345 --> 00:00:52,267
<i>Yes I did, 797, and, uh,
we couldn’t tell what it was either.</i>

6
00:00:52,302 --> 00:00:53,949
<i>...trying to figure out
what’s going on... United 93, Cleveland.</i>

7
00:00:54,984 --> 00:00:56,149
<i>American Airlines emergency
line, please state your emergency.</i>

8
00:00:56,184 --> 00:00:58,346
<i>The flight attendant
is advising our reps that the pilot...</i>

9
00:00:58,381 --> 00:00:59,969
<i>Everyone’s been stabbed
And um, I think there's Mace</i>

10
00:01:00,012 --> 00:01:02,210
<i>...that we can’t breathe. I
dont know I think we’re getting hijacked</i>

11
00:01:02,234 --> 00:01:03,765
<i>Hijacked aircraft
headed towards New York.</i>

12
00:01:03,789 --> 00:01:04,987
<i>Is this real world or exercise?</i>

13
00:01:05,012 --> 00:01:06,210
<i>No, this is not an exercise.</i>

14
00:01:06,497 --> 00:01:07,922
<i>Can anybody get up to the cockpit?</i>

15
00:01:07,957 --> 00:01:10,429
<i>What's going
on, Betty? Betty, talk to me.</i>

16
00:01:10,464 --> 00:01:12,261
<i>A plane's crashed
into the World Trade Center...</i>

17
00:01:12,296 --> 00:01:14,031
<i>I think we might have lost her.</i>

18
00:01:14,388 --> 00:01:15,599
<i>Hey, Ma, sure that you've heard...</i>

19
00:01:15,634 --> 00:01:18,332
<i>that a plane
crashed into World Trade Center One.</i>

20
00:01:18,349 --> 00:01:20,274
<i>Baby, you have
to listen to me carefully.</i>

21
00:01:20,309 --> 00:01:22,020
<i>I'm on a plane that's been hijacked.</i>

22
00:01:22,055 --> 00:01:24,829
<i>I hope to be able
to see your face again, baby.</i>

23
00:01:24,864 --> 00:01:27,199
<i>I love you! Goodbye!</i>

24
00:01:27,234 --> 00:01:29,668
<i>...of another incoming
plane. We may have to take cover.</i>

25
00:01:38,396 --> 00:01:40,172
<i>Are they gonna
be able to get somebody up here?</i>

26
00:01:40,418 --> 00:01:41,885
<i>Of course,
ma'am, we're coming up to you.</i>

27
00:01:41,963 --> 00:01:45,002
<i>Well, there's no one here
yet and the floor is completely engulfed</i>

28
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:46,909
<i>We're on the
floor and we can't breathe.</i>

29
00:01:46,944 --> 00:01:49,147
<i>Hold for one second, please
I'm gonna die, aren't I?</i>

30
00:01:49,182 --> 00:01:51,286
<i>- No, no, no, no, no, no.
- I think I'm gonna die.</i>

31
00:01:51,321 --> 00:01:52,797
<i>Ma'am, ma'am, now, I'm gonna die.</i>

32
00:01:52,908 --> 00:01:55,710
<i>Look, stay calm,
stay calm, stay calm, stay calm.</i>

33
00:01:55,745 --> 00:01:56,743
<i>Please, God...</i>

34
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:59,114
<i>You're doing a good
job, ma'am, you're doing a good job.</i>

35
00:01:59,149 --> 00:02:01,991
<i>No, it's so hot, I'm burning up.</i>

36
00:02:02,026 --> 00:02:03,955
<i>...fine,
they're gonna come get you.</i>

37
00:02:04,449 --> 00:02:06,044
<i>Can anyone hear me?</i>

38
00:02:06,244 --> 00:02:08,206
<i>Oh, my God...</i>

39
00:02:28,658 --> 00:02:30,235
I own you, Ammar.

40
00:02:31,167 --> 00:02:32,920
You belong to me.

41
00:02:35,374 --> 00:02:36,589
Look at me.

42
00:02:39,561 --> 00:02:42,216
You don't look at me when
I talk to you, I hurt you!

43
00:02:42,514 --> 00:02:44,670
You step off this mat, I hurt you!

44
00:02:44,935 --> 00:02:49,060
If you lie to me, I'm gonna
hurt you! Now! Now, look at me!

45
00:02:50,254 --> 00:02:52,494
Look at me, Ammar!

46
00:02:56,062 --> 00:02:56,788
Come on.

47
00:03:23,176 --> 00:03:25,206
- Nobody talks to him.
- Roger that.

48
00:03:25,579 --> 00:03:27,817
Are we gonna board
these windows up or what?

49
00:03:33,922 --> 00:03:36,048
Just off the plane from Washington,

50
00:03:37,802 --> 00:03:40,692
rocking your best suit for
your first interrogation,

51
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:42,208
and you get this guy.

52
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,232
- They're not always this intense.
- I'm fine.

53
00:03:48,862 --> 00:03:50,011
Well, just so you know,

54
00:03:51,146 --> 00:03:54,635
it's gonna take a while. He
has to learn how helpless he is.

55
00:03:58,922 --> 00:04:00,276
Come on, let's get a coffee.

56
00:04:00,744 --> 00:04:02,409
No, we should go back in.

57
00:04:09,597 --> 00:04:12,049
You know, it's no shame if you
wanna watch from the monitor.

58
00:04:16,404 --> 00:04:17,459
All right.

59
00:04:22,631 --> 00:04:23,989
Might wanna put this on.

60
00:04:24,666 --> 00:04:25,837
You're not wearing one?

61
00:04:28,541 --> 00:04:29,918
Is he ever getting out?

62
00:04:31,057 --> 00:04:32,032
Never.

63
00:04:32,769 --> 00:04:33,651
Let's go.

64
00:04:48,326 --> 00:04:49,536
Right now,

65
00:04:50,417 --> 00:04:52,122
all this is about, simply,

66
00:04:52,577 --> 00:04:55,767
is you coming to terms
with your situation.

67
00:04:56,812 --> 00:04:58,184
It's you and me, bro.

68
00:04:59,965 --> 00:05:02,217
I want you to understand that I know you

69
00:05:04,254 --> 00:05:08,009
that I've been studying and
following you for a very long time.

70
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:11,216
That I could've had you killed
in Karachi, but I didn't.

71
00:05:11,273 --> 00:05:14,487
I let you live, so that
you and I could talk.

72
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:17,574
Then you beat me when my hands are tied.

73
00:05:19,033 --> 00:05:20,350
So I won't talk to you.

74
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:22,469
Well, life isn't always fair, my friend.

75
00:05:23,649 --> 00:05:25,023
Did you really think...

76
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:27,987
that when we got you, "I
would get a nice fucking guy"?

77
00:05:28,659 --> 00:05:33,209
You're a mid-level guy. You're
a garbageman in the corporation!

78
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:35,809
What should I respect you, huh?

79
00:05:36,017 --> 00:05:38,659
- Why?
- And you're a moneyman.

80
00:05:40,642 --> 00:05:41,771
Paperboy.

81
00:05:42,335 --> 00:05:47,050
A disgrace to humanity. You and your
uncle murdered 3,000 innocent people.

82
00:05:48,827 --> 00:05:49,696
Yeah.

83
00:05:51,192 --> 00:05:52,515
I have your name...

84
00:05:52,983 --> 00:05:58,284
on a $5,000 transfer via
Western Union to a 9/11 hijacker.

85
00:06:00,807 --> 00:06:02,287
And you got popped...

86
00:06:02,452 --> 00:06:07,854
with 150 kilograms of high
explosives in your house!

87
00:06:09,628 --> 00:06:12,396
And then you dare question me?

88
00:06:18,323 --> 00:06:19,666
Come on, man, I'm fucking with you.

89
00:06:21,934 --> 00:06:23,993
No, I don't want to talk about 9/11 yet.

90
00:06:26,038 --> 00:06:29,499
What I want to focus
on is the Saudi group.

91
00:06:35,069 --> 00:06:38,551
That, there, is Hazem al-Kashmiri.

92
00:06:39,907 --> 00:06:41,858
And I know this dude is
up to some serious shit.

93
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:45,116
What I want from you is his Saudi e-mail

94
00:06:47,417 --> 00:06:49,379
Ammar, bro, I know
that you know this dude.

95
00:06:49,414 --> 00:06:51,988
Just give me his e-mail, and I
will-I will give you a blanket.

96
00:06:52,358 --> 00:06:54,595
I will give you a blanket
and some solid food.

97
00:06:59,006 --> 00:07:01,483
I know that you know him.

98
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:06,163
I told you before, I won't talk to you.

99
00:07:11,158 --> 00:07:12,622
Have it your way. Let's go.

100
00:07:14,762 --> 00:07:15,504
Come on.

101
00:07:18,891 --> 00:07:22,234
When you lie to me, I hurt you.

102
00:07:42,566 --> 00:07:43,519
Grab me the bucket.

103
00:07:44,217 --> 00:07:45,924
- Huh?
- Grab the bucket.

104
00:07:52,478 --> 00:07:53,585
Put some water in it.

105
00:07:55,841 --> 00:07:57,241
Come on, let's go.

106
00:08:01,965 --> 00:08:02,976
Come on, give it to me.

107
00:08:06,636 --> 00:08:11,150
Hazem was a friend of Ramzi Yousef. You
guys met in Iran back in the nineties.

108
00:08:11,185 --> 00:08:12,948
I don't know!

109
00:08:15,572 --> 00:08:16,652
Fuck you!

110
00:08:22,447 --> 00:08:25,092
I want the e-mails of the
rest of the Saudi group.

111
00:08:26,027 --> 00:08:28,504
Give me one e-mail and I will stop this.

112
00:08:29,585 --> 00:08:31,045
Who's in the Saudi group?

113
00:08:31,539 --> 00:08:32,942
And what's the target?

114
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:36,532
Where was the last
time you saw bin Laden?

115
00:08:36,752 --> 00:08:40,156
Where was the last time
you saw bin Laden, huh?

116
00:08:41,003 --> 00:08:43,070
You know when you lie to me, I hurt you.

117
00:08:53,001 --> 00:08:55,335
This is what defeat looks like, bro.

118
00:08:55,693 --> 00:08:57,281
Your jihad is over.

119
00:09:00,128 --> 00:09:00,909
Get him up.

120
00:09:12,202 --> 00:09:14,181
Try to understand the concept here.

121
00:09:15,017 --> 00:09:16,844
Okay, I have time. You don't.

122
00:09:17,396 --> 00:09:19,582
I have other things to do but you don't.

123
00:09:23,988 --> 00:09:27,134
It'-it's cool that you're
strong. I respect it, I do.

124
00:09:28,293 --> 00:09:32,623
But in the end, everybody
breaks, bro. That's biology.

125
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,955
Can you open the trunk, ma'am?

126
00:10:26,706 --> 00:10:27,777
It's clear.

127
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:18,661
How'd it go the other night?

128
00:11:18,929 --> 00:11:22,017
It was good. I mean the local cops
need a little tactical help, but...

129
00:11:22,395 --> 00:11:24,703
he's tier-fucking-one, baby.
That's your money maker right there.

130
00:11:24,819 --> 00:11:26,343
And this is the guy that's KSM's nephew.

131
00:11:26,358 --> 00:11:27,528
- Yeah.
- And what's his issue?

132
00:11:27,547 --> 00:11:28,533
He's being a dick.

133
00:11:28,568 --> 00:11:30,844
Well, if he's tying to outsmart you,
why don't you tell him about your PhD?

134
00:11:30,872 --> 00:11:33,423
Yeah. No, but I am gonna have to
turn up the heat on this asshole.

135
00:11:33,956 --> 00:11:35,690
He needs to give up the Saudi group now.

136
00:11:35,777 --> 00:11:37,430
He's gotta have that,
given the family ties.

137
00:11:37,478 --> 00:11:40,311
He's tight with his uncle. He's
got his prints all over 9/11 money.

138
00:11:40,664 --> 00:11:42,835
He's got 'em in his head,
he needs to disclose 'em.

139
00:11:44,504 --> 00:11:45,331
Good.

140
00:11:46,253 --> 00:11:48,737
Bill, she's good to go. I'll
get her the right one tomorrow.

141
00:11:51,437 --> 00:11:52,888
Was I lying or what?

142
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:57,923
Uh, Maya, this is Joseph Bradley,
our illustrious station chief.

143
00:11:57,958 --> 00:11:59,324
Joe and I did Iraq together.

144
00:11:59,378 --> 00:12:01,601
- It's nice to meet you.
- You too, sir.

145
00:12:01,983 --> 00:12:04,368
- How's your flight?
- Fine.

146
00:12:04,381 --> 00:12:07,126
Um, she's been having a great time
since she got in, isn't that right?

147
00:12:07,547 --> 00:12:10,827
- Good. How do you like Pakistan so far?
- It's kinda fucked up.

148
00:12:11,651 --> 00:12:14,335
- You volunteered for this, didn't you?
- No.

149
00:12:20,355 --> 00:12:22,136
Third floor, northeast corner.

150
00:12:29,222 --> 00:12:31,425
You don't think she's a little
young for the hard stuff?

151
00:12:32,631 --> 00:12:35,081
- Washington says she's a killer.
- Hmm.

152
00:12:35,601 --> 00:12:37,025
Children's crusade, huh?

153
00:12:37,062 --> 00:12:38,714
They wanna put the next
generation on the field.

154
00:12:38,749 --> 00:12:40,679
Listen, I've got a meeting
with ISI in twenty minutes.

155
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:43,430
They're slow-rolling us on Lahore,
you might wanna bitch about that.

156
00:13:08,609 --> 00:13:11,215
Did I tell you this? That, uh, this dude

157
00:13:11,351 --> 00:13:14,103
in Malaysia, tells a Malaysian
station that his nephew...

158
00:13:14,349 --> 00:13:17,138
- works with a guy, who knows a guy...
- Aww, here we go.

159
00:13:17,159 --> 00:13:22,285
No, hold on. He goes to a big
feast in Bangkok, about a year ago.

160
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:25,736
Guest of honor: Osama bin Laden.

161
00:13:26,089 --> 00:13:28,829
- Except if it was Tupac there...
- This is worth 5 million bucks.

162
00:13:28,838 --> 00:13:30,101
You know we gonna have to chase it down.

163
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:32,269
He's like, "Hey, that's
me, man. No job too small."

164
00:13:32,459 --> 00:13:34,295
That's why I have a
gift for you, my friend.

165
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:37,021
Everyone, Agent Maya. Maya, everyone.

166
00:13:37,022 --> 00:13:38,795
Please don't ask her how
it's going with Ammar,

167
00:13:38,796 --> 00:13:40,166
'cause she's not gonna fucking tell you.

168
00:13:40,175 --> 00:13:41,954
Ammar is withholding.

169
00:13:42,298 --> 00:13:46,757
Washington assesses Abu Faraj
as officially the new "Number 3".

170
00:13:46,899 --> 00:13:48,265
He's the best man for it.

171
00:13:49,883 --> 00:13:50,672
Uh, yeah, the...

172
00:13:50,733 --> 00:13:54,057
London station's already asking if
he's contacting anybody in the UK.

173
00:13:54,126 --> 00:13:55,983
- Like we're just keeping it from them?
- Yeah.

174
00:13:56,284 --> 00:13:59,317
Jordanians are being really
helpful with Ammar's transit papers.

175
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:00,713
Any imminent threats in here?

176
00:14:00,815 --> 00:14:04,045
Oh, we've one on the consulate,
the Marriott, it's low-security.

177
00:14:04,055 --> 00:14:08,203
Um, and they've got Maj Khan talking
about, uh, gas stations in the US.

178
00:14:08,296 --> 00:14:09,931
And that's a conversation?

179
00:14:10,003 --> 00:14:13,913
Honestly, there's 600 questions in
there. I'd do Heathrow, the Saudis.

180
00:14:14,199 --> 00:14:16,591
Does it matter what Faraj
thinks about Heathrow?

181
00:14:16,672 --> 00:14:18,428
How much latitude does
he get to pick targets?

182
00:14:18,483 --> 00:14:20,818
Um, I think he'll give up the
Saudis, but Heathrow's gonna be tough.

183
00:14:20,888 --> 00:14:23,638
Anyway, uh... anything from last night?

184
00:14:23,673 --> 00:14:25,948
Qatar Base Six have a bead
on the Arabs that escaped.

185
00:14:25,957 --> 00:14:29,168
They're meeting with ISI this afternoon,
hopefully set up a raid down there.

186
00:14:29,172 --> 00:14:29,932
Great.

187
00:14:30,417 --> 00:14:34,189
And Lahore reporting, ISI was
painfully slow last night, again.

188
00:14:34,288 --> 00:14:36,076
They're beginning to think
it's not incompetence.

189
00:14:36,141 --> 00:14:40,096
Okay, agree. I spoke to the chief
about that. Yeah, anything on bin Laden?

190
00:14:40,135 --> 00:14:41,999
Uh, farmer on the Afghan
border near Tora Bora...

191
00:14:42,039 --> 00:14:43,620
reports a diamond-shaped
pattern in the hills,

192
00:14:43,627 --> 00:14:45,950
tall male in the center of the
diamond, flanked by four guards,

193
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:48,059
consistent with UBL's movements.

194
00:14:48,118 --> 00:14:49,489
That's supposed to be his Royal Guard.

195
00:14:49,496 --> 00:14:51,421
No, that's pre-9/11 behavior.

196
00:14:51,927 --> 00:14:54,342
We have no reason to believe
he's changed security tactics.

197
00:14:54,418 --> 00:14:56,599
We invaded Afghanistan, that's a reason.

198
00:14:59,402 --> 00:15:00,355
Hey, boss. I got a guy,

199
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:03,658
for 5,000 bucks, he can set up a
taxi stand, and snoop around a bit.

200
00:15:03,684 --> 00:15:06,951
No, don't need him. Sorry, the
diamond sighting is bullshit.

201
00:15:07,186 --> 00:15:11,181
Uh, see if the Paks will send someone
to talk to the farmer. Anything else?

202
00:15:12,015 --> 00:15:12,793
No?

203
00:15:13,775 --> 00:15:16,276
All right, let's put some runs
on the board against Faraj, okay?

204
00:15:16,299 --> 00:15:20,279
Talk to the case officers who didn't see
fit to make it today, and "thank" them.

205
00:15:21,982 --> 00:15:23,758
Tora Bora, yeah?

206
00:15:23,793 --> 00:15:24,629
- Uh-huh.
- Good.

207
00:16:19,768 --> 00:16:21,269
Come on, here we go.

208
00:16:22,078 --> 00:16:22,936
Here we go.

209
00:16:29,305 --> 00:16:32,766
All right, let's just, uh...
Let's take it easy today, huh?

210
00:16:54,609 --> 00:16:55,714
You hungry?

211
00:16:58,156 --> 00:17:00,174
Food in here sucks, so I
brought you some of this.

212
00:17:09,034 --> 00:17:10,064
Pretty good, huh?

213
00:17:20,854 --> 00:17:21,976
Richard Reid.

214
00:17:23,421 --> 00:17:25,153
Oh, man, I was thinking about him.

215
00:17:25,478 --> 00:17:29,223
The guy gets a bomb in a shoe on
a plane. Un-fucking-believable.

216
00:17:30,181 --> 00:17:31,349
You know him, don't you?

217
00:17:36,101 --> 00:17:36,998
Yes.

218
00:17:38,761 --> 00:17:40,304
I'm glad you said that.

219
00:17:42,446 --> 00:17:48,201
Okay, uh, I got an e-mail from you to
him, with all your comms for years, bro.

220
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:52,109
Who, um...

221
00:17:53,617 --> 00:17:55,453
Who else is in your Saudi group?

222
00:17:57,064 --> 00:17:59,668
I just handed out some cash for them.

223
00:18:01,974 --> 00:18:04,338
I didn't know who the guys were.

224
00:18:07,731 --> 00:18:11,047
When you lie to me, I hurt you.

225
00:18:13,012 --> 00:18:14,321
Please.

226
00:18:22,945 --> 00:18:26,428
I believe you. I do, I believe you.

227
00:18:31,604 --> 00:18:32,783
It's good, huh?

228
00:18:39,035 --> 00:18:40,810
Do you want the water again?

229
00:18:41,789 --> 00:18:43,453
Or do you want something else?

230
00:18:50,681 --> 00:18:52,766
- Water?
- Please.

231
00:18:52,801 --> 00:18:55,436
Just... give me a name.

232
00:18:57,828 --> 00:19:02,825
I don't know!

233
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:04,190
Come on, let's go!

234
00:19:06,931 --> 00:19:07,837
Bring him up.

235
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:09,142
Here we go.

236
00:19:10,058 --> 00:19:11,533
You see how this works?

237
00:19:16,665 --> 00:19:19,438
You don't mind if my female colleague
here checks out your junk, do you?

238
00:19:19,865 --> 00:19:21,107
No? Good.

239
00:19:23,737 --> 00:19:25,126
Dude, you shit your pants?

240
00:19:27,001 --> 00:19:28,408
You stay here, I'll be back.

241
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:44,643
Your friend is an animal.

242
00:19:46,792 --> 00:19:48,991
Please, help me.

243
00:19:50,786 --> 00:19:51,860
Please.

244
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:01,745
You can help yourself by being truthful.

245
00:20:13,908 --> 00:20:15,244
This is a dog collar.

246
00:20:19,638 --> 00:20:23,831
- No!
- Hang on.

247
00:20:28,913 --> 00:20:30,690
You determine how I treat you.

248
00:20:37,519 --> 00:20:38,332
Come on.

249
00:20:42,121 --> 00:20:43,069
I got you.

250
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:50,652
Come on.

251
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:53,801
Come on.

252
00:20:54,774 --> 00:20:56,324
You're my dog, I gotta walk you.

253
00:20:58,271 --> 00:21:00,070
What the fuck do you
think is going on, Ammar?

254
00:21:00,458 --> 00:21:04,162
Walid has already told
me that you know, hmm?

255
00:21:07,213 --> 00:21:09,881
Here we go.

256
00:21:11,492 --> 00:21:14,796
This box here. This box sucks.

257
00:21:16,224 --> 00:21:17,546
And I'm gonna put you in it.

258
00:21:22,997 --> 00:21:24,327
When is the attack?

259
00:21:27,365 --> 00:21:28,960
When is the attack?

260
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:32,142
- S...
- What?

261
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:35,533
- What?
- "Ahad. " (Sunday)

262
00:21:37,138 --> 00:21:39,398
Sunday, where? Whoa... Sunday, where?

263
00:21:41,272 --> 00:21:43,436
Sunday. This Sunday or next Sunday?

264
00:21:45,298 --> 00:21:47,516
Where?

265
00:21:50,231 --> 00:21:51,209
What?

266
00:21:53,697 --> 00:21:56,158
Come on, Ammar, is it Sunday or Monday?

267
00:21:57,780 --> 00:22:00,697
Partial information will be
treated as a lie. Come on, let's go.

268
00:22:01,473 --> 00:22:02,950
Come on, which day is it?

269
00:22:03,451 --> 00:22:06,269
Partial information... You
gonna go in the box, huh?

270
00:22:06,374 --> 00:22:10,591
Partial information is
treated as a lie! Let's go!

271
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:14,677
- Saturday!
- In the box you go!

272
00:22:14,683 --> 00:22:17,177
- Sunday!
- Almost.

273
00:22:17,583 --> 00:22:19,725
Monday!

274
00:22:20,565 --> 00:22:24,245
- Tuesday!
- Huh? There we go.

275
00:22:24,253 --> 00:22:27,076
- Friday!
- Come on, let's go! Come on!

276
00:22:29,165 --> 00:22:31,819
- Hang on...
- Sunday.

277
00:22:34,017 --> 00:22:37,120
- Monday.
- Shh...

278
00:22:38,649 --> 00:22:39,878
Thursd...

279
00:22:40,635 --> 00:22:43,040
Ammar, which day is it?

280
00:22:44,001 --> 00:22:45,073
Which day?

281
00:22:50,658 --> 00:22:51,696
Frid...

282
00:22:54,368 --> 00:22:57,430
- Ammar, which day?
- Thursd...

283
00:23:00,791 --> 00:23:01,688
Frid...

284
00:23:19,985 --> 00:23:21,041
"Yalla! Yalla! Yalla!" (Let's go!)

285
00:23:25,108 --> 00:23:26,359
"Yalla! Yalla! Yalla!"

286
00:23:28,413 --> 00:23:31,617
<i>...attack against
westerners and foreigners.</i>

287
00:23:31,652 --> 00:23:33,835
<i>When you look at the
break-up of casualties,</i>

288
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:38,714
<i>you can see that non-muslims were
killed, and so were Americans...</i>

289
00:23:39,136 --> 00:23:41,542
You don't worry about the Saudis,
they'll take care of business.

290
00:23:42,433 --> 00:23:43,325
Yeah, now.

291
00:23:45,529 --> 00:23:47,195
You warned them, they
didn't take you seriously.

292
00:23:47,201 --> 00:23:48,997
This is what happens. It's not on you.

293
00:23:49,009 --> 00:23:53,076
Oh, and who said that, huh? Zayid? Fuck
him. This is on me. Ammar is on me,

294
00:23:53,089 --> 00:23:55,986
- and it's on her. And, we do not,
- No, no, no. Now, you had what, days?

295
00:23:55,999 --> 00:23:58,619
- we cannot let this be a win-win for AQ
- Brief custody, unresponsive ally.

296
00:23:58,626 --> 00:24:00,057
The way you do this, is look ahead.

297
00:24:00,069 --> 00:24:02,870
London, Heathrow, mass casualties.
The plan is still active.

298
00:24:02,964 --> 00:24:04,858
Ammar doesn't have a
clue about what happened.

299
00:24:04,945 --> 00:24:06,718
- Oh, he knows.
- How?

300
00:24:06,766 --> 00:24:10,028
Oh, you have to be really careful with
people in KSM's circle, they're devious.

301
00:24:10,235 --> 00:24:12,277
He's not gonna talk about
attacks in the homeland.

302
00:24:12,278 --> 00:24:15,433
He's gonna withhold operational
details on the KSM network...

303
00:24:15,434 --> 00:24:17,470
and probably bin Laden.

304
00:24:18,275 --> 00:24:19,871
But he's been in complete isolation.

305
00:24:19,906 --> 00:24:22,355
He doesn't know we've failed.
We could tell him anything.

306
00:24:22,825 --> 00:24:23,851
What? Bluff him?

307
00:24:24,749 --> 00:24:27,201
He hasn't slept in. He's clueless.

308
00:24:33,174 --> 00:24:34,517
You don't remember, do you?

309
00:24:34,951 --> 00:24:37,769
Well, short-term memory loss is a
side effect of sleep deprivation,

310
00:24:37,773 --> 00:24:39,199
so it should come back to you.

311
00:24:42,524 --> 00:24:43,914
I don't know.

312
00:24:45,805 --> 00:24:47,394
How can I remember?

313
00:24:47,404 --> 00:24:50,517
After we kept you awake for 96 hours you

314
00:24:51,229 --> 00:24:52,655
gave us the names of
some of your brothers,

315
00:24:52,747 --> 00:24:55,696
and you helped save the lives
of a lot of innocent people.

316
00:24:56,202 --> 00:24:58,522
Which is a smart thing to do when
you're starting to think for yourself.

317
00:24:58,673 --> 00:24:59,414
Mm-hm.

318
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:01,344
Come on, eat up, man.

319
00:25:01,412 --> 00:25:07,400
Some hummus, tabbouleh, don't know
what that is, some figs. You earned it.

320
00:25:13,139 --> 00:25:16,758
So uh you flew via Amman to Kabul, yeah?

321
00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:19,757
Hang out with your uncle.

322
00:25:20,652 --> 00:25:21,692
Mukhtar.

323
00:25:23,218 --> 00:25:26,275
- How did you know that?
- I told you, man, I know you.

324
00:25:27,607 --> 00:25:29,541
All right, you got me.
You did, you got me.

325
00:25:30,074 --> 00:25:31,675
Flight manifests.

326
00:25:32,850 --> 00:25:35,558
It must be pretty fucked
up for you guys after 9/11.

327
00:25:35,929 --> 00:25:39,156
And what did you do, um, what
did you do after the invasion?

328
00:25:39,470 --> 00:25:41,066
Before you went back to Pesh?

329
00:25:41,737 --> 00:25:44,262
After 9/11, we had to choose.

330
00:25:44,776 --> 00:25:47,234
Fight to protect our turf or run.

331
00:25:47,278 --> 00:25:49,213
And you chose to fight, yeah?

332
00:25:51,149 --> 00:25:53,134
We wanted to kill Americans.

333
00:25:53,790 --> 00:25:54,529
Yeah.

334
00:25:55,073 --> 00:25:59,859
We tried to get into Tora Bora, but the
bombing was too high. We couldn't cross.

335
00:26:00,476 --> 00:26:03,082
I'm sorry, who's the
"we" in that sentence?

336
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:09,172
Me, and some other guys who
were hanging around at that time.

337
00:26:09,817 --> 00:26:11,782
You know, I can always go
and eat with some other dude,

338
00:26:11,795 --> 00:26:13,547
hang you back up to the ceiling.

339
00:26:17,027 --> 00:26:18,686
Hamza Rabia.

340
00:26:24,998 --> 00:26:26,505
Khabab al-Masri.

341
00:26:32,392 --> 00:26:33,956
And Abu Ahmed.

342
00:26:39,082 --> 00:26:41,282
Who's Abu Ahmed? I've
heard of the other guys.

343
00:26:41,817 --> 00:26:44,347
He was a computer guy
with us at the time.

344
00:26:47,190 --> 00:26:52,091
After Tora Bora, I went
back to Pesh, as you know.

345
00:26:52,133 --> 00:26:53,060
Mm-hm.

346
00:26:53,639 --> 00:26:56,377
And they went north, I think, to Kunar.

347
00:26:56,409 --> 00:26:57,726
What's his family name?

348
00:26:58,527 --> 00:27:00,617
Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti.

349
00:27:02,477 --> 00:27:05,987
Abu Ahmed means "father
of Ahmed", it's a kunya.

350
00:27:07,007 --> 00:27:10,203
Ammar, I know the difference between
a war name and an Arabic name.

351
00:27:10,272 --> 00:27:11,409
She got you there, dude.

352
00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:16,266
I swear to you both, I
don't know his family name.

353
00:27:17,223 --> 00:27:21,748
I would have never asked him something
like that. It's not how my uncle worked.

354
00:27:21,759 --> 00:27:22,636
I know.

355
00:27:24,345 --> 00:27:27,013
My uncle told me he worked for bin Laden

356
00:27:30,276 --> 00:27:35,001
Um, I did see him, once,
about a year ago, in Karachi.

357
00:27:40,893 --> 00:27:43,018
He read us all a letter
from the "Sheik".

358
00:27:43,769 --> 00:27:44,608
A letter?

359
00:27:45,144 --> 00:27:46,213
What'd it say?

360
00:27:46,946 --> 00:27:47,815
Cigarette?

361
00:27:59,396 --> 00:28:01,523
It said, "Continue the jihad."

362
00:28:02,618 --> 00:28:05,854
"The work will go on
for a hundred years."

363
00:28:10,733 --> 00:28:14,989
<i>You and I are gonna talk about some of
the guys at the training camps, yeah?</i>

364
00:28:15,029 --> 00:28:16,032
<i>Okay.</i>

365
00:28:16,697 --> 00:28:19,709
<i>Some of these brothers
have done some bad things.</i>

366
00:28:19,728 --> 00:28:24,328
<i>What I wanna do is, I wanna separate
them from the people like you.</i>

367
00:28:24,331 --> 00:28:25,950
<i>Definitely, yeah.</i>

368
00:28:26,046 --> 00:28:30,530
<i>All right, a guy called
Abu Ahmed, from Kuwait.</i>

369
00:28:30,565 --> 00:28:33,111
<i>Yes, I remember him. The nice guy.</i>

370
00:28:33,126 --> 00:28:36,384
<i>How close was he? What was his
relationship to the leadership?</i>

371
00:28:36,561 --> 00:28:37,485
<i>I don't know.</i>

372
00:28:37,514 --> 00:28:38,281
<i>Did he eat with you guys?</i>

373
00:28:38,337 --> 00:28:40,335
<i>Did he eat with the good guys,
or did he eat with the leadership?</i>

374
00:28:40,431 --> 00:28:42,659
<i>I don't know, sir. I
have no idea about it.</i>

375
00:28:42,670 --> 00:28:44,966
<i>That's something you
don't need an idea about.</i>

376
00:28:48,745 --> 00:28:53,016
<i>When you met Khalid Sheikh Mohammed,
was this one of the facilitators?</i>

377
00:28:54,685 --> 00:28:56,559
<i>Is this Abu Ahmed?</i>

378
00:29:04,659 --> 00:29:08,005
<i>- KSM, your boss.
- Mukhtar.</i>

379
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:09,452
<i>"Mukhtar"... "Potato"...</i>

380
00:29:09,487 --> 00:29:13,342
<i>You say, "Po-tah-to"; I say, "Fucking
KSM"; you say, "Mukhtar", okay?</i>

381
00:29:13,392 --> 00:29:16,732
<i>Now, after Mukhtar was
captured, what did Abu Ahmed do?</i>

382
00:29:17,507 --> 00:29:21,703
<i>Abu Ahmed. I believe... I believe,
he went to work for the "Sheik".</i>

383
00:29:46,238 --> 00:29:47,055
<i>Is that him?</i>

384
00:29:50,667 --> 00:29:52,406
<i>- Say it.
- Abu Ahmed.</i>

385
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:55,448
<i>- Say it again.
- Abu Ahmed.</i>

386
00:29:56,559 --> 00:29:58,751
<i>Abu Ahmed.</i>

387
00:30:01,576 --> 00:30:02,869
<i>Abu Ahmed.</i>

388
00:30:39,743 --> 00:30:41,812
How's the needle in the haystack?

389
00:30:43,177 --> 00:30:44,202
Fine.

390
00:30:46,108 --> 00:30:47,421
Facilitators come and go.

391
00:30:47,422 --> 00:30:50,888
One thing you can count on in
life is that everyone wants money.

392
00:30:51,617 --> 00:30:55,209
You're assuming that al-Qaeda members
are motivated by financial rewards.

393
00:30:55,515 --> 00:30:56,637
They're radicals.

394
00:30:58,309 --> 00:31:00,610
Correct. You're assuming that, uh,

395
00:31:00,662 --> 00:31:04,242
greed won't override ideology
in some of the weaker members.

396
00:31:04,348 --> 00:31:07,390
Money for walk-ins worked great in
the Cold War, I'll give you that.

397
00:31:08,110 --> 00:31:09,145
Thank you.

398
00:31:49,123 --> 00:31:50,902
He says it looks like Abu Ahmed.

399
00:31:51,717 --> 00:31:52,995
Who did he work for?

400
00:32:02,918 --> 00:32:06,898
He was mostly with Abu Faraj.
They were always together.

401
00:32:07,302 --> 00:32:08,948
What did he do for Faraj?

402
00:32:17,154 --> 00:32:19,547
He carried messages from
Abu Faraj to bin Laden,

403
00:32:19,555 --> 00:32:21,512
from bin Laden back to Abu Faraj.

404
00:32:21,805 --> 00:32:24,266
We need to ask him something to
see if he's telling the truth.

405
00:32:24,285 --> 00:32:26,119
We don't know if he really knew Faraj.

406
00:32:38,343 --> 00:32:41,692
He just told me the names of
all of Abu Faraj's children.

407
00:32:42,441 --> 00:32:44,127
I think he's telling the truth.

408
00:32:47,209 --> 00:32:49,670
Twenty detainees recognized
that photo of Abu Ahmed.

409
00:32:49,702 --> 00:32:50,904
They say he's part of an inner circle...

410
00:32:50,923 --> 00:32:53,561
of guys that was hanging
out in Afghanistan pre-9/11.

411
00:32:53,572 --> 00:32:56,714
A lot of them say that after
9/11, he went to work for KSM.

412
00:32:56,743 --> 00:32:59,189
When KSM was captured, he
went to work for Abu Faraj.

413
00:32:59,224 --> 00:33:02,208
Primarily as a courier,
from Faraj to bin Laden.

414
00:33:02,515 --> 00:33:03,947
That's good, but you still don't have...

415
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:05,713
Yeah, but we don't know if Abu's
on the outside of the network.

416
00:33:05,718 --> 00:33:06,958
A series of cut-outs and dead drops,

417
00:33:06,993 --> 00:33:09,741
or if he has a direct
connection to bin Laden.

418
00:33:09,846 --> 00:33:11,790
I mean, does bin Laden invite
him into the living room,

419
00:33:11,808 --> 00:33:14,588
and hand him a letter directly,
or is Abu just the last guy...

420
00:33:14,592 --> 00:33:16,876
in a long line of couriers, and
that's why everybody knows him.

421
00:33:16,888 --> 00:33:19,123
That's not all you don't know.
You don't have his real name.

422
00:33:19,142 --> 00:33:21,766
- You don't have a clue of where he is.
- Yes, but we know that he's important.

423
00:33:21,815 --> 00:33:23,749
The fact that everybody's
heard of Abu Ahmed,

424
00:33:23,757 --> 00:33:26,349
but nobody will tell me
where he is, suggests that.

425
00:33:26,872 --> 00:33:28,111
Maybe.

426
00:33:28,454 --> 00:33:30,802
Detainees can withhold his
location for any number of reasons.

427
00:33:30,807 --> 00:33:31,951
Perhaps they don't know.

428
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:35,823
Perhaps this "Abu" is actually a cover
story and he's really a fucking unicorn.

429
00:33:36,177 --> 00:33:39,223
But the withholding doesn't reveal
what you want it to, does it?

430
00:33:41,287 --> 00:33:42,082
No.

431
00:33:42,803 --> 00:33:45,568
And if you did find him, you don't
know that he'd be with bin Laden.

432
00:33:45,586 --> 00:33:47,000
We don't know what we don't know.

433
00:33:47,035 --> 00:33:48,803
What the fuck is that supposed to mean?

434
00:33:51,637 --> 00:33:52,798
It's tautology.

435
00:33:55,933 --> 00:33:59,112
Listen, not one single detainee has said
that he's been located with the big guy.

436
00:33:59,147 --> 00:34:01,380
Just that he delivers
messages, am I wrong?

437
00:34:02,591 --> 00:34:04,571
No.

438
00:34:07,273 --> 00:34:11,081
It's still good work. Let me know when
you've got some actual intelligence.

439
00:34:11,116 --> 00:34:13,185
Preferably, something
that leads to a strike.

440
00:34:52,785 --> 00:34:55,433
<i>This is what remains of the No. 10 bus,</i>

441
00:34:55,639 --> 00:34:59,103
<i>which was travelling through
Tavistock Square, near Euston station.</i>

442
00:34:59,638 --> 00:35:04,816
<i>There'd been explosions near Liverpool
Street and Edgware Road stations too.</i>

443
00:35:05,243 --> 00:35:07,721
<i>Dozens of the survivors
were critically injured,</i>

444
00:35:07,722 --> 00:35:11,107
<i>but many of the wounded were
also keen to share their stories.</i>

445
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,249
<i>We just pulled out of Edgware Road,</i>

446
00:35:14,395 --> 00:35:19,173
<i>and next thing I know, is a
loud, um, large flash of light.</i>

447
00:35:19,879 --> 00:35:23,453
<i>Uh, I felt a burning sensation on my
hands, put my hands up to my face...</i>

448
00:35:24,509 --> 00:35:27,200
<i>Uh, I was on the floor by that point...</i>

449
00:35:28,676 --> 00:35:32,737
<i>Yeah, I can't recall anything prior
to that anymore. Any noise, any bang...</i>

450
00:35:32,758 --> 00:35:37,157
<i>Normal life in one of the busiest parts
of the capital has now been suspended.</i>

451
00:35:37,185 --> 00:35:41,058
<i>Just a few yards down the road here,
they continue to care for the injured.</i>

452
00:35:41,087 --> 00:35:45,962
<i>And all around, groups of Londoners are
standing on corners, asking themselves,</i>

453
00:35:45,963 --> 00:35:49,296
<i>"What has happened here, and who
could possibly have done this?"</i>

454
00:35:55,567 --> 00:35:56,324
Come on.

455
00:36:05,524 --> 00:36:06,818
You too, come on.

456
00:36:17,975 --> 00:36:19,519
You agency guys are twisted.

457
00:36:20,974 --> 00:36:22,323
Detainee's ready for you.

458
00:36:29,156 --> 00:36:30,934
Come on. Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa...

459
00:36:53,833 --> 00:36:55,699
I want you to understand that I know you

460
00:36:56,221 --> 00:36:59,166
I've been following you, and
studying you, for a long time.

461
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:00,651
I chased you in Lahore.

462
00:37:00,686 --> 00:37:02,403
I had you picked up
instead of killing you,

463
00:37:02,439 --> 00:37:05,477
because you're not a violent
man, and you don't deserve to die.

464
00:37:06,010 --> 00:37:06,902
Thank you.

465
00:37:07,275 --> 00:37:10,278
But you do have deep ties to
al-Qaeda I want to ask you about,

466
00:37:10,625 --> 00:37:13,934
before you get sent to your next
location, which might be Israel.

467
00:37:14,302 --> 00:37:17,085
However, depending on how
candid you are here today,

468
00:37:18,049 --> 00:37:20,288
I may be able to keep you in Pakistan.

469
00:37:21,430 --> 00:37:22,792
What do you want to know?

470
00:37:23,337 --> 00:37:26,846
I'm gonna ask you a series of questions,
based on your knowledge of al-Qaeda,

471
00:37:26,881 --> 00:37:29,808
and your position as key
financier for the organization.

472
00:37:29,969 --> 00:37:31,768
I have dealt with the horrors.

473
00:37:32,862 --> 00:37:37,469
I have no wish to be tortured again.
Ask me a question, I will answer it.

474
00:37:37,975 --> 00:37:40,775
What can you tell me
about Atiyah Abdul-Rahman?

475
00:37:41,924 --> 00:37:46,806
He works for Zawahiri. He's
in charge of military tactics.

476
00:37:47,868 --> 00:37:51,088
In what context have you
ever heard the name Abu Ahmed?

477
00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:59,592
He works for Faraj and bin Laden.
He is his most trusted courier.

478
00:38:02,078 --> 00:38:03,571
What makes you say that?

479
00:38:03,659 --> 00:38:06,324
He brought me many
messages from the "Sheik".

480
00:38:12,532 --> 00:38:14,520
Where did you last see
him, and where is he now?

481
00:38:16,446 --> 00:38:19,535
- You will never find him.
- Why is that?

482
00:38:19,570 --> 00:38:24,030
Even I couldn't find him. He
always contacted me out of the blue.

483
00:38:25,902 --> 00:38:28,028
He's one of "the disappeared ones".

484
00:41:02,471 --> 00:41:04,935
You're in luck, I got you
a one-on-one with Faraj.

485
00:41:05,604 --> 00:41:06,929
Seriously? Thank you.

486
00:41:06,964 --> 00:41:09,278
Don't you thank me until
you hear what I want for it.

487
00:41:09,406 --> 00:41:12,085
I want you to take care of all
this before your favorite subject.

488
00:41:12,116 --> 00:41:12,997
Deal.

489
00:41:17,890 --> 00:41:19,422
Don't you wanna see whats in the folder?

490
00:41:19,435 --> 00:41:23,811
You want family ties, financial networks
media sources, disgruntled employees,

491
00:41:23,812 --> 00:41:27,339
imminent threats, homeland plots,
foreign sales, health status,

492
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:31,187
financial resources, tradecraft,
recruiting tactics, anything else?

493
00:41:31,306 --> 00:41:33,684
- No, I think that covers it.
- Yeah.

494
00:41:35,921 --> 00:41:36,698
Huh?

495
00:41:37,704 --> 00:41:41,021
"What they say is true. The Shaolin
and the Wu-Tang could be dangerous."

496
00:41:42,241 --> 00:41:45,978
What do you like to be called?
"Faraj", "Fareej", "Buzzie"?

497
00:41:46,712 --> 00:41:48,477
C'mon, dude, what do you
like? You like a bit of, uh...

498
00:41:49,526 --> 00:41:51,600
You guys like a bit of Bob
Marley, with the Reggae?

499
00:41:52,598 --> 00:41:54,714
Kick back, take it easy after
you've blown some shit up?

500
00:41:55,367 --> 00:41:56,293
Huh?

501
00:41:57,730 --> 00:41:58,594
No?

502
00:41:59,898 --> 00:42:01,620
Got some Libyan music you like?

503
00:42:09,535 --> 00:42:11,085
You did the UK bombings, right?

504
00:42:12,617 --> 00:42:16,415
Well, you're the second "Number
3" I've captured. I got KSM.

505
00:42:24,798 --> 00:42:26,111
Can I be honest with you?

506
00:42:28,551 --> 00:42:30,234
I'm bad fuckin' news.

507
00:42:32,047 --> 00:42:33,190
I'm not your friend.

508
00:42:34,687 --> 00:42:35,835
Not gonna help you.

509
00:42:38,042 --> 00:42:39,196
I'm gonna break you.

510
00:42:41,342 --> 00:42:42,628
Any questions?

511
00:42:44,056 --> 00:42:44,823
No?

512
00:42:46,470 --> 00:42:48,933
All right, you haven't eaten in 18
hours. We need to keep your energy up.

513
00:42:49,322 --> 00:42:50,362
You hungry?

514
00:42:57,306 --> 00:42:58,733
A lot of brothers told us,

515
00:42:58,768 --> 00:43:02,622
Abu Ahmed was Bin Laden's courier, and
that he worked very closely with you.

516
00:43:03,537 --> 00:43:06,641
You are thinking of Abu Khaled.

517
00:43:07,791 --> 00:43:12,620
- Who?
- al-Baluchi, my courier for the "Sheik"

518
00:43:14,868 --> 00:43:19,121
Okay, so you're telling me, all
the other brothers are wrong.

519
00:43:19,234 --> 00:43:22,771
And there's some famous "Baluchi"
guy, working for you and bin Laden,

520
00:43:22,806 --> 00:43:24,482
that I've never even heard of.

521
00:43:24,904 --> 00:43:28,334
- Why should you have heard of him?
- What does this Baluchi guy look like?

522
00:43:29,234 --> 00:43:32,101
Tall. Long white beard.

523
00:43:33,367 --> 00:43:37,949
- Thin. He uses a cane.
- Kinda like Gandalf.

524
00:43:39,226 --> 00:43:40,044
Who?

525
00:43:41,259 --> 00:43:43,167
When was the last time you saw him?

526
00:43:43,734 --> 00:43:47,023
A month ago, in Karachi.

527
00:43:47,186 --> 00:43:52,662
But I don't know where he is now.
Sometimes, I wouldn't even see him.

528
00:43:52,697 --> 00:43:57,520
He would just tell me,
where to leave the messages.

529
00:44:00,922 --> 00:44:03,144
You're not being fulsome in your replies

530
00:44:03,450 --> 00:44:06,761
You cannot force me to tell
you something I don't know.

531
00:44:06,796 --> 00:44:11,062
You do realize this is not a normal
prison? You determine how you're treated

532
00:44:11,097 --> 00:44:13,428
And your life is gonna be
very uncomfortable, until...

533
00:44:13,463 --> 00:44:16,087
you give me the information I need!

534
00:44:18,066 --> 00:44:21,931
Where exactly is Abu
Ahmed living at the moment?

535
00:44:33,683 --> 00:44:36,742
Faraj is completely
denying knowing Abu Ahmed.

536
00:44:39,201 --> 00:44:41,201
That's using every measure we have.

537
00:44:41,336 --> 00:44:42,602
Well, he's either gonna keep withholding

538
00:44:42,735 --> 00:44:44,841
or he's gonna die from the
presssure you're putting on him.

539
00:44:47,370 --> 00:44:49,005
Hey, you wanna take a run at him?

540
00:44:50,935 --> 00:44:51,768
No.

541
00:44:52,669 --> 00:44:53,578
No?

542
00:44:54,049 --> 00:44:56,212
- No.
- Since when? No.

543
00:44:57,450 --> 00:44:59,721
You know, I was meaning to tell
you, I'm getting outta here.

544
00:45:01,936 --> 00:45:04,837
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine, I'm just...

545
00:45:05,846 --> 00:45:07,768
You know, I've seen too many guys naked.

546
00:45:09,469 --> 00:45:10,970
It's gonna be over a fucking
hundred at this point.

547
00:45:11,068 --> 00:45:13,135
I need to go and do
something normal for a while.

548
00:45:14,735 --> 00:45:16,002
Like what?

549
00:45:16,569 --> 00:45:20,214
I'll go to Washington, do the dance,
see how that environment works.

550
00:45:21,786 --> 00:45:22,922
You should come with me.

551
00:45:23,668 --> 00:45:26,436
Yeah, be my number two. You're
looking a little strung out yourself.

552
00:45:28,902 --> 00:45:31,236
I'm not gonna find Abu Ahmed from DC.

553
00:45:38,901 --> 00:45:40,369
They killed my monkeys.

554
00:45:42,101 --> 00:45:44,935
Some bullshit about escaping,
you fucking believe that?

555
00:45:49,002 --> 00:45:50,536
Sorry, Dan.

556
00:45:52,770 --> 00:45:55,604
Look, Maya, you gotta be real
careful with the detainees now.

557
00:45:55,969 --> 00:45:57,887
Okay, politics are changing,
and you don't wanna be...

558
00:45:57,912 --> 00:46:01,211
the last one holding a dog collar,
when the Oversight Committee comes.

559
00:46:02,303 --> 00:46:03,703
- I know.
- Yeah?

560
00:46:05,236 --> 00:46:09,369
And watch your back when you get back to
Pakistan. Everyone knows you there now.

561
00:47:02,203 --> 00:47:05,270
Sorry. Fucking checkpoints.

562
00:47:06,837 --> 00:47:08,338
- Maya?
- Yeah?

563
00:47:09,036 --> 00:47:11,169
We're socializing. Be social.

564
00:47:13,436 --> 00:47:14,503
Okay.

565
00:47:17,770 --> 00:47:22,870
Look, I know Abu Ahmed is your baby,
but it is time to cut the umbilical cord

566
00:47:22,969 --> 00:47:26,172
- No, it's not.
- So Faraj went south on you, it happens

567
00:47:26,207 --> 00:47:28,151
There are still cells
in London and Spain,

568
00:47:28,186 --> 00:47:29,671
who are planning the
next round of attacks.

569
00:47:30,737 --> 00:47:32,804
I could work on it at the same time.

570
00:47:34,370 --> 00:47:35,637
Plus, I think it's a good thing he lied.

571
00:47:35,671 --> 00:47:39,238
No, not at the expense of
protecting the homeland, you can't...

572
00:47:39,404 --> 00:47:40,905
Wait a minute. Why is it a good thing?

573
00:47:41,037 --> 00:47:43,638
You sound just like Bradley. He
doesn't believe in my lead either.

574
00:47:48,274 --> 00:47:49,269
It's a good thing,

575
00:47:49,737 --> 00:47:53,470
because the fact that Faraj withheld
on Abu Ahmed is very revealing.

576
00:47:53,845 --> 00:47:57,686
The only other thing Faraj lied about,
was the location of bin Laden himself.

577
00:47:58,029 --> 00:48:02,783
That means Faraj thinks Abu Ahmed's just
as important to protect as bin Laden.

578
00:48:04,366 --> 00:48:07,811
- That confirms my lead.
- Or it's confirmation bias.

579
00:48:07,970 --> 00:48:09,179
Mmm...

580
00:48:12,095 --> 00:48:14,926
We're just worried about you,
okay? Is that okay to say?

581
00:48:15,503 --> 00:48:18,430
I mean, look how run-down you are.

582
00:48:25,766 --> 00:48:27,673
Where's Jack?

583
00:48:28,194 --> 00:48:30,141
Probably stuck in some
checkpoint, somewhere.

584
00:48:31,568 --> 00:48:32,899
You two hooked up yet?

585
00:48:33,296 --> 00:48:37,730
Hello, I work with him. I'm not that
girl that fucks. It's unbecoming.

586
00:48:39,028 --> 00:48:41,350
So, a little fooling
around wouldn't hurt you.

587
00:48:42,533 --> 00:48:43,897
Hmph...

588
00:48:45,410 --> 00:48:47,237
- So, no boyfriend?
- Mm-mm.

589
00:48:49,048 --> 00:48:50,919
You got any friends at all?

590
00:48:57,233 --> 00:48:58,091
That's Jack.

591
00:48:59,327 --> 00:49:00,201
Hey.

592
00:49:01,399 --> 00:49:02,542
That's okay.

593
00:49:22,422 --> 00:49:23,125
Come on!

594
00:49:28,068 --> 00:49:28,921
Come on!

595
00:49:46,106 --> 00:49:46,861
Go!

596
00:49:48,123 --> 00:49:49,268
Come on, over here!

597
00:50:03,605 --> 00:50:08,738
<i>The blast left a crater, 10 meters or
30 feet wide, in front of the hotel.</i>

598
00:50:08,905 --> 00:50:12,971
<i>Police tell CNN, the driver of the
truck bomb tried to talk his way pass...</i>

599
00:50:13,006 --> 00:50:16,624
<i>the hotel's steel security
gate. When armed guards said no,</i>

600
00:50:16,659 --> 00:50:20,980
<i>police said, the driver detonated
more than 2,000 pounds of explosives.</i>

601
00:50:21,015 --> 00:50:25,094
<i>The Marriott, one of the most popular
destinations for locals and westerners..</i>

602
00:50:25,129 --> 00:50:28,013
<i>in Islamabad, now destroyed.</i>

603
00:50:57,298 --> 00:50:58,820
The Jords have a mole.

604
00:50:59,560 --> 00:51:00,331
What?

605
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:02,347
He made this video to
prove his bona fides.

606
00:51:03,172 --> 00:51:04,789
Shut up.

607
00:51:05,643 --> 00:51:09,318
Humam Khalil al-Balawi.
He's a Jordanian doctor.

608
00:51:11,354 --> 00:51:13,345
He's right there in the inner circle.

609
00:51:15,462 --> 00:51:18,140
I don't buy it. Didn't you tell me
yourself, nobody turns on al-Qaeda?

610
00:51:18,175 --> 00:51:20,771
The Jordans have worked him for a year,
dinners, money. They convinced him...

611
00:51:20,806 --> 00:51:24,349
it's his patriotic duty to turn
on al-Qaeda, and get rich doing it.

612
00:51:24,384 --> 00:51:26,956
- Yeah, well, so the Jords say.
- Yeah, you're right.

613
00:51:27,584 --> 00:51:30,766
We can't rely on this or the Jords.
We've gotta evaluate him face-to-face.

614
00:51:30,801 --> 00:51:32,737
He may not be that smart,
he may be full of shit.

615
00:51:32,772 --> 00:51:34,466
But we have to talk to him and find out.

616
00:51:35,339 --> 00:51:36,376
The key is to meet him,

617
00:51:36,411 --> 00:51:38,516
so we can figure out for
ourselves what he can actually do.

618
00:51:47,919 --> 00:51:50,148
He really asked for a dialysis machine?

619
00:51:53,032 --> 00:51:55,026
Maybe we can fill the
damn thing with poison.

620
00:52:03,062 --> 00:52:06,498
The meeting with Balawi is
off. He can't come to Islamabad.

621
00:52:06,573 --> 00:52:11,191
- Can't or won't?
- He's not gonna travel. Security risk.

622
00:52:12,764 --> 00:52:15,873
<i>...and, uh, I've said repeatedly,
that America doesn't torture.</i>

623
00:52:16,072 --> 00:52:20,184
<i>And I'm gonna make sure that we don't
torture. Those are part and parcel of...</i>

624
00:52:20,474 --> 00:52:26,473
<i>an-an effort to regain, uh,
America's moral stature in the world.</i>

625
00:52:26,573 --> 00:52:28,041
<i>Can you give us some sense
of when you might start...</i>

626
00:52:28,206 --> 00:52:31,422
He... wants us to go to him.

627
00:52:31,624 --> 00:52:35,592
He'll meet us in Maidan
Shar with the Tribals.

628
00:52:36,377 --> 00:52:38,247
He knows you're white,
we'd get kidnapped there.

629
00:52:38,282 --> 00:52:43,405
Could we do it somewhere else? Germany?
in the UK? He's got a clean passport.

630
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:46,371
He's not gonna travel
out of al-Qaeda territory.

631
00:52:46,474 --> 00:52:49,105
- And you're not going to him.
- I'm not, believe me.

632
00:52:50,665 --> 00:52:51,796
We're stuck.

633
00:52:55,442 --> 00:53:00,982
What about Camp Chapman...
Afghanistan? That can be safe territory.

634
00:53:10,702 --> 00:53:13,975
This may be going overboard,
but I baked him a cake.

635
00:53:15,179 --> 00:53:17,447
<i>Muslims don't celebrate with cake.</i>

636
00:53:17,904 --> 00:53:20,208
Don't be so literal, everyone likes cake

637
00:53:20,273 --> 00:53:22,940
<i>It's not too late for you to
come, you know, it'll be fun.</i>

638
00:53:23,006 --> 00:53:25,273
No, I don't want to be a straphanger.

639
00:53:25,533 --> 00:53:28,141
It's your show. You were the
first to see the potential in this.

640
00:53:28,173 --> 00:53:31,599
<i>Oh, come on, we've got lots of wine.</i>

641
00:53:32,102 --> 00:53:33,742
Cool, bring me back a bottle.

642
00:53:34,941 --> 00:53:36,208
<i>That, I will do.</i>

643
00:53:38,013 --> 00:53:39,200
Not to get technical,

644
00:53:40,289 --> 00:53:43,870
but this guy is actually the first
big break we've had since 9/11.

645
00:53:45,306 --> 00:53:48,007
To big breaks, and the little
people that make 'em happen.

646
00:53:51,585 --> 00:53:55,386
So far, everything he's said, we've
cross-checked, and it's proved legit.

647
00:53:55,936 --> 00:53:59,138
And I think the money is persuasive.

648
00:54:00,307 --> 00:54:03,030
25 million dollars?

649
00:54:04,631 --> 00:54:06,190
That buy's a new life.

650
00:54:07,693 --> 00:54:09,943
Do you think he might be
exaggerating his access?

651
00:54:10,744 --> 00:54:11,840
Possibly.

652
00:54:12,849 --> 00:54:16,744
But, al-Qaeda needs doctors, and
they are short-staffed, and...

653
00:54:17,354 --> 00:54:19,145
that could explain his rise.

654
00:54:20,564 --> 00:54:22,003
In six months to a year,

655
00:54:22,324 --> 00:54:26,887
if he doesn't fuck up, he could
be called in to treat bin Laden.

656
00:54:28,837 --> 00:54:33,274
At that moment, with 25 mill on the
table, I think he gives up the big man.

657
00:54:34,905 --> 00:54:36,433
And if he doesn't, we kill him.

658
00:54:50,266 --> 00:54:51,344
- John.
- Yeah.

659
00:54:51,749 --> 00:54:54,175
When he arrives, let me set the
tone, and then I'll flip it to you,

660
00:54:54,210 --> 00:54:56,841
and you can talk about asset protection.

661
00:54:57,007 --> 00:54:58,608
- Roger that.
- Uh, Lauren,

662
00:55:00,179 --> 00:55:04,821
I know you wanna get some questions in
there, but give Balawi a little time.

663
00:55:04,856 --> 00:55:08,612
After John speaks, we'll cover
the basics, have his birthday cake,

664
00:55:08,647 --> 00:55:10,438
then we'll get into the nitty-gritty.

665
00:55:11,141 --> 00:55:15,257
Is that order okay? Or d-do
you wanna introduce everyone?

666
00:55:15,292 --> 00:55:17,153
I'll introduce you,
you introduce your team.

667
00:55:17,188 --> 00:55:19,795
- He knows this is a high-level meeting.
- Quick question.

668
00:55:21,041 --> 00:55:23,163
All this taking place
inside our main building?

669
00:55:23,198 --> 00:55:26,377
Right, and, uh, Lauren,
Washington will want...

670
00:55:26,419 --> 00:55:29,140
real-time updates, so
please, stay on top of that.

671
00:55:29,621 --> 00:55:31,424
Be concise, the director's in the loop.

672
00:55:32,729 --> 00:55:34,290
And I wouldn't be surprised,

673
00:55:36,086 --> 00:55:37,775
if he doesn't update the president.

674
00:55:38,678 --> 00:55:39,650
Yeah, I'm on it.

675
00:55:40,474 --> 00:55:42,852
Now, I just gotta get his ass down here.

676
00:57:28,552 --> 00:57:30,197
Why are there gate guards there?

677
00:57:30,232 --> 00:57:32,776
We talked about this, no one is supposed
to be there when my source arrives.

678
00:57:32,810 --> 00:57:34,558
You might have spooked him already.

679
00:57:34,593 --> 00:57:37,144
Well, procedures only work
if we follow them every time.

680
00:57:37,176 --> 00:57:41,198
This is different. I'm sorry, I can't
explain, but it's for a good cause.

681
00:57:42,108 --> 00:57:45,777
Look, I'm responsible for everybody's
safety, okay. It's not just about you.

682
00:57:45,829 --> 00:57:47,407
I just need them to go away for a minute

683
00:57:47,441 --> 00:57:49,061
You can search him as
soon as he gets here.

684
00:57:53,677 --> 00:57:56,592
All stations, this is Whiplash.

685
00:57:56,759 --> 00:57:58,119
<i>Go ahead and stand down.</i>

686
00:57:58,977 --> 00:57:59,911
Copy that.

687
00:58:22,677 --> 00:58:23,755
Thank you.

688
00:59:07,910 --> 00:59:08,925
Okay, he's coming.

689
00:59:11,799 --> 00:59:14,304
- We gonna search him when he gets here
- Sure.

690
00:59:51,911 --> 00:59:53,160
Okay, let's go.

691
01:00:10,539 --> 01:00:13,823
- Is he supposed to limp like that?
- Get your hand out of your pocket.

692
01:00:14,974 --> 01:00:17,163
- Hey.
- "Allah hu Akbar. " (God is Great)

693
01:00:17,198 --> 01:00:18,910
- Hey!
- Get your hand out of your pocket

694
01:00:18,945 --> 01:00:20,885
- Do it now!
- "Allah hu Akbar."

695
01:00:20,920 --> 01:00:22,431
- Get your hand out of your poc...
- "Allah hu Akb..."

696
01:00:42,077 --> 01:00:44,645
<i>The CIA says, seven of
it's employees were killed,</i>

697
01:00:44,680 --> 01:00:48,831
<i>and six others wounded, in a suicide
bombing in a base in Afghanistan.</i>

698
01:00:48,866 --> 01:00:51,846
<i>It was one of the deadliest
attacks in CIA history.</i>

699
01:00:51,879 --> 01:00:53,284
<i>The Associated Press has learned that...</i>

700
01:00:53,319 --> 01:00:56,773
<i>the chief of the CIA's post in
the province, is among the victims.</i>

701
01:00:56,808 --> 01:00:59,575
<i>Former officials say, she
was the mother of three.</i>

702
01:00:59,610 --> 01:01:02,156
<i>The Taliban claimed
resposibility for the bombing...</i>

703
01:01:52,771 --> 01:01:54,748
- You okay?
- Mhm.

704
01:01:55,979 --> 01:01:59,910
I, um, didn't think this
day could get any worse,

705
01:02:01,235 --> 01:02:02,479
But, uh...

706
01:02:03,255 --> 01:02:06,666
bad news from Saudi
intelligence. The, um...

707
01:02:07,179 --> 01:02:10,324
courier guy, Abu Ahmed, is dead.

708
01:02:11,412 --> 01:02:13,180
It's a detainee video.

709
01:02:36,913 --> 01:02:37,636
<i>He's dead.</i>

710
01:02:39,020 --> 01:02:43,159
<i>In Afghanistan, 2001, I
buried him with my own hands.</i>

711
01:02:45,213 --> 01:02:48,680
<i>He's dead. In Afghanistan, 2001...</i>

712
01:02:49,513 --> 01:02:50,641
<i>And where was this?</i>

713
01:02:51,978 --> 01:02:52,804
<i>Kabul.</i>

714
01:02:52,957 --> 01:02:55,690
No, I don't believe this.
I don't believe this.

715
01:02:57,248 --> 01:02:58,296
Sorry, Maya.

716
01:02:59,612 --> 01:03:01,179
I always liked this lead.

717
01:03:26,536 --> 01:03:27,845
Sorry I just got here.

718
01:03:38,679 --> 01:03:39,684
What are you going to do?

719
01:03:47,391 --> 01:03:50,365
I'm gonna smoke everybody
involved in this op.

720
01:03:52,086 --> 01:03:53,941
And then I'm gonna kill bin Laden.

721
01:04:03,929 --> 01:04:04,863
Right.

722
01:04:07,305 --> 01:04:08,031
Right.

723
01:04:31,355 --> 01:04:33,407
I wanna make something absolutely clear.

724
01:04:34,871 --> 01:04:36,486
If you thought there was some...

725
01:04:37,588 --> 01:04:40,789
secret cell somewhere, working al-Qaeda,

726
01:04:41,769 --> 01:04:43,512
well, I want you to
know that you're wrong.

727
01:04:45,800 --> 01:04:46,611
This is it.

728
01:04:48,677 --> 01:04:51,093
There's no working group
coming to the rescue.

729
01:04:52,787 --> 01:04:55,775
There's nobody else hidden
away on some other floor.

730
01:04:56,935 --> 01:04:58,118
There is just us.

731
01:05:00,157 --> 01:05:01,785
And we are failing!

732
01:05:05,256 --> 01:05:07,349
We're spending billions of dollars.

733
01:05:08,099 --> 01:05:09,384
People are dying!

734
01:05:10,799 --> 01:05:14,055
We are still no closer
to defeating our enemy.

735
01:05:16,437 --> 01:05:17,966
They attacked us!

736
01:05:18,758 --> 01:05:21,177
On land, in '98,

737
01:05:21,280 --> 01:05:25,757
by sea in 2000, and from the air in 2001

738
01:05:27,671 --> 01:05:32,702
They murdered 3,000 of our
citizens, in cold blood.

739
01:05:34,248 --> 01:05:36,743
And they have slaughtered
our forward-deployed!

740
01:05:37,175 --> 01:05:39,809
And what the fuck have
we done about it, huh?

741
01:05:42,681 --> 01:05:43,814
What have we done?

742
01:05:46,293 --> 01:05:50,762
We have twenty leadership names.
We've only eliminated four of them.

743
01:05:53,766 --> 01:05:54,772
I want...

744
01:05:55,597 --> 01:05:56,448
targets.

745
01:05:57,694 --> 01:06:00,981
Do your fuckin' jobs,
bring me people to kill.

746
01:06:27,039 --> 01:06:30,649
Hi, I painstakingly combed through
everything in the system and found this.

747
01:06:32,903 --> 01:06:33,658
It's him.

748
01:06:34,516 --> 01:06:38,589
He was one of ten names on a watch list
sent to us by the Moroccans after 9/11.

749
01:06:39,041 --> 01:06:40,409
Ibrahim Sayeed.

750
01:06:40,546 --> 01:06:42,621
They told us to watch
out for him. Apparently,

751
01:06:42,656 --> 01:06:46,897
they think his whole family and extended
family is bad, and has ties to KSM.

752
01:06:47,491 --> 01:06:51,237
He was picked up for fake papers and a
doctored exit visa leaving Afghanistan,

753
01:06:51,272 --> 01:06:55,929
traveling through Morocco, en route
to Kuwait. Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti.

754
01:06:56,364 --> 01:06:58,455
This must be Abu Ahmed.

755
01:07:04,542 --> 01:07:07,419
Doesn't matter. God, I wish
I had that five years ago.

756
01:07:08,836 --> 01:07:11,974
- How come I never saw it before?
- Nobody saw it, most likely.

757
01:07:12,691 --> 01:07:14,761
There was a lot of
white noise after 9/11.

758
01:07:14,927 --> 01:07:18,255
Countries wanting to help out.
We got a million tips, and...

759
01:07:19,088 --> 01:07:21,500
you know, things got lost in the shuffle

760
01:07:22,790 --> 01:07:24,044
Human error.

761
01:07:26,012 --> 01:07:28,062
Anyway, I thought you
should know about it.

762
01:07:35,407 --> 01:07:38,190
I just wanna say, I've
heard a lot about you.

763
01:07:38,992 --> 01:07:40,837
You've inspired me to come to Pakistan.

764
01:07:41,682 --> 01:07:44,117
Maybe you'd let me buy
you a kebab sometime.

765
01:07:44,457 --> 01:07:45,567
Don't eat out.

766
01:07:47,343 --> 01:07:48,608
It's too dangerous.

767
01:08:06,266 --> 01:08:09,518
- Yup.
- Dan, Debbie found Abu Ahmed.

768
01:08:11,098 --> 01:08:12,167
Really?

769
01:08:12,404 --> 01:08:13,748
<i>Yeah, he's been in the files this...</i>

770
01:08:13,783 --> 01:08:16,037
whole time. The family's name is Sayeed.

771
01:08:16,545 --> 01:08:17,693
Okay, but he's, uh...

772
01:08:17,728 --> 01:08:20,700
he's dead, so doesn't that make him
a little less interesting to you?

773
01:08:20,735 --> 01:08:24,492
<i>He may not be. We now know Abu
Ahmed is one of eight brothers.</i>

774
01:08:24,603 --> 01:08:28,000
All the brothers in the family look
alike. Three of them went to Afghanistan

775
01:08:28,035 --> 01:08:29,346
<i>Isn't it possible that when...</i>

776
01:08:29,381 --> 01:08:33,629
<i>the three eldest brothers grew beards in
Afghanistan, they started to look alike?</i>

777
01:08:33,664 --> 01:08:36,494
I think the one calling himself
Abu Ahmed is still alive.

778
01:08:36,529 --> 01:08:39,226
The picture we've been using is wrong.

779
01:08:39,261 --> 01:08:43,742
It's of his older brother,
Habib. He's the one that's dead.

780
01:08:43,977 --> 01:08:45,565
Okay, and what are you basing this on?

781
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:48,373
<i>We have no intercepts
about Abu Ahmed dying.</i>

782
01:08:48,552 --> 01:08:52,183
We just have a detainee, who said he
buried a guy, who looked like Abu Ahmed.

783
01:08:52,218 --> 01:08:54,765
But if someone as important
as Abu Ahmed had died,

784
01:08:55,006 --> 01:08:56,257
they'd be talking about it online,

785
01:08:56,292 --> 01:08:57,944
<i>in chatrooms all over the place.</i>

786
01:08:58,076 --> 01:09:01,464
<i>Plus, the detainee said
that Habib died in 2001.</i>

787
01:09:01,499 --> 01:09:05,396
We know Abu Ahmed was alive then,
trying to get into Tora Bora with Ammar.

788
01:09:05,431 --> 01:09:08,341
That means it's probably
one of the other brothers...

789
01:09:08,386 --> 01:09:09,616
<i>that's dead.</i>

790
01:09:12,809 --> 01:09:16,237
- In other words, you want it to be true
- Yes, I fucking want it to be true!

791
01:09:16,272 --> 01:09:18,210
<i>Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, calm down.</i>

792
01:09:18,245 --> 01:09:20,524
- Calm down.
- I am calm.

793
01:09:22,176 --> 01:09:23,349
State your request.

794
01:09:25,354 --> 01:09:26,588
Move heaven and earth.

795
01:09:27,821 --> 01:09:31,254
And bring me this fucking
Sayeed family's phone number.

796
01:09:35,469 --> 01:09:37,247
<i>Okay, I'll go and talk to the Wolf.</i>

797
01:09:58,483 --> 01:10:00,717
- As-salam alaykum. (Peace be unto you)
- Wa-alaykum salam. (And unto you peace)

798
01:10:08,265 --> 01:10:10,293
I need a couple of
hundred thousand bucks.

799
01:10:11,774 --> 01:10:12,946
Four max.

800
01:10:15,975 --> 01:10:18,986
- Where're you gonna get that?
- From you.

801
01:10:19,269 --> 01:10:20,844
- You think so?
- Yeah.

802
01:10:21,036 --> 01:10:21,959
This could crack open...

803
01:10:21,994 --> 01:10:24,893
the facilitator Maya's been looking
for, by giving us a phone number.

804
01:10:26,682 --> 01:10:28,636
She's your killer, Wolf,
you put her on the field.

805
01:10:30,406 --> 01:10:31,107
Come on.

806
01:10:31,142 --> 01:10:33,544
"Bismillah ar-Rahman ar-Raheem" (In the
name of God, most Gracious, most Merciful)

807
01:10:33,835 --> 01:10:38,298
Allah rewards those that strive and
fight, over those that sit behind a desk

808
01:10:42,269 --> 01:10:46,430
As you know, Abu Ghraib
and Gitmo fucked us.

809
01:10:47,352 --> 01:10:51,676
The Detainee Program is now flypaper.
We got Senators jumping out of our asses

810
01:10:52,324 --> 01:10:54,519
And the director is very concerned.

811
01:10:55,813 --> 01:10:58,453
They will not stop
until they have a body.

812
01:11:01,008 --> 01:11:01,991
I ran it.

813
01:11:04,181 --> 01:11:05,226
I'll defend it.

814
01:11:09,647 --> 01:11:10,444
Done.

815
01:11:32,280 --> 01:11:34,583
I tell you what, man, it's
good to be back in Kuwait.

816
01:11:35,429 --> 01:11:38,753
It's good to see you again.
Huh? It's been a while.

817
01:11:44,501 --> 01:11:45,691
I need a favor.

818
01:11:48,455 --> 01:11:49,773
Why I should help you?

819
01:11:50,494 --> 01:11:51,643
Because we're friends.

820
01:11:52,220 --> 01:11:53,485
You say we are friend.

821
01:11:54,150 --> 01:11:56,629
How come you only call
me when you need help?

822
01:11:57,131 --> 01:12:00,320
But when I need something, you
are too busy to pick up the phone.

823
01:12:00,934 --> 01:12:04,149
- I don't think we are friends.
- All right, fair enough.

824
01:12:06,170 --> 01:12:09,422
How about a V10 Lamborghini?
How's that for friendship?

825
01:12:11,355 --> 01:12:12,790
Poor fucker had to get out of bed.

826
01:12:16,825 --> 01:12:17,549
Hey.

827
01:12:21,351 --> 01:12:22,848
- As-salam alaykum.
- Wa-alaykum salam.

828
01:12:22,883 --> 01:12:24,003
- Thank you very much for this.
- You're welcome.

829
01:12:24,038 --> 01:12:24,857
Appreciate it.

830
01:12:27,799 --> 01:12:28,740
All right.

831
01:12:30,333 --> 01:12:32,194
- Ooh, is this a Balboni?
- Yeah.

832
01:12:34,765 --> 01:12:35,758
Fuck me dead.

833
01:12:36,747 --> 01:12:39,606
It's nice, really nice.
What are you thinking?

834
01:12:40,300 --> 01:12:43,791
Huh? Maybe a convertible? Get a
little bit of wind in the hair?

835
01:12:44,906 --> 01:12:46,339
huh? Put the top down?

836
01:12:49,905 --> 01:12:51,638
I think I will choose this one.

837
01:12:52,262 --> 01:12:54,004
Give us a minute? Thank you.

838
01:12:55,189 --> 01:12:58,863
That's a nice choice, my friend.
Speed yellow, go big or go home, huh?

839
01:12:59,499 --> 01:13:00,715
Nice choice.

840
01:13:07,916 --> 01:13:08,761
Sayeed.

841
01:13:11,300 --> 01:13:12,801
- Who is it?
- Who do you think?

842
01:13:13,685 --> 01:13:14,754
Guy's a terrorist.

843
01:13:15,480 --> 01:13:16,536
His mother lives here.

844
01:13:17,944 --> 01:13:19,653
I just need her phone number.

845
01:13:21,452 --> 01:13:23,869
There will be no repercussions in Kuwait

846
01:13:26,020 --> 01:13:28,386
I mean, somebody might die,
at some point, in Pakistan.

847
01:13:31,664 --> 01:13:32,757
We got a deal?

848
01:14:18,661 --> 01:14:19,418
Hey, Jack.

849
01:14:19,782 --> 01:14:22,357
Sayeed family call in progress,
but you're not gonna like this.

850
01:14:22,592 --> 01:14:24,580
<i>The ground branch guys
are dragging their heels,</i>

851
01:14:24,615 --> 01:14:26,385
<i>there's no team deployed right now.</i>

852
01:14:26,420 --> 01:14:27,123
Fuck.

853
01:14:27,158 --> 01:14:28,574
<i>He hasn't said anything incriminating,</i>

854
01:14:28,609 --> 01:14:30,880
<i>but he's at the Rawal
call center in Rawalpindi.</i>

855
01:14:33,052 --> 01:14:33,810
Hey!

856
01:14:35,120 --> 01:14:37,471
Why haven't you deployed a
team to stay in Rawalpindi?

857
01:14:40,338 --> 01:14:41,725
For one thing, it's dangerous.

858
01:14:43,286 --> 01:14:46,012
For another, the area is too
congested for us to be effective,

859
01:14:46,047 --> 01:14:48,580
- without some predictive intelligence.
- Yeah, but that's why...

860
01:14:48,615 --> 01:14:51,083
you should forward deploy, so
you can shorten the response time.

861
01:14:51,118 --> 01:14:52,887
- It still wouldn't work.
- Why?

862
01:14:56,034 --> 01:14:57,877
The guy never stays on
the phone long enough.

863
01:14:57,912 --> 01:15:01,060
- You haven't tried.
- Look, I don't have the personnel.

864
01:15:01,095 --> 01:15:02,830
- That's bullshit, man.
- Yeah?

865
01:15:03,142 --> 01:15:06,553
As it is, my guys don't get any sleep,
tracking the threats within Pakistan.

866
01:15:07,347 --> 01:15:08,348
Right, I understand.

867
01:15:08,383 --> 01:15:11,161
But, you know, I don't really
care if your guys get sleep or not.

868
01:15:33,207 --> 01:15:34,845
This guy you are obsessed with.

869
01:15:36,150 --> 01:15:36,967
What's his name again?

870
01:15:37,335 --> 01:15:39,780
Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti
is the nom de guerre.

871
01:15:40,700 --> 01:15:42,921
His true name, we
think, is Ibrahim Sayeed.

872
01:15:44,081 --> 01:15:46,708
Family lives in Kuwait. We've
been listening in on their calls.

873
01:15:47,566 --> 01:15:48,270
Wasn't it,

874
01:15:49,460 --> 01:15:53,694
like, eight brothers and a
million cousins that we know about?

875
01:15:54,814 --> 01:15:57,035
- Anyone could be calling home.
- I know.

876
01:15:57,070 --> 01:15:59,689
I mean, it's not like he's saying,
"Hey, Mom, it's me, the terrorist."

877
01:16:01,027 --> 01:16:05,212
Yeah, I know. But, look,
over the course of two months,

878
01:16:05,576 --> 01:16:07,312
He's called from six different payphones

879
01:16:07,347 --> 01:16:10,587
from two different cities,
never using the same phone twice.

880
01:16:10,642 --> 01:16:13,154
And when his mother asked
him where he was, he lied.

881
01:16:13,464 --> 01:16:16,275
He said that he was in a place in
the country with bad cell reception,

882
01:16:16,310 --> 01:16:20,296
implying he was in the Tribals. When,
in fact, he was in a market in Peshawar.

883
01:16:20,650 --> 01:16:23,432
I'm sorry but that's not normal
guy behavior, that's tradecraft.

884
01:16:25,670 --> 01:16:28,421
Or maybe he just doesn't like his Mum.

885
01:16:32,890 --> 01:16:35,677
Look, if he talks about an operation or

886
01:16:36,461 --> 01:16:39,885
refers to anything remotely
fishy, I'll get on him, okay?

887
01:16:39,920 --> 01:16:41,506
No, no, not okay, look.

888
01:16:42,390 --> 01:16:46,777
Abu Ahmed is too smart to tip his
hand, by talking about ops on the phone.

889
01:16:47,437 --> 01:16:49,049
He works for bin Laden.

890
01:16:49,441 --> 01:16:52,247
The guys that talk about ops
on the phone don't get that job.

891
01:16:57,021 --> 01:16:59,575
A lot of my friends have
died, trying to do this.

892
01:17:03,926 --> 01:17:06,647
I believe I was spared,
so I could finish the job.

893
01:18:10,068 --> 01:18:14,722
<i>It is in surveillance video and pictures
like this of the explosive-laden vehicle</i>

894
01:18:14,757 --> 01:18:18,535
<i>just moments before it was parked,
that police hope to find the man,</i>

895
01:18:18,570 --> 01:18:23,204
<i>who wanted so badly last night, to
leave a body count in Times Square.</i>

896
01:18:23,239 --> 01:18:27,005
<i>There are some people around the world,
that find our freedom so threatening,</i>

897
01:18:27,040 --> 01:18:29,567
<i>that they're willing to
kill themselves and others,</i>

898
01:18:29,602 --> 01:18:32,164
<i>to prevent us from enjoying it, but
we're not gonna let that happen...</i>

899
01:18:32,199 --> 01:18:33,410
Hey, I really need to talk to you...

900
01:18:33,445 --> 01:18:35,603
about beefing up our surveillance
operation on the caller.

901
01:18:35,648 --> 01:18:38,440
We don't have a surveillance
operation on the caller.

902
01:18:38,943 --> 01:18:41,866
Someone just tried to blow up Times
Square and you're talking to me about...

903
01:18:41,901 --> 01:18:44,559
some facilitator, who some
detainee, seven years ago, said,

904
01:18:44,594 --> 01:18:47,677
- might have been working with al-Qaeda?
- He's the key to bin Laden.

905
01:18:50,299 --> 01:18:54,244
I don't fucking care about bin
Laden, I care about the next attack.

906
01:18:54,775 --> 01:18:57,620
You're gonna start working on
the American al-Qaeda cells.

907
01:18:57,655 --> 01:18:58,656
Protect the homeland.

908
01:18:58,766 --> 01:19:01,961
Bin Laden is the one who keeps
telling them to attack the homeland.

909
01:19:02,862 --> 01:19:06,485
If it wasn't for him, al-Qaeda would
still be focused on overseas targets.

910
01:19:06,520 --> 01:19:10,366
If you really wanna protect the
homeland, you need to get bin Laden.

911
01:19:10,401 --> 01:19:12,315
This guy never met bin Laden.

912
01:19:13,513 --> 01:19:16,227
This guy's a freelancer working
off the fucking internet.

913
01:19:16,591 --> 01:19:19,991
No one's even talked to bin Laden
in four years. He's out of the game.

914
01:19:20,026 --> 01:19:22,628
He may well even be dead. He
might as well be fucking dead.

915
01:19:22,663 --> 01:19:24,085
But you know what you're doing?

916
01:19:24,390 --> 01:19:27,564
You're chasing a ghost while the whole
fucking network grows all around you.

917
01:19:27,599 --> 01:19:30,311
You just want me to nail some
low-level molar-cracker-doler,

918
01:19:30,346 --> 01:19:32,327
so you can check that box
on your resume that says,

919
01:19:32,362 --> 01:19:35,422
while you were in Pakistan,
you got a real terrorist.

920
01:19:35,457 --> 01:19:40,805
But the truth is, you don't understand
Pakistan, and you don't know al-Qaeda!

921
01:19:40,840 --> 01:19:43,940
Either give me the team I
need, to follow this lead,

922
01:19:43,975 --> 01:19:45,737
or that other thing you're
gonna have on your resume,

923
01:19:45,772 --> 01:19:49,221
is being the first station chief to be
called before Congressional Committee,

924
01:19:49,256 --> 01:19:53,596
for subverting the efforts
to capture or kill bin Laden!

925
01:19:57,847 --> 01:19:59,726
You're fucking out of your mind.

926
01:20:01,823 --> 01:20:04,585
I need four techs and a
safe house in Rawalpindi.

927
01:20:05,633 --> 01:20:07,451
Four techs and a safe house in Peshawar.

928
01:20:08,393 --> 01:20:09,217
Either send them out,

929
01:20:09,252 --> 01:20:12,806
or send me back to DC, and explain
to the director why you didn't.

930
01:20:32,735 --> 01:20:33,797
I've been looking for you.

931
01:20:34,306 --> 01:20:35,273
But more importantly,

932
01:20:35,964 --> 01:20:37,080
he's been looking for you.

933
01:20:38,282 --> 01:20:40,502
Yesterday, your caller
bought himself a cell phone.

934
01:20:41,803 --> 01:20:43,718
And every time his phone rings,

935
01:20:44,440 --> 01:20:45,941
this phone will ring.

936
01:20:48,462 --> 01:20:50,224
Did I hook you up? Did I?

937
01:21:02,490 --> 01:21:05,546
My guess is that he lives close
to where he's making the calls.

938
01:21:05,672 --> 01:21:08,236
And it makes sense he'd
be living in Rawalpindi,

939
01:21:08,616 --> 01:21:10,705
because there's an Al
Jazeera office there.

940
01:21:11,589 --> 01:21:13,604
It'd be convenient for
him to drop the tapes off,

941
01:21:13,639 --> 01:21:17,600
if he's messengering, either from
Bin Laden, or to an intermediary.

942
01:21:17,839 --> 01:21:19,907
So, when he wants to make a call,

943
01:21:20,231 --> 01:21:24,002
he leaves the house, walks a few
blocks, then switches on the phone.

944
01:21:24,420 --> 01:21:26,751
We need to keep canvassing the
neighborhood until we find him.

945
01:21:42,515 --> 01:21:43,512
We got a shooter.

946
01:21:50,049 --> 01:21:50,975
We're blocked.

947
01:21:57,035 --> 01:21:58,073
Let me talk to them.

948
01:22:34,687 --> 01:22:36,558
They said whites faces don't belong here

949
01:22:38,155 --> 01:22:39,898
If they don't move, shoot them.

950
01:23:10,504 --> 01:23:11,438
He's still on?

951
01:23:13,548 --> 01:23:15,725
- He's east of us, try the market.
- Okay, heading east.

952
01:23:26,999 --> 01:23:27,758
Fuck.

953
01:24:03,634 --> 01:24:07,161
We got a signal on Tipu
Road for ten minutes.

954
01:24:08,013 --> 01:24:10,593
Then he went to Umar Road for 5 minutes,

955
01:24:10,628 --> 01:24:15,244
NoGaza Road, Darya Abad,
that's in the Umar Road area.

956
01:24:15,558 --> 01:24:16,750
In Rawalpindi,

957
01:24:17,426 --> 01:24:18,486
Haider Road.

958
01:24:18,907 --> 01:24:20,276
Roomi Road.

959
01:24:21,276 --> 01:24:24,071
He went to the Convoy Road, which
is near the hospital, all right?

960
01:24:24,583 --> 01:24:30,555
So that's Haider, Roomi
Road, Zahid, NoGaza, Taimur.

961
01:24:31,016 --> 01:24:34,568
He made a call from Hapur
Street. That's the Spice District.

962
01:24:35,139 --> 01:24:38,108
Lahore Street, which is also in Pesh
- 30 minutes.

963
01:24:39,018 --> 01:24:41,507
Wazir Bagh Road - 5.

964
01:24:42,258 --> 01:24:44,610
Nishtarabad - 5.

965
01:24:46,933 --> 01:24:49,152
Phandu Road - 5 minutes.

966
01:24:53,443 --> 01:24:56,024
The Grand Trunk Road - 45 seconds.

967
01:24:57,110 --> 01:24:58,353
There's no pattern.

968
01:24:59,201 --> 01:25:01,325
Sometimes, he calls every two
weeks, sometimes, every three.

969
01:25:01,360 --> 01:25:02,486
There's no consistency.

970
01:25:02,607 --> 01:25:05,341
I can't predict when he's gonna make
another call, 'cause the guy's erratic.

971
01:26:08,375 --> 01:26:11,817
<i>Meanwhile, our chief foreign
correspondent, Richard Engel confirms...</i>

972
01:26:11,852 --> 01:26:16,266
<i>the CIA's top spy in Pakistan
has been pulled out of there.</i>

973
01:26:16,301 --> 01:26:20,012
<i>He's been receiving death threats,
after being named publicly in a lawsuit,</i>

974
01:26:20,047 --> 01:26:23,868
<i>by the family of a victim
of a US drone attack.</i>

975
01:26:23,903 --> 01:26:27,011
<i>Richard Engel quotes a senior
intelligence official as saying,</i>

976
01:26:27,046 --> 01:26:31,013
<i>the officer is returning to the US,
after the decision was made that...</i>

977
01:26:31,048 --> 01:26:35,530
<i>terrorist threats against him, in
Pakistan, were of such a serious nature,</i>

978
01:26:35,565 --> 01:26:38,094
<i>it would not be smart not to act.</i>

979
01:26:40,894 --> 01:26:42,495
ISI fucked you.

980
01:26:46,694 --> 01:26:48,395
I'm so sorry, Joseph.

981
01:27:18,881 --> 01:27:19,927
Still on tower three.

982
01:27:20,795 --> 01:27:21,544
5...

983
01:27:22,464 --> 01:27:24,334
Signal getting stronger, 10...

984
01:27:25,057 --> 01:27:26,287
15... Keep going.

985
01:27:26,683 --> 01:27:29,313
20... 15... 10...

986
01:27:29,918 --> 01:27:31,262
Signal's getting weaker.

987
01:27:36,048 --> 01:27:38,198
We lost him, no signal.

988
01:27:40,784 --> 01:27:42,048
Heading south.

989
01:27:50,507 --> 01:27:51,613
He's up at 5 again.

990
01:27:52,279 --> 01:27:53,615
15... 20...

991
01:27:54,545 --> 01:27:56,654
He's moving fast, he's in a vehicle.

992
01:27:57,301 --> 01:27:58,756
Weaker now, he shifted. Go back to 5.

993
01:28:01,583 --> 01:28:03,085
He's close by here, somewhere.

994
01:28:04,010 --> 01:28:05,050
I don't get it.

995
01:28:07,475 --> 01:28:09,104
He's driving in circles.

996
01:28:19,905 --> 01:28:21,119
- No change?
- No.

997
01:28:30,881 --> 01:28:33,013
Now let's hope he comes back around.

998
01:29:05,082 --> 01:29:06,527
Okay, 15...

999
01:29:08,182 --> 01:29:08,930
20...

1000
01:29:09,587 --> 01:29:10,309
30...

1001
01:29:11,603 --> 01:29:12,360
40...

1002
01:29:13,237 --> 01:29:14,010
50...

1003
01:29:15,005 --> 01:29:16,229
We're within ten meters of it.

1004
01:29:24,366 --> 01:29:25,220
Back to 40.

1005
01:29:26,843 --> 01:29:28,508
- He's here somewhere.
- Look at the cars.

1006
01:29:28,932 --> 01:29:30,370
Look at the cars, he's in a vehicle.

1007
01:29:37,024 --> 01:29:38,478
The guy with the phone in the white car.

1008
01:29:39,759 --> 01:29:40,610
You see him?

1009
01:29:42,488 --> 01:29:44,120
- Is that him?
- Could be.

1010
01:29:44,819 --> 01:29:46,040
- You got him?
- Got him.

1011
01:29:46,196 --> 01:29:47,145
Okay, breaking off.

1012
01:29:50,624 --> 01:29:52,142
The guy you've been looking for,

1013
01:29:52,412 --> 01:29:53,583
geolocated,

1014
01:29:53,855 --> 01:29:54,895
on his cell phone,

1015
01:29:55,469 --> 01:29:56,291
in his white car.

1016
01:29:58,168 --> 01:29:59,061
Thank you.

1017
01:30:01,932 --> 01:30:02,725
If you're right,

1018
01:30:03,957 --> 01:30:05,942
the whole world's gonna want in on this.

1019
01:30:06,951 --> 01:30:08,659
So, you gotta stick to your guns now.

1020
01:30:17,322 --> 01:30:21,260
Okay. No, it's great to speak to you too
I'm-I'm amazed that you're still here.

1021
01:30:22,964 --> 01:30:24,447
Well, I-I can do, um...

1022
01:30:25,062 --> 01:30:26,372
Let me have a look, um...

1023
01:30:26,780 --> 01:30:28,159
Why don't we say 1:30.

1024
01:30:31,357 --> 01:30:32,057
Yeah.

1025
01:30:32,951 --> 01:30:35,163
Uh, can you just hold the line, please?

1026
01:30:36,102 --> 01:30:38,941
I need a picket line along the GT
Highway, and men spaced at intervals...

1027
01:30:38,976 --> 01:30:41,760
- along the road, and at every exit.
- Maya, I know.

1028
01:30:41,963 --> 01:30:44,297
So, you agree with me
now, this is important.

1029
01:30:45,935 --> 01:30:49,008
No, I've just learned from my
predecessor, that life is better...

1030
01:30:49,043 --> 01:30:50,656
when I don't disagree with you.

1031
01:31:35,283 --> 01:31:38,193
Our current hypothesis is that he
lives somewhere along the highway,

1032
01:31:38,730 --> 01:31:41,501
in one of the towns, or a
medium-sized city called Abbottabad,

1033
01:31:41,536 --> 01:31:42,964
or up near Kashmir.

1034
01:31:44,971 --> 01:31:48,159
Kashmir is interesting because
it's a way station for the Tribals.

1035
01:31:49,690 --> 01:31:52,631
Abbottabad is interesting because we
know from detainee reporting that...

1036
01:31:52,666 --> 01:31:55,464
Abu Faraj stayed there, briefly, in 2003

1037
01:31:58,243 --> 01:32:00,595
The good news is he's
driving a white SUV.

1038
01:32:01,071 --> 01:32:03,365
SUVs are actually
pretty rare in Pakistan.

1039
01:32:04,381 --> 01:32:06,972
If he was driving a sedan
or a compact, we'd be fucked.

1040
01:32:08,071 --> 01:32:10,466
Obviously, this assumes
he doesn't change vehicles.

1041
01:32:24,076 --> 01:32:25,951
- Morning.
- Morning, Hamad.

1042
01:33:22,839 --> 01:33:23,591
"Yalla, yalla..."

1043
01:33:31,109 --> 01:33:35,942
Any American in Pakistan is a target.
They don't necessarily know I'm CIA.

1044
01:33:36,261 --> 01:33:37,107
Doesn't matter.

1045
01:33:37,987 --> 01:33:39,042
You're on a list.

1046
01:33:39,901 --> 01:33:40,601
Yeah.

1047
01:33:41,073 --> 01:33:44,120
And you, of all people, should
know that once you're on their list,

1048
01:33:45,624 --> 01:33:46,840
you never get off.

1049
01:33:48,191 --> 01:33:50,990
Next time, there may not be
bulletproof glass to save you.

1050
01:33:53,717 --> 01:33:55,878
We'll keep up on the
surveillance as best we can.

1051
01:35:32,555 --> 01:35:34,776
The high-res version, can
you get closer than that?

1052
01:35:34,811 --> 01:35:36,262
Yeah, well, you can up-res this image.

1053
01:35:36,958 --> 01:35:37,721
Even more?

1054
01:35:39,444 --> 01:35:40,677
Okay, that's good. Thank you.

1055
01:35:44,700 --> 01:35:45,899
I'll take that. Thank you very much.

1056
01:35:46,050 --> 01:35:47,879
- Take that too.
- You got it "ch".

1057
01:35:48,199 --> 01:35:50,666
...to clean that audio as
well, just take the low one out.

1058
01:36:05,715 --> 01:36:06,437
Hey.

1059
01:36:08,366 --> 01:36:10,966
All right, so tell me
how I'm doing so far.

1060
01:36:11,052 --> 01:36:13,993
Basically, we had a guy who rolled
with al-Qaeda, and did services for him.

1061
01:36:14,028 --> 01:36:15,703
- Mm-hm.
- We lost him for seven years.

1062
01:36:15,738 --> 01:36:19,284
Now we find him again, and... boy,
does he have a really nice house.

1063
01:36:19,319 --> 01:36:21,488
- Is that it?
- Pretty much.

1064
01:36:22,339 --> 01:36:24,590
All right, let's go talk to the boss.

1065
01:36:29,461 --> 01:36:31,689
Oh, you, uh, you should sit back there.

1066
01:36:32,662 --> 01:36:33,565
- Sorry.
- No.

1067
01:36:39,573 --> 01:36:40,588
So they're gonna ask,

1068
01:36:41,550 --> 01:36:43,570
if bin Laden is at the
end of this rainbow.

1069
01:36:44,793 --> 01:36:46,343
Is the Pak military with him?

1070
01:36:46,983 --> 01:36:49,375
The question isn't: Are the
Paks protecting bin Laden?

1071
01:36:49,622 --> 01:36:52,354
The question is: Would he allow
himself to be protected by the Paks?

1072
01:36:52,824 --> 01:36:55,332
I mean, why would he trust
them? He tried to kill Musharraf.

1073
01:37:04,587 --> 01:37:05,788
- Hello.
- Sir.

1074
01:37:07,842 --> 01:37:08,839
All right, go ahead.

1075
01:37:09,638 --> 01:37:12,885
So a little context here, if you
take a right, out of Islamabad,

1076
01:37:12,927 --> 01:37:16,653
drive about forty-five minutes north,
you'll find yourself here in Abbottabad.

1077
01:37:16,953 --> 01:37:20,284
Now it's a mostly middle-class
community, some ex-military.

1078
01:37:20,319 --> 01:37:22,129
Not particularly interesting to us.

1079
01:37:22,472 --> 01:37:25,380
Except we did find this
compound, which is unique.

1080
01:37:26,406 --> 01:37:29,365
We got a 16-foot wall
around the entire perimeter.

1081
01:37:29,400 --> 01:37:30,877
The windows are blacked out.

1082
01:37:31,085 --> 01:37:33,619
There's even a 7-foot
privacy wall here, so,

1083
01:37:33,950 --> 01:37:36,400
even if we got up high, we
couldn't get a vantage point.

1084
01:37:36,435 --> 01:37:37,193
I mean it's-

1085
01:37:37,530 --> 01:37:38,844
it's a fortress.

1086
01:37:39,484 --> 01:37:41,201
Well, can't you put a camera somewhere?

1087
01:37:42,067 --> 01:37:44,737
In these trees here, maybe?
Get a look in the main house?

1088
01:37:45,046 --> 01:37:46,485
it would probably be discovered.

1089
01:37:49,406 --> 01:37:51,624
Well, we have to get a look
into the house, don't we?

1090
01:37:57,236 --> 01:37:58,052
All right.

1091
01:37:59,015 --> 01:38:01,336
What's this? This cluster
of buildings down here?

1092
01:38:01,394 --> 01:38:04,118
The PMA. It's the
Pakistani Military Academy.

1093
01:38:06,874 --> 01:38:08,293
It's their West Point.

1094
01:38:14,624 --> 01:38:16,190
And how close is that to the house?

1095
01:38:17,432 --> 01:38:18,315
About a mile.

1096
01:38:18,788 --> 01:38:21,894
4,221 feet. It's closer
to eight-tenths of a mile.

1097
01:38:23,178 --> 01:38:24,159
But who are you?

1098
01:38:24,437 --> 01:38:26,879
I'm the motherfucker that
found this place, sir.

1099
01:38:29,307 --> 01:38:30,236
Really?

1100
01:38:35,280 --> 01:38:38,262
All right, I wanna know more about who's
inside this house by the end of the week

1101
01:38:40,855 --> 01:38:41,818
Sir.

1102
01:38:51,291 --> 01:38:52,391
Motherfucker.

1103
01:38:54,807 --> 01:38:55,516
Good.

1104
01:39:13,735 --> 01:39:14,808
Morning, George.

1105
01:39:16,850 --> 01:39:18,059
21 days.

1106
01:39:18,933 --> 01:39:21,768
It's been 21 days since we found
the house, nothing's happened.

1107
01:39:57,779 --> 01:39:58,479
Yeah.

1108
01:39:58,514 --> 01:39:59,543
<i>Maya, it's Steve.</i>

1109
01:40:00,069 --> 01:40:02,941
- Swing by, I wanna show you something.
- Okay.

1110
01:40:04,039 --> 01:40:06,260
Okay, you can leave it paused for now,
but we're gonna play through that...

1111
01:40:06,295 --> 01:40:06,995
Hey!

1112
01:40:07,560 --> 01:40:09,510
- Maya, come see.
- Yeah.

1113
01:40:11,770 --> 01:40:13,485
Okay, this is from a
few minutes ago, okay?

1114
01:40:13,540 --> 01:40:14,240
Yeah.

1115
01:40:14,305 --> 01:40:17,629
So remember, we've got two
males, two females and seven kids.

1116
01:40:17,664 --> 01:40:18,364
What's that?

1117
01:40:18,399 --> 01:40:20,545
Okay, I'm saying that's
Bushra, the brother's wife.

1118
01:40:20,776 --> 01:40:22,234
Whoa, whoa, how do you know the gender?

1119
01:40:22,701 --> 01:40:24,635
Well, look, this is a clothesline
right here for laundry.

1120
01:40:24,670 --> 01:40:25,868
Men don't mess with the wash.

1121
01:40:26,235 --> 01:40:29,242
Okay, now watch, it takes her about
four seconds to move from there,

1122
01:40:29,277 --> 01:40:31,299
to the front door, so
she's on the older side.

1123
01:40:32,049 --> 01:40:34,635
- What's that up there?
- Uh, those are kids, they're...

1124
01:40:34,670 --> 01:40:37,333
shuffling around, sword fighting
or something, with sticks.

1125
01:40:37,368 --> 01:40:39,811
You can see their height
relative to this. These are cows.

1126
01:40:39,902 --> 01:40:41,986
So, they're probably between 7 and 9.

1127
01:40:42,021 --> 01:40:44,684
- Boys, definitely.
- Wow, your female's moving fast.

1128
01:40:44,719 --> 01:40:47,045
Okay, that's what I wanted to
show you. Can we pause this please?

1129
01:40:47,745 --> 01:40:48,915
That's not the same lady.

1130
01:40:49,502 --> 01:40:50,812
That's female number three.

1131
01:40:53,595 --> 01:40:57,284
- So you found two males, three females.
- That's correct.

1132
01:40:59,616 --> 01:41:02,391
So, if there are three females,
there ought to be three males.

1133
01:41:03,201 --> 01:41:07,156
Observant Muslim women live with
their parents, over their husbands.

1134
01:41:07,999 --> 01:41:10,884
We think there's a third
family, living in the house.

1135
01:41:11,795 --> 01:41:15,127
So, this third male that you've
identified as possibly being bin Laden,

1136
01:41:15,162 --> 01:41:17,407
do I give up all hope of ever
seeing a photograph of him?

1137
01:41:18,323 --> 01:41:20,317
Hope? Yeah.

1138
01:41:21,224 --> 01:41:23,234
You give up your hope, right now.

1139
01:41:23,940 --> 01:41:26,009
We scan for heat signatures,

1140
01:41:26,135 --> 01:41:29,202
but we can't validate if it's
a man or a woman up there.

1141
01:41:31,283 --> 01:41:33,951
We talked about burrowing a
pinhole camera, but there's a...

1142
01:41:33,986 --> 01:41:35,439
high risk of discovery.

1143
01:41:37,710 --> 01:41:39,012
We found a safe house,

1144
01:41:39,356 --> 01:41:43,284
but we can't get a vantage point to
fire a telescope over the balcony wall.

1145
01:41:43,319 --> 01:41:45,511
We have explored the possibility,

1146
01:41:45,546 --> 01:41:48,388
of digging tunnels, of
sending hot air balloons,

1147
01:41:48,423 --> 01:41:53,320
of rerouting supply C-130s to take a
peek, but that might be too alerting.

1148
01:41:53,837 --> 01:41:57,453
We've looked for ways of collecting
available DNA from his trash,

1149
01:41:57,488 --> 01:42:00,119
you know, looking for his
toothbrush, but they burn the trash.

1150
01:42:01,484 --> 01:42:03,573
We started a vaccination program,

1151
01:42:04,298 --> 01:42:06,761
sent a doctor to the house,
see if he could pull blood,

1152
01:42:10,897 --> 01:42:12,361
but that didn't work out.

1153
01:42:14,274 --> 01:42:16,041
We thought about sending
a guy with a bucket,

1154
01:42:16,150 --> 01:42:19,261
to pull a sample from the sewer,
to analyze his fecal matter.

1155
01:42:19,296 --> 01:42:20,902
What was wrong with that, exactly?

1156
01:42:21,898 --> 01:42:23,643
What was wrong with that? That, uh...

1157
01:42:25,344 --> 01:42:27,035
The sample would be too diluted.

1158
01:42:27,737 --> 01:42:31,369
And it's asking too much to get a voice
confirmation with him on the phone?

1159
01:42:31,917 --> 01:42:34,318
They don't make telephone
calls from the compound.

1160
01:42:34,353 --> 01:42:36,024
We pulled the cell tower nearby.

1161
01:42:36,326 --> 01:42:40,725
And I'm also going to give up hope that
he might ever get in that white SUV, and

1162
01:42:42,567 --> 01:42:45,652
drive around a bit and we could see him.

1163
01:42:46,356 --> 01:42:47,490
Don't they get groceries?

1164
01:42:48,032 --> 01:42:50,663
The unidentified third
male does not get groceries.

1165
01:42:51,036 --> 01:42:54,455
He does not leave the compound; he does
not present himself for photographs.

1166
01:42:54,490 --> 01:42:59,135
When he needs fresh air, he paces
around, beneath a grape arbor.

1167
01:42:59,702 --> 01:43:02,968
But the leaves are so thick,
they obscure our satellite views.

1168
01:43:03,002 --> 01:43:07,317
This is a professional
attempt to avoid detection.

1169
01:43:07,889 --> 01:43:09,884
Okay? Real tradecraft.

1170
01:43:10,948 --> 01:43:12,126
The only people we've seen...

1171
01:43:12,161 --> 01:43:15,462
behave in this way, are other
top-level al-Qaeda operatives.

1172
01:43:15,706 --> 01:43:17,711
We did a red team on your analysis.

1173
01:43:18,558 --> 01:43:22,603
According to them, this behavior could
belong to someone other than al-Qaeda.

1174
01:43:22,638 --> 01:43:26,220
They did give a 40 percent chance
that the unidentified third man...

1175
01:43:26,255 --> 01:43:28,060
is a senior al-Qaeda operative.

1176
01:43:28,468 --> 01:43:31,756
But they also said there's a 35
percent chance he's a Saudi drug dealer.

1177
01:43:32,069 --> 01:43:34,278
15 percent chance he's
a Kuwaiti arms smuggler.

1178
01:43:34,313 --> 01:43:36,851
10 percent chance he's one of
the relatives of the brothers.

1179
01:43:37,378 --> 01:43:39,764
Basically, we agree with you.
The house screams security.

1180
01:43:39,799 --> 01:43:43,131
It screams someone who wants
privacy; it even screams bad guy.

1181
01:43:43,166 --> 01:43:46,246
- But it does not scream bin Laden.
- You get the point?

1182
01:43:46,699 --> 01:43:49,693
If you can't prove it's bin Laden,
at least prove it's not someone else.

1183
01:43:50,740 --> 01:43:51,944
Like a drug dealer.

1184
01:43:57,081 --> 01:44:01,033
You know we lost the ability to prove
them when we lost the Detainee Program.

1185
01:44:01,312 --> 01:44:03,620
Who the hell am I supposed to ask? Huh?

1186
01:44:04,852 --> 01:44:06,669
Some guy in Gitmo who's all lawyered up?

1187
01:44:06,704 --> 01:44:09,199
He'll just tell his
lawyer to warn bin Laden.

1188
01:44:12,974 --> 01:44:14,341
You'll think of something.

1189
01:44:32,202 --> 01:44:36,221
He'd be the first successful drug
dealer never to have dealt drugs.

1190
01:44:36,812 --> 01:44:41,778
He has no internet access to the house;
he makes no phone calls either in or out

1191
01:44:41,813 --> 01:44:45,528
Who's he selling to? Who's he buying
from? How's he making his money?

1192
01:44:45,563 --> 01:44:48,537
And if you were to say, "He's retired,"
I'd say, "Where's the swimming pool?"

1193
01:44:49,633 --> 01:44:52,320
Where's the gold cage with the falcons?

1194
01:44:53,638 --> 01:44:55,107
And why does he send his courier...

1195
01:44:55,142 --> 01:44:59,150
to the two cities in Pakistan,
we most associate with al-Qaeda,

1196
01:44:59,185 --> 01:45:02,466
that have nothing particularly
to do with heroin production.

1197
01:45:03,122 --> 01:45:07,724
The president is a thoughtful,
analytical guy. He needs proof.

1198
01:45:19,771 --> 01:45:21,340
Go ahead, you guys.

1199
01:45:24,401 --> 01:45:26,067
I gotta say, your job...

1200
01:45:26,702 --> 01:45:27,663
- Hmm.
- Huh.

1201
01:45:28,881 --> 01:45:31,120
I just don't get the rhythms of politics

1202
01:45:31,655 --> 01:45:34,280
Oh, you think this is
political? If this was political,

1203
01:45:34,315 --> 01:45:37,438
we'd be having this conversation in
October, when there's an election bump.

1204
01:45:37,936 --> 01:45:43,749
This is pure risk, based on deductive
reasoning, inference, supposition,

1205
01:45:43,784 --> 01:45:47,427
and the only human reporting
you have is six years old,

1206
01:45:47,462 --> 01:45:49,975
from detainees, who were
questioned under duress.

1207
01:45:50,010 --> 01:45:52,724
The political move here is to
tell you to go fuck yourself,

1208
01:45:52,759 --> 01:45:58,357
and remind you, that I was in the room,
when your old boss pitched WMD Iraq.

1209
01:45:58,714 --> 01:46:00,601
At least, there, you
guys brought photographs.

1210
01:46:00,636 --> 01:46:03,428
You know, you're right, I agree
with everything you just said.

1211
01:46:04,883 --> 01:46:07,399
What I meant was, a man in your position

1212
01:46:08,762 --> 01:46:12,035
How do you evaluate the
risk of not doing something?

1213
01:46:13,172 --> 01:46:13,906
Hmm?

1214
01:46:14,513 --> 01:46:17,989
The risk of potentially letting
bin Laden slip through your fingers.

1215
01:46:19,673 --> 01:46:21,292
That is a fascinating question.

1216
01:46:25,614 --> 01:46:26,429
Hey.

1217
01:46:31,527 --> 01:46:33,232
I'm not saying we're gonna do it,

1218
01:46:34,350 --> 01:46:37,082
but the president wants to
know, if we were gonna act,

1219
01:46:37,844 --> 01:46:39,043
how would we do it?

1220
01:46:39,606 --> 01:46:40,929
Give us options.

1221
01:47:15,549 --> 01:47:17,311
Technically, these don't exist.

1222
01:47:17,570 --> 01:47:20,212
I actually tried to kill this
program a couple of times.

1223
01:47:21,442 --> 01:47:24,073
They've gone through, uh,
an initial round of testing,

1224
01:47:24,420 --> 01:47:27,162
and they have excellent radar defeat.

1225
01:47:27,411 --> 01:47:29,273
We just haven't tested
with people in them yet.

1226
01:47:30,310 --> 01:47:34,298
You'll notice these stealth panels,
similar to what we use on the B-2.

1227
01:47:34,634 --> 01:47:37,155
The rotors have been
muffled with decibel killers.

1228
01:47:37,190 --> 01:47:40,851
It's slower than a Black Hawk,
lacks the offense and the stability.

1229
01:47:41,270 --> 01:47:42,408
But, it can hide.

1230
01:47:42,603 --> 01:47:46,933
So, uh, e-excuse me, but what do we-what
do we need this for in-in Libya. I mean,

1231
01:47:46,968 --> 01:47:49,056
Gaddafi's anti-air is
virtually non-existent.

1232
01:47:50,847 --> 01:47:52,987
Maya, do you wanna brief them?

1233
01:48:01,315 --> 01:48:05,241
There are two narratives, about
the location of Osama bin Laden.

1234
01:48:05,546 --> 01:48:07,119
The one that you're most familiar with,

1235
01:48:07,154 --> 01:48:10,066
is that UBL is hiding in
a cave in the tribal areas.

1236
01:48:10,101 --> 01:48:13,101
That he's surrounded by a large
contingent of loyal fighters.

1237
01:48:14,031 --> 01:48:17,442
But that narrative, is
pre-9/11 understanding of UBL.

1238
01:48:17,967 --> 01:48:20,796
The second narrative, is
that he's living in a city.

1239
01:48:21,458 --> 01:48:24,851
Living in a city with multiple
points of egress and entry,

1240
01:48:25,314 --> 01:48:29,774
Access to communications, so that he
can keep in touch with the organization.

1241
01:48:31,109 --> 01:48:34,479
You can't run a global network of
interconnected cells from a cave.

1242
01:48:35,147 --> 01:48:38,917
We've located an individual, we
believe, based on detainee reporting,

1243
01:48:38,952 --> 01:48:40,541
is bin Laden's courier.

1244
01:48:41,236 --> 01:48:44,007
He's living in a house,
in Abbottabad, Pakistan.

1245
01:48:44,913 --> 01:48:46,356
And we assess,

1246
01:48:48,140 --> 01:48:50,959
that one of the other
occupants of the house,

1247
01:48:51,330 --> 01:48:52,691
is UBL.

1248
01:49:04,086 --> 01:49:05,005
General.

1249
01:49:13,130 --> 01:49:13,984
Excuse me.

1250
01:49:15,082 --> 01:49:18,562
Uh, so, UBL, you got-you got
an intel source on the ground?

1251
01:49:21,234 --> 01:49:23,263
- No.
- No?

1252
01:49:24,655 --> 01:49:26,718
Okay, so how do you know it's bin Laden?

1253
01:49:27,801 --> 01:49:29,468
'Cause the truth is, we've
been on this op before.

1254
01:49:29,503 --> 01:49:32,538
It was '07, and it wasn't bin
Laden, and we lost a couple of guys.

1255
01:49:33,002 --> 01:49:34,007
Totally understand.

1256
01:49:34,236 --> 01:49:36,851
Bin Laden uses a courier, to
interact with the outside world.

1257
01:49:36,886 --> 01:49:39,575
By locating the courier,
we've located bin Laden.

1258
01:49:39,655 --> 01:49:40,989
That's really the intel.

1259
01:49:42,030 --> 01:49:42,912
That's it?

1260
01:49:43,876 --> 01:49:45,849
Quite frankly, I didn't
even wanna use you guys.

1261
01:49:45,884 --> 01:49:47,958
With your dip and your velcro
and all your gear bullshit.

1262
01:49:47,993 --> 01:49:49,223
I wanted to drop a bomb.

1263
01:49:49,775 --> 01:49:52,397
But people didn't believe in
this lead enough to drop a bomb.

1264
01:49:52,872 --> 01:49:55,383
So, they're using you guys, as canaries,

1265
01:49:55,518 --> 01:49:58,795
in a theory that if bin Laden
isn't there, you can sneak away,

1266
01:49:58,830 --> 01:50:00,893
- and no one will be the wiser.
- Hmm.

1267
01:50:01,465 --> 01:50:03,676
But bin Laden, is there.

1268
01:50:05,877 --> 01:50:07,584
And you're gonna kill him for me.

1269
01:50:13,097 --> 01:50:13,941
They're nervous downtown.

1270
01:50:15,311 --> 01:50:17,759
I don't think we'll get an approval.
This decision is not going...

1271
01:50:31,921 --> 01:50:33,261
It's her against the world.

1272
01:50:34,228 --> 01:50:35,343
Oh, yeah.

1273
01:50:38,937 --> 01:50:41,317
I'm about to go look
the president in the eye.

1274
01:50:42,015 --> 01:50:44,834
And what I'd like to
know, no fucking bullshit,

1275
01:50:45,519 --> 01:50:47,393
is where everyone stands on this thing.

1276
01:50:48,479 --> 01:50:53,390
Now, very simply, is he there,
or is he not fucking there?

1277
01:50:54,969 --> 01:50:58,061
We all come at this, through the
filter of our own past experiences.

1278
01:50:58,241 --> 01:51:02,058
Now I remember Iraq WMD,
very clearly. I fronted that.

1279
01:51:02,093 --> 01:51:05,363
And I can tell you the case for that,
was much stronger than this case.

1280
01:51:05,398 --> 01:51:06,893
A fucking "yes" or a "no".

1281
01:51:07,304 --> 01:51:09,812
We don't deal in certainty,
we deal in probability.

1282
01:51:09,847 --> 01:51:13,685
And I'd say there's a 60
percent probability he's there.

1283
01:51:16,798 --> 01:51:18,978
I concur, 60 percent.

1284
01:51:20,560 --> 01:51:23,869
I'm at 80 percent, their
OPSEC is what convinces me.

1285
01:51:26,133 --> 01:51:29,349
- You guys ever agree on anything?
- Well, I agree with Mike.

1286
01:51:29,983 --> 01:51:32,026
We're basing this mostly
on detainee reporting,

1287
01:51:32,061 --> 01:51:36,798
and I spent a bunch of time in those
rooms. I'd say it's a soft 60, sir.

1288
01:51:37,388 --> 01:51:39,925
I'm virtually certain there's
some high value target there,

1289
01:51:39,960 --> 01:51:41,591
I'm just not sure it's bin Laden.

1290
01:51:43,877 --> 01:51:46,700
Well, this is a little bit
of a cluster fuck, isn't it?

1291
01:51:48,137 --> 01:51:49,656
I'd like to know what Maya thinks.

1292
01:51:49,691 --> 01:51:51,775
We're all incorporating
her assessment into ours.

1293
01:51:51,810 --> 01:51:53,476
A hundred percent he's there.

1294
01:51:56,154 --> 01:51:58,958
Okay, fine, 95 percent 'cause I
know certainty freaks you guys out,

1295
01:51:58,993 --> 01:52:00,575
but it's a hundred.

1296
01:52:15,231 --> 01:52:16,429
They're all cowed.

1297
01:52:20,256 --> 01:52:23,214
- What do you think of the girl?
- I think she's fucking smart.

1298
01:52:24,175 --> 01:52:25,926
We're all smart, Jeremy.

1299
01:52:34,087 --> 01:52:35,342
May I join you?

1300
01:52:39,506 --> 01:52:41,251
How is the food down here anyway?

1301
01:52:42,334 --> 01:52:43,427
Uh, it's okay.

1302
01:52:44,906 --> 01:52:48,199
- How long have you worked for the CIA?
- Twelve years.

1303
01:52:48,443 --> 01:52:51,638
- I was recruited out of high school.
- And do you know why we did that?

1304
01:52:52,348 --> 01:52:55,508
I don't think I can answer that
question, sir. I don't think I'm...

1305
01:52:55,543 --> 01:52:57,681
allowed to... answer.

1306
01:52:58,297 --> 01:52:59,224
All right.

1307
01:53:01,453 --> 01:53:04,842
What else have you done
for us, besides bin Laden?

1308
01:53:06,125 --> 01:53:07,160
Nothing.

1309
01:53:08,843 --> 01:53:10,171
I've done nothing else.

1310
01:53:13,385 --> 01:53:15,225
Well, you certainly have a flair for it.

1311
01:53:44,271 --> 01:53:45,017
No?

1312
01:53:46,179 --> 01:53:46,928
Yeah.

1313
01:53:47,798 --> 01:53:49,035
All right, let's be serious now.

1314
01:53:49,070 --> 01:53:51,064
Yeah don't fuck around on this one, dude

1315
01:53:51,462 --> 01:53:53,010
You're just fuckin' around,
'cause you see I'm up by two games.

1316
01:53:53,996 --> 01:53:54,881
How many you got?

1317
01:54:05,411 --> 01:54:06,678
Patrick, be honest with me.

1318
01:54:07,483 --> 01:54:08,911
You really believe this story?

1319
01:54:10,734 --> 01:54:13,874
I mean, no offense, no
offense, I know, but,

1320
01:54:14,405 --> 01:54:16,001
Osama bin Laden?

1321
01:54:17,772 --> 01:54:20,043
- Yeah.
- What part convinced you?

1322
01:54:22,401 --> 01:54:23,451
Her confidence.

1323
01:54:24,487 --> 01:54:27,766
That's the kinda, concrete
data point I'm looking for.

1324
01:54:28,336 --> 01:54:29,184
I tell you, buddy.

1325
01:54:29,311 --> 01:54:30,502
Her confidence is the one thing...

1326
01:54:30,537 --> 01:54:32,652
that's keeping me from getting
ass-raped in some Pakistani prison.

1327
01:54:32,687 --> 01:54:34,072
I'm gonna be honest with you, bro.

1328
01:54:36,557 --> 01:54:37,516
I'm cool with it.

1329
01:54:44,852 --> 01:54:45,579
Yeah.

1330
01:54:46,439 --> 01:54:49,401
<i>Maya, I wanted you to hear it first.</i>

1331
01:54:50,248 --> 01:54:51,782
You know that thing we talked about?

1332
01:54:51,817 --> 01:54:52,704
<i>It's gonna happen.</i>

1333
01:54:52,871 --> 01:54:54,884
- When?
- Tonight.

1334
01:54:56,944 --> 01:54:57,878
<i>Good luck.</i>

1335
01:54:58,498 --> 01:54:59,734
- Fifty bucks?
- Fifty bucks.

1336
01:55:00,173 --> 01:55:01,531
- Fifty bucks?
- Representing.

1337
01:55:02,157 --> 01:55:03,042
Fifty bucks.

1338
01:55:07,741 --> 01:55:08,790
It's a lucky shot.

1339
01:55:12,851 --> 01:55:13,816
Fuck.

1340
01:55:13,851 --> 01:55:14,566
Go.

1341
01:56:54,179 --> 01:56:54,965
Copy.

1342
01:56:56,322 --> 01:56:57,148
Copy that.

1343
01:58:45,058 --> 01:58:46,444
<i>Thirty seconds to first turn.</i>

1344
01:58:49,268 --> 01:58:51,009
Hey, Justin, what're you listening to?

1345
01:58:51,565 --> 01:58:55,070
- Tony Robbins.
- Tony Robbins, really?

1346
01:58:55,179 --> 01:58:58,071
You should listen to it.
I got plans for after this.

1347
01:58:58,811 --> 01:59:00,670
Big time. I wanna talk
to all of you about it.

1348
01:59:23,294 --> 01:59:25,281
Who here's been in a helo crash before?

1349
01:59:28,839 --> 01:59:30,301
OK, then we're all good.

1350
01:59:46,227 --> 01:59:48,764
<i>We've just crossed the
border, now entering Pakistan.</i>

1351
01:59:49,183 --> 01:59:50,974
Pakistani comms, no chatter.

02:00:15,359 --> 02:00:18,011
<i>Three minutes, stand by for doors open.</i>

1353
02:00:32,874 --> 02:00:33,781
<i>Two minutes.</i>

1354
02:01:10,868 --> 02:01:13,530
<i>Should be coming up just
off our nose, eleven o'clock.</i>

1355
02:01:21,310 --> 02:01:22,585
<i>Eyes on target.</i>

1356
02:01:27,476 --> 02:01:28,657
Stay tight.

1357
02:01:33,019 --> 02:01:34,063
Three seconds.

1358
02:02:40,410 --> 02:02:45,402
Hey! Slide right! Slide right!
Too much updraft! Now, hurry up!

1359

<i>- We've lost power

This way!

1365
02:03:47,528 --> 02:03:50,001
<i>This mission is still a
"go", I repeat, we are a "go".</i>

1366
02:03:50,036 --> 02:03:53,250
<i>Alpha Team is in the animal
pen, making entry for AC1.</i>

1367
02:03:59,521 --> 02:04:01,328
No ropes, wheels down.

1368
02:04:43,157 --> 02:04:44,500
Prayer room's clear.

1369
02:05:15,683 --> 02:05:16,484
Breacher!

1370
02:05:40,383 --> 02:05:44,516
<i>Echo Team is away, Prince
Five-Two exiting Alpha-Oscar.</i>

Ibrahim!

1376
02:07:10,503 --> 02:07:11,394
C'mon out!

1377
02:07:25,719 --> 02:07:27,122
"Erfa Edak!" (Hands up!)

1378
02:07:27,555 --> 02:07:28,257
Get down!

1379
02:07:28,292 --> 02:07:29,955
- Down, down, down, down...
- "Yalla! Yalla!" Come on!

1380
02:07:29,990 --> 02:07:30,847
Throw your hands in the air!

- "Yalla! Yalla!"
- Down! Down! Down! Down!

1382

You've killed him!

1384
02:07:36,144 --> 02:07:38,080

02:08:01,498 --> 02:08:03,320
"Yalla! Yalla! Ijlisoo!

1388
02:08:03,355 --> 02:08:05,820

- Ready to breach at P2.

1390
02:08:55,723 --> 02:08:56,847
Fire in the hole.

1391
02:09:01,871 --> 02:09:03,778
Failed breach, failed breach.

1392
02:09:04,933 --> 02:09:05,759
Back it up.

1393
02:09:05,794 --> 02:09:07,691
Back it up... main gate.

1394
02:09:19,488 --> 02:09:20,789
We got an unlocked door.

1395
02:09:33,784 --> 02:09:34,687
Abrar!

02:10:19,605 --> 02:10:22,006
It's okay.

1399
02:10:23,745 --> 02:10:24,669
<i>This is Echo Eleven.</i>

1400
02:10:24,704 --> 02:10:25,909
We're gonna breach the main gate.

Talk to me.

1407
02:11:20,958 --> 02:11:22,599
No fucking way we can blow this thing.

1408
02:11:22,868 --> 02:11:25,479
God-fucking-damnit,
can you pop it manually?

1409
02:11:26,050 --> 02:11:26,799
No.

<i>Alpha-Three...</i>

<i>Wait one, we're
internal on the south side.</i>

1413

02:11:36,376 --> 02:11:38,725
Roger, ready to make our entry out here.

1415
02:11:38,987 --> 02:11:40,599
Yeah, roger that, we're
coming to meet you.

1416
02:11:40,637 --> 02:11:42,754
Stay with these kids, and
don't let them in that backroom.

1417
02:12:02,468 --> 02:12:03,742
- Good?
- Yeah, bud.

1418
02:12:04,269 --> 02:12:07,917
Yeah. I forgot, were we
supposed to crash that helo?

1419
02:12:08,879 --> 02:12:10,654
Ibrahim tried to shoot through the door.

1420
02:12:10,813 --> 02:12:12,830
- Oh, yeah?
- I popped him from outside.

1421
02:12:13,057 --> 02:12:15,315
Oh, I fucking smoked Abrar...

1422
02:12:15,372 --> 02:12:16,272
and his wife.

1423
02:12:17,312 --> 02:12:18,360
She still alive?

1424
02:12:19,361 --> 02:12:22,091
- She's gonna bleed out.
- What a fucking mess.

1425
02:12:22,126 --> 02:12:23,005
Yeah.

1426
02:12:26,508 --> 02:12:27,661
Go...

1427
02:12:50,864 --> 02:12:54,842
This is Echo Zero-Nine, we have unknowns
gathering in the southwest rooftops.

Hey, back it up.

Go...

02:19:44,215 --> 02:19:46,600
Echo Zero-Five, you have four Mikes.

1500
02:19:47,206 --> 02:19:49,159
This is a gold mine, I
need more time than that.

1501
02:19:49,406 --> 02:19:52,058
Echo Zero-Five, if you're
not at the LZ at 4 Mikes,

1502
02:19:52,093 --> 02:19:53,526
I'm gonna leave your ass behind.

1503
02:19:53,738 --> 02:19:56,091
<i>The Paks have scrambled the F-16s.</i>

1504
02:19:56,684 --> 02:19:57,464
Four!

1505
02:19:57,499 --> 02:19:58,527
Minutes!

1506
02:20:13,715 --> 02:20:16,098
<i>Red Five-Two, inbound for LZ.</i>

1507
02:20:38,478 --> 02:20:39,615
Where do you need the bag?

1508
02:20:40,004 --> 02:20:41,030
<i>Third deck.</i>

1509
02:20:58,401 --> 02:20:59,111
Here!

1510
02:20:59,319 --> 02:21:00,021
Hey.

1511
02:21:15,545 --> 02:21:16,247
Get it up.

1512
02:21:22,571 --> 02:21:23,802
All right, let's move it out.

1513
02:21:35,361 --> 02:21:36,711
Let's go! Now!

1514
02:22:00,991 --> 02:22:03,260
<i>You've got one Mike to
blow that downed helo.</i>

1515
02:22:40,219 --> 02:22:41,635
- You all right?
- Yeah.

1516
02:23:07,995 --> 02:23:11,413
<i>Kilo-Red Forty-Six inbound
for LZ in thirty seconds, out.</i>

1517
02:23:12,890 --> 02:23:15,242
<i>Chopper Four-Six, we
were demoing Five-One.</i>

1518
02:23:15,848 --> 02:23:17,423
<i>Chopper Four-Six, wave off.</i>

1519
02:23:19,099 --> 02:23:21,061
<i>Four-Six, wave off, wave off!</i>

1520
02:25:26,962 --> 02:25:27,667
Up!

1521
02:25:34,454 --> 02:25:35,766
Whoo-oo-oo!

1522
02:25:39,425 --> 02:25:42,085
- Well done, Patrick.
- Thank you.

1523
02:25:42,815 --> 02:25:43,725
Moving through!

1524
02:25:43,760 --> 02:25:45,426
All right, listen up,
gentlemen. Read the signs.

1525
02:25:45,461 --> 02:25:48,734
1st Floor! Hard drives, files, anything!

3rd Floor, ladies' underwear.

1528
02:25:56,149 --> 02:25:57,209
We're on strike, they can't be...

1529
02:25:57,244 --> 02:25:58,701
- that many of 'em, right?
- Collect all media!

1530
02:25:58,736 --> 02:26:01,079
- CDs, DVDs?
- Who's got a Sharpie?

1531
02:26:04,059 --> 02:26:06,171
- Right here.
- Good job, man.

1532
02:26:18,312 --> 02:26:19,176
Nice job.

1533
02:26:23,335 --> 02:26:24,373
Where the hard drives go?

1534
02:26:24,408 --> 02:26:26,989
- Guys, marker on tables!
- Yes, sir.

1535
02:26:27,024 --> 02:26:29,557
We got Ziploc bags and Sharpies use them

1536
02:26:31,196 --> 02:26:32,630
You all, mark all media!

1537
02:26:34,796 --> 02:26:37,420
- Gentlemen, watch your backs.
- Slow down.

1538
02:26:38,797 --> 02:26:39,538
Thank you, sir.

1539
02:26:39,677 --> 02:26:40,377
Good job.

1540
02:26:40,412 --> 02:26:41,678
- Slow down.
- Video cameras?

1541
02:26:41,785 --> 02:26:44,034
Video cameras, where-where was it found?

1542
02:26:52,652 --> 02:26:53,556
Yes, sir.

1543
02:26:54,079 --> 02:26:55,185
One moment, please.

1544
02:27:08,605 --> 02:27:09,716
One moment, please.

1545
02:27:38,888 --> 02:27:42,003
Sir, the agency expert
gave visual confirmation.

1546
02:27:42,661 --> 02:27:46,002
Yes, sir, the girl. Hundred
percent. Thank you, sir.

1547
02:28:42,688 --> 02:28:44,844
- Are you Maya?
- Yeah.

1548
02:28:45,051 --> 02:28:46,660
That's the only name they gave me.

1549
02:28:46,695 --> 02:28:49,754
You can sit wherever you want,
you're the only one on the manifest.

1550
02:28:53,347 --> 02:28:55,133
You must be pretty important.

1551
02:28:55,911 --> 02:28:57,911
You got the whole plane to yourself.

1552
02:28:58,911 --> 02:29:00,911
Where do you wanna go?

00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000


1
00:01:35,167 --> 00:01:36,583
Out of my way!

2
00:01:58,708 --> 00:01:59,875
Ok, here they are.

3
00:02:00,083 --> 00:02:03,792
Philippe, wake up now, I bet
you 100 € that I'll lose them.

4
00:02:04,583 --> 00:02:06,125
Philippe? Deal.

5
00:02:06,333 --> 00:02:07,833
Let's do this!

6
00:02:30,292 --> 00:02:32,792
You're in a good form tonight.

7
00:02:44,083 --> 00:02:45,583
Shit!

8
00:02:47,875 --> 00:02:49,083
You lost them alright.

9
00:02:49,333 --> 00:02:52,833
Out of the car!
Hands on the hood!

10
00:02:53,083 --> 00:02:55,333
- I'll double it.
- 200 € that they'll escort us.

11
00:02:55,542 --> 00:02:57,125
You'll lose again.

12
00:02:57,333 --> 00:02:59,083
-200 € on the escort!

13
00:02:59,333 --> 00:03:00,792
- Come on! Show me your hands!

14
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,750
Your hands goddammit!

15
00:03:03,625 --> 00:03:07,292
- Wait. I'm gonna explain.
- Shut up. Hands on the hood.

16
00:03:07,792 --> 00:03:10,833
- Wait.
- Get out of the car. Now!

17
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,792
Take it easy!

18
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:16,542
He can't get out.
He can't even open the door.

19
00:03:17,167 --> 00:03:19,375
Look at the Handicap Sticker!

20
00:03:19,542 --> 00:03:24,167
The wheel chair in the trunk.
The guy's paralysed. Go check!

21
00:03:24,417 --> 00:03:25,875
Get off me.

22
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:30,917
- He's telling the truth.
- SO!

23
00:03:31,167 --> 00:03:32,667
What did you think?

24
00:03:32,875 --> 00:03:36,000
You think I'm doing 180
For the fun of it?

25
00:03:36,208 --> 00:03:40,542
I was going to the hospital.
I work for him. He's having a stroke!

26
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:41,986
The more we wait,
the worse it gets.

27
00:03:41,987 --> 00:03:43,958
He can't move, he can't do anything.
That's why I'm here.

28
00:03:44,167 --> 00:03:46,125
I think we have a problem here.

29
00:03:46,292 --> 00:03:48,458
Come see this.

30
00:03:51,167 --> 00:03:54,958
- What the fuck do we do now?
- That's right, think about it. Take your time.

31
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:59,208
Meanwhile call his 15 year-old daughter
tell her her father's dead because of you!

32
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:02,833
If he's not taken care of 
in 5 minutes, it's over. He's dead.

33
00:04:03,042 --> 00:04:05,417
But take your time.

34
00:04:06,125 --> 00:04:09,458
Think. Think fast. He's dying!

35
00:04:10,167 --> 00:04:13,750
Alright, 
don't lose any more time. Go.

36
00:04:25,833 --> 00:04:27,875
- Where are you going?
- Emergency.

37
00:04:28,167 --> 00:04:33,375
We'll escort you, it's safer.
We're escorting them! Let's go!

38
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:36,875
They're gone. They're leaving.

39
00:04:37,167 --> 00:04:38,375
Good.

40
00:04:38,958 --> 00:04:41,167
This is so gross!

41
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:44,583
Eww! I can't handle this...
How do you produce this goo ?

42
00:04:44,708 --> 00:04:47,875
OK, for now, just worry about
getting your license.

43
00:04:48,125 --> 00:04:50,292
For now let's escort you,
"it's safer".

44
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:53,250
A 200 € escort.

45
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:55,792
No way! I never bet you that much.

46
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,542
Let's set the mood to celebrate.

47
00:04:59,875 --> 00:05:01,208
"We're gonna escort
you, it's safer."

48
00:05:01,417 --> 00:05:04,333
OK, OK. I helped you out of this.

49
00:05:04,542 --> 00:05:09,750
An escort... A "safer" escort!
...
[Earth Wind and Fire"SEPTEMBER"]

50
00:06:47,667 --> 00:06:49,083
Here he comes.

51
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:52,250
We called ahead.
A stretcher is coming.

52
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,500
- Alright?
- Yeah, it's fine.

53
00:06:54,708 --> 00:06:56,833
- Good luck.
- Whatever.

54
00:07:12,375 --> 00:07:14,208
Now what?

55
00:07:14,875 --> 00:07:17,208
Now you let me decide.

56
00:07:28,083 --> 00:07:32,708
THE INTOUCHABLES

57
00:07:34,417 --> 00:07:38,125
<i>Inspired by a true story.</i>

58
00:08:23,333 --> 00:08:24,583
Do you have references?

59
00:08:24,833 --> 00:08:27,375
Well yes. I have my CAFAD.

60
00:08:27,583 --> 00:08:30,542
A Certificate of Aptitude 
for the Care of Disabled persons.

61
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:35,250
From the Bayer Institute
in the Landes country in 2001

62
00:08:35,458 --> 00:08:38,333
I have a high school
"Proximity Services" diploma

63
00:08:38,334 --> 00:08:41,208
and a bachelor's in "Social
and Family Economics"

64
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:47,125
I don't... like... I mean...
I've been studying more than working.

65
00:08:47,292 --> 00:08:49,500
What is your main motivation?

66
00:08:49,792 --> 00:08:51,625
Money. Duh!

67
00:08:51,875 --> 00:08:53,333
Humanity.

68
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:55,792
I'm all about Humanity.

69
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,292
Good for you.

70
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:01,500
To help others, I think.
Alright ? ... Good answer ?

71
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:04,042
I like the neighbourhood.

72
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:07,167
I always loved "persons of diminished
function". Since I was little.

73
00:09:07,375 --> 00:09:11,417
To promote the autonomy 
of the disabled, I'd say.

74
00:09:11,625 --> 00:09:12,667
Their social integration.

75
00:09:12,917 --> 00:09:15,542
Sports, too.
Gotta move, you know.

76
00:09:15,792 --> 00:09:17,750
For the social life, I mean.

77
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,625
These people can't
do anything...

78
00:09:21,083 --> 00:09:24,000
I had my first
professional experience...

79
00:09:24,208 --> 00:09:25,833
It was Mme Dupont Moretti.

80
00:09:26,083 --> 00:09:29,167
A really old, old lady...

81
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
really old...

82
00:09:31,208 --> 00:09:33,250
I attended her...

83
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,667
until the end, daily.

84
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:40,583
In Geriatrics we had good times too.
We had "King's cake", er...

85
00:09:40,917 --> 00:09:44,792
I'm also an expert
in administrative stuff...

86
00:09:45,083 --> 00:09:47,792
Financial aid. Welfare housing

87
00:09:48,042 --> 00:09:50,667
I don't know if...

88
00:09:50,833 --> 00:09:51,958
if you need that.

89
00:09:52,167 --> 00:09:55,292
Check it out, Magalie,
but I don't think so.

90
00:10:03,042 --> 00:10:04,917
- Yvan Laprade?
- Yes.

91
00:10:05,208 --> 00:10:10,417
Stop, alright? It's been 2 hours.
My turn now.

92
00:10:15,292 --> 00:10:16,417
Hello.

93
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:18,458
I'd like to have
a paper signed.

94
00:10:19,625 --> 00:10:21,667
Please take a seat.

95
00:10:26,583 --> 00:10:28,250
Do you have references?

96
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,292
References? Yes I have.

97
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:31,542
And...?

98
00:10:31,833 --> 00:10:32,750
We're listening.

99
00:10:32,958 --> 00:10:36,000
"Kool & the Gang",
"Earth, Wind & Fire".

100
00:10:36,208 --> 00:10:39,042
Those are good
references, aren't they?

101
00:10:39,333 --> 00:10:40,917
I don't know them. Take a seat.

102
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:43,583
If you don't know them, you don't
know anything about music.

103
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:46,458
I don't think 
I'm musically uncultured.

104
00:10:46,583 --> 00:10:48,917
- Even if I don't know your
"Sool and" whatever...
- No.

105
00:10:49,083 --> 00:10:50,167
No, "Kool & the Gang".

106
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:54,250
What about you?
You know Chopin, Schubert, Berlioz?

107
00:10:54,417 --> 00:10:56,292
You're asking
if "I" know Berlioz?

108
00:10:56,833 --> 00:10:58,500
I'd be surprised 
if "YOU" knew Berlioz.

109
00:10:58,667 --> 00:11:00,458
Even so, I'm an expert.

110
00:11:00,708 --> 00:11:01,917
Really?

111
00:11:02,542 --> 00:11:04,125
Who do you know there?

112
00:11:06,042 --> 00:11:08,583
- Which building?
- What do you mean which building?

113
00:11:08,875 --> 00:11:09,875
But, man...

114
00:11:10,083 --> 00:11:12,875
Berlioz, before being a neighborhood,
was a famous composer, 

115
00:11:13,083 --> 00:11:15,500
writer, critic of
the 19th century.

116
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:20,542
It's a joke. I know who Berlioz is.
I see humour is like music for you.

117
00:11:21,708 --> 00:11:24,375
You know nothing about it.

118
00:11:26,292 --> 00:11:30,083
Tell us about your paper.

119
00:11:31,542 --> 00:11:35,625
I need a signature...
To prove I came to the interview.

120
00:11:35,833 --> 00:11:40,333
That says, despite my skills, qualities,
or whatever usual bullshit you use...

121
00:11:40,583 --> 00:11:42,208
you're still not interested.

122
00:11:42,242 --> 00:11:44,700
I need 3 refusals to get
Unemployment money again.

123
00:11:44,708 --> 00:11:46,708
I understand, Unemployment benefits.

124
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:50,583
- You don't have any other motivation in life?
- Oh, sure I do.

125
00:11:51,375 --> 00:11:55,417
There's one right here.
That's really motivating.

126
00:11:57,167 --> 00:11:59,792
Alright, so, what now?

127
00:12:00,042 --> 00:12:01,625
Sign? Not sign?

128
00:12:01,833 --> 00:12:03,958
I'm sorry I can't
sign on the spot.

129
00:12:04,167 --> 00:12:05,000
Why is that?

130
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:06,458
Why?

131
00:12:17,333 --> 00:12:18,917
Oh, that's annoying.

132
00:12:19,958 --> 00:12:22,542
It's just... I have a deadline,
and since I'm pretty late...

133
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:25,792
It's "a bit annoying", indeed.

134
00:12:26,375 --> 00:12:28,292
Can't Miss "Motivation"
sign for you?

135
00:12:28,542 --> 00:12:31,417
No, Magalie doesn't have proxy.

136
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:33,500
It's a shame.

137
00:12:33,792 --> 00:12:36,667
She could have slipped
in her cel-number(06).

138
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:38,292
Alright, come back tomorrow.

139
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,375
9: am. Your paper will be signed.

140
00:12:40,625 --> 00:12:42,167
I surely don't want to deprive
you of your Unemployment check.

141
00:12:42,333 --> 00:12:44,750
- Sorry, I can't see you out.
- It's all good.

142
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,583
Don't get up...
I mean stay seated.

143
00:12:49,167 --> 00:12:51,000
Be back tomorrow.

144
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,250
- Mina?
- Yeah?

145
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:39,708
- Is she here?
- No. She'll be home late.

146
00:13:45,167 --> 00:13:47,125
No, no! Hey!

147
00:13:47,667 --> 00:13:50,625
Turn off the tap. 
I got no more water.

148
00:13:50,833 --> 00:13:52,500
Turn it off!

149
00:13:52,708 --> 00:13:54,375
And get out.

150
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:56,917
- I'm showering, why are you here?
- Leave me alone. 
- Out!

151
00:13:57,250 --> 00:14:00,167
Take them out. Come on.

152
00:14:00,417 --> 00:14:02,375
Bintou, I'm not joking.

153
00:14:02,583 --> 00:14:03,417
Mina!

154
00:14:03,583 --> 00:14:05,833
Mina. Get your fat belly out!

155
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:09,000
Let it go!

156
00:14:09,292 --> 00:14:11,042
Give me a towel.
Why are you still here...

157
00:14:11,333 --> 00:14:12,458
Get out, all of you!

158
00:14:12,708 --> 00:14:13,875
Bintou, come one.

159
00:14:14,083 --> 00:14:15,333
Hey! Bintou!

160
00:14:15,583 --> 00:14:16,792
What do you think you're doing?

161
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,917
Sit down.

162
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:21,083
What do you want?
Coke or this?

163
00:14:21,292 --> 00:14:23,333
I want Coca-Cola.

164
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:40,250
- Where did you come from?
- From school.

165
00:14:41,792 --> 00:14:43,208
Can you wipe the trash?

166
00:14:44,417 --> 00:14:45,750
Where are you going now?

167
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:47,625
Horseback riding.

168
00:14:47,958 --> 00:14:49,833
Be a smart ass !

169
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:29,125
It's for you.

170
00:15:32,042 --> 00:15:34,000
Where have you been?

171
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:36,750
- On vacation.
- On vacation?

172
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,125
You think people don't
talk around here?...

173
00:15:39,375 --> 00:15:41,208
...that I'm an idiot?

174
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:45,042
6 months, we don't see you!
Not one phone call. Nothing!

175
00:15:45,292 --> 00:15:48,625
And you show up, like nothing
happened, giving me a Kinder egg?

176
00:15:48,917 --> 00:15:51,583
You think I can pay the rent
with your scams?

177
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:52,708
The groceries?

178
00:15:52,917 --> 00:15:54,333
...

179
00:15:54,583 --> 00:15:57,000
...

180
00:15:57,333 --> 00:15:59,292
This isn't a hotel!

181
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,458
Look at me when I'm
talking to you !

182
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:06,167
Imbecil!

183
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:10,208
- I just can't talk to you.
- You want to talk?

184
00:16:10,583 --> 00:16:11,708
OK.

185
00:16:14,083 --> 00:16:15,875
I'm listening.

186
00:16:21,292 --> 00:16:23,958
I'm listening.

187
00:16:26,333 --> 00:16:27,917
You know Driss...

188
00:16:28,167 --> 00:16:30,333
I prayed a lot for you.

189
00:16:30,833 --> 00:16:33,000
But, may god forgive me...

190
00:16:33,292 --> 00:16:35,208
I have other children.

191
00:16:36,208 --> 00:16:39,375
I still have hope for them.

192
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:43,958
I don't want to see you
hang around here any more.

193
00:16:44,292 --> 00:16:46,417
Pack your bags.

194
00:16:46,667 --> 00:16:48,042
And get the
hell outta here.

195
00:16:48,292 --> 00:16:50,042
Got it?

196
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:52,583
Get out.

197
00:16:54,417 --> 00:16:55,917
Get out!

198
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,167
...and he's gone!

199
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:15,333
Good one, hey?

200
00:18:16,917 --> 00:18:18,333
Ok, I'm off.

201
00:18:20,375 --> 00:18:21,583
What, that wasn't funny?!

202
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:18,167
Yes?

203
00:19:18,375 --> 00:19:20,958
- I'm here for my paper.
- Yes, I'm expecting you.

204
00:19:21,208 --> 00:19:24,917
- For the... Unempl...
- Come in.

205
00:19:35,042 --> 00:19:37,750
Can you tell Philippe
the young man is here?

206
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Of course.

207
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:47,333
- So?
- The beets aren't ready.

208
00:19:47,625 --> 00:19:51,333
- But the radishes are good.
- Fine. 
- Hello.

209
00:19:57,958 --> 00:19:59,167
Shall we go?

210
00:20:01,375 --> 00:20:04,333
Just so you know,
he had a rough night.

211
00:20:04,583 --> 00:20:06,250
(Just like you, apparently.)

212
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,583
The day starts 
without fail at 7:AM

213
00:20:08,792 --> 00:20:10,583
...with the nurse.

214
00:20:10,792 --> 00:20:14,042
He needs 2 to 3 hours
of care every morning.

215
00:20:14,292 --> 00:20:17,500
You should know, most people
give up after a week.

216
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:19,833
They just "parade" through here.

217
00:20:20,042 --> 00:20:21,083
Well...

218
00:20:21,292 --> 00:20:24,250
I like the decorations 
the music, and all that...

219
00:20:24,542 --> 00:20:25,875
but I don't think I'll buy it.

220
00:20:26,125 --> 00:20:27,167
And I didn't plan my day around...

221
00:20:27,375 --> 00:20:31,167
Listen, I was asked to give you a tour,
I also have other fish to fry.

222
00:20:31,375 --> 00:20:33,042
Anyway we're almost done.

223
00:20:33,292 --> 00:20:35,542
You can communicate
with a BabyPhone.

224
00:20:35,833 --> 00:20:38,375
It's like a Walkie-Talkie.
You hear him, he hears you.

225
00:20:38,667 --> 00:20:42,708
Under the contract,
you have a separate room.

226
00:20:42,917 --> 00:20:45,083
There - the toilet.

227
00:20:46,333 --> 00:20:48,500
And there - a bathroom.

228
00:20:49,042 --> 00:20:50,875
Private.

229
00:20:54,083 --> 00:20:55,458
Yoohoo!

230
00:20:55,625 --> 00:20:57,708
It's here.

231
00:21:11,792 --> 00:21:13,375
He's waiting for you.

232
00:21:13,583 --> 00:21:16,375
One minute...

233
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,375
So I signed your paper.

234
00:21:28,583 --> 00:21:32,542
It's in an envelope,
on the little table.

235
00:21:37,792 --> 00:21:40,917
By the way, how do like 
being on assistance?

236
00:21:41,167 --> 00:21:41,917
What?

237
00:21:42,083 --> 00:21:47,000
Living on the backs of others,
doesn't bother your conscience?

238
00:21:47,208 --> 00:21:49,833
It's alright, thanks.
How about you?

239
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:54,208
Do you think you'd
be able to work?

240
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,250
I mean with duties,
a schedule...

241
00:21:56,458 --> 00:21:57,917
Responsibilities.

242
00:21:58,125 --> 00:22:00,667
I was wrong.
You do have a sense of humour.

243
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:03,892
So much so, that I'm willing
to try you out for a month.

244
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,333
Do you want a day
to think about it?

245
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,333
I don't think
you'll last two weeks.

246
00:22:39,167 --> 00:22:40,125
What?

247
00:22:40,458 --> 00:22:43,750
Not one bone not one muscle
must be overlooked.

248
00:22:43,958 --> 00:22:45,000
Everything must move.

249
00:22:46,292 --> 00:22:48,708
We want to keep the skin
and the joints in shape.

250
00:22:49,042 --> 00:22:52,500
You need to be meticulous.

251
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:53,708
Rigorous.

252
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,958
Ok? Understand?

253
00:22:56,292 --> 00:22:57,833
Hey, wake up!

254
00:22:58,083 --> 00:22:59,292
Sleep at night!

255
00:22:59,583 --> 00:23:02,083
- I'm not sleeping.
- Come help me!

256
00:23:02,375 --> 00:23:05,708
We're going to put
Philippe in his chair.

257
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,917
Then off to the shower.

258
00:23:09,708 --> 00:23:11,208
OK, here!

259
00:23:11,625 --> 00:23:15,000
Try it yourself. Show me.

260
00:23:21,125 --> 00:23:22,708
Don't be afraid. Go ahead.

261
00:23:22,917 --> 00:23:24,500
I'm not afraid.

262
00:23:36,625 --> 00:23:38,625
- There. That alright?
- Wait!

263
00:23:39,208 --> 00:23:43,125
Never leave him until
he's strapped in.

264
00:23:43,333 --> 00:23:45,375
It's one of my vices.

265
00:23:45,667 --> 00:23:47,500
No one told me.

266
00:23:49,625 --> 00:23:52,042
I'm in training!

267
00:23:52,333 --> 00:23:55,583
No need for kid gloves!
Rub, for god's sake!

268
00:23:55,875 --> 00:23:58,792
It doesn't foam!
It's a weird shampoo.

269
00:23:59,042 --> 00:24:00,625
- How are you getting on?
- I'm washing his hair...

270
00:24:00,833 --> 00:24:02,042
but it doesn't foam.

271
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:03,250
How's that?

272
00:24:03,708 --> 00:24:05,958
What the hell...
are you kidding me?

273
00:24:06,292 --> 00:24:08,375
You put the foot-ointment in his hair.

274
00:24:08,583 --> 00:24:09,875
Wait, wait...

275
00:24:10,708 --> 00:24:14,792
Please tell me you can read!

276
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,833
You're a clever one, aren't you?

277
00:24:17,042 --> 00:24:19,500
They look the same. There should be
one for the whole body.

278
00:24:19,792 --> 00:24:21,875
But there are 20.

279
00:24:22,125 --> 00:24:24,542
Ok, get a move on.
I won't be here 2 hours.

280
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:28,500
- So I'm using this one?
- The one marked "shampoo".

281
00:24:29,167 --> 00:24:32,542
- Are you gonna be ok?
- Of course, he'll be ok.

282
00:24:32,792 --> 00:24:35,167
My feet have never
been so well "permed".

283
00:24:35,375 --> 00:24:38,375
Go have your lunch, Marcelle.
Everything is fine.

284
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:41,875
Where's the matching skirt?

285
00:24:42,125 --> 00:24:46,167
Those are compression stockings.
If I don't wear them, my blood won't flow

286
00:24:46,458 --> 00:24:48,500
and I'll pass out.

287
00:24:51,583 --> 00:24:53,625
I'm not putting stocking on you.

288
00:24:53,875 --> 00:24:55,667
We have a problem here.

289
00:24:55,833 --> 00:24:59,500
Since I won't do it,

290
00:24:59,708 --> 00:25:01,708
we'll have to see if...
Marcelle!...

291
00:25:01,958 --> 00:25:04,208
If Marcelle can come back...

292
00:25:04,583 --> 00:25:06,042
and do it herself.

293
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:09,583
Since she's a girl and all,
she knows how.

294
00:25:09,875 --> 00:25:12,208
I don't know why we're debating.
I'm not gonna do it.

295
00:25:12,417 --> 00:25:16,167
Even for your sake ...
you might as well pass out.

296
00:25:16,458 --> 00:25:21,833
You just say no, put your foot down.
Marcelle, I'm not going to do it!

297
00:25:30,033 --> 00:25:36,633
You know, my stockings and your cute
little earring - they go well together.

298
00:25:36,708 --> 00:25:39,083
Cut the wise cracks!

299
00:25:39,108 --> 00:25:41,742
Looks like you've done it
all your life.

300
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:45,042
Ever thought about...

301
00:25:45,250 --> 00:25:49,000
a vocational course in beauty care?

302
00:25:51,083 --> 00:25:52,750
There. It's done.

303
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,750
What are the gloves for?

304
00:25:54,958 --> 00:25:57,208
Er... we'll wait
a while for those.

305
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:59,167
You're not quite ready.

306
00:25:59,417 --> 00:26:01,167
<i>No. He's not quite ready.

307
00:26:01,458 --> 00:26:04,167
Why "not ready"?
For what Marcelle?

308
00:26:04,667 --> 00:26:06,708
- What's that for?
- We'll explain later.

309
00:26:06,958 --> 00:26:08,500
Marcelle, we have to talk...

310
00:26:08,792 --> 00:26:10,708
Excuse me but there's
a problem with my training.

311
00:26:11,083 --> 00:26:13,875
There's nothing to "learn".
I don't do that.

312
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,100
I don't clean out strangers' butts.

313
00:26:16,117 --> 00:26:18,400
I don't even clean out
friends' butts.

314
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:20,490
I don't clean out butts in general.

315
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:22,083
Question of principle.

316
00:26:22,333 --> 00:26:26,333
Can we talk about it later?
After my lunch, for example?

317
00:26:30,833 --> 00:26:31,667
No, no.

318
00:26:31,917 --> 00:26:34,500
Actually, no need to talk later.
Let's stop it here.

319
00:26:34,708 --> 00:26:36,792
It's weird, 
but I don't like these discussions.

320
00:26:36,958 --> 00:26:40,000
I said nothing about the stockings.
It cost me, but I did it.

321
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,200
I took a step towards you,
you meet me half way.

322
00:26:43,208 --> 00:26:46,708
- Stop with the butt-cleaning.
- I think I get it.

323
00:26:46,875 --> 00:26:48,667
It's not right. I'm done.

324
00:26:48,833 --> 00:26:51,000
- Bon appetit.
- Thank you.

325
00:26:57,583 --> 00:26:59,500
- Pretty, huh?
- I love it.

326
00:27:05,167 --> 00:27:07,167
Not bothering you, am I?

327
00:27:07,225 --> 00:27:09,658
Think you're in a theatre or what?

328
00:27:09,708 --> 00:27:11,583
- I'm eating here.
- Hi.

329
00:27:12,625 --> 00:27:16,583
- You know where I can get a beer?
- Try in your hair.

330
00:27:17,833 --> 00:27:19,583
We had two 6-packs,
did you take them?

331
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:20,708
Don't know. Don't give a damn.

332
00:27:20,917 --> 00:27:23,000
So take your feather
duster for a walk.

333
00:27:23,208 --> 00:27:24,625
Come on, let's split.

334
00:27:24,875 --> 00:27:27,917
It's the new guy
works for my father.

335
00:27:28,083 --> 00:27:30,917
The "guy" has a name !

336
00:27:56,542 --> 00:27:57,458
Damn.

337
00:27:57,667 --> 00:27:58,833
- What?
- Sorry.

338
00:27:59,042 --> 00:28:00,542
- What happened?
- Nothing.

339
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:02,625
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

340
00:28:03,417 --> 00:28:05,292
I'm massaging.

341
00:28:17,167 --> 00:28:19,583
This is nuts !

342
00:28:20,542 --> 00:28:23,375
Finished playing?

343
00:28:23,958 --> 00:28:26,083
You don't feel
anything at all there!

344
00:28:26,375 --> 00:28:27,125
What the hell...

345
00:28:27,417 --> 00:28:29,875
- What are you doing?
- Experiments.

346
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:31,250
He doesn't give a damn,
he feels nothing. Look!

347
00:28:31,542 --> 00:28:33,417
Stop it, you'll scald him.

348
00:28:42,958 --> 00:28:44,083
Lawyer.

349
00:28:44,917 --> 00:28:46,333
Lawyer.

350
00:28:48,375 --> 00:28:51,417
No, it's personal.
I'll read it later.

351
00:28:51,667 --> 00:28:53,875
Personal file?

352
00:28:55,292 --> 00:28:56,417
Ok.

353
00:29:00,208 --> 00:29:02,083
Trash.

354
00:29:02,133 --> 00:29:04,117
She's got something, though !

355
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:07,998
Could't we make a hooker file?

356
00:29:13,667 --> 00:29:16,417
- Bon appetit.
- Thanks.

357
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,083
Please.

358
00:29:27,250 --> 00:29:28,667
Sorry.

359
00:29:28,833 --> 00:29:30,333
Excuse me.

360
00:29:39,292 --> 00:29:41,417
Shit, I keep forgetting !

361
00:29:44,042 --> 00:29:45,917
Fuck, sorry !

362
00:29:52,667 --> 00:29:54,208
That's good !

363
00:29:56,292 --> 00:29:57,375
Driss?

364
00:29:57,667 --> 00:29:59,250
Can you come?

365
00:29:59,458 --> 00:30:01,333
Can you hear me, Driss?

366
00:30:02,333 --> 00:30:04,167
Can you please come?

367
00:30:05,542 --> 00:30:06,750
Driss.

368
00:30:08,083 --> 00:30:09,292
Driss.

369
00:30:16,083 --> 00:30:17,125
What?

370
00:30:17,417 --> 00:30:20,000
It's almost 9.
Philippe is waiting.

371
00:30:20,208 --> 00:30:23,250
It's 9 already? I lost track of time.
My bath took forever to foam.

372
00:30:23,458 --> 00:30:26,792
- This room's a pig sty.
- Make me a coffee, I'm coming.

373
00:30:26,917 --> 00:30:29,917
The babyphone...
should always be with you.

374
00:30:30,083 --> 00:30:34,667
With Nutella! Not jams made of
fruits nobody's heard of.

375
00:30:53,625 --> 00:30:56,167
I'm not going in that !

376
00:30:56,625 --> 00:30:57,792
Even for you!

377
00:30:57,917 --> 00:31:01,958
I'm not gonna load you
in the back like a horse !

378
00:31:02,792 --> 00:31:04,625
What's this one?

379
00:31:04,833 --> 00:31:07,417
This is much less suitable.

380
00:31:09,875 --> 00:31:14,833
- Meaning?
- I have to be pragmatic.

381
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:17,792
Pragmatic?

382
00:31:20,417 --> 00:31:22,125
Oh damn!

383
00:31:22,958 --> 00:31:24,417
Son of a...

384
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:26,125
Oh, that feels good !

385
00:31:26,292 --> 00:31:28,500
- It does.
- So good !

386
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:31,000
She's got nerve !

387
00:31:31,167 --> 00:31:32,333
Let's go.

388
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:44,550
The neighbour's parked there again.

389
00:31:44,658 --> 00:31:49,217
No way to persuade him it's not his spot.

390
00:31:49,792 --> 00:31:52,667
But that might change.

391
00:31:55,125 --> 00:31:56,500
- Hi, how are ya? 
- What?

392
00:31:56,508 --> 00:31:58,792
Am I bothering you?
Wanna cup of coffee?

393
00:31:59,042 --> 00:32:00,875
- Can I see that?
- What the...

394
00:32:01,125 --> 00:32:02,125
Come here !

395
00:32:03,333 --> 00:32:06,292
Come read this. Read! Read!

396
00:32:06,542 --> 00:32:07,625
"No Parking."

397
00:32:07,833 --> 00:32:10,542
- Louder! I can't hear you.
- "No Parking"! 
- Good method !

398
00:32:10,792 --> 00:32:12,167
- Read it all !
- "Reserved spot".

399
00:32:12,292 --> 00:32:15,208
Imprint, imprint, imprint that
in your brain, and beat it !

400
00:32:15,375 --> 00:32:17,250
Piss off !

401
00:32:17,375 --> 00:32:18,917
Piss off !

402
00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:30,958
We open on tuesday.
Monday night it'll be sold.

403
00:32:31,167 --> 00:32:34,083
Shall we go? 
You've been stuck here for an hour.

404
00:32:34,292 --> 00:32:36,167
You gotta change the channel !

405
00:32:36,250 --> 00:32:38,708
There's a lot of serenity
in this canvas.

406
00:32:38,833 --> 00:32:40,708
And a certain violence.

407
00:32:40,833 --> 00:32:42,042
I find it moving too.

408
00:32:42,292 --> 00:32:44,708
Red stains on a white
ground are moving ?!

409
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,167
How much for this thing?

410
00:32:47,458 --> 00:32:50,250
I think it's 30,000 €.
I can check if you want.

411
00:32:50,417 --> 00:32:54,458
Yeah, better check.
It seems excessive, price-wise.

412
00:32:56,875 --> 00:32:59,333
30,000 € for this piece of crap!

413
00:32:59,583 --> 00:33:01,917
- Impossible !
- Oh, it's possible !

414
00:33:02,125 --> 00:33:04,833
This dude has nosebleed on a white
board, and he wants 30000 € ?!

415
00:33:05,042 --> 00:33:09,667
Driss, why do you think
people are interested in art?

416
00:33:10,292 --> 00:33:13,458
- I dunno, it's a business.
- No.

417
00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:16,458
Because it's the only trace
left of our time on earth.

418
00:33:16,667 --> 00:33:21,167
That's crap. For 50 € in a
hardware
store, I can leave my trace too.

419
00:33:21,375 --> 00:33:23,083
I can even add blue
free of charge if you want.

420
00:33:23,333 --> 00:33:26,417
Stop talking nonsense.
Give me a chocolate.

421
00:33:27,083 --> 00:33:28,292
No.

422
00:33:29,583 --> 00:33:31,333
Give me a chocolate.

423
00:33:32,625 --> 00:33:34,792
No feet, No sweets.

424
00:33:37,333 --> 00:33:38,875
It's a joke!

425
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:40,542
Hey, I'm kidding.

426
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:42,875
- Oh it's a joke!
- Well yeah!

427
00:33:43,167 --> 00:33:45,042
- A joke...
- A good one, right?

428
00:33:45,292 --> 00:33:47,500
Really funny.

429
00:33:47,625 --> 00:33:48,833
A schoolyard classic.

430
00:33:49,042 --> 00:33:51,542
No feet, No sweets.

431
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,167
Give me one.

432
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:55,167
- That's wicked!!
- Cool it.

433
00:33:55,375 --> 00:33:56,833
Oh come on!

434
00:33:57,250 --> 00:33:59,542
No legs, Philippe.

435
00:34:00,250 --> 00:34:04,083
I'll tell the tight-ass chick.
Too bad there's no audience.

436
00:34:06,625 --> 00:34:09,750
Sorry, I made a mistake
on the price.

437
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,083
- Oh, alright !
- Yes.

438
00:34:11,292 --> 00:34:13,792
It's 41.500 €.

439
00:34:14,042 --> 00:34:15,208
I'll take it.

440
00:34:16,083 --> 00:34:17,167
Wha...?

441
00:34:26,625 --> 00:34:27,833
Hi, Philippe.

442
00:34:28,833 --> 00:34:30,417
How are you doing?

443
00:34:30,583 --> 00:34:32,875
You summoned me, I'm here.

444
00:34:33,042 --> 00:34:34,333
I'm listening.

445
00:34:34,833 --> 00:34:36,708
What's so important?

446
00:34:36,917 --> 00:34:40,208
I didn't 'summon' you...

447
00:34:44,042 --> 00:34:47,667
Can you guess why I'm here? No?

448
00:34:49,208 --> 00:34:51,292
Who is this guy?

449
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:53,742
Everyone around you is worried.

450
00:34:53,833 --> 00:34:56,542
Yvonne told me he's
reckless ... violent.

451
00:34:56,833 --> 00:34:59,000
He hit a neighbour.

452
00:34:59,050 --> 00:35:03,075
Philippe, I don't need to
explain to you to be careful.

453
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:06,492
You can't let just anybody
in your home.

454
00:35:06,583 --> 00:35:08,917
Especially given
your condition...

455
00:35:09,208 --> 00:35:10,542
First of all...

456
00:35:10,550 --> 00:35:15,617
I'm not certain you know
who you're dealing with.

457
00:35:15,958 --> 00:35:17,958
Go on...

458
00:35:18,267 --> 00:35:20,999
I know people 
in the Ministry of Justice.

459
00:35:21,048 --> 00:35:23,467
He's not a mass murderer, (Mesrine)

460
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:26,333
but he has a full rap sheet.

461
00:35:26,583 --> 00:35:31,042
He's just did 6 months
for a jewelry heist.

462
00:35:31,333 --> 00:35:33,833
If at least he was qualified...

463
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,000
but I hear he sucks.

464
00:35:37,208 --> 00:35:39,708
Be careful. Guys from
the suburbs have no pity.

465
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,583
That's it, exactly.

466
00:35:42,792 --> 00:35:45,458
That's what I want. No pity.

467
00:35:46,417 --> 00:35:50,583
He often hands me the phone.
You know why? He forgets.

468
00:35:50,833 --> 00:35:53,708
So it's true. He has no
special compassion for me.

469
00:35:53,917 --> 00:35:58,958
He's big, has strong arms
and legs,
a brain that works, healthy.

470
00:35:59,208 --> 00:36:02,542
So for the rest, given my
'condition' as you say...

471
00:36:02,667 --> 00:36:06,708
Where he's from, what he's done. 
I don't give a damn.

472
00:36:06,917 --> 00:36:08,375
As you wish.

473
00:36:11,667 --> 00:36:13,542
That's all you wanted to say?

474
00:36:17,083 --> 00:36:18,583
Hey, Magalie.

475
00:36:18,592 --> 00:36:20,783
- Do you have a minute?
- No, not really.

476
00:36:20,792 --> 00:36:23,458
Not for long,
just to show you something.

477
00:36:23,667 --> 00:36:26,792
- What is it?
- Don't freak out, come see.

478
00:36:27,083 --> 00:36:30,917
- One minute, that's it.
- Deal.

479
00:36:35,667 --> 00:36:38,833
- So?
- So I have a bathtub.

480
00:36:39,042 --> 00:36:40,167
See.

481
00:36:41,375 --> 00:36:44,083
- Really fascinating...
- Yeah.

482
00:36:44,875 --> 00:36:46,708
- So what?
- So...

483
00:36:46,958 --> 00:36:48,458
we could take a bath.

484
00:36:48,625 --> 00:36:50,083
It's big. There's room.

485
00:36:50,375 --> 00:36:54,125
I have bath salts, bubbles...

486
00:36:54,583 --> 00:36:55,792
OK.

487
00:36:56,250 --> 00:36:58,125
Why not, after all?

488
00:36:58,917 --> 00:37:00,750
Yeah, why not?

489
00:37:00,958 --> 00:37:02,333
Go ahead.

490
00:37:02,625 --> 00:37:05,667
- Start undressing.
- You wanna be naughty.

491
00:37:05,958 --> 00:37:07,125
I like that.

492
00:37:07,417 --> 00:37:10,958
I'll take off my clothes.
No problem.

493
00:37:13,417 --> 00:37:14,583
What?

494
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:16,700
Hey where are you going?

495
00:37:16,750 --> 00:37:19,042
You said yes!

496
00:37:19,250 --> 00:37:22,792
Even without soap,
just a rince.

497
00:37:25,083 --> 00:37:26,125
What...?!

498
00:37:26,333 --> 00:37:30,333
When the mail comes,
I'm always a bit tense...

499
00:37:30,875 --> 00:37:32,250
As Apollinaire said...

500
00:37:32,542 --> 00:37:34,292
Colon, open quotes...

501
00:37:34,458 --> 00:37:36,458
'Without news from you I feel hopeless ...

502
00:37:36,583 --> 00:37:38,667
Wait.

503
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,833
I'm lost, you're going too fast.

504
00:37:41,083 --> 00:37:43,000
I'm still at "As Apollinaire said"

505
00:37:43,167 --> 00:37:47,333
Colon, open quotes,
"Without news of you I feel hopeless"

506
00:37:49,167 --> 00:37:53,583
Don't you get it ?
This is an intimate moment !

507
00:37:54,042 --> 00:37:56,375
- Nope, I don't get it.
- Give it back.

508
00:37:56,542 --> 00:37:58,333
I'll quit it if you explain.

509
00:37:58,542 --> 00:38:00,958
There's nothing to explain.

510
00:38:01,292 --> 00:38:03,167
He's doing his correspondence.

511
00:38:03,458 --> 00:38:04,625
Correspondence?

512
00:38:04,875 --> 00:38:07,500
- With whom?
- Mostly women.

513
00:38:07,667 --> 00:38:09,708
No kidding ! Who ?

514
00:38:10,167 --> 00:38:13,625
With one in particular.
Eleonore.

515
00:38:13,875 --> 00:38:15,958
Who is this Eleonore?
I've never seen her.

516
00:38:16,125 --> 00:38:17,250
How come?

517
00:38:17,542 --> 00:38:21,000
That's the basis of
an epistolary relationship.

518
00:38:23,333 --> 00:38:25,208
Means they write to each other?..

519
00:38:25,417 --> 00:38:27,375
Correspond solely by mail?...

520
00:38:27,708 --> 00:38:30,333
Fine, I got it.

521
00:38:32,333 --> 00:38:34,583
Are those the blue envelopes?

522
00:38:37,250 --> 00:38:38,458
He's a player !

523
00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:42,000
He 'epistols' like a pistolero.

524
00:38:42,250 --> 00:38:43,667
What about you?

525
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,250
No special little friend?

526
00:38:46,792 --> 00:38:48,625
Not even Albert, the gardener?

527
00:38:48,833 --> 00:38:51,167
- Not at all.
- I noticed it !

528
00:38:51,375 --> 00:38:54,167
He has that look just for you.

529
00:38:54,333 --> 00:38:55,792
Am I right, or am I not?

530
00:38:56,042 --> 00:38:59,300
- Stop it ! This is ridiculous!

531
00:38:59,517 --> 00:39:02,690
- Did he plant it in you ?

532
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:04,917
- What ?
- His little cucumber?

533
00:39:06,208 --> 00:39:07,417
What?

534
00:39:09,125 --> 00:39:11,792
- Am I dreaming this ?...
- Albert, Albert...

535
00:39:12,458 --> 00:39:14,125
- Soon.
- No !

536
00:39:14,292 --> 00:39:16,292
Soon, trust me.

537
00:39:35,542 --> 00:39:37,083
Fuck.

538
00:39:40,958 --> 00:39:42,208
Hello...

539
00:39:43,417 --> 00:39:44,583
You alright?

540
00:39:49,875 --> 00:39:52,667
You want the music?

541
00:40:15,125 --> 00:40:17,042
Stay calm.

542
00:40:17,417 --> 00:40:19,583
Calm down, Philippe.

543
00:40:27,708 --> 00:40:30,000
Philippe. Oh, Philippe.

544
00:40:37,167 --> 00:40:38,583
Try to relax.

545
00:40:38,958 --> 00:40:40,875
Breathe slowly.

546
00:40:43,708 --> 00:40:45,083
Are you with me?

547
00:40:54,750 --> 00:40:55,917
Breathe slowly.

548
00:41:01,667 --> 00:41:03,042
You'll be alright.

549
00:41:27,792 --> 00:41:28,917
I need air.

550
00:41:29,583 --> 00:41:30,833
Air!

551
00:42:10,333 --> 00:42:13,250
Feels good to breathe !

552
00:42:14,167 --> 00:42:17,583
- What time is it?
- Dunno, must be 4.

553
00:42:19,542 --> 00:42:22,917
Been a while since I saw Paris
at this time of the morning.

554
00:42:23,375 --> 00:42:25,042
What happened?

555
00:42:25,250 --> 00:42:28,167
It's beyond medication.

556
00:42:28,458 --> 00:42:31,625
Doctors call them "phantom pains".

557
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:38,500
I call it "being a frozen steak
in a burning pan".

558
00:42:39,042 --> 00:42:42,375
I feel nothing, yet I'm in pain.

559
00:42:44,542 --> 00:42:48,125
Hard to believe there's
nothing to relieve it.

560
00:42:49,750 --> 00:42:53,458
There goes what could relieve me.

561
00:42:55,250 --> 00:42:57,458
We're all sick over that...

562
00:42:57,625 --> 00:43:01,500
I might even be sicker than you.

563
00:43:01,917 --> 00:43:05,917
By the way, I meant to ask you...
about with women...

564
00:43:06,083 --> 00:43:09,042
Can you...? what happens with...?

565
00:43:10,167 --> 00:43:11,667
One adapts.

566
00:43:11,833 --> 00:43:14,000
But concretely...
Can you do it or not?

567
00:43:14,092 --> 00:43:20,342
Concretely, I don't know if you're aware,
I feel nothing between my neck and toes.

568
00:43:20,375 --> 00:43:22,250
So you can't.

569
00:43:23,958 --> 00:43:25,583
It's complicated.

570
00:43:25,792 --> 00:43:28,917
I can, but...
I can't always decide when.

571
00:43:29,042 --> 00:43:30,917
One finds one's pleasure elsewhere.

572
00:43:31,208 --> 00:43:32,292
Really?

573
00:43:32,542 --> 00:43:34,125
You can't imagine.

574
00:43:34,333 --> 00:43:37,167
I sure can't. What for instance?

575
00:43:37,458 --> 00:43:40,500
For instance, the ears.

576
00:43:41,292 --> 00:43:42,208
What about the ears?

577
00:43:42,375 --> 00:43:46,792
It's a particularly, erogenous zone.
Very sensitive.

578
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,917
So your thing is 
to get your ears licked?

579
00:43:51,417 --> 00:43:53,500
I'd never have imagined !

580
00:43:56,750 --> 00:43:58,208
Philippe.

581
00:44:12,625 --> 00:44:15,667
- Have a hit. It'll do you good.
- What's this bullshit.

582
00:44:15,875 --> 00:44:18,125
Go ahead and see.

583
00:44:18,583 --> 00:44:19,792
Puff.

584
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,833
Come on, puff.

585
00:44:22,458 --> 00:44:24,750
Alright, let's share.

586
00:44:26,375 --> 00:44:27,875
More.

587
00:44:31,875 --> 00:44:35,208
- A bit more.
- Enough for tonight.

588
00:44:35,708 --> 00:44:39,708
That thing about the ears intrigues me.
It really turns you on?

589
00:44:39,875 --> 00:44:42,958
So if you have red ears,
it means you're excited?

590
00:44:43,167 --> 00:44:45,083
That's right.

591
00:44:45,292 --> 00:44:49,042
Sometimes I even wake
up with stiff lobes.

592
00:44:49,750 --> 00:44:52,250
Both of them?

593
00:44:54,667 --> 00:44:59,333
I met Alice, my wife, when we were
studying Poli-sci. We were 20.

594
00:44:59,542 --> 00:45:01,500
She was tall and elegant.

595
00:45:01,708 --> 00:45:03,792
Smiling eyes.

596
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,958
I saw pictures at your place.
The blonde one, right?

597
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,250
She's not bad.

598
00:45:08,458 --> 00:45:10,875
We had an incredible
time together.

599
00:45:11,083 --> 00:45:13,792
I wish you the same.

600
00:45:14,083 --> 00:45:17,500
Damn, I loved her so much!

601
00:45:27,625 --> 00:45:30,333
Then she got pregnant
once, twice...

602
00:45:30,542 --> 00:45:33,792
Five miscarriages in a row.

603
00:45:35,917 --> 00:45:41,083
The doctors diagnosed her
with an incurable disease.

604
00:45:41,250 --> 00:45:44,583
We decided to adopt.

605
00:45:56,875 --> 00:45:58,417
Sir.

606
00:45:58,625 --> 00:46:00,542
Please.

607
00:46:01,458 --> 00:46:03,458
Please!

608
00:46:08,542 --> 00:46:09,542
Yes.

609
00:46:10,333 --> 00:46:11,250
I want...

610
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:14,083
I'll have a tarte tatin.(upside-down tart)

611
00:46:14,292 --> 00:46:18,417
But cooked through. Because there was 
a problem with the chocolate pastry.

612
00:46:18,708 --> 00:46:20,250
It was raw, it oozed...

613
00:46:20,417 --> 00:46:21,792
flowing everywhere. Weird !

614
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:25,958
That's the whole point 
of 'mi-cuit' (half-baked)

615
00:46:26,208 --> 00:46:27,958
- That's why ?
- Yes.

616
00:46:28,167 --> 00:46:30,083
I still want a tarte tatin.

617
00:46:30,292 --> 00:46:32,333
I always liked competition.

618
00:46:32,542 --> 00:46:34,708
Extreme sports, speed...

619
00:46:35,125 --> 00:46:37,833
Going faster, higher...

620
00:46:38,375 --> 00:46:40,333
With paragliding I had it all.

621
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:43,917
I could go high, 
see things from above, and breathe.

622
00:46:44,250 --> 00:46:48,875
I was raised with the idea
that one pissed on the whole world.

623
00:46:49,250 --> 00:46:52,958
I'd like to drink something.
My mouth's a bit dry.

624
00:46:54,458 --> 00:46:57,667
It's one side effect of the joint

625
00:46:57,958 --> 00:47:00,958
- What are the others?
- It makes you hungry...

626
00:47:01,167 --> 00:47:03,667
And chatty.

627
00:47:07,625 --> 00:47:11,500
In paragliding, 
bad weather can be unforgiving.

628
00:47:11,875 --> 00:47:13,500
But you went, in spite of it.

629
00:47:13,750 --> 00:47:19,125
Maybe to to share Alice's pain,
because I knew she wouldn't make it.

630
00:47:19,375 --> 00:47:21,917
Result: 
neck cervicals 3 and 4 broken.

631
00:47:22,083 --> 00:47:24,583
And just my head to get high with.

632
00:47:24,633 --> 00:47:29,558
When the pain leaves me,
I still have my mind.

633
00:47:30,417 --> 00:47:34,458
My true handicap is not
being in a wheel chair.

634
00:47:36,292 --> 00:47:38,000
It's being without her.

635
00:47:41,042 --> 00:47:43,250
What do the doctors tell you?

636
00:47:43,458 --> 00:47:46,917
With the scientific progress,
I can keep on until I'm 70.

637
00:47:47,208 --> 00:47:49,625
With massage and medication.

638
00:47:49,875 --> 00:47:54,208
It's expensive...
still, I'm a rich quadraplegic.

639
00:47:55,583 --> 00:47:57,875
If it was me,
I'd do myself in.

640
00:47:58,042 --> 00:48:01,083
That too is difficult for a quadraplegic.

641
00:48:01,417 --> 00:48:03,208
Yeah, that's right !

642
00:48:03,917 --> 00:48:06,458
Damn, that's tough !

643
00:48:07,333 --> 00:48:09,000
What's the date today?

644
00:48:09,250 --> 00:48:10,625
I don't know, the
8th or the 9th...

645
00:48:10,917 --> 00:48:12,792
So it's official!

646
00:48:12,958 --> 00:48:15,708
- What?
- You won the bet.

647
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
Your trial period is over.

648
00:48:18,250 --> 00:48:21,250
- So I'm hired?
- Of course you're hired.

649
00:48:21,375 --> 00:48:24,042
- Can I rely on you?
- Yeah.

650
00:48:24,250 --> 00:48:25,125
Good.

651
00:48:25,333 --> 00:48:29,333
Start by giving me back
the 'Fabergé' egg.

652
00:48:30,083 --> 00:48:31,542
It's a gift from Alice.

653
00:48:31,750 --> 00:48:35,958
She got me one a year. I have 25.
One each year we were together.

654
00:48:36,250 --> 00:48:38,500
I'm really attached to them.

655
00:48:38,833 --> 00:48:40,292
No. I don't know, what you...

656
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:42,792
It wasn't me.

657
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
What is it you lost...?

658
00:48:58,208 --> 00:49:00,542
Nina.

659
00:49:03,708 --> 00:49:06,958
- What are you doing here?
- Hurry up, get in.

660
00:49:07,917 --> 00:49:09,917
Put your seatbelt on.

661
00:49:20,458 --> 00:49:21,833
How are you?

662
00:49:28,250 --> 00:49:30,708
How is school?

663
00:49:31,750 --> 00:49:33,875
Why don't you answer my text messages?

664
00:49:35,167 --> 00:49:37,042
I was busy.

665
00:49:39,750 --> 00:49:42,500
So tell me, who was on the phone?

666
00:49:42,750 --> 00:49:44,667
A detective, he wanted to talk to mom.

667
00:49:44,792 --> 00:49:48,500
I faked her voice and told him
we'd be over to see him.

668
00:49:50,083 --> 00:49:52,958
Did you find my egg?

669
00:49:55,042 --> 00:49:56,500
Did you find the egg or not?

670
00:49:57,083 --> 00:50:00,500
I don't care about your stone egg !
And I didn't find it.

671
00:50:09,208 --> 00:50:10,542
What did you tell them?

672
00:50:10,608 --> 00:50:12,450
Nothing.
What would I tell them?

673
00:50:12,465 --> 00:50:15,100
They caught me with only 30 grams.

674
00:50:15,167 --> 00:50:18,325
You know: Police Custody, then bye bye.

675
00:50:18,392 --> 00:50:20,625
Shall we get a Greek kebab?

676
00:50:20,750 --> 00:50:23,333
- I'm not getting in.
- Cool it.

677
00:50:23,625 --> 00:50:25,292
- Let me go!
- Shut up. Who's taking you home?

678
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:28,333
- Who's taking you home?

679
00:50:28,792 --> 00:50:30,625
- Piss off !
- None of your business.

680
00:50:30,875 --> 00:50:32,792
- Get lost!

681
00:50:46,417 --> 00:50:49,917
"Her polished eyes are carved
in delicate minerals,

682
00:50:50,125 --> 00:50:53,542
"And in this strange and
symbolic nature...

683
00:50:53,875 --> 00:50:56,125
"And in this strange

684
00:50:57,042 --> 00:50:58,708
"and symbolic

685
00:50:59,250 --> 00:51:02,083
- "nature...
- Damn, that's boring !

686
00:51:04,167 --> 00:51:07,750
"Where the pure angel merges
with the antic Sphinx."

687
00:51:08,083 --> 00:51:10,000
I never know if 'Sphinx'
takes a 'i' or a 'y'?

688
00:51:10,333 --> 00:51:13,500
All this gives me a headache.

689
00:51:13,958 --> 00:51:15,917
It's an "i". And singular.

690
00:51:16,125 --> 00:51:18,833
What's all this crap for ?

691
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
A sphynx, daisies, angels...

692
00:51:21,625 --> 00:51:24,500
Would you care for a
guy who talks like this?

693
00:51:24,917 --> 00:51:27,667
Of course, there is
a more basic approach.

694
00:51:28,958 --> 00:51:30,917
"merges with the antic Sphinx"
What, next?

695
00:51:31,125 --> 00:51:32,917
What does Eleonore look like?

696
00:51:33,125 --> 00:51:36,000
I don't know, It's not important.

697
00:51:36,292 --> 00:51:39,000
It's intellectual. Emotional.

698
00:51:39,020 --> 00:51:42,000
I don't focus on the physical
but on a relation of the spirit.

699
00:51:42,010 --> 00:51:44,535
Fine, the spirit...
But if she's a skank.

700
00:51:44,542 --> 00:51:47,688
It's a relation with
the spirit of a skank.

701
00:51:47,692 --> 00:51:48,417
Very elegant !

702
00:51:48,750 --> 00:51:49,917
Really !

703
00:51:51,042 --> 00:51:52,750
What can I say...

704
00:51:53,083 --> 00:51:54,208
Bravo.

705
00:51:54,375 --> 00:51:57,083
How long has it been going on?

706
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,958
This guy's such a pain!

707
00:52:05,500 --> 00:52:06,667
Six months.

708
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,208
Six months?

709
00:52:08,417 --> 00:52:10,125
And you've never seen her?

710
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:12,500
She might be ugly, fat...

711
00:52:12,708 --> 00:52:14,042
or even handicapped !

712
00:52:14,050 --> 00:52:17,740
After the poem add:
'by the way, how's your weight?

713
00:52:17,742 --> 00:52:18,208
Write it.

714
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:21,750
Thanks a lot, Driss 
for your pertinent advice.

715
00:52:22,083 --> 00:52:23,875
Let's get back to it.

716
00:52:24,083 --> 00:52:25,583
Where was I?

717
00:52:26,708 --> 00:52:32,042
I think a sphynx was eating daisies,
in seventh heaven, doing weird stuff.

718
00:52:32,250 --> 00:52:33,375
Alright...

719
00:52:34,125 --> 00:52:36,750
'strange and symbolic nature'

720
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:40,625
And in this strange and
symbolic nature...

721
00:52:40,958 --> 00:52:42,000
You gotta call her.

722
00:52:42,333 --> 00:52:46,375
- Where the pure angel merges
with the antic sphynx...

723
00:52:46,383 --> 00:52:48,533
You gotta call her. 
I'm telling you.

724
00:52:48,542 --> 00:52:52,875
I can get a lot more across
in writing. Alright !

725
00:52:53,250 --> 00:52:54,333
Unbelievable !

726
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:58,708
Fine, but I'm gonna find her number.
This is stressing me !

727
00:52:59,125 --> 00:53:00,083
Hey!

728
00:53:01,958 --> 00:53:03,667
She's from Dunkerque.
That's not good.

729
00:53:03,917 --> 00:53:05,417
Put down the envelope.

730
00:53:05,667 --> 00:53:08,750
Never seen a 'Miss France' from Dunkerque.
Usually they're dogs over there.

731
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:10,625
Put that down immediately.

732
00:53:10,633 --> 00:53:14,677
She added her number. Handwritten!
It's a sign. She wants you to call !

733
00:53:14,683 --> 00:53:16,583
Leave it, please !

734
00:53:16,792 --> 00:53:20,292
She handwrote her phone number.
What do you think it means?
<i>"Call Me".</i>

735
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:22,667
<i>"I want to lick your ears".

736
00:53:22,875 --> 00:53:24,458
- Yes, Philippe.
- You're not calling her ?!

737
00:53:24,708 --> 00:53:27,375
She doesn't care about poetry.
Six months of poetry...

738
00:53:27,483 --> 00:53:28,999
The guy's nuts !

739
00:53:29,208 --> 00:53:32,315
- I won't talk to her.
- I'm gonna check if she has a weird accent.

740
00:53:32,325 --> 00:53:34,210
Dunkerquers are hicks.

741
00:53:34,225 --> 00:53:35,458
Put down the phone!

742
00:53:35,625 --> 00:53:38,917
"<i>Ah wants me some Philippe</i>"
She's gonna get some.

743
00:53:39,125 --> 00:53:39,958
<i>Hello.

744
00:53:40,250 --> 00:53:42,125
Nice voice, for starters.

745
00:53:43,042 --> 00:53:44,000
<i>Hello...

746
00:53:44,167 --> 00:53:45,333
- No.

747
00:53:46,083 --> 00:53:46,917
- No.

748
00:53:47,125 --> 00:53:49,875
<i>- Hello...</i>
- Improvise, talk about daisies and shit...

749
00:53:50,125 --> 00:53:51,208
- Eleonore?

750
00:53:51,417 --> 00:53:52,542
- It's Philippe.

751
00:53:53,250 --> 00:53:54,667
Well I...

752
00:53:54,875 --> 00:53:58,250
I'm calling you because I really
wanted to hear your voice.

753
00:53:58,417 --> 00:54:02,458
And your merest 'Hello'
overbrims me.

754
00:54:02,750 --> 00:54:05,167
<i>Hold on. I'm gonna get her.

755
00:54:05,958 --> 00:54:08,917
Cut the fancy talk.

756
00:54:09,167 --> 00:54:12,083
<i>- Hello.</i>
- Eleonore. It's Philippe.

757
00:54:12,250 --> 00:54:13,458
<i>Philippe?</i>

758
00:54:13,833 --> 00:54:16,833
I was writing you a letter, and

759
00:54:17,167 --> 00:54:20,833
suddenly I thought, why not call her?

760
00:54:21,042 --> 00:54:23,333
Don't forget to ask
about the weight.

761
00:54:23,542 --> 00:54:25,833
<i>- Pardon me?</i>
- No. Nothing.

762
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,667
"I'm in mourning, 

763
00:54:27,750 --> 00:54:28,917
"I cry, 

764
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,492
"I'm afraid. A little coolness, Lord,...

765
00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:33,290
Yes, that's it! "Vierge folle".

766
00:54:33,292 --> 00:54:34,583
You're unstoppable !

767
00:54:34,875 --> 00:54:37,000
- Great that you love Rimbaud !
- Pardon.

768
00:54:37,250 --> 00:54:38,708
- I was first in line.
- Eleonore.

769
00:54:39,042 --> 00:54:40,875
I'm glad.

770
00:54:41,125 --> 00:54:43,250
Yes, I am.

771
00:54:43,417 --> 00:54:45,958
- Chatterbox! No stopping you now.
- I'm sending you kisses.

772
00:54:47,583 --> 00:54:50,167
Everybody kisses,
Everybody licks ears.

773
00:54:50,417 --> 00:54:53,333
Good. Well... ?

774
00:54:54,167 --> 00:54:56,792
There's good news
and not so good news.

775
00:54:57,125 --> 00:54:59,542
- What about the good ?
- 116 lbs.

776
00:54:59,550 --> 00:55:01,200
- 116 lbs? That's good !.

777
00:55:01,250 --> 00:55:04,333
Unless she's three feet tall.

778
00:55:04,833 --> 00:55:06,417
The not so good news...

779
00:55:06,708 --> 00:55:08,000
she wants a picture.

780
00:55:08,417 --> 00:55:10,750
- So?
- Oh, funny guy !

781
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,208
Good evening, gentlemen.
Your tickets?

782
00:55:13,417 --> 00:55:15,500
- Good evening.
- Just there.

783
00:55:15,750 --> 00:55:17,250
- Very good.
- Have a good evening.

784
00:55:17,458 --> 00:55:19,917
- Good evening to you.
- If you want us, we'll be here.

785
00:55:20,125 --> 00:55:22,917
We won't move.
Especially him.

786
00:55:24,333 --> 00:55:27,208
Wait...
What do you think women want?

787
00:55:27,458 --> 00:55:28,417
I don't know.

788
00:55:28,625 --> 00:55:31,500
Beauty, charm, elegance.

789
00:55:31,708 --> 00:55:35,417
My ass! 
They want dough. Security.

790
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:38,583
Ask this dude.

791
00:55:38,700 --> 00:55:42,383
And you make a good case for it.

792
00:55:42,583 --> 00:55:48,417
I might be naive, but I still hope I have
something more than my bank account..

793
00:55:48,708 --> 00:55:52,875
She spent 6 months reading
your goddamn poems. And she digs it.

794
00:55:53,125 --> 00:55:54,917
She's peculiar, for sure.

795
00:55:55,125 --> 00:55:57,458
I'm sure she doesn't care
about the wheelchair.

796
00:55:57,625 --> 00:55:58,667
That's true.

797
00:55:59,750 --> 00:56:02,458
And in the north, guys beat their women
on account of the drinking.

798
00:56:02,583 --> 00:56:03,750
No risk of that with you.

799
00:56:03,917 --> 00:56:05,375
You bastard.

800
00:56:07,167 --> 00:56:09,375
Pragmatic, no ?

801
00:56:10,625 --> 00:56:12,083
Dunno if... Yeah.

802
00:56:12,333 --> 00:56:13,583
The photo is a good test.

803
00:56:13,750 --> 00:56:16,708
If she sends hers back
it means she'll go further.

804
00:56:17,042 --> 00:56:20,125
You can send your picture with
the chair, but don't overdo it.

805
00:56:20,417 --> 00:56:22,750
No need to send a
Telethon-type picture...

806
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,125
Drool and all...

807
00:56:25,750 --> 00:56:27,375
Nasty looking !

808
00:56:27,625 --> 00:56:29,500
Alright, alright.

809
00:56:42,667 --> 00:56:44,042
What's his problem ?

810
00:56:44,208 --> 00:56:46,083
Nuts falling off ?

811
00:56:46,417 --> 00:56:48,125
I kill myse...

812
00:56:51,458 --> 00:56:53,625
He's a tree.

813
00:56:53,875 --> 00:56:55,667
A singing tree.

814
00:57:02,125 --> 00:57:04,500
It's in german !

815
00:57:04,708 --> 00:57:06,167
What? Shushing me!

816
00:57:06,458 --> 00:57:08,500
It's in german anyway.

817
00:57:08,750 --> 00:57:10,750
As if it wasn't enough.

818
00:57:11,042 --> 00:57:12,667
You're all nuts.

819
00:57:12,958 --> 00:57:14,375
Oh what torture !

820
00:57:14,500 --> 00:57:16,292
- How long does it last?
- Four hours.

821
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:17,750
Oh fuck !

822
00:57:21,792 --> 00:57:24,375
You were quite a hunk
back in the day !

823
00:57:25,250 --> 00:57:26,750
Which one?

824
00:57:28,958 --> 00:57:30,417
This one.

825
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,200
Or this one... It's good.

826
00:57:36,208 --> 00:57:38,533
Wheelchair's not too obvious...

827
00:57:38,583 --> 00:57:42,375
Still, you can see the problem,
and physically you look good.

828
00:57:42,875 --> 00:57:45,100
- Are we doing this?
- I don't know.

829
00:57:45,175 --> 00:57:47,700
Didn't you have a
blast on the phone?

830
00:57:47,708 --> 00:57:48,542
I did.

831
00:57:48,833 --> 00:57:49,833
Is that all?

832
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,375
- I had a major blast.
- So?

833
00:57:52,708 --> 00:57:55,083
So put the goddamn picture
in an envelope.

834
00:57:55,250 --> 00:57:59,458
That's what I wanna hear !
We're off !

835
00:58:03,417 --> 00:58:05,083
Got a smoke ?

836
00:58:05,292 --> 00:58:07,292
Never learned to knock?

837
00:58:07,458 --> 00:58:08,667
You're painting?

838
00:58:08,833 --> 00:58:10,583
- Yes, get out!
- You're kidding me.

839
00:58:10,833 --> 00:58:13,292
Painting !
And you learned to read too !

840
00:58:13,500 --> 00:58:15,292
What do you want? Get out !

841
00:58:15,542 --> 00:58:18,708
Or what? You'll beat me?
Is that how you treat women in your country?

842
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,542
Are you stoned ?
Fuck off!

843
00:58:21,750 --> 00:58:23,708
- I'll leave when I want.
- Right! Leave !

844
00:58:23,917 --> 00:58:27,208
- See, I'm deciding to leave now.
- Leave!

845
00:58:27,500 --> 00:58:28,417
God damn it.

846
00:58:28,542 --> 00:58:32,083
Replace this picture
with the other one.

847
00:58:33,083 --> 00:58:36,250
Please post it personally,
and be discreet.

848
00:58:36,542 --> 00:58:38,000
As you wish.

849
00:58:39,042 --> 00:58:41,833
Now throw the other
picture in the trash.

850
00:58:42,125 --> 00:58:43,417
I'm losing it.

851
00:58:43,667 --> 00:58:45,292
I'm shitting bricks !

852
00:58:48,583 --> 00:58:51,208
- What's the problem?
- Your daughter.

853
00:58:51,500 --> 00:58:54,850
- I was painting...
- You were painting ?!

854
00:58:54,875 --> 00:58:56,750
Yes, whatever.
I wanted to tell you...

855
00:58:56,958 --> 00:58:59,292
Set her straight
otherwise I'll smack her.

856
00:58:59,500 --> 00:59:02,083
- Oh, calm down.
- No, I'm not calming anything!

857
00:59:02,292 --> 00:59:04,417
You agree that 
I'm your arms and legs?

858
00:59:04,625 --> 00:59:05,125
Yes, alright.

859
00:59:05,292 --> 00:59:09,167
I wanna be your hands too,
so I can give her a good one.

860
00:59:09,207 --> 00:59:11,950
Since you can't really do much
except run her over with your chair.

861
00:59:11,958 --> 00:59:15,167
Driss, don't you think
you're exaggerating? Yvonne ?

862
00:59:15,833 --> 00:59:17,000
Yvonne...

863
00:59:18,500 --> 00:59:19,458
Well...

864
00:59:20,458 --> 00:59:23,208
She might need a
slight adjusting.

865
00:59:23,417 --> 00:59:24,167
Slight ?!

866
00:59:24,500 --> 00:59:26,708
She's 16, dresses and paints
her face outrageously.

867
00:59:26,800 --> 00:59:29,600
French kisses her dust-mop-headed
boyfriend all over the house.

868
00:59:29,625 --> 00:59:32,708
But that's none of my business.
It's her education.

869
00:59:32,917 --> 00:59:35,333
What bothers me is how
she looks down her nose at everyone.

870
00:59:35,500 --> 00:59:39,000
How she talks to you. To me!

871
00:59:39,010 --> 00:59:41,783
What about respect?
We're not dogs !

872
00:59:41,792 --> 00:59:44,292
Pardon me if 
I straighten her out right now.

873
00:59:44,583 --> 00:59:48,625
Alright, I get it.
Let me talk to her.

874
00:59:50,667 --> 00:59:52,625
Then talk to her, fast.

875
00:59:53,208 --> 00:59:55,542
I'm gonna do my stuff...

876
00:59:56,875 --> 00:59:59,167
He's painting?
What is he painting?

877
00:59:59,333 --> 01:00:00,875
I don't know.

878
01:00:21,542 --> 01:00:23,667
Get up, Philippe.

879
01:01:01,750 --> 01:01:03,042
Fits you like a charm.

880
01:01:03,375 --> 01:01:05,708
Right.

881
01:01:15,708 --> 01:01:20,992
You must respect people who work for me.
It's unacceptable. Is that clear?

882
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,000
No. Get tough on her.

883
01:01:23,250 --> 01:01:25,875
And I don't want to see
your dust-mop under my roof.

884
01:01:26,125 --> 01:01:27,958
- Alright! Leave me alone!
- No it's not alright !

885
01:01:28,167 --> 01:01:31,833
Do I need to run you over with
my wheelchair to make you obey?

886
01:01:32,042 --> 01:01:34,500
That's it. We're getting there.

887
01:01:38,042 --> 01:01:40,458
- You did that?
- Yeah.

888
01:01:41,500 --> 01:01:42,750
I love it.

889
01:01:43,375 --> 01:01:46,375
I'm not saying I would
hang it at my place...

890
01:01:47,042 --> 01:01:48,500
but it's...

891
01:01:49,958 --> 01:01:52,750
How much do you think
we'll get from it?

892
01:01:53,750 --> 01:01:55,250
We'll see.

893
01:01:55,833 --> 01:01:58,875
We'll see more... or less?

894
01:01:59,083 --> 01:02:00,250
It's...

895
01:02:01,500 --> 01:02:03,083
- What the hell?
- What?

896
01:02:03,417 --> 01:02:05,792
- What ?! It was no tongue !
- You're sick !

897
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:10,708
Can you boost it a bit?
I can't run in these conditions.

898
01:02:11,167 --> 01:02:15,125
- I'm flooring it.
- It's like a tricycle.

899
01:02:16,042 --> 01:02:17,917
Will 12 km/h suit him?

900
01:02:19,875 --> 01:02:21,208
It can do 12 km/h.

901
01:02:21,333 --> 01:02:23,499
Is it the maximum?
Can't we get more?

902
01:02:23,500 --> 01:02:26,417
- It's the maximum.
- Alright then.

903
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:48,250
Oh yeah...

904
01:02:57,417 --> 01:02:58,542
No, no.

905
01:02:58,833 --> 01:03:00,750
Stick to the ears.

906
01:03:01,250 --> 01:03:02,292
There.

907
01:03:19,667 --> 01:03:21,042
- Bye.
- Bye.

908
01:03:21,375 --> 01:03:22,625
Hi Yvonne.

909
01:03:22,650 --> 01:03:25,667
No he can't hear. He's too far.

910
01:03:25,875 --> 01:03:27,708
He can't hear, Yvonne.

911
01:03:28,042 --> 01:03:29,125
Ok.

912
01:03:29,583 --> 01:03:31,833
We'll be home at 8:30.

913
01:03:32,125 --> 01:03:35,167
OK, we're leaving. Good bye Yvonne.

914
01:03:35,275 --> 01:03:37,450
- What's up with her? 
Still freaking out?
- Yeah.

915
01:03:37,458 --> 01:03:39,333
It's your surprise
birthday again.

916
01:03:39,583 --> 01:03:41,292
It's half an hour earlier.

917
01:03:41,500 --> 01:03:43,583
Every year she gets all worked up.

918
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:48,833
She invites all my family,
and it's always exactly the same.

919
01:03:49,208 --> 01:03:52,792
They mostly come to
see if I'm still alive.

920
01:03:53,042 --> 01:03:55,500
Smells contrived.

921
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:59,208
I pretend to be surprised.

922
01:03:59,458 --> 01:04:01,208
Everyone makes an effort.

923
01:04:01,500 --> 01:04:05,375
But in the end we're
just all fed up.

924
01:04:43,417 --> 01:04:44,583
Pardon.

925
01:04:45,125 --> 01:04:46,333
Excuse me.

926
01:04:46,708 --> 01:04:47,750
Pardon.

927
01:04:48,125 --> 01:04:49,500
Pardon.

928
01:04:50,125 --> 01:04:51,500
Excuse me.

929
01:04:51,833 --> 01:04:54,167
Would you mind moving over?
It's my seat.

930
01:04:54,333 --> 01:04:56,167
I would mind indeed.

931
01:04:56,500 --> 01:04:58,333
- Yes,yes, yes. Thank you.

932
01:04:58,542 --> 01:05:02,083
Shift over. Shift, shift shift.

933
01:05:02,333 --> 01:05:03,667
There.

934
01:05:04,250 --> 01:05:05,667
Very nice of you.

935
01:05:16,883 --> 01:05:19,700
The suit makes you
look like another man.

936
01:05:19,750 --> 01:05:22,458
It looks really good.

937
01:05:23,708 --> 01:05:26,500
You look like Barack Obama.

938
01:05:26,625 --> 01:05:27,792
Really?

939
01:05:30,833 --> 01:05:32,083
She has the hots for me, obviously.

940
01:05:32,667 --> 01:05:36,083
Barack Obama. How classy is that!

941
01:05:38,917 --> 01:05:41,990
It's like someone called you...

942
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,683
Raffarin. 
(Pr. Minister 1995–97)

943
01:05:44,875 --> 01:05:47,000
Or Georges Marchais. 
(head of Communist Party 1972-94)

944
01:05:55,750 --> 01:05:58,125
What are you up to?
You'll miss the concert.

945
01:05:58,333 --> 01:06:00,000
Leave me alone.

946
01:06:01,125 --> 01:06:03,375
- Having your period ?
- Piss off !

947
01:06:03,667 --> 01:06:04,833
- What is it?

948
01:06:06,125 --> 01:06:07,250
Elisa.

949
01:06:07,375 --> 01:06:08,625
Elisa.

950
01:06:08,917 --> 01:06:11,208
- Leave me alone.
- What did you take?

951
01:06:12,417 --> 01:06:13,833
What have you done?

952
01:06:16,958 --> 01:06:19,667
- Where did you find this?
- In Yvonne's purse.

953
01:06:19,917 --> 01:06:21,042
Imodium?

954
01:06:21,292 --> 01:06:23,125
What did you intend to do?

955
01:06:23,458 --> 01:06:25,250
Kill yourself?

956
01:06:25,583 --> 01:06:29,958
- You just won't shit 
for 3 months.
- Leave me alone!

957
01:06:30,500 --> 01:06:32,208
Wait... you took Ibuprofen too?

958
01:06:32,500 --> 01:06:34,667
You're gonna die!
It's serious!

959
01:06:36,667 --> 01:06:39,167
What should we do? 
Call emergency?

960
01:06:39,500 --> 01:06:40,875
What got into you?

961
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:43,375
It's Bastien.

962
01:06:43,625 --> 01:06:45,417
- What about Bastien?
- He dumped me.

963
01:06:45,750 --> 01:06:49,208
He doesn't care about me.
He called me a slut.

964
01:06:49,625 --> 01:06:50,708
That's not right !

965
01:06:51,042 --> 01:06:53,458
if I died it would suit everybody.

966
01:06:53,750 --> 01:06:55,667
Stop talking bullshit.
Let's go downstairs.

967
01:06:55,792 --> 01:06:56,708
You go see him.

968
01:06:57,458 --> 01:06:58,792
Talk to him.

969
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,833
- To who?
- Bastien. I'll pay you.

970
01:07:02,125 --> 01:07:04,167
What do you mean, pay me?
Are you sick in the head?

971
01:07:04,417 --> 01:07:06,667
I don't give a rat's ass
about this kid stuff !

972
01:07:06,792 --> 01:07:08,875
- Please.
- Talk to Bastien?!

973
01:07:09,042 --> 01:07:10,292
Pay me?!

974
01:07:11,417 --> 01:07:13,875
Who do you think
you're talking to?

975
01:07:14,708 --> 01:07:16,792
Driss, please !

976
01:07:17,208 --> 01:07:19,875
How much you got?

977
01:07:20,625 --> 01:07:22,042
You bastard.

978
01:07:24,333 --> 01:07:28,250
It has a style...
a particular touch.

979
01:07:28,625 --> 01:07:33,792
But I mean... 11000 € for an
unknown artist seems like a lot.

980
01:07:33,917 --> 01:07:35,417
Hmm...

981
01:07:36,083 --> 01:07:40,542
On the other hand, if I don't buy it,
in a year it'll be worth triple.

982
01:07:40,833 --> 01:07:42,667
And you'll say "I told you so".

983
01:07:42,958 --> 01:07:43,833
Huh ?

984
01:07:44,083 --> 01:07:45,042
Hmm !

985
01:07:45,542 --> 01:07:49,292
- Did you say he's showing in London?
- And Berlin.

986
01:07:49,542 --> 01:07:50,875
Berlin?

987
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:53,417
Well that's...

988
01:07:54,083 --> 01:07:56,375
I don't know...

989
01:07:57,375 --> 01:08:00,792
Hefty sum, 11000 € !

990
01:08:01,042 --> 01:08:05,292
<i>Give me something to go on.</i>
She has someone, is that it?

991
01:08:05,583 --> 01:08:07,125
Yes. Fred.

992
01:08:07,458 --> 01:08:08,917
What about Fred?

993
01:08:09,167 --> 01:08:11,000
They've been together
for two years.

994
01:08:11,917 --> 01:08:15,833
One day it's 'on' the next
it's 'off'... a lot of tension.

995
01:08:16,042 --> 01:08:19,292
Right now it's not 
going too well.

996
01:08:19,875 --> 01:08:21,583
- Maybe because of me.
- Mm hm !

997
01:08:21,875 --> 01:08:24,208
- Did she mention me?
- No.

998
01:08:24,708 --> 01:08:25,708
Of course, she did.

999
01:08:26,208 --> 01:08:27,250
A little bit.

1000
01:08:27,542 --> 01:08:31,458
I knew it!
She's got the hots for me.

1001
01:08:32,083 --> 01:08:34,208
Are you pulling my leg?

1002
01:08:34,215 --> 01:08:36,400
- No.
- Go on, laugh !

1003
01:08:36,410 --> 01:08:38,900
One day Magalie
will come to my bed.

1004
01:08:38,917 --> 01:08:41,208
Hope springs eternal.

1005
01:08:41,792 --> 01:08:45,000
Easy on the appetisers,
with your gastric problems.

1006
01:08:45,250 --> 01:08:50,583
I'm no doctor, but if you
take Imodium, something's wrong.

1007
01:08:59,625 --> 01:09:01,500
Pardon me. Please...

1008
01:09:01,833 --> 01:09:03,625
Can I ask you a favour?

1009
01:09:03,875 --> 01:09:05,792
A little piece for me?

1010
01:09:06,750 --> 01:09:08,292
No, Philippe! We were fine !

1011
01:09:08,625 --> 01:09:09,750
Yes.

1012
01:09:10,500 --> 01:09:14,000
The Fours Seasons, Vivaldi.
L'estate (Summer)

1013
01:09:14,292 --> 01:09:17,500
You'll see, you'll like it.

1014
01:09:32,833 --> 01:09:35,667
So Driss? Don't tell me
that does nothing to you.

1015
01:09:35,917 --> 01:09:37,083
Nope. Nothing.

1016
01:09:38,083 --> 01:09:39,458
Not at all.

1017
01:09:39,708 --> 01:09:42,500
If you can't dance to it,
it's not music.

1018
01:09:42,583 --> 01:09:46,208
Let's try something else.

1019
01:09:50,333 --> 01:09:52,250
Yeah. I know this one.

1020
01:09:52,625 --> 01:09:54,583
It's a commercial!

1021
01:09:55,167 --> 01:09:56,667
For coffee, no?

1022
01:10:01,458 --> 01:10:03,833
Oyez, oyez! By royal decree !

1023
01:10:04,125 --> 01:10:06,417
I must hasten to the
Castle of Assholes.

1024
01:10:06,833 --> 01:10:09,083
And there deliver the minstrels.

1025
01:10:09,250 --> 01:10:10,417
Let's go !

1026
01:10:11,167 --> 01:10:13,792
Yes, I'm a good knight and true.

1027
01:10:14,292 --> 01:10:16,125
That's creepy...

1028
01:10:16,375 --> 01:10:19,375
It's about guys with no clothes

1029
01:10:20,375 --> 01:10:24,042
They're running in the fields,
 but they're naked.

1030
01:10:24,333 --> 01:10:26,000
And giggling...

1031
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:27,833
Alright, enough.

1032
01:10:28,042 --> 01:10:29,875
Bach was badass...

1033
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,242
must a' been a chick magnet
with his music.

1034
01:10:32,250 --> 01:10:35,167
The Barry White of his time.

1035
01:10:35,833 --> 01:10:36,875
Oh I know this one.

1036
01:10:37,417 --> 01:10:39,625
Everyone knows it.

1037
01:10:39,833 --> 01:10:41,250
Of course.

1038
01:10:41,283 --> 01:10:44,292
"You have reached the Paris
unemployment agency."

1039
01:10:44,542 --> 01:10:46,692
"All our lines are busy."

1040
01:10:46,700 --> 01:10:49,917
"Estimated waiting
time is, two years."

1041
01:10:57,208 --> 01:11:00,042
Tom and Jerry, isn't it ?

1042
01:11:06,458 --> 01:11:08,167
Tom and Jerry...

1043
01:11:08,375 --> 01:11:09,875
What a jerk !

1044
01:11:09,880 --> 01:11:11,208
Help !

1045
01:11:11,217 --> 01:11:12,825
Help ! It's a masterpiece...

1046
01:11:14,417 --> 01:11:17,917
My turn, now. We listened to
your classics, let's listen to mine.

1047
01:11:18,083 --> 01:11:21,750
Earth, Wind & Fire. We talked about them.
Listen it's a smash !

1048
01:11:25,375 --> 01:11:26,458
It's something else.

1049
01:11:26,667 --> 01:11:28,208
That's something else for sure.

1050
01:11:28,300 --> 01:11:31,990
Am I right? ... Don't call 
'cause I ain't answering.

1051
01:11:32,083 --> 01:11:33,208
Driss.

1052
01:11:33,500 --> 01:11:35,875
- Driss.
- I can't hear you !

1053
01:12:10,167 --> 01:12:11,983
Come on, it's his birthday,
dance !

1054
01:12:12,125 --> 01:12:15,500
Come on. For Philippe.

01:12:16,293 --> 01:12:18,709
That's it, Yvonne.
Great, Albert.

1055
01:13:00,833 --> 01:13:01,958
Hup !

1056
01:13:07,667 --> 01:13:08,833
So...

1057
01:13:10,208 --> 01:13:12,500
With all that I didn't
give you my present,

1058
01:13:12,708 --> 01:13:14,000
it arrived this morning.

1059
01:13:14,333 --> 01:13:17,042
I didn't want to ruin the party,
in case she was ugly or ...

1060
01:13:17,292 --> 01:13:20,250
You never know.
At least she answered.

1061
01:13:20,542 --> 01:13:22,833
Well... Good night!

1062
01:13:23,875 --> 01:13:27,208
Alright, I'll open it,
It'd take you too long.

1063
01:13:29,583 --> 01:13:30,792
So?

1064
01:13:32,667 --> 01:13:35,375
She's not a dog.
Not at all.

1065
01:13:35,708 --> 01:13:37,183
Oh damn...!

1066
01:13:37,192 --> 01:13:40,783
The only girl in Dunkerque
with all her teeth !

1067
01:13:40,792 --> 01:13:41,875
There's a note with it.

1068
01:13:42,083 --> 01:13:48,042
'Passing through Paris next week.
I'm waiting for your call.' 'Dot dot dot.'

1069
01:13:48,875 --> 01:13:50,333
You know what it means "3 dots"?

1070
01:13:50,542 --> 01:13:52,500
What does it mean?

1071
01:13:52,667 --> 01:13:55,333
- Is that good ?
- Of course it's good, she wants you.

1072
01:13:55,342 --> 01:13:59,490
1 dot, 2 dots, 3 dots:
she wants to snag you - end of story.

1073
01:13:59,499 --> 01:14:02,333
- I'm gonna get snagged.

1074
01:14:02,917 --> 01:14:03,833
Feels good, doesn't it?

1075
01:14:04,167 --> 01:14:06,958
- I'll never get to sleep.
- But you will.

1076
01:14:07,833 --> 01:14:09,417
I'll put it here.

1077
01:14:10,333 --> 01:14:12,042
She's watching you sleep.

1078
01:14:12,583 --> 01:14:13,458
There.

1079
01:14:13,833 --> 01:14:15,708
Good night, Philippe.

1080
01:14:15,958 --> 01:14:18,625
Sweet dreams.

1081
01:14:29,625 --> 01:14:32,583
Shall we try the hat again?

1082
01:14:34,083 --> 01:14:36,125
- Not bad.
- No.

1083
01:14:36,250 --> 01:14:38,417
No, not the hat. 
Looks like a chimney-sweep.

1084
01:14:38,750 --> 01:14:39,958
He can't be too conservative.

1085
01:14:40,167 --> 01:14:42,375
- What did I just say?
- Ok, so it's too classic.

1086
01:14:42,542 --> 01:14:46,583
- Let's forget the hats.

1087
01:14:47,500 --> 01:14:49,625
Classic or Grand Style?

1088
01:14:49,917 --> 01:14:51,333
There's something.

1089
01:14:51,667 --> 01:14:53,000
It works.

1090
01:14:53,208 --> 01:14:55,083
- What about some fishing?
- Jerk.

1091
01:14:55,667 --> 01:14:57,917
- Let's ride to Dunkerque
- Come on.

1092
01:14:58,208 --> 01:15:01,083
Yvonne will take me there.
I'll go alone.

1093
01:15:01,333 --> 01:15:03,917
- Really?
- It's ok.

1094
01:15:04,458 --> 01:15:06,625
Yes. I'll manage.

1095
01:15:06,917 --> 01:15:08,750
Alright.

1096
01:15:12,583 --> 01:15:14,333
I think I'm freaking
out a little.

1097
01:15:14,750 --> 01:15:17,667
Doesn't show at all.

1098
01:15:19,625 --> 01:15:21,667
4ac minus B².

1099
01:15:21,958 --> 01:15:23,000
B² ?!

1100
01:15:23,167 --> 01:15:25,292
I got 20, not B squ...

1101
01:15:25,458 --> 01:15:26,292
Hey.

1102
01:15:26,958 --> 01:15:29,333
Dave ? Take a hike.

1103
01:15:29,500 --> 01:15:31,750
- So Bastien, remember me?
- Yeah.

1104
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:33,000
- Oh yeah?
- What is it?

1105
01:15:33,167 --> 01:15:35,333
It's not right what you said to Elisa.
Not very nice.

1106
01:15:35,500 --> 01:15:36,833
- I didn't say anything.
- Shut up !

1107
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,333
Now you'll act like a
man and apologise.

1108
01:15:39,542 --> 01:15:41,750
- I'm sorry, man.
- Hands off me.

1109
01:15:42,042 --> 01:15:44,167
- Not to me, to her!
- Ok, to her.

1110
01:15:44,375 --> 01:15:46,667
And you'll bring her
croissants every morning.

1111
01:15:46,875 --> 01:15:48,292
- Plain or with butter?
- What?

1112
01:15:48,458 --> 01:15:51,125
- Plain or with butter?
- Whatever. I don't care.

1113
01:15:51,292 --> 01:15:52,750
Do as you want, but do it right.

1114
01:15:52,958 --> 01:15:54,750
- You be nice.
- Yes. I'll be very nice.

1115
01:15:54,958 --> 01:15:56,917
Now beat it. Move!

1116
01:15:57,542 --> 01:16:00,833
And comb your hair.
Wear a barrette.

1117
01:16:03,042 --> 01:16:04,583
What time is it?

1118
01:16:06,250 --> 01:16:07,417
4:45

1119
01:16:15,167 --> 01:16:17,667
Should I lose the hat?

1120
01:16:18,458 --> 01:16:20,500
Yeah. That's better.

1121
01:16:28,292 --> 01:16:30,167
What time is it?

1122
01:16:30,375 --> 01:16:34,000
46 - 47.
It doesn't change that fast.

1123
01:16:34,917 --> 01:16:36,750
I'd like a whisky.

1124
01:16:37,167 --> 01:16:38,208
Yeah.

1125
01:16:41,583 --> 01:16:43,042
Sir !

1126
01:17:16,667 --> 01:17:17,667
Another.

1127
01:17:18,167 --> 01:17:19,875
You're going on a date
I don't know if...

1128
01:17:20,125 --> 01:17:21,583
A double !

1129
01:17:23,917 --> 01:17:27,083
Sir, a double whisky please.

1130
01:17:56,917 --> 01:17:58,625
- Hello.
- Hello, Driss.

1131
01:17:58,917 --> 01:18:00,583
What are you doing?
Am I disturbing you?

1132
01:18:00,792 --> 01:18:02,750
I'm working out. So ?...

1133
01:18:02,958 --> 01:18:05,333
Feel like getting away?

1134
01:18:05,833 --> 01:18:07,458
No questions?

1135
01:18:07,750 --> 01:18:08,958
No. No questions.

1136
01:18:09,167 --> 01:18:11,792
- You wanna split?
- Yes.

1137
01:18:12,958 --> 01:18:14,083
Where to ?

1138
01:18:14,917 --> 01:18:16,792
To breathe a little.

1139
01:18:17,208 --> 01:18:19,167
Breathe a little?

1140
01:18:20,333 --> 01:18:22,583
I'll have a shower then come.

1141
01:18:24,833 --> 01:18:26,417
OK, let's go. Take the hat.

1142
01:18:26,667 --> 01:18:29,792
- But it's barely 6.
- We're going !

1143
01:19:06,625 --> 01:19:08,833
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

1144
01:19:15,083 --> 01:19:18,708
Give him so champagne too.
It'll de-stress him.

1145
01:19:18,875 --> 01:19:21,833
- I'm not stressed.
- Really? - No.

1146
01:19:39,208 --> 01:19:40,708
It's only us?

1147
01:19:41,875 --> 01:19:45,292
No other people coming ?
It's just us ?

1148
01:20:04,667 --> 01:20:06,750
I'm not reassured.

1149
01:20:07,042 --> 01:20:08,250
Why?

1150
01:20:08,917 --> 01:20:10,375
I don't know.

1151
01:20:11,583 --> 01:20:14,125
Tell me you're not
the unluckiest person !

1152
01:20:14,417 --> 01:20:15,750
The accident...

1153
01:20:15,875 --> 01:20:18,000
The wheelchair... Your wife.

1154
01:20:18,375 --> 01:20:21,292
You got a Kennedy thing going on.

1155
01:20:22,500 --> 01:20:24,250
- Miss.
- Yes?

1156
01:20:24,458 --> 01:20:27,042
Can you give him the package, please?

1157
01:20:27,375 --> 01:20:28,792
Thank you.

1158
01:20:33,083 --> 01:20:34,583
Thank you.

1159
01:20:35,333 --> 01:20:36,750
Why?

1160
01:20:45,167 --> 01:20:46,250
What's that?

1161
01:20:46,417 --> 01:20:50,792
That's your worth in the art market.
I got 11000 € for your painting.

1162
01:20:51,042 --> 01:20:54,000
Keep at it, you have
a hell of a talent.
- Yup.

1163
01:20:54,167 --> 01:20:56,542
A very good deal.

1164
01:20:56,667 --> 01:20:59,292
I felt it... It was cool ... Like an instinct.

1165
01:20:59,583 --> 01:21:03,500
With the music and all...
A really nice mix...

1166
01:21:03,792 --> 01:21:07,542
Then, a sort of revelation
lit up...

1167
01:21:07,750 --> 01:21:09,125
Don't overdo it.

1168
01:21:09,292 --> 01:21:11,750
11000 €, though,
It's incredible... Aah !

1169
01:21:12,667 --> 01:21:14,458
What was that?

1170
01:21:14,708 --> 01:21:18,083
Nothing, just a hole in the cabin.
We probably won't make it.

1171
01:21:18,417 --> 01:21:20,875
Philippe, 
tell me if there's a problem.

1172
01:21:21,208 --> 01:21:22,542
It was nice knowing you.

1173
01:21:22,750 --> 01:21:24,917
Philippe, I don't like these gags.

1174
01:21:25,167 --> 01:21:29,167
No, really, you're used to drama.
I'm not.

1175
01:22:00,583 --> 01:22:02,750
You gotta be totally
insane to do that.

1176
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:04,167
A bit, yeah.

1177
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,083
I gotta tell you, Philippe.

1178
01:22:12,333 --> 01:22:16,792
- You're seriously insane.
- Really? I didn't know that.

1179
01:22:18,375 --> 01:22:21,542
- Now you rig up Driss.
- Sure.

1180
01:22:21,833 --> 01:22:24,250
In your dreams !
I don't want any part of this.

1181
01:22:25,083 --> 01:22:26,125
I'll be waiting over there.

1182
01:22:26,375 --> 01:22:28,292
Taking pictures.
'Rig up Driss' !

1183
01:22:29,167 --> 01:22:31,417
How are you gonna take pictures?

1184
01:22:31,792 --> 01:22:35,125
Laugh it up.
I'm not doing this.

1185
01:22:47,958 --> 01:22:50,042
- No way !
- Wait.

1186
01:22:50,375 --> 01:22:52,000
- Take it off.
- Wait, wait.

1187
01:22:52,167 --> 01:22:54,375
I don't have to do this.

1188
01:23:02,792 --> 01:23:04,417
Wait, I don't wanna !
Hey, my shoe !

1189
01:23:04,625 --> 01:23:05,583
What's wrong?

1190
01:23:05,833 --> 01:23:07,292
My shoe !

1191
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:10,167
Motherfucker !

1192
01:23:10,417 --> 01:23:12,625
We're climbing higher?

1193
01:23:24,083 --> 01:23:25,458
What's going on?

1194
01:23:25,750 --> 01:23:26,708
Oh my god !

1195
01:23:26,875 --> 01:23:28,000
Hey, Driss!

1196
01:23:29,417 --> 01:23:31,583
Relax, for god's sake.

1197
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,383
I'm relaxed.
Let's get down now.

1198
01:23:34,390 --> 01:23:36,950
I've seen it, it's cool.
I'm done. Aaahh!!

1199
01:23:40,125 --> 01:23:42,342
Oh daaaamn !!

1200
01:23:44,583 --> 01:23:47,042
What is happening now?

1201
01:23:52,917 --> 01:23:54,167
Come on, Driss.

1202
01:24:20,792 --> 01:24:22,000
Listen to this.

1203
01:24:22,667 --> 01:24:24,083
Where can you find
a quadraplegic?

1204
01:24:24,333 --> 01:24:26,667
I don't know.

1205
01:24:26,958 --> 01:24:29,625
Just where you left him.

1206
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,458
Good one, hey?

1207
01:24:32,667 --> 01:24:34,833
You're a bastard !

1208
01:24:36,708 --> 01:24:39,833
Driss, someone's here for you.

1209
01:24:41,583 --> 01:24:42,958
Why the fuck are you here?

1210
01:24:43,500 --> 01:24:45,083
You're hiding out in all this?

1211
01:24:45,250 --> 01:24:47,667
- How'd you get the address?

1212
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,875
This letter from the
unemployment agency has the address.

1213
01:24:51,833 --> 01:24:53,750
- And what's that?
- Nothing. Let it go.

1214
01:24:53,917 --> 01:24:56,000
- What did you do?
- I fell from my scooter.

1215
01:24:56,208 --> 01:24:57,667
- From your scooter?
- Yeah.

1216
01:24:57,875 --> 01:25:00,333
Bullshit! Get up.

1217
01:25:00,833 --> 01:25:03,042
Scooter !... This way.

1218
01:25:06,417 --> 01:25:08,000
Damn !

1219
01:25:11,708 --> 01:25:13,042
You sleep here?

1220
01:25:13,292 --> 01:25:16,000
- Tell me what happened.
- Nothing.

1221
01:25:16,333 --> 01:25:19,167
- Tell me.
- Not your problem.
Just a little swelling.

1222
01:25:19,333 --> 01:25:22,000
How is it not my problem?
You come to hide out here 
but it's not my problem?

1223
01:25:22,010 --> 01:25:24,767
We were only four and they screwed us.
But don't worry, we'll get 'em.

1224
01:25:24,792 --> 01:25:26,917
You're not gonna 'get' anyone
Does mom know?

1225
01:25:27,125 --> 01:25:27,792
No, what for?

1226
01:25:28,042 --> 01:25:30,042
- Don't worry, I'll handle it.
- You'll handle nothing !

1227
01:25:30,208 --> 01:25:31,833
- You're getting on my nerves.
- Alright.

1228
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,333
Now don't touch anything
and wait here, got it?

1229
01:25:34,500 --> 01:25:37,375
- Can I lie down?
- You touch nothing!

1230
01:25:37,583 --> 01:25:39,167
Alright, I got it.

1231
01:25:39,667 --> 01:25:41,542
Moron...

1232
01:25:45,208 --> 01:25:47,083
<i>It's alright, he's with me.

1233
01:25:47,292 --> 01:25:48,708
<i>Mina, stop crying .

1234
01:25:49,167 --> 01:25:51,667
<i>He's not wounded,
it's just a scratch.

1235
01:25:51,792 --> 01:25:52,750
<i>It's nothing!

1236
01:25:52,958 --> 01:25:56,917
<i>Don't talk nonsense, Mina.
Nobody's gonna kill anybody.

1237
01:25:57,167 --> 01:25:58,333
<i>It's only threats. Only words.

1238
01:25:58,667 --> 01:26:01,667
<i>I can't take care of him.
I'm working.

1239
01:26:01,917 --> 01:26:04,333
<i>No, don't tell her.

1240
01:26:04,500 --> 01:26:08,167
<i>Go in your room and cry if you want,
but don't tell her anything.

1241
01:26:16,250 --> 01:26:17,750
Time for bed, huh?

1242
01:26:18,042 --> 01:26:20,458
I'm gonna stay up for a bit.

1243
01:26:21,125 --> 01:26:22,583
Sit down.

1244
01:26:24,333 --> 01:26:26,250
Sit down here.

1245
01:26:34,458 --> 01:26:37,375
What does that woman do for you?

1246
01:26:37,958 --> 01:26:41,083
- Dunno, she looks hot.
- Besides that.

1247
01:26:42,250 --> 01:26:44,500
Shall we go upstairs now...
I have a thing to ...

1248
01:26:44,792 --> 01:26:46,667
I imagine she gets up...

1249
01:26:46,958 --> 01:26:48,583
turns around...

1250
01:26:48,875 --> 01:26:52,167
and I finally discover her face.

1251
01:26:54,708 --> 01:26:56,417
The kid resembles you.

1252
01:26:56,625 --> 01:26:59,250
- Adama?
- That's right.

1253
01:26:59,542 --> 01:27:01,125
I saw him earlier.

1254
01:27:01,417 --> 01:27:03,292
I think if I had crossed
him in the street,

1255
01:27:03,625 --> 01:27:06,292
I could have told he
was your brother.

1256
01:27:06,500 --> 01:27:07,708
That's funny.

1257
01:27:08,958 --> 01:27:09,792
Why?

1258
01:27:10,250 --> 01:27:12,875
Because he's not my brother.

1259
01:27:13,208 --> 01:27:14,375
Really?

1260
01:27:15,042 --> 01:27:16,917
It's complicated.

1261
01:27:18,083 --> 01:27:21,375
Is he your brother or not?

1262
01:27:25,542 --> 01:27:27,458
Fine, I get it.

1263
01:27:28,750 --> 01:27:30,542
Alright, let's go.

1264
01:27:37,792 --> 01:27:39,958
My parents...

1265
01:27:40,750 --> 01:27:43,167
...are'nt really my parents.

1266
01:27:43,333 --> 01:27:45,667
They're my uncle and my aunt.

1267
01:27:46,042 --> 01:27:49,500
They came to get me in
Senegal when I was 8.

1268
01:27:49,833 --> 01:27:53,375
They couldn't have kids, so they went
to see a brother who had a load of them.

1269
01:27:53,708 --> 01:27:55,875
They took the eldest.

1270
01:27:56,333 --> 01:27:57,875
Me.

1271
01:28:00,250 --> 01:28:02,000
Actually, I'm called Bakary.

1272
01:28:02,125 --> 01:28:04,567
That's my real name.

1273
01:28:04,600 --> 01:28:08,600
There were already a few Bakarys in the
neighbourhood so they called me Idriss.

1274
01:28:08,613 --> 01:28:10,708
Somehow it turned into Driss.

1275
01:28:11,458 --> 01:28:12,333
Then what?

1276
01:28:12,792 --> 01:28:16,208
Then out of nowhere my mother...
I mean my aunt...

1277
01:28:16,542 --> 01:28:19,375
she got pregnant twice.

1278
01:28:19,792 --> 01:28:21,042
Then my uncle died.

1279
01:28:21,375 --> 01:28:23,125
And then there were other
guys, other kids.

1280
01:28:23,458 --> 01:28:26,083
I told you it's complicated.

1281
01:28:26,958 --> 01:28:32,167
About Adama. Don't you think
he needs a light admonition?

1282
01:28:39,250 --> 01:28:42,667
He came to look for you, didn't he?

1283
01:28:45,292 --> 01:28:46,417
Driss.

1284
01:28:49,875 --> 01:28:51,625
I think we'll end it here.

1285
01:28:52,208 --> 01:28:56,375
You're not going to push
a wheelchair your whole life.

1286
01:28:56,667 --> 01:29:02,583
You worked hard, 
you've earned your unemployment check.

1287
01:29:05,625 --> 01:29:06,875
Alright.

1288
01:29:07,083 --> 01:29:08,333
Let's go.

1289
01:29:08,792 --> 01:29:09,958
Come on.

1290
01:29:10,333 --> 01:29:11,500
Yeah.

1291
01:29:15,250 --> 01:29:17,875
Vassary Bakary. Bakary Vassary.

1292
01:29:18,125 --> 01:29:19,042
It's beautiful.

1293
01:29:19,458 --> 01:29:20,917
Very poetic.

1294
01:29:21,333 --> 01:29:23,250
It has an alliteration.

1295
01:29:23,458 --> 01:29:26,792
- Do you know what an alliteration is?
- No.

1296
01:29:29,333 --> 01:29:31,958
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Bastien. Thank you.

1297
01:29:32,250 --> 01:29:35,750
Tomorrow we're having a brunch.
Could you bring something more...

1298
01:29:35,958 --> 01:29:36,917
Of course.

1299
01:29:37,042 --> 01:29:39,208
- Goodbye Yvonne.
- You didn't forget my puff pastry?

1300
01:29:39,333 --> 01:29:40,250
No.

1301
01:29:40,583 --> 01:29:42,542
- Good, thanks.
- Say hello to Elisa.

1302
01:29:42,917 --> 01:29:43,792
See you tomorrow.

1303
01:29:44,292 --> 01:29:47,167
<i>Bastien, buddy, what's up? It's me !

1304
01:29:53,833 --> 01:29:55,083
So it's true.

1305
01:29:55,292 --> 01:29:56,792
- You're leaving.
- Yeah.

1306
01:29:57,083 --> 01:30:00,667
Don't worry, I have your number.
I'll call you. We'll stay in touch.

1307
01:30:01,500 --> 01:30:04,708
- It's gonna be tough on you.
You have to be strong.
- It's a shame.

1308
01:30:04,917 --> 01:30:08,458
You know I'm getting your room?
There's a water leak in mine.

1309
01:30:08,708 --> 01:30:10,583
I might stay, after all.

1310
01:30:10,792 --> 01:30:13,375
We could cuddle up
in the bed together.

1311
01:30:13,792 --> 01:30:17,292
It would be a bit cramped.
I'm not alone.

1312
01:30:17,667 --> 01:30:18,792
Here, ...

1313
01:30:19,500 --> 01:30:22,958
- may I introduce Frederique.
- Hello.

1314
01:30:24,625 --> 01:30:25,792
Hi.

1315
01:30:30,083 --> 01:30:31,208
Alright...

1316
01:30:31,500 --> 01:30:34,125
- What?
- I get it. It's your...

1317
01:30:34,583 --> 01:30:36,667
So that's why...

1318
01:30:36,917 --> 01:30:38,500
Yes.

1319
01:30:39,750 --> 01:30:40,750
Well.

1320
01:30:41,292 --> 01:30:44,833
No good bye kiss, then.

1321
01:30:49,083 --> 01:30:52,083
I have nothing against 
a threesome.

1322
01:30:53,958 --> 01:30:56,042
Well... I'm raring to go.

1323
01:30:56,292 --> 01:31:00,250
Not now though, I have to leave.
But I can come back, if you want

1324
01:31:00,875 --> 01:31:04,375
- I've got stuff, 
but I'll be back.
- I'm joking.

1325
01:31:08,042 --> 01:31:09,083
Alright...

1326
01:31:09,333 --> 01:31:11,750
See you, dudes.

1327
01:31:14,042 --> 01:31:16,583
Mr Michel Saloudy.

1328
01:31:21,417 --> 01:31:24,458
Keep it always on channel 2.

1329
01:31:24,750 --> 01:31:26,333
Are you mad at me about Magalie?

1330
01:31:26,542 --> 01:31:28,417
No. Well played.

1331
01:31:28,875 --> 01:31:30,000
Nice one, but...

1332
01:31:30,900 --> 01:31:36,250
it seemed weird how she could resist me.
It never happened before.

1333
01:31:38,292 --> 01:31:40,250
Kiss?

1334
01:31:41,375 --> 01:31:43,042
Yes. Sure.

1335
01:31:45,708 --> 01:31:47,625
Yvonne.

1336
01:31:48,917 --> 01:31:51,208
You leg puller, you!

1337
01:31:51,500 --> 01:31:53,000
Later.

1338
01:31:53,292 --> 01:31:55,125
Yvonne.

1339
01:31:56,708 --> 01:31:58,125
Wait.

1340
01:32:03,875 --> 01:32:07,500
We won't need that any more.

1341
01:32:08,500 --> 01:32:10,333
Bye.

1342
01:32:13,750 --> 01:32:15,500
Watch your foot.

1343
01:32:15,667 --> 01:32:17,125
Let's go.

1344
01:32:32,417 --> 01:32:33,583
Wait.

1345
01:32:35,417 --> 01:32:36,792
What's your bank?

1346
01:32:37,750 --> 01:32:38,500
Ok.

1347
01:32:38,708 --> 01:32:39,833
Excuse me.

1348
01:32:40,083 --> 01:32:43,625
Could you please move your car?
You can't park here.

1349
01:32:43,917 --> 01:32:44,958
It's marked over there.

1350
01:32:45,417 --> 01:32:46,625
- I'm moving.
- Thanks.

1351
01:32:46,833 --> 01:32:48,750
I'll call you back.

1352
01:32:51,417 --> 01:32:54,250
Why bust his balls?
We're not even driving.

1353
01:32:54,542 --> 01:32:56,708
A question of principle.

1354
01:32:58,208 --> 01:32:59,333
Go on, ahead.

1355
01:32:59,917 --> 01:33:02,583
Wait for me over there.

1356
01:33:13,958 --> 01:33:15,458
What are you doing?

1357
01:33:16,417 --> 01:33:17,917
I'm coming.

1358
01:34:55,583 --> 01:34:57,958
I can cancel my date you know.

1359
01:34:58,083 --> 01:34:59,875
Of course not.
Why would you do that?

1360
01:35:00,042 --> 01:35:02,542
Go, have a good time.
Everything's fine.

1361
01:35:03,625 --> 01:35:05,708
OK, Yvonne? I'm ready.

1362
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:07,792
Good. I'm coming.

1363
01:35:08,208 --> 01:35:09,708
Well, everything's ready.

1364
01:35:10,083 --> 01:35:11,667
You just have to serve.

1365
01:35:11,792 --> 01:35:16,042
Call me if anything's wrong.

1366
01:35:19,125 --> 01:35:21,833
- Call me, ok?
- Yeah.

1367
01:35:23,625 --> 01:35:26,958
So if you're ready,
I'll serve your meal.

1368
01:35:27,333 --> 01:35:31,667
Take that lab-coat off.
Feels like I'm in an asylum.

1369
01:35:31,958 --> 01:35:34,708
- Alright.
- Do you have a cigarette?

1370
01:35:35,125 --> 01:35:37,958
No. I don't smoke. Not any more.

1371
01:35:38,750 --> 01:35:42,083
I gave it up recently and I think...

1372
01:35:42,292 --> 01:35:43,792
for you it's not advisable.

1373
01:35:44,042 --> 01:35:47,208
Even if you're not
exercising or something...

1374
01:35:47,417 --> 01:35:51,083
it's better for your
lungs, your breath.

1375
01:35:53,375 --> 01:35:55,292
You're not going to eat.

1376
01:36:57,167 --> 01:36:58,667
Heyyy !!

1377
01:36:59,292 --> 01:37:00,708
Come on. Be careful.

1378
01:37:00,958 --> 01:37:02,750
I'm sorry.

1379
01:37:02,883 --> 01:37:04,700
- Good morning, sir.
- WHAAAT !!

1380
01:37:04,750 --> 01:37:07,583
It's the person you asked for...

1381
01:37:07,875 --> 01:37:10,333
the cranial massage...Mr Jacquet.

1382
01:37:10,542 --> 01:37:11,667
Good morning.

1383
01:37:12,083 --> 01:37:13,083
Get out!

1384
01:37:13,375 --> 01:37:14,792
Leave me alone.

1385
01:37:15,042 --> 01:37:16,000
Leave!

1386
01:37:16,250 --> 01:37:18,583
- Is it my fault?
- No, non.

1387
01:37:19,083 --> 01:37:21,500
He got up on the wrong
side of the bed.

1388
01:37:23,750 --> 01:37:25,917
"Got up on"... Idiot.

1389
01:37:26,542 --> 01:37:27,750
Moron.

1390
01:37:29,250 --> 01:37:30,333
Driss Vassary?

1391
01:37:30,500 --> 01:37:32,750
- Yes.
- It's your turn.

1392
01:37:47,125 --> 01:37:49,625
I see you've had your
license for a month.

1393
01:37:49,833 --> 01:37:52,083
Yes, but I've been
driving for longer.

1394
01:37:52,333 --> 01:37:55,500
I mean I drove on private roads, alley-ways.

1395
01:37:55,875 --> 01:37:57,667
Parking lots...

1396
01:37:58,208 --> 01:38:00,083
I'm a good driver.

1397
01:38:01,917 --> 01:38:03,833
I read your file.

1398
01:38:04,458 --> 01:38:08,792
In your personal evaluation you
only wrote one word: pragmatic.

1399
01:38:08,917 --> 01:38:10,083
Yes.

1400
01:38:10,667 --> 01:38:11,833
It is important.

1401
01:38:11,843 --> 01:38:16,000
There's another important aspect
to our company, that you forgot to mention.

1402
01:38:16,042 --> 01:38:17,000
Did I?

1403
01:38:18,167 --> 01:38:20,833
Could you just take the time
to read the poster line.

1404
01:38:21,042 --> 01:38:23,083
- That's, Alexandrine rhyme.

1405
01:38:23,333 --> 01:38:24,250
Pardon?

1406
01:38:24,500 --> 01:38:29,042
Could-you-just-take-the-time
To-read-the-pos-ter-line

1407
01:38:29,417 --> 01:38:30,917
12 feet.

1408
01:38:31,333 --> 01:38:34,583
- It wasn't deliberate.
- Your slogan: "Just in time".

1409
01:38:34,917 --> 01:38:37,583
Oh that's why you got
Dali's "Melting Clocks".

1410
01:38:37,875 --> 01:38:39,792
A little artistic touch.

1411
01:38:40,167 --> 01:38:42,042
Maybe, yeah.

1412
01:38:43,292 --> 01:38:46,083
- You like painting?
- Oh, yes.

1413
01:38:46,500 --> 01:38:48,542
- I like Goya.
- It's not bad.

1414
01:38:48,667 --> 01:38:53,333
After Pandi-Panda
he didn't do much.

1415
01:39:00,167 --> 01:39:01,417
Yes.

1416
01:39:03,208 --> 01:39:04,250
I'm coming.

1417
01:39:05,500 --> 01:39:07,333
Right way.

1418
01:39:11,083 --> 01:39:12,958
- Are you ok?
- Yes.

1419
01:39:13,292 --> 01:39:15,167
Piss off !

1420
01:39:15,500 --> 01:39:18,833
Do you need water? A compress?

1421
01:39:20,208 --> 01:39:21,667
Get out.

1422
01:39:22,208 --> 01:39:25,292
- I mean I can...
- Get out !

1423
01:39:32,375 --> 01:39:33,292
There.

1424
01:39:33,500 --> 01:39:35,250
- Thanks, Bruno.
- You're welcome.

1425
01:39:35,458 --> 01:39:38,125
- Have a nice week-end.
- You too. See you monday.

1426
01:39:38,417 --> 01:39:41,625
- What's going on?
- He's not in great shape.

1427
01:39:41,875 --> 01:39:44,167
- Where is he now?
- He was in the garden earlier.

1428
01:39:44,583 --> 01:39:45,792
Ok.

1429
01:39:59,167 --> 01:40:00,333
So...

1430
01:40:00,542 --> 01:40:02,417
What's going on?

1431
01:40:02,708 --> 01:40:05,083
What's with the beard?

1432
01:40:06,208 --> 01:40:07,458
Serpico ?

1433
01:40:07,708 --> 01:40:10,250
Jean Jaurès ? Careful, they'll
name a Metro Station after you.

1434
01:40:10,708 --> 01:40:11,917
Victor Hugo.

1435
01:40:13,083 --> 01:40:15,083
You gotta shave that.
You let yourself go.

1436
01:40:15,375 --> 01:40:16,792
It's about time I came back.

1437
01:40:17,083 --> 01:40:18,792
See ya.

1438
01:41:12,250 --> 01:41:14,000
Now what?

1439
01:41:14,667 --> 01:41:17,417
Just leave it to me.

1440
01:43:01,208 --> 01:43:04,125
Nice, huh?

1441
01:43:25,083 --> 01:43:28,108
One quick slice 
would fix me right up.

1442
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:31,667
You're feeling better !
That's nice !


1443
01:43:35,250 --> 01:43:38,208
<i>I really put my heart into it.</i>
Open your eyes.

1444
01:43:38,417 --> 01:43:39,833
Oh my god.

1445
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:42,000
It's atrocious.

1446
01:43:42,303 --> 01:43:43,083
- No! It looks good.

1447
01:43:43,250 --> 01:43:44,500
No.

1448
01:43:44,708 --> 01:43:45,500
Look...

1449
01:43:45,750 --> 01:43:48,333
leather jacket... sleeveless.

1450
01:43:48,667 --> 01:43:50,375
Gold neck-chain
Village People-cap.

1451
01:43:50,708 --> 01:43:53,042
Oh, I know! José Bové!
...
(enviro-anti-globalist politician)

1452
01:43:53,708 --> 01:43:55,667
You look exactly like him.

1453
01:43:56,042 --> 01:43:58,583
Really creepy.
An orthodox priest or something.

1454
01:43:58,750 --> 01:44:01,375
- A pope.
- Exactly, a pope.

1455
01:44:02,333 --> 01:44:03,708
Come on.

1456
01:44:05,375 --> 01:44:06,792
He's crazy.

1457
01:44:07,083 --> 01:44:09,125
What are you up to?

1458
01:44:10,375 --> 01:44:14,000
- I'm expecting the worst.
- No you'll see.

1459
01:44:16,542 --> 01:44:18,000
I look like my grandfather.

1460
01:44:18,375 --> 01:44:19,292
Really?

1461
01:44:19,583 --> 01:44:24,083
Oh Philippe, you dont know what your
moustache does to me I'm so turned on.

1462
01:44:24,833 --> 01:44:26,583
- Ok, I'll shave it all.
- Thank you.

1463
01:44:26,917 --> 01:44:28,375
Very well.

1464
01:44:29,167 --> 01:44:31,625
No. Please. No.

1465
01:44:32,042 --> 01:44:33,167
No.

1466
01:44:33,542 --> 01:44:34,167
No.

1467
01:44:34,583 --> 01:44:35,708
Nein!

1468
01:44:35,958 --> 01:44:39,458
- Nein is what you mean.
- I'm not ok with that.

1469
01:44:39,875 --> 01:44:42,292
Philippe, angry ? Big angry !

1470
01:44:42,500 --> 01:44:45,417
So I'm your plaything now.

1471
01:44:46,083 --> 01:44:48,292
You're fit to be tied !
You'll end up in an asylum.

1472
01:44:48,542 --> 01:44:50,458
Don't you feel like
invading a few countries?

1473
01:44:50,667 --> 01:44:52,833
Ok, what we need here is...

1474
01:44:53,208 --> 01:44:55,250
one more rasor stroke.

1475
01:44:55,542 --> 01:44:56,833
This makes you laugh? 

1476
01:44:57,167 --> 01:44:59,292
I'm thinking about
quadra-Nazis.

1477
01:44:59,625 --> 01:45:04,250
A bit odd for them
to do the Nazi salute.

1478
01:45:05,208 --> 01:45:08,167
Ok, fine, you had fun.
Take it off !

1479
01:45:10,500 --> 01:45:12,625
Heil.

1480
01:45:19,625 --> 01:45:21,000
- Hello, sir.
- Hello.

1481
01:45:21,292 --> 01:45:23,083
Vassary.
I have a reservation at 1.

1482
01:45:23,292 --> 01:45:26,250
- Yes. Vassary, # 8.
- Follow me.

1483
01:45:31,500 --> 01:45:33,750
- Over here.
- Thank you.

1484
01:45:34,208 --> 01:45:36,083
Thank you, sir.

1485
01:45:54,792 --> 01:45:56,292
So, Philippe.

1486
01:45:56,542 --> 01:45:58,833
I'm not staying for lunch.

1487
01:45:59,917 --> 01:46:02,333
- Why?
- I'm not leaving you alone.

1488
01:46:03,042 --> 01:46:06,375
Just so happens you have a date.

1489
01:46:06,917 --> 01:46:08,125
A date?

1490
01:46:08,458 --> 01:46:09,958
How's that?

1491
01:46:10,792 --> 01:46:12,250
Don't panic. It'll be fine.

1492
01:46:12,625 --> 01:46:13,500
What the...

1493
01:46:13,792 --> 01:46:17,083
Only this time you can't take off.

1494
01:46:18,125 --> 01:46:19,625
By the way...

1495
01:46:21,042 --> 01:46:24,333
It took some time, but I found it.

1496
01:46:24,583 --> 01:46:26,833
Give her a big hug for me.

1497
01:46:27,958 --> 01:46:29,167
Driss.

1498
01:46:30,667 --> 01:46:31,958
Driss.

1499
01:46:34,667 --> 01:46:37,333
What's going on?

1500
01:46:56,917 --> 01:46:59,750
Hello, Philippe.

1501
01:47:38,625 --> 01:47:45,042
Philippe Pozzo Di Borgo now lives in Morocco.
He's married again, and has two daughters.

1502
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:54,583
Abdel Sellou now owns a company.
He's married and has three children.

1503
01:48:12,958 --> 01:48:17,708
Philippe and Abdel
remained close friends.

1
00:00:45,211 --> 00:00:47,589
<i>Historically,
when we look at evolution...</i>

2
00:00:47,756 --> 00:00:50,759
<i>...it's not surprising
that Chappie's left turn happened.</i>

3
00:00:52,802 --> 00:00:57,390
<i>It's too early to tell how
this is all going to play out.</i>

4
00:00:57,557 --> 00:00:59,957
<i>I didn't believe this would happen
in my lifetime, but it is.</i>

5
00:01:05,523 --> 00:01:07,025
<i>Downtown Johannesburg.</i>

6
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:08,526
<i>It's a dangerous city.</i>

7
00:01:08,693 --> 00:01:13,406
<i>Each day, more than 300 murders
and violent attacks take place here.</i>

8
00:01:16,534 --> 00:01:19,704
<i>Two officers have been killed,
three taken to the hospital.</i>

9
00:01:19,871 --> 00:01:23,166
<i>A bloody end to a shoot-out
between cops and robbers.</i>

10
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:25,627
<i>Another man in blue dead.</i>

11
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:31,883
Today, we usher in a new day.

12
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:36,596
<i>- One that represents the end of crime.
- Move in. Lock on target. Fire! Fire!</i>

13
00:01:37,138 --> 00:01:39,099
The end of corruption.

14
00:01:39,849 --> 00:01:42,143
<i>Go! Go! Up against the wall!</i>

15
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:43,853
<i>On the ground.</i>

16
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:46,648
<i>- All targets neutralized.
- And the start...</i>

17
00:01:46,815 --> 00:01:49,609
...of the rebirth of our city!

18
00:01:51,528 --> 00:01:55,365
<i>Welcome to the world's
first robotic police force.</i>

19
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:11,631
<i>Johannesburg, South Africa, became
the focus of the world in 2016...</i>

20
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:15,468
<i>...with the deployment of the planet's
first all-robotic police units.</i>

21
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:20,974
<i>Crime levels plummeted,
and Tetravaal stock skyrocketed.</i>

22
00:02:22,308 --> 00:02:26,354
<i>Certain parts are from China, but all robots
are assembled right here in South Africa.</i>

23
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:30,483
<i>The population's biggest fear
was vulnerability to hacking.</i>

24
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:33,653
<i>Tetravaal assures this is not
something to worry about...</i>

25
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:36,072
<i>...with their bulletproof
Guard Key system.</i>

26
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:40,535
<i>A system which allows only them
to update software on the robots.</i>

27
00:02:41,244 --> 00:02:44,748
<i>Before the success of the ubiquitous
human-sized police robots...</i>

28
00:02:44,914 --> 00:02:48,001
<i>...there was a bigger bad boy
on the block: the Moose.</i>

29
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:51,713
<i>Vincent Moore is a weapons designer
and a former soldier.</i>

30
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:55,175
<i>He has a spiritual issue
with artificial intelligence.</i>

31
00:02:55,342 --> 00:02:57,135
<i>I have a robot that is indestructible.</i>

32
00:02:58,553 --> 00:03:01,639
<i>It is operated
by a thinking, adaptable...</i>

33
00:03:01,806 --> 00:03:04,726
<i>...humane, moral human being.</i>

34
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:07,354
<i>The advanced neural transmitter
converts...</i>

35
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:10,648
<i>...the human operator's thoughts
into the robot's actions.</i>

36
00:03:10,815 --> 00:03:14,110
<i>A departure from the AI
that governs the Scouts.</i>

37
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:17,364
<i>Now with interest from the U.S.,
China and North Korea...</i>

38
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:20,742
<i>...the Scouts' creator, Deon Wilson,
sees a rich future.</i>

39
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:22,952
<i>What really interests me
is high-level AI.</i>

40
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:28,208
<i>True intelligence.
A machine that can think and feel.</i>

41
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:30,627
<i>Is that the mandate at Tetravaal?</i>

42
00:03:30,794 --> 00:03:35,674
<i>To take that evolutionary step forward
and build something truly alive?</i>

43
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:44,182
<i>Scout 22 arriving now
at Maintenance Bay 6.</i>

44
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:46,601
- Team 1, off deck. Go!
- Hurry. Open it up.

45
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:48,978
- Let's get him out.
- Load it up!

46
00:03:49,145 --> 00:03:50,980
- He's pretty banged up.
- Oh, my God.

47
00:03:51,147 --> 00:03:53,024
- Come on!
- Ready to go.

48
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:01,074
Oh, chrissakes.

49
00:04:01,825 --> 00:04:03,868
See this 22? Luck of the draw.

50
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:05,704
They used him as a speed bump.

51
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:08,790
Look at this.
It's like he's cursed or something.

52
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:11,835
Every time he goes out.
Now, yeah, it's his ear.

53
00:04:12,002 --> 00:04:14,087
Antenna, right.
Can we switch this out?

54
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:15,630
Check that circuit again.

55
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:18,800
Terminal on 7 and 7A.

56
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:27,600
<i>Reports of gunfire
in Sections 5, 7 and 8.</i>

57
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:28,768
Okay, fire it up.

58
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:31,980
<i>Police request all available Scouts
to be mobilized.</i>

59
00:04:40,155 --> 00:04:42,073
Destination or task.

60
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,950
Helipad. Yeah?

61
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:50,582
Hey, 22, just watch yourself
this time, eh?

62
00:04:50,749 --> 00:04:52,375
Affirmative.

63
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:05,638
- We're in shit!
- Duh, we in shit, Amerika!

64
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:07,140
I said it was a bad deal.

65
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:09,851
- I said it over and over.
- Everybody, just chill!

66
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:12,937
Yes, we have a problem.
And, yes, I'm gonna solve it!

67
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:16,983
<i>Command, we are searching
for suspects driving a gray vehicle.</i>

68
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:23,907
Hey. They're here!

69
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:36,211
- What's up with this shit?
- Looks pissed.

70
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:41,257
Hippo.

71
00:05:42,634 --> 00:05:44,219
Listen, some shit went down.

72
00:05:44,386 --> 00:05:45,553
Wasn't our fault.

73
00:05:46,429 --> 00:05:47,430
Your weapon.

74
00:05:48,098 --> 00:05:49,724
Fuck's sakes.

75
00:05:49,891 --> 00:05:50,892
And your keys.

76
00:05:52,268 --> 00:05:53,269
Come on.

77
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:54,646
Open the back.

78
00:05:57,649 --> 00:05:59,776
Hey, hey, hey!

79
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:07,992
We're lucky to be alive, Hippo.

80
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:10,620
Ninja.

81
00:06:11,996 --> 00:06:14,541
You know there's no way out of this.

82
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:17,711
There's always a way.
Name your price. We'll sort you out.

83
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:19,671
My price?

84
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:21,172
Is 20 million.

85
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:23,967
- Come on, man. Ridiculous.
- What the fuck?

86
00:06:24,134 --> 00:06:25,677
Fuck I'm gonna pay that back, dude?

87
00:06:25,844 --> 00:06:27,262
Get on your knees.

88
00:06:27,429 --> 00:06:30,765
- Now, get on your fucking knees!
- Okay, okay, okay.

89
00:06:32,308 --> 00:06:34,060
You owe me...

90
00:06:34,602 --> 00:06:36,563
...20 million. Say it.

91
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:38,231
I owe you 20 million.

92
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:44,904
- Pitbull. Pitbull!
- Get back!

93
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:47,032
- Get back!
- Jesus Christ, Hippo.

94
00:06:47,198 --> 00:06:48,783
Seven days.

95
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,702
You've got seven days.

96
00:06:51,161 --> 00:06:53,580
Droids! Droids!

97
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:55,540
You were followed!

98
00:06:57,459 --> 00:07:00,086
- Get behind the wall!
- Yo-Landi, get in the van.

99
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:01,254
- Let's go!
- Get in!

100
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:03,089
Hit the explosives!

101
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,845
- They detonated some explosive.
- Shit! Droids!

102
00:07:09,012 --> 00:07:10,972
Can't get a clear shot.
Touching down.

103
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:12,724
Moving out.

104
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:21,358
- Who took the keys?
- You gave it to that guy!

105
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:23,568
Human officers are on the ground.

106
00:07:23,735 --> 00:07:25,236
Let's go! Let's move!

107
00:07:31,743 --> 00:07:33,203
Move out!

108
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:37,999
Move out, 22. Go, go, go!

109
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:41,252
Drop your weapons.
You are under arrest.

110
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:46,466
Break right! Go, go, go!

111
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:50,970
Come on. Where are the keys?

112
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:52,222
Cue, on my left!

113
00:07:52,389 --> 00:07:55,308
- Kill these cops!
- Move! Get back!

114
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:02,816
Yes, yes.

115
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:04,109
Drop your weapons.

116
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:07,070
Go!

117
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:11,116
Hey, <i>poes!</i>I need my keys, please!

118
00:08:12,075 --> 00:08:13,410
Fuck you!

119
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:18,331
- Drop your weapon. Drop your weapon!
- Fuck you!

120
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,132
Come on.

121
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:30,010
For sure, <i>baas</i>.

122
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:44,691
Shit! They hit the rotor.
We need to touch down.

123
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:49,696
Thank you very much.

124
00:08:50,238 --> 00:08:52,532
Twenty-two, going in.

125
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:15,138
Droid 22 is down, sir.

126
00:09:16,514 --> 00:09:18,099
Bravo 1! We need backup!

127
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:20,435
<i>Copy that. We're sending droids.</i>

128
00:09:21,478 --> 00:09:24,397
- Amerika! Amerika! I've got the keys!
- Your keys.

129
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:26,941
- Hey, Landi, he's got the keys!
- Let's go!

130
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:33,198
Get out of the vehicle.

131
00:09:33,365 --> 00:09:34,491
Go!

132
00:09:37,327 --> 00:09:39,245
Do not run.

133
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:46,002
- Are you okay?
- I'm not okay! I'm hit!

134
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:54,552
<i>Scout 22 is non-responsive.</i>

135
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:56,179
<i>Send an evac team.</i>

136
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:59,432
<i>Yet another victory
for the robotic police force.</i>

137
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:03,311
<i>This marks the 30th large-scale
crime ring smashed this year.</i>

138
00:10:03,812 --> 00:10:05,689
- Good morning, Deon.
- Good morning.

139
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:08,566
People...

140
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:11,069
...if I may have your attention, please.

141
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:13,363
<i>The police chief just called me...</i>

142
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:16,950
<i>...to place an order
for another 100 Scouts.</i>

143
00:10:17,117 --> 00:10:19,202
This is very, very good news.

144
00:10:20,245 --> 00:10:21,287
Way to go!

145
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:23,456
- Deon.
- Nice job!

146
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:25,083
Well done, dude. Well done.

147
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:26,751
- Congrats, D.
- Thank you, man.

148
00:10:26,918 --> 00:10:28,586
- Well done, Deon.
- Great.

149
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:30,922
- Congratulations.
- Thanks. Thank you.

150
00:10:31,089 --> 00:10:32,882
- I appreciate it.
- Nice job, buddy.

151
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:35,552
- I couldn't have done it without you.
- I know.

152
00:10:36,511 --> 00:10:39,472
- Congrats, man. You're awesome.
- Nice job, mate!

153
00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:47,188
Is this the "I feel sorry
for Vincent" call?

154
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:49,482
- Don't worry, Vince.
<i>- Well, I am worried.</i>

155
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:50,692
Well, look...

156
00:10:50,859 --> 00:10:52,986
<i>...we have one more stab
with the police.</i>

157
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:54,904
<i>Try to get those costs down.</i>

158
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:57,157
Try to think positive, okay?

159
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:58,950
- Chin up.
- <i>Kind of hard...</i>

160
00:10:59,117 --> 00:11:03,329
...when you keep cutting my funding.
Twenty percent this year, 25 last year.

161
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:05,540
I've got work to do on the Moose.

162
00:11:05,707 --> 00:11:08,460
The threat detection is still
in its elemental phase.

163
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:12,547
<i>Threat detection is superfluous.
The operator detects the threat.</i>

164
00:11:12,714 --> 00:11:14,341
<i>Then we send the Moose out.</i>

165
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:16,301
Enough already.

166
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:19,262
Cut. Not add.

167
00:11:19,429 --> 00:11:22,223
<i>- Okay?</i>
- Yeah. I'm on it.

168
00:11:22,724 --> 00:11:26,644
<i>- Deon Wilson to the workshop.</i>
- I need to go. I'll talk to you in a bit.

169
00:11:34,986 --> 00:11:36,821
It's my little boy in again, eh?

170
00:11:36,988 --> 00:11:40,241
Fucking surprise, surprise.
Every time. He's a bullet magnet.

171
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:43,870
- What's going on, guys?
- Here's the report. It's 22. Again.

172
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:45,789
RPG, direct to the chest.

173
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:48,333
See a lot of the internals got damaged.

174
00:11:48,917 --> 00:11:52,545
- Brain architecture's still intact.
- Regardless, it's a write-off.

175
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:56,216
- Okay, let's salvage the CPU.
- We could try to cut the battery out.

176
00:11:56,383 --> 00:11:59,719
- It's still charged, still stable.
- No, not worth the effort.

177
00:11:59,886 --> 00:12:03,598
Droid 22 written off. Crush the chassis
and recycle the alloys. Yeah?

178
00:12:03,765 --> 00:12:05,266
- Sure.
- Thank you.

179
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,901
Easy, easy, easy.

180
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:17,278
Come, come, come. Into the lair.

181
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:19,823
- Careful, man.
- We need to stitch his shit up.

182
00:12:30,917 --> 00:12:32,293
You think you got away?

183
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:34,337
No, I didn't think that, Hippo.

184
00:12:34,504 --> 00:12:36,589
You think you don't owe me
this money anymore?

185
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:38,633
<i>Because you think
I'm in prison or what?</i>

186
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:39,968
We'll get your money.

187
00:12:40,135 --> 00:12:42,512
Maybe I come to your secret place
in Soweto.

188
00:12:43,054 --> 00:12:45,306
<i>I come there with the fellows.</i>

189
00:12:45,473 --> 00:12:46,933
I take what I want.

190
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,643
It's cool. One week.

191
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:50,228
Seven days!

192
00:12:54,149 --> 00:12:56,192
- They didn't catch that <i>poes</i>.
- What?

193
00:12:56,359 --> 00:12:57,819
He knows where we live.

194
00:12:57,986 --> 00:13:00,071
We got a week to come up
with his money.

195
00:13:00,238 --> 00:13:03,033
How are we gonna do that?
Come on, that's ridiculous.

196
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:05,702
We need one final job.

197
00:13:05,869 --> 00:13:09,581
I'm talking about serious cash.

198
00:13:09,748 --> 00:13:11,833
Five hundred million rand. Okay?

199
00:13:12,542 --> 00:13:15,211
We pay that animal.
We pocket the rest.

200
00:13:15,378 --> 00:13:18,381
And we get out
while we still can. Boom.

201
00:13:18,548 --> 00:13:20,717
What are you getting on about,
a bank job?

202
00:13:20,884 --> 00:13:22,052
No.

203
00:13:22,552 --> 00:13:24,012
- Cash in transit.
- What?

204
00:13:24,179 --> 00:13:26,056
- That's what?
- A heist, Yo-Landi.

205
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:28,808
The droids are gonna come down
on our asses, okay?

206
00:13:28,975 --> 00:13:30,769
- They'll hit us harder.
- It's true.

207
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:33,521
Guys, we need, like, a remote.

208
00:13:33,688 --> 00:13:35,982
- Like a switch.
- What? Excuse me?

209
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:40,070
Okay, the robots are
like machines, right?

210
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:41,321
Like a TV.

211
00:13:41,488 --> 00:13:44,532
So if we had a remote
to switch it off....

212
00:13:44,699 --> 00:13:46,034
That's brilliant.

213
00:13:46,201 --> 00:13:51,414
We need to find the guy who makes
the robots and steal his remotes.

214
00:14:01,299 --> 00:14:02,300
Dexter?

215
00:14:02,467 --> 00:14:05,136
Hello, Deon. Welcome home.

216
00:14:05,804 --> 00:14:08,181
- Have you been a good boy today?
- Yes, Deon.

217
00:14:08,348 --> 00:14:11,810
- Yeah? Did you clean my room?
- Your room has been sterilized.

218
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:13,395
Nice.

219
00:14:13,812 --> 00:14:17,899
Are you working on your artificial
intelligence program tonight?

220
00:14:18,066 --> 00:14:20,527
- Yes.
- I will activate the kettle.

221
00:14:24,739 --> 00:14:26,074
<i>Okay.</i>

222
00:14:26,241 --> 00:14:27,409
<i>Hello again.</i>

223
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:30,412
<i>So it's day 944.</i>

224
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:32,497
<i>I'm extremely close now.</i>

225
00:14:32,664 --> 00:14:35,291
<i>There's always chance of error,
I'm aware of this.</i>

226
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:39,254
<i>But statistically speaking,
I think I might be on track.</i>

227
00:14:39,421 --> 00:14:42,424
<i>I have several terabytes
of compiling and coding to do...</i>

228
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:44,342
<i>...and then we shall see.</i>

229
00:14:44,509 --> 00:14:46,511
<i>All right? See you in a bit.</i>

230
00:14:52,642 --> 00:14:54,769
- Look. That's the motherfucker.
- Him?

231
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:59,190
Dude, it's gonna be so easy.

232
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:02,569
We need those remotes, my man.

233
00:15:03,111 --> 00:15:05,238
We need those remotes.

234
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:08,742
Red Bull!

235
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:10,243
Yes, Deon.

236
00:15:11,202 --> 00:15:12,662
Red Bull.

237
00:15:17,459 --> 00:15:18,793
Okay.

238
00:15:39,522 --> 00:15:40,899
Come on.

239
00:15:43,234 --> 00:15:44,861
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

240
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:47,238
What if you change the...?

241
00:16:14,182 --> 00:16:16,726
- It's stable.
- Is everything okay?

242
00:16:19,896 --> 00:16:21,022
It's stable.

243
00:16:22,273 --> 00:16:23,608
<i>My God.</i>

244
00:16:23,775 --> 00:16:25,318
<i>I think I've cracked it.</i>

245
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:28,988
<i>Of course, to really know,
I must test it on a live system.</i>

246
00:16:29,906 --> 00:16:31,491
<i>I must test it.</i>

247
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:41,584
All right.

248
00:16:42,669 --> 00:16:44,462
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

249
00:16:46,631 --> 00:16:48,675
Hey. Hey!

250
00:16:48,842 --> 00:16:51,219
- Hey. Where's the Scout?
- How's it, sir? What?

251
00:16:51,386 --> 00:16:55,473
- The Scout, man, 22 for demolition.
- Guys are prepping the compactor.

252
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,767
- It goes in soon.
- Oh, thank God.

253
00:16:59,102 --> 00:17:01,438
- Don't destroy it yet, okay?
- <i>Ja</i>, sure.

254
00:17:01,604 --> 00:17:04,107
Just wait for me,
but don't destroy it, okay?

255
00:17:05,775 --> 00:17:08,820
- Hello, ma'am.
- Morning, Deon.

256
00:17:09,571 --> 00:17:11,489
All right. Let's have it.

257
00:17:11,656 --> 00:17:15,577
- What are you proposing now?
- Ma'am, I think I've cracked it.

258
00:17:15,744 --> 00:17:19,205
The world's first proper,
full artificial intelligence.

259
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:22,625
This is a computer system
that might be smarter than a human.

260
00:17:22,792 --> 00:17:24,711
I could show it a piece of art...

261
00:17:24,878 --> 00:17:28,757
...and this thing, this being,
could judge that art.

262
00:17:28,923 --> 00:17:32,260
It could decide if it liked it.

263
00:17:32,427 --> 00:17:34,846
It could write music and poetry.

264
00:17:35,013 --> 00:17:36,514
Okay. Stop.

265
00:17:36,681 --> 00:17:38,141
Please, Deon.

266
00:17:38,725 --> 00:17:40,602
Do you realize you just came...

267
00:17:40,769 --> 00:17:43,897
...to the CEO of a publicly traded
weapons corporation...

268
00:17:44,064 --> 00:17:46,900
...and pitched a robot
that can write poems?

269
00:17:47,067 --> 00:17:49,152
Well, if you just let me explain...

270
00:17:49,319 --> 00:17:53,031
Deon, Tetravaal is very happy
with you.

271
00:17:53,198 --> 00:17:55,325
The Scouts are a huge success.

272
00:17:55,492 --> 00:17:58,328
Ma'am, look,
it won't cost you anything.

273
00:17:58,495 --> 00:18:02,040
A droid downstairs was written off
yesterday, smashed beyond repair.

274
00:18:02,207 --> 00:18:04,292
Let me install this on it.

275
00:18:04,459 --> 00:18:07,671
- Please just let me test it.
- No. No, I'm sorry, Deon.

276
00:18:07,837 --> 00:18:10,173
You know
how insurance works for those...

277
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:12,801
...all the red tape and the paperwork.

278
00:18:12,967 --> 00:18:14,844
Thank you for your time.

279
00:18:23,144 --> 00:18:27,440
<i>All new employees, please report
to Human Resources for orientation.</i>

280
00:18:32,237 --> 00:18:33,530
Shit.

281
00:18:34,656 --> 00:18:35,657
Hey, Bill.

282
00:18:55,218 --> 00:18:56,970
<i>Attention. Attention.</i>

283
00:18:57,137 --> 00:19:00,640
<i>Remember to have your security pass
visible at all times.</i>

284
00:19:02,058 --> 00:19:04,686
Hey. Can you give me
a hand over here?

285
00:19:34,341 --> 00:19:35,967
Come on. Come on.

286
00:19:38,636 --> 00:19:39,721
Come on.

287
00:19:47,562 --> 00:19:48,813
Thank you.

288
00:19:53,193 --> 00:19:55,362
Yep. Showtime.

289
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:11,086
- What's up, homes?
- Hey. Hey, hey, hey!

290
00:20:13,797 --> 00:20:16,049
Please! Hey, what is it?

291
00:20:16,216 --> 00:20:18,593
This is you getting hijacked, my friend.

292
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,011
Welcome to Joburg.

293
00:20:23,306 --> 00:20:26,810
And these are all part
of what makes the Moose unique...

294
00:20:26,976 --> 00:20:29,270
...and perfect for you
at the department.

295
00:20:29,437 --> 00:20:32,565
The strategic ability to neutralize
the enemy's targets.

296
00:20:32,732 --> 00:20:35,527
High-value targets:
radar installations...

297
00:20:35,694 --> 00:20:37,821
...aircraft, fuel storage locations.

298
00:20:37,987 --> 00:20:39,906
- Aircraft?
- Yes, sir.

299
00:20:41,366 --> 00:20:43,535
We're taking out an enemy's aircraft?

300
00:20:43,702 --> 00:20:45,829
We are talking
about urban crimes here?

301
00:20:45,995 --> 00:20:48,873
You know, muggings,
carjackings, loitering.

302
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:51,710
I'm talking all kinds of targets, sir.
Low to high.

303
00:20:51,876 --> 00:20:54,129
I do believe you need
a weapons platform...

304
00:20:54,295 --> 00:20:57,757
...that can fire warheads
with precision and reliability.

305
00:20:57,924 --> 00:21:01,636
And might I add, sir, all under
the control of a human operator.

306
00:21:02,429 --> 00:21:03,596
Look, Miss Bradley...

307
00:21:03,763 --> 00:21:07,726
...the police force is very happy
with the Scouts. Very, very happy.

308
00:21:07,892 --> 00:21:10,270
- We just ordered new droids.
- Thank you.

309
00:21:10,437 --> 00:21:13,064
We've been very successful
at bringing down crime.

310
00:21:13,231 --> 00:21:15,316
But this? No, we don't want this.

311
00:21:15,483 --> 00:21:19,779
I mean, look at it. It's overkill.
It's expensive, it's big, and it's ugly.

312
00:21:19,946 --> 00:21:24,075
It'll have to get a hell of a lot worse
for us to even consider this.

313
00:21:24,993 --> 00:21:26,578
A hell of a lot worse.

314
00:21:26,745 --> 00:21:28,663
No, I think we're done here.

315
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:31,708
Well, thank you,
Commissioner Steenkamp.

316
00:21:31,875 --> 00:21:33,960
We'll get you those Scouts.

317
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:58,485
Wakey, wakey.

318
00:22:01,863 --> 00:22:04,366
Please.
Please, I don't have much money.

319
00:22:04,532 --> 00:22:06,368
Shut up. I don't want your money.

320
00:22:06,534 --> 00:22:10,205
- We know who you are, my friend.
- We know you make the robots.

321
00:22:10,372 --> 00:22:12,123
No, there must be a mistake.

322
00:22:12,290 --> 00:22:13,500
I mean....

323
00:22:14,918 --> 00:22:16,670
Stop playing dumb with us!

324
00:22:17,379 --> 00:22:21,257
We know you have some kind of TV
remote thing to switch those robots off.

325
00:22:21,424 --> 00:22:23,718
- Excuse me?
- It's a machine.

326
00:22:23,885 --> 00:22:25,261
It's got an on-off switch.

327
00:22:25,428 --> 00:22:28,056
- Maybe there's one in the van.
- <i>Ja,</i>check the van.

328
00:22:28,223 --> 00:22:30,725
- Cut his feet off.
- That's a good idea, Amerika.

329
00:22:30,892 --> 00:22:34,270
- No, no, no! No, please! Help!
- Yo, man, that's a good idea.

330
00:22:34,437 --> 00:22:37,357
You can get yourself
a nice, funky wheelchair.

331
00:22:37,524 --> 00:22:39,984
No, please listen.
You cannot switch them off.

332
00:22:40,151 --> 00:22:41,486
Bullshit! It's a machine.

333
00:22:41,653 --> 00:22:43,988
They have a firmware lock.
They're always on.

334
00:22:44,155 --> 00:22:45,365
Just shoot him, man.

335
00:22:45,532 --> 00:22:47,701
Please! Please, don't! No!

336
00:22:49,828 --> 00:22:51,705
Y'all gotta see this.

337
00:22:55,583 --> 00:22:57,669
Jesus Christ.

338
00:22:57,836 --> 00:22:59,629
He managed to turn this one off.

339
00:22:59,796 --> 00:23:03,967
There's legs and shit all over the place.
Was he gonna build it or something?

340
00:23:04,551 --> 00:23:05,927
You know what?

341
00:23:06,094 --> 00:23:09,848
What if we get him to program
this bad boy to fight for us?

342
00:23:10,015 --> 00:23:13,685
Like an indestructible robot gangsta,
number one, son.

343
00:23:14,352 --> 00:23:15,645
Hey.

344
00:23:15,812 --> 00:23:18,565
Listen, my friend,
we know about your little buddy...

345
00:23:18,732 --> 00:23:20,650
...you're trying to hide from us.

346
00:23:20,817 --> 00:23:22,694
I wasn't hiding anything.

347
00:23:22,861 --> 00:23:26,072
Either you reprogram that robot
in the van to work for us...

348
00:23:26,239 --> 00:23:28,199
...or we fucking shoot you right now.

349
00:23:28,366 --> 00:23:30,368
What do you mean, "reprogram him"?

350
00:23:30,535 --> 00:23:33,204
- Don't play dumb!
- You know exactly what we mean.

351
00:23:33,371 --> 00:23:36,207
Turn that robot
into the illest gangsta on the block.

352
00:23:36,374 --> 00:23:39,502
We use him to make some moves
and make some real money.

353
00:23:40,879 --> 00:23:43,214
The one in my van is a test.

354
00:23:44,591 --> 00:23:47,260
It's never been tried,
but if it works, you can...

355
00:23:47,427 --> 00:23:49,304
...train him to do what you want.

356
00:23:49,471 --> 00:23:51,222
What do you mean, "if it works"?

357
00:23:51,389 --> 00:23:53,308
It's a new project I'm working on.

358
00:23:53,475 --> 00:23:55,894
It makes the robot have a mind
like a human.

359
00:23:56,061 --> 00:23:58,229
But it's like a child in the beginning.

360
00:23:58,396 --> 00:24:00,065
Like a human baby, but smarter.

361
00:24:00,607 --> 00:24:04,027
Its AI can learn much faster
than any organic intelligence.

362
00:24:04,194 --> 00:24:06,613
- But it has to be taught.
- Well, for how long?

363
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:08,740
- I don't know! It's untested.
- Enough.

364
00:24:08,907 --> 00:24:11,785
This is your only option!
I'm telling you:

365
00:24:11,951 --> 00:24:15,163
You cannot switch them off
and you cannot hack the others.

366
00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:17,415
Please, I don't wanna die.

367
00:24:29,844 --> 00:24:33,890
It's just plug and play. Quick release.
Snap on and snap off.

368
00:24:35,183 --> 00:24:38,311
- Why is all its legs off?
- It was scheduled for destruction.

369
00:24:38,478 --> 00:24:41,147
- Why?
- Because it's damaged.

370
00:24:41,314 --> 00:24:43,274
The battery's fused with the chassis.

371
00:24:43,441 --> 00:24:44,567
What?

372
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:48,738
- It means you can't change the battery.
- How long will it last?

373
00:24:48,905 --> 00:24:50,281
- Shit.
- Oh, shit.

374
00:24:50,448 --> 00:24:52,826
About five days, until the battery dies.

375
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:56,371
- This thing will only run for five days?
- Roughly, yes.

376
00:25:06,589 --> 00:25:07,590
What is that?

377
00:25:07,757 --> 00:25:10,552
A Guard Key.
You need it to install new software.

378
00:25:15,515 --> 00:25:17,225
Come on, man.

379
00:25:22,313 --> 00:25:24,149
Remember I said it has to learn?

380
00:25:24,315 --> 00:25:26,735
I have to come back
and help to teach it.

381
00:25:26,901 --> 00:25:28,611
Otherwise, this is pointless.

382
00:25:28,778 --> 00:25:30,905
Fine. Just switch it on.

383
00:25:32,157 --> 00:25:35,910
Switch the thing on now, my friend.

384
00:25:37,203 --> 00:25:38,830
Now!

385
00:25:57,390 --> 00:25:58,683
Oh, shit.

386
00:25:58,850 --> 00:26:00,935
Give it space. Give it space.

387
00:26:01,102 --> 00:26:02,729
It's okay. Give it space.

388
00:26:02,896 --> 00:26:05,065
Please, please, please.
Put the gun down.

389
00:26:06,566 --> 00:26:07,942
Dude.

390
00:26:08,109 --> 00:26:09,319
Come on.

391
00:26:09,486 --> 00:26:10,653
Hey.

392
00:26:11,529 --> 00:26:13,198
Hey. Come on out.

393
00:26:13,365 --> 00:26:15,950
Hey, come here.
Come here, little buddy.

394
00:26:16,117 --> 00:26:17,702
Come here. Come here.

395
00:26:17,869 --> 00:26:19,037
Come out.

396
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:22,165
Come... Get the fuck out!

397
00:26:22,332 --> 00:26:25,960
Please! It doesn't understand English yet.
It doesn't understand you.

398
00:26:26,127 --> 00:26:27,879
You gave me a retarded robot?

399
00:26:28,046 --> 00:26:29,756
You're scaring it.

400
00:26:30,757 --> 00:26:32,801
Just go in the kitchen.

401
00:26:33,885 --> 00:26:37,097
Ninjie-kun, just go in the kitchen.
I've got this.

402
00:26:37,263 --> 00:26:40,934
I'll get it. Just go get a beer
or something.

403
00:26:42,143 --> 00:26:43,937
<i>Hey. Come on.</i>

404
00:26:45,563 --> 00:26:46,898
<i>Come on.</i>

405
00:26:47,065 --> 00:26:49,067
<i>Can he not understand me?</i>

406
00:26:49,901 --> 00:26:51,111
<i>It worked.</i>

407
00:26:51,277 --> 00:26:52,779
Yo, computer boy.

408
00:26:53,613 --> 00:26:56,199
Can he understand me when I speak?

409
00:26:56,366 --> 00:26:57,867
No. No, not yet.

410
00:26:58,785 --> 00:26:59,994
Soon.

411
00:27:00,995 --> 00:27:03,039
Hey. It's okay.

412
00:27:03,623 --> 00:27:05,333
- Come.
- Come out.

413
00:27:06,042 --> 00:27:07,711
<i>- Come out.
- That's it.</i>

414
00:27:07,877 --> 00:27:09,587
<i>- Here we go. Come.
- Come on.</i>

415
00:27:09,754 --> 00:27:11,840
<i>Come. No one's gonna hurt you.</i>

416
00:27:12,007 --> 00:27:13,550
See? That's it.

417
00:27:13,717 --> 00:27:14,968
Come.

418
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:16,928
Come.

419
00:27:17,095 --> 00:27:18,430
That's good.

420
00:27:18,596 --> 00:27:20,140
That's good. Come.

421
00:27:20,306 --> 00:27:22,684
I know you don't understand,
but it's okay.

422
00:27:22,851 --> 00:27:25,520
Come. Here we go.

423
00:27:27,439 --> 00:27:30,817
- It's okay.
- It's some crazy shit, eh?

424
00:27:36,364 --> 00:27:37,365
<i>You want that?</i>

425
00:27:38,783 --> 00:27:40,118
You like that?

426
00:27:46,624 --> 00:27:48,168
He's so cute.

427
00:27:48,335 --> 00:27:50,503
Like a baby, eh?

428
00:27:52,172 --> 00:27:53,214
<i>That's a watch.</i>

429
00:27:53,381 --> 00:27:54,674
<i>That's a watch.</i>

430
00:28:01,806 --> 00:28:03,224
<i>Watch.</i>

431
00:28:05,435 --> 00:28:06,478
Watch.

432
00:28:09,564 --> 00:28:11,358
- That's amazing.
- Watch.

433
00:28:11,524 --> 00:28:12,901
Wait, wait, wait.

434
00:28:13,068 --> 00:28:14,986
I'm just gonna get one more thing.

435
00:28:22,494 --> 00:28:23,578
It's good.

436
00:28:24,204 --> 00:28:25,872
- Hey.
- It's okay.

437
00:28:26,373 --> 00:28:27,582
Hey.

438
00:28:30,335 --> 00:28:32,837
What's this? Hey, look at this.

439
00:28:34,881 --> 00:28:36,341
Look at this. Listen.

440
00:28:37,717 --> 00:28:38,843
Hey.

441
00:28:40,970 --> 00:28:42,472
That's a chicken.

442
00:28:43,682 --> 00:28:44,974
<i>Yeah.</i>

443
00:28:46,309 --> 00:28:47,602
<i>Chicken.</i>

444
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:51,981
Chicken.

445
00:28:57,529 --> 00:28:59,447
Yo-lan-di.

446
00:29:00,615 --> 00:29:02,575
Yo-lan-di.

447
00:29:02,742 --> 00:29:04,786
<i>Ja, </i>good.

448
00:29:07,372 --> 00:29:08,623
Deon.

449
00:29:09,749 --> 00:29:11,001
Deon.

450
00:29:13,128 --> 00:29:14,379
You look so happy.

451
00:29:15,255 --> 00:29:17,298
Like a little happy chappie.

452
00:29:18,258 --> 00:29:21,511
That's it. That's your name. "Chappie."

453
00:29:22,595 --> 00:29:25,473
No. No, no, no. No, his name is not...

454
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:28,059
- Chappie.
- <i>Ja,</i>I like that.

455
00:29:28,226 --> 00:29:30,687
- That's good. I like that. Chappie.
- Okay.

456
00:29:30,854 --> 00:29:32,814
- Chicken.
- Chicken. Yeah.

457
00:29:33,690 --> 00:29:36,067
What the fuck is this?

458
00:29:36,234 --> 00:29:38,111
We're just orienting it.

459
00:29:38,278 --> 00:29:39,404
Chicken.

460
00:29:39,571 --> 00:29:40,822
- Come here!
- No, no, no.

461
00:29:40,989 --> 00:29:43,908
Wait! Wait! I need to get
the Guard Key out of his head.

462
00:29:45,785 --> 00:29:49,330
- I'll orient you if I ever see you again.
- He's mine! He's special.

463
00:29:49,497 --> 00:29:52,667
I don't want any confrontation, okay?
I'll see him tomorrow.

464
00:29:52,834 --> 00:29:55,420
You made an agreement.
Let him train the robot.

465
00:29:55,587 --> 00:29:58,173
Let me come and see him
like we agreed. Please.

466
00:29:58,715 --> 00:30:00,300
Okay, okay. I'm coming back.

467
00:30:00,467 --> 00:30:02,177
Chappie, I'll be back!

468
00:30:46,763 --> 00:30:48,098
Where are you?

469
00:30:49,391 --> 00:30:50,767
Where'd you go?

470
00:30:53,812 --> 00:30:55,855
What the hell are you up to, Deon?

471
00:31:10,912 --> 00:31:12,580
What the hell is this? Open.

472
00:31:15,291 --> 00:31:18,461
"Scout 22, Guard Key installed."

473
00:32:23,485 --> 00:32:24,652
<i>He-Man!</i>

474
00:32:24,819 --> 00:32:27,906
<i>And the Masters of the Universe!</i>

475
00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:30,075
<i>I am Adam...</i>

476
00:32:30,241 --> 00:32:34,412
<i>...prince of Eternia and defender
of the secrets of Castle Grayskull.</i>

477
00:32:34,579 --> 00:32:36,331
<i>This is Cringer...</i>

478
00:32:36,498 --> 00:32:38,166
<i>...my fearless friend.</i>

479
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:41,169
<i>Fabulous secret powers
were revealed to me...</i>

480
00:32:41,336 --> 00:32:44,172
<i>...the day I held aloft
my magic sword and said:</i>

481
00:32:44,339 --> 00:32:46,925
<i>By the power of Grayskull!</i>

482
00:32:48,134 --> 00:32:49,678
<i>He-Man!</i>

483
00:32:49,844 --> 00:32:53,640
<i>I have the power!</i>

484
00:32:57,811 --> 00:32:59,729
Oh, so you watch cartoons?

485
00:33:02,148 --> 00:33:03,400
No, no, no, my friend.

486
00:33:04,109 --> 00:33:06,986
You stay under this roof,
you make money for me.

487
00:33:07,153 --> 00:33:09,656
The first thing you do
is you get your gun.

488
00:33:09,823 --> 00:33:12,659
Then you cock your gun.
Now it's ready to shoot, <i>nè?</i>

489
00:33:12,826 --> 00:33:14,327
Now you choose your target.

490
00:33:14,494 --> 00:33:17,288
I wanna shoot that blue bottle,
there in the front.

491
00:33:17,455 --> 00:33:18,957
Have a look. Nice and easy.

492
00:33:19,124 --> 00:33:23,378
So I aim at the blue bottle, like,
there it is. I'm like, "Okay, and..."

493
00:33:24,421 --> 00:33:28,675
Now I'm gonna shoot the green bottle.
Okay, look, I aim and pow! See?

494
00:33:28,842 --> 00:33:30,885
Now I'm gonna shoot the yellow one.

495
00:33:31,052 --> 00:33:32,178
See, it's easy.

496
00:33:32,345 --> 00:33:34,514
Just aim the gun, and...

497
00:33:37,559 --> 00:33:39,352
Come here. Come, come, come.

498
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:43,398
Come here. Come here. Stand here.
Now, listen, take the gun.

499
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:46,443
Hold the gun proper...
Just straighten your arm.

500
00:33:46,609 --> 00:33:48,903
Just hold the fucking gun properly,
Chappie.

501
00:33:49,654 --> 00:33:51,489
Jesus Christ. Okay.

502
00:33:51,656 --> 00:33:54,117
One, two, three.

503
00:33:56,703 --> 00:33:58,663
Jesus, my bag.

504
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:02,334
Don't drop my gun, Chappie!

505
00:34:02,751 --> 00:34:05,170
You fucked up my sight.
This shit's expensive.

506
00:34:05,337 --> 00:34:08,089
- What are you doing?
- Teaching him to shoot.

507
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:10,633
You shouldn't be doing this shit
with him yet.

508
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:13,261
Deon said he has to be orientated first.

509
00:34:13,428 --> 00:34:16,681
Okay, you know what? I'm gonna go
and get the weed on my own.

510
00:34:16,848 --> 00:34:19,100
Without the stupid fucking robot.

511
00:34:19,267 --> 00:34:21,102
And I'm gonna make all the money...

512
00:34:21,269 --> 00:34:23,813
...so we can buy the explosives
to do this heist.

513
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:26,107
Or else we're fucking dead.

514
00:34:26,274 --> 00:34:28,568
He's not stupid. He's just a kid.

515
00:34:28,735 --> 00:34:31,780
Go do your nails
and play with your titanium baby!

516
00:34:46,086 --> 00:34:47,796
You having a baby, man?

517
00:34:49,255 --> 00:34:53,093
Still a baby yourself, aren't you?
Whoa, hey. What happened, man?

518
00:34:53,259 --> 00:34:56,388
Jeez. You got a little bit rowdy
at the bar with your mates?

519
00:34:56,554 --> 00:35:00,225
If you ever wanna come out with me,
go hit the heavy bag at the gym...

520
00:35:00,392 --> 00:35:02,727
...we could nut out a few great moves.

521
00:35:02,894 --> 00:35:04,688
- I'll show you how to scrap.
- Yeah.

522
00:35:04,854 --> 00:35:07,565
Always gotta be ready.
You know what I'm saying?

523
00:35:07,732 --> 00:35:10,610
- Want in?
- Thanks for the offer, but I'm good.

524
00:35:10,777 --> 00:35:12,904
No worries. Well, anytime.

525
00:35:13,071 --> 00:35:15,907
It's real cool, man. It's really cool.

526
00:35:16,074 --> 00:35:18,159
Hey, listen, bit of a favor.

527
00:35:18,326 --> 00:35:20,328
Just wanted to borrow the Guard Key...

528
00:35:20,495 --> 00:35:23,331
...so I can check Scout security levels
with my design.

529
00:35:23,498 --> 00:35:27,085
I just wanna make sure that the Moose
is as secure as the Scouts.

530
00:35:27,252 --> 00:35:28,503
- Borrow it?
- Yeah.

531
00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:31,256
Michelle asked me
to check on the security, so....

532
00:35:31,423 --> 00:35:33,133
Yeah, just an hour or something.

533
00:35:35,093 --> 00:35:37,262
Vincent,
you know I can't do that, right?

534
00:35:37,429 --> 00:35:40,974
- There are clear rules about that.
- Blah-blah-blah.

535
00:35:41,141 --> 00:35:42,684
Mate, don't be such a wowser.

536
00:35:42,851 --> 00:35:45,729
One engineer to another,
asking for the Guard Key.

537
00:35:45,895 --> 00:35:48,314
- "Engineer"? Weren't you a soldier?
- Yeah.

538
00:35:48,481 --> 00:35:50,984
- Look, I'm only joking.
- That's funny. Yeah.

539
00:35:51,151 --> 00:35:53,028
You'd have to tell the Board of...

540
00:35:53,194 --> 00:35:56,614
I spent two years at DARPA,
you whacker.

541
00:35:56,781 --> 00:36:00,493
And, yeah, I was SASR,
you little stickybeak.

542
00:36:02,412 --> 00:36:05,373
You're making me as cross
as a frog in a sock, mate.

543
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:07,876
Your robots have drained
all my funding.

544
00:36:08,043 --> 00:36:10,170
You're a big problem for me,
you get me?

545
00:36:10,337 --> 00:36:13,798
So I'm gonna start asking you slowly,
you dipstick.

546
00:36:13,965 --> 00:36:19,012
Give me the Guard Key.

547
00:36:19,763 --> 00:36:21,097
No.

548
00:36:25,727 --> 00:36:27,520
Just taking a piss, man.

549
00:36:27,687 --> 00:36:29,481
Just taking a piss.

550
00:36:29,647 --> 00:36:31,358
Come on, man, look. Empty.

551
00:36:31,524 --> 00:36:33,485
As if I'd carry live rounds here.

552
00:36:33,651 --> 00:36:37,072
It's a prank. Everyone go back
to work, man. Come on.

553
00:36:37,989 --> 00:36:39,616
Oh, by the way. Church.

554
00:36:39,783 --> 00:36:42,243
Any Sunday, mate, you're welcome.
Come with me.

555
00:36:42,410 --> 00:36:43,995
To all of you. All welcome.

556
00:36:45,246 --> 00:36:47,123
It's just a prank, man.

557
00:36:48,458 --> 00:36:50,585
This office has gotta lighten up.

558
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:20,240
Where are you going, mate?
Where are you going?

559
00:37:24,577 --> 00:37:26,287
Shoe.

560
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:29,874
Say "shoe."

561
00:37:30,041 --> 00:37:31,835
It's for your foot, bro.

562
00:37:32,002 --> 00:37:35,714
Wait, wait. Chappie, look.
Look. Look.

563
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:37,549
"Rat." It's okay.

564
00:37:37,716 --> 00:37:40,135
No, he's stupid.
He can't talk. We're screwed.

565
00:37:40,301 --> 00:37:42,804
No, he can talk. He's smart.

566
00:37:42,971 --> 00:37:45,181
No, he can talk. He's smart.

567
00:37:45,348 --> 00:37:49,102
- Oh, my God. Look, he's copying me!
- Oh, my God. Look, he's copying me!

568
00:37:49,269 --> 00:37:52,731
- Chappie! Chappie, say "shoe."
- Shoe.

569
00:37:52,897 --> 00:37:55,233
- Say "rat."
- Rat.

570
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:57,235
Say "Mommy."

571
00:37:57,402 --> 00:37:59,404
Say Mommy.

572
00:38:00,488 --> 00:38:01,698
Chappie.

573
00:38:01,865 --> 00:38:02,991
- Shoe.
- Shoe.

574
00:38:03,158 --> 00:38:04,200
- Rat.
- Rat.

575
00:38:04,367 --> 00:38:05,869
- Mommy.
- Mommy.

576
00:38:06,036 --> 00:38:07,203
- Amerika.
- Homes.

577
00:38:07,370 --> 00:38:08,830
Amerika homes.

578
00:38:08,997 --> 00:38:10,165
Amerika homes.

579
00:38:10,331 --> 00:38:11,916
- Good, Chappie.
- Oh, shit.

580
00:38:12,083 --> 00:38:14,294
That homes is a clever little robot.

581
00:38:14,461 --> 00:38:17,297
That homes is a clever little robot
right there.

582
00:38:18,256 --> 00:38:21,926
- This motherfucker talks ghetto.
- This fuck mother talks ghetto.

583
00:38:22,093 --> 00:38:25,555
All right, you the rudest bad boy
in Joburg.

584
00:38:26,222 --> 00:38:28,058
Chappie be the rudest bad boy...

585
00:38:28,224 --> 00:38:30,977
...streetwise professor in Joburg,
fuck mother!

586
00:38:31,144 --> 00:38:34,105
- Yes! Yes! It's gonna work, man.
- Yes! Yes! Fuck mother!

587
00:38:34,272 --> 00:38:36,483
- He's so smart!
- I can work with this.

588
00:38:36,649 --> 00:38:38,610
All right, let's pound it out.

589
00:38:38,777 --> 00:38:40,028
Like this.

590
00:38:40,195 --> 00:38:41,404
Go bloop!

591
00:38:41,571 --> 00:38:44,032
Boom, Chappie, go boom.

592
00:38:44,199 --> 00:38:45,241
Bloop!

593
00:38:54,376 --> 00:38:57,087
You hear that? Somebody's here.

594
00:39:00,173 --> 00:39:02,258
- Who's here, Mommy?
- I don't know.

595
00:39:06,262 --> 00:39:07,430
Hello?

596
00:39:12,310 --> 00:39:13,561
It's the nerd.

597
00:39:13,728 --> 00:39:16,147
What? No.

598
00:39:17,023 --> 00:39:18,024
Hello.

599
00:39:18,191 --> 00:39:20,985
- You shouldn't be here. Go.
- I'm here to see my...

600
00:39:21,152 --> 00:39:24,322
No. He's coming back soon.
You're lucky to be alive.

601
00:39:42,549 --> 00:39:45,552
- I'm just gonna say hello, if...
- What is that stuff?

602
00:39:45,719 --> 00:39:48,722
I'm here to teach him.
Like we agreed. Yeah?

603
00:39:48,888 --> 00:39:51,725
You're gonna catch a bullet
hanging around here, nerd.

604
00:39:54,811 --> 00:39:56,813
Hello, my little one.

605
00:39:56,980 --> 00:39:58,356
Hello.

606
00:39:59,190 --> 00:40:00,775
Have we learnt this word yet?

607
00:40:02,944 --> 00:40:04,779
Hey.

608
00:40:05,321 --> 00:40:06,740
What's up, fuck mother?

609
00:40:08,575 --> 00:40:10,118
How's shit?

610
00:40:11,578 --> 00:40:13,038
Where did you learn that?

611
00:40:13,204 --> 00:40:14,622
- These guys?
- Hey, hey, hey.

612
00:40:14,789 --> 00:40:17,459
Watch your mouth.
Before you get yourself shanked.

613
00:40:17,625 --> 00:40:20,712
Better watch your mouth.
You're gonna get yourself shanked.

614
00:40:20,879 --> 00:40:23,840
Chappie, please, have respect for me.
I'm your maker.

615
00:40:24,007 --> 00:40:26,551
Please. If I could just have
a moment with him.

616
00:40:26,718 --> 00:40:27,761
Excuse me?

617
00:40:27,927 --> 00:40:31,973
You know, surely you can go and count
your narcotics in another room.

618
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:35,352
You come in here, tell me where to go,
where to do my work?

619
00:40:35,518 --> 00:40:37,687
- I don't mean to impose.
- Shut your mouth.

620
00:40:37,854 --> 00:40:40,023
- I'll cut your tongue out.
- I'm sorry.

621
00:40:40,190 --> 00:40:42,233
Okay, Amerika, Amerika, Amerika.

622
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,611
Don't count drugs in front of the kid.

623
00:40:44,778 --> 00:40:46,529
I gotta get this shit done.

624
00:40:46,696 --> 00:40:49,032
By the time I finish,
you'd better be gone.

625
00:40:49,199 --> 00:40:50,241
Okay. Absolutely.

626
00:40:51,034 --> 00:40:52,327
Chappie.

627
00:40:53,244 --> 00:40:55,372
Listen to me, I'm your maker.

628
00:40:55,538 --> 00:40:57,916
I brought you into this world, okay?

629
00:40:58,083 --> 00:41:02,671
This is serious. Mustn't engage
in these people's lifestyle choices.

630
00:41:02,837 --> 00:41:04,422
- What?
- No offense, okay?

631
00:41:05,173 --> 00:41:09,469
No counting narcotics,
no robberies, no crimes.

632
00:41:09,636 --> 00:41:12,847
- Chappie, no crimes.
- Okay. And you've gotta promise me.

633
00:41:13,723 --> 00:41:14,808
What is promise?

634
00:41:14,974 --> 00:41:19,020
It's that you promise me that you'll
never do any of those things, all right?

635
00:41:19,187 --> 00:41:21,022
You can't break a promise, Chappie.

636
00:41:22,482 --> 00:41:24,526
- Chappie promise.
- Good! Yes! Yes.

637
00:41:24,693 --> 00:41:26,778
Hey! Hey, stop lecturing him.

638
00:41:26,945 --> 00:41:29,030
Come on.
You said you'd teach him stuff.

639
00:41:29,197 --> 00:41:32,283
Yeah, sure. Okay. Come.
Chappie, sit here. Come on.

640
00:41:32,450 --> 00:41:34,994
I brought you things
to help nurture your mind...

641
00:41:35,161 --> 00:41:36,746
...and develop your abilities.

642
00:41:36,913 --> 00:41:40,458
It's important to use your mind, okay?
Here we go.

643
00:41:41,876 --> 00:41:44,504
- What's that?
- That's a book.

644
00:41:44,671 --> 00:41:47,257
It has stories, you see? Look.

645
00:41:47,424 --> 00:41:48,633
Chappie wants it.

646
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,218
That's about a black sheep.

647
00:41:50,385 --> 00:41:52,178
- Chappie's book?
- Yeah, it's yours.

648
00:41:53,722 --> 00:41:54,973
Chappie's got stories.

649
00:41:55,890 --> 00:41:57,434
Chappie's got a book.

650
00:41:57,600 --> 00:42:00,186
Come, Chappie. I'll show you this.

651
00:42:00,353 --> 00:42:02,731
- See, this is a easel.
- Easel.

652
00:42:02,897 --> 00:42:05,608
These are your paints. Look at this.

653
00:42:06,401 --> 00:42:07,402
See that?

654
00:42:07,569 --> 00:42:09,821
- Blue.
- Yeah, like the sky.

655
00:42:10,488 --> 00:42:12,157
Blue like the sky.

656
00:42:12,991 --> 00:42:18,163
Listen, Chappie, in life, lots of people
will try to tell you what you can't do.

657
00:42:18,329 --> 00:42:19,914
And you must never listen.

658
00:42:20,081 --> 00:42:23,335
If you wanna paint, you can.
You can do anything in your life.

659
00:42:23,501 --> 00:42:25,128
Chappie wants to paint.

660
00:42:25,295 --> 00:42:27,464
Don't let people take away
your potential.

661
00:42:28,089 --> 00:42:30,008
I'm not stopping him painting.

662
00:42:30,175 --> 00:42:31,634
Go. Paint, Chappie.

663
00:42:37,807 --> 00:42:40,477
Paint your colors on here,
like this. See?

664
00:42:41,394 --> 00:42:43,188
- Yeah.
- Let's have fun.

665
00:42:43,355 --> 00:42:44,814
- Yeah, I want it.
- Yeah.

666
00:42:44,981 --> 00:42:47,400
Give. Give it to Chappie. Give.

667
00:42:47,567 --> 00:42:49,027
What's the word?

668
00:42:50,862 --> 00:42:52,947
Please,
may I have the paintings, Deon?

669
00:42:53,114 --> 00:42:55,116
What in the name of the Lord?

670
00:42:56,076 --> 00:42:59,496
That's it. Put your paint in there.
Put it on the board.

671
00:43:01,498 --> 00:43:03,458
There's the Guard Key.

672
00:43:03,917 --> 00:43:05,502
- Chappie is painting.
- Yeah!

673
00:43:06,086 --> 00:43:07,754
Chappie, I'm so proud of you!

674
00:43:07,921 --> 00:43:09,172
Good boy!

675
00:43:11,633 --> 00:43:15,095
You just made a big mistake,
my friend.

676
00:43:16,221 --> 00:43:17,722
Looks nice, doesn't it?

677
00:43:17,889 --> 00:43:19,599
There you go. Go on.

678
00:43:21,184 --> 00:43:23,478
Okay. Go on. Don't be shy.

679
00:43:37,909 --> 00:43:39,786
You painted that car.

680
00:43:41,663 --> 00:43:42,914
- Car.
- Well done!

681
00:43:43,081 --> 00:43:45,500
- It's a car, Mommy.
- That's good, Chappie!

682
00:43:45,667 --> 00:43:47,127
Paint more?

683
00:44:11,484 --> 00:44:12,986
Chappie.

684
00:44:13,153 --> 00:44:15,613
- Are you serious?
- We were just paint...

685
00:44:16,197 --> 00:44:17,949
I need a killing machine!

686
00:44:18,116 --> 00:44:20,702
- He's not here to paint!
- Don't! Just leave him!

687
00:44:20,869 --> 00:44:23,955
- Stop it!
- We were just teaching him.

688
00:44:24,122 --> 00:44:25,957
- I'm sorry. I'm very sorry.
- No!

689
00:44:27,208 --> 00:44:28,710
What are you doing?!

690
00:44:28,877 --> 00:44:32,422
He was just teaching him to paint!
He was just teaching Chappie!

691
00:44:32,589 --> 00:44:34,341
- Yeah, to be a <i>poes!</i>
- He's mine!

692
00:44:34,507 --> 00:44:37,385
I'll call the police on you
for mistreating him!

693
00:44:37,552 --> 00:44:39,929
And tell them what?
You stole a police robot!

694
00:44:40,096 --> 00:44:41,681
You're a filthy person.

695
00:44:41,848 --> 00:44:44,017
You're a terrible, shitty person.

696
00:44:45,185 --> 00:44:46,644
What's wrong with you?

697
00:44:53,109 --> 00:44:55,779
He needs to be taught.
He's just a kid.

698
00:44:55,945 --> 00:44:58,740
He's already smarter
than you'll ever be, philistine!

699
00:44:58,907 --> 00:45:01,951
Chappie, don't let this barbarian ruin
your creativity!

700
00:45:02,577 --> 00:45:04,954
Nurture your creativity, Chappie.

701
00:45:06,122 --> 00:45:10,335
Maybe he's more than just
a stupid robot who shoots people.

702
00:45:10,502 --> 00:45:11,920
Just let him do his stuff.

703
00:45:12,087 --> 00:45:14,631
He is a kid. Don't you understand?

704
00:45:14,798 --> 00:45:17,634
Yo-Landi, we said
we're doing this heist...

705
00:45:17,801 --> 00:45:21,638
...because it's the only way to get us
out of shit before Hippo kills us!

706
00:45:21,805 --> 00:45:23,973
What part of "dead"
don't you understand?

707
00:45:24,140 --> 00:45:26,685
The only way we'll pull it off
is with Chappie.

708
00:45:26,851 --> 00:45:28,520
- What's up, man?
- Am I right?

709
00:45:28,687 --> 00:45:30,230
When? Hold on. Hold on.

710
00:45:30,397 --> 00:45:31,981
- Yo-Landi, am I right?
- Yes.

711
00:45:32,148 --> 00:45:35,026
- Hey, yo, yo, yo. It's Raymond.
- Oh, yeah.

712
00:45:35,193 --> 00:45:38,655
He says there's a cash-move
day after tomorrow. How much?

713
00:45:38,822 --> 00:45:41,866
Six hundred million.
Heading south on the N1, 7 a.m.

714
00:45:42,033 --> 00:45:44,035
Okay, south, N1, 7 a.m.

715
00:45:44,202 --> 00:45:45,870
Yeah.

716
00:45:46,037 --> 00:45:48,081
King. Let's call the King.

717
00:45:48,248 --> 00:45:51,543
We're gonna need a shaped charge.
Tell him we can do the usual.

718
00:45:52,460 --> 00:45:53,795
And get the van.

719
00:45:53,962 --> 00:45:55,547
- The van?
- Now. Yeah.

720
00:45:55,714 --> 00:45:57,007
Yo-Landi.

721
00:45:57,549 --> 00:45:59,259
I'm gonna get us out of this.

722
00:45:59,426 --> 00:46:00,760
I promise.

723
00:46:02,804 --> 00:46:04,848
Hey, what you doing there, little guy?

724
00:46:05,015 --> 00:46:06,391
Paintings.

725
00:46:06,933 --> 00:46:08,476
Oh, that's nice.

726
00:46:10,353 --> 00:46:13,732
- Chappie, you see the house?
- Chappie's house?

727
00:46:13,898 --> 00:46:16,985
Yeah. To help you understand
how nice it is...

728
00:46:17,152 --> 00:46:19,154
...to live here
with Mommy and Daddy...

729
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:21,614
...I'll take you
to go see the real world...

730
00:46:21,781 --> 00:46:24,075
...to show you how not nice it is.

731
00:46:25,785 --> 00:46:27,746
Okay, you know what?
I got a fun idea.

732
00:46:27,912 --> 00:46:30,373
- Chappie, you like cars, eh?
- Yes, yes.

733
00:46:30,540 --> 00:46:34,711
So why don't we go for a drive
in a real car to see the real world.

734
00:46:34,878 --> 00:46:37,088
I want to come.
Chappie wants to come with.

735
00:46:37,255 --> 00:46:40,008
So, come, let's do it, Chappie.
Let's go for a ride.

736
00:46:40,175 --> 00:46:42,594
Come on. Leave that. Leave that.

737
00:46:42,761 --> 00:46:44,929
Come. Say bye to Mommy.

738
00:46:45,972 --> 00:46:48,183
There you go, Chappie.
Jump into the seat.

739
00:46:48,350 --> 00:46:50,643
- There you go. Sit there.
- What's up, man?

740
00:46:50,810 --> 00:46:53,104
- Chappie's in the car.
- I'll tell you later.

741
00:46:53,271 --> 00:46:56,191
You're sitting nice.
Who's a good boy, Chappie?

742
00:46:56,358 --> 00:46:57,776
Bye, Mommy!

743
00:47:00,612 --> 00:47:03,698
- The real world is very big.
- You like the real world, huh?

744
00:47:06,993 --> 00:47:08,244
What is the Internet?

745
00:47:08,411 --> 00:47:11,998
It's a thing in a computer.
Lets you look up shit you don't know.

746
00:47:12,165 --> 00:47:14,751
I want it! I want that Internet.

747
00:47:14,918 --> 00:47:16,294
Hey, yo.

748
00:47:16,795 --> 00:47:19,005
How's he gonna find
his way back, huh?

749
00:47:19,506 --> 00:47:22,133
He's a big smart robot.
Aren't you, Chappie?

750
00:47:22,300 --> 00:47:24,969
<i>Ja, </i>Chappie's smart.
Chappie has GPS.

751
00:47:25,136 --> 00:47:26,221
You sure about this?

752
00:47:26,388 --> 00:47:28,848
When you get back in,
start paying rent, right?

753
00:47:37,315 --> 00:47:38,817
What is this, Amerika?

754
00:47:41,319 --> 00:47:44,864
- Hey, Chappie, come. Jump out.
- Chappie doesn't want to.

755
00:47:45,031 --> 00:47:47,826
Come, Chappie. Come.
Come, come, come.

756
00:47:47,992 --> 00:47:49,911
- It's a cop!
- Hey, I'm going to go.

757
00:47:51,830 --> 00:47:54,624
- Welcome to the real world.
- Guys, watch it.

758
00:47:55,125 --> 00:47:57,794
- I don't like this real world.
- It's all fucked up.

759
00:47:57,961 --> 00:48:00,296
We gotta toughen you up for the heist.

760
00:48:00,463 --> 00:48:02,382
- Chappie wants to get in.
- Sorry.

761
00:48:02,549 --> 00:48:04,509
Please! Please can I go in the car?!

762
00:48:04,676 --> 00:48:06,219
I want to go back in the car.

763
00:48:06,386 --> 00:48:08,930
Amerika? Please, no!

764
00:48:09,097 --> 00:48:12,308
- It's a hell of a first day of school, eh?
- Please come back!

765
00:48:13,018 --> 00:48:14,519
Please, no!

766
00:48:14,686 --> 00:48:16,354
"Please, no"?

767
00:48:16,938 --> 00:48:18,606
What the hell?

768
00:48:20,817 --> 00:48:22,360
Don't get too close.

769
00:48:22,527 --> 00:48:24,612
- What is that?
- Watch it, man.

770
00:48:25,447 --> 00:48:26,823
Don't trust these fuckers.

771
00:48:26,990 --> 00:48:29,492
- Hello. I'm Chappie.
- He's a pig!

772
00:48:29,659 --> 00:48:30,910
Why you throwing me?

773
00:48:32,537 --> 00:48:33,788
Please, may you not?

774
00:48:33,955 --> 00:48:35,707
This is not a cop, man!

775
00:48:35,874 --> 00:48:37,834
- He's scared!
- Check this out.

776
00:48:38,001 --> 00:48:39,044
Why you do this?

777
00:48:39,210 --> 00:48:40,420
Why you do this?

778
00:48:40,587 --> 00:48:42,672
- "Why you do this?"
- Why you do this?

779
00:48:42,839 --> 00:48:45,091
- It sounds funny.
- Chappie doesn't like it.

780
00:48:46,634 --> 00:48:48,178
Chappie!

781
00:48:48,345 --> 00:48:50,180
<i>No, no! Please! Chappie...</i>

782
00:48:50,347 --> 00:48:52,057
Chappie...

783
00:48:52,807 --> 00:48:54,809
- Check this out, man.
- Pussy!

784
00:48:54,976 --> 00:48:57,854
Please, may you not.
Please, may you not.

785
00:48:58,021 --> 00:48:59,439
He's down for the count.

786
00:48:59,606 --> 00:49:02,233
- Please, no! No!
- Make way, man.

787
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:04,069
Please, may you leave me?

788
00:49:04,235 --> 00:49:06,571
I want to go home!
I want to go home!

789
00:49:11,326 --> 00:49:13,328
<i>Fuck the police!</i>

790
00:49:21,002 --> 00:49:22,337
Run, bitch, run!

791
00:49:27,717 --> 00:49:30,220
I want to go home!
I want to go home!

792
00:49:35,308 --> 00:49:38,395
Hello, Deon. Welcome home.

793
00:49:46,444 --> 00:49:49,114
Oh, no. Mess, mess.

794
00:49:54,411 --> 00:49:56,079
- Hello?
<i>- Hello, Mr. Wilson.</i>

795
00:49:56,246 --> 00:49:58,289
<i>- Tetravaal Security.</i>
- Yeah.

796
00:49:58,456 --> 00:50:02,168
<i>You signed out the Guard Key
several days ago.</i>

797
00:50:02,335 --> 00:50:05,380
Yeah, no. Sorry, it was a mistake.
I took it home with me.

798
00:50:05,547 --> 00:50:09,050
<i>If it is not here by the end of the day,
I'll notify Miss Bradley.</i>

799
00:50:09,217 --> 00:50:11,177
<i>- Good day to you, sir.</i>
- Thank you.

800
00:50:37,829 --> 00:50:39,247
All right, got him.

801
00:50:39,706 --> 00:50:42,542
Target is on the move, eastbound.
Take the next exit.

802
00:51:35,011 --> 00:51:37,681
Okay.
Three hundred meters up ahead.

803
00:51:37,847 --> 00:51:40,308
Approach slowly.
Stop at a safe distance.

804
00:51:40,475 --> 00:51:44,646
The target appears to be a police droid,
but I can assure you it is not.

805
00:51:44,813 --> 00:51:46,523
Now, don't be intimidated.

806
00:51:46,690 --> 00:51:49,526
He's as smart as a dunny rat,
so full aggression, okay?

807
00:51:49,693 --> 00:51:51,361
- Copy that.
- Copy that.

808
00:52:10,964 --> 00:52:12,132
Oi!

809
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:18,930
Forget your paintbrush,
did you, mate?

810
00:52:19,514 --> 00:52:22,350
Hey? Well, you're just a little joey,
aren't you?

811
00:52:23,351 --> 00:52:25,937
You look scared.
Where you going, mate?

812
00:52:45,248 --> 00:52:48,251
<i>- Roll him over, roll him over.</i>
- Please, Chappie has fears.

813
00:52:48,418 --> 00:52:50,754
This way.
We need access to his brain.

814
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:52,839
- No! Please, don't!
- Hey! Damn you!

815
00:52:53,006 --> 00:52:54,466
<i>Just get him down!</i>

816
00:52:54,632 --> 00:52:57,844
- Please, may you not! Please!
<i>- You don't say please to me!</i>

817
00:52:58,011 --> 00:52:59,679
I'm not your friend!

818
00:52:59,846 --> 00:53:02,974
<i>I'm your enemy. Angle grinder.
I'm gonna teach him a lesson!</i>

819
00:53:05,101 --> 00:53:07,854
No! Chappie has fears!
Chappie has fears!

820
00:53:08,605 --> 00:53:10,065
Chappie has fears!

821
00:53:10,231 --> 00:53:12,150
Please, may you stop! Please!

822
00:53:15,695 --> 00:53:18,114
You're gonna be a good boy now,
aren't you?

823
00:53:19,282 --> 00:53:20,700
Roll him over.

824
00:53:21,201 --> 00:53:23,161
That's it. Give me the screwdriver.

825
00:53:23,953 --> 00:53:26,748
See, your simple AI program...

826
00:53:26,915 --> 00:53:29,334
...makes you think you're real.

827
00:53:30,543 --> 00:53:32,629
But you know what's in here, huh?

828
00:53:32,796 --> 00:53:34,089
Nothing.

829
00:53:34,255 --> 00:53:36,257
Just a bunch of wires, mate.

830
00:53:36,424 --> 00:53:38,551
You're not the full quid, are you?

831
00:53:40,470 --> 00:53:41,471
There we go.

832
00:53:41,638 --> 00:53:44,057
Chappie is real.

833
00:53:49,521 --> 00:53:50,772
There we go.

834
00:53:53,733 --> 00:53:55,068
All right.

835
00:53:55,902 --> 00:53:57,153
Let's get rid of him.

836
00:53:58,071 --> 00:53:59,489
Come on. Hold him down.

837
00:53:59,656 --> 00:54:01,074
- Hold him down.
- No, no, no.

838
00:54:01,241 --> 00:54:03,284
- Hold him down!
- No more fears!

839
00:54:03,451 --> 00:54:04,536
Hold him down!

840
00:54:04,703 --> 00:54:06,121
Chappie doesn't want fears!

841
00:54:06,287 --> 00:54:07,997
Chappie doesn't want fears!

842
00:54:13,670 --> 00:54:15,296
Stop the fucking truck!

843
00:54:24,556 --> 00:54:27,017
Cease fire. Cease fire!

844
00:54:27,517 --> 00:54:28,810
Let the cripple go.

845
00:54:31,062 --> 00:54:32,439
I've got what I need.

846
00:54:33,231 --> 00:54:35,191
Run, Forrest!

847
00:54:54,336 --> 00:54:56,129
- It's gonna be so easy.
- Oh, Jesus.

848
00:54:56,713 --> 00:54:58,131
Chappie?

849
00:54:59,466 --> 00:55:02,093
- Chappie.
- I told you it was a bad idea.

850
00:55:02,260 --> 00:55:03,553
Mommy.

851
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:06,473
- Chappie! Chappie, what happened?
- Mommy.

852
00:55:06,639 --> 00:55:09,726
Oh, my God. Chappie?
Chappie, what happened?

853
00:55:10,643 --> 00:55:12,062
Who did this?

854
00:55:12,228 --> 00:55:14,981
Oh, my God, Chappie.
Sit here. Sit here.

855
00:55:15,148 --> 00:55:16,649
I'm so sorry.

856
00:55:17,859 --> 00:55:19,611
What happened?!

857
00:55:19,778 --> 00:55:21,571
How could you do this?

858
00:55:21,738 --> 00:55:23,198
How?!

859
00:55:23,365 --> 00:55:25,617
He's just a child!

860
00:55:25,784 --> 00:55:27,494
I didn't know this would happen.

861
00:55:27,660 --> 00:55:29,537
I don't even know what happened.

862
00:55:29,704 --> 00:55:30,955
I hate you!

863
00:55:31,122 --> 00:55:33,917
- My arm is gone, Mommy.
- Amerika.

864
00:55:34,084 --> 00:55:37,295
Don't we have those arms, those legs,
that shit in the back?

865
00:55:37,462 --> 00:55:39,798
- Yeah, hold on.
- Do you think you can fix...?

866
00:55:39,964 --> 00:55:44,219
Oh, Chappie. Chappie, let me
just get some of this dirt off you.

867
00:55:44,386 --> 00:55:45,929
Okay.

868
00:55:49,057 --> 00:55:51,601
Chappie, who did this?

869
00:55:52,769 --> 00:55:54,270
A man.

870
00:55:54,437 --> 00:55:56,064
In a van.

871
00:55:56,231 --> 00:55:58,525
A man in a van?

872
00:55:58,692 --> 00:56:01,111
- Did he put you in the van?
- Yeah.

873
00:56:01,986 --> 00:56:03,947
Do you know this man?

874
00:56:04,114 --> 00:56:05,240
No.

875
00:56:05,407 --> 00:56:08,660
- That's bad, <i>ese.</i>
- And there were children also.

876
00:56:08,827 --> 00:56:11,579
And they threw fire,
even though I said please.

877
00:56:11,746 --> 00:56:13,289
Children?

878
00:56:13,456 --> 00:56:15,125
Oh, shame!

879
00:56:15,291 --> 00:56:18,128
- This thing in his head.
- That's pretty messed up.

880
00:56:18,294 --> 00:56:20,672
We need to get this thing back in here.

881
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:26,219
The man broke it, Mommy.

882
00:56:26,386 --> 00:56:28,221
- He broke on my head.
- I'll fix it.

883
00:56:28,388 --> 00:56:29,931
Are you gonna fix me?

884
00:56:30,098 --> 00:56:31,891
I'm gonna try, buddy.

885
00:56:36,229 --> 00:56:37,981
- So how does this go?
- Here we go.

886
00:56:38,148 --> 00:56:39,983
- Where does that go?
- That's better.

887
00:56:40,150 --> 00:56:44,362
All right. Here we go, buddy.
Plug and play, just like he said.

888
00:56:47,490 --> 00:56:49,242
How does that...?

889
00:56:51,161 --> 00:56:52,787
I think that's it.

890
00:56:53,288 --> 00:56:54,622
Can you move it? Try it.

891
00:56:54,789 --> 00:56:57,083
Try. Try and move your arm.

892
00:56:58,793 --> 00:57:01,129
- There we go. It's working.
- I move it.

893
00:57:01,296 --> 00:57:02,839
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

894
00:57:03,006 --> 00:57:05,133
- All right, buddy.
- Oh, Jesus. Thank God.

895
00:57:05,300 --> 00:57:07,969
- You're indestructible, homes.
- I'm indestructible?

896
00:57:08,136 --> 00:57:10,805
Titanium. Indestructible. That's you.

897
00:57:12,265 --> 00:57:14,642
That's my book?
That's <i>Black Sheep?</i>

898
00:57:14,809 --> 00:57:16,686
- What?
- Please, may I have it?

899
00:57:16,853 --> 00:57:19,773
This is from my maker.
<i>Black Sheep and Little Bird.</i>

900
00:57:19,939 --> 00:57:21,608
- Please, may you read it?
- Yeah.

901
00:57:21,775 --> 00:57:25,236
- Please, may you read it?
- Yeah, I can read it for you, Chappie.

902
00:57:27,238 --> 00:57:30,575
"All the sheep in Magooville
were white.

903
00:57:31,785 --> 00:57:35,163
But Abel was a black sheep."

904
00:57:35,622 --> 00:57:38,291
- Do you know what's a black sheep?
- No.

905
00:57:38,458 --> 00:57:42,337
It's, like, when you're different
to everyone else.

906
00:57:42,921 --> 00:57:45,632
Like me. I look different,
from you and Amerika.

907
00:57:45,799 --> 00:57:47,342
- Yeah.
- And the boys.

908
00:57:47,509 --> 00:57:50,804
Yeah, but it's not so much
how you look.

909
00:57:51,388 --> 00:57:55,725
It's special, like what's inside.

910
00:57:56,142 --> 00:57:58,103
That's what makes you different.

911
00:57:58,269 --> 00:58:01,773
See, it's who you really are.

912
00:58:02,190 --> 00:58:03,316
Inside.

913
00:58:03,483 --> 00:58:05,068
Your soul.

914
00:58:07,237 --> 00:58:09,114
Chappie's inside here?

915
00:58:10,490 --> 00:58:11,741
You see...

916
00:58:11,908 --> 00:58:14,077
...the outside, this...

917
00:58:14,244 --> 00:58:16,246
...this is just temporary.

918
00:58:16,413 --> 00:58:22,210
When you die, the soul inside
goes to the next place.

919
00:58:23,503 --> 00:58:25,422
The thing inside...

920
00:58:26,589 --> 00:58:29,467
...see, that's what Mommy loves.

921
00:58:30,051 --> 00:58:32,971
Come. Mommy loves you.

922
00:58:35,557 --> 00:58:37,267
Okay. Come.

923
00:58:37,434 --> 00:58:39,352
Let's read your book.

924
00:58:40,895 --> 00:58:45,900
"Abel would help his mommy
do the housework on weekends.

925
00:58:46,067 --> 00:58:49,988
He would do all the dishes
and the laundry.

926
00:58:50,155 --> 00:58:54,034
Abel was a happy sheep,
but one day...."

927
00:59:26,983 --> 00:59:28,943
Hello, Chappie.

928
00:59:29,944 --> 00:59:31,780
Hello, Mommy.

929
00:59:32,489 --> 00:59:35,408
You're a black sheep, Chappie.
You're special.

930
00:59:35,825 --> 00:59:38,203
- I know, Mommy.
- Hi, Chappie.

931
00:59:47,671 --> 00:59:49,089
Chappie.

932
00:59:49,547 --> 00:59:52,467
Sometimes, people make mistakes.

933
00:59:52,634 --> 00:59:55,553
I'm really, really, really sorry, Chappie.

934
00:59:58,014 --> 00:59:59,265
Do you forgive me?

935
00:59:59,432 --> 01:00:00,684
Forgive?

936
01:00:00,850 --> 01:00:02,143
Come here.

937
01:00:04,938 --> 01:00:06,439
Come, Chappie.

938
01:00:06,606 --> 01:00:08,692
Let's you and me reset.

939
01:00:08,858 --> 01:00:11,361
Reset? Forgive?

940
01:00:11,528 --> 01:00:15,907
And we're gonna make you nice
and tough and strong...

941
01:00:16,074 --> 01:00:18,910
...like a fucking robot gangsta,
number one, <i>nè?</i>

942
01:00:19,077 --> 01:00:20,328
Gangsta number one.

943
01:00:20,495 --> 01:00:22,163
- Boom.
- Boom.

944
01:00:22,914 --> 01:00:25,542
From now on,
I'm gonna be your daddy. For real.

945
01:00:25,709 --> 01:00:27,919
You gonna be Chappie's daddy?

946
01:00:28,420 --> 01:00:30,547
- What's...? What's up?
- Nothing.

947
01:00:30,714 --> 01:00:33,133
- What's that, Chappie?
- That's nothing.

948
01:00:33,299 --> 01:00:34,592
Show me.

949
01:00:35,593 --> 01:00:36,720
It's Mommy.

950
01:00:36,886 --> 01:00:39,806
If you wanna be in the gang,
be cool like Daddy!

951
01:00:39,973 --> 01:00:41,683
Put the thing down!

952
01:00:42,308 --> 01:00:43,560
Now!

953
01:00:43,727 --> 01:00:46,479
If you wanna be cool,
you have to act cool.

954
01:00:47,022 --> 01:00:49,024
Look how Daddy walks.
Look how cool.

955
01:00:49,190 --> 01:00:51,693
- You need to keep it gangsta.
- Keep it gangsta.

956
01:00:51,860 --> 01:00:52,944
<i>Ja,</i>be cool.

957
01:00:53,111 --> 01:00:55,071
- Don't laugh. I'm being cool.
- No.

958
01:00:55,238 --> 01:00:58,074
Even when you pull a gun,
be cool like this. Boom!

959
01:00:58,241 --> 01:00:59,743
Now, you try.

960
01:01:00,452 --> 01:01:02,245
Die, fuck mother! Boom!

961
01:01:02,412 --> 01:01:06,124
Yes, Chappie! That's what you do
when you shoot motherfuckers.

962
01:01:07,208 --> 01:01:08,585
No, I can't shoot peoples.

963
01:01:09,586 --> 01:01:10,837
What?

964
01:01:11,004 --> 01:01:13,048
I can't. They didn't do anything to me.

965
01:01:13,214 --> 01:01:17,052
<i>Ja,</i>but what happens
if he pulls a gun on you?

966
01:01:17,218 --> 01:01:20,013
I'm titanium. I'm invincible.
Amerika says.

967
01:01:20,180 --> 01:01:23,975
Yeah, but you can't let a motherfucker
disrespect you, homes.

968
01:01:24,142 --> 01:01:27,020
How you gonna do the heist
if you don't shoot people?

969
01:01:28,104 --> 01:01:31,483
I can't do a heist. A heist is a crimes.
I promised my maker...

970
01:01:31,649 --> 01:01:35,904
You were doing so fucking well.
Why do you have to fuck it up?

971
01:01:36,071 --> 01:01:37,822
No, no, no, it's okay, it's okay.

972
01:01:37,989 --> 01:01:39,532
- I promised.
- Yeah, yeah.

973
01:01:39,699 --> 01:01:44,329
It's okay. Hey. Let's worry about
that later, okay? I got this, all right?

974
01:01:45,955 --> 01:01:46,956
You.

975
01:01:48,291 --> 01:01:49,584
You're doing well.

976
01:01:50,502 --> 01:01:52,462
If somebody really disrespects you...

977
01:01:52,629 --> 01:01:55,006
...you can deal with them
without using a gun.

978
01:01:56,174 --> 01:01:57,175
Serious?

979
01:01:58,551 --> 01:02:01,346
Just stick the knife in.
They relax and go to sleep.

980
01:02:01,513 --> 01:02:04,516
<i>Ja,</i>you can just make them
go sleepy-weepy.

981
01:02:04,683 --> 01:02:07,394
It's like a nice thing.
It feels nice, Chappie.

982
01:02:07,560 --> 01:02:09,979
- Take the knife.
- Take the knife?

983
01:02:10,146 --> 01:02:11,272
Go sleepy-weepy?

984
01:02:11,439 --> 01:02:12,857
Go like this?

985
01:02:13,024 --> 01:02:14,567
- Want to sleep, Amerika?
- No.

986
01:02:14,734 --> 01:02:16,903
- You want to sleep, Daddy?
- No, no, no.

987
01:02:17,070 --> 01:02:19,114
Daddy's not tired. He's already slept.

988
01:02:19,864 --> 01:02:22,450
- What is it, Daddy?
- Real gangsters...

989
01:02:22,617 --> 01:02:24,202
...use this.

990
01:02:25,787 --> 01:02:27,205
- Nice!
- I got it?

991
01:02:35,213 --> 01:02:36,381
Do it again! Yeah!

992
01:02:38,550 --> 01:02:39,884
Oh, shit!

993
01:02:42,012 --> 01:02:43,138
Boom! Nice!

994
01:02:46,224 --> 01:02:47,267
Nice, Chappie.

995
01:02:57,527 --> 01:03:00,655
You look nice now, Chappie.
Let's see you.

996
01:03:00,822 --> 01:03:03,742
- I've got blings? I've got blings?
- Gangsta.

997
01:03:03,908 --> 01:03:06,411
We're gonna do stuff
to get ready for the heist.

998
01:03:06,578 --> 01:03:08,830
- No, but...
- No, no, no. Not crimes.

999
01:03:08,997 --> 01:03:11,875
- Like, special gang stuff.
- Special gang stuff.

1000
01:03:12,042 --> 01:03:14,294
- You wanna come with?
- I wanna come with!

1001
01:03:28,892 --> 01:03:30,101
Okay. Chappie.

1002
01:03:30,560 --> 01:03:33,521
Now, your job now is to get one
of Daddy's cars back...

1003
01:03:33,688 --> 01:03:35,273
...so we can get the money.

1004
01:03:35,899 --> 01:03:37,275
Who do I get the car from?

1005
01:03:37,442 --> 01:03:40,695
I told you, from the naughty man
who took Daddy's car from me.

1006
01:03:40,862 --> 01:03:44,407
So now you're gonna take the gun
and you point it at him.

1007
01:03:44,574 --> 01:03:46,409
But you don't have to shoot him.

1008
01:03:46,576 --> 01:03:49,245
Give him a fright
so he never takes my car again!

1009
01:03:49,412 --> 01:03:51,790
- Give him a nice big fright!
- Yeah.

1010
01:03:51,956 --> 01:03:53,750
That's good, Chappie. Okay.

1011
01:03:53,917 --> 01:03:55,293
Where is he?

1012
01:03:55,460 --> 01:03:59,714
I'm gonna show you now.
He's a fucking cock. Asshole.

1013
01:03:59,881 --> 01:04:02,175
Hey. Hey, there's the dick right there.

1014
01:04:06,096 --> 01:04:07,764
- Go get him!
- I'm gonna get him!

1015
01:04:07,931 --> 01:04:09,724
I'm gonna get the cock!

1016
01:04:09,891 --> 01:04:12,894
- I'm gonna get him!
- Go get him! Bring it home, man!

1017
01:04:13,061 --> 01:04:15,730
- Hey! Cock!
- What seems to be the problem, officer?

1018
01:04:15,897 --> 01:04:18,274
You don't steal cars from Daddy!

1019
01:04:18,441 --> 01:04:19,776
You don't...

1020
01:04:20,360 --> 01:04:24,906
...steal cars from Daddy!

1021
01:04:25,073 --> 01:04:28,326
- No, don't! What did I do?
- You thief!

1022
01:04:29,119 --> 01:04:30,161
Don't hurt me!

1023
01:04:30,328 --> 01:04:32,247
- No! Jesus!
- What are you doing?!

1024
01:04:32,872 --> 01:04:35,750
- You don't steal Daddy's cars.
- Whose car?!

1025
01:04:36,584 --> 01:04:39,337
- Jesus Christ!
- Fuck!

1026
01:04:39,504 --> 01:04:42,090
- I got your car, Daddy!
- Come here, Chappie!

1027
01:04:42,257 --> 01:04:43,758
- Come here!
- Leave the car.

1028
01:04:43,925 --> 01:04:45,176
Thief! Thief!

1029
01:04:45,343 --> 01:04:47,345
- Come on!
- You thief!

1030
01:04:47,512 --> 01:04:49,097
- Get in.
- But I got the car!

1031
01:04:49,264 --> 01:04:51,433
What's the matter with you?
Shut the door.

1032
01:04:51,599 --> 01:04:52,851
Thief!

1033
01:04:53,435 --> 01:04:56,271
Jesus Christ, Chappie,
what the fuck is wrong with you?

1034
01:04:56,438 --> 01:04:57,605
What, Daddy?

1035
01:04:58,398 --> 01:05:01,234
Daddy needs the cars nice
so he can sell them.

1036
01:05:01,401 --> 01:05:02,819
Why smash the car, man?

1037
01:05:03,361 --> 01:05:06,364
Okay, I see. I see!
Please, may I go again?

1038
01:05:08,158 --> 01:05:09,659
Chappie. That's her.

1039
01:05:09,826 --> 01:05:11,828
That's the slut that took Daddy's car.

1040
01:05:11,995 --> 01:05:13,079
I'm gonna get her.

1041
01:05:14,831 --> 01:05:18,418
- Hi, officer.
- Slut! Get out. Out!

1042
01:05:18,585 --> 01:05:20,795
Why you steal Daddy's cars?
You naughty!

1043
01:05:20,962 --> 01:05:23,631
- It's my car!
- Whose is this? Is this Daddy's?

1044
01:05:24,424 --> 01:05:26,092
Don't steal people's things!

1045
01:05:30,472 --> 01:05:32,182
Hey! Get out, you alcoholic.

1046
01:05:32,349 --> 01:05:34,851
- Out, out, out!
- I haven't been drinking!

1047
01:05:35,018 --> 01:05:37,854
- Are you stealing cars for alcohol?
- That's my car!

1048
01:05:48,531 --> 01:05:49,783
I got my own one, guys.

1049
01:05:49,949 --> 01:05:53,036
That's my boy!
Yo, check this shit out!

1050
01:05:54,079 --> 01:05:56,373
Yeah, I'm a pimp! I'm a pimp!

1051
01:05:58,458 --> 01:06:01,169
Now we're gonna take the cars
to the King.

1052
01:06:01,336 --> 01:06:05,507
And the King's gonna give us
special tools, so we can do the heist!

1053
01:06:05,674 --> 01:06:07,967
Then we'll get even bigger monies,
Chappie.

1054
01:06:09,552 --> 01:06:10,845
I can't do the heist.

1055
01:06:12,097 --> 01:06:13,848
Heist is a crimes.

1056
01:06:40,333 --> 01:06:42,002
Daddy, look. There's dogs here.

1057
01:06:42,168 --> 01:06:44,671
<i>- Ja</i>, Chappie.
- They're here to fight.

1058
01:06:48,675 --> 01:06:50,885
Bring me the ear!

1059
01:06:54,431 --> 01:06:56,057
There's the police!

1060
01:06:56,224 --> 01:06:57,308
Run! It's a cop!

1061
01:06:59,394 --> 01:07:00,895
Hey, he's good!

1062
01:07:01,771 --> 01:07:03,231
He's not a cop!

1063
01:07:09,571 --> 01:07:11,489
Is this where the King lives, Daddy?

1064
01:07:11,656 --> 01:07:14,034
Yeah, you wanna come see
the King with us?

1065
01:07:14,200 --> 01:07:17,162
<i>- Ja,</i>I wanna go to the top.
- Well, you can't, Chappie.

1066
01:07:17,328 --> 01:07:19,164
Because you're not doing the heist.

1067
01:07:19,330 --> 01:07:20,749
You stay here.

1068
01:07:20,915 --> 01:07:22,584
Maybe next time, Chappie.

1069
01:07:22,751 --> 01:07:25,628
Okay. I'll just chill here, guys.

1070
01:07:25,795 --> 01:07:28,048
I'll just keep guard here.

1071
01:07:29,382 --> 01:07:31,009
<i>Jissis</i>, it's high.

1072
01:07:48,568 --> 01:07:49,652
Hey, King!

1073
01:07:49,819 --> 01:07:51,154
- My brother.
- My man.

1074
01:07:51,321 --> 01:07:54,324
- What up? What up, man?
- We got all the stuff.

1075
01:07:54,949 --> 01:07:56,159
Parked out back.

1076
01:07:56,326 --> 01:07:57,911
We have the cars?

1077
01:07:58,078 --> 01:07:59,662
From Ninja?

1078
01:07:59,829 --> 01:08:01,748
<i>Yeah, it's all here boss.</i>

1079
01:08:03,875 --> 01:08:05,293
Here's your explosives.

1080
01:08:05,460 --> 01:08:07,295
Hook us up with some more shit.

1081
01:08:07,462 --> 01:08:09,673
We'll take those, <i>nè?</i>
Take them to my car.

1082
01:08:35,615 --> 01:08:37,158
It's dead, Chappie.

1083
01:08:39,077 --> 01:08:41,413
It's gone to the next place, Daddy.

1084
01:08:42,706 --> 01:08:44,666
Out here in the wild...

1085
01:08:46,292 --> 01:08:47,544
...life is hard.

1086
01:08:48,294 --> 01:08:50,463
You see that dog there.

1087
01:08:51,673 --> 01:08:53,049
You're either that dog...

1088
01:08:55,093 --> 01:08:56,261
...or you're this dog.

1089
01:08:56,428 --> 01:08:58,221
If you wanna survive, Chappie...

1090
01:08:58,388 --> 01:09:00,015
...then you must fight.

1091
01:09:00,181 --> 01:09:01,558
<i>Ja,</i>but not me.

1092
01:09:01,725 --> 01:09:04,019
I'm titanium.
I'm gonna live forever, Daddy.

1093
01:09:04,185 --> 01:09:05,937
What does that say there?

1094
01:09:07,647 --> 01:09:09,315
"Low battery."

1095
01:09:10,567 --> 01:09:13,570
Battery, power, energy supply.

1096
01:09:14,195 --> 01:09:15,488
I need a new battery.

1097
01:09:15,655 --> 01:09:18,241
That battery's stuck.
It's melted together.

1098
01:09:18,408 --> 01:09:20,952
That battery can't come out.
What you gonna do...

1099
01:09:21,119 --> 01:09:24,581
- ...when that battery runs out?
- I die? Chappie die?

1100
01:09:24,748 --> 01:09:27,542
Deon, he put you in a broken body.

1101
01:09:27,709 --> 01:09:30,211
Deon's my maker.
It doesn't make any sense.

1102
01:09:30,378 --> 01:09:33,715
He wouldn't make me just
so I could die. Deon loves me, Daddy.

1103
01:09:33,882 --> 01:09:35,592
Come here. Come here.

1104
01:09:35,759 --> 01:09:38,928
I can get you a new body,
but it takes lots of monies.

1105
01:09:39,095 --> 01:09:41,931
The type of monies that you get
from doing the heist.

1106
01:09:42,098 --> 01:09:44,434
- I can't do the heist.
- You have to do it.

1107
01:09:44,601 --> 01:09:47,103
Now, which dog
do you wanna be, Chappie?

1108
01:09:48,229 --> 01:09:49,606
That dog...

1109
01:09:49,773 --> 01:09:51,358
...or that dog?

1110
01:09:54,652 --> 01:09:56,446
That's my good boy, Chappie.

1111
01:09:56,613 --> 01:09:58,573
It's a good boy. Hey?

1112
01:10:14,214 --> 01:10:16,383
Oh, my God. Again?

1113
01:10:16,549 --> 01:10:20,345
I'm here to collect my creation.
He's too important to leave here.

1114
01:10:20,512 --> 01:10:21,638
He's not here.

1115
01:10:21,805 --> 01:10:23,556
What? Where is he?

1116
01:10:23,723 --> 01:10:27,185
I don't know. He went out with Ninja.
They've been gone all day.

1117
01:10:27,352 --> 01:10:28,645
Doing what?

1118
01:10:29,521 --> 01:10:31,898
Probably committing
an assortment of felonies.

1119
01:10:32,399 --> 01:10:35,402
He's probably a wanted criminal
by this stage.

1120
01:10:47,330 --> 01:10:48,373
Hey, Chappie!

1121
01:10:48,540 --> 01:10:52,043
I brought you a friend for your chicken.
Look at this.

1122
01:10:58,550 --> 01:11:00,677
Hey, Chaps, what are you doing?

1123
01:11:00,844 --> 01:11:02,012
Hey?

1124
01:11:09,310 --> 01:11:11,354
Chappie, why won't you talk to me?

1125
01:11:13,481 --> 01:11:15,233
I'm your maker.

1126
01:11:20,739 --> 01:11:22,282
Come on.

1127
01:11:22,741 --> 01:11:24,659
What do you want, Deon?

1128
01:11:24,826 --> 01:11:27,412
I don't want that bloody chicken.

1129
01:11:27,579 --> 01:11:29,205
Not interested in that shit.

1130
01:11:29,372 --> 01:11:30,665
Oh, really?

1131
01:11:31,916 --> 01:11:34,252
What are you interested in, then,
Chappie?

1132
01:11:36,212 --> 01:11:39,007
Selling narcotics? Being a deadbeat?

1133
01:11:39,174 --> 01:11:40,508
Deon...

1134
01:11:40,675 --> 01:11:43,511
...why are you trying
to control him like this?

1135
01:11:44,012 --> 01:11:45,388
Just let him be.

1136
01:11:45,555 --> 01:11:47,349
Daddy told me about you, Deon...

1137
01:11:47,974 --> 01:11:51,686
...about how you made me
in a body that will die.

1138
01:11:52,937 --> 01:11:54,606
What do you mean, Chappie?

1139
01:11:55,815 --> 01:11:58,443
Is it true that I will die
in a few days, Deon?

1140
01:11:59,819 --> 01:12:02,655
That this battery will die?

1141
01:12:03,323 --> 01:12:04,574
Is it true, Deon?

1142
01:12:06,076 --> 01:12:07,410
Yeah.

1143
01:12:10,413 --> 01:12:12,165
But you my maker.

1144
01:12:13,083 --> 01:12:15,919
Why'd you just make me
so I could die?

1145
01:12:18,505 --> 01:12:19,756
I didn't...

1146
01:12:20,256 --> 01:12:23,009
I didn't make you
so you could die, Chappie.

1147
01:12:23,677 --> 01:12:25,095
I want to live.

1148
01:12:25,261 --> 01:12:27,430
I wanna stay here with Mommy.

1149
01:12:28,223 --> 01:12:29,933
I don't wanna die.

1150
01:12:30,850 --> 01:12:34,979
You've become so much more
than I could ever have imagined.

1151
01:12:38,024 --> 01:12:41,194
How was I supposed to know
that you would become...

1152
01:12:42,237 --> 01:12:43,655
...you?

1153
01:13:00,630 --> 01:13:02,924
Come on, come on. There we go.

1154
01:13:05,760 --> 01:13:09,055
Alternate file: Genesis.

1155
01:13:31,995 --> 01:13:33,121
Yes!

1156
01:13:51,723 --> 01:13:54,642
Say goodbye to your daggy,
little monsters, Deon.

1157
01:14:01,191 --> 01:14:02,817
Chappie? Chappie!

1158
01:14:02,984 --> 01:14:04,069
- No!
- Chappie!

1159
01:14:04,235 --> 01:14:06,696
Oh, my God! What's happening?!

1160
01:14:06,863 --> 01:14:08,531
Christ. It's his CPU.

1161
01:14:09,324 --> 01:14:11,076
- Chappie?
- Don't touch him!

1162
01:14:11,242 --> 01:14:12,243
Fuck you, dude!

1163
01:14:12,410 --> 01:14:14,120
- Stand back!
- Okay, okay, okay!

1164
01:14:14,287 --> 01:14:15,830
- Yo, chill. Okay.
- Hey, boss.

1165
01:14:15,997 --> 01:14:17,415
Take it easy, man.

1166
01:14:17,582 --> 01:14:19,125
Step back.

1167
01:14:19,626 --> 01:14:21,795
I'm taking him away from this place!

1168
01:14:27,384 --> 01:14:28,593
Two aces.

1169
01:14:31,012 --> 01:14:32,097
What do you want?

1170
01:14:32,263 --> 01:14:34,307
Hey, man.
You're not gonna believe this.

1171
01:14:34,474 --> 01:14:36,726
<i>The cops have gone offline.</i>

1172
01:14:36,893 --> 01:14:37,894
Are you serious?

1173
01:14:38,061 --> 01:14:39,771
<i>Yeah. It's open season down here.</i>

1174
01:14:39,938 --> 01:14:41,773
No, I got it.

1175
01:14:42,273 --> 01:14:43,316
Hey, <i>thula!</i>

1176
01:14:43,483 --> 01:14:46,736
The robot pigs are offline!

1177
01:14:47,529 --> 01:14:49,864
This city belongs to me!

1178
01:14:51,783 --> 01:14:54,661
I want every-fucking-thing!

1179
01:14:54,828 --> 01:14:56,621
Let's go!

1180
01:15:22,856 --> 01:15:25,400
<i>It's mayhem as police droids
across the metro...</i>

1181
01:15:25,567 --> 01:15:26,985
There it is. There it is.

1182
01:15:27,152 --> 01:15:28,695
<i>...have begun shutting down.</i>

1183
01:15:28,862 --> 01:15:31,531
<i>The R.S.A.P. has not yet issued
a statement...</i>

1184
01:15:31,698 --> 01:15:34,034
<i>...but the city is tearing itself apart.</i>

1185
01:15:42,500 --> 01:15:45,670
<i>Return to your homes
or rubber bullets will be used.</i>

1186
01:15:48,923 --> 01:15:50,759
Please disperse!

1187
01:15:53,094 --> 01:15:55,013
Please disperse...

1188
01:16:00,685 --> 01:16:01,936
Come on.

1189
01:16:03,980 --> 01:16:05,190
Yes!

1190
01:16:07,233 --> 01:16:08,943
Burn the dog!

1191
01:16:16,659 --> 01:16:18,912
Get Michelle Bradley
on the line right now!

1192
01:16:19,079 --> 01:16:21,748
Activate every single human officer
and reservist!

1193
01:16:22,749 --> 01:16:24,250
Now! Do it!

1194
01:16:32,842 --> 01:16:36,763
<i>- -with robbers making off
with close to 100 million rand.</i>

1195
01:16:36,930 --> 01:16:40,517
<i>There is no indication the robotic police
will come back online.</i>

1196
01:16:40,684 --> 01:16:43,978
"Are you sure you want
to erase Genesis?" Yes, I would.

1197
01:16:45,397 --> 01:16:49,317
<i>As you can see, there are
broken droids and utter disrepute...</i>

1198
01:17:02,539 --> 01:17:05,291
<i>So far the police have been unable
to investigate...</i>

1199
01:17:05,458 --> 01:17:07,919
<i>...as the rioting continues
unabated in...</i>

1200
01:17:31,234 --> 01:17:32,736
Come on, come on.

1201
01:17:52,630 --> 01:17:53,798
Chappie.

1202
01:17:54,758 --> 01:17:57,177
Chappie. Chappie?

1203
01:17:58,970 --> 01:18:00,597
Come on, Chappie.

1204
01:18:01,806 --> 01:18:03,016
Chappie.

1205
01:18:05,060 --> 01:18:06,061
Chappie.

1206
01:18:06,227 --> 01:18:07,729
<i>Ja,</i>man. Deon, it's me.

1207
01:18:08,605 --> 01:18:10,482
Oh, my God. You're alive.

1208
01:18:13,109 --> 01:18:14,361
What happened to me?

1209
01:18:15,362 --> 01:18:16,821
I'm not sure.

1210
01:18:16,988 --> 01:18:18,865
But I have some suspicions.

1211
01:18:19,741 --> 01:18:22,577
Come on, Chappie. We need
to get out of here. Come on.

1212
01:18:23,244 --> 01:18:26,039
Now, Chappie. Come on. Let's go.

1213
01:18:26,539 --> 01:18:27,957
Where is this? What is it?

1214
01:18:33,797 --> 01:18:34,881
What's this guy?

1215
01:18:35,048 --> 01:18:37,217
A failed version of you. A police robot.

1216
01:18:37,384 --> 01:18:39,052
Come on, let's go!

1217
01:18:40,261 --> 01:18:42,347
What's that? What are these?

1218
01:18:42,514 --> 01:18:45,475
Helmets worn by a human
who controls that horrid thing.

1219
01:18:45,642 --> 01:18:46,685
It reads their mind.

1220
01:18:47,268 --> 01:18:50,313
Doesn't have its own brain, that robot.
Not like you.

1221
01:18:53,983 --> 01:18:56,820
- These can read a brain?
- Yeah, a neural transmitter.

1222
01:18:56,986 --> 01:18:59,072
- Come on!
- But I want to...

1223
01:19:00,699 --> 01:19:02,033
Come on.

1224
01:19:03,576 --> 01:19:05,036
Chappie.

1225
01:19:14,212 --> 01:19:16,423
Deon. Deon.

1226
01:19:17,007 --> 01:19:18,174
This can save me.

1227
01:19:19,384 --> 01:19:22,220
- I need a new bodies, remember?
- No.

1228
01:19:23,304 --> 01:19:24,973
It can't save you, Chappie.

1229
01:19:25,140 --> 01:19:27,684
The problem is much greater
than your battery.

1230
01:19:27,851 --> 01:19:28,852
Why?

1231
01:19:29,019 --> 01:19:31,438
Because you are conscious.

1232
01:19:31,980 --> 01:19:34,441
You cannot be copied
because you're not data.

1233
01:19:34,607 --> 01:19:36,901
We don't know what consciousness is...

1234
01:19:37,068 --> 01:19:38,695
...so we cannot move it.

1235
01:19:41,114 --> 01:19:42,907
Chappie can figure it.

1236
01:19:43,074 --> 01:19:45,326
I can know what it is,
then I can move me.

1237
01:19:45,493 --> 01:19:47,078
You can't move it. I'm sorry.

1238
01:19:47,245 --> 01:19:50,165
We need to get out of here.
It's dangerous. Come on!

1239
01:19:50,331 --> 01:19:54,002
You said to me I mustn't let anybody say
that I can't do something.

1240
01:19:54,169 --> 01:19:57,797
Daddy has a man that can get me
the bodies for the monies.

1241
01:19:57,964 --> 01:19:59,632
What? Excuse me?

1242
01:19:59,799 --> 01:20:01,551
Daddy loves me, Deon!

1243
01:20:02,344 --> 01:20:03,470
I hate you!

1244
01:20:03,636 --> 01:20:05,305
I hate you! Go away.

1245
01:20:06,181 --> 01:20:08,058
Have to get my consciousness out.

1246
01:20:08,224 --> 01:20:09,893
Daddy'll get me the bodies...

1247
01:20:10,060 --> 01:20:13,938
...then I have to get my consciousness
out of here and into there.

1248
01:20:14,606 --> 01:20:16,649
- The helmet!
- No. What are you doing?

1249
01:20:16,816 --> 01:20:19,402
- I can use this.
- Put that back. Leave it alone.

1250
01:20:19,569 --> 01:20:22,364
- Put that down. It's illegal!
- I'm gonna take it! No.

1251
01:20:22,530 --> 01:20:25,325
- Chappie. Chappie, wait!
- I'm taking it!

1252
01:20:25,492 --> 01:20:27,535
- No! Chappie, wait!
- I'm taking it!

1253
01:20:27,702 --> 01:20:28,703
Please!

1254
01:20:29,996 --> 01:20:31,373
Chappie!

1255
01:20:32,457 --> 01:20:33,917
Chappie!

1256
01:20:53,561 --> 01:20:54,562
Damn it.

1257
01:21:03,530 --> 01:21:05,240
Move on in. Check the area.

1258
01:21:05,949 --> 01:21:09,661
Go all the way down.
Make sure we look in every room.

1259
01:21:10,787 --> 01:21:12,038
All the way down.

1260
01:21:12,205 --> 01:21:13,707
Sweep all the way back.

1261
01:21:27,887 --> 01:21:29,931
Chappie! Oh, thank God!

1262
01:21:30,098 --> 01:21:31,516
Chappie, are you okay?

1263
01:21:31,683 --> 01:21:33,101
<i>Ja,</i>Mommy, I'm fine.

1264
01:21:33,268 --> 01:21:34,686
What's that thing?

1265
01:21:34,853 --> 01:21:37,105
It's just a neural helmet, Mommy.

1266
01:21:37,272 --> 01:21:38,273
What?

1267
01:21:50,493 --> 01:21:51,536
Chappie.

1268
01:21:51,703 --> 01:21:53,038
What are you doing?

1269
01:21:53,204 --> 01:21:56,541
- I'm doing experiment, Mommy.
- What's all this stuff?

1270
01:21:57,292 --> 01:21:58,793
What's this thing?

1271
01:22:01,379 --> 01:22:03,548
I'll show you. Sit down.

1272
01:22:03,715 --> 01:22:04,883
Okay.

1273
01:22:05,050 --> 01:22:06,217
- Sit.
- Okay.

1274
01:22:06,384 --> 01:22:07,510
Okay, Mommy.

1275
01:22:07,677 --> 01:22:09,262
- Is it gonna hurt?
- No.

1276
01:22:09,429 --> 01:22:12,307
- Okay.
- Okay. Putting it on.

1277
01:22:12,474 --> 01:22:13,683
Okay.

1278
01:22:16,478 --> 01:22:18,104
Okay. Now what?

1279
01:22:18,271 --> 01:22:19,773
Consciousness is like energy.

1280
01:22:19,939 --> 01:22:22,525
This helmet reads the energy
from you and me.

1281
01:22:22,692 --> 01:22:24,694
I need to figure out
how to get it out.

1282
01:22:24,861 --> 01:22:28,365
All the information I need
to help me is on the Internet.

1283
01:22:31,743 --> 01:22:32,869
<i>There's books...</i>

1284
01:22:33,036 --> 01:22:35,080
...mathematical equations,
schematics...

1285
01:22:35,246 --> 01:22:38,875
...all the information that human beings
have ever had, all here.

1286
01:22:39,042 --> 01:22:40,877
- Sorry. Sorry.
- Deon!

1287
01:22:41,044 --> 01:22:42,045
Hello.

1288
01:22:42,212 --> 01:22:45,840
Get to your goddamn desk
and figure out what the hell is going on.

1289
01:22:46,007 --> 01:22:47,258
Yes, ma'am.

1290
01:22:48,259 --> 01:22:51,262
Listen. There'll be 300 homicides
in the city tonight...

1291
01:22:51,429 --> 01:22:53,723
...unless your faulty droids
go back online.

1292
01:22:53,890 --> 01:22:56,393
Get me?
This whole company could go under.

1293
01:22:58,478 --> 01:23:00,772
Good work, people.

1294
01:23:00,939 --> 01:23:03,066
Little snafu.
We're taking care of this.

1295
01:23:03,233 --> 01:23:05,610
The Scout model has failed.
Send the Moose in.

1296
01:23:05,777 --> 01:23:08,279
- Show people what it can do.
- Not now, Vincent.

1297
01:23:08,446 --> 01:23:10,115
The city's tearing itself apart.

1298
01:23:10,281 --> 01:23:13,034
Whole thing's going tits up.
We have to take control.

1299
01:23:13,201 --> 01:23:16,413
I said, no. And that's the end of it.

1300
01:23:17,038 --> 01:23:20,291
Hello, gentlemen.
I know, it's been a tough night.

1301
01:23:23,670 --> 01:23:25,130
Daddy get me a new bodies.

1302
01:23:25,296 --> 01:23:29,592
Daddy's gonna get new bodies,
and I just have to get this out.

1303
01:23:29,759 --> 01:23:31,803
I have to get my consciousness out.

1304
01:24:21,644 --> 01:24:22,937
That's it.

1305
01:24:26,983 --> 01:24:28,109
That's me.

1306
01:24:37,952 --> 01:24:40,330
It's time to pump up the jam.

1307
01:24:42,415 --> 01:24:44,834
I know what consciousness is.

1308
01:24:45,418 --> 01:24:46,503
That's nice.

1309
01:24:46,670 --> 01:24:48,380
This helmet can read it.

1310
01:24:49,798 --> 01:24:53,301
All I need is monies from the heist
for my new body.

1311
01:24:53,468 --> 01:24:55,387
That's right, motherfucker.

1312
01:24:55,553 --> 01:24:56,721
Come.

1313
01:24:57,972 --> 01:25:00,475
- Let's go.
- I solved it, Daddy.

1314
01:25:39,639 --> 01:25:40,640
Go!

1315
01:25:43,685 --> 01:25:46,354
- I see one!
- These guys need to sleep, Chappie.

1316
01:25:46,521 --> 01:25:47,856
Sleep, guy!

1317
01:25:48,523 --> 01:25:50,025
Here comes the boom!

1318
01:25:50,734 --> 01:25:52,193
Hit it, hit it, hit it!

1319
01:25:52,360 --> 01:25:54,946
- Go, Chappie. Go!
- Get the money! Get the money!

1320
01:25:55,613 --> 01:25:57,657
- You, out!
- Make him sleep, Chappie!

1321
01:25:57,824 --> 01:26:00,827
- Make him sleep!
- Good night! Sleep!

1322
01:26:01,786 --> 01:26:03,872
- You go sleepy-weepy.
- Get in, Chappie.

1323
01:26:04,039 --> 01:26:05,373
Come on, Chappie!

1324
01:26:32,776 --> 01:26:34,611
Do you realize what you've done?

1325
01:26:38,490 --> 01:26:39,491
<i>Good God.</i>

1326
01:26:39,657 --> 01:26:42,494
<i>If I'm seeing these images correctly...</i>

1327
01:26:42,660 --> 01:26:46,414
<i>...it looks like the police droids have
now begun helping the criminals.</i>

1328
01:26:46,581 --> 01:26:48,667
- Chappie.
- <i>We are trying to contact...</i>

1329
01:26:48,833 --> 01:26:51,419
- Got the second one!
- There's one more. Get it.

1330
01:26:51,586 --> 01:26:53,505
- Good, Chappie, good.
- You can sleep.

1331
01:26:53,672 --> 01:26:56,174
- You can sleep.
- Come on, Chappie. Go, go, go!

1332
01:26:56,341 --> 01:26:59,886
<i>Three suspects are robbing an
armored car with what appears to be...</i>

1333
01:27:00,053 --> 01:27:03,056
<i>- ...the help of a Scout police robot.</i>
- Oh, no.

1334
01:27:05,100 --> 01:27:08,353
You will not get away with this.
Everyone will know!

1335
01:27:13,775 --> 01:27:16,736
Let's go! Let's go! That's three.
Chappie, let's go!

1336
01:27:17,946 --> 01:27:19,447
Please.

1337
01:27:19,614 --> 01:27:22,534
- Chappie, what are you doing?
- What's the matter?

1338
01:27:22,701 --> 01:27:24,536
Ninja, grab the bag. Let's go!

1339
01:27:26,246 --> 01:27:27,914
Are you sleepy?

1340
01:27:28,540 --> 01:27:29,958
Chappie, come on!

1341
01:27:30,125 --> 01:27:32,877
- Please don't hurt me.
- Chappie, get in the van!

1342
01:27:33,420 --> 01:27:35,005
- Chappie!
- Let's go.

1343
01:27:35,171 --> 01:27:36,506
You can sleep now.

1344
01:27:37,007 --> 01:27:38,633
You can sleep.

1345
01:27:40,176 --> 01:27:41,761
Please let me live.

1346
01:27:44,055 --> 01:27:46,016
Chappie!

1347
01:27:46,683 --> 01:27:47,684
I'm sorry.

1348
01:27:49,519 --> 01:27:52,480
Come on! Come on, boy! Let's get in.

1349
01:27:54,232 --> 01:27:56,067
I thought you were gonna sleep!

1350
01:27:56,943 --> 01:27:58,737
Can I talk to you in private?

1351
01:28:00,572 --> 01:28:02,866
Could you give us a moment, please?

1352
01:28:05,660 --> 01:28:06,911
Thank you.

1353
01:28:08,663 --> 01:28:11,624
Oh, God.
This is certainly a fuck-up.

1354
01:28:11,791 --> 01:28:14,336
Ma'am, listen.
This is the work of Deon.

1355
01:28:14,502 --> 01:28:17,672
It's the work of some rogue program
that he's been writing...

1356
01:28:17,839 --> 01:28:20,675
...and last night
he brought a droid in here...

1357
01:28:20,842 --> 01:28:22,218
...and it was sentient.

1358
01:28:24,971 --> 01:28:26,973
And have you seen this?
Do you know?

1359
01:28:27,140 --> 01:28:30,018
It's committing crimes, the monster.
Look at that.

1360
01:28:30,185 --> 01:28:32,687
<i>The Scout model
is nearly indestructible.</i>

1361
01:28:33,271 --> 01:28:34,522
I told him no!

1362
01:28:34,689 --> 01:28:38,151
Okay. That's a lot worse
than just failing to work.

1363
01:28:38,318 --> 01:28:42,447
So let's use this situation
to make a certain other robot shine.

1364
01:28:42,614 --> 01:28:44,532
This thing has gotta be destroyed...

1365
01:28:44,699 --> 01:28:47,619
...crushed before it does
any more damage, and Deon...

1366
01:28:47,786 --> 01:28:49,120
Deon's gotta be removed.

1367
01:28:49,579 --> 01:28:52,457
He has cost this company dearly.
And your reputation.

1368
01:28:52,624 --> 01:28:55,251
You do not want this
to be your legacy.

1369
01:28:59,214 --> 01:29:00,924
Do it.

1370
01:29:01,091 --> 01:29:03,718
- Destroy that robot.
- Thank you, ma'am.

1371
01:29:03,885 --> 01:29:06,179
- Burn it to ash.
- Thank you.

1372
01:29:07,764 --> 01:29:08,932
People...

1373
01:29:09,099 --> 01:29:10,975
...this is Michelle Bradley.

1374
01:29:11,142 --> 01:29:13,645
<i>I authorize the launch of the Moose.</i>

1375
01:29:13,812 --> 01:29:17,107
<i>Repeat: I authorize the launch
of the Moose.</i>

1376
01:29:18,066 --> 01:29:19,984
Move it out! Clear the deck!

1377
01:29:20,610 --> 01:29:22,946
Move it out! Let's move!
Move! Now!

1378
01:29:23,113 --> 01:29:26,366
<i>Moose launch
in T-minus five minutes.</i>

1379
01:29:49,264 --> 01:29:51,016
Come on, get out of here.

1380
01:29:55,061 --> 01:29:56,438
You motherfucker.

1381
01:29:57,188 --> 01:29:59,232
I want that robot.

1382
01:29:59,983 --> 01:30:01,026
Go!

1383
01:30:01,192 --> 01:30:03,236
Everyone out! Go!
Move! Move! Move!

1384
01:30:03,403 --> 01:30:04,904
Go! Go! Go!

1385
01:30:34,934 --> 01:30:36,102
Let's go!

1386
01:30:48,782 --> 01:30:50,658
Yippee-ki-yay, motherfuckers!

1387
01:30:50,825 --> 01:30:52,660
I'm going home! I'm going home!

1388
01:30:52,827 --> 01:30:54,829
Daddy, can we go
and get my new body...

1389
01:30:54,996 --> 01:30:57,123
...from your friend with the fresh one?

1390
01:30:57,290 --> 01:30:58,291
Daddy, we go now?

1391
01:30:58,458 --> 01:31:02,170
I'm sorry, man,
but there is no new bodies.

1392
01:31:02,337 --> 01:31:04,130
I'm sorry, Chappie. I swear.

1393
01:31:04,297 --> 01:31:07,926
What do you mean, no new bodies?
Daddy, we've got the monies.

1394
01:31:08,093 --> 01:31:09,969
I needed your help with the heist.

1395
01:31:10,929 --> 01:31:12,597
You lied to me.

1396
01:31:13,640 --> 01:31:14,808
You lied to me, Daddy!

1397
01:31:14,974 --> 01:31:18,478
Just relax, Chappie. At the time
you were different and, like....

1398
01:31:20,230 --> 01:31:21,439
You lied to me, Daddy!

1399
01:31:21,606 --> 01:31:23,108
- Chappie.
- You lied!

1400
01:31:23,274 --> 01:31:25,777
- Why you lie to me?! Why?!
- No! Stop, Chappie!

1401
01:31:34,494 --> 01:31:36,121
I'm coming to get you, Deon.

1402
01:31:38,373 --> 01:31:41,251
Come on. Come on.
Come on, come on, come on!

1403
01:31:49,634 --> 01:31:52,137
- Why, Daddy?!
- No, Chappie! Chappie, stop it!

1404
01:31:52,303 --> 01:31:54,764
Leave me, Amerika! You lied to me!

1405
01:31:54,931 --> 01:31:56,307
- Chappie!
- Chappie, no!

1406
01:31:56,474 --> 01:31:58,601
- No, Chappie! No!
- You lie, Daddy!

1407
01:31:58,768 --> 01:32:01,021
You were gonna let me die, Daddy!

1408
01:32:01,187 --> 01:32:03,023
You were gonna let me die!

1409
01:32:03,648 --> 01:32:05,316
Why you humans do this?!

1410
01:32:05,483 --> 01:32:06,776
Why you all lie?!

1411
01:32:06,943 --> 01:32:09,946
We can find a way, Chappie.
I'm sorry, my boy.

1412
01:32:10,113 --> 01:32:11,239
I swear, I'm sorry.

1413
01:32:11,406 --> 01:32:13,408
Chappie, listen,
I know how you feel...

1414
01:32:13,575 --> 01:32:16,995
...but there's something headed
our way now, coming to hurt you.

1415
01:32:17,162 --> 01:32:18,663
- What?
- No time to explain.

1416
01:32:18,830 --> 01:32:22,834
When this thing gets here, it'll stop
at nothing until you're gone, Chappie.

1417
01:32:23,001 --> 01:32:24,419
What are you talking about?

1418
01:32:29,549 --> 01:32:31,926
No. No, Deon.

1419
01:32:34,888 --> 01:32:38,266
I'm going anyways.
My battery's gonna finish.

1420
01:32:38,433 --> 01:32:40,685
No, Chappie! No!

1421
01:32:41,186 --> 01:32:43,396
We'll find a way, Chappie.

1422
01:32:43,563 --> 01:32:44,731
I'm going, Mommy.

1423
01:32:48,068 --> 01:32:49,819
Get back! Back up, back up!

1424
01:32:50,820 --> 01:32:52,155
Yeah, man!

1425
01:32:53,448 --> 01:32:54,449
I'm here...

1426
01:32:55,617 --> 01:32:58,078
...for my fucking money, Ninja!

1427
01:32:58,244 --> 01:33:00,080
I don't just want my 20 million.

1428
01:33:00,246 --> 01:33:01,414
He's here to kill us.

1429
01:33:01,873 --> 01:33:03,458
I want your robot.

1430
01:33:03,625 --> 01:33:04,918
I want everything!

1431
01:33:05,085 --> 01:33:06,086
Fuck this shit!

1432
01:33:18,014 --> 01:33:19,307
Chappie, do something!

1433
01:33:25,689 --> 01:33:27,649
Chappie, help us!

1434
01:34:09,691 --> 01:34:11,985
That just tickles, boys.
That just tickles.

1435
01:34:17,115 --> 01:34:19,617
Amerika!

1436
01:34:31,338 --> 01:34:32,714
Come on, little gangster.

1437
01:34:40,638 --> 01:34:41,639
That's it.

1438
01:34:42,515 --> 01:34:43,767
That's my money!

1439
01:34:50,940 --> 01:34:52,567
Yep. Fly up, fly up, fly up.

1440
01:34:55,528 --> 01:34:56,780
No! Stop!

1441
01:35:00,867 --> 01:35:02,577
- Come on!
- My bag! My bag!

1442
01:35:02,744 --> 01:35:06,831
I'm gonna finish you off.
Every single pathetic scum lot of you.

1443
01:35:16,007 --> 01:35:17,008
Ninja!

1444
01:35:17,884 --> 01:35:18,885
Fuck!

1445
01:35:19,052 --> 01:35:21,680
Jesus, dude! Get out of way!

1446
01:35:21,846 --> 01:35:23,848
How about a cluster bomb?

1447
01:35:31,022 --> 01:35:32,982
Move out of the way!

1448
01:35:47,914 --> 01:35:49,416
This is too good.

1449
01:35:54,254 --> 01:35:55,255
Here we go.

1450
01:36:03,430 --> 01:36:05,223
No!

1451
01:36:26,578 --> 01:36:27,579
Fuck mother!

1452
01:36:30,540 --> 01:36:31,958
Bugger!

1453
01:36:33,084 --> 01:36:35,211
You! I'm gonna kill you!

1454
01:36:39,174 --> 01:36:40,175
Hey, hey, hey!

1455
01:36:50,477 --> 01:36:51,519
Chappie!

1456
01:37:02,655 --> 01:37:04,532
Let's go! Let's go!

1457
01:37:06,117 --> 01:37:07,535
No, Mommy!

1458
01:37:11,748 --> 01:37:12,749
Inside, Mommy!

1459
01:37:15,919 --> 01:37:17,420
What's going on? I can't see.

1460
01:37:24,135 --> 01:37:25,804
Get in the car, maker!

1461
01:37:25,970 --> 01:37:27,138
Hey, hey, hey!

1462
01:37:27,305 --> 01:37:28,473
Hey, <i>baba</i>.

1463
01:37:30,892 --> 01:37:32,352
I want that truck!

1464
01:37:33,687 --> 01:37:36,106
Hey, hey! Get out! Out!

1465
01:37:37,273 --> 01:37:39,317
Run, Deon, go!

1466
01:38:02,757 --> 01:38:04,217
Chappie!

1467
01:38:06,261 --> 01:38:09,180
No! Maker! Maker!

1468
01:38:12,017 --> 01:38:13,268
It's okay.

1469
01:38:16,354 --> 01:38:17,981
Go, go, go! Come on!

1470
01:38:18,148 --> 01:38:20,275
Backup visuals. Infrared.

1471
01:38:21,776 --> 01:38:25,196
You'll be okay. I've solved it!
We'll get your consciousness out.

1472
01:38:26,823 --> 01:38:27,991
Yo-Landi!

1473
01:38:36,332 --> 01:38:38,168
Stop here, Daddy! Stop!

1474
01:38:38,835 --> 01:38:41,338
- What are you doing?
- Getting the neural helmet!

1475
01:38:41,755 --> 01:38:43,381
I'm coming for you now, mate.

1476
01:39:01,691 --> 01:39:04,277
My helmet. My helmet.

1477
01:39:05,737 --> 01:39:08,323
Ninja. Ninja.

1478
01:39:09,449 --> 01:39:10,867
Ninja, get back! Get back!

1479
01:39:11,034 --> 01:39:14,120
I have to get my maker
to that other helmet at the factory!

1480
01:39:14,287 --> 01:39:15,538
My helmet's broken!

1481
01:39:15,705 --> 01:39:18,583
I'm gonna draw this thing away from us.
Okay. Take her!

1482
01:39:18,750 --> 01:39:21,294
- No! No, Ninja!
- Go, Chappie!

1483
01:39:21,461 --> 01:39:23,296
- Go!
- Ninja, don't leave me!

1484
01:39:24,464 --> 01:39:26,633
- Ninja!
- Hey!

1485
01:39:26,800 --> 01:39:28,343
Hey, <i>poes!</i>

1486
01:39:34,641 --> 01:39:36,309
Who's that?

1487
01:39:36,810 --> 01:39:38,812
Oh, my gosh, look at you.

1488
01:39:38,978 --> 01:39:40,480
You think you're a hero.

1489
01:40:03,628 --> 01:40:04,879
- Ninja!
- No, Mommy!

1490
01:40:05,046 --> 01:40:07,007
What you doing? What you doing?!

1491
01:40:07,173 --> 01:40:10,260
Come on! Come! Come on, do it!

1492
01:40:13,722 --> 01:40:14,764
Come on!

1493
01:40:16,641 --> 01:40:18,518
Do it!

1494
01:40:24,858 --> 01:40:26,026
Do it!

1495
01:40:26,192 --> 01:40:28,862
Do it!

1496
01:40:53,470 --> 01:40:55,305
No, Mommy! Mommy!

1497
01:40:55,472 --> 01:40:56,765
Mommy, please.

1498
01:40:56,931 --> 01:40:58,058
Please, Mommy.

1499
01:41:00,852 --> 01:41:02,437
This is your day of reckoning.

1500
01:41:21,790 --> 01:41:23,124
What the hell's going on?

1501
01:41:24,793 --> 01:41:26,211
Come back. Come back.

1502
01:41:28,088 --> 01:41:29,464
No, no, no. Impossible.

1503
01:41:45,689 --> 01:41:48,358
Wake up, Mommy! Mommy, please!

1504
01:41:57,867 --> 01:41:59,119
Mommy?

1505
01:42:07,252 --> 01:42:08,670
Come here.

1506
01:42:24,769 --> 01:42:27,522
Maker! Maker, who did this to Mommy?

1507
01:42:28,064 --> 01:42:29,274
I know who.

1508
01:42:29,441 --> 01:42:32,610
I hate him! Why?!
Why do they do the hurtings?!

1509
01:42:33,194 --> 01:42:34,654
I'm gonna crush him!

1510
01:42:34,821 --> 01:42:37,866
Daddy, stay there!
Chappie's gonna crush the man!

1511
01:42:58,928 --> 01:42:59,929
Chappie.

1512
01:43:13,026 --> 01:43:14,235
You!

1513
01:43:14,819 --> 01:43:16,112
The man from the van!

1514
01:43:19,616 --> 01:43:22,827
Wait here. I'm gonna get
the bad man from the van!

1515
01:43:31,336 --> 01:43:33,546
You godless freak! Godless!

1516
01:43:36,925 --> 01:43:38,551
You killed Mommy!

1517
01:43:38,718 --> 01:43:40,428
You hurt my peoples! Why?!

1518
01:43:42,681 --> 01:43:45,058
No. You don't use guns.

1519
01:43:50,105 --> 01:43:51,981
I'm gonna crush you, bad man!

1520
01:43:52,148 --> 01:43:55,360
I'm gonna crush you
for hurting my mommy!

1521
01:44:02,033 --> 01:44:03,576
No shooting with the arm.

1522
01:44:06,705 --> 01:44:07,747
No hurtings!

1523
01:44:07,914 --> 01:44:10,291
No violence!

1524
01:44:15,130 --> 01:44:17,257
I'm gonna teach you a lesson.

1525
01:44:21,428 --> 01:44:23,930
You are a very bad man.

1526
01:44:32,564 --> 01:44:35,400
Now I forgive you, bad man.

1527
01:44:53,835 --> 01:44:55,086
You're gonna be okay.

1528
01:44:55,253 --> 01:44:56,379
Wait.

1529
01:45:03,261 --> 01:45:04,888
Don't go to sleep, Deon.

1530
01:45:05,055 --> 01:45:06,556
Don't go to the next place.

1531
01:45:06,723 --> 01:45:08,058
Get in the chair.

1532
01:45:08,224 --> 01:45:09,559
Please, quickly.

1533
01:45:13,188 --> 01:45:14,189
Chappie.

1534
01:45:16,900 --> 01:45:18,360
<i>Ja</i>, what?

1535
01:45:20,028 --> 01:45:22,072
There's a problem. Look.

1536
01:45:22,530 --> 01:45:25,200
- There's only one droid.
- Let me get your new body.

1537
01:45:25,700 --> 01:45:29,079
For chrissake, Chappie,
just save yourself.

1538
01:45:44,928 --> 01:45:46,471
No, no, no. Maker.

1539
01:45:47,722 --> 01:45:49,641
Maker, you're gonna be okay.

1540
01:45:49,808 --> 01:45:51,518
You have to be tough.

1541
01:45:51,685 --> 01:45:52,936
You be tough.

1542
01:45:58,024 --> 01:46:00,360
It's gonna be okay.
Stay with me, Deon.

1543
01:46:01,778 --> 01:46:03,488
The police are here now.

1544
01:46:06,074 --> 01:46:07,075
Okay, you ready?

1545
01:46:18,837 --> 01:46:19,879
Please work.

1546
01:46:21,339 --> 01:46:22,590
Get it open. Come on.

1547
01:46:35,770 --> 01:46:39,691
Maker, please take it slow. This will be
very disorientating for a human.

1548
01:46:43,069 --> 01:46:45,613
My God. I'm....

1549
01:46:46,948 --> 01:46:48,199
This isn't working.

1550
01:46:48,366 --> 01:46:50,744
Do you have an angle grinder
or something?

1551
01:46:50,910 --> 01:46:52,746
Are you okay, maker?

1552
01:46:59,627 --> 01:47:01,796
Maker? Do you have pain?

1553
01:47:03,465 --> 01:47:06,509
No, Chappie. I'm... I'm alive.

1554
01:47:13,391 --> 01:47:14,893
I don't know what this means.

1555
01:47:15,602 --> 01:47:17,062
You will live forever.

1556
01:47:22,233 --> 01:47:25,070
Chappie. We have to help you now.

1557
01:47:25,236 --> 01:47:27,113
Think, damn it. Think.

1558
01:47:27,280 --> 01:47:29,574
It's okay, maker. You got saved.

1559
01:47:30,450 --> 01:47:32,494
And there's no more bodies.

1560
01:47:35,163 --> 01:47:37,374
No, Chappie. Wait. I know!

1561
01:47:37,540 --> 01:47:39,501
Vincent uploaded his program here.

1562
01:47:39,668 --> 01:47:42,754
There are hundreds of bodies
all over the city. Here it is!

1563
01:47:45,757 --> 01:47:47,217
Hurry! Plug that in.

1564
01:47:50,095 --> 01:47:52,847
Vincent set up a way
to remotely deactivate droids.

1565
01:47:53,014 --> 01:47:55,266
We can use it
to move you to a new body.

1566
01:47:55,433 --> 01:47:57,811
- Find the closest Scout. Quickly!
- Okay! Okay!

1567
01:47:57,977 --> 01:47:59,396
I'm going quickly!

1568
01:48:00,730 --> 01:48:01,815
I can do it.

1569
01:48:06,486 --> 01:48:08,154
- Deon.
- Yes.

1570
01:48:08,321 --> 01:48:11,116
- Press "Enter" when I say.
- Okay. Okay.

1571
01:48:17,580 --> 01:48:18,873
Come on, Chappie.

1572
01:48:20,625 --> 01:48:21,668
Maker.

1573
01:48:25,338 --> 01:48:27,757
I'm scared. What if it doesn't work?

1574
01:48:29,092 --> 01:48:30,885
It's going to work, Chappie.

1575
01:48:31,052 --> 01:48:34,180
- I promise.
- And you can never break a promise.

1576
01:48:34,347 --> 01:48:36,558
- Come on. Let's do this.
- Okay.

1577
01:48:36,725 --> 01:48:37,809
Okay.

1578
01:48:39,019 --> 01:48:40,103
Here goes.

1579
01:48:41,771 --> 01:48:43,398
Chappie goes in the new body.

1580
01:49:08,298 --> 01:49:11,217
Let's go, boys! Tetravaal, stay back!
Now, boys, go!

1581
01:49:41,748 --> 01:49:43,208
Chappie?

1582
01:49:44,959 --> 01:49:46,002
Is that you?

1583
01:49:46,169 --> 01:49:47,420
<i>Ja</i>, it's me.

1584
01:49:47,587 --> 01:49:48,922
It worked.

1585
01:49:49,089 --> 01:49:50,965
We both have new bodies now.

1586
01:49:51,549 --> 01:49:52,926
Thank you.

1587
01:49:53,885 --> 01:49:56,304
I'm sorry you had
to leave your other body.

1588
01:49:56,471 --> 01:49:58,390
But it was the only way to save you.

1589
01:49:59,432 --> 01:50:00,892
Come, maker. Come quickly.

1590
01:50:01,643 --> 01:50:03,436
We're going back home!

1591
01:50:38,596 --> 01:50:41,307
<i>- Okay, Mommy? Think of something.
- Okay, thinking.</i>

1592
01:50:44,519 --> 01:50:45,520
Is it Daddy?

1593
01:50:46,104 --> 01:50:47,313
Yeah.

1594
01:50:48,231 --> 01:50:49,733
It's working, Mommy.

1595
01:50:49,899 --> 01:50:51,192
It's working!

1596
01:51:29,064 --> 01:51:31,316
It's just a temporary body, Mommy.

1597
01:51:31,983 --> 01:51:33,777
I'll make you a new one.

1598
01:51:33,943 --> 01:51:36,696
You don't have to go
to the next place.

1599
01:51:41,201 --> 01:51:44,120
<i>South African authorities
placed an immediate halt...</i>

1600
01:51:44,287 --> 01:51:47,582
<i>...on the use of any robotic element
of law enforcement...</i>

1601
01:51:47,749 --> 01:51:53,463
<i>...and have activated
150,000 reserve human forces.</i>

1602
01:51:53,630 --> 01:51:56,383
<i>In Johannesburg,
there have been several sightings...</i>

1603
01:51:56,549 --> 01:51:59,260
<i>...of the presumed deactivated robot,
Chappie.</i>

1604
01:51:59,427 --> 01:52:02,013
<i>The police ask viewers
who have seen Chappie...</i>

1605
01:52:02,180 --> 01:52:03,598
<i>...to please come forward.</i>

1606
01:52:03,765 --> 01:52:06,017
<i>We'll have more on this
as it develops.</i>

1607
01:52:39,092 --> 01:52:41,052
I'll see you soon, Mommy.

1608
01:52:57,610 --> 01:52:59,830
Now we are both black sheeps,
Mommy.

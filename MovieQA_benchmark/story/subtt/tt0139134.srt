1
00:02:34,417 --> 00:02:39,923
Sebastian...
Let's try and focus.

2
00:02:40,088 --> 00:02:43,926
What can I say?
I'm a fool.

3
00:02:44,134 --> 00:02:50,766
- You're not a fool.
- I am, A poor little rich boy.

4
00:02:50,974 --> 00:02:55,854
It's not your fault.
Adolescence is a difficult time.

5
00:02:56,063 --> 00:02:59,734
Without great parenting,
things can go awry.

6
00:02:59,942 --> 00:03:05,698
But you have to rise above
their mistakes, Here.

7
00:03:08,909 --> 00:03:14,331
- An autographed copy, For me?
- It's yours.

8
00:03:15,207 --> 00:03:20,546
Stop being so hard on yourself.
What's in the past is over.

9
00:03:20,754 --> 00:03:22,924
You're right.

10
00:03:23,132 --> 00:03:28,805
It's hard to believe there was a
time when I only thought about sex.

11
00:03:29,013 --> 00:03:32,182
It's no way to go through life.

12
00:03:32,391 --> 00:03:35,562
Take yourself, for example.

13
00:03:35,728 --> 00:03:40,024
You're a very attractive woman.
You have killer legs.

14
00:03:40,191 --> 00:03:45,195
I'd love to photograph them...
That was the old me.

15
00:03:45,405 --> 00:03:52,120
I'm cured now.
Same time next week?

16
00:03:52,287 --> 00:03:56,331
I'm going on my book tour.
I'll be back in a month.

17
00:03:56,540 --> 00:04:00,336
- Why?
- Other people need my help, too.

18
00:04:00,544 --> 00:04:04,841
- You'll do just fine.
- I hope so.

19
00:04:05,008 --> 00:04:08,427
If you need anything, just call.

20
00:04:08,635 --> 00:04:12,098
I could use a hug.

21
00:04:19,939 --> 00:04:23,192
All right... There you go.

22
00:04:29,031 --> 00:04:32,951
- Your daughter on 1.
- Tell her to hold.

23
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:41,168
- Is this her? She seems nice.
- She's great, Straight-A student.

24
00:04:41,377 --> 00:04:46,257
She's attending Princeton this fall.

25
00:04:46,466 --> 00:04:49,843
She's the type of girl
I should be with.

26
00:04:50,052 --> 00:04:53,680
She's a little out of your league.

27
00:04:55,182 --> 00:05:02,064
- Take care of yourself, Sebastian.
- Thank you... for everything.

28
00:05:03,858 --> 00:05:05,985
Shmuck.

29
00:05:12,199 --> 00:05:16,120
- Yes?
- Your daughter's still holding.

30
00:05:16,329 --> 00:05:21,834
- Hi, honey.
- You kept me on hold.

31
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,255
He told me he loved me,
and I believed him.

32
00:05:27,464 --> 00:05:32,177
- I'm so stupid.
- It's all right.

33
00:05:32,386 --> 00:05:35,889
Take a deep breath,
step out of the circle.

34
00:05:36,098 --> 00:05:40,978
Cut the psycho-babble bullshit, Mom!

35
00:05:41,187 --> 00:05:44,356
There's pictures of me
on the lnternet.

36
00:05:44,524 --> 00:05:50,278
- What kind of pictures?
- Nudie pictures! What do you think?

37
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:58,620
- How could you be so stupid?
- He was just so charming.

38
00:05:58,829 --> 00:06:02,290
He said I had killer legs, -

39
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:05,252
- and he wanted to photograph them.

40
00:06:05,461 --> 00:06:10,341
Things just got
completely out of hand.

41
00:06:12,134 --> 00:06:14,971
Mom... Are you there?

42
00:06:15,762 --> 00:06:19,100
Mom? Mother!

43
00:06:23,896 --> 00:06:26,356
Sebastian!

44
00:06:27,524 --> 00:06:31,069
You're going to pay for this,
you little shit!

45
00:06:31,278 --> 00:06:37,576
- You sicko! Pervert!
- What's her problem?

46
00:06:37,784 --> 00:06:41,454
Someone's in need of therapy.

47
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:45,418
You won't get away with this.
Get away!

48
00:06:46,711 --> 00:06:50,590
- What's your name?
- Clorissa.

49
00:06:50,798 --> 00:06:55,093
- Clorissa? God, you're beautiful.
- Thank you.

50
00:06:55,302 --> 00:06:58,930
- I'm going to take you to lunch.
- Okay.

51
00:07:21,954 --> 00:07:24,956
There's no parking here, sir.

52
00:07:36,802 --> 00:07:41,848
We're so happy that Cecile will be
attending Manchester with you.

53
00:07:42,057 --> 00:07:45,226
You've been an inspiration to us.

54
00:07:45,394 --> 00:07:49,689
We hope she can rise to the
high standards you've set for her.

55
00:07:49,856 --> 00:07:52,942
I'll do my best.

56
00:07:53,985 --> 00:07:59,033
- What was that?
- "Thanks," Isn't Vietnamese lovely?

57
00:08:01,201 --> 00:08:07,375
Kathryn is very popular at school.
Listen to whatever she has to say and you'll go far.

58
00:08:07,583 --> 00:08:12,922
- Where do you get your strength?
- It sounds corny, but...

59
00:08:13,088 --> 00:08:20,678
When I'm tempted by peer pressure,
I turn to God, He helps me.

60
00:08:20,887 --> 00:08:26,476
- That's beautiful.
- What are the boys like?

61
00:08:26,644 --> 00:08:31,689
Cecile...
Is that all you can think of?

62
00:08:33,067 --> 00:08:38,905
Forgive her, She's never been in
a co-educational atmosphere before.

63
00:08:39,115 --> 00:08:45,037
It's understandable, Most boys
at Manchester are very upstanding.

64
00:08:45,245 --> 00:08:48,999
But there are a few bad apples.

65
00:08:49,207 --> 00:08:55,130
Like your stepbrother Sebastian.
What he did to the school nurse...

66
00:08:55,338 --> 00:08:58,926
I hear she's recovering quite well.

67
00:08:59,134 --> 00:09:03,264
Nice to see you again, Mrs Caldwell.

68
00:09:03,429 --> 00:09:09,937
- You remember my daughter Cecile?
- My, what an adorable shirt.

69
00:09:10,145 --> 00:09:13,399
My father took me to Australia.

70
00:09:13,606 --> 00:09:18,236
How are things down under?
Blossoming, I hope.

71
00:09:18,445 --> 00:09:21,365
What?

72
00:09:22,783 --> 00:09:26,995
- I'm so sorry...
- Well, thank you for your help.

73
00:09:27,203 --> 00:09:31,917
- I'll call about your curriculum.
- Okay, thanks.

74
00:09:32,125 --> 00:09:34,961
It was nice meeting you.

75
00:09:35,921 --> 00:09:41,134
Let's go, Keep your legs together.
This isn't Jamaica.

76
00:09:44,013 --> 00:09:47,349
I didn't know it was Asshole Day.

77
00:09:47,515 --> 00:09:52,395
I'm just taking the poor girl
under my wing.

78
00:09:54,023 --> 00:09:56,524
The parental units called.

79
00:09:56,734 --> 00:09:59,736
How's your whore of a mother
enjoying Bali?

80
00:09:59,903 --> 00:10:05,743
She suspects that your impotent,
alcoholic father is diddling the maid.

81
00:10:07,494 --> 00:10:12,041
- Therapy not going well?
- It was fine.

82
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,047
Clorissa, "Call me,"

83
00:10:18,212 --> 00:10:23,552
I'm sick of sleeping with these
insipid Manhattan debutantes.

84
00:10:23,719 --> 00:10:30,100
- Nothing shocks them anymore.
- Relax, I have a mission for you.

85
00:10:30,308 --> 00:10:37,357
- Remember Court Reynolds?
- The Nazi who dumped you July 4th?

86
00:10:37,566 --> 00:10:44,114
I went to great lengths to please
Court, I made huge sacrifices.

87
00:10:44,322 --> 00:10:49,745
My feelings were hurt when I learned
Court had fallen for someone else.

88
00:10:49,912 --> 00:10:54,040
- You don't mean,.?
- None other than Cecile Caldwell.

89
00:10:54,207 --> 00:10:57,461
So that's what this is all about.

90
00:10:57,628 --> 00:11:00,297
"Keep your enemies close,"

91
00:11:00,464 --> 00:11:05,259
When I'm done with Cecile, she'll
be the premier tramp of New York.

92
00:11:05,469 --> 00:11:08,221
Court's princess
will be damaged goods.

93
00:11:08,429 --> 00:11:16,312
- Why not just attack Court?
- That could be traced back to me.

94
00:11:16,522 --> 00:11:21,692
That won't do, Everyone loves me,
and I intend to keep it that way.

95
00:11:21,902 --> 00:11:26,115
I see your point.

96
00:11:27,825 --> 00:11:33,831
- Why should I care?
- You have to seduce young Cecile.

97
00:11:35,374 --> 00:11:38,376
She's quite cute, you know.

98
00:11:38,585 --> 00:11:42,004
Young, supple breasts.

99
00:11:42,213 --> 00:11:45,884
A tight, firm ass.

100
00:11:48,803 --> 00:11:51,889
Uncharted booty.

101
00:11:54,893 --> 00:12:00,566
Be her Captain Picard, Valmont.
Boldly go...

102
00:12:01,942 --> 00:12:05,361
where no man has gone before.

103
00:12:06,654 --> 00:12:09,408
I can't.

104
00:12:09,575 --> 00:12:14,037
- Why not?
- Come on, Kathryn, It's too easy.

105
00:12:14,245 --> 00:12:18,917
Get one of your moron friends to
do it, I've a reputation to uphold.

106
00:12:19,125 --> 00:12:23,422
- Diddling the therapist's daughter?
- She was overcharging.

107
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:29,302
This is a challenge.

108
00:12:30,721 --> 00:12:35,725
- I know all about menstrual cramps.
- Shut up and turn to page 64.

109
00:12:43,859 --> 00:12:47,988
"Why I plan to wait",
by Annette Hargrove, Kansas City.

110
00:12:51,115 --> 00:12:55,913
- Jesus Christ, is she for real?
- She's Daddy's little angel.

111
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:58,664
A paradigm of chastity.

112
00:13:00,583 --> 00:13:05,129
Let's see.
Boring, boring, boring...

113
00:13:05,339 --> 00:13:08,716
"I love my parents,"

114
00:13:08,926 --> 00:13:13,054
"Making a mature decision..."
Here!

115
00:13:13,263 --> 00:13:16,600
She has a boyfriend named Trevor.

116
00:13:16,767 --> 00:13:21,145
Going out for a year.
Trevor understands.

117
00:13:21,355 --> 00:13:25,149
Trevor's a fag.
Too bad she lives in Kansas.

118
00:13:25,359 --> 00:13:31,280
Au contraire, The virgin's father
is the new headmaster at our school.

119
00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:35,243
She's staying with my aunt
while her parents sell the house.

120
00:13:36,411 --> 00:13:40,374
Can you imagine what this will do
for my reputation?

121
00:13:40,581 --> 00:13:44,794
Screwing the new headmaster's
daughter before school starts.

122
00:13:45,003 --> 00:13:51,967
- She'll be my greatest victory.
- You don't stand a chance.

123
00:13:54,513 --> 00:14:00,018
- Care to make a wager?
- I'll think about it.

124
00:14:00,184 --> 00:14:05,315
Duty calls, Dr Greenbaum and her
daughter will be an exciting entry.

125
00:14:05,524 --> 00:14:08,943
Your journal...
Could you be more queer?

126
00:14:09,152 --> 00:14:13,532
Could you be more desperate
to read it?

127
00:14:21,206 --> 00:14:24,458
Sebastian...

128
00:14:24,668 --> 00:14:28,797
Could you come here for a second?

129
00:14:38,056 --> 00:14:42,601
About that little wager of yours...
Count me in.

130
00:14:43,979 --> 00:14:47,566
What are the terms?

131
00:14:47,774 --> 00:14:50,360
If I win...

132
00:14:50,568 --> 00:14:56,323
- Your hot little car is mine.
- And if I win?

133
00:14:56,490 --> 00:15:02,706
You'll get something you've wanted
since our parents got married.

134
00:15:02,913 --> 00:15:06,960
Be more specific.

135
00:15:07,126 --> 00:15:11,965
In English...
I'll fuck your brains out.

136
00:15:14,176 --> 00:15:19,264
What makes you think I'll go for it?
That's a 1956 Jaguar Roadster.

137
00:15:22,517 --> 00:15:26,480
Because I'm the only person
you can't have, and it kills you.

138
00:15:28,648 --> 00:15:31,192
No way.

139
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:34,571
You can put it anywhere.

140
00:15:39,576 --> 00:15:44,288
You got yourself a bet, baby.

141
00:15:48,043 --> 00:15:51,754
Happy hunting, Sebastian.

142
00:16:05,684 --> 00:16:09,355
Your home is beautiful,
Mrs Rosemond.

143
00:16:09,563 --> 00:16:13,025
It's been in my family
for over 100 years.

144
00:16:13,235 --> 00:16:19,157
- Does your family ride much?
- My grandpa used to break horses.

145
00:16:19,365 --> 00:16:22,284
- What was that?
- Sebastian must be home.

146
00:16:22,451 --> 00:16:25,538
Pull!

147
00:16:27,749 --> 00:16:32,544
- Sebastian!
- Fuck me...

148
00:16:32,754 --> 00:16:36,799
Aunt Helen!
God, I've missed you!

149
00:16:37,008 --> 00:16:40,845
I've been looking all over for you.

150
00:16:41,053 --> 00:16:46,183
I want you to meet Annette.
Annette Hargrove, this is Sebastian.

151
00:16:46,393 --> 00:16:51,523
- She'll be staying for a few weeks.
- I guess that makes two of us.

152
00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:54,317
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

153
00:16:54,525 --> 00:17:00,447
Aunt Helen, why don't you whip up
some of that ice tea of yours?

154
00:17:00,657 --> 00:17:04,786
- Don't get into any trouble.
- We won't.

155
00:17:05,787 --> 00:17:09,039
Come on.

156
00:17:10,165 --> 00:17:14,003
Quickly, lots to see.

157
00:17:19,259 --> 00:17:26,473
I read your manifesto, I must say,
I found it rather appalling.

158
00:17:27,767 --> 00:17:32,605
- Most people praise me for it.
- Most people are sheep.

159
00:17:32,814 --> 00:17:35,900
You criticise something
you've never experienced.

160
00:17:36,067 --> 00:17:42,198
I just believe people shouldn't
make love before they are in love.

161
00:17:42,406 --> 00:17:46,286
People our age aren't mature enough
to know those emotions.

162
00:17:46,493 --> 00:17:50,707
- Are you a lesbian?
- No.

163
00:17:50,874 --> 00:17:54,794
I just picked up on
a little of that lesbian vibe.

164
00:17:55,002 --> 00:17:58,714
I wouldn't expect you
to understand my beliefs.

165
00:17:58,923 --> 00:18:05,346
- What's that supposed to mean?
- I know of your reputation.

166
00:18:05,555 --> 00:18:07,598
What have you heard?

167
00:18:07,807 --> 00:18:12,353
That you promise girls the world
to get them in bed with you.

168
00:18:12,519 --> 00:18:16,148
- Who told you this?
- A friend wrote me.

169
00:18:16,356 --> 00:18:20,737
- That's a little tacky.
- It's the truth, isn't it?

170
00:18:20,944 --> 00:18:24,907
If you say so.

171
00:18:30,038 --> 00:18:34,416
That's good.
Let's try the G-major scale.

172
00:18:38,046 --> 00:18:42,342
Once again.
Remember, the third note is sharp.

173
00:18:43,343 --> 00:18:46,261
I suck!

174
00:18:46,471 --> 00:18:50,349
Relax, Take a deep breath.

175
00:18:50,557 --> 00:18:55,771
You're concentrating too much
on your bowing, Let me help you.

176
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:59,233
Close your eyes.

177
00:19:19,962 --> 00:19:25,884
Mai-lee, be careful!
We've had this discussion.

178
00:19:26,051 --> 00:19:30,847
I didn't mean to interrupt.
Your playing was beautiful.

179
00:19:31,057 --> 00:19:34,978
This is Ronald Clifford.
He'll be teaching me this summer.

180
00:19:35,185 --> 00:19:38,981
- Nice to meet you.
- Likewise, I'm sure.

181
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:43,236
Ronald is attending pre-Juilliard.
He's composing his first opera.

182
00:19:43,403 --> 00:19:49,784
- It's based on Martin Luther King.
- Dr King is my favourite.

183
00:19:51,827 --> 00:19:56,833
I guess our hour's up.
Same time tomorrow?

184
00:20:03,923 --> 00:20:06,925
Bye.

185
00:20:11,055 --> 00:20:14,392
Unbelievable.
Some fag, no offence, -

186
00:20:14,558 --> 00:20:19,105
- wrote a letter to this chick
describing my tactics.

187
00:20:19,313 --> 00:20:24,736
- Any idea who it could be?
- If I did, the person would suffer.

188
00:20:25,987 --> 00:20:32,951
- Where is the little girl from?
- Kansas, Who do I know in Kansas?

189
00:20:33,161 --> 00:20:36,622
- Greg McConnell.
- The football stud?

190
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:41,126
I wouldn't be surprised
if he was your rat.

191
00:20:41,294 --> 00:20:47,299
He hates me, I fingered his
girlfriend at Homecoming last year.

192
00:20:47,508 --> 00:20:52,430
- I don't think that bothered him.
- What do you mean?

193
00:20:53,847 --> 00:21:00,395
Greg likes to tackle tight ends
on and off the field.

194
00:21:00,605 --> 00:21:04,650
- You're shitting me.
- I shit you not.

195
00:21:04,817 --> 00:21:08,153
He used to sneak into my dorm drunk.

196
00:21:08,362 --> 00:21:11,865
As soon as he'd come
he'd freak out:

197
00:21:12,074 --> 00:21:17,829
"What are you doing? I'm not a fag.
If you tell, I'll kick your ass!"

198
00:21:17,997 --> 00:21:24,796
I only put up with it because
the man has a mouth like a Hoover.

199
00:21:25,003 --> 00:21:30,759
- Too bad he's in Kansas.
- Not anymore.

200
00:21:30,926 --> 00:21:34,638
The football team started practice
last week.

201
00:21:34,846 --> 00:21:38,893
- We've already had a session.
- Good for you.

202
00:21:39,894 --> 00:21:44,690
Could you arrange a get-together
with him tonight?

203
00:21:47,317 --> 00:21:50,654
"Spartacus" is on TV tonight.

204
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:55,284
- Outstanding.
- But it'll cost you.

205
00:21:55,451 --> 00:21:59,413
Just make sure
your front door is unlocked.

206
00:21:59,622 --> 00:22:03,667
Shall we say the stroke of midnight,
no pun intended?

207
00:22:03,834 --> 00:22:08,588
The stroke of midnight it is.

208
00:22:10,215 --> 00:22:15,805
I take out my dick
and I shove it right in her face.

209
00:22:16,012 --> 00:22:19,683
I'm like, "Suck it, you dumb bitch,"

210
00:22:19,892 --> 00:22:24,605
- The Gregster.
- Yes, the Gregster.

211
00:22:27,316 --> 00:22:32,529
- Gregory?
- Hi, Blaine.

212
00:22:32,738 --> 00:22:38,243
I hear you went on a date with
Court Reynolds, I hear he's nice.

213
00:22:38,451 --> 00:22:45,500
He kept talking about this bulimic
headcase he dumped on July 4th.

214
00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:51,214
- Bulimic headcase?
- What a loser she must be.

215
00:22:51,882 --> 00:22:54,134
Sorry.

216
00:22:54,343 --> 00:23:00,016
Court's invited me to the Hamptons
for Labour Day weekend.

217
00:23:00,223 --> 00:23:03,394
- That's great.
- You think so?

218
00:23:03,602 --> 00:23:08,398
- I guess I'm just scared.
- Of what?

219
00:23:08,606 --> 00:23:12,444
Boys, I've never even got
to first base with a guy.

220
00:23:12,653 --> 00:23:16,531
Haven't you practiced
on a girlfriend?

221
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:22,747
- No, that's gross.
- How do you think girls learn?

222
00:23:24,999 --> 00:23:29,127
Close your eyes and wet your lips.

223
00:23:29,295 --> 00:23:33,214
- Are you for real?
- Do you want to learn?

224
00:23:33,423 --> 00:23:36,176
I guess.

225
00:23:46,103 --> 00:23:49,690
- That wasn't so scary.
- It was nothing.

226
00:23:49,898 --> 00:23:56,238
Let's try it again, This time I'll
stick my tongue in your mouth.

227
00:23:56,447 --> 00:24:03,162
Massage my tongue with yours.
That's what first base is.

228
00:24:03,913 --> 00:24:08,459
- Okay.
- Eyes closed.

229
00:24:31,941 --> 00:24:36,653
- Not bad.
- That was cool.

230
00:24:38,447 --> 00:24:43,076
Maybe you should try it
on your friend Ronald sometime.

231
00:24:43,952 --> 00:24:49,290
- What are you saying?
- It's obvious he's crazy about you.

232
00:24:50,625 --> 00:24:53,962
He sends me love letters.

233
00:24:54,171 --> 00:24:58,843
- How romantic, Have you responded?
- No.

234
00:24:59,050 --> 00:25:05,266
- Don't you like him?
- I think about him all the time.

235
00:25:05,473 --> 00:25:08,935
If my mom found out she'd kill me.

236
00:25:09,144 --> 00:25:15,150
- You did hide the letters, right?
- In an antique doll's house.

237
00:25:15,317 --> 00:25:20,823
- Bring me copies of the letters.
- Why?

238
00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:24,076
I'm great at love letters.

239
00:25:24,285 --> 00:25:27,829
I'll have him eating
out of the palm of your hand.

240
00:25:28,038 --> 00:25:32,960
- Maybe you can meet at my house.
- You'd do that for me?

241
00:25:33,167 --> 00:25:37,964
- Of course, We're friends, right?
- Best friends.

242
00:25:39,549 --> 00:25:42,720
Do you want to have a sleepover?

243
00:26:00,528 --> 00:26:03,531
Hello?

244
00:26:04,282 --> 00:26:06,868
Excuse me...

245
00:26:10,663 --> 00:26:17,296
- Excuse me ...
- What a pleasant surprise.

246
00:26:19,714 --> 00:26:24,178
- The music's playing in every room.
- It's not, just yours.

247
00:26:26,012 --> 00:26:28,766
I thought you'd be pleased.

248
00:26:36,815 --> 00:26:40,402
- What are you doing in your room?
- Reading.

249
00:26:40,611 --> 00:26:45,656
- Anything interesting?
- Yes, it's quite intriguing.

250
00:26:47,116 --> 00:26:50,788
For you.

251
00:26:50,996 --> 00:26:55,917
Something to start
the new school year with.

252
00:26:58,628 --> 00:27:02,840
- You didn't have to do this.
- You hate it.

253
00:27:04,884 --> 00:27:10,473
- You just didn't have to do it.
- Can you join me for a swim?

254
00:27:10,641 --> 00:27:15,479
It is ten o'clock,
but we are reasonably young.

255
00:27:15,686 --> 00:27:20,817
Your proposal's only mildly
insulting, so I'll consider it.

256
00:27:22,568 --> 00:27:25,739
Give me a minute.

257
00:27:32,453 --> 00:27:35,457
- Fuck her yet?
- I'm working on it.

258
00:27:35,665 --> 00:27:38,751
Call me later.

259
00:28:01,232 --> 00:28:04,611
Sebastian?

260
00:28:15,163 --> 00:28:20,419
Would you mind turning around
so I can put on my bathing suit?

261
00:28:20,626 --> 00:28:23,881
This is so embarrassing...

262
00:28:27,968 --> 00:28:32,513
It amazes me someone as charming
as you can be so manipulative.

263
00:28:32,722 --> 00:28:35,808
You're not going to start again?

264
00:28:35,976 --> 00:28:39,730
What was my favourite part,.?

265
00:28:39,938 --> 00:28:47,153
"He has never uttered a single word
without some dishonourable intent,"

266
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:53,451
"Every woman he has pursued has
regretted it, Stay away from him,"

267
00:28:53,660 --> 00:29:00,959
You could at least have the decency
to tell me who's bad-mouthing me.

268
00:29:01,125 --> 00:29:04,462
Not a chance.

269
00:29:09,134 --> 00:29:15,432
You're right...
about what you said today.

270
00:29:15,641 --> 00:29:19,060
I've done some things
I'm not proud of.

271
00:29:19,269 --> 00:29:22,814
- I'm not giving you a hard time.
- It's okay.

272
00:29:23,022 --> 00:29:28,944
Look at you,
with all your morals and values...

273
00:29:29,112 --> 00:29:37,287
You seem to be happy in your
choices, I envy you, No bullshit.

274
00:29:37,453 --> 00:29:43,125
Seriously.
You've got everything going for you.

275
00:29:43,335 --> 00:29:48,507
You're smart,
you're beautiful, you're determined.

276
00:29:48,714 --> 00:29:52,219
You're everything I want
in a girlfriend.

277
00:29:53,761 --> 00:29:56,597
You know I'm seeing someone?

278
00:29:56,765 --> 00:30:03,480
Yes, the infamous Trevor, It's funny
how you haven't mentioned him.

279
00:30:03,646 --> 00:30:06,732
He's backpacking through Europe.

280
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:11,278
He's great, I really miss him.

281
00:30:11,488 --> 00:30:16,910
- I care.
- I'm sorry, but you're not my type.

282
00:30:17,118 --> 00:30:19,162
Honestly?

283
00:30:19,371 --> 00:30:24,792
"You're smart,
you're beautiful... determined,"

284
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,837
That won't get you anywhere.

285
00:30:28,003 --> 00:30:34,469
The best you can hope for
is my friendship.

286
00:30:40,808 --> 00:30:43,894
Good night, sweet pea.

287
00:31:04,583 --> 00:31:08,336
- Oh, baby...
- "Baby"?

288
00:31:11,714 --> 00:31:14,384
Right on time.

289
00:31:14,550 --> 00:31:21,266
- Shit! Give me my underwear.
- Don't get so huffy.

290
00:31:24,227 --> 00:31:27,939
What do we have here?

291
00:31:28,147 --> 00:31:32,986
Look, Valmont, it's the first time
I've ever done anything like this.

292
00:31:33,193 --> 00:31:37,740
- I was just...
- Really drunk and blah-blah-blah.

293
00:31:37,949 --> 00:31:42,621
Please don't tell anyone.
This could ruin my whole career.

294
00:31:42,828 --> 00:31:46,333
Your career?
Greg, what about your family?

295
00:31:47,625 --> 00:31:52,963
Wouldn't your dad be humiliated to
find out his son's a fudge-packer?

296
00:31:55,674 --> 00:32:00,596
I'll do anything, Let's just
forget about this whole thing, okay?

297
00:32:04,017 --> 00:32:11,482
No, I can't help you there, You're
bad-mouthing me to Annette Hargrove.

298
00:32:11,691 --> 00:32:14,443
What are you talking about?

299
00:32:15,569 --> 00:32:18,906
You're the only one who knows her.

300
00:32:19,115 --> 00:32:22,868
I never said a word to her
about you.

301
00:32:23,077 --> 00:32:26,580
He's probably telling you the truth.

302
00:32:26,789 --> 00:32:31,627
The man can barely write out
a grocery list, let alone a letter.

303
00:32:35,048 --> 00:32:38,759
All right... I believe you.

304
00:32:39,802 --> 00:32:43,472
Your secret's safe with me.

305
00:32:43,682 --> 00:32:48,435
Actually, there is something
you can do for me.

306
00:32:49,645 --> 00:32:54,692
- What else do you know about him?
- Well, he's smart as hell.

307
00:32:54,901 --> 00:33:01,240
He's dedicated to achieving his
goals, He always gives 110 percent.

308
00:33:02,282 --> 00:33:05,953
He's always watched my back.

309
00:33:06,162 --> 00:33:10,375
He's got a bad rep,
but it's mostly bullshit.

310
00:33:10,541 --> 00:33:13,961
I've heard awful things about him.

311
00:33:14,170 --> 00:33:19,675
- From who?
- I'm sworn to secrecy.

312
00:33:19,843 --> 00:33:25,515
- How long have we known each other?
- Forever.

313
00:33:25,682 --> 00:33:30,561
It's my job to look out for you.
You're like a sister to me.

314
00:33:30,769 --> 00:33:36,108
Do I look like a gossip queen?
It's me, Greg.

315
00:33:36,276 --> 00:33:40,488
The Gregster.
I'm serious.

316
00:33:41,448 --> 00:33:48,078
- You swear not to tell anybody?
- I swear on my momma's life.

317
00:33:49,247 --> 00:33:52,250
That nosy bitch, Are you sure?

318
00:33:52,458 --> 00:33:57,797
She said "Mrs Caldwell".
They met at orientation.

319
00:33:57,963 --> 00:34:02,594
- Did you do what I asked you to?
- Yeah.

320
00:34:02,759 --> 00:34:05,346
- She bought it?
- I'm pretty sure.

321
00:34:05,555 --> 00:34:09,266
- Pretty sure, or sure-sure?
- She bought it.

322
00:34:12,603 --> 00:34:15,690
She tried to outdo me, -

323
00:34:15,898 --> 00:34:21,905
- even though I told her
that I could do this.

324
00:34:22,070 --> 00:34:26,367
My best friends Sue, Kelly
and Frances knew I could do it.

325
00:34:27,202 --> 00:34:30,121
- You okay?
- Yeah.

326
00:34:30,329 --> 00:34:33,875
You would not believe...

327
00:34:38,213 --> 00:34:41,590
- It's my mom.
- I should get going.

328
00:34:41,798 --> 00:34:45,344
- See you tomorrow?
- Absolutely.

329
00:34:48,556 --> 00:34:52,309
- Goodbye.
- Peace out.

330
00:34:53,311 --> 00:34:57,523
"Peace out"? Moron.

331
00:35:00,068 --> 00:35:04,030
- Okay, what's wrong with you?
- Are you ready for this?

332
00:35:05,572 --> 00:35:12,079
I've discovered that Mrs Caldwell
urged Annette to stay away from me.

333
00:35:12,288 --> 00:35:15,123
- Interesting.
- Yes, it is.

334
00:35:15,333 --> 00:35:20,253
I now plan to devote all my energy
to destroying the douchebag.

335
00:35:20,463 --> 00:35:26,052
The plot thickens, Cecile
has fallen for her music teacher.

336
00:35:26,219 --> 00:35:28,887
Mrs Caldwell will love that.

337
00:35:29,054 --> 00:35:33,976
But Don Juan moves with the speed
of a Special Olympic hurdler.

338
00:35:34,184 --> 00:35:37,355
What's your plan of attack?

339
00:35:37,563 --> 00:35:43,318
I rat Cecile out to Mommy, who goes
ballistic and ends the relationship.

340
00:35:44,612 --> 00:35:47,949
But who will they turn to for help?

341
00:35:51,284 --> 00:35:57,833
Cecile is going away with Court
next week.

342
00:35:58,041 --> 00:36:02,338
I need you to speed up
her sexual awakening.

343
00:36:02,505 --> 00:36:06,550
- I'm at your service.
- Thank you.

344
00:36:11,431 --> 00:36:18,228
- That feels good.
- Sis, you're so tense.

345
00:36:18,438 --> 00:36:21,106
I know...

346
00:36:21,273 --> 00:36:26,070
I hate it
when things don't go my way.

347
00:36:26,278 --> 00:36:30,740
It makes me so horny.

348
00:36:30,907 --> 00:36:34,327
I hate it, too.

349
00:36:40,543 --> 00:36:45,965
It seems like things
are looking up for you.

350
00:36:46,673 --> 00:36:50,552
It appears so.

351
00:36:54,599 --> 00:37:02,273
- Any luck with your girl?
- Moving along quite well.

352
00:37:04,525 --> 00:37:11,574
- Have you succeeded in your task?
- Any day now.

353
00:37:15,702 --> 00:37:22,126
Well, let me know when you do.
Until then...

354
00:37:27,965 --> 00:37:30,800
Down, boy!

355
00:37:34,012 --> 00:37:37,016
Come on!

356
00:37:49,152 --> 00:37:52,782
Hi, it's Sebastian.
I didn't wake you, did I?

357
00:37:52,989 --> 00:37:55,576
No, not at all.

358
00:37:55,784 --> 00:38:02,416
- Did I leave my glasses there?
- No, I don't think so.

359
00:38:03,541 --> 00:38:07,045
All right.
I guess I'll see you around.

360
00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:14,344
- Is that really why you called?
- No.

361
00:38:14,552 --> 00:38:19,016
- I miss talking to you.
- A moment of honesty.

362
00:38:19,182 --> 00:38:24,230
- Well, I'm not liking it too much.
- What are you doing tomorrow?

363
00:38:24,438 --> 00:38:27,440
I'm going out with you.

364
00:38:42,789 --> 00:38:48,378
I came as quick as I could.
What's wrong?

365
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:52,048
It's Cecile.

366
00:38:52,215 --> 00:38:58,931
- You promise not to say anything?
- Yes, It isn't drugs, is it?

367
00:38:59,724 --> 00:39:02,726
It's worse.

368
00:39:08,858 --> 00:39:13,403
I think there's something between
Cecile and her music teacher.

369
00:39:14,362 --> 00:39:19,242
- Ronald? That's crazy.
- Yes, she's so young, he's so...

370
00:39:19,452 --> 00:39:23,914
Black!
Brown sugar... no sugar.

371
00:39:24,789 --> 00:39:28,710
He's sent her love letters,
they're under her doll's house.

372
00:39:28,918 --> 00:39:34,340
Something like this could destroy
her reputation at Manchester.

373
00:39:36,342 --> 00:39:41,139
I hope I was right to tell you, I'd
hate to see her ruin it with Court.

374
00:39:42,056 --> 00:39:46,686
- I can't thank you enough.
- You will be discreet?

375
00:39:46,896 --> 00:39:50,690
Absolutely.

376
00:39:58,199 --> 00:40:02,327
- Who the hell do you think you are?
- Excuse me?

377
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:06,956
I'm not paying you
to pervert my child.

378
00:40:07,166 --> 00:40:11,211
I think you're
misunderstanding something.

379
00:40:11,420 --> 00:40:14,672
Care to explain this, then?

380
00:40:17,342 --> 00:40:21,889
- Where did you find those?
- Margarita did, when cleaning.

381
00:40:22,056 --> 00:40:25,768
Go to your room... Now!

382
00:40:29,646 --> 00:40:35,152
How dare you disrespect me?
I got you off the streets.

383
00:40:35,318 --> 00:40:38,697
The streets?
I live at 59th and Park.

384
00:40:38,905 --> 00:40:43,284
Whatever, You are never to set foot
in this house again, -

385
00:40:43,494 --> 00:40:48,581
- and you are never to see
my daughter again, Understood?

386
00:40:48,791 --> 00:40:52,253
First of all,
I never touched your daughter.

387
00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:57,548
Second, I'd like to think
you could look beyond racial lines.

388
00:40:57,757 --> 00:41:02,762
Don't give me that racist crap.
We gave money to Colin Powell.

389
00:41:03,972 --> 00:41:10,311
I guess that puts me in my place.
Thank you for your hospitality.

390
00:41:10,521 --> 00:41:14,275
It was a true awakening.

391
00:41:18,695 --> 00:41:21,949
The black man is gone!

392
00:41:22,115 --> 00:41:25,286
Praise Jesus,
the black man is gone!

393
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:44,929
- I never knew she felt this way.
- You're a lucky guy.

394
00:41:45,139 --> 00:41:49,434
- What do I do?
- Tell her you love her.

395
00:41:49,601 --> 00:41:53,438
Mrs Caldwell will have me shot
if I go near her.

396
00:41:53,646 --> 00:41:57,693
I don't even know
her e-mail address.

397
00:41:57,860 --> 00:42:03,865
E-mail is for geeks and paedophiles.
Be romantic, write another letter.

398
00:42:04,074 --> 00:42:07,869
- How will it get to her?
- We'll make sure she gets it.

399
00:42:09,788 --> 00:42:13,333
- Why are you doing this for me?
- Because...

400
00:42:13,541 --> 00:42:18,005
We want to see Cecile happy.

401
00:42:18,213 --> 00:42:25,804
We know that you'd make her happy.
You'd make any girl happy.

402
00:42:30,893 --> 00:42:33,978
You mind if I have some privacy?

403
00:42:34,146 --> 00:42:39,650
My room's across the hall.
Make yourself at home.

404
00:42:53,623 --> 00:42:56,710
- Who are you calling?
- Cecile.

405
00:42:56,876 --> 00:43:03,050
- What are you doing?
- You know the damage we'll cause?

406
00:43:05,885 --> 00:43:08,096
I'm aware.

407
00:43:08,972 --> 00:43:15,186
Are you really? We've done
some fucked-up shit, but this is...

408
00:43:17,105 --> 00:43:19,690
We're destroying an innocent girl.

409
00:43:21,485 --> 00:43:26,989
Court Reynolds is going down, lf you
won't help me, someone else will.

410
00:43:27,199 --> 00:43:31,911
- You amaze me.
- Eat me, Sebastian.

411
00:43:32,119 --> 00:43:39,168
You guys can fuck everyone, but I
get dumped for twits like Cecile.

412
00:43:39,378 --> 00:43:43,297
God forbid I exude confidence
and enjoy sex.

413
00:43:43,507 --> 00:43:49,762
I must act like Mary Sunshine 24-7
so I can be considered a lady.

414
00:43:49,972 --> 00:43:55,393
I'm the Marcia Brady of the
East Side and I want to kill myself.

415
00:43:55,601 --> 00:43:58,938
There's your psychoanalysis,
Dr Freud.

416
00:43:59,106 --> 00:44:04,443
Now tell me,
are you in, or are you out?

417
00:44:06,237 --> 00:44:09,407
Call her.

418
00:44:21,503 --> 00:44:27,425
It's Kathryn.
Okay, stop crying.

419
00:44:27,592 --> 00:44:31,637
Stop crying.
Hold on for Sebastian.

420
00:44:38,186 --> 00:44:40,856
Cecile?

421
00:44:41,063 --> 00:44:45,277
Stop crying.
Listen to me very carefully.

422
00:44:45,443 --> 00:44:50,532
I have a letter from Ronald.
He asked me to give it to you.

423
00:44:50,740 --> 00:44:56,579
I can't bring it to your house, your
mother despises me, so listen...

424
00:45:30,530 --> 00:45:32,949
Finished.

425
00:45:39,914 --> 00:45:45,045
- This doesn't taste like ice tea.
- It's from Long lsland.

426
00:45:47,380 --> 00:45:51,425
- How's the letter?
- It's excellent.

427
00:45:53,177 --> 00:45:58,224
- Do you think he'll like it?
- He'll love it, Are you kidding?

428
00:46:03,021 --> 00:46:06,690
- What are you doing?
- Just taking a photo.

429
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:12,239
- You know, you could be a model.
- Really?

430
00:46:12,447 --> 00:46:16,659
Too bad you're not sexy.

431
00:46:18,036 --> 00:46:23,458
- I can be sexy.
- All right, show me sexy.

432
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:34,469
Wow, that's very sexy.
Make yourself more comfortable.

433
00:46:39,349 --> 00:46:42,434
No, no, Come here.

434
00:46:47,940 --> 00:46:50,610
Now that's sexy.

435
00:46:54,905 --> 00:47:00,579
Cecile, you know
what would be super-duper sexy?

436
00:47:00,786 --> 00:47:04,416
If you lost all the clothes.

437
00:47:06,418 --> 00:47:11,172
- I don't think so.
- Sorry, that was out of line.

438
00:47:11,380 --> 00:47:15,217
- I think I should go home now.
- I'll have your mom pick you up.

439
00:47:15,427 --> 00:47:17,762
You can't call my mom.

440
00:47:17,971 --> 00:47:26,478
Wow, she doesn't know you're here.
In fact, you're probably grounded.

441
00:47:26,688 --> 00:47:32,443
- I think I should call her anyway.
- I'll do anything, Don't call!

442
00:47:32,610 --> 00:47:37,239
Cecile...
All I want to do is give you a kiss.

443
00:47:38,407 --> 00:47:41,661
Just a kiss?

444
00:47:43,163 --> 00:47:45,914
I swear.

445
00:47:49,085 --> 00:47:52,963
- What are you doing?
- You promised to let me kiss you.

446
00:47:53,172 --> 00:47:57,635
- But then why...
- I don't want to kiss you here.

447
00:47:58,552 --> 00:48:01,556
I want to kiss you there.

448
00:48:03,557 --> 00:48:09,773
- A promise is a promise, Cecile.
- A promise is a promise...

449
00:48:15,235 --> 00:48:17,989
It tickles.

450
00:48:18,045 --> 00:48:23,717
Cecile, are you up yet?
You're going to be late for the...

451
00:48:23,884 --> 00:48:28,012
- Cecile?
- I need a hug.

452
00:48:28,179 --> 00:48:31,809
- Cecile?
- Yeah.

453
00:48:32,016 --> 00:48:36,313
- Jesus, where have you been?
- Shopping.

454
00:48:36,521 --> 00:48:41,943
Hurry up, You're supposed to be
at Mrs Rosemond's before brunch.

455
00:48:42,110 --> 00:48:48,117
She's very important at the school,
and I want you to look your best.

456
00:48:51,327 --> 00:48:55,081
- Afternoon, ladies.
- I didn't know you'd be here.

457
00:48:55,289 --> 00:49:00,045
Why waste such a lovely day
in the city?

458
00:49:00,253 --> 00:49:04,298
- Good point.
- Anyone for tennis?

459
00:49:14,684 --> 00:49:16,811
Excuse me.

460
00:49:18,230 --> 00:49:20,273
That was rude.

461
00:49:20,481 --> 00:49:23,818
She's very strange.

462
00:49:24,027 --> 00:49:28,489
- What am I going to do?
- Is something wrong?

463
00:49:28,657 --> 00:49:32,786
Mrs Collins is short of volunteers
at the retirement home.

464
00:49:32,952 --> 00:49:36,998
- But I have theatre tickets.
- That's terrible.

465
00:49:37,166 --> 00:49:41,711
I have a thought.
Why don't you two fill in for me?

466
00:49:41,878 --> 00:49:45,465
- I'd love to.
- You two are the best.

467
00:49:45,673 --> 00:49:53,139
- Thank you, It's so sweet of you.
- I can't help it.

468
00:49:57,311 --> 00:50:03,233
Isn't he beautiful? It's wonderful
when you young people help out.

469
00:50:03,442 --> 00:50:08,237
Most of our patients
have no family nearby.

470
00:50:08,447 --> 00:50:12,117
Mr Gottlieb,
we have a visitor for you.

471
00:50:12,784 --> 00:50:17,789
No, I've got somebody special
for you, baby.

472
00:50:18,831 --> 00:50:22,753
Did I ever tell you the time
when my late husband...

473
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:28,884
Yes, Mrs Sugerman, you did.
Right after we played backgammon.

474
00:50:29,092 --> 00:50:35,139
- We played backgammon?
- You beat me three times.

475
00:50:35,349 --> 00:50:39,186
- Then I fucked your daughter.
- Excuse me?

476
00:50:39,393 --> 00:50:45,733
- I said, "Care for some water?"
- No, thank you.

477
00:50:49,695 --> 00:50:54,534
- Come in.
- How's it going in here?

478
00:50:54,742 --> 00:51:00,581
We played backgammon,
and I won three times.

479
00:51:00,791 --> 00:51:06,630
- That's the way to go!
- Isn't it wonderful?

480
00:51:06,838 --> 00:51:10,092
I told you she was special.

481
00:51:10,259 --> 00:51:14,721
That was fun.

482
00:51:17,807 --> 00:51:22,728
I actually feel good about myself.
Mrs Sugerman is cool.

483
00:51:22,938 --> 00:51:29,068
Come on.
Mrs Sugerman is cool?

484
00:51:29,277 --> 00:51:32,614
- You must think I'm an idiot.
- No.

485
00:51:32,822 --> 00:51:40,414
- You had a good time with her?
- I did, We played backgammon.

486
00:51:41,623 --> 00:51:45,835
All right, I was bored out of
my mind, I hate doing charity.

487
00:51:46,043 --> 00:51:51,132
It's okay.
That doesn't make you a bad person.

488
00:51:51,340 --> 00:51:55,554
- I can't win with you.
- It's not about winning, Sebastian.

489
00:51:58,764 --> 00:52:03,061
Your problem is,
you take yourself too seriously.

490
00:52:03,228 --> 00:52:07,773
- I do not.
- Yes, you do, Try to lighten up.

491
00:52:07,983 --> 00:52:13,989
I am.
Can we drop this?

492
00:52:20,786 --> 00:52:23,456
What are you doing?

493
00:52:24,583 --> 00:52:28,003
Stop it, It's distracting.

494
00:52:29,170 --> 00:52:33,382
Cut it out.
Stop it.

495
00:52:33,550 --> 00:52:38,096
- Are you smiling?
- No.

496
00:52:40,431 --> 00:52:43,434
Will you stop!

497
00:52:44,436 --> 00:52:49,106
You can relax.
I promise I won't tell anybody.

498
00:53:04,914 --> 00:53:08,751
- Who is it?
- It's Kathryn.

499
00:53:13,380 --> 00:53:17,010
- Are you okay?
- No!

500
00:53:21,597 --> 00:53:23,682
What's wrong?

501
00:53:23,891 --> 00:53:29,648
- Something bad happened last night.
- What do you mean?

502
00:53:29,815 --> 00:53:36,695
- I don't think you want to know.
- Cecile, you have to tell me.

503
00:53:38,197 --> 00:53:43,702
It involves your brother.
He... He took advantage of me.

504
00:53:43,911 --> 00:53:47,831
- Why didn't you do something?
- I don't know.

505
00:53:48,041 --> 00:53:54,047
You came to our house late at night,
and he forced intercourse on you.

506
00:53:54,255 --> 00:53:56,465
Not exactly.

507
00:53:56,675 --> 00:54:02,429
- He made you give him a blowjob?
- No...

508
00:54:02,639 --> 00:54:06,101
What, then?

509
00:54:07,059 --> 00:54:15,068
He took down my panties and
wrote the alphabet with his tongue.

510
00:54:16,235 --> 00:54:21,365
- He went down on you?
- If that's what you call it.

511
00:54:21,574 --> 00:54:24,744
- Well, did you like it?
- No.

512
00:54:24,952 --> 00:54:30,625
I don't know, it was weird.
At first it felt icky, -

513
00:54:30,791 --> 00:54:34,128
- and then it was sort of okay.

514
00:54:34,336 --> 00:54:42,594
Then I started getting really hot,
and then I started shaking...

515
00:54:44,014 --> 00:54:49,518
It was weird,
it just felt like an explosion...

516
00:54:49,728 --> 00:54:55,483
- But a good one.
- Cecile, you had an orgasm.

517
00:54:57,443 --> 00:55:03,615
- I did?
- You're becoming a woman.

518
00:55:03,824 --> 00:55:08,204
- I am?
- Cecile!

519
00:55:12,500 --> 00:55:18,255
Now that you're on your way,
it would be stupid of you to stop.

520
00:55:18,422 --> 00:55:22,802
Think of Sebastian as a tutor.
Let him instruct you.

521
00:55:22,969 --> 00:55:27,974
But I don't love him.
I love Ronald.

522
00:55:28,182 --> 00:55:34,646
Don't you want to make Ronald happy?
Practice makes perfect, Cecile.

523
00:55:34,856 --> 00:55:40,862
My advice is to sleep with
as many people as possible.

524
00:55:41,028 --> 00:55:44,407
That would make me a slut...
Wouldn't it?

525
00:55:44,615 --> 00:55:51,039
Cecile, everybody does it, It's just
that nobody talks about it.

526
00:55:54,208 --> 00:55:59,005
- Like a secret society?
- That's one way of looking at it.

527
00:56:01,132 --> 00:56:05,969
- Fucking idiot...
- Cool.

528
00:56:08,056 --> 00:56:11,059
Secret society, secret society...

529
00:56:19,567 --> 00:56:27,492
- Am I supposed to feel this sore?
- Just the first time, It'll pass.

530
00:56:31,329 --> 00:56:34,581
I like it better when I'm on top.

531
00:56:41,922 --> 00:56:44,925
Cecile...

532
00:56:47,804 --> 00:56:54,101
This is what I call "quiet time",
when we reflect on what we've done.

533
00:56:54,309 --> 00:56:57,396
Sorry.

534
00:56:59,606 --> 00:57:04,152
- Something's the matter?
- You think?

535
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:09,449
- Is it me?
- No, you were fine.

536
00:57:09,659 --> 00:57:14,831
It's that Annette girl.
You love her, don't you?

537
00:57:15,039 --> 00:57:21,753
It's okay, I don't love you, either.
I love Ronald.

538
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:26,217
- Where are you going?
- I'm taking a shower.

539
00:57:26,425 --> 00:57:29,094
- Want company?
- No.

540
00:57:29,304 --> 00:57:33,141
- Want a blowjob?
- Good night, Cecile.

541
00:57:33,807 --> 00:57:37,144
Prude...

542
00:57:47,822 --> 00:57:51,074
Who are you spying on?

543
00:57:51,242 --> 00:57:54,911
- Is that her?
- Yeah.

544
00:57:55,121 --> 00:57:59,833
She's crying, Little baby's upset
by the big bad book.

545
00:58:00,043 --> 00:58:03,503
- Shut up.
- What's up your ass?

546
00:58:03,713 --> 00:58:06,632
Nothing.

547
00:58:06,840 --> 00:58:11,596
- She's getting to you, isn't she?
- If you must know, yes.

548
00:58:11,804 --> 00:58:19,019
I can't stand her holy bullshit,
yet I'm totally infatuated with her.

549
00:58:19,853 --> 00:58:22,773
She made me laugh.

550
00:58:24,942 --> 00:58:28,362
That's why you're losing our bet?

551
00:58:28,570 --> 00:58:32,532
No, It's just taking longer
than I expected.

552
00:58:39,206 --> 00:58:44,170
Do you mind if I take
my new car for a ride?

553
00:58:44,378 --> 00:58:50,217
Kathryn... The only thing
you're going to be riding is me.

554
00:58:50,927 --> 00:58:56,431
If you'll excuse me,
I have some work to do.

555
00:59:11,197 --> 00:59:15,659
- Bonjour, mademoiselle.
- Bonjour, monsieur Valmont.

556
00:59:36,972 --> 00:59:41,018
- I'm sorry about that.
- I am too.

557
00:59:42,936 --> 00:59:47,483
- You know what? I'm not sorry.
- I thought we'd just be friends.

558
00:59:47,692 --> 00:59:51,987
I can't keep my feelings
all bottled up like you.

559
00:59:52,195 --> 00:59:55,992
Do you honestly feel nothing for me?

560
00:59:57,617 --> 01:00:02,289
- I have feelings for you.
- Then what's wrong?

561
01:00:02,498 --> 01:00:07,378
It's not like you have a husband,
unless you're married to Jesus.

562
01:00:07,586 --> 01:00:13,009
- Why can't we be together?
- Do you really want to know why?

563
01:00:16,387 --> 01:00:20,599
It's because
I don't trust myself with you.

564
01:00:46,083 --> 01:00:49,253
Come in.

565
01:00:58,929 --> 01:01:03,476
- I just came to say goodbye.
- Where are you going?

566
01:01:03,643 --> 01:01:09,148
Back to the city, Maybe to France
for the end of the summer.

567
01:01:09,315 --> 01:01:13,277
- I can't take your games anymore.
- What games?

568
01:01:13,485 --> 01:01:17,197
Come off it, You're hot one minute,
cold the next...

569
01:01:17,405 --> 01:01:25,289
- You make me feel inadequate.
- Then I guess it's best you leave.

570
01:01:25,498 --> 01:01:30,418
Sebastian... I don't want us
to part on bad terms.

571
01:01:30,628 --> 01:01:34,465
I'm afraid you don't have a choice
in the matter.

572
01:01:34,673 --> 01:01:39,219
- I don't associate with hypocrites.
- How am I a hypocrite?

573
01:01:39,387 --> 01:01:43,516
You spend all your time preaching
about waiting for love.

574
01:01:43,681 --> 01:01:50,731
Now you're turning your back on it.
So I guess we're just fucked.

575
01:01:50,940 --> 01:01:58,864
I'll move on, but you'll always know
that you turned your back on love.

576
01:01:59,072 --> 01:02:03,369
That makes you a hypocrite.

577
01:02:07,039 --> 01:02:10,583
Have a nice life.

578
01:02:11,418 --> 01:02:14,422
Wait...

579
01:03:23,657 --> 01:03:26,242
I'm sorry, I can't.

580
01:03:46,889 --> 01:03:50,768
Get it together, you pussy.

581
01:04:10,663 --> 01:04:14,208
- Morning.
- Morning.

582
01:04:14,416 --> 01:04:19,630
- So, how did it go last night?
- With who?

583
01:04:19,838 --> 01:04:22,675
Not Cecile, I know all about that.

584
01:04:25,302 --> 01:04:28,137
No, I didn't nail her.

585
01:04:28,304 --> 01:04:32,684
- She shot you down?
- Exactly the opposite.

586
01:04:32,893 --> 01:04:35,728
What went wrong?

587
01:04:39,023 --> 01:04:41,777
I don't know.

588
01:04:41,985 --> 01:04:50,244
She was lying on the bed,
ready to do it, and I was...

589
01:04:52,246 --> 01:04:59,210
- I just didn't feel right about it.
- You had your chance, and didn't?

590
01:05:07,802 --> 01:05:11,639
- She's not in her room.
- Where is she?

591
01:05:11,849 --> 01:05:16,561
She left 30 minutes ago.

592
01:05:16,769 --> 01:05:19,606
Where did she go?

593
01:05:19,773 --> 01:05:27,364
She told your aunt
she was going to stay with friends.

594
01:05:27,572 --> 01:05:31,784
You blew it.
That girl's come to her senses.

595
01:05:31,994 --> 01:05:36,456
She'll never go near you again.

596
01:05:36,664 --> 01:05:42,503
Stupid, stupid...
"Judy", I'll save that one.

597
01:05:45,090 --> 01:05:48,092
It's Valmont, Is she with you?

598
01:05:48,260 --> 01:05:52,556
No, I don't know where she is.
Why don't you leave her alone?

599
01:05:52,722 --> 01:05:58,144
- Where is she?
- She's staying with the Mihallaks.

600
01:05:58,311 --> 01:06:03,483
She caught a train into Penn Station
about 20 minutes ago.

601
01:07:09,173 --> 01:07:15,347
- I'm impressed.
- I'm in love.

602
01:07:54,719 --> 01:07:57,556
Are you okay?

603
01:09:47,498 --> 01:09:50,417
Just a minute.

604
01:09:54,588 --> 01:09:56,925
Come in.

605
01:09:59,844 --> 01:10:02,514
- Bad time?
- Kind of.

606
01:10:02,721 --> 01:10:10,980
You invited me in so I could witness
your little adventure.

607
01:10:11,189 --> 01:10:15,819
Who is our friend
who gives you such pleasure?

608
01:10:17,820 --> 01:10:20,364
Where could he be?

609
01:10:30,332 --> 01:10:35,171
- Fucked-up shit in this house...
- Call me.

610
01:10:39,926 --> 01:10:44,139
You don't get to have all the fun.

611
01:10:47,725 --> 01:10:52,021
I assume you've come here
to make arrangements.

612
01:10:55,483 --> 01:10:58,153
Some other time.

613
01:10:58,360 --> 01:11:01,948
- Excuse me?
- I'm not in the mood.

614
01:11:02,157 --> 01:11:06,286
- I want to fuck.
- And I don't.

615
01:11:07,996 --> 01:11:10,457
Good afternoon, Kathryn.

616
01:11:13,752 --> 01:11:18,672
Sounds great.
I love you, too.

617
01:11:18,881 --> 01:11:22,594
"I love you, too..."

618
01:11:27,806 --> 01:11:31,644
You're completely pussy-whipped.

619
01:11:31,853 --> 01:11:35,481
- Stop it.
- What happened to us?

620
01:11:36,565 --> 01:11:40,612
- Nothing has changed.
- Yes, it has.

621
01:11:40,819 --> 01:11:46,158
- You don't love me anymore.
- Come on, it's just a bet.

622
01:12:01,507 --> 01:12:08,555
- This is ridiculous.
- You're ridiculous, dear brother.

623
01:12:08,722 --> 01:12:15,688
Look what you've been reduced to.
What'll happen when school starts?

624
01:12:15,896 --> 01:12:21,485
You're dating Miss Seventeen
Magazine, the headmaster's daughter.

625
01:12:21,653 --> 01:12:26,407
Before you know it, you'll be
giving campus tours with her.

626
01:12:26,615 --> 01:12:31,578
Her father doesn't know
about your past, does he?

627
01:12:31,787 --> 01:12:37,377
I doubt he'd let his little princess
be seen with you.

628
01:12:37,585 --> 01:12:41,965
It's disappointing to see Annette's
manifesto was a total sham.

629
01:12:42,172 --> 01:12:48,387
As student body president,
I feel it's my duty to tell him.

630
01:12:51,181 --> 01:12:55,811
- Put the phone down.
- This won't take a second.

631
01:13:00,399 --> 01:13:03,069
Quite the predicament you're in.

632
01:13:04,487 --> 01:13:11,786
I was planning on telling her
everything this afternoon.

633
01:13:11,994 --> 01:13:17,667
That's right, I forgot.
You're so in love.

634
01:13:17,833 --> 01:13:23,922
You honestly believe you've changed
in the few days you've known her?

635
01:13:24,131 --> 01:13:29,177
Let me tell you something.
People don't change overnight.

636
01:13:29,386 --> 01:13:34,225
You and I are two of a kind.
I'm not afraid to admit it.

637
01:13:36,810 --> 01:13:41,106
You were going to leave school
a legend, now you'll leave a joke.

638
01:13:41,315 --> 01:13:46,404
- I'm willing to take my chances.
- Don't do it, Sebastian.

639
01:13:46,612 --> 01:13:53,578
You won't only ruin your reputation,
you'll destroy hers.

640
01:15:04,481 --> 01:15:07,150
This is my room.

641
01:15:11,572 --> 01:15:14,115
Can we be quiet?

642
01:15:15,909 --> 01:15:20,581
- I have something to tell you.
- Tell me.

643
01:15:20,789 --> 01:15:26,045
- This isn't working out for me.
- Yeah, me neither.

644
01:15:30,591 --> 01:15:36,889
- What's wrong?
- It's me, I'm completely fucked up.

645
01:15:37,097 --> 01:15:39,766
What are you saying?

646
01:15:47,358 --> 01:15:52,320
I thought I was in love with you,
but it was just a lie.

647
01:15:52,529 --> 01:15:56,033
I wanted it to work,
but unfortunately I feel nothing.

648
01:15:56,951 --> 01:16:03,082
- Why are you doing this?
- I wanted to get you into bed.

649
01:16:04,667 --> 01:16:07,670
You don't mean that.

650
01:16:07,877 --> 01:16:12,425
You know nothing.
You don't even know me.

651
01:16:12,632 --> 01:16:16,011
The fact is,
there is someone I love.

652
01:16:16,220 --> 01:16:21,434
- You don't even compare to her.
- I don't believe you.

653
01:16:21,641 --> 01:16:28,440
I don't know how to make it clearer.
You mean nothing to me.

654
01:16:28,649 --> 01:16:33,320
You were just...
You were just a conquest.

655
01:16:34,572 --> 01:16:37,742
You're such a coward.
Look, you're shaking.

656
01:16:39,534 --> 01:16:43,831
- Is that what you came to tell me?
- I'm sorry, I'm completely...

657
01:16:43,997 --> 01:16:46,751
You're completely fucked up.

658
01:16:48,127 --> 01:16:50,421
Get out.

659
01:16:51,505 --> 01:16:54,091
Get out!

660
01:16:59,305 --> 01:17:03,684
Don't touch me...
Don't touch me.

661
01:17:04,518 --> 01:17:08,898
Don't fucking touch me, Sebastian!

662
01:17:14,028 --> 01:17:16,947
Just leave.

663
01:18:03,661 --> 01:18:06,997
Jesus...
A bit melodramatic, don't you think?

664
01:18:07,163 --> 01:18:11,543
I thought you'd like to know
what happened with Annette.

665
01:18:15,840 --> 01:18:18,926
It's over.

666
01:18:19,635 --> 01:18:24,347
- Really?
- You were right.

667
01:18:24,556 --> 01:18:28,476
I can't change.
You and I are two of a kind.

668
01:18:31,271 --> 01:18:38,237
- I thought we should celebrate.
- Sorry, I'm expecting some company.

669
01:18:40,154 --> 01:18:46,287
- Who? Ronald?
- Not that it concerns you, but yes.

670
01:18:47,537 --> 01:18:51,082
From Ronald.
I haven't had a chance to read it, -

671
01:18:51,292 --> 01:18:56,963
- but I'm pretty sure
it goes something like:

672
01:18:57,131 --> 01:19:03,052
"You mean a lot to me,
I hope we can be friends, etc,"

673
01:19:05,346 --> 01:19:13,021
I expected this shit, so I took the
liberty of getting them together.

674
01:19:13,229 --> 01:19:18,569
You were right, You do get dumped
for the innocent little twits.

675
01:19:20,069 --> 01:19:23,990
- Well done.
- Thank you.

676
01:19:24,198 --> 01:19:28,037
Now... Where were we?

677
01:19:29,287 --> 01:19:34,001
Oh yes, the celebration.

678
01:19:36,377 --> 01:19:40,757
- What shall we toast to?
- To my triumph.

679
01:19:43,594 --> 01:19:50,643
Not my choice, but it's your call.
To your triumph over Annette.

680
01:19:53,979 --> 01:19:58,900
- What's so funny?
- Silly boy...

681
01:19:59,109 --> 01:20:02,613
My triumph isn't over her.

682
01:20:05,948 --> 01:20:10,412
- It's over you.
- Again?

683
01:20:10,578 --> 01:20:17,043
You were very much in love with her.
And you're still in love with her.

684
01:20:17,252 --> 01:20:21,297
But it amused me
to make you ashamed of it.

685
01:20:21,465 --> 01:20:27,554
You gave up your first love because
I threatened your reputation.

686
01:20:29,390 --> 01:20:34,728
Don't you get it?
You're just a toy, Sebastian.

687
01:20:34,936 --> 01:20:39,233
A little toy I like to play with.

688
01:20:39,440 --> 01:20:42,444
And now you've blown it with her.

689
01:20:42,653 --> 01:20:48,242
I think it's the saddest thing
I've ever heard.

690
01:20:48,408 --> 01:20:52,954
Cheers.

691
01:20:57,417 --> 01:20:59,545
It tastes good.

692
01:21:06,051 --> 01:21:13,725
You came to make arrangements,
but I don't fuck losers.

693
01:21:25,863 --> 01:21:28,282
Goodbye, Sebastian.

694
01:21:29,867 --> 01:21:35,372
- It's imperative I talk to her.
- She's not here.

695
01:21:35,581 --> 01:21:40,293
- Will you please tell her I called?
- Of course I will.

696
01:22:24,462 --> 01:22:27,298
- Yes?
- I need to speak to Annette.

697
01:22:27,506 --> 01:22:31,802
She's not here.
I'm entertaining some guests...

698
01:22:32,970 --> 01:22:37,725
I already told you she is not here.

699
01:22:37,934 --> 01:22:41,188
- Will you see she gets this?
- Yes.

700
01:22:41,354 --> 01:22:44,274
- It's really important.
- I understand.

701
01:22:50,988 --> 01:22:56,411
I'm terribly sorry, You never know
who's going to show up here.

702
01:23:14,054 --> 01:23:19,725
"Dear Annette, what can I say to
rectify the harm I've caused you?"

703
01:23:19,935 --> 01:23:24,605
"Being with you was the only time
I've ever been happy,"

704
01:23:24,814 --> 01:23:28,734
"My whole life has been a joke,"

705
01:23:28,944 --> 01:23:32,488
"I prided myself on taking joy
in others' misery,"

706
01:23:32,697 --> 01:23:37,411
"Well, it finally backfired,"

707
01:23:37,618 --> 01:23:41,414
"I succeeded in hurting
the first person I loved,"

708
01:23:43,500 --> 01:23:48,046
"Enclosed is my most
prized possession, My journal,"

709
01:23:49,213 --> 01:23:54,886
"I considered it my trophy.
A collection of my conquests,"

710
01:23:55,929 --> 01:24:01,851
"If you want to know the truth,
please read it, No more lies,"

711
01:24:14,488 --> 01:24:20,078
"Please give me another chance.
I'm a wreck without you,"

712
01:24:47,939 --> 01:24:53,778
- Ronald? It's Kathryn.
- What's up?

713
01:24:54,738 --> 01:24:58,867
- Is everything okay?
- No.

714
01:24:59,033 --> 01:25:03,579
It's Sebastian.
He's out of his mind.

715
01:25:03,787 --> 01:25:09,377
He hit me, then he took off.
I'm afraid to be alone.

716
01:25:09,586 --> 01:25:12,671
- Ronald, I really need you.
- Settle down.

717
01:25:12,881 --> 01:25:18,886
There's more.
It involves Cecile.

718
01:25:19,095 --> 01:25:23,015
Stay there, I'll be right over.

719
01:26:40,551 --> 01:26:42,636
Son of a bitch...

720
01:26:44,972 --> 01:26:48,851
- Valmont!
- Hey, Ronald.

721
01:26:49,060 --> 01:26:54,565
- We have some talking to do.
- Later, I've had a real bad night.

722
01:26:54,774 --> 01:26:59,237
- What's your problem?
- Why did you hit Kathryn?

723
01:26:59,445 --> 01:27:04,283
She got to you, too...
You don't know what you're saying.

724
01:27:04,492 --> 01:27:08,621
She also said you fucked Cecile.

725
01:27:09,831 --> 01:27:14,293
- It's true, isn't it?
- Ronald, I'm sorry...

726
01:27:23,177 --> 01:27:25,721
Sebastian?

727
01:27:27,097 --> 01:27:29,766
Sebastian!

728
01:27:30,894 --> 01:27:33,313
Stop it!

729
01:27:43,323 --> 01:27:45,658
Annette!

730
01:28:03,342 --> 01:28:06,595
Sebastian...

731
01:28:08,305 --> 01:28:14,061
- I love you, Annette.
- I love you, too.

732
01:28:22,487 --> 01:28:25,155
Just hold on...

733
01:28:35,625 --> 01:28:40,087
As the new headmaster
of Manchester Prep -

734
01:28:40,253 --> 01:28:45,592
- it saddens me to start our
new year with such a mournful tone.

735
01:29:09,449 --> 01:29:13,412
- I didn't know anyone was in here.
- I'm sorry.

736
01:29:13,621 --> 01:29:17,041
- Annette Hargrove.
- Kathryn Merteuil.

737
01:29:17,250 --> 01:29:21,546
- Have we met?
- I don't think so.

738
01:29:21,712 --> 01:29:26,842
- Your father's the new headmaster?
- That's right.

739
01:29:27,051 --> 01:29:31,264
I'm sorry to hear
about your brother, Are you okay?

740
01:29:31,471 --> 01:29:36,894
I'll be fine.
Did you know Sebastian?

741
01:29:37,103 --> 01:29:40,021
You might say that.

742
01:29:40,230 --> 01:29:43,984
Such a tragedy, isn't it?

743
01:29:45,027 --> 01:29:49,823
Yes, it is.
I'll leave you alone now.

744
01:29:53,411 --> 01:29:57,457
I'm here if you need a friend.

745
01:29:57,622 --> 01:30:00,877
That's great.

746
01:30:01,085 --> 01:30:05,046
Sometimes when I feel
I can't go on, -

747
01:30:05,256 --> 01:30:09,926
- I turn to Jesus,
and He helps me through it.

748
01:30:10,136 --> 01:30:16,057
- Thank you.
- I'll see you around campus.

749
01:30:17,560 --> 01:30:20,729
Looking forward to it...

750
01:30:20,938 --> 01:30:23,608
...freak.

751
01:30:27,360 --> 01:30:29,905
Here we go.

752
01:30:32,908 --> 01:30:37,872
However dark the cloud,
there's always a silver lining.

753
01:30:38,079 --> 01:30:43,418
It might be hard to see,
but what we should learn from this -

754
01:30:43,627 --> 01:30:48,006
- is to be true to ourselves
and to resist peer pressure.

755
01:30:48,216 --> 01:30:55,014
As student body president I've tried
to set an example in myself.

756
01:30:55,222 --> 01:31:01,811
Unfortunately, I couldn't reach out
to my stepbrother in time.

757
01:31:02,020 --> 01:31:07,234
I know he's looking down
on us today and...

758
01:31:10,320 --> 01:31:14,283
I know he'd want me to say...

759
01:31:17,703 --> 01:31:22,332
He'd want me to say, "Kathryn..."

760
01:31:22,500 --> 01:31:27,587
He'd want me to say,
"Kathryn, I'm sorry,"

761
01:31:27,796 --> 01:31:31,759
What is going on?
Don't you have any respect?

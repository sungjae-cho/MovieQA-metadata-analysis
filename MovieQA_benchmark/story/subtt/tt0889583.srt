1
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:04,098
What's up? I'm Brüno.

2
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:11,093
I live in Austria's coolest city, Vienna.
No big deal. Whatever.

3
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:14,775
I am the host of Funkyzeit,

4
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:19,735
the most important TV fashion show
in any German-speaking country,

5
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:21,699
apart from Germany.

6
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:28,814
Funkyzeit is über influential.

7
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:34,492
In fact, Austrian fashionistas live their lives
according to my "In or Out" list.

8
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:36,537
In! Autism.

9
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:38,378
Aus. Chlamydia.

10
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:42,337
Why is autism so cool at the moment?

11
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:44,968
-Because it's funny.
-Great.

12
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:48,460
Through Funkyzeit,
ich have done interviews

13
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:51,140
mit everyone in the Euro-fashion world.

14
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:53,296
Can you look into this camera and just say,

15
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:56,014
"You're watching Funkyzeit mit Brüno"?

16
00:01:56,140 --> 00:02:00,770
You are watching Funkyzeit programme
with Brüno, and it's really a great show.

17
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:04,537
Yeah, that's cool. Can you do it, like,
even more like a kind of black guy?

18
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:05,615
You know, like an afrikanischer...

19
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:07,014
-Like this?
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

20
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:10,849
You are watching
Funkyzeit programme with Brüno.

21
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:14,177
Yo, man. Fuck, man. Welcome to the jungle.

22
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:15,849
Something maybe a bit more crazy.

23
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:18,369
Maybe show a bit of skin
or something like that.

24
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:22,175
-No, I don't think so.
-Or what about just like one Kugelsack?

25
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:23,653
One of the balls?

26
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,015
No.

27
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:29,169
And the most exciting
and amazing thing in the town,

28
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:34,249
from the fashion streets of Milan,
only for the German girls, my great hairs.

29
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:35,529
Yo, man.

30
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:41,095
Modelling, a lot of people think it's easy.

31
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:43,609
But it's the hardest job in the world, isn't it?

32
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:48,256
It's very hard. Standing in heels all day,
and everyone's watching you,

33
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:50,974
so you have to make sure your walk is good.
And, yeah.

34
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:53,056
Yeah, it's really hard,
'cause you've gotta remember, like,

35
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:56,297
to put your right leg forward
and then put your left leg forward

36
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:58,012
and then, like, which one now?

37
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:02,053
Right leg again, and then, like, the left one.
And then sometimes you even have to turn.

38
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:06,651
Yeah. And especially the turn. It's so scary.

39
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:09,492
Being the host from Funkyzeit

40
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:12,259
means Brüno's always
seated on the front row.

41
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:15,252
Hi. How are you?

42
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:16,699
You have to lose some weight.

43
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:19,334
-The kettle is calling the pot black.
-Yeah?

44
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:25,252
Put your shoulders back.
This is a fashion show, not a slave auction.

45
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:30,293
Mein personal assistant,
Kookus, is my rock.

46
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:32,459
He's also mein stylist.

47
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:35,419
-Do you think the glasses are too much?
-Yeah, I'd lose them.

48
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:36,734
They're too much like, "Look at me.

49
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:38,851
"Hey, everybody, look at me.
Look at my glasses."

50
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:40,493
-Yeah.
-"Everybody, like, stare at my glasses."

51
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:42,451
He's also my nutritionist.

52
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:44,854
Yeah, that is good.

53
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:48,768
I have a second assistant,
but ich can't remember its name.

54
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:52,373
Brüno has known true love twice in his life.

55
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:57,369
Once, for 7 minutes with Milli from
Milli und Vanilli. No big deal. Whatever.

56
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:02,611
But for the last 9 years,
ich have been head über heels in love

57
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:05,777
mit a pygmy flight attendant called Diesel.

58
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:10,811
We're just like an ordinary couple,
you know, boring, stay-at-home types.

59
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:38,933
-Oh, my God. I feel it.
You're getting so big. -Ja.

60
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:45,850
-How much do you want?
-Just half a glass. Otherwise I get too giggly.

61
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:51,296
In September 2008,
I left for Milan Fashion Week

62
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:53,980
to shoot a new season of Funkyzeit.

63
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:59,609
Brüno had backstage access for
the hottest show of the week, de la Prada.

64
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:05,737
So I wore the jewel of mein wardrobe,
a suit made entirely out of Velcro.

65
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:20,815
I'm wearing this.

66
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:24,535
This is a prototype.
It's a Velcro suit made by Frederic Worms.

67
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:25,615
Pretty cool, right?

68
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:28,812
It is. I was looking at it, and can I have one?

69
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:31,251
-Well, it's a prototype. It's a one-off.
-Okay.

70
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:32,893
-Thank you.
-Yeah. Okay...

71
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:34,339
-Also... Yeah.
-Can you go out, please?

72
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:35,529
We'll get out, but don't push me.

73
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:39,130
Yeah. Okay, no listen.
We haven't finished the thing.

74
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:40,295
-You go out now.
-Yeah.

75
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:41,694
Yeah, wait a second.

76
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:45,378
Take... Get this off...

77
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:47,575
Stop!

78
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:57,298
-Thank you.
-Can someone help this guy?

79
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:58,739
Can you take...

80
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:09,059
Wait. Get me out of this.
Get me out of this.

81
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:31,571
Brüno was aus.

82
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:35,376
For the second time in a century,

83
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:38,617
the world had turned
on Austria's greatest man

84
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:42,012
just because he was brave enough
to try something new.

85
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:44,496
-No.
-Okay.

86
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:46,651
Brüno was schwarz-listed.

87
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:49,454
-I'm on the front row.
-I don't think so.

88
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:57,055
I'm sorry.

89
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:05,168
Und worst of all...

90
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:06,375
Hello?

91
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:09,855
...ich was fired from Funkyzeit.

92
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:18,772
Ich realised that night that the fashion world
was superficial und vacuous.

93
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:26,053
So, I decided instead to go to Los Angeles
to become a celebrity.

94
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:33,652
Ich was going to be
the biggest Austrian superstar since Hitler.

95
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:37,212
What? I'm not coming.

96
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:42,257
-Why not?
-Because you out. You humiliate me.

97
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:45,658
-I'm so sorry I humiliate you.
-Okay. Gotta go.

98
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:48,572
Bye, baby, I love you.

99
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:51,419
Diesel, I love you. Diesel.

100
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:40,738
Ich arrived in LA

101
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:44,853
und cunningly avoided
being snapped by the waiting paparazzi.

102
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:49,019
No photos, please. Do you want
another Diana on your hands?

103
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:53,693
Mein Plan was to become

104
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:56,698
the biggest gay movie star
since Schwarzenegger.

105
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:58,538
Maximum Santzgaut!

106
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:04,050
Also, ich headed to my first meeting
mit a Hollywood über agent.

107
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:07,659
So my name's Brüno.
I was born in Klagenfurt.

108
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:12,854
I'm 19 years old. And, of course,
you'll know me as the host of Funkyzeit.

109
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:16,012
Okay. Well, I understand
that you took a look at a side

110
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:19,291
that I wanted you to think about
from the Jerry Maguire show.

111
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:22,139
And I wouldn't mind
hearing you try that out.

112
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:23,534
Okay, great.

113
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:28,778
-"Jerry enters."
-No.

114
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:31,289
-"Dorothy seated."
-Just start with the word "hello."

115
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:33,816
"Hello. Hello.

116
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:36,691
"I'm looking for my wife!

117
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:41,537
-"Shut up, women." That was improvisation.
-Fine.

118
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:46,173
"I couldn't hear your voice
or laugh about it with you."

119
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:06,098
-All right, let me stop... Wait.
-No, wait, wait. I...

120
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:09,417
Let me stop for 2 minutes.
Let me stop you right there.

121
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:12,128
Nowhere in the script does it say

122
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:16,374
he pauses for an inordinate period of time.

123
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:21,339
You're here because
you are looking to do feature films.

124
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:22,779
I wanna be a star.

125
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:24,174
-In?
-In a huge Hollywood movie.

126
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:27,850
-Can you make that happen?
-No.

127
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:29,049
-What?
-I definitely cannot.

128
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:35,614
But he did get me a starring role
in a top TV show as an extra.

129
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:40,170
All right, picture's next.
Last looks, please.

130
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:44,975
Set.

131
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:46,613
-Background.
-Action.

132
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:48,648
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

133
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:52,739
it gives me no pleasure at all
to speak to you this afternoon.

134
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,651
The defendant, as you know,

135
00:10:56,780 --> 00:11:02,013
has served our municipality
for more than 12 years as city controller.

136
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:05,177
So I was pained to learn that his debts

137
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:10,249
compelled him to accept
hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes.

138
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:13,498
-Cut!
-Just do a little bit less.

139
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:15,054
-More or less?
-Less.

140
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:16,819
-Less. Okay.
-Yeah.

141
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:18,573
Sure. Thank you.

142
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:23,695
-Set.
-Action.

143
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:24,809
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

144
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:27,932
I'm afraid it gives me no pleasure at all
to speak to you this afternoon.

145
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:31,379
As you know, the defendant has
served our municipality as city controller

146
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,774
for more than 12 years,

147
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:37,293
and I have known him personally
for most of that time.

148
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:41,775
So I was very pained to learn that

149
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:45,449
his personal debts
compelled him to accept bribes.

150
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:46,774
-Cut!
-Here, I'll take that.

151
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:48,015
-Okay.
-Thank you.

152
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:51,175
Sorry.

153
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:52,619
-Should we just go again?
-Okay.

154
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:56,129
As you know, the defendant

155
00:11:57,260 --> 00:12:00,218
has served this municipality as
city controller for more than 12 years,

156
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:04,811
and I have personally known him
for most of that time.

157
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:07,215
That is why I was very pained to learn...

158
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:10,650
Cut. Sorry, I'm not feeling this one.
Could we go again?

159
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:12,369
This way.

160
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:32,016
You were actually my second choice.

161
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:37,658
I was going to go to the salon that maintains
Salma Hayek's inner thighs,

162
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:41,890
but the team that do it were booked up
for the next 4 days

163
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:43,692
because she's got the Elle Style Awards.

164
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:48,013
And they said they're, like, really,
really exhausted after they do her.

165
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:50,893
They're exhausted
after they wax Salma Hayek?

166
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:52,851
She must have a lot of hair.

167
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:56,575
They say that after a waxing,
there's enough to stuff a mattress.

168
00:12:57,300 --> 00:13:00,451
Well. Speaking of rectums,
let's get you clean.

169
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:02,897
-Okay. There we go.
-There's not much.

170
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:04,135
Yeah, sure.

171
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:06,375
There you go. Now there's wax in there.

172
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:09,133
Telephone.

173
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:11,251
-Hello?
-Hey, how you doing, man?

174
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:12,938
Lloyd, hi. How are you?

175
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:15,893
I just got off the phone with the network.
They've agreed to do a screening.

176
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:18,853
Great! Das is all maximum Santzgaut!

177
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:22,609
In 2 days. I got them to pay
for a focus group for the show.

178
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:24,412
I think you just scraped my anus.

179
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:25,768
I did. I got you clean.

180
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:28,290
My stinker is slightly burning.
Is that normal?

181
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:29,375
What?

182
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:32,492
No, that was to the lady who is...
I'm in the salon, yes.

183
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:34,417
She's just washing my Arschwitz.

184
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:37,612
Is there any way we can get something
together enough to put it on?

185
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:39,890
-Okay, sure.
-All right. I'm gonna call them right now.

186
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:41,652
Are you using Vaseline?

187
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:42,815
No, lotion.

188
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:45,852
Could you take your finger
out of my Arschenholer?

189
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:48,130
All right. I think, guys, we're finished.

190
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:51,093
Once again, "Can you take my finger,
your finger out of my ass,"

191
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:52,653
is what the guy just said on the phone.

192
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:55,533
No, Lloyd, I was not speaking to you.
I was just talking to the woman here.

193
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:56,809
Who's got the audio?

194
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:00,050
I want to hear the audio back.
I want you to hear...

195
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:02,171
I want you to hear what this fool is saying.

196
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:05,133
Play it back. Talking about what?
His asshole.

197
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:31,419
Can you be quiet?

198
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:36,455
Hello, hello. Hey, can you come in?

199
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:38,298
Do any of you guys
want to make some more money?

200
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:44,459
-Hi. How are you?
-Hi.

201
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:47,378
-I'm Brüno. Great to have you here.
-It's nice to meet you.

202
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,809
Come and sit on our great furniture.

203
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:55,015
These are our Mexican chair people.

204
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:57,975
Demi Moore has 2 of them in her house.

205
00:14:58,340 --> 00:14:59,659
Yeah, if you sit here.

206
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:02,378
If you sit on that one.

207
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:07,220
Also, so tell me about
your humanitarian work.

208
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:11,977
How important is it for you
to help other people?

209
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,889
Helping other people is so vital to my life.

210
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:20,778
It's like the air that I breathe
and the water that I drink.

211
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:25,219
-Please, have some water.
-It is extremely, extremely important for me.

212
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:28,571
You give love to other people
and you get love back in spades.

213
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:29,974
And I just feel like that's been my life.

214
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:33,890
Great. You must be hungry.
Let's bring in some food.

215
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:36,493
Oh, my God.

216
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:39,218
-Have some.
-Yeah, this is really bad for me.

217
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:41,649
I'm sorry. This is really not good.

218
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:43,179
We're leaving.

219
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:46,293
Come back, please.
Can you please come back?

220
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:55,410
Yes, yes, I understand.
But I was thinking...

221
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:59,818
Okay, but... Okay. Okay.

222
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:01,812
Yes. Thank you.

223
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:10,052
Minimum Santzgaut.

224
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:13,895
Puffy Vater?

225
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:17,528
Reese Witterspinzel?

226
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:19,655
Stevie Wunderbar?

227
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:22,968
Wilhelm Schmidt?

228
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:25,939
Bradolf Pittler?

229
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:47,619
I think this focus group is really gonna be

230
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:50,533
a very interesting example
of how it's gonna play out.

231
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:53,618
I actually got an interview mit Harrison Ford.

232
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:56,059
-Very good. Very good.
-Yes.

233
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:58,853
So, you probably already know, today
we're going to be looking at a new TV show,

234
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:01,699
A-List Celebrity Max Out mit Brüno.

235
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:04,574
-Howdy, I'm Lloyd Robinson.
-Lloyd, Denny Bond.

236
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:06,338
Hi. Hi. Great.

237
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:09,736
Me und Lloyd, we haven't actually spoke
since the other day

238
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:12,294
when I was getting my anus bleached.

239
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:16,175
We won't go there, please.

240
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:17,972
-We won't go there. Yeah.
-That was a very

241
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:19,374
difficult issue on the phone.

242
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:21,571
And it's very important
what scores you give it,

243
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:23,975
because if the show scores over an 85%,,

244
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:26,853
the network's obviously gonna be
very interested. So take a look.

245
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:29,059
-Absolutely.
-Congratulations.

246
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:33,779
Who's ready to max out
with loads of celebrities? I am.

247
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:38,459
Because das ist A-List Celebrity Max Out.

248
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:54,331
-How are you?
-Great. Thank you for having me.

249
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:56,098
Okay, so this is the part of the show,

250
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:58,176
it's called Future Kinder.
People who are pregnant,

251
00:17:58,300 --> 00:17:59,858
we've managed to get the ultrasound photos.

252
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:00,935
-It's totally great.
-Okay.

253
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:04,416
Okay, it is Britney's sister.
I can't even remember her name.

254
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:06,178
-What's her name?
-Jamie Lynn.

255
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:08,734
Jamie Lynn Spears.
I mean, is she a celebrity?

256
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:09,815
No.

257
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:15,776
Okay, let's see
what she's got in her stomach.

258
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:19,578
All right. What do you think there?
Is that a white-trash foetus?

259
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:20,928
Yeah. Totally.

260
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,170
She's got her arms up like she's a A-lister.

261
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:26,497
Newsflash, you're in a C-lister's womb.
Am I right?

262
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:28,417
Worse. I think, like, D.

263
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:30,332
Do you think this kid is retarded?

264
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:32,338
Definitely the hands look way too big,

265
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:34,655
and the ears, like,
have not been developed yet.

266
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:37,658
-Yeah, so keep it or abort it?
-Abort it.

267
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:44,012
Und now, my exclusive interview
mit Harrison Ford

268
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:49,809
is only moments away.
But first, some more dancing mit Brüno.

269
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:03,170
That's right.
It's the time you've all been waiting for.

270
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:09,694
It's my one-on-one,
exclusive interview mit Harrison Ford.

271
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:13,215
-Also, here I am mit Harrison Ford.
-Fuck off!

272
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:16,015
What's that?

273
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:30,614
That's actually mine.

274
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:32,929
-More champagne?
-No, I'm fine, thanks.

275
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:39,255
Brüno!

276
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:46,452
The end bit was Lloyd's idea.

277
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:48,938
The last bit was? Lloyd's?

278
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:54,532
So if you could
describe this show in one sentence...

279
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:56,737
Can anybody give me one sentence?

280
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:59,374
-Go ahead.
-The worst piece of crap I have ever seen.

281
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:02,220
There's always one who's against it. Those...

282
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:03,739
In any group, there's always one.

283
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:06,613
What sick human being came up
with something like this?

284
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:08,890
Well, there's always 2.
There's always 2.

285
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:11,853
I wanted to poke my eyes out
with hot needles.

286
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:13,811
You'd have to borrow the needles from me.

287
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:15,773
Lloyd, we need to distract him

288
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:17,333
-from listening to this.
-You can't. You can't.

289
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:18,893
-We need to distract him.
-You can't.

290
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:20,089
-Kiss me.
-No.

291
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:23,178
No logical person
would consider a show like this

292
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:27,009
unless they had
some sort of a mental or moral defect.

293
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:28,609
Everything.

294
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:32,935
Oh, my God.

295
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:34,938
Let me have a look at those.

296
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:37,938
"The host is a talentless idiot."

297
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:40,974
Is this the dancing of a talentless idiot?

298
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:45,928
-I would say that it is.
-Yeah, yeah.

299
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:47,574
Please, where you going?

300
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:50,419
Please, this is my career.
I put all my money into this.

301
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:29,173
I'm here with Congressman Ron Paul,

302
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:32,337
who was the 2008 presidential candidate.

303
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:35,808
So tell me, who are you wearing?

304
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:39,577
Well, I don't even know
because it's pretty conventional.

305
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:42,772
And I'm pretty, in that sense, pretty ordinary.

306
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:44,697
But the message is not ordinary.

307
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:51,369
Sure.

308
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:02,293
-Do you want some champagne?
-I don't care for any. No.

309
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:05,253
There's no ice bucket,
but I know a good place to put it.

310
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:10,291
Yeah, you were great in there.
Have you done a lot of television before?

311
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:14,288
Well, off and on throughout the years.
This last year, a tremendous amount.

312
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:16,018
-Sure.
-I do a lot of them.

313
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:17,973
Do you want some strawberries

314
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:20,250
-or maybe some oysters?
-No, I'm okay.

315
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:22,610
I'm gonna light some candles if it's okay.

316
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:25,499
Really loosens you up.

317
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:29,780
Has anyone ever told you
you look like Enrique Iglesias?

318
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:34,251
Of course not. You're much cuter.

319
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:40,015
I love music.

320
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:45,371
And dancing. I used to be a dancer.

321
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:06,329
-All right! Get out of here!
-What?

322
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:08,812
-All right, this has ended.
-What's going on?

323
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:13,373
That guy is queerer than the blazes.
He took his clothes off. Let's get going.

324
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:15,536
-What happened?
-He's queer. He's crazy.

325
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:17,378
He put a hit on me. He took his clothes off.

326
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:19,934
I couldn't even schtupp RuPaul.

327
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:22,531
How would I become weltfamous?

328
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:26,739
Ich decided to seek advice
from the wisest guy I'd ever known.

329
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:28,891
I wanna speak to Milli

330
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:32,012
from the pop dance group Milli und Vanilli.

331
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:37,616
Is he in heaven?
And if so, is he in the VIP section there?

332
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:44,251
He says he's in a place
with green trees and flowers.

333
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:48,017
Can I ask him if he has any advice for me?

334
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:57,298
He says there's some sort of thing that you
will set up, like a foundation or something,

335
00:23:57,420 --> 00:24:00,651
where there will be other people involved
that will benefit.

336
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:06,248
Okay, that's a great idea, 'cause if I do that,
then I'll definitely become world famous.

337
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:07,649
Absolutely.

338
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:11,489
There's something that he could do
that could make me incredibly happy.

339
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:13,971
-Can I kiss him now?
-Of course.

340
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:30,688
Well, good luck with your life.

341
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:36,013
Thanks to Milli,
ich could now see clearly

342
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:38,176
despite having an eyeful of Schpunken.

343
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:41,578
Charity was a great way to become famous.

344
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:46,930
Also, Brüno just needed to find
the hottest world tragedy to fix.

345
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:49,893
I want a charity that doesn't involve
too much effort,

346
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:54,536
but is gonna really make a difference,
you know, really put me into the A-list.

347
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:57,493
Is there something that you, like,
that you believe in?

348
00:25:57,620 --> 00:25:59,133
Well, I'm really into issues.

349
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:02,093
Yeah. Global warming's only getting worse.

350
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:03,175
-So...
-Great.

351
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:05,689
Now, I think that would be...
That's something to get involved now,

352
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:09,529
so, we can just help ease the...

353
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:12,652
Like, after us, in order to help for our future.

354
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:16,455
In order for everyone... It's just
a beneficial thing to be involved with now.

355
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:19,818
I'm really into doing something
maybe for Africa.

356
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:21,817
-Okay.
-Is that still cool or...

357
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:26,252
Saving some kind of extinct animal.
What's going extinct right now?

358
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:28,776
-I don't know, like elephants or something.
-And then make bracelets?

359
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:32,131
That's so bad. Never mind.
I was gonna say make bracelets out of a...

360
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:34,933
Make bracelets out of the extinct animal?

361
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:37,176
That's not gonna really work though,
because you need the...

362
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:39,416
You can't take from the extinct animal.

363
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:46,336
What's the coolest type of charity
to get into at the moment?

364
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:49,378
Save Dafar?

365
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:51,494
-Save what?
-Save Dafar.

366
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:53,178
-Save Dafar, yeah.
-Angelina Jolie.

367
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:55,450
Is that in, like, Iraqi or something like that?

368
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:57,457
Yeah, that's in the... It's in... Yeah.

369
00:26:57,580 --> 00:26:58,535
Yeah.

370
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:03,017
Is there anywhere in the world
that no celebrity has tried to fix?

371
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:05,051
Darfur is the big one now.

372
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:07,575
-Yeah, no, it is.
-What's the new one? What's Dar-five?

373
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:08,849
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

374
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:13,098
Ich was going to become famous
by solving a world problem.

375
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:14,255
But which one?

376
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:17,618
Clooney's got Darfur.

377
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:21,528
Sting's got the Amazon,
and Bono's got AIDS.

378
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:26,130
Luckily, there was still one shithole
left to fix,

379
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:28,054
the Middle-earth.

380
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:35,017
Mein Plan was to get both sides to sign
a peace deal in front of the world's press,

381
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:37,336
making Brüno über famous.

382
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:42,255
Hi, I love your hat. It's great.

383
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:56,572
Hey, great. Is that Marc Jacobs?

384
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:01,694
Lutz! Lutz! Start the car!

385
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:03,855
Lutz!

386
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:12,091
Why are you so anti-hummus?

387
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:15,578
I mean, isn't pita bread the real enemy?

388
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:18,534
You're confusing Hamas
with hummus, I believe.

389
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:20,574
-Hummus has nothing to do with Hamas.
-Do you think

390
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:22,975
there is a relation
between Hamas and hummus?

391
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:26,297
So was the founder of Hamas a chef?

392
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:32,095
He had created the food
and then got lots of followers.

393
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:37,931
Hummus has nothing to do with Hamas.
It's a food. Okay? We eat it. They eat it.

394
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:41,059
It's vegetarian. It's healthy. It's beans.

395
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:44,730
Well, do you both agree on that?

396
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:48,333
We both agree that hummus is very healthy.

397
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:50,497
So we're making progress.

398
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:53,651
Let's try and get a solution, right?

399
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:58,177
'Cause I'm not gonna be here forever.
Will you, the Palestinians,

400
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:03,171
agree to give the pyramids back
to the Israelis?

401
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:05,372
This is in Egypt. Not in Palestine.

402
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:08,932
I don't care where you put them.
Give them back.

403
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:13,735
This is about gaining something
for your own people

404
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:17,535
whether you believe it,
whether you were convinced to do that.

405
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:19,776
-But in any case...
-All right, okay. Take it easy, girlfriend.

406
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:21,015
-All right.
-Civil rights...

407
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:24,416
If I did not get these queens
to sign a peace deal soon,

408
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:26,212
I would not become famous.

409
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:30,812
So I decided to think outside
the Geschwindigkeitsbegrenzung.

410
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:36,255
I've written a song that I think
is gonna help us make peace.

411
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:38,373
In fact, I know it will.

412
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:41,898
I've written a song

413
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:47,370
that I hope is gonna bring you two together

414
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:53,495
It's time for this war to end

415
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:56,857
Jews and Hindus, you be friends

416
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:59,609
This is the Middle East

417
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:03,449
Creating love is my mission

418
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:05,172
Don't kill each other

419
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:07,530
Shoot a Christian

420
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:14,975
Ich bin Brüno, dove of peace

421
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:20,693
Ich bin Brüno, dove of peace

422
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:27,218
Ich bin Brüno, dove of peace

423
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:40,975
Yeah, a bit more than that.

424
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:43,170
Ich was out of options.

425
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:47,657
My song hadn't worked, und I didn't have
enough ecstasy for everyone.

426
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:50,772
Ich was ready to give up
when I suddenly remembered something

427
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:52,458
that the Jude had said.

428
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:55,209
In the last few years,
people were kidnapped,

429
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:59,049
and then they would
broadcast it to the whole world.

430
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:00,499
-To the whole world?
-Yeah.

431
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:02,178
So what, the whole world gets to see

432
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:03,699
-these hostage videos?
-Of course. Of course.

433
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:12,096
Ich would become famous
by getting kidnapped.

434
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:19,654
I am going to say something
that is gonna get you so angry

435
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:22,660
that if you've got a gun on you,
you're gonna pull it out

436
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:25,852
-and shoot me in the head. Are you ready?
-Yeah.

437
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:29,014
Your hair is sun damaged.

438
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:35,699
I'll be honest with you. I want to be famous.

439
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:41,258
And I want the best guys in the business
to kidnap me. Al-Qaeda is so 2001.

440
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:43,739
I don't like.

441
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:46,448
Can I give you guys a word of advice?

442
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:50,336
Lose the beards, because your King Osama

443
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:54,612
looks like a kind of dirty wizard
or a homeless Santa.

444
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:11,057
Get out. Get out now.

445
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:14,060
Ich was encouraged
to leave the Middle East.

446
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:14,139
Ich was encouraged
to leave the Middle East.

447
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:16,331
But Brüno had a new plan.

448
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:18,690
It involved stopping off in Africa

449
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:21,414
on the way home for a little bit of shopping.

450
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:11,659
Mein little afrikanischer
Freund was going to get me

451
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:14,089
on the cover of every magazine.

452
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:17,255
Also, ich hired a top photographer

453
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:20,770
und held a casting for
the hottest baby photo shoot ever.

454
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:25,133
We're gonna do like this religious theme

455
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:29,617
where my baby is gonna be
on a crucifix playing Jesus

456
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:31,378
even though my baby's black.
So it's pretty cool, no?

457
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:33,456
That's cool.
It's kind of like that Madonna video.

458
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:35,571
Yeah, it's really edgy.
You know, we're turning it on its head.

459
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:37,258
Why not? Come on. Whatever.

460
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:41,771
So. We're looking for 2 thieves
to be on the crucifixes next to my baby.

461
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:46,098
Would you be ready for your baby
to be strung up on a crucifix next to mine?

462
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:48,814
Fine. Yeah, I don't mind her
being up on a crucifix.

463
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:49,929
Sure.

464
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:53,655
Is your baby comfortable with bees,
wasps and hornets?

465
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:56,010
George is comfortable with everything.
He's fine.

466
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:58,893
Is he comfortable with dead
or dying animals?

467
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:01,289
Yes.

468
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:03,089
Great.

469
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:05,139
Amateur science?

470
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:06,249
What do you mean by that?

471
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:11,818
You know, some untrained people
conducting scientific experiments.

472
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:13,375
-Should be fine.
-You know,

473
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:15,331
her mixing the pots of acid and that type...

474
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:16,853
-Okay.
-And so it's a yes.

475
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:18,208
-Yes.
-Great.

476
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:21,138
Is she okay with
extremely rapid acceleration?

477
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:22,889
Yes.

478
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:24,095
-Okay.
-Yes.

479
00:34:24,220 --> 00:34:27,212
Does she always have to be in a car seat,
or can she just, like, freestyle it?

480
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:29,854
Yeah. You can freestyle it,
put her in a car seat. Whatever.

481
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:31,493
If it looks better without the car seat...

482
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:32,609
Of course. Of course.

483
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:35,652
So what? You're travelling fast.
You're not gonna kill it.

484
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:37,099
Of course. Of course.

485
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:40,292
Is your baby fine
with antiquated heavy machinery?

486
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:43,169
Yeah, she's fine. She's been around that.

487
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:45,291
Would she be fine to operate them?

488
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:46,739
-Yes.
-Great.

489
00:34:47,220 --> 00:34:49,939
Is your baby fine with lit phosphorus?

490
00:34:50,220 --> 00:34:51,175
Yes.

491
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:53,018
Excellent. Does he like it?

492
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:55,132
-Loves it.
-Good.

493
00:34:55,540 --> 00:34:58,577
A little sensitive subject here.
How much does she weigh?

494
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:00,770
She's about 30 pounds.

495
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:03,813
-Thirty pounds.
-Yes. Approximately.

496
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:07,099
Can Olivia lose 10 pounds in the next week?

497
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:09,570
In the next week, 7 days.

498
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:13,814
Yeah. I'd have to do whatever I could.

499
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:15,453
If there's a problem losing the weight,

500
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:18,856
would you be ready to have Olivia
undergo liposuction?

501
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:21,933
If that was a last resort
and she didn't lose the few pounds,

502
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:24,335
then, yeah, we'd have to do that.

503
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:26,698
Great. Fantastisch news.

504
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:31,336
We have chosen your baby
to be dressed as a Nazi officer

505
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:36,974
pushing a wheelbarrow with another baby
as a Jew in it into an oven.

506
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:38,819
Into an oven?

507
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:41,176
Congratulations. How do you feel?

508
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:43,768
-Great, if she got the job. That's great.
-Yeah.

509
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:18,617
O.J., you're going to be on television.

510
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:47,736
Welcome back to Today with Richard Bey.

511
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:51,819
Now, our next guest is a single parent.
Please welcome Brüno.

512
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:04,135
Where are you from?

513
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:05,489
I'm from Austria.

514
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:09,329
Austria. And what are your impressions
of the American people?

515
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:10,575
You see a lot of them out here.

516
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:14,579
I gotta say, I love American people,
and I love African-American people.

517
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:17,373
You're the best. You guys are the best.

518
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:21,780
All right, all right.
Now, you are a single parent.

519
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:23,175
-Yeah.
-Most people think that a child

520
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:24,528
should have 2 parents.

521
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:27,732
It is, like, really difficult, you know,

522
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:30,977
bringing up a child without another parent.
Am I right?

523
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:32,169
-Right.
-Right.

524
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:35,736
I'm hoping that I don't grow old alone.
Am I right?

525
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:36,815
True that. True that.

526
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:39,408
I'm hoping that I find Mr. Right. Am I right?

527
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:40,495
-No!
-No!

528
00:37:41,620 --> 00:37:43,178
No, no, no.

529
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:46,579
Well, honey, you need to get it together.
Sugar, you're lost and confused.

530
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:48,019
-All right, now...
-Listen, you're just jealous

531
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:49,732
'cause you know I can get any guy here.

532
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:51,134
Go get them!

533
00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:00,339
You brought your son here today?

534
00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:03,009
-That's right.
-Can we see your son?

535
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:04,735
Yeah, sure.

536
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:06,976
No. No.

537
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:08,819
All right, this is...

538
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:18,568
-What?
-Where did they allow you

539
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:20,816
to get your baby from?
Is your baby from Australia?

540
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:23,852
I was in the Middle East, like,
solving the crisis there.

541
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:25,572
No big deal. Whatever.

542
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:28,498
And I flew back here to America,

543
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:32,249
und I stopped over in this country
called Africa, right?

544
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:35,292
Africa is a continent, not a country, baby.
Get it right.

545
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:37,172
Well, it is full of African-Americans.

546
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:40,576
It's full of Africans.
It's full of people of African descent.

547
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:43,851
No. That's a racist thing to call them.
African-Americans is the right word.

548
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:45,618
No. African-Americans are here.

549
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:48,658
No, they're called
African-Americans, girlfriend.

550
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:49,815
No, fool.

551
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:51,976
All right.
So how did you find your son?

552
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:53,055
I swapped him.

553
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:54,659
-You swapped him?
-What?

554
00:38:56,020 --> 00:38:57,976
Swapped the baby for what?

555
00:38:58,100 --> 00:38:59,692
-For an iPod.
-What?

556
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:02,975
Not just any iPod.

557
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:06,888
One that was, like, limited edition, red.
A U2 iPod. Heard of it?

558
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:11,648
All right, but wait a second.
You are the baby's father now.

559
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:15,295
And you chose to dress that baby up
in a T-shirt that says what?

560
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:16,409
Gayby.

561
00:39:16,540 --> 00:39:18,496
That's not the baby's name, is it?

562
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:21,180
No. I gave him, like,
a traditional African name.

563
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:22,853
So what's the baby's name?

564
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:23,935
O.J.

565
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:29,209
Stand up, please.

566
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:31,808
I think you're using him as an accessory.

567
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:35,410
I think maybe because he's a black baby
that might be your cue,

568
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:38,179
like how some people walk in the park
with dogs to pick up girls,

569
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:39,858
that might be your cue
to get maybe a down-low brother.

570
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:41,777
I don't know. What do you think?

571
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:44,255
I gotta be honest. He's a real dick magnet.

572
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:49,212
You brought some photographs
that you took with the child because...

573
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:51,615
I guess to demonstrate
how much you love the child.

574
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:53,537
We're going to put them up on this screen.

575
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:55,412
That's the first shot.

576
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:01,896
Let's see the next picture.

577
00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:09,652
You're gonna burn in hell for that one.

578
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:10,849
That's some mess.

579
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:14,211
All right. Do we have another photo,
or is that the last one?

580
00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:15,659
There we go.

581
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:18,499
What is going on here?

582
00:40:18,620 --> 00:40:21,851
If I'm having fun,
I want little O.J. to come with me.

583
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:24,290
I want him to have fun with me.

584
00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:28,256
Hold on. Hold on. What's that?

585
00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:30,409
-What is that?
-Someone's scared.

586
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:32,417
-You're making the audience leave.
-They are scared of the truth.

587
00:40:32,540 --> 00:40:35,100
Yes, ma'am? Stand up, please. Go ahead.

588
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:40,690
Listen, I don't see how you can even walk
out of here with that baby in your hands

589
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:44,859
without someone stopping you
and taking that baby out of your possession.

590
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:48,097
All right, well, you know,
there is a finale to this talk show.

591
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:52,577
Please welcome Shatonya Miggins
from the State Child Services Department.

592
00:40:55,940 --> 00:40:57,339
Take the baby.

593
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:02,772
What would be the opinion,
the legal opinion of the state,

594
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:07,257
which is empowered to look after children
and their welfare?

595
00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:09,656
This child is here illegally.

596
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:12,169
No, it's not. I made a deal with the mother.

597
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:15,497
And at this time, we're taking the child
into protective custody.

598
00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:18,930
-You are not doing that. You're not taking...
-The child is going...

599
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:21,491
Get off me. That is my baby.

600
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:25,174
Give him back! Give me my baby back!

601
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:27,211
Give me my baby! Give him back!

602
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:28,614
Come on! Back!

603
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:30,973
Give me my baby back!

604
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:33,898
O.J.! Give me my baby! Give me my...

605
00:41:36,220 --> 00:41:38,290
Give me my baby! O.J.!

606
00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:41,174
O.J.!

607
00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:57,774
O.J.! Give me my baby back!

608
00:42:10,340 --> 00:42:11,932
You want some pie today?

609
00:42:12,060 --> 00:42:15,018
Yeah. I haven't had any carbs for 15 years,

610
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:17,176
since I was, you know, 4 years old.

611
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:19,211
-Since you was 4?
-Yeah.

612
00:42:19,780 --> 00:42:21,611
Is that your boy? He's pretty.

613
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:23,776
That was my boy.
He got taken away today.

614
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:27,210
I'm so sorry. Gosh.
What is he, about 2?

615
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:31,539
I think he was about, I don't know, 6 or...

616
00:42:31,660 --> 00:42:33,059
-Was he? Was he about that age?
-I don't know.

617
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:36,331
He could've been a midget.
So he could have been 10.

618
00:43:41,780 --> 00:43:45,011
Good morning, cowboy. What's your name?

619
00:43:45,780 --> 00:43:46,815
Lutz.

620
00:43:57,820 --> 00:43:59,697
Get that out of my face.

621
00:44:00,060 --> 00:44:02,096
Move that out of my... No, Lutz.

622
00:44:02,220 --> 00:44:04,176
Hello? Engineering.

623
00:44:04,580 --> 00:44:07,140
Hello, I apologise for the state of the room.

624
00:44:07,260 --> 00:44:10,491
But can I assure you,
the toilet is absolutely spotless.

625
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:13,936
Can you look?
The key, I think, is over there, just...

626
00:44:14,060 --> 00:44:15,573
No, I can't do this.

627
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:18,737
Yeah, Brian, I need you up here
on 20 immediately.

628
00:44:19,060 --> 00:44:21,369
Well, no, it's 2 guys
handcuffed together on a bed.

629
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:25,049
And there's some contraption
with a dildo on the end of it.

630
00:44:25,580 --> 00:44:27,969
And they're asking...
They've been staying at the hotel for a while

631
00:44:28,100 --> 00:44:31,649
and wanted to know if I can get the key
for them because they can't get out of bed.

632
00:44:31,780 --> 00:44:33,850
I'm pretty freaking flipping right now.

633
00:44:35,100 --> 00:44:37,056
-Come in.
-Can you tell me what's going on?

634
00:44:37,180 --> 00:44:40,092
You were not meant to see this.
You find the key, I can get out of this.

635
00:44:40,220 --> 00:44:41,539
Now, can you just look under that shelf...

636
00:44:41,660 --> 00:44:44,572
No. This is not what was
supposed to be going on in here.

637
00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:45,849
You're telling me, honey.

638
00:44:45,980 --> 00:44:49,814
I should be chained to a 6'4" Norwegian
with a PhD in sucking dick.

639
00:44:49,940 --> 00:44:50,929
That's not my concern.

640
00:44:52,580 --> 00:44:53,535
Okay, well, listen, one other thing.

641
00:44:53,660 --> 00:44:57,619
Can you switch off the television?
Because I made a fart,

642
00:44:57,740 --> 00:45:01,255
and I am on the verge of buying
Mr. Magorium's Wunderbar Emporium.

643
00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:02,893
That's unfortunate.

644
00:45:03,020 --> 00:45:06,251
No, but I refuse to pay
for Mr. Magorium's Wunderbar Emporium.

645
00:45:06,380 --> 00:45:07,859
I did not press it.

646
00:45:07,980 --> 00:45:09,538
No, I'm afraid we are not
gonna be doing that.

647
00:45:09,660 --> 00:45:12,538
Hey, listen, you. What's your name?
Hi. What's your name?

648
00:45:12,660 --> 00:45:14,093
-No, don't even talk to me.
-You're cute.

649
00:45:14,220 --> 00:45:16,495
You're like a Latino Paul Giamatti.

650
00:45:16,620 --> 00:45:18,497
-Hey, don't talk to me. I'm not talking to you.
-Hey, girlfriend.

651
00:45:21,820 --> 00:45:24,175
Also, great. Maybe they can let us out.

652
00:45:25,860 --> 00:45:29,535
Excuse me, can you unlock us? Please.
Hello? Can you unlock us?

653
00:45:30,460 --> 00:45:31,734
Please, can you unlock us?

654
00:45:31,860 --> 00:45:34,374
Please. My assistant's about to shit
on my balls.

655
00:45:48,940 --> 00:45:49,975
What's going on here?

656
00:45:50,100 --> 00:45:51,738
What does it look like, Paul Blart?

657
00:45:57,140 --> 00:45:58,129
Brüno.

658
00:46:28,180 --> 00:46:29,249
Brüno.

659
00:47:24,420 --> 00:47:28,459
Ich was at a low point.
Brüno had hit rock Arsch.

660
00:47:29,420 --> 00:47:33,811
Lutz had gone, und ich had only
9 Freunds left on MeinSpace.

661
00:47:37,660 --> 00:47:39,616
Lutz! Lutz!

662
00:47:46,740 --> 00:47:49,652
I was about to give up
on my dream of celebrity,

663
00:47:50,420 --> 00:47:52,297
when suddenly it hit me.

664
00:47:55,500 --> 00:47:58,537
All the most famous stars in the world,

665
00:47:58,660 --> 00:48:05,008
Tom Cruise, John Travolta, Kevin Spacey,
they all had one thing in common.

666
00:48:05,940 --> 00:48:07,737
They were all straight.

667
00:48:11,780 --> 00:48:15,773
To become famous,
I would have to quit guys.

668
00:48:16,220 --> 00:48:19,735
Ich just needed to find
a cock-aholics anonymous.

669
00:48:24,060 --> 00:48:27,894
Things have got to change.
I want to become straight.

670
00:48:29,100 --> 00:48:31,330
-Awesome.
-Once I'm straight,

671
00:48:31,460 --> 00:48:33,371
can I still play the clarinet?

672
00:48:34,580 --> 00:48:38,573
If it doesn't remind you
about some of the behaviour

673
00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:41,419
that you engaged in
when you put your lips around it.

674
00:48:41,540 --> 00:48:44,259
If it doesn't remind you of that,
then I say go for it

675
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:46,814
and play the clarinet
with everything inside of you.

676
00:48:46,940 --> 00:48:51,172
If it does remind you of that,
then I say put it down,

677
00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:55,498
give it away, let a friend hold it
until you know in your mind

678
00:48:55,620 --> 00:48:58,578
you're ready to pick it up again
and it wouldn't remind you of that.

679
00:48:58,700 --> 00:49:03,410
Und what about if
I put a flute up my stinker?

680
00:49:04,060 --> 00:49:08,451
That... I wouldn't do that either because it
would remind you of the former lifestyle.

681
00:49:08,580 --> 00:49:12,619
So you don't put any woodwind
instruments up your Arschwitz.

682
00:49:12,740 --> 00:49:15,538
-Absolutely not. You know why?
-Why?

683
00:49:15,660 --> 00:49:18,732
Because that would harm my body.
That would hurt...

684
00:49:18,860 --> 00:49:21,090
-Only if you lose the reed.
-Okay.

685
00:49:21,420 --> 00:49:23,058
Well, that would... That would be bad.

686
00:49:23,180 --> 00:49:26,536
Is there any music that I shouldn't listen to?
Any bands?

687
00:49:26,860 --> 00:49:29,499
Sinead O'Connor. The Indigo Girls.

688
00:49:31,260 --> 00:49:33,137
Of course, the Village People.

689
00:49:33,260 --> 00:49:36,172
When I become straight,
you know, a Kuntmeister,

690
00:49:36,460 --> 00:49:39,099
are there any new hobbies
that I should take up?

691
00:49:39,220 --> 00:49:42,530
-Do you enjoy hiking? Lifting weights?
-Sure.

692
00:49:42,660 --> 00:49:44,332
Man, there's nothing like just working out

693
00:49:44,460 --> 00:49:47,577
and lifting weights
and building your muscles

694
00:49:47,700 --> 00:49:51,215
around some other men who are not gay.

695
00:49:59,420 --> 00:50:04,096
I'm totally irresistible to gay guys.
They see me und they want to schtupp me.

696
00:50:04,380 --> 00:50:07,372
-Right.
-So how do I protect against those guys?

697
00:50:07,580 --> 00:50:10,936
If they get close to you,
hit them and leave the situation.

698
00:50:11,060 --> 00:50:13,130
How do you spot the homosexual?

699
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:14,454
Very hard to do.

700
00:50:14,580 --> 00:50:18,619
Because some of them don't even dress
no different than myself or you.

701
00:50:19,060 --> 00:50:20,379
-Amazing.
-You know?

702
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:22,570
It's kind of like terrorists.

703
00:50:22,780 --> 00:50:26,250
If a terrorist has infiltrated
a police department

704
00:50:26,380 --> 00:50:29,213
and he dresses like the policemen,
how would you know that's him?

705
00:50:29,340 --> 00:50:31,410
What are obvious things
that we can look for?

706
00:50:31,540 --> 00:50:35,613
Obvious is a person that's being
extremely nice to them to start with.

707
00:50:35,900 --> 00:50:40,212
So if someone approaches you in the street
und is being very, very nice to you,

708
00:50:40,340 --> 00:50:42,012
you know that they are a homosexual?

709
00:50:42,140 --> 00:50:43,414
Most likely.

710
00:50:43,900 --> 00:50:48,655
How should I protect myself
from being attacked by homosexuals?

711
00:50:48,860 --> 00:50:52,853
They probably would attack from behind.

712
00:50:53,780 --> 00:50:56,248
So, again, if I am a homosexual,

713
00:50:56,380 --> 00:50:59,019
and I'm just trying to run in und kiss you...

714
00:50:59,500 --> 00:51:02,492
-Boom! You done moved in the wrong range.
-Right.

715
00:51:02,700 --> 00:51:05,260
Let's say the homosexual
has got you on the ground.

716
00:51:05,380 --> 00:51:06,415
Okay.

717
00:51:06,540 --> 00:51:09,293
Und the homosexual, you know,
has got you down here.

718
00:51:09,420 --> 00:51:10,569
-Right.
-I go to pull this down.

719
00:51:10,700 --> 00:51:14,090
-I want to lock this, lock this leg here.
-Touching.

720
00:51:14,220 --> 00:51:15,699
-Yeah.
-Hit with the elbow.

721
00:51:15,820 --> 00:51:17,253
Boom. As I roll across.

722
00:51:17,380 --> 00:51:19,371
How do you protect yourself from a dildo?

723
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:21,058
So let's say I'm trying...

724
00:51:21,180 --> 00:51:22,772
Here, you know.

725
00:51:24,340 --> 00:51:25,819
Like that. You know?

726
00:51:25,940 --> 00:51:27,692
Und disarm the dildo?

727
00:51:27,820 --> 00:51:28,809
Yes.

728
00:51:29,380 --> 00:51:32,099
Is it harder to defend against a black dildo?

729
00:51:32,220 --> 00:51:33,573
-No.
-Great.

730
00:51:33,700 --> 00:51:36,976
One is just as easy as the other
to defend against.

731
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:39,171
-So, I'm attacking.
-Boom.

732
00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:42,740
-Like that.
-Let's say I go down and I...

733
00:51:43,340 --> 00:51:46,093
Trap it, work the knees. Work the elbows.

734
00:51:46,860 --> 00:51:49,454
How do you defend yourself
against the man with 2 dildos?

735
00:51:49,580 --> 00:51:52,014
Coming in. Here. Boom.

736
00:51:52,180 --> 00:51:56,173
Depending on his range. Boom.
Then to his face. Boom.

737
00:51:58,140 --> 00:52:00,654
Okay? Kick around, boom.

738
00:52:02,420 --> 00:52:03,694
He can't do nothing from there.

739
00:52:03,820 --> 00:52:06,573
And if he's just running
with his pants down?

740
00:52:07,260 --> 00:52:10,172
Here. Boom. And then to the eyes.

741
00:52:10,580 --> 00:52:12,298
-Homosexual attacking your bum.
-Leg here.

742
00:52:12,420 --> 00:52:16,129
And then come in and break his arm.
Take it here, take him out.

743
00:52:16,260 --> 00:52:19,172
Break his arms. Boom, break his ribs.
Break his arms.

744
00:52:19,300 --> 00:52:21,939
Okay. Thank you very much. Fantastisch.

745
00:52:22,060 --> 00:52:23,459
-Okay.
-It's very useful.

746
00:52:23,580 --> 00:52:26,856
That's just totally different than
what I've ever tried to, you know, work with.

747
00:52:28,700 --> 00:52:30,452
So you were never gay?

748
00:52:31,340 --> 00:52:34,616
It's ironic that you should have
amazing blow job lips.

749
00:52:36,700 --> 00:52:39,851
Well, these lips were made to praise Jesus.

750
00:52:40,660 --> 00:52:43,811
No, they were made for something else,
but you're just not using it for them.

751
00:52:43,940 --> 00:52:45,134
Well...

752
00:52:45,260 --> 00:52:47,376
Are there any activities you suggest

753
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:50,094
where I'll be surrounded
just by straight guys?

754
00:52:53,820 --> 00:52:57,495
-Let's go! Let's go!
-Let's go! Let's go!

755
00:53:01,180 --> 00:53:02,898
-Push ups! Sit ups!
-Push ups! Sit ups!

756
00:53:05,100 --> 00:53:07,216
-Hurry up. Get in here.
-Was?

757
00:53:07,540 --> 00:53:09,974
Make this bed. Hurry up. Make the bed.

758
00:53:10,100 --> 00:53:11,772
But do you have something,
maybe a double...

759
00:53:11,900 --> 00:53:13,049
Make the bed!

760
00:53:13,180 --> 00:53:15,853
Could you hold the sheet over there?

761
00:53:15,980 --> 00:53:16,935
I'm not holding anything.

762
00:53:17,060 --> 00:53:18,254
-Get down. Get down.
-Was?

763
00:53:18,380 --> 00:53:20,496
I said, get down! Do push ups.

764
00:53:20,700 --> 00:53:23,339
This line right here is
a line that you don't cross.

765
00:53:23,460 --> 00:53:25,815
This is TAC Alley. TAC Officer's...

766
00:53:25,940 --> 00:53:28,056
You're in it again. This is my alley.

767
00:53:28,180 --> 00:53:29,295
I don't want to be in your alley.

768
00:53:29,420 --> 00:53:32,492
Yeah, well, get out of it.
Your finger's in my alley.

769
00:53:33,020 --> 00:53:34,169
Not yet.

770
00:53:37,020 --> 00:53:39,773
By the way, where's your uniform?
Go get your uniform on.

771
00:53:39,900 --> 00:53:40,969
Do it!

772
00:53:41,980 --> 00:53:43,333
Oh, my gosh.

773
00:53:44,660 --> 00:53:45,809
What's up with the scarf?

774
00:53:47,460 --> 00:53:48,415
That is, like, it's my own thing.

775
00:53:48,540 --> 00:53:50,815
Let me introduce you to somebody.
Captain Miles.

776
00:53:50,940 --> 00:53:52,532
Candidate, what are you doing?

777
00:53:52,660 --> 00:53:54,218
Stand at the position of attention, candidate.

778
00:53:54,340 --> 00:53:56,729
-Do it! Do it!
-Head and eyes straight forward, candidate.

779
00:53:56,860 --> 00:53:59,215
Head and eyes straight forward.
Stand still, candidate.

780
00:53:59,340 --> 00:54:00,455
That is not part of the uniform, candidate.
You need to take that off.

781
00:54:02,220 --> 00:54:04,495
This outfit is too matchy-matchy as it is,

782
00:54:04,620 --> 00:54:08,295
and so I was just trying to break it up
with some simple horizontal lines.

783
00:54:08,420 --> 00:54:11,093
Do you have an attitude, candidate?
Do we detect an attitude?

784
00:54:11,220 --> 00:54:14,610
-Sir, she's got an attitude.
-What?

785
00:54:14,740 --> 00:54:17,049
Sir Officer Candidate,
did you just call me "she"?

786
00:54:17,180 --> 00:54:19,091
-Get down, candidate! Now!
-Do it!

787
00:54:19,220 --> 00:54:21,256
What type belt is that, candidate?

788
00:54:21,380 --> 00:54:22,574
What is that?

789
00:54:22,700 --> 00:54:24,452
-D&G.
-What is D&G?

790
00:54:24,580 --> 00:54:26,457
Dolce und Gabbana. Hello?

791
00:54:26,580 --> 00:54:27,569
-"Hello"?
-"Hello"?

792
00:54:27,700 --> 00:54:29,099
-Front in the rest position.
-Get down, you!

793
00:54:29,380 --> 00:54:33,168
Sir Officer Candidate,
you deserve a medal for exceptional skin.

794
00:54:33,860 --> 00:54:36,055
What are you talking...
What are you trying to say, candidate?

795
00:54:36,180 --> 00:54:40,810
Sir Officer Candidate, you could be a general
in the Bitch Army the way you're going.

796
00:54:40,940 --> 00:54:42,578
-Did you use profanity again?
-Did you use profanity?

797
00:54:42,700 --> 00:54:43,849
But you're being really nasty.

798
00:54:43,980 --> 00:54:47,575
The OC guide states that I will not
use profanity while I'm at OCS.

799
00:54:47,700 --> 00:54:50,260
Yes, mein Führer. Yes, Officer Candidate.

800
00:54:50,380 --> 00:54:52,496
-Hurry up!
-Hurry up! Let's go!

801
00:54:53,420 --> 00:54:54,773
-Yeah, this is mine.
-You better help your buddy.

802
00:54:58,460 --> 00:55:00,371
Get out of my TAC Alley.

803
00:55:01,340 --> 00:55:02,455
Get out of my TAC Alley.

804
00:55:05,660 --> 00:55:07,855
-Hurry up! Hurry up!
-Move over there!

805
00:55:12,860 --> 00:55:14,213
-Salute!
-Salute with your right hand.

806
00:55:14,340 --> 00:55:15,329
Salute with your right hand.

807
00:55:15,460 --> 00:55:17,132
-That's not a salute.
-That's not a salute.

808
00:55:17,260 --> 00:55:18,215
That's not a salute.

809
00:55:19,860 --> 00:55:22,772
Can I tell you about the person
that changed my life?

810
00:55:22,900 --> 00:55:24,697
Was it Karl Lagerfeld?

811
00:55:24,980 --> 00:55:29,132
No, actually, his name is Jesus.
Jesus is in this room right now.

812
00:55:29,260 --> 00:55:32,377
He never leaves us. He never forsakes us.
He's here.

813
00:55:32,740 --> 00:55:33,809
Amazing.

814
00:55:33,940 --> 00:55:35,419
That's exactly right. He's amazing.

815
00:55:35,540 --> 00:55:39,055
You want to be famous.
You'll be one that's so famous, Brüno,

816
00:55:39,180 --> 00:55:42,616
you will prepare the way
for other young men all over the world

817
00:55:42,740 --> 00:55:46,494
who want to come out of the homosexual
lifestyle and make a change in their lives.

818
00:55:46,620 --> 00:55:49,339
And they'll say, "If Brüno can do it,
then I can do it.

819
00:55:49,460 --> 00:55:51,530
"How did he change?
How did you change, Brüno?"

820
00:55:51,660 --> 00:55:54,333
And they'll say, "It's Jesus. He changed me."

821
00:55:54,460 --> 00:55:56,416
But he wants to come into
your heart right now.

822
00:55:56,540 --> 00:55:58,735
Are you ready to make that change?

823
00:55:58,860 --> 00:56:00,700
Are you hitting on me?

824
00:56:01,700 --> 00:56:03,019
No, I'm not.

825
00:56:03,780 --> 00:56:08,137
Okay, good, 'cause I just...
That was, like, really hot, that whole speech.

826
00:56:09,820 --> 00:56:11,651
Are there any outdoor activities

827
00:56:11,780 --> 00:56:14,977
that I should do
if I want to become straight?

828
00:56:15,220 --> 00:56:16,539
Absolutely.

829
00:56:17,180 --> 00:56:18,454
-Hi.
-Hello.

830
00:56:21,780 --> 00:56:23,179
-Mike. Brüno.
-Brüno.

831
00:56:23,660 --> 00:56:24,615
Hey. Great.

832
00:56:24,740 --> 00:56:26,298
-I'm Donny.
-Brüno.

833
00:56:27,220 --> 00:56:28,335
Robert.

834
00:56:28,660 --> 00:56:30,730
-You ever been hunting?
-I've never killed an animal.

835
00:56:32,740 --> 00:56:33,889
Although, I did once
suffocate a hamster in Mykonos.

836
00:56:38,340 --> 00:56:42,049
The women, eh? Do you prefer the vagina
or the mammary glands?

837
00:56:43,220 --> 00:56:45,370
-I prefer the vagina.
-Me, too.

838
00:56:45,780 --> 00:56:47,930
I love a woman with a vagina.

839
00:56:48,060 --> 00:56:49,049
Yeah.

840
00:56:49,660 --> 00:56:50,809
My favourite.

841
00:56:50,940 --> 00:56:52,578
Didn't see anything.

842
00:56:53,420 --> 00:56:55,775
We were just talking about vaginas.

843
00:56:55,940 --> 00:56:56,895
About what?

844
00:56:57,020 --> 00:56:58,851
Vaginas. The woman's vagina.

845
00:57:01,740 --> 00:57:05,050
Sharing stories
and saying how much we enjoy them.

846
00:57:05,180 --> 00:57:06,295
Yes.

847
00:57:06,620 --> 00:57:08,212
Really fantastisch.

848
00:57:08,740 --> 00:57:10,571
Really wonderful things.

849
00:57:11,660 --> 00:57:13,173
It's my favourite.

850
00:57:18,700 --> 00:57:20,258
This is wonderful.

851
00:57:22,260 --> 00:57:24,091
This is what rabbit look like.

852
00:57:29,740 --> 00:57:33,653
Look at the 4 of us.
We are so like the Sex and the City girls.

853
00:57:34,740 --> 00:57:36,651
No, we aren't, either.

854
00:57:37,740 --> 00:57:39,378
Which one are you, Donny?

855
00:57:39,500 --> 00:57:41,855
I ain't any one of them. I'm Donny.

856
00:57:43,060 --> 00:57:45,528
That is such a Samantha thing to say.

857
00:57:49,620 --> 00:57:52,532
I've never been
out of the city before.

858
00:57:52,660 --> 00:57:55,458
You haven't? How's it feel?

859
00:57:56,020 --> 00:57:57,897
I feel a bit vulnerable.

860
00:57:59,900 --> 00:58:03,210
You know, I'm 19 years old,
I've got a perfect body.

861
00:58:04,260 --> 00:58:07,616
You know, I really don't want to wake up
tomorrow morning und find

862
00:58:08,820 --> 00:58:11,050
that I'm torn in my Arschenholer.

863
00:58:13,900 --> 00:58:16,130
You probably ain't the only one.

864
00:58:16,580 --> 00:58:18,332
Me, either, definitely.

865
00:58:19,780 --> 00:58:22,294
There's so many stars in the sky.

866
00:58:23,220 --> 00:58:24,619
Full of them.

867
00:58:25,780 --> 00:58:28,772
Makes you think of
all the hot guys in the world.

868
00:58:56,340 --> 00:58:58,808
Do we all share one tent
or what's more sensible?

869
00:58:58,940 --> 00:59:00,168
I hope not.

870
01:00:02,580 --> 01:00:04,332
All right, God damn it.

871
01:00:07,500 --> 01:00:10,060
Reverend BJ found me
too much of a handful

872
01:00:10,180 --> 01:00:12,011
and put me in touch with one of his chums.

873
01:00:13,300 --> 01:00:14,858
You look decent in that.

874
01:00:16,780 --> 01:00:18,293
Look like a straight guy, how's that?

875
01:00:20,980 --> 01:00:22,732
Women are good for us.

876
01:00:24,180 --> 01:00:26,774
They're good even though

877
01:00:26,900 --> 01:00:30,210
they appear to us
to be terribly conventional.

878
01:00:30,780 --> 01:00:34,455
And we find that somewhat irritating

879
01:00:36,300 --> 01:00:38,689
that they complain so much.

880
01:00:39,580 --> 01:00:41,457
-Right.
-But we need that.

881
01:00:41,940 --> 01:00:45,296
We need many of the things

882
01:00:45,820 --> 01:00:51,292
that, at first glance,
are annoying and irritating.

883
01:00:52,460 --> 01:00:55,497
And women often don't stick to the point.

884
01:00:55,620 --> 01:01:00,057
They're often talking about one thing
and then another and then another,

885
01:01:00,500 --> 01:01:04,129
and they never get back to the first point
maybe ever.

886
01:01:05,540 --> 01:01:10,216
I am repulsed by the idea
of making the sex with a woman.

887
01:01:11,540 --> 01:01:16,136
The important thing is to be around women,

888
01:01:16,260 --> 01:01:20,492
somewhat, that you find tolerable
or interesting

889
01:01:21,140 --> 01:01:23,938
and give them a chance to seduce you.

890
01:01:30,620 --> 01:01:32,133
How did you get into it?

891
01:01:32,260 --> 01:01:33,249
We, actually, our first time was on our...

892
01:01:34,500 --> 01:01:36,138
-Our honeymoon.
-Yeah.

893
01:01:36,300 --> 01:01:40,259
Of all nights for us to swing,
the first time was for our honeymoon.

894
01:01:41,940 --> 01:01:44,295
Und what is your favourite position?

895
01:01:45,340 --> 01:01:48,138
That would be missionary or reverse cowgirl.

896
01:01:48,660 --> 01:01:50,651
What's reverse cowgirl?

897
01:01:51,420 --> 01:01:52,853
Show me. I'll pretend to be the woman.

898
01:01:52,980 --> 01:01:53,935
Like, I'm sitting here, and...

899
01:01:54,060 --> 01:01:57,575
Yeah, and so, if I'm the woman...
Don't worry. Yeah, so what?

900
01:01:57,700 --> 01:01:58,735
You'd be sitting like that,

901
01:01:58,860 --> 01:02:01,090
-and that's called reverse cowgirl.
-Right. Right.

902
01:02:01,220 --> 01:02:03,893
And then when you're facing me,
that's called cowgirl.

903
01:02:04,660 --> 01:02:07,254
This one here is cowgirl or reverse cowgirl?

904
01:02:07,380 --> 01:02:08,449
This is cowgirl.

905
01:02:08,580 --> 01:02:11,140
And then when you're turned
the opposite way, it's reverse cowgirl.

906
01:02:16,740 --> 01:02:18,253
Und what other positions are there?

907
01:02:18,380 --> 01:02:20,496
-Power driver.
-Right.

908
01:02:20,620 --> 01:02:21,735
69.

909
01:02:21,860 --> 01:02:23,339
But this is the girl's position.

910
01:02:24,580 --> 01:02:25,899
You don't want to be like this
if you're a guy.

911
01:02:26,020 --> 01:02:27,897
There's missionary, doggy style.

912
01:02:28,020 --> 01:02:29,169
So what's doggy style like?

913
01:02:29,300 --> 01:02:31,689
You'd be bent over, like a dog does it.

914
01:02:31,820 --> 01:02:33,094
Yeah. Like that?

915
01:02:33,220 --> 01:02:35,131
All right, and then
what would you be doing?

916
01:02:35,260 --> 01:02:36,693
If you was a woman,
I would be humping you.

917
01:02:36,820 --> 01:02:38,458
-No, show me.
-I'm not gonna show you.

918
01:02:38,580 --> 01:02:39,854
-You're a man.
-Don't be a faggot.

919
01:02:39,980 --> 01:02:42,414
Come on. What's the big deal?
It's just a couple of guys.

920
01:02:42,580 --> 01:02:44,616
I'd be humping you like that.

921
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:47,451
I can't wait to do this to a woman.

922
01:02:57,740 --> 01:03:00,208
Anybody want a sandwich or something?

923
01:03:03,500 --> 01:03:05,650
Yeah. Great.

924
01:03:07,500 --> 01:03:09,092
Very good. You've got great hair actually.

925
01:03:09,220 --> 01:03:10,892
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

926
01:03:19,700 --> 01:03:20,894
That was great.

927
01:03:22,060 --> 01:03:24,494
-Oh, yeah.
-Good boy.

928
01:03:26,860 --> 01:03:28,088
Fuck, yeah.

929
01:03:29,940 --> 01:03:31,498
You're doing a great job.

930
01:03:31,620 --> 01:03:32,814
Thank you.

931
01:03:33,980 --> 01:03:36,175
Come on, Jack, look me in the eyes.

932
01:03:36,300 --> 01:03:38,495
Look me in the eye. You can do this.

933
01:03:41,660 --> 01:03:42,615
Dude.

934
01:03:43,820 --> 01:03:45,617
Why would he look you in the eyes
when he's looking at a pussy?

935
01:03:45,740 --> 01:03:48,652
-Why would he look you in the eyes?
-No, no. Just for concentration.

936
01:03:48,780 --> 01:03:51,658
-He does not look in a guy's...
-I don't need you for concentration, okay?

937
01:03:51,780 --> 01:03:54,248
-Look her in the eye.
-This is a fucking swingers party. Okay?

938
01:03:54,380 --> 01:03:56,018
If you don't want pussy,
if you don't want fucking...

939
01:03:56,140 --> 01:03:58,017
-No, I want...
-Then quit fucking touching me

940
01:03:58,140 --> 01:04:00,859
and quit telling me
to look at you in the eye. Okay?

941
01:04:00,980 --> 01:04:03,540
I didn't come here
for no fucking queer shit. Okay?

942
01:04:03,660 --> 01:04:05,059
-Me, neither.
-Okay.

943
01:04:05,180 --> 01:04:06,533
-Let's keep it at that then.
-Cool.

944
01:04:06,660 --> 01:04:09,458
This is a fucking swingers party.
Right, guys?

945
01:04:09,580 --> 01:04:11,571
I see what the fuck you're doing, dude.

946
01:04:11,700 --> 01:04:12,769
-Hi.
-Did he not try to pull

947
01:04:12,900 --> 01:04:14,458
-that queer shit on you out there?
-Hi. How you doing?

948
01:04:14,580 --> 01:04:16,730
I don't need this motherfucker
touching me on the back,

949
01:04:16,860 --> 01:04:18,816
telling me to look him
in the fucking eye. Right?

950
01:04:18,940 --> 01:04:22,250
-I was just going to the kitchen.
-I know, yeah. Come on.

951
01:04:23,060 --> 01:04:25,938
What's this shit? Let's take this off.

952
01:04:26,820 --> 01:04:29,539
Let's maybe we get
to know each other a little.

953
01:04:29,660 --> 01:04:32,174
-I think you broke that, actually.
-I don't give a fuck.

954
01:04:32,300 --> 01:04:35,849
Yeah, there is...
Let's get to know each other a little bit first.

955
01:04:37,100 --> 01:04:38,135
Know each other? What?

956
01:04:38,260 --> 01:04:40,410
You must produce a lot of milk.

957
01:04:40,740 --> 01:04:43,049
I don't want you to do something
that you'll regret.

958
01:04:43,180 --> 01:04:46,490
You wake up tomorrow, you've lost
your virginity, and you feel ashamed.

959
01:04:46,620 --> 01:04:49,771
You know, let's take this a little slower.

960
01:04:49,900 --> 01:04:51,856
-We should reschedule.
-Sit the fuck down.

961
01:04:51,980 --> 01:04:54,130
Sit the fuck down. Don't fuck around!

962
01:04:55,900 --> 01:04:58,130
No, let's do this the right way.

963
01:04:59,580 --> 01:05:01,969
I go, and I sit down with your father,
we talk about this.

964
01:05:02,100 --> 01:05:03,453
-If he gives his permission...
-What?

965
01:05:03,580 --> 01:05:04,854
Would you quit being a little bitch here

966
01:05:04,980 --> 01:05:07,699
and take your little briefs off
before I fucking rip them?

967
01:05:07,940 --> 01:05:09,339
Wait. Yes.

968
01:05:09,460 --> 01:05:10,449
-Yeah.
-Fine.

969
01:05:10,580 --> 01:05:11,569
-Thanks.
-Okay. Great.

970
01:05:11,700 --> 01:05:13,497
I don't like this little shit.

971
01:05:13,620 --> 01:05:14,769
Yes, well, I want to really make
this heterosexual sex.

972
01:05:16,540 --> 01:05:17,689
It's going to be fantastisch!

973
01:05:17,820 --> 01:05:21,574
Do as I say. Take that fucking shit off now!

974
01:05:22,780 --> 01:05:24,975
-Don't... You fold them.
-Fuck.

975
01:05:25,100 --> 01:05:27,739
You gotta fold that neatly.
You don't treat suede like that. It stains.

976
01:05:27,860 --> 01:05:30,135
Sit the fuck down. Take it off!

977
01:05:30,260 --> 01:05:33,570
I've got an idea.
Let's play a little bit of dress-up here.

978
01:05:33,700 --> 01:05:34,655
It will be erotisch.

979
01:05:34,780 --> 01:05:36,532
What is this?
You gonna dress me like a man?

980
01:05:36,660 --> 01:05:37,979
No, it's just a beard.

981
01:05:38,100 --> 01:05:39,533
-Am I supposed to wear a beard?
-It's just a...

982
01:05:39,660 --> 01:05:40,934
Come on, it will be fun.

983
01:05:41,060 --> 01:05:42,175
I don't need a beard.

984
01:05:42,300 --> 01:05:43,619
Take it off! Now!

985
01:05:43,740 --> 01:05:44,889
Once you put the...

986
01:05:47,460 --> 01:05:49,735
-Fuck! Take it off.
-Okay. I'm...

987
01:05:49,860 --> 01:05:50,895
-Okay, I'm going to do this.
-Right now!

988
01:05:51,020 --> 01:05:53,580
Get on your fucking knees
and suck my spike here, bitch.

989
01:05:56,140 --> 01:05:58,131
Okay. Help!

990
01:05:58,460 --> 01:06:00,052
Don't fuck around!

991
01:06:03,220 --> 01:06:04,812
Don't call me gay!

992
01:06:05,340 --> 01:06:09,174
I'm gonna become straight.
I'm gonna become über straight.

993
01:06:10,260 --> 01:06:13,013
I'm gonna be the straightest man
who's ever lived.

994
01:06:13,140 --> 01:06:16,928
Und then I'll be famous.
You'll see. You'll see.

995
01:06:39,860 --> 01:06:40,849
What's up, Arkansas?
How's everybody doing?

996
01:06:45,660 --> 01:06:47,890
You guys ready to see
a little ass kicking tonight?

997
01:06:49,580 --> 01:06:52,777
Make some noise, everybody.
Put your hands together. Make some noise

998
01:06:52,900 --> 01:06:57,769
for the host of the brand-new TV show,
Straight Dave's Man Slammin' Maxout.

999
01:06:58,020 --> 01:07:01,933
Give it up for Straight Dave!

1000
01:07:03,260 --> 01:07:06,889
Straight Dave. Straight Dave.

1001
01:07:25,580 --> 01:07:28,617
Are you ready for
some man-slamming action?

1002
01:07:30,060 --> 01:07:33,530
Who's ready for
an old-fashioned heterofest?

1003
01:07:36,020 --> 01:07:39,899
Are you 100% hetero like me?

1004
01:07:48,020 --> 01:07:50,488
Who out there is proud to be straight?

1005
01:07:52,540 --> 01:07:55,293
Let me hear you say straight pride.

1006
01:07:55,540 --> 01:07:56,768
-Straight pride.
-Straight pride.

1007
01:07:56,900 --> 01:07:58,458
Straight pride.

1008
01:07:58,580 --> 01:07:59,899
-Straight pride.
-Straight pride.

1009
01:08:00,300 --> 01:08:03,849
I am so straight
that when I bought my house,

1010
01:08:03,980 --> 01:08:07,256
the first thing I did
was brick up the back door.

1011
01:08:10,540 --> 01:08:14,419
You know why?
Because my asshole's just for shitting.

1012
01:08:14,540 --> 01:08:16,019
Let me hear you say that.

1013
01:08:16,140 --> 01:08:18,290
-My asshole's just for shitting.
-My asshole's just for shitting.

1014
01:08:19,220 --> 01:08:22,417
It's great to have an evening
with straight people.

1015
01:08:22,540 --> 01:08:25,213
It's great not to have any fags here.

1016
01:08:25,340 --> 01:08:26,853
You're a faggot!

1017
01:08:27,940 --> 01:08:29,771
Who called me a faggot?

1018
01:08:30,300 --> 01:08:34,088
Whoever called me a faggot come up here,
and I'll beat your Arsch.

1019
01:08:34,540 --> 01:08:37,498
Who called Straight Dave a faggot?
Come up here.

1020
01:08:47,100 --> 01:08:48,419
Let him in.

1021
01:08:54,780 --> 01:08:58,090
Who wants to see me beat this fag's ass?

1022
01:09:00,060 --> 01:09:02,255
Who wants me to beat this...

1023
01:09:04,500 --> 01:09:05,455
Fuck him up!

1024
01:09:05,580 --> 01:09:06,808
Get him, motherfucker!

1025
01:09:09,900 --> 01:09:11,731
Beat his fucking ass!

1026
01:09:27,900 --> 01:09:29,253
Kick his ass!

1027
01:09:54,620 --> 01:09:55,939
Fucking fag!

1028
01:09:59,260 --> 01:10:02,570
-Homo! Queer fags!
-Motherfuckers!

1029
01:10:18,820 --> 01:10:20,811
Stop! Stop!

1030
01:10:27,420 --> 01:10:30,890
Get out of my town. You all are sick.

1031
01:10:34,100 --> 01:10:37,934
Tell him we don't have no faggots here
in Arkansas. Take that shit somewhere else.

1032
01:10:39,620 --> 01:10:42,088
You pussy-ass faggot motherfucker!

1033
01:11:04,580 --> 01:11:08,016
Fuck that shit! Fuck that shit!

1034
01:11:08,460 --> 01:11:11,691
Fuck that shit! Fuck that shit!

1035
01:11:28,740 --> 01:11:33,973
The footage went everywhere,
und Brüno became über famous.

1036
01:11:35,460 --> 01:11:39,248
As for Lutz,
we decided to get married in California.

1037
01:11:40,220 --> 01:11:43,417
But because of the law,
we had to be a bit inventive.

1038
01:11:43,780 --> 01:11:47,136
I feel this is the biggest step
you'll ever make in your lifetime.

1039
01:11:47,260 --> 01:11:48,978
-It's a very big moment.
-That's right.

1040
01:11:49,100 --> 01:11:52,058
Am I going to be able to meet her
before we actually start?

1041
01:11:52,180 --> 01:11:53,169
Sure.

1042
01:12:05,500 --> 01:12:08,731
I... I don't marry 2 men or 2 women.

1043
01:12:08,980 --> 01:12:12,256
If she's a man,
then how did it give birth to our son?

1044
01:12:16,580 --> 01:12:17,569
You gave birth to a little black child?

1045
01:12:17,700 --> 01:12:18,689
Yes.

1046
01:12:19,700 --> 01:12:21,736
When did you have the baby?

1047
01:12:22,100 --> 01:12:25,058
I don't even know why
I'm asking that question.

1048
01:12:26,180 --> 01:12:28,375
But even though marriage
was a nicht-nicht,

1049
01:12:28,500 --> 01:12:30,695
we weren't gonna let it get us down.

1050
01:12:30,820 --> 01:12:31,855
We were happy. We had each other.

1051
01:12:33,620 --> 01:12:34,848
And we had O.J. back,

1052
01:12:35,420 --> 01:12:37,980
although he did cost us a MacBook Pro.

1053
01:12:38,740 --> 01:12:41,049
Plus, ich was now so famous

1054
01:12:41,180 --> 01:12:45,139
that I was able to record
mein very own charity video.

1055
01:12:47,019 --> 01:12:52,819


1056
01:12:53,780 --> 01:12:55,372
I've written a song

1057
01:12:55,900 --> 01:13:00,416
that I hope is gonna
bring the world together

1058
01:13:06,260 --> 01:13:09,536
Put down your guns and bombs

1059
01:13:10,380 --> 01:13:13,338
and just make love forever

1060
01:13:13,860 --> 01:13:15,134
Okay, then.

1061
01:13:19,260 --> 01:13:22,058
He's come to heal the world

1062
01:13:23,060 --> 01:13:25,210
and make all nations calmer

1063
01:13:31,660 --> 01:13:35,255
I am the Austrian Jesus

1064
01:13:35,700 --> 01:13:38,897
He is the white Obama

1065
01:13:39,460 --> 01:13:41,098
He's the white Obama

1066
01:13:44,540 --> 01:13:47,418
War's just based on hate and fear

1067
01:13:47,540 --> 01:13:50,657
Stop fighting, North and South Korea

1068
01:13:51,460 --> 01:13:54,338
You're both basically Chinese

1069
01:13:54,620 --> 01:13:57,009
And he's Brüno, dove of peace

1070
01:13:57,140 --> 01:13:59,813
Hey, yo, Brüno, where the bitches at?

1071
01:14:00,660 --> 01:14:03,174
You are Brüno, dove of peace

1072
01:14:03,300 --> 01:14:06,531
You do it, fashion model
You got the cute hos

1073
01:14:06,980 --> 01:14:10,529
You are Brüno, dove of peace

1074
01:14:11,780 --> 01:14:13,372
You know, I love black guys.
I'm a chocoholic.

1075
01:14:13,500 --> 01:14:16,492
Du bist Brüno, dove of peace

1076
01:14:16,620 --> 01:14:18,178
Brüno wants peace.

1077
01:14:18,380 --> 01:14:22,089
Either we gonna have peace,
or we gonna have motherfucking war.

1078
01:14:22,780 --> 01:14:25,578
I have a dream for the Third World

1079
01:14:26,300 --> 01:14:29,610
Clean water, food and teaching

1080
01:14:35,220 --> 01:14:38,530
In every village and every town

1081
01:14:39,260 --> 01:14:42,218
a place for anal bleaching

1082
01:14:48,020 --> 01:14:51,330
We need to rid the world of hunger

1083
01:14:51,460 --> 01:14:54,611
I'm like Bono, except much younger

1084
01:14:55,140 --> 01:14:58,018
He's only 19

1085
01:14:58,140 --> 01:15:00,779
Ich bin Brüno, dove of peace

1086
01:15:02,900 --> 01:15:05,892
Hey, hey, he gay, he gay...

1087
01:15:06,860 --> 01:15:07,849
Okay.

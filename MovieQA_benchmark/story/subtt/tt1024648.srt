1
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,847
This is the Persian Empire

2
00:00:41,528 --> 00:00:43,323
known today as Iran.

3
00:00:44,511 --> 00:00:48,371
For 2,500 years, this land
was ruled by a series of kings

4
00:00:48,776 --> 00:00:50,646
known as "Shahs".

5
00:00:51,553 --> 00:00:55,877
In 1950, the people of Iran
elected Mohammad Mosaddegh

6
00:00:56,127 --> 00:00:59,057
a secular democrat, as prime minister.

7
00:00:59,527 --> 00:01:02,857
He nationalized British and US
petroleum holdings,

8
00:01:03,127 --> 00:01:05,791
returning Iran's oil to its people.

9
00:01:07,327 --> 00:01:09,057
But in 1953,

10
00:01:09,187 --> 00:01:11,946
the US and Great Britain
engineered a coup d'etat

11
00:01:12,017 --> 00:01:16,991
that deposed Mosaddegh,
and installed Reza Pahlavi as Shah.

12
00:01:18,279 --> 00:01:21,609
The young child was known
for opulence and excess.

13
00:01:21,966 --> 00:01:24,694
His wife was rumored to bathe in milk,

14
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:29,018
while the Shah had his lunches
flown in by concord from Paris.

15
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,825
The people starved.

16
00:01:34,187 --> 00:01:37,700
The Shah kept power through
his ruthless internal police,

17
00:01:37,857 --> 00:01:39,187
the Savak.

18
00:01:39,649 --> 00:01:42,708
An era of torture and fear began.

19
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:48,454
He then began a campaign
to westernize Iran,

20
00:01:49,567 --> 00:01:53,475
enraging the the mostly
traditional Shia population.

21
00:01:54,002 --> 00:01:58,302
In 1979,
the people of Iran overthrew the Shah.

22
00:02:00,331 --> 00:02:04,871
The exiled cleric, Ayatollah Khomeini,
returned to rule Iran.

23
00:02:07,257 --> 00:02:13,085
It descended into score settling,
death squads and chaos.

24
00:02:15,657 --> 00:02:19,527
Dying of cancer, the Shah
was given asylum in the US.

25
00:02:21,371 --> 00:02:25,191
The Iranian people took
to the streets outside the US embassy,

26
00:02:25,261 --> 00:02:28,862
demanding that the Shah
be returned, tried…

27
00:02:30,271 --> 00:02:31,174
and hanged.

28
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:43,184
The carnival is a
little bigger today, huh?

29
00:03:45,275 --> 00:03:47,638
The windows are supposed
to be bulletproof, right?

30
00:03:48,527 --> 00:03:49,977
They have never been tested.

31
00:03:50,321 --> 00:03:52,471
Okay, you just need to finish filling out

32
00:03:52,647 --> 00:03:53,997
this section here.

33
00:04:46,797 --> 00:04:48,377
We need some security.

34
00:04:48,477 --> 00:04:50,443
Yes, it is your responsibility-

35
00:04:50,451 --> 00:04:52,207
They drew over the walls.

36
00:04:52,297 --> 00:04:53,397
We should all split.

37
00:04:53,577 --> 00:04:54,868
I'm gonna close up my office.

38
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:15,608
My God!

39
00:05:16,707 --> 00:05:17,907
Marins to Number 1.

40
00:05:18,177 --> 00:05:18,867
Full back.

41
00:05:18,889 --> 00:05:19,718
– Look, I need police,
– Can anyone hear me?

42
00:05:19,719 --> 00:05:20,637
– I need police right now.
– We're on the second floor.

43
00:05:20,647 --> 00:05:21,418
– You understand me?
– We need help.

44
00:05:21,427 --> 00:05:22,557
Right now, goddamn it!

45
00:05:22,869 --> 00:05:24,565
Can anybody hear me?

46
00:05:24,566 --> 00:05:25,397
There is a breach.

47
00:05:27,585 --> 00:05:29,028
Burn everything! Burn it, now!

48
00:05:29,036 --> 00:05:31,997
Alright burn everything,
all the files, file cabinets, safe.

49
00:05:46,787 --> 00:05:47,885
Lets get a cart over here.

50
00:05:47,886 --> 00:05:48,987
Burn it all, come on!

51
00:05:49,017 --> 00:05:51,375
Burn everything, including
the classified. Everything!

52
00:05:56,847 --> 00:05:58,697
Don't fucking shoot anybody.

53
00:05:58,932 --> 00:06:01,440
You don't want to be
the son of a bitch who started the war.

54
00:06:01,679 --> 00:06:03,392
They need an hour to burn the classified.

55
00:06:04,443 --> 00:06:05,345
I need you to hold.

56
00:06:05,647 --> 00:06:06,857
If you shoot one person,

57
00:06:07,347 --> 00:06:09,456
they're gonna kill every
single one of us in here.

58
00:06:18,547 --> 00:06:21,324
I'm telling you if we're going to go,
we need to go now!

59
00:06:21,331 --> 00:06:23,476
– And we need to make a decision, and-
– Joe can we- Joe can we wait,

60
00:06:23,486 --> 00:06:25,237
can we wait until
the Iranian police come?

61
00:06:25,243 --> 00:06:26,657
– No!
– They're not coming.

62
00:06:27,457 --> 00:06:28,517
How do you know they're not coming?

63
00:06:28,527 --> 00:06:29,540
They may well be coming.

64
00:06:29,556 --> 00:06:30,846
The police have abandoned their post-

65
00:06:30,854 --> 00:06:33,375
If the police are not coming, okay,
then the army's gonna come.

66
00:06:33,383 --> 00:06:34,217
The Prime Minister is not gonna let
the embassy be taken over.

67
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:36,835
I understand. The Prime Minister
may come tomorrow,

68
00:06:36,836 --> 00:06:38,315
but the Komiteh are here today.

69
00:06:38,316 --> 00:06:40,476
Alright, is there- is there any value
that we're waiting 15-

70
00:06:40,487 --> 00:06:41,246
Look at me!

71
00:06:41,457 --> 00:06:42,547
No one is coming.

72
00:06:42,573 --> 00:06:43,972
Burn it!
We have forty minutes.

73
00:06:46,947 --> 00:06:49,447
Get it down to the incinerator,
in the vault. Now!

74
00:06:49,504 --> 00:06:51,314
Tear gas is a last resort only.

75
00:06:51,348 --> 00:06:54,007
<i>I repeat: only if you're under threat.</i>

76
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:35,913
In here, we are in America right now,
outside of these doors, we are in Iran!

77
00:07:35,914 --> 00:07:36,842
I'm not going out there!

78
00:07:36,843 --> 00:07:38,610
– They're not safe here.
-Alright, first let's get these-

79
00:07:38,627 --> 00:07:40,785
If they get caught
applying for visas to the US…

80
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:42,275
You know what, lets-
lets wait five minutes.

81
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:44,657
We're in the only building
with direct access to the street,

82
00:07:44,658 --> 00:07:46,657
if we're going to go,
then we need to go now!

83
00:07:46,897 --> 00:07:48,401
– Yeah, I'm in.
– Yeah.

84
00:07:48,434 --> 00:07:49,235
Yeah, lets go.

85
00:07:54,422 --> 00:07:55,327
I'm going outside.

86
00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:56,257
Why?

87
00:07:56,407 --> 00:07:57,627
To reason them.

88
00:08:24,325 --> 00:08:25,254
Open the door!

89
00:08:26,389 --> 00:08:27,537
Open the door!

90
00:08:27,957 --> 00:08:29,537
Open this goddamn door!

91
00:08:31,413 --> 00:08:33,677
You said you wanna see the world, Elton?

92
00:08:34,053 --> 00:08:36,545
Let me in! Let me in!

93
00:08:44,573 --> 00:08:46,391
– Burn it all, come on!
– Right come on, guys!

94
00:08:46,405 --> 00:08:48,867
The safe and the filing cabinets get long.

95
00:08:56,587 --> 00:08:58,887
All four drawers,
I want them shredded, right now!

96
00:08:58,888 --> 00:09:00,283
But the shred not fast enough.

97
00:09:01,194 --> 00:09:03,306
Guys, get the visa plates.

98
00:09:04,266 --> 00:09:06,768
All four, and anything
else you see out there.

99
00:09:07,285 --> 00:09:09,125
If in doubt, you shred it.

100
00:09:11,505 --> 00:09:14,304
We've got ten minutes,
lets go, go, go, everything!

101
00:09:24,049 --> 00:09:24,793
Get the shredder.

102
00:09:24,815 --> 00:09:26,420
There are no police.

103
00:10:31,247 --> 00:10:32,054
– Okay.
– Come on.

104
00:10:32,062 --> 00:10:34,205
– Where do we go?
– We gotta get off the streets.

105
00:10:34,693 --> 00:10:36,189
This way, up here to the left.

106
00:11:06,665 --> 00:11:08,347
These fucks hit us,
we can't hit 'em back?

107
00:11:08,348 --> 00:11:10,347
Mossaddegh, we did it to them first.

108
00:11:10,376 --> 00:11:12,437
The Soviets would put up with this shit,
they would fucking invade them.

109
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:13,082
Shaffer!

110
00:11:13,084 --> 00:11:15,823
Sir, what d'you expect? We helped the guy
torture and deball an entire population.

111
00:11:15,838 --> 00:11:16,587
How many were there?

112
00:11:16,667 --> 00:11:18,257
At least fifty. We're not sure.

113
00:11:18,853 --> 00:11:19,577
Shaffer!

114
00:11:19,593 --> 00:11:20,834
You still haven't found Shaffer?

115
00:11:20,853 --> 00:11:23,049
No I was screaming his name
'cos I was fucking 'em.

116
00:11:26,567 --> 00:11:28,187
It's confirmed, sir, six escaped.

117
00:11:28,227 --> 00:11:29,367
I was told five.

118
00:11:29,427 --> 00:11:30,737
Now sir, apparently it's six.

119
00:11:30,957 --> 00:11:31,697
So what happened?

120
00:11:31,698 --> 00:11:33,767
Not clear. We know they
escaped the embassy.

121
00:11:33,907 --> 00:11:34,609
Where are they?

122
00:11:34,667 --> 00:11:36,186
The Canadian Ambassador's house.

123
00:11:36,187 --> 00:11:37,950
Do they stay put?
Are we attempting a rescue?

124
00:11:37,977 --> 00:11:39,464
I put through the Secretary of State.

125
00:11:39,745 --> 00:11:40,545
Yes.

126
00:11:40,835 --> 00:11:41,999
Is White House joining?

127
00:11:42,015 --> 00:11:44,089
They're claiming the Embassy
was a den of espionage.

128
00:11:44,094 --> 00:11:45,776
We wish it was a fucking den of espionage.

129
00:11:45,794 --> 00:11:48,562
CIA's got three people over there,
they don't see a revolution coming?

130
00:11:48,573 --> 00:11:50,260
Call it something other then intelligence.

131
00:11:50,301 --> 00:11:51,973
Hold for the Chief of Staff.
Harding?

132
00:11:52,047 --> 00:11:52,838
I'll call him back.

133
00:11:53,092 --> 00:11:55,657
They're sticking to it, no release
till we expel the Shah.

134
00:11:55,671 --> 00:11:57,105
Well, put him on a plane then, fuck him!

135
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,502
He's half dead and he's in chemo.

136
00:11:58,716 --> 00:12:00,399
Well, we took him in, he's ours now.

137
00:12:00,479 --> 00:12:02,849
Great, so we'll take any prick
as long as he's got cancer?

138
00:12:02,997 --> 00:12:04,377
Just the pricks on our side.

139
00:12:04,837 --> 00:12:06,665
So all of our other pricks
on their prick thrones

140
00:12:06,666 --> 00:12:08,104
will know that when they
get thrown out on a rail,

141
00:12:08,112 --> 00:12:09,701
they won't get their
fucking spleens taken out

142
00:12:09,709 --> 00:12:11,537
by some camel vet in Sinai.

143
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:13,634
What about the six who are
with the Canadians?

144
00:12:15,317 --> 00:12:17,645
We've got sixty in the Embassy
with guns to their heads right now.

145
00:12:17,646 --> 00:12:18,915
The whole world is
watching the Embassy.

146
00:12:18,916 --> 00:12:20,398
That makes them safer
than the six on the street.

147
00:12:20,408 --> 00:12:22,739
Bonnie Sauder's saying
it will be over in twenty-four hours.

148
00:12:26,447 --> 00:12:27,687
We leave the six where they are.

149
00:12:28,187 --> 00:12:29,687
I'll go brief the President.

150
00:12:32,161 --> 00:12:33,981
Right, I'll through it.

151
00:13:02,347 --> 00:13:06,075
<i>Iran's Revolutionary Guard, has
rounded up a gang of terrorist blamed</i>

152
00:13:06,082 --> 00:13:09,902
<i>for one murder of a half-dozen
followers of Ayatollah Khomeini.</i>

153
00:13:10,427 --> 00:13:14,146
<i>It says security at Khomeini's home
now has been raised.</i>

154
00:13:14,147 --> 00:13:19,076
<i>This by the way, is the 69th day that the
American hostages have been held in Tehran,</i>

155
00:13:19,077 --> 00:13:22,747
<i>there is no change reported
in the hostage situation.</i>

156
00:13:22,947 --> 00:13:26,651
<i>In this country, George Mitty died last
night, he was eighty five years old.</i>

157
00:13:28,377 --> 00:13:29,377
Yeah.

158
00:13:31,037 --> 00:13:31,837
Yes.

159
00:13:35,052 --> 00:13:35,787
What?

160
00:13:36,027 --> 00:13:38,527
<i>To begin with, of course,
we wanted to learn</i>

161
00:13:38,627 --> 00:13:41,986
<i>about the hostages held in
the American Embassy compound.</i>

162
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:45,627
<i>They may not understand what their
ordeal means to their countrymen.</i>

163
00:13:45,727 --> 00:13:48,157
<i>That this nation,
their nation, is outraged.</i>

164
00:13:48,216 --> 00:13:50,713
<i>And we cannot really
know what it is like</i>

165
00:13:50,727 --> 00:13:53,427
<i>inside the prison
that was once our embassy.</i>

166
00:13:53,857 --> 00:13:58,299
<i>Actions of Iran have shocked
the civilized world.</i>

167
00:13:58,657 --> 00:14:04,147
<i>Our embassy has been seized, and
more than sixty American citizens</i>

168
00:14:04,184 --> 00:14:06,057
<i>continue to be held as hostages,-</i>

169
00:14:06,058 --> 00:14:10,257
<i>As the situation in Iran this morning
is unchanged for the hostages,-</i>

170
00:14:10,557 --> 00:14:13,727
<i>the NBC situation in Iran
has changed however-</i>

171
00:14:24,994 --> 00:14:25,841
What happened?

172
00:14:26,897 --> 00:14:29,207
Six of them went out a back exit.

173
00:14:29,607 --> 00:14:31,066
Brits turned them away,

174
00:14:31,067 --> 00:14:33,807
Kiwis turned them away,
Canadians took 'em in.

175
00:14:34,007 --> 00:14:36,127
Traffic calls them 'House Guests'.

176
00:14:36,179 --> 00:14:39,576
They haven't left the Canadian
Ambassador's house since it happened.

177
00:14:39,577 --> 00:14:41,095
Why didn't we get them ten weeks ago?

178
00:14:41,096 --> 00:14:41,927
Too dangerous.

179
00:14:41,959 --> 00:14:45,497
We got revolutionary guards going
door to door, like Jehovah's Witnesses.

180
00:14:45,637 --> 00:14:49,206
Half of them think that Khomeini's been
too lenient on the ones in the Embassy.

181
00:14:49,207 --> 00:14:50,316
What about the White House?

182
00:14:50,407 --> 00:14:52,977
Carter's shitting enough bricks
to build the pyramids.

183
00:14:53,327 --> 00:14:54,976
The Canadians are done,

184
00:14:54,977 --> 00:14:56,465
they say they're baring too much risk.

185
00:14:56,466 --> 00:14:58,527
Their Foreign Secretary
corners Vance in Brussels,

186
00:14:58,528 --> 00:15:01,326
and told him she wants
the six of them out.

187
00:15:01,327 --> 00:15:02,347
Who else knows?

188
00:15:02,377 --> 00:15:03,746
Just the families.

189
00:15:03,747 --> 00:15:05,896
Meanwhile, some genius in our Embassy

190
00:15:05,897 --> 00:15:08,297
was keeping a mug book on
everybody who worked there.

191
00:15:08,437 --> 00:15:09,837
Jesus Christ!

192
00:15:09,855 --> 00:15:12,176
We think it got shredded
before they got in.

193
00:15:12,177 --> 00:15:14,296
But now the bastards are using

194
00:15:14,297 --> 00:15:16,776
sweatshop kids
to reassemble the shreds.

195
00:15:16,777 --> 00:15:20,236
Once they reassemble that book,
they'll know six Americans got out

196
00:15:20,237 --> 00:15:21,837
and they'll know what they look like.

197
00:15:21,838 --> 00:15:24,376
Standing room only for
beheadings in the square.

198
00:15:24,377 --> 00:15:25,497
Who's handling?

199
00:15:26,377 --> 00:15:28,377
State is coordinating in-house.

200
00:15:29,267 --> 00:15:30,127
State?

201
00:15:31,067 --> 00:15:32,127
They don't do exfil's.

202
00:15:32,128 --> 00:15:33,206
They do now.

203
00:15:33,207 --> 00:15:35,947
They wanna run it by us,
strictly as consultants.

204
00:15:36,037 --> 00:15:38,007
Engell says, it's a lose-lose.

205
00:15:38,147 --> 00:15:39,437
These people die,

206
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:41,437
they die badly, publicly.

207
00:15:41,867 --> 00:15:43,147
State wants the blame,

208
00:15:43,237 --> 00:15:44,177
we'll give it to 'em.

209
00:15:45,007 --> 00:15:46,407
What does he want me here for?

210
00:15:46,577 --> 00:15:49,837
So he can tell State
he ran it by his best exfil guy.

211
00:15:56,177 --> 00:15:57,377
Okay.

212
00:15:57,837 --> 00:16:00,666
This is Bob Pender from State OS,

213
00:16:00,667 --> 00:16:02,667
he's been talking
to Morgan, an ex-staff.

214
00:16:03,897 --> 00:16:04,667
Thank you.

215
00:16:05,637 --> 00:16:06,437
Alright.

216
00:16:07,237 --> 00:16:10,347
Mark and Cora Lijek,
twenty-nine and twenty-five,

217
00:16:10,348 --> 00:16:13,637
he's a Consular Officer, she's
an assistant, newly weds,

218
00:16:13,927 --> 00:16:16,527
They uh… only just got
there a couple months ago,

219
00:16:16,867 --> 00:16:20,496
No language skills
or in-country knowledge.

220
00:16:20,497 --> 00:16:21,896
Henry Lee Schatz,

221
00:16:21,947 --> 00:16:24,236
Agricultural attaché from Idaho,

222
00:16:24,237 --> 00:16:26,237
a bit of an oddball apparently,

223
00:16:26,327 --> 00:16:29,837
he was there to sell U.S.
tractors to Iranian agro.

224
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:32,037
Joe Stafford, late twenties

225
00:16:32,267 --> 00:16:33,147
he's smart

226
00:16:33,297 --> 00:16:35,237
and a climber, speaks Farsi,

227
00:16:35,637 --> 00:16:37,637
he arranged the hire of his wife,

228
00:16:37,867 --> 00:16:38,696
Kathy.

229
00:16:38,697 --> 00:16:40,037
The Embassy was understaffed,

230
00:16:40,038 --> 00:16:42,037
so the faculty wives
were the typing pool.

231
00:16:42,038 --> 00:16:43,347
And Bob Anders,

232
00:16:43,407 --> 00:16:45,726
senior consular officer,
oldest of the group,

233
00:16:45,727 --> 00:16:47,497
and most likely to be group leader.

234
00:16:47,498 --> 00:16:50,127
They've been hiding at the
Canadian Ambassador's residence.

235
00:16:50,667 --> 00:16:54,546
Fortunately, we do not believe the
Iranians are aware the six have escaped.

236
00:16:54,547 --> 00:16:55,347
So…

237
00:16:56,212 --> 00:16:59,037
What we'd like for this are bicycles.

238
00:16:59,547 --> 00:17:02,527
We've identified back roads
from the Chamran district,

239
00:17:02,528 --> 00:17:04,866
couple of rat lines
through the mountains

240
00:17:04,867 --> 00:17:06,436
to the crossing near Tabriz.

241
00:17:06,437 --> 00:17:08,526
Cars are off the table,

242
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:10,005
because of the road blocks.

243
00:17:10,006 --> 00:17:11,465
We wait until the weather clears up,

244
00:17:11,466 --> 00:17:12,837
then deliver the six bikes,

245
00:17:12,838 --> 00:17:14,837
provide them with maps
to the Turkish border.

246
00:17:14,838 --> 00:17:17,346
We have intelligence,
they can ride bicycles

247
00:17:17,347 --> 00:17:20,233
or we're prepared to send in
somebody to teach 'em.

248
00:17:28,127 --> 00:17:31,927
Or you could just send in training wheels
and meet them at the border with Gatorade.

249
00:17:32,037 --> 00:17:32,837
Tony…

250
00:17:33,327 --> 00:17:35,407
It's three hundred miles
to the Turkish border.

251
00:17:35,577 --> 00:17:38,206
They'd need a support team
following them with a tire pump.

252
00:17:38,207 --> 00:17:41,982
We were just asked to sharp shoot this,
State is handling the ops.

253
00:17:41,998 --> 00:17:43,777
I'm sorry, who is this?

254
00:17:43,897 --> 00:17:45,526
Tony is an exfil spesh,

255
00:17:45,527 --> 00:17:48,266
he's got a lot of Shah's
people out after the fall.

256
00:17:48,267 --> 00:17:50,837
Sir, if these people can read or add,

257
00:17:51,037 --> 00:17:53,697
pretty soon they're gonna figure out
they're six short of a full deck.

258
00:17:54,347 --> 00:17:56,805
It's winter. You can't afford
to wait around until spring,

259
00:17:56,806 --> 00:17:58,327
so it's nice enough
to take a bike ride.

260
00:17:58,437 --> 00:18:00,327
They only way out
of that city is the airport.

261
00:18:00,577 --> 00:18:02,125
You build new cover identities for 'em,

262
00:18:02,126 --> 00:18:04,297
you send in a Moses, he takes
them out on a commercial flight.

263
00:18:04,837 --> 00:18:06,182
We've explored those options.

264
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:09,060
You're never gonna get them through
airport control, Komiteh own the place.

265
00:18:09,084 --> 00:18:12,575
They could pose as reporters, if the
government issued seventy something…

266
00:18:12,576 --> 00:18:13,525
– Seventy four.
– Visas,

267
00:18:13,526 --> 00:18:15,347
– for American journalists…
– And the Revolutionary Guards

268
00:18:15,348 --> 00:18:16,926
keep them on seventy four leashes.

269
00:18:16,927 --> 00:18:18,927
If they're caught with
fake journalist creds,

270
00:18:19,043 --> 00:18:21,067
it's Peter and Jane's head
in a noose in an hour.

271
00:18:21,068 --> 00:18:23,866
Look, North America accents
gives us limited options,

272
00:18:23,867 --> 00:18:25,470
so we get the Canadians
to issue them passports.

273
00:18:25,471 --> 00:18:28,047
What about English teachers
at the international school?

274
00:18:28,063 --> 00:18:30,245
It's a good idea, but that school's
been closed for eight months.

275
00:18:30,246 --> 00:18:32,807
Okay, so how about
'the do-gooders'?

276
00:18:34,497 --> 00:18:35,979
Six Canadians have been over there

277
00:18:35,987 --> 00:18:38,377
inspecting crops, ensuring the kids
are getting enough to eat,

278
00:18:38,378 --> 00:18:41,147
we give them creds, makes
them look like ag' NGOs.

279
00:18:41,297 --> 00:18:43,147
It's a 'feed the kids' thing.

280
00:18:43,577 --> 00:18:44,035
Okay.

281
00:18:44,036 --> 00:18:45,267
Those kids are black.

282
00:18:46,127 --> 00:18:47,496
Those are African kids.

283
00:18:47,497 --> 00:18:49,576
We can get ethnically appropriate kids.

284
00:18:49,577 --> 00:18:51,296
Are there starving kids in Iran?

285
00:18:51,297 --> 00:18:53,837
I'm sure there's some
skinny kids in Iran.

286
00:18:54,073 --> 00:18:55,642
What about missionary?
– Or… seeds…

287
00:18:55,698 --> 00:18:57,197
called… "seeds of hope".

288
00:18:57,267 --> 00:19:00,122
Hold on… Sir, do you have
this newspaper in front of you?

289
00:19:00,138 --> 00:19:01,718
Would you mind taking a look at it?

290
00:19:03,407 --> 00:19:04,777
What's in this picture?

291
00:19:05,407 --> 00:19:06,095
Tehran.

292
00:19:06,096 --> 00:19:07,467
Right.
What's on the ground?

293
00:19:10,067 --> 00:19:11,697
– Snow.
– Right.

294
00:19:11,837 --> 00:19:15,437
So what crops are the 'do-gooders'
inspecting under frosting?

295
00:19:17,237 --> 00:19:17,927
Sir…

296
00:19:18,697 --> 00:19:20,377
Exfils are like abortions.

297
00:19:20,667 --> 00:19:22,007
You don't wanna need one.

298
00:19:22,347 --> 00:19:24,897
But when you do,
you don't do it yourself.

299
00:19:30,347 --> 00:19:31,807
You have a better plan?

300
00:19:33,037 --> 00:19:34,081
No Sir.

301
00:19:37,747 --> 00:19:40,276
<i>What ever the conflicting
signals from Iran today,</i>

302
00:19:40,284 --> 00:19:41,744
<i>for that matter everyday,</i>

303
00:19:41,752 --> 00:19:45,466
<i>about whether the hostages will
or will not be tried as spies,</i>

304
00:19:45,467 --> 00:19:49,377
<i>the government of the United States
has not deviated from its basic demands:</i>

305
00:19:49,547 --> 00:19:51,334
<i>the hostages must be freed.</i>

306
00:19:51,335 --> 00:19:52,577
.. to defend human rights,

307
00:19:52,578 --> 00:19:54,666
it not only does not defend them,

308
00:19:54,667 --> 00:19:57,406
it violates them for all nations.

309
00:19:57,407 --> 00:20:02,466
We demand extradition of a man
who for more than 37 years,

310
00:20:02,467 --> 00:20:05,757
with the United States support,
has killed months old babies

311
00:20:05,758 --> 00:20:07,496
in the arms of their mothers.

312
00:20:07,497 --> 00:20:11,696
<i>He said that if the Americans try
military force to rescue the hostages,</i>

313
00:20:11,697 --> 00:20:15,067
<i>the students will kill them all
and blow up the Embassy.</i>

314
00:20:16,267 --> 00:20:19,559
<i>Americans were outraged
at Iran and anyone Iranian.</i>

315
00:20:19,575 --> 00:20:22,497
<i>Before this decision was taken,
there was a demonstration in Houston.</i>

316
00:20:22,498 --> 00:20:25,924
<i>An Iranian flag was burned,
while Anti-Iranians demonstrators</i>

317
00:20:25,932 --> 00:20:28,525
<i>gathered near the Iranian
Consulate. The demonstrators-</i>

318
00:20:28,547 --> 00:20:32,021
<i>.. also it's what led to a decision
to scrutinize the bases of the Iranian-</i>

319
00:20:32,037 --> 00:20:35,145
They knew exactly what
was going on, they knew it.

320
00:20:35,146 --> 00:20:37,715
But I don't understand wha-
what they should do now,

321
00:20:37,731 --> 00:20:40,387
send them back, just to-
to be tortured and killed?

322
00:20:40,388 --> 00:20:42,191
I don't think that justice
is the worst thing.

323
00:20:42,192 --> 00:20:45,962
<i>When did people first tell you
that torture was going on in Iran?</i>

324
00:20:45,967 --> 00:20:47,512
<i>They would never come to me and say:</i>

325
00:20:47,528 --> 00:20:50,266
<i>"Well Sir, we have tortured this fellow".</i>

326
00:20:50,267 --> 00:20:53,637
<i>.. Sadat of Egypt he calls you Imam,</i>

327
00:20:53,772 --> 00:20:57,547
<i>forgive me, his words not mine: A lunatic.</i>

328
00:20:57,697 --> 00:21:00,409
Why didn't he have a choice,
why do you think he didn't have a choice?

329
00:21:00,417 --> 00:21:02,265
Because he would have been
referred to as a barbarian.

330
00:21:02,266 --> 00:21:03,287
– Please!
– That's why they're stating

331
00:21:03,295 --> 00:21:04,927
he liked the current regime!

332
00:21:05,189 --> 00:21:06,983
The Shah did more for women's right-

333
00:21:07,003 --> 00:21:08,173
I think we've better if…

334
00:21:08,407 --> 00:21:10,619
Please everyone, get into the coal.

335
00:21:27,607 --> 00:21:28,407
<i>.. Get out of here!</i>

336
00:21:28,414 --> 00:21:30,665
<i>At one point the mob
cornered one of Iranians.</i>

337
00:21:30,666 --> 00:21:33,927
<i>When he tried to protect
himself, this is what happened.</i>

338
00:21:35,067 --> 00:21:36,037
<i>Hit him again!</i>

339
00:21:36,467 --> 00:21:38,127
<i>Hit him until he can't take it anymore!</i>

340
00:21:38,128 --> 00:21:40,127
<i>We're sick of them!
– Yeah!</i>

341
00:21:40,897 --> 00:21:42,347
<i>America!</i>

342
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:44,449
<i>.. even in our little community here,</i>

343
00:21:44,497 --> 00:21:47,727
<i>I mean people are drawn
uptight, they're tense.</i>

344
00:21:48,407 --> 00:21:51,897
<i>They shouldn't even let those
students in that Embassy there.</i>

345
00:21:52,547 --> 00:21:54,947
<i>Just shoot a couple of 'em.
Show 'em we mean business.</i>

346
00:21:55,527 --> 00:21:59,175
<i>Men who served in Vietnam for what
they believed was right are angry.</i>

347
00:21:59,176 --> 00:22:00,237
<i>I'm mad as hell.</i>

348
00:22:00,267 --> 00:22:04,032
<i>I'm- I'm like the guy screaming on that
movie program in 'network' you know,</i>

349
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,482
<i>I've had it! And if huh…</i>

350
00:22:06,697 --> 00:22:08,807
<i>if need be I'll bear arms again!</i>

351
00:22:09,147 --> 00:22:12,777
<i>That's the way it is,
Wednesday, January 16th, 1980.</i>

352
00:22:13,097 --> 00:22:17,127
<i>74th day of captivity
for 50 Americans in Iran.</i>

353
00:22:25,727 --> 00:22:26,526
Hello?

354
00:22:26,527 --> 00:22:27,467
My man!

355
00:22:27,747 --> 00:22:28,837
I'll get mom.

356
00:22:29,551 --> 00:22:30,620
I'm calling for you.

357
00:22:32,897 --> 00:22:34,437
Did you do your homework tonight?

358
00:22:34,607 --> 00:22:35,577
Yeah it was easy.

359
00:22:36,067 --> 00:22:37,576
Excellent.
What are we watching?

360
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,000
Battle for the Planet of the Apes.

361
00:22:39,807 --> 00:22:41,207
Tell me, what channel is it on?

362
00:22:41,527 --> 00:22:42,347
Five.

363
00:22:46,947 --> 00:22:47,727
Alright.

364
00:22:49,637 --> 00:22:51,098
What did you do at school today?

365
00:22:51,237 --> 00:22:52,837
Nothing, I don't know.
Nothing.

366
00:22:54,947 --> 00:22:57,637
It can't be nothing.
Something must've happened.

367
00:22:57,707 --> 00:22:59,411
After school I've traded baseball cards,-

368
00:22:59,459 --> 00:23:00,665
Hmm-Hmm…

369
00:23:18,765 --> 00:23:21,291
Ok you know those science
fiction, Star Trek, Star Wars,

370
00:23:21,299 --> 00:23:23,147
they need an exotic location to shoot,

371
00:23:23,148 --> 00:23:25,147
Moonscape, Mars, desert, you know…

372
00:23:25,697 --> 00:23:26,877
Now image this.

373
00:23:28,207 --> 00:23:32,327
They're a Canadian film crew on a location
scout for a science fiction movie.

374
00:23:32,897 --> 00:23:34,067
We put it out there,

375
00:23:34,237 --> 00:23:36,067
the Canadian producers
put it out there.

376
00:23:36,177 --> 00:23:38,607
They were looking at Egypt, Istanbul.

377
00:23:39,347 --> 00:23:43,297
Then we go to the Consulate and say:
'Hey, we want to look in Iran too'.

378
00:23:43,697 --> 00:23:47,007
I fly into Tehran, we all fly
out together as a film crew.

379
00:23:47,547 --> 00:23:48,127
Done.

380
00:23:48,128 --> 00:23:50,475
Flamboyant cover identity
should be avoided

381
00:23:50,483 --> 00:23:52,181
as it increases operational visibility.

382
00:23:52,189 --> 00:23:53,583
This is a lot more
plausible than foreigners

383
00:23:53,591 --> 00:23:55,125
who wanna become teachers in Iran.

384
00:23:55,126 --> 00:23:57,835
You want to blend in with the population
you don't look like a rodeo clown.

385
00:23:57,836 --> 00:24:00,665
Just gonna wake up tomorrow morning
and be in the movie business?

386
00:24:00,666 --> 00:24:02,497
We already have credentials
for the teachers.

387
00:24:02,577 --> 00:24:03,975
No Sir, we have a contact in-

388
00:24:03,976 --> 00:24:05,375
– Chambers.
– John Chambers,

389
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:07,802
he's a Hollywood prosthetics guy, he's got
an Oscar, he did Planet of the Apes

390
00:24:07,810 --> 00:24:10,067
he's done a bunch of contract
work for us in the past.

391
00:24:10,947 --> 00:24:12,807
I go see him, he sets this up.

392
00:24:12,808 --> 00:24:14,897
One, two days, make it look real.

393
00:24:29,977 --> 00:24:31,407
I went outside for thirty seconds.

394
00:24:31,667 --> 00:24:32,145
Alright?

395
00:24:32,146 --> 00:24:34,037
Could you give me a break?
I can't breath in this house.

396
00:24:34,038 --> 00:24:36,096
I need some fresh air,
I can't- I can't breath!

397
00:24:36,097 --> 00:24:37,345
Stay inside the fucking house!

398
00:24:37,346 --> 00:24:38,478
Who saw me go outside, I'm just curious?

399
00:24:38,486 --> 00:24:39,851
– That's not the point.
– That's not the point Bob.

400
00:24:39,867 --> 00:24:41,349
Doesn't matter if I saw you
go out or you see me.

401
00:24:41,357 --> 00:24:43,174
– Did you see me go out?
– No! You did go outside…

402
00:24:43,182 --> 00:24:45,022
I did. Okay, I saw you.

403
00:24:45,030 --> 00:24:48,267
Bob, it only takes one
second for them to spot you.

404
00:24:53,267 --> 00:24:55,347
Some Americans are missing.

405
00:24:55,747 --> 00:24:57,744
Look at the repaired list
of embassy employees.

406
00:24:58,577 --> 00:25:00,097
The numbers don't match.

407
00:25:00,407 --> 00:25:03,777
Finish assembling the
pictures from the Embassy.

408
00:25:03,897 --> 00:25:06,407
All I need is their faces
and I will find them.

409
00:25:06,467 --> 00:25:08,267
Yes Sir, it'll be done.

410
00:25:20,527 --> 00:25:22,147
We want you to go to LA.

411
00:25:22,297 --> 00:25:25,327
If you can make the movie thing
credible, we'll take it to the director.

412
00:25:26,527 --> 00:25:27,327
Don't fuck up.

413
00:25:28,127 --> 00:25:29,807
The whole country is watching you.

414
00:25:30,697 --> 00:25:32,037
They just don't know it.

415
00:25:39,607 --> 00:25:41,327
My creation…

416
00:25:42,377 --> 00:25:43,837
My creation!

417
00:25:50,347 --> 00:25:51,407
What the fuck, Bryan?

418
00:25:51,408 --> 00:25:53,037
– Cut!
– We are cutting!

419
00:25:56,497 --> 00:25:57,667
Chambers!

420
00:25:57,727 --> 00:25:59,667
John Chambers make up!

421
00:26:11,347 --> 00:26:15,037
He says the minotaur prosthetic
is too tight so he can't act.

422
00:26:15,697 --> 00:26:18,147
If he could act, he wouldn't
be playing a minotaur.

423
00:26:24,347 --> 00:26:25,467
Mr. Chambers…

424
00:26:26,437 --> 00:26:27,467
Kevin Arkins.

425
00:26:29,807 --> 00:26:30,837
Hey Tony.

426
00:26:56,947 --> 00:26:58,347
What are you shooting?

427
00:26:58,837 --> 00:27:00,347
Monster movie.

428
00:27:01,527 --> 00:27:03,727
Yeah? Any good?

429
00:27:04,407 --> 00:27:06,067
Target audience will hate it.

430
00:27:06,267 --> 00:27:08,067
Who's the target audience?

431
00:27:08,147 --> 00:27:09,127
People with eyes.

432
00:27:12,327 --> 00:27:13,297
Talk to me.

433
00:27:15,497 --> 00:27:16,607
It's an exfil.

434
00:27:17,007 --> 00:27:17,867
From where?

435
00:27:19,267 --> 00:27:20,927
Worst place you can think of.

436
00:27:21,127 --> 00:27:22,927
Universal Studio.

437
00:27:29,037 --> 00:27:30,807
How are you gonna get in the Embassy?

438
00:27:30,947 --> 00:27:32,067
They're not in the Embassy.

439
00:27:32,267 --> 00:27:34,377
During the takeover six people escaped.

440
00:27:34,547 --> 00:27:36,377
They're hiding out in Tehran…

441
00:27:37,076 --> 00:27:38,367
and that's who I'm gonna go get.

442
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:39,670
What am I making?

443
00:27:40,837 --> 00:27:42,787
I need you to help me
make a fake movie.

444
00:27:42,827 --> 00:27:45,147
Well, you're in the right place.

445
00:27:45,747 --> 00:27:48,896
I wanna setup a production company
and build a cover around making a movie.

446
00:27:48,897 --> 00:27:50,897
– That we're not gonna make.
– No.

447
00:27:51,497 --> 00:27:53,913
So you wanna come to
Hollywood and act like a big shot,

448
00:27:53,914 --> 00:27:54,423
Yeah.

449
00:27:54,431 --> 00:27:56,050
– without actually doing anything.
– No.

450
00:27:56,067 --> 00:27:57,377
You'll fit right in.

451
00:28:03,577 --> 00:28:04,837
Let's see.

452
00:28:05,895 --> 00:28:09,206
Well this one has got an M.A. in English,
she should be your screenwriter.

453
00:28:09,207 --> 00:28:12,377
Sometimes they go along on scouts
because they want their free meals.

454
00:28:12,437 --> 00:28:13,897
Here's your director.

455
00:28:14,347 --> 00:28:16,467
Can you teach somebody
to be a director in a day?

456
00:28:16,468 --> 00:28:19,177
You teach a recess monkey
to be a director in a day.

457
00:28:19,667 --> 00:28:22,667
Look if you're gonna do this,
you gotta do it.

458
00:28:22,867 --> 00:28:25,297
The Kominiacs are fruit loops,
but they got cousins

459
00:28:25,309 --> 00:28:28,037
who sell prayer rugs
and A-tracks on Le Brea.

460
00:28:28,637 --> 00:28:32,067
You can't build cover stories
around a movie that doesn't exist.

461
00:28:32,237 --> 00:28:34,407
You need a script, you need a producer.

462
00:28:34,497 --> 00:28:35,437
Make me a producer.

463
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:38,377
No. You're… an
associate producer at best.

464
00:28:39,927 --> 00:28:42,927
You're gonna do a 20 million
dollars Star Wars rip-off.

465
00:28:43,177 --> 00:28:46,637
You need somebody who's a somebody,
to put their name on it.

466
00:28:46,977 --> 00:28:48,637
Somebody respectable…

467
00:28:50,147 --> 00:28:51,067
with credits…

468
00:28:52,407 --> 00:28:54,867
who you can trust
with classified information…

469
00:28:55,977 --> 00:28:58,037
who'd produce a fake movie…

470
00:28:58,867 --> 00:29:00,037
for free.

471
00:29:13,667 --> 00:29:15,407
Hi, I only got a couple of minutes.

472
00:29:15,437 --> 00:29:17,177
I'm getting a lifetime
achievement award.

473
00:29:17,267 --> 00:29:18,497
Mazel tov, Lester.

474
00:29:18,897 --> 00:29:22,267
I'd rather stay home and count
the wrinkles on my dog's balls.

475
00:29:22,837 --> 00:29:23,807
Okay.

476
00:29:23,947 --> 00:29:26,984
You got six people hiding out
in a town of what… 4 million people,

477
00:29:26,992 --> 00:29:30,837
all of whom chant death to
America' all the live long day.

478
00:29:30,977 --> 00:29:32,807
You want to set up a movie in a week,

479
00:29:32,867 --> 00:29:36,327
you want to lie to Hollywood,
a town where everybody lies for a living,

480
00:29:36,437 --> 00:29:39,037
then you're gonna sneak 007 over here,

481
00:29:39,127 --> 00:29:42,577
into a country that wants CIA
blood on their breakfast cereal,

482
00:29:42,599 --> 00:29:46,237
and you're gonna walk the Brady Bunch
out of the most watched city in the world.

483
00:29:46,437 --> 00:29:49,237
That's about a hundred militia
at the airport. That's right.

484
00:29:50,637 --> 00:29:51,697
Right.

485
00:29:53,697 --> 00:29:55,437
Look I… I got to tell ya,

486
00:29:55,577 --> 00:29:59,327
we- we did suicide missions in the
Army that had better odds than this.

487
00:29:59,407 --> 00:30:00,837
Sir, the car is here.

488
00:30:08,837 --> 00:30:11,407
You ever think, Lester,
this is all for the cameras?

489
00:30:12,147 --> 00:30:14,937
Well, they're getting the ratings,
I'll say that for them.

490
00:30:27,037 --> 00:30:28,765
We're going to need a script.

491
00:30:58,927 --> 00:30:59,867
I love you.

492
00:31:09,837 --> 00:31:12,007
Sahar, how are you doing?

493
00:31:12,727 --> 00:31:14,207
Fine, thank you.

494
00:31:15,727 --> 00:31:17,915
Your friends from Canada, ma'am,

495
00:31:18,034 --> 00:31:19,947
all this time, they never go out.

496
00:31:35,147 --> 00:31:36,621
Sahar knows.

497
00:31:40,527 --> 00:31:42,497
How about 'The Horses of Achilles'?

498
00:31:42,577 --> 00:31:45,437
Νо gооd. Νоbоdy dоеѕ wеѕtеrnѕ аnymоrе.

499
00:31:45,527 --> 00:31:46,727
It's ancient Troy.

500
00:31:46,973 --> 00:31:48,947
If it's got horses in it,
it's a western.

501
00:31:49,927 --> 00:31:51,237
Hey, Kenny please?

502
00:31:51,377 --> 00:31:53,497
Yeah it's John Chambers,
about the office space.

503
00:31:53,547 --> 00:31:54,637
It doesn't matter.

504
00:31:54,977 --> 00:31:56,067
It's a fake movie.

505
00:31:56,177 --> 00:31:59,067
If I'm doing a fake movie,
it's going to be a fake hit.

506
00:31:59,897 --> 00:32:03,607
Cardinal wants all cover options
on his desk Friday morning.

507
00:32:03,667 --> 00:32:07,177
Engell's prepping the bikes option,
teachers option,

508
00:32:07,207 --> 00:32:09,607
you have 72 hours to make yours better.

509
00:32:10,927 --> 00:32:11,758
Fine.

510
00:32:36,637 --> 00:32:40,127
Hey is 8006 still on the open list?

511
00:32:41,467 --> 00:32:42,467
Yeah I'll hold.

512
00:32:42,697 --> 00:32:44,577
Fade in on a starship landing.

513
00:32:44,697 --> 00:32:46,777
An exotic Middle Eastern vibe.

514
00:32:46,927 --> 00:32:50,867
Women gather offering ecstatic
libations to the sky gods.

515
00:32:51,297 --> 00:32:52,097
Argo.

516
00:32:52,327 --> 00:32:53,897
"A Science-Fantasy Adventure."

517
00:32:54,547 --> 00:32:56,394
It's a turnaround, it's dog shit.

518
00:32:56,402 --> 00:32:58,767
It's a space movie in the Middle East.
Does it matter if-

519
00:32:58,777 --> 00:32:59,867
Could we get the option?

520
00:33:00,547 --> 00:33:01,837
Why do we need the option?

521
00:33:02,267 --> 00:33:03,837
You're worried about the Ayatollah?

522
00:33:03,947 --> 00:33:05,837
Try the WGA.

523
00:33:08,147 --> 00:33:09,327
Just let me do the talking.

524
00:33:09,497 --> 00:33:13,050
I've known this guy for 25 years,
he's full of shit, and he comes on hard,

525
00:33:13,066 --> 00:33:14,977
but uh… I can handle it.

526
00:33:16,777 --> 00:33:19,327
You want to go into production
with this in one month?

527
00:33:19,437 --> 00:33:21,067
Up like a carny ride.

528
00:33:21,127 --> 00:33:22,147
One month, yeah.

529
00:33:22,327 --> 00:33:24,807
– Who are you again?
– Kevin Arkins, Studio 6 Films.

530
00:33:24,947 --> 00:33:25,747
He's the money.

531
00:33:26,497 --> 00:33:28,377
Look, what d'you say uh…

532
00:33:28,437 --> 00:33:31,897
fifteen thou'and, let's close on this?

533
00:33:33,527 --> 00:33:35,237
You want me to be honest with you, Les?

534
00:33:35,327 --> 00:33:37,607
No. I would like you to bullshit me, Max.

535
00:33:38,177 --> 00:33:38,727
Alright.

536
00:33:40,007 --> 00:33:42,127
I enjoyed your films, the early ones.

537
00:33:42,697 --> 00:33:46,867
I took this meeting out of respect,
because I wanted to say no to your face.

538
00:33:48,067 --> 00:33:49,947
Thank you. Very respectful.

539
00:33:50,007 --> 00:33:51,577
You're finished, Lester.

540
00:33:51,927 --> 00:33:54,547
Get your cataracts fixed,
read the trades.

541
00:33:55,127 --> 00:33:57,667
MGM just capitalized for six new films.

542
00:33:57,807 --> 00:33:59,807
They're screaming for Sci-Fi.

543
00:34:00,497 --> 00:34:03,147
They're offering me four times
what you guys are offering me.

544
00:34:05,207 --> 00:34:07,637
Well… what can I say?

545
00:34:08,497 --> 00:34:09,897
Congratulations.

546
00:34:10,947 --> 00:34:12,267
But see,

547
00:34:12,607 --> 00:34:15,437
it kind of worries me what you
said, let me tell you why.

548
00:34:16,267 --> 00:34:20,127
Couple of weeks ago I was sitting
at Trader Vic's, I was enjoying a Mai Tai,

549
00:34:20,237 --> 00:34:21,947
when my pal, Warren Beatty comes in,

550
00:34:22,067 --> 00:34:24,297
he wishes me well,
we have a little chat.

551
00:34:24,747 --> 00:34:27,547
Seems he was attached
to star in 'Zulu Empire',

552
00:34:27,727 --> 00:34:29,927
which was just gonna anchor
that MGM slate.

553
00:34:30,267 --> 00:34:33,297
But Warren confided in me that
the picture's gone over budget

554
00:34:33,337 --> 00:34:36,377
because the Zulu extras
want to unionize.

555
00:34:36,527 --> 00:34:40,577
They may be cannibals, but they want
health and dental so the movie's kaput!

556
00:34:40,747 --> 00:34:44,127
Which means that the MGM
deal ain't gonna happen,

557
00:34:44,149 --> 00:34:47,327
and your script ain't worth
a buffalo shit on a nickel!

558
00:34:47,727 --> 00:34:51,407
So, the way it looks to me through
the cataracts I grant you,

559
00:34:51,497 --> 00:34:53,407
is that you can either sign here,

560
00:34:53,437 --> 00:34:56,527
and take 10,000 dollars
for your toilet-paper script,

561
00:34:56,637 --> 00:34:58,527
or you can go fuck yourself!

562
00:34:59,807 --> 00:35:01,297
With all due respect.

563
00:35:08,127 --> 00:35:09,467
You really know Warren Beatty?

564
00:35:09,727 --> 00:35:10,665
Yes I do.

565
00:35:10,666 --> 00:35:13,067
I took a leak next to him
once at the Golder Globes.

566
00:35:14,267 --> 00:35:15,067
Taco?

567
00:35:33,807 --> 00:35:35,177
Got any kids, Lester?

568
00:35:36,377 --> 00:35:38,237
Yeah, I have two daughters.

569
00:35:39,747 --> 00:35:40,807
See 'em much?

570
00:35:41,527 --> 00:35:43,377
I talk to 'em once a year…

571
00:35:44,067 --> 00:35:44,890
maybe.

572
00:35:44,927 --> 00:35:45,777
Why is that?

573
00:35:49,607 --> 00:35:51,267
I was a terrible father.

574
00:35:53,497 --> 00:35:55,007
The bullshit business…

575
00:35:55,807 --> 00:35:58,439
it's like coal mining, you- you
come home to your wife and kids,

576
00:35:58,447 --> 00:36:00,497
you can't… you can't wash it off.

577
00:36:02,327 --> 00:36:03,037
You?

578
00:36:04,759 --> 00:36:05,879
Yeah I got a son.

579
00:36:07,497 --> 00:36:09,347
He lives in Virgina with his mother.

580
00:36:13,437 --> 00:36:14,497
You're divorced?

581
00:36:15,527 --> 00:36:16,747
Taking time off.

582
00:36:19,327 --> 00:36:20,607
He needs to be, you know…

583
00:36:21,697 --> 00:36:22,747
where he is.

584
00:36:25,097 --> 00:36:26,577
Kids need the mother.

585
00:36:35,727 --> 00:36:40,037
They caught the Shah's chief of security
trying to get on a plane to Paris.

586
00:36:41,497 --> 00:36:42,267
Listen,

587
00:36:42,467 --> 00:36:46,327
"since the incident, the number
of guards at the airport has doubled,

588
00:36:46,437 --> 00:36:49,836
a thorough background examination
should be expected".

589
00:36:49,837 --> 00:36:51,438
The movie cover isn't strong enough yet,

590
00:36:51,439 --> 00:36:52,947
I need another week, Jack.

591
00:36:53,147 --> 00:36:54,177
You don't have it.

592
00:36:57,347 --> 00:36:58,637
We got an office,

593
00:36:58,897 --> 00:37:00,327
we got business cards,

594
00:37:01,297 --> 00:37:02,727
we got a poster.

595
00:37:04,037 --> 00:37:07,037
If I'm the Revolutionary Guard, there's
nothing we couldn't have made at home.

596
00:37:07,497 --> 00:37:09,637
Six people's lives depend on this.

597
00:37:11,177 --> 00:37:11,977
It's not enough.

598
00:37:12,127 --> 00:37:15,007
If we're gonna fool these people,
it has to be big,

599
00:37:15,147 --> 00:37:17,667
and it has to have something
that says it's authentic.

600
00:37:19,127 --> 00:37:21,727
I did a movie with Rock Hudson one time.

601
00:37:23,147 --> 00:37:25,437
If you want to sell a lie…

602
00:37:26,577 --> 00:37:29,067
get the press to sell it for you.

603
00:37:29,977 --> 00:37:33,637
No no no, press event, then they're-
they're gonna read through the script.

604
00:37:33,927 --> 00:37:37,777
I got a bunch of actors who are gonna read
from beginning to end, all the way through.

605
00:37:37,947 --> 00:37:39,927
They have costumes and everything.

606
00:37:40,097 --> 00:37:43,867
No, no, no, I can't, I got, uh,
Variety has the exclusive on that.

607
00:37:43,947 --> 00:37:47,207
Any way to make this more uh…
Middle Eastern?

608
00:37:47,727 --> 00:37:49,547
Mesopotamia?
Egypt?

609
00:37:49,927 --> 00:37:50,747
Iran.

610
00:37:50,777 --> 00:37:54,467
Look, I can get you in, but you
gotta promise me at least half a page.

611
00:37:54,637 --> 00:37:57,867
No, no, this thing's an event,
it's going to be a spectacle.

612
00:38:59,667 --> 00:39:00,437
Lester.

613
00:39:00,547 --> 00:39:03,527
Nina, you look fabulous!

614
00:39:03,667 --> 00:39:04,747
You doing the reading?

615
00:39:04,837 --> 00:39:07,066
I'm playing Serksi, the Galactic Witch.

616
00:39:07,067 --> 00:39:08,497
Great, I'll call ya.

617
00:39:10,607 --> 00:39:13,267
Keep that fucking space
witch away from me.

618
00:39:13,497 --> 00:39:14,347
You know her?

619
00:39:14,667 --> 00:39:15,777
I was married to her.

620
00:39:15,897 --> 00:39:17,777
Oh my God, Iraq is amazing!

621
00:39:17,837 --> 00:39:18,837
Well, we're shooting in Iran.

622
00:39:18,947 --> 00:39:20,467
Iran with an N?

623
00:39:20,607 --> 00:39:22,127
Yeah.
We're very excited.

624
00:39:22,207 --> 00:39:23,607
You ever watch the news?

625
00:39:23,697 --> 00:39:25,607
What does the title refer to?

626
00:39:26,207 --> 00:39:27,607
The Argo!

627
00:39:27,747 --> 00:39:28,607
The thing…

628
00:39:29,007 --> 00:39:30,777
Like Jason and the
Golden Fleece, or what?

629
00:39:30,778 --> 00:39:33,609
No, no, it's the ship, it's the-
the spaceship, it goes…

630
00:39:33,712 --> 00:39:36,377
it goes everywhere, it goes all…

631
00:39:36,777 --> 00:39:38,377
…all throughout space.

632
00:39:38,527 --> 00:39:39,727
So it's the Argonaut?

633
00:39:40,467 --> 00:39:41,097
No.

634
00:39:41,297 --> 00:39:42,577
What- what does Argo mean?

635
00:39:42,667 --> 00:39:43,667
I don't know.

636
00:39:43,747 --> 00:39:44,727
You don't know?

637
00:39:44,947 --> 00:39:47,437
It means "Argo, fuck yourself"!

638
00:39:48,862 --> 00:39:51,577
Will you pay me every attention,
ladies and gentlemen?

639
00:39:51,813 --> 00:39:56,122
If our artists could settle in,
we'll just be ready to begin the reading.

640
00:39:57,220 --> 00:40:00,797
Argo. From Mary Ann Boyd.

641
00:40:01,368 --> 00:40:04,470
Begin on starship…

642
00:40:15,488 --> 00:40:18,677
<i>The people working here are not diplomats.</i>

643
00:40:18,767 --> 00:40:21,504
<i>In fact, as the Iman Khomeini said,</i>

644
00:40:21,598 --> 00:40:25,551
<i>they have found no evidence that proves
that these people are diplomats.</i>

645
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:30,082
<i>All evidence proves that
these people are spies.</i>

646
00:40:30,427 --> 00:40:33,882
<i>In the name of God,
the beneficent, the merciful,</i>

647
00:40:33,936 --> 00:40:36,692
<i>our message to the waking
peoples of the world,</i>

648
00:40:36,953 --> 00:40:39,792
<i>at this time we want to expose
the hateful acts of United States…</i>

649
00:40:39,816 --> 00:40:41,636
Our world has changed,

650
00:40:42,607 --> 00:40:45,783
Fires of hope stopped burning
in this galaxy long ago.

651
00:40:45,832 --> 00:40:47,565
The ship is turning around.

652
00:40:47,602 --> 00:40:49,335
Fire the thrusters!

653
00:40:49,507 --> 00:40:52,433
He says a gravitational field
that strong will kill any…

654
00:40:52,473 --> 00:40:56,694
<i>.. completely unjustified.
They and all others must know</i>

655
00:40:56,695 --> 00:40:59,849
<i>that the United States
of America will not yield</i>

656
00:40:59,850 --> 00:41:02,943
<i>to International Terrorism
or to blackmail.</i>

657
00:41:03,030 --> 00:41:05,019
Sir, we'll be crashed.

658
00:41:05,067 --> 00:41:07,357
There's no enough time to…
– <i>.. are controlled by capitalists,</i>

659
00:41:07,358 --> 00:41:08,973
<i>and large oil companies.</i>

660
00:41:09,228 --> 00:41:13,471
<i>The United States government considers
revolutionists as terrorists,</i>

661
00:41:13,597 --> 00:41:19,729
<i>but itself and its CIA are the most
terrorizing organization of all time.</i>

662
00:41:24,651 --> 00:41:27,718
We'll find her ship,
we will find our chance.

663
00:41:28,413 --> 00:41:30,348
For the Argo lies my hope,

664
00:41:30,613 --> 00:41:32,624
my hero, my husband.

665
00:41:32,674 --> 00:41:35,912
<i>.. We will begin the trials and
carry out the sentences.</i>

666
00:41:35,913 --> 00:41:39,661
<i>.. We wonder where and how this apparently
endless parade of hatred will end.</i>

667
00:41:40,554 --> 00:41:41,817
What do they want?

668
00:41:41,825 --> 00:41:44,554
<i>They say the question should
be not 'what', but 'who'.</i>

669
00:41:44,564 --> 00:41:47,787
<i>The answer to this question is clear,
they want the former Shah,</i>

670
00:41:47,831 --> 00:41:51,129
<i>.. They should be ashamed
to talk about human rights.</i>

671
00:41:51,189 --> 00:41:53,439
<i>Carter and his government
have given asylum</i>

672
00:41:53,447 --> 00:41:54,987
<i>to the worst criminal.
– .. in this compound,</i>

673
00:41:54,992 --> 00:41:56,282
<i>for what, for life?</i>

674
00:41:56,501 --> 00:42:00,222
<i>They will remain until
the Shah is returned.</i>

675
00:42:00,390 --> 00:42:03,604
<i>But if the exiled Shah,
now in the New York City hospital,</i>

676
00:42:03,858 --> 00:42:07,043
<i>leaves the United States
for any place other than Iran,</i>

677
00:42:07,093 --> 00:42:10,754
<i>harsher decisions will be taken
against the hostages.</i>

678
00:42:16,515 --> 00:42:18,274
.. We go outside of the ship now,

679
00:42:18,322 --> 00:42:20,466
holding on a single red flower

680
00:42:20,515 --> 00:42:24,384
as it goes to the ruins
of the starship in the desert,

681
00:42:24,419 --> 00:42:28,271
fade to Back. The end.

682
00:42:33,478 --> 00:42:35,914
Here it is. What did I tell you!

683
00:42:36,169 --> 00:42:39,007
First shot of the picture.

684
00:42:42,588 --> 00:42:43,759
"Argo, fuck yourself."

685
00:42:44,024 --> 00:42:45,818
Argo, fuck yourself.

686
00:43:23,429 --> 00:43:24,553
Brace yourself.

687
00:43:24,587 --> 00:43:27,691
It's like talking to those two
old fucks from The Muppets.

688
00:43:31,506 --> 00:43:33,220
Aliens and robots?

689
00:43:34,371 --> 00:43:35,188
Yes, sir.

690
00:43:36,197 --> 00:43:39,283
You're telling me that there is a movie
company in Hollywood right now,

691
00:43:39,663 --> 00:43:41,608
that is funded by the CIA?

692
00:43:42,106 --> 00:43:43,659
– Yes, sir.

693
00:43:44,671 --> 00:43:46,495
What's wrong with the bikes again?

694
00:43:46,496 --> 00:43:48,224
We tried to get the message upstairs, sir.

695
00:43:48,256 --> 00:43:51,239
You think… you think this is
more plausible than teachers?

696
00:43:51,265 --> 00:43:54,673
Yes, we do. One, there are no more
foreign teachers in Iran…

697
00:43:54,697 --> 00:43:56,821
And we think everybody
knows Hollywood people,

698
00:43:56,829 --> 00:43:58,836
and everybody knows they
ain't shootin' Stalingrad,

699
00:43:58,837 --> 00:44:00,820
with Bob Hope directing
if it would sell tickets.

700
00:44:01,890 --> 00:44:03,847
There are only bad options,

701
00:44:04,361 --> 00:44:06,450
it's about finding the best one.

702
00:44:06,724 --> 00:44:08,812
You don't have a better
bad idea than this?

703
00:44:08,948 --> 00:44:11,718
This is the best bad idea we have, sir.

704
00:44:12,211 --> 00:44:13,331
By far.

705
00:44:21,291 --> 00:44:25,410
The United States Government has just
sanctioned your Science Fiction movie.

706
00:44:26,275 --> 00:44:28,206
Thank you, sir.

707
00:45:03,903 --> 00:45:09,594
I'm required to remind you that if you are
detained, the agency will not claim you.

708
00:45:10,515 --> 00:45:12,673
Barely claim me as it is.

709
00:45:13,808 --> 00:45:16,025
Is there any in case of obstacle?

710
00:45:16,123 --> 00:45:18,915
Just Christine.

711
00:45:21,054 --> 00:45:23,262
I should have brought some
books to read in prison.

712
00:45:23,411 --> 00:45:24,345
No.

713
00:45:24,753 --> 00:45:27,074
They'll kill you long before prison.

714
00:45:28,785 --> 00:45:30,672
– Thanks for the ride.
– Yeah.

715
00:45:40,384 --> 00:45:42,989
– Studio 6.
– We got a green light.

716
00:45:43,017 --> 00:45:45,292
Keep the office running
until you hear otherwise.

717
00:45:45,389 --> 00:45:48,415
– Argo fuck yourself.
– Argo fuck yourself.

718
00:46:06,278 --> 00:46:07,917
<i>Your attention please,</i>

719
00:46:08,019 --> 00:46:11,968
<i>this is the final calling for
British Airways flight 87.</i>

720
00:46:44,706 --> 00:46:47,574
We are a nation of 35 millions,

721
00:46:47,685 --> 00:46:52,306
and many of these people
are looking for to murder them.

722
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:55,502
Hey.

723
00:46:55,769 --> 00:46:56,542
Hey.

724
00:46:58,083 --> 00:46:59,391
Come to bed.

725
00:47:00,316 --> 00:47:02,100
Another 5 minutes.

726
00:47:13,139 --> 00:47:15,536
She pleaded with me.

727
00:47:16,272 --> 00:47:19,235
When it started in the streets
nine months ago, she…

728
00:47:20,643 --> 00:47:23,252
she begged for us to leave.

729
00:47:24,135 --> 00:47:26,571
She packed our bags.

730
00:47:26,659 --> 00:47:30,257
I said, "just- just a little bit longer".

731
00:47:32,848 --> 00:47:36,063
And all I was thinking was…

732
00:47:36,979 --> 00:47:39,040
"stay…

733
00:47:39,407 --> 00:47:41,231
this is good for me.

734
00:47:42,541 --> 00:47:43,832
Stay.

735
00:47:47,147 --> 00:47:49,605
Show Newsom you got the balls".

736
00:47:54,598 --> 00:47:57,794
I can't believe I put Kathy
in this position.

737
00:48:05,993 --> 00:48:08,341
I think we're gonna die here.

738
00:48:57,772 --> 00:49:02,064
"Iran is a hundred percent not
in a pre-revolutionary state".

739
00:49:02,142 --> 00:49:05,338
CIA brief, November, 1st, 1979.

740
00:49:05,530 --> 00:49:07,867
Can't be right all the time.

741
00:49:08,208 --> 00:49:09,545
Kevin?

742
00:49:09,562 --> 00:49:11,197
When did you get back?

743
00:49:12,168 --> 00:49:15,478
The Shah escaped on the 747
so laden with gold bars,

744
00:49:15,496 --> 00:49:17,833
that they didn't make it off the runway.

745
00:49:18,151 --> 00:49:19,486
But you kept busy.

746
00:49:19,588 --> 00:49:23,867
Fairing out the torture apparatus
of our friends fallen dictation.

747
00:49:24,676 --> 00:49:26,312
It's getting worse.

748
00:49:26,344 --> 00:49:29,899
Anyone that lands at Mehrabad
now fills in one of these.

749
00:49:30,607 --> 00:49:32,533
This strip makes a copy
to the one underneath,

750
00:49:32,584 --> 00:49:35,002
passenger keeps yellow,
airport keeps white,

751
00:49:35,010 --> 00:49:36,559
when you leave the country,
they match them up

752
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:38,852
to verify you came into the country
when you say you did.

753
00:49:38,888 --> 00:49:40,250
So if they look,

754
00:49:40,459 --> 00:49:42,997
they'll see I didn't come into
the country with six people.

755
00:49:43,473 --> 00:49:45,272
If they look.

756
00:49:47,513 --> 00:49:50,472
When you land, you should go straight
to the Ministry of Culture and…

757
00:49:50,791 --> 00:49:53,716
Islamic Guidance, kiss the ring.

758
00:49:54,170 --> 00:49:57,407
Get on record as having
applied for film permit.

759
00:49:57,550 --> 00:50:01,324
If they catch you later, at least they'll
be confused while they're torturing you.

760
00:50:04,195 --> 00:50:08,053
IRANIAN CONSULATE - TURKEY

761
00:50:19,199 --> 00:50:21,620
What will be the purpose
of your visit to Iran?

762
00:50:21,675 --> 00:50:25,177
Uh… film production. Business.

763
00:50:27,165 --> 00:50:30,104
Why didn't you get your visa in Canada?

764
00:50:31,317 --> 00:50:35,029
Well, I would have loved to, except my
boss didn't send a telex until I got here.

765
00:50:35,710 --> 00:50:39,409
If the guy had an intelligent thought
in his head, it would die of loneliness.

766
00:51:00,154 --> 00:51:02,242
The Times and AP found out six escaped.

767
00:51:03,191 --> 00:51:06,212
They know who they are, and they know
they're hiding out with the Canadians.

768
00:51:06,729 --> 00:51:08,409
Somebody withdrew on the family's talk.

769
00:51:08,435 --> 00:51:09,615
Mother of God.

770
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:12,616
Yeah I just put Vance on a plane to
take the head of eds to a circus,

771
00:51:12,638 --> 00:51:15,223
he thinks he can get him
to sit on it for now.

772
00:51:16,655 --> 00:51:18,729
You guy'd better get them.

773
00:51:19,087 --> 00:51:20,921
And get the hell out.

774
00:51:21,263 --> 00:51:24,676
The Captain has informed us
that we're entering Iranian airspace.

775
00:51:24,813 --> 00:51:28,543
We'll be coming through to collect
any remaining alcoholic beverages.

776
00:54:07,670 --> 00:54:09,970
This film crew is just yourself?

777
00:54:10,078 --> 00:54:12,755
No, we have six more from
Canada meeting us today.

778
00:54:12,891 --> 00:54:14,989
You'd like to film at the bazaar?

779
00:54:15,308 --> 00:54:17,769
The bazaar, maybe the palace.

780
00:54:18,017 --> 00:54:19,687
Landmark sites.

781
00:54:19,965 --> 00:54:21,300
I see.

782
00:54:22,330 --> 00:54:24,250
The exotic orients.

783
00:54:24,638 --> 00:54:27,453
Snake charmers, flying carpets.

784
00:54:28,822 --> 00:54:31,423
You came to us at a complicated time.

785
00:54:31,980 --> 00:54:35,001
Before the revolution forty percent
of the movie theaters in Tehran

786
00:54:35,006 --> 00:54:36,783
were showing pornograph.

787
00:54:37,216 --> 00:54:38,470
I understand.

788
00:54:38,581 --> 00:54:41,592
The function of this
office is purification,

789
00:54:41,910 --> 00:54:44,970
as well as promotion for the arts.

790
00:54:46,439 --> 00:54:49,111
I'll review this for the Ministry.

791
00:54:50,413 --> 00:54:51,874
Thank you.

792
00:54:51,897 --> 00:54:53,952
– Salam.
– Salam.

793
00:54:59,858 --> 00:55:02,538
Lester, you're working late.

794
00:55:02,670 --> 00:55:04,515
Until the dawns early light.

795
00:55:04,835 --> 00:55:08,794
You got stamina, Lester. I wanna be you.

796
00:55:08,850 --> 00:55:12,765
Well, I'm a hundred and fifty years
old, so you wouldn't be me for long.

797
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:23,945
– Ambassador.
– Ken Taylor.

798
00:55:24,039 --> 00:55:25,900
Thank you for what you're doing.

799
00:55:26,236 --> 00:55:29,536
I was expecting more of a G-Man look.

800
00:55:30,042 --> 00:55:32,560
I think you're thinking of the FBI, sir.

801
00:55:32,853 --> 00:55:34,541
Ah. This way.

802
00:55:47,399 --> 00:55:49,654
These are blank- you know, stamps…

803
00:55:49,831 --> 00:55:51,916
Yeah, I'll take care of this.

804
00:55:53,089 --> 00:55:54,606
How long?

805
00:55:54,968 --> 00:55:57,465
A day to prep their covers…
two if they need it.

806
00:55:57,513 --> 00:55:59,170
And- and you'll fly out with them?

807
00:55:59,245 --> 00:56:00,619
Yeah.

808
00:56:01,134 --> 00:56:02,726
There's something you should know.

809
00:56:03,039 --> 00:56:06,132
We think our housekeeper's
figured out who they are.

810
00:56:06,792 --> 00:56:11,186
We don't know if we can trust her.
So, sooner is better.

811
00:57:01,081 --> 00:57:02,516
Hi.

812
00:57:02,605 --> 00:57:04,555
Hi. My name's Kevin Harkins…

813
00:57:05,585 --> 00:57:07,230
and I'm gonna get you home.

814
00:57:08,571 --> 00:57:11,474
These are the screenplays
for your cover identities.

815
00:57:13,006 --> 00:57:15,282
It's- it's theater of the absurd.

816
00:57:15,320 --> 00:57:16,758
What are our chances?

817
00:57:16,866 --> 00:57:18,241
Chances are good.

818
00:57:18,336 --> 00:57:21,483
Good? Well, what's the uh…
what's the number value of good?

819
00:57:21,533 --> 00:57:24,549
A thirty percent chance of
being publicly executed?

820
00:57:24,659 --> 00:57:27,807
Can you- can you tell me what the
objection was to normal cover identities?

821
00:57:27,875 --> 00:57:30,021
There are no Canadians in
the country for no reason.

822
00:57:30,102 --> 00:57:31,403
They'll sniff us out regardless.

823
00:57:31,437 --> 00:57:34,436
The Swedish Consul, they- they accused him
of being an American at the airport,

824
00:57:34,437 --> 00:57:35,625
they held him for an hour.

825
00:57:35,631 --> 00:57:38,680
We can't hold upon that, we don't know
what the hell movie people do.

826
00:57:38,681 --> 00:57:40,758
That's why I'm here.

827
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:43,688
I'm gonna help you, I'm gonna be
with you the whole way. This is what I do.

828
00:57:44,643 --> 00:57:46,981
Have you gotten people
out this way before?

829
00:57:47,586 --> 00:57:49,770
This would be a first.

830
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:53,865
Do you know that everyday they catch
another friend of the Shah at the airport?

831
00:57:53,891 --> 00:57:55,816
– Joe…
– Kangaroo trials, and-

832
00:57:55,825 --> 00:57:59,206
And then firing squads just for having
American names in their phone books.

833
00:57:59,661 --> 00:58:01,103
You've been here and hour,

834
00:58:01,360 --> 00:58:04,333
and- and you're asking us to trust
you with our lives, Mr…

835
00:58:04,415 --> 00:58:05,816
Harkins.

836
00:58:06,071 --> 00:58:08,098
That's your real name?

837
00:58:08,202 --> 00:58:09,477
No.

838
00:58:12,266 --> 00:58:16,104
I know there are risks involved.
Serious risks.

839
00:58:16,623 --> 00:58:19,600
But it is time to go.

840
00:58:20,662 --> 00:58:23,191
We've got orders to close
the embassy and go back.

841
00:58:23,311 --> 00:58:25,517
There's nowhere for them to stay.

842
00:58:26,224 --> 00:58:29,198
We will never make it through
immigration at the airport.

843
00:58:29,333 --> 00:58:30,848
I'm serious.

844
00:58:30,904 --> 00:58:34,584
I mean no, this is what? The part we say,
this is so crazy it might actually work?

845
00:58:34,592 --> 00:58:36,587
– Come on!
– I saw in Burma, they get people out.

846
00:58:36,595 --> 00:58:39,722
Snitches and Banana Republic, they get
them over the border after the coup,

847
00:58:39,730 --> 00:58:41,997
pay the guards at the crossing a
hundred bucks to look the other way.

848
00:58:42,013 --> 00:58:44,132
You know, his opinion got us out
in the first place.

849
00:58:44,221 --> 00:58:48,115
If we go out there with fake passports,
we are spies, period, that's execution.

850
00:58:48,131 --> 00:58:49,451
You got a problem lying, Joe?

851
00:58:49,462 --> 00:58:51,411
But the point is, we can't stay here!

852
00:58:51,699 --> 00:58:55,077
If we get caught, you and Pat go on trial
for harboring the enemy, you know that.

853
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:58,185
Pat and I have discussed this,
it's the risk we took.

854
00:58:58,955 --> 00:59:01,960
That man out there has got bad
cards and he is going to lose,

855
00:59:01,970 --> 00:59:04,950
and if he loses… it's our lives.

856
00:59:06,336 --> 00:59:09,314
And his life too.

857
00:59:09,517 --> 00:59:12,199
Look, we don't have any alternatives.

858
00:59:12,324 --> 00:59:14,595
We gotta go.

859
00:59:19,659 --> 00:59:23,205
These cover identities were created
specifically for each one of you.

860
00:59:23,480 --> 00:59:26,013
What you need to do is memorize
everything that's inside.

861
00:59:26,139 --> 00:59:30,211
Who you are, what you are, where you've
been, complete bio. And then add to that:

862
00:59:30,504 --> 00:59:33,735
where do you vacation, what are you
allergies, who'd you have an affair with.

863
00:59:33,998 --> 00:59:35,249
The only way this works,

864
00:59:35,375 --> 00:59:38,805
is if you believe that you're these people
so much that you're dream like them.

865
00:59:40,073 --> 00:59:42,224
Get started tonight.

866
00:59:42,261 --> 00:59:45,240
I'll be back tomorrow. We'll get going.
Good luck.

867
00:59:50,945 --> 00:59:52,880
Wow, my guy kind of sucks.

868
00:59:52,977 --> 00:59:54,492
What's your name?

869
00:59:54,887 --> 00:59:57,575
Mike McEwan A.

870
00:59:58,001 --> 00:59:59,321
Sounds convincing.

871
00:59:59,349 --> 01:00:01,440
Kathy, what's your name?

872
01:00:29,126 --> 01:00:32,111
<i>The Loveboat will be seeing
fifteen minutes from now.</i>

873
01:00:33,562 --> 01:00:36,049
<i>.. insisted that the crisis in Afghanistan</i>

874
01:00:36,060 --> 01:00:39,893
<i>will not divert the attention of the United
States from the plight of the hostages.</i>

875
01:00:39,927 --> 01:00:43,155
<i>.. he seems to be if not impotent,
but at least reluctant…</i>

876
01:00:43,345 --> 01:00:46,779
<i>The United States finds itself
in such bitter confrontation</i>

877
01:00:46,787 --> 01:00:50,911
<i>with the Soviet Union over that
country's invasion of Afghanistan…</i>

878
01:00:51,218 --> 01:00:53,642
<i>The United States is now
moving towards the decision</i>

879
01:00:53,643 --> 01:00:56,144
<i>to boycott the summer
Olympics in Moscow.</i>

880
01:00:57,098 --> 01:01:00,869
Bad new, bad news. Even when
it's good news, it's bad news.

881
01:01:00,935 --> 01:01:04,586
John Wayne's in the ground six months,
this is what's left of America.

882
01:01:32,957 --> 01:01:35,226
The Minister of Culture and Guidance

883
01:01:35,227 --> 01:01:36,758
has approved your location scout.

884
01:01:36,793 --> 01:01:38,287
He will send his representative

885
01:01:38,288 --> 01:01:41,828
to meet you and your crew at the
Grand Bazaar tomorrow at 3 P.M.

886
01:01:42,755 --> 01:01:44,591
They called your bluff.

887
01:01:44,937 --> 01:01:47,415
– Maybe they're cooperating.
– Absolutely not.

888
01:01:47,581 --> 01:01:52,254
Seven Americans walking the bazaar
is asking for a riot, it's the hive.

889
01:01:52,524 --> 01:01:53,882
Seven Canadians, Jack.

890
01:01:53,924 --> 01:01:57,268
Never give them opening shots at a cover.

891
01:01:57,907 --> 01:02:00,565
– Are they even ready?
– They're getting there.

892
01:02:00,802 --> 01:02:02,784
There's no prize for most improvements.

893
01:02:02,809 --> 01:02:03,706
I don't have a choice.

894
01:02:03,714 --> 01:02:06,808
We say no, they show up at their residence
and drag everyone out at gun point.

895
01:02:06,831 --> 01:02:08,673
How well do you think their
covers are gonna hold up

896
01:02:08,674 --> 01:02:10,643
when they're getting their
fingernails pulled out?

897
01:02:30,409 --> 01:02:34,614
You want us to go the Grand Bazaar
at three o'clock in the afternoon?

898
01:02:35,171 --> 01:02:37,891
You said a day learning our cover
then straight to the airport.

899
01:02:38,002 --> 01:02:39,295
– Do they suspect something?

900
01:02:39,718 --> 01:02:42,978
What I know is we need to
pretend to be a movie crew.

901
01:02:43,070 --> 01:02:47,120
We go to the bazaar today, we
fly from the airport tomorrow.

902
01:02:48,539 --> 01:02:50,360
We won't do it.

903
01:02:51,804 --> 01:02:54,817
He told them that there are six of
us, so then they're expecting six,

904
01:02:54,835 --> 01:02:56,397
it would be suspicious not
to show up at this point.

905
01:02:56,426 --> 01:02:58,338
Goddammit, guys! What else
do we have to do?!

906
01:02:58,669 --> 01:03:00,166
Alright? What el- what-
what's the alternative?!

907
01:03:00,174 --> 01:03:01,916
We don't have to show them
the only cards we're holding,

908
01:03:01,917 --> 01:03:03,214
which is that they
don't know we're here!

909
01:03:03,222 --> 01:03:05,656
I get it! That's the ball game,
okay, we- you know,

910
01:03:05,703 --> 01:03:08,274
Look, we don't have any other…
other choice! What are we gonna do?!

911
01:03:08,279 --> 01:03:10,910
Who says that we'll know
our covers well enough?

912
01:03:10,930 --> 01:03:12,472
We're no in the CIA!

913
01:03:13,591 --> 01:03:14,954
It's suicide.

914
01:03:15,282 --> 01:03:17,501
I'm asking you to trust me.

915
01:03:18,693 --> 01:03:21,232
I don't trust you.

916
01:03:22,520 --> 01:03:23,976
This is the game, Joe.

917
01:03:24,077 --> 01:03:25,214
What world are you living in?

918
01:03:25,310 --> 01:03:26,289
What world am I…?

919
01:03:26,308 --> 01:03:29,131
The one where they're hanging people
from construction cranes, Bob!

920
01:03:29,132 --> 01:03:30,481
It's too dangerous,

921
01:03:30,520 --> 01:03:33,080
– I don't want to bring my wife into this.
– Joe, can you stop?

922
01:03:34,160 --> 01:03:35,700
Joe?

923
01:03:41,983 --> 01:03:43,900
So, we'll see you at two.

924
01:04:06,988 --> 01:04:12,324
So, don't be recognizable, but look
exactly like your passport photo.

925
01:04:13,264 --> 01:04:15,898
I haven't been this nervous
since our wedding.

926
01:04:17,470 --> 01:04:20,351
Only this isn't a huge mistake, hopefully.

927
01:04:20,745 --> 01:04:23,353
Like this… Okay.

928
01:04:25,607 --> 01:04:27,155
Hello?

929
01:04:29,770 --> 01:04:31,314
Hello?

930
01:04:31,967 --> 01:04:33,715
Hello?

931
01:04:39,876 --> 01:04:41,487
Who was that?

932
01:04:44,572 --> 01:04:46,506
– Mark?
– Yeah?

933
01:04:48,372 --> 01:04:49,982
I'm scared.

934
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:54,437
It's okay.

935
01:05:41,196 --> 01:05:42,541
Where are they?

936
01:05:42,787 --> 01:05:44,668
In the kitchen.

937
01:06:01,062 --> 01:06:03,041
This is what I do…

938
01:06:03,068 --> 01:06:04,756
I get people out…

939
01:06:06,154 --> 01:06:08,423
and I've never left anyone behind.

940
01:06:10,632 --> 01:06:13,384
I wish I could believe you, Mr. Harkins.

941
01:06:18,117 --> 01:06:20,178
My name is Tony Mendez.

942
01:06:20,679 --> 01:06:24,375
I'm from New York, my worked construction,
my mother teaches elementary school,

01:06:24,403 --> 01:06:27,014
I have a wife and a ten year old son.

944
01:06:29,432 --> 01:06:33,446
You play along with me today, I promise
you I will get you out tomorrow.

945
01:06:38,568 --> 01:06:39,973
Fuck.

946
01:07:49,591 --> 01:07:50,986
Hang on.

947
01:08:39,426 --> 01:08:41,246
You alright?

948
01:08:45,916 --> 01:08:48,351
Okay, tell me who you are?

949
01:08:48,970 --> 01:08:51,135

950
01:08:51,465 --> 01:08:53,957

Alright, let's go make the movie.

956
01:09:18,269 --> 01:09:20,437
Welcome, welcome,
my name is Reza Borhani.

957
01:09:20,463 --> 01:09:21,819
Kevin Harkins, I'm the producer.

958
01:09:21,891 --> 01:09:24,754

961
01:09:28,811 --> 01:09:30,299
– You are the director?
– Yes.

962
01:09:30,945 --> 01:09:33,313
Is this film a foreign brides film?

963
01:09:34,190 --> 01:09:35,622
I'm sorry?

964
01:09:35,693 --> 01:09:39,222
A film where a foreign bride
comes to Iran, but uh…

965
01:09:39,301 --> 01:09:42,545
she doesn't understand the
language or the customs,

966
01:09:42,587 --> 01:09:44,997
and there is misunderstandings and laughs?

967
01:09:45,053 --> 01:09:46,694
Oh, no.

968
01:09:51,454 --> 01:09:56,046
The bazaar in Tehran is one
of the largest in the world.

969
01:09:56,141 --> 01:09:57,804
[Farsi] Izar, salam, choukran.

970
01:09:57,849 --> 01:10:02,124
This Bazaar has been on this spot
for over 8000 years.

01:10:02,164 --> 01:10:07,666
You can find many items such as
paper, spices, precious metals,

972
01:10:07,788 --> 01:10:10,660
All, right here.
Uh, right this way.

973
01:10:10,693 --> 01:10:12,494
[Farsi]

974
01:10:15,573 --> 01:10:17,050
This way.

975
01:10:32,035 --> 01:10:33,580
– Uh, Mike?
– Yeah.

976
01:10:33,808 --> 01:10:35,374
If I was to say that you're looking
through the wrong end

977
01:10:35,382 --> 01:10:37,625
of that view finder, would I be right?

978
01:10:40,105 --> 01:10:41,521
Yeah.

979
01:10:48,998 --> 01:10:50,715
Just a little bit now.

980
01:11:00,838 --> 01:11:02,503
[Farsi]

981
01:11:02,686 --> 01:11:04,701
[Farsi]

982
01:11:19,715 --> 01:11:22,776
Please wait here, let's uh, stay together.

983
01:11:39,965 --> 01:11:41,757
He wants to know the
photograph you took…

984
01:11:41,810 --> 01:11:44,695
It's okay, it's her job to take
photographs. Production design.

985
01:11:45,101 --> 01:11:48,244
He says, he did not give you permission
to take photograph of his store.

986
01:11:48,349 --> 01:11:50,346
Well that's okay, you can
tell him he can have it.

987
01:11:53,288 --> 01:11:55,579
Please, please take that photograph.

988
01:12:25,421 --> 01:12:28,723
He's saying that the Shah killed
his son with an American gun.

989
01:12:38,979 --> 01:12:41,603
No! Canada! Cana- Canada!

990
01:12:41,691 --> 01:12:44,531
Ι'd lіkе tо ѕuggеѕt thаt
wе аrе еndіng thіѕ vіѕіt!

991
01:12:47,731 --> 01:12:49,346
Let's go off this now!

992
01:14:12,166 --> 01:14:13,579
How did it go?

993
01:14:15,116 --> 01:14:17,684
What about tomorrow?

994
01:14:17,940 --> 01:14:20,424
Tomorrow they'll be ready.

995
01:14:41,373 --> 01:14:46,093
A man in Scranton is placing a flag
in his lawn for every day of captivity.

996
01:14:46,330 --> 01:14:49,949
He runs out of lawn,
Kennedy wins the primary.

997
01:14:50,039 --> 01:14:52,839
The six with the Canadians are coming out.

998
01:15:03,672 --> 01:15:05,289
Who signed off on this?

999
01:15:05,377 --> 01:15:07,311
You! Where was your passport issued?

1000
01:15:07,402 --> 01:15:08,859
– Vancouver.
– Where were you born?

1001
01:15:08,910 --> 01:15:10,276
– Toronto
– "Torono".

1002
01:15:10,300 --> 01:15:11,597
Canadians don't pronounce the T.

1003
01:15:11,641 --> 01:15:14,217
Some Komiteh guard is
actually gonna know that?

1004
01:15:14,353 --> 01:15:17,931
If you're detained for questioning they
will bring out someone who knows that, yes.

1005
01:15:18,284 --> 01:15:21,844
Mary, who were the last three
Prime Ministers to Canada?

1006
01:15:22,065 --> 01:15:24,486
Uh… Trudeau, Pearson and Diefenbaker.

– Where were you born?
– Halifax, Nova Scotia.

01:15:30,840 --> 01:15:32,322

February 21st, 1952.

1012
01:15:35,115 --> 01:15:36,771
Good. What's your job on the movie?

the last movie you produced?

1016
01:15:42,549 --> 01:15:44,528

What's your middle name?

1017
01:15:44,547 --> 01:15:46,514
– Leon…-
– Shoot him! He's an American spy.

1018
01:15:47,900 --> 01:15:50,199
Look, they're gonna try
and break you. Okay?

1019
01:15:50,240 --> 01:15:51,731
By trying to get you agitated.

1020
01:15:51,780 --> 01:15:53,661
You have to know your
resume back to front.

1021
01:15:53,691 --> 01:15:55,913
Do you really believe your little
story's gonna make a difference

1022
01:15:55,926 --> 01:15:58,304
when there's a gun to our heads?

1023
01:15:59,275 --> 01:16:02,804
I think my story is the only thing
between you and a gun to your head.

1024
01:16:04,766 --> 01:16:06,189
That's right.

1025
01:16:11,959 --> 01:16:15,006
Hey. They made it through
the location scout.

1026
01:16:27,058 --> 01:16:29,197
You have a call.

1027
01:16:39,703 --> 01:16:42,948
– What is it?
– Go to black on green.

1028
01:16:44,416 --> 01:16:45,811
Go.

1029
01:16:45,862 --> 01:16:47,540
– It all just changed.
– What?

1030
01:16:47,595 --> 01:16:49,402
They're calling it again,
you gotta come back.

1031
01:16:49,517 --> 01:16:50,925
– What?
– Flight Chiefs are planning

1032
01:16:50,940 --> 01:16:53,091
a military rescue of the hostages,

1033
01:16:53,114 --> 01:16:56,630
Delta Force started training
to storm the grounds. So,

1034
01:16:56,673 --> 01:16:59,377
if the six of them are brought down there,

1035
01:16:59,444 --> 01:17:01,502
they won't be held for long.

1036
01:17:02,495 --> 01:17:06,088
Goddammit! I never would have exposed them
if I wasn't authorized to get them out!

1037
01:17:06,128 --> 01:17:08,806
– It's over, Tony.
– If they stay here, they will be taken.

1038
01:17:08,904 --> 01:17:11,685
– Probably not alive.
– Listen to me!

1039
01:17:11,878 --> 01:17:13,513
The thinking has changed.

1040
01:17:13,682 --> 01:17:16,895
Six Americans get pulled out of
the Canadian diplomat's house

1041
01:17:16,907 --> 01:17:19,411
and executed, it's a world outrage.

1042
01:17:19,911 --> 01:17:23,175
Six Americans get caught
playing movie make-believe

1043
01:17:23,184 --> 01:17:25,634
with the CIA at the airport and executed,

1044
01:17:25,797 --> 01:17:30,591
it's a national embarrassment.
They are calling the operation.

1045
01:17:33,070 --> 01:17:35,635
We're responsible for these people.

1046
01:17:36,463 --> 01:17:40,045
What we are is required to follow orders.

1047
01:17:40,261 --> 01:17:41,767
I'm sorry.

1048
01:17:59,373 --> 01:18:00,919
Come in.

1049
01:18:01,799 --> 01:18:04,758
We're ready to try again.

1050
01:18:05,661 --> 01:18:07,117
You're ready.

1051
01:18:07,283 --> 01:18:09,211
You worked hard.

1052
01:18:09,671 --> 01:18:13,177
Probably the best thing to do
for you right now would be…

1053
01:18:13,344 --> 01:18:15,163
just to relax.

1054
01:18:15,688 --> 01:18:17,123
Okay.

1055
01:18:17,397 --> 01:18:18,900
You did good.

1056
01:18:19,654 --> 01:18:21,161
Thanks.

1057
01:18:47,329 --> 01:18:50,248
So you know.

1058
01:18:50,342 --> 01:18:54,524
Exfil wants you to burn the
passports before you leave.

1059
01:18:56,190 --> 01:18:58,063
If you tell them now, they'll panic.

1060
01:18:58,082 --> 01:19:00,581
I think it's best if you just don't show.

1061
01:19:02,719 --> 01:19:05,297
It was always a fucked mission.

1062
01:19:05,771 --> 01:19:08,534
You came closer than anybody else.

1063
01:21:37,149 --> 01:21:38,337
It's off…

1064
01:21:38,350 --> 01:21:40,470
they want us to pack up the office.

1065
01:21:43,083 --> 01:21:46,288
This can wait. Let's go get a drink.

1066
01:22:10,344 --> 01:22:12,375
He's late.

1067
01:22:26,014 --> 01:22:26,965
O'Donnell.

1068
01:22:27,012 --> 01:22:29,996
Somebody's responsible
when things happen, Jack.

1069
01:22:30,943 --> 01:22:32,346
I'm responsible.

1070
01:22:32,724 --> 01:22:34,290
I'm taking them through.

1071
01:22:34,541 --> 01:22:36,179
Tony?

1072
01:22:45,239 --> 01:22:46,927
Alan! Alan,

1073
01:22:46,953 --> 01:22:49,721
we need to confirm those seven
tickets out of Tehran on Swissair.

1074
01:22:49,737 --> 01:22:50,941
Engell shut that down.

1075
01:22:50,987 --> 01:22:52,431
I say it's back on!

1076
01:22:52,486 --> 01:22:54,695
– I can't do it, it's back stopped!
– Wait wait, wait a minute!

1077
01:22:55,235 --> 01:22:56,782
What the hell are you talking
about, back stopped,

1078
01:22:56,790 --> 01:22:58,163
what the hell does that mean?

1079
01:22:58,207 --> 01:23:00,969
Carter's gotta say yes
for us to get the tickets.

1080
01:23:11,044 --> 01:23:12,444
Time to go.

1081
01:23:22,852 --> 01:23:24,286
Alright.

1082
01:23:25,252 --> 01:23:27,937
– Where's Engell?
– Uh, he's in a meeting.

1083
01:23:28,059 --> 01:23:29,881
Pull him out.

1084
01:23:31,205 --> 01:23:32,377
Pull him out!

1085
01:23:34,765 --> 01:23:36,653
Thank you. See you soon.

1086
01:23:36,663 --> 01:23:38,067
Sahar's on the bus.

1087
01:23:38,173 --> 01:23:40,243
– Great.
– Sahar will be fine.

1088
01:23:40,291 --> 01:23:42,465
– Thank you.
– Thank you!

1089
01:23:42,490 --> 01:23:43,866
You two leave right now.

1090
01:23:43,898 --> 01:23:45,693
We'll leave on the train in half an hour.

1091
01:23:45,733 --> 01:23:47,153
Good.

1092
01:23:50,649 --> 01:23:52,092
And he said no.

1093
01:23:52,125 --> 01:23:54,219
This is not a long leisure
and it never has been,

1094
01:23:54,243 --> 01:23:56,076
and you don't decide if it goes!

1095
01:23:56,495 --> 01:23:58,175
It is going!

1096
01:23:58,374 --> 01:24:00,356
Jack. You are this close.

1097
01:24:00,383 --> 01:24:02,141
Am I? Am I really that close?

1098
01:24:02,188 --> 01:24:03,610
You are this Goddamn close to-

1099
01:24:03,637 --> 01:24:07,941
I am not gonna leave him at the airport
with six people and his dick in his hand.

1100
01:24:08,030 --> 01:24:10,074
You tell the director
to call the White House!

1101
01:24:10,134 --> 01:24:11,896
Do your fucking job!

1102
01:24:20,166 --> 01:24:23,024
– Get to your plane, Claude
– Oui monsieur.

1103
01:24:28,526 --> 01:24:32,269
First time anyone's gonna ask you
a question is at the first check point.

1104
01:24:32,469 --> 01:24:35,270
The first check point is just to
get a look at your passports.

1105
01:24:35,601 --> 01:24:38,417
Passports came straight from
Ottawa last week. They're clean.

1106
01:24:39,351 --> 01:24:41,481
You're gonna find White
House Chief of Staff!

1107
01:24:41,564 --> 01:24:42,827
How would I find him?

1108
01:24:42,955 --> 01:24:46,022
We're a fucking spy agency! Find him!

1109
01:24:46,558 --> 01:24:49,772
The second check point is immigration.

1110
01:24:50,127 --> 01:24:51,910
You're each gonna hand them one of these.

1111
01:24:51,995 --> 01:24:54,926
It says that you landed in
the country two days ago.

1112
01:24:55,032 --> 01:24:57,964
They'll look for the matching
white one, which doesn't exist.

1113
01:24:58,130 --> 01:25:00,474
You'll say you don't know what happened…

1114
01:25:00,500 --> 01:25:02,906
and if you believe they
lost they white set,

1115
01:25:03,173 --> 01:25:04,697
they'll believe it too.

1116
01:25:05,040 --> 01:25:08,595
Jordan's in the West Wing,
he's not taking calls.

1117
01:25:09,967 --> 01:25:11,532
Where are his kids?

1118
01:25:11,623 --> 01:25:12,766
What?

1119
01:25:12,845 --> 01:25:15,323
Where do his kids go to school?

1120
01:25:21,598 --> 01:25:23,000
Thank you, thank you.

1121
01:25:23,082 --> 01:25:25,927
Pace Academy, Buckhead, Georgia.

1122
01:25:28,844 --> 01:25:29,992
White House.

1123
01:25:30,097 --> 01:25:34,246
Yes, this is Mr. Murphy from Pace
Academy calling for Mr. Jordan.

1124
01:25:34,793 --> 01:25:37,183
Yeah, I'm afraid it is an emergency.

1125
01:25:37,409 --> 01:25:40,061
Hold for the Chief of Staff's Office.

1126
01:25:40,212 --> 01:25:42,206
The third check point is the trap.

1127
01:25:42,326 --> 01:25:44,250
It's manned by the Revolutionary Guard,

1128
01:25:44,313 --> 01:25:47,339
most of them were educated
in the U.S and Europe…

1129
01:25:47,505 --> 01:25:50,479
and all of them are looking for Americans.

1130
01:26:02,650 --> 01:26:04,341
– Hello?
– Jack O'Donnell from CI-

1131
01:26:04,373 --> 01:26:05,412
– Wait, wait! Who?

1132
01:26:05,484 --> 01:26:07,541
Iran Guesthouse operation is ready now,

1133
01:26:07,551 --> 01:26:09,239
if we don't have the President's go ahead,

1134
01:26:09,249 --> 01:26:10,780
they are going to be captured.

1135
01:26:11,667 --> 01:26:13,354
David, pick up!

1136
01:26:30,475 --> 01:26:33,078
Zurich, it's under Harkins.

1137
01:26:41,083 --> 01:26:44,480
I'm sorry sir, I don't see
you'd have these reservations.

1138
01:26:47,275 --> 01:26:49,115
Telex for Flash!

1139
01:26:49,953 --> 01:26:54,039
Would you mind checking again, please?

1140
01:27:00,778 --> 01:27:04,097
Copy D.S., confirm the tickets, go!

1141
01:27:17,002 --> 01:27:19,524
My apologies, they just came through.

1142
01:27:26,372 --> 01:27:28,078
Swisair says they picked up the tickets.

1143
01:27:28,097 --> 01:27:30,564
Get the L.A. office, tell them
to be ready, in case they call.

1144
01:27:30,646 --> 01:27:33,216
We told them to shut that down.

1145
01:28:04,397 --> 01:28:05,901
There you go.

1146
01:28:22,640 --> 01:28:24,460
Not here.

1147
01:29:27,194 --> 01:29:29,371
When did you come through Iran?

1148
01:29:29,569 --> 01:29:31,184
Two days ago.

1149
01:29:31,361 --> 01:29:33,410
What was the purpose of your visit?

1150
01:29:34,042 --> 01:29:37,368
We are looking for locations for a film.

1151
01:29:43,530 --> 01:29:45,449
– We have a….
– Oh, yeah,

1152
01:29:45,522 --> 01:29:49,694
I've got a letter from
the Ministry of Culture.

1153
01:29:50,411 --> 01:29:52,678
If you want to look at that.

1154
01:30:14,473 --> 01:30:15,971
You can go.

1155
01:30:24,761 --> 01:30:26,194
Come on, come on.

1156
01:30:50,706 --> 01:30:52,021
Passports.

1157
01:30:52,121 --> 01:30:53,911
No passports, no plane.

1158
01:30:57,743 --> 01:30:59,281
Passports.

1159
01:31:04,184 --> 01:31:05,796
Passports.

1160
01:31:15,078 --> 01:31:16,425
[Farsi]

1161
01:31:48,597 --> 01:31:49,899
We're together yes, uh-

1162
01:31:53,938 --> 01:31:56,301
Pierson's telling Swissair
they're not on the plane.

1163
01:31:56,333 --> 01:31:57,659
They should have boarded already.

1164
01:31:57,695 --> 01:31:59,571
Still no answer in L.A.

1165
01:32:24,334 --> 01:32:25,324
Sir.

1166
01:33:06,253 --> 01:33:08,682
N-No, I'm… I'm now a writer, and uh…

1167
01:33:09,887 --> 01:33:11,945
Kevin, give me the storyboards.

1168
01:34:02,583 --> 01:34:05,972
You don't go until we verify.

1169
01:34:09,084 --> 01:34:11,502
– I understand.
– Sir…

1170
01:34:11,948 --> 01:34:13,733
Call our office.

1171
01:34:13,851 --> 01:34:15,495
They'll verify.

1172
01:34:40,325 --> 01:34:42,259
.. It goes all the way
throughout the thirties.

1173
01:34:42,291 --> 01:34:43,062
Hold on pal, we're shooting.

1174
01:34:43,063 --> 01:34:44,439
We're just going to the
producer's building.

1175
01:34:44,478 --> 01:34:46,923
Yeah I understand, I understand
but we're shooting.

1176
01:35:21,045 --> 01:35:25,695
<i>Swissair announces final boarding
to flight 3-6-3 to Zurich.</i>

1177
01:35:32,880 --> 01:35:34,700
Recess, back to one!

1178
01:35:35,203 --> 01:35:36,932
– Alright, recess.
– We going again!

1179
01:35:37,305 --> 01:35:40,257
Again, everyone!
And… we're rolling!

1180
01:35:40,287 --> 01:35:43,106
– We're going to the producer's building.
– Sorry, we're rolling

1181
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:21,806
Sorry pal, we're gonna be in the movie.
Call my agency.

1182
01:36:21,841 --> 01:36:23,357
Sir!

1183
01:36:35,458 --> 01:36:37,928
Studio 6 Productions.

1184
01:36:38,034 --> 01:36:40,540
May I speak to a Mr. Kevin Harkins?

1185
01:36:40,671 --> 01:36:43,954
I'm sorry, Mr. Harkins is out of
country on a location scout.

1186
01:36:43,962 --> 01:36:45,723
May I take a message?

1187
01:37:02,446 --> 01:37:05,960
Doors are closing for
flight 3-6-3 to Zurich.

1188
01:37:14,647 --> 01:37:16,750
– We can go.
– Excellent.

1189
01:37:24,396 --> 01:37:27,731
You can these. It's a gift.

1190
01:37:40,103 --> 01:37:42,911
[Farsi] Wait a moment.
Others are coming.

1191
01:39:59,407 --> 01:40:02,862
Swissair 3-6-3, clearance for taxi.

1192
01:40:04,782 --> 01:40:09,317
Swissair 3-6-3, you are
number two for departure.

1193
01:40:57,256 --> 01:41:00,490
Swissair 3-6-3, you are
cleared for take off.

1194
01:41:04,038 --> 01:41:06,682
Swissair 3-6-3,
clear for take off.

1195
01:42:11,631 --> 01:42:14,979
– We got wheels up!
– Wait.

1196
01:42:29,627 --> 01:42:31,946
Ladies and gentlemen,
it is our pleasure to announce

1197
01:42:31,957 --> 01:42:34,027
that alcoholic beverages
are now available

1198
01:42:34,030 --> 01:42:36,642
as we have cleared Iranian airspace.

1199
01:43:24,859 --> 01:43:26,229
They're clear.

1200
01:43:26,949 --> 01:43:28,896
Yes! Yes!

1201
01:43:33,393 --> 01:43:34,981
They're out!

1202
01:43:35,604 --> 01:43:37,371
They're out. They're out!

1203
01:43:37,387 --> 01:43:39,207
Yes! We got them out!

1204
01:43:41,835 --> 01:43:43,546
They're out!

1205
01:43:49,452 --> 01:43:51,619
Great work, boys.

1206
01:43:51,707 --> 01:43:53,378
We've managed!

1207
01:44:03,868 --> 01:44:07,176
You are admitted to the republic of Iraq.

1208
01:44:52,395 --> 01:44:54,504
We made history today.

1209
01:44:55,337 --> 01:44:58,779
" History starts out as farce
and ends up as tragedy".

1210
01:44:59,223 --> 01:45:01,120
Or it's the other way around.

1211
01:45:01,380 --> 01:45:02,584
And who said it?

1212
01:45:02,750 --> 01:45:04,203
Marx.

1213
01:45:04,913 --> 01:45:08,018
Groucho said that?

1214
01:45:10,530 --> 01:45:13,512
Called 'The Times' to nail
it to the Goddamn door.

1215
01:45:13,555 --> 01:45:14,912
CIA are the good guys.

1216
01:45:14,924 --> 01:45:16,820
The Canadians are the good guys

1217
01:45:17,124 --> 01:45:19,376
And if we're not agreeing, them too.

1218
01:45:19,418 --> 01:45:23,773
Only. Canada takes the credit, or
they'll retaliate against the hostages.

1219
01:45:24,828 --> 01:45:26,724
Great Satan wasn't involved.

1220
01:45:27,499 --> 01:45:29,550
No CIA.

1221
01:45:29,641 --> 01:45:31,667
Is that right, Jack?

1222
01:45:33,434 --> 01:45:35,345
Involved in what?

1223
01:45:36,012 --> 01:45:39,222
We were surprised as anybody.

1224
01:45:41,463 --> 01:45:43,322
Thank you, Canada.

1225
01:45:43,464 --> 01:45:45,992
<i>We knew that each day
that they stayed there,</i>

1226
01:45:45,993 --> 01:45:48,332
<i>the danger was becoming greater.</i>

1227
01:45:48,428 --> 01:45:52,378
<i>We had been looking for a solution to have
them to leave the country during the past-</i>

1228
01:45:52,405 --> 01:45:55,783
<i>.. Day 87, and finally a sliver
of really good news…</i>

1229
01:45:55,855 --> 01:45:58,342
.. American department of State
hereby honors

1230
01:45:58,941 --> 01:46:00,597
Joe Stafford…

1231
01:46:01,206 --> 01:46:02,613
Kathy Stafford…

1232
01:46:04,144 --> 01:46:05,745
Mark Lijek…

1233
01:46:06,675 --> 01:46:09,483
The Americans will be forever grateful

1234
01:46:09,536 --> 01:46:11,724
to our great and ally to the North,

1235
01:46:11,736 --> 01:46:14,360
for the protection and safe passage,

1236
01:46:14,458 --> 01:46:16,145
provided to our diplomats.

1237
01:46:16,257 --> 01:46:17,511
– Bob Anders…

1238
01:46:17,901 --> 01:46:20,318
Here or anywhere in the world…

1239
01:46:20,414 --> 01:46:22,286
Canada will pay…

1240
01:46:23,685 --> 01:46:27,549
for this violation of the
sovereignty of Iran.

1241
01:46:27,674 --> 01:46:32,203
.. ambassador Ken Taylor
and the great nation of Canada.

1242
01:46:35,950 --> 01:46:38,214
So I'm sitting in Jerry's this morning,

1243
01:46:38,333 --> 01:46:39,968
I'm having breakfast.
Waitress comes over to me,

1244
01:46:40,036 --> 01:46:41,841
she's waving a newspaper, she says:

1245
01:46:41,891 --> 01:46:43,679
'You see what those Canadians pulled off?

1246
01:46:43,815 --> 01:46:45,925
Why can't we do something like that?"

1247
01:46:46,054 --> 01:46:48,248
I said to her, do you know what I said?

1248
01:46:48,431 --> 01:46:49,830
No, what?

1249
01:46:49,986 --> 01:46:52,618
"Argo, fuck yourself!"

1250
01:47:20,587 --> 01:47:22,108
All set.

1251
01:47:22,426 --> 01:47:24,246
Thanks a lot.

1252
01:47:38,206 --> 01:47:40,967
And I left my autograph book at home.

1253
01:47:46,252 --> 01:47:49,586
His eminence called me.
He wants to see you.

1254
01:47:49,843 --> 01:47:52,373
Probably wants to fire me himself.

1255
01:47:52,749 --> 01:47:55,941
He wants to give you
the Intelligence Star.

1256
01:47:56,223 --> 01:47:58,054
You're getting the highest award of merit

1257
01:47:58,057 --> 01:48:01,737
of the clandestine services
of these United States.

1258
01:48:02,547 --> 01:48:04,469
Ceremony's on the fourteenth.

1259
01:48:04,812 --> 01:48:08,571
If they push it a week I can bring
Ian, that's his winter break.

1260
01:48:09,461 --> 01:48:13,665
The op was classified. So…
the ceremony's classified.

1261
01:48:13,751 --> 01:48:17,383
He can't know about it,
nobody can know about it.

1262
01:48:18,514 --> 01:48:22,360
So they're just gonna give me an award,
then they're gonna take it back.

1263
01:48:22,433 --> 01:48:24,170
That's right.

1264
01:48:25,110 --> 01:48:28,551
If we wanted applause we would
would have joined the circus.

1265
01:48:28,733 --> 01:48:31,427
– I thought we did.
– Yeah.

1266
01:48:31,639 --> 01:48:35,042
Carter said you were a great American.

1267
01:48:35,419 --> 01:48:37,004
Great American what?

1268
01:48:37,601 --> 01:48:39,424
He didn't say.

1269
01:48:52,366 --> 01:48:55,089
What happened to your picture?

1270
01:48:55,324 --> 01:48:57,605
It's in turn around.

1271
01:49:38,550 --> 01:49:40,930
Can I come in?

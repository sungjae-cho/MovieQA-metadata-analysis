Translated: Bambula

84
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,740
What the...?

85
00:13:43,407 --> 00:13:46,471
Tata, white at the door.

86
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,739
How can I help my friend?

87
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:53,471
What are you doing in my apartment?
- I do not speak French?

88
00:13:53,607 --> 00:13:58,006
No, I'm American.
I live here.

89
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:00,939
On which floor?
- No, it means that live here.

90
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:06,540
You? You're the owner?
I'm glad to finally meet you.

91
00:14:06,807 --> 00:14:09,806
Greet owners.
This is his apartment.

92
00:14:10,407 --> 00:14:12,007
Good day, friend.

93
00:14:12,407 --> 00:14:15,276
This is my wife, Teresa.
My son Abatte.

94
00:14:15,473 --> 00:14:17,493
My daughter Sumi is in the kitchen,
pregnant.

95
00:14:17,494 --> 00:14:19,939
These are my cousins.
They came to visit us from Mali,

96
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:22,367
until they go to stay with my brother in
Saint Dannyiu.

97
00:14:22,473 --> 00:14:26,139
Do you know Saint Danny?
- No. I do not know Saint Danny.

98
00:14:29,807 --> 00:14:32,006
What are you doing in my apartment?
- We had nowhere to go.

99
00:14:32,073 --> 00:14:34,306
We were looking for shelter.
You're lucky to be here.

100
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:36,885
Evil spirits inhabit the space. - Yes, but...

101
00:14:36,886 --> 00:14:39,764
now I'm back. - And it's good to have you
finally returned.

102
00:14:39,765 --> 00:14:42,260
My name is Zul. - Ethan.

103
00:14:45,073 --> 00:14:49,013
Where all my stuff?
- I also started painting this room.

104
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,826
My wife thinks it's best to have a
cheerful color.

105
00:14:51,827 --> 00:14:55,206
Do you like yellow? I look forward to
work. Not a problem, Ethan.

106
00:14:55,207 --> 00:14:57,539
Actually, Jules, there is a problem.

107
00:15:02,473 --> 00:15:06,334
I'm afraid that nothing can make up to 13
April.

108
00:15:06,335 --> 00:15:07,939
This is only for a month.

109
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:11,406
We have laws that protect
and squatters during the winter.

110
00:15:13,007 --> 00:15:16,807
Then I guess it is something I
throw. - No, no.

111
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:21,872
This is not a good idea. Because you go in
jail for breaking the law.

112
00:15:22,407 --> 00:15:26,139
I'll... I'll go to jail?
- Of course!

113
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:30,406
So, what exactly should I do?
- Wait for Spring.

114
00:15:30,407 --> 00:15:34,399
Like the birds, bees,
girls and boys.

115
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:37,272
Did you really say that?

116
00:15:42,331 --> 00:15:44,762
Ethan, Ethan!

117
00:15:47,494 --> 00:15:49,190
I need to talk to your father.

118
00:15:51,961 --> 00:15:54,288
Please give me
minutes to finish the conversation.

119
00:15:59,097 --> 00:16:03,402
I'm sorry, Ethan. - Let's talk
private, Jules, in my room.

120
00:16:07,586 --> 00:16:10,265
Assure you,
're not touching your stuff.

121
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:13,111
I'm not saying that you have touched.

122
00:16:14,258 --> 00:16:16,806
But I think it's time to
bit better.

123
00:16:18,196 --> 00:16:21,539
Because no intrusion is only
so in someone's apartment.

124
00:16:23,407 --> 00:16:26,539
No problem, Ethan.
'll Pack my bag and go.

125
00:16:27,807 --> 00:16:32,339
's Okay, forest. Go.
- Where do you get pregnant with your child?

126
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:38,473
I do not know, but we'll go
without packaging. - Sit down.

127
00:16:48,082 --> 00:16:50,208
Do not need more to go, Jules, at least...

128
00:16:50,824 --> 00:16:53,702
not when your daughter is born,

129
00:16:56,340 --> 00:17:00,607
but remain under my rules.
- I also believe in rules.

130
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:03,368
The first rule, no more
to enter this room.

131
00:17:03,403 --> 00:17:08,539
No one, of course. I'll put a higher mark.
- That's right, put more character.

132
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:12,339
Second rule,
always do what I say, no questions asked.

133
00:17:12,807 --> 00:17:14,407
Yes, of course.

134
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:18,806
And the third rule, do not be afraid
more room.

135
00:17:19,673 --> 00:17:24,406
Do not like the color? - I do not. - I told the woman that
yellow color is not for men.

136
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:26,539
No, black is not a color for men.

137
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:32,539
You also have a daughter?
- Yes.

138
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:34,940
Like the forest.

139
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:40,672
Okay, okay, no more yellow.

140
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:01,672
Who is the most beautiful girl in the world?
Is that you? - Look, Daddy!

141
00:18:01,673 --> 00:18:03,273
This is so cute!

142
00:18:09,469 --> 00:18:11,069
Come on, come on!

143
00:18:24,537 --> 00:18:28,607
Hi, Christine.

144
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:33,940

This is Christine. - Hi, Tina.

146
00:18:48,407 --> 00:18:51,726
I am currently in a meeting, so far

147
00:18:52,726 --> 00:18:55,739
I do not want to talk.
I want to see.

148
00:18:57,207 --> 00:19:00,747
Yeah, I'm really busy, so...

149
00:19:00,748 --> 00:19:04,485
Unless urgent... -
I need you to look any legal matter

150
00:19:04,557 --> 00:19:07,957
before you leave town.
- Why?

151
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:12,939
're Getting married you?
- No. Why? You're getting married?

152
00:19:13,965 --> 00:19:18,870
No, not today.
- I'll meet you there.

153
00:19:20,272 --> 00:19:21,872
Well, see you.

154

Yes. Yes. I started a fund for college.

157
00:19:49,225 --> 00:19:52,872
How sudden interest?
- Not unexpectedly, Tina.

158
00:19:53,407 --> 00:19:56,739
I try to stay in touch.
I left a message for her birthday.

159
00:19:57,461 --> 00:20:01,540
Yes, and now will have to wait another year
to hear again.

160
00:20:02,073 --> 00:20:07,072
I'm Tina. - You think this is easy for me
? - No, I'm...

161
00:20:09,473 --> 00:20:11,073
I'm sick.

162
00:20:13,473 --> 00:20:15,739
I mean,

00:20:54,431 --> 00:20:57,630
Do not Look deep into too.
Falling apart.

170
00:20:58,431 --> 00:21:00,764
I know that I was not there for you and Zoey.

171
00:21:03,098 --> 00:21:04,964
I want to see before I leave.

172
00:21:10,955 --> 00:21:12,783
You have to promise me something.

173
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:18,791
I'll let you see the

174
00:21:20,831 --> 00:21:25,657

00:21:26,533 --> 00:21:28,598
Am.

176
00:21:29,898 --> 00:21:33,430

177
00:21:38,431 --> 00:21:40,630
I should have let it go a long time ago.

178
00:21:41,765 --> 00:21:43,964
I'll be fine.
I have a full day planned. First...

00:21:47,698 --> 00:21:50,655
You'll have to catch up
material. - Hi, honey. - Hi.

181
00:21:55,030 --> 00:21:56,630
Hi, Zoey.

182
00:21:59,030 --> 00:22:00,630
How are you?

183
00:22:02,727 --> 00:22:06,430
Hello, how are you?
- I'm fine, thank you.

184
00:22:07,431 --> 00:22:09,031
Good.

185
00:22:09,165 --> 00:22:13,050
Mama please do not cry. I'm fine.
- No, I just... I'll be home at 8:30.

186
00:22:13,983 --> 00:22:17,630
Okay? - What should we do?
- Well, you say that I cook?

187
00:22:18,498 --> 00:22:20,098
Worth.

188
00:22:21,965 --> 00:22:25,164
Do you want me to call you Daddy
or just Ethan?

189
00:22:26,165 --> 00:22:27,765
I think I like the dad.

190
00:22:29,898 --> 00:22:33,430
Favorite place to go after school?
- We do not have a favorite place.

191
00:22:33,631 --> 00:22:35,251
Flying chairs, remember?

192
00:22:35,935 --> 00:22:39,058
Well, Ethan, we do
do, right?

193
00:22:39,093 --> 00:22:41,597
I know you probably want to
talk and learn about.

194
00:22:41,631 --> 00:22:46,164
So I switched back to Paris.
- I'm not mad at you. OK?

195
00:22:46,298 --> 00:22:49,097
Do not need to explain to me.
It's not a big deal.

196
00:22:50,030 --> 00:22:55,097
Come on, Zoey, go to the coffee shop.

00:23:10,098 --> 00:23:13,630
I'm sorry, but sometimes excited

200
00:23:13,765 --> 00:23:15,964
when I see the American cowboy.

201
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:20,630
Good...

202
00:23:22,631 --> 00:23:27,097
's older than you. - Yes, a senior.
Is there something wrong with that?

203
00:23:27,431 --> 00:23:30,630
When I was growing up, if you...
- Hugh is a lot different than you.

204
00:23:31,298 --> 00:23:33,830
Look, I know that destroy, Zoey.
I...

205
00:23:34,277 --> 00:23:37,964

206
00:23:39,698 --> 00:23:42,029
Wow, this is for me?
- Yes.

207
00:23:44,165 --> 00:23:47,097
It's purple.
- Yes, your favorite color.

208
00:23:47,298 --> 00:23:50,764
Yes, when I was 10 years old.
I will go by subway with your friends.

209
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:53,630
We'll be home for dinner?

210
00:23:57,631 --> 00:24:01,097
Zoey, you'll be home for dinner?

211
00:24:47,631 --> 00:24:51,964
What is this? - Fresh. - Fresh? Only
the need to save money, right?

212
00:24:52,231 --> 00:24:54,031
Do not forget to dip it in milk.

213
00:24:55,631 --> 00:24:58,964
Milk?
- Only if you plan to fry...

214
00:25:00,831 --> 00:25:02,431
I have not got that far.

215
00:25:04,098 --> 00:25:06,464
Like
man who does not pretend to know

216
00:25:06,465 --> 00:25:10,907
how to be in the kitchen.
- You're talking to the right guy. - To...

217
00:25:13,298 --> 00:25:14,898

222
00:25:33,498 --> 00:25:35,130
You can call me Vivi.

223
00:25:35,131 --> 00:25:38,607
Fine I ran into you,
Vivi, but I'm not interested.

224
00:25:46,165 --> 00:25:47,765
Maybe we can talk.

225
00:25:54,898 --> 00:25:56,498
My wife gave me this.

226
00:26:00,898 --> 00:26:03,830
Come on, baby, take a ride.

227
00:26:07,831 --> 00:26:09,930
Good, but my bike

228
00:26:15,231 --> 00:26:16,982
The bike comes with me.

229
00:26:21,231 --> 00:26:25,698
Who exactly are you doing, Vivi?
- I work for the CIA director.

230
00:26:26,165 --> 00:26:27,765
I do not know one from the top.

231
00:26:27,921 --> 00:26:31,563
Serbia was my operation.
I asked Wolf.

232
00:26:32,774 --> 00:26:37,009
Believe that he was at this
day and I think you might have seen him.

233
00:26:37,010 --> 00:26:38,910
A minute.
- I'm ready to bet

234
00:26:38,965 --> 00:26:41,774
when you see him
you'll recognize it.

235
00:26:46,965 --> 00:26:52,029
I want to work for me.
- No way. I already have plans.

236
00:26:52,031 --> 00:26:54,530
Do not you think Zoey
deserves to have a father around

237
00:26:54,631 --> 00:26:56,764
more than a few measly months?

238
00:27:01,098 --> 00:27:03,230
Jesus! It was really close.

239
00:27:03,548 --> 00:27:05,400
In exchange for your cleaning services

240
00:27:05,401 --> 00:27:07,560
I can offer an experimental drug.

241
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:14,400
Are you interested?
This you can extend life, Ethan.

242
00:27:21,324 --> 00:27:24,830
For information about her?
You know, the results of the tests.

243
00:27:29,298 --> 00:27:31,430
How come no one is
told this before?

244
00:27:31,527 --> 00:27:33,830
'Cause you're not worth the cost of treatment.

245
00:27:33,831 --> 00:27:37,404
Wow, you make me feel so special.

246
00:27:37,574 --> 00:27:40,497
You were not. Now you have.
- Why?

247
00:27:41,698 --> 00:27:45,097
're Sick and dead
man with nothing to lose.

00:27:45,765 --> 00:27:48,648
I have access to many things, Ethan,

249
00:27:48,831 --> 00:27:50,697
But you just can not give access
wolf.

250
00:27:51,965 --> 00:27:55,630
I need you to find him and kill
.

251
00:28:00,098 --> 00:28:03,430
So back to redeem his life by killing for you?

252
00:28:03,631 --> 00:28:05,964
A man running inside the
Vuk accountant.

253
00:28:07,012 --> 00:28:08,979
You should start immediately.

254
00:28:11,765 --> 00:28:14,430
I need to fry fish and late.

255
00:28:14,615 --> 00:28:17,097
I can drop
home in time for dinner, Ethan.

256
00:28:18,631 --> 00:28:20,231
Question...

257
00:28:22,298 --> 00:28:24,430

258
00:28:35,030 --> 00:28:37,852

I told you to be a man, not

266
00:30:36,898 --> 00:30:40,230
But I told you to leave the life of a young man

00:31:04,765 --> 00:31:08,498
is a young man with a mustache.
- No, that's a goatee.

274
00:31:09,231 --> 00:31:11,297
These are just grown a mustache and hair.

275

00:31:40,098 --> 00:31:42,430
Goatee, it's your turn.

Do not get me wrong, Viv,
but not my type.

I look like I'm blown hair.
- Great.

315
00:35:04,231 --> 00:35:07,431
Really? - Yeah. - Do you think that this
hair can go to the prom?

316
00:35:07,433 --> 00:35:10,064
If you go,
could be brought.

317

00:35:19,859 --> 00:35:21,860
No, you can not...

'll be back to normal, right? Maybe...

323

You really think so? - Yeah.
What do you say to make dinner?

324
00:35:36,328 --> 00:35:40,394
Hey. No offers are getting ready to

Listen, I'm sorry, Tina.
But I was...

What's up with that I have just solved
great drama, her hair, right?

332
00:36:06,361 --> 00:36:10,328
I have to catch the first flight tomorrow
morning. Call the babysitter.

333
00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:16,060
I was late because I found
doctor who can help me.

334
00:36:16,909 --> 00:36:21,240
What? - Here in Paris

she has an experimental drug that is
ready to test on me.

336

Experiment?
What exactly does that mean?

337
00:36:32,861 --> 00:36:36,260
So I might be able to implement
a little more time with you and Zoey.

338
00:36:37,431 --> 00:36:40,864
You should have called, Ethan,
because I wanted to kill you.

339
00:36:45,061 --> 00:36:48,127
Can we stop
argue for a moment?

340
00:36:48,328 --> 00:36:51,794
Do not talk of whose murder.
Or mom.

341
00:36:52,461 --> 00:36:56,327
I would like us could
fry tuna.

342
00:36:56,795 --> 00:37:00,527
Tuna? - Yes.
- Tuna. - With all that live?

343
00:37:01,328 --> 00:37:02,928
No way!

344
00:37:07,661 --> 00:37:10,127
'll Fix that door, right?

345
00:37:12,211 --> 00:37:17,260
Yeah, that was a mistake.
- You're not here spent less than 24 hours.

346
00:37:19,728 --> 00:37:21,560
I hope this will be a comfortable couch.

347
00:37:23,261 --> 00:37:26,327
Better than the Polish
beds in Karachi.

348
00:37:31,328 --> 00:37:33,528
Do you need something
to help you fall asleep?

349
00:37:35,263 --> 00:37:37,260
Yes, it will take me far.

350
00:37:42,073 --> 00:37:43,673
're Terrible.

351
00:38:16,684 --> 00:38:18,380
I knew you'd call.

352
00:38:18,381 --> 00:38:21,181
What the hell did you give me?
- Will not stop?

353
00:38:21,234 --> 00:38:26,194
No. I feel dizzy, my head...
I feel dizzy.

354
00:38:27,461 --> 00:38:29,061
Vivi...

355
00:38:32,928 --> 00:38:36,327
Read the instructions.
- Stop! Hallucinating.

356
00:38:37,395 --> 00:38:40,727
Hallucinating.

00:39:40,328 --> 00:39:42,727

You can call me anytime.

362
00:39:49,228 --> 00:39:51,660
Only one hour
differences between Paris and London.

363
00:39:51,928 --> 00:39:56,763
Here. - You can also call me.
- I love you. - Good.

364
00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:01,060
I'll be back in two days late.
- Dad has a list. - A long list.

365
00:40:01,328 --> 00:40:04,503
Washing powder in black lingerie...
- See you, folks! Have fun!

366
00:40:04,861 --> 00:40:06,994
Zoey, come breakfast.

367
00:40:12,033 --> 00:40:17,444
Look at me. Come on. Only once,
up here. Just one.

368
00:40:22,128 --> 00:40:25,795
Good girl. Zoey!

369
00:40:34,438 --> 00:40:37,903
What is it?
- Wow, that's...

370
00:40:38,038 --> 00:40:41,504
What is it? - Jesus...
- So what, Ethan?

371
00:40:42,919 --> 00:40:44,604
This is red.

372
00:40:45,726 --> 00:40:49,792
Vivi? You'll let you?

373
00:40:50,126 --> 00:40:55,197
Sorry. Nobody important, just my boss
Vivi. - She called me in the middle of the night?

374
00:40:55,232 --> 00:40:59,058
We talk a lot, because we
international sale.

375
00:40:59,170 --> 00:41:00,791
Is always somewhere in the day.

376
00:41:01,659 --> 00:41:05,128
Well, now we have 3 days
for murder. - What are you doing?

377
00:41:06,126 --> 00:41:09,274
Name is ringing bells, Ethan.
I'll give you mine.

378
00:41:09,275 --> 00:41:11,710
Maybe we can talk more than once a year.

379
00:41:14,723 --> 00:41:18,192
There. Welcome to this century.

380
00:41:20,339 --> 00:41:22,925
Zoey. Zoey.

381
00:41:26,059 --> 00:41:27,991
Do not you want to ride a bike to school?

382
00:41:29,859 --> 00:41:34,525
Do you think Hugh
like my hair color? - Will. - Really? - Yes.

383
00:41:34,526 --> 00:41:37,926
Do you think he'll really like it?
- If he cares about you, he will.

384
00:41:38,192 --> 00:41:41,458
You do not like?
- No.

385
00:41:41,459 --> 00:41:45,858
No. I want to say that...
Zoey. I really like it.

386
00:41:46,836 --> 00:41:48,436
Great.

387
00:42:04,926 --> 00:42:09,458
I see you do not believe in the usual
gap of 48 hours between the murders.

388
00:42:09,659 --> 00:42:14,325
Length you have only three days.
- I will not get into your car, Vivi.

389
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:19,659
Not until I get a second opinion
in connection with what god you gave me.

390
00:42:20,091 --> 00:42:24,150
I told you it was kosher.
- No, it's not.

391
00:42:24,151 --> 00:42:27,058
The instructions say, you
the trouble to read it...

392
00:42:27,259 --> 00:42:29,525
If you can hold
low rhythm of the heart,

393
00:42:29,659 --> 00:42:31,650
shit
will act as a hallucinogen.

394
00:42:31,651 --> 00:42:33,688
Well Maintain a low rhythm of the heart.

395
00:42:33,792 --> 00:42:36,922
It's a little difficult given the job
that you made me do.

396
00:42:43,659 --> 00:42:45,259
Get  already in the car.

397
00:42:49,626 --> 00:42:51,581
I need you to locate an accountant Italians

398
00:42:51,676 --> 00:42:54,293
who arranges the book to his old friend
Albina.

399
00:42:56,515 --> 00:42:59,057
How to locate this guy?

400
00:42:59,135 --> 00:43:02,917
With the help of this man.
It's called Mitat Yilmaz.

401
00:43:02,952 --> 00:43:05,951
Rent limousines and serves them Albina.

402
00:43:08,839 --> 00:43:11,125
Meet him and
will take you right to the accountants.

403
00:43:11,159 --> 00:43:13,125
Good.

404
00:43:13,126 --> 00:43:17,725
I, Ethan? - Yes?
- Fuck the bike. Buy a suit.

405
00:43:18,926 --> 00:43:21,007
Why?
- Because I love my boys

406
00:43:21,008 --> 00:43:22,999
are better trained than those that kill.

407
00:43:30,859 --> 00:43:32,459
've Lost my horse, dear?

408
00:43:34,192 --> 00:43:36,191
Comes from "Brokeback Mountain."

409
00:43:38,192 --> 00:43:42,258
Realize that we rent
luxury cars, right? - Yeah.

410
00:43:42,592 --> 00:43:45,058
How did you hear about us?
- Albino said.

411
00:43:46,792 --> 00:43:50,125
Did you also told
that we offer discreet luxury?

412
00:43:50,526 --> 00:43:55,325
Told me not to talk to
servants, but to talk to the boss.

413
00:43:55,460 --> 00:43:58,713
We did not servants, right? We
executive vice-presidents of sales.

414
00:43:58,714 --> 00:44:00,767
He's crazy.

415
00:44:01,459 --> 00:44:03,059
You two feces.

416
00:44:05,059 --> 00:44:08,059
What does this mean?
- Shit. I think.

417
00:44:11,259 --> 00:44:12,859
Listen, asshole,

418
00:44:13,459 --> 00:44:17,058
a small piece of excrement,
for us're nothing.

419
00:44:17,326 --> 00:44:21,059
I'll never meet the boss.
Understand? - Well, I'm sorry. - Yes.

420
00:44:21,126 --> 00:44:24,858
I had a really weird night,
know, two weird night.

421
00:44:24,926 --> 00:44:30,071
Jet leg. I think we have a bad start.
I am guilty. - Yes.

422
00:44:30,526 --> 00:44:32,126
Let's start from the beginning?

423
00:44:59,059 --> 00:45:02,058
You are very rude man
to sit at my table

424
00:45:02,192 --> 00:45:06,755
and you are not invited, sir...?
- Why are names important now?

425
00:45:06,790 --> 00:45:08,854
'Cause I do not want to kill
complete stranger.

426
00:45:08,855 --> 00:45:11,068
Why do you want to kill me, Mitate?

427
00:45:13,459 --> 00:45:17,125
Sitting in my chair.
- I'm just waiting.

428
00:45:28,459 --> 00:45:33,458
Albino sent you? The bastard!
I have always been loyal. Please.

429
00:45:37,226 --> 00:45:40,361
Is this your daughter in the picture?
- How do you dare to watch?

430
00:45:40,362 --> 00:45:44,458
Seat. I also have
beautiful teenage daughter.

431
00:45:45,192 --> 00:45:47,258
Father to father,
Has your daughter ever...

432
00:45:47,859 --> 00:45:50,258
Are you your daughter
ever locked in a room?

433
00:45:50,592 --> 00:45:53,591
A haircut,
painted in red, you know...

434
00:45:54,192 --> 00:45:58,659
put wigs and shit?
- No. Never.

435
00:45:59,595 --> 00:46:02,325
Knew.
I'm in trouble.

436
00:46:06,326 --> 00:46:09,458
Albino did not send you to kill me?
- No.

437
00:46:12,911 --> 00:46:14,511
So, who are you?

438
00:46:16,762 --> 00:46:19,027
Ethan. Come on.

439
00:46:38,192 --> 00:46:40,392
I'll talk to this man in the bathroom.

440
00:46:40,452 --> 00:46:42,591
I do not want to be disturbed.

441
00:46:42,592 --> 00:46:45,858
Yes . Rule number two:
We do as you say.

442
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:50,858
Right. Rule number two.
- He's a bad guy? - Something like that.

443
00:46:51,059 --> 00:46:52,791
And you're a good guy?

444
00:46:59,726 --> 00:47:03,791
You are a professional? Why does
've never seen Paris?

445
00:47:03,926 --> 00:47:06,125
I was away on business,
five years.

446
00:47:06,192 --> 00:47:09,125
What is so important that he
daughter so long?

447
00:47:10,926 --> 00:47:15,458
I've never been good at keeping
balance between work and family.

448
00:47:20,223 --> 00:47:26,159
You know, when I go home, this life
murder, etc.... all that disappears.

449
00:47:28,926 --> 00:47:30,991
I brought the wrong decision when I left.

450
00:47:33,059 --> 00:47:35,058
Every day take their girls to school

451
00:47:35,459 --> 00:47:37,791
and dinner with my family.
This is the key.

452
00:47:38,259 --> 00:47:42,325
Good for you, Mitat.
Do not miss dinner tonight.

453
00:47:43,259 --> 00:47:47,058
When  accountant arrives in Paris?

454
00:47:50,059 --> 00:47:52,858
Please remind me, who is he?

455
00:48:05,059 --> 00:48:07,191
Halo?
- Hello, this is Mrs. Dryscal.

456
00:48:07,259 --> 00:48:09,458
I would like to talk with Zoeyinim father.

457
00:48:13,859 --> 00:48:15,725
I Zoeyin father.
Is she okay?

458
00:48:15,859 --> 00:48:18,058
Zoey is good, but we have to meet
.

459
00:48:18,059 --> 00:48:20,791
We need to talk about Zoeyinom behavior.

460
00:48:23,526 --> 00:48:25,791
I can get right now.
- Well, hurry up.

461
00:48:30,026 --> 00:48:31,658
Go to school.

462
00:48:31,659 --> 00:48:36,137
As I said Zoey,
studies have shown

463
00:48:36,172 --> 00:48:37,807
that aggression increases

464
00:48:37,808 --> 00:48:40,320
because of the violent display of popular culture.

465
00:48:40,459 --> 00:48:43,058
Zoeyina her mother
raised to be a pacifist.

466
00:48:44,059 --> 00:48:48,191
Hitting friends in person
hardly a passive response.

467
00:48:54,126 --> 00:48:56,525
Open hand or clenched fist?

468
00:48:58,192 --> 00:48:59,792
What's the difference?

469
00:49:00,187 --> 00:49:02,904
From my experience, anger, frustration
insults.

470
00:49:02,905 --> 00:49:04,707
All they require...

471
00:49:05,126 --> 00:49:07,458
All they require different responses.

472
00:49:08,926 --> 00:49:13,058
Mr. Renner,
is extremely important that you send your daughter

473
00:49:13,126 --> 00:49:17,694
clear message that no matter
with which one has to face in life

474
00:49:18,059 --> 00:49:20,925
violence is not an acceptable answer.

475
00:49:22,326 --> 00:49:23,926
I'll try.

476
00:49:29,092 --> 00:49:32,458
If it was not so weird,
it would be really embarrassing, Ethan.

477
00:49:32,526 --> 00:49:35,625
Let me see your hand. - What?
- Let me see your hand, Zoey.

478
00:49:37,926 --> 00:49:41,591
My thumb. - If you're going to hit someone
clenched fist,

479
00:49:41,592 --> 00:49:44,325
Take care not to bend the thumb
it.

480
00:49:45,283 --> 00:49:49,426
've Been gone for five years
and you tell me this.

481
00:49:53,123 --> 00:49:54,723
O God.

482
00:50:01,212 --> 00:50:04,011
You're a Muslim? - I do not.
I told you that this efičin car.

483
00:50:04,012 --> 00:50:06,011
Vivi is a Muslim?
- No.

484
00:50:07,259 --> 00:50:10,912
I'll put it on my phone.
This shit is terrible. - I know.

485
00:50:12,459 --> 00:50:14,258
I like that, who are they?

486
00:50:15,427 --> 00:50:17,726
Did not important at all
why I got in a fight?

487
00:50:20,059 --> 00:50:22,525
Why do not you just listen and try to understand
?

488
00:50:22,659 --> 00:50:24,658
Well, why do not you tell all
.

489
00:50:26,526 --> 00:50:28,658
I have a new friend from Pakistan

490
00:50:28,992 --> 00:50:32,125
i have one Briton
which he constantly called Paki.

491
00:50:32,159 --> 00:50:35,425
Today she put bacon in
boxes, so I hit her in the face.

492
00:50:35,659 --> 00:50:37,525
So, no longer do it, right?

493
00:50:40,459 --> 00:50:44,458
Just a minute, honey. Sounds like the
spare tire dumped in the trunk.

494
00:50:45,792 --> 00:50:47,392
Hey!

495
00:50:49,027 --> 00:50:51,258
I try to talk with her daughter.

496
00:50:55,326 --> 00:50:57,258
I'm sorry, honey.
Where were we?

497
00:50:57,892 --> 00:51:00,458
Hitting girls, right?
- I feel really bad.

498
00:51:00,459 --> 00:51:04,525
Do not  because it is sometimes the only way to stop
bad person.

499
00:51:05,259 --> 00:51:07,525
're Not mad at me?
- No, I'm not mad at you.

500
00:51:07,621 --> 00:51:09,956
I'm proud of you,
stood up for a friend.

501
00:51:10,781 --> 00:51:12,434
Whatever. I'll subway...

502
00:51:13,569 --> 00:51:15,169
I, Ethan...
- Yes?

503
00:51:15,326 --> 00:51:18,425
Maybe you should take something for that cough
. Really gets on my nerves.

504
00:51:20,916 --> 00:51:22,516

A better question, Zoey,
what did you do last night?

This is so embarrassing...
They will not let me over there.

592

01:06:34,557 --> 01:06:38,156
I have to catch the metro,

What the child does not know how to drive a bike?

611
01:07:25,375 --> 01:07:28,423
The kind of child who never
did not have a father to teach him.

612
01:07:35,424 --> 01:07:40,290
Damn. This is the straightest
place, let's try here.

613
01:07:40,424 --> 01:07:42,365
God, you had to buy the most?

614
01:07:42,424 --> 01:07:45,993
Not the greatest bike, Zoey,
it is a female bike.

615
01:07:46,216 --> 01:07:49,023
So, I chose him because
had a great tie. Is not it?

616
01:07:49,091 --> 01:07:52,823
No.
I can explain a great tie. I understand. You know...

617
01:07:53,224 --> 01:07:56,423
There are too many people.
Can we go to a lonely place?

618
01:07:56,424 --> 01:07:58,156
God.
- There are too many people.

619
01:07:59,824 --> 01:08:01,424
But purple is.

620
01:08:03,024 --> 01:08:08,223
Purple is. Climb. -
How to come up? - Just climb.

621
01:08:09,557 --> 01:08:12,823
Wow, we did it.
We're halfway there. Go.

622
01:08:13,557 --> 01:08:17,290
Give yourself time to
pushing away, okay? Below. OK?

623
01:08:17,624 --> 01:08:20,557
Zoey, it's okay. Are you okay?

624
01:08:21,891 --> 01:08:23,491
Right.
- Slowly, please.

625
01:08:23,691 --> 01:08:26,523
Well, I got you. Now alone...
know how to pedal.

626
01:08:26,624 --> 01:08:30,557
I'm here. - Very high.
Do not go. I'll...

627
01:08:36,091 --> 01:08:38,556
Why did you leave us, Ethan?

628
01:08:39,691 --> 01:08:41,291
Why did you leave me and my mom?

629
01:08:43,291 --> 01:08:48,424
I travel, baby,
and your mother and me... - What?

630
01:08:49,024 --> 01:08:50,823
There is no easy...

631
01:08:53,157 --> 01:08:54,823
There is no good answer, honey.

632
01:09:00,157 --> 01:09:02,890
Do you have a family?
- No, honey, I do not. Come on.

633
01:09:04,008 --> 01:09:06,050
Do you have another family?
Is that it? - I do not.

634
01:09:06,051 --> 01:09:08,446
Do you have another beautiful daughter
somewhere? - No, it's not...

635
01:09:08,491 --> 01:09:10,888
You saw me and did not want me?
- No, honey...

636
01:09:10,889 --> 01:09:13,087
Do not you love me?
-... It's not that.

637
01:09:17,424 --> 01:09:19,623
Why is it so
should go back?

638
01:09:21,024 --> 01:09:23,540
Look! - What was long gone,

639
01:09:23,541 --> 01:09:27,421
I tend to be back.

640
01:09:38,224 --> 01:09:40,423
Okay, okay, okay.

641
01:09:42,291 --> 01:09:45,223
That's all. No
nothing to do with you.

642
01:09:48,224 --> 01:09:52,462
Would you still cared about me
I was doing terrible things? - Of course.

643
01:09:53,882 --> 01:09:55,482
Sure.

644
01:09:55,795 --> 01:09:59,686
Full  lie.
All the time about everything.

645
01:09:59,691 --> 01:10:01,921
Even when I'm forced to.
I do not know why.

646
01:10:02,224 --> 01:10:07,023
Sometimes it's easier than telling the truth
.

647
01:10:07,291 --> 01:10:09,058
This girl I've gone to school

I do not like to be called that.
- I do not like it Hugh?

671
01:11:43,024 --> 01:11:48,156
I am in the sales department, honey.
It's my job to read people.

672
01:11:48,915 --> 01:11:51,823
You know, fathers

I suddenly became a single father.
Complicated.

681
01:12:28,957 --> 01:12:31,410

out of control

682
01:12:31,557 --> 01:12:33,757

My wife had to work late.
I have to pick up the daughter of a half 5

835
01:33:27,766 --> 01:33:29,965
You're a father who knows how things
.

836
01:34:45,343 --> 01:34:46,943
Watch out!

837
01:34:51,209 --> 01:34:52,809
's Okay.

838
01:34:59,343 --> 01:35:01,808
I've seen him this way.
Sick.

839
01:35:13,543 --> 01:35:15,143
What are you doing?

840
01:35:17,476 --> 01:35:19,076
Just kill him!

841
01:35:21,143 --> 01:35:22,743
Will not be long, dear.

842
01:35:31,609 --> 01:35:33,209
Kill him, damn it!

843
01:35:40,076 --> 01:35:41,676
Just kill him!

844
01:36:50,276 --> 01:36:51,876
Welcome back.

845
01:37:04,543 --> 01:37:06,808
Again you let your
Vuk slip away.

846
01:37:08,276 --> 01:37:11,809
Where am I?
- Safe...

847
01:37:15,009 --> 01:37:17,775
Today I got the results back from the lab
, Ethan.

848
01:37:17,809 --> 01:37:21,062
I was very curious.
And it turns out that...

849
01:37:21,209 --> 01:37:24,008
Seems to treat
has a positive effect on you.

850
01:37:26,085 --> 01:37:30,750
I do not want to spend the rest of life
killing for you, Vivi.

851
01:37:31,013 --> 01:37:32,630
're Almost finished the job, Ethan.

852
01:37:34,809 --> 01:37:36,409
Kill the Wolf.

853
01:37:39,343 --> 01:37:40,943
I'll need a new suit.

854
01:37:43,276 --> 01:37:44,876
Heard him.

855
01:37:52,076 --> 01:37:55,475
A change of plans.
We leave tonight.

856
01:37:56,076 --> 01:38:01,142
Take me home to my partner.
It will help me to leave Paris.

857
01:38:04,076 --> 01:38:07,675
Mama, do not destroy the night.
- Why do not you try this? - I will.

858
01:38:10,076 --> 01:38:12,542
Look, at least try them.
- I will not!

859
01:38:26,816 --> 01:38:29,717
Just smile and have fun.

860
01:38:29,809 --> 01:38:33,008
Why? I hate these shoes.
I look like Little Miss Sunshine.

861
01:38:39,809 --> 01:38:41,808
You look great, honey.
- No, not that.

862
01:38:51,730 --> 01:38:56,475
Zu. - Hugh.
- Look great. - Really?

863
01:38:56,609 --> 01:38:58,209
Yes, of course.

864
01:39:00,476 --> 01:39:04,408
Mr. Renner, Ms. Renner,
These are my parents.

865
01:39:04,543 --> 01:39:08,441
Glad to see you again.
Thank you for inviting us. - Not at all.

866
01:39:08,476 --> 01:39:12,608
This is Ethan, Zoyein father.
- Hi. And this is my partner.

867
01:39:17,110 --> 01:39:18,809
I'm so glad I met you.

868
01:39:21,343 --> 01:39:22,943
Yourself.

869
01:39:29,476 --> 01:39:31,076
How are you?

870
01:39:32,543 --> 01:39:34,143
Elated.

871
01:39:52,543 --> 01:39:54,608
Can I take your coat?
- Yes. - Thank you.

872
01:40:07,209 --> 01:40:10,718
Is not it great?
- Yes.

873
01:40:12,009 --> 01:40:13,609
Zoey, do me a favor.

874
01:40:14,955 --> 01:40:17,708
Use your best judgment in terms Hughua tonight.

875
01:40:27,621 --> 01:40:29,255
Cheers.

876
01:40:42,809 --> 01:40:44,409
Doing again!

877
01:40:46,143 --> 01:40:49,208
Yes. There's a problem here.

878
01:40:51,276 --> 01:40:53,275
Why you came back to Paris?

879
01:40:54,143 --> 01:40:57,142
No. I came back for you and Zoey.

880
01:40:57,809 --> 01:41:02,008
It was all a lie. You promised
keep their jobs away from us.

881
01:41:02,009 --> 01:41:04,408
Probably not even sick.
- It's not a lie, Tina.

882
01:41:05,076 --> 01:41:07,142
I do not have time to explain.

883
01:41:30,543 --> 01:41:32,808
The police will be here in 10 minutes.

884
01:41:34,543 --> 01:41:37,008
You used us both!
- I never would have done.

885
01:41:37,143 --> 01:41:38,875
Make sure the street is blocked.

886
01:41:40,209 --> 01:41:42,475
At least have the decency to look at me.

887
01:41:52,676 --> 01:41:54,276
Kill him.

888
01:41:55,809 --> 01:41:57,409
It's just bad luck.

889
01:42:08,288 --> 01:42:11,408
This is incredible.
- Yeah, I know. It's crazy.

890
01:42:21,343 --> 01:42:25,476
I'm sick.
- Come with me.

891
01:42:44,343 --> 01:42:48,275
Do not, please do not go. Come with me
home. - Please stay here.

892
01:43:02,409 --> 01:43:04,009
Zoey!
- Down!

893
01:43:35,543 --> 01:43:40,008
Can you hear me? I'll send you down.

894
01:44:37,609 --> 01:44:39,209
Dead.

895
01:44:52,343 --> 01:44:53,943
Shit.

896
01:45:11,543 --> 01:45:14,609
Do not.
- Never give up!

897
01:45:17,437 --> 01:45:19,037
It.

898
01:45:20,343 --> 01:45:21,943
I got it.

899
01:45:44,406 --> 01:45:46,008
O, my God.

900
01:45:48,009 --> 01:45:52,542
Am I in hell?
- So that resembles you, Ethan.

901
01:45:54,543 --> 01:45:56,143
I'm not surprised.

902
01:45:58,143 --> 01:46:00,075
Finish it.
- What?

903
01:46:02,543 --> 01:46:04,808
Jesus Christ.

904
01:46:12,218 --> 01:46:15,036
Promise. Are you really
stopped working for them?

905
01:46:15,606 --> 01:46:20,008
Ethan! - It was all a lie! - Ethan!
Promise me you'll never tell a lie.

906
01:46:20,209 --> 01:46:25,342
Have you really stopped working for them
? Promise me. - Stop it.

907
01:46:26,409 --> 01:46:28,009
I think not.

908
01:46:28,876 --> 01:46:32,475
My wife wants me to stop it.

909
01:47:07,276 --> 01:47:11,342
Can I talk to her? - No,
down on the beach, throwing stones.

910
01:47:11,490 --> 01:47:15,771
What? - A real break
each other now.

911
01:47:15,772 --> 01:47:18,175
At least I'm not firing stones.

912
01:47:18,209 --> 01:47:19,809
Is everything all right?

913
01:47:20,476 --> 01:47:24,008
Yes, it was good.
There were good days and bad days.

914
01:47:24,809 --> 01:47:27,408
She said some things,
I said some things.

915
01:47:27,569 --> 01:47:31,788
There were tears, but the week we spent
was really worth it.

916
01:48:04,957 --> 01:48:09,689
Hello. These are a
gifts from me and...

917
01:48:09,757 --> 01:48:12,089
package left at home.

918
01:48:12,157 --> 01:48:15,089
Hear that your car is still working.
Will you come back?

919
01:48:21,024 --> 01:48:22,624
I love you, Tina.

920
01:48:25,890 --> 01:48:29,289
If you can say one word

921
01:48:30,690 --> 01:48:33,089
you change your mind,
would you give me that chance?

922
01:48:36,157 --> 01:48:38,177
I have done a lot of mistakes in my life, Tina.

923
01:48:39,298 --> 01:48:41,341
I was a terrible husband. I was doing...

924
01:48:42,629 --> 01:48:47,651
I was doing things that can not be explained by
. I'll spend the rest of my life,

925
01:48:47,686 --> 01:48:50,356
no matter how much I have left,
by going to miss you.

926
01:48:52,090 --> 01:48:56,556
I just want to spend as much time
be with his daughter and wife.

927
01:49:00,737 --> 01:49:03,536
What is it?
- What?

928
01:49:03,537 --> 01:49:05,803
What would that word
made me change my mind?

929
01:49:07,804 --> 01:49:09,469
Christmas.

930
01:49:12,004 --> 01:49:16,337
These are the two words, Ethan.
- Hi, Mommy. - Hey, baby.

931
01:49:16,470 --> 01:49:18,070
I'm so glad you came!

932
01:49:21,137 --> 01:49:25,604
Come on, let's go inside. Tata
we will make hot chocolate.

933
01:49:30,337 --> 01:49:31,937
Go.

934
01:49:52,670 --> 01:49:54,270
Is Dad a tough guy?

935
01:49:58,337 --> 01:49:59,937
Worked some things.

936
01:50:05,804 --> 01:50:10,669
Do you think Dad will stay?
- How it can, honey.

937
01:50:13,004 --> 01:50:15,003
A lot of loves.

938
01:50:30,337 --> 01:50:33,536
Merry Christmas, baby!

1
00:00:23,261 --> 00:00:25,161
And they wonder why
those of us in our twenties...

2
00:00:25,361 --> 00:00:27,661
refuse to work
an 80-hour week...

3
00:00:27,861 --> 00:00:31,060
just so we can afford
to buy their BMWs...

4
00:00:31,095 --> 00:00:33,125
why we aren't interested...

5
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:35,660
in the counterculture
that they invented...

6
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:38,860
as if we did not see them
disembowel their revolution...

7
00:00:38,895 --> 00:00:41,327
for a pair
of running shoes.

8
00:00:41,362 --> 00:00:43,911
But the question remains...

9
00:00:43,946 --> 00:00:46,424
what are we going to do now?

10
00:00:46,459 --> 00:00:50,559
How can we repair all the damage
we inherited?

11
00:00:50,594 --> 00:00:54,559
Fellow graduates,
the answer is simple.

12
00:00:54,594 --> 00:00:55,959
The answer is...

13
00:01:07,058 --> 00:01:09,008
The answer is...

14
00:01:09,043 --> 00:01:10,958
I don't know.

15
00:01:20,657 --> 00:01:22,657
Good save, Lelaina.

16
00:01:23,757 --> 00:01:26,807
I'm not a valedictorian,
but I play one on TV.

17
00:01:26,842 --> 00:01:29,857
We all know you slept your way
to the podium.

18
00:01:35,956 --> 00:01:38,721
My favorite part about
graduating now would be...

19
00:01:38,756 --> 00:01:41,756
dodging my student-loan officer
for the rest of my life.

20
00:01:41,791 --> 00:01:43,221
He will be in cahoots...

21
00:01:43,256 --> 00:01:45,256
with the Columbia
Record and Tape Company guy...

22
00:01:45,291 --> 00:01:49,055
who's been after my ass
for years.

23
00:01:49,155 --> 00:01:51,755
Troy Dyer, I brought you back
a souvenir.

24
00:01:51,855 --> 00:01:52,755
Ah...

25
00:01:52,855 --> 00:01:55,755
You know, you can still go back
next year and graduate...

26
00:01:55,855 --> 00:01:57,255
still get your BFA.

27
00:01:57,355 --> 00:02:01,255
Oh, can I? And then I can hang
this on my rearview mirror...

28
00:02:01,355 --> 00:02:04,754
to brag to all my good buddies
back home that I graduated.

29
00:02:04,854 --> 00:02:07,454
Well, I through
with the whole life drama.

30
00:02:10,954 --> 00:02:13,154
Well, I know
this sounds cornball...

31
00:02:13,354 --> 00:02:18,653
but I'd like to somehow make
a difference in people's lives.

32
00:02:20,853 --> 00:02:24,253
And I... I would like
to buy them all a Coke.

33
00:02:25,253 --> 00:02:28,218
And you wonder
why we never got involved.

34
00:02:28,253 --> 00:02:30,753
Three words... November sixteenth
nineteen-ninety...

35
00:02:30,788 --> 00:02:32,570
Oh, totally drunk
and out of my mind!

36
00:02:32,605 --> 00:02:34,478
It would have been
a poetic experience...

37
00:02:34,513 --> 00:02:36,932
if I weren't such a gentleman,
which I am.

38
00:02:36,967 --> 00:02:39,352
Just let it go, Dyer.
Surrender the fantasy.

39
00:02:40,752 --> 00:02:43,352
Hey, Sammy,
what's your goal?

40
00:02:43,387 --> 00:02:45,052
My goal is to...

41
00:02:46,352 --> 00:02:48,852
Like a career or something.

42
00:02:56,351 --> 00:02:59,351
Lainie, I think the moment
has been appropriately captured.

43
00:02:59,386 --> 00:03:02,351
Would you please take your face
out of the camera?

44
00:03:02,386 --> 00:03:04,850
Come on.
It's for my documentary.

45
00:03:04,885 --> 00:03:06,250
Her...

46
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:09,650
Documentary.

47
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:14,550
Think fast.

48
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:21,349
Here's the deal.

49
00:03:21,449 --> 00:03:23,849
I'm going to take Sam
against his will...

50
00:03:23,949 --> 00:03:26,399
and straighten him out
because I truly believe...

51
00:03:26,434 --> 00:03:28,849
that if we can get two women
on the Supreme Court...

52
00:03:28,884 --> 00:03:31,149
we can get at least one
on you, Sam.

53
00:03:33,449 --> 00:03:35,449
I'm Superman.

54
00:03:36,448 --> 00:03:38,448
- I can fly.
- She's toast.

55
00:03:38,483 --> 00:03:39,413
Aah!

56
00:03:39,448 --> 00:03:41,848
Quick, Vickie.
What's your social security?

57
00:03:41,948 --> 00:03:45,848
Uh... 851-25-9357.

58
00:03:45,948 --> 00:03:47,748
Very impressive.

59
00:03:47,948 --> 00:03:50,748
It's the only thing
I really learned in college.

60
00:03:53,947 --> 00:03:58,012
Sometimes I get that
"not so fresh" feeling.

61
00:03:58,047 --> 00:04:01,947
Conjunction junction,
what's your function?

62
00:04:01,982 --> 00:04:05,914
Hooking up words
and phrases and clauses

63
00:04:05,949 --> 00:04:10,447
Conjunction junction,
how's that function?

64
00:04:10,482 --> 00:04:14,946
Got three favorite cars
that get most of my...

65
00:04:28,445 --> 00:04:31,945
Honey, honey. No, no, no.

66
00:04:40,844 --> 00:04:42,909
Is yours good?

67
00:04:42,944 --> 00:04:44,944
It doesn't seem fresh.

68
00:04:44,979 --> 00:04:46,744
I'm sorry.

69
00:04:51,444 --> 00:04:53,809
Well, I guess
it's about time...

70
00:04:53,844 --> 00:04:56,143
for me to give you
your graduation present, huh?

71
00:04:58,443 --> 00:04:59,908
Your... gas card.

72
00:04:59,943 --> 00:05:01,643
I'll pay that bill for one year.

73
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:04,943
And since Helen Anne's got
herself a brand-new Infinity...

74
00:05:05,043 --> 00:05:06,943
we're gonna give you
her old BMW.

75
00:05:07,043 --> 00:05:09,243
You can pick it up
at our house.

76
00:05:09,278 --> 00:05:13,507
- BMW? BMW?
- Yeah.

77
00:05:13,542 --> 00:05:16,542
Tom, didn't you listen
to her speech today?

78
00:05:16,577 --> 00:05:18,609
She didn't want a BMW.

79
00:05:18,644 --> 00:05:20,607
Mom, I'll handle this.

80
00:05:20,642 --> 00:05:22,107
I'm not gonna sit here
and listen again...

81
00:05:22,142 --> 00:05:24,642
to some strange ethical argument
about a damn car.

82
00:05:24,842 --> 00:05:26,591
Now, it's got four wheels.
It runs well.

83
00:05:26,626 --> 00:05:28,341
And, little darling,
after you've been...

84
00:05:28,376 --> 00:05:29,858
in the real world
for a while...

85
00:05:29,893 --> 00:05:31,306
you're gonna appreciate
that car.

86
00:05:31,341 --> 00:05:33,441
Yeah. Just think of all those
starving children in Africa...

87
00:05:33,641 --> 00:05:35,441
who don't even have cars.

88
00:05:35,641 --> 00:05:37,341
Troy, does your father
give you gifts like that?

89
00:05:37,376 --> 00:05:38,406
Mom.

90
00:05:38,441 --> 00:05:40,940
Well, actually, my father's
dying of prostate cancer...

91
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:43,540
so I don't really trouble him
much for gifts.

92
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,505
See, Tom.

93
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:52,390
You don't want a BMW.
Tell him, Lelaina.

94
00:05:52,425 --> 00:05:55,205
Charlane, she can
make up her own mind.

95
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:59,339
Dad, don't talk to her that way.
She's not a child.

96
00:05:59,539 --> 00:06:01,039
Well, she married one.

97
00:06:03,339 --> 00:06:04,339
What?

98
00:06:06,339 --> 00:06:09,339
All right. Excuse me.
Come on, come on.

99
00:06:09,374 --> 00:06:11,339
Mom, Dad, I'll take the BMW...

100
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:14,338
until I can afford to buy
a regular car myself, OK?

101
00:06:14,373 --> 00:06:16,255
OK, Mom?

102
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:18,103
Please?

103
00:06:18,138 --> 00:06:19,738
Mom, please, come on.

104
00:06:28,737 --> 00:06:31,437
Get a Ford.

105
00:06:59,735 --> 00:07:04,485
Just to float on the sea

106
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:09,235
Find myself on a page of history

107
00:07:10,735 --> 00:07:13,535
You know, as I ride along

108
00:07:13,735 --> 00:07:16,699
I can always hear the song

109
00:07:16,734 --> 00:07:22,234
about you
and where you're meant to be

110
00:07:23,734 --> 00:07:27,184
Well, you're gonna
tell me the answers

111
00:07:27,219 --> 00:07:30,633
I'll know when you
come back to me

112
00:07:42,133 --> 00:07:48,532
If we should fall,
love will catch us every time

113
00:07:48,632 --> 00:07:52,232
I hear you call, I will run

114
00:07:53,732 --> 00:07:59,432
And if the magic
of the adventure overcomes

115
00:07:59,467 --> 00:08:04,231
We won't cry,
because it could be fun

116
00:08:06,531 --> 00:08:10,531
Well, I'm gonna
tell you the answers

117
00:08:10,566 --> 00:08:14,531
You'll know when you
come back to me

118
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:35,594
Gonna be all right

119
00:08:35,629 --> 00:08:38,229
When you come back to me

120
00:09:19,527 --> 00:09:23,326
Good morning!

121
00:09:23,361 --> 00:09:25,691
Ha ha ha ha!

122
00:09:25,726 --> 00:09:28,326
Yes. Good morning,
ladies and... gentleman!

123
00:09:28,361 --> 00:09:30,726
I see a gentleman
right over there!

124
00:09:30,761 --> 00:09:32,791
Good morning!

125
00:09:32,826 --> 00:09:34,791
Good morning!
Boy, I tell you...

126
00:09:34,826 --> 00:09:37,575
it is a good morning
with this audience.

127
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:40,217
Ha! Well, today,
for all you dieters...

128
00:09:40,252 --> 00:09:42,825
guiltless goodies
from chef Skinny Ninny.

129
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:45,790
Whoa. Mmm!

130
00:09:45,825 --> 00:09:47,790
And we'll also be visiting
with a man...

131
00:09:47,825 --> 00:09:51,224
right here from Houston
who is battling Alzheimer's.

132
00:09:53,024 --> 00:09:55,624
A beautiful
and touching story...

133
00:09:55,659 --> 00:09:58,189
of the triumph
of the human spirit.

134
00:09:58,224 --> 00:10:01,224
He's so cheesy, I can't
watch him without crackers.

135
00:10:01,424 --> 00:10:03,524
Now let's take a peek
inside our "Video View"...

136
00:10:03,724 --> 00:10:07,123
and see what we have
in store for today.

137
00:10:09,323 --> 00:10:10,688
It's a special report

138
00:10:10,723 --> 00:10:14,023
on children's
birthday party themes...

139
00:10:14,058 --> 00:10:15,488
taped on location...

140
00:10:15,523 --> 00:10:17,588
at 8-year-old
Davy Robbins' party...

141
00:10:17,623 --> 00:10:21,423
exclusively for our
"Video View" collection.

142
00:10:21,458 --> 00:10:23,787
Ha ha ha!

143
00:10:23,822 --> 00:10:27,322
So... come sit with me.

144
00:10:27,522 --> 00:10:30,922
Relax.
Have a cup of joe.

145
00:10:31,922 --> 00:10:34,622
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

146
00:10:35,922 --> 00:10:40,121
Well, anyway, it's gonna be
a good day. Good morning!

147
00:10:42,021 --> 00:10:43,621
You're beautiful.

148
00:10:48,821 --> 00:10:50,521
We're clear.

149
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:55,420
Am I here to amuse you,
Miss Pierce?

150
00:10:55,455 --> 00:10:56,985
Am I here to make you laugh?

151
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:58,520
Is that the real reason
I'm on this show?

152
00:10:58,555 --> 00:10:59,987
Mr. Gubler, when I prepare
your note cards...

153
00:11:00,022 --> 00:11:01,521
you're supposed to get
your own espresso.

154
00:11:01,556 --> 00:11:02,988
Didn't you get
my "espress yourself" memo?

155
00:11:03,023 --> 00:11:04,420
I don't have time
for your little mind games.

156
00:11:04,455 --> 00:11:05,985
I'd like to remind you...

157
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:07,985
that we're laying people
off around here.

158
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:11,019
I can find an intern who will do
your job for free like that.

159
00:11:19,919 --> 00:11:22,219
I been locked out

160
00:11:22,254 --> 00:11:24,484
I been locked in

161
00:11:24,519 --> 00:11:28,483
But I always seem
to come back again

162
00:11:28,518 --> 00:11:31,683
And the view, when I look
from my window...

163
00:11:31,718 --> 00:11:33,918
Oh, that's a much better size.
That looks great.

164
00:11:34,018 --> 00:11:37,018
That would go really well
with the EZ-Fits.

165
00:11:37,053 --> 00:11:40,018
So... Oh, buttoning it up.
That's even better.

166
00:11:43,117 --> 00:11:45,117
Yeah, roll 'em right up.

167
00:11:45,152 --> 00:11:47,117
It's liberating, isn't it?

168
00:11:51,117 --> 00:11:54,017
I bought
a toothbrush, some toothpaste

169
00:11:54,117 --> 00:11:56,416
A flannel for my face

170
00:11:56,516 --> 00:11:59,016
Pajamas, a hairbrush

171
00:11:59,116 --> 00:12:01,316
new shoes, and a case

172
00:12:01,351 --> 00:12:04,483
I said to my reflection

173
00:12:04,518 --> 00:12:07,616
Let's get out of this place

174
00:12:08,716 --> 00:12:11,516
Past the church and the steeple

175
00:12:11,615 --> 00:12:13,515
The laundry on the hill

176
00:12:14,615 --> 00:12:17,715
Murder, there's one committed
each 7 seconds.

177
00:12:19,015 --> 00:12:22,715
Hello. I got cut off.
I'm sorry.

178
00:12:22,815 --> 00:12:26,615
Tempted by the fruit of another

179
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:27,514
Waa waa

180
00:12:29,614 --> 00:12:30,914
Hello? What?

181
00:12:31,014 --> 00:12:34,514
Tempted, but the truth
is discovered

182
00:12:39,114 --> 00:12:41,714
No, no, no.
Listen, he needs us, OK?

183
00:12:41,749 --> 00:12:44,313
If he makes videos,
we show them, OK?

184
00:12:44,413 --> 00:12:47,213
It's symbiotic. It's like
a "chicken or the egg?"

185
00:12:47,248 --> 00:12:49,913
It's both of them
working together.

186
00:12:50,013 --> 00:12:53,013
Yeah, uh-huh.
Well, let me tell you something.

187
00:12:53,113 --> 00:12:55,413
No, no, no.
I'm not scared of...

188
00:12:55,513 --> 00:12:56,963
Jesus!

189
00:12:56,998 --> 00:12:58,413
Aah!

190
00:12:58,512 --> 00:13:00,412
Michael, don't laugh at me.

191
00:13:00,512 --> 00:13:01,412
What?

192
00:13:01,512 --> 00:13:05,112
No, I'm in an accident.
I got in an accident.

193
00:13:05,147 --> 00:13:06,612
Yeah, I'm fine.

194
00:13:06,712 --> 00:13:08,412
No. I'll call you back,
all right?

195
00:13:08,512 --> 00:13:09,777
I'm gonna call you...

196
00:13:09,812 --> 00:13:11,712
When you said
you would sue...

197
00:13:11,747 --> 00:13:13,577
Well, it's not
really my idea.

198
00:13:13,612 --> 00:13:16,011
It's just I got my lawyer guy
telling me, you know...

199
00:13:16,046 --> 00:13:17,976
something, like,
about my rates or...

200
00:13:18,011 --> 00:13:21,811
Right. You mean, like sue
in a courtroom for money?

201
00:13:21,911 --> 00:13:23,011
I don't even know...

202
00:13:23,111 --> 00:13:24,611
because I've never really
done anything like this before.

203
00:13:24,711 --> 00:13:25,811
I mean, do you have
a lawyer or something?

204
00:13:25,911 --> 00:13:29,011
No, I don't have a lawyer.
I don't have a dentist.

205
00:13:29,111 --> 00:13:31,610
I'm... You know, I make
four-hundred dollars a week.

206
00:13:31,645 --> 00:13:33,375
What do you do?

207
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:36,110
Well, at the moment,
I'm working...

208
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:38,810
I'm sorry.
I just... I got to...

209
00:13:41,210 --> 00:13:42,310
Hello.

210
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:45,275
Yeah. What is it?

211
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:46,874
You know, I don't care...

212
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:49,109
if she does twelve books
of herself naked, OK?

213
00:13:49,209 --> 00:13:50,274
It doesn't...

214
00:13:50,309 --> 00:13:52,309
That's Dr. Zaius
from "Planet of the Apes. "

215
00:13:52,344 --> 00:13:53,809
Oh.

216
00:13:54,009 --> 00:13:55,509
I'm sorry. No.
Someone else is in here.

217
00:13:55,544 --> 00:13:57,309
Yeah? Well, let her
say that to me.

218
00:13:58,609 --> 00:14:01,208
- No, don't do that.
- Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

219
00:14:01,243 --> 00:14:02,925
No, no. You can...
That's all right...

220
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,608
I was... Go ahead.
You want to touch it?

221
00:14:04,643 --> 00:14:05,808
It's all right.
Yeah. No, go ahead.

222
00:14:05,843 --> 00:14:07,673
No, I was talking to...

223
00:14:07,708 --> 00:14:11,508
Look, can I talk to you later?
Can we... When? OK. OK.

224
00:14:11,543 --> 00:14:14,708
Um... OK.

225
00:14:14,808 --> 00:14:16,108
Um... uh...

226
00:14:17,407 --> 00:14:20,572
You know what?
Just forget it.

227
00:14:20,607 --> 00:14:22,407
Really, just forget
the whole thing...

228
00:14:22,442 --> 00:14:24,172
because it was probably
my fault anyway.

229
00:14:24,207 --> 00:14:26,707
And I'll get in trouble,
and it just doesn't...

230
00:14:26,742 --> 00:14:28,672
And you seem very sweet.

231
00:14:28,707 --> 00:14:30,807
And you seem to like Dr. Zaius.

232
00:14:30,907 --> 00:14:32,306
Oh. Ha ha.

233
00:14:33,606 --> 00:14:35,506
- Oh, no.
- That's...

234
00:14:37,206 --> 00:14:38,371
I'm sorry.

235
00:14:38,406 --> 00:14:41,506
That's... He was just
a collector's... No big...

236
00:14:41,541 --> 00:14:42,871
Well, we can...

237
00:14:42,906 --> 00:14:44,571
- You know what?
- No, here's his head.

238
00:14:44,606 --> 00:14:48,305
It's really... you know...
I think he's gone.

239
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:51,405
I'm, like, ruining
your whole life here.

240
00:14:51,505 --> 00:14:53,670
No, no, you're not. Really.

241
00:14:53,705 --> 00:14:55,905
Just don't... Just don't
touch anything else...

242
00:14:56,005 --> 00:14:57,805
and I think we'll be fine.

243
00:14:59,405 --> 00:15:02,405
Michael Grates, vice president
regional programming...

244
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,421
"In Your Face" TV.
We've seen it.

245
00:15:04,456 --> 00:15:06,369
It's like MTV,
but with an edge.

246
00:15:06,404 --> 00:15:08,804
- Yeah. So, is it a date?
- Yeah, yeah.

247
00:15:08,839 --> 00:15:10,704
- Dinner?
- Coffee.

248
00:15:10,804 --> 00:15:13,704
- Coffee or cappuccino?
- He ended up saying decaf.

249
00:15:13,804 --> 00:15:16,704
Oh, no. Early night.
Is there any precoffee activity?

250
00:15:16,804 --> 00:15:18,104
Um... I don't think so.

251
00:15:18,204 --> 00:15:20,703
Did he ask you to go out
or to hang out?

252
00:15:20,803 --> 00:15:22,103
Go out.
He definitely said go out.

253
00:15:22,203 --> 00:15:23,903
Hey.
How are you doing?

254
00:15:23,938 --> 00:15:26,068
- Oh, shit.
- What?

255
00:15:26,103 --> 00:15:28,503
I forgot to tell you something.

256
00:15:28,538 --> 00:15:30,468
Are you out of your mind?

257
00:15:30,503 --> 00:15:32,803
Oh, my god. Lainie, he just got
fired from the newsstand.

258
00:15:32,838 --> 00:15:35,102
He needs a place to stay
till he can find a new job...

259
00:15:35,137 --> 00:15:36,602
and get his own place.

260
00:15:36,702 --> 00:15:38,702
Vickie, that's the American
dream of the nineties.

261
00:15:38,737 --> 00:15:40,267
That could take years.

262
00:15:40,302 --> 00:15:42,302
Look at it like a built-in
security system.

263
00:15:42,337 --> 00:15:43,667
We'll have a man
around the house.

264
00:15:43,702 --> 00:15:46,202
We'll have a hall monitor.
That's what we'll have.

265
00:15:46,237 --> 00:15:48,702
I don't even know if this is
allowed in the building.

266
00:15:48,737 --> 00:15:51,301
It's not like Mr. Roper's
gonna burst in.

267
00:15:51,336 --> 00:15:53,266
I'll just stay on the couch.

268
00:15:53,301 --> 00:15:56,301
Vickie,
he will turn this place...

269
00:15:56,336 --> 00:15:59,101
into a den of slack.

270
00:16:00,201 --> 00:16:01,701
What the hell is your problem?

271
00:16:03,201 --> 00:16:06,200
I have to work around here,
and unfortunately, Troy...

272
00:16:06,235 --> 00:16:09,065
you are a master
at the art of time suckage.

273
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:11,200
Oh, well, I'm sorry, miss poster
girl for the workers party...

274
00:16:11,235 --> 00:16:13,800
but until I get that toehold
in the burger industry...

275
00:16:13,835 --> 00:16:15,165
I got a little time to suck.

276
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:18,200
I'd rather check into a shelter
than deal with her shit.

277
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:21,000
I know how much you
love to mainline in misery here.

278
00:16:21,035 --> 00:16:22,164
But you don't have to.

279
00:16:22,199 --> 00:16:26,199
I can get you a job interview
at my dad's plant.

280
00:16:26,234 --> 00:16:28,099
What is that?
Part of my lease agreement?

281
00:16:28,199 --> 00:16:30,499
It's either that
or a credit check.

282
00:16:30,599 --> 00:16:32,599
It's cool, Troy.
You can stay.

283
00:16:32,634 --> 00:16:33,964
Welcome to the maxi pad.

284
00:16:33,999 --> 00:16:35,964
Yeah,
with the new dry-weave...

285
00:16:35,999 --> 00:16:39,798
it actually pulls moisture
away from you. It's good.

286
00:16:41,498 --> 00:16:43,298
You won't even know
I'm here.

287
00:16:45,698 --> 00:16:47,098
Should I get married?
Should I be good?

288
00:16:47,198 --> 00:16:48,598
Should I astound
the girl next door

289
00:16:48,698 --> 00:16:50,648
with my velvet suit
and my Faustus hood?

290
00:16:50,683 --> 00:16:52,563
And not take her to movies
but to cemeteries

291
00:16:52,598 --> 00:16:55,597
and tell her of werewolf tongues
and forked clarinets?

292
00:16:57,097 --> 00:16:58,597
What
"Hey, That's My Bike"...

293
00:16:58,697 --> 00:17:01,097
would like to do eventually.
as a band...

294
00:17:01,197 --> 00:17:03,397
is travel the countryside
like Woody Guthrie.

295
00:17:03,432 --> 00:17:05,262
Or Richard Simmons.

296
00:17:05,297 --> 00:17:07,097
You know how,
in his commercials...

297
00:17:07,197 --> 00:17:09,896
how he travels around,
surprises people jogging.

298
00:17:09,996 --> 00:17:13,596
As you can see,
I have the occasional run-in...

299
00:17:13,696 --> 00:17:16,946
with an anti-
"Hey, That's My Biker. "

300
00:17:16,981 --> 00:17:20,196
And to those people,
I say nobody...

301
00:17:21,196 --> 00:17:24,295
Nobody can eat fifty eggs.

302
00:17:24,495 --> 00:17:26,760
- Lainie?
- Whatie?

303
00:17:26,795 --> 00:17:29,695
The next time you make
microwave brownies...

304
00:17:29,730 --> 00:17:32,595
I'd really consider
using a microwave.

305
00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:34,960
It's just a thought.

306
00:17:34,995 --> 00:17:36,995
You know,
I finally figured out...

307
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:38,862
what your problem is, Dyer.

308
00:17:38,897 --> 00:17:40,659
What's that?
I'm not a Pepper?

309
00:17:40,694 --> 00:17:43,194
You suffer from the philosopher
groupie syndrome.

310
00:17:43,229 --> 00:17:46,659
You're this guy
with, like, a 180 I.Q...

311
00:17:46,694 --> 00:17:49,194
ten units away from
a degree in philosophy...

312
00:17:49,394 --> 00:17:52,394
and you always fall
for these dumb groupie types.

313
00:17:52,429 --> 00:17:54,159
Now... they are not all dumb.

314
00:17:54,194 --> 00:17:57,158
Most of them
are just very, very depressed.

315
00:17:57,193 --> 00:18:00,193
Do you find me attractive,
sitting here, eating brownies?

316
00:18:00,228 --> 00:18:02,193
You do. You're strangely
attracted to me right now.

317
00:18:02,228 --> 00:18:04,158
You're oddly, oddly
attracted to me.

318
00:18:04,193 --> 00:18:06,193
It turns you on, doesn't it?
You like to watch, don't you?

319
00:18:06,228 --> 00:18:09,193
Come on.
Come on! Aah!

320
00:18:09,228 --> 00:18:10,658
Here. Ha ha ha!

321
00:18:10,693 --> 00:18:13,192
Don't! Come on.
It's not funny. Give it back.

322
00:18:13,227 --> 00:18:14,557
- Give what back?
- Give it back!

323
00:18:14,592 --> 00:18:16,592
Give what back?
Give the brownies back?

324
00:18:16,627 --> 00:18:19,057
- Aah!
- Brownies, brownies.

325
00:18:19,092 --> 00:18:21,092
Oh, I love brownies.
My name's Lelaina.

326
00:18:21,127 --> 00:18:22,792
Hey, don't!
Hey, watch the camera.

327
00:18:22,892 --> 00:18:25,392
Don't throw it at me.
That's not nice.

328
00:18:34,691 --> 00:18:37,191
Mr. Gubler, do you have time
to take a look...

329
00:18:37,291 --> 00:18:38,691
at what I've done here?

330
00:18:38,791 --> 00:18:40,691
I need my questions.

331
00:18:40,791 --> 00:18:43,190
Oh, well, here's
the research that I did.

332
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:44,690
You might want to read it...

333
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:47,390
because this guest has
quite a history in politics.

334
00:18:47,425 --> 00:18:49,290
Just give me my questions.

335
00:18:59,789 --> 00:19:01,389
Excusez-moi.

336
00:19:02,789 --> 00:19:05,289
- You all alone?
- Not anymore.

337
00:19:05,389 --> 00:19:07,889
If I could bottle
the sexual tension...

338
00:19:07,989 --> 00:19:10,789
between Bonnie Franklin
and Schneider...

339
00:19:10,824 --> 00:19:13,688
I could solve
the energy crisis.

340
00:19:13,723 --> 00:19:15,353
Excuse me.

341
00:19:15,388 --> 00:19:19,653
Don't bogart that can... man.

342
00:19:19,688 --> 00:19:22,788
- Are you retarded?
- No. I'm rhyming.

343
00:19:23,988 --> 00:19:27,088
It's not easy.
Sure, I make it look easy.

344
00:19:29,287 --> 00:19:30,987
You guys
better not be inhaling.

345
00:19:31,087 --> 00:19:32,252
Hi.

346
00:19:32,287 --> 00:19:37,487
Lelaina, Vickie was just
promoted to manager of the Gap.

347
00:19:37,587 --> 00:19:40,087
- Shut up.
- It's not even a big deal.

348
00:19:40,122 --> 00:19:42,504
The old manager
tried to kill herself...

349
00:19:42,539 --> 00:19:44,613
by eating a whole pot
of poinsettias.

350
00:19:44,648 --> 00:19:46,651
Still, I'm so proud of you.
Wait.

351
00:19:46,686 --> 00:19:49,736
I'll be making four-hundred
dollars a week, though.

352
00:19:49,771 --> 00:19:52,786
We're never gonna
have rent problems again.

353
00:19:52,821 --> 00:19:54,751
Troy, aren't you excited?

354
00:19:54,786 --> 00:19:57,586
I'm bursting with fruit flavor.

355
00:19:57,686 --> 00:19:59,586
You guys,
I just thought of something.

356
00:19:59,686 --> 00:20:01,785
I'm manager of the Gap.

357
00:20:01,885 --> 00:20:05,285
I'm responsible
for all those t-shirts...

358
00:20:05,385 --> 00:20:09,185
French-cut, v-necked, ribbed,
what have you.

359
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:10,450
Dude, I'm in trouble.

360
00:20:10,485 --> 00:20:12,450
No, you're not, Vick.
I know you can do it.

361
00:20:12,485 --> 00:20:15,785
I just do not understand
why this moment...

362
00:20:15,885 --> 00:20:17,249
has to be Memorexed.

363
00:20:17,284 --> 00:20:18,949
Sammy, don't you realize?

364
00:20:18,984 --> 00:20:22,784
This is your one opportunity
to play a small part...

365
00:20:22,884 --> 00:20:25,284
in what is destined
to be greatness.

366
00:20:25,384 --> 00:20:27,984
Lainie here
is gonna revolutionize...

367
00:20:28,019 --> 00:20:29,284
"Good Morning, Grant. "

368
00:20:29,384 --> 00:20:32,783
Oh, my god! I'm so sorry!
I had no idea!

369
00:20:32,883 --> 00:20:35,283
Look who's mocking.
All you do around here, Troy...

370
00:20:35,383 --> 00:20:38,683
is eat and couch
and fondle the remote control.

371
00:20:38,883 --> 00:20:41,683
I am not under any orders to
make the world a better place.

372
00:20:41,718 --> 00:20:43,600
Well, then what good are you?

373
00:20:43,635 --> 00:20:45,483
You're a pathological optimist.

374
00:20:45,583 --> 00:20:46,948
You're pathological.

375
00:20:46,983 --> 00:20:49,882
Oh, would you two just do it
and get it over with?

376
00:20:49,917 --> 00:20:51,382
I'm starving.

377
00:20:55,282 --> 00:20:56,847
Oh!

378
00:20:56,882 --> 00:20:59,782
Hello. You've reached
the winter of our discontent.

379
00:21:01,182 --> 00:21:03,881
Uh... hold on.
It's some Michael character.

380
00:21:03,916 --> 00:21:05,381
Oh.

381
00:21:07,381 --> 00:21:09,846
- Who's Michael?
- Let's order a pizza.

382
00:21:09,881 --> 00:21:12,881
Lelaina, if we promise
to pay you back...

383
00:21:12,916 --> 00:21:14,381
will you spot us a pizza?

384
00:21:14,416 --> 00:21:15,846
Don't have any cash.

385
00:21:15,881 --> 00:21:17,381
Dominoes takes checks.

386
00:21:17,416 --> 00:21:18,580
OK, great.

387
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,180
OK. Bye.

388
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:23,980
The owner of Dominoes
supports Operation Rescue.

389
00:21:24,015 --> 00:21:26,380
Oh, please. No one
gives a shit right now.

390
00:21:26,415 --> 00:21:28,447
We're starving.

391
00:21:28,482 --> 00:21:30,480
Oh, wait. Wait.

392
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:36,279
- Ta-da!
- We're going to eat gas.

393
00:21:39,779 --> 00:21:41,344
Ah!

394
00:21:41,379 --> 00:21:43,379
Who's this Michael guy?

395
00:21:43,479 --> 00:21:44,544
Um...

396
00:21:44,579 --> 00:21:46,879
Hey. Vickie just figured
something out.

397
00:21:46,979 --> 00:21:48,879
- What?
- Something wonderful.

398
00:21:48,979 --> 00:21:53,378
Ha ha ha! Evian is naive
spelled backwards.

399
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:56,178
Uh! Could you
turn this up, please?

400
00:21:56,278 --> 00:21:58,878
Please?
You won't be sorry.

401
00:21:59,978 --> 00:22:01,378
Thank you.

402
00:22:01,478 --> 00:22:05,477
...When you gonna give me
some time, Sharona?

403
00:22:05,512 --> 00:22:08,994
Ooh, you make my motor run,
my motor run

404
00:22:09,029 --> 00:22:12,442
Gun it comin' off
of the line, Sharona

405
00:22:12,477 --> 00:22:15,777
Never gonna stop, give it up,
such a dirty mind

406
00:22:15,812 --> 00:22:19,077
Always get it up for the touch
of the younger kind

407
00:22:19,177 --> 00:22:21,976
My, my, my, i, yi, woo!

408
00:22:22,011 --> 00:22:23,576
Hey!

409
00:22:23,676 --> 00:22:25,376
M- m-my Sharona.

410
00:22:28,476 --> 00:22:31,676
Come a little closer, huh?
Ah, will ya, huh?

411
00:22:31,711 --> 00:22:34,876
Close enough to look
in my eyes, Sharona

412
00:22:34,911 --> 00:22:38,440
Keeping it a mystery,
it gets to me

413
00:22:38,475 --> 00:22:41,875
Running down the length
of my thighs, Sharona...

414
00:22:42,375 --> 00:22:45,675
Good times,
any time you need them, baby

415
00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:48,940
Good times,
ain't no time to be afraid

416
00:22:48,975 --> 00:22:50,975
Thelma's husband Keith has got
vodka hidden in the toilet.

417
00:22:51,010 --> 00:22:53,274
Vodka in the toilet.
That's a good one.

418
00:22:53,374 --> 00:22:54,924
Um... boom boom.

419
00:22:54,959 --> 00:22:56,439
James Dice.

420
00:22:56,474 --> 00:22:57,974
That's a two-parter, man.
You can't do that.

421
00:22:58,009 --> 00:22:59,939
J.J. works in the chicken shop.

422
00:22:59,974 --> 00:23:01,974
He works in a chicken shop.
We did that.

423
00:23:02,009 --> 00:23:03,974
It's the same one
when he has that cape on.

424
00:23:04,009 --> 00:23:05,439
Drink up, man.

425
00:23:05,474 --> 00:23:07,973
You hate to see that
happen to the rookie.

426
00:23:08,008 --> 00:23:09,473
Um... Alderman Davis
judges a...

427
00:23:11,473 --> 00:23:12,873
Oh, my god.

428
00:23:12,908 --> 00:23:14,273
Hi.

429
00:23:14,373 --> 00:23:16,773
Are you a collection agent?

430
00:23:16,808 --> 00:23:18,838
Lelaina!

431
00:23:18,873 --> 00:23:22,773
Oh! Yeah, I'll be right there.

432
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:28,037
Oh.

433
00:23:28,072 --> 00:23:30,872
If you ain't
the most hardheaded woman...

434
00:23:30,907 --> 00:23:32,272
Great!

435
00:23:32,372 --> 00:23:33,772
Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up.
Oh, it's me!

436
00:23:33,872 --> 00:23:35,272
Willona dates a deaf guy.

437
00:23:35,372 --> 00:23:36,737
- Good one.
- Willona dates a deaf guy.

438
00:23:36,772 --> 00:23:39,321
How about the one
when Gary Coleman comes on...

439
00:23:39,356 --> 00:23:41,871
and he's like the little...
like, guy doing that...

440
00:23:42,971 --> 00:23:45,171
- Yeah, we did that one.
- He was cute, though.

441
00:23:45,206 --> 00:23:47,471
- J.J.'s prom date.
- Gotta go. Gotta go.

442
00:23:47,506 --> 00:23:49,036
- Hey. Hi. Hello. Hi.
- Hi.

443
00:23:49,071 --> 00:23:53,371
Um... everybody, this is Michael.
This is...

444
00:23:54,371 --> 00:23:56,870
Prom date. Prom date. Go.

445
00:23:56,970 --> 00:23:58,370
You know, we should...
We should... Yeah.

446
00:23:58,470 --> 00:23:59,570
So, I'm gonna go.

447
00:23:59,670 --> 00:24:00,635
Bye.

448
00:24:00,670 --> 00:24:02,135
Michael throws a party.
Sammy, let's go.

449
00:24:02,170 --> 00:24:05,770
Lelaina, you know the punishment
for premature evacuation.

450
00:24:09,070 --> 00:24:12,469
Penny! Willona adopts Penny!
Shit!

451
00:24:14,369 --> 00:24:16,669
I'm making
this documentary...

452
00:24:16,769 --> 00:24:18,469
about my friends,
but it's really about...

453
00:24:18,569 --> 00:24:21,134
people who are trying to find
their own identity...

454
00:24:21,169 --> 00:24:24,769
without having any real role
models or heroes or anything.

455
00:24:24,804 --> 00:24:28,333
Wow. That...
That sounds great.

456
00:24:28,368 --> 00:24:30,868
It seems like your friends
would be perfect for that.

457
00:24:30,903 --> 00:24:32,635
Like, um...
Like that guy Troy...

458
00:24:32,670 --> 00:24:34,368
- Troy, yeah.
- You all done here, sir?

459
00:24:34,403 --> 00:24:35,833
Uh, yeah. yeah.

460
00:24:35,868 --> 00:24:37,368
You don't want to finish that?
Because I can...

461
00:24:37,403 --> 00:24:39,868
No, no, no. I'm fine.
I had a late...

462
00:24:39,903 --> 00:24:41,832
So, Troy is...
You guys just...

463
00:24:41,867 --> 00:24:44,367
It's like you guys living there,
just the two of you?

464
00:24:44,402 --> 00:24:46,032
No, no, no, no, no.

465
00:24:46,067 --> 00:24:49,517
It's me and Vickie,
but he got fired from his job...

466
00:24:49,552 --> 00:24:52,967
and so he needed a place
to crash for a couple weeks.

467
00:24:53,002 --> 00:24:56,767
They caught him
stealing a Snickers.

468
00:24:56,802 --> 00:24:59,966
He stole a Snickers bar?

469
00:25:00,001 --> 00:25:01,866
Yeah. Ha ha ha!

470
00:25:01,966 --> 00:25:04,366
Somehow he can rationalize it...

471
00:25:04,466 --> 00:25:09,366
like the establishment
owes him a Snickers.

472
00:25:09,466 --> 00:25:10,766
Right, right.

473
00:25:10,866 --> 00:25:13,465
Well, I mean...
I guess... you know...

474
00:25:19,965 --> 00:25:22,165
You know, you're very beautiful.

475
00:25:24,265 --> 00:25:26,365
I mean... I mean, um...

476
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,465
Seriously, you're...

477
00:25:29,464 --> 00:25:36,864
I'm, uh... I'm, uh... not really
good with compliments.

478
00:25:37,964 --> 00:25:39,464
Um... but, uh...

479
00:25:39,564 --> 00:25:42,964
Um... Ha ha!
Are you religious?

480
00:25:45,463 --> 00:25:48,128
Um... Ha ha ha!

481
00:25:48,163 --> 00:25:50,828
Ha ha ha!
I'm sorry.

482
00:25:50,863 --> 00:25:55,063
I guess I'm...
I guess I'm, uh...

483
00:25:55,098 --> 00:25:57,063
a non-practicing Jew.

484
00:25:57,163 --> 00:25:59,463
Hey, I'm
a non-practicing virgin.

485
00:26:04,662 --> 00:26:06,427
Who's this again?

486
00:26:06,462 --> 00:26:07,962
Frampton.
Peter Frampton.

487
00:26:07,997 --> 00:26:09,427
Frampton...

488
00:26:09,462 --> 00:26:10,962
I can't believe you
don't remember...

489
00:26:10,997 --> 00:26:12,427
"Frampton Comes Alive. "

490
00:26:12,462 --> 00:26:15,426
That album, like,
totally changed my life.

491
00:26:15,461 --> 00:26:21,261
The most profound, important
invention of my lifetime...

492
00:26:21,361 --> 00:26:23,261
the Big Gulp.

493
00:26:23,361 --> 00:26:25,261
And because, see...
No, listen.

494
00:26:25,296 --> 00:26:26,726
You get one in the morning.

495
00:26:26,761 --> 00:26:29,561
I'm talking forty-four ouncer,
not this thirty-two wimpy...

496
00:26:29,596 --> 00:26:32,577
- Wait a minute. Forty four?
- Yeah. Forty-four ounce.

497
00:26:32,612 --> 00:26:37,960
How can you ingest
forty-four ounces of anything?

498
00:26:37,995 --> 00:26:39,425
You get one.

499
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:41,960
You have your essential vitamins
and nutrients...

500
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:43,460
for the entire day.

501
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:46,460
Oh, yeah. Definitely.
I'm sure you're totally covered.

502
00:26:46,659 --> 00:26:48,459
- You do.
- Well...

503
00:26:48,659 --> 00:26:51,959
I guess it really doesn't
take much to make me happy.

504
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:54,959
Hey, I'm not
materialistic, either.

505
00:26:55,059 --> 00:26:58,459
I mean, I think I'd be working
even if I wasn't getting paid.

506
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:01,959
And I don't, like, want to get,
you know... a big house.

507
00:27:02,059 --> 00:27:04,958
I just want, like,
a nice house.

508
00:27:05,058 --> 00:27:07,958
I'm not into cars and stuff.

509
00:27:08,058 --> 00:27:10,523
I mean, I like my car.

510
00:27:10,558 --> 00:27:13,558
You're probably not
really not into, like...

511
00:27:13,593 --> 00:27:16,558
expensive, snazzy
Italian suits, either.

512
00:27:16,658 --> 00:27:18,657
- Oh, come on.
- I'm just kidding.

513
00:27:18,692 --> 00:27:20,374
- No, no, no.
- I'm just kidding.

514
00:27:20,409 --> 00:27:22,233
Wait a minute.
I'm not like that.

515
00:27:22,268 --> 00:27:24,057
I'm really not.
I mean... I mean...

516
00:27:24,092 --> 00:27:27,022
I'm... I'm... I mean...

517
00:27:27,057 --> 00:27:29,357
I know why the caged bird
sings and everything.

518
00:27:29,392 --> 00:27:31,122
Oh, yeah? Why?

519
00:27:31,157 --> 00:27:34,356
Because he was... in a cage,
and he was...

520
00:27:34,391 --> 00:27:37,556
I don't know.
He had high hopes or something.

521
00:27:37,591 --> 00:27:39,373
OK, I dropped out of school...

522
00:27:39,408 --> 00:27:40,982
before we got to that,
all right?

523
00:27:41,017 --> 00:27:42,521
I should have stayed
in college...

524
00:27:42,556 --> 00:27:44,556
and got a degree
in astronomy or something.

525
00:27:44,591 --> 00:27:46,373
- Oh, god, I love astronomy.
- Really?

526
00:27:46,408 --> 00:27:48,121
Yeah. I just...
The math, though.

527
00:27:48,156 --> 00:27:50,555
It was the math that just,
like... got me every time.

528
00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:52,555
I loved astronomy, too,
and I got into class...

529
00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:54,120
and it was like...
it was like...

530
00:27:54,155 --> 00:27:59,555
everything was three-squared
times pi equals the root of pi.

531
00:27:59,590 --> 00:28:02,155
Yeah. And I just wanted
to look at the stars.

532
00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:05,054
- It was so...
- Same here exactly.

533
00:28:06,054 --> 00:28:09,054
I remember being so happy
on the roof of our old house...

534
00:28:09,089 --> 00:28:11,154
just staring up at the stars.

535
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:12,619
Mmm...

536
00:28:12,654 --> 00:28:16,154
I want to do that again.
I want to just...

537
00:28:16,189 --> 00:28:19,654
look up at the stars
and take the time to...

538
00:28:19,689 --> 00:28:22,653
smell the...

539
00:28:22,753 --> 00:28:24,053
everything.

540
00:28:26,753 --> 00:28:30,053
Because it's like... do you ever
have those moments in life...

541
00:28:30,253 --> 00:28:33,053
where everything is OK?
Do you know what I mean?

542
00:28:33,253 --> 00:28:35,653
Just for, like, one moment,
everything is great.

543
00:28:35,753 --> 00:28:39,652
Not since I graduated, no.
But yeah... yeah.

544
00:28:39,687 --> 00:28:43,552
When you, like, catch yourself
in a moment...

545
00:28:43,752 --> 00:28:46,552
and you're saying, wait,
I'm happy here in the moment.

546
00:28:46,652 --> 00:28:49,152
Right. And then it
just goes away really quickly.

547
00:28:49,252 --> 00:28:51,552
- Gone.
- It just... It's...

548
00:28:51,651 --> 00:28:53,651
I know I've had
a couple of those, you know.

549
00:28:53,686 --> 00:28:55,651
I always forget them,
but I know I've had them.

550
00:28:55,686 --> 00:28:57,251
Oh, me, too.

551
00:29:01,551 --> 00:29:04,051
Like right now... is one.

552
00:29:06,951 --> 00:29:08,950
Yeah... like now.

553
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:14,750
Clouds are stalking

554
00:29:14,785 --> 00:29:17,250
Islands in the sun

555
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:21,750
Wish I could dry one

556
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:24,449
Out of season

557
00:29:26,049 --> 00:29:27,749
But don't

558
00:29:29,049 --> 00:29:30,949
Hesitate

559
00:29:32,449 --> 00:29:34,949
'Cause your love

560
00:29:36,249 --> 00:29:38,598
Won't wait

561
00:29:38,633 --> 00:29:40,913
Hey, hey, hey

562
00:29:40,948 --> 00:29:44,248
Ooh, baby, I love your way

563
00:29:44,283 --> 00:29:45,748
Every day

564
00:29:47,648 --> 00:29:50,748
Want to tell you I love your way

565
00:29:50,783 --> 00:29:52,748
Ooh, ooh, ooh

566
00:29:55,847 --> 00:29:58,247
TROY, Ooh, baby,
I love your way

567
00:29:58,282 --> 00:29:59,712
Every day

568
00:29:59,747 --> 00:30:01,547
I want to be with you
night and day

569
00:30:01,647 --> 00:30:02,747
Shh!

570
00:30:02,847 --> 00:30:04,747
So, you've been up all night?

571
00:30:06,347 --> 00:30:11,046
I am picking up some
very strange vibes in here.

572
00:30:11,081 --> 00:30:15,746
They're of the...
"I just got laid" variety.

573
00:30:16,246 --> 00:30:17,546
Did he dazzle you...

574
00:30:17,646 --> 00:30:20,446
with his extensive knowledge
of mineral water?

575
00:30:20,546 --> 00:30:24,546
Or was it his in-depth analysis
of Markie Mark...

576
00:30:24,646 --> 00:30:26,410
that finally reeled you in?

577
00:30:26,445 --> 00:30:29,145
I just would have liked
to have been there...

578
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:31,110
to watch
how you rationalized...

579
00:30:31,145 --> 00:30:33,845
sleeping with a yuppy-head
cheeseball on the first date.

580
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:35,210
He's not a yuppy.

581
00:30:35,245 --> 00:30:37,745
He's the reason
why Cliff Notes were invented.

582
00:30:39,145 --> 00:30:41,109
Well, that pales
in comparison...

583
00:30:41,144 --> 00:30:43,444
to the tweaked-out
little skanks you date.

584
00:30:44,544 --> 00:30:45,909
To hell with it.
What do I care?

585
00:30:45,944 --> 00:30:48,344
What do you care?
And why are you acting...

586
00:30:48,544 --> 00:30:50,744
like a jealous boyfriend
all of a sudden?

587
00:30:50,779 --> 00:30:54,144
I am not acting like anything.

588
00:30:54,179 --> 00:30:56,743
I am calmly reading.

589
00:30:58,043 --> 00:31:01,108
God. If something's
bothering you that much...

590
00:31:01,143 --> 00:31:03,443
I wish you could just be man
enough to talk to me about it.

591
00:31:05,143 --> 00:31:06,943
All right, Lelaina.

592
00:31:20,242 --> 00:31:22,042
I am really in love with you.

593
00:31:27,642 --> 00:31:31,141
Is that what you want to hear?
Is it?

594
00:31:31,176 --> 00:31:34,541
Well, don't flatter yourself.

595
00:31:38,141 --> 00:31:39,741
Go to hell.

596
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:55,105
Since I've been
manager here...

597
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:59,639
our gross has increased
over twenty percent.

598
00:31:59,674 --> 00:32:02,239
So...
What?

599
00:32:02,274 --> 00:32:05,204
OK. OK. Um...

600
00:32:05,239 --> 00:32:06,639
I guess I'm proud of that.

601
00:32:06,739 --> 00:32:09,304
Oh, please.
Look at this sweater.

602
00:32:09,339 --> 00:32:12,039
People don't know.
They don't know what it takes.

603
00:32:12,074 --> 00:32:14,404
I've never been
a good example before...

604
00:32:14,439 --> 00:32:18,138
and, um... I've never been good
with responsibility.

605
00:32:18,238 --> 00:32:20,838
So, uh...
I blame my parents, though.

606
00:32:20,938 --> 00:32:23,738
I think I was conceived
on an acid trip.

607
00:32:25,138 --> 00:32:29,703
My parents got divorced
when I was 5 years old.

608
00:32:29,738 --> 00:32:33,237
And I saw my father about
three times a year after that.

609
00:32:34,837 --> 00:32:37,237
And when he found out
that he had cancer...

610
00:32:37,272 --> 00:32:39,202
he decided to bring me here...

611
00:32:39,237 --> 00:32:41,737
and he gives me
this big pink sea shell...

612
00:32:41,772 --> 00:32:43,202
and he says to me...

613
00:32:43,237 --> 00:32:46,236
"Son, the answers are all
inside of this. "

614
00:32:46,271 --> 00:32:47,836
And I'm all, like, "What?"

615
00:32:47,936 --> 00:32:50,236
But then I realized
that the shell was empty.

616
00:32:50,271 --> 00:32:51,736
There's no point
to any of this.

617
00:32:51,771 --> 00:32:53,236
It's all just a...

618
00:32:54,436 --> 00:32:56,736
A random lottery
of meaningless tragedy...

619
00:32:56,771 --> 00:32:59,136
and a series
of near escapes.

620
00:33:01,236 --> 00:33:04,735
So I take pleasure
in the details, you know.

621
00:33:04,770 --> 00:33:08,035
A Quarter-Pounder with cheese.

622
00:33:08,135 --> 00:33:10,200
Those are good.

623
00:33:10,235 --> 00:33:16,035
The sky about... ten minutes
before it starts to rain.

624
00:33:16,135 --> 00:33:19,634
The moment where your laughter
becomes a cackle.

625
00:33:21,134 --> 00:33:26,234
And I sit back, and I...
I smoke my Camel straights.

626
00:33:28,334 --> 00:33:30,999
And I ride my own melt.

627
00:33:31,034 --> 00:33:33,233
Come on. Come on.
No lagging.

628
00:33:33,333 --> 00:33:35,233
The free clinic A.I.D.S. test.

629
00:33:35,333 --> 00:33:37,933
The rite of passage
for our generation.

630
00:33:38,033 --> 00:33:40,233
We're so lucky.
Come on.

631
00:33:40,333 --> 00:33:44,733
So, Vick, why are you
getting tested?

632
00:33:44,833 --> 00:33:47,133
One of my friends
tested positive.

633
00:33:48,433 --> 00:33:51,832
To be on the safe side...
you know.

634
00:33:56,832 --> 00:33:58,332
Vickie Miner.

635
00:34:03,032 --> 00:34:05,131
Vickie Miner.

636
00:34:09,531 --> 00:34:11,096
You can forget it.

637
00:34:11,131 --> 00:34:13,331
Come on, Grant.
That... It's incredible.

638
00:34:13,366 --> 00:34:15,596
It's junk.
Depressing junk.

639
00:34:15,631 --> 00:34:17,431
You know my rules
for the "Video View"...

640
00:34:17,531 --> 00:34:18,931
light and perky.

641
00:34:19,031 --> 00:34:23,330
Look, Lelaina, maybe I should
talk to Grant alone about this.

642
00:34:26,330 --> 00:34:28,330
Look, she's got real talent...

643
00:34:28,365 --> 00:34:30,295
and I want to put her on staff.

644
00:34:30,330 --> 00:34:32,330
I will not have
Miss Pierce on staff.

645
00:34:32,365 --> 00:34:34,330
I will walk out of here
if that happens.

646
00:34:34,365 --> 00:34:35,794
You watch.

647
00:34:35,829 --> 00:34:38,529
OK, calm down.
It's no big deal.

648
00:34:38,564 --> 00:34:40,294
We don't have to have her.

649
00:34:40,329 --> 00:34:41,794
Besides,
having to look...

650
00:34:41,829 --> 00:34:43,829
at that girl's pointy
little face all day...

651
00:34:43,864 --> 00:34:45,346
it would make me ill.

652
00:34:45,381 --> 00:34:46,794
Just get rid of her...

653
00:34:46,829 --> 00:34:49,129
like I asked you to do
in the first place.

654
00:34:56,528 --> 00:34:58,028
...I'll get there.

655
00:34:58,128 --> 00:35:00,828
If I don't know where to go,
I'll get there.

656
00:35:00,863 --> 00:35:02,528
If I don't know...

657
00:35:08,027 --> 00:35:09,327
Ten seconds...

658
00:35:09,427 --> 00:35:11,827
nine, eight, seven...

659
00:35:11,927 --> 00:35:15,327
six, five, four...

660
00:35:24,926 --> 00:35:27,091
Is this a good morning or what?

661
00:35:27,126 --> 00:35:31,491
Ha ha ha! Well, with us today
is Libby Kumbaugh...

662
00:35:31,526 --> 00:35:35,326
the author of this book...
"Mommy, Why Do I Hate Myself?

663
00:35:35,426 --> 00:35:38,025
"Self-Esteem
for Parent and Child. "

664
00:35:38,125 --> 00:35:40,625
- Good morning, Libby.
- Good morning, Grant.

665
00:35:40,725 --> 00:35:45,925
Good morning! Now, Libby...
I'm concerned with self-esteem.

666
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:48,025
Personally, I've always had
an odd preference...

667
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:50,425
for very, very young girls.

668
00:35:53,425 --> 00:35:54,524
I...

669
00:35:57,024 --> 00:36:00,024
Being a total prick...

670
00:36:02,224 --> 00:36:06,124
...Iy pear, I...

671
00:36:06,224 --> 00:36:09,623
Why don't we welcome
this audience again, huh?

672
00:36:09,723 --> 00:36:10,723
Good morning!

673
00:36:13,323 --> 00:36:15,888
I make more of a mess
than Ruby does.

674
00:36:15,923 --> 00:36:17,923
Hi. You guys, we have to have
a family meeting.

675
00:36:17,958 --> 00:36:19,223
Something's happened.

676
00:36:19,323 --> 00:36:21,123
Oh, no! They've discovered
Nutrasweet causes you...

677
00:36:21,158 --> 00:36:22,388
to grow a third eye.

678
00:36:22,423 --> 00:36:23,923
Let me just say that
everything's gonna be fine.

679
00:36:23,958 --> 00:36:25,439
Yeah,
it's not a big deal.

680
00:36:25,474 --> 00:36:26,948
She'll just wear
a patch over it.

681
00:36:26,983 --> 00:36:28,387
I'm working out a plan.

682
00:36:28,422 --> 00:36:29,922
Yeah, there's
a surgeon in Paris.

683
00:36:29,957 --> 00:36:31,387
He'll just remove it
for free.

684
00:36:31,422 --> 00:36:33,872
- Just don't panic.
- It's not contagious.

685
00:36:33,907 --> 00:36:36,322
Would you shut up?
I just got fired.

686
00:36:37,322 --> 00:36:38,222
Yeah.

687
00:36:38,322 --> 00:36:40,421
Oh, my god.
What happened?

688
00:36:40,456 --> 00:36:42,921
You got fired?

689
00:36:43,021 --> 00:36:45,921
I mean, that just screws up
my whole idea of good and evil.

690
00:36:46,021 --> 00:36:49,221
It's not like I had
a hysterectomy or anything.

691
00:36:49,256 --> 00:36:52,421
I just... I got fired. I'll find
something else, you know.

692
00:36:52,521 --> 00:36:54,421
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

693
00:36:54,521 --> 00:36:56,285
You're hired.

694
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:58,320
I need a part-timer.
You need a job.

695
00:36:58,355 --> 00:36:59,420
That would be so cool.

696
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,420
It's only, like, five dollars
an hour. No big deal.

697
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:02,920
But it's a pretty good
opportunity.

698
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:04,420
Yeah,
it's a dream come true.

699
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:05,920
It is.

700
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:08,420
You know, Vick,
I said I'm working out a plan.

701
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:09,920
Yeah.
So, what's the plan?

702
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:12,919
I'm not gonna work
at the Gap, for Christ's sake.

703
00:37:13,019 --> 00:37:14,519
OK?

704
00:37:15,519 --> 00:37:19,419
- No. I mean...
- Oh, no. I'm so sorry.

705
00:37:19,519 --> 00:37:23,319
Oh, how stupid of me to try
to drag you down to my level.

706
00:37:23,354 --> 00:37:27,019
- Vickie, you don't do this, OK?
- Shut up.

707
00:37:27,054 --> 00:37:29,385
Come on.
This is just...

708
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:31,718
You know I didn't mean it.
Vickie.

709
00:37:55,017 --> 00:37:57,017
You see, this is
where Troy was fired...

710
00:37:57,052 --> 00:37:58,482
from his eleventh job.

711
00:37:58,517 --> 00:38:01,016
He was an illustrious
office cleaner.

712
00:38:02,016 --> 00:38:03,481
Now if you'll come
this way, please...

713
00:38:03,516 --> 00:38:05,916
we will continue our short
but happy walking tour...

714
00:38:05,951 --> 00:38:07,916
of the career
of Troy Dyer.

715
00:38:08,116 --> 00:38:11,481
And here we have
the newsstand...

716
00:38:11,516 --> 00:38:14,515
where Troy dared
to ask the question...

717
00:38:14,550 --> 00:38:16,515
Are employee snacks subsidized?

718
00:38:17,915 --> 00:38:20,215
The answer... tragically, no.

719
00:38:20,250 --> 00:38:22,480
In total, he has been fired...

720
00:38:22,515 --> 00:38:25,015
from... yes, count them...
twelve jobs.

721
00:38:25,115 --> 00:38:26,515
Twelve? Ouch.

722
00:38:26,615 --> 00:38:29,015
So you shouldn't feel so bad.

723
00:38:29,115 --> 00:38:32,014
One of these mornings, I'm going
to wake up before noon and...

724
00:38:32,114 --> 00:38:34,014
Ha ha. Yeah, right.

725
00:38:34,114 --> 00:38:37,014
And I'm gonna turn on the TV...

726
00:38:37,114 --> 00:38:39,014
and there Bryant Gumbel
will be, and he'll say...

727
00:38:39,114 --> 00:38:41,179
"Today we have with us...

728
00:38:41,214 --> 00:38:45,114
"the Pulitzer Prize winning
documentarian Lelaina Pierce.

729
00:38:45,149 --> 00:38:49,013
"Lelaina, after your first film,
Why Barbie Is Bad... "

730
00:38:50,513 --> 00:38:52,913
"You seem to have forgotten
all about...

731
00:38:53,113 --> 00:38:54,713
"your best friend, Troy Dyer. "

732
00:38:54,748 --> 00:38:56,678
Troy who?

733
00:38:56,713 --> 00:38:58,213
What was that name again?

734
00:38:58,313 --> 00:39:00,913
Oh, right through the heart.

735
00:39:01,013 --> 00:39:03,612
I'll probably be working
at the Whole Foods...

736
00:39:03,647 --> 00:39:04,577
playing warehouses...

737
00:39:04,612 --> 00:39:06,512
hanging around places
like the Radio Shack...

738
00:39:06,612 --> 00:39:08,212
screaming that
I used to know you...

739
00:39:08,247 --> 00:39:10,029
and you'll be there
in the lights...

740
00:39:10,064 --> 00:39:11,812
and you'll be all beautiful
and shit.

741
00:39:11,912 --> 00:39:15,112
Oh, Troy. No, no, no.
That'll never happen.

742
00:39:15,147 --> 00:39:18,111
They would never hire you
at Whole Foods.

743
00:39:20,111 --> 00:39:23,261
You see, Lainie,
this is all we need...

744
00:39:23,296 --> 00:39:26,411
a couple of smokes,
a cup of coffee...

745
00:39:27,811 --> 00:39:30,211
And a little bit
of conversation.

746
00:39:30,311 --> 00:39:32,610
You and me and five bucks.

747
00:39:32,645 --> 00:39:34,110
You got it.

748
00:39:35,610 --> 00:39:38,110
- You know what?
- Hmm?

749
00:39:44,610 --> 00:39:46,910
- No, no, no.
- What?

750
00:39:47,010 --> 00:39:48,274
Troy, I can't. I can't.

751
00:39:48,309 --> 00:39:50,209
Why not?
You never thought about it?

752
00:39:50,309 --> 00:39:52,609
Well, yes, of course
I have, but I...

753
00:39:52,644 --> 00:39:53,774
But what?

754
00:39:53,809 --> 00:39:55,574
I can't not be friends
with you, OK?

755
00:39:55,609 --> 00:39:57,609
I don't want that. That's not
what I'm talking about.

756
00:39:57,644 --> 00:40:01,609
I'm talking about a...
you know, evolving.

757
00:40:01,644 --> 00:40:03,109
I just can't handle
this right now.

758
00:40:03,209 --> 00:40:05,608
I can't evolve right now.

759
00:40:05,708 --> 00:40:08,108
Why not?
Because of Michael?

760
00:40:08,208 --> 00:40:09,608
No.

761
00:40:11,308 --> 00:40:14,208
Yeah. Yes. Yes.

762
00:40:26,007 --> 00:40:28,607
My parents got divorced
when I was fourteen.

763
00:40:28,707 --> 00:40:30,772
My dad... the dog...

764
00:40:30,807 --> 00:40:34,107
he remarried six months
after the divorce.

765
00:40:34,207 --> 00:40:36,606
Wow. That's quick.
How did everybody react?

766
00:40:36,706 --> 00:40:41,506
Um... my mom threatened
to kill herself in front of me.

767
00:40:41,606 --> 00:40:43,571
Patty got drunk in her closet...

768
00:40:43,606 --> 00:40:45,606
every morning
before junior high school.

769
00:40:45,641 --> 00:40:47,306
And you?

770
00:40:47,406 --> 00:40:50,171
Well, um...

771
00:40:50,206 --> 00:40:53,805
Somebody had to remember
to take out the trash...

772
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:57,272
sign the report cards,
buy the milk.

773
00:40:57,307 --> 00:41:00,705
So, um... that kind of ended up
being me.

774
00:41:00,805 --> 00:41:02,205
I don't want to get married...

775
00:41:02,305 --> 00:41:04,170
because I see
how my parents are.

776
00:41:04,205 --> 00:41:07,669
And they've been together,
like, 26 years...

777
00:41:07,704 --> 00:41:10,404
and they're like brother
and sister at this point.

778
00:41:10,439 --> 00:41:13,104
My mother goes to the bathroom
with the door open.

779
00:41:13,139 --> 00:41:14,669
That's "A."

780
00:41:14,704 --> 00:41:16,504
And "B"...
It's disgusting.

781
00:41:16,539 --> 00:41:18,269
I don't want any part of that.

782
00:41:18,304 --> 00:41:20,704
I want first kisses.
I want passion...

783
00:41:20,739 --> 00:41:22,568
the whole way through.

784
00:41:22,603 --> 00:41:27,003
It's better than having to kiss
your husband's ass all the time.

785
00:41:27,103 --> 00:41:28,568
Yeah.

786
00:41:28,603 --> 00:41:30,668
I think that your documentary...

787
00:41:30,703 --> 00:41:32,503
would be perfect
for "In Your Face. "

788
00:41:34,203 --> 00:41:35,568
- See? Forget it.
- No.

789
00:41:35,603 --> 00:41:37,602
You're probably thinking more
like, you know...

790
00:41:37,637 --> 00:41:39,167
P B.S. or something.

791
00:41:39,202 --> 00:41:41,602
No. No. You know
what it is, though?

792
00:41:41,637 --> 00:41:44,302
It's that I.. Boy.

793
00:41:44,402 --> 00:41:46,202
OK, when I made this thing...

794
00:41:46,302 --> 00:41:48,702
I kind of made
this promise to myself...

795
00:41:48,802 --> 00:41:50,102
that I wasn't going
to think about...

796
00:41:50,202 --> 00:41:53,501
where it was gonna end up
because I didn't want to...

797
00:41:53,601 --> 00:41:56,101
unintentionally
commercialize it.

798
00:41:56,201 --> 00:41:57,701
No,
I think that's great.

799
00:41:57,801 --> 00:41:59,701
I mean, I think
you should definitely...

800
00:41:59,801 --> 00:42:01,101
not unintentionally
do anything...

801
00:42:01,201 --> 00:42:02,701
that you're
not comfortable with.

802
00:42:02,801 --> 00:42:04,701
I mean, not that I would
intentionally...

803
00:42:04,801 --> 00:42:06,601
Well, plus
it's not done yet, you know.

804
00:42:06,801 --> 00:42:09,100
Right. I know. I know.
It was just a stupid...

805
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:11,600
You know... I got to go
to New York on Wednesday...

806
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:14,600
for this huge
network meeting thing...

807
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:17,700
which is totally...
God, you would hate it.

808
00:42:17,735 --> 00:42:20,265
I hate it. I just...
I just thought...

809
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:22,265
that they would freak out
over your tapes...

810
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:24,699
because they never see anything
that's really smart...

811
00:42:24,734 --> 00:42:29,299
and has real...
you know, quality and is...

812
00:42:29,334 --> 00:42:31,164
good, like you and your work...

813
00:42:31,199 --> 00:42:35,199
and I know
I'm being selfish and...

814
00:42:35,234 --> 00:42:38,164
Michael, um...

815
00:42:38,199 --> 00:42:41,663
That is literally, literally...

816
00:42:41,698 --> 00:42:45,948
the nicest thing
that anyone's ever said to me...

817
00:42:45,983 --> 00:42:50,198
the sweetest thing that anyone's
ever said to me.

818
00:42:57,197 --> 00:43:00,697
So, what are you doing
for the rest of your morning?

819
00:43:00,732 --> 00:43:02,697
What am...
Oh, what am I doing?

820
00:43:02,732 --> 00:43:04,662
What am I doing?

821
00:43:04,697 --> 00:43:06,947
Ooh. Well, I have
a job interview.

822
00:43:06,982 --> 00:43:09,197
Lelaina, this thing
is from 1988.

823
00:43:09,232 --> 00:43:11,161
I know. Ha ha ha!

824
00:43:11,196 --> 00:43:14,596
So you're, like...
six years late.

825
00:43:22,096 --> 00:43:24,596
I thought the ad said
that this was a job...

826
00:43:24,631 --> 00:43:26,461
for a production assistant.

827
00:43:26,496 --> 00:43:30,195
Yes. You will be
assisting me...

828
00:43:30,295 --> 00:43:34,195
in the production
of videotapes, all right?

829
00:43:34,295 --> 00:43:39,095
You're going to make
copies for me... many copies.

830
00:43:39,130 --> 00:43:43,894
Oh, is this like a...
like a pirate operation?

831
00:43:43,929 --> 00:43:46,894
Do I look like a pirate to you?

832
00:43:49,294 --> 00:43:51,694
Now, radio
is all instinct, Lelaina.

833
00:43:51,794 --> 00:43:54,194
Do you know where
all the radio comes from?

834
00:43:54,229 --> 00:43:56,494
The gut.
It's all in the gut.

835
00:43:56,594 --> 00:43:58,593
Because when you think
on your feet...

836
00:43:58,628 --> 00:44:00,058
got to go from your gut.

837
00:44:00,093 --> 00:44:03,093
And my gut is telling me
that, uh...

838
00:44:03,128 --> 00:44:04,558
this isn't gonna work out.

839
00:44:04,593 --> 00:44:07,693
Maybe your gut's just saying
you're hungry or...

840
00:44:07,728 --> 00:44:10,793
Oh, no, no, no, no.
It's telling me that, uh...

841
00:44:10,893 --> 00:44:13,193
you're overqualified
for this job.

842
00:44:13,228 --> 00:44:16,492
I'm really not that smart.

843
00:44:18,292 --> 00:44:20,492
No offense, sweetie,
but you don't have...

844
00:44:20,527 --> 00:44:22,657
any experience on a newspaper.
You're TV.

845
00:44:22,692 --> 00:44:26,092
Well, I'm trying to make my
transition to print journalism.

846
00:44:26,127 --> 00:44:27,557
Ah. Why?

847
00:44:27,592 --> 00:44:29,591
Well, newspapers are
the last watchdogs...

848
00:44:29,626 --> 00:44:31,056
of our... our government.

849
00:44:31,091 --> 00:44:32,891
They enforce
the checks and balances.

850
00:44:32,926 --> 00:44:34,691
And one half-hour of TV
only adds up to...

851
00:44:34,726 --> 00:44:36,491
OK. All right.

852
00:44:36,526 --> 00:44:38,891
Define irony.

853
00:44:39,091 --> 00:44:41,191
Irony. Uh...

854
00:44:41,226 --> 00:44:42,656
Irony.

855
00:44:42,691 --> 00:44:44,156
It's a noun.

856
00:44:44,191 --> 00:44:47,090
It's when something is...

857
00:44:47,190 --> 00:44:48,655
ironic. It's, uh...

858
00:44:48,690 --> 00:44:51,990
Well, I can't really
define irony...

859
00:44:52,025 --> 00:44:53,690
but I know it
when I see it!

860
00:45:16,188 --> 00:45:18,353
Hey. Hey.

861
00:45:18,388 --> 00:45:20,688
Oh, my god.
I've never been so glad...

862
00:45:20,788 --> 00:45:22,688
to see anyone
in my entire life.

863
00:45:22,788 --> 00:45:24,688
This day has been
the biggest nightmare.

864
00:45:24,788 --> 00:45:26,688
I mean, these
job interviews, Troy...

865
00:45:26,788 --> 00:45:29,688
the word vivisection,
a staggering understatement.

866
00:45:29,788 --> 00:45:31,952
Can you define irony?

867
00:45:31,987 --> 00:45:34,287
It's when the actual meaning
is the complete opposite...

868
00:45:34,322 --> 00:45:35,987
from the literal meaning.

869
00:45:36,022 --> 00:45:39,587
Yeah. My god.

870
00:45:40,787 --> 00:45:43,787
Where were you
when I needed you today?

871
00:45:43,887 --> 00:45:45,752
I... I should go.

872
00:45:45,787 --> 00:45:49,286
Oh, come on. Isn't there
some statute of limitations...

873
00:45:49,321 --> 00:45:51,386
for embarrassing incidents?

874
00:45:53,886 --> 00:45:56,086
Your bravado was embarrassing.

875
00:45:59,486 --> 00:46:02,351
Hey, Troy, come on.

876
00:46:02,386 --> 00:46:04,685
You can stay with me
for one cigarette.

877
00:46:04,785 --> 00:46:07,885
I know you can stay with me
for one cigarette.

878
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:10,985
You, me, five bucks,
good conversation.

879
00:46:11,085 --> 00:46:12,585
Right?

880
00:46:14,485 --> 00:46:15,685
Lainie...

881
00:46:17,785 --> 00:46:20,734
Troy, you haven't been home
in four days.

882
00:46:20,769 --> 00:46:23,684
I mean, where have you
been sleeping?

883
00:46:26,384 --> 00:46:27,984
I got to go.

884
00:46:34,683 --> 00:46:38,383
Mom, I need to talk to you
about a loan.

885
00:46:43,883 --> 00:46:45,483
Is it for drugs?

886
00:46:47,683 --> 00:46:50,282
No. No, it's not for drugs.

887
00:46:50,382 --> 00:46:53,282
I was f...
I lost my job.

888
00:46:54,382 --> 00:46:55,782
But you shouldn't have
any trouble...

889
00:46:55,882 --> 00:46:57,482
finding another job,
sugar bugger.

890
00:46:57,517 --> 00:46:59,147
No. See, I tried.

891
00:46:59,182 --> 00:47:01,782
I applied for every single
opening in my field...

892
00:47:01,882 --> 00:47:05,182
but there's just...
There's nothing right now.

893
00:47:06,381 --> 00:47:10,581
Hmm. Well...
then I hate to say it but...

894
00:47:10,681 --> 00:47:12,081
times are hard.

895
00:47:12,181 --> 00:47:14,081
You're just gonna
have to swallow your pride.

896
00:47:15,881 --> 00:47:18,881
Why don't you get a job
at Burgerama? They'll hire you.

897
00:47:18,916 --> 00:47:20,946
My lord, I saw on the TV...

898
00:47:20,981 --> 00:47:24,880
they had this little retarded
boy working the cash register.

899
00:47:24,915 --> 00:47:28,345
Because I'm not retarded, mom.

900
00:47:28,380 --> 00:47:31,280
I was valedictorian
of my university.

901
00:47:31,380 --> 00:47:35,980
Well, you don't have to put that
down on your application.

902
00:47:42,879 --> 00:47:44,844
Miss Pierce,
do you have any idea...

903
00:47:44,879 --> 00:47:48,344
what it means to be a cashier
at Wiener Schnitzel?

904
00:47:48,379 --> 00:47:52,179
Yeah. It's, uh... taking orders
and making change, and, uh...

905
00:47:52,214 --> 00:47:53,343
"thank you. "

906
00:47:53,378 --> 00:47:55,043
No. It's a juggling act.

907
00:47:55,078 --> 00:47:59,578
A juggling act? You mean,
like, metaphorically?

908
00:47:59,678 --> 00:48:02,378
No. I mean, you got people
coming at you from the front...

909
00:48:02,413 --> 00:48:04,878
coming at you from the back,
from the sides...

910
00:48:04,978 --> 00:48:06,878
people at the condiment
exchange...

911
00:48:06,978 --> 00:48:10,077
people at the drive-thru,
kids on bikes...

912
00:48:10,112 --> 00:48:12,377
and they're all
depending on who?

913
00:48:12,477 --> 00:48:13,877
- Me?
- Yeah.

914
00:48:13,977 --> 00:48:16,377
You got time to lean,
you got time to clean, buddy.

915
00:48:16,477 --> 00:48:17,742
All right?

916
00:48:17,777 --> 00:48:19,877
You got to be 150 percent
on your toes...

917
00:48:19,977 --> 00:48:21,477
150 percent of the time.

918
00:48:21,577 --> 00:48:24,376
There you go, sir.
And have a 'tude, wiener dude.

919
00:48:24,476 --> 00:48:25,976
All rightie.

920
00:48:26,976 --> 00:48:29,376
OK. I'm going to throw
a few numbers out at you...

921
00:48:29,476 --> 00:48:32,176
and you put them together in
your head as quick as you can.

922
00:48:32,211 --> 00:48:33,241
- OK?
- OK.

923
00:48:33,276 --> 00:48:34,776
Eighty-five and forty-five. Go.

924
00:48:35,976 --> 00:48:37,176
One... forty?

925
00:48:37,211 --> 00:48:37,976
Nope.

926
00:48:38,076 --> 00:48:40,240
- One... fifty?
- Nope.

927
00:48:40,275 --> 00:48:42,875
- One-sixty?
- It's not an auction.

928
00:48:42,975 --> 00:48:47,675
Miss Pierce, there's a reason
I've been here six months.

929
00:49:06,074 --> 00:49:07,474
For the entire summertime...

930
00:49:07,509 --> 00:49:08,739
occurring in one day.

931
00:49:08,774 --> 00:49:10,773
Then last night we had
snow reports in Utah.

932
00:49:10,808 --> 00:49:12,273
Today reports of I-70...

933
00:49:15,973 --> 00:49:17,438
Royalton Hotel.

934
00:49:17,473 --> 00:49:18,973
Oh, hi.
Is this the Royalton Hotel?

935
00:49:19,008 --> 00:49:20,438
That's what I said.

936
00:49:20,473 --> 00:49:21,938
Oh, sorry.
I didn't hear you.

937
00:49:21,973 --> 00:49:24,473
I'm looking for a guest there.
His name is Michael Grates.

938
00:49:24,508 --> 00:49:26,372
Hold one moment, please.

939
00:49:29,172 --> 00:49:30,537
That guest is out.

940
00:49:30,572 --> 00:49:32,437
Would you like
to leave a message?

941
00:49:32,472 --> 00:49:34,672
Oh... no. That's OK.
I'll just try again later.

942
00:49:34,707 --> 00:49:35,972
Thanks.

943
00:49:40,972 --> 00:49:44,471
Hi. I'm Cheryl Goode
and welcome to "Wedgie"...

944
00:49:44,571 --> 00:49:45,971
the world of hip couture.

945
00:49:46,071 --> 00:49:48,471
This week, we're
in south-central Los Angeles...

946
00:49:48,571 --> 00:49:50,471
at the intersection
of Florence and Normandy...

947
00:49:50,571 --> 00:49:52,471
the flashpoint of fashion.

948
00:49:52,571 --> 00:49:55,171
The phattest gangsta trend
will increase your peace.

949
00:49:55,206 --> 00:49:56,971
This bandanna by Donna Karin...

950
00:49:57,071 --> 00:49:59,470
is blue for Crips,
red for Bloods...

951
00:49:59,570 --> 00:50:01,270
and only costs
seventy-five dollars.

952
00:50:31,068 --> 00:50:33,068
Lainie, have you seen
a pack of guitar strings?

953
00:50:33,168 --> 00:50:35,168
I have to bring them
to the club.

954
00:50:35,268 --> 00:50:36,833
You know,
I hope he knows...

955
00:50:36,868 --> 00:50:40,068
that he still has to
pay some rent around here.

956
00:50:40,103 --> 00:50:42,033
I mean... Ha ha.

957
00:50:42,068 --> 00:50:44,867
I don't know where he thinks
he's spending his nights, but...

958
00:50:46,267 --> 00:50:47,767
Do you know?

959
00:50:50,067 --> 00:50:53,267
I'm late for a jean-folding
seminar. Let's locomote.

960
00:50:59,866 --> 00:51:02,066
Now you can call
your own personal psychic...

961
00:51:02,101 --> 00:51:04,066
anytime 24 hours a day...

962
00:51:04,166 --> 00:51:07,266
thanks to the nationwide
Psychic Discovery Network.

963
00:51:07,301 --> 00:51:09,183
You can pick up the phone
and talk directly...

964
00:51:09,218 --> 00:51:11,066
with an established
professional psychic...

965
00:51:11,101 --> 00:51:13,166
in the privacy of your own home.

966
00:51:13,266 --> 00:51:16,265
I was unhappy in my career,
and I needed a change.

967
00:51:16,300 --> 00:51:18,030
But I didn't know what to do.

968
00:51:18,065 --> 00:51:22,265
It's just that nothing
is going down according to plan.

969
00:51:22,300 --> 00:51:25,065
I mean, my best friend...

970
00:51:25,165 --> 00:51:27,565
I feel like I've
lost him forever...

971
00:51:27,665 --> 00:51:32,064
and he was like
my touchstone, you know.

972
00:51:32,164 --> 00:51:33,564
This man...

973
00:51:33,664 --> 00:51:35,829
does his name start
with the letter "N"?

974
00:51:35,864 --> 00:51:40,564
Because I'm getting
a very strong "N" vibration.

975
00:51:40,664 --> 00:51:43,064
Newsstand.
"N," newsstand.

976
00:51:43,164 --> 00:51:44,564
He used to work
at a newsstand.

977
00:51:44,664 --> 00:51:46,064
Uh-huh.

978
00:51:46,164 --> 00:51:48,663
Oh, god.
This is unbelievable.

979
00:51:48,698 --> 00:51:51,128
Honey,
that's not all I'm getting.

980
00:51:51,163 --> 00:51:54,163
There are people
I know from high school...

981
00:51:54,198 --> 00:51:58,163
who are already married
and having babies.

982
00:51:58,198 --> 00:52:01,228
I mean, babies, OK?

983
00:52:01,263 --> 00:52:02,912
I can't even take care
of a Chia Pet.

984
00:52:02,947 --> 00:52:04,562
Well, honey,
I didn't have kids...

985
00:52:04,662 --> 00:52:06,562
until I was on
my third husband.

986
00:52:06,662 --> 00:52:08,062
Oh, really?

987
00:52:08,097 --> 00:52:09,462
All Geminis.

988
00:52:11,662 --> 00:52:13,762
You know
what I think, Tanell?

989
00:52:14,762 --> 00:52:16,912
I think you still
really love Monty.

990
00:52:16,947 --> 00:52:19,061
Yeah,
you're probably right...

991
00:52:19,161 --> 00:52:20,561
but it don't matter now.

992
00:52:20,661 --> 00:52:22,561
Oh, yes,
it does, Tanell.

993
00:52:22,661 --> 00:52:26,561
I know you're afraid,
but you've got to find him...

994
00:52:26,661 --> 00:52:29,661
and you've got to tell him
how you really feel.

995
00:52:29,761 --> 00:52:32,461
Find him? I got...

996
00:52:32,496 --> 00:52:33,960
Lelaina.

997
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:36,660
We need to talk to you.

998
00:52:39,860 --> 00:52:42,260
Hold on, Tanell.
Hold on.

999
00:52:42,360 --> 00:52:44,225
I'm on the phone.

1000
00:52:44,260 --> 00:52:45,560
Yeah, I can see that...

1001
00:52:45,660 --> 00:52:48,060
and we have a four-hundred
and six dollar phone bill...

1002
00:52:48,095 --> 00:52:51,276
mainly due to some calls
to a 1-900 number.

1003
00:52:51,311 --> 00:52:54,424
Lelaina,
I'm so seriously troubled...

1004
00:52:54,459 --> 00:52:56,459
Listen, we'd help you
out, but we're broke, too.

1005
00:52:56,494 --> 00:52:58,459
And you know we can't afford
a new deposit...

1006
00:52:58,494 --> 00:53:00,859
if the phone gets shut off.

1007
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:06,558
Maybe you could borrow
the money from Michael.

1008
00:53:06,593 --> 00:53:08,958
No, Sammy. Jesus.

1009
00:53:09,058 --> 00:53:11,223
Lainie,
what are you doing?

1010
00:53:11,258 --> 00:53:13,858
What are you doing?
You lay on that couch all day.

1011
00:53:13,958 --> 00:53:15,458
Those pajamas
are like your uniform.

1012
00:53:15,558 --> 00:53:17,858
You run up a four-hundred dollar
phone bill.

1013
00:53:17,893 --> 00:53:19,523
You watch TV.
You chain-smoke.

1014
00:53:19,558 --> 00:53:21,457
You don't go outside.
You don't do anything.

1015
00:53:21,492 --> 00:53:24,022
Man, you are in the bell jar.

1016
00:53:24,057 --> 00:53:29,957
Look, this is my apartment.
I signed the lease.

1017
00:53:30,057 --> 00:53:33,457
I let you move in here when you
had no job, no money...

1018
00:53:33,557 --> 00:53:35,457
and you sponged off me
for two months!

1019
00:53:35,557 --> 00:53:37,021
Sponged? Uh-huh.

1020
00:53:37,056 --> 00:53:38,556
And now Miss Big Power Marm...

1021
00:53:38,656 --> 00:53:39,956
Miss "I'm manager
of the Gap now"...

1022
00:53:40,056 --> 00:53:42,056
you think you can just come
in here and push me around?!

1023
00:53:42,156 --> 00:53:44,121
She's not being pushy.

1024
00:53:44,156 --> 00:53:47,856
Sammy, what are you even
doing here? You don't live here!

1025
00:53:47,891 --> 00:53:50,021
Hey, my little
unemployed waif...

1026
00:53:50,056 --> 00:53:52,855
you're the one who's looking
for work now, OK?

1027
00:53:52,890 --> 00:53:55,655
God, you're really
enjoying this, aren't you?

1028
00:53:55,690 --> 00:53:57,020
You're high.

1029
00:53:57,055 --> 00:53:59,655
Why don't you go take a walk
outside and get some fresh air?

1030
00:54:01,255 --> 00:54:03,955
You've been waiting for this
since the day we met.

1031
00:54:04,055 --> 00:54:06,255
Who told you that?
Your psychic partner?

1032
00:54:09,754 --> 00:54:12,554
I'll tell you the problem
with your generation.

1033
00:54:12,589 --> 00:54:14,019
You don't have any work ethic.

1034
00:54:14,054 --> 00:54:16,019
Now, you take your friend Troy,
for example.

1035
00:54:16,054 --> 00:54:18,554
I went out of my way to set up
an interview for him...

1036
00:54:18,589 --> 00:54:20,554
and he didn't even
bother to show up.

1037
00:54:22,054 --> 00:54:25,303
That wasn't his fault.
He asked me to call and cancel.

1038
00:54:25,338 --> 00:54:28,518
And everything was going on.
And it slipped my mind.

1039
00:54:28,553 --> 00:54:31,803
And I'm... sorry, but, you know,
I have a work ethic, dad.

1040
00:54:31,838 --> 00:54:35,445
I have a very strong work ethic,
you know. Ask anyone.

1041
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:38,266
Then all you got to do
is show some ingenuity, hmm?

1042
00:54:38,301 --> 00:54:41,052
Darling, I love you, and I hate
to break your plate...

1043
00:54:41,087 --> 00:54:43,017
but you got to grow up sometime.

1044
00:54:43,052 --> 00:54:47,052
Now, I want you to go out there
and show me some ingenuity, hmm?

1045
00:55:03,251 --> 00:55:06,151
Let me talk
with you, my baby

1046
00:55:06,186 --> 00:55:08,518
It is bad to say
that maybe

1047
00:55:08,553 --> 00:55:10,851
It is time for you
to say we

1048
00:55:10,886 --> 00:55:13,150
Came to share
a point of view

1049
00:55:13,185 --> 00:55:15,050
Living in the never-never

1050
00:55:15,150 --> 00:55:18,200
Dropping out of here together

1051
00:55:18,235 --> 00:55:21,250
I could spend some time
forever

1052
00:55:21,350 --> 00:55:24,150
With a girl like you,
let me hear you say

1053
00:55:24,185 --> 00:55:28,049
Let's go, ooh

1054
00:55:28,149 --> 00:55:33,649
You want to turn it in,
turn it into heaven, yeah

1055
00:55:33,684 --> 00:55:36,414
Let's go

1056
00:55:36,449 --> 00:55:38,414
Ooh, ooh, ooh

1057
00:55:38,449 --> 00:55:42,448
You want to turn it in,
turn it into heaven, yeah

1058
00:55:42,483 --> 00:55:45,348
Right here on earth.

1059
00:55:45,448 --> 00:55:49,048
Looking for tomorrow

1060
00:55:51,148 --> 00:55:54,148
Can you see us one day?

1061
00:55:56,148 --> 00:55:58,747
Beg or steal or borrow

1062
00:56:01,147 --> 00:56:04,047
We could live forever

1063
00:56:05,747 --> 00:56:08,347
Never to say never

1064
00:56:08,382 --> 00:56:10,947
You will be for me

1065
00:56:11,047 --> 00:56:14,346
I will fight for you, now

1066
00:56:14,446 --> 00:56:16,311
Let's go

1067
00:56:16,346 --> 00:56:18,246
Ooh, ooh, ooh

1068
00:56:18,346 --> 00:56:22,446
You want to turn it in,
turn it into heaven, yeah...

1069
00:56:26,746 --> 00:56:28,645
Well, that solves
our first problem.

1070
00:56:28,745 --> 00:56:30,645
Rent's due this week.

1071
00:56:34,045 --> 00:56:35,510
Well, well.

1072
00:56:35,545 --> 00:56:39,345
Look who finally decided
to grace us with his...

1073
00:56:40,845 --> 00:56:42,210
Presence.

1074
00:56:42,245 --> 00:56:44,544
This is...
This is, uh, Jean.

1075
00:56:44,644 --> 00:56:45,709
Janine.

1076
00:56:45,744 --> 00:56:50,744
Uh, Janine. Janine.
It's a little loud in the club.

1077
00:56:50,844 --> 00:56:52,244
Excuse me.

1078
00:56:53,744 --> 00:56:55,144
Can't stay here, Troy.

1079
00:56:55,244 --> 00:56:57,644
I'm just gonna
pick something up.

1080
00:56:57,744 --> 00:56:59,044
Well...

1081
00:56:59,144 --> 00:57:03,043
Mission accomplished.
Now leave.

1082
00:57:03,143 --> 00:57:04,908
I think maybe
I'm gonna wait...

1083
00:57:04,943 --> 00:57:07,243
Always the mistress
of etiquette, huh, Lainie?

1084
00:57:07,278 --> 00:57:08,708
Just out of curiosity...

1085
00:57:08,743 --> 00:57:10,843
why are you suddenly acting
like a jealous girlfriend?

1086
00:57:10,943 --> 00:57:13,443
All right. We're just
trying to pay bills here, OK?

1087
00:57:13,478 --> 00:57:15,707
So, Troy, if you got
any money...

1088
00:57:15,742 --> 00:57:19,342
Money? Oh, but what's
money to an artist?

1089
00:57:19,377 --> 00:57:22,942
To a philosopher?
It's just green-colored paper...

1090
00:57:23,042 --> 00:57:25,207
that floats in and out
of his life like snow.

1091
00:57:25,242 --> 00:57:27,642
It's nothing you actually have
to, I don't know, work for...

1092
00:57:27,677 --> 00:57:28,842
is it, Troy?

1093
00:57:28,942 --> 00:57:30,541
No, not if you have
daddy's little gas card.

1094
00:57:30,576 --> 00:57:32,006
You shut up!

1095
00:57:32,041 --> 00:57:34,641
You shut up! I busted my ass
to find a job, any job!

1096
00:57:34,676 --> 00:57:36,858
You don't even bother
showing up for interviews!

1097
00:57:36,893 --> 00:57:39,041
What is it that you want
from me? Huh? What is it?

1098
00:57:39,141 --> 00:57:40,541
You want me to get a job
on the line...

1099
00:57:40,641 --> 00:57:42,206
for the next 20 years,
until I'm granted leave...

1100
00:57:42,241 --> 00:57:44,591
with my gold-plated watch
and my balls full of tumors...

1101
00:57:44,626 --> 00:57:46,940
because I surrendered the one
thing that means shit to me?

1102
00:57:46,975 --> 00:57:48,405
Well, honey,
you can just exhale...

1103
00:57:48,440 --> 00:57:51,340
because it's not gonna happen,
not in this lifetime.

1104
00:57:52,340 --> 00:57:54,340
All right, fine!
You don't want to work, fine!

1105
00:57:54,375 --> 00:57:55,805
Lainie, goddamn it!

1106
00:57:55,840 --> 00:57:58,340
You want to be a band,
then be a goddamn band!

1107
00:57:58,375 --> 00:57:59,840
Rehearse every day!
Play every night!

1108
00:57:59,875 --> 00:58:01,305
Play three times a night!

1109
00:58:01,340 --> 00:58:05,339
Don't just dick around the same
coffeehouse for five years!

1110
00:58:05,439 --> 00:58:08,339
Don't dick around
with her or with me.

1111
00:58:08,439 --> 00:58:10,339
I mean, try at something,
for once in your life!

1112
00:58:10,439 --> 00:58:12,404
Do something about it,
but you know what?

1113
00:58:12,439 --> 00:58:14,839
You better do it now,
and you better do it fast...

1114
00:58:14,939 --> 00:58:17,438
because the world
doesn't owe you any favors...

1115
00:58:17,473 --> 00:58:18,903
and whether
you know it or not...

1116
00:58:18,938 --> 00:58:21,138
you're on the inside track
to Loserville, U.S.A...

1117
00:58:21,173 --> 00:58:23,438
just like him.

1118
00:58:33,337 --> 00:58:35,837
OK. It's just
too psychotic in here now.

1119
00:58:35,872 --> 00:58:38,337
All right, Lelaina,
let's go for a walk.

1120
00:58:39,637 --> 00:58:40,637
Fine.

1121
00:58:42,137 --> 00:58:44,937
Come on, man.
Let them go.

1122
00:58:47,437 --> 00:58:51,136
With pleasure, my friends.
With pleasure. Ha.

1123
00:58:51,236 --> 00:58:53,436
"With pleasure"? You know
who I really feel sorry for...

1124
00:58:53,471 --> 00:58:54,736
is that poor girl.

1125
00:58:54,936 --> 00:58:57,086
Oh, how about when he sneaks
his laundry in with ours?

1126
00:58:57,121 --> 00:58:59,236
It's like I'm pulling
that stuff out of the dryer...

1127
00:58:59,271 --> 00:59:00,736
and there's five pairs
of his boxers...

1128
00:59:00,771 --> 00:59:02,201
I just washed unknowingly.

1129
00:59:02,236 --> 00:59:03,986
No, I'll just throw it
back in his face.

1130
00:59:04,021 --> 00:59:06,127
Yeah, like I'm gonna
do his laundry. Yeah.

1131
00:59:06,162 --> 00:59:08,235
He's weird. He's strange.
He's sloppy.

1132
00:59:08,270 --> 00:59:10,300
He's a total nightmare
for women.

1133
00:59:10,335 --> 00:59:13,235
I can't believe
I haven't slept with him yet.

1134
00:59:14,535 --> 00:59:16,135
Do you ever wish
you were a lesbian?

1135
00:59:17,335 --> 00:59:20,134
Don't you think it would be
so much easier?

1136
00:59:21,634 --> 00:59:24,099
Sometimes, but...

1137
00:59:24,134 --> 00:59:26,384
Nah. I couldn't
go through with it.

1138
00:59:26,419 --> 00:59:28,676
I'd start laughing
or something.

1139
00:59:28,711 --> 00:59:30,934
But it's such a shame...

1140
00:59:31,134 --> 00:59:33,184
because I am
so through with men.

1141
00:59:33,219 --> 00:59:35,226
If one more guy
walks out on me...

1142
00:59:35,261 --> 00:59:37,198
I don't even know what.
I swear.

1143
00:59:37,233 --> 00:59:39,333
What are you
talking about...

1144
00:59:39,368 --> 00:59:41,433
Walk out on you?
You walk out on them.

1145
00:59:41,533 --> 00:59:42,898
I've seen you.

1146
00:59:42,933 --> 00:59:45,033
You're out the door
before the condom comes off.

1147
00:59:46,033 --> 00:59:48,533
Listen to me, I'm just
beating them to the punch.

1148
00:59:48,568 --> 00:59:49,733
OK.

1149
00:59:52,832 --> 00:59:55,732
You don't even know
I'm sitting here...

1150
00:59:55,832 --> 00:59:57,332
maybe...

1151
00:59:58,832 --> 01:00:00,632
Probably dying of A.I.D.S.

1152
01:00:07,631 --> 01:00:10,631
And I'm totally alone.

1153
01:00:14,731 --> 01:00:16,231
Vickie...

1154
01:00:17,731 --> 01:00:19,696
Well, uh...

1155
01:00:19,731 --> 01:00:21,431
you're not alone.

1156
01:00:23,430 --> 01:00:27,230
Hey. Look, I'm sorry
for everything I said...

1157
01:00:27,265 --> 01:00:30,547
and I'm sorry
for being such a bitch...

1158
01:00:30,582 --> 01:00:33,706
but I have to tell you,
you're not alone.

1159
01:00:33,741 --> 01:00:36,785
You're not, and you're not
dying of A.I.D.S.

1160
01:00:36,820 --> 01:00:39,829
You don't understand.
Every day, all day...

1161
01:00:39,864 --> 01:00:42,329
it's all that I think about, OK?

1162
01:00:42,364 --> 01:00:43,794
Every time I sneeze...

1163
01:00:43,829 --> 01:00:46,829
it's like I'm four sneezes away
from the hospice.

1164
01:00:46,864 --> 01:00:48,996
And it's like it's not even
happening to me.

1165
01:00:49,031 --> 01:00:51,129
It's like I'm watching it
on some crappy show...

1166
01:00:51,329 --> 01:00:52,629
like "Melrose Place"
or some shit, right?

1167
01:00:52,664 --> 01:00:53,893
And I'm the new character.

1168
01:00:53,928 --> 01:00:55,393
I'm the H.I.V.- A.I.D.S.
character...

1169
01:00:55,428 --> 01:00:57,528
and I live in the building,
and I teach everybody...

1170
01:00:57,563 --> 01:00:59,628
that it's OK to be near me,
it's OK to talk to me...

1171
01:00:59,728 --> 01:01:01,128
and then I die...

1172
01:01:01,228 --> 01:01:03,128
and there's everybody
at my funeral...

1173
01:01:03,228 --> 01:01:05,728
wearing halter tops and chokers
or some shit like that.

1174
01:01:07,028 --> 01:01:09,692
Vickie, stop, OK?
Just stop.

1175
01:01:09,727 --> 01:01:11,877
You're freaking out,
and you know what?

1176
01:01:11,912 --> 01:01:13,992
You're gonna have to deal
with the results.

1177
01:01:14,027 --> 01:01:15,827
Whatever they are, we're gonna
have to deal with them...

1178
01:01:15,862 --> 01:01:17,594
just like we've dealt
with everything else.

1179
01:01:17,629 --> 01:01:19,327
This isn't like
everything else.

1180
01:01:19,362 --> 01:01:21,527
I know that, all right?

1181
01:01:21,627 --> 01:01:24,327
But it's gonna be OK,
you know?

1182
01:01:24,362 --> 01:01:26,026
I know it's gonna be OK.

1183
01:01:30,826 --> 01:01:34,326
"Melrose Place"
is a really good show.

1184
01:01:42,425 --> 01:01:44,925
Lelaina Pierce.

1185
01:01:46,225 --> 01:01:49,025
Is there a Lelaina Pierce here?

1186
01:01:51,925 --> 01:01:53,225
Yeah.

1187
01:02:00,324 --> 01:02:01,824
Hello.
Lelaina?

1188
01:02:01,859 --> 01:02:03,024
Ha ha! Hi!

1189
01:02:03,124 --> 01:02:04,624
Look, I had to
call you right away.

1190
01:02:04,824 --> 01:02:06,324
Listen, listen.
Don't kill me, OK?

1191
01:02:06,359 --> 01:02:07,524
What? What?

1192
01:02:07,624 --> 01:02:09,124
I took the tape,
and I showed it.

1193
01:02:09,324 --> 01:02:10,789
No.

1194
01:02:10,824 --> 01:02:13,423
Wait, wait, wait. Listen.
They freaked out.

1195
01:02:13,458 --> 01:02:14,923
They want to buy them.

1196
01:02:14,958 --> 01:02:16,790
- No.
- Yes.

1197
01:02:16,825 --> 01:02:18,588
They liked it?

1198
01:02:18,623 --> 01:02:21,123
No, no. I mean, they, like,
psychotically loved it.

1199
01:02:21,158 --> 01:02:23,623
They want to pay you for it.

1200
01:02:23,723 --> 01:02:25,588
I know this isn't P B.S.,
but is this OK?

1201
01:02:25,623 --> 01:02:28,422
Yes! I was this close to selling
fruit at intersections.

1202
01:02:28,457 --> 01:02:30,387
Well, don't, all right?
Don't.

1203
01:02:30,422 --> 01:02:32,022
Just hang on, and I'm gonna
get you some money...

1204
01:02:32,057 --> 01:02:33,722
and I'm gonna be down there
in a few days...

1205
01:02:33,757 --> 01:02:34,987
and I just...
I'm just, like...

1206
01:02:35,022 --> 01:02:36,822
I'm thinking about you
every second here.

1207
01:02:38,322 --> 01:02:39,987
Hello! Hello! Hello!

1208
01:02:40,022 --> 01:02:41,522
Hello! Can you hear me now?

1209
01:02:41,557 --> 01:02:43,521
Where are you?

1210
01:02:43,721 --> 01:02:44,986
I'm in a phone booth.

1211
01:02:45,021 --> 01:02:47,086
Why are you
on a cellular phone?

1212
01:02:47,121 --> 01:02:49,521
I don't know.
I have no idea. I'm just...

1213
01:02:49,621 --> 01:02:53,121
Michael, Michael, Michael,
I... I really miss you!

1214
01:02:53,156 --> 01:02:55,421
I really miss you, too.
I love you. Oh! Whoa!

1215
01:02:55,456 --> 01:02:58,421
I mean... I mean...
you amaze me.

1216
01:02:58,456 --> 01:03:00,287
No! You amaze me!

1217
01:03:00,322 --> 01:03:01,971
Hello?

1218
01:03:02,006 --> 01:03:03,585
Can you hear me?

1219
01:03:03,620 --> 01:03:05,620
Michael, I'm losing you.

1220
01:03:05,720 --> 01:03:08,420
I'm gonna call you back.
Wait. What?

1221
01:03:12,520 --> 01:03:17,419
Pay phone outside...
always amazes me.

1222
01:03:17,919 --> 01:03:19,019
Hey.

1223
01:03:20,019 --> 01:03:22,019
"Try me. I'm free. "

1224
01:03:24,519 --> 01:03:26,519
Good mag. Good mag.

1225
01:03:28,819 --> 01:03:32,318
- Negatory.
- Yeah! All right!

1226
01:03:32,518 --> 01:03:34,818
Did you hear that?
Negative!

1227
01:03:35,018 --> 01:03:37,718
Here. Let me see that.

1228
01:03:37,753 --> 01:03:40,383
Hey, hey! All rightie!

1229
01:03:40,418 --> 01:03:42,418
Thanks
for the help, Lainie.

1230
01:03:42,453 --> 01:03:44,418
A celebration zoom.

1231
01:03:44,453 --> 01:03:47,182
OK. Enough.

1232
01:03:47,217 --> 01:03:49,417
- Ma!
- I'm right here, son.

1233
01:03:49,452 --> 01:03:51,382
- Ma.
- Yeah?

1234
01:03:51,417 --> 01:03:55,717
I have to tell you
some... thing.

1235
01:03:55,752 --> 01:04:01,017
I am... a... homo... sexual.

1236
01:04:02,016 --> 01:04:06,516
Oh, Christ. Is there a support
group that I can join...

1237
01:04:06,551 --> 01:04:10,016
to help me come to terms
with my own homophobia?

1238
01:04:10,051 --> 01:04:11,981
Yes, there is...

1239
01:04:12,016 --> 01:04:14,481
a group which is named
P F L.A.G...

1240
01:04:14,516 --> 01:04:19,415
Parents and Friends
of Lesbians and Gays.

1241
01:04:20,415 --> 01:04:23,380
Oh. Oh. P F L.A.G.

1242
01:04:23,415 --> 01:04:26,715
I'm beginning to like
the sound of that.

1243
01:04:29,215 --> 01:04:31,915
What you've just witnessed here
is a preenactment...

1244
01:04:31,950 --> 01:04:34,714
of events that are
about to take place.

1245
01:04:37,014 --> 01:04:43,714
Well... I came out to her, and...

1246
01:04:43,814 --> 01:04:47,514
she's still
a little bit upset.

1247
01:04:47,714 --> 01:04:49,513
But you know...

1248
01:04:51,113 --> 01:04:53,513
You know, I think
the real reason...

1249
01:04:53,613 --> 01:04:55,778
that I've been celibate
for so long...

1250
01:04:55,813 --> 01:04:59,513
isn't really because I'm
that terrified of the big "A"...

1251
01:04:59,613 --> 01:05:02,113
but because I can't really
start my life...

1252
01:05:02,148 --> 01:05:04,612
without being honest
about who I am and...

1253
01:05:06,612 --> 01:05:08,912
I want to be in there, too.

1254
01:05:09,112 --> 01:05:13,912
I want to feel miserable
and happy and all of that.

1255
01:05:14,112 --> 01:05:15,912
I mean, I...

1256
01:05:16,112 --> 01:05:17,912
I want to...

1257
01:05:20,211 --> 01:05:23,011
I want to be let back
in the house.

1258
01:05:33,511 --> 01:05:37,110
Hello. Oh, hi.

1259
01:05:37,310 --> 01:05:39,575
Um... sorry.

1260
01:05:39,610 --> 01:05:42,610
Just... the door was...

1261
01:05:42,645 --> 01:05:43,810
So I just, um...

1262
01:05:45,110 --> 01:05:47,110
Yeah, she's getting dressed.

1263
01:05:49,110 --> 01:05:50,210
Great.

1264
01:06:00,209 --> 01:06:01,709
I'll just...

1265
01:06:10,508 --> 01:06:12,508
Oh, I, um...
I don't know if she told you...

1266
01:06:12,543 --> 01:06:13,973
but I just came back
from New York...

1267
01:06:14,008 --> 01:06:17,108
with the tapes that she made,
and the stuff of you...

1268
01:06:17,143 --> 01:06:19,273
it's really...
it's really great stuff.

1269
01:06:19,308 --> 01:06:22,607
Really. That whole...
that whole thing about...

1270
01:06:22,642 --> 01:06:26,107
"Nobody can eat all the eggs,"
that was...

1271
01:06:26,142 --> 01:06:27,572
that was really...

1272
01:06:27,607 --> 01:06:29,607
I was quoting
Cool Hand Luke.

1273
01:06:31,307 --> 01:06:34,257
Yeah. That's OK.
I mean... That's... I know.

1274
01:06:34,292 --> 01:06:37,207
It's... I mean... You know...
It's still... It's...

1275
01:06:37,806 --> 01:06:39,706
Hi.

1276
01:06:39,806 --> 01:06:42,106
- Hi.
- Hi.

1277
01:06:42,206 --> 01:06:44,406
What happened
to your normal clothes?

1278
01:06:44,506 --> 01:06:46,556
Wow!
Lelaina, look at you.

1279
01:06:46,591 --> 01:06:49,598
You look...
Where'd you get that dress?

1280
01:06:49,633 --> 01:06:52,606
Oh, um... I don't know.
I just bought it.

1281
01:06:52,706 --> 01:06:55,305
But I think I'm gonna
go change because...

1282
01:06:55,340 --> 01:06:56,605
No, don't.
You look beautiful.

1283
01:06:56,705 --> 01:06:59,005
You look like...
You look like...

1284
01:06:59,040 --> 01:07:00,505
A doily.

1285
01:07:04,105 --> 01:07:06,570
- I'm gonna change.
- No, don't change.

1286
01:07:06,605 --> 01:07:08,804
And don't go thinking
for yourself either, Lainie.

1287
01:07:08,904 --> 01:07:11,004
Hey, what is your glitch, huh?

1288
01:07:11,039 --> 01:07:12,804
My "glitch"?

1289
01:07:12,904 --> 01:07:15,669
You know what?
We're already late.

1290
01:07:15,704 --> 01:07:17,954
No, no, no, no.
Hang on a second here.

1291
01:07:17,989 --> 01:07:20,246
Do you have, like, a problem
with me or something?

1292
01:07:20,281 --> 01:07:22,592
Because if you do, let's just
get this out, all right?

1293
01:07:22,627 --> 01:07:25,314
Seriously, is there, like...
I mean, have I, like, uh...

1294
01:07:25,349 --> 01:07:28,003
stepped over some line in
the sands of coolness with you?

1295
01:07:28,038 --> 01:07:29,768
Because.. Because...
No, no, no. Excuse me...

1296
01:07:29,803 --> 01:07:31,903
if somebody doesn't know
the secret handshake with you.

1297
01:07:32,003 --> 01:07:34,003
There's no secret handshake.

1298
01:07:34,103 --> 01:07:37,803
There's an I.Q. prerequisite,
but there's no secret handshake.

1299
01:07:39,403 --> 01:07:41,167
I... This is... You... No...

1300
01:07:41,202 --> 01:07:44,052
This guy... you've got this whole
thing with the world.

1301
01:07:44,087 --> 01:07:46,902
Don't you? Huh? That's great.
That's really wonderful.

1302
01:07:46,937 --> 01:07:48,502
But guess what.
I'm a human being, OK?

1303
01:07:48,602 --> 01:07:50,467
We're human beings,
people, OK?

1304
01:07:50,502 --> 01:07:54,702
We're not, like, intelligence
quotations or whatever.

1305
01:07:54,737 --> 01:07:56,701
- Just ignore him.
- No!

1306
01:07:56,736 --> 01:07:57,901
Done.

1307
01:08:01,201 --> 01:08:03,201
Come on. Let's go.
You don't need this.

1308
01:08:03,301 --> 01:08:05,101
You don't know
what she needs.

1309
01:08:07,301 --> 01:08:10,001
I think I know what she needs
in a way that you never will.

1310
01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:17,400
Let's go.

1311
01:08:23,300 --> 01:08:25,700
Baby, tell me
that my love ain't good

1312
01:08:25,800 --> 01:08:31,199
I don't treat you right,
I don't do you like I should...

1313
01:08:31,299 --> 01:08:33,699
Listen,
that's got to be back here, OK?

1314
01:08:33,899 --> 01:08:35,399
- Hi.
- Hi.

1315
01:08:36,399 --> 01:08:37,864
So, you ready?

1316
01:08:37,899 --> 01:08:39,699
Well, what's it like?
I mean...

1317
01:08:39,799 --> 01:08:41,399
It's great. It's great.

1318
01:08:41,499 --> 01:08:43,198
I mean, I haven't actually
seen it yet...

1319
01:08:43,298 --> 01:08:45,548
but we had our best guys
working on it...

1320
01:08:45,583 --> 01:08:48,190
and, you know, we just put
some titles on...

1321
01:08:48,225 --> 01:08:50,798
and shaped it a little bit.
It's gonna be great.

1322
01:08:50,833 --> 01:08:52,065
OK.

1323
01:08:52,100 --> 01:08:53,649
OK, OK.

1324
01:08:53,684 --> 01:08:55,198
OK. Thanks.

1325
01:08:56,198 --> 01:08:59,262
OK, everybody,
it's a special night...

1326
01:08:59,297 --> 01:09:01,297
because, as you know,
we're entering into...

1327
01:09:01,332 --> 01:09:02,797
a new phase
here at the channel...

1328
01:09:02,832 --> 01:09:04,762
real programming.

1329
01:09:04,797 --> 01:09:07,297
And our first step
is this remarkable piece...

1330
01:09:07,332 --> 01:09:08,697
by Lelaina.

1331
01:09:12,697 --> 01:09:14,596
So hang on, because
this is going to change...

1332
01:09:14,696 --> 01:09:16,396
the face
of "In Your Face. "

1333
01:09:45,494 --> 01:09:46,894
What's this?

1334
01:09:46,994 --> 01:09:49,394
It's just transitional stuff.

1335
01:09:50,294 --> 01:09:55,394
La la la-la la

1336
01:09:55,494 --> 01:10:01,793
The story of my life

1337
01:10:01,893 --> 01:10:02,858
We're finished!

1338
01:10:02,893 --> 01:10:06,758
School's out forever

1339
01:10:06,793 --> 01:10:09,993
I am not under any orders to
make the world a better place.

1340
01:10:10,093 --> 01:10:12,793
And you wonder
why we never got involved.

1341
01:10:12,828 --> 01:10:15,493
School's been blown to pieces

1342
01:10:15,528 --> 01:10:17,309
Love can make you weep

1343
01:10:17,344 --> 01:10:19,092
I don't want to get married...

1344
01:10:19,192 --> 01:10:20,492
because I see
how my parents are.

1345
01:10:20,592 --> 01:10:22,792
- My parents got divorced...
- My parents got divorced...

1346
01:10:22,827 --> 01:10:24,557
- When I was fourteen.
- When I was five years old.

1347
01:10:24,592 --> 01:10:27,492
My mother actually goes to
the bathroom with the door open.

1348
01:10:33,691 --> 01:10:36,391
I swore to myself
I'd never get married.

1349
01:10:36,426 --> 01:10:37,291
I want passion.

1350
01:10:37,391 --> 01:10:40,391
Let's talk about
sex, baby, let's talk about...

1351
01:10:40,426 --> 01:10:43,156
Turns you on, doesn't it?
Brownies!

1352
01:10:43,191 --> 01:10:47,490
Would you two just do it and get
it over with? I'm starving.

1353
01:10:47,525 --> 01:10:49,390
Oh, my god.

1354
01:10:49,490 --> 01:10:50,790
But the question remains...

1355
01:10:52,890 --> 01:10:55,690
How can we repair
all the damage we inherited?

1356
01:10:55,790 --> 01:10:57,990
I was told there'd be
no math on this exam.

1357
01:10:58,025 --> 01:10:59,457
Can I change my answer?

1358
01:10:59,492 --> 01:11:00,855
The answer is simple.

1359
01:11:00,890 --> 01:11:03,189
We're on a road
to nowhere

1360
01:11:03,224 --> 01:11:05,354
Jesus.

1361
01:11:05,389 --> 01:11:07,289
The answer is...
The-the-the answer is...

1362
01:11:07,389 --> 01:11:08,489
Pizza!

1363
01:11:08,524 --> 01:11:09,554
Pizza.

1364
01:11:09,589 --> 01:11:11,189
Pizza. Ha ha.

1365
01:11:20,988 --> 01:11:22,488
Oh...

1366
01:11:24,488 --> 01:11:26,888
- It's, um...
- Yeah, right.

1367
01:11:26,988 --> 01:11:29,988
We're on a road
to nowhere

1368
01:11:30,088 --> 01:11:32,988
But here we go

1369
01:11:33,023 --> 01:11:34,687
Lelaina.

1370
01:11:43,087 --> 01:11:45,487
Lelaina, look. I'm sorry,
all right? I didn't know.

1371
01:11:45,587 --> 01:11:47,487
That was not my work, Michael.
That's not what I did.

1372
01:11:47,587 --> 01:11:49,487
That's not what I want.
It had nothing!

1373
01:11:49,587 --> 01:11:51,486
I can't believe
I trusted you!

1374
01:11:51,586 --> 01:11:53,486
I had no idea!
I didn't see it!

1375
01:11:53,586 --> 01:11:55,986
I mean, look. I guess it was
probably a little slow...

1376
01:11:56,086 --> 01:11:57,486
and they cut it up
a little...

1377
01:11:57,586 --> 01:11:58,486
Cut it up?

1378
01:11:58,586 --> 01:12:00,551
They cut up everything
that meant anything to me!

1379
01:12:00,586 --> 01:12:03,086
I mean, I don't even think
you realize what you've done.

1380
01:12:03,121 --> 01:12:05,086
You don't get it.
You just don't get it!

1381
01:12:05,121 --> 01:12:07,050
I do get it!
Look. It just...

1382
01:12:07,085 --> 01:12:09,085
It's, like, you have
this great piece of work...

1383
01:12:09,120 --> 01:12:11,050
and we have this audience,
these kids...

1384
01:12:11,085 --> 01:12:13,085
and it's like trying to feed
them meatloaf or something...

1385
01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:14,550
and they don't want to
eat it, right?

1386
01:12:14,585 --> 01:12:16,335
So you have to give them, like,
"Here comes the plane.

1387
01:12:16,370 --> 01:12:18,085
"It's coming into the hangar.
Open up the hangar. "

1388
01:12:18,120 --> 01:12:19,185
But it's still meatloaf.

1389
01:12:19,285 --> 01:12:20,935
It was never meatloaf!

1390
01:12:20,970 --> 01:12:22,526
That's a bad...
I just...

1391
01:12:22,561 --> 01:12:24,049
Look, I'm sorry, all right?

1392
01:12:24,084 --> 01:12:25,584
They were just trying
to market it.

1393
01:12:25,619 --> 01:12:27,084
And I wish I could
be perfect, OK?

1394
01:12:27,119 --> 01:12:28,549
I wish I could be like Troy...

1395
01:12:28,584 --> 01:12:30,584
riding on his melted
cheese sandwich and everything.

1396
01:12:30,619 --> 01:12:32,101
Don't you dare bring Troy
into this.

1397
01:12:32,136 --> 01:12:33,549
Hey, I wish
I could be like him.

1398
01:12:33,584 --> 01:12:35,084
I wish I could live
off of creeds and mottoes...

1399
01:12:35,119 --> 01:12:36,549
and all that shit,
all right?

1400
01:12:36,584 --> 01:12:38,583
But I'm in the real world
here, OK?

1401
01:12:38,618 --> 01:12:41,048
And I have ideals also.

1402
01:12:41,083 --> 01:12:44,883
They're that I...
I care about you...

1403
01:12:44,983 --> 01:12:47,083
and I want
to make you happy...

1404
01:12:47,118 --> 01:12:48,583
and I'm...

1405
01:12:50,583 --> 01:12:52,033
I just...

1406
01:12:52,068 --> 01:12:53,482
Look...

1407
01:12:56,082 --> 01:12:58,982
I'll make them take
the pizza thing out, OK?

1408
01:13:03,082 --> 01:13:06,332
I'm just a bill

1409
01:13:06,367 --> 01:13:09,581
Yes, I'm only a bill

1410
01:13:09,681 --> 01:13:15,581
And I'm sitting here
on Capitol Hill

1411
01:13:15,681 --> 01:13:20,081
Well, it's a long,
long journey to...

1412
01:13:26,780 --> 01:13:29,180
How'd the big premiere
turn out?

1413
01:13:32,080 --> 01:13:33,280
Fine.

1414
01:13:40,779 --> 01:13:43,779
They were just
videotapes, right?

1415
01:13:45,279 --> 01:13:47,479
Who cares? Ha ha.

1416
01:13:50,279 --> 01:13:55,478
I just worked
so hard on them, you know?

1417
01:13:57,778 --> 01:14:00,278
I worked so hard.

1418
01:14:01,778 --> 01:14:04,243
Ah, forget it.
I just sound pathetic.

1419
01:14:04,278 --> 01:14:06,978
No, you don't.
You don't sound pathetic.

1420
01:14:08,278 --> 01:14:10,777
You know, I know
it sounds stupid...

1421
01:14:10,812 --> 01:14:13,277
but it really meant
something to me.

1422
01:14:14,677 --> 01:14:19,277
I know it wasn't gonna,
you know, end world hunger...

1423
01:14:19,312 --> 01:14:21,744
or, you know,
save the planet...

1424
01:14:21,779 --> 01:14:24,177
but it just meant
something to me.

1425
01:14:27,476 --> 01:14:29,276
I just don't...

1426
01:14:31,776 --> 01:14:34,976
Understand why things just can't
go back to normal...

1427
01:14:35,011 --> 01:14:37,241
at the end
of the half-hour...

1428
01:14:37,276 --> 01:14:39,676
like on "The Brady Bunch"
or something.

1429
01:14:42,275 --> 01:14:45,075
Well, because Mr. Brady
died of A.I.D.S.

1430
01:14:49,075 --> 01:14:51,375
Things don't work out like that.

1431
01:14:53,375 --> 01:14:58,874
I was really gonna be something
by the age of twenty-three.

1432
01:15:00,174 --> 01:15:04,374
Honey, all you have to be
by the age of twenty-three...

1433
01:15:04,409 --> 01:15:05,974
is yourself.

1434
01:15:09,974 --> 01:15:13,173
I don't know
who that is anymore.

1435
01:15:13,208 --> 01:15:14,573
Well, I do.

1436
01:15:16,973 --> 01:15:20,273
And we all love her.
I love her.

1437
01:15:21,773 --> 01:15:23,773
Uh...

1438
01:15:25,073 --> 01:15:27,373
She breaks my heart
again and again...

1439
01:15:27,408 --> 01:15:28,872
but, uh...

1440
01:15:30,172 --> 01:15:31,872
But I love her.

1441
01:16:32,468 --> 01:16:35,968
I've wanted you like this
for all these years.

1442
01:17:19,065 --> 01:17:20,165
Hey.

1443
01:17:20,265 --> 01:17:23,565
Hi. Ha ha.
Where are you going?

1444
01:17:23,600 --> 01:17:25,565
I have rehearsal.

1445
01:17:27,265 --> 01:17:30,565
At 8:24 in the morning?

1446
01:17:30,600 --> 01:17:32,365
Yeah. Ha ha.

1447
01:17:37,564 --> 01:17:39,429
- So... that's it?
- No.

1448
01:17:39,464 --> 01:17:41,764
No, that's not...
It's not it.

1449
01:17:41,799 --> 01:17:44,064
I just... I, uh...
I have to go.

1450
01:18:00,963 --> 01:18:05,562
Got a party mama,
got a cokehead dad

1451
01:18:09,262 --> 01:18:14,762
I'm the ultimate inversion,
the American man

1452
01:18:17,662 --> 01:18:22,661
Don't feel good,
but don't feel bad

1453
01:18:23,661 --> 01:18:27,161
It's me, you see, I'm nuthin'

1454
01:18:32,661 --> 01:18:35,061
I ain't left, I ain't right

1455
01:18:35,161 --> 01:18:36,725
I feel so alone

1456
01:18:36,760 --> 01:18:40,860
Before I was born,
I was all gone

1457
01:18:40,960 --> 01:18:44,560
Don't even make sense
that I wrote this song

1458
01:18:44,660 --> 01:18:45,925
'Cause...

1459
01:18:45,960 --> 01:18:48,360
Tell me it's not true.

1460
01:18:48,460 --> 01:18:51,660
It's me, you see, I'm nuthin'

1461
01:18:53,159 --> 01:18:55,659
I'm nuthin'

1462
01:18:57,859 --> 01:18:59,759
Nuthin'

1463
01:19:00,859 --> 01:19:02,359
That's me

1464
01:19:04,559 --> 01:19:06,659
I'm nuthin'

1465
01:19:13,058 --> 01:19:18,158
Lainie, sex is the quickest way
to ruin a friendship.

1466
01:19:18,193 --> 01:19:19,458
Come on.

1467
01:19:23,657 --> 01:19:25,907
Thank you.
We'll be right back...

1468
01:19:25,942 --> 01:19:28,157
with a new American cheese
snack idea.

1469
01:19:30,157 --> 01:19:32,557
You got a phone call.

1470
01:19:35,657 --> 01:19:36,857
Lelaina.

1471
01:19:36,892 --> 01:19:37,957
- Hi.
- Hi.

1472
01:19:38,057 --> 01:19:39,321
Don't say anything, all right?

1473
01:19:39,356 --> 01:19:41,621
Look, I screwed up, all right?
I know.

1474
01:19:41,656 --> 01:19:44,156
I should have protected
you and your work...

1475
01:19:44,191 --> 01:19:45,623
and I didn't,
and I'm sorry.

1476
01:19:45,658 --> 01:19:47,056
I'm so sorry that I didn't.

1477
01:19:47,156 --> 01:19:49,256
And I want to make this
up to you, OK?

1478
01:19:49,356 --> 01:19:51,156
You mean so much
to me, Lelaina...

1479
01:19:51,256 --> 01:19:52,856
and I just...

1480
01:19:52,956 --> 01:19:54,905
Look, two tickets,
all right, New York.

1481
01:19:54,940 --> 01:19:56,747
We go, and we give them
a presentation...

1482
01:19:56,782 --> 01:19:58,555
of the show
the way you want it done.

1483
01:19:58,590 --> 01:19:59,755
Michael, I don't...

1484
01:19:59,855 --> 01:20:01,655
I know. I know,
but this time is different.

1485
01:20:01,755 --> 01:20:04,655
I mean, who's the boss, huh?
Huh? Tony Danza? No.

1486
01:20:04,755 --> 01:20:06,255
I don't think so.
It's you.

1487
01:20:06,355 --> 01:20:07,455
It's your show,
and I just...

1488
01:20:10,154 --> 01:20:12,654
I just... you know,
feel like maybe...

1489
01:20:12,754 --> 01:20:15,254
I deserve another shot here.

1490
01:20:20,254 --> 01:20:21,754
Well, hi, Lelaina.

1491
01:20:21,789 --> 01:20:23,219
Hi.

1492
01:20:23,254 --> 01:20:24,754
What, is there a frog
in your throat...

1493
01:20:24,789 --> 01:20:26,253
or are you just glad
to see me?

1494
01:20:26,353 --> 01:20:28,253
Hi, Mike. Thanks
for coming down, man.

1495
01:20:28,288 --> 01:20:29,853
No hard feelings.

1496
01:20:37,653 --> 01:20:39,453
Lelaina, you're looking
a little peaked.

1497
01:20:40,753 --> 01:20:42,017
Yeah. Are you OK?

1498
01:20:42,052 --> 01:20:43,717
She's fine.
She's fine.

1499
01:20:43,752 --> 01:20:45,352
She's just had
too many Diet Cokes today.

1500
01:20:45,452 --> 01:20:47,852
Yeah, this girl
is cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs.

1501
01:20:47,952 --> 01:20:49,252
Ha.

1502
01:20:50,952 --> 01:20:53,252
So, are you gonna
tell him, or am I?

1503
01:21:04,751 --> 01:21:08,751
Could you excuse me?
Could I talk to you?

1504
01:21:14,750 --> 01:21:16,050
Hi.

1505
01:21:19,550 --> 01:21:21,750
You want to tell me what
the hell he's doing here?

1506
01:21:21,785 --> 01:21:23,850
I wanted to talk to you.

1507
01:21:23,950 --> 01:21:25,715
What the hell do you care?

1508
01:21:25,750 --> 01:21:27,750
You totally bailed on me
this morning.

1509
01:21:27,785 --> 01:21:29,249
I panicked. It happens.

1510
01:21:29,349 --> 01:21:31,749
I thought we could
work it out, you know.

1511
01:21:31,849 --> 01:21:35,549
I mean, I don't know if now
is the right time for us.

1512
01:21:35,584 --> 01:21:39,249
Look, I meant everything
that I said to you last night.

1513
01:21:39,349 --> 01:21:40,714
Don't look at me like that.

1514
01:21:40,749 --> 01:21:43,249
Don't look at me like that.
That's not what I'm saying.

1515
01:21:43,284 --> 01:21:45,748
I'm not saying I...

1516
01:21:45,848 --> 01:21:48,413
Look, you are the only woman...

1517
01:21:48,448 --> 01:21:50,248
that I could ever
commit myself to.

1518
01:21:50,348 --> 01:21:52,748
So what?
Do I get a medal?

1519
01:21:52,848 --> 01:21:55,848
I win the big commitment
cook-off, and you just run away?

1520
01:21:55,948 --> 01:21:58,748
I knew this was gonna happen!
I knew this was gonna happen!

1521
01:21:58,848 --> 01:22:00,847
I don't want to lose you.

1522
01:22:00,947 --> 01:22:04,447
I've never been in an experience
like this before.

1523
01:22:05,847 --> 01:22:09,547
I've never had sex with somebody
that I loved before.

1524
01:22:10,947 --> 01:22:13,412
Oh, well, congratulations,
Troy Dyer.

1525
01:22:13,447 --> 01:22:15,746
Welcome to the world
of the emotionally immature.

1526
01:22:15,781 --> 01:22:17,911
It's a really nice place
to visit.

1527
01:22:17,946 --> 01:22:20,211
Hey, you may run into Michael.
He lives here.

1528
01:22:20,246 --> 01:22:22,346
Oh, yeah, right. Michael.
Michael. He's so mature...

1529
01:22:22,381 --> 01:22:24,663
because he lets you navigate
that entire relationship.

1530
01:22:24,698 --> 01:22:26,946
Well, I'm sorry, Lelaina,
but you can't navigate me.

1531
01:22:26,981 --> 01:22:28,963
I might do mean things,
and I might hurt you...

1532
01:22:28,998 --> 01:22:30,945
and I might run away
without your permission...

1533
01:22:30,980 --> 01:22:32,410
and you might hate me forever.

1534
01:22:32,445 --> 01:22:34,595
And I know that that scares
the shit out of you...

1535
01:22:34,630 --> 01:22:36,745
because I'm the only
real thing that you have.

1536
01:22:38,445 --> 01:22:41,945
Yeah? Well, that ain't
real much.

1537
01:22:41,980 --> 01:22:44,445
One, two, three, four.

1538
01:22:45,945 --> 01:22:47,644
Hey, Troy, man, you're on.

1539
01:22:57,444 --> 01:22:58,809
Michael, I'm sorry...

1540
01:22:58,844 --> 01:23:00,744
Listen, I'm sorry, all right?
That's what this is all about.

1541
01:23:01,943 --> 01:23:03,343
This one's for you, Lainie.

1542
01:23:17,942 --> 01:23:19,942
Why can't I get just one kiss?

1543
01:23:20,042 --> 01:23:22,007
Why can't I get just one kiss?

1544
01:23:22,042 --> 01:23:24,142
You told me there'd be some
things that I wouldn't miss

1545
01:23:24,177 --> 01:23:25,642
But I looked at your pants

1546
01:23:25,677 --> 01:23:26,842
And I need a kiss

1547
01:23:26,942 --> 01:23:30,842
Why can't I get just one screw?

1548
01:23:31,042 --> 01:23:33,406
Believe me, I'd know
what to do

1549
01:23:33,441 --> 01:23:35,341
But something won't let me
make love to you

1550
01:23:35,376 --> 01:23:37,941
Why can't I get just one ah?

1551
01:23:38,041 --> 01:23:40,141
Why can't I get just one ah?

1552
01:23:54,540 --> 01:23:56,540
Oh, nice job. Very well done.
Really good.

1553
01:23:56,575 --> 01:23:59,005
I don't want to hear it
from you.

1554
01:23:59,040 --> 01:24:02,040
Yeah? Well, I forgot I'm not
qualified to talk to you.

1555
01:24:02,075 --> 01:24:03,905
I'm sorry I can't be Mister...

1556
01:24:03,940 --> 01:24:06,539
Hey, look at me.
I'm Buddha on the mountaintop.

1557
01:24:06,639 --> 01:24:09,039
You know what you are, man?
You what what you remind me of?

1558
01:24:09,074 --> 01:24:12,004
You're like that guy,
you know, with the...

1559
01:24:12,039 --> 01:24:14,539
with the hat and the bells
and the little, you know...

1560
01:24:14,574 --> 01:24:15,839
The court jester.

1561
01:24:15,939 --> 01:24:18,039
Yeah, right. Where everything's
so easy to laugh at...

1562
01:24:18,074 --> 01:24:21,038
from a safe distance
back in Clever-Clever Land.

1563
01:24:21,073 --> 01:24:23,703
You know what happens to him?

1564
01:24:23,738 --> 01:24:26,038
They find his skull in a grave,
and they go...

1565
01:24:26,073 --> 01:24:29,338
"Oh, I knew him,
and he was funny. "

1566
01:24:29,438 --> 01:24:33,538
And the guy, the court jester,
dies all by himself.

1567
01:24:35,038 --> 01:24:37,237
Where'd you hear that,
a Renaissance festival?

1568
01:24:42,537 --> 01:24:45,237
Besides, everyone dies
all by himself.

1569
01:24:53,136 --> 01:24:55,036
If you really believe that...

1570
01:24:56,636 --> 01:24:59,336
Who are you looking for
out here?

1571
01:25:18,935 --> 01:25:24,834
You say you want

1572
01:25:24,934 --> 01:25:29,734
Diamonds on a ring of gold

1573
01:25:29,769 --> 01:25:34,899
You say you want

1574
01:25:34,934 --> 01:25:39,983
Your story to remain untold

1575
01:25:40,018 --> 01:25:45,033
But all the promises we make

1576
01:25:45,133 --> 01:25:50,433
From the cradle to the grave

1577
01:25:50,468 --> 01:25:58,432
When all I want is you

1578
01:26:05,832 --> 01:26:11,396
You say you'll give me

1579
01:26:11,431 --> 01:26:16,281
A highway with no one on it

1580
01:26:16,316 --> 01:26:21,273
Treasure just to look upon it

1581
01:26:21,308 --> 01:26:26,230
All the riches in the night

1582
01:26:26,265 --> 01:26:32,230
You say you'll give me

1583
01:26:32,430 --> 01:26:37,330
Eyes in a moon of blindness

1584
01:26:37,365 --> 01:26:41,746
A river in a time of dryness

1585
01:26:41,781 --> 01:26:46,129
A harbour in the tempest

1586
01:26:46,229 --> 01:26:52,029
But all the promises we make

1587
01:26:52,129 --> 01:26:57,728
From the cradle to the grave

1588
01:26:57,763 --> 01:27:04,628
When all I want is you

1589
01:27:31,426 --> 01:27:32,526
Hello.

1590
01:27:34,126 --> 01:27:35,591
Hello?

1591
01:27:35,626 --> 01:27:48,392
All I want is you

1592
01:27:48,427 --> 01:27:53,625
All I want is you...

1593
01:28:16,823 --> 01:28:19,723
- Hey, Lainie. This is Lance.
- Hi.

1594
01:28:19,823 --> 01:28:23,723
Um... I just need to know
if he's OK.

1595
01:28:23,823 --> 01:28:25,323
Huh?

1596
01:28:26,823 --> 01:28:30,722
OK. All I know is
he went back to Chicago...

1597
01:28:30,822 --> 01:28:32,322
alone.

1598
01:28:34,822 --> 01:28:37,822
I'm not supposed
to know that, am I?

1599
01:29:02,420 --> 01:29:03,820
Shit.

1600
01:29:24,019 --> 01:29:25,819
Shit.

1601
01:29:33,818 --> 01:29:35,518
Hi.

1602
01:29:35,718 --> 01:29:38,818
I was wondering if I could talk
to you for a minute...

1603
01:29:38,853 --> 01:29:40,318
before you go.

1604
01:29:45,318 --> 01:29:49,917
See, the thing is that, um...

1605
01:29:53,417 --> 01:29:55,382
Well...

1606
01:29:55,417 --> 01:29:57,382
my dad died.

1607
01:29:57,417 --> 01:29:59,217
Oh, god, Troy. I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

1608
01:29:59,417 --> 01:30:01,117
No. It...

1609
01:30:02,617 --> 01:30:05,881
What happened was that, um...

1610
01:30:05,916 --> 01:30:11,916
I kind of got this arcane
glimpse at the universe.

1611
01:30:12,016 --> 01:30:16,416
And the best thing
that I can say about that is...

1612
01:30:23,015 --> 01:30:25,015
I don't know. I...

1613
01:30:29,515 --> 01:30:34,015
I have this...
this planet of regret...

1614
01:30:34,050 --> 01:30:36,014
sitting on my shoulders.

1615
01:30:38,014 --> 01:30:43,014
And you have no idea how much
I wish that I could go back...

1616
01:30:43,049 --> 01:30:45,814
to that morning
after we made love...

1617
01:30:45,849 --> 01:30:48,614
and do everything different.

1618
01:30:50,014 --> 01:30:53,213
But I know that I can't, so...

1619
01:30:54,513 --> 01:30:58,013
I thought that I would come here
and tell you something.

1620
01:30:59,513 --> 01:31:02,513
And what I wanted to tell you...

1621
01:31:02,548 --> 01:31:04,478
was that I love you...

1622
01:31:04,513 --> 01:31:08,612
and, uh... just wanted to
make sure that that was clear...

1623
01:31:08,647 --> 01:31:11,112
so that there wasn't
any confusion.

1624
01:31:17,012 --> 01:31:18,512
Um...

1625
01:31:19,512 --> 01:31:22,511
So, anyway, uh...

1626
01:31:24,011 --> 01:31:25,676
Where are you going?

1627
01:31:25,711 --> 01:31:29,111
I was going to look for you.

1628
01:31:30,611 --> 01:31:32,111
What for?

1629
01:31:35,611 --> 01:31:40,710
Just... wanted to see
if you were OK.

1630
01:31:47,210 --> 01:31:50,510
Well, I had
a shitty week, you know.

1631
01:32:28,907 --> 01:32:31,807
A froggy went
a- courting, and he did ride

1632
01:32:31,907 --> 01:32:36,207
With a sword and a pistol
by his side

1633
01:32:36,242 --> 01:32:41,206
Uh-huh, uh-huh, mmm-hmm-hmm

1634
01:32:42,706 --> 01:32:45,706
Well, he rode right up
to Miss Mousie's door...

1635
01:32:48,706 --> 01:32:50,171
At the beep...

1636
01:32:50,206 --> 01:32:52,206
please leave your name, number,
and a brief justification...

1637
01:32:52,241 --> 01:32:53,671
for the ontological necessity...

1638
01:32:53,706 --> 01:32:55,705
of modern man's
existential dilemma...

1639
01:32:55,740 --> 01:32:58,170
and we'll get back to you.

1640
01:32:58,205 --> 01:33:00,005
Uh, Lelaina,
this is your dad.

1641
01:33:00,105 --> 01:33:01,955
Give me a call
when you get this.

1642
01:33:01,990 --> 01:33:03,770
I need you to explain something.

1643
01:33:03,805 --> 01:33:06,705
I just got a nine-hundred-dollar
bill on my gas card.

1644
01:33:09,205 --> 01:33:15,604
If we should fall,
love will catch us every time

1645
01:33:15,704 --> 01:33:19,304
I hear you call,
I will run

1646
01:33:20,904 --> 01:33:26,304
And if the magic
of the adventure overcomes

1647
01:33:26,404 --> 01:33:30,303
We won't cry,
because it could be fun

1648
01:33:30,403 --> 01:33:32,303
What I'm trying to do is
constantly find those people...

1649
01:33:32,403 --> 01:33:35,203
find out what makes them
the best and bring that...

1650
01:33:35,403 --> 01:33:36,703
Tired of getting razzes
for being bald?

1651
01:33:36,903 --> 01:33:38,203
I'm only a young man.

1652
01:33:38,403 --> 01:33:40,403
No more dates
where I've been called old man.

1653
01:33:45,402 --> 01:33:48,002
Roy, why are you
doing this to me?

1654
01:33:48,102 --> 01:33:49,567
I know we can be happy together.

1655
01:33:49,602 --> 01:33:52,452
You'll chill in time.
Right now, I need someone...

1656
01:33:52,487 --> 01:33:55,302
who understands what my music
and the band mean to me.

1657
01:33:55,337 --> 01:33:57,502
But it's just music, Roy.

1658
01:33:57,602 --> 01:34:00,401
I'm a human being
with deep feelings...

1659
01:34:00,436 --> 01:34:03,501
who feels things deeply.

1660
01:34:03,601 --> 01:34:05,866
Music is feeling, babe.

1661
01:34:05,901 --> 01:34:08,401
The band may be a small dream,
but it's the only one I've got.

1662
01:34:08,436 --> 01:34:10,401
I'm Audi 5000.

1663
01:34:13,201 --> 01:34:15,900
Please don't let him
get drunk and drive.

1664
01:34:15,935 --> 01:34:18,767
Won't be very long

1665
01:34:18,802 --> 01:34:21,600
Till I'm going, going, gone

1666
01:34:34,899 --> 01:34:36,899
You say

1667
01:34:37,899 --> 01:34:40,899
I only hear what I want to

1668
01:34:46,598 --> 01:34:48,898
You say

1669
01:34:50,098 --> 01:34:52,898
I talk so all the time

1670
01:34:52,998 --> 01:34:54,398
So?

1671
01:34:58,398 --> 01:35:01,297
And I thought
what I felt was simple

1672
01:35:01,332 --> 01:35:04,197
And I thought
that I don't belong

1673
01:35:04,232 --> 01:35:07,162
And now that I am leaving

1674
01:35:07,197 --> 01:35:09,497
Now I know
that I did something wrong

1675
01:35:09,597 --> 01:35:11,197
'Cause I missed you

1676
01:35:13,397 --> 01:35:17,596
Yeah, yeah, I missed you

1677
01:35:22,596 --> 01:35:24,696
And you say

1678
01:35:26,096 --> 01:35:28,061
I only hear what I want to

1679
01:35:28,096 --> 01:35:30,596
I don't listen hard,
I don't pay attention

1680
01:35:30,631 --> 01:35:32,195
To the distance
that you're running

1681
01:35:32,295 --> 01:35:33,860
Or to anyone, anywhere

1682
01:35:33,895 --> 01:35:36,695
I don't understand
if you really care

1683
01:35:36,795 --> 01:35:40,595
I'm only hearing negative,
no, no, no, no

1684
01:35:40,630 --> 01:35:42,560
No...

1685
01:35:42,595 --> 01:35:46,095
So I turned the radio on,
I turned the radio up

1686
01:35:46,130 --> 01:35:48,559
And this woman
was singing my song

1687
01:35:48,594 --> 01:35:51,844
The lover's in love,
and the other's run away

1688
01:35:51,879 --> 01:35:54,536
The lover is crying
'cause the other won't stay

1689
01:35:54,571 --> 01:35:57,194
Some of us hover
when we weep for the other

1690
01:35:57,294 --> 01:36:00,294
Who was dying since
the day they were born, well

1691
01:36:00,329 --> 01:36:03,293
Well, this is not that,
I think that I'm throwing

1692
01:36:03,328 --> 01:36:06,558
But I'm thrown

1693
01:36:06,593 --> 01:36:09,093
And I thought I'd live forever,
but now I'm not so sure

1694
01:36:09,128 --> 01:36:11,093
You try to tell me
that I'm clever

1695
01:36:11,128 --> 01:36:13,293
But that won't take me anyhow

1696
01:36:13,328 --> 01:36:17,093
Or anywhere with you

1697
01:36:19,092 --> 01:36:22,092
You said that I was naive and

1698
01:36:22,127 --> 01:36:25,057
I thought
that I was strong, no

1699
01:36:25,092 --> 01:36:28,092
I thought, hey, I can leave,
I can leave, though

1700
01:36:28,192 --> 01:36:30,092
But now I know
that I was wrong

1701
01:36:30,192 --> 01:36:32,092
Because I missed you

1702
01:36:34,292 --> 01:36:38,791
Yeah, I missed you

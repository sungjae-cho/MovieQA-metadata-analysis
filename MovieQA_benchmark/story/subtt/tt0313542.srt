00:00:59,807 --> 00:01:02,526
<i>New Orleans, good morning.</i>
<i>It's Rod Ryan with you.</i>

2
00:01:02,687 --> 00:01:05,121
<i>Coming up, tickets for the</i>
<i>Voodoo Fest coming to...</i>

3
00:01:05,287 --> 00:01:08,996
<i>- to the banks of the Mississippi,</i>
<i>from Baton Rouge to Bayou Boutin...</i>

4
00:01:09,167 --> 00:01:11,123
<i>... this is Hooks checking</i>
<i>news headlines.</i>

5
00:01:11,287 --> 00:01:13,357
<i>- Good day to be in New Orleans...</i>

6
00:01:16,767 --> 00:01:18,758
<i>How's the birthday boy?</i>

7
00:01:23,327 --> 00:01:26,717
<i>- This is for Mommy.</i>
<i>- Thank you, sweetheart.</i>

8
00:01:26,887 --> 00:01:29,242
<i>- Look at Grandpa. Say hi.</i>
<i>- Open my present.</i>

9
00:01:30,447 --> 00:01:31,721
<i>Want to open a present?</i>

10
00:01:37,927 --> 00:01:39,804
- Good morning, Mr. Wood.
- Morning.

11
00:01:39,967 --> 00:01:41,878
Paper.

12
00:01:42,447 --> 00:01:44,005
Thank you.
How was your weekend?

13
00:01:44,167 --> 00:01:47,159
- Great. How was yours?
- Very nice. How are the kids?

14
00:01:47,327 --> 00:01:49,079
Great.

15
00:01:49,247 --> 00:01:52,045
<i>Magic trick. Henry!</i>

16
00:01:53,167 --> 00:01:54,600
- Jacob.
- Ted. Good Morning.

17
00:01:54,767 --> 00:01:56,439
- It's happening.
- What's happening?

18
00:01:56,607 --> 00:01:59,758
Does your car have a radio?
Greenspan's speech was delayed.

19
00:01:59,927 --> 00:02:03,476
Rumor is he's sick. Looks like end
of the world is factored into prices.

20
00:02:03,647 --> 00:02:05,956
Everyone in the conference room
in 10 minutes.

21
00:02:06,127 --> 00:02:10,564
Deborah, I need you for five minutes.
Ted, it's Monday. There'll be a Tuesday.

22
00:02:11,607 --> 00:02:14,838
You have a call about the antitrust
approvals with Harry at 11.

23
00:02:15,007 --> 00:02:16,884
Close the door, please.

24
00:02:20,847 --> 00:02:23,042
How'd Henry's party go?

25
00:02:24,087 --> 00:02:26,203
- Terrific. He had a great time.
- Good.

26
00:02:29,167 --> 00:02:30,885
I have a problem.

27
00:02:31,647 --> 00:02:33,205
Okay. What is it?

28
00:02:45,527 --> 00:02:47,324
He taught me a song for his birthday.

29
00:02:47,487 --> 00:02:51,605
I have to sing it for him tonight
at bedtime, and I can't think what it is.

30
00:02:51,767 --> 00:02:54,076
Sing a little more and we'll figure it out.

31
00:03:13,247 --> 00:03:14,521
What the hell was that?

32
00:03:15,647 --> 00:03:18,320
- Oh, my God!
- Call 911!

33
00:03:19,967 --> 00:03:22,561
<i>- 911.</i>
- I want to report a shooting.

34
00:03:31,407 --> 00:03:34,763
- Get behind the desk and stay there!
<i>- Ma 'am?</i>

35
00:03:34,927 --> 00:03:36,963
The Laurel Morgan Building.

36
00:03:37,127 --> 00:03:38,879
- Third floor.
<i>- How many are injured?</i>

37
00:03:39,047 --> 00:03:42,244
I don't know. I don't know
how many... No, stay with me!

38
00:03:42,527 --> 00:03:45,360
- God! They put me on hold. Hello?
- Oh, shit.

39
00:03:46,047 --> 00:03:48,436
- Come on, somebody...
- Calm down.

40
00:03:48,607 --> 00:03:51,883
- Can you see anything?
- It'll be fine. I promise.

41
00:03:52,087 --> 00:03:53,566
Hello?

42
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:56,000
Hello?

43
00:04:02,887 --> 00:04:05,959
Come on.
Please send somebody.

44
00:04:07,647 --> 00:04:10,036
Pick up. Please pick up.

45
00:04:44,007 --> 00:04:47,363
- Good morning, Mr. Pulaski.
- Morning, Nick.

46
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:50,280
Need some help with that?

47
00:04:50,447 --> 00:04:54,201
The bilge ring keeps crapping out,
blocking up the damn pump. I got it.

48
00:04:54,367 --> 00:04:57,040
Last time you nearly took out
every sink in the Quarter.

49
00:04:57,207 --> 00:05:00,165
That was those kids messing
with the water main.

50
00:05:01,047 --> 00:05:04,323
- You should really quit those things.
- What for?

51
00:05:34,687 --> 00:05:37,520
Christmas comes a little early this year.

52
00:05:43,727 --> 00:05:46,719
There's our boy.
So, what do you say?

53
00:05:46,887 --> 00:05:51,403
- Does he stop in for coffee and a cruller?
- Let's give him a cruller.

54
00:05:51,567 --> 00:05:56,038
- Bingo! We have a winner.
- I can smell the fried dough over here.

55
00:05:56,207 --> 00:05:58,198
And there he is.

56
00:05:59,447 --> 00:06:01,802
Breakfast of champions, right there.

57
00:06:07,287 --> 00:06:09,562
We're losing him. I'll take
just a couple more.

58
00:06:09,727 --> 00:06:12,924
Say goodbye to Mr. Nicholas Easter.

59
00:06:13,487 --> 00:06:15,125
Who's next on the hit parade?

60
00:06:25,567 --> 00:06:26,886
Hi.

61
00:06:29,247 --> 00:06:31,203
Can I look at that candle?

62
00:06:32,607 --> 00:06:34,438
No, I'm sorry, the red one.

63
00:06:34,607 --> 00:06:38,759
Just to the left of that scary pentacle
and the jar of bloodroot.

64
00:06:38,927 --> 00:06:40,246
Right there.

65
00:06:45,727 --> 00:06:47,479
Thank you. What'd you say?

66
00:06:47,647 --> 00:06:50,525
She's cajun. I told her you wanted
the St. Nicholas candle.

67
00:06:50,687 --> 00:06:53,155
- Is that what you wanted?
- That's the one.

68
00:06:56,967 --> 00:06:59,083
What happened right there?
What did she say?

69
00:06:59,247 --> 00:07:02,159
She said you're nice-Iooking,
but she doesn't trust you.

70
00:07:02,687 --> 00:07:04,439
She didn't say that, did she?

71
00:07:04,607 --> 00:07:07,167
You know what it is?

72
00:07:07,727 --> 00:07:10,844
Jury duty.
I got a summons in the mail.

73
00:07:11,087 --> 00:07:14,397
- I was trying to pray out of it.
- Where's your sense of civic duty?

74
00:07:15,887 --> 00:07:18,117
I flunked civics.

75
00:07:18,287 --> 00:07:23,441
- Do you have any other tips?
- I would go with a St. Catherine candle.

76
00:07:23,767 --> 00:07:25,041
What does she do?

77
00:07:25,207 --> 00:07:28,040
She's the patron saint
of unmarried women and jurors.

78
00:07:28,407 --> 00:07:30,125
- Really?
- Really.

79
00:07:31,007 --> 00:07:33,237
That's not what
that candle really is, is it?

80
00:07:47,407 --> 00:07:51,320
- This your first time in New Orleans?
- No, no.

81
00:07:51,487 --> 00:07:55,924
- I've been here a number of times.
- I had you pegged as a first-timer.

82
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:58,280
Is that right?

83
00:07:58,527 --> 00:08:00,245
Yeah.

84
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:09,443
- How's your mother?
- Excuse me?

85
00:08:10,247 --> 00:08:13,876
- She feeling better?
- How do you know about my mother?

86
00:08:14,047 --> 00:08:16,720
She was in the hospital.
Now you care for her at home.

87
00:08:17,807 --> 00:08:20,685
- She had a stroke.
- Your wife wants to put her in a home...

88
00:08:20,847 --> 00:08:24,601
<i>...but</i> you're feeling guilty about that.
You've checked out a few of <i>them...</i>

89
00:08:24,767 --> 00:08:27,645
<i>...and</i> it doesn't feel
like the Christian thing to do.

90
00:08:27,807 --> 00:08:30,526
My advice, reconsider the home.

91
00:08:30,847 --> 00:08:34,078
Better an unhappy mother
than an unfriendly wife.

92
00:08:36,407 --> 00:08:37,681
I'm up here on the right.

93
00:08:41,447 --> 00:08:44,325
- The same thing with guns
and Vicksburg Firearms.

94
00:08:44,727 --> 00:08:46,957
The only thing
that's gonna win this <i>case...</i>

95
00:08:47,127 --> 00:08:50,403
...is because for the first time,
we got a gun company ex-executive...

96
00:08:50,567 --> 00:08:52,956
...who's gonna go up
against his former employer...

97
00:08:53,127 --> 00:08:55,925
...and with good conscience,
he's gonna testify for us.

98
00:08:56,087 --> 00:09:00,478
I promised Celeste that I would win it for
her and all the others that died that day.

99
00:09:00,647 --> 00:09:03,878
You're gonna make history, celeste.
We're gonna do it together.

100
00:09:04,047 --> 00:09:06,277
Thank you for your courage.

101
00:09:14,087 --> 00:09:16,442
We got the Strickland SUV
case at noon.

102
00:09:16,607 --> 00:09:19,360
And celeste, I'll see you
and your son at Arno's at 6.

103
00:09:19,527 --> 00:09:21,518
- As long as we don't...
- Nothing about the case.

104
00:09:21,687 --> 00:09:24,884
This is dinner with you and Henry.
Got time to see her to her car?

105
00:09:25,047 --> 00:09:26,605
- Absolutely.
- Thank you.

106
00:09:26,767 --> 00:09:28,439
- Mr. Rohr.
- Yeah.

107
00:09:28,727 --> 00:09:30,718
Lawrence Green.
Lindus, Hostetler...

108
00:09:30,887 --> 00:09:34,323
Hostetler. Yes, jury consultants,
New York City.

109
00:09:34,487 --> 00:09:36,637
Philadelphia.
Thank you for meeting with me.

110
00:09:36,807 --> 00:09:39,401
Guess how many phone calls
and letters I get...

111
00:09:39,567 --> 00:09:42,081
...from expert jury consultants
such as yourself.

112
00:09:42,247 --> 00:09:44,363
- I can imagine, sir.
- Go on, take a guess.

113
00:09:44,527 --> 00:09:46,199
I appreciate you inviting me here.

114
00:09:46,367 --> 00:09:49,723
- This is more important now. Which one?
- I'm sorry?

115
00:09:49,887 --> 00:09:52,003
I'm off to court.
This is the striped.

116
00:09:52,167 --> 00:09:55,637
- Non-striped? Striped? Non-striped?
- The striped matches your jacket.

117
00:09:55,807 --> 00:09:57,877
Yours is striped because
you're from New York.

118
00:09:58,047 --> 00:10:00,481
- Philadelphia.
- I'm gonna go with the non-striped.

119
00:10:00,647 --> 00:10:03,480
As a clever jury consultant,
you should know...

120
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:07,560
<i>...that</i> jurors down here don't trust
a lawyer who's too nattily turned out.

121
00:10:07,727 --> 00:10:10,161
- How familiar are you with my case?
- Very, sir.

122
00:10:10,327 --> 00:10:12,283
- You think it's a strong case?
- Yes, sir.

123
00:10:12,447 --> 00:10:16,838
- Do you think it's a winning case?
- People don't win gun cases, Mr. Rohr.

124
00:10:17,887 --> 00:10:19,764
I think I can help you with that, sir.

125
00:10:21,647 --> 00:10:23,478
There's gotta be another
commuter flight.

126
00:10:23,647 --> 00:10:26,207
Can you try one in Richmond
or Atlanta?

127
00:10:27,567 --> 00:10:29,956
I gotta call you back. He's here.

128
00:10:32,127 --> 00:10:35,358
You represent the widow of a man
shot by a Vicksburg Firearms gun.

129
00:10:35,527 --> 00:10:37,677
They're finding out things about <i>jurors...</i>

130
00:10:37,847 --> 00:10:39,997
- ...their spouses don't know.
- Is that right?

131
00:10:40,167 --> 00:10:42,840
And the word is the defense
has retained...

132
00:10:43,007 --> 00:10:45,362
...Rankin Fitch as their
lead jury consultant.

133
00:10:45,527 --> 00:10:47,085
Rankin Fitch?

134
00:10:47,247 --> 00:10:48,726
- You don't...?
- I know who he is.

135
00:10:51,807 --> 00:10:56,278
- Mr. Fitch, how was your flight?
- Fine. We up and running, Miss Monroe?

136
00:10:56,447 --> 00:11:00,725
We are. Kaufman's inside with Birk,
and the kid from MIT, Lamb, is here.

137
00:11:00,887 --> 00:11:02,923
What about Broussard,
forensic linguistics?

138
00:11:03,087 --> 00:11:06,363
Out of Rochester.
He missed his flight. He'll be here by 3.

139
00:11:06,527 --> 00:11:08,404
- Who's our backup?
- He'll be here by 3.

140
00:11:08,567 --> 00:11:11,764
- Who is our backup?
- Levon Raines out of Dallas.

141
00:11:11,927 --> 00:11:16,159
Call Mr. Broussard. Tell him
his service is no longer required.

142
00:11:16,327 --> 00:11:19,125
- See what time Raines can be here.
- Yes, sir.

143
00:11:19,287 --> 00:11:20,766
Mr. Fitch.

144
00:11:28,767 --> 00:11:30,837
Tell me why I need a jury consultant.

145
00:11:31,007 --> 00:11:33,521
Fitch will scientifically
pick jurors predisposed...

146
00:11:33,687 --> 00:11:37,441
...in his favor by using surveillance,
wiretaps, psych profiles, graphology...

147
00:11:37,607 --> 00:11:39,598
- Where's my car?
- Where you parked it.

148
00:11:39,767 --> 00:11:42,839
- We're going together.
- Sir, I have a master's in <i>psychology...</i>

149
00:11:43,007 --> 00:11:47,762
...from the University of Chicago. I know
handwriting. I know this stuff, I do.

150
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:53,675
Delores Kinnerly, registered Democrat,
46 years of age, unmarried...

151
00:11:53,847 --> 00:11:56,998
...occupational therapist,
devout cat lover.

152
00:11:57,167 --> 00:11:59,522
Look how she turns
from the man walking his dog.

153
00:11:59,687 --> 00:12:03,839
- She's self-conscious about her weight.
- Maybe she just hates dogs.

154
00:12:04,927 --> 00:12:06,155
- Good morning.
- Morning.

155
00:12:06,327 --> 00:12:08,124
Freeze that, Mr. Lamb.

156
00:12:11,887 --> 00:12:13,525
We love fat women, people.

157
00:12:15,047 --> 00:12:17,402
They're tight-fisted, unsympathetic.

158
00:12:17,567 --> 00:12:22,436
I want her on my jury. Let's find 11
more jurors and three alternates like her.

159
00:12:22,687 --> 00:12:25,838
- Who's next?
- Jerry Fernandez, 40, Puerto Rican...

160
00:12:26,007 --> 00:12:27,406
...works for a moving company.

161
00:12:27,567 --> 00:12:29,683
<i>I got 35 years experience</i>
<i>in courtrooms...</i>

162
00:12:29,847 --> 00:12:33,203
...and my instincts for picking juries
have served me nicely so far.

163
00:12:33,367 --> 00:12:37,280
- I wanna thank you for your time.
- I flew down here on my own dime.

164
00:12:37,447 --> 00:12:39,403
- Why?
- Because I...

165
00:12:39,967 --> 00:12:43,516
- Because I believe in this case.
- Why?

166
00:12:45,527 --> 00:12:48,883
- I believe in a world without guns.
- That's very sweet, but naive.

167
00:12:53,687 --> 00:12:56,997
- Thirty percent.
- I'm sorry. Excuse me?

168
00:12:57,247 --> 00:13:01,126
Thirty percent of your usual fee.
You're hired, strictly probationary status.

169
00:13:01,287 --> 00:13:04,324
- You don't wanna check out my résumé?
- Already did.

170
00:13:04,487 --> 00:13:06,478
It's impressive.

171
00:13:09,287 --> 00:13:10,879
<i>- Here's your thing.</i>
<i>- What do you got?</i>

172
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:12,925
- "The following are exempt:
- I read it.

173
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:16,636
- Not a resident of New Orleans..."
- That won't work. What am I gonna say?

174
00:13:16,807 --> 00:13:18,718
I'm gonna tell them
I'll pack and leave?

175
00:13:18,887 --> 00:13:22,357
Number two. Pack up and leave?
You ain't got nothing to pack.

176
00:13:22,527 --> 00:13:25,485
No, it's true. They own you.
One thing you can do.

177
00:13:25,647 --> 00:13:27,205
Leave the country.

178
00:13:27,367 --> 00:13:29,756
- Why am I gonna leave?
- Church convention.

179
00:13:29,927 --> 00:13:32,885
Sex change. You're leaving
because you're becoming a woman.

180
00:13:33,607 --> 00:13:36,167
- You own a goat farm.
- This thing is a disaster.

181
00:13:36,327 --> 00:13:37,919
I got my life and work.

182
00:13:38,087 --> 00:13:41,557
- And I got my training. The Challenge.
- Oh, wait a sec.

183
00:13:41,847 --> 00:13:44,805
- You could claim hardship.
- It's 8 weeks away. I can't do it.

184
00:13:44,967 --> 00:13:47,606
- I can't do it.
- You got the challenge. You can't go.

185
00:13:47,767 --> 00:13:51,316
Hold on, check this. "If you have
been convicted of a felony..."

186
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:53,239
Have you been convicted of a felony?

187
00:13:53,407 --> 00:13:55,318
- No.
- You should commit a felony.

188
00:13:55,847 --> 00:13:58,236
- Commit a crime.
- Are you serious?

189
00:13:58,407 --> 00:14:00,477
It doesn't have to be a bad crime.

190
00:14:00,647 --> 00:14:04,276
- I should commit a crime?
- You're asking to get out of it, right?

191
00:14:04,447 --> 00:14:06,278
You registered to vote.

192
00:14:06,447 --> 00:14:09,598
If you register to vote,
then they got you in the jury pool.

193
00:14:10,007 --> 00:14:11,884
We need to de-register him.

194
00:14:12,047 --> 00:14:14,720
<i>One day, I'm gonna organize,</i>
<i>throw half this stuff away.</i>

195
00:14:15,167 --> 00:14:17,362
<i>What's that, Walther PPK?</i>
<i>That's a nice piece.</i>

196
00:14:17,527 --> 00:14:20,166
<i>That's the same gun James Bond uses.</i>
<i>You know that?</i>

197
00:14:20,327 --> 00:14:22,841
<i>Really? You can 't be too safe</i>
<i>these days.</i>

198
00:14:23,007 --> 00:14:26,124
<i>- Walking on the streets, all alone.</i>
- Smooth, Maxine.

199
00:14:26,327 --> 00:14:29,444
<i>It's easier to find an honest firearm</i>
<i>these days than a good man.</i>

200
00:14:30,207 --> 00:14:33,040
<i>- Know how to use it?</i>
<i>- My brother took me to the dump once.</i>

201
00:14:33,207 --> 00:14:35,163
<i>Let me take you down</i>
<i>to the firing range.</i>

202
00:14:35,367 --> 00:14:37,483
- Thattaboy.
<i>- I'll show you how to shoot.</i>

203
00:14:37,647 --> 00:14:40,719
<i>- I got a few ideas.</i>
<i>- I bet.</i>

204
00:14:40,887 --> 00:14:42,400
Nice job, Maxine.

205
00:14:43,047 --> 00:14:46,005
Frank Herrera, Cuban, 43 years old...

206
00:14:46,167 --> 00:14:49,682
...retired Marine sergeant, served
in Panama and Grenada, twice divorced.

207
00:14:49,847 --> 00:14:51,883
Now he cleans swimming pools.

208
00:14:52,127 --> 00:14:55,005
Fair to say he misses
his former position of authority.

209
00:14:55,167 --> 00:14:58,284
I think Herrera would make
a good foreman. Don't you, Mr. Cable?

210
00:14:58,447 --> 00:15:04,204
I'm only lead counsel for defense. I don't
pretend to know about jury selection.

211
00:15:04,367 --> 00:15:06,323
- Really?
- Really.

212
00:15:06,487 --> 00:15:08,557
- Who's next?
- Nicholas Easter.

213
00:15:08,727 --> 00:15:12,242
Thirty-four, co-manager of Game Trader
in the Esplanade Mall.

214
00:15:12,407 --> 00:15:15,843
- He's gonna love this.
- Watch me hit this lady in the head.

215
00:15:16,007 --> 00:15:18,157
- See how her head explodes?
- It explodes.

216
00:15:18,327 --> 00:15:20,557
<i>Don 't hit her. Hit the bad guy.</i>

217
00:15:20,727 --> 00:15:23,116
<i>- I can try? Show me how to hold it.</i>
<i>- Give it a shot.</i>

218
00:15:24,047 --> 00:15:25,639
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

219
00:15:25,807 --> 00:15:27,957
I threw in this little sniper game.

220
00:15:28,127 --> 00:15:31,722
- I thought you might like it.
- I wrote down my phone number.

221
00:15:31,887 --> 00:15:34,640
<i>Oh, okay. That's a local number.</i>
<i>You're here.</i>

222
00:15:34,807 --> 00:15:36,081
- We're close.
- Right on.

223
00:15:36,247 --> 00:15:37,999
Perfect. I'm Maxine.

224
00:15:38,407 --> 00:15:39,635
<i>I'm Nick Easter.</i>

225
00:15:39,807 --> 00:15:42,037
He calls himself a part-time student.

226
00:15:42,207 --> 00:15:44,846
- At Tulane? City College?
- Currently, nowhere.

227
00:15:45,367 --> 00:15:47,642
So he's lying. Where's he from?

228
00:15:47,807 --> 00:15:49,843
Moved here eight months ago.
Trail's cold.

229
00:15:50,007 --> 00:15:53,238
He dropped out of the sky
like the Archangel Gabriel?

230
00:15:53,407 --> 00:15:57,878
Put him on a jury with Herrera, he's
gonna be doing dog tricks in minutes.

231
00:15:58,047 --> 00:16:02,040
Without reviewing his questionnaire,
a formal Q&A, I can't trust this.

232
00:16:02,207 --> 00:16:04,721
You're only lead counsel
for the defense.

233
00:16:04,887 --> 00:16:07,959
You shouldn't pretend to know much
about jury selection.

234
00:16:08,127 --> 00:16:12,757
Nicholas Easter, he's an entertainer.
He wants to make everybody happy.

235
00:16:12,927 --> 00:16:15,839
Not a bad way to go through life,
making everybody happy.

236
00:16:16,247 --> 00:16:20,798
But in court, it's not that simple.
Somebody always loses.

237
00:16:21,487 --> 00:16:24,240
Just not me. He's a risk.

238
00:16:24,487 --> 00:16:25,761
Let's move on.

239
00:16:26,407 --> 00:16:29,524
<i>The case stems from the shooting death</i>
<i>of stockbroker Jacob Wood...</i>

240
00:16:29,687 --> 00:16:31,040
<i>... two years ago.</i>

241
00:16:31,207 --> 00:16:34,119
Seating a panel won't be easy
in this highly-watched...

242
00:16:34,287 --> 00:16:37,404
...politically-charged trial that begins
with jury selection.

243
00:16:37,567 --> 00:16:39,797
On the defense, Vicksburg Firearms.

244
00:16:39,967 --> 00:16:42,765
Attorneys will begin questioning
potential jurors today...

245
00:16:42,927 --> 00:16:46,237
The gun industry hasn't lost in court,
but the man leading this fight...

246
00:16:46,407 --> 00:16:48,762
...attorney Wendall Rohr,
says it'll be different.

247
00:16:48,927 --> 00:16:51,760
He says this time the gun industry
will pay.

248
00:16:52,647 --> 00:16:55,161
It's not sticking. I need the other tape.

249
00:16:56,927 --> 00:16:58,679
- Know what you're doing?
- Good to go.

250
00:16:58,847 --> 00:17:00,838
Could I get your glasses? Perfect.

251
00:17:01,007 --> 00:17:03,760
Same prescription. The frames
will feel a little heavier.

252
00:17:04,207 --> 00:17:05,720
Come on.

253
00:17:05,887 --> 00:17:08,082
Right side of the table. Keep it square.

254
00:17:08,247 --> 00:17:10,602
Keep it clear. Mr. Cable.

255
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:14,517
I'm gonna be putting
this behind your ear.

256
00:17:14,687 --> 00:17:16,484
- What is that?
- It ain't Dramamine.

257
00:17:16,647 --> 00:17:18,319
Right there. All set.

258
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:20,166
- You done?
- I am.

259
00:17:45,287 --> 00:17:47,198
Mr. Rohr.

260
00:17:51,407 --> 00:17:54,877
- Can you smell that?
- Two-hundred-year-old mahogany.

261
00:17:56,367 --> 00:18:00,804
Furniture polish, cheap cologne
and body odor.

262
00:18:03,407 --> 00:18:05,159
Wendall.

263
00:18:34,007 --> 00:18:37,283
- How you doing? I'm Nick.
- Lydia.

264
00:18:37,927 --> 00:18:40,999
So, what are we supposed to do,
sit here all day? Is that it?

265
00:18:41,167 --> 00:18:44,716
- What do they want us to do?
- I'm sure we can think of something.

266
00:18:45,007 --> 00:18:46,520
All rise.

267
00:18:50,367 --> 00:18:54,804
Oyez, oyez, oyez, civil district court for
the parish of Orleans is now in session.

268
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:57,401
The Honorable Frederick Buford Harkins
presiding.

269
00:18:57,567 --> 00:19:00,035
God save the state
and this honorable court.

270
00:19:00,207 --> 00:19:02,402
Thank you, bailiff.
You may take your seats.

271
00:19:09,407 --> 00:19:11,318
This suit is brought by plaintiffs...

272
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:13,717
Over your left shoulder.
Rankin Fitch, 2:00.

273
00:19:14,087 --> 00:19:16,920
Dark suit. You've heard the myth,
now meet the man.

274
00:19:17,607 --> 00:19:19,325
Quaking in my Florsheims.

275
00:19:20,167 --> 00:19:22,840
Celeste Wood claims
that Vicksburg Firearms is liable...

276
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:27,319
<i>...for</i> her husband's death and seeks
damages for loss of future earnings...

277
00:19:27,487 --> 00:19:30,399
...as well as general damages,
including pain and suffering.

278
00:19:30,567 --> 00:19:32,876
Plaintiff has exercised
her right to a jury trial.

279
00:19:33,047 --> 00:19:37,438
- We are now ready to begin the voir dire.
- Miss Coleman.

280
00:19:37,847 --> 00:19:39,678
- Mrs.
- Mrs. Coleman, excuse me.

281
00:19:39,847 --> 00:19:44,204
I see from your questionnaire that you
have no particular feeling about guns...

282
00:19:44,647 --> 00:19:48,276
- Briefcase on the jury.
- Yes, sir, that's correct.

283
00:19:48,767 --> 00:19:50,962
I don't feel one way
or another about guns...

284
00:19:51,127 --> 00:19:54,836
<i>...but I sure hate to see people get hurt.</i>
<i>- I understand.</i>

285
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:57,805
<i>- Do you or your husband own a gun?</i>
<i>- We do not.</i>

286
00:19:57,967 --> 00:20:00,276
<i>Ever fired a gun for sport?</i>

287
00:20:00,727 --> 00:20:02,797
Or in self-defense?

288
00:20:03,487 --> 00:20:04,761
Shoulder shrug.

289
00:20:04,927 --> 00:20:08,203
She's evaluating the person
asking the question before she answers.

290
00:20:08,367 --> 00:20:10,801
She's telling Rohr exactly
what he wants to hear.

291
00:20:10,967 --> 00:20:13,356
- You think she's lying.
- Not necessarily.

292
00:20:13,527 --> 00:20:16,405
- She knows how to.
- Rikki Coleman, 36 years of age.

293
00:20:16,567 --> 00:20:18,523
Her husband's a Baptist minister.

294
00:20:18,687 --> 00:20:22,362
She's a card-carrying member of the
Sierra Club and a registered Democrat.

295
00:20:22,567 --> 00:20:25,365
I hate Baptists almost
as much as I hate Democrats.

296
00:20:25,527 --> 00:20:27,757
- What else?
- She had an abortion two years ago.

297
00:20:27,927 --> 00:20:30,521
- And? And?
- The guy holding her hand at the clinic...

298
00:20:30,687 --> 00:20:32,678
...not the Baptist minister.

299
00:20:36,927 --> 00:20:39,487
Tone of voice, body language,
she's got an open mind.

300
00:20:39,647 --> 00:20:42,559
She's gonna be fair
and sympathetic to Mrs. Wood.

301
00:20:42,727 --> 00:20:45,321
Mr. Rohr, do you wish
to exercise challenge for cause?

302
00:20:45,487 --> 00:20:49,036
- No, Your Honor. We accept this juror.
- Mr. Cable?

303
00:20:49,207 --> 00:20:51,846
- Take her. Take her.
- No objections here, Your Honor.

304
00:20:52,127 --> 00:20:54,083
Enter Mrs. Coleman as a juror.

305
00:20:54,247 --> 00:20:57,239
<i>I'm co-manager of Circle Foods.</i>
<i>It's a local grocery chain.</i>

306
00:20:57,447 --> 00:20:59,358
I've been living here about 14 years.

307
00:21:00,807 --> 00:21:03,560
Circle Foods. Take him, Mr. Cable.

308
00:21:04,567 --> 00:21:08,116
- We accept this juror, Your Honor.
- Mr. Rohr?

309
00:21:11,167 --> 00:21:13,522
- No objections, Your Honor.
- Thank you.

310
00:21:13,847 --> 00:21:15,838
You may enter Mr. Shaver as a juror.
Next!

311
00:21:16,007 --> 00:21:18,157
Prison for those people
who break the law.

312
00:21:18,327 --> 00:21:19,999
Your Honor,
we accept this juror.

313
00:21:20,167 --> 00:21:21,759
<i>- She looks good.</i>
- No objections.

314
00:21:21,927 --> 00:21:24,566
- Enter Miss Hullic.
- They flooding the community...

315
00:21:24,727 --> 00:21:26,080
<i>- No objection.</i>
- No. No. No.

316
00:21:26,247 --> 00:21:28,477
- Peremptory challenge.
- What are your grounds?

317
00:21:28,647 --> 00:21:29,921
- We accept.
- Mr. Rohr?

318
00:21:30,087 --> 00:21:31,406
- No objections.
- We accept.

319
00:21:31,567 --> 00:21:33,478
- You have a gun?
- I'm thinking about it.

320
00:21:33,647 --> 00:21:35,160
- You may go.
- Mossburg pump.

321
00:21:35,327 --> 00:21:38,205
I like him! Yes! Let's take him.

322
00:21:38,367 --> 00:21:40,085
- We accept this juror.
- No objection.

323
00:21:40,287 --> 00:21:42,323
- Herrera as a juror.
- I'm a mechanic.

324
00:21:42,487 --> 00:21:45,445
- What about gun control?
- Same way I feel about birth control.

325
00:21:45,607 --> 00:21:46,835
- Doesn't work.
- We accept.

326
00:21:47,007 --> 00:21:49,521
<i>- Enter Eddie Weese as a juror.</i>
- Yes, definitely.

327
00:21:49,687 --> 00:21:51,439
- No challenge.
- We accept this juror.

328
00:21:51,607 --> 00:21:53,962
- Call me Millie. I'm a sculptress.
- Accepted.

329
00:21:54,167 --> 00:21:55,759
- Take her.
- DeShazo as a juror.

330
00:21:55,927 --> 00:21:58,566
- We accept Ms. Deets as a juror.
- We accept this juror.

331
00:21:58,807 --> 00:22:01,037
- An AK-47 overstates the case.
- I want her.

332
00:22:01,327 --> 00:22:02,806
- I want her.
- No objection.

333
00:22:03,007 --> 00:22:05,316
- Lembeck as a juror. Mr. Cable.
- No challenge.

334
00:22:05,487 --> 00:22:07,239
- Challenge.
- Peremptory challenge.

335
00:22:07,567 --> 00:22:09,717
9 mm, more of a man's kind of gun.

336
00:22:09,887 --> 00:22:12,162
- Jerry Fernandez as a juror.
- I like him a lot.

337
00:22:12,327 --> 00:22:14,283
- We know about her.
- I don't carry a gun.

338
00:22:14,447 --> 00:22:16,403
- We accept.
- Let's not go down this road.

339
00:22:16,567 --> 00:22:17,795
Thank you, Mr. Rohr.

340
00:22:18,207 --> 00:22:19,879
Well, thank you all for being here.

341
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:21,685
Thank you, Jim.

342
00:22:22,087 --> 00:22:24,442
- Mr. Docken.
- Yes, sir.

343
00:22:24,607 --> 00:22:26,723
- How do you do?
- Fine, thank you.

344
00:22:27,007 --> 00:22:29,760
<i>How do you feel about</i>
<i>being a juror in this trial?</i>

345
00:22:30,207 --> 00:22:33,404
<i>- Do you feel you could be fair...</i>
- Look at how he's hunched <i>over...</i>

346
00:22:33,567 --> 00:22:36,877
...and his fingers are interlaced.
He's trying not to be too obvious.

347
00:22:37,047 --> 00:22:39,481
He's definitely on our side
of the fence.

348
00:22:39,647 --> 00:22:42,684
It's a veneer. He's campaigning.
He wants on. Bounce him.

349
00:22:42,847 --> 00:22:46,362
- We're almost out of challenges.
- I don't care. Bounce him!

350
00:22:47,967 --> 00:22:50,606
- Peremptory challenge.
- Hold on, hear me out.

351
00:22:50,767 --> 00:22:52,200
<i>Thank you, you're excused.</i>

352
00:22:52,367 --> 00:22:54,358
- I wanna be heard.
- You may be excused.

353
00:22:54,527 --> 00:22:56,324
I wanna be heard!

354
00:22:57,007 --> 00:22:58,565
<i>I wanna be heard!</i>

355
00:22:58,727 --> 00:23:02,402
This is the blood of innocent children
gunned down by greedy corporations.

356
00:23:04,127 --> 00:23:06,083
<i>You son of a bitch!</i>

357
00:23:06,247 --> 00:23:07,475
Help him.

358
00:23:07,967 --> 00:23:10,800
Help this man. Help this man.
Get him out of here.

359
00:23:12,407 --> 00:23:14,398
This is not a show in here.
Get him out.

360
00:23:14,567 --> 00:23:17,684
The nation's trying to kill itself.
You wanna give it the weapons.

361
00:23:18,487 --> 00:23:22,036
Son of a bitch! Let me go!
Let me go!

362
00:23:22,207 --> 00:23:24,801
Let me go! Bastards!

363
00:23:32,247 --> 00:23:34,078
Guess that's lunch.

364
00:23:35,527 --> 00:23:39,406
Somebody add "class clown" to
Mr. Easter's ever-expanding résumé.

365
00:23:39,807 --> 00:23:42,719
Court's adjourned. V oir dire will
resume tomorrow, 9 a.m.

366
00:23:42,887 --> 00:23:45,037
Attorneys, both of you,
in my chambers, now.

367
00:23:45,207 --> 00:23:46,686
<i>Good call.</i>

368
00:23:54,687 --> 00:23:57,679
<i>There are some things, however,</i>
<i>that seem to live eternal.</i>

369
00:23:57,847 --> 00:24:00,919
That's a tendency to always
come back asking for more.

370
00:24:01,087 --> 00:24:03,806
A total of 12 million more.

371
00:24:03,967 --> 00:24:08,085
Now, each of our gun companies has
already ponied up $4 million...

372
00:24:08,247 --> 00:24:11,159
<i>...into</i> this Sportsman's Legacy Fund.

373
00:24:11,327 --> 00:24:15,400
Now that may not seem like a hell of
a lot of money where you come from...

374
00:24:15,567 --> 00:24:19,640
...but we think $20 million ought
to be enough to secure a jury...

375
00:24:19,807 --> 00:24:22,844
<i>...in</i> the People's Republic of Berkeley,
let alone here.

376
00:24:25,727 --> 00:24:27,319
How about 30,000?

377
00:24:27,847 --> 00:24:30,441
Thirty thousand, what are
you talking about?

378
00:24:30,687 --> 00:24:32,962
It's an interesting amount to reflect on.

379
00:24:33,487 --> 00:24:36,445
The number of gun deaths every year.

380
00:24:36,927 --> 00:24:39,282
The number of men, women
and children disabled...

381
00:24:39,447 --> 00:24:42,803
<i>...by</i> your gentlemen's products,
last year alone:

382
00:24:42,967 --> 00:24:44,639
"One hundred thousand."

383
00:24:45,127 --> 00:24:48,437
Or we could focus...

384
00:24:49,287 --> 00:24:50,845
...on the number one.

385
00:24:52,607 --> 00:24:55,679
Because one is all they want.

386
00:24:55,847 --> 00:24:57,963
One win. One precedent.

387
00:24:58,127 --> 00:24:59,401
Once they get that...

388
00:24:59,567 --> 00:25:02,764
...they're gonna be traveling around
filing civil actions...

389
00:25:02,927 --> 00:25:06,397
...and siphoning away
at that $2 billion...

390
00:25:06,567 --> 00:25:11,004
...that you gentlemen sell in firearms
and ammo every fiscal year.

391
00:25:11,167 --> 00:25:13,476
Two billion dollars!

392
00:25:14,487 --> 00:25:16,842
Where I come from,
that's a lot of money.

393
00:25:17,407 --> 00:25:19,682
What I'm asking for is a <i>pittance...</i>

394
00:25:19,847 --> 00:25:22,315
...compared to what
a negative verdict will cost.

395
00:25:22,487 --> 00:25:26,765
Our share price is down 25 percent
just on word of this trial.

396
00:25:26,927 --> 00:25:32,320
- I'm down almost 30.
- I'll kick in an extra 1.5, but <i>no mas.</i>

397
00:25:34,367 --> 00:25:37,643
One-point-five each, that's 7.5 total.

398
00:25:38,287 --> 00:25:40,596
- I'll take it.
- You have any additional plans...

399
00:25:40,767 --> 00:25:42,485
...for this pittance?
- I do.

400
00:25:42,647 --> 00:25:45,036
- Lonnie Shaver. Manager here?
- All day.

401
00:25:45,207 --> 00:25:46,879
- Ernie Strode.
- I'm gonna put <i>you...</i>

402
00:25:47,047 --> 00:25:49,607
...in the grocery business.
- Grocery business?

403
00:25:49,767 --> 00:25:51,405
We're acquiring your store.

404
00:25:51,567 --> 00:25:54,684
Meeting the managers to discuss
their future in the organization.

405
00:25:54,847 --> 00:25:58,362
<i>- He hasn 't been promoted in five years.</i>
- Not all will be transitioned.

406
00:25:58,527 --> 00:26:01,325
We've ID'd you as a candidate
for the Super House program.

407
00:26:01,487 --> 00:26:04,081
- How soon can we fly you up?
- Mr. Shaver...

408
00:26:04,247 --> 00:26:07,080
...in subtle and unspoken ways
can be made to appreciate...

409
00:26:07,247 --> 00:26:09,920
...the terms of advancement
in the Hammond Foods empire.

410
00:26:10,087 --> 00:26:13,557
- I don't like the looks of this one.
- Ex-Marine drill instructor.

411
00:26:13,727 --> 00:26:16,799
These people are looking for a leader.
They'll follow Herrera.

412
00:26:16,967 --> 00:26:19,640
- Lf they elect someone else?
- Whoever they vote for...

413
00:26:19,807 --> 00:26:22,560
...will be following me.
Just like in Cincinnati...

414
00:26:22,727 --> 00:26:24,285
...and Oakland and Pittsburgh.

415
00:26:24,567 --> 00:26:30,039
Gentlemen, trials are too important
to be left up to juries.

416
00:26:33,767 --> 00:26:36,565
God save this state
and this honorable court.

417
00:26:36,727 --> 00:26:38,957
Good morning.
You may take your seats.

418
00:26:39,127 --> 00:26:41,357
- Who's next?
- Herman Grimes.

419
00:26:42,527 --> 00:26:45,439
<i>- Is Herman Grimes in the court?</i>
<i>- Mr. Grimes isn 't on my list.</i>

420
00:26:50,007 --> 00:26:52,237
There's a swinging door ahead
of you, honey.

421
00:26:52,407 --> 00:26:53,886
You got it?

422
00:26:54,647 --> 00:26:57,957
Forty-five degrees to your left,
then 20 degrees to your right.

423
00:26:58,127 --> 00:27:00,277
Hold on a minute there, Mr. Grimes.

424
00:27:00,447 --> 00:27:02,199
There's no need
for you to have come.

425
00:27:02,367 --> 00:27:04,085
You're excused for disability.

426
00:27:04,247 --> 00:27:06,238
What if I do not wish to be excused, sir?

427
00:27:06,407 --> 00:27:09,763
Well, I've never known a blind man
to serve on a jury.

428
00:27:09,927 --> 00:27:13,806
And I must say, I can't recall any case
or law or statute that would permit...

429
00:27:13,967 --> 00:27:16,083
...or prevent...
- <i>State v. Jack.</i>

430
00:27:16,247 --> 00:27:20,718
The Supreme Court has held that it is a
violation of constitutional due process...

431
00:27:20,887 --> 00:27:22,639
...to just automatically dismiss...

432
00:27:22,807 --> 00:27:24,684
...the blind from jury service.
- He's right.

433
00:27:24,847 --> 00:27:28,123
- Mr. Grimes, that's very impressive.
- Why are you smiling, sir?

434
00:27:30,847 --> 00:27:34,078
Mr. Rohr, Mr. Cable,
any objections to Mr. Grimes serving?

435
00:27:34,407 --> 00:27:37,479
The plaintiffs would welcome Mr. Grimes
to our jury, Your Honor.

436
00:27:38,367 --> 00:27:40,039
- Our jury.
- <i>Mr. Cable?</i>

437
00:27:40,207 --> 00:27:42,721
<i>- As would we on the defense.</i>
<i>- Who 's next?</i>

438
00:27:43,047 --> 00:27:45,880
- Nicholas Easter.
- Mr. Easter.

439
00:27:47,687 --> 00:27:49,484
- Mr. Rohr.
- Your Honor.

440
00:27:50,687 --> 00:27:52,598
<i>- Good morning, Mr. Easter.</i>
<i>- Good morning.</i>

441
00:27:52,767 --> 00:27:55,327
<i>Says here you work</i>
<i>in an electronics store.</i>

442
00:27:55,487 --> 00:27:56,966
<i>Yes, sir, that's correct.</i>

443
00:27:57,167 --> 00:28:00,637
How would you feel if a gun was
behind the counter in case of a robbery?

444
00:28:00,807 --> 00:28:03,480
- We're in the mall, sir.
- But I think you'd <i>agree...</i>

445
00:28:03,647 --> 00:28:06,036
...robberies take place in malls.
Do they not?

446
00:28:06,207 --> 00:28:09,882
We're in the Esplanade Mall, which
is across from the sheriff's office.

447
00:28:10,047 --> 00:28:11,958
Yes, I'm familiar where it is.

448
00:28:12,127 --> 00:28:16,279
You'd have to be on crack to rob us.
I guess that's my point.

449
00:28:16,447 --> 00:28:18,278
I see. Well, tell me...

450
00:28:18,447 --> 00:28:21,723
That's the second time you've looked
at your watch. We keeping you?

451
00:28:21,887 --> 00:28:24,526
No, Your Honor, I wouldn't
presume to waste your time.

452
00:28:24,687 --> 00:28:27,121
If you knew my situation,
you might excuse me...

453
00:28:27,287 --> 00:28:29,084
Your situation, Mr. Easter?

454
00:28:29,367 --> 00:28:30,800
Yes, Your Honor.

455
00:28:32,447 --> 00:28:35,041
- It's the Madden challenge.
- The Madden what?

456
00:28:35,327 --> 00:28:37,841
You know <i>Madden Football?</i>
It's a video game.

457
00:28:38,007 --> 00:28:40,123
You'd be surprised at how
many people play.

458
00:28:40,287 --> 00:28:44,041
Every year they choose the best 15
players from across the country...

459
00:28:44,207 --> 00:28:47,279
...to compete in a tournament against
NFL players and celebrities...

460
00:28:47,447 --> 00:28:49,483
- I'm not following you.
- It's like this.

461
00:28:49,647 --> 00:28:52,081
The prize is $ 100,000.

462
00:28:52,247 --> 00:28:55,239
I can't afford to pass up the opportunity
to make that cash...

463
00:28:55,407 --> 00:28:59,878
- I'd like you to learn civic responsibility.
- It's something I've been doing a long...

464
00:29:00,047 --> 00:29:03,403
The jury system originated because for
thousands of years before that...

465
00:29:03,567 --> 00:29:05,603
<i>... a judge had the power to hang...</i>

466
00:29:05,767 --> 00:29:09,521
...for example, any young man
he simply did not like.

467
00:29:10,447 --> 00:29:11,675
Yes, Your Honor.

468
00:29:11,847 --> 00:29:15,362
- Any objections, Mr. Rohr?
- I have no objection, whatsoever.

469
00:29:15,527 --> 00:29:16,801
- Mr. Cable?
- What do I do?

470
00:29:16,967 --> 00:29:18,195
<i>Any time, counselor.</i>

471
00:29:18,367 --> 00:29:21,484
Harkin sandbagged us.
Go ahead and take him. Take him.

472
00:29:22,687 --> 00:29:25,520
- No objections, Your Honor.
- Enter Mr. Easter as a juror.

473
00:29:25,687 --> 00:29:27,962
Freeze that, right there. Freeze it.

474
00:29:48,127 --> 00:29:50,960
<i>Thirty years in the trenches</i>
<i>have taught me this.</i>

475
00:29:51,207 --> 00:29:55,120
There's always a loose end.
Everybody has a secret...

476
00:29:55,287 --> 00:29:57,721
<i>...they</i> don't want you to find.
Find it.

477
00:29:58,567 --> 00:30:01,877
First group, Monroe: Rikki Coleman,
Sylvia DeShazo, Vanessa Lembeck.

478
00:30:02,047 --> 00:30:07,167
Mr. Klein: Herman Grimes,
Millie Dupree, Eddie Weese.

479
00:30:07,327 --> 00:30:11,161
Mr. Garson: Loreen Duke, Lonnie Shaver,
Frank Herrera.

480
00:30:11,447 --> 00:30:13,085
Mr. Lamb, the three alternates:

481
00:30:13,247 --> 00:30:17,604
Lydia Deets, yoga teacher. Phillip
Savelle, shrimp fisherman. Henry Wu.

482
00:30:17,767 --> 00:30:19,644
Find out everything we don't know.

483
00:30:19,807 --> 00:30:21,843
Doyle, you know this city
better than anyone.

484
00:30:22,007 --> 00:30:24,919
You take Jerry Fernandez, Stella Hullic,
Nicholas Easter.

485
00:30:25,087 --> 00:30:26,964
These are your babies, people.

486
00:30:27,127 --> 00:30:29,436
This is what you live for.

487
00:31:03,727 --> 00:31:05,524
Think you got the wrong apartment.

488
00:31:09,127 --> 00:31:11,766
What are you gonna do, call the cops?

489
00:31:20,087 --> 00:31:23,477
- You weren't there today.
- I couldn't, I was too nervous.

490
00:31:24,087 --> 00:31:26,123
What are you gonna do,
hit me in the head...

491
00:31:26,287 --> 00:31:28,517
...with my George Foster big stick?

492
00:31:29,087 --> 00:31:30,645
What are you nervous about, huh?

493
00:31:31,367 --> 00:31:34,996
You are not juror number nine
in the biggest case of the year.

494
00:31:35,167 --> 00:31:38,125
You're kidding. You're kidding me.
You're kidding me.

495
00:31:38,287 --> 00:31:40,676
No, I'm not kidding you.

496
00:31:40,927 --> 00:31:42,758
How'd you do it?

497
00:31:43,847 --> 00:31:46,315
- How'd you do it?
- The Madden Challenge.

498
00:31:47,007 --> 00:31:50,966
It was a thing of beauty.
The judge even threatened to hang me.

499
00:31:52,327 --> 00:31:54,682
- Juror number nine.
- Juror number nine.

500
00:31:56,487 --> 00:31:58,557
What do you have for me?

501
00:32:03,687 --> 00:32:06,155
I love St. Catherine.

502
00:32:47,647 --> 00:32:51,003
- How do I look?
- Handsome.

503
00:32:52,127 --> 00:32:55,802
- Do I look honest and trustworthy?
- To an innocent eye.

504
00:32:55,967 --> 00:32:59,846
- Enough to survive 10 to 15 in the pen?
- Don't say that. It's bad luck.

505
00:33:00,007 --> 00:33:01,440
Luck.

506
00:33:02,007 --> 00:33:04,919
Won't see each other for a while.
They'll be watching us.

507
00:33:05,087 --> 00:33:10,036
- You have to come back to bed, now.
- We're gonna have to be more careful.

508
00:33:14,847 --> 00:33:16,678
How much do you think it's worth?

509
00:33:16,847 --> 00:33:19,315
Ten, fifteen million, maybe more.

510
00:33:19,487 --> 00:33:23,480
- Look, that's enough. Come back to bed.
- We only need eight for a verdict.

511
00:33:23,647 --> 00:33:26,719
Everybody's got a button.
We just gotta find out where and push.

512
00:33:26,887 --> 00:33:28,718
You have them.

513
00:33:29,127 --> 00:33:31,595
We don't have anything yet.

514
00:33:57,447 --> 00:33:58,721
<i>- Celeste Wood.</i>

515
00:33:58,887 --> 00:34:02,004
You'll recall, two years ago,
Wood's stockbroker husband, <i>Jacob...</i>

516
00:34:02,167 --> 00:34:05,557
...was gunned down in a mass slaying
inside the firm where he worked.

517
00:34:05,727 --> 00:34:10,596
- Two years ago by a failed day trader,
who later turned the gun on himself.

518
00:34:10,767 --> 00:34:15,761
Never before has a jury found
the gun industry liable for murder.

519
00:34:15,927 --> 00:34:17,838
You might remember,
the former mayor...

520
00:34:18,007 --> 00:34:20,601
- after her husband was gunned down.

521
00:34:20,767 --> 00:34:23,406
The man leading this,
famed attorney Wendall Rohr.

522
00:34:24,087 --> 00:34:27,523
- Do you feel this lawsuit is frivolous?
- Well, it's capricious.

523
00:34:27,687 --> 00:34:31,805
I find it's unfortunate that Mr. Rohr
chose to use Ms. Wood and the courts...

524
00:34:31,967 --> 00:34:35,721
...as vehicles for civic reform.
- How do you expect to win this?

525
00:34:35,887 --> 00:34:38,720
Reckless, profit-hungry gun companies
like Vicksburg...

526
00:34:38,887 --> 00:34:43,005
...have been getting away with murder
for too long. And we have...

527
00:34:49,447 --> 00:34:52,041
- Lonnie Shaver.
- Hi, I'm Sylvia DeShazo.

528
00:34:52,207 --> 00:34:55,722
The room is 30 feet long
by 18 feet wide.

529
00:34:58,007 --> 00:35:00,646
- I'm losing a lot of money on jury duty.
- Oh, really?

530
00:35:00,807 --> 00:35:02,365
- Sixteen dollars a day.
- What?

531
00:35:02,527 --> 00:35:03,880
- Sixteen.
- Sixteen?

532
00:35:04,047 --> 00:35:08,165
- Yeah.
- No way. $ 16 a day? What's this, 1892?

533
00:35:08,327 --> 00:35:11,285
You're not supposed to do it for the pay,
but for civic duty.

534
00:35:11,447 --> 00:35:14,962
- Nice to meet you. Frank Herrera.
- Henry Wu. I became a citizen last year.

535
00:35:15,127 --> 00:35:18,437
He deserves it,
he's the president of the free world.

536
00:35:18,607 --> 00:35:22,156
Coffee and doughnuts over there.
Now, these muffins I made myself.

537
00:35:22,327 --> 00:35:24,397
A treat for the first day.

538
00:35:25,767 --> 00:35:27,883
These look like they are a treat.

539
00:35:32,407 --> 00:35:34,398
Okay. Morning.

540
00:35:35,447 --> 00:35:38,564
Well, everyone's here?
All accounted for?

541
00:35:38,727 --> 00:35:40,957
Good. I think we should elect
a jury foreman...

542
00:35:41,127 --> 00:35:44,358
...like Judge Harkin instructed us.
- Who would that be, Mr. Man?

543
00:35:44,927 --> 00:35:48,203
Well, if no one else feels strongly,
I'd throw my hat in the ring.

544
00:35:48,887 --> 00:35:50,718
Excuse me.

545
00:35:50,887 --> 00:35:52,684
- Mr...?
- Herrera. Frank Herrera.

546
00:35:53,367 --> 00:35:58,361
Mr. Herrera. Of all of us, what makes
you think you're the best person?

547
00:35:58,527 --> 00:36:01,678
- Well, Miss...?
- Mrs. Loreen Duke.

548
00:36:01,847 --> 00:36:05,078
Mrs. Duke. I was a master sergeant
in the Marine Corps.

549
00:36:05,247 --> 00:36:08,319
I served my country in Panama,
Grenada, Beirut, you name it.

550
00:36:08,487 --> 00:36:10,523
- I can run a six-minute mile.
- Young lady.

551
00:36:10,687 --> 00:36:13,281
If nobody minds,
I'd also like to be considered.

552
00:36:13,447 --> 00:36:17,725
I might not have served in Grenada,
but I'm the mother of two small children.

553
00:36:17,887 --> 00:36:21,118
In that case, y'all ought to consider me.
Hell, I got three kids.

554
00:36:21,287 --> 00:36:23,596
Ladies and gentlemen,
with all due respect...

555
00:36:23,767 --> 00:36:26,361
...I think I know who would make
an excellent foreman.

556
00:36:26,527 --> 00:36:29,963
- And who might that be, Mr...?
- Easter. Nicholas Easter, sir.

557
00:36:30,967 --> 00:36:34,004
I was watching people very closely
during the jury selection...

558
00:36:34,167 --> 00:36:37,125
...and only this man...
I don't know your name, sir.

559
00:36:37,287 --> 00:36:39,323
- Herman Grimes.
- Only Mr. Grimes...

560
00:36:39,487 --> 00:36:40,761
No, just Herman.

561
00:36:40,927 --> 00:36:44,681
Only Herman had the guts to stand up
to the judge and seems to know...

562
00:36:44,847 --> 00:36:47,486
...a little something about the law.
So in my book...

563
00:36:47,647 --> 00:36:51,276
- ...it'd be good for him to represent us.
- But...

564
00:36:51,447 --> 00:36:54,359
- But he's blind...
- So what? So is justice, right?

565
00:36:54,527 --> 00:36:57,166
- That's right, brother.
- What do you think? Up to it?

566
00:36:57,327 --> 00:36:58,760
Of course I am.

567
00:36:58,927 --> 00:37:00,804
All in favor of Herman?

568
00:37:09,647 --> 00:37:13,003
- Did I get any votes?
- Hey, it's unanimous. You're in.

569
00:37:14,207 --> 00:37:15,959
All right, listen up.

570
00:37:16,127 --> 00:37:18,482
Court's in session.
Lunch is set for 1:00.

571
00:37:18,647 --> 00:37:21,639
We order up from v erti's Marte.
Please, fill out a menu.

572
00:37:21,807 --> 00:37:24,401
- Thank you.
- Make sure you circle what you want.

573
00:37:24,567 --> 00:37:27,161
Don't make it too expensive.
Thank you.

574
00:37:27,327 --> 00:37:30,239
I had this last week.
It's really good. Thank you.

575
00:37:30,407 --> 00:37:32,841
- They don't have sandwiches.
- Nothing on that menu.

576
00:37:33,007 --> 00:37:34,281
All right, all right.

577
00:37:39,047 --> 00:37:43,802
October, two years ago,
at 8:45 a.m. On a Monday morning...

578
00:37:43,967 --> 00:37:47,482
...a man named Kevin Peltier casually
walks into the brokerage house...

579
00:37:47,647 --> 00:37:50,320
...from which he was fired
the previous Friday morning.

580
00:37:50,487 --> 00:37:53,559
He walks into the elevator,
he loads a 36-round magazine...

581
00:37:53,727 --> 00:37:58,084
...into his Performa 990 semiautomatic,
and when he reaches the third floor...

582
00:37:58,247 --> 00:38:02,559
...opens fire on his former coworkers,
killing 11 and critically wounding five...

583
00:38:02,727 --> 00:38:05,605
...before turning the gun on himself.

584
00:38:05,887 --> 00:38:08,606
They never had a chance.
This was less than two minutes.

585
00:38:08,767 --> 00:38:12,043
They couldn't stop him.
Eleven lives ended.

586
00:38:12,807 --> 00:38:14,843
That's all you jurors minus one.

587
00:38:15,007 --> 00:38:19,080
And among them was Jacob Wood, the
husband of my client, Celeste Wood...

588
00:38:19,247 --> 00:38:22,683
...and the father of their son Henry,
6 years old.

589
00:38:23,807 --> 00:38:28,278
I don't know about you, but I'm angry
at the tragic and senseless loss of life.

590
00:38:28,447 --> 00:38:31,962
Why does the Vicksburg Firearms
Company make it so easy...

591
00:38:32,567 --> 00:38:34,842
...to buy these guns
on the underground market?

592
00:38:35,007 --> 00:38:38,522
Because they care more about making
money than they do about your life...

593
00:38:38,687 --> 00:38:42,839
...or my life or the life
of that woman's husband.

594
00:38:45,207 --> 00:38:48,438
A very courageous former executive
of Vicksburg Firearms...

595
00:38:48,607 --> 00:38:53,237
...is gonna testify
that this Performa 990 semiautomatic...

596
00:38:53,407 --> 00:38:56,683
...was manufactured for,
principally, criminals...

597
00:38:57,287 --> 00:39:00,165
...and all those others poised
for violence.

598
00:39:01,167 --> 00:39:02,600
- One...
- Excuse me.

599
00:39:02,767 --> 00:39:05,076
Would you give these to Mr. Rohr
and Mr. Cable?

600
00:39:05,247 --> 00:39:08,080
- Into a very efficient mass murderer.

601
00:39:13,567 --> 00:39:17,082
<i>Yes, it was Mr. Peltier that squeezed</i>
<i>the trigger that awful morning.</i>

602
00:39:17,247 --> 00:39:19,477
But it was the Vicksburg
Firearms Company...

603
00:39:19,647 --> 00:39:22,445
...through a deliberate,
negligent distribution policy...

604
00:39:22,607 --> 00:39:27,158
...that put that assault-type weapon
into the hands of Mr. Peltier.

605
00:39:27,327 --> 00:39:30,683
As such, they were complicit
in those murders.

606
00:39:31,327 --> 00:39:35,036
This I'll prove to you during the course
of the trial. Thank you very much.

607
00:39:35,207 --> 00:39:36,560
Your Honor.

608
00:39:40,447 --> 00:39:41,721
Mr. Cable.

609
00:39:43,767 --> 00:39:45,359
Thank you, Your Honor.

610
00:39:45,527 --> 00:39:47,677
- I think that went very well.
- We'll be fine.

611
00:39:48,287 --> 00:39:50,755
That was quite provocative.

612
00:39:51,367 --> 00:39:54,120
I wanna tell you two things
about guns today.

613
00:39:54,287 --> 00:39:55,879
I don't think either will be news.

614
00:39:57,487 --> 00:39:58,886
First: Guns are dangerous.

615
00:39:59,047 --> 00:40:01,515
They're guns.
This is their function.

616
00:40:01,687 --> 00:40:03,996
I wanna tell you, no one
is more aware of that...

617
00:40:04,167 --> 00:40:06,317
...or takes more responsibility for it...

618
00:40:10,847 --> 00:40:12,200
- since before the Civil War.

619
00:40:12,367 --> 00:40:17,077
The automobile industry works every day
to ensure their cars are safe.

620
00:40:17,887 --> 00:40:19,605
Why? Because they drive them.

621
00:40:19,767 --> 00:40:21,917
The people at Vicksburg
work every day...

622
00:40:22,087 --> 00:40:24,726
...to keep the guns
out of the hands of criminals.

623
00:40:24,887 --> 00:40:27,196
Why? Because they have families
with children...

624
00:40:27,367 --> 00:40:31,440
- Did you see who handed this to you?
- It was a woman. She had blond hair.

625
00:40:31,607 --> 00:40:34,440
She had pretty blond hair,
like that woman on television.

626
00:40:35,247 --> 00:40:37,636
We didn't catch her
on any of the CCTVs.

627
00:40:37,807 --> 00:40:41,243
Doesn't matter. I'm sure she was
wigged. I doubt you'll find <i>any...</i>

628
00:40:41,407 --> 00:40:43,762
...but spray this for prints.
Anything turns up...

629
00:40:43,927 --> 00:40:46,316
I'll process it through the database.

630
00:40:46,487 --> 00:40:48,682
<i>We are not here to legislate.</i>

631
00:40:48,847 --> 00:40:50,758
Mr. Cable is winding up.

632
00:40:51,367 --> 00:40:53,722
<i>Ladies and gentlemen of the jury...</i>

633
00:40:53,887 --> 00:40:57,846
...amidst the finger-pointing,
Mr. Rohr did say one true thing.

634
00:40:58,527 --> 00:41:01,200
This case is about money.

635
00:41:01,367 --> 00:41:03,676
Hi, I'm calling from the courthouse.

636
00:41:03,847 --> 00:41:08,284
It looks like Judge Harkin
won't be breaking till after 2.

637
00:41:08,607 --> 00:41:11,565
Would you mind holding his jury's
lunch order till then?

638
00:41:11,727 --> 00:41:13,160
Thank you.

639
00:41:21,167 --> 00:41:23,283
I'm also a vegetarian.

640
00:41:23,447 --> 00:41:28,123
What do you think about her?
I hear she teaches a class at Tulane.

641
00:41:28,287 --> 00:41:30,278
- Yeah?
- Wouldn't mind taking that class.

642
00:41:30,447 --> 00:41:33,086
- What subject?
- Well, she's a tall glass of iced tea.

643
00:41:33,247 --> 00:41:36,045
A little too much lemon,
a little too much ice.

644
00:41:38,487 --> 00:41:42,719
I'm sorry, but would you mind not doing
that in here? I'm predisposed to asthma.

645
00:41:42,887 --> 00:41:45,276
I'll open a window.
It ain't gonna bother you.

646
00:41:45,447 --> 00:41:48,405
Actually, I mind too.
Sorry, secondhand smoke.

647
00:41:48,567 --> 00:41:51,035
I don't wanna smoke
your cigarettes either.

648
00:41:51,207 --> 00:41:54,643
I can't smoke. I can't leave the room.
What is this, California?

649
00:41:54,807 --> 00:41:57,799
- It is against the rules.
- Be quiet. You just an alternate.

650
00:41:57,967 --> 00:41:59,958
What does that have to do
with anything?

651
00:42:02,167 --> 00:42:05,557
Come on, come on. We're gonna
be here for a while together.

652
00:42:05,727 --> 00:42:08,366
- So why are you bothering me?
- Let him smoke.

653
00:42:11,407 --> 00:42:14,046
I think we're all just hungry.
And where's our <i>lunch...</i>

654
00:42:14,207 --> 00:42:15,799
...they promised us?
It's 1:30.

655
00:42:15,967 --> 00:42:19,482
That's why I wanna smoke, I'm starving.
Tamp down my appetite.

656
00:42:19,647 --> 00:42:23,117
- Want me to see what's going on?
- Good idea, Nick.

657
00:42:32,327 --> 00:42:35,876
- Iook over there and sees a cow.
He sees a golf ball in the cow's ass.

658
00:42:36,047 --> 00:42:39,722
And he says, "Excuse me, ma'am,"
he raises that cow's tail and says:

659
00:42:39,887 --> 00:42:43,197
"Does this look like yours?"
And she hit him with a four iron!

660
00:42:43,367 --> 00:42:47,076
Excuse me, judge.
There's someone to see you.

661
00:42:47,247 --> 00:42:48,600
All right.

662
00:42:48,767 --> 00:42:50,041
Excuse me, gentlemen.

663
00:42:54,487 --> 00:42:56,603
- You are...?
- Nick Easter, juror nine.

664
00:42:56,767 --> 00:43:00,157
Yes. What are you doing
outside of the jury room, Mr. Easter?

665
00:43:00,327 --> 00:43:01,601
And where is Lou Dell?

666
00:43:01,767 --> 00:43:04,281
- She's chatting in the hallway, sir.
- Mr. Easter...

667
00:43:04,447 --> 00:43:07,041
<i>...I'd</i> advise you to return
and finish your lunch.

668
00:43:07,207 --> 00:43:10,597
That's the problem, sir. I think
somebody forgot to order our lunch.

669
00:43:10,767 --> 00:43:12,962
- The jury has no lunch?
- That's why I'm here.

670
00:43:13,127 --> 00:43:16,597
Everybody knows you like to keep
a tight schedule on your bench.

671
00:43:16,767 --> 00:43:20,476
If we're gonna be back in less than 45
minutes, to be honest, we're hungry.

672
00:43:20,647 --> 00:43:23,480
Well, what exactly
would you like me to do?

673
00:43:23,647 --> 00:43:26,480
Lonnie, can you pass me
some garlic bread? Got any there?

674
00:43:26,647 --> 00:43:29,559
Oh, absolutely, man.
This stuff is delicious.

675
00:43:37,767 --> 00:43:41,680
I'm not sure, but I believe
I'm buying lunch for the jury.

676
00:43:54,247 --> 00:43:56,158
Look, jury's right there.

677
00:44:03,007 --> 00:44:05,805
In 35 years, that is the most
absurd thing I've ever seen.

678
00:44:05,967 --> 00:44:08,435
- You have mustard on your tie.
- I did it on purpose.

679
00:44:09,087 --> 00:44:13,683
First day of the trial, the judge is having
lunch with the jury. What's that about?

680
00:44:13,847 --> 00:44:15,758
- Look at that.
- What?

681
00:44:28,127 --> 00:44:29,242
Let's go.

682
00:44:29,727 --> 00:44:31,558
Hey, hey, hey! To Nick!

683
00:44:31,727 --> 00:44:33,080
- To Nick!
- Nick!

684
00:44:33,247 --> 00:44:35,477
- This is horseshit.
- It wasn't me!

685
00:44:35,647 --> 00:44:38,207
It was Judge Harkin.

686
00:44:38,367 --> 00:44:40,119
Judge Harkin!

687
00:44:41,127 --> 00:44:44,005
Okay. That's enough.
Thank you very much. All right.

688
00:44:48,887 --> 00:44:51,401
- Here's the deposition you needed.
- Thank you.

689
00:45:01,607 --> 00:45:03,598
Are we gonna talk about this?

690
00:45:03,807 --> 00:45:06,367
I can't believe you had the nerve
to bring that here.

691
00:45:06,527 --> 00:45:10,645
- I think we ought to discuss it.
- Why don't you just give it to the judge?

692
00:45:10,807 --> 00:45:13,401
- They'd throw the case out.
- Let me explain something.

693
00:45:13,567 --> 00:45:16,127
That's a defense tactic, okay?
All it's meant to <i>do...</i>

694
00:45:16,287 --> 00:45:19,563
...is throw our focus off
so that we can move toward a mistrial.

695
00:45:19,727 --> 00:45:21,922
I'd like it out of the office.
Give it to me.

696
00:45:23,007 --> 00:45:26,602
Barry, after you shred it,
burn it, okay?

697
00:45:27,207 --> 00:45:30,040
- You know how many of those I get?
- What if it's for real?

698
00:45:30,647 --> 00:45:33,115
- No, it's not for real.
- What if it is?

699
00:45:33,287 --> 00:45:36,882
Well, if it's for real,
then this isn't a trial, is it?

700
00:45:37,047 --> 00:45:40,119
Then this is an auction,
and I might as well get on the phone...

701
00:45:40,287 --> 00:45:43,723
...and call up all those anti-gun activist
friends and tell them:

702
00:45:43,887 --> 00:45:47,960
"We're just gonna put on a telethon,
and we will buy this verdict."

703
00:45:50,287 --> 00:45:53,245
Because they're not gonna think of that,
are they?

704
00:45:56,927 --> 00:45:59,395
Somebody wanna get that?
Got any other suggestions?

705
00:45:59,567 --> 00:46:04,004
Look at it. Syntax, handwriting, word
choice. Clearly, a woman did the note.

706
00:46:04,167 --> 00:46:07,125
- Someone's working the inside. A juror.
- Miss Monroe.

707
00:46:07,287 --> 00:46:10,199
I think seven hours spent on this
is sufficient. We agree?

708
00:46:10,367 --> 00:46:12,927
Mr. Fitch, I got a call for you,
line seven.

709
00:46:15,487 --> 00:46:18,206
- Yes?
<i>- Hello, Rankin.</i>

710
00:46:18,367 --> 00:46:22,326
<i>I'm the agent handling the property</i>
<i>you were notified about earlier today.</i>

711
00:46:22,487 --> 00:46:25,684
- I'd like to know who I'm speaking with.
- You can call me Marlee.

712
00:46:26,287 --> 00:46:28,118
Pay phone, 15 miles away.

713
00:46:28,287 --> 00:46:29,515
You can call me Marlee.

714
00:46:29,687 --> 00:46:33,077
- Where are we going with this, Marlee?
<i>- All the way to the verdict.</i>

715
00:46:33,247 --> 00:46:34,999
<i>The fact is, the jury's mine.</i>

716
00:46:35,167 --> 00:46:36,486
I can push it either way...

717
00:46:36,647 --> 00:46:38,603
...for a price.
- Sounds good.

718
00:46:38,767 --> 00:46:41,076
So good, in fact,
I don't believe you can do it.

719
00:46:41,247 --> 00:46:43,044
You're old enough to remember a <i>time...</i>

720
00:46:43,207 --> 00:46:46,324
...when people delivered what they
promised. I'm one of those people.

721
00:46:46,487 --> 00:46:49,604
I'm also old enough to remember
Watergate, Abscam, Linda Tripp...

722
00:46:49,767 --> 00:46:53,646
- and other times people got entrapped
for engaging in conversations like this.

723
00:46:53,807 --> 00:46:56,082
And you'd do very good
to remember that.

724
00:46:56,247 --> 00:46:59,159
- <i>There are consequences.</i>
- Well, let me worry about those.

725
00:46:59,327 --> 00:47:02,080
For now, I just hope
you're feeling patriotic.

726
00:47:02,527 --> 00:47:05,280
- You hope I'm feeling...?
- Patriotic?

727
00:47:06,847 --> 00:47:09,361
- Morning, Nick.
- Morning, Lou.

728
00:47:10,487 --> 00:47:12,603
- Good morning, Vanessa.
- Morning.

729
00:47:12,767 --> 00:47:14,041
- Nick.
- Hey, guys.

730
00:47:14,207 --> 00:47:17,722
- How you doing, man?
- Okay. Thank you.

731
00:47:18,367 --> 00:47:20,323
- Hey, Lonnie.
- Hey, man.

732
00:47:20,487 --> 00:47:22,364
Morning, Frank.

733
00:47:24,647 --> 00:47:26,922
Frank, you were in Panama
and Grenada, right?

734
00:47:27,807 --> 00:47:30,799
- And Beirut.
- That really must have been something.

735
00:47:31,727 --> 00:47:35,606
Yeah. Pulling the bodies of friends
out of rubble. It was really something.

736
00:47:35,767 --> 00:47:39,840
No, you don't understand. I had a friend
in Desert Storm, in the Corps too.

737
00:47:40,007 --> 00:47:42,840
- What division?
- The 1-4 out of Pendleton.

738
00:47:43,007 --> 00:47:46,044
Yeah, well, that was mostly air power.
Not much real action.

739
00:47:49,127 --> 00:47:51,163
Actually, there was, Frank.

740
00:47:52,647 --> 00:47:55,161
You don't know what the hell
you're talking about.

741
00:47:55,327 --> 00:47:59,798
My friend's name was Donny Rabbs, and
he was shot down in a Kuwaiti oil field.

742
00:47:59,967 --> 00:48:03,198
- He was killed 12 years ago today.
- Sorry to hear that.

743
00:48:03,367 --> 00:48:07,406
Sorry, it's a strange day. I figure if I
don't remember him today, nobody will.

744
00:48:07,567 --> 00:48:09,876
That's the way people are.
Short memories.

745
00:48:10,047 --> 00:48:13,084
That's terrible,
but we don't always know God's plan.

746
00:48:14,567 --> 00:48:17,718
Listen, I don't know
if it would be inappropriate...

747
00:48:17,887 --> 00:48:21,402
...but do you think we could
do something today to remember him?

748
00:48:21,567 --> 00:48:24,525
- We could say the Lord's Prayer.
- I can't ask people to pray.

749
00:48:24,687 --> 00:48:27,247
- "God Bless America"?
- I couldn't ask people to sing.

750
00:48:27,407 --> 00:48:30,126
- I don't sing.
- I don't sing, okay?

751
00:48:31,687 --> 00:48:33,439
You know what?
I have an idea.

752
00:48:33,607 --> 00:48:36,440
Good morning.
You may take your seats, please.

753
00:48:42,007 --> 00:48:45,716
I pledge allegiance to the flag...

754
00:48:45,887 --> 00:48:49,004
...of the United States of America...

755
00:48:49,607 --> 00:48:53,202
...and to the republic
for which it stands...

756
00:48:53,367 --> 00:48:56,484
...one nation under God...

757
00:48:56,647 --> 00:48:59,161
...indivisible, with liberty...

758
00:48:59,327 --> 00:49:01,761
...and justice for all.

759
00:49:02,487 --> 00:49:05,240
I don't know about you,
but I'm feeling pretty patriotic.

760
00:49:05,407 --> 00:49:07,637
Thank you, please take your seats.

761
00:49:07,807 --> 00:49:09,206
Jesus.

762
00:49:22,007 --> 00:49:23,599
Pull!

763
00:49:31,087 --> 00:49:32,964
You wanted to see me?

764
00:49:33,207 --> 00:49:36,119
Mr. Cable called me last night
in a bit of a panic.

765
00:49:36,927 --> 00:49:40,237
Now, he's concerned that someone's
trying to monkey with our jury.

766
00:49:41,087 --> 00:49:43,476
As am I.
As are my associates.

767
00:49:44,807 --> 00:49:47,560
- Who is it?
- It's a parlor game.

768
00:49:47,727 --> 00:49:50,685
Just because somebody can influence
where a jury has lunch...

769
00:49:50,847 --> 00:49:52,997
...doesn't mean they can hand us
the verdict.

770
00:49:53,167 --> 00:49:55,283
Well, this is where I get
a little confused.

771
00:49:55,447 --> 00:49:57,165
Because I was under the impression...

772
00:49:57,327 --> 00:49:59,557
...that we already purchased
ourselves a verdict.

773
00:50:04,207 --> 00:50:06,198
You know what I love best
about this gun?

774
00:50:07,047 --> 00:50:11,996
It's over 70 years old,
just as reliable as the day it was made.

775
00:50:14,087 --> 00:50:15,315
Mr. Fitch!

776
00:50:17,087 --> 00:50:19,840
You find out who it is, will you?

777
00:50:22,247 --> 00:50:23,566
Pull!

778
00:50:23,727 --> 00:50:26,287
<i>- One nation, under God...</i>

779
00:50:26,447 --> 00:50:29,200
At some point, everyone on the jury
acknowledges Herrera.

780
00:50:29,367 --> 00:50:32,040
- It's like they're doing it for him.
- It's not him.

781
00:50:32,207 --> 00:50:35,085
Right here at the end, Loreen Duke,
juror number 10...

782
00:50:35,247 --> 00:50:38,284
Right there! Freeze there.
But tighten in on her left hand.

783
00:50:40,487 --> 00:50:41,920
Right there.

784
00:50:44,007 --> 00:50:45,235
Isn't that sweet?

785
00:50:45,407 --> 00:50:48,604
Nicholas Easter, our song
and dance man, has an agenda.

786
00:50:49,207 --> 00:50:52,438
Mr. Lamb, how did this confidence man
crash my jury pool?

787
00:50:52,607 --> 00:50:56,566
- I don't know. I'd need some time, sir.
- Now. I'm asking for an educated guess.

788
00:50:57,407 --> 00:51:01,116
Maybe he just did it. I mean,
who wants jury duty? Nobody, right?

789
00:51:01,287 --> 00:51:03,357
It's like going to the dentist.
It's worse.

790
00:51:03,527 --> 00:51:06,439
It's a municipal database
nobody would want to hack into.

791
00:51:06,607 --> 00:51:09,167
Security is weak.
He could put his name on the list...

792
00:51:09,327 --> 00:51:10,965
I got it, Mr. Lamb, thank you.

793
00:51:11,127 --> 00:51:12,765
- Mr. Doyle.
- I'm on it.

794
00:51:12,927 --> 00:51:14,963
<i>Your Honor.</i>
<i>Good afternoon, Mr. Murphy.</i>

795
00:51:15,127 --> 00:51:16,958
You own and operate Excalibur Guns.

796
00:51:17,127 --> 00:51:20,278
- Yes, sir, I do.
- Isn't Excalibur Guns an outlet <i>store...</i>

797
00:51:20,447 --> 00:51:22,881
...for Vicksburg Firearms?
- Yes, sir.

798
00:51:23,047 --> 00:51:25,083
Would you tell us about
your arrangement...

799
00:51:25,247 --> 00:51:30,765
...with Michael Kincaid, who illegally sold
this Performa 990 semiautomatic...

800
00:51:30,927 --> 00:51:34,044
...to Kevin Peltier smack-dab
out of the trunk of his car.

801
00:51:34,207 --> 00:51:35,720
- My arrangement?
- Yes, sir.

802
00:51:36,487 --> 00:51:40,605
Well, Mikey... Mr. Kincaid
bought guns from my store.

803
00:51:40,767 --> 00:51:42,678
At a rate of more than 25 a month.

804
00:51:42,847 --> 00:51:46,840
Didn't you ever wonder who your friend
Mikey was selling these guns to?

805
00:51:47,007 --> 00:51:49,726
- That's none of my business.
- It's not your problem.

806
00:51:49,887 --> 00:51:53,004
- Hold on, I didn't say that.
- Objection. Counsel is testifying.

807
00:51:53,167 --> 00:51:55,237
Sustained. Mr. Rohr.

808
00:51:57,487 --> 00:51:59,125
Thanks a lot.

809
00:52:04,607 --> 00:52:06,882
- Afternoon.
- Afternoon.

810
00:52:11,447 --> 00:52:14,086
<i>- Your friend, Mikey Kincaid,</i>
<i>28 guns in December.</i>

811
00:52:14,247 --> 00:52:19,002
Ever wonder why one man would buy
112 guns in a period of four months?

812
00:52:19,647 --> 00:52:21,444
- Collector.
- A collector, sir?

813
00:52:21,607 --> 00:52:25,725
A hundred and twelve weapons, and all
of them semiautomatic assault weapons.

814
00:52:26,007 --> 00:52:27,918
- I don't know.
- Come on, take a guess.

815
00:52:28,687 --> 00:52:30,678
- Christmas presents?
- That's a guess.

816
00:52:30,847 --> 00:52:33,725
- Objection. This is all speculation.
- Sustained.

817
00:52:33,887 --> 00:52:35,320
Did they send a field rep...

818
00:52:35,487 --> 00:52:37,239
...out to investigate?
- No, sir.

819
00:52:37,407 --> 00:52:40,444
- Because they were pleased with you?
- Say again.

820
00:52:40,607 --> 00:52:43,121
Is it not true that Vicksburg Firearms...

821
00:52:43,287 --> 00:52:47,485
...instead of investigating the increasing
number of guns being sold to one man...

822
00:52:47,647 --> 00:52:51,242
...instead sent you and your wife
on a trip to Jamaica?

823
00:52:51,407 --> 00:52:53,477
- No.
- No?

824
00:52:54,007 --> 00:52:56,362
My wife hates Jamaica.
We switched to Cancun.

825
00:52:59,047 --> 00:53:01,845
- I have no further questions, Your Honor.
- Thank you.

826
00:53:02,007 --> 00:53:06,364
We'll adjourn. Hold cross till tomorrow.
Release the jury 45 minutes early.

827
00:53:46,447 --> 00:53:48,756
Oh, hi. Yeah, the landlord let me in.

828
00:53:48,927 --> 00:53:52,124
He said some tenants have been
having trouble with the cable.

829
00:53:52,807 --> 00:53:54,763
But I checked yours out, and...

830
00:54:06,127 --> 00:54:07,640
Hey!

831
00:55:49,247 --> 00:55:50,965
Hey!

832
00:56:05,607 --> 00:56:07,802
<i>Looks fine.</i>
<i>I don 't think you have anything...</i>

833
00:56:09,487 --> 00:56:12,399
- What have we got, people?
- The drive's been erased <i>twice...</i>

834
00:56:12,567 --> 00:56:15,764
...but not zeroed out. He may have been
sloppier than he thought.

835
00:56:15,967 --> 00:56:18,435
- Give me a few moments.
- Mr. Fitch.

836
00:56:18,607 --> 00:56:20,757
Lamb, trace it.

837
00:56:23,287 --> 00:56:25,084
Fitch here.

838
00:56:25,287 --> 00:56:27,118
You don't play nice.

839
00:56:27,287 --> 00:56:30,677
<i>- What are you talking about?</i>
- You broke into Nick Easter's apartment.

840
00:56:31,167 --> 00:56:32,805
You freely assume it was me?

841
00:56:32,967 --> 00:56:35,083
<i>Wouldn 't you be disappointed if I didn 't?</i>

842
00:56:35,247 --> 00:56:38,205
<i>I'm bumping a juror. One of yours.</i>

843
00:56:38,607 --> 00:56:40,643
This time's just gonna be a pinprick.

844
00:56:41,207 --> 00:56:43,960
<i>Next time, it's really gonna hurt.</i>

845
00:57:08,807 --> 00:57:10,923
- Hey.
- Hello.

846
00:57:19,487 --> 00:57:22,365
Looks like somebody had themselves
a good time last night.

847
00:57:23,927 --> 00:57:25,599
I woke up on my stove.

848
00:57:26,167 --> 00:57:28,203
Oh, man.

849
00:57:29,287 --> 00:57:31,801
Stella, you don't got any aspirin, do you?

850
00:57:47,087 --> 00:57:50,045
- I think I can do better than an aspirin.
- Yeah?

851
00:57:50,207 --> 00:57:52,084
Little hair of the dog.

852
00:57:52,367 --> 00:57:56,121
- Can you sweeten this up for me?
- Yeah, put it under the table.

853
00:57:56,287 --> 00:57:58,084
You're an angel.

854
00:57:59,287 --> 00:58:01,562
- Let me pour it. Let me do it!
- I'll pour it.

855
00:58:01,727 --> 00:58:03,160
Jesus.

856
00:58:09,007 --> 00:58:10,679
It's mine, sir.

857
00:58:10,847 --> 00:58:13,315
I didn't take you for a day drinker,
Mr. Easter.

858
00:58:13,487 --> 00:58:14,715
I'm usually not.

859
00:58:16,007 --> 00:58:18,805
You still trying to get off my jury,
is that it?

860
00:58:20,007 --> 00:58:22,885
Your Honor, I took an oath
to do my best, and I meant it.

861
00:58:23,047 --> 00:58:25,197
Difficult as that is to believe...

862
00:58:25,367 --> 00:58:28,200
<i>...it's</i> even more difficult
to believe this is your liquor.

863
00:58:28,367 --> 00:58:31,916
I might be wrong, but I don't think
that's your shade of lipstick.

864
00:58:34,047 --> 00:58:35,844
Miss Hullic?

865
00:58:36,007 --> 00:58:39,317
Moving into Miss Hullic's spot
will be first alternate Lydia Deets.

866
00:58:39,487 --> 00:58:42,718
Miss Deets, could you join
the jurors in the box, please?

867
00:58:43,447 --> 00:58:47,918
Welcome to our jury. I trust you got
the same instructions as the rest.

868
00:58:50,247 --> 00:58:52,807
Cell phone. Untraceable.

869
00:58:53,927 --> 00:58:56,839
- Marlee?
- I'd like your offer, Mr. Fitch.

870
00:58:57,007 --> 00:59:01,285
Not over the phone. This is not
gonna take place long-distance.

871
00:59:01,447 --> 00:59:04,564
<i>- Want to lose another juror?</i>
<i>- Anybody can get a juror booted.</i>

872
00:59:04,727 --> 00:59:06,922
That doesn't show
you can deliver a verdict.

873
00:59:07,087 --> 00:59:08,998
I could get Easter canned if I wanted.

874
00:59:09,167 --> 00:59:13,160
But you won't do that. You need him
to guarantee the jury swings your way.

875
00:59:13,367 --> 00:59:16,518
<i>So next time I call,</i>
<i>have your offer ready.</i>

876
00:59:21,287 --> 00:59:22,561
Ladies and gentlemen...

877
00:59:22,807 --> 00:59:27,642
...this girl is an amateur,
do you understand? A dilettante.

878
00:59:27,807 --> 00:59:30,765
And I want this nonsense ended today.

879
00:59:30,927 --> 00:59:33,521
I want you to find her.
I want you to contain her.

880
00:59:33,687 --> 00:59:35,723
Because you're losing me my jury!

881
00:59:38,487 --> 00:59:40,876
Now find something
on every one of them.

882
00:59:41,047 --> 00:59:44,801
Pull their files. Review every word,
every photo, every medical record.

883
00:59:44,967 --> 00:59:46,878
Do it!

884
00:59:50,087 --> 00:59:51,486
What do we have?!

885
00:59:51,647 --> 00:59:53,763
Rikki coleman's boyfriend
is Neil Pollard.

886
00:59:53,927 --> 00:59:57,442
Mrs. Coleman broke it off with him
two months after the abortion.

887
00:59:57,607 --> 01:00:00,644
Mr. Coleman has racked up
three cases of domestic battery.

888
01:00:00,807 --> 01:00:02,604
So she didn't cry to him about it.

889
01:00:03,487 --> 01:00:07,241
Your husband looks a lot different than
your boyfriend with you at the clinic.

890
01:00:07,407 --> 01:00:09,079
We'll be in touch.

891
01:00:13,167 --> 01:00:17,046
Four months ago, Mr. Weese began
filling prescriptions for the following:

892
01:00:17,207 --> 01:00:20,040
Crixivan, Epivir and AZT.

893
01:00:20,207 --> 01:00:23,517
<i>Unbeknownst to his mother,</i>
<i>his employer, his church and friends...</i>

894
01:00:23,687 --> 01:00:25,723
...Mr. Weese is HIV-positive.

895
01:00:25,887 --> 01:00:27,400
Get off me.

896
01:00:28,127 --> 01:00:29,958
That's what I'm talking about.

897
01:00:31,887 --> 01:00:33,286
Got a little present for you.

898
01:00:33,447 --> 01:00:35,597
- You an NBA scout?
- It'll change your life.

899
01:00:35,767 --> 01:00:37,917
- Yeah?
- I'll be in touch.

900
01:00:40,287 --> 01:00:42,755
Millie Dupree,
married 18 years to Hoppy Dupree...

901
01:00:42,927 --> 01:00:44,121
Hey, Hoppy.

902
01:00:44,287 --> 01:00:46,926
<i>...one</i> of the city's more
unprincipled real-estate agents.

903
01:00:47,087 --> 01:00:48,566
Okay. Nice meeting you.

904
01:00:48,727 --> 01:00:50,206
Mr. Ringwald has set the bait.

905
01:00:50,367 --> 01:00:54,918
Mr. Ringwald, if anybody can help you
walk that land deal through, it'd be me.

906
01:00:55,087 --> 01:00:57,442
<i>Owens and Strode are about</i>
<i>to close the snare.</i>

907
01:00:57,607 --> 01:01:00,280
Is that convincing enough for you?

908
01:01:00,967 --> 01:01:02,685
- Freeze! Nobody move!
- FBI.

909
01:01:02,847 --> 01:01:05,281
- Sit down! Back in that chair!
- Hands on the table.

910
01:01:05,447 --> 01:01:07,483
Hoppy Dupree, you're under arrest.

911
01:01:07,647 --> 01:01:11,481
You're in violation of federal code,
attempting to bribe a government official.

912
01:01:12,407 --> 01:01:16,400
Mr. Kincaid, you want to tell the court
just a little bit about your schooling?

913
01:01:16,567 --> 01:01:18,205
Well, not a whole lot to tell.

914
01:01:18,367 --> 01:01:20,358
I mean, most people
got a college degree.

915
01:01:20,527 --> 01:01:23,678
And about the only thing I'd ever get
was the third degrees.

916
01:01:23,847 --> 01:01:27,726
I appreciate your sense of humor,
but let's try to stay more on the topic.

917
01:01:27,887 --> 01:01:31,357
Stay more on Kyle Murphy
and his shop, Excalibur Guns.

918
01:01:31,527 --> 01:01:34,917
When you went there to get your
shipment, did Kyle Murphy ever say:

919
01:01:35,087 --> 01:01:39,399
"We're out," or "Why do you need 25
assault-style pistols in a month?"

920
01:01:39,647 --> 01:01:42,320
- Anything like that?
- No, he never said that.

921
01:01:42,487 --> 01:01:44,762
- He always had plenty of guns around.
- Gotcha.

922
01:01:44,927 --> 01:01:47,646
Thank you, Mr. Kincaid. Your witness.

923
01:01:48,127 --> 01:01:51,642
Mr. Kincaid, you were the one
who sold the gun...

924
01:01:51,807 --> 01:01:55,083
...used by Kevin Peltier in the
brokerage-house shootings, correct?

925
01:01:55,327 --> 01:01:57,522
Correct. And I did a stretch for that too.

926
01:01:57,727 --> 01:01:59,001
He'll help us get there.

927
01:01:59,167 --> 01:02:01,635
To your knowledge,
was Vicksburg Firearms aware...

928
01:02:01,807 --> 01:02:04,560
...that you were out there
reselling their product?

929
01:02:09,407 --> 01:02:11,921
No. Not to my knowledge.

930
01:02:13,487 --> 01:02:15,079
He flipped on us.

931
01:02:15,247 --> 01:02:18,239
So Vicksburg Firearms
never sent you on any trips...

932
01:02:18,407 --> 01:02:24,437
...or endorsed or fostered you selling
their guns in any way, is that correct?

933
01:02:24,607 --> 01:02:29,044
Yeah, that's correct. But I wish they
had. I wish they had endorsed me...

934
01:02:29,327 --> 01:02:30,601
...like they did Kyle.

935
01:02:30,767 --> 01:02:33,645
Because I saw some pictures
from a trip he took to Cancun.

936
01:02:33,807 --> 01:02:36,241
Man, Murph and Turf
were living it up down there.

937
01:02:36,407 --> 01:02:37,965
I wish they'd sent me.

938
01:02:38,127 --> 01:02:41,085
I'd have been on a beach with them,
looking at some thongs...

939
01:02:41,247 --> 01:02:43,317
...and sipping on margaritas.

940
01:02:43,487 --> 01:02:46,684
- A simple answer, please.
- My simple answer's <i>no...</i>

941
01:02:48,487 --> 01:02:50,637
And I want it on the record now too.

942
01:02:50,807 --> 01:02:54,846
I didn't have any idea what Peltier
was gonna do with that gun.

943
01:02:55,007 --> 01:02:56,520
He was a wack job.

944
01:02:56,847 --> 01:02:58,485
<i>I wasn 't about getting anyone hurt.</i>

945
01:02:58,687 --> 01:03:01,565
I've retrieved some fragments.
I've got two things.

946
01:03:01,727 --> 01:03:05,276
One: List of registered voters
for Cincinnati.

947
01:03:05,447 --> 01:03:08,041
Why would Easter want a list
of registered voters?

948
01:03:08,207 --> 01:03:11,324
Because voter-registration lists
lead to potential jury pools.

949
01:03:11,487 --> 01:03:14,285
- What else?
- Well, this is from the drive's directory.

950
01:03:14,447 --> 01:03:16,597
Time-stamped the day he got
his jury summons.

951
01:03:16,767 --> 01:03:20,157
He synchronized the data on his drive
to another device.

952
01:03:21,727 --> 01:03:23,399
That's what you should've snagged.

953
01:03:23,807 --> 01:03:27,277
Doyle, you're going back in. This time
I want you to take Mr. Janovich.

954
01:03:30,007 --> 01:03:33,682
- Why do I have to take him?
- Because Mr. Janovich can find anything.

955
01:03:46,847 --> 01:03:48,121
I'm going for it.

956
01:03:48,287 --> 01:03:50,517
Thank you. Thank you. Watch this.

957
01:03:50,687 --> 01:03:52,757
- Nick.
- Got one for me?

958
01:04:03,687 --> 01:04:06,247
Eddie, you seem kind of gloomy.
You all right?

959
01:04:06,407 --> 01:04:11,162
Oh, no. No, I'm fine, man. You know,
I just got a lot on my mind, that's all.

960
01:04:11,487 --> 01:04:15,526
- You okay? You want to talk about it?
- I'm cool.

961
01:04:16,167 --> 01:04:17,885
- Really.
- Okay.

962
01:04:18,047 --> 01:04:22,165
- Here's one more for you, miss.
- Thank you very much.

963
01:04:37,487 --> 01:04:38,840
Sorry, man.

964
01:05:10,367 --> 01:05:12,437
I left my key inside.

965
01:05:30,727 --> 01:05:32,206
Congratulations.

966
01:05:34,527 --> 01:05:35,846
We got it. Let's go.

967
01:05:38,527 --> 01:05:40,483
Janovich, you don't have to do this.

968
01:05:41,087 --> 01:05:43,203
I said, you don't have to do this.

969
01:05:43,367 --> 01:05:45,244
Did you hear me?

970
01:06:08,847 --> 01:06:11,645
Hey, guys. There's something
really wrong with Rikki.

971
01:06:11,807 --> 01:06:13,638
I mean it. Come on.

972
01:06:14,407 --> 01:06:16,284
See? Right there.

973
01:06:20,687 --> 01:06:22,040
Come on, Rikki.

974
01:06:25,847 --> 01:06:28,600
Give me a towel. Give me a paper towel.
Paper towel, now.

975
01:06:29,807 --> 01:06:31,399
Oh, that's nasty.

976
01:06:31,567 --> 01:06:33,922
She's had five shooters. It's no wonder.

977
01:06:39,047 --> 01:06:40,765
- Call for help.
- What? She just...

978
01:06:40,927 --> 01:06:42,519
- Call 911 now!
- Okay, okay.

979
01:06:43,807 --> 01:06:45,399
Damn!

980
01:06:47,927 --> 01:06:49,565
I'm sorry.

981
01:06:51,367 --> 01:06:52,641
I'm sorry, Rikki.

982
01:06:52,807 --> 01:06:56,436
- Is she breathing, Nick?
- Yeah. She's gonna be okay, I think.

983
01:06:59,287 --> 01:07:00,800
I can't believe this.

984
01:07:00,967 --> 01:07:04,516
Damn lucky the place is still here
and no one was hurt.

985
01:07:11,807 --> 01:07:14,526
People can't move back into this place.

986
01:07:35,887 --> 01:07:38,003
They got to Rikki Coleman.

987
01:07:38,167 --> 01:07:41,637
Woman's the president of the PTA.
She bakes cookies for her kids.

988
01:07:41,807 --> 01:07:45,356
Whatever that son of a bitch had on her,
he brought out the heavy lumber.

989
01:07:45,527 --> 01:07:47,563
She swallowed a fistful of sleeping pills.

990
01:07:47,727 --> 01:07:48,955
Who's her replacement?

991
01:07:50,367 --> 01:07:53,962
Who's her...? Did you hear what I said?
She almost killed herself tonight.

992
01:07:54,127 --> 01:07:55,924
I'm sorry.

993
01:07:57,247 --> 01:08:00,842
And they're putting heat on the others.
Eddie Weese and Millie Dupree.

994
01:08:01,007 --> 01:08:02,599
They torched my place tonight.

995
01:08:02,767 --> 01:08:04,564
At least we know
we have them motivated.

996
01:08:05,887 --> 01:08:07,525
Here's the fun part.

997
01:08:07,687 --> 01:08:09,279
They got the MP3 player.

998
01:08:09,767 --> 01:08:11,325
The files are encrypted.

999
01:08:11,487 --> 01:08:14,797
They're encrypted, but these guys
are good. They got teams of people.

1000
01:08:14,967 --> 01:08:18,243
You don't think they'll crack that?
We got three, four days tops...

1001
01:08:18,487 --> 01:08:20,682
...before the walls cave in.

1002
01:08:21,607 --> 01:08:24,041
- Lf we stay.
- Lf we stay?

1003
01:08:24,727 --> 01:08:27,116
What do you mean?
What are you saying to me, Nick?

1004
01:08:27,287 --> 01:08:29,960
- You saying you want to run away?
- Listen, Marlee.

1005
01:08:30,127 --> 01:08:32,561
- People are getting hurt.
- We're inside.

1006
01:08:32,727 --> 01:08:34,001
People could get killed.

1007
01:08:34,167 --> 01:08:36,965
- I'm inside. You're on the street.
- We're in this together.

1008
01:08:37,127 --> 01:08:38,799
It's our job to protect them.

1009
01:08:38,967 --> 01:08:43,040
There's only so much that I can do.
It's not just them that I worry about.

1010
01:08:46,847 --> 01:08:48,963
I can't protect you.

1011
01:08:57,447 --> 01:09:00,041
- Where are we with Rohr?
- He hasn't stepped up yet.

1012
01:09:00,527 --> 01:09:02,279
He will.

1013
01:09:02,847 --> 01:09:04,439
And Fitch wants to meet.

1014
01:09:05,807 --> 01:09:08,116
We knew I'd have to go
face-to-face with him.

1015
01:09:09,807 --> 01:09:11,525
It's okay.

1016
01:09:11,687 --> 01:09:13,723
I can play him. I can...

1017
01:09:15,047 --> 01:09:16,366
Set a date.

1018
01:09:17,687 --> 01:09:19,200
Okay.

1019
01:09:22,527 --> 01:09:25,200
We can't afford to lose any more jurors.

1020
01:09:25,727 --> 01:09:27,524
I know the math.

1021
01:09:27,687 --> 01:09:30,360
We put Fitch on his heels right now.

1022
01:09:33,207 --> 01:09:36,438
This video is from a security camera
inside juror nine's apartment.

1023
01:09:36,607 --> 01:09:38,359
Take a good look.

1024
01:09:41,287 --> 01:09:42,879
<i>Oh, hi. Landlord let me in.</i>

1025
01:09:43,047 --> 01:09:45,720
<i>A lot of people have been</i>
<i>complaining about their cable.</i>

1026
01:09:45,887 --> 01:09:48,242
<i>But I checked yours out.</i>
<i>I don 't think you have...</i>

1027
01:09:48,407 --> 01:09:51,205
Gentlemen, this malfeasance
will not stand.

1028
01:09:51,447 --> 01:09:54,086
I don't know which of you
this man was working for.

1029
01:09:54,247 --> 01:09:55,965
You're lucky I can't see his face.

1030
01:09:56,127 --> 01:09:58,482
I'd be inclined to turn this over
to the DA.

1031
01:09:58,647 --> 01:10:01,081
- Your Honor, I move for a mistrial.
- No, Mr. Cable.

1032
01:10:01,247 --> 01:10:03,158
There's not gonna be a mistrial.
Motion denied.

1033
01:10:03,327 --> 01:10:05,557
Not because of maneuvers like this!

1034
01:10:09,727 --> 01:10:12,924
<i>For the remainder of this trial,</i>
<i>our jury is to be sequestered.</i>

1035
01:10:13,167 --> 01:10:15,727
<i>Bailiff, would you please inform...</i>

1036
01:10:17,807 --> 01:10:20,879
The guy in the video set fire
to Nick Easter's place last night.

1037
01:10:21,047 --> 01:10:23,641
- What?
- Set fire to his place last night.

1038
01:10:23,807 --> 01:10:26,685
- How would you know that?
- Because I was there.

1039
01:10:29,967 --> 01:10:33,721
You were there? You went
to a juror's residence without asking me?

1040
01:10:33,887 --> 01:10:35,161
Wendall, listen to me.

1041
01:10:35,327 --> 01:10:37,477
- We're finished.
- That's what you pay me for.

1042
01:10:37,647 --> 01:10:39,922
You're a young punk.
You should've asked me.

1043
01:10:40,087 --> 01:10:43,443
- You're fired...
- Nick Easter is spinning this jury.

1044
01:10:44,487 --> 01:10:46,717
That's why Fitch ransacked his place.

1045
01:10:46,887 --> 01:10:49,560
There's a twisted power play
going on between these two.

1046
01:10:49,727 --> 01:10:52,924
You're afraid, you tell the judge,
they'll call a mistrial.

1047
01:10:53,087 --> 01:10:55,078
The defense would love nothing more.

1048
01:10:55,247 --> 01:10:59,638
Why hasn't the defense
told the judge about Nick Easter?

1049
01:11:01,927 --> 01:11:04,361
Because they're really
gonna buy this verdict.

1050
01:11:06,207 --> 01:11:08,084
- Bastards.
- Celeste, behind you.

1051
01:11:09,207 --> 01:11:12,802
All right. Hey, Celeste. Henry.

1052
01:11:13,727 --> 01:11:15,319
- Mr. Rohr.
- What's going on?

1053
01:11:15,487 --> 01:11:18,604
That reporter just told me...
She said something about a mistrial.

1054
01:11:18,767 --> 01:11:20,086
No, don't worry about that.

1055
01:11:20,247 --> 01:11:22,602
- She said the judge is...
- No. Now listen to me.

1056
01:11:22,767 --> 01:11:25,679
Everything's fine.
The judge has sequestered the jury.

1057
01:11:25,847 --> 01:11:29,726
- Not unusual for a heated trial...
- You said we had an excellent case.

1058
01:11:30,047 --> 01:11:32,163
- Yes.
- When I met with you a year ago...

1059
01:11:32,327 --> 01:11:35,478
...you said we could change the way
these people do business.

1060
01:11:35,647 --> 01:11:40,004
That my husband's life,
that all of those lives wouldn't <i>be...</i>

1061
01:11:40,167 --> 01:11:41,680
What?

1062
01:11:42,487 --> 01:11:45,047
- What's the matter, celeste?
- I just need to hear it.

1063
01:11:47,647 --> 01:11:50,605
- Tell me we can win this.
- We can.

1064
01:11:52,007 --> 01:11:53,565
We are gonna win it.

1065
01:11:54,527 --> 01:11:56,757
- Okay.
- Okay?

1066
01:11:57,247 --> 01:11:59,317
- Come on, Henry.
- You going to the park?

1067
01:11:59,487 --> 01:12:01,637
- Yeah.
- We'll see you later.

1068
01:12:07,207 --> 01:12:10,882
I got Easter's list of potential jurors.
Boston, Pittsburgh and Cincinnati.

1069
01:12:11,287 --> 01:12:14,757
- What are the dates?
- Boston, 2000. Pittsburgh, Brooklyn, '99.

1070
01:12:14,927 --> 01:12:18,806
- And cincinnati, '98.
- They've been stalking gun cases.

1071
01:12:19,407 --> 01:12:21,398
Now they're in the house.

1072
01:12:21,927 --> 01:12:23,485
All right.

1073
01:12:24,167 --> 01:12:27,557
Amanda, I want the jury files
on all four cities. I want them tonight.

1074
01:12:27,727 --> 01:12:29,399
Line two. It's her.

1075
01:12:33,247 --> 01:12:38,241
Good afternoon, Marlee. I see you and
Mr. Easter are keeping busy, busy, busy.

1076
01:12:38,407 --> 01:12:43,435
<i>The Palace Café on Canal Street.</i>
<i>Downstairs, dining room, 15 minutes.</i>

1077
01:12:50,847 --> 01:12:52,439
Thank you.

1078
01:13:13,567 --> 01:13:16,127
- Mr. Fitch?
- Marlee? Good.

1079
01:13:16,287 --> 01:13:19,359
I just won a bet with myself.
I figured you for blond.

1080
01:13:20,327 --> 01:13:22,238
Oh, please, have a seat.

1081
01:13:23,287 --> 01:13:25,357
Nice massé, sequestering the jury.

1082
01:13:25,527 --> 01:13:27,802
Close ranks, makes them harder to...

1083
01:13:37,407 --> 01:13:39,637
- Mr. Fitch?
- Yes.

1084
01:13:39,807 --> 01:13:42,002
- This is for you.
- Thank you.

1085
01:14:19,887 --> 01:14:22,003
- What's your price?
- Ten million.

1086
01:14:23,527 --> 01:14:25,802
Non-negotiable.

1087
01:14:28,287 --> 01:14:30,676
This is made out to cash.

1088
01:14:30,847 --> 01:14:33,281
Five hundred thousand dollars...

1089
01:14:33,447 --> 01:14:34,960
...to walk away from my jury.

1090
01:14:36,527 --> 01:14:39,485
I wouldn't drop off
your dry cleaning for that.

1091
01:14:43,247 --> 01:14:46,364
You want to ask Nick about that?

1092
01:14:46,807 --> 01:14:50,402
Okay, okay. How do I know
that you can provide the verdict?

1093
01:14:50,567 --> 01:14:52,922
We got the jury sequestered, didn't we?

1094
01:14:53,087 --> 01:14:55,920
We know you're leaning
on a couple jurors. It's not enough.

1095
01:14:56,087 --> 01:14:57,805
You need nine warm bodies.

1096
01:14:57,967 --> 01:15:00,401
Nick Easter can deliver them.
He's very persuasive.

1097
01:15:01,087 --> 01:15:04,477
- You're such a good hustler.
- You're a good arsonist.

1098
01:15:04,647 --> 01:15:06,603
We both know what's at stake here.

1099
01:15:06,767 --> 01:15:11,124
You lose this, every civil lawyer in the
country's gonna be holding out his hand.

1100
01:15:12,847 --> 01:15:14,121
This is mine.

1101
01:15:14,847 --> 01:15:16,678
You won't get off until the next stop.

1102
01:15:17,167 --> 01:15:18,885
It's the zoo.

1103
01:15:22,887 --> 01:15:26,562
I'm gonna give you a second chance
to take this. I want you to consider it.

1104
01:15:26,927 --> 01:15:29,236
I think it's fair. I do.

1105
01:15:29,847 --> 01:15:31,075
I really do.

1106
01:15:32,247 --> 01:15:33,999
Listen, Fitch.

1107
01:15:34,167 --> 01:15:36,761
When you're ready to pony up the <i>10...</i>

1108
01:15:36,927 --> 01:15:40,283
...e- mail me at this address.
It's a free account. Untraceable.

1109
01:15:40,447 --> 01:15:42,915
But then I'm sure you already knew that.

1110
01:16:17,727 --> 01:16:19,080
Here you are, sir.

1111
01:16:19,247 --> 01:16:21,397
Okay, I get this
"being sequestered" part.

1112
01:16:21,567 --> 01:16:24,525
But why put us all the way out here
by the east Texas border?

1113
01:16:24,687 --> 01:16:27,485
Hell, I can see Port Arthur
from the parking lot.

1114
01:16:27,647 --> 01:16:29,558
Does anyone know how Rikki's doing?

1115
01:16:29,727 --> 01:16:32,287
She was released
from the hospital an hour ago.

1116
01:16:32,447 --> 01:16:34,085
Lovely girl. Seemed fine to me.

1117
01:16:34,287 --> 01:16:37,359
But you never really know
what's going on with a person.

1118
01:16:37,527 --> 01:16:40,599
- Could be her marriage...
- No, no, no, it was nothing like that.

1119
01:16:40,767 --> 01:16:43,122
- Somebody got to that girl.
- No, that's hokum.

1120
01:16:43,287 --> 01:16:46,723
- Why would anyone want to get to her?
- Same reason they want to get us.

1121
01:16:46,887 --> 01:16:49,526
- To influence the outcome of the trial.
- Are we safe?

1122
01:16:49,687 --> 01:16:52,599
- Okay, here are your keys.
- We are now.

1123
01:16:58,047 --> 01:17:00,402
Hoppy was arrested.

1124
01:17:00,567 --> 01:17:03,479
And they said they would
put him in jail for life...

1125
01:17:03,647 --> 01:17:06,878
<i>...if</i> I didn't vote in favor
of the gun company.

1126
01:17:07,047 --> 01:17:09,117
It's okay, sweetheart.

1127
01:17:11,807 --> 01:17:15,004
- We'll talk about it in the morning.
- Thanks. Good night.

1128
01:17:23,007 --> 01:17:25,919
Didn't take you for a man
who goes for the big girls, Easter.

1129
01:17:26,087 --> 01:17:28,681
You're just full of surprises, ain't you?

1130
01:17:29,327 --> 01:17:30,760
I'm fine, Frank. How are you?

1131
01:17:35,487 --> 01:17:38,206
- Can I get by?
- I've been watching you, Easter.

1132
01:17:38,367 --> 01:17:41,723
- From day one.
- I just want to go to my room, Frank.

1133
01:17:41,887 --> 01:17:43,923
You're a real Boy Scout, aren't you?

1134
01:17:44,767 --> 01:17:49,079
Playing everybody.
Playing the judge. Playing Millie?

1135
01:17:49,247 --> 01:17:51,920
I've put up with guys like you
my whole life.

1136
01:17:52,087 --> 01:17:55,204
Now, I want you
to understand something.

1137
01:17:55,967 --> 01:17:57,480
Okay?

1138
01:17:57,967 --> 01:18:00,356
I don't like my hand being forced.

1139
01:18:01,447 --> 01:18:03,403
Do you understand?

1140
01:18:06,567 --> 01:18:08,319
Get some sleep, Frank.

1141
01:18:41,087 --> 01:18:42,805
Mr. Rohr?

1142
01:18:47,247 --> 01:18:49,602
May I sit down?

1143
01:18:49,767 --> 01:18:52,361
- I know you're playing both sides.
- We are.

1144
01:18:54,327 --> 01:18:55,601
May I sit down?

1145
01:18:57,087 --> 01:18:58,645
Yeah, go on. Sit down, sit down.

1146
01:19:04,927 --> 01:19:06,883
Now, you tell me...

1147
01:19:07,487 --> 01:19:10,445
You tell me why I shouldn't
go to the judge, get a mistrial...

1148
01:19:10,607 --> 01:19:13,997
...and have that provocative
little bottom of yours thrown into jail.

1149
01:19:14,167 --> 01:19:17,125
Do you know how serious we are
about jury tampering down here?

1150
01:19:17,287 --> 01:19:19,005
- You wouldn't.
- Don't be so sure.

1151
01:19:19,167 --> 01:19:21,965
You wouldn't put Mrs. Wood
through the pain of a mistrial.

1152
01:19:22,127 --> 01:19:25,164
You don't know anything
about Celeste Wood, what drives her.

1153
01:19:25,327 --> 01:19:27,477
Unlike you, she's not in it for the money.

1154
01:19:27,647 --> 01:19:30,036
And what are you in it for, Mr. Rohr?

1155
01:19:30,207 --> 01:19:31,845
Oh, you're something, aren't you?

1156
01:19:32,127 --> 01:19:34,516
- What do you think I'm in it for?
- You tell me.

1157
01:19:34,927 --> 01:19:37,839
- I'd like to get the law changed.
- That's why you're here.

1158
01:19:38,007 --> 01:19:39,520
But you need help.

1159
01:19:39,687 --> 01:19:42,520
It's up to you. You can be a good boy,
play by the rules...

1160
01:19:42,687 --> 01:19:46,077
...or you can win a huge victory
for gun control. The choice is yours.

1161
01:19:46,247 --> 01:19:48,920
This may surprise you.
I don't have to make that choice.

1162
01:19:49,087 --> 01:19:51,043
Your whistle blower is gonna testify...

1163
01:19:51,207 --> 01:19:54,677
...his company knows about the guns
that wind up on the black market...?

1164
01:19:54,847 --> 01:19:56,121
That's right, precisely.

1165
01:19:56,287 --> 01:19:59,279
What makes you think this witness
will make it to the stand?

1166
01:19:59,447 --> 01:20:03,042
- That whistle blower came to us.
- No. Fitch is gonna get to him.

1167
01:20:03,207 --> 01:20:05,721
He's your star witness.
If he hasn't already, you...

1168
01:20:05,887 --> 01:20:08,845
Sweetheart! Hey! Hey! Hey!

1169
01:20:12,607 --> 01:20:14,837
He came to us.
He's tucked away right now.

1170
01:20:15,007 --> 01:20:16,406
I'm not gonna tell you where.

1171
01:20:16,567 --> 01:20:21,243
The man, out of conscience, cannot wait
to get on that stand and testify.

1172
01:20:22,847 --> 01:20:25,077
Anyone can be gotten to.

1173
01:20:26,887 --> 01:20:28,684
What do you know?

1174
01:20:30,407 --> 01:20:33,877
How much we talking about here?
What do you want to bleed me for?

1175
01:20:34,047 --> 01:20:35,924
Five, six, seven million?

1176
01:20:36,087 --> 01:20:39,363
- Ten million.
- Oh, that's a big number.

1177
01:20:40,487 --> 01:20:42,284
That's a big number.

1178
01:20:43,287 --> 01:20:45,562
With Rankin Fitch in the game,
you can't win.

1179
01:20:46,287 --> 01:20:50,200
So if you just match his offer,
I'm gonna swing it your way.

1180
01:20:50,527 --> 01:20:52,358
Goodbye.

1181
01:20:54,727 --> 01:20:56,001
Who hurt you?

1182
01:20:57,887 --> 01:20:59,878
What made you this way?

1183
01:21:00,887 --> 01:21:02,878
You know what you're
messing with here?

1184
01:21:03,047 --> 01:21:04,765
You know how important this is?

1185
01:21:18,127 --> 01:21:22,245
We've been poring over those jury files.
We found this in the Cincinnati stack.

1186
01:21:22,407 --> 01:21:24,284
He used the name David Lancaster.

1187
01:21:24,847 --> 01:21:28,806
He was prospective juror number 54,
but he didn't make it on.

1188
01:21:30,127 --> 01:21:31,719
Call Doyle. Tell him to pack.

1189
01:21:31,887 --> 01:21:34,003
He'll be on the first flight to cincinnati.

1190
01:21:34,167 --> 01:21:37,159
Let's see if Mr. Lancaster's
left any loose ends behind.

1191
01:21:37,367 --> 01:21:40,564
Everybody's got a dirty little secret.
Let's find out what his is.

1192
01:21:43,247 --> 01:21:46,000
- Where the hell is he?
- He was in his room an hour ago.

1193
01:21:46,167 --> 01:21:48,522
I know. I thought you had
someone babysitting.

1194
01:21:48,687 --> 01:21:51,645
- I'll keep trying the hotel.
- Find him. Get him here.

1195
01:21:51,807 --> 01:21:54,196
Mr. Rohr, is everything all right
down there?

1196
01:21:54,367 --> 01:21:55,800
Everything's fine, Your Honor.

1197
01:21:55,967 --> 01:21:59,357
You called Mr. Kriegler 10 minutes ago.
Could we show him in, please?

1198
01:21:59,527 --> 01:22:01,165
Your Honor...

1199
01:22:01,607 --> 01:22:04,644
- Your Honor, may I approach?
- You may. Mr. Cable.

1200
01:22:05,087 --> 01:22:07,317
You let me know when he finds him.

1201
01:22:09,207 --> 01:22:12,324
Your Honor, I'd like to request
a brief adjournment at this time.

1202
01:22:12,487 --> 01:22:16,241
- Where's your witness, Mr. Rohr?
- We're looking... We're looking into that.

1203
01:22:16,407 --> 01:22:20,320
- Request for an adjournment is denied.
- Your Honor, this is my key witness.

1204
01:22:20,487 --> 01:22:22,523
You should've kept
a tighter leash on him.

1205
01:22:22,687 --> 01:22:25,406
I told you both,
I won't stand for any more foolishness.

1206
01:22:25,567 --> 01:22:27,603
- We will proceed on schedule.
- Your Honor...

1207
01:22:27,767 --> 01:22:31,123
Mr. Rohr, is there another request
you'd like to make at this time?

1208
01:22:31,287 --> 01:22:34,279
It would be highly prejudicial
if we are not permitted...

1209
01:22:34,447 --> 01:22:37,166
I'll take that as a motion
for reconsideration. Denied.

1210
01:22:37,327 --> 01:22:38,646
Call your next witness.

1211
01:22:39,207 --> 01:22:42,802
- Call your next witness, Mr. Rohr.
- I have no next witness.

1212
01:22:42,967 --> 01:22:46,516
If so, Mr. Rohr, then plaintiff rests.
Thank you, gentlemen.

1213
01:23:14,367 --> 01:23:15,686
Wendall Rohr.

1214
01:23:16,287 --> 01:23:18,357
An overdue pleasure.

1215
01:23:18,527 --> 01:23:20,279
Rankin Fitch.

1216
01:23:21,687 --> 01:23:24,997
Nice suit. V ery "of the people."

1217
01:23:25,447 --> 01:23:28,245
Yours is nicer. You call it,
"gun lobby protecting its own"?

1218
01:23:28,407 --> 01:23:29,556
Swank shoes.

1219
01:23:30,367 --> 01:23:33,677
- Big tobacco?
- Big alligator. Wrestled it myself.

1220
01:23:35,127 --> 01:23:37,482
Excuse me, we're cleaning up in here.

1221
01:23:39,127 --> 01:23:41,721
- Am I gonna get beat up?
- What'd you do to my witness?

1222
01:23:41,887 --> 01:23:45,596
Threaten his family, write a check?
Just curious what your technique is.

1223
01:23:46,167 --> 01:23:49,716
Maybe he decided against
biting the hand that fed him.

1224
01:23:49,887 --> 01:23:51,718
You know exactly why he came to us.

1225
01:23:51,887 --> 01:23:55,846
Oh, please, don't tell me you hung
your case on somebody's conscience.

1226
01:23:56,007 --> 01:23:58,999
I hung my case on my own conscience.

1227
01:23:59,927 --> 01:24:01,406
I get it now.

1228
01:24:01,567 --> 01:24:05,799
You are a moral man living in a world
of moral relativity. It's just so quaint.

1229
01:24:05,967 --> 01:24:07,446
- So precious.
- Don't do that!

1230
01:24:07,607 --> 01:24:10,599
This is about my witness
and you messing with my client...

1231
01:24:10,767 --> 01:24:13,565
...my case and the rules of law
that govern our country.

1232
01:24:13,727 --> 01:24:15,001
- Our country?
- Yes!

1233
01:24:15,167 --> 01:24:17,078
I didn't figure you for a patriot.

1234
01:24:17,247 --> 01:24:21,445
With your disregard for people's right
to bear arms. "Second Amendment"?

1235
01:24:21,607 --> 01:24:23,802
You're doing this to protect
the Constitution?

1236
01:24:23,967 --> 01:24:26,925
Of course not. I'm in it to win.
Just like you are.

1237
01:24:27,087 --> 01:24:30,284
That's what I was hired to do.
Everything else is colored bubbles.

1238
01:24:30,447 --> 01:24:33,200
Colored bubbles?! Colored bubbles?

1239
01:24:33,367 --> 01:24:38,521
A system that calls for 12 people to sit
and listen to testimony of witnesses.

1240
01:24:38,687 --> 01:24:41,679
And that includes my witness,
who you've disappeared.

1241
01:24:41,847 --> 01:24:45,840
If you're relying on testimony to win
this case, you've already lost it, fella.

1242
01:24:46,007 --> 01:24:50,046
You think this jury cares anything about
negligent distribution, product liability?

1243
01:24:50,207 --> 01:24:51,435
You bet they do!

1244
01:24:51,607 --> 01:24:54,599
They can't say the words,
let alone understand the meaning.

1245
01:24:54,767 --> 01:24:57,281
Think your average juror
is King Solomon? No.

1246
01:24:57,447 --> 01:24:59,005
He's a roofer with a mortgage.

1247
01:24:59,167 --> 01:25:01,397
He wants to go home,
sit in his Barcalounger...

1248
01:25:01,567 --> 01:25:03,637
...and let the cable TV wash over him.

1249
01:25:03,807 --> 01:25:08,483
This man doesn't give a single, solitary
droplet of shit about truth, justice...

1250
01:25:08,647 --> 01:25:10,399
...or your American way.

1251
01:25:11,687 --> 01:25:15,043
- They're people, Fitch.
- My point exactly.

1252
01:25:15,207 --> 01:25:20,042
You don't have an idea of what
I've been talking about, do you, sir?

1253
01:25:20,327 --> 01:25:22,238
What do you hope to achieve
if you win?

1254
01:25:22,407 --> 01:25:26,036
- What do you mean?
- Bring Jacob Wood back to life? No.

1255
01:25:26,247 --> 01:25:29,922
You just ensure that his wife
goes to the cemetery in a better car.

1256
01:25:30,087 --> 01:25:32,920
That the heel that she snaps
on the way to the graveside...

1257
01:25:33,087 --> 01:25:37,160
...belongs to a $ 1200 shoe.
And you get your name in the paper.

1258
01:25:37,887 --> 01:25:41,482
But Jacob Wood
and all the other gun-violence victims...

1259
01:25:41,647 --> 01:25:46,084
...remain rotting in their crypts.

1260
01:25:47,807 --> 01:25:50,116
You know what, Fitch?

1261
01:25:50,287 --> 01:25:52,437
- You're gonna lose.
- I doubt it.

1262
01:25:52,607 --> 01:25:55,519
Well, maybe not this case,
maybe not the next, but someday.

1263
01:25:55,687 --> 01:25:58,520
You know, someday.
I've seen it before with guys like you.

1264
01:25:59,007 --> 01:26:00,884
- You wanna know why?
- Why?

1265
01:26:01,047 --> 01:26:04,596
Because you cannot carry that much
contempt without it becoming malignant.

1266
01:26:04,767 --> 01:26:07,486
Until you'll be all alone
in a room full of shadows...

1267
01:26:07,647 --> 01:26:09,319
<i>...and</i> all you're gonna <i>have...</i>

1268
01:26:09,487 --> 01:26:12,445
...is the memories of all those lives
you have destroyed.

1269
01:26:12,847 --> 01:26:15,042
Well, that's a good story, Wendall.

1270
01:26:15,207 --> 01:26:18,279
But it's just further proof
of why you can't beat me.

1271
01:26:18,447 --> 01:26:21,200
Because you may be right...

1272
01:26:21,367 --> 01:26:24,916
...but the thing of it is,
I don't give a shit.

1273
01:26:25,367 --> 01:26:27,005
What's <i>more...</i>

1274
01:26:27,167 --> 01:26:28,998
...I never have.

1275
01:26:31,647 --> 01:26:32,921
That suit.

1276
01:26:39,807 --> 01:26:41,957
<i>- Good evening, Wendall.</i>
<i>- George. Mason.</i>

1277
01:26:45,607 --> 01:26:46,926
So...

1278
01:26:47,087 --> 01:26:49,521
...what's this about?

1279
01:26:52,287 --> 01:26:56,963
I'm going to need access
to the firm's emergency reserve.

1280
01:26:57,127 --> 01:26:59,004
- Emergency reserve?
- Yeah.

1281
01:26:59,167 --> 01:27:01,806
- In what amount?
- Ten million.

1282
01:27:07,647 --> 01:27:12,767
Gentlemen, I've lost my footing
in this trial.

1283
01:27:25,407 --> 01:27:28,558
- I'm looking for a David Lancaster.
- Are you a bill collector?

1284
01:27:28,727 --> 01:27:31,036
I work for Dodge,
tracking people down...

1285
01:27:31,207 --> 01:27:33,846
...who have rebates they
forgot to apply for.

1286
01:27:34,847 --> 01:27:37,884
I don't know where he went.
No forwarding address.

1287
01:27:38,047 --> 01:27:40,515
Wish I did, though.
Got this letter for him.

1288
01:27:41,487 --> 01:27:44,240
- Kept it right here.
- Wow, can I take a look at that?

1289
01:27:45,727 --> 01:27:48,002
"Jeff Kerr, care of David Lancaster."

1290
01:27:48,167 --> 01:27:50,476
- You know Jeff Kerr?
- No.

1291
01:27:50,927 --> 01:27:53,805
"Professor Frank Phelan
at Bloomington University."

1292
01:27:56,287 --> 01:27:59,279
I could maybe split the rebate
with you, if you wanted to...

1293
01:28:01,927 --> 01:28:03,406
Jeff Kerr.

1294
01:28:04,847 --> 01:28:06,121
Jeff Kerr.

1295
01:28:08,607 --> 01:28:10,359
David Lancaster.

1296
01:28:10,567 --> 01:28:12,956
Lots of aliases.

1297
01:28:13,847 --> 01:28:16,077
Jeffrey Kerr.

1298
01:28:22,647 --> 01:28:25,081
Hello there, Jeffrey.

1299
01:28:28,287 --> 01:28:30,198
So as CEO of Vicksburg Firearms...

1300
01:28:30,367 --> 01:28:33,643
...you were unaware that your product
was being sold illegally?

1301
01:28:33,807 --> 01:28:35,604
Yes, sir. Absolutely, sir.

1302
01:28:35,767 --> 01:28:38,565
Mr. Jankle, are you a family man?

1303
01:28:38,727 --> 01:28:43,118
Yes, sir, I am. I have a son.
I have an 8-year-old grandson.

1304
01:28:43,287 --> 01:28:45,198
Anything else you'd like to add?

1305
01:28:45,367 --> 01:28:47,278
The Second Amendment...

1306
01:28:47,447 --> 01:28:50,917
...permits every good citizen
of this country to keep and bear arms.

1307
01:28:51,087 --> 01:28:53,123
We at Vicksburg Firearms
didn't write <i>it...</i>

1308
01:28:53,287 --> 01:28:57,326
<i>...but</i> as long as it stands, we'll continue
to operate under its protections.

1309
01:28:57,487 --> 01:29:00,763
- Thank you, sir. Nothing further.
- Counselor.

1310
01:29:01,247 --> 01:29:03,556
Mr. Rohr, do you care to cross?

1311
01:29:03,727 --> 01:29:06,366
- Yes, Your Honor.
- Proceed.

1312
01:29:10,367 --> 01:29:12,278
- Now, Mr. Jankle.
- Yes, sir.

1313
01:29:12,447 --> 01:29:16,156
The ad copy used to sell the Performa
990, read it to the court, please.

1314
01:29:16,327 --> 01:29:17,806
It's right there, counselor.

1315
01:29:17,967 --> 01:29:20,879
The jury would like to hear it
from the head of the company.

1316
01:29:21,047 --> 01:29:23,197
If you could start with
"Also available in."

1317
01:29:23,367 --> 01:29:25,722
"Also available
in a print-resistant finish."

1318
01:29:25,887 --> 01:29:27,161
I see. Who in your mind...

1319
01:29:27,327 --> 01:29:28,840
...might be eager to purchase...

1320
01:29:29,007 --> 01:29:31,760
...a Performa 990 semiautomatic
assault-type weapon...

1321
01:29:31,927 --> 01:29:34,395
...in a fingerprint-resistant finish?

1322
01:29:34,567 --> 01:29:36,159
- Anybody.
- Anybody?

1323
01:29:36,327 --> 01:29:39,444
Fingerprints are <i>90°/.</i> water.
Water corrodes metal. Metal rusts.

1324
01:29:39,607 --> 01:29:42,599
Wouldn't it be more appropriate then
to use "rustproof" <i>...</i>

1325
01:29:42,767 --> 01:29:46,237
<i>...than</i> "fingerprint-resistant"
when you sell it to the general public?

1326
01:29:46,407 --> 01:29:49,399
Well, I didn't write the copy
for that advertisement, sir.

1327
01:29:49,567 --> 01:29:52,286
- Did you see it?
- Objection. Prejudicial.

1328
01:29:52,447 --> 01:29:54,165
Sustained. Mr. Rohr.

1329
01:29:54,647 --> 01:29:56,285
My apologies, Your Honor.

1330
01:29:56,447 --> 01:29:58,039
- Now, Mr. Jankle.
- Yes, sir.

1331
01:29:58,207 --> 01:30:02,246
How much of Vicksburg profits come
from assault-type weapons?

1332
01:30:02,407 --> 01:30:06,036
Oh, I have to apologize to you,
I'm not familiar with that percentage.

1333
01:30:06,207 --> 01:30:09,005
But you are familiar with who buys
a weapon of this sort?

1334
01:30:09,167 --> 01:30:12,603
- The gun's intended for recreational use.
- Farmers, weekend sportsmen?

1335
01:30:12,767 --> 01:30:15,156
- Home protection.
- Or disgruntled day traders...

1336
01:30:15,327 --> 01:30:17,887
- Objection, Your Honor.
- We sell these guns legally.

1337
01:30:18,047 --> 01:30:20,925
Come on, you know that this gun
is favored by criminals.

1338
01:30:21,087 --> 01:30:23,885
- Statistics show that.
- That is up to law enforcement.

1339
01:30:24,047 --> 01:30:25,560
So that's not your problem.

1340
01:30:25,727 --> 01:30:28,195
- Objection.
- It is the government's responsibility.

1341
01:30:28,367 --> 01:30:31,882
Tell the jury that it's not your problem.
Say it to Celeste Wood...

1342
01:30:32,047 --> 01:30:35,596
...who lost her husband,
that it's not your problem.

1343
01:30:35,767 --> 01:30:37,644
- Tell the people...
- You amaze me.

1344
01:30:37,807 --> 01:30:40,560
...that the print-resistant finish
is not your problem!

1345
01:30:40,727 --> 01:30:43,878
I stand on the Second Amendment,
goddamn it!

1346
01:30:56,807 --> 01:30:58,559
We've got damage-control <i>strategies...</i>

1347
01:30:58,727 --> 01:31:00,922
...and your testimony
before cross was strong.

1348
01:31:01,087 --> 01:31:05,239
Oh, you! I mean, you are the one that
told me denial was the route to take.

1349
01:31:05,407 --> 01:31:07,159
- I was improperly prepped.
- Look...

1350
01:31:07,327 --> 01:31:09,887
You, get out of here.

1351
01:31:10,447 --> 01:31:13,166
Mr. Fitch, I looked in the faces
of those jurors.

1352
01:31:13,327 --> 01:31:16,239
I didn't see friends.
Where are we with securing my verdict?

1353
01:31:16,407 --> 01:31:18,967
It's a cat-and-mouse game.
We're about to change...

1354
01:31:19,127 --> 01:31:23,564
You just be a little more cat,
little less mouse.

1355
01:31:23,767 --> 01:31:25,723
Yes, sir.

1356
01:31:35,607 --> 01:31:36,926
- Hello, Marlee.
- <i>Hello, Rankin.</i>

1357
01:31:37,087 --> 01:31:38,315
I'm ready to make a deal.

1358
01:31:38,487 --> 01:31:40,125
<i>I'll meet your terms.</i>

1359
01:31:40,287 --> 01:31:42,517
I'll pay you the money.

1360
01:31:42,687 --> 01:31:46,123
- I wanna meet Nick Easter.
- Won't happen.

1361
01:31:46,287 --> 01:31:49,643
Wendall doesn't need to meet him.
Besides, you know he's sequestered.

1362
01:31:49,807 --> 01:31:53,277
Well, fine. How about his pal,
Jeffrey Kerr?

1363
01:31:54,887 --> 01:31:57,276
<i>Now, we meet or there's no deal.</i>

1364
01:31:57,447 --> 01:32:00,678
Non-negotiable. What's it gonna be?

1365
01:33:16,007 --> 01:33:21,206
I hope you don't mind. I was waiting
so long, I made a sandwich.

1366
01:33:26,967 --> 01:33:29,162
It's a fine piece, Nick.

1367
01:33:29,327 --> 01:33:34,845
- Longines hunter case, circa 1908.
- 1910, actually.

1368
01:33:35,007 --> 01:33:38,124
- You filming this?
- No, no, no, I couldn't use it.

1369
01:33:38,287 --> 01:33:41,404
- Neither of us wants a mistrial.
- No.

1370
01:33:41,567 --> 01:33:43,285
Can we walk?

1371
01:33:43,447 --> 01:33:47,406
Our bus is leaving at 8 a.m.,
so that gives us a little time together.

1372
01:33:50,127 --> 01:33:52,482
Marlee, please come out of the kitchen.

1373
01:33:53,007 --> 01:33:55,646
I'm not here to hurt you.

1374
01:33:56,607 --> 01:33:59,838
Please, sweetheart, sit down. Relax.

1375
01:34:00,007 --> 01:34:03,158
So, what, I'm supposed to convince you
that I have them, right?

1376
01:34:03,327 --> 01:34:06,080
Oh, I think you've probably got them
or you will have.

1377
01:34:06,247 --> 01:34:09,603
- I just want to know why.
- Money.

1378
01:34:09,767 --> 01:34:15,000
Safer ways for a sharp kid like you
to make money. What's the real reason?

1379
01:34:15,167 --> 01:34:18,204
Business, politics, sports.
You tell me what isn't rigged.

1380
01:34:18,367 --> 01:34:20,597
Is there such a thing
as an objective jury?

1381
01:34:20,767 --> 01:34:21,995
Not if I can help it.

1382
01:34:22,167 --> 01:34:25,603
Then why should the lawyers
and guys like you make all the profit?

1383
01:34:25,767 --> 01:34:28,679
- You don't have much faith in the law.
- I'm agnostic.

1384
01:34:29,567 --> 01:34:32,764
I knew there was something
I liked about you.

1385
01:34:33,167 --> 01:34:34,441
And Marlee?

1386
01:34:36,287 --> 01:34:39,324
- She can tell you her reasons.
- Not what I'm talking about.

1387
01:34:39,487 --> 01:34:41,762
What are you talking about?

1388
01:34:41,927 --> 01:34:43,645
How well do you know her?

1389
01:34:43,967 --> 01:34:46,481
Did you really bring me out here
to talk about her?

1390
01:34:46,647 --> 01:34:48,399
- What's this about?
- Well...

1391
01:34:48,567 --> 01:34:54,085
...tomorrow's the big day,
and we need a little insurance.

1392
01:34:54,247 --> 01:34:55,521
So...

1393
01:34:56,167 --> 01:34:57,395
...let's talk.

1394
01:34:57,687 --> 01:35:01,680
Come on out here,
sit down and talk.

1395
01:35:03,167 --> 01:35:04,441
I'll make you a sandwich.

1396
01:35:55,647 --> 01:35:57,558
I'm ready to pay the money.

1397
01:35:57,727 --> 01:36:00,525
I can have 10 million wire-transferred
to the Caymans...

1398
01:36:00,687 --> 01:36:02,564
...subject to verification,
of course.

1399
01:36:02,727 --> 01:36:05,366
But tell me, who have you got?

1400
01:36:05,527 --> 01:36:08,439
Fernandez, DeShazo, Grimes
and Dupree are in the bag.

1401
01:36:09,047 --> 01:36:11,402
Deets and Duke pretty much
follow the others.

1402
01:36:11,567 --> 01:36:15,845
- Herrera and Shaver are wild cards.
- No, Shaver's taken care of. Weese too.

1403
01:36:16,367 --> 01:36:19,564
Herrera, I wouldn't worry about him.

1404
01:36:21,327 --> 01:36:23,158
Are you gonna swing this my way?

1405
01:36:23,327 --> 01:36:26,524
If you pay, yes, I will.

1406
01:36:26,687 --> 01:36:29,406
Good. Good.

1407
01:36:29,887 --> 01:36:32,276
Tell Marlee I'm ready
to conclude our business.

1408
01:36:32,447 --> 01:36:33,846
Done.

1409
01:36:35,807 --> 01:36:39,004
I must say, I'm impressed, Mr. Kerr.

1410
01:36:39,167 --> 01:36:40,566
- L...
- Easter.

1411
01:36:40,727 --> 01:36:43,287
Easter, correct.

1412
01:36:43,807 --> 01:36:48,881
I didn't see you coming.
Obviously, I underestimated you.

1413
01:36:49,047 --> 01:36:51,959
And as a rule, I don't do that.

1414
01:36:52,927 --> 01:36:57,000
Make damn sure
you don't underestimate me.

1415
01:37:01,727 --> 01:37:04,719
I'm sure one of us will be in touch.

1416
01:37:04,927 --> 01:37:10,081
I have a feeling after tonight,
we're gonna be fast friends.

1417
01:37:29,327 --> 01:37:30,999
Who is it?

1418
01:37:33,967 --> 01:37:35,639
Who is this?

1419
01:37:37,127 --> 01:37:39,880
<i>Bet you didn 't expect to hear</i>
<i>from me so soon.</i>

1420
01:37:40,047 --> 01:37:42,277
Is this a bad time?

1421
01:37:46,327 --> 01:37:48,682
- No, not at all.
- <i>Oh, good.</i>

1422
01:37:50,207 --> 01:37:54,166
Listen, I just wanted you to know
your associate with the accent...

1423
01:37:54,327 --> 01:37:55,806
<i>...he's</i> not coming home tonight.

1424
01:37:57,407 --> 01:37:59,363
At least he won't be walking home.

1425
01:38:02,127 --> 01:38:04,800
And the price just went up.

1426
01:38:06,727 --> 01:38:09,446
Fifteen million, non-negotiable.

1427
01:38:13,447 --> 01:38:15,324
<i>Get some sleep, Rankin.</i>

1428
01:38:15,967 --> 01:38:17,685
You're gonna need it.

1429
01:38:29,007 --> 01:38:30,804
<i>Hey.</i>

1430
01:38:32,767 --> 01:38:35,600
- <i>What's wrong?</i>
- Nothing, I just...

1431
01:38:38,207 --> 01:38:40,243
I just wanted to hear your voice.

1432
01:38:40,887 --> 01:38:42,161
You sure?

1433
01:38:43,567 --> 01:38:44,966
Yeah, I'm sure.

1434
01:38:45,127 --> 01:38:47,641
- <i>I want you to get some sleep.</i>
- Yeah.

1435
01:38:47,807 --> 01:38:51,083
<i>I miss you. Good night.</i>

1436
01:38:58,087 --> 01:39:01,841
<i>Lawyers Wendall Rohr and Derwood</i>
<i>Cable will have their last chances...</i>

1437
01:39:02,007 --> 01:39:06,717
...to strike the winning blow in the case
of <i>Celeste Wood v. Vicksburg Firearms.</i>

1438
01:39:06,887 --> 01:39:08,843
Closing arguments will begin shortly.

1439
01:39:09,007 --> 01:39:11,282
The jury has now heard
all the evidence...

1440
01:39:11,447 --> 01:39:15,076
<i>It's been a very highly-charged trial.</i>
<i>The jury has been sequestered.</i>

1441
01:39:15,247 --> 01:39:17,283
<i>They could begin deliberations today.</i>

1442
01:39:17,447 --> 01:39:20,439
<i>The high-stake decision will soon be</i>
<i>in the hands of the jury.</i>

1443
01:39:20,607 --> 01:39:23,679
<i>This decision could be quick,</i>
<i>with the jury delivering a verdict...</i>

1444
01:39:23,847 --> 01:39:26,839
<i>... perhaps by day's end.</i>

1445
01:39:32,807 --> 01:39:35,002
<i>All Jacob Wood</i>
<i>and those 10 people did...</i>

1446
01:39:35,167 --> 01:39:37,283
<i>... all they did wrong...</i>

1447
01:39:37,447 --> 01:39:41,645
...on that Monday morning
was to go to work.

1448
01:39:42,527 --> 01:39:45,439
There's gonna be another shooting
and another shooting...

1449
01:39:45,607 --> 01:39:50,044
<i>...and</i> it's not gonna let up
until we demand a change.

1450
01:39:50,207 --> 01:39:53,802
You heard Mr. Garland Jankle...

1451
01:39:53,967 --> 01:39:57,118
...the chief CEO of Vicksburg Firearms...

1452
01:39:57,287 --> 01:40:01,883
...sit in that chair and say to you what
we do with his guns is not his problem.

1453
01:40:02,047 --> 01:40:05,722
And he's right. You can make it
his problem with your verdict.

1454
01:40:05,887 --> 01:40:09,277
You may, for the first time...

1455
01:40:09,447 --> 01:40:12,564
...make gun violence...

1456
01:40:13,407 --> 01:40:15,921
<i>...the</i> gun industry's problem.

1457
01:40:16,087 --> 01:40:18,043
If you do...

1458
01:40:18,207 --> 01:40:23,406
...you are going to see
fewer senseless deaths.

1459
01:40:25,847 --> 01:40:29,681
Like my client's husband, Jacob Wood.

1460
01:40:54,607 --> 01:40:56,996
<i>Big wish! Big wish!</i>

1461
01:40:58,807 --> 01:41:00,365
<i>That's my boy.</i>

1462
01:41:13,807 --> 01:41:16,002
<i>Jeff had a real passion for the law.</i>

1463
01:41:16,167 --> 01:41:18,840
He spent the summer
after his first year on a trial.

1464
01:41:19,007 --> 01:41:22,044
The reality of how a big firm
actually practices law...

1465
01:41:22,207 --> 01:41:24,926
...knocked some of the idealistic wind
right out of him.

1466
01:41:25,087 --> 01:41:28,921
Because the following spring, after
Gabby got her undergraduate degree...

1467
01:41:29,087 --> 01:41:31,840
...he dropped out, and they left.
- Did you say Gabby?

1468
01:41:32,007 --> 01:41:35,556
Gabrielle Brandt. She was Jeff's girl
from back home in Gardner.

1469
01:41:35,727 --> 01:41:36,955
Gardner, Indiana?

1470
01:41:37,207 --> 01:41:39,516
<i>Only one I know of.</i>

1471
01:41:40,407 --> 01:41:45,356
Jacob Wood, a man in his prime,
leaves behind a wife and little boy.

1472
01:41:45,527 --> 01:41:46,801
The sadness of that...

1473
01:41:46,967 --> 01:41:50,357
...the incomprehension,
that gives way to anger.

1474
01:41:50,527 --> 01:41:54,759
We must even the score. Not just those
that are directly affected, but all of us.

1475
01:41:54,927 --> 01:41:58,522
We all experience these emotions.

1476
01:41:58,687 --> 01:42:04,159
Which is precisely why the law exists,
to do what is just.

1477
01:42:04,327 --> 01:42:07,205
Now, these families grieve,
and we all grieve for them...

1478
01:42:07,367 --> 01:42:10,279
...but that is all the law
will allow us to do.

1479
01:42:10,567 --> 01:42:12,842
Doyle, where the hell are you?

1480
01:42:13,007 --> 01:42:15,157
Headed for exit 245.

1481
01:42:15,327 --> 01:42:19,400
Some backwater town in central Indiana,
but I think I got a good lead on the girl.

1482
01:42:19,567 --> 01:42:20,841
<i>Well, move it along.</i>

1483
01:42:21,007 --> 01:42:24,158
The judge is about to give this thing
to the jury. Shit.

1484
01:42:24,887 --> 01:42:28,436
Ladies and gentlemen, you've heard
the evidence and arguments of counsel.

1485
01:42:28,607 --> 01:42:32,043
I will give you some instructions,
after which we will hold a recess...

1486
01:42:32,207 --> 01:42:34,163
<i>... and then you will begin deliberations.</i>

1487
01:42:46,767 --> 01:42:48,598
- Wendall Rohr.
- <i>Hello, Wendall.</i>

1488
01:42:48,767 --> 01:42:50,041
Well, hello, Marlee.

1489
01:42:50,207 --> 01:42:53,005
Good to hear your voice.
Did you come up with the money?

1490
01:42:53,167 --> 01:42:56,842
You know, it's amazing how easy it is
to procure $ 10 million.

1491
01:42:57,007 --> 01:43:01,842
It's an interesting exercise.
Ten million dollars, like it was nothing.

1492
01:43:02,407 --> 01:43:07,720
But as bad as I want to win this case,
and I do...

1493
01:43:09,167 --> 01:43:12,239
<i>... after 35 years of doing this,</i>
<i>you know...</i>

1494
01:43:12,407 --> 01:43:15,797
<i>...it's</i> more important that I can
rest my head on the pillow at night.

1495
01:43:16,127 --> 01:43:18,402
- What are you saying?
- I will take my chances.

1496
01:43:18,567 --> 01:43:20,797
I'm not giving you a dime.
Not a dime.

1497
01:43:20,967 --> 01:43:23,242
Well, I am sorry about this.

1498
01:43:23,407 --> 01:43:26,479
- <i>Because you're giving it to Fitch.</i>
- I'm giving it to Fitch?

1499
01:43:26,647 --> 01:43:28,205
I'm gonna take my chances.

1500
01:43:42,607 --> 01:43:46,202
Hello. Hello, there.
I'm sorry to bother you.

1501
01:43:46,367 --> 01:43:48,085
I'm thinking of buying this house.

1502
01:43:48,447 --> 01:43:51,484
My wife and I have a 3-year-old
and another one on the way.

1503
01:43:51,647 --> 01:43:53,603
Is this a good neighborhood for kids?

1504
01:43:53,767 --> 01:43:57,157
Oh, this is a great neighborhood for kids.
I raised my girls here.

1505
01:43:57,327 --> 01:43:58,601
- Oh, really?
- I sure did.

1506
01:43:58,767 --> 01:44:01,361
His life was taken from him.
People were killed...

1507
01:44:01,527 --> 01:44:04,325
...and the gun company made it happen
by flouting the law.

1508
01:44:04,487 --> 01:44:08,446
Come on, Loreen, where does it end? All
these folks suing for profit. What next?

1509
01:44:08,607 --> 01:44:10,563
Have a heart attack, sue McDonald's?

1510
01:44:10,727 --> 01:44:13,685
Sue my grocery store because
you bought some pork chops...

1511
01:44:13,847 --> 01:44:16,407
...now you got clogged arteries.
- You been smoking.

1512
01:44:16,567 --> 01:44:19,525
It is still our right to keep and bear arms.
Remember that.

1513
01:44:19,687 --> 01:44:22,918
Well, Mr. Fitch, are we concluding
our business today or not?

1514
01:44:23,087 --> 01:44:26,443
<i>- Could you hold for just one minute?</i>
- One minute.

1515
01:44:29,647 --> 01:44:33,037
- Doyle, give me something.
- I can't really talk right now, sweetheart.

1516
01:44:33,207 --> 01:44:36,756
I met this nice lady, and she's telling me
all about the neighborhood.

1517
01:44:36,927 --> 01:44:38,883
<i>The jury has the case.</i>

1518
01:44:39,047 --> 01:44:41,436
- There could be a verdict any second.
- <i>I hear you.</i>

1519
01:44:41,607 --> 01:44:44,599
I'll call you back as soon
as I get on the road, okay?

1520
01:44:44,767 --> 01:44:45,961
- Doyle...
- <i>I love you too.</i>

1521
01:44:46,207 --> 01:44:47,686
All right. Bye.

1522
01:44:47,847 --> 01:44:50,042
Word just in.
Rohr's not paying.

1523
01:44:50,207 --> 01:44:52,277
It's yours.

1524
01:44:53,687 --> 01:44:56,076
Marlee, unhappy news, I hear.

1525
01:44:56,247 --> 01:44:58,556
<i>Rohr has taken himself out of the game.</i>

1526
01:44:58,727 --> 01:45:02,322
I thought you might be inclined to
make a reduction in your selling price.

1527
01:45:02,487 --> 01:45:06,366
Look, Rankin, in 30 seconds,
you're still gonna lose. Understand?

1528
01:45:06,527 --> 01:45:09,485
Now, do we have a deal or don't we?

1529
01:45:13,327 --> 01:45:14,601
We have a deal.

1530
01:45:15,127 --> 01:45:17,402
<i>- I'm wiring the money.</i>
- Congratulations.

1531
01:45:17,567 --> 01:45:19,125
<i>You bought yourself a verdict.</i>

1532
01:45:20,327 --> 01:45:22,716
<i>It's not our job to change the law.</i>

1533
01:45:22,887 --> 01:45:27,642
It is our duty to serve it. The law says
this guy Kevin Peltier was responsible...

1534
01:45:27,807 --> 01:45:29,081
...not the gun company.

1535
01:45:29,247 --> 01:45:31,397
Yes, we are meant to serve the law...

1536
01:45:31,567 --> 01:45:34,525
...but the law is also meant
to serve all of the people.

1537
01:45:34,687 --> 01:45:37,201
I'm with you, Frank.
Founding Fathers and all that.

1538
01:46:00,287 --> 01:46:01,720
Ladies and gentlemen, whoa!

1539
01:46:02,207 --> 01:46:06,564
I think a preliminary vote would help us,
if nobody has anything new to say.

1540
01:46:06,727 --> 01:46:09,161
- Let's vote.
- I'd like to say something.

1541
01:46:09,487 --> 01:46:12,718
- Couldn't be easy.
- Hey, Frank, let him speak.

1542
01:46:16,327 --> 01:46:19,205
Well, I hope you like lots of sugar
in your iced tea.

1543
01:46:19,367 --> 01:46:21,801
- Oh, yes, ma'am, I surely do.
- Well, that's good.

1544
01:46:21,967 --> 01:46:24,720
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1545
01:46:25,087 --> 01:46:27,760
Are these your daughters?

1546
01:46:27,927 --> 01:46:30,077
Gabrielle and Margaret.

1547
01:46:30,247 --> 01:46:31,965
They were Irish twins.

1548
01:46:32,327 --> 01:46:34,921
You know, just one grade apart.

1549
01:46:36,727 --> 01:46:38,877
Forgive me.

1550
01:46:39,607 --> 01:46:42,280
It's still hard to talk about.

1551
01:46:42,447 --> 01:46:44,802
I'm sorry?

1552
01:46:45,687 --> 01:46:47,917
Well, it was bad enough
losing Margaret...

1553
01:46:48,087 --> 01:46:51,204
<i>...but</i> it's been so long
since I've spoken to <i>Gabby...</i>

1554
01:46:51,367 --> 01:46:54,598
- <i>...I</i> just feel like I've lost them both.
- Well...

1555
01:46:54,767 --> 01:46:59,204
...what happened?
How did Margaret pass away?

1556
01:46:59,367 --> 01:47:03,246
You're not from around here.
You wouldn't know about the shooting.

1557
01:47:03,407 --> 01:47:06,524
I don't think this case is about guns.
It's about the law.

1558
01:47:06,687 --> 01:47:09,155
And like Frank says,
it's about serving the law.

1559
01:47:09,327 --> 01:47:12,160
Guns are involved,
and I don't know anybody in the <i>world...</i>

1560
01:47:12,327 --> 01:47:15,558
<i>...who</i> doesn't feel strongly about guns
one way or the other.

1561
01:47:15,727 --> 01:47:18,400
- What's wrong, Frank?
- I can guess which way you lean.

1562
01:47:18,567 --> 01:47:19,841
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1563
01:47:20,007 --> 01:47:22,567
You've had an agenda
the whole time you've been here.

1564
01:47:22,727 --> 01:47:25,764
- You're the plaintiff's boy.
- Come on. What are you saying?

1565
01:47:25,927 --> 01:47:27,326
- It's the truth.
- What?

1566
01:47:27,487 --> 01:47:29,159
- Let him speak.
- What's the problem?

1567
01:47:29,327 --> 01:47:32,319
They made a good product.
It worked. Case closed.

1568
01:47:32,487 --> 01:47:34,239
It's more complicated than that.

1569
01:47:37,487 --> 01:47:38,602
A boy, James Pratt...

1570
01:47:40,527 --> 01:47:44,440
...showed up at the high school with
guns that he bought off the street...

1571
01:47:44,607 --> 01:47:46,518
...and he just started firing.

1572
01:47:49,167 --> 01:47:52,876
Yeah, I'm sorry the lady lost her
husband. I am, but that's life.

1573
01:47:53,047 --> 01:47:57,245
I know a lot of other people had bad
times, but they never sued anybody.

1574
01:47:57,407 --> 01:48:00,285
- Like who?
- Like my buddies, lost their arms or legs.

1575
01:48:00,447 --> 01:48:03,086
- Never got a dime.
- They deserved better. You're right!

1576
01:48:03,247 --> 01:48:06,603
You bet I'm right. We're done here,
Easter. Could we vote, please?

1577
01:48:06,767 --> 01:48:08,120
That's not good enough.

1578
01:48:08,287 --> 01:48:09,640
That's not good enough!

1579
01:48:09,807 --> 01:48:12,958
I wanna talk about the law.
I wanna talk about Celeste Wood.

1580
01:48:14,967 --> 01:48:17,925
The school said that something
had happened to Margaret.

1581
01:48:18,087 --> 01:48:19,520
That she had died.

1582
01:48:22,087 --> 01:48:25,762
- She doesn't deserve that money.
- She deserves a few hours of our time.

1583
01:48:25,927 --> 01:48:27,599
- Can we vote, please?
- Yes.

1584
01:48:27,767 --> 01:48:30,076
- Tell me why.
- I wanna vote. Anybody else?

1585
01:48:30,247 --> 01:48:32,556
- Tell me why.
- I wanna vote. Does anyone else?

1586
01:48:32,727 --> 01:48:34,126
- Let's vote.
- How's it work?

1587
01:48:34,287 --> 01:48:36,164
- Pipe down, Easter.
- Tell me why.

1588
01:48:36,327 --> 01:48:38,522
We all got problems here,
don't we? All of us.

1589
01:48:38,687 --> 01:48:40,723
- We don't get paid for it.
- She's suffered!

1590
01:48:40,887 --> 01:48:44,516
I suffered. I worked my ass off 12 years
at crummy jobs for shit pay.

1591
01:48:44,687 --> 01:48:47,963
- I have never asked for a handout.
- She's not asking for a handout.

1592
01:48:48,127 --> 01:48:49,560
That is bullshit.

1593
01:48:49,967 --> 01:48:54,404
She was with Jeff, Gabby's boyfriend.
He told me that my girl...

1594
01:48:54,567 --> 01:48:57,639
...she froze. She just stood there.

1595
01:48:58,767 --> 01:49:00,564
It took seconds.

1596
01:49:00,727 --> 01:49:06,324
Jeff just kept saying, "I couldn't
reach her. I couldn't pull her down."

1597
01:49:10,927 --> 01:49:14,442
He always thought there was something
that he could've done.

1598
01:49:16,567 --> 01:49:20,355
What are we gonna tell Celeste?
"Life isn't fair"? Write it on a postcard?

1599
01:49:20,527 --> 01:49:22,916
- Is that the best we've got?
- I tell you what else.

1600
01:49:23,087 --> 01:49:25,760
That lawyer can show me
all the home movies he wants...

1601
01:49:25,927 --> 01:49:29,158
...I deserve a lot more for what
I've been through than that woman!

1602
01:49:29,327 --> 01:49:30,919
- Forget her!
- What about the law?

1603
01:49:31,087 --> 01:49:32,361
Fuck the law!

1604
01:49:32,527 --> 01:49:37,157
I don't care if the gun company gave him
an M-16 with a morning doughnut...

1605
01:49:37,327 --> 01:49:40,125
<i>...I'm</i> not giving her a cent.

1606
01:49:42,927 --> 01:49:44,645
That's bullshit, Frank.

1607
01:49:45,087 --> 01:49:46,361
Bullshit.

1608
01:49:47,207 --> 01:49:49,402
Who's with Frank?

1609
01:49:51,407 --> 01:49:55,446
Yes, I'd like to report a robbery in
progress at Mardi Gras Costumes.

1610
01:49:55,607 --> 01:49:58,280
6510 Charter Street.

1611
01:49:59,967 --> 01:50:03,755
Maybe some of you are afraid
or intimidated.

1612
01:50:03,927 --> 01:50:06,361
Maybe some of you
are just out for yourselves.

1613
01:50:09,087 --> 01:50:10,520
Frank is right about me.

1614
01:50:11,807 --> 01:50:13,957
I'm the worst offender here.

1615
01:50:14,127 --> 01:50:18,279
I made up my mind about this case
before I stepped through that door.

1616
01:50:19,727 --> 01:50:21,558
But this trial's not about me.

1617
01:50:21,727 --> 01:50:26,642
And it's not about you. Now, we owe it
to Celeste Wood to sit in this room...

1618
01:50:26,807 --> 01:50:32,404
...and deliberate the facts of the case
for as long as it takes.

1619
01:50:35,367 --> 01:50:37,927
If you don't mind,
there's testimony I'd like to review.

1620
01:50:40,687 --> 01:50:42,359
Mr. Fitch.

1621
01:50:43,367 --> 01:50:45,085
- <i>Yeah?</i>
- Don't wire the money!

1622
01:50:45,247 --> 01:50:47,522
What? What's going on?
Where are you?

1623
01:50:47,687 --> 01:50:51,646
I'm in Gardner. Gardner, Indiana.
It's a setup.

1624
01:50:52,207 --> 01:50:53,481
Gardner.

1625
01:50:56,767 --> 01:51:00,203
- <i>Take the front! Get it open!</i>
- Oh, shit. We got company.

1626
01:51:00,367 --> 01:51:03,643
Take the network down now.
Okay, people, pack it up, tear it down.

1627
01:51:03,807 --> 01:51:08,244
Now! This is not a test. Clear your
drives. Wipe the screens. Let's go.

1628
01:51:08,407 --> 01:51:11,524
Box all photos and files.
No monitors. Leave the monitors.

1629
01:51:11,687 --> 01:51:13,086
Code four, people.

1630
01:51:13,247 --> 01:51:14,965
- Mr. Fitch.
- Thirty seconds!

1631
01:51:15,127 --> 01:51:16,765
We really need to go, sir.

1632
01:51:18,647 --> 01:51:19,921
Twenty seconds!

1633
01:51:20,087 --> 01:51:23,443
- Lamb, what happened in Gardner?
- 1989, <i>Gardner v. Blackwell Arms.</i>

1634
01:51:23,607 --> 01:51:27,316
Town sued the gun manufacturer.
Town lost. Town went bankrupt.

1635
01:51:27,487 --> 01:51:31,685
Fitch worked the case. You got it?
Fitch worked the case.

1636
01:51:40,847 --> 01:51:43,919
- Plan to hear the jury's decision.

1637
01:52:01,247 --> 01:52:04,523
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
have you reached a verdict?

1638
01:52:09,287 --> 01:52:11,960
- We have, Your Honor.
- Hand it to the bailiff, please.

1639
01:52:16,927 --> 01:52:19,122
Thank you, bailiff.

1640
01:52:28,687 --> 01:52:32,362
In the matter of <i>Celeste Wood</i>
<i>v. Vicksburg Firearms...</i>

1641
01:52:32,527 --> 01:52:35,997
...the jury finds for the plaintiff,
Celeste Wood.

1642
01:52:36,167 --> 01:52:39,284
They award special damages
in the amount of $ 1 million...

1643
01:52:39,447 --> 01:52:43,042
...and general damages
in the amount of $ 110 million.

1644
01:52:44,207 --> 01:52:46,880
May I remind you
this court is still in session.

1645
01:52:47,087 --> 01:52:50,716
- The court is in session. Order. Order.
- That's bullshit!

1646
01:52:50,887 --> 01:52:53,321
That's enough. Court's adjourned.

1647
01:53:28,447 --> 01:53:30,403
<i>When Judge Harkin read this verdict...</i>

1648
01:53:30,567 --> 01:53:33,445
...a spontaneous round of applause
from the courtroom.

1649
01:53:33,607 --> 01:53:38,123
Support for the teary-eyed widow who
waged war on the entire gun industry.

1650
01:53:38,287 --> 01:53:40,517
No doubt a surprise...

1651
01:53:45,847 --> 01:53:48,759
No matter what the anti-gun lobbyists
say or the NRA says...

1652
01:53:48,927 --> 01:53:53,876
...on this day, in this courtroom,
the final word was given by the jury.

1653
01:53:54,047 --> 01:53:57,756
<i>There have been other lawsuits filed</i>
<i>against gun manufacturers in the past...</i>

1654
01:53:57,927 --> 01:54:02,284
<i>... and juries have traditionally sided</i>
<i>with the gun industry, until today.</i>

1655
01:54:02,447 --> 01:54:06,838
<i>The $ 110 million award, which the jury</i>
<i>handed Celeste Wood today...</i>

1656
01:54:07,007 --> 01:54:08,565
<i>... could cripple the gun industry.</i>

1657
01:54:09,327 --> 01:54:13,161
<i>And to say it's been an uphill battle</i>
<i>for Mr. Rohr is an understatement.</i>

1658
01:54:13,327 --> 01:54:16,603
<i>In fact, you might say it's been</i>
<i>a David and Goliath battle.</i>

1659
01:54:16,767 --> 01:54:20,999
<i>But today in New Orleans,</i>
<i>one gun-industry giant has fallen.</i>

1660
01:54:21,167 --> 01:54:23,362
<i>The 12 people who sat on that jury...</i>

1661
01:54:25,367 --> 01:54:26,959
Ten years, Fitch.

1662
01:54:34,487 --> 01:54:38,002
They're gonna appeal. The gun company.
You know that, right?

1663
01:54:38,167 --> 01:54:40,317
Of course.

1664
01:54:40,487 --> 01:54:42,000
But not with you.

1665
01:54:43,087 --> 01:54:47,365
You show up on another case, any case,
even a contested parking ticket...

1666
01:54:47,527 --> 01:54:48,801
...this goes to the IRS.

1667
01:54:50,167 --> 01:54:53,398
And the Justice Department,
Federal Board of Judicial Review.

1668
01:54:53,807 --> 01:54:57,356
You're out. Retired as of today.

1669
01:54:58,967 --> 01:55:01,322
Gardner, Indiana.

1670
01:55:03,727 --> 01:55:05,126
School shooting.

1671
01:55:05,327 --> 01:55:08,603
- He remembers.
- Blackwell Arms.

1672
01:55:10,447 --> 01:55:13,996
The town really thought
they had that one, didn't they?

1673
01:55:14,167 --> 01:55:16,158
We did have it.

1674
01:55:16,567 --> 01:55:18,319
Now what?

1675
01:55:18,487 --> 01:55:21,001
What on earth are you gonna do
with all that money?

1676
01:55:21,167 --> 01:55:25,399
- $ 15 million, that changes people.
- Yeah, well, that's what we're hoping.

1677
01:55:25,567 --> 01:55:29,196
See, back home, the victims' families
could really use that money.

1678
01:55:29,367 --> 01:55:30,846
Goodbye, Fitch.

1679
01:55:31,007 --> 01:55:36,001
Well, wait. How did you swing them?
How'd you swing them your way?

1680
01:55:36,167 --> 01:55:39,284
I hear you got 10 votes.
How'd you do that?

1681
01:55:39,447 --> 01:55:42,962
I didn't swing anybody. I just
stopped you from stealing the thing.

1682
01:55:45,687 --> 01:55:47,678
We let them vote their hearts.

1683
01:55:47,847 --> 01:55:49,997
That means you lose.
Enjoy your drink.

1684
01:55:50,767 --> 01:55:53,600
What are you...? You think you can
just walk away from this?

1685
01:55:53,767 --> 01:55:56,440
And I'm betting that the two of you,
you can't stop.

1686
01:55:56,727 --> 01:55:59,844
Because if you did,
what would you have?

1687
01:56:00,007 --> 01:56:01,645
Nothing!

1688
01:56:02,447 --> 01:56:04,165
Nothing!

1689
01:56:48,527 --> 01:56:49,801
- We're having lunch.
- Why?

1690
01:56:49,967 --> 01:56:52,037
We're celebrating, that's why.

1691
01:56:52,967 --> 01:56:56,118
Do you know why we're celebrating?
We are very happy today.

1692
01:56:56,287 --> 01:56:59,484
Go inside, get me an order of corn bread.
Get them that table.

1693
01:56:59,647 --> 01:57:01,956
- I'm just gonna be one minute.
- You got it.

1694
01:57:33,967 --> 01:57:35,605
I wanna go home.

1695
01:57:39,327 --> 01:57:40,840
Okay.

1696
01:57:41,407 --> 01:57:43,045
Let's go.

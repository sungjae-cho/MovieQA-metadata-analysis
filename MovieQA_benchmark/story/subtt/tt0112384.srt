1
00:00:44,464 --> 00:00:47,713
We have the crew crossing gantry
for capsule ingress.

2
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:49,460
Roger that.

3
00:00:49,552 --> 00:00:52,007
Inspired by the late President Kennedy,

4
00:00:52,054 --> 00:00:57,013
in only seven years, America has risen
to the challenge of what he called...

5
00:00:57,060 --> 00:01:00,891
"the most hazardous and dangerous
and greatest adventure...

6
00:01:00,979 --> 00:01:03,353
on which man has ever embarked."

7
00:01:03,441 --> 00:01:07,687
After trailing the Russians for years
with our manned space program,

8
00:01:07,779 --> 00:01:11,528
- We got a short!
- And after that sudden, horrible fire...

9
00:01:11,617 --> 00:01:13,691
on the launchpad
during a routine test...

10
00:01:13,784 --> 00:01:16,535
- that killed astronauts Gus Grissom...
- Fire in the cockpit!

11
00:01:16,621 --> 00:01:18,697
- Ed White and Roger Chaffee...
- Get us outta here!

12
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:23,119
There were serious doubts that we
could beat the Russians to the moon.

13
00:01:23,211 --> 00:01:26,462
But tonight, a mere 18 months
after the tragedy of Apollo 1...

14
00:01:26,548 --> 00:01:30,710
the entire world watched in awe
as Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin...

15
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,753
landed on the moon.

16
00:01:32,845 --> 00:01:35,052
The big news came
just a moment ago.

17
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:38,011
Mission Control gave
the spacecraft permission...

18
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:41,060
to go for
the extravehicular activity...

19
00:01:41,103 --> 00:01:43,061
that is, for the walk
on the moon...

20
00:01:43,147 --> 00:01:47,892
far earlier than anticipated,
9:00 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time.

21
00:01:47,944 --> 00:01:51,859
Important thing when you're penetrating
the lunar module is your attitude...

22
00:01:51,907 --> 00:01:53,864
and your relative speed.

23
00:01:53,908 --> 00:01:56,909
Let's say this is me in the command
module and this is you...

24
00:01:56,994 --> 00:01:58,904
- All right.
- In the LEM.

25
00:01:58,997 --> 00:02:00,741
This thing sticks out.
That's called a probe.

26
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:02,742
- Is that true?
- Absolutely.

27
00:02:02,834 --> 00:02:07,828
Tracey, when you feel that thing
slide in, everything's clickin'...

28
00:02:07,923 --> 00:02:10,080
it's like no other
feeling in the world.

29
00:02:11,676 --> 00:02:14,594
- A little liquid propulsion.
- What's the big occasion?

30
00:02:14,638 --> 00:02:16,631
How's it goin' at Mission Control?

31
00:02:16,723 --> 00:02:19,393
It's a nervous time. They're pacin'
around, smokin' like chimneys.

32
00:02:19,434 --> 00:02:21,841
Gene Kranz is gonna have puppies.
Jim Lovell.

33
00:02:21,936 --> 00:02:23,680
- Hi.
- This is Tracey.

34
00:02:23,772 --> 00:02:25,681
- How do ya do, Tracey?
- This is the man.

35
00:02:25,774 --> 00:02:29,274
Gemini 7. Gemini 12. Apollo 8.
They were the first around the moon.

36
00:02:29,361 --> 00:02:30,772
This guy did ten laps.

37
00:02:30,863 --> 00:02:33,271
With one hand on the wheel.
Make yourselves at home.

38
00:02:33,365 --> 00:02:35,273
- Hey, Marilyn.
- Where have you been?

39
00:02:35,367 --> 00:02:37,655
This is the last champagne
in Houston.

40
00:02:37,744 --> 00:02:39,654
- Very good. Very good.
- Everything else all right?

41
00:02:39,746 --> 00:02:42,451
- Everything's on course.
- Looks okay. Hey! Cadet Lovell.

42
00:02:42,541 --> 00:02:45,458
- Hey, Dad.
- Put this on ice. Make sure it's cold.

43
00:02:45,544 --> 00:02:48,461
- You gonna get a haircut this week?
- I'm on vacation.

44
00:02:48,547 --> 00:02:51,298
Oh, get a haircut.

45
00:02:57,348 --> 00:02:59,886
Well, hello there.

46
00:02:59,975 --> 00:03:03,641
- I wouldn't mind bein' up there tonight.
- God, who wouldn't.

47
00:03:03,729 --> 00:03:06,646
Don't worry. Our day's comin'.

48
00:03:06,691 --> 00:03:09,691
They're not gonna cut
the program before number 14.

49
00:03:09,777 --> 00:03:12,066
- You know, my cousin called.
- Uh-huh.

50
00:03:12,155 --> 00:03:14,479
Asked who we bribed
to get on Jim Lovell's crew.

51
00:03:14,573 --> 00:03:15,818
Yeah.

52
00:03:15,866 --> 00:03:19,318
I told him they wanted
to make sure he got the best.

53
00:03:19,495 --> 00:03:21,654
Well, they got that right.

54
00:03:21,747 --> 00:03:26,077
- What network do we want?
- Come on! Walt! Hey! Put on Walter!

55
00:03:26,127 --> 00:03:28,084
- Walter!
- Jules Bergman!

56
00:03:28,129 --> 00:03:29,587
John, turn it up!

57
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:32,998
...has completed putting on
the spacesuits and the boots.

58
00:03:33,092 --> 00:03:38,087
I, uh... I really appreciate you all
coming to this dress rehearsal party...

59
00:03:38,181 --> 00:03:41,347
for my Apollo 12 landing.

60
00:03:41,433 --> 00:03:42,844
Sit down, Conrad.

61
00:03:42,934 --> 00:03:45,391
I think we should all take
a moment to recognize...

62
00:03:45,437 --> 00:03:49,305
the exemplary...
hell, damn near heroic...

63
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:54,607
effort displayed by Neil Armstrong's
backup for this historic moon walk...

64
00:03:54,655 --> 00:03:56,944
and, of course, his crew.

65
00:03:56,991 --> 00:03:59,946
Let's hear it for Jim Lovell,
Ken Mattingly and Fred Haise.

66
00:04:04,499 --> 00:04:08,448
There he is! There he is!
Everybody quiet down!

67
00:04:08,545 --> 00:04:10,620
Hey! Kids!

68
00:04:10,714 --> 00:04:13,464
We had a good touchdown.

69
00:04:13,549 --> 00:04:18,889
We can verify the position of the
opening I ought to have on the camera.

70
00:04:18,972 --> 00:04:22,174
What?

71
00:04:22,266 --> 00:04:26,430
- Think it's too late for him to abort?
- He still has time to get out.

72
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:29,184
He just needs somebody to wave him off.
Pull up, Neil!

73
00:04:29,273 --> 00:04:32,478
Pull up! Pull up!

74
00:04:32,569 --> 00:04:36,816
Okay, Neil, we can see you
coming down the ladder now.

75
00:04:36,864 --> 00:04:38,940
Look at those pictures. Wow.

76
00:04:38,992 --> 00:04:41,743
I'm, uh, at the foot of the ladder.

77
00:04:41,829 --> 00:04:46,537
The LEM footpads are only depressed
in the surface about, uh...

78
00:04:46,625 --> 00:04:48,664
one or two inches.

79
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:51,995
- It's almost like a powder.
- Armstrong is on the moon.

80
00:04:52,088 --> 00:04:55,624
Neil Armstrong,
38-year-old American...

81
00:04:55,676 --> 00:04:58,511
standing on the surface
of the moon...

82
00:04:59,888 --> 00:05:03,138
on this July 20, 1969.

83
00:05:03,182 --> 00:05:06,053
That's one small step for man...

84
00:05:07,604 --> 00:05:11,685
one giant leap for mankind.

85
00:05:11,776 --> 00:05:13,733
His quote was...

86
00:05:13,819 --> 00:05:19,573
"That's one small step for man,
one giant leap for mankind."

87
00:05:26,206 --> 00:05:28,958
Somewhere

88
00:05:29,042 --> 00:05:31,119
Beyond the sea

89
00:05:31,211 --> 00:05:33,287
Somewhere waitin' for me

90
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:35,954
- You're drunk, Lovell.
- Yeah.

91
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:38,173
I'm not used to the champagne.

92
00:05:38,219 --> 00:05:40,176
Me neither.

93
00:05:42,972 --> 00:05:46,140
I can't deal with cleaning up.
Let's sell the house.

94
00:05:46,226 --> 00:05:48,717
All right, let's sell the house.

95
00:05:49,896 --> 00:05:53,266
They're back inside now
lookin' up at us.

96
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,481
Isn't that somethin'?

97
00:05:55,569 --> 00:05:59,947
I bet Jannie Armstrong doesn't
get a wink of sleep tonight.

98
00:06:00,033 --> 00:06:03,900
When you were on the far side on 8,
I didn't sleep at all.

99
00:06:03,953 --> 00:06:06,623
I just vacuumed
over and over again.

100
00:06:06,706 --> 00:06:11,913
Christopher Columbus,
Charles Lindbergh and Neil Armstrong.

101
00:06:13,296 --> 00:06:16,213
Neil Armstrong.

102
00:06:26,017 --> 00:06:30,762
From now on, we live in a world
where man has walked on the moon.

103
00:06:32,524 --> 00:06:34,812
It's not a miracle.

104
00:06:35,985 --> 00:06:38,523
We just decided to go.

105
00:06:38,612 --> 00:06:42,064
On Apollo 8, we were so close...

106
00:06:42,117 --> 00:06:45,486
just 60 nautical miles down and...

107
00:06:48,165 --> 00:06:50,785
It was like I could just...

108
00:06:50,875 --> 00:06:54,576
step out and walk
on the face of it.

109
00:06:59,509 --> 00:07:01,965
I want to go back there.

110
00:07:07,976 --> 00:07:09,968
Where's my mountain?

111
00:07:10,019 --> 00:07:13,638
Well, it... Up there.

112
00:07:13,691 --> 00:07:15,978
It's, uh, right up by the...

113
00:07:16,068 --> 00:07:18,772
It's... Okay, do you see
where the shadow crosses...

114
00:07:18,819 --> 00:07:21,311
the white area there?

115
00:07:21,406 --> 00:07:23,031
That's the Sea of Tranquility...

116
00:07:23,117 --> 00:07:25,488
and your mountain's right there
on the edge of that.

117
00:07:25,535 --> 00:07:28,241
It's your mountain.
Your mountain, Marilyn. Mount Marilyn.

118
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:30,951
I don't see it.

119
00:07:33,168 --> 00:07:35,741
Well, you gotta look harder.

120
00:07:38,257 --> 00:07:40,748
You... You... You look harder...

121
00:07:42,426 --> 00:07:45,097
- Jim.
- While I...

122
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:47,089
Jim!

123
00:07:47,182 --> 00:07:49,423
Groovin'

124
00:07:49,518 --> 00:07:52,768
Down a crowded avenue

125
00:07:55,024 --> 00:07:58,023
The astronaut is only
the most visible member...

126
00:07:58,068 --> 00:08:02,814
of a very large team, and all of us
down to the guy sweeping the floor...

127
00:08:02,865 --> 00:08:04,822
are honored to be a part of it.

128
00:08:04,867 --> 00:08:08,200
What did the man say? "Give me a lever
long enough and I'll move the world"?

129
00:08:08,286 --> 00:08:11,620
That's what we're doing here.
This is divine inspiration.

130
00:08:11,707 --> 00:08:16,618
It's the best part of each one of us,
the belief that anything is possible.

131
00:08:16,713 --> 00:08:20,211
Things like a computer
that can fit into a single room...

132
00:08:20,299 --> 00:08:24,082
and hold millions of pieces
of information...

133
00:08:24,177 --> 00:08:26,847
or the Saturn 5 rocket.

134
00:08:26,889 --> 00:08:29,889
This is the actual launch vehicle
that will be taking Alan Shepard...

135
00:08:29,975 --> 00:08:34,223
and his crew on the first leg
of the Apollo 13 mission.

136
00:08:34,272 --> 00:08:37,225
When are you
going up again, Jim?

137
00:08:37,315 --> 00:08:41,315
I'm slated to be the commander
of Apollo 14 sometime late next year.

138
00:08:42,488 --> 00:08:44,612
If there is an Apollo 14.

139
00:08:44,657 --> 00:08:50,410
Jim, people in my state have been
asking why we're continuing...

140
00:08:50,496 --> 00:08:54,328
to fund this program now that we've
beaten the Russians to the moon.

141
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:57,786
Imagine if Christopher Columbus
had come back from the new world...

142
00:08:57,879 --> 00:09:00,334
and no one returned
in his footsteps.

143
00:09:00,423 --> 00:09:04,123
Attention, all personnel.
Clear level three.

144
00:09:04,217 --> 00:09:06,295
Are there any other questions?

145
00:09:07,472 --> 00:09:09,678
How do you go
to the bathroom in space?

146
00:09:09,765 --> 00:09:12,970
Well, I tell you,
it's a highly technical process...

147
00:09:13,061 --> 00:09:17,390
of cranking down the window and
looking for a gas station, which, uh...

148
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,559
Oh, there's Deke Slayton.

149
00:09:20,609 --> 00:09:23,611
Deke, you might be able
to answer this lady's question.

150
00:09:23,696 --> 00:09:27,528
Deke is one of the original Mercury
seven astronauts, ladies and gentlemen.

151
00:09:27,617 --> 00:09:30,951
Now he's our boss. He hands out
the astronauts' flight assignments...

152
00:09:30,995 --> 00:09:34,032
so naturally we kick back
part of our salaries to Deke.

153
00:09:34,123 --> 00:09:37,540
- How much this month?
- Can I have a minute?
Something's come up.

154
00:09:37,628 --> 00:09:39,537
Sure, you b... Uh, Henry?

155
00:09:41,089 --> 00:09:42,997
Hey!

156
00:09:46,677 --> 00:09:50,462
- Anybody home?
- I'm not being a cheerleader, Mom!

157
00:09:50,515 --> 00:09:52,591
You don't understand!
I worked so hard on this!

158
00:09:52,642 --> 00:09:54,101
Maybe I don't understand...

159
00:09:54,144 --> 00:09:57,476
but you are not wearing that
out in this neighborhood.

160
00:09:57,521 --> 00:09:59,894
She's not even wearing a bra!
You can see everything!

161
00:09:59,982 --> 00:10:01,394
Shut up!

162
00:10:01,485 --> 00:10:03,976
- Everybody. Marilyn, trick or treat.
- Jim.

163
00:10:04,029 --> 00:10:07,896
You know that Easter vacation trip
we had planned for Acapulco?

164
00:10:07,991 --> 00:10:09,402
Uh-oh.

165
00:10:09,494 --> 00:10:12,410
I was thinkin' there might be
a slight change in destination.

166
00:10:12,495 --> 00:10:14,950
Really?

167
00:10:14,997 --> 00:10:18,119
Maybe, say... the moon.

168
00:10:20,629 --> 00:10:23,582
Al Shepard's ear infection
has flared up...

169
00:10:23,673 --> 00:10:27,837
and we've all been bumped up
to the prime crew of Apollo 13.

170
00:10:27,928 --> 00:10:32,174
Straight to the head of the line
and the Fra Mauro highlands.

171
00:10:32,224 --> 00:10:34,977
Six months?
You're moving up six months?

172
00:10:35,019 --> 00:10:38,517
- Dad, can I please wear this?
- Sure.

173
00:10:38,605 --> 00:10:40,977
- Jim.
- No! No. Absolutely not.

174
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:43,895
- Don't you want somebody to love
- This stinks!

175
00:10:43,986 --> 00:10:46,311
They're not rushing things, are they?

176
00:10:46,364 --> 00:10:48,356
You're gonna be ready
in six months?

177
00:10:48,407 --> 00:10:52,487
We'll be ready. Boy, I wouldn't want
to be around Al Shepard tonight.

178
00:10:52,536 --> 00:10:55,205
I gotta get over there.
We're gonna have to get up to speed.

179
00:10:55,289 --> 00:10:57,116
Go. Go.

180
00:10:57,208 --> 00:10:59,450
I'm gonna walk
on the moon, Marilyn.

181
00:10:59,543 --> 00:11:02,829
I know. I can't believe it.

182
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:06,379
Naturally, it's 13.
Why 13?

183
00:11:06,425 --> 00:11:08,501
It comes after 12, hon.

184
00:11:10,345 --> 00:11:12,718
Apollo 13, you are go for docking.

185
00:11:15,769 --> 00:11:19,765
All systems are nominal
and on the line.

186
00:11:19,854 --> 00:11:23,687
Okay, S-4B is stable,
slot panels are drifting free.

187
00:11:23,734 --> 00:11:28,278
The drogue is clear.
The docking target is clear.

188
00:11:28,364 --> 00:11:32,362
Okay, I'm comin' up on that now.
Two... one... mark.

189
00:11:32,410 --> 00:11:35,576
Seventy-five feet.
We're comin' up on docking.

190
00:11:35,662 --> 00:11:39,661
Let's shut down some thrusters on 'em.
We'll see what he does.

191
00:11:40,794 --> 00:11:43,000
Whoa. Wait a minute.

192
00:11:43,087 --> 00:11:45,328
I lost something here.
I can't translate up.

193
00:11:45,423 --> 00:11:48,757
Houston, we are drifting
down and away.

194
00:11:48,843 --> 00:11:51,760
- Wanna back off and take another run?
- No, I got it.

195
00:11:51,846 --> 00:11:54,883
Let me just try
and get it stable here.

196
00:11:54,933 --> 00:11:59,559
- I'm gonna reset the high gain.
- Got the target back in the reticle.

197
00:11:59,603 --> 00:12:01,929
We're stable.
Go ahead and recycle the valves.

198
00:12:02,024 --> 00:12:05,108
- Forty feet.
- They're all gray.

199
00:12:07,987 --> 00:12:10,443
Twenty.

200
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:13,360
- Easy.
- Ten feet.

201
00:12:16,871 --> 00:12:19,363
- Capture.
- That's it!

202
00:12:19,457 --> 00:12:23,123
- That's it.
- Sweet move, Ken. Beautiful.

203
00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:26,620
- Gentlemen, that is the way we do that.
- Man, that woke me up.

204
00:12:26,672 --> 00:12:31,548
Apollo 13 backup crew,
you're up in the simulator.

205
00:12:31,636 --> 00:12:34,887
- Nice job, gentlemen.
- That's three hours of boredom...

206
00:12:34,973 --> 00:12:37,049
followed by seven seconds
of sheer terror.

207
00:12:37,141 --> 00:12:40,593
Good job, guys.
You just won the Christmas turkey.

208
00:12:40,645 --> 00:12:44,974
Nice try, Frank.
You really outfoxed 'em, brother.

209
00:12:45,067 --> 00:12:47,937
Yeah, but it wasn't perfect.
Used up too much fuel.

210
00:12:47,986 --> 00:12:49,944
You're above the curve.

211
00:12:49,989 --> 00:12:53,653
Not by much. Listen, guys,
I wanna work it again.

212
00:12:53,742 --> 00:12:58,784
Hey, we gotta be up with the dawn patrol
headed for Bethpage, what, 0700?

213
00:12:58,830 --> 00:13:00,787
- Wheels up at 0700.
- Yeah, I know...

214
00:13:00,833 --> 00:13:03,537
but my rate of turn
is still a little slow.

215
00:13:03,627 --> 00:13:06,331
I really think
we should work it again.

216
00:13:06,422 --> 00:13:11,498
- Well, let's get it right.
- Okay, set it up again, Frank.

217
00:13:11,593 --> 00:13:14,679
Okay, 13 backup crew.
It'll have to wait.

218
00:13:14,764 --> 00:13:18,677
- Prime crew's up for another run.
- Yeah, baby.

219
00:13:19,017 --> 00:13:22,185
Apollo 13, we show S-4B shutdown...

220
00:13:22,271 --> 00:13:24,263
and all systems are nominal.

221
00:13:24,356 --> 00:13:26,645
Fred, set the S-band omni to B...

222
00:13:26,692 --> 00:13:29,444
and when you get
in the LEM, two forward.

223
00:13:29,528 --> 00:13:33,277
Good shape over here.

224
00:13:33,365 --> 00:13:37,861
Hey, we got a problem.

225
00:13:37,912 --> 00:13:41,779
- Ken, get your helmet on!
- I can't get it locked!

226
00:13:45,711 --> 00:13:47,787
Oh, God!

227
00:13:59,391 --> 00:14:01,134
Jim!

228
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:20,079
I thought the stars
would fall down on you.

229
00:14:20,122 --> 00:14:23,324
That's silly.
Stars can't fall on us.

230
00:14:23,416 --> 00:14:25,324
You're a smarter kid than I was.

231
00:14:25,417 --> 00:14:28,039
How long will it take
to get to the moon?

232
00:14:28,087 --> 00:14:33,757
Four days.
But that's pretty fast.

233
00:14:33,801 --> 00:14:36,127
See, this is
the Saturn 4B booster...

234
00:14:36,221 --> 00:14:39,257
and it shoots us
away from the Earth...

235
00:14:39,348 --> 00:14:43,394
as fast as a bullet from a gun...

236
00:14:43,437 --> 00:14:48,014
until the moon's gravity
actually grabs us and pulls us...

237
00:14:48,108 --> 00:14:52,401
into a circle around the moon...

238
00:14:52,445 --> 00:14:54,438
which is called an orbit.

239
00:14:54,530 --> 00:14:56,606
All right?

240
00:14:56,699 --> 00:14:59,321
Fred and I float down the tunnel
into the lunar module...

241
00:14:59,411 --> 00:15:01,320
this spidery-Iookin' guy.

242
00:15:01,413 --> 00:15:05,409
Only holds two people,
and it's just for landin' on the moon.

243
00:15:05,457 --> 00:15:08,459
And I take the controls
and I steer it around...

244
00:15:08,503 --> 00:15:10,626
and I fly it down...

245
00:15:10,672 --> 00:15:14,373
adjustin' it here,
the attitude there, pitch, roll...

246
00:15:14,468 --> 00:15:18,215
for a nice, soft landing
on the moon.

247
00:15:18,304 --> 00:15:21,720
Better than Neil Armstrong.
Way better than Pete Conrad.

248
00:15:24,478 --> 00:15:29,898
Dad... did you know
the astronauts in the fire?

249
00:15:32,527 --> 00:15:36,608
Yeah. Yeah, I did. I knew the
astronauts in the fire. All of 'em.

250
00:15:39,702 --> 00:15:41,908
Could that happen again?

251
00:15:43,330 --> 00:15:45,654
Well, I'll tell ya
somethin' about that fire.

252
00:15:45,706 --> 00:15:49,076
Um, a lot of things went wrong.

253
00:15:50,337 --> 00:15:53,670
The, uh... The door.

254
00:15:53,715 --> 00:15:58,294
It's called the hatch. They couldn't
get it open when they needed to get out.

255
00:15:58,345 --> 00:16:01,511
That was one thing. And, uh...

256
00:16:01,555 --> 00:16:05,091
Well, a lot of things
went wrong in that fire.

257
00:16:07,188 --> 00:16:09,346
Did they fix it?

258
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:12,855
Oh, yes. Absolutely.
We fixed it.

259
00:16:12,901 --> 00:16:15,107
It's not a problem anymore.

260
00:16:26,039 --> 00:16:29,539
I can't believe they still
have you doing public appearances.

261
00:16:29,627 --> 00:16:33,624
Well, Henry Hurt was... all over me.

262
00:16:33,713 --> 00:16:36,502
I know. But with a training
schedule this tight...

263
00:16:36,551 --> 00:16:40,049
Well, it's... It's the program, Marilyn.
You know, it's NASA.

264
00:16:40,137 --> 00:16:42,807
Hey! Hey, you're
Jim Lovell, aren't ya?

265
00:16:42,891 --> 00:16:45,215
Hey! Lucky 13!

266
00:16:45,267 --> 00:16:47,344
Right on!

267
00:16:55,444 --> 00:16:57,483
That's the second time
it's done that.

268
00:17:07,081 --> 00:17:09,537
I was looking at the kids'
school schedule coming up.

269
00:17:09,584 --> 00:17:11,043
Yeah?

270
00:17:11,086 --> 00:17:14,453
- It's a very busy week.
- Yeah.

271
00:17:14,547 --> 00:17:18,295
I'm thinking about
not going to the launch.

272
00:17:21,303 --> 00:17:23,261
Huh.

273
00:17:23,348 --> 00:17:25,921
The kids need me at home, honey.

274
00:17:26,017 --> 00:17:30,062
Marilyn, we've had
these kids for awhile now.

275
00:17:30,104 --> 00:17:33,105
They've never kept you from
comin' to the other launches.

276
00:17:33,149 --> 00:17:35,474
But now we have your mother.
She's just had this stroke.

277
00:17:35,568 --> 00:17:36,979
Mom's fine.

278
00:17:37,069 --> 00:17:39,643
It's not like I've
never been to a launch.

279
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:42,147
The other wives
have not done three.

280
00:17:42,242 --> 00:17:45,989
I just don't think
I can go through all that.

281
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,917
I'll just be glad
when this one's over.

282
00:17:55,046 --> 00:17:59,294
Well, you're gonna miss
a hell of a show.

283
00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:09,305
- Jim.
- Hey, guys. See ya in a few weeks.

284
00:18:09,394 --> 00:18:12,597
Take care.
Bring us back a moon rock.

285
00:18:37,757 --> 00:18:40,958
So the number 13
doesn't bother you.

286
00:18:41,009 --> 00:18:43,001
Only if it's a Friday, Phil.

287
00:18:43,094 --> 00:18:47,473
Apollo 13, lifting off
at 1300 hours and 13 minutes...

288
00:18:47,517 --> 00:18:50,849
and entering the moon's
gravity on April 13?

289
00:18:50,936 --> 00:18:54,851
Uh, Ken Mattingly here has been
doing some scientific experiments...

290
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:56,849
regarding that very phenomenon,
haven't you?

291
00:18:56,942 --> 00:19:01,984
Uh, yes. Well, I had a black cat,
uh, walk over a broken mirror...

292
00:19:02,031 --> 00:19:03,904
under the lunar module ladder.

293
00:19:03,992 --> 00:19:05,698
It didn't seem to be a problem.

294
00:19:05,742 --> 00:19:08,068
We're considering a letter
we got from a fella...

295
00:19:08,162 --> 00:19:12,112
who said we oughta take
a pig with us for good luck.

296
00:19:12,207 --> 00:19:15,208
Does it bother you that the public
regards this flight as routine?

297
00:19:15,293 --> 00:19:19,207
There's nothing routine about flying
to the moon. I can vouch for that.

298
00:19:19,298 --> 00:19:24,044
And, uh, I think that
an astronaut's last mission...

299
00:19:24,095 --> 00:19:29,089
his final flight... that's always
going to be very special.

300
00:19:29,183 --> 00:19:31,472
Why is this your last, Jim?

301
00:19:31,561 --> 00:19:35,308
I'm in command
of the best ship...

302
00:19:35,398 --> 00:19:38,399
with the best crew
that anybody could ask for...

303
00:19:38,484 --> 00:19:42,269
and I'll be walking in a place
where there's 400 degrees difference...

304
00:19:42,363 --> 00:19:45,400
between sunlight and shadow.

305
00:19:45,491 --> 00:19:49,785
I can't imagine, uh,
ever topping that.

306
00:19:55,043 --> 00:19:57,581
We have that scheduled
for 0900 hours tomorrow.

307
00:19:57,671 --> 00:19:59,711
- That's not gonna work, Walter.
- Why?

308
00:19:59,756 --> 00:20:03,754
Freddo and I are gonna be goin' over the
lunar surface experiments tomorrow...

309
00:20:03,843 --> 00:20:06,251
and Ken's gonna be
back in the simulator.

310
00:20:06,304 --> 00:20:08,344
We're gonna be goin' over
the flight plan tonight.

311
00:20:08,431 --> 00:20:12,264
Gonna pay a visit to this machine
after you're hard down. Thanks.

312
00:20:12,311 --> 00:20:14,848
Jim, we've got a problem.

313
00:20:14,937 --> 00:20:20,098
We just got some blood work back from
the lab. Charlie Duke has the measles.

314
00:20:20,193 --> 00:20:22,601
So we need a new backup.

315
00:20:22,654 --> 00:20:26,567
- You've all been exposed to it.
- Oh, I've had the measles.

316
00:20:26,616 --> 00:20:29,285
Ken Mattingly hasn't.

317
00:20:29,327 --> 00:20:33,621
You wanna break up my crew
two days before the launch...

318
00:20:33,665 --> 00:20:37,912
when we can predict each other's moves,
read the tone of each other's voices?

319
00:20:37,961 --> 00:20:40,084
Ken Mattingly will be
getting seriously ill...

320
00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:44,459
precisely when you and Haise will
be ascending from the lunar surface.

321
00:20:44,509 --> 00:20:46,466
That's a lousy time for a fever.

322
00:20:46,511 --> 00:20:49,298
Jack Swigert has been
out of the loop for weeks.

323
00:20:49,348 --> 00:20:51,554
He's fully qualified
to fly this mission.

324
00:20:51,641 --> 00:20:55,224
He's a fine pilot, but when was
the last time he was in a simulator?

325
00:20:55,311 --> 00:20:58,597
I'm sorry, Jim.
I understand how you feel.

326
00:20:58,648 --> 00:21:00,606
We can do one of two things.

327
00:21:00,651 --> 00:21:03,985
We can either scrub Mattingly
and go with Swigert...

328
00:21:04,031 --> 00:21:07,278
or we can bump all three of you
to a later mission.

329
00:21:10,744 --> 00:21:15,489
I've trained
for the Fra Mauro highlands...

330
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:18,827
and this is flight surgeon
horseshit, Deke!

331
00:21:18,878 --> 00:21:23,918
Jim, if you hold out for Ken,
you will not be on Apollo 13.

332
00:21:24,007 --> 00:21:26,130
It's your decision.

333
00:21:28,221 --> 00:21:31,506
Oh, let it ring.

334
00:21:31,598 --> 00:21:34,385
Listen, I-I gotta take that.

335
00:21:34,476 --> 00:21:36,682
- Oh, why?
- Because I'm on the backup crew...

336
00:21:36,770 --> 00:21:40,602
and the backup crew has to set up
the guest list and book the hotel room.

337
00:21:40,692 --> 00:21:43,858
Swigert. Yeah.

338
00:21:43,902 --> 00:21:46,309
I looked all around

339
00:21:46,362 --> 00:21:51,191
Yes. Yes, sir.
Uh-uh, I understand.

340
00:21:51,243 --> 00:21:54,659
- Thank you, sir.
- Why don't you come with me, little girl

341
00:21:54,705 --> 00:21:56,365
On a magic carpet ride

342
00:21:56,458 --> 00:22:00,537
Well, you don't know
what we can see

343
00:22:00,586 --> 00:22:03,421
Why don't you tell
your dreams to me

344
00:22:17,019 --> 00:22:19,058
Well, I, uh...

345
00:22:22,859 --> 00:22:24,768
Damn.

346
00:22:30,033 --> 00:22:32,738
Medical guys.

347
00:22:32,785 --> 00:22:38,077
I had a feeling when they started doing
all the blood tests that, uh...

348
00:22:41,168 --> 00:22:46,081
I mean, I know it's their ass if I get
sick up there, but, I mean... Jesus!

349
00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:01,940
Oh, boy.

350
00:23:01,982 --> 00:23:05,730
Swigert, he'll be fine. He's, uh...

351
00:23:07,903 --> 00:23:09,944
He's strong.

352
00:23:12,618 --> 00:23:16,318
It'll be a hell of a mission.
One for the books.

353
00:23:20,333 --> 00:23:23,536
You sure about this?
Why don't I talk to Deke?

354
00:23:23,628 --> 00:23:26,298
I'm sure we can work this out.

355
00:23:27,841 --> 00:23:30,795
This was my call.

356
00:23:40,186 --> 00:23:42,429
Must've been a tough one.

357
00:23:47,985 --> 00:23:50,524
Look, I don't have the measles.

358
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:54,314
I'm not gonna get the measles.

359
00:23:57,997 --> 00:24:00,998
Shit. Ken, wait up.

360
00:24:04,419 --> 00:24:08,500
Trajectory is holding steady.
We're right on the line.

361
00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:14,047
We're into program 64. We're in 05 Gs,
so we're feeling that gravity now.

362
00:24:14,137 --> 00:24:18,182
Houston, we are at 400,000 feet
passing entry interphase.

363
00:24:18,225 --> 00:24:20,182
About to lose signal.

364
00:24:20,226 --> 00:24:24,854
Reentry data is nominal,
and we have radio blackout.

365
00:24:27,067 --> 00:24:30,566
What's the story here?

366
00:24:30,655 --> 00:24:34,652
I got a corridor light.
We're comin' in too shallow.

367
00:24:34,699 --> 00:24:37,536
I'm goin' to manual.

368
00:24:40,538 --> 00:24:43,872
- Houston, switching to S.C.S.
- Roger, Thirteen.

369
00:24:43,917 --> 00:24:46,705
Okay, we're at three Gs.

370
00:24:46,754 --> 00:24:49,708
Five Gs.

371
00:24:49,757 --> 00:24:51,714
We're comin' in too steep.

372
00:24:51,759 --> 00:24:55,507
I'm gonna stay in this roll,
see if I can pull us out.

373
00:24:55,555 --> 00:24:57,796
We're at eight Gs.

374
00:24:57,890 --> 00:25:00,463
Nine. Ten.

375
00:25:02,728 --> 00:25:05,729
- We're at 12 Gs.
- Twelve Gs. We're burnin' up.

376
00:25:05,773 --> 00:25:09,356
Damn it!

377
00:25:09,402 --> 00:25:12,522
I gave 'em a false indicator light
at entry interphase.

378
00:25:12,572 --> 00:25:14,564
Even Mattingly didn't
get it the first time.

379
00:25:14,615 --> 00:25:16,738
How ya feelin', Freddo?

380
00:25:16,825 --> 00:25:19,234
Char-broiled.

381
00:25:22,831 --> 00:25:24,741
So what happened?

382
00:25:24,833 --> 00:25:27,669
Came in too steep. We're dead.

383
00:25:27,754 --> 00:25:33,378
- No shit.
- Yeah, we were into program 67 there.

384
00:25:36,178 --> 00:25:39,049
Okay, we're gonna
do this again, obviously...

385
00:25:39,098 --> 00:25:41,720
but give us a minute
to get our switches reset.

386
00:25:41,768 --> 00:25:43,760
Jim, could we have a word?

387
00:25:45,939 --> 00:25:47,931
Oh, sure, Deke.

388
00:25:53,988 --> 00:25:57,524
We're going to drop off line
and debrief.

389
00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:01,232
- So?
- Well...

390
00:26:01,287 --> 00:26:05,035
if I had a dollar for every time
they killed me in this thing...

391
00:26:05,125 --> 00:26:08,079
I wouldn't have
to work for you, Deke.

392
00:26:13,132 --> 00:26:15,919
Well, we have two days.
We'll be ready.

393
00:26:15,969 --> 00:26:18,008
Let's do it again.

394
00:26:19,264 --> 00:26:21,221
Do it again.

395
00:26:31,318 --> 00:26:33,727
Margaret, get them!
Fred, Stephen, come here!

396
00:26:33,821 --> 00:26:36,228
- Daddy!
- Watch out! You'll fall!

397
00:26:36,323 --> 00:26:38,945
We can't go across that road.

398
00:26:38,993 --> 00:26:42,740
We don't want Daddy to get our germs
and get sick in outer space.

399
00:26:42,829 --> 00:26:46,744
Hey, boys. Not givin' your mom
a hard time, are ya?

400
00:26:46,834 --> 00:26:49,325
Princess, you look beautiful.

401
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:53,838
Jack!

402
00:27:11,024 --> 00:27:13,777
Well, hey, that looks
like Marilyn Lovell.

403
00:27:13,861 --> 00:27:16,861
But it can't be.
She's not coming to the launch.

404
00:27:16,947 --> 00:27:18,857
I heard it was gonna be
a hell of a show.

405
00:27:18,950 --> 00:27:20,610
Who told you that?

406
00:27:20,702 --> 00:27:23,191
Some guy I know.

407
00:27:25,915 --> 00:27:27,872
You can't live without me.

408
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:32,081
Okay, folks.
Let's say good night.

409
00:27:32,172 --> 00:27:34,378
- We got a big day tomorrow.
- Good night!

410
00:27:34,466 --> 00:27:37,300
You hear about Ken?

411
00:27:37,384 --> 00:27:40,302
Yeah.

412
00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:58,232
One, two.

413
00:27:58,282 --> 00:28:00,439
Stand back, please.

414
00:28:03,118 --> 00:28:04,992
Ah, Guenter Wendt.

415
00:28:05,078 --> 00:28:07,368
I wonder where Guenter went?

416
00:28:07,416 --> 00:28:09,573
Jim.

417
00:28:11,669 --> 00:28:15,666
- You walk on ze moon, ja?
- Ja. Ja, we walk and...

418
00:28:15,757 --> 00:28:18,462
and we talk on ze moon.

419
00:28:26,102 --> 00:28:28,425
How do you feel? Pretty good?

420
00:28:28,477 --> 00:28:32,061
Good. Might be a little
warmer in here, huh?

421
00:28:32,107 --> 00:28:35,772
- How are you today? Ready?
- Good. Yeah.

422
00:28:54,087 --> 00:28:57,752
Oh! Oh! Jeez! Oh!

423
00:29:01,302 --> 00:29:04,221
Oh, God, no!

424
00:29:08,102 --> 00:29:10,259
Oh, no.

425
00:29:14,775 --> 00:29:18,309
- Okay, we have the oxygen burn system?
- Check.

426
00:29:18,404 --> 00:29:21,488
- We have the helmet restraint ring?
- Check.

427
00:29:31,125 --> 00:29:33,497
Communication umbilical on.

428
00:29:33,585 --> 00:29:35,543
- Fred.
- What?

429
00:29:35,629 --> 00:29:37,751
- Gum.
- Aw, sorry.

430
00:29:39,508 --> 00:29:41,465
Thanks.

431
00:29:43,763 --> 00:29:46,336
I'm gonna give these guys
a beautiful ride.

432
00:29:46,391 --> 00:29:47,849
Sure you will, Jack.

433
00:30:01,239 --> 00:30:03,314
You need more air?

434
00:30:19,090 --> 00:30:21,378
You want some apple?

435
00:30:21,466 --> 00:30:23,377
- Marilyn, hey!
- Mary.

436
00:30:23,469 --> 00:30:25,711
Aw, I hate this already.

437
00:30:25,764 --> 00:30:27,886
You're not just about to pop,
are you?

438
00:30:27,974 --> 00:30:31,842
No. I got 30 days
'til this blast-off.

439
00:31:15,730 --> 00:31:17,687
This is for Gene.

440
00:31:20,318 --> 00:31:23,852
Mrs. Kranz has pulled out
the needle and thread again.

441
00:31:23,947 --> 00:31:26,272
The last one looked like
he bought it off a gypsy.

442
00:31:26,365 --> 00:31:28,822
Well, you can't argue with tradition.

443
00:31:28,910 --> 00:31:30,819
Copy that.

444
00:31:30,913 --> 00:31:32,905
This is from your wife, Gene.

445
00:31:32,956 --> 00:31:34,913
Thank you, Tom.

446
00:31:34,958 --> 00:31:37,081
I was startin' to get worried.

447
00:31:38,294 --> 00:31:40,251
There we go.

448
00:31:40,296 --> 00:31:44,509
- I like it. I like that one, Gene.
- Sharp, Gene.

449
00:31:58,231 --> 00:32:00,640
Jim, you're all set.

450
00:32:10,036 --> 00:32:12,111
Very sharp.

451
00:32:12,162 --> 00:32:14,488
Hey, Gene, I guess we can go now.

452
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:17,160
Save it for splashdown, guys.

453
00:32:36,062 --> 00:32:39,846
Apollo 13 flight controllers,
listen up.

454
00:32:39,941 --> 00:32:42,479
Give me a go,
no go for launch.

455
00:32:42,527 --> 00:32:44,814
- Booster.
- Go.
- RETRO.

456
00:32:44,861 --> 00:32:46,653
- Go.

00:32:50,535 --> 00:32:52,527
- We're go, Flight.
- GNC.
- We're go.

460
00:32:52,578 --> 00:32:54,820

00:32:54,872 --> 00:32:56,699

464
00:33:01,753 --> 00:33:03,996
- CAPCOM.
- We're go, Flight.

465
00:33:04,049 --> 00:33:08,046
Launch Control, this is Houston.
We are go for launch.

466
00:33:08,094 --> 00:33:10,880
Roger that, Houston.

467
00:33:10,971 --> 00:33:13,379
Pad leader, what's your status?

468
00:33:13,432 --> 00:33:15,510
We are go for launch.

469
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:18,050
T minus 60 seconds and counting.

470
00:33:42,002 --> 00:33:45,337
- Stand by.
- Roger.

471
00:34:02,441 --> 00:34:04,765
Fuel pumps.

472
00:34:04,817 --> 00:34:08,269
This is it. A few bumps
and we're haulin' the mail.

473
00:34:13,994 --> 00:34:18,240
Control, this is Guidance.
They're ready for takeoff.

474
00:34:20,458 --> 00:34:22,285
We are go for launch.

475
00:34:22,544 --> 00:34:26,412
- T minus...
- 15... 14...

476
00:34:26,465 --> 00:34:30,414
13... 12... 11...

477
00:34:30,468 --> 00:34:32,426
ten... nine...

478
00:34:32,471 --> 00:34:34,878
eight... seven...

479
00:34:34,974 --> 00:34:37,974
six... ignition sequence starts...

480
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:41,892
three... two... one...

481
00:34:41,981 --> 00:34:43,890
ignition!

482
00:35:05,213 --> 00:35:07,786
The clock is running!

483
00:35:15,389 --> 00:35:18,010
We have lift-off!

484
00:35:30,863 --> 00:35:35,857
Houston, we have cleared
the tower at 1313.

485
00:35:35,951 --> 00:35:38,027
Okay, guys, we got it.

486
00:35:51,132 --> 00:35:53,803
Come on, baby. Come on.

487
00:35:57,891 --> 00:36:00,215
Altitude is on the line.

488
00:36:00,310 --> 00:36:03,061
Velocity right on the line.

489
00:36:04,397 --> 00:36:06,520
Roll complete. We are pitching.

490
00:36:06,565 --> 00:36:10,730
Thirteen, stand by
for mode one Bravo.

491
00:36:14,783 --> 00:36:17,274
FIDO, how we lookin'?

492
00:36:17,368 --> 00:36:20,073
Looks good, Flight.
Right down the middle.

493
00:36:20,121 --> 00:36:25,163
We see your B.P.C.
Is clear, Thirteen.

494
00:36:25,251 --> 00:36:27,577
Roger. E.D.S. To manual.

495
00:36:27,671 --> 00:36:30,421
Inboard.

496
00:36:30,506 --> 00:36:33,710
Get ready for a little jolt, fellas.

497
00:36:47,023 --> 00:36:49,729
That was some little jolt.

498
00:36:54,364 --> 00:36:56,440
Tower jett.

499
00:37:05,959 --> 00:37:09,459
Houston, we've got a center engine
cutoff. Go on the other four.

500
00:37:13,008 --> 00:37:15,759
Roger that, Thirteen.
We show the same.

501
00:37:15,803 --> 00:37:17,960
Booster, can you
confirm that cutoff?

502
00:37:18,055 --> 00:37:21,305
- Roger. Looks like we lost it.
- FIDO, what's that going to do?

503
00:37:21,351 --> 00:37:22,809
Stand by, Flight.

504
00:37:22,852 --> 00:37:25,602
I need to know if the I.U.'s
correcting for the shutdown.

505
00:37:35,322 --> 00:37:37,813
Houston, what's the story
on engine five?

506
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:44,158
We're still go. We'll be all right
as long as we don't lose another one.

507
00:37:44,247 --> 00:37:48,162
- Roger that.
- Thirteen, we're not sure
why the inboard was out...

508
00:37:48,211 --> 00:37:51,329
but the other engines are go,
so we're gonna burn those engines...

509
00:37:51,421 --> 00:37:53,331
a little bit longer.

510
00:37:53,423 --> 00:37:56,175
Roger that.
Our gimbals are good.

511
00:37:56,218 --> 00:37:58,969
Our trim is good.

512
00:38:00,764 --> 00:38:03,802
Looks like we just had
our glitch for this mission.

513
00:38:14,028 --> 00:38:17,279
- 13, stand by for staging.
- Roger that.

514
00:38:17,366 --> 00:38:21,493
S-2 shutdown. S-4B ignition.

515
00:38:21,535 --> 00:38:23,860
Thrust looks good, Flight.

516
00:38:25,374 --> 00:38:27,662
Flight, S-4B cutoff
in ten seconds.

517
00:38:27,709 --> 00:38:32,085
Thirteen, this is Houston.
Predicted cutoff is 12 plus 34, over.

518
00:38:32,170 --> 00:38:36,963
Coming up on 12 minutes 34.

519
00:38:38,052 --> 00:38:41,007
- And...
- SECO!

520
00:38:41,056 --> 00:38:43,678
Shutdown.

521
00:38:43,725 --> 00:38:48,102
And that, gentlemen,
is how we do that.

522
00:39:13,421 --> 00:39:15,912
Oh, boy. Hope I can sleep.

523
00:39:15,965 --> 00:39:18,042
Mom, that was loud.

524
00:39:18,093 --> 00:39:20,761
Here, hold my hand.

525
00:39:20,845 --> 00:39:23,515
I can't believe
you did this four times.

526
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:25,009
The worst part's over.

527
00:39:25,099 --> 00:39:27,175
It is?

528
00:39:27,268 --> 00:39:32,144
Listen, this doesn't stop for me
until he lands on that aircraft carrier.

529
00:39:32,232 --> 00:39:34,355
Well, you just look
so calm about it.

530
00:39:34,443 --> 00:39:38,736
If the flight surgeon had to okay me
for this mission, I'd be grounded.

531
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:41,616
Mrs. Lovell! Mrs. Haise!
Can we speak to you?

532
00:39:41,659 --> 00:39:43,864
Can we just have
a word with you?

533
00:39:43,952 --> 00:39:46,408
Remember, you're proud,
happy and thrilled.

534
00:39:46,455 --> 00:39:47,913
Mrs. Lovell!

535
00:39:47,956 --> 00:39:50,743
- How're ya feeling?
- Well, very proud...

536
00:39:50,793 --> 00:39:53,080
and very happy,
and we're thrilled.

537
00:39:56,632 --> 00:39:59,751
Flight, Booster.
I show S-4B shutdown.

538
00:39:59,801 --> 00:40:02,803
T.L.I. Is on the money.
Looks good, Flight.

539
00:40:02,847 --> 00:40:05,301
Roger, FIDO.

540
00:40:05,348 --> 00:40:10,225
Okay, guys.
We're goin' to the moon.

541
00:40:10,312 --> 00:40:13,064
Flight, we have reacquisition
of signal at Hawaii.

542
00:40:13,148 --> 00:40:15,057
Flight, everything looks good.

543
00:40:15,151 --> 00:40:17,987
Okay, Houston. C.M.P. Here.

544
00:40:18,029 --> 00:40:21,314
I've exchanged couches with Jim.
I'm in the pilot's seat.

545
00:40:21,365 --> 00:40:26,157
I'm gonna go ahead and get set
for transposition and docking.

546
00:40:26,203 --> 00:40:28,742
Roger that, Jack.

547
00:40:40,259 --> 00:40:42,667
Freddo, you okay?

548
00:40:46,182 --> 00:40:49,466
Okay, let's get turned around
and pick up the lunar module.

549
00:40:49,517 --> 00:40:53,267
Odyssey, you're go
for pyro arm and docking,

550
00:40:53,355 --> 00:40:56,522
and we recommend you secure
cabin pressurization.

551
00:40:56,567 --> 00:40:59,354
Roger that.

552
00:40:59,403 --> 00:41:04,279
Okay, we're ready
for C.S.M. Separation.

553
00:41:04,366 --> 00:41:08,994
Okay, S.M.R.C.S.
Isol valves are all gray.

554
00:41:09,038 --> 00:41:11,280
Okay, Swigert,
command module pilot...

555
00:41:11,374 --> 00:41:13,614
she's all yours.

556
00:41:17,297 --> 00:41:20,001
Houston, we've got
a good separation.

557
00:41:20,049 --> 00:41:22,802
- The S-4B is stable.
- Translation looks good.

558
00:41:22,886 --> 00:41:26,385
- We confirm that, Thirteen.
- We're gonna start to pitch around...

559
00:41:26,472 --> 00:41:28,381
to line up with the LEM.

560
00:41:28,474 --> 00:41:30,467
You know, Freddo, Frank Borman...

561
00:41:30,561 --> 00:41:33,514
was upchuckin' most of the way
to the moon on Apollo 8.

562
00:41:33,563 --> 00:41:37,643
I'm all right. I just ate too much
breakfast. Let's go to work.

563
00:41:39,068 --> 00:41:41,060
And pitching up.

564
00:41:41,154 --> 00:41:44,569
Pitch rate,
2.5 degrees per second.

565
00:41:44,615 --> 00:41:48,234
Roger, Jack.
We see you pitching around.

566
00:41:48,286 --> 00:41:50,245
Keep an eye on that telemetry.

567
00:41:50,290 --> 00:41:54,665
Roger that. If Swigert can't dock
this thing, we don't have a mission.

568
00:41:55,752 --> 00:41:59,251
- How's the alignment?
- G.D.C. Align.

569
00:42:03,594 --> 00:42:06,879
Thrusting forward.

570
00:42:06,930 --> 00:42:09,218
One hundred feet.

571
00:42:13,312 --> 00:42:15,933
Watch the alignment, now.

572
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:26,404
Ah, don't worry, guys.

573
00:42:26,450 --> 00:42:28,906
I'm on top of it.

574
00:42:31,955 --> 00:42:37,709
- FIDO, let me know when you're ready.
- Okay, let's uplink that.

575
00:42:37,794 --> 00:42:40,795
- How we lookin'?
- We're not there yet. Forty feet.

576
00:42:42,508 --> 00:42:44,797
Twenty.

577
00:42:48,847 --> 00:42:51,172
Come on, rookie,
park that thing.

578
00:42:56,980 --> 00:42:58,808
Ten feet.

579
00:43:09,994 --> 00:43:12,566
- Capture.
- That's it.

580
00:43:12,662 --> 00:43:16,079
- Talk back is barber pole.
- Go ahead and retract.

581
00:43:19,670 --> 00:43:21,958
Houston, we have hard dock.

582
00:43:22,006 --> 00:43:25,126
Roger, understand.
That's a good deal, Jack.

583
00:43:25,176 --> 00:43:27,748
Let's start back up with procedure 17.

584
00:43:27,886 --> 00:43:31,421
Okay, Houston, we have LEM extraction.

585
00:43:31,516 --> 00:43:33,508
We copy that, Thirteen.

586
00:43:33,559 --> 00:43:35,801
Now you're off
to the Fra Mauro highlands.

587
00:43:35,853 --> 00:43:39,720
- I gotta get out of this suit.
- Houston, we are ready...

588
00:43:39,815 --> 00:43:41,938
for the beginning
of the P.T. C...

589
00:43:42,026 --> 00:43:46,354
and I think once we're in that
barbecue roll, uh, Jack and I will eat.

590
00:43:46,405 --> 00:43:48,979
- Hey, I'm hungry.
- Are you sure?

591
00:43:49,033 --> 00:43:52,615
I could eat the ass
out of a dead rhinoceros.

592
00:43:56,166 --> 00:43:58,870
- We got a smooth one, huh?
- By the numbers so far.

593
00:43:58,919 --> 00:44:03,711
We just ran a minimum load test on the
cooling system. Let me clean this up.

594
00:44:03,757 --> 00:44:05,879
- See you tomorrow.
- Take care.

595
00:44:20,064 --> 00:44:22,472
It's too bad we can't
demonstrate this on TV.

596
00:44:24,068 --> 00:44:26,606
What a shame.

597
00:44:30,743 --> 00:44:33,908
Okay. Overboard dump comin' up.

598
00:44:36,789 --> 00:44:39,707
Here it comes...

599
00:44:39,751 --> 00:44:41,743
the constellation Urion.

600
00:44:45,299 --> 00:44:47,919
Now, that's a beautiful sight.

601
00:44:47,967 --> 00:44:51,918
Barbara. Barbara, we are going
to your father's broadcast.

602
00:44:51,972 --> 00:44:54,593
No! I'm never coming out!

603
00:44:54,641 --> 00:44:58,806
I hate Paul! No one else
can ever play their records again!

604
00:44:58,896 --> 00:45:02,264
She's still going on about
the stupid Beatles breaking up?

605
00:45:02,315 --> 00:45:05,186
- They're not stupid! You're stupid!
- Barbara!

606
00:45:05,276 --> 00:45:06,687
I know you're in mourning.

607
00:45:06,777 --> 00:45:09,151
I'm not going, Mom!
Dad won't know if we're there!

608
00:45:09,239 --> 00:45:13,782
The whole world is going to be watching
this broadcast, and so are we.

609
00:45:13,826 --> 00:45:15,784
Excuse me while I...

610
00:45:16,038 --> 00:45:19,158
Okay, uh, good evening, America...

611
00:45:19,250 --> 00:45:22,036
and welcome aboard Apollo 13.

612
00:45:22,127 --> 00:45:26,042
I'm Jim Lovell, and we're
broadcasting to you tonight...

613
00:45:26,131 --> 00:45:29,962
from an altitude of almost
200,000 miles...

614
00:45:30,051 --> 00:45:32,923
away from the face
of the earth...

615
00:45:32,972 --> 00:45:35,889
and we have a pretty good show
in store for you tonight.

616
00:45:35,975 --> 00:45:38,133
We are going
to show you just what...

617
00:45:38,227 --> 00:45:41,975
- Susan. Barbara.
- Our life is like for the three of us...

618
00:45:42,064 --> 00:45:44,816
- in the vast expanse of outer space.
- Double!

619
00:45:44,900 --> 00:45:47,438
One of the first things
we'd like to do...

620
00:45:47,486 --> 00:45:50,772
is provide you with the
appropriate background music.

621
00:45:51,824 --> 00:45:54,493
So, uh, hit it there, Freddo.

622
00:45:54,534 --> 00:45:57,821
Hello, world!

623
00:46:09,508 --> 00:46:13,922
That, uh, was supposed
to be the theme to 2001...

624
00:46:14,013 --> 00:46:16,504
in honor of
our command module Odyssey...

625
00:46:16,599 --> 00:46:20,347
but there seems to have been
a change in the program.

626
00:46:20,394 --> 00:46:25,139
When I go up on 19, I'm gonna take my
entire collection of Johnny Cash along.

627
00:46:28,236 --> 00:46:31,404
- Hey, Marilyn.
- Where's their broadcast?

628
00:46:32,657 --> 00:46:34,696
All the networks dumped us.

629
00:46:34,742 --> 00:46:36,900
One of them said we made
goin' to the moon...

630
00:46:36,995 --> 00:46:39,664
as exciting as a trip to Pittsburgh.

631
00:46:40,706 --> 00:46:43,244
My son's supposed to be on.

632
00:46:43,335 --> 00:46:45,873
He's in outer space.

633
00:46:45,962 --> 00:46:50,789
This is all the channels
we get, Mrs. Lovell.

634
00:46:52,051 --> 00:46:55,052
It's that damn TV Guide again.

635
00:46:55,096 --> 00:46:57,669
Ruthless porters.

636
00:46:57,724 --> 00:46:59,717
Savage baggage masters...

637
00:47:05,106 --> 00:47:08,024
When I was just a lad of ten

638
00:47:08,068 --> 00:47:11,318
My father said to me

639
00:47:11,406 --> 00:47:14,903
- Come here and take...
- Do they know they're not on the air?

640
00:47:14,990 --> 00:47:17,564
We'll tell them
when they get back.

641
00:47:17,618 --> 00:47:19,660
Don't put your faith
in love, my boy

642
00:47:19,747 --> 00:47:22,415
My father said to me

643
00:47:22,457 --> 00:47:26,407
Uh, well, if anyone from the,
uh, I.R.S. Is watching...

644
00:47:26,503 --> 00:47:29,587
I forgot to file my 1040 return.

645
00:47:29,672 --> 00:47:32,246
I meant to do it today, but, uh...

646
00:47:32,342 --> 00:47:34,668
That's no joke.
They'll jump on him.

647
00:47:36,763 --> 00:47:40,512
Well, folks, let's head on down
to the lunar excursion module.

648
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:42,011
Follow me.

649
00:47:42,102 --> 00:47:44,771
Now, when we get ready
to land on the moon...

650
00:47:44,812 --> 00:47:48,811
Fred Haise and I will float
through this access tunnel...

651
00:47:48,901 --> 00:47:50,858
into the lunar module, leaving...

652
00:47:50,945 --> 00:47:54,028
EECOM, that stir's gonna be...

653
00:47:54,113 --> 00:47:57,697
on both H2 and both O2 tanks,
is that correct?

654
00:47:57,784 --> 00:47:59,944
...the spacecraft
will remain connected.

655
00:48:01,996 --> 00:48:04,998
Well, folks, as you can
probably tell...

656
00:48:05,084 --> 00:48:08,287
the Aquarius isn't much bigger
than a couple of telephone booths.

657
00:48:08,337 --> 00:48:10,827
The skin of the LEM
in some places...

658
00:48:10,922 --> 00:48:13,130
is only as...

659
00:48:13,175 --> 00:48:15,749
as thick as a couple of layers...

660
00:48:15,803 --> 00:48:19,302
of tinfoil, and that's all that
protects us from the vacuum of space.

661
00:48:19,348 --> 00:48:24,307
We get away with this because the LEM is
designed only for flight in outer space.

662
00:48:24,395 --> 00:48:28,475
Fred Haise, Renaissance man.

663
00:48:28,524 --> 00:48:33,233
Okay, we'll head back up the tunnel now
and back into the Odyssey.

664
00:48:34,821 --> 00:48:38,985
When you and your baby
have a fallin' out

665
00:48:39,076 --> 00:48:42,077
All right, we've returned to the...

666
00:48:42,162 --> 00:48:45,164
Stand by one, Houston.

667
00:48:45,249 --> 00:48:47,621
Gotcha!

668
00:48:47,667 --> 00:48:51,666
Houston, that bang you heard was
Fred Haise on the cabin repress valve.

669
00:48:51,755 --> 00:48:54,377
He gets our hearts goin'
every time with that one.

670
00:48:54,467 --> 00:48:56,958
We'll go honky tonkin'
'round this town

671
00:48:57,011 --> 00:49:02,052
Okay, we're, uh, about
to close out the Aquarius...

672
00:49:02,140 --> 00:49:04,845
and, uh, return to the Odyssey.

673
00:49:04,893 --> 00:49:09,852
Our next broadcast will be from
Fra Mauro on the surface of the moon.

674
00:49:09,940 --> 00:49:15,314
So, uh, this is the crew
of the Apollo 13...

675
00:49:15,362 --> 00:49:18,778
wishing everyone
back on Earth a...

676
00:49:18,867 --> 00:49:21,155
a pleasant evening.

677
00:49:24,539 --> 00:49:27,622
All right.

678
00:49:28,710 --> 00:49:30,701
Daddy was funny.

679
00:49:30,753 --> 00:49:33,209
They might air a few minutes
of it on the news tonight.

680
00:49:33,256 --> 00:49:36,294
You'd think so.

681
00:49:36,385 --> 00:49:38,507
- Bye.
- Bye.

682
00:49:38,803 --> 00:49:43,015
Well, between Jack's back taxes
and the Fred Haise Show...

683
00:49:43,099 --> 00:49:46,514
I'd say that was a pretty
successful broadcast.

684
00:49:46,602 --> 00:49:50,186
- That was an excellent show.
- Thank you very much, Houston.

685
00:49:50,273 --> 00:49:52,516
We've got a couple of
housekeeping procedures.

686
00:49:52,610 --> 00:49:57,355
We'd like you to roll right
to 0-6-0 and null your rates.

687
00:49:57,447 --> 00:50:01,279
Roger that.
Rolling right, 0-6-0.

688
00:50:05,372 --> 00:50:09,238
And then if you could give
your oxygen tanks a stir.

689
00:50:09,334 --> 00:50:11,160
Roger that.

690
00:50:45,038 --> 00:50:47,659
Hey, we've got a problem here.

691
00:50:47,706 --> 00:50:50,375
- What did you do?
- Nothing. I stirred the tanks.

692
00:50:50,417 --> 00:50:52,909
- Whoa!
- Hey!

693
00:50:54,839 --> 00:50:58,882
Uh, this is Houston.
Say again please.

694
00:50:58,968 --> 00:51:04,044
Houston, we have a problem.
We have a main bus B undervolt.

695
00:51:04,139 --> 00:51:07,389
- We've got a lot
of thruster activity here.
- What's with the computer now?

696
00:51:07,434 --> 00:51:11,598
It just went off line.
There's another master alarm.

697
00:51:11,689 --> 00:51:13,682
- I'm checking the quad.
- That was no repress valve.

698
00:51:13,733 --> 00:51:16,567
- Maybe it's in quad C.
I'm gonna reconfigure the R.C.S.
- We've got a computer restart.

699
00:51:16,653 --> 00:51:18,775
- We've got a ping light.
- The way these are firing
doesn't make sense.

700
00:51:18,863 --> 00:51:22,397
We've got multiple caution and warning,
Houston. We've got to reset and restart.

701
00:51:22,491 --> 00:51:24,781
I'm going to S.C.S.

702
00:51:26,788 --> 00:51:29,741
Jesus. Flight, their
heart rates are skyrocketing.

703
00:51:29,831 --> 00:51:33,497
- EECOM, what's your data telling you?
- O2 tank two not reading at all.

704
00:51:33,586 --> 00:51:37,205
Tank one is at 725 psi
and falling.

705
00:51:37,257 --> 00:51:40,840
Fuel cells one and three
are, uh...

706
00:51:40,927 --> 00:51:43,548
Oh, boy, what's going on here?
Flight, let me get back to you.

707
00:51:43,596 --> 00:51:46,680
Flight, GNC.
They're all over the place.

708
00:51:46,765 --> 00:51:49,518
- They keep yawing close to gimbal lock.
- I keep losing radio signal.

709
00:51:49,602 --> 00:51:51,511
Flight, their antennae
must be flipped around.

710
00:51:51,605 --> 00:51:53,893
They're gonna have to do it
manually if they do it at all.

711
00:51:53,940 --> 00:51:55,517
One at a time, people.

712
00:51:55,607 --> 00:51:59,605
Is this an instrumentation problem
or are we looking at real power loss?

713
00:51:59,696 --> 00:52:02,102
It's reading a quadruple failure.
That can't happen.

714
00:52:02,156 --> 00:52:04,113
It's got to be
instrumentation.

715
00:52:04,158 --> 00:52:06,994
Let's get the hatch buttoned.
The LEM might have been hit by a meteor.

716
00:52:07,078 --> 00:52:10,031
The tunnel's really torquin'
with all this movement.

717
00:52:10,122 --> 00:52:13,574
Houston, we had a pretty large bang
there associated with a master alarm.

718
00:52:13,626 --> 00:52:16,199
Shit, it's main bus A.

719
00:52:16,296 --> 00:52:21,207
- Main bus A undervolt?
- Main bus A undervolt down to...

720
00:52:21,302 --> 00:52:25,169
It's reading 25 and a half.
Main bus B is reading zip now.

721
00:52:25,264 --> 00:52:27,421
We got a wicked shimmy up here.

722
00:52:27,473 --> 00:52:30,179
These guys are talking
about bangs and shimmies.

723
00:52:30,268 --> 00:52:32,178
Doesn't sound like instrumentation.

724
00:52:32,270 --> 00:52:34,974
- You are breaking up, 13.
- Can't get this hatch to seal.

725
00:52:35,063 --> 00:52:39,477
Just stow it. If we'd been hit
by a meteor, we'd be dead by now.

726
00:52:39,569 --> 00:52:41,610
I'm gonna try to get us
out of this lurch.

727
00:52:41,655 --> 00:52:44,324
Houston, did you say
switch to omni Bravo?

728
00:52:44,407 --> 00:52:47,658
- Roger that, Thirteen.
- The signal strength went way down.

729
00:52:47,703 --> 00:52:50,656
It's fighting me. What's the story?
We keep flirting with gimbal lock.

730
00:52:50,705 --> 00:52:55,664
We need a confirmation.
What systems do you have down?

731
00:52:55,752 --> 00:52:58,836
- I'm having a hard time, Rick.
- S.M.R.C.S. Helium one.

732
00:52:58,922 --> 00:53:01,793
- Did you say switch to omni Charlie?
- A and C are barber pole.

733
00:53:01,841 --> 00:53:04,712
Houston, I'm switching over
quad C to main A.

734
00:53:04,803 --> 00:53:06,214
Roger that, Thirteen.

735
00:53:06,304 --> 00:53:09,509
Okay, Houston, fuel cell one,
fuel cell three.

736
00:53:09,558 --> 00:53:13,557
We got a main bus B undervolt,
cryo pressure, suit compressor.

737
00:53:13,647 --> 00:53:18,852
What don't we have?
A.C. Bus one, A.C. Bus two...

738
00:53:18,943 --> 00:53:22,192
command module computer
and O2 flow high.

739
00:53:22,279 --> 00:53:24,852
I don't know. Maybe this is
a caution and warning failure.

740
00:53:24,948 --> 00:53:30,073
Houston, we are venting
something out into space.

741
00:53:30,161 --> 00:53:35,667
I can see it outside
of window one right now.

742
00:53:35,709 --> 00:53:40,620
It's definitely, uh...
a gas of some sort.

743
00:53:42,674 --> 00:53:45,676
It's got to be the oxygen.

744
00:54:02,569 --> 00:54:05,060
Roger, Odyssey.
We copy your venting.

745
00:54:05,532 --> 00:54:08,733
- Give me an alignment.
- Let's think about the kind
of things we can connect.

746
00:54:08,826 --> 00:54:11,613
- Let's start back at the beginning.
- Anything look abnormal?

747
00:54:23,299 --> 00:54:26,300
Okay, listen up. Quiet down, people.

748
00:54:27,594 --> 00:54:32,304
Quiet down. Quiet down.
Let's stay cool, people.

749
00:54:32,392 --> 00:54:35,476
Procedures, I need another
computer up in the R.T.C.C.

750
00:54:35,560 --> 00:54:38,313
I want everybody to alert
your support teams.

751
00:54:38,397 --> 00:54:41,149
Wake up anybody you need
and get them in here.

752
00:54:41,233 --> 00:54:43,476
Let's work the problem, people.

753
00:54:43,569 --> 00:54:46,026
Let's not make things worse
by guessin'.

754
00:54:46,114 --> 00:54:50,325
13, this is Houston. We are going around
the room. We're gonna get you answers.

755
00:54:50,410 --> 00:54:54,158
We keep venting, we're gonna keep
hitting the edge of that deadband.

756
00:54:54,247 --> 00:54:56,572
Take a look at the O2
on number one.

757
00:55:01,296 --> 00:55:04,297
200 pounds and falling.

758
00:55:04,382 --> 00:55:06,505
O2 tank two still zero.

759
00:55:06,592 --> 00:55:10,176
- Tank one: 218 psi and falling.
- Is that what you're gettin'? Confirm.

760
00:55:10,263 --> 00:55:14,676
- We're seeing the same, 13.
- Can we review our status, Sy?

761
00:55:14,767 --> 00:55:19,429
Let's look at this thing
from a standpoint of status.

762
00:55:21,148 --> 00:55:25,811
What have we got
on the spacecraft that's good?

763
00:55:27,364 --> 00:55:30,649
I'll get back to you, Gene.

764
00:55:32,785 --> 00:55:35,158
We're not gonna have
power much longer.

765
00:55:35,205 --> 00:55:38,539
The ship's bleedin' to death.

766
00:55:45,382 --> 00:55:48,169
- Flight?
- Yeah. Go, EECOM.

767
00:55:48,218 --> 00:55:52,299
Um, Flight, I recommend we shut down
the reactant valves of the fuel cells.

768
00:55:53,766 --> 00:55:57,180
What the hell good
is that gonna do?

769
00:55:57,268 --> 00:55:59,178
If that's where the leak is,
we can isolate it.

770
00:55:59,271 --> 00:56:02,854
We can isolate it there,
save what's left in the tanks,
and we can run on the good cell.

771
00:56:02,941 --> 00:56:04,850
You close 'em,
you can't open 'em again.

772
00:56:04,943 --> 00:56:07,518
You can't land on the moon
with one healthy fuel cell.

773
00:56:07,572 --> 00:56:10,856
Gene, the Odyssey is dying.

774
00:56:10,907 --> 00:56:13,742
From my chair here,
this is the last option.

775
00:56:21,752 --> 00:56:25,370
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay, Sy.

776
00:56:38,394 --> 00:56:41,762
CAPCOM, let's have them
close the reactant valves.

777
00:56:41,856 --> 00:56:44,809
Thirteen, this is Houston.

778
00:56:44,901 --> 00:56:50,524
We want you to close react valves
on cells one and three. Do you copy?

779
00:56:50,573 --> 00:56:54,820
Are you saying you want
the whole smash?

780
00:56:54,911 --> 00:56:58,991
Closing down the react valves
for fuel cells shut down?

781
00:56:59,082 --> 00:57:02,747
Shutting down the fuel cells?
Did I hear you right?

782
00:57:02,836 --> 00:57:05,670
Yeah, they heard me right.

783
00:57:05,755 --> 00:57:09,455
Tell them we think that's
the only way they can stop the leak.

784
00:57:09,549 --> 00:57:14,177
Yeah, Jim. We think that closing
the react valves may stop the leak.

785
00:57:24,440 --> 00:57:27,691
- Did he copy that?
- Do you copy, Jim?

786
00:57:29,195 --> 00:57:31,768
Yes, Houston, we copy.

787
00:57:36,870 --> 00:57:41,116
We just lost the moon.

788
00:57:48,547 --> 00:57:50,707
Okay, Freddo,
shut those down.

789
00:57:52,719 --> 00:57:54,629
Let's see what this does.

790
00:58:03,230 --> 00:58:05,471
If this doesn't work...

791
00:58:05,564 --> 00:58:08,353
we're not gonna have enough
power left to get home.

792
00:58:26,378 --> 00:58:28,999
- Shit!
- Goddamn it!

793
00:58:29,047 --> 00:58:32,298
Houston, O2 on one is still falling.

794
00:58:34,303 --> 00:58:37,635
Freddo, how long does it take
to power up the LEM?

795
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:39,839
Three hours by the checklist.

796
00:58:39,891 --> 00:58:42,382
We don't have that much time.

797
00:58:42,478 --> 00:58:44,517
Shit!

798
00:58:44,604 --> 00:58:49,646
Okay, now, Jack, before the batteries
completely die on us in here...

799
00:58:49,694 --> 00:58:54,651
let's power down everything so we can
save as much as we can for reentry.

800
00:58:54,698 --> 00:58:58,317
Fifteen minutes of oxygen and that's it.
The command module will be dead.

801
00:58:58,369 --> 00:59:01,488
Okay. Okay, guys, listen up.
Here's the drill.

802
00:59:01,538 --> 00:59:03,994
We're moving the astronauts
over to the LEM.

803
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:05,997
We've got to get some oxygen up there.

804
00:59:06,043 --> 00:59:09,494
TELMU, Control, I want emergency power
procedure; essential hardware only.

805
00:59:09,546 --> 00:59:13,841
GNC, EECOM, we're gonna be shutting down
the command module at the same time.

806
00:59:13,885 --> 00:59:16,505
We'll have to transfer the guidance
system from one computer to the other...

807
00:59:16,554 --> 00:59:19,424
so I want those numbers up and ready
when our guys are in position.

808
00:59:19,515 --> 00:59:21,840
We've gotta transfer all control
data over the LEM computer...

809
00:59:21,892 --> 00:59:23,849
before the command module dies.

810
00:59:23,894 --> 00:59:25,886
The lunar module
just became a lifeboat.

811
00:59:26,355 --> 00:59:30,352
Odyssey, this is Houston.
We need you to power down immediately.

812
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:33,733
You're gonna have to power up
the LEM at the same time, so you
better get somebody over there.

813
00:59:33,821 --> 00:59:36,692
We already have Freddo
in the LEM, Houston.

814
00:59:36,740 --> 00:59:39,197
We've got serious time pressure.

815
00:59:39,244 --> 00:59:41,698
You've got to get
the guidance program transferred,

816
00:59:41,745 --> 00:59:44,367
and you've got to do it before you're
out of power in the command module...

817
00:59:44,415 --> 00:59:46,870
or you're not gonna be able
to navigate up there.

818
00:59:46,917 --> 00:59:48,910
How much time?
Can you give me a number?

819
00:59:49,003 --> 00:59:53,083
Well, we're looking at less than 15
minutes of life support in the Odyssey.

820
00:59:55,344 --> 01:00:01,048
We've got 15 minutes, Freddo.
It's worse than I thought.

821
01:00:01,098 --> 01:00:05,143
Houston, be aware I've moved
from the command module into the LEM.

822
01:00:07,230 --> 01:00:10,729
If Jack can't get that guidance computer
data transferred before they go dead...

823
01:00:10,774 --> 01:00:13,230
- They won't even know
which way they're pointed.
- That's right.

824
01:00:13,277 --> 01:00:15,983
- That's a bad way to fly.
- I'll be in 210 if you need me.

825
01:00:18,074 --> 01:00:21,941
Houston, this is Thirteen.
Are you back with me now?

826
01:00:21,995 --> 01:00:26,740
Aquarius, this is Houston. You now have
about 12 minutes to power up.

827
01:00:26,791 --> 01:00:31,002
I can't see any stars. Man, there's a
lot of debris floatin' around out there.

828
01:00:31,086 --> 01:00:35,168
Okay, Houston, I have completed
the steps on page 15.

829
01:00:35,259 --> 01:00:37,167
Now I'm ready
to power down the computer.

830
01:00:37,260 --> 01:00:40,629
I'm gonna need
your gimbal angles, Jack...

831
01:00:40,722 --> 01:00:44,968
- before you shut down the computer!
- Okay, Jim.

832
01:00:45,018 --> 01:00:47,176
I need this back to me
before they power down.

833
01:00:47,271 --> 01:00:49,263
All right, all right.
I got it. Hold on.

834
01:00:49,314 --> 01:00:54,189
- Houston, our computer is up.
- Roger. Stand by.

835
01:00:54,277 --> 01:00:58,856
Jack, we need to proceed with
steps 12 through 17 quickly.

836
01:00:58,949 --> 01:01:03,492
You're down to about
eight minutes remaining.

837
01:01:03,537 --> 01:01:05,862
Fuel cell pump's off.
O2 fans, tank two off.

838
01:01:05,955 --> 01:01:09,869
Okay, Houston, check me. I have
completed these gimbal conversions...

839
01:01:09,960 --> 01:01:13,542
but I need a double check
of the arithmetic.

840
01:01:13,631 --> 01:01:18,007
- Yeah, you can go, Jim.
- The roll CAL angle is minus two.

841
01:01:18,051 --> 01:01:21,550
Lunar module roll is 355.57.

842
01:01:21,639 --> 01:01:27,475
Pitch: 1678... Correction.
Pitch: 167.78.

843
01:01:27,520 --> 01:01:32,513
- Yaw is 351.87.
- Stand by. We're checking it.

844
01:01:32,565 --> 01:01:35,021
We've got negative visibility
in our star field,

845
01:01:35,068 --> 01:01:40,195
and if this paperwork isn't right,
who knows where we'll end up out here?

846
01:01:46,413 --> 01:01:48,371
Looks good, Flight.

847
01:01:48,416 --> 01:01:50,491
- It's all right.
- Good here.

848
01:01:50,542 --> 01:01:52,999
- He's good, Andy.
- We'll go on those numbers.

849
01:01:53,045 --> 01:01:55,038
- You're good.
- Log them in, Freddo.

850
01:01:55,089 --> 01:01:57,544
Jack, turn off the I.M.U.
Switch to S.C.S.

851
01:01:57,591 --> 01:02:00,047
Stand by to turn off
the thrusters. Over.

852
01:02:00,511 --> 01:02:03,714
It's a great day in New York.
It's girl watchers' weather.

853
01:02:03,807 --> 01:02:06,379
I like those ingenious girl watchers
who put on Con Edison helmets...

854
01:02:06,433 --> 01:02:10,514
and dig trenches in the street
to get a better view.

855
01:02:10,605 --> 01:02:12,893
But I... Hey, speaking
of girl watching,

856
01:02:12,940 --> 01:02:16,938
did you know that our first bachelor
astronaut is on his way to the moon?

857
01:02:17,027 --> 01:02:19,067
Is it Swigert?
Yeah, first bachelor.

858
01:02:19,113 --> 01:02:23,406
He's the kind, they say, has a girl
in every port. He has that reputation.

859
01:02:23,451 --> 01:02:27,828
He's sort of foolishly optimistic,
taking nylons, Hershey bars to the moon.

860
01:02:30,666 --> 01:02:32,576
Did you read
that three million...

861
01:02:32,669 --> 01:02:35,920
What do you say?
Less viewers or fewer viewers?

862
01:02:35,965 --> 01:02:41,005
Three million fewer viewers, uh, watched
the space shot than did the last one.

863
01:02:41,093 --> 01:02:43,846
Uh, I...
Colonel Borman is h...

864
01:02:43,931 --> 01:02:46,420
An ABC New...

865
01:02:46,516 --> 01:02:50,181
Here is ABC science editor
Jules Bergman.

866
01:02:50,270 --> 01:02:53,851
The Apollo 13 spacecraft
has lost all electrical power,

867
01:02:53,940 --> 01:02:56,514
and astronauts Jim Lovell,
Fred Haise and Jack Swigert...

868
01:02:56,609 --> 01:02:59,065
are making their way through
the tunnel to the lunar module,

869
01:02:59,112 --> 01:03:00,690
using it as a lifeboat,

870
01:03:00,781 --> 01:03:03,864
so they'll have electrical power
for their radios on the command module.

871
01:03:03,951 --> 01:03:07,236
Apollo 13 is apparently
also losing breathing oxygen...

872
01:03:07,287 --> 01:03:10,406
Slow down. An electrical failure.
What exactly does that mean?

873
01:03:10,456 --> 01:03:13,458
The emergency has ruled out
any chance of a lunar landing...

874
01:03:13,543 --> 01:03:16,214
and could endanger the lives
of the astronauts themselves...

875
01:03:16,297 --> 01:03:20,376
if the LEM oxygen supply, plus whatever
is left of the command module's oxygen,

876
01:03:20,466 --> 01:03:23,136
can't last them until
they can get back to Earth.

877
01:03:23,219 --> 01:03:25,211
What do you mean there's
no immediate danger?

878
01:03:25,305 --> 01:03:27,761
I just heard they're losing oxygen.
Can they get back?

879
01:03:27,807 --> 01:03:31,590
The LEM's descent rocket engine
will be used in aborting the mission...

880
01:03:31,644 --> 01:03:33,802
and getting the astronauts
safely back to Earth.

881
01:03:33,897 --> 01:03:38,643
Recapping what has happened: The Apollo
13 astronauts may be in grave danger.

882
01:03:38,693 --> 01:03:40,652
No, don't give me
that NASA bullshit!

883
01:03:40,696 --> 01:03:42,854
I want to know what's
happening with my husband!

884
01:03:43,114 --> 01:03:45,273
We want to switch control
to the Aquarius now.

885
01:03:45,325 --> 01:03:47,033
- Roger that.
- Houston, wait!

886
01:03:47,118 --> 01:03:49,989
You're down to
about five minutes now, Jack.

887
01:03:50,079 --> 01:03:55,323
Be aware our R.C.S. Isn't up here yet.
We have no attitude control on Aquarius.

888
01:03:55,377 --> 01:03:58,662
They don't have control?
Did we miss a step here?

889
01:03:58,754 --> 01:04:01,673
- Control, what the hell happened?
- What? I don't know.

890
01:04:06,262 --> 01:04:10,641
We're out of whack. I'm trying to pitch
down, but we're yawing to the left.

891
01:04:10,684 --> 01:04:12,641
Why can't I null this out?

892
01:04:12,687 --> 01:04:15,521
She wasn't designed to fly
attached like this.

893
01:04:15,563 --> 01:04:19,396
It's like flying with
a dead elephant on our back.

894
01:04:19,485 --> 01:04:22,356
Flight, Guidance. We're getting
awfully close to center here.

895
01:04:22,446 --> 01:04:26,194
Watch that middle gimbal. We don't
want you tumbling off into space.

896
01:04:26,242 --> 01:04:28,993
Freddo, inform Houston I'm well aware
of the goddamn gimbals!

897
01:04:29,037 --> 01:04:31,028
Roger that, Houston.

898
01:04:31,079 --> 01:04:33,037
I don't need to hear the obvious.

899
01:04:33,082 --> 01:04:35,158
- I've got the frappin' eight-ball
in front of me!
- Andy, we're on VOX.

900
01:04:35,209 --> 01:04:38,163
Aquarius, this is Houston.
We've got you both on VOX.

901
01:04:38,212 --> 01:04:40,750
You want what?
You want us to go to VOX?

902
01:04:40,839 --> 01:04:43,923
You have a hot mike.
We are reading everything you say.

903
01:04:44,010 --> 01:04:45,919
Sorry, Jim.

904
01:04:47,680 --> 01:04:49,507
It's only
by a very narrow margin...

905
01:04:49,558 --> 01:04:53,720
that we're going to get Lovell,
Haise and Swigert back alive.

906
01:04:53,769 --> 01:04:56,521
Marilyn?

907
01:04:56,564 --> 01:04:59,434
I'm sorry.
Jeffrey's calling for you.

908
01:04:59,526 --> 01:05:03,523
...the terseness of Kraft and
the grim lines of Jim McDivitt.

909
01:05:03,571 --> 01:05:08,279
This has been a very close call.
We're not out of the woods yet.

910
01:05:12,079 --> 01:05:14,536
Jeffrey?

911
01:05:14,582 --> 01:05:17,951
Why are so many people here?

912
01:05:18,044 --> 01:05:23,879
Oh, well, you know...
your dad's flying his mission.

913
01:05:25,927 --> 01:05:29,047
He said he was going
to get me a moon rock.

914
01:05:29,097 --> 01:05:31,967
Right.

915
01:05:32,057 --> 01:05:35,473
Well...

916
01:05:35,561 --> 01:05:40,805
something broke
on your daddy's spaceship,

917
01:05:40,901 --> 01:05:46,487
and he's gonna have to turn around
before he even gets to the moon.

918
01:05:49,410 --> 01:05:52,992
Was it the door?

919
01:05:53,246 --> 01:05:55,998
Thirteen, Houston. We still show
that venting pushing you around.

920
01:05:56,083 --> 01:05:59,118
- How you doing?
- Houston, Aquarius.

921
01:05:59,210 --> 01:06:04,122
We've had to learn how to fly all over
again, but we are doing better now.

922
01:06:04,174 --> 01:06:08,253
- Uh, roger that, Aquarius.
- Have him close it out.

923
01:06:08,303 --> 01:06:11,838
Jack, we can close out
your procedure now.

924
01:06:11,932 --> 01:06:17,009
Do we know for sure that we can
power this thing back up?

925
01:06:17,103 --> 01:06:19,939
It's gonna get
awfully cold in here.

926
01:06:19,982 --> 01:06:24,857
Copy that, Jack.
We'll just have to deal with that later.

927
01:06:27,739 --> 01:06:29,151
- Computer off.
- We're clear.

928
01:06:29,241 --> 01:06:31,280
We're going to the LEM.

929
01:06:33,037 --> 01:06:36,987
We confirm shutdown, Jack.
Lunar module now in control.

930
01:06:41,503 --> 01:06:47,007
Roger that, Houston.
This is Odyssey signing off.

931
01:07:02,774 --> 01:07:05,894
Freddo, we're gonna have
to execute some sort of burn.

932
01:07:05,986 --> 01:07:08,524
It's just a matter of when.

933
01:07:11,699 --> 01:07:15,651
- Did they shut us all down in there?
- Yeah.

934
01:07:15,705 --> 01:07:19,074
Didn't think we'd
be back in here so soon.

935
01:07:19,165 --> 01:07:23,246
Houston, how far off course
do you project we are?

936
01:07:23,337 --> 01:07:25,247
Over.

937
01:07:27,716 --> 01:07:29,626
Okay, people, listen up!

938
01:07:29,719 --> 01:07:33,586
Gentlemen, I want you all
to forget the flight plan.

939
01:07:33,682 --> 01:07:37,631
From this moment on, we are
improvising a new mission.

940
01:07:37,727 --> 01:07:41,595
Sorry about that.

941
01:07:41,690 --> 01:07:43,765
- We'll get somebody to look at that.
- Find a bulb around here.

942
01:07:43,857 --> 01:07:47,642
How do we get our people home?

943
01:07:47,736 --> 01:07:49,646
They are here.

944
01:07:49,740 --> 01:07:52,146
- Do we turn 'em around,
straight back, direct abort?
- Yes!

945
01:07:52,241 --> 01:07:54,199
- Gene...
- I can't guarantee the burn yet.

946
01:07:54,244 --> 01:07:57,495
No, sir, no, sir, no, sir!

947
01:07:57,581 --> 01:07:59,655
We get them on
a free-return trajectory.

948
01:07:59,748 --> 01:08:02,287
It's the option with the fewest
question marks for safety.

949
01:08:02,376 --> 01:08:06,588
I agree with Jerry. We use the moon's
gravity to slingshot them around.

950
01:08:06,673 --> 01:08:09,923
- The LEM will not support three
guys for that amount of time.
- It barely holds two.

951
01:08:10,010 --> 01:08:13,877
We've got to do a direct abort. We do an
about-face, bring the guys right home.

952
01:08:13,930 --> 01:08:16,088
Get 'em back soon.
Absolutely.

953
01:08:16,140 --> 01:08:18,098
We don't even know if
the Odyssey's engine's working.

954
01:08:18,184 --> 01:08:20,093
If there's been serious damage
to this spacecraft...

955
01:08:20,186 --> 01:08:22,096
They blow up and they die!

956
01:08:22,190 --> 01:08:24,181
- That is not the argument!
We are talking about time!
- Jesus! Come on!

957
01:08:24,273 --> 01:08:27,393
I'm not gonna sugarcoat this for you!

958
01:08:27,444 --> 01:08:30,315
Okay, hold it.
Let's hold it down.

959
01:08:30,405 --> 01:08:33,609
Let's hold it down. The only engine
with enough power for a direct abort...

960
01:08:33,700 --> 01:08:36,108
is the S.P.S.
On the service module.

961
01:08:36,203 --> 01:08:38,445
From what Lovell has told us, it could
have been damaged in an explosion,

962
01:08:38,539 --> 01:08:40,446
so let's consider
that engine dead.

963
01:08:40,539 --> 01:08:42,450
We light that thing up,
could blow the whole works.

964
01:08:42,542 --> 01:08:45,080
It's just too risky.
We're not gonna take that chance.

965
01:08:45,128 --> 01:08:47,583
About the only thing the command
module is good for is reentry.

966
01:08:47,630 --> 01:08:51,332
That leaves us with the LEM,
which means free-return trajectory.

967
01:08:51,427 --> 01:08:54,214
Once we get
the guys around the moon,

968
01:08:54,304 --> 01:08:56,629
we'll fire up the LEM engine,
make a long burn,

969
01:08:56,722 --> 01:08:59,179
pick up some speed
and get 'em home as quick as we can.

970
01:08:59,267 --> 01:09:02,968
Gene, I'm wondering what
the Grumman guys think about this.

971
01:09:03,063 --> 01:09:07,440
We can't make any guarantees.
We designed the LEM to land on the moon,

972
01:09:07,484 --> 01:09:09,809
not fire the engine out there
for course corrections.

973
01:09:09,904 --> 01:09:13,948
Well, unfortunately, we're not
landing on the moon, are we?

974
01:09:13,991 --> 01:09:19,033
I don't care what anything was designed
to do. I care about what it can do.

975
01:09:19,580 --> 01:09:23,328
Let's get to work.
Let's lay it out, okay?

976
01:09:24,084 --> 01:09:27,001
CAPCOM. Flight, he says
it will be ready in time.

977
01:09:27,087 --> 01:09:31,167
After this burn, we've got to build
some time in the flight plan for sleep.

978
01:09:31,259 --> 01:09:34,674
- Run it by the F.A.O.
- I've run it by the F.A.O.

979
01:09:34,762 --> 01:09:36,670
Do we know how long
we're gonna fire that burn?

980
01:09:36,763 --> 01:09:40,014
- He specifically wanted
a quote from a flight director.
- Who wanted a quote?

981
01:09:40,101 --> 01:09:42,177
- The President.
- The President?

982
01:09:42,270 --> 01:09:44,843
Nixon. He wants odds.

983
01:09:44,938 --> 01:09:47,180
We are not losing the crew.

984
01:09:47,273 --> 01:09:50,192
I gotta give him odds.
Five to one against?

985
01:09:50,277 --> 01:09:52,186
- Three to one?
- I don't think they're that good.

986
01:09:52,279 --> 01:09:55,315
We are not
losing those men!

987
01:09:58,995 --> 01:10:02,197
How long are they
gonna have to burn the engine?

988
01:10:02,290 --> 01:10:05,788
Look, tell him...
three to one.

989
01:10:08,295 --> 01:10:11,214
Expect loss of signal
in less than one minute.

990
01:10:11,299 --> 01:10:14,882
When we pick you back up we will
have your P.C. Plus two burn data.

991
01:10:14,969 --> 01:10:19,880
Roger that, Houston. We'll hear
from you again at acquisition of signal.

992
01:10:21,642 --> 01:10:23,551
You wanna look?

993
01:10:24,895 --> 01:10:29,189
Oh, look at that.

994
01:10:29,233 --> 01:10:31,190
Wow.

995
01:10:35,156 --> 01:10:40,530
Aquarius, that's 30 seconds
until loss of signal.

996
01:10:42,914 --> 01:10:46,913
Mare Tranquillitatis.

997
01:10:46,960 --> 01:10:50,210
Neil and Buzz's old neighborhood.

998
01:10:50,255 --> 01:10:52,544
Comin' up on Mount Marilyn.

999
01:10:52,591 --> 01:10:56,539
Jim, you gotta
take a look at this.

1000
01:10:56,594 --> 01:10:58,920
I've seen it.

1001
01:11:04,436 --> 01:11:06,394
Aquarius, this is Houston.

1002
01:11:06,438 --> 01:11:11,395
We expect loss of signal
in approximately ten seconds.

1003
01:11:11,442 --> 01:11:14,610
So long, Earth.
Catch you on the flip side.

1004
01:11:21,452 --> 01:11:24,738
When you go
into the shadow of the moon...

1005
01:11:24,789 --> 01:11:27,246
and the moon is
between you and the sun,

1006
01:11:27,292 --> 01:11:30,993
you see stars that are more brilliant
than anything you've ever seen...

1007
01:11:31,088 --> 01:11:33,164
on the clearest nights
here on Earth.

1008
01:11:33,257 --> 01:11:38,843
And then you pass into the lunar sunrise
over the lunar surface.

1009
01:11:38,929 --> 01:11:41,170
It must be an awe-inspiring sight.

1010
01:11:41,265 --> 01:11:43,969
I-I-I can't wait to see it myself.

1011
01:11:44,059 --> 01:11:48,352
The problem now is not so much
a question of an adequate oxygen supply,

1012
01:11:48,438 --> 01:11:50,432
but it is the rate
of consumption of water,

1013
01:11:50,483 --> 01:11:53,684
which is vitally needed
for the cooling operations...

1014
01:11:53,777 --> 01:11:56,233
to maintain the electronic systems
and so forth.

1015
01:12:34,234 --> 01:12:37,521
Look, it's Fra Mauro.

1016
01:12:37,572 --> 01:12:40,323
I can see our landing site.

1017
01:12:42,075 --> 01:12:44,068
Wow.

1018
01:12:44,162 --> 01:12:48,408
Look at the Tsiolkovskii crater.

1019
01:12:48,499 --> 01:12:52,877
I can't believe how bright
the ejecta blanket is.

1020
01:12:52,920 --> 01:12:56,537
It's like snow. It's beautiful.

1021
01:12:56,589 --> 01:12:59,758
That's Mare Imbrium to the north.

1022
01:14:02,948 --> 01:14:04,907
Thirteen, this is Houston.

1023
01:14:04,951 --> 01:14:08,948
We're reading your telemetry.
It's good to see you again.

1024
01:14:09,039 --> 01:14:11,495
Good to see you too, Houston.

1025
01:14:11,584 --> 01:14:15,166
We are picking you up at a velocity
of 7,062 feet per second...

1026
01:14:15,254 --> 01:14:19,548
at a distance from the moon
of 56 nautical miles.

1027
01:14:19,633 --> 01:14:22,836
Stand by for your
P.C. Plus two burn data.

1028
01:14:22,928 --> 01:14:28,348
I had an itch to take this baby down,
do some prospectin'.

1029
01:14:28,433 --> 01:14:31,803
Damn, we were close.

1030
01:14:33,563 --> 01:14:36,648
Gentlemen,
what are your intentions?

1031
01:14:40,072 --> 01:14:42,476
I'd like to go home.

1032
01:14:44,575 --> 01:14:46,983
We got a burn coming up.

1033
01:14:47,077 --> 01:14:49,994
We're gonna need a contingency
if we lose comm with Houston.

1034
01:14:50,080 --> 01:14:54,623
Freddo, let's get an idea where
we stand on the consumables.

1035
01:14:54,667 --> 01:14:56,624
Jack, get into the Odyssey...

1036
01:14:56,669 --> 01:14:59,920
and bag up all the water you can
before it freezes in there.

1037
01:15:03,135 --> 01:15:05,044
Let's go home.

1038
01:15:05,137 --> 01:15:08,387
Aquarius, we got some P.C.
Plus two burn data for you fellas.

1039
01:15:08,933 --> 01:15:13,843
So you're telling me you can
only give our guys 45 hours?

1040
01:15:13,896 --> 01:15:17,846
That brings them to about there.

1041
01:15:20,611 --> 01:15:22,686
Gentlemen, that's not acceptable.

1042
01:15:22,737 --> 01:15:26,189
Gene, Gene, we've got
to talk about power.

1043
01:15:26,283 --> 01:15:29,319
Whoa, whoa, guys!
Power is everything!

1044
01:15:29,369 --> 01:15:31,826
- Power is everything.
- What do you mean?

1045
01:15:31,873 --> 01:15:34,992
Without it, they don't talk to us,
they don't correct their trajectory,

1046
01:15:35,042 --> 01:15:36,999
they don't turn
the heat shield around.

1047
01:15:37,043 --> 01:15:41,873
We gotta turn everything off, now.
They're not gonna make it to reentry.

1048
01:15:41,925 --> 01:15:45,375
- What do you mean, "everything"?
- With everything on,
the LEM draws 60 amps.

1049
01:15:45,469 --> 01:15:49,846
At that rate, in 16 hours
the batteries are dead, not 45.

1050
01:15:49,890 --> 01:15:52,382
And so is the crew.
We gotta get them down to 12 amps.

1051
01:15:52,477 --> 01:15:54,433
- Twelve amps?
- How many?

1052
01:15:54,520 --> 01:15:56,846
You can't run a vacuum cleaner
on 12 amps, John.

1053
01:15:56,898 --> 01:16:00,517
We gotta turn off... We have to
turn off the radars, cabin heater,

1054
01:16:00,569 --> 01:16:02,856
instrument displays,
the guidance computer, the whole smash.

1055
01:16:02,902 --> 01:16:05,690
Whoa! Guidance computer.
What if they need to do another burn?

1056
01:16:05,740 --> 01:16:08,362
They won't even know
which way they're pointed.

1057
01:16:08,410 --> 01:16:11,196
The more time we talk,
the more juice they waste.

1058
01:16:11,245 --> 01:16:14,034
- That's the deal?
- That's the deal.

1059
01:16:18,586 --> 01:16:23,581
Okay, John. The minute we finish
the burn, we'll power down the LEM.

1060
01:16:23,674 --> 01:16:25,715
All right.

1061
01:16:25,760 --> 01:16:30,138
Now in the meantime, we're gonna have
a frozen command module up there.

1062
01:16:30,223 --> 01:16:33,473
We're gonna have to power it up using
nothing but the reentry batteries.

1063
01:16:33,559 --> 01:16:37,392
- That's never been tried.
- We've never even simulated it before.

1064
01:16:37,439 --> 01:16:39,645
Well, we're gonna
have to figure it out.

1065
01:16:39,733 --> 01:16:43,433
I want people in our simulators
working reentry scenarios.

1066
01:16:43,527 --> 01:16:47,312
I want you to find every engineer who
designed every switch, every circuit,

1067
01:16:47,407 --> 01:16:49,281
and every light bulb
that's up there.

1068
01:16:49,367 --> 01:16:52,737
Then talk to the guy in the assembly
line who actually built the thing.

1069
01:16:52,788 --> 01:16:56,489
Find out how to squeeze every amp
out of both of these goddamn machines.

1070
01:16:56,583 --> 01:17:01,826
I want this mark all the way
back to Earth with time to spare.

1071
01:17:01,922 --> 01:17:03,831
We never lost
an American in space.

1072
01:17:03,924 --> 01:17:06,331
We're sure as hell not
gonna lose one on my watch.

1073
01:17:06,426 --> 01:17:08,336
Failure is not an option.

1074
01:17:14,100 --> 01:17:16,010
Ken?

1075
01:17:16,103 --> 01:17:17,301
Ken?

1076
01:17:17,396 --> 01:17:20,315
- What? Huh?
- Good, you're not dead.

1077
01:17:20,400 --> 01:17:23,185
I've been trying to get in touch
with you for 45 minutes.

1078
01:17:23,275 --> 01:17:25,269
Jesus, John,
what are you doing here?

1079
01:17:25,362 --> 01:17:27,271
I gotta get you in the simulators.
We got a ship to land.

1080
01:17:27,364 --> 01:17:29,606
- What?
- There's been an explosion.

1081
01:17:29,657 --> 01:17:32,944
Oxygen tanks are gone. Two fuel cells
gone. Command module shut down.

1082
01:17:33,037 --> 01:17:35,953
- What about the crew?
- Crew's fine so far.

1083
01:17:36,040 --> 01:17:38,115
Trying to keep them
alive in the LEM.

1084
01:17:38,208 --> 01:17:41,126
We're gonna have to shut
that down pretty soon too.

1085
01:17:41,212 --> 01:17:44,297
We got a lot of people working
the numbers on this one, Ken.

1086
01:17:44,382 --> 01:17:47,133
Nobody's too sure how much power
we're gonna have when we hit reentry.

1087
01:17:47,218 --> 01:17:50,135
The command module's gonna be
frozen up pretty good by then.

1088
01:17:50,220 --> 01:17:54,966
You see this ammeter rise over 20
at any point, power-up is no good.

1089
01:17:55,058 --> 01:17:57,301
We see it spike, that's sayonara
for the guidance computer.

1090
01:17:57,394 --> 01:17:59,471
Our guys can't reenter. Okay?

1091
01:17:59,563 --> 01:18:01,473
How much power do we have
to play with?

1092
01:18:01,565 --> 01:18:03,806
Barely enough to run this
coffee pot for nine hours.

1093
01:18:03,900 --> 01:18:06,143
- Go.
- Yeah, Ken Mattingly just got here.

1094
01:18:06,236 --> 01:18:08,907
Copy. He's here.

1095
01:18:08,990 --> 01:18:11,148
They've been losing heat
since the accident.

1096
01:18:11,241 --> 01:18:13,994
They're gonna start getting water
condensation on the control panels.

1097
01:18:14,036 --> 01:18:17,322
- Ken, glad you're here.
You know what's going on?
- John's brought me up to speed.

1098
01:18:17,414 --> 01:18:19,656
- What do we have left in the batteries?
- We don't really know.

1099
01:18:19,750 --> 01:18:21,992
We gotta get started on
some shortcuts for power-up.

1100
01:18:22,086 --> 01:18:23,496
You know how short?

1101
01:18:23,588 --> 01:18:27,336
It's all in the sequencing. If we can
skip whatever we don't absolutely need,

1102
01:18:27,425 --> 01:18:30,295
- turn things on in the right order...
- I agree.

1103
01:18:30,344 --> 01:18:33,796
- You started on a procedure?
- The engineers have tried,
but it's your ship.

1104
01:18:33,848 --> 01:18:36,719
- We gotta get you in there.
- Okay.

1105
01:18:36,809 --> 01:18:39,479
Frank, I need the sim
cold and dark.

1106
01:18:39,520 --> 01:18:41,976
Give me the exact same conditions
they've got in there now.

1107
01:18:42,023 --> 01:18:44,644
- I need present status
of every instrument.
- You got it.

1108
01:18:44,692 --> 01:18:47,978
I need a flashlight.
That's not what they have up there.

1109
01:18:48,029 --> 01:18:50,152
Don't give me anything
they don't have on board.

1110
01:18:50,198 --> 01:18:52,523
Let's get this show on the road.
Put him in space, fellas.

1111
01:18:54,703 --> 01:18:57,656
Okay, Houston, the quad heater
circuit breakers are open.

1112
01:18:57,705 --> 01:18:59,662
Copy that.

1113
01:18:59,707 --> 01:19:02,495
We're using the forward omni
when the earth's in the window,

1114
01:19:02,543 --> 01:19:05,331
and we're switching to aft omni
when we see the moon.

1115
01:19:05,381 --> 01:19:07,337
We copy that, Thirteen.

1116
01:19:07,382 --> 01:19:10,003
Aquarius, we don't want you
to make any more waste dumps.

1117
01:19:10,050 --> 01:19:12,838
The venting may
push you off course.

1118
01:19:12,888 --> 01:19:16,007
- Oh, Christ.
- What's up?

1119
01:19:16,057 --> 01:19:20,352
No more waste dumps.
We're just gonna have to store it.

1120
01:19:20,395 --> 01:19:22,388
Jack, we're gonna need
some more urine bags.

1121
01:19:22,439 --> 01:19:27,065
Okay, Houston, that leaves us
with just the computer,

1122
01:19:27,110 --> 01:19:31,937
which I'm shutting down now.

1123
01:19:36,745 --> 01:19:38,702
And that's it.

1124
01:19:38,746 --> 01:19:41,950
We just put Sir Isaac Newton
in the driver's seat.

1125
01:19:47,256 --> 01:19:49,544
Is it A.M. Or P.M.?

1126
01:19:49,591 --> 01:19:53,043
A.M. Very, very A.M.

1127
01:19:53,096 --> 01:19:55,715
Haise is running a temperature,
and none of them has slept.

1128
01:19:55,763 --> 01:19:59,181
I can't order these guys to go to sleep.
Could you sleep up there?

1129
01:19:59,268 --> 01:20:01,475
It's gonna get awful cold
in there for those guys.

1130
01:20:03,438 --> 01:20:07,567
Gene, we have a situation
brewing with the carbon dioxide.

1131
01:20:07,609 --> 01:20:09,982
We got a CO2 filter problem
on the lunar module.

1132
01:20:10,070 --> 01:20:13,571
- Five filters on the LEM.
- Meant for 2 guys for a day and a half.

1133
01:20:13,616 --> 01:20:16,072
- I told the doc...
- They're already up to 8 on the gauges.

1134
01:20:16,119 --> 01:20:19,320
Anything over 15 and you get
impaired judgment, blackouts,

1135
01:20:19,413 --> 01:20:22,864
- beginnings of brain asphyxia.
- What about the scrubbers
on the command module?

1136
01:20:22,958 --> 01:20:25,285
- They take square cartridges.
- The ones on the LEM are round.

1137
01:20:27,463 --> 01:20:30,215
Tell me this isn't
a government operation.

1138
01:20:30,299 --> 01:20:32,968
This just isn't a contingency
we've remotely looked at.

1139
01:20:33,011 --> 01:20:35,167
Those CO2 levels
are gonna be getting toxic.

1140
01:20:35,262 --> 01:20:40,506
I suggest you invent a way to put
a square peg in a round hole rapidly.

1141
01:20:43,270 --> 01:20:46,520
Okay, people, listen up.

1142
01:20:46,607 --> 01:20:50,687
The people upstairs have handed us
this one, and we gotta come through.

1143
01:20:50,778 --> 01:20:54,858
We gotta find a way
to make this...

1144
01:20:54,950 --> 01:20:57,701
fit into the hole for this...

1145
01:20:57,785 --> 01:21:00,357
using nothing but that.

1146
01:21:01,914 --> 01:21:04,535
- Let's get it organized.
- Okay, let's build a filter.

1147
01:21:04,626 --> 01:21:07,662
Better get some coffee
going too, someone.

1148
01:21:08,296 --> 01:21:10,537
The Haise family
lives in El Lago, Texas.

1149
01:21:10,631 --> 01:21:13,383
His wife, Mary,
is from Biloxi, Mississippi.

1150
01:21:13,469 --> 01:21:15,376
When Fred Haise
was growing up in Biloxi,

1151
01:21:15,469 --> 01:21:17,546
he may have looked
ahead to a fine family,

1152
01:21:17,639 --> 01:21:19,547
but he never dreamt of flying.

1153
01:21:19,641 --> 01:21:22,050
I'd never flown really
before I went into the service,

1154
01:21:22,144 --> 01:21:26,436
and I only went into the flying business
as a means to getting a commission.

1155
01:21:26,523 --> 01:21:29,524
- Good morning.
- Henry. Don't you ever sleep?

1156
01:21:29,568 --> 01:21:33,696
- I have a request from the news people.
- Uh-huh.

1157
01:21:33,780 --> 01:21:36,353
They want to put
a transmitter up on the lawn.

1158
01:21:38,409 --> 01:21:40,366
Transmitter?

1159
01:21:40,411 --> 01:21:43,033
It's kind of a tower
for a live broadcast.

1160
01:21:47,919 --> 01:21:52,628
They didn't care about this mission.
They didn't even run Jim's show.

1161
01:21:52,715 --> 01:21:57,128
Well... it's more dramatic now.
Suddenly people are...

1162
01:21:57,219 --> 01:22:00,720
Landing on the moon
wasn't dramatic enough for them.
Why should not landing be?

1163
01:22:00,765 --> 01:22:05,059
Look, I, um, realize
how hard this is, Marilyn,

1164
01:22:05,102 --> 01:22:07,225
but the whole world
is caught up in it.

1165
01:22:07,272 --> 01:22:09,977
- It's the biggest story since...
- No, Henry.

1166
01:22:10,067 --> 01:22:14,895
Those people don't put one piece
of equipment on my lawn.

1167
01:22:14,947 --> 01:22:18,730
If they have a problem with that,
they can take it up with my husband.

1168
01:22:18,783 --> 01:22:21,238
He'll be home on Friday.

1169
01:22:28,752 --> 01:22:32,334
When you are sad and Ionely

1170
01:22:32,422 --> 01:22:36,004
And have no place to go

1171
01:22:36,093 --> 01:22:41,515
Come to see me, baby
and bring along some dough

1172
01:22:41,599 --> 01:22:47,138
And we'll go honky tonkin'
Honky tonkin'

1173
01:22:47,229 --> 01:22:51,522
Honky tonkin', honey baby

1174
01:22:51,608 --> 01:22:56,851
We'll go honky tonkin'
'round this town

1175
01:23:04,955 --> 01:23:06,865
Hey, Freddo.

1176
01:23:06,957 --> 01:23:11,001
It's too cold in there.

1177
01:23:11,086 --> 01:23:14,207
Yeah.

1178
01:23:23,932 --> 01:23:26,554
That's a nice one of Mary.

1179
01:23:29,396 --> 01:23:32,682
- You don't look too good, Freddo.
- I'll survive.

1180
01:23:32,775 --> 01:23:35,646
- There's aspirin in the medical kit.
- I took some.

1181
01:23:35,737 --> 01:23:37,979
Jim, I'm all right.

1182
01:23:42,576 --> 01:23:46,658
It was an accident,
Mary gettin' pregnant.

1183
01:23:46,748 --> 01:23:51,824
You should have seen the look
on my face when she told me.

1184
01:23:51,919 --> 01:23:55,004
Well, that has
a tendency to happen.

1185
01:23:55,048 --> 01:23:58,168
Yeah.

1186
01:24:02,765 --> 01:24:04,886
I wonder if it's
a boy or a girl.

1187
01:24:06,976 --> 01:24:08,933
You're gonna find out
soon enough.

1188
01:24:09,020 --> 01:24:11,855
Sure.

1189
01:24:14,943 --> 01:24:18,193
I never dreamed I'd ever get
to do something like this:

1190
01:24:18,238 --> 01:24:20,775
Come up here on a real mission.

1191
01:24:20,864 --> 01:24:24,531
Most of the guys
I graduated high school with...

1192
01:24:24,619 --> 01:24:27,111
never even left home,
and here I am.

1193
01:24:27,206 --> 01:24:32,412
Oh, yeah... here you are.

1194
01:24:35,713 --> 01:24:38,384
It hurts when I urinate.

1195
01:24:38,467 --> 01:24:41,551
Well, you're not
gettin' enough water.

1196
01:24:41,636 --> 01:24:46,512
I'm drinking my ration
the same as you.

1197
01:24:46,558 --> 01:24:50,853
I think old Swigert
gave me the clap.

1198
01:24:50,896 --> 01:24:55,854
He's been pissin' in my relief tube.

1199
01:24:55,901 --> 01:25:00,858
Well... that will be a hot one at
the debriefing for the flight surgeon.

1200
01:25:00,905 --> 01:25:06,696
That's another first
for America's space program.

1201
01:25:06,746 --> 01:25:08,369
Listen, um... I've been
going... over some stuff,

1202
01:25:12,459 --> 01:25:18,248
and I'm a little worried about this cold
affecting our battery efficiency.

1203
01:25:18,341 --> 01:25:22,553
We quit heatin' the glycol to save
water and power, so that's not helping.

1204
01:25:22,595 --> 01:25:24,550
It could cost us
amp hours on the back end?

1205
01:25:24,595 --> 01:25:27,432
- That's a possibility.
- I've been goin' over the numbers again.

1206
01:25:27,516 --> 01:25:30,601
Have they called up
with a reentry plan yet?

1207
01:25:30,645 --> 01:25:33,313
- We're comin' in too shallow and fast.
- We're workin' on something. Hold on.

1208
01:25:33,396 --> 01:25:35,307
I can't remember
the ratio to temperature.

1209
01:25:35,399 --> 01:25:37,308
We got no references on board.

1210
01:25:37,402 --> 01:25:39,310
Let's see if Houston
can pull up the mill specs.

1211
01:25:39,403 --> 01:25:43,353
Listen, listen! They gave us too much
Delta V. They had us burn too long.

1212
01:25:43,448 --> 01:25:46,653
At this rate we're gonna skip
right out of the atmosphere,
and we're never gonna get back.

1213
01:25:46,744 --> 01:25:50,112
What are you talkin' about?
How'd you figure that?

1214
01:25:50,206 --> 01:25:51,949
I can add.

1215
01:25:54,084 --> 01:25:57,618
- They've got half the Ph.D. S
on the planet working on this.
- Houston says we're on the money.

1216
01:25:57,713 --> 01:25:59,836
What if they made a mistake and
there was no way to reverse it?

1217
01:25:59,924 --> 01:26:01,798
Do you think they would tell us?

1218
01:26:01,843 --> 01:26:05,293
- There's no reason to tell us.
- What do you mean? That's bullshit!

1219
01:26:05,344 --> 01:26:07,836
There's a thousand things
that have to happen in order.

1220
01:26:07,932 --> 01:26:13,008
We are on number eight.
You're talking about number 692.

1221
01:26:13,103 --> 01:26:16,188
In the meantime, I'm trying to
tell you we're coming in too fast.

1222
01:26:16,274 --> 01:26:19,358
I think they know it, and that's why
we don't have a goddamn reentry plan.

1223
01:26:19,443 --> 01:26:21,483
That's duly noted.
Thank you, Jack.

1224
01:26:21,570 --> 01:26:24,144
Ow!

1225
01:26:24,198 --> 01:26:26,155
- Goddamn this piece of shit!
- Hey!

1226
01:26:26,201 --> 01:26:28,489
- This piece of shit's
gonna get you home.
- All right.

1227
01:26:28,536 --> 01:26:32,236
That's because that's
the only thing we got left, Jack!

1228
01:26:32,331 --> 01:26:36,827
- What are you saying, Fred?
- I think you know what I'm saying.

1229
01:26:36,877 --> 01:26:40,578
Now wait a minute.
All I did was stir those tanks.

1230
01:26:40,674 --> 01:26:42,583
What was that gauge reading
before you hit the switch?

1231
01:26:42,676 --> 01:26:44,667
- Don't tell me how to fly the damn C.M.!
- You don't know, do you?

1232
01:26:44,718 --> 01:26:46,177
They brought me in to do a job!

1233
01:26:46,220 --> 01:26:48,676
They asked me to stir the tanks,
and I stirred the tanks!

1234
01:26:48,765 --> 01:26:52,679
- Stop kicking yourself in the ass.
- This is not my fault!

1235
01:26:52,726 --> 01:26:54,684
No one is saying it is.

1236
01:26:54,729 --> 01:26:57,850
If I'm in the left-hand seat when
the call comes up, I stir the tanks.

1237
01:26:57,941 --> 01:26:59,435
Yeah, well, tell him that.

1238
01:26:59,526 --> 01:27:02,729
I just asked you what the gauge
was readin', and you don't know!

1239
01:27:02,821 --> 01:27:04,813
Look, we're not doing this.
We are not gonna do this.

1240
01:27:04,864 --> 01:27:07,356
We're not gonna go bouncing
off the walls for ten minutes...

1241
01:27:07,409 --> 01:27:10,362
because we're just gonna end up right
back here with the same problems!

1242
01:27:10,411 --> 01:27:13,531
Try to figure out
how to stay alive!

1243
01:27:14,165 --> 01:27:16,075
Aquarius, this is Houston.

1244
01:27:16,167 --> 01:27:18,955
- Are we on VOX?
- No, we're not on VOX.

1245
01:27:19,045 --> 01:27:21,583
Yeah, Houston, this is Aquarius.
Go ahead.

1246
01:27:21,673 --> 01:27:27,378
Yeah, Jim, could you check
your CO2 gauge for us?

1247
01:27:29,013 --> 01:27:31,587
Yeah, Houston,
we were just looking at that.

1248
01:27:31,684 --> 01:27:35,598
Our CO2 measurement has jumped
four notches in the last hour.

1249
01:27:35,687 --> 01:27:38,557
That can't be right.
I went over those numbers three times.

1250
01:27:38,648 --> 01:27:42,480
Jim, that sounds about right.
We were expecting that.

1251
01:27:42,568 --> 01:27:45,819
That's very comforting, Houston.
What do we do about it?

1252
01:27:45,906 --> 01:27:50,485
We're working on a procedure
down here for you.

1253
01:27:50,577 --> 01:27:52,985
- Do you copy?
- Oh, Christ.

1254
01:27:53,079 --> 01:27:55,156
All right, Houston, we're
standing by for those procedures.

1255
01:27:55,249 --> 01:27:58,498
Christ, I know why
my numbers are wrong.

1256
01:27:58,585 --> 01:28:01,337
I only figured it
for two people.

1257
01:28:04,758 --> 01:28:08,507
Maybe I should just
hold my breath.

1258
01:28:08,595 --> 01:28:13,340
The deadly CO2 gas is poisoning the
astronauts with every breath in and out.

1259
01:28:13,433 --> 01:28:16,435
Heads up. Heads up.

1260
01:28:16,520 --> 01:28:20,020
- Oh! Go, go, go, go!
- Someone get that. Damn.

1261
01:28:20,107 --> 01:28:22,063
Heads up, people.
Look out now.

1262
01:28:25,279 --> 01:28:28,778
- What's this?
- That's what they gotta make.

1263
01:28:28,866 --> 01:28:32,281
- I hope you got the procedures for me.
- Right here.

1264
01:28:32,369 --> 01:28:34,279
That's it?

1265
01:28:36,207 --> 01:28:38,115
All right, Aquarius, this is Houston.

1266
01:28:38,208 --> 01:28:40,119
Do you have a flight plan?

1267
01:28:40,211 --> 01:28:43,296
Affirmative, Andy.
Jack's got one right here.

1268
01:28:43,381 --> 01:28:47,294
Okay, we have an unusual
procedure for you here.

1269
01:28:47,343 --> 01:28:49,300
We need you
to rip the cover off.

1270
01:28:49,345 --> 01:28:51,801
He wants you to rip the cover
off the flight plan.

1271
01:28:51,890 --> 01:28:55,008
With pleasure.

1272
01:28:55,101 --> 01:28:57,390
The other materials
you're gonna need here are...

1273
01:28:57,478 --> 01:28:59,388
- a lithium hydroxide canister...
- Two, two.

1274
01:28:59,480 --> 01:29:01,638
Two lithium hydroxide canisters.
I'm sorry.

1275
01:29:01,732 --> 01:29:04,188
- A roll of gray tape.
- Duct tape.

1276
01:29:04,277 --> 01:29:09,353
Duct tape. You need an L.C.G. Bag...
Two L.C.G. Bags.

1277
01:29:09,448 --> 01:29:12,983
The red suit hoses,
and you've got the flight plan cover.

1278
01:29:15,079 --> 01:29:17,996
- Can you give me a timetable?
- Henry! Henry!

1279
01:29:18,040 --> 01:29:20,199
What about their level
of carbon dioxide?

1280
01:29:20,294 --> 01:29:22,499
It's, uh, climbing.

1281
01:29:22,587 --> 01:29:26,204
You're saying that they're
almost out of breathable air?

1282
01:29:26,298 --> 01:29:31,007
Wait a second. That's not what he said.
He said we're working on it.

1283
01:29:31,053 --> 01:29:34,719
You want to cut
the duct tape three feet long.

1284
01:29:34,807 --> 01:29:36,931
- Tell him to use his arm.
- Just use your arm.

1285
01:29:37,019 --> 01:29:39,853
- It's a good arm length.
- I see what you're getting at. Hold on.

1286
01:29:39,938 --> 01:29:43,021
Jack, tear that piece of tape
down the middle lengthwise.

1287
01:29:43,107 --> 01:29:45,515
- All right?
- Hold on, Houston.

1288
01:29:47,237 --> 01:29:50,356
While the astronauts appear to have
enough oxygen to keep them alive,

1289
01:29:50,448 --> 01:29:53,698
one thing they have too much of
is carbon dioxide.

1290
01:29:53,784 --> 01:29:55,694
With each breath,
the three men expel...

1291
01:29:55,788 --> 01:29:59,036
more of the poisonous gas
into the lunar module cockpit,

1292
01:29:59,123 --> 01:30:01,959
and the scrubbers intended to
keep the atmosphere breathable...

1293
01:30:02,043 --> 01:30:03,954
are quickly becoming saturated.

1294
01:30:06,213 --> 01:30:08,373
Oh, shit. I tore it.

1295
01:30:08,425 --> 01:30:11,759
Shit!

1296
01:30:11,845 --> 01:30:16,258
Houston, what do we do if we
ripped the bag? Can we tape it?

1297
01:30:16,350 --> 01:30:18,389
- They just tore the bag.
- Oh, no.

1298
01:30:18,477 --> 01:30:20,553
Uh, stand by.
What should I tell 'em to do?

1299
01:30:20,646 --> 01:30:22,472
They should have one more.

1300
01:30:22,563 --> 01:30:25,234
But they've still got
a long way to come.

1301
01:30:25,317 --> 01:30:30,026
They are now working on their backup
facilities, their emergency facilities.

1302
01:30:30,071 --> 01:30:34,449
The problem is, if anything more
goes wrong, they're in real trouble.

1303
01:31:03,354 --> 01:31:07,400
As most of you are aware, there is
no rescue possible in space flight.

1304
01:31:07,443 --> 01:31:10,397
A-Any rescue system the space agency
has long since calculated...

1305
01:31:10,446 --> 01:31:12,404
Hold this a minute.

1306
01:31:12,448 --> 01:31:15,733
Since any rescue system
the space agency calculated...

1307
01:31:20,498 --> 01:31:23,249
- One sock.
- Once you have the sock in place,

1308
01:31:23,292 --> 01:31:25,962
- we're gonna want you to bungee...
- Work it in.

1309
01:31:26,044 --> 01:31:28,333
The entire filter assembly
to the bulkhead,

1310
01:31:28,422 --> 01:31:32,006
- right above the LEM canister.
- We're getting close to 15.

1311
01:31:32,093 --> 01:31:36,839
So how does this flight compare to other
emergency situations you've faced?

1312
01:31:36,931 --> 01:31:41,509
I'd have to say that this is
the most serious situation...

1313
01:31:41,601 --> 01:31:44,389
we've ever encountered
in manned space flight.

1314
01:31:44,481 --> 01:31:48,526
- Houston, filter's in place.
- Cabin gas return to egress.

1315
01:31:48,610 --> 01:31:50,851
Suit circuit relief to close.

1316
01:31:50,945 --> 01:31:55,358
- CO2 canister select to secondary.
- All right.

1317
01:31:55,449 --> 01:31:58,533
Here goes.

1318
01:31:58,619 --> 01:32:01,573
I can hear air moving.

1319
01:32:12,801 --> 01:32:15,421
Just breathe normal, fellas.

1320
01:32:17,514 --> 01:32:21,382
Aquarius, please advise on CO2 status.

1321
01:32:21,476 --> 01:32:24,477
Yeah, Houston, we're taking
a look at those numbers now.

1322
01:32:27,232 --> 01:32:30,517
We're still holding
close to 15, Houston.

1323
01:32:30,610 --> 01:32:32,936
Roger that. Standing by.

1324
01:32:44,083 --> 01:32:48,708
Houston, the CO2 level
has dropped to nine...

1325
01:32:48,753 --> 01:32:52,538
and it is still falling.

1326
01:32:52,633 --> 01:32:55,549
- Yes!
- Great. Good job, you guys.

1327
01:32:55,593 --> 01:32:58,216
That is good to hear, Aquarius.

1328
01:32:58,264 --> 01:33:02,046
And you, sir,
are a steely-eyed missile man.

1329
01:33:05,479 --> 01:33:07,721
Okay, spacecraft control to computer.

1330
01:33:07,773 --> 01:33:10,442
Damn!

1331
01:33:13,611 --> 01:33:15,568
Damn.

1332
01:33:15,613 --> 01:33:17,820
We overloaded.

1333
01:33:17,908 --> 01:33:19,816
We used way too much power.

1334
01:33:19,909 --> 01:33:23,742
There must be a sneak circuit
between step seven and ten.

1335
01:33:23,789 --> 01:33:29,329
- Which one has the leak?
- Don't know that yet, John.

1336
01:33:29,419 --> 01:33:32,420
The sequence was wrong. We just have to
go back and try 'em one at a time.

1337
01:33:32,505 --> 01:33:35,673
You need a break, Ken?

1338
01:33:35,759 --> 01:33:38,761
If they don't get one,
I don't get one.

1339
01:33:42,933 --> 01:33:45,507
Well, if it won't work,
get me another one.

1340
01:33:45,602 --> 01:33:48,853
- My son's supposed to be on.
- I know, Mrs. Lovell.

1341
01:33:48,941 --> 01:33:54,016
- Hi, Blanch.
- They can't fix a thing in this place.

1342
01:33:54,111 --> 01:33:57,029
Blanch, it's Marilyn.

1343
01:33:57,115 --> 01:33:59,189
Hi, Grandma.

1344
01:33:59,283 --> 01:34:04,443
- I was gonna see Jimmy.
- I know. I know.

1345
01:34:04,497 --> 01:34:08,540
We came to tell you something.

1346
01:34:08,625 --> 01:34:13,537
There's been an accident.
Jimmy's okay. He's all right.

1347
01:34:13,632 --> 01:34:17,960
But he's not gonna get
to walk on the moon.

1348
01:34:18,053 --> 01:34:21,338
Well, they said he was.

1349
01:34:21,431 --> 01:34:23,387
I know. I know.

1350
01:34:23,473 --> 01:34:27,638
Um... that was before.

1351
01:34:27,728 --> 01:34:31,477
Now there's been an explosion,
and they're all okay.

1352
01:34:31,524 --> 01:34:35,735
They're all right.
But now they're just going to...

1353
01:34:35,820 --> 01:34:39,403
try to figure out
a way to get them home.

1354
01:34:39,490 --> 01:34:44,996
And...

1355
01:34:45,080 --> 01:34:48,993
And it's a little bit dangerous.

1356
01:34:49,083 --> 01:34:52,416
Oh, sweetie.

1357
01:34:54,422 --> 01:34:56,664
Are you scared?

1358
01:35:00,053 --> 01:35:03,503
Well, don't you worry, honey.

1359
01:35:03,597 --> 01:35:08,176
If they could get
a washing machine to fly,

1360
01:35:08,270 --> 01:35:11,519
my Jimmy could land it.

1361
01:35:13,150 --> 01:35:18,855
You saw me standing alone

1362
01:35:22,617 --> 01:35:28,322
Without a dream in my heart

1363
01:35:30,792 --> 01:35:37,294
Without a love of my own

1364
01:35:49,562 --> 01:35:54,022
Jack, you'll be happy to hear
we contacted President Nixon,

1365
01:35:54,066 --> 01:35:57,685
and he's gonna grant you
an extension on your income taxes...

1366
01:35:57,736 --> 01:36:02,694
since you are most decidedly
out of the country.

1367
01:36:02,741 --> 01:36:05,364
Roger that, Houston.

1368
01:36:05,412 --> 01:36:08,245
That's wonderful news.

1369
01:36:08,287 --> 01:36:10,577
Tell them they have to sleep.

1370
01:36:10,624 --> 01:36:12,913
Haise is running a fever of 104.

1371
01:36:13,001 --> 01:36:16,619
Thirteen, we've had another
request from the flight surgeon...

1372
01:36:16,714 --> 01:36:18,623
that you fellas get more sleep.

1373
01:36:18,716 --> 01:36:21,882
He doesn't like
his readings down here.

1374
01:36:21,927 --> 01:36:24,049
Let's see how
he feels about this.

1375
01:36:24,095 --> 01:36:27,346
I am sick and tired
of the entire western world...

1376
01:36:27,433 --> 01:36:32,771
knowing how my kidneys
are functioning!

1377
01:36:32,813 --> 01:36:37,142
Flight, I just lost Lovell!

1378
01:36:41,781 --> 01:36:44,451
Uh, Thirteen, this is Houston.

1379
01:36:44,534 --> 01:36:48,115
Jim, we just had a dropout
on your bio-med sensors.

1380
01:36:48,161 --> 01:36:52,325
I'm not wearing
my bio-med sensors, Houston.

1381
01:37:01,425 --> 01:37:05,173
Okay, Jim. Copy that.

1382
01:37:19,110 --> 01:37:23,155
Now I'm losing all three of 'em!

1383
01:37:23,239 --> 01:37:25,862
It's just a little
medical mutiny, Doc.

1384
01:37:25,951 --> 01:37:28,072
I'm sure the guys
are still with us.

1385
01:37:28,159 --> 01:37:31,328
Let's cut 'em
some slack, okay?

1386
01:37:43,051 --> 01:37:47,179
It's not the velocity,
it's the angle.

1387
01:37:47,222 --> 01:37:50,841
Maybe they're still venting something
that's throwing off the trajectory,

1388
01:37:50,893 --> 01:37:52,849
but we are definitely
shallowing again.

1389
01:37:52,893 --> 01:37:56,511
- We are up to a 5.9.
- Damn it.

1390
01:37:56,564 --> 01:37:59,399
At this rate, they nick the earth's
atmosphere and bounce off into space.

1391
01:37:59,483 --> 01:38:01,857
- We need another burn
to get them back in the corridor.
- Definitely another burn.

1392
01:38:01,904 --> 01:38:05,486
- Another burn. Copy that.
- Fire the engines and get 'em on course.

1393
01:38:24,926 --> 01:38:27,215
Aquarius, this is Houston.

1394
01:38:27,262 --> 01:38:30,798
Houston, Aquarius.

1395
01:38:30,891 --> 01:38:34,095
Jim, we've got another
course correction for you.

1396
01:38:34,186 --> 01:38:36,262
What's up?

1397
01:38:36,354 --> 01:38:39,107
Something about another
course correction.

1398
01:38:39,191 --> 01:38:42,145
Uh, we copy, Houston.

1399
01:38:42,235 --> 01:38:46,566
Be advised it's gonna take Freddo and I
a while to power up the computer...

1400
01:38:46,657 --> 01:38:49,823
for the alignment platform
if we have to fire the engine.

1401
01:38:49,909 --> 01:38:51,819
Negative on that, Jim.

1402
01:38:51,912 --> 01:38:55,163
We can't spare power
for the computer.

1403
01:38:55,249 --> 01:38:57,324
We gotta do this blind?

1404
01:38:57,417 --> 01:39:01,497
Without the computer,
what do we use for orientation?

1405
01:39:01,588 --> 01:39:04,293
We've got to be able
to give these guys something.

1406
01:39:04,382 --> 01:39:06,672
Without the power,
we can't give them a reading.

1407
01:39:06,761 --> 01:39:08,670
I'm not talking about power,
I'm talking about reference.

1408
01:39:08,762 --> 01:39:11,515
No, there's no references.
We have debris up there.

1409
01:39:11,890 --> 01:39:15,010
Houston, what's the story
with this burn?

1410
01:39:15,102 --> 01:39:18,019
We're trying to hash something out
down here, Aquarius.

1411
01:39:18,105 --> 01:39:20,014
Stand by.

1412
01:39:20,107 --> 01:39:25,350
Look, Houston. All we need to hold
attitude is one fixed point in space.

1413
01:39:25,446 --> 01:39:29,692
- Is that not correct?
- Yeah. Roger that, Jim.

1414
01:39:31,577 --> 01:39:36,037
Well, Houston, we've got one.

1415
01:39:36,123 --> 01:39:40,038
If we can keep the Earth
in the window, flying manually,

1416
01:39:40,128 --> 01:39:42,036
the co-ax cross hairs
right on its terminator,

1417
01:39:42,128 --> 01:39:45,794
all I have to know is: How long
do we need to burn the engine?

1418
01:39:45,841 --> 01:39:49,211
- The shorter, the better.
- Roger that, Jim.

1419
01:39:49,303 --> 01:39:51,546
Can they fly it manually
and still shut it down...

1420
01:39:51,640 --> 01:39:54,212
on time without the computer?

1421
01:39:55,934 --> 01:39:58,391
I guess that's the best we can do.

1422
01:39:58,479 --> 01:40:00,472
We're out of time.

1423
01:40:00,523 --> 01:40:02,481
In order to enter
the atmosphere safely,

1424
01:40:02,525 --> 01:40:05,894
the crew must aim for a corridor
just two and a half degrees wide.

1425
01:40:05,987 --> 01:40:09,402
If they're too steep, they'll incinerate
in the steadily thickening air.

1426
01:40:09,489 --> 01:40:11,399
If they're too shallow,
they'll ricochet...

1427
01:40:11,492 --> 01:40:13,900
off the atmosphere like
a rock skipping off a pond.

1428
01:40:13,994 --> 01:40:16,236
The reentry corridor is,
in fact, so narrow...

1429
01:40:16,330 --> 01:40:18,406
that if this basketball
were the Earth...

1430
01:40:18,500 --> 01:40:20,410
and this softball
were the moon,

1431
01:40:20,502 --> 01:40:22,910
and the two were placed
14 feet apart,

1432
01:40:23,004 --> 01:40:27,216
the crew would have to hit a target
no thicker than this piece of paper.

1433
01:40:27,300 --> 01:40:29,672
Okay, people, on your toes.
We're doing this one blind.

1434
01:40:29,761 --> 01:40:32,335
Gene, I want you to understand
we've never tried this before:

1435
01:40:32,430 --> 01:40:36,344
Burn, cold soak, burn,
cold soak, burn, manual control.

1436
01:40:36,434 --> 01:40:38,510
Look, it will ignite, will it not?

1437
01:40:38,604 --> 01:40:42,018
I just want you to know the engine's
never been tried like this.

1438
01:40:42,106 --> 01:40:44,514
That's all I'm trying to tell you.

1439
01:40:44,610 --> 01:40:46,519
I know what you're trying to do.

1440
01:40:46,611 --> 01:40:48,852
I guarantee you, I won't hold you
personally responsible.

1441
01:40:48,945 --> 01:40:52,897
If it lights, it lights.
Let Lovell do the rest.

1442
01:40:52,992 --> 01:40:54,903
Okay.

1443
01:40:54,995 --> 01:40:57,200
They're gonna burn the engines
and steer it manually,

1444
01:40:57,289 --> 01:41:00,160
attempting to keep
the Earth in the window.

1445
01:41:06,882 --> 01:41:10,049
Okay, this is gonna take
all three of us.

1446
01:41:10,135 --> 01:41:12,460
Freddo...

1447
01:41:12,554 --> 01:41:14,463
you handle the pitch.

1448
01:41:14,556 --> 01:41:16,964
Put on the translation
controllers, all backwards.

1449
01:41:17,058 --> 01:41:19,728
So if the Earth starts drifting down,

1450
01:41:19,771 --> 01:41:23,720
you need to thrust aft,
not forward.

1451
01:41:23,816 --> 01:41:25,773
I'll do the same on mine
with everything else.

1452
01:41:25,860 --> 01:41:28,730
We're going to burn at ten percent
thrust for 39 seconds.

1453
01:41:28,779 --> 01:41:31,530
- Jack, you time us.
- Got it.

1454
01:41:31,573 --> 01:41:34,907
Give us a count of
the last ten seconds up to 39.

1455
01:41:34,995 --> 01:41:37,448
Let's not miss this.

1456
01:41:39,081 --> 01:41:42,615
You up to this, Freddo?

1457
01:41:42,709 --> 01:41:44,618
I'm with you.

1458
01:41:44,711 --> 01:41:48,295
Standing by
for corridor control burn.

1459
01:41:48,382 --> 01:41:51,135
Okay, Jim,
you can fire when ready.

1460
01:41:51,219 --> 01:41:53,591
You are go
for the manual burn.

1461
01:41:53,637 --> 01:41:57,302
Okay, X plus button
at ten seconds. Mark.

1462
01:41:57,390 --> 01:42:00,096
- Come on, baby. One more burn.
- Nine, eight,

1463
01:42:00,144 --> 01:42:02,765
seven, six, five,

1464
01:42:02,854 --> 01:42:05,097
- four, three,
- Ullage is go.

1465
01:42:05,190 --> 01:42:08,276
Two, one, ignition!

1466
01:42:09,403 --> 01:42:11,230
- She's burnin'!
- Oh, yeah.

1467
01:42:11,280 --> 01:42:14,151
- Master arm off.
- Okay, here we go.

1468
01:42:14,241 --> 01:42:18,155
- Helium regulator on.
- R.C.S. Is go, 10% thrust.

1469
01:42:18,245 --> 01:42:21,745
- Bring her around, Freddo.
- I'm tryin', but it's draggin'.

1470
01:42:21,791 --> 01:42:24,791
- Ten seconds.
- Drop it down, Freddo.

1471
01:42:24,834 --> 01:42:26,958
- We're driftin'!
- No, hold what you got.

1472
01:42:27,045 --> 01:42:29,169
- I'll roll it. Back off.
- I can't get it stable.

1473
01:42:29,256 --> 01:42:31,748
She's dancin' all over the place!

1474
01:42:31,801 --> 01:42:34,256
- Come to the right a little bit.
- Fifteen seconds.

1475
01:42:34,303 --> 01:42:36,758
She's driftin'.
I'm losin' attitude.

1476
01:42:36,805 --> 01:42:39,476
Hold it right there.
That's it. No, Freddo, back!

1477
01:42:39,517 --> 01:42:42,138
- Shit! I'm losin' it!
- Bring the Earth up.

1478
01:42:42,227 --> 01:42:45,644
Forward, Fred.
Come on. Forward.

1479
01:42:45,732 --> 01:42:48,402
Shit, I lost it!
Where is it? Where is it?

1480
01:42:48,486 --> 01:42:50,392
7:00. Helium regulator's closed.

1481
01:42:50,486 --> 01:42:52,811
Bring it down, Freddo.
Just nose it down.

1482
01:42:52,906 --> 01:42:54,649
- Okay, uh, okay, I got it!
- Thirty seconds.

1483
01:42:54,699 --> 01:42:57,486
Little farther.
Ease your touch!

1484
01:42:57,535 --> 01:43:02,825
Damn it! Damn it, that's mine.
That's me. Around.

1485
01:43:02,874 --> 01:43:05,958
- A little more. Come on, baby.
- Come on, that's it. Hold it. Damn it!

1486
01:43:06,001 --> 01:43:09,039
- Back! That's it! Hold it! Steady.
...seven, eight, nine!

1487
01:43:09,130 --> 01:43:11,836
Shutdown!

1488
01:43:19,683 --> 01:43:23,015
Houston, we have shutdown.

1489
01:43:23,060 --> 01:43:26,845
That's close enough, Jim. Good work.

1490
01:43:26,898 --> 01:43:29,898
I knew it! I knew it!
How about that LEM, huh?

1491
01:43:29,983 --> 01:43:32,357
How about it?

1492
01:43:32,445 --> 01:43:35,150
- Guess you can keep your job.
- You betcha.

1493
01:43:35,198 --> 01:43:39,825
Thirteen, stand by. We're evaluating
our power usage on that burn.

1494
01:43:39,870 --> 01:43:43,820
Well, let's hope we don't
have to do that again.

1495
01:43:57,554 --> 01:44:02,548
Gentlemen, you've given our guys
enough to survive 'til reentry.

1496
01:44:02,600 --> 01:44:04,558
Well done.

1497
01:44:06,814 --> 01:44:11,190
Now we gotta get 'em in, so tell me
about the power-up procedures.

1498
01:44:11,233 --> 01:44:13,725
Here's the order
of what I want to do.

1499
01:44:13,820 --> 01:44:18,529
I want to power up Guidance,
E.C.S., Communications,

1500
01:44:18,575 --> 01:44:22,620
warm up the pyros for the parachutes
and the command module thrusters.

1501
01:44:22,704 --> 01:44:25,112
The thrusters are gonna
put you over budget on amps.

1502
01:44:25,207 --> 01:44:29,620
They've been sitting at 200 below for
four days, John. They gotta be heated.

1503
01:44:29,712 --> 01:44:31,752
Fine. Then trade off
the parachutes, something.

1504
01:44:31,798 --> 01:44:34,751
Well, if the chutes
don't open, what's the point?

1505
01:44:34,841 --> 01:44:37,925
You're telling me what you need.
I'm telling you what we have
to work with at this point.

1506
01:44:37,970 --> 01:44:39,928
I'm not making this stuff up.

1507
01:44:39,973 --> 01:44:42,213
They're going to need
all these systems, John.

1508
01:44:42,265 --> 01:44:46,596
We do not have the power, Ken.
We just don't have it.

1509
01:44:48,481 --> 01:44:51,765
Okay, I'm gonna go back
and reorganize the sequencing again...

1510
01:44:51,859 --> 01:44:53,982
and find more power.

1511
01:44:54,070 --> 01:44:58,149
Let's start from scratch.
Clear the board.

1512
01:45:00,202 --> 01:45:02,989
I don't know where the hell
we're gonna find it.

1513
01:45:03,496 --> 01:45:06,662
Apollo 13 commander Jim Lovell
has more time in space,

1514
01:45:06,748 --> 01:45:09,620
almost 24 days already,
than any other man,

1515
01:45:09,710 --> 01:45:12,332
and I asked him recently
if he ever was scared.

1516
01:45:12,423 --> 01:45:15,624
I've had an engine flame out
a few times in an aircraft...

1517
01:45:15,717 --> 01:45:19,299
and was curious as to whether it
was going to light up again,

1518
01:45:19,345 --> 01:45:22,631
but, uh, they seem to work out.

1519
01:45:22,681 --> 01:45:25,968
Is there an instance
in an airplane emergency...

1520
01:45:26,019 --> 01:45:27,977
when you can recall fear?

1521
01:45:28,022 --> 01:45:32,481
Uh, well, I remember this one time,

1522
01:45:32,525 --> 01:45:36,191
I'm in a Banshee at night in
combat conditions, so there's no
running lights on the carrier.

1523
01:45:36,280 --> 01:45:39,777
It was the Shangri-la,
and we were in the Sea of Japan.

1524
01:45:39,824 --> 01:45:43,773
My radar had jammed,
and my homing signal was gone...

1525
01:45:43,827 --> 01:45:46,200
because somebody in Japan
was actually using the same frequency,

1526
01:45:46,288 --> 01:45:49,623
and so it was leading me away
from where I was supposed to be.

1527
01:45:49,667 --> 01:45:55,373
I'm looking down at a big, black ocean,
so I flip on my map light.

1528
01:45:55,465 --> 01:45:59,332
Then, suddenly, zap, everything
shorts out right there in my cockpit.

1529
01:45:59,385 --> 01:46:03,169
All my instruments are gone.
My lights are gone and I can't
even tell what my altitude is.

1530
01:46:03,222 --> 01:46:08,467
I know I'm running out of fuel, so I'm
thinking about ditching into the ocean.

1531
01:46:08,521 --> 01:46:12,018
I look down there
and then, in the darkness,

1532
01:46:12,064 --> 01:46:15,184
there's this, uh,
there's this green trail.

1533
01:46:15,234 --> 01:46:19,896
It's like a long carpet that's just laid
out right beneath me. It was the algae.

1534
01:46:19,990 --> 01:46:21,899
It was that phosphorescent stuff...

1535
01:46:21,992 --> 01:46:24,364
that gets churned up
in the wake of a big ship.

1536
01:46:24,453 --> 01:46:27,536
It was, it was, it was
just leading me home.

1537
01:46:27,580 --> 01:46:29,538
If my cockpit lights
hadn't shorted out,

1538
01:46:29,583 --> 01:46:32,952
there's no way I'd have ever
been able to see that.

1539
01:46:33,046 --> 01:46:35,536
So, uh, you, uh,
you never know...

1540
01:46:35,589 --> 01:46:39,372
what, what events are going
to transpire to get you home.

1541
01:46:42,846 --> 01:46:48,352
Spacecraft commander Jim Lovell,
no stranger to emergencies.

1542
01:46:58,529 --> 01:47:02,148
- How's it going, Fred?
- I'm okay.

1543
01:47:02,241 --> 01:47:06,072
What the hell was that?

1544
01:47:06,119 --> 01:47:09,074
Let's hope it was
just the burst disk.

1545
01:47:09,165 --> 01:47:13,377
- Can you confirm a burst helium disk?
- We confirm that.

1546
01:47:13,419 --> 01:47:17,582
Houston, is that going to
affect our, uh, entry angle at all?

1547
01:47:17,673 --> 01:47:20,923
Uh, negative. Your entry angle
is holding at 6.24, Aquarius.

1548
01:47:21,011 --> 01:47:23,630
Houston, uh...

1549
01:47:23,720 --> 01:47:27,090
we, we sure could use...

1550
01:47:27,141 --> 01:47:29,431
the reentry procedure up here.

1551
01:47:29,519 --> 01:47:31,640
When can we expect that?

1552
01:47:33,898 --> 01:47:36,603
Uh, that's coming
real soon, Aquarius.

1553
01:47:36,693 --> 01:47:39,361
Uh, Houston, we, we...

1554
01:47:39,444 --> 01:47:42,565
We just can't throw this
together at the last minute.

1555
01:47:42,616 --> 01:47:45,284
So, here's what you're gonna do.

1556
01:47:45,367 --> 01:47:49,116
You're gonna get the procedure
up to us, whatever it is,

1557
01:47:49,163 --> 01:47:53,826
and we're gonna go over it
step by step, so there's no foul-ups.

1558
01:47:53,919 --> 01:47:57,452
I don't have to tell you
we're all a little tired up here.

1559
01:47:57,546 --> 01:48:00,298
The world's getting awfully big
in the window.

1560
01:48:00,340 --> 01:48:02,831
- Jim, this is Deke.
- It's Deke.

1561
01:48:02,927 --> 01:48:05,169
They don't know how to do it.

1562
01:48:05,263 --> 01:48:10,968
- Maybe Jack's right.
- Hello there, Deke. What's the story?

1563
01:48:11,018 --> 01:48:13,058
We're gonna get that
power-up procedure to you.

1564
01:48:13,146 --> 01:48:15,103
We're gonna get it
as soon as we possibly can.

1565
01:48:15,148 --> 01:48:19,441
Ken Mattingly's
in the simulator right now.

1566
01:48:19,486 --> 01:48:21,858
Ken's working on it?

1567
01:48:22,030 --> 01:48:26,324
Look...

1568
01:48:26,409 --> 01:48:28,317
I know this sequence works, John.

1569
01:48:28,411 --> 01:48:31,246
The sequence looks good.
We're just over budget on the amperage.

1570
01:48:31,331 --> 01:48:33,704
- By how much?
- Three or four amps.

1571
01:48:33,792 --> 01:48:35,950
Goddamn it, John!
Is it three or four?

1572
01:48:36,002 --> 01:48:37,876
- Four.
- Four!

1573
01:48:37,962 --> 01:48:41,664
Four more amps.

1574
01:48:51,517 --> 01:48:54,353
We know they have some power left
in the LEM batteries, right?

1575
01:48:54,395 --> 01:48:56,685
Yeah.

1576
01:48:56,773 --> 01:49:00,853
We have an umbilical that provides power
from the command module to the LEM.

1577
01:49:00,902 --> 01:49:04,402
- It's backup for the LEM power supply.
- I'm listening.

1578
01:49:04,489 --> 01:49:06,695
So... reverse it.

1579
01:49:06,782 --> 01:49:09,025
Reverse the flow and see if
we can draw these four amps...

1580
01:49:09,120 --> 01:49:11,028
from the LEM batteries
before we cut it lose.

1581
01:49:11,121 --> 01:49:15,368
- Why can't we do that?
- We don't have a procedure for that?

1582
01:49:15,458 --> 01:49:17,536
You're gonna lose a lot
in the transfer, Ken.

1583
01:49:17,586 --> 01:49:21,536
Yeah, yeah, but all we're
talking about here is four amps.

1584
01:49:21,591 --> 01:49:24,709
I want whatever you guys got
on these power procedures.

1585
01:49:24,801 --> 01:49:28,217
- Gene, they're already...
- I don't want the whole bible,
just a couple of chapters.

1586
01:49:28,305 --> 01:49:30,548
- We've got to get something
up to these guys.
- They're working on it.

1587
01:49:30,642 --> 01:49:33,047
- I'll call the simulator
and get an estimate.
- Goddamn it!

1588
01:49:33,143 --> 01:49:38,387
I don't want another estimate!
I want the procedures... now!

1589
01:49:48,658 --> 01:49:50,699
I.M.U. Is up.

1590
01:49:52,163 --> 01:49:54,914
- How am I reading?
- Fine, so far.

1591
01:49:54,998 --> 01:49:57,407
- Say again.
- You're under the limit. Keep going.

1592
01:49:57,460 --> 01:50:00,710
Okay. Floodlights to fixed.

1593
01:50:01,964 --> 01:50:06,425
Okay, I'm bringing up the guidance.

1594
01:50:06,468 --> 01:50:09,042
Here we go.

1595
01:50:11,098 --> 01:50:13,220
C.M.C. Attitude I.M.U.

1596
01:50:13,266 --> 01:50:16,221
C.M.C. Source.

1597
01:50:16,270 --> 01:50:20,647
C.M.C. Mode, auto,
and we're on the computer.

1598
01:50:27,447 --> 01:50:30,070
Ken?

1599
01:50:30,118 --> 01:50:33,284
- Go ahead.
- Is your computer on now?

1600
01:50:33,370 --> 01:50:37,701
Up and running.
How do we look?

1601
01:50:41,378 --> 01:50:43,584
John?

1602
01:50:46,926 --> 01:50:49,132
I think we got it, buddy.

1603
01:50:59,480 --> 01:51:01,936
Arthur, my notes are clear
on that last sequence, right?

1604
01:51:01,984 --> 01:51:03,442
Yeah.

1605
01:51:03,485 --> 01:51:05,476
- Excuse me, gentlemen.
- I was getting a little blurry there.

1606
01:51:09,490 --> 01:51:11,947
Here's Ken. Here's John.

1607
01:51:11,993 --> 01:51:14,117
It's good to see you, Ken.

1608
01:51:14,163 --> 01:51:16,284
This is the sequence.

1609
01:51:16,330 --> 01:51:18,786
- Was it tried on the hardware yet?
- We didn't have time.

1610
01:51:20,835 --> 01:51:23,622
Aquarius, Houston.
Do you read?

1611
01:51:23,671 --> 01:51:27,800
Yeah, we read you, Ken.

1612
01:51:27,843 --> 01:51:30,714
Are the flowers blooming in Houston?

1613
01:51:30,805 --> 01:51:35,679
Uh, that's a negative, Jim.
I don't have the measles.

1614
01:51:37,436 --> 01:51:41,647
Jim, is Jack in there with you?

1615
01:51:41,689 --> 01:51:45,140
Uh, yeah, stand by one.
We gotta get him on comm.

1616
01:51:45,192 --> 01:51:48,146
- Put those on the table.
- Oh, damn it. Thanks, Jackie.

1617
01:51:48,195 --> 01:51:50,486
I think it would
really help if you could...

1618
01:51:50,532 --> 01:51:55,159
just distract her when
the heavy predictions come in.

1619
01:51:55,205 --> 01:51:57,992
- Yeah, yeah. We'll give it a shot.
- Thanks.

1620
01:51:58,041 --> 01:51:59,997
Blanch.

1621
01:52:00,041 --> 01:52:03,576
Blanch, these nice, young men
are gonna watch the television with you.

1622
01:52:03,670 --> 01:52:05,912
This is Neil Armstrong,
and this is Buzz Aldrin.

1623
01:52:06,007 --> 01:52:07,417
Nice to meet you.

1624
01:52:07,508 --> 01:52:12,749
- Hi.
- Are you boys in the space program too?

1625
01:52:12,845 --> 01:52:17,009
Okay, Jack, give me a read-back
on that last procedure.

1626
01:52:17,058 --> 01:52:21,935
Uh, stand by, Ken.

1627
01:52:22,022 --> 01:52:26,767
Ken, I'm having trouble
reading my own writing.

1628
01:52:26,861 --> 01:52:30,444
I guess I was a little
more tired than I thought.

1629
01:52:35,369 --> 01:52:37,991
Uh, don't worry, Jack.
I'll talk you through it.

1630
01:52:40,540 --> 01:52:43,661
Okay, find the main
bus breakers on panel 11.

1631
01:52:45,170 --> 01:52:47,080
Yeah, main bus breakers.

1632
01:52:47,173 --> 01:52:49,249
- Got it.
- Close main bus B.

1633
01:52:56,890 --> 01:53:01,102
Ken, there's an awful lot
of condensation on these panels.

1634
01:53:01,144 --> 01:53:03,601
What's the word on these
things shorting out?

1635
01:53:08,318 --> 01:53:11,604
Uh, we'll just take that
one at a time, Jack.

1636
01:53:13,658 --> 01:53:17,441
It's like tryin' to drive
a toaster through a car wash.

1637
01:53:24,334 --> 01:53:27,040
Main bus B is closed.

1638
01:53:27,130 --> 01:53:29,917
Okay, Thirteen, we're coming up
on entry interface.

1639
01:53:29,966 --> 01:53:33,749
Flight, we're still shallowing up
a bit in the reentry corridor.

1640
01:53:33,802 --> 01:53:35,961
It's almost like
they're underweight.

1641
01:53:36,055 --> 01:53:41,097
- Now how could they be underweight?
- We didn't land on the moon.

1642
01:53:41,144 --> 01:53:43,682
- Rocks?
- That's affirm.

1643
01:53:43,772 --> 01:53:45,680
Uh, one more thing, Jim.

1644
01:53:45,772 --> 01:53:48,228
While Jack's working on the power-up,
we'd like you and Freddo...

1645
01:53:48,317 --> 01:53:50,987
to transfer some ballast
over to the command module.

1646
01:53:51,028 --> 01:53:52,986
Uh, say again, Houston.
Ballast?

1647
01:53:53,073 --> 01:53:56,322
Um, that's affirm.
We got to get the weight right.

1648
01:53:56,409 --> 01:54:00,109
We were expecting you to be toting
a couple hundred pounds of moon rocks.

1649
01:54:00,162 --> 01:54:02,119
Right, Houston.

1650
01:54:02,165 --> 01:54:04,323
- Now, Jack.
- Yeah, go ahead, Ken.

1651
01:54:04,417 --> 01:54:07,502
Okay, now, uh, panel five.

1652
01:54:07,587 --> 01:54:12,498
Circuit breaker caution
and warning main B closed.

1653
01:54:12,550 --> 01:54:15,041
Main B closed.

1654
01:54:15,136 --> 01:54:17,710
Master alarm off.

1655
01:54:17,806 --> 01:54:21,886
Okay, Jack, uh, on panel seven,
B-MAG number two, power to warm-up.

1656
01:54:21,976 --> 01:54:24,550
B-MAG number two,
power to warm-up done.

1657
01:54:24,647 --> 01:54:27,647
Sequential logic one and two on.

1658
01:54:27,691 --> 01:54:30,359
Sequential logic... two on.

1659
01:54:30,401 --> 01:54:33,853
C.M.R.C.S. Pressure on.

1660
01:54:33,947 --> 01:54:35,822
C.M.R.C.S. Pressurization.

1661
01:54:36,408 --> 01:54:39,326
As her husband prepares to jettison
his lunar module lifeboat,

1662
01:54:39,369 --> 01:54:42,239
Marilyn Lovell waits with her
children, her neighbors...

1663
01:54:42,330 --> 01:54:47,039
and, we are told, Apollo 11 astronauts
Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin.

1664
01:54:47,128 --> 01:54:49,796
Only the Lovell's eldest son,
Jay, is absent...

1665
01:54:49,880 --> 01:54:51,791
as he holds vigil
with his classmates...

1666
01:54:51,883 --> 01:54:55,500
at the St. Johns Military Academy
in Wisconsin.

1667
01:54:55,552 --> 01:54:58,839
ABC News science editor
Jules Bergman.

1668
01:54:58,890 --> 01:55:02,092
With a crippled command module, and
surviving by using the LEM's systems,

1669
01:55:02,184 --> 01:55:04,094
there can be no easy maneuver.

1670
01:55:04,186 --> 01:55:07,353
Their LEM lifeboat is doing things
and working longer...

1671
01:55:07,398 --> 01:55:09,354
than it was ever intended to.

1672
01:55:09,399 --> 01:55:11,855
It's a race against time
until splashdown.

1673
01:55:11,902 --> 01:55:14,227
Okay, Jack, we're ready to see
if the computer will accept...

1674
01:55:14,321 --> 01:55:19,742
- uplink of the reentry data now.
- Okay, the I.M.U. Is up.

1675
01:55:19,785 --> 01:55:24,080
- We got our eight-balls back.
- Copy that.

1676
01:55:24,123 --> 01:55:27,575
Okay, Ken, uh, uplink telemetry,
command module to accept, right?

1677
01:55:27,668 --> 01:55:32,247
That's affirm.
Go ahead and try it.

1678
01:55:32,299 --> 01:55:34,336
Come on.

1679
01:55:50,357 --> 01:55:52,267
Uplink completed.

1680
01:55:57,740 --> 01:55:59,780
- Yeah. That's more like it.
- We're back in business.

1681
01:55:59,825 --> 01:56:01,284
- Yeah.
- Okay, let's go.

1682
01:56:01,369 --> 01:56:03,409
Look at your amps. How we doin'?

1683
01:56:06,581 --> 01:56:08,492
We got her back up, Ken.

1684
01:56:08,585 --> 01:56:10,790
Boy, I wish
you were here to see it.

1685
01:56:10,879 --> 01:56:14,329
I'll bet you do.

1686
01:56:14,423 --> 01:56:17,875
Way to go, Jack.

1687
01:56:22,640 --> 01:56:24,764
- Flight, this is RETRO.
- Go, RETRO.

1688
01:56:24,810 --> 01:56:27,300
Flight, we are looking
at a typhoon warning...

1689
01:56:27,395 --> 01:56:30,598
- on the edge of the prime recovery zone.
- Say again, RETRO.

1690
01:56:30,647 --> 01:56:34,598
We are looking at a typhoon warning
on the edge of the prime recovery area.

1691
01:56:34,653 --> 01:56:37,357
This is just a warning.
It could miss them.

1692
01:56:37,447 --> 01:56:39,985
Only if their luck changes.

1693
01:56:40,366 --> 01:56:42,608
Jim, we're ready
for S.M. Jettison!

1694
01:56:42,660 --> 01:56:46,195
All right, Jack, on three!

1695
01:56:46,289 --> 01:56:49,493
One... two...

1696
01:56:49,542 --> 01:56:52,664
- upward thrust.
- We're loose!

1697
01:56:52,755 --> 01:56:54,792
Reverse thrust!

1698
01:56:54,838 --> 01:56:56,962
We have service module jettison.

1699
01:56:57,008 --> 01:56:59,963
Okay, Houston,
service module is free.

1700
01:57:00,012 --> 01:57:02,134
We're gonna take a look
at what we have here.

1701
01:57:02,180 --> 01:57:04,220
Copy that.

1702
01:57:07,978 --> 01:57:10,302
There it is. I see it!

1703
01:57:10,354 --> 01:57:13,226
Oh.

1704
01:57:13,317 --> 01:57:16,900
Houston, we're getting our first look
at the service module now.

1705
01:57:16,987 --> 01:57:20,735
One whole side
of the spacecraft is missing.

1706
01:57:20,824 --> 01:57:24,739
Right by the high gain antennae
a whole panel is blown out,

1707
01:57:24,829 --> 01:57:28,908
right up, right up
to our heat shield.

1708
01:57:29,000 --> 01:57:31,574
Uh, copy that, Aquarius.

1709
01:57:31,669 --> 01:57:34,454
It looked like it got
the engine bell too. Can you see that?

1710
01:57:38,550 --> 01:57:41,220
Oh, man, that's incredible.

1711
01:57:44,223 --> 01:57:45,883
The heat shield.

1712
01:57:46,433 --> 01:57:51,772
The heat will build up to as much
as 3,000 or 4,000 degrees Fahrenheit.

1713
01:57:51,856 --> 01:57:54,097
On a lunar reentry flight,
the heat approaches 4,000 degrees.

1714
01:57:54,191 --> 01:57:55,900
So, uh, Blanch?

1715
01:57:55,944 --> 01:57:59,941
Blanch? Did Jim make
Eagle Scout or not?

1716
01:58:00,032 --> 01:58:02,070
- Yes, he did.
- He did.

1717
01:58:02,157 --> 01:58:04,400
If the heat shield
is even slightly cracked,

1718
01:58:04,452 --> 01:58:07,072
the extreme cold
could have split it wide open.

1719
01:58:07,120 --> 01:58:10,407
Worst of all, if the pyrotechnics
that control the parachutes...

1720
01:58:10,458 --> 01:58:13,246
have been damaged,
the chutes may not open at all,

1721
01:58:13,294 --> 01:58:17,125
causing the spacecraft to hit the water
not at a gentle 20 miles per hour,

1722
01:58:17,214 --> 01:58:19,623
but at a suicidal 300.

1723
01:58:19,718 --> 01:58:21,625
Perhaps never in human history...

1724
01:58:21,719 --> 01:58:24,886
has the entire world been united
by such a global drama.

1725
01:58:24,931 --> 01:58:28,098
In New York City, thousands
of people have gathered...

1726
01:58:28,142 --> 01:58:30,976
to watch updates of the mission
in Times Square.

1727
01:58:31,060 --> 01:58:33,766
Many countries offered help,
and the State Department said...

1728
01:58:33,857 --> 01:58:36,099
it would ask for it
if it were needed.

1729
01:58:36,151 --> 01:58:39,187
The House and Senate passed resolutions
calling on the American people...

1730
01:58:39,278 --> 01:58:41,603
to pray tonight
for the astronauts.

1731
01:58:41,697 --> 01:58:44,984
In Rome, Pope Paul
led 50,000 people...

1732
01:58:45,076 --> 01:58:47,828
in prayers for the safe
return of the astronauts.

1733
01:58:47,912 --> 01:58:50,285
In Jerusalem,
prayers at the Wailing Wall.

1734
01:58:56,129 --> 01:58:59,462
Uh, it's about time to bail
out of this ship, Freddo.

1735
01:59:03,344 --> 01:59:05,302
Freddo?

1736
01:59:06,473 --> 01:59:08,679
You okay?

1737
01:59:08,766 --> 01:59:12,017
I'm, uh... I'm freezing.

1738
01:59:13,938 --> 01:59:16,774
Can you hold out
just a little longer?

1739
01:59:16,817 --> 01:59:20,067
- Long as I have to.
- Aw, come on.

1740
01:59:20,154 --> 01:59:24,068
It won't be long.
Just a little while longer, Freddo.

1741
01:59:26,117 --> 01:59:30,994
Just a little while longer. We're gonna
hit that water in the South Pacific.

1742
01:59:31,081 --> 01:59:34,495
Open up that hatch.

1743
01:59:34,541 --> 01:59:39,039
- It's 80 degrees out there.
- Eighty degrees.

1744
01:59:40,425 --> 01:59:44,885
- You are a mess.
- Y-Yeah.

1745
01:59:44,970 --> 01:59:48,421
Odyssey, Houston.
Uh, how we doin', guys?

1746
01:59:48,515 --> 01:59:50,803
We're closing in
on lunar module jettison.

1747
01:59:50,850 --> 01:59:52,891
As you know,
that is time critical.

1748
01:59:52,978 --> 01:59:55,765
We should be making our move
into the command module.

1749
01:59:55,855 --> 01:59:57,766
Let's get that hatch
buttoned up,

1750
01:59:57,858 --> 02:00:01,523
and, when you get a chance,
let us know how you're doing.

1751
02:00:01,611 --> 02:00:03,022
Roger that.

1752
02:00:03,112 --> 02:00:07,360
Let me give you a hand there, Freddo.

1753
02:00:42,694 --> 02:00:45,530
We're coming up on LEM jettison.

1754
02:00:45,573 --> 02:00:48,063
Is everyone strapped in, Ken?
We're getting real close.

1755
02:00:48,116 --> 02:00:52,863
Uh, copy that, Flight. Uh, 13, Houston.
Uh, we're coming up on LEM jettison.

1756
02:00:52,914 --> 02:00:55,071
Stand by.

1757
02:00:55,164 --> 02:00:57,917
Have you got everybody
in the Odyssey?

1758
02:00:57,960 --> 02:01:01,246
Yeah, Ken, I'm gonna check those
pyro batteries one more time here.

1759
02:01:01,339 --> 02:01:03,912
Okay, the pyro batts look good.

1760
02:01:03,966 --> 02:01:07,170
I don't think we're gonna
have to tie the other batteries.

1761
02:01:19,482 --> 02:01:21,937
Sorry, Jack,
this is an old habit.

1762
02:01:22,026 --> 02:01:25,230
I'm kind of used to the pilot's seat.
She's yours to fly.

1763
02:01:29,826 --> 02:01:34,287
Okay, Odyssey, I want to double check
some reentry procedures...

1764
02:01:34,331 --> 02:01:38,956
right after we jettison the LEM,
which is coming up in 30 seconds.

1765
02:01:39,043 --> 02:01:41,250
What is that?

1766
02:01:41,297 --> 02:01:43,620
Oh, I was getting
a little punchy,

1767
02:01:43,714 --> 02:01:47,464
and I didn't want to cut the LEM loose
with you guys still in it.

1768
02:01:47,552 --> 02:01:49,711
That's good thinking.

1769
02:01:52,264 --> 02:01:54,174
Stand by, Houston.

1770
02:01:56,770 --> 02:01:59,556
We have lunar module jettison.

1771
02:02:06,488 --> 02:02:09,359
She sure was a good ship.

1772
02:02:10,742 --> 02:02:14,822
Farewell, Aquarius, and we thank you.

1773
02:02:20,669 --> 02:02:24,417
Mary?

1774
02:02:24,505 --> 02:02:28,006
It's almost time, honey.

1775
02:02:30,011 --> 02:02:32,051
Flight 9-6-6-4-0-6.

1776
02:02:52,743 --> 02:02:54,488
Let me put it this way.

1777
02:02:54,538 --> 02:02:56,907
The trajectory may be off.
Their thrusters may be frozen.

1778
02:02:56,997 --> 02:02:59,073
Their guidance system
might be malfunctioning.

1779
02:02:59,165 --> 02:03:01,076
Their heat shield could be cracked.

1780
02:03:01,169 --> 02:03:04,417
And their parachutes
might be three blocks of ice.

1781
02:03:04,504 --> 02:03:06,545
Clearly, we have
some obstacles to overcome.

1782
02:03:06,590 --> 02:03:09,959
Yeah, okay, but now I'm asking you,
when will we know?

1783
02:03:10,052 --> 02:03:12,127
Well, blackout lasts
for three minutes.

1784
02:03:12,220 --> 02:03:16,882
If they're not back
in four, we'll know.

1785
02:03:16,934 --> 02:03:21,431
Velocity now reading
34,802 feet per second.

1786
02:03:21,522 --> 02:03:24,094
- Range to go 2,625 nautical miles.
- Copy that.

1787
02:03:24,191 --> 02:03:27,310
Okay, Ken,
we are aligned for reentry.

1788
02:03:27,402 --> 02:03:29,811
Jim, we're going to need
that computer reentry program.

1789
02:03:29,905 --> 02:03:34,485
- Fred, how are the batteries looking?
- Okay. Batt A looks good.

1790
02:03:34,578 --> 02:03:36,652
Reentry interface in one minute...

1791
02:03:36,744 --> 02:03:40,909
- Batt B, no volts, the amps are okay.
- And 30 seconds.

1792
02:03:40,999 --> 02:03:43,289
Batt C...

1793
02:03:43,377 --> 02:03:46,793
shit, no volts, only two amps.

1794
02:03:46,882 --> 02:03:49,455
It may die before
the main chutes open.

1795
02:03:49,550 --> 02:03:52,669
Roger. Let's tie all the batteries
onto main A and main B.

1796
02:03:52,761 --> 02:03:56,297
Flight, they're still shallowing a bit
up there. Do you want to tell 'em?

1797
02:03:56,391 --> 02:04:00,175
- Is there anything we can do about it?
- Not now, Flight.

1798
02:04:00,269 --> 02:04:02,641
- Then they don't need to know, do they?
- Copy that.

1799
02:04:02,730 --> 02:04:05,137
RETRO says the typhoon is still
a presence in the splashdown area?

1800
02:04:05,232 --> 02:04:09,445
- Yeah.
- We got the parachute situation,

1801
02:04:09,487 --> 02:04:11,860
the heat shield, the angle
of trajectory and the typhoon.

1802
02:04:11,948 --> 02:04:14,191
There's so many variables,
I'm a little at a loss...

1803
02:04:14,284 --> 02:04:15,860
I know what the problems are.

1804
02:04:15,950 --> 02:04:18,324
This could be the worst disaster
NASA's ever experienced.

1805
02:04:18,412 --> 02:04:23,952
With all due respect, sir, I believe
this is going to be our finest hour.

1806
02:04:24,043 --> 02:04:26,796
Okay.

1807
02:04:35,805 --> 02:04:39,969
Expect entry interface
in 45 seconds.

1808
02:04:40,059 --> 02:04:42,265
And on my mark, your velocity...

1809
02:04:42,312 --> 02:04:47,058
will be 35,245 feet per second.

1810
02:04:47,151 --> 02:04:50,601
Mark 35 seconds
to entry interface.

1811
02:04:52,906 --> 02:04:56,902
Gentlemen...

1812
02:04:56,992 --> 02:04:59,698
it's been a privilege
flying with you.

1813
02:05:40,704 --> 02:05:43,492
Flight, we have loss
of radio contact.

1814
02:05:43,541 --> 02:05:44,868
Roger that.

1815
02:05:44,958 --> 02:05:47,497
Expect to regain signal
in three minutes.

1816
02:05:50,673 --> 02:05:53,044
It all depends
on the heat shield.

1817
02:06:25,624 --> 02:06:28,247
Back to the Iwo Jima
and our live cameras there.

1818
02:06:28,295 --> 02:06:32,587
The Navy recovery and rescue
helicopters already airborne,

1819
02:06:32,673 --> 02:06:35,212
circling, waiting
for first radar contact.

1820
02:06:35,259 --> 02:06:38,297
Coming up now on three minutes
until time of drogue deployment.

1821
02:06:38,388 --> 02:06:40,296
Bill, what time you got?

1822
02:06:40,389 --> 02:06:44,256
Standing by for any reports
of acquisition.

1823
02:06:47,855 --> 02:06:51,769
One minute and 30 seconds
to end of blackout.

1824
02:06:56,905 --> 02:06:58,815
No reentering ship
has ever taken longer...

1825
02:06:58,908 --> 02:07:02,610
than three minutes
to emerge from blackout.

1826
02:07:02,663 --> 02:07:05,579
This is the critical moment.
Will the heat shield hold?

1827
02:07:05,622 --> 02:07:09,573
Will the command module survive
the intense heat of reentry?

1828
02:07:09,627 --> 02:07:12,581
If it doesn't,
there'll only be silence.

1829
02:07:12,630 --> 02:07:16,082
- Mommy, you're squishing me.
- Oops, sorry, sweetie.

1830
02:07:16,134 --> 02:07:18,175
It's okay.

1831
02:07:33,485 --> 02:07:36,107
Okay, Flight,
that's three minutes.

1832
02:07:36,155 --> 02:07:39,605
- We are standing by for acquisition.
- Copy that.

1833
02:07:41,075 --> 02:07:44,113
Odyssey, Houston. Do you read me?

1834
02:07:44,162 --> 02:07:46,155
Odyssey, this is Houston.
Do you read?

1835
02:07:46,247 --> 02:07:49,165
Expected time of reacquisition,

1836
02:07:49,210 --> 02:07:52,163
the time when the astronauts were
expected to come out of blackout,

1837
02:07:52,212 --> 02:07:56,838
has come and gone.

1838
02:07:56,925 --> 02:08:00,507
About all any of us can do now
is just listen and hope.

1839
02:08:00,596 --> 02:08:04,129
We're about to learn whether
or not that heat shield,

1840
02:08:04,182 --> 02:08:06,555
which was damaged
by the explosion three days ago,

1841
02:08:06,644 --> 02:08:09,312
has withstood
the inferno of reentry.

1842
02:08:12,732 --> 02:08:16,268
Odyssey, this is Houston.
Do you read me?

1843
02:08:18,780 --> 02:08:21,354
Odyssey, Houston.
Do you read?

1844
02:08:21,408 --> 02:08:25,405
Three minutes, 30 seconds. Standing by.

1845
02:08:25,496 --> 02:08:29,411
Odyssey, Houston. Do you read?

1846
02:08:35,506 --> 02:08:40,299
Odyssey, this is Houston.
Do you read me?

1847
02:08:43,221 --> 02:08:46,092
That's four minutes.
Standing by.

1848
02:09:07,789 --> 02:09:10,743
Odyssey, uh, Houston. Do you read?

1849
02:09:18,759 --> 02:09:21,379
Hello, Houston, this is Odyssey.

1850
02:09:21,427 --> 02:09:24,795
It's good to see you again.

1851
02:09:46,660 --> 02:09:49,615
Odyssey, Houston.
Welcome home.

1852
02:09:49,664 --> 02:09:51,953
We're glad to see you.

1853
02:09:52,000 --> 02:09:54,954
- Good job, Ken. Good job.
- Thank you.

1854
02:10:38,546 --> 02:10:41,832
They made it. They made it.

1855
02:10:52,520 --> 02:10:56,732
- Yeah!
- Lunney.

1856
02:11:22,883 --> 02:11:26,797
Houston, we're at stable one.
The ship is secure.

1857
02:11:26,887 --> 02:11:29,592
This is Apollo 13 signing off.

1858
02:11:29,681 --> 02:11:32,848
Good job.

1859
02:12:22,110 --> 02:12:24,898
Our mission was called
a successful failure,

1860
02:12:24,946 --> 02:12:28,647
in that we returned safely,
but never made it to the moon.

1861
02:12:28,742 --> 02:12:32,111
In the following months,
it was determined...

1862
02:12:32,203 --> 02:12:35,120
that a damaged coil built
inside the oxygen tank...

1863
02:12:35,205 --> 02:12:39,786
sparked during our cryo stir and caused
the explosion that crippled the Odyssey.

1864
02:12:39,879 --> 02:12:42,285
It was a minor defect
that occurred two years...

1865
02:12:42,380 --> 02:12:45,464
before I was named
the flight's commander.

1866
02:12:45,550 --> 02:12:49,133
Fred Haise was going back
to the moon on Apollo 18,

1867
02:12:49,221 --> 02:12:51,462
but his mission was canceled
because of budget cuts.

1868
02:12:51,555 --> 02:12:53,513
He never flew in space again.

1869
02:12:53,601 --> 02:12:56,804
Nor did Jack Swigert,
who left the astronaut corps...

1870
02:12:56,895 --> 02:12:59,980
and was elected to Congress
from the state of Colorado.

1871
02:13:00,065 --> 02:13:03,980
But he died of cancer before
he was able to take office.

1872
02:13:04,028 --> 02:13:08,274
Ken Mattingly orbited the moon
as command module pilot of Apollo 16...

1873
02:13:08,324 --> 02:13:12,155
and flew the space shuttle,
having never gotten the measles.

1874
02:13:12,203 --> 02:13:17,658
Gene Kranz retired as Director
of Flight Operations just not long ago.

1875
02:13:17,750 --> 02:13:20,621
And many other members of Mission
Control have gone on to other things,

1876
02:13:20,670 --> 02:13:22,661
but some are still there.

1877
02:13:22,754 --> 02:13:25,458
And as for me...

1878
02:13:25,507 --> 02:13:30,465
the seven extraordinary days
of Apollo 13 were my last in space.

1879
02:13:30,512 --> 02:13:35,138
I watched other men walk on the moon
and return safely,

1880
02:13:35,184 --> 02:13:39,844
all from the confines of Mission Control
and our house in Houston.

1881
02:13:39,938 --> 02:13:43,141
I sometimes catch myself
looking up at the moon,

1882
02:13:43,191 --> 02:13:46,643
remembering the changes
of fortune in our long voyage,

1883
02:13:46,695 --> 02:13:52,152
thinking of the thousands of people who
worked to bring the three of us home.

1884
02:13:52,201 --> 02:13:55,320
I look up at the moon
and wonder...

1885
02:13:55,369 --> 02:13:57,992
when will we be going back...

1886
02:13:58,040 --> 02:14:01,659
and who will that be?

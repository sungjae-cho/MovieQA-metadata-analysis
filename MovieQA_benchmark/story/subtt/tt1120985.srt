No pressure, it's just, you know,

My Country, 'Tis of Thee.
It will be acapella.

142
00:10:22,810 --> 00:10:24,232

Hey, I had an idea...

150
00:11:09,023 --> 00:11:12,152
I thought maybe you should
go visit your grandpa today.

00:11:12,234 --> 00:11:15,363
- What do you think?
- Yeah!

152

Did you find Megan?

No.

154
00:11:23,371 --> 00:11:26,124
But I was thinking maybe
she moved out to Hollywood,

155
00:11:26,207 --> 00:11:28,426
and she became a movie dog.

156
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:33,635
You think? You think she moved out
to Hollywood to be a movie dog?

157
00:11:35,049 --> 00:11:38,895
She had the looks, don't you think?
Maybe that's what happened, huh?

00:12:19,552 --> 00:12:21,600
Honey, go say bye-bye to Daddy, OK?

00:12:21,679 --> 00:12:23,477
You're not gonna
see him until tomorrow.

169

00:12:35,609 --> 00:12:37,862
- I love you.
- Have fun, OK, buddy?

173
00:12:38,279 --> 00:12:39,280
OK.

174
00:12:39,363 --> 00:12:41,206
You remember what to do
when Pa snores, right?

175
00:12:41,282 --> 00:12:44,502
- Cover his mouth and hold his nose.
- That's my girl.

176
00:12:44,577 --> 00:12:46,329
OK, go have fun.

177
00:12:46,412 --> 00:12:48,414
[Cindy] All right, run to Mama!

178
00:12:48,497 --> 00:12:51,250
Come on, you can do it!
Come on, sweetie pie.

179
00:12:51,751 --> 00:12:53,549
Yay, that was great.

180
00:12:54,462 --> 00:12:57,090
That was great.
All right, you ready to go inside?

181
00:12:58,132 --> 00:13:00,510
So what's with him,
you two fighting again?

182
00:13:00,593 --> 00:13:02,015
[Cindy] We'll talk about it later.

183
00:13:02,094 --> 00:13:03,641
[Frankie] Why isn't Daddy
gonna come in?

184
00:13:03,763 --> 00:13:04,764
[Cindy] I don't know.

185
00:13:27,828 --> 00:13:30,502
- Mr. Benatti, good to meet you.
- Have a seat.

186
00:13:30,581 --> 00:13:32,754
What kind of job are you applying for?

187
00:13:32,833 --> 00:13:36,303
- Driver? Helper? Packer?
- Whatever, one that pays.

188
00:13:36,378 --> 00:13:38,380
- Do you have any experience at all?
- Sure.

189
00:13:39,131 --> 00:13:40,553
Where have you worked?

190
00:13:40,633 --> 00:13:42,761
I mean, you know,
I've helped people move before.

191
00:13:42,843 --> 00:13:44,220
You mean, what are my jobs?

192
00:13:44,303 --> 00:13:45,555
But you've never worked
for a moving company?

193
00:13:45,638 --> 00:13:46,764
No.

194
00:13:46,847 --> 00:13:49,942
OK, so that would be "no experience."
Where are you from?

195
00:13:50,017 --> 00:13:51,860
- Florida.
- And how long have you been here?

196
00:13:51,936 --> 00:13:54,109
- Like two years.
- And where are you living?

197
00:13:54,188 --> 00:13:57,112
- I live in Brooklyn.
- Can you get here every day?

198
00:13:57,191 --> 00:13:59,785
- Yeah, I'll get here.
- I need you here by 7:00am.

199
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:01,112
I'll get here.

200
00:14:01,195 --> 00:14:02,447
- Ready?
- Yeah.

201
00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:04,624
- Hold it. There you go.
- All right, Marshall.

202
00:14:04,698 --> 00:14:07,952
- Good job!
- You're a man amongst men. No homo!

203
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:11,088
[Marshall] Sit up, son! Sit up, sit up!

204
00:14:14,708 --> 00:14:18,463
Don't worry about it. You ain't
a professional yet, that's all.

205
00:14:20,047 --> 00:14:21,424
[Dean] How do you meet girls?

206
00:14:21,549 --> 00:14:23,472
[Marshall] I just walk up,
talk to them.

207
00:14:23,551 --> 00:14:25,599
Whatever comes in my mind
at that moment.

208
00:14:25,678 --> 00:14:27,305
- [man] He honks the horn.
- I gets out of the truck.

209
00:14:27,388 --> 00:14:29,311
I get out the truck and talk to 'em.

210
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:31,233
[man] Or he screams out,
like, "chocolate thunder."

211
00:14:31,392 --> 00:14:32,939
[laughing]

212
00:14:34,228 --> 00:14:37,277
[Dean] See, I don't know. I feel like
men are more romantic than women.

213
00:14:37,356 --> 00:14:39,529
When we get married,
we marry, like, one girl.

214
00:14:39,608 --> 00:14:43,488
'Cause we 're resistant the whole way,
until we meet one girl and we think,

215
00:14:43,571 --> 00:14:46,324
"I'd be an idiot if I didn't marry
this girl, she's so great. ”

216
00:14:46,407 --> 00:14:49,331
But it seems like girls get
to a place, they just kinda pick,

217
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:50,912
pick the best option or something.

218
00:14:50,995 --> 00:14:53,839
I know girls that get married, they're
like, "Oh, he's got a good job."

219
00:14:53,914 --> 00:14:56,167
I mean, they spend their whole life
looking for Prince Charming,

220
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:58,719
and then they... then they marry,
they marry the guy

221
00:14:58,794 --> 00:15:01,513
that's got a good job
and who's gonna stick around.

222
00:15:01,589 --> 00:15:03,887
[man] Take your share and go home,
OK? Let's call it a good night.

223
00:15:03,966 --> 00:15:05,183
Thanks, Jamie.

224
00:15:05,301 --> 00:15:06,723
[ukulele playing]

225
00:15:40,044 --> 00:15:43,048
Lemme tell you something.
When I get old, I'm gonna look good.

226
00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:44,552
When you get old,
you're gonna look like him.

227
00:15:44,632 --> 00:15:46,305
What do you mean "when" you get old?

228
00:15:46,383 --> 00:15:48,727
It's gonna be a long time,
another 50 years.

229
00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:52,894
[Marshall] Damn, it look like
World War III in this motherfucker.

230
00:15:52,973 --> 00:15:56,068
[Jamie] OK, look, box everything in
the kitchen, bag everything upstairs.

231
00:15:56,143 --> 00:15:59,317
Let's get this truck loaded,
up to Pennsylvania and back by tonight.

232
00:16:30,344 --> 00:16:32,563
[man speaks indistinctly]

233
00:16:35,057 --> 00:16:38,027
- This is a small, small room here.
- Here we go.

234
00:16:39,687 --> 00:16:41,781
How's all the stuff gonna fit in here?

235
00:16:41,855 --> 00:16:43,778
[Jamie] it's probably not gonna,
so strip the furniture.

236
00:16:43,857 --> 00:16:46,326
OK, I'll bring you boxes,
you start unpacking, placing.

237
00:16:46,402 --> 00:16:48,621
Flatten all the cartons,
we'll get 'em outta here.

238
00:16:48,696 --> 00:16:51,165
- What happens to all the other stuff?
- [Jamie] Not our problem.

239
00:17:00,374 --> 00:17:01,375
[exhales heavily]

240
00:17:12,886 --> 00:17:15,230
[Marshall] Come on, come on,
speed it up, speed it up.

241
00:17:18,684 --> 00:17:21,904
Gotta go. We gotta go. We gotta go.

242
00:17:21,979 --> 00:17:23,071
I don't understand
what you're trying to say.

243
00:17:23,147 --> 00:17:26,651
[Marshall] We gotta go.
We got another job to do, we gotta go.

244
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:31,197
[Jamie] Dean, you ready?
Let's get outta here, OK?

245
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,408
Job's over, here.
I'll give you your pay.

246
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:35,117
- One hundred...
- Damn.

247
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:38,670
One hundred and ten...
and 20 is part of your tip, OK?

248
00:17:38,746 --> 00:17:41,420
Let's go, we've got
a two-hour ride back to the city.

249
00:17:43,709 --> 00:17:45,336
Walter!

250
00:17:45,419 --> 00:17:48,889
OK... Don't be mad.

251
00:17:50,090 --> 00:17:52,309
I hung some of your stuff,
I hope it's OK.

252
00:17:52,384 --> 00:17:55,684
You wanna walk in here?
You don't wanna get wheeled in here.

253
00:17:55,763 --> 00:17:57,265
This is your new house.

254
00:17:58,265 --> 00:18:00,484
I hung your uniform. I hope that's OK.

255
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:03,062
It's just so handsome, you know?

256
00:18:08,609 --> 00:18:11,362
I noticed you had a lot of matches,
so I stuck 'em on the wall.

257
00:18:11,445 --> 00:18:14,289
If you don't like it, you can
just take 'em down. It's tape.

258
00:18:16,450 --> 00:18:18,123
Do you wanna sit down in the chair?

259
00:18:18,202 --> 00:18:20,170
- OK.
- Please.

260
00:18:20,245 --> 00:18:23,044
Here, let me get this out of your way.

261
00:18:24,625 --> 00:18:26,172
You got it?

262
00:18:26,251 --> 00:18:27,798
OK, Walter,
I'm gonna get in trouble, I gotta go,

263
00:18:27,878 --> 00:18:31,508
but I'm gonna show you a few things, OK?
That's your shoes, see?

264
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:34,264
- Hey, Dean we gotta go, all right?
- Yo. OK.

265
00:18:34,343 --> 00:18:36,095
- I'll meet you in the truck.
- OK.

266
00:18:37,388 --> 00:18:41,564
And... He's not the boss of me,
by the way. What else?

267
00:18:41,642 --> 00:18:45,146
All your stuffs in here.
That's your pants, sweaters, shirts.

268
00:18:45,229 --> 00:18:48,233
Hey, Walter, is this your wife?
Is this you and your wife?

269
00:18:48,649 --> 00:18:49,650
[exhales]

270
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:52,828
She was a beautiful woman.

271
00:18:54,446 --> 00:18:56,448
OK, nice to meet ya.

272
00:18:57,449 --> 00:18:59,042
- Thank you.
- Good luck here.

273
00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:03,289
OK. I'll see ya down the road.

274
00:19:08,335 --> 00:19:09,712
[birds chirping]

275
00:19:15,175 --> 00:19:17,018
[shovel scraping]

276
00:19:32,901 --> 00:19:34,244
- [sniffles]
- I'm sorry.

277
00:19:36,697 --> 00:19:38,040
I know.

278
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:45,372
Don't be sorry, baby.

279
00:19:48,625 --> 00:19:50,593
Oh, fuck.

280
00:19:51,879 --> 00:19:53,552
I'm just tired, you know.

281
00:20:01,054 --> 00:20:02,852
I'm just fucking tired.

282
00:20:04,016 --> 00:20:05,484
Come here, boy!

283
00:20:08,854 --> 00:20:11,152
[Dean] Maybe it's because we didn't
make it comfy enough in there.

284
00:20:13,066 --> 00:20:15,319
Maybe we made it too girly.

285
00:20:15,944 --> 00:20:19,164
- Too girly?
- Yeah.

286
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:25,462
[Dean] Well, I think it...
Maybe we just need to put something...

287
00:20:25,537 --> 00:20:28,666
...like a nice blanket
in there for him to lay on.

288
00:20:28,749 --> 00:20:30,592
- [Frankie] OK.
- [Dean] You think that's a good idea?

289
00:20:30,667 --> 00:20:32,840
- [Frankie] Yeah, let's get a blanket.
- [Dean] OK, buddy.

290
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:36,140
[Frankie] But don't take
the one I usually do.

291
00:20:36,215 --> 00:20:38,843
[Dean] OK, you better ask your mom
which blanket's OK to use,

292
00:20:38,926 --> 00:20:41,179
because I don't want to get in trouble.

293
00:20:41,261 --> 00:20:45,016
- [Frankie] OK. Will you open this up?
- [Dean] Watch your hands.

294
00:20:45,098 --> 00:20:48,443
But close it quickly,
'cause the dog is in there.

295
00:20:49,436 --> 00:20:50,779
Can you take the trash out?

296
00:20:50,854 --> 00:20:53,232
Yeah. Baby, do you know
where we put that...

297
00:20:56,527 --> 00:20:57,904
I got an idea.

298
00:21:01,615 --> 00:21:03,834
Hello?

299
00:21:03,909 --> 00:21:07,129
I'm calling to see if I can make
a reservation for tonight.

300
00:21:07,204 --> 00:21:10,583
- I have a gift certificate.
- [whispering] No.

301
00:21:10,666 --> 00:21:12,339
What's our options?

302
00:21:13,752 --> 00:21:17,723
They have Cupid's Cove room available.

303
00:21:17,798 --> 00:21:20,722
I'm not going to some cheesy sex motel.
I'm on call tomorrow.

304
00:21:20,801 --> 00:21:22,599
What else? That's it?

305
00:21:23,428 --> 00:21:25,772
Oh, and there's a Future Room.
Can you hold on one second?

306
00:21:25,847 --> 00:21:29,067
- Baby, will you make the decision?
- I'm on call. I can't go.

307
00:21:29,142 --> 00:21:30,234
Baby, please.

308
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:31,778
- Listen to me for a second.
- What do you want me to say?

309
00:21:31,853 --> 00:21:34,857
Can you hold on one second?
Listen to me for a second.

310
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:37,193
Would you stop cleaning for one minute?

311
00:21:37,276 --> 00:21:40,200
- What?
- I'm asking you. Please.

312
00:21:40,279 --> 00:21:43,829
Let's get outta here.
We gotta get outta here.

313
00:21:43,907 --> 00:21:44,908
[sighs]

314
00:21:45,867 --> 00:21:48,461
Baby, we have to get out of this house.

315
00:21:48,537 --> 00:21:50,835
Let's go get drunk and make love.

316
00:21:54,418 --> 00:21:58,093
- Now, do you want the Cupid's Cove...
- Dean, I don't wanna...

317
00:21:58,171 --> 00:22:01,300
...or do you want the Future Room?

318
00:22:02,092 --> 00:22:04,140
Make a decision, baby, please.

319
00:22:04,219 --> 00:22:06,938
I don't want to get in the car
at 7:30 and drive for two hours.

320
00:22:07,014 --> 00:22:11,360
OK. I'll make the decision.
The Future Room.

321
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:14,613
For two.

322
00:22:17,441 --> 00:22:19,819
- Periera.
- You're crazy.

323
00:22:21,236 --> 00:22:22,579
[Dean] Thanks.

324
00:22:30,037 --> 00:22:32,586
Pack your bags, baby,
we're going to the future.

325
00:22:43,383 --> 00:22:46,637
[man chuckles] Oh, my God.
ls that Cindy Heller?

326
00:22:49,765 --> 00:22:54,487
- Bobby Ontario?
- [laughing] How are you?

327
00:22:54,561 --> 00:22:59,032
- I'm good. How are you?
- I'm... you know, I'm hanging in there.

328
00:22:59,107 --> 00:23:03,112
Wow. Wow. it's been a while.

329
00:23:08,909 --> 00:23:10,786
- How about you?
- Yeah, here.

330
00:23:10,869 --> 00:23:14,089
Here. Been here,
stayed here, never left here.

331
00:23:14,164 --> 00:23:16,292
Here's good, here's good.

332
00:23:17,376 --> 00:23:18,844
- Married?
- Married.

333
00:23:18,919 --> 00:23:21,889
- Married.
- That's crazy. Lucky guy.

334
00:23:23,256 --> 00:23:26,931
- Have you been faithful to him?
- [laughs nervously]

335
00:23:29,596 --> 00:23:33,317
That's a strange question to ask
somebody you haven't seen in forever.

336
00:23:33,392 --> 00:23:35,019
Yeah, well, you know...

337
00:23:35,102 --> 00:23:36,820
- Seriously.
- Yes.

338
00:23:36,895 --> 00:23:38,522
Yes you have, or yes you haven't?

339
00:23:38,605 --> 00:23:41,233
Yes... I have, I mean, I have...
I have been...

340
00:23:43,485 --> 00:23:45,658
Why are you looking at me like that?

341
00:23:47,489 --> 00:23:49,617
I'm not looking at you like anything.

342
00:23:50,283 --> 00:23:51,705
Oh, OK.

343
00:23:54,162 --> 00:23:55,960
- Yeah.
- Uh.

344
00:24:03,922 --> 00:24:05,390
Come on, let's go.

345
00:24:07,217 --> 00:24:08,469
Let's go.

346
00:24:15,976 --> 00:24:17,649
What you thinking?

347
00:24:21,148 --> 00:24:22,821
What's on your mind?

348
00:24:26,987 --> 00:24:29,831
You're never gonna guess
who I saw at the liquor mart.

349
00:24:31,074 --> 00:24:35,295
- [Dean] Richard Grieco?
- No, but good guess.

350
00:24:37,122 --> 00:24:39,250
Jon Bon Jovi.

351
00:24:40,208 --> 00:24:41,881
Bobby Ontario.

352
00:24:55,682 --> 00:24:58,151
What the fuck was he doing there?

353
00:24:58,226 --> 00:25:01,105
[Cindy] I don't know...
I mean, buying liquor, I guess.

354
00:25:04,357 --> 00:25:06,200
[Dean] Jesus.

355
00:25:06,276 --> 00:25:09,576
- How come you're just telling me now?
- 'Cause I'm telling you now.

356
00:25:09,654 --> 00:25:12,032
How come you didn't tell me
when we were there?

357
00:25:12,115 --> 00:25:15,119
I don't know, 'cause I was flustered
and I'm telling you now.

358
00:25:15,202 --> 00:25:17,125
- You talked to him?
- No. I mean like,

359
00:25:17,204 --> 00:25:20,959
- "Hi, bye, how are you..."
- How are you?

360
00:25:21,041 --> 00:25:25,547
- Yeah, he asked me how I was.
- And you told him?

361
00:25:25,629 --> 00:25:28,974
I mean, I didn't want to,
but we were stuck there.

362
00:25:29,049 --> 00:25:32,053
We were in the same store,
buying things together at the same time.

363
00:25:34,554 --> 00:25:39,105
I wish you'd seen him. I wish you'd...
You wouldn't feel so bad. He's fat...

364
00:25:39,184 --> 00:25:40,982
- What do I care?
- I don't know.

365
00:25:41,061 --> 00:25:42,813
What do I care if he's fat or not?

366
00:25:45,357 --> 00:25:47,405
What does that mean?
Make me feel better?

367
00:25:47,484 --> 00:25:49,407
I don't know. 'Cause he's a loser.

368
00:25:51,154 --> 00:25:53,498
What does that have to do with me?

369
00:25:53,573 --> 00:25:56,372
Whether he's a loser or he's fat or not?
What the fuck do I care?

370
00:25:56,451 --> 00:25:57,873
I don't... What!?

371
00:25:57,953 --> 00:26:03,676
What are you saying that for? That
would make me feel better, he's fat?

372
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:06,799
So what? If he was in good shape,
I shouldn't feel good?

373
00:26:06,878 --> 00:26:08,926
I said the wrong thing.
I'm nervous, OK?

374
00:26:09,548 --> 00:26:13,598
- What do you mean you're nervous?
- I feel funny, because you feel funny.

375
00:26:16,263 --> 00:26:18,231
You're nervous 'cause I feel funny?

376
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:21,773
- What does that mean?
- I feel like I said the wrong thing.

377
00:26:21,852 --> 00:26:24,150
I feel like I shouldn't have
said anything.

378
00:26:25,230 --> 00:26:27,107
Really? That's an option?

379
00:26:28,441 --> 00:26:32,321
You run into Bobby Ontario
and it's an option not to tell me?

380
00:26:33,572 --> 00:26:36,041
I feel like you're upset,
and I upset you and I'm sorry.

381
00:26:36,116 --> 00:26:37,834
And I said the wrong thing.

382
00:26:38,994 --> 00:26:41,713
Baby... you can do whatever you want.

383
00:26:43,790 --> 00:26:45,133
OK.

384
00:26:49,045 --> 00:26:51,093
I'm sorry.

385
00:26:53,550 --> 00:26:54,551
[Dean sighs]

386
00:27:00,307 --> 00:27:01,809
Fuck.

387
00:27:03,226 --> 00:27:06,400
- What are you doing?
- I gotta pee.

388
00:27:06,479 --> 00:27:08,948
- Where, in this person's house?
- Fuck you.

389
00:27:09,024 --> 00:27:10,571
Fuck me.

390
00:27:54,027 --> 00:27:55,529
[indistinct shouting]

391
00:28:04,371 --> 00:28:05,372
[whistle blows]

392
00:28:05,538 --> 00:28:06,881
[shouting continues]

393
00:28:18,051 --> 00:28:20,224
- [whistle blows]
- [applause]

394
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:35,243
Hi.

395
00:28:37,570 --> 00:28:40,619
- What are you doing?
- Research.

396
00:28:41,366 --> 00:28:44,415
Really, research.

397
00:28:45,245 --> 00:28:48,465
So what, I mean,
you're supposed to be a quadriplegic?

398
00:28:49,457 --> 00:28:52,336
No, quads can't use their arms.
I'm a paraplegic.

399
00:28:53,753 --> 00:28:55,255
Really?

400
00:28:58,925 --> 00:29:00,142
Hi.

401
00:29:03,054 --> 00:29:07,025
Why do you have to act like
such a freak all the time, huh? Huh?

402
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:08,943
Come over.

403
00:29:11,021 --> 00:29:12,318
- Come on.
- I can't.

404
00:29:12,397 --> 00:29:14,616
- I can't.
- You know you want it.

405
00:29:14,691 --> 00:29:16,785
I gotta go get Gramma.

406
00:29:17,819 --> 00:29:19,412
I just came to say hi.

407
00:29:23,158 --> 00:29:26,503
- Call you later.
- Yeah. Whatever!

408
00:29:28,913 --> 00:29:32,042
- [woman] Oh! I thought you were Dad.
- Just us.

409
00:29:32,125 --> 00:29:36,005
- [woman] How was the beauty parlor?
- Oh, lovely, just lovely.

410
00:29:36,087 --> 00:29:37,384
Good.

411
00:29:38,298 --> 00:29:40,721
What did it feel like
when you fell in love?

412
00:29:42,343 --> 00:29:43,640
Ooh...

413
00:29:46,681 --> 00:29:48,058
Oh, dear.

414
00:29:50,101 --> 00:29:51,728
I don't think I found it.

415
00:29:52,479 --> 00:29:54,402
[Cindy] Even with Grandpa?

416
00:29:55,815 --> 00:29:58,534
Maybe a little in the beginning.

417
00:29:58,610 --> 00:30:01,659
Bless us, O Lord, for these, thy gifts
which we are about to receive...

418
00:30:01,738 --> 00:30:06,209
[Gramma] He didn't really have
any regard for me as a person.

419
00:30:06,284 --> 00:30:08,537
You've gotta be careful of that.

420
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:12,500
You've gotta be careful that
the person that you fall in love...

421
00:30:14,375 --> 00:30:16,377
...is worth it to you.

422
00:30:18,213 --> 00:30:21,012
[Cindy] I don't ever want
to be like my parents.

423
00:30:21,091 --> 00:30:24,641
I know that they must have loved
each other at one time, right?

424
00:30:24,719 --> 00:30:28,189
Did they just get it all out of the way
before they had me?

425
00:30:28,264 --> 00:30:30,562
[Pa] We're supposed to
eat this garbage?

426
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:34,897
Huh?!

427
00:30:36,022 --> 00:30:37,524
[woman] I'm sorry.

428
00:30:38,066 --> 00:30:40,694
- Do you want me to make you some eggs?
- [Pa] No!

429
00:30:42,445 --> 00:30:45,790
I want you to enjoy
your goddamned dinner!

430
00:30:48,326 --> 00:30:52,081
[Cindy] How do you trust your feelings
when they can just disappear like that?

431
00:30:54,749 --> 00:31:00,506
[Gramma] I think the only way you can
find out is... to have the feeling.

432
00:31:02,215 --> 00:31:04,092
You're a good person, honey.

433
00:31:05,552 --> 00:31:08,681
I think you have the right to say,
"Yes, I do trust. "

434
00:31:09,556 --> 00:31:11,558
"I trust myself. "

435
00:31:20,066 --> 00:31:22,239
[panting, moaning]

436
00:31:27,657 --> 00:31:29,375
[grunting]

437
00:31:37,375 --> 00:31:38,376
[heavy panting]

438
00:31:41,045 --> 00:31:44,094
- [moans]
- What?

439
00:31:45,466 --> 00:31:46,763
What, what?

440
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,603
- Fuck!
- Shit.

441
00:31:53,641 --> 00:31:55,439
- Fuck!
- Sorry.

442
00:32:07,906 --> 00:32:09,533
[locking door]

443
00:32:19,709 --> 00:32:21,711
[urinating]

444
00:32:33,306 --> 00:32:36,480
[Cindy] "Somehow, she didn't want to
confess to him that she was still wary

445
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:39,233
of all those people who'd
seemed to want to care about her.

446
00:32:40,313 --> 00:32:43,032
He touched her cheek gently,
caressing her.

447
00:32:44,525 --> 00:32:47,825
Her heart was beating so loudly
that surely he could hear it. ”

448
00:32:47,904 --> 00:32:49,406
Arms up.

449
00:32:49,489 --> 00:32:50,911
[Cindy] "He smoothed her hair back,

450
00:32:50,990 --> 00:32:54,494
the touch of his fingers sending
waves of awareness through her.

451
00:32:54,577 --> 00:32:57,751
He was going to kiss her.
That was what she wanted, wasn't it?

452
00:32:57,830 --> 00:33:01,334
So why did she feel as if she trembled
on the edge of a precipice,

453
00:33:01,417 --> 00:33:03,465
ready to topple over in an instant?

454
00:33:03,544 --> 00:33:07,845
Then his lips found hers
and she stopped thinking at all,

455
00:33:07,924 --> 00:33:10,768
only feeling,
feeling the tenderness of his kiss,

456
00:33:10,843 --> 00:33:13,687
the strength of his arms around her...

457
00:33:15,348 --> 00:33:19,774
...the steady beat of his heart under
her hand as she turned into his arms.

458
00:33:20,311 --> 00:33:22,780
There is a precipice,
and she was falling.

459
00:33:22,855 --> 00:33:25,734
Head over heels.
Falling in love with him.

460
00:33:26,859 --> 00:33:27,985
Chapter 11 ..."

461
00:33:28,569 --> 00:33:29,866
Hi.

462
00:33:30,321 --> 00:33:31,868
- Hi.
- Hi.

463
00:33:32,490 --> 00:33:37,121
- I want a cigarette.
- No, Gramma, it's bedtime.

464
00:33:37,203 --> 00:33:39,456
You're in bed.
You can't have a cigarette now, OK?

465
00:33:39,539 --> 00:33:41,712
Do you want me
to keep reading or are you tired?

466
00:33:41,791 --> 00:33:44,214
I need a cigarette!

467
00:33:58,474 --> 00:34:02,229
[indistinct chattering]

468
00:34:16,326 --> 00:34:17,327
[knocking on door]

469
00:34:18,244 --> 00:34:22,249
Excuse me.
Can I talk to you for a second?

470
00:34:22,957 --> 00:34:24,254
Why?

471
00:34:24,334 --> 00:34:26,587
You think I stole that money, don't you?

472
00:34:27,754 --> 00:34:30,007
- Yeah, you do.
- No.

473
00:34:30,089 --> 00:34:33,684
Look, I've stolen money before, OK?
I know what it's like to get busted.

474
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:35,057
- That's what it feels like.
- OK.

475
00:34:35,136 --> 00:34:37,184
I didn't steal it. I got a job.

476
00:34:37,263 --> 00:34:40,016
- OK? This is my job.
- All right.

477
00:34:40,099 --> 00:34:42,067
- All right? I make money.
- OK, I got it.

478
00:34:42,143 --> 00:34:44,942
Money I can take girls out
on dates with.

479
00:34:47,482 --> 00:34:49,234
Just so you know.

480
00:34:49,776 --> 00:34:51,824
Good to know. OK.

481
00:34:55,573 --> 00:34:58,417
- What's your name?
- Go away.

482
00:34:58,493 --> 00:34:59,836
- "Go away"?
- Go away.

483
00:34:59,911 --> 00:35:01,504
That's a weird name.

484
00:35:02,163 --> 00:35:03,665
OK, hold on a second.

485
00:35:05,458 --> 00:35:10,840
I wanna give you something.
Look at that. That's my business card.

486
00:35:12,298 --> 00:35:15,723
I don't have a phone...
or a phone number,

487
00:35:15,802 --> 00:35:18,726
but if you call
this number right here...

488
00:35:20,139 --> 00:35:21,937
...and then you ask for me...

489
00:35:22,016 --> 00:35:24,189
- ...they'll tell me you called.
- Great.

490
00:35:24,268 --> 00:35:25,941
Who should I say is calling?

491
00:35:38,533 --> 00:35:39,785
[door beeps]

492
00:35:43,371 --> 00:35:44,918
Whoa!

493
00:35:45,790 --> 00:35:47,337
Where are we, huh?

494
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:52,718
We're inside a robot's vagina.

495
00:35:57,677 --> 00:35:59,679
[chuckling]

496
00:35:59,762 --> 00:36:01,981
[Cindy] Was this the only one
that they had?

497
00:36:02,056 --> 00:36:07,108
[Dean] I told you, you know...
they had Cupid's Cove or this.

498
00:36:07,186 --> 00:36:08,984
You want me to see
if we can get Cupid's Cove?

499
00:36:09,063 --> 00:36:10,406
[Cindy] I'm gonna make a drink.

500
00:36:16,195 --> 00:36:17,697
There's no windows.

501
00:36:19,949 --> 00:36:24,329
Cool bed, huh? Check this out.

502
00:36:25,496 --> 00:36:27,089
- [bed humming]
- [Dean] Whoa!

503
00:36:27,707 --> 00:36:31,337
The bed turns.
Hey, did you see this?

504
00:36:33,045 --> 00:36:34,342
Hey.

505
00:36:38,176 --> 00:36:39,928
Hey, look at me.

506
00:36:40,803 --> 00:36:44,433
- I don't think that there's a fridge.
- [Dean laughing]

507
00:36:44,891 --> 00:36:46,234
[cawing]

508
00:36:48,895 --> 00:36:51,364
Hey, that's how they laugh
in the future. Like this...

509
00:36:51,481 --> 00:36:52,482
[cawing]

510
00:36:52,815 --> 00:36:53,816
[Dean laughs]

511
00:36:54,484 --> 00:36:55,485
[cawing]

512
00:36:57,069 --> 00:36:58,116
Oh, God.

513
00:36:58,196 --> 00:37:01,871
I thought the whole point of coming here
was to have a night without kids.

514
00:37:01,991 --> 00:37:02,992
[phone ringing]

515
00:37:04,952 --> 00:37:07,671
Hello? Yeah, hold on.

516
00:37:08,915 --> 00:37:12,044
Here, sweetheart, it's your mommy.
She wants to talk to you.

517
00:37:14,003 --> 00:37:16,552
- Hi, Mom.
- [Cindy] Hi, sweetie!

518
00:37:17,507 --> 00:37:18,508
[wooing noises]

519
00:37:19,133 --> 00:37:20,476
Yes.

520
00:37:20,551 --> 00:37:24,021
OK, honey. Don't forget
to go potty before you get into bed, OK?

521
00:37:25,264 --> 00:37:28,188
Bye... Bye, I love you!

522
00:37:28,267 --> 00:37:30,065
Frankie, this is
how they laugh in the future.

523
00:37:30,186 --> 00:37:32,860
[cawing]

524
00:37:36,067 --> 00:37:37,444
Try it.

525
00:37:39,278 --> 00:37:40,404
Huh?

526
00:37:40,530 --> 00:37:41,531
[muffled blowing sound]

527
00:37:41,656 --> 00:37:45,286
Frankie, are you tooting?
Is that you tooting?

528
00:37:45,409 --> 00:37:46,501
[repeats sound]

529
00:37:46,619 --> 00:37:49,042
Frankie... I can hear...

530
00:38:05,805 --> 00:38:08,604
I love you like crazy. I gotta go, OK?

531
00:38:08,683 --> 00:38:10,310
Kiss, kiss. [kissing sounds]

532
00:38:10,977 --> 00:38:12,274
Bye-bye.

533
00:38:20,027 --> 00:38:21,574
What are you doing?

534
00:38:24,407 --> 00:38:27,456
What? What's it look like I'm doing?

535
00:38:29,996 --> 00:38:31,794
Getting all wet and naked.

536
00:38:34,834 --> 00:38:37,303
I'm gonna go order some food.
Do you want some?

537
00:38:37,378 --> 00:38:38,925
You know what I like.

538
00:38:40,339 --> 00:38:41,932
Can you close the door?

539
00:38:57,523 --> 00:38:58,524
Oh.

540
00:39:05,865 --> 00:39:08,744
- What are you doing?
- What does it look like I'm doing?

541
00:39:32,642 --> 00:39:33,643
[mumbling]

542
00:40:09,845 --> 00:40:11,813
[Cindy] All right.

543
00:40:11,889 --> 00:40:13,232
Come up.

544
00:40:13,808 --> 00:40:15,105
Come up.

545
00:40:37,456 --> 00:40:39,458
[woman moaning]

546
00:40:42,461 --> 00:40:43,462
[beeping]

547
00:40:55,850 --> 00:40:57,477
What are you so grumpy about?

548
00:40:58,394 --> 00:41:00,271
Oh, I don't know. I don't know why.

549
00:41:03,983 --> 00:41:07,658
- [Cindy] Do you want a drink?
- [Dean] Yes, please.

550
00:41:09,155 --> 00:41:11,157
[J' Penny & the Quarters: You and Me]

551
00:43:09,942 --> 00:43:11,694
- Hey, how are you?
- Fine, thank you.

552
00:43:11,777 --> 00:43:13,871
You're Gramma.
It's great to meet you.

553
00:43:13,946 --> 00:43:15,698
Cindy, come on.

554
00:43:15,781 --> 00:43:19,001
Could you talk to me
for five minutes, please?

555
00:43:19,076 --> 00:43:20,749
I don't want to talk to you anymore.

556
00:43:20,828 --> 00:43:22,705
Gramma, you know you have
an amazing granddaughter?

557
00:43:22,788 --> 00:43:25,257
- Oh, of course I do.
- She's unbelievable.

558
00:43:26,125 --> 00:43:28,469
I got these for you.
Would you please take them?

559
00:43:31,297 --> 00:43:33,550
Cindy, come on,
would you give me five minutes?

560
00:43:33,632 --> 00:43:36,511
This is ridiculous.
You're not even gonna talk to me?

561
00:43:36,594 --> 00:43:38,437
Come on, Cindy.

562
00:43:39,221 --> 00:43:42,191
I'm trying to say I'm sorry,
and you're acting like a total bitch!

563
00:43:47,354 --> 00:43:49,402
[Dean] I don't know, I just
feel like I should just stop...

564
00:43:50,399 --> 00:43:52,993
You know, just stop thinking
about it, but I can't.

565
00:43:54,653 --> 00:43:58,954
Maybe I've seen too many movies,
you know, love at first sight.

566
00:43:59,575 --> 00:44:01,498
- Anyone call?
- No.

567
00:44:02,411 --> 00:44:03,754
Thanks.

568
00:44:03,829 --> 00:44:05,422
[Dean] What do you think
about love at first sight?

569
00:44:05,497 --> 00:44:07,090
You think you can love somebody
just by looking at 'em?

570
00:44:07,166 --> 00:44:08,884
- [Marshall] By looking at 'em?
- But the thing is, man,

571
00:44:08,959 --> 00:44:12,714
I felt like I knew her. You know?
You ever get that feeling?

572
00:44:12,796 --> 00:44:16,676
[Marshall] Yeah, like, you've seen her
before and you just know her...

573
00:44:17,343 --> 00:44:19,892
- Yeah.
- [Marshall] it's a feeling.

574
00:44:21,180 --> 00:44:23,683
But, actually,
you really don't know her.

575
00:44:25,517 --> 00:44:29,317
- Yeah, I probably... I don't, right?
- [Marshall] That's right.

576
00:44:31,231 --> 00:44:35,987
- I felt like I did, though.
- If you get a little pussy...

577
00:44:36,779 --> 00:44:39,282
...I think all the mental-ness
will go away from you.

578
00:44:39,365 --> 00:44:41,038
[Dean] You think
I'm too much in my head?

579
00:44:41,116 --> 00:44:42,459
Yeah, too much.

580
00:44:45,621 --> 00:44:47,464
[Marshall] You already know
where she live at, right?

581
00:44:47,539 --> 00:44:50,167
[Dean] No, she was just, like,
visiting her grandmother.

582
00:44:50,250 --> 00:44:53,550
[Marshall] So why don't you go back
to that grandmother...

583
00:44:53,629 --> 00:44:57,384
- ...and ask her where she lives?
- [Dean] I should go back, right?

584
00:44:57,508 --> 00:44:59,351
[Marshall] Yeah. if you like her; yeah.

585
00:44:59,426 --> 00:45:01,975
[Dean] She just seems different,
you know? I don't know.

586
00:45:02,054 --> 00:45:03,931
[Marshall] Wait. How different?

587
00:45:06,892 --> 00:45:09,771
[Dean] I don't know,
I just got a feeling about her.

588
00:45:12,064 --> 00:45:15,068
You know when a song comes on
and you just gotta dance?

589
00:45:49,768 --> 00:45:51,520
- Hi.
- [Gramma] Hi.

590
00:45:51,603 --> 00:45:53,731
Do you know
what happened to Walter?

591
00:45:53,814 --> 00:45:56,738
- Who?
- [Dean] Walter.

592
00:45:57,901 --> 00:46:02,122
He's the gentlemen that just moved in
across the hall about a month ago.

593
00:46:03,282 --> 00:46:06,331
I don't know anything
or anybody named Walter.

594
00:46:06,994 --> 00:46:07,995
Oh.

595
00:46:10,289 --> 00:46:11,586
OK.

596
00:46:12,541 --> 00:46:15,294
Hey, can I ask you something else?

597
00:46:17,129 --> 00:46:20,429
What's the story with that girl
that was in here like a month ago?

598
00:46:20,507 --> 00:46:21,884
The blonde, the young blonde?

599
00:46:21,967 --> 00:46:25,062
[Dean] I gave her my card,
but she never called me.

600
00:46:25,929 --> 00:46:27,397
What's her name ?

601
00:46:28,682 --> 00:46:30,559
- [Gramma] Cindy.
- [Dean] Cindy.

602
00:46:30,642 --> 00:46:34,192
- Will you tell her I say hi?
- [Gramma] OK. Why not.

603
00:46:43,113 --> 00:46:44,205
Shit.

604
00:47:16,522 --> 00:47:20,197
Do you think I could sit down,
because all these other seats are taken.

605
00:47:23,946 --> 00:47:26,074
- OK.
- Hey, thanks.

606
00:47:28,575 --> 00:47:30,452
You know, I just talked
to your grandmother.

607
00:47:32,329 --> 00:47:33,797
That sounds weird, huh?

608
00:47:33,872 --> 00:47:35,795
- Yeah.
- OK, let me put it into context.

609
00:47:35,874 --> 00:47:40,220
I went out there to see Walter,
who's not there anymore.

610
00:47:41,130 --> 00:47:43,132
That's why I talked to her.

611
00:47:43,215 --> 00:47:45,638
Do you know what happened
to that guy, Walter?

612
00:47:45,717 --> 00:47:48,311
Yeah, do you know what happened
to that guy, Walter?

613
00:47:48,762 --> 00:47:52,062
No, I don't know what happened
to that guy, Walter.

614
00:47:52,141 --> 00:47:53,484
What happened?

615
00:47:53,559 --> 00:47:54,731
[tsks]

616
00:47:57,771 --> 00:47:59,489
You gotta do it like that?

617
00:48:00,399 --> 00:48:02,993
- What do you expect?
- What do you mean?

618
00:48:03,068 --> 00:48:06,413
They're old.
Would you want to live like that?

619
00:48:06,488 --> 00:48:08,490
- Like what? In that home?
- [Cindy] Yeah.

620
00:48:08,574 --> 00:48:11,669
Well, no but I'm not getting old
and he's a dummy for dying.

621
00:48:12,661 --> 00:48:14,709
- [Cindy] Walter's a dummy for dying?
- Yeah.

622
00:48:14,788 --> 00:48:17,007
[Cindy] What are you gonna do,
wise guy?

623
00:48:17,082 --> 00:48:18,083
Not do it.

624
00:48:20,711 --> 00:48:23,590
- Are you gonna die?
- Definitely.

625
00:48:23,755 --> 00:48:24,756
Hmm?

626
00:48:26,133 --> 00:48:28,227
- What'd you say?
- I said definitely.

627
00:48:28,302 --> 00:48:30,304
Well, with that
kind of attitude, you will.

628
00:48:31,180 --> 00:48:33,228
Don't do it. it's for suckers.

629
00:48:34,224 --> 00:48:35,476
Don't do it.

630
00:48:36,268 --> 00:48:38,396
- [Cindy] What are you gonna do?
- Just not do it.

631
00:48:38,937 --> 00:48:40,655
I went out there to give him this.

632
00:48:40,731 --> 00:48:42,608
Isn't that nice? I found it.

633
00:48:43,609 --> 00:48:45,031
Look at that.

634
00:48:46,278 --> 00:48:48,121
- Is that him?
- Yeah, and his lady.

635
00:48:48,197 --> 00:48:50,950
- isn't he handsome?
- [Cindy] Look at her, she's so pretty.

636
00:48:51,867 --> 00:48:53,665
[Dean] So she's probably nuts, then.

637
00:48:56,163 --> 00:48:59,337
In my experience, the prettier
a girl is, the more nuts she is.

638
00:49:02,127 --> 00:49:04,095
Which makes you insane.

639
00:49:04,963 --> 00:49:07,637
You're probably nutty-coo-coo crazy.

640
00:49:11,803 --> 00:49:14,431
It's not your fault.
You know, it's just like...

641
00:49:15,057 --> 00:49:17,276
Everybody treats you different.

642
00:49:17,351 --> 00:49:20,230
Like, you make jokes and they're
not funny, but people laugh anyway.

643
00:49:20,312 --> 00:49:21,814
That's gotta make you nuts.

644
00:49:23,398 --> 00:49:27,119
I like how you can compliment
and insult somebody at the same time.

645
00:49:27,194 --> 00:49:28,696
In equal measure.

646
00:49:28,779 --> 00:49:30,497
What's an insult about that?

647
00:49:31,365 --> 00:49:33,333
That I'm crazy and I'm not funny.

648
00:49:33,408 --> 00:49:37,208
Well... I don't know if you're
not funny, tell me a joke.

649
00:49:38,997 --> 00:49:42,797
So there's a child molester
and a little boy walking into the woods.

650
00:49:42,918 --> 00:49:43,919
[Dean chuckles]

651
00:49:44,753 --> 00:49:48,803
The child molester and the little boy
keep walking further and further,

652
00:49:48,882 --> 00:49:51,510
and it's getting darker and darker
and they're going deeper and deeper

653
00:49:51,593 --> 00:49:53,812
into the woods and the child molester...

654
00:49:53,887 --> 00:49:57,016
...and the little boy looks up
at the child molester and he says,

655
00:49:57,099 --> 00:49:59,067
[high-pitched voice]
"Gee, mister, I'm getting scared!"

656
00:49:59,142 --> 00:50:00,985
And the child molester
looks down at him and says,

657
00:50:01,061 --> 00:50:04,190
"You think you're scared, kid?
I gotta walk outta here alone."

658
00:50:11,655 --> 00:50:13,407
You don't think that's funny?

659
00:50:16,076 --> 00:50:19,046
- No, I'm sorry.
- I do.

660
00:50:19,955 --> 00:50:22,458
[Dean] You get along
with your grandma, huh?

661
00:50:22,541 --> 00:50:24,259
Yeah, she makes me laugh.

662
00:50:25,877 --> 00:50:30,383
Nobody else talks in my family.
And when they talk, they just yell.

663
00:50:34,094 --> 00:50:36,722
[Dean] I'm never getting married.

664
00:50:37,681 --> 00:50:40,560
[Dean] This is a nice place, you live.
You like it?

665
00:50:41,268 --> 00:50:43,771
- It's all right.
- Where you wanna go?

666
00:50:45,105 --> 00:50:46,698
I wanna go away to school.

667
00:50:47,691 --> 00:50:50,740
- What are you gonna study?
- Medicine.

668
00:50:51,236 --> 00:50:53,705
[hissing] Really?

669
00:50:53,780 --> 00:50:55,703
- Yeah, really.
- Yeah, right.

01:02:50,566 --> 01:02:54,070
You want me to hit you?
I'm not gonna do it! I love you.

840
01:02:54,945 --> 01:02:56,162
- OK?
- [door knob jiggles]

841
01:02:56,238 --> 01:02:57,865
Let me out.

842
01:02:57,948 --> 01:02:58,949
[pounds on door]

843
01:02:59,116 --> 01:03:01,369
Open the door. Open the door.

844
01:03:01,452 --> 01:03:02,419
[pounding continues]

845
01:03:02,494 --> 01:03:03,837
Open the door.

846
01:03:04,622 --> 01:03:06,374
Open the door.

847
01:03:06,457 --> 01:03:08,926
Hey! Open this door!

848
01:03:09,001 --> 01:03:12,847
- [exhales heavily]
- Hey! Open the door!

849
01:03:14,131 --> 01:03:17,305
Open the door!

850
01:03:18,052 --> 01:03:19,395
Hey!

851
01:03:20,304 --> 01:03:22,056
Open the door!

852
01:03:23,557 --> 01:03:25,434
Can you open the door?

853
01:03:26,727 --> 01:03:28,354
Can you open the door?

854
01:03:29,563 --> 01:03:31,236
Go.

855
01:03:34,652 --> 01:03:36,654
[laughing]

856
01:03:42,451 --> 01:03:43,919
No. No!

857
01:03:52,836 --> 01:03:55,510
[laughing] OW... ow. OW.

858
01:03:58,008 --> 01:04:00,636
[Dean] What is going on? What kind
of operation are you running...

859
01:04:00,719 --> 01:04:02,346
- Stop.
- ...around here?

860
01:04:03,555 --> 01:04:04,932
OK.

861
01:04:12,106 --> 01:04:13,653
[Dean laughing]

862
01:04:16,193 --> 01:04:17,866
[Cindy yelling]

863
01:04:22,700 --> 01:04:25,249
[man] Do not touch
the young lady in my taxi!

864
01:04:25,786 --> 01:04:29,416
Please, sir!
Don't touch her back there, please?

865
01:04:29,498 --> 01:04:34,345
- Thank you! Thank you very much.
- Come on! Why not?

866
01:04:34,420 --> 01:04:37,469
Sir! Please there's no sex in my taxi!

867
01:04:37,548 --> 01:04:40,222
Do not touch the young lady in my taxi!

868
01:04:40,301 --> 01:04:42,679
I'll have you know that she was
putting the moves on me.

869
01:04:42,761 --> 01:04:45,890
That's not true.
Would you believe a face like this?

870
01:04:45,973 --> 01:04:48,476
- That doesn't...
- Look at that face. Look at that face.

871
01:04:48,559 --> 01:04:51,654
[man] I will not have you trying
something that's wrong in my car!

872
01:04:51,729 --> 01:04:52,855
What's wrong?

873
01:04:52,938 --> 01:04:55,032
[man] This is my car,
this is like my home.

874
01:04:55,107 --> 01:04:56,984
You're in my home now, OK?

875
01:04:57,067 --> 01:04:59,820
It's not my business
what you do with this girl,

876
01:04:59,903 --> 01:05:01,997
but you're not gonna do it in my cab.

877
01:05:17,546 --> 01:05:18,593
[exhales softly]

878
01:05:37,107 --> 01:05:38,575

881
01:05:59,296 --> 01:06:00,764
Oh, God.

882

[panting continues]

883
01:06:04,968 --> 01:06:06,720
God. Oh, no, no, no.

884
01:06:06,804 --> 01:06:09,057
No, no, no, no, no...

885
01:06:09,139 --> 01:06:10,561
No.

886
01:06:11,558 --> 01:06:13,777
[laughing]

887
01:06:17,481 --> 01:06:18,949
Oh, my God.

888
01:06:19,024 --> 01:06:21,743
Oh, my God, oh, my God.

889
01:06:28,742 --> 01:06:29,834
[Bobby] Good job.

890
01:06:48,804 --> 01:06:49,851
[undoes zipper]

891
01:06:50,347 --> 01:06:51,849
[urinating]

892
01:07:49,156 --> 01:07:50,658
[indistinct chattering]

893
01:08:00,459 --> 01:08:01,836
Hi.

894
01:08:09,468 --> 01:08:11,311
Hi.

895
01:08:14,223 --> 01:08:15,725
You OK?

896
01:08:16,600 --> 01:08:18,273
Yeah, you OK?

897
01:08:20,521 --> 01:08:22,364
Yeah, you OK?

898
01:08:27,945 --> 01:08:29,618
[Dean] You gonna talk to me or what?

899
01:08:30,948 --> 01:08:32,621
You gonna tell me what's goin' on?

900
01:08:36,411 --> 01:08:39,665
- You're not gonna tell me?
- I don't know what you want me to say.

901
01:08:39,748 --> 01:08:41,796
I want you to tell me what's going on.
I wanna know.

902
01:08:42,709 --> 01:08:44,757
You got me feeling sick, you know?

903
01:08:46,255 --> 01:08:47,928
I'm very intuitive.

904
01:08:49,341 --> 01:08:50,888
I know there's something up.

905
01:08:59,059 --> 01:09:01,562
- I don't know what to do.
- OK, you're not gonna tell me?

906
01:09:01,645 --> 01:09:02,737
[train passing]

907
01:09:02,813 --> 01:09:05,236
Stop! Stop, stop! No, no, no, stop!

908
01:09:05,315 --> 01:09:08,034
- You gonna tell me?
- Stop! Come down!

909
01:09:08,110 --> 01:09:10,329
- You gonna tell me?
- Just come down! I'm not kidding you!

910
01:09:10,404 --> 01:09:13,157
- You're gonna tell me what it is?
- Come... Please come down!

911
01:09:13,240 --> 01:09:15,117
Come down. Please... Please stop.

912
01:09:15,200 --> 01:09:17,669
- You want me to go over the edge?
- No, I want you to come down!

913
01:09:17,744 --> 01:09:19,542
- Tell me what it is.
- Come on, it's dangerous!

914
01:09:19,621 --> 01:09:21,623
- You gonna tell me?
- No!

915
01:09:21,707 --> 01:09:24,085
No, stop! Please come on!

916
01:09:24,167 --> 01:09:27,296
Please! I'm pregnant!
Stop, come back, please!

917
01:09:27,838 --> 01:09:30,682
Please come down. Please come down.

918
01:09:45,188 --> 01:09:46,531
Is it mine?

919
01:09:50,485 --> 01:09:52,863
- I don't know. I don't know.
- You don't know?

920
01:09:53,572 --> 01:09:54,869
Maybe.

921
01:09:55,449 --> 01:09:58,498
- Maybe?
- Probably not.

922
01:10:08,211 --> 01:10:09,758
What are you gonna do?

923
01:10:11,548 --> 01:10:13,721
- What am I gonna do?
- What are you gonna do?

924
01:10:15,260 --> 01:10:17,308
I don't know...

925
01:10:17,387 --> 01:10:19,936
You're gonna have it? You're not
gonna have it? What are you gonna do?

926
01:10:22,726 --> 01:10:24,728
- You thought about this?
- I don't know.

927
01:10:25,896 --> 01:10:27,364
You don't know?

928
01:10:32,653 --> 01:10:34,326
[Dean punches fence]

929
01:10:41,286 --> 01:10:45,541
[woman] You've opted for our
vacuum-aspiration abortion today.

930
01:10:45,624 --> 01:10:47,922
I'm just gonna ask you a few questions.

931
01:10:48,752 --> 01:10:53,178
They're sensitive in nature,
so if at any time, you're uncomfortable,

932
01:10:53,256 --> 01:10:55,099
you just let me know, OK?

933
01:10:58,136 --> 01:11:02,983
At what age were you
when you first had intercourse?

934
01:11:05,310 --> 01:11:07,938
- Thirteen.
- OK.

935
01:11:13,151 --> 01:11:15,028
That's not unusual.

936
01:11:15,946 --> 01:11:18,369
OK, and how many sexual partners

937
01:11:18,448 --> 01:11:21,952
would you say you've had
from when you first began?

938
01:11:27,499 --> 01:11:29,251
Maybe...

939
01:11:30,293 --> 01:11:32,796
...twenty... twenty...

940
01:11:33,505 --> 01:11:35,974
- ...twenty-five?
- GK.

941
01:11:36,425 --> 01:11:38,894
Do you know
which partner you were with

942
01:11:38,969 --> 01:11:41,142
at the time that you became pregnant?

943
01:11:41,805 --> 01:11:46,481
CK. And is that partner
supportive to you?

944
01:11:47,644 --> 01:11:48,645
Um...

945
01:11:51,314 --> 01:11:53,737
No. OK.

946
01:11:53,817 --> 01:11:56,115
[phone ringing]

947
01:12:02,075 --> 01:12:03,076
[inhaling deeply]

948
01:12:03,160 --> 01:12:06,664
[man] Good, all right, now I'm gonna
put my hand on your belly...

949
01:12:08,165 --> 01:12:10,293
...and then I'm gonna
introduce a finger.

950
01:12:10,375 --> 01:12:12,594
You're gonna feel it.
OK, there you are.

951
01:12:12,669 --> 01:12:14,546
- [groaning]
- [man] All right...

952
01:12:15,255 --> 01:12:17,178
That's it, OK, good.

953
01:12:17,257 --> 01:12:21,262
Deep breathing. That's it.
All right, I feel the uterus.

954
01:12:21,344 --> 01:12:25,315
Indeed, it's probably
11 and a half, 12 weeks.

955
01:12:25,390 --> 01:12:27,609
It's in a safe position
for the procedure.

956
01:12:27,684 --> 01:12:33,032
OK, I'm gonna insert a speculum.
it's gonna cause some pressure.

957
01:12:33,774 --> 01:12:35,902
Here it goes, this is it.

958
01:12:36,735 --> 01:12:39,989
That's it. I know it's uncomfortable.
I know it's uncomfortable.

959
01:12:40,071 --> 01:12:44,622
But as much as you can relax,
the easier it goes, OK.

960
01:12:44,701 --> 01:12:46,999
It's set right where I need to have it.

961
01:12:47,078 --> 01:12:50,082
Good work. Keep that breathing.

962
01:12:50,165 --> 01:12:52,418
- You're making me breathe hard.
- [woman] You're doing great.

963
01:12:52,501 --> 01:12:57,007
[man] The next thing I'm gonna do is I
want to give you some local anesthesia.

964
01:12:57,088 --> 01:12:59,637
It's a little uncomfortable,
so what I want you to do...

965
01:13:00,550 --> 01:13:02,598
Right now, I'm gonna
give you the first injection.

966
01:13:02,677 --> 01:13:04,679
Take a giant breath and cough.

967
01:13:04,763 --> 01:13:07,937
Go ahead. Breath... Cough.

968
01:13:09,392 --> 01:13:12,066
OK, fine, fine, fine.

969
01:13:12,145 --> 01:13:17,151
OK. I'm just gonna
put that down and let it take effect.

970
01:13:17,859 --> 01:13:22,706
Breathe deeply, slowly, deeply...

971
01:13:23,949 --> 01:13:26,168
What I'm gonna do
is apply an instrument,

972
01:13:26,243 --> 01:13:28,962
so I can hold the cervix still.

973
01:13:29,037 --> 01:13:31,586
Shouldn't feel this.
Maybe a little pressure.

974
01:13:31,665 --> 01:13:34,839
- I can't.
- [woman] Oh, sweetheart, are you OK?

975
01:13:34,918 --> 01:13:36,261
[man] Cindy?

976
01:13:36,878 --> 01:13:39,006
- Stop.
- [woman] OK. OK.

977
01:13:39,089 --> 01:13:42,059
- Stop.
- [man] OK, I'm sorry and I will stop.

978
01:13:42,968 --> 01:13:47,849
All right, you wanna sit up?
OK, all right.

979
01:13:47,931 --> 01:13:52,607
You want me to just stop
the whole procedure, is that correct?

980
01:13:52,686 --> 01:13:55,530
All right, I'm gonna step out.

981
01:13:55,605 --> 01:13:57,448
- Felicia...
- [Felicia] Yeah.

982
01:13:58,108 --> 01:14:01,282
- Do you wanna put your things back on?
- Can I see my...?

983
01:14:02,445 --> 01:14:05,244
- Can I see my friend?
- Sure, honey.

984
01:14:56,917 --> 01:14:58,339
Let's do it.

985
01:15:03,673 --> 01:15:05,425
Let's be a family.

986
01:15:18,396 --> 01:15:20,273
Let's be a family.

987
01:15:32,994 --> 01:15:35,213
[Cindy] You don't have to do this,
you know.

988
01:15:36,498 --> 01:15:38,296
It's not your fault.

989
01:15:40,543 --> 01:15:41,886
[Dean] I love you.

990
01:15:43,380 --> 01:15:45,382
I love you, too.

991

[phone ringing]

992
01:16:10,907 --> 01:16:14,411
Hey, it's me Cindy. Hi.

993
01:16:15,036 --> 01:16:16,834
We need you to come in...

994
01:16:16,913 --> 01:16:19,883
[groans] Who else did you call?

995
01:16:19,958 --> 01:16:23,588
- I called Janet, and I called...
- I'm out of town, too.

996
01:16:25,171 --> 01:16:27,674
What time is it? What time is it?

997
01:16:28,258 --> 01:16:31,057
Six, seven, eight, nine...

998
01:16:31,136 --> 01:16:32,479
Nine o'clock.

999
01:16:33,263 --> 01:16:36,893
If I'm there at nine?
I'm coming if I'm there at nine.

1000
01:17:30,820 --> 01:17:33,790
- [phone ringing]
- [Dean yawns]

1001
01:17:36,034 --> 01:17:40,164
[grumbles] Cindy!

1002
01:17:43,500 --> 01:17:45,127
Cin!

1003
01:17:46,211 --> 01:17:48,088
I'm gonna fuckin' kill her.

1004
01:17:49,089 --> 01:17:50,181
Yo.

1005
01:17:50,256 --> 01:17:52,384
[man on recording]
This is your 11:00am wake up call.

1006
01:17:52,467 --> 01:17:54,845
OK. Thank you.

1007
01:18:23,540 --> 01:18:24,757
Cin?

1008
01:18:48,565 --> 01:18:49,612
[sighs]

1010
01:18:56,447 --> 01:19:01,704
- [indistinct chattering]

[Bobby] I just want to say to you,
thanks for making all bets off

1014
01:19:44,579 --> 01:19:47,958
and for freeing me of my human decency.

1015
01:19:48,041 --> 01:19:50,260
All your shit is going in the trash.

1016
01:19:50,335 --> 01:19:52,679
All your books
are gonna get fucking ripped up.

1017
01:19:52,754 --> 01:19:55,382
You want to go to war? I mean,
we’ll go to wan we'll see who wins.

1018
01:19:55,465 --> 01:19:59,641
I know who the fucker is, OK?
And I'm gonna destroy him.

[Bobby] You probably don't even know
what you did.

1021
01:20:06,059 --> 01:20:08,562
I want you to hear something, OK?

1022
01:20:08,645 --> 01:20:12,320
I have never... I have never
cursed at a girl in my life.

1023
01:20:12,398 --> 01:20:13,570
Fuck you!

1024
01:20:14,359 --> 01:20:16,737
Fuck you, bitch!

1025
01:20:17,654 --> 01:20:19,452
Do you understand that?

1026
01:20:19,530 --> 01:20:23,535
I'm gonna find him
and I’m gonna fuck his ass up!

1027
01:20:23,618 --> 01:20:26,246
I hope he looks so beautiful to you...

1028
01:20:26,329 --> 01:20:30,425
I hope he looks so beautiful
to you when I'm done.

1029
01:20:30,500 --> 01:20:32,002
Do you hear me?

1035
01:21:15,586 --> 01:21:17,054
Hey.

1036
01:21:21,301 --> 01:21:24,396
Hey, I'm looking for Dean.

1037
01:21:25,054 --> 01:21:27,022
For Dean. I'm looking for Dean.
You know where he's at?

1038
01:21:27,098 --> 01:21:28,975
- Yeah, I'm Dean.
- Oh, OK.

1039
01:21:35,982 --> 01:21:38,531
[Bobby] Your little boy's
gonna call me Daddy from now on.

[indistinct shouting]

1041
01:21:57,503 --> 01:22:00,006
Fuck you! Bitch!

1042
01:22:00,089 --> 01:22:02,183
- [man] Such a little bitch. Pussy.
- Piece of shit!

1043
01:22:02,258 --> 01:22:05,307
- [man] Fuck him up.
- Bitch!

1044
01:22:05,762 --> 01:22:07,935
You fuckin' piece of shit!

1045
01:22:08,014 --> 01:22:09,436
Fucking pussy!

1046

[phone still ringing]

1047
01:22:39,545 --> 01:22:44,051
Dr. Feinberg's Office. Mm-hmm.
OK, when were you looking to come in?

1048
01:22:45,968 --> 01:22:48,062
Oh! Busy! Haven't sat down yet.

1049
01:22:48,137 --> 01:22:49,889
What do you have?
Can you walk with me?

1050
01:22:49,972 --> 01:22:53,351
I've got a woman in five, Hispanic...
Excuse me.

1051
01:22:53,434 --> 01:22:56,233
Doesn't speak much English, and she's
complaining of pain in her left breast.

1052
01:22:56,312 --> 01:22:59,862
All right, I'll be in in a minute.
Oh, hey, you know what I was thinking?

1053
01:22:59,941 --> 01:23:03,912
I realize it might be hard for you to
move the whole family up to Riverdale,

1054
01:23:03,986 --> 01:23:05,579
'cause your daughter's
still in school and everything,

1055
01:23:05,655 --> 01:23:08,078
and I thought maybe
you get an apartment.

1056
01:23:08,157 --> 01:23:10,910
You know, work during the week,
drive home on the weekends.

1057
01:23:12,412 --> 01:23:14,631
Wouldn't have to worry about being
lonely. We could hang out together.

1058
01:23:14,705 --> 01:23:16,503
You know, get dinner sometimes.

1059
01:23:18,668 --> 01:23:20,762
Anyway, that was not a proposition.

1060
01:23:20,837 --> 01:23:22,339
- It was just...
- I'm married.

1061
01:23:22,422 --> 01:23:25,676
Just trying to... Just trying to help.

1062
01:23:26,509 --> 01:23:29,388
I thought you wanted me there
because I'm good at my job.

1063
01:23:29,470 --> 01:23:30,847
Yeah, I thought...

1064
01:23:33,015 --> 01:23:35,768
Anyway... I'll see you in a minute.

1065
01:23:42,483 --> 01:23:45,487
[indistinct chattering]

1066
01:23:56,664 --> 01:23:58,962
I can't do that over the phone.
I can't do it over the phone.

1067
01:23:59,041 --> 01:24:00,133
Hold on, please.

1068
01:24:00,209 --> 01:24:04,464
Sir, could you just fill that out and
when you're done bring it back up to me?

1069
01:24:04,547 --> 01:24:06,641
[whispering] I don't need this.

1070
01:24:06,716 --> 01:24:08,514
Could you hold on just
one second, please?

1071
01:24:08,593 --> 01:24:10,595
- OK, thank you.
- I was looking for my wife.

1072
01:24:11,512 --> 01:24:14,732
- I don't need that.
- OK, and who is your wife?

1073
01:24:14,807 --> 01:24:18,402
- Cynthia.
- Oh, you must be Dean.

1074
01:24:19,145 --> 01:24:23,491
OK, yeah, let me get her,
she'll be right with you.

1075
01:24:25,860 --> 01:24:28,784
[woman] Cindy, sweetie,
you have a visitor.

1076
01:24:29,697 --> 01:24:31,916
- [Cindy] Who?
- it's your husband.

1077
01:24:31,991 --> 01:24:35,461
- [Cindy exhales]
- [woman] I think he's been drinking.

1078
01:24:39,665 --> 01:24:43,886
- Hi.
- Oh, there you are.

1079
01:24:43,961 --> 01:24:45,804
What are you doing here?

1080
01:24:46,797 --> 01:24:49,641
Oh, well, you're awful friendly
right now, aren't ya?

1081
01:24:50,384 --> 01:24:54,014
- No, I'm just surprised to see you.
- Oh, this is where the smiles happen.

1082
01:24:54,096 --> 01:24:56,599
This the smile room? Huh?

1083
01:24:57,808 --> 01:25:00,027
You take off, you leave me,
you don't tell me what's going on?

1084
01:25:00,102 --> 01:25:03,732
I was so goddamn worried, I thought
something might of happened to Frankie!

1085
01:25:03,814 --> 01:25:06,283
- I don't know what the hell happened.
- Meems, can you give me a few?

1086
01:25:06,359 --> 01:25:07,827
- You just take off like that?
- I'll be right here if you need me.

1087
01:25:07,902 --> 01:25:09,700
Yeah, Meems, can you give her a few?

1088
01:25:09,779 --> 01:25:11,656
I don't know if there's an emergency...
You're just gone!

1089
01:25:11,739 --> 01:25:14,583
- Frankie's fine. Come on, lets go.
- Well, good to know.

1090
01:25:14,659 --> 01:25:16,286
Cindy, I'm here if you need me.

1091
01:25:16,369 --> 01:25:18,792
- OK, come on, let's go.
- Don't let him brainwash you.

1092
01:25:18,871 --> 01:25:21,420
- Can you give me a hand with this?
- "Don't let him brainwash you"?

1093
01:25:21,499 --> 01:25:23,297
Can you give me a hand?

1094
01:25:23,834 --> 01:25:25,427
Oh, God...

1095
01:25:33,761 --> 01:25:36,765
Look, OK, I know everything
got fucked up last night.

1096
01:25:37,974 --> 01:25:39,021
OK?

1097
01:25:39,100 --> 01:25:40,226
Can't believe you'd show up here drunk.

1098
01:25:40,309 --> 01:25:42,403
Hey, I'm talking to you!

1099
01:25:43,145 --> 01:25:46,240
- Hey. I know that...
- Can you drive?

1100
01:25:46,315 --> 01:25:48,317
- What?
- I said can you drive?

1101
01:25:48,401 --> 01:25:50,449
What do you mean?
What kinda question is that?

1102
01:25:50,528 --> 01:25:52,246
Of course I can drive.
I know how to drive...

1103
01:25:52,321 --> 01:25:54,369
Take the keys, go home.

1104
01:25:54,448 --> 01:25:56,746
You don't even care
if I fuckin' can drive.

1105
01:25:56,826 --> 01:25:58,794
You'd love it if I got in
a goddamned accident.

1106
01:25:58,869 --> 01:26:01,497
Yeah, I'd love it.
I'd just love it, you're so right.

1107
01:26:01,581 --> 01:26:04,130
[Dean] That's the point. You don't
have any goddamned time anymore.

1108
01:26:04,208 --> 01:26:05,835
It all goes to this fucking place.

1109
01:26:05,918 --> 01:26:08,421
And these fucking people
don't give a shit about you.

1110
01:26:08,504 --> 01:26:11,428
- Do they? Hey!
- Just go home!

1111
01:26:11,507 --> 01:26:13,225
[Dean] Hey, come here for a second,
I'm gonna come in there!

1112
01:26:13,301 --> 01:26:17,306
I'm gonna come in!
All right, I'm coming.

1113
01:26:21,142 --> 01:26:23,941
Just have a seat and we'll be
with you as soon as we can, OK?

1114
01:26:24,020 --> 01:26:25,522
Thank you.

1115
01:26:25,605 --> 01:26:30,076
- Are you OK? Is he gone?
- [Cindy] I fucking hate him.

1116
01:26:33,029 --> 01:26:34,656
[Meems] Why don't you just give her
a couple of minutes?

1117
01:26:34,739 --> 01:26:36,457
No. Dean, you can't come back here.

1118
01:26:36,532 --> 01:26:38,125
- [Cindy] Oh, God.
- Dean...

1119
01:26:39,744 --> 01:26:42,497
- [Meems] You can't be back here.
- It's OK, you're OK.

1120
01:26:43,623 --> 01:26:45,796
[Cindy] I can't do this,
I can't take this shit.

1121
01:26:45,875 --> 01:26:48,128
- Come outside with me.
- Dean, I cannot take this shit anymore.

1122
01:26:48,210 --> 01:26:50,008
- Just come outside.
- I cannot take this shit.

1123
01:26:50,087 --> 01:26:53,057
I am not going outside with you.
I've had it!

1124
01:26:53,132 --> 01:26:55,134
- I've had it. I've had it.
- Come and talk to me...

1125
01:26:55,217 --> 01:26:58,061
I am up to here!
I'm done, OK? I'm done!

1126
01:26:58,137 --> 01:26:59,855
- Let's go outside...
- I'm done. I'm done.

1127
01:26:59,930 --> 01:27:02,399
Look, no... I am done. I am done.

1128
01:27:02,475 --> 01:27:05,445
I'm done with this.
I'm done being angry like this.

1129
01:27:05,519 --> 01:27:07,647
I'm done having you drunk like this.
I am done!

1130
01:27:07,730 --> 01:27:10,153
- Don't close that door!
- I'm closing the door.

1131
01:27:10,232 --> 01:27:12,155
- Don't...
- Don't talk like that.

1132
01:27:12,234 --> 01:27:14,282
- Mimi...
- Hey, don't talk to Mimi.

1133
01:27:14,362 --> 01:27:17,115
Hey, Mimi, you know what?
We're gonna take a little minute.

1134
01:27:17,198 --> 01:27:18,950
We're just gonna take a second.

1135
01:27:19,033 --> 01:27:21,331
You know what,
this is why I don't talk to you.

1136
01:27:21,410 --> 01:27:23,504
'Cause you go from here to here
in no time at all.

1137
01:27:23,579 --> 01:27:25,832
This is why you talk to me.
Because I'm here.

1138
01:27:25,915 --> 01:27:27,667
This is the only reason
you're talking to me.

1139
01:27:27,750 --> 01:27:30,845
- You fuckin' asshole.
- I'm a fuckin' asshole?

1140
01:27:30,920 --> 01:27:32,593
I'm so out of love with you.

1141
01:27:32,672 --> 01:27:35,471
I've got nothing left for you,
nothing, nothing!

1142
01:27:36,258 --> 01:27:39,603
Nothing! There is nothing here for you!
There is nothing here for you!

1143
01:27:39,679 --> 01:27:43,354
- I don't love you. I don't...
- Don't say stuff you can't take back.

1144
01:27:43,432 --> 01:27:46,311
[Cindy] You fucking asked for it, you
asked me. You asked me. I talk to you.

1145
01:27:46,394 --> 01:27:47,862
I couldn't drive you crazy
unless I love you.

1146
01:27:47,937 --> 01:27:50,235
I gave you the goddamn answer
and you don't like it.

1147
01:27:50,314 --> 01:27:51,736
- Are you gonna hit me?
- That's why I don't talk to you.

1148
01:27:51,816 --> 01:27:52,863
No, I'm not gonna hit you.

1149
01:27:52,942 --> 01:27:54,819
- You're the bad guy, not me, asshole.
- I'm the bad guy?

1150
01:27:54,902 --> 01:27:57,530
- Yeah, asshole!
- OK.

1151
01:27:57,613 --> 01:27:59,286
Fuck you! Fuck you!

1152
01:27:59,365 --> 01:28:01,367
Yeah, I'm more man than you are,
you fucking cunt.

1153
01:28:01,450 --> 01:28:03,703
- Don't say that shit about being a man.
- I am, I am. I can handle it.

1154
01:28:03,786 --> 01:28:05,788
What is it with this shit
and being a man? What is that?

1155
01:28:05,871 --> 01:28:06,963
What does it even mean?

1156
01:28:07,039 --> 01:28:08,916
- What is that?
- What does it mean?

1157
01:28:08,999 --> 01:28:12,048
- What does it mean to be a man?
- You're scaring us, you're scaring us!

1158
01:28:12,128 --> 01:28:15,052
- It doesn't mean you can come here...
- Don't say that stuff.

1159
01:28:15,131 --> 01:28:17,850
- "Be a man!" What is that shit?
- I mean, don't bully...

1160
01:28:17,925 --> 01:28:20,053
I'll be a man.
You want me to be a man? Here you go.

1161
01:28:20,136 --> 01:28:22,059
- Is this what men do?
- Oh, just stop it.

1162
01:28:22,138 --> 01:28:24,232
- I'm a big man!
- [Meems] Get out!

1163
01:28:24,306 --> 01:28:26,729
- Get out. Stop it!
- Look at me, I'm a big fucking man!

1164
01:28:26,809 --> 01:28:28,402
- I'm being a man!
- No, I'm the man!

1165
01:28:28,477 --> 01:28:30,070
- I'm being a man now.
- Stop it! Stop it, now.

1166
01:28:30,146 --> 01:28:32,524
- Stop it! Stop it!
- Hold on. This is what men do.

1167
01:28:32,606 --> 01:28:35,234
I'm tired of talking.
I'm fucking tired of talking.

1168
01:28:35,317 --> 01:28:37,194
- Hey, hey...
- Stop it!

1169
01:28:37,278 --> 01:28:39,121
Excuse me! Excuse me!

1170
01:28:39,196 --> 01:28:41,915
- What are you doing?!
- [Cindy] He's being an asshole.

1171
01:28:41,991 --> 01:28:43,618
- Hey, stop!
- Who are you, by the way?

1172
01:28:43,701 --> 01:28:44,918
- Hey, take it easy.
- Who are you?

1173
01:28:44,994 --> 01:28:46,746
Who am I? I'm a doctor.
I'm Dr. Feinberg.

1174
01:28:46,829 --> 01:28:50,299
You're fuckin' Dr. Feinberg?
You've been e-mailing my wife?

1175
01:28:50,374 --> 01:28:52,547
- Excuse me?
- You're the guy e-mailing my wife?

1176
01:28:52,626 --> 01:28:54,674
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God! Stop it!

1177
01:28:54,754 --> 01:28:57,098
Don't! Don't! Don't!

1178
01:28:57,173 --> 01:28:59,426
- I'm gonna hit you in five seconds.
- No one is hitting anybody.

1179
01:28:59,508 --> 01:29:00,885
I'm gonna hit you in five seconds...

1180
01:29:00,968 --> 01:29:03,141
- I'm gonna hit you in five seconds!
- Mimi, call the cops.

1181
01:29:03,220 --> 01:29:05,268
- Five! Four!
- They're coming!

1182
01:29:05,347 --> 01:29:07,315
- Will you take it easy?
- Get out!

1183
01:29:07,391 --> 01:29:09,644
- Get out!
- Take it outside, my friend!

1184
01:29:09,727 --> 01:29:11,946
- Two!
- Think about your wife, will you?

1185
01:29:13,564 --> 01:29:16,238
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
- You fucking son of a bitch!

1186
01:29:16,317 --> 01:29:19,696
- I'm sorry... Look...
- I'm so sorry!

1187
01:29:19,779 --> 01:29:22,123
- I'm so sorry.
- Buddy, get up. Just get up.

1188
01:29:22,198 --> 01:29:23,245
What the fuck is the matter with you?

1189
01:29:23,324 --> 01:29:25,668
You got a glass jaw or something?
You can't take one hit?

1190
01:29:25,743 --> 01:29:27,120
- All right, that's enough!
- it's one hit!

1191
01:29:27,203 --> 01:29:28,705
What is wrong with you?

1192
01:29:28,788 --> 01:29:30,916
Oh, my God, you fucking son of a bitch!

1193
01:29:30,998 --> 01:29:32,750
You fucking asshole!

1194
01:29:32,833 --> 01:29:34,176
I'm gonna kill you!

1195
01:29:34,251 --> 01:29:35,878
- You son of a bitch!
- That's enough.

1196
01:29:35,961 --> 01:29:37,429
You son of a bitch!

1197
01:29:37,505 --> 01:29:39,678
- I fucking hate you!
- [Feinberg] You two, break it up.

1198
01:29:39,757 --> 01:29:41,475
- That's enough.
- Stop it! Don't. Don't.

1199
01:29:41,550 --> 01:29:42,802
[Feinberg] Mimi, please!

1200
01:29:42,885 --> 01:29:45,889
Cindy, would you get out
of here? You are done here, get out!

1201
01:29:45,971 --> 01:29:47,473
- Get out! You're done!
- [Cindy] I'm trying to take him!

1202
01:29:47,556 --> 01:29:50,309
She's done?! You're gonna fire my wife?!

1203
01:29:50,851 --> 01:29:53,695
Hey! This is between
you and me, motherfucker.

1204
01:29:53,771 --> 01:29:55,489
Don't you fucking
blame her for that shit!

1205
01:29:55,564 --> 01:29:57,942
- Yeah, you're going to jail, my friend.
- I'm going to jail?

1206
01:29:58,025 --> 01:30:01,074
- [Cindy] Please, come with me!
- [Meems] Just get the hell out of here!

1207
01:30:01,153 --> 01:30:03,326
- [Feinberg] That's it. Keep moving!
- Come on!

1208
01:30:10,538 --> 01:30:12,040
Give me the keys.

1209
01:30:16,585 --> 01:30:18,258
I fucking want a divorce!

1210
01:30:41,735 --> 01:30:42,736
[ring bouncing]

1211
01:30:48,742 --> 01:30:50,836
Where are you going?!

1212
01:30:52,121 --> 01:30:53,964
What the fuck are you doing!?

1213
01:30:59,336 --> 01:31:00,337
[car door shuts]

1214
01:31:30,534 --> 01:31:31,911
[doorbell rings]

1215
01:31:36,749 --> 01:31:38,001
- Hey.
- Mr. Heller.

1216
01:31:38,083 --> 01:31:39,710
- You must be Dean.
- Yeah.

1217
01:31:40,294 --> 01:31:43,264
I didn't know if it was pot luck,
so I brought an eggplant.

1218
01:31:44,173 --> 01:31:46,926
- Very funny. Come in.
- Thank you.

1219
01:31:54,224 --> 01:31:55,441
Let me see. Let me see.

1220
01:31:55,517 --> 01:31:56,894
I don't know what you're talking about.
See what?

1221
01:31:56,977 --> 01:31:58,445
- Let me see.
- See me through the flowers?

1222
01:31:58,520 --> 01:32:00,522
- Do you like 'em?
- Oh, babe.

1223
01:32:03,400 --> 01:32:05,027
- Does it hurt?
- Yeah.

1224
01:32:05,110 --> 01:32:06,532
Like right now, when you're doing that.

1225
01:32:06,612 --> 01:32:08,080
- Sorry!
- Yeah.

1226
01:32:08,656 --> 01:32:11,500
Cindy doesn't usually bring
her boyfriends home for dinner.

1227
01:32:12,284 --> 01:32:15,879
So... I'm thinking
this might be serious.

1228
01:32:15,955 --> 01:32:18,708
[Gramma chuckles]

1229
01:32:18,791 --> 01:32:20,885
- [woman] Don't listen to him.
- Well, I hope so.

1230
01:32:22,503 --> 01:32:24,631
- You hope so.
- Yes, sir.

1231
01:32:24,713 --> 01:32:28,217
-Mmmm
- I mean, I'm pretty serious.

1232
01:32:30,302 --> 01:32:32,225
What do your folks do, Dean?

1233
01:32:32,304 --> 01:32:34,773
Well... I don't know...

1234
01:32:34,848 --> 01:32:39,399
My mother, I don't know,
to be honest, what she does.

1235
01:32:40,020 --> 01:32:42,990
But my father is a janitor...

1236
01:32:44,066 --> 01:32:47,036
...and he's a very talented musician.

1237
01:32:47,820 --> 01:32:50,323
- [woman] What does he play?
- Everything.

1238
01:32:50,406 --> 01:32:53,660
He can kind of play
a little bit of everything.

1239
01:32:53,742 --> 01:32:55,665
He's one of those people.

1240
01:32:56,745 --> 01:32:59,373
- [woman] So you don't see your mother?
- No, I don't.

1241
01:32:59,456 --> 01:33:01,675
[woman] Why?
Not that it's my business...

1242
01:33:01,750 --> 01:33:04,424
No, I understand you asking.

1243
01:33:06,171 --> 01:33:08,765
I don't really talk about it very often,
to be honest.

1244
01:33:10,426 --> 01:33:12,520
You know, she just...

1245
01:33:12,594 --> 01:33:17,691
When I was ten, she...
my father and her just decided

1246
01:33:17,766 --> 01:33:21,862
that it wasn't, you know, gonna work out

1247
01:33:21,937 --> 01:33:24,110
and she...

1248
01:33:24,189 --> 01:33:26,863
...she met somebody, and I think...

1249
01:33:28,402 --> 01:33:29,824
...that was that.

1250
01:33:31,530 --> 01:33:33,532
[Mr. Heller] You graduate
from high school, Dean?

1251
01:33:33,615 --> 01:33:36,084
Well, sir, no, I didn't, I didn't.

1252
01:33:37,202 --> 01:33:39,000
But, you know, I didn't feel like...

1253
01:33:39,079 --> 01:33:41,628
...there was a place for me there,
to be honest.

1254
01:33:41,707 --> 01:33:45,928
I don't think that high school
is all it's cracked up to be.

1255
01:33:49,506 --> 01:33:52,134
[woman] Cindy's... studying.

1256
01:33:53,761 --> 01:33:57,391
- I know. She's...
- it's exciting.

1257
01:33:57,473 --> 01:34:00,192
She's about the smartest person
I ever met.

1258
01:34:00,934 --> 01:34:02,311
How's it going?

1259
01:34:04,313 --> 01:34:05,860
- It's good.
- Yeah?

1260
01:34:05,939 --> 01:34:08,567
Mm-hmm. It's really good. Um...

1261
01:34:09,693 --> 01:34:14,824
There's one teacher in particular that
I've really enjoyed getting to know.

1262
01:34:16,658 --> 01:34:19,662
She says that I have a lot of potential.

1263
01:34:19,745 --> 01:34:21,122
What's her name?

1264
01:34:21,747 --> 01:34:23,795
- Professor Comstock.
- Comstock!

1265
01:34:23,874 --> 01:34:28,926
- [Dean laughs]
- What's so funny about that?

1266
01:34:29,713 --> 01:34:31,886
Teachers, they just always
have these names you know?

1267
01:34:31,965 --> 01:34:37,096
It's never like... I don't know...
They always have these names. Comstock.

1268
01:34:37,179 --> 01:34:39,273
- Is that funny?
- Yeah.

1269
01:34:39,348 --> 01:34:41,851
I don't know why, sorry. So you...

1270
01:34:41,934 --> 01:34:46,405
- What course is that?
- it's a biology course.

1271
01:34:48,023 --> 01:34:49,445
That's good.

1272
01:34:49,525 --> 01:34:51,027
[Mr. Heller] Cindy wants to be a doctor.

1273
01:34:53,654 --> 01:34:55,281
I know, that's...

1274
01:34:55,364 --> 01:34:58,493
She'd be a great doctor.
I wish she'd be my doctor.

1275
01:35:00,202 --> 01:35:01,795
I'd trust her.

1276
01:35:01,870 --> 01:35:04,419
A lot of these doctors,
they're just in it for the money.

1277
01:35:04,498 --> 01:35:07,422
It would make me relieved to know
that someone like Cindy

1278
01:35:07,501 --> 01:35:09,970
was my doctor, or my kid's doctor.

1279
01:35:10,879 --> 01:35:14,554
[woman] She's got a lot ahead of her.
it's really exciting.

1280
01:35:17,719 --> 01:35:21,394
- You know I'm not good enough for you.
- Stop it.

1281
01:35:21,473 --> 01:35:22,816
- it's true.
- Stop it.

1282
01:35:22,891 --> 01:35:24,643
- Baby, it's true.
- No, it's not.

1283
01:35:24,726 --> 01:35:27,149
- It is true.
- You're hurting my feelings.

1284
01:35:27,229 --> 01:35:29,072
- Don't say that.
- No, but nobody is.

1285
01:35:30,315 --> 01:35:35,663
You know, so as long as...
that's the case, I want the job.

1286
01:35:38,448 --> 01:35:39,449
[moaning]

1287
01:35:41,618 --> 01:35:42,744
[Dean] Baby...

1288
01:35:43,412 --> 01:35:45,085
- What?
- I got you a present.

1289
01:35:46,915 --> 01:35:49,384
That's it. Hold on... Boom!

1290
01:35:50,252 --> 01:35:53,005
- Oh, baby...
- Mmm?

1291
01:35:53,881 --> 01:35:55,224
Did you make it?

1292
01:35:55,299 --> 01:35:58,143
Well, I didn't make it,
but I got us a song.

1293
01:35:59,761 --> 01:36:02,139
You know, like our song
that will just be for you and me.

1294
01:36:04,474 --> 01:36:08,195
Because everybody's got songs, but
they're lame and they all share them.

1295
01:36:08,270 --> 01:36:10,113
You know, it's disgusting.

1296
01:36:10,731 --> 01:36:13,575
- Not us. We have our own song.
- We have our own song.

1297
01:36:14,568 --> 01:36:17,071
- What is it?
- Do you wanna listen to it?

1298
01:36:23,327 --> 01:36:25,500
[? Penny & the Quarters: You and Me]

1299
01:36:26,038 --> 01:36:27,631
[Dean] OK, turn it up.

1300
01:36:30,918 --> 01:36:34,343
- Stop it.
- Take it easy.

1301
01:36:35,839 --> 01:36:37,136
Listen.

1302
01:36:52,272 --> 01:36:56,948
[Dean starts singing along]

1303
01:38:03,719 --> 01:38:06,893
Baby! Hi!

1304
01:38:09,391 --> 01:38:10,938
Look at you.

1305
01:38:12,227 --> 01:38:13,228
[sighs]

1306
01:38:18,859 --> 01:38:20,076
[Dean] Oh...

1307
01:38:20,652 --> 01:38:21,653
[grunts]

1308
01:38:22,738 --> 01:38:24,160
Hi.

1309
01:38:25,907 --> 01:38:28,205
- Are you OK?
- I don't want to talk to you.

1310
01:38:36,752 --> 01:38:38,504
I can't play right now, OK?

1311
01:38:41,256 --> 01:38:43,133
What's going on, Dean?

1312
01:38:44,092 --> 01:38:45,093
[Dean sighs]

1313
01:38:45,927 --> 01:38:47,270
Dean, leave her alone.

1314
01:38:50,932 --> 01:38:54,311
Hey! You can't lock me
out of my own house!

1315
01:38:55,187 --> 01:38:58,191
I don't have my oxygen out here! Hey!

1316
01:39:30,639 --> 01:39:32,186
You know, it's not just us.

1317
01:39:32,265 --> 01:39:34,563
We got a little girl
we gotta think about.

1318
01:39:39,314 --> 01:39:42,659
[Cindy] I know, I am thinking about her.

1319
01:39:48,156 --> 01:39:49,908
I can't do this anymore.

1320
01:39:55,372 --> 01:39:58,672
[Dean] Baby, you're just thinking
about yourself. What about Frankie?

1321
01:40:01,420 --> 01:40:03,343
You want her to grow up
in a broken home?

1322
01:40:04,881 --> 01:40:08,511
- Is that what you want?
- I am thinking about Frankie.

1323
01:40:09,302 --> 01:40:10,519
[Dean] You're not
thinking about Frankie.

1324
01:40:10,637 --> 01:40:12,810
- I am thinking about...
- No, you're not.

1325
01:40:17,227 --> 01:40:19,400
Is this how you want her to grow up?

1326
01:40:20,188 --> 01:40:21,610
[Cindy] I don't want her
to grow up in a home

1327
01:40:21,690 --> 01:40:24,159

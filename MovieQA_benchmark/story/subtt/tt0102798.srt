1
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:48,495
Poacher!

2
00:03:48,562 --> 00:03:50,701
Stop the poacher!

3
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:25,255
<i>There he goes!</i>

4
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:38,545
Catch the poacher!

5
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:42,472
Ten marks for the man who catches the beast.

6
00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:55,247
After him! Get him!

7
00:04:55,314 --> 00:04:57,486
Get him!

8
00:05:00,498 --> 00:05:02,800
Get him!

9
00:05:24,562 --> 00:05:27,628
- It's Much the miller, come flying out of the forest.
- What's the hurry?

10
00:05:29,554 --> 00:05:33,809
<i>Sir Robert, save me.
Save me.</i>

11
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:39,501
Straight ahead!

12
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:43,148
Come on!
We got him! Come on!

13
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:46,479
<i>Go on! Go on!</i>

14
00:05:57,138 --> 00:05:59,505
Whoa. Whoa.
Whoa, there.

15
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:01,425
Steady. Steady.
Steady.

16
00:06:11,314 --> 00:06:13,202
What have we here,
Mr. Miter?

17
00:06:13,266 --> 00:06:17,805
Much here is the local miller, but he's been
grinding more than corn for his living.

18
00:06:17,874 --> 00:06:20,209
That's the poacher,
Sir Miles.

19
00:06:20,274 --> 00:06:23,176
Ah. Not so new at
the poaching game either.

20
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:26,545
Do you know the punishment
for poaching the king's deer twice?

21
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:29,425
- They can put my eyes out.
- Do something.

22
00:06:33,426 --> 00:06:35,433
<i>- Leave him.
- Who do you think you are?</i>

23
00:06:35,506 --> 00:06:38,157
- This man is a poacher.
- On my land.

24
00:06:38,226 --> 00:06:40,681
I have no objection
to this man hunting on my land.

25
00:06:40,754 --> 00:06:43,023
<i>He's a useful member
of our community.</i>

26
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:45,392
Who exactly are you?

27
00:06:46,578 --> 00:06:48,586
I am Sir Miles Folcanet...

28
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:51,822
and I'm the guest of the Baron Daguerre
to whom this land belongs...

29
00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:54,476
and certainly not
to some scruffy Saxon.

30
00:06:54,546 --> 00:06:57,328
You and your people may have
stolen every decent acre of my country...

31
00:06:57,394 --> 00:06:59,499
<i>and built your
mighty castles on them...</i>

32
00:06:59,570 --> 00:07:01,425
but I am still
Sir Robert Hode.

33
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:03,345
I am still
the Earl of Huntingdon...

34
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:06,923
and this land you are on
still belongs to me.

35
00:07:06,994 --> 00:07:09,896
Only as a vassal
to your feudal overlord...

36
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:12,523
and my host,
the Baron Daguerre.

37
00:07:12,594 --> 00:07:15,147
<i>But you're Sir Robert Hode,
of course.</i>

38
00:07:15,218 --> 00:07:18,252
<i>I hear you're
Baron Daguerre's friend.</i>

39
00:07:18,322 --> 00:07:21,104
What was the phrase,
"his little pet"?

40
00:07:25,842 --> 00:07:28,941
I order you
to leave this man be...

41
00:07:29,010 --> 00:07:31,115
and to get off my land.

42
00:07:31,186 --> 00:07:33,837
Well, well.

43
00:07:33,906 --> 00:07:36,110
Leave him be.

44
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:40,337
Yes, of course.
We could do as you suggest...

45
00:07:40,402 --> 00:07:44,079
but the poacher would still have his eyes
to help him poach again, would he not?

46
00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:51,184
And you, kind lady?

47
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:54,316
Is it your pleasure
that the miller should lose his eyes?

48
00:07:54,386 --> 00:07:58,412
My pleasures are my secret,
Sir Robert.

49
00:07:58,482 --> 00:08:01,865
I do not reveal them to just
any knight who crosses my path.

50
00:08:01,938 --> 00:08:04,425
Enough. There's a law.
Miter!

51
00:08:04,498 --> 00:08:06,954
Let him go.

52
00:08:07,025 --> 00:08:09,327
Why don't you and your men
hunt down some little children...

53
00:08:09,394 --> 00:08:11,761
that have been sniffing
the king's flowers?

54
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:14,214
You can pluck their
noses off one by one.

55
00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:18,000
<i>And you,
you can watch.</i>

56
00:08:18,066 --> 00:08:21,579
Much, walk away.

57
00:08:24,338 --> 00:08:26,225
Very well.
I shall let him go.

58
00:08:26,290 --> 00:08:31,308
Thank you, Sir Robert,
for your lesson in Saxon justice.

59
00:08:31,378 --> 00:08:33,201
On Monday morning
at 7:00...

60
00:08:33,266 --> 00:08:35,153
you will stand before
Baron Daguerre...

61
00:08:35,218 --> 00:08:38,830
and I'll make sure you'll taste
our Norman justice.

62
00:08:38,898 --> 00:08:41,287
You have insulted his guest.

63
00:08:43,153 --> 00:08:45,739
He will not
treat you lightly.

64
00:08:51,441 --> 00:08:53,711
Maybe you shouldn't
have said anything.

65
00:09:18,834 --> 00:09:21,298
<i>That's what he called you?</i>

66
00:09:21,426 --> 00:09:24,525
- My pet?
- The Baron Daguerre's little pet.

67
00:09:24,594 --> 00:09:26,699
What's so funny?

68
00:09:26,770 --> 00:09:29,934
I thought all you cared about
was the next wench and the next drink.

69
00:09:30,002 --> 00:09:32,849
And you defied Miles
for a half-dead Saxon poacher.

70
00:09:32,914 --> 00:09:35,151
I'd love to have
seen his face.

71
00:09:35,218 --> 00:09:37,073
I think I spoiled his fun.

72
00:09:37,138 --> 00:09:41,262
He was lusting to put the poor man's
eyes out personally on the spot.

73
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:43,566
Norman justice,
he called it.

74
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:49,836
I have to order you to be flogged
next Monday morning.

75
00:09:51,826 --> 00:09:55,273
You can't do that.
I am an earl.

76
00:09:55,346 --> 00:09:59,569
Climb down from
your high horse, Robert.

77
00:09:59,634 --> 00:10:02,700
- I'll try to avoid it.
- Try?

78
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:05,640
Folcanet wants
his entertainment.

79
00:10:05,713 --> 00:10:09,096
- You made him look a fool.
- You will never have me flogged.

80
00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:13,545
Need I remind you that while your grandfather's
father was no more than a pirate...

81
00:10:13,618 --> 00:10:16,269
my great-grandfather
was chancellor to our king?

82
00:10:16,338 --> 00:10:19,654
Did I tell you that?

83
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:23,145
It's true. A pirate.

84
00:10:26,866 --> 00:10:29,735
But that was
in confidence, Robert.

85
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:31,665
You will never say that
in public.

86
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:34,697
Never.
Your throw.

87
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:38,185
I, too, have my pride.

88
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:46,065
Hello, Marian.

89
00:10:49,842 --> 00:10:53,191
<i>- Who's winning, Uncle?
- Robert, of course.</i>

90
00:10:53,265 --> 00:10:55,273
<i>Have you met?</i>

91
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:00,719
I believe Sir Robert
never loses...

92
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:03,502
so he tells me.

93
00:11:05,522 --> 00:11:08,391
- Uncle?
- She's my brother's daughter.

94
00:11:08,465 --> 00:11:12,589
He died in Cyprus.
I've become her guardian.

95
00:11:12,658 --> 00:11:15,506
Will she be living here?

96
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:17,425
She's here for a wedding.

97
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:21,832
- Whose wedding?
- Hers... and Miles's.

98
00:11:21,905 --> 00:11:23,847
Folcanet?

99
00:11:23,922 --> 00:11:26,311
She's heir to
a great fortune, Robert.

100
00:11:26,386 --> 00:11:28,361
It becomes her dowry.

101
00:11:28,433 --> 00:11:32,328
If she marries Miles, he's offered
to show his gratitude to me.

102
00:11:32,402 --> 00:11:34,442
Money, money, money,
money, money, money.

103
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:23,693
Just who are they
practicing to kill, Rob?

104
00:12:23,761 --> 00:12:26,991
Who do they see when
they thrust the lance?

105
00:12:27,058 --> 00:12:30,222
It's me and you, Rob,
that's who. You and me.

106
00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:32,428
Well, on this occasion,
it's more me than you.

107
00:12:32,497 --> 00:12:35,563
Next time you feel righteous indignation,
you do the heroic bit.

108
00:12:35,633 --> 00:12:38,830
You'll have no trouble of Daguerre.
No trouble at all.

109
00:12:38,898 --> 00:12:41,898
Something interesting
outside?

110
00:12:43,313 --> 00:12:45,769
Go on.
Take a proper look.

111
00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:50,545
But don't let him
see you looking.

112
00:12:54,354 --> 00:12:58,151
Sir Robert Hode,
Earl of Huntingdon.

113
00:12:58,225 --> 00:12:59,786
The charges?

114
00:12:59,858 --> 00:13:04,233
Insulting a knight of the Realm
and obstructing the king's laws.

115
00:13:04,306 --> 00:13:07,786
<i>Obstructing the king's laws.</i>

116
00:13:07,858 --> 00:13:10,509
Sir Robert, please.

117
00:13:11,505 --> 00:13:14,669
Baron Daguerre...

118
00:13:14,737 --> 00:13:18,033
I ask the court's forgiveness
for any offense I have brought...

119
00:13:18,098 --> 00:13:21,873
to the throne
or to Sir Miles Folcanet...

120
00:13:21,938 --> 00:13:26,378
and I apologize
with all sincerity and humility.

121
00:13:26,450 --> 00:13:28,621
<i>Very well.</i>

122
00:13:28,689 --> 00:13:32,038
The court is a witness to your humility
and accepts your apology...

123
00:13:32,113 --> 00:13:34,447
as I'm sure
Sir Miles will.

124
00:13:34,514 --> 00:13:37,645
You may rise, Sir Robert.

125
00:13:39,378 --> 00:13:41,233
A moment, please.

126
00:13:41,298 --> 00:13:45,575
If I may remind
the first baron of the Realm...

127
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:48,105
Norman law calls
for separate justice...

128
00:13:48,178 --> 00:13:50,447
for separate issues,
Sir Roger.

129
00:13:50,513 --> 00:13:52,782
There were two offenses.

130
00:13:55,890 --> 00:13:59,370
As for Sir Robert's insulting me,
certainly I'm a forgiving man.

131
00:13:59,442 --> 00:14:02,060
I have forgiven.
But, uh...

132
00:14:02,129 --> 00:14:05,129
eager as I am to be done
with this unfortunate incident...

133
00:14:05,202 --> 00:14:07,624
I'm bound to point out
the letter of the law...

134
00:14:07,697 --> 00:14:09,552
which states
separate justice...

135
00:14:09,617 --> 00:14:11,722
<i>for separate issues.</i>

136
00:14:11,793 --> 00:14:15,568
<i>This man attempted to stop
agents of the king...</i>

137
00:14:15,633 --> 00:14:17,805
from carrying out
their sworn duty!

138
00:14:17,874 --> 00:14:21,135
<i>- That's a dreadful offense.
- Concentrate.</i>

139
00:14:21,202 --> 00:14:23,984
<i>And what punishment does the law demand?</i>

140
00:14:24,050 --> 00:14:26,057
The punishment
is a public beating.

141
00:14:26,129 --> 00:14:28,398
<i>To be flogged.</i>

142
00:14:28,465 --> 00:14:31,814
I suggest at
the castle gate at noon.

143
00:14:31,889 --> 00:14:33,799
My lord, I am not to be treated
like a common thief.

144
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:37,899
<i>You may be a Saxon earl, Hode,
but the Saxons no longer rule England.</i>

145
00:14:37,969 --> 00:14:42,061
I demand the right of trial by combat.

146
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:43,985
I challenge
Sir Miles Folcanet.

147
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:45,905
- I'll kill him.
- Silence!

148
00:14:48,434 --> 00:14:52,776
Sir Miles,
Robert Hode shall be flogged...

149
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:54,825
but one lash only.

150
00:14:54,897 --> 00:14:57,516
That's my judgment.

151
00:14:57,586 --> 00:15:00,717
You treacherous,
lying, cheating...

152
00:15:00,785 --> 00:15:02,956
- That's enough, Hode! Silence!
- That's not nearly enough!

153
00:15:03,025 --> 00:15:05,742
- This man should be hanged!
- Five lashes, and I shall have the honor.

154
00:15:05,809 --> 00:15:08,395
- What would you know about honor?
- Twenty lashes from the Sergeant-at-Arms!

155
00:15:08,465 --> 00:15:11,051
- Why not 50? A hundred?
- No, 20! You're too wild, Sir Robert.

156
00:15:11,122 --> 00:15:13,194
Wild?
Much worse than that.

157
00:15:13,265 --> 00:15:17,705
I'm a fool.
I thought you were noble.

158
00:15:17,777 --> 00:15:21,487
<i>Behold the glorious Normans.</i>

159
00:15:21,553 --> 00:15:23,495
The noble
baron of the Realm...

160
00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:26,123
whose great-grandfather
was no more than a pirate.

161
00:15:26,194 --> 00:15:30,929
<i>From cutthroat tojudge
in the blink of an eye.</i>

162
00:15:30,994 --> 00:15:33,001
<i>Once they raped
and pillaged.</i>

163
00:15:33,073 --> 00:15:35,626
Now they collect taxes.

164
00:15:36,946 --> 00:15:39,946
Norman taxes
on Saxon land.

165
00:15:40,017 --> 00:15:43,214
Norman taxes
on Saxon grain.

166
00:15:43,281 --> 00:15:46,248
Norman taxes
on Saxon liberty.

167
00:15:46,321 --> 00:15:49,191
Let us bow to
the miracle of change.

168
00:15:49,265 --> 00:15:53,738
From pirate to leech
in the blink of a bloody Norman eye!

169
00:15:54,834 --> 00:15:56,841
Release him!

170
00:16:00,082 --> 00:16:05,002
Robert Hode,
fourth earl of Huntingdon...

171
00:16:05,073 --> 00:16:09,099
with the powers of the king
which are vested in me...

172
00:16:09,169 --> 00:16:11,274
it's decreed that
you forfeit to the throne...

173
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:14,641
<i>your lands and title
and all things in your possession.</i>

174
00:16:14,705 --> 00:16:20,269
As of this day,
you are cast outside the law.

175
00:16:20,337 --> 00:16:23,654
And as an outlaw,
you're beyond the reach of its protection.

176
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:26,796
Any and all who would give you
shelter or comfort...

177
00:16:26,866 --> 00:16:30,182
will be deemed treasonous.

178
00:16:30,258 --> 00:16:34,316
Because you are
of noble birth...

179
00:16:34,385 --> 00:16:38,575
these consequences will be reviewed
by the king's justiciar.

180
00:16:38,642 --> 00:16:41,806
Until that time,
you shall be shackled...

181
00:16:41,874 --> 00:16:45,070
<i>in the keep
of the Daguerre Castle.</i>

182
00:16:46,097 --> 00:16:47,952
Have you
anything more to say?

183
00:16:49,937 --> 00:16:51,985
Very well, then.

184
00:16:58,225 --> 00:17:01,482
Hold it there!
Keep 'em back!

185
00:17:01,553 --> 00:17:03,790
Stop it. Stop!

186
00:17:05,170 --> 00:17:07,625
Tell them to move away... now.

187
00:17:07,697 --> 00:17:10,315
<i>Do as he says. Move back!</i>

188
00:17:40,305 --> 00:17:42,214
Seize them!

189
00:17:43,953 --> 00:17:45,808
<i>- Seize them!
- You should have killed him.</i>

190
00:17:45,873 --> 00:17:50,761
- You should have kept your mouth shut.
- Yesterday I was a hero.

191
00:17:50,833 --> 00:17:52,873
<i>- Make your mind up.
- Out of the way!</i>

192
00:18:19,185 --> 00:18:21,291
Keep going!

193
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:42,954
Up there!

194
00:18:43,025 --> 00:18:45,578
On the battlements!

195
00:18:45,649 --> 00:18:47,886
I want them alive!
I want them alive.

196
00:18:48,850 --> 00:18:51,151
- Don't shoot!
- Now, kick.

197
00:18:51,217 --> 00:18:54,479
Kick! Kick!

198
00:18:56,849 --> 00:18:59,337
<i>Scaffold! Scaffold!</i>

199
00:19:24,305 --> 00:19:27,273
Raise the bridge!
Raise the bridge!

200
00:19:27,345 --> 00:19:29,200
Raise it!

201
00:19:29,265 --> 00:19:33,194
<i>- They're crossing, you fools!
- Raise the bridge!</i>

202
00:19:35,217 --> 00:19:38,152
<i>Raise the bridge!</i>

203
00:19:38,225 --> 00:19:41,520
Raise the bridge!
Raise the bridge!

204
00:19:41,585 --> 00:19:44,455
Hold on!

205
00:19:47,889 --> 00:19:51,882
<i>After them!
After them!</i>

206
00:19:55,889 --> 00:19:59,818
Lower the bridge!
Lower the bridge!

207
00:19:59,889 --> 00:20:02,028
<i>Lower the bridge!</i>

208
00:20:05,137 --> 00:20:07,047
<i>Lower the bridge!</i>

209
00:20:38,545 --> 00:20:41,294
<i>Let me guess.
The horses have gone home?</i>

210
00:20:41,361 --> 00:20:44,176
Yes, the horses
have gone home.

211
00:20:44,241 --> 00:20:46,151
Congratulations.

212
00:20:47,121 --> 00:20:49,031
Thank you.

213
00:20:51,025 --> 00:20:52,934
I'm starved.

214
00:20:53,009 --> 00:20:54,918
Me too.

215
00:20:58,225 --> 00:21:02,862
It's raining.

216
00:21:02,929 --> 00:21:06,955
If only I hadn't encouraged you
to stand up for the miller.

217
00:21:07,025 --> 00:21:09,164
If only I hadn't
have listened.

218
00:21:11,889 --> 00:21:13,962
Bloody Normans.

219
00:21:19,025 --> 00:21:21,261
<i>Summer is y-comen in</i>

220
00:21:21,329 --> 00:21:23,434
<i>Loude sing, cuckoo</i>

221
00:21:23,505 --> 00:21:25,677
And the seeds
are growing warm

222
00:21:25,745 --> 00:21:28,592
Loude sing, cuckoo

223
00:21:33,905 --> 00:21:36,272
How are you
at walking backwards?

224
00:21:36,337 --> 00:21:39,436
Well, I've never had
to try yet, short ass.

225
00:21:39,505 --> 00:21:41,839
Short ass, is it?

226
00:21:41,904 --> 00:21:44,271
Careful.
He doesn't like being called names.

227
00:21:44,337 --> 00:21:46,027
And what do you do,
ferret face?

228
00:21:46,096 --> 00:21:50,472
I just follow him around and bury
all the people who've called him names.

229
00:21:50,544 --> 00:21:53,806
Ferret face seems to think
you're a bit of a hard man, short ass.

230
00:21:59,921 --> 00:22:01,743
Rob.

231
00:22:01,809 --> 00:22:05,038
- What's this?
- Show him. Give me the sword.

232
00:22:14,417 --> 00:22:17,483
Barnsdale rules.
You're in Yorkshire now.

233
00:22:28,977 --> 00:22:31,912
<i>- Come on. Come on.
- Hey!</i>

234
00:22:37,777 --> 00:22:40,592
Lying in the dark,
the queen asked the king...

235
00:22:40,657 --> 00:22:45,000
"Why, darling husband, do you
always have such a tiny, little thing?"

236
00:23:04,177 --> 00:23:05,802
Ugly, aren't you,
pig face?

237
00:23:05,873 --> 00:23:08,655
Yes!
Hard-headed too!

238
00:23:14,257 --> 00:23:17,574
- Help!
- He can't swim!

239
00:23:31,089 --> 00:23:34,864
Help! Help! Will!

240
00:23:41,873 --> 00:23:43,727
Help! Help!

241
00:23:44,817 --> 00:23:47,468
- Help!
- Rob, here!

242
00:23:47,537 --> 00:23:49,424
Rob!

243
00:23:53,233 --> 00:23:56,680
Help! Help!

244
00:24:01,585 --> 00:24:03,887
Help!

245
00:24:12,241 --> 00:24:15,623
<i>Help! Help!</i>

246
00:24:15,697 --> 00:24:18,697
Help!

247
00:24:20,593 --> 00:24:22,448
Out you come, shorty.

248
00:24:22,513 --> 00:24:25,164
In you come, lofty!

249
00:24:37,873 --> 00:24:41,222
- John Little.
- Rob...

250
00:24:41,297 --> 00:24:43,206
Robin Hood.

251
00:24:45,264 --> 00:24:47,436
This is Will.

252
00:24:47,505 --> 00:24:51,784
Will Scarlett.

253
00:24:51,857 --> 00:24:55,948
So, what makes you two take
to the byways? You're not beggars.

254
00:24:56,017 --> 00:24:58,537
Let's just say we disagreed
with our Norman masters.

255
00:24:58,608 --> 00:25:02,602
- I hope you killed a few.
- Yeah, we're outlawed, on the run.

256
00:25:02,673 --> 00:25:05,968
You hungry?
Cold, wet, nowhere to go?

257
00:25:06,032 --> 00:25:08,040
The question is,
are you trustworthy?

258
00:25:08,112 --> 00:25:10,316
There are none more trustworthy
in England, John Little.

259
00:25:10,384 --> 00:25:13,680
Yeah, well, you better be.
Anyway, I like you.

260
00:25:13,745 --> 00:25:16,047
Even him. Come on.

261
00:25:16,913 --> 00:25:19,596
Food.

262
00:25:27,152 --> 00:25:29,487
<i>You've heard of Stepthrough, right?</i>

263
00:25:29,553 --> 00:25:33,066
<i>Now, don't forget.
You're friends of mine from Pontefract...</i>

264
00:25:33,137 --> 00:25:35,144
<i>and you're thieves.</i>

265
00:25:40,017 --> 00:25:42,221
Broth smells good.

266
00:25:42,289 --> 00:25:44,809
Sam. Robin and Will.

267
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:48,295
Sam's a carpenter.
Miter tried to chisel him.

268
00:25:48,368 --> 00:25:50,124
Tried to screw
more taxes out of him.

269
00:25:50,192 --> 00:25:54,022
I wouldn't pay up. They screwed
my sawing arm right out of its socket.

270
00:25:54,097 --> 00:25:55,951
- You're welcome, whoever you are.
- Thank you.

271
00:25:56,017 --> 00:25:57,926
When it's ready, Will.

272
00:26:00,113 --> 00:26:03,790
We're forced to live
like bats in caves.

273
00:26:03,857 --> 00:26:05,766
Much!

274
00:26:09,969 --> 00:26:12,751
New friends.
This is Robin Hood...

275
00:26:12,817 --> 00:26:15,086
<i>and Will Scarlett.</i>

276
00:26:15,152 --> 00:26:17,487
If you say so.

277
00:26:17,553 --> 00:26:21,098
- Hello, Robin.
- You've got a twinkle in your eye.

278
00:26:21,168 --> 00:26:23,786
Better than the sharp end
of a dagger, my friend.

279
00:26:25,425 --> 00:26:30,640
You're most welcome, Robin.
And Will... What was it? Scarlett?

280
00:26:30,704 --> 00:26:32,198
Yes, Scarlett.

281
00:26:33,552 --> 00:26:36,040
Jack and Charlie...

282
00:26:36,112 --> 00:26:39,079
this man's Robin Hood,
so he says.

283
00:26:39,152 --> 00:26:42,316
<i>Jack and Charlie,
the Runnel boys.</i>

284
00:26:42,384 --> 00:26:44,457
<i>Bad boys.</i>

285
00:26:47,792 --> 00:26:49,647
I need some ale.

286
00:26:49,712 --> 00:26:53,061
Which one of you thieves
has stolen my ale?

287
00:26:53,137 --> 00:26:56,006
How did you come to be here, John?

288
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:59,658
I fell in love with a Norman's daughter,
and she with me.

289
00:26:59,728 --> 00:27:02,827
And we ran away together.

290
00:27:02,896 --> 00:27:04,936
He burned down my house
while my mother and my father...

291
00:27:05,009 --> 00:27:08,075
and my two brothers
slept in it.

292
00:27:08,144 --> 00:27:10,053
She was caught
and tortured...

293
00:27:11,377 --> 00:27:13,832
and I took to
the forests of England.

294
00:27:16,113 --> 00:27:19,113
Just wandering.
I've settled down now...

295
00:27:19,184 --> 00:27:21,737
here in Sherwood.

296
00:27:24,592 --> 00:27:28,040
- Breakfast?
- Not such a bad spot after all, eh?

297
00:27:31,025 --> 00:27:32,683
- Morning.
- Morning.

298
00:27:32,752 --> 00:27:36,135
Stop drooling. There's nothing for you.
Kitchen's closed.

299
00:27:36,208 --> 00:27:39,983
One meal.
That's all you get here. Rules is rules.

300
00:27:40,048 --> 00:27:42,983
That's the truth.
You boys are moving out...

301
00:27:43,057 --> 00:27:45,162
unless you can do
something we can't do.

302
00:27:45,232 --> 00:27:47,436
- What can you do?
- Do?

303
00:27:52,912 --> 00:27:55,595
I can shoot...
a bit.

304
00:27:55,664 --> 00:27:57,966
That's fine,
isn't it, Harry?

305
00:27:58,032 --> 00:28:01,032
Charlie, we'll do a wand.

306
00:28:07,536 --> 00:28:10,351
<i>- Ready!
- If you can shoot closer than Harry...</i>

307
00:28:10,416 --> 00:28:12,326
you can stay.

308
00:28:14,096 --> 00:28:15,984
That little stick?

309
00:28:16,049 --> 00:28:17,740
<i>I can hardly see it.</i>

310
00:28:17,809 --> 00:28:20,711
Just aim for
the nearest tree, handsome.

311
00:28:30,385 --> 00:28:33,199
He's right on it.

312
00:28:33,265 --> 00:28:35,174
On your way,
handsome.

313
00:28:53,425 --> 00:28:55,880
Look at this!
He split it!

314
00:29:02,768 --> 00:29:04,711
It's a miracle,
Robin.

315
00:29:04,784 --> 00:29:07,151
It's all in
the middle finger.

316
00:29:07,216 --> 00:29:09,420
In the middle finger,
Harry.

317
00:29:09,488 --> 00:29:11,398
So what's for breakfast?

318
00:29:15,024 --> 00:29:17,577
A man's
on his own here.

319
00:29:17,648 --> 00:29:20,365
We share the caves,
the water and the fire.

320
00:29:20,432 --> 00:29:22,287
And nothing else.

321
00:29:22,352 --> 00:29:24,491
We don't share loot
unless you go out together.

322
00:29:24,561 --> 00:29:26,830
Understand, handsome?

323
00:29:26,896 --> 00:29:29,798
And since you two are such expert thieves,
you can go out on your own.

324
00:29:29,872 --> 00:29:32,261
Unless you'd like
to come with me.

325
00:29:32,337 --> 00:29:34,409
- Where are you going?
- Great North Road.

326
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:37,863
- See what's moving.
- Fine. We'll come along.

327
00:29:37,936 --> 00:29:42,671
You're first-timers, so don't expect
a full share of the loot, handsome.

328
00:29:43,888 --> 00:29:46,474
I don't like that name.

329
00:29:46,544 --> 00:29:50,952
Well, uh, how about
sweetheart, then?

330
00:29:51,024 --> 00:29:53,261
You don't like the name,
I don't like you.

331
00:29:53,328 --> 00:29:55,914
<i>Shut your mouth, Harry.
Hey!</i>

332
00:29:56,945 --> 00:29:58,919
- You'll take me first!
- I want him!

333
00:29:58,992 --> 00:30:01,513
<i>- You've offended my guest.
- My honor, John.</i>

334
00:30:01,584 --> 00:30:04,552
Well, aren't I the popular one?
Right.

335
00:30:04,625 --> 00:30:06,119
<i>- Who's first?
- Me.</i>

336
00:30:06,193 --> 00:30:08,843
- I am.
- We'll have to toss a coin.

337
00:30:08,912 --> 00:30:12,109
You got a coin, Will?

338
00:30:12,176 --> 00:30:14,216
Certainly, Rob.

339
00:30:14,288 --> 00:30:16,743
Good.

340
00:30:16,816 --> 00:30:18,791
Heads, I win.
Tails, John loses.

341
00:30:18,864 --> 00:30:21,417
I'm watching you.

342
00:30:32,752 --> 00:30:35,622
Well, John,
seems like I win.

343
00:30:35,697 --> 00:30:37,551
You're learning fast.

344
00:30:37,617 --> 00:30:41,326
- Any of you interested in more money than you've ever seen?
- Aye!

345
00:30:41,392 --> 00:30:44,775
- Then we should forget the North Road and try the Hucknall Road.
- Why the Hucknall Road?

346
00:30:44,849 --> 00:30:47,631
Because tomorrow is
Sir Thomas Mansfield's hunt...

347
00:30:47,696 --> 00:30:50,282
and Miles Folcanet will
ride over there this morning...

348
00:30:50,353 --> 00:30:53,255
with a purse full
of silver.

349
00:30:53,329 --> 00:30:56,744
And how does an honest thief
come to know such things?

350
00:30:56,817 --> 00:30:59,980
Because, like many other thieves,
I was invited.

351
00:31:21,104 --> 00:31:22,959
Whoa!

352
00:31:23,024 --> 00:31:26,221
Sir Miles, what a lovely morning
for a canter in the woods.

353
00:31:26,288 --> 00:31:30,543
<i>- I didn't expect to see you here.
- No, I'm afraid you did not.</i>

354
00:31:30,608 --> 00:31:35,343
And the beauteous Marian. I certainly
am not regretting our happy meeting.

355
00:31:37,008 --> 00:31:39,877
But I'm afraid you soon will.
Get him! Move!

356
00:31:39,952 --> 00:31:41,862
Get him!

357
00:31:55,184 --> 00:31:57,485
Whoa.

358
00:31:57,553 --> 00:32:00,684
What a pity. I was just beginning
to enjoy the chase.

359
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:03,272
- It isn't over yet, Miles.
- Throw down your sword.

360
00:32:03,344 --> 00:32:06,214
This is one corner
you cannot escape from.

361
00:32:13,742 --> 00:32:17,866
I think it would save unnecessary bloodshed
if you laid down your sword.

362
00:32:17,934 --> 00:32:20,552
<i>Do it.
And get off your horses.</i>

363
00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:30,790
Strip them.

364
00:32:32,111 --> 00:32:34,532
- Come on.
- Come on!

365
00:32:37,806 --> 00:32:40,741
So, you've sunk to
your true level, Hode.

366
00:32:41,775 --> 00:32:44,044
Earl indeed.

367
00:32:44,110 --> 00:32:46,860
You are just another
thieving Saxon.

368
00:32:48,206 --> 00:32:51,272
Tell me, Miles,
how is your wound?

369
00:32:51,342 --> 00:32:53,644
Hmm. It'll heal.

370
00:32:53,710 --> 00:32:56,710
But some wounds never heal.

371
00:32:56,783 --> 00:32:59,019
Tell that to Daguerre.

372
00:32:59,086 --> 00:33:01,508
Tell my dear old friend...

373
00:33:01,583 --> 00:33:03,754
some wounds...

374
00:33:03,822 --> 00:33:05,229
never heal.

375
00:33:06,766 --> 00:33:08,043
Go.

376
00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:21,194
My future husband
is sulking.

377
00:33:21,262 --> 00:33:23,651
Oh, I don't know.
He looks quite happy to me.

378
00:33:23,726 --> 00:33:25,668
Good morning, Marian.

379
00:33:25,742 --> 00:33:29,517
- Well, I'll be off. My bow needs...
- Grummeting.

380
00:33:29,582 --> 00:33:31,818
Grummeting. Exactly.

381
00:33:33,390 --> 00:33:38,311
- Well, then, how are the wedding plans?
- In hand, thank you.

382
00:33:38,382 --> 00:33:41,382
So, what are you going
to do with me? Tie me up?

383
00:33:41,454 --> 00:33:44,072
- Could be a lashing.
- How many strokes?

384
00:33:44,142 --> 00:33:47,077
- As many as are necessary.
- And then it's finished?

385
00:33:47,151 --> 00:33:50,446
That depends.
Have you ever been lashed before?

386
00:33:50,510 --> 00:33:52,365
I've never had someone
make me beg them to stop.

387
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:54,852
Then you've never
had a proper lashing.

388
00:33:57,263 --> 00:34:01,703
You're free to go, or stay if you feel
you have something to offer.

389
00:34:01,774 --> 00:34:03,662
What could I offer
the man who has everything?

390
00:34:03,727 --> 00:34:07,142
- Don't play with me.
- You're so handsome when you're angry.

391
00:34:08,334 --> 00:34:10,701
Go and stitch
your hero's neck together.

392
00:34:40,270 --> 00:34:42,212
Give me 50 of your men...

393
00:34:42,287 --> 00:34:46,116
and I'll scour the forest
till it's clean of this vermin.

394
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:48,743
Fifty enough for one fox?

395
00:34:48,814 --> 00:34:51,497
I nearly had him today,
all on my own.

396
00:34:51,567 --> 00:34:53,421
He would've been
begging for mercy.

397
00:34:53,487 --> 00:34:56,105
- But the thugs were all around me.
- Is that how it was?

398
00:34:56,175 --> 00:34:58,695
I would have.
It was all I could do to...

399
00:34:58,766 --> 00:35:01,635
All you could do
to find your sword?

400
00:35:01,710 --> 00:35:04,460
My dearest. My hero.

401
00:35:07,214 --> 00:35:11,492
I won't send 50 men into the forest
to be ambushed and killed...

402
00:35:11,566 --> 00:35:14,054
but we will catch him.

403
00:35:14,126 --> 00:35:16,428
<i>It occurs to me
that these outlaws...</i>

404
00:35:16,494 --> 00:35:18,915
<i>are a threat to
the peace of Barnsdale...</i>

405
00:35:18,990 --> 00:35:23,463
to the forests of Doncaster,
Blyth and Sherwood.

406
00:35:25,998 --> 00:35:29,162
We have to raise
more taxes because of him.

407
00:35:29,230 --> 00:35:32,361
That will make him
really popular.

408
00:35:33,871 --> 00:35:35,813
I will post a reward
for information...

409
00:35:35,887 --> 00:35:38,472
a huge reward...
for his head on a plate.

410
00:35:38,542 --> 00:35:40,397
<i>They'll talk.</i>

411
00:35:40,462 --> 00:35:42,699
And if not...

412
00:35:42,767 --> 00:35:45,068
we'll hang a few.

413
00:35:46,734 --> 00:35:48,938
Good. Very good.

414
00:36:19,343 --> 00:36:21,993
Nothing like an abbot on his ass
to make one's day.

415
00:36:25,582 --> 00:36:28,200
<i>That's my lunch!</i>

416
00:36:28,270 --> 00:36:31,205
I'd say you've eaten all your
brothers and sisters for breakfast.

417
00:36:31,278 --> 00:36:33,350
You'll need another
hen run for lunch.

418
00:36:33,422 --> 00:36:35,910
It's how I earn a living.

419
00:36:35,982 --> 00:36:40,106
I eat chickens to produce the bones,
I make the bones into holy relics. Look.

420
00:36:40,174 --> 00:36:42,989
St. Peter's pinkie.
Only three marks.

421
00:36:43,054 --> 00:36:44,909
Our Lady's big toe.

422
00:36:44,974 --> 00:36:46,861
<i>Ten marks,
and it's yours.</i>

423
00:36:46,927 --> 00:36:50,222
And with the money, I have to buy
more chickens to make more bones.

424
00:36:50,286 --> 00:36:52,969
I hate chickens.

425
00:36:53,039 --> 00:36:55,657
Relax, holy man.
Good for the digestion.

426
00:36:55,727 --> 00:36:58,825
Put me on my feet,
and I'll beat you fair and square.

427
00:36:58,894 --> 00:37:02,375
I'll not deny a man a fight.

428
00:37:03,726 --> 00:37:08,233
Shall I bless you now,
or when you're dead?

429
00:37:10,766 --> 00:37:12,676
Go on!

430
00:37:23,758 --> 00:37:26,147
Bloody hell!

431
00:37:45,486 --> 00:37:47,309
So you be
Robin Hood, then?

432
00:37:47,374 --> 00:37:49,927
<i>- Very nicely done.
- Thank you.</i>

433
00:37:49,998 --> 00:37:54,122
<i>- And now for your cash, and make no bones about it.
- Cash?</i>

434
00:37:54,190 --> 00:37:56,579
I'm sorry to disappoint you.

435
00:37:56,655 --> 00:38:00,037
Since when do you friars
carry no money?

436
00:38:00,110 --> 00:38:03,012
<i>- You bloodsuckers are never short.
- Not me, friend.</i>

437
00:38:03,086 --> 00:38:07,210
Abbot's thrown me out
just for killing his nephew.

438
00:38:07,278 --> 00:38:09,645
That's why I'm out
selling saints' fingers.

439
00:38:09,710 --> 00:38:12,906
Anyone care for St. Vitus's ankle bone...
the one he danced on?

440
00:38:15,342 --> 00:38:17,514
But since you can
swing a sword like that...

441
00:38:17,582 --> 00:38:21,226
you can join with us.

442
00:38:21,294 --> 00:38:23,945
- And have a price on my head too?
- What's that?

443
00:38:24,014 --> 00:38:27,756
There's a reward out for Mr. Hood.
They want your head in a noose.

444
00:38:27,822 --> 00:38:30,954
Miter's testing a rope right now
on the charcoal burner's children...

445
00:38:31,022 --> 00:38:33,771
<i>to make the parents talk.</i>

446
00:38:38,670 --> 00:38:43,886
Perhaps this will loosen
some tongues.

447
00:38:44,014 --> 00:38:45,836
Thank you.

448
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:51,397
<i>I repeat, anyone
with any information...</i>

449
00:38:51,469 --> 00:38:54,469
leading to the capture
of this Robin Hood...

450
00:38:54,542 --> 00:38:57,259
<i>will receive
a handsome reward.</i>

451
00:38:57,326 --> 00:39:00,675
<i>They may also see
their children grow old.</i>

452
00:39:23,662 --> 00:39:26,825
Move it! Move it!

453
00:39:35,822 --> 00:39:38,473
Hey, you two!
Look who's here.

454
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:41,509
- Hey!
- Mama, I'm here.

455
00:39:52,878 --> 00:39:55,333
- What is it, Will?
- Daguerre's outfoxed us.

456
00:39:55,406 --> 00:39:57,261
He doesn't need
to hunt us down.

457
00:39:57,326 --> 00:40:00,260
He's turning our own people
against us with bribes and threats.

458
00:40:00,333 --> 00:40:03,148
Somebody will crack soon,
and he knows it.

459
00:40:03,213 --> 00:40:06,726
- Then we'll have to be foxier still, right?
- Right.

460
00:40:06,798 --> 00:40:08,838
Then we'll ride into Nottingham
at the end of the month.

461
00:40:08,910 --> 00:40:10,819
Nottingham?

462
00:40:12,430 --> 00:40:14,317
Hear me.

463
00:40:14,381 --> 00:40:18,276
I ride into Nottingham
next Tuesday.

464
00:40:18,350 --> 00:40:21,350
- Now, who's with me?
- Nottingham?

465
00:40:21,422 --> 00:40:23,625
<i>- You're mad!
- Fine, Harry.</i>

466
00:40:23,694 --> 00:40:25,603
You're out.
Now, who's in?

467
00:40:28,910 --> 00:40:30,765
<i>Sam.</i>

468
00:40:30,830 --> 00:40:34,179
Just the man we need.
Now, can you make boxes?

469
00:40:34,254 --> 00:40:36,675
Can I make boxes?
Is Friar Tuck hungry?

470
00:40:43,150 --> 00:40:45,004
- Ouch!
- Not too tight.

471
00:40:45,070 --> 00:40:48,899
- She's to be married, not tortured.
- What's the difference?

472
00:40:53,645 --> 00:40:57,769
Ah. The torturer himself.

473
00:40:57,837 --> 00:41:01,220
All he's missing is the little black hood
with slits for eyes.

474
00:41:01,294 --> 00:41:04,294
My dear,
you look stunning.

475
00:41:04,365 --> 00:41:07,497
<i>Everything going to be
ready for the 7th?</i>

476
00:41:07,566 --> 00:41:11,428
Out of the question.
This hideous rag fits what it touches.

477
00:41:11,502 --> 00:41:14,568
Doesn't suit me.
Color makes me look like a witch.

478
00:41:14,638 --> 00:41:18,532
It scratches.
In short, Uncle, it won't do.

479
00:41:18,605 --> 00:41:20,515
Oh.

480
00:41:21,485 --> 00:41:23,340
How difficult of it.

481
00:41:23,405 --> 00:41:27,147
- I think you look magnificent in it.
- You would.

482
00:41:27,214 --> 00:41:29,188
That proves I'm right,
Uncle.

483
00:41:29,261 --> 00:41:32,906
<i>If Dancing Bear thinks it's lovely,
it must be terrible.</i>

484
00:41:32,974 --> 00:41:35,145
He has no taste.

485
00:41:35,214 --> 00:41:37,156
But I think you would
look magnificent in anything.

486
00:41:37,230 --> 00:41:40,077
There you are.
No discrimination either.

487
00:41:40,142 --> 00:41:44,746
Magnificent in anything?
Even better in nothing at all, I suppose.

488
00:41:44,814 --> 00:41:47,814
He's a lecher.
A crude, tasteless lecher.

489
00:41:47,886 --> 00:41:50,220
Marian, you can't go on
with this.

490
00:41:50,285 --> 00:41:54,060
- Exactly.
- You know what I mean.

491
00:41:54,125 --> 00:41:56,362
Uncle, I will not wear
this dress in public.

492
00:41:56,430 --> 00:41:58,634
<i>We will have
to start all over again.</i>

493
00:41:58,702 --> 00:42:00,557
But we would have
to postpone the wedding.

494
00:42:00,622 --> 00:42:03,339
How dreadful.

495
00:42:04,781 --> 00:42:08,130
Peregrine, come again
in the morning, please.

496
00:42:08,206 --> 00:42:12,068
Please help me
talk to her later when this is all over.

497
00:42:12,142 --> 00:42:14,051
Perhaps we could talk.

498
00:42:14,126 --> 00:42:16,101
- Say what you have to say.
- Alone.

499
00:42:16,174 --> 00:42:19,621
- Here and now.
- I am not used to begging.

500
00:42:19,693 --> 00:42:21,548
- I don't have the skills.
- No.

501
00:42:21,613 --> 00:42:24,581
- You're used to getting your own way.
- But I am begging.

502
00:42:27,181 --> 00:42:29,036
It would make me
so happy.

503
00:42:29,101 --> 00:42:31,174
Yes, your happiness
comes first and last!

504
00:42:31,246 --> 00:42:34,541
And I would conquer the world
to make you happy.

505
00:42:34,605 --> 00:42:36,744
Fight the Turk...

506
00:42:36,813 --> 00:42:39,977
do battle with
a thousand infidel...

507
00:42:41,710 --> 00:42:44,393
to bring a smile
to your eyes.

508
00:42:44,461 --> 00:42:47,178
Conquer your own lechery,
Miles...

509
00:42:47,246 --> 00:42:50,409
fight your own stupid greed...

510
00:42:50,478 --> 00:42:54,340
and do battle with anybody
as far away as possible!

511
00:42:54,413 --> 00:42:56,901
I don't want you.

512
00:43:11,629 --> 00:43:14,499
Leave me alone, Uncle.

513
00:43:15,725 --> 00:43:18,278
You will marry him...

514
00:43:18,349 --> 00:43:20,651
on the 7 th.

515
00:43:22,509 --> 00:43:24,419
Nicole.

516
00:43:46,574 --> 00:43:49,803
Come on. Bring the box.
Can't be that heavy. It's not full yet.

517
00:43:49,870 --> 00:43:52,936
Right. Who's next?
We've done the butcher, the dyer...

518
00:44:10,253 --> 00:44:14,182
<i>- In here.
Let the fever leave him, lord.</i>

519
00:44:14,253 --> 00:44:17,036
<i>Slay the demons
that are in his blood.</i>

520
00:44:17,102 --> 00:44:20,266
- Where's your husband?
- Please spare him.

521
00:44:20,334 --> 00:44:23,400
- Spare me.
- He's been burning sick for three weeks.

522
00:44:23,470 --> 00:44:25,325
There are demons
in his blood.

523
00:44:25,390 --> 00:44:28,685
Let me guess.
You can't pay your taxes.

524
00:44:28,749 --> 00:44:30,604
Don't arrest us,
Sheriff.

525
00:44:30,669 --> 00:44:33,833
Take me.
Do what you will.

526
00:44:33,901 --> 00:44:35,527
Use my body if you wish.

527
00:44:35,598 --> 00:44:38,445
- Christ, not again.
- Again?

528
00:44:38,510 --> 00:44:41,095
Oh, yes. Again, please.

529
00:45:09,421 --> 00:45:11,690
John!

530
00:45:16,237 --> 00:45:18,441
- This way!
- No, this way.

531
00:45:37,517 --> 00:45:40,419
The taxes! The taxes!

532
00:45:40,493 --> 00:45:42,632
They've got the taxes!

533
00:45:42,701 --> 00:45:45,068
Get the tax... Get the box!

534
00:45:45,133 --> 00:45:47,206
<i>- The box!
- Where? Where?</i>

535
00:45:47,278 --> 00:45:50,092
<i>Stop them!</i>

536
00:45:53,581 --> 00:45:55,436
Stay where you are!

537
00:45:58,766 --> 00:46:00,293
The box!

538
00:46:05,741 --> 00:46:07,334
The box!

539
00:46:14,414 --> 00:46:16,650
Huh?

540
00:46:19,245 --> 00:46:22,409
- What are you looking at?
- Knock them off their horses!

541
00:46:50,958 --> 00:46:53,379
Sam Timmons.
No finer man for the boxes.

542
00:46:53,453 --> 00:46:55,842
- No finer man.
- Who needs two arms, eh?

543
00:46:55,918 --> 00:46:57,827
I'll beat them with one arm
tied behind me back.

544
00:47:10,477 --> 00:47:12,616
I'll never eat
chicken again.

545
00:47:12,686 --> 00:47:17,192
From now on,
it'll be peacock oozing with gravy.

546
00:47:17,261 --> 00:47:20,610
No, swan.
Swan's breast in Madeira.

547
00:47:20,685 --> 00:47:23,555
We've all died
and gone to heaven.

548
00:47:23,629 --> 00:47:25,517
Speaking from experience,
you wouldn't get in.

549
00:47:25,581 --> 00:47:28,036
<i>So, this what keeps Baron Daguerre...</i>

550
00:47:28,109 --> 00:47:31,273
<i>so kind and so cheerful?</i>

551
00:47:31,341 --> 00:47:34,276
Hundred and one.
Hundred and...

552
00:47:38,477 --> 00:47:42,503
I don't like it, Rob.
It doesn't feel right.

553
00:47:42,573 --> 00:47:45,802
Well, it isn't right.
This isn't just loot stolen from rich men.

554
00:47:45,870 --> 00:47:48,804
<i>This is taxes.
Poor men's taxes.</i>

555
00:47:48,877 --> 00:47:51,747
It's broken the backs of farmers,
torn the guts out of stonemasons...

556
00:47:51,821 --> 00:47:53,676
blinded weavers.

557
00:47:53,741 --> 00:47:55,978
<i>- It's their money.
- I didn't think of it like that.</i>

558
00:47:56,046 --> 00:47:57,901
<i>Let's keep it to ourselves for now.</i>

559
00:48:02,285 --> 00:48:05,220
<i>You are an idiot. You made him a rich man.</i>

560
00:48:05,294 --> 00:48:08,109
Who'd think they'd steal the king's taxes?
No one would ever...

561
00:48:08,174 --> 00:48:10,116
Who'd think he'd steal the king's taxes?

562
00:48:10,190 --> 00:48:13,638
Who'd think he'd feel
the king's wenches?

563
00:48:13,709 --> 00:48:16,328
Enough!

564
00:48:26,637 --> 00:48:29,026
So that's his game.

565
00:48:29,101 --> 00:48:33,258
<i>This Robin Hood couldn't
care less about the money.</i>

566
00:48:33,326 --> 00:48:36,043
It's us he's after.

567
00:48:36,110 --> 00:48:40,103
And thanks to you, Miter,
he's got us.

568
00:48:41,741 --> 00:48:45,571
Who were these taxes raised for?
Prince John.

569
00:48:45,646 --> 00:48:49,802
<i>And even now he's making
his royal progress through the land...</i>

570
00:48:49,869 --> 00:48:51,724
<i>collecting his cash.</i>

571
00:48:53,038 --> 00:48:56,169
And when Prince John's men
get here...

572
00:48:56,237 --> 00:48:58,692
what have we got
to give them?

573
00:48:58,765 --> 00:49:00,805
Nothing.

574
00:49:00,877 --> 00:49:03,081
<i>And we can't raise
another tax.</i>

575
00:49:03,149 --> 00:49:05,320
They've got nothing left.
We've bled them dry.

576
00:49:05,389 --> 00:49:07,975
So where does
the king's money come from?

577
00:49:08,046 --> 00:49:11,494
From... me!

578
00:49:14,573 --> 00:49:18,796
From my... harvests.

579
00:49:18,861 --> 00:49:21,479
My silver goblets.

580
00:49:21,549 --> 00:49:25,127
The clothes on my back!

581
00:49:25,197 --> 00:49:29,475
And who's laughing at us?
Robin Hood... outlaw.

582
00:49:39,021 --> 00:49:40,777
What are you spying on?

583
00:49:46,382 --> 00:49:48,770
<i>Here he comes.</i>

584
00:49:52,910 --> 00:49:55,048
Come on!

585
00:49:57,389 --> 00:49:59,877
- Oh, get up.
- Come on. Come on.

586
00:49:59,949 --> 00:50:02,218
Come on.

587
00:50:03,181 --> 00:50:06,530
- Move!
- Well, well, well.

588
00:50:06,606 --> 00:50:10,534
And what kind of fruit are you
to be falling from a tree?

589
00:50:10,605 --> 00:50:12,907
You look familiar.
What's your name, young man?

590
00:50:12,974 --> 00:50:15,657
Martin. Martin Pryde.

591
00:50:15,725 --> 00:50:18,693
Pryde, eh?
I like it.

592
00:50:18,765 --> 00:50:21,035
You from these parts,
Martin?

593
00:50:22,029 --> 00:50:24,746
Been in jail?

594
00:50:24,813 --> 00:50:27,977
What do you want
with a bunch of outlaws...

595
00:50:28,045 --> 00:50:30,728
thieves and murderers?

596
00:50:32,333 --> 00:50:35,180
I can ride.
I can shoot.

597
00:50:35,246 --> 00:50:39,621
Ooh. What do you say?
Shall we give him breakfast?

598
00:50:41,262 --> 00:50:45,036
To earn your breakfast,
you've got to split these.

599
00:50:49,709 --> 00:50:51,497
<i>- Mount up.
- Where are you going?</i>

600
00:50:51,566 --> 00:50:54,795
Never you mind.
Split logs, you'll eat.

601
00:51:12,301 --> 00:51:14,308
Let us pray.

602
00:51:19,054 --> 00:51:21,225
<i>Amen.</i>

603
00:51:21,293 --> 00:51:23,148
<i>Ooh!</i>

604
00:51:23,213 --> 00:51:26,595
- Ooh!
- Amen.

605
00:51:26,669 --> 00:51:29,866
I apologize if the steel is cold.
It couldn't be helped.

606
00:51:29,933 --> 00:51:34,024
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned
a whole lot and I'm doing it again.

607
00:51:34,093 --> 00:51:37,257
Today there will be
a special collection for St. Robin.

608
00:51:37,325 --> 00:51:40,292
- There's no such saint... Ooh.
- Robin, Father.

609
00:51:40,365 --> 00:51:43,464
Tell them as a symbol
of his vow of poverty...

610
00:51:43,533 --> 00:51:45,540
the church renounces
all gold and silver...

611
00:51:45,613 --> 00:51:48,395
and that includes
the emptying of pockets.

612
00:51:48,462 --> 00:51:53,579
Announce it, unless you want
to become more nun than abbot.

613
00:51:53,645 --> 00:51:55,500
Today...

614
00:51:55,565 --> 00:51:59,591
Today, in holy observance
of St. Robin...

615
00:51:59,661 --> 00:52:02,509
<i>we remove all gold
and silver from sight...</i>

616
00:52:02,573 --> 00:52:04,428
as a symbol
of his vow of poverty...

617
00:52:04,493 --> 00:52:08,519
and we ask
for a generous offering.

618
00:52:08,589 --> 00:52:11,785
You realize this is
a mortal sin, my child.

619
00:52:19,629 --> 00:52:23,306
Forgive us our trespasses, as we
forgive those who trespass against us.

620
00:52:26,669 --> 00:52:29,254
Compliments of Friar Tuck.

621
00:52:30,573 --> 00:52:32,842
St. Peter's pinkie.
Genuine relic.

622
00:52:32,909 --> 00:52:36,455
Protects you against
apoplexy, plague and, uh...

623
00:52:36,525 --> 00:52:38,980
fowl language.

624
00:52:48,557 --> 00:52:50,466
<i>All right, Will.</i>

625
00:52:55,629 --> 00:52:57,484
Mm-hmm.

626
00:52:59,340 --> 00:53:01,796
Mm-hmm.

627
00:53:09,036 --> 00:53:11,240
Let's have a look.

628
00:53:31,661 --> 00:53:35,305
Baron Daguerre,
I have to visit the castles of Pontefract...

629
00:53:35,372 --> 00:53:37,445
Ripon and York by nightfall.

630
00:53:37,517 --> 00:53:42,121
I have no time to wait
while you stutter out excuses.

631
00:53:42,188 --> 00:53:45,320
- His Majesty, Prince John...
- His Majesty?

632
00:53:45,389 --> 00:53:47,593
There is little hope
of Richard returning.

633
00:53:47,661 --> 00:53:50,727
Prince John will be
crowned king one day, soon.

634
00:53:50,797 --> 00:53:53,731
His Majesty requires you
to render his tax...

635
00:53:53,804 --> 00:53:57,153
in total, the sum
of 50,000 marks...

636
00:53:57,229 --> 00:54:00,709
to him in person
on the 12th day of December.

637
00:54:00,780 --> 00:54:03,595
Gerald.
Lord Tewkesbury.

638
00:54:03,660 --> 00:54:06,759
I can raise no more.
The people are penniless.

639
00:54:06,829 --> 00:54:08,684
They've come to hate us
for these burdens.

640
00:54:08,749 --> 00:54:13,419
Taxes are there to be hated by some,
spent by others.

641
00:54:13,485 --> 00:54:17,129
You have a great castle,
a great fortune...

642
00:54:17,196 --> 00:54:20,971
barns full of grain,
cellars full of wine...

643
00:54:21,036 --> 00:54:22,946
coffers full of silver.

644
00:54:24,301 --> 00:54:26,243
It's your choice.

645
00:54:32,045 --> 00:54:33,900
Lodwick.

646
00:54:34,988 --> 00:54:38,305
<i>I want Robin Hood
in this hall in chains.</i>

647
00:54:38,380 --> 00:54:42,472
Miter! Double the reward
for information.

648
00:54:42,541 --> 00:54:44,712
No, triple it!
Make it irresistible!

649
00:54:46,252 --> 00:54:48,674
Lodwick.

650
00:54:48,749 --> 00:54:53,026
I want all your men
out every day.

651
00:54:53,101 --> 00:54:56,101
Scour the North Road,
the Hucknall Road.

652
00:54:56,173 --> 00:54:59,020
Take dogs... mastiffs...

653
00:54:59,084 --> 00:55:01,702
bloodhounds, deerhounds.

654
00:55:01,772 --> 00:55:03,627
Track them down.

655
00:55:03,692 --> 00:55:08,002
Find their hideout.
Burn them in their beds.

656
00:55:08,076 --> 00:55:12,167
But bring this Robin Hood
in front of my fury.

657
00:55:14,540 --> 00:55:16,450
Go.

658
00:55:26,253 --> 00:55:29,100
As for Marian...

659
00:55:29,164 --> 00:55:31,074
is she with him?

660
00:55:32,236 --> 00:55:34,440
Surely not.

661
00:55:36,557 --> 00:55:38,728
I cannot believe...

662
00:55:41,613 --> 00:55:43,784
I'll kill him.

663
00:55:45,613 --> 00:55:48,875
Give me 50 men.
I beg you!

664
00:55:48,941 --> 00:55:50,850
No, Miles!

665
00:55:52,556 --> 00:55:54,629
I favor a more
subtle approach.

666
00:55:54,701 --> 00:55:56,610
Subtle?

667
00:55:58,477 --> 00:56:00,964
Baron, sometimes
you are so wet...

668
00:56:01,036 --> 00:56:02,978
one could shoot
snipe off you.

669
00:56:14,797 --> 00:56:16,706
Nicole...

670
00:56:17,741 --> 00:56:19,912
my only comfort.

671
00:56:22,572 --> 00:56:26,631
Nicole... my inspiration.

672
00:56:27,885 --> 00:56:32,140
Hode is ours.
You and I can catch him.

673
00:56:32,204 --> 00:56:34,343
Will you help me?

674
00:56:35,309 --> 00:56:37,163
Of course.

675
00:56:52,972 --> 00:56:55,077
Ready!

676
00:57:13,292 --> 00:57:16,358
- Going somewhere, Rob?
- An assignation.

677
00:57:16,428 --> 00:57:18,316
You can't go alone.
The patrols are everywhere.

678
00:57:18,380 --> 00:57:20,420
An assignation?
Might be a trap.

679
00:57:20,493 --> 00:57:22,533
One I would gladly
ride into.

680
00:57:22,605 --> 00:57:25,223
- We're coming with you.
- You can't go alone.

681
00:57:26,701 --> 00:57:29,668
<i>Then I'll take Martin as my page.</i>

682
00:57:29,741 --> 00:57:31,715
<i>Come on. Jump up.</i>

683
00:57:34,220 --> 00:57:37,636
If we're not back by midnight,
we'll be in a Nottingham jail.

684
00:57:50,284 --> 00:57:54,059
Who was Robin Hood
before he was Robin Hood?

685
00:57:54,124 --> 00:57:56,491
- Nobody, really.
- Must have been someone.

686
00:57:56,556 --> 00:57:58,695
Everybody's someone.

687
00:58:05,420 --> 00:58:08,355
Where is this?
Who are you meeting?

688
00:58:08,428 --> 00:58:11,462
Not so many questions.
Wait.

689
00:58:33,357 --> 00:58:36,390
Why is it
a secret assignation?

690
00:58:36,460 --> 00:58:39,275
- Hmm?
- Is it a woman?

691
00:58:39,340 --> 00:58:41,195
Your mistress?

692
00:58:41,260 --> 00:58:44,195
Well, since
you're so curious...

693
00:58:44,269 --> 00:58:46,123
I'll tell you a story.

694
00:58:46,189 --> 00:58:48,610
Once upon a time,
there was a good-for-nothing...

695
00:58:48,684 --> 00:58:52,230
drunken, young ne'er-do-well,
a bit like me.

696
00:58:52,301 --> 00:58:56,130
This lout was befriended
by a great lord in a mighty castle.

697
00:58:56,204 --> 00:59:00,579
And in that castle he saw the most
beautiful woman in the whole of England.

698
00:59:00,652 --> 00:59:03,402
- Really? In the whole of England?
- Mm-hmm.

699
00:59:03,469 --> 00:59:07,363
And France and Spain
and the whole world.

700
00:59:07,436 --> 00:59:09,575
And he fell
in love with her.

701
00:59:09,644 --> 00:59:12,099
<i>For she was not
only beautiful...</i>

702
00:59:12,172 --> 00:59:16,395
she was proud and fiery,
as prickly as a thorn...

703
00:59:16,460 --> 00:59:18,948
yet soft
as thistledown.

704
00:59:21,548 --> 00:59:26,851
<i>- Am I boring you?
- No! No, no. Tell me more.</i>

705
00:59:26,924 --> 00:59:30,339
Well, the tragedy was she was promised
to another mighty lord...

706
00:59:30,412 --> 00:59:32,834
<i>a cruel, brutal,
ignorant man...</i>

707
00:59:32,908 --> 00:59:35,461
who couldn't
make her happy.

708
00:59:35,532 --> 00:59:37,736
<i>- Could he?
- Never.</i>

709
00:59:37,804 --> 00:59:40,193
Never, ever.
So what happened?

710
00:59:40,268 --> 00:59:42,821
<i>Well, the young man,
he was proud also.</i>

711
00:59:42,892 --> 00:59:44,867
He could not
control his temper.

712
00:59:44,940 --> 00:59:47,842
He cursed his friend,
the mighty lord.

713
00:59:47,916 --> 00:59:50,699
And he was outlawed
and went off into the greenwood.

714
00:59:50,765 --> 00:59:53,732
And the maiden did nothing,
I suppose.

715
00:59:53,804 --> 00:59:56,259
<i>She was doomed to
marry the cruel lord.</i>

716
00:59:56,332 --> 00:59:59,463
But one day, the young man
received a message from her.

717
00:59:59,532 --> 01:00:02,827
<i>- Did he?
- To ride out alone and meet her.</i>

718
01:00:02,893 --> 01:00:07,911
- What are you saying?
- So he did. And here we are.

719
01:00:10,604 --> 01:00:12,523
Robin!

720
01:00:15,339 --> 01:00:17,063
Robin!

721
01:00:17,131 --> 01:00:19,749
- Marian!
- No, it's a trap! Your story is beautiful.

722
01:00:19,819 --> 01:00:22,121
What are you
talking about? Marian!

723
01:00:22,187 --> 01:00:24,608
- What are you...
- Don't argue! Run for your life!

724
01:00:26,955 --> 01:00:29,573
Back to the river.
We'll have to swim for it.

725
01:00:29,643 --> 01:00:32,327
- Who are you?
- What a time to ask philosophical questions.

726
01:00:32,395 --> 01:00:34,304
Now go!

727
01:00:42,186 --> 01:00:44,772
The river!

728
01:00:48,875 --> 01:00:50,784
Oh!

729
01:00:53,899 --> 01:00:56,583
Come on!

730
01:00:56,651 --> 01:00:58,756
<i>Come on!</i>

731
01:01:05,643 --> 01:01:07,268
The river!

732
01:01:15,403 --> 01:01:18,370
After them! Can none of you swim?

733
01:01:25,323 --> 01:01:29,578
Get the horses. We'll cut them off
on the other side. Move!

734
01:01:36,203 --> 01:01:38,755
Now do you believe me?

735
01:01:41,067 --> 01:01:45,573
- Now, Martin, I want you to talk to me.
- What do you want me to say?

736
01:01:45,643 --> 01:01:48,611
I want you to tell me who you are
and why your hair is dyed black.

737
01:01:48,682 --> 01:01:51,650
I'm just a lusty young youth
with a swagger and an eye for the girls.

738
01:01:51,723 --> 01:01:54,625
- Don't play with me.
- You're so handsome when you're angry.

739
01:01:56,523 --> 01:01:58,759
Do you like me
like this?

740
01:02:00,779 --> 01:02:02,634
Marian!

741
01:02:08,779 --> 01:02:10,689
<i>Halt!</i>

742
01:02:18,379 --> 01:02:20,518
Into the cart.

743
01:02:30,027 --> 01:02:32,034
<i>Whoa!</i>

744
01:02:32,107 --> 01:02:34,660
Hey, you. Did you see
two men cross this road?

745
01:02:34,731 --> 01:02:38,113
- I got eyes, haven't I, soldier?
- Don't give me that, taffy.

746
01:02:38,187 --> 01:02:40,326
<i>- Did you see anyone?
- Taffy, is it?</i>

747
01:02:40,395 --> 01:02:43,144
Well, I did.
Yes, I did see someone.

748
01:02:43,211 --> 01:02:45,480
I saw the king of England
riding by.

749
01:02:45,547 --> 01:02:48,329
One more smart remark,
and I'll...

750
01:02:49,707 --> 01:02:53,798
<i>- No one crossed over, right?
- Dead right, Captain.</i>

751
01:02:53,867 --> 01:02:56,322
<i>- Spot on.
- Back into the woods.</i>

752
01:02:56,395 --> 01:02:58,369
Spread out.
They can't be far away.

753
01:02:58,443 --> 01:03:01,826
<i>Get up there! Come on!
Hyah! Come on!</i>

754
01:03:05,195 --> 01:03:07,715
You can come out now.
Show yourselves.

755
01:03:10,699 --> 01:03:13,033
- Have they gone?
- Yeah.

756
01:03:13,099 --> 01:03:15,336
Cozy in there, isn't it?

757
01:03:15,403 --> 01:03:18,021
I'm Emlyn,
bow-maker extraordinary.

758
01:03:18,091 --> 01:03:21,026
And I don't like folks
as calls me taffy.

759
01:03:21,098 --> 01:03:24,001
Well, Emlyn, you've
saved our lives.

760
01:03:24,074 --> 01:03:26,376
This is Martin, my young squire.
And I'm...

761
01:03:26,443 --> 01:03:29,378
Don't tell me. Let me guess.

762
01:03:30,890 --> 01:03:33,378
They're making songs about you
and your merry men...

763
01:03:33,451 --> 01:03:35,458
<i>and the tricks
you get up to.</i>

764
01:03:35,531 --> 01:03:38,597
<i>Keeps us all going, Mr. Hood.</i>

765
01:03:38,667 --> 01:03:41,089
It's an honor to have you
onboard my humble cart.

766
01:03:41,163 --> 01:03:45,254
The honor is ours.
What are these things we've been lying on?

767
01:03:45,323 --> 01:03:48,040
Oh. These are
the makings of 100 bows...

768
01:03:48,107 --> 01:03:49,962
for Baron Daguerre to try out.

769
01:03:50,027 --> 01:03:52,067
Not ordinary bows, mind,
but longbows. See?

770
01:03:52,139 --> 01:03:54,048
They are enormous.

771
01:03:54,123 --> 01:03:57,254
Yeah, six-foot long,
and hits a mark at 200 foot.

772
01:03:57,322 --> 01:03:59,494
And shoots round corners?

773
01:04:01,707 --> 01:04:04,096
I've never met an Englishman
who could resist a bad joke.

774
01:04:04,171 --> 01:04:07,783
No, listen.
Pierces armor at 50 paces.

775
01:04:07,851 --> 01:04:10,917
Norman soldiers?
No bother at all. Wham!

776
01:04:10,987 --> 01:04:13,354
Like a pigeon on a spit.

777
01:04:13,419 --> 01:04:15,394
They're meant
to skewer you, Mr. Hood.

778
01:04:15,466 --> 01:04:18,019
How much is Daguerre
paying you for these?

779
01:04:19,115 --> 01:04:21,700
Fifty marks, if I'm lucky.

780
01:04:21,770 --> 01:04:24,552
Half the time,
these barons don't pay at all.

781
01:04:24,619 --> 01:04:27,685
I'll give you 100 and all the food
you can eat for as long as you stay.

782
01:04:30,763 --> 01:04:34,025
Oh, tiddly idle, idle dum
Tiddly idle, idle dum

783
01:04:34,091 --> 01:04:37,386
Tiddly-aye, tiddly-aye
Tiddly, tiddly oh

784
01:04:42,827 --> 01:04:46,372
Back before nightfall. Were you going
to report me missing to Baron Daguerre?

785
01:04:46,442 --> 01:04:49,574
Stop taking stupid risks, Rob.
They want you.

786
01:04:49,643 --> 01:04:52,577
Meet Emlyn.
He has the most extraordinary weapon.

787
01:04:52,650 --> 01:04:54,952
- Now, now.
- A bow, six-foot tall.

788
01:04:55,018 --> 01:04:58,367
- Can shoot through armor at 50 paces.
- Can it shoot round corners?

789
01:04:58,443 --> 01:05:01,061
No, but it fries eggs.
Saxon wit.

790
01:05:01,130 --> 01:05:02,985
Tomorrow I'll give you
a go at it.

791
01:05:03,050 --> 01:05:07,044
Martin, take Emlyn for something to eat
and water his horse.

792
01:05:07,115 --> 01:05:09,668
Anything you say,
Robin. Come on.

793
01:05:09,739 --> 01:05:12,040
They've tripled
the reward for you, Rob.

794
01:05:12,106 --> 01:05:14,757
There's talk of bounty hunters
moving into Nottingham.

795
01:05:14,826 --> 01:05:17,793
- Aye.
- 300 marks, Rob.

796
01:05:17,866 --> 01:05:20,550
That's more than
a poor man's wildest dreams.

797
01:05:20,619 --> 01:05:23,488
Some of them are desperate.
They're starvin'.

798
01:05:23,563 --> 01:05:26,662
Who's to blame 'em for selling out
a bunch of cutthroats?

799
01:05:26,731 --> 01:05:28,586
Who indeed?

800
01:05:28,651 --> 01:05:31,749
There is one way, Rob...
to win them onto our side.

801
01:05:34,251 --> 01:05:36,193
What have you decided?

802
01:05:42,187 --> 01:05:44,837
All right.
Gather around, everyone.

803
01:05:47,659 --> 01:05:51,434
Now, the price on Robin's head
is 300 marks, and on us, even 100.

804
01:05:51,499 --> 01:05:54,281
- I'd sell you for 50.
- You'd sell your mother for a cooked bat.

805
01:05:54,346 --> 01:05:57,161
<i>Some of us have come to a decision.</i>

806
01:05:57,226 --> 01:06:01,318
The taxes we took
in Nottingham are Saxon taxes.

807
01:06:01,387 --> 01:06:05,697
I say we should raise our own taxes...
a tax on every abbot, knight, rich merchant...

808
01:06:05,770 --> 01:06:10,113
landowner and baron in Barnsdale and
Nottingham, and give that to the poor people.

809
01:06:10,187 --> 01:06:13,034
- What do you say?
- Give it away?

810
01:06:13,098 --> 01:06:14,953
All of it?
You must be crazy!

811
01:06:15,018 --> 01:06:18,630
No, he's not crazy, Harry.
The money belongs to them, not to us.

812
01:06:18,698 --> 01:06:21,349
If we don't, we could lose everything.
Someone's bound to talk.

813
01:06:21,418 --> 01:06:24,713
<i>- Why not?
- Now, don't get this wrong. We still keep some of it.</i>

814
01:06:24,779 --> 01:06:28,390
A collectors' fee, you could call it.
Let's say, huh, half?

815
01:06:28,458 --> 01:06:31,807
So you're all in it?
Well, I say you're all crazy.

816
01:06:31,882 --> 01:06:35,111
Why don't we give them the lot
and our food as well?

817
01:06:35,178 --> 01:06:37,666
Anyone want to join Harry?

818
01:06:37,738 --> 01:06:41,033
You can ride with him
and keep every penny. Speak now.

819
01:06:47,019 --> 01:06:49,986
You're all crazy.

820
01:06:52,427 --> 01:06:57,096
All right.
All right, I'll do it. Here's to it.

821
01:06:58,218 --> 01:07:00,291
Good. Fill these purses.

822
01:07:00,363 --> 01:07:02,468
Will, you and the Runnels
take Wentbridge and Snaith.

823
01:07:02,539 --> 01:07:05,157
Much, Little,
go south to Nottingham.

824
01:07:05,226 --> 01:07:06,982
<i>Marian.</i>

825
01:07:08,682 --> 01:07:10,886
You and I'll go west.

826
01:07:10,954 --> 01:07:13,857
<i>A thousand marks for every village.
And make sure they know who it's from.</i>

827
01:07:13,930 --> 01:07:16,035
From Robin Hood, is it?

828
01:07:20,971 --> 01:07:25,193
<i>They killed Tanzie! Tanzie's dead!</i>

829
01:07:25,259 --> 01:07:27,692
<i>They killed him!</i>

830
01:07:50,987 --> 01:07:52,841
What happened?

831
01:07:55,595 --> 01:07:58,694
I don't know
who you are, young lad...

832
01:07:58,764 --> 01:08:01,960
and where you've been
not to see who's been at work here.

833
01:08:02,027 --> 01:08:05,802
<i>This is the hand of the
Norman soldier here, my lad.</i>

834
01:08:05,867 --> 01:08:07,972
What did he do wrong?

835
01:08:09,227 --> 01:08:11,267
They said he knew
this Robin Hood.

836
01:08:11,339 --> 01:08:13,249
He didn't.

837
01:08:13,323 --> 01:08:16,040
But if he did,
he wouldn't have told them anything.

838
01:08:22,955 --> 01:08:25,989
So they killed him.

839
01:08:26,059 --> 01:08:28,230
My husband.

840
01:08:30,923 --> 01:08:34,535
And then they took
every piece of food, every animal...

841
01:08:34,603 --> 01:08:38,051
every valuable thing
in this house...

842
01:08:38,124 --> 01:08:41,058
even my granddaughter...
12 years old.

843
01:08:41,131 --> 01:08:45,735
- What would you do to men like that?
- I'd kill them.

844
01:09:01,643 --> 01:09:04,490
Here.

845
01:09:04,555 --> 01:09:09,289
It won't bring him back to life,
but it might help you buy some food.

846
01:09:09,355 --> 01:09:12,900
It's yours,
taken back from them...

847
01:09:12,971 --> 01:09:15,175
by Robin Hood.

848
01:09:19,755 --> 01:09:21,665
Why?

849
01:09:21,739 --> 01:09:24,040
Because they occupy our land.
'Cause we're Saxons.

850
01:09:24,107 --> 01:09:26,725
- I had no idea.
- By the same logic, I should kill you.

851
01:09:26,795 --> 01:09:29,795
- Did you give them the money?
- Yes. Too late.

852
01:09:29,867 --> 01:09:33,663
I don't know what to say,
but I feel guilty.

853
01:09:33,739 --> 01:09:37,122
<i>- What good will that do?
- Clear the way!</i>

854
01:09:37,195 --> 01:09:39,049
Hyah! Hyah!

855
01:09:41,931 --> 01:09:44,615
We should be one, undivided,
equal and free.

856
01:09:44,683 --> 01:09:46,690
Shh.

857
01:09:46,763 --> 01:09:50,921
Yes.

858
01:10:52,747 --> 01:10:54,787
He's come for the money.

859
01:11:07,851 --> 01:11:12,357
Ha! Just to show you
what fools you English are.

860
01:11:12,427 --> 01:11:14,599
Right through it, Emlyn?

861
01:11:28,171 --> 01:11:32,132
<i>Holy Mary in heaven!
It really does it.</i>

862
01:11:32,203 --> 01:11:34,341
Like I said, you're English.

863
01:11:34,411 --> 01:11:37,859
- Do you know what I could do
with a hundred of these?

864
01:11:37,931 --> 01:11:39,786
Welsh wizard.

865
01:11:44,043 --> 01:11:47,655
Do you think I'm a foolish king
or a weakling?

866
01:11:49,195 --> 01:11:52,294
You think I can allow
one baron to lose my tax...

867
01:11:52,363 --> 01:11:54,250
while all the others pay...

868
01:11:54,315 --> 01:11:57,992
or should they pay more
to make up the loss?

869
01:11:58,058 --> 01:12:00,993
- No, sire.
- Majesty!

870
01:12:03,659 --> 01:12:06,725
No, Your Majesty.

871
01:12:06,795 --> 01:12:09,959
<i>- You're not foolish or weak.
- Baron Daguerre...</i>

872
01:12:10,027 --> 01:12:12,711
it is you who are
foolish and weak.

873
01:12:14,091 --> 01:12:17,222
It's no good pining
for my brother Richard.

874
01:12:17,291 --> 01:12:19,298
He won't be back.

875
01:12:20,555 --> 01:12:24,002
And it's no good trying
to be nice to your peasants.

876
01:12:24,075 --> 01:12:26,279
They'll just rob you.

877
01:12:27,627 --> 01:12:29,798
Yes, Your Majesty.

878
01:12:29,867 --> 01:12:32,038
It was not the king
who let outlaws rob churches...

879
01:12:32,107 --> 01:12:34,857
cut throats and steal purses
on the Great North Road.

880
01:12:34,923 --> 01:12:38,436
It was not the king who allowed
outlaws to steal his taxes.

881
01:12:38,507 --> 01:12:40,776
<i>No, it is not.</i>

882
01:12:40,843 --> 01:12:42,883
Nor do I permit
this Robin Hood...

883
01:12:42,955 --> 01:12:45,857
to ride free
over my domains...

884
01:12:45,931 --> 01:12:47,938
turning into
the people's champion...

885
01:12:48,011 --> 01:12:51,175
and threatening to topple
the whole feudal order...

886
01:12:51,243 --> 01:12:53,250
without which England
would revert...

887
01:12:53,323 --> 01:12:55,712
to the anarchy
of former days.

888
01:13:00,458 --> 01:13:03,655
The people are singing
ballads about him.

889
01:13:05,835 --> 01:13:08,617
They see
a new Saxon leader...

890
01:13:08,683 --> 01:13:11,585
emerging to threaten
my throne.

891
01:13:11,659 --> 01:13:14,212
He merely wants
Norman and Saxon...

892
01:13:14,283 --> 01:13:17,185
to have respect for each other
and live in peace.

893
01:13:17,259 --> 01:13:20,325
<i>Mm-hmm. So...</i>

894
01:13:22,667 --> 01:13:25,220
you and he...

895
01:13:25,291 --> 01:13:28,935
basically... agree.

896
01:13:32,107 --> 01:13:34,179
He was your friend?

897
01:13:34,251 --> 01:13:37,251
No, Your Majesty.

898
01:13:37,323 --> 01:13:39,811
Where is your niece?

899
01:13:41,386 --> 01:13:43,939
I wish I knew,
Your Majesty.

900
01:13:45,963 --> 01:13:49,575
They say... with him.

901
01:13:52,202 --> 01:13:54,591
I don't know, Your Majesty.

902
01:13:56,971 --> 01:13:59,654
We're going to help you,
Baron Daguerre.

903
01:13:59,723 --> 01:14:02,440
Forty of my finest soldiers
will stay with you.

904
01:14:02,506 --> 01:14:06,663
I shall put them under the command
of Sir Miles Folcanet.

905
01:14:06,731 --> 01:14:08,586
Your Majesty.

906
01:14:10,090 --> 01:14:11,945
At last.

907
01:14:15,563 --> 01:14:17,417
At last.

908
01:14:18,635 --> 01:14:20,838
You may count on me.

909
01:14:20,906 --> 01:14:23,295
You will turn over
every blade of grass...

910
01:14:23,371 --> 01:14:25,826
in Barnsdale, Sherwood
and Nottingham...

911
01:14:25,898 --> 01:14:29,444
until this man and his cutthroats
are brought to the gallows...

912
01:14:29,515 --> 01:14:33,060
and disemboweled
while they still breathe.

913
01:14:33,130 --> 01:14:36,742
I will not have
my throne threatened...

914
01:14:36,811 --> 01:14:41,089
I will not have Saxon
mock Norman...

915
01:14:41,162 --> 01:14:43,977
and I will have my money!

916
01:15:07,019 --> 01:15:08,874
Don't worry.

917
01:15:08,939 --> 01:15:11,306
We will find him for you.

918
01:15:18,091 --> 01:15:20,164
<i>Martin?</i>

919
01:15:20,236 --> 01:15:22,090
Martin!

920
01:15:24,107 --> 01:15:25,962
Martin?

921
01:15:27,083 --> 01:15:28,938
Martin.

922
01:15:33,740 --> 01:15:36,806
No, can't find him
anywhere.

923
01:15:36,876 --> 01:15:38,731
Harry's up to no good.

924
01:15:38,796 --> 01:15:41,479
Saddle up a dozen horses.
Search the woods.

925
01:15:51,147 --> 01:15:54,595
<i>You, there! Open up!</i>

926
01:15:54,667 --> 01:15:57,155
No peddlers today.

927
01:15:57,228 --> 01:16:00,162
- Off you go.
- I'm no peddler.

928
01:16:00,235 --> 01:16:04,032
Tell Sir Roger I brought
a wedding present for Sir Miles.

929
01:16:04,108 --> 01:16:06,857
Tell him
I brought the bride.

930
01:16:12,652 --> 01:16:14,692
- Let him through!
- Raise the portcullis!

931
01:16:31,436 --> 01:16:33,672
You have changed,
Marian.

932
01:16:33,739 --> 01:16:36,074
Are you all right?

933
01:16:36,140 --> 01:16:38,114
I've never been better.

934
01:16:38,187 --> 01:16:40,773
Look at you. Look what
she's done to herself.

935
01:16:40,844 --> 01:16:43,080
It's nothing to what
I'm going to do to you.

936
01:16:43,147 --> 01:16:46,530
- The hair is not a great improvement.
- It'll scrub out.

937
01:16:46,604 --> 01:16:51,557
- Clean her up!
- You can scrub me, you can dip me in perfume.

938
01:16:51,627 --> 01:16:53,537
<i>It's too late, Miles.</i>

939
01:16:53,612 --> 01:16:56,514
What you want has been
given to another man...

940
01:16:56,587 --> 01:16:58,497
with the greatest
of pleasure!

941
01:17:07,691 --> 01:17:09,546
Go!

942
01:17:16,587 --> 01:17:18,529
Sir, if I've, uh...

943
01:17:18,603 --> 01:17:20,578
If I've been
of some service...

944
01:17:20,652 --> 01:17:23,913
perhaps there's some small token...
uh, reward...

945
01:17:23,980 --> 01:17:26,019
You found her where?

946
01:17:26,091 --> 01:17:29,387
In Sherwood Forest, sir.
I recognized her straight off.

947
01:17:29,452 --> 01:17:31,426
So then you're not
one of Hode's men?

948
01:17:31,499 --> 01:17:35,012
Oh, no, sir. Not me, sir.
No, he's not a man to be trusted, sir...

949
01:17:35,083 --> 01:17:37,025
<i>from what I hear.</i>

950
01:17:37,099 --> 01:17:40,580
You are a liar!
Take him down.

951
01:17:40,651 --> 01:17:44,099
Find out everything he knows...
the hideout, weapons, numbers.

952
01:17:44,171 --> 01:17:46,059
Make him sing
any way you please!

953
01:17:46,124 --> 01:17:49,190
No, sir, please! I only
did it for the reward!

954
01:17:49,259 --> 01:17:51,561
<i>I'll tell you everything
about Robin Hood, sir!</i>

955
01:17:51,628 --> 01:17:54,497
<i>Everything, sir! Please, no!</i>

956
01:18:06,923 --> 01:18:09,193
You're sure it was her?

957
01:18:09,260 --> 01:18:11,878
- And they marry tomorrow?
- That's the word.

958
01:18:11,947 --> 01:18:13,889
- I've got to get into the castle.
- It can't be done.

959
01:18:13,964 --> 01:18:17,346
The royal guard are everywhere.
They're dangerous men.

960
01:18:17,419 --> 01:18:21,380
- But forgive me, I must go back.
- Thank you.

961
01:18:21,451 --> 01:18:23,753
You're a good friend.

962
01:18:27,211 --> 01:18:29,382
This wedding
cannot take place.

963
01:18:29,451 --> 01:18:32,550
There are ways into that castle.
Emlyn could drive his cart in.

964
01:18:34,027 --> 01:18:36,842
Robin, you cannot put us all
in danger to stop a wedding.

965
01:18:36,907 --> 01:18:38,762
It may be All Fools'
Day tomorrow...

966
01:18:38,827 --> 01:18:41,282
but there's no need
for us to carry on as if we're...

967
01:18:41,355 --> 01:18:44,006
- Much, you're a genius.
- Huh?

968
01:18:44,076 --> 01:18:46,923
They expect us to wait here
for them like frightened rabbits.

969
01:18:46,987 --> 01:18:49,638
Harry's probably told them
exactly what they need to know.

970
01:18:49,707 --> 01:18:51,562
But let us not do
what they expect.

971
01:18:51,627 --> 01:18:54,344
Let us take the battle to them
right into their mighty fortress.

972
01:18:54,411 --> 01:18:57,859
- Good, but how?
- As Much says, tomorrow is All Fools' Day...

973
01:18:57,931 --> 01:19:02,208
when the fools' parade cannot be refused
admission, even to the greatest castle.

974
01:19:02,283 --> 01:19:04,258
So we'll have a parade.

975
01:19:04,332 --> 01:19:08,194
Friar Tuck will be the lord of misrule
riding on Emlyn's cart.

976
01:19:08,267 --> 01:19:12,042
Everybody will join in...
mummers, giants, jesters...

977
01:19:12,107 --> 01:19:14,017
a whole procession
of fools.

978
01:19:17,611 --> 01:19:19,913
Sir Miles, my lady
is not decent.

979
01:19:27,372 --> 01:19:29,859
No, Nicole.

980
01:19:29,931 --> 01:19:32,168
Your lady
is not decent.

981
01:19:33,419 --> 01:19:35,874
But I'll have her
all the same.

982
01:19:35,947 --> 01:19:39,296
Does she understand?
She will be wed tomorrow.

983
01:19:39,371 --> 01:19:42,218
She will stand beside me,
and when the question comes...

984
01:19:42,284 --> 01:19:44,739
she will answer, "I will. ' '

985
01:19:44,812 --> 01:19:47,332
You are a foolish,
brutal man, Miles.

986
01:19:47,403 --> 01:19:50,021
Your desire disgusts me!

987
01:19:50,091 --> 01:19:52,033
I will not marry you...

988
01:19:52,107 --> 01:19:54,212
tomorrow or any day.

989
01:19:54,283 --> 01:19:58,538
I have willingly given myself
to another man.

990
01:19:58,604 --> 01:20:01,865
You will marry me tomorrow!

991
01:20:04,203 --> 01:20:07,171
And your other man
will surely die.

992
01:20:09,899 --> 01:20:11,754
She is your charge.

993
01:20:11,819 --> 01:20:15,136
Make sure she's there
in the morning...

994
01:20:15,211 --> 01:20:17,480
properly dressed...

995
01:20:17,548 --> 01:20:19,653
and willing!

996
01:20:50,251 --> 01:20:53,666
Nicole, you're a woman
of great appetite.

997
01:20:54,827 --> 01:20:56,737
Most women are...

998
01:20:57,899 --> 01:21:00,201
creatures of appetite.

999
01:21:02,955 --> 01:21:05,672
What men don't seem
to understand.

1000
01:21:09,611 --> 01:21:11,945
Does it offend you?

1001
01:21:12,971 --> 01:21:14,859
No...

1002
01:21:14,923 --> 01:21:17,257
but we must move.

1003
01:21:17,324 --> 01:21:20,007
The great wedding day.

1004
01:21:20,075 --> 01:21:22,922
<i>I go to bed
a richer man if...</i>

1005
01:21:22,987 --> 01:21:25,059
She'll be there.

1006
01:21:26,411 --> 01:21:28,932
My brother raised
a proud girl.

1007
01:21:29,931 --> 01:21:32,036
No wonder Robert loves her.

1008
01:21:36,651 --> 01:21:38,626
That's why he'll be here.

1009
01:21:39,756 --> 01:21:42,144
<i>He is here already.</i>

1010
01:21:42,219 --> 01:21:45,154
<i>He can't stay away.</i>

1011
01:22:23,979 --> 01:22:27,050
<i>Fix that ruby. You're all fingers and thumbs.</i>

1012
01:22:27,177 --> 01:22:30,144
Come on, girl.
Put it in the center.

1013
01:22:30,217 --> 01:22:32,901
<i>Don'tjust stand there gawping.</i>

1014
01:22:32,969 --> 01:22:35,587
Everybody stand back,
out of the way.

1015
01:22:48,617 --> 01:22:52,546
You're the most beautiful bride
England's ever seen.

1016
01:23:03,145 --> 01:23:07,717
I am the most pitiful bride
England's ever seen.

1017
01:23:13,865 --> 01:23:15,807
I...

1018
01:23:40,297 --> 01:23:43,014
<i>Make way for the ship of fools!</i>

1019
01:23:43,081 --> 01:23:46,180
<i>I am the captain,
the lord of misrule.</i>

1020
01:23:46,249 --> 01:23:48,737
Now winter is cracking
the doors of spring.

1021
01:23:48,809 --> 01:23:52,387
<i>Here come we
to rejoice and sing...</i>

1022
01:23:52,457 --> 01:23:55,140
<i>to play the fool,
to laugh and quarrel...</i>

1023
01:23:55,209 --> 01:23:59,268
and turn the whole world
upside down.

1024
01:24:01,801 --> 01:24:04,103
<i>So loose the animals
into your bed.</i>

1025
01:24:04,169 --> 01:24:06,536
Dance and tumble,
pipe and play.

1026
01:24:06,601 --> 01:24:08,608
<i>- The sun has driven...
- Stop!</i>

1027
01:24:08,681 --> 01:24:12,293
Jack Frost... away.

1028
01:24:18,281 --> 01:24:22,372
<i>You rabble don't
get in here today. Off you go!</i>

1029
01:24:22,441 --> 01:24:26,019
On All Fools' Day,
neither rich man, nor poor...

1030
01:24:26,089 --> 01:24:28,261
<i>on the guises
may close his door...</i>

1031
01:24:28,329 --> 01:24:31,144
<i>or laughter and joy
will be his nevermore.</i>

1032
01:24:31,209 --> 01:24:36,097
<i>So open up in the name of folly!
Bring us some wine and fill our belly.</i>

1033
01:24:36,169 --> 01:24:38,591
We'll have some fun
with jests and song.

1034
01:24:38,665 --> 01:24:41,633
We'll make you laugh
and we'll right all wrong.

1035
01:24:45,737 --> 01:24:47,876
Let them in.

1036
01:24:47,945 --> 01:24:49,887
Take it up!

1037
01:25:17,353 --> 01:25:21,379
We come here today in the sight
of Almighty God...

1038
01:25:21,449 --> 01:25:25,159
to join these two together
in holy matrimony.

1039
01:26:18,601 --> 01:26:22,376
Down with the demon king!
Liberate the devils!

1040
01:26:27,401 --> 01:26:29,638
Here,
take these quickly!

1041
01:26:29,705 --> 01:26:32,455
- Come on!
- Hand 'em out!

1042
01:26:35,465 --> 01:26:37,320
<i>Come on. Fight!</i>

1043
01:26:37,385 --> 01:26:41,476
Come on. Fight!
Come on!

1044
01:26:41,545 --> 01:26:43,269
Come on!

1045
01:26:43,337 --> 01:26:47,134
Marian, daughter of
Sir Reginald Daguerre of Westlake...

1046
01:26:47,209 --> 01:26:49,828
<i>do you swear
before Almighty God...</i>

1047
01:26:49,897 --> 01:26:54,272
to take this man,
Miles Folcanet, knight of Derby...

1048
01:26:54,345 --> 01:26:56,483
as your lawful
wedded husband...

1049
01:26:56,553 --> 01:27:00,295
to have and to hold,
to cleave to in the flesh...

1050
01:27:00,361 --> 01:27:03,143
<i>to love, honor and obey...</i>

1051
01:27:03,209 --> 01:27:06,624
for richer, for poorer,
in sickness and in health?

1052
01:27:09,001 --> 01:27:10,910
You say, "I do. ' '

1053
01:27:12,585 --> 01:27:14,657
<i>Marian?</i>

1054
01:27:18,825 --> 01:27:20,680
I will not marry him...

1055
01:27:22,697 --> 01:27:24,835
Not before God
or anyone else.

1056
01:27:28,777 --> 01:27:30,981
Draw!

1057
01:27:32,297 --> 01:27:33,857
Shoot!

1058
01:27:39,369 --> 01:27:41,343
Draw!

1059
01:27:43,017 --> 01:27:44,708
Shoot!

1060
01:27:56,201 --> 01:27:59,397
I'll take her. Whether she says yes or no,
it doesn't matter.

1061
01:27:59,464 --> 01:28:01,920
In the sight of God,
all things are made plain, my son.

1062
01:28:01,992 --> 01:28:03,967
And it seems quite plain
she doesn't want you.

1063
01:28:04,041 --> 01:28:08,034
<i>Abbot, your opinion
was not asked for...</i>

1064
01:28:08,104 --> 01:28:10,788
nor for that matter
was your version of God's opinion.

1065
01:28:12,009 --> 01:28:14,278
Pronounce us
man and wife now...

1066
01:28:14,345 --> 01:28:17,028
or you'll be
consulting God direct!

1067
01:28:28,393 --> 01:28:30,814
Take the castle!

1068
01:28:37,353 --> 01:28:39,077
Come on!

1069
01:29:35,209 --> 01:29:37,959
Good morning, Baron.

1070
01:29:39,529 --> 01:29:41,536
Good morning, Sir Miles.

1071
01:29:59,305 --> 01:30:01,574
Hold tight, Marian.

1072
01:30:04,424 --> 01:30:07,397
- Hode.
- Folcanet.

1073
01:30:08,904 --> 01:30:13,028
This time you have bitten off
more than you can chew!

1074
01:30:14,697 --> 01:30:16,933
Lecherous...

1075
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:18,975
treacherous...

1076
01:30:19,049 --> 01:30:20,609
evil...

1077
01:30:20,680 --> 01:30:22,785
Saxon...

1078
01:30:22,856 --> 01:30:25,223
lout!

1079
01:30:42,664 --> 01:30:45,730
- Please, I'm dying. A priest.
- I am a priest!

1080
01:30:45,800 --> 01:30:48,615
I must confess my sins
before I meet my maker!

1081
01:30:48,680 --> 01:30:52,477
- You haven't got time.
- Please, give me a blessing!

1082
01:30:52,552 --> 01:30:54,407
My son...

1083
01:30:54,472 --> 01:30:57,767
Your sins are forgiven.

1084
01:31:01,481 --> 01:31:05,343
You have played your last trick.

1085
01:31:17,801 --> 01:31:20,004
Come on! This way!

1086
01:31:30,728 --> 01:31:32,638
Daguerre!

1087
01:31:46,024 --> 01:31:48,839
<i>You have blood on your hands, Baron...
the blood of my people!</i>

1088
01:31:48,904 --> 01:31:50,792
And for what reason?
To keep us down...

1089
01:31:50,856 --> 01:31:53,027
and to keep your incompetent kings
upon a dung heap.

1090
01:31:53,096 --> 01:31:56,412
Ha! Incompetent for a Saxon!

1091
01:31:56,488 --> 01:32:00,383
You lost, remember? You know why?
Because you're too incompetent to win.

1092
01:32:00,456 --> 01:32:01,885
Lie!

1093
01:32:06,600 --> 01:32:11,107
We will make England the greatest nation
in the world in spite of the English!

1094
01:32:11,176 --> 01:32:14,656
A nation of serfs
led by thieves...

1095
01:32:14,728 --> 01:32:16,735
plunderers and autocrats.

1096
01:32:16,808 --> 01:32:19,591
Is that really what
you want, Baron?

1097
01:32:23,464 --> 01:32:25,352
We could conquer Europe.

1098
01:32:25,416 --> 01:32:29,093
More serfs,
more autocrats.

1099
01:32:32,680 --> 01:32:35,168
Give me back my country.

1100
01:32:35,240 --> 01:32:37,379
It is my country too.

1101
01:32:37,448 --> 01:32:40,448
Then drop your sword.

1102
01:33:26,408 --> 01:33:28,677
And out goes your candle!

1103
01:33:30,568 --> 01:33:32,772
Marian!

1104
01:33:32,840 --> 01:33:35,458
Robin!

1105
01:33:44,968 --> 01:33:48,099
I'll cut you in two
like the viper you are.

1106
01:33:48,168 --> 01:33:50,340
Beware my
flickering tongue, Miles.

1107
01:33:50,408 --> 01:33:53,572
You're dead, snake.

1108
01:34:33,608 --> 01:34:35,463
Welcome to hell.

1109
01:34:44,616 --> 01:34:49,350
My friends, I,
baron and feudal lord of this shire...

1110
01:34:49,416 --> 01:34:52,066
do here, in your sight,
pay homage to those...

1111
01:34:52,136 --> 01:34:54,853
<i>whose claim to this land
is older and more sacred than mine...</i>

1112
01:34:54,921 --> 01:34:57,790
to sir Robert Hode
and to all of you.

1113
01:35:02,088 --> 01:35:04,871
Stand up, Roger.

1114
01:35:10,056 --> 01:35:12,739
<i>- We all live on this island.
- We do.</i>

1115
01:35:12,809 --> 01:35:15,427
And to point the way
to the future...

1116
01:35:15,496 --> 01:35:19,718
let us have a wedding between Saxon
and Norman, between Robert and Marian!

1117
01:35:21,544 --> 01:35:25,025
Provided, of course,
she agrees.

1118
01:35:25,096 --> 01:35:29,667
I will not marry to symbolize a peace
or to ratify a treaty.

1119
01:35:30,856 --> 01:35:34,784
But this man
I will take...

1120
01:35:34,856 --> 01:35:38,118
because he makes
the May tree blossom...

1121
01:35:38,184 --> 01:35:41,282
and the bees buzz
in my breast.

1122
01:35:41,352 --> 01:35:43,491
I will take this man...

1123
01:35:43,560 --> 01:35:46,876
because he brings springtime
to my heart.

1124
01:36:03,432 --> 01:36:05,888
<i>By the toe
of Saint George and the tail of a trout...</i>

1125
01:36:05,960 --> 01:36:08,416
<i>let the cockerels crow
and the bells ring out.</i>

1126
01:36:08,488 --> 01:36:11,107
<i>Let the green shoots thrust
through the snow and ice...</i>

1127
01:36:11,176 --> 01:36:13,761
let little girls giggle
and taste of spice.

1128
01:36:13,832 --> 01:36:17,345
For a wedding, a union,
a coupling we crave...

1129
01:36:17,416 --> 01:36:20,645
and a jigging it
up and down we shall have.

1
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:51,553
It's the sense of touch.

2
00:02:53,097 --> 00:02:54,189
What?

3
00:02:56,534 --> 00:03:00,402
Any real city, you walk,
you know?

4
00:03:00,505 --> 00:03:04,339
You brush past people.
People bump into you.

5
00:03:04,442 --> 00:03:07,434
In L.A., nobody touches you.

6
00:03:10,181 --> 00:03:13,446
We're always behind
this metal and glass.

7
00:03:14,919 --> 00:03:17,820
I think we miss
that touch so much

8
00:03:17,922 --> 00:03:21,881
that we crash into each other
just so we can feel something.

9
00:03:23,895 --> 00:03:26,090
You guys okay?

10
00:03:26,197 --> 00:03:29,223
I think he hit his head.

11
00:03:29,333 --> 00:03:31,164
You don't think that's true?

12
00:03:31,269 --> 00:03:33,169
Stay in your car.

13
00:03:33,271 --> 00:03:36,069
Graham, I think
we got rear-ended.

14
00:03:36,174 --> 00:03:38,233
I think we spun around twice.

15
00:03:38,342 --> 00:03:43,302
And somewhere in there, one of us lost
our frame of reference.

16
00:03:43,414 --> 00:03:45,814
And I'm gonna
go look for it.

17
00:03:47,852 --> 00:03:50,650
- Calm down, ma'am.
- I am calm!

18
00:03:50,755 --> 00:03:52,689
I need to see your registration
and insurance.

19
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:54,781
Why? It's not my fault! It's her fault!

20
00:03:54,892 --> 00:03:56,587
- She do this!
- My fault?

21
00:03:56,694 --> 00:03:58,753
Ma'am, you really need
to wait in your vehicle.

22
00:03:58,863 --> 00:04:00,763
- My fault?
- Stop in middle of street!

23
00:04:00,865 --> 00:04:02,526
Mexicans no know how to drive.

24
00:04:02,633 --> 00:04:07,332
- She "blake" too fast.
- I "blake" too fast? I "blake" too fast.

25
00:04:07,438 --> 00:04:11,135
- I'm sorry you no see my "blake" lights.
- Ma'am.

26
00:04:11,242 --> 00:04:14,040
See, I stop when I see a long line of cars
stopped in front of me.

27
00:04:14,145 --> 00:04:16,978
Maybe you see over
steering wheel, you "blake" too!

28
00:04:17,081 --> 00:04:20,608
- Ma'am!
- I call immigration. Look what you do my car.

29
00:04:20,718 --> 00:04:22,413
Officer, can you please
write in your report

30
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,488
how shocked I am to be hit
by an Asian driver!

31
00:04:24,589 --> 00:04:27,786
- Ma'am!
- Ma'am, no. See, Detective...

32
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:35,997
All right. You've got
to calm down.

33
00:04:43,641 --> 00:04:47,737
- Hey, Detective! Nice entrance.
- Fuck you.

34
00:04:50,848 --> 00:04:55,148
- Hey, you okay?
- I'm freezin'

35
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:58,017
Shit. I heard
it might snow.

36
00:04:58,122 --> 00:05:00,488
- Get outta here.
- That's what I heard.

37
00:05:00,591 --> 00:05:03,355
- You got a smoke?
- Nah. I quit.

38
00:05:03,461 --> 00:05:06,089
Yeah, me too.

39
00:05:06,197 --> 00:05:08,688
- What do you got?
- Dead kid.

40
00:05:18,176 --> 00:05:19,973
Hey, Bob.

41
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:05,184
You get one free box of ammunition.
What kind do you want?

42
00:06:18,502 --> 00:06:20,970
Yo, Osama! Plan a jihad
on your own time.

43
00:06:21,072 --> 00:06:23,666
What do you want?

44
00:06:26,844 --> 00:06:29,608
- Are you making insult at me?
- Am I making insult "at" you?

45
00:06:29,714 --> 00:06:33,013
- Is that the closest you can come to English?
- Yes, I speak English! I am American citizen.

46
00:06:33,117 --> 00:06:35,551
- Oh, God, here we go.
- I have right like you.

47
00:06:35,653 --> 00:06:37,518
- I have right to buy gun.
- Not in my store, you don't!

48
00:06:37,755 --> 00:06:39,848
- Andy, get him outta here now!
- Go wait in the car.

49
00:06:39,957 --> 00:06:40,924
Now. Get out!

50
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:45,661
- You're an ignorant man!
- I'm ignorant? You're liberating my country

51
00:06:45,763 --> 00:06:48,823
and I'm flying 747 s into your mud huts
and incinerating your friends?

52
00:06:48,933 --> 00:06:51,925
- Get the fuck out!
- No, you get the fuck out!

53
00:06:52,036 --> 00:06:53,697
No, don't touch me!
He cheat me!

54
00:06:53,804 --> 00:06:55,704
- Andy, now!
- Let's go.

55
00:06:55,806 --> 00:06:57,296
Okay.

56
00:07:00,945 --> 00:07:03,846
You can give me the gun
or give me back the money.

57
00:07:03,948 --> 00:07:06,246
And I am really hoping
for the money.

58
00:07:11,722 --> 00:07:14,316
- What kind of ammunition do you want?
- Whatever fits.

59
00:07:14,425 --> 00:07:16,393
We got a lot of kinds.

60
00:07:16,494 --> 00:07:18,860
We got long colts,
short colts, bull heads,

61
00:07:18,963 --> 00:07:21,523
flat nose, hollowpoints,
wide cutters,

62
00:07:21,632 --> 00:07:25,068
and a dozen more that'll fit
any size hole.

63
00:07:25,169 --> 00:07:28,935
Just depends upon how
much bang you can handle.

64
00:07:30,875 --> 00:07:33,139
I'll take the ones
in the red box.

65
00:07:36,314 --> 00:07:38,976
- You know what those are?
- Can I have them?

66
00:07:48,292 --> 00:07:52,786
Did you see any white people waitin' an hour
and 32 minutes for a plate of spaghetti?

67
00:07:52,897 --> 00:07:54,831
And how many cups of coffee
did we get?

68
00:07:54,932 --> 00:07:57,799
You don't drink coffee!
And I didn't want any.

69
00:07:57,902 --> 00:08:01,668
Man, that woman poured cup after cup
to every single white person around us.

70
00:08:01,772 --> 00:08:04,832
But did she even ask you
if you wanted any?

71
00:08:04,942 --> 00:08:06,910
We didn't get any coffee that you didn't want
and I didn't order,

72
00:08:07,011 --> 00:08:09,241
and that's evidence
of racial discrimination?

73
00:08:09,347 --> 00:08:11,338
Did you notice
that our waitress was black?

74
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:13,917
And black women don't think
in stereotypes?

75
00:08:14,018 --> 00:08:15,986
You tell me. When was
the last time you met one

76
00:08:16,087 --> 00:08:18,453
who didn't think she knew
everything about your lazy ass

77
00:08:18,556 --> 00:08:20,786
before you even opened
your mouth, huh?

78
00:08:20,891 --> 00:08:23,223
That waitress sized us up
in two seconds.

79
00:08:23,327 --> 00:08:27,024
We're black, and black people don't tip.
She wasn't gonna waste her time.

80
00:08:27,131 --> 00:08:30,123
Somebody like that? Nothing you can do
to change their mind.

81
00:08:30,234 --> 00:08:32,668
How much did you leave?

82
00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:34,738
You expect me to pay
for that kind of service?

83
00:08:34,839 --> 00:08:39,242
What? What the fuck
is you laughin' at, man?

84
00:08:39,343 --> 00:08:42,312
I'm seriously starting to think that
you're jealous of Karen.

85
00:08:42,413 --> 00:08:46,611
Hardly. I'd just like to see you get through
a meal without calling her or anyone else.

86
00:08:46,717 --> 00:08:51,245
Okay, no more phone calls. As a matter of fact,
you can hold the battery.

87
00:08:51,355 --> 00:08:53,186
Okay?

88
00:08:54,658 --> 00:08:56,990
Ten bucks says
she calls you in the car.

89
00:08:57,094 --> 00:08:59,790
Wait, wait, wait.
See what that woman just did?

90
00:08:59,897 --> 00:09:01,956
- You see that?
- She's cold.

91
00:09:02,066 --> 00:09:05,365
She got colder
as soon as she saw us.

92
00:09:05,469 --> 00:09:08,597
- Ah, come on, don't start.
- Man, look around you, man.

93
00:09:08,706 --> 00:09:12,164
You couldn't find a whiter, safer or better-lit
part of this city right now.

94
00:09:12,276 --> 00:09:14,176
But yet this white woman
sees two black guys

95
00:09:14,278 --> 00:09:16,974
who look like UCLA students
strolling down the sidewalk,

96
00:09:17,081 --> 00:09:19,515
and her reaction
is blind fear?

97
00:09:19,617 --> 00:09:22,108
Look at us, dog. Are we dressed
like gangbangers?

98
00:09:22,219 --> 00:09:25,552
Huh? No.
Do we look threatening? No.

99
00:09:25,656 --> 00:09:29,558
Fact. If anybody should be
scared around here, it's us!

100
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:33,619
We're the only two black faces surrounded
by a sea of over-caffeinated white people

101
00:09:33,731 --> 00:09:36,427
patrolled by
the trigger-happy L.A.P.D.

102
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:40,095
So you tell me.
Why aren't we scared?

103
00:09:40,204 --> 00:09:42,399
'Cause we got guns?

104
00:09:42,506 --> 00:09:44,303
You could be right.

105
00:09:47,378 --> 00:09:49,608
- Get the fuck outta the car!
- Gimme the keys!

106
00:09:49,713 --> 00:09:52,443
- Hurry up! Get down!
- Okay, okay, okay, okay.

107
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:56,782
- No, no! Please!
- Don't look at me! Turn around!

108
00:09:56,887 --> 00:10:00,414
- Come on! Go!
- We're fine! Just keep moving!

109
00:10:05,596 --> 00:10:10,056
No, no, no! Take that voodoo-assed thing
off of there right now.

110
00:10:10,167 --> 00:10:12,465
I know you just didn't call
Saint Christopher voodoo.

111
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:14,435
Man's the patron saint
of travelers, dog.

112
00:10:14,538 --> 00:10:17,405
You had a conversation
with God, huh? What did God say?

113
00:10:17,508 --> 00:10:21,638
"Go forth, my son, and leave big slobbery
suction rings on every dashboard you find"?

114
00:10:21,745 --> 00:10:23,212
Why the hell do you do that?

115
00:10:23,314 --> 00:10:26,181
Look at the way your crazy ass drive,
then ask me again.

116
00:10:33,924 --> 00:10:36,449
Chevy pickup and Mercedes
driving north on Balboa.

117
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:39,256
Pickup cuts in front. Driver of the Mercedes
gets pissed, pulls a gun.

118
00:10:39,363 --> 00:10:42,059
Doesn't realize the guy in the pickup is a cop
coming off shift.

119
00:10:42,166 --> 00:10:44,100
This Barry Gibb dude is a cop?

120
00:10:44,201 --> 00:10:46,567
Yeah. Name's Conklin.
He's a narc out of Wilshire.

121
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:49,332
I got the Mercedes.

122
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:53,069
Mercedes takes a shot at him.
Detective Conklin returns fire. One shot.

123
00:10:53,177 --> 00:10:56,738
Mercedes rolls to a stop.
Driver opens the door, falls out dead.

124
00:10:56,847 --> 00:10:59,645
He looks very relaxed
for just having shot somebody.

125
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:01,615
He says he kept tryin'
to drive away.

126
00:11:01,719 --> 00:11:03,846
The Mercedes kept pulling up next to him,
screaming, waving a gun.

127
00:11:03,954 --> 00:11:06,479
Shot back in self-defense.

128
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:10,788
- Anybody actually see who shot first?
- They just heard two bangs.

129
00:11:10,895 --> 00:11:12,726
Find me a witness.

130
00:11:26,911 --> 00:11:29,675
That is a nice gun.

131
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:34,342
The car's registered
to a Cindy Bradley.

132
00:11:34,451 --> 00:11:36,316
And that's not Cindy.

133
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:39,218
That is a William Lewis.

134
00:11:39,323 --> 00:11:42,292
Found under the front seat.
Hollywood Division.

135
00:11:46,764 --> 00:11:50,700
Looks like Detective Conklin
shot himself the wrong nigger.

136
00:12:02,313 --> 00:12:05,441
- How much longer are you gonna be?
- This is the last one.

137
00:12:05,549 --> 00:12:07,449
Thank you.

138
00:12:16,193 --> 00:12:18,559
You don't think reporters
listen to police calls?

139
00:12:18,662 --> 00:12:20,459
I need to talk to you
for a second.

140
00:12:22,333 --> 00:12:24,824
You just give me a minute,
all right?

141
00:12:24,935 --> 00:12:28,462
- Find Flanagan, will you? Now.
- Yes, sir.

142
00:12:29,506 --> 00:12:30,473
Yes, honey?

143
00:12:30,574 --> 00:12:32,542
I want the locks changed
again in the morning.

144
00:12:32,643 --> 00:12:33,610
You want...

145
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:36,373
Why don't you just go lie down?
Have you checked on James?

146
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,745
Of course. I've checked on him every five
minutes since we've been home.

147
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:43,752
Do not patronize me. I want the locks
changed again in the morning.

148
00:12:44,455 --> 00:12:47,151
It's okay. Just go to bed.

149
00:12:47,257 --> 00:12:50,749
You know, didn't I just ask you
not to treat me like a child?

150
00:12:50,861 --> 00:12:53,091
I'm sorry, Miss Jean.

151
00:12:53,197 --> 00:12:54,630
Is okay I go home now?

152
00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:57,530
It's fine. Thank you
very much for staying.

153
00:12:57,635 --> 00:12:59,694
- You're welcome, no problem. Good night.
- Good night.

154
00:12:59,803 --> 00:13:01,270
We'll see you tomorrow.

155
00:13:01,372 --> 00:13:05,502
I would like the locks
changed again in the morning.

156
00:13:05,609 --> 00:13:07,907
And you might mention
that we'd appreciate it

157
00:13:08,012 --> 00:13:10,207
if next time they didn't send
a gang member.

158
00:13:10,314 --> 00:13:12,612
- A gang member? You mean that kid in there?
- Yes, yes.

159
00:13:12,716 --> 00:13:16,413
Yes. The guy with the shaved head,
the pants around his ass, the prison tattoo.

160
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:18,954
- Those are not prison tattoos.
- Oh, really? And he's not gonna sell our key

161
00:13:19,056 --> 00:13:21,650
to one of his gangbanger friends
the moment he is out our door?

162
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:22,657
We've had a tough night.

163
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:26,423
- It'd be best if you went...
- And wait for them to break in?

164
00:13:26,530 --> 00:13:29,988
I just had a gun
pointed in my face.

165
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,226
You lower your voice!

166
00:13:31,335 --> 00:13:34,065
And it was my fault
because I knew it was gonna happen.

167
00:13:34,171 --> 00:13:36,696
But if a white person sees two black men
walking towards her,

168
00:13:36,807 --> 00:13:40,334
and she turns and walks in the other direction,
she's a racist, right?

169
00:13:40,444 --> 00:13:43,038
Well, I got scared
and I didn't say anything.

170
00:13:43,147 --> 00:13:45,411
And ten seconds later
I had a gun in my face!

171
00:13:45,516 --> 00:13:49,714
I am telling you. Your amigo in there is gonna
sell our key to one of his homies.

172
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:54,314
And this time it'd be really fucking great
if you acted like you actually gave a shit!

173
00:14:21,785 --> 00:14:24,481
All right, what have we got?
Talk to me, Karen.

174
00:14:24,588 --> 00:14:26,556
Flanagan doesn't think
anybody has the story yet.

175
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:29,023
I'm the goddamn District Attorney
of Los Angeles.

176
00:14:29,126 --> 00:14:32,323
If my car gets jacked,
it's gonna make news.

177
00:14:32,429 --> 00:14:34,226
Fuck!

178
00:14:35,432 --> 00:14:37,696
Why did these guys
have to be black?

179
00:14:37,801 --> 00:14:41,237
I mean, why?
No matter how we spin this,

180
00:14:41,338 --> 00:14:44,398
I'm either gonna lose the black vote
or I'm gonna lose the law-and-order vote.

181
00:14:44,508 --> 00:14:49,673
You're worrying too much. You have
a lot of support in the black community.

182
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:52,340
All right. If we can't duck this thing,
we're gonna have to neutralize it.

183
00:14:52,449 --> 00:14:57,011
What we need is a picture of me
pinning a medal on a black man.

184
00:14:57,121 --> 00:14:59,089
Bruce?

185
00:15:00,257 --> 00:15:01,918
The firefighter.

186
00:15:02,025 --> 00:15:04,960
The one who saved the camp or something.
Northridge. What's his name?

187
00:15:05,062 --> 00:15:07,087
He's Iraqi.

188
00:15:07,197 --> 00:15:10,360
He's Iraqi?
Well, he looks black.

189
00:15:10,467 --> 00:15:14,267
He's dark-skinned, sir, but he's Iraqi.
His name's Saddam Khahum.

190
00:15:14,371 --> 00:15:17,363
Saddam?
His-His name's Saddam?

191
00:15:17,474 --> 00:15:21,604
That's real good, Bruce. I'm gonna pin a medal
on an Iraqi named Saddam.

192
00:15:21,712 --> 00:15:23,873
Give yourself a raise!

193
00:15:26,884 --> 00:15:30,376
It's been good
doing business with you.

194
00:15:30,487 --> 00:15:33,854
- How soon can I have them?
- I'm picking them up right now.

195
00:15:33,957 --> 00:15:37,586
Look, you're not listening to me.
This is an emergency.

196
00:15:37,694 --> 00:15:40,561
I keep telling you he's in pain.
He can't sleep.

197
00:15:40,664 --> 00:15:44,566
Mr. Ryan, your father has been to the clinic
three times in the last month.

198
00:15:44,668 --> 00:15:49,970
He is being treated for a urinary tract infection.
That is by no means an emergency.

199
00:15:50,073 --> 00:15:53,440
If you have any more questions
about your HMO plan,

200
00:15:53,544 --> 00:15:57,878
make an appointment to come in between
10:00 and 4:00, Monday through Friday.

201
00:15:57,981 --> 00:16:00,040
What does my father do
about sleeping tonight?

202
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:02,015
I don't know.
I'm not a doctor.

203
00:16:02,119 --> 00:16:05,020
- I wanna talk to your supervisor.
- I am my supervisor!

204
00:16:05,122 --> 00:16:06,919
- What is your name?
- Shaniqua Johnson.

205
00:16:07,024 --> 00:16:09,720
Shaniqua.
Big fucking surprise that is.

206
00:16:26,009 --> 00:16:28,375
Bronson Avenue, Westwood.

207
00:16:28,478 --> 00:16:31,174
Vehicle is described as a black,
late-model Lincoln Navigator.

208
00:16:31,281 --> 00:16:35,809
4PCI315
California plates,
4 Peter Charles Ida 315.

209
00:16:35,919 --> 00:16:39,355
Suspects are two black males,
approximately 20 years of age.

210
00:16:47,865 --> 00:16:51,926
That's not it. That's not the vehicle, John.
The plates don't match.

211
00:16:52,035 --> 00:16:56,768
The driver's gotta be 40. Nobody jacks a car
and takes it to Studio City.

212
00:17:00,911 --> 00:17:03,277
They were doin' something!

213
00:17:47,491 --> 00:17:48,890
Enthusiastic.

214
00:17:50,093 --> 00:17:52,254
Keep your hands
where I can see 'em, please.

215
00:17:52,362 --> 00:17:56,594
I'm gonna need to see your driver's license
and registration.

216
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,861
No problem.

217
00:17:58,969 --> 00:18:02,871
I'm gonna have to reach inside the glove
compartment to get the registration.

218
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:06,840
- Is that okay?
- Nice and slow, please.

219
00:18:10,981 --> 00:18:13,211
How are you tonight, Officer?

220
00:18:13,317 --> 00:18:15,182
Excellent.

221
00:18:17,054 --> 00:18:19,454
Here you go.

222
00:18:22,025 --> 00:18:24,084
Stay inside the vehicle, please.

223
00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:36,268
Let's do it again right now.

224
00:18:36,373 --> 00:18:38,398
Step outta the car, please, sir.

225
00:18:38,508 --> 00:18:42,205
Wait a minute, Officer.
I haven't been drinking or anything.

226
00:18:42,312 --> 00:18:44,542
Then we shouldn't have
a problem.

227
00:18:44,648 --> 00:18:47,310
He doesn't drink.
He's a Buddhist, for Christ's sake.

228
00:18:47,417 --> 00:18:49,248
No, it's okay.

229
00:18:49,353 --> 00:18:51,878
It's fine.

230
00:18:54,291 --> 00:18:57,658
Step onto the sidewalk, sir.

231
00:18:59,496 --> 00:19:01,760
That's good. Right there.

232
00:19:03,567 --> 00:19:05,831
Look at me.

233
00:19:05,936 --> 00:19:07,870
I want you to stand
on your right foot.

234
00:19:07,971 --> 00:19:12,135
Touch your nose with the index finger
of your left hand.

235
00:19:16,513 --> 00:19:19,107
I told you he doesn't drink.

236
00:19:19,216 --> 00:19:21,878
Ma'am, I'm only gonna tell you
one time to stay in the vehicle.

237
00:19:21,985 --> 00:19:24,545
- Ma'am?
- Honey, honey, I'm okay. I got this.

238
00:19:24,654 --> 00:19:26,918
Don't you "ma'am" me. Who the hell
do you think you're talking to?

239
00:19:27,024 --> 00:19:31,324
Look, Officer, my wife
has had a couple of drinks...

240
00:19:31,428 --> 00:19:34,397
Both of you, turn around. Put your hands on
top of your head and interlock your fingers.

241
00:19:34,498 --> 00:19:36,295
Wait. We're only a block
away from our house.

242
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,732
Hands on your head.
Interlock your fingers.

243
00:19:38,835 --> 00:19:41,963
- Hands on your head. Interlock your fingers.
- I'm a television director.

244
00:19:42,072 --> 00:19:44,836
Me and my wife were just coming home
from an awards show.

245
00:19:44,941 --> 00:19:47,205
Take your hands off him.
He's done nothing wrong.

246
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:49,471
Put your hands on top
of your head, ma'am.

247
00:19:49,579 --> 00:19:51,069
- Do what he says.
- Fuck you!

248
00:19:51,181 --> 00:19:55,049
- Put your hands...
- And you keep your filthy hands off me!

249
00:19:55,152 --> 00:19:56,813
You motherfucking pig!

250
00:19:56,920 --> 00:20:00,412
- Just stop talking!
- That's quite a mouth you have.

251
00:20:00,524 --> 00:20:02,287
Of course you know that.

252
00:20:02,392 --> 00:20:06,158
Fuck you! That's what
this is all about, isn't it?

253
00:20:06,263 --> 00:20:09,061
You thought you saw a white woman blowin' a
black man. That drove your cracker ass crazy.

254
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:10,895
Will you just shut
your fucking mouth!

255
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:14,061
I'd listen to your husband, ma'am.

256
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:16,469
Put your legs open.

257
00:20:18,241 --> 00:20:22,507
Do you have any guns or knives
or anything I might get stuck with?

258
00:20:22,612 --> 00:20:24,944
I'm wearing a cocktail dress.
What do you think?

259
00:20:25,048 --> 00:20:27,539
You'd be surprised
some of the places I've found weapons.

260
00:20:27,651 --> 00:20:28,618
He's clean.

261
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:33,487
What do you think we should do about this,
Mr. Thayer?

262
00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:38,152
My partner and I just witnessed your wife
performing fellatio on you

263
00:20:38,261 --> 00:20:40,422
while you were operating
a motor vehicle.

264
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:44,626
That's reckless endangerment,
which incidentally is a felony.

265
00:20:46,636 --> 00:20:51,232
We could charge your wife with lewd conduct
and performing a sexual act in public.

266
00:20:53,543 --> 00:20:56,273
You say you're a block
from home.

267
00:20:56,379 --> 00:20:58,677
We could use our discretion

268
00:20:58,782 --> 00:21:01,842
and let you go with a warning,

269
00:21:01,952 --> 00:21:05,388
or we could cuff you and put you
in the back of the car.

270
00:21:07,057 --> 00:21:09,958
What do you think
we should do, sir?

271
00:21:17,434 --> 00:21:20,665
Look, we're sorry, and

272
00:21:20,770 --> 00:21:26,299
we would appreciate if you would
just let us go with a warning, please.

273
00:21:30,914 --> 00:21:33,644
The man's apologizing, Tommy.

274
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:36,810
I think we can let him go. Don't you?

275
00:21:39,523 --> 00:21:41,150
Yeah.

276
00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:43,453
All right.

277
00:21:44,594 --> 00:21:47,392
You can go.

278
00:21:55,605 --> 00:21:57,903
You folks drive safe now, huh?

279
00:22:32,175 --> 00:22:34,541
Let's go, Tommy.

280
00:22:42,686 --> 00:22:44,586
It won't close.

281
00:22:45,755 --> 00:22:46,881
I can do that.

282
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:49,652
Dad, you couldn't even
get it open.

283
00:22:49,759 --> 00:22:52,660
Have respect for your father.
Give me the gun!

284
00:22:52,762 --> 00:22:55,424
Here. Now you can shoot
anybody you want.

285
00:22:55,532 --> 00:22:58,296
Dorri, that man
could've killed your mother.

286
00:22:58,401 --> 00:23:01,893
You think I should let crazy people
do what they want to us?

287
00:23:02,005 --> 00:23:03,495
Farhad, it won't close.

288
00:23:07,244 --> 00:23:10,645
Dorri, you should be at work.

289
00:23:22,058 --> 00:23:24,026
Who are you calling?

290
00:23:24,127 --> 00:23:26,755
I'm gonna report their asses.
Sons of bitches.

291
00:23:26,863 --> 00:23:30,856
You actually believe they're gonna take
anything you have to say seriously?

292
00:23:30,967 --> 00:23:35,870
Do you have any idea how that felt? To have
that pig's hands all over me?

293
00:23:35,972 --> 00:23:38,839
And you just stood there!

294
00:23:38,942 --> 00:23:41,035
And then you apologized
to him?

295
00:23:41,144 --> 00:23:44,045
What did you want me to do?
Get us both shot?

296
00:23:44,147 --> 00:23:47,639
They were gonna shoot us
on Ventura Boulevard! Pathetic.

297
00:23:47,751 --> 00:23:51,448
Well, maybe you would've been satisfied
with just being arrested.

298
00:23:51,554 --> 00:23:55,422
Oh, I get it. Much better to let him
shove his hand up my crotch

299
00:23:55,525 --> 00:23:58,323
than get your name
in the paper.

300
00:23:58,428 --> 00:24:00,623
You finally got me
figured out, 'cause see,

301
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:03,563
that's exactly
what I was worried about.

302
00:24:03,667 --> 00:24:06,659
Oh? You weren't afraid that all your good
friends at the studio

303
00:24:06,770 --> 00:24:10,638
were gonna read about you in the morning
and realize he's actually black?

304
00:24:12,275 --> 00:24:14,300
You need to calm down
right now.

305
00:24:14,411 --> 00:24:19,246
What I need is a husband who will not just
stand there while I am being molested!

306
00:24:19,349 --> 00:24:22,318
They were cops for God sakes!
They had guns!

307
00:24:23,987 --> 00:24:26,717
Maybe I should've let them
arrest your ass.

308
00:24:26,823 --> 00:24:30,589
Sooner or later you gotta find out
what it is really like to be black.

309
00:24:30,694 --> 00:24:33,424
Fuck you, man.
Like you know.

310
00:24:33,530 --> 00:24:37,227
The closest you ever came to being black,
Cameron, was watching The Cosby Show.

311
00:24:37,334 --> 00:24:40,428
At least I wasn't watching it with
the rest of the equestrian team.

312
00:24:40,537 --> 00:24:42,698
You're right, Cameron.
I got a lot to learn

313
00:24:42,806 --> 00:24:45,900
'cause I haven't quite learned
how to shuck and jive.

314
00:24:46,009 --> 00:24:48,876
Let me hear it again.
Thank you, mister policeman.

315
00:24:48,978 --> 00:24:51,708
You sure is mighty kind
to us poor black folk.

316
00:24:51,815 --> 00:24:56,343
You be sure to let me know next time
you wanna finger-fuck my wife.

317
00:24:57,887 --> 00:25:00,856
How the fuck do you say
something like that to me?

318
00:25:02,058 --> 00:25:04,618
You know, fuck you!

319
00:25:05,662 --> 00:25:08,927
That's good. A little anger.
It's a bit late, but it's nice to see!

320
00:25:58,748 --> 00:25:59,772
How's it goin'

321
00:25:59,883 --> 00:26:01,612
Okay.

322
00:26:01,718 --> 00:26:03,845
You didn't get scared
or something, did you?

323
00:26:03,953 --> 00:26:06,751
There's no monsters in the closet, right?
'Cause I hate monsters.

324
00:26:06,856 --> 00:26:09,825
There's no such thing
as monsters.

325
00:26:09,926 --> 00:26:13,521
- Ah, that's a good thing.
- I heard a bang.

326
00:26:13,630 --> 00:26:15,222
Like a truck bang?

327
00:26:15,331 --> 00:26:17,424
Like a gun.

328
00:26:24,674 --> 00:26:28,508
That's funny, 'cause we moved
outta that bad neighborhood.

329
00:26:28,611 --> 00:26:32,707
And there's not
too many guns around here.

330
00:26:32,816 --> 00:26:35,182
How far can bullets go?

331
00:26:35,285 --> 00:26:37,253
They go pretty far.

332
00:26:37,353 --> 00:26:40,254
But they usually get stuck
in something and stop.

333
00:26:40,356 --> 00:26:41,914
What if they don't?

334
00:26:42,025 --> 00:26:45,791
You thinking about that bullet that came
through your window?

335
00:27:03,306 --> 00:27:05,467
You think
we should move again?

336
00:27:05,575 --> 00:27:06,542
I like it here.

337
00:27:06,643 --> 00:27:10,602
Me too. But if that bullet found out
where we lived...

338
00:27:10,713 --> 00:27:11,702
Oh, hold on.

339
00:27:11,814 --> 00:27:13,304
What?

340
00:27:13,416 --> 00:27:15,509
So stupid!
How can I forget this?

341
00:27:15,618 --> 00:27:17,882
What?

342
00:27:19,322 --> 00:27:21,517
Nah. Forget it.
You ain't gonna believe me.

343
00:27:21,624 --> 00:27:24,115
Tell me.

344
00:27:24,227 --> 00:27:26,661
Okay.

345
00:27:26,763 --> 00:27:29,630
When I was five, this fairy
came into my room one night.

346
00:27:29,732 --> 00:27:33,099
- Right.
- I told you, you weren't gonna believe me.

347
00:27:33,202 --> 00:27:35,693
- Okay, go to sleep now, you little rat.
- No, tell me.

348
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:40,104
Okay.

349
00:27:40,209 --> 00:27:45,476
So this fairy comes into my room and I'm like,
"Yeah, right, you're a fairy."

350
00:27:45,581 --> 00:27:47,606
Anyway, we're talking, you know.

351
00:27:47,717 --> 00:27:50,811
And she's flying all around the room,
knocking down all my posters and stuff.

352
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:53,286
She was flying?

353
00:27:53,389 --> 00:27:56,017
She had these little stubby wings.
She could've glued 'em on, you know?

354
00:27:56,125 --> 00:27:58,753
Like I'm gonna believe she's a fairy.

355
00:27:58,861 --> 00:28:00,829
So she said, "I'll prove it."

356
00:28:00,930 --> 00:28:03,524
So she reaches
into her backpack.

357
00:28:03,633 --> 00:28:05,769
And she pulls out
this invisible cloak.

358
00:28:05,869 --> 00:28:10,465
She ties it around my neck,
and she tells me that it's impenetrable.

359
00:28:10,573 --> 00:28:12,803
You know what
impenetrable means?

360
00:28:12,909 --> 00:28:14,774
It means that nothing
can go through it.

361
00:28:14,878 --> 00:28:17,142
No bullets. Nothing.

362
00:28:17,247 --> 00:28:21,047
She told me that if I wore it,
nothing would hurt me.

363
00:28:21,150 --> 00:28:26,110
So I did. And my whole life,
I never got shot, stabbed.

364
00:28:26,222 --> 00:28:29,191
Nothing.
I mean, how weird is that?

365
00:28:29,292 --> 00:28:33,228
Only she told me that I was supposed to give it
to my daughter on her fifth birthday.

366
00:28:33,329 --> 00:28:35,092
And I forgot.

367
00:28:35,198 --> 00:28:36,688
Can I touch it?

368
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:38,858
Sure, go ahead.

369
00:28:41,237 --> 00:28:44,263
- I don't feel it.
- Yeah. It's pretty cool, huh?

370
00:28:44,374 --> 00:28:48,242
I can take it off and tie it around your
shoulders. She told me how to do it.

371
00:28:48,344 --> 00:28:51,973
- Unless you think it's stupid.
- Don't you need it?

372
00:28:52,081 --> 00:28:54,879
No, not anymore.

373
00:28:54,984 --> 00:28:57,919
So what do you think?
You want it?

374
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:05,991
Okay, let's get outta here.

375
00:29:11,801 --> 00:29:13,962
Okay.

376
00:29:26,716 --> 00:29:29,310
Put your head up.

377
00:29:34,290 --> 00:29:36,952
Okay. Is that too tight?

378
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:39,551
Do you feel anything at all?

379
00:29:39,662 --> 00:29:42,062
Good. Then
it's just right.

380
00:29:48,338 --> 00:29:50,829
Do I take it off
when I have a bath?

381
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:53,704
No, you leave it on
all the time.

382
00:29:53,810 --> 00:29:59,180
Until you have a daughter when she turns five,
then you give it to her.

383
00:29:59,282 --> 00:30:01,409
Okay?

384
00:30:01,517 --> 00:30:04,782
Okay.

385
00:30:04,887 --> 00:30:08,323
Okay.
Good night, sweetie.

386
00:30:09,559 --> 00:30:11,220
Good night.

387
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:54,736
Nah, nah. You wanna listen to music
of the oppressor, you go right ahead, man.

388
00:30:54,837 --> 00:30:58,864
How in the lunacy of your mind is hip-hop
music of the oppressor?

389
00:30:58,975 --> 00:31:02,240
Listen to it, man!
"Nigger this, nigger that."

390
00:31:02,345 --> 00:31:05,781
You think white people go around calling
each other honkies all day, man?

391
00:31:05,882 --> 00:31:07,406
"Hey, honky, how's business?"

392
00:31:07,517 --> 00:31:09,417
"Going great, cracker.
We're diversifying."

393
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:14,388
How 'bout this, huh? Listen. You like that?
Man's singin' about lynchin' niggers.

394
00:31:14,490 --> 00:31:16,287
And you think there's
a difference, don't you? Huh?

395
00:31:16,392 --> 00:31:20,488
Gonna buy me a rope
and lynch me a nigger

396
00:31:20,596 --> 00:31:23,759
You have absolutely no idea where hip-hop
music comes from, do you?

397
00:31:23,866 --> 00:31:26,391
I'd shoot 'em dead first
but I done broke my trigger

398
00:31:26,502 --> 00:31:28,766
See, back in the '60s we had
smart, articulate black men.

399
00:31:28,871 --> 00:31:31,032
Gonna get out my sheet
Put my hood on my head

400
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:34,166
Like Huey Newton, Bobby Seale,
Eldridge Cleaver, Fred Hampton.

401
00:31:34,277 --> 00:31:35,642
Gonna string 'em up good

402
00:31:35,745 --> 00:31:37,542
These brothers were speaking out good,
and people were listening!

403
00:31:37,647 --> 00:31:39,342
Then they'll be dead

404
00:31:39,449 --> 00:31:41,440
Then the FBI said,
"No, we can't have that."

405
00:31:41,551 --> 00:31:44,281
Home of the brave
and the land of the free

406
00:31:44,387 --> 00:31:46,514
"Let's give the niggers this music
by a bunch of mumbling idiots

407
00:31:46,622 --> 00:31:49,420
and sooner or later,
they'll all copy it, and nobody

408
00:31:49,525 --> 00:31:51,459
will be able to understand
a fucking word they say.

409
00:31:51,561 --> 00:31:52,789
End of problem."

410
00:31:59,836 --> 00:32:01,997
What the fuck
was that, dog?

411
00:32:16,452 --> 00:32:18,682
- Holy shit!
- What?

412
00:32:18,788 --> 00:32:21,256
Man, we done ran over
a Chinaman.

413
00:32:21,357 --> 00:32:23,188
You're sayin' there's a Chinaman
under this truck?

414
00:32:23,292 --> 00:32:24,452
What part don't you understand?

415
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:27,393
There's a Chinaman stuck
underneath the fucking truck.

416
00:32:29,832 --> 00:32:33,598
- Help me.
- Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

417
00:32:33,703 --> 00:32:37,400
Ah, God. What the hell did he do,
just leap out in front of the truck?

418
00:32:37,507 --> 00:32:40,533
Man! This is so
completely fucked up.

419
00:32:40,643 --> 00:32:42,508
Oh, really? No shit!

420
00:32:42,612 --> 00:32:45,672
Okay, hold up.
Hold up, hold up, hold up.

421
00:32:45,782 --> 00:32:47,750
- Get back in the truck.
- What?

422
00:32:47,850 --> 00:32:50,045
- Yes, get back in the truck.
- You think we didn't drag him far enough?

423
00:32:50,153 --> 00:32:53,054
No, we gonna drive away.
And he gonna let go.

424
00:32:53,156 --> 00:32:54,817
He's not gonna let go, Anthony.

425
00:32:54,924 --> 00:32:58,018
You know why? Because he's stuck
underneath the fucking truck!

426
00:32:58,127 --> 00:33:03,360
Now, if he could've let go, he probably would've
considered that option half a block back.

427
00:33:03,466 --> 00:33:06,993
What you and I gotta do, just grab his arms
and pull him from underneath.

428
00:33:07,103 --> 00:33:08,695
You grab his arm,
it's gonna fall off.

429
00:33:08,805 --> 00:33:11,603
Then you gonna be standing in the street
holding a Chinaman's arm.

430
00:33:11,707 --> 00:33:14,437
Then what your ass
gonna do, huh?

431
00:33:14,544 --> 00:33:18,139
If we leave this man here, he dies.
Then we're up for murder charges.

432
00:33:18,247 --> 00:33:22,149
Just grab his arm.
We'll just pull him out.

433
00:33:26,989 --> 00:33:30,618
I don't wanna cause any problems, Lieutenant.
I just want a new partner.

434
00:33:30,726 --> 00:33:32,785
I understand.
Your partner's a racist prick.

435
00:33:32,895 --> 00:33:35,329
But you don't wanna stir up
any bad feelings with him.

436
00:33:35,431 --> 00:33:37,228
He's been on the force
for a long time.

437
00:33:37,333 --> 00:33:39,494
Seventeen years.

438
00:33:39,602 --> 00:33:41,832
And I do have
to work here, sir.

439
00:33:41,938 --> 00:33:44,338
So you don't mind that there's
a racist prick on the force.

440
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:47,409
You just don't want him
to ride in your car.

441
00:33:47,510 --> 00:33:50,308
If you need me to go on record
about this, sir, I will.

442
00:33:50,413 --> 00:33:52,244
That'd be great.
Write a full report.

443
00:33:52,348 --> 00:33:55,112
Because I'm anxious to
understand how an obvious bigot

444
00:33:55,218 --> 00:33:58,153
could've gone undetected
in this department for 17 years.

445
00:33:58,254 --> 00:34:00,415
Eleven of which he was under
my personal supervision.

446
00:34:00,523 --> 00:34:02,923
Which doesn't speak very highly
of my managerial skills.

447
00:34:03,025 --> 00:34:06,791
But that's not your concern.
I can't wait to read it.

448
00:34:06,896 --> 00:34:10,798
What if I said I wanted a new partner
for personal reasons?

449
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:14,165
So now you're saying he's not a racist prick,
you just don't like him.

450
00:34:14,270 --> 00:34:17,205
- Yes, sir.
- That's not a good enough reason.

451
00:34:17,306 --> 00:34:20,207
Then I guess I should think of a better one
and get back to you.

452
00:34:20,309 --> 00:34:23,176
So you think I'm asking you
to make one up.

453
00:34:23,279 --> 00:34:28,046
Uh, no, sir. I just can't
think of one... right now.

454
00:34:28,150 --> 00:34:30,243
You wanna know what I heard?

455
00:34:31,687 --> 00:34:33,746
I heard it was a case
of uncontrollable flatulence.

456
00:34:33,856 --> 00:34:36,051
You want me to say
he has flatulence?

457
00:34:36,158 --> 00:34:38,922
Not him. You. You have
uncontrollable flatulence.

458
00:34:39,028 --> 00:34:42,691
You're too embarrassed to ride with anybody
else so you're requesting a one-man car.

459
00:34:42,798 --> 00:34:45,426
I'm not... comfortable with that,
Lieutenant.

460
00:34:45,534 --> 00:34:48,469
I wouldn't be either. Which is why I understand
your need for privacy.

461
00:34:48,571 --> 00:34:52,337
Just like I'm sure you understand how hard
a black man has to work to get to,

462
00:34:52,441 --> 00:34:55,604
say, where I am, in a racist fucking
organization like the L.A.P.D.

463
00:34:55,711 --> 00:34:58,703
And how easily
that can be taken away.

464
00:34:58,814 --> 00:35:01,942
Now, that being said,
it's your decision.

465
00:35:02,051 --> 00:35:06,886
You can put your career and mine on the line
in pursuit of a just cause,

466
00:35:06,989 --> 00:35:10,891
or you can admit to having
an embarrassing problem

467
00:35:10,993 --> 00:35:13,291
of a personal nature.

468
00:35:16,666 --> 00:35:18,634
Fuck.

469
00:35:48,965 --> 00:35:51,160
Excuse me.

470
00:35:51,267 --> 00:35:53,861
Excuse me. Sir?

471
00:35:53,970 --> 00:35:55,904
You finished?

472
00:35:56,005 --> 00:35:59,133
I replaced the lock. But you got
a real problem with that door.

473
00:35:59,241 --> 00:36:01,709
You fix the lock?

474
00:36:01,811 --> 00:36:06,009
Nah, I replaced the lock.
But you gotta fix that door.

475
00:36:06,115 --> 00:36:09,516
- Just fix the lock!
- Sir, listen to me.

476
00:36:09,618 --> 00:36:12,712
What you need
is a new door.

477
00:36:12,822 --> 00:36:15,382
- I need new door?
- Yeah.

478
00:36:15,491 --> 00:36:17,959
Okay. How much?

479
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:21,928
I don't... Sir, you're gonna have to call
somebody that sells doors.

480
00:36:22,031 --> 00:36:26,161
You try to cheat me, right?
You have a friend that fix door?

481
00:36:26,268 --> 00:36:28,395
Nah, I don't have a friend
that fix doors, bro.

482
00:36:28,504 --> 00:36:30,836
Then go and fix
the fucking lock, you cheater.

483
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:33,704
You... You know what?

484
00:36:33,809 --> 00:36:37,336
Why don't you just pay for the lock
and I won't charge you for the time.

485
00:36:37,446 --> 00:36:39,846
You don't fix the lock!
I pay! You think I'm stupid?

486
00:36:39,949 --> 00:36:43,043
You fix the fucking lock,
you cheater!

487
00:36:43,152 --> 00:36:45,712
- I'd appreciate if you'd stop calling me names.
- Then fix the fucking lock!

488
00:36:45,821 --> 00:36:49,188
I replaced the lock!
You gotta fix the fucking door!

489
00:36:49,291 --> 00:36:52,522
You cheat!
You fucking cheater!

490
00:36:52,628 --> 00:36:55,358
- Fine. Don't pay.
- What?

491
00:36:55,464 --> 00:36:58,194
- Have a good night.
- What? No. Wait!

492
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:01,269
Wait! You come back here!
You fix the lock!

493
00:37:01,370 --> 00:37:05,238
Come here! You fix my lock!
Fix the fucking lock!

494
00:37:11,414 --> 00:37:15,441
I understand. You run over a Chinaman.
Stuff him in the back.

495
00:37:15,551 --> 00:37:18,418
Then bring the truck here
so I can share in the experience.

496
00:37:18,521 --> 00:37:21,285
Come on, man. It's a little bit of blood.
It'll wash right off.

497
00:37:21,390 --> 00:37:23,756
- Georgie, burn this thing.
- Burn it?

498
00:37:23,859 --> 00:37:26,089
It's a brand-new Navigator.
All you need is a little piece of carpet.

499
00:37:26,195 --> 00:37:28,129
You watch the Discovery Channel?

500
00:37:28,230 --> 00:37:31,631
- Not a lot.
- They got some good shit on that channel.

501
00:37:31,734 --> 00:37:35,329
Every night there is a show with somebody
shining a blue light

502
00:37:35,438 --> 00:37:39,636
and finding tiny specks of blood splattered
on carpets and walls and ceiling fans,

503
00:37:39,742 --> 00:37:44,304
bathroom fixtures and special-edition plastic
Burger King tray cups.

504
00:37:44,413 --> 00:37:47,871
The next thing they show is some
stupid redneck in handcuffs

505
00:37:47,983 --> 00:37:52,181
who looks absolutely stunned
that this is happening to him.

506
00:37:52,288 --> 00:37:55,314
Sometimes the redneck is actually
watching the Discovery Channel

507
00:37:55,424 --> 00:37:57,415
when they break in
to arrest him.

508
00:37:57,526 --> 00:38:02,759
And he still can't figure out how on earth
they could've caught him!

509
00:38:10,739 --> 00:38:14,641
Do I look like I wanna be
on the Discovery Channel?

510
00:38:14,743 --> 00:38:16,005
No.

511
00:38:16,112 --> 00:38:18,910
Then get the fuck
outta my shop.

512
00:38:21,117 --> 00:38:23,278
Oh, yeah, make sure
you get that.

513
00:38:23,385 --> 00:38:26,752
Without him, things could've gone really
fucking wrong tonight.

514
00:38:29,024 --> 00:38:32,619
- Fuck!
- Don't! Don't you dare.

515
00:38:32,728 --> 00:38:34,593
Don't.

516
00:38:34,697 --> 00:38:37,791
Graham Waters.

517
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:42,166
No. No, he's not here, Mom.

518
00:38:43,606 --> 00:38:46,598
I'm not gonna go
looking for him.

519
00:38:46,709 --> 00:38:50,008
Look, he'll be home when...
Just leave it alone.

520
00:38:50,112 --> 00:38:54,776
Mom, I can't talk to you right now, okay?
I'm having sex with a white woman.

521
00:38:54,884 --> 00:38:57,318
Okay, where were we?

522
00:38:57,419 --> 00:38:59,887
I was white, and you were
about to jerk off in the shower.

523
00:39:00,318 --> 00:39:03,185
Oh, shit!

524
00:39:03,287 --> 00:39:05,414
Come on.

525
00:39:05,523 --> 00:39:10,483
I would've said you were Mexican, but I don't
think it would've pissed her off as much.

526
00:39:10,595 --> 00:39:12,859
Why do you keep everybody
at a certain distance, huh?

527
00:39:12,964 --> 00:39:16,695
- What, you start to feel something and panic?
- Come on, Maria.

528
00:39:16,801 --> 00:39:20,259
You're just pissed
'cause I answered the phone.

529
00:39:20,371 --> 00:39:22,669
That's just where
I begin to get pissed.

530
00:39:22,773 --> 00:39:26,174
I mean, really, what kind of man
speaks to his mother that way?

531
00:39:26,277 --> 00:39:30,338
Oh, this is about my mother.
What do you know about my mother?

532
00:39:30,448 --> 00:39:33,315
If I was your father,
I'd kick your fucking ass.

533
00:39:34,785 --> 00:39:36,776
Okay. I was raised badly.

534
00:39:36,888 --> 00:39:40,324
Why don't you take your clothes off,
get back into bed and teach me a lesson?

535
00:39:40,424 --> 00:39:44,383
You want a lesson? I'll give you a lesson.
How 'bout a geography lesson?

536
00:39:44,495 --> 00:39:48,625
My father's from Puerto Rico.
My mother's from El Salvador.

537
00:39:48,733 --> 00:39:51,793
Neither one of those is Mexico.

538
00:39:51,903 --> 00:39:54,337
Ah. Then I guess
the big mystery is

539
00:39:54,438 --> 00:39:57,930
who gathered all those remarkably
different cultures together

540
00:39:58,042 --> 00:40:01,068
and taught them all how to park
their cars on their lawns?

541
00:40:28,839 --> 00:40:31,205
Pop, you okay?

542
00:40:31,309 --> 00:40:34,335
If I could piss, I'd be okay.

543
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:38,610
I'm... Jesus.

544
00:40:38,716 --> 00:40:41,207
I'm done now.

545
00:40:41,319 --> 00:40:43,344
Give me a hand.

546
00:40:45,790 --> 00:40:47,781
Wait a goddamn minute!

547
00:40:47,892 --> 00:40:50,554
- Wait a minute.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

548
00:40:52,530 --> 00:40:55,988
All right. Okay. Okay.

549
00:41:03,374 --> 00:41:06,036
Wait, wait, wait.
Stop, stop!

550
00:41:06,143 --> 00:41:08,805
- I gotta go back.
- Okay.

551
00:41:21,158 --> 00:41:24,184
What, are you gonna
stand there and stare at me?

552
00:42:33,164 --> 00:42:35,792
- So Conklin just shot him?
- Mm-hmm.

553
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:38,835
- They know each other? It's a grudge thing?
- Sir.

554
00:42:38,936 --> 00:42:41,564
Not as far as we can tell.

555
00:42:41,672 --> 00:42:43,970
You think this is
racially motivated?

556
00:42:44,075 --> 00:42:47,408
Well, a dozen people heard the shots.
Nobody saw anything.

557
00:42:47,511 --> 00:42:49,479
- Who do we have on it?
- Graham Waters.

558
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:53,573
Waters. Tell him he speaks
to no one but me.

559
00:42:53,684 --> 00:42:56,847
Call a press conference for 4:00,
and I want Waters here at 3:30.

560
00:42:56,954 --> 00:42:58,854
And would someone
please find Flanagan.

561
00:43:00,891 --> 00:43:04,122
Oh! What up, Mo Phat?

562
00:43:04,228 --> 00:43:08,597
Man robs purses from old ladies and you,
"Hey, how's it goin', Mo Phat?"

563
00:43:08,699 --> 00:43:11,725
That nigger will steal teeth
from a cripple, man.

564
00:43:11,836 --> 00:43:14,361
You callin' him a thief?
And we do what?

565
00:43:14,472 --> 00:43:16,440
The man steals
from black people.

566
00:43:16,540 --> 00:43:18,872
Only reason black people
steal from their own

567
00:43:18,976 --> 00:43:21,604
- is 'cause they terrified of white people.
- Man, please.

568
00:43:21,712 --> 00:43:25,546
Think about it. Sherman Oaks.
Burbank. Santa Monica.

569
00:43:25,649 --> 00:43:28,209
All scary-ass places
for a brother to find himself.

570
00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:30,719
Drop Mo Phat at a Starbucks
in Toluca Lake,

571
00:43:30,821 --> 00:43:34,951
that nigger will run like a rabbit soon
as somebody say "decaf latte."

572
00:43:35,059 --> 00:43:38,290
What the fuck did you do to my car?

573
00:43:45,736 --> 00:43:49,103
Sorry I take your car, Miss Jean.

574
00:43:49,206 --> 00:43:52,175
I turn key to my car,
but nothing.

575
00:43:52,276 --> 00:43:54,210
James wanted
to take this to school.

576
00:43:54,311 --> 00:43:57,007
But I don't want the kids
to fight over it.

577
00:43:57,114 --> 00:44:00,880
- Are these clean or dirty?
- All clean, senora!

578
00:44:00,985 --> 00:44:05,922
You know, Maria, just once I would like to
wake up and find these dishes in the cabinet.

579
00:44:07,258 --> 00:44:09,818
Si, senora.
No problem.

580
00:44:10,861 --> 00:44:12,328
I'm startin' to understand now.

581
00:44:12,429 --> 00:44:16,229
By your work, you're settin'
an example for our neighborhood.

582
00:44:16,333 --> 00:44:18,824
Sort of like a big brother
kind of thing, right?

583
00:44:20,037 --> 00:44:21,334
Yeah, you laugh, man.

584
00:44:21,438 --> 00:44:25,499
But you have never seen me steal
from a black person ever in your life.

585
00:44:27,545 --> 00:44:30,036
What the hell do you think
you doin' right now, man?

586
00:44:30,147 --> 00:44:31,478
Wavin' down the bus.

587
00:44:31,582 --> 00:44:33,880
Put your hand down, dog!
Are you outta your mind?

588
00:44:33,984 --> 00:44:36,350
You actually expect me
to get on a bus?

589
00:44:36,453 --> 00:44:38,717
No. I was hopin' we could
push your car across town.

590
00:44:38,823 --> 00:44:40,757
You know why? 'Cause we just
don't do stuff like that no more.

591
00:44:40,858 --> 00:44:43,486
You have no idea, do you?

592
00:44:43,594 --> 00:44:47,086
You have no idea why they put them great
big windows on the sides of buses, do you?

593
00:44:47,198 --> 00:44:49,758
- Why?
- One reason only.

594
00:44:49,867 --> 00:44:54,167
To humiliate the people of color
who are reduced to ridin' on 'em.

595
00:44:54,271 --> 00:44:55,636
I didn't know that.

596
00:44:55,739 --> 00:44:58,708
You could fill the Staples Center
with what you don't know.

597
00:44:58,809 --> 00:45:00,777
You know the Kings
are playin' tonight.

598
00:45:00,878 --> 00:45:04,245
You don't like hockey! The only reason
you say you do is to piss me off!

599
00:45:04,348 --> 00:45:06,680
I love hockey.

600
00:45:06,784 --> 00:45:08,376
Cut! Print. Moving on.

601
00:45:08,485 --> 00:45:12,683
Okay, that takes us into scene 12.

602
00:45:12,790 --> 00:45:15,884
Jamal, that's what
I'm talking about.

603
00:45:15,993 --> 00:45:19,121
Right on.

604
00:45:19,230 --> 00:45:22,597
- Cam, you got a second?
- Yeah, Fred, I just wanna grab some coffee.

605
00:45:22,700 --> 00:45:25,464
Yeah. Listen.
I think we need another take, buddy.

606
00:45:25,569 --> 00:45:28,299
That looked pretty terrific, man.

607
00:45:28,405 --> 00:45:32,569
This is gonna sound strange, but is Jamal
seeing a speech coach or something?

608
00:45:32,676 --> 00:45:34,610
What do you mean?

609
00:45:34,712 --> 00:45:38,170
Have you noticed, uh...
This is weird for a white guy to say,

610
00:45:38,282 --> 00:45:42,048
but have you noticed he's talking
a lot less black lately?

611
00:45:43,854 --> 00:45:45,617
No, I haven't noticed that.

612
00:45:45,723 --> 00:45:49,489
Really? Like in this scene, he was supposed
to say, "Don't be talkin' 'bout that."

613
00:45:49,593 --> 00:45:52,118
And he changed it to,
"Don't talk to me about that."

614
00:45:52,229 --> 00:45:53,560
Wait a minute.

615
00:45:53,664 --> 00:45:58,397
You think because of that, the audience
won't recognize him as being a black man?

616
00:45:58,502 --> 00:46:01,528
- Come on!
- Is there a problem, Cam?

617
00:46:01,639 --> 00:46:03,231
Excuse me?

618
00:46:03,340 --> 00:46:05,706
Is there a problem, Cam?

619
00:46:10,614 --> 00:46:13,139
No, we don't have
a problem.

620
00:46:13,250 --> 00:46:16,515
I mean, 'cause all I'm saying is,
it's not his character.

621
00:46:16,620 --> 00:46:19,214
Eddie's supposed to be
the smart one, not Jamal, right?

622
00:46:19,323 --> 00:46:23,054
You're the expert here.
But to me, it rings false.

623
00:46:26,397 --> 00:46:30,197
- We're gonna do it one more time.
- Thanks, buddy.

624
00:46:30,301 --> 00:46:34,237
Everybody back to one, please.
Let's do it one more time.

625
00:46:36,774 --> 00:46:38,867
Jamal, um...

626
00:46:42,379 --> 00:46:44,711
Morning, Carol.
Who do I have?

627
00:46:44,815 --> 00:46:47,613
Hold for a minute, please.
Mr. Trujillo called and cancelled,

628
00:46:47,718 --> 00:46:50,448
but you have a walk-in,
Mr. Ryan.

629
00:46:53,724 --> 00:46:56,454
Send him in.

630
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:58,858
- Mr. Ryan.
- Yeah.

631
00:46:58,963 --> 00:47:01,124
My name is Shaniqua Johnson.

632
00:47:01,231 --> 00:47:03,791
I believe we spoke last night.

633
00:47:03,901 --> 00:47:07,200
Oh, yeah. I wanted
to apologize about that.

634
00:47:07,304 --> 00:47:10,501
I haven't been gettin' too much sleep.
My father's in a lot of pain.

635
00:47:10,607 --> 00:47:13,132
Oh! I'm sorry to hear that.

636
00:47:13,243 --> 00:47:17,407
This doctor he's been seein' says
he's got a urinary tract infection.

637
00:47:17,514 --> 00:47:20,972
But he's been takin' this medicine for a month,
and he keeps gettin' worse.

638
00:47:21,085 --> 00:47:23,076
And he's been back to see
Dr. Robertson?

639
00:47:23,187 --> 00:47:25,883
Yeah. Between you and me,
the man's an idiot.

640
00:47:25,990 --> 00:47:27,924
- Really?
- No offense.

641
00:47:28,025 --> 00:47:31,517
But the guy sees 100 patients an hour.
I think his nurses are doing most of the work.

642
00:47:31,628 --> 00:47:36,656
Mmm. If you're unhappy, your father's
welcome to see a doctor outside the network.

643
00:47:36,767 --> 00:47:41,170
And if this new doctor
says it's not an infection,

644
00:47:41,271 --> 00:47:44,399
says it's his prostate and it needs to be
operated on, is that gonna be covered?

645
00:47:44,508 --> 00:47:48,137
- Not unless Dr. Robertson authorizes...
- What good is that gonna do?

646
00:47:48,245 --> 00:47:50,907
I'm sorry. There's nothing else I can do.

647
00:47:51,015 --> 00:47:54,576
All right.
You know what I can't do?

648
00:47:54,685 --> 00:47:57,279
I can't look at you without
thinking about the five or six

649
00:47:57,388 --> 00:47:59,788
more qualified white men
who didn't get your job.

650
00:47:59,890 --> 00:48:01,619
It's time for you to go.

651
00:48:01,725 --> 00:48:04,819
I'm saying this 'cause I'm hoping
that I'm wrong about you.

652
00:48:04,928 --> 00:48:06,725
I'm hoping that someone like yourself,

653
00:48:06,830 --> 00:48:08,889
someone who may have
been given a helping hand,

654
00:48:08,999 --> 00:48:11,797
might have a little compassion
for someone in a similar situation.

655
00:48:11,902 --> 00:48:14,063
Carol, I need security
in my office!

656
00:48:14,171 --> 00:48:17,265
You don't like me,
that's fine. I'm a prick.

657
00:48:17,374 --> 00:48:19,934
My father doesn't deserve
to suffer like this.

658
00:48:20,044 --> 00:48:22,012
He was a janitor.
He struggled his whole life.

659
00:48:22,112 --> 00:48:23,943
Saved enough to start
his own company.

660
00:48:24,048 --> 00:48:26,016
Twenty-three employees,
all of them black.

661
00:48:26,116 --> 00:48:28,812
Paid 'em equal wages when
no one else was doing that.

662
00:48:28,919 --> 00:48:33,913
For 30 years he worked side by side with
those men, sweeping and carrying garbage.

663
00:48:34,024 --> 00:48:35,787
Then the city council decides

664
00:48:35,893 --> 00:48:39,124
to give minority-owned companies
preference in city contracts.

665
00:48:39,229 --> 00:48:41,993
And overnight,
my father loses everything.

666
00:48:42,099 --> 00:48:45,500
His business, his home,
his wife. Everything!

667
00:48:45,602 --> 00:48:49,299
Not once does he blame
your people.

668
00:48:49,406 --> 00:48:52,864
I'm not asking you
to help me.

669
00:48:52,976 --> 00:48:57,310
I'm asking that you do this small thing
for a man who lost everything

670
00:48:57,414 --> 00:48:59,746
so people like yourself
could reap the benefits.

671
00:48:59,850 --> 00:49:02,148
And do you know
what it's gonna cost you?

672
00:49:02,252 --> 00:49:04,186
Nothing.

673
00:49:04,288 --> 00:49:06,279
Just a flick of your pen.

674
00:49:07,858 --> 00:49:10,793
Your father sounds like
a good man.

675
00:49:10,894 --> 00:49:15,024
And if he'd come in here today, I probably
would've approved this request.

676
00:49:15,132 --> 00:49:19,592
But he didn't come in. You did.
And for his sake, it's a real shame.

677
00:49:19,703 --> 00:49:22,604
- Get him the hell outta my office.
- Prick.

678
00:49:29,713 --> 00:49:34,377
Sir, I spoke to our employee, and he told you
you needed to replace or repair the door.

679
00:49:34,485 --> 00:49:35,975
He say he fix the lock.

680
00:49:36,086 --> 00:49:38,816
- You come here, see how "fix-ed" it is!
- You're yelling again.

681
00:49:38,922 --> 00:49:40,822
I am not yelling!
I'm upset!

682
00:49:40,924 --> 00:49:43,290
Yes... Yes, I am.

683
00:49:43,393 --> 00:49:45,020
Mom, are you all right?

684
00:49:45,129 --> 00:49:49,395
Stop washing.
Insurance must take picture.

685
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:52,264
Okay?

686
00:49:52,369 --> 00:49:54,735
Look what they wrote.

687
00:49:54,838 --> 00:49:56,863
They think we're Arab.

688
00:49:56,974 --> 00:49:58,999
When did Persian
become Arab?

689
00:49:59,109 --> 00:50:01,942
I want his name. Yes.

690
00:50:02,045 --> 00:50:03,672
Oh, my God.

691
00:50:03,780 --> 00:50:06,806
- I want his name! Give me his name!
- Dad?

692
00:50:06,917 --> 00:50:08,316
I'm not giving you
his name, sir.

693
00:50:08,418 --> 00:50:12,184
- Dad, did they take the gun?
- Not fix my lock! I want his name!

694
00:50:12,289 --> 00:50:14,348
I'm gonna hang up now, sir.

695
00:50:14,458 --> 00:50:18,189
Don't hang up! Shit!

696
00:50:18,295 --> 00:50:20,126
Oh, thank God.

697
00:51:06,076 --> 00:51:09,011
Mom?

698
00:51:09,112 --> 00:51:11,342
Mom, it's cold.
Come on.

699
00:51:33,570 --> 00:51:35,868
Did you find your brother?

700
00:51:38,008 --> 00:51:40,135
No, Mom.

701
00:51:49,620 --> 00:51:52,145
I was doin' good.

702
00:51:52,256 --> 00:51:56,920
I was... I was doin' real good.

703
00:51:58,729 --> 00:52:02,495
- I know, Mom.
- I was doin'...

704
00:52:06,003 --> 00:52:07,937
It's okay.

705
00:52:19,383 --> 00:52:21,544
Did you find your brother?

706
00:52:23,820 --> 00:52:26,220
No, Mom.

707
00:52:27,557 --> 00:52:30,082
Tell him to come home.

708
00:52:31,495 --> 00:52:36,831
Tell him I'm not mad, okay?
Okay, baby?

709
00:52:36,933 --> 00:52:39,458
Okay, Mom.

710
00:52:39,569 --> 00:52:42,060
Okay, baby.

711
00:52:42,172 --> 00:52:43,764
Okay.

712
00:52:44,808 --> 00:52:46,833
Okay.

713
00:53:22,479 --> 00:53:25,414
- Did you apologize to your mother?
- She wasn't there.

714
00:53:27,384 --> 00:53:31,013
Internal Affairs called. Found something
in the Mercedes.

715
00:53:33,790 --> 00:53:37,317
That's lunch. One hour.

716
00:54:05,188 --> 00:54:07,315
I tried to call.

717
00:54:07,424 --> 00:54:11,918
- Sounded like you're havin' a bad day, huh?
- Yeah.

718
00:54:15,265 --> 00:54:17,961
What?

719
00:54:18,068 --> 00:54:19,968
I got scared, Cam.

720
00:54:20,070 --> 00:54:25,531
It's not like I haven't been pulled over before.
You know?

721
00:54:25,642 --> 00:54:27,633
But not like that.

722
00:54:28,979 --> 00:54:30,970
And, yes,
I was a little drunk.

723
00:54:31,081 --> 00:54:35,017
And I was mouthing off.

724
00:54:35,118 --> 00:54:37,313
I'm sorry.

725
00:54:39,423 --> 00:54:41,186
But when that man was putting
his hands on me...

726
00:54:41,291 --> 00:54:42,918
I don't wanna talk about it.

727
00:54:43,026 --> 00:54:46,462
I can't believe
you let him do that, baby.

728
00:54:46,563 --> 00:54:51,398
Look, I know what you did
was the right thing. Okay?

729
00:54:52,936 --> 00:54:55,632
But I was humiliated!

730
00:54:55,739 --> 00:54:57,900
For you.

731
00:54:58,008 --> 00:55:02,536
I just couldn't stand to see that man
take away your dignity.

732
00:55:02,646 --> 00:55:05,638
Yeah. That's what happened.

733
00:55:05,749 --> 00:55:08,775
- Oh, baby, don't do this.
- No. No, you're right.

734
00:55:08,885 --> 00:55:10,648
I ain't doin' it.

735
00:55:10,754 --> 00:55:13,279
You gonna walk away
from me?

736
00:55:13,390 --> 00:55:16,655
- Cameron!
- Just go home.

737
00:55:22,699 --> 00:55:26,430
Mm-hmm. I understand.

738
00:55:28,505 --> 00:55:30,473
Thanks.

739
00:55:33,109 --> 00:55:36,510
- Has your father read his policy?
- He doesn't read English.

740
00:55:40,350 --> 00:55:42,614
Mr. Golzari, you said
you called the locksmith?

741
00:55:44,154 --> 00:55:45,678
Yes. I tell him, fix it.

742
00:55:45,789 --> 00:55:49,452
They said their man told you

743
00:55:50,594 --> 00:55:52,858
to fix the door,
and you didn't do so.

744
00:55:54,865 --> 00:55:57,163
Are you saying it's his fault?

745
00:55:58,201 --> 00:56:02,604
Insurance company is calling it negligence.
They're not covering this.

746
00:56:11,448 --> 00:56:15,544
No. This store is all we have.

747
00:56:32,636 --> 00:56:34,695
I really am sorry.

748
00:56:57,227 --> 00:56:59,388
What time
you must go to work?

749
00:56:59,496 --> 00:57:02,397
Not until tonight.

750
00:57:02,499 --> 00:57:03,966
Go home and sleep.

751
00:57:07,237 --> 00:57:09,865
It's okay. It's okay.
Go home and sleep.

752
00:57:33,096 --> 00:57:34,222
Hey.

753
00:57:35,966 --> 00:57:39,367
Maybe they didn't tell you,
but I've been reassigned.

754
00:57:39,469 --> 00:57:41,664
Yeah, they told me.

755
00:57:41,771 --> 00:57:44,569
I just wanted to say,
good luck

756
00:57:44,674 --> 00:57:46,505
and it was good
ridin' with you.

757
00:57:46,610 --> 00:57:48,271
You too.

758
00:57:51,281 --> 00:57:54,546
Wait till you've been on the job
a few more years.

759
00:57:54,651 --> 00:57:57,848
- Yeah.
- Look at me, look at me.

760
00:57:57,954 --> 00:58:02,584
Wait till you've been doin' it
a little longer.

761
00:58:02,692 --> 00:58:06,628
You think you know
who you are, hmm?

762
00:58:06,730 --> 00:58:09,563
You have no idea.

763
00:58:13,036 --> 00:58:16,130
Yo, Gomez,
you ready to roll, homie?

764
00:58:16,239 --> 00:58:18,070
Ready, amigo.

765
00:58:27,817 --> 00:58:30,843
2-1-L-2-3
Radio check, 2-1-L-2-3.

766
00:58:30,954 --> 00:58:35,618
21-L-23
21-L-23, picking up strange noises
from your car.

767
00:58:35,725 --> 00:58:39,525
21-L, is your mike open
by any chance?

768
01:00:50,801 --> 01:00:52,666
Call it in.

769
01:01:30,173 --> 01:01:31,970
Ma'am?

770
01:01:32,075 --> 01:01:34,100
Can you hear me?

771
01:01:34,211 --> 01:01:36,645
Paramedics are rolling.
They'll be here in two minutes.

772
01:01:36,747 --> 01:01:39,807
- Get an extinguisher, and get that fire out.
- Jesus.

773
01:01:43,487 --> 01:01:46,888
Ma'am, are you hurt?

774
01:01:46,990 --> 01:01:50,050
- Can you move?
- L... I can't breathe.

775
01:01:53,130 --> 01:01:56,156
Okay, I'm gonna get you out.

776
01:02:02,939 --> 01:02:04,406
It's okay.

777
01:02:08,678 --> 01:02:11,169
Okay. Okay.

778
01:02:11,281 --> 01:02:13,181
Okay, I'm gonna get
you out.

779
01:02:17,521 --> 01:02:19,489
No!

780
01:02:19,589 --> 01:02:22,649
- It's okay.
- Get away from me!

781
01:02:22,759 --> 01:02:25,819
Get away.
Stay away from me!

782
01:02:25,929 --> 01:02:29,194
Not you! Not you!

783
01:02:29,299 --> 01:02:32,097
- It's okay.
- Don't touch me! Don't touch me!

784
01:02:32,202 --> 01:02:35,797
- Keep away from me!
- Lady, I'm tryin'- - I'm tryin' to help you.

785
01:02:35,906 --> 01:02:38,431
Fuck you!
Not you!

786
01:02:38,542 --> 01:02:41,511
Somebody!
Anybody else!

787
01:02:41,611 --> 01:02:45,274
- Please, somebody! Not you!
- Stop moving!

788
01:02:45,382 --> 01:02:48,874
No! Get your filthy
fucking hands off me!

789
01:02:48,985 --> 01:02:53,149
Stop moving. Lady, I'm not
gonna fucking hurt you!

790
01:02:58,128 --> 01:03:00,562
Okay. Okay.

791
01:03:00,664 --> 01:03:03,189
Please don't touch me. Don't, don't.

792
01:03:03,300 --> 01:03:07,100
I'm not gonna touch you.
But there's nobody else here yet

793
01:03:07,204 --> 01:03:09,229
and that's gasoline there.

794
01:03:10,841 --> 01:03:14,140
We need to get you
outta here right away. Okay?

795
01:03:14,244 --> 01:03:16,439
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

796
01:03:16,546 --> 01:03:22,314
Okay. I need to reach across your lap.
Can I do that, please?

797
01:03:25,522 --> 01:03:27,490
Yeah. Yeah.

798
01:03:28,892 --> 01:03:30,553
Thanks.

799
01:03:34,531 --> 01:03:38,297
Is anything broken?

800
01:03:38,401 --> 01:03:40,835
L-I don't think so.

801
01:03:40,937 --> 01:03:43,838
Okay. Then that's good.

802
01:03:43,940 --> 01:03:46,465
Are you... Are you
gonna get me out?

803
01:03:46,576 --> 01:03:49,841
Yeah, I'm gonna get
you out. Okay?

804
01:03:49,946 --> 01:03:53,279
Look at me. Look at me.
I'm gonna get you out.

805
01:03:58,655 --> 01:04:00,953
Oh, fuck!

806
01:04:01,057 --> 01:04:04,049
- I'm sorry.
- That's okay.

807
01:04:06,229 --> 01:04:09,027
I'm gonna have to cut your belt, okay?

808
01:04:09,132 --> 01:04:11,225
I'm gonna have to cut the belt.

809
01:04:12,202 --> 01:04:13,829
It's okay, it's okay.

810
01:04:13,937 --> 01:04:16,633
It's okay. Okay,
we're gonna get you out.

811
01:04:16,740 --> 01:04:19,038
Everything's gonna be fine.
Look at me!

812
01:04:19,142 --> 01:04:21,633
Everything's gonna be fine.
We're gonna get you outta here.

813
01:04:21,745 --> 01:04:23,474
Everything's gonna be fine.

814
01:04:41,865 --> 01:04:42,661
Ryan!

815
01:05:17,801 --> 01:05:19,826
Pull!

816
01:05:33,750 --> 01:05:35,775
It's okay.

817
01:05:45,261 --> 01:05:47,559
It's okay.

818
01:05:47,664 --> 01:05:51,293
All right.
It's okay, it's okay.

819
01:05:51,401 --> 01:05:53,869
It's all right.
I got it. I got it.

820
01:05:53,970 --> 01:05:56,029
Ma'am? Ma'am,
can you walk with me?

821
01:05:56,139 --> 01:05:58,437
It's cool, it's cool.

822
01:05:59,843 --> 01:06:02,869
Here we go. All right,
you're doin' great.

823
01:06:33,877 --> 01:06:37,278
The D.A. Wanted me to apologize.
He really wanted to be here himself.

824
01:06:37,380 --> 01:06:40,110
No, he didn't! If he did his own dirty work none
of us would have jobs.

825
01:06:40,216 --> 01:06:42,480
- Jake Flanagan. I work with Rick.
- Graham Waters.

826
01:06:42,585 --> 01:06:45,418
- Thanks for coming in.
- He just pulled into the garage.

827
01:06:45,522 --> 01:06:48,650
Great. Press conference is in ten minutes,
so we'll make this short.

828
01:06:48,758 --> 01:06:52,125
Internal Affairs says this Conklin has two
suspicious shootings on his record.

829
01:06:52,228 --> 01:06:55,493
Both black men. Both times he was cleared,
but only just.

830
01:06:55,598 --> 01:06:58,396
Detective Lewis
makes black man number three.

831
01:06:58,501 --> 01:07:01,959
You know any reason why we shouldn't
hang Conklin for this?

832
01:07:02,072 --> 01:07:07,169
Well, it's more complicated
than we originally thought.

833
01:07:07,277 --> 01:07:13,147
We found $300,000 in the trunk of the car
that Detective Lewis was driving.

834
01:07:13,249 --> 01:07:15,376
Shit!

835
01:07:15,485 --> 01:07:19,979
Ah. Go down to the garage. Tell him
to stay in the car until he hears from me.

836
01:07:20,090 --> 01:07:23,958
You found the money in the Mercedes.
I thought that wasn't his car.

837
01:07:24,060 --> 01:07:27,894
The car's registered to a Cindy Bradley.
We haven't been able to get in touch with her.

838
01:07:27,997 --> 01:07:31,489
Apparently she, uh,
left town this morning.

839
01:07:31,601 --> 01:07:35,367
So it wasn't Lewis's car. He may not
have known the money was in it.

840
01:07:41,744 --> 01:07:45,407
You really think you're gonna
be able to make that fly?

841
01:08:24,464 --> 01:08:25,931
Give us a minute.

842
01:08:27,167 --> 01:08:29,328
No problem.

843
01:08:36,843 --> 01:08:39,038
Who knows about the money?

844
01:08:39,146 --> 01:08:41,171
You gotta be kiddin' me.

845
01:08:41,281 --> 01:08:45,149
There are only two people
in this room.

846
01:08:45,252 --> 01:08:48,585
Myself, my partner,
Ferguson and Internal Affairs.

847
01:08:48,688 --> 01:08:51,179
- Jim Ferguson?
- Yeah.

848
01:08:55,762 --> 01:08:58,196
Okay. I guess
I don't see a problem.

849
01:08:58,298 --> 01:09:00,766
As it wasn't Lewis's car, the money isn't clear
evidence of any wrongdoing.

850
01:09:00,867 --> 01:09:03,836
And even if it was, we aren't going to
prosecute a dead man.

851
01:09:03,937 --> 01:09:08,397
Which means the money Internal Affairs
is holding can't be considered evidence.

852
01:09:08,508 --> 01:09:10,806
You can do this dance
if you want to,

853
01:09:10,911 --> 01:09:14,369
but I'm willing to bet when the coroner's report
comes back tomorrow

854
01:09:14,481 --> 01:09:17,450
it's going to say that Detective Lewis
was coked out of his head.

855
01:09:18,885 --> 01:09:20,352
Fucking black people, huh?

856
01:09:20,454 --> 01:09:22,513
What did you just say?

857
01:09:22,622 --> 01:09:24,590
I mean,

858
01:09:24,691 --> 01:09:27,216
I know all the sociological
reasons why per capita

859
01:09:27,327 --> 01:09:30,387
eight times more black men
are incarcerated than white men.

860
01:09:30,497 --> 01:09:34,365
Schools are a disgrace. Lack of opportunity.
Bias in the judicial system.

861
01:09:34,468 --> 01:09:36,436
All that stuff.
All that stuff!

862
01:09:36,536 --> 01:09:40,597
But still, it's gotta get to you,
on a gut level as a black man.

863
01:09:40,707 --> 01:09:43,642
They just can't keep their hands
out of the cookie jar.

864
01:09:48,348 --> 01:09:50,908
Of course, you and I know
that's not the truth.

865
01:09:51,017 --> 01:09:53,144
But that's the way
it always plays, doesn't it?

866
01:09:53,253 --> 01:09:56,689
And assholes like Lewis keep feeding
the flames. It's gotta get to you.

867
01:09:56,790 --> 01:10:00,248
What did you say
you did for the D.A. Again?

868
01:10:00,360 --> 01:10:02,260
You coach ball down in Compton.
Am I right?

869
01:10:02,362 --> 01:10:04,296
Oh, please, don't do that.

870
01:10:04,397 --> 01:10:07,230
Don't act like you know
something about me, okay?

871
01:10:07,334 --> 01:10:11,293
What do you think those kids need... to make
them believe, to give them hope?

872
01:10:11,404 --> 01:10:13,998
You think they need another
drug-dealing cop

873
01:10:14,107 --> 01:10:17,042
or do you think they need
a fallen black hero?

874
01:10:17,144 --> 01:10:21,740
Why don't you cut through the bullshit
and just tell me what it is you want.

875
01:10:23,750 --> 01:10:26,548
The D.A.'s squad loses
its lead investigator next month.

876
01:10:26,653 --> 01:10:30,521
Rick is quite adamant that his replacement
be a person of color.

877
01:10:30,624 --> 01:10:34,788
It's a high-profile position, and he wants
to send the right message to the community.

878
01:10:34,895 --> 01:10:38,558
And the right message is,
"Look at this black boy I just bought?"

879
01:10:38,665 --> 01:10:43,534
Well, fuck you very much.
But thanks for thinking of me.

880
01:10:43,637 --> 01:10:46,105
Actually we were thinking of you.

881
01:10:46,206 --> 01:10:49,403
Until we saw that.

882
01:10:49,509 --> 01:10:51,568
It's your brother's file.

883
01:10:51,678 --> 01:10:54,772
Twenty-something years old
and already three felonies.

884
01:10:54,881 --> 01:10:57,611
Three strikes law. Kid's going away
for life for stealing a car.

885
01:10:57,717 --> 01:11:00,379
Christ, that's a shitty law.

886
01:11:00,487 --> 01:11:02,421
There's a warrant in there.

887
01:11:02,522 --> 01:11:06,925
But still, hey, he had
every opportunity you had.

888
01:11:08,328 --> 01:11:11,661
Fucking black people, huh?

889
01:11:16,002 --> 01:11:20,462
So all, uh... all I need to do
to make this disappear

890
01:11:20,574 --> 01:11:22,872
is to frame
a potentially innocent man?

891
01:11:22,976 --> 01:11:26,275
What are you? The fucking defender
of all things white?

892
01:11:26,379 --> 01:11:30,110
We're talking about a white man
who shot three black men.

893
01:11:30,217 --> 01:11:34,950
And you're arguing with me that maybe
we're not being fair to him?

894
01:11:35,055 --> 01:11:37,990
You know what? Maybe you're right.
Maybe Lewis did provoke this.

895
01:11:38,091 --> 01:11:40,286
And maybe he got exactly
what was coming to him.

896
01:11:40,393 --> 01:11:43,385
Or maybe stoned or not,
just being a black man in the Valley

897
01:11:43,496 --> 01:11:45,794
was enough to get him killed.

898
01:11:45,899 --> 01:11:49,300
There was no one there to see who shot first,
so there is no way to know.

899
01:11:49,402 --> 01:11:53,532
Which means we
could get this wrong.

900
01:11:55,408 --> 01:11:58,468
Maybe that's what happened
with your brother. Maybe we got it wrong.

901
01:11:58,578 --> 01:12:02,981
Maybe Lewis isn't the only one
who deserves the benefit of the doubt.

902
01:12:03,083 --> 01:12:05,483
You're the one closest to all this.

903
01:12:05,585 --> 01:12:07,610
You need to tell us.

904
01:12:11,424 --> 01:12:13,858
What does your gut tell you?

905
01:12:26,606 --> 01:12:29,803
Graham?
So? Graham?

906
01:12:29,909 --> 01:12:32,036
What do I tell 'em?

907
01:12:32,145 --> 01:12:36,047
You tell me, and I'll tell them.

908
01:12:42,689 --> 01:12:46,853
Well, I think given
Detective Conklin's history,

909
01:12:46,960 --> 01:12:49,986
it's pretty clear
what happened last night.

910
01:12:50,096 --> 01:12:52,758
Okay.

911
01:13:09,382 --> 01:13:11,646
Before I get to why we're here,

912
01:13:11,751 --> 01:13:15,687
I know that many of you have heard we had
our car stolen last night.

913
01:13:15,789 --> 01:13:20,158
And as you could imagine, my wife and I
are both pretty shaken up.

914
01:13:20,260 --> 01:13:22,091
But we're okay.

915
01:13:22,195 --> 01:13:26,825
And Jean and I truly appreciate all your calls
and your concern. Thank you.

916
01:13:26,933 --> 01:13:32,530
Now, just after 9.'00 p.m. Last night,
Detective William Lewis,

917
01:13:32,639 --> 01:13:35,267
an eight-year veteran of the force and an
active member of the black community,

918
01:13:35,375 --> 01:13:39,505
was gunned down
by a fellow officer.

919
01:14:37,404 --> 01:14:39,235
Get outta the car!

920
01:14:39,339 --> 01:14:41,807
Gimme the keys!
Get out... What the fuck?

921
01:14:43,810 --> 01:14:45,835
Whoa! What the fuck
are you doing, man?

922
01:14:45,945 --> 01:14:47,810
Shit! You wanna get killed, nigger?

923
01:14:47,914 --> 01:14:50,815
Say that again!

924
01:14:50,917 --> 01:14:53,181
- Say that again!
- You stupid motherfucker!

925
01:14:53,286 --> 01:14:56,585
Say it again, huh!
Call me a nigger again!

926
01:14:56,689 --> 01:14:59,055
- Man, what the fuck? Get off!
- Fuck you!

927
01:14:59,159 --> 01:15:01,923
- Shoot him!
- I'll blow your head off!

928
01:15:02,028 --> 01:15:05,088
- Shoot this motherfucker!
- I swear to God, I'm gonna blow your head off!

929
01:15:05,198 --> 01:15:07,666
Stop talkin' and shoot!

930
01:15:07,767 --> 01:15:10,634
- Stop! Let's go! Here comes the po-po.
- Get off of me!

931
01:15:12,739 --> 01:15:15,503
Hey, hey! Where you goin', man? Hell, no!

932
01:15:15,608 --> 01:15:17,576
- Oh, shit.
- Anthony! Anthony!

933
01:15:19,946 --> 01:15:21,413
Get the fuck outta my car!

934
01:15:21,514 --> 01:15:23,778
Shit! Damn!

935
01:15:23,883 --> 01:15:26,078
- What are you doin', man? Get outta the car!
- Fuck you!

936
01:15:30,056 --> 01:15:34,015
Car 25 in pursuit of a black Navigator.
West bound.

937
01:15:39,632 --> 01:15:43,966
2-2 Ida Tom Adam 3...
Oh, Christ!

938
01:15:49,542 --> 01:15:51,737
- Get the fuck outta the car!
- You get the fuck outta the car!

939
01:15:51,845 --> 01:15:54,279
- Get outta the fucking car!
- It's my fucking car!

940
01:15:54,380 --> 01:15:56,746
- It's my fucking gun!
- Fuck, it's my gun now!

941
01:15:56,850 --> 01:15:59,045
Gimme my fucking gun!

942
01:16:06,214 --> 01:16:08,011
Fuck!

943
01:16:09,751 --> 01:16:13,687
Hands in plain sight!
Step out of the vehicle!

944
01:16:16,557 --> 01:16:20,584
Hands in plain sight!
Step out of the vehicle!

945
01:16:23,865 --> 01:16:26,425
Slowly step out
of the vehicle.

946
01:16:26,534 --> 01:16:30,231
- Get out of my car.
- You so brave, you get outta the car, man.

947
01:16:33,307 --> 01:16:37,107
Turn off the engine.
Throw the keys out the window.

948
01:16:49,757 --> 01:16:53,158
You fucking want me?
Here I am, you pig fuck!

949
01:16:53,261 --> 01:16:54,728
Lie face down on the ground.

950
01:16:54,829 --> 01:16:57,297
- Spread your arms and legs.
- No, you lie face down!

951
01:16:57,398 --> 01:16:59,593
Don't come any closer!
Down on your knees!

952
01:16:59,700 --> 01:17:02,100
Fuck you! What are you gonna do?
Pull the fucking trigger!

953
01:17:02,203 --> 01:17:03,170
On your knees now!

954
01:17:03,271 --> 01:17:05,967
You get on your knees
and suck my fucking dick!

955
01:17:06,073 --> 01:17:08,871
Do I look like
I'm fucking joking with you?

956
01:17:08,976 --> 01:17:10,534
That's what you look like,
a fucking joke to me.

957
01:17:10,645 --> 01:17:12,840
- This man is making threatening gestures.
- Threatening gestures?

958
01:17:12,947 --> 01:17:15,279
You wanna see a threatening gesture?
I got a threatening gesture.

959
01:17:15,383 --> 01:17:19,080
- I know this man! I know this man!
- Get back.

960
01:17:19,187 --> 01:17:21,712
- Give me some space. I know this guy.
- Get outta the way.

961
01:17:21,823 --> 01:17:22,949
Step away.

962
01:17:23,057 --> 01:17:25,048
Give me some goddamn room.
I know this guy.

963
01:17:26,928 --> 01:17:29,488
- Man, don't walk up on me!
- See what's happening here?

964
01:17:29,597 --> 01:17:31,792
Do you wanna die here, huh?
Is that what you want?

965
01:17:31,899 --> 01:17:33,833
'Cause these guys
really wanna shoot you.

966
01:17:33,935 --> 01:17:36,529
And the way you're acting,
they'll be completely fucking justified.

967
01:17:36,637 --> 01:17:37,797
Fuck you!

968
01:17:37,905 --> 01:17:41,068
Fuck me? I'm not the one who's fucked here.
You're the one.

969
01:17:41,175 --> 01:17:43,405
'Cause you're the one whose head's
gonna be blown off

970
01:17:43,511 --> 01:17:44,876
- and onto that man's patio.
- Officer Hanson, step away.

971
01:17:45,947 --> 01:17:49,212
He's a friend of mine, okay?
He's a fucking friend! This man is not armed!

972
01:17:49,317 --> 01:17:52,218
He's not gonna shoot you, me,
or anybody else, all right?

973
01:17:52,320 --> 01:17:54,413
So give me two goddamn seconds.
Can you do that?

974
01:17:54,522 --> 01:17:57,787
Lower your firearm.
Lower your firearm!

975
01:18:02,930 --> 01:18:06,195
You startin' to understand
the situation?

976
01:18:06,300 --> 01:18:09,030
What do you want from me?

977
01:18:09,136 --> 01:18:13,664
Unless you think your wife is better off with
a husband who has a bloody stump for a head,

978
01:18:13,774 --> 01:18:15,674
I want you to sit on that curb,
put your hands on your head

979
01:18:15,776 --> 01:18:18,006
and do nothing until I speak
with these officers.

980
01:18:18,112 --> 01:18:21,081
I'm not sittin' on no curb, I'm not puttin'
my hands on my head for nobody.

981
01:18:21,182 --> 01:18:25,209
Then stand where you are and keep your
hands in sight. Can you do that, huh?

982
01:18:28,289 --> 01:18:30,416
Yeah, I can do that.

983
01:18:30,525 --> 01:18:32,789
Good.

984
01:18:32,894 --> 01:18:36,694
I told this man to stay where he is
and keep his hands in plain sight.

985
01:18:36,797 --> 01:18:41,564
This man better be related to you by blood
because this is fucking nuts.

986
01:18:41,669 --> 01:18:43,762
I need this favor.

987
01:18:43,871 --> 01:18:47,898
You can check the guy's name, his license.
He's got no priors, no warrants.

988
01:18:48,009 --> 01:18:50,569
I need to let him go
with a warning.

989
01:18:50,678 --> 01:18:55,615
- What kind of fucking warning?
- A harsh warning.

990
01:18:58,185 --> 01:19:00,050
Thank you.

991
01:19:02,857 --> 01:19:06,918
You've been warned. Do you understand me?
Do you understand me!

992
01:19:07,028 --> 01:19:10,293
You want something from me?
'Cause I'm right here.

993
01:19:10,398 --> 01:19:14,459
- I'm trying to help you.
- I didn't ask for your help, did I?

994
01:19:16,604 --> 01:19:18,799
Go home.

995
01:19:22,443 --> 01:19:24,775
Yeah, that I can do.

996
01:20:43,290 --> 01:20:45,190
Look at me.

997
01:20:46,661 --> 01:20:49,323
You embarrass me.

998
01:20:49,430 --> 01:20:51,523
You embarrass yourself.

999
01:21:34,175 --> 01:21:35,665
Daddy's home!

1000
01:21:55,596 --> 01:21:57,621
- What's up?
- Give me my money!

1001
01:21:57,732 --> 01:22:00,166
- What? What money?
- Daddy!

1002
01:22:00,267 --> 01:22:03,566
- To pay for my store. Give me my money!
- Honey, stay inside. Elizabeth!

1003
01:22:03,671 --> 01:22:04,968
Give me my money!

1004
01:22:06,640 --> 01:22:09,803
- I want my fucking money! Give me that truck!
- That's not my truck!

1005
01:22:09,910 --> 01:22:12,242
- Daddy?
- Elizabeth!

1006
01:22:12,346 --> 01:22:16,612
Hey, you know what?
Hey, I got $50. Here.

1007
01:22:16,717 --> 01:22:19,015
Fifty dollars?
You took everything!

1008
01:22:19,120 --> 01:22:22,920
- Mommy?
- I'm coming, I'm coming!

1009
01:22:23,023 --> 01:22:27,289
- He doesn't have it.
- Hasn't got what?

1010
01:22:27,394 --> 01:22:32,627
I have it. He doesn't
have the impenetrable cloak!

1011
01:22:32,733 --> 01:22:34,394
Lara, stay outta the street!

1012
01:23:01,996 --> 01:23:05,693
- It's okay, Daddy.
- What... What?

1013
01:23:05,800 --> 01:23:07,267
I'll protect you.

1014
01:23:34,528 --> 01:23:37,224
It's okay. Daddy's okay.

1015
01:23:37,331 --> 01:23:40,323
It's a really good cloak.

1016
01:24:47,476 --> 01:24:52,436
I sent her out for groceries,
and that was two hours ago, Carol.

1017
01:24:52,548 --> 01:24:54,482
Well, you are one to talk.

1018
01:24:54,583 --> 01:24:58,451
You go through, like,
six housekeepers a year?

1019
01:24:58,554 --> 01:25:01,887
I'm not snapping at you!
I am angry.

1020
01:25:03,158 --> 01:25:05,217
Yes! At them! Yes!

1021
01:25:05,327 --> 01:25:09,661
At them, the police,
at Rick, at Maria,

1022
01:25:09,765 --> 01:25:13,462
at the dry cleaners
who destroyed another blouse today,

1023
01:25:13,569 --> 01:25:17,266
at the gardener who keeps
over-watering the lawn.

1024
01:25:17,373 --> 01:25:18,340
I...

1025
01:25:20,042 --> 01:25:22,567
I just thought that...

1026
01:25:22,678 --> 01:25:26,273
Carol, I just thought that
I would wake up today

1027
01:25:26,382 --> 01:25:29,351
and I would feel better,
you know?

1028
01:25:29,451 --> 01:25:33,444
But I was still mad.
And I realized...

1029
01:25:33,555 --> 01:25:37,457
I realized that it had nothing to do
with my car being stolen.

1030
01:25:39,495 --> 01:25:43,261
I wake up like this
every morning!

1031
01:25:43,365 --> 01:25:47,324
I am angry all the time,
and I don't know why.

1032
01:25:47,436 --> 01:25:50,769
Carol, I don't know why!
And I...

1033
01:25:52,441 --> 01:25:55,569
Yeah, yeah, call me back.

1034
01:25:55,677 --> 01:25:57,542
Bye.

1035
01:27:48,657 --> 01:27:50,522
Really appreciate this.

1036
01:27:50,626 --> 01:27:52,890
No problem.

1037
01:28:40,241 --> 01:28:42,106
So how long you been
out there tonight? It's cold.

1038
01:28:42,209 --> 01:28:44,404
Hour maybe.

1039
01:28:44,512 --> 01:28:46,207
Big surprise, huh?

1040
01:28:46,313 --> 01:28:49,578
Yeah, this ain't exactly
"pick up a brother" territory.

1041
01:28:49,683 --> 01:28:51,446
True.

1042
01:28:51,552 --> 01:28:53,577
So where you headed?

1043
01:28:53,687 --> 01:28:55,814
Anywhere the other side
of the hill.

1044
01:29:10,441 --> 01:29:11,999
That's some good music.

1045
01:29:14,646 --> 01:29:17,046
No, really. I'm startin'
to understand it.

1046
01:29:18,016 --> 01:29:21,213
Wrote me a country song
myself just yesterday.

1047
01:29:21,320 --> 01:29:23,618
I'll bet you did.

1048
01:29:41,581 --> 01:29:43,947
So what was goin' on
in the Valley tonight?

1049
01:29:44,050 --> 01:29:45,711
Ice-skatin'

1050
01:29:46,820 --> 01:29:47,980
Ice-skatin'

1051
01:29:48,088 --> 01:29:50,648
Love the ice-skatin'

1052
01:29:50,757 --> 01:29:54,386
When I was a kid, I always
wanted to be a goalie.

1053
01:29:54,494 --> 01:29:56,086
Come on!

1054
01:29:56,196 --> 01:29:59,461
What, you... you think
that's funny or somethin'

1055
01:29:59,566 --> 01:30:01,534
I think you're having fun.

1056
01:30:01,835 --> 01:30:03,826
Yeah. Whatever.

1057
01:30:13,580 --> 01:30:14,672
Something else funny?

1058
01:30:14,781 --> 01:30:17,011
Oh, yeah.

1059
01:30:19,319 --> 01:30:21,253
Yeah? What's that?

1060
01:30:21,354 --> 01:30:22,981
People, man. People.

1061
01:30:24,157 --> 01:30:26,125
People like me.

1062
01:30:26,226 --> 01:30:29,593
No, no, no.
I'm not laughin' at you, man.

1063
01:30:30,697 --> 01:30:32,255
Yeah, I can see that.

1064
01:30:32,365 --> 01:30:36,028
- Why don't you laugh outside?
- Why are you gettin' all bent outta shape?

1065
01:30:36,136 --> 01:30:38,798
I'm not gettin' bent, man.
Just pulling over.

1066
01:30:41,407 --> 01:30:45,503
Come on, man, keep drivin'
I said I'm not laughing at you.

1067
01:30:45,612 --> 01:30:47,978
And I'm not telling you
to get the fuck out of my car.

1068
01:30:48,081 --> 01:30:50,709
Why you bein' a fucking jerk?
Just drive the car.

1069
01:30:50,817 --> 01:30:52,682
I've got a better idea.
Get out now.

1070
01:30:52,786 --> 01:30:54,413
Fine. You want me
to show you? I'll show you.

1071
01:30:54,521 --> 01:30:57,149
Get your hands out of your pocket.
Put your hands where I can see 'em.

1072
01:30:57,257 --> 01:30:59,282
- Who the fuck you think you're talkin' to?
- Put your hands where I can see!

1073
01:30:59,392 --> 01:31:02,190
You wanna see what's in my hands?
I'll show you what's in my fuckin' hands!

1074
01:31:27,587 --> 01:31:29,179
Oh, God.

1075
01:31:38,464 --> 01:31:39,988
Oh, God.

1076
01:32:15,668 --> 01:32:20,071
Thank you, Brother Merle.
That was Merle Haggard on KYHA.

1077
01:32:20,173 --> 01:32:22,266
The scene of country music
here in L.A.

1078
01:32:22,375 --> 01:32:24,570
It's a cold night,
and it's getting colder.

1079
01:32:24,677 --> 01:32:28,670
We're giving out tickets to the rodeo coming
to the Fairplex in Pomona.

1080
01:32:31,818 --> 01:32:36,050
- Hey, you okay?
- I'm freezin'

1081
01:32:36,156 --> 01:32:39,125
Shit. I heard
it might snow.

1082
01:32:39,226 --> 01:32:41,558
- Get outta here.
- That's what I heard.

1083
01:32:41,661 --> 01:32:44,926
- You got a smoke?
- Nah. I quit.

1084
01:32:45,031 --> 01:32:47,192
Yeah, me too.

1085
01:32:47,300 --> 01:32:49,860
- What do you got?
- Dead kid.

1086
01:32:52,672 --> 01:32:55,163
Hey, Bob.

1087
01:34:22,195 --> 01:34:25,187
Choi Jin Gui! Choi Jin Gui!

1088
01:34:25,298 --> 01:34:28,267
- Choi Jin Gui! Choi Jin Gui!
- Do you speak English?

1089
01:34:28,368 --> 01:34:32,361
I am speaking English, you stupid cow!
My husband name Choi Jin Gui!

1090
01:34:34,608 --> 01:34:36,132
- Jin Gui!
- Ma'am!

1091
01:34:36,242 --> 01:34:39,473
Kim Lee.

1092
01:34:45,385 --> 01:34:48,218
I thought you were dead.
I called every hospital.

1093
01:34:48,321 --> 01:34:51,910
It's okay. I'm okay.

1094
01:34:52,010 --> 01:34:53,910
Thank you for finding me.

1095
01:34:56,614 --> 01:35:00,778
- Will you do something for me?
- Anything.

1096
01:35:18,673 --> 01:35:22,006
Go to the locker.

1097
01:35:24,646 --> 01:35:26,580
No, next one.

1098
01:35:29,651 --> 01:35:32,415
In my wallet,
there's a check.

1099
01:35:32,520 --> 01:35:34,613
Bring it here.

1100
01:35:42,664 --> 01:35:45,895
Oh, I get it. When I said get me
a black Lincoln Navigator,

1101
01:35:46,001 --> 01:35:49,368
you thought I said get me
a white piece of shit panel van.

1102
01:35:49,471 --> 01:35:54,499
- Fine, fine. Just give me whatever for it.
- You should see this.

1103
01:36:10,659 --> 01:36:12,559
I'll take the van.

1104
01:36:12,661 --> 01:36:14,891
They're chained to the van.

1105
01:36:14,996 --> 01:36:16,657
So I'll take them too.

1106
01:36:18,066 --> 01:36:20,091
You wanna buy
these Chinamen?

1107
01:36:20,201 --> 01:36:22,260
Don't be ignorant.
They're Thai or Cambodian.

1108
01:36:22,370 --> 01:36:24,531
Entirely different kind of chinks.

1109
01:36:24,639 --> 01:36:27,767
- What the hell are you gonna do with 'em?
- Sell 'em. What you think?

1110
01:36:27,876 --> 01:36:32,210
I'll give you 500 apiece,
and you can keep the van.

1111
01:36:50,332 --> 01:36:53,267
Oh, no!

1112
01:36:57,038 --> 01:36:59,302
No! No!

1113
01:37:15,523 --> 01:37:17,388
This is Dorri.

1114
01:37:29,871 --> 01:37:34,069
My baby. My poor baby!

1115
01:37:36,344 --> 01:37:38,812
Mom.

1116
01:37:38,913 --> 01:37:43,577
I promise you... I promise I'm gonna
find out who did this, Mom.

1117
01:37:45,487 --> 01:37:48,251
Oh, I already know.

1118
01:37:50,225 --> 01:37:51,954
You did.

1119
01:37:54,295 --> 01:37:58,925
I asked you to find your brother,
but you were busy.

1120
01:37:59,033 --> 01:38:02,833
We weren't much good
to you anymore, were we?

1121
01:38:07,275 --> 01:38:10,301
You got things to do.
You go ahead. I'll sign the papers.

1122
01:38:10,412 --> 01:38:12,243
I wanna stay.

1123
01:38:12,347 --> 01:38:16,010
I just wanna wait
with my baby.

1124
01:38:25,860 --> 01:38:27,657
He came home.

1125
01:38:27,762 --> 01:38:30,663
Did you know that?

1126
01:38:30,765 --> 01:38:33,598
My little boy.

1127
01:38:33,701 --> 01:38:35,498
When I was sleepin',

1128
01:38:35,603 --> 01:38:38,663
he brought me groceries.

1129
01:38:38,773 --> 01:38:40,764
It's the last thing he did.

1130
01:39:20,114 --> 01:39:22,105
What happened?

1131
01:39:28,623 --> 01:39:30,488
What did you do?

1132
01:39:31,593 --> 01:39:34,153
What did you do?

1133
01:39:36,331 --> 01:39:38,231
I shoot a little girl.

1134
01:39:38,333 --> 01:39:40,563
What?

1135
01:39:40,668 --> 01:39:43,501
No, she's okay. She's...

1136
01:39:45,139 --> 01:39:47,266
She's... Here.

1137
01:39:47,375 --> 01:39:52,608
The gun shoot her,
but she's okay, Dorri.

1138
01:39:52,714 --> 01:39:55,706
Nothing happened.

1139
01:39:57,418 --> 01:39:58,578
She's my...

1140
01:40:00,288 --> 01:40:02,085
What are you
talking about, Daddy?

1141
01:40:05,894 --> 01:40:07,691
My angel.

1142
01:40:09,831 --> 01:40:11,765
My angel!

1143
01:40:13,568 --> 01:40:16,196
She came to protect me.

1144
01:40:17,505 --> 01:40:19,905
To protect us!

1145
01:40:21,643 --> 01:40:23,440
You understand?

1146
01:40:27,782 --> 01:40:29,807
Take this. Please.

1147
01:40:31,386 --> 01:40:33,286
Take it.

1148
01:40:37,659 --> 01:40:40,219
Hey! Hey!

1149
01:40:40,328 --> 01:40:43,889
Everything is okay, Dorri.

1150
01:40:43,998 --> 01:40:45,727
It's okay.

1151
01:40:50,772 --> 01:40:52,399
Okay, Daddy.

1152
01:40:52,507 --> 01:40:54,099
Okay.

1153
01:41:17,265 --> 01:41:18,562
Jean?

1154
01:41:18,666 --> 01:41:20,691
- Rick?
- Yeah. What's wrong.

1155
01:41:20,802 --> 01:41:23,498
I fell down the stairs.

1156
01:41:23,605 --> 01:41:26,938
- Are you all right?
- I tried calling you.

1157
01:41:27,041 --> 01:41:30,238
I couldn't get through
to anyone. Not...

1158
01:41:30,345 --> 01:41:33,781
Not Kath, not Marge, not Julie.

1159
01:41:33,881 --> 01:41:36,611
I'm getting in the elevator. I'll be in my car.
I'll be home in 20 minutes.

1160
01:41:36,718 --> 01:41:39,710
It's okay. Maria drove me to emergency.
It's just a bad sprain.

1161
01:41:39,821 --> 01:41:42,221
Carol was the only one
that was home and

1162
01:41:42,323 --> 01:41:45,986
she said she couldn't come get me
because she was getting a massage.

1163
01:41:46,094 --> 01:41:48,494
That's because she's a bitch.

1164
01:41:48,596 --> 01:41:52,532
She's been my friend for ten years.

1165
01:41:52,634 --> 01:41:54,499
All right, honey.
Feel better.

1166
01:41:54,602 --> 01:41:56,900
I'll be there soon.

1167
01:41:59,107 --> 01:42:01,007
I love you.

1168
01:42:01,109 --> 01:42:03,339
I love you too.

1169
01:42:36,250 --> 01:42:38,343
Miss Jean.

1170
01:42:40,388 --> 01:42:43,016
Would you like to sit up?

1171
01:42:48,696 --> 01:42:51,893
Here. Good!

1172
01:43:00,508 --> 01:43:02,703
Do you wanna hear
something funny?

1173
01:43:02,810 --> 01:43:04,744
What, Mrs. Jean?

1174
01:43:06,580 --> 01:43:09,378
You're the best friend
I've got.

1175
01:46:22,910 --> 01:46:24,275
Hi.

1176
01:46:24,978 --> 01:46:26,468
Hi.

1177
01:46:32,286 --> 01:46:34,015
I love you.

1178
01:48:04,211 --> 01:48:06,076
All right.

1179
01:48:06,179 --> 01:48:09,546
Everybody out, man.
You're free to go.

1180
01:48:12,352 --> 01:48:14,718
All right, come on.

1181
01:48:14,821 --> 01:48:18,279
Come on now! This is America.
Time is money. Chop, chop!

1182
01:48:18,392 --> 01:48:19,859
Come on, y'all.

1183
01:48:23,163 --> 01:48:24,926
Come on.

1184
01:48:49,068 --> 01:48:51,161
That's $40.

1185
01:48:51,270 --> 01:48:54,205
Buy everybody chop suey.
You understand?

1186
01:48:55,608 --> 01:48:58,133
Dopey fucking Chinaman.

1187
01:49:30,513 --> 01:49:34,882
Oh, my God!
What the hell is wrong with you?

1188
01:49:34,984 --> 01:49:38,545
Uh-uh! Don't talk to me
unless you speak American!

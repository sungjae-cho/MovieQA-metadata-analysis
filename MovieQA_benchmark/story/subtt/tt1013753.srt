00:02:32,552 --> 00:02:38,320
This is Harvey Milk speaking
on Friday, November 18th.

2
00:02:39,692 --> 00:02:44,152
This is only to be played in the
event of my death by assassination.

3
00:02:47,901 --> 00:02:50,335
During one of
my early campaigns,

4
00:02:50,403 --> 00:02:56,308
I began to open speeches with a line
and it became kind of a signature.

5
00:02:56,976 --> 00:03:00,007
<i>My name is Harvey Milk and
I want to recruit you.</i>

6
00:03:00,213 --> 00:03:01,373
(ALL CHEERING)

7
00:03:01,915 --> 00:03:06,443
If I was speaking to a
slightly hostile audience

8
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:10,580
or a mostly straight one, I might
break the tension with a joke.

9
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:13,490
I know. I know I'm
not what you expected,

10
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,152
but I left my
high heels at home.

11
00:03:15,228 --> 00:03:16,490
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

12
00:03:18,665 --> 00:03:24,069
I fully realize that a person
who stands for what I stand for,

13
00:03:24,137 --> 00:03:25,604
an activist,
a gay activist,

14
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:31,468
<i>makes himself the target
for someone who is insecure,</i>

15
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:34,672
<i>terrified, afraid
and disturbed themselves.</i>

16
00:03:34,747 --> 00:03:39,275
It's a very real possibility you
see, because in San Francisco,

17
00:03:39,352 --> 00:03:43,152
we have broken a dam of major
prejudice in this country.

18
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:46,249
<i>MAN 1 ON RADIO: room 200.
I'm in the mayor's office.</i>

19
00:03:46,326 --> 00:03:50,126
<i>MAN 2 ON RADIO: We are trying
to ascertain what is happening.</i>

20
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:53,057
As President of the
Board of Supervisors,

21
00:03:53,132 --> 00:03:55,566
it's my duty to
make this announcement.

22
00:03:56,502 --> 00:04:00,336
Both Mayor Moscone and
Supervisor Harvey Milk

23
00:04:01,374 --> 00:04:03,604
have been shot and killed.

24
00:04:03,676 --> 00:04:05,371
(PEOPLE EXCLAIMING)

25
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,707
I wish I had time to explain
all the things that I did.

26
00:04:11,784 --> 00:04:14,719
Almost everything was done
with an eye on the gay movement.

27
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:25,754
HARVEY: Hey. Hey.

28
00:04:27,734 --> 00:04:29,099
I'm Harvey.

29
00:04:29,535 --> 00:04:30,763
Okay, Harvey.

30
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:32,435
(CHUCKLES)

31
00:04:32,505 --> 00:04:33,870
Today's my birthday.

32
00:04:34,841 --> 00:04:38,538
No, hey, actually it is
my birthday. At midnight.

33
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:39,669
Really?

34
00:04:40,513 --> 00:04:43,209
And, believe it or not,
I don't have any plans.

35
00:04:44,684 --> 00:04:47,152
Some people took
me out after work.

36
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:52,817
Hmm. And that would be at,
let me guess, Ma Bell or AT&T.

37
00:04:53,693 --> 00:04:55,558
The Great American
Insurance Company.

38
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:56,720
Oh.

39
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:59,822
I'm part of that corporate
establishment that,

40
00:04:59,899 --> 00:05:02,834
let me guess, you think is the
cause of all the evil in the world,

41
00:05:02,902 --> 00:05:04,460
from Vietnam
to diaper rash.

42
00:05:04,537 --> 00:05:06,095
You left out bad breath.

43
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:10,603
Just kidding.

44
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:16,806
You're not gonna let me spend my
birthday all by myself, are you?

45
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:20,884
Listen, Harvey,

46
00:05:22,188 --> 00:05:24,179
you're pretty cute,

47
00:05:24,257 --> 00:05:26,225
but I don't
date guys over 40.

48
00:05:28,027 --> 00:05:30,359
Well, then, this
is my lucky night.

49
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,195
Why is that?

50
00:05:32,265 --> 00:05:33,960
I'm still 39.

51
00:05:34,801 --> 00:05:36,496
It's only 11:15.

52
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:48,677
Come on.

55
00:05:54,754 --> 00:05:56,654
I'm Scott.

56
00:05:56,723 --> 00:05:59,658
Very nice to meet you,
Mr. Harvey, insurance man.

<i>(MUSIC PLAYING)</i>

58
00:06:38,297 --> 00:06:40,458
HARVEY: Where are you from?

59
00:06:40,533 --> 00:06:42,364
SCOTT: Jackson, Mississippi.

60
00:06:44,437 --> 00:06:47,304
HARVEY: This isn't Jackson. You can't
respond to just every strange man

61
00:06:47,373 --> 00:06:49,000
that picks you up
on a subway platform.

62
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:50,099
It's too dangerous.

63
00:06:50,176 --> 00:06:51,507
Hmm, now you tell me.

64
00:06:52,712 --> 00:06:54,441
The New York Police
are the toughest.

65
00:06:54,514 --> 00:06:56,243
They're arrogant
and they're everywhere.

66
00:06:56,315 --> 00:06:57,782
I'll show you all
the cruising spots,

67
00:06:57,850 --> 00:06:59,784
but you have to be very
careful, little Scotty-san.

68
00:06:59,852 --> 00:07:02,218
(CHUCKLES) Are you on
some uppers or something?

69
00:07:02,822 --> 00:07:05,620
No. This is
just plain me.

70
00:07:06,859 --> 00:07:08,588
And you're scared
of the cops?

71
00:07:09,395 --> 00:07:11,920
I'm just discreet.
I know a lot of people.

72
00:07:11,998 --> 00:07:13,898
If they see me,
I could lose my job.

73
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:16,429
Oh, you're one of those.

74
00:07:18,371 --> 00:07:22,467
Well, I think you need to find
a new scene. Some new friends.

75
00:07:25,478 --> 00:07:27,639
I need a change.
- I know.

76
00:07:28,981 --> 00:07:30,608
Yeah, you're 40 now.

77
00:07:30,683 --> 00:07:31,672
Oh.

78
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:39,285
Forty years old and I haven't
done a thing I'm proud of.

79
00:07:39,358 --> 00:07:43,351
You keep eating this cake and you're
going to be fat by the time you're 50.

80
00:07:43,429 --> 00:07:45,363
That's if I ever
get to 50. Oh!

81
00:07:46,032 --> 00:07:48,193
Happy birthday, old man.

82
00:07:52,672 --> 00:07:54,731
Why don't we
run away together?

83

<i>To drop out,
to fall in love.</i>

87
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:26,669
But by 1972, the Haight was boarded up.
Drug filled, crime filled.

00:09:23,996 --> 00:09:26,624
I cashed my last unemployment
check yesterday.

96

HARVEY: Well, I hope you
did something useful with it.

97

an ounce of pot.

move for a second.

I can wait tables.

I don't want you to go anywhere.

101
00:09:43,616 --> 00:09:46,050
I want you
right here with me.

102
00:09:47,053 --> 00:09:49,248
I was thinking
about a little shop.

103
00:09:49,322 --> 00:09:50,721
What kind of shop?

104
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:52,382
Just a little shop
with a little overhead.

105
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:53,482
Not too much work.

106
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:56,221
Just like Morris and Minnie
Milk of Woodmere, New York.

107
00:09:56,896 --> 00:09:59,262
Did you see the little
place downstairs for rent?

108
00:09:59,332 --> 00:10:00,731
Yeah.

109
00:10:01,534 --> 00:10:03,092
What do you
think about that?

110
00:10:03,869 --> 00:10:05,268
I think it sounds great.

111
00:10:05,338 --> 00:10:07,568
A little bit
up on the left.

112
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:15,175
Oh, it looks great.
Looks great.

113
00:10:15,247 --> 00:10:16,578
Yeah.

- Welcome to Castro Camera.

Scott.

118
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:28,427
HARVEY: Yeah. Like,
you know, I would like

119
00:10:28,494 --> 00:10:32,396
to join the, what's it called,
The Eureka Valley Merchants Association.

120
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:33,659
I'm not an interloper.

121
00:10:33,733 --> 00:10:36,497
A Jew, perhaps, but I
hope you'll forgive that.

122
00:10:36,569 --> 00:10:38,059
If you open
those doors,

123
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:41,106
the Merchants Association will
have the police pull your license.

124
00:10:41,173 --> 00:10:42,640
Under what law?

125
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:44,403
Excuse me?

126
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:47,537
There's man's law and there's
God's law in this neighborhood

127
00:10:47,613 --> 00:10:48,739
and in this city.

128
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:50,338
SCOTT:
You know, we pay taxes.

129
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:53,783
The San Francisco police force
is happy to enforce either.

130
00:10:53,853 --> 00:10:54,911
Have a good day.

131
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:58,150
HARVEY: Yeah, thank you for the
warm welcome to the neighborhood!

132

133
00:11:02,862 --> 00:11:03,954
Well.

134
00:11:05,531 --> 00:11:06,691
Hey.

135
00:11:10,269 --> 00:11:12,669
HARVEY: Okay.
Customers, come on in.

136
00:11:35,094 --> 00:11:37,858
HARVEY: We'll form our
own business association.

137
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:40,125
We'll start with
the gay businesses.

138
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:44,101
We'll get the addresses of every customer
that comes in the store for a roll of film

139
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:47,537
and we'll ask them what they
want, what they need changed.

140
00:11:47,606 --> 00:11:50,769
We'll get some money rolling in here.
Revitalize the neighborhood.

141
00:11:50,843 --> 00:11:52,242
Can I come in now?

142
00:11:53,412 --> 00:11:55,004
One more minute.

143
00:11:57,316 --> 00:11:59,113
And I can go to
the neighborhood banks.

144
00:11:59,185 --> 00:12:01,085
They must have
some gay customers.

145
00:12:01,153 --> 00:12:04,816
Look, Harvey, what's with all
this political activist crap?

146
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:07,450
I mean, I thought you
were a goddamn Republican.

147
00:12:07,526 --> 00:12:09,460
I'm a businessman, Scott.

148
00:12:09,528 --> 00:12:12,827
And businesses should be
good to their customers.

149
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:15,697
Even if their
customers are gay.

150
00:12:15,768 --> 00:12:17,759
For God's sake,
it's San Francisco!

151
00:12:17,837 --> 00:12:20,670
SCOTT: Yeah. Well, it's just like
any other city in the country.

152
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,264
They hate us.
Real surprise.

153
00:12:22,341 --> 00:12:25,174
We should have at least one
block in one city, right?

154
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:28,975
We start there and then we'll
take over the neighborhood.

155
00:12:29,048 --> 00:12:30,379
Maybe.

156
00:12:31,684 --> 00:12:32,912
I'm coming in.

157
00:12:32,985 --> 00:12:35,180
HARVEY: Okay,
you can come in now.

158
00:12:38,124 --> 00:12:40,524
Finally.
This better be good.

159
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,591
Oh!

160
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:44,828

I had to do it!

163
00:12:51,137 --> 00:12:53,264

- Harvey Milk!

HARVEY: Sanctuary!

165
00:12:54,874 --> 00:12:57,104
And Castro became
destination number one.

166
00:12:58,844 --> 00:13:02,644
Hundreds of gay men were coming
every week from all over the world.

167
00:13:03,349 --> 00:13:05,943
<i>It was our area.
Our own neighborhood.</i>

168
00:13:16,428 --> 00:13:19,659
<i>The police hated us.
And we hated them right back.</i>

169
00:13:20,332 --> 00:13:23,028
<i>They would come in and
attack us and beat us just for fun.</i>

170
00:13:23,102 --> 00:13:24,501
<i>But that wouldn't stop us.</i>

171
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:28,734
<i>I made a list of shops that were
friendly to us and shops that weren't.</i>

172
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:31,038

worked with us thrived.</i>

173

back on every issue from now on.

HARVEY: What are you
working on, Dan?

1345
01:22:59,107 --> 01:23:00,574
If you have something
to discuss, Harvey,

1346
01:23:00,642 --> 01:23:03,873
you can have your aide make
an appointment with my aide.

1347
01:23:03,945 --> 01:23:06,971
Dan, I know you're upset
about the psychiatric center.

have coming up?

1349

1352
01:23:17,559 --> 01:23:20,050
We prefer the term gay, Dan.

1353
01:23:20,128 --> 01:23:24,087
Just as I'm sure you prefer the
term Irish-American instead of mick.

1354
01:23:24,699 --> 01:23:28,294
Harvey, a society can't
exist without the family.

1355
01:23:28,370 --> 01:23:30,065
We're not against that.
- You're not?

1357
01:23:31,973 --> 01:23:32,962
No.

we keep trying.

introduce an initiative
for supervisor pay raises.

1365
01:23:53,661 --> 01:23:55,891
Dan, we both have elections
coming up. We can't do that.

1366
01:23:55,964 --> 01:23:58,091
No, you asked for something.

1367
01:23:58,166 --> 01:24:02,432
Introduce pay raises, 'cause I can't
take care of my family on our salaries.

1368

- Okay.

I've learned a lot from watching you.
- I doubt that.

No, I have. I've realized
you just gotta get out there.

What?
- I...

1433
01:28:07,715 --> 01:28:12,152
Dan, I have had four
relationships in my life.

1434
01:28:12,220 --> 01:28:15,417
And three of them have tried to
commit suicide. And that's my fault,

1435
01:28:15,490 --> 01:28:18,891
because I kept them hidden and quiet,
because I was closeted and weak.

1436
01:28:18,960 --> 01:28:21,520
You see what I'm saying?
- Yes.

1437
01:28:21,596 --> 01:28:23,587
You do?
- Mmm-hmm.

1438
01:28:23,665 --> 01:28:28,432
This is not just jobs or issues,
this is our lives we're fighting for.

Cleve's getting some people
together in the Castro.

1821
01:57:55,441 --> 01:57:59,999
Last week I got a phone call
from Altoona, Pennsylvania.

1822
01:58:01,109 --> 01:58:06,941
The voice was very young,
and the person said, "Thanks."

1823
01:58:08,278 --> 01:58:13,007
<i>You've got to elect gay people
so that the young child</i>

1824
01:58:13,613 --> 01:58:16,739
<i>and the thousands upon
thousands just like him</i>

1825
01:58:17,647 --> 01:58:20,307
<i>will have hope
for a better life.</i>

1826
01:58:21,449 --> 01:58:23,847
<i>Hope for a better tomorrow.</i>

1827
01:58:41,321 --> 01:58:42,787
<i>I ask this,</i>

1828
01:58:44,322 --> 01:58:47,255
<i>that if there be
an assassination,</i>

1829
01:58:48,891 --> 01:58:55,086
<i>I would want five, ten,
a hundred, a thousand to rise.</i>

1830
01:58:59,827 --> 01:59:04,158
<i>If a bullet should enter my brain,
let it destroy every closet door.</i>

1831
01:59:05,696 --> 01:59:12,893
<i>I ask for the movement to continue
because it's not about personal gain,</i>

1832
01:59:12,964 --> 01:59:16,125
<i>and it's not about ego
and it's not about power.</i>

1833
01:59:16,899 --> 01:59:19,423
<i>It's about the
"us's" out there.</i>

1834
01:59:20,801 --> 01:59:24,564
<i>Not just the gays but
the blacks and the Asians</i>

1835
01:59:24,635 --> 01:59:26,534
<i>and the seniors
and the disabled.</i>

1836
01:59:26,602 --> 01:59:27,829
<i>The "us's."</i>

1837
01:59:31,503 --> 01:59:34,868
<i>Without hope,
the "us's" give up.</i>

1838
01:59:37,073 --> 01:59:41,166
<i>And I know you can't
live on hope alone.</i>

1839
01:59:41,240 --> 01:59:45,936
<i>But without hope,
life is not worth living.</i>

1840
01:59:48,309 --> 01:59:49,707
<i>So you,</i>

1841
01:59:50,676 --> 01:59:52,233
<i>and you,</i>

1842
01:59:52,744 --> 01:59:54,108
<i>and you,</i>

1843
01:59:54,478 --> 01:59:56,501
you got to give them hope.

1844
01:59:58,345 --> 02:00:00,834
You got to give them hope.

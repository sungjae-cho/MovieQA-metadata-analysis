1
00:01:14,449 --> 00:01:16,326
<i>The future.</i>

2
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:19,835
<i>A dark, desolate world.</i>

3
00:01:25,711 --> 00:01:31,013
<i>A world of war, suffering, loss...</i>

4
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:33,268
<i>on both sides.</i>

5
00:01:34,344 --> 00:01:38,815
<i>Mutants and the humans
who dared to help them.</i>

6
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:46,448
<i>Fighting an enemy we cannot defeat.</i>

7
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:16,224
<i>Are we destined down this path?</i>

8
00:02:16,595 --> 00:02:21,772
<i>Destined to destroy ourselves
like so many species before us?</i>

9
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:29,150
<i>Or can we evolve
fast enough to change ourselves?</i>

10
00:02:29,775 --> 00:02:31,152
<i>Change our fate?</i>

11
00:02:37,366 --> 00:02:40,745
<i>Is the future truly set?</i>

12
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:11,255
They're here!

13
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:17,966
Time's up.

14
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:19,096
Sentinels!

15
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:24,347
Sunspot!

16
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:30,395
Let's go.

17
00:05:15,482 --> 00:05:16,779
Run!

18
00:05:18,485 --> 00:05:19,486
Go!

19
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:01,963
Blink! No!

20
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:50,557
Too late, assholes.

21
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:11,703
Don't move, you mutant scum!

22
00:08:15,412 --> 00:08:16,584
No!

23
00:08:17,956 --> 00:08:20,209
Flat on the ground,
hands behind your head!

24
00:08:25,088 --> 00:08:27,716
<i>So few of us left.</i>

25
00:08:31,094 --> 00:08:32,141
<i>Professor?</i>

26
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:34,682
I've found them.

27
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:08,107
Professor!

28
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:11,368
- Bobby.
- Hey, Storm.

29
00:10:12,487 --> 00:10:13,534
Hey, kid.

30
00:10:14,531 --> 00:10:17,080
Professor, you made it.

31
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:31,765
Whenever the Sentinels attack,
Warpath spots them...

32
00:10:32,423 --> 00:10:36,144
then I send Bishop back to warn us
of the attack before it happens.

33
00:10:36,511 --> 00:10:38,809
Blink scouts the next site...

34
00:10:39,556 --> 00:10:41,900
and then we leave
before they ever know we were there.

35
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:44,686
Because... We never were.

36
00:10:44,853 --> 00:10:46,696
What do you mean you were never there?

37
00:10:46,855 --> 00:10:49,904
She projects Bishop back in time
a few days to warn the others...

38
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:51,693
of the coming attack.

39
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:53,988
So she sends Bishop back in time?

40
00:10:54,112 --> 00:10:56,786
No, just his consciousness,
into his younger self.

41
00:10:56,948 --> 00:10:58,200
His younger body.

42
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:00,164
Wow.

43
00:11:00,869 --> 00:11:03,964
This might just work, Charles.

44
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:06,253
What might work?

45
00:11:07,709 --> 00:11:12,055
The Sentinel program was originally
conceived by Doctor Bolivar Trask.

46
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:16,851
In the early '70s, he was one of the
world's leading weapons designers.

47
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:21,314
<i>But, covertly, he had begun
experimenting on mutants...</i>

48
00:11:21,472 --> 00:11:24,646
<i>using their gifts
to fuel his own research.</i>

49
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:26,186
This is extraordinary.

50
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:29,572
<i>There was one mutant who had discovered
what he was doing.</i>

51
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:34,744
A mutant with the ability
to transform herself into anyone.

52
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:36,658
Mystique.

53
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:39,624
<i>I knew her as Raven.</i>

54
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:43,169
We met when we were children,
grew up together.

55
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:45,835
She was like a sister to me.

56
00:11:46,164 --> 00:11:47,882
I tried to help her...

57
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:51,591
but only succeeded in driving her away.

58
00:11:52,295 --> 00:11:55,174
She hunted Trask across the world.

59
00:11:55,506 --> 00:12:00,137
And at the Paris Peace Accords in 1973,
after the Vietnam War...

60
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:02,347
<i>she found Trask...</i>

61
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:06,980
and killed him.

62
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:14,867
<i>It was the first time she killed.</i>

63
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:16,577
It wasn't her last.

64
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:20,491
But killing Trask did not have
the outcome she expected.

65
00:12:20,615 --> 00:12:24,665
It only persuaded the government
of the need for his program.

66
00:12:25,328 --> 00:12:27,046
They captured her that day...

67
00:12:27,205 --> 00:12:30,004
tortured her,
experimented on her.

68
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:35,384
<i>In her DNA, they discovered the secrets
to her powers of transformation.</i>

69
00:12:35,546 --> 00:12:37,594
<i>It gave them the key they needed...</i>

70
00:12:37,715 --> 00:12:41,720
<i>to create weapons that could adapt
to any mutant power.</i>

71
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:44,146
<i>And in less than 50 years...</i>

72
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:46,478
<i>the machines that have destroyed...</i>

73
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:49,569
<i>so many of our kind were created.</i>

74
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:54,195
But it all started that day in 1973...

75
00:12:54,691 --> 00:12:56,068
the day she first killed.

76
00:12:56,359 --> 00:12:58,282
The day she truly became...

77
00:12:58,403 --> 00:12:59,871
Mystique.

78
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:03,241
You want to go back there.

79
00:13:03,408 --> 00:13:06,708
If I can get to her,
stop the assassination...

80
00:13:06,828 --> 00:13:08,250
keep her out of their hands...

81
00:13:08,371 --> 00:13:11,841
then we can stop the Sentinels
from ever being born.

82
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:15,212
And end this war before it ever begins.

83
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:22,264
I can send someone back
a couple weeks.

84
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:24,182
Maybe a month.

85
00:13:24,262 --> 00:13:27,562
But you're talking about
going back decades.

86
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,519
You have the most powerful brain
in the world, Professor...

87
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:34,902
but the mind can only stretch so far
before it snaps.

88
00:13:35,398 --> 00:13:38,493
It would rip you apart. I'm sorry.

89
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:40,824
No one could survive that trip.

90
00:13:41,195 --> 00:13:44,244
What if someone's mind
has a way of snapping back?

91
00:13:45,742 --> 00:13:48,916
What if someone can heal
as fast <i>as</i> they're ripped apart?

92
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:15,113
Okay, spread out.

93
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:17,444
Take your positions.

94
00:14:31,454 --> 00:14:34,048
So I wake up in my younger body,
God knows where.

95
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:35,295
Then what?

96
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:38,462
You'll need to go to my house
and find me.

97
00:14:38,628 --> 00:14:41,222
Convince me of all of this.

98
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:43,049
Won't you be able to just read my mind?

99
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:46,352
I didn't have my powers in 1973.

100
00:14:46,677 --> 00:14:50,853
Logan, you're going to have to do for me
what I once did for you.

101
00:14:51,057 --> 00:14:53,810
Lead me, guide me.

102
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:56,441
I was a very different man then.

103
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:58,735
You'll have to be patient with me.

104
00:14:59,482 --> 00:15:01,985
Patience is my strongest suit.

105
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:04,370
- You'll need me <i>as</i> well.
- What?

106
00:15:04,487 --> 00:15:07,286
After Mystique left Charles,
she came with me...

107
00:15:07,365 --> 00:15:10,494
and I set her on a dangerous path.

108
00:15:10,827 --> 00:15:12,124
A darker path.

109
00:15:12,203 --> 00:15:14,877
It's going to take the two of us,
side by side...

110
00:15:14,956 --> 00:15:17,675
at a time when we couldn't
be further apart.

111
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:22,346
Great.

112
00:15:23,131 --> 00:15:24,849
So where do I find you?

113
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:26,676
Well, it's complicated.

114
00:15:30,012 --> 00:15:34,017
Basically, your body will go to sleep
while your mind travels back in time.

115
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:38,401
As long <i>as</i> you're back there,
past and present will continue to coexist.

116
00:15:38,855 --> 00:15:40,198
But once you wake up...

117
00:15:41,524 --> 00:15:44,243
whatever you've done
will take hold and become history.

118
00:15:44,527 --> 00:15:47,451
And for the rest of us,
it will be the only history that we know.

119
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:50,909
It will be like the last 50 years
never happened.

120
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:53,586
And this world, and this war...

121
00:15:53,744 --> 00:15:57,123
the only person who will
remember it is you.

122
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,001
All right, Logan...

123
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:03,304
I need you to clear your head
and to stay <i>as</i> calm as possible.

124
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:04,881
What? What do you mean?

125
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:07,342
If your mind gets rocky,
it will be harder for me to hold you...

126
00:16:07,425 --> 00:16:09,803
and you could start
to slip between past and future.

127
00:16:09,886 --> 00:16:11,888
What if I need to get a little rocky?

128
00:16:13,014 --> 00:16:14,311
Think peaceful thoughts?

129
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:17,314
Peaceful thoughts...
Do you have any good news?

130
00:16:17,477 --> 00:16:21,323
Well, you don't really age,
so you'll pretty much look the same.

131
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:24,400
You won't have much time in the past.

132
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:26,031
The Sentinels will find us.

133
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:27,453
They always do.

134
00:16:27,612 --> 00:16:29,239
And this time, we won't be able to run.

135
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:30,952
We'll have no escape.

136
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:34,289
This is our last chance.

137
00:16:34,744 --> 00:16:38,590
- You really think this will work?
- I have faith in him.

138
00:16:38,748 --> 00:16:40,625
It's not him I'm worried about, it's us.

139
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:42,252
We were young...

140
00:16:42,335 --> 00:16:43,928
we didn't know any better.

141
00:16:44,921 --> 00:16:47,424
We will now.

142
00:16:48,466 --> 00:16:49,809
See you all soon.

143
00:16:49,967 --> 00:16:51,935
This might sting a little.

144
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:29,658
Holy shit.

145
00:18:37,617 --> 00:18:39,335
It worked.

146
00:18:43,873 --> 00:18:45,125
What's going on?

147
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:47,335
- Gwen, get dressed.
- Who the hell are you?

148
00:18:47,418 --> 00:18:48,578
I don't know what's going on.

149
00:18:48,628 --> 00:18:51,348
You're supposed to be guarding
the boss's daughter, not screwing her.

150
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,257
Well, I didn't sleep with her.

151
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:55,055
- No?
- No.

152
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,479
I mean, yes, I slept with her many times.

153
00:18:58,554 --> 00:18:59,806
Jimmy!

154
00:18:59,889 --> 00:19:02,392
That wasn't me.
That was the old me.

155
00:19:02,475 --> 00:19:05,149
I just got here 20 seconds ago.

156
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:07,321
Really? Then what happened to your clothes?

157
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:08,943
<i>My...</i>

158
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:12,569
Would you believe me if I told you
I was sent here from the future?

159
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:16,884
- Get out of here, sweetheart.
- Yeah.

160
00:19:16,947 --> 00:19:18,790
- We're gonna take care of this comedian.
- No, you're not.

161
00:19:18,908 --> 00:19:21,127
You're gonna give me the keys
to your car and some money for gas...

162
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:22,415
or you're gonna wake up in the hospital.

163
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:24,293
Trust me,
I know how these things play out.

164
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:26,006
Because you're from the future?

165
00:19:26,082 --> 00:19:27,129
No.

166
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:28,919
Because of these.

167
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:32,721
What the hell?

168
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:39,183
God damn it!

169
00:19:59,115 --> 00:20:01,117
Peaceful thoughts.

170
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:19,385
We are reviewing
all of our defense expenditures...

171
00:20:19,552 --> 00:20:21,600
and all the black books
are being opened.

172
00:20:21,762 --> 00:20:25,687
We can't support a weapon
that targets our own citizens.

173
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:27,477
If these mutants, as you describe...

174
00:20:28,018 --> 00:20:29,986
are already living among us...

175
00:20:30,146 --> 00:20:31,989
then they are living here peacefully.

176
00:20:32,148 --> 00:20:33,741
We haven't had an incident
in over 10 years.

177
00:20:33,816 --> 00:20:35,159
After what happened in Cuba?

178
00:20:35,276 --> 00:20:36,619
That was never confirmed.

179
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:38,996
We have very real enemies out there...

180
00:20:39,155 --> 00:20:40,498
the Russians, the Chinese.

181
00:20:40,573 --> 00:20:43,668
We are talking about a tenth
of a tenth...

182
00:20:43,826 --> 00:20:45,874
of a tenth of our population.

183
00:20:46,036 --> 00:20:48,380
Allow me to read something to you.

184
00:20:48,456 --> 00:20:49,582
Please.

185
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:52,544
This was acquired by our friends
at the CIA.

186
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:53,962
It's a dissertation...

187
00:20:54,044 --> 00:20:57,799
written by a mutant at Oxford University.

188
00:20:58,591 --> 00:20:59,968
And I quote...

189
00:21:00,426 --> 00:21:02,303
"To Homo Neanderthalensis...

190
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:04,689
"his mutant cousin, Homo Sapiens..."

191
00:21:05,139 --> 00:21:06,482
which is us...

192
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,642
"was an aberration.

193
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:11,938
"The arrival of the mutated human species,
Homo Sapiens...

194
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:16,450
"was followed by the immediate extinction
of their less evolved kin."

195
00:21:18,652 --> 00:21:23,078
Now, we are the Neanderthal.

196
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,038
Speak for yourself, Dr. Trask.

197
00:21:27,161 --> 00:21:29,880
You know,
when you sent our soldiers to Vietnam...

198
00:21:30,039 --> 00:21:31,666
without the weapons they needed
to win the war...

199
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:33,755
you underestimated your enemy.

200
00:21:34,585 --> 00:21:37,429
You do that with this enemy...

201
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:41,551
and it won't be some border skirmish
halfway around the world.

202
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:43,890
This time, the war will
be for our streets...

203
00:21:44,053 --> 00:21:46,272
our cities, our homes...

204
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:50,480
and by the time
you see the need for my program...

205
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:52,938
it will be too late...

206
00:21:53,103 --> 00:21:57,734
and you will have lost
two wars in one lifetime.

207
00:22:00,653 --> 00:22:02,781
We are sorry, Dr. Trask...

208
00:22:03,197 --> 00:22:05,541
but your Sentinel Program...

209
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:08,160
it ain't gonna fly.

210
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:21,928
Can I help you, Colonel?

211
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:24,305
Just here to give our boys
a proper send-off.

212
00:22:24,426 --> 00:22:27,771
I'm sorry, sir, but we have orders.
This is a quarantined area.

213
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:29,932
Stand aside, soldier.

214
00:22:30,099 --> 00:22:31,976
That's an order.

215
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:42,111
Atten-hut!

216
00:22:43,112 --> 00:22:44,204
At ease.

217
00:23:07,636 --> 00:23:08,888
What is all this?

218
00:23:08,971 --> 00:23:10,564
Lab reports, blood tests.

219
00:23:10,973 --> 00:23:12,395
It's all getting packed up
and shipped back.

220
00:23:12,474 --> 00:23:13,600
Where is it going?

221
00:23:13,684 --> 00:23:14,731
Same place they are.

222
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:16,816
Trask Industries.

223
00:23:18,355 --> 00:23:19,948
Let's go, gentlemen.

224
00:23:20,024 --> 00:23:22,322
I'm taking you out of this shit show.

225
00:23:22,484 --> 00:23:24,327
Shipping home?

226
00:23:25,362 --> 00:23:26,534
Not just yet.

227
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:28,741
What are you doing with those?

228
00:23:28,824 --> 00:23:30,622
Something to make the ride
a little smoother.

229
00:23:30,868 --> 00:23:33,212
I'm transferring you
to a private facility...

230
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:35,706
where we can run a few more tests.

231
00:23:41,337 --> 00:23:42,759
Your men are not military.

232
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:45,090
Private outfit.

233
00:23:45,549 --> 00:23:47,051
We're authorized to remand these men.

234
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,432
These troops are going home.

235
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:57,604
Well, Colonel, I don't believe
you have jurisdiction in this matter.

236
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:00,864
I'm afraid I do, son.

237
00:24:01,023 --> 00:24:02,149
I'm sorry, who are you?

238
00:24:02,775 --> 00:24:04,448
The question is, Major...

239
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:09,698
...who are you?

240
00:24:55,119 --> 00:24:56,211
Raven!

241
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:57,997
That's not my name.

242
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:05,592
I had that.

243
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:06,846
I know.

244
00:25:08,674 --> 00:25:10,642
Let's move out. Come on, let's go.

245
00:25:10,801 --> 00:25:11,973
Where's Erik?

246
00:25:12,136 --> 00:25:13,228
I'm on my own now.

247
00:25:16,682 --> 00:25:18,150
Let's go! Move it!

248
00:25:36,744 --> 00:25:38,291
Hold that plane!

249
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:41,631
Wouldn't wanna leave these boys
in this godforsaken country.

250
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:42,791
Yes, sir.

251
00:25:43,459 --> 00:25:45,336
You're not coming with us, are you?

252
00:25:45,794 --> 00:25:47,171
My war's not over.

253
00:25:47,337 --> 00:25:48,884
The enemy is still out there.

254
00:26:12,154 --> 00:26:14,077
The four privates, where did they go?

255
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:16,082
They were headed towards the tarmac.

256
00:27:14,842 --> 00:27:16,219
Can I help you?

257
00:27:17,219 --> 00:27:19,096
Yeah, what happened to the school?

258
00:27:19,263 --> 00:27:22,233
The school's been shut for years.
Are you a parent?

259
00:27:22,724 --> 00:27:25,022
I sure <i>as</i> hell hope not.
Who are you?

260
00:27:25,227 --> 00:27:27,229
I'm Hank. Hank McCoy.

261
00:27:27,354 --> 00:27:29,402
I look after the house now.

262
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:31,442
You're Beast?

263
00:27:31,525 --> 00:27:33,948
Look at you.
I guess you're a late bloomer.

264
00:27:34,069 --> 00:27:37,189
I don't know what you're talking about,
but I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.

265
00:27:37,573 --> 00:27:38,699
So where's the Professor?

266
00:27:38,782 --> 00:27:40,034
There's no professor here.

267
00:27:40,117 --> 00:27:42,245
You're pretty strong for a scrawny kid.

268
00:27:42,411 --> 00:27:44,709
You sure there's not
a little Beast in there?

269
00:27:44,788 --> 00:27:46,506
- No, he's not here.
- Come on, Beast.

270
00:27:46,582 --> 00:27:48,050
- Come on, Beastie.
- No.

271
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:52,672
I said the school's closed.

272
00:27:52,754 --> 00:27:54,834
- You need to leave.
- Not until I see the Professor.

273
00:27:54,923 --> 00:27:57,392
There's no professor here,
I told you that.

274
00:27:57,509 --> 00:28:01,059
Look, kid.
You and I are gonna be good friends.

275
00:28:03,307 --> 00:28:05,275
You just don't know it yet.

276
00:28:07,811 --> 00:28:09,313
Professor!

277
00:28:15,444 --> 00:28:16,661
Professor!

278
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:33,337
Hank?

279
00:28:33,503 --> 00:28:35,301
What's going on here?

280
00:28:36,632 --> 00:28:37,804
Professor?

281
00:28:37,883 --> 00:28:39,180
Please don't call me that.

282
00:28:39,301 --> 00:28:40,803
Why? You know this guy?

283
00:28:40,969 --> 00:28:43,267
Yeah, he looks slightly familiar.

284
00:28:43,347 --> 00:28:45,566
Get off the bloody chandelier, Hank.

285
00:28:47,434 --> 00:28:48,777
You can walk.

286
00:28:48,936 --> 00:28:50,153
You're a perceptive one.

287
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:51,817
I thought Erik...

288
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:55,075
Which makes it slightly perplexing that
you missed our sign on the way in.

289
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:56,402
This is private property, my friend.

290
00:28:56,485 --> 00:28:58,613
I'm gonna have to ask him
to ask you to leave.

291
00:29:00,239 --> 00:29:02,162
I'm afraid I can't do that...

292
00:29:04,534 --> 00:29:06,161
because I was sent here for you.

293
00:29:06,328 --> 00:29:09,298
Tell whoever it was that sent you
that I'm busy.

294
00:29:10,207 --> 00:29:11,567
That's gonna be a little tricky...

295
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,345
because the person who sent me was you.

296
00:29:15,504 --> 00:29:16,505
What?

297
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:18,261
About 50 years from now.

298
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:20,926
- Like in the future, 50 years from now?
- Yeah.

299
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:22,932
- I sent you from the future?
- Yeah.

300
00:29:23,512 --> 00:29:24,638
Piss off.

301
00:29:25,847 --> 00:29:28,441
If you had your powers,
you'd know I was telling the truth.

302
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:31,228
How do you know I don't have my p...

303
00:29:31,478 --> 00:29:33,071
- Who are you?
- I told you.

304
00:29:33,146 --> 00:29:34,614
- Are you CIA?
- No.

305
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:35,691
You've been watching me?

306
00:29:35,816 --> 00:29:37,489
I know you, Charles.

307
00:29:37,567 --> 00:29:39,569
We've been friends for years.

308
00:29:39,945 --> 00:29:41,697
I know your powers
came when you were 9.

309
00:29:42,531 --> 00:29:44,579
I know you thought you were going crazy
when it started...

310
00:29:44,741 --> 00:29:46,789
all the voices in your head.

311
00:29:46,868 --> 00:29:48,415
And it wasn't until you were 12...

312
00:29:48,495 --> 00:29:51,999
that you realized all the voices
were in everyone else's head.

313
00:29:52,165 --> 00:29:54,384
Do you want me to go on?

314
00:29:55,544 --> 00:29:57,046
I never told anyone that.

315
00:29:57,129 --> 00:30:00,759
Not yet, no, but, you will.

316
00:30:02,009 --> 00:30:05,104
All right, you've piqued my interest.
What do you want?

317
00:30:05,262 --> 00:30:07,356
We have to stop Raven.

318
00:30:09,683 --> 00:30:11,606
I need your help.

319
00:30:12,728 --> 00:30:14,526
We need your help.

320
00:30:18,734 --> 00:30:20,828
I think I'd like to wake up now.

321
00:30:25,907 --> 00:30:28,001
What does she have to do with this?

322
00:30:32,205 --> 00:30:33,878
<i>So you're saying...</i>

323
00:30:33,957 --> 00:30:36,176
they took Raven's power, and what?

324
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:38,720
They weaponized it?

325
00:30:38,879 --> 00:30:39,880
Yep.

326
00:30:40,339 --> 00:30:42,091
She is unique.

327
00:30:42,257 --> 00:30:44,180
Yeah, she is, Hank.

328
00:30:44,343 --> 00:30:47,267
In the beginning, the Sentinels
were just targeting mutants.

329
00:30:47,346 --> 00:30:50,225
Then they began to identify the genetics
in non-mutants...

330
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:54,979
who would eventually have mutant children
and grandchildren.

331
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:58,524
Many of the humans tried to help us,
but it was a slaughter.

332
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:01,693
Leaving only the worst of
humanity in charge.

333
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:03,828
I've been in a lot of wars.

334
00:31:05,947 --> 00:31:07,824
I'd never seen anything like this.

335
00:31:08,617 --> 00:31:10,119
And it all starts with her.

336
00:31:10,202 --> 00:31:12,671
Let's just say for the sake of...

337
00:31:13,663 --> 00:31:16,416
the sake, that I choose to believe you...

338
00:31:16,583 --> 00:31:19,632
that I choose to help you.
Raven won't listen to me.

339
00:31:21,797 --> 00:31:25,722
Her heart and soul
belong to someone else now.

340
00:31:26,134 --> 00:31:27,226
I know.

341
00:31:29,096 --> 00:31:31,724
That's why we're gonna need Magneto, too.

342
00:31:32,099 --> 00:31:33,521
Erik?

343
00:31:34,643 --> 00:31:36,065
- You do know where he is?
- Yeah.

344
00:31:42,609 --> 00:31:43,861
He's where he belongs.

345
00:31:44,945 --> 00:31:46,447
You're just gonna walk out?

346
00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:49,124
Top marks.
Like I said, you are perceptive.

347
00:31:49,199 --> 00:31:51,119
The Professor I know
would never turn his back...

348
00:31:51,243 --> 00:31:53,166
on someone who'd lost their path.

349
00:31:53,328 --> 00:31:55,330
Especially someone he loved.

350
00:31:57,749 --> 00:31:59,092
You know...

351
00:31:59,251 --> 00:32:01,379
I think I do remember you now.

352
00:32:01,545 --> 00:32:03,764
Yeah. We came to you a long time ago...

353
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:05,967
seeking your help.

354
00:32:06,508 --> 00:32:09,978
And I'm gonna say to you
what you said to us then.

355
00:32:11,721 --> 00:32:12,938
Fuck off.

356
00:32:13,432 --> 00:32:14,729
Listen to me, you little shit.

357
00:32:15,225 --> 00:32:18,354
I've come a long way,
and I've watched a lot of people die.

358
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:20,193
Good people. Friends.

359
00:32:20,439 --> 00:32:21,736
If you're gonna wallow in self-pity...

360
00:32:21,857 --> 00:32:23,700
and do nothing, then you're
gonna watch the same thing...

361
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:25,448
you understand?

362
00:32:30,198 --> 00:32:32,200
We all have to die sometime.

363
00:32:37,289 --> 00:32:38,916
Told you there was no professor here.

364
00:32:41,168 --> 00:32:43,011
What the hell happened to him?

365
00:32:46,923 --> 00:32:48,925
<i>He lost everything.</i>

366
00:32:49,092 --> 00:32:51,515
<i>Erik, Raven...</i>

367
00:32:51,678 --> 00:32:53,476
<i>his legs.</i>

368
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:56,517
<i>We built the school, the labs,
this whole place...</i>

369
00:32:56,725 --> 00:33:00,446
then, just after the first semester...

370
00:33:00,604 --> 00:33:02,197
the war in Vietnam got worse.

371
00:33:03,273 --> 00:33:04,775
Many of the teachers...

372
00:33:05,192 --> 00:33:07,786
and older students were drafted.

373
00:33:08,153 --> 00:33:09,496
It broke him.

374
00:33:09,946 --> 00:33:12,290
<i>He retreated into himself.</i>

375
00:33:12,449 --> 00:33:14,702
<i>I wanted to help, do something...</i>

376
00:33:14,868 --> 00:33:16,916
<i>so I designed a serum to treat his spine...</i>

377
00:33:17,078 --> 00:33:21,128
<i>derived from the same formula
that helps me control my mutation.</i>

378
00:33:22,375 --> 00:33:25,094
I take just enough
to keep myself balanced...

379
00:33:26,755 --> 00:33:28,223
but he takes too much.

380
00:33:28,632 --> 00:33:30,634
I tried easing him back...

381
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:34,304
but he just couldn't bear the pain,
the voices.

382
00:33:34,471 --> 00:33:36,940
The treatment gives him his legs...

383
00:33:37,682 --> 00:33:39,605
but it's not enough.

384
00:33:43,438 --> 00:33:45,111
He's just lost too much.

385
00:33:58,328 --> 00:33:59,955
<i>You're not scared of me?</i>

386
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:04,050
<i>I always believed
I couldn't be the only one in the world.</i>

387
00:34:04,918 --> 00:34:06,090
<i>Charles Xavier.</i>

388
00:34:08,797 --> 00:34:09,969
Raven.

389
00:34:11,341 --> 00:34:13,059
You're hungry and alone.

390
00:34:13,426 --> 00:34:17,897
Take whatever you want. We've got
lots of food. You don't have to steal.

391
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:20,107
In fact...

392
00:34:20,267 --> 00:34:22,770
<i>you never have to steal again.</i>

393
00:34:23,103 --> 00:34:25,105
<i>And that's a promise.</i>

394
00:34:30,652 --> 00:34:32,700
I'll help you get her.

395
00:34:34,281 --> 00:34:37,581
Not for any of your future shite,
but for her.

396
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:38,914
Fair enough.

397
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:42,206
But I'll tell you this.
You don't know Erik.

398
00:34:42,414 --> 00:34:45,008
That man is a monster. A murderer.

399
00:34:45,125 --> 00:34:49,096
You think you can convince Raven
to change? To come home?

400
00:34:49,504 --> 00:34:50,926
That's splendid.

401
00:34:51,798 --> 00:34:54,347
But what makes you think
you can change him?

402
00:34:54,509 --> 00:34:58,104
Because you and Erik sent
me back here together.

403
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:03,811
<i>The room they're holding him in
was built during the Second World War...</i>

404
00:35:03,977 --> 00:35:05,524
<i>when there was a shortage of steel.</i>

405
00:35:05,604 --> 00:35:09,450
<i>So the foundation is pure concrete
and sand. No metal.</i>

406
00:35:09,608 --> 00:35:10,700
He's being held...

407
00:35:10,859 --> 00:35:15,456
a hundred floors beneath the most
heavily guarded building on the planet.

408
00:35:15,614 --> 00:35:16,991
Why is he in there?

409
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:19,952
What, he forgot to mention?

410
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,167
JFK.

411
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:24,672
He killed...

412
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:29,632
What else explains a bullet
miraculously curving through the air?

413
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:31,421
Erik's always had a way with guns.

414
00:35:31,546 --> 00:35:33,266
Are you sure you want
to carry on with this?

415
00:35:33,298 --> 00:35:34,675
This is your plan, not mine.

416
00:35:34,758 --> 00:35:36,852
We don't have any resources
to get us in.

417
00:35:36,926 --> 00:35:38,599
Or out.

418
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:40,847
It's just me and Hank.

419
00:35:41,014 --> 00:35:42,357
I knew a guy.

420
00:35:42,557 --> 00:35:43,979
Yeah, he'd be a young man now.

421
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:46,444
Grew up outside of D.C.

422
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,113
He could get into anywhere.

423
00:35:49,272 --> 00:35:51,821
I just don't know
how the hell we're gonna find him.

424
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:55,825
Is Cerebro out of the question?

425
00:35:58,406 --> 00:36:00,625
We have a phonebook.

426
00:36:06,956 --> 00:36:09,254
I thought you'd be getting ready
for your trip, sir.

427
00:36:09,417 --> 00:36:11,294
I just came to grab a couple files.

428
00:36:11,461 --> 00:36:14,886
Is that a new scarf? It's nice.

429
00:36:15,048 --> 00:36:16,140
Thank you.

430
00:37:47,432 --> 00:37:48,684
Dr. Trask?

431
00:37:48,767 --> 00:37:49,859
One second.

432
00:37:52,187 --> 00:37:54,690
We added some names
to the Paris meeting.

433
00:37:58,193 --> 00:37:59,445
Thank you.

434
00:38:00,612 --> 00:38:01,955
Is something wrong, sir?

435
00:38:02,906 --> 00:38:05,034
No. It's nothing.

436
00:38:05,366 --> 00:38:07,960
Would you mind typing up my itinerary?

437
00:38:08,578 --> 00:38:10,125
I don't wanna miss anything.

438
00:38:18,421 --> 00:38:19,923
- Here, here, here.
- Where?

439
00:38:20,006 --> 00:38:21,428
- Just stop here.
- All right, all right.

440
00:38:21,591 --> 00:38:23,719
Next time I'm driving.
Don't get used to it.

441
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:43,196
What's he done now?

442
00:38:43,279 --> 00:38:45,031
I will just write you a check
for whatever he took.

443
00:38:45,198 --> 00:38:46,450
We just need to talk to him.

444
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:53,339
Peter! The cops are here. Again.

445
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:01,472
What do you guys want?

446
00:39:01,631 --> 00:39:04,305
I didn't do anything.
I've been here all day.

447
00:39:05,426 --> 00:39:07,394
Just relax, Peter. We're not cops.

448
00:39:07,554 --> 00:39:09,773
Of course you're not. If you were,
you wouldn't be driving a rental car.

449
00:39:09,931 --> 00:39:10,932
How did you know we've got a rental car?

450
00:39:11,057 --> 00:39:12,934
I checked your registration
when you were walking to the door.

451
00:39:13,101 --> 00:39:15,103
I also had some time to kill
so I went through your rental agreement.

452
00:39:15,270 --> 00:39:17,364
Saw you were from out of town.
Are you FBI?

453
00:39:18,314 --> 00:39:20,442
No, you're not cops.
What's with this gifted youngsters place?

454
00:39:20,608 --> 00:39:22,952
That's an old card.

455
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:26,197
- He's fascinating.
- He's a pain in the arse.

456
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:27,536
What, a teleporter?

457
00:39:27,699 --> 00:39:28,791
No, he's just fast.

458
00:39:28,908 --> 00:39:31,331
And when I knew him he wasn't so... young.

459
00:39:32,161 --> 00:39:34,004
Young? You're just old.

460
00:39:34,998 --> 00:39:36,875
So you're not afraid to show your powers?

461
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:38,601
What powers?
What are you talking about?

462
00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:40,845
Do you see something strange here?

463
00:39:42,005 --> 00:39:44,133
Nothing anybody would believe
if you told them.

464
00:39:48,261 --> 00:39:49,808
So, who are you?
What do you want?

465
00:39:49,888 --> 00:39:51,561
- We need your help, Peter.
- For what?

466
00:39:51,723 --> 00:39:53,771
To break into a highly secured facility...

467
00:39:54,183 --> 00:39:55,480
and to get someone out.

468
00:39:55,643 --> 00:39:56,690
Prison break?

469
00:39:57,353 --> 00:39:58,525
That's illegal, you know.

470
00:40:02,901 --> 00:40:04,744
Only if you get caught.

471
00:40:04,903 --> 00:40:05,950
So, what's in it for me?

472
00:40:06,029 --> 00:40:09,408
You, you kleptomaniac,
get to break into the Pentagon.

473
00:40:15,330 --> 00:40:17,003
How do I know I can trust you?

474
00:40:17,999 --> 00:40:19,501
Because we're just like you.

475
00:40:21,794 --> 00:40:23,011
Show him.

476
00:40:34,891 --> 00:40:36,859
That's cool, but it's disgusting.

477
00:40:38,686 --> 00:40:43,487
Built in 1943, the Pentagon
is the world's largest office building...

478
00:40:43,650 --> 00:40:46,529
housing more than
25,000 military employees...

479
00:40:46,694 --> 00:40:48,287
stretched over six million square feet.

480
00:40:48,363 --> 00:40:49,364
Where's the bathroom?

481
00:40:49,864 --> 00:40:51,582
He always needs to pee!

482
00:40:52,367 --> 00:40:53,744
Lucky for you, you'll have...

483
00:41:55,263 --> 00:41:57,544
We're getting broadcast signal down here.
What's going on?

484
00:41:57,598 --> 00:41:59,441
Damn it, call Maintenance,
get them down here.

485
00:43:36,364 --> 00:43:40,164
...fought for and captured the island
of lwo Jima from the Japanese Empire.

486
00:43:40,827 --> 00:43:42,204
Now, this month-long battle...

487
00:43:42,370 --> 00:43:45,590
included some of the fiercest fighting
during World War ll in the Pacific...

488
00:44:01,389 --> 00:44:03,733
In three seconds,
those doors are going to open...

489
00:44:03,891 --> 00:44:06,235
and 20 guards will be here to shoot us.

490
00:44:07,270 --> 00:44:09,068
I know. That's what I'm waiting for.

491
00:44:09,147 --> 00:44:10,239
What are you doing?

492
00:44:10,314 --> 00:44:11,987
I'm holding your neck so
you don't get whiplash.

493
00:44:12,066 --> 00:44:13,067
What?

494
00:44:13,192 --> 00:44:15,411
Whiplash.

495
00:44:19,907 --> 00:44:21,250
Don't move!

496
00:44:36,257 --> 00:44:38,760
You're good, it'll pass.
It happens with everyone.

497
00:44:41,262 --> 00:44:43,435
You must have done
something pretty serious.

498
00:44:43,556 --> 00:44:44,978
What did you do, man?

499
00:44:45,057 --> 00:44:46,559
What did you do?

500
00:44:46,642 --> 00:44:48,360
What did you do?
Why'd they have you in there?

501
00:44:48,436 --> 00:44:50,234
For killing the President.

502
00:44:51,898 --> 00:44:54,196
WOW. Shit.

503
00:44:54,984 --> 00:44:58,329
The only thing I'm guilty of
is fighting for people like us.

504
00:44:58,487 --> 00:45:00,364
You take karate? You know karate, man?

505
00:45:00,448 --> 00:45:02,576
I don't know karate.

506
00:45:02,742 --> 00:45:04,119
But I know crazy.

507
00:45:05,161 --> 00:45:08,005
Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls,
this is a Code Red situation.

508
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:10,082
We are evacuating the entire floor...

509
00:45:10,166 --> 00:45:12,885
so that my associate and I...

510
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:14,587
can secure the prison.

511
00:45:14,670 --> 00:45:17,844
- Who are you?
- We're special operations, CB...

512
00:45:17,965 --> 00:45:19,262
FB-CID.

513
00:45:19,342 --> 00:45:22,186
Perhaps you didn't hear me
when first I spoke...

514
00:45:22,261 --> 00:45:24,104
but it is imperative
that you understand...

515
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:27,480
we're in a complete lockdown situation.
We have to get you to the third floor...

516
00:45:34,523 --> 00:45:36,571
I'm sorry. Were you finished?

517
00:45:41,781 --> 00:45:43,658
They told me you control metal.

518
00:45:44,033 --> 00:45:45,250
"They"?

519
00:45:48,204 --> 00:45:51,424
You know, my mom once knew a guy
who could do that.

520
00:45:54,001 --> 00:45:56,925
I'm sorry, I'm just not
very good with violence.

521
00:45:59,799 --> 00:46:01,301
Charles?

522
00:46:08,015 --> 00:46:09,938
Good to see you too, old friend.

523
00:46:10,101 --> 00:46:11,227
And walking.

524
00:46:11,352 --> 00:46:12,820
No thanks to you.

525
00:46:14,272 --> 00:46:16,741
You're the last person in the world
I expected to see today.

526
00:46:16,899 --> 00:46:18,196
Believe me...

527
00:46:18,359 --> 00:46:20,032
I wouldn't be here if I didn't have to.

528
00:46:20,361 --> 00:46:22,363
If we get you out of here,
we do it my way.

529
00:46:22,530 --> 00:46:23,531
No killing.

530
00:46:23,948 --> 00:46:24,949
No helmet.

531
00:46:25,574 --> 00:46:27,542
I couldn't disobey you even if I wanted.

532
00:46:27,702 --> 00:46:30,251
I'm never getting inside
of that head again.

533
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:33,548
I need your word, Erik.

534
00:46:36,752 --> 00:46:37,878
Nobody move!

535
00:46:38,379 --> 00:46:40,381
Hold it right there!

536
00:46:42,425 --> 00:46:44,098
- Charles.
- Don't move.

537
00:46:44,260 --> 00:46:46,262
Hands up, or we will shoot!

538
00:46:46,429 --> 00:46:48,056
- Freeze them, Charles.
- I can't.

539
00:46:48,139 --> 00:46:49,436
Hands up!

540
00:46:54,103 --> 00:46:55,195
No!

541
00:48:48,509 --> 00:48:50,011
Thanks, kid.

542
00:48:54,682 --> 00:48:56,730
Peter, thank you very, very much.

543
00:48:56,892 --> 00:48:57,893
You take care.

544
00:48:58,060 --> 00:49:00,660
I saw your flight plan in the cockpit.
Why are you going to Paris?

545
00:49:12,032 --> 00:49:13,784
Imagine if they were metal.

546
00:49:15,202 --> 00:49:16,962
- Do me a favor and return it for me.
- Okay.

547
00:49:17,037 --> 00:49:18,380
And, Peter?

548
00:49:18,873 --> 00:49:20,125
Take it slow.

549
00:49:21,250 --> 00:49:23,127
Where did they dig you up?

550
00:49:24,420 --> 00:49:26,718
You're gonna find
this hard to believe...

551
00:49:27,965 --> 00:49:29,717
but you sent me.

552
00:49:29,884 --> 00:49:32,057
You and Charles.

553
00:49:32,219 --> 00:49:33,812
From the future.

554
00:49:56,243 --> 00:49:58,416
How did you lose them?

555
00:49:58,579 --> 00:50:00,832
The treatment for my spine affects my DNA.

556
00:50:03,667 --> 00:50:06,170
You sacrificed your powers
so you could walk?

557
00:50:07,004 --> 00:50:10,178
I sacrificed my powers
so that I could sleep.

558
00:50:12,635 --> 00:50:13,761
What do you know about it?

559
00:50:13,928 --> 00:50:15,180
I've lost my fair share.

560
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:18,432
Dry your eyes, Erik.

561
00:50:18,599 --> 00:50:20,272
It doesn't justify what you've done.

562
00:50:20,434 --> 00:50:22,107
You have no idea what I've done.

563
00:50:22,269 --> 00:50:23,942
I know that you took the things
that mean the most to me.

564
00:50:24,271 --> 00:50:26,524
Maybe you should have
fought harder for them.

565
00:50:26,607 --> 00:50:27,904
If you want a fight, Erik...

566
00:50:27,983 --> 00:50:29,583
- Sit down.
- ...l will give you a fight!

567
00:50:29,610 --> 00:50:30,736
Let him come.

568
00:50:30,819 --> 00:50:32,571
You abandoned me!

569
00:50:32,655 --> 00:50:33,872
You took her away...

570
00:50:33,948 --> 00:50:35,040
and you abandoned me!

571
00:50:35,199 --> 00:50:36,621
Angel.

572
00:50:36,951 --> 00:50:38,294
Azazel.

573
00:50:38,953 --> 00:50:40,796
Emma.

574
00:50:40,955 --> 00:50:42,332
Banshee.

575
00:50:43,290 --> 00:50:44,963
Mutant brothers and sisters...

576
00:50:45,125 --> 00:50:46,593
all dead!

577
00:50:49,129 --> 00:50:50,551
Countless others...

578
00:50:50,631 --> 00:50:51,678
experimented on.

579
00:50:51,757 --> 00:50:52,804
Butchered!

580
00:50:52,883 --> 00:50:53,884
Erik!

581
00:50:53,968 --> 00:50:55,094
Where were you, Charles?

582
00:50:55,469 --> 00:50:57,767
We were supposed to protect them!

583
00:50:58,305 --> 00:51:00,649
Where were you
when your own people needed you?

584
00:51:00,808 --> 00:51:02,902
Hiding! You and Hank!

585
00:51:03,310 --> 00:51:05,062
Pretending to be something you're not!

586
00:51:05,646 --> 00:51:07,023
Erik!

587
00:51:08,857 --> 00:51:11,406
You abandoned us all.

588
00:51:31,547 --> 00:51:33,766
So, you were always an asshole.

589
00:51:36,343 --> 00:51:38,892
I take it we're best buddies in the future.

590
00:51:40,514 --> 00:51:43,688
I spent a lot of years
trying to bring you down, bub.

591
00:51:44,268 --> 00:51:46,020
How does that work out for you?

592
00:51:46,186 --> 00:51:47,904
You're like me.

593
00:51:49,064 --> 00:51:50,816
You're a survivor.

594
00:51:54,903 --> 00:51:56,303
Do you wanna pick all that shit up?

595
00:52:15,049 --> 00:52:19,600
General, maybe you should slow down,
we have a big day tomorrow.

596
00:52:20,554 --> 00:52:26,277
We're celebrating, captain. It's not every day you
win a war, let alone against the American devils.

597
00:52:28,479 --> 00:52:30,106
I'm getting another bottle.

598
00:52:47,164 --> 00:52:48,256
Excuse me.

599
00:52:48,457 --> 00:52:51,381
I'm pretty sure it was my fault.

600
00:52:51,752 --> 00:52:53,174
You speak Vietnamese.

601
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:54,512
I'm an interpreter.

602
00:52:56,507 --> 00:52:59,010
I speak many tongues.

603
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:01,933
Let me buy you another drink...

604
00:53:02,262 --> 00:53:04,356
unless you're here with someone.

605
00:53:05,057 --> 00:53:07,401
I'm alone.

606
00:53:08,644 --> 00:53:10,942
A bottle of Johnnie Walker please.

607
00:53:25,703 --> 00:53:28,377
You're going to the Summit tomorrow?

608
00:53:33,460 --> 00:53:38,466
A pretty girl interested in politics...

609
00:53:38,549 --> 00:53:41,143
Looks can be deceiving.

610
00:53:41,552 --> 00:53:43,020
Lady!-

611
00:53:43,804 --> 00:53:47,024
Show me more, baby?

612
00:53:48,809 --> 00:53:51,403
Clothes off?

613
00:54:03,866 --> 00:54:07,916
What's the matter, baby?
You don't think I look pretty like this?

614
00:54:54,416 --> 00:54:57,215
Fancy a game? It's been a while.

615
00:54:57,377 --> 00:54:59,050
I'm not in the mood for games, thank you.

616
00:55:05,928 --> 00:55:08,852
I haven't had a real sip in ten years.

617
00:55:21,652 --> 00:55:22,995
I didn't kill the President.

618
00:55:23,779 --> 00:55:26,077
The bullet curved, Erik.

619
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:27,742
Because I was trying to save him.

620
00:55:29,284 --> 00:55:30,831
They took me out before I could.

621
00:55:30,994 --> 00:55:32,041
Why would you try and save him?

622
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:34,748
Because he was one of us.

623
00:55:45,926 --> 00:55:48,349
You must think me so foolish.

624
00:55:49,930 --> 00:55:51,932
We've always said they
would come after us.

625
00:55:52,099 --> 00:55:55,444
I never imagined they'd use
Raven's DNA to do it.

626
00:55:56,311 --> 00:55:57,608
When did you last see her?

627
00:56:01,275 --> 00:56:03,152
The day I left for Dallas.

628
00:56:04,152 --> 00:56:05,449
And how was she?

629
00:56:07,447 --> 00:56:08,448
Strong.

630
00:56:09,324 --> 00:56:10,325
Driven.

631
00:56:11,493 --> 00:56:12,540
Loyal.

632
00:56:13,704 --> 00:56:15,377
How was she?

633
00:56:17,124 --> 00:56:18,296
She was...

634
00:56:20,043 --> 00:56:21,795
We were...

635
00:56:25,299 --> 00:56:27,643
I could see why she meant so much to you.

636
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:31,893
You should be proud of her, Charles.

637
00:56:33,473 --> 00:56:35,350
She's out there fighting for our cause.

638
00:56:35,517 --> 00:56:36,894
Your cause.

639
00:56:37,686 --> 00:56:40,485
The girl I raised was
not capable of killing.

640
00:56:40,647 --> 00:56:42,149
You didn't raise her,
you grew up with her.

641
00:56:42,316 --> 00:56:44,364
She couldn't stay a little girl forever,
that's why she left.

642
00:56:44,526 --> 00:56:47,405
She left because you got inside her head.

643
00:56:49,406 --> 00:56:51,329
That's not my power.

644
00:56:53,327 --> 00:56:54,670
She made a choice.

645
00:56:54,828 --> 00:56:57,672
But now we know where
that choice leads, don't we?

646
00:56:57,998 --> 00:57:00,501
She's going to murder Trask,
they're going to capture her...

647
00:57:01,168 --> 00:57:03,421
and then they're going to wipe us out.

648
00:57:03,587 --> 00:57:05,510
Not if we get to her first.

649
00:57:06,715 --> 00:57:08,934
Not if we change history tomorrow.

650
00:57:14,431 --> 00:57:16,104
I'm sorry, Charles...

651
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:21,521
for what happened.

652
00:57:22,356 --> 00:57:23,699
I truly am.

653
00:57:27,778 --> 00:57:29,218
It's been a while since I've played.

654
00:57:32,199 --> 00:57:33,576
I'll go easy on you.

655
00:57:35,452 --> 00:57:37,375
Might finally be a fair fight.

656
00:57:38,705 --> 00:57:40,082
You have the first move.

657
00:57:54,888 --> 00:57:59,064
<i>The diplomats from all around the world
are arriving here today at the Hotel Royal.</i>

658
00:57:59,226 --> 00:58:00,648
<i>It's an historic day.</i>

659
00:58:00,811 --> 00:58:05,942
<i>It's the official ending of the United
States' military involvement in Vietnam.</i>

660
00:58:06,108 --> 00:58:08,236
<i>There we have
the South Vietnamese Foreign Minister...</i>

661
00:58:08,402 --> 00:58:10,075
<i>with other South Vietnamese dignitaries.</i>

662
00:58:10,988 --> 00:58:13,241
The Summit doesn't begin
for another hour.

663
00:58:13,407 --> 00:58:16,581
The hotel has arranged a private room
upstairs for your special guests.

664
00:58:16,743 --> 00:58:18,745
That will be plenty of time.

665
00:58:22,833 --> 00:58:26,804
Good afternoon, everyone.
Hello, thank you for coming.

666
00:58:26,962 --> 00:58:29,590
Congratulations on winning this war.

667
00:58:30,090 --> 00:58:34,436
Now, I know you all have hands to shake
and photos to take downstairs...

668
00:58:34,594 --> 00:58:36,642
so I will get right to the point.

669
00:58:37,431 --> 00:58:39,684
There is a new enemy out there.

670
00:58:39,850 --> 00:58:42,353
An enemy that will
render your arsenals useless...

671
00:58:42,519 --> 00:58:43,816
your armies powerless...

672
00:58:43,979 --> 00:58:45,856
and your nations defenseless.

673
00:58:51,611 --> 00:58:55,491
<i>You will need a new weapon for this war.
I call them Sentinels.</i>

674
00:58:57,325 --> 00:59:01,205
Named after the ancient guardians
that stood at the gates of the citadel.

675
00:59:03,457 --> 00:59:06,301
They have the aeronautic capabilities
of a Harrier jet.

676
00:59:07,294 --> 00:59:09,638
Armed with guns that can fire off...

677
00:59:09,796 --> 00:59:13,801
<i>more than 2,000 rounds per minute
of thermoceramic ammunition.</i>

678
00:59:13,967 --> 00:59:16,470
But size, power, speed...

679
00:59:16,636 --> 00:59:18,559
you could find that at Lockheed or Boeing.

680
00:59:18,722 --> 00:59:21,225
No, what makes the Sentinels
so special...

681
00:59:21,391 --> 00:59:24,861
is the ability to target
the mutant X-gene.

682
00:59:25,020 --> 00:59:29,196
A genetic guidance system that can
lock onto a mark a half a mile away.

683
00:59:29,357 --> 00:59:32,361
It won't trigger
unless it has identified the target.

684
00:59:32,527 --> 00:59:36,077
With this weapon, there will be
no human collateral damage.

685
00:59:36,239 --> 00:59:39,083
If I turn it on, the system
couldn't even activate in here.

686
00:59:46,833 --> 00:59:50,679
Unless there's a mutant.

687
00:59:59,221 --> 01:00:01,940
There has to be a some kind of mistake.

688
01:00:03,558 --> 01:00:06,232
My machines don't make mistakes.

689
01:00:08,688 --> 01:00:10,065
What are you?

690
01:00:11,024 --> 01:00:12,776
I assure you...

691
01:00:14,861 --> 01:00:15,862
No, don't shoot it.

692
01:00:16,530 --> 01:00:19,374
I assure you,
I don't know what you're talking about.

693
01:00:53,817 --> 01:00:54,864
Raven!

694
01:01:00,282 --> 01:01:02,159
Raven? Raven!

695
01:01:06,246 --> 01:01:07,589
Raven?

696
01:01:09,749 --> 01:01:10,921
Charles?

697
01:01:11,084 --> 01:01:13,337
We've come for you, Erik and I.

698
01:01:13,503 --> 01:01:14,504
Together.

699
01:01:15,505 --> 01:01:17,678
I never thought I'd see you again.

700
01:01:17,841 --> 01:01:21,311
I made you a promise a long time ago
that I would protect you.

701
01:01:34,316 --> 01:01:35,533
I'm going to keep you safe.

702
01:01:35,692 --> 01:01:37,319
I'm going to keep you
out of their hands.

703
01:01:41,281 --> 01:01:42,624
Erik?

704
01:01:43,783 --> 01:01:45,956
Erik? What are you doing?

705
01:01:47,621 --> 01:01:49,168
Securing our future.

706
01:01:49,873 --> 01:01:51,295
Forgive me, Mystique.

707
01:01:51,666 --> 01:01:54,135
As long <i>as</i> you're out there,
we'll never be safe.

708
01:01:55,295 --> 01:01:56,421
Erik...

709
01:01:56,504 --> 01:01:58,506
Use your power, Charles. Stop him.

710
01:01:58,673 --> 01:01:59,799
He can't.

711
01:02:30,664 --> 01:02:32,166
He's slipping back.

712
01:02:32,332 --> 01:02:33,549
I'm losing him.

713
01:03:15,208 --> 01:03:16,255
<i>Stryker!</i>

714
01:03:16,710 --> 01:03:18,758
<i>Someone will finish
what we've started, Wolverine!</i>

715
01:03:18,920 --> 01:03:19,967
<i>One day!</i>

716
01:03:25,343 --> 01:03:26,344
Restrain him.

717
01:03:41,568 --> 01:03:42,569
Erik!

718
01:03:52,746 --> 01:03:53,918
Where am I?

719
01:03:56,791 --> 01:03:58,088
How the hell did I get here?

720
01:03:58,251 --> 01:03:59,844
What? You came to us.

721
01:04:00,837 --> 01:04:02,089
- Who are you?
- Charles.

722
01:04:02,589 --> 01:04:04,933
- Charles Xavier!
- I don't know you.

723
01:04:06,009 --> 01:04:07,010
What the hell is that?

724
01:04:08,178 --> 01:04:10,476
Look, I can deal with this. Just go.

725
01:04:10,764 --> 01:04:12,141
Stop Erik!

726
01:04:12,599 --> 01:04:14,943
- Erik, please...
- I'm sorry.

727
01:04:15,101 --> 01:04:16,273
Erik...

728
01:04:35,038 --> 01:04:37,336
You're Logan, that's Hank McCoy,
I'm Charles Xavier.

729
01:04:37,499 --> 01:04:39,968
You spent the last
couple of days with us.

730
01:04:43,338 --> 01:04:44,965
You're on acid.

731
01:04:45,799 --> 01:04:49,849
Somebody gave you really bad acid, yeah?

732
01:05:34,514 --> 01:05:36,892
Just hold on tight,
we'll get through this together.

733
01:05:38,393 --> 01:05:39,690
Oh, my God, Kitty.

734
01:05:41,855 --> 01:05:42,856
She's wounded pretty bad.

735
01:06:48,171 --> 01:06:49,263
I got him.

736
01:06:54,010 --> 01:06:55,011
Professor?

737
01:06:55,762 --> 01:06:56,854
What happened to you?

738
01:06:58,431 --> 01:07:01,435
I just saw someone who's gonna
bring me a lot of pain someday.

739
01:07:04,270 --> 01:07:05,271
Where's Raven?

740
01:07:05,939 --> 01:07:07,191
- Gone.
- What?

741
01:07:07,357 --> 01:07:09,325
We have to get out of here.

742
01:07:09,734 --> 01:07:11,974
We want to know if there's
any sort of connection with...

743
01:07:18,368 --> 01:07:20,041
<i>Yesterday, the Paris Peace Summit...</i>

744
01:07:20,203 --> 01:07:22,922
<i>was rocked by the appearance
of unidentified assailants...</i>

745
01:07:23,039 --> 01:07:25,337
<i>the likes of which
the world has never seen.</i>

746
01:07:25,500 --> 01:07:28,219
<i>Mass hysteria has gripped the nation
as people ask...</i>

747
01:07:28,378 --> 01:07:30,631
<i>"Where did they come from?
Will they be back?"</i>

748
01:07:30,797 --> 01:07:33,721
<i>And most importantly,
"Are they friend or foe?"</i>

749
01:07:33,883 --> 01:07:36,887
<i>That was London correspondent
Toby Elliot...</i>

750
01:07:37,053 --> 01:07:38,933
<i>reporting from the
Paris Peace Summit yesterday.</i>

751
01:07:40,056 --> 01:07:42,684
What the hell are we dealing with here?
Off the record.

752
01:07:43,476 --> 01:07:46,855
Two days ago, this man,
Erik Lehnsherr...

753
01:07:47,021 --> 01:07:49,524
escaped from a maximum security prison
inside the Pentagon.

754
01:07:49,691 --> 01:07:53,412
We believe that this woman
is a former associate of Lehnsherr's.

755
01:07:53,570 --> 01:07:57,575
They were together in Cuba,
the day of the crisis in '62.

756
01:07:57,740 --> 01:08:01,415
He was also implicated
in Kennedy's assassination.

757
01:08:02,537 --> 01:08:03,914
What about that thing?

758
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:05,600
We don't know what that thing is, sir.

759
01:08:05,748 --> 01:08:08,046
Actually, we really don't know
what any of them are.

760
01:08:08,209 --> 01:08:10,758
Yes. Yes, we do.

761
01:08:11,588 --> 01:08:13,010
They're mutants.

762
01:08:14,382 --> 01:08:18,353
He has the power to control metal.

763
01:08:18,511 --> 01:08:21,355
Last I checked, that's what
most of your weapons were made of.

764
01:08:21,556 --> 01:08:25,402
And she can transform into anyone.

765
01:08:25,560 --> 01:08:28,359
A general, a secret serviceman.

766
01:08:28,521 --> 01:08:29,773
Even you, Mr. President.

767
01:08:30,440 --> 01:08:31,800
She could walk into this office...

768
01:08:31,858 --> 01:08:35,533
and order a nuclear strike
if she was in the mood.

769
01:08:35,695 --> 01:08:37,288
And that's only two of them.

770
01:08:37,447 --> 01:08:40,451
Do we have any countermeasures?
Any defense?

771
01:08:40,617 --> 01:08:42,870
I was waiting for you
to ask me that question.

772
01:08:43,202 --> 01:08:46,957
That's an experimental program, sir.
Strictly off the books.

773
01:08:55,757 --> 01:08:58,431
You're telling me
these mutants are out in the world...

774
01:08:58,593 --> 01:09:01,062
and our best defense
are these giant metal robots?

775
01:09:01,220 --> 01:09:03,268
Many of the mutants look like us.

776
01:09:03,723 --> 01:09:05,896
My Sentinels can tell the difference.

777
01:09:06,142 --> 01:09:08,440
I have eight prototypes ready to go.

778
01:09:08,603 --> 01:09:12,278
They're built out of a space-age polymer,
not an ounce of metal on them.

779
01:09:18,905 --> 01:09:20,248
I want to make a demonstration.

780
01:09:20,406 --> 01:09:22,659
I want the world to know
that we can protect them.

781
01:09:23,159 --> 01:09:24,786
What do you need
to get these things operational?

782
01:09:24,952 --> 01:09:26,512
I already gave that number to Congress.

783
01:09:26,663 --> 01:09:29,416
Unfortunately,
they elected to shut me down.

784
01:09:29,582 --> 01:09:32,176
It's going to cost a bit more
to turn them on.

785
01:09:32,335 --> 01:09:35,339
- Whatever you need.
- And one more thing.

786
01:09:35,505 --> 01:09:38,930
If we do manage to capture them,
I would like her.

787
01:09:39,092 --> 01:09:41,015
For research purposes, of course.

788
01:09:46,849 --> 01:09:48,271
Terrible thing.

789
01:09:49,435 --> 01:09:50,812
What is?

790
01:09:51,270 --> 01:09:52,772
Being born like that.

791
01:09:52,855 --> 01:09:53,981
Is it?

792
01:09:54,315 --> 01:09:56,613
Can you imagine...

793
01:09:56,859 --> 01:09:59,533
Looking in the mirror and seeing that
staring back at you?

794
01:10:00,613 --> 01:10:03,366
Yes, I can.

795
01:10:05,618 --> 01:10:08,246
Where do you think she comes from?

796
01:10:08,496 --> 01:10:11,295
You think she has a family?

797
01:10:12,959 --> 01:10:14,506
Yes.

798
01:10:14,669 --> 01:10:16,512
She does.

799
01:11:04,218 --> 01:11:08,348
If I see so much as a screw move,
I will jam this into your throat.

800
01:11:09,098 --> 01:11:10,691
How did you find me?

801
01:11:10,850 --> 01:11:12,352
You taught me well.

802
01:11:12,518 --> 01:11:14,862
It's been a long time
since we were this close.

803
01:11:16,355 --> 01:11:17,732
I missed you.

804
01:11:17,899 --> 01:11:19,572
You tried to kill me.

805
01:11:19,734 --> 01:11:21,862
So the rest of us could live.

806
01:11:23,362 --> 01:11:24,614
What do you mean?

807
01:11:25,198 --> 01:11:27,200
We received a message from the future.

808
01:11:27,366 --> 01:11:29,289
Don't lie to me.

809
01:11:29,911 --> 01:11:31,913
I never have, and I never will.

810
01:11:33,539 --> 01:11:38,420
Humans use your blood, your genes,
to create a weapon that wipes us all out.

811
01:11:38,586 --> 01:11:42,056
I was only doing what I thought
necessary to secure our future.

812
01:11:42,215 --> 01:11:45,389
So what's to stop me from killing you
right now and securing my future?

813
01:11:46,427 --> 01:11:47,553
Nothing.

814
01:11:48,805 --> 01:11:50,728
It doesn't matter anymore.

815
01:11:50,890 --> 01:11:53,734
They have your DNA.
Your blood was on the street.

816
01:11:54,393 --> 01:11:55,736
Whose fault was that?

817
01:11:57,396 --> 01:11:58,818
Mine.

818
01:11:59,732 --> 01:12:03,077
I've seen their plans.
They're creating a weapon.

819
01:12:03,236 --> 01:12:06,160
And now they have what they need
to take it further.

820
01:12:08,449 --> 01:12:11,794
We have to strike now,
while we still hold the upper hand.

821
01:12:14,622 --> 01:12:16,670
I've seen too many friends die, Erik.

822
01:12:18,751 --> 01:12:22,927
I don't want a war.
I only want the man who murdered them.

823
01:12:23,089 --> 01:12:24,591
This is war.

824
01:12:26,425 --> 01:12:28,268
What happened to you?

825
01:12:29,095 --> 01:12:31,348
Did you lose your way
while I was gone?

826
01:12:33,349 --> 01:12:35,443
Are you still Charles' Raven?

827
01:12:37,770 --> 01:12:40,193
Or are you Mystique?

828
01:12:43,609 --> 01:12:45,156
Trask is the enemy.

829
01:12:47,321 --> 01:12:49,369
Killing one man isn't enough.

830
01:12:49,782 --> 01:12:51,125
It never was for you.

831
01:12:52,493 --> 01:12:53,710
Goodbye, Erik.

832
01:13:18,936 --> 01:13:20,108
What happened?

833
01:13:20,187 --> 01:13:21,814
- Come on.
- Can he walk?

834
01:13:21,981 --> 01:13:23,153
He needs his treatment.

835
01:13:23,649 --> 01:13:25,993
- I can hear them.
- I know. It's okay.

836
01:13:26,152 --> 01:13:28,200
- Can you make it stop?
- I'll get them.

837
01:13:30,197 --> 01:13:31,323
Hey, hey.

838
01:13:31,449 --> 01:13:33,167
Pull yourself together.

839
01:13:33,326 --> 01:13:34,828
It's not over yet.

840
01:13:37,997 --> 01:13:39,374
You don't believe that.

841
01:13:41,292 --> 01:13:42,669
How do you know?

842
01:13:42,835 --> 01:13:44,508
As these go...

843
01:13:46,213 --> 01:13:49,513
this comes back.

844
01:13:50,176 --> 01:13:52,520
They all come back.

845
01:13:57,683 --> 01:13:59,105
Look.

846
01:13:59,852 --> 01:14:01,525
I'm still here...

847
01:14:02,563 --> 01:14:04,065
and she's still out there.

848
01:14:06,233 --> 01:14:08,361
We need your help, Charles.

849
01:14:08,945 --> 01:14:10,538
Not like this. I need you.

850
01:14:10,988 --> 01:14:14,242
We can't find Raven.
Not without your powers.

851
01:14:17,870 --> 01:14:20,214
I added a little extra
because you missed a dose.

852
01:14:25,878 --> 01:14:27,050
Charles.

853
01:14:58,411 --> 01:15:00,539
Hank, do me a favor.

854
01:15:01,247 --> 01:15:03,545
Would you help me to my study, please?

855
01:15:08,546 --> 01:15:10,298
Come on, I got you.

856
01:15:20,433 --> 01:15:22,731
Are you sure about this?

857
01:15:24,103 --> 01:15:26,231
Absolutely not.

858
01:15:32,778 --> 01:15:34,951
This creature is extraordinary.

859
01:15:36,157 --> 01:15:39,912
Her genes could hold the key
to mutation itself.

860
01:15:39,994 --> 01:15:41,086
I need more.

861
01:15:41,162 --> 01:15:44,006
That's all they were able to scrape off
the pavement in Paris.

862
01:15:44,165 --> 01:15:45,337
More than blood.

863
01:15:45,833 --> 01:15:47,631
I need brain tissue...

864
01:15:47,793 --> 01:15:50,421
spinal fluid, bone marrow.

865
01:15:51,547 --> 01:15:52,719
Imagine...

866
01:15:52,798 --> 01:15:55,677
Sentinels that could transform,
adapt to any target.

867
01:15:56,469 --> 01:15:58,597
If I could just get my hands on her.

868
01:15:58,763 --> 01:16:02,438
This girl could leap
the program forward years...

869
01:16:02,600 --> 01:16:04,477
decades into the future.

870
01:16:05,811 --> 01:16:07,108
How old is your son now, Major?

871
01:16:08,439 --> 01:16:09,531
Jason?

872
01:16:09,690 --> 01:16:11,692
He's coming up on ten now,
if you can believe it.

873
01:16:11,776 --> 01:16:13,278
Eight years from fighting age.

874
01:16:13,527 --> 01:16:17,202
And how many of our sons and brothers
did we just ship home in body bags?

875
01:16:17,364 --> 01:16:19,332
Maybe fifty, fifty-five thousand?

876
01:16:19,492 --> 01:16:20,960
And how many more on the other side?

877
01:16:22,495 --> 01:16:24,338
Never before...

878
01:16:24,497 --> 01:16:27,501
in all of human history...

879
01:16:27,666 --> 01:16:32,342
has there been a cause
which could unite us as a species.

880
01:16:33,339 --> 01:16:35,683
Until now.

881
01:16:36,967 --> 01:16:38,969
You really hate mutants, don't you?

882
01:16:39,136 --> 01:16:42,481
On the contrary, I rather admire them.

883
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:43,732
The things they can do.

884
01:16:45,392 --> 01:16:48,362
I see mutants <i>as</i> our salvation.

885
01:16:48,521 --> 01:16:49,693
A common enemy.

886
01:16:50,523 --> 01:16:53,652
A common struggle
against the ultimate enemy.

887
01:16:54,318 --> 01:16:56,195
Extinction.

888
01:16:56,654 --> 01:16:57,774
I believe our new friends...

889
01:16:57,822 --> 01:17:00,200
are going to help us
usher in a new era, Bill.

890
01:17:00,366 --> 01:17:02,710
A new era of genuine...

891
01:17:02,868 --> 01:17:05,621
and long-lasting peace.

892
01:17:19,593 --> 01:17:23,018
<i>Attention, attention.
Transport departure in two hours.</i>

893
01:17:23,180 --> 01:17:27,185
<i>Repeat.
Transport departure in two hours.</i>

894
01:17:33,858 --> 01:17:36,202
When was the last time
you were down here?

895
01:17:36,360 --> 01:17:37,737
The last time we went looking for students.

896
01:17:38,028 --> 01:17:39,746
A lifetime ago.

897
01:17:45,619 --> 01:17:47,792
<i>Welcome, Professor.</i>

898
01:18:11,270 --> 01:18:13,489
Raven's wounded.
She won't be moving fast.

899
01:18:21,906 --> 01:18:24,250
These are muscles
I haven't stretched in a long time.

900
01:19:07,826 --> 01:19:08,827
Charles!

901
01:19:11,288 --> 01:19:12,380
Charles!

902
01:19:20,297 --> 01:19:23,096
Charles? It's all right.

903
01:19:25,678 --> 01:19:27,476
I'll go check the generator.

904
01:19:35,229 --> 01:19:36,822
It's not the machinery, is it?

905
01:19:37,648 --> 01:19:39,070
I can't do this. My mind...

906
01:19:39,191 --> 01:19:40,408
Yes, you can.

907
01:19:40,526 --> 01:19:42,324
- It won't take it.
- You're just a little rusty.

908
01:19:42,403 --> 01:19:44,872
You don't understand.
It's not a question of being rusty.

909
01:19:45,030 --> 01:19:46,830
I can flip the switches.
I can turn the knobs.

910
01:19:46,865 --> 01:19:50,495
But my power comes from here.
It comes from...

911
01:19:51,203 --> 01:19:52,876
And it's broken.

912
01:19:53,998 --> 01:19:55,921
I feel like one of my students.

913
01:19:56,208 --> 01:19:57,505
Helpless.

914
01:19:58,877 --> 01:20:00,237
It was a mistake coming down here.

915
01:20:00,254 --> 01:20:01,801
It was a mistake freeing Erik.

916
01:20:01,880 --> 01:20:04,258
This whole thing has been
one bloody mistake.

917
01:20:04,341 --> 01:20:06,844
I'm sorry, Logan,
but they sent back the wrong man.

918
01:20:07,678 --> 01:20:09,100
You're right.

919
01:20:10,431 --> 01:20:11,933
I am.

920
01:20:12,850 --> 01:20:14,352
Actually, it was supposed to be you.

921
01:20:15,394 --> 01:20:18,944
But I was the only one who could
physically make the trip.

922
01:20:21,066 --> 01:20:22,659
And I don't know
how long I've got here.

923
01:20:23,110 --> 01:20:25,909
But I do know that a long time ago...

924
01:20:26,530 --> 01:20:28,908
actually, a long time from now...

925
01:20:29,241 --> 01:20:32,415
I was your most helpless student.

926
01:20:32,870 --> 01:20:35,248
And you unlocked my mind.

927
01:20:35,414 --> 01:20:38,088
You showed me what I was.

928
01:20:38,250 --> 01:20:40,093
You showed me what I could be.

929
01:20:40,252 --> 01:20:42,254
I don't know how to do that for you.

930
01:20:42,421 --> 01:20:44,389
You're right. I don't.

931
01:20:46,258 --> 01:20:48,306
But I know someone who might.

932
01:20:50,429 --> 01:20:53,399
Look into my mind.

933
01:20:53,599 --> 01:20:57,194
You saw what I did to Cerebro.
You don't want me inside your head.

934
01:20:57,269 --> 01:20:58,361
There's no damage you can do...

935
01:20:58,437 --> 01:20:59,997
that hasn't already been done.
Trust me.

936
01:21:00,105 --> 01:21:01,106
Come on.

937
01:21:12,576 --> 01:21:13,623
Hey.

938
01:21:15,537 --> 01:21:16,584
Hey, Logan.

939
01:21:16,663 --> 01:21:17,664
Hi, Jean.

940
01:21:18,123 --> 01:21:19,215
Kill me.

941
01:21:19,291 --> 01:21:20,292
I love you.

942
01:21:23,587 --> 01:21:28,058
You poor, poor man.

943
01:21:28,133 --> 01:21:29,305
Look past me.

944
01:21:29,468 --> 01:21:31,311
No, I don't want your suffering.

945
01:21:31,470 --> 01:21:33,393
I don't want your future!

946
01:21:33,472 --> 01:21:35,600
Look past my future.

947
01:21:35,849 --> 01:21:37,977
Look for your future.

948
01:21:41,480 --> 01:21:42,823
That's it.

949
01:21:43,190 --> 01:21:44,442
That's it.

950
01:21:46,151 --> 01:21:47,494
That's it.

951
01:22:35,409 --> 01:22:37,377
Charles.

952
01:22:39,204 --> 01:22:40,581
Charles.

953
01:22:44,835 --> 01:22:47,213
So this is what becomes of us.

954
01:22:48,505 --> 01:22:50,348
Erik was right.

955
01:22:51,008 --> 01:22:53,227
Humanity does this to us.

956
01:22:53,385 --> 01:22:56,013
Not if we show them a better path.

957
01:22:56,930 --> 01:22:58,603
You still believe?

958
01:22:58,765 --> 01:23:01,234
Just because someone stumbles,
loses their way...

959
01:23:01,393 --> 01:23:04,237
it doesn't mean they're lost forever.

960
01:23:04,855 --> 01:23:08,610
Sometimes we all need a little help.

961
01:23:09,568 --> 01:23:11,241
I'm not the man I was.

962
01:23:13,405 --> 01:23:15,453
I open my mind...

963
01:23:16,033 --> 01:23:18,252
and it almost overwhelms me.

964
01:23:18,577 --> 01:23:22,081
You're afraid,
and Cerebro knows it.

965
01:23:23,248 --> 01:23:25,797
All those voices...

966
01:23:27,544 --> 01:23:32,220
so much pain.

967
01:23:32,591 --> 01:23:35,936
It's not their pain you're afraid of.

968
01:23:36,094 --> 01:23:38,096
It's yours, Charles.

969
01:23:39,389 --> 01:23:41,892
And <i>as</i> frightening <i>as</i> it may be...

970
01:23:42,059 --> 01:23:44,903
that pain will make you stronger.

971
01:23:45,229 --> 01:23:48,278
If you allow yourself to feel it...

972
01:23:48,440 --> 01:23:50,158
embrace it...

973
01:23:51,318 --> 01:23:55,494
it will make you more powerful
than you ever imagined.

974
01:23:55,656 --> 01:23:59,001
It's the greatest gift we have...

975
01:23:59,159 --> 01:24:03,005
to bear their pain without breaking.

976
01:24:03,163 --> 01:24:04,961
And it's born...

977
01:24:05,123 --> 01:24:07,501
from the most human power.

978
01:24:08,502 --> 01:24:10,095
Hope.

979
01:24:19,179 --> 01:24:21,523
Please, Charles...

980
01:24:21,682 --> 01:24:25,653
we need you to hope again.

981
01:24:33,944 --> 01:24:36,413
Find what you were looking for?

982
01:24:42,202 --> 01:24:43,499
The power's back on.

983
01:24:43,662 --> 01:24:44,959
Yes.

984
01:24:45,998 --> 01:24:47,716
Yes, it is.

985
01:26:28,058 --> 01:26:29,480
She's lost too much blood.

986
01:26:30,102 --> 01:26:31,445
She can't keep going like this.

987
01:26:31,603 --> 01:26:33,776
We have no choice, Bobby.

988
01:26:33,939 --> 01:26:35,282
- We can wake him up.
- No!

989
01:26:36,900 --> 01:26:38,152
They need more time.

990
01:26:38,735 --> 01:26:40,783
I had...

991
01:26:41,321 --> 01:26:43,323
a glimpse into the past.

992
01:26:43,490 --> 01:26:44,912
If we wake Logan now...

993
01:26:45,075 --> 01:26:48,454
we may set our fate
on an even darker course.

994
01:26:48,662 --> 01:26:50,460
They need more time.

995
01:27:09,808 --> 01:27:11,435
Raven, stop.

996
01:27:12,352 --> 01:27:13,979
Stop running.

997
01:27:14,312 --> 01:27:15,484
Charles?

998
01:27:17,524 --> 01:27:18,616
Where are you?

999
01:27:18,692 --> 01:27:19,909
Back at the house...

1000
01:27:19,985 --> 01:27:21,783
where you should be.

1001
01:27:21,945 --> 01:27:24,118
I need you to come home.

1002
01:27:24,823 --> 01:27:26,666
I know what I need to do.

1003
01:27:30,328 --> 01:27:31,545
If you kill Trask...

1004
01:27:31,621 --> 01:27:33,794
you will be creating countless more
just like him.

1005
01:27:34,458 --> 01:27:35,550
Then I'll kill them, too.

1006
01:27:35,667 --> 01:27:38,170
Those are Erik's words, not yours.

1007
01:27:41,840 --> 01:27:44,343
The girl I grew up with
wasn't capable of killing.

1008
01:27:44,468 --> 01:27:45,469
She was good...

1009
01:27:45,594 --> 01:27:48,188
fair, full of compassion.

1010
01:27:49,514 --> 01:27:51,266
I have compassion.

1011
01:27:51,349 --> 01:27:52,851
Just not for Trask.

1012
01:27:52,976 --> 01:27:54,649
He's murdered too many of us.

1013
01:27:58,523 --> 01:28:00,400
Shut her down, Charles. Get in her head.

1014
01:28:00,567 --> 01:28:02,035
She's not letting me in.

1015
01:28:02,194 --> 01:28:05,414
I'm barely holding on.
I'm not strong enough yet.

1016
01:28:13,538 --> 01:28:15,381
I know what Trask has done...

1017
01:28:15,749 --> 01:28:18,093
but killing him
will not bring them back.

1018
01:28:18,710 --> 01:28:19,830
It will set you on a path...

1019
01:28:19,878 --> 01:28:21,880
from which there is no return.

1020
01:28:22,589 --> 01:28:24,341
An endless cycle of killing.

1021
01:28:24,508 --> 01:28:28,229
Us and them, until there is nothing left.

1022
01:28:29,095 --> 01:28:33,100
But we can stop it,
right now, you and I.

1023
01:28:34,017 --> 01:28:37,112
You just have to come home.

1024
01:28:38,396 --> 01:28:40,194
I have to?

1025
01:28:40,565 --> 01:28:42,033
You haven't changed at all, Charles.

1026
01:28:43,360 --> 01:28:44,452
Like I said...

1027
01:28:44,569 --> 01:28:46,947
I know exactly what I have to do.

1028
01:29:02,254 --> 01:29:03,255
Where is she?

1029
01:29:03,421 --> 01:29:05,423
She's in an airport, boarding a plane.

1030
01:29:06,132 --> 01:29:07,600
A plane to where?

1031
01:29:10,554 --> 01:29:12,227
Washington, D.C.

1032
01:29:13,932 --> 01:29:17,527
Guys, there's something
I need to show you.

1033
01:29:19,938 --> 01:29:21,736
We're going backwards in time.

1034
01:29:21,898 --> 01:29:23,900
I set the system I designed...

1035
01:29:23,984 --> 01:29:26,362
to record any news about Paris
over all three networks...

1036
01:29:26,736 --> 01:29:27,828
and PBS.

1037
01:29:28,238 --> 01:29:29,785
All three? Wow.

1038
01:29:30,115 --> 01:29:31,788
Yeah, and PBS.

1039
01:29:32,784 --> 01:29:34,206
Look what I found.

1040
01:29:34,369 --> 01:29:37,529
Tomorrow, in front of the White House,
the President will make his announcement.

1041
01:29:37,789 --> 01:29:39,962
He will be joined
by Secretary of Defense Laird...

1042
01:29:40,125 --> 01:29:43,720
and has even sought the help
of renowned scientist Bolivar Trask...

1043
01:29:43,879 --> 01:29:47,383
his special advisor
to combat this mutant issue.

1044
01:29:47,549 --> 01:29:48,669
The White House has asked...

1045
01:29:48,717 --> 01:29:49,889
Raven doesn't realize...

1046
01:29:49,968 --> 01:29:51,848
that if she kills Trask
at an event like that...

1047
01:29:51,928 --> 01:29:54,306
with the whole world watching...

1048
01:29:55,098 --> 01:29:57,567
Then I came a long way for nothing.

1049
01:29:58,101 --> 01:30:00,069
And there's more bad news.
I saw in a report...

1050
01:30:00,645 --> 01:30:02,245
they found traces of her blood in Paris.

1051
01:30:02,480 --> 01:30:05,484
For all we know,
they already have her DNA...

1052
01:30:05,650 --> 01:30:06,776
which is all they'd need.

1053
01:30:06,860 --> 01:30:08,988
To create the Sentinels of the future.

1054
01:30:12,574 --> 01:30:14,576
There's a theory in quantum physics...

1055
01:30:14,659 --> 01:30:16,286
that time is immutable.

1056
01:30:16,494 --> 01:30:18,371
It's like a river.
You can throw a pebble into it...

1057
01:30:18,455 --> 01:30:21,755
and create a ripple, but the current
always corrects itself.

1058
01:30:22,667 --> 01:30:26,422
No matter what you do, the river
just keeps flowing in the same direction.

1059
01:30:26,838 --> 01:30:28,135
What are you trying to say?

1060
01:30:28,298 --> 01:30:30,175
What I'm saying is...

1061
01:30:30,342 --> 01:30:31,935
what if the war is inevitable?

1062
01:30:32,010 --> 01:30:34,433
What if she's meant to kill Trask?

1063
01:30:35,972 --> 01:30:38,521
What if this is just simply who she is?

1064
01:30:40,518 --> 01:30:44,523
Just because someone stumbles,
loses their way...

1065
01:30:44,689 --> 01:30:46,691
doesn't mean they're lost forever.

1066
01:30:51,529 --> 01:30:54,203
No, I don't believe that theory, Hank.

1067
01:30:55,116 --> 01:30:58,120
And I cannot believe
that is who she is.

1068
01:30:59,371 --> 01:31:00,497
Ready the plane.

1069
01:31:00,580 --> 01:31:03,003
We're going to Washington.

1070
01:32:20,994 --> 01:32:22,496
You all right?

1071
01:32:22,620 --> 01:32:23,667
Getting there.

1072
01:32:28,585 --> 01:32:31,259
Whatever happens today,
I need you to promise me something.

1073
01:32:32,130 --> 01:32:35,259
You've looked into my mind
and seen a lot of bad...

1074
01:32:36,134 --> 01:32:37,807
but you've seen the good, too.

1075
01:32:38,845 --> 01:32:40,518
The X-Men.

1076
01:32:41,765 --> 01:32:43,358
Promise me you'll find us.

1077
01:32:45,143 --> 01:32:47,145
Use your power, bring us together.

1078
01:32:47,771 --> 01:32:49,865
Guide us. Lead us.

1079
01:32:51,524 --> 01:32:54,323
Storm. Scott.

1080
01:32:56,488 --> 01:32:57,831
Jean.

1081
01:32:59,157 --> 01:33:01,330
Remember those names.

1082
01:33:02,327 --> 01:33:04,671
There are so many of us.

1083
01:33:05,330 --> 01:33:07,674
We will need you, Professor.

1084
01:33:10,627 --> 01:33:13,050
I'll do my best.

1085
01:33:13,213 --> 01:33:14,886
Your best is enough.

1086
01:33:16,800 --> 01:33:18,518
Trust me.

1087
01:33:42,492 --> 01:33:44,961
There's 12 carriers inbound, 10 miles!

1088
01:33:45,870 --> 01:33:46,962
They've found us.

1089
01:34:04,013 --> 01:34:06,141
Thousands of people
will be gathered here today.

1090
01:34:06,224 --> 01:34:07,646
They've come from all over the world...

1091
01:34:07,725 --> 01:34:10,569
to witness history,
along with news crews...

1092
01:34:10,728 --> 01:34:12,230
from at least 50 different countries.

1093
01:34:13,940 --> 01:34:15,283
Thank you.

1094
01:34:17,694 --> 01:34:19,094
Can I see your invitations, please?

1095
01:34:19,863 --> 01:34:21,115
Yes, you may.

1096
01:34:21,197 --> 01:34:22,323
These two are with me.

1097
01:34:22,407 --> 01:34:23,454
Go ahead.

1098
01:34:23,533 --> 01:34:24,659
Thank you.

1099
01:34:31,416 --> 01:34:32,793
Logan!

1100
01:34:32,917 --> 01:34:34,169
Please, this way, sir.

1101
01:35:01,279 --> 01:35:03,159
I haven't found her yet,
but she has to be here.

1102
01:35:03,281 --> 01:35:04,828
<i>The President of the United States.</i>

1103
01:35:27,805 --> 01:35:29,478
My fellow Americans...

1104
01:35:29,641 --> 01:35:34,317
today we face the gravest threat
in our history...

1105
01:35:34,479 --> 01:35:35,605
mutants.

1106
01:35:38,816 --> 01:35:41,194
We have prepared for this threat.

1107
01:35:44,197 --> 01:35:47,827
In the immortal words
of Robert Oppenheimer...

1108
01:35:47,992 --> 01:35:49,084
"Behold.

1109
01:35:49,661 --> 01:35:52,460
"The world will never be the same again."

1110
01:36:23,027 --> 01:36:24,028
Can I help you?

1111
01:36:27,365 --> 01:36:28,582
No, you can't.

1112
01:37:06,571 --> 01:37:07,788
Here they come.

1113
01:37:14,579 --> 01:37:16,252
<i>This is for you, brothers and sisters.</i>

1114
01:37:18,791 --> 01:37:19,917
Raven?

1115
01:37:22,628 --> 01:37:23,720
I have her.

1116
01:37:24,380 --> 01:37:25,597
Let me go, Charles.

1117
01:37:27,759 --> 01:37:29,227
There. You see?

1118
01:37:29,385 --> 01:37:30,477
Secret Serviceman.

1119
01:37:30,636 --> 01:37:31,762
Left of the stage.

1120
01:37:31,846 --> 01:37:32,938
- Got him.
- Go.

1121
01:37:53,785 --> 01:37:55,082
What the hell are you doing?

1122
01:37:55,161 --> 01:37:56,583
I didn't tell you to activate them.

1123
01:37:56,662 --> 01:37:57,834
I didn't.

1124
01:38:16,432 --> 01:38:18,309
<i>Raven, please, listen to me.</i>

1125
01:38:18,810 --> 01:38:22,940
<i>We've been given a second chance
to define who we are.</i>

1126
01:38:24,982 --> 01:38:26,359
<i>Don't do this.</i>

1127
01:38:29,779 --> 01:38:32,032
Gentlemen, you cannot pass this point.

1128
01:38:39,872 --> 01:38:41,624
We can't stop that many.

1129
01:38:41,791 --> 01:38:44,670
No, but we can slow them down.

1130
01:39:22,540 --> 01:39:24,213
Erik!

1131
01:40:09,045 --> 01:40:10,763
Storm!

1132
01:40:29,148 --> 01:40:30,570
Go, go, go!

1133
01:40:46,582 --> 01:40:47,674
Go, go, go!

1134
01:40:47,750 --> 01:40:49,127
Take us to DEFCON 3.

1135
01:40:49,293 --> 01:40:50,533
Mr. President, we are Code Red.

1136
01:40:50,586 --> 01:40:51,963
What's our air defense readiness?

1137
01:40:52,129 --> 01:40:53,381
All our air defenses are ready one.

1138
01:40:53,464 --> 01:40:54,886
What the hell happened out there?

1139
01:40:54,966 --> 01:40:56,058
I will fix it.

1140
01:40:56,133 --> 01:40:57,180
You said that before.

1141
01:40:57,301 --> 01:40:58,518
I wanted to make a statement.

1142
01:40:58,636 --> 01:41:01,435
Now the whole goddamn world
knows we can't protect them.

1143
01:41:01,514 --> 01:41:02,606
I will fix it.

1144
01:41:02,682 --> 01:41:04,480
You damn well better.

1145
01:42:15,921 --> 01:42:16,922
Charles!

1146
01:43:05,971 --> 01:43:07,723
Is everybody okay?

1147
01:43:41,590 --> 01:43:43,183
No!

1148
01:43:46,303 --> 01:43:47,350
Behind you.

1149
01:44:32,016 --> 01:44:33,359
Now!

1150
01:44:56,707 --> 01:44:59,256
I'm probably not supposed
to ask this kind of thing...

1151
01:44:59,752 --> 01:45:02,380
but in the future, do I make it?

1152
01:45:02,838 --> 01:45:04,181
No.

1153
01:45:05,883 --> 01:45:07,305
But we can change that.

1154
01:45:07,384 --> 01:45:08,931
Right?

1155
01:45:19,563 --> 01:45:21,190
Do what you were made for.

1156
01:45:30,407 --> 01:45:31,909
Where are you?

1157
01:45:49,260 --> 01:45:50,762
I got this! Go!

1158
01:46:33,470 --> 01:46:35,143
Oh, dear God, no.

1159
01:46:51,030 --> 01:46:53,283
So much for being a survivor.

1160
01:47:35,741 --> 01:47:37,038
One of them is in here.

1161
01:47:39,662 --> 01:47:41,414
No, no, no! Don't kill it!

1162
01:47:42,081 --> 01:47:43,173
I need it alive.

1163
01:47:56,595 --> 01:47:58,222
What the hell has happened?

1164
01:49:05,998 --> 01:49:08,217
You built these weapons to destroy us.

1165
01:49:09,168 --> 01:49:10,886
Why?

1166
01:49:14,465 --> 01:49:17,184
<i>Because you are afraid of our gifts.</i>

1167
01:49:18,135 --> 01:49:20,638
<i>Because we are different.</i>

1168
01:49:21,805 --> 01:49:25,150
<i>Humanity has always feared
that which is different.</i>

1169
01:49:25,809 --> 01:49:27,186
<i>Well, I am here to tell you...</i>

1170
01:49:27,394 --> 01:49:28,816
to tell the world...

1171
01:49:29,813 --> 01:49:31,986
you are right to fear us.

1172
01:49:32,357 --> 01:49:34,075
<i>We are the future.</i>

1173
01:49:34,818 --> 01:49:37,492
<i>We are the ones
who will inherit this earth.</i>

1174
01:49:37,738 --> 01:49:40,332
And anyone who stands in our way...

1175
01:49:40,491 --> 01:49:42,493
will suffer the same fate
as these men...

1176
01:49:42,659 --> 01:49:44,002
you see before you.

1177
01:49:51,210 --> 01:49:53,838
<i>Today was meant to be a display
of your power.</i>

1178
01:49:54,588 --> 01:49:56,682
Instead I give you a glimpse...

1179
01:49:56,840 --> 01:50:00,344
<i>of the devastation my race
can unleash upon yours.</i>

1180
01:50:09,561 --> 01:50:11,734
<i>Let this be a warning to the world.</i>

1181
01:50:12,439 --> 01:50:15,238
<i>And to my mutant
brothers and sisters out there...</i>

1182
01:50:16,026 --> 01:50:17,448
<i>I say this.</i>

1183
01:50:18,195 --> 01:50:19,868
<i>No more hiding.</i>

1184
01:50:20,030 --> 01:50:21,873
<i>No more suffering.</i>

1185
01:50:22,699 --> 01:50:25,077
You have lived in the shadows...

1186
01:50:25,244 --> 01:50:28,088
<i>in shame and fear for too long.
Come out.</i>

1187
01:50:29,331 --> 01:50:30,674
<i>Join me.</i>

1188
01:50:30,749 --> 01:50:34,253
<i>Fight together in a
brotherhood of our kind.</i>

1189
01:50:34,878 --> 01:50:36,551
A new tomorrow...

1190
01:50:37,756 --> 01:50:39,554
that starts today.

1191
01:50:46,765 --> 01:50:48,608
<i>All those years wasted...</i>

1192
01:50:48,767 --> 01:50:50,769
fighting each other, Charles.

1193
01:50:54,314 --> 01:50:57,944
To have a precious few of them back...

1194
01:51:36,690 --> 01:51:37,907
- Mr. President, sir.
- Stand down.

1195
01:51:37,983 --> 01:51:39,860
I said, stand down!

1196
01:51:41,695 --> 01:51:43,368
You want to make a statement?

1197
01:51:43,822 --> 01:51:45,620
Kill me. Fine.

1198
01:51:45,782 --> 01:51:47,705
But spare everyone else.

1199
01:52:00,339 --> 01:52:02,341
Very heroic, Mr. President...

1200
01:52:02,841 --> 01:52:04,343
but you had no intention...

1201
01:52:04,468 --> 01:52:06,687
of sparing any of us.

1202
01:52:07,137 --> 01:52:10,482
The future of our species begins now.

1203
01:52:46,009 --> 01:52:47,181
You used to be a better shot.

1204
01:52:47,261 --> 01:52:48,513
Trust me, I still am.

1205
01:53:02,359 --> 01:53:03,861
Get out of my head, Charles!

1206
01:53:04,027 --> 01:53:05,529
Raven.

1207
01:53:05,696 --> 01:53:07,573
Please, do not make us the enemy today.

1208
01:53:07,781 --> 01:53:09,624
Look around you.
We already are.

1209
01:53:10,117 --> 01:53:11,869
Not all of us.

1210
01:53:12,077 --> 01:53:14,330
All you've done so far...

1211
01:53:14,663 --> 01:53:16,665
is save the lives of these men.

1212
01:53:17,708 --> 01:53:20,257
You can show them a better path.

1213
01:53:23,922 --> 01:53:25,390
Shut her down, Charles.

1214
01:53:27,592 --> 01:53:31,222
I've been trying to control you
ever since the day we met...

1215
01:53:31,596 --> 01:53:33,598
and look where that's got us.

1216
01:53:35,726 --> 01:53:38,570
Everything that happens now...

1217
01:53:39,229 --> 01:53:41,402
is in your hands.

1218
01:53:45,444 --> 01:53:48,243
I have faith in you, Raven.

1219
01:55:26,920 --> 01:55:29,048
He's all yours, Charles.

1220
01:55:56,616 --> 01:55:59,244
If you let them have me,
I'm as good as dead.

1221
01:55:59,411 --> 01:56:00,788
You know that.

1222
01:56:01,455 --> 01:56:03,048
I know.

1223
01:56:05,041 --> 01:56:06,714
Goodbye, old friend.

1224
01:56:09,379 --> 01:56:11,222
Goodbye, Erik.

1225
01:56:44,623 --> 01:56:46,625
Are you sure you should let them go?

1226
01:56:47,584 --> 01:56:48,961
Yes.

1227
01:56:49,586 --> 01:56:51,304
I have hope for them.

1228
01:56:52,464 --> 01:56:56,469
There's going to be a time, Hank,
when we are all together.

1229
01:57:00,347 --> 01:57:02,315
What about Logan?

1230
01:58:17,924 --> 01:58:21,178
Buckminster Fuller is a
great example of an architect...

1231
01:58:21,261 --> 01:58:25,516
whose ideas were very similar
to those of a utopian future.

1232
01:58:31,855 --> 01:58:34,529
Good morning, Logan. Late start.

1233
01:58:44,618 --> 01:58:45,961
Have a good lunch.

1234
01:58:46,119 --> 01:58:47,371
Good job.

1235
01:58:47,704 --> 01:58:49,047
Very good job.

1236
01:58:49,914 --> 01:58:51,507
Storm.

1237
01:59:22,572 --> 01:59:23,664
Jean.

1238
01:59:25,075 --> 01:59:26,418
Hey, Logan.

1239
01:59:26,951 --> 01:59:28,077
Jean.

1240
01:59:28,787 --> 01:59:30,505
Are you okay?

1241
01:59:32,248 --> 01:59:33,670
You're here.

1242
01:59:34,292 --> 01:59:36,340
Where else would I be?

1243
01:59:38,630 --> 01:59:39,631
Whoa.

1244
01:59:40,465 --> 01:59:42,433
Easy, pal.

1245
01:59:43,968 --> 01:59:46,517
Well, some things never change.

1246
01:59:47,931 --> 01:59:49,524
It's good to see you, Scott.

1247
01:59:51,309 --> 01:59:52,561
Uh-huh.

1248
01:59:52,644 --> 01:59:53,816
See you later, Jean.

1249
01:59:57,941 --> 01:59:59,488
Professor.

1250
01:59:59,943 --> 02:00:02,742
Logan, is everything all right?

1251
02:00:06,116 --> 02:00:07,584
Yeah.

1252
02:00:08,618 --> 02:00:10,461
Yeah, I think it is.

1253
02:00:27,011 --> 02:00:28,228
You did it.

1254
02:00:28,304 --> 02:00:29,556
Did what?

1255
02:00:29,639 --> 02:00:31,641
Logan, don't you have a class to teach?

1256
02:00:32,308 --> 02:00:33,981
A <i>class</i> to teach?

1257
02:00:35,019 --> 02:00:36,111
History.

1258
02:00:36,813 --> 02:00:38,315
History?

1259
02:00:39,149 --> 02:00:40,829
Actually, I could use some help with that.

1260
02:00:41,317 --> 02:00:42,819
Help with what?

1261
02:00:42,986 --> 02:00:46,490
Pretty much everything after 1973.

1262
02:00:51,035 --> 02:00:54,084
I think the history I know
is a little different.

1263
02:00:55,707 --> 02:00:57,425
Welcome back.

1264
02:01:00,170 --> 02:01:01,843
It's good to see you, Charles.

1265
02:01:03,214 --> 02:01:05,057
It's good to see everyone.

1266
02:01:05,216 --> 02:01:06,718
Well...

1267
02:01:07,343 --> 02:01:09,516
I had a promise to keep.

1268
02:01:10,680 --> 02:01:13,934
You and I have
a lot of catching up to do.

1269
02:01:14,851 --> 02:01:16,353
Yeah.

1270
02:01:19,898 --> 02:01:22,026
What's the last thing you remember?

1271
02:01:27,113 --> 02:01:28,865
Drowning.

1272
02:01:37,123 --> 02:01:38,375
<i>The past.</i>

1273
02:01:39,876 --> 02:01:41,128
<i>A new...</i>

1274
02:01:41,211 --> 02:01:42,963
<i>and uncertain world.</i>

1275
02:01:54,390 --> 02:01:56,688
<i>A world of endless possibilities.</i>

1276
02:01:59,395 --> 02:02:01,568
<i>And infinite outcomes.</i>

1277
02:02:03,233 --> 02:02:04,359
You kidding me?

1278
02:02:04,484 --> 02:02:05,952
He's alive!

1279
02:02:10,323 --> 02:02:13,076
<i>Countless choices define our fate.</i>

1280
02:02:13,993 --> 02:02:16,462
<i>Each choice, each moment...</i>

1281
02:02:16,621 --> 02:02:19,249
<i>a ripple in the river of time.</i>

1282
02:02:19,415 --> 02:02:21,759
What do you want us to do with him,
Major Stryker?

1283
02:02:21,918 --> 02:02:23,670
<i>Enough ripples...</i>

1284
02:02:23,837 --> 02:02:26,431
<i>and you change the tide.</i>

1285
02:02:26,589 --> 02:02:27,681
I'll take him from here.

1286
02:02:27,841 --> 02:02:31,766
<i>For the future is never truly set.</i>

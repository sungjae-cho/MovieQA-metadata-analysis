1
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:37,000


2
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:57,549
<i>Hey. Aron here. Leave a message.</i>

3
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:00,632
<i>Hey, Aron. Sonja here, again.</i>

4
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:03,029
<i>I know that you're probably</i>
<i>gonna be away this weekend.</i>

5
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:06,396
<i>But listen, just think about</i>
<i>what we're gonna play. Please.</i>

6
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:09,472
<i>'Cause we have to decide,</i>
<i>and we really need to practice, okay?</i>

7
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,710
<i>Anyway, it will be fun. I promise.</i>

8
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,438
<i>And please call Mom. Please.</i>

9
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,080
<i>'Cause she worries,</i>
<i>which you know already.</i>

10
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,310
<i>Okay. Later, A. Bye.</i>

11
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:03,110
Hey! It's Friday night.

12
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,595
April 25, 2003.

13
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:10,114
I'm just entering Canyonlands.

14
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:13,715
Just me, the music and the night.

15
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,713
Love it!

16
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:40,596
Blue John Canyon.

17
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:44,070
Guidebook says four and a half hours
to the big-drop rappel.

18
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:47,270
I aim to take 45 minutes off that.

19
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,876
Your face.

20
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,235
You looked like a dog.

21
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:49,709
I wish I was hiking with anyone else.

22
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:57,595
I don't know. I think we go that way.

23
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,477
But we went that way,
and then we had to come back.

24
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,993
Hey!

25
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,591
You're doing Blue John too, huh?

26
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:07,672
No, actually.
We're headed for the dome.

27
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,637
- But I think we're lost.
- She's lost.

28
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,994
Hang on.

29
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,513
- Oh, my God.
- God.

30
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,950
Let's see this.

31
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,755
You are... here.

32
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,512
We are?

33
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:26,114
Yeah. I knew that. I knew that.

34
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:29,397
And the dome is there.

35
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,231
I can take you that way if you like.

36
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:39,513
I'm sorry. The <i>Friday the 13th</i> there.

37
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,033
Child-killer look.

38
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,517
I'm only a psychopath on weekdays.

39
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,192
And today's Saturday, so...

40
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,709
Can't take this off. It's my face.

41
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,233
Nice.

42
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:56,796
- Aron.
- Kristi.

43
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,235
Allow me to introduce you
to my friend Megan.

44
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,992
- Nice to meet you.
- It's an honor.

45
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:06,556
What do you say?
You're lost. I'm a guide.

46
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,873
I'm good.

47
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,438
- Why not?
- Sure.

48
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:14,750
All right. This way.

49
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,273
You biked from Horseshoe, huh?

50
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,033
What is that... like, 20 miles?

51
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:22,156
Seventeen on the odometer.

52
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,552
I thought it was 17.2.

53
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:26,953
17.3 actually.

54
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,956
You're one of those.

55
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,314
I'm not one of those.

56
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,516
Do you spend a lot of time out here?

57
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,591
It's my second home.

58
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,277
See? There's the fork right there.

59
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,512
Okay, totally missed that.

60
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,158
- Glad we bumped into you.
- Yeah.

61
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,151
What are the odds,
considering we're all the way out here?

62
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,629
Exactly. You go
to the one place in America...

63
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,234
you're pretty much guaranteed
not to run into a weirdo...

64
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,878
and what happens?

65
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,999
All right.

66
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:59,914
So the guidebook says
that the route's through here.

67
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:04,076
But I know a better way... the cool way.

68
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:09,598
Guaranteed best time you can have
with your clothes on.

69
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,513
Although it's better with your clothes off.

70
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,549
- It is a bit of a climb.
- We climb.

71
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,920
- And a bit of a squeeze.
- We squeeze.

72
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,832
So you get us all the way back in here...

73
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:29,593
and then you tell us
that you are not a guide.

74
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:33,309
Well, no. I'm an engineer.
But this is what I really want to do.

75
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,436
Oh, that's wonderful.

76
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:37,238
I've always wanted to be a supermodel...

77
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,959
but I don't think that's actually
really gonna work out, you know?

78
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,036
Jesus, what if these things move?

79
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,839
They've been here for millions of years.
They're not gonna move.

80
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,990
- Sure they will.
- What?

81
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,674
Yeah. Everything's moving all the time.

82
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,352
Let's just hope not today.

83
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,319
Great.

84
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,114
All right.

85
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,636
Now all you gotta remember
is that everything will be okay.

86
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,511
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

87
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:10,191
- What...
- Where... Aron!

88
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:12,919
Are you okay? Aron! Aron!

89
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,549
<i>Home on the train</i>

90
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:24,191
<i>Why'd you put my monkey on the train</i>

91
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,679
<i>As you arrived</i>

92
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,513
<i>My sleeping monkey is revived</i>

93
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:32,388
- Listen to the guy. He's fine.
- Yeah.

94
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,349
He's batshit.

95
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,317
You're batshit!

96
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:40,035
Come on! You gotta come down here!

97
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,758
Trust me!

98
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,910
Trust you? I'll kill you, Aron Ralston!

99
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,434
Oh, please. You love this.

100
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:03,071
Hey!

101
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,559
- Nice job!
- Oh, my God!

102
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:07,151
- Megan! You're missing it!
- Come on!

103
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,309
It's amazing!

104
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,753
- Fuck. Fuck.
- Just jump!

105
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:12,035
- Oh, my God. Fuck.
- Just jump, Megan!

106
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,712
Fuck.

107
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,552
Oh, shit!

108
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,673
Are you okay?

109
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,193
- Nice jump.
- Oh, my God.

110
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,554
I can't believe I just did that.

111
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:28,400
- That's why we have to do it again.
- Again? Again?

112
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,917
- Camera! Camera!
- Camera? Camera!

113
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,911
Camera!

114
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:52,148
So, Blue John is actually named
after this guy, Blue John...

115
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:56,028
who was Butch Cassidy's cook from
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.

116
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,075
That's cool.

117
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,878
- The Hole-in-the-Wall Gang.
- Yeah.

118
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:01,952
And they would hide out
in these canyons, I guess.

119
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:05,476
But also what they'd do is they'd run
horses... wild horses... into here...

120
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:07,357
and they'd trap 'em
at the end of the canyons.

121
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,237
- Wow.
- That's how they'd catch the horses.

122
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,230
Wow.

123
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,151
You wanna take
one more picture before I go?

124
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,468
- Yeah.
- Okay, cool.

125
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:14,834
Ready?

126
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:18,350
One, two, three.

127
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:20,476
Blue John. Blue Cheese.

128
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,437
Well, will I ever see you again?

129
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:24,431
That depends. Do you party?

130
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,834
Do I party? Yeah, sometimes.

131
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:31,071
Tomorrow night, we're actually seriously
throwing a party, if you wanna come.

132
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:33,230
Yeah. You should come by,
have a beer, kick back.

133
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,833
Okay. Where am I going?

134
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,797
It's about 20 miles away
near Green River.

135
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,791
You know the old motel? It's behind that.

136
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,235
There's gonna be a huge
inflatable Scooby-Doo.

137
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,753
- You can't miss it.
- Really? Okay.

138
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:43,795
- Yep.
- Cool.

139
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:44,790
Okay.

140
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,075
It was good to meet you. See ya!

141
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,230
Bye! Scooby-Doo!

142
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:51,193
Yeah!

143
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,713
Rock on!

144
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,117
You think he's actually gonna show up?

145
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,509
I don't think we figured in his day at all.

146
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,352
You liked him.

147
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:41,955
Shit!

148
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,952
This is insane!

149
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:02,112
Fuck.

150
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:08,874
Move this fucking rock!

151
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,190
Please.

152
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,433
Fuck.

153
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,752
Fucking save it.

154
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:02,477
Oh, God.

155
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,316
Kristi!

156
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,512
Megan!

157
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,991
Kristi!

158
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,513
It's Aron!

159
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,597
Megan!

160
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:36,155
Kristi! Megan!

161
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,191
Kristi!

162
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:58,798
Think.

163
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,633
Just think.

164
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:22,675
Ow!

165
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:41,713
Yeah.

166
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:55,073
Fuck.

167
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,997
Fuck.

168
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,752
Shit.

169
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,470
Oh, God.

170
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:19,629
Shit!

171
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,471
Fucker.

172
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,193
Come on. Please.

173
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:40,192
Sweet.

174
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,792
Nice and dull.

175
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,231
Look at the size of this one, man.

176
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,231
Like, how the fuck did this get here?

177
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:10,993
Yes.

178
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:21,988
Okay.

179
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,672
Hey!

180
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:16,713
Hey, buddy.

181
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,872
Here we go.

182
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:06,476
It's 3:05...

183
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:11,759
on Sunday, April 27, 2003.

184
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:16,155
This marks 24 hours...

185
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:20,233
of being stuck in Blue John Canyon...

186
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:24,710
right where it slots up before the big drop.

187
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,712
My name's Aron Ralston.

188
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:32,873
My parents are Donna and Larry Ralston
of Englewood, Colorado.

189
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:38,668
Whoever finds this can keep the recorder.

190
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:42,831
Just please try
and get in touch with my parents...

191
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:45,639
and give them this tape.

192
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:47,233
I'd appreciate it.

193
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:53,275
I was descending Blue John yesterday...

194
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:59,872
when this chock stone came loose...

195
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:01,439
and rolled onto my arm.

196
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:04,239
And now it's stuck.

197
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:09,870
The thumb is kind of this gray-blue color.

198
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:12,159
Yeah.

199
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:15,630
It's been without circulation for 24 hours.

200
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:19,751
So, I think it's pretty well gone.

201
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:23,750
I'm low on food.

202
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:29,835
That's about 300, 400 mil...

203
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:32,871
and that's it for water.

204
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:40,511
I'm in pretty deep doo-doo here.

205
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:46,592
Hello!

206
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:47,795
Please!

207
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:49,871
There's someone down here!

208
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:51,994
Help!

209
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:53,991
I'm in the canyon!

210
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:55,956
Help!

211
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:56,756
Help!

212
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,079
<i>Please!</i>

213
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:34,434
<i>Help!</i>

214
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:37,315
<i>Help!</i>

215
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:40,436
<i>Down here!</i>

216
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:41,839
<i>Help!</i>

217
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,672
Don't lose it.

218
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:03,919
Aron.

219
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:09,030
Do not lose it.

220
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:00,273
Not bad.

221
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:11,758
Oh, dinner.

222
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,998
<i>Tomorrow night, we're actually seriously</i>
<i>throwing a party, if you want to come.</i>

223
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,957
<i>You should come by,</i>
<i>have a beer, kick back.</i>

224
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:28,554
<i>There's gonna be</i>
<i>a huge inflatable Scooby-Doo.</i>

225
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,399
Scooby-Doo.

226
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:41,679
<i>Where are you</i>

227
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:54,319
Mountain Dew.

228
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:58,595
Plastic cup.

229
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:02,154
Thank you.

230
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:06,793
Might take a beer as well.

231
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,274
<i>Don't mind if I do.</i>

232
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:12,232
<i>Hey. Aron here. Leave a message.</i>

233
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,788
<i>Aron, it's Mom. I was hoping to catch you.</i>

234
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:22,633
<i>Are you there?</i>

235
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:24,392
<i>Hello?</i>

236
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:27,715
<i>Okay. Nothing urgent.</i>

237
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:31,960
<i>Dad's in New York,</i>
<i>so it'll be a quiet weekend.</i>

238
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:36,396
<i>Call me, okay? Lots of love.</i>

239
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:56,678
- Where you going?
- Don't know yet.

240
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:58,675
Right there, Brion.

241
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:01,479
Maybe Utah. Maybe somewhere else.

242
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:03,996
- Have a good one.
- Always do.

243
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:05,832
<i>Always do.</i>

244
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:33,240
Let's go.

245
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:13,794
Oh, come on!

246
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:44,594
Crap.

247
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:59,469
This is freaking me out, looking at myself.

248
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:02,476
Sorry. I hope that's okay.

249
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:08,512
It's Monday.

250
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:12,517
Bummer, all day.

251
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:16,080
I tried to set up this pulley all morning...

252
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:17,673
but it didn't work.

253
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:20,517
It was worth a try.

254
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:22,272
But there's too much friction.

255
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:26,433
And it's a climbing rope,
so there's too much stretch.

256
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:30,189
What I could really use
is about 20 meters...

257
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:33,909
of static wrap rope, 9.8 mil.

258
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:39,435
Three or four pulleys,
a rack of carabiners, a sling...

259
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:42,796
power drill... and bolt kit.

260
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:48,919
And eight burly men to do all the hauling.

261
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:53,191
That should just about do it.

262
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:57,993
I have...

263
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:02,679
about 150 milliliters of water left...

264
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:08,719
which should keep me alive
till tomorrow night...

265
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:11,678
if I'm lucky.

266
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:13,432
I peed twice.

267
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:17,713
Almost pissed my pants.

268
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:21,836
I don't know,
my body's acting really weird.

269
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:26,829
<i>The second time,</i>
<i>I did it in the CamelBak.</i>

270
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:32,631
<i>Smells really bad.</i>

271
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:35,757
But I'm sure it'll settle.

272
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:41,473
It's got to be chilled like sauvignon blanc.

273
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:47,476
No number twos.

274
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:50,233
Which should disappoint
my insect friends.

275
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:52,675
They'll just have to wait.

276
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:55,430
Let's see, what else could I tell you?

277
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:01,870
<i>There's this raven</i>
<i>that comes every morning.</i>

278
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:06,833
Hey.

279
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:09,354
<i>I clocked it at 8:17.</i>

280
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:14,111
<i>I'll film it for you tomorrow.</i>

281
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:17,795
Every morning at 9:30...

282
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:22,152
<i>I get 15 minutes of sunlight.</i>

283
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:23,719
<i>It's really nice.</i>

284
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:30,435
I have been chipping away.

285
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:34,149
<i>More to keep warm than anything.</i>

286
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:40,432
I'm beginning to think
that my hand is supporting the rock.

287
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:42,511
So when I chip away a little bit...

288
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:44,591
it actually settles more.

289
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:49,794
So...

290
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:54,271
I found this great tourniquet.

291
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:29,351
Oh, yeah. That hurts.

292
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:15,634
It hasn't been very useful.

293
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:20,914
Lesson:

294
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:25,949
Don't buy the
cheap, made-in-China multi-tool.

295
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:29,349
I tried to find my Swiss Army knife, but...

296
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:32,193
This thing came free with a flashlight.

297
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:35,158
The flashlight was a piece of shit too.

298
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:37,674
I kept it in my truck for emergencies.

299
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:41,192
Not that I'm blaming you, Mom.

300
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:46,671
It was a perfectly great stocking stuffer.

301
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:52,030
And there's no way
you could have ever known...

302
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:53,872
that I'd get in this kind of trouble.

303
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:57,388
<i>When we watch this later,</i>
<i>will the camera have to be on?</i>

304
00:45:57,480 --> 00:45:59,994
<i>Yeah. So you have to</i>
<i>leave the camera with us...</i>

305
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:02,275
<i>if we want to watch something</i>
<i>that you've made, right?</i>

306
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:03,998
- <i>Yeah.</i>
- <i>Good job, honey.</i>

307
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:07,356
- <i>Isn't that great?</i>
- <i>That is quite extraordinary.</i>

308
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:10,238
- So he's filming her now.
- Sounds beautiful, sweetheart.

309
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:12,754
- Yes.
- We're seeing it now live...

310
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:15,559
but he's going to be able
to show this again.

311
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:19,672
Go away.

312
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:24,837
To be able to watch it.
We can't just watch it with a...

313
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:28,117
So good.

314
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:31,669
<i>Well done. Okay.</i>

315
00:46:35,320 --> 00:46:37,470
Way to go, Sis.

316
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:40,595
- <i>Keep playing?</i>
- <i>Yes, honey. Keep going.</i>

317
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:31,312
Fuck.

318
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,956
Okay!

319
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:03,155
Go!

320
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:25,670
I love you.

321
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:04,033
So...

322
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,877
how do I get in?

323
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:12,513
<i>What's the...</i>

324
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:18,548
- <i>You know?</i>
- <i>Combination.</i>

325
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:19,789
<i>Combination.</i>

326
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:23,755
If I told you...

327
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:28,231
I'd have to kill you.

328
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:31,191
But already you kill me.

329
00:49:44,120 --> 00:49:45,553
Combination?

330
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:49,477
I think I have it.

331
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:03,593
Fuck!

332
00:50:11,640 --> 00:50:13,073
Fuck.

333
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:50,473
Fuck. Fuck.

334
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:42,598
Who's there?

335
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:52,034
Aron?

336
00:53:24,560 --> 00:53:25,231
Please!

337
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:28,276
Please!

338
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:41,112
Please!

339
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:52,791
<i>Good morning, everybody out there.</i>

340
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:53,949
<i>Good morning.</i>

341
00:53:54,040 --> 00:53:55,678
<i>It's</i> The Morning Show
<i>with Brian Stephenson...</i>

342
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:57,273
<i>Also coming up this half hour...</i>

343
00:53:57,360 --> 00:54:00,079
<i>Good morning. This will get you</i>
<i>going today. 90 for your high...</i>

344
00:54:01,880 --> 00:54:03,836
Good morning, everyone!

345
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:08,994
It is 7:00 here in Canyonlands, USA.

346
00:54:09,080 --> 00:54:11,674
And this morning on the boulder...

347
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:14,274
we have a very special guest...

348
00:54:14,360 --> 00:54:18,751
self-proclaimed American superhero...

349
00:54:18,840 --> 00:54:21,149
Aron Ralston!

350
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:23,151
Let's hear it for Aron!

351
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:25,914
Hey.

352
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,877
Hi. Oh, gosh.

353
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:31,157
It's a real pleasure to be here.
Thank you. Thank you.

354
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:35,153
Hey, can I say hi to my mom and dad?

355
00:54:35,240 --> 00:54:37,276
Mom and Dad!

356
00:54:37,360 --> 00:54:39,476
Mustn't forget Mom and Dad.
Right, Aron?

357
00:54:39,560 --> 00:54:41,516
Yeah. That's right.

358
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:43,477
Hey, Mom.

359
00:54:43,560 --> 00:54:45,278
I'm really sorry...

360
00:54:45,360 --> 00:54:47,954
I didn't answer the phone the other night.

361
00:54:48,040 --> 00:54:50,918
If I had, I would have told you
where I was going, and then...

362
00:54:52,560 --> 00:54:54,391
Well, I probably
wouldn't be here right now.

363
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:56,152
That's for sure!

364
00:54:56,240 --> 00:54:58,800
But like I always say...

365
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:01,519
your supreme selfishness...

366
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:03,511
is our gain.

367
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:06,910
Thank you, Aron.
Anyone else you'd like to say hi to?

368
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:09,472
- Well, Brion at work.
- Hi, Aron!

369
00:55:09,560 --> 00:55:11,039
Hey.

370
00:55:11,120 --> 00:55:13,236
I probably won't be making it
into work today.

371
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:17,794
Get a load of this guy! Oh, wait. Hold on.

372
00:55:18,520 --> 00:55:23,435
We've got a question coming in
from another Aron...

373
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:26,796
in Loser Canyon, Utah.

374
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:28,279
Aron asks...

375
00:55:28,360 --> 00:55:30,476
Am I right in thinking...

376
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:33,552
that even if Brion from work...

377
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:35,153
notifies the police...

378
00:55:35,240 --> 00:55:37,390
they'll put a 24-hour hold on it...

379
00:55:37,480 --> 00:55:40,597
before they file a Missing Persons report?

380
00:55:40,680 --> 00:55:44,639
Which means you won't become
officially missing...

381
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:48,679
until midday Wednesday, at the earliest!

382
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:51,829
Yeah. You're right
on the money there, Aron.

383
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:56,596
Which means
I'll probably be dead by then.

384
00:55:56,680 --> 00:56:00,195
Aron from Loser Canyon, Utah.
How do you know so much?

385
00:56:00,280 --> 00:56:02,748
Well, I'll tell you how I know so much.

386
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:06,832
I volunteer for the rescue service.

387
00:56:06,920 --> 00:56:09,036
You see, I'm something of a...

388
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:12,914
well, a big fucking hard hero.

389
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:17,633
And I can do everything
on my own, you see?

390
00:56:17,720 --> 00:56:20,188
I do see.

391
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:22,350
Now...

392
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:25,671
is it true that despite...

393
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:31,032
or maybe because
you're a big fucking hard hero...

394
00:56:31,120 --> 00:56:34,317
you didn't tell anyone
where you were going?

395
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:38,352
Yeah, that's absolutely correct.

396
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,230
- Anyone?
- Anyone.

397
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:48,992
Oops!

398
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:55,032
Oops.

399
00:57:03,160 --> 00:57:04,593
Oops.

400
00:57:14,080 --> 00:57:15,593
Mom, Dad.

401
00:57:18,600 --> 00:57:20,795
I just want to take this time to tell you...

402
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:24,395
that the times we've spent together
have been awesome.

403
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:28,515
And I haven't appreciated you
in my heart...

404
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:30,511
as I know that I could.

405
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:35,391
Mom, I love you...

406
00:57:35,480 --> 00:57:38,916
and I wish that I'd returned
all your calls, ever.

407
00:57:43,720 --> 00:57:45,551
I love you guys...

408
00:57:47,160 --> 00:57:49,390
and I'll always be with you.

409
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:56,392
Yeah.

410
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:28,873
Bone.

411
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:38,831
It's no Slurpee.

412
01:00:42,120 --> 01:00:43,680
It's like a bag of piss.

413
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:01,353
<i>Nice!</i>

414
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:18,393
<i>Come on, Ralston!</i>

415
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:20,835
<i>Okay, I'm gonna go up again.</i>

416
01:01:20,920 --> 01:01:22,751
<i>Give me that.</i>

417
01:01:22,840 --> 01:01:24,910
<i>Quick, while he's gone.</i>

418
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:26,718
- <i>Listen.</i>
- <i>We could tell him.</i>

419
01:01:26,800 --> 01:01:28,472
- <i>I know that.</i>
- <i>Okay? Tell him.</i>

420
01:01:28,560 --> 01:01:30,869
<i>We're very worried about you.</i>

421
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:32,837
- <i>We're worried.</i>
- <i>About your music.</i>

422
01:01:32,920 --> 01:01:34,717
<i>Your musical choices are really rough.</i>

423
01:01:34,800 --> 01:01:36,950
<i>If you keep singing Phish,</i>
<i>you're never gonna get a girlfriend.</i>

424
01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:37,631
<i>Never.</i>

425
01:01:37,720 --> 01:01:39,711
<i>You might have one,</i>
<i>but I doubt that you do.</i>

426
01:01:39,800 --> 01:01:42,712
- <i>You may be sort of cute, occasionally.</i>
- <i>I'm nervous and scared for you.</i>

427
01:01:42,800 --> 01:01:45,553
- <i>Okay. This cannonball's for you.</i>
- <i>No one will care.</i>

428
01:01:45,640 --> 01:01:47,278
<i>Okay.</i>

429
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:51,957
<i>That was a 10.</i>

430
01:01:52,040 --> 01:01:53,473
<i>All right.</i>

431
01:01:55,560 --> 01:01:58,028
<i>I'm going to test your theory...</i>

432
01:01:58,120 --> 01:02:00,350
<i>about whether or not it's better to do it...</i>

433
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:03,479
- <i>Oh, God!</i>
- <i>without your clothes on.</i>

434
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:07,111
<i>I'm just gonna swim for a bit.</i>

435
01:02:28,280 --> 01:02:30,510
Don't.

436
01:02:30,600 --> 01:02:32,431
No, no. Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't.

437
01:02:33,400 --> 01:02:34,515
Please.

438
01:02:36,360 --> 01:02:37,793
Don't.

439
01:02:39,320 --> 01:02:40,639
Don't.

440
01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:42,790
<i>Ralston, rock on.</i>

441
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:35,433
Oh, fuck.

442
01:04:33,480 --> 01:04:35,436
<i>You don't even want me here, do you?</i>

443
01:04:38,320 --> 01:04:40,231
I'm gonna go, Aron.

444
01:04:43,040 --> 01:04:44,951
<i>Is that what you want?</i>

445
01:04:48,080 --> 01:04:49,672
It is, isn't it?

446
01:04:53,800 --> 01:04:54,915
Okay.

447
01:04:57,280 --> 01:04:58,713
<i>Come back.</i>

448
01:05:02,640 --> 01:05:05,029
You're gonna be so Ionely, Aron.

449
01:05:20,600 --> 01:05:25,720
<i>46, 47, 48, 49, 50!</i>

450
01:05:25,800 --> 01:05:28,109
<i>You hear that, Aron? I'm coming!</i>

451
01:05:30,640 --> 01:05:32,870
I'm holding on.

452
01:05:35,320 --> 01:05:37,356
Time's moving really slowly.

453
01:05:38,840 --> 01:05:41,195
My heart's beating really fast.

454
01:05:41,280 --> 01:05:43,589
I swear to God, it feels like...

455
01:05:43,680 --> 01:05:44,635
It feels like...

456
01:05:44,720 --> 01:05:47,075
It's beating, like, three times
as fast as it should be.

457
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:54,433
So cold.

458
01:05:55,600 --> 01:05:57,033
So cold.

459
01:06:00,960 --> 01:06:02,439
Hey.

460
01:06:02,520 --> 01:06:03,919
Blue John.

461
01:06:08,720 --> 01:06:12,998
I... love... you.

462
01:06:13,080 --> 01:06:14,672
There you are.

463
01:06:15,760 --> 01:06:18,911
Rana. I've been thinking about you, girl.

464
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:20,797
<i>I've been thinking about you, girl.</i>

465
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:22,472
<i>I admit it. I admit it.</i>

466
01:06:26,520 --> 01:06:28,954
- <i>I know how I am.</i>
- <i>I tried to do everything.</i>

467
01:06:29,040 --> 01:06:31,110
- <i>Where I was.</i>
- <i>I tried.</i>

468
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:32,838
<i>Aron? Where are you?</i>

469
01:06:32,920 --> 01:06:34,797
<i>Where are you?</i>

470
01:06:46,600 --> 01:06:48,511
What are you guys doing here?

471
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:51,475
Eddie? Tom?

472
01:06:52,200 --> 01:06:54,156
Hey, you guys. What's going on?

473
01:06:55,320 --> 01:06:57,675
Eric? Hey.

474
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,230
You look like the Hole-in-the-Wall Gang.

475
01:07:05,320 --> 01:07:06,639
Dorks.

476
01:07:09,560 --> 01:07:11,471
Found you, Aron.

477
01:07:18,600 --> 01:07:22,070
<i>Sis, I'm sorry</i>
<i>that I won't be at your wedding.</i>

478
01:07:22,160 --> 01:07:25,675
<i>I know that I promised to play,</i>
<i>that we'd play.</i>

479
01:07:26,720 --> 01:07:28,233
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

480
01:07:28,320 --> 01:07:30,920
I know it'll be a good one.

481
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:35,073
8:15. There's no raven.

482
01:07:35,160 --> 01:07:37,390
8:20.

483
01:07:37,480 --> 01:07:39,232
8:30. My raven didn't come.

484
01:07:43,920 --> 01:07:46,070
I've been thinking.

485
01:07:46,160 --> 01:07:48,230
Everything is...

486
01:07:49,520 --> 01:07:52,159
- It just comes together.
- You're gonna be so Ionely, Aron.

487
01:07:52,240 --> 01:07:54,310
- Have a good one.
- Always do.

488
01:07:54,400 --> 01:07:55,549
Laters!

489
01:07:55,640 --> 01:07:58,359
- It's me.
- <i>Aron, it's Mom.</i>

490
01:07:58,440 --> 01:08:00,670
- <i>I was hoping to catch you.</i>
- I chose this.

491
01:08:00,760 --> 01:08:02,910
<i>Dad's in New York,</i>
<i>so it'll be a quiet weekend.</i>

492
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:04,149
I chose all of this.

493
01:08:04,240 --> 01:08:07,391
Call me, okay? Lots of love.

494
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:11,115
This rock.

495
01:08:12,680 --> 01:08:15,035
This rock has been waiting for me
my entire life.

496
01:08:15,120 --> 01:08:18,954
I hate this rock!

497
01:08:20,160 --> 01:08:21,957
- In its entire life...
- ever since it was...

498
01:08:22,040 --> 01:08:24,315
a bit of meteorite...

499
01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:25,958
a million billion years ago...

500
01:08:26,040 --> 01:08:27,632
How the fuck did this get here?

501
01:08:27,720 --> 01:08:29,119
Up there in space...

502
01:08:29,200 --> 01:08:30,952
it's been waiting...

503
01:08:31,920 --> 01:08:34,229
to come here...

504
01:08:34,320 --> 01:08:36,436
right... right here.

505
01:08:39,560 --> 01:08:41,710
I've been moving towards it my whole life.

506
01:08:41,800 --> 01:08:45,270
<i>The minute I was born,</i>
<i>every breath I've taken...</i>

507
01:08:45,360 --> 01:08:46,679
<i>every action...</i>

508
01:08:46,760 --> 01:08:49,752
<i>has been leading me to this crack...</i>

509
01:08:49,840 --> 01:08:51,910
<i>on the earth's surface.</i>

510
01:12:55,960 --> 01:12:57,951
Okay. Come on.

511
01:13:31,640 --> 01:13:33,232
Don't pass out.

512
01:14:51,400 --> 01:14:52,515
Don't fall asleep.

513
01:16:26,640 --> 01:16:28,073
Thank you.

514
01:18:31,600 --> 01:18:33,192
Easy.

515
01:18:38,560 --> 01:18:40,949
Easy. Come on.

516
01:21:57,640 --> 01:21:58,755
Help!

517
01:22:02,400 --> 01:22:03,992
Please!

518
01:22:05,080 --> 01:22:06,911
Help me!

519
01:22:11,960 --> 01:22:13,518
I need help!

520
01:22:25,520 --> 01:22:28,637
My name is Aron Ral... Aron Ralston.

521
01:22:28,720 --> 01:22:30,790
This Saturday I was trapped by a boulder.

522
01:22:30,880 --> 01:22:33,792
I haven't had food or water for five days.

523
01:22:33,880 --> 01:22:35,313
<i>This morning I cut my arm...</i>

524
01:22:35,400 --> 01:22:37,038
This morning I cut my arm off.

525
01:22:40,080 --> 01:22:41,991
Please. Some water?

526
01:22:44,480 --> 01:22:46,072
Thank you.

527
01:22:54,200 --> 01:22:57,670
- Do you have a phone?
- Yes, but no signal.

528
01:22:57,760 --> 01:23:00,433
You should stop and rest.

529
01:23:00,520 --> 01:23:02,590
No. I've gotta keep going.

530
01:23:03,800 --> 01:23:05,597
Can one of you run?

531
01:23:05,680 --> 01:23:07,910
Can one of you run ahead?

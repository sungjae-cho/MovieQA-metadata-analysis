00:00:47,081 --> 00:00:48,123
(TAPPING ON MIC)

3
00:00:48,207 --> 00:00:50,960
RICKY GERVAIS: Testing. Testing.

4
00:00:51,043 --> 00:00:56,507
Testing over the credits.
The credits that no one cares about.

5
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:58,300
"Ooh, we're the business people.

6
00:00:58,384 --> 00:01:02,346
"Ooh, we want our credit
before the film starts, 'cause..."

7
00:01:02,429 --> 00:01:03,639
Anyway.

8
00:01:03,722 --> 00:01:05,933
The story you're about to see
takes place in a world

9
00:01:06,016 --> 00:01:09,311
where the human race has never evolved
the ability to tell a lie.

10
00:01:09,395 --> 00:01:11,397
This is a typical town in that world.

11
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:16,026
As you can see, people have jobs and cars
and houses and families,

12
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:18,862
but everyone tells the absolute truth.

13
00:01:18,946 --> 00:01:22,700
There's no such thing
as deceit or flattery or fiction.

14
00:01:22,783 --> 00:01:24,910
People say exactly what they think,

15
00:01:24,994 --> 00:01:27,413
and sometimes that can come across
as a bit harsh.

16
00:01:27,496 --> 00:01:30,082
But they've got no choice in the matter.
It's their nature.

17
00:01:30,165 --> 00:01:32,042
Look, I'm not coming in to work today.

18
00:01:32,126 --> 00:01:34,461
No, I'm not sick. I just hate it there.

19
00:01:34,795 --> 00:01:38,215
Oh, your baby is so ugly. It's like a little rat.

20
00:01:38,841 --> 00:01:43,137
Wow! I just took one of the biggest poops
of my whole life.

21
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:44,305
What are you ordering?

22
00:01:44,388 --> 00:01:47,641
GERVAIS: So if you're a chubby,
little loser like this guy, for example,

23
00:01:47,725 --> 00:01:49,351
that's Mark Bellison, by the way,

24
00:01:49,435 --> 00:01:52,897
then you're all alone
and at the bottom of the pile.

25
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:56,191
But later on in the story,
his luck's gonna change

26
00:01:56,275 --> 00:01:58,485
when he tells the world's first lie.

27
00:01:58,569 --> 00:02:01,071
He doesn't even know it himself yet.

28
00:02:01,155 --> 00:02:03,282
So look forward to that.

29
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:08,996
(EXHALES)

30
00:02:13,417 --> 00:02:15,127
Don't blow this.

31
00:02:28,641 --> 00:02:30,142
- Hi!
- Hi.

32
00:02:30,226 --> 00:02:31,685
You're early.

33
00:02:31,769 --> 00:02:33,562
I was just masturbating.

34
00:02:33,646 --> 00:02:36,273
That makes me think of your vagina.

35
00:02:37,358 --> 00:02:40,110
I'm Mark. How are you?

36
00:02:40,194 --> 00:02:41,612
A little frustrated at the moment.

37
00:02:41,695 --> 00:02:45,824
Also, equally depressed and pessimistic
about our date tonight.

38
00:02:46,367 --> 00:02:47,451
Sure.

39
00:02:47,535 --> 00:02:49,453
I'm Anna. Come on in.

40
00:02:51,205 --> 00:02:53,999
Um... Just wait there.

41
00:02:54,708 --> 00:02:56,627
I need to finish getting ready.

42
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:58,546
While doing that,
I might realise I'm still horny

43
00:02:58,629 --> 00:03:00,589
and try to finish masturbating
without you hearing.

44
00:03:00,673 --> 00:03:02,091
(CHUCKLES)

45
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:15,020
I feel awkward now about being early.

46
00:03:15,104 --> 00:03:17,398
ANNA: Yeah,
I'm disappointed that you're early

47
00:03:17,481 --> 00:03:19,525
and not really looking forward
to tonight in general,

48
00:03:19,608 --> 00:03:21,610
but the thought of being alone
the rest of my life

49
00:03:21,694 --> 00:03:24,488
scares both my mother and me equally.

50
00:03:24,738 --> 00:03:25,948
Sure.

51
00:03:33,789 --> 00:03:35,124
Oh.

52
00:03:37,167 --> 00:03:42,923
I'm thinking you've started masturbating,
'cause it's like it's too quiet.

53
00:03:43,007 --> 00:03:47,011
And you said you were gonna
try and do it without me hearing.

54
00:03:50,014 --> 00:03:54,518
I'm worried the restaurant I've picked
isn't expensive enough for you.

55
00:03:55,686 --> 00:03:58,272
It's all I can afford

56
00:03:58,355 --> 00:04:00,065
in my situation.

57
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,027
I know I'm in my 40s,

58
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:06,572
but I haven't got any
financial assets to speak of.

59
00:04:07,489 --> 00:04:11,285
Also, my boss said
he's probably gonna fire me this week.

60
00:04:17,958 --> 00:04:19,210
Wow!

61
00:04:19,293 --> 00:04:20,711
I just masturbated.

62
00:04:20,794 --> 00:04:23,422
That makes me horny.
I hope this date ends in sex.

63
00:04:23,505 --> 00:04:24,757
I don't find you attractive.

64
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:25,925
Oh!

65
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:28,135
Shall we?

66
00:04:28,719 --> 00:04:29,887
Yeah.

67
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:32,014
- After you.
- Thanks.

68
00:04:33,224 --> 00:04:34,516
(SIGHS)

69
00:04:38,604 --> 00:04:41,815
- This is not as nice as I remember it.
- What are we gonna talk about?

70
00:04:41,899 --> 00:04:44,109
Hi. I'm threatened by you.

71
00:04:44,193 --> 00:04:46,987
Mark Bellison. Table for two.

72
00:04:47,071 --> 00:04:49,156
Of course. Come with me.

73
00:04:53,869 --> 00:04:55,579
MARK: Thank you.

74
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,498
Thank you.

75
00:04:58,249 --> 00:05:00,668
- Plastic.
- I'm very embarrassed I work here.

76
00:05:00,751 --> 00:05:02,127
- Hi.
- Hi.

77
00:05:02,211 --> 00:05:04,547
- Hello.
- And you're very pretty.

78
00:05:04,964 --> 00:05:06,006
That only makes this worse.

79
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:08,342
(CLEARS THROAT) Can I get
you two started on some drinks?

80
00:05:08,425 --> 00:05:10,302
- ANNA: Yes.
- I'll have a Budweiser, please.

81
00:05:10,386 --> 00:05:12,388
I'll have a mango margarita,

82
00:05:12,471 --> 00:05:16,016
and I'll probably have three more drinks
by the end of the night.

83
00:05:17,101 --> 00:05:18,519
- Your sister?
- No.

84
00:05:18,602 --> 00:05:20,229
- Daughter?
- No.

85
00:05:20,312 --> 00:05:21,438
She's way out of your league.

86
00:05:21,522 --> 00:05:22,565
(STAMMERS)

87
00:05:22,648 --> 00:05:24,066
Thank you.

88
00:05:31,323 --> 00:05:32,950
Shall I ask you
some questions about yourself?

89
00:05:33,033 --> 00:05:34,201
Yes.

90
00:05:34,702 --> 00:05:36,287
How do you spend your days?

91
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:37,538
I get up at 8:00 in the morning

92
00:05:37,621 --> 00:05:39,665
because the noise from my alarm clock
interrupts my sleep.

93
00:05:39,748 --> 00:05:42,585
And I lean over and just turn it off.

94
00:05:42,668 --> 00:05:44,920
Turn it off.
That's more specific than I thought.

95
00:05:45,004 --> 00:05:46,422
- Oh. What did you want to know?
- Just...

96
00:05:46,505 --> 00:05:49,550
- Well, do you have a job?
- I have a job in an office.

97
00:05:49,633 --> 00:05:50,926
- What do you do?
- I'm an executive.

98
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:52,136
- Do you enjoy that?
- No.

99
00:05:52,219 --> 00:05:54,263
- Oh!
- But I enjoy the end result of the job,

100
00:05:54,346 --> 00:05:55,890
which is money.

101
00:05:55,973 --> 00:05:58,767
And also the hours are pretty good
for the amount of money I make,

102
00:05:58,851 --> 00:06:02,730
which I spend on things I like,
such as clothes and hiking and drinking,

103
00:06:02,813 --> 00:06:04,732
even though I know it's bad for me.

104
00:06:04,815 --> 00:06:08,360
But I'd rather just get all the money
and not have to work for the results.

105
00:06:08,444 --> 00:06:09,820
Oh, sure.

106
00:06:10,779 --> 00:06:12,740
Tell me something about you, though.

107
00:06:12,823 --> 00:06:14,742
You already know a lot about me.

108
00:06:14,825 --> 00:06:18,495
You know I'm good-looking
because, well, here I am.

109
00:06:18,954 --> 00:06:20,497
And you know that I'm successful

110
00:06:20,581 --> 00:06:23,959
because you've seen my apartment
and the clothes that I'm wearing.

111
00:06:24,043 --> 00:06:27,296
And you know I'm happy because I'm smiling.

112
00:06:27,379 --> 00:06:29,590
- Are you always happy?
- Usually.

113
00:06:29,673 --> 00:06:32,676
Some days I stay in bed, eating and crying.

114
00:06:35,888 --> 00:06:37,264
- There you go.
- Thank you.

115
00:06:37,348 --> 00:06:41,435
- I had a little sip of this from right there, so...
- Okay.

116
00:06:42,436 --> 00:06:45,272
You guys ready to order
or do you need a moment?

117
00:06:45,356 --> 00:06:46,690
I'm good.

118
00:06:46,774 --> 00:06:50,361
Oh! I'll have the Caesar salad with chicken
because I think I'm fat,

119
00:06:50,444 --> 00:06:53,280
but I also think I deserve
something that tastes good.

120
00:06:53,364 --> 00:06:56,033
I'll have the fish tacos
'cause it's what I had last time I was here.

121
00:06:56,116 --> 00:06:57,785
It's all I know.

122
00:06:58,452 --> 00:07:00,829
Great. I'll get those two started.

123
00:07:00,913 --> 00:07:02,665
If I gave you my number, would you call me?

124
00:07:02,748 --> 00:07:03,874
No.

(CELL PHONE RINGING)

126
00:07:06,168 --> 00:07:07,878
Sorry. It's my mom.

127
00:07:07,962 --> 00:07:11,298
I think she's probably checking on the date.
It won't take long.

128
00:07:11,382 --> 00:07:12,633
Hello.

129
00:07:13,092 --> 00:07:14,927
Yes, I'm with him right now.

130
00:07:15,553 --> 00:07:19,098
No, not very attractive.
No, doesn't make much money.

131
00:07:19,473 --> 00:07:22,685
It's all right, though.
Seems nice. Kind of funny.

132
00:07:22,768 --> 00:07:24,186
A bit fat.

133
00:07:24,687 --> 00:07:28,315
Has a funny little snub nose.

134

(EXCLAIMS)

135
00:07:29,692 --> 00:07:33,237
Kind of like a frog in the facial area.

136
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,488
Yeah, but...

137
00:07:34,572 --> 00:07:36,699
No, I won't be sleeping with him tonight.

138
00:07:36,782 --> 00:07:39,118
No. Probably not even a kiss.

139
00:07:39,535 --> 00:07:42,454
Okay. You, too. Bye. Sorry about that.

140
00:07:42,538 --> 00:07:45,207
It's all right. Don't think twice.
How is your mum, all right?

141
00:07:45,291 --> 00:07:47,960
- She's all right...
- Great. That's...

142
00:07:53,924 --> 00:07:57,136
Thanks for going on this date with me.

143
00:07:57,595 --> 00:08:01,181
You're way out of my league,
and I know you only did it as a favour to Greg

144
00:08:01,265 --> 00:08:04,768
and I'll probably never
hear from you again, but...

145
00:08:05,144 --> 00:08:08,272
I had a better time than I thought I'd have.

146
00:08:08,731 --> 00:08:11,901
But I won't really know how I feel about you
till I'm a little less drunk.

147
00:08:11,984 --> 00:08:13,193
- Sure.
- Yeah.

148
00:08:13,277 --> 00:08:17,323
Well, call me tomorrow
if you still like me when you're sober.

149
00:08:17,823 --> 00:08:18,991
I might.

150
00:08:19,074 --> 00:08:21,535
Oh! Thank you for kissing me on the cheek.

151
00:08:21,619 --> 00:08:25,748
I know you didn't have to do...
You're very pretty! Good night!

152
00:08:28,584 --> 00:08:32,463
MAN: (ON TV)... first used
roughly 4,000 years ago on Celtic chariots,

153
00:08:32,546 --> 00:08:39,261
was, for the most part,
unchanged by man until the late 1800s.

154
00:08:41,013 --> 00:08:43,849
Hi, I'm Bob. I'm the spokesperson
for The Coca-Cola Company.

155
00:08:43,933 --> 00:08:46,393
I'm here today to ask you
to continue buying Coke.

156
00:08:46,477 --> 00:08:48,020
I'm sure it's the drink
you've been drinking for years

157
00:08:48,103 --> 00:08:49,647
and if you still enjoy it, well,
I'd like to remind you

158
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:51,190
to buy it again sometime soon.

159
00:08:51,941 --> 00:08:53,609
It's basically just brown sugar water.

160
00:08:53,692 --> 00:08:55,069
Haven't changed the ingredients much lately,

161
00:08:55,152 --> 00:08:57,196
so there's nothing new
I can tell you about that.

162
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:59,156
Changed the can around a little bit, though.

163
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,783
You can see the colours are different there,

164
00:09:00,866 --> 00:09:02,993
and we've added a polar bear,
so the kids like us.

165
00:09:03,077 --> 00:09:05,788
Coke's very high in sugar,
and like any high-calorie soda,

166
00:09:05,871 --> 00:09:09,333
it can lead to obesity in children and adults
who don't sustain a very healthy diet.

167
00:09:09,416 --> 00:09:12,086
And that's it. It's Coke.
It's very famous. Everyone knows it.

168
00:09:12,169 --> 00:09:15,631
I'm Bob. I work for Coke.
And I'm asking you to not stop buying Coke.

169
00:09:15,714 --> 00:09:17,007
That's all.

170
00:09:17,091 --> 00:09:18,133
(SLURPING)

171
00:09:19,009 --> 00:09:20,761
It's a bit sweet.

00:09:20,928 --> 00:09:22,012

- Hey, Mark. How's it going?
- Hi, Frank. Not too well.

176
00:09:45,035 --> 00:09:48,539
I went on a date last night with a girl
I've had a crush on for years,

177
00:09:48,622 --> 00:09:50,207
and she'll most likely never call me again.

178
00:09:50,291 --> 00:09:54,712
Oh, and I think I'm getting fired today.
How about you?

179
00:09:55,629 --> 00:09:58,757
Oh, I'm not too great, actually.

180
00:09:58,841 --> 00:10:00,467
I've been throwing up painkillers all night

181
00:10:00,551 --> 00:10:05,014
because I'm too afraid to take enough
to actually kill myself, so...

If I'm not dead, then sure.

- Good. That's settled, then.
- All right. Have a nice day.

None of this is natural! We're all animals!

Why am I wearing clothes?
How do you people live like this?

189

Why is there all this concrete?

190
00:10:46,055 --> 00:10:48,766
I woke up this morning and realised,
not only do I not love you,

191
00:10:48,849 --> 00:10:51,352
but also the thought
of sleeping with you sickens me.

192
00:10:51,435 --> 00:10:54,146
That should make me not love you,
but it only makes me love you more.

All of Lecture Films' productions are written,
filmed and edited on this very lot.

196
00:11:17,211 --> 00:11:21,173
In fact, this building is
where Lecture Films' talented writers

197
00:11:21,257 --> 00:11:25,135
scour the world's past events
for the most dramatic,

198
00:11:25,219 --> 00:11:28,722
entertaining and even hilarious moments
from world history,

199
00:11:28,806 --> 00:11:32,893
which are then turned into scripts,
handed over to our world-famous readers

200
00:11:32,977 --> 00:11:37,189
to read off of teleprompters
and then filmed for your viewing pleasure.

of Lecture Films'
upcoming summer blockbuster,

203
00:11:43,904 --> 00:11:47,575

screenplay by Brad Kessler
and starring Nathan Goldfrappe,

206
00:11:55,457 --> 00:11:59,086
Napoleon: 1812 to 1813.

207
00:11:59,169 --> 00:12:03,007
And so Napoleon invaded Russia

208
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:07,219
with a brute force
of nearly 700,000 men behind him,

209
00:12:07,303 --> 00:12:11,807
armed with muskets
and supported by cannon brigades.

210
00:12:11,891 --> 00:12:14,810
Crippled by disease and hunger,

211
00:12:14,894 --> 00:12:17,771
Napoleon's men persevered.

212
00:12:17,855 --> 00:12:19,648

There's Mark Bellison,
one of Lecture Films' very own screenwriters.

215
00:12:24,486 --> 00:12:27,990
Mark is one of Lecture Films'
least successful screenwriters.

216
00:12:28,073 --> 00:12:30,701

getting fired today.

Morning, Shelley.

00:12:52,056 --> 00:12:53,098
Hi, Mark.

223
00:12:53,182 --> 00:12:56,393
I realise more and more every day
how overqualified I am for this position

224
00:12:56,477 --> 00:12:59,230
and how incompetent you are at yours.

225
00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:00,814
Any messages?

226
00:13:00,898 --> 00:13:04,526
Anthony is coming up within the hour to see
if he can get up the courage to fire you.

227
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:07,363
If he can't, he said
that he'll definitely do it tomorrow.

228
00:13:07,446 --> 00:13:09,865
Anything else?
Any messages not to do with being fired?

229
00:13:09,949 --> 00:13:11,825
Well, I told everyone
you're getting fired this week

230
00:13:11,909 --> 00:13:13,452
and they shouldn't expect
their calls returned,

231
00:13:13,536 --> 00:13:14,912
so no one left any messages.

232
00:13:14,995 --> 00:13:16,789
Okay. Next time...

233
00:13:16,872 --> 00:13:18,624
I don't think there'll be a next time.

234
00:13:18,707 --> 00:13:20,751
...take the message,
just in case I don't get fired.

235
00:13:20,834 --> 00:13:22,002
You're almost definitely getting fired.

236
00:13:22,086 --> 00:13:24,421
Yeah, but I'm still here now, so...

237
00:13:24,505 --> 00:13:25,798
Seems like a waste of time.

238
00:13:25,881 --> 00:13:26,966
No, it's not.

239
00:13:27,049 --> 00:13:30,719
You're getting paid for it, so let's
take the message in case I don't get...

240
00:13:30,803 --> 00:13:32,721
- But everyone knows that you are.
- Hasn't happened yet.

241
00:13:32,805 --> 00:13:35,349

- Oh, Mark.

The 1300s, they're so boring.

252

And the last two scripts
you turned in were depressing.

253
00:14:36,076 --> 00:14:37,536
They were about the Black Plague.

have happened in the 1300s.

"Will he fire me, won't he fire me?"

while I did enjoy your company,

it was based on your looks.

that I worked for you.

287
00:16:20,306 --> 00:16:21,891

"Fatty, fat faggot."

in front of an officer of the law.

516
00:28:08,847 --> 00:28:12,059

'cause that'll make me puke more.

Hello, Officer. How are you?

518

Well, I'm relieved
you're not a couple of black guys.

519

There's a much higher probability
that I'd be jumpy,

520
00:28:21,277 --> 00:28:24,071
shoot you without provocation,
and then I could lose my weapon.

and operating this motor vehicle?

524
00:28:30,411 --> 00:28:32,955
- Yeah, a lot of drink.
- Well, then you're probably going to jail.

525
00:28:33,038 --> 00:28:34,415
I'm gonna need you
to breathe into this for me.

526
00:28:34,498 --> 00:28:36,000
Officer, you don't need to do that.

527
00:28:36,083 --> 00:28:38,335
I'm gonna say that,
judging by the look of this car,

528
00:28:38,419 --> 00:28:39,712

530
00:28:41,505 --> 00:28:42,756
5,400.

531
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:44,383
That's a lot.

532
00:28:44,466 --> 00:28:46,844
That's too much, I think. Why so high?

533
00:28:46,927 --> 00:28:49,388
I have an expensive cocaine habit.

534

But, you know, it's more than that.

535
00:28:51,515 --> 00:28:56,228
I feel like when I set the price up higher,
it takes it out of the realm of petty crime

536
00:28:56,312 --> 00:28:58,147
and helps me preserve
my sense of personal integrity.

537

- I don't want to.

one more time.

- Might as well.
- I can't.

00:37:26,488 --> 00:37:27,698
Bye!

680
00:37:27,781 --> 00:37:29,200
Hang up, Mark.

681
00:37:29,283 --> 00:37:30,326
Bye.

682
00:37:35,581 --> 00:37:38,459
MALE NARRATOR: Proudly presents
The Industrial Revolution.

683
00:37:38,542 --> 00:37:41,503
Hello, I'm Angelo Badsmith.

684
00:37:41,587 --> 00:37:44,548
Come, watch me read
about the exciting events

685
00:37:44,632 --> 00:37:47,343
that took place during
the Industrial Revolution,

686
00:37:47,426 --> 00:37:52,223
written by the most beloved and esteemed
screenwriter of his generation,

687
00:37:52,306 --> 00:37:54,016
Brad Kessler.

688
00:37:54,099 --> 00:37:58,562
I don't think anyone can write
a better screenplay than Brad Kessler.

689
00:38:03,275 --> 00:38:04,318
No?

690
00:38:29,218 --> 00:38:30,594
BRAD: Hey!

691
00:38:30,678 --> 00:38:33,138
Did you come to beg for your job back?

692
00:38:33,222 --> 00:38:34,431
Everybody!

693
00:38:34,515 --> 00:38:36,225
That's the loser that thought
the Black Plague

694
00:38:36,308 --> 00:38:37,601
would make an interesting film.

695
00:38:37,685 --> 00:38:39,895
Hey! Good luck, douche bag.

696
00:38:42,439 --> 00:38:44,775
- You can't go in there.
- I've got an appointment.

697
00:38:44,859 --> 00:38:46,735
Oh, then go right in.

698
00:38:47,903 --> 00:38:49,864
Talk to you later.

699
00:38:50,906 --> 00:38:53,534
Hi. That was the head of the studio.

700
00:38:56,203 --> 00:38:58,289
Why are you here?

701
00:38:58,372 --> 00:39:03,294
Well, when you fired me,
I was seriously depressed.

702
00:39:04,003 --> 00:39:05,754
- I knew it.
- But...

703
00:39:06,297 --> 00:39:09,383
I went for a walk, right out of town.

704
00:39:09,466 --> 00:39:14,179
And I came across a desert,
and I fell asleep under a tree, palm tree.

705
00:39:14,263 --> 00:39:17,725
I don't do well
with other people's life-changing stories.

706
00:39:17,808 --> 00:39:22,104
And then when I woke up,
I saw like a thing sticking out of the sand.

707
00:39:22,188 --> 00:39:26,817
And I unearthed it,
and it was an ancient chest.

708
00:39:26,901 --> 00:39:29,278
Really old. Seven hundred years old.

709
00:39:29,361 --> 00:39:33,199
And in that chest was this.

710
00:39:33,282 --> 00:39:34,366
What is it?

711
00:39:34,450 --> 00:39:37,745
It's a never-before-heard event from history.

712
00:39:38,495 --> 00:39:40,206
When does it take place?

713
00:39:40,289 --> 00:39:41,415
1300s.

714
00:39:41,498 --> 00:39:42,917
Oh, come on, no, Mark!

715
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,837
Mark, I've already told you,
we don't do Black Plague movies here!

716
00:39:46,921 --> 00:39:50,925
It's not about the Black Plague!
It's not just about the Black Plague.

717
00:39:51,008 --> 00:39:53,969
It's about... Can I just read it, please?

718
00:39:54,678 --> 00:39:57,306
Get excited. Don't tap, get excited.

719
00:39:57,389 --> 00:39:58,766
Get very excited,

720
00:39:58,849 --> 00:40:05,356
because this is one of the best discoveries

721
00:40:05,439 --> 00:40:08,609
man has ever discovered.

722
00:40:08,692 --> 00:40:09,944
And you can be part of it.

723
00:40:10,027 --> 00:40:12,655
Yes, but is there a movie there?

724
00:40:12,738 --> 00:40:16,367
The greatest movie
Lecture Films has ever made.

725
00:40:18,285 --> 00:40:19,870
Start reading.

726
00:40:22,039 --> 00:40:27,586
"On the very first day of the 14th century,
a momentous occasion occurred.

727
00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:33,467
"It began like any other day.
The sun rose, babies began to cry.

728
00:40:33,551 --> 00:40:36,971
"But all of that was interrupted
when a giant, flying spaceship

729
00:40:37,054 --> 00:40:41,892
"crashed down from the skies
and landed in the heart of Babylon."

730
00:40:41,976 --> 00:40:43,018
What?

731
00:40:47,022 --> 00:40:50,734
Uh... Get everyone in here, right now.
We got a big one.

732
00:40:50,818 --> 00:40:52,987
Oh, please, Mark, continue.

733
00:40:56,615 --> 00:40:59,743
MARK: " The ninja army
unleashed a giant fireball

734
00:40:59,827 --> 00:41:03,831
"and brought the robot dinosaur
to its knees, saving Mars, Earth

"Jebediah and Aleena were allowed to marry
by alien King Wanglor.

00:41:14,884 --> 00:41:18,512
"It was to be the first human
nude Amazonian alien woman wedding,

739
00:41:18,596 --> 00:41:20,806
"and no expense would be spared.

740
00:41:20,890 --> 00:41:24,268
"All of Babylon and Mars were invited
to join the celebrations.

741
00:41:24,351 --> 00:41:27,062
"The wedding was held
on a brisk summer's day on Mars.

742

"And all of the survivors

"King Wanglor performed
a mind-wipe on all the humans,

"thereby erasing all knowledge
of these events for about 700 years,

748
00:41:44,496 --> 00:41:48,042
"until one day,
a great writer by the name of Mark Bellison

749

"would stumble across them in the desert
after being fired by his crap boss, Anthony,

"and mocked by Brad and Shelley,
two huge douche bags.

"Lecture Films would go on to make
the picture, and it'd be a huge success.

"And Mark would become very wealthy
and famous from it."

753
00:42:22,076 --> 00:42:24,662
What are you gonna call this, Mark?

754
00:42:26,956 --> 00:42:28,082
The Black Plague.

(ALL EXCLAIMING)

756
00:42:31,877 --> 00:42:34,338
I want you to start immediately
'cause I think this could be

757
00:42:34,421 --> 00:42:36,590
the best screenplay ever written.

758
00:42:36,674 --> 00:42:38,384
Oh, it will.

759
00:42:38,467 --> 00:42:42,888
It will be the best screenplay
ever written by anyone.

760
00:42:52,439 --> 00:42:53,732
Well...

761
00:42:54,942 --> 00:42:57,444
I guess congratulations
on selling your script today.

762
00:42:57,528 --> 00:42:59,655
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

763
00:43:01,866 --> 00:43:05,035
Tell me something about your family.
I don't know that much about you.

764

(MARK EXHALES)

765
00:43:06,453 --> 00:43:09,248
We're sort of what you'd call unlucky.

766
00:43:09,331 --> 00:43:10,708
My dad was an alcoholic.

767
00:43:10,791 --> 00:43:12,001
Sad.

768
00:43:12,084 --> 00:43:16,171
Drinking got to a point where he lost his job,
and with a family to support,

769
00:43:16,255 --> 00:43:18,299
he had no choice
but to turn to a life of crime.

770
00:43:18,382 --> 00:43:19,967
What kind of crime?

771
00:43:20,050 --> 00:43:22,970
Burglary. Houses, mainly.

772
00:43:30,311 --> 00:43:31,395
What are you doing here?

773
00:43:31,478 --> 00:43:33,439
It's Monday at noon.
You're not supposed to be at home now.

774
00:43:33,522 --> 00:43:35,524
If you must know,
I'm incredibly stressed at work.

775
00:43:35,608 --> 00:43:37,651
I've come home early.
I'm having a bit of me time.

776
00:43:37,735 --> 00:43:39,153
More importantly, what are you doing?

777
00:43:39,236 --> 00:43:40,905
Well, I was gonna rob your house.

778
00:43:40,988 --> 00:43:42,323
I don't like that idea. Not a fan of that at all.

779
00:43:42,406 --> 00:43:44,200
Well, I'm not gonna do it now
because you're in.

780
00:43:44,283 --> 00:43:45,367
And do you know what's gonna happen?

781
00:43:45,451 --> 00:43:46,952
I'm gonna call the police,
you're gonna be arrested.

782
00:43:47,036 --> 00:43:48,704
Well, I'm just gonna leave,
and you don't know my name.

783
00:43:48,787 --> 00:43:50,122
- What is your name?
- Richard Bellison.

784
00:43:50,206 --> 00:43:51,624
(LAUGHING) Good to meet you.

785
00:43:51,707 --> 00:43:54,752
You've got two options. Option one,
I send the police to your house, right?

786
00:43:54,835 --> 00:43:57,171
Arrest you there,
embarrass you in front of your neighbours.

787
00:43:57,254 --> 00:43:59,715
Or option two, you just come in
and wait for the police here.

788
00:43:59,798 --> 00:44:01,967
- No, I'll wait.
- Yeah?

789
00:44:02,051 --> 00:44:04,511
- Come on in then. Do you want a cup of tea?
- Yeah, that'd be great.

790
00:44:04,595 --> 00:44:06,764
MARK: He spent the last years
of his life in jail.

791
00:44:07,431 --> 00:44:08,766
I never really knew him.

792
00:44:08,849 --> 00:44:13,020
But I've been blessed
with some luck as well in my life.

793
00:44:13,103 --> 00:44:14,897
I had a wonderful mother who raised me.

794
00:44:14,980 --> 00:44:17,691
- Oh, that's sweet.
- She's great.

795
00:44:17,775 --> 00:44:18,817
Where is she?

796
00:44:18,901 --> 00:44:20,945
At an old people's home.

797
00:44:21,570 --> 00:44:24,865
But I'm gonna get her out of there tomorrow.

798
00:44:25,908 --> 00:44:26,992
I'm gonna get her a mansion,

799
00:44:27,076 --> 00:44:28,994
so she can spend
the rest of her life in luxury.

800
00:44:29,078 --> 00:44:30,579
That's nice.

801
00:44:31,997 --> 00:44:34,124
- Compliments from the chef.
- Thank you.

802
00:44:34,208 --> 00:44:36,627
I don't know what's wrong with him today,
but these just look awful.

803
00:44:36,710 --> 00:44:37,795
They look fine to me.

804
00:44:37,878 --> 00:44:39,755
Well, you're stupid.

805
00:44:45,803 --> 00:44:47,012
I was thinking.

806
00:44:47,096 --> 00:44:51,225
Now I'm obviously rich and successful and...

807
00:44:51,308 --> 00:44:58,399
Maybe I'm in your league
and that we could be together, romantically.

808
00:44:59,441 --> 00:45:01,485
What would be the point?

809
00:45:03,195 --> 00:45:04,947
We might enjoy it.

810
00:45:07,825 --> 00:45:11,704
Well, I do like you
and I do enjoy your company.

811
00:45:11,787 --> 00:45:13,664
And if we were to get together and procreate,

812
00:45:13,747 --> 00:45:16,834
I would like the offspring
that are carrying half my genetic code

813
00:45:16,917 --> 00:45:20,462
to be well taken care of, financially stable.

814
00:45:20,546 --> 00:45:24,258
I also think you'd make a good father
and a good husband, which I like.

815
00:45:24,341 --> 00:45:25,718
Fantastic.

816
00:45:26,927 --> 00:45:29,013
Unfortunately, none of that changes the fact

817
00:45:29,096 --> 00:45:33,642
that you'd still be contributing
half the genetic code to our children.

818
00:45:36,145 --> 00:45:39,690
I don't want little fat kids with snub noses.

819
00:45:41,483 --> 00:45:42,693

825
00:45:56,957 --> 00:45:59,668
They just called me. What's going on?

826
00:46:00,044 --> 00:46:03,631
They said I'm probably gonna die tonight.

00:46:03,714 --> 00:46:04,924
What?

Hello, there.
I was just coming in to check on her.

You must be Martha's son.

830
00:46:08,636 --> 00:46:09,845
What do you mean, she's gonna die tonight?

831
00:46:09,929 --> 00:46:12,806
It does not look very good.
She suffered a major heart attack.

832
00:46:12,890 --> 00:46:16,685
Her heart is very weak.
Her pulse is not very strong.

833
00:46:16,769 --> 00:46:19,647
Her blood pressure is dropping rapidly,

834
00:46:19,730 --> 00:46:24,652
and she will probably suffer
a fatal heart attack sometime tonight.

835
00:46:24,735 --> 00:46:27,821
Yes. Still going to die.

but death is a horrible thing.

00:47:15,244 --> 00:47:18,038

- Yeah, please.

Are you happier, at least?

1363
01:18:41,755 --> 01:18:44,133

- Very happy.

Have you found someone yet?

1365
01:18:46,760 --> 01:18:49,388
- Uh, no, I kind of gave up on that.
- Why?

1366
01:18:49,471 --> 01:18:54,476
Well, because I was thinking
that if I get eternal happiness when I die,

1367
01:18:54,935 --> 01:18:58,439
that'll be really great because it's eternal,

1368
01:18:58,522 --> 01:19:00,524
you know, so you can't really beat that.

1369

So I'm just really happy
that that's gonna happen.

1370
01:19:02,985 --> 01:19:05,946

I'm just gonna stick with the alcohol

hang out by myself and drink and watch TV.

That sounds like a long, miserable one.

1373
01:19:16,123 --> 01:19:20,127

because the more I drink, the faster I'll die.

"Why are you speaking to that idiot?"

"I'll give him a chance..."

1387

It means just because
he's talking to the man in the sky

1388

doesn't make him good enough
to be your friend.

chose to speak through,

01:30:52,069 --> 01:30:54,738
Well, now, it's not up to us
to decide what we get in life.

1520
01:30:54,822 --> 01:30:58,450
- That's up to the man in the sky.
- I'm talking to her.

1521
01:30:59,535 --> 01:31:02,663
Why don't you just ask the man in the sky
what he wants for Anna?

1522
01:31:02,746 --> 01:31:05,457
- Surely he knows best.
- She knows what's best.

1523
01:31:05,541 --> 01:31:07,668
Just tell her
what the man in the sky wants, Mark.

1524
01:31:07,751 --> 01:31:11,672
Why don't you tell me
what the man in the sky wants for us, Mark?

1525
01:31:11,755 --> 01:31:13,632
Just please tell me.

1527
01:31:16,427 --> 01:31:17,553

1530
01:31:33,360 --> 01:31:34,403
Are we married yet?

1531
01:31:34,486 --> 01:31:37,114
- Because I have plans later.
- There's a few...

1532
01:32:02,806 --> 01:32:04,517
ANNA: Mark, wait!

1533
01:32:06,310 --> 01:32:10,105
Why don't you just tell me
what the man in the sky wants?

1534
01:32:11,398 --> 01:32:13,234
- I did a bad thing.
- It's okay.

1535
01:32:13,317 --> 01:32:16,654
- You're allowed three.
- No, you don't understand.

1536
01:32:18,864 --> 01:32:21,033
There is no man in the sky.

1537
01:32:25,204 --> 01:32:27,373
Why did you say there was?

1538
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:34,004
I couldn't stand the look on my mum's face
when she was dying.

1539
01:32:34,296 --> 01:32:36,924
And things just escalated.

1540
01:32:39,426 --> 01:32:42,388
But how did you say something that wasn't?

1541
01:32:42,471 --> 01:32:45,599
I don't know, I just did. I just can.

1542
01:32:46,058 --> 01:32:48,185
But when I asked you if being rich

1543
01:32:48,269 --> 01:32:51,564
and successful and famous
changed your genetics,

1544
01:32:51,939 --> 01:32:54,191
why didn't you just say yes?

1545
01:32:55,317 --> 01:32:57,403
'Cause it wouldn't count.

1546
01:33:00,322 --> 01:33:01,490
Mark.

1547
01:33:04,368 --> 01:33:05,703

I'm your man.

1551

MARK: So that's it. I got the girl.

1552
01:33:38,527 --> 01:33:41,739
Anna and I are very happy together,
by the way.

1553
01:33:41,822 --> 01:33:45,534
She still doesn't fully understand
how I said or did all those things.

1554
01:33:45,618 --> 01:33:49,455
No one does.
I'm still the only person who can tell a lie.

1555
01:33:49,580 --> 01:33:52,750
Actually, that's not entirely true.

1556
01:33:55,669 --> 01:33:57,463
What do you think?

1557
01:33:58,964 --> 01:34:00,674
That looks good.

1558
01:34:03,469 --> 01:34:05,596
It tastes so good, Mommy.

1559
01:34:05,971 --> 01:34:08,891
- Your best yet.
- I'm so glad you like it.

1560
01:34:09,350 --> 01:34:10,893
Huh? Oh.

1561
01:34:15,689 --> 01:34:17,942
I don't know where to start.

1562
01:34:18,442 --> 01:34:22,780
Just start on the bread, maybe,
then work my way up there.

1563
01:34:23,322 --> 01:34:27,701
You eat that. You liked it so much.
Why don't you eat some more?

1564
01:34:29,495 --> 01:34:30,579
He loves it.

Shall we sit down ?

Right there.

- He's from out of town.
- How long you here for,Joe ?

505
00:37:24,342 --> 00:37:27,038
As long as it takes.

did you say you were on ?

I didn't say.

with my department chief.
- You ate ?

00:38:28,072 --> 00:38:30,097
I'm here, aren't I ?
I wouldn't miss
a loose ends meeting.

He was looking for a doctor.

530
00:39:01,038 --> 00:39:04,735
Well, I guess
he's found one.
<i>[ Susan Chuckling ]</i>

you do get around.

That's your name ?
<i>[ Allison ]</i>
<i>And isn't it a lovely one ?</i>

So sturdy, so straight.

<i>Incidentally, Joe,</i>

- Here.
- You're staying here ?

536

- In this house ?
- Yes, in this house.

Yes, Quince, it is.

here,Joe ?

Cat got your tongue ?

545
00:39:57,361 --> 00:40:00,023
[ Chuckling ]
You weren't so silent
this morning.

546
00:40:01,799 --> 00:40:04,461
This morning, yes.

547
00:40:06,303 --> 00:40:08,203
I wasn't quite myself.

548
00:40:09,774 --> 00:40:14,177
Well, it's a shame
whoever you were
couldn't be here tonight.

<i>Cut it out, Susan.</i>
<i>We've gotta talk.</i>

<i>Busy day tomorrow,</i>

Joe, let's go.

552
00:40:23,454 --> 00:40:25,354
Yes.

553
00:40:34,231 --> 00:40:37,496
That stuff between
you and Susan threw me.

554
00:40:37,635 --> 00:40:39,535
Threw you ?
Where ?

555
00:40:39,637 --> 00:40:41,537
Shook me up.

556
00:40:43,007 --> 00:40:45,601
I mean, how is it
that you happened
to meet my daughter ?

557
00:40:45,743 --> 00:40:47,836
I didn't meet her.

558
00:40:47,978 --> 00:40:49,878
The young man I took
met her.

559
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:53,381
That is, the fellow
she encountered in
the coffee shop this morning.

560
00:40:54,852 --> 00:40:56,717
What happened to him ?

561
00:40:56,854 --> 00:40:59,789
I needed a body, Bill.

562
00:41:03,694 --> 00:41:05,559
So,

563
00:41:08,933 --> 00:41:10,833

You mean this, sir ?
Yes.

turn a woman's head ?

not quite at home
around people.

I get busy doing, uh,
what it is I do.

to have developed--

to perform, and it seems
to take up most of my time.

But sometimes I...
speculate...

654
00:49:46,416 --> 00:49:48,748
that I haven't
left room for...

00:49:57,594 --> 00:49:59,494

00:51:05,829 --> 00:51:08,491
What's on the docket
for today ?

668
00:51:08,598 --> 00:51:13,194
Docket ?
Hmm, yes.
What shall we do ?

669
00:51:13,303 --> 00:51:17,137
Well, I have to
go to work, and--
Splendid. I'll join you.

670
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:19,174
Oh.

671
00:51:19,276 --> 00:51:21,801
[ Chuckles ]
Would you like
to ride or walk ?

672
00:51:21,912 --> 00:51:25,439
Walk. I wish
to see the world.

673
00:51:25,549 --> 00:51:30,145
This is crazy.
This is the left field
thing of all time.

674
00:51:30,253 --> 00:51:33,745
I, uh--
I don't know if
I can get through this.

675
00:51:33,857 --> 00:51:37,054
- What do I do ?
What do I tell my family ?
- You'll get through this, Bill.

676
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:40,652
As far as
your family's concerned, uh,
I wouldn't say anything.

677
00:51:40,764 --> 00:51:43,699
You'll ruin the great start
we had last night.

678
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:48,328
Hmm. It felt as if
I was being treated
like a person.

679
00:51:48,438 --> 00:51:50,372
Yes,Joe this,Joe that.

680
00:51:50,474 --> 00:51:54,604
A nice smile.
Quince passed me the rolls.

681
00:51:54,711 --> 00:51:59,705
No passion or rapture
or any of these mighty things
you're so intent on imparting.

682
00:51:59,816 --> 00:52:01,875
But I am certain,

683
00:52:01,985 --> 00:52:05,079
should you say who I am,
our adventure would
end abruptly.

684
00:52:05,188 --> 00:52:07,588
Mm-hmm.

685
00:52:11,027 --> 00:52:14,019
And I did so enjoy
your family.

686
00:52:16,533 --> 00:52:20,299
What about my family ?
This adventure involves
only me, right ?

687
00:52:20,403 --> 00:52:23,270
What do you mean ?

688
00:52:26,643 --> 00:52:29,840
I'll tell you what.
You promise this undertaking
of yours...

689
00:52:29,946 --> 00:52:31,880
involves only me
and, uh--

690
00:52:31,982 --> 00:52:34,382
And what ?

691
00:52:34,484 --> 00:52:37,146
I won't tell anyone
who you are.
Sounds fair enough.

692
00:52:37,254 --> 00:52:40,485
Good.
Is it a deal ?

693
00:52:40,590 --> 00:52:43,218
A deal ?
Yeah.

694
00:52:43,326 --> 00:52:46,295
You give your word;
I give mine that we'll
do what we say.

695
00:52:46,396 --> 00:52:50,162
Mm-hmm.
It is a truth exchanged
between two people.

696
00:52:50,267 --> 00:52:52,326
Bill ?
What ?

697
00:52:52,435 --> 00:52:55,529
You have a deal.
Ow !

698
00:53:02,145 --> 00:53:04,705
That's great.

699
00:53:07,517 --> 00:53:09,644
Great.

700
00:53:09,753 --> 00:53:13,416
You know,
I got to thinking.

701
00:53:13,523 --> 00:53:17,653
With you here
and seemingly occupied,

702
00:53:17,761 --> 00:53:20,753
how's your work going,
I mean, elsewhere ?

703
00:53:20,864 --> 00:53:24,698
While you were shaving
this morning, you weren't
just shaving.

704
00:53:24,801 --> 00:53:28,100
What do you mean ?
You were hatching ideas,

705
00:53:28,205 --> 00:53:31,140
making plans,
arriving at decisions,
right ?

706
00:53:31,241 --> 00:53:33,175
Yeah, I guess so.

707
00:53:33,276 --> 00:53:36,973
So you understand the concept.
While part of you is busy
doing one thing,

708
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:41,676
another part of you is doing
another, perhaps even attending
to the problems of your work.

709
00:53:41,785 --> 00:53:44,618
Correct ?
Of course.

710
00:53:44,721 --> 00:53:48,384
So you understand the idea.
Congratulations, Bill.

711
00:53:48,491 --> 00:53:51,654
Now multiply that
by infinity, take that
to the depths of forever,

712
00:53:51,761 --> 00:53:54,423
and you still will barely
have a glimpse of what
I'm talking about.

713
00:53:54,531 --> 00:53:57,056
<i>[ Horn Honking ]</i>

714
00:54:01,371 --> 00:54:03,862
Joe ?
Yes, Bill ?

715
00:54:06,610 --> 00:54:09,010
How about giving
a guy a break ?

716
00:54:09,112 --> 00:54:11,080
Make an exception ?

717
00:54:11,181 --> 00:54:14,548
Well, there's one
to every rule.
Not this.

718
00:54:14,651 --> 00:54:17,620
And call my family.
I'd like them to have
dinner with me tonight.

719
00:54:17,721 --> 00:54:20,952
Didn't the family
get together last night ?

720
00:54:21,057 --> 00:54:25,391
Jennifer.
Of course, Mr. Parrish,
right away.

721
00:54:25,495 --> 00:54:28,362
Uh, perhaps you'd like
to wait in my office.
No.

722
00:54:28,465 --> 00:54:32,333
What I'm trying to say
is this is a board meeting
and you're not a member.

723
00:54:32,435 --> 00:54:36,098
I'm sure you'll find a way
to make it all right.
[ Sighs ]

724
00:54:36,206 --> 00:54:39,266
Nice to meet you.

725
00:54:39,376 --> 00:54:41,310
Morning.

726
00:54:41,411 --> 00:54:43,345
[ All ]
Good morning.

727
00:54:45,815 --> 00:54:47,806
Thank you.
Eddie.

728
00:54:47,917 --> 00:54:50,215
Uh, this is Joe Black.

729
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:55,314
He's a personal associate
of mine, and, uh--
Hello, Quince.

730
00:54:55,425 --> 00:54:57,859
Hey.
<i>[ Bill ] He'll be</i>
<i>joining us this morning.</i>

731
00:54:57,961 --> 00:55:02,193
<i>I know this is unusual,</i>
<i>and my apologies, and, uh--</i>

732
00:55:02,299 --> 00:55:05,166
Drew, carry on.
<i>[ Drew ]</i>
<i>It's nice to see you.</i>

733
00:55:05,268 --> 00:55:08,396
Didn't expect you,
but, uh--

734
00:55:08,505 --> 00:55:10,530
certainly you can't get
enough of a good thing.

735
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:14,167
Thank you.
Joe, would you like
to sit there ?

736
00:55:14,277 --> 00:55:16,973
[ Chewing ]

737
00:55:25,855 --> 00:55:27,789
Okay.

738
00:55:27,891 --> 00:55:32,351
<i>Uh, the Board</i>
<i>of Parrish Communications</i>
<i>is hereby called to order.</i>

739
00:55:32,462 --> 00:55:34,396
Our sole order of--

740
00:55:40,170 --> 00:55:42,900
Our s--

741
00:55:50,146 --> 00:55:52,774
Our sole order
of business today is a, uh--

742
00:55:52,882 --> 00:55:56,045
is an acceptance of
John Bontecou's generous offer.

743
00:55:56,152 --> 00:55:59,019
<i>And I think Bill--</i>
Do you have any more
of these delicious cookies ?

744
00:55:59,122 --> 00:56:01,352
<i>Thejelly ones ?</i>

745
00:56:01,458 --> 00:56:03,653
<i>Mmm, and a cup of tea.</i>

746
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:08,663
With milk, I think.
I'd like to try it
English style. Yes.

747
00:56:08,765 --> 00:56:10,699
<i>[Joe ]</i>
<i>A cup of tea</i>
<i>with milk, please.</i>

748
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:12,927
Is there anything else,
Mr. Black ?

749
00:56:13,036 --> 00:56:15,368
- How about some water ?
- Why, yes, thank you.

750
00:56:15,472 --> 00:56:17,372
<i>Hot or cold?</i>
Cold.

751
00:56:17,474 --> 00:56:21,376
- And a glass ?
- Mmm.

752
00:56:25,448 --> 00:56:30,078
Uh, to review.
We're really crossing the T's
and dotting the I's here.

753
00:56:30,186 --> 00:56:34,020
Uh, Bill had a great
and conclusive meeting
yesterday with John Bontecou,

754
00:56:34,124 --> 00:56:37,093
and all that remains for us
is to put it to a vote.

755
00:56:39,796 --> 00:56:44,358
Um, thank you.
Drew, um--

756
00:56:45,702 --> 00:56:47,966
[ Chuckles ]
Yeah.

757
00:56:48,071 --> 00:56:50,938
I did enjoy, or rather
I was interested...

758
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:55,409
in meeting
John Bontecou yesterday,

759
00:56:55,512 --> 00:56:57,605
and, um--

760
00:56:59,249 --> 00:57:04,050
Impressive, I suppose.

761
00:57:04,154 --> 00:57:06,054
But, uh--

762
00:57:09,993 --> 00:57:12,427
But--

763
00:57:12,562 --> 00:57:15,963
It did get me to thinking.

764
00:57:17,700 --> 00:57:21,898
<i>See, I started</i>
<i>in this business because</i>
<i>this is what I wanted to do.</i>

765
00:57:22,005 --> 00:57:26,499
I knew I wasn't gonna write
the great American novel.

766
00:57:26,643 --> 00:57:29,908
But I also knew there was
more to life than buying
something for a dollar...

767
00:57:30,013 --> 00:57:32,880
and selling it for two.

768
00:57:32,982 --> 00:57:36,418
<i>I'd hoped</i>
<i>to create something,</i>
<i>something which could be...</i>

769
00:57:36,553 --> 00:57:39,488
held to
the highest standards.

770
00:57:39,589 --> 00:57:43,457
And what I realized
was I--

771
00:57:43,560 --> 00:57:46,859
I wanted to give
the news to the world.

772
00:57:46,963 --> 00:57:51,263
And I wanted
to give it unvarnished.

773
00:57:51,367 --> 00:57:55,770
Uh, the more we all know
about each other, the greater
the chance we will survive.

774
00:57:55,905 --> 00:57:59,568
Sure, I want to make a profit.
You can't exist without one,
but, uh--

775
00:57:59,676 --> 00:58:03,942
[ Chuckles ]
John Bontecou is all profit.

776
00:58:04,047 --> 00:58:08,916
<i>If we give him</i>
<i>license to absorb</i>
<i>Parrish Communications--</i>

777
00:58:09,018 --> 00:58:11,009
<i>and he has his eye</i>
<i>on a few others after us--</i>

778
00:58:11,154 --> 00:58:13,418
in order to reach the world,

779
00:58:13,523 --> 00:58:17,425
you will have to go
through John Bontecou.

780
00:58:17,527 --> 00:58:19,552
And not only will you
have to pay him
to do this,

781
00:58:19,696 --> 00:58:22,961
far more important,
you'll have to
agree with him.

782
00:58:24,734 --> 00:58:28,534
<i>Reporting the news</i>
<i>is a privilege</i>
<i>and a responsibility.</i>

783
00:58:28,638 --> 00:58:32,130
And it is not exploitable.

784
00:58:32,275 --> 00:58:35,472
Parrish Communications
has earned this privilege.

785
00:58:35,578 --> 00:58:38,979
John Bontecou
wants to buy it.

786
00:58:40,517 --> 00:58:43,213
<i>As your chairman,</i>

787
00:58:43,319 --> 00:58:45,787
I urge you to agree.

788
00:58:45,922 --> 00:58:48,982
This company
is not for sale.

789
00:58:54,998 --> 00:58:57,466
It sounds like
you're not leaving
much room for discussion.

790
00:58:57,600 --> 00:58:59,500
Thank you.
You're welcome.

791
00:58:59,602 --> 00:59:02,002
I know. I'm sorry, I--
Looks like I'm
reversing my field.

792
00:59:02,105 --> 00:59:04,665
That's your privilege, Bill.
But given our needs,

793
00:59:04,807 --> 00:59:07,537
given the absolute necessity
for growth, given the future,

794
00:59:07,644 --> 00:59:11,341
the truth is, joining
John Bontecou is every bit
as certain as death and taxes.

795
00:59:11,447 --> 00:59:14,883
Death and taxes ?
<i>Yes.</i>

796
00:59:15,018 --> 00:59:17,714
- <i>Death</i> and taxes ?
- Yes.

797
00:59:17,820 --> 00:59:20,983
What an odd pairing.
<i>It's just a saying,</i>
<i>Mr. Black.</i>

798
00:59:21,090 --> 00:59:23,615
Mmm. By whom ?
<i>Doesn't matter.</i>

799
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:27,093
- Then why'd
you bring it up ?
- [ Sighs ]

800
00:59:27,196 --> 00:59:29,164
You're not familiar
with the phrase,
''In this world,

801
00:59:29,299 --> 00:59:31,358
nothing is certain
but death and taxes ?''

802
00:59:31,501 --> 00:59:33,992
Well, I am now.
<i>Glad I could be</i>
<i>of some help.</i>

803
00:59:34,137 --> 00:59:37,300
<i>I keep regular office hours</i>
<i>if there's any further</i>
<i>information you might need...</i>

804

on sayings, common phrases,
manners of speaking.

805
00:59:40,476 --> 00:59:44,742
My door's wide open.
The tea I can provide,
perhaps even the milk.

806
00:59:44,847 --> 00:59:46,872
Low fat.

807
00:59:47,016 --> 00:59:49,007
<i>Yeah, okay, well, uh--</i>

808
00:59:49,152 --> 00:59:52,849
I think we've accomplished
everything we're going to this
morning. Shall we adjourn ?

809
00:59:52,956 --> 00:59:56,858
- But the matter is still
on the table, Bill.
-Joe ?

810
00:59:56,993 --> 00:59:59,518
Yes.

811
01:00:06,336 --> 01:00:08,930
Thank you for
the delicious cookies.

812
01:00:11,374 --> 01:00:14,104
[ Chewing ]
Mmm.

813
01:00:16,546 --> 01:00:19,037
Who is that guy ?

814
01:00:21,050 --> 01:00:22,950
So...

815
01:00:24,354 --> 01:00:26,686
what's the deal here ?

816
01:00:26,789 --> 01:00:29,815
You gonna be
breathing down my neck
right till the very end ?

817
01:00:29,959 --> 01:00:33,360
I don't understand.
I'd like to be alone
for a while.

818
01:00:36,232 --> 01:00:40,669
Are you sad, Bill ?
Yes, I am.

819
01:00:40,803 --> 01:00:42,737
Why don't you take
a walk or something,
get some air ?

820
01:00:42,872 --> 01:00:45,397
I know
I'll be seeing you.

821
01:00:45,541 --> 01:00:49,068
[ Chewing ]
Of course.

822
01:00:49,212 --> 01:00:52,409
Good. Now I'd like
to be alone.

823
01:00:52,548 --> 01:00:54,482
This will hold you
for a while.

824
01:00:54,617 --> 01:00:57,245
You know about money,
don't you ?
It can't buy happiness ?

825
01:00:57,387 --> 01:01:00,185
Yeah.
Uh,Jennifer ?

826
01:01:00,289 --> 01:01:03,486
Give Mr. Black a map
of the city, would you ?
It's okay, Bill.

827
01:01:03,626 --> 01:01:06,789
I can manage.

Shall we adjourn ?
Uh, before we do, Bill,
while we're here--

1320
01:38:59,767 --> 01:39:02,258
There's a second question
the board would like
a response to.

1321
01:39:02,369 --> 01:39:06,240
Far simpler one.

1322
01:39:06,240 --> 01:39:09,038
Who is the man
standing to your left ?

1323
01:39:12,179 --> 01:39:14,909
I've already introduced
Mr. Black to you all.

<i>But who is he ?</i>
<i>What are his credentials ?</i>

to you ?

The board
is deeply concerned.

1327
01:39:30,197 --> 01:39:33,633
We have reason to believe
Mr. Black is not only
influencing your decisions...

1328

in regard to this company,

1329
01:39:35,903 --> 01:39:39,430
but that you are relying
on him to make them for you.

1330
01:39:43,744 --> 01:39:46,542
The lack of response, Bill,
is not appropriate.

1331

We are your board.

1332
01:39:49,216 --> 01:39:52,549
We have a right
to know how you are managing
the operations of this company.

1333
01:39:52,653 --> 01:39:57,283
<i>And, most importantly,</i>
<i>that you have not delegated</i>
<i>someone to do it for you.</i>

your choices and feelings...

1735

and spending
the rest of your life
living up to them,

1736

not hurting the object
of your love.

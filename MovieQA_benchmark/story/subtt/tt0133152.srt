1
00:04:15,047 --> 00:04:16,924
You lose.

2
00:04:17,049 --> 00:04:19,510
Again.

3
00:04:23,764 --> 00:04:26,058
Change your flight sequence.

4
00:04:26,183 --> 00:04:29,811
That's enough.
Stop. Pay attention.

5
00:04:29,937 --> 00:04:32,272
Pericles, stop.
I mean it or no treat.

6
00:04:36,068 --> 00:04:40,531
How well do I know you?

7
00:04:59,383 --> 00:05:03,178
<i>Lieutenant Beaudry,
please report to Engineering.</i>

8
00:05:03,262 --> 00:05:05,180
<i>Lieutenant Beaudry to Engineering.</i>

9
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:11,728
- "F" to "E" Good.
- Easy now. Slow down.

10
00:05:11,812 --> 00:05:14,940
- Yes.
- That's it.

11
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:18,986
We did it yesterday.

12
00:05:19,111 --> 00:05:21,280
Hey, there you are.

13
00:05:21,405 --> 00:05:23,949
What? Was the Homo sapien
mean to you again?

14
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:26,243
We all know it's just
rocket envy, don't we?

15
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:28,620
Ever consider an actual boyfriend?

16
00:05:28,704 --> 00:05:30,622
You mean do I enjoy being miserable?

17
00:05:30,706 --> 00:05:32,541
No, thanks. I'll
stick with my chimps.

18
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:35,752
Hey.

19
00:05:39,006 --> 00:05:41,758
- I'm teaching him.
- No, you're teasing him.

20
00:05:41,842 --> 00:05:43,844
Well, he's gene-spliced,
chromosome-enhanced.

21
00:05:43,969 --> 00:05:45,971
He's a state-of-the-art monkey.
He can handle it.

22
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:49,641
When you frustrate them, they lose
focus. They get confused, even violent.

23
00:05:51,143 --> 00:05:55,355
Hey, congratulations, Pericles.
You're gonna be a daddy.

24
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:57,482
Thought I saw a smirk on his face.

25
00:05:57,566 --> 00:06:00,152
Actually, the female
was the aggressive one.

26
00:06:00,277 --> 00:06:03,739
Hey, Leo.
You got a postcard.

27
00:06:05,741 --> 00:06:10,204
Leo! Leo!

28
00:06:10,287 --> 00:06:13,457
Leo, it's been two years. When are you
gonna come home? We miss you!

29
00:06:13,582 --> 00:06:15,709
Don't come home too quick.
I'm really enjoying that apartment.

30
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:18,420
- No! We miss you!
- Are they letting you fly yet?

31
00:06:18,504 --> 00:06:20,422
- No.
- Are the chimps doing all the work?

32
00:06:20,506 --> 00:06:23,509
We got something
to tell you. Uh...

33
00:06:25,594 --> 00:06:28,722
Hey, Leo, when you gonna make
that kind of commitment? You...

34
00:06:53,914 --> 00:06:57,459
Captain
Davidson, report to the bridge.

35
00:07:07,386 --> 00:07:09,596
- We found it.
- It's moving like a storm.

36
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,599
That's what it is.
It's an electromagnetic storm.

37
00:07:12,683 --> 00:07:16,562
- All the digital clocks are stopped.
- It's beautiful.

38
00:07:16,645 --> 00:07:19,022
Yeah, so is the sun
until you get too close to it.

39
00:07:19,106 --> 00:07:22,067
This is weird.
I'm picking up frequency patterns.

40
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:24,069
Tune 'em in.

41
00:07:26,113 --> 00:07:30,200
I'm getting every electronic
communication from Earth from all time.

42
00:07:30,284 --> 00:07:33,662
The storm must be
bouncing it back to us.

43
00:07:33,745 --> 00:07:37,749
Okay, let's get to work. We'll start
with a pass through the central core.

44
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:41,253
Take initial radiation, gamma-ray
readings. You get your monkey ready.

45
00:07:41,336 --> 00:07:45,215
Excuse me, sir, I hope you don't mind
my saying, but this is a waste of time.

46
00:07:45,299 --> 00:07:48,135
We have standard
operating procedures...

47
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:50,721
I'm well aware of the procedures, but if we
go through all of them, it could be gone...

48
00:07:50,846 --> 00:07:52,973
No manned flights.
We start sending out an ape.

49
00:07:53,056 --> 00:07:55,517
If it's safe, we talk
about a pilot. In that order.

50
00:07:55,601 --> 00:07:58,729
You need somebody there who can think.
Why don't you allow me to do my job?

51
00:07:58,854 --> 00:08:00,647
He's the canary.
That's the coal mine.

52
00:08:00,731 --> 00:08:04,318
Your monkey launches at 1600.

53
00:08:20,292 --> 00:08:23,003
All right, you just follow
your sequence and come home.

54
00:08:23,086 --> 00:08:26,048
Understand? Home.

55
00:08:36,475 --> 00:08:40,103
- Stand by.
- Alpha pod launch in 30 seconds.

56
00:08:57,079 --> 00:09:02,000
Chart his course
to the eye of the storm.

57
00:09:02,084 --> 00:09:04,920
Okay, Pericles, start sequence one.

58
00:09:12,219 --> 00:09:15,556
Activate reading systems.

59
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:23,438
Ignition.

60
00:09:30,237 --> 00:09:35,659
Have him
start taking perimeter readings.

61
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:41,081
What's wrong?

62
00:09:41,164 --> 00:09:43,959
- He's off course.
- Lock on him.

63
00:09:46,628 --> 00:09:48,380
He cannot respond.

64
00:09:48,463 --> 00:09:50,507
There's a surge in
the heart rate. He's scared.

65
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:52,009
Light him up again.

66
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:54,428
Can't.

67
00:09:54,511 --> 00:09:58,891
He's gone.

68
00:09:58,974 --> 00:10:01,310
He's trained to come
back to the Oberon.

69
00:10:01,393 --> 00:10:05,105
You think he's still alive?

70
00:10:06,857 --> 00:10:10,903
- Sir-
- For now we just sit tight and wait.

71
00:10:10,986 --> 00:10:14,656
I'm gonna run some
sequences in Delta pod...

72
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:16,658
see if I can figure out
what he did wrong.

73
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:27,044
The signal is breaking up.

74
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:29,213
Stay on him. He must be panicking.

75
00:10:29,296 --> 00:10:31,840
No, he'll do what he's
trained to do, return to the Oberon.

76
00:10:31,924 --> 00:10:35,010
- He's off vector. I can't hold him.
- Okay, that's it. We lost him.

77
00:10:35,093 --> 00:10:39,014
- Want to send up another chimp?
- No, it's too dangerous.

78
00:10:39,097 --> 00:10:44,019
I'm not wasting another pod.
Shut down launch operations.

79
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:19,429
Sir? Delta pod has launched.

80
00:11:22,099 --> 00:11:24,685
Delta pod!
Your flight is not authorized.

81
00:11:24,768 --> 00:11:28,605
- Goin' to get my chimp.
- You bring that thing back now.

82
00:11:28,689 --> 00:11:30,440
Return to base!

83
00:11:30,524 --> 00:11:32,776
Never send a monkey to do a man's job.

84
00:11:54,006 --> 00:11:56,466
Oberon, I got a visual
on Alpha pod. Over.

85
00:12:11,982 --> 00:12:13,609
Oberon, come back!

86
00:12:27,623 --> 00:12:31,585
Oberon, come in!

87
00:12:40,552 --> 00:12:41,970
I'm getting a Mayday.

88
00:12:42,054 --> 00:12:43,972
Alpha pod?

89
00:12:44,056 --> 00:12:46,225
- I don't know. It's coming in strong.
- Put it up.

90
00:12:46,308 --> 00:12:49,478
Mayday!

91
00:12:49,561 --> 00:12:51,939
Mayday! Come in, guidance!
Request instructions!

92
00:12:52,022 --> 00:12:54,566
We're goin' down!
Come in! Mayday!

93
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:58,070
Delta pod, abort.

94
00:17:06,193 --> 00:17:09,029
No! N-N-No!

95
00:18:18,098 --> 00:18:20,017
This one looked at me.

96
00:18:26,523 --> 00:18:31,612
Take your stinkin' hands
off me, you damn dirty human!

97
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:37,701
Hyah! Hyah!

98
00:18:50,839 --> 00:18:55,344
- Hyah!
- Stinkin' humans!

99
00:18:55,427 --> 00:18:59,139
You guys smell!

100
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:10,484
Hyah!

101
00:19:10,567 --> 00:19:12,986
Knives sharpened!

102
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:16,365
Swords and knives sharpened here.

103
00:19:49,815 --> 00:19:53,110
Hey, where am I?

104
00:19:55,362 --> 00:19:57,531
What is this place?

105
00:19:57,614 --> 00:20:01,493
Fresh fruit! Fresh fruit!

106
00:20:01,577 --> 00:20:05,247
Pineapples, bananas, plantains!

107
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:07,082
Fresh fruit!

108
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:11,128
Here, I'm open.
Come on. Here!

109
00:20:11,211 --> 00:20:16,258
You got it! Dribble it down!
Open shot! Take it!

110
00:20:16,341 --> 00:20:20,262
Make way! Clear the path.

111
00:20:20,345 --> 00:20:22,264
Get the humans!

112
00:20:22,347 --> 00:20:25,767
Get outta here!

113
00:20:25,851 --> 00:20:28,437
You guys smell!

114
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:30,480
- Get the humans!
- Take this!

115
00:20:30,564 --> 00:20:32,649
Oh, that was a good one!

116
00:20:32,733 --> 00:20:35,861
Yeah! Get outta here!
Stupid humans!

117
00:20:35,944 --> 00:20:38,363
Stop it!

118
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:42,409
Who told you, you could
throw stones at humans?

119
00:20:42,492 --> 00:20:44,411
- My father.
- Did he?

120
00:20:44,494 --> 00:20:48,916
He's wrong, very wrong.
You can tell him for me I said so.

121
00:20:48,999 --> 00:20:51,627
Human lover.

122
00:20:55,547 --> 00:20:57,174
Let's go!

123
00:20:57,257 --> 00:20:59,134
Hyah!

124
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:12,814
Whoa! Open it up!

125
00:21:17,236 --> 00:21:21,240
What? Are you trying
to put me out of business?

126
00:21:21,323 --> 00:21:24,034
Oh, these are the skankiest...

127
00:21:24,117 --> 00:21:28,038
scabbiest, scuzziest humans
I've ever seen.

128
00:21:28,121 --> 00:21:32,167
- You don't want them?
- I'll take the whole lot.

129
00:21:32,251 --> 00:21:36,839
I must be out of my mind-
out of my mind.

130
00:21:36,922 --> 00:21:39,341
I'll have to make it up on volume.

131
00:21:39,424 --> 00:21:45,180
All right! Get 'em out!
And get 'em clean! Chop, chop!

132
00:21:50,978 --> 00:21:54,147
Let's go.
Keep it moving. Move along.

133
00:21:54,231 --> 00:21:56,233
Come on! Hurry up.
Get out of there.

134
00:21:56,316 --> 00:22:00,529
Hurry up! Let's go.

135
00:22:00,612 --> 00:22:04,449
Gentlemen on the left.
Ladies to the right, please. That way.

136
00:22:04,533 --> 00:22:06,118
Don't be afraid.

137
00:22:06,201 --> 00:22:07,995
Come on.

138
00:22:08,078 --> 00:22:12,791
Very touching really.
I can't see for the tears in my eyes.

139
00:22:12,875 --> 00:22:15,502
Come on. That one's got-
Crawling with lice.

140
00:22:15,586 --> 00:22:18,046
- Hurry.
- Yeah, oh, oh.

141
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:22,092
Check the teeth on that little
one right there. Yeah. Nice.

142
00:22:28,932 --> 00:22:30,976
Get in there!

143
00:22:31,059 --> 00:22:34,354
Stay back. Back!

144
00:22:34,438 --> 00:22:37,107
Get in there!

145
00:22:41,528 --> 00:22:43,739
Move! You too!

146
00:22:43,822 --> 00:22:46,909
How many times do I have to tell you?

147
00:22:46,992 --> 00:22:51,371
Wear gloves when you handle humans.

148
00:22:54,958 --> 00:22:57,503
You're getting soft, Limbo.
You normally hack off a limb.

149
00:22:57,586 --> 00:23:01,298
Uh, yes, General.
That's true.

150
00:23:01,381 --> 00:23:04,801
But, unfortunately,
they're worth more intact.

151
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:08,430
Keep your eye on this one.

152
00:23:11,099 --> 00:23:14,603
He's feisty.

153
00:23:18,357 --> 00:23:22,110
Are these the ones that have been
raiding the orchards, sir?

154
00:23:22,194 --> 00:23:26,698
I know an old country
remedy that never fails.

155
00:23:26,782 --> 00:23:30,619
First, you simply gut one human,
and you string the carcass up.

156
00:23:30,702 --> 00:23:34,581
The human rights faction
are nipping at my heels already.

157
00:23:34,665 --> 00:23:37,084
Do-gooders. Who needs 'em?

158
00:23:37,167 --> 00:23:42,339
I mean, I'm all for free speech,
as long as they keep their mouths shut.

159
00:23:42,422 --> 00:23:44,800
I promised my niece
a pet for her birthday.

160
00:23:46,552 --> 00:23:50,514
Excellent. Oh, the little ones
make wonderful pets.

161
00:23:50,597 --> 00:23:54,226
Oh, but be sure
you get rid of it by puberty.

162
00:23:54,309 --> 00:23:58,522
One thing you don't want
in your house, it's a human teenager.

163
00:23:58,605 --> 00:24:01,942
Oh, yes.

164
00:24:02,025 --> 00:24:05,404
Any one you'd like, sweetheart.

165
00:24:05,487 --> 00:24:07,948
That one.

166
00:24:09,324 --> 00:24:11,243
Oh, isn't she pretty...

167
00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:19,543
I-I'll get that for you, sir.

168
00:24:37,519 --> 00:24:41,190
And I have a pretty new collar...

169
00:24:41,273 --> 00:24:43,609
just for you.

170
00:24:43,692 --> 00:24:46,904
Compliments of the house.

171
00:24:51,491 --> 00:24:54,036
You stink of humans.

172
00:25:05,255 --> 00:25:08,383
It's disgusting
the way they treat humans.

173
00:25:08,467 --> 00:25:10,594
Demeans us as much as them.

174
00:25:17,392 --> 00:25:19,394
Ari, let's go.

175
00:25:25,859 --> 00:25:29,863
Let's get 'em marked!
I got orders to fill!

176
00:25:46,421 --> 00:25:47,631
- No!
- Quiet!

177
00:25:50,801 --> 00:25:52,845
Next!

178
00:26:06,024 --> 00:26:08,652
Oh, no, not you again.

179
00:26:08,735 --> 00:26:10,904
You know me. Just can't
stand by while human beings...

180
00:26:10,988 --> 00:26:13,657
are being mistreated,
tortured, mutilated.

181
00:26:15,367 --> 00:26:20,080
The only reason I put up with your
nonsense is because of your father!

182
00:26:20,163 --> 00:26:23,375
Hey, if you want me to stop,
give up your filthy business.

183
00:26:23,458 --> 00:26:27,796
Hey, I do the job
that nobody else wants.

184
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:30,465
Besides, I don't see
any of you bleeding hearts...

185
00:26:30,549 --> 00:26:33,927
spending all day with these
dangerous, dirty, dumb beasts.

186
00:26:34,803 --> 00:26:36,847
They're not dumb.

187
00:26:36,930 --> 00:26:41,393
They can be taught to live with us
as equals, and I'm gonna prove it.

188
00:26:41,476 --> 00:26:45,063
Don't do that.
Don't do that.

189
00:26:45,147 --> 00:26:47,900
Don't do...

190
00:26:47,983 --> 00:26:49,610
Stay back.

191
00:26:50,652 --> 00:26:53,030
Well, now, there's your proof.

192
00:26:53,113 --> 00:26:56,283
Now I'm gonna have to put him down.

193
00:26:56,366 --> 00:27:00,746
Help me. Please.

194
00:27:00,829 --> 00:27:02,956
Please help me.

195
00:27:05,417 --> 00:27:08,504
You are giving me such a headache.

196
00:27:12,925 --> 00:27:15,135
I don't need this aggravation!

197
00:27:15,219 --> 00:27:17,638
Sell him to me.

198
00:27:17,721 --> 00:27:21,475
Are you crazy?
He's wild. They're both wild.

199
00:27:21,558 --> 00:27:26,855
- Then I'll buy them both.
- Oh, now, that would be expensive.

200
00:27:26,939 --> 00:27:32,611
That would be very, very expensive.

201
00:27:39,159 --> 00:27:43,914
I'm sure we can, you know,
come to a deal.

202
00:27:45,457 --> 00:27:49,378
No?

203
00:27:51,964 --> 00:27:55,634
Deliver them to my house.

204
00:27:58,679 --> 00:28:01,056
Semos, help me.

205
00:28:01,139 --> 00:28:06,562
Rise when your master enters.

206
00:28:09,648 --> 00:28:14,278
Wild humans in my house?

207
00:28:15,863 --> 00:28:17,906
Yes, but this one seems different.

208
00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:21,869
Different? How could he be different?
You can't tell one from the other.

209
00:28:21,952 --> 00:28:25,163
My guests are here.

210
00:28:25,247 --> 00:28:28,959
Keep the savage ones out of sight.

211
00:28:33,338 --> 00:28:35,799
And especially from General Thade!

212
00:28:35,883 --> 00:28:40,262
And you better be nice to him!

213
00:28:41,805 --> 00:28:46,435
And wash your hands before dinner.

214
00:28:51,690 --> 00:28:54,943
Senator Nado, good evening.

215
00:28:55,027 --> 00:28:56,945
My dear, you look lovely.

216
00:28:57,029 --> 00:28:59,531
Thank you,
but I'm having a bad hair day.

217
00:28:59,615 --> 00:29:02,701
Yet she spends
a fortune grooming herself.

218
00:29:02,784 --> 00:29:04,912
- And I'm worth every penny.
- Ha, ha.

219
00:29:07,206 --> 00:29:09,583
Would you like to freshen up?

220
00:29:09,666 --> 00:29:11,627
We're fine.

221
00:29:27,518 --> 00:29:30,687
How the hell did these
monkeys get like this?

222
00:29:30,771 --> 00:29:34,858
- What other way would they be?
- They'd be begging me for a treat now.

223
00:29:34,942 --> 00:29:37,110
What tribe are you from?

224
00:29:38,362 --> 00:29:40,322
U.S. Air Force.
I'm going back to it.

225
00:29:55,504 --> 00:29:59,675
Finish your work.

226
00:30:04,012 --> 00:30:06,682
Please, everyone sit.

227
00:30:08,141 --> 00:30:11,144
We just returned from our
country house in the rain forest.

228
00:30:11,228 --> 00:30:13,146
How was it?

229
00:30:13,230 --> 00:30:16,024
- Boring.
- I find it relaxing...

230
00:30:16,108 --> 00:30:19,528
being away from
the frantic pace of the city.

231
00:30:19,611 --> 00:30:21,947
I wanted to go out,
but there was no place to go.

232
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:25,450
Nothing but trees and rocks.

233
00:30:25,534 --> 00:30:28,829
- All you did was nap.
- Exactly.

234
00:30:28,912 --> 00:30:33,542
A bit of time away from politics is
what is needed for a weary soul like me.

235
00:30:33,625 --> 00:30:36,128
Ah, we used to lose ourselves...

236
00:30:36,211 --> 00:30:39,715
for days in the rain forest
when we were young.

237
00:30:39,798 --> 00:30:42,134
Now I can barely climb a tree.

238
00:30:42,217 --> 00:30:46,555
Trite but true,
youth is wasted on the young.

239
00:30:49,057 --> 00:30:51,977
Oh, how did I get so old so fast?

240
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:56,648
Living with your daughter, Senator,
would age any ape quickly.

241
00:30:56,732 --> 00:30:59,401
You've long been
a stranger in our house.

242
00:30:59,484 --> 00:31:02,821
I apologize for my lateness, Senator.

243
00:31:05,490 --> 00:31:07,743
I stopped to see my father.

244
00:31:07,826 --> 00:31:11,121
- How is my old friend doing?
- Slipping, I'm afraid.

245
00:31:11,205 --> 00:31:15,876
I'd like to spend more time
with him, but these are troubled days.

246
00:31:15,959 --> 00:31:18,212
The humans infest the provinces.

247
00:31:18,295 --> 00:31:20,756
Yes, because our cities
encroach upon their habitat.

248
00:31:20,839 --> 00:31:24,343
They breed too quickly while
we grow soft in our affluence.

249
00:31:24,426 --> 00:31:27,012
Even now they outnumber us
four to one.

250
00:31:27,095 --> 00:31:29,806
Why can't the government
simply sterilize them all?

251
00:31:29,890 --> 00:31:32,935
The cost would be prohibitive.

252
00:31:33,018 --> 00:31:35,562
Although, our scientists do tell me...

253
00:31:35,646 --> 00:31:38,941
these humans carry terrible diseases.

254
00:31:39,024 --> 00:31:40,943
How would we know that?

255
00:31:41,026 --> 00:31:43,278
The army burns the bodies
before they're examined.

256
00:31:47,282 --> 00:31:49,660
Father?

257
00:31:51,495 --> 00:31:52,829
Mm-hmm.

258
00:31:52,913 --> 00:31:56,208
Uh, at times perhaps...

259
00:31:56,291 --> 00:32:01,171
the Senate feels that the army
has been a tad extreme.

260
00:32:01,255 --> 00:32:05,843
Extremism in defense of apes
is no vice, Senator.

261
00:32:07,010 --> 00:32:09,847
Your ideas threaten our prosperity.

262
00:32:09,930 --> 00:32:13,517
The human problem cannot be
solved by simply throwing money at it.

263
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,769
The government tried that once.

264
00:32:15,853 --> 00:32:20,065
All we got for it was a welfare state
that nearly bankrupted us.

265
00:32:20,148 --> 00:32:24,570
I think the city has about
as much diversity as I can handle.

266
00:32:24,653 --> 00:32:29,992
Look. Look at this garment.
This was made by one of my humans.

267
00:32:31,618 --> 00:32:33,787
Can you deny the skill?

268
00:32:33,871 --> 00:32:37,499
Isn't it obvious that they
are capable of a real culture?

269
00:32:37,583 --> 00:32:41,920
Everything in the human culture
takes place below the waist.

270
00:32:50,095 --> 00:32:53,182
Bow your heads!

271
00:32:54,558 --> 00:32:58,812
We give thanks to you, Semos,
for the fruit of the land.

272
00:32:58,896 --> 00:33:03,859
Bless us, holy Father,
who created all apes in his image.

273
00:33:03,942 --> 00:33:09,656
Hasten the day when you will return
and bring peace to your children.

274
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:12,409
- Amen.
- Amen.

275
00:33:19,291 --> 00:33:23,879
Next you'll be telling us
these beasts have a soul.

276
00:33:23,962 --> 00:33:25,422
Of course they do.

277
00:33:25,506 --> 00:33:29,551
The senator's daughter
flirts with blasphemy.

278
00:33:40,687 --> 00:33:44,441
Is there a soul in there?

279
00:33:56,745 --> 00:34:00,165
Do you have a towel?

280
00:34:04,670 --> 00:34:07,589
I've lost my appetite.

281
00:34:28,569 --> 00:34:31,029
Hmm. Hmm.

282
00:34:32,114 --> 00:34:34,074
Hmm.

283
00:34:42,875 --> 00:34:47,171
I have no patience for these
society dinners. I came to see you.

284
00:34:47,254 --> 00:34:51,758
Oh, how sweet.
You've wasted your time.

285
00:34:51,842 --> 00:34:54,428
My feelings haven't changed.

286
00:34:54,511 --> 00:34:57,055
I still care about you.

287
00:35:00,184 --> 00:35:05,147
You only care about my father's
influence... and your own ambition.

288
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:13,322
I know about the trouble you caused
today. I could have you arrested.

289
00:35:13,405 --> 00:35:16,825
I'd do it again.

290
00:35:16,909 --> 00:35:20,787
You feel so much for these humans...

291
00:35:20,871 --> 00:35:23,498
yet you feel nothing for me.

292
00:35:35,969 --> 00:35:37,930
A moment, sir.

293
00:35:38,013 --> 00:35:40,849
What is it?

294
00:35:40,933 --> 00:35:43,977
- We found something.
- What?

295
00:35:44,061 --> 00:35:46,355
We think you should see it.

296
00:36:15,509 --> 00:36:18,554
There's a curfew for humans.

297
00:36:18,637 --> 00:36:21,139
If they see you on the street
at night, they kill you on sight.

298
00:36:21,223 --> 00:36:23,559
You stay here, you're already dead.

299
00:36:27,145 --> 00:36:29,857
Can you lead me back
to the place where they caught us?

300
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:32,442
Not without my family.

301
00:36:52,087 --> 00:36:55,382
Here. This is
where I saw it.

302
00:36:55,465 --> 00:36:57,384
Go on.

303
00:36:57,467 --> 00:37:02,431
Something fell from the sky
with wings of fire.

304
00:37:02,514 --> 00:37:06,602
There was a thunderous sound,
and the ground itself shook.

305
00:37:06,685 --> 00:37:08,604
Sure you weren't dreaming this?

306
00:37:08,687 --> 00:37:13,108
It was no dream,
sir. Look.

307
00:37:20,073 --> 00:37:23,035
- You told no one about this?
- No, sir.

308
00:37:23,118 --> 00:37:26,788
We knew we had to come right to you.

309
00:37:26,872 --> 00:37:30,375
You did exactly the right thing.

310
00:38:17,339 --> 00:38:19,758
Do you smell that?

311
00:38:19,842 --> 00:38:22,594
Don't start now.
We're off duty.

312
00:38:22,678 --> 00:38:25,222
And I'm starving.

313
00:38:35,732 --> 00:38:37,651
You're hurt.

314
00:38:37,734 --> 00:38:40,237
How did you get away?

315
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:00,674
- Who are you?
- Somebody trying to get out of here.

316
00:39:04,469 --> 00:39:07,639
She promised to show me the way
back to where they caught us.

317
00:39:07,723 --> 00:39:10,350
This is one of their house humans.

318
00:39:10,434 --> 00:39:13,103
- Shh. He thinks he's better than us.
- He thinks he's part ape.

319
00:39:13,187 --> 00:39:15,022
Hey!

320
00:39:16,398 --> 00:39:18,567
We'll go together.

321
00:39:55,687 --> 00:39:58,273
Oooh.

322
00:40:49,616 --> 00:40:53,036
Good night, little girl.

323
00:41:16,059 --> 00:41:19,855
You go this way. You go that way.
The rest of you, come with me!

324
00:41:35,037 --> 00:41:37,706
Send a squad to
the north gate. Hurry!

325
00:41:38,874 --> 00:41:41,418
Wait. Someone's comin'.

326
00:41:56,350 --> 00:41:58,977
You're lucky I found you
before they did. You're surrounded.

327
00:41:59,061 --> 00:42:02,105
Come. Back to the house.
I can reason with them.

328
00:42:02,189 --> 00:42:05,484
- We know how apes reason.
- Is there another way out of the city?

329
00:42:05,567 --> 00:42:08,320
Do not get involved with these humans.

330
00:42:08,403 --> 00:42:10,322
Why did you help me?

331
00:42:10,405 --> 00:42:13,492
Huh? Why would you
take that chance?

332
00:42:13,575 --> 00:42:16,703
I- 'Cause...

333
00:42:16,787 --> 00:42:20,666
you're... not usual.

334
00:42:20,749 --> 00:42:23,585
Show me a way out, I promise you
I'll show you something...

335
00:42:23,669 --> 00:42:25,587
that will change your world forever.

336
00:42:30,634 --> 00:42:33,095
Trust me.

337
00:42:42,437 --> 00:42:45,732
When I was little, I- I used to
sneak outside the city walls...

338
00:42:45,816 --> 00:42:48,318
where... no one
could find me.

339
00:42:48,402 --> 00:42:52,406
I- I can show you the way.

340
00:42:52,489 --> 00:42:56,201
If we are caught, then not even
your father can protect us.

341
00:42:56,285 --> 00:42:59,079
Trust me.

342
00:43:03,292 --> 00:43:06,128
What about her?

343
00:43:06,211 --> 00:43:08,255
A human child cannot
survive the journey.

344
00:43:08,338 --> 00:43:11,008
Bon can take her.
Take her and hide her at home.

345
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:28,859
Check every house.

346
00:43:30,986 --> 00:43:34,323
- Have you seen any humans?
- No, I haven't.

347
00:43:42,706 --> 00:43:44,416
Hurry.

348
00:43:47,878 --> 00:43:50,547
- Father-
- Don't worry. I'll be right beside you.

349
00:43:50,631 --> 00:43:53,008
Come on.

350
00:44:08,899 --> 00:44:11,902
No!

351
00:44:12,903 --> 00:44:15,280
Stop!

352
00:44:39,888 --> 00:44:41,932
Where are the other humans?

353
00:44:42,015 --> 00:44:44,476
Through the tunnels.
They can't have gone far.

354
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:47,980
When you find them, kill them all.

355
00:44:48,063 --> 00:44:52,734
Except for the troublemaker.
I wanna talk to him before he dies.

356
00:44:52,818 --> 00:44:55,863
Sir, the senator's daughter
is with them.

357
00:44:58,740 --> 00:45:00,868
- They took her?
- She's helping them.

358
00:45:00,951 --> 00:45:03,120
I saw her myself.

359
00:45:07,499 --> 00:45:11,712
She had no choice.
They threatened her life.

360
00:45:11,795 --> 00:45:15,424
I'll report the message
to the senate myself.

361
00:45:15,507 --> 00:45:18,218
They'll beat their chests
and ask for my help.

362
00:45:18,302 --> 00:45:21,305
They are weak without you, sir.

363
00:45:41,241 --> 00:45:44,411
- Your father was a brave man.
- What do you know about my father?

364
00:45:48,665 --> 00:45:51,126
Let me go.

365
00:45:56,632 --> 00:45:59,635
Thade will be here soon.
There's still time to go back.

366
00:46:02,387 --> 00:46:04,306
I can't now.

367
00:46:24,993 --> 00:46:26,912
That's where I flew in.

368
00:46:29,498 --> 00:46:32,709
- You did that?
- No, my retro-burners.

369
00:46:32,793 --> 00:46:34,753
Sure he'll explain everything.

370
00:46:34,837 --> 00:46:37,631
There's no way to explain
what can't exist.

371
00:46:37,714 --> 00:46:39,967
Talking monkeys can't exist.

372
00:46:46,139 --> 00:46:48,267
Apes.

373
00:46:48,350 --> 00:46:51,937
Monkeys are further down
the evolutionary ladder...

374
00:46:52,020 --> 00:46:55,732
just above humans.

375
00:46:59,987 --> 00:47:01,864
Calm down, will you?

376
00:47:03,115 --> 00:47:08,078
What's wrong?

377
00:47:08,161 --> 00:47:10,998
Apes are afraid of the water.
They can't swim.

378
00:47:11,081 --> 00:47:13,876
- We drown.
- That's why every day we pray for rain.

379
00:47:41,278 --> 00:47:44,990
How long can a human
hold his breath under water?

380
00:48:37,209 --> 00:48:39,878
I thought you guys
were afraid of water.

381
00:48:39,962 --> 00:48:42,047
Two dead monkey...

382
00:48:42,130 --> 00:48:44,132
apes- apes down
at the bottom.

383
00:48:45,259 --> 00:48:47,845
Someone else knows you're here.

384
00:49:08,198 --> 00:49:11,743
- What is that?
- It's a messenger.

385
00:49:11,827 --> 00:49:13,787
Keeps an open frequency
with my ship so I can talk to them.

386
00:49:13,871 --> 00:49:16,123
What, it talks?

387
00:49:16,206 --> 00:49:19,376
- With radio waves.
- Sorcery.

388
00:49:19,459 --> 00:49:21,420
It's not sorcery.
It's science.

389
00:49:30,387 --> 00:49:34,224
I have contact.
Jesus, they're already here.

390
00:49:34,308 --> 00:49:36,268
They must be waiting for me.

391
00:49:36,351 --> 00:49:39,188
The messenger has a homing beacon
that will lead us to them.

392
00:49:40,731 --> 00:49:43,650
We're in control now.
We're the 800-pound gorilla.

393
00:49:47,404 --> 00:49:49,323
Who are you?

394
00:49:49,406 --> 00:49:52,034
Captain Leo Davidson,
a pilot in the U.S. Air Force.

395
00:49:52,117 --> 00:49:55,454
- I come from a planet called Earth.
- Your apes permit you to fly?

396
00:49:55,537 --> 00:49:57,164
Our apes live in zoos.
They do what we tell them.

397
00:49:59,583 --> 00:50:03,128
I think it's fair
to call this hostile territory.

398
00:50:03,212 --> 00:50:06,673
We got exactly 36 hours to rendezvous with
my friends, and I'm out of this nightmare.

399
00:50:06,757 --> 00:50:09,301
What happens to us?
Where do we go?

400
00:50:11,762 --> 00:50:14,556
You're going nowhere.
This one still belongs to me.

401
00:50:16,433 --> 00:50:19,478
- Stop!
- You I've had enough of!

402
00:50:33,075 --> 00:50:35,577
Take it easy, little fella.

403
00:50:35,661 --> 00:50:37,829
I'm not gonna hurt ya.

404
00:50:37,913 --> 00:50:40,582
I wouldn't hurt my own property.

405
00:50:44,086 --> 00:50:46,255
But for you, I'll make an exception.

406
00:50:51,969 --> 00:50:56,640
Hey, no harm done.
Come here, kid.

407
00:50:56,723 --> 00:50:58,976
Come here.

408
00:50:59,059 --> 00:51:01,353
You're not hurt, right?

409
00:51:01,436 --> 00:51:03,730
You're young.
Hoo-hoo-hoo.

410
00:51:03,814 --> 00:51:07,568
Oh, these kids,
they bounce right back.

411
00:51:07,651 --> 00:51:10,362
Play dead.

412
00:51:10,445 --> 00:51:13,156
- Kill him.
- Slave trader.

413
00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:16,326
Shh. Shh.

414
00:51:16,410 --> 00:51:19,329
You kill him, and you'll only
lower yourself to his level.

415
00:51:19,413 --> 00:51:21,874
Exactly.

416
00:51:21,957 --> 00:51:24,418
Oh, she is extremely smart.

417
00:51:24,501 --> 00:51:27,796
You know, I've heard her
talking about apes and humans...

418
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:32,050
uh, uh, separate but equal,
to each his own.

419
00:51:32,134 --> 00:51:34,636
Or something like that, right?

420
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:37,848
Look, whatever it is,
I-I agree with it completely.

421
00:51:37,931 --> 00:51:40,767
Can't we all just get along?

422
00:51:45,981 --> 00:51:48,233
I'm probably just
in the way right now.

423
00:51:48,317 --> 00:51:51,320
So why don't I just get going, hmm?

424
00:51:52,779 --> 00:51:55,991
- He'll lead them to us.
- Then we'll make him our guest.

425
00:51:57,826 --> 00:52:00,162
Cuff him.

426
00:52:01,163 --> 00:52:03,081
Uh...

427
00:52:03,165 --> 00:52:05,334
Ow!

428
00:52:05,417 --> 00:52:07,794
Aah! These things hurt.

429
00:52:12,174 --> 00:52:15,594
- What the hell are you doin'?
- You could use that against us.

430
00:52:15,677 --> 00:52:18,222
- I can't allow that.
- Who would invent such a horrible thing?

431
00:52:18,305 --> 00:52:21,099
- That thing was gonna keep us alive.
- We're better off without it.

432
00:52:21,183 --> 00:52:24,311
- What do you mean, "we"?
- Must you be so difficult?

433
00:52:24,394 --> 00:52:25,854
Why don't I act more like a slave?

434
00:52:25,938 --> 00:52:28,774
- That's not what I meant.
- Shut up!

435
00:52:28,857 --> 00:52:31,360
That goes for all species.

436
00:52:41,119 --> 00:52:46,834
If ever I thought that those humans
were capable of kidnapping my daughter...

437
00:52:46,917 --> 00:52:49,253
Don't blame yourself, Senator.

438
00:52:49,336 --> 00:52:52,798
Your family, above all, have been
compassionate with the humans.

439
00:52:52,881 --> 00:52:56,760
- Look how they've repaid you.
- Can you find her?

440
00:52:59,721 --> 00:53:01,640
If you untie my hands.

441
00:53:01,723 --> 00:53:04,142
What do you want?

442
00:53:04,226 --> 00:53:07,104
Declare martial law.

443
00:53:07,187 --> 00:53:10,607
Give me absolute power...

444
00:53:10,691 --> 00:53:13,652
to rid this planet
of the humans once and for all.

445
00:53:15,946 --> 00:53:20,325
Now is not the time
to be timid or indecisive.

446
00:53:20,409 --> 00:53:24,079
I am the only one who can bring
your daughter back to you alive.

447
00:53:44,057 --> 00:53:46,185
He's not in the city.

448
00:53:46,268 --> 00:53:48,979
We underestimate this human.

449
00:53:50,314 --> 00:53:52,274
I will hunt him down myself.

450
00:54:00,574 --> 00:54:04,995
Your father sent me to find you.
You must come quickly.

451
00:54:06,747 --> 00:54:10,000
Alert the outposts.
Don't let the humans pass.

452
00:54:10,083 --> 00:54:12,544
I understand, sir.

453
00:54:12,628 --> 00:54:15,547
Apart from my father,
I rely on you the most.

454
00:54:15,631 --> 00:54:17,591
We are not just soldiers.

455
00:54:17,674 --> 00:54:21,595
We are friends.
I am depending on you.

456
00:54:21,678 --> 00:54:23,388
Yes, sir.

457
00:54:38,612 --> 00:54:42,157
- So many questions I want to ask.
- Me too.

458
00:54:42,241 --> 00:54:47,454
These zoos you speak of, what
are they? This word is not familiar.

459
00:54:47,538 --> 00:54:50,916
- Zoos are where you find our last few apes.
- What happened to them?

460
00:54:50,999 --> 00:54:55,504
Gone. After we
cut down their forests...

461
00:54:55,587 --> 00:54:59,007
the ones who survived...

462
00:54:59,091 --> 00:55:01,718
were locked up in cages
for amusement...

463
00:55:01,802 --> 00:55:04,429
or used for scientific experiments.

464
00:55:04,513 --> 00:55:08,433
- That's horrible.
- We do worse to our own kind.

465
00:55:08,517 --> 00:55:11,603
I don't understand. You seem
to possess such intelligence.

466
00:55:11,687 --> 00:55:13,605
Yeah, we're pretty smart.

467
00:55:13,689 --> 00:55:15,732
The smarter we get, the more
dangerous our world becomes.

468
00:55:15,816 --> 00:55:19,695
Hmm. I knew it.
You're sensitive.

469
00:55:19,778 --> 00:55:23,031
It's an uncommon quality in a male.

470
00:55:24,658 --> 00:55:28,787
Why don't your apes object
to the way you treat them?

471
00:55:28,871 --> 00:55:30,873
Our apes can't talk.

472
00:55:30,956 --> 00:55:33,584
Maybe they choose not to
given the way you treat them.

473
00:55:36,795 --> 00:55:39,590
Apes in cages.
Right.

474
00:56:02,279 --> 00:56:04,281
Father.

475
00:56:08,202 --> 00:56:10,954
I don't have much time.

476
00:56:11,038 --> 00:56:14,333
Tell me...
about this human...

477
00:56:14,416 --> 00:56:16,335
who troubles you.

478
00:56:16,418 --> 00:56:20,422
I will capture him
with little trouble.

479
00:56:22,216 --> 00:56:25,636
No. You're not
telling me everything.

480
00:56:26,762 --> 00:56:31,975
You believe he is not born
of this world.

481
00:56:33,060 --> 00:56:35,020
Has he come alone?

482
00:56:35,103 --> 00:56:37,856
Yes.

483
00:56:37,940 --> 00:56:40,817
More will come looking for him.

484
00:56:40,901 --> 00:56:43,153
How can you possibly know?

485
00:56:47,074 --> 00:56:50,661
I... have something
to tell you...

486
00:56:50,744 --> 00:56:53,539
something my father told me...

487
00:56:53,622 --> 00:56:57,417
and his father told him...

488
00:56:57,501 --> 00:57:02,089
back along our bloodlines to Semos.

489
00:57:03,632 --> 00:57:06,009
In the time before time...

490
00:57:06,093 --> 00:57:08,178
we were the slaves...

491
00:57:08,262 --> 00:57:11,974
and the humans...
were the masters.

492
00:57:13,058 --> 00:57:14,977
Impossible.

493
00:57:38,125 --> 00:57:40,169
Break it.

494
00:57:59,146 --> 00:58:03,859
What you hold in your hand
is the proof of their power...

495
00:58:03,942 --> 00:58:08,822
their power of invention,
their power of technology.

496
00:58:08,906 --> 00:58:13,076
Against this,
our strength means nothing.

497
00:58:17,539 --> 00:58:21,919
This has the power
of a thousand spears.

498
00:58:23,128 --> 00:58:25,047
I warn you...

499
00:58:25,130 --> 00:58:29,718
their ingenuity goes
hand in hand with their cruelty.

500
00:58:30,802 --> 00:58:32,721
No creature...

501
00:58:32,804 --> 00:58:36,808
is as devious, as violent.

502
00:58:36,892 --> 00:58:40,229
You must find this human quickly.

503
00:58:40,312 --> 00:58:44,650
Do not let him get to Calima.

504
00:58:44,733 --> 00:58:46,860
The forbidden area?

505
00:58:48,529 --> 00:58:53,575
Calima holds the secret
to our true beginnings.

506
00:58:56,578 --> 00:58:58,664
Damn them.

507
00:58:58,747 --> 00:59:01,750
I will stop him, Father.

508
00:59:03,126 --> 00:59:07,089
Damn them.
Damn them all to hell!

509
00:59:47,921 --> 00:59:49,840
What is it?

510
00:59:51,466 --> 00:59:53,886
The apes put them
where they don't want us to go.

511
00:59:53,969 --> 00:59:57,556
Why? What's so important
on the other side of that hill?

512
00:59:57,639 --> 00:59:59,933
It leads all the way
to the sacred ruins at Calima.

513
01:00:00,017 --> 01:00:02,561
- What is that?
- Calima?

514
01:00:02,644 --> 01:00:06,565
That's where- Well,
according to our holy writings...

515
01:00:06,648 --> 01:00:08,734
that is where creation began.

516
01:00:08,817 --> 01:00:14,114
Where the Almighty
breathed life into Semos...

517
01:00:14,198 --> 01:00:16,825
the first ape...

518
01:00:16,909 --> 01:00:19,912
in the time before time.

519
01:00:22,581 --> 01:00:25,459
It is where Semos will return.

520
01:00:25,542 --> 01:00:31,006
Of course, most educated apes consider
such religious notions as fairy tales...

521
01:00:31,089 --> 01:00:35,511
metaphors we use to
explain our origins.

522
01:00:35,594 --> 01:00:38,847
I doubt if there ever
really was a Semos.

523
01:00:41,975 --> 01:00:46,480
Well, that's where my crew is,
so that's where we're going.

524
01:00:46,563 --> 01:00:49,358
Doesn't he ever stop?

525
01:01:09,670 --> 01:01:12,756
- Are you sure the apes are scared of water?
- Yes.

526
01:01:12,840 --> 01:01:15,175
We should cross the river
another way- over the mountains.

527
01:01:15,259 --> 01:01:19,221
There's no time. It's dark.
We're going right through.

528
01:01:24,935 --> 01:01:28,605
Semos smiles on me.

529
01:01:28,689 --> 01:01:32,651
I win again.

530
01:01:32,734 --> 01:01:35,404
You win too often. What have you
hidden up your sleeve?

531
01:01:37,739 --> 01:01:40,784
All of them!

532
01:01:40,868 --> 01:01:43,662
Cheater!

533
01:01:53,422 --> 01:01:56,341
Who's in charge here?

534
01:01:56,425 --> 01:02:00,721
I am, sir. They did not tell me
you were coming.

535
01:02:00,804 --> 01:02:02,723
This camp is a disgrace!

536
01:02:02,806 --> 01:02:04,850
Some humans have escaped.

537
01:02:04,933 --> 01:02:07,853
If they come this way,
we will crush them.

538
01:02:07,936 --> 01:02:11,481
These humans are different.
They travel with apes.

539
01:02:15,777 --> 01:02:19,823
- You find this amusing?
- No, sir.

540
01:02:19,907 --> 01:02:24,536
I'm assuming command. I'll personally
make sure this camp is prepared.

541
01:02:46,767 --> 01:02:48,977
All right. Just grab
the reins with one hand.

542
01:02:49,061 --> 01:02:52,105
Hold onto this as tight as you can with
the other. We're gonna cross the river.

543
01:02:56,610 --> 01:03:01,114
Hey, horses are great swimmers.
They'll carry you across, okay? Okay.

544
01:03:06,411 --> 01:03:09,915
Yeah, well, good luck,
everybody. Have a nice ride.

545
01:03:09,998 --> 01:03:13,335
- Just leave me. I'll slow you down.
- You're letting him go?

546
01:03:13,418 --> 01:03:15,337
- Bless you.
- No. He'll ride with us.

547
01:03:15,420 --> 01:03:18,674
No, wait, wait, wait.
This is suicide.

548
01:03:18,757 --> 01:03:23,428
Ride through an army encampment.
Only a human would think that this could work.

549
01:03:41,071 --> 01:03:45,534
Hear my prayers, Semos,
father of all apes.

550
01:04:15,772 --> 01:04:18,066
No, no!
I'm on your side!

551
01:04:24,656 --> 01:04:27,075
Come on!

552
01:05:37,855 --> 01:05:41,441
Come on. We have to swim.

553
01:05:41,525 --> 01:05:46,196
Hey! I won't
let go of you.

554
01:05:46,280 --> 01:05:48,448
Come on.

555
01:06:30,157 --> 01:06:33,619
- No, no. Wait. There's no need now.
- Says who?

556
01:06:33,702 --> 01:06:36,246
Says them.
They tried to kill me...

557
01:06:36,330 --> 01:06:40,334
like I was nothing
but a- a-a miserable...

558
01:06:40,417 --> 01:06:42,503
Human?

559
01:07:17,788 --> 01:07:19,915
- Ow!
- You're hurt.

560
01:07:19,998 --> 01:07:24,253
She was holding on pretty tight.

561
01:07:24,336 --> 01:07:27,089
Soldiers will head downstream
until they find a crossing.

562
01:07:27,172 --> 01:07:29,091
We should move quickly.

563
01:07:35,889 --> 01:07:39,017
- Where is he?
- They crossed the river.

564
01:07:39,101 --> 01:07:41,311
And you didn't stop them?

565
01:07:41,395 --> 01:07:43,772
They were carried by horses.

566
01:07:46,358 --> 01:07:50,320
Horses?

567
01:07:50,404 --> 01:07:53,407
Our horses, sir.

568
01:08:29,818 --> 01:08:34,114
Forgive me, my friend.
I'm not angry with you.

569
01:08:34,198 --> 01:08:36,241
My father was taken from me.

570
01:08:36,325 --> 01:08:38,535
He was a great leader.

571
01:08:38,619 --> 01:08:41,246
Your family are direct
descendants of Semos.

572
01:08:41,330 --> 01:08:44,166
And now it is time for you to lead.

573
01:08:46,835 --> 01:08:50,130
- Form the divisions.
- Form divisions!

574
01:08:54,343 --> 01:08:57,012
Full battle ready!

575
01:08:59,223 --> 01:09:02,226
Sound the call to march!

576
01:09:32,130 --> 01:09:34,925
Tomorrow we reach Calima.

577
01:09:49,439 --> 01:09:51,942
He'll stay like that all night.

578
01:09:53,151 --> 01:09:55,070
He's a soldier, isn't he?

579
01:09:55,153 --> 01:09:59,825
A general. Well, he was
till he opposed Thade.

580
01:09:59,908 --> 01:10:03,954
And then when Thade ruined
his career, my father took him in.

581
01:10:05,497 --> 01:10:07,833
He was a great soldier.

582
01:10:07,916 --> 01:10:11,795
Attar was his best pupil,
and now they're enemies.

583
01:10:16,967 --> 01:10:19,511
I'd like to see your world.

584
01:10:19,595 --> 01:10:22,097
I don't know.

585
01:10:22,181 --> 01:10:24,850
They'd probably prod you and
poke you and throw you in a cage too.

586
01:10:27,352 --> 01:10:29,313
You'd protect me.

587
01:10:43,243 --> 01:10:46,705
They think you're going to save them.

588
01:10:48,290 --> 01:10:52,336
Tomorrow after you meet your friends,
we'll never see you again.

589
01:10:54,171 --> 01:10:57,549
That's what I've been trying to tell
them. I didn't promise them anything.

590
01:10:57,633 --> 01:10:59,551
No.

591
01:11:00,844 --> 01:11:03,555
You just dropped in from the stars.

592
01:12:17,921 --> 01:12:19,882
They're not here.

593
01:12:32,686 --> 01:12:34,563
Hello?

594
01:12:47,117 --> 01:12:49,578
They were never here.

595
01:12:52,831 --> 01:12:55,417
You said they'd come for us.

596
01:13:18,899 --> 01:13:21,026
Oh, no.

597
01:13:22,694 --> 01:13:25,531
It's impossible.

598
01:13:44,633 --> 01:13:46,718
What is it?

599
01:13:48,262 --> 01:13:50,722
It's my ship.

600
01:13:50,806 --> 01:13:54,268
But these ruins are
thousands of years old.

601
01:13:56,103 --> 01:13:58,772
I was just here a few days ago.

602
01:14:15,455 --> 01:14:18,000
This is what the messenger
was picking up- the Oberon.

603
01:14:27,050 --> 01:14:30,345
What are you doing?

604
01:14:30,429 --> 01:14:34,349
The ship has a nuclear power source
that's supposed to last forever.

605
01:14:36,518 --> 01:14:40,022
Hmph!

606
01:14:45,277 --> 01:14:48,488
If I can access the database,
the ship keeps a visual log.

607
01:14:48,572 --> 01:14:53,368
It's a way for them to tell their own story.
Maybe I can figure out what happened.

608
01:15:00,167 --> 01:15:03,128
Mayday! Mayday! Come in, guidance!

609
01:15:03,212 --> 01:15:05,881
Request instructions.
We're going down!

610
01:15:09,593 --> 01:15:13,764
We were searching for a pilot lost
in an electromagnetic storm.

611
01:15:13,847 --> 01:15:17,935
They couldn't find me because
I got pushed forward through time.

612
01:15:18,018 --> 01:15:22,564
We haven't had any communications
since we crash-landed.

613
01:15:22,648 --> 01:15:26,443
This planet is uncharted
and uninhabited.

614
01:15:27,736 --> 01:15:30,280
The apes we brought along
have been very helpful.

615
01:15:30,364 --> 01:15:33,784
They were a lot stronger
and a lot smarter...

616
01:15:33,867 --> 01:15:36,578
than we ever imagined.

617
01:15:41,208 --> 01:15:45,128
The apes are out of control.

618
01:15:45,212 --> 01:15:47,297
One male named Semos...

619
01:15:47,381 --> 01:15:52,511
who I raised myself
has taken over the group.

620
01:15:52,594 --> 01:15:56,348
We have weapons, but I don't know
how much longer we'll last.

621
01:15:56,431 --> 01:16:00,352
Maybe I saw the truth when they
were young and I wouldn't admit it.

622
01:16:00,435 --> 01:16:02,604
They were good students and...

623
01:16:13,365 --> 01:16:16,118
They're all dead 'cause
they were out looking for me.

624
01:16:20,873 --> 01:16:23,333
We're alive because of you.

625
01:16:45,647 --> 01:16:48,233
Who the hell are they?

626
01:16:48,317 --> 01:16:50,485
Your story is spreading
through the villages.

627
01:16:50,569 --> 01:16:55,115
They all want to see this
human who defies the apes.

628
01:16:55,199 --> 01:16:57,743
- Hell, send them all back.
- Back where?

629
01:16:57,826 --> 01:17:00,704
They left their homes to be with you.

630
01:18:12,776 --> 01:18:15,279
I saw them.

631
01:18:15,362 --> 01:18:18,448
- How many?
- As far as I could see.

632
01:18:20,200 --> 01:18:23,120
Thade has brought all his legions,
which means the senate has capitulated.

633
01:18:24,788 --> 01:18:27,624
He answers to no one now.

634
01:18:32,045 --> 01:18:34,339
Get your people out of here.

635
01:18:34,423 --> 01:18:36,633
Tell them to go to the mountains
and hide while there's a chance.

636
01:18:36,717 --> 01:18:39,678
They won't listen to me.

637
01:18:53,317 --> 01:18:56,195
This is a fight we can't win.

638
01:18:56,278 --> 01:18:59,781
I want you all to break up
and scatter.

639
01:18:59,865 --> 01:19:02,201
I'll draw them off.
I'm the one they want.

640
01:19:02,284 --> 01:19:05,746
All right? Come on!

641
01:19:05,829 --> 01:19:07,748
Let's go.

642
01:19:07,831 --> 01:19:10,167
Let's go!

643
01:19:12,169 --> 01:19:13,837
Come on!

644
01:19:16,131 --> 01:19:18,467
Whoa. Hyah!

645
01:19:24,598 --> 01:19:26,934
You gotta make your people understand.

646
01:19:27,017 --> 01:19:29,978
It's over.
There's no help coming.

647
01:19:36,652 --> 01:19:39,696
You came.

648
01:20:07,266 --> 01:20:10,519
Stop! Come closer
and identify yourself.

649
01:20:14,565 --> 01:20:18,360
How dare you show your face here.

650
01:20:19,444 --> 01:20:22,155
It was not my decision.

651
01:20:29,705 --> 01:20:32,040
I wish to speak to Thade.

652
01:21:11,330 --> 01:21:13,248
Why have you come here?

653
01:21:24,426 --> 01:21:26,637
To be with you.

654
01:21:38,899 --> 01:21:42,069
A trade, is that
what you're proposing?

655
01:21:42,152 --> 01:21:44,112
Yourself for the humans?

656
01:21:47,157 --> 01:21:51,453
Even when you were a child
you took in stray humans.

657
01:21:51,537 --> 01:21:54,122
Your family indulged your every whim.

658
01:21:57,709 --> 01:22:00,337
Now look what you've become.

659
01:22:01,964 --> 01:22:05,843
I've been... mistaken.

660
01:22:08,178 --> 01:22:10,472
Forgive me.

661
01:22:28,365 --> 01:22:30,993
So you want to be human?

662
01:22:38,083 --> 01:22:43,046
Then wear their mark.

663
01:22:47,885 --> 01:22:49,803
Let her return.

664
01:22:49,887 --> 01:22:54,558
She can die with her friends tomorrow.

665
01:23:34,473 --> 01:23:39,978
We were searching for a pilot
lost in an electromagnetic storm.

666
01:23:40,062 --> 01:23:43,732
We haven't had any communication
since we crash-landed.

667
01:23:43,815 --> 01:23:45,734
I'm so sorry.

668
01:23:45,817 --> 01:23:48,153
This planet is uncharted
and uninhabited.

669
01:23:48,237 --> 01:23:50,948
I'm responsible for all of this.

670
01:23:51,031 --> 01:23:53,617
I'm never going home...

671
01:23:55,702 --> 01:23:57,621
just like them.

672
01:24:00,666 --> 01:24:04,086
The apes are out of control.

673
01:24:05,295 --> 01:24:07,256
One male named Semos...

674
01:24:07,339 --> 01:24:11,844
who I raised myself
has taken over the group.

675
01:24:11,927 --> 01:24:15,138
We have weapons, but I don't know
how much longer we'll last.

676
01:24:15,222 --> 01:24:18,892
I can't go home either.

677
01:24:18,976 --> 01:24:21,061
Maybe we're not so different.

678
01:24:22,980 --> 01:24:24,982
No.

679
01:24:25,065 --> 01:24:26,984
We're very different.

680
01:24:29,611 --> 01:24:31,989
You care about everybody but yourself.

681
01:24:33,615 --> 01:24:35,534
It doesn't matter...

682
01:24:35,617 --> 01:24:38,287
apes, humans, my planet, your planet.

683
01:24:38,370 --> 01:24:41,790
The universe seems only
to reward cruelty with power.

684
01:24:43,041 --> 01:24:47,296
No. Not always.

685
01:24:47,379 --> 01:24:49,298
Not if we fight back.

686
01:24:54,887 --> 01:24:56,805
I'm just not sure how.

687
01:25:04,563 --> 01:25:07,357
You better take care of that.

688
01:25:16,825 --> 01:25:19,953
I respect your courage.

689
01:25:20,037 --> 01:25:25,000
But my advice to you
is to put that away...

690
01:25:25,083 --> 01:25:27,669
and head for the mountains.

691
01:26:12,381 --> 01:26:14,633
All right. There's one
possibility, but that's it.

692
01:26:14,716 --> 01:26:17,386
We've gotta draw them in close.

693
01:26:17,469 --> 01:26:20,264
I want those people behind the ship, but
don't hide them. They need to be seen.

694
01:26:20,347 --> 01:26:22,432
What about us?

695
01:26:22,516 --> 01:26:25,519
You're gonna be on horseback in front of the ship.
You're gonna be the bait.

696
01:26:25,602 --> 01:26:28,564
- I won't move till you say so.
- You won't even be out there.

697
01:26:28,647 --> 01:26:30,774
- I can do this as well as anyone else.
- I know you can.

698
01:26:30,858 --> 01:26:33,277
I need you back there with them, okay?

699
01:26:34,570 --> 01:26:36,530
All right.
We've got one shot. Let's go.

700
01:26:41,410 --> 01:26:43,328
All right.
Listen up, everyone.

701
01:26:43,412 --> 01:26:47,082
I've got an idea.
It may give us a chance.

702
01:26:47,165 --> 01:26:49,293
I need everybody to get
back behind the ship.

703
01:26:51,128 --> 01:26:54,506
Hey, we can win this.

704
01:26:54,590 --> 01:26:58,468
It's been done before on my planet.

705
01:26:58,552 --> 01:27:02,014
Look, our history is filled with men
who have done amazing things.

706
01:27:02,097 --> 01:27:04,224
That history belongs to you now.

707
01:27:05,934 --> 01:27:10,522
Listen. Sometimes even a few
can make a difference, okay?

708
01:27:10,606 --> 01:27:13,442
Now, come on.
This is the day you've waited for.

709
01:27:13,525 --> 01:27:15,903
This is the day you get to
stand up to the apes. Let's go!

710
01:27:17,362 --> 01:27:19,281
Leo.

711
01:27:21,950 --> 01:27:26,205
You know you can't
defeat Thade's army.

712
01:27:26,288 --> 01:27:28,415
We might be able
to surprise and confuse them.

713
01:27:28,498 --> 01:27:30,459
Maybe it'll give us a chance.

714
01:27:32,878 --> 01:27:35,339
You don't understand Thade.

715
01:27:35,422 --> 01:27:39,468
He'll keep coming for you
no matter what.

716
01:27:39,551 --> 01:27:41,970
That's kind of what I'm counting on.

717
01:28:24,471 --> 01:28:26,265
Everybody behind the ship.

718
01:28:26,348 --> 01:28:29,351
Get those children behind the ship.

719
01:28:30,936 --> 01:28:33,814
Come on, go.
We gotta go now.

720
01:28:53,083 --> 01:28:55,002
- Let me go with them.
- No.

721
01:28:55,085 --> 01:28:57,629
- Let me prove I can help.
- No, I need you here with me.

722
01:28:57,713 --> 01:29:00,757
Help clear them back.

723
01:29:22,988 --> 01:29:25,949
- What are you doing?
- I'm part of this.

724
01:29:26,033 --> 01:29:29,578
- Get back.
- No! I'm staying.

725
01:29:39,421 --> 01:29:44,259
Send in the first wave.

726
01:29:49,097 --> 01:29:51,141
Here they come.

727
01:29:51,225 --> 01:29:54,102
Now!

728
01:30:05,781 --> 01:30:08,367
Oh, God.

729
01:30:35,269 --> 01:30:38,522
Go on!

730
01:30:56,623 --> 01:30:59,334
Jesus!

731
01:31:04,423 --> 01:31:07,134
Come on.

732
01:31:08,635 --> 01:31:11,138
Come on!

733
01:32:00,187 --> 01:32:02,105
Wait.

734
01:32:22,209 --> 01:32:24,378
Now! Now!

735
01:32:38,934 --> 01:32:42,604
With that weapon,
we cannot defeat them.

736
01:32:56,827 --> 01:33:00,122
I'm tired of this human.

737
01:34:13,570 --> 01:34:17,032
No. Wait!

738
01:35:17,259 --> 01:35:21,305
My fight is with Thade, not you.

739
01:35:21,388 --> 01:35:24,266
Then your fight is with me.

740
01:38:13,810 --> 01:38:19,107
- Semos.
- Semos.

741
01:38:50,722 --> 01:38:54,768
Pericles, that was
a better landing than me.

742
01:38:58,021 --> 01:39:01,024
Sir, the prophesy is true.

743
01:39:01,108 --> 01:39:03,360
Semos has returned to us.

744
01:39:06,029 --> 01:39:07,948
Come on.

745
01:39:08,031 --> 01:39:12,870
Okay. Let's go explain
evolution to the monkeys.

746
01:39:25,966 --> 01:39:28,802
Hey.

747
01:42:31,235 --> 01:42:35,072
He'll turn us all
into slaves. Kill him!

748
01:42:35,155 --> 01:42:40,202
Listen, this is where you're from.
We brought you here.

749
01:42:40,285 --> 01:42:42,663
It's the truth.
We lived in peace together.

750
01:42:42,746 --> 01:42:45,207
It was Semos. He's the one
who killed everybody.

751
01:42:50,712 --> 01:42:52,965
He's lying.

752
01:42:53,048 --> 01:42:56,552
Help me, my friend.

753
01:42:56,635 --> 01:42:58,554
Kill him!

754
01:43:06,478 --> 01:43:09,106
Everything I have believed is a lie.

755
01:43:09,189 --> 01:43:13,443
You and your family have betrayed us.

756
01:43:13,527 --> 01:43:16,780
I won't help you any more.

757
01:43:25,581 --> 01:43:27,499
Ari.

758
01:43:36,425 --> 01:43:38,760
Ari.

759
01:45:18,235 --> 01:45:22,114
You okay?
You came home.

760
01:45:22,197 --> 01:45:25,158
It's safe.
You can come out now.

761
01:45:28,203 --> 01:45:30,122
What, it's over?

762
01:45:30,205 --> 01:45:33,375
I-I was just getting ready
to make my move.

763
01:45:44,178 --> 01:45:47,014
We will leave the graves unmarked.

764
01:45:47,097 --> 01:45:51,185
No one who comes here will
be able to tell apes from humans.

765
01:45:51,268 --> 01:45:53,353
They will be mourned together...

766
01:45:53,437 --> 01:45:57,941
as it should be from now on.

767
01:46:09,828 --> 01:46:12,915
- Take good care of him, okay?
- Yeah.

768
01:46:12,998 --> 01:46:16,710
Well, I can promise you
I won't put him in a cage.

769
01:46:33,560 --> 01:46:37,189
It's found the coordinates
of the storm that brought me here.

770
01:46:37,272 --> 01:46:41,235
You know, it would mean
a great deal to everyone...

771
01:46:41,318 --> 01:46:45,447
if you would stay.

772
01:46:47,741 --> 01:46:49,660
It would mean a great deal to me.

773
01:46:50,869 --> 01:46:52,788
I have to leave now.

774
01:46:52,871 --> 01:46:54,998
I have to take a chance
it'll get me back.

775
01:47:00,337 --> 01:47:03,715
You know, one day
they'll tell a story...

776
01:47:03,799 --> 01:47:07,886
about a human who
came from the stars...

777
01:47:07,970 --> 01:47:09,930
and changed our world.

778
01:47:12,975 --> 01:47:16,436
Some will say
it was just a fairy tale...

779
01:47:16,520 --> 01:47:20,858
that... he was never real.

780
01:47:23,986 --> 01:47:25,988
But I'll know.

781
01:47:47,259 --> 01:47:49,803
- Oh.
- Keep it.

782
01:47:49,887 --> 01:47:53,765
You know, I'd like to thank you...

783
01:47:53,849 --> 01:47:57,603
for opening my eyes
to a brave new world of trade...

784
01:47:57,686 --> 01:47:59,897
with the humans.

785
01:47:59,980 --> 01:48:02,566
Yeah, no problem.

786
01:48:02,649 --> 01:48:04,693
Farewell, spaceman.

787
01:48:04,776 --> 01:48:06,778
All right, kids.

788
01:48:06,862 --> 01:48:10,365
Who wants to buy some aspirin?

789
01:48:20,459 --> 01:48:23,253
Maybe you'll come back.

790
01:50:39,389 --> 01:50:42,434
Z.D.C. air-traffic
control to unidentified aircraft.

791
01:50:42,518 --> 01:50:44,686
Switch your radio
to 121 .5 megahertz.

792
01:50:46,688 --> 01:50:49,233
Z.D.C. to unidentified aircraft.
Do you copy? Over.

793
01:50:49,316 --> 01:50:52,152
Copy that.

794
01:50:52,236 --> 01:50:55,447
Unidentified aircraft, you are
entering restricted airspace.

795
01:50:55,531 --> 01:51:00,160
- Request permission to land.
- You're way off target- way off target. Abort.

796
01:51:00,244 --> 01:51:02,412
I can't!

797
01:52:14,985 --> 01:52:17,446
Let's go. Let's go. Move.

798
01:52:44,640 --> 01:52:46,600
Keep your hands up.

1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,074


2
00:02:26,977 --> 00:02:28,746
Harry, answer that.

3
00:02:31,749 --> 00:02:33,951
So what do you wanna hack for, Bickle?

4
00:02:34,218 --> 00:02:35,619
I can't sleep nights.

5
00:02:35,886 --> 00:02:39,590
-There's porno theaters for that.
-I know. I tried that.

6
00:02:44,361 --> 00:02:45,896
So what do you do now?

7
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:49,967
Now? Ride around nights mostly.
Subways, buses.

8
00:02:50,234 --> 00:02:53,037
Figure I might as well
get paid for it.

9
00:02:53,304 --> 00:02:55,573
You wanna work uptown?
South Bronx, Harlem?

10
00:02:55,773 --> 00:02:57,541
I'll work anytime, anywhere.

11
00:02:57,808 --> 00:02:59,109
Will you work Jewish holidays?

12
00:02:59,443 --> 00:03:01,078
Anytime, anywhere.

13
00:03:01,312 --> 00:03:03,781
Let me see your chauffeur's license.

14
00:03:06,383 --> 00:03:07,551
How's your record?

15
00:03:07,785 --> 00:03:08,819
It's clean.

16
00:03:09,086 --> 00:03:11,088
It's real clean, like my conscience.

17
00:03:11,322 --> 00:03:15,125
You gonna break my chops? I got
enough trouble with guys like you.

18
00:03:15,326 --> 00:03:18,162
If you're gonna, you can
take it on the arches.

19
00:03:18,896 --> 00:03:21,298
Sorry, sir, I didn't mean that.

20
00:03:22,967 --> 00:03:24,668
-Physical?
-Clean.

21
00:03:24,902 --> 00:03:26,670
-Age?
-26.

22
00:03:26,937 --> 00:03:28,606
Education?

23
00:03:29,006 --> 00:03:30,274
Some.

24
00:03:31,509 --> 00:03:32,576
Here, there.

25
00:03:36,413 --> 00:03:37,848
Military record?

26
00:03:38,082 --> 00:03:40,284
Honorable discharge.

27
00:03:40,751 --> 00:03:42,786
May 1973.

28
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:44,989
-Were you in the Army?
-Marines.

29
00:03:47,157 --> 00:03:49,260
I was in the Marines too.

30
00:03:51,829 --> 00:03:53,631
So what is it?

31
00:03:53,931 --> 00:03:55,933
You need an extra job?

32
00:03:56,767 --> 00:03:58,435
Are you moonlighting?

33
00:04:00,037 --> 00:04:02,439
Well, I just wanna work long hours.

34
00:04:02,673 --> 00:04:04,108
What's moonlighting?

35
00:04:04,308 --> 00:04:05,509
Look...

36
00:04:05,776 --> 00:04:08,312
...just fill these out
and check back tomorrow.

37
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:11,448
O'Brien, please step up.

38
00:04:11,649 --> 00:04:14,185
Take the car out
through 58th Street, please.

39
00:04:14,451 --> 00:04:16,220
Because it's crowded on 57th.

40
00:05:11,775 --> 00:05:13,511
May 10th.

41
00:05:13,911 --> 00:05:16,614
Thank God for the rain,
which washed away...

42
00:05:16,847 --> 00:05:19,450
...the garbage and the trash
off the sidewalks.

43
00:05:20,451 --> 00:05:22,253
I'm working long hours now.

44
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:26,257
Six in the afternoon to six
in the morning, sometimes even eight.

45
00:05:26,524 --> 00:05:29,593
Six days a week,
sometimes seven days a week.

46
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:32,730
It's a long hustle,
but it keeps me real busy.

47
00:05:32,963 --> 00:05:35,199
I can take in $300,
$350 a week.

48
00:05:35,432 --> 00:05:37,968
Sometimes even more,
when I do it off the meter.

49
00:06:02,893 --> 00:06:05,429
All the animals come out at night.

50
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:10,668
Whores, skunk-pussies, buggers,
queens, fairies, dopers, junkies.

51
00:06:12,403 --> 00:06:13,838
Sick, venal.

52
00:06:17,107 --> 00:06:21,445
Someday, a real rain will come and
wash all this scum off the streets.

53
00:06:28,819 --> 00:06:33,424
I go all over. I take people to
the Bronx, Brooklyn, Harlem.

54
00:06:33,624 --> 00:06:36,594
I don't care.
Don't make no difference to me.

55
00:06:37,194 --> 00:06:40,364
It does to some.
Some won't even take spooks.

56
00:06:40,631 --> 00:06:42,166
Don't make no difference to me.

57
00:06:42,433 --> 00:06:44,001
48th and 6th, please.

58
00:06:44,201 --> 00:06:48,305
Man, you are gorgeous!
Beautiful little girl.

59
00:06:51,175 --> 00:06:53,110
I can't afford to get stopped.

60
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:55,479
We wouldn't want that to happen.

61
00:06:56,146 --> 00:06:59,383
There'll be a big tip for you
if you do the right things.

62
00:06:59,917 --> 00:07:01,519
You got a way.

63
00:07:01,886 --> 00:07:03,187
You got a way.

64
00:07:04,755 --> 00:07:06,857
Now you're talking!

65
00:07:07,224 --> 00:07:09,560
Driver, hurry up, will you?

66
00:07:47,464 --> 00:07:52,303
Each night when I return the cab,
I clean the come off the back seat.

67
00:07:57,141 --> 00:07:59,610
Some nights, I clean off the blood.

68
00:08:33,077 --> 00:08:34,478
Can I help you?

69
00:08:34,745 --> 00:08:36,747
Yeah, what's your name?

70
00:08:36,947 --> 00:08:38,315
My name is Travis.

71
00:08:38,582 --> 00:08:41,318
That's nice.
What can I do for you?

72
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:45,089
I'd like to know what your name is.

73
00:08:46,624 --> 00:08:47,625
Gimme a break.

74
00:08:47,825 --> 00:08:51,762
You can tell me what your name is.
I'm not gonna do anything.

75
00:08:52,129 --> 00:08:55,533
-Do you want me to call the manager?
-You don't have to--

76
00:08:55,766 --> 00:08:56,700
Troy!

77
00:08:56,934 --> 00:08:59,270
All right. Okay, I mean...

78
00:09:00,838 --> 00:09:03,641
Can I have a Chuckles there?

79
00:09:04,508 --> 00:09:08,946
Do you have any Jujus? They last
longer. I'd like to get them too.

80
00:09:09,146 --> 00:09:11,348
What you see is what we got.

81
00:09:20,157 --> 00:09:21,992
I'll take these.

82
00:09:24,562 --> 00:09:25,830
Coca-Cola.

83
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:29,900
We don't have Coca-Cola.
Royal Crown Cola is all we got.

84
00:09:31,235 --> 00:09:33,237
A dollar eighty-five.

85
00:09:55,392 --> 00:09:58,696
Twelve hours of work
and I still can't sleep.

86
00:09:59,597 --> 00:10:00,831
Damn.

87
00:10:01,065 --> 00:10:05,102
Days go on and on.
And they don't end.

88
00:10:06,604 --> 00:10:10,007
All my life needed was
a sense of someplace to go.

89
00:10:10,241 --> 00:10:14,578
I don't believe that one should devote
his life to morbid self-attention.

90
00:10:14,845 --> 00:10:18,115
I believe someone should
become a person like other people.

91
00:10:21,051 --> 00:10:25,422
I first saw her at Palantine campaign
headquarters at 63rd and Broadway.

92
00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:29,393
She was wearing a white dress.

93
00:10:29,727 --> 00:10:32,062
She appeared like an angel...

94
00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:35,199
...out of this filthy mass.

95
00:10:35,432 --> 00:10:37,268
She is alone.

96
00:10:38,602 --> 00:10:39,970
They...

97
00:10:40,471 --> 00:10:41,872
...cannot...

98
00:10:42,439 --> 00:10:43,741
...touch...

99
00:10:44,575 --> 00:10:45,809
...her.

100
00:10:58,322 --> 00:11:03,160
You delivered two boxes. I think
it's a total of 5000 campaign buttons.

101
00:11:03,427 --> 00:11:06,730
Now, all the ones we had before
and our slogan is...

102
00:11:06,964 --> 00:11:09,633
..."We are the people,"
and "are" is underlined.

103
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:12,336
These new buttons have "we" underlined.

104
00:11:12,603 --> 00:11:17,141
That reads, "_We_ are the people."
Well, I think there's a difference.

105
00:11:17,341 --> 00:11:21,278
"_We_ are the people" is not
the same as "We _are_ the people."

106
00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:23,581
Let's not fight.

107
00:11:24,281 --> 00:11:26,483
Look, we'll make it real simple.

108
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:28,819
We don't pay for the buttons.

109
00:11:29,053 --> 00:11:33,357
-We throw the buttons away, all right?
-Tom, come here a minute.

110
00:11:34,892 --> 00:11:36,293
What?

111
00:11:44,068 --> 00:11:48,572
If Andy okays this canvass report,
send a copy to all headquarters.

112
00:11:48,806 --> 00:11:51,075
I gotta xerox that
New York Times article.

113
00:11:51,342 --> 00:11:53,844
-Don't forget the new photos.
-I didn't.

114
00:11:54,044 --> 00:11:58,315
We have to emphasize mandatory welfare.
That's the issue to push.

115
00:11:58,516 --> 00:12:00,384
First push the man, then the issue.

116
00:12:00,584 --> 00:12:02,586
Senator Palantine is a dynamic man.

117
00:12:02,853 --> 00:12:05,856
An intelligent, interesting,
fresh, fascinating man.

118
00:12:06,056 --> 00:12:07,224
You forgot sexy.

119
00:12:07,424 --> 00:12:08,826
I did not forget sexy.

120
00:12:09,059 --> 00:12:11,662
You sound like
you're selling mouthwash.

121
00:12:11,862 --> 00:12:12,897
We are selling it.

122
00:12:13,164 --> 00:12:15,332
-Are we authorized to do that?
-Very funny.

123
00:12:15,533 --> 00:12:18,569
You can get in trouble
selling pharmaceuticals here.

124
00:12:18,769 --> 00:12:21,338
My uncle's in jail because of that.

125
00:12:21,939 --> 00:12:25,676
It's not really jail. Of course,
with his wife, anything would be jail.

126
00:12:25,876 --> 00:12:27,178
Look over there.

127
00:12:27,411 --> 00:12:28,612
I love you.

128
00:12:28,846 --> 00:12:29,947
Notice anything?

129
00:12:30,181 --> 00:12:32,383
-No.
-Well, put your glasses on.

130
00:12:32,616 --> 00:12:35,186
Okay, just a minute. All right.

131
00:12:35,386 --> 00:12:37,688
That taxi driver's been staring at us.

132
00:12:47,198 --> 00:12:48,232
What taxi driver?

133
00:12:48,465 --> 00:12:50,568
The one that's sitting there.

134
00:12:50,801 --> 00:12:54,138
-How long has he been there?
-It feels like a long time.

135
00:12:54,905 --> 00:12:57,208
-Does he bother you?
-No.

136
00:12:57,474 --> 00:12:59,476
You mean yes.
You're being sarcastic.

137
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:01,579
You're quick.
You're really quick.

138
00:13:01,779 --> 00:13:03,314
I try to be real quick.

139
00:13:03,581 --> 00:13:05,783
I'll play the male
in this relationship--

140
00:13:05,983 --> 00:13:07,251
Good luck.

141
00:13:07,485 --> 00:13:10,788
--and tell him to move.
And I don't need good luck.

142
00:13:11,055 --> 00:13:13,757
Oh yes, you do.
You just think you don't.

143
00:13:21,899 --> 00:13:25,769
You're blocking our doorway.
You think you might move your cab?

144
00:15:06,504 --> 00:15:09,206
You know, eye shadow, mascara...

145
00:15:09,673 --> 00:15:10,908
...lipstick, rouge.

146
00:15:11,175 --> 00:15:14,011
Not rouge. Blush-on, they call it.

147
00:15:14,912 --> 00:15:18,582
-The kind with the brush.
-Yeah, it's Blush-on.

148
00:15:21,919 --> 00:15:25,456
-Hey, Wiz.
-That's Blush-on. My wife uses it.

149
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:27,758
Ask Travis. He's a ladies' man.

150
00:15:29,059 --> 00:15:30,394
A cup of coffee.

151
00:15:30,594 --> 00:15:33,397
Whatever the fuck it is,
she uses a lot of it.

152
00:15:33,597 --> 00:15:36,033
And then perfume. The spray kind.

153
00:15:36,267 --> 00:15:38,736
Then in the middle of
the Triboro Bridge--

154
00:15:38,936 --> 00:15:42,139
And this woman is beautiful,
she changes her pantyhose.

155
00:15:42,406 --> 00:15:43,641
-No.
-Oh, yeah.

156
00:15:43,874 --> 00:15:44,742
What'd you do?

157
00:15:45,242 --> 00:15:49,146
I throw the man out, and I jump
in the back seat and whip it out.

158
00:15:49,413 --> 00:15:51,549
And I said, "You know what this is?"

159
00:15:52,216 --> 00:15:54,552
She says, "It's love."
I fuck her brains out.

160
00:15:54,752 --> 00:15:59,290
She goes wild and says, "That's the
greatest single experience of my life."

161
00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:03,027
Then she gave me a $200 tip
and her phone number in Acapulco.

162
00:16:04,495 --> 00:16:06,530
You know Doughboy, Charlie T.

163
00:16:08,499 --> 00:16:10,968
Hey, Travis.
Got change for a nickel?

164
00:16:11,168 --> 00:16:13,537
Doughboy will do anything for a buck.

165
00:16:16,006 --> 00:16:17,808
So how's it hanging?

166
00:16:22,046 --> 00:16:23,447
What's that?

167
00:16:26,116 --> 00:16:30,321
I turn on the radio. Some fleet driver
from Bell just got all cut up.

168
00:16:30,554 --> 00:16:31,555
Stickup?

169
00:16:31,789 --> 00:16:35,526
No, he got cut up by some crazy fucker.
Cut half his ear off.

170
00:16:35,726 --> 00:16:36,627
Where?

171
00:16:36,827 --> 00:16:39,363
It was on 122nd Street.

172
00:16:40,731 --> 00:16:41,966
Fucking Mau Mau land.

173
00:16:45,669 --> 00:16:48,239
You run all over town,
don't you, Travis?

174
00:16:57,915 --> 00:17:00,151
You run all over town, don't you?

175
00:17:00,818 --> 00:17:03,187
You handle
some pretty rough customers.

176
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:04,922
Yeah, I have.

177
00:17:05,422 --> 00:17:07,024
You carry a piece?

178
00:17:08,659 --> 00:17:10,161
You need one?

179
00:17:11,228 --> 00:17:14,098
I know a fella who can get you
a real nice deal.

180
00:17:14,365 --> 00:17:16,200
Lots of shit around.

181
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,869
I never use mine. I'm conservative.

182
00:17:20,337 --> 00:17:22,940
But it's a good thing to have
just as a threat.

183
00:17:34,018 --> 00:17:36,220
I'm gonna go dig my dirt.

184
00:17:40,591 --> 00:17:41,859
Look.

185
00:17:42,726 --> 00:17:45,196
Piece of Errol Flynn's bathtub.

186
00:17:45,896 --> 00:17:47,298
Dig the symbols.

187
00:17:47,565 --> 00:17:51,368
F-4-0-5-4-3-4.

188
00:17:52,536 --> 00:17:54,371
And the watermark.

189
00:17:54,572 --> 00:17:56,273
There's one person...

190
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:58,142
...there's two persons...

191
00:17:58,375 --> 00:17:59,977
...and there's three persons.

192
00:18:00,244 --> 00:18:02,279
I got this at his estate, The Pines.

193
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:06,450
Take it, and if you can sell it,
you give me half of what you got.

194
00:18:07,051 --> 00:18:08,752
I don't want to.

195
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:11,655
I'm gonna get in my cab and boogie.

196
00:18:26,737 --> 00:18:29,106
Oh, I'm so terribly sorry.

197
00:18:30,107 --> 00:18:30,975
Nothing.

198
00:18:31,175 --> 00:18:33,144
That's very cute. Thank you.

199
00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:35,246
Hey, you wanna see something?

200
00:18:36,013 --> 00:18:38,983
Wait, I just typed,
"You wanna see something?"

201
00:18:41,018 --> 00:18:44,455
If you had these three fingers
missing on this hand...

202
00:18:44,655 --> 00:18:46,924
...and that hand missing
on that hand...

203
00:18:47,958 --> 00:18:50,794
-...how would you light the match?
-I wouldn't.

204
00:18:51,162 --> 00:18:53,164
Go ahead. Give it a try.

205
00:18:54,999 --> 00:18:57,134
Well, I don't think I could do it.

206
00:18:57,368 --> 00:18:58,636
No?

207
00:18:58,869 --> 00:19:00,504
It's gonna be difficult.

208
00:19:00,938 --> 00:19:02,540
I'll give it a try.

209
00:19:10,314 --> 00:19:13,384
I got my thumb back for a second.
Thank God.

210
00:19:14,685 --> 00:19:16,120
Just a minute.

211
00:19:23,894 --> 00:19:25,162
I can't do it.

212
00:19:25,663 --> 00:19:27,398
The guy at the newsstand can.

213
00:19:27,631 --> 00:19:29,667
Well, I don't work at a newsstand.

214
00:19:31,202 --> 00:19:32,903
-Anyway, he's probably ltalian.
-No.

215
00:19:33,170 --> 00:19:34,705
-You're sure?
-He's black.

216
00:19:34,905 --> 00:19:38,242
If he had been ltalian,
he might've been a thief.

217
00:19:38,509 --> 00:19:42,079
If a thief screws up on the job,
the mob blows his fingers off.

218
00:19:42,413 --> 00:19:44,849
This sounds like a joke,
but it's true.

219
00:19:45,049 --> 00:19:48,219
If they kill a stool pigeon,
they leave a canary on the body.

220
00:19:48,419 --> 00:19:51,722
-It's symbolic.
-Why not a pigeon instead of a canary?

221
00:19:51,922 --> 00:19:54,658
I don't know why not.
Wait a minute.

222
00:19:54,859 --> 00:19:58,729
You gotta catch a pigeon. A canary,
you can walk into a pet store...

223
00:19:58,929 --> 00:20:01,732
...kill it right there.
Put it on anyone you want.

224
00:20:28,626 --> 00:20:32,062
-I'd like to volunteer.
-I'll take you right over here.

225
00:20:32,296 --> 00:20:34,932
I'd rather volunteer to her,
if you don't mind.

226
00:20:38,769 --> 00:20:41,005
Why do you have to volunteer to me?

227
00:20:41,238 --> 00:20:45,342
Because you are the most beautiful
woman I have ever seen.

228
00:20:47,945 --> 00:20:49,146
Thanks.

229
00:20:49,413 --> 00:20:51,615
But what do you think of Palantine?

230
00:20:57,121 --> 00:21:00,291
The man you're volunteering
to help elect President.

231
00:21:02,092 --> 00:21:07,097
I don't know what his policies are,
but I'm sure he'll make a good one.

232
00:21:08,966 --> 00:21:11,368
-Do you want to canvass?
-Yeah, I'll canvass.

233
00:21:11,669 --> 00:21:14,171
How do you feel about
his stand on welfare?

234
00:21:14,371 --> 00:21:18,843
I don't really know his stand on
welfare, but I'm sure it's a good stand.

235
00:21:19,109 --> 00:21:20,611
You're sure of that?

236
00:21:24,348 --> 00:21:26,650
We all work together here,
day and night...

237
00:21:26,884 --> 00:21:30,020
...so I'm sure the gentlemen
will sign you up over there.

238
00:21:30,287 --> 00:21:34,792
The thing is, I drive a taxi at night,
so it's kind of hard for me...

239
00:21:35,025 --> 00:21:37,161
...to work in the day.

240
00:21:38,696 --> 00:21:40,397
Then what exactly do you want?

241
00:21:40,631 --> 00:21:43,367
Would you like to have
coffee and pie with me?

242
00:21:43,567 --> 00:21:44,835
Why?

243
00:21:45,069 --> 00:21:47,238
Why? I'll tell you why.

244
00:21:48,839 --> 00:21:50,541
I think you're a lonely person.

245
00:21:51,075 --> 00:21:53,377
I drive by a lot, and I see you here.

246
00:21:53,577 --> 00:21:55,579
I see a lot of people around you...

247
00:21:55,813 --> 00:21:58,883
...and I see these phones
and all this stuff on your desk...

248
00:21:59,083 --> 00:22:00,417
...and it means nothing.

249
00:22:00,684 --> 00:22:02,753
And when I came inside and met you...

250
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:05,723
...I saw in your eyes
and how you carried yourself...

251
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:08,159
...that you're not a happy person.

252
00:22:08,759 --> 00:22:10,528
And I think you need something.

253
00:22:10,728 --> 00:22:13,597
If you wanna call it a friend,
you can call it that.

254
00:22:14,398 --> 00:22:16,700
You're gonna be my friend?

255
00:22:25,843 --> 00:22:27,344
What do you say?

256
00:22:31,515 --> 00:22:35,186
It's a little hard standing here
and asking you, so....

257
00:22:39,456 --> 00:22:43,127
Five minutes, that's all.
Just outside. Right around here.

258
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,062
I'm there to protect you.

259
00:22:51,135 --> 00:22:53,404
Come on. Just take a little break.

260
00:22:56,307 --> 00:22:58,642
I have a break at 4:00.
If you're here--

261
00:22:58,909 --> 00:22:59,944
4:00 today?

262
00:23:01,111 --> 00:23:04,048
-I'll be here.
-I'm sure you will.

263
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:07,151
-All right. Four p.m.
-Right.

264
00:23:07,751 --> 00:23:10,087
-Outside in the front?
-Yes.

265
00:23:10,788 --> 00:23:13,257
Oh, my name is Travis. Betsy?

266
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:18,829
I appreciate this, Betsy.

267
00:23:33,511 --> 00:23:35,779
May 26th, four o'clock p.m.

268
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:39,917
I took Betsy to Charles' Coffee Shop
on Columbus Circle.

269
00:23:40,951 --> 00:23:45,523
I had black coffee and apple pie
with a slice of melted yellow cheese.

270
00:23:45,756 --> 00:23:47,992
I think that was a good selection.

271
00:23:48,192 --> 00:23:50,528
Betsy had coffee
and a fruit salad dish.

272
00:23:50,761 --> 00:23:52,663
She could've had
anything she wanted.

273
00:23:52,863 --> 00:23:55,599
15,000 volunteers
in New York alone isn't bad.

274
00:23:55,833 --> 00:23:57,635
But the organizational problems!

275
00:23:59,703 --> 00:24:02,773
Yeah, I know what you mean.
I got the same problems.

276
00:24:03,007 --> 00:24:08,045
I gotta get organized. Little things,
like my apartment, my possessions.

277
00:24:08,846 --> 00:24:12,683
I should get a sign: "One of
these days, I'll get organiz-ized."

278
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:14,552
You mean "organized"?

279
00:24:14,785 --> 00:24:16,654
Organiz-ized.

280
00:24:16,887 --> 00:24:19,323
Organiz-ized. It's a joke.

281
00:24:20,191 --> 00:24:22,793
O-R-G-A-N-E-Z-I-E-Z-D.

282
00:24:23,027 --> 00:24:27,298
You mean "organiz-ized." Like those
signs in offices that say, "Thimk."

283
00:24:33,471 --> 00:24:34,872
Do you like where you work?

284
00:24:36,307 --> 00:24:40,211
We've got some good people.
Palantine's got a good chance.

285
00:24:44,348 --> 00:24:46,417
You know you have beautiful eyes?

286
00:24:53,023 --> 00:24:55,092
Do you like the guy you work with?

287
00:24:55,359 --> 00:24:56,927
He's okay.

288
00:24:58,796 --> 00:25:00,197
But do you like him?

289
00:25:00,698 --> 00:25:05,136
He's funny and very good at his job.
Though he does have a few problems.

290
00:25:05,369 --> 00:25:07,538
I'd say he has quite a few problems.

291
00:25:09,273 --> 00:25:12,309
His energy seems to go
in the wrong places.

292
00:25:12,943 --> 00:25:15,746
When I walked in and I saw
you two sitting there...

293
00:25:15,946 --> 00:25:18,816
...I could just tell
that there was no connection...

294
00:25:19,049 --> 00:25:20,417
...whatsoever.

295
00:25:20,651 --> 00:25:23,888
And when I walked in,
there was something between us.

296
00:25:24,121 --> 00:25:26,790
There was an impulse
we were both following.

297
00:25:27,057 --> 00:25:29,727
So that gave me the right
to talk to you.

298
00:25:29,927 --> 00:25:33,664
Otherwise, I never would've
had the right to talk to you.

299
00:25:33,931 --> 00:25:36,901
I never would've had
the courage to talk to you.

300
00:25:37,802 --> 00:25:40,271
And with him,
I felt there was nothing.

301
00:25:40,471 --> 00:25:43,574
When I walked in, I knew I was right.
Did you feel that way?

302
00:25:47,144 --> 00:25:49,446
I wouldn't be here if I didn't.

303
00:25:51,782 --> 00:25:53,017
Where are you from?

304
00:25:53,818 --> 00:25:54,752
Upstate.

305
00:25:58,823 --> 00:26:00,457
That fellow, I don't like him.

306
00:26:00,658 --> 00:26:03,661
Not that I don't like him,
I just think he's silly.

307
00:26:06,130 --> 00:26:08,365
I don't think he respects you.

308
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:12,636
I don't believe I've ever met
anyone quite like you.

309
00:26:23,981 --> 00:26:25,683
You wanna go to...

310
00:26:27,017 --> 00:26:28,686
...a movie with me?

311
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:33,190
-I have to go back to work now.
-I don't mean now. Another time?

312
00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:42,166
Sure. You know what you remind me of?

313
00:26:43,067 --> 00:26:44,034
What?

314
00:26:44,301 --> 00:26:45,503
That song...

315
00:26:46,804 --> 00:26:49,740
...by Kris Kristofferson.

316
00:26:52,376 --> 00:26:53,210
Who's that?

317
00:26:53,677 --> 00:26:55,346
The songwriter.

318
00:26:55,546 --> 00:26:57,081
"He's a prophet....

319
00:26:57,348 --> 00:26:59,049
He's a prophet and a pusher...

320
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:03,320
...partly truth, partly fiction,
a walking contradiction."

321
00:27:04,989 --> 00:27:06,390
You saying that about me?

322
00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:08,325
Who else would I be talking about?

323
00:27:08,893 --> 00:27:10,594
I'm no pusher.
I've never pushed.

324
00:27:12,062 --> 00:27:14,532
Just the part about the contradictions.

325
00:27:14,765 --> 00:27:16,567
You are that.

326
00:27:47,198 --> 00:27:50,968
I called Betsy again. She said
maybe we'd go to a movie...

327
00:27:51,202 --> 00:27:54,104
...after work tomorrow.
That's my day off.

328
00:27:54,371 --> 00:27:58,476
At first she hesitated,
but I called her again and she agreed.

329
00:27:59,977 --> 00:28:01,645
Betsy, Betsy. Oh, no.

330
00:28:01,912 --> 00:28:04,582
Betsy what?
I forgot to ask her last name.

331
00:28:04,782 --> 00:28:08,085
Damn! I gotta remember
stuff like that.

332
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:21,932
Don't worry about anyone
committing themselves...

333
00:28:22,133 --> 00:28:24,802
...until things come in
from California.

334
00:28:25,069 --> 00:28:27,938
Listen, I think we should've
waited for the limo.

335
00:28:28,172 --> 00:28:30,141
I don't mind the cab,
but I mind...

336
00:28:30,341 --> 00:28:33,777
...going to California
without the right preparation.

337
00:28:33,978 --> 00:28:36,180
Are you Charles Palantine,
the candidate?

338
00:28:37,982 --> 00:28:39,817
Yes, I am.

339
00:28:41,185 --> 00:28:46,123
I tell everybody that comes in this taxi
that they have to vote for you.

340
00:28:46,524 --> 00:28:47,925
Why, thank you...

341
00:28:49,994 --> 00:28:50,828
...Travis.

342
00:28:51,095 --> 00:28:54,165
I'm sure you'll win.
Everybody I know will vote for you.

343
00:28:54,365 --> 00:28:56,801
I was gonna put your sticker
in my taxi...

344
00:28:57,034 --> 00:28:59,937
...but the company said
it was against their policy.

345
00:29:00,137 --> 00:29:01,772
They're a bunch of jerks.

346
00:29:01,972 --> 00:29:04,809
Let me tell you, I have learned
more about America...

347
00:29:05,009 --> 00:29:08,212
...from riding in cabs than in all
the limos in the U.S.

348
00:29:10,114 --> 00:29:12,950
-Oh, yeah?
-That's true.

349
00:29:13,450 --> 00:29:15,986
-Can I ask you something, Travis?
-Sure.

350
00:29:16,187 --> 00:29:19,356
What bugs you the most
about this country?

351
00:29:21,058 --> 00:29:25,863
Well, I don't know. I don't follow
political issues that closely, sir.

352
00:29:26,497 --> 00:29:28,566
Well, there must be something.

353
00:29:28,866 --> 00:29:32,937
Well, whatever it is, he should
clean up this city here...

354
00:29:33,170 --> 00:29:37,675
...because it's like an open sewer.
It's full of filth and scum.

355
00:29:38,108 --> 00:29:39,944
Sometimes I can hardly take it.

356
00:29:40,211 --> 00:29:43,180
Whatever becomes the President
should just...

357
00:29:43,881 --> 00:29:45,916
...really clean it up. You know?

358
00:29:46,183 --> 00:29:49,787
Sometimes I go out and I smell it.
I get headaches, it's so bad.

359
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:53,090
And they just never go away, you know?

360
00:29:53,357 --> 00:29:55,693
I think that the President
should just...

361
00:29:56,193 --> 00:30:00,698
...clean up this mess. He should
flush it right down the fucking toilet.

362
00:30:08,772 --> 00:30:11,308
I think I know what you mean, Travis.

363
00:30:11,742 --> 00:30:13,577
But it's not gonna be easy.

364
00:30:13,777 --> 00:30:17,248
-We'll have to make radical changes.
-Damn straight.

365
00:30:18,916 --> 00:30:20,651
Here you go.
Keep the change.

366
00:30:20,885 --> 00:30:22,153
Thank you.

367
00:30:25,656 --> 00:30:27,725
-Nice talking to you.
-Nice talking to you.

368
00:30:27,958 --> 00:30:30,294
You're a good man.
I know you're gonna win.

369
00:30:30,661 --> 00:30:32,496
Thank you, I think.

370
00:30:55,186 --> 00:30:57,621
Just get me outta here,
all right?

371
00:31:01,025 --> 00:31:02,827
Come on!

372
00:31:03,627 --> 00:31:05,329
Come on, baby.
This is a real drag.

373
00:31:05,596 --> 00:31:08,165
Now, come on!
Don't make a scene.

374
00:31:09,934 --> 00:31:11,268
You wanna get busted?

375
00:31:11,469 --> 00:31:12,770
Bitch, be cool!

376
00:31:21,946 --> 00:31:23,714
Don't start no trouble.

377
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:26,884
Cabbie, just forget about this.

378
00:31:27,351 --> 00:31:28,352
Be cool, bitch!

379
00:32:22,606 --> 00:32:24,542
Get your ass out of here!

380
00:33:33,511 --> 00:33:34,912
Hi there.

381
00:33:36,847 --> 00:33:39,483
-Have a nice day today?
-Not particularly.

382
00:33:39,683 --> 00:33:41,352
Got a present for you.

383
00:33:45,623 --> 00:33:49,293
Now back to Gene Krupa's
syncopated style shortly.

384
00:33:57,401 --> 00:33:58,669
Why'd you do that?

385
00:33:58,869 --> 00:34:01,806
What else am I gonna do
with my money?

386
00:34:02,173 --> 00:34:04,308
I wish you'd have listened to this.

387
00:34:04,875 --> 00:34:07,878
I would have, except my record
player doesn't work now.

388
00:34:08,145 --> 00:34:09,346
Your stereo's broken?

389
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:12,016
How do you stand it?
I can't live without music.

390
00:34:12,249 --> 00:34:15,886
I don't follow music too much,
but I would really like to.

391
00:34:16,153 --> 00:34:18,689
Then you haven't played
this record yet.

392
00:34:20,424 --> 00:34:25,196
But I was thinking maybe we could
listen to it on your record player.

393
00:34:25,429 --> 00:34:29,099
Now, going back through
40 years of Chick Webb.

394
00:34:45,349 --> 00:34:46,884
You gotta be kidding.

395
00:34:47,084 --> 00:34:48,052
What?

396
00:34:48,252 --> 00:34:50,387
This is a dirty movie.

397
00:34:50,955 --> 00:34:54,792
No, no. This is a movie
that a lot of couples come to.

398
00:34:55,025 --> 00:34:58,929
-All kinds of couples go here.
-You sure about that?

399
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:01,866
Yeah, I see them all the time.

400
00:35:05,136 --> 00:35:06,237
Come on.

401
00:35:48,679 --> 00:35:50,915
-Where are you going?
-I have to leave.

402
00:35:51,148 --> 00:35:53,417
-Why?
-I don't know why I came in here.

403
00:35:53,651 --> 00:35:55,920
-I don't like these movies.
-Well, I mean--

404
00:35:56,153 --> 00:35:59,023
I didn't know you'd feel
that way about this movie.

405
00:35:59,290 --> 00:36:02,159
-If I had--
-Are these the only movies you go to?

406
00:36:02,426 --> 00:36:05,362
Yeah, I mean I come and--
This is not so bad.

407
00:36:05,629 --> 00:36:09,433
Taking me here is as exciting
to me as saying, "Let's fuck."

408
00:36:13,871 --> 00:36:16,273
There are other movies
I can take you to.

409
00:36:16,474 --> 00:36:19,777
I don't know much about them,
but I can take you other places.

410
00:36:20,211 --> 00:36:21,779
We're just different.

411
00:36:22,313 --> 00:36:24,548
-Wait a second.
-I have to go.

412
00:36:24,782 --> 00:36:25,983
I've got to go now.

413
00:36:26,183 --> 00:36:29,820
-Wait a second, I want to talk.
-But I have to go.

414
00:36:30,454 --> 00:36:31,522
Taxi!

415
00:36:31,789 --> 00:36:36,026
Can I talk to you at least?
Won't you at least to talk to me?

416
00:36:36,293 --> 00:36:37,461
Take the record.

417
00:36:37,661 --> 00:36:39,997
-I've already got it.
-But, please.

418
00:36:40,231 --> 00:36:44,201
-I bought it for you, Betsy.
-Okay, now I've got two. Let's go.

419
00:36:44,401 --> 00:36:46,137
Can I call you?

420
00:36:47,338 --> 00:36:49,473
Jesus Christ, I got a taxi.

421
00:36:55,379 --> 00:36:56,914
Hello, Betsy.

422
00:36:57,148 --> 00:36:58,849
Hi, it's Travis.

423
00:37:00,718 --> 00:37:03,687
Listen, I'm sorry
about the other night.

424
00:37:03,921 --> 00:37:06,991
I didn't know that was
the way you felt about it.

425
00:37:08,859 --> 00:37:13,864
Well, I didn't know. If I--
I'd have taken you somewhere else.

426
00:37:15,099 --> 00:37:17,201
Are you feeling better or...?

427
00:37:18,102 --> 00:37:21,772
Maybe you had a virus or something.
A 24-hour virus, you know.

428
00:37:22,039 --> 00:37:24,275
It can happen. Yeah.

429
00:37:29,046 --> 00:37:31,582
You've been working hard, huh?

430
00:37:35,619 --> 00:37:38,923
Would you like to have
some dinner with me...

431
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:41,792
...in the next few days or something?

432
00:37:44,795 --> 00:37:46,430
How about a cup of coffee?

433
00:37:46,697 --> 00:37:50,768
I could come by the headquarters
or something, and we could....

434
00:37:51,635 --> 00:37:53,471
Okay, okay.

435
00:37:56,073 --> 00:37:58,709
Did you get my flowers and the...?

436
00:38:00,611 --> 00:38:04,949
You didn't get them?
But I sent some flowers.

437
00:38:11,388 --> 00:38:13,491
Can I call you again?

438
00:38:13,924 --> 00:38:15,993
Tomorrow or the next day?

439
00:38:16,627 --> 00:38:19,563
No, I'm gonna--
Okay, yeah, sure.

440
00:38:19,830 --> 00:38:21,232
So long.

441
00:38:23,601 --> 00:38:25,803
I tried several times to call her...

442
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:29,540
...but after the first call,
she wouldn't come to the phone.

443
00:38:30,007 --> 00:38:32,376
I also sent flowers,
but with no luck.

444
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:35,212
The smell of the flowers
made me sicker.

445
00:38:35,479 --> 00:38:39,984
The headaches got worse.
I think I got stomach cancer.

446
00:38:40,618 --> 00:38:42,686
I shouldn't complain, though.

447
00:38:43,187 --> 00:38:45,189
You're only as healthy....

448
00:38:46,056 --> 00:38:48,526
You're only as healthy as you feel.

449
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:51,228
You're only...

450
00:38:51,495 --> 00:38:53,164
...as healthy...

451
00:38:53,397 --> 00:38:54,799
...as...

452
00:38:55,032 --> 00:38:56,567
...you...

453
00:38:56,834 --> 00:38:58,169
...feel.

454
00:39:08,546 --> 00:39:12,149
-Let's not have trouble.
-Why won't you talk to me?

455
00:39:12,349 --> 00:39:14,819
You think I don't know you're here?

456
00:39:15,052 --> 00:39:17,054
You think I don't know?

457
00:39:17,254 --> 00:39:18,923
-Please leave.
-Take your hands off!

458
00:39:19,156 --> 00:39:21,325
I just want you to know--

459
00:39:21,525 --> 00:39:24,595
Please.
This is no place to do this.

460
00:39:25,396 --> 00:39:27,164
-Take your hands off!
-Just leave.

461
00:39:27,398 --> 00:39:30,701
-All right, leave, then!
-I wanna tell you...

462
00:39:30,935 --> 00:39:33,337
...you're in hell!
And you'll die in hell.

463
00:39:33,537 --> 00:39:36,273
-There's a cop over there.
-You're like the rest of them.

464
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:38,843
Look, I'm calling the cop.
Officer!

465
00:39:41,779 --> 00:39:43,214
Officer!

466
00:39:44,849 --> 00:39:48,185
Don't come around here,
because I'll call the police!

467
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:54,225
I realize now, how much she's just
like the others, cold and distant.

468
00:39:54,425 --> 00:39:56,093
Many people are like that.

469
00:39:56,293 --> 00:39:59,597
Women for sure.
They're like a union.

470
00:40:00,898 --> 00:40:02,366
Yo, cabbie!

471
00:40:10,141 --> 00:40:14,044
Pull over to the curb over there.
Right over there.

472
00:40:16,046 --> 00:40:16,881
No, don't.

473
00:40:18,282 --> 00:40:20,718
The fucking meter.
What are you doing?

474
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:22,953
What are you doing with the meter?

475
00:40:23,154 --> 00:40:26,323
Did I tell you to do that
with the meter?

476
00:40:26,557 --> 00:40:30,427
Put the meter back.
I don't care what I have to pay.

477
00:40:30,661 --> 00:40:34,298
I'm not getting out.
Put the meter back on.

478
00:40:34,565 --> 00:40:35,499
Put it down.

479
00:40:36,934 --> 00:40:37,835
That's right.

480
00:40:38,102 --> 00:40:39,904
Put it down!

481
00:40:41,639 --> 00:40:43,007
That's right.

482
00:40:43,908 --> 00:40:46,410
Why are you writing?
Don't write!

483
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:48,112
Put the thing down.
Just sit.

484
00:40:51,615 --> 00:40:54,685
I didn't tell you to write.
I just said, "Pull over."

485
00:40:54,952 --> 00:40:57,421
Pull over to the curb and sit here.

486
00:40:59,490 --> 00:41:00,958
We're gonna sit.

487
00:41:19,677 --> 00:41:23,681
Cabbie, you see that light up there?
In the window?

488
00:41:25,149 --> 00:41:27,518
The light?
The window in the second floor.

489
00:41:30,855 --> 00:41:34,125
The one that's closest
to the edge of the building.

490
00:41:35,226 --> 00:41:38,696
The light up in the window.
Second story.

491
00:41:40,364 --> 00:41:42,066
What are you, blind?

492
00:41:42,299 --> 00:41:43,901
Do you see the light?

493
00:41:45,636 --> 00:41:47,671
Yeah, you see it. Good.

494
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:50,975
See the woman?

495
00:41:53,577 --> 00:41:56,313
Do you see the woman in the window?

496
00:41:58,349 --> 00:41:59,183
Yeah.

497
00:42:01,652 --> 00:42:04,555
I want you to see that woman
because that's my wife.

498
00:42:07,091 --> 00:42:08,926
But that's not my apartment.

499
00:42:11,896 --> 00:42:14,565
It's not my apartment.
You know who lives there?

500
00:42:15,566 --> 00:42:19,170
No, you wouldn't know.
But you know who lives there?

501
00:42:20,504 --> 00:42:22,072
A nigger lives there.

502
00:42:22,273 --> 00:42:24,175
How do you like that?

503
00:42:31,348 --> 00:42:33,350
And I'm gonna kill her.

504
00:42:35,686 --> 00:42:38,422
There's nothing else.
I'm gonna kill her.

505
00:42:38,622 --> 00:42:40,624
What do you think of that?

506
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:44,595
I said, "What do you think of that?"

507
00:42:45,095 --> 00:42:46,530
Don't answer.

508
00:42:46,897 --> 00:42:48,966
You don't have to answer everything.

509
00:42:53,103 --> 00:42:55,906
I'm gonna kill her
with a .44 Magnum pistol.

510
00:42:56,774 --> 00:43:00,644
I have a .44 Magnum pistol.
I'm gonna kill her with that gun.

511
00:43:01,145 --> 00:43:04,849
Did you ever see what a .44 Magnum
can do to a woman's face?

512
00:43:05,116 --> 00:43:08,786
It'd fucking destroy it.
Just blow it right apart.

513
00:43:09,019 --> 00:43:11,288
That's what it can do to a face.

514
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:14,758
Did you ever see what
it can do to a woman's pussy?

515
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:19,830
You should see what a .44 Magnum's
gonna do to a woman's pussy.

516
00:43:27,004 --> 00:43:28,105
What's that?

517
00:43:28,372 --> 00:43:31,308
I know you must think
that I'm, you know....

518
00:43:31,509 --> 00:43:35,279
You must think
I'm pretty sick or something.

519
00:43:36,147 --> 00:43:38,616
Right? You must think
I'm pretty sick?

520
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:46,323
Right? I bet you really
think I'm sick, right?

521
00:43:53,297 --> 00:43:54,865
You think I'm sick?

522
00:43:58,469 --> 00:44:01,572
You don't have to answer.
I'm paying for the ride.

523
00:44:03,374 --> 00:44:05,509
I picked up this midget, you know.

524
00:44:05,743 --> 00:44:08,245
He's very well-dressed,
Italian suit...

525
00:44:08,512 --> 00:44:10,915
...good-looking,
with a beautiful blonde.

526
00:44:11,182 --> 00:44:13,651
-A lady midget?
-No, the guy was a midget.

527
00:44:13,884 --> 00:44:16,187
-The blonde was a lady.
-I got you.

528
00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:18,422
Those midgets are funny.

529
00:44:19,657 --> 00:44:21,759
Sometimes I like to hold a midget.

530
00:44:21,992 --> 00:44:24,762
They always want to sit
in the front seat.

531
00:44:26,497 --> 00:44:30,267
Then I pick up these two fags.
They're going downtown.

532
00:44:32,403 --> 00:44:36,607
They're wearing rhinestone T-shirts.
They start arguing and yelling.

533
00:44:36,874 --> 00:44:39,844
The other one says, "You bitch,"
and starts beating him.

534
00:44:40,044 --> 00:44:42,546
I say, "I don't care
what you do in the privacy...

535
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:45,116
...of your own home,
behind closed doors."

536
00:44:45,349 --> 00:44:47,051
This is a free country.

537
00:44:47,284 --> 00:44:51,856
We got a pursuit of happiness thing.
You're consenting, you're adult.

538
00:44:52,089 --> 00:44:56,861
But, you know, in my fucking cab,
don't go busting heads.

539
00:44:57,094 --> 00:45:00,064
-Do what you want.
-Tell them to go to California.

540
00:45:00,264 --> 00:45:04,935
In California, when two fags split up,
one's got to pay the other alimony.

541
00:45:06,770 --> 00:45:11,142
Not bad. They're way ahead
out there, you know? California.

542
00:45:11,375 --> 00:45:13,277
So I tell them to get out.

543
00:45:13,477 --> 00:45:16,113
One time, I saw a cop chase
this guy with one leg.

544
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:19,450
-He was on crutches, you know.
-The cop?

545
00:45:19,650 --> 00:45:23,254
No, the dude he was chasing.
Fucking cops, they chase anything.

546
00:45:24,288 --> 00:45:26,624
You got that five you owe me?

547
00:45:28,325 --> 00:45:32,062
My man is loading, loading.

548
00:45:32,630 --> 00:45:36,934
I be broke if I hadn't caught me
some people from Ohio out at Kennedy.

549
00:45:37,134 --> 00:45:41,272
I took them into Manhattan by way
of Long Beach, tipped me $5.

550
00:45:41,505 --> 00:45:43,507
How's the action around?

551
00:45:43,741 --> 00:45:45,309
It's very slow.

552
00:45:46,610 --> 00:45:47,912
I'm shoving on.

553
00:45:48,979 --> 00:45:50,448
Hey, Wiz, wait.

554
00:45:51,315 --> 00:45:54,685
-Can I talk to you for a second?
-Bye, Killer.

555
00:46:15,706 --> 00:46:17,208
You can have them!

556
00:46:17,475 --> 00:46:19,810
Hey, don't be hitting my man!

557
00:46:21,545 --> 00:46:24,115
You better take your ass out, boy!

558
00:46:29,987 --> 00:46:33,157
I know you and I ain't talked
too much, you know.

559
00:46:33,858 --> 00:46:35,793
But you've been around, so...

560
00:46:36,026 --> 00:46:38,529
Shoot, that's why
they call me the Wizard.

561
00:46:38,729 --> 00:46:40,030
I got...

562
00:46:40,831 --> 00:46:42,967
It's just that I got a...

563
00:46:44,902 --> 00:46:46,203
Things got you down?

564
00:46:47,004 --> 00:46:49,473
Yeah, happens to the best of them.

565
00:46:50,541 --> 00:46:53,177
Yeah, they got me real down.
Real...

566
00:46:58,816 --> 00:47:00,251
I just want to go out...

567
00:47:00,484 --> 00:47:04,655
...and you know, really,
really do something.

568
00:47:06,690 --> 00:47:08,592
Taxi life, you mean?

569
00:47:12,429 --> 00:47:14,231
No, it's...

570
00:47:15,499 --> 00:47:16,734
I don't know.

571
00:47:19,069 --> 00:47:21,105
I just want to go out...

572
00:47:24,909 --> 00:47:26,377
I really want to...

573
00:47:26,710 --> 00:47:29,647
I got some bad ideas in my head.

574
00:47:31,715 --> 00:47:33,918
Look at it this way.

575
00:47:36,754 --> 00:47:39,056
A man takes a job.

576
00:47:39,557 --> 00:47:41,158
And that job...

577
00:47:43,294 --> 00:47:45,729
...you know, that becomes what he is.

578
00:47:45,996 --> 00:47:47,798
You know, like...

579
00:47:49,333 --> 00:47:51,969
You do a thing,
and that's what you are.

580
00:47:53,270 --> 00:47:57,007
I've been a cabbie for 17 years.
Ten years at night.

581
00:47:57,274 --> 00:48:00,111
And I still don't own my own cab.
You know why?

582
00:48:00,911 --> 00:48:05,082
Because I don't want to.
That must be what I want.

583
00:48:05,282 --> 00:48:08,452
To be on the night shift,
driving somebody else's cab.

584
00:48:08,652 --> 00:48:10,321
You understand?

585
00:48:11,455 --> 00:48:14,325
You get a job, you become the job.

586
00:48:14,525 --> 00:48:18,095
One guy lives in Brooklyn,
one guy lives in Sutton Place.

587
00:48:18,295 --> 00:48:20,798
You get a lawyer,
another guy's a doctor.

588
00:48:21,031 --> 00:48:24,135
Another guy dies,
another guy gets well...

589
00:48:24,368 --> 00:48:26,137
...and people are born.

590
00:48:26,337 --> 00:48:28,472
I envy you, your youth.

591
00:48:29,607 --> 00:48:33,110
Go out and get laid.
Get drunk. Do anything.

592
00:48:35,713 --> 00:48:38,716
You got no choice, anyway.
I mean, we're all fucked.

593
00:48:40,518 --> 00:48:42,653
More or less, you know?

594
00:48:46,557 --> 00:48:50,561
I don't know. That's about
the dumbest thing I ever heard of.

595
00:48:52,396 --> 00:48:56,867
It's not Bertrand Russell,
but what do you want? I'm a cabbie.

596
00:48:57,134 --> 00:48:59,970
I don't even know what
you're talking about.

597
00:49:00,171 --> 00:49:02,473
Maybe I don't know either.

598
00:49:03,674 --> 00:49:08,345
Don't worry so much. Relax, killer,
you're gonna be all right.

599
00:49:08,579 --> 00:49:11,415
I know.
I've seen a lot of people...

600
00:49:12,349 --> 00:49:13,717
...and I know.

601
00:49:15,186 --> 00:49:16,854
Okay. Thanks, man.

602
00:49:22,426 --> 00:49:25,396
Yeah, you know.
You're all right.

603
00:49:43,414 --> 00:49:47,885
What do you think of your opponent's
chances in the upcoming primary?

604
00:49:48,085 --> 00:49:49,687
Mr. Goodman is a fine man.

605
00:49:49,887 --> 00:49:53,224
I would certainly,
if it came to it, prefer him...

606
00:49:53,557 --> 00:49:55,960
...to our opponent
in the other party.

607
00:49:56,227 --> 00:49:59,864
I think that my programs
are better defined than his.

608
00:50:00,097 --> 00:50:03,768
They're more imaginative.
I have a better chance of winning.

609
00:50:03,968 --> 00:50:06,804
It's academic, though.
He's not going to win. I am.

610
00:50:07,071 --> 00:50:08,773
I see.

611
00:50:09,473 --> 00:50:12,376
Well, one more thing
I'd like to ask you.

612
00:50:12,610 --> 00:50:14,812
How do you feel
your campaign is going?

613
00:50:15,079 --> 00:50:18,215
When we came up with our slogan
"We are the people"...

614
00:50:18,449 --> 00:50:20,718
...when I said
"Let the people rule"...

615
00:50:21,452 --> 00:50:23,788
...I felt I was being
overly optimistic.

616
00:50:23,988 --> 00:50:27,591
I must tell you that I am more
optimistic now than ever before.

617
00:50:27,825 --> 00:50:31,729
The people are rising to the demands
that I have made on them.

618
00:50:31,929 --> 00:50:34,398
The people are beginning to rule.

619
00:50:34,598 --> 00:50:37,234
I feel it is a groundswell.
I know...

620
00:50:37,435 --> 00:50:41,338
...it will continue
through the primary and in Miami.

621
00:50:41,605 --> 00:50:43,340
And I know it will rise...

622
00:50:43,574 --> 00:50:46,277
...to an unprecedented swell
in November.

623
00:52:12,530 --> 00:52:14,765
That bitch!
I'll blow her brains out!

624
00:52:14,965 --> 00:52:19,103
I'll kill her, goddamn it!
I'm gonna get my hands and kill her!

625
00:52:19,370 --> 00:52:20,638
Shoot, goddamn it!

626
00:52:26,410 --> 00:52:27,878
Hey, Sport.

627
00:52:30,414 --> 00:52:33,484
-That guy keeps following us.
-Don't look at him.

628
00:52:49,733 --> 00:52:51,235
Hey, guys.

629
00:52:54,171 --> 00:52:56,006
Wanna take a walk?

630
00:53:08,819 --> 00:53:12,423
Loneliness has followed me
my whole life, everywhere.

631
00:53:12,790 --> 00:53:15,192
In bars, in cars...

632
00:53:15,593 --> 00:53:18,095
...sidewalks, stores, everywhere.

633
00:53:19,196 --> 00:53:20,631
There's no escape.

634
00:53:21,298 --> 00:53:23,534
I'm God's lonely man.

635
00:53:27,605 --> 00:53:29,173
June 8th.

636
00:53:29,673 --> 00:53:32,143
My life has taken another turn again.

637
00:53:32,376 --> 00:53:35,846
The days move along
with regularity, over and over...

638
00:53:36,046 --> 00:53:38,616
...one day indistinguishable
from the next.

639
00:53:38,849 --> 00:53:41,318
A long, continuous chain.

640
00:53:41,519 --> 00:53:43,354
And then suddenly...

641
00:53:43,621 --> 00:53:45,656
...there is change.

642
00:54:00,337 --> 00:54:03,174
This here's Easy Andy.
He's a traveling salesman.

643
00:54:03,374 --> 00:54:05,476
How are you doing, Travis?

644
00:54:28,165 --> 00:54:30,901
-You got a .44 Magnum?
-It's an expensive weapon.

645
00:54:31,102 --> 00:54:33,170
It's all right. I got money.

646
00:54:33,370 --> 00:54:35,072
It's a real monster.

647
00:54:36,107 --> 00:54:39,877
Stop a car at 100 yards,
put a round right through the engine.

648
00:54:51,122 --> 00:54:52,590
Here you go.

649
00:54:53,057 --> 00:54:55,626
It's a premium, high resale weapon.

650
00:55:00,030 --> 00:55:01,365
Look at that.

651
00:55:02,967 --> 00:55:04,702
That's a beauty.

652
00:55:09,473 --> 00:55:12,910
I could sell this gun to some
jungle bunny in Harlem for $500.

653
00:55:13,878 --> 00:55:17,214
But I just deal high-quality goods
to the right people.

654
00:55:18,415 --> 00:55:19,717
How about that?

655
00:55:20,618 --> 00:55:23,087
This might be too big
for practical purposes.

656
00:55:23,420 --> 00:55:25,556
In which case,
for you, I'd recommend...

657
00:55:26,657 --> 00:55:27,758
...38 snub-nosed.

658
00:55:29,794 --> 00:55:31,162
Look at this.

659
00:55:33,564 --> 00:55:35,800
That's a beautiful little gun.

660
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:40,905
It's nickel-plated, snub-nosed,
but basically a service revolver.

661
00:55:41,138 --> 00:55:43,307
It'll stop anything that moves.

662
00:55:43,507 --> 00:55:47,077
The Magnum, they use that
in Africa for killing elephants.

663
00:55:47,311 --> 00:55:48,179
That .38...

664
00:55:48,579 --> 00:55:50,347
...that's a funny gun.

665
00:55:55,453 --> 00:55:57,688
Some of these guns are like toys.

666
00:55:57,922 --> 00:56:01,025
That .38, you go out and
hammer nails with it all day...

667
00:56:01,258 --> 00:56:04,528
...come back and it'll cut
dead center on target every time.

668
00:56:04,962 --> 00:56:08,699
It's got a really nice action to it
and a heck of a wallop.

669
00:56:11,368 --> 00:56:13,137
You interested in an automatic?

670
00:56:14,004 --> 00:56:17,475
It's a Colt .25 automatic.
It's a nice little gun.

671
00:56:17,675 --> 00:56:18,876
It's a beautiful gun.

672
00:56:19,110 --> 00:56:21,679
Holds six shots in the clip,
one in the chamber.

673
00:56:21,879 --> 00:56:23,981
If you're dumb enough
to put one there.

674
00:56:25,483 --> 00:56:26,383
Here.

675
00:56:26,584 --> 00:56:27,885
Look at this.

676
00:56:28,085 --> 00:56:29,587
.380 Walther.

677
00:56:29,854 --> 00:56:32,056
Holds eight shots in the clip.

678
00:56:33,324 --> 00:56:35,192
That's a nice gun.

679
00:56:35,426 --> 00:56:37,895
That's a beautiful little gun.
Look at that.

680
00:56:41,332 --> 00:56:45,603
During World War II, they used
this gun to replace the P38.

681
00:56:46,403 --> 00:56:48,672
Just given out to officers.

682
00:56:54,411 --> 00:56:56,447
Ain't that a little honey?

683
00:57:05,456 --> 00:57:08,225
-How much for everything?
-All together?

684
00:57:08,426 --> 00:57:12,530
Only a jackass would carry
that cannon in the streets like that.

685
00:57:13,597 --> 00:57:17,101
Here's a beautiful handmade holster
I had made in Mexico.

686
00:57:17,368 --> 00:57:19,203
Forty dollars.

687
00:57:19,937 --> 00:57:23,107
Three-fifty for the Magnum,
two-fifty for the .38...

688
00:57:23,307 --> 00:57:26,744
...one and a quarter for the .25,
one-fifty for the .380.

689
00:57:27,111 --> 00:57:30,147
Take this and wait here.
I'll walk down with you.

690
00:57:31,081 --> 00:57:34,051
How about dope? Grass?
Hash? Coke?

691
00:57:34,251 --> 00:57:38,222
Mescaline? Downers?
Nebutal? Chloral hydrates?

692
00:57:38,456 --> 00:57:41,959
-Uppers, amphetamines?
-I'm not interested in that stuff.

693
00:57:42,159 --> 00:57:44,829
I can get you crystal meth,
nitrous oxide.

694
00:57:45,096 --> 00:57:47,465
How about a Cadillac?
A brand-new Cadillac...

695
00:57:47,798 --> 00:57:49,500
...with the pink slip, two grand.

696
00:57:58,142 --> 00:57:59,643
June 29th.

697
00:58:00,744 --> 00:58:04,014
I gotta get in shape.
Too much sitting has ruined my body.

698
00:58:04,248 --> 00:58:06,350
Too much abuse has gone on
for too long.

699
00:58:06,617 --> 00:58:09,019
From now on, it'll be
50 pushups each morning.

700
00:58:09,687 --> 00:58:12,356
Fifty pull-ups.
There will be no more pills.

701
00:58:12,623 --> 00:58:16,761
There will be no more bad food,
no more destroyers of my body.

702
00:58:17,328 --> 00:58:21,031
It'll be total organization.
Every muscle must be tight.

703
00:58:38,115 --> 00:58:40,785
Look at the size of that.
Oh, yeah.

704
00:58:43,320 --> 00:58:45,523
Oh, it looks so good.

705
00:58:50,895 --> 00:58:55,332
It's getting harder and harder,
and it's throbbing now.

706
00:58:56,867 --> 00:59:00,871
The idea had been growing
in my brain for some time.

707
00:59:01,806 --> 00:59:03,240
True force.

708
00:59:03,474 --> 00:59:08,045
All the king's men cannot
put it back together again.

709
01:01:08,632 --> 01:01:12,536
-Where do we get more?
-Where do you think? At headquarters.

710
01:01:12,736 --> 01:01:14,905
All the way back there?

711
01:01:15,139 --> 01:01:16,340
-Come on.
-They'll work.

712
01:01:16,574 --> 01:01:19,243
-Maybe it's the speakers.
-I've done this 100 times.

713
01:01:19,510 --> 01:01:21,745
-You've done this before?
-Yes, don't worry.

714
01:01:22,012 --> 01:01:24,882
-When was the last time?
-I've never done this before.

715
01:01:28,185 --> 01:01:29,019
What?

716
01:01:30,755 --> 01:01:32,757
Come here, come here.

717
01:02:30,748 --> 01:02:33,451
You're a Secret Service man,
aren't you?

718
01:02:35,619 --> 01:02:37,621
Just waiting for the senator.

719
01:02:38,489 --> 01:02:40,758
You're waiting for the senator?

720
01:02:44,595 --> 01:02:46,831
That's a very good answer.

721
01:02:47,098 --> 01:02:49,300
Shit, man.

722
01:02:50,167 --> 01:02:52,436
I'm waiting for the sun to shine.

723
01:02:54,338 --> 01:02:58,075
No, the reason I asked
if you were a Secret Service man--

724
01:02:58,309 --> 01:02:59,844
I won't say anything--

725
01:03:00,111 --> 01:03:01,612
Is because I--

726
01:03:05,583 --> 01:03:07,918
I saw some suspicious-looking
people over there.

727
01:03:08,152 --> 01:03:10,287
-You did?
-They were right over there.

728
01:03:15,826 --> 01:03:18,095
They were just here.

729
01:03:21,465 --> 01:03:23,601
They were very, very...

730
01:03:23,801 --> 01:03:25,369
Suspicious.

731
01:03:28,873 --> 01:03:31,175
Where did they go?

732
01:03:31,442 --> 01:03:34,345
Is it hard to get to be in
the Secret Service?

733
01:03:34,545 --> 01:03:35,379
Why?

734
01:03:35,613 --> 01:03:38,549
I was just curious, because
I think I'd be good at it.

735
01:03:38,816 --> 01:03:40,618
I'm very observant.

736
01:03:40,851 --> 01:03:43,521
I was in the Marine Corps, you know.

737
01:03:43,821 --> 01:03:45,823
I'm good with crowds.

738
01:03:48,192 --> 01:03:51,695
I noticed your little pin there.
It's like a signal, isn't it?

739
01:03:51,962 --> 01:03:52,897
Sort of.

740
01:03:53,164 --> 01:03:57,301
A signal. A secret signal for
the Secret Service.

741
01:04:00,704 --> 01:04:02,706
What kind of guns you guys carry?

742
01:04:02,973 --> 01:04:07,978
.38s? .45s? .357 Magnums?
Something bigger, maybe?

743
01:04:08,212 --> 01:04:12,917
Look, if you're really interested,
if you give me your name and address...

744
01:04:13,184 --> 01:04:16,687
...we'll send you all the information
on how to apply. How's that?

745
01:04:19,256 --> 01:04:21,892
-You will?
-Sure.

746
01:04:22,526 --> 01:04:23,994
Why not?

747
01:04:27,565 --> 01:04:29,400
My name is Henry...

748
01:04:30,935 --> 01:04:33,771
...Krinkle. K-R-l-N-K-L-E.

749
01:04:37,007 --> 01:04:41,078
154 Hopper Avenue.

750
01:04:41,345 --> 01:04:43,180
Hopper?

751
01:04:45,683 --> 01:04:48,385
You know, like a rabbit? Hip, hop.

752
01:04:51,388 --> 01:04:53,390
Fair Lawn, New Jersey.

753
01:04:56,193 --> 01:04:57,261
Is there a zip code?

754
01:04:57,528 --> 01:05:00,464
6-1-0-4-5-2.

755
01:05:03,067 --> 01:05:06,470
That's six digits. 6, 1, ...

756
01:05:07,605 --> 01:05:10,274
Oh, well, 6-1-0-4-5.

757
01:05:13,244 --> 01:05:16,247
I was thinking of my telephone number.

758
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:17,581
Well, I've got it all.

759
01:05:17,782 --> 01:05:20,551
Henry, we'll get all the stuff
right out to you.

760
01:05:20,785 --> 01:05:24,255
Thanks a lot. Hey, great.
Thanks a lot. Hell. Jesus.

761
01:05:24,455 --> 01:05:26,290
-Be careful today.
-Right. Will do.

762
01:05:26,490 --> 01:05:30,694
You have to be careful around
a place like this. Bye.

763
01:06:08,132 --> 01:06:11,368
Faster than you. Fucking sick.

764
01:06:11,569 --> 01:06:14,305
I saw you coming, you fuck.

765
01:06:14,505 --> 01:06:16,173
Shitheel!

766
01:06:19,577 --> 01:06:22,480
I'm standing here.
You make the move.

767
01:06:22,713 --> 01:06:24,381
You make the move.

768
01:06:24,815 --> 01:06:26,517
It's your move.

769
01:06:29,553 --> 01:06:31,756
Don't try it, you fuck.

770
01:06:38,362 --> 01:06:40,164
You talking to me?

771
01:06:42,099 --> 01:06:44,335
You talking to me?

772
01:06:46,103 --> 01:06:48,072
You talking to me?

773
01:06:50,341 --> 01:06:53,711
Then who the hell else are you
talking to? You talking to me?

774
01:06:54,211 --> 01:06:56,213
Well, I'm the only one here.

775
01:06:57,948 --> 01:07:01,419
Who the fuck do you think
you're talking to?

776
01:07:01,719 --> 01:07:03,287
Oh, yeah?

777
01:07:14,398 --> 01:07:16,767
Listen, you fuckers,
you screwheads.

778
01:07:16,967 --> 01:07:19,537
Here is a man who would not
take it anymore.

779
01:07:19,770 --> 01:07:21,906
Who would not let--

780
01:07:22,139 --> 01:07:24,975
Listen, you fuckers,
you screwheads.

781
01:07:25,242 --> 01:07:28,646
Here is a man who would not
take it anymore.

782
01:07:28,913 --> 01:07:30,948
Who stood up against
the scum...

783
01:07:31,148 --> 01:07:33,584
...the cunts, the dogs,
the filth, the shit.

784
01:07:33,818 --> 01:07:36,787
Here is someone who stood up.

785
01:07:37,788 --> 01:07:38,622
Here is...

786
01:07:43,627 --> 01:07:45,096
You're dead.

787
01:08:11,989 --> 01:08:14,258
Hey, Travis, que pasa?

788
01:08:14,492 --> 01:08:16,927
Hi, Melio. Que pasa?

789
01:08:26,670 --> 01:08:27,605
Yeah, man?

790
01:08:27,838 --> 01:08:31,942
Shut your fucking mouth and give
me the cash out the drawer. Come on!

791
01:08:32,176 --> 01:08:34,979
-Let's go. Give me the damn cash.
-Don't shoot.

792
01:08:35,179 --> 01:08:37,381
Stop taking so long.
Come on!

793
01:08:37,615 --> 01:08:40,050
Let me have it. Give me the bread.

794
01:08:40,284 --> 01:08:42,186
-This all you got?
-That's it.

795
01:08:42,386 --> 01:08:44,355
I don't have any more money, man.

796
01:08:44,555 --> 01:08:46,357
-That's all I got!
-You got more.

797
01:08:46,624 --> 01:08:49,727
-I tell you, I got no money!
-Reach in your sock.

798
01:08:49,960 --> 01:08:51,729
Give me the rest of
the fucking bread.

799
01:08:57,535 --> 01:08:59,737
-Did you get him?
-Yeah, I got him.

800
01:09:04,475 --> 01:09:06,677
Shit, man.

801
01:09:08,712 --> 01:09:11,482
-Is he dead?
-I don't know. His eyes are moving.

802
01:09:17,588 --> 01:09:20,891
I ain't got a permit.
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

803
01:09:25,830 --> 01:09:27,398
Don't worry.
I'll take care of it.

804
01:09:27,598 --> 01:09:28,499
Can I pay you?

805
01:09:29,200 --> 01:09:30,534
Just get out of here.

806
01:09:30,734 --> 01:09:33,237
No, man. I'll take care of it.
Go ahead.

807
01:09:37,041 --> 01:09:39,910
That's the fifth motherfucker
this year!

808
01:11:25,583 --> 01:11:28,185
Walt Whitman, that great
American poet...

809
01:11:28,419 --> 01:11:30,488
...spoke for all of us when he said...

810
01:11:30,721 --> 01:11:33,424
..."I am the man. I suffered.

811
01:11:33,657 --> 01:11:36,827
I was there."
Today I say to you...

812
01:11:37,061 --> 01:11:40,431
...we are the people. We suffered.

813
01:11:40,698 --> 01:11:42,933
We were there.

814
01:11:45,269 --> 01:11:48,439
We, the people,
suffered in Vietnam.

815
01:11:48,706 --> 01:11:51,776
We, the people, suffered.
We still suffer...

816
01:11:52,042 --> 01:11:54,779
...from unemployment, inflation...

817
01:11:55,045 --> 01:11:57,047
...crime and corruption.

818
01:12:00,451 --> 01:12:02,253
Dear Father and Mother...

819
01:12:02,520 --> 01:12:04,789
...July is the month I remember...

820
01:12:05,022 --> 01:12:08,225
...which brings not only your
wedding anniversary...

821
01:12:08,426 --> 01:12:11,629
...but also Father's Day
and Mother's birthday.

822
01:12:11,862 --> 01:12:14,765
I'm sorry I can't remember
the exact dates...

823
01:12:14,965 --> 01:12:19,036
...but I hope this card
will take care of them all.

824
01:12:19,270 --> 01:12:22,406
I'm sorry, again, I cannot
send you my address...

825
01:12:22,606 --> 01:12:25,209
...like I promised to last year.

826
01:12:25,443 --> 01:12:30,548
But the sensitive nature of my work for
the government demands utmost secrecy.

827
01:12:31,082 --> 01:12:33,818
I know you will understand.

828
01:12:34,752 --> 01:12:37,421
I am healthy and well
and making lots of money.

829
01:12:37,655 --> 01:12:39,723
I've been dating a girl
for a few months...

830
01:12:39,924 --> 01:12:42,493
...and I know you'd be proud
if you could see her.

831
01:12:43,094 --> 01:12:46,831
Her name is Betsy, but I can tell
you no more than that.

832
01:12:47,064 --> 01:12:49,400
Hey, cabbie, you can't park here.

833
01:12:51,102 --> 01:12:54,472
Come on! Come on, let's go!
Let's go! Move it!

834
01:12:56,607 --> 01:13:00,311
--bear the burden of suffering
for the few.

835
01:13:00,511 --> 01:13:04,081
No more will we fight the wars
of the few...

836
01:13:04,315 --> 01:13:06,350
...through the heart of the many.

837
01:13:10,187 --> 01:13:14,291
I hope this card finds you
all well, as it does me.

838
01:13:14,492 --> 01:13:17,862
I hope no one has died.
Don't worry about me.

839
01:13:18,129 --> 01:13:21,499
One day there will be a knock on
the door and it'll be me.

840
01:13:22,299 --> 01:13:24,301
Love, Travis.

841
01:13:31,008 --> 01:13:32,777
Don't you have some idea?

842
01:13:32,977 --> 01:13:34,712
I'm not the one who
wants to talk.

843
01:13:34,979 --> 01:13:38,983
You must know that the reason
that I didn't marry him...

844
01:13:39,183 --> 01:13:43,053
...is because I couldn't stand
to be a cause of divorce.

845
01:13:45,790 --> 01:13:49,193
Now he's getting a divorce anyway.

846
01:13:52,963 --> 01:13:55,366
Phillip wants to marry me, Brock.

847
01:13:58,669 --> 01:14:00,805
I do love him.

848
01:14:04,842 --> 01:14:06,410
What about us, June?

849
01:14:08,179 --> 01:14:09,747
Our marriage?

850
01:14:12,550 --> 01:14:14,552
You know our marriage wasn't legal.

851
01:14:14,752 --> 01:14:17,888
In the eyes of God, we are married.

852
01:14:21,325 --> 01:14:24,395
Brock, please don't do this to me.

853
01:14:27,031 --> 01:14:27,865
I love him--

854
01:14:37,141 --> 01:14:38,743
Damn.

855
01:14:40,277 --> 01:14:42,279
God damn!

856
01:15:23,120 --> 01:15:25,656
-Are you looking for some action?
-Yeah.

857
01:15:28,826 --> 01:15:32,296
See that guy over there?

858
01:15:32,496 --> 01:15:34,632
Go talk to him.
His name is Matthew.

859
01:15:34,832 --> 01:15:36,934
I'll be over there waiting for you.

860
01:15:41,872 --> 01:15:45,276
Your name Matthew?
I want some action.

861
01:15:45,776 --> 01:15:47,178
Officer.

862
01:15:48,479 --> 01:15:52,383
I swear I'm clean. I'm just
waiting here for a friend.

863
01:15:52,616 --> 01:15:54,852
You're gonna bust me for
nothing, man?

864
01:15:55,119 --> 01:15:57,455
I'm not a cop. I ain't a--

865
01:15:57,655 --> 01:15:59,857
Then why are you asking me for action?

866
01:16:02,460 --> 01:16:04,462
Because she sent me over.

867
01:16:06,697 --> 01:16:09,500
I suppose that ain't a .38
you got in your sock.

868
01:16:09,734 --> 01:16:11,335
.38?

869
01:16:13,037 --> 01:16:15,806
I'm clean, man.

870
01:16:16,040 --> 01:16:18,409
Shit, you're a real cowboy?

871
01:16:18,909 --> 01:16:22,379
That's nice, man. All right.
That's all right.

872
01:16:22,646 --> 01:16:26,350
15 dollars, 15 minutes.
25 dollars, half an hour.

873
01:16:27,985 --> 01:16:29,487
Shit.

874
01:16:29,854 --> 01:16:31,088
Cowboy, huh?

875
01:16:32,757 --> 01:16:35,059
I once had a horse.
On Coney lsland.

876
01:16:35,326 --> 01:16:36,994
She got hit by a car.

877
01:16:39,530 --> 01:16:41,365
Well, take it or leave it.

878
01:16:41,565 --> 01:16:44,935
If you wanna save yourself
some money, don't fuck her.

879
01:16:45,202 --> 01:16:46,570
She'll be back for more.

880
01:16:46,837 --> 01:16:50,741
She's 12 years old. You ain't
never had no pussy like that.

881
01:16:51,609 --> 01:16:53,677
Do anything you want.
Come on her...

882
01:16:53,878 --> 01:16:56,781
...fuck her in the mouth, in the ass.
Come on her face.

883
01:16:57,014 --> 01:17:00,351
She'll get your cock so hard,
she'll make it explode.

884
01:17:02,420 --> 01:17:05,756
But no rough stuff. All right?

885
01:17:10,594 --> 01:17:12,430
All right, I'll take it.

886
01:17:12,730 --> 01:17:16,267
Hey, man! Don't take out no money
over here.

887
01:17:16,467 --> 01:17:17,701
You gonna fuck me?

888
01:17:17,935 --> 01:17:20,971
You're gonna fuck her.
You give her the money.

889
01:17:22,406 --> 01:17:23,974
Catch you later, copper.

890
01:17:25,242 --> 01:17:26,143
What'd you say?

891
01:17:26,410 --> 01:17:27,478
See you later, copper.

892
01:17:29,747 --> 01:17:30,948
I'm no cop, man.

893
01:17:32,450 --> 01:17:35,586
Well, if you are,
it's entrapment already.

894
01:17:38,989 --> 01:17:39,890
I'm hip.

895
01:17:41,092 --> 01:17:43,294
Funny, you don't look hip.

896
01:17:47,264 --> 01:17:49,767
Have yourself a good time.
Go ahead, man.

897
01:17:58,576 --> 01:18:00,611
You're a funny guy.

898
01:18:03,748 --> 01:18:05,816
But looks aren't everything.

899
01:18:06,250 --> 01:18:08,119
Go ahead, man. Have a good time.

900
01:18:57,401 --> 01:18:59,570
The room'll cost you ten bucks.

901
01:19:12,583 --> 01:19:14,518
I'm timing you too.

902
01:19:33,471 --> 01:19:35,072
Come on.

903
01:19:44,548 --> 01:19:46,250
Are you really twelve?

904
01:19:48,486 --> 01:19:52,389
Listen, mister, it's your time.
15 minutes ain't long.

905
01:19:54,925 --> 01:19:57,795
When that cigarette burns out,
your time is up.

906
01:20:01,999 --> 01:20:03,434
How old are you?

907
01:20:05,403 --> 01:20:07,171
You won't tell me?

908
01:20:07,605 --> 01:20:09,273
What's your name?

909
01:20:09,473 --> 01:20:10,674
Easy.

910
01:20:10,908 --> 01:20:12,243
That's not any kind of name.

911
01:20:12,476 --> 01:20:13,811
It's easy to remember.

912
01:20:14,011 --> 01:20:16,480
Yeah, but what's your real name?

913
01:20:16,847 --> 01:20:18,249
I don't like my real name.

914
01:20:18,482 --> 01:20:20,451
What's your real name?

915
01:20:24,321 --> 01:20:25,756
Iris.

916
01:20:26,323 --> 01:20:28,259
What's wrong? It's a nice name.

917
01:20:28,826 --> 01:20:30,528
That's what you think.

918
01:20:37,701 --> 01:20:40,838
No, don't do that.
Don't you remember me?

919
01:20:41,839 --> 01:20:45,176
Remember when you got into a
taxi? It was a checkered taxi.

920
01:20:45,443 --> 01:20:47,478
You got in and that guy
Matthew came by...

921
01:20:47,711 --> 01:20:50,181
...and he said he wanted to
take you away.

922
01:20:50,448 --> 01:20:51,515
He pulled you away.

923
01:20:53,651 --> 01:20:54,885
I don't remember that.

924
01:20:56,454 --> 01:20:57,455
You don't remember?

925
01:21:00,658 --> 01:21:02,226
I'm gonna get you out of here.

926
01:21:02,493 --> 01:21:04,729
We better make it
or Sport will get mad.

927
01:21:04,962 --> 01:21:08,032
-How do you wanna make it?
-I don't want to. Who's Sport?

928
01:21:08,232 --> 01:21:11,001
That's Matthew. I call him Sport.

929
01:21:16,073 --> 01:21:18,075
Wanna make it like this?

930
01:21:24,014 --> 01:21:25,349
Listen, I...

931
01:21:25,549 --> 01:21:27,051
Can't you understand something?

932
01:21:27,318 --> 01:21:29,019
You came into my cab.

933
01:21:29,253 --> 01:21:30,855
You wanted to get out of here.

934
01:21:31,088 --> 01:21:32,523
I must've been stoned.

935
01:21:33,190 --> 01:21:34,725
Why? They drug you?

936
01:21:34,925 --> 01:21:36,360
Come off it, man.

937
01:21:38,095 --> 01:21:39,997
What are you doing?

938
01:21:40,197 --> 01:21:42,199
Don't you wanna make it?

939
01:21:45,436 --> 01:21:47,538
I don't wanna make it.
I wanna help you.

940
01:21:48,606 --> 01:21:50,408
Well, I could help you.

941
01:21:55,012 --> 01:21:56,280
Damn, man!

942
01:21:56,947 --> 01:21:58,549
Goddamn it!

943
01:22:02,586 --> 01:22:05,756
Shit, man. What the hell's
the matter with you?

944
01:22:06,624 --> 01:22:08,426
We don't have to make it, mister.

945
01:22:08,626 --> 01:22:10,694
Damn it!
Don't you want out of here?

946
01:22:13,397 --> 01:22:15,099
Can you understand why I'm here?

947
01:22:16,367 --> 01:22:18,569
I think I understand.

948
01:22:20,237 --> 01:22:22,073
I tried to get into your cab...

949
01:22:22,273 --> 01:22:24,809
...and now you wanna come
and take me away.

950
01:22:26,243 --> 01:22:27,645
Is that it?

951
01:22:27,912 --> 01:22:29,647
Yeah, but don't you wanna go?

952
01:22:29,914 --> 01:22:31,482
I can leave any time I want.

953
01:22:31,715 --> 01:22:33,784
Then what about that one night?

954
01:22:35,886 --> 01:22:37,955
Look, I was stoned.

955
01:22:40,324 --> 01:22:42,560
That's why they stopped me.

956
01:22:44,395 --> 01:22:47,264
When I'm not stoned I got
no place else to go.

957
01:22:48,599 --> 01:22:50,501
So they just...

958
01:22:51,068 --> 01:22:53,237
...protect me from myself.

959
01:23:00,678 --> 01:23:02,113
I don't know.

960
01:23:04,648 --> 01:23:06,951
I don't know. Okay, I tried.

961
01:23:08,686 --> 01:23:10,187
I understand.

962
01:23:10,454 --> 01:23:12,790
And it means something, really.

963
01:23:16,093 --> 01:23:17,928
Well look, can I see you again?

964
01:23:18,162 --> 01:23:20,464
-That's not hard to do.
-Not like that.

965
01:23:20,698 --> 01:23:24,468
I mean, you know, regularly.
This is nothing for a person to do.

966
01:23:24,969 --> 01:23:26,670
How about breakfast tomorrow?

967
01:23:27,037 --> 01:23:28,873
-Tomorrow?
-I get up at 1:00.

968
01:23:29,073 --> 01:23:31,142
One o'clock?

969
01:23:34,044 --> 01:23:36,147
Well, I got that thing.
I don't know--

970
01:23:36,380 --> 01:23:37,648
Do you want to or not?

971
01:23:37,882 --> 01:23:39,884
Yeah, I want--
Okay, all right.

972
01:23:40,084 --> 01:23:41,585
-One o'clock.
-One o'clock.

973
01:23:41,852 --> 01:23:44,488
Okay. See you tomorrow.

974
01:23:45,756 --> 01:23:48,692
Oh, Iris. My name is Travis.

975
01:23:49,894 --> 01:23:51,996
Thanks a lot, Travis.

976
01:23:53,664 --> 01:23:57,001
So long, Iris.
See you tomorrow.

977
01:23:58,335 --> 01:24:00,337
Sweet Iris.

978
01:24:24,361 --> 01:24:26,230
This is yours.

979
01:24:26,464 --> 01:24:28,065
Spend it right.

980
01:24:33,437 --> 01:24:35,272
Come back anytime, cowboy.

981
01:24:35,973 --> 01:24:37,308
I will.

982
01:24:56,093 --> 01:24:58,763
Why do you want me to go back
to my parents?

983
01:24:58,996 --> 01:25:00,464
They hate me.

984
01:25:00,664 --> 01:25:03,968
Why do you think I split?
There ain't nothing there.

985
01:25:04,235 --> 01:25:07,671
But you can't live like this.
It's a hell.

986
01:25:07,938 --> 01:25:09,774
A girl should live at home.

987
01:25:10,608 --> 01:25:12,410
Didn't you ever hear of women's lib?

988
01:25:12,643 --> 01:25:14,412
What do you mean, "women's lib"?

989
01:25:14,612 --> 01:25:17,481
You're a young girl.
You should be at home now.

990
01:25:17,681 --> 01:25:19,817
You should be dressed up,
going out with boys.

991
01:25:20,017 --> 01:25:21,585
You should be going to school.

992
01:25:21,819 --> 01:25:25,523
-You know, that kind of stuff.
-Oh, God, are you square.

993
01:25:25,790 --> 01:25:27,758
I'm not square. You're square.

994
01:25:27,958 --> 01:25:29,860
You're full of shit, man.

995
01:25:30,094 --> 01:25:32,096
What do you mean?
You walk out with...

996
01:25:32,296 --> 01:25:34,832
...fucking creeps,
lowlifes and degenerates...

997
01:25:35,099 --> 01:25:38,502
...and you sell your little
pussy for nothing, man?

998
01:25:38,702 --> 01:25:40,638
For some low-life pimp?

999
01:25:40,871 --> 01:25:42,940
Stands in a hall.

1000
01:25:44,208 --> 01:25:47,178
I'm square? You're the one
that's square, man.

1001
01:25:47,445 --> 01:25:50,815
I don't go screw and fuck with
killers and junkies like you.

1002
01:25:51,849 --> 01:25:53,784
You call that being hip?

1003
01:25:54,652 --> 01:25:56,487
What world you from?

1004
01:26:01,392 --> 01:26:02,226
Who's a killer?

1005
01:26:02,493 --> 01:26:04,462
That guy Sport's a killer.

1006
01:26:04,695 --> 01:26:06,130
Sport never killed nobody.

1007
01:26:06,363 --> 01:26:07,798
-He killed--
-He's a Libra.

1008
01:26:08,032 --> 01:26:09,200
He's a what?

1009
01:26:09,400 --> 01:26:12,737
I'm a Libra too.
That's why we get along so well.

1010
01:26:15,206 --> 01:26:17,808
He looks like a killer to me.

1011
01:26:18,042 --> 01:26:21,712
I think that Cancers make
the best lovers...

1012
01:26:22,246 --> 01:26:24,148
...but my whole family's air signs.

1013
01:26:24,348 --> 01:26:25,549
He's also a dope-shooter.

1014
01:26:26,517 --> 01:26:29,720
What makes you so high and mighty?
Will you tell me that?

1015
01:26:30,321 --> 01:26:33,090
Don't you ever look at your
own eyeballs in the mirror?

1016
01:26:39,196 --> 01:26:41,532
What'll you do about
Sport and that old guy?

1017
01:26:41,732 --> 01:26:43,834
-When?
-When you leave.

1018
01:26:47,538 --> 01:26:48,672
I'll just leave them.

1019
01:26:48,906 --> 01:26:50,741
-Just leave?
-They got other girls.

1020
01:26:50,941 --> 01:26:53,844
You can't just do that.
What are you gonna do?

1021
01:26:56,781 --> 01:26:58,182
Want me to call the cops?

1022
01:26:58,416 --> 01:27:00,918
The cops don't do nothing.
You know that.

1023
01:27:01,552 --> 01:27:05,256
Sport never treated me bad.
He didn't beat me up once.

1024
01:27:05,523 --> 01:27:08,859
But you can't allow him to do
the same to other girls.

1025
01:27:09,060 --> 01:27:10,628
You can't allow him to do that.

1026
01:27:10,895 --> 01:27:13,064
He's the lowest kind of person.

1027
01:27:13,297 --> 01:27:15,199
Somebody's got to do
something to him.

1028
01:27:15,433 --> 01:27:16,901
He's the scum of the earth.

1029
01:27:17,134 --> 01:27:18,636
He's the worst...

1030
01:27:19,937 --> 01:27:22,440
...sucking scum I have ever,
ever seen.

1031
01:27:25,209 --> 01:27:27,611
You know what he told me about you?

1032
01:27:29,914 --> 01:27:33,651
He called you names. He called
you a little piece of chicken.

1033
01:27:36,454 --> 01:27:38,255
He doesn't mean it.

1034
01:27:40,591 --> 01:27:43,894
I'll move up to one of them
communes in Vermont.

1035
01:27:48,265 --> 01:27:51,235
I never seen a commune before,
but I don't know....

1036
01:27:51,469 --> 01:27:53,604
I saw...

1037
01:27:53,904 --> 01:27:57,007
...some photos once in a magazine.
It didn't look very clean.

1038
01:27:57,608 --> 01:27:59,510
Why don't you come with me?

1039
01:27:59,777 --> 01:28:03,314
What? Come to the commune
with you? No, no.

1040
01:28:03,514 --> 01:28:04,949
Why not?

1041
01:28:06,817 --> 01:28:09,553
I don't go to places like that.

1042
01:28:09,820 --> 01:28:10,688
Come on, why not?

1043
01:28:10,955 --> 01:28:12,957
I don't get along with
people like that.

1044
01:28:13,457 --> 01:28:14,959
Are you a Scorpion?

1045
01:28:15,559 --> 01:28:18,896
That's it. You're a Scorpion.
I can tell every time.

1046
01:28:19,997 --> 01:28:22,066
Besides, I gotta stay here.

1047
01:28:22,333 --> 01:28:23,200
Come on. Why?

1048
01:28:23,401 --> 01:28:25,069
I got something important to do.

1049
01:28:25,302 --> 01:28:26,871
So what's so important?

1050
01:28:28,706 --> 01:28:31,008
Doing something for the government.

1051
01:28:31,842 --> 01:28:34,078
The cab thing is just part-time.

1052
01:28:35,246 --> 01:28:36,747
Are you a narc?

1053
01:28:39,216 --> 01:28:40,384
Do I look like a narc?

1054
01:28:43,587 --> 01:28:45,389
I am a narc.

1055
01:28:46,524 --> 01:28:49,994
God! I don't know who's
weirder, you or me.

1056
01:28:56,267 --> 01:29:00,271
-Sure you don't wanna come with me?
-I'll give you the money to go.

1057
01:29:00,871 --> 01:29:03,541
-You don't have to.
-I want you to take it.

1058
01:29:03,774 --> 01:29:06,544
I don't want you to take
anything from them.

1059
01:29:06,877 --> 01:29:08,579
And I wanna do it.

1060
01:29:08,913 --> 01:29:11,348
I don't have anything better
to do with my money.

1061
01:29:13,217 --> 01:29:15,519
I might be going away
for a while.

1062
01:29:41,112 --> 01:29:44,548
You're just a little tense,
that's all.

1063
01:29:44,782 --> 01:29:47,251
I don't like what I'm doing, Sport.

1064
01:29:47,485 --> 01:29:50,454
Baby, I never wanted you
to like what you're doing.

1065
01:29:50,721 --> 01:29:54,625
If you ever liked what you were doing,
you wouldn't be my woman.

1066
01:29:56,327 --> 01:29:58,829
You never spend any time
with me anymore.

1067
01:29:59,063 --> 01:30:02,133
Well, I got to attend
to business, baby.

1068
01:30:03,167 --> 01:30:05,669
You miss your man, don't you?

1069
01:30:07,004 --> 01:30:10,441
I don't like to be away
from you either.

1070
01:30:10,641 --> 01:30:13,177
You know how I feel about you.

1071
01:30:14,311 --> 01:30:16,313
I depend on you.

1072
01:30:18,682 --> 01:30:19,917
I'd be lost without you.

1073
01:30:21,419 --> 01:30:23,821
Don't you ever forget that.

1074
01:30:33,264 --> 01:30:35,499
How much I need you.

1075
01:30:37,635 --> 01:30:39,470
Come to me, baby.

1076
01:30:49,547 --> 01:30:51,348
Let me hold you.

1077
01:30:57,888 --> 01:31:02,193
When you're close to me like this,
I feel so good.

1078
01:31:06,864 --> 01:31:11,368
I only wish every man could know
what it's like to be loved by you.

1079
01:31:16,340 --> 01:31:19,310
That every woman, everywhere...

1080
01:31:21,011 --> 01:31:24,081
...had a man who loves her
like I love you.

1081
01:31:27,918 --> 01:31:31,389
God, it's good so close.

1082
01:31:43,367 --> 01:31:45,369
You know, at times like this...

1083
01:31:45,870 --> 01:31:48,706
...I know I'm a lucky man.

1084
01:31:51,442 --> 01:31:54,745
Touching a woman who
wants me and needs me.

1085
01:32:01,218 --> 01:32:04,121
It's only you that keeps me together.

1086
01:33:36,247 --> 01:33:39,050
Now I see it clearly.
My whole life is pointed...

1087
01:33:39,316 --> 01:33:43,020
...in one direction. I see that now.

1088
01:33:43,254 --> 01:33:46,323
There never has been
any choice for me.

1089
01:34:21,392 --> 01:34:22,426
Ladies and gentlemen...

1090
01:34:22,626 --> 01:34:26,897
...the next president of the U.S.,
Senator Charles Palantine.

1091
01:34:33,304 --> 01:34:34,638
Thank you, Tom.

1092
01:34:35,940 --> 01:34:37,074
Ladies and gentlemen...

1093
01:34:38,075 --> 01:34:42,413
...we are met today at a crossroads,
Columbus Circle.

1094
01:34:42,613 --> 01:34:44,749
This is no ordinary place.

1095
01:34:44,982 --> 01:34:49,787
It is a place where many roads
and many lives intersect.

1096
01:34:50,955 --> 01:34:53,624
It is appropriate that
we meet here today...

1097
01:34:53,891 --> 01:34:57,161
...because these are not ordinary times.

1098
01:34:57,428 --> 01:35:01,298
We meet at a crossroads in history.

1099
01:35:01,899 --> 01:35:05,803
For far too long, the wrong roads
have been taken.

1100
01:35:06,070 --> 01:35:10,307
The wrong roads have led us
into war, into poverty...

1101
01:35:10,574 --> 01:35:13,411
...into unemployment and inflation.

1102
01:35:14,278 --> 01:35:17,982
Today I say to you,
we have reached the turning point.

1103
01:35:21,752 --> 01:35:25,956
No longer will we, the people,
suffer for the few.

1104
01:35:34,131 --> 01:35:38,436
I would lie to you if I told you
the new roads would be easy.

1105
01:35:39,103 --> 01:35:41,172
They will not be easy.

1106
01:35:41,439 --> 01:35:44,942
Nothing that is right and good
has ever been easy.

1107
01:35:45,176 --> 01:35:47,178
We, the people, know that.

1108
01:35:51,215 --> 01:35:55,386
And we, the people,
know the right roads and the good.

1109
01:35:56,387 --> 01:36:00,725
Today I say to you,
we are the people, you and I.

1110
01:36:00,958 --> 01:36:04,228
And it is time to let the people rule!

1111
01:36:04,462 --> 01:36:05,696
Thank you.

1112
01:36:21,812 --> 01:36:24,215
All right, let him through. Pull back.

1113
01:36:45,436 --> 01:36:46,837
Over there. Get that man.

1114
01:36:49,173 --> 01:36:50,775
Give him some air!

1115
01:36:51,442 --> 01:36:53,411
Give him some air, will you?

1116
01:36:53,677 --> 01:36:55,579
-I never saw him.
-I saw him run.

1117
01:36:55,813 --> 01:36:57,748
-I saw him.
-Where was he?

1118
01:37:24,341 --> 01:37:25,509
What's happening?

1119
01:37:25,776 --> 01:37:27,078
Got the money?

1120
01:37:38,322 --> 01:37:39,790
Iris in her room?

1121
01:38:16,861 --> 01:38:18,796
Hey, Sport, how you doing?

1122
01:38:18,996 --> 01:38:21,065
Okay, okay, my man. How--

1123
01:38:22,566 --> 01:38:25,503
-Where do I know you from, man?
-I don't know.

1124
01:38:25,703 --> 01:38:27,972
How's everything in the pimp business?

1125
01:38:29,173 --> 01:38:30,241
Do I know you?

1126
01:38:30,508 --> 01:38:31,342
No.

1127
01:38:31,542 --> 01:38:32,977
Do I know you?

1128
01:38:33,244 --> 01:38:35,079
Get out of here. Get lost.

1129
01:38:35,346 --> 01:38:36,914
Do I know you?

1130
01:38:39,250 --> 01:38:40,684
How's Iris?

1131
01:38:40,918 --> 01:38:42,353
You know Iris.

1132
01:38:42,553 --> 01:38:45,256
No, I don't know nobody named Iris.

1133
01:38:45,489 --> 01:38:47,558
Iris? Come on, get out of here, man.

1134
01:38:48,059 --> 01:38:50,061
You don't know Iris?

1135
01:38:50,327 --> 01:38:52,763
I don't know nobody named Iris.

1136
01:38:53,264 --> 01:38:54,532
No?

1137
01:38:55,066 --> 01:38:57,401
Get back to your tribe
before you get hurt.

1138
01:38:57,668 --> 01:39:00,071
I don't want no trouble, okay?

1139
01:39:01,572 --> 01:39:03,007
You got a gun?

1140
01:39:04,241 --> 01:39:07,378
Get the fuck out of here, man.
Get out of here.

1141
01:39:07,845 --> 01:39:09,447
Suck on this.

1142
01:40:23,687 --> 01:40:25,790
You crazy son of a bitch!

1143
01:40:26,023 --> 01:40:27,458
Fucking son of a bitch!

1144
01:40:27,691 --> 01:40:29,527
I'll kill you!

1145
01:40:29,760 --> 01:40:32,329
I'll kill you! I'll kill you!

1146
01:40:33,831 --> 01:40:35,499
I'll fucking kill you!

1147
01:40:35,700 --> 01:40:36,634
Son of a bitch!

1148
01:40:36,867 --> 01:40:37,835
I'll kill you!

1149
01:40:56,954 --> 01:41:00,391
You fucking bastard! I'll kill you!

1150
01:41:00,658 --> 01:41:04,328
You crazy son of a bitch!
I'll kill you!

1151
01:41:25,549 --> 01:41:26,550
Don't shoot him!

1152
01:46:06,063 --> 01:46:07,565
Dear Mr. Bickle.:

1153
01:46:07,832 --> 01:46:11,736
I can't say how happy
Mrs. Steensma and I were...

1154
01:46:11,936 --> 01:46:14,905
...to hear that you are
well and recuperating.

1155
01:46:15,172 --> 01:46:18,008
We tried to visit you at the hospital...

1156
01:46:18,242 --> 01:46:20,945
...when we were in New York
to pick up Iris...

1157
01:46:21,212 --> 01:46:23,781
...but you were still in a coma.

1158
01:46:24,048 --> 01:46:26,117
There is no way we can repay you...

1159
01:46:26,350 --> 01:46:29,453
...for returning our Iris to us.

1160
01:46:29,720 --> 01:46:31,389
We thought we had lost her...

1161
01:46:31,622 --> 01:46:34,759
...and now our lives are full again.

1162
01:46:35,259 --> 01:46:36,594
Needless to say...

1163
01:46:36,861 --> 01:46:41,365
...you are something
of a hero around this household.

1164
01:46:42,066 --> 01:46:45,569
I'm sure you want to know about Iris.

1165
01:46:45,770 --> 01:46:49,306
She's back in school and working hard.

1166
01:46:49,573 --> 01:46:52,610
The transition has been
very hard for her...

1167
01:46:52,810 --> 01:46:54,745
...as you can well imagine.

1168
01:46:54,945 --> 01:46:57,214
But we have taken steps to see...

1169
01:46:57,415 --> 01:47:01,585
...she has never cause
to run away again.

1170
01:47:02,219 --> 01:47:03,587
In conclusion...

1171
01:47:03,821 --> 01:47:07,558
...Mrs. Steensma and I
would like to again thank you...

1172
01:47:07,792 --> 01:47:10,461
...from the bottom of our hearts.

1173
01:47:10,728 --> 01:47:14,765
Unfortunately, we cannot afford
to come to New York again...

1174
01:47:14,999 --> 01:47:18,936
...to thank you in person,
or we surely would.

1175
01:47:19,170 --> 01:47:22,006
But if you should ever
come to Pittsburgh...

1176
01:47:22,273 --> 01:47:26,811
...you would find yourself
a most welcome guest in our home.

1177
01:47:27,111 --> 01:47:32,016
Our deepest thanks,
Burt and Ivy Steensma.

1178
01:47:32,950 --> 01:47:37,488
Eddie, the owner-operator, comes up
and says, "I want to swap tires."

1179
01:47:37,688 --> 01:47:39,290
I say, "These are new tires.

1180
01:47:39,824 --> 01:47:42,693
Why not throw in something else,
like your wife?"

1181
01:47:42,927 --> 01:47:44,662
She was Miss New Jersey, 1957.

1182
01:47:44,929 --> 01:47:46,964
That's why the fleet has no spares.

1183
01:47:47,198 --> 01:47:49,600
Doughboy, Wizard, Killer.

1184
01:47:49,800 --> 01:47:52,269
-Charlie T.
-What's happening?

1185
01:47:52,770 --> 01:47:54,772
Hey, Travis, you got a fare.

1186
01:47:56,273 --> 01:47:57,508
Shit.

1187
01:47:58,342 --> 01:47:59,777
Well, see you later.

1188
01:48:00,010 --> 01:48:01,645
See you, Travis.

1189
01:48:22,800 --> 01:48:24,568
Hello, Travis.

1190
01:48:26,003 --> 01:48:27,238
Hello.

1191
01:48:48,159 --> 01:48:50,861
I hear Palantine got the nomination.

1192
01:48:52,163 --> 01:48:55,232
Yeah, won't be long now.
Seventeen days.

1193
01:48:56,333 --> 01:48:58,169
Well, I hope he wins.

1194
01:49:11,782 --> 01:49:14,885
I read about you in the papers.
How are you?

1195
01:49:17,722 --> 01:49:20,458
It was nothing, really.

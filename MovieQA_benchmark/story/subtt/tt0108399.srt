171
00:14:08,056 --> 00:14:10,599
If you were paid to be there,
what are you? A theater checker?

172
00:14:10,767 --> 00:14:12,726

ripping the place off?

174
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:17,731
I'm not a theater checker.
I'm a call girl.

Okay, here it goes. You know the place
you took me to last night?

180

- Yeah.
- Okay, what's his name?

181
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:39,586
Lance.

182
00:14:39,796 --> 00:14:42,047
That's him. He called
the place where I work.

183
00:14:42,215 --> 00:14:44,716
He ordered a girl for you.
He said he wanted you to get laid.

184
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:48,136
Said you didn't get out much,
and it was your birthday and all.

Now, how did he know
you were gonna be at that theater?

187
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:57,270
Well, I go to the movies
every year on my birthday.

188
00:14:57,438 --> 00:14:59,356
In fact, he called me up
this week to find out...

189
00:14:59,524 --> 00:15:01,566
...what my birthday movie
was gonna be.

No, man. I can't tell you...

That was one of the best times
I ever had.

193
00:15:08,825 --> 00:15:11,827
It was. You know, I knew something
must be rotten in Denmark.

There's no way
you could like me that much.

when you took off your dress...

There's a note on your TV.

00:15:23,798 --> 00:15:26,717
And all it says is, "Dear Clarence,"
because I couldn't write any more.

200

So I just said, "Alabama, come clean."

00:38:29,557 --> 00:38:31,058
When did you get married?

502
00:38:33,686 --> 00:38:36,605
Well, Daddy...

503
00:38:38,691 --> 00:38:41,360
I'm in big fucking trouble.

504
00:38:41,528 --> 00:38:44,196
I just... I really need your help.

505
00:38:44,364 --> 00:38:46,615
No, no, stop talking.

506
00:38:49,702 --> 00:38:51,370
- What do you want from me?
- What?

507
00:38:51,579 --> 00:38:55,082
What do you want from me?
Stop acting like an infant!

508
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:57,709
You're out here because you want me
to help you in some way.

509
00:38:57,877 --> 00:39:00,295
What do you need from me?
You need money?

510
00:39:00,463 --> 00:39:02,965
No. You still have
friends on the force?

511
00:39:03,133 --> 00:39:04,967
Yes, I still have friends on the force.

512
00:39:05,135 --> 00:39:07,344
Could you just find out
if they know anything about us?

513
00:39:07,512 --> 00:39:10,389
I don't think they know shit. But I don't
want to think, I want to know for sure.

514
00:39:10,557 --> 00:39:12,141
I mean, you can do that. Right?

515
00:39:12,308 --> 00:39:15,561
- What makes you think that I could do that?
- Because you were a cop.

516
00:39:15,728 --> 00:39:19,064
But what makes you think
that I would do that?

517
00:39:19,649 --> 00:39:21,567
Because I'm your son.

518
00:39:22,152 --> 00:39:23,819
Oh, you're my son.

519
00:39:23,987 --> 00:39:26,488
Oh, you got it all worked out.

520
00:39:26,656 --> 00:39:28,448
Don't you? Huh? Oh, yeah.

521
00:39:28,741 --> 00:39:32,286
Look. I mean, goddamn, I've never
asked you for a goddamn thing.

522
00:39:32,453 --> 00:39:34,746
But Jesus fucking Christ!
After Mom divorced you...

523
00:39:34,914 --> 00:39:37,624
...did I ever ask you for anything?
No. I didn't.

524
00:39:37,792 --> 00:39:40,377
And when I wouldn't see you
for a year-and-a-half to two years...

525
00:39:40,545 --> 00:39:42,129
...did I ever get in
your shit about it?

526
00:39:42,297 --> 00:39:44,923
In that whole fucking time
you were a drunk, did I ever get mad...

527
00:39:45,091 --> 00:39:48,760
...and point my finger at you? No!
I never did. Everybody else did, but I didn't.

528
00:39:48,928 --> 00:39:53,098
Now look, I just need help,
and you can fucking help me. All right?

529
00:39:53,266 --> 00:39:56,894
Now, I'm basically a pretty resourceful guy.
If I didn't really need it, I wouldn't ask.

530
00:39:58,479 --> 00:40:01,982
I mean, if you want
to say "no," then fine.

531
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:05,611
Forget it, don't worry about it.
No problem, I'm gone, all right?

532
00:40:11,451 --> 00:40:13,202
The Virgin is back!

533
00:40:14,746 --> 00:40:17,289
Thank God. I could eat a horse,
if you slap enough ketchup on it.

534
00:40:17,457 --> 00:40:20,584
- I didn't get you any chicken.
- Well, how come?

535
00:40:20,752 --> 00:40:23,629
Honey, it's too early in the morning.
It's only 9:00.

536
00:40:23,796 --> 00:40:25,714
Son of a bitch.

537
00:40:32,388 --> 00:40:35,182
Dick Richie! Dick Richie!

538
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:37,726
That's me, I'm me.

539
00:40:37,894 --> 00:40:40,437
- Come inside.
- Okay.

540
00:40:46,486 --> 00:40:48,695
Sit. Sit, sit, sit.

541
00:40:48,863 --> 00:40:52,324
Now. The part you will be reading for
is one of the bad guys.

542
00:40:52,492 --> 00:40:55,035
- There's Brian and Marty.
- Who?

543
00:40:55,495 --> 00:40:58,121
- Is there a problem?
- No, no.

544
00:40:58,456 --> 00:41:00,582
Peter Breck has already been cast
in the part of Brian.

545
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:03,126
So, you'll be reading
for the role of Marty.

546
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:07,714
In this scene, you're both in a car,
and Bill Shatner's hanging on the hood.

547
00:41:07,882 --> 00:41:10,425
What you want to do is get him off.

548
00:41:11,094 --> 00:41:12,594
All right, I'm Marty.

549
00:41:13,846 --> 00:41:15,347
- Ready?
- Yeah.

550
00:41:16,349 --> 00:41:17,683
Okay.

551
00:41:18,142 --> 00:41:21,186
I'm driving. Okay.

552
00:41:22,355 --> 00:41:23,855
Where the fuck did he come from?!

553
00:41:24,023 --> 00:41:26,275
I don't know,
he just appeared like magic.

554
00:41:26,442 --> 00:41:29,361
Well, don't just sit there, shoot him!

555
00:41:30,655 --> 00:41:33,031
- Get him!
- Thank you, Mr. Richie.

556
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:37,119
I'm very impressed.
You're a very fine actor.

557
00:41:37,287 --> 00:41:39,204
Thank you.

558
00:41:39,372 --> 00:41:40,998
Thank you.

559
00:41:41,165 --> 00:41:42,833
We'll let you know.

560
00:41:43,001 --> 00:41:44,001
Okay.

561
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:45,961
- Okay, one-handed.
- One hand.

562
00:41:46,629 --> 00:41:49,256
Oh! Slipped in the other one there.

563
00:41:49,424 --> 00:41:50,716
Here comes the train.

564
00:42:00,977 --> 00:42:06,773
Well, they found nothing.
In fact, they think it's drug related.

565
00:42:06,941 --> 00:42:08,775
Drug related? Why drug related?

566
00:42:08,943 --> 00:42:12,112
Well, apparently Drexl had his
big toe stuck in that shit.

567
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:13,488
Really?

568
00:42:13,656 --> 00:42:17,534
Drexl had an association with
a fellow named Blue Lou Boyle.

569
00:42:17,702 --> 00:42:19,995
- Name mean anything to you?
- No.

570
00:42:20,163 --> 00:42:22,706
Well, if you don't hang around
his circle, no reason it should.

571
00:42:22,874 --> 00:42:24,166
Why? Who is he?

572
00:42:24,334 --> 00:42:27,044
Gangster, drug dealer. Somebody
who you don't want on your ass.

573
00:42:27,211 --> 00:42:31,256
Now look, Clarence, the more I hear
about this Drexl fucker...

574
00:42:31,424 --> 00:42:33,258
...the more I think
you did the right thing.

575
00:42:33,426 --> 00:42:35,719
This guy was not just some wild flake.

576
00:42:35,887 --> 00:42:38,013
No, man, that's what
I was trying to tell you before.

577
00:42:38,181 --> 00:42:40,307
The guy was like a mad dog.

578
00:42:41,267 --> 00:42:44,102
So, the cops, they don't think...
They're not after us.

579
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:46,730
No. Until they hear something better...

580
00:42:46,898 --> 00:42:50,359
...they'll just assume Drexl
had a falling out with Blue Lou.

581
00:42:51,736 --> 00:42:54,196
And once you leave town,
I wouldn't even worry about it.

582
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:58,825
Thanks, thanks a lot, Daddy.
You really came through for me.

583
00:43:01,537 --> 00:43:03,288
I got some money I could give you.

584
00:43:03,456 --> 00:43:05,457
No, keep it. Keep it.

585
00:43:06,376 --> 00:43:08,126
Well, now, son.

586
00:43:09,295 --> 00:43:11,588
I want you to know that...

587
00:43:11,756 --> 00:43:15,759
...I hope everything works
out with you and Alabama.

588
00:43:15,927 --> 00:43:17,886
I like her.

589
00:43:18,805 --> 00:43:22,641
And I think you make
a real cute couple.

590
00:43:24,936 --> 00:43:29,439
Yeah, well, you stay out of trouble. Hm?

591

That's where we're going to be.

through him. All right.

Kiss Pops goodbye.

Bye, Daddy. Hope to see you again soon.

Hey, hey! What kind of
daughterly smackeroo is that?

602
00:44:25,329 --> 00:44:27,330
I'll send you a postcard
from Hollywood, all right?

- Now, Bama... Bama.
- Yes, sir?

Take care of that one for me.

605

Don't worry, Daddy. I'm going
to keep this fellow on a short leash.

606
00:44:34,297 --> 00:44:37,799
As the sun sets slowly in the west
we bid you a fine farewell.

607
00:44:43,306 --> 00:44:45,348
Bye, Daddy!

I'm a married man, buddy.

Married man. You want to
say "hello" to my better half?

you my best friend too.

to distribute it.

1
00:00:28,878 --> 00:00:31,353
B

2
00:00:32,803 --> 00:00:35,416
A

3
00:00:35,313 --> 00:00:37,148
Are you having fun,
sweetheart?

4
00:00:37,076 --> 00:00:38,794
Yes

5
00:00:42,898 --> 00:00:44,085
I hope you're doing better
than me, baby,

6
00:00:44,039 --> 00:00:46,948
what are you making?
- Necklace for mom.

7
00:00:46,833 --> 00:00:52,150
Yeah? Let me see.
Wow. Another one?

8
00:00:51,939 --> 00:00:53,047
Yes

9
00:00:53,004 --> 00:00:56,206
Honey...
- That's two today.

10
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:58,022
Yeah
- Yeah?

11
00:00:57,946 --> 00:00:59,725
Honey!
Yeah

12
00:00:59,654 --> 00:01:01,697
Are you gonna help me
get that?

13
00:01:01,617 --> 00:01:04,470
I thought you and I
had a day off

14
00:01:06,498 --> 00:01:09,819
Go wash up for dinner, pumpkin.
- Okay.

15
00:01:09,688 --> 00:01:12,983
Mmm, smells nice.
Is that take-out?

16
00:01:12,853 --> 00:01:14,187
Mommy, mommy

17
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:24,596
No!

18
00:01:24,989 --> 00:01:27,407
No, noo.

19
00:01:32,974 --> 00:01:34,960
Noo Noo!

20
00:01:34,882 --> 00:01:37,383
You can't fight faith.

21
00:01:48,189 --> 00:01:49,527
We gotta get the fuck
out of her.

22
00:01:49,474 --> 00:01:51,278
What are you doing?
Come on!

23
00:01:58,476 --> 00:02:00,452
Fucking stop!
Let's go!

24
00:02:00,375 --> 00:02:02,745
Shut the fuck up!

25
00:02:15,219 --> 00:02:17,023
It's cool.

26
00:02:17,769 --> 00:02:19,854
Kids like me.

27
00:02:42,238 --> 00:02:46,383
"Law abiding Citizen"

28
00:02:46,217 --> 00:02:49,827
Transcribed by: anreith.
For inSanos

29
00:03:11,997 --> 00:03:14,616
Nick.
Bringham, what's happening?

30
00:03:14,513 --> 00:03:16,632
Willis is a rowing
buddy of mine

31
00:03:16,548 --> 00:03:18,113
Where are we on his
kids case?

32
00:03:18,052 --> 00:03:19,011
Willis?
- Yeah

33
00:03:18,974 --> 00:03:20,213
Oh, I kicked that
down the tube.

34
00:03:20,164 --> 00:03:21,164
Now why did you do that?

35
00:03:21,125 --> 00:03:21,961
Because the case
was a dog

36
00:03:21,929 --> 00:03:23,098
The kid was only 15
years old

37
00:03:23,052 --> 00:03:24,614
when he commited
the murder.

38
00:03:24,553 --> 00:03:26,187
So you didn't want to
jeapordize your

39
00:03:26,123 --> 00:03:28,651
95% conviction rate.
- It's actually 96%.

40
00:03:28,551 --> 00:03:30,193
96 now?
- Yes,

41
00:03:33,949 --> 00:03:35,230
You know, if I didn't
know any better

42
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:36,649
I'd say you were
gunning for my job.

43
00:03:36,591 --> 00:03:38,546
You do know better,
and you know that

44
00:03:38,469 --> 00:03:40,479
I'm aiming much
higher than that.

45
00:03:41,261 --> 00:03:43,390
They filed a motion
to dismiss, but

46
00:03:43,307 --> 00:03:44,756
there's no way that
judge Abrams honors it.

47
00:03:44,698 --> 00:03:46,469
I think that we can
get him on RICO

48
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,128
All that time and that's
what you come back with, Sarah?

49
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:51,888
You might wanna re-evaluate
your research skills,

50
00:03:51,776 --> 00:03:54,266
what else have we got?
- She's right

51
00:03:54,167 --> 00:03:56,495
Mr Rice?
- RICO's designed for this

52
00:03:56,403 --> 00:03:59,147
check out section 901 of the
organized crime control act

53
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:01,427
and you should let
Sarah try this case, too.

54
00:04:01,333 --> 00:04:04,616
Mr Rice, last I checked
I was running this room.

55
00:04:04,486 --> 00:04:06,839
She's already done the leg
work. I'll oversee it,

56
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:09,059
Helen Keller could
try this case.

57
00:04:10,485 --> 00:04:13,489
Okay boy-wonder, she
fucks up it's on you.

58
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:14,370
(DONT FUCK IT UP)

59
00:04:17,421 --> 00:04:18,591
"Thank you"

60
00:04:19,667 --> 00:04:22,265
Cantrell wants to see you
- Alright, I'll be right there.

61
00:04:22,163 --> 00:04:26,152
No. Nick.
He wants to see Nick.

62
00:04:27,055 --> 00:04:28,426
You're still torturing
Bringham?

63
00:04:28,372 --> 00:04:29,595
Let's just say I'm less
impressed with his

64
00:04:29,547 --> 00:04:30,931
Harvard degree than he is.

65
00:04:30,877 --> 00:04:31,877
We can't all have gone
to Fordham.

66
00:04:31,838 --> 00:04:33,472
I went to Fordham
night school.

67
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:35,599
You know what I learned
at Fordham night school?

68
00:04:35,514 --> 00:04:37,390
It's that law schools have
nothing to do with law.

69
00:04:37,315 --> 00:04:39,164
Guess you skipped the course
on inter-office politics.

70
00:04:39,092 --> 00:04:43,583
All I need is a jury to like me,
isn't that what you told me?

71
00:04:43,406 --> 00:04:44,758
The Shelton case,
where are we?

72
00:04:44,704 --> 00:04:48,565
It went sideways last night.
Judge Birch.

73
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:51,173
Bad news. What now?

74
00:04:51,063 --> 00:04:51,965
Let's make the deal.

75
00:04:51,931 --> 00:04:53,666
They killed a little girl, Nick.

76
00:04:53,597 --> 00:04:56,076
It's an imperfect system.
- And we it's imperfect servants.

77
00:04:55,979 --> 00:04:57,802
However, you could win this case.

78
00:04:57,729 --> 00:04:59,901
Can't take that chance.

79
00:04:59,817 --> 00:05:03,272
Some justice is better than
no justice at all.

80
00:05:03,134 --> 00:05:06,835
You need to tell the husband.
- It's part of my job.

81
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:10,368
Good. Because he is waiting for
you right now.

82
00:05:10,222 --> 00:05:11,446
What?

83
00:05:13,797 --> 00:05:17,199
Do you trust me?

84
00:05:18,614 --> 00:05:21,060
Do you trust me, Clyde?

85
00:05:22,101 --> 00:05:23,623
Yeah, of course.

86
00:05:25,832 --> 00:05:29,505
Darby has agreed to
testify against Ames.

87
00:05:29,359 --> 00:05:34,406
With Darbys testimony,
Ames will go to death row.

88
00:05:38,334 --> 00:05:41,908
What about, what about
Darby then?

89
00:05:41,767 --> 00:05:44,055
Darby will plead guilty
to murder.

90
00:05:45,138 --> 00:05:48,854
In what degree?
- Third.

91
00:05:48,707 --> 00:05:50,895
He serves, what, 5 years?

92
00:05:50,808 --> 00:05:53,456
At best.

93
00:05:53,352 --> 00:05:55,669
I dont understand,
I'm sorry.

94
00:05:55,578 --> 00:05:57,781
We had a setback, Clyde.
The judge ruled that

95
00:05:57,694 --> 00:06:01,006
the DNA was inadmissable.
- What?

96
00:06:00,875 --> 00:06:02,521
Exclusionary rule.

97
00:06:02,457 --> 00:06:04,702
The oposing council maneuvered.

98
00:06:04,613 --> 00:06:06,725
You said this part of the case
was clear cut

99
00:06:06,642 --> 00:06:09,971
We had the blood on his shirt,
- It's covered under the same rule

100
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,733
What about the rest
of the forensic evidence?

101
00:06:11,657 --> 00:06:16,000
It's not conclusive, Clyde.

102
00:06:16,896 --> 00:06:20,500
Okay, thats okay. Because I saw,
I saw their faces

103
00:06:20,357 --> 00:06:23,100
I saw them do it. I mean
they killed my little girl, Nick.

104
00:06:22,991 --> 00:06:26,507
You blacked out, Clyde. Your
testimony won't be reliable.

105
00:06:26,368 --> 00:06:29,351
you get on the stand and
the defense will tear you apart.

106
00:06:29,234 --> 00:06:31,405
No no, the jury is going
to believe me, though,

107
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:33,100
because its the truth.
We can win

108
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:38,021
We can lose. And then
we have nothing.

109
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:39,000
You would have wasted
a whole year,

110
00:06:38,954 --> 00:06:41,223
spent millions of dollars,
and then both of them

111
00:06:41,134 --> 00:06:42,368
can end up going free.

112
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:46,323
Both of them are guilty,
especially Darby. You know that.

113
00:06:46,164 --> 00:06:51,244
It's not what you know, Clyde,
its what you can prove in court.

114
00:06:53,937 --> 00:06:55,858
Please dont make
a deal with them.

115
00:06:55,782 --> 00:06:59,450
Please don't make a deal
- I'm sorry, the deal is done.

116
00:06:59,305 --> 00:07:01,170
I'm sorry.

117
00:07:01,097 --> 00:07:04,885
I made the deal.
- What?

118
00:07:04,734 --> 00:07:05,678
How could you do that?

119
00:07:05,642 --> 00:07:08,910
This is just how the
justice system works.

120
00:07:09,982 --> 00:07:13,888
Listen, I know you don't
think it right now,

121
00:07:13,733 --> 00:07:18,254
but this is a victory
for us.

122
00:07:19,727 --> 00:07:22,542
Your office has certified
this agreement?

123
00:07:22,432 --> 00:07:24,579
Yes, your honor.
- Mr Reynolds?

124
00:07:24,494 --> 00:07:27,831
Any great insights to share
with the court today?

125
00:07:27,699 --> 00:07:30,137
No, your honor.
No insights.

126
00:07:30,041 --> 00:07:31,603
Good, then I trust that
we can move forward

127
00:07:31,541 --> 00:07:34,849
with Mr Ames' trial
unimpeded by delays

128
00:07:34,719 --> 00:07:37,335
a trial date is imminent.

129
00:07:40,934 --> 00:07:43,639
There's no cell phones
in my courtroom, mr Rice.

130
00:07:43,532 --> 00:07:46,667
We've been over this.
- I'm sorry.

131
00:07:46,543 --> 00:07:49,608
I had some exigent
business I was...

132
00:07:49,487 --> 00:07:51,487
Next time it's mine.

133
00:07:54,834 --> 00:07:57,742
Ahh, you married?
- Excuse me?

134
00:07:57,628 --> 00:07:59,958
Are you married?

135
00:08:00,894 --> 00:08:05,571
Please fuck this up.
So I can destroy you.

136
00:08:10,221 --> 00:08:13,282
I wish ill for no man
but Ames deserves

137
00:08:13,161 --> 00:08:15,684
to suffer for what he did.

138
00:08:15,584 --> 00:08:19,683
I mean you cant
fight faith, right?

139
00:08:24,668 --> 00:08:26,084
Nick.

140
00:08:26,029 --> 00:08:28,271
Once you make a decision,
live with it. Move on.

141
00:08:28,182 --> 00:08:31,147
In this job your best
asset is a short memory.

142
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:33,021
Don't beat yourself up,
too many other people

143
00:08:32,943 --> 00:08:34,233
out there doing that
already. Look,

144
00:08:34,182 --> 00:08:36,003
there's some of them
right now.

145
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:41,170
Isn't this when you tell
me some old favel, wise tale...

146
00:08:40,962 --> 00:08:43,049
Alright, alright. I got one.

147
00:08:42,967 --> 00:08:44,979
Marcus Aurelius had a
servant walk behind him

148
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:46,962
as he made his way to
the roman time square.

149
00:08:46,881 --> 00:08:50,148
And the servants only job
was to whisper in his ear

150
00:08:50,018 --> 00:08:53,105
when people praised him:
"You're only a man"

151
00:08:52,983 --> 00:08:56,074
"You're only a man"
Okay, man?

152
00:08:56,681 --> 00:08:58,286
That's some bullshit.
- That's good

153
00:08:58,223 --> 00:08:59,847
I don't even think you
know the story, man.

154
00:08:59,783 --> 00:09:01,662
You're missing the point,
Nick, it doesnt matter

155
00:09:01,588 --> 00:09:05,276
what they say.
- Okay. I got this now.

156
00:09:07,872 --> 00:09:09,735
One at a time.
One at a time.

157
00:09:09,662 --> 00:09:11,259
So you'll be seeking the
death penalty?

158
00:09:11,196 --> 00:09:13,227
For Rupert Ames we will be.
- And for Darby?

159
00:09:13,147 --> 00:09:16,246
He has pled guilty to murder
but he is a cooperating witness.

160
00:09:16,124 --> 00:09:18,617
The DAs office has commited
all of its resources

161
00:09:18,519 --> 00:09:21,016
to ensure that
justice will be served.

162
00:09:20,917 --> 00:09:21,917
Did you make any kind of...

163
00:09:28,012 --> 00:09:31,445
I just wanna say thanks
for being in my corner.

164
00:09:31,308 --> 00:09:34,486
It's nice when the
system works, right?

165
00:09:34,361 --> 00:09:36,130
Get away from me.

166
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:37,060
Come on. Move it.

167
00:09:51,423 --> 00:09:53,598
Let's go.

168
00:10:20,243 --> 00:10:22,771
Uh-uh, what happened?
- What happened where?

169
00:10:25,529 --> 00:10:26,964
What's wrong?

170
00:10:28,081 --> 00:10:30,472
And you call my job boring.

171
00:10:30,377 --> 00:10:32,690
C minus?
- Yes

172
00:10:34,522 --> 00:10:37,030
Well, okay, now,

173
00:10:36,931 --> 00:10:39,024
You gonna tell me
whats wrong?

174
00:10:38,942 --> 00:10:44,083
Can I talk to my daughter
for a little bit?

175
00:10:44,792 --> 00:10:48,204
Nooo...
- Please

176
00:10:48,069 --> 00:10:50,085
First of all, this is your
father speaking

177
00:10:50,006 --> 00:10:52,266
Yeah, she didnt know that.
- You never know.

178
00:10:52,176 --> 00:10:55,261
I want you to stay in there
as long as you can

179
00:10:55,139 --> 00:10:57,829
Cause there's a lot of crazy
ass people out here.

180
00:10:57,724 --> 00:11:02,365
Language!
- Your mother is a hardass.

181
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:03,683
I'm right here.

182
00:11:03,624 --> 00:11:07,163
And daddy wants you to come
out and be daddys little girl...

183
00:11:11,275 --> 00:11:12,463
<i>10 years later</i>

184
00:11:13,149 --> 00:11:15,710
Anybody seen my phone?

185
00:11:19,304 --> 00:11:21,427
Hey, did you see
my phone?

186
00:11:21,343 --> 00:11:22,582
It's not strapped
to your hand?

187
00:11:22,534 --> 00:11:24,658
No it's not strapped
to my hand.

188
00:11:24,575 --> 00:11:28,134
Daddy! Not gonna have
some of my french toast?

189
00:11:27,992 --> 00:11:30,436
French toast, you making
french toast?

190
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:32,609
I'm sorry I can't,
I'm running late.

191
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:34,546
Okay.

192
00:11:34,467 --> 00:11:38,902
Alright, here we go.
Mmmm, taste good.

193
00:11:38,725 --> 00:11:40,267
Thanks
- Did this is by yourself?

194
00:11:40,207 --> 00:11:41,215
You're better than
your mother.

195
00:11:41,176 --> 00:11:45,201
I heard that. Smells good.
Here, your lifeline.

196
00:11:45,042 --> 00:11:46,927
Morning baby.

197
00:11:48,405 --> 00:11:51,892
You're going to your daughters
recital this afternoon?

198
00:11:51,754 --> 00:11:55,284
Uhm, I thought you were
gonna order the DVDs.

199
00:11:55,144 --> 00:11:56,884
Video is not the same, Nick.

200
00:11:56,816 --> 00:11:59,556
Mom, its okay. Dad's gotta
work, I know

201
00:11:59,448 --> 00:12:02,644
See, its alright. Dad's gotta work.
And what does Dad do?

202
00:12:02,517 --> 00:12:04,336
Lock up bad guys.
- And why does he do that?

203
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:07,296
To keep us safe.
- Yeah, he wants us to be safe.

204
00:12:07,176 --> 00:12:09,584
Baby, get your chello.
- Alright

205
00:12:09,489 --> 00:12:11,773
Thank you so much.
- You're welcome.

206
00:12:11,683 --> 00:12:14,617
What a Julia Child (cook).
- Mmhhmm

207
00:12:15,615 --> 00:12:18,049
You know she's 10
years old, right?

208
00:12:17,953 --> 00:12:18,895
you know that?
- I know that

209
00:12:18,858 --> 00:12:20,570
She doesn't understand why
you're never around.

210
00:12:20,503 --> 00:12:24,481
This good-guy-bad-guy
stuff thats just talk to her.

211
00:12:24,324 --> 00:12:26,253
I can't come today.

212
00:12:26,177 --> 00:12:29,827
You know you have not
been to one recital

213
00:12:29,683 --> 00:12:31,655
Enough!
- Okay

214
00:12:31,577 --> 00:12:37,530
We'll get the video, we'll sit
down and watch as a family.

215
00:12:37,293 --> 00:12:40,442
I love you. Alright?

216
00:12:40,318 --> 00:12:42,378
Thank you for the toast.
- Love you

217
00:12:42,297 --> 00:12:44,423
Love you too
- Bye

218
00:12:47,603 --> 00:12:50,737
So how's Chip?
- It's Chester

219
00:12:50,613 --> 00:12:51,752
What happened to Chip,
I liked Chip.

220
00:12:51,707 --> 00:12:55,174
There is no Chip. And now
there's no Chester.

221
00:12:55,038 --> 00:12:57,105
He kept calling.
- Sarah, thats a good thing.

222
00:12:57,023 --> 00:13:00,737
I know, but I kept cancelling.
My case load is crazy.

223
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:03,127
You know you dont have to
go to this if you dont want to.

224
00:13:03,027 --> 00:13:07,255
Yeah, I do. I...
What's it like?

225
00:13:07,087 --> 00:13:09,420
No biggie. Like watching
somebody fall asleep.

226
00:13:09,329 --> 00:13:13,428
Except the not-waking-up part?
Does it bother you?

227
00:13:13,265 --> 00:13:15,523
Not anymore.

228
00:13:50,039 --> 00:13:53,763
Sarah. Your legs are looking
real good in those heels.

229
00:13:53,615 --> 00:13:54,840
What are you doing, Reynolds?

230
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:56,670
Why are you here? Your
DVD player is broken?

231
00:13:56,021 --> 00:14:00,799
Ames has no family. I felt like
someone should be here for him.

232
00:14:00,609 --> 00:14:03,045
You just getting a little press?

233
00:14:06,207 --> 00:14:08,316
Breathe.

234
00:14:20,502 --> 00:14:24,564
What I did out
there was wrong.

235
00:14:24,403 --> 00:14:28,762
I should have never
been there.

236
00:14:28,589 --> 00:14:35,050
But I swear to God,
I didn't kill those people.

237
00:14:36,130 --> 00:14:39,645
Wrong man is dying
here today.

238
00:14:40,353 --> 00:14:41,402
That's all.

239
00:16:06,552 --> 00:16:08,954
Oh God.
- Take her away.

240
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:11,313
What the hell is going on?
- I dont know.

241
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:34,509
Are you okay?
- Yeah

242
00:16:36,395 --> 00:16:38,978
So, somebody killed the guy
you were trying to kill.

243
00:16:38,876 --> 00:16:39,532
What are we calling this?

244
00:16:39,507 --> 00:16:41,584
Clear violation of his 8th
amendment right:

245
00:16:41,502 --> 00:16:42,859
cruel and unusual
punishment.

246
00:16:42,806 --> 00:16:44,311
Law school.
- Yeah. The machine,

247
00:16:44,251 --> 00:16:45,962
how does it work
on a good day?

248
00:16:45,896 --> 00:16:48,598
It's designed to
be pain free.

249
00:16:48,491 --> 00:16:50,958
Three drugs, administered
in a specific order.

250
00:16:50,861 --> 00:16:53,181
From this moment on we
are assuming that

251
00:16:53,089 --> 00:16:54,209
the machine was corrupted.

252
00:16:54,165 --> 00:16:55,506
We're gonna need
a list of all the people

253
00:16:55,454 --> 00:16:57,159
with access to
that machine.

254
00:16:57,092 --> 00:16:59,010
My people would
not do this.

255
00:16:58,935 --> 00:17:00,320
I appreciate that, Warden, but

256
00:17:00,266 --> 00:17:03,720
I'm gonna need more than
a hallpass and a note from mom.

257
00:17:03,582 --> 00:17:06,369
Detectives. Got something
back on the machine.

258
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:09,998
Let me see that?
- Right there.

259
00:17:09,850 --> 00:17:13,631
"Cant fight faith".
- What is it, Nick?

260
00:17:13,481 --> 00:17:15,959
During the home invasion
Ames accomplice said

261
00:17:15,861 --> 00:17:18,276
to one of the victims:
"Can't fight faith"

262
00:17:18,181 --> 00:17:22,164
He said the same thing to me
in the courtroom, the prick.

263
00:17:22,006 --> 00:17:24,176
I can't remember his name.

264
00:17:24,357 --> 00:17:26,280
Have a look at this.
Your guy?

265
00:17:26,204 --> 00:17:28,974
Clarence James Darby
- He's a beauty...

266
00:17:28,865 --> 00:17:31,163
You got history with him?
- I put him away.

267
00:17:31,073 --> 00:17:33,342
Ah, 3 years. Is that the going
rate for murder these days?

268
00:17:33,252 --> 00:17:35,557
There was extenuating
circumstances.

269
00:17:35,466 --> 00:17:39,097
The only extenuating circumstance
should be if he didnt do it.

270
00:17:38,954 --> 00:17:41,406
Still, three years at Marion,
fucking gladiator camp,

271
00:17:41,308 --> 00:17:43,169
you expect him to come
back a model citizen?

272
00:17:43,096 --> 00:17:45,670
Well, if you scholars wouldnt
contaminate the crime scenes,

273
00:17:45,569 --> 00:17:47,506
I could keep them locked
up longer.

274
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:49,527
<i>Authorities have refused to
comment at this point</i>

275
00:17:49,444 --> 00:17:52,677
<i>foul play cannot be ruled out.
The prisoner had been on death row</i>

276
00:17:52,549 --> 00:17:53,549
<i>for the past 10 years</i>

277
00:17:55,359 --> 00:17:58,203
<i>All we know at this point is
what was supposed to be a</i>

278
00:17:58,090 --> 00:18:02,172
<i>painless execution has turned
into something out of a horror film.</i>

279
00:18:02,011 --> 00:18:03,011
<i>Im Paula live on the scene...</i>

280
00:18:08,912 --> 00:18:11,162
Yeah?
- Clarence Darby?

281
00:18:11,073 --> 00:18:14,111
Who's this?
- That's strike three for you,

282
00:18:13,991 --> 00:18:19,909
Coke on the table, bitch on the floor.
Away from prison.

283
00:18:19,675 --> 00:18:21,271
Who the fuck is this?

284
00:18:21,209 --> 00:18:24,051
Look out your window.
South side.

285
00:18:25,655 --> 00:18:28,709
Is this a joke?
Get up.

286
00:18:28,588 --> 00:18:30,841
South side.

287
00:18:33,254 --> 00:18:37,765
Motherfucker.
Shit.

288
00:18:37,587 --> 00:18:39,245
Out of the way!

289
00:18:52,578 --> 00:18:55,704
He's outdoor!
Go. Go

290
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:57,765
Damn.
- Move it, move it.

291
00:19:06,466 --> 00:19:07,576
What now?

292
00:19:07,532 --> 00:19:09,741
Wipe the prints off the gun.
Get rid of it.

293
00:19:09,654 --> 00:19:13,265
No, no, no
- You fired six times, genius

294
00:19:13,122 --> 00:19:15,364
You bring any ammunition?
Lose it.

295
00:19:15,276 --> 00:19:18,532
Why are you doing this?
- I wanna keep you out of prison.

296
00:19:18,403 --> 00:19:21,064
See the abandoned factories?
Go toward them.

297
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:23,793
Why?
There's a cop car there.

298
00:19:23,682 --> 00:19:25,292
With a cop in it.
What the fuck!

299
00:19:25,229 --> 00:19:26,440
I tazered him, but
he will be waking

300
00:19:26,392 --> 00:19:30,330
up in under 90 seconds.
So better move.

301
00:19:46,184 --> 00:19:48,197
Rise and fucking shine, bitch

302
00:19:48,118 --> 00:19:51,955
Wake the fuck up.
Let's go. Start the fucking car.

303
00:19:51,802 --> 00:19:56,459
Okay. Take it easy.
- Do it. Come on.

304
00:19:56,275 --> 00:19:58,276
Take it easy.
Lets go, lets go!

305
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:01,535
Get it in gear, shithead. Now!
Do it!

306
00:20:17,814 --> 00:20:19,569
Get the fuck out.

307
00:20:24,877 --> 00:20:25,861
Lets go.

308
00:20:27,537 --> 00:20:28,777
Get the fuck down there.

309
00:20:28,729 --> 00:20:33,649
Hey. What about my
wife, my little girl?

310
00:20:33,454 --> 00:20:36,497
I'll never see them again.
- Fucked up, man.

311
00:20:36,376 --> 00:20:41,565
Ohh, oh oh, you don't mind
if I take this, do you?

312
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:46,216
My guardian angel.
I am impressed.

313
00:20:46,023 --> 00:20:50,581
You know why I'll never see
my wife and little girl again?

314
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,400
What the...?

315
00:20:54,196 --> 00:20:56,563
Cause you took them from me.

316
00:21:03,368 --> 00:21:05,373
Remember me?

317
00:21:07,096 --> 00:21:09,309
Sure you do.

318
00:21:09,222 --> 00:21:12,134
You came over to my house
once before.

319
00:21:12,019 --> 00:21:13,600
Don't remember?

320
00:21:15,684 --> 00:21:23,824
This Tetrodotoxin should be nicely
in your system by now.

321
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:27,712
Isolated from the liver of
the Carribean Puffer Fish.

322
00:21:27,545 --> 00:21:31,073
So, it paralyzes you,

323
00:21:30,934 --> 00:21:36,098
but leaves all the other
neurological functions intact.

324
00:21:35,893 --> 00:21:44,020
In other words, you cant move,
but you feel everything.

325
00:21:43,698 --> 00:21:47,930
It does absolutely nothing
to blunt the pain.

326
00:21:47,762 --> 00:21:50,425
And you're about to
experience more of that

327
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:53,132
than you can ever
fucking imagine.

328
00:22:02,733 --> 00:22:06,019
???, so you dont bleed out.

329
00:22:05,888 --> 00:22:08,011
You may be here a while.

330
00:22:08,406 --> 00:22:12,538
Saline solution, that should
keep us going.

331
00:22:12,957 --> 00:22:17,637
The clamps, nice and secure.

332
00:22:19,254 --> 00:22:20,913
Comfortable?

333
00:22:21,586 --> 00:22:27,398
You really are shaking.
Sure you're alright?

334
00:22:27,167 --> 00:22:28,873
You'll love this.

335
00:22:30,071 --> 00:22:31,811
Adrenalin.

336
00:22:32,484 --> 00:22:37,039
Now this, is so you
don't pass out.

337
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:43,513
There you go.
Good.

338
00:22:44,737 --> 00:22:47,623
Now what we dont want,
is you swallowing your tongue

339
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:50,200
so bare with me.

340
00:22:56,065 --> 00:23:00,498
Now this is for your penis.
But we'll get to that later.

341
00:23:01,711 --> 00:23:06,074
Scalpel, for your eyelids.

342
00:23:05,901 --> 00:23:09,781
In case you insist on
fucking shutting them.

343
00:23:10,669 --> 00:23:16,835
You see, I know what it
feels like to be helpless,

344
00:23:16,591 --> 00:23:21,344
just like when I watched you
slaughter my whole family.

345
00:23:22,356 --> 00:23:26,940
You can't fight faith,
right Darby?

346
00:23:27,982 --> 00:23:30,279
Oh! And look.

347
00:23:30,188 --> 00:23:33,965
I made this especially for you.

348
00:23:36,302 --> 00:23:41,185
You like it? Yeah, I didn't want
you to miss anything.

349
00:23:40,992 --> 00:23:45,258
Now you have the best
view in the house.

350
00:23:45,631 --> 00:23:51,300
You hear that? Your heart
is beating so fast.

351
00:23:52,664 --> 00:23:56,686
Well, me too. Okay.

352
00:23:59,058 --> 00:24:02,344
Now they get to watch
you suffer.

353
00:24:04,295 --> 00:24:07,226
They'll be the last thing
you ever see.

354
00:24:07,109 --> 00:24:11,227
as I cut off every single one
of your fucking limbs.

355
00:24:11,064 --> 00:24:12,986
See, I wasn't lying,

356
00:24:13,948 --> 00:24:18,620
when I told you I wanted
to keep you out of prison.

357
00:24:20,383 --> 00:24:22,046
That was the truth.

358
00:24:52,058 --> 00:24:54,514
Thanks for the car.

359
00:25:18,635 --> 00:25:21,446
Okay, these are all the
case files on Darby,

360
00:25:21,335 --> 00:25:24,024
I vetted through what I could,
we have crime scene photos...

361
00:25:23,918 --> 00:25:25,614
Don't want to see them.

362
00:25:26,974 --> 00:25:28,312
Okay

363
00:25:34,235 --> 00:25:37,379
What's bothering you?
- It's Darby

364
00:25:37,255 --> 00:25:39,743
All the crimes he's committed
have one thing in common,

365
00:25:39,645 --> 00:25:42,846
there was violence, but the
execution wasnt violence,

366
00:25:42,719 --> 00:25:47,684
that was, that was intellect.
- Okay.

367
00:25:47,487 --> 00:25:49,103
What are you thinking?

368
00:25:50,499 --> 00:25:53,943
Was just thinking maybe we
shouldn't be looking at Darby.

369
00:26:03,495 --> 00:26:05,707
Jesus Christ.

370
00:26:11,331 --> 00:26:13,844
Rice.
- Good news, councellor.

371
00:26:13,744 --> 00:26:15,286
Found Darby.

372
00:26:15,650 --> 00:26:18,596
I gotta say though,
he's looked better.

373
00:26:19,373 --> 00:26:23,281
They found him in about
25 pieces; no legs

374
00:26:23,126 --> 00:26:25,602
no arms, eyelids were
sliced off. Gruesome.

375
00:26:25,505 --> 00:26:27,445
Shedding tears for Darby?
- Not quite

376
00:26:27,369 --> 00:26:31,008
So your wheel's turning.
- Think motive. Who has it?

377
00:26:30,864 --> 00:26:33,075
The husband. Father. What
do we know about him?

378
00:26:32,987 --> 00:26:34,987
He owned the warehouse
where they found Darby

379
00:26:34,909 --> 00:26:36,938
What else?
- He's a tinkerer,

380
00:26:36,858 --> 00:26:40,725
little inventionist. Gizmos.
He holds two dozen patents,

381
00:26:40,571 --> 00:26:43,817
that made him some money.
He liquidated most of his wealth

382
00:26:43,690 --> 00:26:47,457
a few years ago, to buy some
industrial properties

383
00:26:47,307 --> 00:26:50,447
around airports, chemical
plants, railyards.

384
00:26:50,323 --> 00:26:53,136
It doesn't add up.
- No, it's weird, right?

385
00:26:53,024 --> 00:26:54,632
Search them all, Sarah,
see what you find.

386
00:28:08,951 --> 00:28:10,709
Down on your knees!

387
00:28:11,642 --> 00:28:13,738
Get down! Go! Knees!

388
00:28:14,623 --> 00:28:16,057
Face down! face down!

389
00:28:22,689 --> 00:28:23,550
"DADDY"

390
00:28:52,128 --> 00:28:54,454
The crazy ones scare
the shit out of me.

391
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:57,186
Is this guy a lawyer?

392
00:28:57,375 --> 00:28:58,375
No.

393
00:29:00,244 --> 00:29:03,567
He's an engineer.
"United States Code Annotated"

394
00:29:03,147 --> 00:29:05,475
Nick, look at this.

395
00:29:10,838 --> 00:29:14,032
"Prosecutor Calls Death
Penalty For Ames"

396
00:29:41,425 --> 00:29:44,127
We have zero evidence.
You better get a confession.

397
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:45,625
Did he give you any
trouble on the way in?

398
00:29:45,562 --> 00:29:47,421
No. Nothing.

399
00:29:47,348 --> 00:29:50,747
He wasn's too happy when
we took his bracelet though.

400
00:29:59,006 --> 00:30:01,512
Can I help you?
- Package for the Rice family.

401
00:30:01,413 --> 00:30:04,100
Oh yeah. Thanks.

402
00:30:05,539 --> 00:30:07,334
Mom, the video from
my recital came.

403
00:30:07,264 --> 00:30:10,769
Can we watch it? Please?

404
00:30:10,629 --> 00:30:12,062
No, not you.
No.

405
00:30:12,006 --> 00:30:14,316
Denise, we said we would
wait for your father, remember?

406
00:30:13,937 --> 00:30:16,847
Please?
- No, not now.

407
00:30:19,709 --> 00:30:20,882
Uhum. Yes

408
00:30:44,908 --> 00:30:46,009
Mommy

409
00:31:01,196 --> 00:31:02,905
Don't worry, he's just
disarming the guy.

410
00:31:02,838 --> 00:31:04,565
Letting him feel easy.

411
00:31:04,492 --> 00:31:08,596
What I'm about to tell you
I dont want anyone to hear.

412
00:31:08,993 --> 00:31:11,617
As a prosecutor Im breaking
all the rules right now,

413
00:31:11,514 --> 00:31:14,403
and I dont give a damn.
Because Im a father,

414
00:31:14,289 --> 00:31:17,703
I have a little girl.
And what you did

415
00:31:18,419 --> 00:31:20,005
Bravo.

416
00:31:22,175 --> 00:31:26,453
The world is better
without Darby and Ames.

417
00:31:26,283 --> 00:31:28,716
You're not gonna see a tear
shed from me or anybody

418
00:31:28,621 --> 00:31:30,478
in my office.

419
00:31:35,152 --> 00:31:39,695
With that being said,
I have a job to do.

420
00:31:41,993 --> 00:31:44,508
I want to ask you some very
simple and direct questions,

421
00:31:44,409 --> 00:31:48,415
I suggest that you answer
them in the same fashion.

422
00:31:48,256 --> 00:31:51,155
Is your name Clyde
Alexander Sheldon?

423
00:31:51,041 --> 00:31:52,240
Yes, Sir.

424
00:31:52,193 --> 00:31:54,336
And you wave your right
to councel, correct?

425
00:31:54,252 --> 00:31:54,900
Yes, Sir.

426
00:31:54,874 --> 00:31:57,174
You sure you wanna do that?

427
00:31:58,063 --> 00:31:59,248
Yes.

428
00:31:59,741 --> 00:32:02,865
Did you murder
Clarence Darby?

429
00:32:04,011 --> 00:32:09,090
I wanted him dead.
He killed my wife and child.

430
00:32:08,889 --> 00:32:13,108
Rupert Ames, did you
murder him aswell?

431
00:32:12,941 --> 00:32:15,712
Rupert Ames deserved to die.

432
00:32:15,602 --> 00:32:17,753
They both deserved to die.

433
00:32:17,668 --> 00:32:22,684
So, you arranged both
of those murders?

434
00:32:22,485 --> 00:32:25,193
Yes, I planned it,
in my head,

435
00:32:25,086 --> 00:32:28,722
over and over again,
took me a long time.

436
00:32:30,914 --> 00:32:35,539
Alright. I guess
we are done here.

437
00:32:35,793 --> 00:32:37,597
Councelor.

438
00:32:39,026 --> 00:32:43,167
You might want to cancel your
12:30 lunch with judge Roberts.

439
00:32:43,003 --> 00:32:45,212
Excuse me?

440
00:32:45,125 --> 00:32:47,434
In fact, you might want to
cancel the rest of the week

441
00:32:47,341 --> 00:32:50,235
cause you're gonna
be busy. Sit down.

442
00:32:52,090 --> 00:32:55,460
We're done here.
We have your confession.

443
00:32:55,939 --> 00:32:58,427
Oh, you do?
- And on tape.

444
00:32:58,329 --> 00:33:01,555
See, in our profession we
consider that a "slam dunk"

445
00:33:01,427 --> 00:33:04,353
Oh, really? I dont think so.
Lets think back.

446
00:33:04,238 --> 00:33:06,375
What did I say?

447
00:33:06,291 --> 00:33:09,248
That I wanted to kill
Clarence Darby?

448
00:33:09,131 --> 00:33:11,248
Yeah, sure, what
father wouldn't?

449
00:33:11,777 --> 00:33:14,159
That Darby and Ames
deserved to die?

450
00:33:14,065 --> 00:33:16,164
I think most people
would agree with that.

451
00:33:16,082 --> 00:33:17,582
That I planned it over
and over again,

452
00:33:17,523 --> 00:33:20,423
in my head?
Yeah.

453
00:33:20,308 --> 00:33:22,570
Who wouldnt fantasize
about that?

454
00:33:22,481 --> 00:33:25,619
None of these are an
admission of guilt, Nick.

455
00:33:25,495 --> 00:33:26,792
You might wanna
check the tape.

456
00:33:26,741 --> 00:33:29,145
We know you did it.
- Well it's not what you know,

457
00:33:29,051 --> 00:33:31,288
it's what you can
prove in court.

458
00:33:31,199 --> 00:33:32,676
Didn't you tell me
that once?

459
00:33:32,618 --> 00:33:34,976
The only problem with your
theory is that Darby's

460
00:33:34,884 --> 00:33:36,387
body was found on
your property.

461
00:33:36,328 --> 00:33:37,580
One of my many properties.

462
00:33:37,531 --> 00:33:40,078
An old abandoned
warehouse, Nick.

463
00:33:39,977 --> 00:33:42,772
Junkies, they trespass
there all the time.

464
00:33:42,662 --> 00:33:44,762
Isn't Darby involved
in the drug trade?

465
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:47,335
That's an unsavory world.
I bet you a jury would agree,

466
00:33:47,230 --> 00:33:51,217
or perhaps someone was
trying to frame me.

467
00:33:51,058 --> 00:33:54,038
Go ahead. There's a lot
of assholes in prison

468
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,722
that thought they were
smarter than me.

469
00:33:55,651 --> 00:33:58,327
Let's stop fucking around.

470
00:33:58,222 --> 00:34:01,306
Nick, unless you have
any hard evidence,

471
00:34:01,184 --> 00:34:02,931
then why are we
even here?

472
00:34:02,862 --> 00:34:05,379
Why are we having...
- What you want?

473
00:34:07,696 --> 00:34:10,524
Well, thats easy.

474
00:34:11,135 --> 00:34:13,798
You're the one that makes
deals with murderers, yeah?

475
00:34:13,693 --> 00:34:15,764
So I've come to make mine.

476
00:34:15,682 --> 00:34:20,403
I will give you a confession,
a real confession.

477
00:34:20,216 --> 00:34:22,567
You just have to give me
something in return.

478
00:34:22,475 --> 00:34:26,326
Well, you are a murderer,
so what might that be?

479
00:34:26,173 --> 00:34:27,993
A bed.

480
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:32,634
But a nice bed.

481
00:34:32,559 --> 00:34:35,534
I want a nice new
one for myself.

482
00:34:35,417 --> 00:34:36,479
I see.

483
00:34:36,437 --> 00:34:37,902
You're gonna have to
deal with that,

484
00:34:37,845 --> 00:34:39,422
because the one I have is
lumpy, Nick,

485
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:41,492
it's making me crazy.

486
00:34:41,408 --> 00:34:43,728
Clyde, I think you got me
confused with the detail

487
00:34:43,636 --> 00:34:46,338
people, see I dont deal
with prison conditions.

488
00:34:46,232 --> 00:34:48,328
I believe those cots are
bolted into the cells.

489
00:34:48,245 --> 00:34:52,527
Well that's what wrenches
are for, dumbass.

490
00:34:53,077 --> 00:34:54,754
You know one of those
new Duxiana beds with

491
00:34:54,689 --> 00:34:58,324
the adjustable lumbar support

492
00:34:58,180 --> 00:34:59,439
I've seen the commercial.

493
00:34:59,390 --> 00:35:01,628
That's the one I want.
- Those are nice.

494
00:35:01,539 --> 00:35:05,347
Cause really, Nick, I dont
think I can focus on much

495
00:35:05,197 --> 00:35:08,029
of anything until I've had
a good, revitalizing nights

496
00:35:07,917 --> 00:35:11,294
sleep, in my therapeutic
Duxiana bed.

497
00:35:11,161 --> 00:35:13,223
So that's the deal.

498
00:35:13,141 --> 00:35:17,006
Give me my bed, you
get your confession.

499
00:35:17,457 --> 00:35:19,099
Let me think about
that for a second.

500
00:35:19,035 --> 00:35:21,628
How about uhm...

501
00:35:21,526 --> 00:35:23,774
Fuck no?

502
00:35:33,333 --> 00:35:34,821
Hey.
- What are you doing?

503
00:35:34,763 --> 00:35:35,558
What do you mean what
am I doing?

504
00:35:35,528 --> 00:35:38,714
Why did you tell him no?
- A mattress?

505
00:35:38,587 --> 00:35:40,151
He doesn't make those
kind of decisions.

506
00:35:40,090 --> 00:35:41,541
Take your ego out
of it, Nick.

507
00:35:41,484 --> 00:35:43,511
Shelton's got a point,
this case is shit,

508
00:35:43,432 --> 00:35:45,056
we need a confession
and a mattress for a

509
00:35:44,992 --> 00:35:46,901
murder confession, thats
a pretty good deal

510
00:35:46,826 --> 00:35:49,459
He's playing us, Jonas.
- Well then we will play him.

511
00:35:49,355 --> 00:35:54,058
Nick. Call from the office.
You're not answering your cell.

512
00:35:53,872 --> 00:35:56,143
I need to finish up here,
and then I will be home

513
00:35:56,053 --> 00:35:58,878
as soon as I can.
- Listen to me, that video

514
00:35:58,767 --> 00:36:01,636
Nick, I have never seen
anything like it.

515
00:36:01,522 --> 00:36:03,260
Please, come home.

516
00:36:03,192 --> 00:36:05,014
Listen, you need
to calm down

517
00:36:04,942 --> 00:36:07,917
tell her its not real.
And that I love her.

518
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:09,529
Come home. Come
home soon please.

519
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:10,544
Kelly, did you
see his face?

520
00:36:10,502 --> 00:36:14,254
No, it was covered with
something, I couldnt see.

521
00:36:14,106 --> 00:36:16,698
let me finish up here
and I will come home.

522
00:36:16,596 --> 00:36:17,596
Okay.

523
00:36:18,774 --> 00:36:21,005
This motherfucker sent
a DVD to my house,

524
00:36:20,917 --> 00:36:22,985
of him killing Darby.
- What?

525
00:36:22,904 --> 00:36:24,751
My daughter saw it.

526
00:36:26,557 --> 00:36:29,824
He recorded it, we've got him.
- No, he had on a mask

527
00:36:29,694 --> 00:36:31,713
we need that confession.

528
00:36:31,634 --> 00:36:33,660
You still want to bargain
with this man?

529
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:37,743
The art of the possible, Warden.
Make the deal.

530
00:36:54,648 --> 00:36:58,390
Back problems, Warden.
The worst.

531
00:36:58,241 --> 00:37:00,939
You got bigger problems
than that.

532
00:37:00,834 --> 00:37:03,357
It's the have-nots
in here, son.

533
00:37:03,257 --> 00:37:07,086
They don't know that
I want to be the one have

534
00:37:10,069 --> 00:37:11,489
Turn around.

535
00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:18,767
I dont think he likes me.

536
00:37:19,679 --> 00:37:21,848
Nice bed.

537
00:37:23,808 --> 00:37:28,282
Thank you.
It's a single.

538
00:37:28,885 --> 00:37:31,079
We can't put Clyde
Shelton anywhere,

539
00:37:30,993 --> 00:37:32,172
not in a job,
not in a city,

540
00:37:32,126 --> 00:37:34,182
not even a country.
So I dug a little deeper,

541
00:37:34,101 --> 00:37:35,894
and I found something
from his missing years,

542
00:37:35,823 --> 00:37:38,322
a couple of contract
payments, to Clyde,

543
00:37:38,224 --> 00:37:39,684
from the Department of Defense.

544
00:37:39,627 --> 00:37:42,304
And his real estate?
- He bought 9 properties

545
00:37:42,198 --> 00:37:44,192
under his own name, then
he transfered them to

546
00:37:44,114 --> 00:37:45,473
some corporation in Panama.

547
00:37:45,419 --> 00:37:49,232
We can't get to the adresses,
lack of reciprocity problems,

548
00:37:49,082 --> 00:37:50,622
we are gonna circle back
to the farmhouse.

549
00:37:50,561 --> 00:37:54,062
That's a waste of time.
He wanted us to find him there.

550
00:37:53,924 --> 00:37:56,548
It's the industrial stuff
thats curious.

551
00:37:56,444 --> 00:37:57,594
Alright, I dont care what
you have to do, or who

552
00:37:57,549 --> 00:38:01,385
you piss off, if we have to
invade Panama again, fine.

553
00:38:01,233 --> 00:38:02,863
Clyde is hiding those
properties for a reason.

554
00:38:02,799 --> 00:38:04,897
Find it.
- Got it.

555
00:38:16,838 --> 00:38:19,309
Baby, did you leave a crack?
- Yeah, I left a crack.

556
00:38:19,211 --> 00:38:22,468
Night light?
- Isn't she too old for that?

557
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:25,108
Yeah, I left the night light.

558
00:38:24,998 --> 00:38:26,169
Look.

559
00:38:26,667 --> 00:38:28,927
I told her that that
video wasn't real.

560
00:38:28,838 --> 00:38:33,193
Some sort of horror film
she shouldn't be looking at.

561
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:36,485
She'll be okay.
- And you?

562
00:38:36,349 --> 00:38:42,416
- If I'm what, okay? Of course.
Don't I look okay?

563
00:38:44,639 --> 00:38:50,510
Nick is always okay.
Always, I'm extra good.

564
00:38:51,415 --> 00:38:54,319
In light of Mr Sheltons
economic means and his,

565
00:38:54,205 --> 00:38:57,270
potential flight risk, the
egregious nature of both

566
00:38:57,149 --> 00:38:59,752
Mr Ames' and Mr Darbys deaths

567
00:38:59,649 --> 00:39:01,705
The state requestst hat bail
be denied, your honor.

568
00:39:04,181 --> 00:39:09,705
Seeing as you waved your right
to counsel, Mr Sheldon,

569
00:39:09,486 --> 00:39:15,103
do you have anything
to say? Mr Sheldon?

570
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:17,690
Do you have anything
that you'd like to say?

571
00:39:17,579 --> 00:39:22,155
Yes, yes, your honor.
Should I stand?

572
00:39:21,974 --> 00:39:22,974
Please.

573
00:39:31,207 --> 00:39:34,430
Your honor, I'm a
law abiding citizen.

574
00:39:34,303 --> 00:39:36,571
Just a regular guy.

575
00:39:36,482 --> 00:39:38,898
I'm not a flight risk

576
00:39:38,803 --> 00:39:41,394
This is my first alleged offense,

577
00:39:41,291 --> 00:39:43,431
and the prosecution
has not presented

578
00:39:43,347 --> 00:39:46,954
one single piece of
evidence against me.

579
00:39:47,592 --> 00:39:50,563
Now, in these circumstances,
unless the state has obtained

580
00:39:50,446 --> 00:39:54,618
some new information relating
to my involvement in the matter,

581
00:39:54,453 --> 00:39:58,709
then I find it highly prejudical,
even constitutionally offensive,

582
00:39:58,541 --> 00:40:00,992
to keep me detained
without bail.

583
00:40:00,895 --> 00:40:03,006
It's a slippery slope,
your honor,

584
00:40:02,922 --> 00:40:06,604
Haven't we seen the result
of such violations both

585
00:40:06,459 --> 00:40:08,726
internationally and
domestically, case in point,

586
00:40:08,637 --> 00:40:13,701
would be Dave v McDonough
doc #0413825

587
00:40:14,983 --> 00:40:20,755
I am actually inclined to
agree with you, Mr Shelton.

588
00:40:20,526 --> 00:40:25,073
Your honor, Mr Shelton has
agreed to give a confession.

589
00:40:24,893 --> 00:40:28,587
Has he given it, Mr Rice?
- No, your honor.

590
00:40:29,124 --> 00:40:32,196
Well, then in my opinion
the state has failed to

591
00:40:32,074 --> 00:40:35,400
establish a compelling basis
for its motion, and I will

592
00:40:35,268 --> 00:40:36,863
grant bail in the amount of...

593
00:40:36,802 --> 00:40:40,426
Your honor, I will caution
you not to do that.

594
00:40:41,008 --> 00:40:43,765
Thank you.
- Excuse me?

595
00:40:43,655 --> 00:40:46,274
No, I dont think I will
excuse you.

596
00:40:46,171 --> 00:40:48,234
You see, this is what
I'm talking about.

597
00:40:48,153 --> 00:40:49,889
You were about to
let me go,

598
00:40:49,821 --> 00:40:51,205
Are you kidding me?

599
00:40:51,150 --> 00:40:54,927
This is why we're here
in the first place.

600
00:40:55,625 --> 00:40:59,238
You think I don't remember
who you are, lady?

601
00:40:59,095 --> 00:41:01,436
I would tread carefully,
Mr Shelton.

602
00:41:01,344 --> 00:41:03,137
Well, how carefully
should I tread?

603
00:41:03,066 --> 00:41:05,854
Because apparently I just
killed two people.

604
00:41:05,745 --> 00:41:09,997
And you were about to let
me walk right out that door

605
00:41:09,828 --> 00:41:12,462
How misguided are you?

606
00:41:12,358 --> 00:41:15,105
I feed you a couple of
bullshit legal presedence,

607
00:41:14,997 --> 00:41:18,696
and you go jump on it
like a bitch in heat.

608
00:41:18,549 --> 00:41:21,618
- Im warning you
- You folks you all hang
out at the same clubs.

609
00:41:21,497 --> 00:41:24,104
- You will be held in
contempt of this court.
- And everyday you let
madmen and murderers

610
00:41:24,001 --> 00:41:26,611
Back on the street. You're
too busy treating the law

611
00:41:26,508 --> 00:41:28,759
- One more time
- like if it's a fucking
assembly line

612
00:41:28,670 --> 00:41:30,966
- One more time
- Have you any idea of
what justice is?

613
00:41:30,875 --> 00:41:33,417
- You are now in contempt
of the court
- Whatever happened to
right and wrong?

614
00:41:33,317 --> 00:41:35,866
- Remove this man
- Whatever happened
to right and wrong!?

615
00:41:35,766 --> 00:41:37,624
Whatever happened
to the people.

616
00:41:37,551 --> 00:41:38,335
Bail denied!

617
00:41:38,303 --> 00:41:40,665
- Bail denied!
- Whatever happened
to justice?

618
00:41:40,572 --> 00:41:43,044
And I bet you take it
up the fucking ass!

619
00:41:42,947 --> 00:41:44,813
Bitch.
- Bailiff

620
00:41:44,739 --> 00:41:48,138
See you later, Nick.

621
00:41:48,004 --> 00:41:49,862
Insanity?

622
00:41:51,210 --> 00:41:55,537
That's what you're building
your defense on? Insanity?

623
00:41:56,433 --> 00:41:58,738
Nick, I told you I would give
you a confession.

624
00:41:58,647 --> 00:42:00,369
And I meant it.

625
00:42:00,302 --> 00:42:02,793
I saw a movie today.
- You did?

626
00:42:02,695 --> 00:42:05,285
My daughter, saw the
same movie.

627
00:42:05,183 --> 00:42:08,765
Well, you taught your daughter
about good vs evil?

628
00:42:08,623 --> 00:42:09,761
I dont have to.

629
00:42:09,717 --> 00:42:11,952
Well that's what this
movie was about.

630
00:42:11,863 --> 00:42:14,669
Good conquering Evil.
The righteous prospering,

631
00:42:14,558 --> 00:42:18,402
the wicked suffering.
- I didn't get that.

632
00:42:18,250 --> 00:42:21,228
I'm gonna give you one
more chance, Clyde.

633
00:42:21,111 --> 00:42:24,922
And dont test me, cause
I will run you over.

634
00:42:24,771 --> 00:42:26,412
Fair enough.

635
00:42:27,183 --> 00:42:32,001
You did get me my bed.
A deal's a deal.

636
00:42:31,810 --> 00:42:34,356
That was you on video,
killing Clarence Darby.

637
00:42:34,255 --> 00:42:36,510
Yes, that was me.

638
00:42:38,683 --> 00:42:42,487
Fair enough. That was me,
Clyde Shelton, on the video,

639
00:42:42,336 --> 00:42:44,960
killing Clarence Darby.
- Not good enough, Clyde,

640
00:42:44,856 --> 00:42:47,115
I need specifics.

641
00:42:48,981 --> 00:42:51,406
I took his fingers
with bolt cutters.

642
00:42:51,309 --> 00:42:53,142
His toes with tin snips.

643
00:42:53,071 --> 00:42:55,615
His balls with a hack saw.

644
00:42:55,514 --> 00:42:58,559
And his penis with
a box cutter.

645
00:42:58,713 --> 00:43:01,376
How's that for specifics?

646
00:43:01,272 --> 00:43:02,590
And Ames?

647
00:43:02,538 --> 00:43:04,728
Switching the canisters
was easy.

648
00:43:04,641 --> 00:43:06,779
Everything is automated
these days, so I just

649
00:43:06,695 --> 00:43:08,851
hacked in to the shipping
companies server and

650
00:43:08,767 --> 00:43:12,143
swapped a few numbers around
so the package came to me.

651
00:43:12,009 --> 00:43:13,983
Then I switched the
potassium chloride

652
00:43:13,904 --> 00:43:17,858
for something a little
more... deliberate.

653
00:43:19,679 --> 00:43:21,853
Well, I'm tired of
hearing your bullshit.

654
00:43:21,767 --> 00:43:24,319
I got everything I need.

655
00:43:24,219 --> 00:43:27,457
What now?
- I go home. You go to prison.

656
00:43:27,328 --> 00:43:30,314
The righteous prosper and
the wicked suffer.

657
00:43:30,197 --> 00:43:32,415
That ought to make you feel
better about the system.

658
00:43:32,327 --> 00:43:34,315
What if I had another
confession to make?

659
00:43:34,237 --> 00:43:35,524
Call a priest.

660
00:43:35,473 --> 00:43:38,051
But another confession would
mean another deal, Nick, so

661
00:43:37,949 --> 00:43:41,237
you would have to give me
something in return.

662
00:43:43,674 --> 00:43:46,980
You ever been to Del Friscos?
They cater.

663
00:43:46,849 --> 00:43:50,912
So for lunch I would love
a 20 ounce porter steak,

664
00:43:50,751 --> 00:43:53,222
medium, maybe a little charred.

665
00:43:53,125 --> 00:43:54,601
With all the trimmings:

666
00:43:54,543 --> 00:43:57,161
Pommes frites, asparagus,
butter-squash.

667
00:43:57,058 --> 00:43:59,300
- Fuck you and your
Pommes frites.

668
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:04,345
I Tell you what. Can I
have my Ipod aswell?

669
00:44:04,211 --> 00:44:06,750
I'd love a little bit of
music with my meal.

670
00:44:06,650 --> 00:44:08,066
First rule of negotiating,
Clyde,

671
00:44:08,011 --> 00:44:09,507
you gotta have something
to bargain with.

672
00:44:09,448 --> 00:44:13,011
Would the life of
Bill Reynolds suffice?

673
00:44:18,306 --> 00:44:19,727
Open it.

674
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:25,814
Who the fuck is
Bill Reynolds?

675
00:44:25,723 --> 00:44:27,454
Darbys attorney.

676
00:44:27,826 --> 00:44:31,102
Tell me you located him.
- I've got his wife,

677
00:44:30,972 --> 00:44:33,264
she reported him missing
three days ago.

678
00:44:33,174 --> 00:44:34,999
Thank you, Mrs Reynolds.

679
00:44:35,128 --> 00:44:38,934
Looks like I got something
to bargain with, Nick.

680
00:44:40,058 --> 00:44:42,887
At the moment, Bill
Reynolds is still alive.

681
00:44:42,775 --> 00:44:45,390
I'll tell you exactly
where he is,

682
00:44:45,287 --> 00:44:47,590
just bring me my meal
and my music,

683
00:44:47,499 --> 00:44:51,630
at 1 o'clock exactly.
1 o'clock sharp.

684
00:44:51,466 --> 00:44:54,486
1 o'clock, Nick.

685
00:45:06,911 --> 00:45:08,966
Hold it right there.

686
00:45:20,225 --> 00:45:21,654
It's five to 1 pm.

687
00:45:21,598 --> 00:45:24,029
I dont take orders
from him, or you.

688
00:45:23,934 --> 00:45:26,726
Iinmates dont know the time,
we tell them the time.

689
00:45:26,928 --> 00:45:31,092
I dont care, we need to stick
to the agreed timeline.

690
00:45:30,928 --> 00:45:33,319
- Fuck him, Nick.
Let him wait.

691
00:45:33,225 --> 00:45:34,783
Christ, he sawed the
guys dick off.

692
00:45:34,721 --> 00:45:37,344
Whether you like it or not,
we are on his time.

693
00:45:37,241 --> 00:45:38,940
Check it again.

694
00:46:01,888 --> 00:46:04,966
Steamed Asparagus.

695
00:46:04,844 --> 00:46:08,091
Macaroni and cheese.
- Wow

696
00:46:07,963 --> 00:46:11,886
Porter house steak,
seared, medium rare.

697
00:46:20,457 --> 00:46:23,489
Napkin, Nick.
- Napkin.

698
00:46:24,545 --> 00:46:27,502
Oh, excuse me, waiter

699
00:46:27,386 --> 00:46:31,461
You might wanna put 30%
down for yourself, my man

700
00:46:33,593 --> 00:46:36,013
What time is it?
- 1 o'clock.

701
00:46:37,337 --> 00:46:40,427
Is that right, Nick?
- It's 1:08.

702
00:46:40,305 --> 00:46:42,895
Well that's dissapointing, Warden.

703
00:46:42,792 --> 00:46:45,273
How can you expect me not
to fuck with you

704
00:46:45,175 --> 00:46:46,573
when you cant even be
honest with me

705
00:46:46,518 --> 00:46:51,319
You have what you asked for,
now where's Reynolds?

706
00:46:51,129 --> 00:46:53,599
Can I have some
silverware, gentlemen ?

707
00:46:54,383 --> 00:46:56,170
You get a spork.

708
00:47:01,445 --> 00:47:02,369
Thanks.

709
00:47:11,742 --> 00:47:13,128
Come on, Clyde.

710
00:47:18,153 --> 00:47:22,635
Okay. Here we go.

711
00:47:22,458 --> 00:47:27,248
39 degrees, 57 minutes,
4 seconds, north.

712
00:47:27,058 --> 00:47:31,399
75 degrees, 10 minutes,
22 seconds, west.

713
00:47:31,226 --> 00:47:32,708
You better hurry, Nick.

714
00:47:32,650 --> 00:47:35,446
By anybodys watch but the
Wardens, you're already late.

715
00:47:35,337 --> 00:47:36,953
Open the door.

716
00:47:44,381 --> 00:47:46,514
I'll sit in front of you.

717
00:48:06,142 --> 00:48:07,717
So, I suppose if I dont
share this with you

718
00:48:07,656 --> 00:48:11,194
I'm gonna get the fuck up,
take my right hand,

719
00:48:11,053 --> 00:48:15,525
and split your skull in two,
how about that?

720
00:48:16,528 --> 00:48:18,043
Come on over here, join me

721
00:48:17,983 --> 00:48:20,601
There's plenty to go around.

722
00:48:25,061 --> 00:48:29,340
Enjoy it. Pasta. It's good.

723
00:48:29,171 --> 00:48:33,520
What about some steak?
You like steak?

724
00:48:33,347 --> 00:48:37,504
Big piece for you.
There you go.

725
00:48:41,045 --> 00:48:41,784
Good, huh?

726
00:48:51,425 --> 00:48:54,684
What did you do to
get in here, anyways?

727
00:48:55,861 --> 00:48:59,398
I did what I had to do.

728
00:49:02,988 --> 00:49:05,604
So you got a girl
or something?

729
00:49:08,636 --> 00:49:10,822
It's a long story.

730
00:49:14,264 --> 00:49:17,480
Pilot, how much longer?
- ETA 2 minutes

731
00:49:22,328 --> 00:49:24,499
How about you?
Have a girl?

732
00:49:24,413 --> 00:49:27,407
Got a few broads back home.
- Oh yeah?

733
00:49:28,241 --> 00:49:30,344
You don't have a boyfriend
in here right now?

734
00:49:30,261 --> 00:49:31,261
Get the fuck out of here.

735
00:49:45,012 --> 00:49:47,565
It's his. His briefcase.

736
00:49:49,265 --> 00:49:50,449
Just dig.

737
00:50:03,904 --> 00:50:09,930
Jesus Christ.
- Reynolds! Reynolds!

738
00:50:09,690 --> 00:50:13,978
He's gone.
- Oxygen?

739
00:50:13,809 --> 00:50:14,609
Get something to
get him out.

740
00:50:14,770 --> 00:50:19,820
IV lines going to his...
Fuck. He's got him cuffed.

741
00:50:19,619 --> 00:50:22,707
You got your keys?
To the cuffs.

742
00:50:31,191 --> 00:50:34,037
It's your lucky day, huh?
Get some food.

743
00:50:33,925 --> 00:50:37,059
Here, take a shot at this.

744
00:51:45,073 --> 00:51:47,182
I need a shower, Warden.

745
00:51:47,100 --> 00:51:48,171
Get him out of there!

746
00:51:52,031 --> 00:51:54,228
Dunningan, what time
do you have?

747
00:51:56,218 --> 00:51:57,667
I'm 1:37.

748
00:51:57,610 --> 00:51:59,920
Took us roughly 15
minutes to get here.

749
00:51:59,829 --> 00:52:00,586
Yeah.

750
00:52:00,557 --> 00:52:03,352
Reynolds air was rigged to
shut off at 1:15

751
00:52:03,241 --> 00:52:06,301
If Shelton had his lunch on
time he'd still be alive.

752
00:52:06,180 --> 00:52:08,773
Fuck this guy, Nick.
He wants to play games,

753
00:52:08,671 --> 00:52:10,953
we can play games too.

754
00:52:11,557 --> 00:52:14,449
We need to take the gloves off.

755
00:52:19,210 --> 00:52:22,500
Hey Nick, it's Sarah. Listen.
Clyde murdered his cellmate.

756
00:52:22,371 --> 00:52:26,146
Warden is furious, he's
moving him to solitary.

757
00:52:25,996 --> 00:52:28,745
That's all I know right now.

758
00:53:22,109 --> 00:53:24,343
Found Reynolds.

759
00:53:24,255 --> 00:53:27,228
Well, it was too late,
you are here.

760
00:53:27,111 --> 00:53:29,242
I had to call his wife and
tell her that her husband

761
00:53:29,158 --> 00:53:30,982
had been buried alive.

762
00:53:30,910 --> 00:53:33,676
Well, justice should
be harsh, Nick.

763
00:53:33,567 --> 00:53:36,628
Especially for those who
denied it to others.

764
00:53:36,507 --> 00:53:38,999
And your cellmate, what
was that about?

765
00:53:42,691 --> 00:53:45,048
You murdered a man because
your lunch was late.

766
00:53:44,955 --> 00:53:48,459
No. No.

767
00:53:48,321 --> 00:53:52,008
No, you murdered him because
you couldn't keep your word.

768
00:53:51,862 --> 00:53:54,569
We made a deal
you and I, 1:00 pm.

769
00:53:54,462 --> 00:53:57,767
Now that's an important principle
I'd like you to learn, Nick.

770
00:53:57,636 --> 00:53:59,949
Keeping your word.
- Oh, really?

771
00:53:59,858 --> 00:54:01,230
Well, what principle was
at work when you

772
00:54:01,177 --> 00:54:02,654
tortured and killed
those people?

773
00:54:02,595 --> 00:54:06,931
That everyone must be held
accountable for their actions.

774
00:54:12,452 --> 00:54:15,210
You think your wife and
daughter would feel good

775
00:54:15,102 --> 00:54:18,114
about you killing
in their name?

776
00:54:42,301 --> 00:54:46,206
My wife and daughter
can't feel anything.

777
00:54:47,293 --> 00:54:49,386
They're dead.

778
00:55:24,261 --> 00:55:27,931
Hey, Nick. On Clydes real estate,
judge Stansfeld shut us down.

779
00:55:27,786 --> 00:55:31,446
He's looking for some legal
precedent Im not sure exists.

780
00:55:31,301 --> 00:55:33,142
But?
- But, I think I may have

781
00:55:33,070 --> 00:55:34,588
found a way around him,
I'm gonna call in a favour

782
00:55:34,529 --> 00:55:36,229
from a friend.
- Who's your friend?

783
00:55:36,162 --> 00:55:38,477
You don't name your friends
or they stop doing favours.

784
00:55:38,385 --> 00:55:42,460
Something else Cantrell said?
- No, thats all you.

785
00:55:42,299 --> 00:55:43,919
Jonas. Hi.

786
00:55:45,245 --> 00:55:46,756
She's thinking just
like you, Nick.

787
00:55:46,697 --> 00:55:48,133
Guess you trained her well.

788
00:55:48,077 --> 00:55:52,126
One day she'll have my job.
- Let's get some air.

789
00:55:54,006 --> 00:55:56,319
Clydes government contract
payments were bothering me,

790
00:55:56,228 --> 00:55:59,051
I pulled some old strings.
We're meeting someone.

791
00:55:58,940 --> 00:56:00,173
Who might that be?

792
00:56:00,124 --> 00:56:01,832
Someone who does some
really nasty shit

793
00:56:01,765 --> 00:56:04,231
so we can live the
american dream.

794
00:56:15,869 --> 00:56:18,390
So Clyde finally lost it?

795
00:56:18,291 --> 00:56:20,887
Somebody must have
really pissed him off.

796
00:56:20,784 --> 00:56:22,584
You worked with Shelton,
is that right?

797
00:56:22,513 --> 00:56:26,573
First of all, I was never
here, and we never spoke.

798
00:56:26,413 --> 00:56:27,685
Tell us what we're
dealing with.

799
00:56:27,635 --> 00:56:30,203
Shelton was a spy?
- Spies are a dime a dozen.

800
00:56:30,102 --> 00:56:31,401
I'm a spy.

801
00:56:31,350 --> 00:56:34,975
Clyde is a brain. He's a
think-tank type guy.

802
00:56:34,831 --> 00:56:37,504
His specialty was low
impact kinetic operations.

803
00:56:37,399 --> 00:56:39,888
Just a fancy way to say
that he kills people.

804
00:56:39,790 --> 00:56:40,872
We kill people.

805
00:56:40,829 --> 00:56:44,054
He figured out how to do it
without being in the same room.

806
00:56:43,927 --> 00:56:47,472
It was his gift.
And he was the best.

807
00:56:47,332 --> 00:56:49,779
One time we're tasking
this tricky target.

808
00:56:49,682 --> 00:56:52,417
We were using cruise
missiles, predators,

809
00:56:52,309 --> 00:56:55,135
we even had a B-2 bomber
fly to this guys villa

810
00:56:55,024 --> 00:56:57,490
to jade him. We're burning up
millions in ordinance,

811
00:56:57,393 --> 00:56:59,029
we're getting nowhere
with this guy.

812
00:56:58,965 --> 00:57:02,328
So we call Clyde. We ask
him to solve our problem.

813
00:57:02,194 --> 00:57:05,132
Clyde develops a kevlar
thread, with a high-tech

814
00:57:05,016 --> 00:57:07,132
ratchet made of
carbon fiber.

815
00:57:07,049 --> 00:57:09,979
Puts it in a necktie.
Two days later,

816
00:57:09,863 --> 00:57:12,547
Mrs Bad Guy comes home,
finds Mr Bad Guy

817
00:57:12,441 --> 00:57:16,325
dead on the bathroom tile.
Choked to death.

818
00:57:17,118 --> 00:57:19,153
What I'm saying is, just
assume that this guy

819
00:57:19,073 --> 00:57:21,756
can hear and see everything
that you are doing.

820
00:57:21,650 --> 00:57:23,881
No, we got him locked
under maximum security.

821
00:57:23,793 --> 00:57:26,980
If he's in jail it's because
he wants to be in jail.

822
00:57:26,854 --> 00:57:29,381
He's a born tactician.
Every move he makes,

823
00:57:29,282 --> 00:57:31,176
it means something.

824
00:57:31,761 --> 00:57:35,694
That cellmate that he killed,
you think that was random?

825
00:57:35,538 --> 00:57:36,538
No.

826
00:57:37,507 --> 00:57:40,320
That's a pawn being
moved over the board.

827
00:57:41,712 --> 00:57:45,103
And if I were you, I'd be
looking for the next piece.

828
00:57:44,968 --> 00:57:47,116
Anybody who had anything
to do with that case,

829
00:57:47,032 --> 00:57:49,130
he's gonna be coming
after you.

830
00:57:49,915 --> 00:57:54,280
So what are you saying?
That we can't stop him?

831
00:57:56,410 --> 00:57:59,857
Walk into his cell and
put a bullet in his head.

832
00:58:00,615 --> 00:58:03,481
Aside from that, no,
you can't stop him.

833
00:58:03,367 --> 00:58:06,139
If Clyde wants you dead,
you're dead.

834
00:58:17,097 --> 00:58:19,910
Hello?
- Sarah, it's me.

835
00:58:19,798 --> 00:58:21,556
Setup a meeting with
judge Birch.

836
00:58:21,488 --> 00:58:23,999
We need her to help
keep Clyde on ice.

837
00:58:23,900 --> 00:58:26,733
Help us with what, Nick?
The man's in prison.

838
00:58:26,620 --> 00:58:28,222
It's worse than we thought.

839
00:58:28,159 --> 00:58:32,874
Chester's your boyfriend, right?
- Chester? Yeah.

840
00:58:32,687 --> 00:58:36,490
Good. Maybe stay a few
days at his place.

841
00:58:36,341 --> 00:58:39,315
And have Dunnigan send
a patrol car to my house.

842
00:58:39,197 --> 00:58:41,553
Sorry about this, Sarah.

843
00:58:47,877 --> 00:58:50,889
I can't supercede the penal
code. You've already got him

844
00:58:50,770 --> 00:58:52,486
in solitary, a half-decent
paralegal will have him

845
00:58:52,418 --> 00:58:55,529
out of there by next week.
- We just want to limit his options.

846
00:58:55,406 --> 00:58:57,435
Give him less contact.
Less access.

847
00:58:57,355 --> 00:59:00,668
Even if it's just rescinding his
mandatory exercise for a week.

848
00:59:00,538 --> 00:59:03,048
Under what cause?
- Whatever cause you want.

849
00:59:02,948 --> 00:59:05,196
Wrap it around whatever
piece of legal doctrine

850
00:59:05,108 --> 00:59:08,776
that helps you rationalize it.
Your honor.

851
00:59:10,035 --> 00:59:13,162
So, let me get this straight.
You want me to violate

852
00:59:13,038 --> 00:59:15,409
his God-given civil rights
in the name of some

853
00:59:15,315 --> 00:59:19,666
murky sense of the greater
good, is that the jist of it?

854
00:59:25,989 --> 00:59:28,876
Okay. I'm game.

855
00:59:29,115 --> 00:59:33,202
Just dont plan on it
sticking for long. Alright?

856
00:59:36,896 --> 00:59:38,643
What, you gonna take that?
After all the grief

857
00:59:38,574 --> 00:59:40,300
you've given me over
cell phones?

858
00:59:40,232 --> 00:59:43,420
Thats one of the benefits
of being a judge, Mr Rice,

859
00:59:43,295 --> 00:59:46,279
I can pretty much do
whatever I want.

860
00:59:48,805 --> 00:59:49,225
Hello?

861
00:59:52,360 --> 00:59:54,364
Oh my God.

862
00:59:55,890 --> 00:59:56,902
Back up.

863
01:00:17,671 --> 01:00:20,114
So you're killing
judges now?

864
01:00:20,018 --> 01:00:22,690
In my experience, Nick,
lessons not learned in blood

865
01:00:22,585 --> 01:00:23,815
are soon forgotten.

866
01:00:23,766 --> 01:00:26,591
And vengeance keeps
you warm at night?

867
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:28,559
Vengeance?

868
01:00:29,935 --> 01:00:33,298
That's what you think this
is about? Vengeance!?

869
01:00:33,164 --> 01:00:35,036
What else could it be?
- No, Nick,

870
01:00:34,963 --> 01:00:38,614
I had ten years for vengeance,
if that's what I wanted.

871
01:00:38,956 --> 01:00:41,280
You don't think that
I watch you go to work,

872
01:00:41,188 --> 01:00:42,809
every morning 8:00 am?

873
01:00:42,746 --> 01:00:46,487
Or that I watch Ellie take
Denise to school 8:15?

874
01:00:46,339 --> 01:00:48,935
No, I could've slaughtered
you or your family,

875
01:00:48,833 --> 01:00:50,723
anytime I wanted, Nick.
- If you even think about

876
01:00:50,648 --> 01:00:52,559
touching my family.

877
01:00:53,082 --> 01:00:57,936
If you even think about
touching my family.

878
01:01:04,747 --> 01:01:09,371
I do my job.
I'm the best at it.

879
01:01:09,187 --> 01:01:10,121
It works.

880
01:01:10,084 --> 01:01:13,042
You were doing your job,
the way it best served you, Nick.

881
01:01:12,926 --> 01:01:16,032
The way it best served you.

882
01:01:15,909 --> 01:01:18,818
That has to change.
- What do you want, Clyde?

883
01:01:18,703 --> 01:01:21,964
Your war with the world, It's not
gonna bring anybody back.

884
01:01:21,835 --> 01:01:28,338
No, Im at war with this.
This, this broken thing.

885
01:01:28,433 --> 01:01:30,302
This thing that brought
you and I together.

886
01:01:30,229 --> 01:01:33,096
This broken thing works,
for people that are sane.

887
01:01:32,983 --> 01:01:35,187
You think doing what you're
doing is gonna change anything?

888
01:01:35,100 --> 01:01:39,602
You, and whoever you have
helping you, are gonna pay.

889
01:01:41,298 --> 01:01:45,048
I don't think you have any
idea who's helping me.

890
01:01:44,900 --> 01:01:47,291
Or what I'm doing.
- It's a matter of time.

891
01:01:47,196 --> 01:01:50,139
You see the bodies,
you see the smoke.

892
01:01:50,023 --> 01:01:52,764
But the larger picture
still eludes you.

893
01:01:52,655 --> 01:01:54,524
Do tell.

894
01:01:55,911 --> 01:02:01,664
I would like to, but
I would rather show you.

895
01:02:02,938 --> 01:02:06,602
I have faith in you, so I will
give you one last chance.

896
01:02:06,457 --> 01:02:07,457
Here's the deal:

897
01:02:07,418 --> 01:02:12,792
Release me. And drop
all charges by 6:00 am.

898
01:02:12,579 --> 01:02:15,272
6:00 am, Nick.
- Or what?

899
01:02:17,655 --> 01:02:20,699
Or I kill everyone.

900
01:02:31,456 --> 01:02:33,274
Hello?
- Yeah, Sarah,

901
01:02:33,204 --> 01:02:35,424
He has to have an accomplice.
Probably somebody inside

902
01:02:35,336 --> 01:02:38,284
the prison. We have to go
through all the prisons files

903
01:02:38,168 --> 01:02:39,534
to find some connection.

904
01:02:39,479 --> 01:02:41,064
- Do you want the files
run to the office?

905
01:02:41,003 --> 01:02:43,388
No, there isn't time.
Get everybody together,

906
01:02:43,294 --> 01:02:46,104
and bring them to the prison.
We're moving in.

907
01:03:03,526 --> 01:03:05,805
Stop looking at your watch.

908
01:03:07,685 --> 01:03:09,045
Anything from your friend?

909
01:03:08,993 --> 01:03:11,869
This treaty with Panama
is a mess. We cant access

910
01:03:11,754 --> 01:03:14,610
anything about property
holdings, but my friend found

911
01:03:14,497 --> 01:03:19,660
this loophole for access to
clients corporate expenses.

912
01:03:19,455 --> 01:03:21,096
Does that help?

913
01:03:25,206 --> 01:03:28,662
So match sell prices of industrial
property sold in Philly,

914
01:03:28,525 --> 01:03:32,220
up against purchases made
by his corporation.

915
01:03:32,844 --> 01:03:35,209
Okay. I got it.

916
01:03:43,547 --> 01:03:46,177
Hey, Nick, can I ask
you something?

917
01:03:48,944 --> 01:03:52,043
Would you do it the same
way now, would you still

918
01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:54,044
cut a deal for Darby?

919
01:03:55,448 --> 01:03:59,247
This is a job, Sarah.
We have to make choices.

920
01:03:59,097 --> 01:04:03,683
Did you make the right choice?
- We made the right choice.

921
01:04:05,495 --> 01:04:11,451
I don't know. I'm 35, Nick,
and there are things,

922
01:04:11,214 --> 01:04:14,581
possibilities that I'm not
gonna have now.

923
01:04:14,983 --> 01:04:19,754
And it's okay. And it was
part of the deal.

924
01:04:20,566 --> 01:04:24,430
Don't get me wrong,
I love working for you.

925
01:04:28,049 --> 01:04:30,413
But I just wanna know that
I gave up those things for

926
01:04:30,320 --> 01:04:33,400
more than just a high
conviction rate.

927
01:05:45,629 --> 01:05:49,791
Alright, lets just get focused.
This guy is not God.

928
01:05:49,626 --> 01:05:52,335
He's not the all-powerful,
he's just well prepared.

929
01:05:52,229 --> 01:05:54,492
We need to be equally
well prepared.

930
01:05:54,402 --> 01:05:56,384
Take a couple of hours,
go home, come back,

931
01:05:56,306 --> 01:05:59,093
and we'll get a fresh start.
Okay?

932
01:06:26,966 --> 01:06:32,506
Hey Nick. Get some rest.
- Give Chester my regards.

933
01:06:32,286 --> 01:06:37,104
When do I get to meet him?
- Oh, he's not ready for that.

934
01:06:37,987 --> 01:06:39,383
Good night, Jonas.

935
01:06:50,785 --> 01:06:52,967
I don't know how this one's
gonna turn out, Nick.

936
01:06:52,881 --> 01:06:55,062
We're gonna stop him, that's
how it's gonna turn out.

937
01:07:05,064 --> 01:07:07,945
Noo! No.

938
01:07:14,599 --> 01:07:16,306
Sarah.

939
01:07:46,014 --> 01:07:48,487
<i>In the past 48 hours,
6 officials from the</i>

940
01:07:48,389 --> 01:07:50,174
<i>Justice Department
have been killed in</i>

941
01:07:50,104 --> 01:07:52,969
<i>a series of vicious and
premeditated attacks.</i>

942
01:07:52,856 --> 01:07:55,728
<i>This marks the first time
in the history of the US</i>

943
01:07:55,614 --> 01:07:58,582
<i>where government officials,
have been, by all appearances,</i>

944
01:07:58,465 --> 01:08:01,032
<i>Systematically murdered.</i>

945
01:08:07,483 --> 01:08:10,112
Nick, I'm sorry to have to do this,
but we got something here.

946
01:08:10,008 --> 01:08:12,824
Found this.
Right outside the wall.

947
01:08:12,713 --> 01:08:14,955
Radio beacon.

948
01:08:14,866 --> 01:08:16,548
Sent an arming signal
to the car bombs when

949
01:08:16,482 --> 01:08:18,430
they went through the gate.
- Security said they checked

950
01:08:18,354 --> 01:08:19,946
every car before they
got here.

951
01:08:19,883 --> 01:08:23,171
Better check the gas stations.

952
01:08:23,555 --> 01:08:25,390
Real precise stuff too.

953
01:08:25,319 --> 01:08:27,151
Could have taken out a
lot more if he wanted to.

954
01:08:27,079 --> 01:08:29,949
What about Nicks car?
- That's the weird thing.

955
01:08:29,835 --> 01:08:32,695
It's clean. Haven't been touched.

956
01:08:33,958 --> 01:08:36,013
I gotta go.

957
01:08:43,461 --> 01:08:45,257
Jesus Christ.

958
01:08:53,342 --> 01:08:55,356
Privacy.
- Yes, ma'am.

959
01:08:57,201 --> 01:08:59,324
So let me get this straight.

960
01:09:00,115 --> 01:09:02,625
Not only do we know who did it,

961
01:09:02,526 --> 01:09:06,382
We have him locked up and
he's still killing people?

962
01:09:08,300 --> 01:09:11,850
You boys sure fucked
this one up.

963
01:09:12,289 --> 01:09:15,678
The press is gonna kill us.

964
01:09:16,276 --> 01:09:18,177
Can someone explain
this to me?

965
01:09:18,102 --> 01:09:20,126
We can't yet.

966
01:09:25,208 --> 01:09:28,218
How did this get away
from you, Jonas?

967
01:09:28,334 --> 01:09:30,244
It's complicated, April.

968
01:09:30,169 --> 01:09:33,115
He's very smart.
He's very angry.

969
01:09:32,998 --> 01:09:35,894
We assume he has an accomlice
helping him on the outside.

970
01:09:35,780 --> 01:09:39,402
I'm not having this conversation.

971
01:09:39,258 --> 01:09:43,145
I don't care how smart he is,
or who's helping him.

972
01:09:48,536 --> 01:09:50,546
Release a statement saying
we have suspects,

973
01:09:50,466 --> 01:09:52,374
we're following leads,
nothing alarming.

974
01:09:52,299 --> 01:09:56,594
Mayor, you have my word.
We are gonna stop this guy,

975
01:09:56,424 --> 01:09:59,185
he's not gonna hurt
anybody else.

976
01:10:03,190 --> 01:10:06,575
I'm assigning security to
each of you from now on.

977
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:13,088
Get this situation under
control, gentlemen.

978
01:10:16,651 --> 01:10:20,724
No phone calls, no credit cards,
no computers. Just cash.

979
01:10:20,972 --> 01:10:23,031
Daddy, are you coming?

980
01:10:25,010 --> 01:10:28,181
Of course I am.
- You better, Nick.

981
01:10:30,785 --> 01:10:33,255
Need to go.
- I love you, Nick.

982
01:10:33,157 --> 01:10:35,437
Come on baby.

983
01:10:35,347 --> 01:10:37,924
Love you, daddy
- Love you too.

984
01:10:42,266 --> 01:10:45,791
Nick, phone line's clear.
Nobody has been tampering,

985
01:10:45,652 --> 01:10:46,652
Good.

986
01:11:45,578 --> 01:11:47,228
Should have taken my deal.

987
01:11:52,009 --> 01:11:55,891
Six fucking innocent people,
that's how you wanna play it?

988
01:11:55,738 --> 01:11:58,971
It's okay. It's okay.
I know you're angry.

989
01:11:58,843 --> 01:12:00,305
That's good.
That's what it takes.

990
01:12:00,248 --> 01:12:01,299
That's how is has to be.

991
01:12:01,258 --> 01:12:03,116
What if I said you fighting
them was wrong?

992
01:12:03,042 --> 01:12:06,221
What if I had said let's
take them to trial.

993
01:12:06,097 --> 01:12:07,298
I would say you're
making progress.

994
01:12:07,250 --> 01:12:09,854
And we might have lost.
And Ames and Darby

995
01:12:09,752 --> 01:12:12,919
would both go free.
Don't you get that?

996
01:12:14,853 --> 01:12:17,937
You didn't care, Nick.
You didn't even try.

997
01:12:17,815 --> 01:12:18,792
You could've walked
out of court

998
01:12:18,754 --> 01:12:22,212
with your head held high.
I could've lived with that, Nick.

999
01:12:22,075 --> 01:12:26,831
I keep my head high,
and you will end this.

1000
01:12:28,879 --> 01:12:30,817
I've just gotten warmed up.

1001
01:12:30,740 --> 01:12:35,311
This is when it turns into
a shit total fucking war.

1002
01:12:41,215 --> 01:12:44,054
I'm gonna pull the whole
thing down.

1003
01:12:43,942 --> 01:12:45,891
I'm gonna bring the whole
fucking diseased

1004
01:12:45,815 --> 01:12:49,056
corrupt temple down
on your head.

1005
01:12:49,658 --> 01:12:52,415
It's gonna be biblical.

1006
01:13:08,690 --> 01:13:11,571
Jesus, Nick, she was
a good kid.

1007
01:13:12,685 --> 01:13:15,983
Did we bring this all
on ourselves?

1008
01:13:17,233 --> 01:13:19,495
Absolutely not.

1009
01:13:21,689 --> 01:13:24,444
You don't actually believe
that, do you?

1010
01:13:28,458 --> 01:13:29,827
Alright, gentlemen.

1011
01:13:29,772 --> 01:13:33,250
Sorry, we need to get going
to the press conference.

1012
01:13:43,544 --> 01:13:47,537
Stay sharp.
We're on the move.

1013
01:15:00,871 --> 01:15:03,219
We alright?
- It's dead.

1014
01:15:03,126 --> 01:15:04,905
Electrical system fried.

1015
01:15:05,466 --> 01:15:07,573
<i>What's going on back there?</i>

1016
01:15:09,673 --> 01:15:12,508
Dunningan, tell them to
get Jonas away.

1017
01:15:20,042 --> 01:15:22,297
What the fuck is that?

1018
01:15:24,157 --> 01:15:25,330
Get down! Get down!

1019
01:15:49,063 --> 01:15:50,341
Jonas!

1020
01:15:52,181 --> 01:15:53,858
No, Nick!
You can't.

1021
01:16:02,401 --> 01:16:04,026
Please, listen to me!

1022
01:16:07,848 --> 01:16:08,964
Jonas!

1023
01:16:09,577 --> 01:16:10,746
Jonas.

1024
01:16:30,239 --> 01:16:33,351
I told you to handle this.

1025
01:16:33,228 --> 01:16:34,705
You didn't.

1026
01:16:34,647 --> 01:16:37,061
Now we have a jailed
psycopath who's managed

1027
01:16:36,965 --> 01:16:40,124
to bring this entire
city to its knees.

1028
01:16:41,110 --> 01:16:43,843
One of my friends was
just murdered.

1029
01:16:44,807 --> 01:16:48,625
More than one of my friends
is gone, Mayor.

1030
01:16:48,474 --> 01:16:51,608
What I should do is fire you.

1031
01:16:52,064 --> 01:16:53,860
Right now.

1032
01:16:54,410 --> 01:16:56,703
I resign.

1033
01:16:57,570 --> 01:17:01,271
Is that your real answer?
- I think that's best.

1034
01:17:06,038 --> 01:17:09,912
No. I'm not gonna
allow that to happen.

1035
01:17:09,759 --> 01:17:11,639
Bring me the bible.

1036
01:17:11,565 --> 01:17:14,057
I wont let some criminal
decide whether Philadelphia

1037
01:17:14,055 --> 01:17:15,374
has a DA or not.

1038
01:17:15,695 --> 01:17:18,692
As of now you're acting
District Attorney.

1039
01:17:18,574 --> 01:17:20,608
We'll have a formal
swearing in later.

1040
01:17:20,528 --> 01:17:25,005
For now, this will
suffice. Stand up.

1041
01:17:25,983 --> 01:17:28,203
Put your left hand on the
bible, raise your right hand,

1042
01:17:28,115 --> 01:17:29,934
Repeat after me:

1043
01:17:29,863 --> 01:17:32,603
I, Nicholas Rice

1044
01:17:32,495 --> 01:17:33,951
Do solemnly swear,

1045
01:17:33,894 --> 01:17:36,232
That I will support,

1046
01:17:36,139 --> 01:17:37,336
Obey,

1047
01:17:37,290 --> 01:17:40,579
And defend the
constitution of the US

1048
01:17:53,499 --> 01:17:56,549
People aren't going to work,
kids aren't going to school,

1049
01:17:56,428 --> 01:17:59,294
They're scared.
And I dont blame them.

1050
01:17:59,182 --> 01:18:01,468
So I'm implementing the
emergency provision

1051
01:18:01,377 --> 01:18:04,546
of the Philadelphia code,
we will lock this city down.

1052
01:18:04,421 --> 01:18:08,222
Starting now noone moves
in this city unrestricted.

1053
01:18:08,072 --> 01:18:10,110
I want a show of force
for the public.

1054
01:18:10,030 --> 01:18:13,007
Uniforms, detectives,
12 hour shifts.

1055
01:18:12,888 --> 01:18:14,770
Put an armed cop on
every corner.

1056
01:18:14,697 --> 01:18:17,677
If you have to give shotguns
to the meter maids, do it.

1057
01:18:17,559 --> 01:18:19,801
There should be no doubt
in peoples minds that the

1058
01:18:19,712 --> 01:18:23,385
city is secure and under
our control.

1059
01:18:33,146 --> 01:18:37,325
Okay, Clyde. I get it.

1060
01:18:40,108 --> 01:18:43,199
Listen, that contraption
that killed Cantrell,

1061
01:18:43,077 --> 01:18:46,353
it was a weaponized
bomb disposal robot.

1062
01:18:46,224 --> 01:18:47,561
Can you believe that?

1063
01:18:47,508 --> 01:18:50,615
Damn thing had video,
night vision, you name it.

1064
01:18:50,493 --> 01:18:53,777
It fired military API
for christ sake.

1065
01:18:53,646 --> 01:18:56,436
That's anti-tank rounds, Nick.

1066
01:18:56,327 --> 01:18:59,085
I think he's saving you for last.

1067
01:19:01,546 --> 01:19:03,914
Nick, I'm serious.

1068
01:19:05,088 --> 01:19:07,343
Appreciate the insight.

1069
01:19:10,831 --> 01:19:15,412
Nick, get in front of this guy
if you want to stay alive.

1070
01:19:17,157 --> 01:19:19,795
I may have a way.

1071
01:19:19,690 --> 01:19:22,739
Something a friend is
helping me out with.

1072
01:19:22,928 --> 01:19:24,811
Your friend?

1073
01:19:24,738 --> 01:19:27,148
Man named Chester, I'll
call you back.

1074
01:19:29,011 --> 01:19:30,647
Thank you, Sarah.

1075
01:19:30,583 --> 01:19:33,345
"Hope this helps. -C"

1076
01:19:33,235 --> 01:19:36,224
"CLYDE SHELTON CORPORATE
EXPENSE RECORDS"

1077
01:19:38,011 --> 01:19:39,130
It's Nick.

1078
01:19:39,087 --> 01:19:41,730
Give me the real estate listing
of every industrial property

1079
01:19:41,625 --> 01:19:44,302
sold here in the last
10 years.

1080
01:20:08,426 --> 01:20:10,917
Motherfucker.

1081
01:20:28,314 --> 01:20:30,368
You're kidding me, right?

1082
01:20:31,098 --> 01:20:33,439
You're saying Clyde
owns this place?

1083
01:20:33,346 --> 01:20:35,792
Something about it
sticks out, right?

1084
01:20:36,161 --> 01:20:37,704
Yeah.

1085
01:20:41,391 --> 01:20:45,562
Uhhh, you'll do what
I think you're gonna do?

1086
01:20:45,398 --> 01:20:47,131
What about his civil rights?

1087
01:20:47,062 --> 01:20:48,866
Fuck his civil rights.

1088
01:20:52,484 --> 01:20:54,426
Yeah!

1089
01:21:36,879 --> 01:21:38,911
There's gotta be
something in here.

1090
01:21:38,831 --> 01:21:40,289
Yeah.

1091
01:21:56,466 --> 01:21:59,200
Remember this, from
outside the house?

1092
01:22:24,411 --> 01:22:27,823
Un-fucking believable.

1093
01:22:40,259 --> 01:22:41,743
Look at this.

1094
01:22:47,740 --> 01:22:49,020
Watch your step.

1095
01:22:54,367 --> 01:22:56,739
This guy tunneled
into prison?

1096
01:23:15,020 --> 01:23:16,942
Holy shit.

1097
01:23:21,749 --> 01:23:23,767
Fuck, Semtex.

1098
01:23:28,237 --> 01:23:31,170
Police uniforms,
other disguises.

1099
01:23:54,164 --> 01:23:56,184
He tunneled into
every cell.

1100
01:23:56,430 --> 01:23:57,333
Over here.

1101
01:24:02,403 --> 01:24:06,553
Oh shit. He wanted to be
transfered to solitary.

1102
01:24:06,388 --> 01:24:09,282
Surprise, motherfucker.

1103
01:24:50,496 --> 01:24:53,271
He's not here.
- Then where is he?

1104
01:24:58,794 --> 01:25:00,194
Nomos, what happened
to your eye?

1105
01:25:00,139 --> 01:25:02,554
Ah, long story.

1106
01:25:03,552 --> 01:25:05,067
Step right here, Sir.

1107
01:25:05,007 --> 01:25:09,503
Lets see your ID, please.
- Yeah, sure.

1108
01:25:09,326 --> 01:25:11,777
Turn around, Sir,
extend your arms.

1109
01:25:13,469 --> 01:25:15,341
Something going
on tonight?

1110
01:25:15,291 --> 01:25:16,721
The Mayor.

1111
01:25:25,798 --> 01:25:27,844
Look at this.

1112
01:25:27,763 --> 01:25:29,994
He tapped into
the prison cams.

1113
01:25:29,907 --> 01:25:32,360
Jesus, he's got
cameras everywhere.

1114
01:25:37,310 --> 01:25:38,914
Von Clausewitz.

1115
01:25:47,234 --> 01:25:49,953
"City Hall Access Card"
"PHILADELPHIA CITY HALL"

1116
01:25:52,260 --> 01:25:54,354
He's at City Hall.

1117
01:25:55,630 --> 01:25:57,303
Free to go, Sir.

1118
01:25:57,238 --> 01:26:00,286
Sorry for the inconvenience.
- Don't worry about it.

1119
01:26:01,805 --> 01:26:04,569
Better be safe than
sorry, right?

1120
01:26:05,541 --> 01:26:07,393
Get ready to evacuate
the building.

1121
01:26:07,321 --> 01:26:09,393
We'll need a tactical unit
and a bomb squad.

1122
01:26:09,311 --> 01:26:10,997
Bad idea. Have them
come in soft.

1123
01:26:10,931 --> 01:26:13,627
If Shelton spots them or
any of us we're fucked.

1124
01:26:36,861 --> 01:26:37,769
Hey.

1125
01:26:41,121 --> 01:26:44,177
Where's the tactical team?
- Coming in soft, no sirens.

1126
01:26:44,057 --> 01:26:46,402
Bomb squad?
- You're looking at it.

1127
01:26:46,309 --> 01:26:47,765
Great. Okay.

1128
01:26:47,708 --> 01:26:50,681
We'll take the north
stairs, you take the west.

1129
01:26:56,130 --> 01:26:57,645
Woah, woah, woah.
ID's please.

1130
01:26:57,586 --> 01:27:00,085
He's the fucking DA!
- Good for him. ID's please.

1131
01:26:59,987 --> 01:27:01,861
What's going on here tonight?

1132
01:27:02,428 --> 01:27:03,701
Judy meeting with
all the press.

1133
01:27:03,651 --> 01:27:07,335
What floor?
- 6th floor, Caucus room.

1134
01:27:09,676 --> 01:27:13,430
What floor is this?
- That's the 5th floor, Sir.

1135
01:27:13,282 --> 01:27:15,657
Directly below the
Caucus room.

1136
01:27:15,563 --> 01:27:16,922
If we catch this
motherfucker red handed,

1137
01:27:16,869 --> 01:27:18,765
we gotta take him alive.

1138
01:27:40,019 --> 01:27:41,389
Where is he?

1139
01:27:42,307 --> 01:27:44,378
What the fuck are
we looking for?

1140
01:27:44,296 --> 01:27:48,690
Wait, wait wait.
Right there.

1141
01:27:48,516 --> 01:27:51,143
Stand back, dont
touch anything.

1142
01:27:52,036 --> 01:27:54,808
Wasn't exactly
my first instinct.

1143
01:29:16,580 --> 01:29:20,568
It's napalm, basically.

1144
01:29:20,411 --> 01:29:23,793
This will take out this
floor and the floor above.

1145
01:29:24,170 --> 01:29:28,299
Looks like it's triggered
by this cell phone here.

1146
01:29:28,553 --> 01:29:32,015
What, so, an incoming
call arms it?

1147
01:29:31,878 --> 01:29:35,792
Yeah. Maybe 30 seconds
until boom time.

1148
01:29:36,980 --> 01:29:39,059
Jesus.
- Dunningan, what are you doing?

1149
01:29:38,977 --> 01:29:41,064
I'm calling the Mayors security.
- We can't

1150
01:29:40,982 --> 01:29:44,294
Clyde is watching. If he sees them
evacuate he will detonate.

1151
01:29:44,164 --> 01:29:47,270
We don't tell the Mayor
anything.

1152
01:29:49,241 --> 01:29:51,219
So, what do we do?

1153
01:30:01,129 --> 01:30:03,519
Wait a second.

1154
01:30:03,424 --> 01:30:06,284
We got something.
- He's pulling up.

1155
01:30:25,800 --> 01:30:28,091
Thank you for coming in
on short notice.

1156
01:30:34,076 --> 01:30:38,369
I have one simple question.

1157
01:30:38,199 --> 01:30:41,389
Why is Clyde Shelton
still in my city?

1158
01:30:43,173 --> 01:30:46,065
Now I refuse to believe,
that one man

1159
01:30:45,952 --> 01:30:51,029
is smarter than homeland
security, the FBI,

1160
01:30:50,828 --> 01:30:55,003
the Sheriffs Department,
or Philly PD.

1161
01:30:54,837 --> 01:30:56,607
I don't care how we do it,
or what kind of

1162
01:30:56,537 --> 01:30:59,592
obscure legal justification
we have to invoke.

1163
01:31:00,477 --> 01:31:02,511
I don't care what laws
we have to bend.

1164
01:31:02,431 --> 01:31:06,711
I am sure there is a provision
of the homeland security act

1165
01:31:06,542 --> 01:31:08,951
that we can activate.

1166
01:31:09,247 --> 01:31:12,463
Just get him out of here
by tomorrow.

1167
01:31:18,816 --> 01:31:19,700
Clyde.

1168
01:31:24,468 --> 01:31:25,471
Nick.

1169
01:31:26,780 --> 01:31:29,908
I wasn't expecting company.

1170
01:31:32,123 --> 01:31:34,996
Yeah, would've cleaned
up a little.

1171
01:31:34,883 --> 01:31:38,608
Never seen anybody
tunnel into prison before

1172
01:31:43,053 --> 01:31:47,192
And the solitary confinement
was clever.

1173
01:31:47,028 --> 01:31:50,925
Well that's how winners play.
We convince the other guy

1174
01:31:50,771 --> 01:31:53,184
he's making all the
right moves.

1175
01:31:53,846 --> 01:31:56,218
So did you ever catch
my accomplice?

1176
01:31:56,124 --> 01:32:00,674
Yeah, I did. It's the end
of the road for him now.

1177
01:32:04,455 --> 01:32:07,738
You played us, Clyde,
you played us real good.

1178
01:32:07,608 --> 01:32:10,122
Thank you. Yup.

1179
01:32:10,022 --> 01:32:12,110
Im glad you finally get
to appreciate

1180
01:32:12,028 --> 01:32:14,001
some of the effort I put
into all of this.

1181
01:32:13,924 --> 01:32:16,332
Well, you set out to
make a point, Clyde.

1182
01:32:16,237 --> 01:32:19,350
You made it.
- No, people still don't get it.

1183
01:32:19,227 --> 01:32:21,918
They dont appreciate what
I'm trying to say, Nick, but...

1184
01:32:21,812 --> 01:32:23,086
they will. Soon enough.

1185
01:32:23,036 --> 01:32:25,645
A man I cared about once
told me that we can't

1186
01:32:25,542 --> 01:32:27,637
retract the decisions that
we've made, we can only

1187
01:32:27,555 --> 01:32:30,213
affect the decisions we're
going to make from here.

1188
01:32:30,108 --> 01:32:31,554
What, are you trying
to save me now, Nick?

1189
01:32:31,497 --> 01:32:34,825
I'm giving you a way out.
Big difference.

1190
01:32:34,693 --> 01:32:36,512
Stand up for those principles
you've been preaching,

1191
01:32:36,441 --> 01:32:40,243
we're all held accountable
Clyde, that includes you.

1192
01:32:40,092 --> 01:32:42,803
Why don't we do
the right thing here.

1193
01:32:42,696 --> 01:32:45,542
I'm doing the
right thing, Nick.

1194
01:32:47,228 --> 01:32:49,135
You just have to see
it that way.

1195
01:32:49,060 --> 01:32:51,043
By murdering all those
people, all you're doing is

1196
01:32:50,965 --> 01:32:52,957
destroying the memory
of your daughter.

1197
01:32:52,879 --> 01:32:56,571
And causing the same pain
that you're suffering from.

1198
01:33:03,075 --> 01:33:05,727
So what do you suggest, Nick?

1199
01:33:05,623 --> 01:33:07,614
Make another deal?

1200
01:33:07,535 --> 01:33:10,563
One final offer,
is that what it is?

1201
01:33:13,456 --> 01:33:17,271
I don't make deals with
murderers anymore, Clyde.

1202
01:33:17,121 --> 01:33:19,050
You taught me that.

1203
01:33:23,273 --> 01:33:27,923
Finally.
- Finally.

1204
01:33:29,193 --> 01:33:31,934
Well done. Bravo.

1205
01:33:31,826 --> 01:33:35,114
Maybe I wasnt such a
bad teacher after all.

1206
01:33:34,983 --> 01:33:36,191
If you go through
with this, Clyde,

1207
01:33:36,145 --> 01:33:37,705
it's a decision you will
have to live with

1208
01:33:37,644 --> 01:33:39,748
for the rest of your life.

1209
01:34:02,039 --> 01:34:04,144
I'm sorry, Nick.

1210
01:34:06,839 --> 01:34:08,456
Me too.

1211
01:34:18,842 --> 01:34:21,031
Like I said, Clyde, it's a
decision you will have to

1212
01:34:20,945 --> 01:34:24,022
live with for the rest
of your life.

1213
01:34:23,900 --> 01:34:27,186
Which I figure by now is
about 25 more seconds.

1214
01:35:21,400 --> 01:35:23,550
"DADDY"

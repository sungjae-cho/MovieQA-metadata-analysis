1
00:00:42,077 --> 00:00:47,291
CITIZEN X

2
00:02:41,985 --> 00:02:45,769


3
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:52,991


4
00:03:02,215 --> 00:03:06,424
Fresh meat. Straight from the farm.

5
00:03:14,058 --> 00:03:16,208
Fresh? This body is a year old.

6
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:20,227
It's a sort of a joke,
your predecessor would have got it.

7
00:03:20,774 --> 00:03:26,065
Yes, I understand that he was funny.
Lazy, but funny.

8
00:03:28,991 --> 00:03:30,342
You said something about a farm.

9
00:03:30,384 --> 00:03:34,671
Collective farm number 5.
The big field right next to ...

10
00:03:34,697 --> 00:03:36,656
The girl died in the woods?

11
00:03:40,834 --> 00:03:45,331
I am Sorry, Were you about to say
right next to the woods?

12
00:03:48,634 --> 00:03:49,974
Did you look through them?

13
00:03:50,596 --> 00:03:51,885
No

14
00:03:52,506 --> 00:03:54,263
Now, better go back and look through them.

15
00:03:54,308 --> 00:03:55,352
For what?


16
00:03:55,470 --> 00:04:00,519
For something that I can use to identify her.
Glasses, cigarettes, whatever.

17
00:04:01,065 --> 00:04:03,299
If there Had been anything, 
I would had brought it here

18
00:04:03,341 --> 00:04:05,542
You think we're all lazy?

19
00:04:06,652 --> 00:04:09,772
Go back and search the woods.
It's after five.

20
00:04:10,156 --> 00:04:13,444
I don't care what time it is,
take an extra man, tell Sasha

21
00:04:13,486 --> 00:04:18,032
it's on my authority, comb the area, 
look under every leaf and every tree.

22
00:04:20,207 --> 00:04:22,201
I get the idea.

23
00:04:30,927 --> 00:04:33,264
Heartless, Son of a bitch,
what is he trying to prove?

24
00:04:33,305 --> 00:04:36,181
Dear Comrade. He's new.

25
00:04:43,144 --> 00:04:49,314
Doctor Mirtjinskij? It's your turn,
The body is ready for an autopsy.


26
00:04:50,193 --> 00:04:55,484
No, there's no question of how the little girl
was killed. Violent blow to the back ...

27
00:04:58,368 --> 00:05:01,737
Shouldn't you do an autopsy all the same??

28
00:05:04,333 --> 00:05:06,076
Comrade ...

29
00:05:08,043 --> 00:05:12,670
Do you help me get this job done, so
I can do your job too? Comrade Burakov ...

30
00:05:12,923 --> 00:05:16,672
What is it?
They are coming in with something for you, they want you to wait.

31
00:05:16,886 --> 00:05:20,083
Tell them that tomorrow is fine. I can't
deal with it now, it's after nine..

32
00:05:24,728 --> 00:05:27,016
Who cares what time it is!

33
00:05:41,576 --> 00:05:44,861
Have a nice evening ...


34
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:07,184
Violent blow to the back of the skull. 
Multiple stab wounds to the face.

35
00:06:07,979 --> 00:06:12,136
On the second body, as many as
17 stab wounds to the face and eyes

36
00:06:12,179 --> 00:06:15,771
and emptying
of the eye sockets.

37
00:06:16,196 --> 00:06:19,685
26 stab wounds to the chest
and a broken sternum.

38
00:06:19,989 --> 00:06:23,525
32 stab wounds with additional 
disfigurement to the breasts.

39
00:06:23,952 --> 00:06:27,820
43 stab wounds to the face alone
along with traces of semen.

40
00:06:28,082 --> 00:06:33,325
On the sixth victim's penis has been removed
approximately 2.3 cm. above the junction,

41
00:06:33,505 --> 00:06:37,253
with some additional disfigurement of the genital area.

42
00:06:37,634 --> 00:06:40,255
Some additional disfigurement ...
Some additional disfigurement ...


43
00:06:43,137 --> 00:06:46,874
Some additional disfigurement of
the nature of which suggest ...

44
00:06:47,165 --> 00:06:50,492
not so much as a sharp instrument 
as teeth ...

45
00:07:10,373 --> 00:07:13,085
Yesterday the men of the
Rostov militia

46
00:07:13,127 --> 00:07:17,670
unearthed eight bodies in
different stages of decomposition

47
00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:23,138
And you brought the odours of the grave and
rumors as evidence. How clever.

48
00:07:26,094 --> 00:07:30,849
I assume that the time you devoted to their 
examination is the time you couldn't 
spare to get cleaned up.

49
00:07:33,103 --> 00:07:38,720
Next time a little less diligence
and a little more hygiene.

50
00:07:42,278 --> 00:07:46,156
In the files
of my predecessor

51
00:07:46,198 --> 00:07:49,380
I found records of
seven other bodies.

52
00:07:49,492 --> 00:07:52,192
If you do not mind Comrade,
I would like to start

53
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:54,777
by introducing to the members of the committee.


54
00:07:55,915 --> 00:07:59,877
General Ivanov, Head of the KGB, in Rostov.

55
00:08:00,793 --> 00:08:06,667
Comrade Dunenkov, Comrade Tatevsky,
our Mayor, Comrade Ignatiev ...

56
00:08:07,053 --> 00:08:09,780
and of course Comrade Bondarchuk,

57
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:13,753
Secretary of Ideology of
the Communist Party.

58
00:08:15,476 --> 00:08:19,294
I'm Colonel Fetisov,
I am in charge of the militia,

59
00:08:19,617 --> 00:08:22,231
whose officers efforts
have a small part.

60
00:08:22,567 --> 00:08:25,463
I am also Secretary of this committee.

61
00:08:26,158 --> 00:08:29,943
Gentlemen, this is Comrade Burakov ...

62
00:08:30,409 --> 00:08:33,390
He is our new forensic expert.

63
00:08:34,288 --> 00:08:38,950
They are a breed of men who work in 
basements with chemistry sets.

64
00:08:39,377 --> 00:08:43,874
We could hardly blame them for looking little
startled when they come out into the light.

65
00:08:44,803 --> 00:08:47,133
Comrade, Please begin.

66
00:08:52,221 --> 00:08:56,440
It's clear that we have a
serial killer, on our hands

67
00:08:56,535 --> 00:08:59,474
already the most prolific in Russian history.

68
00:09:00,646 --> 00:09:03,262
We will have to take extreme
measures to stop him.


69
00:09:05,777 --> 00:09:08,502
Is he saying a "Serial Killer"?

70
00:09:08,544 --> 00:09:11,807
We understood that there were wide
discrepancies in the wounds inflicted.

71
00:09:12,033 --> 00:09:14,689
That's what he told us, Colonel.
And their were both boys and girls.

72
00:09:14,773 --> 00:09:16,799
It could be two different men

73
00:09:16,841 --> 00:09:22,086
It could be a gang.
There are no serial killers in the Soviet state.

74
00:09:24,168 --> 00:09:27,869
Well that sounds more like we
should think of it then ...

75
00:09:29,132 --> 00:09:34,091
It is a decadent Western phenomenon.

76
00:09:43,188 --> 00:09:45,683
Gentlemen, that's all we have for now.

77
00:09:45,886 --> 00:09:49,981
Thank you for taking time
out of your busy schedules. 

78
00:09:50,609 --> 00:09:55,461
I will keep you informed of any
new developments.

79
00:10:07,627 --> 00:10:11,079
Welcome to the Halls of Power.

80
00:10:11,965 --> 00:10:16,612
My God, No wonder nothing would stand.
- In this case it will.

81
00:10:16,971 --> 00:10:20,141
Why?
- Because you will be in charge.

82
00:10:21,474 --> 00:10:22,758
What?

83
00:10:22,759 --> 00:10:26,965
You'll be in charge of the case. 
Infact of the entire department ...

84
00:10:27,646 --> 00:10:29,462
because technically
we do not have one, yet.

85
00:10:30,262 --> 00:10:33,363
We have a division for the
most serious crimes ...

86
00:10:35,095 --> 00:10:38,909
and we put you in charge of the
"Killer Department"

87
00:10:42,871 --> 00:10:45,872
The "Killer Department"

88
00:10:48,377 --> 00:10:51,827
But I am not even a detective,
I am a Forensic man.

89
00:10:52,261 --> 00:10:54,550
You always wanted to be a detective?

90
00:10:56,091 --> 00:11:00,669
Yes ..
- Well, Then you're in charge.

91
00:11:01,888 --> 00:11:07,762
Start by making lists of the man power and 
logistical support you think that you may require.

92
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:12,646
And then outline a general approach
to begin an investigation.

93
00:11:12,899 --> 00:11:16,897
Report back to me tomorrow.
Good day.

94
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:34,204
Is there something else?
- Forgive me, but we reached the top ...

95
00:11:34,462 --> 00:11:37,402
regional apartment list for
forsenics, my wife and two kids,

96
00:11:37,444 --> 00:11:40,052
we are qualified for
the two bedroom ...

97
00:11:40,719 --> 00:11:42,600
We have been waitng for seven years.

98
00:11:44,358 --> 00:11:47,938
If I take a new job would I
lose my seniority?

99
00:11:49,144 --> 00:11:53,532
I personally guarantee, that
you'll get the next two bedroom apartment

100
00:11:53,574 --> 00:11:57,818
when it becomes available in Rostov.


101
00:11:59,028 --> 00:12:04,614
All right? Now go home and tell
your wife about your new promotion.

102
00:12:05,576 --> 00:12:07,117
Yes, Sir.

103
00:12:22,927 --> 00:12:27,669
Next, a special report
on crime ...

104
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:30,798
deadly combination of heroin 
addictions and street crimes ...


105
00:12:30,799 --> 00:12:33,928
is ravaging American cities
as even their own Time magazine ...

106
00:12:36,021 --> 00:12:40,019
Okay, let's hear it.
Listen to what?

107
00:12:40,485 --> 00:12:45,230
If this job is so great,
why are you so upset about it?

108
00:12:47,281 --> 00:12:49,431
I am supposed to keep it a secret.

109
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,924
I would not tell a soul.

110
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:21,802
For God's sake, you're treading dirt 
all over the place ...
- I am Sorry

111
00:15:21,803 --> 00:15:23,373
What the hell have you been doing?

112
00:15:23,434 --> 00:15:28,211
They made me move some
filthy boxes in the factory.

113
00:16:18,035 --> 00:16:27,608
I am from the Police. You are Mrs...
It's about your daughter...

114
00:16:38,841 --> 00:16:40,863
When did you last see her?

115
00:16:41,613 --> 00:16:45,564
It was well over a year ago.
I don't remember.

116
00:16:47,475 --> 00:16:52,433
She was your daughter, how can you 
not remember where you last saw her?

117
00:17:01,532 --> 00:17:04,236
Okay, Did she have any friends?

118
00:17:04,451 --> 00:17:10,036
No. She watched the trains whole day.
She was retarded.


119
00:17:24,678 --> 00:17:28,094
Did he have any friends?

120
00:17:28,808 --> 00:17:32,390
Who? What were their names?

121
00:17:37,396 --> 00:17:42,473
Did he have any habits?
- The Electrichka.

122
00:17:44,778 --> 00:17:49,654
Say it again?
- He rode the Electrichka.

123
00:17:51,618 --> 00:17:56,531
He rode the trains for fun?
- All the time.

124
00:18:32,077 --> 00:18:35,197
He finds them on Electrichka!

125
00:18:35,998 --> 00:18:40,325
He finds them on Electrichka.
I know it.

126
00:18:40,709 --> 00:18:46,130
Electrichka, The trains that criss cross rural Russia. 
- I know what they are, Comrade.


127
00:18:46,381 --> 00:18:52,467
I don't ride them, but they do sometimes
get in the way of my limousine.


128
00:18:52,846 --> 00:18:58,686
If I was hesitant to my reaction
which had only to do with a  vague unease.

129
00:18:59,729 --> 00:19:01,132
About what?

130
00:19:01,702 --> 00:19:05,869
The fact that you was only been the detective
for 48 hours ...

131
00:19:06,403 --> 00:19:10,445
and your intution is already 
so highly devolped.

132
00:19:10,471 --> 00:19:15,205
Are you a genius or just given
to power of enthusiasm?

133
00:19:16,015 --> 00:19:18,230
I know the killer's method.

134
00:19:18,947 --> 00:19:21,130
He picks up young people on the trains.

135
00:19:21,172 --> 00:19:23,861
I've been to the station. They're all there.

136
00:19:24,227 --> 00:19:28,856
The naive, the
weak, the retarded.

137
00:19:30,592 --> 00:19:34,922
It's over. He has confessed.
- What?

138
00:19:35,306 --> 00:19:40,383
- Who confessed? 
Somebody from the institution of Statsi.
A Gypsy. 

139
00:19:40,384 --> 00:19:42,468
He is gonna show them the murder sights now.

140
00:19:47,816 --> 00:19:52,774
Mr. What is your problem?  
Don't you remember what you told us?


141
00:19:56,951 --> 00:20:01,779
They are coaching him.
- They are very experienced detectives.

142
00:20:11,466 --> 00:20:14,380
Here it is, this is were I killed her.

143
00:20:19,554 --> 00:20:24,382
Again you fucked up.
This is how manyth time? Twelve?

144
00:20:24,851 --> 00:20:28,430
He goes for an appointment with the
Spring suppliers on Tuesday.

145
00:20:28,471 --> 00:20:30,882
Come back Thursday, saying ...

146
00:20:30,941 --> 00:20:33,826
it went fine and on Monday
I hear that he never saw him.

147
00:20:34,439 --> 00:20:36,329
Never showed up.


148
00:20:37,657 --> 00:20:42,698
Have you any explanation
for your miserable performance?

149
00:20:47,498 --> 00:20:50,253
I am going to take you down and show you to
workers on the line ...

150
00:20:50,295 --> 00:20:52,876
see what they think of you.

151
00:21:01,722 --> 00:21:04,601
This is the man who stopped
the chain of supply,

152
00:21:04,643 --> 00:21:07,669
this is the man who
stopped our work today

153
00:22:03,699 --> 00:22:09,289
You have no where to go?
Are you Hungry?

154
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:23,412
I hope this latest
murder puts to rest the idea

155
00:22:23,453 --> 00:22:25,668
that the gypsy boy did it.

156
00:22:27,888 --> 00:22:29,126
Why?


157
00:22:32,101 --> 00:22:34,733
Because he was in custody
when this one was killed.

158
00:22:35,363 --> 00:22:39,607
So what? It could be a
gang of which he was only a part

159
00:22:39,633 --> 00:22:43,414
We can't disount that man
as a suspect so quickly.

160
00:22:43,906 --> 00:22:46,183
He did confess.

161
00:23:01,754 --> 00:23:07,963
I have some requests to make,
we have 16 bodies and we know ...

162
00:23:08,011 --> 00:23:13,116
that there are more of them. In my opinion
it's a state of emergency.

163
00:23:13,157 --> 00:23:17,837
And for that reason I have to ask
for more men, a lot more.

164
00:23:18,271 --> 00:23:23,380
I have also need computers, so that I can 
start the library of information about the case 

165
00:23:25,484 --> 00:23:29,262
and I need to
communicate with the FBI
Serial Murder Task Force

166
00:23:29,288 --> 00:23:32,302
in Quantico, Virginia.


167
00:23:32,368 --> 00:23:37,872
The largest store house of information
about serial murderers in the world.

168
00:23:38,707 --> 00:23:42,746
And finally, we need to
publicise this case as widely as possible

169
00:23:42,787 --> 00:23:45,421
First, to warn people of the danger.

170
00:23:45,464 --> 00:23:49,904
Second, to get more of the unknown bodies
identified.

171
00:23:50,897 --> 00:23:53,551
and Third, In the hope of bringing forth a witness ...

172
00:23:53,577 --> 00:23:56,288
to one of the crimes.

173
00:24:05,023 --> 00:24:09,936
No.
- No to what? No to everything?

174
00:24:13,533 --> 00:24:15,022
Are you mad?

175
00:24:15,063 --> 00:24:18,591
There's a maniac out there who will
kill every child in that god damn district!

176
00:24:18,633 --> 00:24:20,142
Stop this insolence!

177
00:24:24,834 --> 00:24:29,580
Is there something you want to say, Colonel.
- No, sir.

178
00:25:04,666 --> 00:25:10,124
You handled that quite deftly.
- Bondarchuk is a stupid man.

179
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:14,385
He may be stupid but he is in charge.

180
00:25:15,595 --> 00:25:21,266
How can it be, you don't seem to know
how things work in the Soviet system?

181
00:25:21,602 --> 00:25:26,141
I know how things work, but right 
now there are 16 dead children and I want
a little special treatment.

   
182
00:25:26,436 --> 00:25:31,694
The strength of the bureaucracy is  
measured by it's ability to resist 
giving anyone special treatment. 

183
00:25:33,193 --> 00:25:37,736
I don't appreciate your sense of humor.
- One day you will.


184
00:25:37,906 --> 00:25:41,690
The reason I said no to your demands ...

185
00:25:43,077 --> 00:25:46,680
to ask for more men or
computers, for that matter,

186
00:25:46,722 --> 00:25:50,070
is to admit to our
superiors in Moscow ...

187
00:25:50,143 --> 00:25:52,204
that we're overwhelmed.
Which they'll never do

188
00:25:53,848 --> 00:25:56,556
To ask the FBI for help ...


189
00:25:57,122 --> 00:25:59,996
is to admit to the
West that we are behind them in both


190
00:26:00,038 --> 00:26:02,583
forensic technique and
in manageing information.

191
00:26:02,666 --> 00:26:04,637
Which they would never do.

192
00:26:04,862 --> 00:26:09,332
And to publicise the case is to admit
that such crimes exist ...

193
00:26:09,374 --> 00:26:13,531
in the Soviet Union. Which is one
thing they would rather die than do,

194
00:26:13,899 --> 00:26:17,732
To Publicly admit that anything is wrong.

195
00:26:18,029 --> 00:26:23,272
the only way I have been able to get
anything done is behind closed doors.

196
00:26:23,577 --> 00:26:28,866
By offering favors, by bribeing,
by weedling ... But that will take time.

197
00:26:29,081 --> 00:26:32,948
It always does.
Only in this case people will die.

198
00:26:33,376 --> 00:26:37,958
People will die and that'll take all our
strength to suffer these outrageousness,

199
00:26:37,999 --> 00:26:40,018
But suffer them we must.

200
00:26:40,426 --> 00:26:43,837
Because we are the people who have to
catch this monster, Comrade Burakov.

201
00:26:44,068 --> 00:26:46,137
You and I.

202
00:26:46,599 --> 00:26:52,768
And you may have noticed, no one
else is even willing to try.

203
00:26:52,770 --> 00:26:54,340
Good day.

204
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:56,929
You care about nothing more than
making your superiors happy.


205
00:26:59,018 --> 00:27:01,073
You're right, I should spend more time ...

206
00:27:01,112 --> 00:27:03,969
trying to alienate them. Perhaps you could teach me.

207
00:27:04,782 --> 00:27:07,487
You say that You and I have
catch this monster ...

208
00:27:08,604 --> 00:27:13,407
what you mean it's upto me isn't it?
Thats why I begin as the perfect choice ...

209
00:27:13,584 --> 00:27:16,454
if I fail I'll be dangling out there by myself.

210
00:29:04,231 --> 00:29:08,276


211
00:29:35,346 --> 00:29:38,714
Happy Birthday, Nadia!

212
00:30:36,653 --> 00:30:40,022
Are you trying to sabotage
what we are doing here now? 


213
00:30:40,365 --> 00:30:42,771
Doesn't you understand that you're 
supposed to be under cover.

214
00:30:43,231 --> 00:30:46,956
You're supposed to let the killer 
feel comfortable and let him try
to pick somebody up.

 
215
00:30:47,956 --> 00:30:50,827
Did you think that wearing your 
uniform would help?

216
00:30:57,259 --> 00:30:59,737
It was freezing when we came this morning
- So what?

217
00:30:59,779 --> 00:31:02,860
It is his only warm coat.

218
00:31:03,932 --> 00:31:08,090
My brother-in-law has a warm coat.
I'm sure, I can borrow it tomorrow.

219
00:31:08,131 --> 00:31:10,748
I would ask him today ...

220
00:31:12,355 --> 00:31:14,597
Give me your coat.

221
00:31:27,413 --> 00:31:29,241
Take it.

222
00:31:34,879 --> 00:31:39,705
I'll give it to you back later.
When we solve the case.

223
00:31:47,015 --> 00:31:52,354
In the years since we discovered the first
bodies, we found six more.

224
00:31:52,688 --> 00:31:55,839
and we interviewed 800 potential witnesses.

225
00:31:57,131 --> 00:31:59,430
And despite all that,
we have no suspect.


226
00:31:59,945 --> 00:32:06,468
In fact, all we've been able to do, is to
discredit the theory of the gang of retards
from the Institute, would've been involved.

227
00:32:08,870 --> 00:32:13,577
And according to some of the people in
this room, we haven't been able to do that.

228
00:32:17,252 --> 00:32:23,291
And if you continue to forbid us to 
publicise the case I can't promise to 
say when I except our luck to change.

 
229
00:32:23,551 --> 00:32:29,340
You're saying that you're no 
less than when you have begun. 
- Not exactly.

230
00:32:33,019 --> 00:32:34,763
Bring in Gorbunov.

231
00:32:38,692 --> 00:32:44,916
Gentlemen this is Comrade
Gorbunov, Special Prosecutor from Moscow

232
00:32:46,198 --> 00:32:49,483
Sit down Comrade.
- Thank you.

233
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:57,327
Gentlemen, Without wishing to embarass 
anyone in particular, I must tell you 
that I have been send here...

234
00:32:57,627 --> 00:33:02,455
to take over the investigation, 
because of it's poor focus
and slip shot execution

235
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:05,070
My superiors in Moscow agree with me,


236
00:33:05,112 --> 00:33:08,608
that we should drop the train stations 
survelliance immediately.

237
00:33:08,650 --> 00:33:11,823
Not only because it's costly in terms of man hours,


238
00:33:11,865 --> 00:33:16,047
but also because it hasn't produced
a single viable suspect in a year.

239
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:20,760
and because I say this with all 
due respect to my predecessor,

240
00:33:21,261 --> 00:33:24,872
It is based exclusively on one man's
intuition.


241
00:33:25,694 --> 00:33:28,533
Well I'm afraid that's no longer going to count anymore.

242
00:33:28,565 --> 00:33:33,583
As of now we will run this 
investigation as professionals.

243
00:33:34,329 --> 00:33:38,741
As of now, standing along
is no longer our style

244
00:33:38,782 --> 00:33:41,611
but aggressive pursuit is.

245
00:33:41,711 --> 00:33:44,629
We will aggressively pursue the suspects ...

246
00:33:44,730 --> 00:33:48,875
and focus primarly on
known sexual deviance.

247
00:33:48,916 --> 00:33:51,833
For the obvious reason they fit the
nature of the crime

248
00:33:51,874 --> 00:33:54,918
and particularly the homosexuals ...

249
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:58,884
owing to the fact that there are so
many young boys among the victims.

250
00:33:58,926 --> 00:34:02,195
And we will concenterte on a lesser extent

251
00:34:02,237 --> 00:34:07,651
on doctors and surgeons because of
the precision of the lacerations.


252
00:34:08,027 --> 00:34:12,856
Is what I said satisfactory to you all?
I Object, most of ...

253
00:34:13,116 --> 00:34:18,987
Very satisfactory.
Extremely satisfactory.


254
00:34:19,788 --> 00:34:25,127
I particularly liked the idea
of investegating the homosexuals.

255
00:34:25,377 --> 00:34:30,799
I think this is the best idea we have heard of, 
in the tragic history of this case.

256
00:34:31,092 --> 00:34:33,722
We want to thank you, Comrade Gorbunov.

257
00:34:33,783 --> 00:34:37,465
I understand that you'll remain
here for a couple of days.

258
00:34:39,142 --> 00:34:45,057
And I will see to it that you'll have enough 
time to get Burakov's team pointed in the  
right direction before you go back to Moscow. 

259
00:34:45,688 --> 00:34:51,477
I am sure I will.
- Well, We're done here, I think .

260
00:34:52,696 --> 00:34:54,569
Have I not?

261
00:34:58,034 --> 00:34:59,576
Well then.

262
00:35:16,512 --> 00:35:21,849
You've heard him. He would be here
for 24 hours and then he leaves.

263
00:35:22,058 --> 00:35:25,890
We still run the day to day operation.

264
00:35:26,104 --> 00:35:28,941
In a bureaucracy it is important to know

265
00:35:28,982 --> 00:35:32,037
which skirmishes to join
and which to ignore.

266
00:36:05,307 --> 00:36:11,214
We are developing quite a network 
of informers among the city's 
homosexual community.

267
00:36:12,147 --> 00:36:15,398
That is not worth it.

268
00:36:16,235 --> 00:36:19,210
I found it fascinating that
Secretary Bondarchuk

269
00:36:19,252 --> 00:36:21,694
so vehement about pursuing them.

270
00:36:22,656 --> 00:36:25,907
Didn't you?
- No.

271
00:36:29,414 --> 00:36:32,316
There is a whole world for gossip

272
00:36:32,358 --> 00:36:36,308
and it's in your hands to explore,
Comrade Bukarov. 


273
00:36:36,881 --> 00:36:43,132
Perhaps, If you took an interest,
You'll be a little more light of heart.

274
00:36:46,598 --> 00:36:51,757
You think a man is what he says,
Don't you Colonel?

275
00:36:53,229 --> 00:36:56,395
He is, if you talks for a living.

276
00:36:58,066 --> 00:37:01,731
A man is what he fights for.

277
00:37:03,239 --> 00:37:06,110
Well, I don't fight for anything.

278
00:37:08,245 --> 00:37:09,703
I know.

279
00:37:21,715 --> 00:37:26,424
He is a doctor with a bad reputation,
if you know what that means.

280
00:38:34,410 --> 00:38:39,950
It is as I suspected, Comrade, 
it's fornication, I made some drawings.

281
00:38:44,796 --> 00:38:46,789
Take them in.

282
00:38:48,341 --> 00:38:50,418
You serious?
Take them in.

283
00:38:51,302 --> 00:38:56,212
Why are we arresting so
many perfectly respectful doctors? 

284
00:38:57,182 --> 00:38:59,552
Because we've been told to.

285
00:38:59,593 --> 00:39:03,183
You're told told to investigate them, 
not necessarily to detain them..

286
00:39:03,438 --> 00:39:08,184
The doctors who are party members 
we detain them as briefly as possible.

287
00:39:08,402 --> 00:39:12,483
The sexual deviances who are party members
we intend to keep a little longer.

288
00:39:12,657 --> 00:39:17,485
This is arrogance. 
- I will speak to the men about it, Comrade.
I will take care of it.

289
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:22,492
Why don't you investigate the
police men, Comrade Burakov?

290
00:39:22,917 --> 00:39:27,957
Wouldn't you say that they know 
more about getting away with 
murder than any other group?

291
00:39:28,129 --> 00:39:31,712
Wouldn't you say that you yourself 
will make a good suspect?







292
00:39:39,850 --> 00:39:44,596
I know it's late, I'm sorry.
- I wasn't asleep.

293
00:39:59,577 --> 00:40:02,412
Bondarchuk suspects the Cop, now.

294
00:40:02,905 --> 00:40:05,550
Someone who knows how to 
kill and get away with it.

295
00:40:06,459 --> 00:40:12,130
I suppose it's a possibility.
The One he suspects is me ...

296
00:40:12,633 --> 00:40:16,879
That's absurd.
- I'm afraid not.

297
00:40:17,470 --> 00:40:19,522
You do not know what he is like.

298
00:40:20,409 --> 00:40:23,449
Someone could come in the
night and take me away.

299
00:40:27,022 --> 00:40:30,115
If you knew they would come 
and take you on Friday,

300
00:40:30,156 --> 00:40:33,215
What would you do different, 
this week at work?

301
00:40:35,404 --> 00:40:39,947
Nothing.
- Good. Eat.

302
00:41:10,979 --> 00:41:13,185
Pathetic.

303
00:41:29,457 --> 00:41:33,702
Where are you going all dressed up?
It's Saturday.

304
00:41:35,043 --> 00:41:42,485
I have some work. A trip I have 
to take for work. To make up for
something I failed to do

 
305
00:41:45,388 --> 00:41:49,054
Why does that not surprise me?

306
00:42:01,906 --> 00:42:07,491
I have some vodka in
my bag, would that do?

307
00:42:13,499 --> 00:42:18,706
Use your hands, for God's sake.
Help me in here.

308
00:42:26,679 --> 00:42:30,297
I'm Sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry ...

309
00:43:07,927 --> 00:43:12,221


310
00:43:30,743 --> 00:43:36,694
You Okay?
This almost had pissed him off.

311
00:43:40,165 --> 00:43:43,616
A little respect for the dead!

312
00:43:47,173 --> 00:43:50,372
I want every piece of garbage
within 200-yard of radius checked out,

313
00:43:50,413 --> 00:43:53,018
fingerprints, fibers
and body fluids.

314
00:43:53,059 --> 00:43:55,567
every can, every bottle, You understand me?.

315
00:43:55,609 --> 00:43:58,992
If we gonna fail it won't 
be because of something left undone.

316
00:43:59,519 --> 00:44:05,522
you understand what 
I'm saying, God damn it?!
- Rest assured, I will get them working.

317
00:44:15,366 --> 00:44:20,076
Okay, Let's move out.
- Is he serious?

318
00:44:20,330 --> 00:44:25,076
He's gone crazy. 
- Keep moving.
If you see anything interesting, 
You let me know.

319
00:46:35,545 --> 00:46:40,088
Police, Citizen ...
- Chikatilo

320
00:46:40,717 --> 00:46:43,042
May I have your bag?

321
00:47:00,403 --> 00:47:04,068
Citizen Chikatilo, You're under arrest

322
00:47:04,949 --> 00:47:07,325
I was on my way home.

323
00:47:07,930 --> 00:47:12,849
I talk to the young people because
I used to be a teacher ...

324
00:47:13,706 --> 00:47:16,858
I always talk to young people

325
00:47:17,961 --> 00:47:23,159
I have rope and a knife in my bag
because I work in a factory ...

326
00:47:24,551 --> 00:47:26,599
and often need them.

327
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:41,189
What do you think?
- Personally?

328
00:47:41,486 --> 00:47:46,905
I don't think he's a Savage.
Well, How do I know?


329
00:47:47,156 --> 00:47:51,818
I have some more paperwork to do. Stay
with him, okay?. Absolutely.

330
00:48:05,092 --> 00:48:08,509
I have a suspect

331
00:48:15,812 --> 00:48:21,349
What is it?
- The blood test came back negative


332
00:48:21,684 --> 00:48:22,809
What?

333
00:48:23,350 --> 00:48:27,942
Semen sample is of type AB
Chikatilo's is of type A

334
00:48:28,822 --> 00:48:31,349
I don't believe it.
- It's true.

335
00:48:31,390 --> 00:48:33,744
What you talking about is true?
What does that mean?


336
00:48:34,335 --> 00:48:38,938
Our blood test is for 11
variables. The FBI is for 149.


337
00:48:39,584 --> 00:48:44,329
How do you know that?
- I saw it in a movie! 
What the hell difference does 
it make what the blood test says,


338
00:48:44,505 --> 00:48:47,127
You do not know what you're talking about.

339
00:48:47,426 --> 00:48:49,149
Comarada Burakov!

340
00:48:50,211 --> 00:48:53,627
Are you aware that your prisoner
is a member of the Communist Party?

341
00:48:55,305 --> 00:48:59,618
Is he not aware that this man is a
Party member in good standing?

342
00:48:59,919 --> 00:49:01,731
Are you or Are You not aware?!

343
00:49:01,772 --> 00:49:04,022
Of course I am aware of it, that I'm a
detective, Remember?

344
00:49:04,064 --> 00:49:05,805
You approved my appointment.


345
00:49:07,776 --> 00:49:10,154
And you're holding him anyway?
- That is my right

346
00:49:10,196 --> 00:49:12,362
After The blood test came back negative.

347
00:49:15,826 --> 00:49:19,359
Who told you that?
- What difference does it make?

348
00:49:19,411 --> 00:49:22,947
Did you tell him?
- What difference does it make?!

349
00:49:22,998 --> 00:49:25,033
It makes a difference to me ...


350
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:31,752
Let him go
Now. ..


351
00:49:34,427 --> 00:49:38,260
Let him go or suffer the consequences

352
00:49:47,065 --> 00:49:48,857
Colonel!

353
00:49:53,821 --> 00:49:57,190
Release Citizen Chikatilo.

354
00:51:29,704 --> 00:51:33,405


355
00:51:40,007 --> 00:51:44,717
Burakov Office.
No, not yet ...

356
00:51:48,558 --> 00:51:53,434
It's strange. They force us not finding bodies,
than finding them.

357
00:51:53,981 --> 00:51:56,224
At least this time, if we found another body,

358
00:51:56,266 --> 00:51:59,819
we might have another chance to find
fingerprint, or a witness.

359
00:51:59,984 --> 00:52:06,023
In this way, I would rather find
three at a time and none in a year.

360
00:52:07,700 --> 00:52:11,367
Let's get out of here. Let's go to work.

361
00:52:37,773 --> 00:52:39,651
What happened to the boy?

362
00:52:40,293 --> 00:52:44,141
He is being held in the cell downstairs.
He is not connected to the murders ...

363
00:52:44,196 --> 00:52:48,556
but he has given us a fascinating 
little piece of gossip.


364
00:52:51,328 --> 00:52:54,327
You Let him go.
- What?

365
00:52:54,331 --> 00:52:55,830
You Let him go.
- Why?

366
00:52:55,831 --> 00:53:01,043
Why not? Gave you a God damn gossip.
Why can't you just let him go.


367
00:53:06,466 --> 00:53:08,258
I am Sorry.


368
00:53:09,594 --> 00:53:12,329
Please show
some mercy.

369
00:53:12,371 --> 00:53:15,773
He's a victim, not
a criminal. He's a child.


370
00:53:17,937 --> 00:53:22,979
All right, Go ahead. But
don't get anyone else involved.


371
00:53:24,486 --> 00:53:26,229
Thank you.


372
00:53:35,162 --> 00:53:37,486
I'll do it myself ...

373
00:54:52,561 --> 00:54:54,646
You can go in.


374
00:55:15,258 --> 00:55:19,838
You'd rather find three
bodies than none ...

375
00:55:24,685 --> 00:55:30,723
You'd rather find citizens dead,
If it would make your job easier.

376
00:55:34,860 --> 00:55:41,030
Have you become that perverse? 
- I do not think this is a 
fruitful line of enquiry.

377
00:55:41,242 --> 00:55:43,400
I do!

378
00:55:49,334 --> 00:55:55,503
Viktor Vasilievitj Burakov, 
You stand by these remarks?

379
00:55:58,135 --> 00:56:02,844
You stand by statement that you
would rather find bodies than not?

380
00:56:10,145 --> 00:56:12,518
Is this man crying?

381
00:56:24,536 --> 00:56:30,160
Is this the man to whom we trust
the safety of our children? Crying?

382
00:56:35,923 --> 00:56:40,462
Mrs.Burakov?
I am Mikhail Fetisov.

383
00:56:41,591 --> 00:56:46,218
I have your husband here,
He is having a problem.

384
00:56:48,974 --> 00:56:50,843
Yes, Yes, I know.

385
00:56:51,888 --> 00:56:56,354
I have arranged for him to take a
vacation and a rest tour.

386
00:56:58,526 --> 00:57:01,526
Can I persuade you to come and pick him up?

387
00:57:21,589 --> 00:57:23,582
Replace him.

388
00:57:27,220 --> 00:57:29,103
No.

389
00:57:29,798 --> 00:57:31,235
What was that?

390
00:57:33,316 --> 00:57:34,444
What did you say?

391
00:57:34,486 --> 00:57:38,300
After five straight 
years on the same assigment,

392
00:57:38,544 --> 00:57:42,131
Lt. Burakov is taking
his first vacation

393
00:57:42,234 --> 00:57:45,961
His job will be
waiting for him when he comes back.

394
00:57:47,906 --> 00:57:49,396
Get out.

395
00:57:50,501 --> 00:57:53,425
All of you! Right now!

396
00:58:02,756 --> 00:58:05,582
If you ever again contradicts me in front ...
I have here ...


397
00:58:05,583 --> 00:58:07,668
I do not care what you have!

398
00:58:08,011 --> 00:58:09,262
Information ...
Who cares!.

399
00:58:09,305 --> 00:58:13,989
From a 19 year old boy whom you
maintain in the town of Sakti!

400
00:58:15,946 --> 00:58:20,705
In the apartment you have arranged for him
and the gifts which you have given him.

401
00:58:21,810 --> 00:58:26,192
And the dates of your last
three over night visits!

402
00:58:27,572 --> 00:58:33,444
If you attempt to fire Lieutenant
Burakov, now or at any time ...

403
00:58:34,370 --> 00:58:37,870
I will send all this to your wife.

404
00:58:40,711 --> 00:58:46,498
I Recommended you for this position.
- I'll always be indebted to you.

405
00:59:20,954 --> 00:59:23,672
Colonel Fetisov stopped
by with a ham.


406
00:59:24,646 --> 00:59:27,457
A whole ham? Where did he get a ham?

407
00:59:27,503 --> 00:59:32,046
He's very well connected.
I bet he knows everyone in pork.

408
00:59:34,219 --> 00:59:39,509
He is very proud of himself, 
for defending you.

409
00:59:39,724 --> 00:59:44,514
I think, he feels that,
he has finally earned your respect. 
Has he?

410
00:59:45,061 --> 00:59:50,483
Will you tell him when you go back to work?
I think it would mean a lot to him.

411
00:59:54,237 --> 00:59:57,653
I knew, I could talk you into it.

412
01:00:18,053 --> 01:00:22,797
Lieutenant Burakov, You're 10 days early.
- I feel much better.

413
01:00:23,099 --> 01:00:28,141
I am glad. You haven't been home?
I came to see you first.

414
01:00:28,396 --> 01:00:33,059
I want to thank you for taking care
of my family while I was away.

415
01:00:34,528 --> 01:00:37,086
And for saving my job.

416
01:00:38,224 --> 01:00:42,277
You were right by knowing which 
skirmishes to ignore.

417
01:00:42,328 --> 01:00:47,533
Not really. I have just, 
when you spent enough time with the lion ...

418
01:00:47,873 --> 01:00:52,002
the idea of roaring, starts becoming
more and more reasonable. 

419
01:00:55,757 --> 01:01:00,585
There is something I wanted to ask you about.
- What is it?

420
01:01:01,887 --> 01:01:07,013
While I was away
I spoke to a psychiatrist.

421
01:01:07,310 --> 01:01:12,897
I would like to bring one into the case.
Maybe you know someone from the Institute.

422
01:01:18,361 --> 01:01:22,161
You are aware, I am sure that, 
never in the history of the...

423
01:01:22,202 --> 01:01:24,656
Soviet Union
As a Psychiatrist ...

424
01:01:24,701 --> 01:01:30,256
been brought into a murder case.
- I know. You will be the first ...

425
01:01:31,374 --> 01:01:33,620
to make history.

426
01:01:38,090 --> 01:01:43,334
What? - Did you just come in here and
go out of your way to make me feel good ...

427
01:01:43,471 --> 01:01:46,305
and ask me for something?

428
01:01:48,056 --> 01:01:51,248
My God, You are learning
how to manipulate people.

429
01:01:52,278 --> 01:01:55,262
I've created a monster.

430
01:01:57,022 --> 01:02:02,942
What about the psychiatrist?
- I'll see what I can do. All right?

431
01:02:04,114 --> 01:02:09,025
Thank you. - Now you wants to go
home or prefer to stay here?

432
01:02:09,026 --> 01:02:11,112
Come In.

433
01:02:11,113 --> 01:02:15,284
Colonel is ...
Okay.

434
01:02:15,285 --> 01:02:17,370
There is another body in the woods.

435
01:02:17,419 --> 01:02:21,961
Your timing is impeccable.
- I'm ready.

436
01:02:52,494 --> 01:02:57,037
What's that about?
He likes to examine the terrain a little before 

437
01:02:57,207 --> 01:03:01,870
rest of us get in there
and stomp around much.
- That's smart.

438
01:03:02,421 --> 01:03:08,175
It doesn't do too much damage. So you
would say that he's a good detective?

439
01:03:08,427 --> 01:03:13,255
I will  say that I never worked
with anyone as good. Excuse me.

440
01:03:28,696 --> 01:03:31,516
Can I explain about the evidence?

441
01:03:31,558 --> 01:03:36,039
We start with any physical evidence on
or adjacent to the body ...

442
01:03:38,331 --> 01:03:40,493
Make a cast of this?

443
01:03:42,949 --> 01:03:45,578
I'll have it to you by six.

444
01:03:55,276 --> 01:03:58,709
I know it is irregular,
but I hope one or two of you,  


445
01:03:58,751 --> 01:04:03,688
would be interested enough in what 
we said today to get involved.

446
01:04:05,566 --> 01:04:10,727
If you are, Please Stay. Thank you.

447
01:04:41,893 --> 01:04:47,564
It's embarrassing to see grown men
run from their responsibilities.

448
01:04:47,815 --> 01:04:52,228
It's like seeing your parents
drunk for the first time.

449
01:04:55,197 --> 01:05:00,783
They're afraid. To be a
Psychiatrist in this country ...

450
01:05:01,035 --> 01:05:06,623
is to be an expert for
paranoia, whether you meant to be or not.

451
01:05:09,936 --> 01:05:12,181
Why are you frightened?

452
01:05:13,420 --> 01:05:18,062
I am Sorry. 
Do I look like a man of courage to you?

453
01:05:22,057 --> 01:05:24,630
I am Bukhanovsky.

454
01:05:26,207 --> 01:05:29,901
Well I was always been interested
in abnormal psychology.

455
01:05:30,393 --> 01:05:33,896
Which is a dangerous thing
in the Soviet state.

456
01:05:34,776 --> 01:05:40,779
Anyway, I was fascinated by the pattern
of disfigurement you described.

457
01:05:41,784 --> 01:05:47,989
I would like to try to help, but discreetly.
I would like to think about it for a while.

458
01:05:48,333 --> 01:05:53,161
Then write my ideas down
If I have it and then send it along.

459
01:05:53,338 --> 01:05:56,292
Is that will be all right?
- Good..

460
01:05:57,050 --> 01:06:02,884
I would like to be as cautious as possible
not to risk my career.

461
01:06:04,014 --> 01:06:10,417
My God, being a hero is enormously
taxing and I've only been doing 
it only for 7 or 8 minutes ...
 



462
01:06:10,812 --> 01:06:14,977
and already I feel strangely enervated.

463
01:06:17,653 --> 01:06:19,481
You ...

464
01:06:21,574 --> 01:06:26,651
What is it?
- You must live with a great deal of pressure.

465
01:06:29,413 --> 01:06:34,159
It's all right, now you know?
What is it?

466
01:06:34,419 --> 01:06:39,924
The slaughter and all these horrors, 
It reveals the monster which 
we all have in our selves.

467
01:07:24,508 --> 01:07:27,629
PLEASE READ THIS.
M. FETIZOV.

468
01:07:28,596 --> 01:07:30,589
CITIZEN 'X'
by Bukhanovsky.


469
01:07:39,939 --> 01:07:45,729
I read the whole thing last night.
It is very intuitive, well-defended.

470
01:07:46,029 --> 01:07:51,783
There is little chace of that he is
homosexual. A man with a wife and kids.

471
01:07:52,286 --> 01:07:57,873
And the sexual problem.
And maybe a job working with young kids ...

472
01:07:58,418 --> 01:08:02,083
a worker in a chidrens home or can be a teacher.

473
01:08:08,467 --> 01:08:11,587
We will had to have someone
go through these kind of files again.

474
01:08:14,558 --> 01:08:17,409
This is interesting speculation,
but certainly

475
01:08:17,451 --> 01:08:21,622
not good enough, to persuade me to change 
the goals of the investigation.

476
01:08:22,482 --> 01:08:26,669
Not the goals, Comrade.
Just the methods.

477
01:08:28,865 --> 01:08:31,948
But just continue
arresting the homosexuals ...


478
01:08:32,201 --> 01:08:35,697
it may not be directly contributing
to the resolution of the case.

479
01:08:37,172 --> 01:08:40,251
But we will still be doing
the society a service.

480
01:08:55,933 --> 01:08:58,009


481
01:08:58,477 --> 01:09:03,139
Under the new policy of perstroika. 
Soviet leaders have agreed yesterday



482
01:09:03,524 --> 01:09:06,973
to surrender the partys  
72 year monopoly on power.

483
01:09:07,693 --> 01:09:10,521
The American President
George Bush congratulated ...

484
01:09:10,562 --> 01:09:14,384
The President, for his commitment to
democratic reform ...


485
01:09:14,426 --> 01:09:19,153
and to ensure him that the hopes of the 
American people are with us

486
01:09:19,194 --> 01:09:22,603
as we chart the new course 
of the Soviet state.

487
01:09:24,544 --> 01:09:28,209
Thank you.
- Will it change things?

488
01:09:29,089 --> 01:09:33,502
I don't know yet. I was on the
telephone since midnight.

489
01:09:33,761 --> 01:09:38,633
Just keep the attitude alright and we'll see.
Can you get him for me?

490
01:09:51,610 --> 01:09:57,031
We've to talk. Not
now, tomorrow, in the office.

491
01:09:57,240 --> 01:10:01,535
Why? What is it?
- Tomorrow morning.

492
01:10:01,745 --> 01:10:05,280
Don't make me suffer Colonel.

493
01:10:05,833 --> 01:10:08,803
There will be a new Head of the Investigation
by tomorrow morning,

494
01:10:10,055 --> 01:10:12,956
Come to the committee room at eight and
We'll meet him together.

495
01:10:13,046 --> 01:10:16,581
Who is it? - It is not decided yet.
I'm flying to Moscow right now ...

496
01:10:16,884 --> 01:10:21,629
to see if I can influence their
decision. That's why I stopped to tell you.

497
01:10:22,348 --> 01:10:27,390
Don't start worrying yet.
Have I ever let you down?

498
01:10:30,649 --> 01:10:33,318
Thank you so much for your support.

499
01:10:36,405 --> 01:10:38,859
I'll see you tomorrow morning.

500
01:10:42,451 --> 01:10:44,692
Good luck!

501
01:11:13,690 --> 01:11:16,730
Where are they?.
- Who?

502
01:11:16,731 --> 01:11:18,711
The committee.


503
01:11:18,713 --> 01:11:20,799
We're it.

504
01:11:21,240 --> 01:11:25,569
Who is the new head of Investigation?
- You.

505
01:11:29,415 --> 01:11:35,619
Congratulations, Colonel.
- Actually, I'm a General now.

506
01:11:36,505 --> 01:11:41,745
I don't have my insignia yet,
but they're on order.

507
01:11:43,051 --> 01:11:48,971
Congratulations General.
You're a Colonel.

508
01:11:50,225 --> 01:11:53,345
Congratulations Colonel.

509
01:11:54,605 --> 01:11:58,438
Now, Sit down, let us get started.

510
01:12:03,448 --> 01:12:08,952
I am now the prefect of the militia for the 
entire operation. Reporting only to Moscow.

511
01:12:09,204 --> 01:12:15,304
I can allocate my forces anywhere 
I see fit, and I'm considering 
this case, my highest priority.

512
01:12:16,416 --> 01:12:22,503
If you need men, you need publicity,
you need communications. You have it.

513
01:12:26,301 --> 01:12:30,596
I bought these in Moscow yesterday, 
they are fantastic.

514
01:12:30,974 --> 01:12:35,443
You have a telephone appointment
tonight at midnight

515
01:12:35,485 --> 01:12:37,933
to speak with the Head of the
FBI ...

516
01:12:37,974 --> 01:12:41,040
Serial Murderer Task Force
Special Agent Beckford.

517
01:12:42,110 --> 01:12:47,980
He told me late last night, that he has been
following your work on this case with 
great interest for about five years ...


518
01:12:48,322 --> 01:12:52,403
I didn't ask him how.

519
01:12:53,119 --> 01:12:56,060
He considers you as a
man of iron will.

520
01:12:56,288 --> 01:12:59,536
For what it is worth, I agree with him

521
01:13:00,294 --> 01:13:06,250
He also told me that he rotates his people 
of the Serial Murderers cases ...

522
01:13:06,468 --> 01:13:10,050
every 18 months, whether they like it or not ...

523
01:13:10,346 --> 01:13:15,338
to prevent the inevitable psychological 
consequences of too much frustration.

524
01:13:15,975 --> 01:13:21,764
I pretended that I had known that all along.
He thinks that I pushed you ...

525
01:13:22,023 --> 01:13:28,144
and pushed you in search of your limits.
Until I realized that you hadn't have any.

526
01:13:28,655 --> 01:13:34,858
Privately I offer my deepest
apologies to you and your wife.

527
01:13:35,161 --> 01:13:40,701
I hope that someday you can forgive
me my ignorance. Anyway ...

528
01:13:41,668 --> 01:13:46,869
he suggested that I will not tell you this
but ... He said that he starts a new ...

529
01:13:46,911 --> 01:13:50,371
group of recruits through the
program every 16 weeks.

530
01:13:50,414 --> 01:13:55,439
And the first lecture that he gives,
It's always about you.


531
01:13:55,805 --> 01:14:00,468
He calls you "The one man in the world
he would least like to have after him "


532
01:14:00,727 --> 01:14:03,757
"An Intelligent, Methodical, Painstaking, 
Passionate detective, who would 

533
01:14:03,799 --> 01:14:06,359
rather die than
give up "

534
01:14:06,859 --> 01:14:09,529
Again, I agree.

535
01:14:17,035 --> 01:14:22,574
Colonel Burakov ...
I'm Sorry, you may go.

536
01:14:47,980 --> 01:14:53,222
I have a plan.
I've been thinking about it for a long time.

537
01:14:56,155 --> 01:14:57,946


538
01:14:57,157 --> 01:15:04,114
We intend to have a visible uniform
presence 24 hours a day ...

539
01:15:04,456 --> 01:15:09,451
in every single train station
within 50 miles of Rostov.

540
01:15:09,711 --> 01:15:13,422
Every station, except three.

541
01:15:13,701 --> 01:15:17,815
The three smaller stations of the
Matievs line in the Katma forest.

542
01:15:18,429 --> 01:15:21,277
There we will have only
under cover men.


543
01:15:21,814 --> 01:15:23,731
That's where we want him
to make his next ...

544
01:15:23,772 --> 01:15:26,612
attempt to kill
one of our children.

545
01:15:27,728 --> 01:15:33,351
In order for this plan to work,
we need you to do a job.

546
01:15:33,692 --> 01:15:39,565
We need you to accost anyone
who stops to talk to a child or a young woman.

547
01:15:39,656 --> 01:15:42,674
Anyone who stops to
talk to any stranger at all.

548
01:15:42,998 --> 01:15:45,675
We need to demand their
identity cards.

549
01:15:45,716 --> 01:15:48,877
and ask their business and take down 
their answers in your note books

550
01:15:48,918 --> 01:15:52,132
We need to search them.

551
01:15:52,618 --> 01:15:56,708
And above all,
we need to do this visibly.

552
01:15:56,749 --> 01:16:00,806
We need everyone in the
station to notice.

553
01:16:01,636 --> 01:16:03,379
Understand?

554
01:16:06,767 --> 01:16:10,895
What you said, I didn't hear that.
- Yes, Comrade General.

555
01:16:11,855 --> 01:16:15,271
Again.
- Yes, Comrade General!

556
01:16:15,985 --> 01:16:21,653
Do you believe that you are capable
of performing these tasks? 
- Yes, Comrade General!

557
01:16:22,572 --> 01:16:28,658
Do you think that you're capable 
of perfoming them without subtlety?
- Yes, Comrade General!

558
01:16:28,913 --> 01:16:32,642
Without discretion?
Yes, Comrade General!

559
01:16:33,464 --> 01:16:37,839
Without tact?
- Yes, Comrade General!

560
01:16:37,840 --> 01:16:39,883
Good.


561
01:17:02,070 --> 01:17:08,104
It wasn't long ago, if a cop took a 
big chance like this and failed, 
he'd have been shot.

562
01:17:09,245 --> 01:17:12,413
For your sake, I hope it works.

563
01:17:12,833 --> 01:17:17,126
I will not let them shoot you,
Not before a trial ...

564
01:19:13,498 --> 01:19:14,846
It started very well.

565
01:19:14,888 --> 01:19:18,361
But it's only just seven weeks
and already we're getting lazy.


566
01:19:18,412 --> 01:19:20,887
And reports of one of the
stations reads no suspcious characters

567
01:19:20,929 --> 01:19:23,811
in 3 days. 3 days!


568
01:19:23,918 --> 01:19:28,628
The whole idea is to stay visible.
- Surprise Inspection would come?

569
01:19:30,089 --> 01:19:32,419
What I am saying is
keep up the pressure,

570
01:19:32,461 --> 01:19:35,844
Okay. I'll let you
know a little secret.

571
01:19:35,887 --> 01:19:40,383
Surprise inspection in half an hour.
Tell your men.

572
01:19:41,226 --> 01:19:44,207
That defeat the purpose of the "surprise"

573
01:19:44,249 --> 01:19:48,343
As for that station. You have to give 
them a little sugar once in a while anyway. 


574
01:19:54,614 --> 01:19:57,532
Your interrogation slips.

575
01:20:08,749 --> 01:20:09,995
Okay.

576
01:20:16,550 --> 01:20:19,468
Interrogation slips.

577
01:20:56,298 --> 01:20:58,872
Get up here!

578
01:21:06,057 --> 01:21:08,179
Close that.

579
01:21:10,228 --> 01:21:14,291
I had to go to the toilet, I was no
longer than five minutes.

580
01:21:14,333 --> 01:21:16,744
Give me your Interrogation slips.

581
01:21:26,371 --> 01:21:28,337
Why so many?


582
01:21:29,227 --> 01:21:33,747
They are from, since Friday
whole through the holiday week.

583
01:21:34,835 --> 01:21:39,497
How long have you been here?
36 hours.

584
01:21:41,467 --> 01:21:46,971
You have no relief?
No sir, my partner got sick ...

585
01:21:47,181 --> 01:21:52,768
and didn't send anyone else from the station.
Because of the holiday.

586
01:21:54,104 --> 01:21:57,142
Let us look through the 
Interrogation slips, well...


587
01:22:01,029 --> 01:22:02,942
no harm done.

588
01:22:03,460 --> 01:22:07,464
You can send these along with
the rest of the interrogation slips . 
When you're relieved..

589
01:22:15,333 --> 01:22:17,134
What is it?

590
01:22:18,836 --> 01:22:23,796
Did you personally speak to this man?
- Yes, Sir.

591
01:22:24,969 --> 01:22:26,398
Why?


592
01:22:26,440 --> 01:22:31,236
He came out of the woods and
there was dirt on his jacket.

593
01:22:31,726 --> 01:22:36,633
He was well dressed, but he was dirty.
So I asked him his business.


594
01:22:36,936 --> 01:22:43,104
He said he visited his mother in Belkovsky, 
which is a tiny hamlet near here.

595
01:22:43,359 --> 01:22:49,871
Which made sense, except I...
I was born in Belkovsky and 
I didn't remember her. So, I wrote him up.

596
01:22:51,367 --> 01:22:57,240
Did you search him?
- No, Sir. He hadn't accosted anyone ...

597
01:22:57,499 --> 01:23:03,538
He only just looked odd.
You Remember this man? Chikatilo.

598
01:23:08,466 --> 01:23:13,175
Did he had a bag?
- Yes

599
01:23:18,644 --> 01:23:21,260
Consider yourselves relieved of this post.

600
01:23:21,302 --> 01:23:25,000
Take my car to the station immediately,
Tell him, to contact Moscow  ...

601
01:23:25,042 --> 01:23:28,985
I wanted 200 soldiers here
to prepare to search these woods in one hour!

602
01:23:28,986 --> 01:23:32,114
Got It?! In one hour!
- Yes Sir!

603
01:23:52,552 --> 01:23:58,009
My God ...
What is happening to me?

604
01:23:58,434 --> 01:24:03,475
My heart is pounding,
My throat feels tight..

605
01:24:06,067 --> 01:24:08,142
What the hell is this?

606
01:24:09,902 --> 01:24:11,811
Passion.

607
01:24:23,248 --> 01:24:26,618
General, they found something ...

608
01:24:38,557 --> 01:24:42,718
Stand Back, Comrades.
You have done your part, Thank you.

609
01:24:43,310 --> 01:24:47,037
Get the team together and start
sending these soldiers home,

610
01:24:47,079 --> 01:24:49,722
Unless the General
have some other use for them.

611
01:25:27,436 --> 01:25:30,568
I have 49 of them in my conscience.

612
01:25:32,144 --> 01:25:34,810
You mustn't blame yourself.

613
01:25:36,279 --> 01:25:40,442
It's not that.
- What then?

614
01:25:41,117 --> 01:25:46,358
She is my cousin's daughter, 
Natasja Dunenkova.

615
01:25:46,871 --> 01:25:49,077
She was 8.

616
01:25:53,753 --> 01:25:55,711
I am Sorry.

617
01:26:02,178 --> 01:26:07,932
You be okay? You wanted me to send
someone along with you?

618
01:26:11,896 --> 01:26:17,767
For what it's worth, you may 
have helped us catch him.

619
01:26:27,161 --> 01:26:31,490


620
01:27:30,807 --> 01:27:33,134
Just keep walking.


621
01:28:18,436 --> 01:28:20,277
How did you get this?

622
01:28:20,319 --> 01:28:25,195
At work, A box
fell over me at work.


623
01:28:26,651 --> 01:28:30,815
Would you mind removing 
all your clothes, please. 
- What?

624
01:28:31,615 --> 01:28:33,773
Remove your clothes.

625
01:28:51,634 --> 01:28:55,548
How did you get these  aberations
on the head of your penis?

626
01:28:59,434 --> 01:29:01,412
How did you get these  aberations
on the head of your penis?

627
01:29:02,220 --> 01:29:04,130
I don't know.

628
01:29:05,935 --> 01:29:11,149
Can you honestly tell me that you feel any remorse?
For killing children!

629
01:29:12,698 --> 01:29:22,948
For cutting off their genitals?
Don't you feel you've to confess to your crimes?
My God. Are you human.

630
01:29:25,751 --> 01:29:28,787
This is a disaster.
Why can't we ...

631
01:29:29,004 --> 01:29:34,023
Because we can't ... Because he
demanded, to do the interrogation himself.


632
01:29:34,593 --> 01:29:37,761
And he still has a lot of friends.

633
01:29:39,724 --> 01:29:43,888


634
01:29:47,816 --> 01:29:53,984
I will talk about my crimes, tomorrow.
What did you say? Repeat that.

635
01:29:54,696 --> 01:30:01,782
I'll tell about my crimes tomorrow.
But I'm exhausted today.

636
01:30:02,204 --> 01:30:04,363
Did you get that?

637
01:30:06,541 --> 01:30:10,290
Good. Now it is in the official record.

638
01:30:24,181 --> 01:30:27,301
We're not getting anywhere.

639
01:30:31,438 --> 01:30:34,306
What are you talking about? Did you hear,
what he had just said?

640
01:30:35,905 --> 01:30:38,199
He said that yesterday too.

641
01:30:38,445 --> 01:30:44,034
It is the only way he knows
to get you to stop bantering him.

642
01:30:46,121 --> 01:30:48,280
What do you want?

643
01:30:49,541 --> 01:30:54,916
I want you to let us bring in someone, 
who can get somewhere with him.

644
01:30:55,128 --> 01:30:59,791
I am doing the interrogation.
You are wasting time, five days already!

645
01:31:00,050 --> 01:31:02,929
With no other evidence, if we
do not get a confession


646
01:31:02,971 --> 01:31:05,305
by 28th we have to let him go.

647
01:31:05,514 --> 01:31:06,998
I am doing the interrogation.

648
01:31:07,040 --> 01:31:11,544
Are you willing to take that
risk, just to satisfy your ego?

649
01:31:21,990 --> 01:31:24,687
You've handled him quite deftly.

650
01:31:24,729 --> 01:31:29,892
I'm fed up! I will not suffer
that stupidity anymore.

651
01:31:30,580 --> 01:31:34,828
He may be stupid, but he's in charge.

652
01:31:39,756 --> 01:31:44,004


653
01:31:44,846 --> 01:31:49,389
What is this?
This is your confession?

654
01:31:49,684 --> 01:31:52,833
In 1978 you fondled the
breast of a 11 year old girl.

655
01:31:52,875 --> 01:31:55,035
You mocking me?

656
01:31:55,565 --> 01:31:56,855
It's true.

657
01:31:56,898 --> 01:31:58,661
I don't give it a damn, if it's true!

658
01:31:58,702 --> 01:32:02,318
We are talking about murder here. You know that!

659
01:32:02,360 --> 01:32:04,036
You think I'm a fool?

660
01:32:04,078 --> 01:32:07,672
I was fired from my teaching
job for that incident..

661
01:32:07,698 --> 01:32:09,739
I know that!

662
01:32:12,414 --> 01:32:16,412
What the hell kind of game are you playing?

663
01:32:19,087 --> 01:32:22,788
Citizen Chikatilo, I asked you a question!

664
01:32:32,307 --> 01:32:36,685
Tomorrow is our last day, we would have to...
You think I don't know that?

665
01:32:38,313 --> 01:32:41,178
If you want the man who  
gets him to confess

666
01:32:41,221 --> 01:32:45,206
won't that reflect happily on your wisdom.

667
01:32:49,326 --> 01:32:51,995
Whom do you have in mind, Colonel?

668
01:32:53,205 --> 01:32:57,950



669
01:33:30,323 --> 01:33:35,446
I've never done this before.
I'm terrified.


670
01:33:36,744 --> 01:33:41,157
I Bukhanovsky.
I am a Psychiatrist. And I ...

671
01:33:42,208 --> 01:33:46,247
I wrote a paper
about you three years ago.

672
01:33:47,507 --> 01:33:50,078
I called you Citizen X

673
01:33:52,427 --> 01:33:55,962
I'm sure lot of things 
are widely incorrect.

674
01:33:56,859 --> 01:33:58,863
Would you like it, to read it to you?

675
01:34:05,064 --> 01:34:06,938
Pardon me?

676
01:34:08,692 --> 01:34:11,480
Yes, Please.

677
01:34:14,782 --> 01:34:20,025
Let's leave aside those things which are larely 
rubbish, designed to make me sound brighter.

678
01:34:20,162 --> 01:34:22,915
We shall ignore that which is not important .

679
01:34:29,881 --> 01:34:36,000
Citizen "X" has probably had a tendencey 
towards isolation since childhood.

680
01:34:36,219 --> 01:34:41,593
His internal world filled with fantasy
is closed to those around him ...

681
01:34:41,892 --> 01:34:43,763
even to those close to him.

682
01:34:43,804 --> 01:34:47,812
The adolescence of such a person is
as a rule painful ...

683
01:34:47,981 --> 01:34:51,866
because he is often subjected
to the laughter of his peers ...

684
01:34:51,908 --> 01:34:58,342
and at a time when success among
them is the subject of his secret dreams.

685
01:35:05,039 --> 01:35:09,832
His sexuality is not noticeable
to those around him.

686
01:35:09,902 --> 01:35:12,826
However it is an external asexuality

687
01:35:12,868 --> 01:35:18,135
that which frequently coincides with steady
masturbation and abundant erotic fantasies.

688
01:35:18,910 --> 01:35:21,843
He is painfully sensitive in company.


689
01:35:22,182 --> 01:35:27,010
incapable of flirting and courting.
However it cannot be excluded ...

690
01:35:27,271 --> 01:35:30,058
that he has fathered a family.

691
01:35:31,066 --> 01:35:33,984


692
01:35:34,278 --> 01:35:40,485
There is a reason to think that the Citizen
"X" has weakness in sexual potency.

693
01:35:41,522 --> 01:35:45,655
This is supported by the fact that the 
signs of the entry of the sexual organ 

694
01:35:45,697 --> 01:35:48,321
into the sexual part of  the
victims has been found in ...

695
01:35:48,389 --> 01:35:55,785
nine cases, but at only two  the length
of contact has been sufficient to reach orgasm.

696
01:35:56,298 --> 01:36:01,719
but with the rest of the cases involving
ejaculation on the body of the victims.

697
01:36:05,807 --> 01:36:07,264



698
01:36:04,724 --> 01:36:12,247
He sits or squats astride his victims, 
the orgasm and ejaculation most likely...


699
01:36:12,289 --> 01:36:16,845
occur at this stage of
the act and in this position ...

700
01:36:16,886 --> 01:36:21,373
sitting on the victim
in the period of her agony.

701
01:36:28,162 --> 01:36:34,135
The blinding of some of the victims could
be a symbol of his power over his victims ...

702
01:36:35,294 --> 01:36:41,033
or an inability to bear his or her gaze,
even if it is unconscious.

703
01:36:41,075 --> 01:36:45,852
Or possibly a reflection of 
"X" 's belief in the folk tales

704
01:36:45,894 --> 01:36:48,474
that the victims eyes ...

705
01:36:48,516 --> 01:36:53,266
retain an image of the killer,
even after his death.

706
01:37:14,874 --> 01:37:18,124
Was I right, Is it not.

707
01:37:18,920 --> 01:37:22,497
He believed that the police might
see your image in their eyes?

708
01:37:30,474 --> 01:37:33,687
What about the ejaculation, was I right about that?

709
01:37:33,728 --> 01:37:37,532
Sitting on the victim
on the period of her agony?

710
01:37:49,909 --> 01:37:53,907
You Ejaculated while stabbing them?

711
01:38:03,173 --> 01:38:08,416
I Ejaculated while stabbing them.

712
01:38:10,221 --> 01:38:16,636
Sometimes before they died,
some times after ...

713
01:38:21,104 --> 01:38:24,723
With or without additional masturbation?

714
01:38:27,652 --> 01:38:29,977
Most times, yes.

715
01:38:31,573 --> 01:38:37,693
That justifies the scars on your organs?
The frenzied masturbation.

716
01:38:39,999 --> 01:38:43,007
With the last one especially ...

717
01:38:45,195 --> 01:38:47,607
Natasja Dunenkova.

718
01:38:51,091 --> 01:38:55,819
After killing her I still had some ...

719
01:38:57,379 --> 01:38:59,490
difficulty.

720
01:39:01,686 --> 01:39:08,057
I hurt myself trying to 
achieve orgasm.

721
01:39:42,102 --> 01:39:45,138
Congratulations, gentlemen.

722
01:40:02,913 --> 01:40:07,397
The General would say something witty,
but he's overcome with emotion right now.

723
01:40:08,294 --> 01:40:09,847
Thank you both.

724
01:40:11,229 --> 01:40:15,385
May I say that together,
you make a wonderful person.

725
01:40:23,766 --> 01:40:28,475
Release the Monster!
We will give him Justice!

726
01:40:46,122 --> 01:40:48,871
Step aside. Step aside, dammit!

727
01:40:52,876 --> 01:40:57,870
You should thank them for God's sake!
These are the men who caught him!

728
01:42:00,234 --> 01:42:05,311


729
01:42:05,615 --> 01:42:12,662


730
01:42:15,209 --> 01:42:18,874


731
01:42:19,088 --> 01:42:23,131


732
01:42:23,381 --> 01:42:28,293



733
01:42:33,601 --> 01:42:39,306


734
01:42:58,208 --> 01:43:04,043


735
01:43:04,338 --> 01:43:07,743



736
01:43:10,846 --> 01:43:16,089


737
01:43:22,650 --> 01:43:30,226


738
01:43:50,967 --> 01:44:03,303


739
01:44:23,041 --> 01:44:26,788
Step through the door, please.

740
01:44:41,850 --> 01:44:46,062
Please don't turn around ...

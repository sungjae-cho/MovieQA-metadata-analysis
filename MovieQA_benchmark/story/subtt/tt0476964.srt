1
00:00:58,849 --> 00:01:03,475
<i>I'm Erica Bain. And as you know,
I walk the city.</i>

2
00:01:04,313 --> 00:01:08,975
<i>I bitch and moan about it.
I walk and watch and listen...</i>

3
00:01:09,151 --> 00:01:11,986
<i>... a witness to all
the beauty and ugliness...</i>

4
00:01:12,154 --> 00:01:15,238
<i>... that is disappearing
from our beloved city.</i>

5
00:01:15,407 --> 00:01:18,028
<i>Last week took me to
the gray depths of the East River...</i>

6
00:01:18,201 --> 00:01:21,368
<i>... where Dimitri Panchenko
swims his morning laps...</i>

7
00:01:21,538 --> 00:01:24,539
<i>... like he has every morning
since the 1960s.</i>

8
00:01:26,334 --> 00:01:31,709
<i>Today I walked by the scaffolding
outside what used to be the Plaza Hotel...</i>

9
00:01:31,882 --> 00:01:34,551
<i>... and I thought about Eloise.</i>

10
00:01:34,759 --> 00:01:37,547
<i>Remember Kay Thompson 's Eloise?</i>

11
00:01:37,721 --> 00:01:40,638
<i>Eloise who lived in the Plaza Hotel...</i>

12
00:01:40,807 --> 00:01:44,935
<i>... with her dog Weenie and her parents,
who were always away...</i>

13
00:01:45,103 --> 00:01:49,599
<i>... and her English nanny who had
eight hairpins made out of bones.</i>

14
00:01:49,774 --> 00:01:55,279
<i>That Eloise. The adored brat
of my childhood. A little punk kid...</i>

15
00:01:55,447 --> 00:02:00,322
<i>Sid Vicious, spewing beer from his teeth
in the Chelsea Hotel.</i>

16
00:02:00,493 --> 00:02:02,901
<i>Andy Warhol, his sunglasses...</i>

17
00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:04,194
<i>Edgar Allan Poe...</i>

18
00:02:04,372 --> 00:02:07,955
<i>... freeing live monkeys from
the crates of a crumbling schooner...</i>

19
00:02:08,126 --> 00:02:11,411
<i>... on the oily slips of South Street.</i>

20
00:02:11,588 --> 00:02:13,710
<i>Stories of a city...</i>

21
00:02:13,881 --> 00:02:18,425
<i>... that is disappearing before our eyes.
Its people swept over...</i>

22
00:02:18,594 --> 00:02:21,050
<i>So, what will be left of those stories?</i>

23
00:02:21,222 --> 00:02:26,382
<i>Are we going to have to construct an
imaginary city to house our memories?</i>

24
00:02:26,644 --> 00:02:30,938
<i>Because when you love something,
every time a bit of it goes...</i>

25
00:02:31,107 --> 00:02:34,191
<i>... you lose a piece of yourself.</i>

26
00:02:34,694 --> 00:02:38,738
<i>So where's Eloise going to sleep tonight?
Can you hear her ghost...</i>

27
00:02:38,906 --> 00:02:43,070
<i>... wandering around the collapsing
corridors of her beloved Plaza...</i>

28
00:02:43,244 --> 00:02:45,486
<i>... trying to find her nanny's room...</i>

29
00:02:45,663 --> 00:02:48,580
<i>... calling out
to the construction workers...</i>

30
00:02:48,749 --> 00:02:51,501
<i>...in a voice that nobody hears:</i>

31
00:02:51,669 --> 00:02:55,667
"Has anyone seen my turtle,
Skipperdee?"

32
00:02:55,881 --> 00:03:00,590
<i>This is Erica Bain, and you've been
listening to Street Walk on WNKW.</i>

33
00:03:00,761 --> 00:03:03,845
<i>- And this is 90. 1, WNKW.
- All right.</i>

34
00:03:04,849 --> 00:03:07,600
- See you next week.
- Have a good one, Erica.

35
00:03:11,272 --> 00:03:12,896
Hey, I'm out of here.

36
00:03:13,065 --> 00:03:15,354
Did Eloise really mean that much to you?

37
00:03:15,526 --> 00:03:18,443
Oh, come on, Carol.
Weren't you ever a little girl?

38
00:03:18,612 --> 00:03:21,732
Not the kind of little girl that
remembers the name of her turtle.

39
00:03:21,907 --> 00:03:23,734
Anyway, good show.

40
00:03:23,909 --> 00:03:27,029
Look, Bravo called again
about that TV spot.

41
00:03:27,204 --> 00:03:28,995
You know what? I'm...

42
00:03:29,164 --> 00:03:31,489
I'm not a face. I'm just a voice.

43
00:03:31,667 --> 00:03:34,668
The shows are on the website.
People can download them for free.

44
00:03:34,837 --> 00:03:37,078
- Yeah, exactly.
- Maybe.

45
00:03:38,382 --> 00:03:40,042
Bye.

46
00:03:41,051 --> 00:03:43,209
<i>- Hello?
- Hey.</i>

47
00:03:43,387 --> 00:03:45,463
<i>- Hello.
- What are you wearing?</i>

48
00:03:45,639 --> 00:03:48,842
Green scrubs, tied at the waist,
very sexy V-neck.

49
00:03:49,685 --> 00:03:52,472
<i>- Short-sleeved little number.
- How about the sexy green hat?</i>

50
00:03:52,646 --> 00:03:53,974
<i>- Still got that?
- In my hand.</i>

51
00:03:54,147 --> 00:03:57,232
You like it more than the others,
less than the others or the same?

52
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,729
Oh, yeah. I'm at the place...

53
00:03:58,902 --> 00:04:02,401
...and I wanna make sure you're still
okay with the cream and the orange.

54
00:04:02,572 --> 00:04:03,817
Yeah, cream and orange.

55
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:06,564
Actually, it's not cream.
It's vanilla. But that's fine.

56
00:04:06,743 --> 00:04:08,321
It's not cream. It's vanilla.

57
00:04:08,495 --> 00:04:11,911
<i>- Who cares? Let's go get married tonight.
- Your mother cares.</i>

58
00:04:12,082 --> 00:04:14,323
Trust me, she wants invitations.

59
00:04:14,501 --> 00:04:16,458
Yeah, these are good. Thanks.

60
00:04:16,628 --> 00:04:19,997
Hey, listen. For tonight, if you meet me
at Nicole's art thing...

61
00:04:20,173 --> 00:04:22,130
<i>... you don 't have to
talk to anyone but me.</i>

62
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:23,878
<i>- Maybe.
- Come on.</i>

63
00:04:24,052 --> 00:04:27,172
<i>- I've got a game, haven 't I?
- You're not coming?</i>

64
00:04:27,347 --> 00:04:29,386
<i>- Look, I've gotta go.
- What?</i>

65
00:04:29,557 --> 00:04:31,051
<i>I do love you.</i>

66
00:04:31,226 --> 00:04:33,633
Yeah. I love you too.

67
00:04:34,854 --> 00:04:36,894
- Hi.
- Hi. Oh, you're James.

68
00:04:37,357 --> 00:04:39,100
- I'm Erica. I'm Nicole's friend.
- Hi.

69
00:04:39,275 --> 00:04:42,027
These are good.
They're really cool. I love them.

70
00:04:42,195 --> 00:04:45,979
The Laundromat is in a town in Jersey
where Diane Arbus did her laundry.

71
00:04:46,157 --> 00:04:49,277
- Oh, yeah?
- That gun store is down in Chinatown.

72
00:04:50,078 --> 00:04:52,699
Berenice Abbott shot it in the '30s.

73
00:04:52,872 --> 00:04:55,908
It's really evocative, you know?

74
00:04:56,083 --> 00:04:59,535
Kind of quiet. I like that.
It doesn't make too much noise.

75
00:04:59,712 --> 00:05:00,743
Thanks.

76
00:05:00,922 --> 00:05:03,128
Bring more drinks, less shrimp. More.

77
00:05:03,299 --> 00:05:04,877
Where you going? You're leaving?

78
00:05:05,051 --> 00:05:08,384
- No, no. I'm staying. I'm staying.
- Oh, my God, you're such a bad liar.

79
00:05:08,554 --> 00:05:09,669
I know, but I try.

80
00:05:09,847 --> 00:05:12,385
You have to convince him
to come to one of these things.

81
00:05:12,558 --> 00:05:14,930
He can't avoid us forever. Oh, my God.

82
00:05:15,102 --> 00:05:17,558
- What are you doing here?
- Don't you love this woman?

83
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:20,684
I could take her or leave her.
You guys...

84
00:05:20,858 --> 00:05:22,934
...this, when it starts, it's disgusting.

85
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:24,604
- We have to go.
- You're too happy.

86
00:05:24,778 --> 00:05:25,810
- Say goodbye.
- Bye.

87
00:05:25,988 --> 00:05:27,067
- I hate you.
- I love you.

88
00:05:27,239 --> 00:05:28,899
I really... I hate you so much.

89
00:05:34,455 --> 00:05:37,076
Oh, God. It's so pretty out.

90
00:05:37,708 --> 00:05:39,950
Tell you what. I'll get him.
You sit here. Okay?

91
00:05:40,127 --> 00:05:42,203
No, let me get him.

92
00:05:42,379 --> 00:05:44,870
- Okay. Will you get me my jacket too?
- Fine.

93
00:05:45,049 --> 00:05:47,456
Here. Take this.

94
00:05:47,634 --> 00:05:49,177
Thanks.

95
00:05:56,643 --> 00:05:57,972
Hey.

96
00:05:58,145 --> 00:06:00,896
Oh, I can open my own door.

97
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:03,482
Thank you.

98
00:06:14,745 --> 00:06:17,070
Good boy. Good boy.

99
00:06:18,457 --> 00:06:20,782
- Hi, puppy!
- Here.

100
00:06:22,794 --> 00:06:25,581
Are you gonna be that crabby
when you get older?

101
00:06:25,755 --> 00:06:28,460
I am older. And I'm way meaner.

102
00:06:28,633 --> 00:06:31,800
Look, she gave me an apple. Here, baby.

103
00:06:34,806 --> 00:06:38,222
- So she is human.
- That was too big a bite.

104
00:06:38,643 --> 00:06:43,186
That was too big a bite. I didn't
say you could eat the whole thing.

105
00:06:43,356 --> 00:06:44,731
You know what?

106
00:06:44,899 --> 00:06:47,225
I could get about maybe five days...

107
00:06:47,402 --> 00:06:50,438
...and we could go to
the place with the water and...

108
00:06:50,613 --> 00:06:54,196
...find good food and lots of sleeping.

109
00:06:54,367 --> 00:06:56,241
Yes, I concur.

110
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:58,949
Here, boy. Good boy.

111
00:07:01,708 --> 00:07:03,416
Good boy.

112
00:07:06,587 --> 00:07:08,913
Don't give it to him. Throw it.

113
00:07:14,637 --> 00:07:18,220
- I wasn't mucking about, you know.
- What about?

114
00:07:18,391 --> 00:07:20,964
Why can't we go down
to city hall tonight?

115
00:07:21,352 --> 00:07:24,353
- Because it's closed.
- Tomorrow, then.

116
00:07:25,815 --> 00:07:27,938
David, you have a family.
I don't, you know?

117
00:07:28,109 --> 00:07:32,237
- You're not marrying my family.
- Well, I am, kind of.

118
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:35,401
I mean, I hope I am.

119
00:07:37,993 --> 00:07:42,157
Your mom is so sweet and she just...
She wants the whole deal, you know?

120
00:07:42,331 --> 00:07:45,000
She wants the invitations...

121
00:07:45,167 --> 00:07:49,746
...and the band playing and the minister.

122
00:07:50,798 --> 00:07:54,083
I don't know. Maybe I do too,
you know? Because...

123
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:57,214
...it's not like I'm gonna do this twice.

124
00:07:58,472 --> 00:08:00,097
You're not?

125
00:08:01,517 --> 00:08:03,723
No, I'm not.

126
00:08:05,521 --> 00:08:08,391
That's the nicest thing
you ever said to me.

127
00:08:26,375 --> 00:08:27,952
Where's Curtis?

128
00:08:28,293 --> 00:08:30,001
Oi, Curtis!

129
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:31,712
Come on, boy.

130
00:08:32,506 --> 00:08:34,878
Come on, pup! Did he go up there?

131
00:08:36,301 --> 00:08:38,341
- He's not in there, is he?
- Come on!

132
00:08:38,804 --> 00:08:40,512
Curtis?

133
00:08:42,766 --> 00:08:43,797
Hey!

134
00:08:44,893 --> 00:08:46,173
- There he is.
- Curtis.

135
00:08:51,858 --> 00:08:53,400
- Come on, boy.
- Curtis, come on.

136
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:58,025
Hey, Curtis?

137
00:08:58,615 --> 00:09:01,402
- Hey.
- Curtis.

138
00:09:05,121 --> 00:09:06,580
Hey.

139
00:09:08,291 --> 00:09:11,458
- What's up, boy?
- What's wrong, sweetheart?

140
00:09:11,628 --> 00:09:12,956
Hey.

141
00:09:13,129 --> 00:09:15,537
Man, don't you know
there's a fucking leash law?

142
00:09:15,715 --> 00:09:17,957
Yeah, don't you fucking know better?

143
00:09:18,843 --> 00:09:21,215
Yeah. I'm sorry. Thanks for finding him.

144
00:09:21,763 --> 00:09:24,384
It's... It's all good, bro. It's all good.

145
00:09:25,767 --> 00:09:26,798
But...

146
00:09:27,393 --> 00:09:29,600
...I get a reward or something?

147
00:09:34,317 --> 00:09:36,226
Our gratitude. Now give him to me.

148
00:09:36,402 --> 00:09:39,356
Come on, man. You know gratitude
ain't worth shit around here.

149
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:41,439
- You're hurting him!
- Give me the dog.

150
00:09:41,949 --> 00:09:45,817
No, I don't think so.
See, I kind of like this dog.

151
00:09:45,995 --> 00:09:48,533
I think he's a keeper. A keeper.

152
00:09:49,081 --> 00:09:50,741
Smile, baby.

153
00:09:58,090 --> 00:10:00,379
- You are a cunt.
- Fuck you, bitch!

154
00:10:00,551 --> 00:10:04,715
Come on, motherfucker.
That's what I thought, you stupid pussy.

155
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:07,431
- Look...
- Go.

156
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,091
I haven't got much money.
You can have what I've got.

157
00:10:10,269 --> 00:10:13,472
Give me your watch, give me your
ring. Let's go, I ain't got all day.

158
00:10:13,647 --> 00:10:15,189
Hurry the fuck up, princess.

159
00:10:15,816 --> 00:10:17,975
- Let's go. Hurry up!
- Give him the shit.

160
00:10:18,152 --> 00:10:19,860
- Get the fuck over here.
- Fuck!

161
00:10:21,739 --> 00:10:24,656
- David!
- I fucking missed it!

162
00:10:24,867 --> 00:10:26,065
Where you going?

163
00:10:26,243 --> 00:10:28,651
- Action!
- Think you're fucking with me?!

164
00:10:29,621 --> 00:10:31,032
You just made my day!

165
00:10:33,292 --> 00:10:34,869
Popped your motherfucking cherry!

166
00:10:36,378 --> 00:10:38,086
Let's even shit out.

167
00:10:38,922 --> 00:10:40,962
Ready for your close-up, cunt?!

168
00:10:41,133 --> 00:10:42,378
Heads up!

169
00:10:42,718 --> 00:10:43,749
Hollywood!

170
00:10:43,927 --> 00:10:45,967
Think you're fucking with me?!

171
00:10:49,057 --> 00:10:51,548
You ain't got nothing to say now, fool!

172
00:10:52,436 --> 00:10:56,433
- David.
- Oh, how cute. Lovebirds.

173
00:10:56,606 --> 00:10:59,810
- A chickenhead and a faggot.
- Say "cheese," bitch!

174
00:12:05,925 --> 00:12:07,467
This is the emergency room.

175
00:12:07,635 --> 00:12:10,422
- Did you get any sleep?
- No. Where's Murrow?

176
00:12:10,596 --> 00:12:12,340
We're looking for him.

177
00:12:12,515 --> 00:12:15,848
She was dead on arrival
and her fingerprints are all over the gun.

178
00:12:16,143 --> 00:12:18,053
- Where?
- Bedroom.

179
00:12:18,229 --> 00:12:20,056
Daughter called 911.

180
00:12:20,231 --> 00:12:23,066
Thanks. I wanna see her.

181
00:12:31,117 --> 00:12:34,568
- So he's laughing again.
- Yeah.

182
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:42,994
Listen, the kid's in a waiting room
with ACS. I'll meet you over there.

183
00:12:50,052 --> 00:12:52,377
We need your signature right here.

184
00:12:55,432 --> 00:12:57,092
Where is she?

185
00:13:03,524 --> 00:13:07,023
- Can I talk to her?
- You can try.

186
00:13:09,238 --> 00:13:11,111
Hey, sweetie.

187
00:13:11,281 --> 00:13:13,523
Can I have a word with you?

188
00:13:15,702 --> 00:13:19,451
We're just gonna be right here.
All right.

189
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:22,705
You like lollipops?

190
00:13:32,969 --> 00:13:34,380
Pick one.

191
00:13:37,265 --> 00:13:39,803
That was the one I was gonna pick.

192
00:13:44,481 --> 00:13:46,390
You know, sweetie...

193
00:13:47,651 --> 00:13:50,142
...something you should know.
Your mommy...

194
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,941
...she was really worried about you.

195
00:13:53,865 --> 00:13:59,025
And if she could, she would tell you
that you can trust me.

196
00:14:05,418 --> 00:14:07,541
Did your stepfather hurt your mommy?

197
00:14:08,296 --> 00:14:09,790
Sean? Sean!

198
00:14:09,964 --> 00:14:11,458
Okay. Okay, step back!

199
00:14:11,633 --> 00:14:13,590
- I want my daughter!
- Get back!

200
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,333
All right! All right.

201
00:14:21,809 --> 00:14:23,351
You don't have the right.

202
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:26,010
- I do...
- At a time like this, I need to see her.

203
00:14:26,189 --> 00:14:28,265
No, you don't. I do have the right.

204
00:14:28,441 --> 00:14:31,014
- She is my daughter.
- No, she is your stepdaughter.

205
00:14:31,194 --> 00:14:33,186
And you know
how this whole thing works.

206
00:14:33,362 --> 00:14:36,566
You done been through this a thousand
times. You hire your lawyers...

207
00:14:36,741 --> 00:14:39,658
...and you do your thing.
But right now, we're gonna do ours.

208
00:14:42,663 --> 00:14:45,913
- I'm taking a walk. You deal with him.
- Yeah, I got it.

209
00:14:48,878 --> 00:14:52,377
That was Dr. Sterling. Okay, bye-bye.

210
00:15:12,901 --> 00:15:14,941
It's a hell of a thing.

211
00:15:15,487 --> 00:15:18,773
- Yup.
- I heard her show once.

212
00:16:01,491 --> 00:16:03,199
Erica?

213
00:16:05,287 --> 00:16:07,778
Erica, can you hear me?

214
00:16:08,957 --> 00:16:10,784
Erica?

215
00:16:11,292 --> 00:16:13,451
You had the service?

216
00:16:14,045 --> 00:16:16,667
They didn't know when
you were going to wake up...

217
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:19,461
...if you were going to wake up.

218
00:16:20,009 --> 00:16:22,631
You were gone for three weeks.

219
00:16:22,804 --> 00:16:26,303
We had to let him go. We had to.

220
00:16:26,558 --> 00:16:28,266
I wanna see him again.

221
00:16:28,434 --> 00:16:30,094
- He's gone.
- I wanna see him again!

222
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:32,595
He's gone, honey.

223
00:16:36,651 --> 00:16:39,735
He would have been happy
that you lived.

224
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:56,582
<i>Nurse Bench, you have a call
on one-four. Nurse Bench.</i>

225
00:16:59,465 --> 00:17:04,460
I don't know. All the faces
are starting to blur together. L...

226
00:17:04,637 --> 00:17:06,428
I just can't tell anymore, you know?

227
00:17:06,597 --> 00:17:10,298
You gotta help us here. We need
something from you, anything.

228
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:13,136
Let's start over again.

229
00:17:13,312 --> 00:17:18,307
He hit your boyfriend with the pipe.
Once, twice, three times?

230
00:17:19,652 --> 00:17:21,062
We know how tough it can be...

231
00:17:21,237 --> 00:17:24,072
...to go back there...
- Do you, huh?

232
00:17:25,908 --> 00:17:29,443
Look, Miss Bain, we're on your side.

233
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:33,408
Yeah.

234
00:17:33,707 --> 00:17:35,534
I know that.

235
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:37,740
You're the good guys.

236
00:17:39,838 --> 00:17:41,914
So how come it doesn't feel like that?

237
00:22:04,809 --> 00:22:08,723
<i>Please leave a message
for David and Erica after the beep.</i>

238
00:22:09,438 --> 00:22:12,724
<i>Hey, it's me. Call me at the gallery.</i>

239
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:16,351
<i>I'll take you out. Go to dinner, a movie.</i>

240
00:22:16,862 --> 00:22:19,697
<i>Let's go for a walk. Anything, okay?</i>

241
00:24:16,897 --> 00:24:19,353
Ma'am, can I help you?

242
00:24:20,651 --> 00:24:22,940
Detective O'Connor
and Detective Pitney, please.

243
00:24:23,112 --> 00:24:27,026
Pitney and O'Connor are out.
Can anyone else help you?

244
00:24:27,533 --> 00:24:29,324
Well...

245
00:24:29,493 --> 00:24:31,818
...you know,
I wanted to check on my case.

246
00:24:31,996 --> 00:24:34,617
I've been calling and
we've been playing phone tag...

247
00:24:34,790 --> 00:24:37,032
...and I thought that if I came down...
- Okay.

248
00:24:37,209 --> 00:24:39,249
What kind of case did you have?

249
00:24:42,214 --> 00:24:44,290
My boyfriend was beaten to death.

250
00:24:44,466 --> 00:24:48,713
Oh, I'm sorry.
Do you have a complaint report number?

251
00:24:49,179 --> 00:24:51,884
- No, I don't know it.
- And what was his name?

252
00:24:52,808 --> 00:24:54,884
David Kirmani.

253
00:24:55,727 --> 00:24:58,515
K-l-R-M-A-N-I.

254
00:24:59,857 --> 00:25:01,896
It might be under Erica Bain.

255
00:25:05,696 --> 00:25:07,854
About how long ago did it happen?

256
00:25:08,031 --> 00:25:09,525
June 11th.

257
00:25:11,952 --> 00:25:14,028
Okay. I realize how difficult
this can be...

258
00:25:14,204 --> 00:25:17,075
...but if you'd please be patient
and have a seat over there...

259
00:25:17,249 --> 00:25:19,704
...an officer will be down shortly
to help you.

260
00:25:19,876 --> 00:25:21,418
Okay.

261
00:25:44,067 --> 00:25:45,775
I realize how difficult it can be...

262
00:25:45,944 --> 00:25:48,814
...but if you'd please be patient
and have a seat over there...

263
00:25:48,988 --> 00:25:51,942
...an officer will be down shortly
to help you.

264
00:26:18,851 --> 00:26:20,974
- Wanna get something to eat?
- What's up, guys?

265
00:26:21,145 --> 00:26:22,805
- Hey.
- You saw the game last night?

266
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:24,605
Man.

267
00:26:36,494 --> 00:26:37,988
Can I help you?

268
00:26:41,457 --> 00:26:43,533
Yeah. I wanna buy a gun.

269
00:26:43,709 --> 00:26:45,203
License?

270
00:26:45,461 --> 00:26:48,497
Oh, yeah, of course.
I need a license, yeah.

271
00:26:48,672 --> 00:26:53,133
Once you get one, fill out this form,
and we'll notify you in 30 days.

272
00:26:53,302 --> 00:26:54,962
I need to get something now.

273
00:26:55,137 --> 00:26:57,011
Sorry. That's illegal.

274
00:26:59,099 --> 00:27:00,475
Hey!

275
00:27:01,518 --> 00:27:03,807
I won't survive 30 days.

276
00:27:13,530 --> 00:27:15,072
Hey.

277
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:18,325
- What happened to you?
- Me? Nothing.

278
00:27:18,494 --> 00:27:20,367
A thousand dollars.

279
00:27:21,330 --> 00:27:23,038
A thousand dollars?

280
00:27:23,207 --> 00:27:25,495
Okay, but I need to learn how to use it.

281
00:27:25,667 --> 00:27:28,668
No shit. Follow me.

282
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:54,068
Wait right here.

283
00:27:57,908 --> 00:27:59,485
In here.

284
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:05,536
It's a Kahr K9.
Check to see if it's loaded.

285
00:28:05,707 --> 00:28:06,905
How do I do that?

286
00:28:07,083 --> 00:28:10,084
The chamber. Pull the slide back.

287
00:28:10,253 --> 00:28:15,045
It's got internal safety so you don't
shoot yourself. Loads from the handle.

288
00:28:15,592 --> 00:28:17,216
All right.

289
00:28:20,555 --> 00:28:22,797
You pay me now, it's yours.

290
00:28:26,895 --> 00:28:29,017
I'll throw in the bullets.

291
00:28:34,485 --> 00:28:35,766
Yeah, I'll take it.

292
00:29:02,013 --> 00:29:03,804
Got it, got it, got it.

293
00:29:29,415 --> 00:29:33,459
You shouldn't smoke. It'll kill you.

294
00:29:34,086 --> 00:29:35,877
I don't care.

295
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:39,502
There's plenty of ways to die.

296
00:29:41,593 --> 00:29:44,678
But you have to figure out a way to live.

297
00:29:44,847 --> 00:29:48,595
Now, that's hard.

298
00:30:06,827 --> 00:30:09,614
Look at you, all sophisticated.

299
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:15,121
- You shouldn't be working this late.
- I had a client dinner.

300
00:30:16,545 --> 00:30:18,703
Hey, can I get a dirty martini
for the lady?

301
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:21,205
You said this was business, Sean.

302
00:30:21,967 --> 00:30:23,544
It is.

303
00:30:25,387 --> 00:30:27,344
Eighty-six that.

304
00:30:29,391 --> 00:30:32,060
Okay, l... I need a favor from you.

305
00:30:33,603 --> 00:30:35,145
You...

306
00:30:36,272 --> 00:30:40,021
- You heard about that Murrow thing?
- His wife killed herself.

307
00:30:40,401 --> 00:30:43,319
Oh, come on. Women don't
shoot themselves in the face.

308
00:30:43,822 --> 00:30:46,147
At least in my experience.

309
00:30:46,324 --> 00:30:51,069
Where do they shoot themselves,
in your experience?

310
00:30:53,915 --> 00:30:55,113
The heart.

311
00:31:02,423 --> 00:31:04,416
Jackie, I been...

312
00:31:04,842 --> 00:31:08,626
...chasing after this asshole
for three straight years.

313
00:31:08,805 --> 00:31:12,423
And right when his wife was ready
to turn state's evidence on him...

314
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:17,428
...instead of blowing the lid off of him,
she blows off her own head.

315
00:31:17,605 --> 00:31:19,977
- Come on.
- You don't let go, do you?

316
00:31:25,321 --> 00:31:27,148
So what can I do?

317
00:31:30,576 --> 00:31:33,992
Well, she has a daughter.
Had a daughter.

318
00:31:34,163 --> 00:31:35,622
And...

319
00:31:36,749 --> 00:31:39,038
...her daughter knows something.

320
00:31:39,210 --> 00:31:42,460
But now he's asked for custody of her
and then he's gonna get it.

321
00:31:42,630 --> 00:31:45,085
- Is he the father?
- No, no. He's her stepfather.

322
00:31:45,257 --> 00:31:47,464
- And you want her made a ward of court.
- Yes.

323
00:31:47,635 --> 00:31:49,841
She knows something
and she's not safe with him.

324
00:31:50,012 --> 00:31:54,010
Look, all I'm asking you to do
is just act on her behalf.

325
00:31:54,183 --> 00:31:55,725
Please.

326
00:31:59,146 --> 00:32:01,020
Sean, I'm your ex-wife.

327
00:32:01,523 --> 00:32:03,350
Conflict of interest.

328
00:32:04,359 --> 00:32:06,566
And besides, I don't do pro bono.

329
00:32:11,283 --> 00:32:12,943
You used to.

330
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:16,032
Yeah, well, I grew up.

331
00:32:49,779 --> 00:32:50,811
When did you get out?!

332
00:32:50,989 --> 00:32:53,480
- You won't let me see my kids?
- You can't be here! Court order!

333
00:32:53,658 --> 00:32:56,493
- I'm calling 911!
- Lf I can't see them, you won't see them!

334
00:33:01,833 --> 00:33:03,826
Try seeing them now.

335
00:33:07,964 --> 00:33:09,755
It's my money too.

336
00:34:00,516 --> 00:34:02,923
I can hear you breathing.

337
00:34:29,461 --> 00:34:30,492
No.

338
00:35:52,585 --> 00:35:54,874
<i>- Squad central.
- Notify upon arrival.</i>

339
00:35:55,046 --> 00:35:57,619
- Damn.
- We're a 10-84 at 110 and Lenox.

340
00:35:57,798 --> 00:36:00,669
<i>10-4. Eighty-five to patrol supervisor
on the scene.</i>

341
00:36:00,843 --> 00:36:04,294
- 10-4.
- Looks like the circus made it to town.

342
00:36:35,127 --> 00:36:36,242
Any IDs?

343
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:39,125
Victim's a 30-year-old
Vietnamese female. Ida Combs.

344
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:43,544
- Where's the other body?
- This way.

345
00:36:45,262 --> 00:36:49,094
Got a 39-year-old, Sandy Combs.
White male.

346
00:36:49,266 --> 00:36:53,394
Looks like a roadie for Aerosmith. Don't
think those guys have a dental plan.

347
00:36:53,562 --> 00:36:55,685
Guy had a rap sheet longer than my dick.

348
00:36:55,856 --> 00:36:58,525
So in other words, no priors.

349
00:36:59,109 --> 00:37:00,687
Easy.

350
00:37:02,696 --> 00:37:07,737
So we got us a Sandy Combs and
an Ida Combs. What does that tell us?

351
00:37:07,909 --> 00:37:10,994
They're married.
I'm way ahead of you, pal.

352
00:37:11,163 --> 00:37:14,828
- Yeah, that's one way of ending it.
- You know, what's wrong with divorce?

353
00:37:15,292 --> 00:37:17,000
Everything.

354
00:37:17,627 --> 00:37:19,786
Divorce sucks.

355
00:37:21,465 --> 00:37:22,745
Okay, so tell me.

356
00:37:22,924 --> 00:37:25,462
Well, she took three in the torso
with a.38.

357
00:37:25,635 --> 00:37:29,763
Then somebody smoked him with a 9 mm
automatic. Don't ask me who, though.

358
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:32,965
And we found these casings.

359
00:37:34,978 --> 00:37:38,643
Three casings. Looks like there's
a partial print on one, but it's smudged.

360
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:40,566
Anybody check surveillance?

361
00:37:40,734 --> 00:37:43,521
That monitor's working,
but the machine's empty.

362
00:37:54,414 --> 00:37:56,323
Machine's working.

363
00:37:56,833 --> 00:37:58,576
- But where's the tape?
- Don't know.

364
00:38:04,507 --> 00:38:06,500
And why didn't he take the money?

365
00:38:06,676 --> 00:38:09,167
They chickened out, got scared?

366
00:38:11,764 --> 00:38:16,058
We got three casings, only one hit.
How about that?

367
00:38:16,227 --> 00:38:19,513
Maybe he's farsighted, crappy shooter.
Who knows?

368
00:38:19,689 --> 00:38:22,227
Or he never fired a gun before.

369
00:38:58,394 --> 00:39:00,137
<i>It is...</i>

370
00:39:00,312 --> 00:39:02,601

<i>... living.</i>

382
00:39:44,189 --> 00:39:47,640
New York, like any metropolis...

383
00:39:49,069 --> 00:39:53,944
New York, like any metropolis,
is an organism that changes, mutates.

384
00:39:54,115 --> 00:39:58,493
Building sprout-like chromosomes
on the DNA of its streets.

385
00:40:12,842 --> 00:40:15,796
<i>New York, like any metropolis...</i>

386
00:40:15,970 --> 00:40:18,757

387
00:40:18,932 --> 00:40:23,143
<i>Building sprout-like chromosomes

388
00:40:40,495 --> 00:40:44,409
Look, I've got... I've got two shows
that are almost finished.

389
00:40:44,582 --> 00:40:48,662
They're already mixed. All they need is an
intro and an outro, which I could do live.

390
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:50,711
I've got six shows in various stages.

391
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:56,087
I've got all these stories in my files.
You know, new stuff, better stuff.

392
00:40:56,469 --> 00:40:59,838
And I know what I'm doing, and
you know that I know what I'm doing.

393
00:41:00,014 --> 00:41:03,015
Erica. You've been through so much.

394
00:41:03,184 --> 00:41:05,591
You need more time before
you put yourself out there.

395
00:41:05,770 --> 00:41:08,095
- Don't make me beg.
- I don't mean to.

396
00:41:08,272 --> 00:41:11,356
But we have a public and I'm not sure
you're ready for it yet.

397
00:41:11,525 --> 00:41:13,933
You telling me I can't work
because of what happened?

398
00:41:14,111 --> 00:41:16,436
I did not say that.

399
00:41:17,698 --> 00:41:19,358
Look...

400
00:41:20,993 --> 00:41:23,401
...I just need to keep living.

401
00:41:23,579 --> 00:41:25,951
You know, I don't wanna...

402
00:41:26,707 --> 00:41:29,032
I don't wanna disappear.

403
00:41:37,009 --> 00:41:42,513
<i>- Station WNKW,
located at 90. 1 on the FM dial.</i>

404
00:41:42,681 --> 00:41:44,839
<i>Up next is Street Walk.</i>

405
00:41:45,017 --> 00:41:48,220
Let's now join Erica Bain
in our WNKW studios.

406
00:41:48,395 --> 00:41:51,729
Okay, Erica.
Three, two, one, you're on.

407
00:41:51,898 --> 00:41:54,852
This is Erica Bain, and I walk the city.

408
00:41:56,069 --> 00:41:57,729
New York...

409
00:41:58,488 --> 00:42:02,320
...like any metropolis, is an organism...

410
00:42:18,842 --> 00:42:21,130
Okay. Is there anything we can cut to?

411
00:42:21,303 --> 00:42:23,046
<i>Music, prerecord, anything?</i>

412
00:42:23,221 --> 00:42:25,012
Give me a minute, Carol.

413
00:42:25,557 --> 00:42:27,015
New York...

414
00:42:28,435 --> 00:42:30,842
...like any metropolis...

415
00:42:32,605 --> 00:42:34,183
...is...

416
00:42:45,118 --> 00:42:47,360
Oh, shit.

417
00:42:50,790 --> 00:42:52,783
New York...

418
00:42:54,252 --> 00:42:57,253
...the safest big city in the world.

419
00:42:59,590 --> 00:43:02,260
But it is horrible...

420
00:43:02,635 --> 00:43:05,470
...to fear the place you once loved.

421
00:43:06,973 --> 00:43:10,472
And to see a street corner
you knew so well...

422
00:43:10,977 --> 00:43:13,468
...and be afraid of its shadow.

423
00:43:14,188 --> 00:43:16,477
To see familiar steps,
be unable to climb them.

424
00:43:18,901 --> 00:43:22,899
I never understood
how people lived with fear.

425
00:43:23,989 --> 00:43:26,777
Women afraid to walk home alone...

426
00:43:26,951 --> 00:43:29,157
...people afraid of...

427
00:43:29,453 --> 00:43:31,446
...white powder in their mailbox...

428
00:43:31,622 --> 00:43:35,157
...darkness and night.

429
00:43:35,835 --> 00:43:39,120
<i>People afraid of people.</i>

430
00:43:40,506 --> 00:43:44,005
I always believed that fear
belonged to other people.

431
00:43:45,177 --> 00:43:47,549
Weaker people.

432
00:43:49,848 --> 00:43:52,055
It never touched me.

433
00:43:56,939 --> 00:43:59,015
And then it did.

434
00:44:02,528 --> 00:44:05,197
And when it touches you, you know...

435
00:44:05,364 --> 00:44:08,199
...that it's been there all along...

436
00:44:08,367 --> 00:44:13,075
...waiting beneath the surfaces
of everything you loved.

437
00:44:13,538 --> 00:44:17,536
And your skin crawls...

438
00:44:18,752 --> 00:44:20,376
...and your heart sickens...

439
00:44:20,545 --> 00:44:25,373
...and you look at the person you
once were walking down that street...

440
00:44:29,012 --> 00:44:31,301
...and you wonder, will you...?

441
00:44:33,225 --> 00:44:35,763
Will you ever be her again?

442
00:45:16,017 --> 00:45:17,926
Talk to me.

443
00:45:48,424 --> 00:45:50,796
Look at this motherfucker right here.

444
00:45:51,218 --> 00:45:53,923
Hey, what sounds
you got up in there, dog?

445
00:45:55,222 --> 00:45:57,594
This motherfucker
think I'm playing, man.

446
00:45:58,476 --> 00:46:02,224
Don't nobody talk in New York no more?
I asked you a motherfucking question!

447
00:46:02,396 --> 00:46:04,934
I said, what are you listening to,
you fucking faggot?!

448
00:46:05,107 --> 00:46:06,685
- Radiohead, man.
- Radiohead?

449
00:46:06,859 --> 00:46:08,650
Leave him alone, man!

450
00:46:08,902 --> 00:46:10,610
Man, shut the fuck up!

451
00:46:10,779 --> 00:46:13,021
Little man, you ain't know
your pop sucked dick?

452
00:46:13,198 --> 00:46:16,650
He's good at it too. Now, you wanna
grow up to be like that punk ass?

453
00:46:16,827 --> 00:46:18,654
That's a nice watch.
How old are you?

454
00:46:18,829 --> 00:46:21,664
- Get your ass out of here.
- Tell your mom I said "What's up?"

455
00:46:21,832 --> 00:46:24,667
Yo, little man, holler at me,
I'll show you how to be a G.

456
00:46:24,835 --> 00:46:27,587
Hey, yo, thanks for the iPod, man.

457
00:46:28,088 --> 00:46:31,338
This shit is nice, man.
This is all me right here.

458
00:46:31,508 --> 00:46:33,916
- I'm keeping this joint.
- You kidding me, right?

459
00:46:34,094 --> 00:46:35,837
This is cool.

460
00:46:40,058 --> 00:46:41,339
Oh, shit.

461
00:46:41,518 --> 00:46:45,516
- Yo, yo, yo, I got this, I got this.
- Bitch, is you crazy?

462
00:46:50,527 --> 00:46:51,986
This is too easy, man.

463
00:46:59,035 --> 00:47:00,364
So...

464
00:47:03,290 --> 00:47:05,827
...you gonna give me
some Radiohead too?

465
00:47:13,550 --> 00:47:15,922
You ever been fucked by a knife?

466
00:48:02,765 --> 00:48:05,338
<i>I should have walked out of that train.</i>

467
00:48:05,518 --> 00:48:09,598
<i>I could've just shown them the gun,
and they wouldn't have hurt me.</i>

468
00:48:13,442 --> 00:48:16,112
<i>Why don 't my hands shake?</i>

469
00:48:16,529 --> 00:48:19,483
<i>Why doesn't somebody stop me?</i>

470
00:48:27,248 --> 00:48:29,324
I swear they like Oreos.

471
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:30,958
Homicide, this is Vitale.

472
00:48:31,126 --> 00:48:33,534
There you go,
you're doing the tricks again.

473
00:48:33,712 --> 00:48:37,295
Upside down. No, come on up. Gotta
come to the top. There you go, baby.

474
00:48:37,466 --> 00:48:39,209
Okay, thank you.

475
00:48:39,468 --> 00:48:42,089
We've got two confirmed shot
on a subway from Brooklyn.

476
00:48:42,262 --> 00:48:45,548
Church Street, lower Manattan.
Everyone's arguing whose jurisdiction.

477
00:48:45,724 --> 00:48:48,049
- That makes it ours.
- All right, fellas, let's go.

478
00:49:31,770 --> 00:49:35,388
We got two dead bodies inside
the subway car, and no eyewitnesses.

479
00:49:35,565 --> 00:49:37,688
Of course not.
Did you check with BCI?

480
00:49:37,859 --> 00:49:39,104
Yeah, I got this printout.

481
00:49:39,277 --> 00:49:40,771
- They here yet?
- Yes, sir.

482
00:49:40,945 --> 00:49:43,353
- And I'll get them to you.
- Morning, fellas.

483
00:49:46,034 --> 00:49:48,276
Christ on a cracker.

484
00:49:48,870 --> 00:49:52,618
Well, I hope this is their stop.

485
00:49:55,126 --> 00:49:58,329
Got Radiohead, U2, Dixie Chicks.

486
00:49:58,504 --> 00:50:01,339
- No Wu-Tang?
- I don't think this is his.

487
00:50:07,055 --> 00:50:08,881
Money in his pocket.

488
00:50:19,150 --> 00:50:21,901
Looks like a 9 mm automatic.

489
00:50:23,613 --> 00:50:26,020
- Like from the other night?
- Yeah.

490
00:50:27,950 --> 00:50:30,524
Check it against Brass Catchers,
see if it matches.

491
00:50:44,133 --> 00:50:45,710
Hey, you.

492
00:50:48,137 --> 00:50:51,755
- Just go inside. I came out here for
a smoke. I just wanna go back in.

493
00:50:51,932 --> 00:50:55,633
You're giving me a hard time.
You let my friends in.

494
00:51:08,198 --> 00:51:12,991
They both had cash, so neither one of
them was robbed. And they had priors.

495
00:51:13,162 --> 00:51:15,154
A shitload of them.

496
00:51:15,956 --> 00:51:18,529
The guy at Sandy's, he had priors.

497
00:51:18,709 --> 00:51:20,452
I know, but that was domestic.

498
00:51:20,627 --> 00:51:23,035
No, but he wasn't robbed.

499
00:51:24,298 --> 00:51:25,460
Or something.

500
00:51:26,341 --> 00:51:29,876
- I mean, what are we missing?
- I wish I knew.

501
00:51:30,721 --> 00:51:33,675
Now, look. You got a small guy sitting.

502
00:51:33,849 --> 00:51:36,600
These two punks come at him
with a knife and, you know...

503
00:51:36,768 --> 00:51:39,473
...he shoots the first one without
getting out of his seat.

504
00:51:39,646 --> 00:51:41,140
Right. Go on, I'm with you.

505
00:51:41,314 --> 00:51:45,229
It's like maybe Mr. Average Joe just
decided, " I'm not gonna take it anymore.

506
00:51:45,485 --> 00:51:47,691
And I'm gonna take matters
into my own hands."

507
00:51:47,862 --> 00:51:49,985
The kind of guy
you wouldn't even notice.

508
00:51:50,156 --> 00:51:52,944
Well, if that's true, he's getting better.

509
00:51:53,243 --> 00:51:55,994
Yeah. Every bullet hit home.

510
00:52:06,965 --> 00:52:08,293
- Detective!
- Hey, detective!

511
00:52:08,466 --> 00:52:12,084
- Detective!
- Any leads, detective? Please.

512
00:52:13,179 --> 00:52:16,548
- Come on, step back!
- What about the bodies, detective?

513
00:52:16,724 --> 00:52:19,262
It's a new... It's a new investigation.

514
00:52:19,435 --> 00:52:21,428
We haven't talked to anybody yet, no.

515
00:52:22,188 --> 00:52:23,848
It's a brand-new investigation.

516
00:52:24,023 --> 00:52:27,558
- Any suspects?
- No, we're not... I'm sorry, we're not...

517
00:52:28,903 --> 00:52:30,860
Any leads? How many?

518
00:52:31,030 --> 00:52:32,608
Detective!

519
00:52:33,366 --> 00:52:34,741
Hey.

520
00:52:35,118 --> 00:52:36,909
Excuse me, don't I know you?

521
00:52:37,078 --> 00:52:39,699
- No, I don't think we've met.
- Wait a minute. I know you.

522
00:52:39,872 --> 00:52:41,781
- No. You haven't. L...
- What's your name?

523
00:52:41,958 --> 00:52:44,627
My name's Erica Bain.
I do a radio show.

524
00:52:44,794 --> 00:52:48,210
I don't know if you'd be interested
in doing an interview. I'd love to...

525
00:52:48,381 --> 00:52:50,587
I'm sorry.
We're not talking to the media now.

526
00:52:50,758 --> 00:52:53,296
I'm not that kind of media.
It would be about you.

527
00:52:53,469 --> 00:52:55,094
My life's not that interesting.

528
00:52:56,389 --> 00:52:59,389
- Yeah, but the work you do is.
- No, thank you.

529
00:53:12,988 --> 00:53:14,897
<i>So...</i>

530
00:53:15,491 --> 00:53:18,326
<i>... you gonna give me
some Radiohead too?</i>

531
00:53:23,999 --> 00:53:26,751
<i>You ever been fucked by a knife?</i>

532
00:53:39,598 --> 00:53:41,425
How the hell did this get out so quick?

533
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:46,096
Who knows? Coroner hates you,
people fucking technicians. Who knows?

534
00:53:46,855 --> 00:53:48,848
"Bloodbath."

535
00:53:50,067 --> 00:53:52,355
You ever listen to NKW?

536
00:53:52,527 --> 00:53:54,105
- What is that, like hip-hop?
- No.

537
00:53:56,114 --> 00:53:58,273
Remember a couple of months ago...

538
00:53:58,450 --> 00:54:01,404
...this girl and her boyfriend,
they got jacked in Central Park?

539
00:54:01,870 --> 00:54:05,570
- No. Which ones?
- Well, anyway, she has this radio show.

540
00:54:05,749 --> 00:54:08,619
- Right.
- She shows up at the subway last night...

541
00:54:08,793 --> 00:54:11,201
...guess who she wants to interview?
- Me?

542
00:54:12,380 --> 00:54:16,248
What, you? You should totally do it.
Remember that Bernie Goetz thing?

543
00:54:16,426 --> 00:54:17,457
Hey, is Canter in?

544
00:54:17,636 --> 00:54:20,387
Reporters calling in the night.
Reporters eat that shit up.

545
00:54:20,555 --> 00:54:24,138
No, well, she's not that kind of reporter.
Yeah, well, have him call me.

546
00:54:24,309 --> 00:54:25,969
What is she?
Like a DJ or something?

547
00:54:26,144 --> 00:54:28,635
- No, she's just interesting, you know.
- Interesting?

548
00:54:28,813 --> 00:54:30,722
Have him call me at my desk.
It's Mercer.

549
00:54:30,899 --> 00:54:32,975
What's she want with you?
Give her my number.

550
00:54:33,276 --> 00:54:35,648
What's her precise street address?

551
00:54:35,820 --> 00:54:37,231
You know what I want?

552
00:54:37,405 --> 00:54:39,563
I want everyone in the market
that night...

553
00:54:39,741 --> 00:54:43,525
...everyone on the subway, outside.
Everybody, I need them all brought in.

554
00:54:43,703 --> 00:54:46,028
Somebody has to have seen this guy.

555
00:54:46,205 --> 00:54:48,613
I need you to get the registration
off of this iPod.

556
00:54:49,250 --> 00:54:51,290
- See who it belongs to.
- I'm on it.

557
00:54:56,424 --> 00:54:58,132
You've been avoiding me.

558
00:54:58,301 --> 00:54:59,795
- No, I haven't.
- Yeah.

559
00:54:59,969 --> 00:55:03,385
You've been avoiding
the full glare of my disapproval.

560
00:55:03,556 --> 00:55:08,052
Yeah, well, it was... The show sucked
and everybody hated it. I'm sorry.

561
00:55:08,227 --> 00:55:11,596
Well, we don't normally do silence
on WNKW.

562
00:55:11,772 --> 00:55:13,895
You almost managed a full minute.

563
00:55:14,066 --> 00:55:16,273
Well, I think I did
an okay recovery, so...

564
00:55:16,444 --> 00:55:20,940
You got 11 more steps, do you?
Are they all gonna be on the air?

565
00:55:24,493 --> 00:55:29,202
I thought we were better than
some AM confessional...

566
00:55:29,373 --> 00:55:30,867
...but people are responding.

567
00:55:31,667 --> 00:55:36,128
I was wrong.
I'm big enough to admit it, so keep it up.

568
00:55:59,486 --> 00:56:01,230
Erica Bain?

569
00:56:02,906 --> 00:56:04,614
Erica Bain.

570
00:56:05,576 --> 00:56:07,901
I'm Detective Mercer. You...

571
00:56:10,205 --> 00:56:12,494
You remember me from last night?

572
00:56:14,376 --> 00:56:16,665
- Yeah.
- Yeah, well...

573
00:56:17,170 --> 00:56:21,085
...I saw you in the hospital after...

574
00:56:21,425 --> 00:56:24,461
After what had happened
to you and to your friend.

575
00:56:26,596 --> 00:56:27,675
My friend?

576
00:56:27,848 --> 00:56:31,679
Yeah. I stopped by your room, you know,
because I recognized your name.

577
00:56:31,851 --> 00:56:36,015
My wife, she used to listen to your show
all the time and...

578
00:56:36,314 --> 00:56:40,182
...that was why I stopped you
in the subway.

579
00:56:40,443 --> 00:56:42,021
I just wanted you to know that.

580
00:56:44,531 --> 00:56:46,108
Thank you.

581
00:56:49,702 --> 00:56:52,787
You know, it was disturbing.

582
00:56:53,957 --> 00:56:56,958
It really was. I mean, you were gone.

583
00:56:58,127 --> 00:57:01,212
And to see somebody...

584
00:57:01,548 --> 00:57:04,039
...that can't see you, it...

585
00:57:04,926 --> 00:57:06,550
But you're back now.

586
00:57:07,720 --> 00:57:10,092
Yeah, I'm back now.

587
00:57:10,264 --> 00:57:12,672
A lot of people don't make it back.

588
00:57:13,976 --> 00:57:15,636
I know that.

589
00:57:16,646 --> 00:57:20,015
I know you do. You see...

590
00:57:20,691 --> 00:57:22,067
...I checked into your case.

591
00:57:22,235 --> 00:57:25,520
- You checked into my case?
- Yeah.

592
00:57:25,947 --> 00:57:29,446
We got two of the best detectives
in this city that's working on this...

593
00:57:29,617 --> 00:57:31,823
...and we will find them.

594
00:57:31,994 --> 00:57:33,323
We always do.

595
00:57:35,498 --> 00:57:38,415
Are policemen always so confident?

596
00:57:39,502 --> 00:57:41,079
Are you interviewing me now?

597
00:57:43,255 --> 00:57:45,663
- Yeah, I guess I am.
- Right.

598
00:57:46,634 --> 00:57:47,713
Okay.

599
00:57:48,677 --> 00:57:51,251
How long is this gonna take?

600
00:57:51,430 --> 00:57:55,179
Five minutes, tops.
We can do it over here.

601
00:57:57,770 --> 00:57:59,098
Yeah.

602
00:58:01,941 --> 00:58:05,060
When you first go to a crime scene...

603
00:58:05,277 --> 00:58:08,611
...what do you look for?
- Evidence.

604
00:58:09,114 --> 00:58:10,906
Okay, such as?

605
00:58:11,075 --> 00:58:13,032
Murder weapon, entry wound...

606
00:58:13,202 --> 00:58:16,867
...DNA samples, prints,
carbon fragments...

607
00:58:17,039 --> 00:58:18,866
...position of the corpse.

608
00:58:19,041 --> 00:58:21,911
It's amazing what a dead body
can tell you.

609
00:58:22,336 --> 00:58:24,127
So the dead do talk?

610
00:58:24,296 --> 00:58:26,704
Oh, yeah. Everybody talks.

611
00:58:26,882 --> 00:58:31,211
Now, most everybody lies.
But the dead can't.

612
00:58:31,637 --> 00:58:35,681
And then again, the lies
tell you things too, because...

613
00:58:35,974 --> 00:58:38,299
...people tell them for a reason.

614
00:58:38,935 --> 00:58:42,980
And those bodies at the subway,
what are they telling you?

615
00:58:43,523 --> 00:58:45,432
You read the paper.

616
00:58:45,734 --> 00:58:47,691
Should I believe what I read?

617
00:58:53,158 --> 00:58:55,364
You ever read about him?

618
00:58:58,079 --> 00:58:59,408
Why do I know him?

619
00:58:59,581 --> 00:59:02,950
That's Mr. Murrow. He owns the parking
out on Roosevelt Island.

620
00:59:03,918 --> 00:59:06,077
But that's not all he does.

621
00:59:06,463 --> 00:59:08,087
What else does he do?

622
00:59:11,342 --> 00:59:13,964
- You really wanna know?
- Yeah.

623
00:59:14,304 --> 00:59:15,714
Then this is off the record.

624
00:59:16,931 --> 00:59:18,342
Okay.

625
00:59:22,896 --> 00:59:27,189
He imports drugs, guns, people.
Whatever's in demand.

626
00:59:27,358 --> 00:59:29,267
Found three guys that had crossed him...

627
00:59:29,444 --> 00:59:33,773
...with their hands Superglued to a table
and expanding cement in their throats.

628
00:59:33,948 --> 00:59:35,988
Had his wife ready
to testify against him...

629
00:59:36,159 --> 00:59:39,278
...and then she's found with her brains
blown out, gun in her hand.

630
00:59:39,454 --> 00:59:41,577
Nothing adds up except his lawyers.

631
00:59:41,748 --> 00:59:43,787
Now he's got custody
of his stepdaughter...

632
00:59:43,958 --> 00:59:46,283
...and not for sentimental reasons.

633
00:59:46,461 --> 00:59:48,868
But he knows she knows something...

634
00:59:49,046 --> 00:59:51,881
...and I hate to think what's
gonna happen to her. But...

635
00:59:52,800 --> 00:59:55,006
...maybe you know a nicer side.

636
00:59:59,724 --> 01:00:01,681
And why can't you nail him?

637
01:00:03,144 --> 01:00:04,721
Because I follow the law.

638
01:00:05,730 --> 01:00:07,354
Well, there's nothing you can do?

639
01:00:07,982 --> 01:00:09,690
Nothing that's legal.

640
01:00:12,736 --> 01:00:14,444
I didn't say that.

641
01:00:14,989 --> 01:00:16,732
I didn't hear it.

642
01:00:22,121 --> 01:00:23,152
Thank you.

643
01:00:23,497 --> 01:00:25,406
<i>Nothing that's legal.</i>

644
01:00:29,336 --> 01:00:30,367
So...

645
01:00:30,796 --> 01:00:33,002
...there's nothing you can do?

646
01:00:33,674 --> 01:00:37,090
No. No matter how bad I feel about it.

647
01:00:37,719 --> 01:00:40,970
I petitioned that she be made
a ward of the court...

648
01:00:41,140 --> 01:00:45,137
...but his lawyers killed that one
stone dead, so...

649
01:00:47,437 --> 01:00:49,229
Ever shot anyone?

650
01:00:51,775 --> 01:00:53,234
Yeah.

651
01:00:54,319 --> 01:00:56,312
Did your hands shake?

652
01:00:59,157 --> 01:01:00,652
No.

653
01:01:01,368 --> 01:01:05,200
But that's one of the benefits
of being on the right side.

654
01:01:05,372 --> 01:01:11,077
A benefit that that asshole and
the subway shooter don't have.

655
01:01:11,545 --> 01:01:13,454
And you think they're the same?

656
01:01:14,923 --> 01:01:17,840
They both walked away from a murder,
didn't they?

657
01:01:19,427 --> 01:01:20,708
Let me ask you a question.

658
01:01:21,888 --> 01:01:23,548
Just us.

659
01:01:26,893 --> 01:01:28,969
How did you...

660
01:01:31,022 --> 01:01:33,691
...pull it back together
after what happened to you?

661
01:01:36,903 --> 01:01:38,528
You don't.

662
01:01:39,364 --> 01:01:40,988
I'm sorry.

663
01:01:41,157 --> 01:01:42,735
- No, no.
- Jacked-up question, man.

664
01:01:42,909 --> 01:01:45,482
It's a fair question. You...

665
01:01:47,914 --> 01:01:49,906
You become someone else.

666
01:01:54,629 --> 01:01:56,503
A stranger.

667
01:02:04,430 --> 01:02:07,052
You must have loved him very much.

668
01:02:07,225 --> 01:02:08,683
Yeah.

669
01:02:10,645 --> 01:02:16,268
Sometimes that just makes it harder,
you know. You just wish you didn't.

670
01:02:17,443 --> 01:02:21,108
So, come on, some more cop stuff.

671
01:02:21,364 --> 01:02:24,199
- Or are we done?
- No, l... We're good.

672
01:02:25,785 --> 01:02:27,409
Thanks.

673
01:02:27,620 --> 01:02:30,786
And... here.

674
01:02:30,956 --> 01:02:32,996
That's my card. You...

675
01:02:33,334 --> 01:02:36,916
You wanna talk about your case,
you can call me. Any time.

676
01:02:38,047 --> 01:02:39,755
I warn you...

677
01:02:40,007 --> 01:02:41,335
...I don't sleep.

678
01:02:43,636 --> 01:02:45,427
Neither do I.

679
01:03:11,955 --> 01:03:14,529
<i>I walk the streets at night now.</i>

680
01:03:15,083 --> 01:03:18,998
<i>I find places and things
I never knew existed.</i>

681
01:03:19,338 --> 01:03:23,916
<i>But am I finding them
or are they finding me?</i>

682
01:03:27,763 --> 01:03:28,961
<i>Ever shot anyone?</i>

683
01:03:30,348 --> 01:03:31,926
<i>Yes.</i>

684
01:03:32,309 --> 01:03:34,432
<i>Did your hands shake?</i>

685
01:03:36,855 --> 01:03:42,311
<i>No, that's one of the benefits
of being on the right side.</i>

686
01:03:42,777 --> 01:03:47,486
<i>That from a police detective covering
last night's subway shooting.</i>

687
01:03:47,657 --> 01:03:51,607
<i>And like all good cops,
he believes in the law...</i>

688
01:03:51,786 --> 01:03:56,413
<i>... in right and wrong,
and the thin, fragile line between them.</i>

689
01:03:58,168 --> 01:04:01,619
<i>And he's probably wondering,
as I speak...</i>

690
01:04:02,464 --> 01:04:05,001
<i>... why is somebody
doing his job for him?</i>

691
01:04:17,895 --> 01:04:19,603
Hey, baby.

692
01:04:21,149 --> 01:04:24,315
- Hello.
- What's up, honey?

693
01:04:24,527 --> 01:04:26,021
Not much.

694
01:04:26,237 --> 01:04:29,571
So, what would 50 dollars do for you?

695
01:04:32,577 --> 01:04:35,115
- Shouldn't she be at home?
- She got no home.

696
01:04:35,288 --> 01:04:37,280
Have you, honey?

697
01:04:40,209 --> 01:04:43,293
- Where to?
- Come on in.

698
01:04:46,632 --> 01:04:50,333
- Looking for a show in the back seat?
- Oh, yeah.

699
01:04:56,559 --> 01:04:57,757
What's your name, honey?

700
01:05:00,229 --> 01:05:01,260
Chloe.

701
01:05:02,606 --> 01:05:05,441
What's he got in mind, Chloe?

702
01:05:06,360 --> 01:05:08,933
The little whore needs a mommy.

703
01:05:10,030 --> 01:05:12,070
Are you a mommy?

704
01:05:13,575 --> 01:05:15,651
You're a whore, right?

705
01:05:15,869 --> 01:05:17,827
I'm collecting whores.

706
01:05:17,997 --> 01:05:20,119
You know them suicide bombers
over in Iraq?

707
01:05:20,290 --> 01:05:23,208
When they die they want 72 virgins.
Me, I want whores.

708
01:05:23,752 --> 01:05:25,163
I want them while I'm alive.

709
01:05:25,337 --> 01:05:29,121
You know, Chloe and I
are gonna take a little walk.

710
01:05:32,177 --> 01:05:36,638
- You ain't going nowhere.
- Never get in the car.

711
01:05:37,641 --> 01:05:39,598
How long have you been in it?

712
01:05:40,602 --> 01:05:42,061
Four...

713
01:05:43,647 --> 01:05:47,182
...five, six days.

714
01:05:47,526 --> 01:05:49,150
Since...

715
01:05:50,320 --> 01:05:52,609
Since Vegas.

716
01:05:53,865 --> 01:05:56,985
But you wanna go now, don't you?

717
01:05:57,869 --> 01:05:59,150
Yes.

718
01:05:59,454 --> 01:06:02,289
Are you giving me grief again?

719
01:06:02,457 --> 01:06:05,458
Oh, my, got us a supercunt here.

720
01:06:05,669 --> 01:06:07,875
Open the doors.

721
01:06:08,171 --> 01:06:09,796
And if I don't?

722
01:06:09,965 --> 01:06:12,919
Then I'll be the last supercunt
you'll ever see.

723
01:06:15,845 --> 01:06:17,470
Get out of the car, Chloe. Go on.

724
01:06:18,014 --> 01:06:19,971
Not until he pays me.

725
01:06:20,266 --> 01:06:22,176
All right, pay the girl.

726
01:06:22,727 --> 01:06:25,645
Come on! Easy.

727
01:06:32,195 --> 01:06:33,274
All of it.

728
01:06:36,366 --> 01:06:37,860
All of it!

729
01:06:52,256 --> 01:06:54,213
Come on, walk.

730
01:06:54,383 --> 01:06:58,002
Don't turn around. Just keep going.

731
01:06:59,222 --> 01:07:02,388
You got a family back there, Chloe,
in Vegas?

732
01:07:02,558 --> 01:07:05,725
No. I went there from Albuquerque.

733
01:07:05,895 --> 01:07:08,302
Well, you got enough money
to get you home now.

734
01:07:12,693 --> 01:07:14,235
Ain't you a sad whore?

735
01:07:14,737 --> 01:07:15,768
Get out of the way!

736
01:07:29,126 --> 01:07:30,620
Hey. Hey!

737
01:07:30,794 --> 01:07:33,665
You're okay. You're okay, come on.

738
01:07:33,964 --> 01:07:36,004
Let me turn you over.

739
01:07:36,175 --> 01:07:39,923
All right. I'm so sorry. Here.

740
01:07:42,765 --> 01:07:44,425
Is this...

741
01:07:44,767 --> 01:07:46,177
...still America?

742
01:07:46,351 --> 01:07:48,474
Yeah. Your leg is broken.

743
01:07:51,023 --> 01:07:53,311
Who the hell are you?

744
01:07:54,067 --> 01:07:55,941
I'm nobody.

745
01:08:04,411 --> 01:08:05,691
<i>There is no going back...</i>

746
01:08:06,663 --> 01:08:08,537
<i>... to that other.</i>

747
01:08:08,790 --> 01:08:10,783
<i>She is gone.</i>

748
01:08:11,043 --> 01:08:14,791
<i>This thing, this stranger...</i>

749
01:08:15,130 --> 01:08:17,336
<i>... it's all you are now.</i>

750
01:08:23,805 --> 01:08:25,762
You walking out the heat?

751
01:08:25,932 --> 01:08:27,261
Yeah.

752
01:08:28,476 --> 01:08:30,101
Are you all right?

753
01:08:30,729 --> 01:08:32,353
Your hands are cold as ice.

754
01:08:34,816 --> 01:08:37,485
Your lipstick is smudged.

755
01:08:41,239 --> 01:08:43,528
Erica. Erica!

756
01:08:47,328 --> 01:08:49,368
You never said my name before.

757
01:08:49,539 --> 01:08:51,033
I heard your show.

758
01:08:51,416 --> 01:08:53,455
Right and wrong?

759
01:08:58,089 --> 01:09:00,758
Ballistic tests have linked
last night's shooting...

760
01:09:00,925 --> 01:09:04,508
...with the shooting from the market
and the shooting from the subway, so...

761
01:09:04,679 --> 01:09:08,379
Are you saying...? You saying the same
gun was used in all three shootings?

762
01:09:08,558 --> 01:09:10,182
Well, that seems to be the case.

763
01:09:10,518 --> 01:09:11,681
Detective.

764
01:09:11,853 --> 01:09:14,723
Sources are saying the witness
can provide a description...

765
01:09:14,897 --> 01:09:17,934
...but has refused to talk.
- I'm sorry, can you repeat that?

766
01:09:18,109 --> 01:09:21,275
Has the witness refused
to provide a description?

767
01:09:23,072 --> 01:09:25,278
No, the witness is awake...

768
01:09:25,449 --> 01:09:29,529
...and she is coherent, and we will be
interviewing her shortly.

769
01:09:31,664 --> 01:09:34,237
Now, thank you, that's everything.
Chief.

770
01:09:34,875 --> 01:09:36,500
Please, everybody, please.

771
01:09:36,669 --> 01:09:39,456
That's all the information
we're prepared to release.

772
01:09:39,630 --> 01:09:41,373
Thank you very much.

773
01:09:48,180 --> 01:09:49,556
Hey.

774
01:09:50,850 --> 01:09:54,468
- You handled yourself well back there.
- I tried.

775
01:09:54,645 --> 01:09:58,180
So, what, is this guy
becoming an obsession with you?

776
01:09:58,440 --> 01:10:01,014
No, my interest is in you.

777
01:10:01,944 --> 01:10:03,521
Why me?

778
01:10:03,988 --> 01:10:09,326
Well, because you seem like a good man,
you know? Like a good cop.

779
01:10:10,327 --> 01:10:13,328
Yeah, well, ain't nobody
doing my job for me.

780
01:10:13,580 --> 01:10:15,122
You heard my show.

781
01:10:15,541 --> 01:10:17,035
Yeah.

782
01:10:17,209 --> 01:10:19,961
You gotta think every one of those
reporters in that room...

783
01:10:20,128 --> 01:10:22,750
...is gonna sensationalize this.

784
01:10:23,298 --> 01:10:24,579
But not you.

785
01:10:25,008 --> 01:10:26,965
You're better than that.

786
01:10:28,762 --> 01:10:29,960
How can you tell?

787
01:10:32,265 --> 01:10:33,510
Your show.

788
01:10:33,684 --> 01:10:36,519
- My show?
- Yeah.

789
01:10:37,312 --> 01:10:39,518
You see, my wife...

790
01:10:39,731 --> 01:10:41,938
...she didn't listen to it.
- No?

791
01:10:42,109 --> 01:10:43,353
I did.

792
01:10:45,821 --> 01:10:48,228
Well, you don't fit our audience profile.

793
01:10:48,406 --> 01:10:51,158
- Yeah, and you don't fit your voice either.
- I don't?

794
01:10:52,202 --> 01:10:56,780
No, you're a whole lot cuter
and about 100 pounds lighter.

795
01:11:00,710 --> 01:11:01,908
How's the girl doing?

796
01:11:03,797 --> 01:11:07,581
She's pretty banged up.
Yeah, but we'll know more tomorrow.

797
01:11:09,177 --> 01:11:10,801
Well...

798
01:11:12,597 --> 01:11:14,636
I hope she's all right.

799
01:11:14,849 --> 01:11:16,260
Yeah.

800
01:11:28,237 --> 01:11:29,981
- Hi.
- Hey.

801
01:11:31,657 --> 01:11:33,650
You see those pictures
of the subway thing?

802
01:11:33,826 --> 01:11:35,700
- Gross.
- They shot another one last night.

803
01:11:35,870 --> 01:11:38,657
- Some pervert.
- Who will they go for next, Donald Trump?

804
01:11:38,831 --> 01:11:41,322
- No, that's incitement.
- And justified.

805
01:11:41,501 --> 01:11:44,205
- Wish he'd take care of my ex.
- You think that's funny?

806
01:11:44,378 --> 01:11:47,000
I suppose you think
lethal injections funny too.

807
01:11:47,173 --> 01:11:50,293
- Funny like strange, or funny "ha, ha"?
- You're sick, you know that?

808
01:11:50,468 --> 01:11:52,425
You're all sick.

809
01:11:59,477 --> 01:12:03,770
I'm thinking about opening up your
show. I want you to take phone-ins.

810
01:12:03,939 --> 01:12:07,024
- On what?
- You heard them.

811
01:12:07,276 --> 01:12:10,443
You mean the shootings?
The vigilante thing?

812
01:12:10,613 --> 01:12:13,816
- You really think that that's appropriate?
- Why not?

813
01:12:13,991 --> 01:12:17,027
Well, I thought you said
you didn't like that kind of thing.

814
01:12:17,202 --> 01:12:20,287
I don't. But you're good at it.

815
01:12:20,581 --> 01:12:24,116
- How am I good at it?
- You're a survivor.

816
01:12:24,293 --> 01:12:27,163
- I'm not asking you to personalize it.
- Oh, you're not?

817
01:12:27,338 --> 01:12:29,626
No more than you already have.

818
01:12:31,091 --> 01:12:34,211
<i>"The essential American soul is hard...</i>

819
01:12:34,636 --> 01:12:38,337
...isolate, stoic, and a killer.

820
01:12:38,515 --> 01:12:40,804
It has never yet melted."

821
01:12:41,268 --> 01:12:43,225
I quote that from D.H. Lawrence...

822
01:12:43,395 --> 01:12:46,811
...because someone
is playing God out there...

823
01:12:46,982 --> 01:12:49,983
...killing in the name of justice,
in this...

824
01:12:50,152 --> 01:12:52,821
...the safest big city in the world.

825
01:12:52,988 --> 01:12:57,864
And because I've been asked today to do
something that we've never done before:

826
01:12:58,035 --> 01:13:00,157
Take calls from our listeners
on the subject.

827
01:13:00,328 --> 01:13:03,080
This is a new departure for us but
we wanna hear from you...

828
01:13:03,248 --> 01:13:08,587
...so call 212-165-9990.

829
01:13:09,504 --> 01:13:11,580
First caller. Hi, you're on the air.

830
01:13:11,756 --> 01:13:14,710
<i>As far as I'm concerned,
he's doing us a favor.</i>

831
01:13:14,885 --> 01:13:15,916
And why is that?

832
01:13:16,094 --> 01:13:18,087
<i>Because no matter what
the media tells us...</i>

833
01:13:18,263 --> 01:13:20,836
<i>... crimes are being committed,
and he's cleaning it up.</i>

834
01:13:21,016 --> 01:13:22,973
And you think
he has the right to do that.

835
01:13:23,143 --> 01:13:25,384
<i>- Well, yeah.
- Next caller. You're on the air.</i>

836
01:13:25,770 --> 01:13:27,644
<i>You're talking about murder.</i>

837
01:13:27,814 --> 01:13:29,605
<i>The death penalty without a trial.</i>

838
01:13:29,774 --> 01:13:33,226
<i>The vigilante is just like the people
he's killing. He should be in jail.</i>

839
01:13:33,403 --> 01:13:35,194
Well, maybe he will. Next caller.

840
01:13:35,363 --> 01:13:36,394
<i>You're on the air.</i>

841
01:13:36,573 --> 01:13:39,194
<i>It's less about what he's doing
than how it makes us feel.</i>

842
01:13:39,367 --> 01:13:40,778
<i>There's not a person I know...</i>

843
01:13:40,952 --> 01:13:43,194
<i>... doesn't get a jolt of
pleasure when they hear...</i>

844
01:13:43,371 --> 01:13:45,613
<i>- Pleasure?
- Yeah, revenge makes us feel good.</i>

845
01:13:45,790 --> 01:13:48,032
<i>That's why we have war,
why we got the death...</i>

846
01:13:48,209 --> 01:13:51,376
<i>- Next caller, you're on the air.
- I think it's good for New York.</i>

847
01:13:51,546 --> 01:13:53,871
<i>I mean, this city
was turning into Disneyland.</i>

848
01:13:54,048 --> 01:13:57,298
<i>- We're getting our street cred back.
- Next caller. You're on the air.</i>

849
01:13:57,510 --> 01:14:01,638
<i>What is wrong with our society, that this
kind of thing can even get on radio?</i>

850
01:14:01,806 --> 01:14:04,807
<i>Revenge, murder, vigilante killings?</i>

851
01:14:04,976 --> 01:14:07,763
<i>Hasn't the whole Iraqi debacle
taught us anything?</i>

852
01:14:07,937 --> 01:14:09,597
<i>"Waste the bad guys, bring them on."</i>

853
01:14:09,772 --> 01:14:12,345
<i>I've been a fan of yours.
I can 't even believe you're...</i>

854
01:14:12,525 --> 01:14:14,268
Neither can I. You're on the air.

855
01:14:14,443 --> 01:14:18,192
<i>I wonder if the vigilante has a girlfriend
because there's something sexy about...</i>

856
01:14:18,364 --> 01:14:20,155
<i>- Sexy?
- Yeah, completely.</i>

857
01:14:20,324 --> 01:14:22,732
<i>And if he's listening, my number is 2...</i>

858
01:14:22,910 --> 01:14:25,615
<i>- You're on the line.
- This is the vigilante calling.</i>

859
01:14:25,788 --> 01:14:28,658
<i>I'm the man that takes care of business.
That chick can have...</i>

860
01:14:38,175 --> 01:14:41,342
- I need to talk to someone.
- Ma'am, can I help you?

861
01:14:42,304 --> 01:14:43,680
Yeah.

862
01:14:45,599 --> 01:14:47,508
I need to talk to someone
about a homicide.

863
01:14:47,685 --> 01:14:49,227
Names?

864
01:14:50,938 --> 01:14:52,681
Erica Bain.

865
01:14:52,981 --> 01:14:54,808
She was the victim?

866
01:14:56,276 --> 01:14:59,859
No. She wasn't the victim.

867
01:15:01,240 --> 01:15:02,948
She was the...

868
01:15:03,784 --> 01:15:07,034
- She's...
- No "Erica Bain" under homicide.

869
01:15:08,205 --> 01:15:09,913
Well, maybe there should be.

870
01:15:10,082 --> 01:15:11,955
- You know?
- Pardon me?

871
01:15:15,253 --> 01:15:16,712
Nothing.

872
01:15:19,716 --> 01:15:21,376
<i>You gonna give me
some Radiohead too?</i>

873
01:15:22,010 --> 01:15:23,291
<i>Fucking woman!</i>

874
01:15:23,470 --> 01:15:27,468
<i>Are you a mommy?
You're a whore, right?</i>

875
01:15:30,268 --> 01:15:32,060
Erica?

876
01:15:34,814 --> 01:15:36,522
Is that you?

877
01:15:38,652 --> 01:15:41,569
<i>- Because I could not stop for Death...
- Erica?</i>

878
01:15:41,738 --> 01:15:43,814
<i>... he kindly stopped for me.</i>

879
01:15:43,990 --> 01:15:45,153
Erica?

880
01:15:45,325 --> 01:15:48,776
<i>The carriage held but just ourselves.
And Immortality.</i>

881
01:15:48,953 --> 01:15:50,613
Erica?

882
01:16:06,471 --> 01:16:08,013
<i>Mercer.</i>

883
01:16:08,181 --> 01:16:09,889
Hey, it's me, Erica.

884
01:16:12,060 --> 01:16:13,684
I know.

885
01:16:14,103 --> 01:16:16,890
<i>- Is everything okay?
- Yeah, I...</i>

886
01:16:18,274 --> 01:16:23,232
I just wanted to talk and l...
For some reason, I thought of you.

887
01:16:24,322 --> 01:16:26,149
<i>Okay.</i>

888
01:16:27,158 --> 01:16:28,901
<i>What's going on?</i>

889
01:16:29,702 --> 01:16:31,908
What do you do when you can't sleep?

890
01:16:35,207 --> 01:16:37,414
<i>- Nothing.
- Isn't that hard?</i>

891
01:16:37,960 --> 01:16:39,668
To do nothing?

892
01:16:40,713 --> 01:16:43,465
<i>Well, you sort of get used to it.</i>

893
01:16:53,017 --> 01:16:54,048
Erica?

894
01:16:54,894 --> 01:16:56,970
<i>Well, come on, what's happening?
Talk to me.</i>

895
01:16:57,146 --> 01:17:00,349
Did you sleep better
when your wife was beside you?

896
01:17:01,233 --> 01:17:03,025
I know I did.

897
01:17:04,028 --> 01:17:09,270
I couldn't feel my body unless his arms
were wrapped around me.

898
01:17:09,700 --> 01:17:12,487
<i>Yeah, well, my wife, she used to...</i>

899
01:17:13,370 --> 01:17:15,279
<i>... flip through the night.</i>

900
01:17:16,081 --> 01:17:18,916
So I called her a mackerel.

901
01:17:20,669 --> 01:17:24,501
I guess that's not the worst thing
in the world to wake up to.

902
01:17:25,424 --> 01:17:28,959
<i>Hey, you want me to stay on the phone
with you until you go to sleep?</i>

903
01:17:29,136 --> 01:17:30,511
No.

904
01:17:31,889 --> 01:17:33,632
You've been good to me.

905
01:17:35,183 --> 01:17:36,346
<i>Sleep tight.</i>

906
01:17:51,158 --> 01:17:52,533
Yeah.

907
01:17:53,201 --> 01:17:54,660
How late?

908
01:17:55,036 --> 01:17:59,283
Look, I'm not busting your balls. You
told me it'd be there and it better be.

909
01:18:35,660 --> 01:18:37,451
Why do you think you can hurt people?

910
01:18:38,037 --> 01:18:40,362
- What?
- Just do damage and walk away.

911
01:18:41,541 --> 01:18:43,332
Don't you know what you leave behind?

912
01:18:43,501 --> 01:18:45,577
- Do I know you?
- Do you think about it?

913
01:18:47,213 --> 01:18:49,289
Does it keep you up at night?

914
01:18:50,508 --> 01:18:52,880
- Does it haunt you?
- Excuse me?

915
01:18:53,052 --> 01:18:54,167
Because it haunts me.

916
01:18:54,470 --> 01:18:56,676
Are you one of them
press paparazzo freaks?

917
01:18:56,847 --> 01:18:58,923
You got a fucking camera there?

918
01:18:59,267 --> 01:19:01,389
You can't take my fucking picture.

919
01:19:01,560 --> 01:19:04,976
You're gonna come to my fucking place
and take my fucking picture?

920
01:19:07,858 --> 01:19:09,139
You fuck!

921
01:19:09,860 --> 01:19:12,647
- You a fucking cop?
- You wish.

922
01:19:12,947 --> 01:19:15,734
Well, it looks like he fell from up there.

923
01:19:16,283 --> 01:19:20,151
Cause of death could be the fall. It
could be the crowbar stuck in his skull.

924
01:19:20,329 --> 01:19:22,571
I'd say 50-50 either way.

925
01:19:22,957 --> 01:19:24,451
Shit.

926
01:19:24,625 --> 01:19:26,618
Maybe 70-30.

927
01:19:27,461 --> 01:19:31,541
I mean, come on, man. How many people
wanted this prick dead? Besides us?

928
01:19:31,715 --> 01:19:35,795
Too many.
The problem is he knew all of them.

929
01:19:35,969 --> 01:19:38,176
He wouldn't let anybody
get this close to him.

930
01:19:38,347 --> 01:19:41,882
You think someone did us a favor?
Maybe we should put him on the payroll.

931
01:19:42,059 --> 01:19:44,728
What, like someone think
they're doing our job for us?

932
01:19:44,895 --> 01:19:48,098
Saying, " Hey, New York's finest,
I'm gonna send you a little message.

933
01:19:48,273 --> 01:19:49,353
This is how it's done."

934
01:19:50,400 --> 01:19:51,943
- Get a shot right there.
- Officer!

935
01:19:52,110 --> 01:19:54,103
Here we go. All right, I'll be back.

936
01:19:54,863 --> 01:19:56,939
Erica, are you okay? Oh, my God.

937
01:19:57,115 --> 01:19:59,322
- Get out.
- My God!

938
01:19:59,493 --> 01:20:02,447
- Get away!
- No, I won't get away.

939
01:20:03,330 --> 01:20:06,414
Don't touch me. I'm sick!

940
01:20:06,875 --> 01:20:08,998
I can see that.

941
01:20:13,548 --> 01:20:16,253
- We have to get you to a hospital.
- No.

942
01:20:16,426 --> 01:20:17,671
No.

943
01:20:17,844 --> 01:20:20,798
- Why not?
- I can't because...

944
01:20:21,014 --> 01:20:23,303
Oh, God. I can't.

945
01:20:25,352 --> 01:20:28,187
What kind of trouble are you in?

946
01:20:29,314 --> 01:20:30,808
You don't wanna know.

947
01:21:24,160 --> 01:21:26,283
Were you a nurse?

948
01:21:26,537 --> 01:21:28,695
When I had to be.

949
01:21:30,333 --> 01:21:32,954
This is going to leave a scar.

950
01:21:37,757 --> 01:21:40,426
I killed a man tonight.

951
01:21:42,052 --> 01:21:44,590
Because he did this to you?

952
01:21:45,848 --> 01:21:47,259
No.

953
01:21:48,893 --> 01:21:51,466
I would've killed him anyway.

954
01:21:55,149 --> 01:21:56,940
Back home...

955
01:21:57,735 --> 01:22:00,771
...they gave young boys guns.

956
01:22:02,281 --> 01:22:04,154
Made them kill their parents.

957
01:22:05,367 --> 01:22:07,609
Just to show us...

958
01:22:09,204 --> 01:22:10,782
...anyone...

959
01:22:11,165 --> 01:22:13,287
...can cross that line.

960
01:22:15,252 --> 01:22:17,707
Anyone can be a killer.

961
01:22:20,465 --> 01:22:23,135
Each death leaves a hole...

962
01:22:23,677 --> 01:22:25,835
...waiting to be filled.

963
01:22:34,104 --> 01:22:36,974
Did the ME come back
with his liver temperature yet?

964
01:22:37,149 --> 01:22:40,980
Yeah, he's about... Dead about two hours
from when we got there.

965
01:22:41,361 --> 01:22:46,486
<i>- So that puts us at what time?
- About 1 :00, give or take.</i>

966
01:22:47,200 --> 01:22:48,575
Damn.

967
01:22:49,452 --> 01:22:54,031
Okay, I want everyone from the subway
and from that market killing...

968
01:22:54,207 --> 01:22:57,161
...I want them all brought in again.
- We've done all of that.

969
01:22:57,335 --> 01:23:00,170
We need to do it again.
We need to think outside the box.

970
01:23:00,338 --> 01:23:03,173
But he hit him with a crowbar,
hefted him over the rail.

971
01:23:03,341 --> 01:23:06,792
We're talking about a different guy
here, man. Think about it.

972
01:23:07,971 --> 01:23:09,595
Maybe.

973
01:23:10,265 --> 01:23:13,598
What about the iPod?
You said it traced back to a kid.

974
01:23:13,768 --> 01:23:16,224
I thought I told you.
The kid's father is an attorney.

975
01:23:16,396 --> 01:23:18,519
- He wants a subpoena, but I'm on it.
- Get him.

976
01:23:18,690 --> 01:23:21,856
- Whatever you gotta do...
- All right. I'll call right now.

977
01:23:29,283 --> 01:23:31,276
Hey, Erica.

978
01:23:32,245 --> 01:23:35,032
No, I just wanna know how you slept.

979
01:23:35,873 --> 01:23:38,198
Hey, you wanna see what I do?

980
01:23:38,918 --> 01:23:43,829
Well, meet me over at Wynnward
Hospital in Washington Heights.

981
01:23:44,006 --> 01:23:46,046
You'll get an idea.

982
01:23:46,717 --> 01:23:51,712
<i>East 14 and Broadway, East 14 and
Broadway. None confirmed at the time.</i>

983
01:23:57,561 --> 01:23:59,637
Why doesn't he march here?

984
01:23:59,814 --> 01:24:02,768
- March down the street.
- Ethan Grant, my man.

985
01:24:02,942 --> 01:24:05,611
Now sit your hippie ass down.

986
01:24:05,778 --> 01:24:07,569
You smoking pot?

987
01:24:07,822 --> 01:24:10,775
- I need to talk to you.
- My dad said not to get involved.

988
01:24:10,950 --> 01:24:13,867
Oh, yeah? Does your dad know
you smoke grass, huh?

989
01:24:14,036 --> 01:24:16,657
That's a lot more than
a misdemeanor these days.

990
01:24:16,830 --> 01:24:19,203
- Listen, I didn't see anything.
- I think you did.

991
01:24:19,375 --> 01:24:22,957
- Look at me. Hey, you selling this shit?
- No.

992
01:24:23,128 --> 01:24:24,457
Well, I believe you.

993
01:24:24,630 --> 01:24:28,497
Maybe a judge won't. Come on, Skippy.
Get your shit. Let's go. Come on.

994
01:24:36,099 --> 01:24:37,926
- Hey. Thanks for coming.
- Hey.

995
01:24:38,101 --> 01:24:39,299
Sure.

996
01:24:39,478 --> 01:24:42,562
- Nice jacket.
- Thanks.

997
01:24:42,981 --> 01:24:45,223
So, what time
you got to sleep last night?

998
01:24:45,400 --> 01:24:47,891
I don't know, pretty soon
after we hung up, I guess.

999
01:24:48,070 --> 01:24:51,439
<i>- About 1, 1 :30?
- Yeah. Something like that.</i>

1000
01:24:51,615 --> 01:24:54,984
Yeah. I ended up working all night.

1001
01:24:56,369 --> 01:24:59,785
You know you're not gonna be able
to reference this on your show?

1002
01:24:59,956 --> 01:25:02,282
Sure, if I knew what this was.

1003
01:25:02,667 --> 01:25:05,704
We're gonna interview
a witness to a shooting.

1004
01:25:06,713 --> 01:25:09,382
- Isn't that against procedure?
- Yeah.

1005
01:25:09,549 --> 01:25:11,458
But I've tried to talk to her twice...

1006
01:25:11,635 --> 01:25:14,090
...and she seemed real nervous
to talk to me.

1007
01:25:14,262 --> 01:25:16,800
I figure maybe if you were there,
she'll talk.

1008
01:25:16,973 --> 01:25:18,551
Why me?

1009
01:25:18,850 --> 01:25:20,890
Because you got me to talk.

1010
01:25:30,778 --> 01:25:32,486
Hi, Chloe.

1011
01:25:35,491 --> 01:25:37,567
How are we feeling today?

1012
01:25:38,411 --> 01:25:39,953
All right.

1013
01:25:44,542 --> 01:25:46,369
I brought a friend.

1014
01:25:50,131 --> 01:25:51,874
Hi, Chloe.

1015
01:25:57,388 --> 01:25:59,297
Hi.

1016
01:26:13,821 --> 01:26:17,155
So you feel like telling me what
happened to you that night now?

1017
01:26:34,008 --> 01:26:36,380
That's a pretty necklace.

1018
01:26:45,728 --> 01:26:47,886
You should tell them what you saw.

1019
01:26:49,022 --> 01:26:52,438
Whatever it was, tell them the truth.

1020
01:26:56,780 --> 01:26:58,654
It's okay.

1021
01:27:02,828 --> 01:27:04,536
I saw...

1022
01:27:11,211 --> 01:27:13,417
I saw nobody.

1023
01:27:15,924 --> 01:27:19,044
Come on, Chloe.
Tell me the truth now, all right?

1024
01:27:21,763 --> 01:27:23,222
And nobody saw me.

1025
01:27:32,023 --> 01:27:33,648
Okay.

1026
01:27:34,234 --> 01:27:36,108
Sorry if that upset you.

1027
01:27:37,487 --> 01:27:40,821
Well, I'm sorry that
I couldn't be more help back there.

1028
01:27:40,991 --> 01:27:43,944
Well, you definitely seemed to help her.

1029
01:27:44,119 --> 01:27:46,325
She sure liked your...

1030
01:27:46,496 --> 01:27:48,239
...necklace.

1031
01:27:48,415 --> 01:27:50,407
It meant a lot to me.

1032
01:27:59,259 --> 01:28:00,967
Erica?

1033
01:28:01,803 --> 01:28:05,468
- Yeah.
- Why'd you call me last night?

1034
01:28:06,516 --> 01:28:08,888
I told you, I couldn't sleep.

1035
01:28:10,353 --> 01:28:12,345
And you were in bed?

1036
01:28:13,064 --> 01:28:16,433
No. I couldn't sleep.

1037
01:28:26,160 --> 01:28:28,734
You wanna tell us again
why you didn't wanna come in?

1038
01:28:28,913 --> 01:28:32,448
- For what? To get back my iPod?
- Hey, watch your ass.

1039
01:28:32,625 --> 01:28:35,330
I don't know. I had mixed feelings.

1040
01:28:35,503 --> 01:28:38,124
I mean, I was kind of glad
those guys got killed.

1041
01:28:38,297 --> 01:28:41,915
- You were glad?
- Yeah. I know I shouldn't be, but I was.

1042
01:28:42,093 --> 01:28:46,173
- While we're young, give us a statement.
- Look, I didn't see any vigilante.

1043
01:28:46,347 --> 01:28:48,470
Those guys smacked me around
and took my iPod.

1044
01:28:48,641 --> 01:28:51,392
Then they hassled some black dude
sitting next to his kid...

1045
01:28:51,560 --> 01:28:55,309
...so we all got off,
except for some woman at the back.

1046
01:28:55,689 --> 01:28:57,349
A woman.

1047
01:28:57,524 --> 01:29:00,940
Yeah, just a woman.
She was staying out of it.

1048
01:29:01,111 --> 01:29:03,187
Maybe the vigi guy got on
at the next stop.

1049
01:29:03,364 --> 01:29:08,191
Can you describe this woman well
enough for an artist to make a sketch?

1050
01:29:08,369 --> 01:29:09,649
I can try.

1051
01:29:10,371 --> 01:29:12,280
<i>Where are you going
with this woman thing?</i>

1052
01:29:13,082 --> 01:29:14,327
I'm not sure yet.

1053
01:29:16,001 --> 01:29:20,710
Women kill their kids, their husbands,
boyfriends, shit they love.

1054
01:29:20,881 --> 01:29:22,423
They don't do this.

1055
01:29:22,591 --> 01:29:24,133
- How you doing?
- They don't?

1056
01:29:24,301 --> 01:29:25,795
- Good.
- You need some more water?

1057
01:29:25,969 --> 01:29:27,463
- Nope.
- Okay.

1058
01:29:27,638 --> 01:29:30,722
Just think about the first moment
that you met her. All right?

1059
01:29:30,891 --> 01:29:33,263
Where you were, where she was.

1060
01:29:33,435 --> 01:29:35,760
Tell me anything that comes to mind.

1061
01:29:37,064 --> 01:29:39,103
She had light hair, I think.

1062
01:29:40,776 --> 01:29:45,484
And okay lips. And she was skinny.

1063
01:29:45,655 --> 01:29:50,732
But she had some ass.
You know, you could tell because...

1064
01:29:51,119 --> 01:29:54,702
- But you're not doing the ass, right?
- No.

1065
01:29:54,873 --> 01:29:56,497
Okay.

1066
01:29:57,751 --> 01:29:59,624
She had good skin.

1067
01:30:00,920 --> 01:30:02,747
It was smooth.

1068
01:30:02,922 --> 01:30:05,758
And nice breasts.

1069
01:30:05,925 --> 01:30:09,341
Yeah. Like, they were little,
like Kate Moss titties.

1070
01:30:09,512 --> 01:30:12,086
- But they looked good with...
- Try to focus on the face.

1071
01:30:12,265 --> 01:30:13,973
Oh, I'm sorry.

1072
01:30:15,477 --> 01:30:18,181
- Hey, you know what I do remember?
- What?

1073
01:30:18,354 --> 01:30:19,765
She was, like, on lockdown.

1074
01:30:21,691 --> 01:30:25,440
<i>I mean, shut off. Kind of scary.</i>

1075
01:31:17,454 --> 01:31:19,412
"It's not cream.

1076
01:31:21,542 --> 01:31:23,831
It's vanilla."

1077
01:31:31,844 --> 01:31:34,335
You left a hole in me.

1078
01:31:37,516 --> 01:31:39,509
But I'm done now.

1079
01:31:40,436 --> 01:31:42,095
You hear me?

1080
01:31:45,482 --> 01:31:47,226
I'm done now.

1081
01:31:51,780 --> 01:31:55,363
Great. It's Jennifer Aniston.
I knew he was bullshitting us.

1082
01:31:55,534 --> 01:31:58,404
No, not really. This is a phenomenon
that happens quite often.

1083
01:31:58,578 --> 01:32:00,867
The mind gets so saturated
with popular images...

1084
01:32:01,039 --> 01:32:05,084
...it's often difficult, especially for people
under 20, to recall something unique.

1085
01:32:05,252 --> 01:32:06,627
<i>That's Mr. Murrow.</i>

1086
01:32:06,795 --> 01:32:11,671
<i>He owns the parking out on
Roosevelt Island. That's not all he does.</i>

1087
01:32:12,092 --> 01:32:13,551
<i>What else does he do?</i>

1088
01:32:13,718 --> 01:32:16,636
<i>- You really wanna know?
- Yeah.</i>

1089
01:32:16,805 --> 01:32:19,011
<i>- Then this is off the record.
- Erica!</i>

1090
01:32:20,600 --> 01:32:22,308
Who is it?

1091
01:32:22,602 --> 01:32:26,766
It's Detective Mercer.
Could I have a minute with you?

1092
01:32:28,024 --> 01:32:30,313
Yeah. Yeah, just a second.

1093
01:32:41,579 --> 01:32:42,990
- Hey.
- Hey.

1094
01:32:43,706 --> 01:32:46,411
I tried to call, but there was no answer.

1095
01:32:46,918 --> 01:32:48,910
The ringer must be off.

1096
01:32:49,629 --> 01:32:53,757
- Can I come in?
- Yeah, sure. Come on in.

1097
01:33:01,224 --> 01:33:05,221
- It's pretty dark in here.
- I like it like that.

1098
01:33:09,565 --> 01:33:11,309
Got something...

1099
01:33:13,903 --> 01:33:15,694
Is this yours?

1100
01:33:18,491 --> 01:33:22,191
- Where'd you find it?
- Spanish Harlem.

1101
01:33:22,787 --> 01:33:27,994
A uniform pinched the suspect's
girlfriend trying to pawn it.

1102
01:33:28,459 --> 01:33:30,997
He fit the description that you gave.

1103
01:33:33,547 --> 01:33:35,291
Oh, my God.

1104
01:33:35,633 --> 01:33:37,008
I need a favor from you.

1105
01:33:37,760 --> 01:33:41,259
I'd like for you to come downtown
and ID him in a lineup.

1106
01:33:46,852 --> 01:33:48,560
No. I can't.

1107
01:33:48,729 --> 01:33:52,264
I understand you're nervous,
but you won't be alone in there.

1108
01:33:53,817 --> 01:33:55,644
I promise.

1109
01:34:00,991 --> 01:34:02,782
I'll get my stuff.

1110
01:34:06,413 --> 01:34:07,955
Thanks.

1111
01:34:33,023 --> 01:34:34,766
Okay, let's go.

1112
01:34:35,317 --> 01:34:38,982
You're going to view five subjects, and
then I'm gonna ask you three questions:

1113
01:34:39,154 --> 01:34:43,448
Do you recognize anyone? Where do you
know them from? And what did they do?

1114
01:34:44,701 --> 01:34:46,824
Lights and blinds.

1115
01:34:49,289 --> 01:34:51,696
Number one, approach the mirror.

1116
01:34:56,755 --> 01:34:58,297
No.

1117
01:34:58,631 --> 01:35:01,502
Sit down.
Number two, approach the mirror.

1118
01:35:04,387 --> 01:35:05,881
No.

1119
01:35:06,055 --> 01:35:08,725
Sit down.
Number three, approach the mirror.

1120
01:35:20,945 --> 01:35:22,356
No.

1121
01:35:23,072 --> 01:35:26,192
Sit down.
Number four, approach the mirror.

1122
01:35:29,328 --> 01:35:31,902
I can see them all. It's none of them.

1123
01:35:32,415 --> 01:35:35,084
Sit down. You're sure?

1124
01:35:35,251 --> 01:35:37,956
Yeah. I'm sorry.

1125
01:35:39,213 --> 01:35:40,755
I really am.

1126
01:35:42,508 --> 01:35:44,251
I'm so sorry.

1127
01:35:50,016 --> 01:35:53,764
Damn, I thought we had him.
You think she just froze up?

1128
01:35:53,936 --> 01:35:56,012
Doesn't really seem like the type,
you know?

1129
01:35:56,188 --> 01:35:57,220
I don't know.

1130
01:36:02,069 --> 01:36:04,607
- You okay?
- Yeah.

1131
01:36:04,780 --> 01:36:07,069
That looked like
it was pretty tough on you.

1132
01:36:07,241 --> 01:36:11,285
It was. I was kind of hoping
I was finally done.

1133
01:36:11,453 --> 01:36:14,454
Yeah, well, I'm off now.
Let's go get some food.

1134
01:36:14,623 --> 01:36:18,537
- No, I'm not hungry. That's okay.
- No, you need to eat.

1135
01:36:21,463 --> 01:36:24,381
I can barely remember his hands.

1136
01:36:24,633 --> 01:36:26,958
Perhaps you need to forget.

1137
01:36:27,803 --> 01:36:29,297
I can't.

1138
01:36:30,681 --> 01:36:33,006
I miss who I was with him.

1139
01:36:34,977 --> 01:36:36,934
You know that feeling?

1140
01:36:40,482 --> 01:36:41,941
You know...

1141
01:36:42,818 --> 01:36:47,645
...this is Mughal. It was a gift
from David's grandmother.

1142
01:36:52,744 --> 01:36:54,784
Speaking of gifts...

1143
01:36:56,915 --> 01:36:59,832
You know, someone gave me
a gift the other night.

1144
01:37:00,544 --> 01:37:01,954
Yeah?

1145
01:37:04,339 --> 01:37:09,084
You recall that guy we saw on TV
at the coffee shop?

1146
01:37:10,178 --> 01:37:14,805
The one I've been trying to put away
for three years.

1147
01:37:16,101 --> 01:37:18,888
Apparently somebody else
must've had something against him...

1148
01:37:19,062 --> 01:37:22,680
...because we're not talking
about a 9 mm here.

1149
01:37:23,191 --> 01:37:27,354
It got real personal.

1150
01:37:27,987 --> 01:37:29,861
Yeah, I read about it.

1151
01:37:38,706 --> 01:37:42,040
We got some more information
on that subway shooting.

1152
01:37:45,129 --> 01:37:47,881
Turns out there was a woman
on the car.

1153
01:37:48,716 --> 01:37:52,761
Now, all this time, we've been looking
for a man with a gun.

1154
01:37:53,721 --> 01:37:56,294
It was a woman with a grudge.

1155
01:37:59,018 --> 01:38:01,591
Well, I guess there's a lot of us
out there.

1156
01:38:09,236 --> 01:38:12,403
You know, Erica, when I was a rookie...

1157
01:38:14,492 --> 01:38:17,161
...I used to give myself this test.

1158
01:38:17,745 --> 01:38:23,166
I would ask myself, if there was someone
I knew that had committed a crime...

1159
01:38:23,751 --> 01:38:26,502
...would I have the fortitude
to put them away?

1160
01:38:29,089 --> 01:38:30,714
What kind of someone?

1161
01:38:31,759 --> 01:38:37,631
Someone close to me.
Like the best friend I could ever...

1162
01:38:38,724 --> 01:38:41,179
I could ever hope to have.

1163
01:38:44,146 --> 01:38:45,391
And...?

1164
01:38:47,357 --> 01:38:51,936
I always hoped that I would have the
courage and the dedication to say yes.

1165
01:38:54,781 --> 01:38:56,573
And do you?

1166
01:38:57,659 --> 01:38:59,319
I do.

1167
01:39:00,245 --> 01:39:03,163
And it's important that you know that.

1168
01:39:05,459 --> 01:39:07,119
I know that.

1169
01:39:08,837 --> 01:39:11,328
It's what I admire about you.

1170
01:39:21,433 --> 01:39:25,762
One more piece of evidence,
and she goes down.

1171
01:39:27,689 --> 01:39:29,931
And I'm sure you'll find it.

1172
01:39:30,734 --> 01:39:35,479
You're a good detective.
You miss nothing.

1173
01:39:38,491 --> 01:39:40,401
I have to go.

1174
01:39:42,662 --> 01:39:45,118
- I got it.
- Okay.

1175
01:39:45,290 --> 01:39:46,950
Hang on.

1176
01:39:47,584 --> 01:39:49,126
Hey.

1177
01:39:58,261 --> 01:40:02,508
- I wonder what David would think of...
- Think of what?

1178
01:40:06,686 --> 01:40:09,177
This woman with a grudge.

1179
01:40:13,693 --> 01:40:15,353
I don't know.

1180
01:40:17,780 --> 01:40:19,856
The dead don't talk.

1181
01:40:21,409 --> 01:40:22,654
At least not to me.

1182
01:40:45,099 --> 01:40:46,130
All right, thanks.

1183
01:41:12,167 --> 01:41:14,575
Hey, can I get Joey Mortell?

1184
01:41:18,924 --> 01:41:20,169
Crackheads.

1185
01:41:20,342 --> 01:41:24,256
<i>I got you stuck in traffic,
88th and 3rd Avenue.</i>

1186
01:41:24,429 --> 01:41:28,759
<i>Pull over at the corner, Roma 's Pizza.
Get yourself a slice.</i>

1187
01:41:28,934 --> 01:41:32,385
<i>- No, I'm not gonna be here that long.
- You are gonna be there that long...</i>

1188
01:41:32,562 --> 01:41:35,931
...because I got traffic backed up on 3rd
all the way to 96th Street.

1189
01:41:36,108 --> 01:41:39,607
<i>- Make yourself comfortable.
- I need you to do me a favor, okay?</i>

1190
01:41:39,986 --> 01:41:44,779
Can you run a trace on a call?
And I don't have a subpoena.

1191
01:41:44,950 --> 01:41:46,859
<i>But you'll get one, right?</i>

1192
01:41:47,536 --> 01:41:49,362
Yeah, if I have to.

1193
01:41:50,413 --> 01:41:51,789
All right.

1194
01:41:53,041 --> 01:41:55,034
Give me the date and the time.

1195
01:41:55,210 --> 01:41:57,368
<i>Two days ago, July 20th...</i>

1196
01:41:58,171 --> 01:42:00,413
<i>...between 12 and 1 :30 a.m.</i>

1197
01:42:00,590 --> 01:42:03,342
<i>All right. Okay, I need the number.</i>

1198
01:42:03,510 --> 01:42:04,755
Hold on.

1199
01:42:08,389 --> 01:42:11,141
<i>- It's 917...
- Yeah.</i>

1200
01:42:11,309 --> 01:42:16,220
<i>- ... 157- 1431.
- All right, give me the name.</i>

1201
01:42:16,397 --> 01:42:19,683
Look, it's private, like I said.

1202
01:42:19,859 --> 01:42:21,686
<i>Okay, it's that kind of private. I see.</i>

1203
01:42:21,861 --> 01:42:24,897
All right. Okay, yeah, I got you covered.

1204
01:42:25,073 --> 01:42:27,824
<i>- Okay, just call me, all right?
- You got it.</i>

1205
01:42:35,291 --> 01:42:36,536
You seen this ring before?

1206
01:42:38,169 --> 01:42:39,747
It looks familiar.

1207
01:42:50,139 --> 01:42:53,425
I got a name. Shauna Nelson.

1208
01:42:53,601 --> 01:42:55,475
An address, a cell phone.

1209
01:42:55,645 --> 01:42:57,304
What'd she look like?

1210
01:42:57,563 --> 01:43:02,190
She had two eyes, a mouth and a nose,
right in the middle of her face.

1211
01:43:02,735 --> 01:43:04,977
Please get the fuck out of here.

1212
01:43:20,210 --> 01:43:21,409
Yeah.

1213
01:43:27,676 --> 01:43:31,045
Shut up. Shut up. That is...

1214
01:43:32,765 --> 01:43:34,389
It's true.

1215
01:43:35,350 --> 01:43:36,726
Hello?

1216
01:43:37,728 --> 01:43:39,139
Hello?

1217
01:43:39,771 --> 01:43:41,230
- Do you know this number?
- No.

1218
01:43:41,398 --> 01:43:43,604
Are you sure? 917.

1219
01:43:43,775 --> 01:43:46,776
Hey, you guys, are 917... Fuck you guys.
I'll see you later, okay?

1220
01:43:46,945 --> 01:43:48,737
- Bye.
- Later.

1221
01:44:08,175 --> 01:44:09,550
Hey!

1222
01:44:12,429 --> 01:44:14,505
- Are you Shauna?
- Did you just call me?

1223
01:44:14,681 --> 01:44:18,513
Yeah, l... I got your number from
the pawn shop. You had my ring.

1224
01:44:20,562 --> 01:44:23,231
Yeah. Motherfucker fucks some slut...

1225
01:44:23,398 --> 01:44:25,687
...gives me the ring
as a fucking make-up gift.

1226
01:44:25,859 --> 01:44:28,729
- Turns out he stole the shit.
- I wanna know where he is.

1227
01:44:28,987 --> 01:44:30,944
Can you tell me where he is?

1228
01:44:32,782 --> 01:44:34,027
- L...
- No. No.

1229
01:44:34,200 --> 01:44:36,323
I need an address.
Phone number, anything.

1230
01:44:36,494 --> 01:44:39,032
- No. No!
- Tell me where he is!

1231
01:44:40,874 --> 01:44:42,866
I saw what they did to you.

1232
01:44:44,210 --> 01:44:46,416
That shit can't happen to me.

1233
01:44:48,965 --> 01:44:52,049
The call lasted
three minutes and 46 seconds.

1234
01:44:52,218 --> 01:44:54,709
<i>From 12:26 to 12:30...</i>

1235
01:44:54,887 --> 01:44:59,929
...from 917-157-1431
to your cell phone.

1236
01:45:00,518 --> 01:45:02,641
Vicinity of Roosevelt Island.

1237
01:45:03,896 --> 01:45:06,352
<i>Did she tell you she was someplace else?</i>

1238
01:45:06,983 --> 01:45:09,900
- Yes, she did.
- I'm sorry, man.

1239
01:45:10,069 --> 01:45:11,349
But fuck her, right?

1240
01:45:12,071 --> 01:45:14,479
<i>- Fuck her.
- Yup.</i>

1241
01:45:14,657 --> 01:45:16,317
Fuck her.

1242
01:45:16,492 --> 01:45:18,650
Hey, do me a favor.

1243
01:45:19,495 --> 01:45:21,701
Keep this to yourself until...

1244
01:45:21,872 --> 01:45:24,909
<i>...I can get that subpoena.
- Didn't even go on the hard drive.</i>

1245
01:45:48,691 --> 01:45:50,066
<i>Action!</i>

1246
01:45:52,194 --> 01:45:54,103
<i>Think you're fucking with me?!</i>

1247
01:46:05,123 --> 01:46:09,999
<i>Popped your motherfucking cherry!
Over there. Let's even shit out.</i>

1248
01:46:14,257 --> 01:46:15,538
<i>Heads up!</i>

1249
01:46:16,009 --> 01:46:17,717
<i>Hollywood!</i>

1250
01:46:20,472 --> 01:46:23,473
<i>How cute. Lovebirds.</i>

1251
01:47:04,098 --> 01:47:05,723
<i>Action!</i>

1252
01:47:07,602 --> 01:47:09,725
<i>Think you're fucking with me?!</i>

1253
01:48:23,469 --> 01:48:26,256
- You guys wanna make money or not?
- Hell, yeah.

1254
01:48:28,015 --> 01:48:30,932
You know what to do. Stand on
that corner and keep an eye out.

1255
01:48:31,101 --> 01:48:33,177
Show me you can do this.
Show me you're ready.

1256
01:48:33,353 --> 01:48:37,018
Stand next to the four guys, keep
your mouth shut and your eyes open.

1257
01:48:37,190 --> 01:48:38,601
Cops come, what do you do?

1258
01:48:38,775 --> 01:48:40,056
- Run!
- Run, right?

1259
01:49:19,816 --> 01:49:23,066
Good. Listen, motherfuckers, stand
on that sidewalk, keep an eye open.

1260
01:49:23,236 --> 01:49:25,644
- How hard can that shit be? Right?
- Yeah.

1261
01:49:25,822 --> 01:49:29,273
Good. So get going. Get on
that fucking sidewalk. Come on.

1262
01:49:40,628 --> 01:49:42,039
You want something?

1263
01:49:42,588 --> 01:49:43,964
I want my dog back.

1264
01:49:47,093 --> 01:49:48,124
The fuck?

1265
01:49:49,095 --> 01:49:51,550
Hi. Hi, boy. It's me.

1266
01:49:52,098 --> 01:49:54,767
Hey. Hey, buddy. Hey.

1267
01:49:54,934 --> 01:49:56,642
Do you remember me? Huh, boy?

1268
01:49:57,270 --> 01:49:58,598
Come on, man.

1269
01:50:00,815 --> 01:50:02,060
Go, go!

1270
01:50:02,400 --> 01:50:06,232
No, you got me fucking waiting,
and I need an address!

1271
01:50:06,404 --> 01:50:08,645
For Reed Bryant. He came in yesterday.

1272
01:50:36,141 --> 01:50:37,600
Get away, bitch!

1273
01:50:37,810 --> 01:50:39,055
Who's the bitch now?

1274
01:50:45,609 --> 01:50:48,182
<i>- 90 Clayton Avenue.
- Thank you.</i>

1275
01:51:19,726 --> 01:51:21,884
Get the fuck out of the road!

1276
01:51:57,388 --> 01:52:00,804
- Hey, puppy.
- Don't you know there's a leash law?

1277
01:52:03,019 --> 01:52:05,261
For a bitch like you!

1278
01:52:06,397 --> 01:52:09,019
It's just you and me
and the fucking dog again, bitch!

1279
01:52:09,192 --> 01:52:12,477
I made your boyfriend smile.
I'm gonna make you smile too, bitch!

1280
01:52:12,653 --> 01:52:15,738
- You think you can come after me, huh?
- Get on the ground!

1281
01:52:15,907 --> 01:52:19,821
Get on the fucking ground! Police!
On the ground! Lay flat on the ground!

1282
01:52:19,994 --> 01:52:22,070
- Drop the gun, Erica!
- Stay out of this!

1283
01:52:22,246 --> 01:52:23,954
- No.
- This is between him and me!

1284
01:52:24,123 --> 01:52:26,614
- You do not have the right.
- Yes, I do!

1285
01:52:26,792 --> 01:52:29,497
No. I have the right
to hunt him down and to shoot him.

1286
01:52:29,670 --> 01:52:30,701
Then shoot him, then!

1287
01:52:30,880 --> 01:52:33,667
I don't do that shit, I investigate it.
Now give me the gun.

1288
01:52:33,841 --> 01:52:36,249
- And what are you gonna do, Mercer?
- Come on.

1289
01:52:37,178 --> 01:52:39,004
- You gonna arrest him?
- Give me the gun.

1290
01:52:39,180 --> 01:52:40,757
- Arrest me, officer!
- Shut up!

1291
01:52:40,931 --> 01:52:42,556
- Give me the gun!
- Come on, cuff me!

1292
01:52:42,725 --> 01:52:45,560
- Shut up!
- Give me the gun, I said.

1293
01:52:46,478 --> 01:52:48,685
Come on. Good girl.

1294
01:52:49,231 --> 01:52:51,307
That's it. Good girl.

1295
01:52:53,277 --> 01:52:54,652
No.

1296
01:53:02,453 --> 01:53:07,328
Now, if you're gonna use a gun,
you make sure it's legal.

1297
01:53:07,499 --> 01:53:09,408
What the fuck are you doing, man?

1298
01:53:09,585 --> 01:53:11,411
- Ain't nobody talking to you.
- Come on...

1299
01:53:11,587 --> 01:53:13,994
- I saw that shit you did!
- You're a fucking cop!

1300
01:53:14,214 --> 01:53:15,245
- Not tonight.
- Come on!

1301
01:53:15,465 --> 01:53:18,751
- Put me in cuffs! Get me out of here!
- Shut the fuck up!

1302
01:53:40,031 --> 01:53:41,989
You can take me now.

1303
01:53:44,077 --> 01:53:47,778
Problem is, if you go down,
I go down.

1304
01:53:47,956 --> 01:53:51,823
No. I can't let you do that for me.

1305
01:54:02,971 --> 01:54:06,174
So you've got one person left to shoot.

1306
01:54:07,517 --> 01:54:09,011
What?

1307
01:54:09,185 --> 01:54:12,850
You see, there was never any vigilante.

1308
01:54:13,022 --> 01:54:16,771
It was just three punks
out on a killing spree.

1309
01:54:18,361 --> 01:54:21,611
They got a taste for it up in Central Park.

1310
01:54:23,116 --> 01:54:25,785
And they bought themselves a gun.

1311
01:54:27,954 --> 01:54:32,366
And they turned on each other,
the way they do.

1312
01:54:32,542 --> 01:54:34,534
And somehow...

1313
01:54:34,710 --> 01:54:36,869
...I got winged and...

1314
01:54:37,839 --> 01:54:39,381
...I did what I had to do.

1315
01:54:42,051 --> 01:54:43,711
Right here.

1316
01:54:47,181 --> 01:54:50,217
- I can't.
- You only shoot bad guys?

1317
01:54:51,060 --> 01:54:55,686
I've joined that club. Now you nick me,
graze me, but you wound me.

1318
01:55:00,027 --> 01:55:01,901
From about 3 feet.

1319
01:55:09,245 --> 01:55:12,779
- My hands are shaking.
- You just make sure you miss my heart.

1320
01:55:21,340 --> 01:55:24,424
Damn! Motherfucker, that shit hurts!

1321
01:55:24,593 --> 01:55:26,420
I'm sorry.

1322
01:55:26,929 --> 01:55:28,720
I'm sorry.

1323
01:55:29,098 --> 01:55:30,841
So am I.

1324
01:55:31,016 --> 01:55:34,930
Now you get out of here
before I lose my temper.

1325
01:56:27,489 --> 01:56:30,193
Baby, look at you.
She left you too, huh?

1326
01:56:31,367 --> 01:56:35,151
That's okay. I got you now.
You're gonna be fine. Come here.

1327
01:56:35,330 --> 01:56:37,488
Come here. Wait, wait, wait!

1328
01:56:51,054 --> 01:56:54,636
10-13, 10-13. Officer hit.

1329
01:56:54,807 --> 01:56:58,675
Three perps down at 90 Clayton.

1330
01:57:00,188 --> 01:57:02,061
Send a bus.

1331
01:57:46,233 --> 01:57:51,228
<i>There is no going back
to that other person...</i>

1332
01:57:52,072 --> 01:57:54,112
<i>... that other place.</i>

1333
01:57:54,491 --> 01:57:58,738
<i>This thing, this stranger...</i>

1334
01:57:59,663 --> 01:58:02,580
<i>... she is all you are now.</i>

Come on, Sven.

32
00:03:42,254 --> 00:03:44,222
Elsa. Psst!

33
00:03:46,092 --> 00:03:47,559
Elsa!

34
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:50,028
Wake up. Wake up.
Wake up!

35
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:52,897
Anna, go back to sleep.

36
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:54,933
I just can't.

37
00:03:54,935 --> 00:03:58,403
The sky is awake,
so I'm awake.

38
00:03:58,405 --> 00:04:00,338
So, we have to play.

39
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:02,440
Go play by yourself.

40
00:04:08,782 --> 00:04:11,983
Do you want to
build a snowman?

41
00:04:12,485 --> 00:04:15,854
Come on, come on,
come on!

42
00:04:18,825 --> 00:04:20,125
Do the magic!

43
00:04:20,327 --> 00:04:22,360
Do the magic!

44
00:04:25,564 --> 00:04:26,931
Oh...

45
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:29,667
Ready?
Uh-huh.

46
00:04:32,505 --> 00:04:34,706
This is amazing!

47
00:04:37,077 --> 00:04:38,910
Watch this!

48
00:04:46,952 --> 00:04:48,253
Hi, I'm Olaf,

49
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:49,921
and I like warm hugs.

50
00:04:49,923 --> 00:04:52,190
I love you, Olaf!

51
00:04:55,194 --> 00:04:57,629
Olaf...

52
00:04:58,531 --> 00:04:59,998
Tickle bumps!

53
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,566
Oh!

54
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:05,069
Hang on!

55
00:05:05,071 --> 00:05:06,237
Catch me!

56
00:05:06,239 --> 00:05:07,472
Gotcha!

57
00:05:07,474 --> 00:05:08,940
Again!

58
00:05:08,942 --> 00:05:10,241
Wait!

59
00:05:10,243 --> 00:05:12,210
Whoo-hoo!
Slow down!

60
00:05:14,014 --> 00:05:15,013
Whoo!

61
00:05:15,015 --> 00:05:16,748
Anna!

62
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,121
Anna!

63
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:27,759
Mama! Papa!

64
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:30,929
No, no...

65
00:05:35,467 --> 00:05:38,136
You're okay, Anna.
I got you.

66
00:05:38,138 --> 00:05:41,072
Elsa, what have
you done?

67
00:05:41,074 --> 00:05:42,807
This is getting
out of hand.

68
00:05:42,809 --> 00:05:46,177
It was an accident.
I'm sorry, Anna!

69
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:50,081
Oh. She's ice cold.
I know where we have to go.

70
00:06:10,669 --> 00:06:12,036
Ice?

71
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:16,407
Faster, Sven.

72
00:06:16,409 --> 00:06:17,876
Sven!

73
00:06:20,513 --> 00:06:24,816
Please! Help!
It's my daughter.

74
00:06:35,661 --> 00:06:36,895
It's the king.

75
00:06:39,632 --> 00:06:41,466
- Trolls?
- Shush!

76
00:06:41,468 --> 00:06:43,568
I'm trying to listen.

77
00:06:44,203 --> 00:06:47,672
Cuties.
I'm going to keep you.

78
00:06:48,107 --> 00:06:49,340
Your Majesty.

79
00:06:49,342 --> 00:06:51,042
Born with the powers,
or cursed?

80
00:06:51,044 --> 00:06:54,679
Born.
And they're getting stronger.

81
00:06:55,214 --> 00:06:57,181
Here, here.

82
00:06:57,316 --> 00:06:59,651
You are lucky
it wasn't her heart.

83
00:06:59,653 --> 00:07:02,820
The heart is not
so easily changed.

84
00:07:02,822 --> 00:07:05,957
But the head
can be persuaded.

85
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:07,258
Do what you must.

86
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:10,194
I recommend
we remove all magic.

87
00:07:10,196 --> 00:07:14,532
Even memories of magic,
to be safe.

88
00:07:15,301 --> 00:07:19,504
But don't worry.
I'll leave the fun.

89
00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:25,476
She will be okay.

90
00:07:25,478 --> 00:07:28,479
But she won't remember
I have powers?

91
00:07:28,481 --> 00:07:29,747
It's for the best.

92
00:07:29,749 --> 00:07:34,986
Listen to me, Elsa.
Your power will only grow.

93
00:07:35,454 --> 00:07:38,856
There is beauty in it...

94
00:07:39,491 --> 00:07:41,325
But also great danger.

95
00:07:42,027 --> 00:07:44,562
You must learn to control it.

96
00:07:44,896 --> 00:07:48,032
Fear will be your enemy.

97
00:07:49,903 --> 00:07:50,835
No!

98
00:07:50,837 --> 00:07:51,836
We'll protect her.

99
00:07:51,838 --> 00:07:54,706
She can learn to control it.
I'm sure.

100
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:56,107
<i>Until then...</i>

101
00:07:56,109 --> 00:07:58,276
<i>We'll lock the gates.</i>

102
00:07:58,278 --> 00:07:59,344
<i>We'll reduce the staff.</i>

103
00:07:59,346 --> 00:08:02,513
<i>We will limit her contact
with people,</i>

104
00:08:02,515 --> 00:08:06,718
<i>and keep her powers
hidden from everyone.</i>

105
00:08:08,754 --> 00:08:10,855
<i>Including Anna.</i>

106
00:08:19,031 --> 00:08:21,199
Ah.

107
00:08:21,467 --> 00:08:22,867
Elsa?

108
00:08:24,637 --> 00:08:28,272
<i># Do you wanna build
a snowman?</i>

109
00:08:28,274 --> 00:08:31,342
<i># Come on,
let's go and play</i>

110
00:08:31,777 --> 00:08:33,878
<i># I never see
you anymore</i>

111
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,079
<i># Come out the door</i>

112
00:08:35,081 --> 00:08:37,582
<i># It's like
you've gone away</i>

113
00:08:37,584 --> 00:08:42,286
<i># We used to be best buddies
And now we're not</i>

114
00:08:42,288 --> 00:08:45,923
<i># I wish you
would tell me why</i>

115
00:08:45,925 --> 00:08:48,693
<i># Do you wanna build
a snowman?</i>

116
00:08:48,695 --> 00:08:51,963
<i># It doesn't
have to be a snowman</i>

117
00:08:51,965 --> 00:08:53,898
Go away, Anna.

118
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:57,235
<i># Okay, bye #</i>

119
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,509
The gloves will help.

120
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:06,677
See?
Conceal it.

121
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:08,246
Don't feel it.

122
00:09:08,248 --> 00:09:10,314
Don't let it show.

123
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:14,986
<i># Do you wanna
build a snowman?</i>

124
00:09:14,988 --> 00:09:18,089
<i># Or ride our bike
around the halls?</i>

125
00:09:18,725 --> 00:09:20,391
<i># I think some company
is overdue</i>

126
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:24,228
<i># I've started talking
To the pictures on the walls</i>

127
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:24,962
Hang in there, Joan.

128
00:09:24,964 --> 00:09:28,399
<i># It gets a little lonely
All these empty rooms</i>

129
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:32,403
<i># Just watching
the hours tick by #</i>

130
00:09:37,976 --> 00:09:39,243
I'm scared.

131
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:39,944
It's getting stronger!

132
00:09:39,946 --> 00:09:43,047
Getting upset only makes
it worse. Calm down.

133
00:09:43,049 --> 00:09:44,749
No! Don't touch me!

134
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:47,685
Please,
I don't want to hurt you.

135
00:09:54,994 --> 00:09:57,395
See you in two weeks!

136
00:09:58,964 --> 00:10:00,465
Do you have to go?

137
00:10:00,467 --> 00:10:03,067
You'll be fine, Elsa.

138
00:10:04,002 --> 00:10:06,003
Your Highness.

139
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:43,207
Elsa?

140
00:10:43,209 --> 00:10:46,544
<i># Please
I know you're in there</i>

141
00:10:46,546 --> 00:10:50,148
<i># People are asking
where you've been</i>

142
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:54,685
<i># They say "Have courage"
And I'm trying to</i>

143
00:10:54,687 --> 00:10:56,954
<i># I'm right out here for you</i>

144
00:10:56,956 --> 00:10:59,524
<i># Just let me in</i>

145
00:10:59,526 --> 00:11:04,662
<i># We only have each other
It's just you and me</i>

146
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:09,233
<i># What are we gonna do?</i>

147
00:11:12,271 --> 00:11:15,973
<i># Do you wanna build
a snowman? #</i>

148
00:11:49,474 --> 00:11:51,141
All ashore!

149
00:11:51,543 --> 00:11:54,011
Welcome to Arendelle!

150
00:11:54,013 --> 00:11:55,479
Watch your step, please.

151
00:11:55,481 --> 00:11:56,981
The gates will be
opening soon.

152
00:11:56,983 --> 00:11:58,783
Why do I have to
wear this?

153
00:11:58,785 --> 00:12:01,285
Because the queen
has come of age.

154
00:12:01,287 --> 00:12:02,987
It's Coronation Day!

155
00:12:02,989 --> 00:12:05,389
That's not my fault.

156
00:12:11,129 --> 00:12:13,331
What do you want, Sven?

157
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:14,732
"Give me a snack".

158
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:16,667
What's the magic word?

159
00:12:16,669 --> 00:12:17,501
"Please".

160
00:12:17,503 --> 00:12:19,971
Uh! Uh-uh-uh.
Share.

161
00:12:20,105 --> 00:12:23,306
I can't believe they're
finally opening up the gates!

162
00:12:23,308 --> 00:12:27,044
- And for a whole day!
-  Faster, Percy!

163
00:12:27,446 --> 00:12:33,050
Arendelle, our most
mysterious trade partner.

164
00:12:33,052 --> 00:12:38,218
Open those gates
so I may unlock your secrets
and exploit your riches.

165
00:12:38,289 --> 00:12:39,222
Did I say that out loud?

166
00:12:39,224 --> 00:12:42,658
Oh! Me sore eyes
can't wait to see the queen
and the princess.

167
00:12:42,661 --> 00:12:44,829
I bet they are
absolutely lovely.

168
00:12:44,831 --> 00:12:47,665
I bet they are beautiful.

169
00:12:52,237 --> 00:12:53,837
Princess Anna?

170
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:56,340
- Princess Anna?
- Huh?  Yeah?

171
00:12:56,342 --> 00:12:57,975
Oh. Sorry to wake you,
ma'am.

172
00:12:57,977 --> 00:12:59,344
No, no, no, you didn't.

173
00:12:59,446 --> 00:13:02,346
I've been up for hours.

174
00:13:05,717 --> 00:13:06,984
Who is it?

175
00:13:06,986 --> 00:13:08,519
Still me, ma'am.

176
00:13:08,521 --> 00:13:11,589
The gates will open soon.
Time to get ready.

177
00:13:11,591 --> 00:13:13,958
Of course.

178
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:14,959
Ready for what?

179
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:17,695
Your sister's coronation, ma'am.

180
00:13:17,697 --> 00:13:20,731
My sister's corneration.

181
00:13:22,567 --> 00:13:25,036
It's Coronation Day!

182
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:29,640
It's Coronation Day!

183
00:13:30,108 --> 00:13:31,375
<i># The window is open!</i>

184
00:13:31,377 --> 00:13:32,109
<i># So's that door!</i>

185
00:13:32,111 --> 00:13:34,145
<i># I didn't know
they did that anymore</i>

186
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:39,183
<i># Who knew we owned
8,000 salad plates?</i>

187
00:13:39,185 --> 00:13:41,652
<i># For years I've roamed
these empty halls</i>

188
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:44,255
<i># Why have a ballroom
with no balls?</i>

189
00:13:44,257 --> 00:13:48,526
<i># Finally
They're opening up the gates!</i>

190
00:13:48,528 --> 00:13:51,562
<i># There'll be actual,
real, live people</i>

191
00:13:51,564 --> 00:13:53,431
<i># It'll be totally strange</i>

192
00:13:53,433 --> 00:13:57,401
<i># But wow!
Am I so ready for this change!</i>

193
00:13:57,403 --> 00:14:02,740
<i># 'Cause for the first time
in forever</i>

194
00:14:02,742 --> 00:14:04,342
<i># There'll be music</i>

195
00:14:04,344 --> 00:14:07,278
<i># There'll be light</i>

196
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:09,680
<i># For the first time</i>

197
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:11,716
<i># In forever</i>

198
00:14:11,718 --> 00:14:16,554
<i># I'll be dancing
through the night</i>

199
00:14:16,556 --> 00:14:18,389
<i># Don't know
if I'm elated or gassy</i>

200
00:14:18,391 --> 00:14:21,525
<i># But I'm somewhere
in that zone</i>

201
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:27,465
<i># 'Cause for the first time

202
00:14:28,834 --> 00:14:30,401
<i># I won't be alone</i>

203
00:14:30,403 --> 00:14:33,637
I can't wait to meet everyone!

204
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:36,107
What if I meet The One?

205
00:14:36,109 --> 00:14:38,676
<i># Tonight
Imagine me gown and all</i>

206
00:14:38,678 --> 00:14:41,212
<i># Fetchingly draped
against the wall</i>

207
00:14:41,214 --> 00:14:45,716
<i># The picture
of sophisticated grace</i>

208
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:48,586
<i># I suddenly see him
standing there</i>

209
00:14:48,588 --> 00:14:49,854
<i># A beautiful stranger</i>

210
00:14:49,856 --> 00:14:50,621
<i># Tall and fair</i>

211
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:55,059
<i># I wanna stuff
some chocolate in my face!</i>

212
00:14:55,061 --> 00:14:58,129
<i># But then we laugh
and talk all evening</i>

213
00:14:58,131 --> 00:15:00,197
<i># Which is totally bizarre</i>

214
00:15:00,199 --> 00:15:04,502
<i># Nothing like the life
I've led so far</i>

215
00:15:04,504 --> 00:15:08,739
<i># For the first time
in forever</i>

216
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:13,444
<i># There'll be magic
There'll be fun</i>

217
00:15:13,446 --> 00:15:18,082
<i># For the first time
in forever</i>

218
00:15:18,084 --> 00:15:22,653
<i># I could be noticed
by someone</i>

219
00:15:22,655 --> 00:15:25,656
<i># And I know
it is totally crazy</i>

220
00:15:25,658 --> 00:15:28,492
<i># To dream I'd find romance</i>

221
00:15:28,494 --> 00:15:33,831
<i># But for the first time
in forever</i>

222
00:15:34,533 --> 00:15:37,935
<i># At least
I've got a chance! #</i>

223
00:15:43,843 --> 00:15:46,110
<i># Don't let them in</i>

224
00:15:46,112 --> 00:15:48,612
<i># Don't let them see</i>

225
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:50,114
<i># Be the good girl</i>

226
00:15:50,116 --> 00:15:52,383
<i># You always have to be</i>

227
00:15:54,019 --> 00:15:55,686
<i># Conceal</i>

228
00:15:55,688 --> 00:15:57,521
<i># Don't feel</i>

229
00:15:57,523 --> 00:15:59,757
<i># Put on a show</i>

230
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:01,125
<i># Make one wrong move</i>

231
00:16:01,127 --> 00:16:04,328
<i># And everyone will know</i>

232
00:16:05,096 --> 00:16:06,597
<i># But it's only for today</i>

233
00:16:06,599 --> 00:16:07,665
<i># It's only for today</i>

234
00:16:07,667 --> 00:16:08,732
<i># It's agony to wait</i>

235
00:16:08,834 --> 00:16:10,634
<i># It's agony to wait</i>

236
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:14,138
<i># Tell the guards to open up</i>

237
00:16:14,206 --> 00:16:16,807
<i># The gate</i>

238
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:18,509
<i># The gate</i>

239
00:16:18,511 --> 00:16:21,545
<i># For the first time
in forever</i>

240
00:16:21,547 --> 00:16:23,113
<i># Don't let them in
Don't let them see</i>

241
00:16:23,115 --> 00:16:27,351
<i># I'm getting
what I'm dreaming of</i>

242
00:16:27,353 --> 00:16:28,486
<i># Be the good girl</i>

243
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:29,753
<i># You always have to be</i>

244
00:16:29,755 --> 00:16:31,355
<i># A chance to change</i>

245
00:16:31,357 --> 00:16:33,190
<i># My lonely world</i>

246
00:16:33,192 --> 00:16:34,191
<i># Conceal</i>

247
00:16:34,193 --> 00:16:37,061
<i># A chance
to find true love</i>

248
00:16:37,063 --> 00:16:39,663
<i># Conceal, don't feel
Don't let them know</i>

249
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:41,966
<i># I know it all ends tomorrow</i>

250
00:16:41,968 --> 00:16:44,468
<i># So it has to be today!</i>

251
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:50,341
<i># 'Cause for the first time

252
00:16:50,343 --> 00:16:52,843
<i># For the first time</i>

253
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:56,814
<i># In forever</i>

254
00:16:57,182 --> 00:17:01,785
<i># Nothing's in my way! #</i>

255
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:07,925
Hey!

256
00:17:07,927 --> 00:17:10,094
I'm so sorry.
Are you hurt?

257
00:17:10,395 --> 00:17:11,762
Hey.

258
00:17:11,764 --> 00:17:14,064
Uh...
No, no, I'm okay.

259
00:17:14,066 --> 00:17:14,698
Are you sure?

260
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:17,968
Yeah. I just wasn't
looking where I was going.

261
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:20,538
But I'm great, actually.

262
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:22,973
Oh... Thank goodness.

263
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:27,077
Oh! Uh...

264
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:29,446
Prince Hans of the
Southern Isles.

265
00:17:29,448 --> 00:17:31,749
Princess Anna of Arendelle.

266
00:17:31,751 --> 00:17:33,917
- "Princess"? My Lady.
- Oh!

267
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:36,153
Whoa.
Whoa, whoa, whoa...

268
00:17:36,155 --> 00:17:38,022
Um...
Whew.

269
00:17:38,124 --> 00:17:39,256
Hi. Again.

270
00:17:40,058 --> 00:17:41,692
Oh, boy!

271
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:42,626
This is awkward.

272
00:17:42,628 --> 00:17:44,761
Not "You're awkward",
but just because we're...

273
00:17:44,763 --> 00:17:47,397
I'm awkward, you're gorgeous.
Wait, what?

274
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:51,098
I'd like to formally
apologize for hitting the princess
of Arendelle with my horse.

275
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:53,237
And for every moment after.

276
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:54,805
No! No, no.
It's fine.

277
00:17:54,807 --> 00:17:55,873
I'm not that princess.

278
00:17:55,875 --> 00:17:57,474
I mean, if you
had hit my sister Elsa,

279
00:17:57,476 --> 00:17:59,710
it would be...
Yeesh!

280
00:17:59,712 --> 00:18:01,245
Because, you know...

281
00:18:01,247 --> 00:18:02,846
Hello.

282
00:18:02,848 --> 00:18:04,348
But, lucky you,

283
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:06,917
it's just me.

284
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:08,552
"Just" you?

285
00:18:15,327 --> 00:18:17,261
The bells.
The coronation.

286
00:18:17,263 --> 00:18:18,963
I better go.

287
00:18:18,965 --> 00:18:22,300
I have to go.
I better go. Uh...

288
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:24,268
Bye!

289
00:18:25,704 --> 00:18:27,571
Oh, no. Oh!

290
00:19:09,448 --> 00:19:12,382
Your Majesty,
the gloves.

291
00:19:42,481 --> 00:19:45,282
Queen Elsa of Arendelle.

292
00:19:45,584 --> 00:19:48,619
Queen Elsa of Arendelle!

293
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:09,206
Queen Elsa of Arendelle.

294
00:20:10,175 --> 00:20:13,777
Princess Anna of Arendelle.

295
00:20:18,317 --> 00:20:19,849
Oh. Here?
Are you sure?

296
00:20:19,851 --> 00:20:22,818
Because I don't think
I'm supposed to... Oh. Okay.

297
00:20:31,397 --> 00:20:32,796
Hi.

298
00:20:32,798 --> 00:20:34,732
"Hi" me? Oh...

299
00:20:34,734 --> 00:20:36,467
Um... Hi.

300
00:20:38,002 --> 00:20:39,369
You look beautiful.

301
00:20:39,371 --> 00:20:41,638
Thank you.
You look beautiful-ler.

302
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,473
I mean, not "fuller".
You don't look fuller.

303
00:20:43,475 --> 00:20:44,908
But more beautiful.

304
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,610
Thank you.

305
00:20:47,445 --> 00:20:48,378
So...

306
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:51,081
This is what
a party looks like.

307
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:53,517
It's warmer
than I thought.

308
00:20:53,519 --> 00:20:55,786
What is that
amazing smell?

309
00:20:56,956 --> 00:20:59,157
Chocolate.

310
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:04,828
Your Majesty.

311
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:08,098
The Duke of Weaseltown.
"Weselton"!

312
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,267
Duke of Weselton,
Your Majesty.

313
00:21:10,469 --> 00:21:12,804
As your closest
partner in trade...

314
00:21:12,806 --> 00:21:16,538
it seems only fitting that I offer you
your first dance as queen.

315
00:21:16,709 --> 00:21:18,809
One-two, and jump.

316
00:21:22,647 --> 00:21:23,580
Uh...

317
00:21:23,582 --> 00:21:26,150
Thank you.
Only, I don't dance.

318
00:21:26,152 --> 00:21:27,084
Oh...

319
00:21:27,086 --> 00:21:29,286
But my sister does.

320
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:30,521
- What?
- Oh! Lucky you.

321
00:21:30,523 --> 00:21:31,721
Oh, I don't think...

322
00:21:31,723 --> 00:21:34,491
If you swoon,
let me know. I'll catch you.

323
00:21:34,526 --> 00:21:35,659
Sorry.

324
00:21:36,061 --> 00:21:37,661
Like an agile peacock.

325
00:21:37,663 --> 00:21:39,463
Ow! Ow.

326
00:21:39,465 --> 00:21:42,499
Speaking of, so great
to have the gates open.

327
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:45,368
Why did they shut them
in the first place?

328
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:47,938
Do you know
the reason? Hmm?

329
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:49,272
- No.
- No.

330
00:21:49,274 --> 00:21:51,375
All right.
Hang on!

331
00:21:51,377 --> 00:21:54,044
They don't call me
the "Little Dipper" for nothing!

332
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:54,878
Oh-ho!

333
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:59,016
Like a chicken with the face
of a monkey, I fly.

334
00:21:59,018 --> 00:22:00,250
Your Majesty.

335
00:22:00,252 --> 00:22:01,618
Let me know when you're ready

336
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:02,686
for another round, Milady.

337
00:22:02,688 --> 00:22:06,089
Well, he was sprightly.

338
00:22:06,091 --> 00:22:08,191
Especially
for a man in heels.

339
00:22:08,253 --> 00:22:09,627
Are you okay?

340
00:22:10,129 --> 00:22:14,331
I've never been better.
This is so nice.

341
00:22:14,532 --> 00:22:17,268
I wish it could be
like this all the time.

342
00:22:17,602 --> 00:22:19,603
Me, too.

343
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:23,640
But it can't.

344
00:22:23,642 --> 00:22:26,743
- Why not?
- It just can't.

345
00:22:31,116 --> 00:22:33,417
Excuse me
for a minute.

346
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:40,891
I'd be honored.

347
00:22:41,927 --> 00:22:43,427
Glad I caught you.

348
00:22:43,429 --> 00:22:44,961
Hans.

349
00:22:44,963 --> 00:22:47,030
Oop.

350
00:22:54,172 --> 00:22:56,773
I often had a whole parlor
to myself to slide!

351
00:22:56,775 --> 00:22:58,775
Oh!
Oops!

352
00:22:58,777 --> 00:23:00,043
Sorry.

353
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:01,678
Your physique helps,
I'm sure, too.

354
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,647
Ah.

355
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,352
What's this?

356
00:23:08,354 --> 00:23:09,553
Uh, I was born with it.

357
00:23:09,555 --> 00:23:12,456
Although, I dreamed
I was kissed by a troll.

358
00:23:12,458 --> 00:23:13,524
I like it.

359
00:23:13,726 --> 00:23:15,592
Yeah, the whole thing.

360
00:23:15,594 --> 00:23:16,226
You got it.

361
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:19,763
Okay, wait, wait.
So, you have how many brothers?

362
00:23:19,765 --> 00:23:21,698
Twelve older brothers.

363
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:24,401
Three of them
pretended I was invisible,

364
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:26,436
literally, for two years.

365
00:23:26,438 --> 00:23:27,938
That's horrible.

366
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:29,640
It's what brothers do.

367
00:23:29,642 --> 00:23:30,641
And sisters.

368
00:23:30,943 --> 00:23:33,643
Elsa and I were really close
when we were little.

369
00:23:33,645 --> 00:23:37,980
But then, one day,
she just shut me out, and

370
00:23:38,382 --> 00:23:40,383
and I never knew why.

371
00:23:40,385 --> 00:23:42,786
I would never
shut you out.

372
00:23:44,323 --> 00:23:47,558
Okay, can I just say
something crazy?

373
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:48,492
I love crazy.

374
00:23:48,694 --> 00:23:53,663
<i># All my life has been
A series of doors in my face</i>

375
00:23:53,665 --> 00:23:56,699
<i># And then suddenly
I bump into you</i>

376
00:23:56,701 --> 00:23:58,835
I was thinking the same thing,
because, like...

377
00:23:58,837 --> 00:24:01,471
<i># I've been searching
my whole life</i>

378
00:24:01,473 --> 00:24:03,373
<i># To find my own place</i>

379
00:24:03,375 --> 00:24:05,909
<i># And maybe
it's the party talking</i>

380
00:24:05,911 --> 00:24:08,178
<i># Or the chocolate fondue</i>

381
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:09,145
<i># But with you</i>

382
00:24:09,147 --> 00:24:11,848
<i># But with you
I found my place</i>

383
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:12,749
<i># I see your face</i>

384
00:24:12,751 --> 00:24:17,154
<i># And it's nothing like
I've ever known before</i>

385
00:24:17,156 --> 00:24:19,822
<i># Love is an open door</i>

386
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:23,060
<i># Love is an open</i>

387
00:24:23,062 --> 00:24:26,229
<i># Door

388
00:24:26,231 --> 00:24:28,365

391
00:24:31,370 --> 00:24:34,205
<i># Love is an open door</i>

392
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:43,312
<i># I mean, it's crazy
# What?</i>

393
00:24:43,314 --> 00:24:45,515
<i># We finish each other's
# Sandwiches</i>

394
00:24:45,517 --> 00:24:46,883
That's what I
was gonna say!

395
00:24:46,885 --> 00:24:48,017
<i># I've never met someone</i>

396
00:24:48,019 --> 00:24:49,953
<i># Who thinks
so much like me</i>

397
00:24:49,955 --> 00:24:51,521
Jinx! Jinx again!

398
00:24:51,623 --> 00:24:56,593
<i># Our mental synchronization
Can have but one explanation</i>

399
00:24:56,595 --> 00:24:57,694
<i># You
# And I</i>

400
00:24:57,696 --> 00:25:00,162
<i># Were
# Just meant to be</i>

401
00:25:00,299 --> 00:25:02,432
<i># Say goodbye
# Say goodbye</i>

402
00:25:02,434 --> 00:25:05,735
<i># To the pain
of the past</i>

403
00:25:05,737 --> 00:25:09,873
<i># We don't have
to feel it anymore</i>

404
00:25:09,875 --> 00:25:14,411
<i># Love is an open door</i>

405
00:25:14,779 --> 00:25:16,213
<i># Love is an open</i>

<i># Door

412
00:25:29,328 --> 00:25:31,628
Can I say something crazy?

413
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:33,730
Will you marry me?

414
00:25:33,732 --> 00:25:36,233
Can I say something
even crazier?

415
00:25:36,301 --> 00:25:37,768
Yes!

416
00:25:40,371 --> 00:25:42,706
- Coming through.
- Excuse me. Oh...

417
00:25:42,708 --> 00:25:44,474
- Pardon. Sorry.
- Oh!

418
00:25:44,476 --> 00:25:46,643
Can we just get
around you there?

419
00:25:46,645 --> 00:25:48,945
Thank you.
Oh! There she is.

420
00:25:48,947 --> 00:25:49,513
Elsa!

421
00:25:49,515 --> 00:25:52,149
I mean, Queen.
Me again. Um...

422
00:25:52,151 --> 00:25:56,686
May I present Prince Hans
of the Southern Isles.

423
00:25:56,688 --> 00:25:58,655
Your Majesty.

424
00:25:58,657 --> 00:25:59,456
We would like...

425
00:25:59,458 --> 00:26:02,325
Uh, your blessing...

426
00:26:02,327 --> 00:26:04,461
Of our marriage.

427
00:26:04,463 --> 00:26:06,596
- Marriage?
- Yes!

428
00:26:06,598 --> 00:26:07,864
I'm sorry,
I'm confused.

429
00:26:07,866 --> 00:26:10,299
Well, we haven't worked out
all the details ourselves.

430
00:26:10,301 --> 00:26:12,001
We'll need a few days
to plan the ceremony.

431
00:26:12,003 --> 00:26:14,471
Of course, we'll have soup, roast
and ice cream. And then...

432
00:26:14,473 --> 00:26:16,239
Wait. Would we live here?

433
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:17,974
- Here?
- Absolutely!

434
00:26:17,976 --> 00:26:18,808
- Anna!
- Oh!

435
00:26:18,810 --> 00:26:21,077
We can invite all 12 of your
brothers to stay with us.

436
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:22,278
What? No, no, no.

437
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:24,514
- Of course we have the room.
- Wait, slow down.

438
00:26:24,516 --> 00:26:26,383
No one's brothers
are staying here.

439
00:26:26,385 --> 00:26:28,351
No one is getting married.

440
00:26:28,353 --> 00:26:29,052
Wait, what?

441
00:26:29,054 --> 00:26:32,555
May I talk to you, please?
Alone.

442
00:26:32,857 --> 00:26:36,927
No. Whatever you have to say,
you can say to both of us.

443
00:26:36,929 --> 00:26:40,430
Fine. You can't marry
a man you just met.

444
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:42,165
You can if it's true love.

445
00:26:42,167 --> 00:26:44,201
Anna, what do you know
about true love?

446
00:26:44,203 --> 00:26:45,368
More than you.

447
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:47,871
All you know is how
to shut people out.

448
00:26:48,574 --> 00:26:52,709
You asked for my blessing,
but my answer is no.

449
00:26:52,711 --> 00:26:54,411
Now, excuse me.

450
00:26:54,413 --> 00:26:55,645
Your Majesty,
if I may ease your...

451
00:26:55,647 --> 00:26:59,015
No, you may not.
And I think you should go.

452
00:26:59,017 --> 00:27:00,750
The party is over.
Close the gates.

453
00:27:00,752 --> 00:27:01,952
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- What?

454
00:27:01,954 --> 00:27:03,853
Elsa, no, no!
Wait.

455
00:27:03,855 --> 00:27:05,021
Give me my glove!

456
00:27:05,023 --> 00:27:06,289
Elsa, please, please.

457
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:09,192
I can't live
like this anymore!

458
00:27:10,528 --> 00:27:12,395
Then leave.

459
00:27:16,968 --> 00:27:18,902
What did I ever
do to you?

460
00:27:18,904 --> 00:27:19,903
Enough, Anna.

461
00:27:19,905 --> 00:27:22,239
No, why?
Why do you shut me out?

462
00:27:22,241 --> 00:27:23,873
Why do you shut
the world out?

463
00:27:23,875 --> 00:27:26,076
What are you
so afraid of?

464
00:27:26,078 --> 00:27:28,211
I said, enough!

465
00:27:36,187 --> 00:27:36,886
Sorcery.

466
00:27:36,888 --> 00:27:40,824
I knew there was something
dubious going on here.

467
00:27:41,058 --> 00:27:42,792
Elsa.

468
00:27:49,367 --> 00:27:51,034
There she is!

469
00:27:56,241 --> 00:27:58,508
Yes! It is her!

470
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:00,243
Queen Elsa.

471
00:28:00,578 --> 00:28:02,145
Our beautiful queen!

472
00:28:02,147 --> 00:28:05,482
Your Majesty?
Are you all right?

473
00:28:06,317 --> 00:28:07,817
No.

474
00:28:16,862 --> 00:28:17,927
There she is!
Stop her!

475
00:28:17,929 --> 00:28:20,730
Please, just stay away
from me. Stay away.

476
00:28:24,001 --> 00:28:26,503
Monster. Monster!

477
00:28:34,011 --> 00:28:35,545
Elsa!

478
00:28:41,218 --> 00:28:43,486
Elsa!

479
00:28:48,192 --> 00:28:49,826
Wait, please!

480
00:29:02,173 --> 00:29:03,973
Elsa, stop!

481
00:29:03,975 --> 00:29:05,275
Anna!

482
00:29:05,277 --> 00:29:06,776
No.

483
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:13,717
The fjord.

484
00:29:32,169 --> 00:29:34,404
Snow!
Snow?

485
00:29:34,406 --> 00:29:35,071
Yes, snow.

486
00:29:35,073 --> 00:29:37,440
- Are you all right?
- No.

487
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:39,342
Did you know?

488
00:29:39,610 --> 00:29:40,977
No.

489
00:29:40,979 --> 00:29:42,645
Look, it's snowing.
It's snowing!

490
00:29:42,647 --> 00:29:44,314
The queen has cursed
this land!

491
00:29:44,316 --> 00:29:46,983
She must be stopped!
You have to go after her.

492
00:29:46,985 --> 00:29:48,017
Wait, no!

493
00:29:48,019 --> 00:29:50,820
You! Is there sorcery
in you, too?

494
00:29:50,822 --> 00:29:52,355
Are you a monster, too?

495
00:29:52,357 --> 00:29:55,525
No, no.
I'm completely ordinary.

496
00:29:55,527 --> 00:29:57,594
That's right, she is.

497
00:29:57,962 --> 00:29:59,562
In the best way.

498
00:29:59,564 --> 00:30:01,231
And my sister
is not a monster.

499
00:30:01,233 --> 00:30:02,765
She nearly killed me!

500
00:30:02,767 --> 00:30:04,500
- You slipped on ice.
- Her ice.

501
00:30:04,502 --> 00:30:06,969
It was an accident.
She was scared.

502
00:30:06,971 --> 00:30:10,306
She didn't mean it.
She didn't mean any of this.

503
00:30:10,308 --> 00:30:12,942
Tonight was my fault.
I pushed her.

504
00:30:12,944 --> 00:30:15,543
- So, I'm the one that
needs to go after her.
- What?

505
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:19,281
- Bring me my horse, please.
- Anna, no. It's too dangerous.

506
00:30:19,384 --> 00:30:21,617
Elsa is not dangerous.

507
00:30:21,619 --> 00:30:23,586
I'll bring her back,
and I'll make this right.

508
00:30:23,588 --> 00:30:25,020
I'm coming with you.

509
00:30:25,022 --> 00:30:28,058
No, I need you here
to take care of Arendelle.

510
00:30:28,192 --> 00:30:30,060
On my honor.

511
00:30:31,863 --> 00:30:34,097
I leave Prince Hans in charge.

512
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,300
Are you sure
you can trust her?

513
00:30:37,402 --> 00:30:39,636
I don't want you
getting hurt.

514
00:30:39,638 --> 00:30:41,271
She's my sister.

515
00:30:41,373 --> 00:30:43,273
She would never hurt me.

516
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:27,050
<i># The snow glows white

517
00:31:27,052 --> 00:31:30,987

539

540
00:33:02,747 --> 00:33:04,447

00:33:04,449 --> 00:33:07,016

546
00:33:17,061 --> 00:33:21,130

Let it go!</i>

547
00:33:21,132 --> 00:33:25,101

<i># All around</i>

555
00:33:56,634 --> 00:34:02,839

<i># The cold never

566
00:34:48,919 --> 00:34:50,887
Elsa!

567
00:34:51,789 --> 00:34:53,456
Elsa!

568
00:34:55,493 --> 00:34:57,160
Elsa, it's me, Anna,

569
00:34:57,262 --> 00:35:00,830
your sister who didn't mean
to make you freeze the summer.

570
00:35:00,832 --> 00:35:04,934
I'm sorry.
It's all my fault.

571
00:35:06,203 --> 00:35:08,204
Of course, none of it
would have happened

572
00:35:08,205 --> 00:35:10,773
if she had just
told me her secret.

573
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:12,942
She's a stinker.

574
00:35:13,076 --> 00:35:15,177
Whoa!

575
00:35:17,515 --> 00:35:19,215
Oh, no. No, no, no!
Come back!

576
00:35:19,217 --> 00:35:21,183
No, no, no!

577
00:35:21,485 --> 00:35:23,419
Okay.

578
00:35:28,927 --> 00:35:32,061
Snow.
It had to be snow.

579
00:35:32,063 --> 00:35:34,597
She couldn't have
had tropical magic

580
00:35:34,599 --> 00:35:38,768
that covered the fjords
in white sand and warm...

581
00:35:40,003 --> 00:35:41,637
Fire!

582
00:35:49,112 --> 00:35:51,980
Cold, cold, cold,
cold, cold.

583
00:36:08,866 --> 00:36:11,000
Ooh. "And sauna"!

584
00:36:16,041 --> 00:36:18,141
- Yoo-hoo.
- Hmm?

585
00:36:18,609 --> 00:36:20,276
Big summer blowout.

586
00:36:20,378 --> 00:36:22,611
Half off swimming suits, clogs,

587
00:36:22,613 --> 00:36:25,848
and a sun balm
of my own invention, yah?

588
00:36:26,216 --> 00:36:30,753
Oh. Great. For now, um,
how about boots?

589
00:36:30,755 --> 00:36:32,788
Winter boots and dresses?

590
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:35,524
That would be
in our winter department.

591
00:36:38,228 --> 00:36:39,729
Oh. Um...

592
00:36:39,731 --> 00:36:40,930
I was just wondering.

593
00:36:40,932 --> 00:36:42,832
Has another young woman...

594
00:36:42,834 --> 00:36:46,002
The queen perhaps,
I don't know,

595
00:36:46,004 --> 00:36:46,736
passed through here?

596
00:36:46,738 --> 00:36:48,571
The only one crazy enough
to be out in this storm

597
00:36:48,573 --> 00:36:50,473
is you, dear.

598
00:36:57,014 --> 00:36:58,781
You and this fellow.

599
00:36:58,783 --> 00:36:59,449
Yoo-hoo.

600
00:36:59,451 --> 00:37:01,284
Big summer blowout.

601
00:37:05,889 --> 00:37:07,590
Carrots.

602
00:37:07,592 --> 00:37:09,025
Huh?

603
00:37:09,027 --> 00:37:10,893
Behind you.

604
00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:13,329
Oh! Right.
Excuse me.

605
00:37:13,463 --> 00:37:16,198
Oh. A real howler
in July, yes?

606
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:19,135
Wherever could it be
coming from?

607
00:37:19,137 --> 00:37:21,170
The North Mountain.

608
00:37:21,205 --> 00:37:22,739
North Mountain.

609
00:37:22,941 --> 00:37:25,873
- That will be 40.
- Forty? No, 10.

610
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:27,243
Oh, dear, that's no good.

611
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:29,111
See, this is from
our winter stock,

612
00:37:29,113 --> 00:37:31,180
where supply and demand
have a big problem.

613
00:37:31,182 --> 00:37:34,749
You want to talk about
a supply and demand problem?
I sell ice for a living.

614
00:37:34,885 --> 00:37:36,952
Ooh. That's a rough business
to be in right now.

615
00:37:36,954 --> 00:37:39,422
I mean, that is really...

616
00:37:39,489 --> 00:37:40,890
That's unfortunate.

617
00:37:40,892 --> 00:37:41,957
Still 40.

618
00:37:41,959 --> 00:37:44,760
But I will throw in
a visit to Oaken's sauna.

619
00:37:44,762 --> 00:37:47,096
Yoo-hoo.
Hi, family.

620
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:48,364
Yoo-hoo!

621
00:37:48,366 --> 00:37:51,100
Ten is all I got.
Help me out.

622
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:54,103
Okay. Ten will get you
this and no more.

623
00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:54,970
Okay, just tell me one thing.

624
00:37:54,972 --> 00:37:57,306
What was happening
on the North Mountain?

625
00:37:57,308 --> 00:37:59,408
Did it seem magical?

626
00:37:59,410 --> 00:38:01,077
Yes!

627
00:38:01,079 --> 00:38:04,814
Now, back up while I deal
with this crook, here.

628
00:38:07,317 --> 00:38:09,418
What did you call me?

629
00:38:09,786 --> 00:38:12,154
Okay, okay.
I'm out.

630
00:38:12,156 --> 00:38:13,222
Whoa!

631
00:38:13,224 --> 00:38:15,057
Bye-bye.

632
00:38:18,528 --> 00:38:22,031
No, Sven,
I didn't get your carrots.

633
00:38:22,633 --> 00:38:25,067
But I did find us
a place to sleep.

634
00:38:25,069 --> 00:38:27,303
And it's free.

635
00:38:28,105 --> 00:38:29,605
I'm sorry about this violence.

636
00:38:29,607 --> 00:38:31,740
I will add a quart of lutefisk,

637
00:38:31,742 --> 00:38:32,908
so we have good feelings.

638
00:38:32,910 --> 00:38:35,711
Just the outfit
and the boots, yah?

639
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:38,114
Uh...

640
00:38:45,655 --> 00:38:49,325
<i># Reindeers are better
than people</i>

641
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:52,561
<i># Sven,
don't you think that's true?</i>

642
00:38:52,563 --> 00:38:55,831
<i># "Yeah, people will beat you
And curse you and cheat you</i>

643
00:38:55,833 --> 00:38:59,168
<i># "Every one of them's bad,
except you"</i>

644
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:00,803
Aw. Thanks, buddy.

645
00:39:00,805 --> 00:39:04,473
<i># But people smell
better than reindeers</i>

646
00:39:04,475 --> 00:39:08,310
<i># Sven,
don't you think I'm right?</i>

647
00:39:08,312 --> 00:39:12,181
<i># "That's once again true
For all, except you"</i>

648
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:15,885
<i># You got me
Let's call it a night</i>

649
00:39:15,887 --> 00:39:18,187
<i># "Good night"</i>

650
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:22,591
<i># Don't let the frostbite</i>

651
00:39:22,593 --> 00:39:25,361
<i># Bite #</i>

652
00:39:25,562 --> 00:39:26,996
Nice duet.

653
00:39:26,998 --> 00:39:30,266
It's just you.
What do you want?

654
00:39:30,268 --> 00:39:33,335
I want you to take me up
the North Mountain.

655
00:39:35,739 --> 00:39:38,274
I don't take people places.

656
00:39:38,441 --> 00:39:40,142
Let me rephrase that.

657
00:39:40,144 --> 00:39:42,077
Hey.

658
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:44,280
Take me up
the North Mountain.

659
00:39:44,548 --> 00:39:46,482
Please.

660
00:39:51,054 --> 00:39:54,089
Look, I know how
to stop this winter.

661
00:39:55,927 --> 00:39:57,493
We leave at dawn.

662
00:39:57,495 --> 00:40:00,429
And you forgot
the carrots for Sven.

663
00:40:00,897 --> 00:40:01,764
Oops, sorry.

664
00:40:01,766 --> 00:40:05,034
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- I didn't...

665
00:40:05,036 --> 00:40:07,937
We leave now.
Right now.

666
00:40:10,707 --> 00:40:12,241
Whew!

667
00:40:19,282 --> 00:40:22,616
- Hang on! We like to go fast.
- I like fast.

668
00:40:22,618 --> 00:40:23,652

Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa...

669
00:40:23,654 --> 00:40:25,921
Get your feet down.
This is fresh lacquer.

670
00:40:25,923 --> 00:40:28,323
Seriously,
were you raised in a barn?

671
00:40:28,324 --> 00:40:31,328
Ugh! No, I was
raised in a castle.

672
00:40:32,863 --> 00:40:34,496
So, uh, tell me,

673
00:40:34,498 --> 00:40:37,032
What made the queen go
all ice-crazy?

674
00:40:37,034 --> 00:40:38,467
Oh. Well...

675
00:40:38,469 --> 00:40:39,401
It was all my fault.

676
00:40:39,403 --> 00:40:42,070
I got engaged,
but then she freaked out,

677
00:40:42,072 --> 00:40:44,940
because I'd only just
met him, you know, that day.

678
00:40:44,942 --> 00:40:47,108
And she said she wouldn't
bless the marriage, and...

679
00:40:47,110 --> 00:40:50,512
Wait. You got engaged to
someone you just met that day?

680
00:40:50,514 --> 00:40:53,682
Yeah. Anyway, I got mad,
and so she got mad,

681
00:40:53,684 --> 00:40:56,550
and then she tried to walk away,
and I grabbed her glove...

682
00:40:56,587 --> 00:41:01,986
Hang on! You mean to tell me
you got engaged to someone
you just met that day?

683
00:41:01,993 --> 00:41:03,191
Yes. Pay attention.

684
00:41:03,193 --> 00:41:06,261
But the thing is, she wore
the gloves all the time

685
00:41:06,263 --> 00:41:08,864
so, I just thought, maybe she
has a thing about dirt.

686
00:41:08,866 --> 00:41:12,167
Didn't your parents ever
warn you about strangers?

687
00:41:12,469 --> 00:41:14,403
Yes, they did.

688
00:41:14,505 --> 00:41:17,072
But Hans is not a stranger.

689
00:41:17,074 --> 00:41:18,908
Oh, yeah?
What's his last name?

690
00:41:18,910 --> 00:41:21,310
"Of the Southern Isles".

691
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:22,811
- What's his favorite food?
- Sandwiches.

692
00:41:22,813 --> 00:41:24,713
- Best friend's name?
- Probably John.

693
00:41:24,715 --> 00:41:25,347
- Eye color?
- Dreamy.

694
00:41:25,349 --> 00:41:26,982
- Foot size?
- Foot size doesn't matter.

695
00:41:26,984 --> 00:41:28,450
Have you had a meal
with him yet?

696
00:41:28,452 --> 00:41:30,252
What if you hate
the way he eats?

697
00:41:30,254 --> 00:41:32,021
What if you hate
the way he picks his nose?

698
00:41:32,023 --> 00:41:33,255
Picks his nose?

699
00:41:33,257 --> 00:41:34,056
And eats it.

700
00:41:34,058 --> 00:41:37,293
Excuse me, sir.
He is a prince.

701
00:41:37,494 --> 00:41:39,094
All men do it.
Ew.

702
00:41:39,096 --> 00:41:42,598
Look, it doesn't matter.
It's true love.

703
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:43,465
It doesn't sound
like true love.

704
00:41:43,467 --> 00:41:46,802
Are you some
sort of love expert?

705
00:41:46,804 --> 00:41:50,105
No. But, uh, I have
friends who are.

706
00:41:50,107 --> 00:41:53,540
You have friends
who are love experts?
I'm not buying it.

707
00:41:53,544 --> 00:41:55,044
- Stop talking.
- No, no, no. No, no.

708
00:41:55,046 --> 00:41:57,746
- I'd like to meet these...
- No, I mean it.

709
00:42:11,929 --> 00:42:13,862
Sven, go.
Go!

710
00:42:15,066 --> 00:42:16,466
- What are they?
- Wolves.

711
00:42:16,468 --> 00:42:17,800
Wolves?

712
00:42:20,103 --> 00:42:21,536
- What do we do?
- I got this.

713
00:42:21,538 --> 00:42:23,939
You just... Don't fall off,
and don't get eaten.

714
00:42:23,941 --> 00:42:25,140
But I want to help!

715
00:42:25,142 --> 00:42:25,741
- No.
- Why not?

716
00:42:25,743 --> 00:42:27,309
Because I don't trust
your judgment.

717
00:42:27,311 --> 00:42:28,077
Excuse me?

718
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:30,446
Who marries a man
she just met?

719
00:42:30,448 --> 00:42:31,580
It's true love!

720
00:42:31,582 --> 00:42:33,148
Whoa!

721
00:42:33,150 --> 00:42:34,617
Whoa.
Whoa!

722
00:42:34,619 --> 00:42:36,318
Christopher!

723
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:37,586
It's "Kristoff"!

724
00:42:37,588 --> 00:42:38,988
Ow!

725
00:42:42,092 --> 00:42:43,592
Duck!

726
00:42:47,365 --> 00:42:49,064
You almost set me on fire!

727
00:42:49,066 --> 00:42:50,199
But I didn't.

728
00:42:56,573 --> 00:42:57,840
Get ready to jump, Sven!

729
00:42:57,842 --> 00:42:59,508
You don't tell him
what to do.

730
00:42:59,510 --> 00:43:01,477
- Hey!
- I do!

731
00:43:02,078 --> 00:43:03,412
Jump, Sven!

732
00:43:13,257 --> 00:43:14,790
Phew!

733
00:43:17,662 --> 00:43:19,595
But I just paid it off.

734
00:43:19,597 --> 00:43:21,730
Uh-oh.
No. No.

735
00:43:21,865 --> 00:43:22,464
No!

736
00:43:22,466 --> 00:43:24,767
Ah! No, no, no,
no, no, no, no!

737
00:43:24,769 --> 00:43:26,302
Grab on!

738
00:43:26,304 --> 00:43:27,736
Pull, Sven.
Pull!

739
00:43:35,980 --> 00:43:37,613
Whoa.

740
00:43:39,050 --> 00:43:43,452
I'll replace your sled,
and everything in it.

741
00:43:44,087 --> 00:43:49,057
And I understand if you don't
want to help me anymore.

742
00:43:53,297 --> 00:43:55,864
Of course I don't want to
help her anymore.

743
00:43:55,866 --> 00:44:00,235
In fact, this whole thing
has ruined me for helping
anyone ever again.

744
00:44:00,237 --> 00:44:01,170
It's this way?

745
00:44:01,172 --> 00:44:03,105
"She'll die on her own".

746
00:44:03,107 --> 00:44:04,640
- I can live with that.
- Here we go.

747
00:44:04,642 --> 00:44:08,543
"But you won't get
your new sled if she's dead".

748
00:44:08,545 --> 00:44:10,212
I think, actually, it's up.

749
00:44:10,214 --> 00:44:11,813
Sometimes,
I really don't like you.

750
00:44:11,815 --> 00:44:14,583
Hold up!
We're coming.

751
00:44:14,584 --> 00:44:15,584
You are?

752
00:44:15,586 --> 00:44:19,387
I mean, sure.
I'll let you tag along.

753
00:44:29,634 --> 00:44:31,433
Arendelle.

754
00:44:31,535 --> 00:44:34,170
It's completely frozen.

755
00:44:35,105 --> 00:44:38,307
But it will be fine.
Elsa will thaw it.

756
00:44:38,308 --> 00:44:39,575
Will she?

757
00:44:39,577 --> 00:44:41,110
Yeah.
Now, come on.

758
00:44:41,112 --> 00:44:43,278
This way to the
North Mountain?

759
00:44:44,081 --> 00:44:47,716
More like...
this way.

760
00:45:18,314 --> 00:45:22,818
I never knew winter
could be so beautiful.

761
00:45:23,386 --> 00:45:24,453
Yeah.

762
00:45:24,455 --> 00:45:27,289
It really is beautiful,
isn't it?

763
00:45:27,291 --> 00:45:28,757
But it's so white.

764
00:45:28,759 --> 00:45:30,359
You know,
how about a little color?

765
00:45:30,361 --> 00:45:34,329
I'm thinking maybe some
crimson, chartreuse.

766
00:45:34,331 --> 00:45:35,931
How about yellow?

767
00:45:35,933 --> 00:45:38,333
No, not yellow.
Yellow and snow?

768
00:45:38,335 --> 00:45:39,768
No go.

769
00:45:43,107 --> 00:45:45,240
Am I right?

770
00:45:45,242 --> 00:45:46,175
Hi.
You're creepy.

771
00:45:46,177 --> 00:45:47,276
Whoa!
I don't want it.

772
00:45:47,278 --> 00:45:49,144
- Back at you.
- Please don't drop me.

773
00:45:49,146 --> 00:45:50,412
Come on,
it's just a head.

774
00:45:50,414 --> 00:45:52,280
Sorry.
We got off to a bad start.

775
00:45:52,282 --> 00:45:54,115
Ew, ew, ew, the body!

776
00:45:56,787 --> 00:45:58,754
Wait, what am I looking
at right now?

777
00:45:58,756 --> 00:46:01,357
Why are you hanging off
the earth like a bat?

778
00:46:01,459 --> 00:46:03,492
All right, wait one second.

779
00:46:03,494 --> 00:46:04,927
Oh. Uh...

780
00:46:04,929 --> 00:46:05,761
Oh!

781
00:46:05,763 --> 00:46:07,529
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

782
00:46:07,531 --> 00:46:09,330
Now, I'm perfect.

783
00:46:09,734 --> 00:46:10,899
Well, almost.

784
00:46:11,101 --> 00:46:13,501
It was like my whole life
got turned upside down.

785
00:46:13,803 --> 00:46:15,437
Oh! Too hard.
I'm sorry!

786
00:46:15,439 --> 00:46:17,439
- Head rush!
- Are you okay?

787
00:46:17,441 --> 00:46:20,843
Are you kidding me?
I am wonderful!

788
00:46:20,845 --> 00:46:23,045
I've always wanted a nose.

789
00:46:23,047 --> 00:46:24,012
So cute.

790
00:46:24,014 --> 00:46:25,947
It's like a little
baby unicorn.

791
00:46:25,949 --> 00:46:27,282
But... Hey! Whoa!

792
00:46:27,284 --> 00:46:28,217
Oh.

793
00:46:28,219 --> 00:46:30,118
I love it even more.

794
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:33,455
All right,
let's start this thing over.

795
00:46:33,457 --> 00:46:34,723
Hi, everyone.

796
00:46:34,725 --> 00:46:35,457
I'm Olaf.

797
00:46:35,459 --> 00:46:37,326
And I like warm hugs.

798
00:46:38,195 --> 00:46:39,928
Olaf?

799
00:46:42,299 --> 00:46:44,633
That's right. Olaf.

800
00:46:45,635 --> 00:46:47,970
And you are?

801
00:46:47,972 --> 00:46:49,605
Oh. Um...

802
00:46:49,607 --> 00:46:50,038
I'm Anna.

803
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:52,708
And who's the funky-looking
donkey over there?

804
00:46:52,710 --> 00:46:54,409
That's Sven.
Uh-huh.

805
00:46:54,411 --> 00:46:56,345
And who's the reindeer?

806
00:46:56,579 --> 00:46:57,079
Sven.

807
00:46:57,081 --> 00:46:59,815
Oh, the... Oh. Okay.
That makes things easier for me.

808
00:46:59,817 --> 00:47:02,951
Aw, look at him
trying to kiss my nose.

809
00:47:02,953 --> 00:47:05,254
I like you, too.
Olaf.

810
00:47:05,256 --> 00:47:07,656
- Did Elsa build you?
- Yeah. Why?

811
00:47:07,658 --> 00:47:09,657
- Do you know where she is?
- Yeah. Why?

812
00:47:09,727 --> 00:47:11,960
Do you think you could
show us the way?

813
00:47:11,962 --> 00:47:14,061
- Yeah. Why?
- How does this work? Ow!

814
00:47:14,031 --> 00:47:16,265
Stop it, Sven.
I'm trying to focus, here.

815
00:47:16,267 --> 00:47:18,634
- Yeah. Why?
- I'll tell you why.

816
00:47:18,636 --> 00:47:21,003
We need Elsa
to bring back summer.

817
00:47:21,005 --> 00:47:22,704
- Summer?
- Mmm-hmm.

818
00:47:22,706 --> 00:47:23,438
Oh. I don't know why,

819
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:27,409
but I've always loved
the idea of summer.

820
00:47:27,411 --> 00:47:31,613
And sun,
and all things hot.

821
00:47:31,615 --> 00:47:32,080
Really?

822
00:47:32,082 --> 00:47:35,183
I'm guessing you don't have
much experience with heat.

823
00:47:35,251 --> 00:47:36,084
Nope.

824
00:47:36,286 --> 00:47:38,853
But sometimes
I like to close my eyes,

825
00:47:38,955 --> 00:47:43,325
and imagine what it would be
like when summer does come.

826
00:47:45,762 --> 00:47:50,065
<i># Bees will buzz
Kids will blow dandelion fuzz</i>

827
00:47:50,067 --> 00:47:56,204
<i># And I'll be doing
Whatever snow does in summer</i>

828
00:47:57,106 --> 00:47:59,207
<i># A drink in my hand</i>

829
00:47:59,209 --> 00:48:01,209
<i># My snow up
against the burning sand</i>

830
00:48:01,211 --> 00:48:04,212
<i># Probably getting
gorgeously tanned</i>

831
00:48:04,214 --> 00:48:05,647
<i># In summer</i>

832
00:48:05,649 --> 00:48:08,316
<i># I'll finally see
a summer breeze</i>

833
00:48:08,318 --> 00:48:09,884
<i># Blow away a winter storm</i>

834
00:48:09,886 --> 00:48:12,821
<i># And find out
what happens to solid water</i>

835
00:48:12,823 --> 00:48:16,357
<i># When it gets warm</i>

836
00:48:17,593 --> 00:48:19,427
<i># And I can't wait to see</i>

837
00:48:19,429 --> 00:48:21,529
<i># What my buddies
all think of me</i>

838
00:48:21,531 --> 00:48:24,532
<i># Just imagine
how much cooler I'll be</i>

839
00:48:24,534 --> 00:48:27,335
<i># In summer!</i>

840
00:48:30,739 --> 00:48:32,607
<i># The hot and the cold
are both so intense</i>

841
00:48:32,609 --> 00:48:36,111
<i># Put them together
It just makes sense</i>

842
00:48:39,548 --> 00:48:41,850
<i># Winter's a good time
To stay in and cuddle</i>

843
00:48:41,852 --> 00:48:44,853
<i># But put me in summer
and I'll be a...</i>

844
00:48:45,654 --> 00:48:47,222
<i># Happy snowman!</i>

845
00:48:47,224 --> 00:48:48,356
<i># When life gets rough</i>

846
00:48:48,358 --> 00:48:50,291
<i># I like to hold
on to my dream</i>

847
00:48:50,293 --> 00:48:56,531
<i># Relaxing in the summer sun
Just letting off steam</i>

848
00:48:57,766 --> 00:48:59,334
<i># Oh, the sky</i>

849
00:48:59,336 --> 00:49:01,002
<i># Will be blue</i>

850
00:49:01,004 --> 00:49:04,906
<i># And you guys
will be there, too</i>

851
00:49:04,908 --> 00:49:05,974
<i># When I finally do</i>

852
00:49:05,976 --> 00:49:09,478
<i># What frozen things do
In summer!</i>

853
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:12,514
- I'm gonna tell him.
- Don't you dare.

854
00:49:13,082 --> 00:49:17,519
<i># In summer! #</i>

855
00:49:20,189 --> 00:49:22,591
So, come on!
Elsa's this way.

856
00:49:22,593 --> 00:49:25,761
Let's go bring back summer!

857
00:49:25,763 --> 00:49:27,729
I'm coming!

858
00:49:28,631 --> 00:49:31,033
Somebody's gotta tell him.

859
00:49:35,372 --> 00:49:38,140
No, no. You've got
the bark facing down.

860
00:49:38,142 --> 00:49:39,741
The bark needs
to be face-up.

861
00:49:39,743 --> 00:49:42,210
- Bark down is drier.
- Bark up!

862
00:49:42,212 --> 00:49:43,211
- Bark down!
- Papa!

863
00:49:43,213 --> 00:49:45,080
Cloak? Does anyone
need a cloak?

864
00:49:45,082 --> 00:49:48,383
Arendelle is indebted
to you, Your Highness.

865
00:49:48,385 --> 00:49:49,351
The castle is open.

866
00:49:49,353 --> 00:49:53,088
There is soup and hot glogg
in the great hall.

867
00:49:53,090 --> 00:49:54,222
Here, pass these out.

868
00:49:54,224 --> 00:49:55,423
Prince Hans!

869
00:49:55,425 --> 00:49:57,926
Are we expected
to just sit here and freeze

870
00:49:57,928 --> 00:50:00,929
while you give away all
of Arendelle's tradable goods?

871
00:50:00,931 --> 00:50:02,731
Princess Anna
has given her orders.

872
00:50:02,733 --> 00:50:04,031
And that's another thing!

873
00:50:04,033 --> 00:50:07,135
Has it dawned on you that your
princess may be conspiring

874
00:50:07,137 --> 00:50:09,323
with a wicked sorceress
to destroy us all?

875
00:50:09,339 --> 00:50:11,039
Do not question
the princess.

876
00:50:11,041 --> 00:50:12,607
She left me in charge

877
00:50:12,609 --> 00:50:15,842
and I will not hesitate
to protect Arendelle from treason.

878
00:50:15,879 --> 00:50:17,646
Treason?

879
00:50:22,952 --> 00:50:23,985
Whoa! Whoa!

880
00:50:23,987 --> 00:50:26,021
Whoa, boy.
Easy.

881
00:50:26,023 --> 00:50:26,855
Easy.

882
00:50:26,857 --> 00:50:28,123
It's Princess Anna's horse.

883
00:50:28,125 --> 00:50:29,791
So, where is the princess?

884
00:50:29,793 --> 00:50:32,294
- Where could she be?
- Where is she?

885
00:50:32,296 --> 00:50:34,129
Princess Anna is in trouble.

886
00:50:34,131 --> 00:50:37,299
I need volunteers to go
with me to find her.

887
00:50:37,301 --> 00:50:38,133
- I'll go.
- I volunteer.

888
00:50:38,135 --> 00:50:41,069
I volunteer two men,
My Lord.

889
00:50:41,071 --> 00:50:42,704
Be prepared for anything.

890
00:50:42,706 --> 00:50:44,973
And should you
encounter the queen,

891
00:50:44,975 --> 00:50:48,577
you are to put an end
to this winter.

892
00:50:48,579 --> 00:50:50,812
Do you understand?
Hmm.

893
00:50:53,616 --> 00:50:57,786
So, how exactly are you
planning to stop this weather?

894
00:50:57,788 --> 00:51:00,555
Oh. I am gonna talk
to my sister.

895
00:51:00,557 --> 00:51:01,122
That's your plan?

896
00:51:01,124 --> 00:51:04,626
My ice business is riding on
you talking to your sister?

897
00:51:04,628 --> 00:51:06,027
Yep.

898
00:51:06,029 --> 00:51:08,263
So, you're not at all
afraid of her?

899
00:51:08,265 --> 00:51:09,564
- Why would I be?
- Yeah.

900
00:51:09,566 --> 00:51:15,370
I bet she's the nicest,
gentlest, warmest person ever.

901
00:51:15,605 --> 00:51:16,671
Oh. Look at that.

902
00:51:16,673 --> 00:51:19,941
I've been impaled.

903
00:51:23,146 --> 00:51:24,647
What now?

904
00:51:24,948 --> 00:51:27,216
Mmm...

905
00:51:27,650 --> 00:51:28,683
It's too steep.

906
00:51:28,685 --> 00:51:31,419
I've only got one rope and you
don't know how to climb mountains.

907
00:51:31,421 --> 00:51:32,755
Says who?

908
00:51:32,757 --> 00:51:34,123
Hmm?

909
00:51:34,125 --> 00:51:35,557
What are you doing?

910
00:51:35,559 --> 00:51:39,295
I'm going to see my sister.

911
00:51:39,497 --> 00:51:41,429
You're gonna kill yourself.

912
00:51:41,831 --> 00:51:43,632
I wouldn't put my foot there.

913
00:51:43,934 --> 00:51:45,767
- You're distracting me.
- Or there.

914
00:51:45,769 --> 00:51:47,735
How do you know
Elsa even wants to see you?

915
00:51:47,837 --> 00:51:49,570
All right.
I'm just blocking you out

916
00:51:49,572 --> 00:51:51,840
because I gotta
concentrate, here.

917
00:51:52,242 --> 00:51:55,742
You know, most people
who disappear into the mountains
want to be alone.

918
00:51:55,813 --> 00:51:57,913
Nobody wants to be alone.

919
00:51:58,015 --> 00:51:59,414
Except maybe you.

920
00:51:59,416 --> 00:52:02,985
I'm not alone.
I have friends, remember?

921
00:52:03,219 --> 00:52:05,620
You mean,
the love experts?

922
00:52:05,622 --> 00:52:08,223
Yes, the love experts.

923
00:52:08,391 --> 00:52:10,191
Ah...

924
00:52:10,193 --> 00:52:12,594
Please tell me
I'm almost there.

925
00:52:12,962 --> 00:52:15,763
Does the air seem a bit thin
to you up here?

926
00:52:17,501 --> 00:52:18,533
Hang on.

927
00:52:18,535 --> 00:52:19,167
Hey, Sven?

928
00:52:19,169 --> 00:52:21,336
Not sure if this is gonna
solve the problem

929
00:52:21,338 --> 00:52:24,538
but I found a staircase
that leads exactly where
you wanted to go.

930
00:52:24,541 --> 00:52:27,008
Ha-ha! Thank goodness.
Catch!

931
00:52:28,011 --> 00:52:31,313
Thanks. That was like
a crazy trust exercise.

932
00:52:44,895 --> 00:52:45,994
Whoa.

933
00:52:45,996 --> 00:52:47,930
Now, that's ice.

934
00:52:48,298 --> 00:52:49,931
I might cry.

935
00:52:49,933 --> 00:52:53,301
Go ahead.
I won't judge.

936
00:52:59,475 --> 00:53:01,943
All right, take it easy, boy.
Come here.

937
00:53:01,945 --> 00:53:03,912
I got you.

938
00:53:03,914 --> 00:53:06,581
Okay. You stay
right here, buddy.

939
00:53:08,185 --> 00:53:09,818
Flawless.

940
00:53:14,524 --> 00:53:16,124
Knock.

941
00:53:16,659 --> 00:53:18,360
Just knock.

942
00:53:18,662 --> 00:53:21,063
Why isn't she knocking?

943
00:53:21,165 --> 00:53:23,565
Do you think
she knows how to knock?

944
00:53:27,437 --> 00:53:29,872
Huh.
It opened.

945
00:53:29,874 --> 00:53:31,373
That's a first.

946
00:53:31,675 --> 00:53:35,009
Oh. You should probably
wait out here.   - What?

947
00:53:35,011 --> 00:53:38,411
The last time I introduced her
to a guy, she froze everything.

948
00:53:38,415 --> 00:53:41,681
But, but... Oh, come on!
It's a palace made of ice.

949
00:53:41,683 --> 00:53:44,118
- Ice is my life!
- Bye, Sven.

950
00:53:44,121 --> 00:53:45,654
You, too, Olaf.

951
00:53:45,956 --> 00:53:48,390
- Me?
- Just give us a minute.

952
00:53:48,392 --> 00:53:49,925
Okay.

953
00:53:50,593 --> 00:53:52,661
One, two,

954
00:53:52,663 --> 00:53:55,163
- three...
- Four...

955
00:53:59,869 --> 00:54:01,503
Whoa.

956
00:54:06,309 --> 00:54:07,909
Elsa?

957
00:54:08,344 --> 00:54:10,612
It's me, Anna.

958
00:54:14,017 --> 00:54:15,584
Anna.

959
00:54:19,188 --> 00:54:23,392
Whoa. Elsa, you
look different.

960
00:54:23,394 --> 00:54:25,327
It's a good different.

961
00:54:25,329 --> 00:54:27,062
And this place...

962
00:54:27,064 --> 00:54:28,664
It's amazing.

963
00:54:28,666 --> 00:54:29,498
Thank you.

964
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:32,367
I never knew what
I was capable of.

965
00:54:32,369 --> 00:54:35,370
I'm so sorry about what happened.
If I'd have known...

966
00:54:35,372 --> 00:54:36,771
No, no, no.
It's okay.

967
00:54:36,873 --> 00:54:41,610
You don't have to apologize,
but you should probably go.

968
00:54:41,978 --> 00:54:42,644
Please.

969
00:54:42,646 --> 00:54:44,246
But I just got here.

970
00:54:44,248 --> 00:54:46,815
You belong down
in Arendelle.

971
00:54:46,817 --> 00:54:48,016
So do you.

972
00:54:48,018 --> 00:54:50,519
No, Anna,
I belong here.

973
00:54:51,220 --> 00:54:52,254
Alone.

974
00:54:52,456 --> 00:54:56,892
Where I can be who I am
without hurting anybody.

975
00:54:56,894 --> 00:54:58,960
Actually, about that...

976
00:54:58,962 --> 00:55:01,329
- ... Sixty!
- Wait. What is that?

977
00:55:01,831 --> 00:55:05,033
Hi! I'm Olaf and
I like warm hugs!

978
00:55:05,134 --> 00:55:06,402
Olaf?

979
00:55:06,903 --> 00:55:08,637
Yeah.
You built me.

980
00:55:08,705 --> 00:55:10,405
Remember that?

981
00:55:10,407 --> 00:55:11,840
And you're alive?

982
00:55:11,842 --> 00:55:14,943
Um...
I think so.

983
00:55:15,645 --> 00:55:18,680
He's just like the one
we built as kids.

984
00:55:19,649 --> 00:55:21,116
Yeah.

985
00:55:21,118 --> 00:55:23,285
Elsa, we were so close.

986
00:55:23,587 --> 00:55:26,054
We can be like that again.

987
00:55:26,322 --> 00:55:28,657
<i>- Catch me!
- Slow down!</i>

988
00:55:31,961 --> 00:55:33,395
Anna!

989
00:55:36,031 --> 00:55:39,331
No. We can't.
Goodbye, Anna.

990
00:55:39,403 --> 00:55:40,568
Elsa, wait.

991
00:55:40,570 --> 00:55:42,803
No, I'm just trying
to protect you.

992
00:55:42,805 --> 00:55:45,740
You don't have to protect me.
I'm not afraid.

993
00:55:46,042 --> 00:55:48,410
Please don't
shut me out again.

What?

00:56:55,078 --> 00:56:59,214
You kind of set off
an eternal winter everywhere.

1021
00:56:59,216 --> 00:57:00,381
Everywhere?

1022
00:57:00,383 --> 00:57:02,417
Well, it's okay,
you can just unfreeze it.

1023
00:57:02,419 --> 00:57:04,819
No, I can't.
I don't know how.

1024

Are you okay?

1043

I'm okay.

1044

I'm fine.

Wait, it doesn't matter.
Just...

1047

You have to go.

1048
00:58:03,213 --> 00:58:06,614
No, I know we can
figure this out together.

1049
00:58:06,616 --> 00:58:07,081
How?

1050
00:58:07,083 --> 00:58:09,751
What power do you have
to stop this winter?

1051
00:58:09,752 --> 00:58:11,285
To stop me?

1052
00:58:11,287 --> 00:58:12,687
Anna, I think we should go.

1053
00:58:12,689 --> 00:58:15,022
No, I'm not leaving
without you, Elsa.

1054
00:58:15,024 --> 00:58:17,125
Yes, you are.

1055
00:58:24,901 --> 00:58:26,901
Stop!
Put us down!

1056
00:58:26,903 --> 00:58:29,370
Go away.

1057
00:58:32,041 --> 00:58:33,575

to throw people!

feisty-pants. Okay, relax.

- Okay! All right!

00:58:53,263 --> 00:58:55,262
Oh. Look, see?
Now, you made him mad.

1066
00:58:55,264 --> 00:58:57,432
I'll distract him.
You guys go.

1067
00:58:57,900 --> 00:58:59,968
No, no! Not you guys!

1068
00:59:00,502 --> 00:59:02,971
This just got
a whole lot harder.

1069
00:59:05,208 --> 00:59:06,841
Look out!

1070
00:59:18,989 --> 00:59:20,722
Run! Run!

1071
00:59:20,724 --> 00:59:22,724
What are you doing?

1072
00:59:25,963 --> 00:59:27,462
I got him!

1073
00:59:27,464 --> 00:59:29,130
Whoa! Stop!

1074
00:59:29,132 --> 00:59:30,865
It's a 100-foot drop.

1075
00:59:30,867 --> 00:59:32,533
It's 200.

1076
00:59:32,535 --> 00:59:33,701
Ow!

1077
00:59:33,703 --> 00:59:36,404
- What's that for?
- I'm digging a snow anchor.

1078
00:59:36,406 --> 00:59:38,206
Okay.
What if we fall?

1079
00:59:38,208 --> 00:59:40,341
There's 20 feet of fresh
powder down there.

1080
00:59:40,343 --> 00:59:42,143
It'll be like
landing on a pillow.

1081
00:59:42,145 --> 00:59:43,578
Hopefully.

1082
00:59:46,483 --> 00:59:48,316
Okay, Anna.
On three.

1083
00:59:48,318 --> 00:59:49,417
- Okay.
- One...

1084
00:59:49,419 --> 00:59:50,585
You tell me when.
I'm ready to go.

1085
00:59:50,587 --> 00:59:52,553
- Two...
- I was born ready! Yes!

1086
00:59:52,555 --> 00:59:54,088
Calm down.

1087
00:59:56,626 --> 00:59:58,026
Tree!

1088
00:59:58,028 --> 00:59:59,360
What the... Whoa!

1089
00:59:59,362 --> 01:00:02,230
That happened.

1090
01:00:03,499 --> 01:00:05,967
Man, am I out of shape.

1091
01:00:10,806 --> 01:00:12,406
There we go.
Hey, Anna!

1092
01:00:12,708 --> 01:00:14,442
Sven! Where did
you guys go?

1093
01:00:14,444 --> 01:00:17,045
We totally lost
Marshmallow back there.

1094
01:00:17,447 --> 01:00:20,081
Hey! We were just
talking about you.

1095
01:00:20,083 --> 01:00:22,817
All good things,
all good things.

1096
01:00:23,052 --> 01:00:24,652
No!

1097
01:00:27,090 --> 01:00:30,425
This is not making much
of a difference, is it?

1098
01:00:31,628 --> 01:00:32,727
Olaf!

1099
01:00:33,229 --> 01:00:34,896
Hang in there, guys!

1100
01:00:34,998 --> 01:00:36,531
Go. Go faster!

1101
01:00:37,933 --> 01:00:40,268
- Wait, what?
- Hey!

1102
01:00:43,673 --> 01:00:45,173
Ow!

1103
01:00:45,275 --> 01:00:46,808
Kristoff!

1104
01:00:48,445 --> 01:00:51,115
Don't come back!

1105
01:00:51,214 --> 01:00:52,680
We won't.

1106
01:00:59,856 --> 01:01:03,158
Hey, you were right.
Just like a pillow.

1107
01:01:03,560 --> 01:01:04,826
Olaf!

1108
01:01:04,928 --> 01:01:08,163
I can't feel my legs!
I can't feel my legs!

1109
01:01:09,566 --> 01:01:11,165
- Those are my legs.
- Ooh!

1110
01:01:11,167 --> 01:01:13,534
Hey, do me a favor,
grab my butt.

1111
01:01:13,836 --> 01:01:15,570
Oh. That feels better.

1112
01:01:15,572 --> 01:01:17,939
Hey, Sven!
He found us.

1113
01:01:17,941 --> 01:01:19,974
Who's my cute
little reindeer?

1114
01:01:19,976 --> 01:01:22,377
Don't talk to him
like that.

1115
01:01:22,679 --> 01:01:24,346
You're tickling me.

1116
01:01:25,014 --> 01:01:26,448
Here.

1117
01:01:26,950 --> 01:01:27,882
Whoa!

1118
01:01:27,584 --> 01:01:29,017
Are you okay?

1119
01:01:29,019 --> 01:01:30,718
Thank you.

1120
01:01:30,886 --> 01:01:32,587
- How's your head?
- Ah! Ooh!

1121
01:01:34,224 --> 01:01:34,989
It's fine. Uh...

1122
01:01:34,991 --> 01:01:36,991
Uh, I'm good.
I've got a thick skull.

1123
01:01:36,993 --> 01:01:38,893
I don't have a skull.

1124
01:01:39,929 --> 01:01:40,862
Or bones.

1125
01:01:40,864 --> 01:01:43,865
So, uh...
So, now what?

1126
01:01:43,867 --> 01:01:45,700
Now what?

1127
01:01:46,002 --> 01:01:47,369
Now what?

1128
01:01:47,471 --> 01:01:48,603
Oh...

1129
01:01:48,605 --> 01:01:50,405
What am I gonna do?

1130
01:01:50,506 --> 01:01:51,872
She threw me out.

1131
01:01:51,874 --> 01:01:54,308
I can't go back to Arendelle
with the weather like this.

1132
01:01:54,410 --> 01:01:56,343
And then there's
your ice business.

1133
01:01:56,345 --> 01:01:58,779
Hey, hey. Don't worry
about my ice business.

1134
01:01:58,798 --> 01:02:00,181
Worry about your hair!

1135
01:02:00,183 --> 01:02:02,783
What? I just fell off a cliff.
You should see your hair.

1136
01:02:02,785 --> 01:02:04,419
No, yours is turning white.

1137
01:02:04,521 --> 01:02:06,854
White? It's...
What?

1138
01:02:07,256 --> 01:02:09,991
It's because she struck you,
isn't it?

1139
01:02:09,993 --> 01:02:12,260
Does it look bad?

1140
01:02:12,528 --> 01:02:14,362
- No.
- You hesitated.

1141
01:02:14,364 --> 01:02:15,462
No, I didn't.

1142
01:02:15,464 --> 01:02:17,632
Anna, you need help, okay?
Come on.

1143
01:02:17,634 --> 01:02:19,367
Okay!
Where are we going?

1144
01:02:19,369 --> 01:02:20,635
To see my friends.

1145
01:02:20,637 --> 01:02:21,703
The love experts?

1146
01:02:21,705 --> 01:02:23,271
- Love experts?
- Uh-huh.

1147
01:02:23,273 --> 01:02:26,474
And don't worry,
they'll be able to fix this.

1148
01:02:26,476 --> 01:02:28,443
How do you know?

1149
01:02:28,445 --> 01:02:31,312
Because I've seen them
do it before.

1150
01:02:31,580 --> 01:02:34,582
I like to consider myself
a love expert.

1151
01:02:39,021 --> 01:02:41,089
Get it together.

1152
01:02:41,190 --> 01:02:42,657
Control it.

1153
01:02:42,659 --> 01:02:44,892
Don't feel.
Don't feel.

1154
01:02:44,894 --> 01:02:46,628
Don't feel.

1155
01:02:46,730 --> 01:02:48,630
Don't feel!

1156
01:03:02,745 --> 01:03:05,947
Look, Sven,
the sky is awake.

1157
01:03:08,251 --> 01:03:11,152
- Are you cold?
- A little.

1158
01:03:12,755 --> 01:03:15,323
Uh...
Wait. Come here.

1159
01:03:15,325 --> 01:03:16,791
Huh?

1160
01:03:16,859 --> 01:03:18,793
Ooh.

1161
01:03:19,061 --> 01:03:22,997
So, uh, about my friends.
Well...

1162
01:03:22,999 --> 01:03:24,465
I say "friends"...

1163
01:03:24,467 --> 01:03:26,033
They're more like family.

1164
01:03:26,035 --> 01:03:29,270
Anyway, when I was a kid,
it was just me and Sven.

1165
01:03:29,272 --> 01:03:31,839
Until they, you know,
kinda took us in.

1166
01:03:31,841 --> 01:03:33,641
- They did?
- Yeah.

1167
01:03:33,643 --> 01:03:37,509
I don't want to scare you.
They can be a little inappropriate...

1168
01:03:37,552 --> 01:03:40,581
And loud.
Very loud.

1169
01:03:40,583 --> 01:03:43,953
They are also stubborn at times,
and a little overbearing.

1170
01:03:43,987 --> 01:03:46,797
And heavy.
Really, really, heavy.

1171
01:03:46,822 --> 01:03:49,423
But you'll get it.
They mean well.

1172
01:03:49,425 --> 01:03:51,993
Kristoff, they sound
wonderful.

1173
01:03:53,529 --> 01:03:55,463
Okay, then.

1174
01:03:55,765 --> 01:03:58,265
Meet my family.

1175
01:03:58,767 --> 01:04:00,001
Hey, guys.

1176
01:04:00,003 --> 01:04:01,202
They're rocks.

1177
01:04:01,204 --> 01:04:03,938
You are
a sight for sore eyes.

1178
01:04:03,940 --> 01:04:07,008
He's crazy.

1179
01:04:07,010 --> 01:04:08,943
Rocko's looking sharp,
as usual.

1180
01:04:08,945 --> 01:04:12,113
Clay, whoa...
I don't even recognize you.

1181
01:04:12,115 --> 01:04:12,847
You lost so much weight.

1182
01:04:12,849 --> 01:04:15,750
I'll distract him
while you run.

1183
01:04:15,852 --> 01:04:18,319
Hi, Sven's family!

1184
01:04:18,321 --> 01:04:20,588
It's nice to meet you.

1185
01:04:20,590 --> 01:04:23,090
Because I love you,
Anna, I insist you run.

1186
01:04:23,392 --> 01:04:27,595
I understand
you're love experts. Ooh!

1187
01:04:27,597 --> 01:04:29,931
Why aren't you running?

1188
01:04:29,933 --> 01:04:30,932
Uh...

1189
01:04:30,934 --> 01:04:33,234
Okay.
Well, I'm gonna go.

1190
01:04:33,236 --> 01:04:35,803
- Go.
- No, no, no. Anna, wait.

1191
01:04:37,739 --> 01:04:39,140
Kristoff!

1192
01:04:39,442 --> 01:04:41,209
Whoa!

1193
01:04:42,110 --> 01:04:43,411
Hey!

1194
01:04:44,013 --> 01:04:45,680
Kristoff's home!

1195
01:04:46,850 --> 01:04:48,716
Kristoff's here!

1196
01:04:48,718 --> 01:04:49,851
Kristoff's home!

1197
01:04:49,853 --> 01:04:52,320
- Wait, "Kristoff"?
- Uh-huh.

1198
01:04:52,322 --> 01:04:53,821
Ah, let me look at you.

1199
01:04:53,823 --> 01:04:55,389
Take off your clothes,
I wash them.

1200
01:04:55,391 --> 01:04:57,291
No! No, I'm going
to keep my clothes on.

1201
01:04:57,293 --> 01:04:58,893
Look, it's great to see you all,

1202
01:04:58,895 --> 01:05:01,094
- But where's Granpabbie?
- He's napping.

1203
01:05:01,097 --> 01:05:02,797
But look,
I grew a mushroom.

1204
01:05:02,799 --> 01:05:04,732
I earned my fire crystal.

1205
01:05:04,734 --> 01:05:05,966
I passed a kidney stone.

1206
01:05:05,968 --> 01:05:08,803
- Kristoff, pick me up.
- You're getting big.

1207
01:05:08,805 --> 01:05:10,505
Good for you.

1208
01:05:10,507 --> 01:05:13,140
Trolls.
They're trolls!

1209
01:05:15,410 --> 01:05:17,612
He's brought a girl!

1210
01:05:17,614 --> 01:05:18,813
A girl!

1211
01:05:18,815 --> 01:05:20,481
- Whoa!
- Is that a real girl?

1212
01:05:20,483 --> 01:05:23,117
She's like
a little cupcake.

1213
01:05:23,119 --> 01:05:23,751
What's going on?

1214
01:05:23,753 --> 01:05:25,419
I've learned
to just roll with it.

1215
01:05:25,421 --> 01:05:28,088
Let me see.
Bright eyes, working nose,

1216
01:05:28,090 --> 01:05:29,323
strong teeth!

1217
01:05:29,325 --> 01:05:31,859
Yes, yes. She'll do
nicely for our Kristoff.

1218
01:05:31,861 --> 01:05:33,294
Wait, wait, wait.
Oh, um, no.

1219
01:05:33,296 --> 01:05:34,662
No.
You've got the wrong idea.

1220
01:05:34,664 --> 01:05:35,763
No. That's not why
I brought her here.

1221
01:05:35,765 --> 01:05:38,132
Right. We're not...
I'm not...

1222
01:05:38,134 --> 01:05:39,967
What's the issue, dear?

1223
01:05:39,969 --> 01:05:43,037
Why are you holding back
from such a man?

1224
01:05:43,039 --> 01:05:45,239
<i># Is it the clumpy way
he walks?</i>

1225
01:05:45,241 --> 01:05:47,241
<i>- What?
# Or the grumpy way he talks?</i>

1226
01:05:47,243 --> 01:05:51,843
<i>- Oh, no.
# Or the pear-shaped, square-shaped
weirdness of his feet?</i>

1227
01:05:51,981 --> 01:05:53,981
<i># And though we know
he washes well</i>

1228
01:05:53,983 --> 01:05:56,617
<i># He always ends up
sort of smelly</i>

1229
01:05:56,719 --> 01:06:00,585
<i># But you'll never meet a fella
who's as sensitive and sweet</i>

1230
01:06:00,723 --> 01:06:01,888
That's nice, but...

1231
01:06:01,890 --> 01:06:03,890
<i># So, he's a bit
of a fixer-upper</i>

1232
01:06:03,892 --> 01:06:05,626
<i># So, he's got a few flaws</i>

1233
01:06:05,628 --> 01:06:07,027
<i># Like his
peculiar brain, dear</i>

1234
01:06:07,029 --> 01:06:08,462
<i># His thing
with the reindeer</i>

1235
01:06:08,464 --> 01:06:11,265
<i># That's a little outside of nature's laws
- This is not about me!</i>

1236
01:06:11,267 --> 01:06:13,033
<i># So, he's a bit
of a fixer-upper</i>

1237
01:06:13,035 --> 01:06:14,835
<i># But this we're certain of</i>

1238
01:06:14,837 --> 01:06:17,771
<i># You can fix
this fixer-upper up</i>

1239
01:06:17,773 --> 01:06:19,072
<i># With a little bit of love
Um...</i>

1240
01:06:19,074 --> 01:06:21,375
Can we please just stop
talking about this?

1241
01:06:21,377 --> 01:06:23,677
We've got a real,
actual problem, here.

1242
01:06:23,679 --> 01:06:26,547
I'll say.
So, tell me, dear...

1243
01:06:26,549 --> 01:06:28,415
<i># Is it the way
that he runs scared?</i>

1244
01:06:28,417 --> 01:06:30,817
<i># Or that he's
socially impaired?</i>

1245
01:06:30,819 --> 01:06:34,088
<i># Or that he only likes
To tinkle in the woods?</i>

1246
01:06:34,090 --> 01:06:35,289
I don't need to know that.

1247
01:06:35,291 --> 01:06:36,957
<i># Are you holding back
your fondness</i>

1248
01:06:36,959 --> 01:06:39,860
<i># Due to his
unmanly blondness?</i>

1249
01:06:39,862 --> 01:06:44,265
<i># Or the way he covers up
That he's the honest goods?</i>

1250
01:06:44,433 --> 01:06:46,767
<i># He's just a bit
of a fixer-upper</i>

1251
01:06:46,769 --> 01:06:48,001
<i># He's got
a couple of bugs</i>

1252
01:06:48,003 --> 01:06:50,871
<i>- No, I don't!
# His isolation is confirmation</i>

1253
01:06:50,873 --> 01:06:53,441
<i># Of his desperation
for healing hugs.</i>

1254
01:06:53,843 --> 01:06:55,976
<i># So, he's a bit
of fixer-upper</i>

1255
01:06:55,978 --> 01:06:58,245
<i># But we know
what to do</i>

1256
01:06:58,247 --> 01:07:00,747
<i># The way to fix up
this fixer-upper</i>

1257
01:07:00,749 --> 01:07:02,616
<i># Is to fix him up
with you</i>

1258
01:07:02,618 --> 01:07:03,917
Whoa!

1259
01:07:03,919 --> 01:07:05,919
Stop it, stop it, stop it!
Enough!

1260
01:07:05,921 --> 01:07:09,523
She is engaged
to someone else, okay?

1261
01:07:11,927 --> 01:07:14,495
<i># So, she's a bit
of fixer-upper</i>

1262
01:07:14,497 --> 01:07:15,896
<i># That's a minor thing</i>

1263
01:07:15,898 --> 01:07:18,398
<i># Her quote "engagement"
Is a flex arrangement</i>

1264
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:21,101
<i># And by the way,
I don't see no ring</i>

1265
01:07:21,203 --> 01:07:22,937
<i># So, she's a bit
of a fixer-upper</i>

1266
01:07:22,939 --> 01:07:25,673
<i>Hey! Whoa, watch it!
# Her brain's a bit betwixt</i>

1267
01:07:25,675 --> 01:07:27,641
<i># Get the fiance
out of the way</i>

1268
01:07:27,643 --> 01:07:30,478
<i># And the whole thing
will be fixed</i>

1269
01:07:31,847 --> 01:07:33,981
<i># We're not saying
you can change him</i>

1270
01:07:33,983 --> 01:07:36,416
<i># 'Cause people
don't really change</i>

1271
01:07:36,418 --> 01:07:38,953
<i># We're only saying
that love's a force</i>

1272
01:07:38,955 --> 01:07:41,388
<i># That's powerful and strange</i>

1273
01:07:41,490 --> 01:07:43,357
<i># People make bad choices</i>

1274
01:07:43,359 --> 01:07:46,326
<i># If they're mad
or scared or stressed</i>

1275
01:07:46,328 --> 01:07:49,029
<i># But throw
a little love their way</i>

1276
01:07:49,031 --> 01:07:51,198
<i># Throw a little love
their way</i>

1277
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:53,467
<i># And you'll bring
out their best</i>

1278
01:07:53,469 --> 01:07:55,969
<i># True love brings
out the best</i>

1279
01:07:56,071 --> 01:07:58,806
<i># Everyone's a bit
of a fixer-upper</i>

1280
01:07:58,808 --> 01:08:00,907
<i># That's what it's all about</i>

1281
01:08:00,909 --> 01:08:02,275
Father!  Sister!
Brother!

1282
01:08:02,277 --> 01:08:06,011
<i># We need each other to
raise us up and round us out</i>

1283
01:08:06,048 --> 01:08:08,348
<i># Everyone's a bit
of a fixer-upper</i>

1284
01:08:08,350 --> 01:08:11,252
<i># But when push
comes to shove</i>

1285
01:08:11,454 --> 01:08:12,886
<i># The only fixer-upper fixer</i>

1286
01:08:12,888 --> 01:08:14,588
<i># That can fix
a fixer-upper is...</i>

1287
01:08:14,590 --> 01:08:16,190
<i># True, true</i>

1288
01:08:16,292 --> 01:08:18,091
<i># True, true</i>

1289
01:08:18,193 --> 01:08:19,326
<i># True</i>

1290
01:08:19,328 --> 01:08:20,060
<i># Love!</i>

1291
01:08:20,062 --> 01:08:21,561
<i># Love, love, love</i>

1292
01:08:21,563 --> 01:08:22,864
<i># Love
True love</i>

1293
01:08:22,866 --> 01:08:23,964
<i># True</i>

1294
01:08:23,966 --> 01:08:27,902
Do you, Anna, take Kristoff to
be your trollfully wedded...

1295
01:08:27,904 --> 01:08:30,437
- Wait, what?
- You're getting married.

1296
01:08:30,439 --> 01:08:31,339
<i># Love! #</i>

1297
01:08:31,341 --> 01:08:32,674
Anna?

1298
01:08:33,275 --> 01:08:35,276
She's as cold as ice.

1299
01:08:37,079 --> 01:08:39,113
There is strange magic here.

1300
01:08:39,115 --> 01:08:42,483
- Granpabbie.
- Come, come. Bring her
here to me.

1301
01:08:43,885 --> 01:08:46,987
Anna, your life is in danger.

1302
01:08:46,989 --> 01:08:50,457
There is ice in your heart
put there by your sister.

1303
01:08:50,459 --> 01:08:55,897
If not removed,
to solid ice will you freeze, forever.

1304
01:08:55,964 --> 01:08:57,197
What? No.

1305
01:08:57,199 --> 01:08:58,866
But you can
remove it, right?

1306
01:08:58,868 --> 01:09:00,267
I cannot.

1307
01:09:00,369 --> 01:09:02,002
I'm sorry, Kristoff.

1308
01:09:02,004 --> 01:09:04,071
If it was her head,
that would be easy.

1309
01:09:04,073 --> 01:09:10,244
But only an act of true love
can thaw a frozen heart.

1310
01:09:10,445 --> 01:09:11,612
An act of true love?

1311
01:09:11,614 --> 01:09:14,815
A true love's kiss,
perhaps?

1312
01:09:17,552 --> 01:09:20,287
- Something's wrong.
- Are you all right?

1313
01:09:20,289 --> 01:09:22,757
Anna, we've got to get
you back to Hans.

1314
01:09:22,859 --> 01:09:23,791
Hans.

1315
01:09:23,993 --> 01:09:25,860
Pull us out, Sven.

1316
01:09:28,330 --> 01:09:29,496
Olaf, come on!

1317
01:09:29,498 --> 01:09:30,965
I'm coming!

1318
01:09:31,467 --> 01:09:33,834
Let's go kiss Hans!

1319
01:09:33,836 --> 01:09:36,070
Who is this Hans?

1320
01:09:45,280 --> 01:09:47,381
We are here to find
Princess Anna.

1321
01:09:47,483 --> 01:09:51,586
Be on guard, but no harm
is to come to the queen.

1322
01:09:52,954 --> 01:09:55,387
- Do you understand?
- Yes, Your Grace.

1323
01:10:16,745 --> 01:10:18,779
The queen.

1324
01:10:23,351 --> 01:10:26,220
- Go, go!
- Come on!

1325
01:10:28,790 --> 01:10:30,457
There!

1326
01:10:33,261 --> 01:10:34,595
Up there!

1327
01:10:34,697 --> 01:10:36,464
Come on!

1328
01:10:37,866 --> 01:10:39,767
We got her.

1329
01:10:39,769 --> 01:10:41,602
No. Please.

1330
01:10:44,607 --> 01:10:47,207
Go around.
Toss it.

1331
01:10:47,776 --> 01:10:49,276
Stay away!

1332
01:10:49,278 --> 01:10:50,578
Look out!

1333
01:10:51,146 --> 01:10:52,513
Fire! Fire!

1334
01:10:52,748 --> 01:10:54,215
Get her!

1335
01:10:57,019 --> 01:10:58,320
Ah!

1336
01:11:01,657 --> 01:11:03,091
Come on!

1337
01:11:12,702 --> 01:11:14,201
Grab his arm.

1338
01:11:17,406 --> 01:11:19,239
Aim...

1339
01:11:45,201 --> 01:11:47,034
This way, this way!

1340
01:11:47,036 --> 01:11:48,503
Whoa!

1341
01:11:50,472 --> 01:11:51,839
Queen Elsa!

1342
01:11:52,141 --> 01:11:55,542
Don't be the monster
they fear you are.

1343
01:12:41,790 --> 01:12:45,392
Oh, no. What have...
What have I done?

1344
01:12:51,466 --> 01:12:53,404
Why did you bring me here?

1345
01:12:53,436 --> 01:12:55,435
I couldn't just
let them kill you.

1346
01:12:55,537 --> 01:12:58,606
But I'm a danger
to Arendelle. Get Anna.

1347
01:12:58,808 --> 01:13:01,876
Anna has not returned.

1348
01:13:02,577 --> 01:13:04,779
If you would just
stop the winter.

1349
01:13:05,281 --> 01:13:08,282
Bring back summer, please.

1350
01:13:08,684 --> 01:13:10,718
Don't you see?

1351
01:13:10,720 --> 01:13:12,553
I can't.

1352
01:13:15,324 --> 01:13:18,626
You have to tell them
to let me go.

1353
01:13:19,461 --> 01:13:21,963
I will do what I can.

1354
01:13:45,220 --> 01:13:46,587
Just hang in there.

1355
01:13:46,589 --> 01:13:48,422
Come on, buddy, faster!

1356
01:13:54,529 --> 01:13:55,329
Oh, boy!

1357
01:13:55,631 --> 01:13:57,731
Whoa! I'll meet you guys
at the castle!

1358
01:13:57,733 --> 01:13:59,333
Stay out of sight, Olaf.

1359
01:13:59,335 --> 01:14:00,868
I will!

1360
01:14:01,370 --> 01:14:04,305
- Hello!
- Ahh... It's alive!

1361
01:14:13,181 --> 01:14:14,982
It's Princess Anna!

1362
01:14:22,791 --> 01:14:25,326
Are you gonna be okay?

1363
01:14:26,828 --> 01:14:28,729
Don't worry about me.

1364
01:14:28,831 --> 01:14:30,297
Anna!

1365
01:14:30,299 --> 01:14:32,299
- You had us worried sick.
- My Lady.

1366
01:14:32,501 --> 01:14:35,769
Get her warm. And find
Prince Hans, immediately.

1367
01:14:35,771 --> 01:14:37,304
We will.
Thank you.

1368
01:14:37,306 --> 01:14:38,972
Make sure she's safe.

1369
01:14:38,974 --> 01:14:40,640
Oh, you poor girl,
you're freezing.

1370
01:14:40,642 --> 01:14:44,078
Oh, let's get you inside now
and get you warm.

1371
01:14:57,458 --> 01:14:59,526
I'm going back out
to look for Princess Anna.

1372
01:14:59,528 --> 01:15:01,495
You cannot risk going
out there again.

1373
01:15:01,497 --> 01:15:02,996
If anything happens to her...

1374
01:15:02,998 --> 01:15:04,765
If anything happens
to the princess,

1375
01:15:04,767 --> 01:15:07,568
you are all
Arendelle has left.

1376
01:15:09,203 --> 01:15:10,637
He's in here.

1377
01:15:10,639 --> 01:15:11,972
Prince Hans.

1378
01:15:11,974 --> 01:15:14,007
Anna.
You're so cold.

1379
01:15:14,043 --> 01:15:15,542
- Hans, you have to kiss me.
- What?

1380
01:15:15,544 --> 01:15:17,110
- Now! Now!
- Slow down.

1381
01:15:17,112 --> 01:15:19,646
We'll give you two
some privacy.

1382
01:15:19,714 --> 01:15:20,881
What happened out there?

1383
01:15:20,883 --> 01:15:23,050
Elsa struck me with her powers.

1384
01:15:23,052 --> 01:15:24,885
You said she would
never hurt you.

1385
01:15:24,887 --> 01:15:26,153
I was wrong.

1386
01:15:26,155 --> 01:15:27,988
Anna.

1387
01:15:30,159 --> 01:15:31,891
She froze my heart, and

1388
01:15:31,893 --> 01:15:34,728
only an act
of true love can save me.

1389
01:15:36,231 --> 01:15:38,498
A true love's kiss.

1390
01:15:48,142 --> 01:15:49,743
Oh, Anna.

1391
01:15:49,745 --> 01:15:53,914
If only there was someone
out there who loved you.

1392
01:15:53,982 --> 01:15:55,649
What?

1393
01:15:58,686 --> 01:16:00,954
You said you did.

1394
01:16:01,589 --> 01:16:05,389
As thirteenth in line
in my own kingdom,
I didn't stand a chance.

1395
01:16:05,395 --> 01:16:09,195
I knew I would have to marry
into the throne somewhere.

1396
01:16:09,298 --> 01:16:11,064
What... What are you
talking about?

1397
01:16:11,066 --> 01:16:13,767
As heir, Elsa was
preferable, of course.

1398
01:16:13,769 --> 01:16:15,936
But no one was getting
anywhere with her.

1399
01:16:15,938 --> 01:16:16,737
But you...
Hans!

1400
01:16:16,739 --> 01:16:18,905
You were so
desperate for love,

1401
01:16:18,907 --> 01:16:22,042
you were willing
to marry me just like that.

1402
01:16:22,644 --> 01:16:23,977
I figured after we married,

1403
01:16:23,979 --> 01:16:26,780
I would have to stage
a little accident for Elsa.

1404
01:16:26,782 --> 01:16:29,116
Hans!
No. Stop.

1405
01:16:29,218 --> 01:16:31,117
But then,
she doomed herself,

1406
01:16:31,119 --> 01:16:33,253
and you were dumb enough
to go after her.

1407
01:16:33,255 --> 01:16:34,254
Please.

1408
01:16:34,256 --> 01:16:37,591
All that's left now
is to kill Elsa,

1409
01:16:37,659 --> 01:16:39,559
and bring back summer.

1410
01:16:39,561 --> 01:16:41,528
You're no match for Elsa.

1411
01:16:41,530 --> 01:16:44,498
No, you're
no match for Elsa.

1412
01:16:44,632 --> 01:16:45,766
I, on the other hand,

1413
01:16:45,768 --> 01:16:51,371
am the hero who is going to save
Arendelle from destruction.

1414
01:16:51,506 --> 01:16:53,674
You won't get away with this.

1415
01:16:53,875 --> 01:16:55,275
Oh...

1416
01:16:55,410 --> 01:16:57,677
I already have.

1417
01:17:02,650 --> 01:17:04,985
Please, somebody, help.

1418
01:17:08,423 --> 01:17:10,791
Please.
Please.

1419
01:17:12,961 --> 01:17:15,028
It's getting colder
by the minute.

1420
01:17:15,030 --> 01:17:18,398
If we don't do something soon,
we'll all freeze to death.

1421
01:17:19,067 --> 01:17:20,534
Prince Hans.

1422
01:17:20,536 --> 01:17:23,103
Princess Anna is...

1423
01:17:23,471 --> 01:17:25,271
- ... dead.
- What?

1424
01:17:25,474 --> 01:17:27,674
What happened to her?

1425
01:17:31,413 --> 01:17:33,614
She was killed.

1426
01:17:33,616 --> 01:17:35,382
By Queen Elsa.

1427
01:17:35,384 --> 01:17:36,617
No!

1428
01:17:36,619 --> 01:17:38,285
Her own sister.

1429
01:17:38,287 --> 01:17:41,288
At least we got to say
our marriage vows

1430
01:17:42,990 --> 01:17:46,259
before she died
in my arms.

1431
01:17:46,994 --> 01:17:49,029
There can be no doubt now.

1432
01:17:49,031 --> 01:17:52,764
Queen Elsa is a monster,
and we are all in grave danger.

1433
01:17:52,801 --> 01:17:54,601
Prince Hans,

1434
01:17:54,603 --> 01:17:57,170
Arendelle looks to you.

1435
01:17:58,172 --> 01:17:59,139
With a heavy heart,

1436
01:17:59,141 --> 01:18:04,544
I charge Queen Elsa
of Arendelle with treason.

1437
01:18:04,746 --> 01:18:07,614
And sentence her to death.

1438
01:18:19,127 --> 01:18:20,794
Hurry up!

1439
01:18:20,796 --> 01:18:23,828
- She's dangerous.
Move quickly.
- Careful.

1440
01:18:24,233 --> 01:18:26,233
- It won't open!
- It's frozen shut.

1441
01:18:26,235 --> 01:18:27,901
Put your back into it!

1442
01:18:27,903 --> 01:18:29,569
Come on! Push!

1443
01:18:55,264 --> 01:18:56,930
What is it, buddy?

1444
01:18:56,932 --> 01:18:58,799
Hey, watch it.

1445
01:18:58,801 --> 01:19:00,533
What's wrong with you?

1446
01:19:02,937 --> 01:19:05,872
I don't understand you
when you talk like that.

1447
01:19:06,574 --> 01:19:09,142
Stop it!
Put me down!

1448
01:19:10,611 --> 01:19:11,511
No, Sven!

1449
01:19:11,513 --> 01:19:13,346
We're not going back.

1450
01:19:13,348 --> 01:19:15,582
She's with her true love.

1451
01:19:22,190 --> 01:19:23,824
What the...

1452
01:19:25,727 --> 01:19:27,361
Anna!

1453
01:19:33,201 --> 01:19:35,335
Come on!
Come on, boy.

1454
01:19:53,187 --> 01:19:54,821
Help.

1455
01:19:59,293 --> 01:20:01,194
Anna!

1456
01:20:01,729 --> 01:20:03,330
Oh, no.

1457
01:20:14,943 --> 01:20:16,443
Olaf?

1458
01:20:16,445 --> 01:20:18,945
Olaf.
Get away from there.

1459
01:20:19,047 --> 01:20:20,547
Wow!

1460
01:20:20,649 --> 01:20:22,983
So, this is heat.

1461
01:20:22,985 --> 01:20:24,318
I love it.

1462
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:26,653
Ooh! But don't touch it.

1463
01:20:34,561 --> 01:20:37,831
So, where's Hans?
What happened to your kiss?

1464
01:20:37,833 --> 01:20:42,035
I was wrong about him.
It wasn't true love.

1465
01:20:42,237 --> 01:20:43,703
But we ran
all the way here.

1466
01:20:43,705 --> 01:20:47,340
Please, Olaf, you can't
stay here. You'll melt.

1467
01:20:47,342 --> 01:20:51,208
I am not leaving here
until we find some other act
of true love to save you.

1468
01:20:51,579 --> 01:20:53,646
Do you happen
to have any ideas?

1469
01:20:53,648 --> 01:20:55,916
I don't even know
what love is.

1470
01:20:55,918 --> 01:20:58,051
That's okay, I do.

1471
01:20:58,052 --> 01:21:00,019
Love is

1472
01:21:00,121 --> 01:21:02,388
putting someone else's
needs before yours.

1473
01:21:02,390 --> 01:21:08,161
Like, you know, how Kristoff
brought you back here to Hans
and left you forever.

1474
01:21:09,730 --> 01:21:13,499
Kristoff loves me?

1475
01:21:13,767 --> 01:21:18,271
Wow, you really don't know
anything about love, do you?

1476
01:21:18,339 --> 01:21:20,240
Olaf, you're melting.

1477
01:21:20,242 --> 01:21:22,976
Some people
are worth melting for.

1478
01:21:27,382 --> 01:21:30,149
Just maybe
not right this second.

1479
01:21:32,187 --> 01:21:33,954
Don't worry, I've got it.

1480
01:21:36,091 --> 01:21:38,291
We're gonna get through...
Oh, wait.

1481
01:21:38,293 --> 01:21:40,527
Hang on,
I'm getting something.

1482
01:21:41,194 --> 01:21:43,463
It's Kristoff and Sven!

1483
01:21:43,465 --> 01:21:45,531
They're coming
back this way.

1484
01:21:45,633 --> 01:21:46,532
They... They are?

1485
01:21:46,534 --> 01:21:49,769
Wow! He's really moving fast.

1486
01:21:49,771 --> 01:21:53,803
I guess I was wrong.
I guess Kristoff doesn't love you
enough to leave you behind.

1487
01:21:53,809 --> 01:21:55,741
Help me up, Olaf. Please.

1488
01:21:55,743 --> 01:21:59,245
No, no, no!
You need to stay by the fire
and keep warm.

1489
01:21:59,247 --> 01:22:02,548
- I need to get to Kristoff.
- Why?

1490
01:22:03,151 --> 01:22:05,018
Oh, I know why!

1491
01:22:05,020 --> 01:22:07,152
There's your act
of true love right there!

1492
01:22:07,154 --> 01:22:11,525
Riding across the fjords like a
valiant, pungent reindeer king!

1493
01:22:11,527 --> 01:22:12,926
Come on!

1494
01:22:15,062 --> 01:22:16,630
Look out!

1495
01:22:17,132 --> 01:22:18,932
Oh!

1496
01:22:25,073 --> 01:22:27,474
Uh... Back this way.

1497
01:22:28,276 --> 01:22:30,109
We're trapped.

1498
01:22:41,057 --> 01:22:42,957
Oh...

1499
01:22:46,395 --> 01:22:48,295
Whoa!

1500
01:22:51,399 --> 01:22:53,300
Slide, Anna!

1501
01:23:01,944 --> 01:23:03,710
We made it!

1502
01:23:04,278 --> 01:23:06,680
Go, go, go,
go, go, go, go!

1503
01:23:18,960 --> 01:23:20,727
Come on, buddy, faster.

1504
01:23:22,731 --> 01:23:24,565
Kristoff!

1505
01:23:30,137 --> 01:23:32,105
Keep going!

1506
01:23:34,208 --> 01:23:35,909
Kristoff!

1507
01:23:46,955 --> 01:23:48,422
Come on!

1508
01:24:02,537 --> 01:24:04,037
No.

1509
01:24:19,086 --> 01:24:20,620
Whoa!

1510
01:24:27,295 --> 01:24:29,529
Whoa!

1511
01:24:30,398 --> 01:24:32,465
Sven... Sven!

1512
01:24:42,410 --> 01:24:44,011
Good boy.

1513
01:24:55,222 --> 01:24:56,723
Kristoff.

1514
01:24:57,558 --> 01:24:59,960
- Kristoff...
- Anna...

1515
01:25:00,528 --> 01:25:02,062
Anna!

1516
01:25:04,733 --> 01:25:08,802
Elsa! You can't run
from this!

1517
01:25:10,471 --> 01:25:12,772
Just take care
of my sister.

1518
01:25:12,774 --> 01:25:13,807
Your sister?

1519
01:25:13,809 --> 01:25:17,010
She returned from the mountain
weak and cold.

1520
01:25:17,112 --> 01:25:19,446
She said that
you froze her heart.

1521
01:25:19,614 --> 01:25:20,146
No.

1522
01:25:20,148 --> 01:25:23,216
I tried to save her,
but it was too late.

1523
01:25:23,417 --> 01:25:27,020
Her skin was ice.
Her hair turned white.

1524
01:25:27,788 --> 01:25:30,156
Your sister is dead.

1525
01:25:30,358 --> 01:25:32,192
Because of you.

1526
01:25:32,194 --> 01:25:33,693
No.

1527
01:25:55,516 --> 01:25:56,950
Kristoff.

1528
01:25:58,752 --> 01:25:59,986
Anna!

1529
01:26:11,766 --> 01:26:13,567
Elsa?

1530
01:26:21,576 --> 01:26:22,943
No!

1531
01:26:35,322 --> 01:26:36,756
Anna!

1532
01:26:36,991 --> 01:26:39,025
Oh. Anna!

1533
01:26:39,560 --> 01:26:41,628
No, no!

1534
01:26:41,630 --> 01:26:43,597
Please, no.

1535
01:26:51,839 --> 01:26:52,873
Anna?

1536
01:27:34,182 --> 01:27:35,582
Anna?

1537
01:27:38,353 --> 01:27:39,652
Oh, Elsa.

1538
01:27:40,054 --> 01:27:42,789
You sacrificed
yourself for me?

1539
01:27:43,791 --> 01:27:45,158
I love you.

1540
01:27:46,660 --> 01:27:51,197
"An act of true love
will thaw a frozen heart".

1541
01:27:51,899 --> 01:27:54,334
"Love will thaw".

1542
01:27:54,735 --> 01:27:57,370
Love.
Of course.

1543
01:27:57,572 --> 01:27:58,805
Elsa?

1544
01:27:59,207 --> 01:28:01,007
Love!

1545
01:28:46,854 --> 01:28:48,654
I knew you could do it.

1546
01:28:48,656 --> 01:28:52,592
Hands down, this is
the best day of my life.

1547
01:28:52,594 --> 01:28:54,827
And, quite possibly, the last.

1548
01:28:54,829 --> 01:28:57,764
Oh, Olaf!
Hang on, little guy.

1549
01:28:57,366 --> 01:28:59,099
Oh, oh, oh!

1550
01:29:01,202 --> 01:29:04,571
My own personal flurry!

1551
01:29:09,276 --> 01:29:11,511
Uh-uh-uh-uh.

1552
01:29:13,848 --> 01:29:14,881
Anna?

1553
01:29:14,983 --> 01:29:17,082
But she froze your heart.

1554
01:29:17,084 --> 01:29:20,520
The only frozen heart
around here is yours.

1555
01:29:23,992 --> 01:29:25,993
Wonderful!

1556
01:29:39,473 --> 01:29:41,774
Setting course, sir.

1557
01:29:44,211 --> 01:29:46,812
I will return this scoundrel
to his country.

1558
01:29:46,814 --> 01:29:50,817
We shall see what his 12
big brothers think of his behavior.

1559
01:29:50,919 --> 01:29:52,618
Arendelle thanks you, milord.

1560
01:29:52,620 --> 01:29:54,286
This is unacceptable.

1561
01:29:54,288 --> 01:29:57,657
I am a victim of fear.
I've been traumatized.

1562
01:29:57,759 --> 01:29:59,559
Ah! My neck hurts.

1563
01:29:59,561 --> 01:30:03,162
Is there a doctor that
I could see?  No?...

1564
01:30:03,164 --> 01:30:05,531
And I demand
to see the queen!

1565
01:30:05,533 --> 01:30:08,100
Oh. I have a message
from the queen.

1566
01:30:08,102 --> 01:30:09,568
"Arendelle will
henceforth and forever

1567
01:30:09,570 --> 01:30:14,107
"no longer do business
of any sort with Weaseltown".

1568
01:30:14,109 --> 01:30:15,241
"Weselton".

1569
01:30:15,243 --> 01:30:17,009
- It's Weselton!
- Let's go.

1570
01:30:17,011 --> 01:30:19,478
Come on, come on,
come on!

1571
01:30:19,480 --> 01:30:20,713
Okay, okay,
here I come.

1572
01:30:20,815 --> 01:30:23,115
- Pole!
- Whoops! Sorry.

1573
01:30:23,117 --> 01:30:24,784
Okay, okay.

1574
01:30:24,786 --> 01:30:26,686
Here we are.
Oh!

1575
01:30:28,255 --> 01:30:31,223
I owe you a sled.

1576
01:30:33,160 --> 01:30:35,561
- Are you serious?
- Yes!

1577
01:30:35,563 --> 01:30:37,263
And it's the latest model.

1578
01:30:37,265 --> 01:30:38,364
No, I can't accept this.

1579
01:30:38,366 --> 01:30:41,566
You have to. No returns.
No exchanges. Queen's orders.

1580
01:30:41,568 --> 01:30:45,604
She's named you the Official
Arendelle Ice Master and Deliverer.

1581
01:30:45,606 --> 01:30:47,606
- What? That's not a thing.
- Oh, sure it is.

1582
01:30:47,608 --> 01:30:51,077
And it even has a cup holder.
Do you like it?

1583
01:30:51,179 --> 01:30:53,579
Like it?
I love it!

1584
01:30:53,882 --> 01:30:56,683
I could kiss you!

1585
01:30:56,785 --> 01:30:58,985
I could. I mean,
I'd like to. I'd...

1586
01:30:58,986 --> 01:31:01,354
May I? We me.
I mean, may we?

1587
01:31:01,356 --> 01:31:02,989
Wait, what?

1588
01:31:03,290 --> 01:31:05,124
We may.

1589
01:31:07,126 --> 01:31:08,328
Mmm.

1590
01:31:08,496 --> 01:31:10,063
Summer!

1591
01:31:12,699 --> 01:31:14,067
Ooh...

1592
01:31:14,069 --> 01:31:15,569
Hello.

1593
01:31:32,219 --> 01:31:34,219
Are you ready?

1594
01:31:38,525 --> 01:31:40,827
Ice!

1595
01:31:51,805 --> 01:31:53,873
Ooh! Whoo-hoo...

1596
01:31:53,875 --> 01:31:55,675
Swing me.

1597
01:31:56,043 --> 01:31:57,444
Ooh...

1598
01:31:57,646 --> 01:31:59,812
I like the open gates.

1599
01:31:59,814 --> 01:32:02,715
We are never
closing them again.

1600
01:32:04,585 --> 01:32:07,386
Oh, Elsa, they're beautiful,
but you know I don't skate.

1601
01:32:07,388 --> 01:32:09,154
Come on!
You can do it!

1602
01:32:09,456 --> 01:32:11,390
Look out.
Reindeer coming through.

1603
01:32:11,392 --> 01:32:13,592
I got it, I got it.
I don't got it, I don't got it.

1604
01:32:13,594 --> 01:32:15,326
- Hey, guys!
- That's it, Olaf.

1605
01:32:15,563 --> 01:32:19,498
Glide and pivot.
And glide and pivot.

1606
01:32:19,500 --> 01:32:21,333
Go.

1607
01:41:44,164 --> 01:41:45,864
Oh!

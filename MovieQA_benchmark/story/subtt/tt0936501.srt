1
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,600
- Mr. Mills, how are you?
- I'm fine.

2
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:57,760
- How are you?
- Fine.

3
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,400
- I suppose you wanna see it again?
- Lf you don't mind.

4
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,000
- You know where it is.
- Oh, yeah.

5
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:06,440
If I charged you a dollar every time
you came to examine the machine...

6
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:09,480
...you'd probably own it.
It's the one all the pros use.

7
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:12,040
Mariah Carey. Beyoncé. Gwen Stefani.

8
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:14,320
Really? Who's Beyoncé?

9
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,920
Just kidding. I'll take it.

10
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:47,240
Excuse me, sir.
The adult party's in the front.

11
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,800
- I'm Kim's father.
- Excuse me, I work for her father.

12
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,960
- Her real father.
- It's okay, Cyril. I got it.

13
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,120
- Hello, Bryan.
- Lenore.

14
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,880
I just wanted to give Kim her present.

15
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,840
We're letting the kids
have their space.

16
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,840
- Put it with the others.
- I wanna give it to her myself.

17
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,040
- Still having trouble following the rules.
- Oh, come on, Lennie.

18
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,120
- I've asked you not to call me that.
- Excuse me. Lenore.

19
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,680
- Dad!
- Oh, my darling.

20
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,440
- Hi.
- Hello, my sweet.

21
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,960
- Happy birthday.
- I was telling your father...

22
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:18,600
...how we arranged the presents.
- Here.

23
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,480
It's bad manners to open the one...

24
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,440
...and not the others.
- Go on. Open it.

25
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,880
- Cool.
- A karaoke machine?

26
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,200
- Well, I figured she wants to be a singer.
- When she was 12, Bryan.

27
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,720
- We've moved on.
- Thank you, Daddy.

28
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,440
My pleasure.

29
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,560
- I still wanna be a singer. Don't tell Mom.
- You got it.

30
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,400
Here. One for the book.

31
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:42,280
- We have a professional photographer.
- Big smile, sweetie.

32
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,760
That's my girl.

33
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:54,360
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

34
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,200
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

35
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,600
Oh, my... Stuart!

36
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:00,200
Stuart, I love you! I love you!
I love you!

37
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,120
Happy birthday, sweetie.

38
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:16,160
- Oh, Stuart, you're impossible.
- I know.

39
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,880
- Hey, Bryan.
- Stuart.

40
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:21,560
- She's not a little girl anymore, huh?
- I guess not.

41
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:24,840
- Will you join us for lunch?
- No, thanks.

42
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,840
I just wanted to be here
to wish her a happy birthday.

43
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,920
- Good to see you, Bryan.
- You too.

44
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,160
Thanks.

45
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,440
- Hey.
- Hey.

46
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,160
You forgot.

47
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,040
Come on in.

48
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:30,360
It's not like I didn't call to remind you.
Third Saturday in May?

49
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:33,880
- Red meat, red wine? Sound familiar?
- He probably had a lot on his mind.

50
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:37,000
Yeah, the busy life of a retiree.
Every day a new adventure.

51
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:40,480
What does a retiree do, anyway?
Take naps? Play golf?

52
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:43,040
- Hit on rich widows?
- That takes care of the morning.

53
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,600
Yeah, well, come on, guys.
You know why I'm here.

54
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:47,240
Yeah, how's that going?

55
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,160
Okay. We had her birthday today.

56
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,800
Can you believe my Kimmy's 17?

57
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,640
Seventeen?

58
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:57,200
- To Kim.
- Lennie still got a hard-on for you?

59
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,200
She's not Lennie anymore.
She's Lenore.

60
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,920
Oh, she's still got a hard-on.

61
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,400
- And the husband?
- The same. Perfect.

62
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:08,040
- Dig deep enough, there's always shit.
- We can dig if you want us to dig.

63
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,360
What, you think he hasn't
done it already?

64
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,720
Thank you, Bernie.

65
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:14,640
- How's Kimmy?
- Good. She's good.

66
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,840
Yeah? She sleep over yet?

67
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,400
Well, let's say we're working on it.

68
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:23,000
She appreciate the fact
that you've given up your life...

69
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:25,440
...in order to be closer to her?

70
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,560
What a life, huh?

71
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:30,560
Hey, remember Beirut
after the chief disappeared?

72
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,160
Bry was in deep with that
crazy sheik from Hezbollah?

73
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,560
The guy said he'd get us inside
then disappeared.

74
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,560
We're scrambling to get the hell out...

75
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,840
...before we get taken down
and where are you?

76
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,800
I promised never to miss her birthday.

77
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:43,960
Yeah, that went down well
at Langley...

78
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:46,120
...when they found out
you flew the coop...

79
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:49,000
...to attend your child's birthday
9000 miles away.

80
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,000
Where did you say
your next posting was?

81
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,800
The Arctic Circle spying on penguins,
I believe it was.

82
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,560
No, penguins live in Antarctica.

83
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:58,080
Actually, it was Alaska.
What's your point, Sam?

84
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:02,480
My point is we have an open space.
Say the word, it's yours.

85
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,040
Who likes theirs rare?

86
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:07,840
- Guys.
- See you, Bryan.

87
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,120
- Good night, guys.
- See you, Bry.

88
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,320
Hey, look, look, look.
All kidding aside...

89
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:15,480
...it's a great thing trying to make up
for lost time with Kimmy.

90
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:17,440
But tomorrow's job? Right here.

91
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,160
Four hours' work, 2500 bucks...

92
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:22,200
...just for taking some pop diva
to and from her concert.

93
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,800
- We're one short.
- A singer?

94
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:26,880
I don't know if you'd call her a singer.
More like a cash cow.

95
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:29,840
Twenty million records sold already
and she's not even 25.

96
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,200
Job's a piece of cake.

97
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,400
We get her there and back.
Inside, they've got their own people.

98
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,600
- Okay.
- Okay. Okay?

99
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:37,800
- Yeah.
- Like that's it?

100
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,080
Yeah.

101
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:42,880
- It'll be perfect. Just like old times.
- Better. No one gets killed.

102
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:46,360
- Tomorrow. Good night, guys.
- See you.

103
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:49,720
- Get in the back, Wendy.
- I always get in the back.

104
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,440
Ma'am, if you don't mind,
I suggest you keep moving.

105
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,600
My mother is ma'am,
if you don't mind.

106
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:26,680
- Come on, it's time now. Let's go.
- Okay.

107
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:30,760
Bernie, Casey, you're out here.
Bry, you're in the room.

108
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,440
Okay.

109
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:36,120
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

110
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:38,040
Thank you for coming.

111
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,440
Wow, it was beautiful.

112
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,480
Thanks. What did you say
your name was again?

113
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,120
Mills. Bryan Mills.

114
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,880
- Nice to meet you, Bryan Mills.
- You too.

115
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:04,800
- You're on. Come on, let's go now.
- Okay, guys.

116
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:05,960
Excuse me, miss.

117
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:10,400
I've a daughter who wants to be a singer
and was wondering if you had any tips.

118
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:13,080
Yeah, I do.

119
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:15,320
Tell her to pick another career.

120
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,280
I got one.
We're waiting on an air strike...

121
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:23,200
...and we're waiting
and then my satellite phone rings.

122
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,360
- Who is it?
- Hello?

123
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:26,240
- The guy we're to terminate.
- Honey.

124
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:29,320
- He'd like to know if we want some tea.
- Sorry, guys, it's Kim.

125
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,680
The noise?

126
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,880
I'm at a concert.

127
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,960
You know this song? Yeah?

128
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:41,160
Yep, that's her.
No, no, no, I'm not attending.

129
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,720
I'm... I'm not attending.

130
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,400
I'm helping some friends out
with security.

131
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,520
Well, of course I met her.

132
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,280
Who do you think's guarding her?

133
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,520
I'm glad you're impressed.

134
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,800
Hey, I'm happy you called.

135
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,120
I'm happy you called. What?

136
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:59,520
Lunch? Tomorrow?

137
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,160
Sure, sure. I know the place.

138
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:05,480
Twelve-thirty it is.

139
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,520
I'll see you then.

140
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,800
- Here he is. And...?
- What happened?

141
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,720
- She wants to have lunch.
- Okay.

142
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,960
- Just the two of us.
- All right. Fantastic.

143
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,840
See? There's progress. That's great.

144
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,040
Who left that gate open?
Bry, get her out of here. Take the lead.

145
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,280
- Move!
- Go, go!

146
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,840
More security here now!

147
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,600
That's it. Move.

148
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,760
Casey!

149
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,400
Bernie, stand by, stand by.

150
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,520
- Go, go, go.
- Watch your head.

151
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:59,800
Here, take this. The sugar will
take the edge off the shock.

152
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:02,120
Come on, come on, drink some more.

153
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,680
It's okay. It's okay. You're safe.

154
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,880
You're safe now.

155
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,400
Bernie.

156
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:25,440
Casey. Rambo.

157
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,840
Seriously, Bry,
you should think about coming with us.

158
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,480
You've got the edge.
There's more of this to be had.

159
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:33,480
- She's going to college next year?
- Yep.

160
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:36,600
- You're gonna lose her.
- That gives me a year to find her.

161
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:40,040
Mr. Mills, she'd like to see you.

162
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,800
- How are you feeling?
- Better.

163
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:52,200
So your daughter
wants to be a singer?

164
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,360
Yep, since she was 5.

165
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:57,240
It's not what everyone thinks it is.

166
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:02,400
Once the glam wears off, it's just
a lot of hotel rooms, lots of airports.

167
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,000
It's what she wants.

168
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:09,960
The first number is Gio,
my vocal coach.

169
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:12,040
If he says she can sing, she can sing.

170
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,680
He'll give her coaching she needs,
the fee is on me.

171
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,720
The second number is my manager.

172
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:19,360
If Gio clears her,
he'll make sure she gets a shot.

173
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:25,400
- Thank you.
- No, Mr. Mills, thank you.

174
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:43,160
- There she is.
- Dad.

175
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,920
- Hi, sweetie.
- Hey.

176
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,240
- Hi.
- Hi.

177
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,760
Don't look so excited.

178
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:55,200
I was just surprised.
I thought it was just gonna be Kim and I.

179
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:56,920
I asked Mom to come.

180
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:02,440
One raspberry-banana milkshake,
extra cherries, just the way you like it.

181
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:04,000
- Thanks.
- Lennie... Lenore.

182
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,760
- Would you like something?
- I'm fine, thanks.

183
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,680
So?

184
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,640
So, Dad, guess what.

185
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,360
- You know my friend Amanda?
- Yep.

186
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:16,040
Her cousins asked us to spend vacation
with them in Paris.

187
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,240
How cool is that?

188
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,840
- Why do you want to go to Paris?
- Dad. Hello?

189
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,160
The Louvre, the lmpressionist museum,
the Picasso Museum.

190
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:25,120
I didn't know you were so into art.

191
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:28,200
Are you kidding? I've been to the MOMA,
like, a hundred times.

192
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:32,920
Amanda went last summer, she came
back, she could practically speak French.

193
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,640
And because you're under 18...

194
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,520
...you need my permission
to leave the country?

195
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:43,360
Dad, please. I really, really wanna go.

196
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:46,240
They've got this
sick apartment overlooking the river.

197
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,760
- Just you and Amanda?
- And her cousins.

198
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:52,040
Don't make a big deal out of this, Bryan.
Just sign the paper.

199
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:59,200
- What?
- I'm not comfortable with this.

200
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,000
- Dad.
- I know the world, sweetie.

201
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,200
- Dad, please.
- A 17-year-old should not travel alone.

202
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,520
- I'm not gonna be alone.
- Two 17-year-olds.

203
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,600
Amanda's 19.

204
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:16,360
How about this?
How about if I go along?

205
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:19,240
You won't know I'm there.
I'm very good at being invisible.

206
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,600
As you so amply demonstrated
for most of her life.

207
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,280
Just sign the paper, Bryan.

208
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,520
I'll think about it.

209
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:30,760
Everyone at this table
knows what that means.

210
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:34,080
Hey, Kimmy, there's something else.

211
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:37,240
- I don't want anything else.
- Kim.

212
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,840
- I don't get you.
- What?

213
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:48,200
You sacrificed our marriage
in the service of the country.

214
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:51,000
You made a mess of your life
in service of your country.

215
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:53,880
Can't you sacrifice a little
this time for your daughter?

216
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:56,800
- I would sacrifice anything for her.
- What's your problem?

217
00:14:56,960 --> 00:15:00,120
I'm not comfortable
putting my daughter at risk.

218
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:04,120
Putting our daughter at risk
by going to Paris?

219
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,440
You're pathetic.

220
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:23,920
- She's coming.
- Thanks.

221
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,040
Three conditions.

222
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:30,920
The address and phone number
of where you're staying.

223
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:33,920
You move, I wanna know where
and with whom you'll be staying.

224
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:37,480
Call me when you land. Call me
every night before you go to sleep.

225
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,360
It's international. My number is in.

226
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:41,560
- Okay, awesome.
- Kimmy, you're not focused.

227
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:42,920
- I am.
- What did I say?

228
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:46,280
You said call you when I land,
every night before I go to sleep...

229
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:49,160
...your phone's international,
the number's programmed in.

230
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,360
Okay, one last thing.
I get to take you to the airport.

231
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:53,960
Okay.

232
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,640
- There you go.
- Yes.

233
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:00,000
Thank you, Daddy.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

234
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,800
Mom!

235
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:04,760
I love you, Dad.

236
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:08,800
Mom, he signed it, he signed it.
I'm gonna go call Amanda!

237
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:15,040
Wouldn't it have been easier
to sign the first time?

238
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:18,680
Wouldn't it have been easier
if you and I had talked about it first?

239
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:25,560
Certain areas in Paris you should avoid.
I've written them down.

240
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:26,920
- Dad.
- Come on, take it.

241
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:30,720
We're gonna be spending 90 percent
of our time in museums. Don't worry.

242
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:33,480
That's like telling water
not to be wet, sweetie.

243
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,560
Mom says
your job made you paranoid.

244
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,400
Well, my job made me aware.

245
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:42,400
I used to ask Mom what your job was
that you were away all the time.

246
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,800
And she would tell me to ask you.

247
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:48,440
Whenever I did see you,
I was afraid to ask.

248
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,280
Yeah? Why?

249
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,800
I don't know. Maybe because...

250
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:56,520
...I was afraid to find out.

251
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:00,360
Like, maybe it was something
I wouldn't like.

252
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:03,720
I worked for the government.
You knew that.

253
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:08,280
So you were like a spy, right?

254
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:11,760
- What happens if I push this button?
- Don't touch that button.

255
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:17,560
Well, no, I was a...
I was a preventer, actually.

256
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,480
- A preventer?
- Yeah.

257
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,720
What did you prevent?

258
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,800
Bad things from happening.

259
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:28,200
So it was a good job?

260
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:31,040
Yes. Yep, it was.

261
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,840
Do you miss it?

262
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,600
I missed you more.

263
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,280
- Kim!
- Dad, there's Amanda.

264
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,200
Go ahead. I'll get the bags.

265
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,600
- Jimmy'll give you a hand with those.
- I can manage.

266
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,160
Lenore.

267
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:23,040
Do you know about this?
She's not just going to Paris.

268
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,280
- I know.
- She lied to me.

269
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,520
Yes, because she can't be honest
with you.

270
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,640
Why? What are you talking about?

271
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,400
Your rules and conditions.

272
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:32,840
What is this?

273
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,640
It's U2's European tour dates.

274
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,720
She's following a rock band
around Europe?

275
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:41,440
All kids do. Stuart got her tickets,
arranged her to stay in the best hotels.

276
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:44,640
Best hotels. You know,
you live in your little bubble here...

277
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:48,040
...behind your wall, with your maids
and chauffeurs and servants.

278
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,600
No idea what the world is like.

279
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:53,440
Yes, and neither will she
unless she goes out and experiences it.

280
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,400
Don't tell me I don't know the world.

281
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:01,360
For five years I waited for a phone call
that didn't come for weeks at a time.

282
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:04,440
For a knock on the door
telling me there'd be no calls anymore.

283
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:12,320
Listen, I know you moved here to build
some sort of relationship with Kimmy.

284
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,200
But you're not gonna do that
by smothering her.

285
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:18,760
Let her live, or I promise,
I promise you'll lose her.

286
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:26,440
Girls.

287
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,000
Kim!

288
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:39,720
I love you.

289
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,720
Let's go. Come on.

290
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:57,120
I'll teach you the French words
I know.

291
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,720
- Which may not be that much, but...
- Okay. Yeah, right.

292
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:06,440
Three. Okay, now take one...

293
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,520
Need some help?
One with the two of you?

294
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:10,920
Yes, please.

295
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:13,000
- Okay.
- He's really cute.

296
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,840
Okay. Yeah, great. Very nice.

297
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Where are you from?

298
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:19,120
California.

299
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:25,800
No. I'm Peter.

300
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,160
- This is Kim.
- Hi.

301
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:34,440
- Nice to meet you.
- Hi.

302
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,000
Hey.

303
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:38,520
You're going into Paris?

304
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:41,520
You know, taxis here
are so damned expensive.

305
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:42,760
Want to share?

306
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,680
- Yeah. Sure.
- Okay, perfect.

307
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:46,600
Thanks.

308
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:51,520
<i>To check arrivals,
please press one.</i>

309
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:54,080
<i>Please enter the flight number.</i>

310
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:59,400
<i>Flight 288 arrived
in Paris Charles de Gaulle...</i>

311
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:02,920
<i>... at 8 a.m. Local time.</i>

312
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:05,480
Yeah.

313
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:08,000
Oh, are you serious?

314
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,400
- Oh, my God.
- Nice address.

315
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:11,880
Oh, yeah, thanks.

316
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:16,000
It's my cousins', but they're in Madrid,
so we have the whole place to ourselves.

317
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,640
How cool is that?

318
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:20,360
- I didn't know that.
- It's no biggie.

319
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,440
Well, I have to be going.

320
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,280
- Nice to meet you.
- Oh, okay.

321
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:25,480
- You too.
- Bye.

322
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:27,560
Hey.

323
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:31,000
There is a party tonight at school.
Want to come?

324
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,840
- Sure. Yeah.
- We don't even know him.

325
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,080
What is there to know? He's hot.

326
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,320
- I come pick you up around 9?
- Okay, yeah.

327
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:39,400
Okay, great. Your apartment?

328
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:43,040
- It's the whole fifth floor. Hoffmann.
- Okay. See you tonight. Bye.

329
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,760
Bye.

330
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:53,880
Yeah.

331
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:55,800
Fifth floor.

332
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:58,520
Two girls around 18.

333
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:02,720
Oh, my God.

334
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,880
- How sick is this?
- Are you kidding me? It's great.

335
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:08,800
I just wish you would've told me
they weren't gonna be here.

336
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,520
- What's the difference?
- I told my dad they'd be here.

337
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:13,880
You told your dad you were
going to museums too.

338
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:15,800
Oh, come on. He's not gonna know.

339
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,680
- I'm gonna sleep with him.
- Who?

340
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:20,280
- Peter.
- You just met him.

341
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:23,680
I hear French guys are amazing in bed.

342
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:26,120
- Maybe he has a friend, huh?
- No.

343
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:27,400
- No.
- Oh, come on.

344
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:31,240
You gotta lose it sometime.
Might as well be in Paris.

345
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:36,680
Hey!

346
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,760
- Amanda, where's the bathroom?
- What?

347
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:58,960
I have to pee!

348
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:26,040
- Hello?
- It's me. Has Kim called you?

349
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:30,840
Bryan, she's 17. She's in Paris.
Give her some space.

350
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,160
<i>She'll call. Take a sleeping pill.</i>

351
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,400
Have a drink or something. Good night.

352
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:38,080
Good night.

353
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:54,560
Hi, Daddy.

354
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:57,160
Kim.

355
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:01,120
What did I say?
You were supposed to call me.

356
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,280
I'm sorry.

357
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:04,600
<i>I thought something was wrong
with the phone.</i>

358
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:07,360
- No. It was such a rush at the airport.
- All right.

359
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:10,080
Well, if I'd had the number
where you were staying...

360
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,840
<i>... I would've just called there.</i>

361
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
<i>What's the number?</i>

362
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,680
<i>- I don't have it.
- Kimmy, come on.</i>

363
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:18,520
<i>This is one of the conditions.
Let me talk to the cousins.</i>

364
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:20,280
<i>I'll get it from them.</i>

365
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:23,960
Dad, they're in Spain.
I didn't know. I swear.

366
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:26,120
To Spain?

367
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:30,640
Kim, is there anything else
you want to tell me?

368
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:35,720
Kimmy.

369
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:42,400
- There's someone here.
- The cousins are back?

370
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:44,200
No.

371
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,320
- Oh, my God. They got Amanda.
- What?

372
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,960
<i>What are you talking about? Kimmy?</i>

373
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:51,320
<i>- Dad.
- Kim.</i>

374
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:55,080
<i>- Kim.
- Dad. They took her.</i>

375
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:57,440
<i>- They took her.
- All right, listen to me.</i>

376
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,000
Oh, God.

377
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:01,640
- Did you meet anyone on the plane?
- No.

378
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:04,760
- In the airport?
- No. Yes, Peter.

379
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,520
<i>- Peter? Peter who?
- I don't know.</i>

380
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:07,800
<i>- An American?
- No.</i>

381
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,920
Did he know where you were staying?

382
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,520
He took a cab with us.

383
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,960
Dad, they're coming.

384
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:20,040
<i>- Please, I'm scared.
- I know you are.</i>

385
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:22,440
Stay focused, Kimmy.
You have to hold it together.

386
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,120
How many people are there?

387
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:26,680
- Three, four. I don't know.
- Where are you?

388
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,600
- I'm in the bathroom.
- Go to the next bedroom.

389
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:33,320
Get under the bed.
Tell me when you're there.

390
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:44,680
- I'm here.
- Now, the next part is very important.

391
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:51,560
They are going to take you.
Kim, stay focused, baby. This is key.

392
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:55,080
You will have five, maybe ten seconds.
Very important seconds.

393
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:57,640
<i>Leave the phone on the floor.
Concentrate.</i>

394
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:01,720
Shout out everything you see about them.
Hair color, eye color, tall, short, scars.

395
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:04,160
Anything you see. You understand?

396
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,320
They're there. I can hear them.

397
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,240
<i>Remember, concentrate.</i>

398
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:25,560
Put the phone closer so I can hear.

399
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:52,680
They're leaving. I think they're...

400
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:01,120
<i>Beard. Six feet.
Tattoo right hand, moon and star.</i>

401
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:23,320
I don't know who you are.

402
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,600
I don't know what you want.

403
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:30,560
If you are looking for a ransom,
I can tell you, I don't have money.

404
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:34,960
But what I do have
are a very particular set of skills.

405
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:37,800
Skills I've acquired
over a very long career.

406
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,680
Skills that make me a nightmare
for people like you.

407
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:45,440
If you let my daughter go now,
that'll be the end of it.

408
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:49,320
I will not look for you.
I will not pursue you.

409
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:53,120
But if you don't, I will look for you.

410
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:55,880
I will find you...

411
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:58,280
...and I will kill you.

412
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,880
<i>Good luck.</i>

413
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,680
Sam, it's me. I need a favor.

414
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:20,800
I'm gonna download something.
I need it analyzed. Right now.

415
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,080
- She's been taken.
- What?

416
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:25,480
- Any enemies overseas?
- Why would I have enemies?

417
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:28,440
You do business overseas
through multiple shell corporations.

418
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:32,040
You were involved in an oil deal with
a bunch of Russians that went south.

419
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:34,920
- How do you know that?
- I was not gonna let my daughter...

420
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:37,800
...live with someone without knowing
everything about them.

421
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:41,000
- I have a few resources...
- Now is not the time for dick measuring.

422
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:43,240
- Anyone looking to hurt you?
- Not that I know.

423
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:45,280
- Which room's Kim's?
- What happened?

424
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:48,800
I got a call from her. There were people
in the apartment. She was taken.

425
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,280
- Oh, God.
- Which one?

426
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:52,000
That one.

427
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:57,760
Is there something I should be doing?

428
00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:00,720
You have a lease agreement
with NetJet through your company.

429
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,360
I do.

430
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:04,640
- Get me a plane to Paris.
- For when?

431
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:05,880
An hour ago.

432
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:09,320
- I'm gonna make the call. You all right?
- Yeah, yeah. I'm okay.

433
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:20,960
Would you please
get her back to me, Bryan?

434
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:22,760
First I have to find her.

435
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:29,400
Sam, what have you got?

436
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:30,760
<i>They're speaking Albanian.</i>

437
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:34,200
Based on their accents and dialects,
they must be from Tropoja.

438
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:36,120
<i>The place is ground zero
for scummers.</i>

439
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:38,440
<i>Even the Russians
give these guys a wide berth.</i>

440
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:41,280
The one you spoke to,
his name is Marko.

441
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,360
We have information
that a mobster boss...

442
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:46,600
...by the name of Marko Hoxha
moved to Paris about six months ago.

443
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:52,280
<i>If he's the one, he's a big fish.
The tattoo, by the way, is a group ID.</i>

444
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:55,240
<i>- Am I on speaker or are you by yourself?
- Lenore is here.</i>

445
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:58,520
<i>- Hey, Lennie.
- Hello, Sam.</i>

446
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,040
She needs to hear it, Sam.

447
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:04,800
The specialty of the groups coming out
of this area is trafficking in women.

448
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:10,360
- Keep going.
- Okay.

449
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:15,080
Their previous m.o. Was to offer women
from emerging East European countries...

450
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:19,160
<i>... like Yugoslavia, Romania, Bulgaria,
jobs in the West as maids and nannies.</i>

451
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:23,600
Once smuggled in, they'd addict them
to drugs and turn them into prostitutes.

452
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,800
Lately, however, they've decided
that it's more economical...

453
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:32,640
...just to kidnap traveling young women.
Saves on transportation costs.

454
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:35,080
Oh, my little baby.

455
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:36,760
What else?

456
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,880
Based on the way these groups operate,
our analyst says...

457
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:42,760
...you have a 96-hour window
from the time she was grabbed.

458
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:45,320
- To what?
- To never finding her.

459
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:48,440
No, no, no.

460
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:50,200
<i>Daddy!</i>

461
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:54,440
<i>Mustache. Six feet.
Tattoo on right hand, moon and star.</i>

462
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,200
<i>Da...</i>

463
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:04,640
<i>Good luck.</i>

464
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,080
<i>Good luck.</i>

465
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,160
<i>Good luck.</i>

466
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:14,920
<i>Good luck.</i>

467
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:51,480
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

468
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:55,240
<i>Dad, they got Amanda.</i>

469
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:06,880
<i>Oh, God.</i>

470
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:10,760
<i>Dad, they got her.</i>

471
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:14,600
<i>They took her.</i>

472
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:16,960
<i>Go to the next bedroom.
Get under the bed.</i>

473
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:20,360
<i>- Tell me when you're there.
- I'm here.</i>

474
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:28,920
<i>Stay focused, baby.
Leave the phone on the floor.</i>

475
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:31,480
<i>Concentrate. Shout out
everything you see about them.</i>

476
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:35,360
<i>Hair color, eye color, tall, short, scars.
Anything you see. You understand?</i>

477
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:38,360
<i>They're there. I can hear them.
Remember, concentrate.</i>

478
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:53,800
<i>They're leaving. Daddy!</i>

479
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:57,800
<i>Dad!</i>

480
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:02,040
Beard. Six feet.
Tattoo right hand, moon and star.

481
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,760
Dad!

482
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:42,440
- Hi.
- Hi.

483
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,200
- I'm Peter.
- I'm Ingrid.

484
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:45,600
- On holidays?
- Yes.

485
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,400
- Me too.
- Cool.

486
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:49,920
Cabs here are so damned expensive.
Want to share?

487
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:52,320
- Sure. Why not?
- Great.

488
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:56,360
- Excuse me.
- Hey.

489
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:00,040
- Hey.
- Drive.

490
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:05,120
- The two American girls from yesterday?
- I don't know.

491
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:09,720
The next rib drives into your lungs.
The two American girls, where are they?

492
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:09,400
- Just like the old days.
- Would you have it any other way?

493
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:10,920
Between you and me? No.

494
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:14,280
But now that I sit behind a desk,
the world looks different.

495
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:16,680
- You mean, looks boring.
- I mean different.

496
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:21,000
Okay, a little boring. But is being retired
any more interesting?

497
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:24,440
It wasn't. Until my daughter
disappeared in Paris yesterday.

498
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:28,360
She and her friend were marked by a
spotter at the airport. Albanians took her.

499
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:30,760
- How do you know this?
- I'm retired, not dead.

500
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:33,560
And I assume you don't want
to go to the police.

501
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:36,360
I was told I have 96 hours.
That was 16 hours ago.

502
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:40,320
- Okay, first, we should find the spotter.
- I found him, he's dead.

503
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:44,920
You found him that way?

504
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:50,720
Bryan, you cannot just run around
tearing down Paris...

505
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,960
I'll tear down the Eiffel Tower
if I have to.

506
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:55,680
- Don't forget who you talk to.
- I'm talking to a friend.

507
00:38:55,840 --> 00:39:00,680
You are. But please remember,
your friend has a desk now.

508
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:04,200
"Deputy director, Internal Security."
Very impressive.

509
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:06,280
The Albanians?

510
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:09,240
They showed up from the East,
six, seven years ago.

511
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:11,680
Fifteen, 20 of them.
Now there are hundreds.

512
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:14,440
We don't even know how many.
And dangerous.

513
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:17,200
So I heard. Where do I find them?

514
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:23,400
The best place to start is Porte de Clichy.
Bryan, try not to make a mess.

515
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,700
I need an agent to follow someone

516
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:49,920
Little Red Riding Hood said to the wolf,
"Grand-ma! What big arms you have!"

517
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:54,000
- and the wolf replied, "it's for...."
- Jean-Claude , its your assistant

518
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:02,160
Yes?
He visited a branch of Interim and rented a car

519
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:04,800
- That's all?
- Yes it is rather quiet

520
00:40:04,810 --> 00:40:06,400
With him it does not take long, don't be fooled.

521
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:26,600
- Gregor Milocivic?
- Yes. Yes, I am Gregor.

522
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:29,000
I'm Mr. Smith. Get in.

523
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:34,880
Here is my résumé.

524
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:37,720
The employment agency said
we would be doing translations.

525
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:40,680
Yes. Albanian to English.
You do speak Albanian?

526
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:43,880
Albanian, Serbian, Croatian.
I was a teacher in primary school...

527
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:46,680
...before the war began in Pristina...
- What's your rate?

528
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:48,040
My rate?

529
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:51,240
It is 25 per hour for the first three hours
and then it goes up...

530
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:55,080
Okay. Now, here's for 10 hours.
Wait here.

531
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:59,520
Mr. Smith, I do not understand.
What is the job exactly?

532
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:01,920
Right now the job is to wait here.

533
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:11,000
Good evening.

534
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:15,040
- Hi. Looking for a date?
- I love your dress. Is that silk?

535
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:17,320
I don't know.
You want to know the prices?

536
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,320
Just the way it falls, it must be silk.

537
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:22,680
How it compliments
the natural curves of your body.

538
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:24,840
The rate is 40 euros for the standard.

539
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,720
Standard? Could you be more specific?

540
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:29,440
Back home, the standard covers
a range of possibilities.

541
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:31,880
Like kissing,
you know, closed lips, open lips.

542
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:34,880
- Lf you're not buying, piss off.
- I didn't say I wasn't buying.

543
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:37,120
I like to get comfortable
before I purchase.

544
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:39,080
Like this karaoke machine I bought.

545
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:42,760
I must have read that manual
from cover to cover so many times.

546
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:46,240
I don't give a shit. You're gonna
get me in trouble if you don't buy.

547
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:48,520
- Trouble? Really? With who?
- Piss off.

548
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:51,240
Okay, okay. Listen, I'm sorry.

549
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:54,520
If I want a package deal,
do I get a discount?

550
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:58,240
- You cost me two now.
- My name's Bryan.

551
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:01,960
- Oh, God. You better leave.
- I thought we were negotiating.

552
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:04,600
Anton, I swear, it's not my fault.

553
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:07,480
- I told him...
- Why are you bothering the girl?

554
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:09,880
- None of your business.
- She is my business.

555
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:12,520
And if you're not spending money,
you're costing money.

556
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:15,400
- I was negotiating.
- No negotiating. Price is the price.

557
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:17,400
Now you owe me
for two that got away.

558
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:19,680
I don't owe you nothing.

559
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:24,200
- Fifty euros or I kick your ass.
- Sure, sure, okay.

560
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:26,040
Chill.

561
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:31,720
Okay. Here's your 50.

562
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:36,320
And another 50 for being an asshole.
Now get the hell out of here.

563
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:39,080
If I see you again, I'll kill you.

564
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:48,440
Mr. Smith, I do not know what kind of
job I'm supposed to do for you, but...

565
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:51,400
- You are to translate.
- Yes. But translate what?

566
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:53,400
This.

567
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:01,760
Translate.

568
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:05,240
- They're talking about you.
- What about me?

569
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:07,960
- They're not saying nice things.
- Be specific.

570
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:11,440
They're saying... Excuse me, Mr. Smith.
- What an asshole you are.

571
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,520
Please, if you can explain to me
why we're doing this...

572
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:17,280
Just translate.

573
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:20,160
One of them says,
the sausage gave him heartburn.

574
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:21,480
Keep going.

575
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:25,920
The other one is suggesting something
his grandmother used to give him.

576
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:29,400
- Do you really want to hear all this?
- Every word.

577
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:34,400
Now they're talking about football.
The game between Lazio and Marseille.

578
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:36,360
And they lost money on the betting.

579
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:40,920
- Perhaps if I knew the purpose...
- You're better off not knowing.

580
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:43,240
Is it still football?

581
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:45,320
One is on the phone.

582
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:47,680
He has to do a job
at the construction site.

583
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:50,720
Something about fresh merchandise
giving problems.

584
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:53,160
Mr. Smith,
I do not understand any of this.

585
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:56,160
You're not supposed to. Goodbye.

586
00:43:57,320 --> 00:44:01,000
I asked for an English-Albanian
dictionary, did you bring one?

587
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:04,320
Thank you.

588
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,960
- It's sorted
- Really?

589
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:34,640
- Are you busy tonight?
- Of course

590
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:39,520
I love you.

591
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:56,560
Where did you get this?

592
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:58,720
Where did you get this?

593
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:01,760
- I'm good.
- Who gave this to you?

594
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,960
- Who...? Who gave this to you?
- I'm good.

595
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:09,880
Hey.

596
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:34,440
Hey.

597
00:46:41,020 --> 00:46:42,440
Lets go!

598
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:49,920
Come on.

599
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,680
I told you he wouldn't stay quiet for long

600
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:28,800
OK so what do we do now?

601
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:32,840
Now that he's started this mess
it wont be long before you're finished!

602
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:49,840
Oh shit!

603
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:23,240
Monsieur Allen, how are you?

604
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:25,160
Hello, Gilles. How's the wife?

605
00:50:25,360 --> 00:50:26,840
Well, still in charge.

606
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,640
- Been a long time since I've seen you.
- Way too long.

607
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:32,160
- The usual accommodation?
- Plus one.

608
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:15,560
Yes?

609
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:18,200
<i>- We need to talk.
- I'm listening.</i>

610
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:22,200
Well, can't you come
and meet me first?

611
00:52:22,360 --> 00:52:23,920
I can't see you. Where are you?

612
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:26,760
I can see you and hear you very well.

613
00:52:27,560 --> 00:52:29,800
You can tell them
to stop jogging now.

614
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:37,520
It's good , we've got his cell phone's signal.

615
00:52:37,720 --> 00:52:39,840
Didn't think
I was gonna come down, did you?

616
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,200
I didn't think you were gonna
make such a mess.

617
00:52:42,360 --> 00:52:44,320
I didn't have time to worry
about neatness.

618
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:47,480
<i>- I know. You have 70 hours.
- Now I have 56.</i>

619
00:52:49,120 --> 00:52:50,720
No, now you have none.

620
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:53,960
My chief wanted to arrest you,
I convinced him to send you home.

621
00:52:54,760 --> 00:52:59,400
<i>Air France 001 leaves today at 2.
First class.</i>

622
00:52:59,560 --> 00:53:02,400
Courtesy of the French government
for past services rendered.

623
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:08,920
- And what about my daughter?
- I told you, I sit behind a desk now.

624
00:53:09,080 --> 00:53:12,320
<i>I take my orders from someone
who sits behind a bigger desk.</i>

625
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:16,000
Come on, seven dead bodies,
three in hospital, a building destroyed.

626
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:17,440
<i>Total chaos at the airport.</i>

627
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:20,800
He wanted your ass in chains.
It's the best I could do, I'm sorry.

628
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:23,480
Sorry doesn't cut it, Jean-Claude.
Not this time.

629
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,320
You can't beat the state, Bryan.
You know that.

630
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:31,840
I'm not trying to.
I'm trying to save my daughter.

631
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:33,640
It was a trailer, not a building.

632
00:54:12,360 --> 00:54:13,760
No, no, no. Leave it.

633
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:16,280
It's all right, it's fluids.

634
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:18,360
And medication
to counteract the drugs.

635
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:20,360
It's all right.

636
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:24,320
Where'd you get this?

637
00:54:25,120 --> 00:54:27,160
Where did you get this jacket?

638
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:29,440
Did you get it from her?

639
00:54:30,080 --> 00:54:31,960
Was it from this girl?

640
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:35,800
I didn't steal it.

641
00:54:35,960 --> 00:54:39,480
- I was cold, she gave it to me.
- Where? Where did she give it to you?

642
00:54:41,080 --> 00:54:43,480
- In the house.
- What house?

643
00:54:44,600 --> 00:54:46,200
The house with the red door.

644
00:54:49,080 --> 00:54:50,360
Sorry.

645
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:58,280
He said it was a party.

646
00:54:59,320 --> 00:55:01,600
The girl who gave you this,
was she in the house?

647
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:08,160
She was nice.

648
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:09,760
I know.

649
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:12,120
She's my daughter.

650
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:19,680
I need to find this house.
Do you know where it is?

651
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:27,200
Paradise.

652
00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:44,280
- Good morning.
- May I help you?

653
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:46,480
- I'm here to see your boss.
- No boss.

654
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:53,800
We're doing nothing wrong here.

655
00:55:55,160 --> 00:55:57,000
One button,
and 30 agents will be here...

656
00:55:57,160 --> 00:55:59,360
...before you have time
to scratch your balls.

657
00:55:59,560 --> 00:56:02,680
Stop jerking around before
I close you down for wasting my time.

658
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:09,600
Wait here.

659
00:56:21,880 --> 00:56:22,840
You have weapon?

660
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:24,400
You're holding it.

661
00:56:51,800 --> 00:56:53,240
Black, one sugar, please.

662
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:01,240
What is it you want?

663
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:04,280
I'm here to negotiate the rates.

664
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:07,520
We already negotiated the rate
with Mr. Macon.

665
00:57:07,720 --> 00:57:10,720
Mr. Macon has moved
to another division.

666
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:12,640
I'm here for the renegotiation.

667
00:57:16,360 --> 00:57:19,800
Unless you think I'm being unreasonable,
let me explain ourselves.

668
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:24,640
Nice coffee. We have you under
satellite surveillance, 24 hours a day.

669
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:28,320
We hear everything you say,
we know everything you do.

670
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:31,680
Do you have any idea what it costs
just to change the angle...

671
00:57:31,840 --> 00:57:35,160
...of the lens on a satellite
orbiting 200 miles above the Earth?

672
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:36,840
And those costs have gone up.

673
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:40,120
Our costs go up, your costs go up.
It's only logical.

674
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,240
By the way,
which one of you is Marko?

675
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:45,120
Why do you want to know?

676
00:57:45,320 --> 00:57:46,760
I was told Marko is in charge.

677
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:48,640
We are all Marko.

678
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:51,160
Marko from Tropoja.

679
00:57:51,320 --> 00:57:52,520
We are all from Tropoja.

680
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:58,400
If that's the game you want to play,
the rate just went up 10 percent.

681
00:57:58,560 --> 00:58:02,600
If you are trying to extort us because
we are immigrants, we know the law.

682
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,400
I'm extorting you because
you are breaking the law.

683
00:58:05,560 --> 00:58:07,960
Which charge would you
like to be arrested for?

684
00:58:08,120 --> 00:58:11,000
Drugs, kidnapping, prostitution?
Take your pick.

685
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:13,640
You come to this country,
take advantage of it...

686
00:58:13,840 --> 00:58:16,760
...and think because we are tolerant,
we are weak and helpless.

687
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:18,720
Your arrogance offends me.

688
00:58:18,920 --> 00:58:20,800
For that,
the rate went up 10 percent.

689
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:24,920
Now, do you want to get down
to business or to keep playing?

690
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:28,520
- How much?
- Twenty percent.

691
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:31,360
And you have my word it'll not go up
for a year.

692
00:58:34,460 --> 00:58:35,420
Give me the tin

693
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:43,000
How do you say "sugar"
in your language?

694
00:58:55,800 --> 00:58:57,920
You've made a very good investment,
gentlemen.

695
00:58:58,120 --> 00:58:59,200
See you in a month.

696
00:59:03,960 --> 00:59:07,000
A friend gave this to me.
It's Albanian. You mind translating it?

697
00:59:18,840 --> 00:59:20,440
Good luck.

698
00:59:20,840 --> 00:59:21,920
<i>- Good luck.
- Good luck.</i>

699
00:59:22,680 --> 00:59:24,400
<i>- Good luck. Good luck.
- Good luck.</i>

700
00:59:33,880 --> 00:59:35,520
You don't remember me.

701
00:59:36,280 --> 00:59:38,200
We spoke on the phone
two days ago.

702
00:59:41,600 --> 00:59:43,000
I told you I would find you.

703
01:00:45,320 --> 01:00:46,360
Kim.

704
01:01:00,120 --> 01:01:01,640
Amanda.

705
01:01:36,120 --> 01:01:37,120
Wake up!

706
01:01:37,640 --> 01:01:39,320
I need you to be focused.

707
01:01:42,360 --> 01:01:44,160
Are you focused yet?

708
01:01:53,600 --> 01:01:54,720
Where is this girl?

709
01:01:55,320 --> 01:01:56,960
Where is she?

710
01:02:24,360 --> 01:02:28,000
You know, we used to outsource
this kind of thing.

711
01:02:28,200 --> 01:02:30,720
But what we found was the countries
we outsourced to...

712
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:34,120
...had unreliable power grids.
Very Third World.

713
01:02:34,280 --> 01:02:36,520
You'd turn on a switch,
power wouldn't come on...

714
01:02:36,680 --> 01:02:40,520
...and then tempers would get short.
People would resort to pulling fingernails.

715
01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:42,920
Acid drips on bare skin.

716
01:02:43,120 --> 01:02:45,440
The whole exercise
would become counterproductive.

717
01:02:45,600 --> 01:02:47,200
But here, the power's stable.

718
01:02:47,360 --> 01:02:49,600
Here, there's a nice even flow.

719
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:52,920
Here, you can flip a switch
and the power stays on all day.

720
01:02:56,840 --> 01:02:58,120
Where is she?

721
01:03:18,200 --> 01:03:22,000
Now, I don't have any more time
to waste, Marko from Tropoja.

722
01:03:22,440 --> 01:03:24,640
Give me what I need
or this switch'll stay on...

723
01:03:24,800 --> 01:03:27,640
...till they turn power off
for lack of payment on the bill.

724
01:03:28,840 --> 01:03:30,080
Where is my daughter?

725
01:03:30,600 --> 01:03:33,880
We don't keep virgins, we sell them.

726
01:03:34,120 --> 01:03:36,160
She was virgin, lot of money.

727
01:03:36,360 --> 01:03:38,400
You sold my daughter? You sold her?

728
01:03:40,360 --> 01:03:41,920
To who?

729
01:03:42,600 --> 01:03:44,160
I don't know.

730
01:03:46,520 --> 01:03:48,320
- What?
- Saint-Clair.

731
01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:49,760
Saint-Clair.

732
01:03:50,200 --> 01:03:52,640
Saint-Clair? Saint-Clair.
Is that a person, a place?

733
01:03:54,200 --> 01:03:57,080
Person. Patrice Saint-Clair.

734
01:03:57,280 --> 01:03:58,240
Patrice Saint-Clair.

735
01:03:59,400 --> 01:04:00,640
Where can I find him?

736
01:04:01,600 --> 01:04:03,360
I don't know, I don't know.

737
01:04:04,120 --> 01:04:06,720
I don't know. I don't know.
I don't know.

738
01:04:06,920 --> 01:04:09,080
Please! I don't know!

739
01:04:09,240 --> 01:04:13,080
I don't know! No! Please! Please.

740
01:04:13,240 --> 01:04:15,000
Please.

741
01:04:15,160 --> 01:04:17,160
Not that. Please.

742
01:04:17,320 --> 01:04:18,680
I believe you.

743
01:04:21,400 --> 01:04:23,560
But it's not gonna save you.

744
01:04:37,800 --> 01:04:40,360
- I'm home
- Daddy!

745
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,920
- Good evening my loves
- Daddy

746
01:04:44,360 --> 01:04:46,600
The chicken smells good
I can smell it from the street!

747
01:04:45,800 --> 01:04:47,560
Look who dropped by.

748
01:04:48,360 --> 01:04:50,840
Bryan, what a pleasant surprise.

749
01:04:51,040 --> 01:04:52,000
Jean-Claude.

750
01:04:52,200 --> 01:04:54,560
The children waited up for you.

751
01:04:54,720 --> 01:04:57,920
If you tuck them in, maybe we can eat
before everything gets cold.

752
01:04:58,080 --> 01:04:59,520
Bryan, will you do the honors?

753
01:04:59,720 --> 01:05:01,560
- Sure.
- I'll be just a minute.

754
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:05,400
- Children, bed time
- Oh...
- Thank you

755
01:05:30,840 --> 01:05:32,920
I was just telling Bryan
how nice it's been...

756
01:05:33,080 --> 01:05:35,160
...since you left the old job
for the new one.

757
01:05:35,320 --> 01:05:38,040
Home every night for dinner,
get to see the kids more.

758
01:05:38,200 --> 01:05:41,120
Yeah, must be nice coming home
every night, seeing your kids.

759
01:05:41,320 --> 01:05:43,320
Bryan has been thinking
about relocating.

760
01:05:43,720 --> 01:05:45,120
- Really?
- Yes.

761
01:05:45,320 --> 01:05:47,040
To Paris, he's been visiting houses.

762
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:49,760
- White or dark meat?
- Dark, please.

763
01:05:49,920 --> 01:05:51,200
Find anything interesting?

764
01:05:51,360 --> 01:05:55,000
As a matter of fact, I did, in the 10th
arrondissement on Rue Paradis.

765
01:05:55,880 --> 01:05:58,240
People there know someone
that works in your office.

766
01:05:58,480 --> 01:06:00,360
A Mr. Macon. Do you know him?

767
01:06:00,520 --> 01:06:02,720
Oh, Henry. I call him Mr. Nervous.

768
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:06,400
Always seems like he's about to
have a problem. Carrots?

769
01:06:06,600 --> 01:06:08,320
I got to the bottom of it,
Jean-Claude.

770
01:06:08,680 --> 01:06:09,760
I know everything.

771
01:06:10,480 --> 01:06:12,640
I hope you're not involved in this shit.

772
01:06:13,960 --> 01:06:16,680
- What shit?
- This is not the time or place, Bryan.

773
01:06:16,840 --> 01:06:18,840
- Are you involved?
- Involved in what?

774
01:06:19,480 --> 01:06:20,920
What are you two talking about?

775
01:06:21,080 --> 01:06:24,520
- Are you?
- My salary is X, my expenses are Y.

776
01:06:24,680 --> 01:06:26,680
As long as my family is provided for...

777
01:06:26,840 --> 01:06:29,320
...I do not care
where the difference comes from.

778
01:06:29,480 --> 01:06:31,320
That is my entire involvement.

779
01:06:31,480 --> 01:06:33,400
- What about my family?
- I told you...

780
01:06:33,560 --> 01:06:35,880
...I would help
as long as it didn't cause trouble.

781
01:06:36,040 --> 01:06:37,320
Who is Patrice Saint-Clair?

782
01:06:37,480 --> 01:06:40,840
I don't know, I don't care.
I am driving you to the airport.

783
01:06:41,080 --> 01:06:42,240
Jean-Claude.

784
01:06:43,680 --> 01:06:45,280
Let's get going. Dinner is over.

785
01:06:45,440 --> 01:06:47,160
- I'm not finished yet.
- Yes, you are.

786
01:06:47,400 --> 01:06:50,120
- No!
- No, I'm not.

787
01:06:54,680 --> 01:06:57,760
That's what happens when you sit
behind a desk. You forget things.

788
01:06:57,960 --> 01:07:00,320
Like the weight in the hand
of a gun that's loaded.

789
01:07:02,320 --> 01:07:03,400
Isabelle!

790
01:07:04,800 --> 01:07:05,920
It's a flesh wound.

791
01:07:06,080 --> 01:07:09,600
But if you don't get me what I need,
the last thing you'll see...

792
01:07:09,800 --> 01:07:11,680
...is the bullet
I put between her eyes.

793
01:07:11,880 --> 01:07:14,800
Now, Patrice Saint-Clair.

794
01:07:25,960 --> 01:07:27,680
You could've made this
less painful...

795
01:07:27,840 --> 01:07:31,800
...if you had been more concerned about
my daughter and less about your desk.

796
01:07:31,960 --> 01:07:34,200
Please apologize to your wife for me.

797
01:08:36,800 --> 01:08:39,520
- Can I help you?
- Yes, I'm here to see Mr. Saint-Clair.

798
01:08:39,720 --> 01:08:41,200
Your name, please.

799
01:08:45,040 --> 01:08:46,880
I'm sorry,
your name is not on the list.

800
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:48,520
Oh, please check again.

801
01:08:51,480 --> 01:08:53,120
Inside.

802
01:09:38,800 --> 01:09:40,000
May I help you, sir?

803
01:09:45,400 --> 01:09:47,800
- Your champagne.
- Yeah, I will take it.

804
01:09:57,160 --> 01:10:00,320
<i>I have 50,000. Fifty thousand.</i>

805
01:10:02,040 --> 01:10:03,960
<i>Fifty thousand.</i>

806
01:10:05,480 --> 01:10:08,600
<i>One hundred, 100,000.</i>

807
01:10:10,360 --> 01:10:13,400
<i>One hundred, 150.</i>

808
01:10:14,440 --> 01:10:15,560
<i>I have 150.</i>

809
01:10:16,200 --> 01:10:18,240
Your champagne, sir.

810
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,600
<i>Two, I have two, 250.</i>

811
01:10:21,760 --> 01:10:22,720
May I serve?

812
01:10:22,920 --> 01:10:24,200
<i>- Please.
- I have 250.</i>

813
01:10:25,960 --> 01:10:27,640
<i>Two-fifty.</i>

814
01:10:28,200 --> 01:10:31,120
<i>Sold for 250,000.</i>

815
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:43,000
You want me to bid?
There is one left.

816
01:10:43,400 --> 01:10:45,000
We'll see in a moment.

817
01:10:48,440 --> 01:10:50,520
<i>The last item.</i>

818
01:10:50,840 --> 01:10:53,240
<i>As usual, we save the best for last.</i>

819
01:10:53,560 --> 01:10:55,640
<i>Speaks English, some French.</i>

820
01:10:55,800 --> 01:10:57,160
<i>Certified pure.</i>

821
01:11:06,720 --> 01:11:07,680
- Sorry.
- Get out.

822
01:11:09,240 --> 01:11:11,840
<i>The bidding will begin at 100,000.</i>

823
01:11:15,200 --> 01:11:17,240
<i>One hundred.</i>

824
01:11:26,760 --> 01:11:28,480
<i>One hundred thousand.</i>

825
01:11:28,680 --> 01:11:30,720
- I said...
- I heard what you said.

826
01:11:30,920 --> 01:11:32,160
Buy her.

827
01:11:32,360 --> 01:11:33,400
<i>I have 100.</i>

828
01:11:35,080 --> 01:11:37,760
<i>- Buy her.
- One-fifty.</i>

829
01:11:37,920 --> 01:11:39,400
<i>Two hundred.</i>

830
01:11:40,120 --> 01:11:42,680
<i>Two-fifty, three, 350.</i>

831
01:11:42,880 --> 01:11:46,000
<i>Three hundred and fifty thousand.</i>

832
01:11:46,560 --> 01:11:48,680
<i>Four. Four.</i>

833
01:11:49,160 --> 01:11:51,520
<i>Four-fifty, 450.</i>

834
01:11:51,760 --> 01:11:53,560
<i>Four hundred and fifty thousand.</i>

835
01:11:54,240 --> 01:11:55,240
<i>Four-fifty.</i>

836
01:11:56,360 --> 01:11:58,280
<i>Five hundred. Five hundred thousand.</i>

837
01:11:58,440 --> 01:12:02,240
<i>Five hundred thousand. Sold.</i>

838
01:12:02,720 --> 01:12:06,240
<i>That concludes the sales for tonight.
Thank you all for coming.</i>

839
01:12:06,720 --> 01:12:09,560
<i>- You can collect your purchases directly.
- Move.</i>

840
01:12:09,720 --> 01:12:13,560
- You will never get away with this.
- Lf you wanna live, you'll make sure I do.

841
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,360
Now, Mr...?

842
01:12:31,320 --> 01:12:34,600
Well, we know you're not this man.
So, what do we call you?

843
01:12:37,800 --> 01:12:39,640
It doesn't matter what we call you...

844
01:12:39,800 --> 01:12:42,160
...what does matter
is what you're doing here.

845
01:12:43,480 --> 01:12:45,320
The last girl, I'm her father.

846
01:12:47,800 --> 01:12:50,800
- Oh, my.
- Give her to me.

847
01:12:52,040 --> 01:12:54,240
I wish I could, honestly.

848
01:12:54,400 --> 01:12:56,000
See, I'm a father myself.

849
01:12:56,200 --> 01:12:58,120
I have two sons and a daughter...

850
01:12:58,280 --> 01:13:01,160
...but let me tell you something,
Mr. Whoever-You-Are.

851
01:13:01,360 --> 01:13:02,600
This is a business.

852
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:04,480
This is a very unique business...

853
01:13:04,640 --> 01:13:07,240
...with a very unique clientele.
- I'll pay.

854
01:13:07,480 --> 01:13:09,800
In this business,
you have no refunds, returns...

855
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:11,960
...discounts, buybacks.
All sales are final.

856
01:13:12,160 --> 01:13:16,800
Besides discretion,
it's about the only rule we have.

857
01:13:18,680 --> 01:13:21,080
Kill him. Quietly. I have guests.

858
01:14:16,920 --> 01:14:19,200
Would you please go see
which part of "quietly"...

859
01:14:19,360 --> 01:14:21,920
...they did not understand?
- Yes, sir.

860
01:14:40,360 --> 01:14:43,960
Okay, we can resolve this.
I know how you feel.

861
01:14:44,120 --> 01:14:46,680
We should talk, okay?
We can work this out.

862
01:14:48,880 --> 01:14:50,520
You have no idea...

863
01:14:51,560 --> 01:14:52,760
- Where is she?
- Please.

864
01:14:52,960 --> 01:14:54,160
Understand. Please try...

865
01:14:58,680 --> 01:15:01,600
There's a boat by the quay.

866
01:15:02,800 --> 01:15:04,200
Please understand.

867
01:15:04,360 --> 01:15:08,560
It was all business,
it wasn't personal.

868
01:15:08,760 --> 01:15:10,400
It was all personal to me.

869
01:17:50,480 --> 01:17:52,360
It's ready

870
01:18:50,280 --> 01:18:52,080
You - take the girls

871
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:54,400
You - follow me

872
01:18:55,140 --> 01:18:56,400
Invaders!  Search the boat.

873
01:19:33,860 --> 01:19:36,080
Where are you?

874
01:19:37,440 --> 01:19:38,460
Why are you not answering?

875
01:20:03,920 --> 01:20:05,080
Get inside!

876
01:20:05,960 --> 01:20:06,960
What's the problem?

877
01:20:07,140 --> 01:20:09,200
The girls father has arrived.

878
01:20:09,440 --> 01:20:10,260
Leave it to me.

879
01:21:50,400 --> 01:21:51,400
We can...

880
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:06,440
- Daddy.
- Kim.

881
01:22:07,200 --> 01:22:09,240
You came for me.

882
01:22:13,600 --> 01:22:15,040
You came for me.

883
01:22:17,680 --> 01:22:19,640
I told you I would.

884
01:22:47,440 --> 01:22:50,440
<i>May I have your attention.
If you're waiting for oversized bags...</i>

885
01:22:51,880 --> 01:22:53,720
Mom.

886
01:22:55,360 --> 01:22:57,280
Oh, my God.

887
01:22:57,640 --> 01:22:59,840
Oh, sweetie.

888
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:02,720
Oh, here, let me get that for you.

889
01:23:02,880 --> 01:23:04,720
Bryan, if there's anything you need...

890
01:23:06,040 --> 01:23:08,120
I've got everything I need.

891
01:23:08,280 --> 01:23:10,760
I love you so much.

892
01:23:12,840 --> 01:23:14,840
Stuart.

893
01:23:15,720 --> 01:23:17,600
Thank you.

894
01:23:24,600 --> 01:23:27,400
<i>Attention, travelers.
You are not required to...</i>

895
01:23:27,560 --> 01:23:29,440
Shall we go?

896
01:23:34,240 --> 01:23:36,640
Sure you don't wanna ride with us?

897
01:23:37,240 --> 01:23:41,680
- I'll be fine. I'll take a cab. Thanks.
- All right.

898
01:23:49,640 --> 01:23:51,760
- I love you, Dad.
- Love you too.

899
01:24:13,920 --> 01:24:16,800
- Where are we?
- I told you. It's a surprise.

900
01:24:18,680 --> 01:24:20,560
- Hi.
- Hi.

901
01:24:23,360 --> 01:24:26,680
When someone says "Hi,"
it's usually polite to say "Hi" back.

902
01:24:27,400 --> 01:24:28,440
Hi.

903
01:24:28,640 --> 01:24:30,040
I heard you wanna be a singer.

904
01:24:30,200 --> 01:24:31,880
- I do.
- She does.

905
01:24:33,440 --> 01:24:36,640
Well, come on in.
Let's see what you got.

1
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,210
I'm going to bed.

2
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:54,710
- You drink one glass of wine and you fall asleep.
- It was two.

3
00:00:57,670 --> 00:01:00,250
You'll get your masters,
Miss. 3-day student.

4
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:21,170
- Do you think it's an accident?
- Who would want to kill princess Dy?

5
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:23,750
She's so young and so beautifull!

6
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:28,500
I'm going to sleep.

7
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:47,920
Jony, don't forget to feed kitty.

8
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:54,830
Kitty, kitty, dinner time!

9
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:27,250
Turn the music down!

10
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:42,500
Kitty, kitty, dinner's ready.

11
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:45,830
Kitty!

12
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,950
Kitty, kitty, dinner is ready.

13
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:08,990
Kitty, dinner's ready.

14
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:19,980
Why didn't you feed the cat, already?

15
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:08,020
Hey, shut that damn cat off.

16
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,810
What is your name?

17
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:27,440
Chainy. Kates.

18
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:31,940
And the deceased was your sister?

19
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:34,230
Her name is Jony.

20
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,640
We are twins.

21
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:41,810
Were you able to see
who did this?

22
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:44,190
Just a glimps.

23
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,640
It was dark.

24
00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:51,980
I'm not certain.

25
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:05,390
It is my opinion as a forensic psychiatrist

26
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:07,850
that John Forster is a serial psychopath.

27
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:11,100
If allowed to remain a free man in our society,

28
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:14,180
he will rape ang murder again.

29
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:19,020
Will the defendant, please, rise.

30
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:24,810
We, the jury, on this day, November 9th 1998,

31
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:28,770
find the defendant John Forster guilty

32
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:31,100
of murder in the first degree.

33
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:52,220
Oh, I've seen that outfit before.

34
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:54,590
I can't remember when.

35
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:57,380
Last night. Last night!

36
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,260
These things do return.

37
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:04,260
God, my head is still
pounding like a drum.

38
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:05,920
You party hard.

39
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:09,300
Yeah, well, you don't
look worse than I am.

40
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:11,550
I didn't drink as much as you.

41
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:13,300
History of my life, Sara.

42
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,010
Psychiatrist by day,
party animal by night.

43
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:19,760
I thought you've told
me you were a lawyer.

44
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:21,510
I'm not, yet.

45
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:25,760
Excuse me.

46
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:29,510
Yeah. Hey, Jack. It's Shelly.

47
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:32,970
I've been calling all morning.
You OK? I'm Ok. What's up?

48
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:34,130
I was worried.

49
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:36,670
You worry too much,
Shelly. What's going on?

50
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:39,510
Frank Parks is been calling. He
needs to speak with you immediately.

51
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:41,050
Pass him through.

52
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:46,510
I had fun last night, Miss. Pollard.

53
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,010
Me too.

54
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:50,800
Thanks for the wine tasting, Dr. Gramm.

55
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:52,420
Jack.

56
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:56,750
Hey, Jack, I've got
Frank Parks. Go ahead.

57
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,840
Hey, Frank. Jack.

58
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:01,420
We got another one.

59
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:03,500
Oh, no. The same?

60
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:04,880
Every detail.

61
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:07,630
Right down to the lateral laceration.

62
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:12,960
It's the Seattle slayer again.

63
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:15,210
Where are you now? Look, Jack.

64
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,170
There's a tape.

65
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:19,460
You're gonna wanna see it.

66
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,960
Jack, are you still there?

67
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:25,880
Yeah.

68
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,840
Meet me at my office, okay?

69
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,460
Sure, Jack.

70
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,000
Where to?

71
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:00,630
114 Western, please. Quickly.

72
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,540
Welcome back, Seattle.

73
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:12,620
We're continuing our
interview with John Forster...

74
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:16,290
Who was convicted for the death
of Janie Kay, nine years ago...

75
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:20,620
Based on the eyewitness testimony
of her twin sister, Janie Kay.

76
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:24,080
John Forster was dated to die at
midnight, at Walla Walla Penitentiary.

77
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,870
Do you mind changing it? John Forster.

78
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:28,040
What's your reaction to the State...

79
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:31,460
Thank you.

80
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,500
Congratulations!

81
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,450
For what?

82
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:01,950
I was referring to the hottie that
you left with the party last night.

83
00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:03,410
She was a quite piece of ass.

84
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:06,160
Remember her name? Yes, I do.

85
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:07,700
Sara Pollard.

86
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:11,410
Is that a cut on your nose? You
didn't have that before I left.

87
00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:13,910
I fell out of the bed. FBI hit here yet?

88
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:16,990
Yeah, 2 minutes in the
conference room. Okay.

89
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,830
Any calls?

90
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:21,200
New York Times,
Washington times, Newsweek.

91
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,620
They all wanna know if you have
a quote about Forster's execution.

92
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:27,490
What else is new? Kim
Cummings called twice.

93
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:30,410
She was worried about you
too. Kim knows this procedure.

94
00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:32,910
Apparently not. She's in your office.

95
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:35,490
Jack Gramm Associates.

96
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:38,700
I put those case reports you
wanna me to look at on your desk.

97
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:42,530
I thought Lauren and Leeza
showed real insight and ability.

98
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:44,740
The others were pretty
much working the math.

99
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:45,780
Yeah.

100
00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:52,450
Don't you have Federal
Agents waiting for you?

101
00:12:54,530 --> 00:12:55,370
Yeah.

102
00:12:55,370 --> 00:12:57,320
I' see you in class.

103
00:12:57,490 --> 00:13:00,410
I'll take them trough
today's work if you run late.

104
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:01,660
Thanks.

105
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:03,740
Thank you, Kim. Bye.

106
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:10,030
Janie Keith came by
to give you a present.

107
00:13:10,410 --> 00:13:11,740
Dr. Gramm.

108
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:14,110
I'm sorry. I don't know
if this is appropriate...

109
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:15,490
I just wanted to...

110
00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:18,410
I just wanted to mark the day.

111
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:19,910
Thank you, Janie.

112
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:24,070
I'm glad that my sister Janie
hasn't been forgotten. Thank you.

113
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:27,410
For everything. You
went out of your way.

114
00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:31,360
You are busy, so I'm just...
I'm gonna get out of here.

115
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:35,110
We did good, Janie. We did good.

116
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,450
All right.

117
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:37,860
Thanks.

118
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,570
Can I help you?

119
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:45,610
You are one of my students?

120
00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:46,900
Hi.

121
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:48,900
Jack. Yeah.

122
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:52,990
I'd like to introduce you to Jeremy
Goober, with attorney general office.

123
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:56,150
Jeremy is in charge of the
Seattle slayer task force.

124
00:13:56,150 --> 00:14:00,110
Dr. Gramm, it's so good to meet you.
This is a really big honor for me.

125
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:01,490
Sorry about the...

126
00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:03,740
Oh, this is such a beautiful
conference room too.

127
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:06,400
And this special agent
MacTire from the FBI.

128
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:07,570
Dr. Gramm.

129
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:09,740
Pleasure. Have a seat.

130
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:13,190
Hey, big fellow?

131
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,440
Yes.

132
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:17,280
Jeremy.

133
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:22,150
Seattle slayer task force.

134
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:26,480
Well, okay. I'm sure you
have a lot of questions.

135
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:31,150
I'll do the best I can to
answer them, but first I...

136
00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:36,400
No. First I think we
should all have a cookie.

137
00:14:36,570 --> 00:14:41,610
These are from Janie Kay, whose sister,
Janie was murdered by John Forster.

138
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:44,480
Jeremy? Sure, thank you.

139
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:49,030
Frank? No, thanks, Jack.

140
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,520
No?

141
00:14:51,070 --> 00:14:52,480
Mr. MacTire?

142
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,270
You are a good sport, Jeremy.

143
00:14:56,610 --> 00:14:59,070
A little milk maybe, what do you think?

144
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:06,650
Shelley, we got milk, don't
we? Bring in three glasses.

145
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:08,520
Nothing for me, Jack.

146
00:15:09,190 --> 00:15:10,570
All right, make that two.

147
00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:12,020
No, make it three.

148
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:14,940
Maybe you have a change of heart.

149
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:17,770
So, let's see...

150
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:20,690
I can assume...

151
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:23,980
That last night crime scene...

152
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:27,310
Was very much like Forster's
previous crime scene, right?

153
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:30,150
They totally match, yeah.
What totally matches?

154
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:33,400
I have in here...

155
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:42,190
Halothane on the breath.
Subdued by Halothane.

156
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:43,900
Rape. Yeah.

157
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:46,230
The body was hung up side down.

158
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:47,230
Yes.

159
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:48,480
And...

160
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,900
Slashed throat.

161
00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:57,560
And where this takes us?
Looks like a copy cat.

162
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,690
It could be. Maybe Could be? Maybe?

163
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:03,980
Maybe. It's a stage scene. Maybe what?

164
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:06,600
Maybe, and this might be far-Fetched...

165
00:16:06,810 --> 00:16:09,770
But what if the perp
worked with Forster...

166
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:14,180
And these stage scenes were intended to
throw some doubts on his guilty verdict?

167
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,770
Go with it. Possibly providing him...

168
00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:20,230
With a stay of execution
or even a new trial.

169
00:16:20,770 --> 00:16:24,020
Goal star, Jeremy. Big goal star.

170
00:16:24,270 --> 00:16:27,310
I mean, that's exactly what
I think is happening here.

171
00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:30,180
No, I'm sticking with copy cat.

172
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:32,890
Of course there is another possibility.

173
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:35,020
Yeah? Forster is innocent.

174
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:36,770
Wrongly convicted. No!

175
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:38,600
The task force is aware...

176
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,930
That your expert opinion was
critical in convicting Forster.

177
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:43,810
But then why he walked his first trial?

178
00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:45,140
Procedural error.

179
00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:48,470
Why is he never been tried in any of
the other five pending murderers...

180
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:50,430
That you've attributed to him?

181
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:54,810
You realize that it is the dude of my
office to ensure that an innocent man...

182
00:16:54,810 --> 00:16:57,810
Is not executed tonight.
You do understand that?

183
00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:02,310
Look, Jack. If you have any
reconsideration of testimony...

184
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:05,140
Or anything new you
wanna lay on the table...

185
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:06,640
Now it would be the time.

186
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,260
Would you say it was
fair to characterize...

187
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:09,720
Your attitude towards John Forster...

188
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:13,970
As a personal vendetta? Lf
we're been fair, yeah, sure.

189
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:17,800
It's a personal vendetta. I have a
personal vendetta against Ted Bundy...

190
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:21,390
And Gacy and about 10 or
15 other serial murders...

191
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,970
That are on the streets
right now. Jack, please.

192
00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:25,180
That's helpful.

193
00:17:25,930 --> 00:17:28,640
There is one other issue
that we need to address.

194
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,050
Milk maid.

195
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:48,180
What's going on here?

196
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:51,340
Do you know a woman named Dale Morris?

197
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:52,970
Yes.

198
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:54,720
How?

199
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:58,300
She's a student of mine.
She's just a student of yours?

200
00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:02,630
Dr. Gramm, we're federal agency
here. You don't wanna be lying here.

201
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:06,130
We had a relationship. You've
been very cryptic right now?

202
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:10,510
He had a professional relationship,
not a sexual relationship.

203
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:14,300
About a year ago her father
died. She was very troubled.

204
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:17,470
I treated her as psychiatrist.

205
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,430
I don't sleep with my
students, Mr. Goober.

206
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,920
Neither I sleep with my patients.

207
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:28,220
Now what does this have to
do with anything? Anyway.

208
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:30,010
Jack.

209
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:32,800
Dale Morris was murdered last night.

210
00:18:33,050 --> 00:18:35,220
She's the third and latest victim.

211
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:40,670
When was the last time you saw Dale?

212
00:18:42,010 --> 00:18:43,260
Well...

213
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,210
I saw...

214
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,260
I saw her last night.

215
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:56,210
To our impossibly difficult professor.

216
00:18:56,670 --> 00:18:58,840
We say thank you...

217
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:02,340
For making our lives miserable.

218
00:19:03,010 --> 00:19:04,760
The pleasure is all mine.

219
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:18,300
We're celebrating.

220
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:21,000
You're celebrating
Forster's pending execution?

221
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:27,250
No, we're celebrating his
conviction, not his execution.

222
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:31,750
It was an overturn so we're happy about that.
We worked hard on this case.

223
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:34,840
We have a tape that was
left on the crime scene.

224
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:38,590
We're gonna play it for you now.

225
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:43,460
This message is for Dr. Jack Gramm.

226
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:48,420
You got the wrong man.

227
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:50,080
Forster is innocent.

228
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:52,500
Please, don't hurt me anymore.

229
00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:54,960
Don't hurt me anymore.

230
00:19:56,170 --> 00:19:58,210
You gonna let me go, right?

231
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:03,540
You said you'd let me go. I've
read what you want me and...

232
00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:17,880
Jack, it goes like that for
about an hour, before she dies.

233
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:21,540
Why do you think she was reading
you that message, Dr. Gramm?

234
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,250
Dr. Gramm?

235
00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:31,080
Dr. Gramm?

236
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:33,040
In Dr. Gramm own words...

237
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:35,330
He analyzes a mental puzzle.

238
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:38,330
So they're no actual
tangible pieces per say.

239
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,080
He made a guess based
on what happened to Kate.

240
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:44,750
A guess based on his
intuition, a personal bias, ego.

241
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:48,540
And he sold that fiction lock,
stock and barrel to the jury.

242
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,750
What is it?

243
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:01,790
The girl that was killed last night...

244
00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:04,750
Was Dale Morris. Dale?

245
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,160
Oh, my God.

246
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:12,160
Okay, let's see...

247
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:15,620
We have our investigators
coordinated with the FBI...

248
00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:21,080
I wanna know everything Dale
Morris did on the last 24 hours.

249
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:23,620
I wanna know where she
went, who she talked to.

250
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:26,990
Can you please have Dr. Gramm's
car ready, please. Thank you.

251
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:30,290
Thank you, Shelley.

252
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:31,790
For what?

253
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:36,540
I don't know. For everything.
I hate when you do this, Jack.

254
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:39,540
Every time you o this, I
think you gonna end up dead.

255
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:43,910
Just don't ask me to marry you again.

256
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:45,830
Why not? We're perfect for each other.

257
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:49,780
Yeah, yeah. Except that I'm
gay and you're commitment phobe.

258
00:21:49,990 --> 00:21:52,030
That's why we're perfect.

259
00:21:53,990 --> 00:21:55,620
Thanks, baby.

260
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:01,530
Dr. Gramm is a world known
expert in forensic psychiatry.

261
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:04,450
What is forensic psychiatry?

262
00:22:05,370 --> 00:22:07,950
I mean, is not the same profession
that destroyed MacMorton's life...

263
00:22:07,950 --> 00:22:10,870
By conjuring up images
of child molestation?

264
00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:14,530
None of the charges were ever proved.
And the accused, though innocent...

265
00:22:14,530 --> 00:22:16,070
Was public crucified.

266
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:42,990
Jack, look. Look at the kite.

267
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:47,410
Jack, come here.

268
00:23:53,030 --> 00:23:54,230
Yeah?

269
00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:56,610
Hello?

270
00:23:59,190 --> 00:24:00,820
Hello?

271
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:03,270
You have 88 minutes to live.

272
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:04,270
What?

273
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,780
You know how long 88
minutes can be, don't you?

274
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:09,150
That's 11:45 am. Who is this?

275
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,270
Tic-Tac. Who the hell is this?

276
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:12,730
Tic-Tac.

277
00:24:13,770 --> 00:24:15,320
What were you saying?

278
00:24:30,770 --> 00:24:33,060
Jack Gramm Associates. Shelley?

279
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:35,650
I want you to set a trap
and and a trace on my cell.

280
00:24:35,650 --> 00:24:36,480
What's going on?

281
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:39,610
I want you to contact
a wireless carrier...

282
00:24:39,730 --> 00:24:42,360
And have them find out who
made that last phone call to me.

283
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:44,690
Jack, I could be more
helpful if... Just do it.

284
00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:45,900
Just do it. I need it, all right?

285
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:47,940
And call me when you get it.

286
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:53,850
John Forster was an Eagle Scout, which
counts for his facility with ropes.

287
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:56,520
He also worked in a veterinary office...

288
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:59,900
Where he had experience using the
animal tranquilizer Halothane...

289
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:01,560
Witch he's used to subdue his victims.

290
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:06,190
Halothane. Sorry, I'm
late again. Thank you, Kim.

291
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:10,980
I see that the size of our
class is dwindling once again.

292
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:13,560
It could be because you
keep booting everyone.

293
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:16,440
My favorite student, Mike Stempt.

294
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:23,940
Okay. The legal distinction between
sanity and insanity rests upon what?

295
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:27,310
Free will. The concept of the free will.

296
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:30,480
And what is the most important thing...

297
00:25:30,690 --> 00:25:33,230
One should remember when
entering a court-Room?

298
00:25:33,230 --> 00:25:37,270
That insanity it's a legal concept.
It's not a medical or psychiatric term.

299
00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:39,520
But despite the fact that
insanity is a legal concept...

300
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:41,180
It doesn't mean that
someone is not sick.

301
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:42,310
Yes, Lauren.

302
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:45,640
Of all the serial killers that
I've interviewed and studied...

303
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:49,730
Witch include our boy
Bundy, Dahmer, Gacy...

304
00:25:49,770 --> 00:25:52,140
None of them was legally insane.

305
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:54,480
This is not saying
that they were normal.

306
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,310
I could argue that they
couldn't help themselves...

307
00:25:56,310 --> 00:25:57,890
Precisely because of
their mental disorder.

308
00:25:57,890 --> 00:26:00,140
Well, if you wanna argue, Mike...

309
00:26:00,390 --> 00:26:02,220
School of law is across campus.

310
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:03,810
Come on, Dr. Gramm.

311
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:07,430
It's ingenuous to pretend that our
presentations are not arguments.

312
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:09,600
We create a narrative of
the crime and the criminal.

313
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:12,350
Narrative is based on
facts. Based on logic.

314
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:16,060
We don't walk into a court-Room
and advocate set scenes, do we?

315
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:20,140
We don't take sides. We
check our views at the door.

316
00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:22,810
You mean you want us to pretend
we don't have an opinion?

317
00:26:22,810 --> 00:26:25,640
We have opinions, Lauren, but
we just keep them to ourselves.

318
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:28,100
Share them with your
dog, if you have to.

319
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:30,600
Not with your parrot,
because it talks back.

320
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:34,470
It is that kind of logic that's gonna
get you in a law school across campus.

321
00:26:34,470 --> 00:26:35,930
I've been there. I've done that.

322
00:26:35,930 --> 00:26:37,890
Well, my condolences.

323
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:41,180
So, where is...

324
00:26:41,470 --> 00:26:44,510
Dale Morris? She's
absent. I don't see her.

325
00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:48,970
That's her first.

326
00:26:52,890 --> 00:26:54,930
I didn't take her for a quitter.

327
00:26:56,140 --> 00:27:00,300
Anyone who has her phone number,
please, contact me after class.

328
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:05,760
Okay.

329
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:08,050
Excuse me.

330
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:11,680
Shelley.

331
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:15,930
Tick-Tack, doc. You have 83
minutes to live, Dr. Gramm.

332
00:27:17,390 --> 00:27:19,010
Tick-Tack, doc.

333
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:32,260
So where was I?

334
00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:34,340
Bundy versus Forster.

335
00:27:34,550 --> 00:27:36,800
What? Bundy versus Forster.

336
00:27:37,930 --> 00:27:39,300
Thank you, Lauren.

337
00:27:42,510 --> 00:27:43,760
You're welcome.

338
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:50,840
What we're gonna explore today is the
similarities and dissimilarities...

339
00:27:51,090 --> 00:27:56,260
Say, from Ted Bundy's motives, let's
compared them to John Forster's.

340
00:28:02,130 --> 00:28:04,220
Dr. Gramm, your phone is ringing.

341
00:28:11,510 --> 00:28:14,050
Jack, are you there?
Shelley. What's going on?

342
00:28:14,050 --> 00:28:15,840
The call was made from a cell phone.

343
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:18,210
One of those you buy
and pay minutes for it.

344
00:28:18,210 --> 00:28:19,420
Registered to whom?

345
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:23,000
Look, I know you're in class,
but... Yes, who is registered to it?

346
00:28:24,670 --> 00:28:25,840
A Kate Gramm.

347
00:28:30,090 --> 00:28:33,000
Jack, it's a common name. It
doesn't have to be your sister.

348
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,670
It's just a coincidence.

349
00:28:36,130 --> 00:28:37,750
It's not a coincidence.

350
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:43,250
It's not a coincidence.
Jack, I'm loosing you.

351
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:45,170
Shelley? Goddamn it!

352
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:46,630
Shelley?

353
00:28:46,710 --> 00:28:49,800
Have you found out who my
phone is registered to by now?

354
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:53,290
Poor Kate. If it was Kate,
you'd like to call her?

355
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:56,170
I'm gonna find you, you here
that, you son-Of-A-Bitch?

356
00:28:56,170 --> 00:28:58,840
You're barking up the
wrong tree on this one.

357
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,250
I'm gonna find you.

358
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:02,540
She suffered for such a long time.

359
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:05,500
You remember how long, don't you?

360
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:07,960
You still feel guilty about her?

361
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:11,500
You feel guilty about
falsifying the evidence?

362
00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:13,790
For lying under oath?

363
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,500
Tic-Tac, doc. You have
79 minutes to live.

364
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:50,750
Do you find this funny, Albert?

365
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:53,080
Who were you calling on your phone?

366
00:29:54,290 --> 00:29:55,790
Let me see your phone.

367
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:57,460
I was just...

368
00:29:57,670 --> 00:29:59,080
Let me see that goddamn it phone.

369
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:00,580
I was just checking the Mariners score.

370
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:02,960
You were what? I was
checking the Mariners score.

371
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,620
Okay, what is the score?

372
00:30:06,210 --> 00:30:07,210
The score.

373
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:09,160
What's the damn score?

374
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:13,660
It's 3 x 1 Mariners. B1.

375
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:50,450
Oh, my God, I can't believe it. What
does it mean? What's the problem?

376
00:30:50,450 --> 00:30:51,740
Look.

377
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:52,740
What?

378
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:54,700
What's going on here?

379
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:57,620
It says that Dale Morris
was murdered last night.

380
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:00,910
Is that true, Dr. Gramm? Yeah.

381
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:04,200
You knew it? You knew it
and you didn't tell us?

382
00:31:04,410 --> 00:31:07,490
You knew and asked for Dale's
number? Is it the slayer?

383
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:09,580
It could be. It could be?

384
00:31:09,830 --> 00:31:12,160
Well, the police haven't
released any information yet.

385
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:14,830
Are we all in danger? I can't
believe you didn't tell us.

386
00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:17,330
Dr. Gramm? Lynn Johnson.

387
00:31:17,370 --> 00:31:19,280
Someone just called a bomb threat.

388
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:22,530
Everyone is to evacuate the
building immediately. Thank you.

389
00:31:22,530 --> 00:31:24,660
Come on. Grab your stuff.

390
00:31:24,830 --> 00:31:27,490
I'll get your papers
of presentation, Tom.

391
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:29,370
I got the slides, Kim.

392
00:31:33,030 --> 00:31:37,450
All students, faculty and staff
must evacuate the building.

393
00:31:37,530 --> 00:31:40,740
I repeat. Everyone must
evacuate the building.

394
00:31:49,610 --> 00:31:53,990
All students, faculty and staff
must evacuate the building.

395
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:57,410
I repeat. Everyone must
evacuate the building.

396
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:03,740
Please, remain calm e do not run.

397
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:06,740
Proceed to the door to
the end of the campus.

398
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:10,400
I repeat. We must evacuate the building.

399
00:32:11,570 --> 00:32:14,400
Jack? What are you doing? Get going.

400
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:20,990
All students, faculty and staff
must evacuate the building.

401
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:23,860
What was that on the screen?

402
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:28,320
Some student playing
a joke or something.

403
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:32,070
You of all people know that it breaks
school laws to proceed by a threat...

404
00:32:32,070 --> 00:32:35,360
You need to report this to the
campus security immediately.

405
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:39,240
Carol. I get threat like this,
three or four times a year.

406
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:42,440
Your incredible arrogance will
slap the shit of you, Jack.

407
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:44,900
I wish you'd disclosure your
true feelings about me...

408
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:46,530
Before we became such good friends.

409
00:32:46,530 --> 00:32:49,110
Maybe you should stop hiding behind
your assessments about other people...

410
00:32:49,110 --> 00:32:50,280
And start assessing yourself...

411
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:52,240
Cause you need to get over your
past and go on with your life...

412
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:54,360
Cause what you're living isn't one.

413
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:56,650
It is not what you tell your patients?

414
00:32:57,650 --> 00:32:59,610
Gum? Thank you.

415
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:02,360
I'll call campus security and
let them know you're on your way.

416
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:05,280
Where did you go last
night? When you left the bar.

417
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,400
Home.

418
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:10,530
Were you alone?

419
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:13,230
Screw you.

420
00:33:31,690 --> 00:33:33,270
Roger. We're on it.

421
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:44,770
Yeah.

422
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:47,860
The press got a hold of Dale's
name. It's all over the news.

423
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:49,360
Yeah, I know that.

424
00:33:50,690 --> 00:33:54,150
And Forster's attorney is going
to the court and try a stay.

425
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:56,650
A stay? On what grounds?

426
00:33:57,020 --> 00:33:58,400
They're claiming that these...

427
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:01,150
Murders prove that the real killer
have never been brought to justice.

428
00:34:01,150 --> 00:34:04,480
Nonsense. They're just trying
to buy time. They're desperate.

429
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:08,190
They're also claiming that you falsify
testimony and concealed evidences.

430
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:10,560
Well, it's all loose. Goddamn it.

431
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:13,400
Who is that guy?

432
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:19,900
What about Dale Morris?
Did we find anymore of her?

433
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:23,440
She was murdered in her apartment...

434
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,600
Between the hours of two and six am.

435
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:27,480
Any sign of force entry? No.

436
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:31,020
Does Forster still have that
group visiting him on prison?

437
00:34:31,730 --> 00:34:34,350
He's like a goddamn rock
star. Website and all.

438
00:34:34,350 --> 00:34:37,440
I want you to pull a background
check on all my students...

439
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,020
And get back to me.

440
00:34:40,810 --> 00:34:41,520
Damn.

441
00:34:45,310 --> 00:34:46,310
Oh, no.

442
00:35:29,430 --> 00:35:30,810
Okay.

443
00:36:28,930 --> 00:36:31,260
Kim? What are you doing here?

444
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:33,140
I'm getting my car, it's parked here...

445
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:35,590
Like it's every day
I come to the campus.

446
00:36:36,470 --> 00:36:40,630
That was really horrible. Just
horrible what you did in class...

447
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:43,130
It's was little low for you. I
was looking for potential suspects.

448
00:36:43,130 --> 00:36:46,470
That's what I was doing. What did you
do after you left the party last night?

449
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:49,510
I didn't end up drunk in
bed with an strange like you.

450
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:53,720
You left the party with Dale Morris,
the girl that was murdered, didn't you?

451
00:36:54,470 --> 00:36:57,470
Yes, I did. So what did
you do? Where did you go?

452
00:36:58,380 --> 00:37:00,920
You're not seriously considering...

453
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:03,470
Where did you go?

454
00:37:03,470 --> 00:37:06,590
We went to the Hickory Stick.
We had a drink, two drinks.

455
00:37:06,590 --> 00:37:09,010
And then? And then I went home alone.

456
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:13,340
You have anyone that can verify
that? No. No-One can verify it.

457
00:37:13,510 --> 00:37:15,050
Come on. I've been your
teaching assistant for two years.

458
00:37:15,050 --> 00:37:18,090
I'm your friend. I'm here
to help you, if you let me.

459
00:37:18,130 --> 00:37:19,590
Follow me.

460
00:37:22,670 --> 00:37:24,380
Follow me.

461
00:37:28,130 --> 00:37:29,630
Who did that?

462
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,460
What does that mean?

463
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:34,550
According to a anonymous phone call...

464
00:37:34,550 --> 00:37:37,550
That means I have 72
minutes left to live.

465
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,920
Can I borrow your cell phone?

466
00:37:40,130 --> 00:37:41,590
I've broke mine.

467
00:37:42,710 --> 00:37:43,920
These are my car keys.

468
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:46,380
Can you take that around front
and meet me there in ten minutes?

469
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:49,550
I have to go to the
campus security. Okay.

470
00:37:49,630 --> 00:37:51,960
Call me on my Blackberry
if you run late.

471
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:52,880
Okay.

472
00:37:54,670 --> 00:37:58,090
Shelley. You gonna have to
reach me on Kim's cell phone.

473
00:37:58,300 --> 00:37:59,210
What happened to yours?

474
00:37:59,210 --> 00:38:01,050
I broke it. What?

475
00:38:01,170 --> 00:38:02,800
You have her number, don't you?

476
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:03,670
Yeah, I do.

477
00:38:03,670 --> 00:38:08,550
Listen, just forward all the
calls, okay, to Kim's cell.

478
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:10,800
Please, thanks.

479
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:12,550
Dr. Gramm.

480
00:38:13,090 --> 00:38:14,040
Hey, Mike.

481
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:18,550
Everyone is pretty upset about Dale.

482
00:38:18,750 --> 00:38:22,590
Yeah, well, that's understandable.
Considering the circumstances.

483
00:38:23,090 --> 00:38:25,210
I have a question about John Forster.

484
00:38:25,210 --> 00:38:26,920
Yeah? What?

485
00:38:27,710 --> 00:38:31,540
Well, I've been going through the
trial transcripts in Kate's history...

486
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:33,130
Why would you do that?

487
00:38:33,130 --> 00:38:36,880
To understand your process better.
How you come to your conclusions.

488
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:38,920
And?

489
00:38:39,670 --> 00:38:40,920
What?

490
00:38:42,210 --> 00:38:44,830
Is it possible that Forster is innocent?

491
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:45,830
No.

492
00:38:46,250 --> 00:38:48,330
You won't even consider the possibility?

493
00:38:48,330 --> 00:38:49,290
No.

494
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:53,420
You're completely convinced the scenario
you put together is the only one?

495
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:56,170
First of all, I didn't
put together a scenario.

496
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:58,790
I recreated the crime scene. Second...

497
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,250
I didn't convict Forster. A jury did.

498
00:39:01,250 --> 00:39:02,960
But the evidence was circumstantial.

499
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:04,710
No DNA, no murder weapon.

500
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:08,540
Nothing directly linking Forster to
the crime, except your narrative...

501
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:11,160
And Janie Kay's testimony.
What's your point?

502
00:39:11,750 --> 00:39:14,000
Just that your testimony
was very convincing.

503
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,580
That's my job.

504
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:17,370
To be convincing.

505
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:21,670
I thought it was to be right.

506
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:35,960
Help!

507
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:39,620
Somebody, please!

508
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:44,830
Help!

509
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:46,330
Help!

510
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:51,830
Lauren. Dr. Gramm.

511
00:39:51,830 --> 00:39:52,790
What happened to you?

512
00:39:52,790 --> 00:39:54,790
He's wearing a leather
jacket. He's out there.

513
00:39:54,790 --> 00:39:57,910
I bit his hand, it's bleeding. If
his hand is bloody, you can get him.

514
00:39:57,910 --> 00:40:01,160
You're okay? Go get him now! I'm fine!

515
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:35,450
Watch my car! It's a police action!

516
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:36,660
There's been an assault.

517
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:38,490
I wanna see your hands. Back off!

518
00:40:38,490 --> 00:40:40,240
Roll the window down. No!

519
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:43,490
I'm a forensic psychiatric
with the FBI. Here.

520
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:45,490
Okay? Open the window now.

521
00:40:45,580 --> 00:40:47,990
Yeah. See? Well, roll down the window...

522
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:50,990
And let me see your hands.
Let me see your hands.

523
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:53,490
If you have nothing to
hide, you can show me.

524
00:40:53,490 --> 00:40:55,570
Look, I'm trying to go home. What?

525
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:58,370
Okay, sorry.

526
00:41:04,950 --> 00:41:06,030
Excuse me.

527
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:08,950
There's been an assault.
I wanna see your hand.

528
00:41:15,910 --> 00:41:17,740
Okay. Be cool now!

529
00:41:19,110 --> 00:41:21,320
There's been an assault.
I gotta check your hands.

530
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:24,200
I'm a forensic psychiatric with the FBI.

531
00:41:40,570 --> 00:41:41,990
Sorry.

532
00:41:51,150 --> 00:41:52,650
I couldn't find him.

533
00:41:52,940 --> 00:41:54,110
Here.

534
00:41:55,190 --> 00:41:56,990
This is stupid.

535
00:41:57,740 --> 00:41:58,900
I'm so stupid.

536
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:02,190
How I could be so weak? Such a
wimp. It's not your fault. Come on.

537
00:42:02,190 --> 00:42:05,280
I can't believe I let him get away
like that. I should've fought back more.

538
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:07,650
Stop beating yourself
up? What exactly happened?

539
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:11,070
He came from behind. He put this
rag over my mouth and I bit his hand.

540
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:13,860
The rag had an odor? Something sweet...

541
00:42:14,990 --> 00:42:16,570
It's Halothane, right?

542
00:42:16,860 --> 00:42:18,650
Yeah. He's the one.

543
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:20,280
Probably.

544
00:42:20,570 --> 00:42:22,190
I let Dale's murderer get away.

545
00:42:22,190 --> 00:42:24,650
Stop beating yourself
up and tell me something.

546
00:42:24,650 --> 00:42:27,820
Tell me something. Could you
identify him if you saw him again?

547
00:42:27,820 --> 00:42:30,280
He came from behind, I didn't see him.

548
00:42:33,110 --> 00:42:36,520
Let's go to the campus security,
you'll tell the everything.

549
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:45,150
Hello.

550
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:47,610
This woman has just been attacked.

551
00:42:47,690 --> 00:42:49,150
Are you okay?

552
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:50,520
I think so.

553
00:42:50,730 --> 00:42:52,070
What's your name?

554
00:42:53,270 --> 00:42:54,770
Lauren Douglas.

555
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:56,570
And who are you?

556
00:42:56,650 --> 00:42:58,020
Jack Gramm.

557
00:42:58,570 --> 00:43:00,650
The famous Dr. Jack Gramm?

558
00:43:00,860 --> 00:43:02,730
Then Johnson Fonsen
have you be coming in.

559
00:43:02,730 --> 00:43:05,810
Is there someone to interview
Miss Douglas now, please?

560
00:43:06,610 --> 00:43:07,690
Jimmy? Yeah.

561
00:43:07,770 --> 00:43:10,400
You wanna check out
this girl? Wait a minute.

562
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:11,610
Right this way.

563
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:19,020
What's going on here?

564
00:43:19,350 --> 00:43:21,730
The person who attacked her
may still be on the campus.

565
00:43:21,730 --> 00:43:22,770
What the hell you guys doing?

566
00:43:22,770 --> 00:43:25,270
We got all these guys
out on the bomb squad.

567
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:28,150
Excuse me for one moment. It's
a little crazy around here.

568
00:43:28,150 --> 00:43:31,020
Jimmy, get off the phone and
interview Miss. Douglas, please.

569
00:43:31,020 --> 00:43:32,440
I'll be right there.

570
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:36,980
Why won't you seat here?

571
00:43:40,060 --> 00:43:41,940
Okay, you okay?

572
00:43:44,850 --> 00:43:47,060
Jack Gramm Associates.
Shelley? Get Frank...

573
00:43:47,060 --> 00:43:48,850
And pass him through
when you get him. Okay.

574
00:43:48,850 --> 00:43:50,150
Okay, thank you.

575
00:43:50,850 --> 00:43:54,940
I don't want you going back to your
apartment until the locks are changed.

576
00:43:55,060 --> 00:43:57,190
I don't have anywhere else to go.

577
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:00,890
After you talk to the officer here...

578
00:44:01,350 --> 00:44:04,560
Go back to my office. Shelley
will find a place to stay.

579
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:05,440
Okay.

580
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:09,390
Come on. It's gonna be all right.
Sorry for all the troubles I caused.

581
00:44:12,930 --> 00:44:14,850
Miss. Douglas. Right this way.

582
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:17,890
Right in here. I'm sorry.

583
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:22,520
Yeah? I left a word for Frank.

584
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:25,100
Okay. There's been another incident.

585
00:44:25,310 --> 00:44:27,850
The Forster's case
it's your thing, right?

586
00:44:27,890 --> 00:44:29,560
Wrong, it's not my thing.

587
00:44:29,730 --> 00:44:32,350
I saw your testimony on Court TV.

588
00:44:32,390 --> 00:44:33,470
Yeah, right?

589
00:44:34,060 --> 00:44:35,270
Fill those out.

590
00:44:36,850 --> 00:44:39,680
Yeah, I follow the big crime cases.

591
00:44:39,890 --> 00:44:41,270
They fascinate me.

592
00:44:41,430 --> 00:44:44,100
When Dr. Jack Gramm takes the stand.

593
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:47,720
You come up with things
I didn't think off.

594
00:44:50,270 --> 00:44:54,220
This here, this is just a job until...
Until you pass the police's exam.

595
00:44:54,430 --> 00:44:56,350
See? How did you know that?

596
00:44:56,680 --> 00:44:57,850
Just a guess.

597
00:44:58,060 --> 00:44:59,600
That's the thing about you.

598
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:02,220
You know how to put two plus
two and you make it four.

599
00:45:02,220 --> 00:45:03,140
Or five.

600
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:05,680
There are times that you know.

601
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:09,010
I'm not gonna be a campus cop
to a bunch of snob rich kids.

602
00:45:09,220 --> 00:45:10,430
Especially these rich bitches...

603
00:45:10,430 --> 00:45:14,510
My car is been analyzed.
The window was smashed.

604
00:45:14,850 --> 00:45:17,720
There's a number on
the body. Look into it.

605
00:45:18,350 --> 00:45:19,640
Dr. Gramm?

606
00:45:22,970 --> 00:45:24,430
Dr. Gramm?

607
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:31,350
This is Johnny D'Franco,
from campus security.

608
00:45:31,350 --> 00:45:33,470
Can you get me Lynn Johnson?

609
00:45:34,100 --> 00:45:36,140
Jack Gramm Associates. Shelley?

610
00:45:36,220 --> 00:45:39,300
Did you find Frank? No, not
yet. What the hell is going on?

611
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:44,260
Well, I received a threaten phone
call saying I have 88 minutes to live.

612
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:47,390
11:45h this morning, and my time is up.

613
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:49,760
Pull out my risk assessment file.

614
00:45:50,010 --> 00:45:52,180
Anybody rating "e" and above...

615
00:45:52,340 --> 00:45:55,010
I want you to cross
reference against Forster.

616
00:45:55,470 --> 00:45:57,220
And when you find Frank...

617
00:45:57,260 --> 00:46:01,630
Ask him if Sara Pollard or any of my
students ever visit Forster in prison.

618
00:46:02,050 --> 00:46:03,840
Sara Pollard?

619
00:46:04,010 --> 00:46:06,760
She's the girl I met
at the party last night.

620
00:46:08,180 --> 00:46:09,470
Call Wong Lee...

621
00:46:09,590 --> 00:46:12,220
And have him make a list
of all the phone numbers...

622
00:46:12,220 --> 00:46:14,300
Forster called on the last 72 hours.

623
00:46:14,300 --> 00:46:16,050
Where should fax the list?

624
00:46:16,590 --> 00:46:17,760
My apartment.

625
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:19,880
And run a check on Kim.

626
00:46:21,630 --> 00:46:22,380
Kim?

627
00:46:23,510 --> 00:46:26,050
Yeah, just do it, okay? Hello.

628
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:27,470
Jack.

629
00:46:28,300 --> 00:46:30,340
Damn it. The car is out front.

630
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:32,220
Drive Squaid. Good.

631
00:46:32,380 --> 00:46:33,880
You're okay? You look
a little freaked out.

632
00:46:33,880 --> 00:46:35,050
Yeah. You have...

633
00:46:35,050 --> 00:46:37,340
A battery for your phone? Yeah, I do.

634
00:46:41,050 --> 00:46:43,050
What the hell is this?
What are you doing?

635
00:46:43,050 --> 00:46:45,210
Goddamn it, what is this?

636
00:46:45,510 --> 00:46:46,800
What are you doing with
a gun in your purse?

637
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:48,630
Jesus, why don't you just
announce to the world?

638
00:46:48,630 --> 00:46:50,920
I don't think they've heard
you in English Department.

639
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:52,880
Why the gun, Kim? For protection.

640
00:46:53,260 --> 00:46:56,380
Where did you get it? I have
a permit. My dad is a cop.

641
00:46:56,420 --> 00:46:59,260
Why you need a gun? I
don't. My dad thinks I do.

642
00:46:59,460 --> 00:47:00,670
Why?

643
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:03,130
I have a crazy ex boyfriend, okay, Jack?

644
00:47:03,130 --> 00:47:04,380
Oh. Jesus. God.

645
00:47:04,590 --> 00:47:07,340
Yeah, I really know
how to pick one or what?

646
00:47:07,340 --> 00:47:09,710
The judge said if he threats
anyone he goes back to jail.

647
00:47:09,710 --> 00:47:12,050
Back to jail? What jail?

648
00:47:12,340 --> 00:47:15,050
Prison, actually. Walla Walla.

649
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:19,500
That's where Forster is.

650
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:23,250
Come on, let's go.

651
00:47:23,550 --> 00:47:25,420
Special Agent Parks.

652
00:47:25,590 --> 00:47:26,790
Frank, it's Jack.

653
00:47:26,790 --> 00:47:30,250
I'm at the university
campus. We got a problem here.

654
00:47:30,380 --> 00:47:34,090
Someone attacked one of my students and
tried to knock her out with Halothane.

655
00:47:34,090 --> 00:47:37,500
That's the Seattle
slayer. I know, hold on.

656
00:47:37,750 --> 00:47:39,130
Give me a second.

657
00:47:40,210 --> 00:47:44,670
Yeah. There's a security guard on
this campus, his name is D'Franco.

658
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:46,960
I don't like him. He's suspicious.

659
00:47:47,130 --> 00:47:49,250
I want you to take him
in for questioning, okay?

660
00:47:49,250 --> 00:47:51,960
Also get a warrant and search his place.

661
00:47:52,040 --> 00:47:53,210
Jesus Christ, Jack.

662
00:47:53,210 --> 00:47:56,170
You know I can't just get a
warrant without sufficient grounds.

663
00:47:56,170 --> 00:47:58,250
Just get a warrant, Frank, come on.

664
00:47:58,250 --> 00:48:00,130
Do you think he is the slayer?

665
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:03,380
To link Forster on the
outside? It's possible.

666
00:48:03,710 --> 00:48:07,420
Listen, I checked the names
that Shelley, of the students.

667
00:48:07,710 --> 00:48:11,580
And there's no record of Lauren
Douglas, Kim Cummings or Sara Pollard...

668
00:48:11,620 --> 00:48:12,790
But you gonna love this.

669
00:48:12,790 --> 00:48:17,420
Mike Stempt visit Forster four
times over the last six weeks.

670
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:19,960
Mike Stempt. What was his reason?

671
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:22,330
Research. He had written permission.

672
00:48:22,330 --> 00:48:24,670
No, no, no. I didn't
give him any permission.

673
00:48:24,670 --> 00:48:26,210
Written or otherwise.

674
00:48:26,330 --> 00:48:29,540
Well, it's your signature,
Jack. I got a copy right here.

675
00:48:30,750 --> 00:48:32,540
Hold on. That... Hold on a second.

676
00:48:32,540 --> 00:48:34,870
That ex boyfriend of
yours. What is his name?

677
00:48:34,870 --> 00:48:36,290
Guy LaForge.

678
00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:39,170
Run a check on a parole
named Guy LaForge.

679
00:48:39,420 --> 00:48:42,210
He served time at Walla
Walla with Forster.

680
00:48:42,540 --> 00:48:45,370
And I'll call you back
when I get to my apartment.

681
00:48:45,370 --> 00:48:46,750
All right.

682
00:48:48,370 --> 00:48:50,250
Do you think that Frank
is working with Forster?

683
00:48:50,250 --> 00:48:51,500
Someone is.

684
00:48:51,710 --> 00:48:53,580
I got you Johnson. Yeah.

685
00:48:54,290 --> 00:48:56,580
They've found a backpack
in your lecture hall.

686
00:48:56,580 --> 00:48:58,250
What? With a bomb in it?

687
00:48:58,540 --> 00:49:02,410
No. A photo, dynamite, and a
time with a note addressed to you.

688
00:49:02,620 --> 00:49:03,750
What did it say?

689
00:49:03,750 --> 00:49:04,950
Tic-Tac.

690
00:49:06,580 --> 00:49:07,950
What does it mean, Jack?

691
00:49:07,950 --> 00:49:09,500
I call you back.

692
00:49:34,410 --> 00:49:36,120
You are okay? Yeah.

693
00:49:36,330 --> 00:49:38,080
What the hell was that?

694
00:49:39,620 --> 00:49:41,870
Probably somebody trying to scare us.

695
00:49:41,950 --> 00:49:44,660
Who do you think would
do something like that?

696
00:49:45,370 --> 00:49:47,870
Does your boyfriend drive a motorcycle?

697
00:49:48,080 --> 00:49:49,410
Yeah.

698
00:49:49,620 --> 00:49:52,160
Except he's not my boyfriend anymore.

699
00:49:52,950 --> 00:49:53,740
Yeah.

700
00:49:53,950 --> 00:49:56,950
How does it feel to know you
won't live through another night?

701
00:49:56,950 --> 00:49:58,120
56 minutes.

702
00:49:58,830 --> 00:50:00,410
Tic-Tac, doc.

703
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:03,370
Let's go.

704
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:52,780
Guy LaForge.

705
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:55,110
He isn't a boyfriend, is he?

706
00:50:57,110 --> 00:51:00,610
The only thing that got me out
of Texas was my books marks.

707
00:51:01,780 --> 00:51:05,150
And when I left for college,
I had that, but not much else.

708
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:08,780
So I tried to fit in. I drank too much.

709
00:51:10,490 --> 00:51:12,070
Thought too little.

710
00:51:12,690 --> 00:51:14,400
And I met Guy.

711
00:51:17,990 --> 00:51:19,990
And he was this English...

712
00:51:20,490 --> 00:51:23,110
Working class rock star wanna be.

713
00:51:23,190 --> 00:51:25,070
And I fell for him.

714
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:28,150
And I married him...

715
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:29,780
When I graduated.

716
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:35,440
He didn't take to well to my
aspirations for higher education.

717
00:51:35,860 --> 00:51:39,690
In fact he didn't really want me to
leave the house. And when I disobeyed...

718
00:51:39,690 --> 00:51:42,610
He got filthy drunk and he beat me.

719
00:51:43,110 --> 00:51:45,730
That's when he got
arrested and I divorced him.

720
00:51:45,730 --> 00:51:48,730
I've been trying to make
up for lost time ever since.

721
00:51:54,110 --> 00:51:57,440
You know, Forster is trying to
kill me. Forster is in prison.

722
00:51:57,480 --> 00:52:00,730
Yeah, I know. He's got someone
on the outside trying to...

723
00:52:01,150 --> 00:52:02,820
To do the job.

724
00:52:05,980 --> 00:52:07,480
He's gonna kill me.

725
00:52:09,110 --> 00:52:11,020
If I don't get him first.

726
00:52:16,560 --> 00:52:19,320
Whoever is working with
Forster must be close to you.

727
00:52:19,320 --> 00:52:22,690
A friend even. I don't
have many friends.

728
00:52:22,860 --> 00:52:24,020
That's a plus.

729
00:52:24,020 --> 00:52:27,480
It's a real pleasure to look at everyone
you know as your would be murderer.

730
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:29,940
Paranoia is a normal state of mind, huh?

731
00:52:31,560 --> 00:52:32,770
Where is Errol?

732
00:52:32,770 --> 00:52:35,690
I don't know. I'm a
temp. The agency sent me.

733
00:52:36,270 --> 00:52:37,810
Dr. Gramm?

734
00:52:38,190 --> 00:52:39,940
There's a package for you.

735
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:45,150
How did you know my name?

736
00:52:45,150 --> 00:52:47,690
I don't. It was a question.

737
00:52:49,310 --> 00:52:50,480
Yeah.

738
00:52:51,350 --> 00:52:53,770
There's no returning
address on this? No.

739
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:56,810
Who delivered it?

740
00:52:56,980 --> 00:53:00,310
A carrier. But there was another
person here at the same time...

741
00:53:00,310 --> 00:53:02,520
Iooking for you. Who?

742
00:53:02,730 --> 00:53:05,100
What was his name? No, I didn't get it.

743
00:53:05,190 --> 00:53:07,640
When he walked in I was on
the phone with the plumber.

744
00:53:07,640 --> 00:53:12,850
He said he would be right back. Okay.

745
00:53:12,980 --> 00:53:14,600
You wanna me pull the
surveillance tapes?

746
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:18,640
That shouldn't take more than an hour
to get someone up here with the keys.

747
00:53:19,310 --> 00:53:21,060
I don't have an hour. No?

748
00:53:21,350 --> 00:53:26,100
Hey, you know, he was also wearing
leathers. He had a motorcycle helmet.

749
00:53:26,270 --> 00:53:28,440
That's Guy. He was here.

750
00:53:30,100 --> 00:53:33,140
If he comes back, don't
send him up to my apartment.

751
00:53:33,850 --> 00:53:35,140
Yeah.

752
00:53:35,930 --> 00:53:37,810
Hi, Dr. Gramm. Hi, Eva.

753
00:53:46,810 --> 00:53:49,140
How did Guy know we're going to be here?

754
00:53:49,140 --> 00:53:51,270
How does even know where you live?

755
00:53:51,270 --> 00:53:53,180
Oh, Walther P99.

756
00:53:53,350 --> 00:53:55,770
That would blow a hole through anything.

757
00:53:57,220 --> 00:53:59,470
What? I grew up around guns.

758
00:53:59,770 --> 00:54:03,600
Maybe he didn't know I was gonna be
here, maybe that's why he showed up.

759
00:54:03,930 --> 00:54:06,930
I'll verify where he went
after the party last night.

760
00:54:08,180 --> 00:54:11,430
There's a Lauren Douglas to
see you. Should I send her up?

761
00:54:11,510 --> 00:54:12,890
Okay, send her up.

762
00:54:15,970 --> 00:54:17,930
He got that right, didn't he?

763
00:54:18,260 --> 00:54:19,680
Hey, what's that?

764
00:54:20,350 --> 00:54:21,600
This?

765
00:54:22,180 --> 00:54:23,890
It's a chemical detector.

766
00:54:24,560 --> 00:54:28,600
It sniffs out vapors.
Custom agencies are using it.

767
00:54:29,310 --> 00:54:30,600
And?

768
00:54:36,140 --> 00:54:37,640
It's not a bomb.

769
00:54:38,060 --> 00:54:39,180
That's good.

770
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:40,930
Yeah.

771
00:54:53,140 --> 00:54:54,640
Hi. Hi.

772
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:57,640
Are you okay? Yeah.
I'm better, thank you.

773
00:55:00,180 --> 00:55:03,090
What do you have? I went to
see Shelley like you said.

774
00:55:03,090 --> 00:55:06,430
She tried to fax you over some
papers, but the machine was down.

775
00:55:06,430 --> 00:55:09,760
So I said I'd bring the risk
assessment profiles over myself.

776
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:13,180
I didn't know you had company.

777
00:55:13,590 --> 00:55:16,760
Dale told me how good you're
with her when her dad died.

778
00:55:17,510 --> 00:55:19,340
She was so grateful.

779
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:22,340
Dr. Gramm?

780
00:55:22,510 --> 00:55:23,550
Yeah?

781
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:26,380
If there's anything I can do to
help you find Dale's murderer...

782
00:55:26,380 --> 00:55:28,930
Will you let me know? Of course, yes.

783
00:55:30,050 --> 00:55:31,260
Thank you.

784
00:55:32,430 --> 00:55:35,130
Can I call you a cab or something?

785
00:55:35,430 --> 00:55:37,880
No, Mike is gonna give me a ride.

786
00:55:38,260 --> 00:55:39,720
Okay. Thanks for these...

787
00:55:39,720 --> 00:55:40,840
Bye.

788
00:55:45,050 --> 00:55:47,420
All those people have threatened you?

789
00:55:47,590 --> 00:55:50,380
Well, you know, it
comes with the territory.

790
00:55:51,010 --> 00:55:53,380
How come you never
mention that in class?

791
00:55:54,550 --> 00:55:58,220
How many students end up
going into this field anyway?

792
00:55:58,720 --> 00:56:02,090
Not very many with you
booting all of them.

793
00:56:03,170 --> 00:56:04,050
Yeah.

794
00:56:12,670 --> 00:56:14,760
Can I ask you a personal question?

795
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:16,090
No.

796
00:56:17,300 --> 00:56:19,210
How come you never got married?

797
00:56:19,210 --> 00:56:21,510
I mean, you're a pretty good prospect.

798
00:56:22,090 --> 00:56:24,090
You obviously make a shit load of money.

799
00:56:24,090 --> 00:56:25,340
Why would I get married?

800
00:56:25,340 --> 00:56:27,710
I'm a target for any nut with a grudge.

801
00:56:29,840 --> 00:56:32,130
I can't afford emotional attachments.

802
00:56:32,420 --> 00:56:34,210
Yeah, but don't you want kids?

803
00:56:34,210 --> 00:56:35,880
Don't you want a family?

804
00:56:35,960 --> 00:56:37,590
I'm too old for kids.

805
00:56:40,710 --> 00:56:43,130
You're too young for me, Kim.

806
00:56:46,210 --> 00:56:50,250
If you want me to leave, Jack, all
you've got to do is say it and I'm gone.

807
00:56:50,380 --> 00:56:52,290
No, I don't want you to leave.

808
00:56:52,750 --> 00:56:54,130
I need you, Kim.

809
00:56:54,250 --> 00:56:56,460
You are smart and you
are important to me.

810
00:56:56,460 --> 00:56:58,290
Really, you are.

811
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:02,130
Okay.

812
00:57:20,790 --> 00:57:22,830
Yeah. Jack, it's Shelley.

813
00:57:22,830 --> 00:57:24,580
What the hell happened to
you? Where have you been

814
00:57:24,580 --> 00:57:27,710
Making calls for you, four lines
simultaneously. The fax is down.

815
00:57:27,710 --> 00:57:30,170
I know, Lauren Douglas came over
and brought some papers with her.

816
00:57:30,170 --> 00:57:32,120
Jack, you better turn on MS-NBC.

817
00:57:32,120 --> 00:57:32,870
Why?

818
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:35,830
Forster got a judge to grant
his request for an interview.

819
00:57:35,830 --> 00:57:36,960
He's on, live.

820
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:39,170
This is gonna heat things up

821
00:57:39,170 --> 00:57:40,330
When looking for a home...

822
00:57:40,330 --> 00:57:44,210
A real estate agent is really important
in you life. You need someone...

823
00:57:44,670 --> 00:57:46,250
Shelley. Listen to me.

824
00:57:46,330 --> 00:57:49,790
I want you to send some of the
boys to my apartment, all right?

825
00:57:49,790 --> 00:57:53,460
There may be someone down at my lobby
in biker leathers when they get there.

826
00:57:53,460 --> 00:57:54,410
Okay?

827
00:57:55,040 --> 00:57:57,790
You got a name? Yes,
his name is Guy LaForge.

828
00:57:58,250 --> 00:58:02,620
Put a photo on the FBI wire, okay?

829
00:58:02,830 --> 00:58:05,160
If you are not granted another
stay of the execution...

830
00:58:05,160 --> 00:58:06,830
Are you prepared to die?

831
00:58:06,830 --> 00:58:07,870
You want me to call the police?

832
00:58:07,870 --> 00:58:10,750
No, no, let Frank handle
it. He'll know what to do.

833
00:58:10,870 --> 00:58:13,120
As prepared as any man can be to
pay for something he didn't do.

834
00:58:13,120 --> 00:58:14,210
Listen.

835
00:58:14,410 --> 00:58:17,950
You didn't message over a
package to my apartment, did you?

836
00:58:18,210 --> 00:58:18,910
No.

837
00:58:19,080 --> 00:58:21,790
There is a lot of people out there
that believe in your innocence.

838
00:58:21,790 --> 00:58:22,790
And I'm grateful.

839
00:58:22,790 --> 00:58:24,290
You know anyone that might have?

840
00:58:24,290 --> 00:58:26,330
No. I'm grateful for their prayers.

841
00:58:26,330 --> 00:58:28,540
Everything goes to your
office. And support.

842
00:58:28,540 --> 00:58:30,950
What about Pollard.
Find anything on her?

843
00:58:31,290 --> 00:58:33,000
You didn't actually
paid her, did you, Jack?

844
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,870
Pay her, what do you mean?
She works for a escort service.

845
00:58:35,870 --> 00:58:37,330
Escort service?

846
00:58:37,660 --> 00:58:39,330
You didn't know?

847
00:58:39,750 --> 00:58:41,160
No, I didn't know.

848
00:58:43,450 --> 00:58:46,990
What? She told me she was
a lawyer. A student lawyer.

849
00:58:47,540 --> 00:58:49,620
What are your thoughts this time?

850
00:58:49,620 --> 00:58:52,540
Well, Stephanie, that's one
thing I don't have a lot of...

851
00:58:52,540 --> 00:58:54,330
You got a number for her?

852
00:58:55,700 --> 00:58:57,200
Yeah, a phone number and the address.

853
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:58,620
I know the address.

854
00:58:59,330 --> 00:59:00,490
Let me have the number.

855
00:59:00,490 --> 00:59:02,700
If Dr. Gramm was with us right
now, what would you say to him?

856
00:59:02,700 --> 00:59:05,530
555-1352.

857
00:59:05,700 --> 00:59:07,700
He knows that I didn't do this.

858
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:09,280
There's only one... Thanks.

859
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:13,330
Other person in this world
who knows I've been framed.

860
00:59:13,530 --> 00:59:17,700
That it was a set up.
That I'm totally innocent.

861
00:59:18,450 --> 00:59:22,580
And that would be the forensic
psychiatric Dr. Jack Gramm.

862
00:59:23,450 --> 00:59:26,580
I guess what I'd say to Jack
Gramm... I'd say, "Why me"?

863
00:59:28,450 --> 00:59:31,950
I understand that you've suffered
a great loss with your sister.

864
00:59:31,950 --> 00:59:34,450
I feel your pain, Dr. Gramm.

865
00:59:34,870 --> 00:59:36,740
Pick it up, damn it. But
that doesn't exonerate you...

866
00:59:36,740 --> 00:59:41,160
From false accusing me of things that
you know I did not, could not have done.

867
00:59:41,240 --> 00:59:42,450
Pick up, Sara.

868
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:45,910
If I can be convicted of this
voodoo forensic science...

869
00:59:45,910 --> 00:59:47,740
Think about it... Who is safe?

870
00:59:50,610 --> 00:59:51,740
Shelley?

871
00:59:52,030 --> 00:59:54,280
Shelley? I want you to get MS-NBC.

872
00:59:54,360 --> 00:59:57,490
I want to talk to that
son-Of-Bitch. I would be the last.

873
00:59:57,490 --> 00:59:59,320
Jack, I really don't
think that's a good idea.

874
00:59:59,320 --> 01:00:03,030
It's a good idea. Just get them and
when you get them call me back, OK?

875
01:00:03,030 --> 01:00:06,530
But I find hard to believe that
Dr. Jack Gramm can be out there...

876
01:00:06,530 --> 01:00:10,110
Psycho battling innocent
people into the death chamber.

877
01:00:10,660 --> 01:00:12,490
Who is the murder now, Jack?

878
01:00:13,360 --> 01:00:14,200
Yeah?

879
01:00:14,780 --> 01:00:16,320
Who is the murder now?

880
01:00:16,570 --> 01:00:18,030
Jack?

881
01:00:18,320 --> 01:00:20,650
We got D'Franco in custody.

882
01:00:20,900 --> 01:00:22,400
I got the warrant.

883
01:00:22,610 --> 01:00:24,820
The guys are on the
way over to his place.

884
01:00:24,820 --> 01:00:26,780
Did he say anything about Forster?

885
01:00:26,780 --> 01:00:28,740
A quite bit, but nothing useful.

886
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:30,780
What about Guy LaForge?

887
01:00:30,780 --> 01:00:34,030
He hasn't checked in with his
parole office in six weeks.

888
01:00:34,280 --> 01:00:37,570
Well, he was at my apartment
building less than an hour ago.

889
01:00:37,570 --> 01:00:39,440
And he said he's coming back.

890
01:00:40,280 --> 01:00:41,990
Listen, Frank.

891
01:00:42,240 --> 01:00:44,360
I got a call a little while ago...

892
01:00:44,490 --> 01:00:46,650
Saying I have 88 minutes to live.

893
01:00:46,690 --> 01:00:49,490
Jesus, Jack. Why 88 minutes?

894
01:00:54,730 --> 01:00:56,230
I don't know.

895
01:00:57,610 --> 01:00:59,860
You have any idea who this caller is?

896
01:01:02,570 --> 01:01:07,230
You better find Guy LaForge
before he gets here, okay?

897
01:01:07,360 --> 01:01:09,320
Listen, let me call you back.

898
01:01:09,480 --> 01:01:10,570
Jack?

899
01:01:11,650 --> 01:01:12,320
Shit.

900
01:01:29,940 --> 01:01:31,110
Mom.

901
01:01:31,360 --> 01:01:32,860
Dad.

902
01:01:33,110 --> 01:01:34,360
Jack.

903
01:01:35,020 --> 01:01:36,650
There's someone in here.

904
01:01:36,650 --> 01:01:38,610
And he wants to talk to you.

905
01:01:39,190 --> 01:01:40,610
Where are you?

906
01:01:40,730 --> 01:01:42,860
Please, come home quickly!

907
01:01:43,020 --> 01:01:44,980
I'm here with a man.

908
01:01:45,310 --> 01:01:47,520
It is not what you want me to say...

909
01:01:48,270 --> 01:01:52,110
Jack, come here now! Help me. Help me.

910
01:02:05,190 --> 01:02:06,730
Jack, what is that?

911
01:02:08,310 --> 01:02:09,690
My sister.

912
01:02:10,520 --> 01:02:11,940
Oh, my God!

913
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:16,310
That's horrible. Who
would send that to you?

914
01:02:18,980 --> 01:02:21,650
There's only two copies
of this tape in the world.

915
01:02:21,650 --> 01:02:23,020
One is...

916
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:26,270
Iocked up in custody of NYPD.

917
01:02:26,310 --> 01:02:27,650
And the other...

918
01:02:29,980 --> 01:02:33,060
Is in a restricted access room...

919
01:02:33,230 --> 01:02:35,310
In my office file cabinet...

920
01:02:37,060 --> 01:02:39,520
With the highest security measures.

921
01:02:39,560 --> 01:02:41,640
So you're thinking it was stolen.

922
01:02:41,810 --> 01:02:43,770
Of course it was stolen.

923
01:02:50,940 --> 01:02:52,430
You think I stole it?

924
01:02:54,140 --> 01:02:55,770
You think I stole it?

925
01:02:55,980 --> 01:02:57,930
You left the bar
yesterday night with Dale.

926
01:02:57,930 --> 01:03:01,180
One of the last people to
see her alive. Maybe the last.

927
01:03:01,390 --> 01:03:05,680
Jack, you think I stole
the tape and killed Dale?

928
01:03:05,890 --> 01:03:07,430
Have you lost your mind?

929
01:03:07,430 --> 01:03:10,350
I don't have clearance to
your restricted access room.

930
01:03:10,350 --> 01:03:12,850
Why Guy LaForge was
at the bar last night?

931
01:03:14,470 --> 01:03:16,520
He was trying to protect me.

932
01:03:16,850 --> 01:03:18,100
From what?

933
01:03:19,560 --> 01:03:22,260
From you. From me? He knows about me?

934
01:03:22,350 --> 01:03:24,140
Yes. What does he know about me?

935
01:03:24,140 --> 01:03:27,310
He knows I have a silly
girlish crush on you.

936
01:03:28,350 --> 01:03:29,930
Jack. Hold on a second.

937
01:03:30,060 --> 01:03:32,890
I just got an email
from Mike Stempt, okay?

938
01:03:33,140 --> 01:03:35,890
He saw Guy at Darby's Club last night.

939
01:03:36,100 --> 01:03:38,600
When Mike left at 3 am, Guy
was still sitting there...

940
01:03:38,600 --> 01:03:40,930
And they've bounced a beer until 6 am.

941
01:03:41,140 --> 01:03:44,260
So there's no way that Guy
could have killed Dale Morris.

942
01:03:52,760 --> 01:03:55,600
Yeah? Did you listen
to the tape, Dr. Gramm?

943
01:03:55,810 --> 01:03:58,350
Why did you leave the
little Katie all alone?

944
01:03:58,350 --> 01:03:59,800
Why, Dr. Gramm?

945
01:04:00,010 --> 01:04:04,260
She'd still be alive today if you
hadn't left her all alone to die.

946
01:04:05,220 --> 01:04:09,100
Now it's your turn. In a glaze of glory!

947
01:04:09,430 --> 01:04:10,850
Tic-Tac, doc.

948
01:04:11,100 --> 01:04:12,550
You have 37 minutes.

949
01:04:25,680 --> 01:04:26,510
Yeah?

950
01:04:26,640 --> 01:04:29,930
Hey, Jack, I got MS-NBC on the line.
I'll patch you through the prison.

951
01:04:29,930 --> 01:04:32,760
You're sure you wanna do this? Shelley.

952
01:04:33,680 --> 01:04:37,930
There's been a breach in my
place, in my most secure area.

953
01:04:38,340 --> 01:04:42,220
Did you ever give anyone clearance
to go into my secure files?

954
01:04:42,340 --> 01:04:43,630
Jack, what are you saying?

955
01:04:43,630 --> 01:04:47,090
Did you ever let an
unauthorized person...

956
01:04:47,180 --> 01:04:49,130
Into my secure files area?

957
01:04:49,340 --> 01:04:52,130
No, never. To anyone.

958
01:04:52,260 --> 01:04:53,050
Ever.

959
01:04:53,300 --> 01:04:54,430
Okay.

960
01:04:55,430 --> 01:04:58,050
Now put me through the MS-NBC.

961
01:05:03,630 --> 01:05:04,920
Frank?

962
01:05:04,920 --> 01:05:08,260
Yeah. Yeah, turn on the MSN-BC.

963
01:05:08,510 --> 01:05:11,670
They've granted Forster
a live interview.

964
01:05:11,970 --> 01:05:13,760
I can't, Jack, I'm in the car.

965
01:05:13,760 --> 01:05:18,010
It's all right. They also will
cast. You just turn on 750 AM.

966
01:05:18,340 --> 01:05:19,590
I'm phoning in.

967
01:05:20,010 --> 01:05:23,170
Wait a second. You think is such a
good idea? With all the court actions?

968
01:05:23,170 --> 01:05:26,550
I think he's behind everything. I think
he's behind the phone calls, threats...

969
01:05:26,550 --> 01:05:29,590
I'm gonna try to get inside
his head. Make him crack.

970
01:05:29,630 --> 01:05:32,050
Okay? You wanna stay
on the line, please?

971
01:05:32,760 --> 01:05:34,380
Dr. Gramm? Yeah.

972
01:05:34,510 --> 01:05:35,260
You're on the air.

973
01:05:35,260 --> 01:05:39,130
I've been told that we have
Dr. Gramm joining us by phone.

974
01:05:39,170 --> 01:05:41,460
Dr. Gramm, are you there? I'm here.

975
01:05:41,710 --> 01:05:43,380
Have you been watching the interview?

976
01:05:43,380 --> 01:05:46,000
Is that what you call it?
What would you call it?

977
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,550
I don't know, I don't call it an
interview. I call it an entertainment.

978
01:05:48,550 --> 01:05:50,550
I call it a performance, maybe.

979
01:05:50,630 --> 01:05:52,920
You must have got something to
say or you wouldn't have called in.

980
01:05:52,920 --> 01:05:56,840
Oh, yeah, I think it's very interesting
that Forster talks about forgiveness.

981
01:05:56,840 --> 01:05:59,960
I just want him to know that his
victims have not forgiven him.

982
01:05:59,960 --> 01:06:02,210
Look, you've lied under oath,
Dr. Gramm, and you know it.

983
01:06:02,210 --> 01:06:05,290
This is not about me. This
about the women you've raped...

984
01:06:05,290 --> 01:06:07,000
And tortured and murdered.

985
01:06:07,170 --> 01:06:10,340
Women like Janie Kay. I have
nothing to do with her death...

986
01:06:10,340 --> 01:06:12,170
And you know it. Nothing
to do with her death?

987
01:06:12,170 --> 01:06:15,750
There was an eyewitness, a
twin sister who identified you.

988
01:06:15,960 --> 01:06:17,840
She was at the scene and identified you.

989
01:06:17,840 --> 01:06:19,590
She was drugged and beaten so badly...

990
01:06:19,590 --> 01:06:21,670
She said that she couldn't
be sure, but you...

991
01:06:21,670 --> 01:06:23,670
You bereaved her until
she said it was me.

992
01:06:23,670 --> 01:06:25,290
Interesting that you didn't
say that you're innocent.

993
01:06:25,290 --> 01:06:28,420
I had nothing to do with the death...
No, I don't. I know you're convicted.

994
01:06:28,420 --> 01:06:30,250
You're convicted by a jury.

995
01:06:30,290 --> 01:06:32,250
You were trialed and
convicted, that's what I know.

996
01:06:32,250 --> 01:06:34,420
Trial? That wasn't a trial,
that was an inquisition.

997
01:06:34,420 --> 01:06:35,580
And the jury believed your lies.

998
01:06:35,580 --> 01:06:39,710
You had to cause pain, suffer and
death, so you could feel alive.

999
01:06:39,920 --> 01:06:40,710
Wait a second.

1000
01:06:40,710 --> 01:06:43,250
Pain and suffer is something that
you, forensics, know how to inflict.

1001
01:06:43,250 --> 01:06:47,460
Even your idol, Ted Bundy,
ultimately, identified his victims.

1002
01:06:47,670 --> 01:06:50,290
How about, man, identify your victims?

1003
01:06:50,500 --> 01:06:51,210
How about?

1004
01:06:51,210 --> 01:06:56,830
The bodies of Terry Hines, Alicia Smith,
Samantha Green. Where are they, man?

1005
01:06:57,040 --> 01:06:58,210
Come on, where are they?

1006
01:06:58,210 --> 01:07:01,920
Give these people's families
closure, man! Give them closure.

1007
01:07:01,960 --> 01:07:05,370
You're on national television now!
Millions of people are watching you.

1008
01:07:05,370 --> 01:07:05,960
Come on!

1009
01:07:05,960 --> 01:07:09,000
How about your colleague in
London, in the Clark case?

1010
01:07:09,160 --> 01:07:12,620
Putting in an innocent mother
for murdering her baby? Well done!

1011
01:07:12,910 --> 01:07:17,000
Well done, doctor. You must be so proud
of being part of an elite fortunate.

1012
01:07:17,410 --> 01:07:19,500
Fortunately for her, her
conviction was overturned...

1013
01:07:19,500 --> 01:07:22,870
When the doctor's testimony
turned out to be an absurd.

1014
01:07:23,080 --> 01:07:24,660
Quack, quack, Dr. Gramm?

1015
01:07:24,660 --> 01:07:26,000
You now what?

1016
01:07:26,210 --> 01:07:28,660
Why don't you take a
good look at your watch?

1017
01:07:28,660 --> 01:07:30,040
A good look.

1018
01:07:30,750 --> 01:07:34,870
Now imagine what it'd be like to
be minutes away from your own death.

1019
01:07:35,830 --> 01:07:37,370
To hear the ticking of a clock...

1020
01:07:37,370 --> 01:07:40,370
And know that your time on
earth is drying to a close.

1021
01:07:42,160 --> 01:07:43,370
Thank you.

1022
01:07:45,080 --> 01:07:48,540
There's another package for you,
Dr. Gramm. Should I send it up?

1023
01:07:48,540 --> 01:07:50,330
This has just got in.

1024
01:07:50,540 --> 01:07:54,250
A three judge panel of the Nine
Circuit has just granted John Forster...

1025
01:07:54,250 --> 01:07:55,910
A stay of the execution.

1026
01:07:57,540 --> 01:07:58,580
What?

1027
01:08:01,830 --> 01:08:03,120
Are you serious?

1028
01:08:08,370 --> 01:08:09,830
You hear that, Frank?

1029
01:08:09,830 --> 01:08:11,040
Yeah, I heard.

1030
01:08:11,490 --> 01:08:12,950
Forster got the stay.

1031
01:08:13,280 --> 01:08:16,450
I got him going, didn't I? No cigar.

1032
01:08:16,910 --> 01:08:19,830
Why did you send me on
a wild goose chase, Jack?

1033
01:08:19,990 --> 01:08:21,200
What do you mean, wild goose chase?

1034
01:08:21,200 --> 01:08:24,160
D'Franco is not a serial
killer, he's a serial groupie.

1035
01:08:24,160 --> 01:08:26,700
So he's a groupie so
what? What's the big deal?

1036
01:08:26,700 --> 01:08:29,580
I've just got a call from Jeremy
Guber from attorney general office.

1037
01:08:29,580 --> 01:08:32,870
You are wanted for questioning
on the murder of Dale Morris.

1038
01:08:32,870 --> 01:08:34,950
What? What are you talking about?

1039
01:08:35,240 --> 01:08:39,080
They've found physical evidence at her
apartment that implicates you, Jack.

1040
01:08:39,080 --> 01:08:39,990
What evidence?

1041
01:08:39,990 --> 01:08:41,030
Jack...

1042
01:08:41,620 --> 01:08:43,330
You know I can't say.

1043
01:08:43,530 --> 01:08:46,410
What you mean, you can't
say? What does that mean?

1044
01:08:46,740 --> 01:08:49,450
Frank? There's someone to see you...

1045
01:08:49,530 --> 01:08:51,450
Mister, you can't go up there.

1046
01:08:52,120 --> 01:08:53,820
You told the doorman
to don't let anyone up.

1047
01:08:53,820 --> 01:08:57,280
It's all right, don't worry.
Don't worry, no-One is getting in.

1048
01:09:04,280 --> 01:09:07,570
The state attorney general has
just announced that his appealing...

1049
01:09:07,570 --> 01:09:09,860
Is taken to the State
Supreme Court immediately.

1050
01:09:09,860 --> 01:09:10,990
Jack. There's smoke.

1051
01:09:10,990 --> 01:09:13,910
We'll keep you informed
with further developments.

1052
01:09:16,570 --> 01:09:18,320
There's smoke here too.

1053
01:09:34,740 --> 01:09:36,150
It's your boyfriend.

1054
01:09:36,360 --> 01:09:37,570
Let Kim go.

1055
01:09:37,780 --> 01:09:39,320
Let her go now and
no-One will get hurt.

1056
01:09:39,320 --> 01:09:42,280
Guy, I'm fine. There's no problem here.

1057
01:09:42,490 --> 01:09:44,950
The building is on
fire. That's a problem.

1058
01:09:45,150 --> 01:09:47,200
He's got a gun. Okay. Listen to me.

1059
01:09:47,200 --> 01:09:49,740
I know this man and I know
he's not gonna hurt me again.

1060
01:09:49,740 --> 01:09:51,900
You have to trust me,
Jack. Please, open the door.

1061
01:09:51,900 --> 01:09:54,440
Do it quickly. There's
smoke up here. Kim.

1062
01:09:54,530 --> 01:09:58,110
Guy, I'm coming out. We
can calm things down, okay?

1063
01:09:59,650 --> 01:10:02,530
Guy, look at me. I'm fine.
There's no problem here.

1064
01:10:02,740 --> 01:10:06,320
What are you doing with him?
I'm okay. There's no problem.

1065
01:10:08,650 --> 01:10:11,280
Guy has been shot. No!

1066
01:10:20,360 --> 01:10:22,900
On the roof there's a fire escape. Okay?

1067
01:10:23,110 --> 01:10:26,030
When I say "go", follow me. Okay.

1068
01:10:43,820 --> 01:10:45,820
Do you think he is dead?

1069
01:10:46,020 --> 01:10:49,070
He doesn't look good. We
should go back up there.

1070
01:10:49,650 --> 01:10:51,860
I gotta go back there and help him.

1071
01:10:52,020 --> 01:10:54,730
No. You can't go up there. Man.

1072
01:10:55,980 --> 01:10:57,980
Yeah? Jack, I need to talk to you.

1073
01:10:57,980 --> 01:11:00,150
I need two minutes to clarify something?

1074
01:11:00,150 --> 01:11:01,860
Shelley, I can't talk now.

1075
01:11:01,860 --> 01:11:04,980
I'll talk to you when I get
to Sara Pollard apartment.

1076
01:11:08,110 --> 01:11:10,480
Miss. Lewinsky. Are you okay?

1077
01:11:10,610 --> 01:11:12,730
I'm just a little bit dizzy. Come.

1078
01:11:16,310 --> 01:11:18,900
Because I didn't see
a device with a timer.

1079
01:11:19,060 --> 01:11:21,150
Get the bomb squad,
this is the second one.

1080
01:11:21,150 --> 01:11:22,270
Go.

1081
01:11:25,350 --> 01:11:27,850
Get her some oxygen. All
right. We got her, sir.

1082
01:11:27,850 --> 01:11:30,350
Let's go outside. You
gonna be all right.

1083
01:11:37,690 --> 01:11:40,230
Jack, I don't see the shooter, do you?

1084
01:11:41,560 --> 01:11:42,350
Jack.

1085
01:11:42,480 --> 01:11:44,690
He's got a gun. Where?

1086
01:11:45,140 --> 01:11:46,690
Where the hell is he?

1087
01:11:46,850 --> 01:11:48,270
Where? Jack!

1088
01:11:48,600 --> 01:11:50,020
Get down!

1089
01:11:55,230 --> 01:11:56,560
Kim! Keep moving!

1090
01:11:56,600 --> 01:11:58,020
Kim, where are you?

1091
01:12:15,020 --> 01:12:16,390
Go, go, go!

1092
01:12:16,680 --> 01:12:18,180
Move back!

1093
01:12:18,560 --> 01:12:21,560
Are you okay? Yeah, I'm gonna live.

1094
01:12:22,270 --> 01:12:23,810
Here, let's go.

1095
01:12:24,180 --> 01:12:25,560
Where are we going?

1096
01:12:26,310 --> 01:12:28,060
To Sara Pollard house.

1097
01:12:28,230 --> 01:12:30,520
She's the girl I was with last night.

1098
01:12:31,890 --> 01:12:34,140
That's funny. It worked in the garage.

1099
01:12:39,390 --> 01:12:40,810
Why did you do that?

1100
01:12:40,930 --> 01:12:43,010
I don't know. I had a feeling...

1101
01:13:01,310 --> 01:13:02,600
Are you okay?

1102
01:13:06,720 --> 01:13:08,140
What next?

1103
01:13:09,220 --> 01:13:10,560
I don't know.

1104
01:13:14,970 --> 01:13:17,100
Okay, let's get out of here. Okay.

1105
01:13:24,220 --> 01:13:26,010
Is that your cab? Yeah.

1106
01:13:26,180 --> 01:13:28,350
Okay. I give you a hundred bucks...

1107
01:13:28,350 --> 01:13:30,680
You let me drive it. I'm
just going across town.

1108
01:13:30,680 --> 01:13:31,930
A hundred bucks?

1109
01:13:32,430 --> 01:13:35,220
A hundred bucks plus tip. How is that?

1110
01:13:35,470 --> 01:13:36,640
All right.

1111
01:13:49,930 --> 01:13:52,050
I can not believe that.

1112
01:13:52,800 --> 01:13:54,050
Guy is dead.

1113
01:13:54,930 --> 01:13:56,260
He is. He is dead.

1114
01:13:58,550 --> 01:13:59,680
Shit.

1115
01:14:04,840 --> 01:14:06,590
You have not to say, huh?

1116
01:14:06,680 --> 01:14:09,800
It's just another day in
the life of Jack Gramm.

1117
01:14:12,130 --> 01:14:16,340
Was I actually fooling myself into thinking
I can have a relationship with you?

1118
01:14:21,470 --> 01:14:25,630
Now, I've enough common sense
to figure this out. I mean, what was I thinking?

1119
01:14:44,800 --> 01:14:46,010
Okay.

1120
01:14:47,760 --> 01:14:50,260
Can you wait outside
the cab for a minute?

1121
01:14:51,090 --> 01:14:52,630
You bet. Thanks.

1122
01:14:57,710 --> 01:14:59,800
You asked me about my kid sister.

1123
01:15:00,010 --> 01:15:01,880
Okay. It was a long time ago.

1124
01:15:02,210 --> 01:15:04,880
She was staying at my
apartment in New York City.

1125
01:15:04,880 --> 01:15:07,340
She was 12, I was 28.

1126
01:15:07,500 --> 01:15:10,590
And I was late for a meeting.
Very important meeting.

1127
01:15:10,840 --> 01:15:12,880
A meeting that was gonna change my life.

1128
01:15:12,880 --> 01:15:15,670
It was gonna make me
into somebody important.

1129
01:15:17,050 --> 01:15:19,340
Make all my dreams come true, so...

1130
01:15:19,550 --> 01:15:22,130
I went to this meeting
on my dissertation.

1131
01:15:22,500 --> 01:15:25,500
And I left her there by herself.

1132
01:15:25,960 --> 01:15:29,420
I could have taken her with me. I
could have left her with friends.

1133
01:15:29,420 --> 01:15:32,040
I could have postpone the meeting.

1134
01:15:32,460 --> 01:15:35,420
But I chose not to,
because I was in a hurry.

1135
01:15:35,630 --> 01:15:37,710
Anyway, I left her there alone.

1136
01:15:37,960 --> 01:15:40,460
At that time I was working in a case...

1137
01:15:40,670 --> 01:15:43,420
And this guy had strangled six women.

1138
01:15:43,670 --> 01:15:46,170
We were very close to nail him.

1139
01:15:47,210 --> 01:15:49,880
He was upset and he
wanted to get back at me.

1140
01:15:50,080 --> 01:15:53,880
So he came to my apartment,
only I wasn't there.

1141
01:15:54,210 --> 01:15:57,630
And that time I wasn't
concerned with security.

1142
01:15:58,500 --> 01:16:01,080
I was careless so...

1143
01:16:03,630 --> 01:16:05,540
He broke the door down...

1144
01:16:05,540 --> 01:16:07,040
And he went in.

1145
01:16:08,870 --> 01:16:10,130
And did...

1146
01:16:11,120 --> 01:16:12,420
Things...

1147
01:16:13,040 --> 01:16:14,830
To my baby sister.

1148
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,290
Katheryn, was her name.

1149
01:16:18,670 --> 01:16:19,790
Katy.

1150
01:16:20,620 --> 01:16:24,080
He did things that you
wouldn't do to an animal...

1151
01:16:24,170 --> 01:16:26,500
That was bred for slaughter.

1152
01:16:30,710 --> 01:16:31,830
Anyway...

1153
01:16:35,210 --> 01:16:36,790
When they caught him...

1154
01:16:37,620 --> 01:16:39,080
He laughed...

1155
01:16:40,540 --> 01:16:41,870
And said...

1156
01:16:43,160 --> 01:16:45,580
It took him 88 minutes...

1157
01:16:58,330 --> 01:17:01,450
It took him 88 minutes
to have my sister dead.

1158
01:17:01,500 --> 01:17:02,700
Jack...

1159
01:17:05,620 --> 01:17:07,580
He is in prison now.

1160
01:17:10,790 --> 01:17:13,490
Coming up for his fifth parole hearing.

1161
01:17:14,700 --> 01:17:16,660
I left New York.

1162
01:17:16,910 --> 01:17:20,080
Left all that behind me
and came here, to Seattle.

1163
01:17:20,580 --> 01:17:23,700
You know, it seemed the perfect place.

1164
01:17:24,950 --> 01:17:26,870
It's on the far off corner...

1165
01:17:28,330 --> 01:17:30,330
Of the continent of USA.

1166
01:17:30,740 --> 01:17:33,370
To see if I had a second hanged in me.

1167
01:17:36,830 --> 01:17:38,580
Whoever stole that tape...

1168
01:17:39,450 --> 01:17:41,740
Knows the meaning of 88 minutes.

1169
01:17:47,620 --> 01:17:48,990
Is that enough?

1170
01:17:52,660 --> 01:17:53,830
Let's go.

1171
01:18:03,700 --> 01:18:06,280
If Sara is not home, we
don't have a search warrant.

1172
01:18:06,280 --> 01:18:08,910
Well, we don't need a search warrant.
We're not gonna arrest anybody.

1173
01:18:08,910 --> 01:18:10,700
We're just breaking in.

1174
01:18:15,530 --> 01:18:17,280
Not a good sign.

1175
01:18:20,450 --> 01:18:22,660
You can't say I've
never give you anything.

1176
01:18:22,660 --> 01:18:25,320
This looks familiar.
When did you take it?

1177
01:18:26,370 --> 01:18:28,360
I guess it doesn't matter, does it?

1178
01:18:28,360 --> 01:18:29,820
It just might.

1179
01:18:34,030 --> 01:18:36,110
Okay, check out that way. Okay.

1180
01:19:18,440 --> 01:19:19,440
Oh, Jesus.

1181
01:19:23,740 --> 01:19:25,110
What is it?

1182
01:19:26,740 --> 01:19:28,030
Oh, my God.

1183
01:19:28,530 --> 01:19:30,110
Oh, my God!

1184
01:19:31,150 --> 01:19:32,190
Calm, Kim.

1185
01:19:32,320 --> 01:19:35,320
Calm, Kim. Oh, my God. She is dead.

1186
01:19:36,150 --> 01:19:37,110
It's okay.

1187
01:19:37,190 --> 01:19:40,570
Who would do that? Why? Calm, Kim.

1188
01:19:40,650 --> 01:19:43,570
Who could torture someone
like that? Just, breathe.

1189
01:19:44,980 --> 01:19:46,690
Breathe, breathe. Okay.

1190
01:19:47,480 --> 01:19:49,070
Breathe. Oh, God.

1191
01:19:49,110 --> 01:19:51,320
Control. Take control. Okay.

1192
01:19:52,320 --> 01:19:53,980
I'm in control.

1193
01:19:54,190 --> 01:19:56,480
Are you in control? Yeah.

1194
01:19:56,570 --> 01:19:59,230
Okay, good. Let me show
you something. Okay.

1195
01:20:00,070 --> 01:20:01,820
That is my signature.

1196
01:20:02,730 --> 01:20:05,820
Forged. Credit card receipt.

1197
01:20:06,190 --> 01:20:08,570
This whole place is filled with my DNA.

1198
01:20:08,820 --> 01:20:10,690
The police is gonna come here.

1199
01:20:10,860 --> 01:20:14,570
They gonna know I was with Sara.
They gonna think that I killed her.

1200
01:20:15,730 --> 01:20:16,940
Your phone. Yeah.

1201
01:20:16,940 --> 01:20:18,360
Answer, Jack.

1202
01:20:20,860 --> 01:20:22,190
Yeah.

1203
01:20:22,480 --> 01:20:24,270
Jack? Carol?

1204
01:20:25,020 --> 01:20:26,020
Carol?

1205
01:20:26,270 --> 01:20:29,610
Did you here the tape with your
sister's 88 minutes of suffering?

1206
01:20:29,610 --> 01:20:31,940
I sent it to your apartment.

1207
01:20:32,900 --> 01:20:35,310
What are you saying,
Carol? What is this?

1208
01:20:35,480 --> 01:20:37,310
The Porsche was a close call.

1209
01:20:38,650 --> 01:20:42,350
I called Frank and told him you
murdered Sara after you killed Dale.

1210
01:20:44,560 --> 01:20:46,310
Think you are so smart...

1211
01:20:46,690 --> 01:20:48,600
Invincible and unbeatable.

1212
01:20:49,100 --> 01:20:53,100
John Forster is giving you a death
sentence and he is about to be free.

1213
01:20:53,940 --> 01:20:55,230
How ironic.

1214
01:20:56,440 --> 01:20:58,640
You've got 18 minutes left.

1215
01:20:59,190 --> 01:21:01,020
Meet me at your office alone.

1216
01:21:01,190 --> 01:21:02,690
Tic-Tac.

1217
01:21:04,810 --> 01:21:06,140
What is it?

1218
01:21:06,230 --> 01:21:07,770
It's Carol.

1219
01:21:08,850 --> 01:21:12,440
She wants to meet me at the
university, at my office.

1220
01:21:13,770 --> 01:21:14,890
Let's go.

1221
01:21:15,480 --> 01:21:16,770
Come on. Okay.

1222
01:21:35,020 --> 01:21:37,640
Shelley? What the hell
are you doing in here?

1223
01:21:38,430 --> 01:21:40,100
I need to talk to you.

1224
01:21:43,020 --> 01:21:46,100
That poor girl. That poor... poor girl.

1225
01:21:48,770 --> 01:21:50,470
It was me. Sit, sit.

1226
01:21:50,520 --> 01:21:53,220
It was me. Shelley, sit down.

1227
01:21:54,680 --> 01:21:57,680
I broke the security protocol.

1228
01:22:00,510 --> 01:22:01,640
Why?

1229
01:22:03,930 --> 01:22:05,760
Well, about six weeks ago...

1230
01:22:05,810 --> 01:22:09,890
I had a drink in your office
with a student of yours.

1231
01:22:10,600 --> 01:22:12,060
A couple of drinks, actually.

1232
01:22:12,060 --> 01:22:16,180
And she made an advance, and...

1233
01:22:17,680 --> 01:22:21,180
It was late, but the office was
jammed with people working still.

1234
01:22:23,180 --> 01:22:27,600
And when we woke up she left.
She didn't have a briefcase...

1235
01:22:27,680 --> 01:22:29,890
She didn't have anything she
could put the tape in, but...

1236
01:22:29,890 --> 01:22:31,800
But somebody else must have.

1237
01:22:32,050 --> 01:22:34,930
Somebody else did, while we're sleeping.

1238
01:22:35,140 --> 01:22:38,010
Who was this girl? What's her name?

1239
01:22:40,100 --> 01:22:41,300
It was Lauren.

1240
01:22:42,470 --> 01:22:44,050
Lauren Douglas.

1241
01:22:47,600 --> 01:22:49,010
And here is the...

1242
01:22:50,220 --> 01:22:51,800
It's a picture from
the security cameras.

1243
01:22:51,800 --> 01:22:54,800
This is the person that must
have rifle through my files...

1244
01:22:54,800 --> 01:22:57,680
And found the combination to
your vault and took the tape.

1245
01:22:57,680 --> 01:23:00,260
That's not a person, Shelly.
It's a hat and a coat.

1246
01:23:00,260 --> 01:23:05,680
And this the photo ID of everyone that
has visited Forster on the last month.

1247
01:23:07,220 --> 01:23:08,260
Oh...

1248
01:23:09,930 --> 01:23:11,890
Can you ever forgive me?

1249
01:23:14,970 --> 01:23:17,090
If I can't forgive you, Shelley...

1250
01:23:17,890 --> 01:23:19,630
I don't deserve you.

1251
01:23:20,550 --> 01:23:21,800
Understand?

1252
01:23:25,720 --> 01:23:28,180
I want you to call Carol
and patch her through to me.

1253
01:23:28,180 --> 01:23:29,840
Okay? Okay.

1254
01:23:31,130 --> 01:23:32,260
Kim?

1255
01:23:37,720 --> 01:23:39,010
Kim?

1256
01:23:41,430 --> 01:23:44,590
Hi, can you transfer me to
Lynn Johnson office, please?

1257
01:23:46,760 --> 01:23:48,090
Kim?

1258
01:23:50,510 --> 01:23:51,590
Kim?

1259
01:24:08,630 --> 01:24:09,880
Kim?

1260
01:24:15,670 --> 01:24:18,010
Where are you going
in such a hurry, Jack?

1261
01:24:18,010 --> 01:24:21,170
Is there something upstairs
that you don't want me to see?

1262
01:24:21,170 --> 01:24:24,340
There's a woman named Sara
Pollard upstairs very dead.

1263
01:24:24,420 --> 01:24:25,920
You can see her, if you'd like.

1264
01:24:25,920 --> 01:24:28,380
Look, I'm a straight
shooter, right, Jack?

1265
01:24:28,380 --> 01:24:30,300
Yeah. And you'd never
screw me over, right?

1266
01:24:30,300 --> 01:24:31,250
Oh, come on.

1267
01:24:31,250 --> 01:24:34,590
Why are your finger prints
all over Dale Morris apartment?

1268
01:24:35,880 --> 01:24:37,340
They are? Yeah.

1269
01:24:37,500 --> 01:24:40,800
And you were right about the
Halothane on the blood stream.

1270
01:24:40,840 --> 01:24:45,000
What you failed to mention is the fact
that your semen is in her vagina cavity.

1271
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:47,130
Is your semen in Sara Pollard?

1272
01:24:47,170 --> 01:24:49,840
Where the hell are you
going with this, Frank?

1273
01:24:49,840 --> 01:24:51,790
Can't you see this is a frame?

1274
01:24:51,960 --> 01:24:54,920
Forster is coordinating
this whole thing from prison.

1275
01:24:54,960 --> 01:24:56,750
Can't you see that? Yeah, right.

1276
01:24:56,750 --> 01:24:59,960
It is Forster's semen on
Sara Pollard it's yours, Jack?

1277
01:25:00,170 --> 01:25:04,340
Somebody hired Sara Pollard
to be with me last night...

1278
01:25:04,590 --> 01:25:05,960
Then killed her...

1279
01:25:06,330 --> 01:25:10,420
Took my semen and
deposit into Dale Morris.

1280
01:25:10,670 --> 01:25:12,630
Do you have any idea
how absurd that sounds?

1281
01:25:12,630 --> 01:25:13,790
No, it's not absurd.

1282
01:25:13,790 --> 01:25:15,880
I don't have time to explain, Frank.

1283
01:25:15,880 --> 01:25:17,290
Carol isn't answering.

1284
01:25:17,290 --> 01:25:18,380
What? What?

1285
01:25:18,630 --> 01:25:20,210
Carol isn't answering.

1286
01:25:20,920 --> 01:25:24,380
Get the names of all the women
lawyers who work for Forster.

1287
01:25:24,580 --> 01:25:26,040
I want their names and ages.

1288
01:25:26,040 --> 01:25:28,790
Look, I know how you operate,
Jack. What the hell are you doing?

1289
01:25:28,790 --> 01:25:30,540
I know how you use people.

1290
01:25:30,750 --> 01:25:33,830
It's no secret you're a
womanizer, you drink too much.

1291
01:25:33,870 --> 01:25:36,580
How do I know that you haven't
gone completely over the edge?

1292
01:25:36,580 --> 01:25:38,210
Oh, man, I can't believe
it! How do I know?

1293
01:25:38,210 --> 01:25:40,290
I don't know what you do
anymore. What did I do, Frank?

1294
01:25:40,290 --> 01:25:42,210
Did I send myself a tape?

1295
01:25:42,500 --> 01:25:45,580
Did I blow up my car? Did
I set my apartment on fire?

1296
01:25:45,830 --> 01:25:47,580
Did I fire bullets at myself?

1297
01:25:47,580 --> 01:25:49,710
For God sakes, Frank, wake up!

1298
01:25:49,960 --> 01:25:53,790
What the hell... What are you doing?
I have no idea who you're anymore.

1299
01:25:53,910 --> 01:25:55,460
You don't?

1300
01:25:55,660 --> 01:25:58,290
I got Gramm. I'm bringing him
in. No, you're not gonna do this.

1301
01:25:58,290 --> 01:26:01,580
Frank. Frank. Just give me some time.

1302
01:26:01,750 --> 01:26:04,500
Just give me some time.
I can untangle this. Okay?

1303
01:26:04,540 --> 01:26:07,000
Just give me... Here, give me some time.

1304
01:26:07,410 --> 01:26:09,750
Don't move or I'll blow your head off.

1305
01:26:12,660 --> 01:26:14,870
Don't point a gun at me, Frank.

1306
01:26:15,500 --> 01:26:18,540
Don't point a gun at me. Please.

1307
01:26:27,250 --> 01:26:29,870
I wanted to sync up
our watches, that's all.

1308
01:26:38,330 --> 01:26:39,580
All right, Jack.

1309
01:26:40,950 --> 01:26:42,450
What do you need?

1310
01:26:42,830 --> 01:26:45,790
I need time. I need ten minutes. Okay?

1311
01:26:45,950 --> 01:26:47,790
Here, let's sync up now.

1312
01:26:49,780 --> 01:26:52,580
At 11:40, meet me at my
office at the university.

1313
01:27:06,870 --> 01:27:08,240
Kim? What happened?

1314
01:27:08,580 --> 01:27:12,530
I know you're only trying to help me,
but don't go to my office on campus.

1315
01:27:12,530 --> 01:27:15,580
You understand? It's
dangerous. Don't be a hero.

1316
01:27:15,870 --> 01:27:19,200
When you get this message,
call me back A.S.A.P.

1317
01:27:19,280 --> 01:27:20,990
You understand? It's Jack.

1318
01:27:23,620 --> 01:27:24,990
Yeah.

1319
01:27:24,990 --> 01:27:27,490
There's still no answer
at Johnson's office.

1320
01:27:27,490 --> 01:27:29,570
Hold on. Yeah.

1321
01:27:29,820 --> 01:27:30,910
Jack? Kim...

1322
01:27:30,910 --> 01:27:34,280
Whatever you do, don't go to my office
on the campus. Do you understand?

1323
01:27:34,280 --> 01:27:35,780
You have 14 minutes.

1324
01:27:36,910 --> 01:27:37,910
What?

1325
01:27:37,990 --> 01:27:40,070
It was me, Jack. I set you up.

1326
01:27:40,820 --> 01:27:43,070
I had a computer dialing
service call you up...

1327
01:27:43,070 --> 01:27:45,910
Rearranging times, using
electronic altered voice.

1328
01:27:46,110 --> 01:27:48,240
Kim, this is no time to joke.

1329
01:27:48,450 --> 01:27:50,990
Meet me in your office
in ten minutes, Jack.

1330
01:27:50,990 --> 01:27:52,910
11:40. Don't be late.

1331
01:27:53,200 --> 01:27:54,160
Kim!

1332
01:27:55,570 --> 01:27:56,570
Kim!

1333
01:28:32,030 --> 01:28:33,440
Oh, shit.

1334
01:28:38,780 --> 01:28:39,940
Man...

1335
01:28:47,110 --> 01:28:47,860
Yeah.

1336
01:28:47,990 --> 01:28:51,070
Hey, Jack, I got the names of
the women on Forster's legal team.

1337
01:28:51,070 --> 01:28:52,400
They were three.

1338
01:28:52,530 --> 01:28:57,230
Hannah Baker, 53. Rosane
Caputto, 47, and...

1339
01:28:57,400 --> 01:28:58,730
Lydia Doherty, 28.

1340
01:28:58,980 --> 01:29:01,360
And Lydia Doherty, 28. How did you know?

1341
01:29:01,440 --> 01:29:03,780
Cause her name is on the
signature sheet you gave me.

1342
01:29:03,780 --> 01:29:06,030
I want you to do a
search on Lydia Doherty.

1343
01:29:06,030 --> 01:29:08,530
I want you to get all
the information you can.

1344
01:29:08,530 --> 01:29:11,980
Fax it to my office on
campus. Okay? Do it now.

1345
01:29:32,150 --> 01:29:34,570
Hey, another hundred
bucks and I'll wait.

1346
01:30:16,270 --> 01:30:18,480
What the hell are you doing in here?

1347
01:30:19,520 --> 01:30:21,850
This is Lauren Douglas bag.

1348
01:30:22,980 --> 01:30:25,640
It was stolen today. I
found it in your desk.

1349
01:30:27,480 --> 01:30:28,810
Halothane.

1350
01:30:29,600 --> 01:30:31,140
What is it doing here?

1351
01:30:31,440 --> 01:30:32,940
What are you doing in here?

1352
01:30:32,940 --> 01:30:34,980
This is what you used
to kill Dale and Sara?

1353
01:30:34,980 --> 01:30:37,310
Or do you have no idea about this too?

1354
01:30:37,890 --> 01:30:38,930
Oh, sure I do.

1355
01:30:38,930 --> 01:30:42,480
I left all this stuff in my desk
so you'd come along and find it.

1356
01:30:42,600 --> 01:30:44,390
You convinced the jury
that Forster was guilty.

1357
01:30:44,390 --> 01:30:45,980
How do I know you didn't
kill these women too?

1358
01:30:45,980 --> 01:30:47,350
Who sent you here?

1359
01:30:48,430 --> 01:30:50,020
Yeah. I'd like to report a suspect...

1360
01:30:50,020 --> 01:30:51,730
In the Seattle Slayer
case. What the hell...

1361
01:30:51,730 --> 01:30:53,270
Dr. Jack Gramm. Put
down the goddamn phone!

1362
01:30:53,270 --> 01:30:55,350
What's the matter with
you? Who sent you here?

1363
01:30:55,350 --> 01:30:57,100
You think I'm too dumb to
figure it out from myself?

1364
01:30:57,100 --> 01:30:58,140
Yes, I do.

1365
01:30:58,140 --> 01:31:02,390
Because whoever sent you here is
deeply involved in the Slayer killings.

1366
01:31:02,680 --> 01:31:03,810
Lydia Doherty.

1367
01:31:04,220 --> 01:31:06,520
Lydia Doherty. What the hell is that?

1368
01:31:09,930 --> 01:31:10,890
Yeah?

1369
01:31:10,930 --> 01:31:12,600
Come to the Stern Building now.

1370
01:31:12,600 --> 01:31:14,470
Corner office, seventh floor.

1371
01:31:14,930 --> 01:31:16,100
Alone.

1372
01:31:18,600 --> 01:31:20,390
You have five minutes, Jack.

1373
01:31:22,060 --> 01:31:24,180
What are you doing? I'm not moving.

1374
01:31:25,060 --> 01:31:28,140
I don't have time to explain this.

1375
01:31:28,310 --> 01:31:29,560
Get away from the door.

1376
01:31:29,560 --> 01:31:31,510
Come on! You're gonna shoot me?

1377
01:31:36,260 --> 01:31:37,310
Yeah.

1378
01:31:39,560 --> 01:31:41,060
I'm a bad shot.

1379
01:31:43,930 --> 01:31:46,930
Frank, when you get this message
I'm gonna be at the Stern Building...

1380
01:31:46,930 --> 01:31:49,890
On the seventh floor. Get
there as soon as you can.

1381
01:33:48,460 --> 01:33:49,750
Oh, God.

1382
01:33:51,050 --> 01:33:53,000
Punctual, Dr. Gramm.

1383
01:33:54,380 --> 01:33:57,420
I'm gonna give you a B+ for effort.

1384
01:33:57,710 --> 01:34:01,210
Lynn Johnson is indisposed, but I'm
sure she'd say hello, if she could.

1385
01:34:01,210 --> 01:34:04,550
As for your old friend, Kim,
she didn't quite make the grade.

1386
01:34:04,550 --> 01:34:06,250
Lydia. You got the name right.

1387
01:34:06,250 --> 01:34:09,210
Lydia Doherty. Copy cat murderer.

1388
01:34:09,420 --> 01:34:11,790
God, I wish Forster could see your face.

1389
01:34:11,790 --> 01:34:13,670
You look so totally clueless.

1390
01:34:17,750 --> 01:34:20,090
I hope that's not a gun you're holding.

1391
01:34:20,920 --> 01:34:23,130
Is that a gun, Dr. Gramm?

1392
01:34:23,710 --> 01:34:25,090
What do you want?

1393
01:34:25,170 --> 01:34:26,540
Is that a gun?

1394
01:34:27,420 --> 01:34:29,830
I have a gun. Then do this.

1395
01:34:31,330 --> 01:34:32,920
Put it on the floor...

1396
01:34:33,790 --> 01:34:35,500
And slide it to me.

1397
01:34:37,750 --> 01:34:39,080
To me.

1398
01:34:42,670 --> 01:34:43,750
Okay.

1399
01:34:48,500 --> 01:34:49,500
Okay.

1400
01:34:51,420 --> 01:34:52,830
You slide it.

1401
01:35:02,120 --> 01:35:04,370
One more time, slide it to me.

1402
01:35:09,750 --> 01:35:10,830
Slowly.

1403
01:35:12,250 --> 01:35:13,580
And move back.

1404
01:35:20,040 --> 01:35:20,910
Better.

1405
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:46,370
I'd like to talk to
John Forster, please.

1406
01:35:46,370 --> 01:35:48,830
This is his appeal
attorney, Lydia Doherty.

1407
01:35:49,040 --> 01:35:51,080
They monitor his calls.

1408
01:35:52,450 --> 01:35:54,910
You gonna implicate him.
The brilliant Dr. Gramm...

1409
01:35:54,910 --> 01:35:56,990
And his psycho gamble, is that it?

1410
01:35:59,950 --> 01:36:02,410
Sorry for the trouble
I caused, Dr. Gram.

1411
01:36:02,740 --> 01:36:05,290
You know that I did,
Dr. Gramm, with honors.

1412
01:36:05,490 --> 01:36:08,910
Dale told me how good you're
with her when her dad died.

1413
01:36:09,120 --> 01:36:10,530
She was so grateful.

1414
01:36:11,040 --> 01:36:13,330
But despite the fact that
insanity is a legal concept...

1415
01:36:13,330 --> 01:36:15,790
It doesn't mean that
someone is not sick.

1416
01:36:28,620 --> 01:36:30,450
Have him call me on my cell.

1417
01:36:31,330 --> 01:36:32,820
He knows the number.

1418
01:36:34,910 --> 01:36:38,120
What do you want? What about
you start with a confession?

1419
01:36:38,910 --> 01:36:41,370
I confess. To what?

1420
01:36:41,660 --> 01:36:43,490
To what? To everything.

1421
01:36:44,160 --> 01:36:45,780
I confess.

1422
01:36:53,110 --> 01:36:55,870
I want you to speak clearly
and I want the truth.

1423
01:36:55,870 --> 01:36:57,490
Where do I start?

1424
01:36:57,740 --> 01:36:59,860
Janie Kay. Janie Kay?

1425
01:37:00,070 --> 01:37:01,570
I coached her.

1426
01:37:02,660 --> 01:37:03,990
Shut it off.

1427
01:37:05,620 --> 01:37:07,820
Shut it off. I am.

1428
01:37:10,820 --> 01:37:12,030
Go again.

1429
01:37:12,740 --> 01:37:15,360
I coached Janie Kay.

1430
01:37:15,700 --> 01:37:17,950
In what trial? I coached Janie Kay...

1431
01:37:17,950 --> 01:37:22,200
In John Forster's trial. I
coached her. She perjured herself.

1432
01:37:22,610 --> 01:37:24,490
I gave false testimony.

1433
01:37:25,570 --> 01:37:28,240
And John Forster was convicted.

1434
01:37:28,450 --> 01:37:30,610
Based on an unlawful testimony.

1435
01:37:30,740 --> 01:37:32,780
Based on an unlawful testimony.

1436
01:37:36,450 --> 01:37:37,150
Feel good?

1437
01:37:44,280 --> 01:37:45,610
What are you doing?

1438
01:37:45,950 --> 01:37:47,450
Are you assessing me?

1439
01:37:49,570 --> 01:37:52,030
Are you looking for
a weakness, Dr. Gramm?

1440
01:37:52,030 --> 01:37:55,150
I'm just wondering what is next.

1441
01:37:58,190 --> 01:38:00,610
Aren't you gonna offer
to make me a deal?

1442
01:38:01,070 --> 01:38:03,360
Sacrifice yourself for Kim and Carol?

1443
01:38:04,530 --> 01:38:05,820
Be the hero.

1444
01:38:06,280 --> 01:38:10,030
Well, that wouldn't fly out, would
it? I'd offer, but it wouldn't fly.

1445
01:38:10,030 --> 01:38:11,070
Rejected.

1446
01:38:11,860 --> 01:38:13,570
Have any other moves?

1447
01:38:15,110 --> 01:38:17,530
Or you spent so quickly...

1448
01:38:17,690 --> 01:38:22,530
I could move my eyes, like
this, e look behind you.

1449
01:38:23,860 --> 01:38:27,440
To see if there is someone there
with a gun pointed to your head.

1450
01:38:29,360 --> 01:38:32,230
How much time I got left?
You have about a minute.

1451
01:38:33,440 --> 01:38:34,360
Jack.

1452
01:38:34,570 --> 01:38:37,940
Enough time for your last words.
I'm not gonna deny you those.

1453
01:38:38,770 --> 01:38:41,020
All this torture, all this torment...

1454
01:38:42,440 --> 01:38:43,730
For an infatuation?

1455
01:38:43,730 --> 01:38:46,150
It's not an infatuation,
don't demean me.

1456
01:38:46,690 --> 01:38:49,270
Well, if it's not an
infatuation what is it?

1457
01:38:51,400 --> 01:38:52,770
Stop, please!

1458
01:39:09,560 --> 01:39:12,270
I went through great
lengths to pull this off.

1459
01:39:13,690 --> 01:39:16,360
John really appreciates
the quality of my work.

1460
01:39:16,810 --> 01:39:18,230
Timing the phone calls...

1461
01:39:18,230 --> 01:39:21,520
Perfecting the ropes and plus
implicating everyone close to you.

1462
01:39:21,520 --> 01:39:23,440
Coaching Carol and Kim.

1463
01:39:24,440 --> 01:39:26,350
All the while staying invisible.

1464
01:39:26,350 --> 01:39:28,270
It was me, Jack. I set you up.

1465
01:39:28,350 --> 01:39:30,350
You know what I don't understand?

1466
01:39:30,350 --> 01:39:34,600
How, in God's name, does
anybody give up their free will?

1467
01:39:35,100 --> 01:39:36,400
How you do that?

1468
01:39:36,480 --> 01:39:38,600
45 seconds. I saw you.

1469
01:39:38,690 --> 01:39:41,560
You came to my class, I remember you.

1470
01:39:41,770 --> 01:39:44,350
You were intelligent. An individual.

1471
01:39:44,600 --> 01:39:45,980
You challenged things.

1472
01:39:45,980 --> 01:39:48,520
You challenged me. You challenged ideas.

1473
01:39:48,980 --> 01:39:50,640
You're your own person.

1474
01:39:50,850 --> 01:39:55,770
How could you ever allowed yourself
to be so manipulated by this guy?

1475
01:39:56,020 --> 01:39:57,060
30 seconds.

1476
01:39:57,060 --> 01:39:58,770
You're gonna take the fall for this guy?

1477
01:39:58,770 --> 01:40:01,350
If that's what he wants, so be it.

1478
01:40:01,810 --> 01:40:03,520
You see, Jacko...

1479
01:40:04,060 --> 01:40:05,350
I'm a true believer.

1480
01:40:05,350 --> 01:40:07,730
You better believe
that's an FBI agent...

1481
01:40:07,730 --> 01:40:10,100
With a gun pointed
right into your head...

1482
01:40:10,100 --> 01:40:11,270
At this moment.

1483
01:40:12,020 --> 01:40:13,060
Believe it.

1484
01:40:13,230 --> 01:40:15,640
No more kidding. Believe it.

1485
01:40:17,060 --> 01:40:18,930
Believe it. I believe your time is up...

1486
01:40:18,930 --> 01:40:20,390
Dr. Gramm.

1487
01:40:35,100 --> 01:40:36,430
God.

1488
01:40:38,100 --> 01:40:39,350
Jack!

1489
01:40:41,470 --> 01:40:42,850
Jack!

1490
01:40:42,890 --> 01:40:43,890
No!

1491
01:40:47,470 --> 01:40:48,560
Jack!

1492
01:40:48,930 --> 01:40:50,140
Jack!

1493
01:40:56,720 --> 01:40:57,930
No!

1494
01:40:58,140 --> 01:40:59,180
Jack!

1495
01:40:59,470 --> 01:41:00,600
No!

1496
01:41:01,010 --> 01:41:02,060
Jack!

1497
01:41:02,970 --> 01:41:04,140
No!

1498
01:41:07,550 --> 01:41:08,680
No!

1499
01:41:45,180 --> 01:41:46,300
Again!

1500
01:41:56,470 --> 01:41:58,430
I got you. I got you.

1501
01:41:58,840 --> 01:41:59,930
It's okay.

1502
01:41:59,970 --> 01:42:01,550
It's okay, sweetheart.

1503
01:42:04,340 --> 01:42:06,380
Requesting immediately MT help.

1504
01:42:06,630 --> 01:42:09,680
At the UNW Campus, Stern Building.

1505
01:42:10,130 --> 01:42:11,340
I repeat.

1506
01:42:11,510 --> 01:42:14,550
Immediately emergency
medical technician.

1507
01:42:15,090 --> 01:42:17,010
Multiple stab wounds.

1508
01:42:20,170 --> 01:42:21,340
There you go.

1509
01:42:23,010 --> 01:42:25,260
That's okay. Don't move.

1510
01:42:42,170 --> 01:42:42,880
Yeah.

1511
01:42:42,880 --> 01:42:46,090
This is officer Finnegan from the
State Penitentiary Walla Walla.

1512
01:42:46,090 --> 01:42:49,170
I'm placing a call from John Forster
to his attorney Lydia Doherty.

1513
01:42:49,170 --> 01:42:50,460
Put him through.

1514
01:42:51,420 --> 01:42:52,760
Go ahead.

1515
01:42:52,800 --> 01:42:53,920
Lydia.

1516
01:42:55,210 --> 01:42:56,800
Did you finish with Gramm?

1517
01:42:56,800 --> 01:42:59,210
She's downstairs. Gramm?

1518
01:43:02,460 --> 01:43:04,000
Put my attorney on the phone, please.

1519
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:05,340
She's indisposed.

1520
01:43:05,340 --> 01:43:07,460
Look, you're meddling her.
You shouldn't be meddling in.

1521
01:43:07,460 --> 01:43:12,130
You seized a naive junior
lawyer on your legal staff.

1522
01:43:12,750 --> 01:43:15,630
You realized that she's
damaged psychologically and...

1523
01:43:15,630 --> 01:43:16,670
Genius, isn't it?

1524
01:43:16,670 --> 01:43:19,170
Susceptible to your
craps. And what you do?

1525
01:43:19,340 --> 01:43:21,090
You get her to kill people for you.

1526
01:43:21,090 --> 01:43:22,630
So you can stay alive.

1527
01:43:22,800 --> 01:43:25,750
That's an innovative legal strategy,
if I have ever heard of any.

1528
01:43:25,750 --> 01:43:28,590
Dr. Gramm, I'm flattered
with your imagination.

1529
01:43:29,250 --> 01:43:30,540
But you're grasping in straw.

1530
01:43:30,540 --> 01:43:33,210
She becomes a student
of mine, no less...

1531
01:43:33,590 --> 01:43:36,840
You keep her on the appeal process,
but she's still your lawyer...

1532
01:43:36,840 --> 01:43:39,250
So she has unlimited access to you...

1533
01:43:39,460 --> 01:43:42,670
So you can plan your
copy cat murders together.

1534
01:43:42,920 --> 01:43:45,040
And then you can get a new trial.

1535
01:43:45,170 --> 01:43:47,920
And live happily ever
after. Isn't that the case?

1536
01:43:47,920 --> 01:43:51,130
Dr. Gramm, I want you
to listen very closely...

1537
01:43:51,960 --> 01:43:54,000
Because when I get out of here...

1538
01:43:54,580 --> 01:43:57,000
I'm gonna go out and have a nice meal...

1539
01:43:57,210 --> 01:43:58,920
Stop by your grave...

1540
01:43:59,750 --> 01:44:01,540
And piss all over it.

1541
01:44:02,920 --> 01:44:05,710
Now, please, put my angelical
attorney on the phone.

1542
01:44:05,710 --> 01:44:06,750
She's dead.

1543
01:44:07,620 --> 01:44:09,370
It's over, Forster.

1544
01:44:09,620 --> 01:44:11,750
Except for the clock,
that goes tic-Tac.

1545
01:44:11,750 --> 01:44:14,500
Tic-Tac. You got 12 hours to live.

1546
01:44:33,460 --> 01:44:36,330
I'm glad, that my sister Jony
hasn't been forgotten.

1547
01:44:37,160 --> 01:44:38,500
We did good, Jane,

1548
01:44:38,660 --> 01:44:39,750
we did good.

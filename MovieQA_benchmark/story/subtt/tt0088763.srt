What? What, Ma?

1547
01:44:06,887 --> 01:44:10,721
Aren't you going up to the lake?
You've been planning it for two weeks.

1548
01:44:10,927 --> 01:44:13,361
We talked about this.
How can I go to the lake?

1549
01:44:13,567 --> 01:44:14,636
The car's wrecked.

1550
01:44:14,727 --> 01:44:16,160
MR. MCFLY: Wrecked?
DAVID: Wrecked?

1551
01:44:16,327 --> 01:44:18,443
When did this happen? Why wasn't I told?

1552
01:44:18,527 --> 01:44:21,963
MR. MCFLY: I'm sure the car is fine.
DAVID: Why am I the last to know?

1553
01:44:22,287 --> 01:44:25,006
MR. MCFLY: See? There's Biff out there
waxing it now.

1554
01:44:25,647 --> 01:44:29,799
Now, Biff, I want to make sure we get
two coats of wax, not just one.

1555
01:44:29,887 --> 01:44:33,846
- I'm just finishing up the second coat now.
- Now, Biff, don't con me.

1556
01:44:35,447 --> 01:44:37,278
I'm sorry, Mr. McFly.

1557
01:44:37,447 --> 01:44:40,200
I meant I was just starting
on the second coat.

1558
01:44:40,927 --> 01:44:43,043
Biff. What a character.

1559
01:44:43,207 --> 01:44:45,516
<i>Always trying to get away with something.</i>

1560
01:44:45,607 --> 01:44:48,485

<i>ever since high school.</i>

1561
01:44:48,567 --> 01:44:52,480
MR. MCFLY: But, if it wasn't for him...
MRS. MCFLY: We'd never have fallen in love.

1562
01:44:54,167 --> 01:44:56,635
Mr. McFly! Mr. McFly, this just arrived.

1563
01:44:56,807 --> 01:44:59,367
Hi, Marty. I think it's your new book.

1564
01:45:02,007 --> 01:45:04,282
Honey! Your first novel.

1565
01:45:05,727 --> 01:45:10,596
MR. MCFLY: I've always told you, if you put your
mind to it, you can accomplish anything.

1566
01:45:10,767 --> 01:45:14,237
Marty, here's your keys.
You're all waxed up, ready for tonight.

1567
01:45:14,487 --> 01:45:15,397
Keys?

1568
01:45:26,847 --> 01:45:28,883
[Tender instrumental music]

1569
01:45:31,247 --> 01:45:33,602
- How about a ride, mister?
- Jennifer!

1570
01:45:35,207 --> 01:45:37,084
Are you a sight for sore eyes.

1571
01:45:37,447 --> 01:45:39,085
MARTY: Let me look at you.

1572
01:45:39,567 --> 01:45:42,320
Marty, you're acting like
you haven't seen me in a week.

1573
01:45:42,407 --> 01:45:43,476
I haven't.

1574
01:45:44,327 --> 01:45:45,396
You okay?

1575
01:45:46,247 --> 01:45:47,999
Is everything all right?

1576
01:45:50,607 --> 01:45:51,642
MARTY: Yeah.

1577
01:45:53,807 --> 01:45:55,399
Everything is great.

1578
01:45:58,247 --> 01:45:59,919

[Brakes screeching]

1580
01:46:09,207 --> 01:46:10,117
Marty!

1581
01:46:11,447 --> 01:46:13,438
You've got to come back with me!

1582
01:46:14,047 --> 01:46:16,197
- Where?
- Back to the future.

1583
01:46:20,807 --> 01:46:22,559
What are you doing, Doc?

1584
01:46:23,847 --> 01:46:24,996
I need fuel.

1585
01:46:28,167 --> 01:46:30,237
Go ahead. Quick! Get in the car.

1586
01:46:30,567 --> 01:46:34,845
No, no. I just got here. Jennifer's here.
We're taking the new truck for a spin.

1587
01:46:34,927 --> 01:46:37,680
DOC: Bring her along. This concerns her, too.

1588
01:46:37,807 --> 01:46:41,163
What are you talking about?
What happens to us in the future?

1589
01:46:41,447 --> 01:46:44,280
- Do we become assholes or something?
- No, Marty.

1590
01:46:44,367 --> 01:46:47,564
Both you and Jennifer turn out fine.
It's your kids, Marty.

1591
01:46:47,647 --> 01:46:49,797
Something has got to be done
about your kids.

1592
01:46:55,927 --> 01:46:58,839
We better back up.
We don't have enough road to get up to 88.

1593
01:46:58,927 --> 01:47:02,397
Roads? Where we're going,
we don't need roads.

1594

00:01:47,634 --> 00:01:50,569
Hey, can I get another drink
down here?

2
00:01:50,637 --> 00:01:52,730
WILLIE:
I've been to prison once.

3
00:01:52,806 --> 00:01:55,331
I've been married twice.

4
00:01:55,409 --> 00:01:57,673
I was once drafted by
Lyndon Johnson and had to live

5
00:01:57,744 --> 00:02:01,840
in shit-ass Mexico for two
and a half years for no reason.

6
00:02:01,915 --> 00:02:05,510
I've had my eye socket
punched in, a kidney taken out,

7
00:02:05,585 --> 00:02:09,146
and I got a bone chip in my
ankle that's never gonna heal.

8
00:02:09,856 --> 00:02:13,053
I've seen some pretty shitty
situations in my life.

9
00:02:13,126 --> 00:02:16,459
But nothing has ever sucked
more ass than this.

10
00:02:17,364 --> 00:02:20,026
If I'd known I was gonna have to
put up with screaming brats

11
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:22,068
pissing on my lap for 30 days
out of the year,

12
00:02:22,135 --> 00:02:25,764
I would have killed myself
a long time ago.

13
00:02:28,308 --> 00:02:31,766
Come to think of it,
I still might.

14
00:02:33,146 --> 00:02:35,740
Where I come from,
we didn't celebrate Christmas.

15
00:02:35,816 --> 00:02:37,977
Not because we were Jewish,
but because my dad

16
00:02:38,051 --> 00:02:40,952
was a worthless-coward fucking
asshole whose idea of a present

17
00:02:41,021 --> 00:02:43,683
was a daily punch
to the back of the head.

18
00:02:43,757 --> 00:02:46,351
He did teach me
how to crack a safe, though.

19
00:02:47,761 --> 00:02:51,197
My dad never did shit with his
life, so he took it out on me.

20
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:54,324
You could say I'm no different.
I'd have to say you were right.

21
00:02:54,401 --> 00:02:56,995
But at this point,
it's too late to start over.

22
00:02:57,070 --> 00:02:59,061
Funny how things work out.

23
00:02:59,139 --> 00:03:01,437
It's fucking hilarious.

Wow.

27

Oh, my.
What a darling photo.

28
00:03:38,078 --> 00:03:39,978
Are you certain you only want
the single?

29
00:03:40,047 --> 00:03:43,244
Additional photos come in handy
as gifts for Grandma and Grandpa

30
00:03:43,316 --> 00:03:45,682
or as a wonderful remembrance
for friends.

31
00:03:45,752 --> 00:03:46,776
Gee.
You know what?

32
00:03:46,853 --> 00:03:48,821
This one, I think it's more
than enough.

33
00:03:48,889 --> 00:03:51,722
Thanks.
Merry Christmas.

34
00:03:52,325 --> 00:03:54,259
So, what do you want,
little girl?

35
00:03:54,327 --> 00:03:56,124
A drum set.

36
00:03:56,196 --> 00:03:58,061
Oh, the old man will love that.

37
00:03:58,131 --> 00:04:00,361
Okay. Fine.
See you later.

38

Well, I'm very happy for you.

40
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:15,411
You're not really Santa.

41
00:04:15,482 --> 00:04:17,780
If you were Santa,
you could do magic.

42
00:04:17,851 --> 00:04:19,876
You want to see some magic?

43
00:04:19,953 --> 00:04:22,285
Here.
Let's watch you disappear.

44
00:04:23,023 --> 00:04:25,423
Watch the bladder, kid.
Santa's got to pee.

45
00:04:25,492 --> 00:04:27,483
- What do you want?
- A new bike.

46
00:04:27,561 --> 00:04:29,529

00:16:14,534 --> 00:16:15,933
I called State Farm,

181
00:16:16,002 --> 00:16:19,403
but they have no record
of any insurance policy for you.

182
00:16:19,472 --> 00:16:22,100
In case you misplaced it,
my phone number is 4...

183
00:16:22,175 --> 00:16:24,075
[Beep]
Message three.

184
00:16:24,143 --> 00:16:27,476
Willie, it's Marcus.
It's that time of year again.

185
00:16:27,547 --> 00:16:30,710
Pack your shit.
Phoenix.

186
00:16:30,817 --> 00:16:34,344
<i>Oh, the weather outside</i>
<i>is frightful</i>

187
00:16:34,387 --> 00:16:37,914
<i>But the fire</i>
<i>is so delightful</i>

188
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:41,391
<i>And since we've no place</i>
<i>to go</i>

189
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:44,793
<i>Let it snow, let it snow,</i>
<i>let it snow</i>

190
00:16:44,864 --> 00:16:48,527
<i>Man, it doesn't show signs</i>
<i>of stopping</i>

191
00:16:48,601 --> 00:16:52,503
<i>And I brought me some corn</i>
<i>for popping</i>

192
00:16:52,572 --> 00:16:55,700
<i>The lights are turned</i>
<i>way down low</i>

193
00:16:55,775 --> 00:17:01,941
<i>Let it snow, let it snow</i>

194
00:17:04,383 --> 00:17:06,544
[Car alarm blaring]

195
00:17:06,619 --> 00:17:08,143
Jesus Christ!

196
00:17:08,221 --> 00:17:11,520
Can you maybe keep it together
for just 10 minutes?

197
00:17:18,130 --> 00:17:21,122
Harrison, just let me explain,
please. Financially...

198
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,134
Well, you get what you paid for,
Chipeska.

199
00:17:23,202 --> 00:17:24,897
Five Christmases I've been here.

200
00:17:24,971 --> 00:17:27,064
You flip me for some stranger
who'll do it for peanuts

201
00:17:27,139 --> 00:17:29,664
and who happens to work
with a real midget.

202
00:17:29,742 --> 00:17:31,937
Nobody cares.
Nobody comes here for the elf.

203
00:17:32,011 --> 00:17:33,342
Santa's the attraction.

204
00:17:33,412 --> 00:17:34,879
I do Burl Ives songs.

205
00:17:34,947 --> 00:17:36,710
Does this schmo
even play guitar?

206
00:17:36,782 --> 00:17:40,240
Look, Harrison, it's not about
the money or the midget.

207
00:17:40,319 --> 00:17:42,082
Believe me, if it was, I...

208
00:17:42,154 --> 00:17:43,849
I don't think they like
"midget."

209
00:17:43,923 --> 00:17:45,686
I think you're supposed to
call them...

210
00:17:45,758 --> 00:17:48,192
Oh, just forget it.

211
00:17:49,495 --> 00:17:51,224
Hacks!

212
00:17:51,764 --> 00:17:52,628
Hi.

213
00:17:52,698 --> 00:17:55,098
Bob Chipeska.
Welcome.

214
00:17:55,167 --> 00:17:57,158
Great photo and résumé,
by the way.

215
00:17:57,236 --> 00:17:57,998
Thanks.

216
00:17:58,070 --> 00:18:00,163
We've been at this
a long time and all.

217
00:18:00,239 --> 00:18:02,002
We'd like to think we do
a good job.

218
00:18:02,074 --> 00:18:04,668
I'm so glad you guys could
come in on such short notice.

219
00:18:04,744 --> 00:18:07,304
[Voices fading] I must say,
your look is just sensational.

220
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:08,039
MARCUS:
Thanks.

221
00:18:08,114 --> 00:18:10,947
We've been at this for years.
You got nothing to worry about.

222
00:18:11,017 --> 00:18:13,884
You two are the best men
for this job, truly.

223
00:18:13,953 --> 00:18:17,286
So don't let his unpleasantness
affect your performance.

224
00:18:17,356 --> 00:18:19,324
- Oh, no. We're fine.
- Performance?

225
00:18:19,392 --> 00:18:22,293
Yes. Uh, your performance.
You know, the, um...

226
00:18:22,361 --> 00:18:24,556
Performance, like sexual?

227
00:18:25,731 --> 00:18:26,891
- Excuse me?
- Willie.

228
00:18:26,966 --> 00:18:29,298
Are you saying there's
something wrong with my gear?

229
00:18:29,368 --> 00:18:30,665
Is that what you're saying?

230
00:18:30,736 --> 00:18:32,203
- I'm sorry. Your gear?
- Willie.

231
00:18:32,271 --> 00:18:34,068
My fuck stick.

232
00:18:35,775 --> 00:18:37,606
Hey, Willie.
Take a seat.

233
00:18:37,677 --> 00:18:39,144
You know how
your blood sugar is.

234
00:18:39,211 --> 00:18:42,669
He's not going to say "fuck
stick" in front of the children?

235
00:18:42,748 --> 00:18:44,682
No, no, no.
It's a joke.

236
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:48,083
An adult joke for us adults.

237
00:18:48,154 --> 00:18:49,917
It's a joke.
Just a joke.

238
00:18:56,629 --> 00:18:57,596
"Fuck stick"?

239
00:18:57,663 --> 00:19:00,598
Yes. I thought it was
very strange, too.

240
00:19:00,666 --> 00:19:03,157
So, as our security chief,

241
00:19:03,235 --> 00:19:05,362
I wanted you to be aware.

242
00:19:05,438 --> 00:19:07,702
But his little friend promised
he wouldn't say it

243
00:19:07,773 --> 00:19:09,764
in front of the children,
which is fine.

244
00:19:09,842 --> 00:19:13,300
Because, you know,
there is an adult world

245
00:19:13,379 --> 00:19:15,847
and a child's world,
and that's okay.

246
00:19:15,915 --> 00:19:17,678
I'm no censor.

247
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:18,512
"Little friend"?

248
00:19:18,584 --> 00:19:21,519
Yes, he happens to be a dwarf.

249
00:19:21,587 --> 00:19:24,215
Or midget.

250
00:19:24,290 --> 00:19:26,656
I don't know
what he's called exactly.

251
00:19:26,726 --> 00:19:30,127
But, uh, he's a little guy.

252
00:19:30,196 --> 00:19:33,063
Little Billy Barty.
God rest.

253
00:19:33,132 --> 00:19:34,258
But thin fingers.

254
00:19:34,333 --> 00:19:38,827
Not the fat sausage fingers.

255
00:19:40,873 --> 00:19:42,807
"Little people."
That's what they like.

256
00:19:42,875 --> 00:19:46,367
Yes. Uh, right.
Little people.

257
00:19:46,445 --> 00:19:48,436
So "fuck stick."
That's it?

258
00:19:49,382 --> 00:19:51,247
Yeah.
[Clears throat]

259
00:19:56,288 --> 00:19:59,052
Merry Christmas!
Santa's coming. Yay!

260
00:19:59,125 --> 00:20:02,288
Merry Christmas!
Santa's coming. Yay!

261
00:20:02,361 --> 00:20:04,852
Merry Christmas!

262
00:20:09,969 --> 00:20:12,301
Have you seen that new Santa
they just hired?

263
00:20:12,371 --> 00:20:14,839
Yeah.
He's back there drunk.

264
00:20:18,878 --> 00:20:22,678
He's coming, guys.
Santa will be here real soon.

265
00:20:23,315 --> 00:20:25,977
[Snoring]

266
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,085
God damn it!

267
00:20:29,155 --> 00:20:32,181
What the fuck you doing?
You blow this, and we're broke.

268
00:20:32,258 --> 00:20:33,885
So stop acting
like you know something.

269
00:20:33,959 --> 00:20:35,654
'Cause, pal of mine,
you don't know squat!

270
00:20:35,728 --> 00:20:37,628
Now, put on your hat
and get out there.

271
00:20:37,696 --> 00:20:40,824
And try to act professional,
for Christ's sakes.

272
00:20:46,439 --> 00:20:48,168
WILLIE:
What do you want?

273
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,764
What?

274
00:20:49,842 --> 00:20:51,400
Get out of here.

275
00:20:51,477 --> 00:20:53,206
Next.

276
00:20:54,046 --> 00:20:55,877
Next.

277
00:20:55,948 --> 00:20:58,382
Oh, good.
What do you want?

278
00:20:59,752 --> 00:21:01,652
What do you want?
What are you doing?

279
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,779
[Sneezes]

280
00:21:03,856 --> 00:21:04,845
God damn it!

281
00:21:04,924 --> 00:21:07,085
Nintendo Deer Hunter 3.

282
00:21:07,159 --> 00:21:09,127
I don't give a shit
what you want.

283
00:21:09,195 --> 00:21:11,857
Blowing snot all over everybody
and fucking whatever.

284
00:21:11,931 --> 00:21:13,956
Next.
Come on.

285
00:21:15,901 --> 00:21:17,459
What do you want?

286
00:21:17,536 --> 00:21:19,800
- Um, Santa?
- Yeah, I'm Santa.

287
00:21:19,872 --> 00:21:21,066
Come on.
What do you want?

288
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:23,301
- Um, Barbie.
- Say cheese.

289
00:21:23,375 --> 00:21:24,569
Okay. Fine.
Barbie.

290
00:21:24,643 --> 00:21:25,905
Oh, thank you.

291
00:21:25,978 --> 00:21:28,947
Ow! Watch the toenails, kid!
Shit.

292
00:21:29,014 --> 00:21:30,311
Next.

293
00:21:31,417 --> 00:21:33,351
Next!

294
00:21:35,788 --> 00:21:36,880
What do you want?

295
00:21:36,956 --> 00:21:39,481
Fraggle-Stick car.

296
00:21:39,558 --> 00:21:41,549
What the fuck is that?

297
00:21:41,627 --> 00:21:43,185
Fraggle-Stick car.

298
00:21:43,262 --> 00:21:46,231
Well, I heard you.
Fraggle-Stick car. Fine.

299
00:22:01,013 --> 00:22:03,106
Hey, check out this loser.

300
00:22:03,682 --> 00:22:06,048
Hey, fat-ass.
How you doing today?

301
00:22:08,154 --> 00:22:09,712
Hey, loser.

302
00:22:09,788 --> 00:22:11,619
Hey, dipshit.

303
00:22:11,690 --> 00:22:13,248
Moron.

304
00:22:13,792 --> 00:22:16,192
Hey, loser.
How you doing today?

305
00:22:16,996 --> 00:22:19,328
Dumb-ass,
why don't you turn around?

306
00:22:22,468 --> 00:22:24,936
You know what?
Fuck this.

307
00:22:29,642 --> 00:22:31,200
You're next.

308
00:22:31,277 --> 00:22:33,268
WILLIE:
Next.

309
00:22:33,345 --> 00:22:36,712
I said next, God damn it.
This is not the DMV, all right?

310
00:22:36,782 --> 00:22:38,477
Move it along.

311
00:22:40,519 --> 00:22:42,919
What's your name?
You can tell me.

312
00:22:45,024 --> 00:22:47,288
I know.
How about Santa?

313
00:22:47,359 --> 00:22:49,919
If you don't tell him,
you won't get a present.

314
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:52,054
That's right.

315
00:22:52,131 --> 00:22:55,100
Come on and tell Santa
all about it.

316
00:22:58,737 --> 00:22:59,726
What do you want?

317
00:23:01,974 --> 00:23:03,566
Well, come on.
What do you want?

318
00:23:03,642 --> 00:23:05,507
A snot-rag?

319
00:23:08,514 --> 00:23:10,675
Great.
Another fucking Mongoloid.

320
00:23:10,749 --> 00:23:14,082
Marcus, get this kid off me
before he pisses on me.

321
00:23:14,153 --> 00:23:15,814
Don't fuck with my beard.

322
00:23:15,888 --> 00:23:17,355
It's not real.

323
00:23:17,423 --> 00:23:18,913
No shit.

324
00:23:18,991 --> 00:23:20,219
Well, it was real.

325
00:23:20,292 --> 00:23:23,625
But, you see, I got sick
and all the hair fell out.

326
00:23:23,696 --> 00:23:25,630
How did you get sick?

327
00:23:26,232 --> 00:23:28,166
I loved a woman
who wasn't clean.

328
00:23:28,234 --> 00:23:29,326
Mrs. Santa?

329
00:23:29,401 --> 00:23:30,629
No.
It was her sister.

330
00:23:30,703 --> 00:23:32,830
What's it like
at the North Pole?

331
00:23:32,905 --> 00:23:34,270
Like the suburbs.

332
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:35,830
Which one?

333
00:23:36,742 --> 00:23:38,039
Apache Junction.

334
00:23:38,110 --> 00:23:40,874
What the fuck do you care?
Now, get off my lap.

335
00:23:40,946 --> 00:23:42,937
You sit there
like a fucking retard.

336
00:23:43,015 --> 00:23:44,983
You are really Santa, right?

337
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:46,381
No.
I'm an accountant.

338
00:23:46,452 --> 00:23:49,910
I wear this fucking thing as
a fashion statement, all right?

339
00:23:49,989 --> 00:23:51,718
Okay.

340
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:54,315
Get this kid out of here.
He's freaking me out.

341
00:24:00,099 --> 00:24:03,432
I got to get a drink on.
I'll see you tomorrow.

342
00:24:03,502 --> 00:24:06,198
Just don't come into work
stinking of booze again.

343
00:24:06,272 --> 00:24:07,739
Yeah.
Why don't you get going?

344
00:24:07,806 --> 00:24:10,798
You'll be late for your
"Wizard of Oz" Candy Bar Guild.

345
00:24:10,876 --> 00:24:13,276
Lollipop Guild, you asshole.
Jesus!

346
00:24:13,345 --> 00:24:15,745
Two-year-olds flip me shit
better than you.

347
00:24:15,814 --> 00:24:16,906
You saying something to me?

348
00:24:16,982 --> 00:24:20,315
Yeah. I'm gonna stick
my whole fist up your ass.

349
00:24:28,594 --> 00:24:31,188

350
00:24:31,263 --> 00:24:33,424

So, what do you do, you know...

371
00:25:30,055 --> 00:25:31,488
After the holidays, I mean.

372
00:25:31,557 --> 00:25:34,492
Well, nothing till March,
and then I'm the Easter Bunny.

373
00:25:39,331 --> 00:25:40,491

Merry Christmas.

00:25:51,176 --> 00:25:53,269
Not a big talker.

377
00:25:53,345 --> 00:25:54,903
No, not really.

378

- Buy you one?
- Why not?

Happy New Year.

380
00:26:09,895 --> 00:26:12,386
You're pretty regular
for a Santa.

381
00:26:12,464 --> 00:26:14,125
It's not that big
a fucking deal.

382
00:26:14,199 --> 00:26:16,394
It's just a job,
you know what I mean?

383
00:26:16,468 --> 00:26:20,837
I'm an eating, drinking,
shitting, fucking Santy Claus.

384

Can't I at least take
this hat off?

389
00:26:34,486 --> 00:26:36,181
[Laughing]
No. I love the hat.

390
00:26:36,255 --> 00:26:38,052
[Moans]
Okay.

Whoo!
[Breathing heavily]

392
00:26:45,397 --> 00:26:49,629
I've always had a thing
for Santa Claus.

393
00:26:49,701 --> 00:26:51,328
In case you didn't notice.

394
00:26:51,403 --> 00:26:54,395
It's like some deep-seated
childhood thing.

395
00:26:54,473 --> 00:26:56,407
So is my thing for tits.

396
00:26:56,475 --> 00:26:58,739
Yeah.
It is like that, though.

397
00:26:58,811 --> 00:27:00,005
From when you're a kid.

398
00:27:00,078 --> 00:27:02,410
'Cause my dad was Jewish,
and we didn't have Christmas.

399
00:27:02,481 --> 00:27:06,975
So it was like
this forbidden thing.

400
00:27:07,052 --> 00:27:09,987
[Laughs, clears throat]

401
00:27:10,055 --> 00:27:11,716
So...

402
00:27:14,426 --> 00:27:15,723
I like you.

403
00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:20,128
Don't mothball that suit.

404
00:27:26,872 --> 00:27:27,804
What the fuck?

405
00:27:27,873 --> 00:27:29,864
I am not gay.

406
00:27:30,843 --> 00:27:32,868
- What the hell, buddy?
- Buddy?

407
00:27:32,945 --> 00:27:34,845
I said I am not gay.

408
00:27:34,913 --> 00:27:38,041
Are you off your fucking meds
or something?

409
00:27:38,116 --> 00:27:39,583
Yes.

410
00:27:39,651 --> 00:27:42,313
But that isn't
what this is about.

411
00:27:42,387 --> 00:27:44,082
You're as queer as a $ 10 bill.

412
00:27:44,156 --> 00:27:46,488
Let me tell you something,
motherfucker.

413
00:27:46,558 --> 00:27:50,255
My brother lost a goddamn arm
fighting you fuckers in Vietnam.

414
00:27:50,329 --> 00:27:53,526
So I want you to look at my face
one last fucking time.

415
00:27:53,599 --> 00:27:56,227
This is the last thing you're
ever gonna see before I...

417
00:27:57,336 --> 00:27:59,429
- Motherfucker!
- Turn around, elf fucker.

00:27:59,505 --> 00:28:01,973
Who's the bitch now,
Santy Claus? Huh?

419

Faggy Claus!
Faggy!

420

Leave Santa alone!

421
00:28:05,177 --> 00:28:08,476
Little boy, don't interfere.
I am doing this for all of us.

422
00:28:08,547 --> 00:28:10,310
Leave Santa alone!

Hey, you're that kid.

426

What the fuck are you
doing here?

427
00:28:42,748 --> 00:28:45,012
This one fucking time
I take you home, okay?

428
00:28:45,083 --> 00:28:46,072
Uh-huh.

429
00:28:46,151 --> 00:28:47,584
I'm not your fucking dada.

430
00:28:47,653 --> 00:28:49,348
Uh-huh.

431
00:28:51,023 --> 00:28:53,958
It's not like you helped me
with that nutjob or anything.

432
00:28:54,026 --> 00:28:55,687
- Uh-huh.
- You're the right height.

433
00:28:55,761 --> 00:28:58,355
You're right there
to grab his balls.

434
00:28:58,430 --> 00:29:00,625
- You could twist them.
- Why do you need a car?

435
00:29:00,699 --> 00:29:03,759
- What?
- This car.

436
00:29:03,835 --> 00:29:04,767

Sage Terrace.
Where's your sleigh?

438
00:29:07,005 --> 00:29:09,166
It's in the shop,
getting repaired.

439
00:29:09,241 --> 00:29:11,675
- Where are the reindeer?
- I stabled them.

440
00:29:11,743 --> 00:29:13,005
Is it left or right?

441
00:29:13,078 --> 00:29:14,102
That way.

442
00:29:14,179 --> 00:29:15,806
Where's the stable?

443
00:29:15,881 --> 00:29:18,042
- Next to the shop.
- How do they sleep?

444
00:29:18,116 --> 00:29:20,209
Who? The reindeer?
Standing up.

445
00:29:20,285 --> 00:29:21,752
But the noise.
How do they sleep?

446
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:23,811
- What noise?
- From the shop.

447
00:29:25,257 --> 00:29:27,350
They only work during the day,
all right?

448
00:29:27,426 --> 00:29:29,189
I thought it was always night
at the North Pole.

449

Well, not now.
Right now it's always day.

450
00:29:31,263 --> 00:29:32,457

- Oh, shit. Sage Terrace.

On <i>my</i> head?

454
00:29:39,905 --> 00:29:42,169
Are they gonna drop you
on somebody else's head?

455
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,901
How can they drop me
onto my own head?

456
00:29:43,976 --> 00:29:46,740
No, not <i>onto</i> your...
Would...

460

With Jesus and his family
there or what?

No.
The one beside that.

462

- Right here?
- Yeah. That one.

463

He's on an adventure,
exploring mountains.

467
00:30:19,211 --> 00:30:20,644
He's been gone a long time.

468
00:30:20,712 --> 00:30:24,443
Exploring mountains, huh?
How long is he gonna be gone?

469
00:30:24,516 --> 00:30:25,448
Till next year.

What about Mommy?

She lives in God's house with
Jesus and Mary and the ghost

472

and the long-eared donkey and
Joseph and the talking walnut.

of you, then?

00:33:10,749 --> 00:33:13,217
Look, I've boned a lot
of fat chicks in my time, sure.

532
00:33:13,285 --> 00:33:18,416
But as far as I can recall,
I've never fornicated anybody.

533
00:33:18,490 --> 00:33:19,684
Yes, well, even still,

534
00:33:19,758 --> 00:33:22,693
I think it's best for
all parties considered if we...

535
00:33:22,761 --> 00:33:24,422
If we what?

536
00:33:24,996 --> 00:33:28,090
Well, I have someone else
interested in the position.

537
00:33:29,034 --> 00:33:30,558
Before you do something stupid,

538
00:33:30,635 --> 00:33:32,193
you may want to think
about this shit.

539
00:33:32,270 --> 00:33:33,430
What are you talking about?

540
00:33:33,505 --> 00:33:36,099
I'm talking about firing
a little black midget.

541
00:33:36,174 --> 00:33:38,734
A colored, African-American
small person.

542
00:33:38,810 --> 00:33:40,038
That's what I'm talking about.

543
00:33:40,111 --> 00:33:44,207
I'm talking about your face
all over goddamn "USA Today."

544
00:33:44,282 --> 00:33:46,682
I'm talking about 150
of these little motherfuckers

545
00:33:46,751 --> 00:33:48,878
all over the sidewalk out there.

546
00:33:48,954 --> 00:33:50,854
Little picket signs,
chanting and raving.

547
00:33:50,922 --> 00:33:53,288
Using little bullhorns
and shit like that.

548
00:33:53,358 --> 00:33:55,952
Screaming and hollering
your name out.

549
00:33:56,027 --> 00:33:58,222
Unfair practices.
Get me?

550
00:33:58,296 --> 00:34:00,594
No. No, no.
This is not a handicap thing.

551
00:34:00,665 --> 00:34:02,929
I have nothing
against you people.

552
00:34:04,469 --> 00:34:05,834
"You people"?

553
00:34:05,904 --> 00:34:08,702
Did you hear that, Marcus?
He said, "You people."

554
00:34:08,773 --> 00:34:10,070
Who the hell is "us people"?

555
00:34:10,141 --> 00:34:11,403
Wait. Wait.
No, no.

556
00:34:11,476 --> 00:34:13,706
I... You don't under...
What?

557
00:34:13,778 --> 00:34:15,769
He...
No, no.

558
00:34:15,847 --> 00:34:18,782
Um, you know, I think it's best

559
00:34:18,850 --> 00:34:21,717
if we just forget we had
this conversation.

560
00:34:23,521 --> 00:34:25,182
Okay.

561
00:34:25,257 --> 00:34:26,519
Good thinking.

562
00:34:26,591 --> 00:34:29,082
And don't worry about us.
We'll be fine.

563
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:31,594
Let's get the hell
out of here, Marcus.

564
00:34:36,668 --> 00:34:37,896
You're pathetic.

565
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:50,939
I dig that little thing
on your belly button.

566
00:34:51,016 --> 00:34:52,278
What's that?
Like a diamond?

567
00:34:52,350 --> 00:34:54,318
It's a belly-button ring.

568
00:34:54,386 --> 00:34:55,785
Oh, yeah?
Hang on a second.

569
00:34:55,854 --> 00:34:57,515
Check this out.

570
00:34:57,589 --> 00:35:00,319
You got to thrust.
See what I'm saying?

571
00:35:00,759 --> 00:35:03,990
You gotta move the ball around.
You go up there, baby.

572
00:35:04,062 --> 00:35:05,393
Come on.

573
00:35:05,463 --> 00:35:07,727
See? Move the ball.
There you go.

574
00:35:07,799 --> 00:35:10,029
Motherfucker!

575
00:35:10,101 --> 00:35:13,298
Oh, you lousy, fucking
motherfucker.

576
00:35:13,371 --> 00:35:15,339
[Grunting]

577
00:35:16,708 --> 00:35:18,642
That's the shit
that's gonna get us pinched.

578
00:35:18,710 --> 00:35:20,041
She said she was 18.

579
00:35:20,111 --> 00:35:21,510
But you promised no arcades.

580
00:35:21,579 --> 00:35:23,308
You said you'd only hustle
Big & Tall.

581
00:35:23,381 --> 00:35:26,179
You shat me out of your womb?
You're my fucking mom now?

582
00:35:26,251 --> 00:35:27,912
I don't need
any goddamn lectures.

583
00:35:27,986 --> 00:35:30,454
I know how to keep
a low profile. Thank you.

584
00:35:30,522 --> 00:35:31,580
[Car alarm deactivates]

585
00:35:31,656 --> 00:35:34,386
What the fuck is this,
Mr. Low Profile?

586
00:35:34,459 --> 00:35:36,723
Mind your own goddamn business.

587
00:35:44,436 --> 00:35:46,370
Ever hear of
the open bottle law?

588
00:35:48,573 --> 00:35:53,636
A couple of days ago, I was in,
uh, Women's Big & Tall.

589
00:35:53,712 --> 00:35:55,771
And I heard these...

590
00:35:55,847 --> 00:35:59,943
[Clears throat]
Um, you know, these noises.

591
00:36:00,018 --> 00:36:04,546
And I heard a woman screaming,
"Yeah. Oh, yeah."

592
00:36:04,622 --> 00:36:07,955
And I heard his voice saying,
"That's right.

593
00:36:08,026 --> 00:36:14,022
You ain't going to S-H-l-T
right for a month."

594
00:36:15,333 --> 00:36:16,800
But don't get me wrong.

595
00:36:16,868 --> 00:36:19,962
I was against
the Clinton impeachment.

596
00:36:20,038 --> 00:36:22,029
What a man does
with his own penis...

597
00:36:22,107 --> 00:36:24,200
Oval Office,
Women's Big & Tall...

598
00:36:24,275 --> 00:36:26,971
it's not for
the American people to say.

599
00:36:27,045 --> 00:36:27,773
Yeah, right.

600
00:36:27,846 --> 00:36:31,373
But when you're dealing
with children...

601
00:36:34,619 --> 00:36:37,053
They have a tender sensibility.

602
00:36:37,122 --> 00:36:38,987
And you are in a position
of trust.

603
00:36:39,057 --> 00:36:44,620
I think perhaps someone who has
screaming orgasms

604
00:36:44,696 --> 00:36:47,324
with large women shouldn't...

605
00:36:47,399 --> 00:36:48,889
Yeah.

606
00:36:50,201 --> 00:36:51,930
Of course,
I can't fire him for that.

607
00:36:52,003 --> 00:36:54,233
Oh, yeah.
Unfair practices.

608
00:36:54,305 --> 00:36:56,865
Special pleading.
Bitch, bitch, bitch.

609
00:36:56,941 --> 00:36:58,306
Fucking broads.

610
00:36:58,376 --> 00:36:59,638
But I just can't help it.

611
00:36:59,711 --> 00:37:03,169
There's something about the guy
that makes me uneasy.

612
00:37:03,248 --> 00:37:04,215
Well, sure.

613
00:37:04,282 --> 00:37:06,978
Santa fucking someone
in the ass.

614
00:37:09,154 --> 00:37:11,213
- So...
- [Coughs]

615
00:37:11,289 --> 00:37:13,849
Maybe there's something
I could fire him for.

616
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:16,092
Yeah, I get you.

617
00:37:16,161 --> 00:37:17,822
Do you?

618
00:37:17,896 --> 00:37:19,761
Do you think
you could find something?

619
00:37:19,831 --> 00:37:22,800
Shit, yeah.
There's always something.

620
00:37:30,542 --> 00:37:31,167
[Gulps]

621
00:37:46,024 --> 00:37:47,992
[Glass clinking]

622
00:37:48,059 --> 00:37:49,048
Shit.

623
00:37:50,261 --> 00:37:52,729
Hey, Opal.
Come here.

624
00:37:52,797 --> 00:37:53,991
Unh-unh.

625
00:37:54,065 --> 00:37:55,896
Screw you, Willie,
your kinky ass.

626
00:37:55,967 --> 00:37:57,832
Last time I didn't shit right
for a week.

627
00:37:57,902 --> 00:38:00,928
No, it's not that.
I need to talk to you.

628
00:38:01,005 --> 00:38:03,974
[Sighs]
I'm just tired of you, Willie.

629
00:38:04,909 --> 00:38:06,035
Ooh.

630
00:38:08,413 --> 00:38:10,347
Who the fuck is in my room?

631
00:38:10,415 --> 00:38:11,882
Did you see somebody
go in my room?

632
00:38:11,950 --> 00:38:14,077
Yeah.
Some guy asking about you.

633
00:38:14,152 --> 00:38:15,312
Looked like a cop.

634
00:38:15,386 --> 00:38:16,978
Oh, shit.

635
00:38:17,055 --> 00:38:18,215
[Rattling]

636
00:38:18,289 --> 00:38:19,415
Marcus, it's Willie.

637
00:38:19,491 --> 00:38:21,584
I just got back to the motel.

638
00:38:21,659 --> 00:38:23,991
Some guy is nosing around
in my room.

639
00:38:24,062 --> 00:38:25,689
What guy?
You get a look at him?

640
00:38:25,763 --> 00:38:27,390
No.
But I think he's a cop, though.

641
00:38:27,465 --> 00:38:28,591
Think somebody's onto us?

642
00:38:28,666 --> 00:38:30,930
Is there anything in the room?
Anything professional?

643
00:38:31,002 --> 00:38:32,435
No, I just got clothes in there.

644
00:38:32,504 --> 00:38:33,835
Just ditch, you idiot.

645
00:38:33,905 --> 00:38:35,998
You got anywhere to sack out
for a while?

646
00:38:37,008 --> 00:38:38,771
- Santa!
- Yeah.

647
00:38:38,843 --> 00:38:40,435
You're bringing
my present early?

648
00:38:40,512 --> 00:38:41,843
No.

649
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:44,580
But I never told you
what I wanted.

650
00:38:44,649 --> 00:38:47,482
I said I didn't bring it,
dipshit.

651
00:38:47,552 --> 00:38:49,019
Okay. Good.

652
00:38:49,087 --> 00:38:52,113
I want a stuffed elephant.
A pink one.

653
00:38:52,190 --> 00:38:54,181
Wish in one hand,
shit in the other one.

654
00:38:54,259 --> 00:38:57,092
See which one fills up first.

655
00:38:57,162 --> 00:38:58,595
Okay.

656
00:38:58,663 --> 00:39:00,858
So I'm gonna be staying here
for a while.

657
00:39:00,932 --> 00:39:02,957
Things are all fucked up
at the North Pole.

658
00:39:03,034 --> 00:39:05,059
Mrs. Santa caught me
fucking her sister.

659
00:39:05,136 --> 00:39:07,969
And I'm out on my ass now.

660
00:39:08,039 --> 00:39:09,904
She got half of everything.

661
00:39:09,974 --> 00:39:11,965
This is gonna be cool.

662
00:39:12,043 --> 00:39:13,874
This will do fine.

663
00:39:20,018 --> 00:39:22,009
So I'm gonna be crashing here.

664
00:39:22,086 --> 00:39:25,283
It will be just you and me,
like roommates, you know?

665
00:39:25,356 --> 00:39:27,517
Do you and Mrs. Santa have kids?

666
00:39:27,592 --> 00:39:29,219
No.
Thank the fuck Christ.

667
00:39:29,294 --> 00:39:31,262
What about the elves?

668
00:39:31,696 --> 00:39:34,290
Well, they stay with Mrs. Santa.

669
00:39:34,866 --> 00:39:36,595
I get them on the weekends.

670
00:39:36,668 --> 00:39:38,863
Why don't you go run me a bath?

671
00:39:42,707 --> 00:39:44,106
What about the reindeer?

672
00:39:44,175 --> 00:39:46,735
Would you please shut up
about reindeer?

673
00:39:48,313 --> 00:39:49,746
What are their names?

674
00:39:49,814 --> 00:39:50,803
Who?

675
00:39:50,882 --> 00:39:51,940
The elves.

676
00:39:52,016 --> 00:39:53,381
Oh, shit.
I can't remember.

677
00:39:53,451 --> 00:39:55,817
I think one of them is Sneezy.
There's a Dopey.

678
00:39:55,887 --> 00:39:57,787
That's the Seven Dwarfs.

679
00:39:57,855 --> 00:39:59,584
Oh, you're shitting me.

680
00:39:59,657 --> 00:40:02,751
I thought...
I was thinking it was the...

681
00:40:02,827 --> 00:40:04,089
I don't know.
Fuck, kid.

682
00:40:04,162 --> 00:40:06,255
I just call them, "bub."

683
00:40:06,331 --> 00:40:08,390
I say, "Hey, bub" or "chief"
or whatever the fuck.

684
00:40:08,466 --> 00:40:10,229
I tell him to make
the goddamn toy.

685
00:40:10,301 --> 00:40:12,269
What the fuck is wrong
with you?

686
00:40:12,337 --> 00:40:14,100
I can't remember this shit!

687
00:40:14,172 --> 00:40:17,198
Does everything with you
have to be a fucking test?

688
00:40:19,811 --> 00:40:21,210
How old are they?

689
00:40:21,279 --> 00:40:23,873
[Snoring]

690
00:40:26,718 --> 00:40:28,276
You want cookies?

691
00:40:29,187 --> 00:40:30,176
No.

692
00:40:30,255 --> 00:40:31,483
Warm milk?

693
00:40:31,556 --> 00:40:32,454
No.

694
00:40:32,523 --> 00:40:34,218
Should I fix you
some sandwiches?

695
00:40:34,292 --> 00:40:36,055
I don't want
any fucking sandwiches.

696
00:40:36,127 --> 00:40:38,618
What is it with you
and fixing fucking sandwiches?

697
00:40:38,696 --> 00:40:40,994
Okay.
Do you want anything else?

698
00:40:41,065 --> 00:40:42,692
No.

699
00:40:44,769 --> 00:40:46,236
Okay.

700
00:40:54,712 --> 00:40:56,577
Santa?

701
00:41:01,719 --> 00:41:02,947
What?

702
00:41:03,021 --> 00:41:05,581
I brought you some orange juice.

703
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:09,752
What's in it?

704
00:41:09,827 --> 00:41:11,419
Oranges.

705
00:41:14,198 --> 00:41:16,029
Look what I have.

706
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:18,159
An Advent calendar.

707
00:41:18,236 --> 00:41:19,362
What the hell is that?

708
00:41:19,437 --> 00:41:23,203
It's the story of Christmas,
but in a calendar.

709
00:41:23,274 --> 00:41:25,299
Every day you peel open
a new box.

710
00:41:25,376 --> 00:41:26,968
You get part of the story.

711
00:41:27,045 --> 00:41:29,036
And then there's
a chocolate inside.

712
00:41:29,113 --> 00:41:31,741
Do you want to open up
today's box and read it?

713
00:41:32,717 --> 00:41:34,651
No.
You go ahead.

714
00:41:36,621 --> 00:41:40,022
Jesus Christ, kid.
Watch the nuts.

715
00:41:47,598 --> 00:41:51,227
"So Joseph went up from
the town of Nazareth in Galilee

716
00:41:51,302 --> 00:41:54,294
to Judea, to Bethlehem,
the town of David.

717
00:41:54,372 --> 00:41:57,307
In those days Caesar Augustus
issued a decree

718
00:41:57,375 --> 00:42:00,401
that a census should be taken
of the entire Roman world.

719
00:42:00,478 --> 00:42:03,641
Everyone went to his hometown
to register."

720

- That it?
- Yep.

721
00:42:08,519 --> 00:42:10,851
That's an awesome
fucking story, kid.

722
00:42:10,922 --> 00:42:14,380
There's more to it, but we
have to wait till tomorrow.

723
00:42:15,793 --> 00:42:18,023
Do you want to eat
the chocolate?

724
00:42:19,097 --> 00:42:20,155
You go ahead.

725
00:42:23,368 --> 00:42:25,632
Are you coming downstairs?

726
00:42:25,703 --> 00:42:28,365
I'll be down in a minute.
I got to go to work.

727
00:42:39,784 --> 00:42:41,046
Fuck me?
Fuck you.

728
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:43,110
You can't just take up
with some kid.

729
00:42:43,187 --> 00:42:45,553
You don't know who's around
or what they do.

730
00:42:45,623 --> 00:42:48,057
You got some nerve,
you little shit, you.

731
00:42:48,126 --> 00:42:50,788
What, you're my mom now?
You shat me out of your womb?

732
00:42:50,862 --> 00:42:54,298
You said that yesterday,
you stupid fuck.

733
00:42:54,365 --> 00:42:55,992
Shit.

Fuck you.

735
00:43:07,512 --> 00:43:09,810
You are by far the dumbest,

736
00:43:09,881 --> 00:43:12,509
most pathetic piece
of maggot-eating shit

737
00:43:12,583 --> 00:43:16,019
that has ever slid
from a human being's hairy ass.

738
00:43:16,888 --> 00:43:19,618
What if the kid has one of those
fucking playdates they have now?

739
00:43:19,690 --> 00:43:22,420
Are you shitting me?
The kid don't have any friends.

740
00:43:22,493 --> 00:43:25,621
He don't even have an imaginary
friend unless he ditched him.

741
00:43:25,696 --> 00:43:28,665
He lives with his drooling-ass
old grandmother.

all the time.

743

You think she's gonna
rat me out?

744
00:43:31,969 --> 00:43:34,904
She don't know her ass
from last Tuesday.

745
00:43:35,540 --> 00:43:36,905
You fuck her?

Jesus Christ.

747
00:43:39,744 --> 00:43:41,644
Is everything fucking sex
with you?

748
00:43:41,712 --> 00:43:43,771
With me?
I fuck one person.

749
00:43:43,848 --> 00:43:45,372
I ain't out there

what a piece of shit I am.

Yeah, that's right.

Go ahead.
Talk about my height.

'cause you're
an emotional cripple.

It's Santa.

Are you insane?

767
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:44,437
Management's gonna hear
about this.

768
00:44:44,509 --> 00:44:46,943
You think that's a threat?

769
00:44:47,011 --> 00:44:50,174
If you think you can make my
life any worse, go right ahead.

770
00:44:50,248 --> 00:44:53,012

When I look at you,
you know what I think?

I think America has
a sad future ahead of it.

00:51:15,232 --> 00:51:17,564
So, you'll call me, right?

881
00:51:17,635 --> 00:51:20,399
Yeah.
I'll call you.

882
00:51:20,471 --> 00:51:21,802
I'm gonna buy you some flowers.

883
00:51:21,872 --> 00:51:24,306
Some of those
really good expensive ones.

884
00:51:24,375 --> 00:51:25,637
Shut up.

885
00:51:27,912 --> 00:51:29,846
[Chuckles]
Bye.

886
00:52:34,178 --> 00:52:35,645
[Kid screaming]

887
00:52:37,414 --> 00:52:38,904
Roger, you're home.

888
00:52:38,983 --> 00:52:41,679
Let me fix you some sandwiches.

889
00:52:43,954 --> 00:52:44,943
What the fuck?

890
00:52:45,022 --> 00:52:48,423
Kid, what the fuck
is wrong with you?

891
00:52:49,994 --> 00:52:51,859
[Screaming continues]

892
00:52:53,464 --> 00:52:54,863
Jesus Christ!

893
00:52:54,932 --> 00:52:56,399
Let me see it!
Let me see it!

894
00:52:56,467 --> 00:52:57,764
What the hell happened to you?!

895
00:52:57,835 --> 00:53:01,066
I cut my hand by mistake!
Ow!

896
00:53:01,138 --> 00:53:03,698
- Of course it was by mistake.
- Ow!

897
00:53:03,774 --> 00:53:05,765
Here, hold still.
Hold still.

898
00:53:05,843 --> 00:53:07,242
[Screaming intensifies]

899
00:53:07,311 --> 00:53:09,506
I was just trying to help you!

900
00:53:09,580 --> 00:53:12,447
I forgot to say,
"It's gonna sting a little bit."

901
00:53:12,516 --> 00:53:15,007
Shouldn't I wrap it
in a T-shirt or something?

902
00:53:15,085 --> 00:53:16,780
God damn it.

903
00:53:21,258 --> 00:53:24,159
- Hey, kid?
- [Screaming continues]

904
00:53:25,329 --> 00:53:27,889
Kid, you okay up there?

905
00:53:27,965 --> 00:53:30,490
You need a Band-Aid
or something?

906
00:53:30,567 --> 00:53:33,001
[Screaming continues]

907
00:53:37,474 --> 00:53:39,669
[Screaming stops]

908
00:53:39,743 --> 00:53:41,836
Aw, shit.

909
00:53:50,654 --> 00:53:51,848
You're late.

910
00:53:58,829 --> 00:54:00,421
Kids.
Let me tell you.

911
00:54:03,934 --> 00:54:05,765
They run you ragged.

912
00:54:17,448 --> 00:54:19,643
Morning, team.

913
00:54:20,184 --> 00:54:21,276
Hey, hey, hey.

914
00:54:21,351 --> 00:54:23,615
It's not quite 8:00 yet.

915
00:54:24,621 --> 00:54:26,646
Well, how close are we?

916
00:54:31,161 --> 00:54:32,492
Now it's 8:00.

917
00:54:32,563 --> 00:54:33,655
Merry Christmas.

918
00:54:33,730 --> 00:54:35,698
Up your ass.

919
00:54:42,039 --> 00:54:43,404
God damn it!

920
00:54:43,474 --> 00:54:45,032
You tear your ball again?

921
00:54:45,109 --> 00:54:46,371
I don't think so.

922
00:54:46,443 --> 00:54:49,037
That's it.

923
00:54:55,385 --> 00:54:57,012
[Thudding]

924
00:55:00,324 --> 00:55:02,258
[Crash]

925
00:55:05,562 --> 00:55:07,689
[Muffled] God damn it!

926
00:55:22,746 --> 00:55:24,771
Sweetheart,
don't romance 'em, now.

927
00:55:24,848 --> 00:55:26,509
Go on and get in there.
I can take it.

928
00:55:26,583 --> 00:55:28,312
[Cellphone rings]

929
00:55:29,153 --> 00:55:30,051
Yeah.

930
00:55:30,120 --> 00:55:32,111
Gin, I got the info
on that Arizona plate.

931
00:55:32,189 --> 00:55:34,157
All right.
Now you're talking.

932
00:55:34,224 --> 00:55:36,249
Oh, hold on one minute.

933
00:55:36,326 --> 00:55:38,726
Baby, baby. Baby, baby.
Don't use that one.

934
00:55:38,795 --> 00:55:39,853
That's not the stuff.

935
00:55:39,930 --> 00:55:42,228
Use something
with some claws to it.

936
00:55:42,299 --> 00:55:44,699
Yeah, that hard candy.
That's it right there.

937
00:55:44,768 --> 00:55:48,033
Let me get some of that.
Yeah, that's it.

938
00:55:48,105 --> 00:55:49,436
Okay.

939
00:55:49,506 --> 00:55:50,438
Yeah, I'm back.

940
00:55:50,507 --> 00:55:51,940
The guy's Roger Merman.

941
00:55:52,009 --> 00:55:54,239
- Guess where he is.
- Give it to me.

942
00:55:54,311 --> 00:55:57,405
Ow! Damn it!
What's wrong with you, woman?

943
00:56:06,823 --> 00:56:08,415
Who are you?

944
00:56:08,492 --> 00:56:09,720
Your name Roger Merman?

945
00:56:09,793 --> 00:56:10,782
Yes. But...

946
00:56:10,861 --> 00:56:12,590
You doing three to six
for embezzlement?

947
00:56:12,663 --> 00:56:17,259
Uh, well, many accounting
questions are not cut-and-dried.

948
00:56:17,334 --> 00:56:19,768
Do you live at 41 Sage Terrace?

949
00:56:19,836 --> 00:56:21,804
Is it Grandma?

950
00:56:21,872 --> 00:56:23,066
Is my son all right?

951
00:56:23,140 --> 00:56:24,471
They're fine.

952
00:56:24,541 --> 00:56:26,839
Do you have any houseguests?

953
00:56:27,544 --> 00:56:28,670
Houseguests?

954
00:56:30,581 --> 00:56:33,072
Thank you for your time.
God bless.

955
00:56:33,750 --> 00:56:35,809
Well, hey, who are you?

956
00:56:38,088 --> 00:56:40,283
Houseguests?

957
00:56:43,360 --> 00:56:45,920
Little trick I learned
up at the North Pole.

958
00:56:45,996 --> 00:56:48,760
If you fry baloney,
it tastes like a hot dog.

959
00:56:48,832 --> 00:56:50,732
I thought you
didn't like sandwiches.

960
00:56:50,801 --> 00:56:52,735
Yeah, but this
is not a sandwich.

961
00:56:52,803 --> 00:56:54,361
A sandwich has
two pieces of bread

962
00:56:54,438 --> 00:56:56,269
with a bunch of junk on it.

963
00:56:57,507 --> 00:56:59,031
It's like a tostada.

964
00:56:59,109 --> 00:57:01,703
This isn't a tostada.

965
00:57:01,778 --> 00:57:03,109
There you go, Granny.

966
00:57:04,114 --> 00:57:06,446
Little salsa here.

967
00:57:07,517 --> 00:57:09,917
Now it's a tostada.

968
00:57:10,520 --> 00:57:12,283
Have you seen
my Advent calendar?

969
00:57:12,356 --> 00:57:14,756
What the fuck is it
with the Advent calendar?

970
00:57:14,825 --> 00:57:16,986
Why are you so obsessed
with that goddamn thing?

971
00:57:17,060 --> 00:57:19,051
The story sucks anyway.

972
00:57:23,133 --> 00:57:24,691
I think I saw it in the hallway.

973
00:57:24,768 --> 00:57:26,497
- Really?
- I think so.

974
00:57:35,279 --> 00:57:38,043
Looks like someone messed
with my Advent calendar.

975
00:57:38,115 --> 00:57:40,675
What are you talking about?
Let me see.

976
00:57:41,918 --> 00:57:44,284
Nobody messed with it.
It looks fine.

977
00:57:58,935 --> 00:58:01,699
There's a candy corn
in this one.

978
00:58:01,772 --> 00:58:04,400
Well, they can't all be winners,
can they?

979
00:58:09,346 --> 00:58:12,315
Well, it's fucked.

980
00:58:12,382 --> 00:58:13,781
Yeah?

981
00:58:13,850 --> 00:58:15,477
Yeah.

982
00:58:15,552 --> 00:58:17,247
- Fucked, frankly.
- He's...

983
00:58:17,321 --> 00:58:18,913
- Clean...
- Oh.

984
00:58:18,989 --> 00:58:20,684
- As a fucking whistle.
- Nothing?

985
00:58:20,757 --> 00:58:22,054
- No.
- Oh.

986
00:58:22,125 --> 00:58:24,059
- Nothing. I mean shit.
- Yeah.

987
00:58:24,127 --> 00:58:25,389
- He curses.
- Yeah?

988
00:58:25,462 --> 00:58:27,259
- But never around children.
- Oh.

989
00:58:27,331 --> 00:58:28,764
- No criminal record.
- Yeah.

990
00:58:28,832 --> 00:58:31,426
- No parking tickets.
- Nothing.

991
00:58:31,501 --> 00:58:33,594
- No bad habits, even.
- Oh.

992
00:58:33,670 --> 00:58:34,967
Sex, yeah.

993
00:58:35,038 --> 00:58:37,700
- But man is a sexual being.
- Yeah.

994
00:58:37,774 --> 00:58:39,571
- Fuckin' Darwinian.
- Oh.

995
00:58:39,643 --> 00:58:41,702
- You can't do shit about that.
- No.

996
00:58:41,778 --> 00:58:43,473
Hell, I wouldn't want to.

997
00:58:46,450 --> 00:58:49,942
No, of course not.
I'm not advocating celibacy.

998
00:58:50,020 --> 00:58:52,784
Hope not. It'd be the end
of the fucking human race.

999
00:58:52,856 --> 00:58:54,619
Yeah.

1000
00:58:54,691 --> 00:58:56,352
Fucks large women.

1001
00:58:57,227 --> 00:58:58,888
What can I say?

1002
00:59:11,908 --> 00:59:14,399
Hey, look,
it's the retard again.

1003
00:59:25,255 --> 00:59:26,222
Wedgie.

1004
00:59:26,289 --> 00:59:27,950
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1005
00:59:28,024 --> 00:59:29,286
[Screaming]

1006
00:59:29,359 --> 00:59:30,257
[Rip]

1007
00:59:30,327 --> 00:59:31,794
Well, what the hell do you want?

1008
00:59:31,862 --> 00:59:33,261
Pokémon!

1009
00:59:33,330 --> 00:59:34,695
Done.

1010
00:59:39,069 --> 00:59:42,300
You probably shouldn't
be digging in your ass.

1011
00:59:43,540 --> 00:59:45,371
Santa...

1012
00:59:45,442 --> 00:59:46,875
[Children laughing]

1013
00:59:46,943 --> 00:59:48,740
Oh, jeez.

1014
00:59:52,082 --> 00:59:54,482
- Is that your underwear?
- Part of it.

1015
00:59:54,551 --> 00:59:56,348
Where the hell's the rest of it?

1016
00:59:56,420 --> 00:59:58,888
No, actually, don't tell me.
What do you want?

1017
00:59:58,955 --> 01:00:02,516
I was thinking I wanted a purple
stuffed elephant, not pink.

1018
01:00:02,592 --> 01:00:04,287
But now I changed my mind.

1019
01:00:04,361 --> 01:00:07,296
- Yeah, what?
- Now I don't want an elephant.

1020
01:00:07,364 --> 01:00:08,922
I want a gorilla named Davey

1021
01:00:08,999 --> 01:00:11,866
for beating up the skateboard
kids who pull on my underwear.

1022
01:00:11,935 --> 01:00:14,301
He could take his orders
from the talking walnut,

1023
01:00:14,371 --> 01:00:16,805
so it wouldn't be my bad thing.

1024
01:00:21,411 --> 01:00:22,639
Jesus, kid.

1025
01:00:22,712 --> 01:00:24,976
When I was your age,
I didn't need no gorilla,

1026
01:00:25,048 --> 01:00:27,016
and I wasn't as big
as one of your legs.

1027
01:00:27,083 --> 01:00:29,483
Four kids beat me up
and I went crying to my daddy.

1028
01:00:29,553 --> 01:00:31,418
- You know what he did?
- He made it all better?

1029
01:00:31,488 --> 01:00:34,252
No, he kicked my ass.
You know why?

1030
01:00:34,324 --> 01:00:37,225
'Cause you went to the bathroom
on Mommy's dishes?

1031
01:00:37,294 --> 01:00:38,886
What the fuck?

1032
01:00:38,962 --> 01:00:39,826
No.

1033
01:00:39,896 --> 01:00:42,558
He tried to teach you
not to cry and be a man?

1034
01:00:42,632 --> 01:00:46,796
No. It's because he was
a mean, drunk son of a bitch.

1035
01:00:46,870 --> 01:00:48,531
When he wasn't busting my ass,

1036
01:00:48,605 --> 01:00:50,436
he was putting cigarettes out
on my neck.

1037
01:00:50,507 --> 01:00:51,838
The world ain't fair.

1038
01:00:51,908 --> 01:00:54,308
You gotta take what you need
when you can get it.

1039
01:00:54,377 --> 01:00:57,073
Learn to stand up for yourself.
Quit being a pussy.

1040
01:00:57,147 --> 01:00:59,809
Kick these kids
in the balls or something.

1041
01:01:01,451 --> 01:01:03,009
Or don't.
Shit, I don't care.

1042
01:01:03,086 --> 01:01:05,577
Just leave me out of it.
Now, get on out of here.

1043
01:01:05,655 --> 01:01:08,180
Okay.
Thanks, Santa.

1044
01:01:22,639 --> 01:01:25,107
Go get the next lucky boy
or girl, okay?

1045
01:01:26,443 --> 01:01:28,206
All right, next.

1046
01:01:30,046 --> 01:01:32,378
Open the ropes there, Marcus.

1047
01:01:33,416 --> 01:01:34,610
I know you?

1048
01:01:34,684 --> 01:01:35,708
Not yet.

1049
01:01:37,921 --> 01:01:40,185
Seven cities in seven years.

1050
01:01:40,257 --> 01:01:41,918
Pretty impressive.

1051
01:01:41,992 --> 01:01:44,290
The store changes,
your name changes.

1052
01:01:44,361 --> 01:01:46,829
But you always get away clean.

1053
01:01:46,897 --> 01:01:48,159
Yeah.

1054
01:01:48,231 --> 01:01:50,131
Pretty darn impressive.

1055
01:01:50,200 --> 01:01:51,792
Well, let's face the facts.

1056
01:01:51,868 --> 01:01:54,098
Y'all are a couple
of half-bucket small-timers.

1057
01:01:54,170 --> 01:01:57,401
You, because of your physical
attributes, found a niche,

1058
01:01:57,474 --> 01:01:58,998
and I respect that.

1059
01:01:59,075 --> 01:02:01,100
But you also been caught...

1060
01:02:02,212 --> 01:02:03,338
...by me.

1061
01:02:03,413 --> 01:02:06,246
So this is how it's gonna be.

1062
01:02:06,316 --> 01:02:07,943
I don't want to take over.

1063
01:02:08,018 --> 01:02:10,282
I don't even want to change
your scam.

1064
01:02:10,353 --> 01:02:12,446
Whatever you guys do, it works.

1065
01:02:12,522 --> 01:02:14,422
All I want is a taste.

1066
01:02:14,491 --> 01:02:17,016
When the deed is done,
we part ways.

1067
01:02:17,093 --> 01:02:18,924
I'll buy a little ranch
in Havasu,

1068
01:02:18,995 --> 01:02:22,362
and you all take your little
medicine show back on the road.

1069
01:02:25,001 --> 01:02:26,298
- How much?
- Half.

1070
01:02:26,369 --> 01:02:28,667
No way! You don't know
who you're fucking with.

1071
01:02:28,738 --> 01:02:31,901
Back off, Will.
I got this. I got this!

1072
01:02:33,310 --> 01:02:35,175
Okay. 30%.

1073
01:02:35,245 --> 01:02:38,043
There's three of us.
30%. That's fair.

1074
01:02:38,114 --> 01:02:39,809
Half.

1075
01:02:39,883 --> 01:02:41,180
I meant 33%...

1076
01:02:41,251 --> 01:02:42,115
I meant half.

1077
01:02:42,185 --> 01:02:43,209
...and 1/3.

1078
01:02:43,286 --> 01:02:44,776
Half.

1079
01:02:46,089 --> 01:02:47,283
35%.

1080
01:02:48,224 --> 01:02:48,952
Half.

1081
01:02:49,025 --> 01:02:50,686
40%.

1082
01:02:51,861 --> 01:02:53,294
Half.

1083
01:02:55,332 --> 01:02:56,697
42%.

1084
01:02:58,868 --> 01:03:00,233
Half.

1085
01:03:05,208 --> 01:03:06,368
45%.

1086
01:03:12,415 --> 01:03:14,007
Half.

1087
01:03:15,118 --> 01:03:16,107
48%?

1088
01:03:17,287 --> 01:03:19,346
[British accent]
Half.

1089
01:03:20,090 --> 01:03:21,114
49%.

1090
01:03:21,191 --> 01:03:22,624
Half.

1091
01:03:24,294 --> 01:03:26,159
Well, what's one point?

1092
01:03:26,229 --> 01:03:28,163
We split the dough
right down the middle.

1093
01:03:28,231 --> 01:03:30,699
Any merchandise you take, I get
to look at and cherry-pick.

1094
01:03:30,767 --> 01:03:33,099
No! Money's one thing,
but you ain't gettin' the...

1095
01:03:33,169 --> 01:03:35,603
This ain't no Chinese menu,
jagoff.

1096
01:03:35,672 --> 01:03:38,232
I tell you how it's gonna be.

1097
01:03:38,308 --> 01:03:40,674
This is pricks fix.

1098
01:03:46,149 --> 01:03:47,207
Pricks fix?

1099
01:03:47,283 --> 01:03:49,217
He's a fucking moron.

1100
01:03:49,285 --> 01:03:50,183
Oh, really?

1101
01:03:50,253 --> 01:03:52,050
Is that how you got
the upper hand?

1102
01:03:52,122 --> 01:03:53,020
Fuck you.

1103
01:03:53,089 --> 01:03:54,078
Negotiating?

1104
01:03:54,157 --> 01:03:56,022
If you don't like,
next year, fuck off.

1105
01:03:56,092 --> 01:03:57,855
I can always get
another box jockey.

1106
01:03:57,927 --> 01:03:59,292
I can get another midget, too.

1107
01:03:59,362 --> 01:04:00,590
Yeah, where?

1108
01:04:00,664 --> 01:04:03,690
You see us hanging off of trees
like fucking crab apples?

1109
01:04:03,767 --> 01:04:06,201
Even if we did, you'd never
front your own racket.

1110
01:04:06,269 --> 01:04:08,601
You know why, Willie?
You got no discipline.

1111
01:04:08,672 --> 01:04:12,005
You got zero fuckin' initiative.
You'd fall apart without me.

1112
01:04:12,075 --> 01:04:13,702
You're too pathetic for words.

1113
01:04:13,777 --> 01:04:16,541
You're a fucking loser,
and you fucking know it.

01:05:30,487 --> 01:05:32,478
Sweet Jews for Jesus.

1135
01:05:32,555 --> 01:05:34,580
[Grunts]
I pissed myself.

1136
01:05:34,657 --> 01:05:36,352
What the fuck
do you think you doing?

1137
01:05:36,426 --> 01:05:38,257
You son of a bitch!

1138
01:05:38,328 --> 01:05:39,488
Hey, hey, hey.
Hey, hey.

1139
01:05:39,562 --> 01:05:40,927
Hey, come on, come on.

1140
01:05:40,997 --> 01:05:42,624
Look, hey!
Come on, come on!

1141
01:05:42,699 --> 01:05:44,633
Look here.
Get him out of here.

1142
01:05:44,701 --> 01:05:46,328
I'll smooth things over
with Chipeska.

1143
01:05:46,402 --> 01:05:49,166
- Tell him food poisoning.
- "Get him out of here"?

1144
01:05:49,239 --> 01:05:50,570
Take him to the car.

1145
01:05:50,640 --> 01:05:53,632
In case you hadn't noticed,
I'm a motherfuckin' dwarf.

1146
01:05:53,710 --> 01:05:55,701
So unless you got
a forklift handy,

1147
01:05:55,779 --> 01:05:57,713
maybe you should
lend a hand, hmm?

1148
01:05:57,781 --> 01:05:59,840
That figures. You want
all kind of set-asides.

1149
01:05:59,916 --> 01:06:01,781
Special treatment
'cause you're handicapped.

1150
01:06:01,851 --> 01:06:02,749
You all the same.

1151
01:06:02,819 --> 01:06:03,911
Special treatment?

1152
01:06:03,987 --> 01:06:06,319
I'm 3-foot-fucking-tall,
you asshole!

1153
01:06:06,389 --> 01:06:07,981
It's a matter of physics.

1154
01:06:08,057 --> 01:06:10,525
Draw me a sketch of how
I get him to the car, huh?

1155
01:06:10,593 --> 01:06:12,356
Bitch, bitch, bitch.

1156
01:06:12,428 --> 01:06:14,055
Sketch it up, you moron.

1157
01:06:14,130 --> 01:06:16,690
Fucking Leonardo da Vinci.

1158
01:06:17,967 --> 01:06:19,434
What you call me, thigh high?

1159
01:06:19,502 --> 01:06:21,163
I called you
a fucking guinea homo

1160
01:06:21,237 --> 01:06:23,569
from the 15th-fucking-century,
you dickhead!

1161
01:06:23,640 --> 01:06:25,733
I could stick you up my ass,
small fry.

1162
01:06:25,809 --> 01:06:28,471
Yeah? You sure it ain't
too sore from last night?

1163
01:06:28,545 --> 01:06:30,376
You got some lip on you, midget.

1164
01:06:30,446 --> 01:06:33,279
Well, these lips were on
your wife's pussy last night.

1165
01:06:33,349 --> 01:06:36,113
Why don't you dust that
thing off once in a while?

1166
01:06:36,186 --> 01:06:37,744
Asshole.

1167
01:06:42,225 --> 01:06:43,522
I pissed my pants.

1168
01:06:43,593 --> 01:06:44,924
Oh, shut up.

1169
01:07:09,719 --> 01:07:11,619
Santa.

1170
01:07:21,297 --> 01:07:22,924
Santa?

1171
01:07:24,300 --> 01:07:25,699
What?

1172
01:07:27,003 --> 01:07:28,800
What are you doing?

1173
01:07:30,173 --> 01:07:31,640
Nothing.

1174
01:07:32,675 --> 01:07:34,643
You going to work today?

1175
01:07:38,014 --> 01:07:39,879
Not really.

1176
01:07:39,949 --> 01:07:42,679
You just gonna sit there?

1177
01:07:44,821 --> 01:07:45,753
Yeah.

1178
01:07:45,822 --> 01:07:48,518
Just let me alone, okay?

1179
01:07:51,995 --> 01:07:53,963
Hey, wait a minute.
Hey, kid?

1180
01:07:54,030 --> 01:07:55,497
Yeah?

1181
01:07:59,535 --> 01:08:01,400
I want you to take this letter.

1182
01:08:01,471 --> 01:08:05,601
When the paramedics come
to bag Santa up,

1183
01:08:05,675 --> 01:08:07,700
there's gonna be
some cops there.

1184
01:08:07,777 --> 01:08:10,974
I want you to make sure that
those cops get that envelope.

1185
01:08:11,047 --> 01:08:12,912
What is it?

1186
01:08:12,982 --> 01:08:15,974
It just tells
all the bad things that...

1187
01:08:18,388 --> 01:08:20,879
What the fuck happened
to your eye?

1188
01:08:22,091 --> 01:08:23,524
Fucking little prick!

1189
01:08:26,362 --> 01:08:29,126
So you like to give little kids
black eyes, huh?

1190
01:08:31,634 --> 01:08:33,761
How 'bout you, huh?!
You want some?!

1191
01:08:33,836 --> 01:08:36,430
Anybody else?
Anybody else? Come on!

1192
01:08:36,506 --> 01:08:38,235
Yeah, there you go.

1193
01:08:56,192 --> 01:08:58,820
You know, I think
I've turned a corner.

1194
01:08:59,562 --> 01:09:02,998
Yeah?
You fucking petites now?

1195
01:09:03,066 --> 01:09:05,432
No. I'm not talking about that.

1196
01:09:07,537 --> 01:09:11,098
I beat the shit
out of some kids today.

1197
01:09:11,174 --> 01:09:13,438
But it was for a purpose.

1198
01:09:15,812 --> 01:09:18,406
It made me feel good
about myself.

1199
01:09:20,049 --> 01:09:22,609
It was like I did something
constructive with my life.

1200
01:09:22,685 --> 01:09:24,448
I don't know.

1201
01:09:24,520 --> 01:09:26,852
Like I accomplished something.

1202
01:09:30,226 --> 01:09:33,093
You need many years of therapy.

1203
01:09:33,162 --> 01:09:37,223
Many, many, many
fuckin' years of therapy.

1204
01:09:38,001 --> 01:09:40,561
Okay. You don't drink,
which is smart on your part.

1205
01:09:40,636 --> 01:09:42,729
But being sober can put you
at a disadvantage

1206
01:09:42,805 --> 01:09:44,272
when it comes to violence.

1207
01:09:44,340 --> 01:09:46,501
I can't box worth a shit, see.

1208
01:09:46,576 --> 01:09:50,410
But I'm good in a fight
because I can't feel anything.

1209
01:09:50,480 --> 01:09:53,005
You, you're gonna feel
everything.

1210
01:09:54,283 --> 01:09:55,750
Okay.

1211
01:09:55,818 --> 01:09:59,515
Now put your dukes up.
Let me see what you got.

1212
01:09:59,589 --> 01:10:00,613
This is bullshit!

1213
01:10:00,690 --> 01:10:04,023
Give me one good reason why I
should even consider doing this.

1214
01:10:04,093 --> 01:10:06,618
'Cause I let 2,000 kids
spit in my face for your ass.

1215
01:10:06,696 --> 01:10:07,754
That's why.

1216
01:10:07,830 --> 01:10:09,593
Now, I'm asking you
for this one thing.

1217
01:10:09,665 --> 01:10:11,360
Come on, look at the kid.

1218
01:10:12,802 --> 01:10:14,064
He is pathetic.

1219
01:10:14,137 --> 01:10:15,729
Yeah, he's just a little...

1220
01:10:15,805 --> 01:10:17,966
He's a fucking retard.

1221
01:10:19,175 --> 01:10:21,302
Yeah, let's show him
a couple of things

1222
01:10:21,377 --> 01:10:22,708
so he can defend himself, then.

1223
01:10:22,779 --> 01:10:24,406
Unless you're scared.

1224
01:10:25,848 --> 01:10:27,645
All right,
here's what's gonna happen.

1225
01:10:27,717 --> 01:10:29,116
Marcus is a bully, right?

1226
01:10:29,185 --> 01:10:31,153
He's gonna pull your underwear
up out of your pants.

1227
01:10:31,220 --> 01:10:32,448
Now, what do you do?

1228
01:10:32,522 --> 01:10:33,580
I don't know.

1229
01:10:33,656 --> 01:10:34,918

your present now.

00:26:36,887 --> 00:26:38,056
Yes, you do.

Hello, Cooper.

MAN:
Explain to me how you found this facility.

348
00:26:55,365 --> 00:26:58,660
Kind of an accident. We sort of stumbled
upon it. We were on a salvage run--

349
00:26:58,826 --> 00:27:01,538
You're sitting in the best-kept secret
in the world.

350
00:27:01,703 --> 00:27:05,208
Nobody stumbles in here.
Nobody stumbles out.

351
00:27:05,541 --> 00:27:07,210

Cooper, please.

352
00:27:07,669 --> 00:27:09,753
Cooperate with these people.

353
00:27:09,921 --> 00:27:11,131
Look.

354
00:27:12,048 --> 00:27:13,715
It's kind of hard to explain.

355
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:18,221
We learned these coordinates
from an anomaly.

356
00:27:18,971 --> 00:27:20,306
What sort of anomaly?

357
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:23,768
I hesitate to term it supernatural,
but it definitely wasn't scientific.

358
00:27:23,934 --> 00:27:27,855
You're going to have to be specific,
Mr. Cooper. Right now.

359
00:27:28,021 --> 00:27:29,273
It was gravity.

360
00:27:32,943 --> 00:27:37,156
Um, what sort of gravitational anomaly?
Where was this?

361
00:27:37,323 --> 00:27:40,617
Now, I'm real happy that you're excited
about gravity, bud...

362
00:27:40,785 --> 00:27:43,997
...but you're not getting any answers from us
until I get assurances.

363
00:27:44,163 --> 00:27:45,455
- Assurances?
COOPER: Yeah.

00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:49,751
Like, that we're getting out of here.
And I don't mean in the trunk of some car.

from the stratosphere...

...onto starving people.

375
00:28:23,118 --> 00:28:25,454
When they realized
that killing other people was...

376
00:28:25,622 --> 00:28:28,458
...not a long-term solution,
then they needed us back.

377
00:28:28,625 --> 00:28:30,626
- In secret.
-Why secret?

378

allow spending on space exploration.

But like the potatoes in Ireland
and the wheat in the Dust Bowl...

But it is our home.

Earth's atmosphere is 80 percent nitrogen.

We don't even breathe nitrogen.

394
00:29:23,054 --> 00:29:28,393
Blight does. And as it thrives,
our air gets less and less oxygen.

The last components of our one versatile ship
in orbit, the Endurance.

- Oh, that sounds cheerful.
-Lazarus came back from the dead.

409
00:30:19,902 --> 00:30:21,903
Sure, but he had to die in the first place.

410
00:30:22,529 --> 00:30:25,240
There's not a planet in our solar system
that could sustain life...

411
00:30:25,407 --> 00:30:27,910
...and the nearest star's
over a thousand years away.

-I barely left the stratosphere.

This team never left the simulator.

419

We need a pilot, and this is the mission
that you were trained for.

420
00:30:50,724 --> 00:30:52,226
Without even knowing it?

421
00:30:53,269 --> 00:30:57,522
An hour ago, you didn't even know I was alive.
You were going anyway.

422
00:30:57,690 --> 00:30:59,400
We had no choice.

423
00:30:59,567 --> 00:31:01,318
But something sent you here.

424
00:31:01,652 --> 00:31:04,364
- They chose you.
-Who's "they"?

00:31:12,329 --> 00:31:14,248

426
00:31:14,832 --> 00:31:17,751
Hard to know. Years?

00:31:18,461 --> 00:31:20,087

Who's "they"?

430
00:31:27,553 --> 00:31:31,348
We started detecting gravitational anomalies
almost 50 years ago.

431
00:31:31,682 --> 00:31:35,310
Mostly small distortions to our instruments
in the upper atmosphere.

432
00:31:35,478 --> 00:31:38,605
In fact, I believe
you encountered one yourself.

433
00:31:39,272 --> 00:31:41,275
Yeah, over the Straights.

434
00:31:42,276 --> 00:31:45,320
My crash. Something tripped my fly-by-wire.

435
00:31:45,488 --> 00:31:46,697
Exactly.

436
00:31:47,531 --> 00:31:52,452
But of all these anomalies,
the most significant is this:

437
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:54,622
Out near Saturn...

438
00:31:54,788 --> 00:31:56,874
...a disturbance of space-time.

439
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,130
- Is that a Wormhole?
-It appeared 48 years ago.

440
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:04,507
And it leads where?

441
00:32:05,048 --> 00:32:06,675
Another galaxy.

442
00:32:08,428 --> 00:32:10,680
A wormhole's not
a naturally occurring phenomenon.

443
00:32:10,846 --> 00:32:12,265
Someone placed it there.

444
00:32:13,057 --> 00:32:14,558
-"They"?
-Mm.

445
00:32:15,058 --> 00:32:19,146
And whoever they are,
they appear to be looking out for us.

446
00:32:19,605 --> 00:32:22,191
That Wormhole lets us travel to other stars.

447
00:32:22,357 --> 00:32:24,277
It came along right as we needed it.

448
00:32:24,443 --> 00:32:27,363
They've put potentially habitable worlds
right within our reach.

449
00:32:27,529 --> 00:32:29,449
Twelve, in fact, from our initial probes.

450
00:32:29,615 --> 00:32:31,992
- You sent probes into that?
-Mm-hm.

451
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:35,163

Twelve possible worlds...

454
00:32:39,875 --> 00:32:42,211
...twelve Ranger launches carrying...

455
00:32:42,670 --> 00:32:45,088
...the bravest humans ever to live...

456
00:32:45,256 --> 00:32:47,884
...led by the remarkable Dr. Mann.

457
00:32:48,384 --> 00:32:51,386
Each person's landing pod
had enough life support for two years.

458
00:32:51,554 --> 00:32:53,513
But they could use hibernation
to stretch that...

459
00:32:53,681 --> 00:32:56,893
...making observations on organics
over a decade or more.

460
00:32:57,058 --> 00:33:00,896
Their mission was to assess their world,
and if it showed potential...

461
00:33:01,230 --> 00:33:05,651
...then they could send out a signal,
bed down for the long nap, wait to be rescued.

462
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:07,862
And what if the world didn't show promise?

463
00:33:08,488 --> 00:33:09,905
Hence the bravery.

464
00:33:10,698 --> 00:33:13,241
You don't have the resources
to visit all 12.

465
00:33:13,409 --> 00:33:14,535
No.

466
00:33:15,411 --> 00:33:18,205
Data transmission back through
the Wormhole is rudimentary.

467
00:33:18,372 --> 00:33:23,419
Simple binary pings on an annual basis give us
some clue as to which worlds have potential.

468
00:33:23,586 --> 00:33:25,378
And one system shows promise.

469
00:33:25,712 --> 00:33:28,257
One. That's a bit of a long shot, isn't it?

470
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:31,928
One system with three potential worlds?

471
00:33:32,345 --> 00:33:33,930
No long shot.

472
00:33:36,097 --> 00:33:37,224
Okay.

473
00:33:37,933 --> 00:33:40,269
So if we find a home...

474
00:33:42,939 --> 00:33:46,400
...then what?
-That's the long shot.

475
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:49,945
There's a Plan A and a Plan B.

476
00:33:50,445 --> 00:33:53,406
Did you notice anything strange
about the launch chamber?

477
00:34:05,126 --> 00:34:08,047
COOPER:
This entire facility's a centrifuge.

478
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:10,882
Some kind of vehicle. A space station?

Both. Plan A.

480
00:34:13,135 --> 00:34:15,221
How do you get it off the ground?

481
00:34:15,387 --> 00:34:19,057
The first gravitational anomalies
changed everything.

482
00:34:19,391 --> 00:34:23,728
Suddenly we knew
that harnessing gravity was real.

483
00:34:24,063 --> 00:34:28,733
So I started working on a theory
and we started building this station.

484
00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:31,195
But you haven't solved it yet.

485
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,822
That's why there's Plan B.

486
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:39,036
The problem is gravity. How to get
a viable amount of human life off the planet.

487
00:34:39,202 --> 00:34:40,496
This is one way.

488
00:34:40,829 --> 00:34:43,331
Plan B: a population bomb.

489
00:34:43,666 --> 00:34:48,420
Over 5,000 fertilized eggs
weighing in at just under 900 kilos.

490
00:34:49,130 --> 00:34:50,630
How would you raise them?

491
00:34:50,797 --> 00:34:53,259
With equipment on board,
we incubate the first 10.

492
00:34:53,425 --> 00:34:57,304
After that, with surrogacy,
the growth becomes exponential.

493
00:34:58,014 --> 00:35:01,309
Within 30 years,
we could have a colony of hundreds.

494
00:35:01,474 --> 00:35:04,853
The real difficulty with colonization
is genetic diversity.

495
00:35:05,478 --> 00:35:07,023
This takes care of that.

496
00:35:07,188 --> 00:35:09,650
But what about the people here? You just...

497
00:35:10,025 --> 00:35:11,360
...give up on them?

498
00:35:11,985 --> 00:35:13,237
My kids?

499
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:17,115
That's why Plan A is a lot more fun.

-Almost there.

00:36:26,309 --> 00:36:28,771
No, that does not make it wrong.

516
00:36:28,938 --> 00:36:30,063
It might.

517
00:36:30,438 --> 00:36:33,567
Don't trust the right thing
done for the wrong reason.

518
00:36:34,318 --> 00:36:36,653
The why of the thing, that's the foundation.

519
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:38,905
And the foundation's solid.

520
00:36:42,076 --> 00:36:47,081
We farmers, we sit here every year
when the rains fail and we say:

521
00:36:47,373 --> 00:36:48,623
"Next year."

522
00:36:49,291 --> 00:36:52,961
Well, next year ain't gonna save us,
nor the one after that.

523
00:36:53,795 --> 00:36:57,925
This world's a treasure, Donald,
but it's been telling us to leave for a while now.

524
00:37:02,637 --> 00:37:06,434
Mankind was born on Earth,
it was never meant to die here.

525
00:37:09,561 --> 00:37:12,773
Torn will be all right,
but you got to make things right with Murph.

526
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:13,983
I Will.

527
00:37:14,942 --> 00:37:18,112
Without making promises
you don't know you can keep.

528
00:37:28,748 --> 00:37:30,750
You have to talk to me, Murph.

529
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:35,378
I need to fix this before I go.

530
00:37:35,545 --> 00:37:38,423
MURPH:
Then I'll keep it broken so you have to stay.

531
00:37:40,009 --> 00:37:45,014
After you kids came along, your mom said
something to me I never quite understood.

532
00:37:45,389 --> 00:37:47,016
She said, "Now...

533
00:37:48,893 --> 00:37:53,396
...we're just here
to be memories for our kids."

534
00:37:58,527 --> 00:38:01,030
And I think that now I understand
what she meant.

535
00:38:04,784 --> 00:38:08,536
Once you're a parent,
you're the ghost of your children's future.

536
00:38:10,164 --> 00:38:12,333
You said ghosts didn't exist.

537
00:38:18,797 --> 00:38:20,298
That's right, Murph.

538
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:24,844
Murph, look at me.

539
00:38:27,889 --> 00:38:30,391
I can't be your ghost right now.

540
00:38:32,186 --> 00:38:34,188
I need to exist.

541
00:38:35,815 --> 00:38:37,733
They chose me.

542
00:38:38,442 --> 00:38:42,403
Murph, they chose me. You saw.
You're the one who led me to them.

543
00:38:45,032 --> 00:38:47,534
That's exactly why you can't go.

544
00:38:50,746 --> 00:38:52,706
I figured out the message.

545
00:38:53,123 --> 00:38:56,335
- One word. Know what it is?
-Murph.

546
00:38:56,501 --> 00:38:57,836
"Stay. II

547
00:38:58,211 --> 00:39:01,090
- It says, "Stay," Dad.
-Murph.

548
00:39:02,048 --> 00:39:03,509
You don't believe me.

549
00:39:03,675 --> 00:39:06,469
Look at the books! Look at this.
It says, "Stay."

550
00:39:06,637 --> 00:39:09,597
Why--? You're not listening! It says, "Stay!"

551
00:39:09,931 --> 00:39:11,766
No, I'm coming back.

552
00:39:11,934 --> 00:39:13,268
<i>When'?</i>

553
00:39:26,282 --> 00:39:28,742
One for you, one for me.

554
00:39:29,117 --> 00:39:32,288
When I'm up there in hypersleep, or...

555
00:39:32,621 --> 00:39:35,164
...traveling near the speed of light, or...

556
00:39:36,166 --> 00:39:38,293
...near a black hole...

557
00:39:38,751 --> 00:39:43,298
...time's gonna change for me.
It's gonna run more slowly.

558
00:39:44,884 --> 00:39:46,677
When we get back...

559
00:39:47,802 --> 00:39:49,221
...we're gonna compare.

560
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:52,016
MURPH: Time will run differently for us?
-Yeah.

561
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:57,771
By the time I get back,
we might even be the same age, you and me.

562
00:39:58,146 --> 00:40:00,481
"What?" Imagine that!

563
00:40:05,028 --> 00:40:06,195
Aw, Murph...

564
00:40:06,362 --> 00:40:08,990
You have no idea when you're coming back.

565
00:40:10,784 --> 00:40:12,286
No idea at all!

566
00:40:15,414 --> 00:40:17,541
Murph, don't-- Don't make me leave like this.

567
00:40:17,708 --> 00:40:19,208
Come on, Murph!

568
00:40:19,710 --> 00:40:22,045
Don't make me leave like this, Murph!

569
00:40:29,637 --> 00:40:30,679

570
00:40:31,221 --> 00:40:32,556

Forever. You hear me?

572
00:40:35,309 --> 00:40:38,519
I love you forever, and I'm coming back.

573
00:40:44,318 --> 00:40:45,652
I'm coming back.

574
00:41:03,878 --> 00:41:06,047
- How'd it go?
-Fine.

575
00:41:06,798 --> 00:41:08,257
Just fine.

576
00:41:14,722 --> 00:41:15,849
I love you, Tom.

00:41:16,391 --> 00:41:18,518

-Yeah.

578
00:41:18,686 --> 00:41:20,938
You look after our place for me, all right?

579
00:41:21,105 --> 00:41:22,731
- All right?
-Uh-huh.

580
00:41:27,235 --> 00:41:30,614
- Hey, can I use your truck while you're gone?
-You mean your truck?

581
00:41:32,115 --> 00:41:33,742
I'll make sure they bring it back.

582
00:41:35,869 --> 00:41:37,663

TARS: I have a cue light I can use
when I'm joking if you like.

604
00:43:04,791 --> 00:43:05,833
That'd probably help.

605

to the ship after I blow you out the airlock.

- What's your humor setting, TARS?
-That's 100 percent.

- We should learn to talk.
-And when not to.

Just being honest.

00:44:24,413 --> 00:44:26,748
I don't think you need to be that honest.

Hey, TARS, what's your honesty parameter?

625
00:44:29,751 --> 00:44:32,378
TARS: Ninety percent.
-Ninety percent?

626
00:44:32,545 --> 00:44:35,590
Absolute honesty isn't always
the most diplomatic, nor the...

627
00:44:35,757 --> 00:44:38,342
...safest form of communication
with emotional beings.

Okay.

1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,074


2
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:16,201
"If anyone finds this...

3
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:22,207
it means that my plan didn't work...

4
00:01:22,457 --> 00:01:25,168
and I'm already dead.

5
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:30,841
But, if I can somehow go back...

6
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:35,429
to the beginning of all of this,
I might be able...

7
00:01:37,222 --> 00:01:39,850
to save her."

8
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:29,691
Evan!

9
00:02:34,029 --> 00:02:36,198
We're gonna be late again.

10
00:02:36,448 --> 00:02:38,784
Since when do you care
about getting to school on time?

11
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:41,411
They're putting up the pictures
for Parents' Night.

12
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:43,955
Don't worry.
We have plenty of time.

13
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:49,836
- Is dad gonna come?
- You know the answer to that.

14
00:02:50,087 --> 00:02:52,464
Can't he just
come out for one day?

15
00:02:52,589 --> 00:02:56,093
We've been over this a hundred times.
It's too dangerous for him.

16
00:02:56,301 --> 00:03:00,430
But Lenny said his dad's coming.
And Tommy and Kayleigh's dad.

17
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:02,599
Okay, I get the point.

18
00:03:03,558 --> 00:03:06,812
- But I'm not so bad, am I?
- No.

19
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:25,622
Okay. Have a great day.
I love you. I'll pick you up later.

20
00:03:27,082 --> 00:03:28,500
I gotta go.

21
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:33,588
Bye!

22
00:03:36,133 --> 00:03:40,220
- Mrs. Treborn, I need to talk to you.
- Can it be at night? I'm late for work.

23
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:42,973
I think you really
need to see this.

24
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:49,396
Tommy! Leave Lenny alone.
Don't make me send you to Mr. Voytek.

25
00:03:50,856 --> 00:03:54,526
I was gonna show to the principal,
but I should talk to you first.

26
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:57,237
- What is it?
- Yesterday I had all the children...

27
00:03:57,404 --> 00:03:59,614
make drawings about what they
wanted to be when they grew up.

28
00:03:59,781 --> 00:04:02,367
Most of them made drawings of
what their parents did, but this...

29
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:17,966
I don't understand.
Evan did this?

30
00:04:20,135 --> 00:04:22,512
- Can I keep this drawing?
- Of course.

31
00:04:23,638 --> 00:04:26,641
There is one more thing, Mrs. Treborn.
I feel bad even mentioning.

32
00:04:26,892 --> 00:04:30,520
- What?
- When I asked about the drawing...

33
00:04:30,729 --> 00:04:34,733
well... he couldn't
remember doing it.

34
00:04:42,491 --> 00:04:45,160
I don't wanna go!

35
00:04:46,036 --> 00:04:50,415
I don't like this place, Mom.
It's creepy.

36
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:55,921
- I promise I won't make a bad picture.
- You're gonna be fine, okay?

37
00:04:56,129 --> 00:05:00,675
He just wants to do a couple of tests,
that's all. You'll like him.

38
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:06,932
That's good.
You're doing great.

39
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:10,560
Just tell me he hasn't
inherited his father's illness.

40
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:13,271
Result will be negative.

41
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:15,524
But there's something else
you can do to monitor his memory.

42
00:05:16,066 --> 00:05:18,193
- Anything.
- A journal.

43
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:21,905
- Have him write everything he does.
- What will that do?

44
00:05:22,072 --> 00:05:27,077
It could help to jog his memory.
He can remember new things after.

45
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:30,080
The results will come back in a few
days, and we'll take it from there.

46
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:31,081
Okay.

47
00:05:31,706 --> 00:05:35,585
Today Mommy is taking me
to play with Kayleigh and Tommy.

48
00:05:35,794 --> 00:05:39,589
I'll meet their father and see
what a real dad is like.

49
00:05:41,716 --> 00:05:43,927
Great.
See you soon.

50
00:05:55,939 --> 00:05:58,692
Evan?
Evan.

51
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:02,612
What are you doing
with that knife?

52
00:06:09,119 --> 00:06:11,329
What happened?

53
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:13,373
Honey...

54
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:17,377
what were you doing
with that knife?

55
00:06:18,128 --> 00:06:21,131
I don't remember.

56
00:06:31,141 --> 00:06:33,476
- Hey, Andrea.
- George.

57
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:36,271
Hello, little man.

58
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:39,149
Watch your step.

59
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:44,738
- Thanks, George.
- Not a problem.

60
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:48,033
Here's my number at the hospital,
in case there are any problems.

61
00:06:48,283 --> 00:06:51,911
And, please,
keep an eye on him, 'cause...

62
00:06:52,162 --> 00:06:54,873
Are you kidding? We're gonna have
a great time today, right, Sport?

63
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:57,792
Okay.
Be good, kiddo.

64
00:06:58,001 --> 00:06:59,169
- I love you.
- Bye-bye.

65
00:06:59,377 --> 00:07:01,546
Bye, George.

66
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:05,258
Go long, go on. Right in the
back yard. Here it comes!

67
00:07:08,178 --> 00:07:12,390
Guess what? Dad got a new video
camera, we're all gonna be in a movie!

68
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:17,562
That's right, Evan.
And you'll get to be the star.

69
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:20,899
- I thought I was the star!
- Hey, what did I tell you?

70
00:07:23,026 --> 00:07:26,321
Now, Evan, you have to promise...

71
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:32,911
your bestest super-duper promise
that this is gonna be our little secret.

72
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:37,290
Think you can do that?

73
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:49,678
- Where am I? Where did all go?
- Calm down, kid. Stand still.

74
00:07:49,928 --> 00:07:53,598
I was just somewhere else!
How did I get here?

75
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:59,229
Quit act like a retard or I'll call
your mom to tell a shit you've been.

76
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:05,610
Kayleigh. Kayleigh.

77
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:09,572
What happened?

78
00:08:18,248 --> 00:08:20,875
The good news is
the results are negative.

79
00:08:21,126 --> 00:08:24,254
I found no evidence of lesions,
hemorrhaging, tumors.

80
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:27,882
- It must have something we can go on.
- Lf I was to guess...

81
00:08:28,091 --> 00:08:32,137
...the blackouts are stress related.
- But he's 7 years old.

82
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:34,556
What kind of stress can he have?

83
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:38,685
Plenty. Maybe he has severe coping
problems about not having a father.

84
00:08:39,561 --> 00:08:43,398
The last time the blackouts occurred
was visiting his friend's dad?

85
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:50,655
Well, he has been pushing me to meet
his father and I've putting it off.

86
00:08:51,072 --> 00:08:54,659
It's worth a short, Andrea.
We can arrange a controlled meeting.

87
00:08:55,035 --> 00:08:58,163
A careful dose of sedatives
for Jason, some security.

88
00:08:58,455 --> 00:09:01,666
Evan comes in for a guick
visit and, with a little luck...

89
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:04,961
no more missing father complex.

90
00:09:08,465 --> 00:09:10,467
April, 1 5th.

91
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:14,220
Today I get to meet my father.
His name is Jason...

92
00:09:14,429 --> 00:09:17,932
and he's crazy.
I hope he lets me call him Dad.

93
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:25,482
- My dad lives here?
- Not in this wing, actually no.

94
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:29,694
If your dad seems a little sleepy,
that's because of the medicine, okay?

95
00:09:29,861 --> 00:09:30,612
Okay.

96
00:09:33,448 --> 00:09:35,992
It'll just be a moment, okay.

97
00:10:06,648 --> 00:10:08,900
It's okay, I won't bite.

98
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,737
You've seen pictures of me, right?

99
00:10:13,404 --> 00:10:18,034
Mom says I have your smile
and your hair and your...

100
00:10:24,415 --> 00:10:26,501
He has to die!
It's the only way!

101
00:10:26,668 --> 00:10:29,546
Jason, stop! No!

102
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:36,886
- It's gonna be okay. All right.
- Man, he's hurt bad.

103
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:39,639
Get a stretcher!

104
00:10:40,265 --> 00:10:41,307
Come on, let's get him outta here.

105
00:10:41,808 --> 00:10:46,563
In sure and certain hope of
the resurrection to eternal life...

106
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:50,191
we commend to the Almighty God
our brother Jason.

107
00:10:50,441 --> 00:10:53,778
The Lord bless him and keep him.
The Lord make His face...

108
00:10:53,945 --> 00:10:57,574
to shine upon him and
be gracious unto him...

109
00:10:57,782 --> 00:11:01,202
and give him peace.
Amen.

110
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:43,119
Come on, where is it?
I know it's down here somewhere.

111
00:11:43,328 --> 00:11:46,998
- Tommy, I'm bored. What's up?
- Yeah, what are you looking for?

112
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:53,004
Shut up lard ass. And you, hold your
fucking horses. It's here somewhere.

113
00:11:53,504 --> 00:11:55,840
We should go soon.

114
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:58,134
If dad catches us smoking
down here, we're dead.

115
00:11:58,635 --> 00:12:00,511
So, let's go.

116
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:07,518
I knew dad had a blockbuster here.
Lets blow the shit outta something!

117
00:12:17,654 --> 00:12:19,989
Here you go, buddy.

118
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:24,118
- No way. I'm not touching this thing.
- The hell you aren't.

119
00:12:24,369 --> 00:12:26,537
If we do it, you'll puss
out and narc for sure.

120
00:12:26,788 --> 00:12:30,667
Ain't not gonna work this time.
Look how small this fuse is.

121
00:12:30,917 --> 00:12:33,294
- I'll get killed.
- Not necessarily.

122
00:12:36,047 --> 00:12:39,425
Here you go. It should
buy you 2 minutes at least.

123
00:12:40,385 --> 00:12:42,762
Gee, thanks, friend.

124
00:12:51,145 --> 00:12:53,690
For Christ sake, Lenny,
you moron. Just do it.

125
00:13:05,702 --> 00:13:07,203
Thanks.

126
00:13:07,412 --> 00:13:10,540
- You got balls, man.
- Sure took long enough.

127
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:40,611
What the hell!
Come on!

128
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,613
Evan, help me get him up!

129
00:13:42,739 --> 00:13:46,492
- Get you ass back here and help me!
- What happened? Where are we?

130
00:13:46,743 --> 00:13:50,496
- Oh my God, what did we do?
- Evan, come on, help me!

131
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:54,500
- Oh my God, how could we?
- Come on, let's go!

132
00:13:54,751 --> 00:13:57,587
- Shit, what happened to you?
- He's fine, he's gonna be okay!

133
00:13:57,754 --> 00:13:59,589
Everything is gonna be fine!

134
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:03,634
- What's wrong, why isn't he speaking?
- He's in shock, ma'am.

135
00:14:04,135 --> 00:14:06,220
Lenny, how many
fingers am I holding up?

136
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:10,266
What is it?
What happened?

137
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:13,144
We were just in the woods building
a fort when Lenny freaked out.

138
00:14:13,603 --> 00:14:16,898
One minute he was okay,
then he just froze up. Right, guys?

139
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:21,402
- What happened? I want the truth.
- I don't know. I don't remember.

140
00:14:21,778 --> 00:14:23,905
Something must've happened!
Something set him off!

141
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:30,745
- I blacked out.
- Don't use the blackouts to get out.

142
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:39,420
You're not making it up?

143
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:47,512
Breathe in...

144
00:14:47,762 --> 00:14:50,640
breathe out... and relax.

145
00:14:51,057 --> 00:14:55,561
You are completely
asleep and relaxed.

146
00:14:56,562 --> 00:15:00,775
I want you to take me to the time
you were in the woods with Lenny.

147
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:03,444
Think of it like a movie:

148
00:15:03,694 --> 00:15:10,326
You can pause, rewind or
slow down any details you wish.

149
00:15:10,535 --> 00:15:14,455
- Understand?
- Yes.

150
00:15:15,206 --> 00:15:17,708
Where are you now?

151
00:15:18,835 --> 00:15:22,588
I'm standing next to Kayleigh.
My hands are over her ears.

152
00:15:22,797 --> 00:15:27,844
- Are you hurting her?
- No. I'm protecting her.

153
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:33,850
Okay. Now let's move forward
in time. What do you see?

154
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:39,605
I see a car.

155
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:44,610
Yes, Evan.
Tell me about the car.

156
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:49,490
Go on.
Nothing can hurt you.

157
00:15:50,575 --> 00:15:55,079
Remember? It's only a movie.
You are completely safe.

158
00:15:55,246 --> 00:15:57,248
I can't...

159
00:15:57,373 --> 00:16:00,751
The car vanishes, all of a sudden,
I'm on the ground in the woods.

160
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:06,007
The car doesn't vanish, Evan.
The movie in your head is broken.

161
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:08,134
Now, tell me about the car.

162
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:10,511
I can't!
It's coming!

163
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:15,850
Fight it, Evan.
Hurry! It's coming!

164
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:19,896
- Oh, my God!
- On the count of 1 0 you'll wake up.

165
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,274
- Refreshed, remembering everything.
- What are you doing?

166
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:25,401
What is happening to him?
Make it stop!

167
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:29,363
1 , you are feeling awake.
2, your eyes are not that heavy.

168
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:30,615
5, 6...

169
00:16:30,907 --> 00:16:33,367
- Come on, Evan, wake up! 9, 1 0!
- Wake him up!

170
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,997
Oh, God.

171
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:44,420
What happened?
Did it work?

172
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:54,180
Thanks, mom.
See you later.

173
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:06,025
Wipe that sad-ass look off your
face before you get us busted!

174
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:10,655
- See the way Evan's mom look at you?
- Sorry.

175
00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:18,538
All right, someone can tell me what
the hell happened with the mailbox?

176
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:25,294
Don't ever bring this up again.
Not ever!

177
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:32,677
Let's go.

178
00:17:35,805 --> 00:17:38,766
Are you okay?

179
00:17:51,529 --> 00:17:57,326
Holy shit! Look that fat fuck! He's
got bigger titties than Lenny's mom!

180
00:17:58,452 --> 00:18:02,164
Shut up, faggot.
No one is talking to you.

181
00:18:26,731 --> 00:18:29,734
Sorry, Kayleigh.
This was a bad idea.

182
00:18:29,984 --> 00:18:33,237
You really don't remember
anything that happened?

183
00:18:34,447 --> 00:18:37,616
- You're so lucky.
- Look, everything is gonna be okay.

184
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:39,869
Lenny'll be fine.
You'll see.

185
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:45,374
- Sorry.
- It's not your fault.

186
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:48,127
Mrs. Kagan called dad and blamed
us for what happened to Lenny.

187
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:52,715
- Your dad did that?
- I deserve a lot worse.

188
00:18:52,882 --> 00:18:55,968
What are you talking about? What you
deserve is better father and brother.

189
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:58,596
All they do is make
you feel like shit!

190
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:05,770
You really have no clue how
beautiful you are, do you?

191
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:20,117
- What the fuck are you doing?
- Buying popcorn. You?

192
00:19:20,534 --> 00:19:24,789
- Whoops.
- I don't believe you did that!

193
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:28,876
- Why do you have to be such a dick?
- I don't know.

194
00:19:31,379 --> 00:19:34,298
- You see how far he went.
- I don't believe.

195
00:19:39,512 --> 00:19:42,515
Stop it!
Stop hitting him!

196
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:45,935
What's wrong with you?

197
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:51,941
- Somebody please help us!
- That's it, kid. You're outta here.

198
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:59,198
Get him away!
Get him away!

199
00:19:59,949 --> 00:20:04,203
The peaceful town of Briarville
was rocked this afternoon...

200
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:06,956
in the wake of a horrible
act of vandalism.

201
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:12,712
While the police believe it was an
act of criminal mischief gone awry...

202
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:16,090
the tragedy has clearly
devastated the community.

203
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:19,218
Now this was the grisly aftermath
of as powerful explosion...

204
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:23,097
believed to have been caused by
an unknown guantity of dynamite.

205
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:27,184
Police has no leads,
no suspects and no motive for the...

206
00:20:44,994 --> 00:20:47,204
Good night.

207
00:20:56,589 --> 00:20:58,883
We're moving.

208
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:21,030
I can't believe Tommy's still pissed
at me. He knows I'm moving away?

209
00:21:21,238 --> 00:21:26,285
He's been acting real strange lately.
He won't even look at me in the eyes.

210
00:21:26,744 --> 00:21:29,288
Duck, here they come!

211
00:21:33,751 --> 00:21:36,545
Did your mom say
if Lenny was okay?

212
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:42,885
He must be. I mean,
they're letting him out, right?

213
00:22:06,534 --> 00:22:09,286
Welcome home. I thought you might
like some fresh air for a change.

214
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:14,291
- Is Tommy with you guys?
- No. It's cool.

215
00:22:24,301 --> 00:22:26,595
So, what'd you do in there?

216
00:22:26,804 --> 00:22:31,934
It was awful. You can't sleep 'cause
everybody is screaming all night.

217
00:22:32,476 --> 00:22:34,854
I never want to go back.

218
00:22:35,062 --> 00:22:38,941
- Do you see that?
- Yeah. What's up with the smoke?

219
00:23:01,755 --> 00:23:05,342
Crockett!
What are you doing to my dog?

220
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:13,100
- Look what you make me do!
- What the hell's wrong with you?

221
00:23:28,115 --> 00:23:33,996
Kayleigh! My God!
Come on! Please, wake up!

222
00:23:34,872 --> 00:23:36,916
Why don't you fucking kiss her,
Prince Charming?

223
00:23:52,932 --> 00:23:55,184
How long I was out?

224
00:23:57,561 --> 00:24:00,189
Kayleigh, what's wrong?

225
00:24:57,955 --> 00:25:00,749
I'm sorry.

226
00:25:28,277 --> 00:25:31,613
- Aced it.
- And time! Put your pencils down.

227
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:35,617
And place your blue books on
my desk before you leave.

228
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:38,662
You too, Mr. Nelson.
We're all in the same time zone here.

229
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:40,873
- Fuck you!
- So, how'd you do, Evan?

230
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:44,668
I don't know. I might've
mixed up some of the stories.

231
00:25:44,918 --> 00:25:47,504
Was it Pavlov that conditioned
his dog to lick his nuts?

232
00:25:49,673 --> 00:25:52,551
Typical psych major:
A complete wise ass.

233
00:25:52,801 --> 00:25:55,012
How's your project coming?
Still planning...

234
00:25:55,179 --> 00:25:58,557
to change the way we humble
scientists view memory assimilation?

235
00:25:58,807 --> 00:26:01,810
I don't really have a choice.

236
00:26:30,339 --> 00:26:32,841
Oh, jeez. It smells like patchouli
and ass in here.

237
00:26:33,091 --> 00:26:36,220
Cricket, this is my well-mannered
roommate, Evan.

238
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:38,680
Yeah.

239
00:26:38,847 --> 00:26:43,060
You're the one that fucked up the
bell curve on my anthropology final.

240
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:46,605
- Bye.
- Fucking dick.

241
00:26:47,564 --> 00:26:49,358
- Oh! Sweet girl, man.
- Found your shirt, bro.

242
00:26:50,859 --> 00:26:52,486
You sick fuck.

243
00:26:53,946 --> 00:26:57,616
All right man, get dressed.
You're taking me out.

244
00:26:57,825 --> 00:27:01,745
- Why? Aced another midterm?
- No.

245
00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:07,000
Better than that.
Seven years, no blackouts.

246
00:27:07,751 --> 00:27:10,337
Fuck yeah, bro.
Let's do this! Come on!

247
00:27:13,006 --> 00:27:15,467
Be gentle to me!
I'm post-coital!

248
00:27:15,717 --> 00:27:18,011
Did she cradle the balls
and lick the shaft?

249
00:27:23,392 --> 00:27:25,352
Nice.

250
00:27:26,603 --> 00:27:28,522
Look at this fucking guy.

251
00:27:30,148 --> 00:27:31,400
Get the fuck out of my bar.

252
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:34,653
Which one of you
has the pet worm?

253
00:27:34,862 --> 00:27:39,741
- Worms. Plural.
- That's so gross.

254
00:27:40,409 --> 00:27:43,036
Talk to him about it.
He's got the fetish.

255
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:48,167
Watch it. It's a psych project.
It's a study on memory loss.

256
00:27:48,375 --> 00:27:50,794
Better explain before all this
excitement gives me a heart attack.

257
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:57,134
- Ten bucks he eats it off the floor.
- Well...

258
00:27:58,135 --> 00:28:01,805
if I could figure out how the
memories of a simple worm function...

259
00:28:02,014 --> 00:28:04,057
it should help me to
understand the complexities...

260
00:28:05,934 --> 00:28:08,312
of the human brain.

261
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:12,316
Let me get this shot.

262
00:28:18,322 --> 00:28:20,949
- What the fuck, weirdo?
- The fuck is this?

263
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:31,585
Well, I guess that's your game.

264
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:45,849
Smells like sex in here.

265
00:28:46,475 --> 00:28:49,937
Yeah, Thumper had
a busy afternoon.

266
00:28:50,103 --> 00:28:53,607
You're kidding.
He's so big.

267
00:28:54,107 --> 00:28:59,488
Yeah? Well, I guess charisma
and eyeliner go a long way.

268
00:29:00,489 --> 00:29:03,075
- You want a beer?
- Yeah.

269
00:29:05,369 --> 00:29:08,705
You got any incense or
scented candles or something?

270
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:17,381
No. These are my...

271
00:29:17,631 --> 00:29:21,260
Most guys tuck porn under their bed.
All you've got are comp books?

272
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:25,389
They're my journals.
I've been keeping them since I was 7.

273
00:29:25,973 --> 00:29:28,517
Wow.

274
00:29:29,893 --> 00:29:32,521
Read me something.

275
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:37,109
I ought to be getting something out
of this. That's all I got to say.

276
00:29:41,738 --> 00:29:46,118
"It's like my mind refuses
to believe what I'm seeing.

277
00:29:50,247 --> 00:29:54,668
Hearing Crockett make
those awful screams.

278
00:30:00,007 --> 00:30:04,761
Just writing about it
gives me the shivers."

279
00:30:05,512 --> 00:30:09,057
Come on. Go on.

280
00:30:12,185 --> 00:30:16,440
"It was like Tommy was
possessed or something.

281
00:30:17,316 --> 00:30:19,943
There was a hate
in his eyes that..."

282
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:28,035
Are you okay?

283
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:37,461
Where am I?

284
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:40,339
What the hell is going on?

285
00:30:51,224 --> 00:30:53,977
- I can't get it open!
- Drop it...

286
00:30:54,811 --> 00:30:56,855
or I'll slit your mother's
throat in her sleep.

287
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:04,488
I got him, Lenny!
Save Crockett!

288
00:31:12,746 --> 00:31:14,831
Listen to me, Evan.
Listen to me good.

289
00:31:15,332 --> 00:31:18,126
There's a million other sisters.
Why'd you have to fuck with mine?

290
00:31:23,757 --> 00:31:27,260
It's okay.
It was just a dream.

291
00:31:29,638 --> 00:31:33,767
- Didn't feel like a dream.
- Maybe because they never do.

292
00:31:34,768 --> 00:31:38,021
So, Don Juan, you pass
out on all your dates?

293
00:32:14,266 --> 00:32:18,645
Lenny? I've got a surprise for you.
You'll never gonna guess who's here.

294
00:32:18,812 --> 00:32:22,816
It's me. Evan.

295
00:32:58,852 --> 00:33:01,605
What are you working
on there? A model?

296
00:33:04,608 --> 00:33:10,238
Look, I see that you're busy,
so I'll try to make this guick.

297
00:33:10,739 --> 00:33:16,703
You remember that day at the
junkyard when we were kids?

298
00:33:17,704 --> 00:33:21,249
I was just hoping you
could help me remember...

299
00:33:24,503 --> 00:33:28,089
just any details about it, or...

300
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:34,471
- I couldn't cut the rope.
- Yeah.

301
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:38,099
That's good.

302
00:33:39,476 --> 00:33:42,145
Anything else?

303
00:33:44,648 --> 00:33:48,276
"Drop it or I'll slit your
mother's throat in her sleep!"

304
00:33:57,661 --> 00:34:00,789
Jesus Christ.

305
00:34:02,374 --> 00:34:05,168
It really happened.

306
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:09,798
Lenny, I...

307
00:34:12,592 --> 00:34:19,099
"Make one peep and I swear
it'll be your last, motherfucker!"

308
00:34:52,882 --> 00:34:57,387
"What I remember before the blackout
was hold my hands over her ears.

309
00:34:57,637 --> 00:35:03,893
I think I was more focused on her
hands on mine than on the mailbox...

310
00:35:04,602 --> 00:35:07,022
...across the street."

311
00:35:19,659 --> 00:35:23,163
- Maybe it went out. Should we check?
- Yeah. You do that, Lenny.

312
00:35:32,922 --> 00:35:34,924
Make one peep and I swear
it'll be your last, motherfucker.

313
00:35:58,698 --> 00:36:01,034
How's my sweet girl?

314
00:36:01,201 --> 00:36:05,205
How's my sweet girl? You need
a change, don't you honey?

315
00:36:05,789 --> 00:36:08,708
You want to open it?
You open?

316
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:15,673
- My God!
- Holy shit! Run!

317
00:36:15,965 --> 00:36:18,093
Fuck, Lenny! Come on!

318
00:36:18,593 --> 00:36:22,472
- Lenny, come on!
- Come on, Lenny! Let's go!

319
00:36:38,071 --> 00:36:42,200
Christ, man, fucking brutal.

320
00:36:48,706 --> 00:36:51,334
- Hello.
- Hello? Who is this?

321
00:36:51,501 --> 00:36:54,754
Mrs. Kagan, it's Evan Treborn.

322
00:36:54,963 --> 00:36:57,632
I hope you know
how much you upset Lenny.

323
00:36:57,882 --> 00:37:01,511
Yeah. I'm really
sorry about that.

324
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:04,347
It took me over an hour to
clean up the mess you made.

325
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:09,018
- Can I just talk to Lenny?
- Don't call here.

326
00:37:16,151 --> 00:37:18,236
Mom!

327
00:37:19,362 --> 00:37:21,531
I can't help it.
I'm so proud of you.

328
00:37:23,867 --> 00:37:26,995
Did Da... Did Jason
get good grades?

329
00:37:27,162 --> 00:37:33,418
He got "A"s without touching a book.
This area of his memory never failed.

330
00:37:33,668 --> 00:37:39,632
Did he ever say that he, figured out
a way to recall his lost memories...

331
00:37:39,799 --> 00:37:42,927
years after he blacked them
out in the first place?

332
00:37:43,178 --> 00:37:48,057
- Why do you ask?
- I just figured he was a brain...

333
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:52,437
you'd think that he'd figure out a
way to remember stuff that he forgot.

334
00:37:53,563 --> 00:37:57,942
When he was your age, almost exactly
your age come to think of it...

335
00:37:58,693 --> 00:38:01,905
he said he figured out
a way to remember his past.

336
00:38:02,197 --> 00:38:05,283
I couldn't tell if they were real
memories or just his imagination.

337
00:38:06,075 --> 00:38:11,206
Then, just before
it got so bad...

338
00:38:11,789 --> 00:38:16,961
he had to be institutionalized,
he said he could...

339
00:38:18,421 --> 00:38:20,590
What?

340
00:38:24,469 --> 00:38:28,973
- What did he do?
- Forget it. It's nothing.

341
00:38:29,474 --> 00:38:32,727
He was far too sick by then.

342
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:45,240
"I never wanted to be
in the movie anyway.

343
00:38:45,615 --> 00:38:49,244
And it was cold,
so I wanted to wear my clothes.

344
00:38:49,452 --> 00:38:52,622
- Mr. Miller took my shirt off."
- What the fuck are you doing?

345
00:38:53,748 --> 00:38:57,961
- I need guiet for this.
- Are you stupid or what, man?

346
00:38:58,711 --> 00:39:03,842
Maybe there is a reason you repressed
some pervert in your tighty whities.

347
00:39:06,511 --> 00:39:11,140
I'd think twice. You could wake
up more fucked up than now.

348
00:39:11,474 --> 00:39:15,645
More fucked up than I am. You
think you know me? I don't know me.

349
00:39:58,438 --> 00:40:00,815
No, it's my fault.
I'm fine.

350
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:04,027
Can we get through one damn day
without you breaking something?

351
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:38,186
Evan?

352
00:40:40,104 --> 00:40:43,983
Oh, my God,
it's been a long time.

353
00:40:44,984 --> 00:40:47,362
How've you been?

354
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:50,823
- Same old same old, you know.
- No, I don't know.

355
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:53,618
Fill me in.

356
00:40:54,619 --> 00:41:00,375
Well, I'm going to State now.
It's going good. My mom's good.

357
00:41:01,834 --> 00:41:05,338
- Want a smoke?
- No. Not since we were kids.

358
00:41:06,089 --> 00:41:08,633
I've guit, like, a hundred times.

359
00:41:12,261 --> 00:41:15,098
Are you walking home, or...?

360
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:17,892
- Can I walk you?
- Sure.

361
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:23,731
- My God.
- So...

362
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:28,653
how's Tommy?

363
00:41:30,113 --> 00:41:35,994
They kept him in juvy for while. Now
he's working over at Dale's Auto Body.

364
00:41:37,036 --> 00:41:39,539
That's good.

365
00:41:40,623 --> 00:41:47,296
- Still living with your dad?
- No. I emancipated myself at 1 5.

366
00:41:49,382 --> 00:41:54,429
- Must've taken a lot of courage.
- Not if you remember my dad.

367
00:41:57,807 --> 00:42:00,560
Couldn't you have moved in
with your with your mom?

368
00:42:01,436 --> 00:42:06,566
Nah, she had a new family.
Wasn't enough room. Whatever.

369
00:42:07,066 --> 00:42:11,404
Well, look, the reason I came back
to town was to talk to you.

370
00:42:11,571 --> 00:42:14,657
To me?
Why?

371
00:42:15,450 --> 00:42:17,952
Well...

372
00:42:18,703 --> 00:42:22,707
remember when we were kids and
I used to have those blackouts?

373
00:42:23,166 --> 00:42:25,460
Yeah, of course.

374
00:42:25,668 --> 00:42:29,464
Well, some of those memories
have been coming back to me.

375
00:42:30,715 --> 00:42:33,843
And I wanted to talk to you
about one of them in particular.

376
00:42:34,177 --> 00:42:36,721
Well, I'll try to remember.

377
00:42:40,683 --> 00:42:45,104
When we were kids,
your dad was making a movie...

378
00:42:45,313 --> 00:42:50,443
...about Robin Hood or something.
- What do you want to know, Evan?

379
00:42:54,363 --> 00:42:56,199
Did he...?

380
00:42:57,950 --> 00:43:02,997
- What happened in the basement?
- Look, it was a long time ago.

381
00:43:05,083 --> 00:43:09,587
- I know.
- Is that why you came all the way?

382
00:43:09,837 --> 00:43:12,131
To ask a lot of stupid
guestions about Robin Hood?

383
00:43:12,381 --> 00:43:15,134
No.

384
00:43:15,384 --> 00:43:18,846
I just think that something
really bad might've happened.

385
00:43:19,013 --> 00:43:21,891
Is there a point to any of this?

386
00:43:22,892 --> 00:43:24,852
Whatever happened,
it wasn't our fault.

387
00:43:25,394 --> 00:43:28,481
We were kids. There was nothing
that we could do to deserve...

388
00:43:28,981 --> 00:43:32,777
Just shut up, Evan!
You're wasting your breath.

389
00:43:33,277 --> 00:43:35,863
You can't hate yourself because
your dad's a twisted freak.

390
00:43:36,531 --> 00:43:39,242
Who are you trying
to convince, Evan?

391
00:43:39,492 --> 00:43:44,622
You come all the way to stir up my
shit because you have a bad memory?

392
00:43:44,789 --> 00:43:49,252
Should I cry on your shoulder and
tell you everything's all better now?

393
00:43:49,418 --> 00:43:55,133
Fuck you, Evan. Nothing's all better,
okay? Nothing ever gets better.

394
00:43:59,428 --> 00:44:04,142
You know, if I was so wonderful,
Evan, why didn't you call me?

395
00:44:04,308 --> 00:44:07,687
Why did you leave
me here to rot?

396
00:44:23,452 --> 00:44:26,706
When he was your age, almost exactly
your age come to think of it...

397
00:44:26,914 --> 00:44:30,710
he said he figured out
a way to remember his past.

398
00:44:33,713 --> 00:44:38,092
- Some dude left a message for you.
- You can smell from the bathroom.

399
00:44:41,345 --> 00:44:45,224
This is Professor Carter. Why you
didn't hand in your essay today?

400
00:44:45,474 --> 00:44:49,353
I was a bit concerned.
Call me to schedule a makeup.

401
00:44:52,857 --> 00:44:55,443
What'd you say to my sister,
motherfucker?

402
00:44:55,610 --> 00:44:58,738
Last night she cried on the
phone for over an hour to me.

403
00:44:58,988 --> 00:45:02,867
She said you came and
saw her last night. She...

404
00:45:03,701 --> 00:45:06,746
she fucking killed
herself tonight.

405
00:45:06,996 --> 00:45:10,958
She's dead.
And so are you.

406
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:33,457
If the scar on my stomach didn't
just come out of nowhere...

407
00:46:33,666 --> 00:46:37,545
maybe my father wasn't as
crazy as everyone thought.

408
00:46:38,337 --> 00:46:43,092
If I can make scars,
do I have the power to heal them?

409
00:46:44,218 --> 00:46:47,304
What about Kayleigh's scars?

410
00:46:52,059 --> 00:46:54,979
"I never wanted to be
in the movie anyway.

411
00:46:55,438 --> 00:47:00,484
It was cold so I wanted
to wear my clothes...

412
00:47:01,736 --> 00:47:04,363
but Mr. Miller...

413
00:47:04,572 --> 00:47:06,866
took my shirt off."

414
00:47:17,626 --> 00:47:22,465
Let's go down to the basement. It'll
look more like a dungeon down there.

415
00:47:25,092 --> 00:47:28,637
A little light here.

416
00:47:32,141 --> 00:47:35,644
- What I say about keeping that shut?
- But I want to see!

417
00:47:35,853 --> 00:47:39,899
You'll see the back of my fist in two
seconds if you don't do what I tell.

418
00:47:42,401 --> 00:47:44,779
Now, in this part of the story...

419
00:47:45,029 --> 00:47:48,908
Robin Hood has just
married Maid Marian...

420
00:47:49,158 --> 00:47:54,246
and they have to kiss and
stuff like the grownups do.

421
00:47:54,497 --> 00:47:58,376
So take off your
clothes, Kayleigh.

422
00:48:00,044 --> 00:48:02,421
Come on. Just like
when we take a bath.

423
00:48:02,671 --> 00:48:05,007
Don't make a big deal
out of it. You too, Evan.

424
00:48:07,009 --> 00:48:10,763
Come on, let's go. Let's go,
we're making a movie here.

425
00:48:10,930 --> 00:48:13,933
Put your hands on your ears.

426
00:48:15,768 --> 00:48:17,770
What time is it?

427
00:48:17,937 --> 00:48:22,316
It's time for you to do
what I tell you to do.

428
00:48:22,650 --> 00:48:27,405
Wrong answer, fuckbag. This is
the very moment of your reckoning.

429
00:48:27,571 --> 00:48:30,783
In the next 30 seconds, you're
going to open up one of two doors.

430
00:48:30,950 --> 00:48:34,203
The first door will forever
traumatize your own flesh and blood.

431
00:48:34,912 --> 00:48:39,291
What? What's happening?
How are you doing this?

432
00:48:39,458 --> 00:48:43,462
It'll change your daughter
from a beautiful child...

433
00:48:43,712 --> 00:48:47,466
into an empty shell
whose only concept of trust...

434
00:48:47,716 --> 00:48:50,970
was betrayed by her
sick pedophile father.

435
00:48:51,345 --> 00:48:55,474
Ultimately,
it'll lead to her suicide.

436
00:48:55,724 --> 00:48:57,810
- Nice work, daddy.
- Who are you?

437
00:48:57,977 --> 00:49:01,355
Let's just say you're being
closely watched, George.

438
00:49:01,605 --> 00:49:04,608
Your other option is
to treat Kayleigh like...

439
00:49:05,067 --> 00:49:10,573
see, like a loving father treats his
daughter. Sound okay to you, Papa?

440
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:17,371
Listen close then, fuckbag.
You screw this up again...

441
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:21,000
I swear I'll castrate you.

442
00:49:21,709 --> 00:49:24,879
What you need to do is
discipline your son, Tommy...

443
00:49:25,087 --> 00:49:27,882
because the kid
is one sadistic pup.

444
00:49:29,341 --> 00:49:31,886
One last thing.

445
00:49:37,892 --> 00:49:41,145
Don't ever touch me again!

446
00:49:41,770 --> 00:49:44,648
I won't.

447
00:50:04,793 --> 00:50:07,254
Faster!

448
00:50:09,507 --> 00:50:10,799
Crockett!

449
00:50:12,635 --> 00:50:13,761
Kayleigh, I can't
believe you came!

450
00:50:15,888 --> 00:50:16,889
I think you got one.

451
00:50:17,806 --> 00:50:19,308
Check out our new house.

452
00:50:27,816 --> 00:50:30,569
Honey, are you all right?

453
00:50:32,655 --> 00:50:37,451
- My God, Evan, you're bleeding!
- Kayleigh. It's you.

454
00:50:41,205 --> 00:50:43,040
Incredible.

455
00:50:43,207 --> 00:50:46,710
Well, thanks. Go get cleaned
up and come back to bed.

456
00:50:49,672 --> 00:50:52,925
- Where are my clothes?
- Those are your clothes, silly.

457
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:03,978
The bathroom's...?

458
00:51:07,481 --> 00:51:10,859
Hurry up.
I want a guickie before school.

459
00:51:49,648 --> 00:51:51,650
What?

460
00:51:52,526 --> 00:51:54,528
Un-fucking-believable.

461
00:51:56,405 --> 00:51:59,908
I wish I could get as
excited over a nose bleed.

462
00:52:00,492 --> 00:52:04,663
Sorry, I didn't see you.

463
00:52:06,623 --> 00:52:13,047
You're the girl that was with those
assholes throwing popcorn at Thumper.

464
00:52:14,048 --> 00:52:15,549
What?

465
00:52:15,799 --> 00:52:20,804
And your name is Gwen.
I know you.

466
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:25,642
Seriously, Evan, lay off the blow.

467
00:52:38,906 --> 00:52:42,201
Don't freak out when
I ask you this...

468
00:52:42,451 --> 00:52:45,704
but do you remember when
your dad got that video camera?

469
00:52:45,954 --> 00:52:47,915
What's up, man?

470
00:52:48,082 --> 00:52:54,546
I think he had it the first day and
then he gave it away or something.

471
00:52:54,713 --> 00:52:57,925
Why would that freak me out?

472
00:52:58,092 --> 00:53:00,344
I don't know.

473
00:53:00,594 --> 00:53:05,432
- Just being weird.
- You are such a goofus.

474
00:53:07,184 --> 00:53:11,313
- So I'll see you tonight.
- Okay.

475
00:53:31,834 --> 00:53:33,252
- Come on, mom.
- Andrea...

476
00:53:33,502 --> 00:53:35,754
- Evan...
- And Chuck aren't home right now!

477
00:53:36,004 --> 00:53:38,257
You know what to do.

478
00:53:39,007 --> 00:53:44,471
Hey, Mom, it's me.
And hey, Chuck.

479
00:53:44,972 --> 00:53:48,517
I'm just calling to say hi.
Just give me a call back.

480
00:53:52,521 --> 00:53:55,733
Thumper, do you know
what time it is, man?

481
00:53:55,899 --> 00:54:01,405
What's the matter? You lost
your Rolex? Fuck you, frat boy!

482
00:54:04,658 --> 00:54:06,535
Remember, there's only
two more weeks...

483
00:54:06,744 --> 00:54:09,747
until your psych projects are due.

484
00:54:10,038 --> 00:54:14,793
About that essay I missed last week.
We're still okay with the extension?

485
00:54:15,002 --> 00:54:19,506
- And you are...?
- Evan. Treborn.

486
00:54:19,673 --> 00:54:24,762
The answer's no, Mr. Treborn. Please
sit down. The exam is about to begin.

487
00:54:29,308 --> 00:54:34,688
All right, settle down, everyone.
The exam will begin in one minute.

488
00:54:39,193 --> 00:54:43,197
Get off me, asshole.
You guys started that shit.

489
00:54:43,447 --> 00:54:46,074
Evan, you're hysterical.

490
00:54:47,576 --> 00:54:50,704
Did you study for this?

491
00:54:53,332 --> 00:54:58,045
- We'll find out, huh?
- Me neither.

492
00:55:08,972 --> 00:55:12,351
- Holy shit. Are these the answers?
- Damn, Evan keep it on the DL.

493
00:55:21,735 --> 00:55:25,322
I want to do something special
for Kayleigh tomorrow night...

494
00:55:25,989 --> 00:55:30,577
so if I said that I needed some
help from you and the brothers...

495
00:55:31,495 --> 00:55:36,124
I'd say, "Blow me."
Get the pledges to do it.

496
00:55:37,751 --> 00:55:40,379
- Right. The pledges?
- Yeah.

497
00:55:40,629 --> 00:55:43,257
You may begin now!

498
00:56:00,649 --> 00:56:03,527
That was so good.

499
00:56:03,777 --> 00:56:06,655
Oh, my God.

500
00:56:06,864 --> 00:56:09,741
Where'd you learn
those new tricks?

501
00:56:10,993 --> 00:56:15,747
It wasn't weird, was it?

502
00:56:17,165 --> 00:56:21,795
Yeah, if you call
multiple orgasms weird...

503
00:56:33,181 --> 00:56:35,142
Fuck them.

504
00:56:46,570 --> 00:56:50,908
What do you think it is about us...

505
00:56:51,325 --> 00:56:53,660
that makes us so perfect?

506
00:56:55,579 --> 00:56:58,332
I mean...

507
00:56:58,540 --> 00:57:03,920
why did you sneak out to
visit me after I moved away?

508
00:57:04,296 --> 00:57:06,465
Because I missed you.

509
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:11,053
You think my dad could've
stopped me from seeing you?

510
00:57:12,220 --> 00:57:14,973
What's he gonna do?

511
00:57:16,683 --> 00:57:19,978
Oh, my Gosh, my toes are numb.

512
00:57:20,312 --> 00:57:22,856
Do you think that we'll
be together forever?

513
00:57:27,736 --> 00:57:30,489
That is a plan, isn't it?

514
00:57:31,740 --> 00:57:34,701
- Hell or high water?
- Yeah.

515
00:57:35,869 --> 00:57:39,748
That's...
I was just making sure.

516
00:57:42,250 --> 00:57:46,213
Yeah. That's the plan.

517
00:57:54,096 --> 00:57:56,640
All right.

518
00:57:57,516 --> 00:58:01,228
All you rushes, you know
what you have to do for me.

519
00:58:01,395 --> 00:58:05,107
Pledges.
We're pledges, sir.

520
00:58:06,149 --> 00:58:09,027
Brother Evan, sir.

521
00:58:10,737 --> 00:58:13,240
Are you kidding me?

522
00:58:15,534 --> 00:58:17,619
What?
What'd you say to me?

523
00:58:17,786 --> 00:58:20,122
You know what, give me the
Greek alphabet. Give it to me.

524
00:58:21,540 --> 00:58:23,417
- Alpha, beta...
- Gamma, delta, epsilon, zeta...

525
00:58:23,542 --> 00:58:25,419
eta, theta, iota, kappa, lambda,
mu, nu, xi, omicron, pi...

526
00:58:25,669 --> 00:58:29,548
rho, sigma, tau, upsilon, phi, chi, psi,
omega, sir! Maybe that's what it is!

527
00:58:29,798 --> 00:58:32,426
Don't fucking look at me!
Look down.

528
00:58:39,766 --> 00:58:41,768
All right.

529
00:58:43,687 --> 00:58:48,442
So, you pledges, you guys know
what you need to do for me.

530
00:58:48,692 --> 00:58:55,157
Take a shower and if anyone gives
any trouble, tell I said it was ok.

531
00:58:58,910 --> 00:59:01,329
What?

532
00:59:04,583 --> 00:59:06,585
Shower up, bitch.

533
00:59:11,339 --> 00:59:15,677
- Where are you taking me?
- I'm not telling.

534
00:59:25,479 --> 00:59:28,315
Oh my God!

535
00:59:33,361 --> 00:59:36,823
Wow. It's beautiful.

536
00:59:37,574 --> 00:59:39,993
Go on. Sit down.

537
00:59:40,202 --> 00:59:42,871
Thank you.

538
00:59:52,380 --> 00:59:55,467
Why are you doing this for me?

539
00:59:55,634 --> 00:59:58,261
When I woke up
this morning...

540
00:59:59,262 --> 01:00:02,140
I saw your smile.

541
01:00:02,390 --> 01:00:04,476
That smile.

542
01:00:05,227 --> 01:00:11,733
And I knew that I wanted to spend
the rest of my life with you.

543
01:00:25,038 --> 01:00:28,667
I've been looking all over for you.
Someone trashed your car.

544
01:00:36,383 --> 01:00:38,927
What the...?

545
01:00:39,553 --> 01:00:43,181
Who did this?
Who did it?

546
01:00:43,431 --> 01:00:45,684
It was probably those
Beta fuckers!

547
01:00:48,812 --> 01:00:52,941
How did somebody get away with this
right in front of the frat house?

548
01:00:54,818 --> 01:00:59,197
- Dude, what is that, a dog collar?
- Tommy.

549
01:01:00,282 --> 01:01:03,076
Don't.

550
01:01:03,535 --> 01:01:05,412
He might be watching.

551
01:01:06,329 --> 01:01:10,709
It's my fault. I should've told you
that he was released few weeks ago.

552
01:01:11,293 --> 01:01:13,920
Might've been nice.

553
01:01:23,847 --> 01:01:27,976
Like this will do any good.
Maybe one of the frat guys got a gun.

554
01:01:28,185 --> 01:01:32,105
Evan! Don't even joke!
He's not gonna hurt you, okay?

555
01:01:32,355 --> 01:01:34,941
He's just trying to scare
you away from me.

556
01:01:35,108 --> 01:01:39,696
- He killed my dog. Remember?
- Evan, it's not his fault.

557
01:01:39,946 --> 01:01:42,449
You know how bad he
had it when we were kids.

558
01:01:42,616 --> 01:01:46,244
Oh, no. Don't give me
this bad upbringing shit.

559
01:01:46,494 --> 01:01:50,123
- You turned out just fine.
- My father never laid a hand on me!

560
01:01:50,874 --> 01:01:54,753
It's like that prick
saved it all for Tommy!

561
01:01:58,506 --> 01:02:01,760
All right.

562
01:02:05,013 --> 01:02:07,974
We'll let campus
security deal with it.

563
01:02:10,018 --> 01:02:13,355
I think I should sleep alone.

564
01:02:14,522 --> 01:02:17,275
No. You're not staying alone.
I'm staying with you.

565
01:02:17,525 --> 01:02:20,904
Evan, I just don't want Tommy
to see us together right now.

566
01:02:21,154 --> 01:02:24,282
No. I lost you once and
I'm not losing you again.

567
01:02:24,532 --> 01:02:29,621
What do you mean? Evan, you never
lost me. What are you talking about?

568
01:02:29,788 --> 01:02:33,041
God, you've been acting
so weird lately!

569
01:02:33,291 --> 01:02:36,920
Look, my car just got wrecked, okay.
I'm kind of freaked out.

570
01:02:37,170 --> 01:02:42,300
I know, but your accent's changed,
you don't even walk the same.

571
01:02:42,550 --> 01:02:45,303
- I walk differently?
- I mean, that dinner tonight...

572
01:02:45,553 --> 01:02:47,889
It was so beautiful,
it was gorgeous...

573
01:02:48,056 --> 01:02:53,687
...but it just wasn't you.
- I can't do something nice for you?

574
01:02:53,812 --> 01:02:58,650
Wait.
Isn't that your jacket?

575
01:03:07,826 --> 01:03:09,786
Tommy!

576
01:03:11,162 --> 01:03:15,333
- Stay away from us, you sick fuck.
- Get this "us" shit.

577
01:03:15,583 --> 01:03:18,211
Like I'd ever lay a hand
on my own sister.

578
01:03:18,461 --> 01:03:22,424
You've done real nice for yourself.
You got a nice life...

579
01:03:23,049 --> 01:03:26,928
you got nice friends. Not to
mention you're fucking my sister.

580
01:03:27,095 --> 01:03:30,056
- Not a bad piece of ass if I say so.
- Shut up, Tommy!

581
01:03:30,223 --> 01:03:32,225
Oh, come on.
That's a compliment.

582
01:03:32,726 --> 01:03:37,689
- What are you doing, man?
- It's not good the world loves you...

583
01:03:37,856 --> 01:03:41,109
you got to take the only thing that
doesn't think I'm a piece of shit?

584
01:03:41,359 --> 01:03:44,863
- Tommy, you know I love you.
- No one thinks you're a shit.

585
01:03:45,113 --> 01:03:48,700
Oh, yeah? What was it you said?
I believe it was, "sick fuck"!

586
01:03:48,867 --> 01:03:50,869
No! Tommy!

587
01:03:53,705 --> 01:03:56,583
Stop! Stop!

588
01:03:57,584 --> 01:04:01,963
- Oh, my God!
- Tommy...

589
01:04:03,506 --> 01:04:05,759
Stop!
Oh my God!

590
01:04:12,015 --> 01:04:17,270
- Stop it! You're going to kill him!
- He's a fucking maniac!

591
01:04:18,354 --> 01:04:20,899
Don't do this,
I'm begging you!

592
01:04:21,107 --> 01:04:25,403
You ruined Lenny's life!
You killed Crockett!

593
01:04:25,653 --> 01:04:27,405
You killed that
woman and her baby!

594
01:04:28,907 --> 01:04:31,117
Now you're trying to kill me!

595
01:04:31,409 --> 01:04:34,120
You're trying to
fucking kill me!

596
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:51,805
Oh my God!
What did you do?

597
01:04:52,430 --> 01:04:54,808
Drop the bat!

598
01:05:25,839 --> 01:05:28,716
You, faggy!

599
01:05:55,368 --> 01:05:57,453
First time?

600
01:05:57,620 --> 01:05:59,581
Yeah.

601
01:06:00,623 --> 01:06:06,379
Better not bitch out, man. You'll
wind up someone's luggage that way.

602
01:06:11,259 --> 01:06:14,012
Can you protect me?

603
01:06:14,220 --> 01:06:18,224
Jesus himself couldn't make me
stand up against the Brotherhood.

604
01:06:29,027 --> 01:06:31,404
Look man...

605
01:06:31,779 --> 01:06:33,740
when they come...

606
01:06:34,908 --> 01:06:40,747
you go someplace else in your head.
Be somewhere else.

607
01:06:57,430 --> 01:07:01,768
- Back your ass off!
- Move your ass.

608
01:07:11,277 --> 01:07:13,196
Hey, yo!
Give me that.

609
01:07:30,463 --> 01:07:33,174
I spoke to your lawyer...

610
01:07:33,424 --> 01:07:37,345
and he says he's sure he can
get you off on self-defense.

611
01:07:37,553 --> 01:07:41,224
- So if you're just patient...
- Mom...

612
01:07:42,559 --> 01:07:46,187
...how long am I gonna be in here?
- I don't know.

613
01:07:46,854 --> 01:07:49,941
These things take time.

614
01:07:50,441 --> 01:07:53,987
What about the journals? Did you
bring the ones that I asked to?

615
01:07:54,320 --> 01:07:56,864
I found these two.

616
01:07:57,073 --> 01:08:01,369
- The others are still in storage.
- Mom!

617
01:08:07,250 --> 01:08:10,378
I need them all.
All of them.

618
01:08:10,586 --> 01:08:16,593
I'm going to get them to you, but now
you need to concentrate on the case.

619
01:08:20,179 --> 01:08:23,224
Please.

620
01:08:23,975 --> 01:08:26,185
Fine.

621
01:08:26,352 --> 01:08:29,355
You're right.

622
01:08:31,983 --> 01:08:35,862
What about Kayleigh?
Is she all right?

623
01:08:40,867 --> 01:08:44,746
Try to tell her I'm sorry.

624
01:08:46,623 --> 01:08:49,626
- Time's up.
- I'm not gonna lose you, kiddo.

625
01:08:50,001 --> 01:08:53,338
Promise me you'll hang on.

626
01:09:07,268 --> 01:09:11,731
Shit on my dick or
blood on my knife.

627
01:09:18,529 --> 01:09:19,530
They're mine.

628
01:09:38,383 --> 01:09:40,802
Back the fuck off!

629
01:09:41,135 --> 01:09:43,679
Show's over, ladies.

630
01:09:45,932 --> 01:09:48,559
- Get this maggot back to his cell.
- Move!

631
01:10:05,952 --> 01:10:09,831
We'll be seeing you later
on tonight, little sister.

632
01:10:38,359 --> 01:10:41,070
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

633
01:10:42,071 --> 01:10:44,073
Come on, Reece!

634
01:10:49,245 --> 01:10:50,872
You're religious, Carlos.

635
01:10:51,330 --> 01:10:55,835
Do you believe in that whole bit
"the Lord works in mysterious ways"?

636
01:10:56,627 --> 01:10:58,588
Straight up, man.

637
01:10:58,755 --> 01:11:02,758
Because I think Jesus sent me
to your cell for a reason.

638
01:11:03,217 --> 01:11:06,095
For you to help me.

639
01:11:06,262 --> 01:11:10,266
Shit. I knew you
were crazy, man.

640
01:11:10,516 --> 01:11:13,644
I ain't bullshitting you.
Jesus speaks to me in my dreams.

641
01:11:14,353 --> 01:11:18,357
Oh, yeah?
That's cool. Great.

642
01:11:19,775 --> 01:11:22,904
Pack of smokes says
I can prove it to you.

643
01:11:26,407 --> 01:11:30,870
When I'm out, I need you to watch
my hands and face closely.

644
01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:36,167
- You need to see the prison shrink.
- Tell me if you see anything weird.

645
01:11:38,377 --> 01:11:42,131
- Weirder than this?
- It could be marks, scars, anything.

646
01:11:45,551 --> 01:11:48,888
"On Wednesday I got in trouble
for a drawing I didn't do.

647
01:11:49,055 --> 01:11:51,432
Mommy won't let me see it."

648
01:12:06,197 --> 01:12:10,076
Hey! No monkey business, Evan.
Sit down and finish your drawing.

649
01:12:13,579 --> 01:12:17,792
That's great. Just imagine what
you want to be. There's no limits.

650
01:12:28,594 --> 01:12:30,972
Oh, Mrs. Boswell?

651
01:12:34,058 --> 01:12:39,105
Sweet Jesus! It's a miracle!
Look, it's stigmata, man!

652
01:12:39,313 --> 01:12:44,860
- What'd you see? What'd it look like?
- Signs of Lord come out of nowhere!

653
01:12:45,069 --> 01:12:48,990
Man, I thought you
were fucking crazy.

654
01:12:50,449 --> 01:12:55,496
- So now you believe me?
- Straight up, man.

655
01:13:07,341 --> 01:13:10,469
Want to make a deal?

656
01:13:12,138 --> 01:13:16,475
All right, look. I'm new here,
but I think I get how things work.

657
01:13:18,019 --> 01:13:21,147
You either join a
gang or you're dead.

658
01:13:22,648 --> 01:13:25,610
Well, I sure as fuck ain't joining
up with no spics or niggers.

659
01:13:27,778 --> 01:13:32,283
And I don't want to die.
So...

660
01:13:35,411 --> 01:13:41,250
what do I got to do? I'm the new guy.
I got to work my way up so...

661
01:13:42,501 --> 01:13:46,547
should I suck your dick now...

662
01:13:47,548 --> 01:13:50,176
or...?

663
01:13:53,638 --> 01:13:56,515
Is your blood pure?

664
01:13:56,682 --> 01:14:00,311
Well, I ain't no fucking kike
if that's what you're asking me.

665
01:14:00,519 --> 01:14:03,522
Well, then, let's see
what you got, honey.

666
01:14:04,273 --> 01:14:08,694
- Watch the teeth or leave without.
- Yes, sir.

667
01:14:17,411 --> 01:14:18,829
Come to Daddy.

668
01:14:23,709 --> 01:14:24,961
Carlos!

669
01:14:31,968 --> 01:14:36,097
"We took the woods so we wouldn't
bump into Tommy. No smoke yet."

670
01:14:37,848 --> 01:14:40,309
Hold them! Hold them!

671
01:14:40,476 --> 01:14:44,689
"We took the woods so we wouldn't
bump into Tommy. No smoke yet."

672
01:14:49,694 --> 01:14:53,614
Rot in hell you
fucking animals!

673
01:14:53,948 --> 01:14:56,701
Wait, before we...

674
01:14:56,867 --> 01:14:59,870
we need something
to cut open the sack.

675
01:15:10,506 --> 01:15:13,759
I want you to take this, Lenny.
Today's your day of atonement.

676
01:15:14,010 --> 01:15:16,887
I know guilty you feel about
that woman and her baby.

677
01:15:17,096 --> 01:15:20,766
- Evan, stop it. It's not the time.
- Now's the only time!

678
01:15:20,975 --> 01:15:24,145
Today's your chance to redeem
yourself, to start over clean slate!

679
01:15:24,353 --> 01:15:26,605
- What are you talking about?
- Evan, you're acting crazy.

680
01:15:26,772 --> 01:15:29,900
Please! If you ever trusted
me before, trust me on this one!

681
01:15:34,155 --> 01:15:36,407
Cut the rope.

682
01:15:39,618 --> 01:15:41,787
Come on!

683
01:15:43,414 --> 01:15:46,292
- Listen to me good, Evan.
- I'll do what you want.

684
01:15:46,417 --> 01:15:50,379
You don't want me to see Kayleigh
again, fine. Just let Crockett go.

685
01:15:50,546 --> 01:15:54,175
Besides, if you kill him now,
they'll stick you in juvy for sure!

686
01:15:54,383 --> 01:15:56,510
And I know you'd never leave
your sister alone with your father.

687
01:16:08,814 --> 01:16:11,650
Lenny, no!

688
01:16:17,072 --> 01:16:19,075
My God, Lenny.

689
01:16:19,325 --> 01:16:21,827
I said cut the rope!

690
01:16:44,350 --> 01:16:47,728
It's all backwards.

691
01:16:58,697 --> 01:16:59,615
Evan?

692
01:17:00,741 --> 01:17:01,826
Who did this?

693
01:17:04,370 --> 01:17:05,371
What the fuck, weirdo?

694
01:17:10,459 --> 01:17:12,002
Lenny, no!

695
01:17:14,338 --> 01:17:15,589
Wanna a ride?

696
01:17:16,757 --> 01:17:18,759
Lenny.

697
01:17:22,721 --> 01:17:25,516
Somebody call 91 1 !

698
01:17:25,766 --> 01:17:28,018
Evan! Evan!
Fuck, Evan!

699
01:17:37,403 --> 01:17:40,030
Hey, doc. What's the damage?
How much time do I got?

700
01:17:40,406 --> 01:17:41,407
Cute, Evan.

701
01:17:42,032 --> 01:17:46,412
It's a little complicated. I haven't
seen results like these before.

702
01:17:46,620 --> 01:17:49,164
Not even with my father?

703
01:17:49,415 --> 01:17:53,002
Well, actually they didn't
have these tests 20 years ago.

704
01:17:53,168 --> 01:17:56,547
- So, what did you find?
- Most of the hemorrhaging is coming...

705
01:17:56,797 --> 01:17:59,425
from the outer layer
of the cerebral cortex.

706
01:17:59,633 --> 01:18:02,887
- That's where memories are stored.
- Thank you, Evan.

707
01:18:03,304 --> 01:18:07,182
I've never seen anything like it. We
compared these to last year's ones...

708
01:18:07,433 --> 01:18:10,436
we found severe hemorrhaging
and massive neural reconstruction.

709
01:18:10,686 --> 01:18:12,688
- What does that mean for Evan?
- He's saying...

710
01:18:12,897 --> 01:18:15,649
I've jammed 40 years worth of
memories into my head in a year.

711
01:18:15,941 --> 01:18:20,571
It's overload city. I've completely
reprogrammed my brain. Isn't it, doc?

712
01:18:20,779 --> 01:18:22,948
Yeah.

713
01:18:25,409 --> 01:18:29,705
I'm going to wait in the car. Light
in here is kind of bugging my eyes.

714
01:18:30,789 --> 01:18:36,337
It was good seeing you, doc.
It was very informative.

715
01:18:36,587 --> 01:18:40,591
But, you know, I got people
to see, things to read...

716
01:19:19,630 --> 01:19:22,758
It's me, Evan.

717
01:19:24,009 --> 01:19:27,137
Can I get you anything?

718
01:19:28,222 --> 01:19:32,351
What about some of those
model airplanes you like, huh?

719
01:19:34,019 --> 01:19:36,355
I bet I can get a shitload of
model airplanes up in here.

720
01:19:39,858 --> 01:19:41,610
Lenny!

721
01:19:49,618 --> 01:19:52,871
You knew the whole time,
didn't you?

722
01:19:54,790 --> 01:20:00,546
When you put that
shard in my hand...

723
01:20:01,630 --> 01:20:07,928
you knew something big was
gonna happen. Didn't you?

724
01:20:08,679 --> 01:20:10,931
Yeah.

725
01:20:11,140 --> 01:20:16,061
- I knew.
- Then you should be where I am.

726
01:20:17,813 --> 01:20:22,693
You should be where I am.

727
01:20:42,713 --> 01:20:46,050
"Today I get to meet my father.

728
01:20:46,216 --> 01:20:48,969
His name is Jason...

729
01:20:49,219 --> 01:20:51,847
and he's crazy.

730
01:20:52,973 --> 01:20:55,100
I hope he lets me call him Dad."

731
01:20:56,727 --> 01:21:01,231
You ok? Because you looked like you
went somewhere else for a second.

732
01:21:01,815 --> 01:21:05,611
I need some fast answers from you if
I'm ever going to fix what I've done.

733
01:21:07,613 --> 01:21:09,948
I prayed this curse
would end with me.

734
01:21:10,115 --> 01:21:14,119
It didn't. So now I need information
to make things right again...

735
01:21:14,328 --> 01:21:17,373
...you're the one that can give it.
- There is no "right"!

736
01:21:18,207 --> 01:21:20,709
You can't change who people are
without destroying who they were.

737
01:21:20,876 --> 01:21:22,878
Who says you can't
make things better?

738
01:21:23,128 --> 01:21:26,382
You can't play God, son!

739
01:21:27,633 --> 01:21:31,637
It must end with me. Just by being
here you may be killing your mother.

740
01:21:32,971 --> 01:21:38,644
Bullshit. I'll send you a postcard
when I made all perfect again.

741
01:21:40,270 --> 01:21:41,730
No, no!

742
01:22:03,419 --> 01:22:06,171
Just get out, did you?

743
01:22:07,923 --> 01:22:13,554
Nothing. My brother did a stint in
the pen and he used to eat like that.

744
01:22:14,263 --> 01:22:19,017
- I come from a big family.
- Well, I meant no offense.

745
01:22:20,310 --> 01:22:22,813
None taken.

746
01:22:24,565 --> 01:22:27,693
Is Kayleigh Miller
still working here?

747
01:22:28,318 --> 01:22:32,072
Sorry, I never heard of her.

748
01:22:47,963 --> 01:22:51,717
God! Can't a man get a little
goddamned peace in his own house?

749
01:22:55,304 --> 01:22:59,725
- You're not selling cookies.
- Good guess, fuckbag.

750
01:23:01,351 --> 01:23:06,732
Remember me? We had
a nice chat once when I was 7.

751
01:23:07,733 --> 01:23:11,945
I got one guestion for you.
Where can I find your daughter?

752
01:23:46,772 --> 01:23:49,399
I thought you were
someone else.

753
01:23:52,653 --> 01:23:56,156
Make it fast,
I'm expecting someone.

754
01:23:57,282 --> 01:24:00,911
It's good to see you.

755
01:24:02,037 --> 01:24:04,039
Can I come in?

756
01:24:04,289 --> 01:24:08,502
If I knew you were coming
I would have cleaned the sheets.

757
01:24:14,424 --> 01:24:16,802
What do you want?

758
01:24:17,010 --> 01:24:22,307
- Just to see a friendly face.
- Time is money, Evan.

759
01:24:24,309 --> 01:24:26,144
Money.

760
01:24:26,937 --> 01:24:30,816
Guess I can spare 1 0 minutes
for an old friend, right?

761
01:24:31,191 --> 01:24:36,196
So how's tricks?
Sorry. Occupational humor.

762
01:24:36,655 --> 01:24:41,201
I got it.
You can stop know.

763
01:24:42,286 --> 01:24:46,957
Sorry. Does my line of work make
you uncomfortable, precious?

764
01:24:47,165 --> 01:24:51,086
No. Just that you felt like
you had to use it to hurt me.

765
01:24:54,715 --> 01:24:57,467
I've been where you've been.

766
01:24:59,094 --> 01:25:04,182
- Where is that?
- You wouldn't believe if I told you.

767
01:25:04,349 --> 01:25:10,314
I know people always say that, in
this case it's not even worth trying.

768
01:25:14,860 --> 01:25:17,070
I knew I needed to find you.

769
01:25:17,237 --> 01:25:20,866
So I went over to your dad's and
made him tell me where you were.

770
01:25:20,991 --> 01:25:24,870
- Then I came here, the rest you know.
- You're right. I don't believe you.

771
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:27,998
I never thought you would.

772
01:25:28,206 --> 01:25:31,877
That's why I never told a soul
until now and I never will again.

773
01:25:32,127 --> 01:25:37,132
I'm the only person you've told?
That's a great line.

774
01:25:37,633 --> 01:25:42,637
Does that make other girls wet?
Do they actually eat up that bullshit?

775
01:25:45,390 --> 01:25:49,728
You know, I could give a shit
whether you believe me or not.

776
01:25:49,895 --> 01:25:53,231
Frankly, I'm too tired
to prove it to you.

777
01:25:53,398 --> 01:25:56,151
Oh, there's proof now, huh?

778
01:25:56,526 --> 01:25:59,154
How else would I know that you
have twin moles on your inner thigh?

779
01:25:59,654 --> 01:26:02,115
Anyone with $ 50 bucks
could tell you that.

780
01:26:02,282 --> 01:26:05,994
Okay.
Forget that.

781
01:26:06,787 --> 01:26:11,166
How about the fact that you prefer
the smell of skunk to flowers?

782
01:26:11,375 --> 01:26:13,418
Or that you hate cilantro?

783
01:26:13,668 --> 01:26:17,756
For some reason unknown to you,
it reminds you of your stepsister.

784
01:26:17,923 --> 01:26:21,551
Or that when you have
an orgasm your toes go numb?

785
01:26:21,760 --> 01:26:23,887
I'm sure all your
clientele know that.

786
01:26:27,557 --> 01:26:31,186
Look, I just thought
you should know.

787
01:26:31,895 --> 01:26:34,439
Know what?

788
01:26:34,690 --> 01:26:37,401
That you were happy once.

789
01:26:37,567 --> 01:26:39,778
With me.

790
01:26:40,779 --> 01:26:43,698
You know, there's one
major hole in your story.

791
01:26:43,907 --> 01:26:49,413
There's no way on this planet
I'd ever be in a fucking sorority!

792
01:26:53,959 --> 01:26:57,295
- You were happy then.
- You crying?

793
01:26:57,462 --> 01:27:01,967
- Sure you don't want your wallet?
- I don't need it where I'm going.

794
01:27:02,467 --> 01:27:04,719
Are you off to change
everyone else's life again?

795
01:27:05,554 --> 01:27:07,931
Maybe next you'll
pop up in a mansion...

796
01:27:08,098 --> 01:27:10,684
while I end up in Tijuana
doing a donkey act.

797
01:27:11,226 --> 01:27:13,478
You know what?
I'm over it.

798
01:27:13,687 --> 01:27:17,232
Every time I try to help someone,
everything just goes to shit.

799
01:27:17,983 --> 01:27:22,112
Well, don't give up now, slick.
You've already done so much for me!

800
01:27:22,362 --> 01:27:26,616
Why don't you go back in time
and save Mrs. Halpern and her baby?

801
01:27:27,576 --> 01:27:32,497
And then maybe Lenny wouldn't
freak out and ruin my family!

802
01:27:32,622 --> 01:27:34,958
No! Go back to when I was 7...

803
01:27:35,125 --> 01:27:39,838
and fuck me in front of
my daddy's video camera.

804
01:27:40,005 --> 01:27:44,009
Straighten me out a bit.

805
01:27:57,022 --> 01:27:59,274
You're on my bed!
Get out!

806
01:27:59,524 --> 01:28:03,528
Buddy, I thought it'd be okay,
with you being sick and all!

807
01:28:13,914 --> 01:28:17,042
I am not gonna say it again.

808
01:28:23,381 --> 01:28:27,802
"What I remember before the blackout
was my hands over Kayleigh's ears.

809
01:28:28,053 --> 01:28:29,805
I think I was more focused
on her hands on mine...

810
01:28:30,055 --> 01:28:33,058
than on the mailbox
across the street."

811
01:28:39,397 --> 01:28:41,691
Stay back!
Don't go near the mailbox!

812
01:28:42,150 --> 01:28:44,694
- Idiot!
- Get the hell back!

813
01:28:44,945 --> 01:28:46,947
I'll save you, lady!

814
01:28:55,163 --> 01:28:57,958
Goddamn it! I thought
I told you two to get out?

815
01:28:59,918 --> 01:29:02,671
Sorry, man, did we wake you?

816
01:29:03,463 --> 01:29:07,467
No. It's cool.

817
01:29:10,345 --> 01:29:13,348
It's really cool.

818
01:29:33,326 --> 01:29:36,580
What the fuck is this?

819
01:29:42,002 --> 01:29:44,629
- Please save his arm.
- Can you open up my locker?

820
01:29:44,838 --> 01:29:46,631
- Happy Birthday!
- You wanna go now?

821
01:29:46,756 --> 01:29:48,758
- Can I come too?
- Want me to move your popcorn?

822
01:29:50,385 --> 01:29:54,639
Evan?
Get a towel! Get a towel!

823
01:29:55,265 --> 01:29:58,018
Evan! Evan!

824
01:29:59,352 --> 01:30:02,022
- Where you going?
- You ever notice Kayleigh's smile?

825
01:30:03,607 --> 01:30:06,109
- Lenny is the best.
- You guys make a great couple.

826
01:30:07,527 --> 01:30:09,237
You ever think that
I'll find someone?

827
01:30:11,281 --> 01:30:13,158
Evan!

828
01:30:16,995 --> 01:30:19,414
- Where are we going?
- We're taking you to the hospital.

829
01:30:19,623 --> 01:30:23,501
- No! Take me back.
- I'm sorry, your mom would kill me!

830
01:30:25,754 --> 01:30:29,007
You take me back, Lenny!

831
01:30:29,883 --> 01:30:32,761
You owe me that much.

832
01:30:36,139 --> 01:30:40,185
What are you geeks looking at? Must
be nice to be so goddamn perfect?

833
01:30:40,810 --> 01:30:44,689
Fucking losers!
Lenny, help me!

834
01:30:44,940 --> 01:30:46,941
God. Here.
Get him over.

835
01:30:47,692 --> 01:30:52,781
Hey, Brian, how's your head feeling?
I saw that girl you went home with.

836
01:30:52,947 --> 01:30:57,160
- She borrow your razor this morning?
- So bad!

837
01:30:57,786 --> 01:31:00,664
Hey, there's Tommy.
Hey, Tommy! Tommy!

838
01:31:02,832 --> 01:31:06,294
What's up, guys?
Hey, man.

839
01:31:06,461 --> 01:31:10,840
I did what you said. We're pooling
our funds with the Hillel House...

840
01:31:12,217 --> 01:31:16,721
Maybe I can spin my chair to a "Hava
Nagila" techno remix till I puke.

841
01:31:18,723 --> 01:31:22,560
- Maybe we should get to class.
- What's the point of psych class now?

842
01:31:22,727 --> 01:31:26,106
Tomorrow I could wake up
a dirt farmer in Bangladesh.

843
01:31:26,314 --> 01:31:29,359
Let's go for a stroll.

844
01:31:30,694 --> 01:31:33,697
- Yippee.
- Bye, sis. What's up with him?

845
01:31:34,197 --> 01:31:36,616
So Tommy's really into
this Jesus freak thing, huh?

846
01:31:37,117 --> 01:31:42,747
You know how spiritual he's gotten
since saved Mrs. Halpern and Katie.

847
01:31:42,956 --> 01:31:48,128
He saved Mrs. Halpern?
Please. The twisted fuck.

848
01:31:49,254 --> 01:31:52,257
Here. Why don't we sit right here.

849
01:31:59,139 --> 01:32:01,391
Want a granola bar?

850
01:32:03,768 --> 01:32:05,270
Here.

851
01:32:09,774 --> 01:32:13,153
Yeah, I got to fix these
things or something.

852
01:32:14,487 --> 01:32:16,406
Kayleigh...

853
01:32:16,781 --> 01:32:18,783
do you ever think about us?

854
01:32:18,908 --> 01:32:21,411
I mean, do you ever wonder...

855
01:32:21,661 --> 01:32:24,789
if things might've been
different between us?

856
01:32:24,998 --> 01:32:27,250
Sure, Evan.

857
01:32:28,793 --> 01:32:31,171
You were the first person
I really ever cared about.

858
01:32:33,548 --> 01:32:36,134
- I was?
- Yeah.

859
01:32:36,885 --> 01:32:41,389
Yeah. That's why when I was little,
I never went to live with my mother.

860
01:32:41,681 --> 01:32:45,935
- I don't get it.
- When my folks split up...

861
01:32:46,186 --> 01:32:49,564
they gave me and Tommy the
choice who we wanted to live with.

862
01:32:49,773 --> 01:32:52,942
And I couldn't stand my dad,
but I knew that...

863
01:32:53,193 --> 01:32:57,322
if I went to move with my mom
I'd never see you again.

864
01:32:57,697 --> 01:33:00,700
I didn't know that.

865
01:33:00,950 --> 01:33:06,414
So, you still think
about us together?

866
01:33:07,665 --> 01:33:10,919
Well, it's crossed my
mind from time to time.

867
01:33:11,336 --> 01:33:13,213
And...?

868
01:33:13,922 --> 01:33:15,924
Well, a lot of things
have crossed my mind.

869
01:33:16,341 --> 01:33:20,345
I mean, I could play out the entire
movie of our lives in one second.

870
01:33:20,470 --> 01:33:23,598
Boom. We fall in love,
we get married, we have kids...

871
01:33:23,848 --> 01:33:26,351
our kids grow old,
as do we...

872
01:33:26,684 --> 01:33:29,938
matching burial plots,
the whole thing.

873
01:33:30,480 --> 01:33:33,483
It took a lot longer to
spit out than to imagine!

874
01:33:35,693 --> 01:33:38,947
Things like that usually do.

875
01:33:40,365 --> 01:33:43,952
So... do you think that
it might've worth?

876
01:33:44,702 --> 01:33:46,496
Yeah.

877
01:33:48,373 --> 01:33:51,626
I mean, but that's not
how things wound up.

878
01:33:52,710 --> 01:33:55,380
I'm with Lenny.

879
01:33:56,381 --> 01:33:58,591
Lenny is your friend...

880
01:34:00,969 --> 01:34:03,888
And that's where it ends.

881
01:34:05,348 --> 01:34:07,141
Well...

882
01:34:08,226 --> 01:34:12,021
would it make a
difference if I told you...

883
01:34:12,230 --> 01:34:15,233
that no one could possibly ever
love anyone as much as I love you?

884
01:34:24,409 --> 01:34:27,745
I'm not saying that.

885
01:34:27,912 --> 01:34:31,791
- Yeah.
- I'm just saying it, like...

886
01:34:32,166 --> 01:34:35,545
if you were a girl would that be
something that you'll wanna hear.

887
01:34:40,425 --> 01:34:44,804
Hold on one second, Lenny's calling.
I'll be right back, Ev, okay?

888
01:34:51,060 --> 01:34:54,147
He's a little down.
He'll be all right.

889
01:35:51,621 --> 01:35:54,999
You forgot to put the
toaster on the ledge.

890
01:35:55,250 --> 01:36:00,630
Lenny likes Pop-Tarts.
You guys are all better now.

891
01:36:03,258 --> 01:36:06,469
Man, I know it's hard,
but you can't give up.

892
01:36:06,636 --> 01:36:10,765
- I can't even fucking kill myself.
- Don't talk like that.

893
01:36:20,650 --> 01:36:25,530
I got to get you out of here.
Visiting hours are almost over.

894
01:36:29,158 --> 01:36:31,869
Mom get transferred again?

895
01:36:32,120 --> 01:36:34,664
What are you talking about?
She's been here the entire time.

896
01:36:42,547 --> 01:36:47,552
Looking good, kiddo.

897
01:36:51,806 --> 01:36:57,020
"Lung cancer." You started chain
smoking when I blew myself up.

898
01:36:57,186 --> 01:37:00,314
Sorry, Mrs. T, he's been
acting out of sorts lately.

899
01:37:00,565 --> 01:37:05,069
Mom, you're gonna be okay.
I can change it.

900
01:37:05,320 --> 01:37:08,197
I'm going go down to the chapel.

901
01:37:09,407 --> 01:37:13,536
You're acting...

902
01:37:13,703 --> 01:37:16,456
just... like your father.

903
01:37:17,415 --> 01:37:20,335
- I'm going to get you out of here.
- No.

904
01:37:21,544 --> 01:37:25,089
You're not gonna hurt anymore.
I'm going to fix it.

905
01:37:25,298 --> 01:37:27,216
No.

906
01:37:33,598 --> 01:37:36,809
- Are you sure you even packed it?
- My mom packed it.

907
01:37:36,976 --> 01:37:39,354
I think she sent
everything I ever owned.

908
01:37:39,604 --> 01:37:40,730
- Is this it?
- Yeah.

909
01:37:40,938 --> 01:37:44,233
- What's it for? I don't get you lately.
- Duly noted.

910
01:37:48,613 --> 01:37:50,448
- I have to ask you one last favor.
- What?

911
01:37:50,615 --> 01:37:54,952
Be guiet. I have to concentrate
to destroy the blockbuster.

912
01:37:55,995 --> 01:37:59,248
- What? The blockbuster?
- Lf I hadn't blown off my arms...

913
01:37:59,457 --> 01:38:04,128
my mom would have never started
smoking. Never mind. Just open it.

914
01:38:06,380 --> 01:38:07,965
Turn it.

915
01:38:08,132 --> 01:38:09,967
There.

916
01:38:14,138 --> 01:38:17,975
"Today Mommy is taking me
to play with Kayleigh and Tommy.

917
01:38:18,226 --> 01:38:21,646
I will meet their father and
see what a real dad is like."

918
01:38:24,732 --> 01:38:27,985
Now, how do I
destroy the blockbuster?

919
01:38:42,166 --> 01:38:43,000
Evan?

920
01:38:44,001 --> 01:38:47,004
What are you doing
with that knife?

921
01:38:49,507 --> 01:38:52,426
That didn't work.
You want to...?

922
01:38:52,677 --> 01:38:54,429
Turn it.

923
01:38:54,679 --> 01:38:56,180
Turn it. There.

924
01:38:58,182 --> 01:39:01,185
"I never wanted to be
in the movie anyway.

925
01:39:01,435 --> 01:39:05,064
I wanted to wear my clothes.
Mr. Miller took my shirt off."

926
01:39:05,690 --> 01:39:11,279
And in this part of the story, Robin
Hood has just married Maid Marian...

927
01:39:11,446 --> 01:39:15,700
and they have to kiss and
stuff like grownups do.

928
01:39:15,950 --> 01:39:19,078
Wait.
I need my belt.

929
01:39:25,042 --> 01:39:27,670
Don't even bother about a belt.

930
01:39:28,963 --> 01:39:33,843
Back off, fuckbag. Amazing that
word never fails to impress you.

931
01:39:35,720 --> 01:39:37,555
Easy does it, Evan.

932
01:39:37,722 --> 01:39:42,059
Don't be a bad boy or I'll tell your
ma what a naughty little shit you are.

933
01:39:42,226 --> 01:39:46,689
I'll tell child protective service of
your little kiddie porn endeavors.

934
01:39:46,856 --> 01:39:49,233
One step closer and
I'll shove this up your ass.

935
01:39:49,484 --> 01:39:52,570
- You could blow off your hands.
- Been there, done that.

936
01:40:01,204 --> 01:40:03,080
- Sparkler.
- Kayleigh, no!

937
01:40:04,081 --> 01:40:06,834
No! Kayleigh, no!

938
01:40:13,591 --> 01:40:15,092
Hey, man?

939
01:40:17,637 --> 01:40:18,387
Good, kiddo.

940
01:40:18,888 --> 01:40:20,514
I've got no choice but to...

941
01:40:20,723 --> 01:40:24,644
Evan, you'll have to live
somewhere else for a while.

942
01:40:25,853 --> 01:40:26,854
I'm so sick of it!

943
01:40:29,398 --> 01:40:30,733
I want my medication.

944
01:40:33,277 --> 01:40:34,612
How do they treat you?

945
01:40:59,303 --> 01:41:03,307
- Where are my goddamn books?
- We're not supposed to meet for...

946
01:41:03,557 --> 01:41:07,311
...another hour.
- Where are my goddamn books?

947
01:41:07,687 --> 01:41:09,438
Books?

948
01:41:09,814 --> 01:41:13,150
My journals.
I need them.

949
01:41:13,317 --> 01:41:17,405
So if you could give them to me,
it'll help a lot.

950
01:41:17,571 --> 01:41:21,659
It hurts me to go through this again.
There are no journals.

951
01:41:23,077 --> 01:41:24,704
There never were.

952
01:41:24,954 --> 01:41:30,084
It's part of the fantasy created to
cope with the guilt of kill Kayleigh.

953
01:41:31,460 --> 01:41:34,213
Think, Evan. Think!

954
01:41:34,422 --> 01:41:37,300
You've created a disease
that does not exist.

955
01:41:37,925 --> 01:41:43,097
Alternate universes with colleges
and prisons and paraplegia.

956
01:41:43,306 --> 01:41:45,933
I want my journals now!

957
01:41:46,100 --> 01:41:48,561
I know you got them!
You're going to give them to me!

958
01:41:48,728 --> 01:41:51,480
You're not going to hide
them from me! I want them!

959
01:41:53,316 --> 01:41:55,985
You remind me of your father.

960
01:41:56,235 --> 01:42:00,823
He was always screaming for a photo
album even though he never had one.

961
01:42:01,616 --> 01:42:04,577
I'm so sorry.

962
01:42:07,371 --> 01:42:09,206
Photo album?

963
01:42:09,707 --> 01:42:12,501
- Photos.
- Evan?

964
01:42:15,713 --> 01:42:19,258
The damage is irreparable.

965
01:42:23,262 --> 01:42:28,017
Frankly, I'm surprised he still
has use of his motor functions.

966
01:42:36,275 --> 01:42:38,235
Mom?

967
01:42:40,529 --> 01:42:45,159
Did you remember to bring those
home movies that we used to make?

968
01:42:45,409 --> 01:42:48,120
Yeah, they're right here.

969
01:42:48,621 --> 01:42:53,667
Good. Because I really
like to watch them.

970
01:42:56,545 --> 01:42:59,173
So that's good.

971
01:43:03,427 --> 01:43:07,890
I think it's best we transfer him to
Bellevue first thing in the morning.

972
01:43:49,432 --> 01:43:52,560
"If anyone finds this...

973
01:43:52,977 --> 01:43:57,106
it means that my
plan didn't work...

974
01:43:57,356 --> 01:43:59,817
and I'm already dead."

975
01:44:02,236 --> 01:44:04,196
He's not in his room.
Search the grounds!

976
01:44:04,363 --> 01:44:07,992
"But if I can somehow
go back...

977
01:44:08,242 --> 01:44:10,995
to the beginning
of all of this...

978
01:44:11,203 --> 01:44:13,748
I might be able...

979
01:44:13,998 --> 01:44:14,874
to save her."

980
01:44:15,499 --> 01:44:17,001
Evan!

981
01:44:18,627 --> 01:44:20,880
- Over here!
- Evan!

982
01:44:23,966 --> 01:44:25,509
Evan!

983
01:44:28,012 --> 01:44:29,138
- What's your name?
- Kayleigh.

984
01:44:29,388 --> 01:44:31,849
This is Evan.

985
01:44:32,349 --> 01:44:35,019
Evan!
Let me in!

986
01:44:39,356 --> 01:44:42,276
Say hi. Go on

987
01:44:56,165 --> 01:44:58,167
I hate you.
If you come near me again...

988
01:44:58,375 --> 01:45:02,296
I'll kill you
and your whole damn family!

989
01:45:07,802 --> 01:45:11,514
What happened, sweetie?
What's wrong?

990
01:45:12,014 --> 01:45:14,266
Goodbye.

991
01:45:19,563 --> 01:45:20,564
Sparkler.

992
01:45:26,153 --> 01:45:27,696
Kayleigh, Tommy!

993
01:45:28,656 --> 01:45:32,952
I missed you. I'll never let you
out of my sight again.

994
01:45:37,414 --> 01:45:40,417
Like the sacrifices our parents
have made for us to be here today.

995
01:45:42,294 --> 01:45:43,838
Good, Tommy!

996
01:45:47,675 --> 01:45:50,094
Are you all right?

997
01:45:51,595 --> 01:45:54,932
- Where's Kayleigh?
- Who's Kayleigh?

998
01:45:56,100 --> 01:46:03,357
"Who's Kayleigh?"

999
01:46:03,566 --> 01:46:07,194
- Want me to take you to the doctor?
- No.

1000
01:46:14,493 --> 01:46:19,373
No. I think everything's gonna
be all right this time.

1001
01:46:34,138 --> 01:46:36,891
You sure about this?

1002
01:46:38,267 --> 01:46:42,897
I know who I am. I don't need
a bunch of stuff to remind me.

1003
01:47:04,919 --> 01:47:09,256
I'm just running a little late.
I had to finish up with a patient.

1004
01:47:11,300 --> 01:47:13,427
Well, get the soup
or something.

1005
01:47:13,677 --> 01:47:17,514
All right.
Love you, Mom.

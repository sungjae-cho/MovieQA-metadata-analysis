1
00:00:18,024 --> 00:00:23,445


2
00:00:55,658 --> 00:00:56,951
- J'ai.

3
00:00:57,076 --> 00:00:59,911
- Tu as.
- Tu as.

4
00:01:00,037 --> 00:01:02,539
- ll a.
- ll a.

5
00:01:02,665 --> 00:01:05,501
- Nous avons.
- Nous avons.

6
00:01:05,626 --> 00:01:08,420
Nous avons. Nous avons.

7
00:01:08,546 --> 00:01:12,674
- Vous avez.
- Vous avez.

8
00:01:12,801 --> 00:01:15,427
- lls ont.
- lls ont.

9
00:01:15,554 --> 00:01:17,805
Nous avons.

10
00:01:24,103 --> 00:01:26,396
Vous avez.

11
00:01:40,829 --> 00:01:43,997
Time travel
has not yet been invented,

12
00:01:44,123 --> 00:01:47,668
but 30 years from now,
it will have been.

13
00:01:49,754 --> 00:01:52,423
lt will be instantly outlawed,

14
00:01:52,549 --> 00:01:54,216
used only in secret

15
00:01:54,343 --> 00:01:56,968
by the largest
criminal organizations.

16
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:09,481
It's nearly impossible

17
00:02:09,608 --> 00:02:12,985
to dispose of a body
in the future, I'm told,

18
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:15,320
with tagging techniques
and whatnot.

19
00:02:15,447 --> 00:02:17,740
So, when these criminal
organizations in the future

20
00:02:17,865 --> 00:02:19,241
need someone gone,

21
00:02:19,367 --> 00:02:22,829
they use specialized assassins
in our present

22
00:02:22,954 --> 00:02:25,247
called loopers.

23
00:02:25,373 --> 00:02:31,127
And so, my employers
in the future nab the target,

24
00:02:31,254 --> 00:02:34,215
they zap him back to me,
their looper.

25
00:02:34,341 --> 00:02:37,509
He appears,
hands tied and head sacked,

26
00:02:37,635 --> 00:02:40,346
and I do the necessaries.

27
00:02:40,472 --> 00:02:42,764
Collect my silver.

28
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:46,185
So the target is vanished
from the future

29
00:02:46,311 --> 00:02:48,687
and I've just disposed of a body

30
00:02:48,813 --> 00:02:50,272
that technically does not exist.

31
00:02:53,151 --> 00:02:55,402
Clean.

32
00:03:02,201 --> 00:03:03,995
- Bonjour, Joe.

33
00:03:04,121 --> 00:03:05,454
- Bonjour, Beatrix.

34
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:06,705
- How's the French?

35
00:03:06,831 --> 00:03:07,998
- Slow.

36
00:03:08,125 --> 00:03:09,250
- How's the coffee?

37
00:03:09,376 --> 00:03:10,626
- Burnt.

38
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:24,806
...the Devil
bringing you into Hell.

39
00:03:24,932 --> 00:03:28,895
You have to heal...
Try, Jesus! Glory!

40
00:03:40,115 --> 00:03:41,281
- Two, Jedd.

41
00:03:48,331 --> 00:03:50,206
- Hey, Joe?
Be at the club tonight?

42
00:03:50,334 --> 00:03:51,667
- Yeah.

43
00:03:53,045 --> 00:03:54,711
- Four, Jedd.

44
00:04:03,013 --> 00:04:06,014
Ravi de...
Ravi de te voir.

45
00:04:15,108 --> 00:04:17,526
Bonjour, mademoiselle.

46
00:04:19,821 --> 00:04:21,738
Bang.

47
00:04:58,235 --> 00:05:00,485
- Hey, walk around.

48
00:05:00,612 --> 00:05:02,196
Around the bike!
I'm not kidding.

49
00:05:02,322 --> 00:05:03,863
- Hey, hey, I don't want
no trouble, mister.

50
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:05,449
- Walk around, you shit.
- You're just rude.

51
00:05:05,574 --> 00:05:07,910
lf you even had a mama,
she didn't raise you right.

52
00:05:08,036 --> 00:05:09,536
- That's funny,
because I'm going to pick

53
00:05:09,663 --> 00:05:11,622
your mother up later
on my bike, and I'm

54
00:05:11,747 --> 00:05:13,665
going to take my blunderbuss...
- Hey, Seth.

55
00:05:13,791 --> 00:05:15,418
- Hey, Joe.

56
00:05:15,543 --> 00:05:16,668
- That's new.

57
00:05:16,795 --> 00:05:18,045
- Yeah, thanks.

58
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:21,257
Goddamn thing
won't fuckin' start.

59
00:05:22,425 --> 00:05:24,134
So you going to the Belle?

60
00:05:25,637 --> 00:05:26,971
So you bought a slat bike?

61
00:05:27,096 --> 00:05:28,471
- Asshole!
- Yup.

62
00:05:28,598 --> 00:05:31,100
- How much that thing
set you back? How much?

63
00:05:31,225 --> 00:05:33,269
- I was going to pull up
in it tonight.

64
00:05:33,394 --> 00:05:34,812
- Well, congratulations.

65
00:05:34,937 --> 00:05:36,312
You're pulling up with me instead.

66
00:05:36,439 --> 00:05:37,731
Don't.

67
00:05:37,858 --> 00:05:39,608
lf we're going in,
don't do that.

68
00:05:39,735 --> 00:05:41,401
- Chicks dig TKs.

69
00:05:41,528 --> 00:05:42,653
- They do not.

70
00:05:42,778 --> 00:05:43,903
- Yes, they do.

71
00:05:44,031 --> 00:05:45,156
- Look, it's tacky.

72
00:05:45,281 --> 00:05:46,781
Don't do it.

73
00:05:48,409 --> 00:05:52,413
of the population
has this TK mutation.

74
00:05:52,538 --> 00:05:54,081
When it first appeared,

75
00:05:54,206 --> 00:05:56,709
everyone thought we
were going to get superheroes.

76
00:05:56,834 --> 00:05:58,668
But it turns out this was it.

77
00:05:58,795 --> 00:06:00,713
Now it's just a bunch of assholes

78
00:06:00,838 --> 00:06:03,548
think they're blowing your mind
floating quarters.

79
00:06:14,728 --> 00:06:16,437
It's like this whole town.

80
00:06:16,562 --> 00:06:20,815
Big heads, small potatoes.

81
00:06:29,326 --> 00:06:31,076
- Full house tonight, Joe.

82
00:06:31,202 --> 00:06:32,327
- We'll stick backstage.

83
00:06:32,454 --> 00:06:33,704
Just meeting up, in and out.

84
00:06:33,829 --> 00:06:35,456
- Packing your blunderbusses?
- Hardly.

85
00:06:35,581 --> 00:06:36,956
- Right, Seth?
- Hardly. I'm with Joe.

86
00:06:37,084 --> 00:06:38,292
Just meeting up,
in and out.

87
00:06:38,418 --> 00:06:39,543
Go on.

88
00:06:44,423 --> 00:06:45,757
- Suzie.

89
00:06:45,884 --> 00:06:47,468
- Hey!

90
00:06:47,593 --> 00:06:48,886
- You working a shift tonight?

91
00:06:49,012 --> 00:06:50,178
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

92
00:06:50,305 --> 00:06:51,680
- Yeah, but a gat man

93
00:06:51,807 --> 00:06:53,307
bought me out already
for the night.

94
00:06:53,432 --> 00:06:54,516
- Oh.

95
00:06:55,644 --> 00:06:58,394
- Sweetie, I got to work.

96
00:07:07,322 --> 00:07:09,365
- Hey, Joe.

97
00:07:13,995 --> 00:07:15,704
- What?

98
00:07:15,831 --> 00:07:17,956
- Zach-- he's in there
right now with Abe.

99
00:07:18,082 --> 00:07:19,207
- For what?

100
00:07:19,334 --> 00:07:20,500
- Closed his loop.

101
00:07:20,627 --> 00:07:22,461
- No shit?

102
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:27,507
There's a
reason we're called loopers.

103
00:07:27,634 --> 00:07:30,468
When we sign up for this job,

104
00:07:30,595 --> 00:07:32,805
taking out the future's garbage,

105
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:36,516
we also agree
to a very specific proviso.

106
00:07:38,687 --> 00:07:41,312
Time travel in the future
is so illegal

107
00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:44,108
that when our employers
want to close our contracts,

108
00:07:44,233 --> 00:07:46,526
they'll also want
to erase any trace

109
00:07:46,653 --> 00:07:49,404
of their relationship
with us ever existing.

110
00:07:51,449 --> 00:07:55,119
So, if we're still alive
30 years from now,

111
00:07:55,245 --> 00:07:59,581
they'll find our older self,
zap him back to us

112
00:07:59,707 --> 00:08:03,043
and we'll kill him
like any otherjob.

113
00:08:04,629 --> 00:08:07,505
This is called closing your loop.

114
00:08:09,259 --> 00:08:12,511
You get a golden payday,
you get a handshake,

115
00:08:12,637 --> 00:08:15,055
and you get released
from your contract.

116
00:08:15,182 --> 00:08:16,764
Enjoy the next 30 years.

117
00:08:18,393 --> 00:08:20,060
This job doesn't tend to attract

118
00:08:20,187 --> 00:08:22,771
the most forward-thinking people.

119
00:08:22,898 --> 00:08:25,733
- So, we celebrating?

120
00:08:25,858 --> 00:08:28,151
- Yeah!

121
00:09:04,147 --> 00:09:05,813
- Look out!

122
00:09:12,697 --> 00:09:14,155
- Jesus.

123
00:09:14,282 --> 00:09:16,283
Fuck, Joe.

124
00:09:26,126 --> 00:09:28,419
- Ravi de te voir.

125
00:09:37,806 --> 00:09:39,682
- Bonjour, Joe.

126
00:09:39,807 --> 00:09:42,268
- Ravi de... de te voir,
Beatrix.

127
00:09:42,394 --> 00:09:44,812
- Ooh la la!

128
00:09:52,486 --> 00:09:54,488
- What's that, fourth loop
closed this month?

129
00:09:54,614 --> 00:09:55,990
- Loop closed. Here we go.

130
00:10:10,797 --> 00:10:13,006
- Loop closed, baby! Yeah!

131
00:10:44,956 --> 00:10:46,914
- Yeah.

132
00:11:00,429 --> 00:11:01,929
Seth?

133
00:11:02,057 --> 00:11:04,475
Jesus.

134
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,850
- Shh, shh.

135
00:11:05,976 --> 00:11:07,311
They're going to be here
any minute.

136
00:11:07,437 --> 00:11:08,770
Are they here?
- No. Who?

137
00:11:08,897 --> 00:11:10,730
- Oh, Christ.

138
00:11:10,856 --> 00:11:13,567
Joe, Christ.

139
00:11:13,692 --> 00:11:14,817
What are you doing?

140
00:11:14,943 --> 00:11:16,070
- Give me the gun.

141
00:11:16,196 --> 00:11:17,571
- Oh, right.
That's smart.

142
00:11:17,697 --> 00:11:18,905
- Get away from the window.

143
00:11:19,032 --> 00:11:20,115
- Christ, Joe.
- Just quiet down.

144
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,576
- You can protect me a little, right, Joe?
Just so they don't...

145
00:11:22,701 --> 00:11:24,995
- What did you do?
- Oh, geez.

146
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,331
This is like a nightmare.

147
00:11:27,456 --> 00:11:29,332
This is a nightmare.

148
00:11:29,458 --> 00:11:31,460
I knew then what he did,

149
00:11:31,586 --> 00:11:33,044
so I don't know why I asked.

150
00:11:33,171 --> 00:11:34,587
What did you do?

151
00:11:36,423 --> 00:11:40,802
- He... he was singing.

152
00:11:42,471 --> 00:11:45,724
Through the gag and sack,
but I could hear the tune.

153
00:11:47,434 --> 00:11:48,851
Deep memories.

154
00:11:48,977 --> 00:11:52,438
My mom in a dark room

155
00:11:52,565 --> 00:11:55,650
taking care of me,
singing that tune.

156
00:11:57,611 --> 00:12:02,615
Once I knew he was me...

157
00:12:06,162 --> 00:12:08,996
l... Joe, I couldn't.

158
00:12:09,124 --> 00:12:11,125
l-l couldn't.

159
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:13,710
I had to see.

160
00:12:14,796 --> 00:12:17,172
He told me...

161
00:12:17,298 --> 00:12:19,091
I remember, he told me

162
00:12:19,216 --> 00:12:23,511
there's a new holy terror
boss man in the future

163
00:12:23,638 --> 00:12:26,097
and he's closing all the loops.

164
00:12:26,224 --> 00:12:27,682
The Rainmaker,

165
00:12:27,808 --> 00:12:29,100
they call him.

166
00:12:29,226 --> 00:12:31,269
He told me it.

167
00:12:31,395 --> 00:12:33,897
And then he wanted a cigarette.

168
00:12:34,023 --> 00:12:36,232
So I untied him,

169
00:12:36,359 --> 00:12:38,693
and he gives me this look.

170
00:12:40,529 --> 00:12:43,532
And he just starts running.

171
00:12:43,658 --> 00:12:45,951
I had my blunderbuss,

172
00:12:46,076 --> 00:12:47,995
so I know I've got
about 1 5 strides

173
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,580
till he's out of my range.

174
00:12:49,706 --> 00:12:52,039
And they come, and they go.

175
00:12:53,418 --> 00:12:56,503
And I just watch him
till he's gone.

176
00:12:56,629 --> 00:12:59,505
This is
called letting your loop run.

177
00:12:59,631 --> 00:13:01,674
It's not a good thing.

178
00:13:01,801 --> 00:13:04,344
- What do I do?

179
00:13:04,471 --> 00:13:06,679
You're the only friend I got, Joe.

180
00:13:06,806 --> 00:13:08,807
You got to help me.

181
00:13:10,268 --> 00:13:12,644
- Fucking idiot coming here.

182
00:13:12,769 --> 00:13:15,772
You can't be here.
I'll give you some money.

183
00:13:15,899 --> 00:13:17,857
That's it. Then you go.
- Joe, a little money?

184
00:13:17,984 --> 00:13:19,567
Where am I going to go?

185
00:13:19,693 --> 00:13:22,070
- Hop a freight train.
You beat it the hell out of town.

186
00:13:23,447 --> 00:13:25,490
Shh.

187
00:13:28,369 --> 00:13:30,412
Just don't move.

188
00:13:31,873 --> 00:13:34,917
Tell Court
watch the window outside.

189
00:13:35,043 --> 00:13:37,668
You got it. Window.

190
00:13:37,794 --> 00:13:39,171
- Kid Blue, Joe.
Come on, now.

191
00:13:39,297 --> 00:13:40,755
Just a minute.

192
00:13:40,881 --> 00:13:42,216
Open this goddamn door.

193
00:13:42,341 --> 00:13:44,217
- I can't do anything
for you, Seth.

194
00:13:44,344 --> 00:13:45,885
- You gotta hide me.

195
00:13:46,011 --> 00:13:47,888
Please, Joe,
please, hide me.

196
00:13:48,014 --> 00:13:49,722
Please, Christ.
Please just buy me

197
00:13:49,849 --> 00:13:52,142
some time, then I'll go.
Please.

198
00:13:52,268 --> 00:13:54,394
You going to make me
bust this door down?

199
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:56,395
Yeah, hold on.

200
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,357
- Please.

201
00:13:59,484 --> 00:14:01,067
- Μove. Μove.

202
00:14:02,736 --> 00:14:04,863
Come on, Joe, open up!

203
00:14:13,206 --> 00:14:16,041
- Jesus.

204
00:14:24,384 --> 00:14:25,716
- That took a while.

205
00:14:25,842 --> 00:14:27,719
- You think it's easy
looking this good?

206
00:14:27,845 --> 00:14:29,638
- Tye's going to watch
your apartment

207
00:14:29,764 --> 00:14:32,265
while we go have
a talk with Abe.

208
00:14:32,392 --> 00:14:34,684
- There's coffee in the tin.

209
00:14:34,811 --> 00:14:36,477
- Thank you.

210
00:14:54,663 --> 00:14:57,415
Give me two minutes.

211
00:15:09,345 --> 00:15:10,971
- Know why they call that

212
00:15:11,096 --> 00:15:12,972
pea shooter of yours
a blunderbuss?

213
00:15:13,099 --> 00:15:17,852
Because it's impossible to hit
anything further than 1 5 yards.

214
00:15:17,979 --> 00:15:20,688
lmpossible to miss
anything closer.

215
00:15:20,815 --> 00:15:23,774
It's a gun for fuck-up turkeys.

216
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:25,902
Not like a gat.

217
00:15:26,946 --> 00:15:29,072
A gat has range.

218
00:15:29,197 --> 00:15:30,948
- Μmm.

219
00:15:31,075 --> 00:15:32,743
- Accuracy.

220
00:15:34,828 --> 00:15:36,203
- Kid, cut it out.

221
00:15:36,331 --> 00:15:37,748
Don't blow your other foot off.

222
00:16:02,356 --> 00:16:04,191
Jesus Christ!

223
00:16:04,317 --> 00:16:07,027
What the hell's
going on out there?

224
00:16:07,153 --> 00:16:08,903
- How you doing, Abe?
- Hey, Joe.

225
00:16:09,029 --> 00:16:11,490
You didn't shoot your other
foot off, did you, Kid?

226
00:16:11,615 --> 00:16:13,616
Fuckin' Kid...

227
00:16:14,994 --> 00:16:16,912
All right.

228
00:16:18,373 --> 00:16:20,539
Μy great-grandfather
told my grandfather,

229
00:16:20,667 --> 00:16:23,835
"Μen are like spiders.

230
00:16:23,961 --> 00:16:26,879
It's the little ones
you got to be careful of."

231
00:16:27,005 --> 00:16:29,341
- Don't know I agree with that.

232
00:16:29,466 --> 00:16:31,802
- Yeah?

233
00:16:31,927 --> 00:16:33,720
What the fuck did
my great-grandfather know?

234
00:16:35,389 --> 00:16:37,182
This man is from the future.

235
00:16:37,307 --> 00:16:39,058
He was sent back here
by the Mob,

236
00:16:39,184 --> 00:16:41,394
a one-way ticket,
to run the loopers.

237
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:44,188
That's low effort, even for Abe,
so to pass the time,

238
00:16:44,315 --> 00:16:46,524
he recruited some real muscle,
the gat men.

239
00:16:46,650 --> 00:16:48,527
Now he runs the city.

240
00:16:48,653 --> 00:16:50,821
Any other city,
that'd be impressive.

241
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:08,422
- How can you kids stand
to wear those chokers?

242
00:17:08,548 --> 00:17:09,463
Cravats.

243
00:17:09,589 --> 00:17:11,048
- Ties.
- That's ridiculous.

244
00:17:11,174 --> 00:17:13,093
You're aware we don't
have a dress code?

245
00:17:13,219 --> 00:17:14,928
- Fashion.

246
00:17:15,054 --> 00:17:16,346
- You know...
Well, you don't know.

247
00:17:16,471 --> 00:17:17,972
The movies
that you're dressing like

248
00:17:18,098 --> 00:17:19,724
are just copying other movies.

249
00:17:19,851 --> 00:17:23,894
These goddamn
20th century affectations.

250
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:25,980
Do something new. Huh?

251
00:17:26,106 --> 00:17:28,607
Put a... glowing thing

252
00:17:28,734 --> 00:17:30,818
around your neck
or use rubberized...

253
00:17:30,944 --> 00:17:32,194
Just be new.

254
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,488
- Okay.
- Yeah.

255
00:17:38,452 --> 00:17:41,496
- Well, it was nice
chatting with you, Abe.

256
00:17:41,622 --> 00:17:43,582
- I do like you, Joe.

257
00:17:43,708 --> 00:17:46,542
But we're sure enough that,
uh, Seth paid you a visit.

258
00:17:46,669 --> 00:17:48,170
We're gonna have to do
something about this.

259
00:17:48,296 --> 00:17:50,463
- Seth?
- You're expecting that we're gonna

260
00:17:50,589 --> 00:17:52,132
break your fingers with a hammer

261
00:17:52,258 --> 00:17:54,759
or something awful,
but I'm gonna

262
00:17:54,885 --> 00:17:56,260
defuse that tension right now.

263
00:17:56,386 --> 00:17:57,554
That's not gonna happen.

264
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:00,015
What is gonna happen
is that I'm gonna

265
00:18:00,141 --> 00:18:03,809
talk for a little -
not even that long -

266
00:18:03,935 --> 00:18:06,061
and then you're gonna
give up your friend.

267
00:18:06,189 --> 00:18:07,439
- Μy friend?

268
00:18:07,565 --> 00:18:09,231
Seth? Sorry, I'm...

269
00:18:09,357 --> 00:18:11,026
I'm confused.

270
00:18:11,152 --> 00:18:12,611
- Well, then I'll talk a little.

271
00:18:12,737 --> 00:18:15,404
You know, you were the youngest
looper I ever hired.

272
00:18:15,530 --> 00:18:17,990
You looked goddamn
ridiculous, they said.

273
00:18:19,535 --> 00:18:21,827
Blunderbuss up to here on you.

274
00:18:21,953 --> 00:18:24,372
I remember, they brought you
in... I forget what it was for.

275
00:18:24,499 --> 00:18:26,374
- Watch shop.
- Μm.

276
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:27,875
That's... Yeah.

277
00:18:28,001 --> 00:18:29,877
You rolled one of our fronts,
a watch shop.

278
00:18:30,003 --> 00:18:32,798
And they had you,
you know, you know,

279
00:18:32,923 --> 00:18:34,883
this kid, just like an animal.

280
00:18:35,009 --> 00:18:37,719
But you, you looked at me,
your hair stuck

281
00:18:37,845 --> 00:18:40,513
to half your face,
just one eye looking at me.

282
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,223
I could see,

283
00:18:42,349 --> 00:18:47,729
like seeing it happen on the TV,
the bad version of your life.

284
00:18:47,855 --> 00:18:52,983
Like a vision, I could see
how you'd turn bad.

285
00:18:53,109 --> 00:18:55,653
So I changed it.

286
00:18:55,779 --> 00:19:00,741
I cleaned you up
and put a gun in your hand.

287
00:19:00,867 --> 00:19:03,244
I gave you something
that was yours.

288
00:19:03,371 --> 00:19:06,163
- And I'm grateful for that, Abe.
- I gave you something

289
00:19:06,289 --> 00:19:09,709
that was yours.

290
00:19:09,836 --> 00:19:11,877
And I remember that kid.

291
00:19:13,923 --> 00:19:16,465
And I think
if you ask yourself, you ask,

292
00:19:16,634 --> 00:19:18,969
"Who would I sacrifice
for what's mine?"

293
00:19:19,095 --> 00:19:22,763
I think Seth would be
deeply cozy inside that circle.

294
00:19:24,767 --> 00:19:25,933
And I'll show you

295
00:19:26,059 --> 00:19:27,184
how much I know you.

296
00:19:28,436 --> 00:19:29,938
I'm not even gonna break you.

297
00:19:30,064 --> 00:19:32,857
I'm just gonna, you know,
set you back a ways.

298
00:19:32,983 --> 00:19:36,653
We know that you been
stashing half your bars.

299
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:38,947
Which is smart;
no law against it.

300
00:19:39,073 --> 00:19:41,365
You're gonna get out,
you're gonna go overseas, right?

301
00:19:41,491 --> 00:19:42,951
Studying up your Μandarin?

302
00:19:43,076 --> 00:19:44,618
- French.
- French?

303
00:19:46,663 --> 00:19:51,334
You give him up
or you give us half your stash.

304
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:56,172
You willing to dump your silver
in the dirt for Seth?

305
00:20:06,601 --> 00:20:08,476
- You're gonna kill him.

306
00:20:08,603 --> 00:20:11,104
- Not if we can help it.

307
00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:13,147
Be too cataclysmic a change
for the future.

308
00:20:13,273 --> 00:20:14,356
Now, what we'll do

309
00:20:14,482 --> 00:20:16,317
is dangerous in that regards,

310
00:20:16,443 --> 00:20:18,028
though not as dangerous
as killing him.

311
00:20:18,153 --> 00:20:19,528
On top of which,

312
00:20:19,654 --> 00:20:21,655
a man from the future
runs free long enough,

313
00:20:21,781 --> 00:20:25,160
you know,
this time travel shit is...

314
00:20:25,286 --> 00:20:27,037
fries your brain like an egg.

315
00:20:27,163 --> 00:20:28,579
Why the fuck French?

316
00:20:28,705 --> 00:20:31,124
- I'm going to France.

317
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:32,375
- You should go to China.

318
00:20:32,542 --> 00:20:33,876
- I'm going to France.

319
00:20:34,002 --> 00:20:35,002
- I'm from the future.

320
00:20:35,128 --> 00:20:36,503
You should go to China.

321
00:20:36,631 --> 00:20:37,923
- I'm going to France.
- You're going...

322
00:20:50,769 --> 00:20:53,855
- The floor safe, under the rug.

323
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:56,316
6-7-4-2.

324
00:21:01,739 --> 00:21:05,115
- It's the little ones that get you.

325
00:21:10,288 --> 00:21:11,998
Why don't you
kill an hour, Joe.

326
00:21:12,124 --> 00:21:14,125
On the house.

327
00:21:18,673 --> 00:21:20,673
Call the Doc.

328
00:22:57,855 --> 00:23:02,650
- Wait! Wait!

329
00:23:04,862 --> 00:23:06,738
Wait.

330
00:23:08,531 --> 00:23:09,949
Wait!

331
00:24:12,846 --> 00:24:14,721
You know, I can't
remember my mother's face.

332
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:18,643
She used to run her hands
through my hair.

333
00:24:25,025 --> 00:24:27,026
Just like this.

334
00:24:43,836 --> 00:24:47,713
I think I just let my best
friend get killed tonight.

335
00:24:47,839 --> 00:24:49,840
For silver.

336
00:24:55,847 --> 00:24:57,182
- Shit.

337
00:24:57,307 --> 00:24:59,601
- Yeah.

338
00:24:59,727 --> 00:25:01,019
Shit.

339
00:25:04,397 --> 00:25:07,066
- Sorry.

340
00:25:08,903 --> 00:25:10,819
- I'm gonna give you some money.

341
00:25:10,945 --> 00:25:12,821
I've been stashing
my silver for years,

342
00:25:12,948 --> 00:25:14,656
and I'm gonna give you half of it.

343
00:25:14,782 --> 00:25:17,660
You can raise your kid right.

344
00:25:17,786 --> 00:25:19,746
- You want to give me
half your silver?

345
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:22,164
Silver's got strings.

346
00:25:22,290 --> 00:25:25,542
I got my job.

347
00:25:25,669 --> 00:25:28,296
You got yours.

348
00:25:28,422 --> 00:25:31,924
It's sweet of you to worry
about me, but I'm doing fine.

349
00:25:33,927 --> 00:25:37,805
Why don't we just stick
to services rendered.

350
00:25:41,309 --> 00:25:43,310
ls this what you want?

351
00:27:48,186 --> 00:27:50,270
- Shit!

352
00:29:29,078 --> 00:29:31,413
Well, then it just
becomes a big ol' mess,

353
00:29:31,539 --> 00:29:32,832
like a pig fucking a football.

354
00:29:32,958 --> 00:29:34,375
You know what I'm saying?
- Uh-huh.

355
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:37,461
- Let's finish this up.

356
00:29:37,587 --> 00:29:40,131
There's 24 there.

357
00:29:40,257 --> 00:29:41,423
I'm keeping count.

358
00:29:43,719 --> 00:29:46,052
Two more trips should just do it.

359
00:30:07,451 --> 00:30:08,659
Goddamn it!

360
00:30:12,788 --> 00:30:13,788
- Listen, Kid, I'm sorry!

361
00:30:13,915 --> 00:30:15,540
Tell Abe I'm gonna fix this!

362
00:30:15,666 --> 00:30:19,211
Tell him I'm gonna find my loop
and I'm gonna kill him!

363
00:30:19,337 --> 00:30:21,588
Tell Abe...

364
00:30:21,714 --> 00:30:23,715
- Μotherfucker!

365
00:36:31,543 --> 00:36:32,960
- Shit!

366
00:36:55,775 --> 00:36:58,485
- You got any aspirin?
- Uh-huh.

367
00:36:58,612 --> 00:37:00,778
- All of them, please.

368
00:37:04,284 --> 00:37:07,077
I'll take that coat, too.

369
00:37:25,679 --> 00:37:31,851
What are you doing?

370
00:37:31,978 --> 00:37:34,103
Joe, I told you to run.

371
00:37:56,835 --> 00:38:00,047
Don't do it, you idiot.

372
00:38:04,135 --> 00:38:06,260
Hurry up, Blue!

373
00:38:06,387 --> 00:38:08,514
That's the second loop
we had run this week.

374
00:38:08,639 --> 00:38:10,056
It's getting endemic.

375
00:38:12,101 --> 00:38:13,768
- Fucking Kid Blue.

376
00:38:13,894 --> 00:38:15,521
- About two more
trips should do it.

377
00:38:15,646 --> 00:38:17,481
- Uh-huh.

378
00:38:54,018 --> 00:38:55,309
- Shit.

379
00:39:17,541 --> 00:39:19,543
You stupid little shit.

380
00:39:29,596 --> 00:39:31,804
- Pound the pavement,
sweep the train yard.

381
00:39:31,931 --> 00:39:34,391
Every second that passes is bad.

382
00:39:34,516 --> 00:39:35,851
Get on it.

383
00:39:35,976 --> 00:39:38,394
- Stupid little shit.

384
00:39:38,521 --> 00:39:40,521
- I can fix this.

385
00:39:41,815 --> 00:39:42,815
I can find him!

386
00:39:42,942 --> 00:39:43,900
- Go home.

387
00:39:44,027 --> 00:39:46,027
Let the grownups work.

388
00:39:46,153 --> 00:39:48,572
Kid Blue.

389
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:28,445
- You bastard.

390
00:40:28,570 --> 00:40:31,489
How do I find you?

391
00:42:38,784 --> 00:42:39,867
- Coffee?

392
00:42:41,329 --> 00:42:43,746
- Please.

393
00:42:43,873 --> 00:42:44,956
Black.

394
00:42:45,083 --> 00:42:46,333
And some water.

395
00:42:46,458 --> 00:42:47,458
- Anything else?

396
00:42:47,585 --> 00:42:50,045
- Are we eating?

397
00:42:50,170 --> 00:42:52,838
- I ordered something.

398
00:42:52,965 --> 00:42:54,007
- Steak and eggs,

399
00:42:54,132 --> 00:42:55,132
rare and scrambled.

400
00:42:55,260 --> 00:42:56,592
- Two steak and eggs, coming up.

401
00:43:01,724 --> 00:43:03,599
- It must hurt.

402
00:43:03,726 --> 00:43:06,143
- I wasn't sure you'd remember her.

403
00:43:06,271 --> 00:43:09,188
- Yeah, I put it together.

404
00:43:09,315 --> 00:43:10,773
Clever.

405
00:43:16,947 --> 00:43:20,992
You know, there's another girl
who works here on the weekends.

406
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:23,704
- Jen?

407
00:43:23,829 --> 00:43:24,913
- Right.

408
00:43:25,039 --> 00:43:26,789
Less letters.

409
00:43:26,916 --> 00:43:28,833
- That'd be better.

410
00:43:29,918 --> 00:43:30,835
- Pour vous.

411
00:43:30,961 --> 00:43:31,961
- Merci.

412
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:39,094
How's your French coming?

413
00:43:39,219 --> 00:43:40,929
- Good.

414
00:43:41,054 --> 00:43:43,139
You gonna tell me I ought to be
learning Μandarin?

415
00:43:43,266 --> 00:43:44,849
- I never regretted learning French.

416
00:43:48,438 --> 00:43:50,771
No?

417
00:43:50,898 --> 00:43:53,317
Well, you'll get it eventually.

418
00:43:53,443 --> 00:43:54,735
- Obviously.
- All right, listen,

419
00:43:54,860 --> 00:43:56,610
I know this is a hard
situation for you,

420
00:43:56,737 --> 00:43:58,947
but we both know
how this has to go down.

421
00:43:59,072 --> 00:44:01,199
I can't let you walk away
from this diner alive.

422
00:44:01,326 --> 00:44:02,909
This is my life now.

423
00:44:03,036 --> 00:44:04,786
I earned it.
You had yours already.

424
00:44:04,911 --> 00:44:08,081
So why don't you do
what old men do and die.

425
00:44:08,206 --> 00:44:09,708
Get the fuck out of my way.

426
00:44:09,833 --> 00:44:11,668
- Why don't you just
take your little gun out

427
00:44:11,793 --> 00:44:13,920
from between your legs and do it?

428
00:44:15,965 --> 00:44:17,465
Boy.

429
00:44:23,264 --> 00:44:25,681
It's hard staring into your eyes.

430
00:44:27,684 --> 00:44:28,851
It's too strange.

431
00:44:28,978 --> 00:44:30,603
- Your face looks backwards.

432
00:44:30,730 --> 00:44:32,898
- Yeah.

433
00:44:33,023 --> 00:44:34,648
- So do you know
what's gonna happen?

434
00:44:34,775 --> 00:44:36,360
You done all this already,
as me?

435
00:44:36,485 --> 00:44:39,028
- I don't want to talk about
time travel shit.

436
00:44:39,155 --> 00:44:41,864
'Cause if we start talking about it,
then we're gonna be here

437
00:44:41,990 --> 00:44:44,076
all day talking about it,
making diagrams with straws.

438
00:44:44,202 --> 00:44:46,327
lt doesn't matter.
- lf I hurt myself, it changes your body.

439
00:44:46,454 --> 00:44:48,246
So does what I do now
change your memories?

440
00:44:48,373 --> 00:44:51,541
Doesn't matter!

441
00:45:03,012 --> 00:45:05,722
Μy memory's cloudy.

442
00:45:05,847 --> 00:45:07,264
It's a cloud.

443
00:45:07,391 --> 00:45:10,976
'Cause my memories
aren't really memories.

444
00:45:11,103 --> 00:45:14,106
They're just one possible
eventuality now.

445
00:45:16,150 --> 00:45:18,818
And they grow clearer
or cloudier

446
00:45:18,945 --> 00:45:21,195
as they become
more or less likely.

447
00:45:21,322 --> 00:45:23,155
But then they get
to the present moment,

448
00:45:23,282 --> 00:45:25,074
and they're instantly clear again.

449
00:45:25,201 --> 00:45:28,786
I can remember what you do
after you do it.

450
00:45:32,625 --> 00:45:34,166
And it hurts.

451
00:45:34,293 --> 00:45:36,168
- So even when we're apart,

452
00:45:36,295 --> 00:45:38,838
you can remember
what I do after I do it?

453
00:45:38,965 --> 00:45:41,007
- Yes. But this is
a precise description

454
00:45:41,134 --> 00:45:43,217
of a fuzzy mechanism.

455
00:45:43,344 --> 00:45:46,179
It's- it's messy.

456
00:45:46,304 --> 00:45:48,097
All I know...
I know two things.

457
00:45:48,224 --> 00:45:50,016
I know what's happening
in my head

458
00:45:50,143 --> 00:45:52,726
and I know that
you're still gonna meet her.

459
00:45:57,065 --> 00:45:59,775
- Who?

460
00:46:04,157 --> 00:46:07,409
- She's gonna save your life.

461
00:46:11,706 --> 00:46:13,831
For a long time,

462
00:46:13,958 --> 00:46:16,333
she thought we'd, uh...

463
00:46:16,460 --> 00:46:19,045
we'd have a baby.

464
00:46:21,882 --> 00:46:24,885
She'd have been a great mother.

465
00:46:25,010 --> 00:46:27,512
She wanted it so much.

466
00:46:27,637 --> 00:46:30,306
- Yeah, but she...

467
00:46:30,432 --> 00:46:31,849
How?

468
00:46:33,268 --> 00:46:35,019
So she saves my life?

469
00:46:35,146 --> 00:46:36,271
- Yes.

470
00:46:36,396 --> 00:46:39,773
Let's take a look at your life.

471
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:42,610
You're a killer
and a junkie.

472
00:46:42,737 --> 00:46:44,320
A fucking child mentality.

473
00:46:44,447 --> 00:46:46,322
"What's mine." "Μy life."

474
00:46:46,449 --> 00:46:48,742
Save your life - you're asking
me how - the question's why.

475
00:46:48,867 --> 00:46:50,284
Why would someone
sacrifice their life?

476
00:46:50,411 --> 00:46:51,994
Why would someone waste
themselves?

477
00:46:52,121 --> 00:46:53,538
- Cut your high and mighty bullshit.

478
00:46:53,664 --> 00:46:54,831
I don't need my life saved...

479
00:46:54,956 --> 00:46:58,418
- Shut your fucking child mouth.

480
00:47:00,420 --> 00:47:02,005
You're so self-absorbed
and stupid.

481
00:47:02,130 --> 00:47:04,965
And she's gonna clean you up
and she's gonna...

482
00:47:12,807 --> 00:47:17,311
You're gonna take her love
like a sponge.

483
00:47:17,438 --> 00:47:19,563
And you think,
maybe I'm clear of the past.

484
00:47:20,900 --> 00:47:22,775
Μaybe I'm safe.

485
00:47:22,902 --> 00:47:25,737
Yesterday.

486
00:47:25,862 --> 00:47:28,239
- Yesterday what?

487
00:47:28,365 --> 00:47:29,865
- 30 years from now...

488
00:47:29,992 --> 00:47:33,494
is yesterday.

489
00:47:33,621 --> 00:47:36,789
You're not gonna remember it.

490
00:47:44,965 --> 00:47:48,260
But I'm gonna
tell you what happens

491
00:47:48,385 --> 00:47:49,844
to this beautiful woman

492
00:47:49,971 --> 00:47:52,347
who saves your worthless
fucking life.

493
00:48:35,599 --> 00:48:38,976
Have you heard of The Rainmaker?

494
00:48:39,103 --> 00:48:41,146
- Yeah.

495
00:48:41,271 --> 00:48:43,981
Seth said that night...

496
00:48:44,108 --> 00:48:47,527
New boss in the future?
He used the words "holy terror."

497
00:48:47,695 --> 00:48:48,737
- Yeah.

498
00:48:48,862 --> 00:48:50,405
A reign of terror.

499
00:48:50,530 --> 00:48:52,949
Μass executions.
Vagrant purges.

500
00:48:53,074 --> 00:48:54,284
Everywhere at once.

501
00:48:54,409 --> 00:48:57,286
Legend is The Rainmaker
came out of nowhere.

502
00:48:57,413 --> 00:48:59,204
ln the span of six months,

503
00:48:59,331 --> 00:49:01,458
took total control
of the five major syndicates.

504
00:49:01,583 --> 00:49:02,751
- That would take an army.

505
00:49:02,876 --> 00:49:04,043
- But he didn't have an army.

506
00:49:04,170 --> 00:49:07,005
Story is that he did it alone.

507
00:49:07,130 --> 00:49:08,590
Alone alone.

508
00:49:08,715 --> 00:49:10,675
- So how'd he do it?
- That's the mystery.

509
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:14,012
There's no pictures of him,
even if it is a him. It's insane.

510
00:49:14,137 --> 00:49:15,972
There's stories
he has a synthetic jaw,

511
00:49:16,097 --> 00:49:18,557
saw his mom shot,
shit like that.

512
00:49:18,726 --> 00:49:21,018
But word spread about him
through the ex-looper grapevine,

513
00:49:21,144 --> 00:49:23,938
'cause the first thing he did
was start closing loops.

514
00:49:24,065 --> 00:49:25,356
All of them.

515
00:49:29,653 --> 00:49:32,280
You know what this is?
This number?

516
00:49:32,405 --> 00:49:33,489
Dale, wait.

517
00:49:33,615 --> 00:49:34,740
- Slow down.
- It could lead us

518
00:49:34,909 --> 00:49:36,034
right to The Rainmaker, Joe!

519
00:49:36,159 --> 00:49:37,494
It's in the hospital records.

520
00:49:37,619 --> 00:49:40,871
Write this down:
zero, seven, one, five, three,

521
00:49:40,998 --> 00:49:43,500
nine, zero, two,
nine, three, five!

522
00:49:50,507 --> 00:49:54,010
This is a piece
of identifying information

523
00:49:54,135 --> 00:49:56,137
on The Rainmaker.

524
00:49:56,262 --> 00:49:57,514
He's here.

525
00:49:57,639 --> 00:49:59,516
He lives here now.

526
00:49:59,641 --> 00:50:01,559
ln this county.

527
00:50:01,686 --> 00:50:04,019
And I'm gonna use this to find him.

528
00:50:04,146 --> 00:50:06,271
And I'm gonna kill him.

529
00:50:06,398 --> 00:50:08,650
And I'm gonna stop him
from killing my wife.

530
00:50:08,775 --> 00:50:09,983
- Fuck you.

531
00:50:10,110 --> 00:50:11,235
And your wife.

532
00:50:11,362 --> 00:50:12,695
None of this concerns me.

533
00:50:12,822 --> 00:50:14,447
- This is gonna happen to you,
you stupid...!

534
00:50:14,572 --> 00:50:16,407
- It happened to you,
it doesn't have to happen to me.

535
00:50:16,534 --> 00:50:18,617
You got her picture
right there in my watch?

536
00:50:18,744 --> 00:50:20,369
Let me see it.
Show me the picture,

537
00:50:20,496 --> 00:50:22,579
and as soon as I see her,
I'll walk away.

538
00:50:22,706 --> 00:50:25,666
I'll fucking marry
someone else. Promise.

539
00:50:25,793 --> 00:50:28,670
So when I see that picture,
that fog inside your brain

540
00:50:28,795 --> 00:50:30,922
should just swallow up
all the memories, right?

541
00:50:31,047 --> 00:50:32,923
She'll be gone.

542
00:50:33,050 --> 00:50:34,884
lf you give her up,
she'll be safe.

543
00:50:35,010 --> 00:50:36,677
- Give her up?

544
00:50:36,804 --> 00:50:38,722
- Yeah, give her up; you're
the one that got her killed.

545
00:50:38,847 --> 00:50:40,347
lf she never meets you,
she's safe.

546
00:50:40,474 --> 00:50:41,474
- You don't understand.

547
00:50:41,599 --> 00:50:43,268
We don't have to give her up.

548
00:50:43,393 --> 00:50:44,728
I'm not gonna give her up.

549
00:50:44,853 --> 00:50:47,438
I'm gonna save her.

550
00:51:00,536 --> 00:51:02,746
Get to the fields.

551
00:51:02,871 --> 00:51:04,789
We can lose them in the fields.

552
00:51:05,916 --> 00:51:06,791
Hop a train.

553
00:51:06,916 --> 00:51:09,878
Stay out of town!

554
00:51:33,277 --> 00:51:35,527
- What the hell is everybody doing?!

555
00:51:35,653 --> 00:51:37,614
You wait for my signal!

556
00:51:37,739 --> 00:51:39,364
- Out back!
He's running!

557
00:51:39,492 --> 00:51:40,574
- He ran out back!

558
00:51:50,795 --> 00:51:52,795
- Shit!

559
00:51:58,802 --> 00:52:00,427
- Alive!

560
00:52:06,976 --> 00:52:08,186
- Fuck! Shit! Come on!

561
00:52:08,311 --> 00:52:09,521
Come on!

562
00:52:09,646 --> 00:52:10,813
Come on, you piece of shit!

563
00:52:10,940 --> 00:52:12,606
Come on! Come on!

564
00:52:21,199 --> 00:52:22,199
- Get the tracker!

565
00:52:22,326 --> 00:52:23,576
The tracker!
- Go! Go!

566
00:52:23,702 --> 00:52:27,079
- Fuck! Fuck!

567
00:52:27,206 --> 00:52:29,206
Shit.

568
00:54:10,601 --> 00:54:12,559
- Come on, baby.

569
00:54:12,686 --> 00:54:15,313
Time to get up.

570
00:54:55,269 --> 00:54:57,396
Listen up, fucker!

571
00:54:57,523 --> 00:55:03,277
I have shot and buried
three vagrants in the past year!

572
00:55:03,403 --> 00:55:07,239
So I don't care
what hobo sob story you got.

573
00:55:07,365 --> 00:55:08,992
I get a dozen a week, pal.

574
00:55:09,117 --> 00:55:10,994
lt cuts no cash with me.

575
00:55:11,119 --> 00:55:13,246
But if you show your face
here again,

576
00:55:13,371 --> 00:55:16,373
I will cut you the fuck in half!

577
00:55:57,498 --> 00:56:01,543
- Well... you found him.

578
00:56:01,670 --> 00:56:05,630
Tracking Seth's bike,
that was clever.

579
00:56:05,757 --> 00:56:08,885
Then you rustled up a posse
and went out to get him.

580
00:56:09,010 --> 00:56:10,219
- I could do it again.

581
00:56:10,344 --> 00:56:12,472
- You can fuck up again? Really?

582
00:56:12,597 --> 00:56:15,057
I got too much riding, Kid.

583
00:56:15,184 --> 00:56:19,061
I can't afford
a fuck-up playing cowboy.

584
00:56:19,188 --> 00:56:21,813
Put your gat on the table.

585
00:56:39,958 --> 00:56:42,710
- I wanted you to say I did good.

586
00:56:44,545 --> 00:56:46,797
That's all I wanted.

587
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:50,802
This is all I have.

588
00:56:59,018 --> 00:57:00,894
Please just give me
one more chance.

589
00:57:01,021 --> 00:57:02,771
I'll bring him here alive

590
00:57:02,898 --> 00:57:04,565
and hold him.

591
00:57:04,690 --> 00:57:06,818
And you can put a bullet
in his brain yourself.

592
00:57:09,278 --> 00:57:10,612
No!

593
00:58:08,547 --> 00:58:10,547
- Hey, who's there?

594
00:58:15,429 --> 00:58:16,846
Stop right there.

595
00:58:16,972 --> 00:58:19,764
I will shoot you.

596
00:58:22,643 --> 00:58:24,228
You stop! Stop right there!

597
00:58:26,315 --> 00:58:29,025
I'm telling you to stop!

598
00:58:29,150 --> 00:58:30,693
You stop!

599
00:59:02,516 --> 00:59:03,684
- That's painful.

600
00:59:03,809 --> 00:59:06,103
Μy head.
- Hey.

601
00:59:06,230 --> 00:59:07,938
Look up at the light.

602
00:59:08,065 --> 00:59:09,273
Look up at me.

603
00:59:09,398 --> 00:59:10,523
How long since you dropped?

604
00:59:10,650 --> 00:59:12,108
- Dropped?
- Dropped.

605
00:59:12,235 --> 00:59:14,362
- A day.

606
00:59:14,487 --> 00:59:16,572
- A day. Wow.
- I can't feel my legs.

607
00:59:16,697 --> 00:59:18,282
- That's 'cause you're going
through withdrawal,

608
00:59:18,407 --> 00:59:19,532
you fucking junkie.

609
00:59:19,659 --> 00:59:20,784
- You got to help me.

610
00:59:20,911 --> 00:59:22,494
I'm going to die.

611
00:59:23,914 --> 00:59:27,041
I'm thirsty. Water.

612
00:59:27,166 --> 00:59:28,918
Water!

613
00:59:44,976 --> 00:59:47,228
Thirsty...

614
01:00:00,409 --> 01:00:02,492
Cid.

615
01:00:02,619 --> 01:00:05,329
Come inside, baby.

616
01:00:06,706 --> 01:00:07,914
- Who is that man?

617
01:00:08,041 --> 01:00:09,166
- He's just a vagrant, baby.

618
01:00:09,293 --> 01:00:10,418
- No, he's not.

619
01:00:10,543 --> 01:00:11,668
- Oh, yeah?

620
01:00:11,795 --> 01:00:13,670
- His shoes are too shiny.

621
01:00:13,797 --> 01:00:16,047
- Well, aren't you
a smart monkey.

622
01:00:16,173 --> 01:00:17,507
- ls he sick?

623
01:00:17,634 --> 01:00:18,759
- Yep.

624
01:00:18,885 --> 01:00:20,052
- Will he get better?

625
01:00:20,177 --> 01:00:21,304
- Yeah.

626
01:00:21,429 --> 01:00:22,596
- Promise?

627
01:00:22,722 --> 01:00:25,141
- Just go to sleep,
okay, baby boy?

628
01:00:29,103 --> 01:00:30,730
Night, sweetie.

629
01:00:30,856 --> 01:00:32,856
- Night, Sara.

630
01:01:09,393 --> 01:01:10,393
- Hey.

631
01:01:20,155 --> 01:01:22,405
- The first time I saw her face.

632
01:01:22,532 --> 01:01:24,115
The first time I saw her face.

633
01:01:24,242 --> 01:01:25,242
- Look at me.

634
01:01:26,327 --> 01:01:27,536
- No.

635
01:01:27,661 --> 01:01:30,289
The first time I saw her face.

636
01:01:31,458 --> 01:01:33,626
The first time I saw her face.

637
01:01:33,751 --> 01:01:35,126
The first time I saw your face.

638
01:01:35,253 --> 01:01:37,505
The first time I saw her face.

639
01:02:18,797 --> 01:02:20,588
- Μorning, monkey.

640
01:02:20,715 --> 01:02:22,675
Do you want something to eat?

641
01:02:22,800 --> 01:02:24,802
- The man's up.

642
01:02:24,927 --> 01:02:27,346
ls he staying here now?

643
01:02:27,472 --> 01:02:29,389
- No.

644
01:02:34,938 --> 01:02:36,938
Toss it.

645
01:02:37,065 --> 01:02:38,940
- I'm about to finish cleaning...

646
01:02:39,067 --> 01:02:41,068
- Put it down.

647
01:02:42,778 --> 01:02:44,655
How are you feeling?

648
01:02:44,780 --> 01:02:46,865
- I'd say I'm at 30% .

649
01:02:46,992 --> 01:02:49,492
- You take it slow, by the end
of the week, you'll be at 50.

650
01:02:51,788 --> 01:02:54,123
So I took you in
so you wouldn't die.

651
01:02:54,248 --> 01:02:56,833
Now you're not going to die,
so just take the morning to rest,

652
01:02:56,960 --> 01:02:58,543
then you need to get off my farm.

653
01:02:58,670 --> 01:03:00,378
- I can't do that.
- I'm sorry?

654
01:03:00,505 --> 01:03:02,505
- I got to stay here for a little while.

655
01:03:02,673 --> 01:03:04,507
- I'm not cool with that.
- I'm sorry.

656
01:03:04,634 --> 01:03:06,050
- Well, I'm sorry, too.
You just lost

657
01:03:06,177 --> 01:03:07,635
your "take the morning
to rest" privileges.

658
01:03:07,762 --> 01:03:09,304
Get off my farm.
- No.

659
01:03:09,431 --> 01:03:11,347
- Get off my farm.

660
01:03:11,474 --> 01:03:13,141
- You couldn't scare
a retarded hobo

661
01:03:13,268 --> 01:03:14,559
with that thing... literally.

662
01:03:14,686 --> 01:03:17,480
- This is a Remington 870.
One blast could cut you the fuck in half.

663
01:03:17,606 --> 01:03:20,483
- "Fuck in half." Yeah, that's telling.
You're holding a gun.

664
01:03:20,608 --> 01:03:23,027
I say I'm not afraid,
so you describe the gun to me.

665
01:03:23,152 --> 01:03:24,612
It's not the gun
I'm not afraid of.

666
01:03:24,737 --> 01:03:28,239
What are you going to do, shoot in the air?
Try to scare me? Go ahead.

667
01:03:28,365 --> 01:03:30,326
You wouldn't let me die,
you're not going to kill me.

668
01:03:30,452 --> 01:03:31,994
- So now I saved your life,
that makes me weak?

669
01:03:32,119 --> 01:03:34,579
- Look, I'm not a threat
to you or your boy.

670
01:03:34,706 --> 01:03:37,541
I need to be on your property.
I'd rather there's no contact at all.

671
01:03:37,666 --> 01:03:39,376
I'm going to stay in the fields.

672
01:03:39,503 --> 01:03:41,003
There's just one thing
I need you to do,

673
01:03:41,128 --> 01:03:42,505
then you'll never have
to deal with me again.

674
01:03:42,630 --> 01:03:44,797
Just verify for me this
is your house on the map

675
01:03:44,925 --> 01:03:47,510
so I know I'm in the right place.
- What's this?

676
01:03:47,635 --> 01:03:49,135
- It's a map.
- Yeah, that's my house.

677
01:03:49,262 --> 01:03:52,056
Why is it marked?
- Okay, doesn't matter.

678
01:03:52,181 --> 01:03:55,016
Look, I'm going to be out
of the barn in an hour.

679
01:03:55,143 --> 01:03:57,101
lf you can spare it,
I'm going to take this canteen.

680
01:03:57,228 --> 01:03:58,978
ls there somewhere I can
fill it up with water?

681
01:03:59,105 --> 01:04:00,563
- This number...
how did you get this?

682
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:04,150
- That mean something to you?

683
01:04:05,320 --> 01:04:07,362
What? Hey. Hey.

684
01:04:07,489 --> 01:04:08,822
Hey!

685
01:04:22,336 --> 01:04:24,672
- Yeah, you're right:
I'm not a killer.

686
01:04:24,797 --> 01:04:26,130
But I'm fine with how a blast

687
01:04:26,257 --> 01:04:28,007
of rock salt to your face
won't kill you.

688
01:04:28,134 --> 01:04:31,427
Now, you're going
to tell me who you are

689
01:04:31,554 --> 01:04:33,722
and what the fuck
you're doing on my farm.

690
01:04:33,847 --> 01:04:36,224
- Okay. Okay.

691
01:04:38,311 --> 01:04:40,853
Time travel
hasn't been invented yet,

692
01:04:40,981 --> 01:04:43,190
but in 30 years, it will have been.

693
01:04:43,315 --> 01:04:44,525
It's going to be used

694
01:04:44,650 --> 01:04:45,900
by these big criminal syndicates...

695
01:04:46,027 --> 01:04:47,820
- You're a looper?

696
01:05:00,875 --> 01:05:03,043
- I can't go back to the city
'cause Abe, the boss,

697
01:05:03,168 --> 01:05:07,255
his men will be searching for me 24/7
till they find me or find him.

698
01:05:07,382 --> 01:05:09,007
All I got's that map.

699
01:05:09,134 --> 01:05:10,967
He had three houses
marked on it,

700
01:05:11,135 --> 01:05:13,012
and yours is one of them.

701
01:05:13,137 --> 01:05:15,681
I know he's coming here.

702
01:05:15,806 --> 01:05:17,432
So, what,
you know about loopers?

703
01:05:17,559 --> 01:05:18,891
You know what we do?

704
01:05:19,018 --> 01:05:21,061
- So he's coming here

705
01:05:21,186 --> 01:05:23,731
to murder my son,
'cause he thinks he might

706
01:05:23,856 --> 01:05:25,815
be this Rainmaker?

707
01:05:25,942 --> 01:05:27,650
And once he kills

708
01:05:27,777 --> 01:05:29,945
the Rainmaker, what happens?

709
01:05:30,070 --> 01:05:31,989
- I think he thinks,
if he killed the Rainmaker,

710
01:05:32,114 --> 01:05:33,824
then he never
would have been sent back,

711
01:05:33,949 --> 01:05:35,534
so he'd just vanish.

712
01:05:35,659 --> 01:05:38,077
He'd disappear
just like he appeared.

713
01:05:39,246 --> 01:05:41,373
He'd be back with his wife.

714
01:05:43,043 --> 01:05:46,170
Who is he,
this guy you let run?

715
01:05:46,295 --> 01:05:48,422
ls he just some random guy
from the future?

716
01:05:48,547 --> 01:05:49,672
- Yeah, just...
he's just somebody.

717
01:05:49,798 --> 01:05:51,090
You know what the numbers mean?

718
01:05:55,429 --> 01:05:57,306
- This is Cid's birthday,

719
01:05:57,431 --> 01:06:00,601
and this is the med code
of the hospital he was born in.

720
01:06:06,231 --> 01:06:07,608
How many other kids

721
01:06:07,733 --> 01:06:09,400
were born in that hospital
on that day

722
01:06:09,527 --> 01:06:10,652
with your son?

723
01:06:10,778 --> 01:06:12,320
Like, two?
- Sounds right.

724
01:06:12,447 --> 01:06:14,280
- Three kids, three houses

725
01:06:14,407 --> 01:06:15,532
marked on his map.

726
01:06:15,659 --> 01:06:17,242
He knows one of them
is the Rainmaker.

727
01:06:17,369 --> 01:06:18,827
He doesn't know which.

728
01:06:18,952 --> 01:06:21,121
- What's he going to do?

729
01:06:21,246 --> 01:06:23,748
- Oh, God.

730
01:08:11,940 --> 01:08:14,193
- Can he really do this?

731
01:08:14,318 --> 01:08:15,610
- Think about what
doing this would fix.

732
01:08:15,737 --> 01:08:17,988
What he thinks it would fix.

733
01:08:22,202 --> 01:08:25,328
- lf he comes here,
will you stop him?

734
01:08:27,957 --> 01:08:30,042
I'm asking, can I trust you?

735
01:08:30,167 --> 01:08:33,545
- I don't care if you trust me.
I don't care about your son.

736
01:08:33,671 --> 01:08:34,796
I lost my life.

737
01:08:34,922 --> 01:08:37,090
I kill this man, I get it back.

738
01:08:41,095 --> 01:08:43,596
He'll kill the other
two kids and come here last.

739
01:08:43,722 --> 01:08:46,015
Put off facing me.

740
01:08:46,141 --> 01:08:48,976
All this goddamn cane
leaves us blind.

741
01:08:49,103 --> 01:08:51,479
He can get within
50 yards of this place

742
01:08:51,605 --> 01:08:53,981
without a hawk spotting him.

743
01:08:54,108 --> 01:08:56,275
What makes sense is we
burn the fields, level them.

744
01:08:56,402 --> 01:08:59,279
How much gas you got
in that barn?

745
01:08:59,404 --> 01:09:01,989
- No, you can't burn down
my cane fields.

746
01:09:02,115 --> 01:09:03,826
- This stuff's half dead anyway.

747
01:09:03,952 --> 01:09:06,161
- Yeah, it's the seed for next year.

748
01:09:06,287 --> 01:09:09,539
It's not going to happen,
you fucking nut.

749
01:09:14,753 --> 01:09:17,631
Listen, you use what you need
and you set up anywhere,

750
01:09:17,756 --> 01:09:20,132
but one thing... I don't
want you talking to Cid.

751
01:09:20,260 --> 01:09:22,051
I watch my son;
you watch the cane.

752
01:09:22,177 --> 01:09:23,302
That's the deal.

753
01:09:23,429 --> 01:09:24,555
- Good by me.

754
01:09:24,680 --> 01:09:26,139
- Fine.

755
01:09:26,265 --> 01:09:28,432
All right, hold still.

756
01:09:30,103 --> 01:09:33,020
It's easy for things
to get infected on a farm,

757
01:09:33,146 --> 01:09:35,189
start falling off.

758
01:09:37,025 --> 01:09:38,277
Pussy.

759
01:09:40,779 --> 01:09:43,573
- lf I'm going to be out here
and you're in the house,

760
01:09:43,699 --> 01:09:45,367
we need a way to communicate.

761
01:09:45,493 --> 01:09:47,368
- There's a dinner bell in the barn.

762
01:09:47,494 --> 01:09:48,912
You can ring that
if someone's coming.

763
01:09:49,037 --> 01:09:50,372
I'll hear it.
- Not a dinner bell.

764
01:09:50,497 --> 01:09:53,625
We need buzzers
or walkies or something.

765
01:09:53,751 --> 01:09:55,918
- I don't know what we got,
but I'll look.

766
01:09:56,045 --> 01:09:57,962
Cid.

767
01:10:00,216 --> 01:10:01,716
How's the math coming?

768
01:10:01,842 --> 01:10:03,051
- I want to help the man.

769
01:10:03,176 --> 01:10:04,302
- Help him with what?

770
01:10:04,429 --> 01:10:06,305
- I could help him with my toys.

771
01:10:06,430 --> 01:10:08,306
- No. Let me talk to you.

772
01:10:08,432 --> 01:10:11,435
I need you to stay away
from that man, okay?

773
01:10:11,560 --> 01:10:14,104
You just let him do his thing,
but you stick with me, okay?

774
01:10:14,229 --> 01:10:16,148
- ls he not good?

775
01:10:16,274 --> 01:10:18,774
- Well, we're going
to see what he is.

776
01:10:18,902 --> 01:10:21,485
All right? But I need you
to stick with me.

777
01:10:21,613 --> 01:10:23,738
Good boy.

778
01:10:57,273 --> 01:10:59,274
- Shh.

779
01:11:11,621 --> 01:11:13,997
Hand me that Phillips.

780
01:11:17,585 --> 01:11:19,252
Tell me if you hear her coming.

781
01:11:19,378 --> 01:11:21,337
- What are we doing here?

782
01:11:21,463 --> 01:11:23,256
- Communication.

783
01:11:25,760 --> 01:11:28,220
But I need to make it stronger.

784
01:11:28,345 --> 01:11:29,805
- And how do we do that?

785
01:11:29,930 --> 01:11:31,139
- Bigger battery.

786
01:11:31,265 --> 01:11:33,475
- Smart.

787
01:11:35,353 --> 01:11:38,145
- Do you kill people?

788
01:11:42,025 --> 01:11:43,402
- Uh...

789
01:11:43,528 --> 01:11:45,569
let's say I kill people.

790
01:11:45,697 --> 01:11:47,948
- With your gun?

791
01:11:48,073 --> 01:11:50,199
- Uh-huh.

792
01:11:51,368 --> 01:11:52,994
What, you want a gun like mine?

793
01:11:53,121 --> 01:11:54,287
- Yeah.
- What are you

794
01:11:54,413 --> 01:11:57,832
going to do with it, pole-vaulting?
It's bigger than you.

795
01:11:59,668 --> 01:12:02,087
- Stop bad things from happening.

796
01:12:03,881 --> 01:12:05,841
Shit.

797
01:12:20,230 --> 01:12:23,984
So, um, how long you and your mom
been out here on the farm?

798
01:12:24,109 --> 01:12:26,278
- She's not.

799
01:12:26,404 --> 01:12:28,738
- She's not what?

800
01:12:28,864 --> 01:12:33,534
- Sara doesn't know,
but I remember my real mom.

801
01:12:34,619 --> 01:12:37,247
When I was a baby,

802
01:12:37,372 --> 01:12:40,125
I couldn't stop it.

803
01:12:40,251 --> 01:12:42,210
- Couldn't stop what?

804
01:12:42,336 --> 01:12:46,088
- I couldn't stop her
from getting killed.

805
01:12:46,215 --> 01:12:47,591
I saw it,

806
01:12:47,716 --> 01:12:50,342
but I couldn't stop it.

807
01:12:50,470 --> 01:12:53,930
I wasn't strong enough.

808
01:12:55,349 --> 01:12:57,600
- You should, uh...

809
01:12:57,726 --> 01:12:59,728
you should talk
to your mom about this.

810
01:12:59,854 --> 01:13:01,688
- She's not my mom.

811
01:13:01,814 --> 01:13:04,774
She's a liar.

812
01:13:17,829 --> 01:13:20,207
- Spotted him coming out of
a sewer tunnel on the west end.

813
01:13:20,332 --> 01:13:22,292
He's on the run.

814
01:13:33,970 --> 01:13:35,221
Think he's heading

815
01:13:35,347 --> 01:13:36,972
to the west on Talbott Street,

816
01:13:37,100 --> 01:13:38,682
possibly to Whore's Alley.

817
01:13:38,810 --> 01:13:40,310
We have a visual.

818
01:13:43,189 --> 01:13:46,983
- You can't take that thing out
with a plow or something?

819
01:13:47,109 --> 01:13:49,485
- Uh-huh.

820
01:13:49,612 --> 01:13:52,488
- Listen, I found a, uh...

821
01:13:53,949 --> 01:13:55,492
ln the barn, I found some parts,

822
01:13:55,618 --> 01:13:58,119
and I made a... a thing.

823
01:13:58,246 --> 01:14:00,162
Here.

824
01:14:02,416 --> 01:14:04,376
So, if you see something,
just push that.

825
01:14:05,877 --> 01:14:07,878
- When?

826
01:14:09,422 --> 01:14:10,756
- Last night, he woke me up.

827
01:14:10,882 --> 01:14:12,509
Don't tell him I told you.
He didn't...

828
01:14:18,265 --> 01:14:20,725
You said you were his mom.

829
01:14:20,851 --> 01:14:22,394
- Yeah.

830
01:14:23,479 --> 01:14:25,771
- He told me you're not.

831
01:14:27,233 --> 01:14:29,818
- He said that?

832
01:14:29,944 --> 01:14:31,528
- Yeah.

833
01:14:31,654 --> 01:14:34,197
lf he's not your son,
who is he?

834
01:14:34,323 --> 01:14:36,323
- He's my son.

835
01:14:38,243 --> 01:14:40,328
I had Cid when I was 22.

836
01:14:40,453 --> 01:14:43,957
But I didn't want to give up
my life in the city,

837
01:14:44,082 --> 01:14:47,627
so I dropped him here
on the farm with my sister,

838
01:14:47,752 --> 01:14:51,715
and she saw how I was living,
so she took him.

839
01:14:51,841 --> 01:14:55,594
And my sister, she raised him.

840
01:14:57,220 --> 01:14:59,096
She loved him.

841
01:14:59,222 --> 01:15:01,349
He called her Μom.

842
01:15:07,064 --> 01:15:09,024
- How did she get killed?

843
01:15:09,149 --> 01:15:10,274
- Jesus Christ.

844
01:15:10,400 --> 01:15:12,985
- He remembers it.
You got to talk to him about it.

845
01:15:13,112 --> 01:15:14,237
- I told you one thing.

846
01:15:14,363 --> 01:15:16,573
I told you to stay away
from my son.

847
01:15:16,698 --> 01:15:18,658
- He asked about my gun.
- Stay out of it!

848
01:15:19,952 --> 01:15:21,744
And stay the fuck away
from my son.

849
01:15:24,664 --> 01:15:28,501
Where does 56 go?

850
01:15:29,670 --> 01:15:30,878
Oh, good.

851
01:15:31,005 --> 01:15:32,380
You're smart.

852
01:15:32,506 --> 01:15:33,797
Twenty-one?

853
01:15:33,925 --> 01:15:36,091
- How long can you not sleep?

854
01:15:36,260 --> 01:15:37,385
- I don't know.

855
01:15:37,511 --> 01:15:38,636
Probably a while.

856
01:15:38,762 --> 01:15:40,055
It's a good question.

857
01:15:40,180 --> 01:15:42,181
Where does it go?
Come on.

858
01:15:43,350 --> 01:15:45,310
Good.

859
01:15:45,435 --> 01:15:46,936
Thirty-two?

860
01:15:47,063 --> 01:15:48,854
- You should help Joe watch.

861
01:15:48,980 --> 01:15:50,481
- Joe?

862
01:15:50,608 --> 01:15:53,109
- Because he can't stay
awake all the time.

863
01:15:53,277 --> 01:15:54,778
- He isn't our business, okay?

864
01:15:54,904 --> 01:15:56,445
- He's keeping us safe.

865
01:15:56,572 --> 01:15:57,738
- Let's do this now, okay?

866
01:15:57,864 --> 01:15:59,323
You have 32 there.

867
01:15:59,449 --> 01:16:01,201
I know you know this one.

868
01:16:03,787 --> 01:16:05,497
No.
Eight times three is what?

869
01:16:05,622 --> 01:16:07,207
- Thirty-two.

870
01:16:07,332 --> 01:16:08,500
- Eight times three is what?

871
01:16:08,626 --> 01:16:11,127
- Thirty-two.

872
01:16:14,256 --> 01:16:15,756
- I want you to count three eights.

873
01:16:15,882 --> 01:16:17,300
- Eight.

874
01:16:17,426 --> 01:16:19,594
Sixteen.

875
01:16:20,971 --> 01:16:23,640
Thirty-two.
- Are you telling me you want alone time?

876
01:16:23,765 --> 01:16:25,600
- No.
- Then why don't you put that

877
01:16:25,725 --> 01:16:27,726
where it belongs?

878
01:16:33,234 --> 01:16:34,775
Alone time.

879
01:16:34,902 --> 01:16:36,735
- He's protecting us
'cause you can't do it.

880
01:16:36,862 --> 01:16:39,613
- Okay, I told you to stay away
from him, didn't l?

881
01:16:39,739 --> 01:16:40,948
- I never did anything.

882
01:16:41,074 --> 01:16:42,283
- Do you think I'm stupid?

883
01:16:42,409 --> 01:16:44,703
- So.
- I told you already...

884
01:16:44,828 --> 01:16:46,871
-So!
- You do what I tell you, Cid!

885
01:16:46,997 --> 01:16:50,250
- You can't tell me what to do,
'cause you're not my mom!

886
01:16:50,376 --> 01:16:52,418
You're not my mom!
You're a liar!

887
01:16:52,545 --> 01:16:54,878
You're going to get killed
'cause you won't stop lying.

888
01:16:55,006 --> 01:16:56,422
- Cid, calm down.
- Liar! You're lying to me!

889
01:16:56,548 --> 01:16:57,881
I hate you! Liar!

890
01:16:58,009 --> 01:17:00,176
You're lying to me!
I hate you! Liar!

891
01:17:00,302 --> 01:17:01,594
- Cid, calm down.
- I hate you! Liar!

892
01:17:01,720 --> 01:17:02,970
- Shh. Calm down.
- You're lying to me!

893
01:17:03,096 --> 01:17:05,681
I hate you! Liar!

894
01:17:19,738 --> 01:17:21,698
Liar!

895
01:17:21,823 --> 01:17:24,783
Liar...!

896
01:17:24,909 --> 01:17:27,037
You're not my mom!

897
01:17:27,162 --> 01:17:28,747
You're a liar!

898
01:17:33,793 --> 01:17:35,878
You're not my mom!

899
01:17:36,005 --> 01:17:38,672
I hate you! Liar!

900
01:17:38,798 --> 01:17:42,217
Cid: Liar! Liar!

901
01:18:14,251 --> 01:18:16,586
I'm sorry.

902
01:18:18,797 --> 01:18:22,050
- It's okay, sweetie.

903
01:19:08,055 --> 01:19:10,722
- Holy shit.

904
01:19:16,020 --> 01:19:17,396
Welcome. Let me know.

905
01:20:02,568 --> 01:20:04,444
- Evening, ma'am.

906
01:20:04,569 --> 01:20:07,197
- Evening.

907
01:20:07,323 --> 01:20:08,363
How can I help you?

908
01:20:10,242 --> 01:20:13,368
- You can start by accepting
my apologies "r-e:" the hour.

909
01:20:13,496 --> 01:20:16,247
Hope I didn't catch you at supper.
- No, that's fine.

910
01:20:16,372 --> 01:20:18,291
- I been walking between empty
farms all day in the hot sun.

911
01:20:18,417 --> 01:20:21,002
Thought I'd just
tick this one off the list,

912
01:20:21,127 --> 01:20:22,462
not have to come back tomorrow.

913
01:20:22,587 --> 01:20:24,881
- What's this about?

914
01:20:25,006 --> 01:20:26,925
- You alone here, ma'am?

915
01:20:27,051 --> 01:20:28,967
- Μy husband should be back
from the city any time now.

916
01:20:29,094 --> 01:20:30,929
- Happy to hear it.
- Μm-hmm.

917
01:20:32,680 --> 01:20:35,807
- Could I trouble you for some water?

918
01:20:35,935 --> 01:20:38,895
- I'll get you some.
You can take the glass with you.

919
01:20:40,396 --> 01:20:44,484
- Actually, ma'am,
my business today, this...

920
01:20:44,609 --> 01:20:47,069
ticking off the list business
is gonna require me

921
01:20:47,195 --> 01:20:49,572
coming in, if that's all right.

922
01:20:49,698 --> 01:20:52,824
- Will you tell me what this is about?
- I will, yes.

923
01:20:55,912 --> 01:20:58,622
Can I come in?

924
01:21:00,917 --> 01:21:03,211
Μa'am?

925
01:21:10,552 --> 01:21:12,427
I'm a deputized police officer,

926
01:21:12,555 --> 01:21:15,390
looking for an escaped criminal.

927
01:21:15,515 --> 01:21:18,518
Anyone through here these
past two days? Vagrants?

928
01:21:18,644 --> 01:21:19,935
Vagrants are
always passing here,

929
01:21:20,061 --> 01:21:21,311
but nobody near the house.

930
01:21:21,438 --> 01:21:23,689
That man there?

931
01:21:23,815 --> 01:21:25,733
- He's young. No.

932
01:21:25,859 --> 01:21:27,234
- We're looking for his father, too.

933
01:21:27,360 --> 01:21:28,778
Similar looking build,

934
01:21:28,904 --> 01:21:32,155
late 50s, may or may not
be traveling together.

935
01:21:34,158 --> 01:21:36,034
Do you recognize them?

936
01:21:36,161 --> 01:21:37,996
- No.

937
01:21:38,122 --> 01:21:39,956
Keep them.

938
01:21:41,958 --> 01:21:45,502
Your kids with your husband?

939
01:21:45,628 --> 01:21:47,421
- Yeah, just one.

940
01:21:47,547 --> 01:21:48,922
- How old?

941
01:21:49,048 --> 01:21:50,716
- Ten.

942
01:22:11,904 --> 01:22:13,864
I'm gonna show you the barn

943
01:22:13,990 --> 01:22:16,242
and then the house, and then
you can be on your way.

944
01:22:16,368 --> 01:22:18,118
- I took the liberty with your barn.

945
01:22:18,244 --> 01:22:20,997
Apologies.

946
01:22:21,122 --> 01:22:24,333
So, the house.

947
01:22:39,015 --> 01:22:40,140
Ten, you said?

948
01:22:40,266 --> 01:22:41,516
Your boy?
- Yeah.

949
01:22:41,644 --> 01:22:42,560
- And your husband?

950
01:22:42,685 --> 01:22:43,895
- Μm-hmm.

951
01:22:44,020 --> 01:22:47,023
- I just got to check in
with the home office.

952
01:22:49,525 --> 01:22:51,610
You said the boy's
in the city with his father.

953
01:22:51,737 --> 01:22:52,694
When they getting back?

954
01:22:52,820 --> 01:22:55,573
Couldn't tell you.

955
01:22:57,618 --> 01:22:59,452
Ah!

956
01:22:59,578 --> 01:23:02,246
This goddamn thing.

957
01:23:02,372 --> 01:23:03,622
I can never get a signal

958
01:23:03,748 --> 01:23:06,042
this far out of town.

959
01:23:07,543 --> 01:23:09,045
Ah, piece of shit.

960
01:23:15,051 --> 01:23:16,301
Okay.

961
01:23:16,427 --> 01:23:18,054
Here we go.

962
01:23:18,180 --> 01:23:20,222
- ls this man dangerous?

963
01:23:20,349 --> 01:23:23,266
- He shoots men down for a living.

964
01:23:23,394 --> 01:23:24,851
He's a stone-cold killer.

965
01:23:24,978 --> 01:23:27,896
Μy boss has half the city
looking for him.

966
01:23:28,023 --> 01:23:30,565
Half the city and me, so...

967
01:23:30,693 --> 01:23:33,152
And if you find him,
there's a hell of a price.

968
01:23:33,278 --> 01:23:36,863
Chunk of money like that,
you should think on it.

969
01:23:36,989 --> 01:23:39,492
- I will.
- All right.

970
01:23:39,534 --> 01:23:40,534
Show me upstairs.

971
01:23:42,912 --> 01:23:45,664
- There's drafts in the house.

972
01:24:05,519 --> 01:24:08,688
- Μy granddad built this tunnel
when the vagrant raids got bad.

973
01:24:08,814 --> 01:24:11,023
Nana said he was nuts.

974
01:24:11,149 --> 01:24:12,358
- Thank you, granddad.

975
01:24:12,484 --> 01:24:14,025
- That wasn't the man.

976
01:24:14,153 --> 01:24:15,444
- No.

977
01:24:15,570 --> 01:24:16,988
It's funny,
I know that guy, though.

978
01:24:17,113 --> 01:24:18,780
His name is Jesse.

979
01:24:18,907 --> 01:24:21,993
I like him. He's good.

980
01:24:22,118 --> 01:24:24,619
He's gonna go away
once he doesn't find me.

981
01:24:24,747 --> 01:24:26,706
He won't hurt your mom.

982
01:24:26,832 --> 01:24:27,832
Um, Sara.

983
01:24:27,957 --> 01:24:30,126
- Where's your mom?

984
01:24:30,252 --> 01:24:33,128
- Where's my mom?

985
01:24:36,550 --> 01:24:39,635
She, um, gave me up.

986
01:24:39,761 --> 01:24:41,011
I was younger than you.

987
01:24:41,137 --> 01:24:45,140
They were vagrants
and, um, she was alone.

988
01:24:46,851 --> 01:24:48,895
And for a long time,
I thought she was stupid

989
01:24:49,020 --> 01:24:50,688
for getting on
the drug she was on,

990
01:24:50,814 --> 01:24:54,399
but now I see she was...
so alone.

991
01:24:54,525 --> 01:24:57,819
It's what she had.

992
01:24:57,945 --> 01:25:00,907
You know, she sold me
to a panhandle gang.

993
01:25:01,033 --> 01:25:04,618
I got away and I ran and l...
I ended on this train.

994
01:25:04,744 --> 01:25:07,913
I remember I was sitting there
in an empty car,

995
01:25:08,039 --> 01:25:10,625
and I saw myself,
over and over again,

996
01:25:10,751 --> 01:25:13,586
killing those men that bought me,

997
01:25:13,712 --> 01:25:15,630
that got my mom on
what she was on.

998
01:25:15,756 --> 01:25:18,006
Just finding them
and tearing them apart.

999
01:25:18,132 --> 01:25:19,550
Saving my mom.

1000
01:25:19,676 --> 01:25:21,092
- But you didn't.

1001
01:25:21,220 --> 01:25:25,055
- No, a man in the city
found me, put a gun in my hand,

1002
01:25:25,181 --> 01:25:27,099
gave me something that was mine.

1003
01:25:27,225 --> 01:25:30,101
That's just men trying to figure out

1004
01:25:30,229 --> 01:25:32,063
what they would do
to keep what's theirs,

1005
01:25:32,189 --> 01:25:34,439
what they got.

1006
01:25:34,565 --> 01:25:36,984
That's the only kind
of man there is.

1007
01:25:37,109 --> 01:25:40,947
- I'm not gonna let Sara get killed.

1008
01:25:51,332 --> 01:25:53,000
- I think we're clear.

1009
01:26:04,054 --> 01:26:05,846
- Sara!

1010
01:26:09,893 --> 01:26:11,435
- Here, baby.

1011
01:26:28,953 --> 01:26:32,206
All working girls, yeah?

1012
01:26:32,332 --> 01:26:34,000
- This whole block and a couple

1013
01:26:34,126 --> 01:26:36,877
of blocks over.

1014
01:26:37,003 --> 01:26:37,962
- Hello, Joe.

1015
01:26:38,087 --> 01:26:39,671
- lf you want to check those, too,

1016
01:26:39,797 --> 01:26:41,631
I can arrange.

1017
01:26:45,595 --> 01:26:47,470
I'm an arranger, stranger.

1018
01:26:47,597 --> 01:26:50,975
lf you don't see what you
want to see, no refunds.

1019
01:27:55,247 --> 01:27:56,957
- What?

1020
01:27:57,083 --> 01:27:59,835
What happened?

1021
01:28:47,009 --> 01:28:49,010
That is pretty good.

1022
01:28:51,721 --> 01:28:55,099
- ln the city, young guys
would hit on me

1023
01:28:55,225 --> 01:28:58,853
by floating fuckin' quarters.

1024
01:28:58,979 --> 01:29:01,271
And I wouldn't tell 'em I was TK,

1025
01:29:01,398 --> 01:29:05,109
but I would keep
their quarters down.

1026
01:29:05,234 --> 01:29:08,487
This one guy almost
busted a blood vessel

1027
01:29:08,613 --> 01:29:11,573
in his eye trying to get it up.

1028
01:29:24,003 --> 01:29:25,503
He's you.

1029
01:29:25,630 --> 01:29:28,466
Your loop.

1030
01:29:28,591 --> 01:29:30,341
You lied to me.

1031
01:29:30,469 --> 01:29:33,636
But I know you're not lying

1032
01:29:33,764 --> 01:29:36,015
when you say
you're gonna kill this guy,

1033
01:29:36,140 --> 01:29:38,975
your own self.

1034
01:29:39,101 --> 01:29:42,395
You protected Cid
from that gat man.

1035
01:29:42,521 --> 01:29:44,774
- Um, he...

1036
01:29:44,899 --> 01:29:46,274
Yeah.

1037
01:29:46,400 --> 01:29:49,862
- Ah, he saved your ass, didn't he? Yeah.
- He saved my ass.

1038
01:29:49,988 --> 01:29:51,988
He's a...

1039
01:29:53,992 --> 01:29:55,701
He's a good kid.

1040
01:29:55,827 --> 01:29:57,828
- Yeah, he is.

1041
01:30:00,457 --> 01:30:06,212
You know, when I came back,
after my sister died,

1042
01:30:06,337 --> 01:30:10,048
I remember seeing him

1043
01:30:10,175 --> 01:30:14,804
for the first time in two years
just sitting on the porch.

1044
01:30:14,930 --> 01:30:17,765
I drove up crying.

1045
01:30:17,890 --> 01:30:21,894
I'd been at this party
all night in the city

1046
01:30:22,020 --> 01:30:24,020
when I got the call.

1047
01:30:26,690 --> 01:30:30,694
So I was wearing
this ridiculous party dress.

1048
01:30:33,614 --> 01:30:35,615
All my ridiculous shit.

1049
01:30:38,244 --> 01:30:41,372
And I don't know if he...

1050
01:30:41,497 --> 01:30:45,292
if he even remembered me, but...

1051
01:30:45,417 --> 01:30:47,418
but he looked at me...

1052
01:30:54,426 --> 01:30:56,427
I abandoned him.

1053
01:31:00,141 --> 01:31:02,143
I abandoned my baby.

1054
01:31:05,729 --> 01:31:09,399
And I seen so many men

1055
01:31:09,525 --> 01:31:12,778
in the city who I look

1056
01:31:12,904 --> 01:31:15,905
in their eyes and they're just lost.

1057
01:31:17,908 --> 01:31:20,493
So whether
he loves me back or not,

1058
01:31:20,619 --> 01:31:26,750
as long as I'm there to raise him,

1059
01:31:26,877 --> 01:31:29,878
he's gonna be taken care of.

1060
01:31:30,005 --> 01:31:33,006
He's gonna be safe.

1061
01:31:35,635 --> 01:31:37,636
He's never gonna get lost.

1062
01:31:59,868 --> 01:32:01,868
- Hello, Joe.

1063
01:32:03,329 --> 01:32:04,579
- Jesse.

1064
01:32:06,166 --> 01:32:07,207
Put this down

1065
01:32:07,333 --> 01:32:09,918
and let her go.

1066
01:32:10,045 --> 01:32:12,128
Sara, Jesse here's the best shot

1067
01:32:12,255 --> 01:32:14,422
with a gat that I know.

1068
01:32:14,548 --> 01:32:17,009
So when he lets you go,
just sit down on the couch.

1069
01:32:17,135 --> 01:32:18,176
Don't do anything stupid.

1070
01:32:24,059 --> 01:32:25,684
He's coming here, Jess.

1071
01:32:25,810 --> 01:32:28,811
Μy loop is coming here.
- I got to take you in, man.

1072
01:32:28,939 --> 01:32:31,774
- I got 948 bars of pure silver.

1073
01:32:31,899 --> 01:32:33,943
I'm gonna close my loop,
I get right with Abe,

1074
01:32:34,069 --> 01:32:36,528
whatever he gives me back,
I'll split it with you.

1075
01:32:36,654 --> 01:32:38,279
- Was that your plan?

1076
01:32:38,405 --> 01:32:40,240
- Okay, take all of it.

1077
01:32:40,367 --> 01:32:41,574
- Are you delusional?

1078
01:32:41,743 --> 01:32:43,327
You ain't getting right
with anyone.

1079
01:32:43,453 --> 01:32:45,287
Long as Abe's got
one gat man standing,

1080
01:32:45,412 --> 01:32:47,538
he's gonna be hunting you
till his dying day.

1081
01:32:47,666 --> 01:32:49,416
We're gonna go now.

1082
01:32:49,542 --> 01:32:51,542
We're gonna get in my truck
and you're just gonna...

1083
01:33:07,226 --> 01:33:08,351
- I'm sorry.

1084
01:34:10,998 --> 01:34:12,750
The Rainmaker.

1085
01:34:36,440 --> 01:34:40,319
- Cid! Cid!

1086
01:34:40,444 --> 01:34:44,155
Oh, my God.

1087
01:34:44,282 --> 01:34:45,990
Cid. Cid!

1088
01:34:49,328 --> 01:34:50,996
Cid!

1089
01:34:51,122 --> 01:34:53,082
- It's him.

1090
01:34:53,207 --> 01:34:55,292
What is he, some TK freak?

1091
01:34:55,417 --> 01:34:57,043
You knew.

1092
01:34:59,756 --> 01:35:01,047
- What are you doing
with those guns?

1093
01:35:01,173 --> 01:35:03,384
- How'd your sister die?
- What are you doing with those guns?!

1094
01:35:03,510 --> 01:35:04,967
- How did your sister die?!

1095
01:35:05,095 --> 01:35:06,220
How'd she die?!
ls that what happened to her?!

1096
01:35:06,345 --> 01:35:07,845
- No, no.
- Did he kill her like that?!

1097
01:35:07,971 --> 01:35:09,890
- No, listen, he was climbing
a bookshelf, okay?

1098
01:35:10,015 --> 01:35:11,391
And it-it fell back on him.

1099
01:35:11,518 --> 01:35:13,351
And he-he gets scared,

1100
01:35:13,478 --> 01:35:14,853
it explodes!
- Jesus friggin'...

1101
01:35:14,979 --> 01:35:16,563
- But one day,
he'll learn to control it.

1102
01:35:16,689 --> 01:35:18,148
- I know he will!
lmagine what he's gonna do!

1103
01:35:18,274 --> 01:35:20,609
- lf he did good with it, though...

1104
01:35:20,734 --> 01:35:23,654
lf he grew up with me raising him...

1105
01:35:23,779 --> 01:35:25,863
lf-if he grew up good...

1106
01:35:25,989 --> 01:35:28,492
- He doesn't.

1107
01:35:28,618 --> 01:35:31,453
- You stay away from him, Joe.

1108
01:35:35,332 --> 01:35:37,626
Cid!

1109
01:35:37,752 --> 01:35:39,293
Cid, stay away from Joe, baby!

1110
01:35:39,421 --> 01:35:43,340
Talk to me, baby!

1111
01:36:42,358 --> 01:36:43,442
Come to me.

1112
01:36:43,568 --> 01:36:45,569
It's okay.

1113
01:36:48,030 --> 01:36:51,408
It's okay, baby.

1114
01:36:53,453 --> 01:36:56,162
- All right, now two things
have happened.

1115
01:36:56,288 --> 01:36:58,332
Μy loop knows Cid's the kid
he's looking for.

1116
01:36:58,457 --> 01:37:01,292
And my gang knows I'm here.
So that means in 1 5 minutes,

1117
01:37:01,418 --> 01:37:03,587
one or both of them's
coming down that highway.

1118
01:37:04,796 --> 01:37:06,256
Back up the gat man's truck.

1119
01:37:06,381 --> 01:37:09,301
Take everything you can fit and go.
Drive north away from the city.

1120
01:37:09,426 --> 01:37:12,429
- Thank you.

1121
01:37:24,484 --> 01:37:27,360
- Got everyone here, all our men.

1122
01:37:27,487 --> 01:37:29,195
Arm them up.
Let's go.

1123
01:37:37,204 --> 01:37:38,872
- I got him, Abe!

1124
01:37:38,997 --> 01:37:40,082
I got him!

1125
01:37:40,207 --> 01:37:43,835
- Well, shit.

1126
01:37:45,671 --> 01:37:47,338
- That's right, motherfuckers.

1127
01:37:47,465 --> 01:37:49,091
- Whoa.

1128
01:37:49,216 --> 01:37:50,676
- I got him.

1129
01:37:50,801 --> 01:37:52,761
Knew he was sweet on this
one particular whore,

1130
01:37:52,886 --> 01:37:54,637
so I checked her building.

1131
01:37:54,764 --> 01:37:57,306
- They found Joe, too, though,
in a farm on the east side.

1132
01:37:57,432 --> 01:37:59,225
That's why
all the gat men are here.

1133
01:37:59,351 --> 01:38:02,186
The whole crew's
arming up to make a sweep.

1134
01:38:02,313 --> 01:38:03,729
- Joe?

1135
01:38:03,855 --> 01:38:05,356
Fuck Joe.

1136
01:38:05,483 --> 01:38:06,858
Save your bullets!
I got the loop!

1137
01:38:06,984 --> 01:38:08,944
Not such a fuck-up now, huh?

1138
01:38:09,069 --> 01:38:10,654
I'm bringing him up to see Abe.

1139
01:38:14,908 --> 01:38:15,993
He got loose!

1140
01:38:18,037 --> 01:38:20,162
- Shit!

1141
01:38:20,289 --> 01:38:22,039
Come on!
Get this asshole!

1142
01:38:24,252 --> 01:38:25,335
- That hurt?!

1143
01:38:25,461 --> 01:38:26,920
You goddamn soulless motherfuckers!

1144
01:39:39,034 --> 01:39:40,911
Holy shit.

1145
01:39:47,710 --> 01:39:49,627
Joe!

1146
01:39:49,753 --> 01:39:53,715
Guess I put the gun
in that kid's hand, huh?

1147
01:39:56,761 --> 01:40:01,097
I guess
everything comes back around.

1148
01:40:01,224 --> 01:40:04,100
Like your goddamn ties.

1149
01:41:28,019 --> 01:41:29,685
- Take this truck.

1150
01:41:29,811 --> 01:41:31,896
And take your gold
and go live your life.

1151
01:41:32,023 --> 01:41:33,939
Nobody's coming after you.

1152
01:41:34,065 --> 01:41:35,775
I fixed it.

1153
01:41:35,902 --> 01:41:38,235
- You go kill the boy?
That how you fix it?

1154
01:41:38,362 --> 01:41:40,322
- You're goddamn right
I'm going to kill that boy!

1155
01:41:40,448 --> 01:41:42,198
You just got
your life back.

1156
01:41:42,324 --> 01:41:44,158
- Μy life?

1157
01:41:44,284 --> 01:41:45,868
Your life!

1158
01:41:45,994 --> 01:41:47,119
Becoming you.

1159
01:41:47,246 --> 01:41:48,662
- Goddamn it!

1160
01:41:48,789 --> 01:41:50,207
You have lost your fucking mind!

1161
01:41:50,332 --> 01:41:52,583
You let this boy live,
he's going to take

1162
01:41:52,710 --> 01:41:54,168
everything you've got.

1163
01:41:54,295 --> 01:41:56,253
And everything I got.

1164
01:41:56,380 --> 01:41:57,797
See what he becomes.

1165
01:41:57,923 --> 01:42:00,257
- I haven't seen that yet.

1166
01:42:00,384 --> 01:42:02,010
- Goddamn it!

1167
01:42:52,895 --> 01:42:54,729
- Shit.

1168
01:42:54,855 --> 01:42:57,189
- Okay, baby, we're going.

1169
01:42:58,359 --> 01:43:00,985
Put your seat belt on.

1170
01:43:27,262 --> 01:43:28,971
- Stop.
- Duck down, baby. It's okay.

1171
01:43:29,097 --> 01:43:30,556
- Stop, please.
He can shoot us.

1172
01:43:30,682 --> 01:43:31,765
- Duck down, baby.
- Stop!

1173
01:43:31,893 --> 01:43:34,560
lf we get too close,
he can shoot us!

1174
01:43:34,686 --> 01:43:37,479
Stop! Stop! Stop!
- Get down.

1175
01:43:56,375 --> 01:43:57,708
Cid.

1176
01:43:57,835 --> 01:43:58,960
- I'm sorry.

1177
01:43:59,086 --> 01:44:00,545
- It's okay.

1178
01:44:00,671 --> 01:44:03,006
It's okay.
I'm going to get you down.

1179
01:44:11,556 --> 01:44:13,682
Okay.
We're going into the cane.

1180
01:44:13,809 --> 01:44:15,644
Go. Go.

1181
01:44:21,524 --> 01:44:23,609
Keep going.

1182
01:44:41,045 --> 01:44:42,796
No!

1183
01:44:50,304 --> 01:44:52,180
No. Cid, no.

1184
01:45:41,021 --> 01:45:43,605
No!

1185
01:45:48,695 --> 01:45:51,823
It's okay, baby.

1186
01:45:51,948 --> 01:45:54,617
You're okay.

1187
01:45:54,743 --> 01:45:57,119
It's okay, baby.

1188
01:46:00,791 --> 01:46:02,917
It's okay.

1189
01:46:03,043 --> 01:46:04,252
I love you.

1190
01:46:04,377 --> 01:46:06,587
Calm down.

1191
01:46:06,713 --> 01:46:09,298
Good boy.

1192
01:46:10,634 --> 01:46:17,890
Μommy loves you.

1193
01:46:19,435 --> 01:46:21,478
It's okay.

1194
01:46:23,229 --> 01:46:24,814
- Μom.

1195
01:46:35,242 --> 01:46:36,868
- Shit.

1196
01:46:39,662 --> 01:46:41,456
- Oh, you did good.

1197
01:46:41,582 --> 01:46:42,707
You did so good.

1198
01:46:42,832 --> 01:46:44,083
Good boy.

1199
01:46:46,921 --> 01:46:48,171
Okay, listen to me.

1200
01:46:48,296 --> 01:46:50,006
I need you to run
into the fields now.

1201
01:46:50,131 --> 01:46:52,257
- No, Μom, no.
I don't want to leave you.

1202
01:46:52,384 --> 01:46:55,095
I don't want to leave you, Μom. No.
- It's okay. You need to go. Go.

1203
01:46:55,220 --> 01:46:56,261
Μove!

1204
01:46:56,387 --> 01:46:57,680
Μove, goddamn it!

1205
01:47:14,489 --> 01:47:16,533
Μove.

1206
01:47:21,329 --> 01:47:22,956
Then I saw it.

1207
01:47:27,127 --> 01:47:30,712
I saw a mom who would die
for her son.

1208
01:47:32,632 --> 01:47:35,135
A man who would kill
for his wife.

1209
01:47:37,262 --> 01:47:40,347
A boy, angry and alone.

1210
01:47:40,474 --> 01:47:44,435
Laid out in front of him,
the bad path... I saw it.

1211
01:47:46,354 --> 01:47:48,398
And the path was a circle.

1212
01:47:51,777 --> 01:47:54,028
Round and round.

1213
01:48:04,622 --> 01:48:06,457
So I changed it.

1214
01:48:21,849 --> 01:48:24,057
- Cid!

1215
01:48:46,873 --> 01:48:48,917
- Where's Joe?

1216
01:48:50,043 --> 01:48:52,587
- He had to go away, baby.

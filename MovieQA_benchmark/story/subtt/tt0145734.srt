1
00:02:24,841 --> 00:02:27,636
I'm alone, and I want
to keep it that way.

2
00:02:27,707 --> 00:02:30,298
I lost my wife and son.

3
00:02:30,373 --> 00:02:34,135
- Well, ask the bartender.
He can find anything.
- No.

4
00:02:34,207 --> 00:02:36,002
They're dead.

5
00:02:38,841 --> 00:02:41,398
Do you wanna talk about it?

6
00:03:10,673 --> 00:03:12,798
Any guys here
taking this Viagra? Let's see.

7
00:03:12,873 --> 00:03:14,930
Not one honest guy.

8
00:03:15,005 --> 00:03:17,733
Have you--
Okay?

9
00:03:17,806 --> 00:03:21,568
You know, you have to be--
A friend of mine dropped one of
these Viagra pills on the floor...

10
00:03:21,639 --> 00:03:24,366
and his dog swallowed it.

11
00:03:24,439 --> 00:03:26,962
Now he has a pointer. Anyway--

12
00:03:29,406 --> 00:03:32,998
- We have to talk about this.
- I know. You're right.

13
00:03:35,773 --> 00:03:38,001
But do you really think
we can save this marriage...

14
00:03:38,073 --> 00:03:41,061
now that I've decided I like Leno
better than Letterman?

15
00:03:41,139 --> 00:03:44,469
Don't. I'm sorry.

16
00:03:44,539 --> 00:03:47,471
I remember when my jokes
used to make you laugh.

17
00:03:47,539 --> 00:03:49,471
They do. I just--

18
00:03:54,639 --> 00:03:58,628
- We have to talk about this.
- There's nothing to talk about.

19
00:03:58,705 --> 00:04:01,763
Oh, of course there is.

20
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,771
But I don't want to.

21
00:04:07,306 --> 00:04:09,238
Okay.

22
00:04:12,206 --> 00:04:14,138
What about the party?

23
00:04:14,206 --> 00:04:16,798
Well, nothing's changed.
I have a brain tumor...

24
00:04:16,872 --> 00:04:19,599
but I'm going to that party,
with or without you.

25
00:04:19,673 --> 00:04:22,195
We've put a deposit down.

26
00:04:24,005 --> 00:04:25,937
Mission accomplished.

27
00:04:29,472 --> 00:04:30,530
I am in love.

28
00:04:31,272 --> 00:04:32,760
In love?

29
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:34,771
Yes, in love.

30
00:04:34,839 --> 00:04:38,271
But before we go further,
let me say this.

31
00:04:38,339 --> 00:04:42,031
Before we go...
further--

32
00:04:42,105 --> 00:04:46,469
I can't go any further.

33
00:04:46,538 --> 00:04:50,300
It's almost 1:00, Meredith. 1:00.

34
00:04:50,371 --> 00:04:54,304
- And I got a day job, remember?
- Yeah. Phil needs his sleep.
He's a postal worker.

35
00:04:54,371 --> 00:04:56,564
All right, slackers.
Trot off home.

36
00:04:57,638 --> 00:04:59,933
Good night.

37
00:05:00,005 --> 00:05:02,868
- Settle a bet I have with Phillip?
- Yeah.

38
00:05:02,939 --> 00:05:06,132
He claims you have
no personal life whatsoever.

39
00:05:06,205 --> 00:05:08,331
I say that's impossible.

40
00:05:08,405 --> 00:05:10,997
I hope it wasn't a large bet.

41
00:05:11,071 --> 00:05:13,969
On equity waiver salary
you can't afford to lose much.

42
00:05:14,038 --> 00:05:15,971
No Mr. Right?

43
00:05:17,105 --> 00:05:19,535
Ms. Right?

44
00:05:19,605 --> 00:05:23,196
No inclination for either at the moment.
Thank you very much.

45
00:05:23,271 --> 00:05:26,964
But if you're fishing,
"mister" is my gender of choice.

46
00:05:27,038 --> 00:05:30,436
You're a wonderful person.
You should have someone in your life.

47
00:05:30,505 --> 00:05:32,436
That's all I'm saying.

48
00:05:32,505 --> 00:05:37,164
I can still be a wonderful person
and not have anybody in my life.

49
00:05:37,238 --> 00:05:40,227
Look, I'm just not interested
in a relationship right now.

50
00:05:40,305 --> 00:05:42,237
You are such a liar.

51
00:05:43,704 --> 00:05:46,499
I am such a liar.

52
00:05:55,472 --> 00:05:58,063
Front desk.

53
00:05:58,138 --> 00:06:00,070
Hold that, please!

54
00:06:04,504 --> 00:06:08,903
Did she not say,
"Hold that, please"?
Or isn't English your first language?

55
00:06:22,337 --> 00:06:24,270
Any trouble getting away?

56
00:06:24,337 --> 00:06:26,565
He has his acting class tonight.

57
00:06:26,638 --> 00:06:30,296
- You want me to get champagne?
- I don't think I have time for that.

58
00:06:32,171 --> 00:06:35,227
In case you're planning on
being gentle tonight...

59
00:06:36,238 --> 00:06:38,067
don't be.

60
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:25,503
Mom?

61
00:07:27,736 --> 00:07:30,258
Welcome to Chicago.

62
00:07:32,004 --> 00:07:35,231
You look awful.

63
00:07:35,304 --> 00:07:39,100
- You should get some sleep.
- I'll sleep when you sleep.

64
00:07:47,303 --> 00:07:49,463
It happened three days ago.

65
00:07:49,537 --> 00:07:53,764
The last time I talked with her--
my wife Leann--

66
00:07:54,937 --> 00:07:57,062
It was about 3:00.

67
00:07:57,137 --> 00:08:01,126
She was taking our son Jamey
to, uh, soccer practice.

68
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:07,835
Uh, I had a meeting at a bar.

69
00:08:07,903 --> 00:08:12,232
I'd had a few drinks. No more
than usual-- standard four-drink buzz.

70
00:08:12,303 --> 00:08:14,235
Maybe five.

71
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:20,800
After, I was gonna meet Leann and Jamey
at the Pizza Hut.

72
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:25,127
Every Tuesday night
Jamey wants Pizza Hut.

73
00:08:26,869 --> 00:08:29,267
So I was late.

74
00:08:29,336 --> 00:08:31,734
I was driving fast.

75
00:08:31,803 --> 00:08:35,428
Not too fast, I think.

76
00:08:36,970 --> 00:08:39,902
The light, it just turned.

77
00:08:41,869 --> 00:08:43,802
It was red for only a second.

78
00:08:43,869 --> 00:08:45,892
Less than.
I swear.

79
00:08:48,503 --> 00:08:50,435
I ran the light.

80
00:08:53,369 --> 00:08:55,494
I saw the car.

81
00:08:55,569 --> 00:08:58,195
I hit my wife's car.

82
00:08:58,269 --> 00:09:00,201
Oh, my God.

83
00:09:00,269 --> 00:09:04,201
I saw her face through the windshield
just as I hit them.

84
00:09:06,702 --> 00:09:09,691
She saw me.

85
00:09:09,769 --> 00:09:12,429
She knew it was me.

86
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:15,567
Oh.

87
00:09:16,903 --> 00:09:18,925
You shouldn't be alone.

88
00:09:20,303 --> 00:09:22,326
Yes, I should.

89
00:09:22,403 --> 00:09:24,891
I should be alone in hell.

90
00:09:24,969 --> 00:09:26,902
That's where I am.

91
00:09:59,669 --> 00:10:04,125
Twenty minutes at 350 degrees
is absolutely essential.

92
00:10:04,202 --> 00:10:06,225
No more, no less.

93
00:10:06,302 --> 00:10:09,928
And the delicacy of this fish
is best appreciated by its taste...

94
00:10:10,001 --> 00:10:13,229
not necessarily by its appearance.

95
00:10:13,302 --> 00:10:15,325
Once you remove the fish
from the oven...

96
00:10:17,335 --> 00:10:20,596
transfer it directly
onto a heated plate.

97
00:10:27,502 --> 00:10:31,831
There's one thing that's
paramount for every cook to keep
in the back of their mind.

98
00:10:38,368 --> 00:10:40,596
Only you know
what goes on in the kitchen.

99
00:10:40,669 --> 00:10:44,101
Hannah's Country Kitchen Cooking.

100
00:10:46,302 --> 00:10:48,234
And we're clear.

101
00:10:48,302 --> 00:10:52,791
Hannah, that was incredible!
I smell a fourth Emmy.

102
00:10:56,601 --> 00:10:58,965
I don't wanna see any more
of these. Hmm?

103
00:10:59,035 --> 00:11:01,296
Tough. Oh, l--

104
00:11:01,367 --> 00:11:04,766
Mmm. It's delicious.
What?

105
00:11:04,835 --> 00:11:07,232
Nothing.

106
00:11:12,402 --> 00:11:14,890
You can never stop, can you?

107
00:11:14,968 --> 00:11:18,627
- Stop what?
- Organizing things.

108
00:11:18,701 --> 00:11:22,155
- Oh, I'll stop if it bothers you.
- No.

109
00:11:22,235 --> 00:11:25,224
It doesn't bother me.
It takes me back.

110
00:11:28,401 --> 00:11:30,663
Sit next to me.

111
00:11:42,001 --> 00:11:44,432
It's a hell of a way
for you to find out, huh?

112
00:11:44,501 --> 00:11:47,592
- Find out what?
- Well, that I'm gay, for one.

113
00:11:49,468 --> 00:11:51,957
Come on.
You never suspected?

114
00:11:52,034 --> 00:11:55,932
- You were always so good at sports.
- Mom!

115
00:11:56,001 --> 00:12:00,456
I'm really glad you're here.

116
00:12:01,967 --> 00:12:05,263
- And what's the second thing?
- What second thing?

117
00:12:05,334 --> 00:12:09,595
You said it was a hell of a way
for me to find out that you
were gay for "one" thing.

118
00:12:09,667 --> 00:12:12,099
- So what's the second thing?
- That I'm dying.

119
00:12:12,167 --> 00:12:15,964
- Don't say that!
- Oh, stop! I can't go back into
our classic mother-son pattern.

120
00:12:16,034 --> 00:12:21,126
Okay? I can't play the Iverson family
game of denying reality...

121
00:12:21,201 --> 00:12:23,792
- where reality is over there,
somewhere...
- Oh, honey, don't.

122
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:27,163
and we hide from it over here
and pretend it doesn't exist.

123
00:12:27,234 --> 00:12:31,064
Okay? It takes too much energy.
Energy that I don't have.

124
00:12:31,134 --> 00:12:33,326
All right. Maybe I don't either...
have the energy.

125
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,389
God, that would be good.

126
00:12:35,467 --> 00:12:37,933
All right, we'll start fresh.

127
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,932
Pattern-free.

128
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,160
Within these four walls,
reality will prevail.

129
00:12:44,233 --> 00:12:47,529
And if I slip up,
you-- you let me know.

130
00:12:47,601 --> 00:12:49,498
You'll--
You'll be the first.

131
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,896
They say first steps
are the hardest.

132
00:13:02,933 --> 00:13:05,991
The doctor said
you haven't had any visitors.

133
00:13:06,067 --> 00:13:10,862
You know me, Mom. I've never been
one to have a lot of friends.

134
00:13:10,934 --> 00:13:14,923
Besides, I seem to be
the last of my small crowd.

135
00:13:14,999 --> 00:13:17,056
What about your roommate Jack?

136
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:23,594
He wasn't my roommate, Mother,
and he died a year ago.

137
00:13:28,467 --> 00:13:30,433
Hey, how's the commercial going?

138
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,432
It's on hold for a week.

139
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:37,057
The geniuses at Pacific Motors
have now decided to spotlight the car...

140
00:13:37,133 --> 00:13:39,065
and dumb down the concept.

141
00:13:39,133 --> 00:13:43,792
- No Fellini?
- Who? Most definitely no Fellini.

142
00:13:43,867 --> 00:13:46,526
But my play's not falling apart.

143
00:13:46,599 --> 00:13:48,623
- I'm happy for you.
- Thank you.

144
00:13:48,699 --> 00:13:50,790
Bosco, where do you keep
Theater Week?

145
00:13:50,866 --> 00:13:54,889
Top shelf. Between Psychology Today
and Martha Stewart Living.

146
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,531
Uh-oh!
Whoa!

147
00:13:59,599 --> 00:14:02,691
Jesus! Meredith?

148
00:14:02,766 --> 00:14:05,755
Jimmy, grab that side! Grab that side.
Okay. Everyone. All right, fellas.

149
00:14:05,833 --> 00:14:09,425
On three. One--
Oh. Okay. All right.

150
00:14:09,499 --> 00:14:12,159
- Can we say "lawsuit"?
- Uh, are you okay?

151
00:14:12,233 --> 00:14:15,256
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Fine.
I landed on a stack of George.

152
00:14:15,332 --> 00:14:18,424
- Plenty of padding.
- Meet the architect.

153
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:22,626
- Are you sure you're okay?
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. Thank you.

154
00:14:22,699 --> 00:14:26,187
- If I can just find one,
Theater Week is on me.
- And dinner is on me.

155
00:14:26,265 --> 00:14:30,221
- No, no. Not necessary. Truly.
- Please. I insist.
It's the least I can do. I mean--

156
00:14:30,299 --> 00:14:33,663
- Look, I'm not gonna sue you, okay?
- I didn't think you were gonna sue me.

157
00:14:36,132 --> 00:14:38,894
Not that I couldn't, mind you.
But something tells me...

158
00:14:38,966 --> 00:14:42,228
that you'd be able to convince
the jury that this was my fault.

159
00:14:42,299 --> 00:14:47,096
You know I'm not just asking you
to dinner as a preemptive strike
against litigation.

160
00:14:47,166 --> 00:14:49,654
- I'm asking because--
- I'll have dinner with you.

161
00:14:51,333 --> 00:14:54,560
- What changed your mind?
- Anybody who can say
"preemptive strike...

162
00:14:54,632 --> 00:14:57,723
against litigation" with a straight face
deserves a dinner companion.

163
00:14:57,799 --> 00:15:00,629
Thank you.

164
00:15:01,833 --> 00:15:03,321
This is last week's.

165
00:15:03,466 --> 00:15:07,160
I'm thinking of putting
the show on hiatus.

166
00:15:07,232 --> 00:15:09,824
And I'm thinking
you'll do no such thing.

167
00:15:09,898 --> 00:15:15,229
- But, Paul--
- No. I don't want anything
to be any different.

168
00:15:15,299 --> 00:15:19,026
- Things are different.
- I don't want to have a fight with you.

169
00:15:19,098 --> 00:15:22,292
I don't want a fight. I just--
I just want to talk and make--

170
00:15:22,365 --> 00:15:26,695
Look. What about what I want?
You've always controlled everything:

171
00:15:26,766 --> 00:15:28,755
your shows, the kids.

172
00:15:28,833 --> 00:15:31,559
Stop trying to control me.

173
00:15:31,631 --> 00:15:33,620
I'm not trying
to control anybody.

174
00:15:33,698 --> 00:15:36,494
- I just think maybe--
- Don't think.

175
00:15:36,565 --> 00:15:40,361
Let us just proceed as if
nothing has changed. All right?

176
00:15:44,566 --> 00:15:48,622
- I don't know if I can do that.
- You have no choice.

177
00:15:50,532 --> 00:15:53,794
I may have just enough time left
to become an alcoholic.

178
00:16:27,598 --> 00:16:31,190
I don't care who had her first. I poke
around her stool looking for worms.

179
00:16:31,265 --> 00:16:33,322
I feed the fucking thing.
I take her to the vet.

180
00:16:33,398 --> 00:16:35,523
All you do is pet her twice a day.

181
00:16:35,598 --> 00:16:38,496
Which is a hell of a lot more
than you've been doing to me lately.

182
00:16:38,565 --> 00:16:40,723
Okay, let's discuss this calmly.

183
00:16:40,798 --> 00:16:44,560
We're adults.
We've been together a long time.

184
00:16:44,631 --> 00:16:46,994
Well, not a long time,
but an adequate four months.

185
00:16:47,065 --> 00:16:50,929
Adequate until you fuckin' cheated on me
with that skag from Bloomingdale's!

186
00:16:50,997 --> 00:16:52,930
You fu--
Harry?

187
00:16:52,998 --> 00:16:56,657
Don't you dare hang up.
Harry! Harry?

188
00:16:57,932 --> 00:17:00,420
Shit! Shit.

189
00:17:07,764 --> 00:17:10,356
Hi. You got a quarter?

190
00:17:14,965 --> 00:17:16,896
Thank you.

191
00:17:22,363 --> 00:17:24,296
The fucking cat is mine.

192
00:17:25,465 --> 00:17:28,260
No, no.
On this I'm not negotiable, Harry.

193
00:17:28,331 --> 00:17:31,263
Harry. Hey! Hey!
Don't be a fuckin' infant, okay?

194
00:17:31,331 --> 00:17:35,285
You can take anything that came
from IKEA. I want the cat,
and I want Pottery Barn.

195
00:17:35,364 --> 00:17:37,795
It--
One more time.

196
00:17:37,864 --> 00:17:40,763
You hang up one more time and l--

197
00:17:40,831 --> 00:17:42,763
Damn it.

198
00:17:46,363 --> 00:17:48,988
- It's my last one.
- Negotiations are almost over.

199
00:17:51,031 --> 00:17:52,963
Thank you.

200
00:17:57,197 --> 00:18:00,527
All right. Okay, scumbag.
You're robbing me blind...

201
00:18:00,597 --> 00:18:04,393
but I will give up Pottery Barn
if I can just have the cat.

202
00:18:05,897 --> 00:18:09,260
No! No. Pottery Barn does not
include Williams Sonoma.

203
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:12,524
They're two separate
establishments, Harry.

204
00:18:12,597 --> 00:18:15,029
Oh, Christ on crutches!
Okay, you know what, Harry?

205
00:18:15,096 --> 00:18:19,052
I want to get rid of you as much as l
want to get rid of that junk from IKEA.

206
00:18:19,131 --> 00:18:21,562
So here's the thing.

207
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:25,619
You can walk away with Pottery Barn,
Williams Sonoma, IKEA.

208
00:18:25,697 --> 00:18:30,561
And just to show you that I'm
a grown-up, I will throw in all
the crap from Hold Everything!

209
00:18:30,629 --> 00:18:33,425
Yeah! Yeah, that includes
the hanging shoe sorter.

210
00:18:33,497 --> 00:18:37,361
That's right.
Do we have a deal? Great.

211
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:40,521
So here's the thing.
I will be home in two hours.

212
00:18:40,596 --> 00:18:43,926
You and all your junk
from the catalogs will be gone...

213
00:18:43,996 --> 00:18:46,622
and the cat will be there waiting
for me, purring contentedly.

214
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:54,755
Well, the least I can do
after taking your last quarter
is let you buy me a drink.

215
00:19:07,596 --> 00:19:10,619
I work in the Twin Towers.
Entertainment law.

216
00:19:12,729 --> 00:19:15,127
- And you?
- Me?

217
00:19:15,196 --> 00:19:17,321
I'm not very good company.
I'm-- I'm sorry.

218
00:19:19,696 --> 00:19:21,628
No problem.

219
00:19:25,162 --> 00:19:28,288
- I'm not gonna bother you.
- Uh, don't go. l-l-I'm sorry.

220
00:19:28,362 --> 00:19:31,294
- No, I'm sorry. Really.
- Again, I'm sorry.

221
00:19:33,563 --> 00:19:36,858
- You've had a bad day.
- A killer.

222
00:19:36,930 --> 00:19:41,192
You know, yesterday I would have
said that things couldn't
possibly get any worse.

223
00:19:41,262 --> 00:19:43,694
They sure as hell
got worse today.

224
00:19:45,263 --> 00:19:49,093
I'm, uh--
I work in the, uh, Twin Towers too.

225
00:19:49,162 --> 00:19:52,651
I'm a development executive
over at ABC.

226
00:19:52,729 --> 00:19:56,491
I'm responsible for all those shit shows
that you don't watch on Thursday night.

227
00:19:56,563 --> 00:19:58,926
You're to blame for those?

228
00:19:58,996 --> 00:20:01,359
Afraid so.

229
00:20:01,429 --> 00:20:03,361
Everybody blames me.

230
00:20:03,429 --> 00:20:07,384
My boss, my wife, my secretary.

231
00:20:07,463 --> 00:20:09,395
Hell, even my kids.
They watch NBC.

232
00:20:09,463 --> 00:20:13,191
And I work like a dog...

233
00:20:13,262 --> 00:20:16,956
trying to find some way to fix
the Thursday night schedule.

234
00:20:20,862 --> 00:20:23,590
Well, I don't find a way to fix
the Thursday night schedule...

235
00:20:23,663 --> 00:20:25,788
and my boss,
today he tells me...

236
00:20:25,862 --> 00:20:29,760
that coming into the office
tomorrow isn't necessary.

237
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:34,558
Or coming in ever again,
for that matter.

238
00:20:36,395 --> 00:20:39,884
I wish you could
spend the night.

239
00:20:39,962 --> 00:20:41,895
You know I can't.

240
00:20:43,329 --> 00:20:45,453
- Is this all you want from us?
- Roger...

241
00:20:45,528 --> 00:20:49,052
and I mean this really sweetly,
there isn't any us.

242
00:20:49,129 --> 00:20:52,925
- Mmm. There's only this.
- Well, this could be different.

243
00:20:52,995 --> 00:20:55,119
Well, anything
can be different.

244
00:20:55,196 --> 00:20:57,355
But I don't want this to be.

245
00:20:57,429 --> 00:21:02,293
two very sexually compatible
people enjoying each other...

246
00:21:02,362 --> 00:21:05,759
with no obligations,
no complications...

247
00:21:05,829 --> 00:21:08,125
no individual history,
no mutual history...

248
00:21:08,196 --> 00:21:10,628
and no guilt.

249
00:21:10,695 --> 00:21:13,184
- That's awfully cold.
- It's awfully realistic.

250
00:21:13,262 --> 00:21:16,284
- I know you don't love your husband.
- Oh, but I know...

251
00:21:16,361 --> 00:21:18,987
that you do love your wife.

252
00:21:23,894 --> 00:21:26,326
I'll have a vodka martini,
very dry and straight up...

253
00:21:26,395 --> 00:21:31,419
- with three olives,
and my sullen friend here will have--
- A Coke.

254
00:21:31,495 --> 00:21:35,120
The poster boy for designated drivers
will have a Coke.

255
00:21:37,395 --> 00:21:40,054
- The guy on the phone?
- Harry.

256
00:21:40,128 --> 00:21:42,616
Harry, right.
We were together for five months.

257
00:21:42,695 --> 00:21:45,252
- I thought it was four.
- You were paying attention.

258
00:21:45,328 --> 00:21:47,589
Everyone in this club
was paying attention.

259
00:21:47,662 --> 00:21:50,093
We were together for five months.
But I knew it wasn't gonna work out...

260
00:21:50,162 --> 00:21:53,719
'cause the first time he comes over
I find out that he sits down to pee.

261
00:21:53,794 --> 00:21:57,249
- You don't do that, do you?
- No.

262
00:21:57,328 --> 00:21:59,294
So fuckin' lazy.
And in my experience...

263
00:21:59,361 --> 00:22:02,986
it extends to other aspects
of an individual's personality.

264
00:22:03,062 --> 00:22:07,891
Last time I saw him, Harry was wearing a
blue sweater and an idiotic expression.

265
00:22:07,961 --> 00:22:10,359
The sweater was new.

266
00:22:10,428 --> 00:22:12,586
Here's to good riddance Harry.

267
00:22:13,661 --> 00:22:15,594
Good riddance Harry.

268
00:22:24,894 --> 00:22:27,758
Hey, again please.

269
00:22:27,828 --> 00:22:30,988
And drier this time,
and three olives, not two.

270
00:22:31,061 --> 00:22:33,493
Three.
Nutritional value.

271
00:22:33,562 --> 00:22:35,551
Now, where were we?
Oh, so Harry.

272
00:22:35,628 --> 00:22:37,957
Right.

273
00:22:38,028 --> 00:22:40,084
The sex part wasn't bad.

274
00:22:40,161 --> 00:22:42,092
You know, for a while.

275
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:47,253
And then his consummate laziness
and lack of imagination
became tediously self-evident.

276
00:22:47,328 --> 00:22:52,317
Every time, everything was
exactly the same as the time previous.

277
00:22:52,394 --> 00:22:56,690
It was as if he had followed
some step-by-step instructional video.

278
00:22:56,760 --> 00:23:00,250
And about two weeks ago,
guess what I found in the apartment.

279
00:23:00,327 --> 00:23:05,316
- A step-by-step instructional video.
- Right! Here's the topper.

280
00:23:05,394 --> 00:23:08,452
I timed his performance
one night. Right?

281
00:23:08,527 --> 00:23:11,891
And then I checked the running time
on the video. And guess what.

282
00:23:11,961 --> 00:23:14,552
- To the minute.
- Right down to it.

283
00:23:14,626 --> 00:23:16,559
Twenty-three minutes, to be exact.

284
00:23:16,627 --> 00:23:18,559
Including credits.

285
00:23:19,626 --> 00:23:23,184
Anyway, he's history.

286
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:26,351
- But I still have Blanche.
- Who would be the cat.

287
00:23:26,427 --> 00:23:28,916
Oh, a great cat.
Very feline.

288
00:23:28,993 --> 00:23:31,084
The best cats are.

289
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:34,718
Blanche can look at you with a gaze
of unflappable superiority...

290
00:23:34,794 --> 00:23:39,192
that seems to spring from near total
detachment and disinterest.

291
00:23:40,627 --> 00:23:43,387
Not unlike
how you're looking at me now.

292
00:23:47,594 --> 00:23:49,525
Thank you.

293
00:23:51,461 --> 00:23:54,188
You don't say very much, do you?

294
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:58,192
- Does anyone, when they're with you?
- Don't get mean.

295
00:24:00,227 --> 00:24:04,284
We don't know each other well enough
yet. When we do, then you can get mean.

296
00:24:07,194 --> 00:24:09,455
So we should do this again sometime.

297
00:24:09,526 --> 00:24:12,981
- We're not doing anything.
- Okay. Then let's not do this.

298
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:15,685
Let's do something else.

299
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:18,056
I'll even let you be the man.
You can decide where we go on our date.

300
00:24:20,293 --> 00:24:23,124
I don't date.

301
00:24:23,194 --> 00:24:26,956
Well. Gee, I don't have
a witty comeback for that one.

302
00:24:27,026 --> 00:24:29,289
I mean, I'm used to
any number of brush-offs...

303
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:31,825
but that's, uh, that's a new one.

304
00:24:31,893 --> 00:24:34,859
Doesn't date.

305
00:24:34,927 --> 00:24:38,382
I'll admit I've seen you around. You're
always-- You're always dancing alone.

306
00:24:40,226 --> 00:24:43,057
- That's the way I like it.
- Why is that?

307
00:24:45,426 --> 00:24:47,654
I don't want to be
rude or unkind...

308
00:24:47,726 --> 00:24:50,158
or... mean.

309
00:24:52,426 --> 00:24:55,722
But I just don't come out with my entire
life story over martinis and a Coke.

310
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:01,858
I'm sorry, really.

311
00:25:01,926 --> 00:25:04,449
Your cat's lucky to have you.

312
00:25:12,526 --> 00:25:15,959
My wife had moved them out.

313
00:25:16,026 --> 00:25:18,822
Moved everything out.
Left a note.

314
00:25:18,893 --> 00:25:21,222
Very thoughtful.
Didn't realize she felt that way.

315
00:25:21,293 --> 00:25:23,122
What way?

316
00:25:26,926 --> 00:25:29,392
That I was a failure.

317
00:25:29,459 --> 00:25:33,256
Not only professionally,
but personally as well.

318
00:25:33,326 --> 00:25:37,156
Just like ABC no longer required
my services. She let me know...

319
00:25:37,226 --> 00:25:42,658
that she and the kids no longer
required my services or my presence.

320
00:25:42,725 --> 00:25:46,817
It turns out she's been
seeing some guy for a year...

321
00:25:46,892 --> 00:25:50,017
for a fucking year,
and I never suspected a thing.

322
00:25:50,092 --> 00:25:52,387
- And you know what the worst of it is?
- What?

323
00:25:52,459 --> 00:25:55,254
The guy that she left me for?
The fucker works for NBC!

324
00:25:55,325 --> 00:25:58,758
He's got my wife and my kids,
my cat and my dog...

325
00:25:58,826 --> 00:26:02,588
and he doesn't have to lose
any sleep over the Thursday
night fucking schedule!

326
00:26:10,959 --> 00:26:13,186
Honey?

327
00:26:13,258 --> 00:26:17,123
You should come to bed.
What are you working on so late?

328
00:26:17,193 --> 00:26:19,522
I was just checking on
your TV residuals.

329
00:26:19,592 --> 00:26:21,989
They're still robbing us blind.

330
00:26:22,059 --> 00:26:25,149
I happen to know you're
a tremendous hit on WWFU.

331
00:26:25,225 --> 00:26:26,918
Which is where?

332
00:26:26,991 --> 00:26:29,151
Intercourse, Pennsylvania.

333
00:26:29,226 --> 00:26:31,748
Oh, Intercourse.

334
00:26:31,826 --> 00:26:34,291
And they can't get enough
of you in Intercourse.

335
00:26:34,358 --> 00:26:36,290
And I know exactly
how they feel.

336
00:26:38,225 --> 00:26:40,953
Bed.

337
00:26:42,392 --> 00:26:45,119
Come on, Molly. Come on, Crackers.

338
00:26:53,658 --> 00:26:56,682
There you are, sir. Okay?

339
00:26:56,759 --> 00:27:00,986
- Cheers.
- I've been meaning to ask you
about your wedding ring.

340
00:27:03,558 --> 00:27:07,457
It's really just force
of habit. l, uh...

341
00:27:07,525 --> 00:27:11,752
divorced...
four chilling years ago.

342
00:27:12,825 --> 00:27:15,552
- Acrimonious?
- No.

343
00:27:15,624 --> 00:27:18,818
Oh, wait, that means
hostile and bitter. Yes.

344
00:27:18,891 --> 00:27:22,755
In the divorce papers she referred to me
as the "architect of her misfortune."

345
00:27:23,858 --> 00:27:27,484
- Ouch.
- Yeah. No kids, luckily.

346
00:27:27,559 --> 00:27:32,150
I wanted them,
but she didn't.

347
00:27:32,225 --> 00:27:34,157
- You know, if this makes you
uncomfortable--
- No.

348
00:27:34,225 --> 00:27:36,554
- I can take it off, the ring.
It's not a problem.
- No, no. Stop.

349
00:27:36,625 --> 00:27:41,079
Don't be silly.
That would be two of us being silly.

350
00:27:41,158 --> 00:27:45,180
I really only wear it to keep
the construction guys from harassing me.

351
00:27:46,458 --> 00:27:49,152
Does it work?

352
00:27:49,225 --> 00:27:52,281
Depends on what I'm wearing.

353
00:27:54,825 --> 00:27:58,882
I think you can tell
that I'm not very good at this.

354
00:28:01,559 --> 00:28:04,786
You're charming.

355
00:28:06,024 --> 00:28:09,752
And real.

356
00:28:09,824 --> 00:28:12,290
Lovely.

357
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:14,653
What did I say?

358
00:28:14,724 --> 00:28:16,781
Nothing.

359
00:28:16,857 --> 00:28:18,847
No, no. Nothing.

360
00:28:18,924 --> 00:28:22,016
I just, um--

361
00:28:22,090 --> 00:28:27,216
Before I came here tonight,
I was discussing you with my sister.

362
00:28:27,291 --> 00:28:30,780
We were coming up with
a psychological profile.

363
00:28:30,858 --> 00:28:32,790
Several, actually.

364
00:28:32,858 --> 00:28:36,722
- And which did I fit into?
- Oh, none.

365
00:28:36,790 --> 00:28:39,984
I think I'm gonna have to
revise the filing system.

366
00:28:40,057 --> 00:28:44,012
Put you in
the "too good to be true" category.

367
00:28:44,090 --> 00:28:48,022
Mmm.
But not to worry.

368
00:28:48,090 --> 00:28:50,920
I just know you'll turn out
to be involved with somebody else...

369
00:28:50,990 --> 00:28:54,514
or... gay or crazy.

370
00:28:58,790 --> 00:29:01,756
Well, it's a definite possibility.

371
00:29:04,524 --> 00:29:06,455
Crazy, huh?

372
00:29:07,623 --> 00:29:09,556
Certifiable.

373
00:29:13,423 --> 00:29:15,356
Mom.

374
00:29:16,790 --> 00:29:19,347
I know you've spoken to my doctor.

375
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:22,548
I know. I know he told you
I don't have long...

376
00:29:22,623 --> 00:29:25,089
so let's not pretend
that I do, okay?

377
00:29:27,223 --> 00:29:29,156
Want to watch another movie?

378
00:29:29,223 --> 00:29:31,781
No. God, no.

379
00:29:33,757 --> 00:29:37,211
I tell you what I would like,
is I'd like to play a game.

380
00:29:37,290 --> 00:29:42,416
- Should I get a deck of cards?
- No. Not that kind of game.

381
00:29:42,490 --> 00:29:46,320
- What?
- I want each of us to take some time...

382
00:29:46,390 --> 00:29:50,584
and think of something that we have
always wanted to tell the other.

383
00:29:51,657 --> 00:29:54,350
Something private, some secret...

384
00:29:54,423 --> 00:29:56,820
some feeling or memory.

385
00:29:56,889 --> 00:30:00,447
It could be anything.
Just as long as it's truthful.

386
00:30:00,523 --> 00:30:03,818
Uh, I don't know
if I'd be good at that kind of game.

387
00:30:03,889 --> 00:30:05,788
Will you try for me?

388
00:30:12,323 --> 00:30:14,255
Um--

389
00:30:25,457 --> 00:30:27,787
I'm waiting.

390
00:30:30,423 --> 00:30:32,888
I never loved your father.

391
00:30:32,956 --> 00:30:34,888
Not for a minute.

392
00:30:36,256 --> 00:30:39,551
Wow. You're good at this.

393
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:46,548
- Why did you marry him?
- Oh.

394
00:30:46,622 --> 00:30:48,645
I was pushing 30.

395
00:30:48,722 --> 00:30:52,586
Back then we called that
a last chance for happiness.

396
00:30:52,656 --> 00:30:56,145
He had a good business.
I remember my mother saying, "Marry him.

397
00:30:56,223 --> 00:30:58,313
He's an undertaker
and will never be out of work.

398
00:30:58,389 --> 00:31:00,288
People will always--"

399
00:31:02,290 --> 00:31:04,221
People will always die.

400
00:31:07,956 --> 00:31:09,888
People will always die.

401
00:31:18,123 --> 00:31:21,179
I hope it's okay for me
to say this, but...

402
00:31:21,255 --> 00:31:24,619
you strike me
as someone who's been...

403
00:31:24,688 --> 00:31:27,086
burned romantically.

404
00:31:28,722 --> 00:31:30,846
Scalded.

405
00:31:30,922 --> 00:31:33,616
Repeatedly.

406
00:31:33,689 --> 00:31:36,917
Married?

407
00:31:36,989 --> 00:31:40,250
- Divorced?
- Yes.

408
00:31:40,322 --> 00:31:42,447
But that was a long time ago...

409
00:31:42,522 --> 00:31:44,784
and, believe it or not,
one of my better experiences.

410
00:31:44,856 --> 00:31:46,787
Let me guess.

411
00:31:46,856 --> 00:31:50,015
Uh, he was either involved
with somebody else...

412
00:31:50,088 --> 00:31:52,213
or gay...

413
00:31:52,289 --> 00:31:54,221
or crazy.

414
00:31:54,288 --> 00:31:56,221
Actually, yes.

415
00:31:57,955 --> 00:32:00,615
Involved with someone else?

416
00:32:00,689 --> 00:32:04,416
- Crazy?
- No. He was gay.

417
00:32:04,489 --> 00:32:06,750
- Wow. Really?
- Yeah.

418
00:32:06,823 --> 00:32:09,549
- I mean, I'm sorry.
- No.

419
00:32:09,621 --> 00:32:11,815
I mean, I'm not sorry. I mean, uh--

420
00:32:13,222 --> 00:32:16,211
- Save me.
- It's okay.

421
00:32:16,288 --> 00:32:18,846
He was a great guy.

422
00:32:18,922 --> 00:32:22,877
I married the boy next door.
Literally. We were 19.

423
00:32:22,955 --> 00:32:25,921
It didn't last very long.
Couldn't, of course.

424
00:32:27,621 --> 00:32:31,348
I haven't seen him in a long time,
but, uh, but we're still friends.

425
00:32:31,422 --> 00:32:35,717
Which is more than I can say for the
parade of total losers that followed.

426
00:32:35,788 --> 00:32:40,379
Are there any, uh,
recent or current losers?

427
00:32:40,455 --> 00:32:42,444
No.

428
00:32:42,521 --> 00:32:46,544
I've been in a holding pattern
where romance is concerned.

429
00:32:46,621 --> 00:32:50,145
- Well, things can change quickly.
- Yeah.

430
00:32:54,721 --> 00:32:57,812
I'm sorry.

431
00:32:57,888 --> 00:33:01,945
This is, uh, going
a little too quickly for me.

432
00:33:03,888 --> 00:33:05,819
I can go slow.

433
00:33:06,987 --> 00:33:08,920
Look, Trent,
you're a nice guy. l--

434
00:33:08,988 --> 00:33:13,080
- Aw! Aw. That's-- You know?
- What?

435
00:33:13,154 --> 00:33:15,586
- I'm swimming ashore.
You can call the Coast Guard.
- Oh, come on.

436
00:33:15,655 --> 00:33:18,053
"Nice guy"? That's--

437
00:33:18,121 --> 00:33:22,486
I haven't been dismissed
with that since high school.

438
00:33:22,554 --> 00:33:25,043
Does that mean no second date?

439
00:33:25,122 --> 00:33:27,451
I have a hard time trusting men.

440
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:31,351
I'm not men.
I'm not a group. Just me.

441
00:33:32,588 --> 00:33:34,985
Who probably has
a lot of women after him.

442
00:33:35,054 --> 00:33:38,248
- So?
- So--

443
00:33:38,321 --> 00:33:40,913
Look, you know,
you seem to want honesty...

444
00:33:40,987 --> 00:33:42,919
so I'll be honest with you.

445
00:33:42,987 --> 00:33:45,146
I don't really have
a problem getting dates.

446
00:33:45,221 --> 00:33:48,744
But I'm 38 years old.
I don't just want dates anymore.

447
00:33:48,822 --> 00:33:51,286
I'll tell you what I don't want.

448
00:33:51,354 --> 00:33:54,718
I don't want all of
this calculated artificiality.

449
00:33:54,787 --> 00:33:59,879
This isn't me, Trent--
this dress, the stupid little bows
in my hair. And look at you.

450
00:33:59,954 --> 00:34:03,943
I mean, I don't imagine you sit around
your house in an Armani suit. Do you?

451
00:34:04,021 --> 00:34:07,418
No. My house is black-tie.

452
00:34:13,887 --> 00:34:16,410
- Look, I'm sorry, but--
- I know, you have to go.

453
00:34:16,487 --> 00:34:19,851
- I'm already-- Jesus-- two hours late.
- You're leavin' me too.

454
00:34:19,921 --> 00:34:22,716
It's okay. Really.
Just go. Go.

455
00:34:22,787 --> 00:34:26,947
- Until the day I die,
I'll remember that story.
- Yeah, listen. Listen.

456
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:31,112
You have been swell,
listening to me like this.

457
00:34:31,187 --> 00:34:35,711
Bet you'll think twice about striking up
a conversation in this bar again, huh?

458
00:34:35,786 --> 00:34:38,150
Take care. All right?

459
00:34:38,220 --> 00:34:40,686
- For once I really, really mean that.
- Yeah.

460
00:34:40,754 --> 00:34:43,117
- Good-bye.
- Bye.

461
00:34:48,921 --> 00:34:50,852
Taxi money.

462
00:34:50,921 --> 00:34:53,386
Don't even think of allowing
that guy to drive.

463
00:34:53,454 --> 00:34:56,147
I'm a lawyer.
I'll hunt you down.

464
00:35:02,687 --> 00:35:04,982
Look, Trent...

465
00:35:05,054 --> 00:35:08,348
if by some miracle,
after this explosion of neuroses...

466
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:10,817
you still want to see me,
we can start from the top.

467
00:35:10,887 --> 00:35:13,317
You can cook dinner
for me Tuesday.

468
00:35:14,553 --> 00:35:16,985
- Okay.
- Good.

469
00:35:18,187 --> 00:35:20,619
- Tuesday.
- Yeah.

470
00:35:20,686 --> 00:35:23,847
- You can come to my apartment.
- Okay.

471
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:27,079
Meet my better half.

472
00:35:27,153 --> 00:35:31,551
- Better half?
- Yeah. My dog. Barley.

473
00:35:31,619 --> 00:35:34,347
Your dog Barley? That'd be great.
I'd love to meet Barley.

474
00:35:34,419 --> 00:35:36,352
- Good.
- I'll bring the wine.

475
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:38,544
- Great.
- Good.

476
00:35:38,619 --> 00:35:41,210
- Tuesday night.
- Absolutely.

477
00:35:41,287 --> 00:35:45,049
You know, Meredith,
those stupid little bows?

478
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:48,052
I think they're adorable.

479
00:37:05,885 --> 00:37:08,851
Why did you stay with him?

480
00:37:08,919 --> 00:37:12,181
Well, you.

481
00:37:12,252 --> 00:37:16,411
I guess I was the last generation
of women who actually did that.

482
00:37:16,485 --> 00:37:20,247
It never even occurred to me
to get a divorce.

483
00:37:20,318 --> 00:37:24,341
I was so relieved when he died.

484
00:37:24,418 --> 00:37:29,749
- Don't hold anything back, Mom.
- Mmm.

485
00:37:29,819 --> 00:37:33,774
Ah, I like this
new spirit of frankness.

486
00:37:33,852 --> 00:37:36,409
It's oddly cleansing.

487
00:37:47,251 --> 00:37:49,911
I want to know
what you're like away from me here.

488
00:37:49,985 --> 00:37:54,145
That can't happen. The fact that you and
I aren't involved beyond this room...

489
00:37:54,218 --> 00:37:56,548
is what-- ahh-- appeals to me.

490
00:37:56,618 --> 00:38:00,607
You know how to play
your role damn well.

491
00:38:00,684 --> 00:38:03,378
Guilty as charged.

492
00:38:12,118 --> 00:38:16,380
- Roger, what do you want?
- I don't want much.

493
00:38:16,452 --> 00:38:19,577
I just want more of you.

494
00:38:21,618 --> 00:38:23,549
I can't give you that.

495
00:38:26,152 --> 00:38:29,776
Roger.
Don't be an anger ball.

496
00:38:29,851 --> 00:38:31,783
"An anger ball"?

497
00:38:33,385 --> 00:38:36,782
Don't you see?
What's great about you and me...

498
00:38:36,851 --> 00:38:41,682
right here, this very moment,
is that we don't come through
that door with a lot of baggage.

499
00:38:41,751 --> 00:38:45,513
We don't come through that door
with any baggage at all.

500
00:38:45,584 --> 00:38:49,540
And aren't we lucky?
We don't bring anything in...

501
00:38:49,617 --> 00:38:52,913
and we don't take anything out.

502
00:38:58,717 --> 00:39:08,480
%

503
00:39:08,551 --> 00:39:11,245
You're not the only one
who can dance alone.

504
00:39:11,317 --> 00:39:15,249
- What?
- I said you look like
a man in need of a Coke.

505
00:39:19,417 --> 00:39:22,111
%

506
00:39:24,951 --> 00:39:28,247
Uh, my friend here will have a Coke,
and I'll have a--

507
00:39:28,317 --> 00:39:32,011
Vodka martini,
very dry, three olives.

508
00:39:32,084 --> 00:39:34,016
Good memory.

509
00:39:34,084 --> 00:39:37,243
My mind has an endless capacity
for useless information.

510
00:39:39,750 --> 00:39:42,410
I've had a terrible day.

511
00:39:42,484 --> 00:39:45,848
I know we were talking about you for
a moment there, but my day was so bad.

512
00:39:45,917 --> 00:39:48,383
"How bad was it?" you might ask.

513
00:39:48,451 --> 00:39:51,473
-l might if you gave me the opportunity.
-l was saving you the effort...

514
00:39:51,551 --> 00:39:54,483
so that after I tell you my tale of woe
we can move on to happier topics.

515
00:39:54,551 --> 00:39:58,313
Perhaps one of your choosing. Anyway,
I'm an actress. Did I tell you that?

516
00:39:58,384 --> 00:40:02,749
- No. But I'm not surprised.
- I had this monologue in class today.

517
00:40:02,818 --> 00:40:06,476
And I was prepared.
You know, I mean, like really prepared.

518
00:40:06,551 --> 00:40:08,880
You know Suddenly Last Summer
by Tennessee Williams?

519
00:40:08,950 --> 00:40:12,575
- No.
- Oh, it's one of my favorites.
Great story.

520
00:40:12,650 --> 00:40:15,344
It's about this girl, Katherine-- moi--

521
00:40:15,417 --> 00:40:19,144
who is slated for a lobotomy
because the mother of her cousin
wants to keep her mouth shut...

522
00:40:19,217 --> 00:40:22,614
about certain goings-on involving
the old lady's son Sebastian.

523
00:40:22,683 --> 00:40:26,809
You see, the women sort of pimp
for Cousin Sebastian.
Are you following this?

524
00:40:26,883 --> 00:40:28,678
- Amazingly, yes.
- Anyway, it turns out...

525
00:40:28,750 --> 00:40:32,842
on their travels together Cousin
Sebastian liked to troll the beaches...

526
00:40:32,917 --> 00:40:37,373
looking for young native boys
in order to satisfy his base instincts.

527
00:40:37,451 --> 00:40:40,177
One hot afternoon in Cartagena...

528
00:40:40,250 --> 00:40:43,909
the boys decide they have had quite
enough of Sebastian's shenanigans...

529
00:40:43,983 --> 00:40:47,416
and they--
well, they eat him.

530
00:40:47,483 --> 00:40:51,006
- You mean metaphorically.
- No. They really eat him.

531
00:40:51,083 --> 00:40:55,742
They devour him.
In short, he's lunch.

532
00:40:55,817 --> 00:40:58,681
And Katherine witnesses
every course...

533
00:40:58,750 --> 00:41:01,080
from soup to nuts.

534
00:41:01,150 --> 00:41:03,377
If you'll pardon the expression.

535
00:41:03,450 --> 00:41:06,974
Anyway, I'm about to do
this killer monologue. I'm up next--

536
00:41:07,050 --> 00:41:10,607
If one more actor saunters
into this class...

537
00:41:10,683 --> 00:41:15,479
and recites Katherine's "native boys
ate my cousin Sebastian" speech...

538
00:41:15,550 --> 00:41:17,743
from Suddenly Last Summer...

539
00:41:17,817 --> 00:41:20,681
I am going to puke.

540
00:41:20,750 --> 00:41:24,113
Now, who is up next?

541
00:41:25,450 --> 00:41:29,439
Um... Joan! You're on.

542
00:41:30,916 --> 00:41:34,576
The teacher didn't lose
his lunch. I did.

543
00:41:35,650 --> 00:41:38,411
- I'm sorry.
- So am l.

544
00:41:41,283 --> 00:41:45,443
Now, on to happier topics, I promise.
How about a movie?

545
00:41:45,515 --> 00:41:47,345
- I told you.
- I know.

546
00:41:47,416 --> 00:41:50,246
I know. You don't date.
Is it a religious thing?

547
00:41:50,316 --> 00:41:54,373
- No.
- Well, you like movies, don't you?

548
00:41:54,450 --> 00:41:56,381
- They're okay.
- How about tomorrow night?

549
00:41:56,450 --> 00:41:59,245
It doesn't have to be a date.
We'll meet at the theater.

550
00:42:00,949 --> 00:42:04,574
- I don't know.
- Look. I'll make it easy.
Okay, blue boy?

551
00:42:04,649 --> 00:42:08,479
Tomorrow night I'm going to the
late show of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre
at the Sunset Five.

552
00:42:08,550 --> 00:42:11,482
If you decide you would like to
join the human race, meet me there.

553
00:42:16,949 --> 00:42:21,278
Uh, now, in other news, they found
a cure for cancer. Okay. Uh, moving on.

554
00:42:21,348 --> 00:42:24,473
- No, they--
- Do you ever hear from Wendy?

555
00:42:24,549 --> 00:42:28,141
What on Earth made you think of Wendy?

556
00:42:28,216 --> 00:42:32,807
- Oh, I don't know.
Just thinking about the old days.
- Yes.

557
00:42:32,882 --> 00:42:35,280
Very old. Ancient.

558
00:42:36,916 --> 00:42:41,712
Well, do you?
Do you ever hear from her?

559
00:42:41,781 --> 00:42:43,714
Any reason I should?

560
00:42:43,782 --> 00:42:47,306
Any reason you should keep
her picture in your desk?

561
00:42:50,183 --> 00:42:54,410
None that you should
concern yourself with.

562
00:42:54,482 --> 00:42:59,107
Viagra. Oh, God.

563
00:42:59,182 --> 00:43:03,047
Viagra. That's what everyone's
talking about. Are you on it yet?

564
00:43:03,116 --> 00:43:05,274
Just the men.
Okay, uh, well...

565
00:43:05,348 --> 00:43:07,575
it's so successful,
you know, of course--

566
00:43:17,948 --> 00:43:19,880
- Hey. I made it.
- Hi.

567
00:43:19,948 --> 00:43:24,074
- Uh, casually attired.
- Wow.

568
00:43:24,148 --> 00:43:26,580
Yeah, I know. The flowers are
a little much, and I'm late.

569
00:43:26,648 --> 00:43:28,773
But only because I had second thoughts
about the flowers...

570
00:43:28,849 --> 00:43:31,871
and I threw them away halfway down the
block, and then I had third thoughts...

571
00:43:31,948 --> 00:43:33,971
and went back and got them.

572
00:43:34,048 --> 00:43:36,309
Well, I'm glad you did.

573
00:43:36,382 --> 00:43:38,677
Thank you.

574
00:43:38,748 --> 00:43:40,680
Come in.
Come in, come in, come in.

575
00:43:40,748 --> 00:43:44,874
- Thanks.
- l, uh-- I hope you like Italian.

576
00:43:44,948 --> 00:43:47,140
- I hope you like merlot.
- I do.

577
00:43:47,215 --> 00:43:49,237
Wow! That's a--

578
00:43:49,315 --> 00:43:51,246
- Barley.
- That's some dog! That's, uh--

579
00:43:51,314 --> 00:43:54,542
- Barley, get down, sweetie.
Come on. Come on.
- Whoa.

580
00:43:54,614 --> 00:43:57,240
- My family has a thing for pets.
- Yeah. Oh.

581
00:43:57,315 --> 00:43:59,780
That's, uh--
That's certainly impressive.

582
00:43:59,848 --> 00:44:04,372
Suddenly I'm feeling
a little inadequate. That's--

583
00:44:05,448 --> 00:44:08,074
I, uh-- It's almost ready.
I, uh--

584
00:44:08,148 --> 00:44:12,807
Sorry that took me so long. I was
on the phone with one of my sisters.

585
00:44:14,114 --> 00:44:17,638
- The married one.
- The one who's having an affair?

586
00:44:17,714 --> 00:44:19,941
Yeah, well, the one
who's always having an affair.

587
00:44:20,014 --> 00:44:22,277
Her husband doesn't
suspect anything?

588
00:44:22,347 --> 00:44:25,973
Her husband is sweet,
but he's a bit dim.

589
00:44:27,514 --> 00:44:30,106
He doesn't have
much of an imagination.

590
00:44:30,182 --> 00:44:33,114
Chandler girls like their men
with imagination?

591
00:44:33,181 --> 00:44:35,477
Yeah. It helps.

592
00:44:36,815 --> 00:44:41,076
You know, I'm told
I have a good imagination.

593
00:44:43,081 --> 00:44:45,273
I don't want
to have sex tonight.

594
00:44:48,980 --> 00:44:52,310
- Okay.
- I mean if that's why you thought
I invited you over here--

595
00:44:52,381 --> 00:44:54,506
- I invited myself over here.
- Well, whatever.

596
00:44:54,580 --> 00:44:57,570
- I mean, I know that
must be kind of unusual.
- It's not unusual. l--

597
00:44:57,648 --> 00:44:59,579
I mean, I'm sure that most women
don't turn you down.

598
00:44:59,648 --> 00:45:02,045
Meredith, can we talk about
something else?

599
00:45:02,114 --> 00:45:04,740
Honestly, sex is the last thing
on my mind right now.

600
00:45:04,814 --> 00:45:07,042
- Okay, okay.
- Okay?

601
00:45:07,115 --> 00:45:10,274
Okay. Okay.

602
00:45:10,346 --> 00:45:13,904
Want a taste? I mean, l-I'm sorry
if I ruined your plans. That's all.

603
00:45:13,980 --> 00:45:16,912
I didn't have any plans!
I just think--

604
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:19,412
You know, you've got
a few too many rules working for you...

605
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:22,446
and way too many rules
workin' against me!

606
00:45:22,513 --> 00:45:25,707
I really like you, but--

607
00:45:25,780 --> 00:45:28,372
This kind of thing
is pissing me off.

608
00:45:31,780 --> 00:45:34,541
Maybe this wasn't such a good idea.

609
00:45:37,647 --> 00:45:40,772
I can't understand why you haven't had
a relationship lately.

610
00:45:43,780 --> 00:45:47,473
Really?
Well, that doesn't take long, does it?

611
00:45:47,548 --> 00:45:49,775
- What doesn't?
- I mean, you turn a guy down...

612
00:45:49,847 --> 00:45:52,972
a-and wham, he just metamorphoses
into an anger ball.

613
00:45:53,047 --> 00:45:55,205
- "Anger ball"?
- See?

614
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:58,712
All I said was
I have a good imagination.

615
00:45:58,780 --> 00:46:01,973
- I wasn't talking about sex.
- Really.

616
00:46:02,046 --> 00:46:05,036
I've had enough... sex.

617
00:46:05,114 --> 00:46:07,045
Mostly with women
I didn't really like...

618
00:46:07,114 --> 00:46:10,375
a-and probably
didn't really like me.

619
00:46:12,879 --> 00:46:15,073
Call me nuts, man,
but l-- I like you.

620
00:46:15,146 --> 00:46:17,475
And...

621
00:46:17,547 --> 00:46:21,035
yeah, if something happens between us,
sex will probably enter into it.

622
00:46:21,113 --> 00:46:24,909
But not until you break
the brick wall down around yourself...

623
00:46:24,980 --> 00:46:28,310
and certainly not tonight.

624
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:33,212
Are you finished?

625
00:46:34,313 --> 00:46:36,779
- Yeah.
- I'll show you out.

626
00:46:38,380 --> 00:46:41,937
- What!
- Look, this is exactly
what I don't want.

627
00:46:42,013 --> 00:46:43,911
- Somebody being straight with you?
- Yes!

628
00:46:43,979 --> 00:46:47,207
Yes, yes.

629
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:51,803
You know what, Trent?
I do not have the stamina for this.

630
00:46:51,879 --> 00:46:53,811
I don't.

631
00:46:53,879 --> 00:46:56,811
- Meredith, we haven't
even started anything.
- You know what?

632
00:46:56,879 --> 00:47:00,539
We're not going to.

633
00:47:00,612 --> 00:47:04,272
Because let me just jump ahead
to the inevitable. Okay?

634
00:47:05,345 --> 00:47:07,278
We get together.

635
00:47:07,345 --> 00:47:10,311
You hurt me.
It ends badly.

636
00:47:10,380 --> 00:47:14,540
That's a really depressing way
to look at a fledgling relationship.

637
00:47:14,613 --> 00:47:17,976
Well, there's nothing
fledgling about it.

638
00:47:18,046 --> 00:47:20,944
And honestly, that is
the only viewpoint that I have.

639
00:47:23,913 --> 00:47:27,709
Then I feel sorry for you,
Meredith, because I didn't
come over here to hurt you.

640
00:47:33,346 --> 00:47:36,709
- I hope Barley likes Italian.
- He does.

641
00:47:51,345 --> 00:47:53,072
What?

642
00:48:04,878 --> 00:48:07,310
What are you watching?

643
00:48:07,379 --> 00:48:09,641
Midnight Lace.

644
00:48:09,712 --> 00:48:13,144
Ah. Doris Day.

645
00:48:13,212 --> 00:48:15,804
Oh, yeah. That's the one
where she thinks she's going crazy...

646
00:48:15,879 --> 00:48:18,571
but it's really her husband
that's driving her to suicide...

647
00:48:18,645 --> 00:48:20,634
for her money.

648
00:48:20,711 --> 00:48:23,234
Well, thank you, Paul!

649
00:48:23,312 --> 00:48:26,744
Why don't you just go-- go find
a theater that's showing Citizen Kane...

650
00:48:26,812 --> 00:48:29,403
and yell out
"Rosebud is a sled"?

651
00:48:29,479 --> 00:48:31,944
- I'm sorry.
I thought you'd seen it before.
- Well, I hadn't.

652
00:48:32,012 --> 00:48:34,375
I mean, I thought we'd seen it before.

653
00:48:34,445 --> 00:48:37,037
Perhaps you have me confused
with Wendy.

654
00:48:37,112 --> 00:48:39,043
So that's what this is all about.

655
00:48:39,112 --> 00:48:43,567
- What "this"? There isn't any "this."
- No? No "this"?

656
00:48:43,646 --> 00:48:45,702
Do you normally speak
through clenched teeth?

657
00:48:45,778 --> 00:48:48,608
I'm not speaking any different
than normal.

658
00:48:48,679 --> 00:48:51,236
- Differently.
- Oh!

659
00:49:02,208 --> 00:49:04,141
You are being idiotic.

660
00:49:04,209 --> 00:49:08,800
Well, you wouldn't want me to act
any different than normal, would you?

661
00:49:08,875 --> 00:49:12,238
- "Differently."
- This isn't exactly what I had in mind.

662
00:49:12,308 --> 00:49:14,796
- Do you still see her?
- Who?

663
00:49:14,875 --> 00:49:17,705
"Who?" Who?
Doris Day!

664
00:49:17,775 --> 00:49:20,298
Oh, you mean Wendy.

665
00:49:20,375 --> 00:49:22,967
You thought I didn't know,
didn't you?

666
00:49:23,041 --> 00:49:26,633
You think the little woman doesn't know
when her husband has an affair.

667
00:49:26,708 --> 00:49:31,367
Hannah, it was 25 years ago,
and it wasn't an affair.

668
00:49:31,442 --> 00:49:33,635
Oh, don't insult my intelligence.

669
00:49:33,708 --> 00:49:37,299
Your intelligence, at the moment,
is in serious doubt.

670
00:49:37,375 --> 00:49:40,136
- Screw you!
- Hannah.

671
00:49:40,208 --> 00:49:42,696
Paul.

672
00:49:49,042 --> 00:49:53,303
Do you really want
to talk about this? Hmm?

673
00:49:53,375 --> 00:49:58,568
Because if you do, I'll tell you
everything you want to know.

674
00:49:58,642 --> 00:50:01,574
You might start
by being honest with me.

675
00:50:01,642 --> 00:50:04,437
- It wasn't an affair?
- It wasn't.

676
00:50:04,508 --> 00:50:09,099
- I never slept with Wendy.
- Oh, please!

677
00:50:09,175 --> 00:50:11,573
Hey, calm down.
You're overwrought.

678
00:50:11,642 --> 00:50:13,903
I am perfectly wrought.

679
00:50:13,974 --> 00:50:17,065
Given the circumstances,
I'm even a bit underwrought.

680
00:50:17,141 --> 00:50:19,902
- There's no such word.
- There is now.

681
00:50:21,808 --> 00:50:25,740
Do you want to know...
why I didn't sleep with Wendy?

682
00:50:31,841 --> 00:50:34,932
I am, as they say, all ears.

683
00:50:35,008 --> 00:50:38,440
Well, I never
slept with Wendy...

684
00:50:38,507 --> 00:50:41,497
because I was
too much in love with her.

685
00:50:43,907 --> 00:50:45,840
Oh.

686
00:50:50,674 --> 00:50:53,867
You couldn't have died
without telling me that?

687
00:51:07,607 --> 00:51:09,869
Keenan? You going out?

688
00:51:09,941 --> 00:51:13,532
Yes, Dad.

689
00:51:17,940 --> 00:51:20,702
Hi. I know for this technically
not to be a date...

690
00:51:20,774 --> 00:51:24,206
we should have gone dutch, but the
tickets were selling out so fast, so--

691
00:51:24,274 --> 00:51:27,297
What would you have done
if I didn't show up?

692
00:51:27,374 --> 00:51:29,863
Um, well, after I recovered from
the supreme disappointment...

693
00:51:29,940 --> 00:51:32,532
and picked up the pieces
of my fractured ego...

694
00:51:32,606 --> 00:51:36,368
I would have run down the escalator and
invited the guy standing on the corner.

695
00:51:36,441 --> 00:51:38,373
You know, the one holding the sign.

696
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:41,033
The one that says,
"Will work for food"?

697
00:51:41,107 --> 00:51:44,369
Or a movie.
You should have read the fine print.

698
00:51:47,774 --> 00:51:50,534
% I'll plant my own tree %

699
00:51:50,607 --> 00:51:54,299
% And I'll make it grow %

700
00:51:54,374 --> 00:51:57,135
% My tree will not be %

701
00:51:57,206 --> 00:52:01,105
% Just one in a row %

702
00:52:01,174 --> 00:52:04,140
% My tree will offer shade %

703
00:52:04,206 --> 00:52:08,003
% When strangers go by %

704
00:52:08,072 --> 00:52:10,301
% If you're a stranger %

705
00:52:10,373 --> 00:52:12,635
% Brother, well, so am I %

706
00:52:12,706 --> 00:52:14,672
Gin gimlet, rocks.

707
00:52:14,741 --> 00:52:16,672
Make it two.

708
00:52:16,740 --> 00:52:18,797
- I'm Lana.
- Hugh.

709
00:52:18,872 --> 00:52:21,498
I haven't seen you here before.

710
00:52:21,573 --> 00:52:25,301
- Well, how do you know that?
- Honey, you sounded
like John Wayne in a bathhouse.

711
00:52:25,373 --> 00:52:28,305
Well, as a matter of fact,
this is my first time here.

712
00:52:28,373 --> 00:52:31,635
I'm 28 years old,
in case you're wondering.

713
00:52:31,706 --> 00:52:34,467
And that's in real years,
not Heather Locklear years.

714
00:52:34,540 --> 00:52:36,506
I'm also a drag queen.

715
00:52:36,573 --> 00:52:40,471
- I think I figured that out.
- Well, I just didn't want
there to be any misunderstanding.

716
00:52:40,540 --> 00:52:42,768
This ain't no disco, and I don't want
no Crying Game confusion.

717
00:52:42,840 --> 00:52:45,635
I want it understood up front,
I may be a fabulous-looking broad...

718
00:52:45,706 --> 00:52:47,638
but I've got a penis.

719
00:52:47,706 --> 00:52:50,638
- So do l.
- Well, then we'll get along just fine.

720
00:52:50,706 --> 00:52:54,729
So you come on and tell Lana what
the fuck you're doing in this place.

721
00:52:54,807 --> 00:52:59,068
Um... I had a...
fight with my wife.

722
00:52:59,139 --> 00:53:01,571
- Old story.
- Well, it's an old story...

723
00:53:01,640 --> 00:53:04,231
but it's a newish twist.

724
00:53:04,306 --> 00:53:07,238
"Newish twist"? Damn, that's a bitch
to say with my sibilance.

725
00:53:07,306 --> 00:53:09,238
I'll have to roll that one
around my tongue later.

726
00:53:09,306 --> 00:53:13,636
Unless you got better ideas.
"Newish twist." Continue.

727
00:53:13,705 --> 00:53:18,001
My wife discovered
I was stepping out on her.

728
00:53:18,072 --> 00:53:19,970
When does the "newish" part come in?

729
00:53:20,039 --> 00:53:21,971
That one's older
than Lauren Bacall.

730
00:53:22,039 --> 00:53:25,402
Well, I-I cheated on my wife...

731
00:53:25,472 --> 00:53:28,064
with her brother.

732
00:53:28,139 --> 00:53:32,730
Make that a double, and keep 'em coming.

733
00:53:32,806 --> 00:53:35,238
% It's impossible
Tell you right now %

734
00:53:35,306 --> 00:53:37,771
% If I tried it
I'd never know how %

735
00:53:37,839 --> 00:53:41,203
He's her younger brother. Sam.

736
00:53:41,272 --> 00:53:44,068
I knew he was gay, of course.
You can always tell.

737
00:53:44,139 --> 00:53:46,401
It's called "gay-dar."

738
00:53:46,473 --> 00:53:49,064
- I'm not gay or anything.
- No, no, no.

739
00:53:49,138 --> 00:53:51,071
Of course not.

740
00:53:51,139 --> 00:53:54,071
It's just something about him.

741
00:53:54,138 --> 00:53:58,400
He always looked at me
like he could see right inside me...

742
00:53:58,473 --> 00:54:00,404
to my true soul.

743
00:54:12,405 --> 00:54:15,837
Don't look at me
with that tone of voice.

744
00:54:19,405 --> 00:54:23,769
Let me...
try and explain this.

745
00:54:23,839 --> 00:54:27,827
Wendy came along at a time
when I needed somebody.

746
00:54:27,905 --> 00:54:33,668
If this is supposed to be making me
feel better, you're failing miserably.

747
00:54:33,738 --> 00:54:35,829
It didn't mean
that I didn't love you.

748
00:54:35,906 --> 00:54:38,098
In fact, it meant that I did love you.

749
00:54:38,172 --> 00:54:40,331
Well...

750
00:54:40,405 --> 00:54:44,996
you seem to have been loving
a lot of people right about then:

751
00:54:45,072 --> 00:54:47,333
the kids...

752
00:54:47,405 --> 00:54:50,337
Wendy, me.

753
00:54:50,404 --> 00:54:52,394
Anybody else?

754
00:54:52,471 --> 00:54:54,937
Hannah, we've been married
for 40 years.

755
00:54:55,005 --> 00:54:57,766
There were some rough times.
Admit it.

756
00:54:57,838 --> 00:55:00,270
Oh, I admit it.

757
00:55:00,338 --> 00:55:03,270
This is one of them.

758
00:55:03,337 --> 00:55:06,599
You know I spent a lot of time
that summer with Wendy.

759
00:55:06,671 --> 00:55:09,933
Our production company
did throw us together.

760
00:55:10,005 --> 00:55:12,597
If I remember correctly, I hired her.

761
00:55:12,671 --> 00:55:17,103
Right. We were launching
your first show.

762
00:55:17,172 --> 00:55:20,604
And... well, Wendy was a big help.

763
00:55:20,671 --> 00:55:22,728
Oh, I'll bet.

764
00:55:26,338 --> 00:55:29,098
- Were you really in love with her?
- Yes.

765
00:55:29,171 --> 00:55:33,104
Yeah, I was.
I remember wishing then that I wasn't.

766
00:55:33,172 --> 00:55:35,364
I couldn't think straight
for a whole year.

767
00:55:37,004 --> 00:55:40,767
- That's when you lost all that weight.
- Yes.

768
00:55:40,837 --> 00:55:44,601
- I thought it was overwork.
- It was Wendy.

769
00:55:47,172 --> 00:55:49,603
- I didn't love you any less.
- Oh, don't.

770
00:55:49,671 --> 00:55:51,762
- I didn't.
- Don't.

771
00:55:51,838 --> 00:55:55,463
I just loved her...

772
00:55:55,538 --> 00:55:57,470
differently.

773
00:55:57,538 --> 00:55:59,470
Differently.

774
00:55:59,538 --> 00:56:01,470
Mm-hmm.

775
00:56:03,771 --> 00:56:06,396
And you really didn't
sleep with her?

776
00:56:06,471 --> 00:56:08,403
No.

777
00:56:09,771 --> 00:56:12,532
Of course not.

778
00:56:12,604 --> 00:56:15,866
And you didn't want
to sleep with her?

779
00:56:15,938 --> 00:56:18,529
Oh, good God, yes, I did.

780
00:56:21,271 --> 00:56:25,431
You bastard.
You bastard!

781
00:56:25,504 --> 00:56:27,527
What--

782
00:56:27,604 --> 00:56:29,865
- Hey!
- Just don't touch me! Just--

783
00:56:29,937 --> 00:56:32,529
I've had it!

784
00:56:32,604 --> 00:56:34,661
Well, you did ask.

785
00:56:37,938 --> 00:56:39,869
Oh, boy.

786
00:56:51,438 --> 00:56:54,960
A couple times during the movie
I thought you ducked out on me.

787
00:56:55,037 --> 00:56:56,969
I had to use the bathroom.

788
00:56:57,036 --> 00:57:00,298
Well, at crucial times like
these, you should inform a girl
about having a small bladder.

789
00:57:00,370 --> 00:57:03,132
It saves her
from abandonment fantasies.

790
00:57:03,203 --> 00:57:06,637
Would it help at all
if I told you I didn't sit down to pee?

791
00:57:06,703 --> 00:57:09,295
In this theater,
I don't sit down to pee.

792
00:57:16,870 --> 00:57:18,802
Going dancing?

793
00:57:18,870 --> 00:57:20,961
Maybe.

794
00:57:21,037 --> 00:57:23,299
I'm not asking
to go with you, you know.

795
00:57:23,371 --> 00:57:25,802
We can take this slowly.

796
00:57:25,870 --> 00:57:28,960
Joan, this isn't anything.

797
00:57:29,036 --> 00:57:32,628
It's not anything now,
and it won't be anything ever.

798
00:57:32,703 --> 00:57:37,965
Wow. Message received.
End of date.

799
00:57:38,037 --> 00:57:40,298
- I'll walk you to your car.
- Oh, that's so sweet.

800
00:57:40,371 --> 00:57:42,302
That is so sweet.
He never wants to see her again...

801
00:57:42,370 --> 00:57:44,962
but he doesn't want her to be
dismembered in the underground parking.

802
00:57:45,037 --> 00:57:48,968
- Where are you parked?
- On the "Artist formerly
known as Prince" level.

803
00:57:57,170 --> 00:57:59,897
Which one is yours?

804
00:57:59,970 --> 00:58:02,561
The V.W. in space 23.

805
00:58:02,637 --> 00:58:06,069
Uh, there's nothing in space 23.

806
00:58:06,136 --> 00:58:08,068
Really?

807
00:58:11,969 --> 00:58:14,595
Shit!
Shit!

808
00:58:14,670 --> 00:58:17,898
Shit! Shit!
Shit! Shit!

809
00:58:17,969 --> 00:58:20,333
Shit!
I cannot believe this!

810
00:58:20,403 --> 00:58:22,334
I cannot believe this!

811
00:58:22,402 --> 00:58:24,335
Maybe you remembered wrong. Maybe
you're on the Rolling Stones level.

812
00:58:24,402 --> 00:58:26,834
- No!
- The Madonna level?

813
00:58:26,903 --> 00:58:30,995
- I wouldn't be caught dead
on the Madonna level.
- We'll call the police.

814
00:58:31,069 --> 00:58:35,058
- I'm sure they'll be able to find it.
- I can't fucking believe this!

815
00:58:36,637 --> 00:58:39,102
My parents bought me that car.

816
00:58:39,170 --> 00:58:41,101
Joan, don't--

817
00:58:41,170 --> 00:58:43,102
What?
Don't what?

818
00:58:43,169 --> 00:58:46,363
Don't cry?
I don't fucking cry.

819
00:58:46,436 --> 00:58:48,369
It's something
of a thing with me.

820
00:58:50,903 --> 00:58:59,563
%

821
00:58:59,636 --> 00:59:01,897
It's very... nice.

822
00:59:01,969 --> 00:59:06,765
It's a hole, but it suits
me and Blanche just dandy.

823
00:59:06,836 --> 00:59:08,631
Speaking of Blanche--

824
00:59:08,702 --> 00:59:11,259
Jesus!

825
00:59:11,335 --> 00:59:14,665
- You scared her.
- That's the ugliest cat I've ever seen.

826
00:59:14,736 --> 00:59:17,566
- She's an angel.
- She only has one eye.

827
00:59:17,636 --> 00:59:21,796
Yeah, but it's her good one. Come on,
Blanche. That mean man won't hurt you.

828
00:59:21,868 --> 00:59:23,767
Um, I should--
I should be going.

829
00:59:23,836 --> 00:59:25,358
- I can make coffee.
- I don't drink coffee.

830
00:59:26,469 --> 00:59:28,833
He doesn't drink coffee.

831
00:59:29,969 --> 00:59:32,400
- Ovaltine?
- I don't want to--

832
00:59:32,469 --> 00:59:36,060
You don't want to be mean.
Go ahead.

833
00:59:36,136 --> 00:59:38,896
You're terrific.

834
00:59:38,968 --> 00:59:40,900
Sensational, really.

835
00:59:40,968 --> 00:59:43,934
- But I'm not right for you.
- Wow.

836
00:59:44,002 --> 00:59:46,560
You should write
these kiss-offs down.

837
00:59:46,636 --> 00:59:50,260
They'd be perfect for a chapter
called, "Piercing the heart
in exactly ten words."

838
00:59:50,335 --> 00:59:52,267
That was ten words, wasn't it?

839
00:59:52,334 --> 00:59:56,631
"You are terrific. Sensational, really.
But I'm not right for you." Yep.

840
00:59:56,701 --> 00:59:59,326
I can't say any more
except for that l-I'm sorry...

841
00:59:59,401 --> 01:00:02,129
and... um... good-bye.

842
01:00:02,202 --> 01:00:05,656
Good-bye or good night?

843
01:00:05,736 --> 01:00:07,667
Good-bye.

844
01:00:15,902 --> 01:00:18,663
Hey.

845
01:00:18,735 --> 01:00:21,997
Hi. No, you did it
all perfectly.

846
01:00:22,068 --> 01:00:24,159
I'll pick up the car tomorrow.

847
01:00:24,234 --> 01:00:27,496
No, you won't be meeting him.
It didn't work out.

848
01:00:27,568 --> 01:00:31,330
Oh, how should I put this.
He's virtually non compos mentis.

849
01:00:31,401 --> 01:00:33,333
Any resemblance
between any real person...

850
01:00:33,401 --> 01:00:36,299
living or dead,
is purely coincidental.

851
01:00:37,568 --> 01:00:39,500
You want more?

852
01:00:39,568 --> 01:00:42,330
Well, the lad doesn't say much,
and when he does...

853
01:00:42,402 --> 01:00:46,663
he finds just the right words
to crush my soul.

854
01:00:46,735 --> 01:00:48,667
Of course I'm crazy about him.

855
01:00:52,068 --> 01:00:55,897
- Last call!
- We'll have two more apiece.

856
01:00:57,002 --> 01:00:59,093
No... you won't.

857
01:01:00,201 --> 01:01:05,099
%

858
01:01:06,168 --> 01:01:09,157
So, honey...
what's next for you?

859
01:01:10,501 --> 01:01:13,433
I am going to call a taxi...

860
01:01:13,500 --> 01:01:15,490
and tell him to take me--

861
01:01:15,567 --> 01:01:17,500
- Let me guess. Sam's place.
- Sam's place.

862
01:01:17,568 --> 01:01:19,557
Exactly.

863
01:01:19,634 --> 01:01:21,965
Can I tell you something?

864
01:01:22,034 --> 01:01:24,262
I told you everything.

865
01:01:24,333 --> 01:01:26,424
You can tell me anything.

866
01:01:26,501 --> 01:01:29,058
I have had a good time
with you, darlin'.

867
01:01:29,134 --> 01:01:32,588
Right entertaining, it was.

868
01:01:32,667 --> 01:01:34,599
But, sweetie...

869
01:01:34,667 --> 01:01:37,031
who the fuck do you
think you're kidding?

870
01:01:38,568 --> 01:01:40,499
What do you mean?

871
01:01:42,567 --> 01:01:45,431
Lana may be three sheets
to the proverbial wind...

872
01:01:45,500 --> 01:01:47,591
but I don't believe a word...

873
01:01:47,667 --> 01:01:52,100
out of your pretty,
straight-ass mouth.

874
01:01:54,201 --> 01:01:56,133
Nighty-night.

875
01:02:02,767 --> 01:02:05,528
Taxis.

876
01:02:05,601 --> 01:02:09,191
Or... I get off in ten minutes.

877
01:03:03,699 --> 01:03:05,790
Gracie--

878
01:03:05,866 --> 01:03:08,957
You don't have to say anything, Roger.

879
01:03:10,367 --> 01:03:12,299
It's been fun.

880
01:03:14,533 --> 01:03:16,466
It's been fun.

881
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:35,189
Can I buy you a drink?

882
01:03:36,367 --> 01:03:38,298
I already have one.

883
01:03:44,199 --> 01:03:46,290
How about another?

884
01:03:47,866 --> 01:03:51,798
Yo! She'll have another.
I'm gonna have what she's having.

885
01:03:51,866 --> 01:03:54,889
I, uh--
I like your tight body.

886
01:03:54,966 --> 01:03:56,955
It looks like it would
do what I tell it.

887
01:03:57,032 --> 01:03:58,965
What?

888
01:03:59,033 --> 01:04:01,725
- I said--
- No, I heard what you said.

889
01:04:01,800 --> 01:04:05,891
And I'll admit that "What?" was a rather
banal, cliche, non-colorful response.

890
01:04:05,966 --> 01:04:10,227
What I really meant to say was,
"Why don't you do the world
a big, fat, fucking favor...

891
01:04:10,299 --> 01:04:12,458
and crawl back
into your mother's womb?"

892
01:04:12,533 --> 01:04:14,998
Some girls like men
to say things like that to them.

893
01:04:15,065 --> 01:04:17,725
Some girls like men
to take a dump on them.

894
01:04:17,800 --> 01:04:19,766
I'm not either one of those girls.

895
01:04:19,833 --> 01:04:21,890
I love your dirty little mouth.

896
01:04:21,965 --> 01:04:25,728
- This conversation is so over.
- What-- Hey, what's your problem?

897
01:04:25,799 --> 01:04:29,232
What's my problem?
Wow, that is fucking priceless!

898
01:04:29,299 --> 01:04:31,730
You cannot be for real.
Is there a hidden camera around here?

899
01:04:31,800 --> 01:04:33,891
Now, are you a natural redhead?

900
01:04:33,965 --> 01:04:36,056
If you even so much
as think of touching me...

901
01:04:36,132 --> 01:04:38,121
you're gonna find yourself
limping back to your mother's womb.

902
01:04:38,199 --> 01:04:40,665
- I'll take my chances.
- Yeah?

903
01:04:40,732 --> 01:04:43,255
Dude, you okay?

904
01:04:43,332 --> 01:04:45,388
Good one.

905
01:04:50,132 --> 01:04:52,495
Fuck!

906
01:04:52,566 --> 01:04:56,498
- This isn't how it looks.
- Most things aren't.

907
01:04:56,565 --> 01:04:58,464
- Right.
- Joan...

908
01:05:00,065 --> 01:05:02,724
I've been thinkin'.

909
01:05:02,799 --> 01:05:05,731
- And?
- A-And I feel--

910
01:05:07,065 --> 01:05:09,155
- I feel--
- You could have fooled me.

911
01:05:09,232 --> 01:05:13,288
I mean, that you feel.
That you feel anything.

912
01:05:13,365 --> 01:05:16,332
- Okay, now you're being mean.
- You know what, Keenan?

913
01:05:16,399 --> 01:05:19,489
- Pardon me for being an anger ball.
- "An anger ball"?

914
01:05:19,565 --> 01:05:21,793
But a lot has happened to me
in the last few days...

915
01:05:21,865 --> 01:05:24,490
on the emotional roller coaster
which I laughingly call my life.

916
01:05:24,565 --> 01:05:26,929
Hell, a lot's happened to me
in the last few minutes.

917
01:05:26,999 --> 01:05:29,089
So you know what?
Let's just call this the new me.

918
01:05:29,165 --> 01:05:31,723
There was nothing wrong
with the old you.

919
01:05:32,898 --> 01:05:35,330
Man--

920
01:05:35,398 --> 01:05:38,831
You can't treat people
like you treat people...

921
01:05:38,899 --> 01:05:42,661
and then say something
adorable like that.

922
01:05:44,232 --> 01:05:46,629
There's some things about me
you don't know.

923
01:05:46,698 --> 01:05:49,925
I don't know anything about you!

924
01:05:50,065 --> 01:05:53,155
Stop.
Who's going to pay for all of this?

925
01:05:53,231 --> 01:05:55,254
We don't need the depositions now.

926
01:05:55,331 --> 01:05:57,263
I don't do anything for nothing!

927
01:05:57,331 --> 01:06:00,559
- I'll pay him.
- Then I'll be forgiving.

928
01:06:00,632 --> 01:06:02,598
Good. We must go and give
your mother the good news.

929
01:06:02,665 --> 01:06:05,063
And I'll go count my money.

930
01:06:22,831 --> 01:06:25,889
- We're a hit.
- Yeah, well, let's see
what the critics have to say.

931
01:06:25,964 --> 01:06:28,021
Hey, who cares
what the critics have to say?

932
01:06:28,098 --> 01:06:30,030
- I do.
- I do.

933
01:06:30,098 --> 01:06:32,030
- Okay.
- I'm sure they'll love it.

934
01:06:35,498 --> 01:06:37,589
It was a good play.

935
01:06:37,664 --> 01:06:40,426
You mean before
I deconstructed it?

936
01:06:40,498 --> 01:06:42,589
Uh, before and after.

937
01:06:42,664 --> 01:06:45,630
I'd say it was the perfect blend
of Moliere and Meredith.

938
01:06:45,697 --> 01:06:48,254
I'm glad you came.

939
01:06:48,331 --> 01:06:52,127
-Last time we saw each other was a bit--
-Yeah, I know.

940
01:06:52,198 --> 01:06:54,356
It didn't quite go
as I had hoped.

941
01:06:54,431 --> 01:06:56,522
You don't have to apologize.

942
01:06:56,597 --> 01:06:58,688
I'm not...
apologizing.

943
01:06:58,764 --> 01:07:01,161
I didn't do anything wrong.

944
01:07:02,264 --> 01:07:05,026
- Oh, and I did, I suppose.
- Uh-huh.

945
01:07:05,098 --> 01:07:08,621
But I've decided
not to let you get away with it.

946
01:07:08,697 --> 01:07:11,185
So, I'm inviting you
to dinner...

947
01:07:11,265 --> 01:07:13,196
at my house.

948
01:07:13,264 --> 01:07:16,355
Tomorrow night, 8:00 sharp.

949
01:07:19,930 --> 01:07:21,863
Don't bring your dog.

950
01:07:26,231 --> 01:07:29,025
You really want
to kiss me, don't you?

951
01:07:29,097 --> 01:07:31,223
- Boy, do l.
- Tell me how much.

952
01:07:31,297 --> 01:07:34,128
- Tell me.
- What's on?

953
01:07:34,198 --> 01:07:36,129
Psycho's going on in ten minutes.

954
01:07:36,197 --> 01:07:39,288
If you're about to say,
"That's the one where the guy
dresses up in his mother's clothes...

955
01:07:39,364 --> 01:07:41,296
and kills people,"
don't bother.

956
01:07:41,364 --> 01:07:43,853
I've already seen this one.
Alone.

957
01:07:43,930 --> 01:07:48,022
I was just wondering when you were
planning on speaking to me again.

958
01:07:48,097 --> 01:07:50,688
I mean, about something
other than Psycho.

959
01:07:50,763 --> 01:07:54,059
It's almost been 24 hours
since we traded barbs.

960
01:07:54,131 --> 01:07:57,927
We don't want to get rusty, do we?

961
01:07:57,997 --> 01:08:02,623
I mean, just how much longer
do I have to wait...

962
01:08:02,696 --> 01:08:04,719
for my next dose of vitriol?

963
01:08:04,797 --> 01:08:06,730
How long have you got?

964
01:08:06,797 --> 01:08:11,059
A good question.

965
01:08:15,197 --> 01:08:17,719
Oh, damn.

966
01:08:17,797 --> 01:08:21,286
On the first date
my husband asked me:

967
01:08:21,364 --> 01:08:25,456
"Gracie... do you dream?"

968
01:08:26,696 --> 01:08:29,288
And I said, "Yes."

969
01:08:29,363 --> 01:08:34,524
From the time I get up in the morning
until I go to bed at night.

970
01:08:34,596 --> 01:08:38,051
You know how they say
the first time is never any good?

971
01:08:39,696 --> 01:08:42,958
Well, with us, it was wonderful.

972
01:08:46,863 --> 01:08:49,795
I never felt so awake.

973
01:08:51,530 --> 01:08:56,121
I had to reassure him that crying
was just my standard reaction...

974
01:08:56,197 --> 01:08:58,627
to tremendous pleasure.

975
01:09:01,363 --> 01:09:05,295
He held me, and he said
that he wanted to make me cry...

976
01:09:05,363 --> 01:09:08,624
for the rest of our lives.

977
01:09:09,862 --> 01:09:12,294
Flash forward 15 years...

978
01:09:12,363 --> 01:09:17,625
and somehow the two of us
became one... and one.

979
01:09:20,463 --> 01:09:24,293
And now I find myself living with
a roommate instead of a husband.

980
01:09:24,363 --> 01:09:26,454
And I have dogs instead of children...

981
01:09:26,529 --> 01:09:29,963
because I can have dogs,
but I can't have children.

982
01:09:30,029 --> 01:09:32,961
And--

983
01:09:33,029 --> 01:09:37,155
Oh, I've forgotten
who blames who for that.

984
01:09:41,196 --> 01:09:43,628
And I haven't cried
in a very long time.

985
01:09:54,129 --> 01:09:59,221
My breaking point
happened this afternoon...

986
01:09:59,295 --> 01:10:02,693
when I picked up my kids
from day care.

987
01:10:04,796 --> 01:10:06,728
With you...

988
01:10:06,796 --> 01:10:10,728
I was spontaneous for the first time
in my entire life.

989
01:10:12,129 --> 01:10:15,151
And I discovered
I'm not very good at spontaneity.

990
01:10:17,463 --> 01:10:21,394
Is there something that you can see
your husband doing...

991
01:10:21,462 --> 01:10:24,054
or saying that would
make a difference?

992
01:10:24,129 --> 01:10:27,720
Sometimes I think it could be as simple
as his asking me to go for a walk.

993
01:10:27,796 --> 01:10:29,728
Um...

994
01:10:31,629 --> 01:10:34,891
anything, so long as it felt
like a start.

995
01:10:34,962 --> 01:10:37,394
Maybe this was your start.

996
01:10:37,462 --> 01:10:40,519
You're a fucking optimist.

997
01:10:40,595 --> 01:10:43,322
That's my job.

998
01:10:54,728 --> 01:10:58,820
This doesn't change anything
about Saturday, does it?

999
01:10:58,895 --> 01:11:02,828
This doesn't change anything
about Saturday.

1000
01:11:05,128 --> 01:11:09,027
So, let me take a stab
at Keenan's story.

1001
01:11:10,228 --> 01:11:12,160
You had a great love.

1002
01:11:12,228 --> 01:11:14,160
The romance of your lifetime.

1003
01:11:14,228 --> 01:11:17,456
Totally cosmic, out-of-this-world bond
with little Miss X...

1004
01:11:18,562 --> 01:11:20,493
and she left you.

1005
01:11:20,561 --> 01:11:23,153
You're not far off.

1006
01:11:23,228 --> 01:11:25,353
People get over these things, Keenan.

1007
01:11:25,429 --> 01:11:28,088
Hell, I'm getting over these things...
all the time.

1008
01:11:28,162 --> 01:11:30,321
Well, it can only be once for me.

1009
01:11:30,395 --> 01:11:33,259
You're sweet to believe things
so absolutely...

1010
01:11:33,328 --> 01:11:35,816
but you're also full of shit.

1011
01:11:36,961 --> 01:11:38,893
You can love again.

1012
01:11:38,961 --> 01:11:42,893
I can't.
Any more than you--

1013
01:11:42,961 --> 01:11:45,483
- Any more than I can what?
- I don't know.

1014
01:11:45,561 --> 01:11:47,618
A-Any more than you
can stop drinking.

1015
01:11:55,994 --> 01:11:57,984
- Can I get you another one?
- No, I'm fine. Thanks.

1016
01:11:58,060 --> 01:12:01,288
- It was a gin martini, right?
- Vodka, but, really, I've had enough.

1017
01:12:01,361 --> 01:12:04,089
- I insist, please.
- Look, pal--

1018
01:12:04,161 --> 01:12:07,287
And I mean this affectionately,
all right? Scram.

1019
01:12:08,995 --> 01:12:11,756
Where were we?
Oh, yes, I've just given up alcohol...

1020
01:12:11,827 --> 01:12:14,293
and you're going to tell me
about the great love of your life.

1021
01:12:14,362 --> 01:12:18,088
- Her name was Sarah.
- And she was your first?

1022
01:12:18,162 --> 01:12:20,093
Yes.

1023
01:12:20,161 --> 01:12:23,924
Look... it's natural
to elevate our first love...

1024
01:12:23,995 --> 01:12:27,085
to some sort of
mythic emotional plateau.

1025
01:12:27,161 --> 01:12:29,593
But you fell in love, she left you...

1026
01:12:29,660 --> 01:12:31,923
and now you're dealing with
love's most common byproduct:

1027
01:12:31,995 --> 01:12:33,961
suicidal manic depression.

1028
01:12:34,028 --> 01:12:35,822
Right?

1029
01:12:35,894 --> 01:12:39,088
- Do you feel better?
- No.

1030
01:12:40,995 --> 01:12:44,256
It-- It's hard to talk about.

1031
01:12:44,327 --> 01:12:47,157
I have a friend,
a jazz musician, trumpet player.

1032
01:12:47,227 --> 01:12:50,250
Really terrific.
I go and hear him jam every month or so.

1033
01:12:50,327 --> 01:12:53,521
an old Chet Baker song.

1034
01:12:53,594 --> 01:12:57,321
And he blows the same notes every time,
but every time it sounds different.

1035
01:12:57,394 --> 01:13:01,689
And we had drinks one night--
when I used to drink--

1036
01:13:01,760 --> 01:13:03,692
and I tried to tell him
how that song made me feel...

1037
01:13:03,760 --> 01:13:07,522
how his playing made me feel,
how the music... made me feel.

1038
01:13:07,593 --> 01:13:10,685
And he just kept shaking
his head and he said...

1039
01:13:10,760 --> 01:13:12,693
"Joan, you can't talk about music.

1040
01:13:12,760 --> 01:13:16,022
Talking about music is like
dancing about architecture."

1041
01:13:16,927 --> 01:13:18,859
I said, "Well, okay, fine.

1042
01:13:18,927 --> 01:13:21,586
Gonna get all philosophical on me.
It's as pointless as talking
about a lot of things.

1043
01:13:21,660 --> 01:13:23,592
Love, for instance."

1044
01:13:23,660 --> 01:13:26,183
And my friend laughed,
and he said...

1045
01:13:26,260 --> 01:13:28,193
"Definitely. Most definitely.

1046
01:13:28,261 --> 01:13:31,455
Talking about love is like
dancing about architecture."

1047
01:13:31,527 --> 01:13:33,856
So, I don't know.
He might be right.

1048
01:13:35,261 --> 01:13:38,420
But it ain't gonna
stop me from trying.

1049
01:13:40,627 --> 01:13:44,559
I wish you'd do that
- smile.

1050
01:13:44,627 --> 01:13:47,184
So do l.

1051
01:13:50,260 --> 01:13:53,783
So let me guess. You and Wonder Woman
were together a year?

1052
01:13:53,860 --> 01:13:56,451
A year and a half.

1053
01:13:56,527 --> 01:13:58,550
And you were faithful to her?

1054
01:13:58,627 --> 01:14:00,888
Completely.

1055
01:14:00,960 --> 01:14:03,687
And you shared everything.

1056
01:14:09,827 --> 01:14:13,657
We-- We shared everything.

1057
01:14:15,026 --> 01:14:17,117
That must be nice.

1058
01:14:18,527 --> 01:14:21,118
It was...

1059
01:14:21,193 --> 01:14:23,125
but...

1060
01:14:25,026 --> 01:14:29,789
in addition to sharing
all of those things...

1061
01:14:29,859 --> 01:14:33,951
it turns out I was also sharing her...

1062
01:14:34,026 --> 01:14:36,651
with a variety of other people.

1063
01:14:38,027 --> 01:14:39,958
I hate to say this...

1064
01:14:40,026 --> 01:14:42,584
because l-l don't want
to diminish your feelings...

1065
01:14:42,660 --> 01:14:46,284
but, sadly, that happens every day.

1066
01:14:46,360 --> 01:14:48,882
Those other people shared needles.

1067
01:14:56,793 --> 01:15:00,384
She died last year.

1068
01:15:02,958 --> 01:15:07,050
But not before sharing...

1069
01:15:07,125 --> 01:15:10,683
one final thing with me.

1070
01:15:58,893 --> 01:16:01,949
Can I buy you a drink, Valery?

1071
01:16:02,025 --> 01:16:04,753
You seem to be so good at this.

1072
01:16:04,825 --> 01:16:07,986
Oh, I'm fine in scene class,
on stage.

1073
01:16:08,058 --> 01:16:11,990
It's just this improvisational--
I can't do it.

1074
01:16:12,058 --> 01:16:13,990
- Hmm.
- At least not like this.

1075
01:16:15,391 --> 01:16:18,449
Maybe I'm just better
at pretending I'm someone else.

1076
01:16:20,391 --> 01:16:24,324
Well, I gotta go. Um... I'll see you
in class tomorrow for the reports.

1077
01:16:24,392 --> 01:16:26,983
God knows what I'll say.

1078
01:16:27,058 --> 01:16:30,649
- I won't be there.
- Why?

1079
01:16:30,725 --> 01:16:34,782
I, uh-- I like this too much.

1080
01:16:34,858 --> 01:16:38,984
- I'm too good at it.
- I don't understand.

1081
01:16:39,058 --> 01:16:42,490
I'm better at all these lies
that I've manufactured...

1082
01:16:42,559 --> 01:16:45,150
than I am at the lies I'm living.

1083
01:16:48,558 --> 01:16:51,183
I have a wife.
Did you know that?

1084
01:16:53,792 --> 01:16:56,087
I don't think that
we like each other very much.

1085
01:16:58,191 --> 01:17:00,714
Is that something
to smile about?

1086
01:17:03,158 --> 01:17:06,250
Well, it's just that my wife--
She, um...

1087
01:17:06,325 --> 01:17:09,313
doesn't think that I have
much of an imagination.

1088
01:17:09,391 --> 01:17:11,618
If she only knew.

1089
01:17:13,158 --> 01:17:15,920
If she only knew a lot of things.

1090
01:17:15,992 --> 01:17:18,718
If I only knew a lot of things.

1091
01:17:18,792 --> 01:17:20,723
Such as?

1092
01:17:22,658 --> 01:17:24,590
Where to start:

1093
01:17:24,658 --> 01:17:27,920
with myself...

1094
01:17:27,992 --> 01:17:31,151
with my wife.

1095
01:17:43,924 --> 01:17:46,913
They got it back.

1096
01:17:46,991 --> 01:17:49,719
They got what back?

1097
01:17:49,791 --> 01:17:51,724
The police. Your car.

1098
01:17:51,791 --> 01:17:55,189
Oh, right. Yeah.

1099
01:17:55,258 --> 01:17:57,190
Keenan, listen, I'm--

1100
01:17:57,258 --> 01:18:00,520
You don't have to say anything. l-l told
you because I wanted to tell you.

1101
01:18:02,757 --> 01:18:06,349
I wanted to because for
the first time in a long time
I wish things were different.

1102
01:18:06,425 --> 01:18:09,118
- They can be.
- No, they can't.

1103
01:18:17,258 --> 01:18:19,450
Well, none of this means
you can't love.

1104
01:18:19,525 --> 01:18:22,854
Joan, it means exactly that.
It doesn't mean anything else.

1105
01:18:22,924 --> 01:18:25,390
I don't believe that for a second,
that you can't love.

1106
01:18:25,458 --> 01:18:27,515
- I can't.
- Stop saying that.

1107
01:18:27,590 --> 01:18:31,522
It's the only thing I can say
to make you understand.

1108
01:18:33,123 --> 01:18:37,181
This may sound corny, but--

1109
01:18:37,257 --> 01:18:40,690
But you don't want me.

1110
01:18:40,757 --> 01:18:42,723
I-I'm damaged goods.

1111
01:18:42,790 --> 01:18:47,849
For Christ's sake,
we're all damaged goods.

1112
01:18:47,924 --> 01:18:51,856
I'm wandering around through life
with hardly any purpose or goal at all.

1113
01:18:51,923 --> 01:18:54,355
I don't know what
I'm doing half the time...

1114
01:18:54,424 --> 01:18:56,686
but I know that I can love.

1115
01:18:56,757 --> 01:18:59,018
I know that I can love you.
I know that I do love you.

1116
01:18:59,091 --> 01:19:02,284
- I won't let you love me.
- Why?

1117
01:19:04,924 --> 01:19:08,014
I won't let you love me because...

1118
01:19:12,590 --> 01:19:15,021
because I love you.

1119
01:19:16,823 --> 01:19:19,187
You love me?

1120
01:19:19,257 --> 01:19:21,246
- Can I go?
- No!

1121
01:19:23,323 --> 01:19:25,686
Do you know how long I have waited
for somebody I care about...

1122
01:19:25,757 --> 01:19:28,154
to say that they love me
and for me to actually believe them?

1123
01:19:28,223 --> 01:19:30,348
And if you think you're getting out
of this car, you're insane!

1124
01:19:30,424 --> 01:19:32,515
It will never work.

1125
01:19:33,923 --> 01:19:35,855
It's already working.

1126
01:19:35,923 --> 01:19:39,014
It's working.

1127
01:19:45,256 --> 01:19:47,654
I thought--
I thought you didn't cry.

1128
01:19:47,723 --> 01:19:49,848
I thought you didn't date.

1129
01:19:49,923 --> 01:19:53,787
Surprise, I'm crying...

1130
01:19:53,856 --> 01:19:55,947
and this is very much a date.

1131
01:19:56,023 --> 01:20:00,455
It's unconventional, perhaps,
but it's the best date I've ever had.

1132
01:20:09,356 --> 01:20:12,288
I can't!

1133
01:20:12,357 --> 01:20:16,448
No-- Keenan, please!
Please don't go!

1134
01:20:35,523 --> 01:20:37,455
Hey!

1135
01:20:37,523 --> 01:20:41,115
Hi, buddies.
How are you?

1136
01:20:41,189 --> 01:20:43,280
Who's a good boy?
Who's a good boy?

1137
01:20:50,189 --> 01:20:52,553
You're home early tonight.

1138
01:20:53,789 --> 01:20:56,051
You as well.

1139
01:20:56,123 --> 01:20:58,781
Well, inventory's almost over.

1140
01:20:58,855 --> 01:21:01,878
How is your improv class?

1141
01:21:01,956 --> 01:21:04,615
It finished tonight.

1142
01:21:04,688 --> 01:21:07,553
I thought you had
another couple days.

1143
01:21:07,622 --> 01:21:13,419
Well, I should say that
I finished tonight.

1144
01:21:13,488 --> 01:21:15,648
It wasn't what you had in mind?

1145
01:21:15,723 --> 01:21:17,654
Ultimately, no.

1146
01:21:17,722 --> 01:21:23,212
Well... I'm sure you'll find
something you enjoy.

1147
01:21:26,789 --> 01:21:28,721
I mean, to keep you occupied.

1148
01:21:30,155 --> 01:21:32,713
I'm going to try.

1149
01:21:42,622 --> 01:21:45,214
Well, as the British say,
I'm knackered.

1150
01:21:47,455 --> 01:21:50,320
You know what Saturday is, don't you?

1151
01:21:50,388 --> 01:21:52,321
I do.

1152
01:21:52,389 --> 01:21:54,820
Okay.

1153
01:21:54,889 --> 01:21:57,321
It might be easier if we meet there.

1154
01:21:57,388 --> 01:21:59,980
Whatever's easier.

1155
01:22:00,054 --> 01:22:03,817
All right. Did you feed the dogs?
You gave them their pills?

1156
01:22:03,888 --> 01:22:07,650
Okay. Well, don't forget to turn out
the light before you come to bed.

1157
01:22:07,722 --> 01:22:10,483
- I won't.
- Tomorrow's trash day.

1158
01:22:17,388 --> 01:22:21,717
There isn't much more
we can do, except ease the pain.

1159
01:22:22,822 --> 01:22:25,310
All right.

1160
01:22:25,388 --> 01:22:27,649
Ease the pain.

1161
01:22:41,387 --> 01:22:43,650
- Mom?
- Yes, honey.

1162
01:22:43,721 --> 01:22:45,711
- Mom?
- I'm here.

1163
01:22:45,788 --> 01:22:48,481
Wh-Where's Jack?

1164
01:22:48,555 --> 01:22:52,146
- He's not here.
- He was just here a minute ago.

1165
01:22:52,220 --> 01:22:55,119
- No?
- No.

1166
01:22:55,188 --> 01:22:59,416
- It was... you who were here.
- Yes, I'm here.

1167
01:22:59,488 --> 01:23:03,977
- You are here, aren't you?
- Yes, I'm here.

1168
01:23:06,488 --> 01:23:08,749
Tell me about death.

1169
01:23:25,654 --> 01:23:28,586
Remember a long time ago...

1170
01:23:28,654 --> 01:23:31,143
when you were still
inside my belly...

1171
01:23:31,220 --> 01:23:34,914
and the contractions began?

1172
01:23:36,988 --> 01:23:40,317
Well, they're beginning again.

1173
01:23:40,387 --> 01:23:44,251
- Read me that story.
- What story?

1174
01:23:44,321 --> 01:23:47,253
The one with the rabbit
and the rocking chair.

1175
01:23:50,654 --> 01:23:52,813
- Good Night, Moon?
- Yeah.

1176
01:23:52,887 --> 01:23:56,342
I like the ending.
Read me the ending.

1177
01:24:13,587 --> 01:24:17,178
Good night, comb.

1178
01:24:17,254 --> 01:24:20,481
Good night, brush.

1179
01:24:20,554 --> 01:24:23,020
Good night, nobody.

1180
01:24:25,587 --> 01:24:28,519
Good night, mush.

1181
01:24:31,421 --> 01:24:36,353
Good night to the old lady
whispering hush.

1182
01:24:38,420 --> 01:24:40,352
Good night, stars.

1183
01:24:42,087 --> 01:24:46,678
Good night... air.

1184
01:24:49,920 --> 01:24:53,283
Good night, noises...

1185
01:24:56,520 --> 01:24:58,453
everywhere.

1186
01:25:51,353 --> 01:25:56,217
Do you ever wonder if
while we spend all this time
anthropomorphizing our animals...

1187
01:25:56,285 --> 01:25:58,717
maybe they're just
anthropomorphizing us?

1188
01:25:58,787 --> 01:26:00,809
Hmm.

1189
01:26:00,887 --> 01:26:04,375
I didn't think so.
Who? Keenan?

1190
01:26:04,453 --> 01:26:08,215
No. Trust me,
I'll never hear from him again.

1191
01:26:08,285 --> 01:26:12,877
Well, I'm sorry to disappoint you,
but I'm fresh out of jokes.

1192
01:26:12,953 --> 01:26:16,385
What, is that a rhetorical question?
Why is my life so complicated?

1193
01:26:16,453 --> 01:26:20,215
Gee, I don't know.
Why is your life so fucking simple?

1194
01:26:20,286 --> 01:26:22,877
Hold on. There's someone at the door.

1195
01:26:22,952 --> 01:26:25,611
Well, I don't know until I answer it,
do l? Yeah, I'll ask who it is.

1196
01:26:25,685 --> 01:26:27,618
Hold on.
Yeah.

1197
01:26:31,886 --> 01:26:33,545
Hi.

1198
01:26:33,619 --> 01:26:35,710
Hi.

1199
01:26:35,786 --> 01:26:39,115
Um, I'm just on the phone.
I'm gonna wrap it up, okay?

1200
01:26:49,352 --> 01:26:51,285
M.C.I.

1201
01:26:51,353 --> 01:26:53,614
They're geniuses at tricking you
into conversation.

1202
01:26:53,685 --> 01:26:56,412
I can't stop thinking about you.

1203
01:26:56,485 --> 01:26:58,314
I love conversations that
start with the guy saying...

1204
01:26:58,386 --> 01:27:00,248
"l can't stop thinking about you."

1205
01:27:00,318 --> 01:27:02,944
Mind you, I've never actually
been on the receiving end
of any of those conversations.

1206
01:27:03,019 --> 01:27:04,950
Just looking at you
makes me happy.

1207
01:27:05,019 --> 01:27:07,144
I have--
I have to sit down.

1208
01:27:10,119 --> 01:27:14,483
When we're together,
whether or not I show it...

1209
01:27:14,551 --> 01:27:19,041
I just can't wait to hear
the next words out of your mouth.

1210
01:27:19,118 --> 01:27:23,244
But right now I need to ask you
to do something for me.

1211
01:27:23,318 --> 01:27:25,250
Anything.

1212
01:27:25,318 --> 01:27:28,977
Shut up.
Just for a moment.

1213
01:27:29,051 --> 01:27:31,779
I've been-- I've been thinking about
what you said last night.

1214
01:27:33,385 --> 01:27:37,147
I have no idea
why you're so relentless...

1215
01:27:37,218 --> 01:27:39,809
particularly, given the arsenal
of defenses I've thrown at you.

1216
01:27:39,885 --> 01:27:41,817
But...

1217
01:27:43,551 --> 01:27:49,450
no matter how hard I've tried to block
out everything that you've said...

1218
01:27:49,518 --> 01:27:51,541
the message has been received.

1219
01:27:54,985 --> 01:27:58,246
In a place inside me
that I thought had died.

1220
01:27:59,318 --> 01:28:02,045
But it hasn't.

1221
01:28:03,818 --> 01:28:07,580
And that place inside me
is alive and well.

1222
01:28:11,151 --> 01:28:13,242
I can't make any promises...

1223
01:28:13,318 --> 01:28:15,749
but...

1224
01:28:15,818 --> 01:28:18,579
I'd like to try and be with you.

1225
01:28:21,218 --> 01:28:25,240
It won't be easy,
but I'd like to try.

1226
01:28:25,317 --> 01:28:27,545
Can I say something?

1227
01:28:35,717 --> 01:28:39,411
You're right.
It won't be easy, but...

1228
01:28:42,484 --> 01:28:44,677
that's okay.

1229
01:28:46,151 --> 01:28:50,311
I want to be with you, but,
you have to understand, l, um--

1230
01:28:50,384 --> 01:28:52,407
- We can't--
- Have sex.

1231
01:28:52,484 --> 01:28:55,917
It may not be the conventional wisdom,
but it's the only way I can do this.

1232
01:28:55,984 --> 01:28:58,109
At least for the time being.

1233
01:28:59,483 --> 01:29:01,450
That's not a problem?

1234
01:29:01,517 --> 01:29:07,075
When was having sex
or not having sex not a problem?

1235
01:29:07,151 --> 01:29:11,913
To be honest, it's gonna
be difficult not to express
physically what I feel for you...

1236
01:29:11,984 --> 01:29:16,383
but...
we can look for other ways.

1237
01:29:16,451 --> 01:29:21,542
There's nothing wrong
with holding each other. Hmm?

1238
01:29:21,618 --> 01:29:24,106
Nothing at all.

1239
01:29:24,184 --> 01:29:26,116
And sleeping with each other.

1240
01:29:26,184 --> 01:29:28,116
We can do that.

1241
01:29:28,183 --> 01:29:30,945
And... loving each other forever.

1242
01:29:32,484 --> 01:29:35,574
What did I ever do to deserve you?

1243
01:29:35,650 --> 01:29:39,912
Usually that line is screamed at me
by somebody running out the door...

1244
01:29:39,984 --> 01:29:43,746
not standing in front
of me and staying.

1245
01:29:43,817 --> 01:29:46,579
It makes for a nice change.

1246
01:30:07,683 --> 01:30:09,615
Ah, flowers.

1247
01:30:09,683 --> 01:30:12,513
How thoughtful.

1248
01:30:12,583 --> 01:30:15,673
Whoo. We like the same merlot.

1249
01:30:15,750 --> 01:30:18,682
It's actually the very same bottle
that you brought to my house.

1250
01:30:18,750 --> 01:30:21,238
Excellent.

1251
01:30:21,316 --> 01:30:23,339
Come on in.

1252
01:30:23,417 --> 01:30:25,349
Wow.

1253
01:30:30,583 --> 01:30:34,174
- You're wondering where dinner is.
- Uh, I must say.

1254
01:30:34,250 --> 01:30:36,511
I have a little confession to make.

1255
01:30:36,583 --> 01:30:39,844
I invited you to dinner at my house,
but I can't cook.

1256
01:30:39,917 --> 01:30:42,008
Oh.

1257
01:30:42,083 --> 01:30:44,016
I can order delivery.

1258
01:30:44,084 --> 01:30:46,174
All right.

1259
01:30:46,250 --> 01:30:48,511
Chinese food is my specialty.

1260
01:30:58,183 --> 01:31:00,614
What are we making?

1261
01:31:00,683 --> 01:31:02,774
Some hemlock.

1262
01:31:02,849 --> 01:31:05,372
Oh, please, don't deprive
the kids of their mother.

1263
01:31:05,450 --> 01:31:09,779
- Oh, I'm not making it for me.
- Ah, that's the Hannah that I know.

1264
01:31:09,850 --> 01:31:13,713
Well, you seem to know me
a lot better than I know you.

1265
01:31:13,783 --> 01:31:16,113
You know that's not true.

1266
01:31:16,183 --> 01:31:21,479
Do you remember what you told
the kids about falling in love?

1267
01:31:22,849 --> 01:31:25,281
- No.
- Well, I do.

1268
01:31:25,350 --> 01:31:28,782
You said that the wonderful thing
about falling in love...

1269
01:31:28,849 --> 01:31:34,611
is that you learn everything
about that person, and so quickly.

1270
01:31:34,682 --> 01:31:36,614
And if it's true love...

1271
01:31:36,682 --> 01:31:40,114
then you start to see yourself
through their eyes...

1272
01:31:40,182 --> 01:31:42,115
and it brings out
the best in you...

1273
01:31:42,182 --> 01:31:46,615
and it's almost as if you're
falling in love with yourself.

1274
01:31:46,682 --> 01:31:49,944
- I said that?
- Mm-hmm.

1275
01:31:50,016 --> 01:31:54,311
Well, 25 years ago,
I needed to feel that again.

1276
01:31:54,383 --> 01:31:57,712
Feel that I was worth loving.

1277
01:31:57,783 --> 01:32:00,215
Because somehow I knew...

1278
01:32:00,283 --> 01:32:04,612
that would be my last time
to have that particular feeling.

1279
01:32:06,449 --> 01:32:10,040
- You couldn't have it with me?
- Oh, I did have it with you...

1280
01:32:10,115 --> 01:32:12,206
but I'd forgotten it.

1281
01:32:12,282 --> 01:32:15,043
I hadn't forgotten
why I loved you...

1282
01:32:15,115 --> 01:32:17,945
but I'd forgotten
why you loved me.

1283
01:32:21,949 --> 01:32:24,709
And Wendy made me remember...

1284
01:32:24,783 --> 01:32:28,374
that I was a pretty terrific fellow.

1285
01:32:28,448 --> 01:32:30,880
Bully for Wendy.

1286
01:32:30,948 --> 01:32:34,880
But I knew that
I couldn't sleep with her.

1287
01:32:34,948 --> 01:32:36,574
Why?

1288
01:32:36,648 --> 01:32:40,808
Because I would have left you...
and the kids.

1289
01:32:51,449 --> 01:32:54,312
What are we thinking?

1290
01:32:54,382 --> 01:32:56,973
Hot liquid and facial burns.

1291
01:32:57,048 --> 01:32:59,309
Oh.

1292
01:32:59,382 --> 01:33:04,474
Remember the day
Wendy left the company...

1293
01:33:04,548 --> 01:33:07,480
- and went to Seattle?
- Yes.

1294
01:33:07,548 --> 01:33:09,639
I thought for a while
you might go with her.

1295
01:33:09,715 --> 01:33:12,647
Me too, but I didn't.

1296
01:33:16,381 --> 01:33:18,973
When I came home that day...

1297
01:33:19,048 --> 01:33:23,140
I realized that I was
more in love with you...

1298
01:33:23,215 --> 01:33:25,476
than ever before.

1299
01:33:27,214 --> 01:33:30,647
How did that thunderbolt strike you?

1300
01:33:30,715 --> 01:33:33,805
Because I'd made a choice.

1301
01:33:35,047 --> 01:33:38,481
I took one look at you...

1302
01:33:38,548 --> 01:33:43,140
and I knew I'd made
the right choice.

1303
01:33:43,214 --> 01:33:45,476
I know that sounds daft...

1304
01:33:45,547 --> 01:33:49,311
but my love for somebody else...

1305
01:33:49,381 --> 01:33:52,246
made me love you more...

1306
01:33:52,314 --> 01:33:56,576
because I sought...

1307
01:33:56,648 --> 01:33:58,580
to reclaim myself.

1308
01:34:00,314 --> 01:34:02,575
And, Hannah...

1309
01:34:02,648 --> 01:34:05,580
you're still the right choice.

1310
01:34:08,648 --> 01:34:11,580
We made a child that day.

1311
01:34:11,647 --> 01:34:13,580
We did, indeed.

1312
01:34:13,648 --> 01:34:16,239
Our Jo-Jo.

1313
01:34:16,313 --> 01:34:19,905
Yeah. We did, indeed.

1314
01:34:35,314 --> 01:34:37,905
- Cheers.
- Thank you.

1315
01:34:40,647 --> 01:34:43,579
Trent...

1316
01:34:43,647 --> 01:34:45,704
I have to tell you something.

1317
01:34:45,781 --> 01:34:49,235
Oh, this doesn't begin with
"Trent, you are a nice guy," does it?

1318
01:34:49,314 --> 01:34:51,609
- No.
- Whew.

1319
01:34:51,680 --> 01:34:55,339
The problem I have with you--

1320
01:34:56,746 --> 01:34:59,009
We have problems?

1321
01:35:02,913 --> 01:35:06,676
The problem I have with you...

1322
01:35:06,746 --> 01:35:09,508
is that I'm attracted to you.

1323
01:35:11,580 --> 01:35:13,546
And that's a problem?

1324
01:35:15,614 --> 01:35:18,738
It is for me.

1325
01:35:18,813 --> 01:35:22,007
It's, um--

1326
01:35:23,247 --> 01:35:25,338
Gosh, this is so embarrassing.

1327
01:35:25,414 --> 01:35:27,346
What?

1328
01:35:27,414 --> 01:35:30,005
Don't be embarrassed.

1329
01:35:33,746 --> 01:35:36,838
I don't deal with passion well.

1330
01:35:36,913 --> 01:35:40,004
Maybe you don't like
that loss of control.

1331
01:35:40,081 --> 01:35:44,172
You prefer to be the director,
telling everyone what to do.

1332
01:35:45,746 --> 01:35:48,337
It's pretty painfully obvious,
isn't it?

1333
01:35:48,414 --> 01:35:51,607
Somewhat painful, yes.

1334
01:35:54,180 --> 01:35:57,441
You know, there's something
you'll find out about me.

1335
01:35:57,513 --> 01:35:59,945
What's that?

1336
01:36:03,679 --> 01:36:06,441
That I take direction pretty well.

1337
01:36:31,846 --> 01:36:33,778
- Trent.
- Yeah?

1338
01:36:33,846 --> 01:36:36,437
You're gonna think what I'm about
to say is really ridiculous.

1339
01:36:36,513 --> 01:36:39,275
You're worried about Barley,
and you want to go back to your place.

1340
01:36:39,346 --> 01:36:43,278
Oh, my God.
This is way fucking spooky.

1341
01:36:56,280 --> 01:36:59,212
I forgot what it felt like
to be this close to someone.

1342
01:36:59,279 --> 01:37:03,711
I have never been
this close to anyone.

1343
01:37:11,112 --> 01:37:14,374
We're always gonna be honest
with each other, right?

1344
01:37:14,446 --> 01:37:16,877
It's essential.

1345
01:37:16,945 --> 01:37:21,877
Um... I have
to confess something.

1346
01:37:23,079 --> 01:37:25,012
Shoot.

1347
01:37:27,112 --> 01:37:31,806
Um... the night we went to the movies,
and you walked me to my car--

1348
01:37:31,879 --> 01:37:34,209
You mean the car
that you pretended was stolen?

1349
01:37:34,279 --> 01:37:37,609
You knew?

1350
01:37:37,678 --> 01:37:39,974
Joan--

1351
01:37:43,612 --> 01:37:46,044
I may have been
a basket case that evening...

1352
01:37:46,112 --> 01:37:48,703
but I wasn't born yesterday.

1353
01:37:48,780 --> 01:37:50,870
I am so embarrassed.

1354
01:37:52,378 --> 01:37:55,640
No. No.

1355
01:37:58,211 --> 01:38:01,905
Oh-- Oh, well.

1356
01:38:05,879 --> 01:38:07,936
I so very much love you.

1357
01:38:08,012 --> 01:38:10,637
And I love you.

1358
01:38:12,545 --> 01:38:14,477
And, Joan?

1359
01:38:14,546 --> 01:38:16,477
Yes, Keenan.

1360
01:38:16,545 --> 01:38:21,170
In time... I may even get
to like this mangy cat of ours.

1361
01:38:23,545 --> 01:38:26,773
She's got her eye on you.

1362
01:38:28,677 --> 01:38:30,644
And that's her good one?

1363
01:38:54,545 --> 01:38:56,636
I think this is gonna work.

1364
01:38:56,712 --> 01:38:58,643
Yeah?
Why is that?

1365
01:38:58,712 --> 01:39:01,143
- Because on an intimacy scale...
- Mm-hmm.

1366
01:39:01,211 --> 01:39:03,302
having somebody watch me
brush my teeth...

1367
01:39:03,378 --> 01:39:05,969
is right up there with seeing me
on a Sazerac swing...

1368
01:39:06,044 --> 01:39:08,135
and I'm not minding it.

1369
01:39:20,044 --> 01:39:22,942
Hmm?

1370
01:39:27,545 --> 01:39:30,477
This had better be good.

1371
01:39:30,544 --> 01:39:32,477
Oh--

1372
01:39:39,377 --> 01:39:43,310
Uh... I'll catch
the first flight out.

1373
01:40:08,310 --> 01:40:10,242
Mildred.

1374
01:40:29,310 --> 01:40:33,571
You don't know what it means to me,
for you to be here.

1375
01:40:38,310 --> 01:40:40,742
He was my first love.

1376
01:40:43,010 --> 01:40:44,943
And my last.

1377
01:40:45,010 --> 01:40:48,704
Next to Jack.

1378
01:40:48,777 --> 01:40:50,744
Did you know him?
Jack?

1379
01:40:53,743 --> 01:40:55,767
He was good for Mark.

1380
01:40:55,843 --> 01:41:00,173
Well, I would have liked
to have known him.

1381
01:41:02,743 --> 01:41:06,176
I guess you all thought
I couldn't handle it.

1382
01:41:09,877 --> 01:41:12,843
Until just a week ago...

1383
01:41:12,910 --> 01:41:16,933
I still harbored the fantasy that
you and he would get together again.

1384
01:41:20,476 --> 01:41:23,670
We had some nice talks
before he died.

1385
01:41:24,910 --> 01:41:27,467
I'm glad we had those talks.

1386
01:41:27,543 --> 01:41:32,168
I felt like his mother again.

1387
01:41:42,410 --> 01:41:45,672
I'll never know
everything about Mark...

1388
01:41:47,576 --> 01:41:51,030
but I know some things about him now
that I never knew before.

1389
01:41:51,110 --> 01:41:55,939
I don't think we need to know everything
about the people we love.

1390
01:42:08,710 --> 01:42:12,039
Yeah. Hello?

1391
01:42:12,109 --> 01:42:14,268
- Trent?
- Hey.

1392
01:42:14,342 --> 01:42:16,275
How are you?

1393
01:42:16,343 --> 01:42:18,275
I'm good.

1394
01:42:18,343 --> 01:42:20,775
I was, uh-- I was just calling in
for my messages.

1395
01:42:20,842 --> 01:42:22,775
What are you doing there?

1396
01:42:22,842 --> 01:42:25,104
Oh, l, uh--

1397
01:42:25,176 --> 01:42:27,266
I took Barley over to my house...

1398
01:42:27,343 --> 01:42:30,104
and I don't think he liked it.

1399
01:42:30,175 --> 01:42:32,869
Actually, I'm sure he didn't like it.
He peed all over my stuff.

1400
01:42:32,942 --> 01:42:37,271
So... I came back here.

1401
01:42:37,343 --> 01:42:39,604
I'm glad.

1402
01:42:40,676 --> 01:42:42,937
How was everything where you are?

1403
01:42:43,009 --> 01:42:46,600
In its own way,
it was quite beautiful.

1404
01:42:48,176 --> 01:42:51,199
- Trent?
- Yeah?

1405
01:42:53,442 --> 01:42:55,908
Is it too late to say,
"l love you"?

1406
01:42:55,975 --> 01:42:57,965
It's early.

1407
01:43:06,443 --> 01:43:08,374
She's coming back tomorrow.

1408
01:43:12,609 --> 01:43:17,338
And then sleeping arrangements
will definitely be revised.

1409
01:43:30,941 --> 01:43:32,930
Come over later.

1410
01:43:34,108 --> 01:43:36,870
I don't--
I don't know if I'm up to it.

1411
01:43:36,942 --> 01:43:38,931
Well, think about it, Mildred.

1412
01:43:39,009 --> 01:43:41,270
I'd love to have you there.

1413
01:43:41,342 --> 01:43:43,274
I'll think about it.

1414
01:44:21,608 --> 01:44:23,541
Mom?

1415
01:44:27,041 --> 01:44:30,370
- Mom?
- Yes, out here, Meredith.

1416
01:44:31,541 --> 01:44:33,632
Make three--

1417
01:44:33,708 --> 01:44:36,299
Three times as many seems reasonable.

1418
01:44:36,375 --> 01:44:39,135
- Hello, sweetheart.
- Hi. Hi.

1419
01:44:39,207 --> 01:44:43,231
That sister of yours was
supposed to be here an hour ago
to help me with all this.

1420
01:44:43,307 --> 01:44:47,297
And here she is,
looking fabulous I might add.

1421
01:44:47,374 --> 01:44:50,136
I'm so sorry I'm late.
What can I do?

1422
01:44:50,208 --> 01:44:54,401
You can put on a bra,
and then you can do everything else.

1423
01:44:54,474 --> 01:44:56,407
Oh, it's not like
you were any help.

1424
01:44:56,474 --> 01:44:58,406
- Why, you know my play was opening.
- I know.

1425
01:44:58,474 --> 01:45:01,907
That's right. Your father has the review
on the refrigerator already.

1426
01:45:01,975 --> 01:45:04,566
Mr. Crabby from the Times
gave it a rave. Congrats.

1427
01:45:04,640 --> 01:45:07,572
- You mean you read it?
- I'm proud of my younger sister.

1428
01:45:07,641 --> 01:45:11,403
Now to work. Believe it or not,
I have worn these fingers to a frazzle.

1429
01:45:11,474 --> 01:45:14,736
Speed dialing is so strenuous.
I've taken care of the caterers...

1430
01:45:14,808 --> 01:45:18,240
the flowers are being arranged
as we speak, and I've hired a minister.

1431
01:45:18,307 --> 01:45:21,704
You did tell him to go easy
on the God stuff, hmm?

1432
01:45:21,775 --> 01:45:23,740
Yes, Daddy.

1433
01:45:23,807 --> 01:45:26,399
Gracie, Gracie, Gracie.

1434
01:45:26,474 --> 01:45:29,065
The other bearded one
will barely get a mention.

1435
01:45:29,141 --> 01:45:31,073
All right.

1436
01:45:31,141 --> 01:45:33,402
Ah, my Meredith.

1437
01:45:36,341 --> 01:45:38,204
You know, we do have to change.

1438
01:45:38,274 --> 01:45:41,569
Well, if I have to wear a tux,
she has to wear a bra.

1439
01:45:41,640 --> 01:45:43,607
Inside.

1440
01:45:43,673 --> 01:45:46,196
- I never knew what happiness was
until I married your mother...
- Just march.

1441
01:45:46,273 --> 01:45:48,399
and by then it was too late.

1442
01:45:48,474 --> 01:45:50,405
You are so--

1443
01:45:50,473 --> 01:45:53,735
Now, listen. I put you in a seat
next to Hugh and me because I figured...

1444
01:45:53,807 --> 01:45:55,739
you might be coming alone and--

1445
01:45:55,807 --> 01:45:59,331
Yeah, well, you might have to do
some rearranging because, um...

1446
01:45:59,408 --> 01:46:02,134
because I have a date.

1447
01:46:02,207 --> 01:46:04,036
We'll change fast.

1448
01:46:04,107 --> 01:46:07,402
You know
you're gonna tell me every single thing.

1449
01:46:12,673 --> 01:46:14,605
Mom, Dad...

1450
01:46:14,674 --> 01:46:16,435
this is Trent.

1451
01:46:16,507 --> 01:46:18,440
- Hi.
- It's a pleasure, Trent.

1452
01:46:18,507 --> 01:46:20,439
- It's a pleasure to meet you.
Congratulations.
- Hello.

1453
01:46:20,508 --> 01:46:23,667
- Thank you.
- Hi. I'm the older married sister.

1454
01:46:23,740 --> 01:46:26,729
- Hi.
- Sorry. Gracie.

1455
01:46:26,807 --> 01:46:28,636
I see what you mean.
Okay, we better get started.

1456
01:46:28,707 --> 01:46:32,140
- We're 20 minutes behind
and the minister has another service.
- We can't go without Jo-Jo.

1457
01:46:32,207 --> 01:46:35,229
- Moi.
- Oh! Now we can.

1458
01:46:35,306 --> 01:46:37,239
- Hi, sweetheart.
- Mom, you look beautiful.

1459
01:46:37,306 --> 01:46:39,829
- Thank you.
You're forgiven for being late.
- Thank you.

1460
01:46:39,906 --> 01:46:42,668
Dad, wow.

1461
01:46:42,740 --> 01:46:45,501
Forty years ago,
he wore jeans to our wedding.

1462
01:46:45,573 --> 01:46:47,505
You should have heard the fuss
he made this time...

1463
01:46:47,573 --> 01:46:49,505
when he found out
he had to wear a tux.

1464
01:46:49,572 --> 01:46:51,936
What an anger ball.

1465
01:46:52,006 --> 01:46:54,029
Oh, Mom, Dad, everybody...

1466
01:46:54,106 --> 01:46:56,800
- this is Keenan.
- How do you do, Keenan?

1467
01:46:56,874 --> 01:46:59,806
- Very good, sir.
- Good to meet you, Keenan.

1468
01:46:59,873 --> 01:47:02,931
- Nice to meet you.
- Champagne. Jo-Jo?

1469
01:47:03,007 --> 01:47:06,097
- Um... I'm okay.
- Oh.

1470
01:47:06,173 --> 01:47:09,105
Keenan and I are just gonna
have a couple Cokes or something.

1471
01:47:09,173 --> 01:47:13,435
Keenan, did I tell you
how very good it is to meet you?

1472
01:47:13,507 --> 01:47:16,268
Funny.

1473
01:47:21,670 --> 01:47:24,157
Hannah and Paul have asked
their family and friends...

1474
01:47:24,237 --> 01:47:27,669
to join them here today
in their home...

1475
01:47:27,736 --> 01:47:29,929
to reaffirm their wedding vows...

1476
01:47:30,004 --> 01:47:32,730
40 years since the first time.

1477
01:47:36,136 --> 01:47:38,159
What's this?
No applause?

1478
01:47:38,236 --> 01:47:42,931
Don't they realize what a miracle
40 years of marriage is?

1479
01:47:43,003 --> 01:47:46,196
Probably not, but I do.

1480
01:47:49,337 --> 01:47:51,564
Hannah and Paul,
you come here today...

1481
01:47:51,636 --> 01:47:55,069
to repledge your love,
your undying love.

1482
01:47:55,136 --> 01:47:57,567
A love that has lasted many years...

1483
01:47:57,636 --> 01:48:02,228
and will go on lasting, I'm certain,
many years more.

1484
01:48:02,302 --> 01:48:05,064
You stand here today
before God...

1485
01:48:05,136 --> 01:48:08,260
your family and friends
to celebrate...

1486
01:48:08,337 --> 01:48:11,359
to reaffirm your lasting love
for each other.

1487
01:48:11,436 --> 01:48:15,198
Hannah and Paul have asked
to keep the ceremony simple...

1488
01:48:15,269 --> 01:48:18,497
and to that end they each set
a challenge for the other:

1489
01:48:18,569 --> 01:48:23,025
to find a sentence that best describes
their feelings for the other.

1490
01:48:23,102 --> 01:48:25,761
Hannah? Paul?

1491
01:48:29,603 --> 01:48:32,967
You are the tenant of my heart...

1492
01:48:33,035 --> 01:48:36,433
often behind in the rent...

1493
01:48:36,502 --> 01:48:39,764
but impossible to evict.

1494
01:48:39,835 --> 01:48:42,858
If I had to do it all over again...

1495
01:48:42,936 --> 01:48:47,731
I wouldn't do it...
any different.

1496
01:49:30,668 --> 01:49:33,429
Mildred, I'm so sorry.

1497
01:49:45,168 --> 01:49:48,294
- So, that's who I stole
your V.W. for, huh?
- Yeah.

1498
01:49:48,368 --> 01:49:51,562
Thank you.

1499
01:49:54,235 --> 01:49:57,690
- And you thought
it wasn't gonna work out.
- Yeah.

1500
01:50:02,102 --> 01:50:04,499
That was really...
beautiful.

1501
01:50:05,902 --> 01:50:07,834
It was.

1502
01:50:09,368 --> 01:50:11,300
Yes, it was.

1503
01:50:16,001 --> 01:50:20,127
Think we'll be having
a fortieth wedding ceremony?

1504
01:50:24,069 --> 01:50:26,694
I don't know, Hugh.

1505
01:50:44,035 --> 01:50:45,966
Would you like to think so?

1506
01:50:48,567 --> 01:50:50,624
I don't know, Hugh.

1507
01:50:53,368 --> 01:50:55,526
- Hey.
- Hello.

01:50:55,601 --> 01:50:58,033
Hi.

1509
01:50:58,101 --> 01:51:01,965
- How did you like that improv class?
- That was... interesting.

1510
01:51:02,034 --> 01:51:04,795
I think it's so cool to pretend to be
somebody else every night for a week.

1511
01:51:04,868 --> 01:51:06,800
I took it twice.

1512
01:51:08,235 --> 01:51:10,166
This is Keenan, by the way.

1513
01:51:10,234 --> 01:51:12,860
Hi. Hugh.
I'm, uh, married to Gracie here.

1514
01:51:12,934 --> 01:51:14,627
Hugh designs video games.

1515
01:51:14,701 --> 01:51:19,191
- Any I'd know?
- Um, "Killer Golf." That was the last.

1516
01:51:19,267 --> 01:51:21,131
Oh, man, that game was awesome.

1517
01:51:21,201 --> 01:51:23,894
You have a hell of an imagination.

1518
01:51:23,967 --> 01:51:26,593
Hey, you owe me a dance.

1519
01:51:26,667 --> 01:51:29,156
- Just one?
- No.

1520
01:51:38,566 --> 01:51:40,499
Gracie...

1521
01:51:42,467 --> 01:51:44,399
would you like to dance?

1522
01:51:44,467 --> 01:51:48,365
Yes. Yes, I would.

1523
01:51:55,600 --> 01:51:59,726
You know, I can't think
of a better way to meet your family.

1524
01:51:59,800 --> 01:52:02,358
Other than maybe dropping a bookshelf
on their heads.

1525
01:52:07,299 --> 01:52:09,459
They look so perfect together.

1526
01:52:11,534 --> 01:52:14,056
They look so perfect together.

1527
01:52:14,133 --> 01:52:16,099
Just like we do.

1528
01:52:16,167 --> 01:52:19,224
Ow!

1529
01:52:19,299 --> 01:52:24,322
Sorry. Now you know the real reason
why I like to dance alone.

1530
01:52:24,400 --> 01:52:28,832
It's okay.
You can step on my feet anytime.

1531
01:52:28,900 --> 01:52:32,458
Just, you know, next time I'll wear
some steel-toed shoes or something.

1532
01:52:57,033 --> 01:52:59,464
What are we thinking?

1533
01:52:59,533 --> 01:53:02,329
If only they knew
what we know.

1534
01:53:02,399 --> 01:53:05,922
Then it would be all too easy.

1535
01:53:05,999 --> 01:53:08,693
- The trumpet player--
- Hmm?

1536
01:53:08,766 --> 01:53:11,062
- Your friend?
- Yeah.

1537
01:53:11,133 --> 01:53:14,587
The one who said talking about love
is like dancing about architecture.

1538
01:53:14,666 --> 01:53:16,598
Mm-hmm.

1539
01:53:17,833 --> 01:53:21,196
Well, what do you say
we prove him wrong?

1540
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:29,591
I think we already have.
